gervaise
had
waited
up
for
lantier
until
two
in
the
morning
then
shivering
from
having
remained
in
a
thin
loose
jacket
exposed
to
the
fresh
air
at
the
window
she
had
thrown
herself
across
the
bed
drowsy
feverish
and
her
cheeks
bathed
in
tears
for
a
week
past
on
leaving
the
calf
where
they
took
their
meals
he
had
sent
her
home
with
the
children
and
never
reappeared
himself
till
late
at
night
alleging
that
he
had
been
in
search
of
work
that
evening
while
watching
for
his
return
she
thought
she
had
seen
him
enter
the
of
the
the
ten
blazing
windows
of
which
lighted
up
with
the
glare
of
a
conflagration
the
dark
expanse
of
the
exterior
boulevards
and
five
or
six
paces
behind
him
she
had
caught
sight
of
little
adele
a
burnisher
who
dined
at
the
same
restaurant
swinging
her
hands
as
if
she
had
just
quitted
his
arm
so
as
not
to
pass
together
under
the
dazzling
light
of
the
globes
at
the
door
when
towards
five
gervaise
awoke
stiff
and
sore
she
broke
forth
into
sobs
lantier
had
not
returned
for
the
first
time
he
had
slept
away
from
home
she
remained
seated
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
under
the
strip
of
faded
chintz
which
hung
from
the
rod
fastened
to
the
ceiling
by
a
piece
of
string
and
slowly
with
her
eyes
veiled
by
tears
she
glanced
round
the
wretched
lodging
furnished
with
a
walnut
chest
of
drawers
minus
one
drawer
three
chairs
and
a
little
greasy
table
on
which
stood
a
broken
there
had
been
added
for
the
children
an
iron
bedstead
which
prevented
any
one
getting
to
the
chest
of
drawers
and
filled
of
the
room
gervaise
and
lantier
trunk
wide
open
in
one
corner
displayed
its
emptiness
and
a
man
old
hat
right
at
the
bottom
almost
buried
beneath
some
dirty
shirts
and
socks
whilst
against
the
walls
above
the
articles
of
furniture
hung
a
shawl
full
of
holes
and
a
pair
of
trousers
begrimed
with
mud
the
last
rags
which
the
dealers
in
clothes
declined
to
buy
in
the
centre
of
the
lying
between
two
odd
zinc
was
a
bundle
of
pink
it
was
the
best
room
of
the
hotel
the
first
floor
room
looking
on
to
the
boulevard
the
two
children
were
sleeping
side
by
side
with
their
heads
on
the
same
pillow
claude
aged
eight
years
was
breathing
quietly
with
his
little
hands
thrown
outside
the
coverlet
while
etienne
only
four
years
old
was
smiling
with
one
arm
round
his
brother
neck
and
without
thinking
to
again
put
on
the
old
shoes
that
had
fallen
on
the
floor
she
resumed
her
position
at
the
window
her
eyes
searching
the
pavements
in
the
distance
the
hotel
was
situated
on
the
boulevard
de
la
chapelle
to
the
left
of
the
barriere
poissonniere
it
was
a
building
of
two
stories
high
painted
a
red
of
the
color
of
wine
dregs
up
to
the
second
floor
and
with
shutters
all
rotted
by
the
rain
over
a
lamp
with
starred
panes
of
glass
one
could
manage
to
read
between
the
two
windows
the
words
hotel
boncoeur
kept
by
marsoullier
painted
in
big
yellow
letters
several
pieces
of
which
the
moldering
of
the
plaster
had
carried
away
the
lamp
preventing
her
seeing
gervaise
raised
herself
on
tiptoe
still
holding
the
handkerchief
to
her
lips
she
looked
to
the
right
towards
the
boulevard
rochechouart
where
groups
of
butchers
in
aprons
smeared
with
blood
were
hanging
about
in
front
of
the
and
the
fresh
breeze
wafted
occasionally
a
stench
of
slaughtered
beasts
looking
to
the
left
she
scanned
a
long
avenue
that
ended
nearly
in
front
of
her
where
the
white
mass
of
the
lariboisiere
hospital
was
then
in
course
of
construction
slowly
from
one
end
of
the
horizon
to
the
other
she
followed
the
octroi
wall
behind
which
she
sometimes
heard
during
night
time
the
shrieks
of
persons
being
murdered
and
she
searchingly
looked
into
the
remote
angles
the
dark
corners
black
with
humidity
and
filth
fearing
to
discern
there
lantier
body
stabbed
to
death
she
looked
at
the
endless
gray
wall
that
surrounded
the
city
with
its
belt
of
desolation
when
she
raised
her
eyes
higher
she
became
aware
of
a
bright
burst
of
sunlight
the
dull
hum
of
the
city
awakening
already
filled
the
air
craning
her
neck
to
look
at
the
poissonniere
gate
she
remained
for
a
time
watching
the
constant
stream
of
men
horses
and
carts
which
flooded
down
from
the
heights
of
montmartre
and
la
chapelle
pouring
between
the
two
squat
octroi
lodges
it
was
like
a
herd
of
plodding
cattle
an
endless
throng
widened
by
sudden
stoppages
into
eddies
that
spilled
off
the
sidewalks
into
the
street
a
steady
procession
of
laborers
on
their
way
back
to
work
with
tools
slung
over
their
back
and
a
loaf
of
bread
under
their
arm
this
human
inundation
kept
pouring
down
into
paris
to
be
constantly
swallowed
up
gervaise
leaned
further
out
at
the
risk
of
falling
when
she
thought
she
recognized
lantier
among
the
throng
she
pressed
the
handkerchief
tighter
against
her
mouth
as
though
to
push
back
the
pain
within
her
the
sound
of
a
young
and
cheerful
voice
caused
her
to
leave
the
window
so
the
old
man
is
here
madame
lantier
why
no
monsieur
coupeau
she
replied
trying
to
smile
coupeau
a
who
occupied
a
ten
franc
room
on
the
top
floor
having
seen
the
door
unlocked
had
walked
in
as
friends
will
do
you
know
he
continued
i
now
working
over
there
in
the
hospital
what
beautiful
may
weather
is
it
the
air
is
rather
sharp
this
morning
and
he
looked
at
gervaise
face
red
with
weeping
when
he
saw
that
the
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
he
shook
his
head
gently
then
he
went
to
the
children
couch
where
they
were
sleeping
looking
as
rosy
as
cherubs
and
lowering
his
voice
he
said
come
the
old
man
not
been
home
has
he
do
worry
yourself
madame
lantier
he
very
much
occupied
with
politics
when
they
were
voting
for
eugene
sue
the
other
day
he
was
acting
almost
crazy
he
has
very
likely
spent
the
night
with
some
friends
blackguarding
crapulous
bonaparte
no
no
she
murmured
with
an
effort
you
do
think
that
i
know
where
lantier
is
you
see
we
have
our
little
troubles
like
the
rest
of
the
world
coupeau
winked
his
eye
to
indicate
he
was
not
a
dupe
of
this
falsehood
and
he
went
off
after
offering
to
fetch
her
milk
if
she
did
not
care
to
go
out
she
was
a
good
and
courageous
woman
and
might
count
upon
him
on
any
day
of
trouble
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
gervaise
again
returned
to
the
window
at
the
barriere
the
tramp
of
the
drove
still
continued
in
the
morning
air
locksmiths
in
short
blue
blouses
masons
in
white
jackets
house
painters
in
overcoats
over
long
smocks
from
a
distance
the
crowd
looked
like
a
chalky
smear
of
neutral
hue
composed
chiefly
of
faded
blue
and
dingy
gray
when
one
of
the
workers
occasionally
stopped
to
light
his
pipe
the
others
kept
plodding
past
him
without
sparing
a
laugh
or
a
word
to
a
comrade
with
cheeks
gray
as
clay
their
eyes
were
continually
drawn
toward
paris
which
was
swallowing
them
one
by
one
at
both
corners
of
the
rue
des
poissonniers
however
some
of
the
men
slackened
their
pace
as
they
neared
the
doors
of
the
two
who
were
taking
down
their
shutters
and
before
entering
they
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
looking
sideways
over
paris
with
no
strength
in
their
arms
and
already
inclined
for
a
day
of
idleness
inside
various
groups
were
already
buying
rounds
of
drinks
or
just
standing
around
forgetting
their
troubles
crowding
up
the
place
coughing
spitting
clearing
their
throats
with
sip
after
sip
gervaise
was
watching
pere
colombe
wineshop
to
the
left
of
the
street
where
she
thought
she
had
seen
lantier
when
a
stout
woman
bareheaded
and
wearing
an
apron
called
to
her
from
the
middle
of
the
roadway
hey
madame
lantier
you
up
very
early
gervaise
leaned
out
why
it
you
madame
boche
oh
i
got
a
lot
of
work
yes
things
do
do
themselves
do
they
the
conversation
continued
between
roadway
and
window
madame
boche
was
concierge
of
the
building
where
the
calf
was
on
the
ground
floor
gervaise
had
waited
for
lantier
more
than
once
in
the
lodge
so
as
not
to
be
alone
at
table
with
all
the
men
who
ate
at
the
restaurant
madame
boche
was
going
to
a
tailor
who
was
late
in
mending
an
overcoat
for
her
husband
she
mentioned
one
of
her
tenants
who
had
come
in
with
a
woman
the
night
before
and
kept
everybody
awake
past
three
in
the
morning
she
looked
at
gervaise
with
intense
curiosity
is
monsieur
lantier
then
still
in
bed
she
asked
abruptly
yes
he
asleep
replied
gervaise
who
could
not
avoid
blushing
madame
boche
saw
the
tears
come
into
her
eyes
and
satisfied
no
doubt
she
turned
to
go
declaring
men
to
be
a
cursed
lazy
set
as
she
went
off
she
called
back
it
this
morning
you
go
to
the
is
it
i
something
to
wash
too
i
keep
you
a
place
next
to
me
and
we
can
chat
together
then
as
if
moved
with
sudden
pity
she
added
my
poor
little
thing
you
had
far
better
not
remain
there
you
take
harm
you
look
quite
blue
with
cold
gervaise
still
obstinately
remained
at
the
window
during
two
mortal
hours
till
eight
now
all
the
shops
had
opened
only
a
few
work
men
were
still
hurrying
along
the
working
girls
now
filled
the
boulevard
metal
polishers
milliners
flower
sellers
shivering
in
their
thin
clothing
in
small
groups
they
chattered
gaily
laughing
and
glancing
here
and
there
occasionally
there
would
be
one
girl
by
herself
thin
pale
picking
her
way
along
the
city
wall
among
the
puddles
and
the
filth
after
the
working
girls
the
office
clerks
came
past
breathing
upon
their
chilled
fingers
and
munching
penny
rolls
some
of
them
are
gaunt
young
fellows
in
suits
their
tired
eyes
still
fogged
from
sleep
others
are
older
men
stooped
and
tottering
with
faces
pale
and
drawn
from
long
hours
of
office
work
and
glancing
nervously
at
their
watches
for
fear
of
arriving
late
in
time
the
boulevards
settle
into
their
usual
morning
quiet
old
folks
come
out
to
stroll
in
the
sun
tired
young
mothers
in
bedraggled
skirts
cuddle
babies
in
their
arms
or
sit
on
a
bench
to
change
diapers
children
run
squealing
and
laughing
pushing
and
shoving
then
gervaise
felt
herself
choking
dizzy
with
anguish
all
hopes
gone
it
seemed
to
her
that
everything
was
ended
even
time
itself
and
that
lantier
would
return
no
more
her
eyes
vacantly
wandered
from
the
old
foul
with
butchery
and
with
stench
to
the
new
white
hospital
which
through
the
yawning
openings
of
its
ranges
of
windows
disclosed
the
naked
wards
where
death
was
preparing
to
mow
in
front
of
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
octroi
wall
the
bright
heavens
dazzled
her
with
the
rising
sun
which
rose
higher
and
higher
over
the
vast
awaking
city
the
young
woman
was
seated
on
a
chair
no
longer
crying
and
with
her
hands
abandoned
on
her
lap
when
lantier
quietly
entered
the
room
it
you
it
you
she
cried
rising
to
throw
herself
upon
his
neck
yes
it
me
what
of
it
he
replied
you
are
not
going
to
begin
any
of
your
nonsense
i
hope
he
had
pushed
her
aside
then
with
a
gesture
of
he
threw
his
black
felt
hat
to
the
chest
of
drawers
he
was
a
young
fellow
of
years
of
age
short
and
very
dark
with
a
handsome
figure
and
slight
moustaches
which
his
hand
was
always
mechanically
twirling
he
wore
a
workman
overalls
and
an
old
soiled
overcoat
which
he
had
belted
tightly
at
the
waist
and
he
spoke
with
a
strong
provencal
accent
gervaise
who
had
fallen
back
on
her
chair
gently
complained
in
short
sentences
i
not
had
a
wink
of
sleep
i
feared
some
harm
had
happened
to
you
where
have
you
been
where
did
you
spend
the
night
for
heaven
sake
do
do
it
again
or
i
shall
go
crazy
tell
me
auguste
where
have
you
been
where
i
had
business
of
course
he
returned
shrugging
his
shoulders
at
eight
i
was
at
la
glaciere
with
my
friend
who
is
to
start
a
hat
factory
we
sat
talking
late
so
i
preferred
to
sleep
there
now
you
know
i
do
like
being
spied
upon
so
just
shut
up
the
young
woman
recommenced
sobbing
the
loud
voices
and
the
rough
movements
of
lantier
who
upset
the
chairs
had
awakened
the
children
they
sat
up
in
bed
half
naked
disentangling
their
hair
with
their
tiny
hands
and
hearing
their
mother
weep
they
uttered
terrible
screams
crying
also
with
their
scarcely
open
eyes
ah
there
the
music
shouted
lantier
furiously
i
warn
you
take
my
hook
and
it
will
be
for
good
this
time
you
wo
shut
up
then
good
morning
i
return
to
the
place
i
just
come
from
he
had
already
taken
his
hat
from
off
the
chest
of
drawers
but
gervaise
threw
herself
before
him
stammering
no
no
and
she
hushed
the
little
ones
tears
with
her
caresses
smoothed
their
hair
and
soothed
them
with
soft
words
the
children
suddenly
quieted
laughing
on
their
pillow
amused
themselves
by
punching
each
other
the
father
however
without
even
taking
off
his
boots
had
thrown
himself
on
the
bed
looking
worn
out
his
face
bearing
signs
of
having
been
up
all
night
he
did
not
go
to
sleep
he
lay
with
his
eyes
wide
open
looking
round
the
room
it
a
mess
here
he
muttered
and
after
observing
gervaise
a
moment
he
malignantly
added
do
you
even
wash
yourself
now
gervaise
was
tall
and
slim
with
fine
features
but
she
was
already
beginning
to
show
the
strain
of
her
hard
life
she
seemed
to
have
aged
ten
years
from
the
hours
of
agonized
weeping
lantier
mean
remark
made
her
mad
you
not
fair
she
said
spiritedly
you
well
know
i
do
all
i
can
it
not
my
fault
we
find
ourselves
here
i
would
like
to
see
you
with
two
children
in
a
room
where
there
not
even
a
stove
to
heat
some
water
when
we
arrived
in
paris
instead
of
squandering
your
money
you
should
have
made
a
home
for
us
at
once
as
you
promised
listen
lantier
exploded
you
cracked
the
nut
with
me
it
become
you
to
sneer
at
it
now
apparently
not
listening
gervaise
went
on
with
her
own
thought
if
we
work
hard
we
can
get
out
of
the
hole
we
in
madame
fauconnier
the
laundress
on
rue
neuve
will
start
me
on
monday
if
you
work
with
your
friend
from
la
glaciere
in
six
months
we
will
be
doing
well
we
have
enough
for
decent
clothes
and
a
place
we
can
call
our
own
but
have
to
stick
with
it
and
work
hard
lantier
turned
over
towards
the
wall
looking
greatly
bored
then
gervaise
lost
her
temper
yes
that
it
i
know
the
love
of
work
does
trouble
you
much
you
bursting
with
ambition
you
want
to
be
dressed
like
a
gentleman
you
do
think
me
nice
enough
do
you
now
that
you
made
me
pawn
all
my
dresses
listen
auguste
i
did
intend
to
speak
of
it
i
would
have
waited
a
bit
longer
but
i
know
where
you
spent
the
night
i
saw
you
enter
the
with
that
trollop
adele
ah
you
choose
them
well
she
a
nice
one
she
is
she
does
well
to
put
on
the
airs
of
a
princess
she
been
the
ridicule
of
every
man
who
frequents
the
restaurant
at
a
bound
lantier
sprang
from
the
bed
his
eyes
had
become
as
black
as
ink
in
his
pale
face
with
this
little
man
rage
blew
like
a
tempest
yes
yes
of
every
man
who
frequents
the
restaurant
repeated
the
young
woman
madame
boche
intends
to
give
them
notice
she
and
her
long
stick
of
a
sister
because
they
always
a
string
of
men
after
them
on
the
staircase
lantier
raised
his
fists
then
resisting
the
desire
of
striking
her
he
seized
hold
of
her
by
the
arms
shook
her
violently
and
sent
her
sprawling
upon
the
bed
of
the
children
who
recommenced
crying
and
he
lay
down
again
mumbling
like
a
man
resolving
on
something
that
he
previously
hesitated
to
do
you
do
know
what
you
done
gervaise
you
made
a
big
mistake
you
see
for
an
instant
the
children
continued
sobbing
their
mother
who
remained
bending
over
the
bed
held
them
both
in
her
embrace
and
kept
repeating
the
same
words
in
a
monotonous
tone
of
voice
ah
if
it
were
for
you
my
poor
little
ones
if
it
were
for
you
if
it
were
for
you
stretched
out
quietly
his
eyes
raised
to
the
faded
strip
of
chintz
lantier
no
longer
listened
but
seemed
to
be
buried
in
a
fixed
idea
he
remained
thus
for
nearly
an
hour
without
giving
way
to
sleep
in
spite
of
the
fatigue
which
weighed
his
eyelids
down
he
finally
turned
toward
gervaise
his
face
set
hard
in
determination
she
had
gotten
the
children
up
and
dressed
and
had
almost
finished
cleaning
the
room
the
room
looked
as
always
dark
and
depressing
with
its
sooty
black
ceiling
and
paper
peeling
from
the
damp
walls
the
dilapidated
furniture
was
always
streaked
and
dirty
despite
frequent
dustings
gervaise
devouring
her
grief
trying
to
assume
a
look
of
indifference
hurried
over
her
work
lantier
watched
as
she
tidied
her
hair
in
front
of
the
small
mirror
hanging
near
the
window
while
she
washed
herself
he
looked
at
her
bare
arms
and
shoulders
he
seemed
to
be
making
comparisons
in
his
mind
as
his
lips
formed
a
grimace
gervaise
limped
with
her
right
leg
though
it
was
scarcely
noticeable
except
when
she
was
tired
exhausted
from
remaining
awake
all
night
she
was
supporting
herself
against
the
wall
and
dragging
her
leg
neither
one
spoke
they
had
nothing
more
to
say
lantier
seemed
to
be
waiting
while
gervaise
kept
busy
and
tried
to
keep
her
countenance
expressionless
finally
while
she
was
making
a
bundle
of
the
dirty
clothes
thrown
in
a
corner
behind
the
trunk
he
at
length
opened
his
lips
and
asked
what
are
you
doing
there
where
are
you
going
she
did
not
answer
at
first
then
when
he
furiously
repeated
his
question
she
made
up
her
mind
and
said
i
suppose
you
can
see
for
yourself
i
going
to
wash
all
this
the
children
ca
live
in
filth
he
let
her
pick
up
two
or
three
handkerchiefs
and
after
a
fresh
pause
he
resumed
have
you
got
any
money
at
these
words
she
stood
up
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
without
leaving
go
of
the
children
dirty
clothes
which
she
held
in
her
hand
money
and
where
do
you
think
i
can
have
stolen
any
you
know
well
enough
that
i
got
three
francs
the
day
before
yesterday
on
my
black
skirt
we
lunched
twice
off
it
and
money
goes
quick
at
the
no
you
may
be
quite
sure
i
no
money
i
four
sous
for
the
i
do
have
an
extra
income
like
some
women
he
let
this
allusion
pass
he
had
moved
off
the
bed
and
was
passing
in
review
the
few
rags
hanging
about
the
room
he
ended
by
taking
up
the
pair
of
trousers
and
the
shawl
and
searching
the
drawers
he
added
two
chemises
and
a
woman
loose
jacket
to
the
parcel
then
he
threw
the
whole
bundle
into
gervaise
arms
saying
here
go
and
pop
this
do
you
want
me
to
pop
the
children
as
well
asked
she
eh
if
they
lent
on
children
it
would
be
a
fine
riddance
she
went
to
the
however
when
she
returned
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
she
laid
a
hundred
sou
piece
on
the
and
added
the
ticket
to
the
others
between
the
two
candlesticks
that
what
they
gave
me
said
she
i
wanted
six
francs
but
i
could
manage
it
oh
they
never
ruin
themselves
and
always
such
a
crowd
there
lantier
did
not
pick
up
the
five
franc
piece
directly
he
would
rather
that
she
got
change
so
as
to
leave
her
some
of
it
but
he
decided
to
slip
it
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
when
he
noticed
a
small
piece
of
ham
wrapped
up
in
paper
and
the
remains
of
a
loaf
on
the
chest
of
drawers
i
did
dare
go
to
the
milkwoman
because
we
owe
her
a
week
explained
gervaise
but
i
shall
be
back
early
you
can
get
some
bread
and
some
chops
whilst
i
away
and
then
we
have
lunch
bring
also
a
bottle
of
wine
he
did
not
say
no
their
quarrel
seemed
to
be
forgotten
the
young
woman
was
completing
her
bundle
of
dirty
clothes
but
when
she
went
to
take
lantier
shirts
and
socks
from
the
bottom
of
the
trunk
he
called
to
her
to
leave
them
alone
leave
my
things
d
hear
i
do
want
touched
what
it
you
do
want
touched
she
asked
rising
up
i
suppose
you
do
mean
to
put
these
filthy
things
on
again
do
you
they
must
be
washed
she
studied
his
boyishly
handsome
face
now
so
rigid
that
it
seemed
nothing
could
ever
soften
it
he
angrily
grabbed
his
things
from
her
and
threw
them
back
into
the
trunk
saying
just
obey
me
for
once
i
tell
you
i
wo
have
touched
but
why
she
asked
turning
pale
a
terrible
suspicion
crossing
her
mind
you
do
need
your
shirts
now
you
not
going
away
what
can
it
matter
to
you
if
i
take
them
he
hesitated
for
an
instant
embarrassed
by
the
piercing
glance
she
fixed
upon
him
why
why
stammered
he
because
you
go
and
tell
everyone
that
you
keep
me
that
you
wash
and
mend
well
it
worries
me
there
attend
to
your
own
business
and
i
attend
to
mine
washerwomen
do
work
for
dogs
she
supplicated
she
protested
she
had
never
complained
but
he
roughly
closed
the
trunk
and
sat
down
upon
it
saying
no
to
her
face
he
could
surely
do
as
he
liked
with
what
belonged
to
him
then
to
escape
from
the
inquiring
looks
she
leveled
at
him
he
went
and
laid
down
on
the
bed
again
saying
that
he
was
sleepy
and
requesting
her
not
to
make
his
head
ache
with
any
more
of
her
row
this
time
indeed
he
seemed
to
fall
asleep
gervaise
for
a
while
remained
undecided
she
was
tempted
to
kick
the
bundle
of
dirty
clothes
on
one
side
and
to
sit
down
and
sew
but
lantier
regular
breathing
ended
by
reassuring
her
she
took
the
ball
of
blue
and
the
piece
of
soap
remaining
from
her
last
washing
and
going
up
to
the
little
ones
who
were
quietly
playing
with
some
old
corks
in
front
of
the
window
she
kissed
them
and
said
in
a
low
voice
be
very
good
do
make
any
noise
papa
asleep
when
she
left
the
room
claude
and
etienne
gentle
laughter
alone
disturbed
the
great
silence
beneath
the
blackened
ceiling
it
was
ten
a
ray
of
sunshine
entered
by
the
half
open
window
on
the
boulevard
gervaise
turned
to
the
left
and
followed
the
rue
neuve
de
la
as
she
passed
madame
fauconnier
shop
she
slightly
bowed
her
head
the
she
was
bound
for
was
situated
towards
the
middle
of
the
street
at
the
part
where
the
roadway
commenced
to
ascend
the
rounded
gray
contours
of
the
three
large
zinc
wash
tanks
studded
with
rivets
rose
above
the
building
behind
them
was
the
drying
room
a
high
second
story
closed
in
on
all
sides
by
lattices
so
that
the
air
could
circulate
freely
and
through
which
laundry
could
be
seen
hanging
on
brass
wires
the
steam
engine
smokestack
exhaled
puffs
of
white
smoke
to
the
right
of
the
water
tanks
gervaise
was
used
to
puddles
and
did
not
bother
to
tuck
her
skirts
up
before
making
her
way
through
the
doorway
which
was
cluttered
with
jars
of
bleaching
water
she
was
already
acquainted
with
the
mistress
of
the
a
delicate
little
woman
with
red
inflamed
eyes
who
sat
in
a
small
glazed
closet
with
account
books
in
front
of
her
bars
of
soap
on
shelves
balls
of
blue
in
glass
bowls
and
pounds
of
soda
done
up
in
packets
and
as
she
passed
she
asked
for
her
beetle
and
her
which
she
had
left
to
be
taken
care
of
the
last
time
she
had
done
her
washing
there
then
after
obtaining
her
number
she
entered
the
it
was
an
immense
shed
with
large
clear
windows
and
a
flat
ceiling
showing
the
beams
supported
on
pillars
pale
rays
of
light
passed
through
the
hot
steam
which
remained
suspended
like
a
milky
fog
smoke
arose
from
certain
corners
spreading
about
and
covering
the
recesses
with
a
bluish
veil
a
heavy
moisture
hung
around
impregnated
with
a
soapy
odor
a
damp
insipid
smell
continuous
though
at
moments
overpowered
by
the
more
potent
fumes
of
the
chemicals
along
the
on
either
side
of
the
central
alley
were
rows
of
women
with
bare
arms
and
necks
and
skirts
tucked
up
showing
colored
stockings
and
heavy
shoes
they
were
beating
furiously
laughing
leaning
back
to
call
out
a
word
in
the
midst
of
the
din
or
stooping
over
their
tubs
all
of
them
brutal
ungainly
foul
of
speech
and
soaked
as
though
by
a
shower
with
their
flesh
red
and
reeking
all
around
the
women
continuously
flowed
a
river
from
buckets
emptied
with
a
sudden
splash
faucets
left
dripping
soap
suds
spattering
and
the
dripping
from
rinsed
laundry
which
was
hung
up
it
splashed
their
feet
and
drained
away
across
the
sloping
flagstones
the
din
of
the
shouting
and
the
rhythmic
beating
was
joined
by
the
patter
of
steady
dripping
it
was
slightly
muffled
by
the
ceiling
meanwhile
the
steam
engine
could
be
heard
as
it
puffed
and
snorted
ceaselessly
while
cloaked
in
its
white
mist
the
dancing
vibration
of
its
flywheel
seemed
to
regulate
the
volume
of
the
noisy
turbulence
gervaise
passed
slowly
along
the
alley
looking
to
the
right
and
left
carrying
her
laundry
bundle
under
one
arm
with
one
hip
thrust
high
and
limping
more
than
usual
she
was
jostled
by
several
women
in
the
hubbub
this
way
my
dear
cried
madame
boche
in
her
loud
voice
then
when
the
young
woman
had
joined
her
at
the
very
end
on
the
left
the
concierge
who
was
furiously
rubbing
a
dirty
sock
began
to
talk
incessantly
without
leaving
off
her
work
put
your
things
there
i
kept
your
place
oh
i
be
long
over
what
i
got
boche
scarcely
dirties
his
things
at
all
and
you
you
wo
be
long
either
will
you
your
bundle
quite
a
little
one
before
twelve
we
shall
have
finished
and
we
can
go
off
to
lunch
i
used
to
send
my
things
to
a
laundress
in
the
rue
poulet
but
she
destroyed
everything
with
her
chlorine
and
her
brushes
so
now
i
do
the
washing
myself
so
much
saved
it
only
costs
the
soap
i
say
you
should
have
put
those
shirts
to
soak
those
little
rascals
of
children
on
my
word
one
would
think
their
bodies
were
covered
with
soot
gervaise
having
undone
her
bundle
was
spreading
out
the
little
shirts
and
as
madame
boche
advised
her
to
take
a
pailful
of
lye
she
answered
oh
no
warm
water
will
do
i
used
to
it
she
had
sorted
her
laundry
with
several
colored
pieces
to
one
side
then
after
filling
her
tub
with
four
pails
of
cold
water
from
the
tap
behind
her
she
plunged
her
pile
of
whites
into
it
you
used
to
it
repeated
madame
boche
you
were
a
washerwoman
in
your
native
place
were
you
my
dear
gervaise
with
her
sleeves
pushed
back
displayed
the
graceful
arms
of
a
young
blonde
as
yet
scarcely
reddened
at
the
elbows
and
started
scrubbing
her
laundry
she
spread
a
shirt
out
on
the
narrow
rubbing
board
which
was
and
eroded
by
years
of
use
she
rubbed
soap
into
the
shirt
turned
it
over
and
soaped
the
other
side
before
replying
to
madame
boche
she
grasped
her
beetle
and
began
to
pound
away
so
that
her
shouted
phrases
were
punctuated
with
loud
and
rhythmic
thumps
yes
yes
a
washerwoman
when
i
was
ten
that
twelve
years
ago
we
used
to
go
to
the
river
it
smelt
nicer
there
than
it
does
here
you
should
have
seen
there
was
a
nook
under
the
trees
with
clear
running
water
you
know
at
plassans
do
you
know
plassans
it
near
marseilles
how
you
go
at
it
exclaimed
madame
boche
amazed
at
the
strength
of
her
blows
you
could
flatten
out
a
piece
of
iron
with
your
little
arms
the
conversation
continued
in
a
very
high
volume
at
times
the
concierge
not
catching
what
was
said
was
obliged
to
lean
forward
all
the
linen
was
beaten
and
with
a
will
gervaise
plunged
it
into
the
tub
again
and
then
took
it
out
once
more
each
article
separately
to
rub
it
over
with
soap
a
second
time
and
brush
it
with
one
hand
she
held
the
article
firmly
on
the
plank
with
the
other
which
grasped
the
short
brush
she
extracted
from
the
linen
a
dirty
lather
which
fell
in
long
drips
then
in
the
slight
noise
caused
by
the
brush
the
two
women
drew
together
and
conversed
in
a
more
intimate
way
no
we
not
married
resumed
gervaise
i
do
hide
it
lantier
is
so
nice
for
any
one
to
care
to
be
his
wife
if
it
were
for
the
children
i
was
fourteen
and
he
was
eighteen
when
we
had
our
first
one
it
happened
in
the
usual
way
you
know
how
it
is
i
was
happy
at
home
old
man
macquart
would
kick
me
in
the
tail
whenever
he
felt
like
it
for
no
reason
at
all
i
had
to
have
some
fun
outside
we
might
have
been
married
but
i
forget
why
our
parents
would
consent
she
shook
her
hands
which
were
growing
red
in
the
white
suds
the
water
awfully
hard
in
paris
madame
boche
was
now
washing
only
very
slowly
she
kept
leaving
off
making
her
work
last
as
long
as
she
could
so
as
to
remain
there
to
listen
to
that
story
which
her
curiosity
had
been
hankering
to
know
for
a
fortnight
past
her
mouth
was
half
open
in
the
midst
of
her
big
fat
face
her
eyes
which
were
almost
at
the
top
of
her
head
were
gleaming
she
was
thinking
with
the
satisfaction
of
having
guessed
right
that
it
the
little
one
gossips
too
much
there
been
a
row
then
she
observed
out
loud
he
is
nice
then
do
mention
it
replied
gervaise
he
used
to
behave
very
well
in
the
country
but
since
we
been
in
paris
he
been
unbearable
i
must
tell
you
that
his
mother
died
last
year
and
left
him
some
money
about
seventeen
hundred
francs
he
would
come
to
paris
so
as
old
macquart
was
forever
knocking
me
about
without
warning
i
consented
to
come
away
with
him
we
made
the
journey
with
two
children
he
was
to
set
me
up
as
a
laundress
and
work
himself
at
his
trade
of
a
hatter
we
should
have
been
very
happy
but
you
see
lantier
ambitious
and
a
spendthrift
a
fellow
who
only
thinks
of
amusing
himself
in
short
not
worth
much
on
arriving
we
went
to
the
hotel
montmartre
in
the
rue
montmartre
and
then
there
were
dinners
and
cabs
and
the
theatre
a
watch
for
himself
and
a
silk
dress
for
me
for
he
not
unkind
when
got
the
money
you
understand
he
went
in
for
everything
and
so
well
that
at
the
end
of
two
months
we
were
cleaned
out
it
was
then
that
we
came
to
live
at
the
hotel
boncoeur
and
that
this
horrible
life
began
she
interrupted
herself
a
lump
had
suddenly
risen
in
her
throat
and
she
could
scarcely
restrain
her
tears
she
had
finished
brushing
the
things
i
must
go
and
fetch
my
hot
water
she
murmured
but
madame
boche
greatly
disappointed
at
this
break
off
in
the
disclosures
called
to
the
boy
who
was
passing
my
little
charles
kindly
get
madame
a
pail
of
hot
water
she
in
a
hurry
the
youth
took
the
bucket
and
brought
it
back
filled
gervaise
paid
him
it
was
a
sou
the
pailful
she
poured
the
hot
water
into
the
tub
and
soaped
the
things
a
last
time
with
her
hands
leaning
over
them
in
a
mass
of
steam
which
deposited
small
beads
of
grey
vapor
in
her
light
hair
here
put
some
soda
in
i
got
some
by
me
said
the
concierge
obligingly
and
she
emptied
into
gervaise
tub
what
remained
of
a
bag
of
soda
which
she
had
brought
with
her
she
also
offered
her
some
of
the
chemical
water
but
the
young
woman
declined
it
it
was
only
good
for
grease
and
wine
stains
i
think
he
rather
a
loose
fellow
resumed
madame
boche
returning
to
lantier
but
without
naming
him
gervaise
bent
almost
double
her
hands
all
shriveled
and
thrust
in
amongst
the
clothes
merely
tossed
her
head
yes
yes
continued
the
other
i
have
noticed
several
little
things
but
she
suddenly
interrupted
herself
as
gervaise
jumped
up
with
a
pale
face
and
staring
wildly
at
her
then
she
exclaimed
oh
no
i
do
know
anything
he
likes
to
laugh
a
bit
i
think
that
all
for
instance
you
know
the
two
girls
who
lodge
at
my
place
adele
and
virginie
well
he
larks
about
with
but
he
just
flirts
for
sport
the
young
woman
standing
before
her
her
face
covered
with
perspiration
the
water
dripping
from
her
arms
continued
to
stare
at
her
with
a
fixed
and
penetrating
look
then
the
concierge
got
excited
giving
herself
a
blow
on
the
chest
and
pledging
her
word
of
honor
she
cried
i
know
nothing
i
mean
it
when
i
say
so
then
calming
herself
she
added
in
a
gentle
voice
as
if
speaking
to
a
person
on
whom
loud
protestations
would
have
no
effect
i
think
he
has
a
frank
look
about
the
eyes
he
marry
you
my
dear
i
sure
of
it
gervaise
wiped
her
forehead
with
her
wet
hand
shaking
her
head
again
she
pulled
another
garment
out
of
the
water
both
of
them
kept
silence
for
a
moment
the
was
quieting
down
for
eleven
had
struck
half
of
the
washerwomen
were
perched
on
the
edge
of
their
tubs
eating
sausages
between
slices
of
bread
and
drinking
from
open
bottles
of
wine
only
housewives
who
had
come
to
launder
small
bundles
of
family
linen
were
hurrying
to
finish
occasional
beetle
blows
could
still
be
heard
amid
the
subdued
laughter
and
gossip
by
the
greedy
chewing
of
jawbones
the
steam
engine
never
stopped
its
vibrant
snorting
voice
seemed
to
fill
the
entire
hall
though
not
one
of
the
women
even
heard
it
it
was
like
the
breathing
of
the
its
hot
breath
collecting
under
the
ceiling
rafters
in
an
eternal
floating
mist
the
heat
was
becoming
intolerable
through
the
tall
windows
on
the
left
sunlight
was
streaming
in
touching
the
steamy
vapors
with
opalescent
tints
of
soft
pinks
and
grayish
blues
charles
went
from
window
to
window
letting
down
the
heavy
canvas
awnings
then
he
crossed
to
the
shady
side
to
open
the
ventilators
he
was
applauded
by
cries
and
hand
clapping
and
a
rough
sort
of
gaiety
spread
around
soon
even
the
last
of
the
stopped
with
full
mouths
the
washerwomen
could
only
make
gestures
it
became
so
quiet
that
the
grating
sound
of
the
fireman
shoveling
coal
into
the
engine
firebox
could
be
heard
at
regular
intervals
from
far
at
the
other
end
gervaise
was
washing
her
colored
things
in
the
hot
water
thick
with
lather
which
she
had
kept
for
the
purpose
when
she
had
finished
she
drew
a
trestle
towards
her
and
hung
across
it
all
the
different
articles
the
drippings
from
which
made
bluish
puddles
on
the
floor
and
she
commenced
rinsing
behind
her
the
cold
water
tap
was
set
running
into
a
vast
tub
fixed
to
the
ground
and
across
which
were
two
wooden
bars
whereon
to
lay
the
clothes
high
up
in
the
air
were
two
other
bars
for
the
things
to
finish
dripping
on
we
almost
finished
and
not
a
bad
job
said
madame
boche
wait
and
help
you
wring
all
that
oh
it
not
worth
while
i
much
obliged
though
replied
the
young
woman
who
was
kneading
with
her
hands
and
sousing
the
colored
things
in
some
clean
water
if
i
any
sheets
it
would
be
another
thing
but
she
had
however
to
accept
the
concierge
assistance
they
were
wringing
between
them
one
at
each
end
a
woolen
skirt
of
a
chestnut
color
from
which
dribbled
a
yellowish
water
when
madame
boche
exclaimed
why
there
tall
virginie
what
has
she
come
here
to
wash
when
all
her
wardrobe
that
is
on
her
would
go
into
a
pocket
handkerchief
gervaise
jerked
her
head
up
virginie
was
a
girl
of
her
own
age
taller
than
she
was
dark
and
pretty
in
spite
of
her
face
being
rather
long
and
narrow
she
had
on
an
old
black
dress
with
flounces
and
a
red
ribbon
round
her
neck
and
her
hair
was
done
up
carefully
the
chignon
being
enclosed
in
a
blue
silk
net
she
stood
an
instant
in
the
middle
of
the
central
alley
screwing
up
her
eyes
as
though
seeking
someone
then
when
she
caught
sight
of
gervaise
she
passed
close
to
her
erect
insolent
and
with
a
swinging
gait
and
took
a
place
in
the
same
row
five
tubs
away
from
her
there
a
freak
for
you
continued
madame
boche
in
a
lower
tone
of
voice
she
never
does
any
laundry
not
even
a
pair
of
cuffs
a
seamstress
who
does
even
sew
on
a
loose
button
she
just
like
her
sister
the
brass
burnisher
that
hussy
adele
who
stays
away
from
her
job
two
days
out
of
three
nobody
knows
who
their
folks
are
or
how
they
make
a
living
though
if
i
wanted
to
talk
what
on
earth
is
she
scrubbing
there
a
filthy
petticoat
i
wager
it
seen
some
lovely
sights
that
petticoat
madame
boche
was
evidently
trying
to
make
herself
agreeable
to
gervaise
the
truth
was
she
often
took
a
cup
of
coffee
with
adele
and
virginia
when
the
girls
had
any
money
gervaise
did
not
answer
but
hurried
over
her
work
with
feverish
hands
she
had
just
prepared
her
blue
in
a
little
tub
that
stood
on
three
legs
she
dipped
in
the
linen
things
and
shook
them
an
instant
at
the
bottom
of
the
colored
water
the
reflection
of
which
had
a
pinky
tinge
and
after
wringing
them
lightly
she
spread
them
out
on
the
wooden
bars
up
above
during
the
time
she
was
occupied
with
this
work
she
made
a
point
of
turning
her
back
on
virginie
but
she
heard
her
chuckles
she
could
feel
her
sidelong
glances
virginie
appeared
only
to
have
come
there
to
provoke
her
at
one
moment
gervaise
having
turned
around
they
both
stared
into
each
other
faces
leave
her
alone
whispered
madame
boche
you
not
going
to
pull
each
other
hair
out
i
hope
when
i
tell
you
there
nothing
to
it
it
is
her
anyhow
at
this
moment
as
the
young
woman
was
hanging
up
the
last
article
of
clothing
there
was
a
sound
of
laughter
at
the
door
of
the
here
are
two
brats
who
want
their
mamma
cried
charles
all
the
women
leant
forward
gervaise
recognized
claude
and
etienne
as
soon
as
they
caught
sight
of
her
they
ran
to
her
through
the
puddles
the
heels
of
their
unlaced
shoes
resounding
on
the
flagstones
claude
the
eldest
held
his
little
brother
by
the
hand
the
women
as
they
passed
them
uttered
little
exclamations
of
affection
as
they
noticed
their
frightened
though
smiling
faces
and
they
stood
there
in
front
of
their
mother
without
leaving
go
of
each
other
hands
and
holding
their
fair
heads
erect
has
papa
sent
you
asked
gervaise
but
as
she
stooped
to
tie
the
laces
of
etienne
shoes
she
saw
the
key
of
their
room
on
one
of
claude
fingers
with
the
brass
number
hanging
from
it
why
you
brought
the
key
she
said
greatly
surprised
what
that
for
the
child
seeing
the
key
which
he
had
forgotten
on
his
finger
appeared
to
recollect
and
exclaimed
in
his
clear
voice
papa
gone
away
he
gone
to
buy
the
lunch
and
told
you
to
come
here
to
fetch
me
claude
looked
at
his
brother
hesitated
no
longer
recollecting
then
he
resumed
all
in
a
breath
papa
gone
away
he
jumped
off
the
bed
he
put
all
the
things
in
the
trunk
he
carried
the
trunk
down
to
a
cab
he
gone
away
gervaise
who
was
squatting
down
slowly
rose
to
her
feet
her
face
ghastly
pale
she
put
her
hands
to
her
cheeks
and
temples
as
though
she
felt
her
head
was
breaking
and
she
could
find
only
these
words
which
she
repeated
twenty
times
in
the
same
tone
of
voice
ah
good
heavens
ah
good
heavens
ah
good
heavens
madame
boche
however
also
questioned
the
child
quite
delighted
at
the
chance
of
hearing
the
whole
story
come
little
one
you
must
tell
us
just
what
happened
it
was
he
who
locked
the
door
and
who
told
you
to
bring
the
key
was
it
and
lowering
her
voice
she
whispered
in
claude
ear
was
there
a
lady
in
the
cab
the
child
again
got
confused
then
he
recommenced
his
story
in
a
triumphant
manner
he
jumped
off
the
bed
he
put
all
the
things
in
the
trunk
he
gone
away
then
when
madame
boche
let
him
go
he
drew
his
brother
in
front
of
the
tap
and
they
amused
themselves
by
turning
on
the
water
gervaise
was
unable
to
cry
she
was
choking
leaning
back
against
her
tub
her
face
still
buried
in
her
hands
brief
shudders
rocked
her
body
and
she
wailed
out
long
sighs
while
pressing
her
hands
tighter
against
her
eyes
as
though
abandoning
herself
to
the
blackness
of
desolation
a
dark
deep
pit
into
which
she
seemed
to
be
falling
come
my
dear
pull
yourself
together
murmured
madame
boche
if
you
only
knew
if
you
only
knew
said
she
at
length
very
faintly
he
sent
me
this
morning
to
pawn
my
shawl
and
my
chemises
to
pay
for
that
cab
and
she
burst
out
crying
the
memory
of
the
events
of
that
morning
and
of
her
trip
to
the
tore
from
her
the
sobs
that
had
been
choking
her
throat
that
abominable
trip
to
the
was
the
thing
that
hurt
most
in
all
her
sorrow
and
despair
tears
were
streaming
down
her
face
but
she
did
think
of
using
her
handkerchief
be
reasonable
do
be
quiet
everyone
looking
at
you
madame
boche
who
hovered
round
her
kept
repeating
how
can
you
worry
yourself
so
much
on
account
of
a
man
you
loved
him
then
all
the
same
did
you
my
poor
darling
a
little
while
ago
you
were
saying
all
sorts
of
things
against
him
and
now
you
crying
for
him
and
almost
breaking
your
heart
dear
me
how
silly
we
all
are
then
she
became
quite
maternal
a
pretty
little
woman
like
you
can
it
be
possible
one
may
tell
you
everything
now
i
suppose
well
you
recollect
when
i
passed
under
your
window
i
already
had
my
suspicions
just
fancy
last
night
when
adele
came
home
i
heard
a
man
footsteps
with
hers
so
i
thought
i
would
see
who
it
was
i
looked
up
the
staircase
the
fellow
was
already
on
the
second
landing
but
i
certainly
recognized
monsieur
lantier
overcoat
boche
who
was
on
the
watch
this
morning
saw
him
tranquilly
nod
adieu
he
was
with
adele
you
know
virginie
has
a
situation
now
where
she
goes
twice
a
week
only
it
highly
imprudent
all
the
same
for
only
one
room
and
an
alcove
and
i
ca
very
well
say
where
virginie
managed
to
sleep
she
interrupted
herself
an
instant
turned
round
and
then
resumed
subduing
her
loud
voice
she
laughing
at
seeing
you
cry
that
heartless
thing
over
there
stake
my
life
that
her
washing
all
a
pretence
she
packed
off
the
other
two
and
she
come
here
so
as
to
tell
them
how
you
take
it
gervaise
removed
her
hands
from
her
face
and
looked
when
she
beheld
virginie
in
front
of
her
amidst
three
or
four
women
speaking
low
and
staring
at
her
she
was
seized
with
a
mad
rage
her
arms
in
front
of
her
searching
the
ground
she
stumbled
forward
a
few
paces
trembling
all
over
she
found
a
bucket
full
of
water
grabbed
it
with
both
hands
and
emptied
it
at
virginie
the
virago
yelled
tall
virginie
she
had
stepped
back
and
her
boots
alone
got
wet
the
other
women
who
for
some
minutes
past
had
all
been
greatly
upset
by
gervaise
tears
jostled
each
other
in
their
anxiety
to
see
the
fight
some
who
were
finishing
their
lunch
got
on
the
tops
of
their
tubs
others
hastened
forward
their
hands
smothered
with
soap
a
ring
was
formed
ah
the
virago
repeated
tall
virginie
what
the
matter
with
her
she
mad
gervaise
standing
on
the
defensive
her
chin
thrust
out
her
features
convulsed
said
nothing
not
having
yet
acquired
the
paris
gift
of
street
gab
the
other
continued
get
out
this
girl
tired
of
wallowing
about
in
the
country
she
was
twelve
years
old
when
the
soldiers
were
at
her
she
even
lost
her
leg
serving
her
country
that
leg
rotting
off
the
burst
out
laughing
virginie
seeing
her
success
advanced
a
couple
of
steps
drawing
herself
up
to
her
full
height
and
yelling
louder
than
ever
here

a
bit
nearer
just
to
see
how

leash

husband

a
reward
the
laughter
burst
forth
again
gervaise
contented
herself
with
continually
murmuring
in
a
low
tone
of
voice

sister

a
trifle
different
to
you
but
what

wash

just
dry
up

but
it
was
she
who
returned
to
the
attack
after
giving
five
or
six
strokes
with
her
beetle
intoxicated
by
the
insults
she
had
been
giving
utterance
to
and
worked
up
into
a
passion
she
left
off
and
recommenced
again
speaking
in
this
way
three
times
well
yes

sister

you

over
their
faces

one
of
them
from
a
gendarme

you
and
you
let
three
others
die
because

fine
things

had
enough
of
you
you
dirty

yelled
gervaise
beside
herself
and
again
seized
with
a
furious
trembling
she
turned
round
looking
once
more
about
the
ground
and
only
observing
the
little
tub
she
seized
hold
of
it
by
the
legs
and
flung
the
whole
of
the
bluing
at
virginie
face
the
beast
she
spoilt
my
dress
cried
the
latter
whose
shoulder
was
sopping
wet
and
whose
left
hand
was
dripping
blue
just
wait
you
wretch
in
her
turn
she
seized
a
bucket
and
emptied
it
over
gervaise
then
a
formidable
battle
began
they
both
ran
along
the
rows
of
tubs
seized
hold
of
the
pails
that
were
full
and
returned
to
dash
the
contents
at
each
other
heads
and
each
deluge
was
accompanied
by
a
volley
of
words
gervaise
herself
answered
now
there
you
scum
you
got
it
that
time
it
help
to
cool
you
ah
the
carrion
that
for
your
filth

salt
out
of
you
you
cod
another

brush
your
teeth

yourself
up
for
your
post
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
belhomme
they
ended
by
having
to
refill
the
buckets
at
the
water
taps
continuing
to
insult
each
other
the
while
the
initial
bucketfuls
were
so
poorly
aimed
as
to
scarcely
reach
their
targets
but
they
soon
began
to
splash
each
other
in
earnest
virginie
was
the
first
to
receive
a
bucketful
in
the
face
the
water
ran
down
soaking
her
back
and
front
she
was
still
staggering
when
another
caught
her
from
the
side
hitting
her
left
ear
and
drenching
her
chignon
which
then
came
unwound
into
a
limp
bedraggled
string
of
hair
gervaise
was
hit
first
in
the
legs
one
pail
filled
her
shoes
full
of
water
and
splashed
up
to
her
thighs
two
more
wet
her
even
higher
soon
both
of
them
were
soaked
from
top
to
bottom
and
it
was
impossible
to
count
the
hits
their
clothes
were
plastered
to
their
bodies
and
they
looked
shrunken
water
was
dripping
everywhere
as
from
umbrellas
in
a
rainstorm
they
look
jolly
funny
said
the
hoarse
voice
of
one
of
the
women
everyone
in
the
was
highly
amused
a
good
space
was
left
to
the
combatants
as
nobody
cared
to
get
splashed
applause
and
jokes
circulated
in
the
midst
of
the
noise
of
the
buckets
emptied
in
rapid
succession
on
the
floor
the
puddles
were
running
one
into
another
and
the
two
women
were
wading
in
them
up
to
their
ankles
virginie
however
who
had
been
meditating
a
treacherous
move
suddenly
seized
hold
of
a
pail
of
lye
which
one
of
her
neighbors
had
left
there
and
threw
it
the
same
cry
arose
from
all
everyone
thought
gervaise
was
scalded
but
only
her
left
foot
had
been
slightly
touched
and
exasperated
by
the
pain
she
seized
a
bucket
without
troubling
herself
to
fill
it
this
time
and
threw
it
with
all
her
might
at
the
legs
of
virginie
who
fell
to
the
ground
all
the
women
spoke
together
she
broken
one
of
her
limbs
well
the
other
tried
to
cook
her
she
right
after
all
the
blonde
one
if
her
man
been
taken
from
her
madame
boche
held
up
her
arms
to
heaven
uttering
all
sorts
of
exclamations
she
had
prudently
retreated
out
of
the
way
between
two
tubs
and
the
children
claude
and
etienne
crying
choking
terrified
clung
to
her
dress
with
the
continuous
cry
of
mamma
mamma
broken
by
their
sobs
when
she
saw
virginie
fall
she
hastened
forward
and
tried
to
pull
gervaise
away
by
her
skirt
repeating
the
while
come
now
go
home
be
reasonable
on
my
word
it
quite
upset
me
never
was
such
a
butchery
seen
before
but
she
had
to
draw
back
and
seek
refuge
again
between
the
two
tubs
with
the
children
virginie
had
just
flown
at
gervaise
throat
she
squeezed
her
round
the
neck
trying
to
strangle
her
the
latter
freed
herself
with
a
violent
jerk
and
in
her
turn
hung
on
to
the
hair
as
though
she
was
trying
to
pull
her
head
off
the
battle
was
silently
resumed
without
a
cry
without
an
insult
they
did
not
seize
each
other
round
the
body
they
attacked
each
other
faces
with
open
hands
and
clawing
fingers
pinching
scratching
whatever
they
caught
hold
of
the
tall
dark
girl
red
ribbon
and
blue
silk
hair
net
were
torn
off
the
body
of
her
dress
giving
way
at
the
neck
displayed
a
large
portion
of
her
shoulder
whilst
the
blonde
half
stripped
a
sleeve
gone
from
her
loose
white
jacket
without
her
knowing
how
had
a
rent
in
her
underlinen
which
exposed
to
view
the
naked
line
of
her
waist
shreds
of
stuff
flew
in
all
directions
it
was
from
gervaise
that
the
first
blood
was
drawn
three
long
scratches
from
the
mouth
to
the
chin
and
she
sought
to
protect
her
eyes
shutting
them
at
every
grab
the
other
made
for
fear
of
having
them
torn
out
no
blood
showed
on
virginie
as
yet
gervaise
aimed
at
her
ears
maddened
at
not
being
able
to
reach
them
at
length
she
succeeded
in
seizing
hold
of
one
of
the
earrings
an
imitation
pear
in
yellow
glass
which
she
pulled
out
and
slit
the
ear
and
the
blood
flowed
they
killing
each
other
separate
them
the
vixens
exclaimed
several
voices
the
other
women
had
drawn
nearer
they
formed
themselves
into
two
camps
some
were
cheering
the
combatants
on
as
the
others
were
trembling
and
turning
their
heads
away
saying
that
it
was
making
them
sick
a
large
fight
nearly
broke
out
between
the
two
camps
as
the
women
called
each
other
names
and
brandished
their
fists
threateningly
three
loud
slaps
rang
out
madame
boche
meanwhile
was
trying
to
discover
the
boy
charles
charles
wherever
has
he
got
to
and
she
found
him
in
the
front
rank
looking
on
with
his
arms
folded
he
was
a
big
fellow
with
an
enormous
neck
he
was
laughing
and
enjoying
the
sight
of
the
skin
which
the
two
women
displayed
the
little
blonde
was
as
fat
as
a
quail
it
would
be
fun
if
her
chemise
burst
open
why
murmured
he
blinking
his
eye
she
got
a
strawberry
birthmark
under
her
arm
what
you
there
cried
madame
boche
as
she
caught
sight
of
him
just
come
and
help
us
separate
them
you
can
easily
separate
them
you
can
oh
no
thank
you
not
if
i
know
it
said
he
coolly
to
get
my
eye
scratched
like
i
did
the
other
day
i
suppose
i
not
here
for
that
sort
of
thing
i
have
enough
to
do
without
that
do
be
afraid
a
little
bleeding
does
good
it
soften
the
concierge
then
talked
of
fetching
the
police
but
the
mistress
of
the
the
delicate
young
woman
with
the
red
inflamed
eyes
would
not
allow
her
to
do
this
she
kept
saying
no
no
i
wo
it
compromise
my
establishment
the
struggle
on
the
ground
continued
all
on
a
sudden
virginie
raised
herself
up
on
her
knees
she
had
just
gotten
hold
of
a
beetle
and
held
it
on
high
she
had
a
rattle
in
her
throat
and
in
an
altered
voice
she
exclaimed
here
something
that
settle
you
get
your
dirty
linen
ready
gervaise
quickly
thrust
out
her
hand
and
also
seized
a
beetle
and
held
it
up
like
a
club
and
she
too
spoke
in
a
choking
voice
ah
you
want
to
let
me
get
hold
of
your
skin
that
i
may
beat
it
into
for
a
moment
they
remained
there
on
their
knees
menacing
each
other
their
hair
all
over
their
faces
their
breasts
heaving
muddy
swelling
with
rage
they
watched
one
another
as
they
waited
and
took
breath
gervaise
gave
the
first
blow
her
beetle
glided
off
virginie
shoulder
and
she
at
once
threw
herself
on
one
side
to
avoid
the
latter
beetle
which
grazed
her
hip
then
warming
to
their
work
they
struck
at
each
other
like
washerwomen
beating
clothes
roughly
and
in
time
whenever
there
was
a
hit
the
sound
was
deadened
so
that
one
might
have
thought
it
a
blow
in
a
tub
full
of
water
the
other
women
around
them
no
longer
laughed
several
had
gone
off
saying
that
it
quite
upset
them
those
who
remained
stretched
out
their
necks
their
eyes
lighted
up
with
a
gleam
of
cruelty
admiring
the
pluck
displayed
madame
boche
had
led
claude
and
etienne
away
and
one
could
hear
at
the
other
end
of
the
building
the
sound
of
their
sobs
mingled
with
the
sonorous
shocks
of
the
two
beetles
but
gervaise
suddenly
yelled
virginie
had
caught
her
a
whack
with
all
her
might
on
her
bare
arm
just
above
the
elbow
a
large
red
mark
appeared
the
flesh
at
once
began
to
swell
then
she
threw
herself
upon
virginie
and
everyone
thought
she
was
going
to
beat
her
to
death
enough
enough
was
cried
on
all
sides
her
face
bore
such
a
terrible
expression
that
no
one
dared
approach
her
her
strength
seemed
to
have
increased
tenfold
she
seized
virginie
round
the
waist
bent
her
down
and
pressed
her
face
against
the
flagstones
raising
her
beetle
she
commenced
beating
as
she
used
to
beat
at
plassans
on
the
banks
of
the
viorne
when
her
mistress
washed
the
clothes
of
the
garrison
the
wood
seemed
to
yield
to
the
flesh
with
a
damp
sound
at
each
whack
a
red
weal
marked
the
white
skin
oh
oh
exclaimed
the
boy
charles
opening
his
eyes
to
their
full
extent
and
gloating
over
the
sight
laughter
again
burst
forth
from
the
but
soon
the
cry
enough
enough
recommenced
gervaise
heard
not
neither
did
she
tire
she
examined
her
work
bent
over
it
anxious
not
to
leave
a
dry
place
she
wanted
to
see
the
whole
of
that
skin
beaten
covered
with
contusions
and
she
talked
seized
with
a
ferocious
gaiety
recalling
a
washerwoman
song
bang
bang
margot
at
her
tub
bang
bang
beating
bang
bang
tries
to
wash
her
heart
bang
bang
black
with
grief
to
part
and
then
she
resumed
that
for
you
that
for
your
sister
that
for
lantier
when
you
next
see
them
you
can
give
them
that
attention

going
to
begin

for
your

for
you
bang
bang
margot
at
her
tub
bang

the
others
were
obliged
to
drag
virginie
away
from
her
the
tall
dark
girl
her
face
bathed
in
tears
and
purple
with
shame
picked
up
her
things
and
hastened
away
she
was
vanquished
gervaise
slipped
on
the
sleeve
of
her
jacket
again
and
fastened
up
her
petticoats
her
arm
pained
her
a
good
deal
and
she
asked
madame
boche
to
place
her
bundle
of
clothes
on
her
shoulder
the
concierge
referred
to
the
battle
spoke
of
her
emotions
and
talked
of
examining
the
young
woman
person
just
to
see
you
may
perhaps
have
something
broken
i
heard
a
tremendous
blow
but
gervaise
wanted
to
go
home
she
made
no
reply
to
the
pitying
remarks
and
noisy
ovation
of
the
other
women
who
surrounded
her
erect
in
their
aprons
when
she
was
laden
she
gained
the
door
where
the
children
awaited
her
two
hours
that
makes
two
sous
said
the
mistress
of
the
already
back
at
her
post
in
the
glazed
closet
why
two
sous
she
no
longer
understood
that
she
was
asked
to
pay
for
her
place
there
then
she
gave
the
two
sous
and

very
much
beneath
the
weight
of
the
wet
clothes
on
her
shoulder
the
water
dripping
from
off

her
elbow
black
and
blue
her
cheek
covered
with
blood
she
went
off
dragging
claude
and
etienne
with
her
bare
arms
whilst
they
trotted
along
on
either
side
of
her
still
trembling
and
their
faces
besmeared
with
their
tears
once
she
was
gone
the
resumed
its
roaring
tumult
the
washerwomen
had
eaten
their
bread
and
drunk
their
wine
their
faces
were
lit
up
and
their
spirits
enlivened
by
the
fight
between
gervaise
and
virginie
the
long
lines
of
tubs
were
astir
again
with
the
fury
of
thrashing
arms
of
craggy
profiles
of
marionettes
with
bent
backs
and
slumping
shoulders
that
twisted
and
jerked
violently
as
though
on
hinges
conversations
went
on
from
one
end
to
the
other
in
loud
voices
laughter
and
coarse
remarks
crackled
through
the
ceaseless
gurgling
of
the
water
faucets
were
sputtering
buckets
spilling
rivulets
flowing
underneath
the
rows
of
washboards
throughout
the
huge
shed

wisps
of
steam
reflected
a
reddish
tint
pierced
here
and
there
by
disks
of
sunlight
golden
globes
that
had
leaked
through
holes
in
the
awnings
the
air
was
stiflingly
warm
and
odorous
with
soap
suddenly
the
hall
was
filled
with
a
white
mist
the
huge
copper
lid
of
the
kettle
was
rising
mechanically
along
a
notched
shaft
and
from
the
gaping
copper
hollow
within
its
wall
of
bricks
came
whirling
clouds
of
vapor
meanwhile
at
one
side
the
drying
machines
were
hard
at
work
within
their
cylinders
bundles
of
laundry
were
being
wrung
dry

the
centrifugal

mastered
her
it
was
a
dark
narrow
passage
with
a
gutter
for
the
dirty
water
running
alongside
the
wall
and
the
stench
which
she
again
encountered
there
caused
her
to
think
of
the
fortnight
she
had
passed
in
the
place
with
lantier
a
fortnight
of
misery
and
quarrels
the
recollection
of
which
was
now
a
bitter
regret
it
seemed
to
bring
her
abandonment

her
upstairs
the

entered
through

her

about

herself
for
a

contemplation

long
gray
avenue

that
very
morning
she
had
watched
the
awakening
of
the
working

immense
of

hour
immense
heat

rising
from
the

from

with

little
ones

she
glanced
up
and
down

boulevard

was
seized
with
a
dull
dread
that
her
life
would
be
fixed
there
forever

a
and
a

coupeau
who
had
been
smoking
a
cigarette
on
the
pavement
had
prevailed
on
her
to
go
inside
as
she
returned
from
taking
home
a
customer
washing
and
her
big
square
laundress
basket
was
on
the
floor
beside
her
behind
the
little

said
distillery
two
dusty
oleanders
planted
in
half
casks
stood
beside
the
doorway
a
long
bar
with
its
tin
measuring
cups
was
on
the
left
as
you
entered
the
large
room
was
decorated
with
casks
painted
a
gay
yellow
bright
with
varnish
and
gleaming
with
copper
taps
and
hoops
on
the
shelves
above
the
bar
were
liquor
bottles
jars
of
fruit
preserved
in
brandy
and
flasks
of
all
shapes
they
completely
covered
the
wall
and
were
reflected
in
the
mirror
behind
the
bar
as
colorful
spots
of
apple
green
pale
gold
and
soft
brown
the
main
feature
of
the
establishment
however
was
the
distilling
apparatus
it
was
at
the
rear
behind
an
oak
railing
in
a
area
the
customers
could
watch
its
functioning
copper

nearly
empty
at
the
lunch
hour
pere
colombe
a
heavy
man
of
forty
was
serving
a
ten
year
old
girl
who
had
asked
him
to
place
four
sous
worth
of
brandy
into
her
cup
a
shaft
of
sunlight
came
through
the
entrance
to
warm
the
floor
which
was
always
damp
from
the
smokers
spitting
from
everything
the
casks
the
bar
the
entire
room
a
liquorish
odor
arose
an
alcoholic
aroma
which
seemed
to
thicken
and
befuddle
the
dust
motes
dancing
in
the
sunlight
coupeau
was
making
another
cigarette
he
was
very
neat
in
a
short
blue
linen
blouse
and
cap
and
was
laughing
and
showing
his
white
teeth
with
a
projecting
under
jaw
and
a
slightly
snub
nose
he
had
handsome
chestnut
eyes
and
the
face
of
a
jolly
dog
and
a
thorough
good
fellow
his
coarse
curly
hair
stood
erect
his
skin
still
preserved
the
softness
of
his
years
opposite
to
him
gervaise
in
a
thin
black
woolen
dress
and
bareheaded
was
finishing
her
plum
which
she
held
by
the
stalk
between
the
tips
of
her
fingers
they
were
close
to
the
street
at
the
first
of
the
four
tables
placed
alongside
the
barrels
facing
the
bar
when
the
had
lit
his
cigarette
he
placed
his
elbows
on
the
table
thrust
his
face
forward
and
for
an
instant
looked
without
speaking
at
the
young
woman
whose
pretty
fair
face
had
that
day
the
milky
transparency
of
china
then
alluding
to
a
matter
known
to
themselves
alone
and
already
discussed
between
them
he
simply
asked
in
a
low
voice
so
it
to
be
you
say
oh
most
decidedly
monsieur
coupeau
quietly
replied
gervaise
with
a
smile
i
hope
you
not
going
to
talk
to
me
about
that
here
you
know
you
promised
me
you
would
be
reasonable
had
i
known
i
would
have
let
you
treat
me
coupeau
kept
silence
looking
at
her
intently
with
a
boldness
she
sat
still
at
ease
and
friendly
at
the
end
of
a
brief
silence
she
added
you
ca
really
mean
it
i
an
old
woman
i
a
big
boy
eight
years
old
whatever
could
we
two
do
together
why
murmured
coupeau
blinking
his
eyes
what
the
others
do
of
course
get
married
she
made
a
gesture
of
feeling
annoyed
oh
do
you
think
it
always
pleasant
one
can
very
well
see
you
never
seen
much
of
living
no
monsieur
coupeau
i
must
think
of
serious
things
burdening
oneself
never
leads
to
anything
you
know
i
two
mouths
at
home
which
are
never
tired
of
swallowing
i
can
tell
you
how
do
you
suppose
i
can
bring
up
my
little
ones
if
i
only
sit
here
talking
indolently
and
listen
besides
that
my
misfortune
has
been
a
famous
lesson
to
me
you
know
i
do
care
a
bit
about
men
now
they
wo
catch
me
again
for
a
long
while
she
spoke
with
such
cool
objectivity
that
it
was
clear
she
had
resolved
this
in
her
mind
turning
it
about
thoroughly
coupeau
was
deeply
moved
and
kept
repeating
i
feel
so
sorry
for
you
it
causes
me
a
great
deal
of
pain
yes
i
know
that
resumed
she
and
i
am
sorry
monsieur
coupeau
but
you
must
take
it
to
heart
if
i
had
any
idea
of
enjoying
myself
dieu
i
would
certainly
rather
be
with
you
than
anyone
else
a
good
boy
and
gentle
only
where
the
use
as
i
no
inclination
to
wed
i
been
for
the
last
fortnight
now
at
madame
fauconnier
the
children
go
to
school
i
work
i
contented
so
the
best
is
to
remain
as
we
are
is
it
and
she
stooped
down
to
take
her
basket
you
making
me
talk
they
must
be
expecting
me
at
the
shop
easily
find
someone
else
prettier
than
i
monsieur
coupeau
and
who
wo
have
two
boys
to
drag
about
with
her
he
looked
at
the
clock
inserted
in
the
of
the
mirror
and
made
her
sit
down
again
exclaiming
do
be
in
such
a
hurry
it
only
eleven
i
still
minutes
you
do
have
to
be
afraid
that
i
shall
do
anything
foolish
there
the
table
between
us
so
you
detest
me
so
much
that
you
wo
stay
and
have
a
little
chat
with
me
she
put
her
basket
down
again
so
as
not
to
disoblige
him
and
they
conversed
like
good
friends
she
had
eaten
her
lunch
before
going
out
with
the
laundry
he
had
gulped
down
his
soup
and
beef
hurriedly
to
be
able
to
wait
for
her
all
the
while
she
chatted
amiably
gervaise
kept
looking
out
the
window
at
the
activity
on
the
street
it
was
now
unusually
crowded
with
the
lunch
time
rush
everywhere
were
hurried
steps
swinging
arms
and
pushing
elbows
some
late
comers
hungry
and
angry
at
being
kept
extra
long
at
the
job
rushed
across
the
street
into
the
bakery
they
emerged
with
a
loaf
of
bread
and
went
three
doors
farther
to
the
calf
to
gobble
down
a
meat
dish
next
door
to
the
bakery
was
a
grocer
who
sold
fried
potatoes
and
mussels
cooked
with
parsley
a
procession
of
girls
went
in
to
get
hot
potatoes
wrapped
in
paper
and
cups
of
steaming
mussels
other
pretty
girls
bought
bunches
of
radishes
by
leaning
a
bit
gervaise
could
see
into
the
sausage
shop
from
which
children
issued
holding
a
fried
chop
a
sausage
or
a
piece
of
hot
blood
pudding
wrapped
in
greasy
paper
the
street
was
always
slick
with
black
mud
even
in
clear
weather
a
few
laborers
had
already
finished
their
lunch
and
were
strolling
aimlessly
about
their
open
hands
slapping
their
thighs
heavy
from
eating
slow
and
peaceful
amid
the
hurrying
crowd
a
group
formed
in
front
of
the
door
of
say
demanded
a
hoarse
voice
are
you
going
to
buy
us
a
round
of
five
laborers
came
in
and
stood
by
the
bar
ah
here
that
thief
pere
colombe
the
voice
continued
we
want
the
real
old
stuff
you
know
and
full
sized
glasses
too
pere
colombe
served
them
as
three
more
laborers
entered
more
blue
smocks
gathered
on
the
street
corner
and
some
pushed
their
way
into
the
establishment
you
foolish
you
only
think
of
the
present
gervaise
was
saying
to
coupeau
sure
i
loved
him
but
after
the
disgusting
way
in
which
he
left
me
they
were
talking
of
lantier
gervaise
had
not
seen
him
again
she
thought
he
was
living
with
virginie
sister
at
la
glaciere
in
the
house
of
that
friend
who
was
going
to
start
a
hat
factory
she
had
no
thought
of
running
after
him
she
had
been
so
distressed
at
first
that
she
had
thought
of
drowning
herself
in
the
river
but
now
that
she
had
thought
about
it
everything
seemed
to
be
for
the
best
lantier
went
through
money
so
fast
that
she
probably
never
could
have
raised
her
children
properly
oh
she
let
him
see
his
children
all
right
if
he
bothered
to
come
round
but
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
she
did
want
him
to
touch
her
not
even
with
his
finger
tips
she
told
all
this
to
coupeau
just
as
if
her
plan
of
life
was
well
settled
meanwhile
coupeau
never
forgot
his
desire
to
possess
her
he
made
a
jest
of
everything
she
said
turning
it
into
ribaldry
and
asking
some
very
direct
questions
about
lantier
but
he
proceeded
so
gaily
and
which
such
a
smile
that
she
never
thought
of
being
offended
so
you
the
one
who
beat
him
said
he
at
length
oh
you
not
kind
you
just
go
around
whipping
people
she
interrupted
him
with
a
hearty
laugh
it
was
true
though
she
had
whipped
virginie
tall
carcass
she
would
have
delighted
in
strangling
someone
on
that
day
she
laughed
louder
than
ever
when
coupeau
told
her
that
virginie
ashamed
at
having
shown
so
much
cowardice
had
left
the
neighborhood
her
face
however
preserved
an
expression
of
childish
gentleness
as
she
put
out
her
plump
hands
insisting
she
would
even
harm
a
fly
she
began
to
tell
coupeau
about
her
childhood
at
plassans
she
had
never
cared
overmuch
for
men
they
had
always
bored
her
she
was
fourteen
when
she
got
involved
with
lantier
she
had
thought
it
was
nice
because
he
said
he
was
her
husband
and
she
had
enjoyed
playing
a
housewife
she
was
too
and
too
weak
she
always
got
passionately
fond
of
people
who
caused
her
trouble
later
when
she
loved
a
man
she
thinking
of
having
fun
in
the
present
she
was
dreaming
about
being
happy
and
living
together
forever
and
as
coupeau
with
a
chuckle
spoke
of
her
two
children
saying
they
had
come
from
under
a
bolster
she
slapped
his
fingers
she
added
that
she
was
no
doubt
made
on
the
model
of
other
women
women
thought
of
their
home
slaved
to
keep
the
place
clean
and
tidy
and
went
to
bed
too
tired
at
night
not
to
go
to
sleep
at
once
besides
she
resembled
her
mother
a
stout
laboring
woman
who
died
at
her
work
and
who
had
served
as
beast
of
burden
to
old
macquart
for
more
than
twenty
years
her
mother
shoulders
had
been
heavy
enough
to
smash
through
doors
but
that
did
prevent
her
from
being
and
madly
attracted
to
people
and
if
she
limped
a
little
she
no
doubt
owed
that
to
the
poor
woman
whom
old
macquart
used
to
belabor
with
blows
her
mother
had
told
her
about
the
times
when
macquart
came
home
drunk
and
brutally
bruised
her
she
had
probably
been
born
with
her
lame
leg
as
a
result
of
one
of
those
times
oh
it
scarcely
anything
it
hardly
perceptible
said
coupeau
gallantly
she
shook
her
head
she
knew
well
enough
that
it
could
be
seen
at
forty
she
would
look
broken
in
two
then
she
added
gently
with
a
slight
laugh
it
a
funny
fancy
of
yours
to
fall
in
love
with
a
cripple
with
his
elbows
still
on
the
table
he
thrust
his
face
closer
to
hers
and
began
complimenting
her
in
rather
dubious
language
as
though
to
intoxicate
her
with
his
words
but
she
kept
shaking
her
head
no
and
did
allow
herself
to
be
tempted
although
she
was
flattered
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
while
listening
she
kept
looking
out
the
window
seeming
to
be
fascinated
by
the
interesting
crowd
of
people
passing
the
shops
were
now
almost
empty
the
grocer
removed
his
last
panful
of
fried
potatoes
from
the
stove
the
sausage
man
arranged
the
dishes
scattered
on
his
counter
great
bearded
workmen
were
as
playful
as
young
boys
clumping
along
in
their
hobnailed
boots
other
workmen
were
smoking
staring
up
into
the
sky
and
blinking
their
eyes
factory
bells
began
to
ring
in
the
distance
but
the
workers
in
no
hurry
relit
their
pipes
later
after
being
tempted
by
one
wineshop
after
another
they
finally
decided
to
return
to
their
jobs
but
were
still
dragging
their
feet
gervaise
amused
herself
by
watching
three
workmen
a
tall
fellow
and
two
short
ones
who
turned
to
look
back
every
few
yards
they
ended
by
descending
the
street
and
came
straight
to
pere
colombe
ah
well
murmured
she
there
three
fellows
who
do
seem
inclined
for
work
why
said
coupeau
i
know
the
tall
one
it
a
comrade
of
mine
pere
colombe
was
now
full
you
had
to
shout
to
be
heard
fists
often
pounded
on
the
bar
causing
the
glasses
to
clink
everyone
was
standing
hands
crossed
over
belly
or
held
behind
back
the
drinking
groups
crowded
close
to
one
another
some
groups
by
the
casks
had
to
wait
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
being
able
to
order
their
drinks
of
pere
colombe
hallo
it
that
aristocrat
young
cassis
cried
bringing
his
hand
down
roughly
on
coupeau
shoulder
a
fine
gentleman
who
smokes
paper
and
wears
shirts
so
we
want
to
do
the
grand
with
our
sweetheart
we
stand
her
little
treats
shut
up
do
bother
me
replied
coupeau
greatly
annoyed
but
the
other
added
with
a
chuckle
right
you
are
we
know
what
my
boy
muffs
are
muffs
that
all
he
turned
his
back
after
leering
terribly
as
he
looked
at
gervaise
the
latter
drew
back
feeling
rather
frightened
the
smoke
from
the
pipes
the
strong
odor
of
all
those
men
ascended
in
the
air
already
foul
with
the
fumes
of
alcohol
and
she
felt
a
choking
sensation
in
her
throat
and
coughed
slightly
oh
what
a
horrible
thing
it
is
to
drink
said
she
in
a
low
voice
and
she
related
that
formerly
at
plassans
she
used
to
drink
anisette
with
her
mother
but
on
one
occasion
it
nearly
killed
her
and
that
disgusted
her
with
it
now
she
could
never
touch
any
liqueurs
you
see
added
she
pointing
to
her
glass
i
eaten
my
plum
only
i
must
leave
the
juice
because
it
would
make
me
for
himself
coupeau
could
understand
how
anyone
could
drink
glass
after
glass
of
cheap
brandy
a
brandied
plum
occasionally
could
not
hurt
but
as
for
cheap
brandy
absinthe
and
the
other
strong
stuff
no
not
for
him
no
matter
how
much
his
comrades
teased
him
about
it
he
stayed
out
on
the
sidewalk
when
his
friends
went
into
low
establishments
coupeau
father
had
smashed
his
head
open
one
day
when
he
fell
from
the
eaves
of
no
on
rue
coquenard
he
was
drunk
this
memory
keeps
coupeau
entire
family
from
the
drink
every
time
coupeau
passed
that
spot
he
thought
he
would
rather
lick
up
water
from
the
gutter
than
accept
a
free
drink
in
a
bar
he
would
always
say
in
our
trade
you
have
to
have
steady
legs
gervaise
had
taken
up
her
basket
again
she
did
not
rise
from
her
seat
however
but
held
the
basket
on
her
knees
with
a
vacant
look
in
her
eyes
and
lost
in
thought
as
though
the
young
workman
words
had
awakened
within
her
thoughts
of
existence
and
she
said
again
slowly
and
without
any
apparent
change
of
manner
i
not
ambitious
i
do
ask
for
much
my
desire
is
to
work
in
peace
always
to
have
bread
to
eat
and
a
decent
place
to
sleep
in
you
know
with
a
bed
a
table
and
two
chairs
nothing
more
if
i
can
i
like
to
raise
my
children
to
be
good
citizens
also
i
like
not
to
be
beaten
up
if
i
ever
again
live
with
a
man
it
not
my
idea
of
amusement
she
pondered
thinking
if
there
was
anything
else
she
wanted
but
there
was
anything
of
importance
then
after
a
moment
she
went
on
yes
when
one
reaches
the
end
one
might
wish
to
die
in
one
bed
for
myself
having
trudged
through
life
i
should
like
to
die
in
my
bed
in
my
own
home
and
she
rose
from
her
seat
coupeau
who
cordially
approved
her
wishes
was
already
standing
up
anxious
about
the
time
but
they
did
not
leave
yet
gervaise
was
curious
enough
to
go
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
for
a
look
at
the
big
still
behind
the
oak
railing
it
was
chugging
away
in
the
little
courtyard
coupeau
explained
its
workings
to
her
pointing
at
the
different
parts
of
the
machinery
showing
her
the
trickling
of
the
small
stream
of
limpid
alcohol
not
a
single
gay
puff
of
steam
was
coming
forth
from
the
endless
coils
the
breathing
could
barely
be
heard
it
sounded
muffled
as
if
from
underground
it
was
like
a
sombre
worker
performing
dark
deeds
in
the
bright
daylight
strong
but
silent
accompanied
by
his
two
comrades
came
to
lean
on
the
railing
until
they
could
get
a
place
at
the
bar
he
laughed
looking
at
the
machine
de
that
clever
there
enough
stuff
in
its
big
belly
to
last
for
weeks
he
would
mind
if
they
just
fixed
the
end
of
the
tube
in
his
mouth
so
he
could
feel
the
fiery
spirits
flowing
down
to
his
heels
like
a
river
it
would
be
better
than
the
tiny
sips
doled
out
by
pere
colombe
his
two
comrades
laughed
with
him
saying
that
was
quite
a
guy
after
all
the
huge
still
continued
to
trickle
forth
its
alcoholic
sweat
eventually
it
would
invade
the
bar
flow
out
along
the
outer
boulevards
and
inundate
the
immense
expanse
of
paris
gervaise
stepped
back
shivering
she
tried
to
smile
as
she
said
it
foolish
but
that
still
and
the
liquor
gives
me
the
creeps
then
returning
to
the
idea
she
nursed
of
a
perfect
happiness
she
resumed
now
ai
i
right
it
much
the
nicest
is
it
to
have
plenty
of
work
bread
to
eat
a
home
of
one
own
and
to
be
able
to
bring
up
one
children
and
to
die
in
one
bed
and
never
to
be
beaten
added
coupeau
gaily
but
i
would
never
beat
you
if
you
would
only
try
me
madame
gervaise
you
no
cause
for
fear
i
do
drink
and
then
i
love
you
too
much
come
shall
it
be
marriage
i
get
you
divorced
and
make
you
my
wife
he
was
speaking
low
whispering
at
the
back
of
her
neck
while
she
made
her
way
through
the
crowd
of
men
with
her
basket
held
before
her
she
kept
shaking
her
head
no
yet
she
turned
around
to
smile
at
him
apparently
happy
to
know
that
he
never
drank
yes
certainly
she
would
say
yes
to
him
except
she
had
already
sworn
to
herself
never
to
start
up
with
another
man
eventually
they
reached
the
door
and
went
out
when
they
left
was
packed
to
the
door
spilling
its
hubbub
of
rough
voices
and
its
heavy
smell
of
vitriol
into
the
street
could
be
heard
railing
at
pere
colombe
calling
him
a
scoundrel
and
accusing
him
of
only
half
filling
his
glass
he
did
have
to
come
in
here
he
never
come
back
he
suggested
to
his
comrades
a
place
near
the
barriere
where
you
drank
good
stuff
straight
ah
sighed
gervaise
when
they
reached
the
sidewalk
you
can
breathe
out
here
monsieur
coupeau
and
thank
you
i
must
hurry
now
he
seized
her
hand
as
she
started
along
the
boulevard
insisting
take
a
walk
with
me
along
rue
de
la
it
not
much
farther
for
you
i
got
to
see
my
sister
before
going
back
to
work
we
keep
each
other
company
in
the
end
gervaise
agreed
and
they
walked
beside
each
other
along
the
rue
des
poissonniers
although
she
did
not
take
his
arm
he
told
her
about
his
family
his
mother
an
old
now
had
to
do
housekeeping
because
her
eyesight
was
poor
her
birthday
was
the
third
of
last
month
and
she
was
he
was
the
youngest
one
of
his
sisters
a
widow
of
worked
in
a
flower
shop
and
lived
in
the
batignolles
section
on
rue
des
moines
the
other
sister
was
thirty
years
old
now
she
had
married
a
deadpan
chainmaker
named
lorilleux
that
where
he
was
going
now
they
lived
in
a
big
tenement
on
the
left
side
he
ate
with
them
in
the
evenings
it
saved
a
bit
for
all
of
them
but
he
had
been
invited
out
this
evening
and
he
was
going
to
tell
her
not
to
expect
him
gervaise
who
was
listening
to
him
suddenly
interrupted
him
to
ask
with
a
smile
so
you
called
cassis
monsieur
coupeau
oh
replied
he
it
a
nickname
my
mates
have
given
me
because
i
generally
drink
when
they
force
me
to
accompany
them
to
the
wineshop
it
no
worse
to
be
called
young
cassis
than
is
it
of
course
not
young
cassis
is
an
ugly
name
observed
the
young
woman
and
she
questioned
him
about
his
work
he
was
still
working
there
behind
the
octroi
wall
at
the
new
hospital
oh
there
was
no
want
of
work
he
would
not
be
finished
there
for
a
year
at
least
there
were
yards
and
yards
of
gutters
you
know
said
he
i
can
see
the
hotel
boncoeur
when
i
up
there
yesterday
you
were
at
the
window
and
i
waved
my
arms
but
you
notice
me
they
had
already
gone
about
a
hundred
paces
along
the
rue
de
la
when
he
stood
still
and
raising
his
eyes
said
that
the
house
i
was
born
farther
on
at
no
but
this
house
is
all
the
same
a
fine
block
of
masonry
it
as
big
as
a
barrack
inside
gervaise
looked
up
examining
the
facade
on
the
street
side
the
tenement
had
five
stories
each
with
fifteen
windows
whose
black
shutters
with
their
broken
slats
gave
an
air
of
desolation
to
the
wide
expanse
of
wall
four
shops
occupied
the
ground
floor
to
the
right
of
the
entrance
a
large
greasy
hash
house
and
to
the
left
a
coal
dealer
a
notions
seller
and
an
umbrella
merchant
the
building
appeared
even
larger
than
it
was
because
it
had
on
each
side
a
small
low
building
which
seemed
to
lean
against
it
for
support
this
immense
building
was
outlined
against
the
sky
its
unplastered
side
walls
were
as
bare
as
prison
walls
except
for
rows
of
roughly
jutting
stones
which
suggested
jaws
full
of
decayed
teeth
yawning
vacantly
gervaise
was
gazing
at
the
entrance
with
interest
the
high
arched
doorway
rose
to
the
second
floor
and
opened
onto
a
deep
porch
at
the
end
of
which
could
be
seen
the
pale
daylight
of
a
courtyard
this
entranceway
was
paved
like
the
street
and
down
the
center
flowed
a
streamlet
of
water
come
in
said
coupeau
no
one
will
eat
you
gervaise
wanted
to
wait
for
him
in
the
street
however
she
could
not
resist
going
through
the
porch
as
far
as
the
concierge
room
on
the
right
and
there
on
the
threshold
she
raised
her
eyes
inside
the
building
was
six
stories
high
with
four
identical
plain
walls
enclosing
the
broad
central
court
the
drab
walls
were
corroded
by
yellowish
spots
and
streaked
by
drippings
from
the
roof
gutters
the
walls
went
straight
up
to
the
eaves
with
no
molding
or
ornament
except
the
angles
on
the
drain
pipes
at
each
floor
here
the
sink
drains
added
their
stains
the
glass
window
panes
resembled
murky
water
mattresses
of
checkered
blue
ticking
were
hanging
out
of
several
windows
to
air
clothes
lines
stretched
from
other
windows
with
family
washing
hanging
to
dry
on
a
third
floor
line
was
a
baby
diaper
still
implanted
with
filth
this
crowded
tenement
was
bursting
at
the
seams
spilling
out
poverty
and
misery
through
every
crevice
each
of
the
four
walls
had
at
ground
level
a
narrow
entrance
plastered
without
a
trace
of
woodwork
this
opened
into
a
vestibule
containing
a
staircase
which
spiraled
upward
they
were
each
labeled
with
one
of
the
first
four
letters
of
the
alphabet
painted
on
the
wall
several
large
with
skylights
were
scattered
about
the
court
near
the
concierge
room
was
the
dyeing
establishment
responsible
for
the
pink
streamlet
puddles
of
water
infested
the
courtyard
along
with
wood
shavings
and
coal
cinders
grass
and
weeds
grew
between
the
paving
stones
the
unforgiving
sunlight
seemed
to
cut
the
court
into
two
parts
on
the
shady
side
was
a
dripping
water
tap
with
three
small
hens
scratching
for
worms
with
their
claws
gervaise
slowly
gazed
about
lowering
her
glance
from
the
sixth
floor
to
the
paving
stones
then
raising
it
again
surprised
at
the
vastness
feeling
as
it
were
in
the
midst
of
a
living
organ
in
the
very
heart
of
a
city
and
interested
in
the
house
as
though
it
were
a
giant
before
her
is
madame
seeking
for
any
one
called
out
the
inquisitive
concierge
emerging
from
her
room
the
young
woman
explained
that
she
was
waiting
for
a
friend
she
returned
to
the
street
then
as
coupeau
did
not
come
she
went
back
to
the
courtyard
seized
with
the
desire
to
take
another
look
she
did
not
think
the
house
ugly
amongst
the
rags
hanging
from
the
windows
she
discovered
various
cheerful
touches
a
blooming
in
a
pot
a
cage
of
chirruping
canaries
shining
like
stars
in
the
depth
of
the
shadow
a
carpenter
was
singing
in
his
accompanied
by
the
whining
of
his
plane
the
blacksmith
hammers
were
ringing
rhythmically
in
contrast
to
the
apparent
wretched
poverty
at
nearly
every
open
window
appeared
the
begrimed
faces
of
laughing
children
women
with
peaceful
faces
could
be
seen
bent
over
their
sewing
the
rooms
were
empty
of
men
who
had
gone
back
to
work
after
lunch
the
whole
tenement
was
tranquil
except
for
the
sounds
from
the
below
which
served
as
a
sort
of
lullaby
that
went
on
unceasingly
always
the
same
the
only
thing
she
did
not
like
was
the
courtyard
dampness
she
would
want
rooms
at
the
rear
on
the
sunny
side
gervaise
took
a
few
more
steps
into
the
courtyard
inhaling
the
characteristic
odor
of
the
slums
comprised
of
dust
and
rotten
garbage
but
the
sharp
odor
of
the
waste
water
from
the
dye
shop
was
strong
and
gervaise
thought
it
smelled
better
here
than
at
the
hotel
boncoeur
she
chose
a
window
for
herself
the
one
at
the
far
left
with
a
small
window
box
planted
with
scarlet
runners
i
afraid
i
kept
you
waiting
rather
a
long
time
said
coupeau
whom
she
suddenly
heard
close
beside
her
they
always
make
an
awful
fuss
whenever
i
do
dine
with
them
and
it
was
worse
than
ever
as
my
sister
had
bought
some
veal
and
as
gervaise
had
slightly
started
with
surprise
he
continued
glancing
around
in
his
turn
you
were
looking
at
the
house
it
always
all
let
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
there
are
three
hundred
lodgers
i
think
if
i
had
any
furniture
i
would
have
secured
a
small
room
one
would
be
comfortable
here
do
you
think
so
yes
one
would
be
comfortable
murmured
gervaise
in
our
street
at
plassans
there
were
near
so
many
people
look
that
pretty
that
window
up
on
the
fifth
floor
with
the
scarlet
runners
the
obstinate
desire
made
him
ask
her
once
more
whether
she
would
or
she
would
they
could
rent
a
place
here
as
soon
as
they
found
a
bed
she
hurried
out
the
arched
entranceway
asking
him
not
to
start
that
subject
again
there
was
as
much
chance
of
this
building
collapsing
as
there
was
of
her
sleeping
under
the
same
blanket
with
him
still
when
coupeau
left
her
in
front
of
madame
fauconnier
shop
he
was
allowed
to
hold
her
hand
for
a
moment
for
a
month
the
young
woman
and
the
were
the
best
of
friends
he
admired
her
courage
when
he
beheld
her
half
killing
herself
with
work
keeping
her
children
tidy
and
clean
and
yet
finding
time
at
night
to
do
a
little
sewing
often
other
women
were
hopelessly
messy
forever
nibbling
or
gadding
about
but
she
was
like
them
at
all
she
was
much
too
serious
then
she
would
laugh
and
modestly
defend
herself
it
was
her
misfortune
that
she
had
not
always
been
good
having
been
with
a
man
when
only
fourteen
then
too
she
had
often
helped
her
mother
empty
a
bottle
of
anisette
but
she
had
learned
a
few
things
from
experience
he
was
wrong
to
think
of
her
as
her
will
power
was
very
weak
she
had
always
let
herself
be
pushed
into
things
because
she
did
want
to
hurt
someone
feelings
her
one
hope
now
was
to
live
among
decent
people
for
living
among
bad
people
was
like
being
hit
over
the
head
it
cracks
your
skull
whenever
she
thought
of
the
future
she
shivered
everything
she
had
seen
in
life
so
far
especially
when
a
child
had
given
her
lessons
to
remember
coupeau
however
chaffed
her
about
her
gloomy
thoughts
and
brought
back
all
her
courage
by
trying
to
pinch
her
hips
she
pushed
him
away
from
her
and
slapped
his
hands
whilst
he
called
out
laughingly
that
for
a
weak
woman
she
was
not
a
very
easy
capture
he
who
always
joked
about
everything
did
not
trouble
himself
regarding
the
future
one
day
followed
another
that
was
all
there
would
always
be
somewhere
to
sleep
and
a
bite
to
eat
the
neighborhood
seemed
decent
enough
to
him
except
for
a
gang
of
drunkards
that
ought
to
be
cleaned
out
of
the
gutters
coupeau
was
not
a
bad
sort
of
fellow
he
sometimes
had
really
sensible
things
to
say
he
was
something
of
a
dandy
with
his
parisian
working
man
gift
for
banter
a
regular
gift
of
gab
and
besides
he
was
attractive
they
had
ended
by
rendering
each
other
all
sorts
of
services
at
the
hotel
boncoeur
coupeau
fetched
her
milk
ran
her
errands
carried
her
bundles
of
clothes
often
of
an
evening
as
he
got
home
first
from
work
he
took
the
children
for
a
walk
on
the
exterior
boulevard
gervaise
in
return
for
his
polite
attentions
would
go
up
into
the
narrow
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
where
he
slept
and
see
to
his
clothes
sewing
buttons
on
his
blue
linen
trousers
and
mending
his
linen
jackets
a
great
familiarity
existed
between
them
she
was
never
bored
when
he
was
around
the
gay
songs
he
sang
amused
her
and
so
did
his
continuous
banter
of
jokes
and
jibes
characteristic
of
the
paris
streets
this
being
still
new
to
her
on
coupeau
side
this
continual
familiarity
inflamed
him
more
and
more
until
it
began
to
seriously
bother
him
he
began
to
feel
tense
and
uneasy
he
continued
with
his
foolish
talk
never
failing
to
ask
her
when
will
it
be
she
understood
what
he
meant
and
teased
him
he
would
then
come
to
visit
her
carrying
his
bedroom
slippers
as
if
he
were
moving
in
she
joked
about
it
and
continued
calmly
without
blushing
at
the
allusions
with
which
he
was
always
surrounding
her
she
stood
for
anything
from
him
as
long
as
he
did
get
rough
she
only
got
angry
once
when
he
pulled
a
strand
of
her
hair
while
trying
to
force
a
kiss
from
her
towards
the
end
of
june
coupeau
lost
his
liveliness
he
became
most
peculiar
gervaise
feeling
uneasy
at
some
of
his
glances
barricaded
herself
in
at
night
then
after
having
sulked
ever
since
the
sunday
he
suddenly
came
on
the
tuesday
night
about
eleven
and
knocked
at
her
room
she
would
not
open
to
him
but
his
voice
was
so
gentle
and
so
trembling
that
she
ended
by
removing
the
chest
of
drawers
she
had
pushed
against
the
door
when
he
entered
she
thought
he
was
ill
he
looked
so
pale
his
eyes
were
so
red
and
the
veins
on
his
face
were
all
swollen
and
he
stood
there
stuttering
and
shaking
his
head
no
no
he
was
not
ill
he
had
been
crying
for
two
hours
upstairs
in
his
room
he
wept
like
a
child
biting
his
pillow
so
as
not
to
be
heard
by
the
neighbors
for
three
nights
past
he
had
been
unable
to
sleep
it
could
not
go
on
like
that
listen
madame
gervaise
said
he
with
a
swelling
in
his
throat
and
on
the
point
of
bursting
out
crying
again
we
must
end
this
must
we
we
go
and
get
married
it
what
i
want
i
quite
made
up
my
mind
gervaise
showed
great
surprise
she
was
very
grave
oh
monsieur
coupeau
murmured
she
whatever
are
you
thinking
of
you
know
i
never
asked
you
for
that
i
did
care
about
it
that
was
all
oh
no
no
it
serious
now
think
of
what
you
saying
i
beg
of
you
but
he
continued
to
shake
his
head
with
an
air
of
unalterable
resolution
he
had
already
thought
it
all
over
he
had
come
down
because
he
wanted
to
have
a
good
night
she
was
going
to
send
him
back
to
weep
again
he
supposed
as
soon
as
she
said
yes
he
would
no
longer
bother
her
and
she
could
go
quietly
to
bed
he
only
wanted
to
hear
her
say
yes
they
could
talk
it
over
on
the
morrow
but
i
certainly
ca
say
just
like
that
resumed
gervaise
i
do
want
you
to
be
able
to
accuse
me
later
on
of
having
incited
you
to
do
a
foolish
thing
you
should
be
so
insistent
monsieur
coupeau
you
ca
really
be
sure
that
you
in
love
with
me
if
you
did
see
me
for
a
week
it
might
fade
away
sometimes
men
get
married
and
then
there
day
after
day
stretching
out
into
an
entire
lifetime
and
they
get
pretty
well
bored
by
it
all
sit
down
there
i
willing
to
talk
it
over
at
once
then
until
one
in
the
morning
in
the
dark
room
and
by
the
faint
light
of
a
smoky
tallow
candle
which
they
forgot
to
snuff
they
talked
of
their
marriage
lowering
their
voices
so
as
not
to
wake
the
two
children
claude
and
etienne
who
were
sleeping
both
heads
on
the
same
pillow
gervaise
kept
pointing
out
the
children
to
coupeau
what
a
funny
kind
of
dowry
they
were
she
really
should
burden
him
with
them
besides
what
would
the
neighbors
say
she
feel
ashamed
for
him
because
everyone
knew
about
the
story
of
her
life
and
her
lover
they
would
think
it
decent
if
they
saw
them
getting
married
barely
two
months
later
coupeau
replied
by
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
did
care
about
the
neighbors
he
never
bothered
about
their
affairs
so
there
was
lantier
before
him
well
so
what
what
so
bad
about
that
she
had
been
constantly
bringing
men
upstairs
as
some
women
did
even
rich
ladies
the
children
would
grow
up
they
raise
them
right
never
had
he
known
before
such
a
woman
such
sound
character
so
anyway
she
could
have
been
anything
a
streetwalker
ugly
lazy
and
with
a
whole
gang
of
dirty
kids
and
so
what
he
wanted
her
yes
i
want
you
he
repeated
bringing
his
hand
down
on
his
knee
with
a
continuos
hammering
you
understand
i
want
you
there
nothing
to
be
said
to
that
is
there
little
by
little
gervaise
gave
way
her
emotions
began
to
take
control
when
faced
with
his
encompassing
desire
still
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
her
face
suffused
with
a
soft
sweetness
she
hesitantly
offered
objections
from
outside
through
the
window
a
lovely
june
night
breathed
in
puffs
of
sultry
air
disturbing
the
candle
with
its
long
wick
gleaming
red
like
a
glowing
coal
in
the
deep
silence
of
the
sleeping
neighborhood
the
only
sound
was
the
infantile
weeping
of
a
drunkard
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
street
far
away
in
the
back
room
of
some
restaurant
a
violin
was
playing
a
dance
tune
for
some
late
party
coupeau
was
silent
then
knowing
she
had
no
more
arguments
he
smiled
took
hold
of
her
hands
and
pulled
her
toward
him
she
was
in
one
of
those
moments
of
weakness
she
so
greatly
mistrusted
persuaded
at
last
too
emotionally
stirred
to
refuse
anything
or
to
hurt
anyone
feelings
coupeau
did
realize
that
she
was
giving
way
he
held
her
wrists
so
tightly
as
to
almost
crush
them
together
they
breathed
a
long
sigh
that
to
both
of
them
meant
a
partial
satisfaction
of
their
desire
you
say
wo
you
asked
he
how
you
worry
me
she
murmured
you
wish
it
well
then
ah
we
perhaps
doing
a
very
foolish
thing
he
jumped
up
and
seizing
her
round
the
waist
kissed
her
roughly
on
the
face
at
random
then
as
this
caress
caused
a
noise
he
became
anxious
and
went
softly
and
looked
at
claude
and
etienne
hush
we
must
be
careful
said
he
in
a
whisper
and
not
wake
the
children
till
and
he
went
back
to
his
room
gervaise
all
in
a
tremble
remained
seated
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
without
thinking
of
undressing
herself
for
nearly
an
hour
she
was
touched
she
felt
that
coupeau
was
very
honorable
for
at
one
moment
she
had
really
thought
it
was
all
over
and
that
he
would
forget
her
the
drunkard
below
under
the
window
was
now
hoarsely
uttering
the
plaintive
cry
of
some
lost
animal
the
violin
in
the
distance
had
left
off
its
saucy
tune
and
was
now
silent
during
the
following
days
coupeau
sought
to
get
gervaise
to
call
some
evening
on
his
sister
in
the
rue
de
la
but
the
young
woman
who
was
very
timid
showed
a
great
dread
of
this
visit
to
the
lorilleux
she
knew
that
coupeau
had
a
lingering
fear
of
that
household
even
though
he
certainly
was
dependent
on
his
sister
who
was
even
the
oldest
of
the
family
mamma
coupeau
would
certainly
give
her
consent
at
once
as
she
never
refused
her
only
son
anything
the
thing
was
that
the
lorilleuxs
were
supposed
to
be
earning
ten
francs
a
day
or
more
and
that
gave
them
a
certain
authority
coupeau
would
never
dare
to
get
married
unless
his
wife
was
acceptable
to
them
i
have
spoken
to
them
of
you
they
know
our
plans
explained
he
to
gervaise
come
now
what
a
child
you
are
let
call
on
them
this
evening
i
warned
you
have
i
you
find
my
sister
rather
stiff
lorilleux
too
is
always
very
amiable
in
reality
they
are
greatly
annoyed
because
if
i
marry
i
shall
no
longer
take
my
meals
with
them
and
it
be
an
economy
the
less
but
that
does
matter
they
turn
you
out
do
this
for
me
it
absolutely
necessary
these
words
only
frightened
gervaise
the
more
one
saturday
evening
however
she
gave
in
coupeau
came
for
her
at
eight
she
had
dressed
herself
in
a
black
dress
a
crape
shawl
with
yellow
palms
and
a
white
cap
trimmed
with
a
little
cheap
lace
during
the
six
weeks
she
had
been
working
she
had
saved
the
seven
francs
for
the
shawl
and
the
two
and
a
half
francs
for
the
cap
the
dress
was
an
old
one
cleaned
and
made
up
afresh
they
expecting
you
said
coupeau
to
her
as
they
went
round
by
the
rue
des
poissonniers
oh
they
beginning
to
get
used
to
the
idea
of
my
being
married
they
seem
nice
indeed
and
you
know
if
you
never
seen
gold
chains
made
it
amuse
you
to
watch
them
they
just
happen
to
have
a
pressing
order
for
monday
they
got
gold
in
their
room
asked
gervaise
i
should
think
so
there
some
on
the
walls
on
the
floor
in
fact
everywhere
they
had
passed
the
arched
doorway
and
crossed
the
courtyard
the
lorilleuxs
lived
on
the
sixth
floor
staircase
coupeau
laughingly
told
her
to
hold
the
tight
and
not
to
leave
go
of
it
she
looked
up
and
blinked
her
eyes
as
she
perceived
the
tall
hollow
tower
of
the
staircase
lighted
by
three
gas
jets
one
on
every
second
landing
the
last
one
right
up
at
the
top
looked
like
a
star
twinkling
in
a
black
sky
whilst
the
other
two
cast
long
flashes
of
light
of
fantastic
shapes
among
the
interminable
windings
of
the
stairs
by
jove
said
the
as
he
reached
the
first
floor
smiling
there
a
strong
smell
of
onion
soup
someone
having
onion
soup
sure
staircase
b
with
its
gray
dirty
steps
and
its
scratched
walls
and
chipped
plaster
was
full
of
strong
kitchen
odors
long
corridors
echoing
with
noise
led
away
from
each
landing
doors
painted
yellow
gaped
open
smeared
black
around
the
latch
from
dirty
hands
a
sink
on
each
landing
gave
forth
a
fetid
humidity
adding
its
stench
to
the
sharp
flavor
of
the
cooking
of
onions
from
the
basement
all
the
way
to
the
sixth
floor
you
could
hear
dishes
clattering
saucepans
being
rinsed
pots
being
scraped
and
scoured
on
the
first
floor
gervaise
saw
a
door
with
the
word
designer
written
on
it
in
large
letters
inside
were
two
men
sitting
by
a
table
the
dishes
cleared
away
from
its
oilcloth
cover
arguing
furiously
amid
a
cloud
of
pipe
smoke
the
second
and
third
floors
were
quieter
and
through
cracks
in
the
woodwork
only
such
sounds
filtered
as
the
rhythm
of
a
cradle
rocking
the
stifled
crying
of
a
child
a
voice
sounding
like
the
dull
murmur
of
running
water
with
no
words
distinct
gervaise
read
the
various
signs
on
the
doors
giving
the
names
of
the
occupants
madame
gaudron
and
monsieur
madinier
cardboard
boxes
there
was
a
fight
in
progress
on
the
fourth
floor
a
stomping
of
feet
that
shook
the
floor
furniture
banged
around
a
racket
of
curses
and
blows
but
this
did
not
bother
the
neighbors
opposite
who
were
playing
cards
with
their
door
opened
wide
to
admit
more
air
when
gervaise
reached
the
fifth
floor
she
had
to
stop
to
take
a
breath
she
was
not
used
to
going
up
so
high
that
wall
for
ever
turning
the
glimpses
she
had
of
the
lodgings
following
each
other
made
her
head
ache
anyway
there
was
a
family
almost
blocking
the
landing
the
father
washing
the
dishes
over
a
small
earthenware
stove
near
the
sink
and
the
mother
sitting
with
her
back
to
the
and
cleaning
the
baby
before
putting
it
to
bed
coupeau
kept
urging
gervaise
along
and
they
finally
reached
the
sixth
floor
he
encouraged
her
with
a
smile
they
had
arrived
she
had
been
hearing
a
voice
all
the
way
up
from
the
bottom
and
she
was
gazing
upward
wondering
where
it
could
be
coming
from
a
voice
so
clear
and
piercing
that
it
had
dominated
all
the
other
sounds
it
came
from
a
little
old
woman
in
an
attic
room
who
sang
while
putting
dresses
on
cheap
dolls
when
a
tall
girl
came
by
with
a
pail
of
water
and
entered
a
nearby
apartment
gervaise
saw
a
tumbled
bed
on
which
a
man
was
sprawled
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
as
the
door
closed
behind
her
gervaise
saw
the
card
mademoiselle
clemence
ironing
now
that
she
had
finally
made
it
to
the
top
her
legs
weary
and
her
breath
short
gervaise
leaned
over
the
railing
to
look
down
now
it
was
the
gaslight
on
the
first
floor
which
seemed
a
distant
star
at
the
bottom
of
a
narrow
well
six
stories
deep
all
the
odors
and
all
the
murmurings
of
the
immense
variety
of
life
within
the
tenement
came
up
to
her
in
one
stifling
breath
that
flushed
her
face
as
she
hazarded
a
worried
glance
down
into
the
gulf
below
we
not
there
yet
said
coupeau
oh
it
quite
a
journey
he
had
gone
down
a
long
corridor
on
the
left
he
turned
twice
the
first
time
also
to
the
left
the
second
time
to
the
right
the
corridor
still
continued
branching
off
narrowing
between
walls
full
of
crevices
with
plaster
peeling
off
and
lighted
at
distant
intervals
by
a
slender
and
the
doors
all
alike
succeeded
each
other
the
same
as
the
doors
of
a
prison
or
a
convent
and
nearly
all
open
continued
to
display
homes
of
misery
and
work
which
the
hot
june
evening
filled
with
a
reddish
mist
at
length
they
reached
a
small
passage
in
complete
darkness
we
here
resumed
the
be
careful
keep
to
the
wall
there
are
three
steps
and
gervaise
carefully
took
another
ten
steps
in
the
obscurity
she
stumbled
and
then
counted
the
three
steps
but
at
the
end
of
the
passage
coupeau
had
opened
a
door
without
knocking
a
brilliant
light
spread
over
the
tiled
floor
they
entered
it
was
a
narrow
apartment
and
seemed
as
if
it
were
the
continuation
of
the
corridor
a
faded
woolen
curtain
raised
up
just
then
by
a
string
divided
the
place
in
two
the
first
part
contained
a
bedstead
pushed
beneath
an
angle
of
the
attic
ceiling
a
stove
still
warm
from
the
cooking
of
the
dinner
two
chairs
a
table
and
a
wardrobe
the
cornice
of
which
had
had
to
be
sawn
off
to
make
it
fit
in
between
the
door
and
the
bedstead
the
second
part
was
fitted
up
as
a
at
the
end
a
narrow
forge
with
its
bellows
to
the
right
a
vise
fixed
to
the
wall
beneath
some
shelves
on
which
pieces
of
old
iron
lay
scattered
to
the
left
near
the
window
a
small
workman
bench
encumbered
with
greasy
and
very
dirty
pliers
shears
and
microscopical
saws
all
very
dirty
and
grimy
it
us
cried
coupeau
advancing
as
far
as
the
woolen
curtain
but
no
one
answered
at
first
gervaise
deeply
affected
moved
especially
by
the
thought
that
she
was
about
to
enter
a
place
full
of
gold
stood
behind
the
stammering
and
venturing
upon
nods
of
her
head
by
way
of
bowing
the
brilliant
light
a
lamp
burning
on
the
bench
a
brazier
full
of
coals
flaring
in
the
forge
increased
her
confusion
still
more
she
ended
however
by
distinguishing
madame
lorilleux
little
and
tolerably
strong
pulling
with
all
the
strength
of
her
short
arms
and
with
the
assistance
of
a
big
pair
of
pincers
a
thread
of
black
metal
which
she
passed
through
the
holes
of
a
fixed
to
the
vise
seated
in
front
of
the
bench
lorilleux
quite
as
small
of
stature
but
more
slender
in
the
shoulders
worked
with
the
tips
of
his
pliers
with
the
vivacity
of
a
monkey
at
a
labor
so
minute
that
it
was
impossible
to
follow
it
between
his
scraggy
fingers
it
was
the
husband
who
first
raised
his
head
a
head
with
scanty
locks
the
face
of
the
yellow
tinge
of
old
wax
long
and
with
an
ailing
expression
ah
it
you
well
well
murmured
he
we
in
a
hurry
you
know
do
come
into
the
you
be
in
our
way
stay
in
the
bedroom
and
he
resumed
his
minute
task
his
face
again
in
the
reflection
of
a
glass
globe
full
of
water
through
which
the
lamp
shed
a
circle
of
bright
light
over
his
work
take
the
chairs
called
out
madame
lorilleux
in
her
turn
it
that
lady
is
it
very
well
very
well
she
had
rolled
the
wire
and
she
carried
it
to
the
forge
and
then
reviving
the
fire
of
the
brazier
with
a
large
wooden
fan
she
proceeded
to
temper
the
wire
before
passing
it
through
the
last
holes
of
the
coupeau
moved
the
chairs
forward
and
seated
gervaise
by
the
curtain
the
room
was
so
narrow
that
he
could
not
sit
beside
her
so
he
sat
behind
her
leaning
over
her
shoulder
to
explain
the
work
in
progress
gervaise
was
intimidated
by
this
strange
reception
and
felt
uneasy
she
had
a
buzzing
in
her
ears
and
could
hear
clearly
she
thought
the
wife
looked
older
than
her
thirty
years
and
not
very
neat
with
her
hair
in
a
pigtail
dangling
down
the
back
of
her
loosely
worn
wrapper
the
husband
who
was
only
a
year
older
appeared
already
an
old
man
with
mean
thin
lips
as
he
sat
there
working
in
his
shirt
sleeves
with
his
bare
feet
thrust
into
down
at
the
heel
slippers
gervaise
was
dismayed
by
the
smallness
of
the
shop
the
grimy
walls
the
rustiness
of
the
tools
and
the
black
soot
spread
all
over
what
looked
like
the
odds
and
ends
of
a
peddler
wares
and
the
gold
asked
gervaise
in
a
low
voice
her
anxious
glances
searched
the
corners
and
sought
amongst
all
that
filth
for
the
resplendence
she
had
dreamt
of
but
coupeau
burst
out
laughing
gold
said
he
why
there
some
there
some
more
and
there
some
at
your
feet
he
pointed
successively
to
the
fine
wire
at
which
his
sister
was
working
and
to
another
roll
of
wire
similar
to
the
ordinary
iron
wire
hanging
against
the
wall
close
to
the
vise
then
going
down
on
all
fours
he
picked
up
beneath
the
wooden
screen
which
covered
the
tiled
floor
of
the
a
piece
of
waste
a
tiny
fragment
resembling
the
point
of
a
rusty
needle
but
gervaise
protested
that
could
be
gold
that
blackish
piece
of
metal
as
ugly
as
iron
he
had
to
bite
into
the
piece
and
show
her
the
gleaming
notch
made
by
his
teeth
then
he
continued
his
explanations
the
employers
provided
the
gold
wire
already
alloyed
the
craftsmen
first
pulled
it
through
the
to
obtain
the
correct
size
being
careful
to
anneal
it
five
or
six
times
to
keep
it
from
breaking
it
required
a
steady
strong
hand
and
plenty
of
practice
his
sister
would
not
let
her
husband
touch
the
since
he
was
subject
to
coughing
spells
she
had
strong
arms
for
it
he
had
seen
her
draw
gold
to
the
fineness
of
a
hair
lorilleux
seized
with
a
fit
of
coughing
almost
doubled
up
on
his
stool
in
the
midst
of
the
paroxysm
he
spoke
and
said
in
a
choking
voice
still
without
looking
at
gervaise
as
though
he
was
merely
mentioning
the
thing
to
himself
i
making
the
chain
coupeau
urged
gervaise
to
get
up
she
might
draw
nearer
and
see
the
chainmaker
consented
with
a
grunt
he
wound
the
wire
prepared
by
his
wife
round
a
mandrel
a
very
thin
steel
rod
then
he
sawed
gently
cutting
the
wire
the
whole
length
of
the
mandrel
each
turn
forming
a
link
which
he
soldered
the
links
were
laid
on
a
large
piece
of
charcoal
he
wetted
them
with
a
drop
of
borax
taken
from
the
bottom
of
a
broken
glass
beside
him
and
he
made
them
at
the
lamp
beneath
the
horizontal
flame
produced
by
the
then
when
he
had
soldered
about
a
hundred
links
he
returned
once
more
to
his
minute
work
propping
his
hands
against
the
edge
of
the
a
small
piece
of
board
which
the
friction
of
his
hands
had
polished
he
bent
each
link
almost
double
with
the
pliers
squeezed
one
end
close
inserted
it
in
the
last
link
already
in
place
and
then
with
the
aid
of
a
point
opened
out
again
the
end
he
had
squeezed
and
he
did
this
with
a
continuous
regularity
the
links
joining
each
other
so
rapidly
that
the
chain
gradually
grew
beneath
gervaise
gaze
without
her
being
able
to
follow
or
well
understand
how
it
was
done
that
the
chain
said
coupeau
there
also
the
long
link
the
cable
the
plain
ring
and
the
spiral
but
that
the
lorilleux
only
makes
the
chain
the
latter
chuckled
with
satisfaction
he
exclaimed
as
he
continued
squeezing
the
links
invisible
between
his
black
listen
to
me
young
cassis
i
was
making
a
calculation
this
morning
i
commenced
work
when
i
was
twelve
years
old
you
know
well
can
you
guess
how
long
a
chain
i
must
have
made
up
till
he
raised
his
pale
face
and
blinked
his
red
thousand
feet
do
you
hear
two
leagues
that
something
a
chain
two
leagues
long
it
enough
to
twist
round
the
necks
of
all
the
women
of
the
neighborhood
and
you
know
it
still
increasing
i
hope
to
make
it
long
enough
to
reach
from
paris
to
versailles
gervaise
had
returned
to
her
seat
disenchanted
and
thinking
everything
very
ugly
she
smiled
to
be
polite
to
the
lorilleuxs
the
complete
silence
about
her
marriage
bothered
her
it
was
the
sole
reason
for
her
having
come
the
lorilleuxs
were
treating
her
as
some
stranger
brought
in
by
coupeau
when
a
conversation
finally
did
get
started
it
concerned
the
building
tenants
madame
lorilleux
asked
her
husband
if
he
had
heard
the
people
on
the
fourth
floor
having
a
fight
they
fought
every
day
the
husband
usually
came
home
drunk
and
the
wife
had
her
faults
too
yelling
in
the
filthiest
language
then
they
spoke
of
the
designer
on
the
first
floor
an
uppity
with
a
mound
of
debts
always
smoking
always
arguing
loudly
with
his
friends
monsieur
cardboard
business
was
barely
surviving
he
had
let
two
girl
workers
go
yesterday
the
business
ate
up
all
his
money
leaving
his
children
to
run
around
in
rags
and
that
madame
gaudron
was
pregnant
again
this
was
almost
indecent
at
her
age
the
landlord
was
going
to
evict
the
coquets
on
the
fifth
floor
they
owed
nine
months
rent
and
besides
they
insisted
on
lighting
their
stove
out
on
the
landing
last
saturday
the
old
lady
on
the
sixth
floor
mademoiselle
remanjou
had
arrived
just
in
time
to
save
the
linguerlot
child
from
being
badly
burned
mademoiselle
clemence
one
who
took
in
ironing
well
she
lived
life
as
she
pleased
she
was
so
kind
to
animals
though
and
had
such
a
good
heart
that
you
could
say
anything
against
her
it
was
a
pity
a
fine
girl
like
her
the
company
she
kept
she
be
walking
the
streets
before
long
look
here
one
said
lorilleux
to
his
wife
giving
her
the
piece
of
chain
he
had
been
working
on
since
his
lunch
you
can
trim
it
and
he
added
with
the
persistence
of
a
man
who
does
not
easily
relinquish
a
joke
another
four
feet
and
a
half
that
brings
me
nearer
to
versailles
madame
lorilleux
after
tempering
it
again
trimmed
it
by
passing
it
through
the
regulating
then
she
put
it
in
a
little
copper
saucepan
with
a
long
handle
full
of
and
placed
it
over
the
fire
of
the
forge
gervaise
again
pushed
forward
by
coupeau
had
to
follow
this
last
operation
when
the
chain
was
thoroughly
cleansed
it
appeared
a
dull
red
color
it
was
finished
and
ready
to
be
delivered
they
always
delivered
like
that
in
their
rough
state
the
explained
the
polishers
rub
them
afterwards
with
cloths
gervaise
felt
her
courage
failing
her
the
heat
more
and
more
intense
was
suffocating
her
they
kept
the
door
shut
because
lorilleux
caught
cold
from
the
least
draught
then
as
they
still
did
not
speak
of
the
marriage
she
wanted
to
go
away
and
gently
pulled
coupeau
jacket
he
understood
besides
he
also
was
beginning
to
feel
ill
at
ease
and
vexed
at
their
affectation
of
silence
well
we
off
said
he
we
must
keep
you
from
your
work
he
moved
about
for
a
moment
waiting
hoping
for
a
word
or
some
allusion
or
other
at
length
he
decided
to
broach
the
subject
himself
i
say
lorilleux
we
counting
on
you
to
be
my
wife
witness
the
chainmaker
pretended
with
a
chuckle
to
be
greatly
surprised
whilst
his
wife
leaving
her
placed
herself
in
the
middle
of
the
so
it
serious
then
murmured
he
that
confounded
young
cassis
one
never
knows
whether
he
is
joking
or
not
ah
yes
madame
the
person
involved
said
the
wife
in
her
turn
as
she
stared
rudely
at
gervaise
dieu
we
no
advice
to
give
you
we
have
it
a
funny
idea
to
go
and
get
married
all
the
same
anyhow
it
your
own
wish
when
it
does
succeed
one
only
got
oneself
to
blame
that
all
and
it
does
often
succeed
not
often
not
often
she
uttered
these
last
words
slower
and
slower
and
shaking
her
head
she
looked
from
the
young
woman
face
to
her
hands
and
then
to
her
feet
as
though
she
had
wished
to
undress
her
and
see
the
very
pores
of
her
skin
she
must
have
found
her
better
than
she
expected
my
brother
is
perfectly
free
she
continued
more
stiffly
no
doubt
the
family
might
have
wished
one
always
makes
projects
but
things
take
such
funny
turns
for
myself
i
do
want
to
have
any
unpleasantness
had
he
brought
us
the
lowest
of
the
low
i
should
merely
have
said
her
and
go
to
blazes
he
was
not
badly
off
though
here
with
us
he
fat
enough
one
can
very
well
see
he
did
fast
much
and
he
always
found
his
soup
hot
right
on
time
i
say
lorilleux
do
you
think
madame
like
therese
you
know
who
i
mean
that
woman
who
used
to
live
opposite
and
who
died
of
consumption
yes
there
a
certain
resemblance
replied
the
chainmaker
and
you
got
two
children
madame
now
i
must
admit
i
said
to
my
brother
ca
understand
how
you
can
want
to
marry
a
woman
who
got
two
children
you
must
be
offended
if
i
consult
his
interests
its
only
natural
you
do
look
strong
either
do
you
think
lorilleux
that
madame
does
look
very
strong
no
no
she
not
strong
they
did
not
mention
her
leg
but
gervaise
understood
by
their
side
glances
and
the
curling
of
their
lips
that
they
were
alluding
to
it
she
stood
before
them
wrapped
in
her
thin
shawl
with
the
yellow
palms
replying
in
monosyllables
as
though
in
the
presence
of
her
judges
coupeau
seeing
she
was
suffering
ended
by
exclaiming
all
that
nothing
to
do
with
it
what
you
are
talking
about
important
the
wedding
will
take
place
on
saturday
july
i
calculated
by
the
almanac
is
it
settled
does
it
suit
you
oh
it
all
the
same
to
us
said
his
sister
there
was
no
necessity
to
consult
us
i
sha
prevent
lorilleux
being
witness
i
only
want
peace
and
quiet
gervaise
hanging
her
head
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
herself
had
put
the
toe
of
her
boot
through
one
of
the
openings
in
the
wooden
screen
which
covered
the
tiled
floor
of
the
then
afraid
of
having
disturbed
something
when
she
had
withdrawn
it
she
stooped
down
and
felt
about
with
her
hand
lorilleux
hastily
brought
the
lamp
and
he
examined
her
fingers
suspiciously
you
must
be
careful
said
he
the
tiny
bits
of
gold
stick
to
the
shoes
and
get
carried
away
without
one
knowing
it
it
was
all
to
do
with
business
the
employers
did
allow
a
single
speck
for
waste
he
showed
her
the
rabbit
foot
he
used
to
brush
off
any
flecks
of
gold
left
on
the
and
the
leather
he
kept
on
his
lap
to
catch
any
gold
that
fell
twice
weekly
the
shop
was
swept
out
carefully
the
sweepings
collected
and
burned
and
the
ashes
sifted
this
recovered
up
to
or
thirty
francs
worth
of
gold
a
month
madame
lorilleux
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
gervaise
shoes
there
no
reason
to
get
angry
murmured
she
with
an
amiable
smile
but
perhaps
madame
would
not
mind
looking
at
the
soles
of
her
shoes
and
gervaise
turning
very
red
sat
down
again
and
holding
up
her
feet
showed
that
there
was
nothing
clinging
to
them
coupeau
had
opened
the
door
exclaiming
in
an
abrupt
tone
of
voice
he
called
to
her
from
the
corridor
then
she
in
her
turn
went
off
after
stammering
a
few
polite
words
she
hoped
to
see
them
again
and
that
they
would
all
agree
well
together
both
of
the
lorilleux
had
already
gone
back
to
their
work
at
the
far
end
of
their
dark
hole
of
a
madame
lorilleux
her
skin
reflecting
the
red
glow
from
the
bed
of
coals
was
drawing
on
another
wire
each
effort
swelling
her
neck
and
making
the
strained
muscles
stand
out
like
taut
cords
her
husband
hunched
over
beneath
the
greenish
gleam
of
the
globe
was
starting
another
length
of
chain
twisting
each
link
with
his
pliers
pressing
it
on
one
side
inserting
it
into
the
next
link
above
opening
it
again
with
the
pointed
tool
continuously
mechanically
not
wasting
a
motion
even
to
wipe
the
sweat
from
his
face
when
gervaise
emerged
from
the
corridor
on
to
the
landing
she
could
not
help
saying
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
does
promise
much
happiness
coupeau
shook
his
head
furiously
he
would
get
even
with
lorilleux
for
that
evening
had
anyone
ever
seen
such
a
miserly
fellow
to
think
that
they
were
going
to
walk
off
with
two
or
three
grains
of
his
gold
dust
all
the
fuss
they
made
was
from
pure
avarice
his
sister
thought
perhaps
that
he
would
never
marry
so
as
to
enable
her
to
economize
four
sous
on
her
dinner
every
day
however
it
would
take
place
all
the
same
on
july
he
did
not
care
a
hang
for
them
nevertheless
gervaise
still
felt
depressed
tormented
by
a
foolish
fearfulness
she
peered
anxiously
into
every
dark
shadow
along
the
as
she
descended
it
was
dark
and
deserted
at
this
hour
lit
only
by
a
single
gas
jet
on
the
second
floor
in
the
shadowy
depths
of
the
dark
pit
it
gave
a
spot
of
brightness
even
with
its
flame
turned
so
low
it
was
now
silent
behind
the
closed
doors
the
weary
laborers
had
gone
to
sleep
after
eating
however
there
was
a
soft
laugh
from
mademoiselle
clemence
room
and
a
ray
of
light
shone
through
the
keyhole
of
mademoiselle
remanjou
door
she
was
still
busy
cutting
out
dresses
for
the
dolls
downstairs
at
madame
gaudron
a
child
was
crying
the
sinks
on
the
landings
smelled
more
offensive
than
ever
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
and
stillness
in
the
courtyard
gervaise
turned
back
for
a
last
look
at
the
tenement
as
coupeau
called
out
to
the
concierge
the
building
seemed
to
have
grown
larger
under
the
moonless
sky
the
of
water
from
the
faucet
sounded
loud
in
the
quiet
gervaise
felt
that
the
building
was
threatening
to
suffocate
her
and
a
chill
went
through
her
body
it
was
a
childish
fear
and
she
smiled
at
it
a
moment
later
watch
your
step
warned
coupeau
to
get
to
the
entrance
gervaise
had
to
jump
over
a
wide
puddle
that
had
drained
from
the
dye
shop
the
puddle
was
blue
now
the
deep
blue
of
a
summer
sky
the
reflections
from
the
night
light
of
the
concierge
sparkled
in
it
like
stars
chapter
iii
gervaise
did
not
want
to
have
a
what
was
the
use
of
spending
money
besides
she
still
felt
somewhat
ashamed
it
seemed
to
her
quite
unnecessary
to
parade
the
marriage
before
the
whole
neighborhood
but
coupeau
cried
out
at
that
one
could
not
be
married
without
having
a
feed
he
did
not
care
a
button
for
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
nothing
elaborate
just
a
short
walk
and
a
rabbit
ragout
in
the
first
they
fancied
no
music
with
dessert
just
a
glass
or
two
and
then
back
home
the
chaffing
and
joking
at
length
got
the
young
woman
to
consent
by
promising
her
that
there
should
be
no
larks
he
would
keep
his
eye
on
the
glasses
to
prevent
sunstrokes
then
he
organized
a
sort
of
picnic
at
five
francs
a
head
at
the
silver
windmill
kept
by
auguste
on
the
boulevard
de
la
chapelle
it
was
a
small
cafe
with
moderate
charges
and
had
a
dancing
place
in
the
rear
beneath
the
three
acacias
in
the
courtyard
they
would
be
very
comfortable
on
the
first
floor
during
the
next
ten
days
he
got
hold
of
guests
in
the
house
where
his
sister
lived
in
the
rue
de
la
monsieur
madinier
mademoiselle
remanjou
madame
gaudron
and
her
husband
he
even
ended
by
getting
gervaise
to
consent
to
the
presence
of
two
of
his
comrades
and
no
doubt
was
a
boozer
but
then
he
had
such
a
fantastic
appetite
that
he
was
always
asked
to
join
those
sort
of
gatherings
just
for
the
sight
of
the
mug
when
he
beheld
that
bottomless
pit
swallowing
his
twelve
pounds
of
bread
the
young
woman
on
her
side
promised
to
bring
her
employer
madame
fauconnier
and
the
boches
some
very
agreeable
people
on
counting
they
found
there
would
be
fifteen
to
sit
down
to
table
which
was
quite
enough
when
there
are
too
many
they
always
wind
up
by
quarrelling
coupeau
however
had
no
money
without
wishing
to
show
off
he
intended
to
behave
handsomely
he
borrowed
fifty
francs
off
his
employer
out
of
that
he
first
of
all
purchased
the
a
twelve
franc
gold
which
lorilleux
procured
for
him
at
the
wholesale
price
of
nine
francs
he
then
bought
himself
a
frock
coat
a
pair
of
trousers
and
a
waistcoat
at
a
tailor
in
the
rue
myrrha
to
whom
he
gave
merely
francs
on
account
his
patent
leather
shoes
and
his
hat
were
still
good
enough
when
he
had
put
by
the
ten
francs
for
his
and
gervaise
share
of
the
feast
the
two
children
not
being
charged
for
he
had
exactly
six
francs
left
the
price
of
a
low
mass
at
the
altar
of
the
poor
he
had
no
liking
for
those
black
crows
the
priests
it
would
gripe
him
to
pay
his
last
six
francs
to
keep
their
whistles
wet
however
a
marriage
without
a
mass
was
a
real
marriage
at
all
going
to
the
church
himself
he
bargained
for
a
whole
hour
with
a
little
old
priest
in
a
dirty
cassock
who
was
as
sharp
at
dealing
as
a
peddler
coupeau
felt
like
boxing
his
ears
for
a
joke
he
asked
the
priest
if
he
did
have
a
mass
that
would
do
for
a
modest
young
couple
the
priest
mumbling
that
god
would
take
small
pleasure
in
blessing
their
union
finally
let
him
have
his
mass
for
five
francs
well
after
all
that
meant
twenty
sous
saved
gervaise
also
wanted
to
look
decent
as
soon
as
the
marriage
was
settled
she
made
her
arrangements
worked
extra
time
in
the
evenings
and
managed
to
put
thirty
francs
on
one
side
she
had
a
great
longing
for
a
little
silk
mantle
marked
thirteen
francs
in
the
rue
du
faubourg
poissonniere
she
treated
herself
to
it
and
then
bought
for
ten
francs
of
the
husband
of
a
washerwoman
who
had
died
in
madame
house
a
blue
woolen
dress
which
she
altered
to
fit
herself
with
the
seven
francs
remaining
she
procured
a
pair
of
cotton
gloves
a
rose
for
her
cap
and
some
shoes
for
claude
her
eldest
boy
fortunately
the
youngsters
blouses
were
passable
she
spent
four
nights
cleaning
everything
and
mending
the
smallest
holes
in
her
stockings
and
chemise
on
friday
night
the
eve
of
the
great
day
gervaise
and
coupeau
had
still
a
good
deal
of
running
about
to
do
up
till
eleven
after
returning
home
from
work
then
before
separating
for
the
night
they
spent
an
hour
together
in
the
young
woman
room
happy
at
being
about
to
be
released
from
their
awkward
position
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
had
originally
resolved
not
to
put
themselves
out
to
impress
the
neighbors
they
had
ended
by
taking
it
seriously
and
working
themselves
till
they
were
weary
by
the
time
they
said
they
were
almost
asleep
on
their
feet
they
breathed
a
great
sigh
of
relief
now
that
everything
was
ready
coupeau
witnesses
were
to
be
monsieur
madinier
and
they
were
counting
on
lorilleux
and
boche
for
gervaise
witnesses
they
were
to
go
quietly
to
the
mayor
office
and
the
church
just
the
six
of
them
without
a
whole
procession
of
people
trailing
behind
them
the
bridegroom
two
sisters
had
even
declared
that
they
would
stay
home
their
presence
not
being
necessary
coupeau
mother
however
had
sobbed
and
wailed
threatening
to
go
ahead
of
them
and
hide
herself
in
some
corner
of
the
church
until
they
had
promised
to
take
her
along
the
meeting
of
the
guests
was
set
for
one
at
the
silver
windmill
from
there
they
would
go
to
going
out
by
railroad
and
returning
on
foot
along
the
highway
in
order
to
work
up
an
appetite
the
party
promised
to
be
quite
all
right
saturday
morning
while
getting
dressed
coupeau
felt
a
qualm
of
uneasiness
in
view
of
the
single
franc
in
his
pocket
he
began
to
think
that
it
was
a
matter
of
ordinary
courtesy
to
offer
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
slice
of
ham
to
the
witnesses
while
awaiting
dinner
also
there
might
be
unforeseen
expenses
so
after
taking
claude
and
etienne
to
stay
with
madame
boche
who
was
to
bring
them
to
the
dinner
later
that
afternoon
he
hurried
over
to
the
rue
de
la
to
borrow
ten
francs
from
lorilleux
having
to
do
that
griped
him
immensely
as
he
could
guess
the
attitude
his
would
take
the
latter
did
grumble
a
bit
but
ended
by
lending
him
two
pieces
however
coupeau
overheard
his
sister
muttering
under
her
breath
this
is
a
fine
beginning
the
ceremony
at
the
mayor
was
to
take
place
at
ten
it
was
beautiful
weather
a
magnificent
sun
seemed
to
roast
the
streets
so
as
not
to
be
stared
at
the
bride
and
bridegroom
the
old
mother
and
the
four
witnesses
separated
into
two
bands
gervaise
walked
in
front
with
lorilleux
who
gave
her
his
arm
whilst
monsieur
madinier
followed
with
mother
coupeau
then
twenty
steps
behind
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
came
coupeau
boche
and
these
three
were
in
black
frock
coats
walking
erect
and
swinging
their
arms
boche
trousers
were
bright
yellow
did
have
a
waistcoat
so
he
was
buttoned
up
to
the
neck
with
only
a
bit
of
his
cravat
showing
the
only
one
in
a
full
dress
suit
was
monsieur
madinier
and
gazed
at
this
gentleman
escorting
the
huge
bulk
of
mother
coupeau
in
her
green
shawl
and
black
bonnet
with
red
ribbons
gervaise
looked
very
gay
and
sweet
in
her
dress
of
vivid
blue
and
with
her
new
silk
mantle
fitted
tightly
to
her
shoulders
she
listened
politely
to
the
sneering
remarks
of
lorilleux
who
seemed
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
immense
overcoat
he
was
wearing
from
time
to
time
gervaise
would
turn
her
head
a
little
to
smile
brightly
at
coupeau
who
was
rather
uncomfortable
under
the
hot
sun
in
his
new
clothes
though
they
walked
very
slowly
they
arrived
at
the
mayor
quite
half
an
hour
too
soon
and
as
the
mayor
was
late
their
turn
was
not
reached
till
close
upon
eleven
they
sat
down
on
some
chairs
and
waited
in
a
corner
of
the
apartment
looking
by
turns
at
the
high
ceiling
and
bare
walls
talking
low
and
pushing
back
their
chairs
each
time
that
one
of
the
attendants
passed
yet
among
themselves
they
called
the
mayor
a
sluggard
saying
he
must
be
visiting
his
blonde
to
get
a
massage
for
his
gout
or
that
maybe
he
swallowed
his
official
sash
however
when
the
mayor
did
put
in
his
appearance
they
rose
respectfully
in
his
honor
they
were
asked
to
sit
down
again
and
they
had
to
wait
through
three
other
marriages
the
hall
was
crowded
with
the
three
bourgeois
wedding
parties
brides
all
in
white
little
girls
with
carefully
curled
hair
bridesmaids
wearing
wide
sashes
an
endless
procession
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
dressed
in
their
best
and
looking
very
stylish
when
at
length
they
were
called
they
almost
missed
being
married
altogether
having
disappeared
boche
discovered
him
outside
smoking
his
pipe
well
they
were
a
nice
lot
inside
there
to
humbug
people
about
like
that
just
because
one
had
yellow
kid
gloves
to
shove
under
their
noses
and
the
various
formalities
the
reading
of
the
code
the
different
questions
to
be
put
the
signing
of
all
the
documents
were
all
got
through
so
rapidly
that
they
looked
at
each
other
with
an
idea
that
they
had
been
robbed
of
a
good
half
of
the
ceremony
gervaise
dizzy
her
heart
full
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
mother
coupeau
wept
bitterly
all
had
signed
the
register
writing
their
names
in
big
struggling
letters
with
the
exception
of
the
bridegroom
who
not
being
able
to
write
had
put
his
cross
they
each
gave
four
sous
for
the
poor
when
an
attendant
handed
coupeau
the
marriage
certificate
the
latter
prompted
by
gervaise
who
nudged
his
elbow
handed
him
another
five
sous
it
was
a
fair
walk
from
the
mayor
office
in
the
town
hall
to
the
church
the
men
stopped
along
the
way
to
have
a
beer
mother
coupeau
and
gervaise
took
cassis
with
water
then
they
had
to
trudge
along
the
long
street
where
the
sun
glared
straight
down
without
the
relief
of
shade
when
they
arrived
at
the
church
they
were
hurried
along
and
asked
if
they
came
so
late
in
order
to
make
a
mockery
of
religion
a
priest
came
forward
his
face
pale
and
resentful
from
having
to
delay
his
lunch
an
altar
boy
in
a
soiled
surplice
ran
before
him
the
mass
went
very
fast
with
the
priest
turning
bowing
his
head
spreading
out
his
arms
making
all
the
ritual
gestures
in
haste
while
casting
sidelong
glances
at
the
group
gervaise
and
coupeau
before
the
altar
were
embarrassed
not
knowing
when
they
should
kneel
or
rise
or
seat
themselves
expecting
some
indication
from
the
attendant
the
witnesses
not
knowing
what
was
proper
remained
standing
during
the
ceremony
mother
coupeau
was
weeping
again
and
shedding
her
tears
into
the
missal
she
had
borrowed
from
a
neighbor
meanwhile
the
noon
chimes
had
sounded
and
the
church
began
to
fill
with
noise
from
the
shuffling
feet
of
sacristans
and
the
clatter
of
chairs
being
put
back
in
place
the
high
altar
was
apparently
being
prepared
for
some
special
ceremony
thus
in
the
depths
of
this
obscure
chapel
amid
the
floating
dust
the
surly
priest
placed
his
withered
hands
on
the
bared
heads
of
gervaise
and
coupeau
blessing
their
union
amid
a
hubbub
like
that
of
moving
day
the
wedding
party
signed
another
registry
this
time
in
the
sacristy
and
then
found
themselves
out
in
the
bright
sunlight
before
the
church
doors
where
they
stood
for
a
moment
breathless
and
confused
from
having
been
carried
along
at
such
a
speed
voila
said
coupeau
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
well
it
sure
take
long
they
shove
it
at
you
so
it
like
being
at
the
painless
dentist
who
does
give
you
time
to
cry
out
here
you
get
a
painless
wedding
yes
it
a
quick
job
lorilleux
smirked
in
five
minutes
you
tied
together
for
the
rest
of
your
life
you
poor
young
cassis
you
had
it
the
four
witnesses
whacked
coupeau
on
the
shoulders
as
he
arched
his
back
against
the
friendly
blows
meanwhile
gervaise
was
hugging
and
kissing
mother
coupeau
her
eyes
moist
a
smile
lighting
her
face
she
replied
reassuringly
to
the
old
woman
sobbing
do
worry
i
do
my
best
i
want
so
much
to
have
a
happy
life
if
it
does
work
out
it
wo
be
my
fault
anyhow
it
done
now
it
up
to
us
to
get
along
together
and
do
the
best
we
can
for
each
other
after
that
they
went
straight
to
the
silver
windmill
coupeau
had
taken
his
wife
arm
they
walked
quickly
laughing
as
though
carried
away
quite
two
hundred
steps
ahead
of
the
others
without
noticing
the
houses
or
the
or
the
vehicles
the
deafening
noises
of
the
faubourg
sounded
like
bells
in
their
ears
when
they
reached
the
wineshop
coupeau
at
once
ordered
two
bottles
of
wine
some
bread
and
some
slices
of
ham
to
be
served
in
the
little
glazed
closet
on
the
ground
floor
without
plates
or
table
cloth
simply
to
have
a
snack
then
noticing
that
boche
and
seemed
to
be
very
hungry
he
had
a
third
bottle
brought
as
well
as
a
slab
of
brie
cheese
mother
coupeau
was
not
hungry
being
too
choked
up
to
be
able
to
eat
gervaise
found
herself
very
thirsty
and
drank
several
large
glasses
of
water
with
a
small
amount
of
wine
added
i
settle
for
this
said
coupeau
going
at
once
to
the
bar
where
he
paid
four
francs
and
five
sous
it
was
now
one
and
the
other
guests
began
to
arrive
madame
fauconnier
a
fat
woman
still
good
looking
first
put
in
an
appearance
she
wore
a
chintz
dress
with
a
flowery
pattern
a
pink
tie
and
a
cap
with
flowers
next
came
mademoiselle
remanjou
looking
very
thin
in
the
eternal
black
dress
which
she
seemed
to
keep
on
even
when
she
went
to
bed
and
the
two
gaudrons
the
husband
like
some
heavy
animal
and
almost
bursting
his
brown
jacket
at
the
slightest
movement
the
wife
an
enormous
woman
whose
figure
indicated
evident
signs
of
an
approaching
maternity
and
whose
stiff
violet
colored
skirt
still
more
increased
her
rotundity
coupeau
explained
that
they
were
not
to
wait
for
his
comrade
would
join
the
party
on
the
route
de
well
exclaimed
madame
lerat
as
she
entered
it
pour
in
torrents
soon
that
be
pleasant
and
she
called
everyone
to
the
door
of
the
wineshop
to
see
the
clouds
as
black
as
ink
which
were
rising
rapidly
to
the
south
of
paris
madame
lerat
eldest
of
the
coupeaus
was
a
tall
gaunt
woman
who
talked
through
her
nose
she
was
unattractively
dressed
in
a
robe
that
hung
loosely
on
her
and
had
such
long
dangling
fringes
that
they
made
her
look
like
a
skinny
poodle
coming
out
of
the
water
she
brandished
her
umbrella
like
a
club
after
greeting
gervaise
she
said
you
no
idea
the
heat
in
the
street
is
like
a
slap
on
the
face
you
think
someone
was
throwing
fire
at
you
everyone
agreed
that
they
knew
the
storm
was
coming
it
was
in
the
air
monsieur
madinier
said
that
he
had
seen
it
as
they
were
coming
out
of
the
church
lorilleux
mentioned
that
his
corns
were
aching
and
he
been
able
to
sleep
since
three
in
the
morning
a
storm
was
due
it
had
been
much
too
hot
for
three
days
in
a
row
well
maybe
it
will
just
be
a
little
mist
coupeau
said
several
times
standing
at
the
door
and
anxiously
studying
the
sky
now
we
have
to
wait
only
for
my
sister
we
start
as
soon
as
she
arrives
madame
lorilleux
was
late
madame
lerat
had
stopped
by
so
they
could
come
together
but
found
her
only
beginning
to
get
dressed
the
two
sisters
had
argued
the
widow
whispered
in
her
brother
ear
i
left
her
flat
she
in
a
dreadful
mood
you
see
and
the
wedding
party
had
to
wait
another
quarter
of
an
hour
walking
about
the
wineshop
elbowed
and
jostled
in
the
midst
of
the
men
who
entered
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
at
the
bar
now
and
again
boche
or
madame
fauconnier
or
left
the
others
and
went
to
the
edge
of
the
pavement
looking
up
at
the
sky
the
storm
was
not
passing
over
at
all
a
darkness
was
coming
on
and
puffs
of
wind
sweeping
along
the
ground
raised
little
clouds
of
white
dust
at
the
first
clap
of
thunder
mademoiselle
remanjou
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
all
the
glances
were
anxiously
directed
to
the
clock
over
the
it
was
twenty
minutes
to
two
here
it
goes
cried
coupeau
it
the
angels
who
weeping
a
gush
of
rain
swept
the
pavement
along
which
some
women
flew
holding
down
their
skirts
with
both
hands
and
it
was
in
the
midst
of
this
first
shower
that
madame
lorilleux
at
length
arrived
furious
and
out
of
breath
and
struggling
on
the
threshold
with
her
umbrella
that
would
not
close
did
any
one
ever
see
such
a
thing
she
exclaimed
it
caught
me
just
at
the
door
i
felt
inclined
to
go
upstairs
again
and
take
my
things
off
i
should
have
been
wise
had
i
done
so
ah
it
a
pretty
wedding
i
said
how
it
would
be
i
wanted
to
put
it
off
till
next
saturday
and
it
rains
because
they
would
listen
to
me
so
much
the
better
so
much
the
better
i
wish
the
sky
would
burst
coupeau
tried
to
pacify
her
without
success
he
would
have
to
pay
for
her
dress
if
it
was
spoilt
she
had
on
a
black
silk
dress
in
which
she
was
nearly
choking
the
bodice
too
tight
fitting
was
almost
bursting
the
and
was
cutting
her
across
the
shoulders
while
the
skirt
only
allowed
her
to
take
very
short
steps
in
walking
however
the
ladies
present
were
all
staring
at
her
quite
overcome
by
her
costume
she
appeared
not
to
notice
gervaise
who
was
sitting
beside
mother
coupeau
she
asked
her
husband
for
his
handkerchief
then
she
went
into
a
corner
and
very
carefully
wiped
off
the
raindrops
that
had
fallen
on
her
silk
dress
the
shower
had
abruptly
ceased
the
darkness
increased
it
was
almost
like
night
a
livid
night
rent
at
times
by
large
flashes
of
lightning
said
laughingly
that
it
would
certainly
rain
priests
then
the
storm
burst
forth
with
extreme
violence
for
half
an
hour
the
rain
came
down
in
bucketsful
and
the
thunder
rumbled
unceasingly
the
men
standing
up
before
the
door
contemplated
the
grey
veil
of
the
downpour
the
swollen
gutters
the
splashes
of
water
caused
by
the
rain
beating
into
the
puddles
the
women
feeling
frightened
had
sat
down
again
holding
their
hands
before
their
eyes
they
no
longer
conversed
they
were
too
upset
a
jest
boche
made
about
the
thunder
saying
that
peter
was
sneezing
up
there
failed
to
raise
a
smile
but
when
the
became
less
frequent
and
gradually
died
away
in
the
distance
the
wedding
guests
began
to
get
impatient
enraged
against
the
storm
cursing
and
shaking
their
fists
at
the
clouds
a
fine
and
interminable
rain
now
poured
down
from
the
sky
which
had
become
an
ashy
grey
it
past
two
cried
madame
lorilleux
we
ca
stop
here
for
ever
mademoiselle
remanjou
having
suggested
going
into
the
country
all
the
same
even
though
they
went
no
farther
than
the
moat
of
the
fortifications
the
others
scouted
the
idea
the
roads
would
be
in
a
nice
state
one
would
not
even
be
able
to
sit
down
on
the
grass
besides
it
did
not
seem
to
be
all
over
yet
there
might
perhaps
be
another
downpour
coupeau
who
had
been
watching
a
workman
completely
soaked
yet
quietly
walking
along
in
the
rain
murmured
if
that
animal
is
waiting
for
us
on
the
route
de
he
wo
catch
a
sunstroke
that
made
some
of
them
laugh
but
the
general
increased
it
was
becoming
ludicrous
they
must
decide
on
something
unless
they
planned
to
sit
there
staring
at
each
other
until
time
for
dinner
so
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
while
the
persistent
rain
continued
they
tried
to
think
of
what
to
do
suggested
that
they
play
cards
boche
slyly
suggesting
a
most
amusing
game
the
game
of
true
confessions
madame
gaudron
thought
of
going
to
eat
onion
tarts
on
the
chaussee
clignancourt
madame
lerat
wanted
to
hear
some
stories
gaudron
said
he
was
a
bit
put
out
and
thought
they
were
quite
well
off
where
they
were
out
of
the
downpour
he
suggested
sitting
down
to
dinner
immediately
there
was
a
discussion
after
each
proposal
some
said
that
this
would
put
everybody
to
sleep
or
that
that
would
make
people
think
they
were
stupid
lorilleux
had
to
get
his
word
in
he
finally
suggested
a
walk
along
the
outer
boulevards
to
pere
lachaise
cemetery
they
could
visit
the
tomb
of
heloise
and
abelard
madame
lorilleux
exploded
no
longer
able
to
control
herself
she
was
leaving
she
was
were
they
trying
to
make
fun
of
her
she
got
all
dressed
up
and
came
out
in
the
rain
and
for
what
to
be
wasting
time
in
a
wineshop
no
she
had
had
enough
of
this
wedding
party
she
rather
be
in
her
own
home
coupeau
and
lorilleux
had
to
get
between
her
and
the
door
to
keep
her
from
leaving
she
kept
telling
them
get
out
of
my
way
i
am
leaving
i
tell
you
lorilleux
finally
succeeded
in
calming
her
down
coupeau
went
over
to
gervaise
who
had
been
sitting
quietly
in
a
corner
with
mother
coupeau
and
madame
fauconnier
you
have
suggested
anything
he
said
to
her
oh
whatever
they
want
she
replied
laughing
i
do
mind
we
can
go
out
or
stay
here
she
seemed
aglow
with
contentment
she
had
spoken
to
each
guest
as
they
arrived
she
spoke
sensibly
in
her
soft
voice
not
getting
into
any
disagreements
during
the
downpour
she
had
sat
with
her
eyes
wide
open
watching
the
lightning
as
though
she
could
see
the
future
in
the
sudden
flashes
monsieur
madinier
had
up
to
this
time
not
proposed
anything
he
was
leaning
against
the
bar
with
the
tails
of
his
dress
coat
thrust
apart
while
he
fully
maintained
the
important
air
of
an
employer
he
kept
on
expectorating
and
rolled
his
big
eyes
about
said
he
we
might
go
to
the
museum
and
he
stroked
his
chin
as
he
blinkingly
consulted
the
other
members
of
the
party
there
are
antiquities
pictures
paintings
a
whole
heap
of
things
it
is
very
instructive
perhaps
you
have
never
been
there
oh
it
is
quite
worth
seeing
at
least
once
in
a
while
they
looked
at
each
other
interrogatively
no
gervaise
had
never
been
madame
fauconnier
neither
nor
boche
nor
the
others
coupeau
thought
he
had
been
one
sunday
but
he
was
not
sure
they
hesitated
however
when
madame
lorilleux
greatly
impressed
by
monsieur
madinier
importance
thought
the
suggestion
a
very
worthy
and
respectable
one
as
they
were
wasting
the
day
and
were
all
dressed
up
they
might
as
well
go
somewhere
for
their
own
instruction
everyone
approved
then
as
it
still
rained
a
little
they
borrowed
some
umbrellas
from
the
proprietor
of
the
wineshop
old
blue
green
and
brown
umbrellas
forgotten
by
different
customers
and
started
off
to
the
museum
the
wedding
party
turned
to
the
right
and
descended
into
paris
along
the
faubourg
coupeau
and
gervaise
again
took
the
lead
almost
running
and
keeping
a
good
distance
in
front
of
the
others
monsieur
madinier
now
gave
his
arm
to
madame
lorilleux
mother
coupeau
having
remained
behind
in
the
wineshop
on
account
of
her
old
legs
then
came
lorilleux
and
madame
lerat
boche
and
madame
fauconnier
and
mademoiselle
remanjou
and
finally
the
two
gaudrons
they
were
twelve
and
made
a
pretty
long
procession
on
the
pavement
i
swear
to
you
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
madame
lorilleux
explained
to
monsieur
madinier
we
do
even
know
how
they
met
or
we
know
only
too
well
but
that
not
for
us
to
discuss
my
husband
even
had
to
buy
the
wedding
ring
we
were
scarcely
out
of
bed
this
morning
when
he
had
to
lend
them
ten
francs
and
not
a
member
of
her
family
at
her
wedding
what
kind
of
bride
is
that
she
says
she
has
a
sister
in
paris
who
works
for
a
pork
butcher
why
did
she
invite
her
she
stopped
to
point
at
gervaise
who
was
limping
awkwardly
because
of
the
slope
of
the
pavement
just
look
at
her
ran
through
the
wedding
procession
lorilleux
laughed
under
his
breath
and
said
they
ought
to
call
her
that
but
madame
fauconnier
stood
up
for
gervaise
they
should
make
fun
of
her
she
was
neat
as
a
pin
and
did
a
good
job
when
there
was
washing
to
be
done
when
the
wedding
procession
came
out
of
the
faubourg
they
had
to
cross
the
boulevard
the
street
had
been
transformed
into
a
morass
of
sticky
mud
by
the
storm
it
had
started
to
pour
again
and
they
had
opened
the
assorted
umbrellas
the
women
picked
their
way
carefully
through
the
mud
holding
their
skirts
high
as
the
men
held
the
umbrellas
over
their
heads
the
procession
stretched
out
the
width
of
the
street
it
a
masquerade
yelled
two
street
urchins
people
turned
to
stare
these
couples
parading
across
the
boulevard
added
a
splash
of
vivid
color
against
the
damp
background
it
was
a
parade
of
a
strange
medley
of
styles
showing
fancy
used
clothing
such
as
constitute
the
luxury
of
the
poor
the
gentlemen
hats
caused
the
most
merriment
old
hats
preserved
for
years
in
dark
and
dusty
cupboards
in
a
variety
of
comical
forms
tall
ones
flattened
ones
sharply
peaked
ones
hats
with
extraordinary
brims
curled
back
or
flat
too
narrow
or
too
wide
then
at
the
very
end
madame
gaudron
came
along
with
her
bright
dress
over
her
bulging
belly
and
caused
the
smiles
of
the
audience
to
grow
even
wider
the
procession
made
no
effort
to
hasten
its
progress
they
were
in
fact
rather
pleased
to
attract
so
much
attention
and
admiration
look
here
comes
the
bride
one
of
the
urchins
shouted
pointing
to
madame
gaudron
oh
is
it
too
bad
she
must
have
swallowed
something
the
entire
wedding
procession
burst
into
laughter
turned
around
and
laughed
madame
gaudron
laughed
the
most
of
all
she
was
ashamed
as
she
thought
more
than
one
of
the
women
watching
had
looked
at
her
with
envy
they
turned
into
the
rue
de
clery
then
they
took
the
rue
du
mail
on
reaching
the
place
des
victoires
there
was
a
halt
the
bride
left
shoe
lace
had
come
undone
and
as
she
tied
it
up
again
at
the
foot
of
the
statue
of
louis
the
couples
pressed
behind
her
waiting
and
joking
about
the
bit
of
calf
of
her
leg
that
she
displayed
at
length
after
passing
down
the
rue
they
reached
the
louvre
monsieur
madinier
politely
asked
to
be
their
cicerone
it
was
a
big
place
and
they
might
lose
themselves
besides
he
knew
the
best
parts
because
he
had
often
come
there
with
an
artist
a
very
intelligent
fellow
from
whom
a
large
dealer
bought
designs
to
put
on
his
cardboard
boxes
down
below
when
the
wedding
party
entered
the
assyrian
museum
a
slight
shiver
passed
through
it
the
deuce
it
was
not
at
all
warm
there
the
hall
would
have
made
a
capital
cellar
and
the
couples
slowly
advanced
their
chins
raised
their
eyes
blinking
between
the
gigantic
stone
figures
the
black
marble
gods
dumb
in
their
hieratic
rigidity
and
the
monstrous
beasts
half
cats
and
half
women
with
faces
attenuated
noses
and
swollen
lips
they
thought
all
these
things
very
ugly
the
stone
carvings
of
the
present
day
were
a
great
deal
better
an
inscription
in
phoenician
characters
amazed
them
no
one
could
possibly
have
ever
read
that
scrawl
but
monsieur
madinier
already
up
on
the
first
landing
with
madame
lorilleux
called
to
them
shouting
beneath
the
vaulted
ceiling
come
along
they
nothing
all
those
things
the
things
to
see
are
on
the
first
floor
the
severe
barrenness
of
the
staircase
made
them
very
grave
an
attendant
superbly
attired
in
a
red
waistcoat
and
a
coat
trimmed
with
gold
lace
who
seemed
to
be
awaiting
them
on
the
landing
increased
their
emotion
it
was
with
great
respect
and
treading
as
softly
as
possible
that
they
entered
the
french
gallery
then
without
stopping
their
eyes
occupied
with
the
gilding
of
the
frames
they
followed
the
string
of
little
rooms
glancing
at
the
passing
pictures
too
numerous
to
be
seen
properly
it
would
have
required
an
hour
before
each
if
they
had
wanted
to
understand
it
what
a
number
of
pictures
there
was
no
end
to
them
they
must
be
worth
a
mint
of
money
right
at
the
end
monsieur
madinier
suddenly
ordered
a
halt
opposite
the
raft
of
the
medusa
and
he
explained
the
subject
to
them
all
deeply
impressed
and
motionless
they
uttered
not
a
word
when
they
started
off
again
boche
expressed
the
general
feeling
saying
it
was
marvellous
in
the
apollo
gallery
the
inlaid
flooring
especially
astonished
the
party
a
shining
floor
as
clear
as
a
mirror
and
which
reflected
the
legs
of
the
seats
mademoiselle
remanjou
kept
her
eyes
closed
because
she
could
not
help
thinking
that
she
was
walking
on
water
they
called
to
madame
gaudron
to
be
careful
how
she
trod
on
account
of
her
condition
monsieur
madinier
wanted
to
show
them
the
gilding
and
paintings
of
the
ceiling
but
it
nearly
broke
their
necks
to
look
up
above
and
they
could
distinguish
nothing
then
before
entering
the
square
salon
he
pointed
to
a
window
saying
that
the
balcony
from
which
charles
ix
fired
on
the
people
he
looked
back
to
make
sure
the
party
was
following
in
the
middle
of
the
salon
carre
he
held
up
his
hand
there
are
only
masterpieces
here
he
said
in
a
subdued
voice
as
though
in
church
they
went
all
around
the
room
gervaise
wanted
to
know
about
the
wedding
at
cana
coupeau
paused
to
stare
at
the
mona
lisa
saying
that
she
reminded
him
of
one
of
his
aunts
boche
and
snickered
at
the
nudes
pointing
them
out
to
each
other
and
winking
the
gaudrons
looked
at
the
virgin
of
murillo
he
with
his
mouth
open
she
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
belly
when
they
had
been
all
around
the
salon
monsieur
madinier
wished
them
to
go
round
it
again
it
was
so
worth
while
he
was
very
attentive
to
madame
lorilleux
because
of
her
silk
dress
and
each
time
that
she
questioned
him
he
answered
her
gravely
with
great
assurance
she
was
curious
about
titian
mistress
because
the
yellow
hair
resembled
her
own
he
told
her
it
was
la
belle
ferronniere
a
mistress
of
henry
iv
about
whom
there
had
been
a
play
at
the
ambigu
then
the
wedding
party
invaded
the
long
gallery
occupied
by
the
italian
and
flemish
schools
more
paintings
always
paintings
saints
men
and
women
with
faces
which
some
of
them
could
understand
landscapes
that
were
all
black
animals
turned
yellow
a
medley
of
people
and
things
the
great
mixture
of
the
colors
of
which
was
beginning
to
give
them
all
violent
headaches
monsieur
madinier
no
longer
talked
as
he
slowly
headed
the
procession
which
followed
him
in
good
order
with
stretched
necks
and
upcast
eyes
centuries
of
art
passed
before
their
bewildered
ignorance
the
fine
sharpness
of
the
early
masters
the
splendors
of
the
venetians
the
vigorous
life
beautiful
with
light
of
the
dutch
painters
but
what
interested
them
most
were
the
artists
who
were
copying
with
their
easels
planted
amongst
the
people
painting
away
unrestrainedly
an
old
lady
mounted
on
a
pair
of
high
steps
working
a
big
brush
over
the
delicate
sky
of
an
immense
painting
struck
them
as
something
most
peculiar
slowly
the
word
must
have
gone
around
that
a
wedding
party
was
visiting
the
louvre
several
painters
came
over
with
big
smiles
some
visitors
were
so
curious
that
they
went
to
sit
on
benches
ahead
of
the
group
in
order
to
be
comfortable
while
they
watched
them
pass
in
review
museum
guards
bit
back
comments
the
wedding
party
was
now
quite
weary
and
beginning
to
drag
their
feet
monsieur
madinier
was
reserving
himself
to
give
more
effect
to
a
surprise
that
he
had
in
store
he
went
straight
to
the
kermesse
of
rubens
but
still
he
said
nothing
he
contented
himself
with
directing
the
others
attention
to
the
picture
by
a
sprightly
glance
the
ladies
uttered
faint
cries
the
moment
they
brought
their
noses
close
to
the
painting
then
blushing
deeply
they
turned
away
their
heads
the
men
though
kept
them
there
cracking
jokes
and
seeking
for
the
coarser
details
just
look
exclaimed
boche
it
worth
the
money
there
one
spewing
and
another
he
watering
the
dandelions
and
that
one
oh
that
one
ah
well
they
a
nice
clean
lot
they
are
let
us
be
off
said
monsieur
madinier
delighted
with
his
success
there
is
nothing
more
to
see
here
they
retraced
their
steps
passing
again
through
the
salon
carre
and
the
apollo
gallery
madame
lerat
and
mademoiselle
remanjou
complained
declaring
that
their
legs
could
scarcely
bear
them
but
the
cardboard
box
manufacturer
wanted
to
show
lorilleux
the
old
jewelry
it
was
close
by
in
a
little
room
which
he
could
find
with
his
eyes
shut
however
he
made
a
mistake
and
led
the
wedding
party
astray
through
seven
or
eight
cold
deserted
rooms
only
ornamented
with
severe
cases
containing
numberless
broken
pots
and
hideous
little
figures
while
looking
for
an
exit
they
stumbled
into
the
collection
of
drawings
it
was
immense
through
room
after
room
they
saw
nothing
interesting
just
scribblings
on
paper
that
filled
all
the
cases
and
covered
the
walls
they
thought
there
was
no
end
to
these
drawings
monsieur
madinier
losing
his
head
not
willing
to
admit
that
he
did
not
know
his
way
ascended
a
flight
of
stairs
making
the
wedding
party
mount
to
the
next
floor
this
time
they
traversed
the
naval
museum
among
models
of
instruments
and
cannons
plans
in
relief
and
vessels
as
tiny
as
playthings
after
going
a
long
way
and
walking
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
party
came
upon
another
staircase
and
having
descended
this
found
itself
once
more
surrounded
by
the
drawings
then
despair
took
possession
of
them
as
they
wandered
at
random
through
long
halls
following
monsieur
madinier
who
was
furious
and
mopping
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
he
accused
the
government
of
having
moved
the
doors
around
museum
guards
and
visitors
looked
on
with
astonishment
as
the
procession
still
in
a
column
of
couples
passed
by
they
passed
again
through
the
salon
carre
the
french
gallery
and
then
along
the
cases
where
minor
eastern
divinities
slumbered
peacefully
it
seemed
they
would
never
find
their
way
out
they
were
getting
tired
and
made
a
lot
of
noise
closing
time
closing
time
called
out
the
attendants
in
a
loud
tone
of
voice
and
the
wedding
party
was
nearly
locked
in
an
attendant
was
obliged
to
place
himself
at
the
head
of
it
and
conduct
it
to
a
door
then
in
the
courtyard
of
the
louvre
when
it
had
recovered
its
umbrellas
from
the
cloakroom
it
breathed
again
monsieur
madinier
regained
his
assurance
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
not
turning
to
the
left
now
he
recollected
that
the
jewelry
was
to
the
left
the
whole
party
pretended
to
be
very
pleased
at
having
seen
all
they
had
four
was
striking
there
were
still
two
hours
to
be
employed
before
the
dinner
time
so
it
was
decided
they
should
take
a
stroll
just
to
occupy
the
interval
the
ladies
who
were
very
tired
would
have
preferred
to
sit
down
but
as
no
one
offered
any
refreshments
they
started
off
following
the
line
of
quays
there
they
encountered
another
shower
and
so
sharp
a
one
that
in
spite
of
the
umbrellas
the
dresses
began
to
get
wet
madame
lorilleux
her
heart
sinking
within
her
each
time
a
drop
fell
upon
her
black
silk
proposed
that
they
should
shelter
themselves
under
the
besides
if
the
others
did
not
accompany
her
she
threatened
to
go
all
by
herself
and
the
procession
marched
under
one
of
the
arches
of
the
bridge
they
were
very
comfortable
there
it
was
most
decidedly
a
capital
idea
the
ladies
spreading
their
handkerchiefs
over
the
sat
down
with
their
knees
wide
apart
and
pulled
out
the
blades
of
grass
that
grew
between
the
stones
with
both
hands
whilst
they
watched
the
dark
flowing
water
as
though
they
were
in
the
country
the
men
amused
themselves
with
calling
out
very
loud
so
as
to
awaken
the
echoes
of
the
arch
boche
and
shouted
insults
into
the
air
at
the
top
of
their
voices
one
after
the
other
they
laughed
uproariously
when
the
echo
threw
the
insults
back
at
them
when
their
throats
were
hoarse
from
shouting
they
made
a
game
of
skipping
flat
stones
on
the
surface
of
the
seine
the
shower
had
ceased
but
the
whole
party
felt
so
comfortable
that
no
one
thought
of
moving
away
the
seine
was
flowing
by
an
oily
sheet
carrying
bottle
corks
vegetable
peelings
and
other
refuse
that
sometimes
collected
in
temporary
whirlpools
moving
along
with
the
turbulent
water
endless
traffic
rumbled
on
the
bridge
overhead
the
noisy
bustle
of
paris
of
which
they
could
glimpse
only
the
rooftops
to
the
left
and
right
as
though
they
were
in
the
bottom
of
a
deep
pit
mademoiselle
remanjou
sighed
if
the
leaves
had
been
out
this
would
have
reminded
her
of
a
bend
of
the
marne
where
she
used
to
go
with
a
young
man
it
still
made
her
cry
to
think
of
him
at
last
monsieur
madinier
gave
the
signal
for
departure
they
passed
through
the
tuileries
gardens
in
the
midst
of
a
little
community
of
children
whose
hoops
and
balls
upset
the
good
order
of
the
couples
then
as
the
wedding
party
on
arriving
at
the
place
vendome
looked
up
at
the
column
monsieur
madinier
gallantly
offered
to
treat
the
ladies
to
a
view
from
the
top
his
suggestion
was
considered
extremely
amusing
yes
yes
they
would
go
up
it
would
give
them
something
to
laugh
about
for
a
long
time
besides
it
would
be
full
of
interest
for
those
persons
who
had
never
been
higher
than
a
cow
pasture
do
you
think
will
venture
inside
there
with
her
leg
all
out
of
place
murmured
madame
lorilleux
i
go
up
with
pleasure
said
madame
lerat
but
i
wo
have
any
men
walking
behind
me
and
the
whole
party
ascended
in
the
narrow
space
afforded
by
the
spiral
staircase
the
twelve
persons
crawled
up
one
after
the
other
stumbling
against
the
worn
steps
and
clinging
to
the
walls
then
when
the
obscurity
became
complete
they
almost
split
their
sides
with
laughing
the
ladies
screamed
when
the
gentlemen
pinched
their
legs
but
they
were
were
stupid
enough
to
say
anything
the
proper
plan
is
to
think
that
it
is
the
mice
nibbling
at
them
it
was
very
serious
the
men
knew
when
to
stop
boche
thought
of
a
joke
and
everyone
took
it
up
they
called
down
to
madame
gaudron
to
ask
her
if
she
could
squeeze
her
belly
through
just
think
if
she
should
get
stuck
there
she
would
completely
block
the
passage
and
how
would
they
ever
get
out
they
laughed
so
at
the
jokes
about
her
belly
that
the
column
itself
vibrated
boche
was
now
quite
carried
away
and
declared
that
they
were
growing
old
climbing
up
this
chimney
pipe
was
it
ever
coming
to
an
end
or
did
it
go
right
up
to
heaven
he
tried
to
frighten
the
ladies
by
telling
them
the
structure
was
shaking
coupeau
meanwhile
said
nothing
he
was
behind
gervaise
with
his
arm
around
her
waist
and
felt
that
she
was
everything
perfect
to
him
when
they
suddenly
emerged
again
into
the
daylight
he
was
just
in
the
act
of
kissing
her
on
the
cheek
well
you
a
nice
couple
you
do
stand
on
ceremony
said
madame
lorilleux
with
a
scandalized
air
pretended
to
be
furious
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
you
made
such
a
noise
together
i
was
even
able
to
count
the
steps
but
monsieur
madinier
was
already
up
on
the
platform
pointing
out
the
different
monuments
neither
madame
fauconnier
nor
mademoiselle
remanjou
would
on
any
consideration
leave
the
staircase
the
thought
of
the
pavement
below
made
their
blood
curdle
and
they
contented
themselves
with
glancing
out
of
the
little
door
madame
lerat
who
was
bolder
went
round
the
narrow
terrace
keeping
close
to
the
bronze
dome
but
it
gave
one
a
rude
emotion
to
think
that
one
only
had
to
slip
off
the
men
were
a
little
paler
than
usual
as
they
stared
down
at
the
square
below
you
would
think
you
were
up
in
detached
from
everything
no
it
was
fun
it
froze
your
very
insides
monsieur
madinier
told
them
to
raise
their
eyes
and
look
straight
into
the
distance
to
avoid
feeling
dizzy
he
went
on
pointing
out
the
invalides
the
pantheon
notre
dame
and
the
montmartre
hill
madame
lorilleux
asked
if
they
could
see
the
place
where
they
were
to
have
dinner
the
silver
windmill
on
the
boulevard
de
la
chapelle
for
ten
minutes
they
tried
to
see
it
even
arguing
about
it
everyone
had
their
own
idea
where
it
was
it
was
worth
while
coming
up
here
to
bite
each
other
noses
off
said
boche
angrily
as
he
turned
to
descend
the
staircase
the
wedding
party
went
down
unspeaking
and
sulky
awakening
no
other
sound
beyond
that
of
shoes
clanking
on
the
stone
steps
when
it
reached
the
bottom
monsieur
madinier
wished
to
pay
but
coupeau
would
not
permit
him
and
hastened
to
place
sous
into
the
hand
two
sous
for
each
person
so
they
returned
by
the
boulevards
and
the
faubourg
du
poissonniers
coupeau
however
considered
that
their
outing
could
not
end
like
that
he
bundled
them
all
into
a
wineshop
where
they
took
some
vermouth
the
repast
was
ordered
for
six
at
the
silver
windmill
they
had
been
waiting
for
the
wedding
party
for
a
good
twenty
minutes
madame
boche
who
had
got
a
lady
living
in
the
same
house
to
attend
to
her
duties
for
the
evening
was
conversing
with
mother
coupeau
in
the
first
floor
room
in
front
of
the
table
which
was
all
laid
out
and
the
two
youngsters
claude
and
etienne
whom
she
had
brought
with
her
were
playing
about
beneath
the
table
and
amongst
the
chairs
when
gervaise
on
entering
caught
sight
of
the
little
ones
whom
she
had
not
seen
all
the
day
she
took
them
on
her
knees
and
caressed
and
kissed
them
have
they
been
good
asked
she
of
madame
boche
i
hope
they
worried
you
too
much
and
as
the
latter
related
the
things
the
little
rascals
had
done
during
the
afternoon
and
which
would
make
one
die
with
laughing
the
mother
again
took
them
up
and
pressed
them
to
her
breast
seized
with
an
overpowering
outburst
of
maternal
affection
it
not
very
pleasant
for
coupeau
all
the
same
madame
lorilleux
was
saying
to
the
other
ladies
at
the
end
of
the
room
gervaise
had
kept
her
smiling
peacefulness
from
the
morning
but
after
the
long
walk
she
appeared
almost
sad
at
times
as
she
watched
her
husband
and
the
lorilleuxs
in
a
thoughtful
way
she
had
the
feeling
that
coupeau
was
a
little
afraid
of
his
sister
the
evening
before
he
had
been
talking
big
swearing
he
would
put
them
in
their
places
if
they
did
behave
however
she
could
see
that
in
their
presence
he
was
hanging
on
their
words
worrying
when
he
thought
they
might
be
displeased
this
gave
the
young
bride
some
cause
for
worry
about
the
future
they
were
now
only
waiting
for
who
had
not
yet
put
in
an
appearance
oh
blow
him
cried
coupeau
let
begin
you
see
he
soon
turn
up
he
got
a
hollow
nose
he
can
scent
the
grub
from
afar
i
say
he
must
be
amusing
himself
if
he
still
standing
like
a
post
on
the
route
de
then
the
wedding
party
feeling
very
lively
sat
down
making
a
great
noise
with
the
chairs
gervaise
was
between
lorilleux
and
monsieur
madinier
and
coupeau
between
madame
fauconnier
and
madame
lorilleux
the
other
guests
seated
themselves
where
they
liked
because
it
always
ended
with
jealousies
and
quarrels
when
one
settled
their
places
for
them
boche
glided
to
a
seat
beside
madame
lerat
had
for
neighbors
mademoiselle
remanjou
and
madame
gaudron
as
for
madame
boche
and
mother
coupeau
they
were
right
at
the
end
of
the
table
looking
after
the
children
cutting
up
their
meat
and
giving
them
something
to
drink
but
not
much
wine
does
nobody
say
grace
asked
boche
whilst
the
ladies
arranged
their
skirts
under
the
so
as
not
to
get
them
stained
but
madame
lorilleux
paid
no
attention
to
such
pleasantries
the
vermicelli
soup
which
was
nearly
cold
was
gulped
down
very
quickly
their
lips
making
a
hissing
noise
against
the
spoons
two
waiters
served
at
table
dressed
in
little
greasy
jackets
and
not
white
aprons
by
the
four
open
windows
overlooking
the
acacias
of
the
courtyard
there
entered
the
clear
light
of
the
close
of
a
stormy
day
with
the
atmosphere
purified
thereby
though
without
sufficiently
cooling
it
the
light
reflected
from
the
humid
corner
of
trees
tinged
the
room
with
green
and
made
leaf
shadows
dance
along
the
from
which
came
a
vague
aroma
of
dampness
and
mildew
two
large
mirrors
one
at
each
end
of
the
room
seemed
to
stretch
out
the
table
the
heavy
crockery
with
which
it
was
set
was
beginning
to
turn
yellow
and
the
cutlery
was
scratched
and
grimed
with
grease
each
time
a
waiter
came
through
the
swinging
doors
from
the
kitchen
a
whiff
of
odorous
burnt
lard
came
with
him
do
all
talk
at
once
said
boche
as
everyone
remained
silent
with
his
nose
in
his
plate
they
were
drinking
the
first
glass
of
wine
as
their
eyes
followed
two
meat
pies
which
the
waiters
were
handing
round
when
entered
the
room
well
you
a
scurvy
lot
you
people
said
he
i
been
wearing
my
pins
out
for
three
hours
waiting
on
that
road
and
a
gendarme
even
came
and
asked
me
for
my
papers
it
is
right
to
play
such
dirty
tricks
on
a
friend
you
might
at
least
have
sent
me
word
by
a
commissionaire
ah
no
you
know
joking
apart
it
too
bad
and
with
all
that
it
rained
so
hard
that
i
got
my
pickets
full
of
water
honor
bright
you
might
still
catch
enough
fish
in
for
a
meal
the
others
wriggled
with
laughter
that
animal
was
just
a
bit
on
he
had
certainly
already
stowed
away
his
two
quarts
of
wine
merely
to
prevent
his
being
bothered
by
all
that
frog
liquor
with
which
the
storm
had
deluged
his
limbs
hallo
count
said
coupeau
just
go
and
sit
yourself
there
beside
madame
gaudron
you
see
you
were
expected
oh
he
did
not
mind
he
would
soon
catch
the
others
up
and
he
asked
for
three
helpings
of
soup
platefuls
of
vermicelli
in
which
he
soaked
enormous
slices
of
bread
then
when
they
had
attacked
the
meat
pies
he
became
the
profound
admiration
of
everyone
at
the
table
how
he
stowed
it
away
the
bewildered
waiters
helped
each
other
to
pass
him
bread
thin
slices
which
he
swallowed
at
a
mouthful
he
ended
by
losing
his
temper
he
insisted
on
having
a
loaf
placed
on
the
table
beside
him
the
landlord
very
anxious
came
for
a
moment
and
looked
in
at
the
door
the
party
which
was
expecting
him
again
wriggled
with
laughter
it
seemed
to
upset
the
caterer
what
a
rum
card
he
was
that
one
day
he
had
eaten
a
dozen
eggs
and
drank
a
dozen
glasses
of
wine
while
the
clock
was
striking
twelve
there
are
not
many
who
can
do
that
and
mademoiselle
remanjou
deeply
moved
watched
chew
whilst
monsieur
madinier
seeking
for
a
word
to
express
his
almost
respectful
astonishment
declared
that
such
a
capacity
was
extraordinary
there
was
a
brief
silence
a
waiter
had
just
placed
on
the
table
a
ragout
of
rabbits
in
a
vast
dish
as
deep
as
a
coupeau
who
liked
fun
started
another
joke
i
say
waiter
that
rabbit
from
the
housetops
it
still
mews
and
in
fact
a
faint
mew
perfectly
imitated
seemed
to
issue
from
the
dish
it
was
coupeau
who
did
that
with
his
throat
without
opening
his
lips
a
talent
which
at
all
parties
met
with
decided
success
so
much
so
that
he
never
ordered
a
dinner
abroad
without
having
a
rabbit
ragout
after
that
he
purred
the
ladies
pressed
their
napkins
to
their
mouths
to
try
and
stop
their
laughter
madame
fauconnier
asked
for
a
head
she
only
liked
that
part
mademoiselle
remanjou
had
a
weakness
for
the
slices
of
bacon
and
as
boche
said
he
preferred
the
little
onions
when
they
were
nicely
broiled
madame
lerat
screwed
up
her
lips
and
murmured
i
can
understand
that
she
was
a
dried
up
stick
living
the
cloistered
life
of
a
woman
imprisoned
within
her
daily
routine
who
had
never
had
a
man
stick
his
nose
into
her
room
since
the
death
of
her
husband
yet
she
had
an
obsession
with
double
meanings
and
indecent
allusions
that
were
sometimes
so
far
off
the
mark
that
only
she
understood
them
as
boche
leaned
toward
her
and
in
a
whisper
asked
for
an
explanation
she
resumed
little
onions
why
of
course
that
quite
enough
i
think
the
general
conversation
was
becoming
grave
each
one
was
talking
of
his
trade
monsieur
madinier
raved
about
the
cardboard
business
there
were
some
real
artists
for
an
example
he
mentioned
christmas
gift
boxes
of
which
he
seen
samples
that
were
marvels
of
splendor
lorilleux
sneered
at
this
he
was
extremely
vain
because
of
working
with
gold
feeling
that
it
gave
a
sort
of
sheen
to
his
fingers
and
his
whole
personality
in
olden
times
jewelers
wore
swords
like
gentlemen
he
often
cited
the
case
of
bernard
palissy
even
though
he
really
knew
nothing
about
him
coupeau
told
of
a
masterpiece
of
a
weather
vane
made
by
one
of
his
fellow
workers
which
included
a
greek
column
a
sheaf
of
wheat
a
basket
of
fruit
and
a
flag
all
beautifully
worked
out
of
nothing
but
strips
of
zinc
shaped
and
soldered
together
madame
lerat
showed
how
to
make
a
rose
by
rolling
the
handle
of
her
knife
between
her
bony
fingers
all
the
while
their
voices
had
been
rising
louder
and
louder
competing
for
attention
shrill
comments
by
madame
fauconnier
were
heard
she
complained
about
the
girls
who
worked
for
her
especially
a
little
apprentice
who
was
nothing
but
a
tart
and
had
badly
scorched
some
sheets
the
evening
before
you
may
talk
lorilleux
cried
banging
his
fist
down
on
the
table
but
gold
is
gold
and
in
the
midst
of
the
silence
caused
by
the
statement
of
this
fact
the
only
sound
heard
was
mademoiselle
remanjou
shrill
voice
continuing
then
i
turn
up
the
skirt
and
stitch
it
inside
i
stick
a
pin
in
the
head
to
keep
the
cap
on
and
that
all
and
they
are
sold
for
thirteen
sous
a
piece
she
was
explaining
how
she
dressed
her
dolls
to
whose
jaws
were
working
slowly
like
grindstones
he
did
not
listen
though
he
kept
nodding
his
head
but
looked
after
the
waiters
to
prevent
them
removing
any
of
the
dishes
he
had
not
cleaned
out
they
had
now
finished
a
veal
stew
with
green
beans
the
roast
was
brought
in
two
scrawny
chickens
resting
on
a
bed
of
water
cress
which
was
limp
from
the
warming
oven
outside
only
the
higher
branches
of
the
acacias
were
touched
by
the
setting
sun
inside
the
greenish
reflected
light
was
thickened
by
wisps
of
steam
rising
from
the
table
now
messy
with
spilled
wine
and
gravy
and
the
debris
of
the
dinner
along
the
wall
were
dirty
dishes
and
empty
bottles
which
the
waiters
had
piled
there
like
a
heap
of
refuse
it
was
so
hot
that
the
men
took
off
their
jackets
and
continued
eating
in
their
shirt
sleeves
madame
boche
please
do
spread
their
butter
so
thick
said
gervaise
who
spoke
but
little
and
who
was
watching
claude
and
etienne
from
a
distance
she
got
up
from
her
seat
and
went
and
talked
for
a
minute
while
standing
behind
the
little
ones
chairs
children
did
not
reason
they
would
eat
all
day
long
without
refusing
a
single
thing
and
then
she
herself
helped
them
to
some
chicken
a
little
of
the
breast
but
mother
coupeau
said
they
might
just
for
once
in
a
while
risk
an
attack
of
indigestion
madame
boche
in
a
low
voice
accused
boche
of
caressing
madame
lerat
knees
oh
he
was
a
sly
one
but
he
was
getting
a
little
too
gay
she
had
certainly
seen
his
hand
disappear
if
he
did
it
again
drat
him
she
would
hesitate
throwing
a
pitcher
of
water
over
his
head
in
the
partial
silence
monsieur
madinier
was
talking
politics
their
law
of
may
is
an
abominable
one
now
you
must
reside
in
a
place
for
two
years
three
millions
of
citizens
are
struck
off
the
voting
lists
i
been
told
that
bonaparte
is
in
reality
very
much
annoyed
for
he
loves
the
people
he
has
given
them
proofs
he
was
a
republican
but
he
admired
the
prince
on
account
of
his
uncle
a
man
the
like
of
whom
would
never
be
seen
again
flew
into
a
passion
he
had
worked
at
the
elysee
he
had
seen
bonaparte
just
as
he
saw
in
front
of
him
over
there
well
that
muff
of
a
president
was
just
like
a
jackass
that
was
all
it
was
said
that
he
was
going
to
travel
about
in
the
direction
of
lyons
it
would
be
a
precious
good
riddance
of
bad
rubbish
if
he
fell
into
some
hole
and
broke
his
neck
but
as
the
discussion
was
becoming
too
heated
coupeau
had
to
interfere
ah
well
how
simple
you
all
are
to
quarrel
about
politics
politics
are
all
humbug
do
such
things
exist
for
us
let
there
be
any
one
as
king
it
wo
prevent
me
earning
my
five
francs
a
day
and
eating
and
sleeping
is
that
so
no
it
too
stupid
to
argue
about
lorilleux
shook
his
head
he
was
born
on
the
same
day
as
the
count
of
chambord
the
of
september
he
was
greatly
struck
with
this
coincidence
indulging
himself
in
a
vague
dream
in
which
he
established
a
connection
between
the
king
return
to
france
and
his
own
private
fortunes
he
never
said
exactly
what
he
was
expecting
but
he
led
people
to
suppose
that
when
that
time
arrived
something
extraordinarily
agreeable
would
happen
to
him
so
whenever
he
had
a
wish
too
great
to
be
gratified
he
would
put
it
off
to
another
time
when
the
king
came
back
besides
observed
he
i
saw
the
count
de
chambord
one
evening
every
face
was
turned
towards
him
it
quite
true
a
stout
man
in
an
overcoat
and
with
a
air
i
was
at
pequignot
one
of
my
friends
who
deals
in
furniture
in
the
grand
rue
de
la
chapelle
the
count
of
chambord
had
forgotten
his
umbrella
there
the
day
before
so
he
came
in
and
just
simply
said
like
this
you
please
return
me
my
umbrella
well
yes
it
was
him
pequignot
gave
me
his
word
of
honor
it
was
not
one
of
the
guests
suggested
the
smallest
doubt
they
had
now
arrived
at
dessert
and
the
waiters
were
clearing
the
table
with
much
clattering
of
dishes
madame
lorilleux
who
up
to
then
had
been
very
genteel
very
much
the
lady
suddenly
let
fly
with
a
curse
one
of
the
waiters
had
spilled
something
wet
down
her
neck
while
removing
a
dish
this
time
her
silk
dress
would
be
stained
for
sure
monsieur
madinier
had
to
examine
her
back
but
he
swore
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
two
platters
of
cheese
two
dishes
of
fruit
and
a
floating
island
pudding
of
frosted
eggs
in
a
deep
had
now
been
placed
along
the
middle
of
the
table
the
pudding
caused
a
moment
of
respectful
attention
even
though
the
overdone
egg
whites
had
flattened
on
the
yellow
custard
it
was
unexpected
and
seemed
very
fancy
was
still
eating
he
had
asked
for
another
loaf
he
finished
what
there
was
of
the
cheese
and
as
there
was
some
cream
left
he
had
the
passed
to
him
into
which
he
sliced
some
large
pieces
of
bread
as
though
for
a
soup
the
gentleman
is
really
remarkable
said
monsieur
madinier
again
giving
way
to
his
admiration
then
the
men
rose
to
get
their
pipes
they
stood
for
a
moment
behind
patting
him
on
the
back
and
asking
him
if
he
was
feeling
better
lifted
him
up
in
his
chair
but
de
dieu
the
animal
had
doubled
in
weight
coupeau
joked
that
was
only
getting
started
that
now
he
was
going
to
settle
down
and
really
eat
for
the
rest
of
the
night
the
waiters
were
startled
and
quickly
vanished
from
sight
boche
who
had
gone
downstairs
for
a
moment
came
up
to
report
the
proprietor
reaction
he
was
standing
behind
his
bar
pale
as
death
his
wife
dreadfully
upset
was
wondering
if
any
bakeries
were
still
open
even
the
cat
seemed
deep
in
despair
this
was
as
funny
as
could
be
really
worth
the
price
of
the
dinner
it
was
impossible
to
have
a
proper
dinner
party
without
the
bottomless
pit
the
other
men
eyed
him
with
a
brooding
jealousy
as
they
puffed
on
their
pipes
indeed
to
be
able
to
eat
so
much
you
had
to
be
very
solidly
built
i
would
care
to
be
obliged
to
support
you
said
madame
gaudron
ah
no
you
may
take
my
word
for
that
i
say
little
mother
no
jokes
replied
casting
a
side
glance
at
his
neighbor
rotund
figure
you
swallowed
more
than
i
have
the
others
applauded
shouting
bravo
it
was
well
answered
it
was
now
pitch
dark
outside
three
were
flaring
in
the
room
diffusing
dim
rays
in
the
midst
of
the
the
waiters
after
serving
the
coffee
and
the
brandy
had
removed
the
last
piles
of
dirty
plates
down
below
beneath
the
three
acacias
dancing
had
commenced
a
and
two
fiddles
playing
very
loud
and
mingling
in
the
warm
night
air
with
the
rather
hoarse
laughter
of
women
we
must
have
a
punch
cried
two
quarts
of
brandy
lots
of
lemon
and
a
little
sugar
but
coupeau
seeing
the
anxious
look
on
gervaise
face
in
front
of
him
got
up
from
the
table
declaring
that
there
should
be
no
more
drink
they
had
emptied
quarts
a
quart
and
a
half
to
each
person
counting
the
children
as
people
that
was
already
too
much
they
had
had
a
feed
together
in
good
fellowship
and
without
ceremony
because
they
esteemed
each
other
and
wished
to
celebrate
the
event
of
the
day
amongst
themselves
everything
had
been
very
nice
they
had
had
lots
of
fun
it
would
do
to
get
cockeyed
drunk
now
out
of
respect
to
the
ladies
that
was
all
he
had
to
say
they
had
come
together
to
toast
a
marriage
and
they
had
done
so
coupeau
delivered
the
little
speech
with
convincing
sincerity
and
punctuated
each
phrase
by
placing
his
hand
on
his
heart
he
won
approval
from
lorilleux
and
monsieur
madinier
but
the
other
four
men
especially
were
already
well
lit
and
sneered
they
declared
in
hoarse
drunken
voices
that
they
were
thirsty
and
wanted
drinks
those
who
thirsty
are
thirsty
and
those
who
are
thirsty
thirsty
remarked
therefore
we
order
the
punch
no
one
need
take
offence
the
aristocrats
can
drink
and
as
the
commenced
another
sermon
the
other
who
had
risen
on
his
legs
gave
himself
a
slap
exclaiming
come
let
have
no
more
of
that
my
boy
waiter
two
quarts
of
your
aged
stuff
so
coupeau
said
very
well
only
they
would
settle
for
the
dinner
at
once
it
would
prevent
any
disputes
the
people
did
not
want
to
pay
for
the
drunkards
and
it
just
happened
that
after
searching
in
his
pockets
for
a
long
time
could
only
produce
three
francs
and
seven
sous
well
why
had
they
made
him
wait
all
that
time
on
the
route
de
he
could
not
let
himself
be
drowned
and
so
he
had
broken
into
his
piece
it
was
the
fault
of
the
others
that
was
all
he
ended
by
giving
the
three
francs
keeping
the
seven
sous
for
the
morrow
tobacco
coupeau
who
was
furious
would
have
knocked
him
over
had
not
gervaise
greatly
frightened
pulled
him
by
his
coat
and
begged
him
to
keep
cool
he
decided
to
borrow
the
two
francs
of
lorilleux
who
after
refusing
them
lent
them
on
the
sly
for
his
wife
would
never
have
consented
to
his
doing
so
monsieur
madinier
went
round
with
a
plate
the
spinster
and
the
ladies
who
were
alone
madame
lerat
madame
fauconnier
mademoiselle
remanjou
discreetly
placed
their
pieces
in
it
first
then
the
gentlemen
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
made
up
the
accounts
they
were
fifteen
it
amounted
therefore
to
francs
when
the
francs
were
in
the
plate
each
man
added
five
sous
for
the
waiters
it
took
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
laborious
calculations
before
everything
was
settled
to
the
general
satisfaction
but
when
monsieur
madinier
who
wished
to
deal
direct
with
the
landlord
had
got
him
to
step
up
the
whole
party
became
lost
in
astonishment
on
hearing
him
say
with
a
smile
that
there
was
still
something
due
to
him
there
were
some
extras
and
as
the
word
extras
was
greeted
with
angry
exclamations
he
entered
into
details
quarts
of
wine
instead
of
twenty
the
number
agreed
upon
beforehand
the
frosted
eggs
which
he
had
added
as
the
dessert
was
rather
scanty
finally
a
quarter
of
a
bottle
of
rum
served
with
the
coffee
in
case
any
one
preferred
rum
then
a
formidable
quarrel
ensued
coupeau
who
was
appealed
to
protested
against
everything
he
had
never
mentioned
twenty
quarts
as
for
the
frosted
eggs
they
were
included
in
the
dessert
so
much
the
worse
for
the
landlord
if
he
choose
to
add
them
without
being
asked
to
do
so
there
remained
the
rum
a
mere
nothing
just
a
mode
of
increasing
the
bill
by
putting
on
the
table
spirits
that
no
one
thought
anything
about
it
was
on
the
tray
with
the
coffee
he
cried
therefore
it
goes
with
the
coffee
go
to
the
deuce
take
your
money
and
never
again
will
we
set
foot
in
your
den
it
six
francs
more
repeated
the
landlord
pay
me
my
six
francs
and
with
all
that
i
have
counted
the
four
loaves
that
gentleman
ate
the
whole
party
pressing
forward
surrounded
him
with
furious
gestures
and
a
yelping
of
voices
choking
with
rage
the
women
especially
threw
aside
all
reserve
and
refused
to
add
another
centime
this
was
some
wedding
dinner
mademoiselle
remanjou
vowed
she
would
never
again
attend
such
a
party
madame
fauconnier
declared
she
had
had
a
very
disappointing
meal
at
home
she
could
have
had
a
dish
for
only
two
francs
madame
gaudron
bitterly
complained
that
she
had
been
shoved
down
to
the
worst
end
of
the
table
next
to
who
had
ignored
her
these
parties
never
turned
out
well
one
should
be
more
careful
whom
one
invites
gervaise
had
taken
refuge
with
mother
coupeau
near
one
of
the
windows
feeling
shamed
as
she
realized
that
all
these
recriminations
would
fall
back
upon
her
monsieur
madinier
ended
by
going
down
with
the
landlord
one
could
hear
them
arguing
below
then
when
half
an
hour
had
gone
by
the
cardboard
box
manufacturer
returned
he
had
settled
the
matter
by
giving
three
francs
but
the
party
continued
annoyed
and
exasperated
constantly
returning
to
the
question
of
the
extras
and
the
uproar
increased
from
an
act
of
vigor
on
madame
boche
part
she
had
kept
an
eye
on
boche
and
at
length
detected
him
squeezing
madame
lerat
round
the
waist
in
a
corner
then
with
all
her
strength
she
flung
a
water
pitcher
which
smashed
against
the
wall
one
can
easily
see
that
your
husband
a
tailor
madame
said
the
tall
widow
with
a
curl
of
the
lip
full
of
a
double
meaning
a
petticoat
specialist
even
though
i
gave
him
some
pretty
hard
kicks
under
the
table
the
harmony
of
the
evening
was
altogether
upset
everyone
became
more
and
more
monsieur
madinier
suggested
some
singing
but
who
had
a
fine
voice
had
disappeared
some
time
before
and
mademoiselle
remanjou
who
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
caught
sight
of
him
under
the
acacias
swinging
round
a
big
girl
who
was
the
and
two
fiddles
were
playing
marchand
de
the
party
now
began
to
break
up
and
the
gaudrons
went
down
to
the
dance
with
boche
sneaking
along
after
them
the
twirling
couples
could
be
seen
from
the
windows
the
night
was
still
as
though
exhausted
from
the
heat
of
the
day
a
serious
conversation
started
between
lorilleux
and
monsieur
madinier
the
ladies
examined
their
dresses
carefully
to
see
if
they
had
been
stained
madame
lerat
fringe
looked
as
though
it
had
been
dipped
in
the
coffee
madame
fauconnier
chintz
dress
was
spotted
with
gravy
mother
coupeau
green
shawl
fallen
from
off
a
chair
was
discovered
in
a
corner
rolled
up
and
trodden
upon
but
it
was
madame
lorilleux
especially
who
became
more
still
she
had
a
stain
on
the
back
of
her
dress
it
was
useless
for
the
others
to
declare
that
she
had
not
she
felt
it
and
by
twisting
herself
about
in
front
of
a
she
ended
by
catching
a
glimpse
of
it
what
did
i
say
cried
she
it
gravy
from
the
fowl
the
waiter
shall
pay
for
the
dress
i
will
bring
an
action
against
him
ah
this
is
a
fit
ending
to
such
a
day
i
should
have
done
better
to
have
stayed
in
bed
to
begin
with
i
off
i
had
enough
of
their
wretched
wedding
and
she
left
the
room
in
a
rage
causing
the
staircase
to
shake
beneath
her
heavy
footsteps
lorilleux
ran
after
her
but
all
she
would
consent
to
was
that
she
would
wait
five
minutes
on
the
pavement
outside
if
he
wanted
them
to
go
off
together
she
ought
to
have
left
directly
after
the
storm
as
she
wished
to
do
she
would
make
coupeau
sorry
for
that
day
coupeau
was
dismayed
when
he
heard
how
angry
she
was
gervaise
agreed
to
leave
at
once
to
avoid
embarrassing
him
any
more
there
was
a
flurry
of
quick
kisses
monsieur
madinier
was
to
escort
mother
coupeau
home
madame
boche
would
take
claude
and
etienne
with
her
for
the
bridal
night
the
children
were
sound
asleep
on
chairs
stuffed
full
from
the
dinner
just
as
the
bridal
couple
and
lorilleux
were
about
to
go
out
the
door
a
quarrel
broke
out
near
the
dance
floor
between
their
group
and
another
group
boche
and
were
kissing
a
lady
and
would
give
her
up
to
her
escorts
two
soldiers
it
was
scarcely
eleven
on
the
boulevard
de
la
chapelle
and
in
the
entire
neighborhood
of
the
the
fortnight
pay
which
fell
due
on
that
saturday
produced
an
enormous
drunken
uproar
madame
lorilleux
was
waiting
beneath
a
about
twenty
paces
from
the
silver
windmill
she
took
her
husband
arm
and
walked
on
in
front
without
looking
round
at
such
a
rate
that
gervaise
and
coupeau
got
quite
out
of
breath
in
trying
to
keep
up
with
them
now
and
again
they
stepped
off
the
pavement
to
leave
room
for
some
drunkard
who
had
fallen
there
lorilleux
looked
back
endeavoring
to
make
things
pleasant
we
will
see
you
as
far
as
your
door
said
he
but
madame
lorilleux
raising
her
voice
thought
it
a
funny
thing
to
spend
one
wedding
night
in
such
a
filthy
hole
as
the
hotel
boncoeur
ought
they
not
to
have
put
their
marriage
off
and
have
saved
a
few
sous
to
buy
some
furniture
so
as
to
have
had
a
home
of
their
own
on
the
first
night
ah
they
would
be
comfortable
right
up
under
the
roof
packed
into
a
little
closet
at
ten
francs
a
month
where
there
was
not
even
the
slightest
air
i
given
notice
we
not
going
to
use
the
room
up
at
the
top
of
the
house
timidly
interposed
coupeau
we
are
keeping
gervaise
room
which
is
larger
madame
lorilleux
forgot
herself
she
turned
abruptly
round
that
worse
than
all
cried
she
you
going
to
sleep
in
room
gervaise
became
quite
pale
this
nickname
which
she
received
full
in
the
face
for
the
first
time
fell
on
her
like
a
blow
and
she
fully
understood
it
too
her
exclamation
the
room
was
the
room
in
which
she
had
lived
for
a
month
with
lantier
where
the
shreds
of
her
past
life
still
hung
about
coupeau
did
not
understand
this
but
merely
felt
hurt
at
the
harsh
nickname
you
do
wrong
to
christen
others
he
replied
angrily
you
do
know
perhaps
that
in
the
neighborhood
they
call
you
because
of
your
hair
there
that
does
please
you
does
it
why
should
we
not
keep
the
room
on
the
first
floor
the
children
wo
sleep
there
and
we
shall
be
very
comfortable
madame
lorilleux
added
nothing
further
but
retired
into
her
dignity
horribly
annoyed
at
being
called
to
cheer
up
gervaise
coupeau
squeezed
her
arm
softly
he
even
succeeded
in
making
her
smile
by
whispering
into
her
ear
that
they
were
setting
up
housekeeping
with
the
grand
sum
of
seven
sous
three
big
pieces
and
one
little
sou
which
he
jingled
in
his
pocket
when
they
reached
the
hotel
boncoeur
the
two
couples
wished
each
other
with
an
angry
air
and
as
coupeau
pushed
the
two
women
into
each
other
arms
calling
them
a
couple
of
ninnies
a
drunken
fellow
who
seemed
to
want
to
go
to
the
right
suddenly
slipped
to
the
left
and
came
tumbling
between
them
why
it
old
bazouge
said
lorilleux
he
had
his
fill
gervaise
frightened
squeezed
up
against
the
door
of
the
hotel
old
bazouge
an
undertaker
helper
of
some
fifty
years
of
age
had
his
black
trousers
all
stained
with
mud
his
black
cape
hooked
on
to
his
shoulder
and
his
black
feather
hat
knocked
in
by
some
tumble
he
had
taken
do
be
afraid
he
harmless
continued
lorilleux
he
a
neighbor
of
ours
the
third
room
in
the
passage
before
us
he
would
find
himself
in
a
nice
mess
if
his
people
were
to
see
him
like
this
old
bazouge
however
felt
offended
at
the
young
woman
evident
terror
well
what
hiccoughed
he
we
ai
going
to
eat
any
one
i
as
good
as
another
any
day
my
little
woman
no
doubt
i
had
a
drop
when
work
plentiful
one
must
grease
the
wheels
it
not
you
nor
your
friends
who
would
have
carried
down
the
stiff
of
stone
whom
i
and
a
pal
brought
from
the
fourth
floor
to
the
pavement
and
without
smashing
him
too
i
like
jolly
people
but
gervaise
retreated
further
into
the
doorway
seized
with
a
longing
to
cry
which
spoilt
her
day
of
joy
she
no
longer
thought
of
kissing
her
she
implored
coupeau
to
get
rid
of
the
drunkard
then
bazouge
as
he
stumbled
about
made
a
gesture
of
philosophical
disdain
that
wo
prevent
you
passing
though
our
hands
my
little
woman
you
perhaps
be
glad
to
do
so
one
of
these
days
yes
i
know
some
women
who
be
much
obliged
if
we
did
carry
them
off
and
as
lorilleux
led
him
away
he
turned
around
and
stuttered
out
a
last
sentence
between
two
hiccoughs
when
you
dead
listen
to
this
when
you
dead
it
for
a
long
long
time
chapter
iv
then
followed
four
years
of
hard
work
in
the
neighborhood
gervaise
and
coupeau
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
happy
couple
living
in
retirement
without
quarrels
and
taking
a
short
walk
regularly
every
sunday
in
the
direction
of
ouen
the
wife
worked
twelve
hours
a
day
at
madame
fauconnier
and
still
found
means
to
keep
their
lodging
as
clean
and
bright
as
a
new
coined
sou
and
to
prepare
the
meals
for
all
her
little
family
morning
and
evening
the
husband
never
got
drunk
brought
his
wages
home
every
fortnight
and
smoked
a
pipe
at
his
window
in
the
evening
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
before
going
to
bed
they
were
frequently
alluded
to
on
account
of
their
nice
pleasant
ways
and
as
between
them
they
earned
close
upon
nine
francs
a
day
it
was
reckoned
that
they
were
able
to
put
by
a
good
deal
of
money
however
during
their
first
months
together
they
had
to
struggle
hard
to
get
by
their
wedding
had
left
them
owing
two
hundred
francs
also
they
detested
the
hotel
boncoeur
as
they
did
like
the
other
occupants
their
dream
was
to
have
a
home
of
their
own
with
their
own
furniture
they
were
always
figuring
how
much
they
would
need
and
decided
three
hundred
and
fifty
francs
at
least
in
order
to
be
able
to
buy
little
items
that
came
up
later
they
were
in
despair
at
ever
being
able
to
collect
such
a
large
sum
when
a
lucky
chance
came
their
way
an
old
gentleman
at
plassans
offered
to
take
the
older
boy
claude
and
send
him
to
an
academy
down
there
the
old
man
who
loved
art
had
previously
been
much
impressed
by
sketches
claude
had
already
begun
to
cost
them
quite
a
bit
now
with
only
etienne
to
support
they
were
able
to
accumulate
the
money
in
a
little
over
seven
months
one
day
they
were
finally
able
to
buy
their
own
furniture
from
a
dealer
on
rue
belhomme
their
hearts
filled
with
happiness
they
celebrated
by
walking
home
along
the
exterior
boulevards
they
had
purchased
a
bed
a
night
table
a
chest
of
drawers
with
a
marble
top
a
wardrobe
a
round
table
covered
with
oilcloth
and
six
chairs
all
were
of
dark
mahogany
they
also
bought
blankets
linen
and
kitchen
utensils
that
were
scarcely
used
it
meant
settling
down
and
giving
themselves
a
status
in
life
as
property
owners
as
persons
to
be
respected
for
two
months
past
they
had
been
busy
seeking
some
new
apartments
at
first
they
wanted
above
everything
to
hire
these
in
the
big
house
of
the
rue
de
la
but
there
was
not
a
single
room
to
let
there
so
that
they
had
to
relinquish
their
old
dream
to
tell
the
truth
gervaise
was
rather
glad
in
her
heart
the
neighborhood
of
the
lorilleux
almost
door
to
door
frightened
her
immensely
then
they
looked
about
elsewhere
coupeau
very
properly
did
not
wish
to
be
far
from
madame
fauconnier
so
that
gervaise
could
easily
run
home
at
any
hour
of
the
day
and
at
length
they
met
with
exactly
what
suited
them
a
large
room
with
a
small
closet
and
a
kitchen
in
the
rue
neuve
de
la
almost
opposite
the
laundress
this
was
in
a
small
building
with
a
very
steep
staircase
there
were
two
apartments
on
the
second
floor
one
to
the
left
the
other
to
the
right
the
ground
floor
was
occupied
by
a
man
who
rented
out
carriages
which
filled
the
sheds
in
the
large
stable
yard
by
the
street
gervaise
was
delighted
with
this
as
it
made
her
feel
she
was
back
in
a
country
town
with
no
close
neighbors
there
would
be
no
gossip
to
worry
about
in
this
little
corner
it
reminded
her
of
a
small
lane
outside
the
ramparts
of
plassans
she
could
even
see
her
own
window
while
ironing
at
the
laundry
by
just
tilting
her
head
to
the
side
they
took
possession
of
their
new
abode
at
the
april
quarter
gervaise
was
then
eight
months
advanced
but
she
showed
great
courage
saying
with
a
laugh
that
the
baby
helped
her
as
she
worked
she
felt
its
influence
growing
within
her
and
giving
her
strength
ah
well
she
just
laughed
at
coupeau
whenever
he
wanted
her
to
lie
down
and
rest
herself
she
would
take
to
her
bed
when
the
labor
pains
came
that
would
be
quite
soon
enough
as
with
another
mouth
to
feed
they
would
have
to
work
harder
than
ever
she
made
their
new
place
bright
and
shiny
before
helping
her
husband
install
the
furniture
she
loved
the
furniture
polishing
it
and
becoming
almost
at
the
slightest
scratch
any
time
she
knocked
into
the
furniture
while
cleaning
she
would
stop
with
a
sudden
shock
as
though
she
had
hurt
herself
the
chest
of
drawers
was
especially
dear
to
her
she
thought
it
handsome
sturdy
and
most
the
dream
that
she
dared
to
mention
was
to
get
a
clock
and
put
it
right
in
the
middle
of
the
marble
top
it
would
make
a
splendid
effect
she
probably
would
have
bought
one
right
away
except
for
the
expected
baby
the
couple
were
thoroughly
enchanted
with
their
new
home
etienne
bed
occupied
the
small
closet
where
there
was
still
room
to
put
another
child
crib
the
kitchen
was
a
very
tiny
affair
and
as
dark
as
night
but
by
leaving
the
door
wide
open
one
could
just
manage
to
see
besides
gervaise
had
not
to
cook
meals
for
thirty
people
all
she
wanted
was
room
to
make
her
soup
as
for
the
large
room
it
was
their
pride
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
they
drew
the
curtains
of
the
alcove
white
calico
curtains
and
the
room
was
thus
transformed
into
a
with
the
table
in
the
centre
and
the
wardrobe
and
chest
of
drawers
facing
each
other
they
stopped
up
the
chimney
since
it
burned
as
much
as
fifteen
sous
of
coal
a
day
a
small
stove
on
the
marble
hearth
gave
them
enough
warmth
on
cold
days
for
only
seven
sous
coupeau
had
also
done
his
best
to
decorate
the
walls
there
was
a
large
engraving
showing
a
marshal
of
france
on
horseback
with
a
baton
in
his
hand
family
photographs
were
arranged
in
two
rows
on
top
of
the
chest
of
drawers
on
each
side
of
an
old
basin
in
which
they
kept
matches
busts
of
pascal
and
beranger
were
on
top
of
the
wardrobe
it
was
really
a
handsome
room
guess
how
much
we
pay
here
gervaise
would
ask
of
every
visitor
she
had
and
whenever
they
guessed
too
high
a
sum
she
triumphed
and
delighted
at
being
so
well
suited
for
such
a
little
money
cried
one
hundred
and
fifty
francs
not
a
sou
more
is
it
almost
like
having
it
for
nothing
the
street
rue
neuve
de
la
goutte
played
an
important
part
in
their
contentment
gervaise
whole
life
was
there
as
she
traveled
back
and
forth
endlessly
between
her
home
and
madame
fauconnier
laundry
coupeau
now
went
down
every
evening
and
stood
on
the
doorstep
to
smoke
his
pipe
the
street
rose
steeply
and
had
no
sidewalks
toward
rue
de
la
goutte
there
were
some
gloomy
shops
with
dirty
windows
there
were
shoemakers
coopers
a
grocery
and
a
bankrupt
cafe
whose
closed
shutters
were
covered
with
posters
in
the
opposite
direction
toward
paris
buildings
blocked
the
sky
their
ground
floor
shops
were
all
occupied
by
laundries
with
one
exception
a
store
front
typical
of
a
its
shop
windows
were
full
of
variously
colored
flasks
it
lighted
up
this
drab
corner
with
the
gay
brightness
of
its
copper
bowls
which
were
always
shining
the
most
pleasant
part
of
the
street
was
in
between
where
the
buildings
were
fewer
and
lower
letting
in
more
sunlight
the
carriage
sheds
the
plant
which
manufactured
soda
water
and
the
opposite
made
a
wide
expanse
of
quietness
the
muffled
voices
of
the
washerwomen
and
the
rhythmic
puffing
of
the
steam
engine
seemed
to
deepen
the
almost
religious
silence
open
fields
and
narrow
lanes
vanishing
between
dark
walls
gave
it
the
air
of
a
country
village
coupeau
always
amused
by
the
infrequent
pedestrians
having
to
jump
over
the
continuous
streams
of
soapy
water
said
it
reminded
him
of
a
country
town
where
his
uncle
had
taken
him
when
he
was
five
years
old
gervaise
greatest
joy
was
a
tree
growing
in
the
courtyard
to
the
left
of
their
window
an
acacia
that
stretched
out
a
single
branch
and
yet
with
its
meager
foliage
lent
charm
to
the
entire
street
it
was
on
the
last
day
of
april
that
gervaise
was
confined
the
pains
came
on
in
the
afternoon
towards
four
as
she
was
ironing
a
pair
of
curtains
at
madame
fauconnier
she
would
not
go
home
at
once
but
remained
there
wriggling
about
on
a
chair
and
continuing
her
ironing
every
time
the
pain
allowed
her
to
do
so
the
curtains
were
wanted
quickly
and
she
obstinately
made
a
point
of
finishing
them
besides
perhaps
after
all
it
was
only
a
colic
it
would
never
do
to
be
frightened
by
a
bit
of
a
but
as
she
was
talking
of
starting
on
some
shirts
she
became
quite
pale
she
was
obliged
to
leave
the
and
cross
the
street
doubled
in
two
holding
on
to
the
walls
one
of
the
workwomen
offered
to
accompany
her
she
declined
but
begged
her
to
go
instead
for
the
midwife
close
by
in
the
rue
de
la
charbonniere
this
was
only
a
false
alarm
there
was
no
need
to
make
a
fuss
she
would
be
like
that
no
doubt
all
through
the
night
it
was
not
going
to
prevent
her
getting
coupeau
dinner
ready
as
soon
as
she
was
indoors
then
she
might
perhaps
lie
down
on
the
bed
a
little
but
without
undressing
on
the
staircase
she
was
seized
with
such
a
violent
pain
that
she
was
obliged
to
sit
down
on
one
of
the
stairs
and
she
pressed
her
two
fists
against
her
mouth
to
prevent
herself
from
crying
out
for
she
would
have
been
ashamed
to
have
been
found
there
by
any
man
had
one
come
up
the
pain
passed
away
she
was
able
to
open
her
door
feeling
relieved
and
thinking
that
she
had
decidedly
been
mistaken
that
evening
she
was
going
to
make
a
stew
with
some
neck
chops
all
went
well
while
she
peeled
the
potatoes
the
chops
were
cooking
in
a
saucepan
when
the
pains
returned
she
mixed
the
gravy
as
she
stamped
about
in
front
of
the
stove
almost
blinded
with
her
tears
if
she
was
going
to
give
birth
that
was
no
reason
why
coupeau
should
be
kept
without
his
dinner
at
length
the
stew
began
to
simmer
on
a
fire
covered
with
cinders
she
went
into
the
other
room
and
thought
she
would
have
time
to
lay
the
cloth
at
one
end
of
the
table
but
she
was
obliged
to
put
down
the
bottle
of
wine
very
quickly
she
no
longer
had
strength
to
reach
the
bed
she
fell
prostrate
and
she
had
more
pains
on
a
mat
on
the
floor
when
the
midwife
arrived
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
she
found
mother
and
baby
lying
there
on
the
floor
the
was
still
employed
at
the
hospital
gervaise
would
not
have
him
disturbed
when
he
came
home
at
seven
he
found
her
in
bed
well
covered
up
looking
very
pale
on
the
pillow
and
the
child
crying
swathed
in
a
shawl
at
its
mother
feet
ah
my
poor
wife
said
coupeau
kissing
gervaise
and
i
was
joking
only
an
hour
ago
whilst
you
were
crying
with
pain
i
say
you
make
much
fuss
about
it
the
time
to
sneeze
and
it
all
over
she
smiled
faintly
then
she
murmured
it
a
girl
right
the
replied
joking
so
as
to
enliven
her
i
ordered
a
girl
well
now
i
got
what
i
wanted
you
do
everything
i
wish
and
taking
the
child
up
in
his
arms
he
continued
let
have
a
look
at
you
miss
you
got
a
very
black
little
mug
it
get
whiter
never
fear
you
must
be
good
never
run
about
the
streets
and
grow
up
sensible
like
your
papa
and
mamma
gervaise
looked
at
her
daughter
very
seriously
with
wide
open
eyes
slowly
overshadowed
with
sadness
for
she
would
rather
have
had
a
boy
boys
can
talk
care
of
themselves
and
do
have
to
run
such
risks
on
the
streets
of
paris
as
girls
do
the
midwife
took
the
infant
from
coupeau
she
forbade
gervaise
to
do
any
talking
it
was
bad
enough
there
was
so
much
noise
around
her
then
the
said
that
he
must
tell
the
news
to
mother
coupeau
and
the
lorilleuxs
but
he
was
dying
with
hunger
he
must
first
of
all
have
his
dinner
it
was
a
great
worry
to
the
invalid
to
see
him
have
to
wait
on
himself
run
to
the
kitchen
for
the
stew
eat
it
out
of
a
soup
plate
and
not
be
able
to
find
the
bread
in
spite
of
being
told
not
to
do
so
she
bewailed
her
condition
and
fidgeted
about
in
her
bed
it
was
stupid
of
her
not
to
have
managed
to
set
the
cloth
the
pains
had
laid
her
on
her
back
like
a
blow
from
a
bludgeon
her
poor
old
man
would
not
think
it
kind
of
her
to
be
nursing
herself
up
there
whilst
he
was
dining
so
badly
at
least
were
the
potatoes
cooked
enough
she
no
longer
remembered
whether
she
had
put
salt
in
them
keep
quiet
cried
the
midwife
ah
if
only
you
could
stop
her
from
wearing
herself
out
said
coupeau
with
his
mouth
full
if
you
were
not
here
i
bet
she
get
up
to
cut
my
bread
keep
on
your
back
you
big
goose
you
must
move
about
otherwise
it
be
a
fortnight
before
you
be
able
to
stand
on
your
legs
your
stew
very
good
madame
will
eat
some
with
me
wo
you
madame
the
midwife
declined
but
she
was
willing
to
accept
a
glass
of
wine
because
it
had
upset
her
said
she
to
find
the
poor
woman
with
the
baby
on
the
mat
coupeau
at
length
went
off
to
tell
the
news
to
his
relations
half
an
hour
later
he
returned
with
all
of
them
mother
coupeau
the
lorilleuxs
and
madame
lerat
whom
he
had
met
at
the
latter
i
brought
you
the
whole
gang
cried
coupeau
it
ca
be
helped
they
wanted
to
see
you
do
open
your
mouth
it
forbidden
stop
here
and
look
at
you
without
ceremony
you
know
as
for
me
going
to
make
them
some
coffee
and
of
the
right
sort
he
disappeared
into
the
kitchen
mother
coupeau
after
kissing
gervaise
became
amazed
at
the
child
size
the
two
other
women
also
kissed
the
invalid
on
her
cheeks
and
all
three
standing
before
the
bed
commented
with
divers
exclamations
on
the
details
of
the
confinement
a
most
remarkable
confinement
just
like
having
a
tooth
pulled
nothing
more
madame
lerat
examined
the
baby
all
over
declared
she
was
well
formed
even
added
that
she
could
grow
up
into
an
attractive
woman
noticing
that
the
head
had
been
squeezed
into
a
point
on
top
she
kneaded
it
gently
despite
the
infant
cries
trying
to
round
it
a
bit
madame
lorilleux
grabbed
the
baby
from
her
that
could
be
enough
to
give
the
poor
little
thing
all
sorts
of
vicious
tendencies
meddling
with
it
like
that
while
her
skull
was
still
soft
she
then
tried
to
figure
out
who
the
baby
resembled
this
almost
led
to
a
quarrel
lorilleux
peering
over
the
women
shoulders
insisted
that
the
little
girl
did
look
the
least
bit
like
coupeau
well
maybe
a
little
around
the
nose
nothing
more
she
was
her
mother
all
over
again
with
big
eyes
like
hers
certainly
there
were
no
eyes
like
that
in
the
coupeau
family
coupeau
however
had
failed
to
reappear
one
could
hear
him
in
the
kitchen
struggling
with
the
grate
and
the
gervaise
was
worrying
herself
frightfully
it
was
not
the
proper
thing
for
a
man
to
make
coffee
and
she
called
and
told
him
what
to
do
without
listening
to
the
midwife
energetic
hush
here
we
are
said
coupeau
entering
with
the
in
his
hand
did
i
just
have
a
bother
with
it
it
all
went
wrong
on
purpose
now
we
drink
out
of
glasses
wo
we
because
you
know
the
cups
are
still
at
the
shop
they
seated
themselves
around
the
table
and
the
insisted
on
pouring
out
the
coffee
himself
it
smelt
very
strong
it
was
none
of
that
weak
stuff
when
the
midwife
had
sipped
hers
up
she
went
off
everything
was
going
on
nicely
she
was
not
required
if
the
young
woman
did
not
pass
a
good
night
they
were
to
send
for
her
on
the
morrow
she
was
scarcely
down
the
staircase
when
madame
lorilleux
called
her
a
glutton
and
a
she
put
four
lumps
of
sugar
in
her
coffee
and
charged
fifteen
francs
for
leaving
you
with
your
baby
all
by
yourself
but
coupeau
took
her
part
he
would
willingly
fork
out
the
fifteen
francs
after
all
those
sort
of
women
spent
their
youth
in
studying
they
were
right
to
charge
a
good
price
it
was
then
lorilleux
who
got
into
a
quarrel
with
madame
lerat
by
maintaining
that
in
order
to
have
a
son
the
head
of
the
bed
should
be
turned
to
the
north
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
at
such
nonsense
offering
another
formula
which
consisted
in
hiding
under
the
mattress
without
letting
your
wife
know
a
handful
of
fresh
nettles
picked
in
bright
sunlight
the
table
had
been
pushed
over
close
to
the
bed
until
ten
gervaise
lay
there
smiling
although
she
was
only
half
awake
she
was
becoming
more
and
more
weary
her
head
turned
sideways
on
the
pillow
she
no
longer
had
the
energy
to
venture
a
remark
or
a
gesture
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
dead
a
very
sweet
death
from
the
depths
of
which
she
was
happy
to
observe
the
others
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
the
thin
cries
of
her
baby
daughter
rose
above
the
hum
of
heavy
voices
that
were
discussing
a
recent
murder
on
rue
du
bon
puits
at
the
other
end
of
la
chapelle
then
as
the
visitors
were
thinking
of
leaving
they
spoke
of
the
christening
the
lorilleux
had
promised
to
be
godfather
and
godmother
they
looked
very
glum
over
the
matter
however
if
they
had
not
been
asked
to
stand
they
would
have
felt
rather
peculiar
coupeau
did
not
see
any
need
for
christening
the
little
one
it
certainly
would
not
procure
her
an
income
of
ten
thousand
francs
and
besides
she
might
catch
a
cold
from
it
the
less
one
had
to
do
with
priests
the
better
but
mother
coupeau
called
him
a
heathen
the
lorilleux
without
going
and
eating
consecrated
bread
in
church
plumed
themselves
on
their
religious
sentiments
it
shall
be
next
sunday
if
you
like
said
the
chainmaker
and
gervaise
having
consented
by
a
nod
everyone
kissed
her
and
told
her
to
take
good
care
of
herself
they
also
wished
the
baby
each
one
went
and
leant
over
the
little
trembling
body
with
smiles
and
loving
words
as
though
she
were
able
to
understand
they
called
her
nana
the
pet
name
for
anna
which
was
her
godmother
name
good
night
nana
come
be
a
good
girl
nana
when
they
had
at
length
gone
off
coupeau
drew
his
chair
close
up
to
the
bed
and
finished
his
pipe
holding
gervaise
hand
in
his
he
smoked
slowly
deeply
affected
and
uttering
sentences
between
the
puffs
well
old
woman
they
made
your
head
ache
have
they
you
see
i
could
prevent
them
coming
after
all
it
shows
their
friendship
but
we
better
alone
are
we
i
wanted
to
be
alone
like
this
with
you
it
has
seemed
such
a
long
evening
to
me
poor
little
thing
she
had
a
lot
to
go
through
those
shrimps
when
they
come
out
into
the
world
have
no
idea
of
the
pain
they
cause
it
must
really
almost
be
like
being
split
in
two
where
does
it
hurt
the
most
that
i
may
kiss
it
and
make
it
well
he
had
carefully
slid
one
of
his
big
hands
under
her
back
and
now
he
drew
her
toward
him
bending
over
to
kiss
her
stomach
through
the
covers
touched
by
a
rough
man
compassion
for
the
suffering
of
a
woman
in
childbirth
he
inquired
if
he
was
hurting
her
gervaise
felt
very
happy
and
answered
him
that
it
did
hurt
any
more
at
all
she
was
only
worried
about
getting
up
as
soon
as
possible
because
there
was
no
time
to
lie
about
now
he
assured
her
that
he
be
responsible
for
earning
the
money
for
the
new
little
one
he
would
be
a
real
bum
if
he
abandoned
her
and
the
little
rascal
the
way
he
figured
it
what
really
counted
was
bringing
her
up
properly
was
that
so
coupeau
did
not
sleep
much
that
night
he
covered
up
the
fire
in
the
stove
every
hour
he
had
to
get
up
to
give
the
baby
spoonfuls
of
lukewarm
sugar
and
water
that
did
not
prevent
his
going
off
to
his
work
in
the
morning
as
usual
he
even
took
advantage
of
his
to
make
a
declaration
of
the
birth
at
the
mayor
during
this
time
madame
boche
who
had
been
informed
of
the
event
had
hastened
to
go
and
pass
the
day
with
gervaise
but
the
latter
after
ten
hours
of
sleep
bewailed
her
position
saying
that
she
already
felt
pains
all
over
her
through
having
been
so
long
in
bed
she
would
become
quite
ill
if
they
did
not
let
her
get
up
in
the
evening
when
coupeau
returned
home
she
told
him
all
her
worries
no
doubt
she
had
confidence
in
madame
boche
only
it
put
her
beside
herself
to
see
a
stranger
installed
in
her
room
opening
the
drawers
and
touching
her
things
on
the
morrow
the
concierge
on
returning
from
some
errand
found
her
up
dressed
sweeping
and
getting
her
husband
dinner
ready
and
it
was
impossible
to
persuade
her
to
go
to
bed
again
they
were
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
her
perhaps
it
was
all
very
well
for
ladies
to
pretend
to
be
unable
to
move
when
one
was
not
rich
one
had
no
time
for
that
sort
of
thing
three
days
after
her
confinement
she
was
ironing
petticoats
at
madame
fauconnier
banging
her
irons
and
all
in
a
perspiration
from
the
great
heat
of
the
stove
on
the
saturday
evening
madame
lorilleux
brought
her
presents
for
her
godchild
a
cup
that
cost
sous
and
a
christening
dress
plaited
and
trimmed
with
some
cheap
lace
which
she
had
got
for
six
francs
because
it
was
slightly
soiled
on
the
morrow
lorilleux
as
godfather
gave
the
mother
six
pounds
of
sugar
they
certainly
did
things
properly
at
the
baptism
supper
which
took
place
at
the
coupeaus
that
evening
they
did
not
come
lorilleux
carried
a
bottle
of
fine
wine
under
each
arm
and
his
wife
brought
a
large
custard
pie
from
a
famous
pastry
shop
on
chaussee
clignancourt
but
the
lorilleuxs
made
sure
that
the
entire
neighborhood
knew
they
had
spent
twenty
francs
as
soon
as
gervaise
learned
of
their
gossiping
furious
she
stopped
giving
them
credit
for
generosity
it
was
at
the
christening
feast
that
the
coupeaus
ended
by
becoming
intimately
acquainted
with
their
neighbors
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
landing
the
other
lodging
in
the
little
house
was
occupied
by
two
persons
mother
and
son
the
goujets
as
they
were
called
until
then
the
two
families
had
merely
nodded
to
each
other
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
street
nothing
more
the
coupeaus
thought
their
neighbors
seemed
rather
bearish
then
the
mother
having
carried
up
a
pail
of
water
for
gervaise
on
the
morrow
of
her
confinement
the
latter
had
thought
it
the
proper
thing
to
invite
them
to
the
feast
more
especially
as
she
considered
them
very
respectable
people
and
naturally
they
there
became
well
acquainted
with
each
other
the
goujets
came
from
the
departement
du
nord
the
mother
mended
lace
the
son
a
blacksmith
worked
at
an
iron
bolt
factory
they
had
lived
in
their
lodging
for
five
years
behind
the
quiet
peacefulness
of
their
life
a
long
standing
sorrow
was
hidden
goujet
the
father
one
day
when
furiously
drunk
at
lille
had
beaten
a
comrade
to
death
with
an
iron
bar
and
had
afterwards
strangled
himself
in
prison
with
his
handkerchief
the
widow
and
child
who
had
come
to
paris
after
their
misfortune
always
felt
the
tragedy
hanging
over
their
heads
and
atoned
for
it
by
a
strict
honesty
and
an
unvarying
gentleness
and
courage
they
had
a
certain
amount
of
pride
in
their
attitude
and
regarded
themselves
as
better
than
other
people
madame
goujet
dressed
in
black
as
usual
her
forehead
framed
in
a
hood
had
a
pale
calm
matronly
face
as
if
the
whiteness
of
the
lace
and
the
delicate
work
of
her
fingers
had
cast
a
glow
of
serenity
over
her
goujet
was
years
old
huge
magnificently
built
with
deep
blue
eyes
and
rosy
cheeks
and
the
strength
of
hercules
his
comrades
at
the
shop
called
him
golden
mouth
because
of
his
handsome
blonde
beard
gervaise
at
once
felt
a
great
friendship
for
these
people
when
she
entered
their
home
for
the
first
time
she
was
amazed
at
the
cleanliness
of
the
lodging
there
was
no
denying
it
one
might
blow
about
the
place
without
raising
a
grain
of
dust
and
the
tiled
floor
shone
like
a
mirror
madame
goujet
made
her
enter
her
son
room
just
to
see
it
it
was
pretty
and
white
like
the
room
of
a
young
girl
an
iron
bedstead
with
muslin
curtains
a
table
a
washstand
and
a
narrow
bookcase
hanging
against
the
wall
then
there
were
pictures
all
over
the
place
figures

madame
goujet
said
with
a
smile
that
her
son
was
a
big
baby
he
found
that
reading
in
the
evening
put
him
to
sleep
so
he
amused
himself
looking
at
pictures
gervaise
spent
an
hour
with
her
neighbor
without
noticing
the
passing
of
time
madame
goujet
had
gone
to
sit
by
the
window
and
work
on
her
lace
gervaise
was
fascinated
by
the
hundreds
of
pins
that
held
the
lace
and
she
felt
happy
to
be
there
breathing
in
the
good
clean
atmosphere
of
this
home
where
such
a
delicate
task
enforced
a
sort
of
meditative
silence
the
goujets
were
worth
visiting
they
worked
long
hours
and
placed
more
than
a
quarter
of
their
fortnight
earnings
in
the
in
the
neighborhood
everyone
nodded
to
them
everyone
talked
of
their
savings
goujet
never
had
a
hole
in
his
clothes
always
went
out
in
a
clean
short
blue
blouse
without
a
stain
he
was
very
polite
and
even
a
trifle
timid
in
spite
of
his
broad
shoulders
the
washerwomen
at
the
end
of
the
street
laughed
to
see
him
hold
down
his
head
when
he
passed
them
he
did
not
like
their
oaths
and
thought
it
disgusting
that
women
should
be
constantly
uttering
foul
words
one
day
however
he
came
home
tipsy
then
madame
goujet
for
sole
reproach
held
his
father
portrait
before
him
a
daub
of
a
painting
hidden
away
at
the
bottom
of
a
drawer
and
ever
since
that
lesson
goujet
never
drank
more
than
was
good
for
him
without
however
any
hatred
of
wine
for
wine
is
necessary
to
the
workman
on
sundays
he
walked
out
with
his
mother
who
took
hold
of
his
arm
he
would
generally
conduct
her
to
vincennes
at
other
times
they
would
go
to
the
theatre
his
mother
remained
his
passion
he
still
spoke
to
her
as
though
he
were
a
little
child
his
skin
toughened
by
the
wielding
of
the
heavy
hammer
he
somewhat
resembled
the
larger
animals
dull
of
intellect
though
all
the
same
in
the
early
days
of
their
acquaintance
gervaise
embarrassed
him
immensely
then
in
a
few
weeks
he
became
accustomed
to
her
he
watched
for
her
that
he
might
carry
up
her
parcels
treated
her
as
a
sister
with
an
abrupt
familiarity
and
cut
out
pictures
for
her
one
morning
however
having
opened
her
door
without
knocking
he
beheld
her
half
undressed
washing
her
neck
and
for
a
week
he
did
not
dare
to
look
her
in
the
face
so
much
so
that
he
ended
by
making
her
blush
herself
young
cassis
with
the
casual
wit
of
a
born
parisian
called
golden
mouth
a
dolt
it
was
all
right
not
to
get
drunk
all
the
time
or
chase
women
but
still
a
man
must
be
a
man
or
else
he
might
as
well
wear
skirts
coupeau
teased
him
in
front
of
gervaise
accusing
him
of
making
up
to
all
the
women
in
the
neighborhood
goujet
vigorously
defended
himself
against
the
charge
but
this
did
prevent
the
two
workingmen
from
becoming
best
of
friends
they
went
off
to
work
together
in
the
mornings
and
sometimes
had
a
glass
of
beer
together
on
the
way
home
it
eventually
came
about
that
golden
mouth
could
render
a
service
to
young
cassis
one
of
those
favors
that
is
remembered
forever
it
was
the
second
of
december
the
decided
just
for
the
fun
of
it
to
go
into
the
city
and
watch
the
rioting
he
did
really
care
about
the
republic
or
napoleon
or
anything
like
that
but
he
liked
the
smell
of
gunpowder
and
the
sound
of
the
rifles
firing
he
would
have
been
arrested
as
a
rioter
if
the
blacksmith
had
turned
up
at
the
barricade
at
just
that
moment
and
helped
him
escape
goujet
was
very
serious
as
they
walked
back
up
the
rue
du
faubourg
poissonniere
he
was
interested
in
politics
and
believed
in
the
republic
but
he
had
never
fired
a
gun
because
the
common
people
were
getting
tired
of
fighting
battles
for
the
middle
classes
who
always
seemed
to
get
the
benefit
of
them
as
they
reached
the
top
of
the
slope
of
the
rue
du
faubourg
poissonniere
goujet
turned
to
look
back
at
paris
and
the
mobs
after
all
some
day
people
would
be
sorry
that
they
just
stood
by
and
did
nothing
coupeau
laughed
at
this
saying
you
would
be
pretty
stupid
to
risk
your
neck
just
to
preserve
the
francs
a
day
for
the
lazybones
in
the
legislative
assembly
that
evening
the
coupeaus
invited
the
goujets
to
dinner
after
desert
young
cassis
and
golden
mouth
kissed
each
other
on
the
cheek
their
lives
were
joined
till
death
for
three
years
the
existence
of
the
two
families
went
on
on
either
side
of
the
landing
without
an
event
gervaise
was
able
to
take
care
of
her
daughter
and
still
work
most
of
the
week
she
was
now
a
skilled
worker
on
fine
laundry
and
earned
up
to
three
francs
a
day
she
decided
to
put
etienne
now
nearly
eight
into
a
small
on
rue
de
chartres
for
five
francs
a
week
despite
the
expenses
for
the
two
children
they
were
able
to
save
twenty
or
thirty
francs
each
month
once
they
had
six
hundred
francs
saved
gervaise
often
lay
awake
thinking
of
her
ambitious
dream
she
wanted
to
rent
a
small
shop
hire
workers
and
go
into
the
laundry
business
herself
if
this
effort
worked
they
would
have
a
steady
income
from
savings
in
twenty
years
they
could
retire
and
live
in
the
country
yet
she
hesitated
saying
she
was
looking
for
the
right
shop
she
was
giving
herself
time
to
think
it
over
their
savings
were
safe
in
the
bank
and
growing
larger
so
in
three
years
time
she
had
only
fulfilled
one
of
her
dreams
she
had
bought
a
clock
but
even
this
clock
made
of
rosewood
with
twined
columns
and
a
pendulum
of
gilded
brass
was
being
paid
for
in
installments
of
sous
each
monday
for
a
year
she
got
upset
if
coupeau
tried
to
wind
it
she
liked
to
be
the
only
one
to
lift
off
the
glass
dome
it
was
under
the
glass
dome
behind
the
clock
that
she
hid
her
bank
book
sometimes
when
she
was
dreaming
of
her
shop
she
would
stare
fixedly
at
the
clock
lost
in
thought
the
coupeaus
went
out
nearly
every
sunday
with
the
goujets
they
were
pleasant
little
excursions
sometimes
to
have
some
fried
fish
at
at
others
a
rabbit
at
vincennes
in
the
garden
of
some
keeper
without
any
grand
display
the
men
drank
sufficient
to
quench
their
thirst
and
returned
home
as
right
as
giving
their
arms
to
the
ladies
in
the
evening
before
going
to
bed
the
two
families
made
up
accounts
and
each
paid
half
the
expenses
and
there
was
never
the
least
quarrel
about
a
sou
more
or
less
the
lorilleuxs
became
jealous
of
the
goujets
it
seemed
strange
to
them
to
see
young
cassis
and
going
places
all
the
time
with
strangers
instead
of
their
own
relations
but
that
the
way
it
was
some
folks
did
care
a
bit
about
their
family
now
that
they
had
saved
a
few
sous
they
thought
they
were
really
somebody
madame
lorilleux
was
much
annoyed
to
see
her
brother
getting
away
from
her
influence
and
begin
to
continually
run
down
gervaise
to
everyone
on
the
other
hand
madame
lerat
took
the
young
wife
side
mother
coupeau
tried
to
get
along
with
everybody
she
only
wanted
to
be
welcomed
by
all
three
of
her
children
now
that
her
eyesight
was
getting
dimmer
and
dimmer
she
only
had
one
regular
house
cleaning
job
but
she
was
able
to
pick
up
some
small
jobs
now
and
again
on
the
day
on
which
nana
was
three
years
old
coupeau
on
returning
home
in
the
evening
found
gervaise
quite
upset
she
refused
to
talk
about
it
there
was
nothing
at
all
the
matter
with
her
she
said
but
as
she
had
the
table
all
wrong
standing
still
with
the
plates
in
her
hands
absorbed
in
deep
reflection
her
husband
insisted
upon
knowing
what
was
the
matter
well
it
is
this
she
ended
by
saying
the
little
draper
shop
in
the
rue
de
la
is
to
let
i
saw
it
only
an
hour
ago
when
going
to
buy
some
cotton
it
gave
me
quite
a
turn
it
was
a
very
decent
shop
and
in
that
big
house
where
they
dreamed
of
living
in
former
days
there
was
the
shop
a
back
room
and
two
other
rooms
to
the
right
and
left
in
short
just
what
they
required
the
rooms
were
rather
small
but
well
placed
only
she
considered
they
wanted
too
much
the
landlord
talked
of
five
hundred
francs
so
you
been
over
the
place
and
asked
the
price
said
coupeau
oh
you
know
only
out
of
curiosity
replied
she
affecting
an
air
of
indifference
one
looks
about
and
goes
in
wherever
there
a
bill
up
that
does
bind
one
to
anything
but
that
shop
is
altogether
too
dear
besides
it
would
perhaps
be
foolish
of
me
to
set
up
in
business
however
after
dinner
she
again
referred
to
the
draper
shop
she
drew
a
plan
of
the
place
on
the
margin
of
a
newspaper
and
little
by
little
she
talked
it
over
measuring
the
corners
and
arranging
the
rooms
as
though
she
were
going
to
move
all
her
furniture
in
there
on
the
morrow
then
coupeau
advised
her
to
take
it
seeing
how
she
wanted
to
do
so
she
would
certainly
never
find
anything
decent
under
five
hundred
francs
besides
they
might
perhaps
get
a
reduction
he
knew
only
one
objection
to
it
and
that
was
living
in
the
same
house
as
the
lorilleux
whom
she
could
not
bear
gervaise
declared
that
she
was
mad
at
anybody
so
much
did
she
want
her
own
shop
that
she
even
spoke
up
for
the
lorilleuxs
saying
that
they
were
mean
at
heart
and
that
she
would
be
able
to
get
along
just
fine
with
them
when
they
went
to
bed
coupeau
fell
asleep
immediately
but
she
stayed
awake
planning
how
she
could
arrange
the
new
place
even
though
she
had
yet
made
up
her
mind
completely
on
the
morrow
when
she
was
alone
she
could
not
resist
removing
the
glass
cover
from
the
clock
and
taking
a
peep
at
the
book
to
think
that
her
shop
was
there
in
those
dirty
pages
covered
with
ugly
writing
before
going
off
to
her
work
she
consulted
madame
goujet
who
highly
approved
her
project
of
setting
up
in
business
for
herself
with
a
husband
like
hers
a
good
fellow
who
did
not
drink
she
was
certain
of
getting
on
and
of
not
having
her
earnings
squandered
at
the
luncheon
hour
gervaise
even
called
on
the
lorilleuxs
to
ask
their
advice
she
did
not
wish
to
appear
to
be
doing
anything
unknown
to
the
family
madame
lorilleux
was
struck
all
of
a
heap
what
was
going
in
for
a
shop
now
and
her
heart
bursting
with
envy
she
stammered
and
tried
to
pretend
to
be
pleased
no
doubt
the
shop
was
a
convenient
one
gervaise
was
right
in
taking
it
however
when
she
had
somewhat
recovered
she
and
her
husband
talked
of
the
dampness
of
the
courtyard
of
the
poor
light
of
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
oh
it
was
a
good
place
for
rheumatism
yet
if
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
take
it
their
observations
of
course
would
not
make
her
alter
her
decision
that
evening
gervaise
frankly
owned
with
a
laugh
that
she
would
have
fallen
ill
if
she
had
been
prevented
from
having
the
shop
nevertheless
before
saying
it
done
she
wished
to
take
coupeau
to
see
the
place
and
try
and
obtain
a
reduction
in
the
rent
very
well
then
if
you
like
said
her
husband
you
can
come
and
fetch
me
towards
six
at
the
house
where
i
working
in
the
rue
de
la
nation
and
we
call
in
at
the
rue
de
la
on
our
way
home
coupeau
was
then
finishing
the
roofing
of
a
new
house
it
so
happened
that
on
that
day
he
was
to
fix
the
last
sheets
of
zinc
as
the
roof
was
almost
flat
he
had
set
up
his
bench
on
it
a
wide
shutter
supported
on
two
trestles
a
beautiful
may
sun
was
setting
giving
a
golden
hue
to
the
and
right
up
at
the
top
against
the
clear
sky
the
workman
was
quietly
cutting
up
his
zinc
with
a
big
pair
of
shears
leaning
over
the
bench
and
looking
like
a
tailor
in
his
shop
cutting
out
a
pair
of
trousers
close
to
the
wall
of
the
next
house
his
boy
a
youngster
of
seventeen
thin
and
fair
was
keeping
the
fire
of
the
chafing
dish
blazing
by
the
aid
of
an
enormous
pair
of
bellows
each
puff
of
which
raised
a
cloud
of
sparks
hi
zidore
put
in
the
irons
cried
coupeau
the
boy
stuck
the
soldering
irons
into
the
midst
of
the
charcoal
which
looked
a
pale
rose
color
in
the
daylight
then
he
resumed
blowing
coupeau
held
the
last
sheet
of
zinc
it
had
to
be
placed
at
the
edge
of
the
roof
close
to
the
there
was
an
abrupt
slant
there
and
the
gaping
void
of
the
street
opened
beneath
the
just
as
though
in
his
own
home
wearing
his
advanced
dragging
his
feet
and
whistling
the
air
oh
the
little
lambs
arrived
in
front
of
the
opening
he
let
himself
down
and
then
supporting
himself
with
one
knee
against
the
masonry
of
a
remained
out
over
the
pavement
below
one
of
his
legs
dangled
when
he
leant
back
to
call
that
young
viper
zidore
he
held
on
to
a
corner
of
the
masonry
on
account
of
the
street
beneath
him
you
confounded
dawdler
give
me
the
irons
it
no
use
looking
up
in
the
air
you
skinny
beggar
the
larks
wo
tumble
into
your
mouth
already
cooked
but
zidore
did
not
hurry
himself
he
was
interested
in
the
neighboring
roofs
and
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
which
rose
from
the
other
side
of
paris
close
to
grenelle
it
was
very
likely
a
fire
however
he
came
and
laid
down
on
his
stomach
his
head
over
the
opening
and
he
passed
the
irons
to
coupeau
then
the
latter
commenced
to
solder
the
sheet
he
squatted
he
stretched
always
managing
to
balance
himself
sometimes
seated
on
one
side
at
other
times
standing
on
the
tip
of
one
foot
often
only
holding
on
by
a
finger
he
had
a
confounded
assurance
the
devil
own
cheek
familiar
with
danger
and
braving
it
it
knew
him
it
was
the
street
that
was
afraid
not
he
as
he
kept
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
he
turned
round
every
now
and
then
to
spit
onto
the
pavement
look
there
madame
boche
he
suddenly
exclaimed
and
called
down
to
her
hi
madame
boche
he
had
just
caught
sight
of
the
concierge
crossing
the
road
she
raised
her
head
and
recognised
him
and
a
conversation
ensued
between
them
she
hid
her
hands
under
her
apron
her
nose
elevated
in
the
air
he
standing
up
now
his
left
arm
passed
round
a
leant
over
have
you
seen
my
wife
asked
he
no
i
have
replied
the
concierge
is
she
around
here
she
coming
to
fetch
me
and
are
they
all
well
at
home
why
yes
thanks
i
the
most
ill
as
you
see
i
going
to
the
chaussee
clignancourt
to
buy
a
small
leg
of
mutton
the
butcher
near
the
only
charges
sixteen
sous
they
raised
their
voices
because
a
vehicle
was
passing
in
the
wide
deserted
rue
de
la
nation
their
words
shouted
out
with
all
their
might
had
only
caused
a
little
old
woman
to
come
to
her
window
and
this
little
old
woman
remained
there
leaning
out
giving
herself
the
treat
of
a
grand
emotion
by
watching
that
man
on
the
roof
over
the
way
as
though
she
expected
to
see
him
fall
from
one
minute
to
another
well
good
evening
cried
madame
boche
i
wo
disturb
you
coupeau
turned
round
and
took
back
the
iron
that
zidore
was
holding
for
him
but
just
as
the
concierge
was
moving
off
she
caught
sight
of
gervaise
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
holding
nana
by
the
hand
she
was
already
raising
her
head
to
tell
the
when
the
young
woman
closed
her
mouth
by
an
energetic
gesture
and
in
a
low
voice
so
as
not
to
be
heard
up
there
she
told
her
of
her
fear
she
was
afraid
by
showing
herself
suddenly
of
giving
her
husband
a
shock
which
might
make
him
lose
his
balance
during
the
four
years
she
had
only
been
once
to
fetch
him
at
his
work
that
day
was
the
second
time
she
could
not
witness
it
her
blood
turned
cold
when
she
beheld
her
old
man
between
heaven
and
earth
in
places
where
even
the
sparrows
would
not
venture
no
doubt
it
not
pleasant
murmured
madame
boche
my
husband
a
tailor
so
i
have
none
of
these
terrors
if
you
only
knew
in
the
early
days
said
gervaise
again
i
had
frights
from
morning
till
night
i
was
always
seeing
him
on
a
stretcher
with
his
head
smashed
now
i
do
think
of
it
so
much
one
gets
used
to
everything
bread
must
be
earned
all
the
same
it
a
precious
dear
loaf
for
one
risks
one
bones
more
than
is
fair
and
she
left
off
speaking
hiding
nana
in
her
skirt
fearing
a
cry
from
the
little
one
very
pale
she
looked
up
in
spite
of
herself
at
that
moment
coupeau
was
soldering
the
extreme
edge
of
the
sheet
close
to
the
gutter
he
slid
down
as
far
as
possible
but
without
being
able
to
reach
the
edge
then
he
risked
himself
with
those
slow
movements
peculiar
to
workmen
for
an
instant
he
was
immediately
over
the
pavement
no
long
holding
on
all
absorbed
in
his
work
and
from
below
one
could
see
the
little
white
flame
of
the
solder
frizzling
up
beneath
the
carefully
wielded
iron
gervaise
speechless
her
throat
contracted
with
anguish
had
clasped
her
hands
together
and
held
them
up
in
mechanical
gesture
of
prayer
but
she
breathed
freely
as
coupeau
got
up
and
returned
back
along
the
roof
without
hurrying
himself
and
taking
the
time
to
spit
once
more
into
the
street
ah
ah
so
you
been
playing
the
spy
on
me
cried
he
gaily
on
beholding
her
she
been
making
a
stupid
of
herself
eh
madame
boche
she
would
call
to
me
wait
a
bit
i
shall
have
finished
in
ten
minutes
all
that
remained
to
do
was
to
fix
the
top
of
the
chimney
a
mere
nothing
the
laundress
and
the
concierge
waited
on
the
pavement
discussing
the
neighborhood
and
giving
an
eye
to
nana
to
prevent
her
from
dabbling
in
the
gutter
where
she
wanted
to
look
for
little
fishes
and
the
two
women
kept
glancing
up
at
the
roof
smiling
and
nodding
their
heads
as
though
to
imply
that
they
were
not
losing
patience
the
old
woman
opposite
had
not
left
her
window
had
continued
watching
the
man
and
waiting
whatever
can
she
have
to
look
at
that
old
said
madame
boche
what
a
mug
she
has
one
could
hear
the
loud
voice
of
the
up
above
singing
ah
it
nice
to
gather
strawberries
bending
over
his
bench
he
was
now
artistically
cutting
out
his
zinc
with
his
compasses
he
traced
a
line
and
he
detached
a
large
piece
with
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
curved
shears
then
he
lightly
bent
this
fan
with
his
hammer
into
the
form
of
a
pointed
mushroom
zidore
was
again
blowing
the
charcoal
in
the
the
sun
was
setting
behind
the
house
in
a
brilliant
rosy
light
which
was
gradually
becoming
paler
and
turning
to
a
delicate
lilac
and
at
this
quiet
hour
of
the
day
right
up
against
the
sky
the
silhouettes
of
the
two
workmen
looking
inordinately
large
with
the
dark
line
of
the
bench
and
the
strange
profile
of
the
bellows
stood
out
from
the
limpid
of
the
atmosphere
when
the
was
got
into
shape
coupeau
called
out
zidore
the
irons
but
zidore
had
disappeared
the
swore
and
looked
about
for
him
even
calling
him
through
the
open
skylight
of
the
loft
at
length
he
discovered
him
on
a
neighboring
roof
two
houses
off
the
young
rogue
was
taking
a
walk
exploring
the
environs
his
fair
scanty
locks
blowing
in
the
breeze
his
eyes
blinking
as
they
beheld
the
immensity
of
paris
i
say
lazy
bones
do
you
think
you
having
a
day
in
the
country
asked
coupeau
in
a
rage
you
like
monsieur
beranger
composing
verses
perhaps
will
you
give
me
those
irons
did
any
one
ever
see
such
a
thing
strolling
about
on
the
why
not
bring
your
sweetheart
at
once
and
tell
her
of
your
love
will
you
give
me
those
irons
you
confounded
little
shirker
he
finished
his
soldering
and
called
to
gervaise
there
it
done
i
coming
down
the
to
which
he
had
to
fix
the
flue
was
in
the
middle
of
the
roof
gervaise
who
was
no
longer
uneasy
continued
to
smile
as
she
followed
his
movements
nana
amused
all
on
a
sudden
by
the
view
of
her
father
clapped
her
little
hands
she
had
seated
herself
on
the
pavement
to
see
the
better
up
there
papa
papa
called
she
with
all
her
might
papa
just
look
the
wished
to
lean
forward
but
his
foot
slipped
then
suddenly
stupidly
like
a
cat
with
its
legs
entangled
he
rolled
and
descended
the
slight
slope
of
the
roof
without
being
able
to
grab
hold
of
anything
he
cried
in
a
choked
voice
and
he
fell
his
body
described
a
gentle
curve
turned
twice
over
on
itself
and
came
smashing
into
the
middle
of
the
street
with
the
dull
thud
of
a
bundle
of
clothes
thrown
from
on
high
gervaise
stupefied
her
throat
rent
by
one
great
cry
stood
holding
up
her
arms
some
hastened
to
the
spot
a
crowd
soon
formed
madame
boche
utterly
upset
her
knees
bending
under
her
took
nana
in
her
arms
to
hide
her
head
and
prevent
her
seeing
meanwhile
the
little
old
woman
opposite
quietly
closed
her
window
as
though
satisfied
four
men
ended
by
carrying
coupeau
into
a
chemist
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
poissonniers
and
he
remained
there
on
a
blanket
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
whilst
they
sent
to
the
lariboisiere
hospital
for
a
stretcher
he
was
still
breathing
gervaise
sobbing
was
kneeling
on
the
floor
beside
him
her
face
smudged
with
tears
stunned
and
unseeing
her
hands
would
reach
to
feel
her
husband
limbs
with
the
utmost
gentleness
then
she
would
draw
back
as
she
had
been
warned
not
to
touch
him
but
a
few
seconds
later
she
would
touch
him
to
assure
herself
that
he
was
still
warm
feeling
somehow
that
she
was
helping
him
when
the
stretcher
at
length
arrived
and
they
talked
of
starting
for
the
hospital
she
got
up
saying
violently
no
no
not
to
the
hospital
we
live
in
the
rue
neuve
de
la
it
was
useless
for
them
to
explain
to
her
that
the
illness
would
cost
her
a
great
deal
of
money
if
she
took
her
husband
home
she
obstinately
repeated
rue
neuve
de
la
i
will
show
you
the
house
what
can
it
matter
to
you
i
got
money
he
my
husband
is
he
he
mine
and
i
want
him
at
home
and
they
had
to
take
coupeau
to
his
own
home
when
the
stretcher
was
carried
through
the
crowd
which
was
crushing
up
against
the
shop
the
women
of
the
neighborhood
were
excitedly
talking
of
gervaise
she
limped
the
dolt
but
all
the
same
she
had
some
pluck
she
would
be
sure
to
save
her
old
man
whilst
at
the
hospital
the
doctors
let
the
patients
die
who
were
very
bad
so
as
not
to
have
the
bother
of
trying
to
cure
them
madame
boche
after
taking
nana
home
with
her
returned
and
gave
her
account
of
the
accident
with
interminable
details
and
still
feeling
agitated
with
the
emotion
she
had
passed
through
i
was
going
to
buy
a
leg
of
mutton
i
was
there
i
saw
him
fall
repeated
she
it
was
all
through
the
little
one
he
turned
to
look
at
her
and
bang
ah
good
heavens
i
never
want
to
see
such
a
sight
again
however
i
must
be
off
to
get
my
leg
of
mutton
for
a
week
coupeau
was
very
bad
the
family
the
neighbors
everyone
expected
to
see
him
turn
for
the
worse
at
any
moment
the
doctor
a
very
expensive
doctor
who
charged
five
francs
for
each
visit
apprehended
internal
injuries
and
these
words
filled
everyone
with
fear
it
was
said
in
the
neighborhood
that
the
heart
had
been
injured
by
the
shock
gervaise
alone
looking
pale
through
her
nights
of
watching
serious
and
resolute
shrugged
her
shoulders
her
old
right
leg
was
broken
everyone
knew
that
it
would
be
set
for
him
and
that
was
all
as
for
the
rest
the
injured
heart
that
was
nothing
she
knew
how
to
restore
a
heart
with
ceaseless
care
she
was
certain
of
getting
him
well
and
displayed
magnificent
faith
she
stayed
close
by
him
and
caressed
him
gently
during
the
long
bouts
of
fever
without
a
moment
of
doubt
she
was
on
her
feet
continuously
for
a
whole
week
completely
absorbed
by
her
determination
to
save
him
she
forgot
the
street
outside
the
entire
city
and
even
her
own
children
on
the
ninth
day
the
doctor
finally
said
that
coupeau
would
live
gervaise
collapsed
into
a
chair
her
body
limp
from
fatigue
that
night
she
consented
to
sleep
for
two
hours
with
her
head
against
the
foot
of
the
bed
coupeau
accident
had
created
quite
a
commotion
in
the
family
mother
coupeau
passed
the
nights
with
gervaise
but
as
early
as
nine
she
fell
asleep
on
a
chair
every
evening
on
returning
from
work
madame
lerat
went
a
long
round
out
of
her
way
to
inquire
how
her
brother
was
getting
on
at
first
the
lorilleuxs
had
called
two
or
three
times
a
day
offering
to
sit
up
and
watch
and
even
bringing
an
for
gervaise
then
it
was
not
long
before
there
were
disputes
as
to
the
proper
way
to
nurse
invalids
madame
lorilleux
said
that
she
had
saved
enough
people
lives
to
know
how
to
go
about
it
she
accused
the
young
wife
of
pushing
her
aside
of
driving
her
away
from
her
own
bed
certainly
that
ought
to
be
concerned
about
getting
well
for
if
she
had
gone
to
rue
de
la
nation
to
disturb
him
at
his
job
he
would
never
had
fallen
only
the
way
she
was
taking
care
of
him
she
would
certainly
finish
him
when
gervaise
saw
that
coupeau
was
out
of
danger
she
ceased
guarding
his
bedside
with
so
much
jealous
fierceness
now
they
could
no
longer
kill
him
and
she
let
people
approach
without
mistrust
the
family
invaded
the
room
the
convalescence
would
be
a
very
long
one
the
doctor
had
talked
of
four
months
then
during
the
long
hours
the
slept
the
lorilleux
talked
of
gervaise
as
of
a
fool
she
had
done
any
good
by
having
her
husband
at
home
at
the
hospital
they
would
have
cured
him
twice
as
quickly
lorilleux
would
have
liked
to
have
been
ill
to
have
caught
no
matter
what
just
to
show
her
that
he
did
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
go
to
lariboisiere
madame
lorilleux
knew
a
lady
who
had
just
come
from
there
well
she
had
had
chicken
to
eat
morning
and
night
again
and
again
the
two
of
them
went
over
their
estimate
of
how
much
four
months
of
convalescence
would
cost
workdays
lost
the
doctor
and
the
medicines
and
afterward
good
wine
and
fresh
meat
if
the
coupeaus
only
used
up
their
small
savings
they
would
be
very
lucky
indeed
they
would
probably
have
to
go
into
debt
well
that
was
to
be
expected
and
it
was
their
business
they
had
no
right
to
expect
any
help
from
the
family
which
could
afford
the
luxury
of
keeping
an
invalid
at
home
it
was
just
bad
luck
was
it
why
could
she
have
done
as
others
did
and
let
her
man
be
taken
to
hospital
this
just
showed
how
stuck
up
she
was
one
evening
madame
lorilleux
had
the
spitefulness
to
ask
gervaise
suddenly
well
and
your
shop
when
are
you
going
to
take
it
yes
chuckled
lorilleux
the
landlord
still
waiting
for
you
gervaise
was
astonished
she
had
completely
forgotten
the
shop
but
she
saw
the
wicked
joy
of
those
people
at
the
thought
that
she
would
no
longer
be
able
to
take
it
and
she
was
bursting
with
anger
from
that
evening
in
fact
they
watched
for
every
opportunity
to
twit
her
about
her
hopeless
dream
when
any
one
spoke
of
some
impossible
wish
they
would
say
that
it
might
be
realized
on
the
day
that
gervaise
started
in
business
in
a
beautiful
shop
opening
onto
the
street
and
behind
her
back
they
would
laugh
fit
to
split
their
sides
she
did
not
like
to
think
such
an
unkind
thing
but
really
the
lorilleuxs
now
seemed
to
be
very
pleased
at
coupeau
accident
as
it
prevented
her
setting
up
as
a
laundress
in
the
rue
de
la
then
she
also
wished
to
laugh
and
show
them
how
willingly
she
parted
with
the
money
for
the
sake
of
curing
her
husband
each
time
she
took
the
book
from
beneath
the
glass
in
their
presence
she
would
say
gaily
i
going
out
i
going
to
rent
my
shop
she
had
not
been
willing
to
withdraw
the
money
all
at
once
she
took
it
out
a
hundred
francs
at
a
time
so
as
not
to
keep
such
a
pile
of
gold
and
silver
in
her
drawer
then
too
she
vaguely
hoped
for
some
miracle
some
sudden
recovery
which
would
enable
them
not
to
part
with
the
entire
sum
at
each
journey
to
the
on
her
return
home
she
added
up
on
a
piece
of
paper
the
money
they
had
still
left
there
it
was
merely
for
the
sake
of
order
their
bank
account
might
be
getting
smaller
all
the
time
yet
she
went
on
with
her
quiet
smile
and
attitude
keeping
the
account
straight
it
was
a
consolation
to
be
able
to
use
this
money
for
such
a
good
purpose
to
have
had
it
when
faced
with
their
misfortune
while
coupeau
was
the
goujets
were
very
kind
to
gervaise
madame
goujet
was
always
ready
to
assist
she
never
went
to
shop
without
stopping
to
ask
gervaise
if
there
was
anything
she
needed
sugar
or
butter
or
salt
she
always
brought
over
hot
bouillon
on
the
evenings
she
cooked
au
sometimes
when
gervaise
seemed
to
have
too
much
to
do
madame
goujet
helped
her
do
the
dishes
or
cleaned
the
kitchen
herself
goujet
took
her
water
pails
every
morning
and
filled
them
at
the
tap
on
rue
des
poissonniers
saving
her
two
sous
a
day
after
dinner
if
no
family
came
to
visit
the
goujets
would
come
over
to
visit
with
the
coupeaus
until
ten
the
blacksmith
would
smoke
his
pipe
and
watch
gervaise
busy
with
her
invalid
he
would
not
speak
ten
words
the
entire
evening
he
was
moved
to
pity
by
the
sight
of
her
pouring
coupeau
tea
and
medicine
into
a
cup
or
stirring
the
sugar
in
it
very
carefully
so
as
to
make
no
sound
with
the
spoon
it
stirred
him
deeply
when
she
would
lean
over
coupeau
and
speak
in
her
soft
voice
never
before
had
he
known
such
a
fine
woman
her
limp
increased
the
credit
due
her
for
wearing
herself
out
doing
things
for
her
husband
all
day
long
she
never
sat
down
for
ten
minutes
not
even
to
eat
she
was
always
running
to
the
chemist
and
then
she
would
still
keep
the
house
clean
not
even
a
speck
of
dust
she
never
complained
no
matter
how
exhausted
she
became
goujet
developed
a
very
deep
affection
for
gervaise
in
this
atmosphere
of
unselfish
devotion
one
day
he
said
to
the
invalid
well
old
man
now
you
patched
up
again
i
was
worried
about
you
your
wife
works
miracles
goujet
was
supposed
to
be
getting
married
his
mother
had
found
a
suitable
girl
a
like
herself
whom
she
was
urging
him
to
marry
he
had
agreed
so
as
not
to
hurt
her
feelings
and
the
wedding
had
been
set
for
early
september
money
had
long
since
been
saved
to
set
them
up
in
housekeeping
however
when
gervaise
referred
to
his
coming
marriage
he
shook
his
head
saying
not
every
woman
is
like
you
madame
coupeau
if
all
women
were
like
you
i
marry
ten
of
them
at
the
end
of
two
months
coupeau
was
able
to
get
up
he
did
not
go
far
only
from
the
bed
to
the
window
and
even
then
gervaise
had
to
support
him
there
he
would
sit
down
in
the
the
lorilleuxs
had
brought
with
his
right
leg
stretched
out
on
a
stool
this
joker
who
used
to
laugh
at
the
people
who
slipped
down
on
frosty
days
felt
greatly
put
out
by
his
accident
he
had
no
philosophy
he
had
spent
those
two
months
in
bed
in
cursing
and
in
worrying
the
people
about
him
it
was
not
an
existence
really
to
pass
one
life
on
one
back
with
a
pin
all
tied
up
and
as
stiff
as
a
sausage
ah
he
certainly
knew
the
ceiling
by
heart
there
was
a
crack
at
the
corner
of
the
alcove
that
he
could
have
drawn
with
his
eyes
shut
then
when
he
was
made
comfortable
in
the
it
was
another
grievance
would
he
be
fixed
there
for
long
just
like
a
mummy
nobody
ever
passed
along
the
street
so
it
was
no
fun
to
watch
besides
it
stank
of
bleach
water
all
day
no
he
was
just
growing
old
he
have
given
ten
years
of
his
life
just
to
go
see
how
the
fortifications
were
getting
along
he
kept
going
on
about
his
fate
it
was
right
what
had
happened
to
him
a
good
worker
like
him
not
a
loafer
or
a
drunkard
he
could
have
understood
in
that
case
papa
coupeau
said
he
broke
his
neck
one
day
that
he
been
boozing
i
ca
say
that
it
was
deserved
but
anyhow
it
was
explainable
i
had
had
nothing
since
my
lunch
was
perfectly
quiet
and
without
a
drop
of
liquor
in
my
body
and
yet
i
came
to
grief
just
because
i
wanted
to
turn
round
to
smile
at
nana
do
you
think
that
too
much
if
there
is
a
providence
it
certainly
arranges
things
in
a
very
peculiar
manner
i
for
one
shall
never
believe
in
it
and
when
at
last
he
was
able
to
use
his
legs
he
retained
a
secret
grudge
against
work
it
was
a
handicraft
full
of
misfortunes
to
pass
one
days
like
the
cats
on
the
roofs
of
the
houses
the
employers
were
no
fools
they
sent
you
to
your
death
being
far
too
cowardly
to
venture
themselves
on
a
ladder
and
stopped
at
home
in
safety
at
their
without
caring
a
hang
for
the
poorer
classes
and
he
got
to
the
point
of
saying
that
everyone
ought
to
fix
the
zinc
himself
on
his
own
house
it
was
the
only
fair
way
to
do
it
if
you
want
the
rain
to
come
in
do
the
work
yourself
he
regretted
he
had
learned
another
trade
something
more
pleasant
something
less
dangerous
maybe
cabinetmaking
it
was
really
his
father
fault
lots
of
fathers
have
the
foolish
habit
of
shoving
their
sons
into
their
own
line
of
work
for
another
two
months
coupeau
hobbled
about
on
crutches
he
had
first
of
all
managed
to
get
as
far
as
the
street
and
smoke
his
pipe
in
front
of
the
door
then
he
had
managed
to
reach
the
exterior
boulevard
dragging
himself
along
in
the
sunshine
and
remaining
for
hours
on
one
of
the
seats
gaiety
returned
to
him
his
infernal
tongue
got
sharper
in
these
long
hours
of
idleness
and
with
the
pleasure
of
living
he
gained
there
a
delight
in
doing
nothing
an
indolent
feeling
took
possession
of
his
limbs
and
his
muscles
gradually
glided
into
a
very
sweet
slumber
it
was
the
slow
victory
of
laziness
which
took
advantage
of
his
convalescence
to
obtain
possession
of
his
body
and
unnerve
him
with
its
tickling
he
regained
his
health
as
thorough
a
banterer
as
before
thinking
life
beautiful
and
not
seeing
why
it
should
not
last
for
ever
as
soon
as
he
could
get
about
without
the
crutches
he
made
longer
walks
often
visiting
construction
jobs
to
see
old
comrades
he
would
stand
with
his
arms
folded
sneering
and
shaking
his
head
ridiculing
the
workers
slaving
at
the
job
stretching
out
his
leg
to
show
them
what
you
got
for
wearing
yourself
out
being
able
to
stand
about
and
mock
others
while
they
were
working
satisfied
his
spite
against
hard
work
no
doubt
he
have
to
go
back
to
it
but
he
put
it
off
as
long
as
possible
he
had
a
reason
now
to
be
lazy
besides
it
seemed
good
to
him
to
loaf
around
like
a
bum
on
the
afternoons
when
coupeau
felt
dull
he
would
call
on
the
lorilleuxs
the
latter
would
pity
him
immensely
and
attract
him
with
all
sorts
of
amiable
attentions
during
the
first
years
following
his
marriage
he
had
avoided
them
thanks
to
gervaise
influence
now
they
regained
their
sway
over
him
by
twitting
him
about
being
afraid
of
his
wife
he
was
no
man
that
was
evident
the
lorilleuxs
however
showed
great
discretion
and
were
loud
in
their
praise
of
the
laundress
good
qualities
coupeau
without
as
yet
coming
to
wrangling
swore
to
the
latter
that
his
sister
adored
her
and
requested
that
she
would
behave
more
amiably
to
her
the
first
quarrel
which
the
couple
had
occurred
one
evening
on
account
of
etienne
the
had
passed
the
afternoon
with
the
lorilleuxs
on
arriving
home
as
the
dinner
was
not
quite
ready
and
the
children
were
whining
for
their
soup
he
suddenly
turned
upon
etienne
and
boxed
his
ears
soundly
and
during
an
hour
he
did
not
cease
to
grumble
the
brat
was
not
his
he
did
not
know
why
he
allowed
him
to
be
in
the
place
he
would
end
by
turning
him
out
into
the
street
up
till
then
he
had
tolerated
the
youngster
without
all
that
fuss
on
the
morrow
he
talked
of
his
dignity
three
days
after
he
kept
kicking
the
little
fellow
morning
and
evening
so
much
so
that
the
child
whenever
he
heard
him
coming
bolted
into
the
goujets
where
the
old
kept
a
corner
of
the
table
clear
for
him
to
do
his
lessons
gervaise
had
for
some
time
past
returned
to
work
she
no
longer
had
the
trouble
of
looking
under
the
glass
cover
of
the
clock
all
the
savings
were
gone
and
she
had
to
work
hard
work
for
four
for
there
were
four
to
feed
now
she
alone
maintained
them
whenever
she
heard
people
pitying
her
she
at
once
found
excuses
for
coupeau
recollect
he
had
suffered
so
much
it
was
not
surprising
if
his
disposition
had
soured
but
it
would
pass
off
when
his
health
returned
and
if
any
one
hinted
that
coupeau
seemed
all
right
again
that
he
could
very
well
return
to
work
she
protested
no
no
not
yet
she
did
not
want
to
see
him
take
to
his
bed
again
they
would
allow
her
to
know
best
what
the
doctor
said
perhaps
it
was
she
who
prevented
him
returning
to
work
telling
him
every
morning
to
take
his
time
and
not
to
force
himself
she
even
slipped
twenty
sou
pieces
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
coupeau
accepted
this
as
something
perfectly
natural
he
was
always
complaining
of
aches
and
pains
so
that
she
would
coddle
him
at
the
end
of
six
months
he
was
still
convalescing
now
whenever
he
went
to
watch
others
working
he
was
always
ready
to
join
his
comrades
in
downing
a
shot
it
was
so
bad
after
all
they
had
their
fun
and
they
never
stayed
more
than
five
minutes
that
could
hurt
anybody
only
a
hypocrite
would
say
he
went
in
because
he
wanted
a
drink
no
wonder
they
had
laughed
at
him
in
the
past
a
glass
of
wine
never
hurt
anybody
he
only
drank
wine
though
never
brandy
wine
never
made
you
sick
did
get
you
drunk
and
helped
you
to
live
longer
soon
though
several
times
after
a
day
of
idleness
in
going
from
one
building
job
to
another
he
came
home
half
drunk
on
those
occasions
gervaise
pretended
to
have
a
terrible
headache
and
kept
their
door
closed
so
that
the
goujets
would
hear
coupeau
drunken
babblings
little
by
little
the
young
woman
lost
her
cheerfulness
morning
and
evening
she
went
to
the
rue
de
la
to
look
at
the
shop
which
was
still
to
be
let
and
she
would
hide
herself
as
though
she
were
committing
some
childish
prank
unworthy
of
a
person
this
shop
was
beginning
to
turn
her
brain
at
when
the
light
was
out
she
experienced
the
charm
of
some
forbidden
pleasure
by
thinking
of
it
with
her
eyes
open
she
again
made
her
calculations
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
for
the
rent
one
hundred
and
fifty
francs
for
utensils
and
moving
one
hundred
francs
in
hand
to
keep
them
going
for
a
fortnight
in
all
five
hundred
francs
at
the
very
lowest
figure
if
she
was
not
continually
thinking
of
it
aloud
it
was
for
fear
she
should
be
suspected
of
regretting
the
savings
swallowed
up
by
coupeau
illness
she
often
became
quite
pale
having
almost
allowed
her
desire
to
escape
her
and
catching
back
her
words
quite
confused
as
though
she
had
been
thinking
of
something
wicked
now
they
would
have
to
work
for
four
or
five
years
before
they
would
succeed
in
saving
such
a
sum
her
regret
was
at
not
being
able
to
start
in
business
at
once
she
would
have
earned
all
the
home
required
without
counting
on
coupeau
letting
him
take
months
to
get
into
the
way
of
work
again
she
would
no
longer
have
been
uneasy
but
certain
of
the
future
and
free
from
the
secret
fears
which
sometimes
seized
her
when
he
returned
home
very
gay
and
singing
and
relating
some
joke
of
that
animal
whom
he
had
treated
to
a
drink
one
evening
gervaise
being
at
home
alone
goujet
entered
and
did
not
hurry
off
again
according
to
his
habit
he
seated
himself
and
smoked
as
he
watched
her
he
probably
had
something
very
serious
to
say
he
thought
it
over
let
it
ripen
without
being
able
to
put
it
into
suitable
words
at
length
after
a
long
silence
he
appeared
to
make
up
his
mind
and
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
to
say
all
in
a
breath
madame
gervaise
will
you
allow
me
to
lend
you
some
money
she
was
leaning
over
an
open
drawer
looking
for
some
she
got
up
her
face
very
red
he
must
have
seen
her
then
in
the
morning
standing
in
ecstacy
before
the
shop
for
close
upon
ten
minutes
he
was
smiling
in
an
embarrassed
way
as
though
he
had
made
some
insulting
proposal
but
she
hastily
refused
never
would
she
accept
money
from
any
one
without
knowing
when
she
would
be
able
to
return
it
then
also
it
was
a
question
of
too
large
an
amount
and
as
he
insisted
in
a
frightened
manner
she
ended
by
exclaiming
but
your
marriage
i
certainly
ca
take
the
money
you
been
saving
for
your
marriage
oh
do
let
that
bother
you
he
replied
turning
red
in
his
turn
i
not
going
to
be
married
now
that
was
just
an
idea
you
know
really
i
would
much
sooner
lend
you
the
money
then
they
both
held
down
their
heads
there
was
something
very
pleasant
between
them
to
which
they
did
not
give
expression
and
gervaise
accepted
goujet
had
told
his
mother
they
crossed
the
landing
and
went
to
see
her
at
once
the
was
very
grave
and
looked
rather
sad
as
she
bent
her
face
over
her
she
would
not
thwart
her
son
but
she
no
longer
approved
gervaise
project
and
she
plainly
told
her
why
coupeau
was
going
to
the
bad
coupeau
would
swallow
up
her
shop
she
especially
could
not
forgive
the
for
having
refused
to
learn
to
read
during
his
convalescence
the
blacksmith
had
offered
to
teach
him
but
the
other
had
sent
him
to
the
right
about
saying
that
learning
made
people
get
thin
this
had
almost
caused
a
quarrel
between
the
two
workmen
each
went
his
own
way
madame
goujet
however
seeing
her
big
boy
beseeching
glances
behaved
very
kindly
to
gervaise
it
was
settled
that
they
would
lend
their
neighbors
five
hundred
francs
the
latter
were
to
repay
the
amount
by
installments
of
twenty
francs
a
month
it
would
last
as
long
as
it
lasted
i
say
the
blacksmith
sweet
on
you
exclaimed
coupeau
laughing
when
he
heard
what
had
taken
place
oh
i
quite
easy
he
too
big
a
muff
we
pay
him
back
his
money
but
really
if
he
had
to
deal
with
some
people
he
find
himself
pretty
well
duped
on
the
morrow
the
coupeaus
took
the
shop
all
day
long
gervaise
was
running
from
rue
neuve
de
la
when
the
neighbors
beheld
her
pass
thus
nimble
and
delighted
to
the
extent
that
she
no
longer
limped
they
said
she
must
have
undergone
some
operation
chapter
it
so
happened
that
the
boches
had
left
the
rue
des
poissonniers
at
the
april
quarter
and
were
now
taking
charge
of
the
great
house
in
the
rue
de
la
it
was
a
curious
coincidence
all
the
same
one
thing
that
worried
gervaise
who
had
lived
so
quietly
in
her
lodgings
in
the
rue
neuve
was
the
thought
of
again
being
under
the
subjection
of
some
unpleasant
person
with
whom
she
would
be
continually
quarrelling
either
on
account
of
water
spilt
in
the
passage
or
of
a
door
shut
too
noisily
at
concierges
are
such
a
disagreeable
class
but
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
be
with
the
boches
they
knew
one
another
they
would
always
get
on
well
together
it
would
be
just
like
members
of
the
same
family
on
the
day
the
coupeaus
went
to
sign
their
lease
gervaise
felt
her
heart
swollen
with
pride
as
she
passed
through
the
high
doorway
she
was
then
at
length
going
to
live
in
that
house
as
vast
as
a
little
town
with
its
interminable
staircases
and
passages
as
long
and
winding
as
streets
she
was
excited
by
everything
the
gray
walls
with
varicolored
rugs
hanging
from
windows
to
dry
in
the
sun
the
dingy
courtyard
with
as
many
holes
in
its
pavement
as
a
public
square
the
hum
of
activity
coming
through
the
walls
she
felt
joy
that
she
was
at
last
about
to
realize
her
ambition
she
also
felt
fear
that
she
would
fail
and
be
crushed
in
the
endless
struggle
against
the
poverty
and
starvation
she
could
feel
breathing
down
her
neck
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
doing
something
very
bold
throwing
herself
into
the
midst
of
some
machinery
in
motion
as
she
listened
to
the
blacksmith
hammers
and
the
cabinetmakers
planes
hammering
and
hissing
in
the
depths
of
the
on
the
ground
floor
on
that
day
the
water
flowing
from
the
dyer
under
the
entrance
porch
was
a
very
pale
apple
green
she
smilingly
stepped
over
it
to
her
the
color
was
a
pleasant
omen
the
meeting
with
the
landlord
was
to
take
place
in
the
boches
room
monsieur
marescot
a
wealthy
cutler
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
had
at
one
time
turned
a
grindstone
through
the
streets
he
was
now
stated
to
be
worth
several
millions
he
was
a
man
of
large
and
even
though
he
now
wore
a
decoration
in
his
his
huge
hands
were
still
those
of
a
former
workingman
it
was
his
joy
to
carry
off
the
scissors
and
knives
of
his
tenants
to
sharpen
them
himself
for
the
fun
of
it
he
often
stayed
for
hours
with
his
concierges
closed
up
in
the
darkness
of
their
lodges
going
over
the
accounts
that
where
he
did
all
his
business
he
was
now
seated
by
madame
boche
kitchen
table
listening
to
her
story
of
how
the
dressmaker
on
the
third
floor
staircase
a
had
used
a
filthy
word
in
refusing
to
pay
her
rent
he
had
had
to
work
precious
hard
once
upon
a
time
but
work
was
the
high
road
to
everything
and
after
counting
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
for
the
first
two
quarters
in
advance
and
dropping
them
into
his
capacious
pocket
he
related
the
story
of
his
life
and
showed
his
decoration
gervaise
however
felt
rather
ill
at
ease
on
account
of
the
behavior
they
pretended
not
to
know
her
they
were
most
assiduous
in
their
attentions
to
the
landlord
bowing
down
before
him
watching
for
his
least
words
and
nodding
their
approval
of
them
madame
boche
suddenly
ran
out
and
dispersed
a
group
of
children
who
were
paddling
about
in
front
of
the
cistern
the
tap
of
which
they
had
turned
full
on
causing
the
water
to
flow
over
the
pavement
and
when
she
returned
upright
and
severe
in
her
skirts
crossing
the
courtyard
and
glancing
slowly
up
at
all
the
windows
as
though
to
assure
herself
of
the
good
behavior
of
the
household
she
pursed
her
lips
in
a
way
to
show
with
what
authority
she
was
invested
now
that
she
reigned
over
three
hundred
tenants
boche
again
spoke
of
the
dressmaker
on
the
second
floor
he
advised
that
she
should
be
turned
out
he
reckoned
up
the
number
of
quarters
she
owed
with
the
importance
of
a
steward
whose
management
might
be
compromised
monsieur
marescot
approved
the
suggestion
of
turning
her
out
but
he
wished
to
wait
till
the
half
quarter
it
was
hard
to
turn
people
out
into
the
street
more
especially
as
it
did
not
put
a
sou
into
the
landlord
pocket
and
gervaise
asked
herself
with
a
shudder
if
she
too
would
be
turned
out
into
the
street
the
day
that
some
misfortune
rendered
her
unable
to
pay
the
concierge
lodge
was
as
dismal
as
a
cellar
black
from
smoke
and
crowded
with
dark
furniture
all
the
sunlight
fell
upon
the
workbench
by
the
window
an
old
frock
coat
that
was
being
reworked
lay
on
it
the
boches
only
child
a
redhead
named
pauline
was
sitting
on
the
floor
staring
quietly
at
the
veal
simmering
on
the
stove
delighted
with
the
sharp
odor
of
cooking
that
came
from
the
frying
pan
monsieur
marescot
again
held
out
his
hand
to
the
when
the
latter
spoke
of
the
repairs
recalling
to
his
mind
a
promise
he
had
made
to
talk
the
matter
over
later
on
but
the
landlord
grew
angry
he
had
never
promised
anything
besides
it
was
not
usual
to
do
any
repairs
to
a
shop
however
he
consented
to
go
over
the
place
followed
by
the
coupeaus
and
boche
the
little
had
carried
off
all
his
shelves
and
counters
the
empty
shop
displayed
its
blackened
ceiling
and
its
cracked
wall
on
which
hung
strips
of
an
old
yellow
paper
in
the
sonorous
emptiness
of
the
place
there
ensued
a
heated
discussion
monsieur
marescot
exclaimed
that
it
was
the
business
of
shopkeepers
to
embellish
their
shops
for
a
shopkeeper
might
wish
to
have
gold
put
about
everywhere
and
he
the
landlord
could
not
put
out
gold
then
he
related
that
he
had
spent
more
than
twenty
thousand
francs
in
fitting
up
his
premises
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
gervaise
with
her
obstinacy
kept
repeating
an
argument
which
she
considered
unanswerable
he
would
repaper
a
lodging
would
he
not
then
why
did
he
not
treat
the
shop
the
same
as
a
lodging
she
did
not
ask
him
for
anything
else
only
to
whitewash
the
ceiling
and
put
some
fresh
paper
on
the
walls
boche
all
this
while
remained
dignified
and
impenetrable
he
turned
about
and
looked
up
in
the
air
without
expressing
an
opinion
coupeau
winked
at
him
in
vain
he
affected
not
to
wish
to
take
advantage
of
his
great
influence
over
the
landlord
he
ended
however
by
making
a
slight
grimace
a
little
smile
accompanied
by
a
nod
of
the
head
just
then
monsieur
marescot
exasperated
and
seemingly
very
unhappy
and
clutching
his
fingers
like
a
miser
being
despoiled
of
his
gold
was
giving
way
to
gervaise
promising
to
do
the
ceiling
and
repaper
the
shop
on
condition
that
she
paid
for
half
of
the
paper
and
he
hurried
away
declining
to
discuss
anything
further
now
that
boche
was
alone
with
the
coupeaus
the
concierge
became
quite
talkative
and
slapped
them
on
the
shoulders
well
well
see
what
they
had
gotten
without
his
help
they
would
never
have
gotten
the
concessions
did
they
notice
how
the
landlord
had
looked
to
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
for
advice
and
how
he
made
up
his
mind
suddenly
when
he
saw
boche
smile
he
confessed
to
them
confidentially
that
he
was
the
real
boss
of
the
building
it
was
he
who
decided
who
got
eviction
notices
and
who
could
become
tenants
he
collected
all
the
rents
and
kept
them
for
a
couple
of
weeks
in
his
bureau
drawer
that
evening
the
coupeaus
to
express
their
gratitude
to
the
boches
sent
them
two
bottles
of
wine
as
a
present
the
following
monday
the
workmen
started
doing
up
the
shop
the
purchasing
of
the
paper
turned
out
especially
to
be
a
very
big
affair
gervaise
wanted
a
grey
paper
with
blue
flowers
so
as
to
enliven
and
brighten
the
walls
boche
offered
to
take
her
to
the
dealers
so
that
she
might
make
her
own
selection
but
the
landlord
had
given
him
formal
instructions
not
to
go
beyond
the
price
of
fifteen
sous
the
piece
they
were
there
an
hour
the
laundress
kept
looking
in
despair
at
a
very
pretty
chintz
pattern
costing
eighteen
sous
the
piece
and
thought
all
the
other
papers
hideous
at
length
the
concierge
gave
in
he
would
arrange
the
matter
and
if
necessary
would
make
out
there
was
a
piece
more
used
than
was
really
the
case
so
on
her
way
home
gervaise
purchased
some
tarts
for
pauline
she
did
not
like
being
behindhand
one
always
gained
by
behaving
nicely
to
her
the
shop
was
to
be
ready
in
four
days
the
workmen
were
there
three
weeks
at
first
it
was
arranged
that
they
should
merely
wash
the
paint
but
this
paint
originally
maroon
was
so
dirty
and
so
that
gervaise
allowed
herself
to
be
tempted
to
have
the
whole
of
the
frontage
painted
a
light
blue
with
yellow
moldings
then
the
repairs
seemed
as
though
they
would
last
for
ever
coupeau
as
he
was
still
not
working
arrived
early
each
morning
to
see
how
things
were
going
boche
left
the
overcoat
or
trousers
on
which
he
was
working
to
come
and
supervise
both
of
them
would
stand
and
watch
with
their
hands
behind
their
backs
puffing
on
their
pipes
the
painters
were
very
merry
fellows
who
would
often
desert
their
work
to
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
and
join
the
discussion
shaking
their
heads
for
hours
admiring
the
work
already
done
the
ceiling
had
been
whitewashed
quickly
but
the
paint
on
the
walls
never
seemed
to
dry
in
a
hurry
around
nine
the
painters
would
arrive
with
their
paint
pots
which
they
stuck
in
a
corner
they
would
look
around
and
then
disappear
perhaps
they
went
to
eat
breakfast
sometimes
coupeau
would
take
everyone
for
a
drink
boche
the
two
painters
and
any
of
friends
who
were
nearby
this
meant
another
afternoon
wasted
gervaise
patience
was
thoroughly
exhausted
when
suddenly
everything
was
finished
in
two
days
the
paint
varnished
the
paper
hung
and
the
dirt
all
cleared
away
the
workmen
had
finished
it
off
as
though
they
were
playing
whistling
away
on
their
ladders
and
singing
loud
enough
to
deafen
the
whole
neighborhood
the
moving
in
took
place
at
once
during
the
first
few
days
gervaise
felt
as
delighted
as
a
child
whenever
she
crossed
the
road
on
returning
from
some
errand
she
lingered
to
smile
at
her
home
from
a
distance
her
shop
appeared
light
and
gay
with
its
pale
blue
signboard
on
which
the
word
laundress
was
painted
in
big
yellow
letters
amidst
the
dark
row
of
the
other
frontages
in
the
window
closed
in
behind
by
little
muslin
curtains
and
hung
on
either
side
with
blue
paper
to
show
off
the
whiteness
of
the
linen
some
shirts
were
displayed
with
some
caps
hanging
above
them
on
wires
she
thought
her
shop
looked
pretty
being
the
same
color
as
the
heavens
inside
there
was
more
blue
the
paper
in
imitation
of
a
pompadour
chintz
represented
a
trellis
overgrown
with
a
huge
table
taking
up
of
the
room
was
her
it
was
covered
with
thick
blanketing
and
draped
with
a
strip
of
cretonne
patterned
with
blue
flower
sprays
that
hid
the
trestles
beneath
gervaise
was
enchanted
with
her
pretty
establishment
and
would
often
seat
herself
on
a
stool
and
sigh
with
contentment
delighted
with
all
the
new
equipment
her
first
glance
always
went
to
the
stove
where
the
irons
were
heated
ten
at
a
time
arranged
over
the
heat
on
slanting
rests
she
would
kneel
down
to
look
into
the
stove
to
make
sure
the
apprentice
had
not
put
in
too
much
coke
the
lodging
at
the
back
of
the
shop
was
quite
decent
the
coupeaus
slept
in
the
first
room
where
they
also
did
the
cooking
and
took
their
meals
a
door
at
the
back
opened
on
to
the
courtyard
of
the
house
nana
bed
was
in
the
right
hand
room
which
was
lighted
by
a
little
round
window
close
to
the
ceiling
as
for
etienne
he
shared
the
left
hand
room
with
the
dirty
clothes
enormous
bundles
of
which
lay
about
on
the
floor
however
there
was
one
disadvantage
the
coupeaus
would
not
admit
it
at
first
but
the
damp
ran
down
the
walls
and
it
was
impossible
to
see
clearly
in
the
place
after
three
in
the
afternoon
in
the
neighborhood
the
new
shop
produced
a
great
sensation
the
coupeaus
were
accused
of
going
too
fast
and
making
too
much
fuss
they
had
in
fact
spent
the
five
hundred
francs
lent
by
the
goujets
in
fitting
up
the
shop
and
in
moving
without
keeping
sufficient
to
live
upon
for
a
fortnight
as
they
had
intended
doing
the
morning
that
gervaise
took
down
her
shutters
for
the
first
time
she
had
just
six
francs
in
her
purse
but
that
did
not
worry
her
customers
began
to
arrive
and
things
seemed
promising
a
week
later
on
the
saturday
before
going
to
bed
she
remained
two
hours
making
calculations
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
she
awoke
coupeau
to
tell
him
with
a
bright
look
on
her
face
that
there
were
hundreds
and
thousands
of
francs
to
be
made
if
they
were
only
careful
ah
well
said
madame
lorilleux
all
over
the
rue
de
la
my
fool
of
a
brother
is
seeing
some
funny
things
all
that
was
wanting
was
that
should
go
about
so
haughty
it
becomes
her
well
does
it
the
lorilleuxs
had
declared
a
feud
to
the
death
against
gervaise
to
begin
with
they
had
almost
died
of
rage
during
the
time
while
the
repairs
were
being
done
to
the
shop
if
they
caught
sight
of
the
painters
from
a
distance
they
would
walk
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
and
go
up
to
their
rooms
with
their
teeth
set
a
blue
shop
for
that
nobody
it
was
enough
to
discourage
all
honest
people
besides
the
second
day
after
the
shop
opened
the
apprentice
happened
to
throw
out
a
bowl
of
starch
just
at
the
moment
when
madame
lorilleux
was
passing
the
sister
caused
a
great
commotion
in
the
street
accusing
her
of
insulting
her
through
her
employees
this
broke
off
all
relations
now
they
only
exchanged
terrible
glares
when
they
encountered
each
other
yes
she
leads
a
pretty
life
madame
lorilleux
kept
saying
we
all
know
where
the
money
came
from
that
she
paid
for
her
wretched
shop
she
borrowed
it
from
the
blacksmith
and
he
springs
from
a
nice
family
too
did
the
father
cut
his
own
throat
to
save
the
guillotine
the
trouble
of
doing
so
anyhow
there
was
something
disreputable
of
that
sort
she
bluntly
accused
gervaise
of
flirting
with
goujet
she
lied
she
pretended
she
had
surprised
them
together
one
night
on
a
seat
on
the
exterior
boulevards
the
thought
of
this
liaison
of
pleasures
that
her
was
no
doubt
enjoying
exasperated
her
still
more
because
of
her
own
ugly
woman
strict
sense
of
propriety
every
day
the
same
cry
came
from
her
heart
to
her
lips
what
does
she
have
that
wretched
cripple
for
people
to
fall
in
love
with
her
why
does
any
one
want
me
she
busied
herself
in
endless
gossiping
among
the
neighbors
she
told
them
the
whole
story
the
day
the
coupeaus
got
married
she
turned
up
her
nose
at
her
oh
she
had
a
keen
nose
she
could
smell
in
advance
how
it
would
turn
out
then
pretended
to
be
so
sweet
what
a
hypocrite
she
and
her
husband
had
only
agreed
to
be
nana
godparents
for
the
sake
of
her
brother
what
a
bundle
it
had
cost
that
fancy
christening
if
were
on
her
deathbed
she
would
give
her
a
glass
of
water
no
matter
how
much
she
begged
she
did
want
anything
to
do
with
such
a
shameless
baggage
little
nana
would
always
be
welcome
when
she
came
up
to
see
her
godparents
the
child
could
be
blamed
for
her
mother
sins
but
there
was
no
use
trying
to
tell
coupeau
anything
any
real
man
in
his
situation
would
have
beaten
his
wife
and
put
a
stop
to
it
all
all
they
wanted
was
for
him
to
insist
on
respect
for
his
family
if
she
madame
lorilleux
had
acted
like
that
coupeau
would
be
so
complacent
he
would
have
stabbed
her
for
sure
with
his
shears
the
boches
however
who
sternly
disapproved
of
quarrels
in
their
building
said
that
the
lorilleuxs
were
in
the
wrong
the
lorilleuxs
were
no
doubt
respectable
persons
quiet
working
the
whole
day
long
and
paying
their
rent
regularly
but
really
jealousy
had
driven
them
mad
and
they
were
mean
enough
to
skin
an
egg
real
misers
they
were
so
stingy
that
they
hide
their
bottle
when
any
one
came
in
so
as
not
to
have
to
offer
a
glass
of
wine
not
regular
people
at
all
gervaise
had
brought
over
cassis
and
soda
water
one
day
to
drink
with
the
boches
when
madame
lorilleux
went
by
she
acted
out
spitting
before
the
concierge
door
well
after
that
when
madame
boche
swept
the
corridors
on
saturdays
she
always
left
a
pile
of
trash
before
the
lorilleuxs
door
it
is
to
be
wondered
at
madame
lorilleux
would
exclaim
always
stuffing
them
the
gluttons
ah
they
all
alike
but
they
had
better
not
annoy
me
i
complain
to
the
landlord
only
yesterday
i
saw
that
sly
old
boche
chasing
after
madame
skirts
just
fancy
a
woman
of
that
age
and
who
has
half
a
dozen
children
too
it
positively
disgusting
if
i
catch
them
at
anything
of
the
sort
again
i
tell
madame
boche
and
she
give
them
both
a
hiding
it
be
something
to
laugh
at
mother
coupeau
continued
to
visit
the
two
houses
agreeing
with
everybody
and
even
managing
to
get
asked
oftener
to
dinner
by
complaisantly
listening
one
night
to
her
daughter
and
the
next
night
to
her
however
madame
lerat
did
not
go
to
visit
the
coupeaus
because
she
had
argued
with
gervaise
about
a
zouave
who
had
cut
the
nose
of
his
mistress
with
a
razor
she
was
on
the
side
of
the
zouave
saying
it
was
evidence
of
a
great
passion
but
without
explaining
further
her
thought
then
she
had
made
madame
lorilleux
even
more
angry
by
telling
her
that
had
called
her
cow
tail
in
front
of
fifteen
or
twenty
people
yes
that
what
the
boches
and
all
the
neighbors
called
her
now
cow
tail
gervaise
remained
calm
and
cheerful
among
all
these
she
often
stood
by
the
door
of
her
shop
greeting
friends
who
passed
by
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
it
was
her
pleasure
to
take
a
moment
between
batches
of
ironing
to
enjoy
the
street
and
take
pride
in
her
own
stretch
of
sidewalk
she
felt
that
the
rue
de
la
goutte
was
hers
and
the
neighboring
streets
and
the
whole
neighborhood
as
she
stood
there
with
her
blonde
hair
slightly
damp
from
the
heat
of
the
shop
she
would
look
left
and
right
taking
in
the
people
the
buildings
and
the
sky
to
the
left
rue
de
la
goutte
was
peaceful
and
almost
empty
like
a
country
town
with
women
idling
in
their
doorways
while
to
the
right
only
a
short
distance
away
rue
des
poissonniers
had
a
noisy
throng
of
people
and
vehicles
the
stretch
of
gutter
before
her
own
shop
became
very
important
in
her
mind
it
was
like
a
wide
river
which
she
longed
to
see
neat
and
clean
it
was
a
lively
river
colored
by
the
dye
shop
with
the
most
fanciful
of
hues
which
contrasted
with
the
black
mud
beside
it
then
there
were
the
shops
a
large
grocery
with
a
display
of
dried
fruits
protected
by
mesh
nets
a
shop
selling
work
clothes
which
had
white
tunics
and
blue
smocks
hanging
before
it
with
arms
that
waved
at
the
slightest
breeze
cats
were
purring
on
the
counters
of
the
fruit
store
and
the
tripe
shop
madame
vigouroux
the
coal
dealer
next
door
returned
her
greetings
she
was
a
plump
short
woman
with
bright
eyes
in
a
dark
face
who
was
always
joking
with
the
men
while
standing
at
her
doorway
her
shop
was
decorated
in
imitation
of
a
rustic
chalet
the
neighbors
on
the
other
side
were
a
mother
and
daughter
the
cudorges
the
umbrella
sellers
kept
their
door
closed
and
never
came
out
to
visit
gervaise
always
looked
across
the
road
too
through
the
wide
carriage
entrance
of
the
windowless
wall
opposite
her
at
the
blacksmith
forge
the
courtyard
was
cluttered
with
vans
and
carts
inscribed
on
the
wall
was
the
word
blacksmith
at
the
lower
end
of
the
wall
between
the
small
shops
selling
scrap
iron
and
fried
potatoes
was
a
watchmaker
he
wore
a
frock
coat
and
was
always
very
neat
his
cuckoo
clocks
could
be
heard
in
chorus
against
the
background
noise
of
the
street
and
the
blacksmith
rhythmic
clanging
the
neighborhood
in
general
thought
gervaise
very
nice
there
was
it
is
true
a
good
deal
of
scandal
related
regarding
her
but
everyone
admired
her
large
eyes
small
mouth
and
beautiful
white
teeth
in
short
she
was
a
pretty
blonde
and
had
it
not
been
for
her
crippled
leg
she
might
have
ranked
amongst
the
comeliest
she
was
now
in
her
year
and
had
grown
considerably
plumper
her
fine
features
were
becoming
puffy
and
her
gestures
were
assuming
a
pleasant
indolence
at
times
she
occasionally
seemed
to
forget
herself
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
whilst
she
waited
for
her
iron
to
heat
smiling
vaguely
and
with
an
expression
of
greedy
joy
upon
her
face
she
was
becoming
fond
of
good
living
everybody
said
so
but
that
was
not
a
very
grave
fault
but
rather
the
contrary
when
one
earns
sufficient
to
be
able
to
buy
good
food
one
would
be
foolish
to
eat
potato
parings
all
the
more
so
as
she
continued
to
work
very
hard
slaving
to
please
her
customers
sitting
up
late
at
night
after
the
place
was
closed
whenever
there
was
anything
urgent
she
was
lucky
as
all
her
neighbors
said
everything
prospered
with
her
she
did
the
washing
for
all
the
house
madinier
mademoiselle
remanjou
the
boches
she
even
secured
some
of
the
customers
of
her
old
employer
madame
fauconnier
parisian
ladies
living
in
the
rue
du
as
early
as
the
third
week
she
was
obliged
to
engage
two
workwomen
madame
putois
and
tall
clemence
the
girl
who
used
to
live
on
the
sixth
floor
counting
her
apprentice
that
little
augustine
who
was
as
ugly
as
a
beggar
behind
that
made
three
persons
in
her
employ
others
would
certainly
have
lost
their
heads
at
such
a
piece
of
good
fortune
it
was
excusable
for
her
to
slack
a
little
on
monday
after
drudging
all
through
the
week
besides
it
was
necessary
to
her
she
would
have
had
no
courage
left
and
would
have
expected
to
see
the
shirts
iron
themselves
if
she
had
not
been
able
to
dress
up
in
some
pretty
thing
gervaise
was
always
so
amiable
meek
as
a
lamb
sweet
as
sugar
there
was
any
one
she
disliked
except
madame
lorilleux
while
she
was
enjoying
a
good
meal
and
coffee
she
could
be
indulgent
and
forgive
everybody
saying
we
have
to
forgive
each
other
do
we
unless
we
want
to
live
like
savages
had
all
her
dreams
come
true
she
remembered
her
old
dream
to
have
a
job
enough
bread
to
eat
and
a
corner
in
which
to
sleep
to
bring
up
her
children
not
to
be
beaten
and
to
die
in
her
own
bed
she
had
everything
she
wanted
now
and
more
than
she
had
ever
expected
she
laughed
thinking
of
delaying
dying
in
her
own
bed
as
long
as
possible
it
was
to
coupeau
especially
that
gervaise
behaved
nicely
never
an
angry
word
never
a
complaint
behind
her
husband
back
the
had
at
length
resumed
work
and
as
the
job
he
was
engaged
on
was
at
the
other
side
of
paris
she
gave
him
every
morning
forty
sous
for
his
luncheon
his
glass
of
wine
and
his
tobacco
only
two
days
out
of
every
six
coupeau
would
stop
on
the
way
spend
the
forty
sous
in
drink
with
a
friend
and
return
home
to
lunch
with
some
story
once
even
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
go
far
he
treated
himself
and
three
others
to
a
regular
feast
snails
roast
meat
and
some
sealed
bottles
of
wine
at
the
capuchin
on
the
barriere
de
la
chapelle
then
as
his
forty
sous
were
not
sufficient
he
had
sent
the
waiter
to
his
wife
with
the
bill
and
the
information
that
he
was
in
pawn
she
laughed
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
where
was
the
harm
if
her
old
man
amused
himself
a
bit
you
must
give
men
a
long
rein
if
you
want
to
live
peaceably
at
home
from
one
word
to
another
one
soon
arrived
at
blows
it
was
easy
to
understand
coupeau
still
suffered
from
his
leg
besides
he
was
led
astray
he
was
obliged
to
do
as
the
others
did
or
else
he
would
be
thought
a
cheap
skate
and
it
was
really
a
matter
of
no
consequence
if
he
came
home
a
bit
elevated
he
went
to
bed
and
two
hours
afterwards
he
was
all
right
again
it
was
now
the
warm
time
of
the
year
one
june
afternoon
a
saturday
when
there
was
a
lot
of
work
to
get
through
gervaise
herself
had
piled
the
coke
into
the
stove
around
which
ten
irons
were
heating
whilst
a
rumbling
sound
issued
from
the
chimney
at
that
hour
the
sun
was
shining
full
on
the
shop
front
and
the
pavement
reflected
the
heat
waves
causing
all
sorts
of
quaint
shadows
to
dance
over
the
ceiling
and
that
blaze
of
light
which
assumed
a
bluish
tinge
from
the
color
of
the
paper
on
the
shelves
and
against
the
window
was
almost
blinding
in
the
intensity
with
which
it
shone
over
the
like
a
golden
dust
shaken
among
the
fine
linen
the
atmosphere
was
stifling
the
shop
door
was
thrown
wide
open
but
not
a
breath
of
air
entered
the
clothes
which
were
hung
up
on
brass
wires
to
dry
steamed
and
became
as
stiff
as
shavings
in
less
than
three
quarters
of
an
hour
for
some
little
while
past
an
oppressive
silence
had
reigned
in
that
heat
interrupted
only
by
the
smothered
sound
of
the
banging
down
of
the
irons
on
the
thick
blanket
covered
with
calico
ah
well
said
gervaise
it
enough
to
melt
one
we
might
have
to
take
off
our
chemises
she
was
sitting
on
the
floor
in
front
of
a
basin
starching
some
things
her
sleeves
were
rolled
up
and
her
camisole
was
slipping
down
her
shoulders
little
curls
of
golden
hair
were
stuck
to
her
skin
by
perspiration
she
carefully
dipped
caps
entire
petticoats
and
the
trimmings
of
women
drawers
into
the
milky
water
then
she
rolled
the
things
up
and
placed
them
at
the
bottom
of
a
square
basket
after
dipping
her
hand
in
a
pail
and
shaking
it
over
the
portions
of
the
shirts
and
drawers
which
she
had
not
starched
this
basketful
for
you
madame
putois
she
said
look
sharp
now
it
dries
at
once
and
will
want
doing
all
over
again
in
an
hour
madame
putois
a
thin
little
woman
of
was
ironing
though
she
was
buttoned
up
in
an
old
dress
there
was
not
a
drop
of
perspiration
to
be
seen
she
had
not
even
taken
her
cap
off
a
black
cap
trimmed
with
green
ribbons
turned
partly
yellow
and
she
stood
perfectly
upright
in
front
of
the
which
was
too
high
for
her
sticking
out
her
elbows
and
moving
her
iron
with
the
jerky
evolutions
of
a
puppet
on
a
sudden
she
exclaimed
ah
no
mademoiselle
clemence
you
must
take
your
camisole
off
you
know
i
do
like
such
indecencies
whilst
you
about
it
you
better
show
everything
there
already
three
men
over
the
way
stopping
to
look
tall
clemence
called
her
an
old
beast
between
her
teeth
she
was
suffocating
she
might
certainly
make
herself
comfortable
everyone
was
not
gifted
with
a
skin
as
dry
as
touchwood
besides
no
one
could
see
anything
and
she
held
up
her
arms
whilst
her
opulent
bosom
almost
ripped
her
chemise
and
her
shoulders
were
bursting
through
the
straps
at
the
rate
she
was
going
clemence
was
not
likely
to
have
any
marrow
left
in
her
bones
long
before
she
was
thirty
years
old
mornings
after
big
parties
she
was
unable
to
feel
the
ground
she
trod
upon
and
fell
asleep
over
her
work
whilst
her
head
and
her
stomach
seemed
as
though
stuffed
full
of
rags
but
she
was
kept
on
all
the
same
for
no
other
workwoman
could
iron
a
shirt
with
her
style
shirts
were
her
specialty
this
is
mine
is
it
she
declared
tapping
her
bosom
and
it
does
bite
it
hurts
nobody
clemence
put
your
wrapper
on
again
said
gervaise
madame
putois
is
right
it
is
decent
people
will
begin
to
take
my
house
for
what
it
is
so
tall
clemence
dressed
herself
again
grumbling
the
while
dieu
there
prudery
for
you
and
she
vented
her
rage
on
the
apprentice
that
augustine
who
was
ironing
some
stockings
and
handkerchiefs
beside
her
she
jostled
her
and
pushed
her
with
her
elbow
but
augustine
who
was
of
a
surly
disposition
and
slyly
spiteful
in
the
way
of
an
animal
and
a
drudge
spat
on
the
back
of
the
other
dress
just
out
of
revenge
without
being
seen
gervaise
during
this
incident
had
commenced
a
cap
belonging
to
madame
boche
which
she
intended
to
take
great
pains
with
she
had
prepared
some
boiled
starch
to
make
it
look
new
again
she
was
gently
passing
a
little
iron
rounded
at
both
ends
over
the
inside
of
the
crown
of
the
cap
when
a
woman
entered
the
shop
her
face
covered
with
red
blotches
and
her
skirts
sopping
wet
it
was
a
washerwoman
who
employed
three
assistants
at
the
in
the
rue
de
la
you
come
too
soon
madame
bijard
cried
gervaise
i
told
you
to
call
this
evening
i
too
busy
to
attend
to
you
now
but
as
the
washerwoman
began
lamenting
and
fearing
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
put
all
the
things
to
soak
that
day
she
consented
to
give
her
the
dirty
clothes
at
once
they
went
to
fetch
the
bundles
in
the
left
hand
room
where
etienne
slept
and
returned
with
enormous
armfuls
which
they
piled
up
on
the
floor
at
the
back
of
the
shop
the
sorting
lasted
a
good
half
hour
gervaise
made
heaps
all
round
her
throwing
the
shirts
in
one
the
chemises
in
another
the
handkerchiefs
the
socks
the
in
others
whenever
she
came
across
anything
belonging
to
a
new
customer
she
marked
it
with
a
cross
in
red
cotton
thread
so
as
to
know
it
again
and
from
all
this
dirty
linen
which
they
were
throwing
about
there
issued
an
offensive
odor
in
the
warm
atmosphere
oh
la
la
what
a
stench
said
clemence
holding
her
nose
of
course
there
is
if
it
were
clean
they
would
send
it
to
us
quietly
explained
gervaise
it
smells
as
one
would
expect
it
to
all
we
said
fourteen
chemises
did
we
madame
bijard
fifteen
sixteen
seventeen
and
she
continued
counting
aloud
used
to
this
kind
of
thing
she
evinced
no
disgust
she
thrust
her
bare
pink
arms
deep
into
the
piles
of
laundry
shirts
yellow
with
grime
towels
stiff
from
dirty
dish
water
socks
threadbare
and
eaten
away
by
sweat
the
strong
odor
which
slapped
her
in
the
face
as
she
sorted
the
piles
of
clothes
made
her
feel
drowsy
she
seemed
to
be
intoxicating
herself
with
this
stench
of
humanity
as
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
stool
bending
far
over
smiling
vaguely
her
eyes
slightly
misty
it
was
as
if
her
laziness
was
started
by
a
kind
of
smothering
caused
by
the
dirty
clothes
which
poisoned
the
air
in
the
shop
just
as
she
was
shaking
out
a
child
dirty
diaper
coupeau
came
in
by
jove
he
stuttered
what
a
sun
it
shines
full
on
your
head
the
caught
hold
of
the
to
save
himself
from
falling
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
so
drunk
until
then
he
had
sometimes
come
home
slightly
tipsy
but
nothing
more
this
time
however
he
had
a
black
eye
just
a
friendly
slap
he
had
run
up
against
in
a
playful
moment
his
curly
hair
already
streaked
with
grey
must
have
dusted
a
corner
in
some
low
wineshop
for
a
cobweb
was
hanging
to
one
of
his
locks
over
the
back
of
his
neck
he
was
still
as
attractive
as
ever
though
his
features
were
rather
drawn
and
aged
and
his
under
jaw
projected
more
but
he
was
always
lively
as
he
would
sometimes
say
with
a
complexion
to
be
envied
by
a
duchess
i
just
explain
it
to
you
he
resumed
addressing
gervaise
it
was
you
know
him
the
bloke
with
a
wooden
leg
well
as
he
was
going
back
to
his
native
place
he
wanted
to
treat
us
oh
we
were
all
right
if
it
had
been
for
that
devil
of
a
sun
in
the
street
everybody
looks
shaky
really
all
the
world
drunk
and
as
tall
clemence
laughed
at
his
thinking
that
the
people
in
the
street
were
drunk
he
was
himself
seized
with
an
intense
fit
of
gaiety
which
almost
strangled
him
look
at
them
the
blessed
tipplers
are
they
funny
he
cried
but
it
not
their
fault
it
the
sun
that
causing
it
all
the
shop
laughed
even
madame
putois
who
did
not
like
drunkards
that
augustine
was
cackling
like
a
hen
suffocating
with
her
mouth
wide
open
gervaise
however
suspected
coupeau
of
not
having
come
straight
home
but
of
having
passed
an
hour
with
the
lorilleuxs
who
were
always
filling
his
head
with
unpleasant
ideas
when
he
swore
he
had
not
been
near
them
she
laughed
also
full
of
indulgence
and
not
even
reproaching
him
with
having
wasted
another
day
dieu
what
nonsense
he
does
talk
she
murmured
how
does
he
manage
to
say
such
stupid
things
then
in
a
maternal
tone
of
voice
she
added
now
go
to
bed
wo
you
you
see
we
busy
you
in
our
way
that
makes
handkerchiefs
madame
bijard
and
two
more
but
coupeau
was
not
sleepy
he
stood
there
wagging
his
body
from
side
to
side
like
the
pendulum
of
a
clock
and
chuckling
in
an
obstinate
and
teasing
manner
gervaise
wanting
to
finish
with
madame
bijard
called
to
clemence
to
count
the
laundry
while
she
made
the
list
tall
clemence
made
a
dirty
remark
about
every
item
that
she
touched
she
commented
on
the
customers
misfortunes
and
their
bedroom
adventures
she
had
a
joke
for
every
rip
or
stain
that
passed
through
her
hands
augustine
pretended
that
she
did
understand
but
her
ears
were
wide
open
madame
putois
compressed
her
lips
thinking
it
a
disgrace
to
say
such
things
in
front
of
coupeau
it
not
a
man
business
to
have
anything
to
do
with
dirty
linen
it
just
not
done
among
decent
people
gervaise
serious
and
her
mind
fully
occupied
with
what
she
was
about
did
not
seem
to
notice
as
she
wrote
she
gave
a
glance
to
each
article
as
it
passed
before
her
so
as
to
recognize
it
and
she
never
made
a
mistake
she
guessed
the
owner
name
just
by
the
look
or
the
color
those
napkins
belonged
to
the
goujets
that
was
evident
they
had
not
been
used
to
wipe
out
that
certainly
came
from
the
boches
on
account
of
the
pomatum
with
which
madame
boche
always
smeared
her
things
there
was
no
need
to
put
your
nose
close
to
the
flannel
vests
of
monsieur
madinier
his
skin
was
so
oily
that
it
clogged
up
his
woolens
she
knew
many
peculiarities
the
cleanliness
of
some
the
ragged
underclothes
of
neighborhood
ladies
who
appeared
on
the
streets
in
silk
dresses
how
many
items
each
family
soiled
weekly
the
way
some
garments
were
always
torn
at
the
same
spot
oh
she
had
many
tales
to
tell
for
instance
the
chemises
of
mademoiselle
remanjou
provided
material
for
endless
comments
they
wore
out
at
the
top
first
because
the
old
maid
had
bony
sharp
shoulders
and
they
were
never
really
dirty
proving
that
you
dry
up
by
her
age
like
a
stick
of
wood
out
of
which
it
hard
to
squeeze
a
drop
of
anything
it
was
thus
that
at
every
sorting
of
the
dirty
linen
in
the
shop
they
undressed
the
whole
neighborhood
of
the
oh
here
something
luscious
cried
clemence
opening
another
bundle
gervaise
suddenly
seized
with
a
great
repugnance
drew
back
madame
gaudron
bundle
said
she
i
no
longer
wash
for
her
find
some
excuse
no
i
not
more
particular
than
another
i
handled
some
most
disgusting
linen
in
my
time
but
really
that
lot
i
stomach
what
can
the
woman
do
to
get
her
things
into
such
a
state
and
she
requested
clemence
to
look
sharp
but
the
girl
continued
her
remarks
thrusting
the
clothes
sullenly
about
her
with
complaints
on
the
soiled
caps
she
waved
like
triumphal
banners
of
filth
meanwhile
the
heaps
around
gervaise
had
grown
higher
still
seated
on
the
edge
of
the
stool
she
was
now
disappearing
between
the
petticoats
and
chemises
in
front
of
her
were
the
sheets
the
table
cloths
a
veritable
mass
of
dirtiness
she
seemed
even
rosier
and
more
languid
than
usual
within
this
spreading
sea
of
soiled
laundry
she
had
regained
her
composure
forgetting
madame
gaudron
laundry
stirring
the
various
piles
of
clothing
to
make
sure
there
had
been
no
mistake
in
sorting
augustine
had
just
stuffed
the
stove
so
full
of
coke
that
its
sides
were
bright
red
the
sun
was
shining
obliquely
on
the
window
the
shop
was
in
a
blaze
then
coupeau
whom
the
great
heat
intoxicated
all
the
more
was
seized
with
a
sudden
fit
of
tenderness
he
advanced
towards
gervaise
with
open
arms
and
deeply
moved
you
a
good
wife
he
stammered
i
must
kiss
you
but
he
caught
his
foot
in
the
garments
which
barred
the
way
and
nearly
fell
what
a
nuisance
you
are
said
gervaise
without
getting
angry
keep
still
we
nearly
done
now
no
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
he
must
do
so
because
he
loved
her
so
much
whilst
he
stuttered
he
tried
to
get
round
the
heap
of
petticoats
and
stumbled
against
the
pile
of
chemises
then
as
he
obstinately
persisted
his
feet
caught
together
and
he
fell
flat
his
nose
in
the
midst
of
the
gervaise
beginning
to
lose
her
temper
pushed
him
saying
that
he
was
mixing
all
the
things
up
but
clemence
and
even
madame
putois
maintained
that
she
was
wrong
it
was
very
nice
of
him
after
all
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
she
might
very
well
let
herself
be
kissed
you
lucky
you
are
madame
coupeau
said
madame
bijard
whose
drunkard
of
a
husband
a
locksmith
was
nearly
beating
her
to
death
each
evening
when
he
came
in
if
my
old
man
was
like
that
when
he
had
a
drop
it
would
be
a
real
pleasure
gervaise
had
calmed
down
and
was
already
regretting
her
hastiness
she
helped
coupeau
up
on
his
legs
again
then
she
offered
her
cheek
with
a
smile
but
the
without
caring
a
button
for
the
other
people
being
present
seized
her
bosom
it
not
for
the
sake
of
saying
so
he
murmured
but
your
dirty
linen
stinks
tremendously
still
i
love
you
all
the
same
you
know
leave
off
you
tickling
me
cried
she
laughing
the
louder
what
a
great
silly
you
are
how
can
you
be
so
absurd
he
had
caught
hold
of
her
and
would
not
let
her
go
she
gradually
abandoned
herself
to
him
dizzy
from
the
slight
faintness
caused
by
the
heap
of
clothes
and
not
minding
coupeau
breath
the
long
kiss
they
exchanged
on
each
other
mouths
in
the
midst
of
the
filth
of
the
laundress
trade
was
perhaps
the
first
tumble
in
the
slow
downfall
of
their
life
together
madame
bijard
had
meanwhile
been
tying
the
laundry
up
into
bundles
and
talking
about
her
daughter
eulalie
who
at
two
was
as
smart
as
a
grown
woman
she
could
be
left
by
herself
she
never
cried
or
played
with
matches
finally
madame
bijard
took
the
laundry
away
a
bundle
at
a
time
her
face
splotched
with
purple
and
her
tall
form
bent
under
the
weight
this
heat
is
becoming
unbearable
we
roasting
said
gervaise
wiping
her
face
before
returning
to
madame
boche
cap
they
talked
of
boxing
augustine
ears
when
they
saw
that
the
stove
was
the
irons
also
were
getting
in
the
same
condition
she
must
have
the
very
devil
in
her
body
one
could
not
turn
one
back
a
moment
without
her
being
up
to
some
of
her
tricks
now
they
would
have
to
wait
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
they
would
be
able
to
use
their
irons
gervaise
covered
the
fire
with
two
shovelfuls
of
cinders
then
she
thought
to
hang
some
sheets
on
the
brass
wires
near
the
ceiling
to
serve
as
curtains
to
keep
out
the
sunlight
things
were
now
better
in
the
shop
the
temperature
was
still
high
but
you
could
imagine
it
was
cooler
footsteps
could
still
be
heard
outside
but
you
were
free
to
make
yourself
comfortable
clemence
removed
her
camisole
again
coupeau
still
refused
to
go
to
bed
so
they
allowed
him
to
stay
but
he
had
to
promise
to
be
quiet
in
a
corner
for
they
were
very
busy
whatever
has
that
vermin
done
with
my
little
iron
murmured
gervaise
speaking
of
augustine
they
were
for
ever
seeking
the
little
iron
which
they
found
in
the
most
places
where
the
apprentice
so
they
said
hid
it
out
of
spite
gervaise
could
now
finish
madame
boche
cap
first
she
roughly
smoothed
the
lace
spreading
it
out
with
her
hand
and
then
she
straightened
it
up
by
light
strokes
of
the
iron
it
had
a
very
fancy
border
consisting
of
narrow
puffs
alternating
with
insertions
of
embroidery
she
was
working
on
it
silently
and
conscientiously
ironing
the
puffs
and
insertions
silence
prevailed
for
a
time
nothing
was
to
be
heard
except
the
soft
thud
of
irons
on
the
ironing
pad
on
both
sides
of
the
huge
rectangular
table
gervaise
her
two
employees
and
the
apprentice
were
bending
over
slaving
at
their
tasks
with
rounded
shoulders
their
arms
moving
incessantly
each
had
a
flat
brick
blackened
by
hot
irons
near
her
a
soup
plate
filled
with
clean
water
was
on
the
middle
of
the
table
with
a
moistening
rag
and
a
small
brush
soaking
in
it
a
bouquet
of
large
white
lilies
bloomed
in
what
had
once
been
a
brandied
cherry
jar
its
cluster
of
snowy
flowers
suggested
a
corner
of
a
royal
garden
madame
putois
had
begun
the
basket
that
gervaise
had
brought
to
her
filled
with
towels
wrappers
cuffs
and
underdrawers
augustine
was
dawdling
with
the
stockings
and
washcloths
gazing
into
the
air
seemingly
fascinated
by
a
large
fly
that
was
buzzing
around
clemence
had
done
men
shirts
so
far
that
day
always
wine
never
spirits
suddenly
said
the
who
felt
the
necessity
of
making
this
declaration
spirits
make
me
drunk
have
none
of
them
clemence
took
an
iron
from
the
stove
with
her
leather
holder
in
which
a
piece
of
sheet
iron
was
inserted
and
held
it
up
to
her
cheek
to
see
how
hot
it
was
she
rubbed
it
on
her
brick
wiped
it
on
a
piece
of
rag
hanging
from
her
and
started
on
her
shirt
first
of
all
ironing
the
shoulders
and
the
sleeves
bah
monsieur
coupeau
said
she
after
a
minute
or
two
a
little
glass
of
brandy
is
bad
it
sets
me
going
besides
the
sooner
you
merry
the
jollier
it
is
oh
i
do
make
any
mistake
i
know
that
i
make
old
bones
what
a
nuisance
you
are
with
your
funeral
ideas
interrupted
madame
putois
who
did
not
like
hearing
people
talk
of
anything
sad
coupeau
had
arisen
and
was
becoming
angry
thinking
that
he
had
been
accused
of
drinking
brandy
he
swore
on
his
own
head
and
on
the
heads
of
his
wife
and
child
that
there
was
not
a
drop
of
brandy
in
his
veins
and
he
went
up
to
clemence
and
blew
in
her
face
so
that
she
might
smell
his
breath
then
he
began
to
giggle
because
her
bare
shoulders
were
right
under
his
nose
he
thought
maybe
he
could
see
more
clemence
having
folded
over
the
back
of
the
shirt
and
ironed
it
on
both
sides
was
now
working
on
the
cuffs
and
collar
however
as
he
was
shoving
against
her
he
caused
her
to
make
a
wrinkle
obliging
her
to
reach
for
the
brush
soaking
in
the
soup
plate
to
smooth
it
out
madame
said
she
do
make
him
leave
off
bothering
me
leave
her
alone
it
stupid
of
you
to
go
on
like
that
quietly
observed
gervaise
we
in
a
hurry
do
you
hear
they
were
in
a
hurry
well
what
it
was
not
his
fault
he
was
doing
no
harm
he
was
not
touching
he
was
only
looking
was
it
no
longer
allowed
to
look
at
the
beautiful
things
that
god
had
made
all
the
same
she
had
precious
fine
arms
that
artful
clemence
she
might
exhibit
herself
for
two
sous
and
nobody
would
have
to
regret
his
money
the
girl
allowed
him
to
go
on
laughing
at
these
coarse
compliments
of
a
drunken
man
and
she
soon
commenced
joking
with
him
he
chuffed
her
about
the
shirts
so
she
was
always
doing
shirts
why
yes
she
practically
lived
in
them
dieu
she
knew
them
pretty
well
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
had
passed
through
her
hands
just
about
every
man
in
the
neighborhood
was
wearing
her
handiwork
on
his
body
her
shoulders
were
shaking
with
laughter
through
all
this
but
she
managed
to
continue
ironing
that
the
banter
said
she
laughing
harder
than
ever
that
augustine
almost
burst
the
joke
seemed
to
her
so
funny
the
others
bullied
her
there
was
a
brat
for
you
who
laughed
at
words
she
ought
not
to
understand
clemence
handed
her
her
iron
the
apprentice
finished
up
the
irons
on
the
stockings
and
the
when
they
were
not
hot
enough
for
the
starched
things
but
she
took
hold
of
this
one
so
clumsily
that
she
made
herself
a
cuff
in
the
form
of
a
long
burn
on
the
wrist
and
she
sobbed
and
accused
clemence
of
having
burnt
her
on
purpose
the
latter
who
had
gone
to
fetch
a
very
hot
iron
for
the
consoled
her
at
once
by
threatening
to
iron
her
two
ears
if
she
did
not
leave
off
then
she
placed
a
piece
of
flannel
under
the
front
and
slowly
passed
the
iron
over
it
giving
the
starch
time
to
show
up
and
dry
the
became
as
stiff
and
as
shiny
as
cardboard
by
golly
swore
coupeau
who
was
treading
behind
her
with
the
obstinacy
of
a
drunkard
he
raised
himself
up
with
a
shrill
laugh
that
resembled
a
pulley
in
want
of
grease
clemence
leaning
heavily
over
the
her
wrists
bent
in
her
elbows
sticking
out
and
wide
apart
was
bending
her
neck
in
a
last
effort
and
all
her
muscles
swelled
her
shoulders
rose
with
the
slow
play
of
the
muscles
beating
beneath
the
soft
skin
her
breasts
heaved
wet
with
perspiration
in
the
rosy
shadow
of
the
half
open
chemise
then
coupeau
thrust
out
his
hands
trying
to
touch
her
bare
flesh
madame
madame
cried
clemence
do
make
him
leave
off
i
shall
go
away
if
it
continues
i
wo
be
intimated
gervaise
glanced
over
just
as
her
husband
hands
began
to
explore
inside
the
chemise
really
coupeau
you
too
foolish
said
she
with
a
vexed
air
as
though
she
were
scolding
a
child
who
persisted
in
eating
his
jam
without
bread
you
must
go
to
bed
yes
go
to
bed
monsieur
coupeau
it
will
be
far
better
exclaimed
madame
putois
ah
well
stuttered
he
without
ceasing
to
chuckle
you
all
precious
particular
so
one
must
amuse
oneself
now
women
i
know
how
to
handle
them
i
only
kiss
them
no
more
one
admires
a
lady
you
know
and
wants
to
show
it
and
besides
when
one
displays
one
goods
it
that
one
may
make
one
choice
is
it
why
does
the
tall
blonde
show
everything
she
got
it
not
decent
and
turning
towards
clemence
he
added
you
know
my
lovely
wrong
to
be
to
very
insolent
if
it
because
there
are
others
here
but
he
was
unable
to
continue
gervaise
very
calmly
seized
hold
of
him
with
one
hand
and
placed
the
other
on
his
mouth
he
struggled
just
by
way
of
a
joke
whilst
she
pushed
him
to
the
back
of
the
shop
towards
the
bedroom
he
got
his
mouth
free
and
said
that
he
was
willing
to
go
to
bed
but
that
the
tall
blonde
must
come
and
warm
his
feet
then
gervaise
could
be
heard
taking
off
his
shoes
she
removed
his
clothes
too
bullying
him
in
a
motherly
way
he
burst
out
laughing
after
she
had
removed
his
trousers
and
kicked
about
pretending
that
she
was
tickling
him
at
last
she
tucked
him
in
carefully
like
a
child
was
he
comfortable
now
but
he
did
not
answer
he
called
to
clemence
i
say
my
lovely
i
here
and
waiting
for
you
when
gervaise
went
back
into
the
shop
the
augustine
was
being
properly
chastised
by
clemence
because
of
a
dirty
iron
that
madame
putois
had
used
and
which
had
caused
her
to
soil
a
camisole
clemence
in
defending
herself
for
not
having
cleaned
her
iron
blamed
augustine
swearing
that
it
was
hers
in
spite
of
the
spot
of
burned
starch
still
clinging
to
the
bottom
the
apprentice
outraged
at
the
injustice
openly
spat
on
the
front
of
clemence
dress
earning
a
slap
for
her
boldness
now
as
augustine
went
about
cleaning
the
iron
she
saved
up
her
spit
and
each
time
she
passed
clemence
spat
on
her
back
and
laughed
to
herself
gervaise
continued
with
the
lace
of
madame
boche
cap
in
the
sudden
calm
which
ensued
one
could
hear
coupeau
husky
voice
issuing
from
the
depths
of
the
bedroom
he
was
still
jolly
and
was
laughing
to
himself
as
he
uttered
bits
of
phrases
how
stupid
she
is
my
wife
how
stupid
of
her
to
put
me
to
bed
really
it
too
absurd
in
the
middle
of
the
day
when
one
is
sleepy
but
all
on
a
sudden
he
snored
then
gervaise
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
happy
in
knowing
that
he
was
at
length
quiet
and
sleeping
off
his
intoxication
on
two
good
mattresses
and
she
spoke
out
in
the
silence
in
a
slow
and
continuous
voice
without
taking
her
eyes
off
her
work
you
see
he
has
his
reason
one
ca
be
angry
were
i
to
be
harsh
with
him
it
would
be
of
no
use
i
prefer
to
agree
with
him
and
get
him
to
bed
then
at
least
it
over
at
once
and
i
quiet
besides
he
is
he
loves
me
very
much
you
could
see
that
just
a
moment
ago
when
he
was
desperate
to
give
me
a
kiss
that
quite
nice
of
him
there
are
plenty
of
men
you
know
who
after
drinking
a
bit
come
straight
home
but
stay
out
chasing
women
oh
he
may
fool
around
with
the
women
in
the
shop
but
it
does
lead
to
anything
clemence
you
must
feel
insulted
you
know
how
it
is
when
a
man
had
too
much
to
drink
he
could
do
anything
and
not
even
remember
it
she
spoke
composedly
not
at
all
angry
being
quite
used
to
sprees
and
not
holding
them
against
him
a
silence
settled
down
for
a
while
when
she
stopped
talking
there
was
a
lot
of
work
to
get
done
they
figured
they
would
have
to
keep
at
it
until
eleven
working
as
fast
as
they
could
now
that
they
were
undisturbed
all
of
them
were
pounding
away
bare
arms
were
moving
back
and
forth
showing
glimpses
of
pink
among
the
whiteness
of
the
laundry
more
coke
had
been
put
into
the
stove
and
the
sunlight
slanted
in
between
the
sheets
onto
the
stove
you
could
see
the
heat
rising
up
through
the
rays
of
the
sun
it
became
so
stifling
that
augustine
ran
out
of
spit
and
was
forced
to
lick
her
lips
the
room
smelled
of
the
heat
and
of
the
working
women
the
white
lilies
in
the
jar
were
beginning
to
fade
yet
they
still
exuded
a
pure
and
strong
perfume
coupeau
heavy
snores
were
heard
like
the
regular
ticking
of
a
huge
clock
setting
the
tempo
for
the
heavy
labor
in
the
shop
on
the
morrow
of
his
carouses
the
always
had
a
headache
a
splitting
headache
which
kept
him
all
day
with
his
hair
uncombed
his
breath
offensive
and
his
mouth
all
swollen
and
askew
he
got
up
late
on
those
days
not
shaking
the
fleas
off
till
about
eight
and
he
would
hang
about
the
shop
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
to
start
off
to
his
work
it
was
another
day
lost
in
the
morning
he
would
complain
that
his
legs
bent
like
pieces
of
thread
and
would
call
himself
a
great
fool
to
guzzle
to
such
an
extent
as
it
broke
one
constitution
then
too
there
were
a
lot
of
lazy
bums
who
would
let
you
go
and
you
get
to
drinking
more
in
spite
of
yourself
no
no
no
more
for
him
after
lunch
he
would
always
begin
to
perk
up
and
deny
that
he
had
been
really
drunk
the
night
before
maybe
just
a
bit
lit
up
he
was
rock
solid
and
able
to
drink
anything
he
wanted
without
even
blinking
an
eye
when
he
had
thoroughly
badgered
the
workwomen
gervaise
would
give
him
twenty
sous
to
clear
out
and
off
he
would
go
to
buy
his
tobacco
at
the
little
civet
in
the
rue
des
poissonniers
where
he
generally
took
a
plum
in
brandy
whenever
he
met
a
friend
then
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
twenty
sous
at
old
francois
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
where
there
was
a
famous
wine
quite
young
which
tickled
your
gullet
this
was
an
place
with
a
low
ceiling
there
was
a
smoky
room
to
one
side
where
soup
was
served
he
would
stay
there
until
evening
drinking
because
there
was
an
understanding
that
he
have
to
pay
right
away
and
they
would
never
send
the
bill
to
his
wife
besides
he
was
a
jolly
fellow
who
would
never
do
the
least
harm
a
chap
who
loved
a
spree
sure
enough
and
who
colored
his
nose
in
his
turn
but
in
a
nice
manner
full
of
contempt
for
those
pigs
of
men
who
have
succumbed
to
alcohol
and
whom
one
never
sees
sober
he
always
went
home
as
gay
and
as
gallant
as
a
lark
has
your
lover
been
he
would
sometimes
ask
gervaise
by
way
of
teasing
her
one
never
sees
him
now
i
must
go
and
rout
him
out
the
lover
was
goujet
he
avoided
in
fact
calling
too
often
for
fear
of
being
in
the
way
and
also
of
causing
people
to
talk
yet
he
frequently
found
a
pretext
such
as
bringing
the
washing
and
he
would
pass
no
end
of
time
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
shop
there
was
a
corner
right
at
the
back
in
which
he
liked
to
sit
without
moving
for
hours
and
smoke
his
short
pipe
once
every
ten
days
in
the
evening
after
his
dinner
he
would
venture
there
and
take
up
his
favorite
position
and
he
was
no
talker
his
mouth
almost
seemed
sewn
up
as
he
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
gervaise
and
only
removed
his
pipe
to
laugh
at
everything
she
said
when
they
were
working
late
on
a
saturday
he
would
stay
on
and
appeared
to
amuse
himself
more
than
if
he
had
gone
to
a
theatre
sometimes
the
women
stayed
in
the
shop
ironing
until
three
in
the
morning
a
lamp
hung
from
the
ceiling
and
spread
a
brilliant
light
making
the
linen
look
like
fresh
snow
the
apprentice
would
put
up
the
shop
shutters
but
since
these
july
nights
were
scorching
hot
the
door
would
be
left
open
the
later
the
hour
the
more
casual
the
women
became
with
their
clothes
while
trying
to
be
comfortable
the
lamplight
flecked
their
rosy
skin
with
gold
specks
especially
gervaise
who
was
so
pleasantly
rounded
on
these
nights
goujet
would
be
overcome
by
the
heat
from
the
stove
and
the
odor
of
linen
steaming
under
the
hot
irons
he
would
drift
into
a
sort
of
giddiness
his
thinking
slowed
and
his
eyes
obsessed
by
these
hurrying
women
as
their
naked
arms
moved
back
and
forth
working
far
into
the
night
to
have
the
neighborhood
best
clothes
ready
for
sunday
everything
around
the
laundry
was
slumbering
settled
into
sleep
for
the
night
midnight
rang
then
one
then
two
there
were
no
vehicles
or
pedestrians
in
the
dark
and
deserted
street
only
their
shop
door
let
out
any
light
once
in
a
while
footsteps
would
be
heard
and
a
man
would
pass
the
shop
as
he
crossed
the
path
of
light
he
would
stretch
his
neck
to
look
in
startled
by
the
sound
of
the
thudding
irons
and
carry
with
him
the
quick
glimpse
of
laundresses
immersed
in
a
rosy
mist
goujet
seeing
that
gervaise
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
etienne
and
wishing
to
deliver
him
from
coupeau
kicks
had
engaged
him
to
go
and
blow
the
bellows
at
the
factory
where
he
worked
the
profession
of
if
not
one
to
be
proud
of
on
account
of
the
dirt
of
the
forge
and
of
the
monotony
of
constantly
hammering
on
pieces
of
iron
of
a
similar
kind
was
nevertheless
a
well
paid
one
at
which
ten
and
even
twelve
francs
a
day
could
be
earned
the
youngster
who
was
then
twelve
years
old
would
soon
be
able
to
go
in
for
it
if
the
calling
was
to
his
liking
and
etienne
had
thus
become
another
link
between
the
laundress
and
the
blacksmith
the
latter
would
bring
the
child
home
and
speak
of
his
good
conduct
everyone
laughingly
said
that
goujet
was
smitten
with
gervaise
she
knew
it
and
blushed
like
a
young
girl
the
flush
of
modesty
coloring
her
cheeks
with
the
bright
tints
of
an
apple
the
poor
fellow
he
was
never
any
trouble
he
never
made
a
bold
gesture
or
an
indelicate
remark
you
did
find
many
men
like
him
gervaise
want
to
admit
it
but
she
derived
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
from
being
adored
like
this
whenever
a
problem
arose
she
thought
immediately
of
the
blacksmith
and
was
consoled
there
was
never
any
awkward
tension
when
they
were
alone
together
they
just
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
happily
with
no
need
to
talk
it
was
a
very
sensible
kind
of
affection
towards
the
end
of
the
summer
nana
quite
upset
the
household
she
was
six
years
old
and
promised
to
be
a
thorough
so
as
not
to
have
her
always
under
her
feet
her
mother
took
her
every
morning
to
a
little
school
in
the
rue
polonceau
kept
by
mademoiselle
josse
she
fastened
her
playfellows
dresses
together
behind
she
filled
the
with
ashes
and
invented
other
tricks
much
less
decent
which
could
not
be
mentioned
twice
mademoiselle
josse
expelled
her
and
then
took
her
back
again
so
as
not
to
lose
the
six
francs
a
month
directly
lessons
were
over
nana
avenged
herself
for
having
been
kept
in
by
making
an
infernal
noise
under
the
porch
and
in
the
courtyard
where
the
ironers
whose
ears
could
not
stand
the
racket
sent
her
to
play
there
she
would
meet
pauline
the
boches
daughter
and
victor
the
son
of
gervaise
old
employer
a
big
booby
of
ten
who
delighted
in
playing
with
very
little
girls
madame
fauconnier
who
had
not
quarreled
with
the
coupeaus
would
herself
send
her
son
in
the
house
too
there
was
an
extraordinary
swarm
of
brats
flights
of
children
who
rolled
down
the
four
staircases
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
alighted
on
the
pavement
of
the
courtyard
like
troops
of
noisy
pillaging
sparrows
madame
gaudron
was
responsible
for
nine
of
them
all
with
uncombed
hair
runny
noses
clothes
saggy
stockings
and
ripped
jackets
another
woman
on
the
sixth
floor
had
seven
of
them
this
hoard
that
only
got
their
faces
washed
when
it
rained
were
in
all
shapes
and
sizes
fat
thin
big
and
barely
out
of
the
cradle
nana
reigned
supreme
over
this
host
of
urchins
she
ordered
about
girls
twice
her
own
size
and
only
deigned
to
relinquish
a
little
of
her
power
in
favor
of
pauline
and
victor
intimate
confidants
who
enforced
her
commands
this
precious
chit
was
for
ever
wanting
to
play
at
being
mamma
undressing
the
smallest
ones
to
dress
them
again
insisting
on
examining
the
others
all
over
messing
them
about
and
exercising
the
capricious
despotism
of
a
person
with
a
vicious
disposition
under
her
leadership
they
got
up
tricks
for
which
they
should
have
been
well
spanked
the
troop
paddled
in
the
colored
water
from
the
dyer
and
emerged
from
it
with
legs
stained
blue
or
red
as
high
as
the
knees
then
off
it
flew
to
the
locksmith
where
it
purloined
nails
and
filings
and
started
off
again
to
alight
in
the
midst
of
the
carpenter
shavings
enormous
heaps
of
shavings
which
delighted
it
immensely
and
in
which
it
rolled
head
over
heels
exposing
their
behinds
the
courtyard
was
her
kingdom
it
echoed
with
the
clatter
of
little
shoes
as
they
stampeded
back
and
forth
with
piercing
cries
on
some
days
the
courtyard
was
too
small
for
them
and
the
troop
would
dash
down
into
the
cellar
race
up
a
staircase
run
along
a
corridor
then
dash
up
another
staircase
and
follow
another
corridor
for
hours
they
never
got
tired
of
their
yelling
and
clambering
are
they
abominable
those
little
toads
cried
madame
boche
really
people
can
have
but
very
little
to
do
to
have
time
to
get
so
many
brats
and
yet
they
complain
of
having
no
bread
boche
said
that
children
pushed
up
out
of
poverty
like
mushrooms
out
of
manure
all
day
long
his
wife
was
screaming
at
them
and
chasing
them
with
her
broom
finally
she
had
to
lock
the
door
of
the
cellar
when
she
learned
from
pauline
that
nana
was
playing
doctor
down
there
in
the
dark
viciously
finding
pleasure
in
applying
remedies
to
the
others
by
beating
them
with
sticks
well
one
afternoon
there
was
a
frightful
scene
it
was
bound
to
have
come
sooner
or
later
nana
had
thought
of
a
very
funny
little
game
she
had
stolen
one
of
madame
boche
wooden
shoes
from
outside
the
concierge
room
she
tied
a
string
to
it
and
began
dragging
it
about
like
a
cart
victor
on
his
side
had
had
the
idea
to
fill
it
with
potato
parings
then
a
procession
was
formed
nana
came
first
dragging
the
wooden
shoe
pauline
and
victor
walked
on
her
right
and
left
then
the
entire
crowd
of
urchins
followed
in
order
the
big
ones
first
the
little
ones
next
jostling
one
another
a
baby
in
long
skirts
about
as
tall
as
a
boot
with
an
old
tattered
bonnet
cocked
on
one
side
of
its
head
brought
up
the
rear
and
the
procession
chanted
something
sad
with
plenty
of
ohs
and
ahs
nana
had
said
that
they
were
going
to
play
at
a
funeral
the
potato
parings
represented
the
body
when
they
had
gone
the
round
of
the
courtyard
they
recommenced
they
thought
it
immensely
amusing
what
can
they
be
up
to
murmured
madame
boche
who
emerged
from
her
room
to
see
ever
mistrustful
and
on
the
alert
and
when
she
understood
but
it
my
shoe
cried
she
furiously
ah
the
rogues
she
distributed
some
smacks
clouted
nana
on
both
cheeks
and
administered
a
kick
to
pauline
that
great
goose
who
allowed
the
others
to
steal
her
mother
shoe
it
so
happened
that
gervaise
was
filling
a
bucket
at
the
tap
when
she
beheld
nana
her
nose
bleeding
and
choking
with
sobs
she
almost
sprang
at
the
concierge
chignon
it
was
not
right
to
hit
a
child
as
though
it
were
an
ox
one
could
have
no
heart
one
must
be
the
lowest
of
the
low
if
one
did
so
madame
boche
naturally
replied
in
a
similar
strain
when
one
had
a
beast
of
a
girl
like
that
one
should
keep
her
locked
up
at
length
boche
himself
appeared
in
the
doorway
to
call
his
wife
to
come
in
and
not
to
enter
into
so
many
explanations
with
a
filthy
thing
like
her
there
was
a
regular
quarrel
as
a
matter
of
fact
things
had
not
gone
on
very
pleasantly
between
the
boches
and
the
coupeaus
for
a
month
past
gervaise
who
was
of
a
very
generous
nature
was
continually
bestowing
wine
broth
oranges
and
slices
of
cake
on
the
boches
one
night
she
had
taken
the
remains
of
an
endive
and
beetroot
salad
to
the
concierge
room
knowing
that
the
latter
would
have
done
anything
for
such
a
treat
but
on
the
morrow
she
became
quite
pale
with
rage
on
hearing
mademoiselle
remanjou
relate
how
madame
boche
had
thrown
the
salad
away
in
the
presence
of
several
persons
with
an
air
of
disgust
and
under
the
pretext
that
she
thank
goodness
was
not
yet
reduced
to
feeding
on
things
which
others
had
messed
about
from
that
time
gervaise
took
no
more
presents
to
the
boches
nothing
now
the
boches
seemed
to
think
that
gervaise
was
stealing
something
which
was
rightfully
theirs
gervaise
saw
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
if
she
had
catered
to
them
so
much
in
the
beginning
they
would
have
gotten
into
the
habit
of
expecting
it
and
might
have
remained
on
good
terms
with
her
now
the
concierge
began
to
spread
slander
about
gervaise
there
was
a
great
fuss
with
the
landlord
monsieur
marescot
at
the
october
rental
period
because
gervaise
was
a
day
late
with
the
rent
madame
boche
accused
her
of
eating
up
all
her
money
in
fancy
dishes
monsieur
marescot
charged
into
the
laundry
demanding
to
be
paid
at
once
he
did
even
bother
to
remove
his
hat
the
money
was
ready
and
was
paid
to
him
immediately
the
boches
had
now
made
up
with
the
lorilleuxs
who
now
came
and
did
their
guzzling
in
the
concierge
lodge
they
assured
each
other
that
they
never
would
have
fallen
out
if
it
had
been
for
she
was
enough
to
set
mountains
to
fighting
ah
the
boches
knew
her
well
now
they
could
understand
how
much
the
lorilleuxs
must
suffer
and
whenever
she
passed
beneath
the
doorway
they
all
affected
to
sneer
at
her
one
day
gervaise
went
up
to
see
the
lorilleuxs
in
spite
of
this
it
was
with
respect
to
mother
coupeau
who
was
then
years
old
mother
coupeau
eyesight
was
almost
completely
gone
her
legs
too
were
no
longer
what
they
used
to
be
she
had
been
obliged
to
give
up
her
last
cleaning
job
and
now
threatened
to
die
of
hunger
if
assistance
were
not
forthcoming
gervaise
thought
it
shameful
that
a
woman
of
her
age
having
three
children
should
be
thus
abandoned
by
heaven
and
earth
and
as
coupeau
refused
to
speak
to
the
lorilleuxs
on
the
subject
saying
that
she
gervaise
could
very
well
go
and
do
so
the
latter
went
up
in
a
fit
of
indignation
with
which
her
heart
was
almost
bursting
when
she
reached
their
door
she
entered
without
knocking
nothing
had
been
changed
since
the
night
when
the
lorilleuxs
at
their
first
meeting
had
received
her
so
ungraciously
the
same
strip
of
faded
woolen
stuff
separated
the
room
from
the
workshop
a
lodging
like
a
gun
barrel
and
which
looked
as
though
it
had
been
built
for
an
eel
right
at
the
back
lorilleux
leaning
over
his
bench
was
squeezing
together
one
by
one
the
links
of
a
piece
of
chain
whilst
madame
lorilleux
standing
in
front
of
the
vise
was
passing
a
gold
wire
through
the
in
the
broad
daylight
the
little
forge
had
a
rosy
reflection
yes
it
i
said
gervaise
i
daresay
you
surprised
to
see
me
as
we
at
daggers
drawn
but
i
come
neither
for
you
nor
myself
you
may
be
quite
sure
it
for
mother
coupeau
that
i
come
yes
i
have
come
to
see
if
we
going
to
let
her
beg
her
bread
from
the
charity
of
others
ah
well
that
a
fine
way
to
burst
in
upon
one
murmured
madame
lorilleux
one
must
have
a
rare
cheek
and
she
turned
her
back
and
resumed
drawing
her
gold
wire
affecting
to
ignore
her
presence
but
lorilleux
raised
his
pale
face
and
cried
what
that
you
say
then
as
he
had
heard
perfectly
well
he
continued
more
eh
she
nice
mother
coupeau
to
go
and
cry
starvation
everywhere
yet
only
the
day
before
yesterday
she
dined
here
we
do
what
we
can
we
have
got
all
the
gold
of
peru
only
if
she
goes
about
gossiping
with
others
she
had
better
stay
with
them
for
we
like
spies
he
took
up
the
piece
of
chain
and
turned
his
back
also
adding
as
though
with
regret
when
everyone
gives
five
francs
a
month
we
give
five
francs
gervaise
had
calmed
down
and
felt
quite
chilled
by
the
wooden
looking
faces
of
the
lorilleux
she
had
never
once
set
foot
in
their
rooms
without
experiencing
a
certain
uneasiness
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
staring
at
the
holes
of
the
wooden
grating
through
which
the
waste
gold
fell
she
now
explained
herself
in
a
reasonable
manner
mother
coupeau
had
three
children
if
each
one
gave
five
francs
it
would
only
make
fifteen
francs
and
really
that
was
not
enough
one
could
not
live
on
it
they
must
at
least
triple
the
sum
but
lorilleux
cried
out
where
did
she
think
he
could
steal
fifteen
francs
a
month
it
was
quite
amusing
people
thought
he
was
rich
simply
because
he
had
gold
in
his
place
he
began
then
to
criticize
mother
coupeau
she
had
to
have
her
morning
coffee
she
took
a
sip
of
brandy
now
and
then
she
was
as
demanding
as
if
she
were
rich
dieu
sure
everyone
liked
the
good
things
of
life
but
if
you
never
saved
a
sou
you
had
to
do
what
other
folks
did
and
do
without
besides
mother
coupeau
was
too
old
to
work
she
could
see
well
enough
when
she
was
trying
to
pick
a
choice
morsel
from
the
platter
she
was
just
an
old
spendthrift
trying
to
get
others
to
provide
her
with
comforts
even
had
he
had
the
means
he
would
have
considered
it
wrong
to
support
any
one
in
idleness
gervaise
remained
conciliatory
and
peaceably
argued
against
all
this
bad
reasoning
she
tried
to
soften
the
lorilleuxs
but
the
husband
ended
by
no
longer
answering
her
the
wife
was
now
at
the
forge
scouring
a
piece
of
chain
in
the
little
brass
saucepan
full
of
she
still
affectedly
turned
her
back
as
though
a
hundred
leagues
away
and
gervaise
continued
speaking
watching
them
pretending
to
be
absorbed
in
their
labor
in
the
midst
of
the
black
dust
of
the
workshop
their
bodies
distorted
their
clothes
patched
and
greasy
both
become
stupidly
hardened
like
old
tools
in
the
pursuit
of
their
narrow
mechanical
task
then
suddenly
anger
again
got
the
better
of
her
and
she
exclaimed
very
well
i
rather
it
was
so
keep
your
money
i
give
mother
coupeau
a
home
do
you
hear
i
picked
up
a
cat
the
other
evening
so
i
can
at
least
do
the
same
for
your
mother
and
she
shall
be
in
want
of
nothing
she
shall
have
her
coffee
and
her
drop
of
brandy
good
heavens
what
a
vile
family
at
these
words
madame
lorilleux
turned
round
she
brandished
the
saucepan
as
though
she
was
about
to
throw
the
in
her
face
she
stammered
with
rage
be
off
or
i
shall
do
you
an
injury
and
do
count
on
the
five
francs
because
i
wo
give
a
radish
no
not
a
radish
ah
well
yes
five
francs
mother
would
be
your
servant
and
you
would
enjoy
yourself
with
my
five
francs
if
she
goes
to
live
with
you
tell
her
this
she
may
croak
i
wo
even
send
her
a
glass
of
water
now
off
you
go
clear
out
what
a
monster
of
a
woman
said
gervaise
violently
slamming
the
door
on
the
morrow
she
brought
mother
coupeau
to
live
with
her
putting
her
bed
in
the
inner
room
where
nana
slept
the
moving
did
not
take
long
for
all
the
furniture
mother
coupeau
had
was
her
bed
an
ancient
walnut
wardrobe
which
was
put
in
the
room
a
table
and
two
chairs
they
sold
the
table
and
had
the
chairs
recaned
from
the
very
first
the
old
lady
took
over
the
sweeping
she
washed
the
dishes
and
made
herself
useful
happy
to
have
settled
her
problem
the
lorilleux
were
furious
enough
to
explode
especially
since
madame
lerat
was
now
back
on
good
terms
with
the
coupeaus
one
day
the
two
sisters
the
and
the
chainmaker
came
to
blows
about
gervaise
because
madame
lerat
dared
to
express
approval
of
the
way
she
was
taking
care
of
their
mother
when
she
noticed
how
this
upset
the
other
she
went
on
to
remark
that
gervaise
had
magnificent
eyes
eyes
warm
enough
to
set
paper
on
fire
the
two
of
them
commenced
slapping
each
other
and
swore
they
never
would
see
each
other
again
nowadays
madame
lerat
often
spent
her
evenings
in
the
shop
laughing
to
herself
at
clemence
spicy
remarks
three
years
passed
by
there
were
frequent
quarrels
and
reconciliations
gervaise
did
not
care
a
straw
for
the
lorilleux
the
boches
and
all
the
others
who
were
not
of
her
way
of
thinking
if
they
did
not
like
it
they
could
forget
it
she
earned
what
she
wished
that
was
her
principal
concern
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
had
ended
by
greatly
esteeming
her
for
one
did
not
find
many
customers
so
kind
as
she
was
paying
punctually
never
caviling
or
higgling
she
bought
her
bread
of
madame
coudeloup
in
the
rue
des
poissonniers
her
meat
of
stout
charles
a
butcher
in
the
rue
polonceau
her
groceries
at
lehongre
in
the
rue
de
la
almost
opposite
her
own
shop
francois
the
wine
merchant
at
the
corner
of
the
street
supplied
her
with
wine
in
baskets
of
fifty
bottles
her
neighbor
vigouroux
whose
wife
hips
must
have
been
black
and
blue
the
men
pinched
her
so
much
sold
coke
to
her
at
the
same
price
as
the
gas
company
and
in
all
truth
her
tradespeople
served
her
faithfully
knowing
that
there
was
everything
to
gain
by
treating
her
well
besides
whenever
she
went
out
around
the
neighborhood
she
was
greeted
everywhere
she
felt
quite
at
home
sometimes
she
put
off
doing
a
laundry
job
just
to
enjoy
being
outdoors
among
her
good
friends
on
days
when
she
was
too
rushed
to
do
her
own
cooking
and
had
to
go
out
to
buy
something
already
cooked
she
would
stop
to
gossip
with
her
arms
full
of
bowls
the
neighbor
she
respected
the
most
was
still
the
watchmaker
often
she
would
cross
the
street
to
greet
him
in
his
tiny
cupboard
of
a
shop
taking
pleasure
in
the
gaiety
of
the
little
cuckoo
clocks
with
their
pendulums
ticking
away
the
hours
in
chorus
chapter
vi
one
afternoon
in
the
autumn
gervaise
who
had
been
taking
some
washing
home
to
a
customer
in
the
rue
des
found
herself
at
the
bottom
of
the
rue
des
poissonniers
just
as
the
day
was
declining
it
had
rained
in
the
morning
the
weather
was
very
mild
and
an
odor
rose
from
the
greasy
pavement
and
the
laundress
burdened
with
her
big
basket
was
rather
out
of
breath
slow
of
step
and
inclined
to
take
her
ease
as
she
ascended
the
street
with
the
vague
preoccupation
of
a
longing
increased
by
her
weariness
she
would
have
liked
to
have
had
something
to
eat
then
on
raising
her
eyes
she
beheld
the
name
of
the
rue
marcadet
and
she
suddenly
had
the
idea
of
going
to
see
goujet
at
his
forge
he
had
no
end
of
times
told
her
to
look
in
any
day
she
was
curious
to
see
how
iron
was
wrought
besides
in
the
presence
of
other
workmen
she
would
ask
for
etienne
and
make
believe
that
she
had
merely
called
for
the
youngster
the
factory
was
somewhere
on
this
end
of
the
rue
marcadet
but
she
did
know
exactly
where
and
street
numbers
were
often
lacking
on
those
ramshackle
buildings
separated
by
vacant
lots
she
would
have
lived
on
this
street
for
all
the
gold
in
the
world
it
was
a
wide
street
but
dirty
black
with
soot
from
factories
with
holes
in
the
pavement
and
deep
ruts
filled
with
stagnant
water
on
both
sides
were
rows
of
sheds
workshops
with
beams
and
brickwork
exposed
so
that
they
seemed
unfinished
a
messy
collection
of
masonry
beside
them
were
dubious
lodging
houses
and
even
more
dubious
taverns
all
she
could
recall
was
that
the
bolt
factory
was
next
to
a
yard
full
of
scrap
iron
and
rags
a
sort
of
open
sewer
spread
over
the
ground
storing
merchandise
worth
hundreds
of
thousands
of
francs
according
to
goujet
the
street
was
filled
with
a
noisy
racket
exhaust
pipes
on
roofs
puffed
out
violent
jets
of
steam
an
automatic
sawmill
added
a
rhythmic
screeching
a
button
factory
shook
the
ground
with
the
rumbling
of
its
machines
she
was
looking
up
toward
the
montmartre
height
hesitant
uncertain
whether
to
continue
when
a
gust
of
wind
blew
down
a
mass
of
sooty
smoke
that
covered
the
entire
street
she
closed
her
eyes
and
held
her
breath
at
that
moment
she
heard
the
sound
of
hammers
in
cadence
without
realizing
it
she
had
arrived
directly
in
front
of
the
bolt
factory
which
she
now
recognized
by
the
vacant
lot
beside
it
full
of
piles
of
scrap
iron
and
old
rags
she
still
hesitated
not
knowing
where
to
enter
a
broken
fence
opened
a
passage
which
seemed
to
lead
through
the
heaps
of
rubbish
from
some
buildings
recently
pulled
down
two
planks
had
been
thrown
across
a
large
puddle
of
muddy
water
that
barred
the
way
she
ended
by
venturing
along
them
turned
to
the
left
and
found
herself
lost
in
the
depths
of
a
strange
forest
of
old
carts
standing
on
end
with
their
shafts
in
the
air
and
of
hovels
in
ruins
the
of
which
was
still
standing
toward
the
back
stabbing
through
the
of
sundown
a
flame
gleamed
red
the
clamor
of
the
hammers
had
ceased
she
was
advancing
carefully
when
a
workman
his
face
blackened
with
and
wearing
a
goatee
passed
near
her
casting
a
with
his
pale
eyes
sir
asked
she
it
here
is
it
not
that
a
boy
named
etienne
works
he
my
son
etienne
etienne
repeated
the
workman
in
a
hoarse
voice
as
he
twisted
himself
about
etienne
no
i
do
know
him
an
alcoholic
reek
like
that
from
old
brandy
casks
issued
from
his
mouth
meeting
a
woman
in
this
dark
corner
seemed
to
be
giving
the
fellow
ideas
and
so
gervaise
drew
back
saying
but
yet
it
here
that
monsieur
goujet
works
is
it
ah
goujet
yes
said
the
workman
i
know
goujet
if
you
come
for
goujet
go
right
to
the
end
and
turning
round
he
called
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
which
had
a
sound
of
cracked
brass
i
say
here
a
lady
wants
you
but
a
clanging
of
iron
drowned
the
cry
gervaise
went
to
the
end
she
reached
a
door
and
stretching
out
her
neck
looked
in
at
first
she
could
distinguish
nothing
the
forge
had
died
down
but
there
was
still
a
little
glow
which
held
back
the
advancing
shadows
from
its
corner
great
shadows
seemed
to
float
in
the
air
at
times
black
shapes
passed
before
the
fire
shutting
off
this
last
bit
of
brightness
silhouettes
of
men
so
strangely
magnified
that
their
arms
and
legs
were
indistinct
gervaise
not
daring
to
venture
in
called
from
the
doorway
in
a
faint
voice
monsieur
goujet
monsieur
goujet
suddenly
all
became
lighted
up
beneath
the
puff
of
the
bellows
a
jet
of
white
flame
had
ascended
and
the
whole
interior
of
the
shed
could
be
seen
walled
in
by
wooden
planks
with
openings
roughly
plastered
over
and
brick
walls
reinforcing
the
corners
had
painted
the
whole
expanse
a
sooty
grey
spider
webs
hung
from
the
beams
like
rags
hung
up
to
dry
heavy
with
the
accumulated
dust
of
years
on
shelves
along
the
walls
or
hanging
from
nails
or
tossed
into
corners
she
saw
rusty
iron
battered
implements
and
huge
tools
the
white
flame
flared
higher
like
an
explosion
of
dazzling
sunlight
revealing
the
trampled
dirt
underfoot
where
the
polished
steel
of
four
anvils
fixed
on
blocks
took
on
a
reflection
of
silver
sprinkled
with
gold
then
gervaise
recognized
goujet
in
front
of
the
forge
by
his
beautiful
yellow
beard
etienne
was
blowing
the
bellows
two
other
workmen
were
there
but
she
only
beheld
goujet
and
walked
forward
and
stood
before
him
why
it
madame
gervaise
he
exclaimed
with
a
bright
look
on
his
face
what
a
pleasant
surprise
but
as
his
comrades
appeared
to
be
rather
amused
he
pushed
etienne
towards
his
mother
and
resumed
you
come
to
see
the
youngster
he
behaves
himself
well
beginning
to
get
some
strength
in
his
wrists
well
she
said
it
is
easy
to
find
your
way
here
i
thought
i
was
going
to
the
end
of
the
world
after
telling
about
her
journey
she
asked
why
no
one
in
the
shop
knew
etienne
name
goujet
laughed
and
explained
to
her
that
everybody
called
him
little
zouzou
because
he
had
his
hair
cut
short
like
that
of
a
zouave
while
they
were
talking
together
etienne
stopped
working
the
bellows
and
the
flame
of
the
forge
dwindled
to
a
rosy
glow
amid
the
gathering
darkness
touched
by
the
presence
of
this
smiling
young
woman
the
blacksmith
stood
gazing
at
her
then
as
neither
continued
speaking
he
seemed
to
recollect
and
broke
the
silence
excuse
me
madame
gervaise
i
something
that
has
to
be
finished
you
stay
wo
you
you
not
in
anybody
way
she
remained
etienne
returned
to
the
bellows
the
forge
was
soon
ablaze
again
with
a
cloud
of
sparks
the
more
so
as
the
youngster
wanting
to
show
his
mother
what
he
could
do
was
making
the
bellows
blow
a
regular
hurricane
goujet
standing
up
watching
a
bar
of
iron
heating
was
waiting
with
the
tongs
in
his
hand
the
bright
glare
illuminated
him
without
a
shadow
sleeves
rolled
back
shirt
neck
open
bare
arms
and
chest
when
the
bar
was
at
white
heat
he
seized
it
with
the
tongs
and
cut
it
with
a
hammer
on
the
anvil
in
pieces
of
equal
length
as
though
he
had
been
gently
breaking
pieces
of
glass
then
he
put
the
pieces
back
into
the
fire
from
which
he
took
them
one
by
one
to
work
them
into
shape
he
was
forging
hexagonal
rivets
he
placed
each
piece
in
a
of
the
anvil
bent
down
the
iron
that
was
to
form
the
head
flattened
the
six
sides
and
threw
the
finished
rivet
still
on
to
the
black
earth
where
its
bright
light
gradually
died
out
and
this
with
a
continuous
hammering
wielding
in
his
right
hand
a
hammer
weighing
five
pounds
completing
a
detail
at
every
blow
turning
and
working
the
iron
with
such
dexterity
that
he
was
able
to
talk
to
and
look
at
those
about
him
the
anvil
had
a
silvery
ring
without
a
drop
of
perspiration
quite
at
his
ease
he
struck
in
a
sort
of
a
way
not
appearing
to
exert
himself
more
than
on
the
evenings
when
he
cut
out
pictures
at
home
oh
these
are
little
rivets
of
twenty
millimetres
said
he
in
reply
to
gervaise
questions
a
fellow
can
do
his
three
hundred
a
day
but
it
requires
practice
for
one
arm
soon
grows
weary
and
when
she
asked
him
if
his
wrist
did
not
feel
stiff
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
laughed
aloud
did
she
think
him
a
young
lady
his
wrist
had
had
plenty
of
drudgery
for
fifteen
years
past
it
was
now
as
strong
as
the
iron
implements
it
had
been
so
long
in
contact
with
she
was
right
though
a
gentleman
who
had
never
forged
a
rivet
or
a
bolt
and
who
would
try
to
show
off
with
his
five
pound
hammer
would
find
himself
precious
stiff
in
the
course
of
a
couple
of
hours
it
did
not
seem
much
but
a
few
years
of
it
often
did
for
some
very
strong
fellows
during
this
conversation
the
other
workmen
were
also
hammering
away
all
together
their
tall
shadows
danced
about
in
the
light
the
red
flashes
of
the
iron
that
the
fire
traversed
the
gloomy
recesses
clouds
of
sparks
darted
out
from
beneath
the
hammers
and
shone
like
suns
on
a
level
with
the
anvils
and
gervaise
feeling
happy
and
interested
in
the
movement
round
the
forge
did
not
think
of
leaving
she
was
going
a
long
way
round
to
get
nearer
to
etienne
without
having
her
hands
burnt
when
she
saw
the
dirty
and
bearded
workman
whom
she
had
spoken
to
outside
enter
so
you
found
him
madame
asked
he
in
his
drunken
bantering
way
you
know
it
i
who
told
madame
where
to
find
you
he
was
called
otherwise
the
brick
of
bricks
a
dab
hand
at
bolt
forging
who
wetted
his
iron
every
day
with
a
pint
and
a
half
of
brandy
he
had
gone
out
to
have
a
drop
because
he
felt
he
wanted
greasing
to
make
him
last
till
six
when
he
learnt
that
little
zouzou
real
name
was
etienne
he
thought
it
very
funny
and
he
showed
his
black
teeth
as
he
laughed
then
he
recognized
gervaise
only
the
day
before
he
had
had
a
glass
of
wine
with
coupeau
you
could
speak
to
coupeau
about
otherwise
he
would
at
once
say
he
a
jolly
dog
ah
that
joker
coupeau
he
was
one
of
the
right
sort
he
stood
treat
oftener
than
his
turn
i
awfully
glad
to
know
you
his
missus
added
he
he
deserves
to
have
a
pretty
wife
eh
madame
is
a
fine
woman
is
she
he
was
becoming
quite
gallant
sidling
up
towards
the
laundress
who
took
hold
of
her
basket
and
held
it
in
front
of
her
so
as
to
keep
him
at
a
distance
goujet
annoyed
and
seeing
that
his
comrade
was
joking
because
of
his
friendship
for
gervaise
called
out
to
him
i
say
lazybones
what
about
the
forty
millimetre
bolts
do
you
think
you
equal
to
them
now
that
you
got
your
gullet
full
you
confounded
guzzler
the
blacksmith
was
alluding
to
an
order
for
big
bolts
which
necessitated
two
beaters
at
the
anvil
i
ready
to
start
at
this
moment
big
baby
replied
otherwise
it
sucks
it
thumb
and
thinks
itself
a
man
in
spite
of
your
size
i
equal
to
you
yes
that
it
at
once
look
sharp
and
off
we
go
right
you
are
my
boy
they
taunted
each
other
stimulated
by
gervaise
presence
goujet
placed
the
pieces
of
iron
that
had
been
cut
beforehand
in
the
fire
then
he
fixed
a
of
large
bore
on
an
anvil
his
comrade
had
taken
from
against
the
wall
two
weighing
twenty
pounds
each
the
two
big
sisters
of
the
factory
whom
the
workers
called
fifine
and
dedele
and
he
continued
to
brag
talking
of
a
of
rivets
which
he
had
forged
for
the
dunkirk
lighthouse
regular
jewels
things
to
be
put
in
a
museum
they
were
so
daintily
finished
off
hang
it
all
no
he
did
not
fear
competition
before
meeting
with
another
chap
like
him
you
might
search
every
factory
in
the
capital
they
were
going
to
have
a
laugh
they
would
see
what
they
would
see
madame
will
be
judge
said
he
turning
towards
the
young
woman
enough
chattering
cried
goujet
now
then
zouzou
show
your
muscle
it
not
hot
enough
my
lad
but
otherwise
asked
so
we
strike
together
not
a
bit
of
it
each
his
own
bolt
my
friend
this
statement
operated
as
a
damper
and
goujet
comrade
on
hearing
it
remained
speechless
in
spite
of
his
boasting
bolts
of
forty
millimetres
fashioned
by
one
man
had
never
before
been
seen
the
more
so
as
the
bolts
were
to
be
a
work
of
great
difficulty
a
real
masterpiece
to
achieve
the
three
other
workmen
came
over
leaving
their
jobs
to
watch
a
tall
lean
one
wagered
a
bottle
of
wine
that
goujet
would
be
beaten
meanwhile
the
two
blacksmiths
had
chosen
their
sledge
hammers
with
eyes
closed
because
fifine
weighed
a
half
pound
more
than
dedele
otherwise
had
the
good
luck
to
put
his
hand
on
dedele
fifine
fell
to
while
waiting
for
the
iron
to
get
hot
enough
otherwise
again
showing
off
struck
a
pose
before
the
anvil
while
casting
side
glances
toward
gervaise
he
planted
himself
solidly
tapping
his
feet
impatiently
like
a
man
ready
for
a
fight
throwing
all
his
strength
into
practice
swings
with
dedele
dieu
he
was
good
at
this
he
could
have
flattened
the
vendome
column
like
a
pancake
now
then
off
you
go
said
goujet
placing
one
of
the
pieces
of
iron
as
thick
as
a
girl
wrist
in
the
otherwise
leant
back
and
swung
dedele
round
with
both
hands
short
and
lean
with
his
goatee
bristling
and
with
his
eyes
glaring
beneath
his
unkempt
hair
he
seemed
to
snap
at
each
swing
of
the
hammer
springing
up
from
the
ground
as
though
carried
away
by
the
force
he
put
into
the
blow
he
was
a
fierce
one
who
fought
with
the
iron
annoyed
at
finding
it
so
hard
and
he
even
gave
a
grunt
whenever
he
thought
he
had
planted
a
fierce
stroke
perhaps
brandy
did
weaken
other
people
arms
but
he
needed
brandy
in
his
veins
instead
of
blood
the
drop
he
had
taken
a
little
while
before
had
made
his
carcass
as
warm
as
a
boiler
he
felt
he
had
the
power
of
a
within
him
and
the
iron
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
him
this
time
he
flattened
it
more
easily
than
if
it
had
been
a
quid
of
tobacco
and
it
was
a
sight
to
see
how
dedele
waltzed
she
cut
such
capers
with
her
tootsies
in
the
air
just
like
a
little
dancer
at
the
elysee
montmartre
who
exhibits
her
fine
underclothes
for
it
would
never
do
to
dawdle
iron
is
so
deceitful
it
cools
at
once
just
to
spite
the
hammer
with
thirty
blows
otherwise
had
fashioned
the
head
of
his
bolt
but
he
panted
his
eyes
were
half
out
of
his
head
and
got
into
a
great
rage
as
he
felt
his
arms
growing
tired
then
carried
away
by
wrath
jumping
about
and
yelling
he
gave
two
more
blows
just
out
of
revenge
for
his
trouble
when
he
took
the
bolt
from
the
hole
it
was
deformed
its
head
being
askew
like
a
hunchback
come
now
is
that
quickly
beaten
into
shape
said
he
all
the
same
with
his
as
he
presented
his
work
to
gervaise
i
no
judge
sir
replied
the
laundress
reservedly
but
she
saw
plainly
enough
the
marks
of
dedele
last
two
kicks
on
the
bolt
and
she
was
very
pleased
she
bit
her
lips
so
as
not
to
laugh
for
now
goujet
had
every
chance
of
winning
it
was
now
turn
before
commencing
he
gave
the
laundress
a
look
full
of
confident
tenderness
then
he
did
not
hurry
himself
he
measured
his
distance
and
swung
the
hammer
from
on
high
with
all
his
might
and
at
regular
intervals
he
had
the
classic
style
accurate
evenly
balanced
and
supple
fifine
in
his
hands
did
not
cut
capers
like
at
a
but
made
steady
certain
progress
she
rose
and
fell
in
cadence
like
a
lady
of
quality
solemnly
leading
some
ancient
minuet
there
was
no
brandy
in
veins
only
blood
throbbing
powerfully
even
into
fifine
and
controlling
the
job
that
stalwart
fellow
what
a
magnificent
man
he
was
at
work
the
high
flame
of
the
forge
shone
full
on
his
face
his
whole
face
seemed
golden
indeed
with
his
short
hair
curling
over
his
forehead
and
his
splendid
yellow
beard
his
neck
was
as
straight
as
a
column
and
his
immense
chest
was
wide
enough
for
a
woman
to
sleep
across
it
his
shoulders
and
sculptured
arms
seemed
to
have
been
copied
from
a
giant
statue
in
some
museum
you
could
see
his
muscles
swelling
mountains
of
flesh
rippling
and
hardening
under
the
skin
his
shoulders
his
chest
his
neck
expanded
he
seemed
to
shed
light
about
him
becoming
beautiful
and
like
a
kindly
god
he
had
now
swung
fifine
twenty
times
his
eyes
always
fixed
on
the
iron
drawing
a
deep
breath
with
each
blow
yet
showing
only
two
great
drops
of
sweat
trickling
down
from
his
temples
he
counted
calmly
fifine
continued
like
a
noble
lady
dancing
what
a
jeeringly
murmured
otherwise
gervaise
standing
opposite
goujet
looked
at
him
with
an
affectionate
smile
dieu
what
fools
men
are
here
these
two
men
were
pounding
on
their
bolts
to
pay
court
to
her
she
understood
it
they
were
battling
with
hammer
blows
like
two
big
red
roosters
vying
for
the
favors
of
a
little
white
hen
sometimes
the
human
heart
has
fantastic
ways
of
expressing
itself
this
thundering
of
dedele
and
fifine
upon
the
anvil
was
for
her
this
forge
roaring
and
overflowing
was
for
her
they
were
forging
their
love
before
her
battling
over
her
to
be
honest
she
rather
enjoyed
it
all
women
are
happy
to
receive
compliments
the
mighty
blows
of
found
echoes
in
her
heart
they
rang
within
her
a
music
in
time
with
the
throbbing
of
her
pulse
she
had
the
feeling
that
this
hammering
was
driving
something
deep
inside
of
her
something
solid
something
hard
as
the
iron
of
the
bolt
she
had
no
doubt
goujet
would
win
otherwise
was
much
too
ugly
in
his
dirty
tunic
jumping
around
like
a
monkey
that
had
escaped
from
a
zoo
she
waited
blushing
red
happy
that
the
heat
could
explain
the
blush
goujet
was
still
counting
and
cried
he
at
length
laying
the
hammer
on
the
ground
it
finished
you
can
look
the
head
of
the
bolt
was
clean
polished
and
without
a
flaw
regular
goldsmith
work
with
the
roundness
of
a
marble
cast
in
a
mold
the
other
men
looked
at
it
and
nodded
their
heads
there
was
no
denying
it
was
lovely
enough
to
be
worshipped
otherwise
tried
indeed
to
chuff
but
it
was
no
use
and
ended
by
returning
to
his
anvil
with
his
nose
put
out
of
joint
gervaise
had
squeezed
up
against
goujet
as
though
to
get
a
better
view
etienne
having
let
go
the
bellows
the
forge
was
once
more
becoming
enveloped
in
shadow
like
a
brilliant
red
sunset
suddenly
giving
way
to
black
night
and
the
blacksmith
and
the
laundress
experienced
a
sweet
pleasure
in
feeling
this
gloom
surround
them
in
that
shed
black
with
soot
and
filings
and
where
an
odor
of
old
iron
prevailed
they
could
not
have
thought
themselves
more
alone
in
the
bois
de
vincennes
had
they
met
there
in
the
depths
of
some
copse
he
took
her
hand
as
though
he
had
conquered
her
outside
they
scarcely
exchanged
a
word
all
he
could
find
to
say
was
that
she
might
have
taken
etienne
away
with
her
had
it
not
been
that
there
was
still
another
work
to
get
through
when
she
started
away
he
called
her
back
wanting
a
few
more
minutes
with
her
come
along
you
have
seen
all
the
place
it
quite
interesting
he
led
her
to
another
shed
where
the
owner
was
installing
a
new
machine
she
hesitated
in
the
doorway
oppressed
by
an
instinctive
dread
the
great
hall
was
vibrating
from
the
machines
and
black
shadows
filled
the
air
he
reassured
her
with
a
smile
swearing
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
only
she
should
be
careful
not
to
let
her
skirts
get
caught
in
any
of
the
gears
he
went
first
and
she
followed
into
the
deafening
hubbub
of
whistling
amid
clouds
of
steam
peopled
by
human
shadows
moving
busily
the
passages
were
very
narrow
and
there
were
obstacles
to
step
over
holes
to
avoid
passing
carts
to
move
back
from
she
distinguish
anything
clearly
or
hear
what
goujet
was
saying
gervaise
looked
up
and
stopped
to
stare
at
the
leather
belts
hanging
from
the
roof
in
a
gigantic
spider
web
each
strip
ceaselessly
revolving
the
steam
engine
that
drove
them
was
hidden
behind
a
low
brick
wall
so
that
the
belts
seemed
to
be
moving
by
themselves
she
stumbled
and
almost
fell
while
looking
up
goujet
raised
his
voice
with
explanations
there
were
the
tapping
machines
operated
by
women
which
put
threads
on
bolts
and
nuts
their
steel
gears
were
shining
with
oil
she
could
follow
the
entire
process
she
nodded
her
head
and
smiled
she
was
still
a
little
tense
however
feeling
uneasy
at
being
so
small
among
these
rough
metalworkers
she
jumped
back
more
than
once
her
blood
suddenly
chilled
by
the
dull
thud
of
a
machine
goujet
had
stopped
before
one
of
the
rivet
machines
he
stood
there
brooding
his
head
lowered
his
gaze
fixed
this
machine
forged
forty
millimetre
rivets
with
the
calm
ease
of
a
giant
nothing
could
be
simpler
the
stoker
took
the
iron
shank
from
the
furnace
the
striker
put
it
into
the
socket
where
a
continuous
stream
of
water
cooled
it
to
prevent
softening
of
the
steel
the
press
descended
and
the
bolt
flew
out
onto
the
ground
its
head
as
round
as
though
cast
in
a
mold
every
twelve
hours
this
machine
made
hundreds
of
kilograms
of
bolts
goujet
was
not
a
mean
person
but
there
were
moments
when
he
wanted
to
take
fifine
and
smash
this
machine
to
bits
because
he
was
angry
to
see
that
its
arms
were
stronger
than
his
own
he
reasoned
with
himself
telling
himself
that
human
flesh
can
not
compete
with
steel
but
he
was
still
deeply
hurt
the
day
would
come
when
machinery
would
destroy
the
skilled
worker
their
day
pay
had
already
fallen
from
twelve
francs
to
nine
francs
there
was
talk
of
cutting
it
again
he
stared
at
it
frowning
for
three
minutes
without
saying
a
word
his
yellow
beard
seemed
to
bristle
defiantly
then
gradually
an
expression
of
resignation
came
over
his
face
and
he
turned
toward
gervaise
who
was
clinging
tightly
to
him
and
said
with
a
sad
smile
well
that
machine
would
certainly
win
a
contest
but
perhaps
it
will
be
for
the
good
of
mankind
in
the
long
run
gervaise
did
care
a
bit
about
the
welfare
of
mankind
smiling
she
said
to
goujet
i
like
yours
better
because
they
show
the
hand
of
an
artist
hearing
this
gave
him
great
happiness
because
he
had
been
afraid
that
she
might
be
scornful
of
him
after
seeing
the
machines
dieu
he
might
be
stronger
than
otherwise
but
the
machines
were
stronger
yet
when
gervaise
finally
took
her
leave
goujet
was
so
happy
that
he
almost
crushed
her
with
a
hug
the
laundress
went
every
saturday
to
the
goujets
to
deliver
their
washing
they
still
lived
in
the
little
house
in
the
rue
neuve
de
la
during
the
first
year
she
had
regularly
repaid
them
twenty
francs
a
month
so
as
not
to
jumble
up
the
accounts
the
was
only
made
up
at
the
end
of
each
month
and
then
she
added
to
the
amount
whatever
sum
was
necessary
to
make
the
twenty
francs
for
the
goujets
washing
rarely
came
to
more
than
seven
or
eight
francs
during
that
time
she
had
therefore
paid
off
nearly
half
the
sum
owing
when
one
quarter
day
not
knowing
what
to
do
some
of
her
customers
not
having
kept
their
promises
she
had
been
obliged
to
go
to
the
goujets
and
borrow
from
them
sufficient
for
her
rent
on
two
other
occasions
she
had
also
applied
to
them
for
the
money
to
pay
her
workwomen
so
that
the
debt
had
increased
again
to
four
hundred
and
francs
now
she
no
longer
gave
a
halfpenny
she
worked
off
the
amount
solely
by
the
washing
it
was
not
that
she
worked
less
or
that
her
business
was
not
so
prosperous
but
something
was
going
wrong
in
her
home
the
money
seemed
to
melt
away
and
she
was
glad
when
she
was
able
to
make
both
ends
meet
dieu
what
the
use
of
complaining
as
long
as
one
gets
by
she
was
putting
on
weight
and
this
caused
her
to
become
a
bit
lazy
she
no
longer
had
the
energy
that
she
had
in
the
past
oh
well
there
was
always
something
coming
in
madame
goujet
felt
a
motherly
concern
for
gervaise
and
sometimes
reprimanded
her
this
was
due
to
the
money
owed
but
because
she
liked
her
and
did
want
to
see
her
get
into
difficulties
she
never
mentioned
the
debt
in
short
she
behaved
with
the
utmost
delicacy
the
morrow
of
gervaise
visit
to
the
forge
happened
to
be
the
last
saturday
of
the
month
when
she
reached
the
goujets
where
she
made
a
point
of
going
herself
her
basket
had
so
weighed
on
her
arms
that
she
was
quite
two
minutes
before
she
could
get
her
breath
one
would
hardly
believe
how
heavy
clothes
are
especially
when
there
are
sheets
among
them
are
you
sure
you
brought
everything
asked
madame
goujet
she
was
very
strict
on
that
point
she
insisted
on
having
her
washing
brought
home
without
a
single
article
being
kept
back
for
the
sake
of
order
as
she
said
she
also
required
the
laundress
always
to
come
on
the
day
arranged
and
at
the
same
hour
in
that
way
there
was
no
time
wasted
oh
yes
everything
is
here
replied
gervaise
smiling
you
know
i
never
leave
anything
behind
that
true
admitted
madame
goujet
you
got
into
many
bad
habits
but
you
still
free
of
that
one
and
while
the
laundress
emptied
her
basket
laying
the
linen
on
the
bed
the
old
woman
praised
her
she
never
burnt
the
things
nor
tore
them
like
so
many
others
did
neither
did
she
pull
the
buttons
off
with
the
iron
only
she
used
too
much
blue
and
made
the
too
stiff
with
starch
just
look
it
like
cardboard
continued
she
making
one
crackle
between
her
fingers
my
son
does
not
complain
but
it
cuts
his
neck
his
neck
will
be
all
scratched
when
we
return
from
vincennes
no
do
say
that
exclaimed
gervaise
quite
grieved
to
look
nice
shirts
must
be
rather
stiff
otherwise
it
as
though
one
had
a
rag
on
one
body
you
should
just
see
what
the
gentlemen
wear
i
do
all
your
things
myself
the
workwomen
never
touch
them
and
i
assure
you
i
take
great
pains
i
would
if
necessary
do
everything
over
a
dozen
times
because
it
for
you
you
know
she
slightly
blushed
as
she
stammered
out
the
last
words
she
was
afraid
of
showing
the
great
pleasure
she
took
in
ironing
goujet
shirts
she
certainly
had
no
wicked
thoughts
but
she
was
none
the
less
a
little
bit
ashamed
oh
i
not
complaining
of
your
work
i
know
it
perfection
said
madame
goujet
for
instance
you
done
this
cap
splendidly
only
you
could
bring
out
the
embroidery
like
that
and
the
flutings
are
all
so
even
oh
i
recognize
your
hand
at
once
when
you
give
even
a
to
one
of
your
workwomen
i
detect
it
at
once
in
future
use
a
little
less
starch
that
all
goujet
does
not
care
to
look
like
a
stylish
gentleman
she
had
taken
out
her
notebook
and
was
crossing
off
the
various
items
everything
was
in
order
she
noticed
that
gervaise
was
charging
six
sous
for
each
bonnet
she
protested
but
had
to
agree
that
it
was
in
line
with
present
prices
men
shirts
were
five
sous
women
underdrawers
four
sous
a
sou
and
a
half
and
aprons
one
sou
no
the
prices
were
high
some
laundresses
charged
a
sou
more
for
each
item
gervaise
was
now
calling
out
the
soiled
clothes
as
she
packed
them
in
her
basket
for
madame
goujet
to
list
then
she
lingered
on
embarrassed
by
a
request
which
she
wished
to
make
madame
goujet
she
said
at
length
if
it
does
not
inconvenience
you
i
would
like
to
take
the
money
for
the
month
washing
it
so
happened
that
that
month
was
a
very
heavy
one
the
account
they
had
made
up
together
amounting
to
ten
francs
seven
sous
madame
goujet
looked
at
her
a
moment
in
a
serious
manner
then
she
replied
my
child
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
i
will
not
refuse
you
the
money
as
you
are
in
need
of
it
only
it
scarcely
the
way
to
pay
off
your
debt
i
say
that
for
your
sake
you
know
really
now
you
should
be
careful
gervaise
received
the
lecture
with
bowed
head
and
stammering
excuses
the
ten
francs
were
to
make
up
the
amount
of
a
bill
she
had
given
her
coke
merchant
but
on
hearing
the
word
bill
madame
goujet
became
severer
still
she
gave
herself
as
an
example
she
had
reduced
her
expenditure
ever
since
goujet
wages
had
been
lowered
from
twelve
to
nine
francs
a
day
when
one
was
wanting
in
wisdom
whilst
young
one
dies
of
hunger
in
one
old
age
but
she
held
back
and
did
tell
gervaise
that
she
gave
her
their
laundry
only
in
order
to
help
her
pay
off
the
debt
before
that
she
had
done
all
her
own
washing
and
she
would
have
to
do
it
herself
again
if
the
laundry
continued
taking
so
much
cash
out
of
her
pocket
gervaise
spoke
her
thanks
and
left
quickly
as
soon
as
she
had
received
the
ten
francs
seven
sous
outside
on
the
landing
she
was
so
relieved
she
wanted
to
dance
she
was
becoming
used
to
the
annoying
unpleasant
difficulties
caused
by
a
shortage
of
money
and
preferred
to
remember
not
the
embarrassment
but
the
joy
in
escaping
from
them
it
was
also
on
that
saturday
that
gervaise
met
with
a
rather
strange
adventure
as
she
descended
the
goujets
staircase
she
was
obliged
to
stand
up
close
against
the
with
her
basket
to
make
way
for
a
tall
woman
who
was
coming
up
carrying
in
her
hand
a
very
fresh
mackerel
with
bloody
gills
in
a
piece
of
paper
she
recognized
virginie
the
girl
whose
face
she
had
slapped
at
the
they
looked
each
other
full
in
the
face
gervaise
shut
her
eyes
she
thought
for
a
moment
that
she
was
going
to
be
hit
in
the
face
with
the
fish
but
no
virginie
even
smiled
slightly
then
as
her
basket
was
blocking
the
staircase
the
laundress
wished
to
show
how
polite
she
too
could
be
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
you
are
completely
excused
replied
the
tall
brunette
and
they
remained
conversing
together
on
the
stairs
reconciled
at
once
without
having
ventured
on
a
single
allusion
to
the
past
virginie
then
years
old
had
become
a
superb
woman
of
strapping
proportions
her
face
however
looking
rather
long
between
her
two
plaits
of
jet
black
hair
she
at
once
began
to
relate
her
history
just
to
show
off
she
had
a
husband
now
she
had
married
in
the
spring
an
cabinetmaker
who
recently
left
the
army
and
who
had
applied
to
be
admitted
into
the
police
because
a
post
of
that
kind
is
more
to
be
depended
upon
and
more
respectable
she
had
been
out
to
buy
the
mackerel
for
him
he
adores
mackerel
said
she
we
must
spoil
them
those
naughty
men
must
we
but
come
up
you
shall
see
our
home
we
are
standing
in
a
draught
here
after
gervaise
had
told
of
her
own
marriage
and
that
she
had
formerly
occupied
the
very
apartment
virginie
now
had
virginie
urged
her
even
more
strongly
to
come
up
since
it
is
always
nice
to
visit
a
spot
where
one
had
been
happy
virginie
had
lived
for
five
years
on
the
left
bank
at
that
was
where
she
had
met
her
husband
while
he
was
still
in
the
army
but
she
got
tired
of
it
and
wanted
to
come
back
to
the
neighborhood
where
she
knew
everyone
she
had
only
been
living
in
the
rooms
opposite
the
goujets
for
two
weeks
oh
everything
was
still
a
mess
but
they
were
slowly
getting
it
in
order
then
still
on
the
staircase
they
finally
told
each
other
their
names
madame
coupeau
madame
poisson
and
from
that
time
forth
they
called
each
other
on
every
possible
occasion
madame
poisson
and
madame
coupeau
solely
for
the
pleasure
of
being
madame
they
who
in
former
days
had
been
acquainted
when
occupying
rather
questionable
positions
however
gervaise
felt
rather
mistrustful
at
heart
perhaps
the
tall
brunette
had
made
it
up
the
better
to
avenge
herself
for
the
beating
at
the
by
concocting
some
plan
worthy
of
a
spiteful
hypocritical
creature
gervaise
determined
to
be
upon
her
guard
for
the
time
being
as
virginie
behaved
so
nicely
she
would
be
nice
also
in
the
room
upstairs
poisson
the
husband
a
man
of
with
a
countenance
and
carroty
moustaches
and
beard
was
seated
working
at
a
table
near
the
window
he
was
making
little
boxes
his
only
tools
were
a
knife
a
tiny
saw
the
size
of
a
nail
file
and
a
pot
of
glue
he
was
using
wood
from
old
cigar
boxes
thin
boards
of
unfinished
mahogany
upon
which
he
executed
fretwork
and
embellishments
of
extraordinary
delicacy
all
year
long
he
worked
at
making
the
same
size
boxes
only
varying
them
occasionally
by
inlay
work
new
designs
for
the
cover
or
putting
compartments
inside
he
did
not
sell
his
work
he
distributed
it
in
presents
to
persons
of
his
acquaintance
it
was
for
his
own
amusement
a
way
of
occupying
his
time
while
waiting
for
his
appointment
to
the
police
force
it
was
all
that
remained
with
him
from
his
former
occupation
of
cabinetmaking
poisson
rose
from
his
seat
and
politely
bowed
to
gervaise
when
his
wife
introduced
her
as
an
old
friend
but
he
was
no
talker
he
at
once
returned
to
his
little
saw
from
time
to
time
he
merely
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
mackerel
placed
on
the
corner
of
the
chest
of
drawers
gervaise
was
very
pleased
to
see
her
old
lodging
once
more
she
told
them
whereabouts
her
own
furniture
stood
and
pointed
out
the
place
on
the
floor
where
nana
had
been
born
how
strange
it
was
to
meet
like
this
again
after
so
many
years
they
never
dreamed
of
running
into
each
other
like
this
and
even
living
in
the
same
rooms
virginie
added
some
further
details
her
husband
had
inherited
a
little
money
from
an
aunt
and
he
would
probably
set
her
up
in
a
shop
before
long
meanwhile
she
was
still
sewing
at
length
at
the
end
of
a
full
half
hour
the
laundress
took
her
leave
poisson
scarcely
seemed
to
notice
her
departure
while
seeing
her
to
the
door
virginie
promised
to
return
the
visit
and
she
would
have
gervaise
do
her
laundry
while
virginie
was
keeping
her
in
further
conversation
on
the
landing
gervaise
had
the
feeling
that
she
wanted
to
say
something
about
lantier
and
her
sister
adele
and
this
notion
upset
her
a
bit
but
not
a
word
was
uttered
respecting
those
unpleasant
things
they
parted
wishing
each
other
in
a
very
amiable
manner
madame
coupeau
madame
poisson
that
was
the
starting
point
of
a
great
friendship
a
week
later
virginie
never
passed
gervaise
shop
without
going
in
and
she
remained
there
gossiping
for
hours
together
to
such
an
extent
indeed
that
poisson
filled
with
anxiety
fearing
she
had
been
run
over
would
come
and
seek
her
with
his
expressionless
and
countenance
now
that
she
was
seeing
the
dressmaker
every
day
gervaise
became
aware
of
a
strange
obsession
every
time
virginie
began
to
talk
gervaise
had
the
feeling
lantier
was
going
to
be
mentioned
so
she
had
lantier
on
her
mind
throughout
all
of
virginie
visits
this
was
silly
because
in
fact
she
did
care
a
bit
about
lantier
or
adele
at
this
time
she
was
quite
certain
that
she
had
no
curiosity
as
to
what
had
happened
to
either
of
them
but
this
obsession
got
hold
of
her
in
spite
of
herself
anyway
she
did
hold
it
against
virginie
it
was
her
fault
surely
she
enjoyed
being
with
her
and
looked
forward
to
her
visits
meanwhile
winter
had
come
the
coupeaus
fourth
winter
in
the
rue
de
la
december
and
january
were
particularly
cold
it
froze
hard
as
it
well
could
after
new
year
day
the
snow
remained
three
weeks
without
melting
it
did
not
interfere
with
work
but
the
contrary
for
winter
is
the
best
season
for
the
ironers
it
was
very
pleasant
inside
the
shop
there
was
never
any
ice
on
the
like
there
was
at
the
grocer
and
the
hosier
opposite
the
stove
was
always
stuffed
with
coke
and
kept
things
as
hot
as
a
turkish
bath
with
the
laundry
steaming
overhead
you
could
almost
imagine
it
was
summer
you
were
quite
comfortable
with
the
doors
closed
and
so
much
warmth
everywhere
that
you
were
tempted
to
doze
off
with
your
eyes
open
gervaise
laughed
and
said
it
reminded
her
of
summer
in
the
country
the
street
traffic
made
no
noise
in
the
snow
and
you
could
hardly
hear
the
pedestrians
who
passed
by
only
children
voices
were
heard
in
the
silence
especially
the
noisy
band
of
urchins
who
had
made
a
long
slide
in
the
gutter
near
the
blacksmith
shop
gervaise
would
sometimes
go
over
to
the
door
wipe
the
moisture
from
one
of
the
panes
with
her
hand
and
look
out
to
see
what
was
happening
to
her
neighborhood
due
to
this
extraordinary
cold
spell
not
one
nose
was
being
poked
out
of
the
adjacent
shops
the
entire
neighborhood
was
muffled
in
snow
the
only
person
she
was
able
to
exchange
nods
with
was
the
next
door
who
still
walked
out
despite
the
severe
freeze
what
was
especially
enjoyable
in
this
awful
weather
was
to
have
some
nice
hot
coffee
in
the
middle
of
the
day
the
workwomen
had
no
cause
for
complaint
the
mistress
made
it
very
strong
and
without
a
grain
of
chicory
it
was
quite
different
to
madame
fauconnier
coffee
which
was
like
only
whenever
mother
coupeau
undertook
to
make
it
it
was
always
an
interminable
time
before
it
was
ready
because
she
would
fall
asleep
over
the
kettle
on
these
occasions
when
the
workwomen
had
finished
their
lunch
they
would
do
a
little
ironing
whilst
waiting
for
the
coffee
it
so
happened
that
on
the
morrow
of
twelve
struck
and
still
the
coffee
was
not
ready
it
seemed
to
persist
in
declining
to
pass
through
the
strainer
mother
coupeau
tapped
against
the
pot
with
a
and
one
could
hear
the
drops
falling
slowly
one
by
one
and
without
hurrying
themselves
any
the
more
leave
it
alone
said
tall
clemence
you
make
it
thick
there
be
as
much
to
eat
as
to
drink
tall
clemence
was
working
on
a
man
shirt
the
plaits
of
which
she
separated
with
her
she
had
caught
a
cold
her
eyes
were
frightfully
swollen
and
her
chest
was
shaken
with
fits
of
coughing
which
doubled
her
up
beside
the
with
all
that
she
had
not
even
a
handkerchief
round
her
neck
and
she
was
dressed
in
some
cheap
flimsy
woolen
stuff
in
which
she
shivered
close
by
madame
putois
wrapped
up
in
flannel
muffled
up
to
her
ears
was
ironing
a
petticoat
which
she
turned
round
the
the
narrow
end
of
which
rested
on
the
back
of
a
chair
whilst
a
sheet
laid
on
the
floor
prevented
the
petticoat
from
getting
dirty
as
it
trailed
along
the
tiles
gervaise
alone
occupied
half
the
with
some
embroidered
muslin
curtains
over
which
she
passed
her
iron
in
a
straight
line
with
her
arms
stretched
out
to
avoid
making
any
creases
all
on
a
sudden
the
coffee
running
through
noisily
caused
her
to
raise
her
head
it
was
that
augustine
who
had
just
given
it
an
outlet
by
thrusting
a
spoon
through
the
strainer
leave
it
alone
cried
gervaise
whatever
is
the
matter
with
you
it
be
like
drinking
mud
now
mother
coupeau
had
placed
five
glasses
on
a
corner
of
the
that
was
free
the
women
now
left
their
work
the
mistress
always
poured
out
the
coffee
herself
after
putting
two
lumps
of
sugar
into
each
glass
it
was
the
moment
that
they
all
looked
forward
to
on
this
occasion
as
each
one
took
her
glass
and
squatted
down
on
a
little
stool
in
front
of
the
stove
the
opened
virginie
entered
shivering
all
over
ah
my
children
said
she
it
cuts
you
in
two
i
can
no
longer
feel
my
ears
the
cold
is
something
awful
why
it
madame
poisson
exclaimed
gervaise
ah
well
you
come
at
the
right
time
you
must
have
some
coffee
with
us
on
my
word
i
ca
say
no
one
feels
the
frost
in
one
bones
merely
by
crossing
the
street
there
was
still
some
coffee
left
luckily
mother
coupeau
went
and
fetched
a
sixth
glass
and
gervaise
let
virginie
help
herself
to
sugar
out
of
politeness
the
workwomen
moved
to
give
virginie
a
small
space
close
to
the
stove
her
nose
was
very
red
she
shivered
a
bit
pressing
her
hands
which
were
stiff
with
cold
around
the
glass
to
warm
them
she
had
just
come
from
the
grocery
store
where
you
froze
to
death
waiting
for
a
of
cheese
and
so
she
raved
about
the
warmth
of
the
shop
it
felt
so
good
on
one
skin
after
warming
up
she
stretched
out
her
long
legs
and
the
six
of
them
relaxed
together
supping
their
coffee
slowly
surround
by
all
the
work
still
to
be
done
mother
coupeau
and
virginie
were
the
only
ones
on
chairs
the
others
on
low
benches
seemed
to
be
sitting
on
the
floor
augustine
had
pulled
over
a
corner
of
the
cloth
below
the
skirt
stretching
herself
out
on
it
no
one
spoke
at
first
all
kept
their
noses
in
their
glasses
enjoying
their
coffee
it
not
bad
all
the
same
declared
clemence
but
she
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
coughing
and
almost
choked
she
leant
her
head
against
the
wall
to
cough
with
more
force
that
a
bad
cough
you
got
said
virginie
wherever
did
you
catch
it
one
never
knows
replied
clemence
wiping
her
face
with
her
sleeve
it
must
have
been
the
other
night
there
were
two
girls
who
were
flaying
each
other
outside
the
i
wanted
to
see
so
i
stood
there
whilst
the
snow
was
falling
ah
what
a
drubbing
it
was
enough
to
make
one
die
with
laughing
one
had
her
nose
almost
pulled
off
the
blood
streamed
on
the
ground
when
the
other
a
great
long
stick
like
me
saw
the
blood
she
slipped
away
as
quick
as
she
could
and
i
coughed
nearly
all
night
besides
that
too
men
are
so
stupid
in
bed
they
do
let
you
have
any
covers
over
you
half
the
time
pretty
conduct
that
murmured
madame
putois
you
killing
yourself
my
girl
and
if
it
pleases
me
to
kill
myself
life
is
so
very
amusing
slaving
all
the
blessed
day
long
to
earn
sous
cooking
blood
from
morning
to
night
in
front
of
the
stove
no
you
know
had
enough
of
it
all
the
same
though
this
cough
wo
do
me
the
service
of
making
me
croak
it
go
off
the
same
way
it
came
a
short
silence
ensued
the
clemence
who
led
riots
in
low
dancing
establishments
and
shrieked
like
a
at
work
always
saddened
everyone
with
her
thoughts
of
death
gervaise
knew
her
well
and
so
merely
said
you
never
very
gay
the
morning
after
a
night
of
high
living
the
truth
was
that
gervaise
did
not
like
this
talk
about
women
fighting
because
of
the
flogging
at
the
it
annoyed
her
whenever
anyone
spoke
before
her
and
virginie
of
kicks
with
wooden
shoes
and
of
slaps
in
the
face
it
so
happened
too
that
virginie
was
looking
at
her
and
smiling
by
the
way
she
said
quietly
yesterday
i
saw
some
they
almost
tore
each
other
to
pieces
who
were
they
madame
putois
inquired
the
midwife
and
her
maid
you
know
a
little
blonde
what
a
pest
the
girl
is
she
was
yelling
at
her
employer
that
she
had
got
rid
of
a
child
for
the
fruit
woman
and
that
she
was
going
to
tell
the
police
if
she
was
paid
to
keep
quiet
so
the
midwife
slapped
her
right
in
the
face
and
then
the
little
blonde
jumped
on
her
and
started
scratching
her
and
pulling
her
hair
really
by
the
roots
the
had
to
grab
her
to
put
a
stop
to
it
the
workwomen
laughed
then
they
all
took
a
sip
of
coffee
do
you
believe
that
she
really
got
rid
of
a
child
clemence
asked
oh
yes
the
rumor
was
all
round
the
neighborhood
virginie
answered
i
did
see
it
myself
you
understand
but
it
part
of
the
job
all
midwives
do
it
well
exclaimed
madame
putois
you
have
to
be
pretty
stupid
to
put
yourself
in
their
hands
no
thanks
you
could
be
maimed
for
life
but
there
a
sure
way
to
do
it
drink
a
glass
of
holy
water
every
evening
and
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
three
times
over
your
stomach
with
your
thumb
then
your
troubles
will
be
over
everyone
thought
mother
coupeau
was
asleep
but
she
shook
her
head
in
protest
she
knew
another
way
and
it
was
infallible
you
had
to
eat
a
egg
every
two
hours
and
put
spinach
leaves
on
your
loins
augustine
set
up
a
when
she
heard
this
they
had
forgotten
about
her
gervaise
lifted
up
the
petticoat
that
was
being
ironed
and
found
her
rolling
on
the
floor
with
laughter
she
jerked
her
upright
what
was
she
laughing
about
was
it
right
for
her
to
be
eavesdropping
when
older
people
were
talking
the
little
goose
anyway
it
was
time
for
her
to
deliver
the
laundry
to
a
friend
of
madame
lerat
at
les
batignolles
so
gervaise
hung
a
basket
on
her
arm
and
pushed
her
toward
the
door
augustine
went
off
sobbing
and
sniveling
dragging
her
feet
in
the
snow
meanwhile
mother
coupeau
madame
putois
and
clemence
were
discussing
the
effectiveness
of
eggs
and
spinach
leaves
then
virginie
said
softly
dieu
you
have
a
fight
and
then
you
make
it
up
if
you
have
a
generous
heart
she
leaned
toward
gervaise
with
a
smile
and
added
really
i
do
hold
any
grudge
against
you
for
that
business
at
the
you
remember
it
do
you
this
was
what
gervaise
had
been
dreading
she
guessed
that
the
subject
of
lantier
and
adele
would
now
come
up
virginie
had
moved
close
to
gervaise
so
as
not
to
be
overheard
by
the
others
gervaise
lulled
by
the
excessive
heat
felt
so
limp
that
she
could
even
summon
the
willpower
to
change
the
subject
she
foresaw
what
the
tall
brunette
would
say
and
her
heart
was
stirred
with
an
emotion
which
she
did
want
to
admit
to
herself
i
hope
i
not
hurting
your
feelings
virginie
continued
often
had
it
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
but
since
we
are
now
on
the
subject
word
of
honor
i
do
have
any
grudge
against
you
she
stirred
her
remaining
coffee
and
then
took
a
small
sip
gervaise
with
her
heart
in
her
throat
wondered
if
virginie
had
really
forgiven
her
as
completely
as
she
said
for
she
seemed
to
observe
sparks
in
her
dark
eyes
you
see
virginie
went
on
you
had
an
excuse
they
played
a
really
rotten
dirty
trick
on
you
to
be
fair
about
it
if
it
had
been
me
have
taken
a
knife
to
her
she
drank
another
small
sip
then
added
rapidly
without
a
pause
anyway
it
did
bring
them
happiness
not
a
bit
of
it
they
went
to
live
over
at
la
glaciere
in
a
filthy
street
that
was
always
muddy
i
went
two
days
later
to
have
lunch
with
them
i
can
tell
you
it
was
quite
a
trip
by
bus
well
i
found
them
already
fighting
really
as
i
came
in
they
were
boxing
each
other
ears
fine
pair
of
love
birds
adele
is
worth
the
rope
to
hang
her
i
say
that
even
if
she
is
my
own
sister
it
would
take
too
long
to
relate
all
the
nasty
tricks
she
played
on
me
and
anyhow
it
between
the
two
of
us
as
for
lantier
well
he
no
good
either
he
beat
the
hide
off
you
for
anything
and
with
his
fist
closed
too
they
fought
all
the
time
the
police
even
came
once
virginie
went
on
about
other
fights
oh
she
knew
of
things
that
would
make
your
hair
stand
up
gervaise
listened
in
silence
her
face
pale
it
was
nearly
seven
years
since
she
had
heard
a
word
about
lantier
she
had
realized
what
a
strong
curiosity
she
had
as
to
what
had
become
of
the
poor
man
even
though
he
had
treated
her
badly
and
she
never
would
have
believed
that
just
the
mention
of
his
name
could
put
such
a
glowing
warmth
in
the
pit
of
her
stomach
she
certainly
had
no
reason
to
be
jealous
of
adele
any
more
but
she
rejoiced
to
think
of
her
body
all
bruised
from
the
beatings
she
could
have
listened
to
virginie
all
night
but
she
did
ask
any
questions
not
wanting
to
appear
much
interested
virginie
stopped
to
sip
at
her
coffee
gervaise
realizing
that
she
was
expected
to
say
something
asked
with
a
pretence
of
indifference
are
they
still
living
at
la
glaciere
no
the
other
replied
did
i
tell
you
they
separated
last
week
one
morning
adele
moved
out
and
lantier
did
chase
after
her
so
they
separated
gervaise
exclaimed
who
are
you
talking
about
clemence
asked
interrupting
her
conversation
with
mother
coupeau
and
madame
putois
nobody
you
know
said
virginie
she
was
looking
at
gervaise
carefully
and
could
see
that
she
was
upset
she
moved
still
closer
maliciously
finding
pleasure
in
bringing
up
these
old
stories
of
a
sudden
she
asked
gervaise
what
she
would
do
if
lantier
came
round
here
men
were
really
such
strange
creatures
he
might
decide
to
return
to
his
first
love
this
caused
gervaise
to
sit
up
very
straight
and
dignified
she
was
a
married
woman
she
would
send
lantier
off
immediately
there
was
no
possibility
of
anything
further
between
them
not
even
a
handshake
she
would
not
even
want
to
look
that
man
in
the
face
i
know
that
etienne
is
his
son
and
that
a
relationship
that
remains
she
said
if
lantier
wants
to
see
his
son
i
send
the
boy
to
him
because
you
ca
stop
a
father
from
seeing
his
child
but
as
for
myself
i
do
want
him
to
touch
me
even
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
that
is
all
finished
desiring
to
break
off
this
conversation
she
seemed
to
awake
with
a
start
and
called
out
to
the
women
you
ladies
do
you
think
all
these
clothes
are
going
to
iron
themselves
get
to
work
the
workwomen
slow
from
the
heat
and
general
laziness
did
hurry
themselves
but
went
right
on
talking
gossiping
about
other
people
they
had
known
gervaise
shook
herself
and
got
to
her
feet
could
earn
money
by
sitting
all
day
she
was
the
first
to
return
to
the
ironing
but
found
that
her
curtains
had
been
spotted
by
the
coffee
and
she
had
to
rub
out
the
stains
with
a
damp
cloth
the
other
women
were
now
stretching
and
getting
ready
to
begin
ironing
clemence
had
a
terrible
attack
of
coughing
as
soon
as
she
moved
finally
she
was
able
to
return
to
the
shirt
she
had
been
doing
madame
putois
began
to
work
on
the
petticoat
again
well
said
virginie
i
only
came
out
for
a
of
swiss
cheese
poisson
must
think
i
frozen
to
death
on
the
way
she
had
only
just
stepped
outside
when
she
turned
back
to
say
that
augustine
was
at
the
end
of
the
street
sliding
on
the
ice
with
some
urchins
the
imp
rushed
in
all
and
out
of
breath
with
snow
all
in
her
hair
she
did
mind
the
scolding
she
received
merely
saying
that
she
had
been
able
to
walk
fast
because
of
the
ice
and
then
some
brats
threw
snow
at
her
the
afternoons
were
all
the
same
these
winter
days
the
laundry
was
the
refuge
for
anyone
in
the
neighborhood
who
was
cold
there
was
an
endless
procession
of
gossiping
women
gervaise
took
pride
in
the
comforting
warmth
of
her
shop
and
welcomed
those
who
came
in
holding
a
salon
as
the
lorilleuxs
and
the
boches
remarked
meanly
gervaise
was
always
thoughtful
and
generous
sometimes
she
even
invited
poor
people
in
if
she
saw
them
shivering
outside
a
friendship
sprang
up
with
an
elderly
who
was
seventy
he
lived
in
an
attic
room
and
was
slowly
dying
of
cold
and
hunger
his
three
sons
had
been
killed
in
the
war
he
survived
the
best
he
could
but
it
had
been
two
years
since
he
had
been
able
to
hold
a
in
his
hand
whenever
gervaise
saw
pere
bru
walking
outside
she
would
call
him
in
and
arrange
a
place
for
him
close
to
the
stove
often
she
gave
him
some
bread
and
cheese
pere
bru
face
was
as
wrinkled
as
a
withered
apple
he
would
sit
there
with
his
stooping
shoulders
and
his
white
beard
without
saying
a
word
just
listening
to
the
coke
sputtering
in
the
stove
maybe
he
was
thinking
of
his
fifty
years
of
hard
work
on
high
ladders
his
fifty
years
spent
painting
doors
and
whitewashing
ceilings
in
every
corner
of
paris
well
pere
bru
gervaise
would
say
what
are
you
thinking
of
now
nothing
much
all
sorts
of
things
he
would
answer
quietly
the
workwomen
tried
to
joke
with
him
to
cheer
him
up
saying
he
was
worrying
over
his
love
affairs
but
he
scarcely
listened
to
them
before
he
fell
back
into
his
habitual
attitude
of
meditative
melancholy
virginie
now
frequently
spoke
to
gervaise
of
lantier
she
seemed
to
find
amusement
in
filling
her
mind
with
ideas
of
her
old
lover
just
for
the
pleasure
of
embarrassing
her
by
making
suggestions
one
day
she
related
that
she
had
met
him
then
as
the
laundress
took
no
notice
she
said
nothing
further
and
it
was
only
on
the
morrow
that
she
added
he
had
spoken
about
her
for
a
long
time
and
with
a
great
show
of
affection
gervaise
was
much
upset
by
these
reports
whispered
in
her
ear
in
a
corner
of
the
shop
the
mention
of
lantier
name
always
caused
a
worried
sensation
in
the
pit
of
her
stomach
she
certainly
thought
herself
strong
she
wished
to
lead
the
life
of
an
industrious
woman
because
labor
is
the
half
of
happiness
so
she
never
considered
coupeau
in
this
matter
having
nothing
to
reproach
herself
with
as
regarded
her
husband
not
even
in
her
thoughts
but
with
a
hesitating
and
suffering
heart
she
would
think
of
the
blacksmith
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
memory
of
lantier
that
slow
possession
which
she
was
resuming
rendered
her
unfaithful
to
goujet
to
their
unavowed
love
sweet
as
friendship
she
passed
sad
days
whenever
she
felt
herself
guilty
towards
her
good
friend
she
would
have
liked
to
have
had
no
affection
for
anyone
but
him
outside
of
her
family
it
was
a
feeling
far
above
all
carnal
thoughts
for
the
signs
of
which
upon
her
burning
face
virginie
was
ever
on
the
watch
as
soon
as
spring
came
gervaise
often
went
and
sought
refuge
with
goujet
she
could
no
longer
sit
musing
on
a
chair
without
immediately
thinking
of
her
first
lover
she
pictured
him
leaving
adele
packing
his
clothes
in
the
bottom
of
their
old
trunk
and
returning
to
her
in
a
cab
the
days
when
she
went
out
she
was
seized
with
the
most
foolish
fears
in
the
street
she
was
ever
thinking
she
heard
lantier
footsteps
behind
her
she
did
not
dare
turn
round
but
tremblingly
fancied
she
felt
his
hands
seizing
her
round
the
waist
he
was
no
doubt
spying
upon
her
he
would
appear
before
her
some
afternoon
and
the
bare
idea
threw
her
into
a
cold
perspiration
because
he
would
to
a
certainty
kiss
her
on
the
ear
as
he
used
to
do
in
former
days
solely
to
tease
her
it
was
this
kiss
which
frightened
her
it
rendered
her
deaf
beforehand
it
filled
her
with
a
buzzing
amidst
which
she
could
only
distinguish
the
sound
of
her
heart
beating
violently
so
as
soon
as
these
fears
seized
upon
her
the
forge
was
her
only
shelter
there
under
protection
she
once
more
became
easy
and
smiling
as
his
sonorous
hammer
drove
away
her
disagreeable
reflections
what
a
happy
time
the
laundress
took
particular
pains
with
the
washing
of
her
customer
in
the
rue
des
she
always
took
it
home
herself
because
that
errand
every
friday
was
a
ready
excuse
for
passing
through
the
rue
marcadet
and
looking
in
at
the
forge
the
moment
she
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
she
felt
light
and
gay
as
though
in
the
midst
of
those
plots
of
waste
land
surrounded
by
grey
factories
she
were
out
in
the
country
the
roadway
black
with
the
plumage
of
steam
over
the
roofs
amused
her
as
much
as
a
path
leading
through
masses
of
green
foliage
in
a
wood
in
the
environs
and
she
loved
the
dull
horizon
streaked
by
the
tall
the
montmartre
heights
which
hid
the
heavens
from
view
the
chalky
white
houses
pierced
with
the
uniform
openings
of
their
windows
she
would
slacken
her
steps
as
she
drew
near
jumping
over
the
pools
of
water
and
finding
a
pleasure
in
traversing
the
deserted
ins
and
outs
of
the
yard
full
of
old
building
materials
right
at
the
further
end
the
forge
shone
with
a
brilliant
light
even
at
her
heart
leapt
with
the
dance
of
the
hammers
when
she
entered
her
face
turned
quite
red
the
little
fair
hairs
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
flew
about
like
those
of
a
woman
arriving
at
some
lovers
meeting
goujet
was
expecting
her
his
arms
and
chest
bare
whilst
he
hammered
harder
on
the
anvil
on
those
days
so
as
to
make
himself
heard
at
a
distance
he
divined
her
presence
and
greeted
her
with
a
good
silent
laugh
in
his
yellow
beard
but
she
would
not
let
him
leave
off
his
work
she
begged
him
to
take
up
his
hammer
again
because
she
loved
him
the
more
when
he
wielded
it
with
his
big
arms
swollen
with
muscles
she
would
go
and
give
etienne
a
gentle
tap
on
the
cheek
as
he
hung
on
to
the
bellows
and
then
remain
for
an
hour
watching
the
rivets
the
two
did
not
exchange
a
dozen
words
they
could
not
have
more
completely
satisfied
their
love
if
alone
in
a
room
with
the
door
the
snickering
of
otherwise
did
not
bother
them
in
the
least
for
they
no
longer
even
heard
him
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
would
begin
to
feel
slightly
oppressed
the
heat
the
powerful
smell
the
ascending
smoke
made
her
dizzy
whilst
the
dull
thuds
of
the
hammers
shook
her
from
the
crown
of
her
head
to
the
soles
of
her
feet
then
she
desired
nothing
more
it
was
her
pleasure
had
goujet
pressed
her
in
his
arms
it
would
not
have
procured
her
so
sweet
an
emotion
she
drew
close
to
him
that
she
might
feel
the
wind
raised
by
his
hammer
beat
upon
her
cheek
and
become
as
it
were
a
part
of
the
blow
he
struck
when
the
sparks
made
her
soft
hands
smart
she
did
not
withdraw
them
on
the
contrary
she
enjoyed
the
rain
of
fire
which
stung
her
skin
he
for
certain
divined
the
happiness
which
she
tasted
there
he
always
kept
the
most
difficult
work
for
the
fridays
so
as
to
pay
his
court
to
her
with
all
his
strength
and
all
his
skill
he
no
longer
spared
himself
at
the
risk
of
splitting
the
anvils
in
two
as
he
panted
and
his
loins
vibrated
with
the
joy
he
was
procuring
her
all
one
their
love
thus
filled
goujet
with
the
rumbling
of
a
storm
it
was
an
idyll
amongst
labor
in
the
midst
of
the
glare
of
the
coal
fire
and
of
the
shaking
of
the
shed
the
cracking
carcass
of
which
was
black
with
soot
all
that
beaten
iron
kneaded
like
red
wax
preserved
the
rough
marks
of
their
love
when
on
the
fridays
the
laundress
parted
from
she
slowly
reascended
the
rue
des
poissonniers
contented
and
tired
her
mind
and
her
body
alike
tranquil
little
by
little
her
fear
of
lantier
diminished
her
good
sense
got
the
better
of
her
at
that
time
she
would
still
have
led
a
happy
life
had
it
not
been
for
coupeau
who
was
decidedly
going
to
the
bad
one
day
she
just
happened
to
be
returning
from
the
forge
when
she
fancied
she
recognized
coupeau
inside
pere
colombe
in
the
act
of
treating
himself
to
a
round
of
vitriol
in
the
company
of
and
otherwise
she
passed
quickly
by
so
as
not
to
seem
to
be
spying
on
them
but
she
glanced
back
it
was
indeed
coupeau
who
was
tossing
his
little
glass
of
bad
brandy
down
his
throat
with
a
gesture
already
familiar
he
lied
then
so
he
went
in
for
brandy
now
she
returned
home
in
despair
all
her
old
dread
of
brandy
took
possession
of
her
she
forgave
the
wine
because
wine
nourishes
the
workman
all
kinds
of
spirit
on
the
contrary
were
filth
poisons
which
destroyed
in
the
workman
the
taste
for
bread
ah
the
government
ought
to
prevent
the
manufacture
of
such
horrid
stuff
on
arriving
at
the
rue
de
la
she
found
the
whole
house
upset
her
workwomen
had
left
the
shop
and
were
in
the
courtyard
looking
up
above
she
questioned
clemence
it
old
bijard
who
giving
his
wife
a
hiding
replied
the
ironer
he
was
in
the
doorway
as
drunk
as
a
trooper
watching
for
her
return
from
the
he
whacked
her
up
the
stairs
and
now
finishing
her
off
up
there
in
their
room
listen
ca
you
hear
her
shrieks
gervaise
hastened
to
the
spot
she
felt
some
friendship
for
her
madame
bijard
who
was
a
very
courageous
woman
she
had
hoped
to
put
a
stop
to
what
was
going
on
upstairs
on
the
sixth
floor
the
door
of
the
room
was
wide
open
some
lodgers
were
shouting
on
the
landing
whilst
madame
boche
standing
in
front
of
the
door
was
calling
out
will
you
leave
off
i
shall
send
for
the
police
do
you
hear
no
one
dared
to
venture
inside
the
room
because
it
was
known
that
bijard
was
like
a
brute
beast
when
he
was
drunk
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
scarcely
ever
sober
the
rare
days
on
which
he
worked
he
placed
a
bottle
of
brandy
beside
his
blacksmith
vise
gulping
some
of
it
down
every
half
hour
he
could
not
keep
himself
going
any
other
way
he
would
have
blazed
away
like
a
torch
if
anyone
had
placed
a
lighted
match
close
to
his
mouth
but
we
must
let
her
be
murdered
said
gervaise
all
in
a
tremble
and
she
entered
the
room
an
attic
and
very
clean
was
bare
and
cold
almost
emptied
by
the
drunken
habits
of
the
man
who
took
the
very
sheets
from
the
bed
to
turn
them
into
liquor
during
the
struggle
the
table
had
rolled
away
to
the
window
the
two
chairs
knocked
over
had
fallen
with
their
legs
in
the
air
in
the
middle
of
the
room
on
the
tile
floor
lay
madame
bijard
all
bloody
her
skirts
still
soaked
with
the
water
of
the
clinging
to
her
thighs
her
hair
straggling
in
disorder
she
was
breathing
heavily
with
a
rattle
in
her
throat
as
she
muttered
prolonged
ohs
each
time
she
received
a
blow
from
the
heel
of
bijard
boot
he
had
knocked
her
down
with
his
fists
and
now
he
stamped
upon
her
ah
strumpet
ah
strumpet
ah
strumpet
grunted
he
in
a
choking
voice
accompanying
each
blow
with
the
word
taking
a
delight
in
repeating
it
and
striking
all
the
harder
the
more
he
found
his
voice
failing
him
then
when
he
could
no
longer
speak
he
madly
continued
to
kick
with
a
dull
sound
rigid
in
his
ragged
blue
blouse
and
overalls
his
face
turned
purple
beneath
his
dirty
beard
and
his
bald
forehead
streaked
with
big
red
blotches
the
neighbors
on
the
landing
related
that
he
was
beating
her
because
she
had
refused
him
twenty
sous
that
morning
boche
voice
was
heard
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
he
was
calling
madame
boche
saying
come
down
let
them
kill
each
other
it
be
so
much
scum
the
less
meanwhile
pere
bru
had
followed
gervaise
into
the
room
between
them
they
were
trying
to
get
him
towards
the
door
but
he
turned
round
speechless
and
foaming
at
the
lips
and
in
his
pale
eyes
the
alcohol
was
blazing
with
a
murderous
glare
the
laundress
had
her
wrist
injured
the
old
workman
was
knocked
against
the
table
on
the
floor
madame
bijard
was
breathing
with
greater
difficulty
her
mouth
wide
open
her
eyes
closed
now
bijard
kept
missing
her
he
had
madly
returned
to
the
attack
but
blinded
by
rage
his
blows
fell
on
either
side
and
at
times
he
almost
fell
when
his
kicks
went
into
space
and
during
all
this
onslaught
gervaise
beheld
in
a
corner
of
the
room
little
lalie
then
four
years
old
watching
her
father
murdering
her
mother
the
child
held
in
her
arms
as
though
to
protect
her
her
sister
henriette
only
recently
weaned
she
was
standing
up
her
head
covered
with
a
cotton
cap
her
face
very
pale
and
grave
her
large
black
eyes
gazed
with
a
fixedness
full
of
thought
and
were
without
a
tear
when
at
length
bijard
running
against
a
chair
stumbled
onto
the
tiled
floor
where
they
left
him
snoring
pere
bru
helped
gervaise
to
raise
madame
bijard
the
latter
was
now
sobbing
bitterly
and
lalie
drawing
near
watched
her
crying
being
used
to
such
sights
and
already
resigned
to
them
as
the
laundress
descended
the
stairs
in
the
silence
of
the
now
quieted
house
she
kept
seeing
before
her
that
look
of
this
child
of
four
as
grave
and
courageous
as
that
of
a
woman
monsieur
coupeau
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
called
out
clemence
as
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
her
he
looks
awfully
drunk
coupeau
was
just
then
crossing
the
street
he
almost
smashed
a
pane
of
glass
with
his
shoulder
as
he
missed
the
door
he
was
in
a
state
of
complete
drunkenness
with
his
teeth
clinched
and
his
nose
inflamed
and
gervaise
at
once
recognized
the
vitriol
of
in
the
poisoned
blood
which
paled
his
skin
she
tried
to
joke
and
get
him
to
bed
the
same
as
on
the
days
when
the
wine
had
made
him
merry
but
he
pushed
her
aside
without
opening
his
lips
and
raised
his
fist
in
passing
as
he
went
to
bed
of
his
own
accord
he
made
gervaise
think
of
the
other
the
drunkard
who
was
snoring
upstairs
tired
out
by
the
blows
he
had
struck
a
cold
shiver
passed
over
her
she
thought
of
the
men
she
knew
of
her
husband
of
goujet
of
lantier
her
heart
breaking
despairing
of
ever
being
happy
chapter
vii
gervaise
saint
day
fell
on
the
of
june
on
such
occasions
the
coupeaus
always
made
a
grand
display
they
feasted
till
they
were
as
round
as
balls
and
their
stomachs
were
filled
for
the
rest
of
the
week
there
was
a
complete
clear
out
of
all
the
money
they
had
the
moment
there
were
a
few
sous
in
the
house
they
went
in
gorging
they
invented
saints
for
those
days
which
the
almanac
had
not
provided
with
any
just
for
the
sake
of
giving
themselves
a
pretext
for
gormandizing
virginie
highly
commended
gervaise
for
stuffing
herself
with
all
sorts
of
savory
dishes
when
one
has
a
husband
who
turns
all
he
can
lay
hands
on
into
drink
it
good
to
line
one
stomach
well
and
not
to
let
everything
go
off
in
liquids
since
the
money
would
disappear
anyway
surely
it
was
better
to
pay
it
to
the
butcher
gervaise
used
that
excuse
to
justify
overeating
saying
it
was
coupeau
fault
if
they
could
no
longer
save
a
sou
she
had
grown
considerably
fatter
and
she
limped
more
than
before
because
her
leg
now
swollen
with
fat
seemed
to
be
getting
gradually
shorter
that
year
they
talked
about
her
saint
day
a
good
month
beforehand
they
thought
of
dishes
and
smacked
their
lips
in
advance
all
the
shop
had
a
confounded
longing
to
junket
they
wanted
a
of
the
right
sort
something
out
of
the
ordinary
and
highly
successful
one
does
not
have
so
many
opportunities
for
enjoyment
what
most
troubled
the
laundress
was
to
decide
whom
to
invite
she
wished
to
have
twelve
persons
at
table
no
more
no
less
she
her
husband
mother
coupeau
and
madame
lerat
already
made
four
members
of
the
family
she
would
also
have
the
goujets
and
the
poissons
originally
she
had
decided
not
to
invite
her
workwomen
madame
putois
and
clemence
so
as
not
to
make
them
too
familiar
but
as
the
projected
feast
was
being
constantly
spoken
of
in
their
presence
and
their
mouths
watered
she
ended
by
telling
them
to
come
four
and
four
eight
and
two
are
ten
then
wishing
particularly
to
have
twelve
she
became
reconciled
with
the
lorilleuxs
who
for
some
time
past
had
been
hovering
around
her
at
least
it
was
agreed
that
the
lorilleuxs
should
come
to
dinner
and
that
peace
should
be
made
with
glasses
in
hand
you
really
keep
family
quarrels
going
forever
when
the
boches
heard
that
a
reconciliation
was
planned
they
also
sought
to
make
up
with
gervaise
and
so
they
had
to
be
invited
to
the
dinner
too
that
would
make
fourteen
not
counting
the
children
never
before
had
she
given
such
a
large
dinner
and
the
thought
frightened
and
excited
her
at
the
same
time
the
saint
day
happened
to
fall
on
a
monday
it
was
a
piece
of
luck
gervaise
counted
on
the
sunday
afternoon
to
begin
the
cooking
on
the
saturday
whilst
the
workwomen
hurried
with
their
work
there
was
a
long
discussion
in
the
shop
with
the
view
of
finally
deciding
upon
what
the
feast
should
consist
of
for
three
weeks
past
one
thing
alone
had
been
chosen
a
fat
roast
goose
there
was
a
gluttonous
look
on
every
face
whenever
it
was
mentioned
the
goose
was
even
already
bought
mother
coupeau
went
and
fetched
it
to
let
clemence
and
madame
putois
feel
its
weight
and
they
uttered
all
kinds
of
exclamations
it
looked
such
an
enormous
bird
with
its
rough
skin
all
swelled
out
with
yellow
fat
before
that
there
will
be
the
said
gervaise
the
soup
and
just
a
small
piece
of
boiled
beef
it
always
good
then
we
must
have
something
in
the
way
of
a
stew
tall
clemence
suggested
rabbit
but
they
were
always
having
that
everyone
was
sick
of
it
gervaise
wanted
something
more
distinguished
madame
putois
having
spoken
of
stewed
veal
they
looked
at
one
another
with
broad
smiles
it
was
a
real
idea
nothing
would
make
a
better
impression
than
a
veal
stew
and
after
that
resumed
gervaise
we
must
have
some
other
dish
with
a
sauce
mother
coupeau
proposed
fish
but
the
others
made
a
grimace
as
they
banged
down
their
irons
none
of
them
liked
fish
it
was
not
a
bit
satisfying
and
besides
that
it
was
full
of
bones
augustine
having
dared
to
observe
that
she
liked
skate
clemence
shut
her
mouth
for
her
with
a
good
sound
clout
at
length
the
mistress
thought
of
stewed
pig
back
and
potatoes
which
restored
the
smiles
to
every
countenance
then
virginie
entered
like
a
puff
of
wind
with
a
strange
look
on
her
face
you
come
just
at
the
right
time
exclaimed
gervaise
mother
coupeau
do
show
her
the
bird
and
mother
coupeau
went
a
second
time
and
fetched
the
goose
which
virginie
had
to
take
in
her
hands
she
uttered
no
end
of
exclamations
by
jove
it
was
heavy
but
she
soon
laid
it
down
on
the
between
a
petticoat
and
a
bundle
of
shirts
her
thoughts
were
elsewhere
she
dragged
gervaise
into
the
i
say
little
one
murmured
she
rapidly
i
come
to
warn
you
you
never
guess
who
i
just
met
at
the
corner
of
the
street
lantier
my
dear
he
hovering
about
on
the
watch
so
i
hastened
here
at
once
it
frightened
me
on
your
account
you
know
the
laundress
turned
quite
pale
what
could
the
wretched
man
want
with
her
coming
too
like
that
just
in
the
midst
of
the
preparations
for
the
feast
she
had
never
had
any
luck
she
could
not
even
be
allowed
to
enjoy
herself
quietly
but
virginie
replied
that
she
was
very
foolish
to
put
herself
out
about
it
like
that
why
if
lantier
dared
to
follow
her
about
all
she
had
to
do
was
to
call
a
policeman
and
have
him
locked
up
in
the
month
since
her
husband
had
been
appointed
a
policeman
virginie
had
assumed
rather
lordly
manners
and
talked
of
arresting
everybody
she
began
to
raise
her
voice
saying
that
she
wished
some
would
pinch
her
bottom
so
that
she
could
take
the
fresh
fellow
to
the
police
station
herself
and
turn
him
over
to
her
husband
gervaise
signaled
her
to
be
quiet
since
the
workwomen
were
listening
and
led
the
way
back
into
the
shop
reopening
the
discussion
about
the
dinner
now
do
we
need
a
vegetable
why
not
peas
with
bacon
said
virginie
i
like
nothing
better
yes
peas
with
bacon
the
others
approved
augustine
was
so
enthusiastic
that
she
jabbed
the
poker
into
the
stove
harder
than
ever
by
three
on
the
morrow
sunday
mother
coupeau
had
lighted
their
two
stoves
and
also
a
third
one
of
earthenware
which
they
had
borrowed
from
the
boches
at
three
the
was
boiling
away
in
an
enormous
earthenware
pot
lent
by
the
keeper
next
door
the
family
pot
having
been
found
too
small
they
had
decided
to
cook
the
veal
and
the
pig
back
the
night
before
since
both
of
those
dishes
are
better
when
reheated
but
the
cream
sauce
for
the
veal
would
not
be
prepared
until
just
before
sitting
down
for
the
feast
there
was
still
plenty
of
work
left
for
monday
the
soup
the
peas
with
bacon
the
roast
goose
the
inner
room
was
lit
by
three
fires
butter
was
sizzling
in
the
pans
and
emitting
a
sharp
odor
of
burnt
flour
mother
coupeau
and
gervaise
with
white
aprons
tied
on
were
bustling
all
around
cleaning
parsley
dashing
for
salt
and
pepper
turning
the
meat
they
had
sent
coupeau
away
so
as
not
to
have
him
underfoot
but
they
still
had
plenty
of
people
looking
in
throughout
the
afternoon
the
luscious
smells
from
the
kitchen
had
spread
through
the
entire
building
so
that
neighboring
ladies
came
into
the
shop
on
various
pretexts
very
curious
to
see
what
was
being
cooked
virginie
put
in
an
appearance
towards
five
she
had
again
seen
lantier
really
it
was
impossible
to
go
down
the
street
now
without
meeting
him
madame
boche
also
had
just
caught
sight
of
him
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
pavement
with
his
head
thrust
forward
in
an
uncommonly
sly
manner
then
gervaise
who
had
at
that
moment
intended
going
for
a
sou
worth
of
burnt
onions
for
the
began
to
tremble
from
head
to
foot
and
did
not
dare
leave
the
house
the
more
so
as
the
concierge
and
the
dressmaker
put
her
into
a
terrible
fright
by
relating
horrible
stories
of
men
waiting
for
women
with
knives
and
pistols
hidden
beneath
their
overcoats
well
yes
one
reads
of
such
things
every
day
in
the
newspapers
when
one
of
those
scoundrels
gets
his
monkey
up
on
discovering
an
old
love
leading
a
happy
life
he
becomes
capable
of
everything
virginie
obligingly
offered
to
run
and
fetch
the
burnt
onions
women
should
always
help
one
another
they
could
not
let
that
little
thing
be
murdered
when
she
returned
she
said
that
lantier
was
no
longer
there
he
had
probably
gone
off
on
finding
he
was
discovered
in
spite
of
that
thought
he
was
the
subject
of
conversation
around
the
saucepans
until
when
madame
boche
advised
her
to
inform
coupeau
gervaise
became
really
terrified
and
implored
her
not
to
say
a
word
about
it
oh
yes
would
that
be
a
nice
situation
her
husband
must
have
become
suspicious
already
because
for
the
last
few
days
at
night
he
would
swear
to
himself
and
bang
the
wall
with
his
fists
the
mere
thought
that
the
two
men
might
destroy
each
other
because
of
her
made
her
shudder
she
knew
that
coupeau
was
jealous
enough
to
attack
lantier
with
his
shears
while
the
four
of
them
had
been
deep
in
contemplating
this
drama
the
saucepans
on
the
banked
coals
of
the
stoves
had
been
quietly
simmering
when
mother
coupeau
lifted
the
lids
the
veal
and
the
pig
back
were
discreetly
bubbling
the
was
steadily
steaming
with
sounds
eventually
each
of
them
dipped
a
piece
of
bread
into
the
soup
to
taste
the
bouillon
at
length
monday
arrived
now
that
gervaise
was
going
to
have
fourteen
persons
at
table
she
began
to
fear
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
find
room
for
them
all
she
decided
that
they
should
dine
in
the
shop
and
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
she
took
measurements
so
as
to
settle
which
way
she
should
place
the
table
after
that
they
had
to
remove
all
the
clothes
and
take
the
to
pieces
the
top
of
this
laid
on
to
some
shorter
trestles
was
to
be
the
but
just
in
the
midst
of
all
this
moving
a
customer
appeared
and
made
a
scene
because
she
had
been
waiting
for
her
washing
ever
since
the
friday
they
were
humbugging
her
she
would
have
her
things
at
once
then
gervaise
tried
to
excuse
herself
and
lied
boldly
it
was
not
her
fault
she
was
cleaning
out
her
shop
the
workmen
would
not
be
there
till
the
morrow
and
she
pacified
her
customer
and
got
rid
of
her
by
promising
to
busy
herself
with
her
things
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
then
as
soon
as
the
woman
had
left
she
showed
her
temper
really
if
you
listened
to
all
your
customers
you
never
have
time
to
eat
you
could
work
yourself
to
death
like
a
dog
on
a
leash
well
no
matter
who
came
in
even
if
they
offered
one
hundred
thousand
francs
she
touch
an
iron
on
this
monday
because
it
was
her
turn
to
enjoy
herself
the
entire
morning
was
spent
in
completing
the
purchases
three
times
gervaise
went
out
and
returned
laden
like
a
mule
but
just
as
she
was
going
to
order
wine
she
noticed
that
she
had
not
sufficient
money
left
she
could
easily
have
got
it
on
credit
only
she
could
not
be
without
money
in
the
house
on
account
of
the
thousand
little
expenses
that
one
is
liable
to
forget
and
mother
coupeau
and
she
had
lamented
together
in
the
as
they
reckoned
that
they
required
at
least
twenty
francs
how
could
they
obtain
them
those
four
pieces
of
a
hundred
sous
each
mother
coupeau
who
had
at
one
time
done
the
charring
for
a
little
actress
of
the
theatre
des
batignolles
was
the
first
to
suggest
the
gervaise
laughed
with
relief
how
stupid
she
was
not
to
have
thought
of
it
she
quickly
folded
her
black
silk
dress
upon
a
towel
which
she
then
pinned
together
then
she
hid
the
bundle
under
mother
coupeau
apron
telling
her
to
keep
it
very
flat
against
her
stomach
on
account
of
the
neighbors
who
had
no
need
to
know
and
she
went
and
watched
at
the
door
to
see
that
the
old
woman
was
not
followed
but
the
latter
had
only
gone
as
far
as
the
charcoal
dealer
when
she
called
her
back
mamma
mamma
she
made
her
return
to
the
shop
and
taking
her
off
her
finger
said
here
put
this
with
it
we
shall
get
all
the
more
when
mother
coupeau
brought
her
francs
she
danced
for
joy
she
would
order
an
extra
six
bottles
of
wine
sealed
wine
to
drink
with
the
roast
the
lorilleuxs
would
be
crushed
for
a
fortnight
past
it
had
been
the
coupeaus
dream
to
crush
the
lorilleuxs
was
it
not
true
that
those
sly
ones
the
man
and
his
wife
a
truly
pretty
couple
shut
themselves
up
whenever
they
had
anything
nice
to
eat
as
though
they
had
stolen
it
yes
they
covered
up
the
window
with
a
blanket
to
hide
the
light
and
make
believe
that
they
were
already
asleep
in
bed
this
stopped
anyone
from
coming
up
and
so
the
lorilleuxs
could
stuff
everything
down
just
the
two
of
them
they
were
even
careful
the
next
day
not
to
throw
the
bones
into
the
garbage
so
that
no
one
would
know
what
they
had
eaten
madame
lorilleux
would
walk
to
the
end
of
the
street
to
toss
them
into
a
sewer
opening
one
morning
gervaise
surprised
her
emptying
a
basket
of
oyster
shells
there
oh
those
were
never
and
all
their
mean
contrivances
came
from
their
desire
to
appear
to
be
poor
well
show
them
we
prove
to
them
that
we
were
mean
gervaise
would
have
laid
her
table
in
the
street
had
she
been
able
to
just
for
the
sake
of
inviting
each
money
was
not
invented
that
it
should
be
allowed
to
grow
moldy
was
it
it
is
pretty
when
it
shines
all
new
in
the
sunshine
she
resembled
them
so
little
now
that
on
the
days
when
she
had
twenty
sous
she
arranged
things
to
let
people
think
that
she
had
forty
mother
coupeau
and
gervaise
talked
of
the
lorilleuxs
whilst
they
laid
the
cloth
about
three
they
had
hung
some
big
curtains
at
the
windows
but
as
it
was
very
warm
the
door
was
left
open
and
the
whole
street
passed
in
front
of
the
little
table
the
two
women
did
not
place
a
decanter
or
a
bottle
or
a
without
trying
to
arrange
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
annoy
the
lorilleuxs
they
had
arranged
their
seats
so
as
to
give
them
a
full
view
of
the
superbly
laid
cloth
and
they
had
reserved
the
best
crockery
for
them
well
knowing
that
the
porcelain
plates
would
create
a
great
effect
no
no
mamma
cried
gervaise
do
give
them
those
napkins
two
damask
ones
ah
good
murmured
the
old
woman
that
break
their
hearts
certain
and
they
smiled
to
each
other
as
they
stood
up
on
either
side
of
that
big
white
table
on
which
the
fourteen
knives
and
forks
placed
all
round
caused
them
to
swell
with
pride
it
had
the
appearance
of
the
altar
of
some
chapel
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
that
because
they
so
stingy
themselves
resumed
gervaise
you
know
they
lied
last
month
when
the
woman
went
about
everywhere
saying
that
she
had
lost
a
piece
of
gold
chain
as
she
was
taking
the
work
home
the
idea
there
no
fear
of
her
ever
losing
anything
it
was
simply
a
way
of
making
themselves
out
very
poor
and
of
not
giving
you
your
five
francs
as
yet
i
only
seen
my
five
francs
twice
said
mother
coupeau
i
bet
next
month
they
concoct
some
other
story
that
explains
why
they
cover
their
window
up
when
they
have
a
rabbit
to
eat
you
see
one
would
have
the
right
to
say
to
them
you
can
afford
a
rabbit
you
can
certainly
give
five
francs
to
your
mother
oh
just
rotten
what
would
have
become
of
you
if
i
had
taken
you
to
live
with
us
mother
coupeau
slowly
shook
her
head
that
day
she
was
all
against
the
lorilleuxs
because
of
the
great
feast
the
coupeaus
were
giving
she
loved
cooking
the
little
gossipings
round
the
saucepans
the
place
turned
by
the
revels
of
saints
days
besides
she
generally
got
on
pretty
well
with
gervaise
on
other
days
when
they
plagued
one
another
as
happens
in
all
families
the
old
woman
grumbled
saying
she
was
wretchedly
unfortunate
in
thus
being
at
her
mercy
in
point
of
fact
she
probably
had
some
affection
for
madame
lorilleux
who
after
all
was
her
daughter
ah
continued
gervaise
you
would
be
so
fat
would
you
if
you
were
living
with
them
and
no
coffee
no
snuff
no
little
luxuries
of
any
sort
tell
me
would
they
have
given
you
two
mattresses
to
your
bed
no
that
very
certain
replied
mother
coupeau
when
they
arrive
i
shall
place
myself
so
as
to
have
a
good
view
of
the
door
to
see
the
faces
they
make
thinking
of
the
faces
they
would
make
gave
them
pleasure
ahead
of
time
however
they
could
remain
standing
there
admiring
the
table
the
coupeaus
had
lunched
very
late
on
just
a
bite
or
two
because
the
stoves
were
already
in
use
and
because
they
did
not
want
to
dirty
any
dishes
needed
for
the
evening
by
four
the
two
women
were
working
very
hard
the
huge
goose
was
being
cooked
on
a
spit
augustine
was
sitting
on
a
low
bench
solemnly
basting
the
goose
with
a
spoon
gervaise
was
busy
with
the
peas
with
bacon
mother
coupeau
kept
spinning
around
a
bit
confused
waiting
for
the
right
time
to
begin
reheating
the
pork
and
the
veal
towards
five
the
guests
began
to
arrive
first
of
all
came
the
two
workwomen
clemence
and
madame
putois
both
in
their
sunday
best
the
former
in
blue
the
latter
in
black
clemence
carried
a
geranium
madame
putois
a
heliotrope
and
gervaise
whose
hands
were
just
then
smothered
with
flour
had
to
kiss
each
of
them
on
both
cheeks
with
her
arms
behind
her
back
then
following
close
upon
their
heels
entered
virginie
dressed
like
a
lady
in
a
printed
muslin
costume
with
a
sash
and
a
bonnet
though
she
had
only
a
few
steps
to
come
she
brought
a
pot
of
red
carnations
she
took
the
laundress
in
her
big
arms
and
squeezed
her
tight
at
length
boche
appeared
with
a
pot
of
pansies
and
madame
boche
with
a
pot
of
mignonette
then
came
madame
lerat
with
a
the
pot
of
which
had
dirtied
her
violet
merino
dress
all
these
people
kissed
each
other
and
gathered
together
in
the
in
the
midst
of
the
three
stoves
and
the
roasting
apparatus
which
gave
out
a
stifling
heat
the
noise
from
the
saucepans
drowned
the
voices
a
dress
catching
in
the
dutch
oven
caused
quite
an
emotion
the
smell
of
roast
goose
was
so
strong
that
it
made
their
mouths
water
and
gervaise
was
very
pleasant
thanking
everyone
for
their
flowers
without
however
letting
that
interfere
with
her
preparing
the
thickening
for
the
stewed
veal
at
the
bottom
of
a
soup
plate
she
had
placed
the
pots
in
the
shop
at
one
end
of
the
table
without
removing
the
white
paper
that
was
round
them
a
sweet
scent
of
flowers
mingled
with
the
odor
of
cooking
do
you
want
any
assistance
asked
virginie
just
fancy
you
been
three
days
preparing
all
this
feast
and
it
will
be
gobbled
up
in
no
time
well
you
know
replied
gervaise
it
would
prepare
itself
no
do
dirty
your
hands
you
see
everything
ready
there
only
the
soup
to
warm
then
they
all
made
themselves
comfortable
the
ladies
laid
their
shawls
and
their
caps
on
the
bed
and
pinned
up
their
skirts
so
as
not
to
soil
them
boche
sent
his
wife
back
to
the
concierge
lodge
until
time
to
eat
and
had
cornered
clemence
in
a
corner
trying
to
find
out
if
she
was
ticklish
she
was
gasping
for
breath
as
the
mere
thought
of
being
tickled
sent
shivers
through
her
so
as
not
to
bother
the
cooks
the
other
ladies
had
gone
into
the
shop
and
were
standing
against
the
wall
facing
the
table
they
were
talking
through
the
door
though
and
as
they
could
not
hear
very
well
they
were
continually
invading
the
and
crowding
around
gervaise
who
would
forget
what
she
was
doing
to
answer
them
there
were
a
few
stories
which
brought
sly
laughter
when
virginie
mentioned
that
she
had
eaten
for
two
days
in
order
to
have
more
room
for
today
feast
tall
clemence
said
that
she
had
cleaned
herself
out
that
morning
with
an
enema
like
the
english
do
then
boche
suggested
a
way
of
digesting
the
food
quickly
by
squeezing
oneself
after
each
course
another
english
custom
after
all
when
you
were
invited
to
dinner
was
it
polite
to
eat
as
much
as
you
could
veal
and
pork
and
goose
are
placed
out
for
the
cats
to
eat
the
hostess
did
need
to
worry
a
bit
they
were
going
to
clean
their
plates
so
thoroughly
that
she
would
have
to
wash
them
all
of
them
kept
coming
to
smell
the
air
above
the
saucepans
and
the
roaster
the
ladies
began
to
act
like
young
girls
scurrying
from
room
to
room
and
pushing
each
other
just
as
they
were
all
jumping
about
and
shouting
by
way
of
amusement
goujet
appeared
he
was
so
timid
he
scarcely
dared
enter
but
stood
still
holding
a
tall
white
in
his
arms
a
magnificent
plant
with
a
stem
that
reached
to
his
face
and
entangled
the
flowers
in
his
beard
gervaise
ran
to
him
her
cheeks
burning
from
the
heat
of
the
stoves
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
get
rid
of
his
pot
and
when
she
had
taken
it
from
his
hands
he
stammered
not
daring
to
kiss
her
it
was
she
who
was
obliged
to
stand
on
and
place
her
cheek
against
his
lips
he
was
so
agitated
that
even
then
he
kissed
her
roughly
on
the
eye
almost
blinding
her
they
both
stood
trembling
oh
monsieur
goujet
it
too
lovely
said
she
placing
the
beside
the
other
flowers
which
it
overtopped
with
the
whole
of
its
tuft
of
foliage
not
at
all
not
at
all
repeated
he
unable
to
say
anything
else
then
after
sighing
deeply
he
slightly
recovered
himself
and
stated
that
she
was
not
to
expect
his
mother
she
was
suffering
from
an
attack
of
sciatica
gervaise
was
greatly
grieved
she
talked
of
putting
a
piece
of
the
goose
on
one
side
as
she
particularly
wished
madame
goujet
to
have
a
taste
of
the
bird
no
one
else
was
expected
coupeau
was
no
doubt
strolling
about
in
the
neighborhood
with
poisson
whom
he
had
called
for
directly
after
his
lunch
they
would
be
home
directly
they
had
promised
to
be
back
punctually
at
six
then
as
the
soup
was
almost
ready
gervaise
called
to
madame
lerat
saying
that
she
thought
it
was
time
to
go
and
fetch
the
lorilleuxs
madame
lerat
became
at
once
very
grave
it
was
she
who
had
conducted
all
the
negotiations
and
who
had
settled
how
everything
should
pass
between
the
two
families
she
put
her
cap
and
shawl
on
again
and
went
upstairs
very
stiffly
in
her
skirts
looking
very
stately
down
below
the
laundress
continued
to
stir
her
vermicelli
soup
without
saying
a
word
the
guests
suddenly
became
serious
and
solemnly
waited
it
was
madame
lerat
who
appeared
first
she
had
gone
round
by
the
street
so
as
to
give
more
pomp
to
the
reconciliation
she
held
the
wide
open
whilst
madame
lorilleux
wearing
a
silk
dress
stopped
at
the
threshold
all
the
guests
had
risen
from
their
seats
gervaise
went
forward
and
kissing
her
as
had
been
agreed
said
come
in
it
all
over
is
it
we
both
be
nice
to
each
other
and
madame
lorilleux
replied
i
shall
be
only
too
happy
if
we
so
always
when
she
had
entered
lorilleux
also
stopped
at
the
threshold
and
he
likewise
waited
to
be
embraced
before
penetrating
into
the
shop
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
had
brought
a
bouquet
they
had
decided
not
to
do
so
as
they
thought
it
would
look
too
much
like
giving
way
to
if
they
carried
flowers
with
them
the
first
time
they
set
foot
in
her
home
gervaise
called
to
augustine
to
bring
two
bottles
of
wine
then
filling
some
glasses
on
a
corner
of
the
table
she
called
everyone
to
her
and
each
took
a
glass
and
drank
to
the
good
friendship
of
the
family
there
was
a
pause
whilst
the
guests
were
drinking
the
ladies
raising
their
elbows
and
emptying
their
glasses
to
the
last
drop
nothing
is
better
before
soup
declared
boche
smacking
his
lips
mother
coupeau
had
placed
herself
opposite
the
door
to
see
the
faces
the
lorilleuxs
would
make
she
pulled
gervaise
by
the
skirt
and
dragged
her
into
the
and
as
they
both
leant
over
the
soup
they
conversed
rapidly
in
a
low
voice
huh
what
a
sight
said
the
old
woman
you
could
see
them
but
i
was
watching
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
table
her
face
twisted
around
like
that
the
corners
of
her
mouth
almost
touched
her
eyes
and
as
for
him
it
nearly
choked
him
he
coughed
and
coughed
now
just
look
at
them
over
there
they
no
saliva
left
in
their
mouths
they
chewing
their
lips
it
quite
painful
to
see
people
as
jealous
as
that
murmured
gervaise
really
the
lorilleuxs
had
a
funny
look
about
them
no
one
of
course
likes
to
be
crushed
in
families
especially
when
the
one
succeeds
the
others
do
not
like
it
that
is
only
natural
only
one
keeps
it
in
one
does
not
make
an
exhibition
of
oneself
well
the
lorilleuxs
could
not
keep
it
in
it
was
more
than
a
match
for
them
they
squinted
their
mouths
were
all
on
one
side
in
short
it
was
so
apparent
that
the
other
guests
looked
at
them
and
asked
them
if
they
were
unwell
never
would
they
be
able
to
stomach
this
table
with
its
fourteen
its
white
linen
table
cloth
its
slices
of
bread
cut
in
advance
all
in
the
style
of
a
restaurant
mme
lorilleux
went
around
the
table
surreptitiously
fingering
the
table
cloth
tortured
by
the
thought
that
it
was
a
new
one
everything
ready
cried
gervaise
as
she
reappeared
with
a
smile
her
arms
bare
and
her
little
fair
curls
blowing
over
her
temples
if
the
boss
would
only
come
resumed
the
laundress
we
might
begin
ah
well
said
madame
lorilleux
the
soup
will
be
cold
by
then
coupeau
always
forgets
you
should
have
let
him
go
off
it
was
already
six
everything
was
burning
now
the
goose
would
be
overdone
then
gervaise
feeling
quite
dejected
talked
of
sending
someone
to
all
the
wineshops
in
the
neighborhood
to
find
coupeau
and
as
goujet
offered
to
go
she
decided
to
accompany
him
virginie
anxious
about
her
husband
went
also
the
three
of
them
bareheaded
quite
blocked
up
the
pavement
the
blacksmith
who
wore
his
had
gervaise
on
his
left
arm
and
virginie
on
his
right
he
was
doing
the
basket
as
he
said
and
it
seemed
to
them
such
a
funny
thing
to
say
that
they
stopped
unable
to
move
their
legs
for
laughing
they
looked
at
themselves
in
the
glass
and
laughed
more
than
ever
beside
goujet
all
in
black
the
two
women
looked
like
two
speckled
hens
the
dressmaker
in
her
muslin
costume
sprinkled
with
pink
flowers
the
laundress
in
her
white
cambric
dress
with
blue
spots
her
wrists
bare
and
wearing
round
her
neck
a
little
grey
silk
scarf
tied
in
a
bow
people
turned
round
to
see
them
pass
looking
so
fresh
and
lively
dressed
in
their
sunday
best
on
a
week
day
and
jostling
the
crowd
which
hung
about
the
rue
des
poissonniers
on
that
warm
june
evening
but
it
was
not
a
question
of
amusing
themselves
they
went
straight
to
the
door
of
each
wineshop
looked
in
and
sought
amongst
the
people
standing
before
the
counter
had
that
animal
coupeau
gone
to
the
arc
de
triomphe
to
get
his
dram
they
had
already
done
the
upper
part
of
the
street
looking
in
at
all
the
likely
places
at
the
little
civet
renowned
for
its
preserved
plums
at
old
mother
baquet
who
sold
orleans
wine
at
eight
sous
at
the
butterfly
the
coachmen
house
of
call
gentlemen
who
were
not
easy
to
please
but
no
coupeau
then
as
they
were
going
down
towards
the
boulevard
gervaise
uttered
a
faint
cry
on
passing
the
at
the
corner
kept
by
francois
what
the
matter
asked
goujet
the
laundress
no
longer
laughed
she
was
very
pale
and
laboring
under
so
great
an
emotion
that
she
had
almost
fallen
virginie
understood
it
all
as
she
caught
a
sight
of
lantier
seated
at
one
of
francois
tables
quietly
dining
the
two
women
dragged
the
blacksmith
along
my
ankle
twisted
said
gervaise
as
soon
as
she
was
able
to
speak
at
length
they
discovered
coupeau
and
poisson
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
inside
pere
colombe
they
were
standing
up
in
the
midst
of
a
number
of
men
coupeau
in
a
grey
blouse
was
shouting
with
furious
gestures
and
banging
his
fists
down
on
the
counter
poisson
not
on
duty
that
day
and
buttoned
up
in
an
old
brown
coat
was
listening
to
him
in
a
dull
sort
of
way
and
without
uttering
a
word
bristling
his
carroty
moustaches
and
beard
the
while
goujet
left
the
women
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
and
went
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
but
when
the
latter
caught
sight
of
gervaise
and
virginie
outside
he
grew
angry
why
was
he
badgered
with
such
females
as
those
petticoats
had
taken
to
tracking
him
about
now
well
he
declined
to
stir
they
could
go
and
eat
their
beastly
dinner
all
by
themselves
to
quiet
him
goujet
was
obliged
to
accept
a
drop
of
something
and
even
then
coupeau
took
a
fiendish
delight
in
dawdling
a
good
five
minutes
at
the
counter
when
he
at
length
came
out
he
said
to
his
wife
i
do
like
this
it
my
business
where
i
go
do
you
understand
she
did
not
answer
she
was
all
in
a
tremble
she
must
have
said
something
about
lantier
to
virginie
for
the
latter
pushed
her
husband
and
goujet
ahead
telling
them
to
walk
in
front
the
two
women
got
on
each
side
of
coupeau
to
keep
him
occupied
and
prevent
him
seeing
lantier
he
was
really
drunk
being
more
intoxicated
from
shouting
than
from
drinking
since
they
seemed
to
want
to
stay
on
the
left
side
to
tease
them
he
crossed
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
worried
they
ran
after
him
and
tried
to
block
his
view
of
the
door
of
francois
but
coupeau
must
have
known
that
lantier
was
there
gervaise
almost
went
out
of
her
senses
on
hearing
him
grunt
yes
my
duck
there
a
young
fellow
of
our
acquaintance
inside
there
you
must
take
me
for
a
ninny
do
let
me
catch
you
gallivanting
about
again
with
your
side
glances
and
he
made
use
of
some
very
coarse
expressions
it
was
not
him
that
she
had
come
to
look
for
with
her
bare
elbows
and
her
mealy
mouth
it
was
her
old
beau
then
he
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
mad
rage
against
lantier
ah
the
brigand
ah
the
filthy
hound
one
or
the
other
of
them
would
have
to
be
left
on
the
pavement
emptied
of
his
guts
like
a
rabbit
lantier
however
did
not
appear
to
notice
what
was
going
on
and
continued
slowly
eating
some
veal
and
sorrel
a
crowd
began
to
form
virginie
led
coupeau
away
and
he
calmed
down
at
once
as
soon
as
he
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
all
the
same
they
returned
to
the
shop
far
less
lively
than
when
they
left
it
the
guests
were
standing
round
the
table
with
very
long
faces
the
shook
hands
with
them
showing
himself
off
before
the
ladies
gervaise
feeling
rather
depressed
spoke
in
a
low
voice
as
she
directed
them
to
their
places
but
she
suddenly
noticed
that
as
madame
goujet
had
not
come
a
seat
would
remain
empty
the
one
next
to
madame
lorilleux
we
are
thirteen
said
she
deeply
affected
seeing
in
that
a
fresh
omen
of
the
misfortune
with
which
she
had
felt
herself
threatened
for
some
time
past
the
ladies
already
seated
rose
up
looking
anxious
and
annoyed
madame
putois
offered
to
retire
because
according
to
her
it
was
not
a
matter
to
laugh
about
besides
she
would
not
touch
a
thing
the
food
would
do
her
no
good
as
to
boche
he
chuckled
he
would
sooner
be
thirteen
than
fourteen
the
portions
would
be
larger
that
was
all
wait
resumed
gervaise
i
can
manage
it
and
going
out
on
to
the
pavement
she
called
pere
bru
who
was
just
then
crossing
the
roadway
the
old
workman
entered
stooping
and
stiff
and
his
face
without
expression
seat
yourself
there
my
good
fellow
said
the
laundress
you
mind
eating
with
us
will
you
he
simply
nodded
his
head
he
was
willing
he
did
not
mind
as
well
him
as
another
continued
she
lowering
her
voice
he
often
eat
his
fill
he
will
at
least
enjoy
himself
once
more
we
shall
feel
no
remorse
in
stuffing
ourselves
now
this
touched
goujet
so
deeply
that
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
the
others
were
also
moved
by
compassion
and
said
that
it
would
bring
them
all
good
luck
however
madame
lorilleux
seemed
unhappy
at
having
the
old
man
next
to
her
she
cast
glances
of
disgust
at
his
hands
and
his
faded
patched
smock
and
drew
away
from
him
pere
bru
sat
with
his
head
bowed
waiting
he
was
bothered
by
the
napkin
that
was
on
the
plate
before
him
finally
he
lifted
it
off
and
placed
it
gently
on
the
edge
of
the
table
not
thinking
to
spread
it
over
his
knees
now
at
last
gervaise
served
the
vermicelli
soup
the
guests
were
taking
up
their
spoons
when
virginie
remarked
that
coupeau
had
disappeared
he
had
perhaps
returned
to
pere
colombe
this
time
the
company
got
angry
so
much
the
worse
one
would
not
run
after
him
he
could
stay
in
the
street
if
he
was
not
hungry
and
as
the
spoons
touched
the
bottom
of
the
plates
coupeau
reappeared
with
two
pots
of
flowers
one
under
each
arm
a
stock
and
a
balsam
they
all
clapped
their
hands
he
gallantly
placed
the
pots
one
on
the
right
the
other
on
the
left
of
gervaise
glass
then
bending
over
and
kissing
her
he
said
i
had
forgotten
you
my
lamb
but
in
spite
of
that
we
love
each
other
all
the
same
especially
on
such
a
day
as
this
monsieur
coupeau
very
nice
this
evening
murmured
clemence
in
boche
ear
he
just
got
what
he
required
sufficient
to
make
him
amiable
the
good
behavior
of
the
master
of
the
house
restored
the
gaiety
of
the
proceedings
which
at
one
moment
had
been
compromised
gervaise
once
more
at
her
ease
was
all
smiles
again
the
guests
finished
their
soup
then
the
bottles
circulated
and
they
drank
their
first
glass
of
wine
just
a
drop
pure
to
wash
down
the
vermicelli
one
could
hear
the
children
quarrelling
in
the
next
room
there
were
etienne
pauline
nana
and
little
victor
fauconnier
it
had
been
decided
to
lay
a
table
for
the
four
of
them
and
they
had
been
told
to
be
very
good
that
augustine
who
had
to
look
after
the
stoves
was
to
eat
off
her
knees
mamma
mamma
suddenly
screamed
nana
augustine
is
dipping
her
bread
in
the
dutch
oven
the
laundress
hastened
there
and
caught
the
one
in
the
act
of
burning
her
throat
in
her
attempts
to
swallow
without
loss
of
time
a
slice
of
bread
soaked
in
boiling
goose
fat
she
boxed
her
ears
when
the
young
monkey
called
out
that
it
was
not
true
when
after
the
boiled
beef
the
stewed
veal
appeared
served
in
a
as
they
did
not
have
a
dish
large
enough
the
party
greeted
it
with
a
laugh
it
becoming
serious
declared
poisson
who
seldom
spoke
it
was
seven
they
had
closed
the
shop
door
so
as
not
to
be
spied
upon
by
the
whole
neighborhood
the
little
clockmaker
opposite
especially
was
opening
his
eyes
to
their
full
size
and
seemed
to
take
the
pieces
from
their
mouths
with
such
a
gluttonous
look
that
it
almost
prevented
them
from
eating
the
curtains
hung
before
the
windows
admitted
a
great
white
uniform
light
which
bathed
the
entire
table
with
its
symmetrical
arrangement
of
knives
and
forks
and
its
pots
of
flowers
enveloped
in
tall
collars
of
white
paper
and
this
pale
fading
light
this
slowly
approaching
dusk
gave
to
the
party
somewhat
of
an
air
of
distinction
virginie
looked
round
the
closed
apartment
hung
with
muslin
and
with
a
happy
criticism
declared
it
to
be
very
cozy
whenever
a
cart
passed
in
the
street
the
glasses
jingled
together
on
the
table
cloth
and
the
ladies
were
obliged
to
shout
out
as
loud
as
the
men
but
there
was
not
much
conversation
they
all
behaved
very
respectably
and
were
very
attentive
to
each
other
coupeau
alone
wore
a
blouse
because
as
he
said
one
need
not
stand
on
ceremony
with
friends
and
besides
which
the
blouse
was
the
workman
garb
of
honor
the
ladies
laced
up
in
their
bodices
wore
their
hair
in
plaits
greasy
with
pomatum
in
which
the
daylight
was
reflected
whilst
the
gentlemen
sitting
at
a
distance
from
the
table
swelled
out
their
chests
and
kept
their
elbows
wide
apart
for
fear
of
staining
their
frock
coats
ah
thunder
what
a
hole
they
were
making
in
the
stewed
veal
if
they
spoke
little
they
were
chewing
in
earnest
the
was
becoming
emptier
and
emptier
with
a
spoon
stuck
in
the
midst
of
the
thick
sauce
a
good
yellow
sauce
which
quivered
like
a
jelly
they
fished
pieces
of
veal
out
of
it
and
seemed
as
though
they
would
never
come
to
the
end
the
journeyed
from
hand
to
hand
and
faces
bent
over
it
as
forks
picked
out
the
mushrooms
the
long
loaves
standing
against
the
wall
behind
the
guests
appeared
to
melt
away
between
the
mouthfuls
one
could
hear
the
sound
of
glasses
being
replaced
on
the
table
the
sauce
was
a
trifle
too
salty
it
required
four
bottles
of
wine
to
drown
that
blessed
stewed
veal
which
went
down
like
cream
but
which
afterwards
lit
up
a
regular
conflagration
in
one
stomach
and
before
one
had
time
to
take
a
breath
the
pig
back
in
the
middle
of
a
deep
dish
surrounded
by
big
round
potatoes
arrived
in
the
midst
of
a
cloud
of
smoke
there
was
one
general
cry
by
jove
it
was
just
the
thing
everyone
liked
it
they
would
do
it
justice
and
they
followed
the
dish
with
a
side
glance
as
they
wiped
their
knives
on
their
bread
so
as
to
be
in
readiness
then
as
soon
as
they
were
helped
they
nudged
one
another
and
spoke
with
their
mouths
full
it
was
just
like
butter
something
sweet
and
solid
which
one
could
feel
run
through
one
guts
right
down
into
one
boots
the
potatoes
were
like
sugar
it
was
not
a
bit
salty
only
just
on
account
of
the
potatoes
it
required
a
wetting
every
few
minutes
four
more
bottles
were
placed
on
the
table
the
plates
were
wiped
so
clean
that
they
also
served
for
the
green
peas
and
bacon
oh
vegetables
were
of
no
consequence
they
playfully
gulped
them
down
in
spoonfuls
the
best
part
of
the
dish
was
the
small
pieces
of
bacon
just
nicely
grilled
and
smelling
like
horse
hoof
two
bottles
were
sufficient
for
them
mamma
mamma
called
out
nana
suddenly
augustine
putting
her
fingers
in
my
plate
do
bother
me
give
her
a
slap
replied
gervaise
in
the
act
of
stuffing
herself
with
green
peas
at
the
children
table
in
the
nana
was
playing
the
role
of
lady
of
the
house
sitting
next
to
victor
and
putting
her
brother
etienne
beside
pauline
so
they
could
play
house
pretending
they
were
two
married
couples
nana
had
served
her
guests
very
politely
at
first
but
now
she
had
given
way
to
her
passion
for
grilled
bacon
trying
to
keep
every
piece
for
herself
while
augustine
was
prowling
around
the
children
table
she
would
grab
the
bits
of
bacon
under
the
pretext
of
dividing
them
amongst
the
children
nana
was
so
furious
that
she
bit
augustine
on
the
wrist
ah
you
know
murmured
augustine
i
tell
your
mother
that
after
the
veal
you
asked
victor
to
kiss
you
but
all
became
quiet
again
as
gervaise
and
mother
coupeau
came
in
to
get
the
goose
the
guests
at
the
big
table
were
leaning
back
in
their
chairs
taking
a
breather
the
men
had
unbuttoned
their
waistcoats
the
ladies
were
wiping
their
faces
with
their
napkins
the
repast
was
so
to
say
interrupted
only
one
or
two
persons
unable
to
keep
their
jaws
still
continued
to
swallow
large
mouthfuls
of
bread
without
even
knowing
that
they
were
doing
so
the
others
were
waiting
and
allowing
their
food
to
settle
while
waiting
for
the
main
course
night
was
slowly
coming
on
a
dirty
ashy
grey
light
was
gathering
behind
the
curtains
when
augustine
brought
two
lamps
and
placed
one
at
each
end
of
the
table
the
general
disorder
became
apparent
in
the
bright
glare
the
greasy
forks
and
plates
the
table
cloth
stained
with
wine
and
covered
with
crumbs
a
strong
stifling
odor
pervaded
the
room
certain
warm
fumes
however
attracted
all
the
noses
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
can
i
help
you
cried
virginie
she
left
her
chair
and
passed
into
the
inner
room
all
the
women
followed
one
by
one
they
surrounded
the
dutch
oven
and
watched
with
profound
interest
as
gervaise
and
mother
coupeau
tried
to
pull
the
bird
out
then
a
clamor
arose
in
the
midst
of
which
one
could
distinguish
the
shrill
voices
and
the
joyful
leaps
of
the
children
and
there
was
a
triumphal
entry
gervaise
carried
the
goose
her
arms
stiff
and
her
perspiring
face
expanded
in
one
broad
silent
laugh
the
women
walked
behind
her
laughing
in
the
same
way
whilst
nana
right
at
the
end
raised
herself
up
to
see
her
eyes
open
to
their
full
extent
when
the
enormous
golden
goose
streaming
with
gravy
was
on
the
table
they
did
not
attack
it
at
once
it
was
a
wonder
a
respectful
wonderment
which
for
a
moment
left
everyone
speechless
they
drew
one
another
attention
to
it
with
winks
and
nods
of
the
head
golly
what
a
bird
that
one
did
get
fat
by
licking
the
walls
i
bet
said
boche
then
they
entered
into
details
respecting
the
bird
gervaise
gave
the
facts
it
was
the
best
she
could
get
at
the
poulterer
in
the
faubourg
poissonniers
it
weighed
twelve
and
a
half
pounds
on
the
scales
at
the
they
had
burnt
nearly
half
a
bushel
of
charcoal
in
cooking
it
and
it
had
given
three
bowls
full
of
drippings
virginie
interrupted
her
to
boast
of
having
seen
it
before
it
was
cooked
you
could
have
eaten
it
just
as
it
was
she
said
its
skin
was
so
fine
like
the
skin
of
a
blonde
all
the
men
laughed
at
this
smacking
their
lips
lorilleux
and
madame
lorilleux
sniffed
disdainfully
almost
choking
with
rage
to
see
such
a
goose
on
table
well
we
ca
eat
it
whole
the
laundress
observed
who
cut
it
up
no
no
not
me
it
too
big
i
afraid
of
it
coupeau
offered
his
services
dieu
it
was
very
simple
you
caught
hold
of
the
limbs
and
pulled
them
off
the
pieces
were
good
all
the
same
but
the
others
protested
they
forcibly
took
possession
of
the
large
kitchen
knife
which
the
already
held
in
his
hand
saying
that
whenever
he
carved
he
made
a
regular
graveyard
of
the
platter
finally
madame
lerat
suggested
in
a
friendly
tone
listen
it
should
be
monsieur
poisson
yes
monsieur
poisson
but
as
the
others
did
not
appear
to
understand
she
added
in
a
more
flattering
manner
still
why
yes
of
course
it
should
be
monsieur
poisson
who
accustomed
to
the
use
of
arms
and
she
passed
the
kitchen
knife
to
the
policeman
all
round
the
table
they
laughed
with
pleasure
and
approval
poisson
bowed
his
head
with
military
stiffness
and
moved
the
goose
before
him
when
he
thrust
the
knife
into
the
goose
which
cracked
lorilleux
was
seized
with
an
outburst
of
patriotism
ah
if
it
was
a
cossack
he
cried
have
you
ever
fought
with
cossacks
monsieur
poisson
asked
madame
boche
no
but
i
have
with
bedouins
replied
the
policeman
who
was
cutting
off
a
wing
there
are
no
more
cossacks
a
great
silence
ensued
necks
were
stretched
out
as
every
eye
followed
the
knife
poisson
was
preparing
a
surprise
suddenly
he
gave
a
last
cut
the
of
the
bird
came
off
and
stood
up
on
end
rump
in
the
air
making
a
bishop
mitre
then
admiration
burst
forth
none
were
so
agreeable
in
company
as
retired
soldiers
the
policeman
allowed
several
minutes
for
the
company
to
admire
the
bishop
mitre
and
then
finished
cutting
the
slices
and
arranging
them
on
the
platter
the
carving
of
the
goose
was
now
complete
when
the
ladies
complained
that
they
were
getting
rather
warm
coupeau
opened
the
door
to
the
street
and
the
gaiety
continued
against
the
background
of
cabs
rattling
down
the
street
and
pedestrians
bustling
along
the
pavement
the
goose
was
attacked
furiously
by
the
rested
jaws
boche
remarked
that
just
having
to
wait
and
watch
the
goose
being
carved
had
been
enough
to
make
the
veal
and
pork
slide
down
to
his
ankles
then
ensued
a
famous
that
is
to
say
not
one
of
the
party
recollected
ever
having
before
run
the
risk
of
such
a
gervaise
looking
enormous
her
elbows
on
the
table
ate
great
pieces
of
breast
without
uttering
a
word
for
fear
of
losing
a
mouthful
and
merely
felt
slightly
ashamed
and
annoyed
at
exhibiting
herself
thus
as
gluttonous
as
a
cat
before
goujet
goujet
however
was
too
busy
stuffing
himself
to
notice
that
she
was
all
red
with
eating
besides
in
spite
of
her
greediness
she
remained
so
nice
and
good
she
did
not
speak
but
she
troubled
herself
every
minute
to
look
after
pere
bru
and
place
some
dainty
bit
on
his
plate
it
was
even
touching
to
see
this
glutton
take
a
piece
of
wing
almost
from
her
mouth
to
give
it
to
the
old
fellow
who
did
not
appear
to
be
very
particular
and
who
swallowed
everything
with
bowed
head
almost
besotted
from
having
gobbled
so
much
after
he
had
forgotten
the
taste
of
bread
the
lorilleuxs
expended
their
rage
on
the
roast
goose
they
ate
enough
to
last
them
three
days
they
would
have
stowed
away
the
dish
the
table
the
very
shop
if
they
could
have
ruined
by
doing
so
all
the
ladies
had
wanted
a
piece
of
the
breast
traditionally
the
ladies
portion
madame
lerat
madame
boche
madame
putois
were
all
picking
bones
whilst
mother
coupeau
who
adored
the
neck
was
tearing
off
the
flesh
with
her
two
last
teeth
virginie
liked
the
skin
when
it
was
nicely
browned
and
the
other
guests
gallantly
passed
their
skin
to
her
so
much
so
that
poisson
looked
at
his
wife
severely
and
bade
her
stop
because
she
had
had
enough
as
it
was
once
already
she
had
been
a
fortnight
in
bed
with
her
stomach
swollen
out
through
having
eaten
too
much
roast
goose
but
coupeau
got
angry
and
helped
virginie
to
the
upper
part
of
a
leg
saying
that
by
jove
thunder
if
she
did
not
pick
it
she
was
a
proper
woman
had
roast
goose
ever
done
harm
to
anybody
on
the
contrary
it
cured
all
complaints
of
the
spleen
one
could
eat
it
without
bread
like
dessert
he
could
go
on
swallowing
it
all
night
without
being
the
least
bit
inconvenienced
and
just
to
show
off
he
stuffed
a
whole
into
his
mouth
meanwhile
clemence
had
got
to
the
end
of
the
rump
and
was
sucking
it
with
her
lips
whilst
she
wriggled
with
laughter
on
her
chair
because
boche
was
whispering
all
sorts
of
smutty
things
to
her
ah
by
jove
yes
there
was
a
dinner
when
one
at
it
one
at
it
you
know
and
if
one
only
has
the
chance
now
and
then
one
would
be
precious
stupid
not
to
stuff
oneself
up
to
one
ears
really
one
could
see
their
sides
puff
out
by
degrees
they
were
cracking
in
their
skins
the
blessed
gormandizers
with
their
mouths
open
their
chins
besmeared
with
grease
they
had
such
bloated
red
faces
that
one
would
have
said
they
were
bursting
with
prosperity
as
for
the
wine
well
that
was
flowing
as
freely
around
the
table
as
water
flows
in
the
seine
it
was
like
a
brook
overflowing
after
a
rainstorm
when
the
soil
is
parched
coupeau
raised
the
bottle
high
when
pouring
to
see
the
red
jet
foam
in
the
glass
whenever
he
emptied
a
bottle
he
would
turn
it
upside
down
and
shake
it
one
more
dead
solder
in
a
corner
of
the
laundry
the
pile
of
dead
soldiers
grew
larger
and
larger
a
veritable
cemetery
of
bottles
onto
which
other
debris
from
the
table
was
tossed
coupeau
became
indignant
when
madame
putois
asked
for
water
he
took
all
the
water
pitchers
from
the
table
do
respectable
citizens
ever
drink
water
did
she
want
to
grow
frogs
in
her
stomach
many
glasses
were
emptied
at
one
gulp
you
could
hear
the
liquid
gurgling
its
way
down
the
throats
like
rainwater
in
a
drainpipe
after
a
storm
one
might
say
it
was
raining
wine
dieu
the
juice
of
the
grape
was
a
remarkable
invention
surely
the
workingman
could
get
along
without
his
wine
papa
noah
must
have
planted
his
grapevine
for
the
benefit
of
tailors
and
blacksmiths
it
brightened
you
up
and
refreshed
you
after
a
hard
day
work
coupeau
was
in
a
high
mood
he
proclaimed
that
all
the
ladies
present
were
very
cute
and
jingled
the
three
sous
in
his
pocket
as
if
they
had
been
pieces
even
goujet
who
was
ordinarily
very
sober
had
taken
plenty
of
wine
boche
eyes
were
narrowing
those
of
lorilleux
were
paling
and
poisson
was
developing
expressions
of
stern
severity
on
his
soldierly
face
all
the
men
were
as
drunk
as
lords
and
the
ladies
had
reached
a
certain
point
also
feeling
so
warm
that
they
had
to
loosen
their
clothes
only
clemence
carried
this
a
bit
too
far
suddenly
gervaise
recollected
the
six
sealed
bottles
of
wine
she
had
forgotten
to
put
them
on
the
table
with
the
goose
she
fetched
them
and
all
the
glasses
were
filled
then
poisson
rose
and
holding
his
glass
in
the
air
said
i
drink
to
the
health
of
the
missus
all
of
them
stood
up
making
a
great
noise
with
their
chairs
as
they
moved
holding
out
their
arms
they
clinked
glasses
in
the
midst
of
an
immense
uproar
here
to
this
day
fifty
years
hence
cried
virginie
no
no
replied
gervaise
deeply
moved
and
smiling
i
shall
be
too
old
ah
a
day
comes
when
one
glad
to
go
through
the
door
which
was
wide
open
the
neighborhood
was
looking
on
and
taking
part
in
the
festivities
stopped
in
the
broad
ray
of
light
which
shone
over
the
pavement
and
laughed
heartily
at
seeing
all
these
people
stuffing
away
so
jovially
the
aroma
from
the
roasted
goose
brought
joy
to
the
whole
street
the
clerks
on
the
sidewalk
opposite
thought
they
could
almost
taste
the
bird
others
came
out
frequently
to
stand
in
front
of
their
shops
sniffing
the
air
and
licking
their
lips
the
little
jeweler
was
unable
to
work
dizzy
from
having
counted
so
many
bottles
he
seemed
to
have
lost
his
head
among
his
merry
little
cuckoo
clocks
yes
the
neighbors
were
devoured
with
envy
as
coupeau
said
but
why
should
there
be
any
secret
made
about
the
matter
the
party
now
fairly
launched
was
no
longer
ashamed
of
being
seen
at
table
on
the
contrary
it
felt
flattered
and
excited
at
seeing
the
crowd
gathered
there
gaping
with
gluttony
it
would
have
liked
to
have
knocked
out
the
and
dragged
the
table
into
the
and
there
to
have
enjoyed
the
dessert
under
the
very
nose
of
the
public
and
amidst
the
commotion
of
the
thoroughfare
nothing
disgusting
was
to
be
seen
in
them
was
there
then
there
was
no
need
to
shut
themselves
in
like
selfish
people
coupeau
noticing
the
little
clockmaker
looked
very
thirsty
held
up
a
bottle
and
as
the
other
nodded
his
head
he
carried
him
the
bottle
and
a
glass
a
fraternity
was
established
in
the
street
they
drank
to
anyone
who
passed
they
called
in
any
chaps
who
looked
the
right
sort
the
feast
spread
extending
from
one
to
another
to
the
degree
that
the
entire
neighborhood
of
the
sniffed
the
grub
and
held
its
stomach
amidst
a
rumpus
worthy
of
the
devil
and
all
his
demons
for
some
minutes
madame
vigouroux
the
had
been
passing
to
and
fro
before
the
door
hi
madame
vigouroux
madame
vigouroux
yelled
the
party
she
entered
with
a
broad
grin
on
her
face
which
was
washed
for
once
and
so
fat
that
the
body
of
her
dress
was
bursting
the
men
liked
pinching
her
because
they
might
pinch
her
all
over
without
ever
encountering
a
bone
boche
made
room
for
her
beside
him
and
reached
slyly
under
the
table
to
grab
her
knee
but
she
being
accustomed
to
that
sort
of
thing
quietly
tossed
off
a
glass
of
wine
and
related
that
all
the
neighbors
were
at
their
windows
and
that
some
of
the
people
of
the
house
were
beginning
to
get
angry
oh
that
our
business
said
madame
boche
we
the
concierges
are
we
well
we
answerable
for
good
order
let
them
come
and
complain
to
us
we
receive
them
in
a
way
they
do
expect
in
the
there
had
just
been
a
furious
fight
between
nana
and
augustine
on
account
of
the
dutch
oven
which
both
wanted
to
scrape
out
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
dutch
oven
had
rebounded
over
the
tile
floor
with
the
noise
of
an
old
saucepan
nana
was
now
nursing
little
victor
who
had
a
in
his
throat
she
pushed
her
fingers
under
his
chin
and
made
him
swallow
big
lumps
of
sugar
by
way
of
a
remedy
that
did
not
prevent
her
keeping
an
eye
on
the
big
table
at
every
minute
she
came
and
asked
for
wine
bread
or
meat
for
etienne
and
pauline
she
said
here
burst
her
mother
would
say
to
her
perhaps
you
leave
us
in
peace
now
the
children
were
scarcely
able
to
swallow
any
longer
but
they
continued
to
eat
all
the
same
banging
their
forks
down
on
the
table
to
the
tune
of
a
canticle
in
order
to
excite
themselves
in
the
midst
of
the
noise
however
a
conversation
was
going
on
between
pere
bru
and
mother
coupeau
the
old
fellow
who
was
ghastly
pale
in
spite
of
the
wine
and
the
food
was
talking
of
his
sons
who
had
died
in
the
crimea
ah
if
the
lads
had
only
lived
he
would
have
had
bread
to
eat
every
day
but
mother
coupeau
speaking
thickly
leant
towards
him
and
said
ah
one
has
many
worries
with
children
for
instance
i
appear
to
be
happy
here
do
i
well
i
cry
more
often
than
you
think
no
wish
you
still
had
your
children
pere
bru
shook
his
head
i
ca
get
work
anywhere
murmured
he
i
too
old
when
i
enter
a
workshop
the
young
fellows
joke
and
ask
me
if
i
polished
henri
iv
boots
it
all
over
they
wo
have
me
anywhere
last
year
i
could
still
earn
thirty
sous
a
day
painting
a
bridge
i
had
to
lie
on
my
back
with
the
river
flowing
under
me
i
had
a
bad
cough
ever
since
then
now
i
finished
he
looked
at
his
poor
stiff
hands
and
added
it
easy
to
understand
i
no
longer
good
for
anything
right
were
i
in
their
place
i
should
do
the
same
you
see
the
misfortune
is
that
i
not
dead
yes
it
my
fault
one
should
lie
down
and
croak
when
one
no
longer
able
to
work
really
said
lorilleux
who
was
listening
i
do
understand
why
the
government
does
come
to
the
aid
of
the
invalids
of
labor
i
was
reading
that
in
a
newspaper
the
other
day
but
poisson
thought
it
his
duty
to
defend
the
government
workmen
are
not
soldiers
declared
he
the
invalides
is
for
soldiers
you
must
not
ask
for
what
is
impossible
dessert
was
now
served
in
the
centre
of
the
table
was
a
savoy
cake
in
the
form
of
a
temple
with
a
dome
fluted
with
melon
slices
and
this
dome
was
surmounted
by
an
artificial
rose
close
to
which
was
a
silver
paper
butterfly
fluttering
at
the
end
of
a
wire
two
drops
of
gum
in
the
centre
of
the
flower
imitated
dew
then
to
the
left
a
piece
of
cream
cheese
floated
in
a
deep
dish
whilst
in
another
dish
to
the
right
were
piled
up
some
large
crushed
strawberries
with
the
juice
running
from
them
however
there
was
still
some
salad
left
some
large
coss
lettuce
leaves
soaked
with
oil
come
madame
boche
said
gervaise
coaxingly
a
little
more
salad
i
know
how
fond
you
are
of
it
no
no
thank
you
i
already
had
as
much
as
i
can
manage
replied
the
concierge
the
laundress
turning
towards
virginie
the
latter
put
her
finger
in
her
mouth
as
though
to
touch
the
food
she
had
taken
really
i
full
murmured
she
there
no
room
left
i
swallow
a
mouthful
oh
but
if
you
tried
a
little
resumed
gervaise
with
a
smile
one
can
always
find
a
tiny
corner
empty
once
does
need
to
be
hungry
to
be
able
to
eat
salad
you
surely
not
going
to
let
this
be
wasted
you
can
eat
it
said
madame
lerat
it
nicer
when
its
wilted
the
ladies
sighed
as
they
looked
regretfully
at
the
clemence
related
that
she
had
one
day
eaten
three
bunches
of
watercresses
at
her
lunch
madame
putois
could
do
more
than
that
she
would
take
a
coss
lettuce
and
munch
it
up
with
some
salt
just
as
it
was
without
separating
the
leaves
they
could
all
have
lived
on
salad
would
have
treated
themselves
to
tubfuls
and
this
conversation
aiding
the
ladies
cleaned
out
the
i
could
go
on
all
fours
in
a
meadow
observed
the
concierge
with
her
mouth
full
then
they
chuckled
together
as
they
eyed
the
dessert
dessert
did
not
count
it
came
rather
late
but
that
did
not
matter
they
would
nurse
it
all
the
same
when
you
that
stuffed
you
ca
let
yourself
be
stopped
by
strawberries
and
cake
there
was
no
hurry
they
had
the
entire
night
if
they
wished
so
they
piled
their
plates
with
strawberries
and
cream
cheese
meanwhile
the
men
lit
their
pipes
they
were
drinking
the
ordinary
wine
while
they
smoked
since
the
special
wine
had
been
finished
now
they
insisted
that
gervaise
cut
the
savoy
cake
poisson
got
up
and
took
the
rose
from
the
cake
and
presented
it
in
his
most
gallant
manner
to
the
hostess
amidst
applause
from
the
other
guests
she
pinned
it
over
her
left
breast
near
the
heart
the
silver
butterfly
fluttered
with
her
every
movement
well
look
exclaimed
lorilleux
who
had
just
made
a
discovery
your
that
we
eating
off
ah
well
i
daresay
it
never
seen
so
much
work
before
this
malicious
joke
had
a
great
success
witty
allusions
came
from
all
sides
clemence
could
not
swallow
a
spoonful
of
strawberries
without
saying
that
it
was
another
shirt
ironed
madame
lerat
pretended
that
the
cream
cheese
smelt
of
starch
whilst
madame
lorilleux
said
between
her
teeth
that
it
was
capital
fun
to
gobble
up
the
money
so
quickly
on
the
very
boards
on
which
one
had
had
so
much
trouble
to
earn
it
there
was
quite
a
tempest
of
shouts
and
laughter
but
suddenly
a
loud
voice
called
for
silence
it
was
boche
who
standing
up
in
an
affected
and
vulgar
way
was
commencing
to
sing
the
volcano
of
love
or
the
seductive
trooper
a
thunder
of
applause
greeted
the
first
verse
yes
yes
they
would
sing
songs
everyone
in
turn
it
was
more
amusing
than
anything
else
and
they
all
put
their
elbows
on
the
table
or
leant
back
in
their
chairs
nodding
their
heads
at
the
best
parts
and
sipping
their
wine
when
they
came
to
the
choruses
that
rogue
boche
had
a
special
gift
for
comic
songs
he
would
almost
make
the
water
pitchers
laugh
when
he
imitated
the
raw
recruit
with
his
fingers
apart
and
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
directly
after
the
volcano
of
love
he
burst
out
into
the
baroness
de
follebiche
one
of
his
greatest
successes
when
he
reached
the
third
verse
he
turned
towards
clemence
and
almost
murmured
it
in
a
slow
and
voluptuous
tone
of
voice
the
baroness
had
people
there
her
sisters
four
oh
rare
surprise
and
three
were
dark
and
one
was
fair
between
them
eight
bewitching
eyes
then
the
whole
party
carried
away
joined
in
the
chorus
the
men
beat
time
with
their
heels
whilst
the
ladies
did
the
same
with
their
knives
against
their
glasses
all
of
them
singing
at
the
top
of
their
voices
by
jingo
who
on
earth
will
pay
a
drink
to
the
pa
to

the
panes
of
glass
of
the
resounded
the
singers
great
volume
of
breath
agitated
the
muslin
curtains
whilst
all
this
was
going
on
virginie
had
already
twice
disappeared
and
each
time
on
returning
had
leant
towards
gervaise
ear
to
whisper
a
piece
of
information
when
she
returned
the
third
time
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
she
said
to
her
my
dear
he
still
at
francois
he
pretending
to
read
the
newspaper
he
certainly
meditating
some
evil
design
she
was
speaking
of
lantier
it
was
him
that
she
had
been
watching
at
each
fresh
report
gervaise
became
more
and
more
grave
is
he
drunk
asked
she
of
virginie
no
replied
the
tall
brunette
he
looks
as
though
he
had
merely
had
what
he
required
it
that
especially
which
makes
me
anxious
why
does
he
remain
there
if
he
had
all
he
wanted
dieu
i
hope
nothing
is
going
to
happen
the
laundress
greatly
upset
begged
her
to
leave
off
a
profound
silence
suddenly
succeeded
the
clamor
madame
putois
had
just
risen
and
was
about
to
sing
the
boarding
of
the
pirate
the
guests
silent
and
thoughtful
watched
her
even
poisson
had
laid
his
pipe
down
on
the
edge
of
the
table
the
better
to
listen
to
her
she
stood
up
to
the
full
height
of
her
little
figure
with
a
fierce
expression
about
her
though
her
face
looked
quite
pale
beneath
her
black
cap
she
thrust
out
her
left
fist
with
a
satisfied
pride
as
she
thundered
in
a
voice
bigger
than
herself
if
the
pirate
audacious
should
the
waves
chase
us
the
buccaneer
slaughter
accord
him
no
quarter
to
the
guns
every
man
and
with
rum
fill
each
can
while
these
pests
of
the
seas
dangle
from
the
that
was
something
serious
by
jove
it
gave
one
a
fine
idea
of
the
real
thing
poisson
who
had
been
on
board
ship
nodded
his
head
in
approval
of
the
description
one
could
see
too
that
that
song
was
in
accordance
with
madame
putois
own
feeling
coupeau
then
told
how
madame
putois
one
evening
on
rue
poulet
had
slapped
the
face
of
four
men
who
sought
to
attack
her
virtue
with
the
assistance
of
mother
coupeau
gervaise
was
now
serving
the
coffee
though
some
of
the
guests
had
not
yet
finished
their
savoy
cake
they
would
not
let
her
sit
down
again
but
shouted
that
it
was
her
turn
with
a
pale
face
and
looking
very
ill
at
ease
she
tried
to
excuse
herself
she
seemed
so
queer
that
someone
inquired
whether
the
goose
had
disagreed
with
her
she
finally
gave
them
oh
let
me
slumber
in
a
sweet
and
feeble
voice
when
she
reached
the
chorus
with
its
wish
for
a
sleep
filled
with
beautiful
dreams
her
eyelids
partly
closed
and
her
rapt
gaze
lost
itself
in
the
darkness
of
the
street
poisson
stood
next
and
with
an
abrupt
bow
to
the
ladies
sang
a
drinking
song
the
wines
of
france
but
his
voice
was
very
musical
and
only
the
final
verse
a
patriotic
one
mentioning
the
tricolor
flag
was
a
success
then
he
raised
his
glass
high
juggled
it
a
moment
and
poured
the
contents
into
his
open
mouth
then
came
a
string
of
ballads
madame
boche
barcarolle
was
all
about
venice
and
the
gondoliers
madame
lorilleux
sang
of
seville
and
the
andalusians
in
her
bolero
whilst
lorilleux
went
so
far
as
to
allude
to
the
perfumes
of
arabia
in
reference
to
the
loves
of
fatima
the
dancer
golden
horizons
were
opening
up
all
around
the
heavily
laden
table
the
men
were
smoking
their
pipes
and
the
women
unconsciously
smiling
with
pleasure
all
were
dreaming
they
were
far
away
clemence
began
to
sing
softly
let
make
a
nest
with
a
tremolo
in
her
voice
which
pleased
them
greatly
for
it
made
them
think
of
the
open
country
of
songbirds
of
dancing
beneath
an
arbor
and
of
flowers
in
short
it
made
them
think
of
the
bois
de
vincennes
when
they
went
there
for
a
picnic
but
virginie
revived
the
joking
with
my
little
drop
of
brandy
she
imitated
a
camp
follower
with
one
hand
on
her
hip
the
elbow
arched
to
indicate
the
little
barrel
and
with
the
other
hand
she
poured
out
the
brandy
into
space
by
turning
her
fist
round
she
did
it
so
well
that
the
party
then
begged
mother
coupeau
to
sing
the
mouse
the
old
woman
refused
vowing
that
she
did
not
know
that
naughty
song
yet
she
started
off
with
the
remnants
of
her
broken
voice
and
her
wrinkled
face
with
its
lively
little
eyes
underlined
the
allusions
the
terrors
of
mademoiselle
lise
drawing
her
skirts
around
her
at
the
sight
of
a
mouse
all
the
table
laughed
the
women
could
not
keep
their
countenances
and
continued
casting
bright
glances
at
their
neighbors
it
was
not
indecent
after
all
there
were
no
coarse
words
in
it
all
during
the
song
boche
was
playing
mouse
up
and
down
the
legs
of
the
lady
things
might
have
gotten
a
bit
out
of
line
if
goujet
in
response
to
a
glance
from
gervaise
had
not
brought
back
the
respectful
silence
with
the
farewell
of
which
he
sang
out
loudly
in
his
bass
voice
the
song
rang
out
from
his
golden
beard
as
if
from
a
brass
trumpet
all
the
hearts
skipped
a
beat
when
he
cried
ah
my
noble
comrade
referring
to
the
warrior
black
mare
they
burst
into
applause
even
before
the
end
now
pere
bru
it
your
turn
said
mother
coupeau
sing
your
song
the
old
ones
are
the
best
any
day
and
everybody
turned
towards
the
old
man
pressing
him
and
encouraging
him
he
in
a
state
of
torpor
with
his
immovable
mask
of
tanned
skin
looked
at
them
without
appearing
to
understand
they
asked
him
if
he
knew
the
five
vowels
he
held
down
his
head
he
could
not
recollect
it
all
the
songs
of
the
good
old
days
were
mixed
up
in
his
head
as
they
made
up
their
minds
to
leave
him
alone
he
seemed
to
remember
and
began
to
stutter
in
a
cavernous
voice
trou
la
la
trou
la
la
trou
la
trou
la
trou
la
la
his
face
assumed
an
animated
expression
this
chorus
seemed
to
awake
some
gaieties
within
him
enjoyed
by
himself
alone
as
he
listened
with
a
childish
delight
to
his
voice
which
became
more
and
more
hollow
say
there
my
dear
virginie
came
and
whispered
in
gervaise
ear
i
just
been
there
again
you
know
it
worried
me
well
lantier
has
disappeared
from
francois
you
did
meet
him
outside
asked
the
laundress
no
i
walked
quickly
not
as
if
i
was
looking
for
him
but
virginie
raised
her
eyes
interrupted
herself
and
heaved
a
smothered
sigh
ah
dieu
he
there
on
the
pavement
opposite
he
looking
this
way
gervaise
quite
beside
herself
ventured
to
glance
in
the
direction
indicated
some
persons
had
collected
in
the
street
to
hear
the
party
sing
and
lantier
was
indeed
there
in
the
front
row
listening
and
coolly
looking
on
it
was
rare
cheek
everything
considered
gervaise
felt
a
chill
ascend
from
her
legs
to
her
heart
and
she
no
longer
dared
to
move
whilst
old
bru
continued
trou
la
la
trou
la
la
trou
la
trou
la
trou
la
la
very
good
thank
you
my
ancient
one
that
enough
said
coupeau
do
you
know
the
whole
of
it
you
shall
sing
it
for
us
another
day
when
we
need
something
sad
this
raised
a
few
laughs
the
old
fellow
stopped
short
glanced
round
the
table
with
his
pale
eyes
and
resumed
his
look
of
a
meditative
animal
coupeau
called
for
more
wine
as
the
coffee
was
finished
clemence
was
eating
strawberries
again
with
the
pause
in
singing
they
began
to
talk
about
a
woman
who
had
been
found
hanging
that
morning
in
the
building
next
door
it
was
madame
lerat
turn
but
she
required
to
prepare
herself
she
dipped
the
corner
of
her
napkin
into
a
glass
of
water
and
applied
it
to
her
temples
because
she
was
too
hot
then
she
asked
for
a
thimbleful
of
brandy
drank
it
and
slowly
wiped
her
lips
the
of
god
shall
it
be
she
murmured
the
of
god
and
tall
and
with
her
bony
nose
and
her
shoulders
as
square
as
a
grenadier
she
began
the
lost
child
left
by
its
mother
alone
is
sure
of
a
home
in
heaven
above
god
sees
and
protects
it
on
earth
from
his
throne
the
child
that
is
lost
is
the
child
of
god
love
her
voice
trembled
at
certain
words
and
dwelt
on
them
in
liquid
notes
she
looked
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eyes
to
heaven
whilst
her
right
hand
swung
before
her
chest
or
pressed
against
her
heart
with
an
impressive
gesture
then
gervaise
tortured
by
lantier
presence
could
not
restrain
her
tears
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
song
was
relating
her
own
suffering
that
she
was
the
lost
child
abandoned
by
its
mother
and
whom
god
was
going
to
take
under
his
protection
clemence
was
now
very
drunk
and
she
burst
into
loud
sobbing
and
placed
her
head
down
onto
the
table
in
an
effort
to
smother
her
gasps
there
was
a
hush
vibrant
with
emotion
the
ladies
had
pulled
out
their
handkerchiefs
and
were
drying
their
eyes
with
their
heads
erect
from
pride
the
men
had
bowed
their
heads
and
were
staring
straight
before
them
blinking
back
their
tears
poisson
bit
off
the
end
of
his
pipe
twice
while
gulping
and
gasping
boche
with
two
large
tears
trickling
down
his
face
was
even
bothering
to
squeeze
the
knee
any
longer
all
these
drunk
revelers
were
as
as
lambs
was
the
wine
almost
coming
out
of
their
eyes
when
the
refrain
began
again
they
all
let
themselves
go
blubbering
into
their
plates
but
gervaise
and
virginie
could
not
in
spite
of
themselves
take
their
eyes
off
the
pavement
opposite
madame
boche
in
her
turn
caught
sight
of
lantier
and
uttered
a
faint
cry
without
ceasing
to
besmear
her
face
with
her
tears
then
all
three
had
very
anxious
faces
as
they
exchanged
involuntary
signs
dieu
if
coupeau
were
to
turn
round
if
coupeau
caught
sight
of
the
other
what
a
butchery
what
carnage
and
they
went
on
to
such
an
extent
that
the
asked
them
whatever
are
you
looking
at
he
leant
forward
and
recognized
lantier
damnation
it
too
much
muttered
he
ah
the
dirty
scoundrel
ah
the
dirty
scoundrel
no
it
too
much
it
must
come
to
an
end
and
as
he
rose
from
his
seat
muttering
most
atrocious
threats
gervaise
in
a
low
voice
implored
him
to
keep
quiet
listen
to
me
i
implore
you
leave
the
knife
alone
remain
where
you
are
do
do
anything
dreadful
virginie
had
to
take
the
knife
which
he
had
picked
up
off
the
table
from
him
but
she
could
not
prevent
him
leaving
the
shop
and
going
up
to
lantier
those
around
the
table
saw
nothing
of
this
so
involved
were
they
in
weeping
over
the
song
as
madame
lerat
sang
the
last
verse
it
sounded
like
a
moaning
wail
of
the
wind
and
madame
putois
was
so
moved
that
she
spilled
her
wine
over
the
table
gervaise
remained
frozen
with
fright
one
hand
tight
against
her
lips
to
stifle
her
sobs
she
expected
at
any
moment
to
see
one
of
the
two
men
fall
unconscious
in
the
street
as
coupeau
rushed
toward
lantier
he
was
so
astonished
by
the
fresh
air
that
he
staggered
and
lantier
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
merely
took
a
step
to
the
side
now
the
two
men
were
almost
shouting
at
each
other
coupeau
calling
the
other
a
lousy
pig
and
threatening
to
make
sausage
of
his
guts
they
were
shouting
loudly
and
angrily
and
waving
their
arms
violently
gervaise
felt
faint
and
as
it
continued
for
a
while
she
closed
her
eyes
suddenly
she
did
hear
any
shouting
and
opened
her
eyes
the
two
men
were
chatting
amiably
together
madame
lerat
voice
rose
higher
and
higher
warbling
another
verse
gervaise
exchanged
a
glance
with
madame
boche
and
virginie
was
it
going
to
end
amicably
then
coupeau
and
lantier
continued
to
converse
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
they
were
still
abusing
each
other
but
in
a
friendly
way
as
people
were
staring
at
them
they
ended
by
strolling
leisurely
side
by
side
past
the
houses
turning
round
again
every
ten
yards
or
so
a
very
animated
conversation
was
now
taking
place
suddenly
coupeau
appeared
to
become
angry
again
whilst
the
other
was
refusing
something
and
required
to
be
pressed
and
it
was
the
who
pushed
lantier
along
and
who
forced
him
to
cross
the
street
and
enter
the
shop
i
tell
you
you
quite
welcome
shouted
he
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
men
are
men
you
know
we
ought
to
understand
each
other
madame
lerat
was
finishing
the
last
chorus
the
ladies
were
singing
all
together
as
they
twisted
their
handkerchiefs
the
child
that
is
lost
is
the
child
of
god
love
the
singer
was
greatly
complimented
and
she
resumed
her
seat
affecting
to
be
quite
broken
down
she
asked
for
something
to
drink
because
she
always
put
too
much
feeling
into
that
song
and
she
was
constantly
afraid
of
straining
her
vocal
chords
everyone
at
the
table
now
had
their
eyes
fixed
on
lantier
who
quietly
seated
beside
coupeau
was
devouring
the
last
piece
of
savoy
cake
which
he
dipped
in
his
glass
of
wine
with
the
exception
of
virginie
and
madame
boche
none
of
the
guests
knew
him
the
lorilleuxs
certainly
scented
some
underhand
business
but
not
knowing
what
they
merely
assumed
their
most
conceited
air
goujet
who
had
noticed
gervaise
emotion
gave
the
newcomer
a
sour
look
as
an
awkward
pause
ensued
coupeau
simply
said
a
friend
of
mine
and
turning
to
his
wife
added
come
stir
yourself
perhaps
there
still
some
hot
coffee
left
gervaise
feeling
meek
and
stupid
looked
at
them
one
after
the
other
at
first
when
her
husband
pushed
her
old
lover
into
the
shop
she
buried
her
head
between
her
hands
the
same
as
she
instinctively
did
on
stormy
days
at
each
clap
of
thunder
she
could
not
believe
it
possible
the
walls
would
fall
in
and
crush
them
all
then
when
she
saw
the
two
sitting
together
peacefully
she
suddenly
accepted
it
as
quite
natural
a
happy
feeling
of
languor
benumbed
her
retained
her
all
in
a
heap
at
the
edge
of
the
table
with
the
sole
desire
of
not
being
bothered
dieu
what
is
the
use
of
putting
oneself
out
when
others
do
not
and
when
things
arrange
themselves
to
the
satisfaction
of
everybody
she
got
up
to
see
if
there
was
any
coffee
left
in
the
the
children
had
fallen
asleep
that
augustine
had
tyrannized
over
them
all
during
the
dessert
pilfering
their
strawberries
and
frightening
them
with
the
most
abominable
threats
now
she
felt
very
ill
and
was
bent
double
upon
a
stool
not
uttering
a
word
her
face
ghastly
pale
fat
pauline
had
let
her
head
fall
against
etienne
shoulder
and
he
himself
was
sleeping
on
the
edge
of
the
table
nana
was
seated
with
victor
on
the
rug
beside
the
bedstead
she
had
passed
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
was
drawing
him
towards
her
and
succumbing
to
drowsiness
and
with
her
eyes
shut
she
kept
repeating
in
a
feeble
voice
oh
mamma
i
not
well
oh
mamma
i
not
well
no
wonder
murmured
augustine
whose
head
was
rolling
about
on
her
shoulders
they
drunk
they
been
singing
like
grown
up
persons
gervaise
received
another
blow
on
beholding
etienne
she
felt
as
though
she
would
choke
when
she
thought
of
the
youngster
father
being
there
in
the
other
room
eating
cake
and
that
he
had
not
even
expressed
a
desire
to
kiss
the
little
fellow
she
was
on
the
point
of
rousing
etienne
and
of
carrying
him
there
in
her
arms
then
she
again
felt
that
the
quiet
way
in
which
matters
had
been
arranged
was
the
best
it
would
not
have
been
proper
to
have
disturbed
the
harmony
of
the
end
of
the
dinner
she
returned
with
the
and
poured
out
a
glass
of
coffee
for
lantier
who
by
the
way
did
not
appear
to
take
any
notice
of
her
now
it
my
turn
stuttered
coupeau
in
a
thick
voice
been
keeping
the
best
for
the
last
well
i
sing
you
piggish
child
yes
yes
piggish
child
cried
everyone
the
uproar
was
beginning
again
lantier
was
forgotten
the
ladies
prepared
their
glasses
and
their
knives
for
accompanying
the
chorus
they
laughed
beforehand
as
they
looked
at
the
who
steadied
himself
on
his
legs
as
he
put
on
his
most
vulgar
air
mimicking
the
hoarse
voice
of
an
old
woman
he
sang
when
out
of
bed
each
morn
i
hop
i
always
precious
queer
i
send
him
for
a
little
drop
to
the
that
near
a
good
half
hour
or
more
he
stay
and
that
makes
me
so
riled
he
swigs
it
half
upon
his
way
what
a
piggish
child
and
the
ladies
striking
their
glasses
repeated
in
chorus
in
the
midst
of
a
formidable
gaiety
what
a
piggish
child
what
a
piggish
child
even
the
rue
de
la
itself
joined
in
now
the
whole
neighborhood
was
singing
what
a
piggish
child
the
little
clockmaker
the
grocery
clerks
the
tripe
woman
and
the
fruit
woman
all
knew
the
song
and
joined
in
the
chorus
the
entire
street
seemed
to
be
getting
drunk
on
the
odors
from
the
coupeau
party
in
the
reddish
haze
from
the
two
lamps
the
noise
of
the
party
was
enough
to
shut
out
the
rumbling
of
the
last
vehicles
in
the
street
two
policemen
rushed
over
thinking
there
was
a
riot
but
on
recognizing
poisson
they
saluted
him
smartly
and
went
away
between
the
darkened
buildings
coupeau
was
now
singing
this
verse
on
sundays
at
petite
villette
the
weather
fine
we
call
on
uncle
old
tinette
who
in
the
dustman
line
to
feast
upon
some
cherry
stones
the
young
un
almost
wild
and
rolls
amongst
the
dust
and
bones
what
a
piggish
child
what
a
piggish
child
then
the
house
almost
collapsed
such
a
yell
ascended
in
the
calm
warm
night
air
that
the
shouters
applauded
themselves
for
it
was
useless
their
hoping
to
be
able
to
bawl
any
louder
not
one
of
the
party
could
ever
recollect
exactly
how
the
carouse
terminated
it
must
have
been
very
late
it
quite
certain
for
not
a
cat
was
to
be
seen
in
the
street
possibly
too
they
had
all
joined
hands
and
danced
round
the
table
but
all
was
submerged
in
a
yellow
mist
in
which
red
faces
were
jumping
about
with
mouths
slit
from
ear
to
ear
they
had
probably
treated
themselves
to
something
stronger
than
wine
towards
the
end
and
there
was
a
vague
suspicion
that
some
one
had
played
them
the
trick
of
putting
salt
into
the
glasses
the
children
must
have
undressed
and
put
themselves
to
bed
on
the
morrow
madame
boche
boasted
of
having
treated
boche
to
a
couple
of
clouts
in
a
corner
where
he
was
conversing
a
great
deal
too
close
to
the
but
boche
who
recollected
nothing
said
she
must
have
dreamt
it
everyone
agreed
that
it
was
very
decent
the
way
clemence
had
carried
on
she
had
ended
by
showing
everything
she
had
and
then
been
so
sick
that
she
had
completely
ruined
one
of
the
muslin
curtains
the
men
had
at
least
the
decency
to
go
into
the
street
lorilleux
and
poisson
feeling
their
stomachs
upset
had
stumblingly
glided
as
far
as
the
shop
it
is
easy
to
see
when
a
person
has
been
well
brought
up
for
instance
the
ladies
madame
putois
madame
lerat
and
virginie
indisposed
by
the
heat
had
simply
gone
into
the
and
taken
their
stays
off
virginie
had
even
desired
to
lie
on
the
bed
for
a
minute
just
to
obviate
any
unpleasant
effects
thus
the
party
had
seemed
to
melt
away
some
disappearing
behind
the
others
all
accompanying
one
another
and
being
lost
sight
of
in
the
surrounding
darkness
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
final
uproar
a
furious
quarrel
between
the
lorilleuxs
and
an
obstinate
and
mournful
trou
la
la
trou
la
la
of
old
bru
gervaise
had
an
idea
that
goujet
had
burst
out
sobbing
when
bidding
her
coupeau
was
still
singing
and
as
for
lantier
he
must
have
remained
till
the
end
at
one
moment
even
she
could
still
feel
a
breath
against
her
hair
but
she
was
unable
to
say
whether
it
came
from
lantier
or
if
it
was
the
warm
night
air
since
madame
lerat
did
want
to
return
to
les
batignolles
at
such
a
late
hour
they
took
one
of
the
mattresses
off
the
bed
and
spread
it
for
her
in
a
corner
of
the
shop
after
pushing
back
the
table
she
slept
right
there
amid
all
the
dinner
crumbs
all
night
long
while
the
coupeaus
were
sleeping
a
neighbor
cat
took
advantage
of
an
open
window
and
was
crunching
the
bones
of
the
goose
with
its
sharp
teeth
giving
the
bird
its
final
resting
place
chapter
viii
on
the
following
saturday
coupeau
who
had
not
come
home
to
dinner
brought
lantier
with
him
towards
ten
they
had
had
some
trotters
at
chez
thomas
at
montmartre
you
must
scold
wife
said
the
we
sober
as
you
can
see
oh
there
no
fear
with
him
he
keeps
one
on
the
straight
road
and
he
related
how
they
happened
to
meet
in
the
rue
rochechouart
after
dinner
lantier
had
declined
to
have
a
drink
at
the
black
ball
saying
that
when
one
was
married
to
a
pretty
and
worthy
little
woman
one
ought
not
to
go
at
all
the
wineshops
gervaise
smiled
slightly
as
she
listened
oh
she
was
not
thinking
of
scolding
she
felt
too
much
embarrassed
for
that
she
had
been
expecting
to
see
her
former
lover
again
some
day
ever
since
their
dinner
party
but
at
such
an
hour
when
she
was
about
to
go
to
bed
the
unexpected
arrival
of
the
two
men
had
startled
her
her
hands
were
quivering
as
she
pinned
back
the
hair
which
had
slid
down
her
neck
you
know
resumed
coupeau
as
he
was
so
polite
as
to
decline
a
drink
outside
you
must
treat
us
to
one
here
ah
you
certainly
owe
us
that
the
workwomen
had
left
long
ago
mother
coupeau
and
nana
had
just
gone
to
bed
gervaise
who
had
been
just
about
to
put
up
the
shutters
when
they
appeared
left
the
shop
open
and
brought
some
glasses
which
she
placed
on
a
corner
of
the
with
what
was
left
of
a
bottle
of
brandy
lantier
remained
standing
and
avoided
speaking
directly
to
her
however
when
she
served
him
he
exclaimed
only
a
thimbleful
madame
if
you
please
coupeau
looked
at
them
and
then
spoke
his
mind
very
plainly
they
were
not
going
to
behave
like
a
couple
of
geese
he
hoped
the
past
was
past
was
it
not
if
people
nursed
grudges
for
nine
and
ten
years
together
one
would
end
by
no
longer
seeing
anybody
no
no
he
carried
his
heart
in
his
hand
he
did
first
of
all
he
knew
who
he
had
to
deal
with
a
worthy
woman
and
a
worthy
man
in
short
two
friends
he
felt
easy
he
knew
he
could
depend
upon
them
oh
that
certain
quite
certain
repeated
gervaise
looking
on
the
ground
and
scarcely
understanding
what
she
said
she
is
a
sister
now
nothing
but
a
sister
murmured
lantier
in
his
turn
dieu
shake
hands
cried
coupeau
and
let
those
who
do
like
it
go
to
blazes
when
one
has
proper
feelings
one
is
better
off
than
millionaires
for
myself
i
prefer
friendship
before
everything
because
friendship
is
friendship
and
there
nothing
to
beat
it
he
dealt
himself
heavy
blows
on
the
chest
and
seemed
so
moved
that
they
had
to
calm
him
they
all
three
silently
clinked
glasses
and
drank
their
drop
of
brandy
gervaise
was
then
able
to
look
at
lantier
at
her
ease
for
on
the
night
of
her
saint
day
she
had
only
seen
him
through
a
fog
he
had
grown
more
stout
his
arms
and
legs
seeming
too
heavy
because
of
his
small
stature
his
face
was
still
handsome
even
though
it
was
a
little
puffy
now
due
to
his
life
of
idleness
he
still
took
great
pains
with
his
narrow
moustache
he
looked
about
his
actual
age
he
was
wearing
grey
trousers
a
heavy
blue
overcoat
and
a
round
hat
he
even
had
a
watch
with
a
silver
chain
on
which
a
ring
was
hanging
as
a
keepsake
he
looked
quite
like
a
gentleman
i
off
said
he
i
live
no
end
of
a
distance
from
here
he
was
already
on
the
pavement
when
the
called
him
back
to
make
him
promise
never
to
pass
the
door
without
looking
in
to
wish
them
good
day
meanwhile
gervaise
who
had
quietly
disappeared
returned
pushing
etienne
before
her
the
child
who
was
in
his
and
half
asleep
smiled
as
he
rubbed
his
eyes
but
when
he
beheld
lantier
he
stood
trembling
and
embarrassed
and
casting
anxious
glances
in
the
direction
of
his
mother
and
coupeau
do
you
remember
this
gentleman
asked
the
latter
the
child
held
down
his
head
without
replying
then
he
made
a
slight
sign
which
meant
that
he
did
remember
the
gentleman
well
then
do
stand
there
like
a
fool
go
and
kiss
him
lantier
gravely
and
quietly
waited
when
etienne
had
made
up
his
mind
to
approach
him
he
stooped
down
presented
both
his
cheeks
and
then
kissed
the
youngster
on
the
forehead
himself
at
this
the
boy
ventured
to
look
at
his
father
but
all
on
a
sudden
he
burst
out
sobbing
and
scampered
away
like
a
mad
creature
with
his
clothes
half
falling
off
him
whilst
coupeau
angrily
called
him
a
young
savage
the
emotion
too
much
for
him
said
gervaise
pale
and
agitated
herself
oh
he
generally
very
gentle
and
nice
exclaimed
coupeau
brought
him
up
properly
as
you
see
he
get
used
to
you
he
must
learn
to
know
people
we
ca
stay
mad
we
should
have
made
up
a
long
time
ago
for
his
sake
i
rather
have
my
head
cut
off
than
keep
a
father
from
seeing
his
own
son
having
thus
delivered
himself
he
talked
of
finishing
the
bottle
of
brandy
all
three
clinked
glasses
again
lantier
showed
no
surprise
but
remained
perfectly
calm
by
way
of
repaying
the
politeness
he
persisted
in
helping
him
put
up
the
shutters
before
taking
his
departure
then
rubbing
his
hands
together
to
get
rid
of
the
dust
on
them
he
wished
the
couple
sleep
well
i
shall
try
and
catch
the
last
bus
i
promise
you
i
look
in
again
soon
after
that
evening
lantier
frequently
called
at
the
rue
de
la
he
came
when
the
was
there
inquiring
after
his
health
the
moment
he
passed
the
door
and
affecting
to
have
solely
called
on
his
account
then
his
hair
nicely
combed
and
always
wearing
his
overcoat
he
would
take
a
seat
by
the
window
and
converse
politely
with
the
manners
of
an
educated
man
it
was
thus
that
the
coupeaus
learnt
little
by
little
the
details
of
his
life
during
the
last
eight
years
he
had
for
a
while
managed
a
hat
factory
and
when
they
asked
him
why
he
had
retired
from
it
he
merely
alluded
to
the
rascality
of
a
partner
a
fellow
from
his
native
place
a
scoundrel
who
had
squandered
all
the
takings
with
women
his
former
position
as
an
employer
continued
to
affect
his
entire
personality
like
a
title
of
nobility
that
he
could
not
abandon
he
was
always
talking
of
concluding
a
magnificent
deal
with
some
hatmakers
who
were
going
to
set
him
up
in
business
while
waiting
for
this
he
did
nothing
but
stroll
around
all
day
like
one
of
the
idle
rich
if
anyone
dared
to
mention
a
hat
factory
looking
for
workers
he
smiled
and
said
he
was
not
interested
in
breaking
his
back
working
for
others
a
smart
fellow
like
lantier
according
to
coupeau
knew
how
to
take
care
of
himself
he
always
looked
prosperous
and
it
took
money
to
look
thus
he
must
have
some
deal
going
one
morning
coupeau
had
seen
him
having
his
shoes
shined
on
the
boulevard
montmartre
lantier
was
very
talkative
about
others
but
the
truth
was
that
he
told
lies
about
himself
he
would
not
even
say
where
he
lived
only
that
he
was
staying
with
a
friend
and
there
was
no
use
in
coming
to
see
him
because
he
was
never
in
it
was
now
early
november
lantier
would
gallantly
bring
bunches
of
violets
for
gervaise
and
the
workwomen
he
was
now
coming
almost
every
day
he
won
the
favor
of
clemence
and
madame
putois
with
his
little
attentions
at
the
end
of
the
month
they
adored
him
the
boches
whom
he
flattered
by
going
to
pay
his
respects
in
their
concierge
lodge
went
into
ecstasies
over
his
politeness
as
soon
as
the
lorilleuxs
knew
who
he
was
they
howled
at
the
impudence
of
gervaise
in
bringing
her
former
lover
into
her
home
however
one
day
lantier
went
to
visit
them
and
made
such
a
good
impression
when
he
ordered
a
necklace
for
a
lady
of
his
acquaintance
that
they
invited
him
to
sit
down
he
stayed
an
hour
and
they
were
so
charmed
by
his
conversation
that
they
wondered
how
a
man
of
such
distinction
had
ever
lived
with
soon
lantier
visits
to
the
coupeaus
were
accepted
as
perfectly
natural
he
was
in
the
good
graces
of
everyone
along
the
rue
de
la
goujet
was
the
only
one
who
remained
cold
if
he
happened
to
be
there
when
lantier
arrived
he
would
leave
at
once
as
he
did
want
to
be
obliged
to
be
friendly
to
him
in
the
midst
however
of
all
this
extraordinary
affection
for
lantier
gervaise
lived
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
for
the
first
few
weeks
she
felt
that
burning
sensation
in
the
pit
of
her
stomach
which
affected
her
on
the
day
when
virginie
first
alluded
to
her
past
life
her
great
fear
was
that
she
might
find
herself
without
strength
if
he
came
upon
her
all
alone
one
night
and
took
it
into
his
head
to
kiss
her
she
thought
of
him
too
much
she
was
for
ever
thinking
of
him
but
she
gradually
became
calmer
on
seeing
him
behave
so
well
never
looking
her
in
the
face
never
even
touching
her
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
when
no
one
was
watching
then
virginie
who
seemed
to
read
within
her
made
her
ashamed
of
all
her
wicked
thoughts
why
did
she
tremble
once
could
not
hope
to
come
across
a
nicer
man
she
certainly
had
nothing
to
fear
now
and
one
day
the
tall
brunette
maneuvered
in
such
a
way
as
to
get
them
both
into
a
corner
and
to
turn
the
conversation
to
the
subject
of
love
lantier
choosing
his
words
declared
in
a
grave
voice
that
his
heart
was
dead
that
for
the
future
he
wished
to
consecrate
his
life
solely
for
his
son
happiness
every
evening
he
would
kiss
etienne
on
the
forehead
yet
he
was
apt
to
forget
him
in
teasing
back
and
forth
with
clemence
and
he
never
mentioned
claude
who
was
still
in
the
south
gervaise
began
to
feel
at
ease
lantier
actual
presence
overshadowed
her
memories
and
seeing
him
all
the
time
she
no
longer
dreamed
about
him
she
even
felt
a
certain
repugnance
at
the
thought
of
their
former
relationship
yes
it
was
over
if
he
dared
to
approach
her
box
his
ears
or
even
better
she
tell
her
husband
once
again
her
thoughts
turned
to
goujet
and
his
affection
for
her
one
morning
clemence
reported
that
the
previous
night
at
about
eleven
she
had
seen
monsieur
lantier
with
a
woman
she
told
about
it
maliciously
and
in
coarse
terms
to
see
how
gervaise
would
react
yes
monsieur
lantier
was
on
the
rue
notre
dame
de
lorette
with
a
blonde
and
she
followed
them
they
had
gone
into
a
shop
where
the
and
woman
had
bought
some
shrimps
then
they
went
to
the
rue
de
la
rochefoucauld
monsieur
lantier
had
waited
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
house
while
his
lady
friend
went
in
alone
then
she
had
beckoned
to
him
from
the
window
to
join
her
no
matter
how
clemence
went
on
with
the
story
gervaise
went
on
peacefully
ironing
a
white
dress
sometimes
she
smiled
faintly
these
southerners
she
said
are
all
crazy
about
women
they
have
to
have
them
no
matter
what
even
if
they
come
from
a
dung
heap
when
lantier
came
in
that
evening
gervaise
was
amused
when
clemence
teased
him
about
the
blonde
he
seemed
to
feel
flattered
that
he
had
been
seen
dieu
she
was
just
an
old
friend
he
explained
he
saw
her
from
time
to
time
she
was
quite
stylish
he
mentioned
some
of
her
former
lovers
among
them
a
count
an
important
merchant
and
the
son
of
a
lawyer
he
added
that
a
bit
of
playing
around
did
mean
a
thing
his
heart
was
dead
in
the
end
clemence
had
to
pay
a
price
for
her
meanness
she
certainly
felt
lantier
pinching
her
hard
two
or
three
times
without
seeming
to
do
so
she
was
also
jealous
because
she
did
reek
of
musk
like
that
boulevard
when
spring
came
lantier
who
was
now
quite
one
of
the
family
talked
of
living
in
the
neighborhood
so
as
to
be
nearer
his
friends
he
wanted
a
furnished
room
in
a
decent
house
madame
boche
and
even
gervaise
herself
went
searching
about
to
find
it
for
him
they
explored
the
neighboring
streets
but
he
was
always
too
difficult
to
please
he
required
a
big
courtyard
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
in
fact
every
luxury
imaginable
and
then
every
evening
at
the
coupeaus
he
seemed
to
measure
the
height
of
the
ceilings
study
the
arrangement
of
the
rooms
and
covet
a
similar
lodging
oh
he
would
never
have
asked
for
anything
better
he
would
willingly
have
made
himself
a
hole
in
that
warm
quiet
corner
then
each
time
he
wound
up
his
inspection
with
these
words
by
jove
you
are
comfortably
situated
here
one
evening
when
he
had
dined
there
and
was
making
the
same
remark
during
the
dessert
coupeau
who
now
treated
him
most
familiarly
suddenly
exclaimed
you
must
stay
here
old
boy
if
it
suits
you
it
easily
arranged
and
he
explained
that
the
room
cleaned
out
would
make
a
nice
apartment
etienne
could
sleep
in
the
shop
on
a
mattress
on
the
floor
that
was
all
no
no
said
lantier
i
can
not
accept
it
would
inconvenience
you
too
much
i
know
that
it
willingly
offered
but
we
should
be
too
warm
all
jumbled
up
together
besides
you
know
each
one
likes
his
liberty
i
should
have
to
go
through
your
room
and
that
would
be
exactly
funny
ah
the
rogue
resumed
the
choking
with
laughter
banging
his
fist
down
on
the
table
he
always
thinking
of
something
smutty
but
you
joker
we
of
an
inventive
turn
of
mind
there
two
windows
in
the
room
are
there
well
we
knock
one
out
and
turn
it
into
a
door
then
you
understand
you
come
in
by
way
of
the
courtyard
and
we
can
even
stop
up
the
other
door
if
we
like
thus
you
be
in
your
home
and
we
in
ours
a
pause
ensued
at
length
the
hatter
murmured
ah
yes
in
that
manner
perhaps
we
might
and
yet
no
i
should
be
too
much
in
your
way
he
avoided
looking
at
gervaise
but
he
was
evidently
waiting
for
a
word
from
her
before
accepting
she
was
very
much
annoyed
at
her
idea
not
that
the
thought
of
seeing
lantier
living
with
them
wounded
her
feelings
or
made
her
particularly
uneasy
but
she
was
wondering
where
she
would
be
able
to
keep
the
dirty
clothes
coupeau
was
going
on
about
the
advantages
of
the
arrangement
their
rent
five
hundred
francs
had
always
been
a
bit
steep
their
friend
could
pay
twenty
francs
a
month
for
a
nicely
furnished
room
and
it
would
help
them
with
the
rent
he
would
be
responsible
for
fixing
up
a
big
box
under
their
bed
that
would
be
large
enough
to
hold
all
the
dirty
clothes
gervaise
still
hesitated
she
looked
toward
mother
coupeau
for
guidance
lantier
had
won
over
mother
coupeau
months
ago
by
bringing
her
gum
drops
for
her
cough
you
would
certainly
not
be
in
our
way
gervaise
ended
by
saying
we
could
so
arrange
things
no
no
thanks
repeated
the
hatter
you
too
kind
it
would
be
asking
too
much
coupeau
could
no
longer
restrain
himself
was
he
going
to
continue
making
objections
when
they
told
him
it
was
freely
offered
he
would
be
obliging
them
there
did
he
understand
then
in
an
excited
tone
of
voice
he
yelled
etienne
etienne
the
youngster
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
table
he
raised
his
head
with
a
start
listen
tell
him
that
you
wish
it
yes
that
gentleman
there
tell
him
as
loud
as
you
can
wish
it
i
wish
it
stuttered
etienne
his
voice
thick
with
sleep
everyone
laughed
but
lantier
resumed
his
grave
and
impressive
air
he
squeezed
coupeau
hand
across
the
table
as
he
said
i
accept
it
in
all
good
fellowship
on
both
sides
is
it
not
yes
i
accept
for
the
child
sake
the
next
day
when
the
landlord
monsieur
marescot
came
to
spend
an
hour
with
the
boches
gervaise
mentioned
the
matter
to
him
he
refused
angrily
at
first
then
after
a
careful
inspection
of
the
premises
particularly
gazing
upward
to
verify
that
the
upper
floors
would
not
be
weakened
he
finally
granted
permission
on
condition
there
would
be
no
expense
to
him
he
had
the
coupeaus
sign
a
paper
saying
they
would
restore
everything
to
its
original
state
on
the
expiration
of
the
lease
coupeau
brought
in
some
friends
of
his
that
very
evening
a
mason
a
carpenter
and
a
painter
they
would
do
this
job
in
the
evenings
as
a
favor
to
him
still
installing
the
door
and
cleaning
up
the
room
cost
over
one
hundred
francs
not
counting
the
wine
that
kept
the
work
going
coupeau
told
his
friends
he
pay
them
something
later
out
of
the
rent
from
his
tenant
then
the
furniture
for
the
room
had
to
be
sorted
out
gervaise
left
mother
coupeau
wardrobe
where
it
was
and
added
a
table
and
two
chairs
taken
from
her
own
room
she
had
to
buy
a
and
a
bed
with
mattress
and
bedclothes
costing
one
hundred
and
thirty
francs
which
she
was
to
pay
off
at
ten
francs
a
month
although
lantier
twenty
francs
would
be
used
to
pay
off
these
debts
for
ten
months
there
would
be
a
nice
little
profit
later
it
was
during
the
early
days
of
june
that
the
hatter
moved
in
the
day
before
coupeau
had
offered
to
go
with
him
and
fetch
his
box
to
save
him
the
thirty
sous
for
a
cab
but
the
other
became
quite
embarrassed
saying
that
the
box
was
too
heavy
as
though
he
wished
up
to
the
last
moment
to
hide
the
place
where
he
lodged
he
arrived
in
the
afternoon
towards
three
coupeau
did
not
happen
to
be
in
and
gervaise
standing
at
the
shop
door
became
quite
pale
on
recognizing
the
box
outside
the
cab
it
was
their
old
box
the
one
with
which
they
had
journeyed
from
plassans
all
scratched
and
broken
now
and
held
together
by
cords
she
saw
it
return
as
she
had
often
dreamt
it
would
and
it
needed
no
great
stretch
of
imagination
to
believe
that
the
same
cab
that
cab
in
which
that
strumpet
of
a
burnisher
had
played
her
such
a
foul
trick
had
brought
the
box
back
again
meanwhile
boche
was
giving
lantier
a
helping
hand
the
laundress
followed
them
in
silence
and
feeling
rather
dazed
when
they
had
deposited
their
burden
in
the
middle
of
the
room
she
said
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
well
that
a
good
thing
finished
is
it
then
pulling
herself
together
seeing
that
lantier
busy
in
undoing
the
cords
was
not
even
looking
at
her
she
added
monsieur
boche
you
must
have
a
drink
and
she
went
and
fetched
a
quart
of
wine
and
some
glasses
just
then
poisson
passed
along
the
pavement
in
uniform
she
signaled
to
him
winking
her
eye
and
smiling
the
policeman
understood
perfectly
when
he
was
on
duty
and
anyone
winked
their
eye
to
him
it
meant
a
glass
of
wine
he
would
even
walk
for
hours
up
and
down
before
the
laundry
waiting
for
a
wink
then
so
as
not
to
be
seen
he
would
pass
through
the
courtyard
and
toss
off
the
liquor
in
secret
ah
ah
said
lantier
when
he
saw
him
enter
it
you
badingue
he
called
him
badingue
for
a
joke
just
to
show
how
little
he
cared
for
the
emperor
poisson
put
up
with
it
in
his
stiff
way
without
one
knowing
whether
it
really
annoyed
him
or
not
besides
the
two
men
though
separated
by
their
political
convictions
had
become
very
good
friends
you
know
that
the
emperor
was
once
a
policeman
in
london
said
boche
in
his
turn
yes
on
my
word
he
used
to
take
the
drunken
women
to
the
gervaise
had
filled
three
glasses
on
the
table
she
would
not
drink
herself
she
felt
too
sick
at
heart
but
she
stood
there
longing
to
see
what
the
box
contained
and
watching
lantier
remove
the
last
cords
before
raising
the
lid
lantier
took
his
glass
and
clinked
it
with
the
others
good
health
same
to
you
replied
boche
and
poisson
the
laundress
filled
the
glasses
again
the
three
men
wiped
their
lips
on
the
backs
of
their
hands
and
at
last
the
hatter
opened
the
box
it
was
full
of
a
jumble
of
newspapers
books
old
clothes
and
underlinen
in
bundles
he
took
out
successively
a
saucepan
a
pair
of
boots
a
bust
of
with
the
nose
broken
an
embroidered
shirt
and
a
pair
of
working
trousers
gervaise
could
smell
the
odor
of
tobacco
and
that
of
a
man
whose
linen
was
too
clean
one
who
took
care
only
of
the
outside
of
what
people
could
see
the
old
hat
was
no
longer
in
the
left
corner
there
was
a
pincushion
she
did
not
recognize
doubtless
a
present
from
some
woman
she
became
calmer
but
felt
a
vague
sadness
as
she
continued
to
watch
the
objects
that
appeared
wondering
if
they
were
from
her
time
or
from
the
time
of
others
i
say
badingue
do
you
know
this
resumed
lantier
he
thrust
under
his
nose
a
little
book
printed
at
brussels
the
amours
of
napoleon
illustrated
with
engravings
it
related
among
other
anecdotes
how
the
emperor
had
seduced
a
girl
of
thirteen
the
daughter
of
a
cook
and
the
picture
represented
napoleon
and
also
wearing
the
grand
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
pursuing
a
little
girl
who
was
trying
to
escape
his
lust
ah
that
it
exactly
exclaimed
boche
whose
slyly
ridiculous
instincts
felt
flattered
by
the
sight
it
always
happens
like
that
poisson
was
seized
with
consternation
and
he
could
not
find
a
word
to
say
in
the
emperor
defense
it
was
in
a
book
so
he
could
not
deny
it
then
lantier
continuing
to
push
the
picture
under
his
nose
in
a
jeering
way
he
extended
his
arms
and
exclaimed
well
so
what
lantier
did
reply
he
busied
himself
arranging
his
books
and
newspapers
on
a
shelf
in
the
wardrobe
he
seemed
upset
not
to
have
a
small
bookshelf
over
his
table
so
gervaise
promised
to
get
him
one
he
had
the
history
of
ten
years
by
louis
blanc
except
for
the
first
volume
lamartine
the
girondins
in
installments
the
mysteries
of
paris
and
the
wandering
jew
by
eugene
sue
and
a
quantity
of
booklets
on
philosophic
and
humanitarian
subjects
picked
up
from
used
book
dealers
his
newspapers
were
his
prized
possessions
a
collection
made
over
a
number
of
years
whenever
he
read
an
article
in
a
cafe
that
seemed
to
him
to
agree
with
his
own
ideas
he
would
buy
that
newspaper
and
keep
it
he
had
an
enormous
bundle
of
them
papers
of
every
date
and
every
title
piled
up
in
no
discernable
order
he
patted
them
and
said
to
the
other
two
you
see
that
no
one
else
can
boast
of
having
anything
to
match
it
you
ca
imagine
all
that
in
there
i
mean
if
they
put
into
practice
only
half
the
ideas
it
would
clean
up
the
social
order
overnight
that
would
be
good
medicine
for
your
emperor
and
all
his
stool
pigeons
the
policeman
red
mustache
and
beard
began
to
bristle
on
his
pale
face
and
he
interrupted
and
the
army
tell
me
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
that
lantier
flew
into
a
passion
he
banged
his
fists
down
on
the
newspapers
as
he
yelled
i
require
the
suppression
of
militarism
the
fraternity
of
peoples
i
require
the
abolition
of
privileges
of
titles
and
of
monopolies
i
require
the
equality
of
salaries
the
division
of
benefits
the
glorification
of
the
protectorate
all
liberties
do
you
hear
all
of
them
and
divorce
yes
yes
divorce
for
morality
insisted
boche
poisson
had
assumed
a
majestic
air
yet
if
i
wo
have
your
liberties
i
free
to
refuse
them
he
answered
lantier
was
choking
with
passion
if
you
do
want
them
if
you
do
want
them
he
replied
no
you
not
free
at
all
if
you
do
want
them
i
send
you
off
to
devil
island
yes
devil
island
with
your
emperor
and
all
the
rats
of
his
crew
they
always
quarreled
thus
every
time
they
met
gervaise
who
did
not
like
arguments
usually
interfered
she
roused
herself
from
the
torpor
into
which
the
sight
of
the
box
full
of
the
stale
perfume
of
her
past
love
had
plunged
her
and
she
drew
the
three
men
attention
to
the
glasses
ah
yes
said
lantier
becoming
suddenly
calm
and
taking
his
glass
good
health
good
health
replied
boche
and
poisson
clinking
glasses
with
him
boche
however
was
moving
nervously
about
troubled
by
an
anxiety
as
he
looked
at
the
policeman
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
all
this
between
ourselves
eh
monsieur
poisson
murmured
he
at
length
we
say
and
show
you
things
to
show
off
but
poisson
did
not
let
him
finish
he
placed
his
hand
upon
his
heart
as
though
to
explain
that
all
remained
buried
there
he
certainly
did
not
go
spying
about
on
his
friends
coupeau
arriving
they
emptied
a
second
quart
then
the
policeman
went
off
by
way
of
the
courtyard
and
resumed
his
stiff
and
measured
tread
along
the
pavement
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
arrangement
the
entire
routine
of
the
establishment
was
considerably
upset
lantier
had
his
own
separate
room
with
his
own
entrance
and
his
own
key
however
since
they
had
decided
not
to
close
off
the
door
between
the
rooms
he
usually
came
and
went
through
the
shop
besides
the
dirty
clothes
were
an
inconvenience
to
gervaise
because
her
husband
never
made
the
case
he
had
promised
and
she
had
to
tuck
the
dirty
laundry
into
any
odd
corner
she
could
find
they
usually
ended
up
under
the
bed
and
this
was
not
very
pleasant
on
warm
summer
nights
she
also
found
it
a
nuisance
having
to
make
up
bed
every
evening
in
the
shop
when
her
employees
worked
late
the
lad
had
to
sleep
in
a
chair
until
they
finished
goujet
had
mentioned
sending
etienne
to
lille
where
a
machinist
he
knew
was
looking
for
apprentices
as
the
boy
was
unhappy
at
home
and
eager
to
be
out
on
his
own
gervaise
seriously
considered
the
proposal
her
only
fear
was
that
lantier
would
refuse
since
he
had
come
to
live
with
them
solely
to
be
near
his
son
surely
he
would
want
to
lose
him
only
two
weeks
after
he
moved
in
however
he
approved
when
she
timidly
broached
the
matter
to
him
he
said
that
young
men
needed
to
see
a
bit
of
the
country
the
morning
that
etienne
left
lantier
made
a
speech
to
him
kissed
him
and
ended
by
saying
never
forget
that
a
workingman
is
not
a
slave
and
that
whoever
is
not
a
workingman
is
a
lazy
drone
the
household
was
now
able
to
get
into
the
new
routine
gervaise
became
accustomed
to
having
dirty
laundry
lying
all
around
lantier
was
forever
talking
of
important
business
deals
sometimes
he
went
out
wearing
fresh
linen
and
neatly
combed
he
would
stay
out
all
night
and
on
his
return
pretend
that
he
was
completely
exhausted
because
he
had
been
discussing
very
serious
matters
actually
he
was
merely
taking
life
easy
he
usually
slept
until
ten
in
the
afternoons
he
would
take
a
walk
if
the
weather
was
nice
if
it
was
raining
he
would
sit
in
the
shop
reading
his
newspaper
this
atmosphere
suited
him
he
always
felt
at
his
ease
with
women
and
enjoyed
listening
to
them
lantier
first
took
his
meals
at
francois
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
poissonniers
but
of
the
seven
days
in
the
week
he
dined
with
the
coupeaus
on
three
or
four
so
much
so
that
he
ended
by
offering
to
board
with
them
and
to
pay
them
fifteen
francs
every
saturday
from
that
time
he
scarcely
ever
left
the
house
but
made
himself
completely
at
home
there
morning
to
night
he
was
in
the
shop
even
giving
orders
and
attending
to
customers
lantier
did
like
the
wine
from
francois
so
he
persuaded
gervaise
to
buy
her
wine
from
vigouroux
the
then
he
decided
that
coudeloup
bread
was
not
baked
to
his
satisfaction
so
he
sent
augustine
to
the
viennese
bakery
in
the
faubourg
poissonniers
for
their
bread
he
changed
from
the
grocer
lehongre
but
kept
the
butcher
fat
charles
because
of
his
political
opinions
after
a
month
he
wanted
all
the
cooking
done
with
olive
oil
clemence
joked
that
with
a
provencal
like
him
you
could
never
wash
out
the
oil
stains
he
wanted
his
omelets
fried
on
both
sides
as
hard
as
pancakes
he
supervised
mother
cooking
wanting
his
steaks
cooked
like
shoe
leather
and
with
garlic
on
everything
he
got
angry
if
she
put
herbs
in
the
salad
they
just
weeds
and
some
of
them
might
be
poisonous
he
declared
his
favorite
soup
was
made
with
vermicelli
he
would
pour
in
half
a
bottle
of
olive
oil
only
he
and
gervaise
could
eat
this
soup
the
others
being
too
used
to
parisian
cooking
little
by
little
lantier
also
came
to
mixing
himself
up
in
the
affairs
of
the
family
as
the
lorilleuxs
always
grumbled
at
having
to
part
with
the
five
francs
for
mother
coupeau
he
explained
that
an
action
could
be
brought
against
them
they
must
think
that
they
had
a
set
of
fools
to
deal
with
it
was
ten
francs
a
month
which
they
ought
to
give
and
he
would
go
up
himself
for
the
ten
francs
so
boldly
and
yet
so
amiably
that
the
chainmaker
never
dared
refuse
them
madame
lerat
also
gave
two
pieces
now
mother
coupeau
could
have
kissed
lantier
hands
he
was
moreover
the
grand
arbiter
in
all
the
quarrels
between
the
old
woman
and
gervaise
whenever
the
laundress
in
a
moment
of
impatience
behaved
roughly
to
her
and
the
latter
went
and
cried
on
her
bed
he
hustled
them
about
and
made
them
kiss
each
other
asking
them
if
they
thought
themselves
amusing
with
their
bad
tempers
and
nana
too
she
was
being
brought
up
badly
according
to
his
idea
in
that
he
was
right
for
whenever
the
father
spanked
the
child
the
mother
took
her
part
and
if
the
mother
in
her
turn
boxed
her
ears
the
father
made
a
disturbance
nana
delighted
at
seeing
her
parents
abuse
each
other
and
knowing
that
she
was
forgiven
beforehand
was
up
to
all
kinds
of
tricks
her
latest
mania
was
to
go
and
play
in
the
blacksmith
shop
opposite
she
would
pass
the
entire
day
swinging
on
the
shafts
of
the
carts
she
would
hide
with
bands
of
urchins
in
the
remotest
corners
of
the
gray
courtyard
lighted
up
with
the
red
glare
of
the
forge
and
suddenly
she
would
reappear
running
and
shouting
unkempt
and
dirty
and
followed
by
the
troop
of
urchins
as
though
a
sudden
clash
of
the
hammers
had
frightened
the
ragamuffins
away
lantier
alone
could
scold
her
and
yet
she
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
get
over
him
this
tricky
little
girl
of
ten
would
walk
before
him
like
a
lady
swinging
herself
about
and
casting
side
glances
at
him
her
eyes
already
full
of
vice
he
had
ended
by
undertaking
her
education
he
taught
her
to
dance
and
to
talk
patois
a
year
passed
thus
in
the
neighborhood
it
was
thought
that
lantier
had
a
private
income
for
this
was
the
only
way
to
account
for
the
grand
style
of
living
no
doubt
gervaise
continued
to
earn
money
but
now
that
she
had
to
support
two
men
in
doing
nothing
the
shop
certainly
could
not
suffice
more
especially
as
the
shop
no
longer
had
so
good
a
reputation
customers
were
leaving
and
the
workwomen
were
tippling
from
morning
till
night
the
truth
was
that
lantier
paid
nothing
neither
for
rent
nor
board
during
the
first
months
he
had
paid
sums
on
account
then
he
had
contented
himself
with
speaking
of
a
large
amount
he
was
going
to
receive
with
which
later
on
he
would
pay
off
everything
in
a
lump
sum
gervaise
no
longer
dared
ask
him
for
a
centime
she
had
the
bread
the
wine
the
meat
all
on
credit
the
bills
increased
everywhere
at
the
rate
of
three
and
four
francs
a
day
she
had
not
paid
a
sou
to
the
furniture
dealer
nor
to
the
three
comrades
the
mason
the
carpenter
and
the
painter
all
these
people
commenced
to
grumble
and
she
was
no
longer
greeted
with
the
same
politeness
at
the
shops
she
was
as
though
intoxicated
by
a
mania
for
getting
into
debt
she
tried
to
drown
her
thoughts
ordered
the
most
expensive
things
and
gave
full
freedom
to
her
gluttony
now
that
she
no
longer
paid
for
anything
she
remained
withal
very
honest
at
heart
dreaming
of
earning
from
morning
to
night
hundreds
of
francs
though
she
did
not
exactly
know
how
to
enable
her
to
distribute
handfuls
of
pieces
to
her
tradespeople
in
short
she
was
sinking
and
as
she
sank
lower
and
lower
she
talked
of
extending
her
business
instead
she
went
deeper
into
debt
clemence
left
around
the
middle
of
the
summer
because
there
was
no
longer
enough
work
for
two
women
and
she
had
not
been
paid
in
several
weeks
during
this
impending
ruin
coupeau
and
lantier
were
in
effect
devouring
the
shop
and
growing
fat
on
the
ruin
of
the
establishment
at
table
they
would
challenge
each
other
to
take
more
helpings
and
slap
their
rounded
stomachs
to
make
more
room
for
dessert
the
great
subject
of
conversation
in
the
neighborhood
was
as
to
whether
lantier
had
really
gone
back
to
his
old
footing
with
gervaise
on
this
point
opinions
were
divided
according
to
the
lorilleuxs
was
doing
everything
she
could
to
hook
lantier
again
but
he
would
no
longer
have
anything
to
do
with
her
because
she
was
getting
old
and
faded
and
he
had
plenty
of
younger
girls
that
were
prettier
on
the
other
hand
according
to
the
boches
gervaise
had
gone
back
to
her
former
mate
the
very
first
night
just
as
soon
as
poor
coupeau
had
gone
to
sleep
the
picture
was
not
pretty
but
there
were
a
lot
of
worse
things
in
life
so
folks
ended
by
accepting
the
threesome
as
altogether
natural
in
fact
they
thought
them
rather
nice
since
there
were
never
any
fights
and
the
outward
decencies
remained
certainly
if
you
stuck
your
nose
into
some
of
the
other
neighborhood
households
you
could
smell
far
worse
things
so
what
if
they
slept
together
like
a
nice
little
family
it
never
kept
the
neighbors
awake
besides
everyone
was
still
very
much
impressed
by
lantier
good
manners
his
charm
helped
greatly
to
keep
tongues
from
wagging
indeed
when
the
fruit
dealer
insisted
to
the
tripe
seller
that
there
had
been
no
intimacies
the
latter
appeared
to
feel
that
this
was
really
too
bad
because
it
made
the
coupeaus
less
interesting
gervaise
was
quite
at
her
ease
in
this
matter
and
not
much
troubled
with
these
thoughts
things
reached
the
point
that
she
was
accused
of
being
heartless
the
family
did
not
understand
why
she
continued
to
bear
a
grudge
against
the
hatter
madame
lerat
now
came
over
every
evening
she
considered
lantier
as
utterly
irresistible
and
said
that
most
ladies
would
be
happy
to
fall
into
his
arms
madame
boche
declared
that
her
own
virtue
would
not
be
safe
if
she
were
ten
years
younger
there
was
a
sort
of
silent
conspiracy
to
push
gervaise
into
the
arms
of
lantier
as
if
all
the
women
around
her
felt
driven
to
satisfy
their
own
longings
by
giving
her
a
lover
gervaise
did
understand
this
because
she
no
longer
found
lantier
seductive
certainly
he
had
changed
for
the
better
he
had
gotten
a
sort
of
education
in
the
cafes
and
political
meetings
but
she
knew
him
well
she
could
pierce
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
and
she
found
things
there
that
still
gave
her
the
shivers
well
if
the
others
found
him
so
attractive
why
did
they
try
it
themselves
in
the
end
she
suggested
this
one
day
to
virginie
who
seemed
the
most
eager
then
to
excite
gervaise
madame
lerat
and
virginie
told
her
of
the
love
of
lantier
and
tall
clemence
yes
she
had
not
noticed
anything
herself
but
as
soon
as
she
went
out
on
an
errand
the
hatter
would
bring
the
workgirl
into
his
room
now
people
met
them
out
together
he
probably
went
to
see
her
at
her
own
place
well
said
the
laundress
her
voice
trembling
slightly
what
can
it
matter
to
me
she
looked
straight
into
virginie
eyes
did
this
woman
still
have
it
in
for
her
virginie
replied
with
an
air
of
innocence
it
ca
matter
to
you
of
course
only
you
ought
to
advise
him
to
break
off
with
that
girl
who
is
sure
to
cause
him
some
unpleasantness
the
worst
of
it
was
that
lantier
feeling
himself
supported
by
public
opinion
changed
altogether
in
his
behavior
towards
gervaise
now
whenever
he
shook
hands
with
her
he
held
her
fingers
for
a
minute
between
his
own
he
tried
her
with
his
glance
fixing
a
bold
look
upon
her
in
which
she
clearly
read
that
he
wanted
her
if
he
passed
behind
her
he
dug
his
knees
into
her
skirt
or
breathed
upon
her
neck
yet
he
waited
a
while
before
being
rough
and
openly
declaring
himself
but
one
evening
finding
himself
alone
with
her
he
pushed
her
before
him
without
a
word
and
viewed
her
all
trembling
against
the
wall
at
the
back
of
the
shop
and
tried
to
kiss
her
it
so
chanced
that
goujet
entered
just
at
that
moment
then
she
struggled
and
escaped
and
all
three
exchanged
a
few
words
as
though
nothing
had
happened
goujet
his
face
deadly
pale
looked
on
the
ground
fancying
that
he
had
disturbed
them
and
that
she
had
merely
struggled
so
as
not
to
be
kissed
before
a
third
party
the
next
day
gervaise
moved
restlessly
about
the
shop
she
was
miserable
and
unable
to
iron
even
a
single
handkerchief
she
only
wanted
to
see
goujet
and
explain
to
him
how
lantier
happened
to
have
pinned
her
against
the
wall
but
since
etienne
had
gone
to
lille
she
had
hesitated
to
visit
goujet
forge
where
she
felt
she
would
be
greeted
by
his
fellow
workers
with
secret
laughter
this
afternoon
however
she
yielded
to
the
impulse
she
took
an
empty
basket
and
went
out
under
the
pretext
of
going
for
the
petticoats
of
her
customer
on
rue
des
then
when
she
reached
rue
marcadet
she
walked
very
slowly
in
front
of
the
bolt
factory
hoping
for
a
lucky
meeting
goujet
must
have
been
hoping
to
see
her
too
for
within
five
minutes
he
came
out
as
if
by
chance
you
have
been
on
an
errand
he
said
smiling
and
now
you
are
on
your
way
home
actually
gervaise
had
her
back
toward
rue
des
poissonniers
he
only
said
that
for
something
to
say
they
walked
together
up
toward
montmartre
but
without
her
taking
his
arm
they
wanted
to
get
a
bit
away
from
the
factory
so
as
not
to
seem
to
be
having
a
rendezvous
in
front
of
it
they
turned
into
a
vacant
lot
between
a
sawmill
and
a
button
factory
it
was
like
a
small
green
meadow
there
was
even
a
goat
tied
to
a
stake
it
strange
remarked
gervaise
you
think
you
were
in
the
country
they
went
to
sit
under
a
dead
tree
gervaise
placed
the
laundry
basket
by
her
feet
yes
gervaise
said
i
had
an
errand
to
do
and
so
i
came
out
she
felt
deeply
ashamed
and
was
afraid
to
try
to
explain
yet
she
realized
that
they
had
come
here
to
discuss
it
it
remained
a
troublesome
burden
then
all
in
a
rush
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
told
him
of
the
death
that
morning
of
madame
bijard
her
washerwoman
she
had
suffered
horrible
agonies
her
husband
caused
it
by
kicking
her
in
the
stomach
she
said
in
a
monotone
he
must
have
damaged
her
insides
dieu
she
was
in
agony
for
three
days
with
her
stomach
all
swelled
up
plenty
of
scoundrels
have
been
sent
to
the
galleys
for
less
than
that
but
the
courts
wo
concern
themselves
with
a
especially
since
the
woman
said
she
had
hurt
herself
falling
she
wanted
to
save
him
from
the
scaffold
but
she
screamed
all
night
long
before
she
died
goujet
clenched
his
hands
and
remained
silent
she
weaned
her
youngest
only
two
weeks
ago
little
jules
gervaise
went
on
that
lucky
for
the
baby
he
wo
have
to
suffer
still
there
the
child
lalie
and
she
has
two
babies
to
look
after
she
eight
yet
but
she
already
sensible
her
father
will
beat
her
now
even
more
than
before
goujet
gazed
at
her
silently
then
his
lips
trembling
you
hurt
me
yesterday
yes
you
hurt
me
badly
gervaise
turned
pale
and
clasped
her
hands
as
he
continued
i
thought
it
would
happen
you
should
have
told
me
you
should
have
trusted
me
enough
to
confess
what
was
happening
so
as
not
to
leave
me
thinking
that
goujet
could
not
finish
the
sentence
gervaise
stood
up
realizing
that
he
thought
she
had
gone
back
with
lantier
as
the
neighbors
asserted
stretching
her
arms
toward
him
she
cried
no
no
i
swear
to
you
he
was
pushing
against
me
trying
to
kiss
me
but
his
face
never
even
touched
mine
it
true
and
that
was
the
first
time
he
tried
oh
i
swear
on
my
life
on
the
life
of
my
children
oh
believe
me
goujet
was
shaking
his
head
gervaise
said
slowly
monsieur
goujet
you
know
me
well
you
know
that
i
do
not
lie
on
my
word
of
honor
it
never
happened
and
it
never
will
do
you
understand
never
i
be
the
lowest
of
the
low
if
it
ever
happened
and
i
deserve
the
friendship
of
an
honest
man
like
you
she
seemed
so
sincere
that
he
took
her
hand
and
made
her
sit
down
again
he
could
breathe
freely
his
heart
rejoiced
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
held
her
hand
like
this
he
pressed
it
in
his
own
and
they
both
sat
quietly
for
a
time
i
know
your
mother
does
like
me
gervaise
said
in
a
low
voice
do
bother
to
deny
it
we
owe
you
so
much
money
he
squeezed
her
hand
tightly
he
did
want
to
talk
of
money
finally
he
said
i
been
thinking
of
something
for
a
long
time
you
are
not
happy
where
you
are
my
mother
tells
me
things
are
getting
worse
for
you
well
then
we
can
go
away
together
she
did
understand
at
first
and
stared
at
him
startled
by
this
sudden
declaration
of
a
love
that
he
had
never
mentioned
finally
she
asked
what
do
you
mean
we
get
away
from
here
he
said
looking
down
at
the
ground
we
go
live
somewhere
else
in
belgium
if
you
wish
with
both
of
us
working
we
would
soon
be
very
comfortable
gervaise
flushed
she
thought
she
would
have
felt
less
shame
if
he
had
taken
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
goujet
was
an
odd
fellow
proposing
to
elope
just
the
way
it
happens
in
novels
well
she
had
seen
plenty
of
workingmen
making
up
to
married
women
but
they
never
took
them
even
as
far
as
ah
monsieur
goujet
she
murmured
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
do
you
see
he
said
there
would
only
be
the
two
of
us
it
annoys
me
having
others
around
having
regained
her
however
she
refused
his
proposal
it
impossible
monsieur
goujet
it
would
be
very
wrong
i
a
married
woman
and
i
have
children
we
soon
regret
it
i
know
you
care
for
me
and
i
care
for
you
also
too
much
to
let
you
do
anything
foolish
much
better
to
stay
just
as
we
are
we
have
respect
for
each
other
and
that
a
lot
it
been
a
comfort
to
me
many
times
when
people
in
our
situation
stay
on
the
straight
it
is
better
in
the
end
he
nodded
his
head
as
he
listened
he
agreed
with
her
and
was
unable
to
offer
any
arguments
suddenly
he
pulled
her
into
his
arms
and
kissed
her
crushing
her
then
he
let
her
go
and
said
nothing
more
about
their
love
she
was
angry
she
felt
they
had
earned
that
small
moment
of
pleasure
goujet
now
did
know
what
to
do
with
his
hands
so
he
went
around
picking
dandelions
and
tossing
them
into
her
basket
this
amused
him
and
gradually
soothed
him
gervaise
was
becoming
relaxed
and
cheerful
when
they
finally
left
the
vacant
lot
they
walked
side
by
side
and
talked
of
how
much
etienne
liked
being
at
lille
her
basket
was
full
of
yellow
dandelions
gervaise
at
heart
did
not
feel
as
courageous
when
with
lantier
as
she
said
she
was
indeed
perfectly
resolved
not
to
hear
his
flattery
even
with
the
slightest
interest
but
she
was
afraid
if
ever
he
should
touch
her
of
her
old
cowardice
of
that
feebleness
and
gloominess
into
which
she
allowed
herself
to
glide
just
to
please
people
lantier
however
did
not
avow
his
affection
he
several
times
found
himself
alone
with
her
and
kept
quiet
he
seemed
to
think
of
marrying
the
a
woman
of
and
very
well
preserved
gervaise
would
talk
of
the
in
goujet
presence
so
as
to
set
his
mind
at
ease
she
would
say
to
virginie
and
madame
lerat
whenever
they
were
singing
the
hatter
praises
that
he
could
very
well
do
without
her
admiration
because
all
the
women
of
the
neighborhood
were
smitten
with
him
coupeau
went
braying
about
everywhere
that
lantier
was
a
friend
and
a
true
one
people
might
jabber
about
them
he
knew
what
he
knew
and
did
not
care
a
straw
for
their
gossip
for
he
had
respectability
on
his
side
when
they
all
three
went
out
walking
on
sundays
he
made
his
wife
and
the
hatter
walk
before
him
just
by
way
of
swaggering
in
the
street
and
he
watched
the
people
quite
prepared
to
administer
a
drubbing
if
anyone
had
ventured
on
the
least
joke
it
was
true
that
he
regarded
lantier
as
a
bit
of
a
high
flyer
he
accused
him
of
avoiding
hard
liquor
and
teased
him
because
he
could
read
and
spoke
like
an
educated
man
still
he
accepted
him
as
a
regular
comrade
they
were
ideally
suited
to
each
other
and
friendship
between
men
is
more
substantial
than
love
for
a
woman
coupeau
and
lantier
were
forever
going
out
junketing
together
lantier
would
now
borrow
money
from
gervaise
ten
francs
twenty
francs
at
a
time
whenever
he
smelt
there
was
money
in
the
house
then
on
those
days
he
would
keep
coupeau
away
from
his
work
talk
of
some
distant
errand
and
take
him
with
him
then
seated
opposite
to
each
other
in
the
corner
of
some
neighboring
eating
house
they
would
guzzle
fancy
dishes
which
one
can
not
get
at
home
and
wash
them
down
with
bottles
of
expensive
wine
the
would
have
preferred
to
booze
in
a
less
pretentious
place
but
he
was
impressed
by
the
aristocratic
tastes
of
lantier
who
would
discover
on
the
bill
of
fare
dishes
with
the
most
extraordinary
names
it
was
hard
to
understand
a
man
so
hard
to
please
maybe
it
was
from
being
a
southerner
lantier
did
like
anything
too
rich
and
argued
about
every
dish
sending
back
meat
that
was
too
salty
or
too
peppery
he
hated
drafts
if
a
door
was
left
open
he
complained
loudly
at
the
same
time
he
was
very
stingy
only
giving
the
waiter
a
tip
of
two
sous
for
a
meal
of
seven
or
eight
francs
he
was
treated
with
respect
in
spite
of
that
the
pair
were
well
known
along
the
exterior
boulevards
from
batignolles
to
belleville
they
would
go
to
the
grand
rue
des
batignolles
to
eat
tripe
cooked
in
the
caen
style
at
the
foot
of
montmartre
they
obtained
the
best
oysters
in
the
neighborhood
at
the
town
of
when
they
ventured
to
the
top
of
the
height
as
far
as
the
galette
windmill
they
had
a
stewed
rabbit
the
lilacs
in
the
rue
des
martyrs
had
a
reputation
for
their
calf
head
whilst
the
restaurant
of
the
golden
lion
and
the
two
chestnut
trees
in
the
chaussee
clignancourt
served
them
stewed
kidneys
which
made
them
lick
their
lips
usually
they
went
toward
belleville
where
they
had
tables
reserved
for
them
at
some
places
of
such
excellent
repute
that
you
could
order
anything
with
your
eyes
closed
these
eating
sprees
were
always
surreptitious
and
the
next
day
they
would
refer
to
them
indirectly
while
playing
with
the
potatoes
served
by
gervaise
once
lantier
brought
a
woman
with
him
to
the
galette
windmill
and
coupeau
left
immediately
after
dessert
one
naturally
can
not
both
guzzle
and
work
so
that
ever
since
the
hatter
was
made
one
of
the
family
the
who
was
already
pretty
lazy
had
got
to
the
point
of
never
touching
a
tool
when
tired
of
doing
nothing
he
sometimes
let
himself
be
prevailed
upon
to
take
a
job
then
his
comrade
would
look
him
up
and
chaff
him
unmercifully
when
he
found
him
hanging
to
his
knotty
cord
like
a
smoked
ham
and
he
would
call
to
him
to
come
down
and
have
a
glass
of
wine
and
that
settled
it
the
would
send
the
job
to
blazes
and
commence
a
booze
which
lasted
days
and
weeks
oh
it
was
a
famous
booze
a
general
review
of
all
the
dram
shops
of
the
neighborhood
the
intoxication
of
the
morning
slept
off
by
midday
and
renewed
in
the
evening
the
goes
of
vitriol
succeeded
one
another
becoming
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
night
like
the
venetian
lanterns
of
an
illumination
until
the
last
candle
disappeared
with
the
last
glass
that
rogue
of
a
hatter
never
kept
on
to
the
end
he
let
the
other
get
elevated
then
gave
him
the
slip
and
returned
home
smiling
in
his
pleasant
way
he
could
drink
a
great
deal
without
people
noticing
it
when
one
got
to
know
him
well
one
could
only
tell
it
by
his
eyes
and
his
overbold
behavior
to
women
the
on
the
contrary
became
quite
disgusting
and
could
no
longer
drink
without
putting
himself
into
a
beastly
state
thus
towards
the
beginning
of
november
coupeau
went
in
for
a
booze
which
ended
in
a
most
dirty
manner
both
for
himself
and
the
others
the
day
before
he
had
been
offered
a
job
this
time
lantier
was
full
of
fine
sentiments
he
lauded
work
because
work
ennobles
a
man
in
the
morning
he
even
rose
before
it
was
light
for
he
gravely
wished
to
accompany
his
friend
to
the
workshop
honoring
in
him
the
workman
really
worthy
of
the
name
but
when
they
arrived
before
the
little
civet
which
was
just
opening
they
entered
to
have
a
plum
in
brandy
only
one
merely
to
drink
together
to
the
firm
observance
of
a
good
resolution
on
a
bench
opposite
the
counter
and
with
his
back
against
the
wall
was
sitting
smoking
with
a
sulky
look
on
his
face
hallo
here
bibi
having
a
snooze
said
coupeau
are
you
down
in
the
dumps
old
bloke
no
no
replied
the
comrade
stretching
his
arm
it
the
employers
who
disgust
me
i
sent
mine
to
the
right
about
yesterday
they
all
toads
and
scoundrels
accepted
a
plum
he
was
no
doubt
waiting
there
on
that
bench
for
someone
to
stand
him
a
drink
lantier
however
took
the
part
of
the
employers
they
often
had
some
very
hard
times
as
he
who
had
been
in
business
himself
well
knew
the
workers
were
a
bad
lot
forever
getting
drunk
they
did
take
their
work
seriously
sometimes
they
quit
in
the
middle
of
a
job
and
only
returned
when
they
needed
something
in
their
pockets
then
lantier
would
switch
his
attack
to
the
employers
they
were
nasty
exploiters
regular
cannibals
but
he
could
sleep
with
a
clear
conscience
as
he
had
always
acted
as
a
friend
to
his
employees
he
did
want
to
get
rich
the
way
others
did
let
be
off
my
boy
he
said
speaking
to
coupeau
we
must
be
going
or
we
shall
be
late
followed
them
swinging
his
arms
outside
the
sun
was
scarcely
rising
the
pale
daylight
seemed
dirtied
by
the
muddy
reflection
of
the
pavement
it
had
rained
the
night
before
and
it
was
very
mild
the
gas
lamps
had
just
been
turned
out
the
rue
des
poissonniers
in
which
shreds
of
night
rent
by
the
houses
still
floated
was
gradually
filling
with
the
dull
tramp
of
the
workmen
descending
towards
paris
coupeau
with
his
bag
slung
over
his
shoulder
walked
along
in
the
imposing
manner
of
a
fellow
who
feels
in
good
form
for
a
change
he
turned
round
and
asked
bibi
do
you
want
a
job
the
boss
told
me
to
bring
a
pal
if
i
could
no
thanks
answered
i
purging
myself
you
should
ask
he
was
looking
for
something
yesterday
wait
a
minute
is
most
likely
in
there
and
as
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
street
they
indeed
caught
sight
of
inside
pere
colombe
in
spite
of
the
early
hour
was
flaring
the
shutters
down
the
gas
lighted
lantier
stood
at
the
door
telling
coupeau
to
make
haste
because
they
had
only
ten
minutes
left
what
you
going
to
work
for
that
rascal
bourguignon
yelled
when
the
had
spoken
to
him
you
never
catch
me
in
his
hutch
again
no
i
rather
go
till
next
year
with
my
tongue
hanging
out
of
my
mouth
but
old
fellow
you
wo
stay
three
days
and
it
i
who
tell
you
so
really
now
is
it
such
a
dirty
hole
asked
coupeau
anxiously
oh
it
about
the
dirtiest
you
ca
move
there
the
ape
for
ever
on
your
back
and
such
queer
ways
too
a
missus
who
always
says
drunk
a
shop
where
you
must
spit
i
sent
them
to
the
right
about
the
first
night
you
know
good
now
i
warned
i
sha
stop
there
for
ever
i
just
go
this
morning
to
see
what
it
like
but
if
the
boss
bothers
me
i
catch
him
up
and
plant
him
upon
his
missus
you
know
bang
together
like
two
fillets
of
sole
then
coupeau
thanked
his
friend
for
the
useful
information
and
shook
his
hand
as
he
was
about
to
leave
cursed
angrily
was
that
lousy
bourguignon
going
to
stop
them
from
having
a
drink
were
they
free
any
more
he
could
well
wait
another
five
minutes
lantier
came
in
to
share
in
the
round
and
they
stood
together
at
the
counter
with
his
smock
black
with
dirt
and
his
cap
flattened
on
his
head
had
recently
been
proclaimed
king
of
pigs
and
drunks
after
he
had
eaten
a
salad
of
live
beetles
and
chewed
a
piece
of
a
dead
cat
say
there
old
borgia
he
called
to
pere
colombe
give
us
some
of
your
yellow
stuff
first
class
mule
wine
and
when
pere
colombe
pale
and
quiet
in
his
waistcoat
had
filled
the
four
glasses
these
gentlemen
tossed
them
off
so
as
not
to
let
the
liquor
get
flat
that
does
some
good
when
it
goes
down
murmured
the
comic
had
a
story
to
tell
he
was
so
drunk
on
the
friday
that
his
comrades
had
stuck
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
with
a
handful
of
plaster
anyone
else
would
have
died
of
it
he
merely
strutted
about
and
puffed
out
his
chest
do
you
gentlemen
require
anything
more
asked
pere
colombe
in
his
oily
voice
yes
fill
us
up
again
said
lantier
it
my
turn
now
they
were
talking
of
women
had
taken
his
girl
to
an
aunt
at
montrouge
on
the
previous
sunday
coupeau
asked
for
the
news
of
the
indian
mail
a
washerwoman
of
chaillot
who
was
known
in
the
establishment
they
were
about
to
drink
when
loudly
called
to
goujet
and
lorilleux
who
were
passing
by
they
came
just
to
the
door
but
would
not
enter
the
blacksmith
did
not
care
to
take
anything
the
chainmaker
pale
and
shivering
held
in
his
pocket
the
gold
chains
he
was
going
to
deliver
and
he
coughed
and
asked
them
to
excuse
him
saying
that
the
least
drop
of
brandy
would
nearly
make
him
split
his
sides
there
are
hypocrites
for
you
grunted
i
bet
they
have
their
drinks
on
the
sly
and
when
he
had
poked
his
nose
in
his
glass
he
attacked
pere
colombe
vile
druggist
you
changed
the
bottle
you
know
it
no
good
your
trying
to
palm
your
cheap
stuff
off
on
me
the
day
had
advanced
a
doubtful
sort
of
light
lit
up
where
the
landlord
was
turning
out
the
gas
coupeau
found
excuses
for
his
who
could
not
stand
drink
which
after
all
was
no
crime
he
even
approved
goujet
behavior
for
it
was
a
real
blessing
never
to
be
thirsty
and
as
he
talked
of
going
off
to
his
work
lantier
with
his
grand
air
of
a
gentleman
sharply
gave
him
a
lesson
one
at
least
stood
one
turn
before
sneaking
off
one
should
not
leave
one
friends
like
a
mean
blackguard
even
when
going
to
do
one
duty
is
he
going
to
badger
us
much
longer
about
his
work
cried
so
this
is
your
turn
sir
asked
pere
colombe
of
coupeau
the
latter
paid
but
when
it
came
to
turn
he
whispered
to
the
landlord
who
refused
with
a
shake
of
the
head
understood
and
again
set
to
abusing
the
old
jew
colombe
what
a
rascal
like
him
dared
to
behave
in
that
way
to
a
comrade
everywhere
else
one
could
get
drink
on
tick
it
was
only
in
such
low
that
one
was
insulted
the
landlord
remained
calm
leaning
his
big
fists
on
the
edge
of
the
counter
he
politely
said
lend
the
gentleman
some
money
that
will
be
far
simpler
dieu
yes
i
lend
him
some
yelled
here
bibi
throw
this
money
in
his
face
the
limb
of
satan
then
excited
and
annoyed
at
seeing
coupeau
with
his
bag
slung
over
his
shoulder
he
continued
speaking
to
the
you
look
like
a
drop
your
brat
it
give
you
a
coupeau
hesitated
an
instant
and
then
quietly
as
though
he
had
only
made
up
his
mind
after
considerable
reflection
he
laid
his
bag
on
the
ground
saying
it
too
late
now
i
go
to
bourguignon
after
lunch
i
tell
him
that
the
missus
was
ill
listen
pere
colombe
i
leave
my
tools
under
this
seat
and
i
call
for
them
at
twelve
lantier
gave
his
blessing
to
this
arrangement
with
an
approving
nod
labor
was
necessary
yes
but
when
you
with
good
friends
courtesy
comes
first
now
the
four
had
five
hours
of
idleness
before
them
they
were
full
of
noisy
merriment
coupeau
was
especially
relieved
they
had
another
round
and
then
went
to
a
small
bar
that
had
a
billiard
table
at
first
lantier
turned
up
his
nose
at
this
establishment
because
it
was
rather
shabby
so
much
liquor
had
been
spilled
on
the
billiard
table
that
the
balls
stuck
to
it
once
the
game
got
started
though
lantier
recovered
his
good
humor
and
began
to
flaunt
his
extraordinary
knack
with
a
cue
when
lunch
time
came
coupeau
had
an
idea
he
stamped
his
feet
and
cried
we
must
go
and
fetch
i
know
where
he
working
take
him
to
mere
louis
to
have
some
pettitoes
the
idea
was
greeted
with
acclamation
yes
otherwise
was
no
doubt
in
want
of
some
pettitoes
they
started
off
coupeau
took
them
to
the
bolt
factory
in
the
rue
marcadet
as
they
arrived
a
good
half
hour
before
the
time
the
workmen
came
out
the
gave
a
youngster
two
sous
to
go
in
and
tell
that
his
wife
was
ill
and
wanted
him
at
once
the
blacksmith
made
his
appearance
waddling
in
his
walk
looking
very
calm
and
scenting
a
ah
you
jokers
said
he
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
them
hiding
in
a
doorway
i
guessed
it
well
what
are
we
going
to
eat
at
mother
louis
whilst
they
sucked
the
little
bones
of
the
pettitoes
they
again
fell
to
abusing
the
employers
otherwise
related
that
they
had
a
most
pressing
order
to
execute
at
the
shop
oh
the
ape
was
pleasant
for
the
time
being
one
could
be
late
and
he
would
say
nothing
he
no
doubt
considered
himself
lucky
when
one
turned
up
at
all
at
any
rate
no
boss
would
dare
to
throw
out
the
door
because
you
could
find
lads
of
his
capacity
any
more
after
the
pettitoes
they
had
an
omelet
when
each
of
them
had
emptied
his
bottle
mere
louis
brought
out
some
auvergne
wine
thick
enough
to
cut
with
a
knife
the
party
was
really
warming
up
what
do
you
think
is
the
ape
latest
idea
cried
at
dessert
why
he
been
and
put
a
bell
up
in
his
shed
a
bell
good
for
slaves
ah
well
it
can
ring
they
wo
catch
me
again
at
the
anvil
for
five
days
past
i
been
sticking
there
i
may
give
myself
a
rest
now
if
he
deducts
anything
i
send
him
to
blazes
i
said
coupeau
with
an
air
of
importance
i
obliged
to
leave
you
i
off
to
work
yes
i
promised
my
wife
amuse
yourselves
my
spirit
you
know
remains
with
my
pals
the
others
chuffed
him
but
he
seemed
so
decided
that
they
all
accompanied
him
when
he
talked
of
going
to
fetch
his
tools
from
pere
colombe
he
took
his
bag
from
under
the
seat
and
laid
it
on
the
ground
before
him
whilst
they
had
a
final
drink
but
at
one
the
party
was
still
standing
drinks
then
coupeau
with
a
bored
gesture
placed
the
tools
back
again
under
the
seat
they
were
in
his
way
he
could
not
get
near
the
counter
without
stumbling
against
them
it
was
too
absurd
he
would
go
to
bourguignon
on
the
morrow
the
other
four
who
were
quarrelling
about
the
question
of
salaries
were
not
at
all
surprised
when
the
without
any
explanation
proposed
a
little
stroll
on
the
boulevard
just
to
stretch
their
legs
they
did
go
very
far
they
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
out
in
the
fresh
air
without
even
consulting
each
other
with
so
much
as
a
nudge
they
slowly
and
instinctively
ascended
the
rue
des
poissonniers
where
they
went
to
francois
and
had
a
glass
of
wine
out
of
the
bottle
lantier
pushed
his
comrades
inside
the
private
room
at
the
back
it
was
a
narrow
place
with
only
one
table
in
it
and
was
separated
from
the
shop
by
a
dull
glazed
partition
he
liked
to
do
his
drinking
in
private
rooms
because
it
seemed
more
respectable
did
they
like
it
here
it
was
as
comfortable
as
being
at
home
you
could
even
take
a
nap
here
without
being
embarrassed
he
called
for
the
newspaper
spread
it
out
open
before
him
and
looked
through
it
frowning
the
while
coupeau
and
had
commenced
a
game
of
piquet
two
bottles
of
wine
and
five
glasses
were
scattered
about
the
table
they
emptied
their
glasses
then
lantier
read
out
loud
a
frightful
crime
has
just
spread
consternation
throughout
the
commune
of
gaillon
department
of
a
son
has
killed
his
father
with
blows
from
a
spade
in
order
to
rob
him
of
thirty
sous
they
all
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
there
was
a
fellow
whom
they
would
have
taken
great
pleasure
in
seeing
guillotined
no
the
guillotine
was
not
enough
he
deserved
to
be
cut
into
little
pieces
the
story
of
an
infanticide
equally
aroused
their
indignation
but
the
hatter
highly
moral
found
excuses
for
the
woman
putting
all
the
wrong
on
the
back
of
her
husband
for
after
all
if
some
beast
of
a
man
had
not
put
the
wretched
woman
into
the
way
of
bleak
poverty
she
could
not
have
drowned
it
in
a
water
closet
they
were
most
delighted
though
by
the
exploit
of
a
marquis
who
coming
out
of
a
dance
hall
at
two
in
the
morning
had
defended
himself
against
an
attack
by
three
blackguards
on
the
boulevard
des
invalides
without
taking
off
his
gloves
he
had
disposed
of
the
first
two
villains
by
ramming
his
head
into
their
stomachs
and
then
had
marched
the
third
one
off
to
the
police
what
a
man
too
bad
he
was
a
noble
listen
to
this
now
continued
lantier
here
some
society
news
marriage
is
arranged
between
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
countess
de
bretigny
and
the
young
baron
de
valancay
to
his
majesty
the
wedding
trousseau
will
contain
more
than
three
hundred
thousand
francs
worth
of
lace
what
that
to
us
interrupted
we
do
want
to
know
the
color
of
her
mantle
the
girl
can
have
no
end
of
lace
nevertheless
she
see
the
folly
of
loving
as
lantier
seemed
about
to
continue
his
reading
otherwise
took
the
newspaper
from
him
and
sat
upon
it
saying
ah
no
that
enough
this
is
all
the
paper
is
good
for
meanwhile
who
had
been
looking
at
his
hand
triumphantly
banged
his
fist
down
on
the
table
he
scored
i
got
the
revolution
he
exulted
you
out
of
luck
comrade
the
others
told
coupeau
they
ordered
two
fresh
bottles
the
glasses
were
filled
up
again
as
fast
as
they
were
emptied
the
booze
increased
towards
five
it
began
to
get
disgusting
so
much
so
that
lantier
kept
very
quiet
thinking
of
how
to
give
the
others
the
slip
brawling
and
throwing
the
wine
about
was
no
longer
his
style
just
then
coupeau
stood
up
to
make
the
drunkard
sign
of
the
cross
touching
his
head
he
pronounced
montpernasse
then
menilmonte
as
he
brought
his
hand
to
his
right
shoulder
bagnolet
giving
himself
a
blow
in
the
chest
and
wound
up
by
saying
stewed
rabbit
three
times
as
he
hit
himself
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
then
the
hatter
took
advantage
of
the
clamor
which
greeted
the
performance
of
this
feat
and
quietly
made
for
the
door
his
comrades
did
not
even
notice
his
departure
he
had
already
had
a
pretty
good
dose
but
once
outside
he
shook
himself
and
regained
his
and
he
quietly
made
for
the
shop
where
he
told
gervaise
that
coupeau
was
with
some
friends
two
days
passed
by
the
had
not
returned
he
was
reeling
about
the
neighborhood
but
no
one
knew
exactly
where
several
persons
however
stated
that
they
had
seen
him
at
mother
baquet
at
the
butterfly
and
at
the
little
old
man
with
a
cough
only
some
said
that
he
was
alone
whilst
others
affirmed
that
he
was
in
the
company
of
seven
or
eight
drunkards
like
himself
gervaise
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
a
resigned
sort
of
way
dieu
she
just
had
to
get
used
to
it
she
never
ran
about
after
her
old
man
she
even
went
out
of
her
way
if
she
caught
sight
of
him
inside
a
wineshop
so
as
to
not
anger
him
and
she
waited
at
home
till
he
returned
listening
at
to
hear
if
he
was
snoring
outside
the
door
he
would
sleep
on
a
rubbish
heap
or
on
a
seat
or
in
a
piece
of
waste
land
or
across
a
gutter
on
the
morrow
after
having
only
badly
slept
off
his
booze
of
the
day
before
he
would
start
off
again
knocking
at
the
doors
of
all
the
consolation
dealers
plunging
afresh
into
a
furious
wandering
in
the
midst
of
nips
of
spirits
glasses
of
wine
losing
his
friends
and
then
finding
them
again
going
regular
voyages
from
which
he
returned
in
a
state
of
stupor
seeing
the
streets
dance
the
night
fall
and
the
day
break
without
any
other
thought
than
to
drink
and
sleep
off
the
effects
wherever
he
happened
to
be
when
in
the
latter
state
the
world
was
ended
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
on
the
second
day
however
gervaise
went
to
pere
colombe
to
find
out
something
about
him
he
had
been
there
another
five
times
they
were
unable
to
tell
her
anything
more
all
she
could
do
was
to
take
away
his
tools
which
he
had
left
under
a
seat
in
the
evening
lantier
seeing
that
the
laundress
seemed
very
worried
offered
to
take
her
to
a
just
by
way
of
passing
a
pleasant
hour
or
two
she
refused
at
first
she
was
in
no
mood
for
laughing
otherwise
she
would
not
have
said
no
for
the
hatter
made
the
proposal
in
too
straightforward
a
manner
for
her
to
feel
any
mistrust
he
seemed
to
feel
for
her
in
quite
a
paternal
way
never
before
had
coupeau
slept
out
two
nights
running
so
that
in
spite
of
herself
she
would
go
every
ten
minutes
to
the
door
with
her
iron
in
her
hand
and
look
up
and
down
the
street
to
see
if
her
old
man
was
coming
it
might
be
that
coupeau
had
broken
a
leg
or
fallen
under
a
wagon
and
been
crushed
and
that
might
be
good
riddance
to
bad
rubbish
she
saw
no
reason
for
cherishing
in
her
heart
any
affection
for
a
filthy
character
like
him
but
it
was
irritating
all
the
same
to
have
to
wonder
every
night
whether
he
would
come
in
or
not
when
it
got
dark
lantier
again
suggested
the
and
this
time
she
accepted
she
decided
it
would
be
silly
to
deny
herself
a
little
pleasure
when
her
husband
had
been
out
on
the
town
for
three
days
if
he
was
coming
in
then
she
might
as
well
go
out
herself
let
the
entire
dump
burn
up
if
it
felt
like
it
she
might
even
put
a
torch
to
it
herself
she
was
getting
tired
of
the
boring
monotony
of
her
present
life
they
ate
their
dinner
quickly
then
when
she
went
off
at
eight
with
the
hatter
gervaise
told
mother
coupeau
and
nana
to
go
to
bed
at
once
the
shop
was
shut
and
the
shutters
up
she
left
by
the
door
opening
into
the
courtyard
and
gave
madame
boche
the
key
asking
her
if
her
pig
of
a
husband
came
home
to
have
the
kindness
to
put
him
to
bed
the
hatter
was
waiting
for
her
under
the
big
doorway
arrayed
in
his
best
and
whistling
a
tune
she
had
on
her
silk
dress
they
walked
slowly
along
the
pavement
keeping
close
to
each
other
lighted
up
by
the
glare
from
the
shop
windows
which
showed
them
smiling
and
talking
together
in
low
voices
the
was
in
the
boulevard
de
rochechouart
it
had
originally
been
a
little
cafe
and
had
been
enlarged
by
means
of
a
kind
of
wooden
shed
erected
in
the
courtyard
at
the
door
a
string
of
glass
globes
formed
a
luminous
porch
tall
posters
pasted
on
boards
stood
upon
the
ground
close
to
the
gutter
here
we
are
said
lantier
first
appearance
of
mademoiselle
amanda
then
he
caught
sight
of
who
was
also
reading
the
poster
bibi
had
a
black
eye
some
punch
he
had
run
up
against
the
day
before
well
where
coupeau
inquired
the
hatter
looking
about
have
you
then
lost
coupeau
oh
long
ago
since
yesterday
replied
the
other
there
was
a
bit
of
a
on
leaving
mother
baquet
i
do
care
for
fisticuffs
we
had
a
row
you
know
with
mother
baquet
because
he
wanted
to
make
us
pay
for
a
quart
twice
over
then
i
left
i
went
and
had
a
bit
of
a
snooze
he
was
still
yawning
he
had
slept
eighteen
hours
at
a
stretch
he
was
moreover
quite
sobered
with
a
stupid
look
on
his
face
and
his
jacket
smothered
with
fluff
for
he
had
no
doubt
tumbled
into
bed
with
his
clothes
on
and
you
do
know
where
my
husband
is
sir
asked
the
laundress
well
no
not
a
bit
it
was
five
when
we
left
mother
baquet
that
all
i
know
about
it
perhaps
he
went
down
the
street
yes
i
fancy
now
that
i
saw
him
go
to
the
with
a
coachman
oh
how
stupid
it
is
really
we
deserve
to
be
shot
lantier
and
gervaise
spent
a
very
pleasant
evening
at
the
at
eleven
when
the
place
closed
they
strolled
home
without
hurrying
themselves
the
cold
was
quite
sharp
people
seemed
to
be
in
groups
some
of
the
girls
were
giggling
in
the
darkness
as
their
men
pressed
close
to
them
lantier
was
humming
one
of
mademoiselle
songs
gervaise
with
her
head
spinning
from
too
much
drink
hummed
the
refrain
with
him
it
had
been
very
warm
at
the
and
the
two
drinks
she
had
had
along
with
all
the
smoke
had
upset
her
stomach
a
bit
she
had
been
quite
impressed
with
mademoiselle
amanda
she
dare
to
appear
in
public
wearing
so
little
but
she
had
to
admit
that
the
lady
had
lovely
skin
everyone
asleep
said
gervaise
after
ringing
three
times
without
the
boches
opening
the
door
at
length
the
door
opened
but
inside
the
porch
it
was
very
dark
and
when
she
knocked
at
the
window
of
the
concierge
room
to
ask
for
her
key
the
concierge
who
was
half
asleep
pulled
out
some
rigmarole
which
she
could
make
nothing
of
at
first
she
eventually
understood
that
poisson
the
policeman
had
brought
coupeau
home
in
a
frightful
state
and
that
the
key
was
no
doubt
in
the
lock
the
deuce
murmured
lantier
when
they
had
entered
whatever
has
he
been
up
to
here
the
stench
is
abominable
there
was
indeed
a
most
powerful
stench
as
gervaise
went
to
look
for
matches
she
stepped
into
something
messy
after
she
succeeded
in
lighting
a
candle
a
pretty
sight
met
their
eyes
coupeau
appeared
to
have
disgorged
his
very
insides
the
bed
was
splattered
all
over
so
was
the
carpet
and
even
the
bureau
had
splashes
on
its
sides
besides
that
he
had
fallen
from
the
bed
where
poisson
had
probably
thrown
him
and
was
snoring
on
the
floor
in
the
midst
of
the
filth
like
a
pig
wallowing
in
the
mire
exhaling
his
foul
breath
through
his
open
mouth
his
grey
hair
was
straggling
into
the
puddle
around
his
head
oh
the
pig
the
pig
repeated
gervaise
indignant
and
exasperated
he
dirtied
everything
no
a
dog
would
have
done
that
even
a
dead
dog
is
cleaner
they
both
hesitated
to
move
not
knowing
where
to
place
their
feet
coupeau
had
never
before
come
home
and
put
the
bedroom
into
such
a
shocking
state
this
sight
was
a
blow
to
whatever
affection
his
wife
still
had
for
him
previously
she
had
been
forgiving
and
not
seriously
offended
even
when
he
had
been
blind
drunk
but
this
made
her
sick
it
was
too
much
she
would
have
touched
coupeau
for
the
world
and
just
the
thought
of
this
filthy
bum
touching
her
caused
a
repugnance
such
as
she
might
have
felt
had
she
been
required
to
sleep
beside
the
corpse
of
someone
who
had
died
from
a
terrible
disease
oh
i
must
get
into
that
bed
murmured
she
i
ca
go
and
sleep
in
the
street
oh
i
crawl
into
it
foot
first
she
tried
to
step
over
the
drunkard
but
had
to
catch
hold
of
a
corner
of
the
chest
of
drawers
to
save
herself
from
slipping
in
the
mess
coupeau
completely
blocked
the
way
to
the
bed
then
lantier
who
laughed
to
himself
on
seeing
that
she
certainly
could
not
sleep
on
her
own
pillow
that
night
took
hold
of
her
hand
saying
in
a
low
and
angry
voice
gervaise
he
is
a
pig
she
understood
what
he
meant
and
pulled
her
hand
free
she
sighed
to
herself
and
in
her
bewilderment
addressed
him
familiarly
as
in
the
old
days
no
leave
me
alone
auguste
go
to
your
own
bed
i
manage
somehow
to
lie
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
come
gervaise
do
be
foolish
resumed
he
it
too
abominable
you
ca
remain
here
come
with
me
he
wo
hear
us
what
are
you
afraid
of
no
she
replied
firmly
shaking
her
head
vigorously
then
to
show
that
she
would
remain
where
she
was
she
began
to
take
off
her
clothes
throwing
her
silk
dress
over
a
chair
she
was
quickly
in
only
her
chemise
and
petticoat
well
it
was
her
own
bed
she
wanted
to
sleep
in
her
own
bed
and
made
two
more
attempts
to
reach
a
clean
corner
of
the
bed
lantier
having
no
intention
of
giving
up
whispered
things
to
her
what
a
predicament
she
was
in
with
a
louse
of
a
husband
that
prevented
her
from
crawling
under
her
own
blankets
and
a
low
skunk
behind
her
just
waiting
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
to
possess
her
again
she
begged
lantier
to
be
quiet
turning
toward
the
small
room
where
nana
and
mother
coupeau
slept
she
listened
anxiously
she
could
hear
only
steady
breathing
leave
me
alone
auguste
she
repeated
you
wake
them
be
sensible
lantier
did
answer
but
just
smiled
at
her
then
he
began
to
kiss
her
on
the
ear
just
as
in
the
old
days
gervaise
felt
like
sobbing
her
strength
deserted
her
she
felt
a
great
buzzing
in
her
ears
a
violent
tremor
passed
through
her
she
advanced
another
step
forward
and
she
was
again
obliged
to
draw
back
it
was
not
possible
the
disgust
was
too
great
she
felt
on
the
verge
of
vomiting
herself
coupeau
overpowered
by
intoxication
lying
as
comfortably
as
though
on
a
bed
of
down
was
sleeping
off
his
booze
without
life
in
his
limbs
and
with
his
mouth
all
on
one
side
the
whole
street
might
have
entered
and
laughed
at
him
without
a
hair
of
his
body
moving
well
i
ca
help
it
she
faltered
it
his
own
fault
dieu
he
forcing
me
out
of
my
own
bed
i
no
bed
any
longer
no
i
help
it
it
his
own
fault
she
was
trembling
so
she
scarcely
knew
what
she
was
doing
while
lantier
was
urging
her
into
his
room
nana
face
appeared
at
one
of
the
glass
panes
in
the
door
of
the
little
room
the
young
girl
pale
from
sleep
had
awakened
and
gotten
out
of
bed
quietly
she
stared
at
her
father
lying
in
his
vomit
then
she
stood
watching
until
her
mother
disappeared
into
lantier
room
she
watched
with
the
intensity
and
the
eyes
of
a
vicious
child
aflame
with
curiosity
chapter
ix
that
winter
mother
coupeau
nearly
went
off
in
one
of
her
coughing
fits
each
december
she
could
count
on
her
asthma
keeping
her
on
her
back
for
two
and
three
weeks
at
a
time
she
was
no
longer
fifteen
she
would
be
on
day
with
that
she
was
very
rickety
getting
a
rattling
in
her
throat
for
nothing
at
all
though
she
was
plump
and
stout
the
doctor
said
she
would
go
off
coughing
just
time
enough
to
say
the
candle
out
when
she
was
in
her
bed
mother
coupeau
became
positively
unbearable
it
is
true
though
that
the
little
room
in
which
she
slept
with
nana
was
not
at
all
gay
there
was
barely
room
for
two
chairs
between
the
beds
the
wallpaper
a
faded
gray
hung
loose
in
long
strips
the
small
window
near
the
ceiling
let
in
only
a
dim
light
it
was
like
a
cavern
at
night
as
she
lay
awake
she
could
listen
to
the
breathing
of
the
sleeping
nana
as
a
sort
of
distraction
but
in
the
as
there
was
no
one
to
keep
her
company
from
morning
to
night
she
grumbled
and
cried
and
repeated
to
herself
for
hours
together
as
she
rolled
her
head
on
the
pillow
good
heavens
what
a
miserable
creature
i
am
good
heavens
what
a
miserable
creature
i
am
they
leave
me
to
die
in
prison
yes
in
prison
as
soon
as
anyone
called
virginie
or
madame
boche
to
ask
after
her
health
she
would
not
reply
directly
but
immediately
started
on
her
list
of
complaints
oh
i
pay
dearly
for
the
food
i
eat
here
i
be
much
better
off
with
strangers
i
asked
for
a
cup
of
tisane
and
they
brought
me
an
entire
pot
of
hot
water
it
was
a
way
of
saying
that
i
drank
too
much
i
brought
nana
up
myself
and
she
scurries
away
in
her
bare
feet
every
morning
and
i
never
see
her
again
all
day
then
at
night
she
sleeps
so
soundly
that
she
never
wakes
up
to
ask
me
if
i
in
pain
i
just
a
nuisance
to
them
they
waiting
for
me
to
die
that
will
happen
soon
enough
i
do
even
have
a
son
any
more
that
laundress
has
taken
him
from
me
she
beat
me
to
death
if
she
was
afraid
of
the
law
gervaise
was
indeed
rather
hasty
at
times
the
place
was
going
to
the
dogs
everyone
temper
was
getting
spoilt
and
they
sent
each
other
to
the
right
about
for
the
least
word
coupeau
one
morning
that
he
had
a
hangover
exclaimed
the
old
thing
always
saying
she
going
to
die
and
yet
she
never
does
the
words
struck
mother
coupeau
to
the
heart
they
frequently
complained
of
how
much
she
cost
them
observing
that
they
would
save
a
lot
of
money
when
she
was
gone
when
at
her
worst
that
winter
one
afternoon
when
madame
lorilleux
and
madame
lerat
had
met
at
her
bedside
mother
coupeau
winked
her
eye
as
a
signal
to
them
to
lean
over
her
she
could
scarcely
speak
she
rather
hissed
than
said
in
a
low
voice
it
becoming
indecent
i
heard
them
last
night
yes
and
the
hatter
and
they
were
kicking
up
such
a
row
together
coupeau
too
decent
for
her
and
she
related
in
short
sentences
coughing
and
choking
between
each
that
her
son
had
come
home
dead
drunk
the
night
before
then
as
she
was
not
asleep
she
was
easily
able
to
account
for
all
the
noises
of
bare
feet
tripping
over
the
tiled
floor
the
hissing
voice
of
the
hatter
calling
her
the
door
between
the
two
rooms
gently
closed
and
the
rest
it
must
have
lasted
till
daylight
she
could
not
tell
the
exact
time
because
in
spite
of
her
efforts
she
had
ended
by
falling
into
a
dose
what
most
disgusting
is
that
nana
might
have
heard
everything
continued
she
she
was
indeed
restless
all
the
night
she
who
usually
sleeps
so
sound
she
tossed
about
and
kept
turning
over
as
though
there
had
been
some
lighted
charcoal
in
her
bed
the
other
two
women
did
not
seem
at
all
surprised
of
course
murmured
madame
lorilleux
it
probably
began
the
very
first
night
but
as
it
pleases
coupeau
we
no
business
to
interfere
all
the
same
it
not
very
respectable
as
for
me
declared
madame
lerat
through
clenched
teeth
if
i
been
there
i
have
thrown
a
fright
into
them
i
have
shouted
something
anything
a
doctor
maid
told
me
once
that
the
doctor
had
told
her
that
a
surprise
like
that
at
a
certain
moment
could
strike
a
woman
dead
if
she
had
died
right
there
that
would
have
been
well
would
it
she
would
have
been
punished
right
where
she
had
sinned
it
was
long
until
the
entire
neighborhood
knew
that
gervaise
visited
lantier
room
every
night
madame
lorilleux
was
loudly
indignant
calling
her
brother
a
poor
fool
whose
wife
had
shamed
him
and
her
poor
mother
forced
to
live
in
the
midst
of
such
horrors
as
a
result
the
neighbors
blamed
gervaise
yes
she
must
have
led
lantier
astray
you
could
see
it
in
her
eyes
in
spite
of
the
nasty
gossip
lantier
was
still
liked
because
he
was
always
so
polite
he
always
had
candy
or
flowers
to
give
the
ladies
dieu
men
should
be
expected
to
push
away
women
who
threw
themselves
at
them
there
was
no
excuse
for
gervaise
she
was
a
disgrace
the
lorilleuxs
used
to
bring
nana
up
to
their
apartment
in
order
to
find
out
more
details
from
her
their
godchild
but
nana
would
put
on
her
expression
of
innocent
stupidity
and
lower
her
long
silky
eyelashes
to
hide
the
fire
in
her
eyes
as
she
replied
in
the
midst
of
this
general
indignation
gervaise
lived
quietly
on
feeling
tired
out
and
half
asleep
at
first
she
considered
herself
very
sinful
and
felt
a
disgust
for
herself
when
she
left
lantier
room
she
would
wash
her
hands
and
scrub
herself
as
if
trying
to
get
rid
of
an
evil
stain
if
coupeau
then
tried
to
joke
with
her
she
would
fly
into
a
passion
and
run
and
shiveringly
dress
herself
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
shop
neither
would
she
allow
lantier
near
her
soon
after
her
husband
had
kissed
her
she
would
have
liked
to
have
changed
her
skin
as
she
changed
men
but
she
gradually
became
accustomed
to
it
soon
it
was
too
much
trouble
to
scrub
herself
each
time
her
thirst
for
happiness
led
her
to
enjoy
as
much
as
she
could
the
difficult
situation
she
had
always
been
disposed
to
make
allowances
for
herself
so
why
not
for
others
she
only
wanted
to
avoid
causing
trouble
as
long
as
the
household
went
along
as
usual
there
was
nothing
to
complain
about
then
after
all
she
could
not
be
doing
anything
to
make
coupeau
stop
drinking
matters
were
arranged
so
easily
to
the
general
satisfaction
one
is
generally
punished
if
one
does
what
is
not
right
his
dissoluteness
had
gradually
become
a
habit
now
it
was
as
regular
an
affair
as
eating
and
drinking
each
time
coupeau
came
home
drunk
she
would
go
to
lantier
room
this
was
usually
on
mondays
tuesdays
and
wednesdays
sometimes
on
other
nights
if
coupeau
was
snoring
too
loudly
she
would
leave
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
was
not
that
she
cared
more
for
lantier
but
just
that
she
slept
better
in
his
room
mother
coupeau
never
dared
speak
openly
of
it
but
after
a
quarrel
when
the
laundress
had
bullied
her
the
old
woman
was
not
sparing
in
her
allusions
she
would
say
that
she
knew
men
who
were
precious
fools
and
women
who
were
precious
hussies
and
she
would
mutter
words
far
more
biting
with
the
sharpness
of
language
pertaining
to
an
old
the
first
time
this
had
occurred
gervaise
looked
at
her
straight
in
the
face
without
answering
then
also
avoiding
going
into
details
she
began
to
defend
herself
with
reasons
given
in
a
general
sort
of
way
when
a
woman
had
a
drunkard
for
a
husband
a
pig
who
lived
in
filth
that
woman
was
to
be
excused
if
she
sought
for
cleanliness
elsewhere
once
she
pointed
out
that
lantier
was
just
as
much
her
husband
as
coupeau
was
had
she
known
him
since
she
was
fourteen
and
did
she
have
children
by
him
anyway
she
like
to
see
anyone
make
trouble
for
her
she
the
only
one
around
the
rue
de
la
madame
vigouroux
the
had
a
merry
dance
from
morning
to
night
then
there
was
the
grocer
wife
madame
lehongre
with
her
dieu
what
a
slob
of
a
fellow
he
was
worth
touching
with
a
shovel
even
the
neat
little
clockmaker
was
said
to
have
carried
on
with
his
own
daughter
a
streetwalker
ah
the
entire
neighborhood
oh
she
knew
plenty
of
dirt
one
day
when
mother
coupeau
was
more
pointed
than
usual
in
her
observations
gervaise
had
replied
to
her
clinching
her
teeth
you
confined
to
your
bed
and
you
take
advantage
of
it
listen
you
wrong
you
see
that
i
behave
nicely
to
you
for
i
never
thrown
your
past
life
into
your
teeth
oh
i
know
all
about
it
no
cough
i
finished
what
i
had
to
say
it
only
to
request
you
to
mind
your
own
business
that
all
the
old
woman
almost
choked
on
the
morrow
goujet
having
called
about
his
mother
washing
when
gervaise
happened
to
be
out
mother
coupeau
called
him
to
her
and
kept
him
some
time
seated
beside
her
bed
she
knew
all
about
the
blacksmith
friendship
and
had
noticed
that
for
some
time
past
he
had
looked
dismal
and
wretched
from
a
suspicion
of
the
melancholy
things
that
were
taking
place
so
for
the
sake
of
gossiping
and
out
of
revenge
for
the
quarrel
of
the
day
before
she
bluntly
told
him
the
truth
weeping
and
complaining
as
though
gervaise
wicked
behavior
did
her
some
special
injury
when
goujet
quitted
the
little
room
he
leant
against
the
wall
almost
stifling
with
grief
then
when
the
laundress
returned
home
mother
coupeau
called
to
her
that
madame
goujet
required
her
to
go
round
with
her
clothes
ironed
or
not
and
she
was
so
animated
that
gervaise
seeing
something
was
wrong
guessed
what
had
taken
place
and
had
a
presentiment
of
the
unpleasantness
which
awaited
her
very
pale
her
limbs
already
trembling
she
placed
the
things
in
a
basket
and
started
off
for
years
past
she
had
not
returned
the
goujets
a
sou
of
their
money
the
debt
still
amounted
to
four
hundred
and
francs
she
always
spoke
of
her
embarrassments
and
received
the
money
for
the
washing
it
filled
her
with
shame
because
she
seemed
to
be
taking
advantage
of
the
blacksmith
friendship
to
make
a
fool
of
him
coupeau
who
had
now
become
less
scrupulous
would
chuckle
and
say
that
goujet
no
doubt
had
fooled
around
with
her
a
bit
and
had
so
paid
himself
but
she
in
spite
of
the
relations
she
had
fallen
into
with
coupeau
would
indignantly
ask
her
husband
if
he
already
wished
to
eat
of
that
sort
of
bread
she
would
not
allow
anyone
to
say
a
word
against
goujet
in
her
presence
her
affection
for
the
blacksmith
remained
like
a
last
shred
of
her
honor
thus
every
time
she
took
the
washing
home
to
those
worthy
people
she
felt
a
spasm
of
her
heart
the
moment
she
put
a
foot
on
their
stairs
ah
it
you
at
last
said
madame
goujet
sharply
on
opening
the
door
to
her
when
i
in
want
of
death
i
send
you
to
fetch
him
gervaise
entered
greatly
embarrassed
not
even
daring
to
mutter
an
excuse
she
was
no
longer
punctual
never
came
at
the
time
arranged
and
would
keep
her
customers
waiting
for
days
on
end
little
by
little
she
was
giving
way
to
a
system
of
thorough
disorder
for
a
week
past
i
been
expecting
you
continued
the
and
you
tell
falsehoods
too
you
send
your
apprentice
to
me
with
all
sorts
of
stories
you
are
then
busy
with
my
things
you
will
deliver
them
the
same
evening
or
else
you
had
an
accident
the
fallen
into
a
pail
of
water
whilst
all
this
is
going
on
i
waste
my
time
nothing
turns
up
and
it
worries
me
exceedingly
no
you
most
unreasonable
come
what
have
you
in
your
basket
is
everything
there
now
have
you
brought
me
the
pair
of
sheets
you
been
keeping
back
for
a
month
past
and
the
chemise
which
was
missing
the
last
time
you
brought
home
the
washing
yes
yes
murmured
gervaise
i
have
the
chemise
here
it
is
but
madame
goujet
cried
out
that
chemise
was
not
hers
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
her
things
were
changed
now
it
was
too
bad
only
the
week
before
there
were
two
handkerchiefs
which
had
her
mark
on
them
it
was
not
to
her
taste
to
have
clothes
coming
from
no
one
knew
where
besides
that
she
liked
to
have
her
own
things
and
the
sheets
she
resumed
they
lost
are
they
well
woman
you
must
see
about
them
for
i
insist
upon
having
them
morning
do
you
hear
there
was
a
silence
which
particularly
bothered
gervaise
when
she
noticed
that
the
door
to
goujet
room
was
open
if
he
was
in
there
it
was
most
annoying
that
he
should
hear
these
just
criticisms
she
made
no
reply
meekly
bowing
her
head
and
placing
the
laundry
on
the
bed
as
quickly
as
possible
matters
became
worse
when
madame
goujet
began
to
look
over
the
things
one
by
one
she
took
hold
of
them
and
threw
them
down
again
saying
ah
you
do
get
them
up
nearly
so
well
as
you
used
to
do
one
ca
compliment
you
every
day
now
yes
you
taken
to
mucking
your
work
doing
it
in
a
most
slovenly
way
just
look
at
this
it
scorched
there
the
mark
of
the
iron
on
the
plaits
and
the
buttons
have
all
been
torn
off
i
do
know
how
you
manage
it
but
there
never
a
button
left
on
anything
oh
now
here
a
petticoat
body
which
i
shall
certainly
not
pay
you
for
look
there
the
still
on
it
you
simply
smoothed
it
over
so
now
the
things
are
not
even
clean
she
stopped
whilst
she
counted
the
different
articles
then
she
exclaimed
what
this
is
all
you
brought
there
are
two
pairs
of
stockings
six
towels
a
and
several
short
you
regularly
trifling
with
me
it
seems
i
sent
word
that
you
were
to
bring
me
everything
ironed
or
not
if
your
apprentice
is
here
on
the
hour
with
the
rest
of
the
things
we
shall
fall
out
madame
coupeau
i
warn
you
at
this
moment
goujet
coughed
in
his
room
gervaise
slightly
started
dieu
how
she
was
treated
before
him
and
she
remained
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
rooms
embarrassed
and
confused
and
waiting
for
the
dirty
clothes
but
after
making
up
the
account
madame
goujet
had
quietly
returned
to
her
seat
near
the
window
and
resumed
the
mending
of
a
lace
shawl
and
the
dirty
things
timidly
inquired
the
laundress
no
thank
you
replied
the
old
woman
there
will
be
no
laundry
this
week
gervaise
turned
pale
she
was
no
longer
to
have
the
washing
then
she
quite
lost
her
head
she
was
obliged
to
sit
down
on
a
chair
for
her
legs
were
giving
way
under
her
she
did
not
attempt
to
vindicate
herself
all
that
she
would
find
to
say
was
is
monsieur
goujet
ill
yes
he
was
not
well
he
had
been
obliged
to
come
home
instead
of
returning
to
the
forge
and
he
had
gone
to
lie
down
on
his
bed
to
get
a
rest
madame
goujet
talked
gravely
wearing
her
black
dress
as
usual
and
her
white
face
framed
in
her
coif
the
pay
at
the
forge
had
been
cut
again
it
was
now
only
seven
francs
a
day
because
the
machines
did
so
much
of
the
work
this
forced
her
to
save
money
every
way
she
could
she
would
do
her
own
washing
from
now
on
it
would
naturally
have
been
very
helpful
if
the
coupeaus
had
been
able
to
return
her
the
money
lent
them
by
her
son
but
she
was
not
going
to
set
the
lawyers
on
them
as
they
were
unable
to
pay
as
she
was
talking
about
the
debt
gervaise
lowered
her
eyes
in
embarrassment
all
the
same
continued
the
by
pinching
yourselves
a
little
you
could
manage
to
pay
it
off
for
really
now
you
live
very
well
and
spend
a
great
deal
i
sure
if
you
were
only
to
pay
off
ten
francs
a
month
she
was
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
goujet
voice
as
he
called
mamma
mamma
and
when
she
returned
to
her
seat
which
was
almost
immediately
she
changed
the
conversation
the
blacksmith
had
doubtless
begged
her
not
to
ask
gervaise
for
money
but
in
spite
of
herself
she
again
spoke
of
the
debt
at
the
expiration
of
five
minutes
oh
she
had
foreseen
long
ago
what
was
now
happening
coupeau
was
drinking
all
that
the
laundry
business
brought
in
and
dragging
his
wife
down
with
him
her
son
would
never
have
loaned
the
money
if
he
had
only
listened
to
her
by
now
he
would
have
been
married
instead
of
miserably
sad
with
only
unhappiness
to
look
forward
to
for
the
rest
of
his
life
she
grew
quite
stern
and
angry
even
accusing
gervaise
of
having
schemed
with
coupeau
to
take
advantage
of
her
foolish
son
yes
some
women
were
able
to
play
the
hypocrite
for
years
but
eventually
the
truth
came
out
mamma
mamma
again
called
goujet
but
louder
this
time
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
when
she
returned
she
said
as
she
resumed
her
lace
mending
go
in
he
wishes
to
see
you
gervaise
all
in
a
tremble
left
the
door
open
this
scene
filled
her
with
emotion
because
it
was
like
an
avowal
of
their
affection
before
madame
goujet
she
again
beheld
the
quiet
little
chamber
with
its
narrow
iron
bedstead
and
papered
all
over
with
pictures
the
whole
looking
like
the
room
of
some
girl
of
fifteen
goujet
big
body
was
stretched
on
the
bed
mother
coupeau
disclosures
and
the
things
his
mother
had
been
saying
seemed
to
have
knocked
all
the
life
out
of
his
limbs
his
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
his
beautiful
yellow
beard
was
still
wet
in
the
first
moment
of
rage
he
must
have
punched
away
at
his
pillow
with
his
terrible
fists
for
the
ticking
was
split
and
the
feathers
were
coming
out
listen
mamma
wrong
said
he
to
the
laundress
in
a
voice
that
was
scarcely
audible
you
owe
me
nothing
i
wo
have
it
mentioned
again
he
had
raised
himself
up
and
was
looking
at
her
big
tears
at
once
filled
his
eyes
do
you
suffer
monsieur
goujet
murmured
she
what
is
the
matter
with
you
tell
me
nothing
thanks
i
tired
myself
with
too
much
work
yesterday
i
will
rest
a
bit
then
his
heart
breaking
he
could
not
restrain
himself
and
burst
out
dieu
ah
dieu
it
was
never
to
be
never
you
swore
it
and
now
it
is
it
is
ah
it
pains
me
too
much
leave
me
and
with
his
hand
he
gently
and
imploringly
motioned
to
her
to
go
she
did
not
draw
nearer
to
the
bed
she
went
off
as
he
requested
her
to
feeling
stupid
unable
to
say
anything
to
soothe
him
when
in
the
other
room
she
took
up
her
basket
but
she
did
not
go
home
she
stood
there
trying
to
find
something
to
say
madame
goujet
continued
her
mending
without
raising
her
head
it
was
she
who
at
length
said
well
send
me
back
my
things
and
we
will
settle
up
afterwards
yes
it
will
be
best
so
stammered
gervaise
she
took
a
last
look
around
the
neatly
arranged
room
and
thought
as
she
shut
the
door
that
she
seemed
to
be
leaving
some
part
of
her
better
self
behind
she
plodded
blindly
back
to
the
laundry
scarcely
knowing
where
she
was
going
when
gervaise
arrived
she
found
mother
coupeau
out
of
her
bed
sitting
on
a
chair
by
the
stove
gervaise
was
too
tired
to
scold
her
her
bones
ached
as
though
she
had
been
beaten
and
she
was
thinking
that
her
life
was
becoming
too
hard
to
bear
surely
a
quick
death
was
the
only
escape
from
the
pain
in
her
heart
after
this
gervaise
became
indifferent
to
everything
with
a
vague
gesture
of
her
hand
she
would
send
everybody
about
their
business
at
each
fresh
worry
she
buried
herself
deeper
in
her
only
pleasure
which
was
to
have
her
three
meals
a
day
the
shop
might
have
collapsed
so
long
as
she
was
not
beneath
it
she
would
have
gone
off
willingly
without
a
chemise
to
her
back
and
the
little
shop
was
collapsing
not
suddenly
but
little
by
little
morning
and
evening
one
by
one
the
customers
got
angry
and
sent
their
washing
elsewhere
monsieur
madinier
mademoiselle
remanjou
the
boches
themselves
had
returned
to
madame
fauconnier
where
they
could
count
on
great
punctuality
one
ends
by
getting
tired
of
asking
for
a
pair
of
stockings
for
three
weeks
straight
and
of
putting
on
shirts
with
grease
stains
dating
from
the
previous
sunday
gervaise
without
losing
a
bite
wished
them
a
pleasant
journey
and
spoke
her
mind
about
them
saying
that
she
was
precious
glad
she
would
no
longer
have
to
poke
her
nose
into
their
filth
the
entire
neighborhood
could
quit
her
that
would
relieve
her
of
the
piles
of
stinking
junk
and
give
her
less
work
to
do
now
her
only
customers
were
those
who
did
pay
regularly
the
and
women
like
madame
gaudron
whose
laundry
smelled
so
bad
that
not
one
of
the
laundresses
on
the
rue
neuve
would
take
it
she
had
to
let
madame
putois
go
leaving
only
her
apprentice
augustine
who
seemed
to
grow
more
stupid
as
time
passed
frequently
there
was
not
even
enough
work
for
the
two
of
them
and
they
sat
on
stools
all
afternoon
doing
nothing
whilst
idleness
and
poverty
entered
dirtiness
naturally
entered
also
one
would
never
have
recognised
that
beautiful
blue
shop
the
color
of
heaven
which
had
once
been
gervaise
pride
its
and
panes
which
were
never
washed
were
covered
from
top
to
bottom
with
the
splashes
of
the
passing
vehicles
on
the
brass
rods
in
the
windows
were
displayed
three
grey
rags
left
by
customers
who
had
died
in
the
hospital
and
inside
it
was
more
pitiable
still
the
dampness
of
the
clothes
hung
up
at
the
ceiling
to
dry
had
loosed
all
the
wallpaper
the
pompadour
chintz
hung
in
strips
like
cobwebs
covered
with
dust
the
big
stove
broken
and
in
holes
from
the
rough
use
of
the
poker
looked
in
its
corner
like
the
stock
in
trade
of
a
dealer
in
old
iron
the
appeared
as
though
it
had
been
used
by
a
regiment
covered
as
it
was
with
wine
and
coffee
stains
sticky
with
jam
greasy
from
spilled
gravy
gervaise
was
so
at
ease
among
it
all
that
she
never
even
noticed
the
shop
was
getting
filthy
she
became
used
to
it
all
just
as
she
got
used
to
wearing
torn
skirts
and
no
longer
washing
herself
carefully
the
disorder
was
like
a
warm
nest
her
own
ease
was
her
sole
consideration
she
did
not
care
a
pin
for
anything
else
the
debts
though
still
increasing
no
longer
troubled
her
her
honesty
gradually
deserted
her
whether
she
would
be
able
to
pay
or
not
was
altogether
uncertain
and
she
preferred
not
to
think
about
it
when
her
credit
was
stopped
at
one
shop
she
would
open
an
account
at
some
other
shop
close
by
she
was
in
debt
all
over
the
neighborhood
she
owed
money
every
few
yards
to
take
merely
the
rue
de
la
she
no
longer
dared
pass
in
front
of
the
grocer
nor
the
nor
the
greengrocer
and
this
obliged
her
whenever
she
required
to
be
at
the
to
go
round
by
the
rue
des
poissonniers
which
was
quite
ten
minutes
out
of
her
way
the
tradespeople
came
and
treated
her
as
a
swindler
one
evening
the
dealer
from
whom
she
had
purchased
lantier
furniture
made
a
scene
in
the
street
scenes
like
this
upset
her
at
the
time
but
were
soon
forgotten
and
never
spoiled
her
appetite
what
a
nerve
to
bother
her
like
that
when
she
had
no
money
to
pay
they
were
all
robbers
anyway
and
it
served
them
right
to
have
to
wait
well
she
have
to
go
bankrupt
but
she
did
intend
to
fret
about
it
now
meanwhile
mother
coupeau
had
recovered
for
another
year
the
household
jogged
along
during
the
summer
months
there
was
naturally
a
little
more
work
the
white
petticoats
and
the
cambric
dresses
of
the
of
the
exterior
boulevard
the
catastrophe
was
slowly
approaching
the
home
sank
deeper
into
the
mire
every
week
there
were
ups
and
downs
however
days
when
one
had
to
rub
one
stomach
before
the
empty
cupboard
and
others
when
one
ate
veal
enough
to
make
one
burst
mother
coupeau
was
for
ever
being
seen
in
the
street
hiding
bundles
under
her
apron
and
strolling
in
the
direction
of
the
in
the
rue
polonceau
she
strutted
along
with
the
air
of
a
devotee
going
to
mass
for
she
did
not
dislike
these
errands
haggling
about
money
amused
her
this
crying
up
of
her
wares
like
a
dealer
tickled
the
old
woman
fancy
for
driving
hard
bargains
the
clerks
knew
her
well
and
called
her
mamma
four
francs
because
she
always
demanded
four
francs
when
they
offered
three
on
bundles
no
bigger
than
two
sous
worth
of
butter
at
the
start
gervaise
took
advantage
of
good
weeks
to
get
things
back
from
the
only
to
put
them
back
again
the
next
week
later
she
let
things
go
altogether
selling
her
pawn
tickets
for
cash
one
thing
alone
gave
gervaise
a
pang
it
was
having
to
pawn
her
clock
to
pay
an
acceptance
for
twenty
francs
to
a
bailiff
who
came
to
seize
her
goods
until
then
she
had
sworn
rather
to
die
of
hunger
than
to
part
with
her
clock
when
mother
coupeau
carried
it
away
in
a
little
she
sunk
on
to
a
chair
without
a
particle
of
strength
left
in
her
arms
her
eyes
full
of
tears
as
though
a
fortune
was
being
torn
from
her
but
when
mother
coupeau
reappeared
with
francs
the
unexpected
loan
the
five
francs
profit
consoled
her
she
at
once
sent
the
old
woman
out
again
for
four
sous
worth
of
brandy
in
a
glass
just
to
toast
the
piece
the
two
of
them
would
often
have
a
drop
together
when
they
were
on
good
terms
with
each
other
mother
coupeau
was
very
successful
at
bringing
back
a
full
glass
hidden
in
her
apron
pocket
without
spilling
a
drop
well
the
neighbors
did
need
to
know
did
they
but
the
neighbors
knew
perfectly
well
this
turned
the
neighborhood
even
more
against
gervaise
she
was
devouring
everything
a
few
more
mouthfuls
and
the
place
would
be
swept
clean
in
the
midst
of
this
general
demolishment
coupeau
continued
to
prosper
the
confounded
tippler
was
as
well
as
well
could
be
the
sour
wine
and
the
vitriol
positively
fattened
him
he
ate
a
great
deal
and
laughed
at
that
stick
lorilleux
who
accused
drink
of
killing
people
and
answered
him
by
slapping
himself
on
the
stomach
the
skin
of
which
was
so
stretched
by
the
fat
that
it
resembled
the
skin
of
a
drum
he
would
play
him
a
tune
on
it
the
glutton
vespers
with
rolls
and
beats
loud
enough
to
have
made
a
quack
fortune
lorilleux
annoyed
at
not
having
any
fat
himself
said
that
it
was
soft
and
unhealthy
coupeau
ignored
him
and
went
on
drinking
more
and
more
saying
it
was
for
his
sake
his
hair
was
beginning
to
turn
grey
and
his
face
to
take
on
the
drunkard
hue
of
purplish
wine
he
continued
to
act
like
a
mischievous
child
well
it
was
his
concern
if
there
was
nothing
about
the
place
to
eat
when
he
went
for
weeks
without
work
he
became
even
more
difficult
still
he
was
always
giving
lantier
friendly
slaps
on
the
back
people
swore
he
had
no
suspicion
at
all
surely
something
terrible
would
happen
if
he
ever
found
out
madame
lerat
shook
her
head
at
this
his
sister
said
she
had
known
of
husbands
who
did
mind
at
all
lantier
was
wasting
away
either
he
took
great
care
of
himself
measuring
his
stomach
by
the
of
his
trousers
with
the
constant
dread
of
having
to
loosen
the
buckle
or
draw
it
tighter
for
he
considered
himself
just
right
and
out
of
coquetry
neither
desired
to
grow
fatter
nor
thinner
that
made
him
hard
to
please
in
the
matter
of
food
for
he
regarded
every
dish
from
the
point
of
view
of
keeping
his
waist
as
it
was
even
when
there
was
not
a
sou
in
the
house
he
required
eggs
cutlets
light
and
nourishing
things
since
he
was
sharing
the
lady
of
the
house
he
considered
himself
to
have
a
half
interest
in
everything
and
would
pocket
any
franc
pieces
he
saw
lying
about
he
kept
gervaise
running
here
and
there
and
seemed
more
at
home
than
coupeau
nana
was
his
favorite
because
he
adored
pretty
little
girls
but
he
paid
less
and
less
attention
to
etienne
since
boys
according
to
him
ought
to
know
how
to
take
care
of
themselves
if
anyone
came
to
see
coupeau
while
he
was
out
lantier
in
shirt
sleeves
and
slippers
would
come
out
of
the
back
room
with
the
bored
expression
of
a
husband
who
has
been
disturbed
saying
he
would
answer
for
coupeau
as
it
was
all
the
same
between
these
two
gentlemen
gervaise
had
nothing
to
laugh
about
she
had
nothing
to
complain
of
as
regards
her
health
thank
goodness
she
was
growing
too
fat
but
two
men
to
coddle
was
often
more
than
she
could
manage
ah
dieu
one
husband
is
already
too
much
for
a
woman
the
worst
was
that
they
got
on
very
well
together
the
rogues
they
never
quarreled
they
would
chuckle
in
each
other
faces
as
they
sat
of
an
evening
after
dinner
their
elbows
on
the
table
they
would
rub
up
against
one
another
all
the
day
like
cats
which
seek
and
cultivate
their
pleasure
the
days
when
they
came
home
in
a
rage
it
was
on
her
that
they
vented
it
go
it
hammer
away
at
the
animal
she
had
a
good
back
it
made
them
all
the
better
friends
when
they
yelled
together
and
it
never
did
for
her
to
give
them
in
the
beginning
whenever
one
of
them
yelled
at
her
she
would
appeal
to
the
other
but
this
seldom
worked
coupeau
had
a
foul
mouth
and
called
her
horrible
things
lantier
chose
his
insults
carefully
but
they
often
hurt
her
even
more
but
one
can
get
used
to
anything
soon
their
nasty
remarks
and
all
the
wrongs
done
her
by
these
two
men
slid
off
her
smooth
skin
like
water
off
a
duck
back
it
was
even
easier
to
have
them
angry
because
when
they
were
in
good
moods
they
bothered
her
too
much
never
giving
her
time
to
get
a
bonnet
ironed
yes
coupeau
and
lantier
were
wearing
her
out
the
sure
enough
lacked
education
but
the
hatter
had
too
much
or
at
least
he
had
education
in
the
same
way
that
dirty
people
have
a
white
shirt
with
uncleanliness
underneath
it
one
night
she
dreamt
that
she
was
on
the
edge
of
a
wall
coupeau
was
knocking
her
into
it
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
whilst
lantier
was
tickling
her
in
the
ribs
to
make
her
fall
quicker
well
that
resembled
her
life
it
was
no
surprise
if
she
was
becoming
slipshod
the
neighbors
were
fair
in
blaming
her
for
the
frightful
habits
she
had
fallen
into
sometimes
a
cold
shiver
ran
through
her
but
things
could
have
been
worse
so
she
tried
to
make
the
best
of
it
once
she
had
seen
a
play
in
which
the
wife
detested
her
husband
and
poisoned
him
for
the
sake
of
her
lover
was
it
more
sensible
for
the
three
of
them
to
live
together
in
peace
in
spite
of
her
debts
and
poverty
she
thought
she
was
quite
happy
and
could
live
in
peace
if
only
coupeau
and
lantier
would
stop
yelling
at
her
so
much
towards
the
autumn
unfortunately
things
became
worse
lantier
pretended
he
was
getting
thinner
and
pulled
a
longer
face
over
the
matter
every
day
he
grumbled
at
everything
sniffed
at
the
dishes
of
potatoes
a
mess
he
could
not
eat
he
would
say
without
having
the
colic
the
least
jangling
now
turned
to
quarrels
in
which
they
accused
one
another
of
being
the
cause
of
all
their
troubles
and
it
was
a
devil
of
a
job
to
restore
harmony
before
they
all
retired
for
the
night
lantier
sensed
a
crisis
coming
and
it
exasperated
him
to
realise
that
this
place
was
already
so
thoroughly
cleaned
out
that
he
could
see
the
day
coming
when
he
have
to
take
his
hat
and
seek
elsewhere
for
his
bed
and
board
he
had
become
accustomed
to
this
little
paradise
where
he
was
nicely
treated
by
everybody
he
should
have
blamed
himself
for
eating
himself
out
of
house
and
home
but
instead
he
blamed
the
coupeaus
for
letting
themselves
be
ruined
in
less
than
two
years
he
thought
gervaise
was
too
extravagant
what
was
going
to
happen
to
them
now
one
evening
in
december
they
had
no
dinner
at
all
there
was
not
a
radish
left
lantier
who
was
very
glum
went
out
early
wandering
about
in
search
of
some
other
den
where
the
smell
of
the
kitchen
would
bring
a
smile
to
one
face
he
would
now
remain
for
hours
beside
the
stove
wrapt
in
thought
then
suddenly
he
began
to
evince
a
great
friendship
for
the
poissons
he
no
longer
teased
the
policeman
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
concede
that
the
emperor
might
not
be
such
a
bad
fellow
after
all
he
seemed
to
especially
admire
virginie
no
doubt
he
was
hoping
to
board
with
them
virginie
having
acquainted
him
with
her
desire
to
set
up
in
some
sort
of
business
he
agreed
with
everything
she
said
and
declared
that
her
idea
was
a
most
brilliant
one
she
was
just
the
person
for
trade
tall
engaging
and
active
oh
she
would
make
as
much
as
she
liked
the
capital
had
been
available
for
some
time
thanks
to
an
inheritance
from
an
aunt
lantier
told
her
of
all
the
shopkeepers
who
were
making
fortunes
the
time
was
right
for
it
you
could
sell
anything
these
days
virginie
however
hesitated
she
was
looking
for
a
shop
that
was
to
be
let
she
did
not
wish
to
leave
the
neighborhood
then
lantier
would
take
her
into
corners
and
converse
with
her
in
an
undertone
for
ten
minutes
at
a
time
he
seemed
to
be
urging
her
to
do
something
in
spite
of
herself
and
she
no
longer
said
no
but
appeared
to
authorize
him
to
act
it
was
as
a
secret
between
them
with
winks
and
words
rapidly
exchanged
some
mysterious
understanding
which
betrayed
itself
even
in
their
handshakings
from
this
moment
the
hatter
would
covertly
watch
the
coupeaus
whilst
eating
their
dry
bread
and
becoming
very
talkative
again
would
deafen
them
with
his
continual
jeremiads
all
day
long
gervaise
moved
in
the
midst
of
that
poverty
which
he
so
obligingly
spread
out
dieu
he
was
thinking
of
himself
he
would
go
on
starving
with
his
friends
as
long
as
they
liked
but
look
at
it
with
common
sense
they
owed
at
least
five
hundred
francs
in
the
neighborhood
besides
which
they
were
two
quarters
rent
behind
with
the
rent
which
meant
another
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
the
landlord
monsieur
marescot
even
spoke
of
having
them
evicted
if
they
did
not
pay
him
by
the
first
of
january
finally
the
had
absorbed
everything
one
could
not
have
got
together
three
francs
worth
of
odds
and
ends
the
clearance
had
been
so
complete
the
nails
remained
in
the
walls
and
that
was
all
and
perhaps
there
were
two
pounds
of
them
at
three
sous
the
pound
gervaise
thoroughly
entangled
in
it
all
her
nerves
quite
upset
by
this
calculation
would
fly
into
a
passion
and
bang
her
fists
down
upon
the
table
or
else
she
would
end
by
bursting
into
tears
like
a
fool
one
night
she
exclaimed
i
be
off
i
prefer
to
put
the
key
under
the
door
and
to
sleep
on
the
pavement
rather
than
continue
to
live
in
such
frights
it
would
be
wiser
said
lantier
slyly
to
get
rid
of
the
lease
if
you
could
find
someone
to
take
it
when
you
are
both
decided
to
give
up
the
shop
she
interrupted
him
more
violently
at
once
at
once
ah
it
be
a
good
riddance
then
the
hatter
became
very
practical
on
giving
up
the
lease
one
would
no
doubt
get
the
new
tenant
to
be
responsible
for
the
two
overdue
quarters
and
he
ventured
to
mention
the
poissons
he
reminded
them
that
virginie
was
looking
for
a
shop
theirs
would
perhaps
suit
her
he
remembered
that
he
had
heard
her
say
she
longed
for
one
just
like
it
but
when
virginie
name
was
mentioned
the
laundress
suddenly
regained
her
composure
we
see
how
things
go
along
when
you
angry
you
always
talk
of
quitting
but
it
is
so
easy
when
you
just
stop
to
think
about
it
during
the
following
days
it
was
in
vain
that
lantier
harped
upon
the
subject
gervaise
replied
that
she
had
seen
herself
worse
off
and
had
pulled
through
how
would
she
be
better
off
when
she
no
longer
had
her
shop
that
would
not
put
bread
into
their
mouths
she
would
on
the
contrary
engage
some
fresh
workwomen
and
work
up
a
fresh
connection
lantier
made
the
mistake
of
mentioning
virginie
again
this
stirred
gervaise
into
furious
obstinacy
no
never
she
had
always
had
her
suspicions
of
what
was
in
virginie
heart
virginie
only
wanted
to
humiliate
her
she
would
rather
turn
it
over
to
the
first
woman
to
come
in
from
the
street
than
to
that
hypocrite
who
had
been
waiting
for
years
to
see
her
fail
yes
virginie
still
had
in
mind
that
fight
in
the
well
she
be
wiser
to
forget
about
it
unless
she
wanted
another
one
now
in
the
face
of
this
flow
of
angry
retorts
lantier
began
by
attacking
gervaise
he
called
her
stupid
and
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
abuse
coupeau
accusing
him
of
not
knowing
how
to
make
his
wife
respect
his
friend
then
realising
that
passion
would
compromise
everything
he
swore
that
he
would
never
again
interest
himself
in
the
affairs
of
other
people
for
one
always
got
more
kicks
than
thanks
and
indeed
he
appeared
to
have
given
up
all
idea
of
talking
them
into
parting
with
the
lease
but
he
was
really
watching
for
a
favorable
opportunity
of
broaching
the
subject
again
and
of
bringing
the
laundress
round
to
his
views
january
had
now
arrived
the
weather
was
wretched
both
damp
and
cold
mother
coupeau
who
had
coughed
and
choked
all
through
december
was
obliged
to
take
to
her
bed
after
it
was
her
annuity
which
she
expected
every
winter
this
winter
though
those
around
her
said
she
never
come
out
of
her
bedroom
except
feet
first
indeed
her
gaspings
sounded
like
a
death
rattle
she
was
still
fat
but
one
eye
was
blind
and
one
side
of
her
face
was
twisted
the
doctor
made
one
call
and
did
return
again
they
kept
giving
her
tisanes
and
going
to
check
on
her
every
hour
she
could
no
longer
speak
because
her
breathing
was
so
difficult
one
monday
evening
coupeau
came
home
totally
drunk
ever
since
his
mother
was
in
danger
he
had
lived
in
a
continual
state
of
deep
emotion
when
he
was
in
bed
snoring
soundly
gervaise
walked
about
the
place
for
a
while
she
was
in
the
habit
of
watching
over
mother
coupeau
during
a
part
of
the
night
nana
had
showed
herself
very
brave
always
sleeping
beside
the
old
woman
and
saying
that
if
she
heard
her
dying
she
would
wake
everyone
since
the
invalid
seemed
to
be
sleeping
peacefully
this
night
gervaise
finally
yielded
to
the
appeals
of
lantier
to
come
into
his
room
for
a
little
rest
they
only
kept
a
candle
alight
standing
on
the
ground
behind
the
wardrobe
but
towards
three
gervaise
abruptly
jumped
out
of
bed
shivering
and
oppressed
with
anguish
she
thought
she
had
felt
a
cold
breath
pass
over
her
body
the
morsel
of
candle
had
burnt
out
she
tied
on
her
petticoats
in
the
dark
all
bewildered
and
with
feverish
hands
it
was
not
till
she
got
into
the
little
room
after
knocking
up
against
the
furniture
that
she
was
able
to
light
a
small
lamp
in
the
midst
of
the
oppressive
silence
of
night
the
snores
alone
sounded
as
two
grave
notes
nana
stretched
on
her
back
was
breathing
gently
between
her
pouting
lips
and
gervaise
holding
down
the
lamp
which
caused
big
shadows
to
dance
about
the
room
cast
the
light
on
mother
coupeau
face
and
beheld
it
all
white
the
head
lying
on
the
shoulder
the
eyes
wide
open
mother
coupeau
was
dead
gently
without
uttering
a
cry
icy
cold
yet
prudent
the
laundress
returned
to
lantier
room
he
had
gone
to
sleep
again
she
bent
over
him
and
murmured
listen
it
all
over
she
dead
heavy
with
sleep
only
half
awake
he
grunted
at
first
leave
me
alone
get
into
bed
we
ca
do
her
any
good
if
she
dead
then
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
asked
what
the
time
three
only
three
get
into
bed
quick
you
catch
cold
when
daylight
we
see
what
to
be
done
but
she
did
not
listen
to
him
she
dressed
herself
completely
bundling
himself
in
the
blankets
lantier
muttered
about
how
stubborn
women
were
what
was
the
hurry
to
announce
a
death
in
the
house
he
was
irritated
at
having
his
sleep
spoiled
by
such
gloomy
matters
meanwhile
gervaise
had
moved
her
things
back
into
her
own
room
then
she
felt
free
to
sit
down
and
cry
no
longer
fearful
of
being
caught
in
lantier
room
she
had
been
fond
of
mother
coupeau
and
felt
a
deep
sorrow
at
her
loss
she
sat
crying
by
herself
her
sobs
loud
in
the
silence
but
coupeau
never
stirred
she
had
spoken
to
him
and
even
shaken
him
and
finally
decided
to
let
him
sleep
he
would
be
more
of
a
nuisance
if
he
woke
up
on
returning
to
the
body
she
found
nana
sitting
up
in
bed
rubbing
her
eyes
the
child
understood
and
with
her
vicious
urchin
curiosity
stretched
out
her
neck
to
get
a
better
view
of
her
grandmother
she
said
nothing
but
she
trembled
slightly
surprised
and
satisfied
in
the
presence
of
this
death
which
she
had
been
promising
herself
for
two
days
past
like
some
nasty
thing
hidden
away
and
forbidden
to
children
and
her
young
eyes
dilated
before
that
white
face
all
emaciated
at
the
last
gasp
by
the
passion
of
life
she
felt
that
tingling
in
her
back
which
she
felt
behind
the
glass
door
when
she
crept
there
to
spy
on
what
was
no
concern
of
chits
like
her
come
get
up
said
her
mother
in
a
low
voice
you
ca
remain
here
she
regretfully
slid
out
of
bed
turning
her
head
round
and
not
taking
her
eyes
off
the
corpse
gervaise
was
much
worried
about
her
not
knowing
where
to
put
her
till
she
was
about
to
tell
her
to
dress
herself
when
lantier
in
his
trousers
and
slippers
rejoined
her
he
could
not
get
to
sleep
again
and
was
rather
ashamed
of
his
behavior
then
everything
was
arranged
she
can
sleep
in
my
bed
murmured
he
she
have
plenty
of
room
nana
looked
at
her
mother
and
lantier
with
her
big
clear
eyes
and
put
on
her
stupid
air
the
same
as
on
new
year
day
when
anyone
made
her
a
present
of
a
box
of
chocolate
candy
and
there
was
certainly
no
need
for
them
to
hurry
her
she
trotted
off
in
her
her
bare
feet
scarcely
touching
the
tiled
floor
she
glided
like
a
snake
into
the
bed
which
was
still
quite
warm
and
she
lay
stretched
out
and
buried
in
it
her
slim
body
scarcely
raising
the
counterpane
each
time
her
mother
entered
the
room
she
beheld
her
with
her
eyes
sparkling
in
her
motionless
face
not
sleeping
not
moving
very
red
with
excitement
and
appearing
to
reflect
on
her
own
affairs
lantier
assisted
gervaise
in
dressing
mother
coupeau
and
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
for
the
body
was
heavy
one
would
never
have
thought
that
that
old
woman
was
so
fat
and
so
white
they
put
on
her
stockings
a
white
petticoat
a
short
linen
jacket
and
a
white
cap
in
short
the
best
of
her
linen
coupeau
continued
snoring
a
high
note
and
a
low
one
the
one
sharp
the
other
flat
one
could
almost
have
imagined
it
to
be
church
music
accompanying
the
good
friday
ceremonies
when
the
corpse
was
dressed
and
properly
laid
out
on
the
bed
lantier
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
wine
for
he
felt
quite
upset
gervaise
searched
the
chest
of
drawers
to
find
a
little
brass
crucifix
which
she
had
brought
from
plassans
but
she
recollected
that
mother
coupeau
had
in
all
probability
sold
it
herself
they
had
lighted
the
stove
and
they
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
half
asleep
on
chairs
finishing
the
bottle
of
wine
that
had
been
opened
worried
and
sulking
as
though
it
was
their
own
fault
towards
seven
before
daylight
coupeau
at
length
awoke
when
he
learnt
his
loss
he
at
first
stood
still
with
dry
eyes
stuttering
and
vaguely
thinking
that
they
were
playing
him
some
joke
then
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
went
and
knelt
beside
the
corpse
his
kissed
it
and
wept
like
a
child
with
such
a
copious
flow
of
tears
that
he
quite
wetted
the
sheet
with
wiping
his
cheeks
gervaise
had
recommenced
sobbing
deeply
affected
by
her
husband
grief
and
the
best
of
friends
with
him
again
yes
he
was
better
at
heart
than
she
thought
he
was
coupeau
despair
mingled
with
a
violent
pain
in
his
head
he
passed
his
fingers
through
his
hair
his
mouth
was
dry
like
on
the
morrow
of
a
booze
and
he
was
still
a
little
drunk
in
spite
of
his
ten
hours
of
sleep
and
clenching
his
fist
he
complained
aloud
dieu
she
was
gone
now
his
poor
mother
whom
he
loved
so
much
ah
what
a
headache
he
had
it
would
settle
him
it
was
like
a
wig
of
fire
and
now
they
were
tearing
out
his
heart
no
it
was
not
just
of
fate
thus
to
set
itself
against
one
man
come
cheer
up
old
fellow
said
lantier
raising
him
from
the
ground
you
must
pull
yourself
together
he
poured
him
out
a
glass
of
wine
but
coupeau
refused
to
drink
what
the
matter
with
me
i
got
copper
in
my
throat
it
mamma
when
i
saw
her
i
got
a
taste
of
copper
in
my
mouth
mamma
dieu
mamma
mamma
and
he
recommenced
crying
like
a
child
then
he
drank
the
glass
of
wine
hoping
to
put
out
the
flame
searing
his
breast
lantier
soon
left
using
the
excuse
of
informing
the
family
and
filing
the
necessary
declaration
at
the
town
hall
really
though
he
felt
the
need
of
fresh
air
and
so
he
took
his
time
smoking
cigarettes
and
enjoying
the
morning
air
when
he
left
madame
lerat
house
he
went
into
a
dairy
place
on
les
batignolles
for
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
and
remained
there
an
hour
thinking
things
over
towards
nine
the
family
were
all
united
in
the
shop
the
shutters
of
which
were
kept
up
lorilleux
did
not
cry
moreover
he
had
some
pressing
work
to
attend
to
and
he
returned
almost
directly
to
his
room
after
having
stalked
about
with
a
face
put
on
for
the
occasion
madame
lorilleux
and
madame
lerat
embraced
the
coupeaus
and
wiped
their
eyes
from
which
a
few
tears
were
falling
but
madame
lorilleux
after
giving
a
hasty
glance
round
the
death
chamber
suddenly
raised
her
voice
to
say
that
it
was
unheard
of
that
one
never
left
a
lighted
lamp
beside
a
corpse
there
should
be
a
candle
and
nana
was
sent
to
purchase
a
packet
of
tall
ones
ah
well
it
made
one
long
to
die
at
she
laid
one
out
in
such
a
fine
fashion
what
a
fool
not
even
to
know
what
to
do
with
a
corpse
had
she
then
never
buried
anyone
in
her
life
madame
lerat
had
to
go
to
the
neighbors
and
borrow
a
crucifix
she
brought
one
back
which
was
too
big
a
cross
of
black
wood
with
a
christ
in
painted
cardboard
fastened
to
it
which
covered
the
whole
of
mother
coupeau
chest
and
seemed
to
crush
her
under
its
weight
then
they
tried
to
obtain
some
holy
water
but
no
one
had
any
and
it
was
again
nana
who
was
sent
to
the
church
to
bring
some
back
in
a
bottle
in
practically
no
time
the
tiny
room
presented
quite
another
appearance
on
a
little
table
a
candle
was
burning
beside
a
glass
full
of
holy
water
into
which
a
sprig
of
boxwood
was
dipped
now
if
anyone
came
it
would
at
least
look
decent
and
they
arranged
the
chairs
in
a
circle
in
the
shop
for
receiving
people
lantier
only
returned
at
eleven
he
had
been
to
the
for
information
the
coffin
is
twelve
francs
said
he
if
you
desire
a
mass
it
will
be
ten
francs
more
then
there
the
hearse
which
is
charged
for
according
to
the
ornaments
oh
it
quite
unnecessary
to
be
fancy
murmured
madame
lorilleux
raising
her
head
in
a
surprised
and
anxious
manner
we
ca
bring
mamma
to
life
again
can
we
one
must
do
according
to
one
means
of
course
that
just
what
i
think
resumed
the
hatter
i
merely
asked
the
prices
to
guide
you
tell
me
what
you
desire
and
after
lunch
i
will
give
the
orders
they
were
talking
in
lowered
voices
only
a
dim
light
came
into
the
room
through
the
cracks
in
the
shutters
the
door
to
the
little
room
stood
half
open
and
from
it
came
the
deep
silence
of
death
laughter
echoed
in
the
courtyard
suddenly
they
heard
the
voice
of
nana
who
had
escaped
from
the
boches
to
whom
she
had
been
sent
she
was
giving
commands
in
her
shrill
voice
and
the
children
were
singing
a
song
about
a
donkey
gervaise
waited
until
it
was
quiet
to
say
we
not
rich
certainly
but
all
the
same
we
wish
to
act
decently
if
mother
coupeau
has
left
us
nothing
it
no
reason
for
pitching
her
into
the
ground
like
a
dog
no
we
must
have
a
mass
and
a
hearse
with
a
few
ornaments
and
who
will
pay
for
them
violently
inquired
madame
lorilleux
not
we
who
lost
some
money
last
week
and
you
either
as
you
stumped
ah
you
ought
however
to
see
where
it
has
led
you
this
trying
to
impress
people
coupeau
when
consulted
mumbled
something
with
a
gesture
of
profound
indifference
and
then
fell
asleep
again
on
his
chair
madame
lerat
said
that
she
would
pay
her
share
she
was
of
gervaise
opinion
they
should
do
things
decently
then
the
two
of
them
fell
to
making
calculations
on
a
piece
of
paper
in
all
it
would
amount
to
about
ninety
francs
because
they
decided
after
a
long
discussion
to
have
a
hearse
ornamented
with
a
narrow
scallop
we
three
concluded
the
laundress
we
give
thirty
francs
each
it
wo
ruin
us
but
madame
lorilleux
broke
out
in
a
fury
well
i
refuse
yes
i
refuse
it
not
for
the
thirty
francs
i
give
a
hundred
thousand
if
i
had
them
and
if
it
would
bring
mamma
to
life
again
only
i
do
like
vain
people
you
got
a
shop
you
only
dream
of
showing
off
before
the
neighborhood
we
do
fall
in
with
it
we
do
we
do
try
to
make
ourselves
out
what
we
are
not
oh
you
can
manage
it
to
please
yourself
put
plumes
on
the
hearse
if
it
amuses
you
no
one
asks
you
for
anything
gervaise
ended
by
answering
even
though
i
should
have
to
sell
myself
i
not
have
anything
to
reproach
myself
with
i
fed
mother
coupeau
without
your
help
and
i
can
certainly
bury
her
without
your
help
also
i
already
once
before
gave
you
a
bit
of
my
mind
i
pick
up
stray
cats
i
not
likely
to
leave
your
mother
in
the
mire
then
madame
lorilleux
burst
into
tears
and
lantier
had
to
prevent
her
from
leaving
the
argument
became
so
noisy
that
madame
lerat
felt
she
had
to
go
quietly
into
the
little
room
and
glance
tearfully
at
her
dead
mother
as
though
fearing
to
find
her
awake
and
listening
just
at
this
moment
the
girls
playing
in
the
courtyard
led
by
nana
began
singing
again
dieu
how
those
children
grate
on
one
nerves
with
their
singing
said
gervaise
all
upset
and
on
the
point
of
sobbing
with
impatience
and
sadness
turning
to
the
hatter
she
said
do
please
make
them
leave
off
and
send
nana
back
to
the
with
a
kick
madame
lerat
and
madame
lorilleux
went
away
to
eat
lunch
promising
to
return
the
coupeaus
sat
down
to
eat
a
bite
without
much
appetite
feeling
hesitant
about
even
raising
a
fork
after
lunch
lantier
went
to
the
undertaker
again
with
the
ninety
francs
thirty
had
come
from
madame
lerat
and
gervaise
had
run
with
her
hair
all
loose
to
borrow
sixty
francs
from
goujet
several
of
the
neighbors
called
in
the
afternoon
mainly
out
of
curiosity
they
went
into
the
little
room
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
sprinkle
some
holy
water
with
the
boxwood
sprig
then
they
sat
in
the
shop
and
talked
endlessly
about
the
departed
mademoiselle
remanjou
had
noticed
that
her
right
eye
was
still
open
madame
gaudron
maintained
that
she
had
a
fine
complexion
for
her
age
madame
fauconnier
kept
repeating
that
she
had
seen
her
having
coffee
only
three
days
earlier
towards
evening
the
coupeaus
were
beginning
to
have
had
enough
of
it
it
was
too
great
an
affliction
for
a
family
to
have
to
keep
a
corpse
so
long
a
time
the
government
ought
to
have
made
a
new
law
on
the
subject
all
through
another
evening
another
night
and
another
morning
no
it
would
never
come
to
an
end
when
one
no
longer
weeps
grief
turns
to
irritation
is
it
not
so
one
would
end
by
misbehaving
oneself
mother
coupeau
dumb
and
stiff
in
the
depths
of
the
narrow
chamber
was
spreading
more
and
more
over
the
lodging
and
becoming
heavy
enough
to
crush
the
people
in
it
and
the
family
in
spite
of
itself
gradually
fell
into
the
ordinary
mode
of
life
and
lost
some
portion
of
its
respect
you
must
have
a
mouthful
with
us
said
gervaise
to
madame
lerat
and
madame
lorilleux
when
they
returned
we
too
sad
we
must
keep
together
they
laid
the
cloth
on
the
each
one
on
seeing
the
plates
thought
of
the
feastings
they
had
had
on
it
lantier
had
returned
lorilleux
came
down
a
had
just
brought
a
meat
pie
for
the
laundress
was
too
upset
to
attend
to
any
cooking
as
they
were
taking
their
seats
boche
came
to
say
that
monsieur
marescot
asked
to
be
admitted
and
the
landlord
appeared
looking
very
grave
and
wearing
a
broad
decoration
on
his
he
bowed
in
silence
and
went
straight
to
the
little
room
where
he
knelt
down
all
the
family
leaving
the
table
stood
up
greatly
impressed
monsieur
marescot
having
finished
his
devotions
passed
into
the
shop
and
said
to
the
coupeaus
i
have
come
for
the
two
quarters
rent
that
overdue
are
you
prepared
to
pay
no
sir
not
quite
stammered
gervaise
greatly
put
out
at
hearing
this
mentioned
before
the
lorilleuxs
you
see
with
the
misfortune
which
has
fallen
upon
us
no
doubt
but
everyone
has
their
troubles
resumed
the
landlord
spreading
out
his
immense
fingers
which
indicated
the
former
workman
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
can
not
wait
any
longer
if
i
am
not
paid
by
the
morning
after
i
shall
be
obliged
to
have
you
put
out
gervaise
struck
dumb
imploringly
clasped
her
hands
her
eyes
full
of
tears
with
an
energetic
shake
of
his
big
bony
head
he
gave
her
to
understand
that
supplications
were
useless
besides
the
respect
due
to
the
dead
forbade
all
discussion
he
discreetly
retired
walking
backwards
a
thousand
pardons
for
having
disturbed
you
murmured
he
the
morning
after
do
not
forget
and
as
on
withdrawing
he
again
passed
before
the
little
room
he
saluted
the
corpse
a
last
time
through
the
wide
open
door
by
devoutly
bending
his
knee
they
began
eating
and
gobbled
the
food
down
very
quickly
so
as
not
to
seem
to
be
enjoying
it
only
slowing
down
when
they
reached
the
dessert
occasionally
gervaise
or
one
of
the
sisters
would
get
up
still
holding
her
napkin
to
look
into
the
small
room
they
made
plenty
of
strong
coffee
to
keep
them
awake
through
the
night
the
poissons
arrived
about
eight
and
were
invited
for
coffee
then
lantier
who
had
been
watching
gervaise
face
seemed
to
seize
an
opportunity
that
he
had
been
waiting
for
ever
since
the
morning
in
speaking
of
the
indecency
of
landlords
who
entered
houses
of
mourning
to
demand
their
money
he
said
he
a
jesuit
the
beast
with
his
air
of
officiating
at
a
mass
but
in
your
place
i
just
chuck
up
the
shop
altogether
gervaise
quite
worn
out
and
feeling
weak
and
nervous
gave
way
and
replied
yes
i
shall
certainly
not
wait
for
the
bailiffs
ah
it
more
than
i
can
bear
more
than
i
can
bear
the
lorilleuxs
delighted
at
the
idea
that
would
no
longer
have
a
shop
approved
the
plan
immensely
one
could
hardly
conceive
the
great
cost
a
shop
was
if
she
only
earned
three
francs
working
for
others
she
at
least
had
no
expenses
she
did
not
risk
losing
large
sums
of
money
they
repeated
this
argument
to
coupeau
urging
him
on
he
drank
a
great
deal
and
remained
in
a
continuous
fit
of
sensibility
weeping
all
day
by
himself
in
his
plate
as
the
laundress
seemed
to
be
allowing
herself
to
be
convinced
lantier
looked
at
the
poissons
and
winked
and
tall
virginie
intervened
making
herself
most
amiable
you
know
we
might
arrange
the
matter
between
us
i
would
relieve
you
of
the
rest
of
the
lease
and
settle
your
matter
with
the
landlord
in
short
you
would
not
be
worried
nearly
so
much
no
thanks
declared
gervaise
shaking
herself
as
though
she
felt
a
shudder
pass
over
her
i
work
i
got
my
two
arms
thank
heaven
to
help
me
out
of
my
difficulties
we
can
talk
about
it
some
other
time
the
hatter
hastened
to
put
in
it
scarcely
the
thing
to
do
so
this
evening
some
other
time
in
the
morning
for
instance
at
this
moment
madame
lerat
who
had
gone
into
the
little
room
uttered
a
faint
cry
she
had
had
a
fright
because
she
had
found
the
candle
burnt
out
they
all
busied
themselves
in
lighting
another
they
shook
their
heads
saying
that
it
was
not
a
good
sign
when
the
light
went
out
beside
a
corpse
the
wake
commenced
coupeau
had
gone
to
lie
down
not
to
sleep
said
he
but
to
think
and
five
minutes
afterwards
he
was
snoring
when
they
sent
nana
off
to
sleep
at
the
boches
she
cried
she
had
been
looking
forward
ever
since
the
morning
to
being
nice
and
warm
in
her
good
friend
lantier
big
bed
the
poissons
stayed
till
midnight
some
hot
wine
had
been
made
in
a
because
the
coffee
affected
the
ladies
nerves
too
much
the
conversation
became
tenderly
effusive
virginie
talked
of
the
country
she
would
like
to
be
buried
at
the
corner
of
a
wood
with
wild
flowers
on
her
grave
madame
lerat
had
already
put
by
in
her
wardrobe
the
sheet
for
her
shroud
and
she
kept
it
perfumed
with
a
bunch
of
lavender
she
wished
always
to
have
a
nice
smell
under
her
nose
when
she
would
be
eating
the
dandelions
by
the
roots
then
with
no
sort
of
transition
the
policeman
related
that
he
had
arrested
a
fine
girl
that
morning
who
had
been
stealing
from
a
shop
on
undressing
her
at
the
commissary
of
police
they
had
found
ten
sausages
hanging
round
her
body
and
madame
lorilleux
having
remarked
with
a
look
of
disgust
that
she
would
not
eat
any
of
those
sausages
the
party
burst
into
a
gentle
laugh
the
wake
became
livelier
though
not
ceasing
to
preserve
appearances
but
just
as
they
were
finishing
the
hot
wine
a
peculiar
noise
a
dull
trickling
sound
issued
from
the
little
room
all
raised
their
heads
and
looked
at
each
other
it
nothing
said
lantier
quietly
lowering
his
voice
emptying
the
explanation
caused
the
others
to
nod
their
heads
in
a
reassured
way
and
they
replaced
their
glasses
on
the
table
when
the
poissons
left
for
home
lantier
left
also
saying
he
would
sleep
with
a
friend
and
leave
his
bed
for
the
ladies
in
case
they
wanted
to
take
turns
napping
lorilleux
went
upstairs
to
bed
gervaise
and
the
two
sisters
arranged
themselves
by
the
stove
where
they
huddled
together
close
to
the
warmth
talking
quietly
coupeau
was
still
snoring
madame
lorilleux
was
complaining
that
she
did
have
a
black
dress
and
asked
gervaise
about
the
black
skirt
they
had
given
mother
coupeau
on
her
saint
day
gervaise
went
to
look
for
it
madame
lorilleux
then
wanted
some
of
the
old
linen
and
mentioned
the
bed
the
wardrobe
and
the
two
chairs
as
she
looked
around
for
other
odds
and
ends
madame
lerat
had
to
serve
as
peace
maker
when
a
quarrel
nearly
broke
out
she
pointed
out
that
as
the
coupeaus
had
cared
for
their
mother
they
deserved
to
keep
the
few
things
she
had
left
soon
they
were
all
dozing
around
the
stove
the
night
seemed
terribly
long
to
them
now
and
again
they
shook
themselves
drank
some
coffee
and
stretched
their
necks
in
the
direction
of
the
little
room
where
the
candle
which
was
not
to
be
snuffed
was
burning
with
a
dull
red
flame
flickering
the
more
because
of
the
black
soot
on
the
wick
towards
morning
they
shivered
in
spite
of
the
great
heat
of
the
stove
anguish
and
the
fatigue
of
having
talked
too
much
was
stifling
them
whilst
their
mouths
were
parched
and
their
eyes
ached
madame
lerat
threw
herself
on
lantier
bed
and
snored
as
loud
as
a
man
whilst
the
other
two
their
heads
falling
forward
and
almost
touching
their
knees
slept
before
the
fire
at
daybreak
a
shudder
awoke
them
mother
coupeau
candle
had
again
gone
out
and
as
in
the
obscurity
the
dull
trickling
sound
recommenced
madame
lorilleux
gave
the
explanation
of
it
anew
in
a
loud
voice
so
as
to
reassure
herself
she
emptying
repeated
she
lighting
another
candle
the
funeral
was
to
take
place
at
ten
a
nice
morning
to
add
to
the
night
and
the
day
before
gervaise
though
without
a
sou
said
she
would
have
given
a
hundred
francs
to
anybody
who
would
have
come
and
taken
mother
coupeau
away
three
hours
sooner
no
one
may
love
people
but
they
are
too
great
a
weight
when
they
are
dead
and
the
more
one
has
loved
them
the
sooner
one
would
like
to
be
rid
of
their
bodies
the
morning
of
a
funeral
is
fortunately
full
of
diversions
one
has
all
sorts
of
preparations
to
make
to
begin
with
they
lunched
then
it
happened
to
be
old
bazouge
the
undertaker
helper
who
lived
on
the
sixth
floor
who
brought
the
coffin
and
the
sack
of
bran
he
was
never
sober
the
worthy
fellow
at
eight
that
day
he
was
still
lively
from
the
booze
of
the
day
before
this
is
for
here
is
it
asked
he
and
he
laid
down
the
coffin
which
creaked
like
a
new
box
but
as
he
was
throwing
the
sack
of
bran
on
one
side
he
stood
with
a
look
of
amazement
in
his
eyes
his
mouth
opened
wide
on
beholding
gervaise
before
him
beg
pardon
excuse
me
i
made
a
mistake
stammered
he
i
was
told
it
was
for
you
he
had
already
taken
up
the
sack
again
and
the
laundress
was
obliged
to
call
to
him
leave
it
alone
it
for
here
ah
dieu
now
i
understand
resumed
he
slapping
his
thigh
it
for
the
old
lady
gervaise
had
turned
quite
pale
old
bazouge
had
brought
the
coffin
for
her
by
way
of
apology
he
tried
to
be
gallant
and
continued
i
not
to
blame
am
i
it
was
said
yesterday
that
someone
on
the
ground
floor
had
passed
away
then
i
thought
you
know
in
our
business
these
things
enter
by
one
ear
and
go
out
by
the
other
all
the
same
my
compliments
to
you
as
late
as
possible
eh
that
best
though
life
is
always
amusing
ah
no
by
no
means
as
gervaise
listened
to
him
she
draw
back
afraid
he
would
grab
her
and
take
her
away
in
the
box
she
remembered
the
time
before
when
he
had
told
her
he
knew
of
women
who
would
thank
him
to
come
and
get
them
well
she
was
ready
yet
dieu
the
thought
sent
chills
down
her
spine
her
life
may
have
been
bitter
but
she
was
ready
to
give
it
up
yet
no
she
would
starve
for
years
first
he
abominably
drunk
murmured
she
with
an
air
of
disgust
mingled
with
dread
they
at
least
ought
to
send
us
tipplers
we
pay
dear
enough
then
he
became
insolent
and
jeered
see
here
little
woman
it
only
put
off
until
another
time
entirely
at
your
service
remember
you
only
to
make
me
a
sign
the
ladies
consoler
and
do
spit
on
old
bazouge
because
he
held
in
his
arms
finer
ones
than
you
who
let
themselves
be
tucked
in
without
a
murmur
very
pleased
to
continue
their
in
the
dark
hold
your
tongue
old
bazouge
said
lorilleux
severely
having
hastened
to
the
spot
on
hearing
the
noise
such
jokes
are
highly
improper
if
we
complained
about
you
you
would
get
the
sack
come
be
off
as
you
no
respect
for
principles
bazouge
moved
away
but
one
could
hear
him
stuttering
as
he
dragged
along
the
pavement
well
what
principles
there
no
such
thing
as
principles
there
no
such
thing
as
principles
there
only
common
decency
at
length
ten
struck
the
hearse
was
late
there
were
already
several
people
in
the
shop
friends
and
neighbors
monsieur
madinier
madame
gaudron
mademoiselle
remanjou
and
every
minute
a
man
or
a
woman
head
was
thrust
out
of
the
gaping
opening
of
the
door
between
the
closed
shutters
to
see
if
that
creeping
hearse
was
in
sight
the
family
all
together
in
the
back
room
was
shaking
hands
short
pauses
occurred
interrupted
by
rapid
whisperings
a
tiresome
and
feverish
waiting
with
sudden
rushes
of
skirts
madame
lorilleux
who
had
forgotten
her
handkerchief
or
else
madame
lerat
who
was
trying
to
borrow
a
everyone
on
arriving
beheld
the
open
coffin
in
the
centre
of
the
little
room
before
the
bed
and
in
spite
of
oneself
each
stood
covertly
studying
it
calculating
that
plump
mother
coupeau
would
never
fit
into
it
they
all
looked
at
each
other
with
this
thought
in
their
eyes
though
without
communicating
it
but
there
was
a
slight
pushing
at
the
front
door
monsieur
madinier
extending
his
arms
came
and
said
in
a
low
grave
voice
here
they
are
it
was
not
the
hearse
though
four
helpers
entered
hastily
in
single
file
with
their
red
faces
their
hands
all
lumpy
like
persons
in
the
habit
of
moving
heavy
things
and
their
rusty
black
clothes
worn
and
frayed
from
constant
rubbing
against
coffins
old
bazouge
walked
first
very
drunk
and
very
proper
as
soon
as
he
was
at
work
he
found
his
equilibrium
they
did
not
utter
a
word
but
slightly
bowed
their
heads
already
weighing
mother
coupeau
with
a
glance
and
they
did
not
dawdle
the
poor
old
woman
was
packed
in
in
the
time
one
takes
to
sneeze
a
young
fellow
with
a
squint
the
smallest
of
the
men
poured
the
bran
into
the
coffin
and
spread
it
out
the
tall
and
thin
one
spread
the
winding
sheet
over
the
bran
then
two
at
the
feet
and
two
at
the
head
all
four
took
hold
of
the
body
and
lifted
it
mother
coupeau
was
in
the
box
but
it
was
a
tight
fit
she
touched
on
every
side
the
undertaker
helpers
were
now
standing
up
and
waiting
the
little
one
with
the
squint
took
the
coffin
lid
by
way
of
inviting
the
family
to
bid
their
last
farewell
whilst
bazouge
had
filled
his
mouth
with
nails
and
was
holding
the
hammer
in
readiness
then
coupeau
his
two
sisters
and
gervaise
threw
themselves
on
their
knees
and
kissed
the
mamma
who
was
going
away
weeping
bitterly
the
hot
tears
falling
on
and
streaming
down
the
stiff
face
now
cold
as
ice
there
was
a
prolonged
sound
of
sobbing
the
lid
was
placed
on
and
old
bazouge
knocked
the
nails
in
with
the
style
of
a
packer
two
blows
for
each
and
they
none
of
them
could
hear
any
longer
their
own
weeping
in
that
din
which
resembled
the
noise
of
furniture
being
repaired
it
was
over
the
time
for
starting
had
arrived
what
a
fuss
to
make
at
such
a
time
said
madame
lorilleux
to
her
husband
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
hearse
before
the
door
the
hearse
was
creating
quite
a
revolution
in
the
neighborhood
the
called
to
the
grocer
men
the
little
clockmaker
came
out
on
to
the
pavement
the
neighbors
leant
out
of
their
windows
and
all
these
people
talked
about
the
scallop
with
its
white
cotton
fringe
ah
the
coupeaus
would
have
done
better
to
have
paid
their
debts
but
as
the
lorilleuxs
said
when
one
is
proud
it
shows
itself
everywhere
and
in
spite
of
everything
it
shameful
gervaise
was
saying
at
the
same
moment
speaking
of
the
chainmaker
and
his
wife
to
think
that
those
skinflints
have
not
even
brought
a
bunch
of
violets
for
their
mother
the
lorilleuxs
true
enough
had
come
madame
lerat
had
given
a
wreath
of
artificial
flowers
and
a
wreath
of
immortelles
and
a
bouquet
bought
by
the
coupeaus
were
also
placed
on
the
coffin
the
undertaker
helpers
had
to
give
a
mighty
heave
to
lift
the
coffin
and
carry
it
to
the
hearse
it
was
some
time
before
the
procession
was
formed
coupeau
and
lorilleux
in
frock
coats
and
with
their
hats
in
their
hands
were
chief
mourners
the
first
in
his
emotion
which
two
glasses
of
white
wine
early
in
the
morning
had
helped
to
sustain
clung
to
his
arm
with
no
strength
in
his
legs
and
a
violent
headache
then
followed
the
other
men
monsieur
madinier
very
grave
and
all
in
black
wearing
a
over
his
blouse
boche
whose
yellow
trousers
produced
the
effect
of
a
petard
lantier
gaudron
poisson
and
others
the
ladies
came
next
in
the
first
row
madame
lorilleux
dragging
the
deceased
skirt
which
she
had
altered
madame
lerat
hiding
under
a
shawl
her
hastily
mourning
a
gown
with
lilac
trimmings
and
following
them
virginie
madame
gaudron
madame
fauconnier
mademoiselle
remanjou
and
the
rest
when
the
hearse
started
and
slowly
descended
the
rue
de
la
amidst
signs
of
the
cross
and
heads
bared
the
four
helpers
took
the
lead
two
in
front
the
two
others
on
the
right
and
left
gervaise
had
remained
behind
to
close
the
shop
she
left
nana
with
madame
boche
and
ran
to
rejoin
the
procession
whilst
the
child
firmly
held
by
the
concierge
under
the
porch
watched
with
a
deeply
interested
gaze
her
grandmother
disappear
at
the
end
of
the
street
in
that
beautiful
carriage
at
the
moment
when
gervaise
caught
up
with
the
procession
goujet
arrived
from
another
direction
he
nodded
to
her
so
sympathetically
that
she
was
reminded
of
how
unhappy
she
was
and
began
to
cry
again
as
goujet
took
his
place
with
the
men
the
ceremony
at
the
church
was
soon
got
through
the
mass
dragged
a
little
though
because
the
priest
was
very
old
and
preferred
to
remain
outside
on
account
of
the
collection
monsieur
madinier
studied
the
priests
all
the
while
and
communicated
his
observations
to
lantier
those
jokers
though
so
glib
with
their
latin
did
not
even
know
a
word
of
what
they
were
saying
they
buried
a
person
just
in
the
same
way
that
they
would
have
baptized
or
married
him
without
the
least
feeling
in
their
heart
happily
the
cemetery
was
not
far
off
the
little
cemetery
of
la
chapelle
a
bit
of
a
garden
which
opened
on
to
the
rue
marcadet
the
procession
arrived
disbanded
with
stampings
of
feet
and
everybody
talking
of
his
own
affairs
the
hard
earth
resounded
and
many
would
have
liked
to
have
moved
about
to
keep
themselves
warm
the
gaping
hole
beside
which
the
coffin
was
laid
was
already
frozen
over
and
looked
white
and
stony
like
a
plaster
quarry
and
the
followers
grouped
round
little
heaps
of
gravel
did
not
find
it
pleasant
standing
in
such
piercing
cold
whilst
looking
at
the
hole
likewise
bored
them
at
length
a
priest
in
a
surplice
came
out
of
a
little
cottage
he
shivered
and
one
could
see
his
steaming
breath
at
each
that
he
uttered
at
the
final
sign
of
the
cross
he
bolted
off
without
the
least
desire
to
go
through
the
service
again
the
sexton
took
his
shovel
but
on
account
of
the
frost
he
was
only
able
to
detach
large
lumps
of
earth
which
beat
a
fine
tune
down
below
a
regular
bombardment
of
the
coffin
an
enfilade
of
artillery
sufficient
to
make
one
think
the
wood
was
splitting
one
may
be
a
cynic
nevertheless
that
sort
of
music
soon
upsets
one
stomach
the
weeping
recommenced
they
moved
off
they
even
got
outside
but
they
still
heard
the
detonations
blowing
on
his
fingers
uttered
an
observation
aloud
de
dieu
poor
mother
coupeau
wo
feel
very
warm
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
the
to
the
few
friends
who
remained
in
the
street
with
the
family
will
you
permit
us
to
offer
you
some
refreshments
he
led
the
way
to
a
wine
shop
in
the
rue
marcadet
the
arrival
at
the
cemetery
gervaise
remaining
outside
called
goujet
who
was
moving
off
after
again
nodding
to
her
why
did
he
accept
a
glass
of
wine
he
was
in
a
hurry
he
was
going
back
to
the
workshop
then
they
looked
at
each
other
a
moment
without
speaking
i
must
ask
your
pardon
for
troubling
you
about
the
sixty
francs
at
length
murmured
the
laundress
i
was
half
crazy
i
thought
of
you
oh
do
mention
it
you
fully
forgiven
interrupted
the
blacksmith
and
you
know
i
am
quite
at
your
service
if
any
misfortune
should
overtake
you
but
do
say
anything
to
mamma
because
she
has
her
ideas
and
i
do
wish
to
cause
her
annoyance
she
gazed
at
him
he
seemed
to
her
such
a
good
man
and
and
so
handsome
she
was
on
the
verge
of
accepting
his
former
proposal
to
go
away
with
him
and
find
happiness
together
somewhere
else
then
an
evil
thought
came
to
her
it
was
the
idea
of
borrowing
the
six
back
rent
from
him
she
trembled
and
resumed
in
a
caressing
tone
of
voice
we
still
friends
are
we
he
shook
his
head
as
he
answered
yes
we
always
be
friends
it
just
that
you
know
all
is
over
between
us
and
he
went
off
with
long
strides
leaving
gervaise
bewildered
listening
to
his
last
words
which
rang
in
her
ears
with
the
clang
of
a
big
bell
on
entering
the
wine
shop
she
seemed
to
hear
a
hollow
voice
within
her
which
said
all
is
over
well
all
is
over
there
is
nothing
more
for
me
to
do
if
all
is
over
sitting
down
she
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
bread
and
cheese
and
emptied
a
glass
full
of
wine
which
she
found
before
her
the
wine
shop
was
a
single
long
room
with
a
low
ceiling
occupied
by
two
large
tables
on
which
loaves
of
bread
large
chunks
of
brie
cheese
and
bottles
of
wine
were
set
out
they
ate
informally
without
a
tablecloth
near
the
stove
at
the
back
the
undertaker
helpers
were
finishing
their
lunch
dieu
exclaimed
monsieur
madinier
we
each
have
our
time
the
old
folks
make
room
for
the
young
ones
your
lodging
will
seem
very
empty
to
you
now
when
you
go
home
oh
my
brother
is
going
to
give
notice
said
madame
lorilleux
quickly
that
shop
ruined
they
had
been
working
upon
coupeau
everyone
was
urging
him
to
give
up
the
lease
madame
lerat
herself
who
had
been
on
very
good
terms
with
lantier
and
virginie
for
some
time
past
and
who
was
tickled
with
the
idea
that
they
were
a
trifle
smitten
with
each
other
talked
of
bankruptcy
and
prison
putting
on
the
most
terrified
airs
and
suddenly
the
already
overdosed
with
liquor
flew
into
a
passion
his
emotion
turned
to
fury
listen
cried
he
poking
his
nose
in
his
wife
face
i
intend
that
you
shall
listen
to
me
your
confounded
head
will
always
have
its
own
way
but
this
time
i
intend
to
have
mine
i
warn
you
ah
well
said
lantier
one
never
yet
brought
her
to
reason
by
fair
words
it
wants
a
mallet
to
drive
it
into
her
head
for
a
time
they
both
went
on
at
her
meanwhile
the
brie
was
quickly
disappearing
and
the
wine
bottles
were
pouring
like
fountains
gervaise
began
to
weaken
under
this
persistent
pounding
she
answered
nothing
but
hurried
herself
her
mouth
ever
full
as
though
she
had
been
very
hungry
when
they
got
tired
she
gently
raised
her
head
and
said
that
enough
is
it
i
do
care
a
straw
for
the
shop
i
want
no
more
of
it
do
you
understand
it
can
go
to
the
deuce
all
is
over
then
they
ordered
some
more
bread
and
cheese
and
talked
business
the
poissons
took
the
rest
of
the
lease
and
agreed
to
be
answerable
for
the
two
quarters
rent
overdue
boche
moreover
pompously
agreed
to
the
arrangement
in
the
landlord
name
he
even
then
and
there
let
a
lodging
to
the
coupeaus
the
vacant
one
on
the
sixth
floor
in
the
same
passage
as
the
lorilleuxs
apartment
as
for
lantier
well
he
would
like
to
keep
his
room
if
it
did
not
inconvenience
the
poissons
the
policeman
bowed
it
did
not
inconvenience
him
at
all
friends
always
get
on
together
in
spite
of
any
difference
in
their
political
ideas
and
lantier
without
mixing
himself
up
any
more
in
the
matter
like
a
man
who
has
at
length
settled
his
little
business
helped
himself
to
an
enormous
slice
of
bread
and
cheese
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
ate
devoutly
his
blood
tingling
beneath
his
skin
his
whole
body
burning
with
a
sly
joy
and
he
blinked
his
eyes
to
peep
first
at
gervaise
and
then
at
virginie
hi
old
bazouge
called
coupeau
come
and
have
a
drink
we
not
proud
we
all
workers
the
four
undertaker
helpers
who
had
started
to
leave
came
back
to
raise
glasses
with
the
group
they
thought
that
the
lady
had
weighed
quite
a
bit
and
they
had
certainly
earned
a
glass
of
wine
old
bazouge
gazed
steadily
at
gervaise
without
saying
a
word
it
made
her
feel
uneasy
though
and
she
got
up
and
left
the
men
who
were
beginning
to
show
signs
of
being
drunk
coupeau
began
to
sob
again
saying
he
was
feeling
very
sad
that
evening
when
gervaise
found
herself
at
home
again
she
remained
in
a
stupefied
state
on
a
chair
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
rooms
were
immense
and
deserted
really
it
would
be
a
good
riddance
but
it
was
certainly
not
only
mother
coupeau
that
she
had
left
at
the
bottom
of
the
hole
in
the
little
garden
of
the
rue
marcadet
she
missed
too
many
things
most
likely
a
part
of
her
life
and
her
shop
and
her
pride
of
being
an
employer
and
other
feelings
besides
which
she
had
buried
on
that
day
yes
the
walls
were
bare
and
her
heart
also
it
was
a
complete
clear
out
a
tumble
into
the
pit
and
she
felt
too
tired
she
would
pick
herself
up
again
later
on
if
she
could
at
ten
when
undressing
nana
cried
and
stamped
she
wanted
to
sleep
in
mother
coupeau
bed
her
mother
tried
to
frighten
her
but
the
child
was
too
precocious
corpses
only
filled
her
with
a
great
curiosity
so
that
for
the
sake
of
peace
she
was
allowed
to
lie
down
in
mother
coupeau
place
she
liked
big
beds
the
chit
she
spread
herself
out
and
rolled
about
she
slept
uncommonly
well
that
night
in
the
warm
and
pleasant
feather
bed
chapter
x
the
coupeaus
new
lodging
was
on
the
sixth
floor
staircase
b
after
passing
mademoiselle
remanjou
door
you
took
the
corridor
to
the
left
and
then
turned
again
further
along
the
first
door
was
for
the
apartment
of
the
bijards
almost
opposite
in
an
airless
corner
under
a
small
staircase
leading
to
the
roof
was
where
pere
bru
slept
two
doors
further
was
bazouge
room
and
the
coupeaus
were
opposite
him
overlooking
the
court
with
one
room
and
a
closet
there
were
only
two
more
doors
along
the
corridor
before
reaching
that
of
the
lorilleuxs
at
the
far
end
a
room
and
a
closet
no
more
the
coupeaus
perched
there
now
and
the
room
was
scarcely
larger
than
one
hand
and
they
had
to
do
everything
in
there
eat
sleep
and
all
the
rest
nana
bed
just
squeezed
into
the
closet
she
had
to
dress
in
her
father
and
mother
room
and
her
door
was
kept
open
at
so
that
she
should
not
be
suffocated
there
was
so
little
space
that
gervaise
had
left
many
things
in
the
shop
for
the
poissons
a
bed
a
table
and
four
chairs
completely
filled
their
new
apartment
but
she
did
have
the
courage
to
part
with
her
old
bureau
and
so
it
blocked
off
half
the
window
this
made
the
room
dark
and
gloomy
especially
since
one
shutter
was
stuck
shut
gervaise
was
now
so
fat
that
there
was
room
for
her
in
the
limited
window
space
and
she
had
to
lean
sideways
and
crane
her
neck
if
she
wanted
to
see
the
courtyard
during
the
first
few
days
the
laundress
would
continually
sit
down
and
cry
it
seemed
to
her
too
hard
not
being
able
to
move
about
in
her
home
after
having
been
used
to
so
much
room
she
felt
stifled
she
remained
at
the
window
for
hours
squeezed
between
the
wall
and
the
drawers
and
getting
a
stiff
neck
it
was
only
there
that
she
could
breathe
freely
however
the
courtyard
inspired
rather
melancholy
thoughts
opposite
her
on
the
sunny
side
she
would
see
that
same
window
she
had
dreamed
about
long
ago
where
the
spring
brought
scarlet
vines
her
own
room
was
on
the
shady
side
where
pots
of
mignonette
died
within
a
week
oh
this
was
at
all
the
sort
of
life
she
had
dreamed
of
she
had
to
wallow
in
filth
instead
of
having
flowers
all
about
her
on
leaning
out
one
day
gervaise
experienced
a
peculiar
sensation
she
fancied
she
beheld
herself
down
below
near
the
concierge
room
under
the
porch
her
nose
in
the
air
and
examining
the
house
for
the
first
time
and
this
leap
thirteen
years
backwards
caused
her
heart
to
throb
the
courtyard
was
a
little
dingier
and
the
walls
more
stained
otherwise
it
had
changed
much
but
she
herself
felt
terribly
changed
and
worn
to
begin
with
she
was
no
longer
below
her
face
raised
to
heaven
feeling
content
and
courageous
and
aspiring
to
a
handsome
lodging
she
was
right
up
under
the
roof
among
the
most
wretched
in
the
dirtiest
hole
the
part
that
never
received
a
ray
of
sunshine
and
that
explained
her
tears
she
could
scarcely
feel
enchanted
with
her
fate
however
when
gervaise
had
grown
somewhat
used
to
it
the
early
days
of
the
little
family
in
their
new
home
did
not
pass
off
so
badly
the
winter
was
almost
over
and
the
trifle
of
money
received
for
the
furniture
sold
to
virginie
helped
to
make
things
comfortable
then
with
the
fine
weather
came
a
piece
of
luck
coupeau
was
engaged
to
work
in
the
country
at
etampes
and
he
was
there
for
nearly
three
months
without
once
getting
drunk
cured
for
a
time
by
the
fresh
air
one
has
no
idea
what
a
quench
it
is
to
the
tippler
thirst
to
leave
paris
where
the
very
streets
are
full
of
the
fumes
of
wine
and
brandy
on
his
return
he
was
as
fresh
as
a
rose
and
he
brought
back
in
his
pocket
four
hundred
francs
with
which
they
paid
the
two
overdue
quarters
rent
at
the
shop
that
the
poissons
had
become
answerable
for
and
also
the
most
pressing
of
their
little
debts
in
the
neighborhood
gervaise
thus
opened
two
or
three
streets
through
which
she
had
not
passed
for
a
long
time
she
had
naturally
become
an
ironer
again
madame
fauconnier
was
quite
if
you
flattered
her
a
bit
and
she
was
happy
to
take
gervaise
back
even
paying
her
the
same
three
francs
a
day
as
her
best
worker
this
was
out
of
respect
for
her
former
status
as
an
employer
the
household
seemed
to
be
getting
on
well
and
gervaise
looked
forward
to
the
day
when
all
the
debts
would
be
paid
hard
work
and
economy
would
solve
all
their
money
troubles
unfortunately
she
dreamed
of
this
in
the
warm
satisfaction
of
the
large
sum
earned
by
her
husband
soon
she
said
that
the
good
things
never
lasted
and
took
things
as
they
came
what
the
coupeaus
most
suffered
from
at
that
time
was
seeing
the
poissons
installing
themselves
at
their
former
shop
they
were
not
naturally
of
a
particularly
jealous
disposition
but
people
aggravated
them
by
purposely
expressing
amazement
in
their
presence
at
the
embellishments
of
their
successors
the
boches
and
the
lorilleuxs
especially
never
tired
according
to
them
no
one
had
ever
seen
so
beautiful
a
shop
they
were
also
continually
mentioning
the
filthy
state
in
which
the
poissons
had
found
the
premises
saying
that
it
had
cost
thirty
francs
for
the
cleaning
alone
after
much
deliberation
virginie
had
decided
to
open
a
shop
specializing
in
candies
chocolate
coffee
and
tea
lantier
had
advised
this
saying
there
was
much
money
to
be
made
from
such
delicacies
the
shop
was
stylishly
painted
black
with
yellow
stripes
three
carpenters
worked
for
eight
days
on
the
interior
putting
up
shelves
display
cases
and
counters
poisson
small
inheritance
must
have
been
almost
completely
used
but
virginie
was
ecstatic
the
lorilleuxs
and
the
boches
made
sure
that
gervaise
did
not
miss
a
single
improvement
and
chuckled
to
themselves
while
watching
her
expression
there
was
also
a
question
of
a
man
beneath
all
this
it
was
reported
that
lantier
had
broken
off
with
gervaise
the
neighborhood
declared
that
it
was
quite
right
in
short
it
gave
a
moral
tone
to
the
street
and
all
the
honor
of
the
separation
was
accorded
to
the
crafty
hatter
on
whom
all
the
ladies
continued
to
dote
some
said
that
she
was
still
crazy
about
him
and
he
had
to
slap
her
to
make
her
leave
him
alone
of
course
no
one
told
the
actual
truth
it
was
too
simple
and
not
interesting
enough
actually
lantier
climbed
to
the
sixth
floor
to
see
her
whenever
he
felt
the
impulse
mademoiselle
remanjou
had
often
seen
him
coming
out
of
the
coupeaus
at
odd
hours
the
situation
was
even
more
complicated
by
neighborhood
gossip
linking
lantier
and
virginie
the
neighbors
were
a
bit
too
hasty
in
this
also
he
had
not
even
reached
the
stage
of
with
her
still
the
lorilleuxs
delighted
in
talking
sympathetically
to
gervaise
about
the
affair
between
lantier
and
virginie
the
boches
maintained
they
had
never
seen
a
more
handsome
couple
the
odd
thing
in
all
this
was
that
the
rue
de
la
seemed
to
have
no
objection
to
this
new
arrangement
which
everyone
thought
was
progressing
nicely
those
who
had
been
so
harsh
to
gervaise
were
now
quite
lenient
toward
virginie
gervaise
had
previously
heard
numerous
reports
about
lantier
affairs
with
all
sorts
of
girls
on
the
street
and
they
had
bothered
her
so
little
that
she
had
even
felt
enough
resentment
to
break
off
the
affair
however
this
new
intrigue
with
virginie
was
quite
so
easy
to
accept
because
she
was
sure
that
the
two
of
them
were
just
out
to
spite
her
she
hid
her
resentment
though
to
avoid
giving
any
satisfaction
to
her
enemies
mademoiselle
remanjou
thought
that
gervaise
had
words
with
lantier
over
this
because
one
afternoon
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
slap
there
was
certainly
a
quarrel
because
lantier
stopped
speaking
to
gervaise
for
a
couple
of
weeks
but
then
he
was
the
first
one
to
make
up
and
things
seemed
to
go
along
the
same
as
before
coupeau
found
all
this
most
amusing
the
complacent
husband
who
had
been
blind
to
his
own
situation
laughed
heartily
at
poisson
predicament
then
coupeau
even
teased
gervaise
her
lovers
always
dropped
her
first
the
blacksmith
and
now
the
hatmaker
the
trouble
was
that
she
got
involved
with
undependable
trades
she
should
take
up
with
a
mason
a
good
solid
man
he
said
such
things
as
if
he
were
joking
but
they
upset
gervaise
because
his
small
grey
eyes
seemed
to
be
boring
right
into
her
on
evenings
when
coupeau
became
bored
being
alone
with
his
wife
up
in
their
tiny
hole
under
the
roof
he
would
go
down
for
lantier
and
invite
him
up
he
thought
their
dump
was
too
dreary
without
lantier
company
so
he
patched
things
up
between
gervaise
and
lantier
whenever
they
had
a
falling
out
in
the
midst
of
all
this
lantier
put
on
the
most
consequential
airs
he
showed
himself
both
paternal
and
dignified
on
three
successive
occasions
he
had
prevented
a
quarrel
between
the
coupeaus
and
the
poissons
the
good
understanding
between
the
two
families
formed
a
part
of
his
contentment
thanks
to
the
tender
though
firm
glances
with
which
he
watched
over
gervaise
and
virginie
they
always
pretended
to
entertain
a
great
friendship
for
each
other
he
reigned
over
both
blonde
and
brunette
with
the
tranquillity
of
a
pasha
and
fattened
on
his
cunning
the
rogue
was
still
digesting
the
coupeaus
when
he
already
began
to
devour
the
poissons
oh
it
did
not
inconvenience
him
much
as
soon
as
one
shop
was
swallowed
he
started
on
a
second
it
was
only
men
of
his
sort
who
ever
have
any
luck
it
was
in
june
of
that
year
that
nana
was
confirmed
she
was
then
nearly
thirteen
years
old
as
tall
as
an
asparagus
shoot
run
to
seed
and
had
a
bold
impudent
air
about
her
the
year
before
she
had
been
sent
away
from
the
catechism
class
on
account
of
her
bad
behavior
and
the
priest
had
only
allowed
her
to
join
it
this
time
through
fear
of
losing
her
altogether
and
of
casting
one
more
heathen
onto
the
street
nana
danced
for
joy
as
she
thought
of
the
white
dress
the
lorilleuxs
being
godfather
and
godmother
had
promised
to
provide
it
and
took
care
to
let
everyone
in
the
house
know
of
their
present
madame
lerat
was
to
give
the
veil
and
the
cap
virginie
the
purse
and
lantier
the
so
that
the
coupeaus
looked
forward
to
the
ceremony
without
any
great
anxiety
even
the
poissons
wishing
to
give
a
chose
this
occasion
no
doubt
on
the
hatter
advice
they
invited
the
coupeaus
and
the
boches
whose
little
girl
was
also
going
to
be
confirmed
they
provided
a
leg
of
mutton
and
trimmings
for
the
evening
in
question
it
so
happened
that
on
the
evening
before
coupeau
returned
home
in
a
most
abominable
condition
just
as
nana
was
lost
in
admiration
before
the
presents
spread
out
on
the
top
of
the
chest
of
drawers
the
paris
atmosphere
was
getting
the
better
of
him
again
and
he
fell
foul
of
his
wife
and
child
with
drunken
arguments
and
disgusting
language
which
no
one
should
have
uttered
at
such
a
time
nana
herself
was
beginning
to
get
hold
of
some
very
bad
expressions
in
the
midst
of
the
filthy
conversations
she
was
continually
hearing
on
the
days
when
there
was
a
row
she
would
often
call
her
mother
an
old
camel
and
a
cow
where
my
food
yelled
the
i
want
my
soup
you
couple
of
jades
there
females
for
you
always
thinking
of
finery
i
sit
on
the
you
know
if
i
do
get
my
soup
he
unbearable
when
he
drunk
murmured
gervaise
out
of
patience
and
turning
towards
him
she
exclaimed
it
warming
up
do
bother
us
nana
was
being
modest
because
she
thought
it
nice
on
such
a
day
she
continued
to
look
at
the
presents
on
the
chest
of
drawers
affectedly
lowering
her
eyelids
and
pretending
not
to
understand
her
naughty
words
but
the
was
an
awful
plague
on
the
nights
when
he
had
had
too
much
poking
his
face
right
against
her
neck
he
said
i
give
you
white
dresses
so
the
finery
tickles
your
fancy
they
excite
your
imagination
just
you
cut
away
from
there
you
ugly
little
brat
move
your
hands
about
bundle
them
all
into
a
drawer
nana
with
bowed
head
did
not
answer
a
word
she
had
taken
up
the
little
tulle
cap
and
was
asking
her
mother
how
much
it
cost
and
as
coupeau
thrust
out
his
hand
to
seize
hold
of
the
cap
it
was
gervaise
who
pushed
him
aside
exclaiming
do
leave
the
child
alone
she
very
good
she
doing
no
harm
then
the
let
out
in
real
earnest
ah
the
viragos
the
mother
and
daughter
they
make
the
pair
it
a
nice
thing
to
go
to
church
just
to
leer
at
the
men
dare
to
say
it
true
little
slattern
i
dress
you
in
a
sack
just
to
disgust
you
you
and
your
priests
i
do
want
you
to
be
taught
anything
worse
than
you
know
already
dieu
just
listen
to
me
both
of
you
at
this
nana
turned
round
in
a
fury
whilst
gervaise
had
to
spread
out
her
arms
to
protect
the
things
which
coupeau
talked
of
tearing
the
child
looked
her
father
straight
in
the
face
then
forgetting
the
modest
bearing
inculcated
by
her
confessor
she
said
clinching
her
teeth
pig
as
soon
as
the
had
had
his
soup
he
went
off
to
sleep
on
the
morrow
he
awoke
in
a
very
good
humor
he
still
felt
a
little
of
the
booze
of
the
day
before
but
only
just
sufficient
to
make
him
amiable
he
assisted
at
the
dressing
of
the
child
deeply
affected
by
the
white
dress
and
finding
that
a
mere
nothing
gave
the
little
vermin
quite
the
look
of
a
young
lady
the
two
families
started
off
together
for
the
church
nana
and
pauline
walked
first
their
in
their
hands
and
holding
down
their
veils
on
account
of
the
wind
they
did
not
speak
but
were
bursting
with
delight
at
seeing
people
come
to
their
and
they
smiled
primly
and
devoutly
every
time
they
heard
anyone
say
as
they
passed
that
they
looked
very
nice
madame
boche
and
madame
lorilleux
lagged
behind
because
they
were
interchanging
their
ideas
about
a
whose
daughter
would
never
have
been
confirmed
if
the
relations
had
not
found
everything
for
her
yes
everything
even
a
new
chemise
out
of
respect
for
the
holy
altar
madame
lorilleux
was
rather
concerned
about
the
dress
calling
nana
a
dirty
thing
every
time
the
child
got
dust
on
her
skirt
by
brushing
against
the
store
fronts
at
church
coupeau
wept
all
the
time
it
was
stupid
but
he
could
not
help
it
it
affected
him
to
see
the
priest
holding
out
his
arms
and
all
the
little
girls
looking
like
angels
pass
before
him
clasping
their
hands
and
the
music
of
the
organ
stirred
up
his
stomach
and
the
pleasant
smell
of
the
incense
forced
him
to
sniff
the
same
as
though
someone
had
thrust
a
bouquet
of
flowers
into
his
face
in
short
he
saw
everything
cerulean
his
heart
was
touched
anyway
other
sensitive
souls
around
him
were
wetting
their
handkerchiefs
this
was
a
beautiful
day
the
most
beautiful
of
his
life
after
leaving
the
church
coupeau
went
for
a
drink
with
lorilleux
who
had
remained
that
evening
the
poissons
was
very
lively
friendship
reigned
without
a
hitch
from
one
end
of
the
feast
to
the
other
when
bad
times
arrive
one
thus
comes
in
for
some
pleasant
evenings
hours
during
which
sworn
enemies
love
each
other
lantier
with
gervaise
on
his
left
and
virginie
on
his
right
was
most
amiable
to
both
of
them
lavishing
little
tender
caresses
like
a
cock
who
desires
peace
in
his
but
the
queens
of
the
feast
were
the
two
little
ones
nana
and
pauline
who
had
been
allowed
to
keep
on
their
things
they
sat
bolt
upright
through
fear
of
spilling
anything
on
their
white
dresses
and
at
every
mouthful
they
were
told
to
hold
up
their
chins
so
as
to
swallow
cleanly
nana
greatly
bored
by
all
this
fuss
ended
by
slobbering
her
wine
over
the
body
of
her
dress
so
it
was
taken
off
and
the
stains
were
at
once
washed
out
in
a
glass
of
water
then
at
dessert
the
children
future
careers
were
gravely
discussed
madame
boche
had
decided
that
pauline
would
enter
a
shop
to
learn
how
to
punch
designs
on
gold
and
silver
that
paid
five
or
six
francs
a
day
gervaise
did
know
yet
because
nana
had
never
indicated
any
preference
in
your
place
said
madame
lerat
i
would
bring
nana
up
as
an
artificial
it
is
a
pleasant
and
clean
employment
muttered
lorilleux
every
one
of
them
might
as
well
walk
the
streets
well
what
about
me
objected
madame
lerat
pursing
her
lips
certainly
not
very
polite
i
assure
you
that
i
do
lie
down
for
anyone
who
whistles
then
all
the
rest
joined
together
in
hushing
her
madame
lerat
oh
madame
lerat
by
side
glances
they
reminded
her
of
the
two
girls
fresh
from
communion
who
were
burying
their
noses
in
their
glasses
to
keep
from
laughing
out
loud
the
men
had
been
very
careful
for
sake
to
use
only
suitable
language
but
madame
lerat
refused
to
follow
their
example
she
flattered
herself
on
her
command
of
language
as
she
had
often
been
complimented
on
the
way
she
could
say
anything
before
children
without
any
offence
to
decency
just
you
listen
there
are
some
very
fine
women
among
the
she
insisted
they
just
like
other
women
and
they
show
good
taste
when
they
choose
to
commit
a
sin
dieu
interrupted
gervaise
i
no
dislike
for
artificial
only
it
must
please
nana
that
all
i
care
about
one
should
never
thwart
children
on
the
question
of
a
vocation
come
nana
do
be
stupid
tell
me
now
would
you
like
to
make
flowers
the
child
was
leaning
over
her
plate
gathering
up
the
cake
crumbs
with
her
wet
finger
which
she
afterwards
sucked
she
did
not
hurry
herself
she
grinned
in
her
vicious
way
why
yes
mamma
i
should
like
to
she
ended
by
declaring
then
the
matter
was
at
once
settled
coupeau
was
quite
willing
that
madame
lerat
should
take
the
child
with
her
on
the
morrow
to
the
place
where
she
worked
in
the
rue
du
caire
and
they
all
talked
very
gravely
of
the
duties
of
life
boche
said
that
nana
and
pauline
were
women
now
that
they
had
partaken
of
communion
poisson
added
that
for
the
future
they
ought
to
know
how
to
cook
mend
socks
and
look
after
a
house
something
was
even
said
of
their
marrying
and
of
the
children
they
would
some
day
have
the
youngsters
listened
laughing
to
themselves
elated
by
the
thought
of
being
women
what
pleased
them
the
most
was
when
lantier
teased
them
asking
if
they
did
already
have
little
husbands
nana
eventually
admitted
that
she
cared
a
great
deal
for
victor
fauconnier
son
of
her
mother
employer
ah
well
said
madame
lorilleux
to
the
boches
as
they
were
all
leaving
she
our
goddaughter
but
as
they
going
to
put
her
into
artificial
we
do
wish
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
her
just
one
more
for
the
boulevards
she
be
leading
them
a
merry
chase
before
six
months
are
over
on
going
up
to
bed
the
coupeaus
agreed
that
everything
had
passed
off
well
and
that
the
poissons
were
not
at
all
bad
people
gervaise
even
considered
the
shop
was
nicely
got
up
she
was
surprised
to
discover
that
it
had
pained
her
at
all
to
spend
an
evening
there
while
nana
was
getting
ready
for
bed
she
contemplated
her
white
dress
and
asked
her
mother
if
the
young
lady
on
the
third
floor
had
had
one
like
it
when
she
was
married
last
month
this
was
their
last
happy
day
two
years
passed
by
during
which
they
sank
deeper
and
deeper
the
winters
were
especially
hard
for
them
if
they
had
bread
to
eat
during
the
fine
weather
the
rain
and
cold
came
accompanied
by
famine
by
drubbings
before
the
empty
cupboard
and
by
with
nothing
to
eat
in
the
little
siberia
of
their
larder
villainous
december
brought
numbing
freezing
spells
and
the
black
misery
of
cold
and
dampness
the
first
winter
they
occasionally
had
a
fire
choosing
to
keep
warm
rather
than
to
eat
but
the
second
winter
the
stove
stood
mute
with
its
rust
adding
a
chill
to
the
room
standing
there
like
a
gravestone
and
what
took
the
life
out
of
their
limbs
what
above
all
utterly
crushed
them
was
the
rent
oh
the
january
quarter
when
there
was
not
a
radish
in
the
house
and
old
boche
came
up
with
the
bill
it
was
like
a
bitter
storm
a
regular
tempest
from
the
north
monsieur
marescot
then
arrived
the
following
saturday
wrapped
up
in
a
good
warm
overcoat
his
big
hands
hidden
in
woolen
gloves
and
he
was
for
ever
talking
of
turning
them
out
whilst
the
snow
continued
to
fall
outside
as
though
it
were
preparing
a
bed
for
them
on
the
pavement
with
white
sheets
to
have
paid
the
quarter
rent
they
would
have
sold
their
very
flesh
it
was
the
rent
which
emptied
the
larder
and
the
stove
no
doubt
the
coupeaus
had
only
themselves
to
blame
life
may
be
a
hard
fight
but
one
always
pulls
through
when
one
is
orderly
and
economical
witness
the
lorilleuxs
who
paid
their
rent
to
the
day
the
money
folded
up
in
bits
of
dirty
paper
but
they
it
is
true
led
a
life
of
starved
spiders
which
would
disgust
one
with
hard
work
nana
as
yet
earned
nothing
at
she
even
cost
a
good
deal
for
her
keep
at
madame
fauconnier
gervaise
was
beginning
to
be
looked
down
upon
she
was
no
longer
so
expert
she
bungled
her
work
to
such
an
extent
that
the
mistress
had
reduced
her
wages
to
two
francs
a
day
the
price
paid
to
the
clumsiest
bungler
but
she
was
still
proud
reminding
everyone
of
her
former
status
as
boss
of
her
own
shop
when
madame
fauconnier
hired
madame
putois
gervaise
was
so
annoyed
at
having
to
work
beside
her
former
employee
that
she
stayed
away
for
two
weeks
as
for
coupeau
he
did
perhaps
work
but
in
that
case
he
certainly
made
a
present
of
his
labor
to
the
government
for
since
the
time
he
returned
from
etampes
gervaise
had
never
seen
the
color
of
his
money
she
no
longer
looked
in
his
hands
when
he
came
home
on
paydays
he
arrived
swinging
his
arms
his
pockets
empty
and
often
without
his
handkerchief
well
yes
he
had
lost
his
rag
or
else
some
rascally
comrade
had
sneaked
it
at
first
he
always
fibbed
there
was
a
donation
to
charity
or
some
money
slipped
through
the
hole
in
his
pocket
or
he
paid
off
some
imaginary
debts
later
he
did
even
bother
to
make
up
anything
he
had
nothing
left
because
it
had
all
gone
into
his
stomach
madame
boche
suggested
to
gervaise
that
she
go
to
wait
for
him
at
the
shop
exit
this
rarely
worked
though
because
coupeau
comrades
would
warn
him
and
the
money
would
disappear
into
his
shoe
or
someone
pocket
yes
it
was
their
own
fault
if
every
season
found
them
lower
and
lower
but
that
the
sort
of
thing
one
never
tells
oneself
especially
when
one
is
down
in
the
mire
they
accused
their
bad
luck
they
pretended
that
fate
was
against
them
their
home
had
become
a
regular
shambles
where
they
wrangled
the
whole
day
long
however
they
had
not
yet
come
to
blows
with
the
exception
of
a
few
impulsive
smacks
which
somehow
flew
about
at
the
height
of
their
quarrels
the
saddest
part
of
the
business
was
that
they
had
opened
the
cage
of
affection
all
their
better
feelings
had
taken
flight
like
so
many
canaries
the
genial
warmth
of
father
mother
and
child
when
united
together
and
wrapped
up
in
each
other
deserted
them
and
left
them
shivering
each
in
his
or
her
own
corner
all
three
coupeau
gervaise
and
nana
were
always
in
the
most
abominable
tempers
biting
each
other
noses
off
for
nothing
at
all
their
eyes
full
of
hatred
and
it
seemed
as
though
something
had
broken
the
mainspring
of
the
family
the
mechanism
which
with
happy
people
causes
hearts
to
beat
in
unison
ah
it
was
certain
gervaise
was
no
longer
moved
as
she
used
to
be
when
she
saw
coupeau
at
the
edge
of
a
roof
forty
or
fifty
feet
above
the
pavement
she
would
not
have
pushed
him
off
herself
but
if
he
had
fallen
accidentally
in
truth
it
would
have
freed
the
earth
of
one
who
was
of
but
little
account
the
days
when
they
were
more
especially
at
enmity
she
would
ask
him
why
he
did
come
back
on
a
stretcher
she
was
awaiting
it
it
would
be
her
good
luck
they
were
bringing
back
to
her
what
use
was
he
that
drunkard
to
make
her
weep
to
devour
all
she
possessed
to
drive
her
to
sin
well
men
so
useless
as
he
should
be
thrown
as
quickly
as
possible
into
the
hole
and
the
polka
of
deliverance
be
danced
over
them
and
when
the
mother
said
kill
him
the
daughter
responded
knock
him
on
the
head
nana
read
all
of
the
reports
of
accidents
in
the
newspapers
and
made
reflections
that
were
unnatural
for
a
girl
her
father
had
such
good
luck
an
omnibus
had
knocked
him
down
without
even
sobering
him
would
the
beggar
never
croak
in
the
midst
of
her
own
poverty
gervaise
suffered
even
more
because
other
families
around
her
were
also
starving
to
death
their
corner
of
the
tenement
housed
the
most
wretched
there
was
not
a
family
that
ate
every
day
gervaise
felt
the
most
pity
for
pere
bru
in
his
cubbyhole
under
the
staircase
where
he
hibernated
sometimes
he
stayed
on
his
bed
of
straw
without
moving
for
days
even
hunger
no
longer
drove
him
out
since
there
was
no
use
taking
a
walk
when
no
one
would
invite
him
to
dinner
whenever
he
did
show
his
face
for
several
days
the
neighbors
would
push
open
his
door
to
see
if
his
troubles
were
over
no
he
was
still
alive
just
barely
even
death
seemed
to
have
neglected
him
whenever
gervaise
had
any
bread
she
gave
him
the
crusts
even
when
she
hated
all
men
because
of
her
husband
she
still
felt
sincerely
sorry
for
pere
bru
the
poor
old
man
they
were
letting
him
starve
to
death
because
he
could
no
longer
hold
tools
in
his
hand
the
laundress
also
suffered
a
great
deal
from
the
close
neighborhood
of
bazouge
the
undertaker
helper
a
simple
partition
and
a
very
thin
one
separated
the
two
rooms
he
could
not
put
his
fingers
down
his
throat
without
her
hearing
it
as
soon
as
he
came
home
of
an
evening
she
listened
in
spite
of
herself
to
everything
he
did
his
black
leather
hat
laid
with
a
dull
thud
on
the
chest
of
drawers
like
a
shovelful
of
earth
the
black
cloak
hung
up
and
rustling
against
the
walls
like
the
wings
of
some
night
bird
all
the
black
toggery
flung
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
filling
it
with
the
trappings
of
mourning
she
heard
him
stamping
about
felt
anxious
at
the
least
movement
and
was
quite
startled
if
he
knocked
against
the
furniture
or
rattled
any
of
his
crockery
this
confounded
drunkard
was
her
preoccupation
filling
her
with
a
secret
fear
mingled
with
a
desire
to
know
he
jolly
his
belly
full
every
day
his
head
all
upside
down
coughed
spat
sang
mother
godichon
made
use
of
many
dirty
expressions
and
fought
with
the
four
walls
before
finding
his
bedstead
and
she
remained
quite
pale
wondering
what
he
could
be
doing
in
there
she
imagined
the
most
atrocious
things
she
got
into
her
head
that
he
must
have
brought
a
corpse
home
and
was
stowing
it
away
under
his
bedstead
well
the
newspapers
had
related
something
of
the
kind
an
undertaker
helper
who
collected
the
coffins
of
little
children
at
his
home
so
as
to
save
himself
trouble
and
to
make
only
one
journey
to
the
cemetery
for
certain
directly
bazouge
arrived
a
smell
of
death
seemed
to
permeate
the
partition
one
might
have
thought
oneself
lodging
against
the
pere
lachaise
cemetery
in
the
midst
of
the
kingdom
of
moles
he
was
frightful
the
animal
continually
laughing
all
by
himself
as
though
his
profession
enlivened
him
even
when
he
had
finished
his
rumpus
and
had
laid
himself
on
his
back
he
snored
in
a
manner
so
extraordinary
that
it
caused
the
laundress
to
hold
her
breath
for
hours
she
listened
attentively
with
an
idea
that
funerals
were
passing
through
her
neighbor
room
the
worst
was
that
in
spite
of
her
terrors
something
incited
gervaise
to
put
her
ear
to
the
wall
the
better
to
find
out
what
was
taking
place
bazouge
had
the
same
effect
on
her
as
handsome
men
have
on
good
women
they
would
like
to
touch
them
well
if
fear
had
not
kept
her
back
gervaise
would
have
liked
to
have
handled
death
to
see
what
it
was
like
she
became
so
peculiar
at
times
holding
her
breath
listening
attentively
expecting
to
unravel
the
secret
through
one
of
movements
that
coupeau
would
ask
her
with
a
chuckle
if
she
had
a
fancy
for
that
gravedigger
next
door
she
got
angry
and
talked
of
moving
the
close
proximity
of
this
neighbor
was
so
distasteful
to
her
and
yet
in
spite
of
herself
as
soon
as
the
old
chap
arrived
smelling
like
a
cemetery
she
became
wrapped
again
in
her
reflections
with
the
excited
and
timorous
air
of
a
wife
thinking
of
passing
a
knife
through
the
marriage
contract
had
he
not
twice
offered
to
pack
her
up
and
carry
her
off
with
him
to
some
place
where
the
enjoyment
of
sleep
is
so
great
that
in
a
moment
one
forgets
all
one
wretchedness
perhaps
it
was
really
very
pleasant
little
by
little
the
temptation
to
taste
it
became
stronger
she
would
have
liked
to
have
tried
it
for
a
fortnight
or
a
month
oh
to
sleep
a
month
especially
in
winter
the
month
when
the
rent
became
due
when
the
troubles
of
life
were
killing
her
but
it
was
not
possible
one
must
sleep
forever
if
one
commences
to
sleep
for
an
hour
and
the
thought
of
this
froze
her
her
desire
for
death
departed
before
the
eternal
and
stern
friendship
which
the
earth
demanded
however
one
evening
in
january
she
knocked
with
both
her
fists
against
the
partition
she
had
passed
a
frightful
week
hustled
by
everyone
without
a
sou
and
utterly
discouraged
that
evening
she
was
not
at
all
well
she
shivered
with
fever
and
seemed
to
see
flames
dancing
about
her
then
instead
of
throwing
herself
out
of
the
window
as
she
had
at
one
moment
thought
of
doing
she
set
to
knocking
and
calling
old
bazouge
old
bazouge
the
undertaker
helper
was
taking
off
his
shoes
and
singing
there
were
three
lovely
girls
he
had
probably
had
a
good
day
for
he
seemed
even
more
maudlin
than
usual
old
bazouge
old
bazouge
repeated
gervaise
raising
her
voice
did
he
not
hear
her
then
she
was
ready
to
give
herself
at
once
he
might
come
and
take
her
on
his
neck
and
carry
her
off
to
the
place
where
he
carried
his
other
women
the
poor
and
the
rich
whom
he
consoled
it
pained
her
to
hear
his
song
there
were
three
lovely
girls
because
she
discerned
in
it
the
disdain
of
a
man
with
too
many
sweethearts
what
is
it
what
is
it
stuttered
bazouge
who
unwell
coming
little
woman
but
the
sound
of
this
husky
voice
awoke
gervaise
as
though
from
a
nightmare
and
a
feeling
of
horror
ascended
from
her
knees
to
her
shoulders
at
the
thought
of
seeing
herself
lugged
along
in
the
old
fellow
arms
all
stiff
and
her
face
as
white
as
a
china
plate
well
is
there
no
one
there
now
resumed
bazouge
in
silence
wait
a
bit
we
always
ready
to
oblige
the
ladies
it
nothing
nothing
said
the
laundress
at
length
in
a
choking
voice
i
do
require
anything
thanks
she
remained
anxious
listening
to
old
bazouge
grumbling
himself
to
sleep
afraid
to
stir
for
fear
he
would
think
he
heard
her
knocking
again
in
her
corner
of
misery
in
the
midst
of
her
cares
and
the
cares
of
others
gervaise
had
however
a
beautiful
example
of
courage
in
the
home
of
her
neighbors
the
bijards
little
lalie
only
eight
years
old
and
no
larger
than
a
sparrow
took
care
of
the
household
as
competently
as
a
grown
person
the
job
was
not
an
easy
one
because
she
had
two
little
tots
her
brother
jules
and
her
sister
henriette
aged
three
and
five
to
watch
all
day
long
while
sweeping
and
cleaning
ever
since
bijard
had
killed
his
wife
with
a
kick
in
the
stomach
lalie
had
become
the
little
mother
of
them
all
without
saying
a
word
and
of
her
own
accord
she
filled
the
place
of
one
who
had
gone
to
the
extent
that
her
brute
of
a
father
no
doubt
to
complete
the
resemblance
now
belabored
the
daughter
as
he
had
formerly
belabored
the
mother
whenever
he
came
home
drunk
he
required
a
woman
to
massacre
he
did
not
even
notice
that
lalie
was
quite
little
he
would
not
have
beaten
some
old
trollop
harder
little
lalie
so
thin
it
made
you
cry
took
it
all
without
a
word
of
complaint
in
her
beautiful
patient
eyes
never
would
she
revolt
she
bent
her
neck
to
protect
her
face
and
stifled
her
sobs
so
as
not
to
alarm
the
neighbors
when
her
father
got
tired
of
kicking
her
she
would
rest
a
bit
until
she
got
her
strength
back
and
then
resume
her
work
it
was
part
of
her
job
being
beaten
daily
gervaise
entertained
a
great
friendship
for
her
little
neighbor
she
treated
her
as
an
equal
as
a
woman
of
experience
it
must
be
said
that
lalie
had
a
pale
and
serious
look
with
the
expression
of
an
old
girl
one
might
have
thought
her
thirty
on
hearing
her
speak
she
knew
very
well
how
to
buy
things
mend
the
clothes
attend
to
the
home
and
she
spoke
of
the
children
as
though
she
had
already
gone
through
two
or
thee
nurseries
in
her
time
it
made
people
smile
to
hear
her
talk
thus
at
eight
years
old
and
then
a
lump
would
rise
in
their
throats
and
they
would
hurry
away
so
as
not
to
burst
out
crying
gervaise
drew
the
child
towards
her
as
much
as
she
could
gave
her
all
she
could
spare
of
food
and
old
clothing
one
day
as
she
tried
one
of
nana
old
dresses
on
her
she
almost
choked
with
anger
on
seeing
her
back
covered
with
bruises
the
skin
off
her
elbow
which
was
still
bleeding
and
all
her
innocent
flesh
martyred
and
sticking
to
her
bones
well
old
bazouge
could
get
a
box
ready
she
would
not
last
long
at
that
rate
but
the
child
had
begged
the
laundress
not
to
say
a
word
she
would
not
have
her
father
bothered
on
her
account
she
took
his
part
affirming
that
he
would
not
have
been
so
wicked
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
drink
he
was
mad
he
did
not
know
what
he
did
oh
she
forgave
him
because
one
ought
to
forgive
madmen
everything
from
that
time
gervaise
watched
and
prepared
to
interfere
directly
she
heard
bijard
coming
up
the
stairs
but
on
most
of
the
occasions
she
only
caught
some
whack
for
her
trouble
when
she
entered
their
room
in
the
she
often
found
lalie
tied
to
the
foot
of
the
iron
bedstead
it
was
an
idea
of
the
locksmith
before
going
out
to
tie
her
legs
and
her
body
with
some
stout
rope
without
anyone
being
able
to
find
out
why
a
mere
whim
of
a
brain
diseased
by
drink
just
for
the
sake
no
doubt
of
maintaining
his
tyranny
over
the
child
when
he
was
no
longer
there
lalie
as
stiff
as
a
stake
with
pins
and
needles
in
her
legs
remained
whole
days
at
the
post
she
once
even
passed
a
night
there
bijard
having
forgotten
to
come
home
whenever
gervaise
carried
away
by
her
indignation
talked
of
unfastening
her
she
implored
her
not
to
disturb
the
rope
because
her
father
became
furious
if
he
did
not
find
the
knots
tied
the
same
way
he
had
left
them
really
it
was
so
bad
it
gave
her
a
rest
she
smiled
as
she
said
this
though
her
legs
were
swollen
and
bruised
what
upset
her
the
most
was
that
she
could
do
her
work
while
tied
to
the
bed
she
could
watch
the
children
though
and
even
did
some
knitting
so
as
not
to
entirely
waste
the
time
the
locksmith
had
thought
of
another
little
game
too
he
heated
sous
in
the
frying
pan
then
placed
them
on
a
corner
of
the
and
he
called
lalie
and
told
her
to
fetch
a
couple
of
pounds
of
bread
the
child
took
up
the
sous
unsuspectingly
uttered
a
cry
and
threw
them
on
the
ground
shaking
her
burnt
hand
then
he
flew
into
a
fury
who
had
saddled
him
with
such
a
piece
of
carrion
she
lost
the
money
now
and
he
threatened
to
beat
her
to
a
jelly
if
she
did
not
pick
the
sous
up
at
once
when
the
child
hesitated
she
received
the
first
warning
a
clout
of
such
force
that
it
made
her
see
candles
speechless
and
with
two
big
tears
in
the
corners
of
her
eyes
she
would
pick
up
the
sous
and
go
off
tossing
them
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
to
cool
them
no
one
could
never
imagine
the
ferocious
ideas
which
may
sprout
from
the
depths
of
a
drunkard
brain
one
afternoon
for
instance
lalie
having
made
everything
tidy
was
playing
with
the
children
the
window
was
open
there
was
a
draught
and
the
wind
blowing
along
the
passage
gently
shook
the
door
it
monsieur
hardy
the
child
was
saying
come
in
monsieur
hardy
pray
have
the
kindness
to
walk
in
and
she
curtsied
before
the
door
she
bowed
to
the
wind
henriette
and
jules
behind
her
also
bowed
delighted
with
the
game
and
splitting
their
sides
with
laughing
as
though
being
tickled
she
was
quite
rosy
at
seeing
them
so
heartily
amused
and
even
found
some
pleasure
in
it
on
her
own
account
which
generally
only
happened
to
her
on
the
day
of
each
month
good
day
monsieur
hardy
how
do
you
do
monsieur
hardy
but
a
rough
hand
pushed
open
the
door
and
bijard
entered
then
the
scene
changed
henriette
and
jules
fell
down
flat
against
the
wall
whilst
lalie
terrified
remained
standing
in
the
very
middle
of
the
curtsey
the
locksmith
held
in
his
hand
a
big
waggoner
whip
quite
new
with
a
long
white
wooden
handle
and
a
leather
thong
terminating
with
a
bit
of
he
placed
the
whip
in
the
corner
against
the
bed
and
did
not
give
the
usual
kick
to
the
child
who
was
already
preparing
herself
by
presenting
her
back
a
chuckle
exposed
his
blackened
teeth
and
he
was
very
lively
very
drunk
his
red
face
lighted
up
by
some
idea
that
amused
him
immensely
what
that
said
he
you
playing
the
deuce
eh
you
confounded
young
hussy
i
could
hear
you
dancing
about
from
downstairs

to
sniff
you
from
behind

i
touching
you
that
you
tremble
like
a
mass
of
giblets
take
my
shoes
off
lalie
turned
quite
pale
again
and
amazed
at
not
receiving
her
usual
drubbing
took
his
shoes
off
he
had
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
he
lay
down
with
his
clothes
on
and
remained
with
his
eyes
open
watching
the
child
move
about
the
room
she
busied
herself
with
one
thing
and
another
gradually
becoming
bewildered
beneath
his
glance
her
limbs
overcome
by
such
a
fright
that
she
ended
by
breaking
a
cup
then
without
getting
off
the
bed
he
took
hold
of
the
whip
and
showed
it
to
her
see
little
chickie
look
at
this
it
a
present
for
you

fifty
sous

into
the
corners

have
a
try
ah

broke
a
cup
now
then
gee
up
dance
away
make
your
curtsies
to
monsieur
hardy
he
did
not
even
raise
himself
but
lay
sprawling
on
his
back
his
head
buried
in
his
pillow
making
the
big
whip
crack
about
the
room
with
the
noise
of
a
postillion
starting
his
horses
then
lowering
his
arm
he
lashed
lalie
in
the
middle
of
the
body
encircling
her
with
the
whip
and
unwinding
it
again
as
though
she
were
a
top
she
fell
and
tried
to
escape
on
her
hands
and
knees
but
lashing
her
again
he
jerked
her
to
her
feet
gee
up
gee
up
yelled
he
it
the
donkey
race
eh
it
be
fine
of
a
cold
morning
in
winter
i
can
lie
snug
without
getting
cold
or
hurting
my
chilblains
and
catch
the
calves
from
a
distance
in
that
corner
there
a
hit
you
hussy
and
in
that
other
corner
a
hit

and
in
that
one

hit
ah

crawl
under
the
bed
i
whack

with
the
handle
gee
up
you
jade
gee
up
gee
up
a
slight
foam
came
to
his
lips
his
yellow
eyes
were
starting
from
their
black
orbits
lalie
maddened
howling
jumped
to
the
four
corners
of
the
room
curled
herself
up
on
the
floor
and
clung
to
the
walls
but
the
lash
at
the
end
of
the
big
whip
caught
her
everywhere
cracking
against
her
ears
with
the
noise
of
fireworks
streaking
her
flesh
with
burning
weals
a
regular
dance
of
the
animal
being
taught
its
tricks
this
poor
kitten
waltzed
it
was
a
sight
her
heels
in
the
air
like
little
girls
playing
at
skipping
and
crying
father
she
was
all
out
of
breath
rebounding
like
an
ball
letting
herself
be
beaten
unable
to
see
or
any
longer
to
seek
a
refuge
and
her
wolf
of
a
father
triumphed
calling
her
a
virago
asking
her
if
she
had
had
enough
and
whether
she
understood
sufficiently
that
she
was
in
future
to
give
up
all
hope
of
escaping
from
him
but
gervaise
suddenly
entered
the
room
attracted
by
the
child
howls
on
beholding
such
a
scene
she
was
seized
with
a
furious
indignation
ah
you
brute
of
a
man
cried
she
leave
her
alone
you
brigand
put
the
police
on
to
you
bijard
growled
like
an
animal
being
disturbed
and
stuttered
mind
your
own
business
a
bit
limper
perhaps
you
like
me
to
put
gloves
on
when
i
stir
her
up
it
merely
to
warm
her
as
you
can
plainly
see
simply
to
show
her
that
i
a
long
arm
and
he
gave
a
final
lash
with
the
whip
which
caught
lalie
across
the
face
the
upper
lip
was
cut
the
blood
flowed
gervaise
had
seized
a
chair
and
was
about
to
fall
on
to
the
locksmith
but
the
child
held
her
hands
towards
her
imploringly
saying
that
it
was
nothing
and
that
it
was
all
over
she
wiped
away
the
blood
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
and
quieted
the
babies
who
were
sobbing
bitterly
as
though
they
had
received
all
the
blows
whenever
gervaise
thought
of
lalie
she
felt
she
had
no
right
to
complain
for
herself
she
wished
she
had
as
much
patient
courage
as
the
little
girl
who
was
only
eight
years
old
and
had
to
endure
more
than
the
rest
of
the
women
on
their
staircase
put
together
she
had
seen
lalie
living
on
stale
bread
for
months
and
growing
thinner
and
weaker
whenever
she
smuggled
some
remnants
of
meat
to
lalie
it
almost
broke
her
heart
to
see
the
child
weeping
silently
and
nibbling
it
down
only
by
little
bits
because
her
throat
was
so
shrunken
gervaise
looked
on
lalie
as
a
model
of
suffering
and
forgiveness
and
tried
to
learn
from
her
how
to
suffer
in
silence
in
the
coupeau
household
the
vitriol
of
was
also
commencing
its
ravages
gervaise
could
see
the
day
coming
when
her
husband
would
get
a
whip
like
bijard
to
make
her
dance
yes
coupeau
was
spinning
an
evil
thread
the
time
was
past
when
a
drink
would
make
him
feel
good
his
unhealthy
soft
fat
of
earlier
years
had
melted
away
and
he
was
beginning
to
wither
and
turn
a
leaden
grey
he
seemed
to
have
a
greenish
tint
like
a
corpse
putrefying
in
a
pond
he
no
longer
had
a
taste
for
food
not
even
the
most
beautifully
prepared
stew
his
stomach
would
turn
and
his
decayed
teeth
refuse
to
touch
it
a
pint
a
day
was
his
daily
ration
the
only
nourishment
he
could
digest
when
he
awoke
in
the
mornings
he
sat
coughing
and
spitting
up
bile
for
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
never
failed
you
might
as
well
have
the
basin
ready
he
was
never
steady
on
his
pins
till
after
his
first
glass
of
consolation
a
real
remedy
the
fire
of
which
cauterized
his
bowels
but
during
the
day
his
strength
returned
at
first
he
would
feel
a
tickling
sensation
a
sort
of
in
his
hands
and
feet
and
he
would
joke
relating
that
someone
was
having
a
lark
with
him
that
he
was
sure
his
wife
put
between
the
sheets
then
his
legs
would
become
heavy
the
tickling
sensation
would
end
by
turning
into
the
most
abominable
cramps
which
gripped
his
flesh
as
though
in
a
vise
that
though
did
not
amuse
him
so
much
he
no
longer
laughed
he
stopped
suddenly
on
the
pavement
in
a
bewildered
way
with
a
ringing
in
his
ears
and
his
eyes
blinded
with
sparks
everything
appeared
to
him
to
be
yellow
the
houses
danced
and
he
reeled
about
for
three
seconds
with
the
fear
of
suddenly
finding
himself
sprawling
on
the
ground
at
other
times
while
the
sun
was
shining
full
on
his
back
he
would
shiver
as
though
iced
water
had
been
poured
down
his
shoulders
what
bothered
him
the
most
was
a
slight
trembling
of
both
his
hands
the
right
hand
especially
must
have
been
guilty
of
some
crime
it
suffered
from
so
many
nightmares
dieu
was
he
then
no
longer
a
man
he
was
becoming
an
old
woman
he
furiously
strained
his
muscles
he
seized
hold
of
his
glass
and
bet
that
he
would
hold
it
perfectly
steady
as
with
a
hand
of
marble
but
in
spite
of
his
efforts
the
glass
danced
about
jumped
to
the
right
jumped
to
the
left
with
a
hurried
and
regular
trembling
movement
then
in
a
fury
he
emptied
it
into
his
gullet
yelling
that
he
would
require
dozens
like
it
and
afterwards
he
undertook
to
carry
a
cask
without
so
much
as
moving
a
finger
gervaise
on
the
other
hand
told
him
to
give
up
drink
if
he
wished
to
cease
trembling
and
he
laughed
at
her
emptying
quarts
until
he
experienced
the
sensation
again
flying
into
a
rage
and
accusing
the
passing
omnibuses
of
shaking
up
his
liquor
in
the
month
of
march
coupeau
returned
home
one
evening
soaked
through
he
had
come
with
from
montrouge
where
they
had
stuffed
themselves
full
of
eel
soup
and
he
had
received
the
full
force
of
the
shower
all
the
way
from
the
barriere
des
fourneaux
to
the
barriere
poissonniere
a
good
distance
during
the
night
he
was
seized
with
a
confounded
fit
of
coughing
he
was
very
flushed
suffering
from
a
violent
fever
and
panting
like
a
broken
bellows
when
the
boches
doctor
saw
him
in
the
morning
and
listened
against
his
back
he
shook
his
head
and
drew
gervaise
aside
to
advise
her
to
have
her
husband
taken
to
the
hospital
coupeau
was
suffering
from
pneumonia
gervaise
did
not
worry
herself
you
may
be
sure
at
one
time
she
would
have
been
chopped
into
pieces
before
trusting
her
old
man
to
the
after
the
accident
in
the
rue
de
la
nation
she
had
spent
their
savings
in
nursing
him
but
those
beautiful
sentiments
do
last
when
men
take
to
wallowing
in
the
mire
no
no
she
did
not
intend
to
make
a
fuss
like
that
again
they
might
take
him
and
never
bring
him
back
she
would
thank
them
heartily
yet
when
the
litter
arrived
and
coupeau
was
put
into
it
like
an
article
of
furniture
she
became
all
pale
and
bit
her
lips
and
if
she
grumbled
and
still
said
it
was
a
good
job
her
heart
was
no
longer
in
her
words
had
she
but
ten
francs
in
her
drawer
she
would
not
have
let
him
go
she
accompanied
him
to
the
lariboisiere
hospital
saw
the
nurses
put
him
to
bed
at
the
end
of
a
long
hall
where
the
patients
in
a
row
looking
like
corpses
raised
themselves
up
and
followed
with
their
eyes
the
comrade
who
had
just
been
brought
in
it
was
a
veritable
death
chamber
there
was
a
suffocating
feverish
odor
and
a
chorus
of
coughing
the
long
hall
gave
the
impression
of
a
small
cemetery
with
its
double
row
of
white
beds
looking
like
an
aisle
of
marble
tombs
when
coupeau
remained
motionless
on
his
pillow
gervaise
left
having
nothing
to
say
nor
anything
in
her
pocket
that
could
comfort
him
outside
she
turned
to
look
up
at
the
monumental
structure
of
the
hospital
and
recalled
the
days
when
coupeau
was
working
there
putting
on
the
zinc
roof
perched
up
high
and
singing
in
the
sun
he
drinking
in
those
days
she
used
to
watch
for
him
from
her
window
in
the
hotel
boncoeur
and
they
would
both
wave
their
handkerchiefs
in
greeting
now
instead
of
being
on
the
roof
like
a
cheerful
sparrow
he
was
down
below
he
had
built
his
own
place
in
the
hospital
where
he
had
come
to
die
dieu
it
all
seemed
so
far
way
now
that
time
of
young
love
on
the
day
after
the
morrow
when
gervaise
called
to
obtain
news
of
him
she
found
the
bed
empty
a
sister
of
charity
told
her
that
they
had
been
obliged
to
remove
her
husband
to
the
asylum
of
because
the
day
before
he
had
suddenly
gone
wild
oh
a
total
of
his
senses
attempts
to
crack
his
skull
against
the
wall
howls
which
prevented
the
other
patients
from
sleeping
it
all
came
from
drink
it
seemed
gervaise
went
home
very
upset
well
her
husband
had
gone
crazy
what
would
it
be
like
if
he
came
home
nana
insisted
that
they
should
leave
him
in
the
hospital
because
he
might
end
by
killing
both
of
them
gervaise
was
not
able
to
go
to
until
sunday
it
was
a
tremendous
journey
fortunately
the
omnibus
from
the
boulevard
rochechouart
to
la
glaciere
passed
close
to
the
asylum
she
went
down
the
rue
de
la
sante
buying
two
oranges
on
her
way
so
as
not
to
arrive
it
was
another
monumental
building
with
grey
courtyards
interminable
corridors
and
a
smell
of
rank
medicaments
which
did
not
exactly
inspire
liveliness
but
when
they
had
admitted
her
into
a
cell
she
was
quite
surprised
to
see
coupeau
almost
jolly
he
was
just
then
seated
on
the
throne
a
spotlessly
clean
wooden
case
and
they
both
laughed
at
her
finding
him
in
this
position
well
one
knows
what
an
invalid
is
he
squatted
there
like
a
pope
with
his
cheek
of
earlier
days
oh
he
was
better
as
he
could
do
this
and
the
pneumonia
inquired
the
laundress
done
for
replied
he
they
cured
it
in
no
time
i
still
cough
a
little
but
that
all
that
is
left
of
it
then
at
the
moment
of
leaving
the
throne
to
get
back
into
his
bed
he
joked
once
more
it
lucky
you
have
a
strong
nose
and
are
not
bothered
they
laughed
louder
than
ever
at
heart
they
felt
joyful
it
was
by
way
of
showing
their
contentment
without
a
host
of
phrases
that
they
thus
joked
together
one
must
have
had
to
do
with
patients
to
know
the
pleasure
one
feels
at
seeing
all
their
functions
at
work
again
when
he
was
back
in
bed
she
gave
him
the
two
oranges
and
this
filled
him
with
emotion
he
was
becoming
quite
nice
again
ever
since
he
had
had
nothing
but
tisane
to
drink
she
ended
by
venturing
to
speak
to
him
about
his
violent
attack
surprised
at
hearing
him
reason
like
in
the
good
old
times
ah
yes
said
he
joking
at
his
own
expense
i
talked
a
precious
lot
of
nonsense
just
fancy
i
saw
rats
and
ran
about
on
all
fours
to
put
a
grain
of
salt
under
their
tails
and
you
you
called
to
me
men
were
trying
to
kill
you
in
short
all
sorts
of
stupid
things
ghosts
in
broad
daylight
oh
i
remember
it
well
my
noodle
still
solid
now
it
over
i
dream
a
bit
when
i
asleep
i
have
nightmares
but
everyone
has
nightmares
gervaise
remained
with
him
until
the
evening
when
the
house
surgeon
came
at
the
six
inspection
he
made
him
spread
his
hands
they
hardly
trembled
at
all
scarcely
a
quiver
at
the
tips
of
the
fingers
however
as
night
approached
coupeau
was
little
by
little
seized
with
uneasiness
he
twice
sat
up
in
bed
looking
on
the
ground
and
in
the
dark
corners
of
the
room
suddenly
he
thrust
out
an
arm
and
appeared
to
crush
some
vermin
against
the
wall
what
is
it
asked
gervaise
frightened
the
rats
the
rats
murmured
he
then
after
a
pause
gliding
into
sleep
he
tossed
about
uttering
disconnected
phrases
dieu
they
tearing
my
skin
oh
the
filthy
beasts
keep
steady
hold
your
skirts
right
round
you
beware
of
the
dirty
bloke
behind
you
dieu
she
down
and
the
scoundrels
laugh
scoundrels
blackguards
brigands
he
dealt
blows
into
space
caught
hold
of
his
blanket
and
rolled
it
into
a
bundle
against
his
chest
as
though
to
protect
the
latter
from
the
violence
of
the
bearded
men
whom
he
beheld
then
an
attendant
having
hastened
to
the
spot
gervaise
withdrew
quite
frozen
by
the
scene
but
when
she
returned
a
few
days
later
she
found
coupeau
completely
cured
even
the
nightmares
had
left
him
he
could
sleep
his
ten
hours
right
off
as
peacefully
as
a
child
and
without
stirring
a
limb
so
his
wife
was
allowed
to
take
him
away
the
house
surgeon
gave
him
the
usual
good
advice
on
leaving
and
advised
him
to
follow
it
if
he
recommenced
drinking
he
would
again
collapse
and
would
end
by
dying
yes
it
solely
depended
upon
himself
he
had
seen
how
jolly
and
healthy
one
could
become
when
one
did
not
get
drunk
well
he
must
continue
at
home
the
sensible
life
he
had
led
at
fancy
himself
under
lock
and
key
and
that
no
longer
existed
the
gentleman
right
said
gervaise
in
the
omnibus
which
was
taking
them
back
to
the
rue
de
la
of
course
he
right
replied
coupeau
then
after
thinking
a
minute
he
resumed
oh
you
know
a
little
glass
now
and
again
ca
kill
a
man
it
helps
the
digestion
and
that
very
evening
he
swallowed
a
glass
of
bad
spirit
just
to
keep
his
stomach
in
order
for
eight
days
he
was
pretty
reasonable
he
was
a
great
coward
at
heart
he
had
no
desire
to
end
his
days
in
the
bicetre
but
his
passion
got
the
better
of
him
the
first
little
glass
led
him
in
spite
of
himself
to
a
second
to
a
third
and
to
a
fourth
and
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
he
had
got
back
to
his
old
ration
a
pint
of
vitriol
a
day
gervaise
exasperated
could
have
beaten
him
to
think
that
she
had
been
stupid
enough
to
dream
once
more
of
leading
a
worthy
life
just
because
she
had
seen
him
at
the
asylum
in
full
possession
of
his
good
sense
another
joyful
hour
had
flown
the
last
one
no
doubt
oh
now
as
nothing
could
reclaim
him
not
even
the
fear
of
his
near
death
she
swore
she
would
no
longer
put
herself
out
the
home
might
be
all
at
sixes
and
sevens
she
did
not
care
any
longer
and
she
talked
also
of
leaving
him
then
hell
upon
earth
recommenced
a
life
sinking
deeper
into
the
mire
without
a
glimmer
of
hope
for
something
better
to
follow
nana
whenever
her
father
clouted
her
furiously
asked
why
the
brute
was
not
at
the
hospital
she
was
awaiting
the
time
when
she
would
be
earning
money
she
would
say
to
treat
him
to
brandy
and
make
him
croak
quicker
gervaise
on
her
side
flew
into
a
passion
one
day
that
coupeau
was
regretting
their
marriage
ah
she
had
brought
him
her
saucy
children
ah
she
had
got
herself
picked
up
from
the
pavement
wheedling
him
with
rosy
dreams
dieu
he
had
a
rare
cheek
so
many
words
so
many
lies
she
wished
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
that
was
the
truth
he
had
dragged
himself
at
her
feet
to
make
her
give
way
whilst
she
was
advising
him
to
think
well
what
he
was
about
and
if
it
was
all
to
come
over
again
he
would
hear
how
she
would
just
say
no
she
would
sooner
have
an
arm
cut
off
yes
she
had
a
lover
before
him
but
a
woman
who
has
had
a
lover
and
who
is
a
worker
is
worth
more
than
a
sluggard
of
a
man
who
sullies
his
honor
and
that
of
his
family
in
all
the
that
day
for
the
first
time
the
coupeaus
went
in
for
a
general
brawl
and
they
whacked
each
other
so
hard
that
an
old
umbrella
and
the
broom
were
broken
gervaise
kept
her
word
she
sank
lower
and
lower
she
missed
going
to
her
work
oftener
spent
whole
days
in
gossiping
and
became
as
soft
as
a
rag
whenever
she
had
a
task
to
perform
if
a
thing
fell
from
her
hands
it
might
remain
on
the
floor
it
was
certainly
not
she
who
would
have
stooped
to
pick
it
up
she
took
her
ease
about
everything
and
never
handled
a
broom
except
when
the
accumulation
of
filth
almost
brought
her
to
the
ground
the
lorilleuxs
now
made
a
point
of
holding
something
to
their
noses
whenever
they
passed
her
room
the
stench
was
poisonous
said
they
those
hypocrites
slyly
lived
at
the
end
of
the
passage
out
of
the
way
of
all
these
miseries
which
filled
the
corner
of
the
house
with
whimpering
locking
themselves
in
so
as
not
to
have
to
lend
twenty
sou
pieces
oh
folks
neighbors
awfully
obliging
yes
you
may
be
sure
one
had
only
to
knock
and
ask
for
a
light
or
a
pinch
of
salt
or
a
jug
of
water
one
was
certain
of
getting
the
door
banged
in
one
face
with
all
that
they
had
vipers
tongues
they
protested
everywhere
that
they
never
occupied
themselves
with
other
people
this
was
true
whenever
it
was
a
question
of
assisting
a
neighbor
but
they
did
so
from
morning
to
night
directly
they
had
a
chance
of
pulling
any
one
to
pieces
with
the
door
bolted
and
a
rug
hung
up
to
cover
the
chinks
and
the
they
would
treat
themselves
to
a
spiteful
gossip
without
leaving
their
gold
wire
for
a
moment
the
fall
of
in
particular
kept
them
purring
like
pet
cats
completely
ruined
not
a
sou
remaining
they
smiled
gleefully
at
the
small
piece
of
bread
she
would
bring
back
when
she
went
shopping
and
kept
count
of
the
days
when
she
had
nothing
at
all
to
eat
and
the
clothes
she
wore
now
disgusting
rags
that
what
happened
when
one
tried
to
live
high
gervaise
who
had
an
idea
of
the
way
in
which
they
spoke
of
her
would
take
her
shoes
off
and
place
her
ear
against
their
door
but
the
rug
over
the
door
prevented
her
from
hearing
much
she
was
heartily
sick
of
them
she
continued
to
speak
to
them
to
avoid
remarks
though
expecting
nothing
but
unpleasantness
from
such
nasty
persons
but
no
longer
having
strength
even
to
give
them
as
much
as
they
gave
her
passed
the
insults
off
as
a
lot
of
nonsense
and
besides
she
only
wanted
her
own
pleasure
to
sit
in
a
heap
twirling
her
thumbs
and
only
moving
when
it
was
a
question
of
amusing
herself
nothing
more
one
saturday
coupeau
had
promised
to
take
her
to
the
circus
it
was
well
worth
while
disturbing
oneself
to
see
ladies
galloping
along
on
horses
and
jumping
through
paper
hoops
coupeau
had
just
finished
a
work
he
could
well
spare
a
couple
of
francs
and
they
had
also
arranged
to
dine
out
just
the
two
of
them
nana
having
to
work
very
late
that
evening
at
her
employer
because
of
some
pressing
order
but
at
seven
there
was
no
coupeau
at
eight
it
was
still
the
same
gervaise
was
furious
her
drunkard
was
certainly
squandering
his
earnings
with
his
comrades
at
the
of
the
neighborhood
she
had
washed
a
cap
and
had
been
slaving
since
the
morning
over
the
holes
of
an
old
dress
wishing
to
look
decent
at
last
towards
nine
her
stomach
empty
her
face
purple
with
rage
she
decided
to
go
down
and
look
for
coupeau
is
it
your
husband
you
want
called
madame
boche
on
catching
sight
of
gervaise
looking
very
glum
he
at
pere
colombe
boche
has
just
been
having
some
cherry
brandy
with
him
gervaise
uttered
her
thanks
and
stalked
stiffly
along
the
pavement
with
the
determination
of
flying
at
coupeau
eyes
a
fine
rain
was
falling
which
made
the
walk
more
unpleasant
still
but
when
she
reached
the
fear
of
receiving
the
drubbing
herself
if
she
badgered
her
old
man
suddenly
calmed
her
and
made
her
prudent
the
shop
was
ablaze
with
the
lighted
gas
the
flames
of
which
were
as
brilliant
as
suns
and
the
bottles
and
jars
illuminated
the
walls
with
their
colored
glass
she
stood
there
an
instant
stretching
her
neck
her
eyes
close
to
the
window
looking
between
two
bottle
placed
there
for
show
watching
coupeau
who
was
right
at
the
back
he
was
sitting
with
some
comrades
at
a
little
zinc
table
all
looking
vague
and
blue
in
the
tobacco
smoke
and
as
one
could
not
hear
them
yelling
it
created
a
funny
effect
to
see
them
gesticulating
with
their
chins
thrust
forward
and
their
eyes
starting
out
of
their
heads
good
heavens
was
it
really
possible
that
men
could
leave
their
wives
and
their
homes
to
shut
themselves
up
thus
in
a
hole
where
they
were
choking
the
rain
trickled
down
her
neck
she
drew
herself
up
and
went
off
to
the
exterior
boulevard
wrapped
in
thought
and
not
daring
to
enter
ah
well
coupeau
would
have
welcomed
her
in
a
pleasant
way
he
who
objected
to
be
spied
upon
besides
it
really
scarcely
seemed
to
her
the
proper
place
for
a
respectable
woman
twice
she
went
back
and
stood
before
the
shop
window
her
eyes
again
riveted
to
the
glass
annoyed
at
still
beholding
those
confounded
drunkards
out
of
the
rain
and
yelling
and
drinking
the
light
of
was
reflected
in
the
puddles
on
the
pavement
which
simmered
with
little
bubbles
caused
by
the
downpour
at
length
she
thought
she
was
too
foolish
and
pushing
open
the
door
she
walked
straight
up
to
the
table
where
coupeau
was
sitting
after
all
it
was
her
husband
she
came
for
was
it
not
and
she
was
authorized
in
doing
so
because
he
had
promised
to
take
her
to
the
circus
that
evening
so
much
the
worse
she
had
no
desire
to
melt
like
a
cake
of
soap
out
on
the
pavement
hullo
it
you
old
woman
exclaimed
the
half
choking
with
a
chuckle
ah
that
a
good
joke
is
it
a
good
joke
now
all
the
company
laughed
gervaise
remained
standing
feeling
rather
bewildered
coupeau
appeared
to
her
to
be
in
a
pleasant
humor
so
she
ventured
to
say
you
remember
we
somewhere
to
go
we
must
hurry
we
shall
still
be
in
time
to
see
something
i
ca
get
up
i
glued
oh
without
joking
resumed
coupeau
who
continued
laughing
try
just
to
satisfy
yourself
pull
my
arm
with
all
your
strength
try
it
harder
than
that
tug
away
up
with
it
you
see
it
that
louse
pere
colombe
who
screwed
me
to
his
seat
gervaise
had
humored
him
at
this
game
and
when
she
let
go
of
his
arm
the
comrades
thought
the
joke
so
good
that
they
tumbled
up
against
one
another
braying
and
rubbing
their
shoulders
like
donkeys
being
groomed
the
mouth
was
so
wide
with
laughter
that
you
could
see
right
down
his
throat
you
great
noodle
said
he
at
length
you
can
surely
sit
down
a
minute
you
better
here
than
splashing
about
outside
well
yes
i
did
come
home
as
i
promised
i
had
business
to
attend
to
though
you
may
pull
a
long
face
it
wo
alter
matters
make
room
you
others
if
madame
would
accept
my
knees
she
would
find
them
softer
than
the
seat
gallantly
said
gervaise
not
wishing
to
attract
attention
took
a
chair
and
sat
down
at
a
short
distance
from
the
table
she
looked
at
what
the
men
were
drinking
some
rotgut
brandy
which
shone
like
gold
in
the
glasses
a
little
of
it
had
dropped
upon
the
table
and
otherwise
dipped
his
finger
in
it
whilst
conversing
and
wrote
a
woman
name
eulalie
in
big
letters
she
noticed
that
looked
shockingly
jaded
and
thinner
than
a
of
nails
nose
was
in
full
bloom
a
regular
purple
burgundy
dahlia
they
were
all
quite
dirty
their
beards
stiff
their
smocks
ragged
and
stained
their
hands
grimy
with
dirt
yet
they
were
still
quite
polite
gervaise
noticed
a
couple
of
men
at
the
bar
they
were
so
drunk
that
they
were
spilling
the
drink
down
their
chins
when
they
thought
they
were
wetting
their
whistles
fat
pere
colombe
was
calmly
serving
round
after
round
the
atmosphere
was
very
warm
the
smoke
from
the
pipes
ascended
in
the
blinding
glare
of
the
gas
amidst
which
it
rolled
about
like
dust
drowning
the
customers
in
a
gradually
thickening
mist
and
from
this
cloud
there
issued
a
deafening
and
confused
uproar
cracked
voices
clinking
of
glasses
oaths
and
blows
sounding
like
detonations
so
gervaise
pulled
a
very
wry
face
for
such
a
sight
is
not
funny
for
a
woman
especially
when
she
is
not
used
to
it
she
was
stifling
with
a
smarting
sensation
in
her
eyes
and
her
head
already
feeling
heavy
from
the
alcoholic
fumes
exhaled
by
the
whole
place
then
she
suddenly
experienced
the
sensation
of
something
more
unpleasant
still
behind
her
back
she
turned
round
and
beheld
the
still
the
machine
which
manufactured
drunkards
working
away
beneath
the
glass
roof
of
the
narrow
courtyard
with
the
profound
trepidation
of
its
hellish
cookery
of
an
evening
the
copper
parts
looked
more
mournful
than
ever
lit
up
only
on
their
rounded
surface
with
one
big
red
glint
and
the
shadow
of
the
apparatus
on
the
wall
at
the
back
formed
most
abominable
figures
bodies
with
tails
monsters
opening
their
jaws
as
though
to
swallow
everyone
up
listen
mother
do
make
any
of
your
grimaces
cried
coupeau
to
blazes
you
know
with
all
wet
blankets
what
you
drink
nothing
of
course
replied
the
laundress
i
have
dined
yet
well
that
all
the
more
reason
for
having
a
glass
a
drop
of
something
sustains
one
but
as
she
still
retained
her
glum
expression
again
did
the
gallant
madame
probably
likes
sweet
things
murmured
he
i
like
men
who
do
get
drunk
retorted
she
getting
angry
yes
i
like
a
fellow
who
brings
home
his
earnings
and
who
keeps
his
word
when
he
makes
a
promise
ah
so
that
what
upsets
you
said
the
without
ceasing
to
chuckle
yes
you
want
your
share
then
big
goose
why
do
you
refuse
a
drink
take
it
it
so
much
to
the
good
she
looked
at
him
fixedly
in
a
grave
manner
a
wrinkle
marking
her
forehead
with
a
black
line
and
she
slowly
replied
why
you
right
it
a
good
idea
that
way
we
can
drink
up
the
coin
together
rose
from
his
seat
to
fetch
her
a
glass
of
anisette
she
drew
her
chair
up
to
the
table
whilst
she
was
sipping
her
anisette
a
recollection
suddenly
flashed
across
her
mind
she
remembered
the
plum
she
had
taken
with
coupeau
near
the
door
in
the
old
days
when
he
was
courting
her
at
that
time
she
used
to
leave
the
juice
of
fruits
preserved
in
brandy
and
now
here
was
she
going
back
to
liqueurs
oh
she
knew
herself
well
she
had
not
two
thimblefuls
of
will
one
would
only
have
had
to
have
given
her
a
walloping
across
the
back
to
have
made
her
regularly
wallow
in
drink
the
anisette
even
seemed
to
be
very
good
perhaps
rather
too
sweet
and
slightly
sickening
she
went
on
sipping
as
she
listened
to
otherwise
tell
of
his
affair
with
fat
eulalie
a
fish
peddler
and
very
shrewd
at
locating
him
even
if
his
comrades
tried
to
hide
him
she
could
usually
sniff
him
out
when
he
was
late
just
the
night
before
she
had
slapped
his
face
with
a
flounder
to
teach
him
not
to
neglect
going
to
work
and
nearly
split
their
sides
laughing
they
slapped
gervaise
on
the
shoulder
and
she
began
to
laugh
also
finding
it
amusing
in
spite
of
herself
they
then
advised
her
to
follow
example
and
bring
an
iron
with
her
so
as
to
press
coupeau
ears
on
the
counters
of
the
wineshops
ah
well
no
thanks
cried
coupeau
as
he
turned
upside
down
the
glass
his
wife
had
emptied
you
pump
it
out
pretty
well
just
look
you
fellows
she
does
take
long
over
it
will
madame
take
another
asked
otherwise
no
she
had
had
enough
yet
she
hesitated
the
anisette
had
slightly
bothered
her
stomach
she
should
have
taken
straight
brandy
to
settle
her
digestion
she
cast
side
glances
at
the
drunkard
manufacturing
machine
behind
her
that
confounded
pot
as
round
as
the
stomach
of
a
tinker
fat
wife
with
its
nose
that
was
so
long
and
twisted
sent
a
shiver
down
her
back
a
fear
mingled
with
a
desire
yes
one
might
have
thought
it
the
metal
pluck
of
some
big
wicked
woman
of
some
witch
who
was
discharging
drop
by
drop
the
fire
of
her
entrails
a
fine
source
of
poison
an
operation
which
should
have
been
hidden
away
in
a
cellar
it
was
so
brazen
and
abominable
but
all
the
same
she
would
have
liked
to
have
poked
her
nose
inside
it
to
have
sniffed
the
odor
have
tasted
the
filth
though
the
skin
might
have
peeled
off
her
burnt
tongue
like
the
rind
off
an
orange
what
that
you
drinking
asked
she
slyly
of
the
men
her
eyes
lighted
up
by
the
beautiful
golden
color
of
their
glasses
that
old
woman
answered
coupeau
is
pere
colombe
camphor
be
silly
now
and
we
give
you
a
taste
and
when
they
had
brought
her
a
glass
of
the
vitriol
the
rotgut
and
her
jaws
had
contracted
at
the
first
mouthful
the
resumed
slapping
his
thighs
ha
it
tickles
your
gullet
drink
it
off
at
one
go
each
glassful
cheats
the
doctor
of
six
francs
at
the
second
glass
gervaise
no
longer
felt
the
hunger
which
had
been
tormenting
her
now
she
had
made
it
up
with
coupeau
she
no
longer
felt
angry
with
him
for
not
having
kept
his
word
they
would
go
to
the
circus
some
other
day
it
was
not
so
funny
to
see
jugglers
galloping
about
on
houses
there
was
no
rain
inside
pere
colombe
and
if
the
money
went
in
brandy
one
at
least
had
it
in
one
body
one
drank
it
bright
and
shining
like
beautiful
liquid
gold
ah
she
was
ready
to
send
the
whole
world
to
blazes
life
was
not
so
pleasant
after
all
besides
it
seemed
some
consolation
to
her
to
have
her
share
in
squandering
the
cash
as
she
was
comfortable
why
should
she
not
remain
one
might
have
a
discharge
of
artillery
she
did
not
care
to
budge
once
she
had
settled
in
a
heap
she
nursed
herself
in
a
pleasant
warmth
her
bodice
sticking
to
her
back
overcome
by
a
feeling
of
comfort
which
benumbed
her
limbs
she
laughed
all
to
herself
her
elbows
on
the
table
a
vacant
look
in
her
eyes
highly
amused
by
two
customers
a
fat
heavy
fellow
and
a
tiny
shrimp
seated
at
a
neighboring
table
and
kissing
each
other
lovingly
yes
she
laughed
at
the
things
to
see
in
at
pere
full
moon
face
a
regular
bladder
of
lard
at
the
customers
smoking
their
short
clay
pipes
yelling
and
spitting
and
at
the
big
flames
of
gas
which
lighted
up
the
and
the
bottles
of
liqueurs
the
smell
no
longer
bothered
her
on
the
contrary
it
tickled
her
nose
and
she
thought
it
very
pleasant
her
eyes
slightly
closed
whilst
she
breathed
very
slowly
without
the
least
feeling
of
suffocation
tasting
the
enjoyment
of
the
gentle
slumber
which
was
overcoming
her
then
after
her
third
glass
she
let
her
chin
fall
on
her
hands
she
now
only
saw
coupeau
and
his
comrades
and
she
remained
nose
to
nose
with
them
quite
close
her
cheeks
warmed
by
their
breath
looking
at
their
dirty
beards
as
though
she
had
been
counting
the
hairs
drooled
his
pipe
between
his
teeth
with
the
dumb
and
grave
air
of
a
dozing
ox
was
telling
a
story
the
manner
in
which
he
emptied
a
bottle
at
a
draught
giving
it
such
a
kiss
that
one
instantly
saw
its
bottom
meanwhile
otherwise
had
gone
and
fetched
the
wheel
of
fortune
from
the
counter
and
was
playing
with
coupeau
for
drinks
two
hundred
you
lucky
you
get
high
numbers
every
time
the
needle
of
the
wheel
grated
and
the
figure
of
fortune
a
big
red
woman
placed
under
glass
turned
round
and
round
until
it
looked
like
a
mere
spot
in
the
centre
similar
to
a
wine
stain
three
hundred
and
fifty
you
must
have
been
inside
it
you
confounded
lascar
ah
i
sha
play
any
more
gervaise
amused
herself
with
the
wheel
of
fortune
she
was
feeling
awfully
thirsty
and
calling
my
child
behind
her
the
machine
for
manufacturing
drunkards
continued
working
with
its
murmur
of
an
underground
stream
and
she
despaired
of
ever
stopping
it
of
exhausting
it
filled
with
a
sullen
anger
against
it
feeling
a
longing
to
spring
upon
the
big
still
as
upon
some
animal
to
kick
it
with
her
heels
and
stave
in
its
belly
then
everything
began
to
seem
all
mixed
up
the
machine
seemed
to
be
moving
itself
and
she
thought
she
was
being
grabbed
by
its
copper
claws
and
that
the
underground
stream
was
now
flowing
over
her
body
then
the
room
danced
round
the
seemed
to
shoot
like
stars
gervaise
was
drunk
she
heard
a
furious
wrangle
between
otherwise
and
that
rascal
pere
colombe
there
was
a
thief
of
a
landlord
who
wanted
one
to
pay
for
what
one
had
not
had
yet
one
was
not
at
a
gangster
suddenly
there
was
a
scuffling
yells
were
heard
and
tables
were
upset
it
was
pere
colombe
who
was
turning
the
party
out
without
the
least
hesitation
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
they
blackguarded
him
and
called
him
a
scoundrel
it
still
rained
and
blew
icy
cold
gervaise
lost
coupeau
found
him
and
then
lost
him
again
she
wished
to
go
home
she
felt
the
shops
to
find
her
way
this
sudden
darkness
surprised
her
immensely
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
poissonniers
she
sat
down
in
the
gutter
thinking
she
was
at
the
the
water
which
flowed
along
caused
her
head
to
swim
and
made
her
very
at
length
she
arrived
she
passed
stiffly
before
the
concierge
room
where
she
perfectly
recognized
the
lorilleuxs
and
the
poissons
seated
at
the
table
having
dinner
and
who
made
grimaces
of
disgust
on
beholding
her
in
that
sorry
state
she
never
remembered
how
she
had
got
up
all
those
flights
of
stairs
just
as
she
was
turning
into
the
passage
at
the
top
little
lalie
who
heard
her
footsteps
hastened
to
meet
her
opening
her
arms
caressingly
and
saying
with
a
smile
madame
gervaise
papa
has
not
returned
just
come
and
see
my
little
children
sleeping
oh
they
look
so
pretty
but
on
beholding
the
laundress
besotted
face
she
tremblingly
drew
back
she
was
acquainted
with
that
breath
those
pale
eyes
that
convulsed
mouth
then
gervaise
stumbled
past
without
uttering
a
word
whilst
the
child
standing
on
the
threshold
of
her
room
followed
her
with
her
dark
eyes
grave
and
speechless
chapter
xi
nana
was
growing
up
and
becoming
wayward
at
fifteen
years
old
she
had
expanded
like
a
calf
and
very
fat
so
plump
indeed
you
might
have
called
her
a
pincushion
yes
such
she
was
fifteen
years
old
full
of
figure
and
no
stays
a
saucy
magpie
face
dipped
in
milk
a
skin
as
soft
as
a
peach
skin
a
funny
nose
pink
lips
and
eyes
sparkling
like
tapers
which
men
would
have
liked
to
light
their
pipes
at
her
pile
of
fair
hair
the
color
of
fresh
oats
seemed
to
have
scattered
gold
dust
over
her
temples
as
it
were
giving
her
brow
a
sunny
crown
ah
a
pretty
doll
as
the
lorilleuxs
say
a
dirty
nose
that
needed
wiping
with
fat
shoulders
which
were
as
fully
rounded
and
as
powerful
as
those
of
a
woman
nana
no
longer
needed
to
stuff
wads
of
paper
into
her
bodice
her
breasts
were
grown
she
wished
they
were
larger
though
and
dreamed
of
having
breasts
like
a
what
made
her
particularly
tempting
was
a
nasty
habit
she
had
of
protruding
the
tip
of
her
tongue
between
her
white
teeth
no
doubt
on
seeing
herself
in
the
she
had
thought
she
was
pretty
like
this
and
so
all
day
long
she
poked
her
tongue
out
of
her
mouth
in
view
of
improving
her
appearance
hide
your
lying
tongue
cried
her
mother
coupeau
would
often
get
involved
pounding
his
fist
swearing
and
shouting
make
haste
and
draw
that
red
rag
inside
again
nana
showed
herself
very
coquettish
she
did
not
always
wash
her
feet
but
she
bought
such
tight
boots
that
she
suffered
martyrdom
in
crispin
prison
and
if
folks
questioned
her
when
she
turned
purple
with
pain
she
answered
that
she
had
the
stomach
ache
so
as
to
avoid
confessing
her
coquetry
when
bread
was
lacking
at
home
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
trick
herself
out
but
she
accomplished
miracles
brought
ribbons
back
from
the
workshop
and
concocted
toilettes
dirty
dresses
set
off
with
bows
and
puffs
the
summer
was
the
season
of
her
greatest
triumphs
with
a
cambric
dress
which
had
cost
her
six
francs
she
filled
the
whole
neighborhood
of
the
with
her
fair
beauty
yes
she
was
known
from
the
outer
boulevards
to
the
fortifications
and
from
the
chaussee
de
clignancourt
to
the
grand
rue
of
la
chapelle
folks
called
her
chickie
for
she
was
really
as
tender
and
as
as
a
chicken
there
was
one
dress
which
suited
her
perfectly
a
white
one
with
pink
dots
it
was
very
simple
and
without
a
frill
the
skirt
was
rather
short
and
revealed
her
ankles
the
sleeves
were
deeply
slashed
and
loose
showing
her
arms
to
the
elbow
she
pinned
the
neck
back
into
a
wide
v
as
soon
as
she
reached
a
dark
corner
of
the
staircase
to
avoid
getting
her
ears
boxed
by
her
father
for
exposing
the
snowy
whiteness
of
her
throat
and
the
golden
shadow
between
her
breasts
she
also
tied
a
pink
ribbon
round
her
blond
hair
sundays
she
spent
the
entire
day
out
with
the
crowds
and
loved
it
when
the
men
eyed
her
hungrily
as
they
passed
she
waited
all
week
long
for
these
glances
she
would
get
up
early
to
dress
herself
and
spend
hours
before
the
fragment
of
mirror
that
was
hung
over
the
bureau
her
mother
would
scold
her
because
the
entire
building
could
see
her
through
the
window
in
her
chemise
as
she
mended
her
dress
ah
she
looked
cute
like
that
said
father
coupeau
sneering
and
jeering
at
her
a
real
magdalene
in
despair
she
might
have
turned
savage
woman
at
a
fair
and
have
shown
herself
for
a
penny
hide
your
meat
he
used
to
say
and
let
me
eat
my
bread
in
fact
she
was
adorable
white
and
dainty
under
her
overhanging
golden
fleece
losing
temper
to
the
point
that
her
skin
turned
pink
not
daring
to
answer
her
father
but
cutting
her
thread
with
her
teeth
with
a
hasty
furious
jerk
which
shook
her
plump
but
youthful
form
then
immediately
after
breakfast
she
tripped
down
the
stairs
into
the
courtyard
the
entire
tenement
seemed
to
be
resting
sleepily
in
the
peacefulness
of
a
sunday
afternoon
the
workshops
on
the
ground
floor
were
closed
gaping
windows
revealed
tables
in
some
apartments
that
were
already
set
for
dinner
awaiting
families
out
working
up
an
appetite
by
strolling
along
the
fortifications
then
in
the
midst
of
the
empty
echoing
courtyard
nana
pauline
and
other
big
girls
engaged
in
games
of
battledore
and
shuttlecock
they
had
grown
up
together
and
were
now
becoming
queens
of
their
building
whenever
a
man
crossed
the
court
flutelike
laugher
would
arise
and
then
starched
skirts
would
rustle
like
the
passing
of
a
gust
of
wind
the
games
were
only
an
excuse
for
them
to
make
their
escape
suddenly
stillness
fell
upon
the
tenement
the
girls
had
glided
out
into
the
street
and
made
for
the
outer
boulevards
then
linked
across
the
full
breadth
of
the
pavement
they
went
off
the
whole
six
of
them
clad
in
light
colors
with
ribbons
tied
around
their
bare
heads
with
bright
eyes
darting
stealthy
glances
through
their
partially
closed
eyelids
they
took
note
of
everything
and
constantly
threw
back
their
necks
to
laugh
displaying
the
fleshy
part
of
their
chins
they
would
swing
their
hips
or
group
together
tightly
or
flaunt
along
with
awkward
grace
all
for
the
purpose
of
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
their
forms
were
filling
out
nana
was
in
the
centre
with
her
pink
dress
all
aglow
in
the
sunlight
she
gave
her
arm
to
pauline
whose
costume
yellow
flowers
on
a
white
ground
glared
in
similar
fashion
dotted
as
it
were
with
little
flames
as
they
were
the
tallest
of
the
band
the
most
and
most
unblushing
they
led
the
troop
and
drew
themselves
up
with
breasts
well
forward
whenever
they
detected
glances
or
heard
complimentary
remarks
the
others
extended
right
and
left
puffing
themselves
out
in
order
to
attract
attention
nana
and
pauline
resorted
to
the
complicated
devices
of
experienced
coquettes
if
they
ran
till
they
were
out
of
breath
it
was
in
view
of
showing
their
white
stockings
and
making
the
ribbons
of
their
chignons
wave
in
the
breeze
when
they
stopped
pretending
complete
breathlessness
you
would
certainly
spot
someone
they
knew
quite
near
one
of
the
young
fellows
of
the
neighborhood
this
would
make
them
dawdle
along
languidly
whispering
and
laughing
among
themselves
but
keeping
a
sharp
watch
through
their
downcast
eyelids
they
went
on
these
strolls
of
a
sunday
mainly
for
the
sake
of
these
chance
meetings
tall
lads
wearing
their
sunday
best
would
stop
them
joking
and
trying
to
catch
them
round
their
waists
pauline
was
forever
running
into
one
of
madame
gaudron
sons
a
carpenter
who
would
treat
her
to
fried
potatoes
nana
could
spot
victor
fauconnier
the
laundress
son
and
they
would
exchange
kisses
in
dark
corners
it
never
went
farther
than
that
but
they
told
each
other
some
tall
tales
then
when
the
sun
set
the
great
delight
of
these
young
hussies
was
to
stop
and
look
at
the
mountebanks
conjurors
and
strong
men
turned
up
and
spread
threadbare
carpets
on
the
soil
of
the
avenue
loungers
collected
and
a
circle
formed
whilst
the
mountebank
in
the
centre
tried
his
muscles
under
his
faded
tights
nana
and
pauline
would
stand
for
hours
in
the
thickest
part
of
the
crowd
their
pretty
fresh
frocks
would
get
crushed
between
and
dirty
work
smocks
in
this
atmosphere
of
wine
and
sweat
they
would
laugh
gaily
finding
amusement
in
everything
blooming
naturally
like
roses
growing
out
of
a
dunghill
the
only
thing
that
vexed
them
was
to
meet
their
fathers
especially
when
the
hatter
had
been
drinking
so
they
watched
and
warned
one
another
look
nana
pauline
would
suddenly
cry
out
here
comes
father
coupeau
well
he
drunk
too
oh
dear
said
nana
greatly
bothered
going
to
beat
it
you
know
i
do
want
him
to
give
me
a
wallop
hullo
how
he
stumbles
good
lord
if
he
could
only
break
his
neck
at
other
times
when
coupeau
came
straight
up
to
her
without
giving
her
time
to
run
off
she
crouched
down
made
herself
small
and
muttered
just
you
hide
me
you
others
he
looking
for
me
and
he
promised
knock
my
head
off
if
he
caught
me
hanging
about
then
when
the
drunkard
had
passed
them
she
drew
herself
up
again
and
all
the
others
followed
her
with
bursts
of
laughter
he
find
her
he
will
he
wo
it
was
a
true
game
of
hide
and
seek
one
day
however
boche
had
come
after
pauline
and
caught
her
by
both
ears
and
coupeau
had
driven
nana
home
with
kicks
nana
was
now
a
and
earned
forty
sous
a
day
at
place
in
the
rue
du
caire
where
she
had
served
as
apprentice
the
coupeaus
had
kept
her
there
so
that
she
might
remain
under
the
eye
of
madame
lerat
who
had
been
forewoman
in
the
workroom
for
ten
years
of
a
morning
when
her
mother
looked
at
the
cuckoo
clock
off
she
went
by
herself
looking
very
pretty
with
her
shoulders
tightly
confined
in
her
old
black
dress
which
was
both
too
narrow
and
too
short
and
madame
lerat
had
to
note
the
hour
of
her
arrival
and
tell
it
to
gervaise
she
was
allowed
twenty
minutes
to
go
from
the
rue
de
la
to
the
rue
du
caire
and
it
was
enough
for
these
young
hussies
have
the
legs
of
racehorses
sometimes
she
arrived
exactly
on
time
but
so
breathless
and
flushed
that
she
must
have
covered
most
of
the
distance
at
a
run
after
dawdling
along
the
way
more
often
she
was
a
few
minutes
late
then
she
would
fawn
on
her
aunt
all
day
hoping
to
soften
her
and
keep
her
from
telling
madame
lerat
understood
what
it
was
to
be
young
and
would
lie
to
the
coupeaus
but
she
also
lectured
nana
stressing
the
dangers
a
young
girl
runs
on
the
streets
of
paris
dieu
she
herself
was
followed
often
enough
oh
i
watch
you
need
fear
said
the
widow
to
the
coupeaus
i
will
answer
to
you
for
her
as
i
would
for
myself
and
rather
than
let
a
blackguard
squeeze
her
why
i
step
between
them
the
workroom
at
titreville
was
a
large
apartment
on
the
first
floor
with
a
broad
standing
on
trestles
in
the
centre
round
the
four
walls
the
plaster
of
which
was
visible
in
parts
where
the
dirty
paper
was
torn
away
there
were
several
stands
covered
with
old
cardboard
boxes
parcels
and
discarded
patterns
under
a
thick
coating
of
dust
the
gas
had
left
what
appeared
to
be
like
a
daub
of
soot
on
the
ceiling
the
two
windows
opened
so
wide
that
without
leaving
the
the
girls
could
see
the
people
walking
past
on
the
pavement
over
the
way
madame
lerat
arrived
the
first
in
view
of
setting
an
example
then
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
door
swayed
to
and
fro
and
all
the
workgirls
scrambled
in
perspiring
with
tumbled
hair
one
july
morning
nana
arrived
the
last
as
very
often
happened
ah
me
she
said
it
be
a
pity
when
i
have
a
carriage
of
my
own
and
without
even
taking
off
her
hat
one
which
she
was
weary
of
patching
up
she
approached
the
window
and
leant
out
looking
to
the
right
and
the
left
to
see
what
was
going
on
in
the
street
what
are
you
looking
at
asked
madame
lerat
suspiciously
did
your
father
come
with
you
no
you
may
be
sure
of
that
answered
nana
coolly
i
looking
at
nothing
i
seeing
how
hot
it
is
it
enough
to
make
anyone
having
to
run
like
that
it
was
a
stifling
hot
morning
the
workgirls
had
drawn
down
the
venetian
blinds
between
which
they
could
spy
out
into
the
street
and
they
had
at
last
begun
working
on
either
side
of
the
table
at
the
upper
end
of
which
sat
madame
lerat
they
were
eight
in
number
each
with
her
pot
of
glue
pincers
tools
and
curling
stand
in
front
of
her
on
the
lay
a
mass
of
wire
reels
cotton
wool
green
and
brown
paper
leaves
and
petals
cut
out
of
silk
satin
or
velvet
in
the
centre
in
the
neck
of
a
large
decanter
one
had
thrust
a
little
penny
nosegay
which
had
been
fading
on
her
breast
since
the
day
before
oh
i
have
some
news
said
a
pretty
brunette
named
leonie
as
she
leaned
over
her
cushion
to
crimp
some
rose
petals
poor
caroline
is
very
unhappy
about
that
fellow
who
used
to
wait
for
her
every
evening
ah
said
nana
who
was
cutting
thin
strips
of
green
paper
a
man
who
cheats
on
her
every
day
madame
lerat
had
to
display
severity
over
the
muffled
laughter
then
leonie
whispered
suddenly
quiet
the
boss
it
was
indeed
madame
titreville
who
entered
the
tall
thin
woman
usually
stayed
down
in
the
shop
the
girls
were
quite
in
awe
of
her
because
she
never
joked
with
them
all
the
heads
were
now
bent
over
the
work
in
diligent
silence
madame
titreville
slowly
circled
the
she
told
one
girl
her
work
was
sloppy
and
made
her
do
the
flower
over
then
she
stalked
out
as
stiffly
as
she
had
come
in
the
complaining
and
low
laughter
began
again
really
young
ladies
said
madame
lerat
trying
to
look
more
severe
than
ever
you
will
force
me
to
take
measures
the
workgirls
paid
no
attention
to
her
they
were
not
afraid
of
her
she
was
too
because
she
enjoyed
being
surrounded
by
these
young
girls
whose
zest
for
life
sparkled
in
their
eyes
she
enjoyed
taking
them
aside
to
hear
their
confidences
about
their
lovers
she
even
told
their
fortunes
with
cards
whenever
a
corner
of
the
was
free
she
was
only
offended
by
coarse
expressions
as
long
as
you
avoided
those
you
could
say
what
you
pleased
to
tell
the
truth
nana
perfected
her
education
in
nice
style
in
the
workroom
no
doubt
she
was
already
inclined
to
go
wrong
but
this
was
the
finishing
stroke
associating
with
a
lot
of
girls
who
were
already
worn
out
with
misery
and
vice
they
all
hobnobbed
and
rotted
together
just
the
story
of
the
baskets
of
apples
when
there
are
rotten
ones
among
them
they
maintained
a
certain
propriety
in
public
but
the
smut
flowed
freely
when
they
got
to
whispering
together
in
a
corner
for
inexperienced
girls
like
nana
there
was
an
undesirable
atmosphere
around
the
workshop
an
air
of
cheap
dance
halls
and
unorthodox
evenings
brought
in
by
some
of
the
girls
the
laziness
of
mornings
after
a
gay
night
the
shadows
under
the
eyes
the
lounging
the
hoarse
voices
all
spread
an
odor
of
dark
perversion
over
the
which
contrasted
sharply
with
the
brilliant
fragility
of
the
artificial
flowers
nana
eagerly
drank
it
all
in
and
was
dizzy
with
joy
when
she
found
herself
beside
a
girl
who
had
been
around
she
always
wanted
to
sit
next
to
big
lisa
who
was
said
to
be
pregnant
and
she
kept
glancing
curiously
at
her
neighbor
as
though
expecting
her
to
swell
up
suddenly
it
hot
enough
to
make
one
stifle
nana
said
approaching
a
window
as
if
to
draw
the
blind
farther
down
but
she
leant
forward
and
again
looked
out
both
to
the
right
and
left
at
the
same
moment
leonie
who
was
watching
a
man
stationed
at
the
foot
of
the
pavement
over
the
way
exclaimed
what
that
old
fellow
about
he
been
spying
here
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
some
tom
cat
said
madame
lerat
nana
just
come
and
sit
down
i
told
you
not
to
stand
at
the
window
nana
took
up
the
stems
of
some
violets
she
was
rolling
and
the
whole
workroom
turned
its
attention
to
the
man
in
question
he
was
a
individual
wearing
a
frock
coat
and
he
looked
about
fifty
years
old
he
had
a
pale
face
very
serous
and
dignified
in
expression
framed
round
with
a
well
trimmed
grey
beard
he
remained
for
an
hour
in
front
of
a
herbalist
shop
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
venetian
blinds
of
the
workroom
the
indulged
in
little
bursts
of
laughter
which
died
away
amid
the
noise
of
the
street
and
while
leaning
forward
to
all
appearance
busy
with
their
work
they
glanced
askance
so
as
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
gentleman
ah
remarked
leonie
he
wears
glasses
he
a
swell
he
waiting
for
augustine
no
doubt
but
augustine
a
tall
ugly
girl
sourly
answered
that
she
did
not
like
old
men
whereupon
madame
lerat
jerking
her
head
answered
with
a
smile
full
of
underhand
meaning
that
is
a
great
mistake
on
your
part
my
dear
the
old
ones
are
more
affectionate
at
this
moment
leonie
neighbor
a
plump
little
body
whispered
something
in
her
ear
and
leonie
suddenly
threw
herself
back
on
her
chair
seized
with
a
fit
of
noisy
laughter
wriggling
looking
at
the
gentleman
and
then
laughing
all
the
louder
that
it
oh
that
it
she
stammered
how
dirty
that
sophie
is
what
did
she
say
what
did
she
say
asked
the
whole
workroom
aglow
with
curiosity
leonie
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
without
answering
when
she
became
somewhat
calmer
she
began
curling
her
flowers
again
and
declared
it
ca
be
repeated
the
others
insisted
but
she
shook
her
head
seized
again
with
a
gust
of
gaiety
thereupon
augustine
her
neighbor
besought
her
to
whisper
it
to
her
and
finally
leonie
consented
to
do
so
with
her
lips
close
to
augustine
ear
augustine
threw
herself
back
and
wriggled
with
convulsive
laughter
in
her
turn
then
she
repeated
the
phrase
to
a
girl
next
to
her
and
from
ear
to
ear
it
traveled
round
the
room
amid
exclamations
and
stifled
laughter
when
they
were
all
of
them
acquainted
with
sophie
disgusting
remark
they
looked
at
one
another
and
burst
out
laughing
together
although
a
little
flushed
and
confused
madame
lerat
alone
was
not
in
the
secret
and
she
felt
extremely
vexed
that
very
impolite
behavior
on
your
part
young
ladies
said
she
it
is
not
right
to
whisper
when
other
people
are
present
something
indecent
no
doubt
ah
that
becoming
she
did
not
dare
go
so
far
as
to
ask
them
to
pass
sophie
remark
on
to
her
although
she
burned
to
hear
it
so
she
kept
her
eyes
on
her
work
amusing
herself
by
listening
to
the
conversation
now
no
one
could
make
even
an
innocent
remark
without
the
others
twisting
it
around
and
connecting
it
with
the
gentleman
on
the
sidewalk
madame
lerat
herself
once
sent
them
into
convulsions
of
laughter
when
she
said
mademoiselle
lisa
my
fire
gone
out
pass
me
yours
oh
madame
lerat
fire
out
laughed
the
whole
shop
they
refused
to
listen
to
any
explanation
but
maintained
they
were
going
to
call
in
the
gentleman
outside
to
rekindle
madame
lerat
fire
however
the
gentleman
over
the
way
had
gone
off
the
room
grew
calmer
and
the
work
was
carried
on
in
the
sultry
heat
when
twelve
struck
they
all
shook
themselves
nana
who
had
hastened
to
the
window
again
volunteered
to
do
the
errands
if
they
liked
and
leonie
ordered
two
sous
worth
of
shrimps
augustine
a
screw
of
fried
potatoes
lisa
a
bunch
of
radishes
sophie
a
sausage
then
as
nana
was
doing
down
the
stairs
madame
lerat
who
found
her
partiality
for
the
window
that
morning
rather
curious
overtook
her
with
her
long
legs
wait
a
bit
said
she
i
go
with
you
i
want
to
buy
something
too
but
in
the
passage
below
she
perceived
the
gentleman
stuck
there
like
a
candle
and
exchanging
glances
with
nana
the
girl
flushed
very
red
whereupon
her
aunt
at
once
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
made
her
trot
over
the
pavement
whilst
the
individual
followed
behind
ah
so
the
tom
cat
had
come
for
nana
well
that
nice
at
fifteen
years
and
a
half
to
have
men
trailing
after
her
then
madame
lerat
hastily
began
to
question
her
dieu
nana
did
know
he
had
only
been
following
her
for
five
days
but
she
could
not
poke
her
nose
out
of
doors
without
stumbling
on
men
she
believed
he
was
in
business
yes
a
manufacturer
of
bone
buttons
madame
lerat
was
greatly
impressed
she
turned
round
and
glanced
at
the
gentleman
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
one
can
see
he
got
a
deep
purse
she
muttered
listen
to
me
kitten
you
must
tell
me
everything
you
have
nothing
more
to
fear
now
whilst
speaking
they
hastened
from
shop
to
shop
to
the
pork
butcher
the
fruiterer
the
and
the
errands
in
greasy
paper
were
piled
up
in
their
hands
still
they
remained
amiable
flouncing
along
and
casting
bright
glances
behind
them
with
gusts
of
gay
laughter
madame
lerat
herself
was
acting
the
young
girl
on
account
of
the
button
manufacturer
who
was
still
following
them
he
is
very
distinguished
looking
she
declared
as
they
returned
into
the
passage
if
he
only
has
honorable
views
then
as
they
were
going
up
the
stairs
she
suddenly
seemed
to
remember
something
by
the
way
tell
me
what
the
girls
were
whispering
to
each
other
you
know
what
sophie
said
nana
did
not
make
any
ceremony
only
she
caught
madame
lerat
by
the
hand
and
caused
her
to
descend
a
couple
of
steps
for
really
it
would
do
to
say
it
aloud
not
even
on
the
stairs
when
she
whispered
it
to
her
it
was
so
obscene
that
madame
lerat
could
only
shake
her
head
opening
her
eyes
wide
and
pursing
her
lips
well
at
least
her
curiosity
was
troubling
her
any
longer
from
that
day
forth
madame
lerat
regaled
herself
with
her
niece
first
love
adventure
she
no
longer
left
her
but
accompanied
her
morning
and
evening
bringing
her
responsibility
well
to
the
fore
this
somewhat
annoyed
nana
but
all
the
same
she
expanded
with
pride
at
seeing
herself
guarded
like
a
treasure
and
the
talk
she
and
her
aunt
indulged
in
in
the
street
with
the
button
manufacturer
behind
them
flattered
her
and
rather
quickened
her
desire
for
new
flirtations
oh
her
aunt
understood
the
feelings
of
the
heart
she
even
compassionated
the
button
manufacturer
this
elderly
gentleman
who
looked
so
respectable
for
after
all
sentimental
feelings
are
more
deeply
rooted
among
people
of
a
certain
age
still
she
watched
and
yes
he
would
have
to
pass
over
her
body
before
stealing
her
niece
one
evening
she
approached
the
gentleman
and
told
him
as
straight
as
a
bullet
that
his
conduct
was
most
improper
he
bowed
to
her
politely
without
answering
like
an
old
satyr
who
was
accustomed
to
hear
parents
tell
him
to
go
about
his
business
she
really
could
not
be
cross
with
him
he
was
too
well
mannered
then
came
lectures
on
love
allusions
to
dirty
blackguards
of
men
and
all
sorts
of
stories
about
hussies
who
had
repented
of
flirtations
which
left
nana
in
a
state
of
pouting
with
eyes
gleaming
brightly
in
her
pale
face
one
day
however
in
the
rue
du
the
button
manufacturer
ventured
to
poke
his
nose
between
the
aunt
and
the
niece
to
whisper
some
things
which
ought
not
to
have
been
said
thereupon
madame
lerat
was
so
frightened
that
she
declared
she
no
longer
felt
able
to
handle
the
matter
and
she
told
the
whole
business
to
her
brother
then
came
another
row
there
were
some
pretty
rumpuses
in
the
coupeaus
room
to
begin
with
the
gave
nana
a
hiding
what
was
that
he
learnt
the
hussy
was
flirting
with
old
men
all
right
only
let
her
be
caught
philandering
out
of
doors
again
she
be
done
for
he
her
father
would
cut
off
her
head
in
a
jiffy
had
the
like
ever
been
seen
before
a
dirty
nose
who
thought
of
beggaring
her
family
thereupon
he
shook
her
declaring
in
god
name
that
she
have
to
walk
straight
for
he
watch
her
himself
in
future
he
now
looked
her
over
every
night
when
she
came
in
even
going
so
far
as
to
sniff
at
her
and
make
her
turn
round
before
him
one
evening
she
got
another
hiding
because
he
discovered
a
mark
on
her
neck
that
he
maintained
was
the
mark
of
a
kiss
nana
insisted
it
was
a
bruise
that
leonie
had
given
her
when
they
were
having
a
bit
of
a
yet
at
other
times
her
father
would
tease
her
saying
she
was
certainly
a
choice
morsel
for
men
nana
began
to
display
the
sullen
submissiveness
of
a
trapped
animal
she
was
raging
inside
why
do
you
leave
her
alone
repeated
gervaise
who
was
more
reasonable
you
will
end
by
making
her
wish
to
do
it
by
talking
to
her
about
it
so
much
ah
yes
indeed
she
did
wish
to
do
it
she
itched
all
over
longing
to
break
loose
and
gad
all
the
time
as
father
coupeau
said
he
insisted
so
much
on
the
subject
that
even
an
honest
girl
would
have
fired
up
even
when
he
was
abusing
her
he
taught
her
a
few
things
she
did
not
know
as
yet
which
to
say
the
least
was
astonishing
then
little
by
little
she
acquired
some
singular
habits
one
morning
he
noticed
her
rummaging
in
a
paper
bag
and
rubbing
something
on
her
face
it
was
rice
powder
which
she
plastered
on
her
delicate
skin
with
perverse
taste
he
caught
up
the
paper
bag
and
rubbed
it
over
her
face
violently
enough
to
graze
her
skin
and
called
her
a
miller
daughter
on
another
occasion
she
brought
some
ribbon
home
to
do
up
her
old
black
hat
which
she
was
so
ashamed
of
he
asked
her
in
a
furious
voice
where
she
had
got
those
ribbons
from
had
she
earned
them
by
lying
on
her
back
or
had
she
bagged
them
somewhere
a
hussy
or
a
thief
and
perhaps
both
by
now
more
than
once
he
found
her
with
some
pretty
little
doodad
she
had
found
a
little
interlaced
heart
in
the
street
on
rue
her
father
crushed
the
heart
under
his
foot
driving
her
to
the
verge
of
throwing
herself
at
him
to
ruin
something
of
his
for
two
years
she
had
been
longing
for
one
of
those
hearts
and
now
he
had
smashed
it
this
was
too
much
she
was
reaching
the
end
of
the
line
with
him
coupeau
was
often
in
the
wrong
in
the
manner
in
which
he
tried
to
rule
nana
his
injustice
exasperated
her
she
at
last
left
off
attending
the
workshop
and
when
the
gave
her
a
hiding
she
declared
she
would
not
return
to
titreville
again
for
she
was
always
placed
next
to
augustine
who
must
have
swallowed
her
feet
to
have
such
a
foul
breath
then
coupeau
took
her
himself
to
the
rue
du
caire
and
requested
the
mistress
of
the
establishment
to
place
her
always
next
to
augustine
by
way
of
punishment
every
morning
for
a
fortnight
he
took
the
trouble
to
come
down
from
the
barriere
poissonniere
to
escort
nana
to
the
door
of
the
flower
shop
and
he
remained
for
five
minutes
on
the
footway
to
make
sure
that
she
had
gone
in
but
one
morning
while
he
was
drinking
a
glass
with
a
friend
in
a
wineshop
in
the
rue
he
perceived
the
hussy
darting
down
the
street
for
a
fortnight
she
had
been
deceiving
him
instead
of
going
into
the
workroom
she
climbed
a
story
higher
and
sat
down
on
the
stairs
waiting
till
he
had
gone
off
when
coupeau
began
casting
the
blame
on
madame
lerat
the
latter
flatly
replied
that
she
would
not
accept
it
she
had
told
her
niece
all
she
ought
to
tell
her
to
keep
her
on
her
guard
against
men
and
it
was
not
her
fault
if
the
girl
still
had
a
liking
for
the
nasty
beasts
now
she
washed
her
hands
of
the
whole
business
she
swore
she
would
not
mix
up
in
it
for
she
knew
what
she
knew
about
scandalmongers
in
her
own
family
yes
certain
persons
who
had
the
nerve
to
accuse
her
of
going
astray
with
nana
and
finding
an
indecent
pleasure
in
watching
her
take
her
first
misstep
then
coupeau
found
out
from
the
proprietress
that
nana
was
being
corrupted
by
that
little
floozie
leonie
who
had
given
up
to
go
on
the
street
nana
was
being
tempted
by
the
jingle
of
cash
and
the
lure
of
adventure
on
the
streets
in
the
tenement
in
the
rue
de
la
nana
old
fellow
was
talked
about
as
a
gentleman
everyone
was
acquainted
with
oh
he
remained
very
polite
even
a
little
timid
but
awfully
obstinate
and
patient
following
her
ten
paces
behind
like
an
obedient
poodle
sometimes
indeed
he
ventured
into
the
courtyard
one
evening
madame
gaudron
met
him
on
the
second
floor
landing
and
he
glided
down
alongside
the
balusters
with
his
nose
lowered
and
looking
as
if
on
fire
but
frightened
the
lorilleuxs
threatened
to
move
out
if
that
wayward
niece
of
theirs
brought
men
trailing
in
after
her
it
was
disgusting
the
staircase
was
full
of
them
the
boches
said
that
they
felt
sympathy
for
the
old
gentleman
because
he
had
fallen
for
a
tramp
he
was
really
a
respectable
businessman
they
had
seen
his
button
factory
on
the
boulevard
de
la
villette
he
would
be
an
excellent
catch
for
a
decent
girl
for
the
first
month
nana
was
greatly
amused
with
her
old
flirt
you
should
have
seen
him
always
dogging
her
a
perfect
great
nuisance
who
followed
far
behind
in
the
crowd
without
seeming
to
do
so
and
his
legs
regular
lucifers
no
more
moss
on
his
pate
only
four
straight
hairs
falling
on
his
neck
so
that
she
was
always
tempted
to
ask
him
where
his
hairdresser
lived
ah
what
an
old
gaffer
he
was
comical
and
no
mistake
nothing
to
get
excited
over
then
on
finding
him
always
behind
her
she
no
longer
thought
him
so
funny
she
became
afraid
of
him
and
would
have
called
out
if
he
had
approached
her
often
when
she
stopped
in
front
of
a
jeweler
shop
she
heard
him
stammering
something
behind
her
and
what
he
said
was
true
she
would
have
liked
to
have
had
a
cross
with
a
velvet
or
a
pair
of
coral
earrings
so
small
you
would
have
thought
they
were
drops
of
blood
more
and
more
as
she
plodded
through
the
mire
of
the
streets
getting
splashed
by
passing
vehicles
and
being
dazzled
by
the
magnificence
of
the
window
displays
she
felt
longings
that
tortured
her
like
hunger
pangs
yearnings
for
better
clothes
for
eating
in
restaurants
for
going
to
the
theatre
for
a
room
of
her
own
with
nice
furniture
right
at
those
moments
it
never
failed
that
her
old
gentleman
would
come
up
to
whisper
something
in
her
ear
oh
if
only
she
was
afraid
of
him
how
readily
she
would
have
taken
up
with
him
when
the
winter
arrived
life
became
impossible
at
home
nana
had
her
hiding
every
night
when
her
father
was
tired
of
beating
her
her
mother
smacked
her
to
teach
her
how
to
behave
and
there
were
as
soon
as
one
of
them
began
to
beat
her
the
other
took
her
part
so
that
all
three
of
them
ended
by
rolling
on
the
floor
in
the
midst
of
the
broken
crockery
and
with
all
this
there
were
short
rations
and
they
shivered
with
cold
whenever
the
girl
bought
anything
pretty
a
bow
or
a
pair
of
buttons
her
parents
confiscated
the
purchase
and
drank
what
they
could
get
for
it
she
had
nothing
of
her
own
excepting
her
allowance
of
blows
before
coiling
herself
up
between
the
rags
of
a
sheet
where
she
shivered
under
her
little
black
skirt
which
she
stretched
out
by
way
of
a
blanket
no
that
cursed
life
could
not
continue
she
was
not
going
to
leave
her
skin
in
it
her
father
had
long
since
ceased
to
count
for
her
when
a
father
gets
drunk
like
hers
did
he
is
a
father
but
a
dirty
beast
one
longs
to
be
rid
of
and
now
too
her
mother
was
doing
down
the
hill
in
her
esteem
she
drank
as
well
she
liked
to
go
and
fetch
her
husband
at
pere
colombe
so
as
to
be
treated
and
she
willingly
sat
down
with
none
of
the
air
of
disgust
that
she
had
assumed
on
the
first
occasion
draining
glasses
indeed
at
one
gulp
dragging
her
elbows
over
the
table
for
hours
and
leaving
the
place
with
her
eyes
starting
out
of
her
head
when
nana
passed
in
front
of
and
saw
her
mother
inside
with
her
nose
in
her
glass
fuddled
in
the
midst
of
the
disputing
men
she
was
seized
with
anger
for
youth
which
has
other
dainty
thoughts
uppermost
does
not
understand
drink
on
these
evenings
it
was
a
pretty
sight
father
drunk
mother
drunk
a
hell
of
a
home
that
stunk
with
liquor
and
where
there
was
no
bread
to
tell
the
truth
a
saint
would
not
have
stayed
in
the
place
so
much
the
worse
if
she
flew
the
coop
one
of
these
days
her
parents
would
have
to
say
their
and
own
that
they
had
driven
her
out
themselves
one
saturday
when
nana
came
home
she
found
her
father
and
her
mother
in
a
lamentable
condition
coupeau
who
had
fallen
across
the
bed
was
snoring
gervaise
crouching
on
a
chair
was
swaying
her
head
with
her
eyes
vaguely
and
threateningly
staring
into
vacancy
she
had
forgotten
to
warm
the
dinner
the
remains
of
a
stew
a
tallow
dip
which
she
neglected
to
snuff
revealed
the
shameful
misery
of
their
hovel
it
you
shrimp
stammered
gervaise
ah
well
your
father
will
take
care
of
you
nana
did
not
answer
but
remained
pale
looking
at
the
cold
stove
the
table
on
which
no
plates
were
laid
the
lugubrious
hovel
which
this
pair
of
drunkards
invested
with
the
pale
horror
of
their
callousness
she
did
not
take
off
her
hat
but
walked
round
the
room
then
with
her
teeth
tightly
set
she
opened
the
door
and
went
out
you
are
doing
down
again
asked
her
mother
who
was
unable
even
to
turn
her
head
yes
i
forgotten
something
i
shall
come
up
again
good
evening
and
she
did
not
return
on
the
morrow
when
the
coupeaus
were
sobered
they
fought
together
reproaching
each
other
with
being
the
cause
of
nana
flight
ah
she
was
far
away
if
she
were
running
still
as
children
are
told
of
sparrows
her
parents
might
set
a
pinch
of
salt
on
her
tail
and
then
perhaps
they
would
catch
her
it
was
a
great
blow
and
crushed
gervaise
for
despite
the
impairment
of
her
faculties
she
realized
perfectly
well
that
her
daughter
misconduct
lowered
her
still
more
she
was
alone
now
with
no
child
to
think
about
able
to
let
herself
sink
as
low
as
she
could
fall
she
drank
steadily
for
three
days
coupeau
prowled
along
the
exterior
boulevards
without
seeing
nana
and
then
came
home
to
smoke
his
pipe
peacefully
he
was
always
back
in
time
for
his
soup
in
this
tenement
where
girls
flew
off
every
month
like
canaries
whose
cages
are
left
open
no
one
was
astonished
to
hear
of
the
mishap
but
the
lorilleuxs
were
triumphant
ah
they
had
predicted
that
the
girl
would
reward
her
parents
in
this
fashion
it
was
deserved
all
artificial
went
that
way
the
boches
and
the
poissons
also
sneered
with
an
extraordinary
display
and
outlay
of
grief
lantier
alone
covertly
defended
nana
dieu
said
he
with
his
puritanical
air
no
doubt
a
girl
who
so
left
her
home
did
offend
her
parents
but
with
a
gleam
in
the
corner
of
his
eyes
he
added
that
dash
it
the
girl
was
after
all
too
pretty
to
lead
such
a
life
of
misery
at
her
age
do
you
know
cried
madame
lorilleux
one
day
in
the
boches
room
where
the
party
were
taking
coffee
well
as
sure
as
daylight
sold
her
daughter
yes
she
sold
her
and
i
have
proof
of
it
that
old
fellow
who
was
always
on
the
stairs
morning
and
night
went
up
to
pay
something
on
account
it
stares
one
in
the
face
they
were
seen
together
at
the
ambigu
theatre
the
young
wench
and
her
old
tom
cat
upon
my
word
of
honor
they
living
together
it
quite
plain
they
discussed
the
scandal
thoroughly
while
finishing
their
coffee
yes
it
was
quite
possible
soon
most
of
the
neighborhood
accepted
the
conclusion
that
gervaise
had
actually
sold
her
daughter
gervaise
now
shuffled
along
in
her
slippers
without
caring
a
rap
for
anyone
you
might
have
called
her
a
thief
in
the
street
she
have
turned
round
for
a
month
past
she
had
looked
at
madame
fauconnier
the
latter
had
had
to
turn
her
out
of
the
place
to
avoid
disputes
in
a
few
weeks
time
she
had
successively
entered
the
service
of
eight
washerwomen
she
only
lasted
two
or
three
days
in
each
place
before
she
got
the
sack
so
badly
did
she
iron
the
things
entrusted
to
her
careless
and
dirty
her
mind
failing
to
such
a
point
that
she
quite
forgot
her
own
craft
at
last
realizing
her
own
incapacity
she
abandoned
ironing
and
went
out
washing
by
the
day
at
the
in
the
rue
neuve
where
she
still
jogged
on
floundering
about
in
the
water
fighting
with
filth
reduced
to
the
roughest
but
simplest
work
a
bit
lower
on
the
slopes
the
scarcely
beautified
her
a
real
dog
when
she
came
out
of
it
soaked
and
showing
her
blue
skin
at
the
same
time
she
grew
stouter
and
stouter
despite
her
frequent
dances
before
the
empty
sideboard
and
her
leg
became
so
crooked
that
she
could
no
longer
walk
beside
anyone
without
the
risk
of
knocking
him
over
so
great
indeed
was
her
limp
naturally
enough
when
a
woman
falls
to
this
point
all
her
pride
leaves
her
gervaise
had
divested
herself
of
all
her
old
coquetry
and
need
of
sentiment
propriety
and
politeness
you
might
have
kicked
her
no
matter
where
she
did
not
feel
kicks
for
she
had
become
too
fat
and
flabby
lantier
had
altogether
neglected
her
he
no
longer
escorted
her
or
even
bothered
to
give
her
a
pinch
now
and
again
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
this
finish
of
a
long
liaison
slowly
spun
out
and
ending
in
mutual
insolence
it
was
a
chore
the
less
for
her
even
intimacy
with
virginie
left
her
quite
calm
so
great
was
her
indifference
now
for
all
that
she
had
been
so
upset
about
in
the
past
she
would
even
have
held
a
candle
for
them
now
everyone
was
aware
that
virginie
and
lantier
were
carrying
on
it
was
much
too
convenient
especially
with
poisson
on
duty
every
other
night
lantier
had
thought
of
himself
when
he
advised
virginie
to
deal
in
dainties
he
was
too
much
of
a
provincial
not
to
adore
sugared
things
and
in
fact
he
would
have
lived
off
sugar
candy
lozenges
pastilles
sugar
plums
and
chocolate
sugared
almonds
especially
left
a
little
froth
on
his
lips
so
keenly
did
they
tickle
his
palate
for
a
year
he
had
been
living
only
on
sweetmeats
he
opened
the
drawers
and
stuffed
himself
whenever
virginie
asked
him
to
mind
the
shop
often
when
he
was
talking
in
the
presence
of
five
or
six
other
people
he
would
take
the
lid
off
a
jar
on
the
counter
dip
his
hand
into
it
and
begin
to
nibble
at
something
sweet
the
glass
jar
remained
open
and
its
contents
diminished
people
ceased
paying
attention
to
it
it
was
a
mania
of
his
so
he
had
declared
besides
he
had
devised
a
perpetual
cold
an
irritation
of
the
throat
which
he
always
talked
of
calming
he
still
did
not
work
for
he
had
more
and
more
important
schemes
than
ever
in
view
he
was
contriving
a
superb
invention
the
umbrella
hat
a
hat
which
transformed
itself
into
an
umbrella
on
your
head
as
soon
as
a
shower
commenced
to
fall
and
he
promised
poisson
half
shares
in
the
profit
of
it
and
even
borrowed
twenty
franc
pieces
of
him
to
defray
the
cost
of
experiments
meanwhile
the
shop
melted
away
on
his
tongue
all
the
followed
suit
down
to
the
chocolate
cigars
and
pipes
in
pink
caramel
whenever
he
was
stuffed
with
sweetmeats
and
seized
with
a
fit
of
tenderness
he
paid
himself
with
a
last
lick
on
the
groceress
in
a
corner
who
found
him
all
sugar
with
lips
which
tasted
like
burnt
almonds
such
a
delightful
man
to
kiss
he
was
positively
becoming
all
honey
the
boches
said
he
merely
had
to
dip
a
finger
into
his
coffee
to
sweeten
it
softened
by
this
perpetual
dessert
lantier
showed
himself
paternal
towards
gervaise
he
gave
her
advice
and
scolded
her
because
she
no
longer
liked
to
work
indeed
a
woman
of
her
age
ought
to
know
how
to
turn
herself
round
and
he
accused
her
of
having
always
been
a
glutton
nevertheless
as
one
ought
to
hold
out
a
helping
hand
even
to
folks
who
do
deserve
it
he
tried
to
find
her
a
little
work
thus
he
had
prevailed
upon
virginie
to
let
gervaise
come
once
a
week
to
scrub
the
shop
and
the
rooms
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
she
understood
and
on
each
occasion
she
earned
her
thirty
sous
gervaise
arrived
on
the
saturday
morning
with
a
pail
and
a
scrubbing
brush
without
seeming
to
suffer
in
the
least
at
having
to
perform
a
dirty
humble
duty
a
charwoman
work
in
the
where
she
had
reigned
as
the
beautiful
mistress
it
was
a
last
humiliation
the
end
of
her
pride
one
saturday
she
had
a
hard
job
of
it
it
had
rained
for
three
days
and
the
customers
seemed
to
have
brought
all
the
mud
of
the
neighborhood
into
the
shop
on
the
soles
of
their
boots
virginie
was
at
the
counter
doing
the
grand
with
her
hair
well
combed
and
wearing
a
little
white
collar
and
a
pair
of
lace
cuffs
beside
her
on
the
narrow
seat
covered
with
red
lantier
did
the
dandy
looking
for
the
world
as
if
he
were
at
home
as
if
he
were
the
real
master
of
the
place
and
from
time
to
time
he
carelessly
dipped
his
hand
into
a
jar
of
peppermint
drops
just
to
nibble
something
sweet
according
to
his
habit
look
here
madame
coupeau
cried
virginie
who
was
watching
the
scrubbing
with
compressed
lips
you
have
left
some
dirt
over
there
in
the
corner
scrub
that
rather
better
please
gervaise
obeyed
she
returned
to
the
corner
and
began
to
scrub
again
she
bent
double
on
her
knees
in
the
midst
of
the
dirty
water
with
her
shoulders
protruding
her
arms
stiff
and
purple
with
cold
her
old
skirt
fairly
soaked
stuck
to
her
figure
and
there
on
the
floor
she
looked
a
dirty
drab
the
rents
in
her
jacket
showing
her
puffy
form
her
fat
flabby
flesh
which
heaved
swayed
and
floundered
about
as
she
went
about
her
work
and
all
the
while
she
perspired
to
such
a
point
that
from
her
moist
face
big
drops
of
sweat
fell
on
to
the
floor
the
more
elbow
grease
one
uses
the
more
it
shines
said
lantier
sententiously
with
his
mouth
full
of
peppermint
drops
virginie
who
sat
back
with
the
demeanor
of
a
princess
her
eyes
partly
open
was
still
watching
the
scrubbing
and
indulging
in
remarks
a
little
more
on
the
right
there
take
care
of
the
wainscot
you
know
i
was
not
very
well
pleased
last
saturday
there
were
some
stains
left
and
both
together
the
hatter
and
the
groceress
assumed
a
more
important
air
as
if
they
had
been
on
a
throne
whilst
gervaise
dragged
herself
through
the
black
mud
at
their
feet
virginie
must
have
enjoyed
herself
for
a
yellowish
flame
darted
from
her
cat
eyes
and
she
looked
at
lantier
with
an
insidious
smile
at
last
she
was
revenged
for
that
hiding
she
had
received
at
the
and
which
she
had
never
forgotten
whenever
gervaise
ceased
scrubbing
a
sound
of
sawing
could
be
heard
from
the
back
room
through
the
open
doorway
poisson
profile
stood
out
against
the
pale
light
of
the
courtyard
he
was
off
duty
that
day
and
was
profiting
by
his
leisure
time
to
indulge
in
his
mania
for
making
little
boxes
he
was
seated
at
a
table
and
was
cutting
out
arabesques
in
a
cigar
box
with
extraordinary
care
say
badingue
cried
lantier
who
had
given
him
this
surname
again
out
of
friendship
i
shall
want
that
box
of
yours
as
a
present
for
a
young
lady
virginie
gave
him
a
pinch
and
he
reached
under
the
counter
to
run
his
fingers
like
a
creeping
mouse
up
her
leg
quite
so
said
the
policeman
i
was
working
for
you
auguste
in
view
of
presenting
you
with
a
token
of
friendship
ah
if
that
the
case
i
keep
your
little
memento
rejoined
lantier
with
a
laugh
i
hang
it
round
my
neck
with
a
ribbon
then
suddenly
as
if
this
thought
brought
another
one
to
his
memory
by
the
way
he
cried
i
met
nana
last
night
this
news
caused
gervaise
such
emotion
that
she
sunk
down
in
the
dirty
water
which
covered
the
floor
of
the
shop
ah
she
muttered
speechlessly
yes
as
i
was
going
down
the
rue
des
martyrs
i
caught
sight
of
a
girl
who
was
on
the
arm
of
an
old
fellow
in
front
of
me
and
i
said
to
myself
i
know
that
shape
i
stepped
faster
and
sure
enough
found
myself
face
to
face
with
nana
there
no
need
to
pity
her
she
looked
very
happy
with
her
pretty
woolen
dress
on
her
back
a
gold
cross
and
an
awfully
pert
expression
ah
repeated
gervaise
in
a
husky
voice
lantier
who
had
finished
the
pastilles
took
some
out
of
another
jar
she
sneaky
he
resumed
she
made
a
sign
to
me
to
follow
her
with
wonderful
composure
then
she
left
her
old
fellow
somewhere
in
a
cafe
oh
a
wonderful
chap
the
old
bloke
quite
used
up
and
she
came
and
joined
me
under
the
doorway
a
pretty
little
serpent
pretty
and
doing
the
grand
and
fawning
on
you
like
a
little
dog
yes
she
kissed
me
and
wanted
to
have
news
of
everyone
i
was
very
pleased
to
meet
her
ah
said
gervaise
for
the
third
time
she
drew
herself
together
and
still
waited
had
her
daughter
had
a
word
for
her
then
in
the
silence
poisson
saw
could
be
heard
again
lantier
who
felt
gay
was
sucking
his
and
smacking
his
lips
well
if
saw
her
i
should
go
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
interposed
virginie
who
had
just
pinched
the
hatter
again
most
ferociously
it
is
because
you
are
there
madame
coupeau
but
your
daughter
is
rotten
to
the
core
why
every
day
poisson
arrests
girls
who
are
better
than
she
is
gervaise
said
nothing
nor
did
she
move
her
eyes
staring
into
space
she
ended
by
jerking
her
head
to
and
fro
as
if
in
answer
to
her
thoughts
whilst
the
hatter
with
a
gluttonous
mien
muttered
ah
a
man
would
mind
getting
a
bit
of
indigestion
from
that
sort
of
rottenness
it
as
tender
as
chicken
but
the
grocer
gave
him
such
a
terrible
look
that
he
had
to
pause
and
quiet
her
with
some
delicate
attention
he
watched
the
policeman
and
perceiving
that
he
had
his
nose
lowered
over
his
little
box
again
he
profited
of
the
opportunity
to
shove
some
into
mouth
thereupon
she
laughed
at
him
and
turned
all
her
anger
against
gervaise
just
make
haste
eh
the
work
does
do
itself
while
you
remain
stuck
there
like
a
street
post
come
look
alive
i
do
want
to
flounder
about
in
the
water
till
night
time
and
she
added
hatefully
in
a
lower
tone
it
is
my
fault
if
her
daughter
gone
and
left
her
no
doubt
gervaise
did
not
hear
she
had
begun
to
scrub
the
floor
again
with
her
back
bent
and
dragging
herself
along
with
a
motion
she
still
had
to
sweep
the
dirty
water
out
into
the
gutter
and
then
do
the
final
rinsing
after
a
pause
lantier
who
felt
bored
raised
his
voice
again
do
you
know
badingue
he
cried
i
met
your
boss
yesterday
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
he
looked
awfully
down
in
the
mouth
he
has
six
months
life
left
in
his
body
ah
after
all
with
the
life
he
leads
he
was
talking
about
the
emperor
the
policeman
did
not
raise
his
eyes
but
curtly
answered
if
you
were
the
government
you
would
be
so
fat
oh
my
dear
fellow
if
i
were
the
government
rejoined
the
hatter
suddenly
affecting
an
air
of
gravity
things
would
go
on
rather
better
i
give
you
my
word
for
it
thus
their
foreign
policy
why
for
some
time
past
it
has
been
enough
to
make
a
fellow
sweat
if
i
i
who
speak
to
you
only
knew
a
journalist
to
inspire
him
with
my
ideas
he
was
growing
animated
and
as
he
had
finished
crunching
his
he
opened
a
drawer
from
which
he
took
a
number
of
jujubes
which
he
swallowed
while
gesticulating
it
quite
simple
before
anything
else
i
should
give
poland
her
independence
again
and
i
should
establish
a
great
scandinavian
state
to
keep
the
giant
of
the
north
at
bay
then
i
should
make
a
republic
out
of
all
the
little
german
states
as
for
england
she
scarcely
to
be
feared
if
she
budged
ever
so
little
i
should
send
a
hundred
thousand
men
to
india
add
to
that
i
should
send
the
sultan
back
to
mecca
and
the
pope
to
jerusalem
belaboring
their
backs
with
the
butt
end
of
a
rifle
eh
europe
would
soon
be
clean
come
badingue
just
look
here
he
paused
to
take
five
or
six
jujubes
in
his
hand
why
it
take
longer
than
to
swallow
these
and
he
threw
one
jujube
after
another
into
his
open
mouth
the
emperor
has
another
plan
said
the
policeman
after
reflecting
for
a
couple
of
minutes
oh
forget
it
rejoined
the
hatter
we
know
what
his
plan
is
all
europe
is
laughing
at
us
every
day
the
tuileries
footmen
find
your
boss
under
the
table
between
a
couple
of
high
society
floozies
poisson
rose
to
his
feet
he
came
forward
and
placed
his
hand
on
his
heart
saying
you
hurt
me
auguste
discuss
but
do
involve
personalities
thereupon
virginie
intervened
bidding
them
stop
their
row
she
care
a
fig
for
europe
how
could
two
men
who
shared
everything
else
always
be
disputing
about
politics
for
a
minute
they
mumbled
some
indistinct
words
then
the
policeman
in
view
of
showing
that
he
harbored
no
spite
produced
the
cover
of
his
little
box
which
he
had
just
finished
it
bore
the
inscription
in
marquetry
to
auguste
a
token
of
friendship
lantier
feeling
exceedingly
flattered
lounged
back
and
spread
himself
out
so
that
he
almost
sat
upon
virginie
and
the
husband
viewed
the
scene
with
his
face
the
color
of
an
old
wall
and
his
bleared
eyes
fairly
expressionless
but
all
the
same
at
moments
the
red
hairs
of
his
moustaches
stood
up
on
end
of
their
own
accord
in
a
very
singular
fashion
which
would
have
alarmed
any
man
who
was
less
sure
of
his
business
than
the
hatter
this
beast
of
a
lantier
had
the
quiet
cheek
which
pleases
ladies
as
poisson
turned
his
back
he
was
seized
with
the
idea
of
printing
a
kiss
on
madame
poisson
left
eye
as
a
rule
he
was
stealthily
prudent
but
when
he
had
been
disputing
about
politics
he
risked
everything
so
as
to
show
the
wife
his
superiority
these
gloating
caresses
cheekily
stolen
behind
the
policeman
back
revenged
him
on
the
empire
which
had
turned
france
into
a
house
of
quarrels
only
on
this
occasion
he
had
forgotten
gervaise
presence
she
had
just
finished
rinsing
and
wiping
the
shop
and
she
stood
near
the
counter
waiting
for
her
thirty
sous
however
the
kiss
on
virginie
eye
left
her
perfectly
calm
as
being
quite
natural
and
as
part
of
a
business
she
had
no
right
to
mix
herself
up
in
virginie
seemed
rather
vexed
she
threw
the
thirty
sous
on
to
the
counter
in
front
of
gervaise
the
latter
did
not
budge
but
stood
there
waiting
still
palpitating
with
the
effort
she
had
made
in
scrubbing
and
looking
as
soaked
and
as
ugly
as
a
dog
fished
out
of
the
sewer
then
she
did
tell
you
anything
she
asked
the
hatter
at
last
who
he
cried
ah
yes
you
mean
nana
no
nothing
else
what
a
tempting
mouth
she
has
the
little
hussy
real
strawberry
jam
gervaise
went
off
with
her
thirty
sous
in
her
hand
the
holes
in
her
shoes
spat
water
forth
like
pumps
they
were
real
musical
shoes
and
played
a
tune
as
they
left
moist
traces
of
their
broad
soles
along
the
pavement
in
the
neighborhood
the
feminine
tipplers
of
her
own
class
now
related
that
she
drank
to
console
herself
for
her
daughter
misconduct
she
herself
when
she
gulped
down
her
dram
of
spirits
on
the
counter
assumed
a
dramatic
air
and
tossed
the
liquor
into
her
mouth
wishing
it
would
do
for
her
and
on
the
days
when
she
came
home
boozed
she
stammered
that
it
was
all
through
grief
but
honest
folks
shrugged
their
shoulders
they
knew
what
that
meant
ascribing
the
effects
of
the
peppery
fire
of
to
grief
indeed
at
all
events
she
ought
to
have
called
it
bottled
grief
no
doubt
at
the
beginning
she
digest
nana
flight
all
the
honest
feelings
remaining
in
her
revolted
at
the
thought
and
besides
as
a
rule
a
mother
does
like
to
have
to
think
that
her
daughter
at
that
very
moment
perhaps
is
being
familiarly
addressed
by
the
first
chance
comer
but
gervaise
was
already
too
stultified
with
a
sick
head
and
a
crushed
heart
to
think
of
the
shame
for
long
with
her
it
came
and
went
she
remained
sometimes
for
a
week
together
without
thinking
of
her
daughter
and
then
suddenly
a
tender
or
an
angry
feeling
seized
hold
of
her
sometimes
when
she
had
her
stomach
empty
at
others
when
it
was
full
a
furious
longing
to
catch
nana
in
some
corner
where
she
would
perhaps
have
kissed
her
or
perhaps
have
beaten
her
according
to
the
fancy
of
the
moment
whenever
these
thoughts
came
over
her
gervaise
looked
on
all
sides
in
the
streets
with
the
eyes
of
a
detective
ah
if
she
had
only
seen
her
little
sinner
how
quickly
she
would
have
brought
her
home
again
the
neighborhood
was
being
turned
that
year
the
boulevard
magenta
and
the
boulevard
ornano
were
being
pierced
they
were
doing
away
with
the
old
barriere
poissonniere
and
cutting
right
through
the
outer
boulevard
the
district
could
not
be
recognized
the
whole
of
one
side
of
the
rue
des
poissonniers
had
been
pulled
down
from
the
rue
de
la
a
large
clearing
could
now
be
seen
a
dash
of
sunlight
and
open
air
and
in
place
of
the
gloomy
buildings
which
had
hidden
the
view
in
this
direction
there
rose
up
on
the
boulevard
ornano
a
perfect
monument
a
house
carved
all
over
like
a
church
with
clear
windows
which
with
their
embroidered
curtains
seemed
symbolical
of
wealth
this
white
house
standing
just
in
front
of
the
street
illuminated
it
with
a
jet
of
light
as
it
were
and
every
day
it
caused
discussions
between
lantier
and
poisson
gervaise
had
several
times
had
tidings
of
nana
there
are
always
ready
tongues
anxious
to
pay
you
a
sorry
compliment
yes
she
had
been
told
that
the
hussy
had
left
her
old
gentleman
just
like
the
inexperienced
girl
she
was
she
had
gotten
along
famously
with
him
petted
adored
and
free
too
if
she
had
only
known
how
to
manage
the
situation
but
youth
is
foolish
and
she
had
no
doubt
gone
off
with
some
young
rake
no
one
knew
exactly
where
what
seemed
certain
was
that
one
afternoon
she
had
left
her
old
fellow
on
the
place
de
la
bastille
just
for
half
a
minute
and
he
was
still
waiting
for
her
to
return
other
persons
swore
they
had
seen
her
since
dancing
on
her
heels
at
the
grand
hall
of
folly
in
the
rue
de
la
chapelle
then
it
was
that
gervaise
took
it
into
her
head
to
frequent
all
the
dancing
places
of
the
neighborhood
she
did
not
pass
in
front
of
a
public
without
going
in
coupeau
accompanied
her
at
first
they
merely
made
the
round
of
the
room
looking
at
the
drabs
who
were
jumping
about
but
one
evening
as
they
had
some
coin
they
sat
down
and
ordered
a
large
bowl
of
hot
wine
in
view
of
regaling
themselves
and
waiting
to
see
if
nana
would
turn
up
at
the
end
of
a
month
or
so
they
had
practically
forgotten
her
but
they
frequented
the
halls
for
their
own
pleasure
liking
to
look
at
the
dancers
they
would
remain
for
hours
without
exchanging
a
word
resting
their
elbows
on
the
table
stultified
amidst
the
quaking
of
the
floor
and
yet
no
doubt
amusing
themselves
as
they
stared
with
pale
eyes
at
the
barriere
women
in
the
stifling
atmosphere
and
ruddy
glow
of
the
hall
it
happened
one
november
evening
that
they
went
into
the
grand
hall
of
folly
to
warm
themselves
out
of
doors
a
sharp
wind
cut
you
across
the
face
but
the
hall
was
crammed
there
was
a
thundering
big
swarm
inside
people
at
all
the
tables
people
in
the
middle
people
up
above
quite
an
amount
of
flesh
yes
those
who
cared
for
tripes
could
enjoy
themselves
when
they
had
made
the
round
twice
without
finding
a
vacant
table
they
decided
to
remain
standing
and
wait
till
somebody
went
off
coupeau
was
teetering
on
his
legs
in
a
dirty
blouse
with
an
old
cloth
cap
which
had
lost
its
peak
flattened
down
on
his
head
and
as
he
blocked
the
way
he
saw
a
scraggy
young
fellow
who
was
wiping
his
after
elbowing
him
say
cried
coupeau
in
a
fury
as
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
black
mouth
ca
you
apologize
and
you
play
the
disgusted
one
just
because
a
fellow
wears
a
blouse
the
young
man
turned
round
and
looked
at
the
from
head
to
foot
i
just
teach
you
you
scraggy
young
scamp
continued
coupeau
that
the
blouse
is
the
finest
garment
out
yes
the
garment
of
work
wipe
you
if
you
like
with
my
fists
did
one
ever
hear
of
such
a
thing
a
insulting
a
workman
gervaise
tried
to
calm
him
but
in
vain
he
drew
himself
up
in
his
rags
in
full
view
and
struck
his
blouse
roaring
there
a
man
chest
under
that
thereupon
the
young
man
dived
into
the
midst
of
the
crowd
muttering
what
a
dirty
blackguard
coupeau
wanted
to
follow
and
catch
him
he
was
going
to
let
himself
be
insulted
by
a
fellow
with
a
coat
on
probably
it
was
even
paid
for
some
toggery
to
impress
a
girl
with
without
having
to
fork
out
a
centime
if
he
caught
the
chap
again
he
bring
him
down
on
his
knees
and
make
him
bow
to
the
blouse
but
the
crush
was
too
great
there
was
no
means
of
walking
he
and
gervaise
turned
slowly
round
the
dancers
there
were
three
rows
of
sightseers
packed
close
together
whose
faces
lighted
up
whenever
any
of
the
dancers
showed
off
as
coupeau
and
gervaise
were
both
short
they
raised
themselves
up
on
tiptoe
trying
to
see
something
besides
the
chignons
and
hats
that
were
bobbing
about
the
cracked
brass
instruments
of
the
orchestra
were
furiously
thundering
a
quadrille
a
perfect
tempest
which
made
the
hall
shake
while
the
dancers
striking
the
floor
with
their
feet
raised
a
cloud
of
dust
which
dimmed
the
brightness
of
the
gas
the
heat
was
unbearable
look
there
said
gervaise
suddenly
look
at
what
why
at
that
velvet
hat
over
there
they
raised
themselves
up
on
tiptoe
on
the
left
hand
there
was
an
old
black
velvet
hat
trimmed
with
ragged
feathers
bobbing
about
regular
hearse
plumes
it
was
dancing
a
devil
of
a
dance
this
hat
bouncing
and
whirling
round
diving
down
and
then
springing
up
again
coupeau
and
gervaise
lost
sight
of
it
as
the
people
round
about
moved
their
heads
but
then
suddenly
they
saw
it
again
swaying
farther
off
with
such
droll
effrontery
that
folks
laughed
merely
at
the
sight
of
this
dancing
hat
without
knowing
what
was
underneath
it
well
asked
coupeau
do
you
recognize
that
head
of
hair
muttered
gervaise
in
a
stifled
voice
may
my
head
be
cut
off
if
it
is
her
with
one
shove
the
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
dieu
yes
it
was
nana
and
in
a
nice
pickle
too
she
had
nothing
on
her
back
but
an
old
silk
dress
all
stained
and
sticky
from
having
wiped
the
tables
of
boozing
dens
and
with
its
flounces
so
torn
that
they
fell
in
tatters
round
about
not
even
a
bit
of
a
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
to
think
that
the
hussy
had
had
such
an
attentive
loving
gentleman
and
had
yet
fallen
to
this
condition
merely
for
the
sake
of
following
some
rascal
who
had
beaten
her
no
doubt
nevertheless
she
had
remained
fresh
and
insolent
with
her
hair
as
frizzy
as
a
poodle
and
her
mouth
bright
pink
under
that
rascally
hat
of
hers
just
wait
a
bit
i
make
her
dance
resumed
coupeau
naturally
enough
nana
was
not
on
her
guard
you
should
have
seen
how
she
wriggled
about
she
twisted
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
bending
double
as
if
she
were
going
to
break
herself
in
two
and
kicking
her
feet
as
high
as
her
partner
face
a
circle
had
formed
about
her
and
this
excited
her
even
more
she
raised
her
skirts
to
her
knees
and
really
let
herself
go
in
a
wild
dance
whirling
and
turning
dropping
to
the
floor
in
splits
and
then
jigging
and
bouncing
coupeau
was
trying
to
force
his
way
through
the
dancers
and
was
disrupting
the
quadrille
i
tell
you
it
my
daughter
he
cried
let
me
pass
nana
was
now
dancing
backwards
sweeping
the
floor
with
her
flounces
rounding
her
figure
and
wriggling
it
so
as
to
look
all
the
more
tempting
she
suddenly
received
a
masterly
blow
just
on
the
right
cheek
she
raised
herself
up
and
turned
quite
pale
on
recognizing
her
father
and
mother
bad
luck
and
no
mistake
turn
him
out
howled
the
dancers
but
coupeau
who
had
just
recognized
his
daughter
cavalier
as
the
scraggy
young
man
in
the
coat
did
not
care
a
fig
for
what
the
people
said
yes
it
us
he
roared
eh
you
did
expect
it
so
we
catch
you
here
and
with
a
too
who
insulted
me
a
little
while
ago
gervaise
whose
teeth
were
tight
set
pushed
him
aside
exclaiming
shut
up
there
no
need
of
so
much
explanation
and
stepping
forward
she
dealt
nana
a
couple
of
hearty
cuffs
the
first
knocked
the
feathered
hat
on
one
side
and
the
second
left
a
red
mark
on
the
girl
white
cheek
nana
was
too
stupefied
either
to
cry
or
resist
the
orchestra
continued
playing
the
crowd
grew
angry
and
repeated
savagely
turn
them
out
turn
them
out
come
make
haste
resumed
gervaise
just
walk
in
front
and
do
try
to
run
off
you
shall
sleep
in
prison
if
you
do
the
scraggy
young
man
had
prudently
disappeared
nana
walked
ahead
very
stiff
and
still
stupefied
by
her
bad
luck
whenever
she
showed
the
lest
unwillingness
a
cuff
from
behind
brought
her
back
to
the
direction
of
the
door
and
thus
they
went
out
all
three
of
them
amid
the
jeers
and
banter
of
the
spectators
whilst
the
orchestra
finished
playing
the
finale
with
such
thunder
that
the
trombones
seemed
to
be
spitting
bullets
the
old
life
began
again
after
sleeping
for
twelve
hours
in
her
closet
nana
behaved
very
well
for
a
week
or
so
she
had
patched
herself
a
modest
little
dress
and
wore
a
cap
with
the
strings
tied
under
her
chignon
seized
indeed
with
remarkable
fervor
she
declared
she
would
work
at
home
where
one
could
earn
what
one
liked
without
hearing
any
nasty
talk
and
she
procured
some
work
and
installed
herself
at
a
table
getting
up
at
five
in
the
morning
on
the
first
few
days
to
roll
her
sprigs
of
violets
but
when
she
had
delivered
a
few
gross
she
stretched
her
arms
and
yawned
over
her
work
with
her
hands
cramped
for
she
had
lost
her
knack
of
and
suffocated
shut
up
like
this
at
home
after
allowing
herself
so
much
open
air
freedom
during
the
last
six
months
then
the
glue
dried
the
petals
and
the
green
paper
got
stained
with
grease
and
the
came
three
times
in
person
to
make
a
row
and
claim
his
spoiled
materials
nana
idled
along
constantly
getting
a
hiding
from
her
father
and
wrangling
with
her
mother
morning
and
night
quarrels
in
which
the
two
women
flung
horrible
words
at
each
other
head
it
could
last
the
twelfth
day
she
took
herself
off
with
no
more
luggage
than
her
modest
dress
on
her
back
and
her
cap
perched
over
one
ear
the
lorilleuxs
who
had
pursed
their
lips
on
hearing
of
her
return
and
repentance
nearly
died
of
laughter
now
second
performance
eclipse
number
two
all
aboard
for
the
train
for
the
for
streetwalkers
no
it
was
really
too
comical
nana
took
herself
off
in
such
an
amusing
style
well
if
the
coupeaus
wanted
to
keep
her
in
the
future
they
must
shut
her
up
in
a
cage
in
the
presence
of
other
people
the
coupeaus
pretended
they
were
very
glad
to
be
rid
of
the
girl
though
in
reality
they
were
enraged
however
rage
ca
last
forever
and
soon
they
heard
without
even
blinking
that
nana
was
seen
in
the
neighborhood
gervaise
who
accused
her
of
doing
it
to
enrage
them
set
herself
above
the
scandal
she
might
meet
her
daughter
on
the
street
she
said
she
would
even
dirty
her
hand
to
cuff
her
yes
it
was
all
over
she
might
have
seen
her
lying
in
the
gutter
dying
on
the
pavement
and
she
would
have
passed
by
without
even
admitting
that
such
a
hussy
was
her
own
child
nana
meanwhile
was
enlivening
the
dancing
halls
of
the
neighborhood
she
was
known
from
the
ball
of
queen
blanche
to
the
great
hall
of
folly
when
she
entered
the
folks
climbed
onto
the
tables
to
see
her
do
the
sniffling
crawfish
during
the
pastourelle
as
she
had
twice
been
turned
out
of
the
chateau
rouge
hall
she
walked
outside
the
door
waiting
for
someone
she
knew
to
escort
her
inside
the
black
ball
on
the
outer
boulevard
and
the
grand
turk
in
the
rue
des
poissonniers
were
respectable
places
where
she
only
went
when
she
had
some
fine
dress
on
of
all
the
jumping
places
of
the
neighborhood
however
those
she
most
preferred
were
the
hermitage
ball
in
a
damp
courtyard
and
robert
ball
in
the
impasse
du
cadran
two
dirty
little
halls
lighted
up
with
a
half
dozen
oil
lamps
and
kept
very
informally
everyone
pleased
and
everyone
free
so
much
so
that
the
men
and
their
girls
kissed
each
other
at
their
ease
in
the
dances
without
being
disturbed
nana
had
ups
and
downs
perfect
transformations
now
tricked
out
like
a
stylish
woman
and
now
all
dirt
ah
she
had
a
fine
life
on
several
occasions
the
coupeaus
fancied
they
saw
her
in
some
shady
dive
they
turned
their
backs
and
decamped
in
another
direction
so
as
not
to
be
obliged
to
recognize
her
they
did
care
to
be
laughed
at
by
a
whole
dancing
hall
again
for
the
sake
of
bringing
such
a
dolt
home
one
night
as
they
were
going
to
bed
however
someone
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
nana
who
came
to
ask
for
a
bed
and
in
what
a
state
dieu
her
head
was
bare
her
dress
in
tatters
and
her
boots
full
of
holes
such
a
toilet
as
might
have
led
the
police
to
run
her
in
and
take
her
off
to
the
depot
naturally
enough
she
received
a
hiding
and
then
she
gluttonously
fell
on
a
crust
of
stale
bread
and
went
to
sleep
worn
out
with
the
last
mouthful
between
her
teeth
then
this
sort
of
life
continued
as
soon
as
she
was
somewhat
recovered
she
would
go
off
and
not
a
sight
or
sound
of
her
weeks
or
months
would
pass
and
she
would
suddenly
appear
with
no
explanation
the
coupeaus
got
used
to
these
comings
and
goings
well
as
long
as
she
did
leave
the
door
open
what
could
you
expect
there
was
only
one
thing
that
really
bothered
gervaise
this
was
to
see
her
daughter
come
home
in
a
dress
with
a
train
and
a
hat
covered
with
feathers
no
she
could
stomach
this
display
nana
might
indulge
in
riotous
living
if
she
chose
but
when
she
came
home
to
her
mother
she
ought
to
dress
like
a
workgirl
the
dresses
with
trains
caused
quite
a
sensation
in
the
house
the
lorilleuxs
sneered
lantier
whose
mouth
sneered
turned
the
girl
round
to
sniff
at
her
delicious
aroma
the
boches
had
forbidden
pauline
to
associate
with
this
baggage
in
her
frippery
and
gervaise
was
also
angered
by
nana
exhausted
slumber
when
after
one
of
her
adventures
she
slept
till
noon
with
her
chignon
undone
and
still
full
of
hair
pins
looking
so
white
and
breathing
so
feebly
that
she
seemed
to
be
dead
her
mother
shook
her
five
or
six
times
in
the
course
of
the
morning
threatening
to
throw
a
jugful
of
water
over
her
the
sight
of
this
handsome
lazy
girl
half
naked
and
besotted
with
wine
exasperated
her
as
she
saw
her
lying
there
sometimes
nana
opened
an
eye
closed
it
again
and
then
stretched
herself
out
all
the
more
one
day
after
reproaching
her
with
the
life
she
led
and
asking
her
if
she
had
taken
on
an
entire
battalion
of
soldiers
gervaise
put
her
threat
into
execution
to
the
extent
of
shaking
her
dripping
hand
over
nana
body
quite
infuriated
the
girl
pulled
herself
up
in
the
sheet
and
cried
out
that
enough
mamma
it
would
be
better
not
to
talk
of
men
you
did
as
you
liked
and
now
i
do
the
same
what
what
stammered
the
mother
yes
i
never
spoke
to
you
about
it
for
it
did
concern
me
but
you
did
used
to
be
very
fussy
i
often
saw
you
when
we
lived
at
the
shop
sneaking
off
as
soon
as
papa
started
snoring
so
just
shut
up
you
should
have
set
me
the
example
gervaise
remained
pale
with
trembling
hands
turning
round
without
knowing
what
she
was
about
whilst
nana
flattened
on
her
breast
embraced
her
pillow
with
both
arms
and
subsided
into
the
torpor
of
her
leaden
slumber
coupeau
growled
no
longer
sane
enough
to
think
of
launching
out
a
whack
he
was
altogether
losing
his
mind
and
really
there
was
no
need
to
call
him
an
unprincipled
father
for
liquor
had
deprived
him
of
all
consciousness
of
good
and
evil
now
it
was
a
settled
thing
he
was
sober
once
in
six
months
then
he
was
laid
up
and
had
to
go
into
the
hospital
a
pleasure
trip
for
him
the
lorilleuxs
said
that
the
duke
of
had
gone
to
visit
his
estates
at
the
end
of
a
few
weeks
he
left
the
asylum
repaired
and
set
together
again
and
then
he
began
to
pull
himself
to
bits
once
more
till
he
was
down
on
his
back
and
needed
another
mending
in
three
years
he
went
seven
times
to
in
this
fashion
the
neighborhood
said
that
his
cell
was
kept
ready
for
him
but
the
worst
of
the
matter
was
that
this
obstinate
tippler
demolished
himself
more
and
more
each
time
so
that
from
relapse
to
relapse
one
could
foresee
the
final
tumble
the
last
cracking
of
this
shaky
cask
all
the
hoops
of
which
were
breaking
away
one
after
the
other
at
the
same
time
he
forgot
to
improve
in
appearance
a
perfect
ghost
to
look
at
the
poison
was
having
terrible
effects
by
dint
of
imbibing
alcohol
his
body
shrunk
up
like
the
embryos
displayed
in
glass
jars
in
chemical
laboratories
when
he
approached
a
window
you
could
see
through
his
ribs
so
skinny
had
he
become
those
who
knew
his
age
only
forty
years
just
gone
shuddered
when
he
passed
by
bent
and
unsteady
looking
as
old
as
the
streets
themselves
and
the
trembling
of
his
hands
increased
the
right
one
danced
to
such
an
extent
that
sometimes
he
had
to
take
his
glass
between
both
fists
to
carry
it
to
his
lips
oh
that
cursed
trembling
it
was
the
only
thing
that
worried
his
addled
brains
you
could
hear
him
growling
ferocious
insults
against
those
hands
of
his
this
last
summer
during
which
nana
usually
came
home
to
spend
her
nights
after
she
had
finished
knocking
about
was
especially
bad
for
coupeau
his
voice
changed
entirely
as
if
liquor
had
set
a
new
music
in
his
throat
he
became
deaf
in
one
ear
then
in
a
few
days
his
sight
grew
dim
and
he
had
to
clutch
hold
of
the
stair
railings
to
prevent
himself
from
falling
as
for
his
health
he
had
abominable
headaches
and
dizziness
all
on
a
sudden
he
was
seized
with
acute
pains
in
his
arms
and
legs
he
turned
pale
was
obliged
to
sit
down
and
remained
on
a
chair
witless
for
hours
indeed
after
one
such
attack
his
arm
remained
paralyzed
for
the
whole
day
he
took
to
his
bed
several
times
he
rolled
himself
up
and
hid
himself
under
the
sheet
breathing
hard
and
continuously
like
a
suffering
animal
then
the
strange
scenes
of
began
again
suspicious
and
nervous
worried
with
a
burning
fever
he
rolled
about
in
a
mad
rage
tearing
his
blouse
and
biting
the
furniture
with
his
convulsed
jaws
or
else
he
sank
into
a
great
state
of
emotion
complaining
like
a
child
sobbing
and
lamenting
because
nobody
loved
him
one
night
when
gervaise
and
nana
returned
home
together
they
were
surprised
not
to
find
him
in
his
bed
he
had
laid
the
bolster
in
his
place
and
when
they
discovered
him
hiding
between
the
bed
and
the
wall
his
teeth
were
chattering
and
he
related
that
some
men
had
come
to
murder
him
the
two
women
were
obliged
to
put
him
to
bed
again
and
quiet
him
like
a
child
coupeau
knew
only
one
remedy
to
toss
down
a
pint
of
spirits
a
whack
in
his
stomach
which
set
him
on
his
feet
again
this
was
how
he
doctored
his
gripes
of
a
morning
his
memory
had
left
him
long
ago
his
brain
was
empty
and
he
no
sooner
found
himself
on
his
feet
than
he
poked
fun
at
illness
he
had
never
been
ill
yes
he
had
got
to
the
point
when
a
fellow
kicks
the
bucket
declaring
that
he
quite
well
and
his
wits
were
going
in
other
respects
too
when
nana
came
home
after
gadding
about
for
six
weeks
or
so
he
seemed
to
fancy
she
had
returned
from
doing
some
errand
in
the
neighborhood
often
when
she
was
hanging
on
an
acquaintance
arm
she
met
him
and
laughed
at
him
without
his
recognizing
her
in
short
he
no
longer
counted
for
anything
she
might
have
sat
down
on
him
if
she
had
been
at
a
loss
for
a
chair
when
the
first
frosts
came
nana
took
herself
off
once
more
under
the
pretence
of
going
to
the
fruiterer
to
see
if
there
were
any
baked
pears
she
scented
winter
and
did
care
to
let
her
teeth
chatter
in
front
of
the
fireless
stove
the
coupeaus
had
called
her
no
good
because
they
had
waited
for
the
pears
no
doubt
she
would
come
back
again
the
other
winter
she
had
stayed
away
three
weeks
to
fetch
her
father
two
sous
worth
of
tobacco
but
the
months
went
by
and
the
girl
did
not
show
herself
this
time
she
must
have
indulged
in
a
hard
gallop
when
june
arrived
she
did
not
even
turn
up
with
the
sunshine
evidently
it
was
all
over
she
had
found
a
new
meal
ticket
somewhere
or
other
one
day
when
the
coupeaus
were
totally
broke
they
sold
nana
iron
bedstead
for
six
francs
which
they
drank
together
at
the
bedstead
had
been
in
their
way
one
morning
in
july
virginie
called
to
gervaise
who
was
passing
by
and
asked
her
to
lend
a
hand
in
washing
up
for
lantier
had
entertained
a
couple
of
friends
on
the
day
before
and
while
gervaise
was
cleaning
up
the
plates
and
dishes
greasy
with
the
traces
of
the
spread
the
hatter
who
was
still
digesting
in
the
shop
suddenly
called
out
say
i
saw
nana
the
other
day
virginie
who
was
seated
at
the
counter
looking
very
careworn
in
front
of
the
jars
and
drawers
which
were
already
three
parts
emptied
jerked
her
head
furiously
she
restrained
herself
so
as
not
to
say
too
much
but
really
it
was
angering
her
lantier
was
seeing
nana
often
oh
she
was
by
no
means
sure
of
him
he
was
a
man
to
do
much
worse
than
that
when
a
fancy
for
a
woman
came
into
his
head
madame
lerat
very
intimate
just
then
with
virginie
who
confided
in
her
had
that
moment
entered
the
shop
and
hearing
lantier
remark
she
pouted
ridiculously
and
asked
what
do
you
mean
you
saw
her
oh
in
the
street
here
answered
the
hatter
who
felt
highly
flattered
and
began
to
laugh
and
twirl
his
moustaches
she
was
in
a
carriage
and
i
was
floundering
on
the
pavement
really
it
was
so
i
swear
it
there
no
use
denying
it
the
young
fellows
of
position
who
are
on
friendly
terms
with
her
are
terribly
lucky
his
eyes
had
brightened
and
he
turned
towards
gervaise
who
was
standing
in
the
rear
of
the
shop
wiping
a
dish
yes
she
was
in
a
carriage
and
wore
such
a
stylish
dress
i
recognise
her
she
looked
so
much
like
a
lady
of
the
upper
set
with
her
white
teeth
and
her
face
as
fresh
as
a
flower
it
was
she
who
waved
her
glove
to
me
she
has
caught
a
count
i
believe
oh
she
launched
for
good
she
can
afford
to
do
without
any
of
us
she
head
over
heels
in
happiness
the
little
beggar
what
a
love
of
a
little
kitten
no
no
idea
what
a
little
kitten
she
is
gervaise
was
still
wiping
the
same
plate
although
it
had
long
since
been
clean
and
shiny
virginie
was
reflecting
anxious
about
a
couple
of
bills
which
fell
due
on
the
morrow
and
which
she
did
know
how
to
pay
whilst
lantier
stout
and
fat
perspiring
the
sugar
he
fed
off
ventured
his
enthusiasm
for
little
hussies
the
shop
which
was
already
three
parts
eaten
up
smelt
of
ruin
yes
there
were
only
a
few
more
burnt
almonds
to
nibble
a
little
more
to
suck
to
clean
the
poissons
business
out
suddenly
on
the
pavement
over
the
way
he
perceived
the
policeman
who
was
on
duty
pass
by
all
buttoned
up
with
his
sword
dangling
by
his
side
and
this
made
him
all
the
gayer
he
compelled
virginie
to
look
at
her
husband
dear
me
he
muttered
badingue
looks
fine
this
morning
just
look
see
how
stiff
he
walks
he
must
have
stuck
a
glass
eye
in
his
back
to
surprise
people
when
gervaise
went
back
upstairs
she
found
coupeau
seated
on
the
bed
in
the
torpid
state
induced
by
one
of
his
attacks
he
was
looking
at
the
with
his
dim
expressionless
eyes
she
sat
herself
down
on
a
chair
tired
out
her
hands
hanging
beside
her
dirty
skirt
and
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
remained
in
front
of
him
without
saying
a
word
i
had
some
news
she
muttered
at
last
your
daughter
been
seen
yes
your
daughter
precious
stylish
and
has
any
more
need
of
you
she
awfully
happy
she
is
ah
dieu
i
give
a
great
deal
to
be
in
her
place
coupeau
was
still
staring
at
the
but
suddenly
he
raised
his
ravaged
face
and
stammered
with
an
idiotic
laugh
well
my
little
lamb
i
not
stopping
you
you
not
yet
so
bad
looking
when
you
wash
yourself
as
folks
say
however
old
a
pot
may
be
it

chapter
xii
it
must
have
been
the
saturday
after
quarter
day
something
like
the
or
of
january
gervaise
did
quite
know
she
was
losing
her
wits
for
it
was
centuries
since
she
had
had
anything
warm
in
her
stomach
ah
what
an
infernal
week
a
complete
clear
out
two
loaves
of
four
pounds
each
on
tuesday
which
had
lasted
till
thursday
then
a
dry
crust
found
the
night
before
and
finally
not
a
crumb
for
hours
a
real
dance
before
the
cupboard
what
did
she
know
by
the
way
what
she
felt
on
her
back
was
the
frightful
cold
a
black
cold
the
sky
as
grimy
as
a
thick
with
snow
which
obstinately
refused
to
fall
when
winter
and
hunger
are
both
together
in
your
guts
you
may
tighten
your
belt
as
much
as
you
like
it
hardly
feeds
you
perhaps
coupeau
would
bring
back
some
money
in
the
evening
he
said
that
he
was
working
anything
is
possible
is
it
and
gervaise
although
she
had
been
caught
many
and
many
a
time
had
ended
by
relying
on
this
coin
after
all
sorts
of
incidents
she
herself
could
find
as
much
as
a
duster
to
wash
in
the
whole
neighborhood
and
even
an
old
lady
whose
rooms
she
did
had
just
given
her
the
sack
charging
her
with
swilling
her
liqueurs
no
one
would
engage
her
she
was
washed
up
everywhere
and
this
secretly
suited
her
for
she
had
fallen
to
that
state
of
indifference
when
one
prefers
to
croak
rather
than
move
one
fingers
at
all
events
if
coupeau
brought
his
pay
home
they
would
have
something
warm
to
eat
and
meanwhile
as
it
was
yet
noon
she
remained
stretched
on
the
mattress
for
one
does
feel
so
cold
or
so
hungry
when
one
is
lying
down
the
bed
was
nothing
but
a
pile
of
straw
in
a
corner
bed
and
bedding
had
gone
piece
by
piece
to
the
dealers
of
the
neighborhood
first
she
had
ripped
open
the
mattress
to
sell
handfuls
of
wool
at
ten
sous
a
pound
when
the
mattress
was
empty
she
got
thirty
sous
for
the
sack
so
as
to
be
able
to
have
coffee
everything
else
had
followed
well
was
the
straw
good
enough
for
them
gervaise
bent
herself
like
a
on
the
heap
of
straw
with
her
clothes
on
and
her
feet
drawn
up
under
her
rag
of
a
skirt
so
as
to
keep
them
warm
and
huddled
up
with
her
eyes
wide
open
she
turned
some
scarcely
amusing
ideas
over
in
her
mind
that
morning
ah
no
they
could
continue
living
without
food
she
no
longer
felt
her
hunger
only
she
had
a
leaden
weight
on
her
chest
and
her
brain
seemed
empty
certainly
there
was
nothing
gay
to
look
at
in
the
four
corners
of
the
hovel
a
perfect
kennel
now
where
greyhounds
who
wear
wrappers
in
the
streets
would
not
even
have
lived
in
effigy
her
pale
eyes
stared
at
the
bare
walls
everything
had
long
since
gone
to
uncle
all
that
remained
were
the
chest
of
drawers
the
table
and
a
chair
even
the
marble
top
of
the
chest
of
drawers
and
the
drawers
themselves
had
evaporated
in
the
same
direction
as
the
bedstead
a
fire
could
not
have
cleaned
them
out
more
completely
the
little
had
melted
beginning
with
the
ticker
a
twelve
franc
watch
down
to
the
family
photos
the
frames
of
which
had
been
bought
by
a
woman
keeping
a
store
a
very
obliging
woman
by
the
way
to
whom
gervaise
carried
a
saucepan
an
iron
a
comb
and
who
gave
her
five
three
or
two
sous
in
exchange
according
to
the
article
enough
at
all
events
to
go
upstairs
again
with
a
bit
of
bread
but
now
there
only
remained
a
broken
pair
of
candle
snuffers
which
the
woman
refused
to
give
her
even
a
sou
for
oh
if
she
could
only
have
sold
the
rubbish
and
refuse
the
dust
and
the
dirt
how
speedily
she
would
have
opened
shop
for
the
room
was
filthy
to
behold
she
only
saw
cobwebs
in
the
corners
and
although
cobwebs
are
good
for
cuts
there
are
so
far
no
merchants
who
buy
them
then
turning
her
head
abandoning
the
idea
of
doing
a
bit
of
trade
gervaise
gathered
herself
together
more
closely
on
her
straw
preferring
to
stare
through
the
window
at
the
sky
at
the
dreary
daylight
which
froze
the
marrow
in
her
bones
what
a
lot
of
worry
though
after
all
what
was
the
use
of
putting
herself
in
such
a
state
and
puzzling
her
brains
if
she
had
only
been
able
to
have
a
snooze
but
her
hole
of
a
home
would
go
out
of
her
mind
monsieur
marescot
the
landlord
had
come
in
person
the
day
before
to
tell
them
that
he
would
turn
them
out
into
the
street
if
the
two
quarters
rent
now
overdue
were
not
paid
during
the
ensuing
week
well
so
he
might
they
certainly
could
be
worse
off
on
the
pavement
fancy
this
ape
in
his
overcoat
and
his
woolen
gloves
coming
upstairs
to
talk
to
them
about
rent
as
if
they
had
had
a
treasure
hidden
somewhere
just
the
same
with
that
brute
of
a
coupeau
who
could
come
home
now
without
beating
her
she
wished
him
in
the
same
place
as
the
landlord
she
sent
them
all
there
wishing
to
rid
herself
of
everyone
and
of
life
too
she
was
becoming
a
real
storehouse
for
blows
coupeau
had
a
cudgel
which
he
called
his
ass
fan
and
he
fanned
his
old
woman
you
should
just
have
seen
him
giving
her
abominable
thrashings
which
made
her
perspire
all
over
she
was
no
better
herself
for
she
bit
and
scratched
him
then
they
stamped
about
in
the
empty
room
and
gave
each
other
such
drubbings
as
were
likely
to
ease
them
of
all
taste
for
bread
for
good
but
gervaise
ended
by
not
caring
a
fig
for
these
thwacks
not
more
than
she
did
for
anything
else
coupeau
might
celebrate
saint
monday
for
weeks
altogether
go
off
on
the
spree
for
months
at
a
time
come
home
mad
with
liquor
and
seek
to
sharpen
her
as
he
said
she
had
grown
accustomed
to
it
she
thought
him
tiresome
but
nothing
more
it
was
on
these
occasions
that
she
wished
him
somewhere
else
yes
somewhere
her
beast
of
a
man
and
the
lorilleuxs
the
boches
and
the
poissons
too
in
fact
the
whole
neighborhood
which
she
had
such
contempt
for
she
sent
all
paris
there
with
a
gesture
of
supreme
carelessness
and
was
pleased
to
be
able
to
revenge
herself
in
this
style
one
could
get
used
to
almost
anything
but
still
it
is
hard
to
break
the
habit
of
eating
that
was
the
one
thing
that
really
annoyed
gervaise
the
hunger
that
kept
gnawing
at
her
insides
oh
those
pleasant
little
snacks
she
used
to
have
now
she
had
fallen
low
enough
to
gobble
anything
she
could
find
on
special
occasions
she
would
get
waste
scraps
of
meat
from
the
butcher
for
four
sous
a
pound
blacked
and
dried
out
meat
that
find
a
purchaser
she
would
mix
this
with
potatoes
for
a
stew
on
other
occasions
when
she
had
some
wine
she
treated
herself
to
a
sop
a
true
parrot
pottage
two
sous
worth
of
italian
cheese
bushels
of
white
potatoes
quarts
of
dry
beans
cooked
in
their
own
juice
these
also
were
dainties
she
was
not
often
able
to
indulge
in
now
she
came
down
to
leavings
from
low
eating
dens
where
for
a
sou
she
had
a
pile
of
mixed
with
the
parings
of
moldy
roast
meat
she
fell
even
lower
she
begged
a
charitable
keeper
to
give
her
his
customers
dry
crusts
and
she
made
herself
a
bread
soup
letting
the
crusts
simmer
as
long
as
possible
on
a
neighbor
fire
on
the
days
when
she
was
really
hungry
she
searched
about
with
the
dogs
to
see
what
might
be
lying
outside
the
tradespeople
doors
before
the
dustmen
went
by
and
thus
at
times
she
came
across
rich
men
food
rotten
melons
stinking
mackerel
and
chops
which
she
carefully
inspected
for
fear
of
maggots
yes
she
had
come
to
this
the
idea
may
be
a
repugnant
one
to
folks
but
if
they
had
chewed
anything
for
three
days
running
we
should
hardly
see
them
quarreling
with
their
stomachs
they
would
go
down
on
all
fours
and
eat
filth
like
other
people
ah
the
death
of
the
poor
the
empty
entrails
howling
hunger
the
animal
appetite
that
leads
one
with
chattering
teeth
to
fill
one
stomach
with
beastly
refuse
in
this
great
paris
so
bright
and
golden
and
to
think
that
gervaise
used
to
fill
her
belly
with
fat
goose
now
the
thought
of
it
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
one
day
when
coupeau
bagged
two
bread
tickets
from
her
to
go
and
sell
them
and
get
some
liquor
she
nearly
killed
him
with
the
blow
of
a
shovel
so
hungered
and
so
enraged
was
she
by
this
theft
of
a
bit
of
bread
however
after
a
long
contemplation
of
the
pale
sky
she
had
fallen
into
a
painful
doze
she
dreamt
that
the
sky
was
falling
on
her
so
cruelly
did
the
cold
pinch
suddenly
she
sprang
to
her
feet
awakened
with
a
start
by
a
shudder
of
anguish
dieu
was
she
going
to
die
shivering
and
haggard
she
perceived
that
it
was
still
daylight
the
night
ever
come
how
long
the
time
seems
when
the
stomach
is
empty
hers
was
waking
up
in
its
turn
and
beginning
to
torture
her
sinking
down
on
the
chair
with
her
head
bent
and
her
hands
between
her
legs
to
warm
them
she
began
to
think
what
they
would
have
for
dinner
as
soon
as
coupeau
brought
the
money
home
a
loaf
a
quart
of
wine
and
two
platefuls
of
tripe
in
the
lyonnaise
fashion
three
struck
by
father
bazouge
clock
yes
it
was
only
three
then
she
began
to
cry
she
would
never
have
strength
enough
to
wait
until
seven
her
body
swayed
backwards
and
forwards
she
oscillated
like
a
child
nursing
some
sharp
pain
bending
herself
double
and
crushing
her
stomach
so
as
not
to
feel
it
ah
an
accouchement
is
less
painful
than
hunger
and
unable
to
ease
herself
seized
with
rage
she
rose
and
stamped
about
hoping
to
send
her
hunger
to
sleep
by
walking
it
to
and
fro
like
an
infant
for
half
an
hour
or
so
she
knocked
against
the
four
corners
of
the
empty
room
then
suddenly
she
paused
with
a
fixed
stare
so
much
the
worse
they
might
say
what
they
liked
she
would
lick
their
feet
if
needs
be
but
she
would
go
and
ask
the
lorilleuxs
to
lend
her
ten
sous
at
winter
time
up
these
stairs
of
the
house
the
paupers
stairs
there
was
a
constant
borrowing
of
ten
sous
and
twenty
sous
petty
services
which
these
hungry
beggars
rendered
each
other
only
they
would
rather
have
died
than
have
applied
to
the
lorilleuxs
for
they
knew
they
were
too
thus
gervaise
displayed
remarkable
courage
in
going
to
knock
at
their
door
she
felt
so
frightened
in
the
passage
that
she
experienced
the
sudden
relief
of
people
who
ring
a
dentist
bell
come
in
cried
the
chainmaker
in
a
sour
voice
how
warm
and
nice
it
was
inside
the
forge
was
blazing
its
white
flame
lighting
up
the
narrow
workroom
whilst
madame
lorilleux
set
a
coil
of
gold
wire
to
heat
lorilleux
in
front
of
his
worktable
was
perspiring
with
the
warmth
as
he
soldered
the
links
of
a
chain
together
and
it
smelt
nice
some
cabbage
soup
was
simmering
on
the
stove
exhaling
a
steam
which
turned
gervaise
heart
and
almost
made
her
faint
ah
it
you
growled
madame
lorilleux
without
even
asking
her
to
sit
down
what
do
you
want
gervaise
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
she
had
recently
been
on
fairly
good
terms
with
the
lorilleuxs
but
she
saw
boche
sitting
by
the
stove
he
seemed
very
much
at
home
telling
funny
stories
what
do
you
want
repeated
lorilleux
you
have
seen
coupeau
gervaise
finally
stammered
at
last
i
thought
he
was
here
the
chainmakers
and
the
concierge
sneered
no
for
certain
they
seen
coupeau
they
did
stand
treat
often
enough
to
interest
coupeau
gervaise
made
an
effort
and
resumed
stuttering
it
because
he
promised
to
come
home
yes
he
to
bring
me
some
money
and
as
i
have
absolute
need
of
something
silence
followed
madame
lorilleux
was
roughly
fanning
the
fire
of
the
stove
lorilleux
had
lowered
his
nose
over
the
bit
of
chain
between
his
fingers
while
boche
continued
laughing
puffing
out
his
face
till
it
looked
like
the
full
moon
if
i
only
had
ten
sous
muttered
gervaise
in
a
low
voice
the
silence
persisted
could
you
lend
me
ten
sous
oh
i
would
return
them
to
you
this
evening
madame
lorilleux
turned
round
and
stared
at
her
here
was
a
wheedler
trying
to
get
round
them
she
asked
them
for
ten
sous
it
would
be
for
twenty
and
there
would
be
no
reason
to
stop
no
indeed
it
would
be
a
warm
day
in
winter
if
they
lent
her
anything
but
my
dear
cried
madame
lorilleux
you
know
very
well
that
we
have
any
money
look
there
the
lining
of
my
pocket
you
can
search
us
if
we
could
it
would
be
with
a
willing
heart
of
course
the
heart
always
there
growled
lorilleux
only
when
one
ca
one
ca
gervaise
looked
very
humble
and
nodded
her
head
approvingly
however
she
did
not
take
herself
off
she
squinted
at
the
gold
at
the
gold
tied
together
hanging
on
the
walls
at
the
gold
wire
the
wife
was
drawing
out
with
all
the
strength
of
her
little
arms
at
the
gold
links
lying
in
a
heap
under
the
husband
knotty
fingers
and
she
thought
that
the
least
bit
of
this
ugly
black
metal
would
suffice
to
buy
her
a
good
dinner
the
workroom
was
as
dirty
as
ever
full
of
old
iron
coal
dust
and
sticky
oil
stains
half
wiped
away
but
now
as
gervaise
saw
it
it
seemed
resplendent
with
treasure
like
a
money
changer
shop
and
so
she
ventured
to
repeat
softly
i
would
return
them
to
you
return
them
without
fail
ten
sous
would
inconvenience
you
her
heart
was
swelling
with
the
effort
she
made
not
to
own
that
she
had
had
nothing
to
eat
since
the
day
before
then
she
felt
her
legs
give
way
she
was
frightened
that
she
might
burst
into
tears
and
she
still
stammered
it
would
be
kind
of
you
you
do
know
yes
i
reduced
to
that
good
lord
reduced
to
that
thereupon
the
lorilleuxs
pursed
their
lips
and
exchanged
covert
glances
so
was
begging
now
well
the
fall
was
complete
but
they
did
not
care
for
that
kind
of
thing
by
any
means
if
they
had
known
they
would
have
barricaded
the
door
for
people
should
always
be
on
their
guard
against
beggars
folks
who
make
their
way
into
apartments
under
a
pretext
and
carry
precious
objects
away
with
them
and
especially
so
in
this
place
as
there
was
something
worth
while
stealing
one
might
lay
one
fingers
no
matter
where
and
carry
off
thirty
or
forty
francs
by
merely
closing
the
hands
they
had
felt
suspicious
several
times
already
on
noticing
how
strange
gervaise
looked
when
she
stuck
herself
in
front
of
the
gold
this
time
however
they
meant
to
watch
her
and
as
she
approached
nearer
with
her
feet
on
the
board
the
chainmaker
roughly
called
out
without
giving
any
further
answer
to
her
question
look
out
pest
take
care
you
be
carrying
some
scraps
of
gold
away
on
the
soles
of
your
shoes
one
would
think
you
had
greased
them
on
purpose
to
make
the
gold
stick
to
them
gervaise
slowly
drew
back
for
a
moment
she
leant
against
a
rack
and
seeing
that
madame
lorilleux
was
looking
at
her
hands
she
opened
them
and
showed
them
saying
softly
without
the
least
anger
like
a
fallen
women
who
accepts
anything
i
have
taken
nothing
you
can
look
and
then
she
went
off
because
the
strong
smell
of
the
cabbage
soup
and
the
warmth
of
the
workroom
made
her
feel
too
ah
the
lorilleuxs
did
not
detain
her
good
riddance
just
see
if
they
opened
the
door
to
her
again
they
had
seen
enough
of
her
face
they
did
want
other
people
misery
in
their
rooms
especially
when
that
misery
was
so
well
deserved
they
reveled
in
their
selfish
delight
at
being
seated
so
cozily
in
a
warm
room
with
a
dainty
soup
cooking
boche
also
stretched
himself
puffing
with
his
cheeks
still
more
and
more
so
much
indeed
that
his
laugh
really
became
indecent
they
were
all
nicely
revenged
on
for
her
former
manners
her
blue
shop
her
spreads
and
all
the
rest
it
had
all
worked
out
just
as
it
should
proving
where
a
love
of
would
get
you
so
that
is
the
style
now
begging
for
ten
sous
cried
madame
lorilleux
as
soon
as
gervaise
had
gone
wait
a
bit
i
lend
her
ten
sous
and
no
mistake
to
go
and
get
drunk
with
gervaise
shuffled
along
the
passage
in
her
slippers
bending
her
back
and
feeling
heavy
on
reaching
her
door
she
did
not
open
it
her
room
frightened
her
it
would
be
better
to
walk
about
she
would
learn
patience
as
she
passed
by
she
stretched
out
her
neck
peering
into
pere
bru
kennel
under
the
stairs
there
for
instance
was
another
one
who
must
have
a
fine
appetite
for
he
had
breakfasted
and
dined
by
heart
during
the
last
three
days
however
he
was
at
home
there
was
only
his
hole
and
gervaise
felt
somewhat
jealous
thinking
that
perhaps
he
had
been
invited
somewhere
then
as
she
reached
the
bijards
she
heard
lalie
moaning
and
as
the
key
was
in
the
lock
as
usual
she
opened
the
door
and
went
in
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
the
room
was
very
clean
one
could
see
that
lalie
had
carefully
swept
it
and
arranged
everything
during
the
morning
misery
might
blow
into
the
room
as
much
as
it
liked
carry
off
the
chattels
and
spread
all
the
dirt
and
refuse
about
lalie
however
came
behind
and
tidied
everything
imparting
at
least
some
appearance
of
comfort
within
she
might
not
be
rich
but
you
realized
that
there
was
a
housewife
in
the
place
that
afternoon
her
two
little
ones
henriette
and
jules
had
found
some
old
pictures
which
they
were
cutting
out
in
a
corner
but
gervaise
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
lalie
herself
in
bed
looking
very
pale
with
the
sheet
drawn
up
to
her
chin
in
bed
indeed
then
she
must
be
seriously
ill
what
is
the
matter
with
you
inquired
gervaise
feeling
anxious
lalie
no
longer
groaned
she
slowly
raised
her
white
eyelids
and
tried
to
compel
her
lips
to
smile
although
they
were
convulsed
by
a
shudder
there
nothing
the
matter
with
me
she
whispered
very
softly
really
nothing
at
all
then
closing
her
eyes
again
she
added
with
an
effort
i
made
myself
too
tired
during
the
last
few
days
and
so
i
doing
the
idle
i
nursing
myself
as
you
see
but
her
childish
face
streaked
with
livid
stains
assumed
such
an
expression
of
anguish
that
gervaise
forgetting
her
own
agony
joined
her
hands
and
fell
on
her
knees
near
the
bed
for
the
last
month
she
had
seen
the
girl
clinging
to
the
walls
for
support
when
she
went
about
bent
double
indeed
by
a
cough
which
seemed
to
presage
a
coffin
now
the
poor
child
could
not
even
cough
she
had
a
hiccough
and
drops
of
blood
oozed
from
the
corners
of
her
mouth
it
not
my
fault
if
i
hardly
feel
strong
she
murmured
as
if
relieved
i
tired
myself
trying
to
put
things
to
rights
it
pretty
tidy
is
it
and
i
wanted
to
clean
the
windows
as
well
but
my
legs
failed
me
how
stupid
however
when
one
has
finished
one
can
go
to
bed
she
paused
then
said
pray
see
if
my
little
ones
are
not
cutting
themselves
with
the
scissors
and
then
she
relapsed
into
silence
trembling
and
listening
to
a
heavy
footfall
which
was
approaching
up
the
stairs
suddenly
father
bijard
brutally
opened
the
door
as
usual
he
was
far
gone
and
his
eyes
shone
with
the
furious
madness
imparted
by
the
vitriol
he
had
swallowed
when
he
perceived
lalie
in
bed
he
tapped
on
his
thighs
with
a
sneer
and
took
the
whip
from
where
it
hung
ah
by
blazes
that
too
much
he
growled
we
soon
have
a
laugh
so
the
cows
lie
down
on
their
straw
at
noon
now
are
you
poking
fun
at
me
you
lazy
beggar
come
quick
now
up
you
get
and
he
cracked
the
whip
over
the
bed
but
the
child
beggingly
replied
pray
papa
do
do
strike
me
i
swear
to
you
you
will
regret
it
do
strike
will
you
jump
up
he
roared
still
louder
or
else
i
tickle
your
ribs
jump
up
you
little
hound
then
she
softly
said
i
ca
do
you
understand
i
going
to
die
gervaise
had
sprung
upon
bijard
and
torn
the
whip
away
from
him
he
stood
bewildered
in
front
of
the
bed
what
was
the
dirty
brat
talking
about
do
girls
die
so
young
without
even
having
been
ill
some
excuse
to
get
sugar
out
of
him
no
doubt
ah
he
make
inquiries
and
if
she
lied
let
her
look
out
you
will
see
it
the
truth
she
continued
as
long
as
i
could
i
avoided
worrying
you
but
be
kind
now
and
bid
me
papa
bijard
wriggled
his
nose
as
if
he
fancied
she
was
deceiving
him
and
yet
it
was
true
she
had
a
singular
look
the
serious
mien
of
a
grown
up
person
the
breath
of
death
which
passed
through
the
room
in
some
measure
sobered
him
he
gazed
around
like
a
man
awakened
from
a
long
sleep
saw
the
room
so
tidy
the
two
children
clean
playing
and
laughing
and
then
he
sank
on
to
a
chair
stammering
our
little
mother
our
little
mother
those
were
the
only
words
he
could
find
to
say
and
yet
they
were
very
tender
ones
to
lalie
who
had
never
been
much
spoiled
she
consoled
her
father
what
especially
worried
her
was
to
go
off
like
this
without
having
completely
brought
up
the
little
ones
he
would
take
care
of
them
would
he
not
with
her
dying
breath
she
told
him
how
they
ought
to
be
cared
for
and
kept
clean
but
stultified
with
the
fumes
of
drink
seizing
hold
of
him
again
he
wagged
his
head
watching
her
with
an
uncertain
stare
as
she
was
dying
all
kind
of
things
were
touched
in
him
but
he
could
find
no
more
to
say
and
he
was
too
utterly
burnt
with
liquor
to
shed
a
tear
listen
resumed
lalie
after
a
pause
we
owe
four
francs
and
seven
sous
to
the
baker
you
must
pay
that
madame
gaudron
borrowed
an
iron
of
ours
which
you
must
get
from
her
i
was
able
to
make
any
soup
this
evening
but
there
some
bread
left
and
you
can
warm
up
the
potatoes
till
her
last
rattle
the
poor
kitten
still
remained
the
little
mother
surely
she
could
never
be
replaced
she
was
dying
because
she
had
had
at
her
age
a
true
mother
reason
because
her
breast
was
too
small
and
weak
for
so
much
maternity
and
if
her
ferocious
beast
of
a
father
lost
his
treasure
it
was
his
own
fault
after
kicking
the
mother
to
death
had
he
murdered
the
daughter
as
well
the
two
good
angels
would
lie
in
the
pauper
grave
and
all
that
could
be
in
store
for
him
was
to
kick
the
bucket
like
a
dog
in
the
gutter
gervaise
restrained
herself
not
to
burst
out
sobbing
she
extended
her
hands
desirous
of
easing
the
child
and
as
the
shred
of
a
sheet
was
falling
she
wished
to
tack
it
up
and
arrange
the
bed
then
the
dying
girl
poor
little
body
was
seen
ah
dieu
what
misery
what
woe
stones
would
have
wept
lalie
was
bare
with
only
the
remnants
of
a
camisole
on
her
shoulders
by
way
of
chemise
yes
bare
with
the
grievous
bleeding
nudity
of
a
martyr
she
had
no
flesh
left
her
bones
seemed
to
protrude
through
the
skin
from
her
ribs
to
her
thighs
there
extended
a
number
of
violet
stripes
the
marks
of
the
whip
forcibly
imprinted
on
her
a
livid
bruise
moreover
encircled
her
left
arm
as
if
the
tender
limb
scarcely
larger
than
a
lucifer
had
been
crushed
in
a
vise
there
was
also
an
imperfectly
closed
wound
on
her
right
leg
left
there
by
some
ugly
blow
and
which
opened
again
and
again
of
a
morning
when
she
went
about
doing
her
errands
from
head
to
foot
indeed
she
was
but
one
bruise
oh
this
murdering
of
childhood
those
heavy
hands
crushing
this
lovely
girl
how
abominable
that
such
weakness
should
have
such
a
weighty
cross
to
bear
again
did
gervaise
crouch
down
no
longer
thinking
of
tucking
in
the
sheet
but
overwhelmed
by
the
pitiful
sight
of
this
martyrdom
and
her
trembling
lips
seemed
to
be
seeking
for
words
of
prayer
madame
coupeau
murmured
the
child
i
beg
you
with
her
little
arms
she
tried
to
draw
up
the
sheet
again
ashamed
as
it
were
for
her
father
bijard
as
stultified
as
ever
with
his
eyes
on
the
corpse
which
was
his
own
work
still
wagged
his
head
but
more
slowly
like
a
worried
animal
might
do
when
she
had
covered
lalie
up
again
gervaise
felt
she
could
not
remain
there
any
longer
the
dying
girl
was
growing
weaker
and
ceased
speaking
all
that
was
left
to
her
was
her
gaze
the
dark
look
she
had
had
as
a
resigned
and
thoughtful
child
and
which
she
now
fixed
on
her
two
little
ones
who
were
still
cutting
out
their
pictures
the
room
was
growing
gloomy
and
bijard
was
working
off
his
liquor
while
the
poor
girl
was
in
her
death
agonies
no
no
life
was
too
abominable
how
frightful
it
was
how
frightful
and
gervaise
took
herself
off
and
went
down
the
stairs
not
knowing
what
she
was
doing
her
head
wandering
and
so
full
of
disgust
that
she
would
willingly
have
thrown
herself
under
the
wheels
of
an
omnibus
to
have
finished
with
her
own
existence
as
she
hastened
on
growling
against
cursed
fate
she
suddenly
found
herself
in
front
of
the
place
where
coupeau
pretended
that
he
worked
her
legs
had
taken
her
there
and
now
her
stomach
began
singing
its
song
again
the
complaint
of
hunger
in
ninety
verses
a
complaint
she
knew
by
heart
however
if
she
caught
coupeau
as
he
left
she
would
be
able
to
pounce
upon
the
coin
at
once
and
buy
some
grub
a
short
hour
waiting
at
the
utmost
she
could
surely
stay
that
out
though
she
had
sucked
her
thumbs
since
the
day
before
she
was
at
the
corner
of
rue
de
la
charbonniere
and
rue
de
chartres
a
chill
wind
was
blowing
and
the
sky
was
an
ugly
leaden
grey
the
impending
snow
hung
over
the
city
but
not
a
flake
had
fallen
as
yet
she
tried
stamping
her
feet
to
keep
warm
but
soon
stopped
as
there
was
no
use
working
up
an
appetite
there
was
nothing
amusing
about
the
few
strode
rapidly
along
wrapped
up
in
comforters
naturally
enough
one
does
not
care
to
tarry
when
the
cold
is
nipping
at
your
heels
however
gervaise
perceived
four
or
five
women
who
were
mounting
guard
like
herself
outside
the
door
of
the
unfortunate
creatures
of
course
wives
watching
for
the
pay
to
prevent
it
going
to
the
there
was
a
tall
creature
as
bulky
as
a
gendarme
leaning
against
the
wall
ready
to
spring
on
her
husband
as
soon
as
he
showed
himself
a
dark
little
woman
with
a
delicate
humble
air
was
walking
about
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
another
one
a
fat
creature
had
brought
her
two
brats
with
her
and
was
dragging
them
along
one
on
either
hand
and
both
of
them
shivering
and
sobbing
and
all
these
women
gervaise
like
the
others
passed
and
repassed
exchanging
glances
but
without
speaking
to
one
another
a
pleasant
meeting
and
no
mistake
they
did
need
to
make
friends
to
learn
what
number
they
lived
at
they
could
all
hang
out
the
same
sideboard
misery
it
seemed
to
make
one
feel
even
colder
to
see
them
walk
about
in
silence
passing
each
other
in
this
terrible
january
weather
however
nobody
as
yet
left
the
but
presently
one
workman
appeared
then
two
and
then
three
but
these
were
no
doubt
decent
fellows
who
took
their
pay
home
regularly
for
they
jerked
their
heads
significantly
as
they
saw
the
shadows
wandering
up
and
down
the
tall
creature
stuck
closer
than
ever
to
the
side
of
the
door
and
suddenly
fell
upon
a
pale
little
man
who
was
prudently
poking
his
head
out
oh
it
was
soon
settled
she
searched
him
and
collared
his
coin
caught
no
more
money
not
even
enough
to
pay
for
a
dram
then
the
little
man
looking
very
vexed
and
cast
down
followed
his
gendarme
weeping
like
a
child
the
workmen
were
still
coming
out
and
as
the
fat
mother
with
the
two
brats
approached
the
door
a
tall
fellow
with
a
cunning
look
who
noticed
her
went
hastily
inside
again
to
warn
her
husband
and
when
the
latter
arrived
he
had
stuffed
a
couple
of
cart
wheels
away
two
beautiful
new
five
franc
pieces
one
in
each
of
his
shoes
he
took
one
of
the
brats
on
his
arm
and
went
off
telling
a
variety
of
lies
to
his
old
woman
who
was
complaining
there
were
other
workmen
also
fellows
who
carried
in
their
clinched
fists
the
pay
for
the
three
or
five
days
work
they
had
done
during
a
fortnight
who
reproached
themselves
with
their
own
laziness
and
took
oaths
but
the
saddest
thing
of
all
was
the
grief
of
the
dark
little
woman
with
the
humble
delicate
look
her
husband
a
handsome
fellow
took
himself
off
under
her
very
nose
and
so
brutally
indeed
that
he
almost
knocked
her
down
and
she
went
home
alone
stumbling
past
the
shops
and
weeping
all
the
tears
in
her
body
at
last
the
defile
finished
gervaise
who
stood
erect
in
the
middle
of
the
street
was
still
watching
the
door
the
seemed
a
bad
one
a
couple
of
workmen
who
were
late
appeared
on
the
threshold
but
there
were
still
no
signs
of
coupeau
and
when
she
asked
the
workmen
if
coupeau
was
coming
they
answered
her
being
up
to
snuff
that
he
had
gone
off
by
the
with
lantimeche
gervaise
understood
what
this
meant
another
of
coupeau
lies
she
could
whistle
for
him
if
she
liked
then
shuffling
along
in
her
shoes
she
went
slowly
down
the
rue
de
la
charbonniere
her
dinner
was
going
off
in
front
of
her
and
she
shuddered
as
she
saw
it
running
away
in
the
yellow
twilight
this
time
it
was
all
over
not
a
copper
not
a
hope
nothing
but
night
and
hunger
ah
a
fine
night
to
kick
the
bucket
this
dirty
night
which
was
falling
over
her
shoulders
she
was
walking
heavily
up
the
rue
des
poissonniers
when
she
suddenly
heard
coupeau
voice
yes
he
was
there
in
the
little
civet
letting
treat
him
that
comical
chap
had
been
cunning
enough
at
the
end
of
last
summer
to
espouse
in
authentic
fashion
a
lady
who
although
rather
advanced
in
years
had
still
preserved
considerable
traces
of
beauty
she
was
a
of
the
rue
des
martyrs
none
of
your
common
street
hussies
and
you
should
have
seen
this
fortunate
mortal
living
like
a
man
of
means
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
well
clad
and
well
fed
he
could
hardly
be
recognised
so
fat
had
he
grown
his
comrades
said
that
his
wife
had
as
much
work
as
she
liked
among
the
gentlemen
of
her
acquaintance
a
wife
like
that
and
a
is
all
one
can
wish
for
to
embellish
one
life
and
so
coupeau
squinted
admiringly
at
why
the
lucky
dog
even
had
a
gold
ring
on
his
little
finger
gervaise
touched
coupeau
on
the
shoulder
just
as
he
was
coming
out
of
the
little
civet
say
i
waiting
i
hungry
i
got
an
empty
stomach
which
is
all
i
ever
get
from
you
but
he
silenced
her
in
a
capital
style
you
hungry
eh
well
eat
your
fist
and
keep
the
other
for
he
considered
it
highly
improper
to
do
the
dramatic
in
other
presence
what
he
had
worked
and
yet
the
bakers
kneaded
bread
all
the
same
did
she
take
him
for
a
fool
to
come
and
try
to
frighten
him
with
her
stories
do
you
want
me
to
turn
thief
she
muttered
in
a
dull
voice
stroked
his
chin
in
conciliatory
fashion
no
forbidden
said
he
but
when
a
woman
knows
how
to
handle
herself
and
coupeau
interrupted
him
to
call
out
bravo
yes
a
woman
always
ought
to
know
how
to
handle
herself
but
his
wife
had
always
been
a
helpless
thing
it
would
be
her
fault
if
they
died
on
the
straw
then
he
relapsed
into
his
admiration
for
how
awfully
fine
he
looked
a
regular
landlord
with
clean
linen
and
swell
shoes
they
were
no
common
stuff
his
wife
at
all
events
knew
how
to
keep
the
pot
boiling
the
two
men
walked
towards
the
outer
boulevard
and
gervaise
followed
them
after
a
pause
she
resumed
talking
behind
coupeau
back
i
hungry
you
know
i
relied
on
you
you
must
find
me
something
to
nibble
he
did
not
answer
and
she
repeated
in
a
tone
of
despairing
agony
is
that
all
i
get
from
you
dieu
i
no
coin
he
roared
turning
round
in
a
fury
just
leave
me
alone
eh
or
else
i
hit
you
he
was
already
raising
his
fist
she
drew
back
and
seemed
to
make
up
her
mind
all
right
i
leave
you
i
guess
i
can
find
a
man
the
laughed
at
this
he
pretended
to
make
a
joke
of
the
matter
and
strengthened
her
purpose
without
seeming
to
do
so
that
was
a
fine
idea
of
hers
and
no
mistake
in
the
evening
by
gaslight
she
might
still
hook
a
man
he
recommended
her
to
try
the
capuchin
restaurant
where
one
could
dine
very
pleasantly
in
a
small
private
room
and
as
she
went
off
along
the
boulevard
looking
pale
and
furious
he
called
out
to
her
listen
bring
me
back
some
dessert
i
like
cakes
and
if
your
gentleman
is
well
dressed
ask
him
for
an
old
overcoat
i
could
use
one
with
these
words
ringing
in
her
ears
gervaise
walked
softly
away
but
when
she
found
herself
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
she
slackened
her
pace
she
was
quite
resolute
between
thieving
and
the
other
well
she
preferred
the
other
for
at
all
events
she
would
harm
any
one
no
doubt
it
was
proper
but
what
was
proper
and
what
was
improper
was
sorely
muddled
together
in
her
brain
when
you
are
dying
of
hunger
you
do
philosophize
you
eat
whatever
bread
turns
up
she
had
gone
along
as
far
as
the
it
seemed
as
if
the
night
would
never
come
however
she
followed
the
boulevards
like
a
lady
who
is
taking
a
stroll
before
dinner
the
neighborhood
in
which
she
felt
so
ashamed
so
greatly
was
it
being
embellished
was
now
full
of
fresh
air
lost
in
the
crowd
on
the
broad
footway
walking
past
the
little
plane
trees
gervaise
felt
alone
and
abandoned
the
vistas
of
the
avenues
seemed
to
empty
her
stomach
all
the
more
and
to
think
that
among
this
flood
of
people
there
were
many
in
easy
circumstances
and
yet
not
a
christian
who
could
guess
her
position
and
slip
a
ten
sous
piece
into
her
hand
yes
it
was
too
great
and
too
beautiful
her
head
swam
and
her
legs
tottered
under
this
broad
expanse
of
grey
sky
stretched
over
so
vast
a
space
the
twilight
had
the
tinge
of
parisian
evenings
a
tint
that
gives
you
a
longing
to
die
at
once
so
ugly
does
street
life
seem
the
horizon
was
growing
indistinct
assuming
a
tinge
as
it
were
gervaise
who
was
already
weary
met
all
the
workpeople
returning
home
at
this
hour
of
the
day
the
ladies
in
bonnets
and
the
gentlemen
living
in
the
new
houses
mingled
with
the
people
with
the
files
of
men
and
women
still
pale
from
inhaling
the
tainted
atmosphere
of
workshops
and
workrooms
from
the
boulevard
magenta
and
the
rue
du
came
bands
of
people
rendered
breathless
by
their
uphill
walk
as
the
omnivans
and
the
cabs
rolled
by
less
noiselessly
among
the
vans
and
trucks
returning
home
empty
at
a
gallop
an
swarm
of
blouses
and
blue
vests
covered
the
pavement
commissionaires
returned
with
their
crotchets
on
their
backs
two
workmen
took
long
strides
side
by
side
talking
to
each
other
in
loud
voices
with
any
amount
of
gesticulation
but
without
looking
at
one
another
others
who
were
alone
in
overcoats
and
caps
walked
along
the
curbstones
with
lowered
noses
others
again
came
in
parties
of
five
or
six
following
each
other
with
pale
eyes
and
their
hands
in
their
pockets
and
not
exchanging
a
word
some
still
had
their
pipes
which
had
gone
out
between
their
teeth
four
masons
poked
their
white
faces
out
of
the
windows
of
a
cab
which
they
had
hired
between
them
and
on
the
roof
of
which
their
rocked
to
and
fro
were
swinging
their
pots
a
was
returning
laden
with
a
long
ladder
with
which
he
almost
poked
eyes
out
whilst
a
belated
plumber
with
his
box
on
his
back
played
the
tune
of
the
good
king
dagobert
on
his
little
trumpet
ah
the
sad
music
a
fitting
accompaniment
to
the
tread
of
the
flock
the
tread
of
the
weary
beasts
of
burden
suddenly
on
raising
her
eyes
she
noticed
the
old
hotel
boncoeur
in
front
of
her
after
being
an
cafe
which
the
police
had
closed
down
the
little
house
was
now
abandoned
the
shutters
were
covered
with
posters
the
lantern
was
broken
and
the
whole
building
was
rotting
and
crumbling
away
from
top
to
bottom
with
its
smudgy
paint
quite
moldy
the
stationer
and
the
tobacconist
were
still
there
in
the
rear
over
some
low
buildings
you
could
see
the
leprous
facades
of
several
houses
rearing
their
outlines
against
the
sky
the
grand
balcony
dancing
hall
no
longer
existed
some
works
which
hissed
continually
had
been
installed
in
the
hall
with
the
ten
flaming
windows
and
yet
it
was
here
in
this
dirty
den
the
hotel
boncoeur
that
the
whole
cursed
life
had
commenced
gervaise
remained
looking
at
the
window
of
the
first
floor
from
which
hung
a
broken
shutter
and
recalled
to
mind
her
youth
with
lantier
their
first
rows
and
the
ignoble
way
in
which
he
had
abandoned
her
never
mind
she
was
young
then
and
it
all
seemed
gay
to
her
seen
from
a
distance
only
twenty
years
dieu
and
yet
she
had
fallen
to
then
the
sight
of
the
lodging
house
oppressed
her
and
she
walked
up
the
boulevard
in
the
direction
of
montmartre
the
night
was
gathering
but
children
were
still
playing
on
the
heaps
of
sand
between
the
benches
the
march
past
continued
the
workgirls
went
by
trotting
along
and
hurrying
to
make
up
for
the
time
they
had
lost
in
looking
in
at
the
shop
windows
one
tall
girl
who
had
stopped
left
her
hand
in
that
of
a
big
fellow
who
accompanied
her
to
within
three
doors
of
her
home
others
as
they
parted
from
each
other
made
appointments
for
the
night
at
the
great
hall
of
folly
or
the
black
ball
in
the
midst
of
the
groups
went
by
carrying
their
clothes
folded
under
their
arms
a
chimney
sweep
harnessed
with
leather
braces
was
drawing
a
cart
along
and
nearly
got
himself
crushed
by
an
omnibus
among
the
crowd
which
was
now
growing
scantier
there
were
several
women
running
with
bare
heads
after
lighting
the
fire
they
had
come
downstairs
again
and
were
hastily
making
their
purchases
for
dinner
they
jostled
the
people
they
met
darted
into
the
bakers
and
the
pork
butchers
and
went
off
again
with
all
despatch
their
provisions
in
their
hands
there
were
little
girls
of
eight
years
old
who
had
been
sent
out
on
errands
and
who
went
along
past
the
shops
pressing
long
loaves
of
four
pounds
weight
as
tall
as
they
were
themselves
against
their
chests
as
if
these
loaves
had
been
beautiful
yellow
dolls
at
times
these
little
ones
forgot
themselves
for
five
minutes
or
so
in
front
of
some
pictures
in
a
shop
window
and
rested
their
cheeks
against
the
bread
then
the
flow
subsided
the
groups
became
fewer
and
farther
between
the
working
classes
had
gone
home
and
as
the
gas
blazed
now
that
the
day
toil
was
over
idleness
and
amusement
seemed
to
wake
up
ah
yes
gervaise
had
finished
her
day
she
was
wearier
even
than
all
this
mob
of
toilers
who
had
jostled
her
as
they
went
by
she
might
lie
down
there
and
croak
for
work
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
her
and
she
had
toiled
enough
during
her
life
to
say
whose
turn
now
had
enough
at
present
everyone
was
eating
it
was
really
the
end
the
sun
had
blown
out
its
candle
the
night
would
be
a
long
one
dieu
to
stretch
one
self
at
one
ease
and
never
get
up
again
to
think
one
had
put
one
tools
by
for
good
and
that
one
could
ruminate
like
a
cow
forever
that
what
is
good
after
tiring
one
self
out
for
twenty
years
and
gervaise
as
hunger
twisted
her
stomach
thought
in
spite
of
herself
of
the
fete
days
the
spreads
and
the
revelry
of
her
life
of
one
occasion
especially
an
awfully
cold
day
a
thursday
she
had
enjoyed
herself
wonderfully
well
she
was
very
pretty
and
fresh
looking
at
that
time
her
in
the
rue
neuve
had
chosen
her
as
queen
in
spite
of
her
leg
and
then
they
had
had
an
outing
on
the
boulevards
in
carts
decked
with
greenery
in
the
midst
of
stylish
people
who
ogled
her
real
gentlemen
put
up
their
glasses
as
if
she
had
been
a
true
queen
in
the
evening
there
was
a
wonderful
spread
and
then
they
had
danced
till
daylight
queen
yes
queen
with
a
crown
and
a
sash
for
hours
twice
round
the
clock
and
now
oppressed
by
hunger
she
looked
on
the
ground
as
if
she
were
seeking
for
the
gutter
in
which
she
had
let
her
fallen
majesty
tumble
she
raised
her
eyes
again
she
was
in
front
of
the
which
were
being
pulled
down
through
the
gaps
in
the
facade
one
could
see
the
dark
stinking
courtyards
still
damp
with
blood
and
when
she
had
gone
down
the
boulevard
again
she
also
saw
the
lariboisiere
hospital
with
its
long
grey
wall
above
which
she
could
distinguish
the
mournful
wings
pierced
with
windows
at
even
distances
a
door
in
the
wall
filled
the
neighborhood
with
dread
it
was
the
door
of
the
dead
in
solid
oak
and
without
a
crack
as
stern
and
as
silent
as
a
tombstone
then
to
escape
her
thoughts
she
hurried
further
down
till
she
reached
the
railway
bridge
the
high
parapets
of
riveted
hid
the
line
from
view
she
could
only
distinguish
a
corner
of
the
station
standing
out
against
the
luminous
horizon
of
paris
with
a
vast
roof
black
with
through
the
clear
space
she
could
hear
the
engines
whistling
and
the
cars
being
shunted
in
token
of
colossal
hidden
activity
then
a
train
passed
by
leaving
paris
with
puffing
breath
and
a
growing
rumble
and
all
she
perceived
of
this
train
was
a
white
plume
a
sudden
gust
of
steam
which
rose
above
the
parapet
and
then
evaporated
but
the
bridge
had
shaken
and
she
herself
seemed
impressed
by
this
departure
at
full
speed
she
turned
round
as
if
to
follow
the
invisible
engine
the
noise
of
which
was
dying
away
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
open
country
through
a
gap
between
tall
buildings
oh
if
only
she
could
have
taken
a
train
and
gone
away
far
away
from
this
poverty
and
suffering
she
might
have
started
an
entirely
new
life
then
she
turned
to
look
at
the
posters
on
the
bridge
sidings
one
was
on
pretty
blue
paper
and
offered
a
reward
for
a
lost
dog
someone
must
have
really
loved
that
dog
gervaise
slowly
resumed
her
walk
in
the
smoky
fog
which
was
falling
the
gas
lamps
were
being
lighted
up
and
the
long
avenues
which
had
grown
bleak
and
indistinct
suddenly
showed
themselves
plainly
again
sparkling
to
their
full
length
and
piercing
through
the
night
even
to
the
vague
darkness
of
the
horizon
a
great
gust
swept
by
the
widened
spaces
were
lighted
up
with
girdles
of
little
flames
shining
under
the
moonless
sky
it
was
the
hour
when
from
one
end
of
the
boulevard
to
the
other
the
and
the
flamed
gayly
as
the
first
glasses
were
merrily
drunk
and
the
first
dance
began
it
was
the
great
fortnightly
and
the
pavement
was
crowded
with
jostling
revelers
on
the
spree
there
was
a
breath
of
merrymaking
in
the
air
deuced
fine
revelry
but
not
objectionable
so
far
fellows
were
filling
themselves
in
the
through
the
lighted
windows
you
could
see
people
feeding
with
their
mouths
full
and
laughing
without
taking
the
trouble
to
swallow
first
drunkards
were
already
installed
in
the
wineshops
squabbling
and
gesticulating
and
there
was
a
cursed
noise
on
all
sides
voices
shouting
amid
the
constant
clatter
of
feet
on
the
pavement
say
are
you
coming
to
sip
make
haste
old
man
i
pay
for
a
glass
of
bottled
wine
here
pauline
sha
we
just
laugh
the
doors
swung
to
and
fro
letting
a
smell
of
wine
and
a
sound
of
cornet
playing
escape
into
the
open
air
there
was
a
gathering
in
front
of
pere
colombe
which
was
lighted
up
like
a
cathedral
for
high
mass
dieu
you
would
have
said
a
real
ceremony
was
going
on
for
several
capital
fellows
with
rounded
paunches
and
swollen
cheeks
looking
for
all
the
world
like
professional
choristers
were
singing
inside
they
were
celebrating
of
course
a
very
amiable
saint
who
no
doubt
keeps
the
cash
box
in
paradise
only
on
seeing
how
gaily
the
evening
began
the
retired
petty
tradesmen
who
had
taken
their
wives
out
for
a
stroll
wagged
their
heads
and
repeated
that
there
would
be
any
number
of
drunken
men
in
paris
that
night
and
the
night
stretched
very
dark
and
icy
above
this
revelry
perforated
only
with
lines
of
gas
lamps
extending
to
the
four
corners
of
heaven
gervaise
stood
in
front
of
thinking
that
if
she
had
had
a
couple
of
sous
she
could
have
gone
inside
and
drunk
a
dram
no
doubt
a
dram
would
have
quieted
her
hunger
ah
what
a
number
of
drams
she
had
drunk
in
her
time
liquor
seemed
good
stuff
to
her
after
all
and
from
outside
she
watched
the
machine
realizing
that
her
misfortune
was
due
to
it
and
yet
dreaming
of
finishing
herself
off
with
brandy
on
the
day
she
had
some
coin
but
a
shudder
passed
through
her
hair
as
she
saw
it
was
now
almost
dark
well
the
night
time
was
approaching
she
must
have
some
pluck
and
sell
herself
coaxingly
if
she
did
wish
to
kick
the
bucket
in
the
midst
of
the
general
revelry
looking
at
other
people
gorging
themselves
did
precisely
fill
her
own
stomach
she
slackened
her
pace
again
and
looked
around
her
there
was
a
darker
shade
under
the
trees
few
people
passed
along
only
folks
in
a
hurry
who
swiftly
crossed
the
boulevards
and
on
the
broad
dark
deserted
footway
where
the
sound
of
the
revelry
died
away
women
were
standing
and
waiting
they
remained
for
long
intervals
motionless
patient
and
as
as
the
scrubby
little
plane
trees
then
they
slowly
began
to
move
dragging
their
slippers
over
the
frozen
soil
taking
ten
steps
or
so
and
then
waiting
again
rooted
as
it
were
to
the
ground
there
was
one
of
them
with
a
huge
body
and
arms
and
legs
wearing
a
black
silk
rag
with
a
yellow
scarf
over
her
head
there
was
another
one
tall
and
bony
who
was
bareheaded
and
wore
a
apron
and
others
too
old
ones
plastered
up
and
young
ones
so
dirty
that
a
ragpicker
would
not
have
picked
them
up
however
gervaise
tried
to
learn
what
to
do
by
imitating
them
emotion
tightened
her
throat
she
was
hardly
aware
whether
she
felt
ashamed
or
not
she
seemed
to
be
living
in
a
horrible
dream
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
remained
standing
erect
men
hurried
by
without
even
turning
their
heads
then
she
moved
about
in
her
turn
and
venturing
to
accost
a
man
who
was
whistling
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
she
murmured
in
a
strangled
voice
sir
listen
a
moment
the
man
gave
her
a
side
glance
and
then
went
off
whistling
all
the
louder
gervaise
grew
bolder
and
with
her
stomach
empty
she
became
absorbed
in
this
chase
fiercely
rushing
after
her
dinner
which
was
still
running
away
she
walked
about
for
a
long
while
without
thinking
of
the
flight
of
time
or
of
the
direction
she
took
around
her
the
dark
mute
women
went
to
and
fro
under
the
trees
like
wild
beasts
in
a
cage
they
stepped
out
of
the
shade
like
apparitions
and
passed
under
the
light
of
a
gas
lamp
with
their
pale
masks
fully
apparent
then
they
grew
vague
again
as
they
went
off
into
the
darkness
with
a
white
strip
of
petticoat
swinging
to
and
fro
men
let
themselves
be
stopped
at
times
talked
jokingly
and
then
started
off
again
laughing
others
would
quietly
follow
a
woman
to
her
room
discreetly
ten
paces
behind
there
was
a
deal
of
muttering
quarreling
in
an
undertone
and
furious
bargaining
which
suddenly
subsided
into
profound
silence
and
as
far
as
gervaise
went
she
saw
these
women
standing
like
sentinels
in
the
night
they
seemed
to
be
placed
along
the
whole
length
of
the
boulevard
as
soon
as
she
met
one
she
saw
another
twenty
paces
further
on
and
the
file
stretched
out
unceasingly
entire
paris
was
guarded
she
grew
enraged
on
finding
herself
disdained
and
changing
her
place
she
now
perambulated
between
the
chaussee
de
clignancourt
and
the
grand
rue
of
la
chapelle
all
were
beggars
sir
just
listen
but
the
men
passed
by
she
started
from
the
which
stank
of
blood
she
glanced
on
her
way
at
the
old
hotel
boncoeur
now
closed
she
passed
in
front
of
the
lariboisiere
hospital
and
mechanically
counted
the
number
of
windows
that
were
illuminated
with
a
pale
quiet
glimmer
like
that
of
at
the
bedside
of
some
agonizing
sufferers
she
crossed
the
railway
bridge
as
the
trains
rushed
by
with
a
noisy
rumble
rending
the
air
in
twain
with
their
shrill
whistling
ah
how
sad
everything
seemed
at
then
she
turned
on
her
heels
again
and
filled
her
eyes
with
the
sight
of
the
same
houses
doing
this
ten
and
twenty
times
without
pausing
without
resting
for
a
minute
on
a
bench
no
no
one
wanted
her
her
shame
seemed
to
be
increased
by
this
contempt
she
went
down
towards
the
hospital
again
and
then
returned
towards
the
it
was
her
last
promenade
from
the
courtyards
where
animals
were
slaughtered
down
to
the
pale
hospital
wards
where
death
stiffened
the
patients
stretched
between
the
sheets
it
was
between
these
two
establishments
that
she
had
passed
her
life
sir
just
listen
but
suddenly
she
perceived
her
shadow
on
the
ground
when
she
approached
a
it
gradually
became
less
vague
till
it
stood
out
at
last
in
full
force
an
enormous
shadow
it
was
positively
grotesque
so
portly
had
she
become
her
stomach
breast
and
hips
all
equally
flabby
jostled
together
as
it
were
she
walked
with
such
a
limp
that
the
shadow
bobbed
almost
at
every
step
she
took
it
looked
like
a
real
punch
then
as
she
left
the
street
lamp
behind
her
the
punch
grew
taller
becoming
in
fact
gigantic
filling
the
whole
boulevard
bobbing
to
and
fro
in
such
style
that
it
seemed
fated
to
smash
its
nose
against
the
trees
or
the
houses
dieu
how
frightful
she
was
she
had
never
realised
her
disfigurement
so
thoroughly
and
she
could
not
help
looking
at
her
shadow
indeed
she
waited
for
the
still
watching
the
punch
as
it
bobbed
about
ah
she
had
a
pretty
companion
beside
her
what
a
figure
it
ought
to
attract
the
men
at
once
and
at
the
thought
of
her
unsightliness
she
lowered
her
voice
and
only
just
dared
to
stammer
behind
the
sir
just
listen
it
was
now
getting
quite
late
matters
were
growing
bad
in
the
neighborhood
the
had
closed
and
voices
gruff
with
drink
could
be
heard
disputing
in
the
wineshops
revelry
was
turning
to
quarreling
and
fisticuffs
a
big
ragged
chap
roared
out
i
knock
yer
to
bits
just
count
yer
bones
a
large
woman
had
quarreled
with
a
fellow
outside
a
dancing
place
and
was
calling
him
dirty
blackguard
and
lousy
bum
whilst
he
on
his
side
just
muttered
under
his
breath
drink
seemed
to
have
imparted
a
fierce
desire
to
indulge
in
blows
and
the
who
were
now
less
numerous
had
pale
contracted
faces
there
was
a
battle
at
last
one
drunken
fellow
came
down
on
his
back
with
all
four
limbs
raised
in
the
air
whilst
his
comrade
thinking
he
had
done
for
him
ran
off
with
his
heavy
shoes
clattering
over
the
pavement
groups
of
men
sang
dirty
songs
and
then
there
would
be
long
silences
broken
only
by
hiccoughs
or
the
thud
of
a
drunk
falling
down
gervaise
still
hobbled
about
going
up
and
down
with
the
idea
of
walking
forever
at
times
she
felt
drowsy
and
almost
went
to
sleep
rocked
as
it
were
by
her
lame
leg
then
she
looked
round
her
with
a
start
and
noticed
she
had
walked
a
hundred
yards
unconsciously
her
feet
were
swelling
in
her
ragged
shoes
the
last
clear
thought
that
occupied
her
mind
was
that
her
hussy
of
a
daughter
was
perhaps
eating
oysters
at
that
very
moment
then
everything
became
cloudy
and
albeit
she
remained
with
open
eyes
it
required
too
great
an
effort
for
her
to
think
the
only
sensation
that
remained
to
her
in
her
utter
annihilation
was
that
it
was
frightfully
cold
so
sharply
mortally
cold
she
had
never
known
the
like
before
why
even
dead
people
could
not
feel
so
cold
in
their
graves
with
an
effort
she
raised
her
head
and
something
seemed
to
lash
her
face
it
was
the
snow
which
had
at
last
decided
to
fall
from
the
smoky
sky
fine
thick
snow
which
the
breeze
swept
round
and
round
for
three
days
it
had
been
expected
and
what
a
splendid
moment
it
chose
to
appear
woken
up
by
the
first
gusts
gervaise
began
to
walk
faster
eager
to
get
home
men
were
running
along
with
their
shoulders
already
white
and
as
she
suddenly
saw
one
who
on
the
contrary
was
coming
slowly
towards
her
under
the
trees
she
approached
him
and
again
said
sir
just
listen
the
man
has
stopped
but
he
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
her
he
held
out
his
hand
and
muttered
in
a
low
voice
charity
if
you
please
they
looked
at
one
another
ah
dieu
they
were
reduced
to
this
pere
bru
begging
madame
coupeau
walking
the
streets
they
remained
stupefied
in
front
of
each
other
they
could
join
hands
as
equals
now
the
old
workman
had
prowled
about
the
whole
evening
not
daring
to
stop
anyone
and
the
first
person
he
accosted
was
as
hungry
as
himself
lord
was
it
not
pitiful
to
have
toiled
for
fifty
years
and
be
obliged
to
beg
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
prosperous
laundresses
in
the
rue
de
la
and
to
end
beside
the
gutter
they
still
looked
at
one
another
then
without
saying
a
word
they
went
off
in
different
directions
under
the
lashing
snow
it
was
a
perfect
tempest
on
these
heights
in
the
midst
of
this
open
space
the
fine
snow
revolved
round
and
round
as
if
the
wind
came
from
the
four
corners
of
heaven
you
could
not
see
ten
paces
off
everything
was
confused
in
the
midst
of
this
flying
dust
the
surroundings
had
disappeared
the
boulevard
seemed
to
be
dead
as
if
the
storm
had
stretched
the
silence
of
its
white
sheet
over
the
hiccoughs
of
the
last
drunkards
gervaise
still
went
on
blinded
lost
she
felt
her
way
by
touching
the
trees
as
she
advanced
the
shone
out
amidst
the
whiteness
like
torches
then
suddenly
whenever
she
crossed
an
open
space
these
lights
failed
her
she
was
enveloped
in
the
whirling
snow
unable
to
distinguish
anything
to
guide
her
below
stretched
the
ground
vaguely
white
grey
walls
surrounded
her
and
when
she
paused
hesitating
and
turning
her
head
she
divined
that
behind
this
icy
veil
extended
the
immense
avenue
with
interminable
vistas
of
the
black
and
deserted
infinite
of
paris
asleep
she
was
standing
where
the
outer
boulevard
meets
the
boulevards
magenta
and
ornano
thinking
of
lying
down
on
the
ground
when
suddenly
she
heard
a
footfall
she
began
to
run
but
the
snow
blinded
her
and
the
footsteps
went
off
without
her
being
able
to
tell
whether
it
was
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
at
last
however
she
perceived
a
man
broad
shoulders
a
dark
form
which
was
disappearing
amid
the
snow
oh
she
would
let
this
man
get
away
and
she
ran
on
all
the
faster
reached
him
and
caught
him
by
the
blouse
sir
sir
just
listen
the
man
turned
round
it
was
goujet
so
now
she
had
accosted
but
what
had
she
done
on
earth
to
be
tortured
like
this
by
providence
it
was
the
crowning
blow
to
stumble
against
goujet
and
be
seen
by
her
blacksmith
friend
pale
and
begging
like
a
common
street
walker
and
it
happened
just
under
a
she
could
see
her
deformed
shadow
swaying
on
the
snow
like
a
real
caricature
you
would
have
said
she
was
drunk
dieu
not
to
have
a
crust
of
bread
or
a
drop
of
wine
in
her
body
and
to
be
taken
for
a
drunken
women
it
was
her
own
fault
why
did
she
booze
goujet
no
doubt
thought
she
had
been
drinking
and
that
she
was
up
to
some
nasty
pranks
he
looked
at
her
while
the
snow
scattered
daisies
over
his
beautiful
yellow
beard
then
as
she
lowered
her
head
and
stepped
back
he
detained
her
come
said
he
and
he
walked
on
first
she
followed
him
they
both
crossed
the
silent
district
gliding
noiselessly
along
the
walls
poor
madame
goujet
had
died
of
rheumatism
in
the
month
of
october
goujet
still
resided
in
the
little
house
in
the
rue
neuve
living
gloomily
alone
on
this
occasion
he
was
belated
because
he
had
sat
up
nursing
a
wounded
comrade
when
he
had
opened
the
door
and
lighted
a
lamp
he
turned
towards
gervaise
who
had
remained
humbly
on
the
threshold
then
in
a
low
voice
as
if
he
were
afraid
his
mother
could
still
hear
him
he
exclaimed
come
in
the
first
room
madame
goujet
was
piously
preserved
in
the
state
she
had
left
it
on
a
chair
near
the
window
lay
the
tambour
by
the
side
of
the
large
which
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
the
old
the
bed
was
made
and
she
could
have
stretched
herself
beneath
the
sheets
if
she
had
left
the
cemetery
to
come
and
spend
the
evening
with
her
child
there
was
something
solemn
a
perfume
of
honesty
and
goodness
about
the
room
come
in
repeated
the
blacksmith
in
a
louder
tone
she
went
in
half
frightened
like
a
disreputable
woman
gliding
into
a
respectable
place
he
was
quite
pale
and
trembled
at
the
thought
of
ushering
a
woman
like
this
into
his
dead
mother
home
they
crossed
the
room
on
as
if
they
were
ashamed
to
be
heard
then
when
he
had
pushed
gervaise
into
his
own
room
he
closed
the
door
here
he
was
at
home
it
was
the
narrow
closet
she
was
acquainted
with
a
room
with
the
little
iron
bedstead
hung
with
white
curtains
on
the
walls
the
engravings
cut
out
of
illustrated
newspapers
had
gathered
and
spread
and
they
now
reached
to
the
ceiling
the
room
looked
so
pure
that
gervaise
did
not
dare
to
advance
but
retreated
as
far
as
she
could
from
the
lamp
then
without
a
word
in
a
transport
as
it
were
he
tried
to
seize
hold
of
her
and
press
her
in
his
arms
but
she
felt
faint
and
murmured
oh
dieu
oh
dieu
the
fire
in
the
stove
having
been
covered
with
was
still
alight
and
the
remains
of
a
stew
which
goujet
had
put
to
warm
thinking
he
should
return
to
dinner
was
smoking
in
front
of
the
cinders
gervaise
who
felt
her
numbness
leave
her
in
the
warmth
of
this
room
would
have
gone
down
on
all
fours
to
eat
out
of
the
saucepan
her
hunger
was
stronger
than
her
will
her
stomach
seemed
rent
in
two
and
she
stooped
down
with
a
sigh
goujet
had
realized
the
truth
he
placed
the
stew
on
the
table
cut
some
bread
and
poured
her
out
a
glass
of
wine
thank
you
thank
you
said
she
oh
how
kind
you
are
thank
you
she
stammered
she
could
hardly
articulate
when
she
caught
hold
of
her
fork
she
began
to
tremble
so
acutely
that
she
let
it
fall
again
the
hunger
that
possessed
her
made
her
wag
her
head
as
if
senile
she
carried
the
food
to
her
mouth
with
her
fingers
as
she
stuffed
the
first
potato
into
her
mouth
she
burst
out
sobbing
big
tears
coursed
down
her
cheeks
and
fell
onto
her
bread
she
still
ate
gluttonously
devouring
this
bread
thus
moistened
by
her
tears
and
breathing
very
hard
all
the
while
goujet
compelled
her
to
drink
to
prevent
her
from
stifling
and
her
glass
chinked
as
it
were
against
her
teeth
will
you
have
some
more
bread
he
asked
in
an
undertone
she
cried
she
said
no
she
said
yes
she
did
know
ah
how
nice
and
yet
how
painful
it
is
to
eat
when
one
is
starving
and
standing
in
front
of
her
goujet
looked
at
her
all
the
while
under
the
bright
light
cast
by
the
he
could
see
her
well
how
aged
and
altered
she
seemed
the
heat
was
melting
the
snow
on
her
hair
and
clothes
and
she
was
dripping
her
poor
wagging
head
was
quite
grey
there
were
any
number
of
grey
locks
which
the
wind
had
disarranged
her
neck
sank
into
her
shoulders
and
she
had
become
so
fat
and
ugly
you
might
have
cried
on
noticing
the
change
he
recollected
their
love
when
she
was
quite
rosy
working
with
her
irons
and
showing
the
crease
which
set
such
a
charming
necklace
round
her
throat
in
those
times
he
had
watched
her
for
hours
glad
just
to
look
at
her
later
on
she
had
come
to
the
forge
and
there
they
had
enjoyed
themselves
whilst
he
beat
the
iron
and
she
stood
by
watching
his
hammer
dance
how
often
at
night
with
his
head
buried
in
his
pillow
had
he
dreamed
of
holding
her
in
his
arms
gervaise
rose
she
had
finished
she
remained
for
a
moment
with
her
head
lowered
and
ill
at
ease
then
thinking
she
detected
a
gleam
in
his
eyes
she
raised
her
hand
to
her
jacket
and
began
to
unfasten
the
first
button
but
goujet
had
fallen
on
his
knees
and
taking
hold
of
her
hands
he
exclaimed
softly
i
love
you
madame
gervaise
oh
i
love
you
still
and
in
spite
of
everything
i
swear
it
to
you
do
say
that
monsieur
goujet
she
cried
maddened
to
see
him
like
this
at
her
feet
no
do
say
that
you
grieve
me
too
much
and
as
he
repeated
that
he
could
never
love
twice
in
his
life
she
became
yet
more
despairing
no
no
i
am
too
ashamed
for
the
love
of
god
get
up
it
is
my
place
to
be
on
the
ground
he
rose
he
trembled
all
over
and
stammered
will
you
allow
me
to
kiss
you
overcome
with
surprise
and
emotion
she
could
not
speak
but
she
assented
with
a
nod
of
the
head
after
all
she
was
his
he
could
do
what
he
chose
with
her
but
he
merely
kissed
her
that
suffices
between
us
madame
gervaise
he
muttered
it
sums
up
all
our
friendship
does
it
not
he
had
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
on
a
lock
of
her
grey
hair
he
had
not
kissed
anyone
since
his
mother
death
his
sweetheart
gervaise
alone
remained
to
him
in
life
and
then
when
he
had
kissed
her
with
so
much
respect
he
fell
back
across
his
bed
with
sobs
rising
in
his
throat
and
gervaise
could
not
remain
there
any
longer
it
was
too
sad
and
too
abominable
to
meet
again
under
such
circumstances
when
one
loved
i
love
you
monsieur
goujet
she
exclaimed
i
love
you
dearly
also
oh
it
is
possible
you
still
love
me
it
would
smother
us
both
it
would
be
more
than
we
could
stand
and
she
darted
through
madame
goujet
room
and
found
herself
outside
on
the
pavement
again
when
she
recovered
her
senses
she
had
rung
at
the
door
in
the
rue
de
la
and
boche
was
pulling
the
string
the
house
was
quite
dark
and
in
the
black
night
the
yawning
dilapidated
porch
looked
like
an
open
mouth
to
think
that
she
had
been
ambitious
of
having
a
corner
in
this
barracks
had
her
ears
been
stopped
up
then
that
she
had
not
heard
the
cursed
music
of
despair
which
sounded
behind
the
walls
since
she
had
set
foot
in
the
place
she
had
begun
to
go
down
hill
yes
it
must
bring
bad
luck
to
shut
oneself
up
in
these
big
workmen
houses
the
cholera
of
misery
was
contagious
there
that
night
everyone
seemed
to
have
kicked
the
bucket
she
only
heard
the
boches
snoring
on
the
side
while
lantier
and
virginie
on
the
left
were
purring
like
a
couple
of
cats
who
were
not
asleep
but
have
their
eyes
closed
and
feel
warm
in
the
courtyard
she
fancied
she
was
in
a
perfect
cemetery
the
snow
paved
the
ground
with
white
the
high
frontages
livid
grey
in
tint
rose
up
unlighted
like
ruined
walls
and
not
a
sigh
could
be
heard
it
seemed
as
if
a
whole
village
stiffened
with
cold
and
hunger
were
buried
here
she
had
to
step
over
a
black
gutter
water
from
the
which
smoked
and
streaked
the
whiteness
of
the
snow
with
its
muddy
course
it
was
the
color
of
her
thoughts
the
beautiful
light
blue
and
light
pink
waters
had
long
since
flowed
away
then
whilst
ascending
the
six
flights
of
stairs
in
the
dark
she
could
not
prevent
herself
from
laughing
an
ugly
laugh
which
hurt
her
she
recalled
her
ideal
of
former
days
to
work
quietly
always
have
bread
to
eat
and
a
tidy
house
to
sleep
in
to
bring
up
her
children
not
to
be
beaten
and
to
die
in
her
bed
no
really
it
was
comical
how
all
that
was
becoming
realized
she
no
longer
worked
she
no
longer
ate
she
slept
on
filth
her
husband
frequented
all
sorts
of
wineshops
and
her
husband
drubbed
her
at
all
hours
of
the
day
all
that
was
left
for
her
to
do
was
to
die
on
the
pavement
and
it
would
not
take
long
if
on
getting
into
her
room
she
could
only
pluck
up
courage
to
fling
herself
out
of
the
window
was
it
not
enough
to
make
one
think
that
she
had
hoped
to
earn
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
no
end
of
respect
ah
really
in
this
life
it
is
no
use
being
modest
one
only
gets
sat
upon
not
even
pap
and
a
nest
that
is
the
common
lot
what
increased
her
ugly
laugh
was
the
recollection
of
her
grand
hope
of
retiring
into
the
country
after
twenty
years
passed
in
ironing
well
she
was
on
her
way
to
the
country
she
was
going
to
have
her
green
corner
in
the
cemetery
when
she
entered
the
passage
she
was
like
a
her
poor
head
was
whirling
round
at
heart
her
great
grief
was
at
having
bid
the
blacksmith
an
eternal
farewell
all
was
ended
between
them
they
would
never
see
each
other
more
then
besides
that
all
her
other
thoughts
of
misfortune
pressed
upon
her
and
almost
caused
her
head
to
split
as
she
passed
she
poked
her
nose
in
at
the
bijards
and
beheld
lalie
dead
with
a
look
of
contentment
on
her
face
at
having
at
last
been
laid
out
and
slumbering
forever
ah
well
children
were
luckier
than
people
and
as
a
glimmer
of
light
passed
under
old
bazouge
door
she
walked
boldly
in
seized
with
a
mania
for
going
off
on
the
same
journey
as
the
little
one
that
old
joker
bazouge
had
come
home
that
night
in
an
extraordinary
state
of
gaiety
he
had
had
such
a
booze
that
he
was
snoring
on
the
ground
in
spite
of
the
temperature
and
that
no
doubt
did
not
prevent
him
from
dreaming
something
pleasant
for
he
seemed
to
be
laughing
from
his
stomach
as
he
slept
the
candle
which
he
had
not
put
out
lighted
up
his
old
garments
his
black
cloak
which
he
had
drawn
over
his
knees
as
though
it
had
been
a
blanket
on
beholding
him
gervaise
uttered
such
a
deep
wailing
that
he
awoke
dieu
shut
the
door
it
so
cold
ah
it
you
what
the
matter
what
do
you
want
then
gervaise
stretching
out
her
arms
no
longer
knowing
what
she
stuttered
began
passionately
to
implore
him
oh
take
me
away
i
had
enough
i
want
to
go
off
you
must
bear
me
any
grudge
i
did
know
one
never
knows
until
one
ready
oh
yes
one
glad
to
go
one
day
take
me
away
take
me
away
and
i
shall
thank
you
she
fell
on
her
knees
all
shaken
with
a
desire
which
caused
her
to
turn
ghastly
pale
never
before
had
she
thus
dragged
herself
at
a
man
feet
old
bazouge
ugly
mug
with
his
mouth
all
on
one
side
and
his
hide
begrimed
with
the
dust
of
funerals
seemed
to
her
as
beautiful
and
resplendent
as
a
sun
the
old
fellow
who
was
scarcely
awake
thought
however
that
it
was
some
sort
of
bad
joke
look
here
murmured
he
no
jokes
take
me
away
repeated
gervaise
more
ardently
still
you
remember
i
knocked
one
evening
against
the
partition
then
i
said
that
it
true
because
i
was
still
a
fool
but
see
give
me
your
hands
i
no
longer
frightened
take
me
away
to
you
see
how
still
i
be
oh
sleep
that
all
i
care
for
oh
i
love
you
so
much
bazouge
ever
gallant
thought
that
he
ought
not
to
be
hasty
with
a
lady
who
appeared
to
have
taken
such
a
fancy
to
him
she
was
falling
to
pieces
but
all
the
same
what
remained
was
very
fine
especially
when
she
was
excited
what
you
say
is
very
true
said
he
in
a
convinced
manner
i
packed
up
three
more
who
would
only
have
been
too
glad
to
have
given
me
something
for
myself
could
they
but
have
got
their
hands
to
their
pockets
but
little
woman
it
not
so
easily
settled
as
all
that
take
me
away
take
me
away
continued
gervaise
i
want
to
die
ah
but
there
a
little
operation
to
be
gone
through
beforehand
you
know
glug
and
he
made
a
noise
in
his
throat
as
though
swallowing
his
tongue
then
thinking
it
a
good
joke
he
chuckled
gervaise
slowly
rose
to
her
feet
so
he
too
could
do
nothing
for
her
she
went
to
her
room
and
threw
herself
on
her
straw
feeling
stupid
and
regretting
she
had
eaten
ah
no
indeed
misery
did
not
kill
quickly
enough
chapter
xiii
that
night
coupeau
went
on
a
spree
next
day
gervaise
received
ten
francs
from
her
son
etienne
who
was
a
mechanic
on
some
railway
the
youngster
sent
her
a
few
francs
from
time
to
time
knowing
that
they
were
not
very
well
off
at
home
she
made
some
soup
and
ate
it
all
alone
for
that
scoundrel
coupeau
did
not
return
on
the
morrow
on
monday
he
was
still
absent
and
on
tuesday
also
the
whole
week
went
by
ah
it
would
be
good
luck
if
some
woman
took
him
in
on
sunday
gervaise
received
a
printed
document
it
was
to
inform
her
that
her
husband
was
dying
at
the
asylum
gervaise
did
not
disturb
herself
he
knew
the
way
he
could
very
well
get
home
from
the
asylum
by
himself
they
had
cured
him
there
so
often
that
they
could
once
more
do
him
the
sorry
service
of
putting
him
on
his
pins
again
had
she
not
heard
that
very
morning
that
for
the
week
before
coupeau
had
been
seen
as
round
as
a
ball
rolling
about
belleville
from
one
dram
shop
to
another
in
the
company
of
exactly
so
and
it
was
too
who
stood
treat
he
must
have
hooked
his
stocking
with
all
the
savings
gained
at
very
hard
work
it
was
clean
money
they
had
used
but
money
that
could
infect
them
with
any
manner
of
vile
diseases
well
anyway
they
had
thought
to
invite
her
for
a
drink
if
you
wanted
to
drink
by
yourself
you
could
croak
by
yourself
however
on
monday
as
gervaise
had
a
nice
little
meal
planned
for
the
evening
the
remains
of
some
beans
and
a
pint
of
wine
she
pretended
to
herself
that
a
walk
would
give
her
an
appetite
the
letter
from
the
asylum
which
she
had
left
lying
on
the
bureau
bothered
her
the
snow
had
melted
the
day
was
mild
and
grey
and
on
the
whole
fine
with
just
a
slight
keenness
in
the
air
which
was
invigorating
she
started
at
noon
for
her
walk
was
a
long
one
she
had
to
cross
paris
and
her
bad
leg
always
slowed
her
with
that
the
streets
were
crowded
but
the
people
amused
her
she
reached
her
destination
very
pleasantly
when
she
had
given
her
name
she
was
told
a
most
astounding
story
to
the
effect
that
coupeau
had
been
fished
out
of
the
seine
close
to
the
he
had
jumped
over
the
parapet
under
the
impression
that
a
bearded
man
was
barring
his
way
a
fine
jump
was
it
not
and
as
for
finding
out
how
coupeau
got
to
be
on
the
that
was
a
matter
he
could
not
even
explain
himself
one
of
the
keepers
escorted
gervaise
she
was
ascending
a
staircase
when
she
heard
howlings
which
made
her
shiver
to
her
very
bones
he
playing
a
nice
music
is
he
observed
the
keeper
who
is
asked
she
why
your
old
man
he
been
yelling
like
that
ever
since
the
day
before
yesterday
and
he
dances
you
just
see
dieu
what
a
sight
she
stood
as
one
transfixed
the
cell
was
padded
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
on
the
floor
there
were
two
straw
mats
one
piled
on
top
of
the
other
and
in
a
corner
were
spread
a
mattress
and
a
bolster
nothing
more
inside
there
coupeau
was
dancing
and
yelling
his
blouse
in
tatters
and
his
limbs
beating
the
air
he
wore
the
mask
of
one
about
to
die
what
a
breakdown
he
bumped
up
against
the
window
then
retired
backwards
beating
time
with
his
arms
and
shaking
his
hands
as
though
he
were
trying
to
wrench
them
off
and
fling
them
in
somebody
face
one
meets
with
buffoons
in
low
dancing
places
who
imitate
the
delirium
tremens
only
they
imitate
it
badly
one
must
see
this
drunkard
dance
if
one
wishes
to
know
what
it
is
like
when
gone
through
in
earnest
the
song
also
has
its
merits
a
continuous
yell
worthy
of
a
mouth
wide
open
uttering
the
same
hoarse
trombone
notes
for
hours
together
coupeau
had
the
howl
of
a
beast
with
a
crushed
paw
strike
up
music
gentlemen
choose
your
partners
dieu
what
is
the
matter
with
him
what
is
the
matter
with
him
repeated
gervaise
seized
with
fear
a
house
surgeon
a
big
fair
fellow
with
a
rosy
countenance
and
wearing
a
white
apron
was
quietly
sitting
taking
notes
the
case
was
a
curious
one
the
doctor
did
not
leave
the
patient
stay
a
while
if
you
like
said
he
to
the
laundress
but
keep
quiet
try
and
speak
to
him
he
will
not
recognise
you
coupeau
indeed
did
not
even
appear
to
see
his
wife
she
had
only
had
a
bad
view
of
him
on
entering
he
was
wriggling
about
so
much
when
she
looked
him
full
in
the
face
she
stood
aghast
dieu
was
it
possible
he
had
a
countenance
like
that
his
eyes
full
of
blood
and
his
lips
covered
with
scabs
she
would
certainly
never
have
known
him
to
begin
with
he
was
making
too
many
grimaces
without
saying
why
his
mouth
suddenly
out
of
all
shape
his
nose
curled
up
his
cheeks
drawn
in
a
perfect
animal
muzzle
his
skin
was
so
hot
the
air
steamed
around
him
and
his
hide
was
as
though
varnished
covered
with
a
heavy
sweat
which
trickled
off
him
in
his
mad
dance
one
could
see
all
the
same
that
he
was
not
at
his
ease
his
head
was
heavy
and
his
limbs
ached
gervaise
drew
near
to
the
house
surgeon
who
was
strumming
a
tune
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
on
the
back
of
his
chair
tell
me
sir
it
serious
then
this
time
the
house
surgeon
nodded
his
head
without
answering
is
he
jabbering
to
himself
eh
do
you
hear
what
it
about
about
things
he
sees
murmured
the
young
man
keep
quiet
let
me
listen
coupeau
was
speaking
in
a
jerky
voice
a
glimmer
of
amusement
lit
up
his
eyes
he
looked
on
the
floor
to
the
right
to
the
left
and
turned
about
as
though
he
had
been
strolling
in
the
bois
de
vincennes
conversing
with
himself
ah
that
nice
that
grand
there
cottages
a
regular
fair
and
some
jolly
fine
music
what
a
balthazar
feast
they
smashing
the
crockery
in
there
awfully
swell
now
it
being
lit
up
red
balls
in
the
air
and
it
jumps
and
it
flies
oh
oh
what
a
lot
of
lanterns
in
the
trees
it
confoundedly
pleasant
there
water
flowing
everywhere
fountains
cascades
water
which
sings
oh
with
the
voice
of
a
chorister
the
cascades
are
grand
and
he
drew
himself
up
as
though
the
better
to
hear
the
delicious
song
of
the
water
he
sucked
in
forcibly
fancying
he
was
drinking
the
fresh
spray
blown
from
the
fountains
but
little
by
little
his
face
resumed
an
agonized
expression
then
he
crouched
down
and
flew
quicker
than
ever
around
the
walls
of
the
cell
uttering
vague
threats
more
traps
all
that
i
thought
as
much
silence
you
set
of
swindlers
yes
you
making
a
fool
of
me
it
for
that
that
you
drinking
and
bawling
inside
there
with
your
viragoes
i
demolish
you
you
and
your
cottage
damnation
will
you
leave
me
in
peace
he
clinched
his
fists
then
he
uttered
a
hoarse
cry
stooping
as
he
ran
and
he
stuttered
his
teeth
chattering
with
fright
it
so
that
i
may
kill
myself
no
i
wo
throw
myself
in
all
that
water
means
that
i
no
heart
no
i
wo
throw
myself
in
the
cascades
which
fled
at
his
approach
advanced
when
he
retired
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
looked
stupidly
around
him
mumbling
in
a
voice
which
was
scarcely
audible
it
is
possible
they
set
conjurers
against
me
i
off
sir
i
got
to
go
said
gervaise
to
the
house
surgeon
it
upsets
me
too
much
i
come
again
she
was
quite
white
coupeau
was
continuing
his
breakdown
from
the
window
to
the
mattress
and
from
the
mattress
to
the
window
perspiring
toiling
always
beating
the
same
rhythm
then
she
hurried
away
but
though
she
scrambled
down
the
stairs
she
still
heard
her
confounded
jig
until
she
reached
the
bottom
ah
dieu
how
pleasant
it
was
out
of
doors
one
could
breathe
there
that
evening
everyone
in
the
tenement
was
discussing
coupeau
strange
malady
the
boches
invited
gervaise
to
have
a
drink
with
them
even
though
they
now
considered
beneath
them
in
order
to
hear
all
the
details
madame
lorilleux
and
madame
poisson
were
there
also
boche
told
of
a
carpenter
he
had
known
who
had
been
a
drinker
of
absinthe
the
man
shed
his
clothes
went
out
in
the
street
and
danced
the
polka
until
he
died
that
rather
struck
the
ladies
as
comic
even
though
it
was
very
sad
gervaise
got
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
did
an
imitation
of
coupeau
yes
that
just
how
it
was
can
anyone
feature
a
man
doing
that
for
hours
on
end
if
they
did
believe
they
could
go
see
for
themselves
on
getting
up
the
next
morning
gervaise
promised
herself
she
would
not
return
to
the
again
what
use
would
it
be
she
did
not
want
to
go
off
her
head
also
however
every
ten
minutes
she
fell
to
musing
and
became
it
would
be
curious
though
if
he
were
still
throwing
his
legs
about
when
twelve
struck
she
could
no
longer
resist
she
started
off
and
did
not
notice
how
long
the
walk
was
her
brain
was
so
full
of
her
desire
to
go
and
the
dread
of
what
awaited
her
oh
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
ask
for
news
she
heard
coupeau
song
the
moment
she
reached
the
foot
of
the
staircase
just
the
same
tune
just
the
same
dance
she
might
have
thought
herself
going
up
again
after
having
only
been
down
for
a
minute
the
attendant
of
the
day
before
who
was
carrying
some
jugs
of
tisane
along
the
corridor
winked
his
eye
as
he
met
her
by
way
of
being
amiable
still
the
same
then
said
she
oh
still
the
same
he
replied
without
stopping
she
entered
the
room
but
she
remained
near
the
door
because
there
were
some
people
with
coupeau
the
fair
rosy
house
surgeon
was
standing
up
having
given
his
chair
to
a
bald
old
gentleman
who
was
decorated
and
had
a
pointed
face
like
a
weasel
he
was
no
doubt
the
head
doctor
for
his
glance
was
as
sharp
and
piercing
as
a
gimlet
all
the
dealers
in
sudden
death
have
a
glance
like
that
no
really
it
was
not
a
pretty
sight
and
gervaise
all
in
a
tremble
asked
herself
why
she
had
returned
to
think
that
the
evening
before
they
accused
her
at
the
boches
of
exaggerating
the
picture
now
she
saw
better
how
coupeau
set
about
it
his
eyes
wide
open
looking
into
space
and
she
would
never
forget
it
she
overheard
a
few
words
between
the
house
surgeon
and
the
head
doctor
the
former
was
giving
some
details
of
the
night
her
husband
had
talked
and
thrown
himself
about
that
was
what
it
amounted
to
then
the
old
gentleman
who
was
not
very
polite
by
the
way
at
length
appeared
to
become
aware
of
her
presence
and
when
the
house
surgeon
had
informed
him
that
she
was
the
patient
wife
he
began
to
question
her
in
the
harsh
manner
of
a
commissary
of
the
police
did
this
man
father
drink
yes
sir
just
a
little
like
everyone
he
killed
himself
by
falling
from
a
roof
one
day
when
he
was
tipsy
did
his
mother
drink
well
sir
like
everyone
else
you
know
a
drop
here
a
drop
there
oh
the
family
is
very
respectable
there
was
a
brother
who
died
very
young
in
convulsions
the
doctor
looked
at
her
with
his
piercing
eye
he
resumed
in
his
rough
voice
and
you
you
drink
too
do
you
gervaise
stammered
protested
and
placed
her
hand
upon
her
heart
as
though
to
take
her
solemn
oath
you
drink
take
care
see
where
drink
leads
to
one
day
or
other
you
will
die
thus
then
she
remained
close
to
the
wall
the
doctor
had
turned
his
back
to
her
he
squatted
down
without
troubling
himself
as
to
whether
his
overcoat
trailed
in
the
dust
of
the
matting
for
a
long
while
he
studied
coupeau
trembling
waiting
for
its
reappearance
following
it
with
his
glance
that
day
the
legs
were
going
in
their
turn
the
trembling
had
descended
from
the
hands
to
the
feet
a
regular
puppet
with
his
strings
being
pulled
throwing
his
limbs
about
whilst
the
trunk
of
his
body
remained
as
stiff
as
a
piece
of
wood
the
disease
progressed
little
by
little
it
was
like
a
musical
box
beneath
the
skin
it
started
off
every
three
or
four
seconds
and
rolled
along
for
an
instant
then
it
stopped
and
then
it
started
off
again
just
the
same
as
the
little
shiver
which
shakes
stray
dogs
in
winter
when
cold
and
standing
in
some
doorway
for
protection
already
the
middle
of
the
body
and
the
shoulders
quivered
like
water
on
the
point
of
boiling
it
was
a
funny
demolition
all
the
same
going
off
wriggling
like
a
girl
being
tickled
coupeau
meanwhile
was
complaining
in
a
hollow
voice
he
seemed
to
suffer
a
great
deal
more
than
the
day
before
his
broken
murmurs
disclosed
all
sorts
of
ailments
thousands
of
pins
were
pricking
him
he
felt
something
heavy
all
about
his
body
some
cold
wet
animal
was
crawling
over
his
thighs
and
digging
its
fangs
into
his
flesh
then
there
were
other
animals
sticking
to
his
shoulders
tearing
his
back
with
their
claws
i
thirsty
oh
i
thirsty
groaned
he
continually
the
house
surgeon
handed
him
a
little
lemonade
from
a
small
shelf
coupeau
seized
the
mug
in
both
hands
and
greedily
took
a
mouthful
spilling
half
the
liquid
over
himself
but
he
spat
it
out
at
once
with
furious
disgust
exclaiming
damnation
it
brandy
then
on
a
sign
from
the
doctor
the
house
surgeon
tried
to
make
him
drink
some
water
without
leaving
go
of
the
bottle
this
time
he
swallowed
the
mouthful
yelling
as
though
he
had
swallowed
fire
it
brandy
damnation
it
brandy
since
the
night
before
everything
he
had
had
to
drink
was
brandy
it
redoubled
his
thirst
and
he
could
no
longer
drink
because
everything
burnt
him
they
had
brought
him
some
broth
but
they
were
evidently
trying
to
poison
him
for
the
broth
smelt
of
vitriol
the
bread
was
sour
and
moldy
there
was
nothing
but
poison
around
him
the
cell
stank
of
sulphur
he
even
accused
persons
of
rubbing
matches
under
his
nose
to
infect
him
all
on
a
sudden
he
exclaimed
oh
the
rats
there
the
rats
now
there
were
black
balls
that
were
changing
into
rats
these
filthy
animals
got
fatter
and
fatter
then
they
jumped
onto
the
mattress
and
disappeared
there
was
also
a
monkey
which
came
out
of
the
wall
and
went
back
into
the
wall
and
which
approached
so
near
him
each
time
that
he
drew
back
through
fear
of
having
his
nose
bitten
off
suddenly
there
was
another
change
the
walls
were
probably
cutting
capers
for
he
yelled
out
choking
with
terror
and
rage
that
it
gee
up
shake
me
i
do
care
gee
up
tumble
down
yes
ring
the
bells
you
black
crows
play
the
organ
to
prevent
my
calling
the
police
they
put
a
bomb
behind
the
wall
the
lousy
scoundrels
i
can
hear
it
it
snorts
they
going
to
blow
us
up
fire
damnation
fire
there
a
cry
of
fire
there
it
blazes
oh
it
getting
lighter
lighter
all
the
sky
burning
red
fires
green
fires
yellow
fires
hi
help
fire
his
cries
became
lost
in
a
rattle
he
now
only
mumbled
disconnected
words
foaming
at
the
mouth
his
chin
wet
with
saliva
the
doctor
rubbed
his
nose
with
his
finger
a
movement
no
doubt
habitual
with
him
in
the
presence
of
serious
cases
he
turned
to
the
house
surgeon
and
asked
him
in
a
low
voice
and
the
temperature
still
the
hundred
degrees
is
it
not
yes
sir
the
doctor
pursed
his
lips
he
continued
there
another
two
minutes
his
eyes
fixed
on
coupeau
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
adding
the
same
treatment
broth
milk
lemonade
and
the
potion
of
extract
of
quinine
do
not
leave
him
and
call
me
if
necessary
he
went
out
and
gervaise
followed
him
to
ask
him
if
there
was
any
hope
but
he
walked
so
stiffly
along
the
corridor
that
she
did
not
dare
approach
him
she
stood
rooted
there
a
minute
hesitating
whether
to
return
and
look
at
her
husband
the
time
she
had
already
passed
had
been
far
from
pleasant
as
she
again
heard
him
calling
out
that
the
lemonade
smelt
of
brandy
she
hurried
away
having
had
enough
of
the
performance
in
the
streets
the
galloping
of
the
horses
and
the
noise
of
the
vehicles
made
her
fancy
that
all
the
inmates
of
were
at
her
heels
and
that
the
doctor
had
threatened
her
really
she
already
thought
she
had
the
complaint
in
the
rue
de
la
the
boches
and
the
others
were
naturally
awaiting
her
the
moment
she
appeared
they
called
her
into
the
concierge
room
well
was
old
coupeau
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
dieu
yes
he
still
lived
boche
seemed
amazed
and
confounded
he
had
bet
a
bottle
that
old
coupeau
would
not
last
till
the
evening
what
he
still
lived
and
they
all
exhibited
their
astonishment
and
slapped
their
thighs
there
was
a
fellow
who
lasted
madame
lorilleux
reckoned
up
the
hours
hours
and
hours
sixty
hours
dieu
already
sixty
hours
that
he
had
been
doing
the
jig
and
screaming
such
a
feat
of
strength
had
never
been
seen
before
but
boche
who
was
upset
that
he
had
lost
the
bet
questioned
gervaise
with
an
air
of
doubt
asking
her
if
she
was
quite
sure
he
had
not
filed
off
behind
her
back
oh
no
he
had
no
desire
to
he
jumped
about
too
much
then
boche
still
doubting
begged
her
to
show
them
again
a
little
how
he
was
acting
just
so
they
could
see
yes
yes
a
little
more
the
request
was
general
the
company
told
her
she
would
be
very
kind
if
she
would
oblige
for
just
then
two
neighbors
happened
to
be
there
who
had
not
been
present
the
day
before
and
who
had
come
down
purposely
to
see
the
performance
the
concierge
called
to
everybody
to
make
room
they
cleared
the
centre
of
the
apartment
pushing
one
another
with
their
elbows
and
quivering
with
curiosity
gervaise
however
hung
down
her
head
really
she
was
afraid
it
might
upset
her
desirous
though
of
showing
that
she
did
not
refuse
for
the
sake
of
being
pressed
she
tried
two
or
three
little
leaps
but
she
became
quite
queer
and
stopped
on
her
word
of
honor
she
was
not
equal
to
it
there
was
a
murmur
of
disappointment
it
was
a
pity
she
imitated
it
perfectly
however
she
could
not
do
it
it
was
no
use
insisting
and
when
virginie
left
to
return
to
her
shop
they
forgot
all
about
old
coupeau
and
began
to
gossip
about
the
poissons
and
their
home
a
real
mess
now
the
day
before
the
bailiffs
had
been
the
policeman
was
about
to
lose
his
place
as
for
lantier
he
was
now
making
up
to
the
daughter
of
the
restaurant
keeper
next
door
a
fine
woman
who
talked
of
setting
up
as
a
ah
it
was
amusing
everyone
already
beheld
a
occupying
the
shop
after
the
sweets
should
come
something
substantial
and
that
blind
poisson
how
could
a
man
whose
profession
required
him
to
be
so
smart
fail
to
see
what
was
going
on
in
his
own
home
they
stopped
talking
suddenly
when
they
noticed
that
gervaise
was
off
in
a
corner
by
herself
imitating
coupeau
her
hands
and
feet
were
jerking
yes
they
could
ask
for
a
better
performance
then
gervaise
started
as
if
waking
from
a
dream
and
hurried
away
calling
out
to
everyone
on
the
morrow
the
boches
saw
her
start
off
at
twelve
the
same
as
on
the
two
previous
days
they
wished
her
a
pleasant
afternoon
that
day
the
corridor
at
positively
shook
with
coupeau
yells
and
kicks
she
had
not
left
the
stairs
when
she
heard
him
yelling
what
a
lot
of
bugs
come
this
way
again
that
i
may
squash
you
ah
they
want
to
kill
me
ah
the
bugs
i
a
bigger
swell
than
the
lot
of
you
clear
out
damnation
clear
out
for
a
moment
she
stood
panting
before
the
door
was
he
then
fighting
against
an
army
when
she
entered
the
performance
had
increased
and
was
embellished
even
more
than
on
previous
occasions
coupeau
was
a
raving
madman
the
same
as
one
sees
at
the
charenton
he
was
throwing
himself
about
in
the
center
of
the
cell
slamming
his
fists
everywhere
on
himself
on
the
walls
on
the
floor
and
stumbling
about
punching
empty
space
he
wanted
to
open
the
window
and
he
hid
himself
defended
himself
called
answered
produced
all
this
uproar
without
the
least
assistance
in
the
exasperated
way
of
a
man
beset
by
a
mob
of
people
then
gervaise
understood
that
he
fancied
he
was
on
a
roof
laying
down
sheets
of
zinc
he
imitated
the
bellows
with
his
mouth
he
moved
the
iron
about
in
the
fire
and
knelt
down
so
as
to
pass
his
thumb
along
the
edges
of
the
mat
thinking
that
he
was
soldering
it
yes
his
handicraft
returned
to
him
at
the
moment
of
croaking
and
if
he
yelled
so
loud
if
he
fought
on
his
roof
it
was
because
ugly
scoundrels
were
preventing
him
doing
his
work
properly
on
all
the
neighboring
roofs
were
villains
mocking
and
tormenting
him
besides
that
the
jokers
were
letting
troops
of
rats
loose
about
his
legs
ah
the
filthy
beasts
he
saw
them
always
though
he
kept
crushing
them
bringing
his
foot
down
with
all
his
strength
fresh
hordes
of
them
continued
passing
until
they
quite
covered
the
roof
and
there
were
spiders
there
too
he
roughly
pressed
his
trousers
against
his
thigh
to
squash
some
big
spiders
which
had
crept
up
his
leg
dieu
he
would
never
finish
his
day
work
they
wanted
to
destroy
him
his
employer
would
send
him
to
prison
then
whilst
making
haste
he
suddenly
imagined
he
had
a
in
his
stomach
with
his
mouth
wide
open
he
puffed
out
the
smoke
a
dense
smoke
which
filled
the
cell
and
found
an
outlet
by
the
window
and
bending
forward
still
puffing
he
looked
outside
of
the
cloud
of
smoke
as
it
unrolled
and
ascended
to
the
sky
where
it
hid
the
sun
look
cried
he
there
the
band
of
the
chaussee
clignancourt
disguised
as
bears
with
drums
putting
on
a
show
he
remained
crouching
before
the
window
as
though
he
had
been
watching
a
procession
in
a
street
from
some
rooftop
there
the
cavalcade
lions
and
panthers
making
grimaces
brats
dressed
up
as
dogs
and
cats
there
tall
clemence
with
her
wig
full
of
feathers
ah
dieu
she
turning
head
over
heels
showed
everything
you
better
run
duckie
hey
the
cops
leave
her
alone
just
you
leave
her
alone
do
shoot
do
shoot
his
voice
rose
hoarse
and
terrified
and
he
stooped
down
quickly
saying
that
the
police
and
the
military
were
below
men
who
were
aiming
at
him
with
rifles
in
the
wall
he
saw
the
barrel
of
a
pistol
emerging
pointed
at
his
breast
they
had
dragged
the
girl
away
do
shoot
dieu
do
shoot
then
the
buildings
were
tumbling
down
he
imitated
the
cracking
of
a
whole
neighborhood
collapsing
and
all
disappeared
all
flew
off
but
he
had
no
time
to
take
breath
other
pictures
passed
with
extraordinary
rapidity
a
furious
desire
to
speak
filled
his
mouth
full
of
words
which
he
uttered
without
any
connection
and
with
a
gurgling
sound
in
his
throat
he
continued
to
raise
his
voice
louder
and
louder
hallow
it
you
no
jokes
do
make
me
nuzzle
your
hair
and
he
passed
his
hand
before
his
face
he
blew
to
send
the
hairs
away
the
house
surgeon
questioned
him
who
is
it
you
see
my
wife
of
course
he
was
looking
at
the
wall
with
his
back
to
gervaise
the
latter
had
a
rare
fright
and
she
examined
the
wall
to
see
if
she
also
could
catch
sight
of
herself
there
he
continued
talking
now
you
know
none
of
your
wheedling
i
wo
be
tied
down

are
pretty

have
got
a
fine

skirts
who

stoop
down
that
i
may
see
damnation
it
him
again
with
a
terrible
leap
he
went
head
first
against
the
wall
but
the
padding
softened
the
blow
one
only
heard
his
body
rebounding
onto
the
matting
where
the
shock
had
sent
him
who
is
it
you
see
repeated
the
house
surgeon
the
hatter
the
hatter
yelled
coupeau
and
the
house
surgeon
questioning
gervaise
the
latter
stuttered
without
being
able
to
answer
for
this
scene
stirred
up
within
her
all
the
worries
of
her
life
the
thrust
out
his
fists
we
settle
this
between
us
my
lad
it
full
time
i
did
for
you

virago
on
your
arm

make
a
fool
of
me
before
everyone

to
throttle

i
and
without
putting
any
gloves
on
either
i
stop
your
swaggering
take
that
and
that
and
that
he
hit
about
in
the
air
viciously
then
a
wild
rage
took
possession
of
him
having
bumped
against
the
wall
in
walking
backwards
he
thought
he
was
being
attacked
from
behind
he
turned
round
and
fiercely
hammered
away
at
the
padding
he
sprang
about
jumped
from
one
corner
to
another
knocked
his
stomach
his
back
his
shoulder
rolled
over
and
picked
himself
up
again
his
bones
seemed
softened
his
flesh
had
a
sound
like
damp
oakum
he
accompanied
this
pretty
game
with
atrocious
threats
and
wild
and
guttural
cries
however
the
battle
must
have
been
going
badly
for
him
for
his
breathing
became
quicker
his
eyes
were
starting
out
of
his
head
and
he
seemed
little
by
little
to
be
seized
with
the
cowardice
of
a
child
murder
murder
be
off
with
you
both
oh
you
brutes
they
laughing
there
she
is
on
her
back
the
virago
she
must
give
in
it
settled
ah
the
brigand
he
murdering
her
he
cutting
off
her
leg
with
his
knife
the
other
leg
on
the
ground
the
stomach
in
two
it
full
of
blood
oh
dieu
oh
dieu
and
covered
with
perspiration
his
hair
standing
on
end
looking
a
frightful
object
he
retired
backwards
violently
waving
his
arms
as
though
to
send
the
abominable
sight
from
him
he
uttered
two
wails
and
fell
flat
on
his
back
on
the
mattress
against
which
his
heels
had
caught
he
dead
sir
he
dead
said
gervaise
clasping
her
hands
the
house
surgeon
had
drawn
near
and
was
pulling
coupeau
into
the
middle
of
the
mattress
no
he
was
not
dead
they
had
taken
his
shoes
off
his
bare
feet
hung
off
the
end
of
the
mattress
and
they
were
dancing
all
by
themselves
one
beside
the
other
in
time
a
little
hurried
and
regular
dance
just
then
the
head
doctor
entered
he
had
brought
two
of
his
colleagues
one
thin
the
other
fat
and
both
decorated
like
himself
all
three
stooped
down
without
saying
a
word
and
examined
the
man
all
over
then
they
rapidly
conversed
together
in
a
low
voice
they
had
uncovered
coupeau
from
his
thighs
to
his
shoulders
and
by
standing
on
tiptoe
gervaise
could
see
the
naked
trunk
spread
out
well
it
was
complete
the
trembling
had
descended
from
the
arms
and
ascended
from
the
legs
and
now
the
trunk
itself
was
getting
lively
he
sleeping
murmured
the
head
doctor
and
he
called
the
two
others
attention
to
the
man
countenance
coupeau
his
eyes
closed
had
little
nervous
twinges
which
drew
up
all
his
face
he
was
more
hideous
still
thus
flattened
out
with
his
jaw
projecting
and
his
visage
deformed
like
a
corpse
that
had
suffered
from
nightmare
but
the
doctors
having
caught
sight
of
his
feet
went
and
poked
their
noses
over
them
with
an
air
of
profound
interest
the
feet
were
still
dancing
though
coupeau
slept
the
feet
danced
oh
their
owner
might
snore
that
did
not
concern
them
they
continued
their
little
occupation
without
either
hurrying
or
slackening
regular
mechanical
feet
feet
which
took
their
pleasure
wherever
they
found
it
gervaise
having
seen
the
doctors
place
their
hands
on
her
old
man
wished
to
feel
him
also
she
approached
gently
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
she
kept
it
there
a
minute
dieu
whatever
was
taking
place
inside
it
danced
down
into
the
very
depths
of
the
flesh
the
bones
themselves
must
have
been
jumping
quiverings
undulations
coming
from
afar
flowed
like
a
river
beneath
the
skin
when
she
pressed
a
little
she
felt
she
distinguished
the
suffering
cries
of
the
marrow
what
a
fearful
thing
something
was
boring
away
like
a
mole
it
must
be
the
rotgut
from
that
was
hacking
away
inside
him
well
his
entire
body
had
been
soaked
in
it
the
doctors
had
gone
away
at
the
end
of
an
hour
gervaise
who
had
remained
with
the
house
surgeon
repeated
in
a
low
voice
he
dead
sir
he
dead
but
the
house
surgeon
who
was
watching
the
feet
shook
his
head
the
bare
feet
projecting
beyond
the
mattress
still
danced
on
they
were
not
particularly
clean
and
the
nails
were
long
several
more
hours
passed
all
on
a
sudden
they
stiffened
and
became
motionless
then
the
house
surgeon
turned
towards
gervaise
saying
it
over
now
death
alone
had
been
able
to
stop
those
feet
when
gervaise
got
back
to
the
rue
de
la
she
found
at
the
boches
a
number
of
women
who
were
cackling
in
excited
tones
she
thought
they
were
awaiting
her
to
have
the
latest
news
the
same
as
the
other
days
he
gone
said
she
quietly
as
she
pushed
open
the
door
looking
tired
out
and
dull
but
no
one
listened
to
her
the
whole
building
was
oh
a
most
extraordinary
story
poisson
had
caught
his
wife
with
lantier
exact
details
were
not
known
because
everyone
had
a
different
version
however
he
had
appeared
just
when
they
were
not
expecting
him
some
further
information
was
given
which
the
ladies
repeated
to
one
another
as
they
pursed
their
lips
a
sight
like
that
had
naturally
brought
poisson
out
of
his
shell
he
was
a
regular
tiger
this
man
who
talked
but
little
and
who
always
seemed
to
walk
with
a
stick
up
his
back
had
begun
to
roar
and
jump
about
then
nothing
more
had
been
heard
lantier
had
evidently
explained
things
to
the
husband
anyhow
it
could
not
last
much
longer
and
boche
announced
that
the
girl
of
the
restaurant
was
for
certain
going
to
take
the
shop
for
selling
tripe
that
rogue
of
a
hatter
adored
tripe
on
seeing
madame
lorilleux
and
madame
lerat
arrive
gervaise
repeated
faintly
he
gone
dieu
four
days
dancing
and
yelling
then
the
two
sisters
could
not
do
otherwise
than
pull
out
their
handkerchiefs
their
brother
had
had
many
faults
but
after
all
he
was
their
brother
boche
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
everyone
bah
it
a
drunkard
the
less
from
that
day
as
gervaise
often
got
a
bit
befuddled
one
of
the
amusements
of
the
house
was
to
see
her
imitate
coupeau
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
press
her
she
gave
the
performance
gratis
her
hands
and
feet
trembling
as
she
uttered
little
involuntary
shrieks
she
must
have
caught
this
habit
at
from
watching
her
husband
too
long
gervaise
lasted
in
this
state
several
months
she
fell
lower
and
lower
still
submitting
to
the
grossest
outrages
and
dying
of
starvation
a
little
every
day
as
soon
as
she
had
four
sous
she
drank
and
pounded
on
the
walls
she
was
employed
on
all
the
dirty
errands
of
the
neighborhood
once
they
even
bet
her
she
would
eat
filth
but
she
did
it
in
order
to
earn
ten
sous
monsieur
marescot
had
decided
to
turn
her
out
of
her
room
on
the
sixth
floor
but
as
pere
bru
had
just
been
found
dead
in
his
cubbyhole
under
the
staircase
the
landlord
had
allowed
her
to
turn
into
it
now
she
roosted
there
in
the
place
of
pere
bru
it
was
inside
there
on
some
straw
that
her
teeth
chattered
whilst
her
stomach
was
empty
and
her
bones
were
frozen
the
earth
would
not
have
her
apparently
she
was
becoming
idiotic
she
did
not
even
think
of
making
an
end
of
herself
by
jumping
out
of
the
sixth
floor
window
on
to
the
pavement
of
the
courtyard
below
death
had
to
take
her
little
by
little
bit
by
bit
dragging
her
thus
to
the
end
through
the
accursed
existence
she
had
made
for
herself
it
was
never
even
exactly
known
what
she
did
die
of
there
was
some
talk
of
a
cold
but
the
truth
was
she
died
of
privation
and
of
the
filth
and
hardship
of
her
ruined
life
overeating
and
dissoluteness
killed
her
according
to
the
lorilleuxs
one
morning
as
there
was
a
bad
smell
in
the
passage
it
was
remembered
that
she
had
not
been
seen
for
two
days
and
she
was
discovered
already
green
in
her
hole
it
happened
to
be
old
bazouge
who
came
with
the
pauper
coffin
under
his
arm
to
pack
her
up
he
was
again
precious
drunk
that
day
but
a
jolly
fellow
all
the
same
and
as
lively
as
a
cricket
when
he
recognized
the
customer
he
had
to
deal
with
he
uttered
several
philosophical
reflections
whilst
performing
his
little
business
everyone
has
to
go
there
no
occasion
for
jostling
there
room
for
everyone
and
it
stupid
being
in
a
hurry
that
just
slows
you
up
all
i
want
to
do
is
to
please
everybody
some
will
others
wo
the
result
here
one
who
would
then
she
would
so
she
was
made
to
wait
anyhow
it
all
right
now
and
faith
she
earned
it
merrily
just
take
it
easy
and
when
he
took
hold
of
gervaise
in
his
big
dirty
hands
he
was
seized
with
emotion
and
he
gently
raised
this
woman
who
had
had
so
great
a
longing
for
his
attentions
then
as
he
laid
her
out
with
paternal
care
at
the
bottom
of
the
coffin
he
stuttered
between
two
hiccoughs
you
know
now
listen
it
me
called
the
consoler
there
you
happy
now
go
my
beauty
the
end
