jerusalem
the
swedish
academy
in
recognizing
miss
selma
lagerlöf
declared
that
they
did
so
for
reason
of
the
noble
idealism
the
wealth
of
imagination
the
soulful
quality
of
style
which
characterize
her
works
five
years
later
in
that
august
body
elected
doctor
lagerlöf
into
their
fellowship
and
she
is
thus
the
only
woman
among
those
eighteen
immortals
what
is
the
secret
of
the
power
that
has
made
miss
lagerlöf
an
author
acknowledged
not
alone
as
a
classic
in
the
schools
but
also
as
the
most
popular
and
generally
beloved
writer
in
scandinavia
she
entered
swedish
literature
at
a
period
when
the
cold
gray
star
of
realism
was
in
the
ascendant
when
the
trenchant
pen
of
strindberg
had
swept
away
the
cobwebs
of
unreality
and
people
were
accustomed
to
plays
and
novels
almost
brutal
in
their
frankness
wrapped
in
the
mantle
of
a
romanticism
her
soul
filled
with
idealism
on
the
one
hand
she
transformed
the
crisp
actualities
of
human
experience
by
throwing
about
them
the
glamour
of
the
unknown
and
on
the
other
hand
gave
to
the
unreal
to
folk
tale
and
fairy
lore
and
local
superstition
the
effectiveness
of
convincing
fact
selma
lagerlöf
says
the
swedish
composer
hugo
alfvén
is
like
sitting
in
the
dusk
of
a
spanish
cathedral
afterward
one
does
not
know
whether
what
he
has
seen
was
dream
or
reality
but
certainly
he
has
been
on
holy
ground
the
average
mind
whether
swedish
or
soon
wearies
of
heartless
preciseness
in
literature
and
welcomes
an
idealism
as
wholesome
as
that
of
miss
lagerlöf
furthermore
the
swedish
authoress
attracts
her
readers
by
a
diction
unique
unto
herself
as
singular
as
the
english
sentences
of
charles
lamb
her
style
may
be
described
as
prose
rhapsody
held
in
restraint
at
times
passionately
breaking
its
bonds
miss
lagerlöf
has
not
been
without
her
share
of
life
perplexities
and
of
contact
with
her
fellowmen
it
is
by
intuition
that
she
rather
than
by
experience
otherwise
she
could
not
have
depicted
in
her
books
such
a
multitude
of
characters
from
all
parts
of
europe
she
sees
character
with
woman
warm
and
delicate
sympathy
and
with
the
clear
vision
of
childhood
selma
lagerlöf
declared
the
swedish
critic
oscar
levertin
has
the
eyes
of
a
child
and
the
heart
of
a
child
this
naïveté
is
responsible
for
the
simplicity
of
her
character
types
deep
and
sure
they
may
be
but
never
too
complex
for
the
reader
to
comprehend
the
more
varied
characters
as
the
critic
johan
mortensen
has
pointed
out
like
hellgum
the
mystic
in
jerusalem
are
merely
indicated
and
shadowy
how
unlike
ibsen
selma
lagerlöf
takes
her
delight
not
in
developing
the
psychology
of
the
unusual
but
in
analyzing
the
motives
and
emotions
of
the
normal
mind
this
accounts
for
the
comforting
feeling
of
satisfaction
and
familiarity
which
comes
over
one
reading
the
chronicles
of
events
so
exceptionable
as
those
which
occur
in
jerusalem
in
one
of
her
books
the
wonderful
adventures
of
nils
miss
lagerlöf
has
sketched
the
national
character
of
mart
swedish
people
in
reference
to
the
various
landscapes
visited
by
the
wild
goose
in
its
flight
in
another
romance
gösta
berling
she
has
interpreted
the
life
of
the
province
at
vermland
where
she
herself
was
born
on
a
farmstead
in
a
love
of
starlight
violins
and
dancing
a
temperament
easily
provoked
to
a
laughing
abandon
of
tragedy
characterizes
the
folk
of
vermland
and
the
impecunious
gentry
who
live
in
its
modest
manor
halls
it
is
a
different
folk
to
whom
one
is
introduced
in
jerusalem
the
people
of
dalecarlia
the
province
of
miss
lagerlöf
adopted
home
they
too
have
their
dancing
festivals
at
midsummer
eve
and
their
dress
is
the
most
gorgeous
in
sweden
but
one
thinks
of
them
rather
as
a
serious
and
solid
community
given
to
the
plow
and
conservative
habits
of
thought
they
were
good
catholics
once
now
they
are
stalwart
defenders
of
lutheranism
a
community
not
easily
persuaded
but
once
aroused
resolute
to
act
and
carry
through
to
the
uttermost
one
thinks
of
them
as
the
people
who
at
first
gave
a
deaf
ear
to
gustaf
vasa
appeal
to
drive
out
the
danes
but
who
eventually
followed
him
shoulder
to
shoulder
through
the
very
gates
of
stockholm
to
help
him
lay
the
foundations
of
modern
sweden
titles
of
nobility
have
never
prospered
in
dalecarlia
these
stalwart
landed
peasants
are
a
nobility
unto
themselves
the
swedish
people
regard
their
dalecarlians
as
a
reserve
upon
whom
to
draw
in
times
of
crisis
jerusalem
begins
with
the
history
of
a
wealthy
and
powerful
farmer
family
the
ingmarssons
of
ingmar
farm
and
develops
to
include
the
whole
parish
life
with
its
varied
farmer
types
its
pastor
schoolmaster
shopkeeper
and
innkeeper
the
romance
portrays
the
religious
revival
introduced
by
a
practical
mystic
from
chicago
which
leads
many
families
to
sell
their
ancestral
homesteads
and
in
the
last
chapter
of
this
volume
to
emigrate
in
a
body
to
the
holy
land
truth
is
stranger
than
fiction
jerusalem
is
founded
upon
the
historic
event
of
a
religious
pilgrimage
from
dalecarlia
in
the
last
century
the
writer
of
this
introduction
had
opportunity
to
confirm
this
fact
some
years
ago
when
he
visited
the
parish
in
question
and
saw
the
abandoned
farmsteads
as
well
as
homes
to
which
some
of
the
had
returned
and
more
than
this
i
had
an
experience
of
my
own
which
seemed
to
reflect
this
spirit
of
religious
ecstasy
on
my
way
to
the
inn
toward
midnight
i
met
a
cyclist
wearing
a
blue
jersey
and
on
the
breast
instead
of
a
college
letter
was
woven
a
yellow
cross
on
meeting
me
the
cyclist
dismounted
and
insisted
on
shouting
me
the
way
when
we
came
to
the
inn
i
offered
him
a
krona
my
guide
smiled
as
though
he
was
possessed
by
a
beatific
vision
no
i
will
not
take
the
money
but
the
gentleman
will
buy
my
bicycle
as
i
expressed
my
astonishment
at
this
request
he
smiled
again
confidently
and
replied
in
a
vision
last
night
the
lord
appeared
unto
me
and
said
that
i
should
meet
at
midnight
a
stranger
at
the
speaking
an
unknown
tongue
and
stranger
will
buy
thy
bicycle
the
novel
is
opened
by
that
favourite
device
of
selma
lagerlöf
the
monologue
through
which
she
pries
into
the
very
soul
of
her
characters
in
this
case
ingmar
son
of
ingmar
of
ingmar
farm
ingmar
monologue
at
the
plow
is
a
subtle
portrayal
of
an
heroic
battle
between
the
forces
of
conscience
and
desire
although
this
prelude
may
be
too
subjective
and
involved
to
be
readily
digested
by
readers
unfamiliar
with
the
swedish
author
method
they
will
soon
follow
with
intent
interest
into
those
pages
that
describe
how
ingmar
met
at
the
prison
door
the
girl
for
whose
infanticide
he
was
ethically
responsible
he
brings
her
back
apparently
to
face
disgrace
and
to
blot
the
fair
scutcheon
of
the
ingmarssons
but
actually
to
earn
the
respect
of
the
whole
community
voiced
in
the
declaration
of
the
dean
now
mother
martha
you
can
be
proud
of
ingmar
it
plain
now
he
belongs
to
the
old
stock
so
we
must
begin
to
call
him
ingmar
in
the
course
of
the
book
we
are
introduced
to
two
generations
of
ingmars
and
their
love
stories
are
quite
as
compelling
as
the
religious
motives
of
the
book
forever
unforgettable
is
the
scene
of
the
auction
where
ingmar
son
renounces
his
beloved
gertrude
and
betroths
himself
to
another
in
order
to
keep
the
old
estate
from
passing
out
of
the
hands
of
the
ingmars
thus
both
of
these
heroes
in
our
eyes
play
yellow
on
the
other
hand
they
have
our
sympathy
and
the
reader
is
tossed
about
by
the
alternate
undertow
of
the
strong
currents
which
control
the
conduct
of
this
farming
folk
sometimes
they
obey
only
their
own
unerring
instincts
as
in
that
vivid
situation
of
the
shy
departing
suitor
when
karin
ingmarsson
suddenly
breaks
through
convention
and
publicly
over
the
coffee
cups
declares
herself
betrothed
the
book
is
a
succession
of
these
brilliantly
portrayed
situations
that
clutch
at
the
heartstrings
the
meetings
in
the
mission
house
the
reconciliation
scene
when
ingmar
battered
watch
is
handed
to
the
man
he
felt
on
his
deathbed
he
had
wronged
the
dance
on
the
night
of
the
wild
hunt
the
shipwreck
gertrude
renunciation
of
her
lover
for
her
religion
the
brother
who
buys
the
old
farmstead
so
that
his
brother
wife
may
have
a
home
if
she
should
ever
return
from
the
holy
land
as
for
the
closing
pages
that
describe
the
departure
of
the
they
are
difficult
to
read
aloud
without
a
sob
and
a
lump
in
the
throat
the
underlying
spiritual
action
of
jerusalem
is
the
conflict
of
idealism
with
that
impulse
which
is
deep
rooted
in
the
rural
communities
of
the
old
world
the
love
of
home
and
the
home
soil
it
is
a
virtue
unfortunately
too
dimly
appreciated
in
restless
america
though
felt
in
some
measure
in
the
old
communities
of
massachusetts
and
virginia
and
quaker
homesteads
near
philadelphia
among
the
peasant
aristocracy
of
dalecarlia
attachment
to
the
homestead
is
life
itself
in
jerusalem
this
emotion
is
pitted
on
the
one
hand
against
religion
on
the
other
against
hearts
are
broken
in
the
struggle
permits
karin
to
sacrifice
the
ingmar
farm
to
obey
the
inner
voice
that
summons
her
on
her
religious
pilgrimage
and
leads
her
brother
on
the
other
hand
to
abandon
the
girl
of
his
heart
and
his
life
personal
happiness
in
order
to
win
back
the
farm
the
tragic
intensity
of
jerusalem
is
happily
relieved
by
the
undercurrent
of
miss
lagerlöf
sympathetic
humour
when
she
has
almost
succeeded
in
transporting
us
into
a
state
of
religious
fervour
we
suddenly
catch
her
smile
through
the
lines
and
realize
that
no
one
more
than
she
feels
the
futility
of
fanaticism
the
stupid
blunders
of
humankind
do
not
escape
her
neither
do
they
arouse
her
contempt
she
accepts
human
nature
as
it
is
with
a
warm
fondness
for
all
its
types
we
laugh
and
weep
simultaneously
at
the
children
of
the
departing
pilgrims
who
cry
out
in
vain
we
want
to
go
to
jerusalem
we
want
to
go
home
to
the
translator
of
jerusalem
velma
swanston
howard
author
and
reader
alike
must
feel
indebted
howard
has
already
received
generous
praise
for
her
translation
of
nils
and
other
works
of
selma
lagerlöf
although
born
in
sweden
she
has
achieved
remarkable
mastery
of
english
diction
as
a
friend
of
miss
lagerlöf
and
an
artist
she
is
enabled
herself
to
pass
through
the
temperament
of
creation
and
to
reproduce
the
original
in
essence
as
well
as
sufficient
verisimilitude
howard
is
no
mere
artisan
translator
she
goes
over
her
page
not
but
a
dozen
times
and
the
result
is
not
a
labored
performance
but
a
work
of
real
art
in
strong
and
confident
prose
henry
goddard
leach

june
book
one
the
ingmarssons
i
a
young
farmer
was
plowing
his
field
one
summer
morning
the
sun
shone
the
grass
sparkled
with
dew
and
the
air
was
so
light
and
bracing
that
no
words
can
describe
it
the
horses
were
frisky
from
the
morning
air
and
pulled
the
plow
along
as
if
in
play
they
were
going
at
a
pace
quite
different
from
their
usual
gait
the
man
had
fairly
to
run
to
keep
up
with
them
the
earth
as
it
was
turned
by
the
plow
lay
black
and
shone
with
moisture
and
fatness
and
the
man
at
the
plow
was
happy
in
the
thought
of
soon
being
able
to
sow
his
rye
why
is
it
that
i
feel
so
discouraged
at
times
and
think
life
so
hard
he
wondered
what
more
does
one
want
than
sunshine
and
fair
weather
to
be
as
happy
as
a
child
of
heaven
a
long
and
rather
broad
valley
with
stretches
of
green
and
yellow
grain
fields
with
mowed
clover
meadows
potato
patches
in
flower
and
little
fields
of
flax
with
their
tiny
blue
flowers
above
which
fluttered
great
swarms
of
white
butterflies
this
was
the
setting
at
the
very
heart
of
the
valley
as
if
to
complete
the
picture
lay
a
big
farmstead
with
many
gray
outhouses
and
a
large
red
at
the
gables
stood
two
tall
spreading
pear
trees
at
the
gate
were
a
couple
of
young
birches
in
the
yard
were
great
piles
of
firewood
and
behind
the
barn
were
several
huge
haystacks
the
farmhouse
rising
above
the
low
fields
was
as
pretty
a
sight
as
a
ship
with
masts
and
sails
towering
above
the
broad
surface
of
the
sea
the
man
at
the
plow
was
thinking
what
a
farm
you
got
many
houses
fine
cattle
and
horses
and
servants
who
are
as
good
as
gold
at
least
you
are
as
as
any
one
in
these
parts
so
you
never
have
to
face
poverty
but
it
not
poverty
that
i
fear
he
said
as
if
in
answer
to
his
own
thought
i
should
be
satisfied
were
i
only
as
good
a
man
as
my
father
or
my
father
father
what
could
have
put
such
silly
nonsense
into
your
head
he
wondered
and
a
moment
ago
you
were
feeling
so
happy
ponder
well
this
one
thing
in
father
time
all
the
neighbours
were
guided
by
him
in
all
their
undertakings
the
morning
he
began
haymaking
they
did
likewise
and
the
day
we
started
in
to
plow
our
fallow
field
at
the
ingmar
farm
plows
were
put
in
the
earth
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
valley
yet
here
i
been
plowing
now
for
two
hours
and
more
without
any
one
having
so
much
as
ground
a
plowshare
i
believe
i
have
managed
this
farm
as
well
as
any
one
who
has
borne
the
name
of
ingmar
ingmarsson
he
mused
i
can
get
more
for
my
hay
than
father
ever
got
for
his
and
i
not
satisfied
to
let
the
ditches
which
crossed
the
farm
in
his
time
remain
what
more
no
one
can
say
that
i
misuse
the
woodlands
as
he
did
by
converting
them
into
land
there
are
times
when
all
this
seems
hard
to
bear
said
the
young
man
i
ca
always
take
it
as
lightly
as
i
do
when
father
and
grandfather
lived
folks
used
to
say
that
the
ingmarssons
had
been
on
earth
such
a
long
time
that
they
must
know
what
was
pleasing
to
our
lord
therefore
the
people
fairly
begged
them
to
rule
over
the
parish
they
appointed
both
parson
and
sexton
they
determined
when
the
river
should
be
dredged
and
where
gaols
should
be
built
but
me
no
one
consults
nor
have
i
a
say
in
anything
it
wonderful
all
the
same
that
troubles
can
be
so
easily
borne
on
a
morning
like
this
i
could
almost
laugh
at
them
and
still
i
fear
that
matters
will
be
worse
than
ever
for
me
in
the
fall
if
i
should
do
what
i
now
thinking
of
doing
neither
the
parson
nor
the
judge
will
shake
hands
with
me
when
we
meet
at
the
church
on
a
sunday
which
is
something
they
have
always
done
up
to
the
present
i
could
never
hope
to
be
made
a
guardian
of
the
poor
nor
could
i
even
think
of
becoming
a
churchwarden
thinking
is
never
so
easy
as
when
one
follows
a
plow
up
a
furrow
and
down
a
furrow
you
are
quite
alone
and
there
is
nothing
to
distract
you
but
the
crows
hopping
about
picking
up
worms
the
thoughts
seemed
to
come
to
the
man
as
readily
as
if
some
one
had
whispered
them
into
his
ear
only
on
rare
occasions
had
he
been
able
to
think
as
quickly
and
clearly
as
on
that
day
and
the
thought
of
it
gladdened
and
encouraged
him
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
giving
himself
needless
anxiety
that
no
one
expected
him
to
plunge
headlong
into
misery
he
thought
that
if
his
father
were
only
living
now
he
would
ask
his
advice
in
this
matter
as
he
had
always
done
in
the
old
days
when
grave
questions
had
come
up
if
i
only
knew
the
way
i
go
to
him
he
said
quite
pleased
at
the
idea
i
wonder
what
big
ingmar
would
say
if
some
fine
day
i
should
come
wandering
up
to
him
i
fancy
him
settled
on
a
big
farm
with
many
fields
and
meadows
a
large
house
and
barns
galore
with
lots
of
red
cattle
and
not
a
black
or
spotted
beast
among
them
just
exactly
as
he
wanted
it
when
he
was
on
earth
then
as
i
step
into
the
farmhouse
the
plowman
suddenly
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
furrow
and
glanced
up
laughing
these
thoughts
seemed
to
amuse
him
greatly
and
he
was
so
carried
away
by
them
that
he
hardly
knew
whether
or
not
he
was
still
upon
earth
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
a
twinkling
he
had
been
lifted
all
the
way
up
to
his
old
father
in
heaven
and
now
as
i
come
into
the
he
went
on
i
see
many
peasants
seated
on
benches
along
the
walls
all
have
sandy
hair
white
eyebrows
and
thick
underlips
they
are
all
of
them
as
like
father
as
one
pea
is
like
another
at
the
sight
of
so
many
people
i
become
shy
and
linger
at
the
door
father
sits
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
the
instant
he
sees
me
he
says
little
ingmar
ingmarsson
then
father
gets
up
and
comes
over
to
me
like
to
have
a
word
with
you
father
i
say
there
are
so
many
strangers
here
these
are
only
relatives
says
father
these
men
have
lived
at
the
ingmar
farm
and
the
oldest
among
them
is
from
way
back
in
heathen
times
i
want
to
speak
to
you
in
private
i
say
then
father
looks
round
and
wonders
whether
he
ought
to
step
into
the
next
room
but
since
it
just
i
he
walks
out
into
the
kitchen
instead
there
he
seats
himself
in
the
fireplace
while
i
sit
down
on
the
chopping
block
got
a
fine
farm
here
father
i
say
not
so
bad
says
father
how
everything
back
home
everything
is
all
right
there
last
year
we
got
twelve
kroner
for
a
ton
of
hay
says
father
you
here
to
poke
fun
at
me
little
ingmar
with
me
everything
goes
wrong
i
say
forever
telling
me
that
you
were
as
wise
as
our
lord
himself
but
no
one
cares
a
straw
for
me
you
one
of
the
district
councillors
the
old
man
asks
not
on
the
school
board
or
in
the
vestry
nor
am
i
a
councillor
have
you
done
that
wrong
little
ingmar
they
say
that
he
who
would
direct
the
affairs
of
others
first
show
that
he
can
manage
his
own
properly
then
i
seem
to
see
the
old
man
lower
his
eyes
and
sit
pondering
in
a
little
while
he
says
you
ought
to
marry
some
nice
girl
who
will
make
you
a
good
wife
that
exactly
what
i
ca
do
father
i
reply
is
not
a
farmer
in
the
parish
even
among
the
poor
and
lowly
who
would
give
me
his
daughter
tell
me
straight
out
what
back
of
all
this
little
ingmar
says
father
with
such
a
tender
note
in
his
voice
you
see
father
four
years
ago
the
same
year
that
i
took
over
the
farm
i
was
courting
brita
of
bergskog
me
see
says
father
any
of
our
folks
live
at
bergskog
he
seems
to
have
lost
all
remembrance
of
how
things
are
down
on
earth
but
they
are
people
and
you
must
surely
remember
that
brita
father
is
a
member
of
parliament
of
course
but
you
should
have
married
one
of
our
people
then
you
would
have
had
a
wife
who
knew
about
our
old
customs
and
habits
right
father
and
i
was
long
finding
that
out
now
both
father
and
i
are
silent
a
moment
then
the
old
man
continues
was
of
course
i
reply
had
dark
hair
and
bright
eyes
and
rosy
cheeks
and
she
was
clever
too
so
that
mother
was
pleased
with
my
choice
all
might
have
turned
out
well
but
you
see
the
mistake
of
it
was
that
she
want
me
of
no
consequence
what
such
a
slip
of
a
girl
wants
or
does
want
her
parents
forced
her
to
say
yes
do
you
know
she
was
forced
it
my
candid
opinion
that
she
was
glad
to
get
a
rich
husband
like
you
ingmar
ingmarsson
no
she
was
anything
but
glad
all
the
same
the
banns
were
published
and
the
wedding
day
was
fixed
so
brita
came
down
to
the
ingmar
farm
to
help
mother
i
say
mother
is
getting
old
and
feeble
see
nothing
wrong
in
all
that
little
ingmar
says
father
as
if
to
cheer
me
up
that
year
nothing
seemed
to
thrive
on
the
farm
the
potato
crop
was
a
failure
and
the
cows
got
sick
so
mother
i
decided
it
was
best
to
put
off
the
wedding
a
year
you
see
i
thought
it
did
matter
so
much
about
the
wedding
as
long
as
the
banns
had
been
read
but
perhaps
it
was
to
think
that
way
you
chosen
one
of
our
kind
she
would
have
exercised
patience
says
father
yes
i
say
could
see
that
brita
did
like
the
idea
of
a
postponement
but
you
see
i
felt
that
i
could
afford
a
wedding
just
then
there
had
been
the
funeral
in
the
spring
and
we
did
want
to
take
the
money
out
of
the
bank
did
quite
right
in
waiting
says
father
i
was
a
little
afraid
that
brita
would
not
care
to
have
the
christening
come
before
the
wedding
must
first
make
sure
that
one
has
the
means
says
father
day
brita
became
more
and
more
quiet
and
strange
i
used
to
wonder
what
was
wrong
with
her
and
fancied
she
was
homesick
for
she
had
always
loved
her
home
and
her
parents
this
will
blow
over
i
thought
when
she
gets
used
to
us
she
soon
feel
at
home
on
the
ingmar
farm
i
put
up
with
it
for
a
time
then
one
day
i
asked
mother
why
brita
was
looking
so
pale
and
wild
eyed
mother
said
it
was
because
she
was
with
child
and
she
would
surely
be
her
old
self
again
once
that
was
over
with
i
had
a
faint
suspicion
that
brita
was
brooding
over
my
putting
off
the
wedding
but
i
was
afraid
to
ask
her
about
it
you
know
father
you
always
said
that
the
year
i
married
the
house
was
to
have
a
fresh
coat
of
red
paint
that
year
i
simply
could
afford
it
by
next
year
everything
will
be
all
right
i
thought
then
the
plowman
walked
along
his
lips
moving
all
the
while
he
actually
imagined
that
he
saw
before
him
the
face
of
his
father
i
shall
have
to
lay
the
whole
case
before
the
old
man
frankly
and
clearly
he
remarked
to
himself
so
he
can
advise
me
had
come
and
gone
yet
nothing
was
changed
i
felt
at
times
that
if
brita
were
to
keep
on
being
unhappy
i
might
better
give
her
up
and
send
her
home
however
it
was
too
late
to
think
of
that
then
one
evening
early
in
may
we
discovered
that
she
had
quietly
slipped
away
we
searched
for
her
all
through
the
night
and
in
the
morning
one
of
the
housemaids
found
her
i
find
it
hard
now
to
continue
and
take
refuge
in
silence
then
father
exclaims
god
name
she
was
dead
was
she
not
she
i
say
and
father
notes
the
tremor
in
my
voice
the
child
born
asks
father
i
reply
she
had
strangled
it
it
was
lying
dead
beside
her
she
could
have
been
in
her
right
mind
she
knew
well
enough
what
she
vas
about
i
say
did
it
to
get
even
with
me
for
forcing
myself
upon
her
still
she
would
never
have
done
this
thing
had
i
married
her
she
said
she
had
been
thinking
that
since
i
did
not
want
my
child
honourably
born
i
should
have
no
child
father
is
dumb
with
grief
but
by
and
by
he
says
to
me
you
have
been
glad
of
the
child
little
ingmar
i
answer
boy
it
a
shame
that
you
should
have
fallen
in
with
a
bad
woman
she
is
in
prison
of
course
says
father
was
sent
up
for
three
years
it
because
of
this
that
no
man
will
let
you
marry
a
daughter
of
his
but
i
have
asked
anyone
either
this
is
why
you
have
no
standing
in
the
parish
all
think
it
ought
not
to
have
gone
that
way
for
brita
folks
say
that
if
i
had
been
a
sensible
man
like
yourself
i
would
have
talked
to
her
and
found
out
what
was
troubling
her
not
so
easy
for
a
man
to
understand
a
bad
woman
says
father
father
brita
was
not
bad
but
she
was
a
proud
one
comes
to
the
same
thing
says
father
now
that
father
seems
to
side
with
me
i
say
are
many
who
think
i
should
have
managed
it
in
such
a
way
that
no
one
would
have
known
but
that
the
child
was
born
dead
should
she
take
her
punishment
says
father
say
if
this
had
happened
in
your
time
you
would
have
made
the
servant
who
found
her
keep
her
tongue
in
her
head
so
that
nothing
could
have
leaked
out
in
that
case
would
you
have
married
her
then
there
would
have
been
no
need
of
my
marrying
her
i
would
have
sent
her
back
to
her
parents
in
a
week
or
so
and
the
banns
annulled
on
the
grounds
that
she
was
not
happy
with
us
all
very
well
but
no
one
can
expect
a
young
chap
like
you
to
have
an
old
man
head
on
him
whole
parish
thinks
that
i
behaved
badly
toward
brita
has
done
worse
in
bringing
disgrace
upon
honest
folk
i
made
her
take
me
ought
to
be
mighty
glad
of
it
says
father
father
do
you
think
it
is
my
fault
her
being
in
prison
put
herself
there
i
thinking
then
i
get
up
and
say
very
slowly
you
do
think
father
that
i
have
to
do
anything
for
her
when
she
comes
out
in
the
fall
should
you
do
marry
her
just
what
i
ought
to
do
father
looks
at
me
a
moment
then
asks
you
love
her
she
has
killed
my
love
father
closes
his
eyes
and
begins
to
meditate
see
father
i
ca
get
away
from
this
that
i
have
brought
misfortune
upon
some
one
the
old
man
sits
quite
still
and
does
not
answer
last
time
i
saw
her
was
in
the
courtroom
then
she
was
so
gentle
and
longed
so
for
her
child
not
one
harsh
word
did
she
say
against
me
she
took
all
the
blame
to
herself
many
in
that
courtroom
were
moved
to
tears
and
the
judge
himself
had
to
swallow
hard
he
did
give
her
more
than
three
years
either
but
father
does
not
say
a
word
will
be
hard
for
her
when
fall
comes
and
she
sent
home
they
wo
be
glad
to
have
her
again
at
bergskog
her
folks
all
feel
that
she
has
brought
shame
upon
them
and
they
pretty
sure
to
let
her
know
it
too
there
will
be
nothing
for
her
but
to
sit
at
home
all
the
while
she
wo
even
dare
to
go
to
church
going
to
be
hard
for
her
in
every
way
but
father
does
answer
is
not
such
an
easy
thing
for
me
to
marry
her
to
have
a
wife
that
menservants
and
maidservants
will
look
down
upon
is
not
a
pleasant
prospect
for
a
man
with
a
big
farmstead
nor
would
mother
like
it
we
never
invite
people
to
the
house
either
to
weddings
or
funerals
meanwhile
not
a
word
out
of
father
of
course
at
the
trial
i
tried
to
help
her
as
much
as
i
could
i
told
the
judge
that
i
was
entirely
to
blame
as
i
took
the
girl
against
her
will
i
also
said
that
i
considered
her
so
innocent
of
any
wrong
that
i
would
marry
her
then
and
there
if
she
could
only
think
better
of
me
i
said
that
so
the
judge
would
give
her
a
lighter
sentence
although
i
had
two
letters
from
her
nothing
in
them
to
show
any
changed
feeling
toward
me
so
you
see
father
i
not
obliged
to
marry
her
because
of
that
speech
father
sits
and
ponders
but
he
does
speak
know
that
this
is
simply
looking
at
the
thing
from
the
viewpoint
of
men
and
we
ingmars
have
always
wanted
to
stand
well
in
the
sight
of
god
and
yet
sometimes
i
think
that
maybe
our
lord
would
like
it
if
we
honoured
a
murderess
and
father
does
utter
a
sound
father
how
one
must
feel
who
lets
another
suffer
without
giving
a
helping
hand
i
have
passed
through
too
much
these
last
few
years
not
to
try
to
do
something
for
her
when
she
gets
out
father
sits
there
immovable
now
i
can
hardly
keep
back
the
tears
see
father
i
a
young
man
and
will
lose
much
if
i
marry
her
every
one
seems
to
think
i
already
made
a
mess
of
my
life
they
will
think
still
worse
of
me
after
this
but
i
ca
make
father
say
a
word
have
often
wondered
why
it
is
that
we
ingmars
have
been
allowed
to
remain
on
our
farm
for
hundreds
of
years
while
the
other
farms
have
all
changed
hands
and
the
thought
comes
to
me
that
it
may
be
because
the
ingmars
have
always
tried
to
walk
in
the
ways
of
god
we
ingmars
need
not
fear
man
we
have
only
to
walk
in
god
ways
then
the
old
man
looks
up
and
says
is
a
difficult
problem
my
son
i
guess
i
go
in
and
talk
it
over
with
the
other
ingmarssons
so
father
goes
back
to
the
while
i
remain
in
the
kitchen
there
i
sit
waiting
and
waiting
but
father
does
not
return
then
after
hours
and
hours
of
this
i
get
cross
and
go
to
him
must
have
patience
little
ingmar
says
father
is
a
difficult
question
and
i
see
all
the
old
yeomen
sitting
there
with
closed
eyes
deep
in
thought
so
i
wait
and
wait
and
for
aught
i
know
must
go
on
waiting
smiling
he
followed
the
plow
which
was
now
moving
along
very
slowly
as
if
the
horses
were
tired
out
and
could
scarcely
drag
it
when
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
furrow
he
pulled
up
the
plow
and
rested
he
had
become
very
serious
strange
when
you
ask
anyone
advice
you
see
yourself
what
is
right
even
while
you
are
asking
you
discover
all
at
once
what
you
had
been
able
to
find
out
in
three
whole
years
now
it
shall
be
as
god
wills
he
felt
that
this
thing
must
be
done
but
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
so
hard
to
him
that
the
mere
thought
of
it
took
away
his
courage
help
me
lord
he
said
ingmar
ingmarsson
was
however
not
the
only
person
abroad
at
that
hour
an
old
man
came
trudging
along
the
winding
path
that
crossed
the
fields
it
was
not
difficult
to
guess
his
occupation
for
he
carried
on
his
shoulder
a
paint
brush
and
was
spattered
with
red
paint
from
his
cap
to
his
shoe
tips
he
kept
glancing
after
the
manner
of
journeymen
painters
to
find
an
unpainted
farmhouse
or
one
that
needed
repainting
he
had
seen
here
and
there
one
and
another
which
he
thought
might
answer
his
purpose
but
he
could
not
seem
to
fix
upon
any
special
one
then
finally
from
the
top
of
a
hillock
he
caught
sight
of
the
big
ingmar
farm
down
in
the
valley
great
caesar
he
exclaimed
and
stopped
short
that
farmhouse
has
been
painted
in
a
hundred
years
why
it
black
with
age
and
the
barns
have
never
seen
a
drop
of
point
here
there
work
enough
to
keep
me
busy
till
fall
a
little
farther
on
he
came
upon
a
man
plowing
why
there
a
farmer
who
belongs
here
and
knows
all
about
this
neighbourhood
thought
the
painter
he
can
tell
me
all
i
need
know
about
that
homestead
yonder
whereupon
he
crossed
the
path
into
the
field
stepped
up
to
ingmar
and
asked
him
if
he
thought
the
folks
living
over
there
wanted
any
painting
done
ingmar
ingmarsson
was
startled
and
stood
staring
at
the
man
as
though
he
were
a
ghost
lord
as
i
live
it
a
painter
he
remarked
to
himself
and
to
think
of
his
coming
just
now
he
was
so
dumbfounded
that
he
could
not
answer
the
man
he
distinctly
recalled
that
every
time
any
one
had
said
to
his
father
you
ought
to
have
that
big
ugly
house
of
yours
painted
father
ingmar
the
old
man
had
always
replied
that
he
would
have
it
done
the
year
ingmar
married
the
painter
put
the
question
a
second
time
and
a
third
but
ingmar
stood
there
dazed
as
if
he
had
not
understood
him
are
they
ready
at
last
with
their
answer
he
wondered
is
this
a
message
from
father
to
say
that
he
wishes
me
to
marry
this
year
he
was
so
overwhelmed
by
the
thought
that
he
hired
the
man
on
the
spot
then
he
went
on
with
his
plowing
deeply
moved
and
almost
happy
you
see
it
wo
be
so
very
hard
to
do
this
now
that
you
know
for
certain
it
is
father
wish
he
said
ii
a
fortnight
later
ingmar
ingmarsson
stood
polishing
some
harness
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
bad
humour
and
found
the
work
rather
irksome
were
i
in
our
lord
place
he
thought
then
put
in
another
rub
or
two
and
beg
again
were
i
in
our
lord
place
i
see
to
it
that
a
thing
was
done
the
instant
your
mind
was
made
up
i
should
allow
folks
such
a
long
time
to
think
it
over
and
ponder
all
the
obstacles
i
should
give
them
time
to
polish
harness
and
paint
wagons
i
take
them
straight
from
the
plow
he
caught
the
sound
of
wagon
wheels
from
the
road
and
looked
out
he
knew
at
once
whose
rig
it
was
the
senator
from
bergskog
is
coming
he
shouted
into
the
kitchen
where
his
mother
was
at
work
instantly
fresh
wood
was
laid
on
the
fire
and
the
coffee
mill
was
set
going
the
senator
drove
into
the
yard
where
he
pulled
up
without
alighting
no
i
not
going
into
the
house
he
said
i
only
want
a
word
or
two
with
you
ingmar
i
rather
pressed
for
time
as
i
am
due
at
the
parish
meeting
mother
is
just
making
some
fresh
coffee
said
ingmar
thank
you
but
i
must
not
be
late
it
a
good
while
now
since
you
were
here
senator
said
ingmar
pressingly
then
ingmar
mother
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
protested
surely
you
not
thinking
of
going
without
first
coming
in
for
a
drop
of
coffee
ingmar
unbuttoned
the
carriage
apron
and
the
senator
began
to
move
seeing
it
mother
martha
herself
that
commands
me
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
obey
he
said
the
senator
was
a
tall
man
of
striking
appearance
with
a
certain
ease
of
manner
he
was
of
a
totally
different
stamp
from
ingmar
or
his
mother
who
were
very
plain
looking
with
sleepy
faces
and
clumsy
bodies
but
all
the
same
the
senator
had
a
profound
respect
for
the
old
family
of
ingmars
and
would
gladly
have
sacrificed
his
own
active
exterior
to
be
like
ingmar
and
to
become
one
of
the
ingmassons
he
had
always
taken
ingmar
part
against
his
own
daughter
so
felt
rather
light
of
heart
at
being
so
well
received
in
a
while
when
mother
martha
had
brought
the
coffee
he
began
to
state
his
errand
i
thought
he
said
and
cleared
his
throat
i
thought
you
had
best
be
told
what
we
intend
to
do
with
brita
the
cup
which
mother
martha
held
in
her
hand
shook
a
little
and
the
teaspoon
rattled
in
the
saucer
then
there
was
a
painful
silence
we
have
been
thinking
that
the
best
thing
we
could
do
would
be
to
send
her
to
america
he
made
another
pause
only
to
be
met
by
the
same
ominous
silence
he
sighed
at
the
thought
of
these
unresponsive
people
her
ticket
has
already
been
purchased
she
will
come
home
first
of
course
said
ingmar
no
what
would
she
be
doing
there
again
ingmar
was
silent
he
sat
with
his
eyes
nearly
closed
as
if
he
were
half
asleep
then
mother
martha
took
a
turn
at
asking
questions
she
be
needing
clothes
wo
she
all
that
has
been
attended
to
there
is
a
trunk
ready
packed
at
lövberg
place
where
we
always
stop
when
we
come
to
town
her
mother
will
be
there
to
meet
her
i
suppose
well
no
she
would
like
to
but
i
think
it
best
that
they
be
spared
a
meeting
maybe
so
the
ticket
and
some
money
are
waiting
for
her
at
lövberg
so
that
she
will
have
everything
she
needs
i
felt
that
ingmar
ought
to
know
of
it
so
he
wo
have
this
burden
on
his
mind
any
longer
said
the
senator
then
mother
martha
kept
still
too
her
headkerchief
had
slipped
back
and
she
sat
gazing
down
at
her
apron
ingmar
should
be
looking
about
for
a
new
wife
both
mother
and
son
persistently
held
their
peace
mother
martha
needs
a
helper
in
this
big
household
ingmar
should
see
to
it
that
she
has
some
comfort
in
her
old
age
the
senator
paused
a
moment
wondering
if
they
could
have
heard
what
he
said
my
wife
and
i
wanted
to
make
everything
right
again
he
declared
finally
in
the
meantime
a
sense
of
great
relief
had
come
to
ingmar
brita
was
going
to
america
and
he
would
not
have
to
marry
her
after
all
a
murderess
was
not
to
become
the
mistress
of
the
old
ingmar
home
he
had
kept
still
thinking
it
was
not
the
thing
to
show
at
once
how
pleased
he
was
but
now
he
began
to
feel
that
it
would
be
only
right
and
proper
for
him
to
say
something
the
senator
quietly
bided
his
time
he
knew
that
he
had
to
give
these
people
time
to
consider
presently
mother
said
brita
has
paid
her
penalty
now
it
our
turn
by
this
the
old
woman
meant
that
if
the
senator
wanted
any
help
from
the
ingmarssons
in
return
for
his
having
smoothed
the
way
for
them
they
would
not
withhold
it
but
ingmar
interpreted
her
utterance
differently
he
gave
a
start
as
if
suddenly
awakened
from
sleep
what
would
father
say
of
this
he
wondered
if
i
were
to
lay
the
whole
matter
before
him
what
would
he
be
likely
to
say
must
not
think
that
you
can
make
a
mockery
of
god
judgment
he
would
say
do
imagine
that
he
will
let
it
go
unpunished
if
you
allow
brita
to
shoulder
all
the
blame
if
her
father
wants
to
cast
her
off
just
to
get
into
your
good
graces
so
that
he
can
borrow
money
from
you
you
must
nevertheless
follow
god
leading
little
ingmar
ingmarsson
i
verily
believe
the
old
man
is
keeping
close
watch
of
me
in
this
matter
he
thought
he
must
have
sent
brita
father
here
to
show
me
how
mean
it
is
to
try
to
shift
everything
on
to
her
poor
girl
i
guess
he
must
have
noticed
that
i
have
had
any
great
desire
to
take
that
journey
these
last
few
days
ingmar
got
up
poured
some
brandy
into
his
coffee
and
raised
the
cup
here
a
thank
you
to
the
senator
for
coming
here
he
said
and
clinked
cups
with
him
iii
ingmar
had
been
busy
all
the
morning
working
around
the
birches
down
by
the
gate
first
he
had
put
up
a
scaffolding
then
he
had
bent
the
tops
of
the
trees
toward
each
other
so
that
they
formed
an
arch
what
all
that
for
asked
mother
martha
oh
it
suits
my
fancy
to
have
them
grow
that
way
for
a
change
said
ingmar
along
came
the
noon
hour
and
the
men
folks
stopped
their
work
after
the
midday
meal
the
farm
hands
went
out
into
the
yard
and
lay
down
in
the
grass
to
sleep
ingmar
ingmarsson
slept
too
but
he
was
lying
in
a
broad
bed
in
the
chamber
off
the
the
only
person
not
asleep
was
the
old
mistress
who
sat
in
the
big
room
knitting
the
door
to
the
entrance
hall
was
cautiously
opened
and
in
came
an
old
woman
carrying
two
large
baskets
on
a
yoke
after
passing
the
time
of
day
she
sat
down
on
a
chair
by
the
door
and
took
the
lids
off
the
baskets
one
of
which
was
filled
with
rusks
and
buns
the
other
with
newly
baked
loaves
of
spiced
bread
the
housewife
at
once
went
over
to
the
old
woman
and
began
to
bargain
ordinarily
she
kept
a
tight
fist
on
the
pennies
but
she
never
could
resist
a
temptation
to
indulge
her
weakness
for
sweets
to
dip
in
her
coffee
while
selecting
her
cakes
she
began
to
chat
with
the
old
woman
who
like
most
persons
that
go
from
place
to
place
and
know
many
people
was
a
ready
talker
kaisa
you
a
sensible
person
said
mother
martha
and
one
can
rely
on
you
yes
indeed
said
the
other
if
i
did
know
enough
to
keep
mum
about
most
of
the
things
i
hear
there
be
some
fine
matches
i
thinking
but
sometimes
you
are
altogether
too
kaisa
the
old
woman
looked
up
the
inference
was
quite
plain
to
her
may
the
lord
forgive
me
she
said
tearfully
but
i
talked
to
the
senator
wife
at
bergskog
when
i
should
have
come
straight
to
you
so
you
have
been
talking
to
the
senator
wife
and
the
emphasis
given
to
the
last
two
words
spoke
volumes
ingmar
had
been
startled
from
his
sleep
by
the
opening
of
the
outside
door
no
one
had
come
in
apparently
still
the
door
stood
ajar
he
did
not
know
whether
it
had
sprung
open
or
whether
some
one
had
opened
it
too
sleepy
to
get
up
he
settled
back
in
bed
and
then
he
heard
talking
in
the
outer
room
now
tell
me
kaisa
what
makes
you
think
that
brita
does
care
for
ingmar
from
the
very
start
folks
have
been
saying
that
her
parents
made
her
take
him
returned
the
old
woman
evasively
speak
right
out
kaisa
for
when
i
question
you
you
do
have
to
beat
about
the
bush
i
guess
i
able
to
bear
anything
you
may
have
to
tell
me
i
must
say
that
every
time
i
was
at
bergskog
brit
always
looked
as
if
she
been
crying
once
when
she
and
i
were
alone
in
the
kitchen
i
said
to
her
a
fine
husband
you
be
getting
brita
she
looked
at
me
as
if
she
thought
i
was
making
fun
of
her
then
she
came
at
me
with
this
may
well
say
it
kaisa
fine
indeed
she
said
it
in
such
a
way
that
i
seemed
to
see
ingmar
ingmarsson
standing
there
before
my
face
and
eyes
and
he
no
beauty
as
i
always
had
a
great
respect
for
all
the
ingmarssons
that
thought
had
never
before
entered
my
mind
i
could
help
smiling
a
little
then
brita
gave
me
a
look
and
said
once
more
indeed
with
that
she
turned
on
her
heel
and
ran
into
her
room
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
as
i
was
leaving
i
said
to
myself
will
all
come
out
right
everything
always
comes
out
right
for
the
ingmarssons
i
did
wonder
at
her
parents
doing
what
they
did
if
ingmar
ingmarsson
had
proposed
to
a
daughter
of
mine
i
should
have
given
myself
a
moment
peace
till
she
said
yes
ingmar
from
his
bedroom
could
hear
every
word
that
was
spoken
mother
is
doing
this
on
purpose
he
thought
she
been
wondering
about
that
trip
to
town
mother
fancies
going
after
brita
to
fetch
her
home
she
does
suspect
that
too
big
a
coward
to
do
it
the
next
time
i
saw
brita
the
old
woman
went
on
was
after
she
had
come
here
to
you
i
could
ask
her
just
then
how
she
liked
it
here
seeing
the
house
was
full
of
visitors
but
when
i
had
gone
a
ways
into
the
grove
she
came
running
after
me
she
called
you
been
up
at
bergskog
lately
was
there
day
before
yesterday
i
replied
me
were
you
there
day
before
yesterday
and
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
at
home
in
years
it
was
easy
to
know
just
what
to
say
to
her
for
she
looked
as
if
she
could
bear
the
least
little
thing
and
would
be
ready
to
cry
at
whatever
i
might
say
can
surely
go
home
for
a
visit
i
said
i
think
i
shall
ever
go
home
again
do
go
i
urged
beautiful
up
there
now
the
woods
are
full
of
berries
the
bushes
are
thick
with
red
whortleberries
me
she
said
her
eyes
growing
big
with
surprise
there
whortleberries
already
indeed
surely
you
can
get
off
a
day
just
to
go
home
and
eat
your
fill
of
berries
i
hardly
think
i
want
to
she
said
going
home
would
make
it
all
the
harder
to
come
back
to
this
place
always
heard
that
the
ingmars
are
the
best
kind
of
folks
to
be
with
i
told
her
are
honest
people
yes
she
said
are
good
in
their
way
are
the
best
people
in
the
parish
i
said
so
is
not
considered
unfair
then
to
take
a
wife
by
force
are
also
very
wise
they
keep
all
they
know
to
themselves
they
never
say
anything
one
ever
says
a
word
more
than
what
is
absolutely
necessary
i
was
just
about
to
go
my
way
when
it
came
to
me
to
ask
her
where
the
wedding
was
going
to
be
held
here
or
at
her
home
thinking
of
having
it
here
where
there
is
plenty
of
room
see
to
it
that
the
wedding
day
is
put
off
too
long
i
warned
are
to
be
married
in
a
month
she
answered
but
before
brita
and
i
parted
company
it
struck
me
that
the
ingmarssons
had
had
a
poor
harvest
so
i
said
it
was
not
likely
that
they
would
have
a
wedding
that
year
that
case
i
shall
have
to
jump
into
the
river
she
declared
a
month
later
i
was
told
that
the
wedding
had
been
put
off
and
fearing
that
this
would
not
end
well
i
went
straight
to
bergskog
and
had
a
talk
with
brita
mother
are
certainly
making
a
stupid
blunder
down
at
the
ingmar
farm
i
told
her
are
satisfied
with
their
way
of
doing
things
she
said
day
we
thank
god
that
our
daughter
has
been
so
well
provided
for
mother
need
have
given
herself
all
this
bother
ingmar
was
thinking
for
no
one
from
this
farm
is
going
to
fetch
brita
there
was
no
reason
for
her
being
so
upset
at
the
sight
of
the
arch
that
is
only
one
of
those
things
a
man
does
so
that
he
can
turn
to
our
lord
and
say
wanted
to
do
it
surely
you
must
see
that
i
meant
to
do
it
but
doing
it
is
another
matter
the
last
time
i
saw
brita
kaisa
vent
on
was
in
the
middle
of
the
winter
after
a
big
snowfall
i
had
come
to
a
narrow
path
in
the
wild
forest
where
it
was
heavy
walking
soon
i
came
upon
some
one
who
was
sitting
in
the
snow
resting
it
was
brita
you
all
by
yourself
up
here
i
asked
i
out
for
a
walk
she
said
i
stood
stockstill
and
stared
at
her
i
could
imagine
what
she
was
doing
there
looking
round
to
see
if
there
are
any
steep
hills
hereabout
she
then
said
heart
are
you
thinking
of
casting
yourself
from
a
cliff
i
gasped
for
she
looked
as
if
she
was
tired
of
life
she
said
i
could
only
find
a
hill
that
was
high
and
steep
i
certainly
throw
myself
down
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
talk
like
that
and
you
so
well
cared
for
see
kaisa
i
a
bad
lot
afraid
you
are
am
likely
to
do
something
dreadful
therefore
i
might
better
be
dead
only
silly
gabble
child
turned
bad
as
soon
as
i
went
to
live
with
those
people
then
coming
quite
close
to
me
with
the
wildest
look
in
her
eyes
she
shrieked
they
think
about
is
how
they
can
torture
me
and
i
think
only
of
how
i
can
torture
them
in
return
no
brita
they
are
good
people
they
care
about
is
to
bring
shame
upon
me
you
said
so
to
them
never
speak
to
them
i
only
think
and
wonder
how
i
going
to
get
even
with
them
i
thinking
of
setting
fire
to
the
farm
for
i
know
he
loves
it
how
i
like
to
poison
the
cows
they
are
so
old
and
ugly
and
white
around
the
eyes
that
one
would
think
they
were
related
to
him
dogs
never
bite
i
said
got
to
do
something
to
him
or
i
never
have
any
peace
of
mind
do
know
what
you
are
saying
child
i
protested
you
are
thinking
of
doing
would
forever
destroy
your
peace
of
mind
all
at
once
she
began
to
cry
then
after
a
little
she
became
very
meek
and
said
that
she
had
suffered
so
from
the
bad
thoughts
that
came
to
her
i
then
walked
home
with
her
and
as
we
parted
company
she
promised
me
that
she
would
do
nothing
rash
if
i
would
only
keep
a
close
mouth
still
i
could
help
thinking
that
i
ought
to
talk
to
some
one
about
this
said
kaisa
but
to
whom
i
felt
kind
of
backward
about
going
to
big
folk
like
yourselves
just
then
the
bell
above
the
stable
rang
the
midday
rest
was
over
mother
martha
suddenly
interrupted
the
old
woman
i
say
kaisa
do
you
think
things
can
ever
be
right
again
between
ingmar
and
brita
what
gasped
the
old
woman
in
astonishment
i
mean
if
by
chance
she
were
not
going
to
america
do
you
suppose
she
would
have
him
well
i
should
say
not
then
you
are
quite
sure
she
would
give
him
no
for
an
answer
of
course
she
would
ingmar
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
his
legs
dangling
over
the
side
now
you
got
just
what
you
needed
ingmar
he
thought
and
now
i
guess
you
take
that
journey
he
said
pounding
the
edge
of
the
bed
with
his
fist
how
can
mother
think
she
get
me
to
stay
at
home
by
showing
me
that
brita
does
like
me
he
kept
pounding
the
side
of
the
bed
as
if
in
thought
he
were
knocking
down
something
that
was
resisting
him
anyway
i
going
to
chance
it
once
more
he
decided
we
ingmars
begin
all
over
again
when
things
go
wrong
no
man
that
is
a
man
can
sit
back
calmly
and
let
a
woman
fret
herself
insane
over
his
conduct
never
had
he
felt
so
keenly
his
utter
defeat
and
he
was
determined
to
put
himself
right
i
be
a
hell
of
a
man
if
i
could
make
brita
happy
here
he
said
he
dealt
the
bedpost
a
last
blow
before
getting
up
to
go
back
to
his
work
as
sure
as
you
born
it
was
big
ingmar
that
sent
old
kaisa
here
in
order
to
make
me
tale
that
trip
to
the
city
iv
ingmar
ingmarsson
had
arrived
in
the
city
and
was
walking
slowly
toward
the
big
prison
house
which
was
beautifully
situated
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
overlooking
the
public
park
he
did
not
glance
about
him
but
went
with
eyes
downcast
dragging
himself
along
with
as
much
difficulty
as
though
he
were
some
feeble
old
man
he
had
left
off
his
usual
picturesque
peasant
garb
on
this
occasion
and
was
wearing
a
black
cloth
suit
and
a
starched
shirt
which
he
had
already
crumpled
he
felt
very
solemn
yet
all
the
while
he
was
anxious
and
reluctant
on
coming
to
the
gravelled
yard
in
front
of
the
jail
he
saw
a
guard
on
duty
and
asked
him
if
this
was
not
the
day
that
brita
ericsson
was
to
be
discharged
yes
i
think
there
is
a
woman
coming
out
the
guard
answered
one
who
has
been
in
for
infanticide
ingmar
explained
oh
that
one
yes
she
be
out
this
forenoon
ingmar
stationed
himself
under
a
tree
to
wait
not
for
a
second
did
he
take
his
eyes
off
the
prison
gate
i
dare
say
there
are
some
among
those
who
have
gone
in
there
that
have
fared
any
too
well
he
thought
i
do
want
to
brag
but
maybe
there
many
a
one
on
the
inside
that
has
suffered
less
than
i
who
am
outside
well
i
declare
big
ingmar
has
brought
me
here
to
fetch
my
bride
from
the
prison
house
he
remarked
to
himself
but
i
ca
say
that
little
ingmar
is
overpleased
at
the
thought
he
would
have
liked
seeing
her
pass
through
a
gate
of
honour
instead
with
her
mother
standing
by
her
side
to
give
her
to
the
bridegroom
and
then
they
should
have
driven
to
the
church
in
a
chaise
followed
by
a
big
bridal
procession
and
she
should
have
sat
beside
him
dressed
as
a
bride
and
smiling
under
her
bridal
crown
the
gate
opened
several
times
first
a
chaplain
come
out
then
it
was
the
wife
of
the
governor
of
the
prison
and
then
some
servants
who
were
going
to
town
finally
brita
came
when
the
gate
opened
he
felt
a
cramp
at
the
heart
it
is
she
he
thought
his
eyes
dropped
he
was
as
if
paralyzed
and
could
not
move
when
he
had
recovered
himself
he
looked
up
she
was
then
standing
on
the
steps
outside
the
gate
she
stood
there
a
moment
quite
still
she
had
pushed
back
her
headshawl
and
with
eyes
that
were
clear
and
open
she
looked
out
across
the
landscape
the
prison
stood
on
high
ground
and
beyond
the
town
and
the
stretches
of
forest
she
could
see
her
native
hills
suddenly
she
seemed
to
be
shaken
by
some
unseen
force
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
sank
down
upon
the
stone
step
ingmar
could
hear
her
sobs
from
where
he
stood
presently
he
went
over
to
her
and
waited
she
was
crying
so
hard
that
she
seemed
deaf
to
every
other
sound
and
he
had
to
stand
there
a
long
time
at
last
he
said
do
cry
like
that
brita
she
looked
up
o
god
in
heaven
she
exclaimed
are
you
here
instantly
all
that
she
had
done
to
him
flashed
across
her
mind
and
what
it
must
have
cost
him
to
come
with
a
cry
of
joy
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
began
to
sob
again
how
i
have
longed
that
you
might
come
she
said
ingmar
heart
began
to
beat
faster
at
the
thought
of
her
being
so
pleased
with
him
why
brita
have
you
really
been
longing
for
me
he
said
quite
moved
i
have
wanted
so
much
to
ask
your
forgiveness
ingmar
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
said
very
coldly
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
for
that
i
do
think
we
ought
to
stop
here
any
longer
no
this
is
no
place
to
stop
at
she
answered
meekly
i
have
put
up
at
lövberg
he
said
as
they
walked
along
the
road
that
where
my
trunk
is
i
have
seen
it
there
said
ingmar
it
too
big
for
the
back
of
the
cart
so
it
will
have
to
be
left
there
till
we
can
send
for
it
brita
stopped
and
looked
up
at
him
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
intimated
that
he
meant
to
take
her
home
i
had
a
letter
from
father
he
says
that
you
also
think
that
i
ought
to
go
to
america
i
thought
there
was
no
harm
in
our
having
a
second
choice
it
was
so
certain
that
you
would
care
to
come
back
with
me
she
noticed
that
he
said
nothing
about
wanting
her
to
come
but
maybe
it
was
because
he
did
not
wish
to
force
himself
upon
her
a
second
time
she
grew
very
reluctant
it
could
be
an
enviable
task
to
take
one
of
her
kind
to
the
ingmar
farm
then
something
seemed
to
say
tell
him
that
you
will
go
to
america
it
is
the
only
service
you
can
render
him
tell
him
that
tell
him
that
urged
something
within
her
and
while
this
thought
was
still
in
her
mind
she
heard
some
one
say
i
afraid
that
i
am
not
strong
enough
to
go
to
america
they
tell
me
that
you
have
to
work
very
hard
over
there
it
was
as
if
another
had
spoken
and
not
she
herself
so
they
say
ingmar
said
indifferently
she
was
ashamed
of
her
weakness
and
thought
of
how
only
that
morning
she
had
told
the
prison
chaplain
that
she
was
going
out
into
the
world
a
new
and
a
better
woman
thoroughly
displeased
with
herself
she
walked
silently
for
some
time
wondering
how
she
should
take
back
her
words
but
as
soon
as
she
tried
to
speak
she
was
held
back
by
the
thought
that
if
he
still
cared
for
her
it
would
be
the
basest
kind
of
ingratitude
to
repulse
him
again
if
i
could
only
read
his
thoughts
she
said
herself
presently
she
stopped
and
leaned
against
a
wall
all
this
noise
and
the
sight
of
so
many
people
makes
my
bead
go
round
she
said
he
put
out
his
hand
which
she
took
then
they
went
along
hand
in
hand
ingmar
was
thinking
now
we
look
like
sweethearts
all
the
same
he
wondered
how
it
would
be
when
he
got
home
how
his
mother
and
the
rest
of
the
folks
would
take
it
when
they
came
to
lövberg
place
ingmar
said
that
his
horse
was
now
thoroughly
rested
and
if
she
had
no
objection
they
might
as
well
cover
the
first
few
stations
that
day
then
she
thought
now
is
the
time
to
tell
him
that
you
wo
go
thank
him
first
then
tell
him
that
you
do
want
to
go
with
him
she
prayed
god
that
she
might
be
shown
if
he
had
come
for
her
only
out
of
pity
in
the
meantime
ingmar
had
drawn
the
cart
out
of
the
shed
the
cart
had
been
newly
painted
the
dasher
shone
and
the
cushions
had
fresh
covering
to
the
buckboard
was
attached
a
little
bouquet
of
wild
flowers
the
sight
of
the
flowers
made
her
stop
and
think
ingmar
meanwhile
had
gone
back
to
the
stable
and
harnessed
the
horse
and
was
now
leading
him
out
then
she
discovered
another
bouquet
of
the
same
sort
between
the
harness
and
began
to
feel
that
after
all
he
must
like
her
so
it
seemed
best
not
to
say
anything
otherwise
he
might
think
she
was
ungrateful
and
that
she
did
not
understand
how
big
a
thing
he
was
offering
her
for
a
time
they
drove
along
without
exchanging
a
word
then
in
order
to
break
the
silence
she
began
to
question
him
about
various
home
matters
with
every
question
he
was
reminded
of
some
one
or
other
whose
judgment
he
feared
how
so
and
so
will
wonder
and
how
so
and
so
will
laugh
at
me
he
thought
he
answered
only
in
monosyllables
time
and
again
she
felt
like
begging
him
to
turn
back
he
does
want
me
she
thought
he
does
care
for
me
he
is
doing
this
only
out
of
charity
she
soon
stopped
asking
questions
they
drove
on
for
miles
in
deep
silence
when
they
came
to
their
first
stopping
place
which
was
an
inn
there
were
coffee
and
hot
biscuits
in
readiness
for
them
and
on
the
tray
were
some
more
flowers
she
knew
then
that
he
had
ordered
this
the
day
before
when
passing
was
that
too
done
only
out
of
kindness
and
pity
was
he
happy
yesterday
was
it
only
that
he
had
lost
heart
after
seeing
her
come
out
of
prison
when
he
had
forgotten
this
perhaps
all
would
be
well
again
sorrow
and
remorse
had
softened
brita
she
did
not
grant
to
cause
him
any
more
unhappiness
perhaps
after
all
he
really
they
stayed
at
the
inn
overnight
and
left
early
the
next
morning
by
ten
they
were
already
within
sight
of
their
parish
church
as
they
drove
along
the
road
leading
to
the
church
it
was
thronged
with
people
and
the
bells
were
ringing
why
it
sunday
brita
exclaimed
instinctively
folding
her
hands
she
forgot
everything
else
in
the
thought
of
going
to
church
and
praising
god
she
wanted
to
begin
her
new
life
with
a
service
in
the
old
church
i
should
love
to
go
to
church
she
said
to
ingmar
never
thinking
that
it
might
be
embarrassing
for
him
be
seen
there
with
her
she
was
all
devotion
and
gratitude
ingmar
first
impulse
was
to
say
that
she
could
he
felt
somehow
that
he
had
not
the
courage
to
face
the
curious
glances
and
gossiping
tongues
of
these
people
it
has
got
to
be
met
sooner
or
later
he
thought
putting
it
off
wo
make
it
any
easier
he
turned
and
drove
in
on
the
church
grounds
the
service
had
not
yet
started
and
many
persons
were
sitting
in
the
grass
and
on
the
stone
hedge
watching
the
people
arrive
the
instant
they
saw
ingmar
and
brita
they
began
to
nudge
each
other
and
whisper
and
point
ingmar
glanced
at
brita
she
sat
there
with
clasped
hands
quite
unconscious
of
the
things
about
her
she
saw
no
persons
apparently
but
ingmar
saw
them
only
too
well
they
came
running
after
the
wagon
and
did
not
wonder
at
their
running
or
their
stares
they
must
have
thought
that
their
eyes
had
deceived
them
of
course
they
could
not
believe
that
he
had
come
to
the
house
of
god
with
her
the
woman
who
had
strangled
his
child
this
is
too
much
he
said
i
ca
stand
it
i
think
you
better
go
inside
at
once
brita
he
suggested
why
certainly
she
answered
to
attend
service
was
her
only
thought
she
had
not
come
there
to
meet
people
ingmar
took
his
own
time
unharnessing
and
feeding
the
horse
many
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
but
nobody
spoke
to
him
by
the
time
he
was
ready
to
go
into
the
church
most
of
the
people
were
already
in
their
pews
and
the
opening
hymn
was
being
sung
walking
down
the
centre
isle
he
glanced
over
at
the
side
where
the
women
were
seated
all
the
pews
were
filled
save
one
and
in
that
there
was
only
one
person
he
saw
at
once
that
it
was
brita
and
knew
of
course
that
no
one
had
cared
to
sit
with
her
ingmar
went
and
sat
down
beside
her
brita
looked
up
at
him
in
wonderment
she
had
not
noticed
it
before
but
now
she
understood
why
she
had
the
pew
to
herself
then
the
deep
feeling
of
devotion
which
she
had
but
just
experienced
was
dispelled
by
a
sense
of
black
despair
how
would
it
all
end
she
wondered
she
should
never
have
come
with
him
her
eyes
began
to
fill
to
keep
from
breaking
down
she
took
up
an
old
prayerbook
from
the
shelf
in
front
of
her
and
opened
it
she
kept
turning
the
leaves
of
both
gospels
and
epistles
without
being
able
to
see
a
word
for
the
tears
suddenly
something
bright
caught
her
eye
it
was
a
bookmark
with
a
red
heart
which
lay
between
the
leaves
she
took
it
out
and
slipped
it
toward
ingmar
she
saw
him
close
his
big
hand
over
it
and
steal
a
glance
at
it
shortly
afterward
it
lay
upon
the
floor
what
is
to
become
of
us
thought
brita
sobbing
behind
the
prayerbook
as
soon
as
the
preacher
had
stepped
down
from
the
pulpit
they
went
out
ingmar
hurriedly
hitched
up
the
horse
with
brita
help
by
the
time
the
benediction
was
pronounced
and
the
congregation
was
beginning
to
file
out
brita
and
ingmar
were
already
off
both
seemed
to
be
thinking
the
same
thought
one
who
has
committed
such
a
crime
can
not
live
among
people
the
two
fell
as
if
they
had
been
doing
penance
by
appearing
at
church
neither
of
us
will
be
able
to
stand
it
they
thought
in
the
midst
of
her
distress
of
mind
brita
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
ingmar
farm
and
hardly
knew
it
again
it
looked
so
bright
and
red
she
remembered
having
heard
that
the
house
was
to
be
painted
the
year
ingmar
married
before
the
wedding
had
been
put
off
because
he
had
felt
that
he
could
not
afford
to
pay
out
any
money
just
then
now
she
understood
that
he
had
always
meant
to
have
everything
right
but
the
way
had
been
made
rather
hard
for
him
when
they
arrived
at
the
farm
the
folks
were
at
dinner
here
comes
the
boss
said
one
of
the
men
looking
out
mother
martha
got
up
from
the
table
scarcely
lifting
her
heavy
eyelids
stay
where
you
are
all
of
you
she
commanded
no
one
need
rise
from
the
table
the
old
woman
walked
heavily
across
the
room
those
who
turned
to
look
after
her
noticed
that
she
had
on
her
best
dress
with
her
silk
shawl
across
her
shoulders
and
her
silk
kerchief
on
her
head
as
if
to
emphasize
her
authority
when
the
horse
stopped
she
was
already
at
the
door
ingmar
jumped
down
at
once
but
brita
kept
her
seat
he
went
over
to
her
side
and
unfastened
the
carriage
apron
are
you
going
to
get
out
he
said
no
she
replied
then
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
she
burst
into
tears
i
ought
never
to
have
come
back
she
sobbed
oh
do
get
down
he
urged
let
me
go
back
to
the
city
i
not
good
enough
for
you
ingmar
thought
that
maybe
she
was
right
about
it
but
said
nothing
he
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
apron
and
waited
what
does
she
say
asked
mother
martha
from
the
doorway
she
says
she
is
good
enough
for
us
ingmar
replied
for
brita
words
could
scarcely
be
heard
for
her
sobs
what
is
she
crying
about
asked
the
old
woman
because
i
am
such
a
miserable
sinner
said
brita
pressing
her
hands
to
her
heart
which
she
thought
would
break
what
that
the
old
woman
asked
once
more
she
says
she
is
such
a
miserable
sinner
ingmar
repeated
when
brita
heard
him
repeat
her
words
in
a
cold
and
indifferent
tone
the
truth
suddenly
flashed
upon
her
no
he
could
never
have
stood
there
and
repeated
those
words
to
his
mother
had
he
been
fond
of
her
or
had
there
been
a
spark
of
love
in
his
heart
for
her
why
does
she
get
down
the
old
woman
then
asked
suppressing
her
sobs
brita
spoke
up
because
i
do
want
to
bring
misfortune
upon
ingmar
i
think
she
is
quite
right
said
the
old
mistress
let
her
go
little
ingmar
you
may
as
well
know
that
otherwise
i
be
the
one
to
leave
for
i
not
sleep
one
night
under
the
same
roof
with
the
likes
of
her
for
god
sake
let
me
go
brita
moaned
ingmar
ripped
out
an
oath
turned
the
horse
and
sprang
into
the
cart
he
was
sick
and
tired
of
all
this
and
could
not
stand
any
more
of
it
out
on
the
highway
they
kept
meeting
church
people
this
annoyed
ingmar
suddenly
he
turned
the
horse
and
drove
in
on
a
narrow
forest
road
as
he
turned
some
one
called
to
him
he
glanced
back
it
was
the
postman
with
a
letter
for
him
he
took
the
letter
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
and
drove
on
as
soon
as
he
felt
sure
that
he
could
not
be
seen
from
the
road
he
slowed
down
and
brought
out
the
letter
instantly
brita
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
do
read
it
she
begged
why
not
he
asked
never
mind
reading
it
it
nothing
but
how
can
you
know
it
a
letter
from
me
then
tell
me
yourself
what
in
it
no
i
ca
tell
you
that
he
looked
hard
at
her
she
turned
scarlet
her
eyes
growing
wild
with
alarm
i
guess
i
will
read
that
letter
anyway
said
ingmar
and
began
to
tear
open
the
envelope
o
heavenly
father
she
cried
am
i
then
to
be
spared
nothing
ingmar
she
implored
read
it
in
a
day
or
two
when
i
am
on
my
way
to
america
by
that
time
he
had
already
opened
the
letter
and
was
scanning
it
she
put
her
hand
over
the
paper
listen
to
me
ingmar
she
said
it
was
the
chaplain
who
got
me
to
write
that
letter
and
he
promised
not
to
send
it
till
i
was
on
board
the
steamer
instead
he
sent
it
off
too
soon
you
have
no
right
to
read
it
yet
wait
till
i
gone
ingmar
ingmar
gave
her
an
angry
look
and
jumped
out
of
the
wagon
so
that
he
might
read
the
letter
in
peace
brita
was
as
much
excited
now
as
she
had
been
in
the
old
days
when
things
did
not
go
her
way
what
i
say
in
that
letter
is
true
the
chaplain
talked
me
into
writing
it
i
love
you
ingmar
he
looked
up
from
the
paper
and
gazed
at
her
in
astonishment
then
she
grew
silent
and
the
lessons
in
humility
which
she
had
learned
in
prison
profited
her
now
after
all
she
suffered
no
greater
embarrassment
than
she
deserved
ingmar
meanwhile
stood
puzzling
over
the
letter
suddenly
with
an
impatient
snarl
he
crumpled
it
up
i
ca
make
this
out
he
said
stamping
his
foot
my
head
all
in
a
muddle
he
went
up
to
brita
and
gripped
her
by
the
arm
does
it
really
say
in
the
letter
that
you
care
for
me
his
tone
was
shockingly
brutal
and
the
look
of
him
was
terrible
brita
was
silent
does
the
letter
say
that
you
care
for
me
he
repeated
savagely
yes
she
answered
faintly
then
his
face
became
horribly
distorted
he
shook
her
arm
and
thrust
it
from
him
how
you
can
lie
he
said
with
a
hoarse
and
angry
laugh
how
you
can
lie
god
knows
i
have
prayed
night
and
day
that
i
might
see
you
again
before
i
go
she
solemnly
avowed
where
are
you
going
i
going
to
america
of
course
the
hell
you
are
ingmar
was
beside
himself
he
staggered
a
few
steps
into
the
woods
and
cast
himself
upon
the
ground
and
now
it
was
his
turn
to
weep
brita
followed
him
and
sat
down
beside
him
she
was
so
happy
that
she
wanted
to
shout
ingmar
little
ingmar
she
said
calling
him
by
his
pet
name
but
you
think
i
so
ugly
he
returned
of
course
i
do
ingmar
pushed
her
hand
away
now
let
me
tell
you
something
said
brita
tell
away
do
you
remember
what
you
said
in
court
three
years
ago
i
do
that
if
i
could
only
get
to
think
differently
of
you
you
would
marry
me
yes
i
remember
it
was
after
that
i
began
to
care
for
you
i
had
never
imagined
that
any
mortal
could
say
such
a
thing
it
seemed
almost
unbelievable
your
saying
it
to
me
after
all
i
had
done
to
you
as
i
saw
you
that
day
i
thought
you
better
looking
than
all
the
others
and
you
were
wiser
than
any
of
them
and
the
only
one
with
whom
it
would
be
good
to
share
one
life
i
fell
so
deeply
in
love
with
you
that
it
seemed
as
if
you
belonged
to
me
and
i
to
you
at
first
i
took
it
for
granted
that
you
would
come
and
fetch
me
but
later
i
hardly
dared
think
it
ingmar
raised
his
head
then
why
did
you
write
he
asked
but
i
did
write
asking
me
to
forgive
you
as
if
that
were
anything
to
write
about
what
should
i
have
written
about
the
other
thing
how
would
i
have
dared
i
i
came
mighty
near
not
coming
at
all
but
ingmar
do
you
suppose
i
could
have
written
love
letters
to
you
after
all
i
had
done
my
last
day
in
prison
i
wrote
to
you
because
the
chaplain
said
i
must
when
i
gave
him
the
letter
he
promised
not
to
send
it
until
i
was
well
on
my
way
ingmar
took
her
hand
and
flattened
it
against
the
earth
then
slapped
it
i
could
beat
you
he
said
you
may
do
with
me
what
you
will
ingmar
he
looked
up
into
her
face
upon
which
suffering
had
wrought
a
new
kind
of
beauty
and
i
came
so
near
letting
you
go
he
sighed
you
just
had
to
come
i
suppose
let
me
tell
you
that
i
did
care
for
you
i
do
wonder
at
that
i
felt
relieved
when
i
heard
that
you
were
to
be
sent
to
america
yes
father
wrote
me
that
you
were
pleased
whenever
i
looked
at
mother
i
felt
somehow
that
i
could
ask
her
to
accept
a
like
you
no
it
would
never
do
ingmar
i
had
to
put
up
with
a
lot
on
your
account
no
one
would
notice
me
because
of
my
treatment
of
you
now
you
are
doing
what
you
threatened
to
do
said
brita
striking
me
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
how
mad
i
am
at
you
she
kept
still
when
i
think
of
all
i
had
to
stand
these
last
few
weeks
he
went
on
but
ingmar
oh
i
not
angry
about
that
but
at
the
thought
of
how
near
i
came
to
letting
you
go
did
you
love
me
ingmar
no
indeed
not
during
the
whole
journey
home
no
not
for
a
second
i
was
just
put
out
with
you
when
did
you
change
when
i
got
your
letter
i
saw
that
your
love
was
over
that
was
why
i
did
not
want
you
to
know
that
mine
was
but
just
beginning
ingmar
chuckled
what
amuses
you
ingmar
i
thinking
of
how
we
sneaked
out
of
church
and
of
the
kind
of
welcome
we
got
at
the
ingmar
farm
and
you
can
laugh
at
that
why
not
as
well
laugh
i
suppose
we
have
to
take
to
the
road
like
tramps
wonder
what
father
would
say
to
that
you
may
laugh
ingmar
but
this
ca
be
it
ca
be
i
think
it
can
for
now
i
do
care
a
damn
about
anything
or
anybody
but
you
brita
was
ready
to
cry
but
he
just
made
her
tell
him
again
and
again
how
often
she
had
thought
of
him
and
how
much
she
had
longed
for
him
little
by
little
he
became
as
quiet
as
a
child
listening
to
a
lullaby
it
was
all
so
different
from
what
brita
had
expected
she
had
thought
of
talking
to
him
about
her
crime
if
he
came
for
her
and
the
weight
of
it
she
would
have
liked
to
tell
either
him
or
her
mother
or
whoever
had
come
for
her
how
unworthy
she
was
of
them
but
not
a
word
of
this
had
she
been
allowed
to
speak
presently
he
said
very
gently
there
is
something
you
want
to
tell
me
yes
and
you
are
thinking
about
it
all
the
time
day
and
night
and
it
gets
sort
of
mixed
in
with
everything
that
true
now
tell
me
about
it
so
there
will
be
two
instead
of
one
to
bear
it
he
sat
looking
into
her
eyes
they
were
like
the
eyes
of
a
poor
hunted
fawn
but
as
she
spoke
they
became
calmer
now
you
feel
better
he
said
when
she
had
finished
i
feel
as
if
a
great
weight
had
been
lifted
from
my
heart
that
is
because
we
are
two
to
bear
it
now
perhaps
you
want
to
go
away
indeed
i
should
love
to
stay
she
said
then
let
us
go
home
said
ingmar
rising
no
i
afraid
mother
is
not
so
terrible
lie
laughed
when
she
sees
that
one
has
a
mind
of
one
own
no
ingmar
i
could
never
turn
her
out
of
her
home
i
have
no
choice
but
to
go
to
america
i
going
to
tell
you
something
said
ingmar
with
a
mysterious
smile
you
need
be
the
least
bit
afraid
for
there
is
some
one
who
will
help
us
who
is
it
it
father
he
see
to
it
that
everything
comes
out
right
there
was
some
one
coming
along
the
forest
road
it
was
kaisa
but
as
she
was
not
bearing
the
familiar
yoke
with
the
baskets
they
hardly
knew
her
at
first
to
you
greeted
ingmar
and
brita
and
the
old
woman
came
up
and
shook
hands
with
them
well
i
declare
here
you
sit
and
all
the
folks
from
the
farm
out
looking
for
you
you
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
out
of
church
the
old
woman
went
on
that
i
never
got
to
meet
you
at
all
so
i
went
down
to
the
farm
to
pay
my
respects
to
brita
when
i
got
there
who
should
i
see
but
the
dean
and
he
was
in
the
house
calling
mother
martha
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
before
i
even
had
a
chance
to
say
d
do
and
before
he
had
so
much
as
shaken
hands
with
her
he
was
crying
out
mother
martha
you
can
be
proud
of
ingmar
it
plain
now
that
he
belongs
to
the
old
stock
so
we
must
begin
to
call
him
ingmar
mother
martha
as
you
know
never
says
very
much
she
just
stood
there
tying
knots
in
her
shawl
this
you
telling
me
she
said
finally
has
brought
brita
home
the
dean
explained
believe
me
mother
martha
he
will
be
honoured
and
respected
for
it
as
long
as
he
lives
do
tell
me
said
the
old
lady
could
hardly
go
on
with
the
service
when
i
saw
them
sitting
in
church
it
was
a
better
sermon
than
any
i
could
ever
preach
ingmar
will
be
a
credit
to
us
all
as
his
father
before
him
was
dean
brings
us
great
news
said
mother
martha
he
home
yet
asked
the
dean
he
is
not
at
home
but
they
may
have
stopped
at
bergskog
first
did
mother
really
say
that
cried
ingmar
why
of
course
she
did
and
while
we
sat
waiting
for
you
to
appear
she
sent
out
one
messenger
after
the
other
to
look
for
you
kaisa
kept
up
a
steady
stream
of
talk
but
ingmar
no
longer
heard
what
she
said
his
thoughts
were
far
away
i
come
into
the
where
father
sits
with
all
the
old
ingmars
to
you
big
ingmar
ingmarsson
says
father
rising
and
coming
toward
me
same
to
you
father
says
i
thank
you
for
your
help
you
be
well
married
says
father
then
the
other
matters
will
all
right
themselves
father
it
could
never
have
turned
out
so
well
if
you
had
stood
by
me
was
nothing
says
father
we
ingmars
need
do
is
to
walk
in
the
ways
of
god
book
two
at
the
in
the
early
eighties
there
was
no
one
in
the
parish
where
the
old
ingmarsson
family
lived
who
would
have
thought
of
embracing
any
new
kind
of
faith
or
attending
any
new
form
of
sacred
service
that
new
sects
had
sprung
up
here
and
there
in
other
dalecarlian
parishes
and
that
people
went
out
into
rivers
and
lakes
to
be
immersed
in
accordance
with
the
new
rites
of
the
baptists
was
known
but
folks
only
laughed
at
it
all
and
said
that
sort
of
thing
may
suit
those
who
live
at
applebo
and
in
gagnef
but
it
can
never
touch
our
parish
the
people
of
that
parish
clung
to
their
old
customs
and
habits
one
of
which
was
a
regular
attendance
at
church
on
sundays
every
one
that
could
go
went
even
in
the
severest
winter
weather
then
of
all
times
it
was
almost
a
necessity
with
the
thermometer
at
twenty
below
zero
outside
it
would
have
been
beyond
human
endurance
to
sit
in
the
unheated
church
had
it
not
been
packed
to
the
doors
with
people
it
could
not
be
said
of
the
parishioners
that
they
turned
out
in
such
great
numbers
because
they
had
a
particularly
brilliant
pastor
or
one
who
had
any
special
gift
for
expounding
the
scriptures
in
those
days
folks
went
to
church
to
praise
god
and
not
to
be
entertained
by
fine
sermons
on
the
way
home
when
fighting
against
the
cutting
wind
on
an
open
country
road
one
thought
our
lord
must
have
noticed
that
you
were
at
church
this
cold
morning
that
was
the
main
thing
it
was
no
fault
of
theirs
if
the
preacher
had
said
nothing
more
than
he
had
been
heard
to
say
every
sunday
since
his
appointment
to
the
pastorate
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
majority
seemed
perfectly
satisfied
with
what
they
got
they
knew
that
what
the
pastor
read
to
them
was
the
word
of
god
and
therefore
they
found
it
altogether
beautiful
only
the
schoolmaster
and
one
or
two
of
the
more
intelligent
farmers
occasionally
said
among
themselves
the
parson
seems
to
have
only
one
sermon
he
talks
of
nothing
but
god
wisdom
and
government
all
that
is
well
enough
so
long
as
the
dissenters
keep
away
but
this
stronghold
is
poorly
defended
and
would
fall
at
the
first
attack
lay
preachers
generally
passed
by
this
parish
what
the
good
of
going
there
they
used
to
say
those
people
do
want
to
be
awakened
not
only
the
lay
preachers
but
even
all
the
awakened
souls
in
the
neighbouring
parishes
looked
upon
the
ingmarssons
and
their
as
great
sinners
and
whenever
they
caught
the
sound
of
the
bells
from
their
church
they
would
say
the
bells
were
tolling
sleep
in
your
sins
sleep
in
your
sins
the
whole
congregation
old
and
young
alike
were
furious
when
they
learned
that
people
spoke
in
that
way
of
their
bells
they
knew
that
their
folks
never
forgot
to
repeat
the
lord
prayer
whenever
the
church
bells
rang
and
that
every
evening
at
the
time
of
the
angelus
the
menfolk
uncovered
their
heads
the
women
courtesied
and
everybody
stood
still
about
as
long
as
it
takes
to
say
an
our
father
all
who
have
lived
in
that
parish
must
acknowledge
that
god
never
seemed
so
mighty
and
so
honoured
as
on
summer
evenings
when
scythes
were
rested
and
plows
were
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
furrow
and
the
seed
wagon
was
halted
in
the
midst
of
the
loading
simply
at
the
stroke
of
a
bell
it
was
as
if
they
knew
that
our
lord
at
that
moment
was
hovering
over
the
parish
on
an
evening
cloud
great
and
powerful
and
good
breathing
his
blessing
upon
the
whole
community
none
of
your
men
had
ever
taught
in
that
parish
the
schoolmaster
was
just
a
plain
farmer
who
was
he
was
a
capable
man
who
could
manage
a
hundred
children
for
thirty
years
and
more
he
had
been
the
only
teacher
there
and
was
looked
up
to
by
everybody
the
schoolmaster
seemed
to
feel
that
the
spiritual
welfare
of
the
entire
congregation
rested
with
him
and
was
therefore
quite
concerned
at
their
having
called
a
parson
who
was
no
kind
of
a
preacher
however
he
held
his
peace
as
long
as
it
was
only
a
question
of
introducing
a
new
form
of
baptism
and
elsewhere
at
that
but
on
learning
that
there
had
also
been
some
changes
in
the
administration
of
the
holy
communion
and
that
people
were
beginning
to
gather
in
private
homes
to
partake
of
the
sacrament
he
could
no
longer
remain
passive
although
a
poor
man
himself
he
managed
to
persuade
some
of
the
leading
citizens
to
raise
the
money
to
build
a
mission
house
you
know
me
he
said
to
them
i
only
want
to
preach
in
order
to
strengthen
people
in
the
old
faith
what
would
be
the
natural
result
if
the
lay
preachers
were
to
come
upon
us
with
their
new
baptism
and
their
new
sacrament
if
there
were
no
one
to
tell
the
people
what
was
the
true
doctrine
and
what
the
false
the
schoolmaster
was
as
well
liked
by
the
clergyman
as
by
every
one
else
he
and
the
parson
were
frequently
seen
strolling
together
along
the
road
between
the
schoolhouse
and
the
parsonage
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
as
if
they
had
no
end
of
things
to
say
to
each
other
the
parson
would
often
drop
in
at
the
schoolmaster
of
an
evening
to
sit
in
the
cozy
kitchen
by
an
open
fire
and
chat
with
the
schoolmaster
wife
mother
stina
at
times
he
came
night
after
night
he
had
a
dreary
time
of
it
at
home
his
wife
was
always
ailing
and
there
was
neither
order
nor
comfort
in
his
house
one
winter
evening
the
schoolmaster
and
his
wife
were
sitting
by
the
kitchen
fire
talking
in
earnest
whispers
while
a
little
girl
of
twelve
played
by
herself
in
a
corner
of
the
room
the
little
girl
was
their
daughter
and
her
name
was
gertrude
she
was
a
fair
little
lass
with
flaxen
hair
and
plump
rosy
cheeks
but
she
did
not
have
that
wise
and
prematurely
old
look
which
one
so
often
sees
in
the
children
of
schoolmasters
the
corner
in
which
she
sat
was
her
playground
there
she
had
gathered
together
a
variety
of
things
bits
of
coloured
glass
broken
teacups
and
saucers
pebbles
from
the
banks
of
the
river
little
square
blocks
of
wood
and
more
rubbish
of
the
same
sort
she
had
been
let
play
in
peace
all
the
evening
neither
her
father
nor
her
mother
had
disturbed
her
busy
as
she
was
she
did
not
want
to
be
reminded
of
lessons
and
chores
it
did
look
as
if
there
were
going
to
be
any
extra
sums
to
do
for
father
that
night
she
thought
she
had
a
big
work
in
hand
the
little
girl
back
there
in
her
corner
nothing
less
than
making
a
whole
parish
she
was
going
to
build
up
the
entire
district
with
both
church
and
schoolhouse
the
river
and
the
bridge
were
also
to
be
included
everything
had
to
be
quite
complete
of
course
she
had
already
got
a
good
part
of
it
done
the
whole
wreath
of
hills
that
went
round
the
parish
was
made
up
of
smaller
and
larger
stones
in
all
the
crevices
she
had
planted
forests
of
little
spruce
twigs
and
with
two
jagged
stones
she
had
erected
klack
mountain
and
olaf
peak
on
either
side
of
the
dal
river
the
long
valley
in
between
the
mountains
had
been
covered
with
mould
taken
from
one
of
her
mother
flowerpots
so
far
everything
was
all
right
only
she
had
not
been
able
to
make
the
galley
blossom
but
she
comforted
herself
by
pretending
it
was
early
springtime
before
grass
and
grain
had
sprouted
the
broad
beautiful
dal
river
that
flows
through
the
valley
she
had
managed
to
lay
out
effectively
with
a
long
and
narrow
piece
of
glass
and
the
floating
bridge
connecting
both
sides
of
the
parish
had
been
making
on
the
water
this
long
while
the
more
distant
farms
and
settlements
were
marked
off
by
pieces
of
red
brick
farthest
north
amid
fields
and
meadows
lay
the
ingmar
farm
to
the
east
was
the
village
of
kolasen
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
at
the
extreme
south
where
the
river
with
rapids
and
falls
leaves
the
valley
and
rushes
under
the
mountain
was
bergsana
foundry
the
entire
landscape
was
now
ready
with
country
roads
laid
out
along
the
river
sanded
and
gravelled
groves
had
also
been
set
out
here
and
there
on
the
plains
and
near
the
cottages
the
little
girl
had
only
to
cast
a
glance
at
her
structure
of
glass
and
stone
and
earth
and
twigs
to
see
before
her
the
whole
parish
and
she
thought
it
all
very
beautiful
time
after
time
she
raised
her
head
to
call
her
mother
and
show
her
what
she
had
done
then
changed
her
mind
she
had
always
found
it
wiser
not
to
call
attention
to
herself
but
the
most
difficult
work
of
all
was
yet
to
come
the
building
up
of
the
town
on
both
sides
of
the
river
it
meant
much
shifting
about
of
stones
and
bits
of
glass
the
sheriff
house
wanted
to
crowd
out
the
merchant
shop
there
was
no
room
for
the
judge
house
next
door
to
the
doctor
there
were
the
church
and
the
parsonage
the
and
the
peasant
homesteads
with
their
barns
and
outhouses
the
inn
the
hunter
lodge
the
telegraph
station
to
remember
everything
was
no
small
task
finally
the
whole
town
of
white
and
red
houses
stood
embedded
in
green
now
there
was
only
one
thing
left
she
had
worked
hard
to
get
everything
else
done
so
as
to
begin
on
the
schoolhouse
she
wanted
plenty
of
space
for
the
school
which
was
to
be
built
on
the
riverside
and
must
have
a
big
yard
with
a
flagpole
right
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
she
had
saved
all
her
best
blocks
for
the
schoolhouse
now
she
wondered
how
she
had
best
go
about
it
she
wanted
it
to
be
just
like
their
school
with
a
big
classroom
on
the
ground
floor
and
another
upstairs
then
there
was
the
kitchen
and
also
the
big
room
where
she
and
her
parents
lived
but
all
that
would
take
a
good
while
they
wo
leave
me
in
peace
long
enough
she
said
to
herself
just
then
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
entry
some
one
was
stamping
off
snow
in
a
twinkling
she
went
ahead
with
her
building
here
comes
the
parson
to
chat
with
father
and
mother
she
thought
now
she
would
have
the
whole
evening
to
herself
and
with
renewed
courage
she
began
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
schoolhouse
as
big
as
half
the
parish
her
mother
who
had
also
heard
the
steps
in
the
hall
got
up
quickly
and
drew
an
old
armchair
up
to
the
fireplace
then
turning
to
her
husband
she
said
shall
you
tell
him
about
it
yes
answered
the
schoolmaster
as
soon
as
i
can
get
round
to
it
presently
the
pastor
came
in
half
frozen
and
glad
to
be
in
a
warm
room
where
he
could
sit
by
an
open
fire
he
was
very
talkative
as
usual
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
more
likable
man
than
the
parson
when
he
came
in
of
an
evening
to
chat
about
all
sorts
of
things
big
and
little
he
spoke
with
such
ease
and
assurance
of
everything
pertaining
to
this
world
that
one
could
scarcely
believe
that
he
and
the
dull
preacher
were
one
and
the
same
person
but
if
you
happened
to
speak
to
him
about
spiritual
things
he
grew
red
in
the
face
began
fishing
for
words
and
never
said
anything
that
was
convincing
unless
he
chanced
to
mention
that
god
governs
wisely
when
the
parson
had
settled
himself
comfortably
the
schoolmaster
suddenly
turned
to
him
and
said
in
a
cheery
tone
now
i
must
tell
you
the
news
i
going
to
build
a
mission
house
the
clergyman
became
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
sank
back
in
his
chair
what
are
you
saying
storm
he
gasped
are
they
really
thinking
of
building
a
mission
house
here
then
what
to
become
of
me
and
the
church
are
we
to
be
dispensed
with
the
church
and
the
pastor
will
be
needed
just
the
same
returned
the
schoolmaster
with
a
confident
air
it
is
my
purpose
that
the
mission
house
shall
promote
the
welfare
of
the
church
with
so
many
schisms
cropping
up
all
over
the
country
the
church
is
sorely
in
need
of
help
i
thought
you
were
my
friend
storm
said
the
parson
mournfully
only
a
few
moments
before
he
had
come
in
confident
and
happy
and
now
all
at
once
his
spirit
was
gone
and
he
looked
as
if
he
were
entirely
done
for
the
schoolmaster
understood
quite
well
why
the
pastor
was
so
distressed
he
and
every
one
else
knew
that
at
one
time
the
clergyman
had
been
a
man
of
rare
promise
but
in
his
student
days
he
had
gone
the
pace
so
to
speak
and
in
consequence
had
suffered
a
stroke
after
that
he
was
never
the
same
sometimes
he
seemed
to
forget
that
he
was
only
the
ruin
of
a
man
but
when
reminded
of
it
a
sense
of
deep
despondency
came
over
him
now
he
sat
there
as
if
paralyzed
it
was
a
long
time
before
any
one
ventured
to
speak
you
must
take
it
like
that
parson
the
schoolmaster
said
at
last
trying
to
make
his
voice
very
soft
and
low
hush
storm
i
know
that
i
not
a
great
preacher
still
i
could
have
believed
it
possible
that
you
would
wish
to
take
the
living
from
me
storm
made
a
gesture
of
protest
which
said
in
effect
that
anything
of
the
sort
had
never
entered
his
mind
but
he
had
not
the
courage
to
put
it
into
words
the
schoolmaster
was
a
man
of
sixty
and
despite
all
the
work
and
responsibility
which
had
fallen
to
his
lot
he
was
still
master
of
his
forces
there
was
a
great
contrast
between
him
and
the
parson
storm
was
one
of
the
biggest
men
in
dalecarlia
his
head
was
covered
with
a
mass
of
black
bushy
hair
his
skin
was
as
dark
as
bronze
and
his
features
were
strong
and
clear
cut
he
looked
singularly
powerful
beside
the
pastor
who
was
a
little
man
the
schoolmaster
wife
thought
that
her
husband
as
the
stronger
ought
to
give
in
and
motioned
to
him
to
drop
the
matter
whatever
of
regret
he
may
have
felt
there
was
nothing
in
his
manner
to
indicate
that
he
had
any
idea
of
relinquishing
his
project
then
the
schoolmaster
began
to
speak
plainly
and
to
the
point
he
said
he
was
certain
that
before
long
the
heretics
would
invade
their
parish
therefore
it
was
very
necessary
that
they
should
have
a
meeting
place
where
one
could
talk
to
the
people
in
a
more
informal
way
than
at
a
regular
church
service
where
one
might
choose
one
own
text
expound
the
whole
bible
and
interpret
its
most
difficult
passages
to
the
people
his
wife
again
signed
to
him
to
keep
still
she
knew
what
the
clergyman
was
thinking
while
her
husband
talked
so
i
taught
them
anything
and
i
have
given
them
any
sort
of
protection
against
unbelief
i
must
be
a
poor
specimen
of
a
pastor
when
the
schoolmaster
in
my
own
parish
thinks
himself
a
better
preacher
than
i
the
schoolmaster
however
did
not
keep
still
but
went
on
talking
of
all
that
must
be
done
to
protect
the
flock
from
the
wolves
i
have
seen
any
wolves
said
the
pastor
but
i
know
they
are
on
their
way
and
you
storm
are
opening
the
door
to
them
declared
the
minister
rising
the
schoolmaster
talk
had
irritated
him
the
blood
mounted
to
his
face
and
he
regained
a
little
of
his
old
dignity
my
dear
storm
let
us
drop
the
subject
he
said
then
turning
to
the
housewife
he
passed
some
pleasant
remark
about
the
last
pretty
bride
she
had
dressed
for
mother
stina
dressed
all
the
brides
in
the
parish
peasant
woman
though
she
was
she
understood
how
it
must
hurt
him
to
be
so
cruelly
reminded
of
his
own
impotence
she
wept
from
compassion
and
could
not
answer
him
for
the
tears
so
the
pastor
had
to
do
most
of
the
talking
meanwhile
he
kept
thinking
oh
if
i
only
had
some
of
the
power
and
the
capacity
of
my
younger
days
i
would
convince
this
peasant
at
once
of
the
wrong
he
is
doing
with
that
he
turned
again
to
the
schoolmaster
where
did
you
get
the
money
storm
he
asked
a
company
has
been
formed
storm
explained
then
he
mentioned
the
names
of
several
men
who
had
pledged
their
support
just
to
show
the
parson
that
they
were
the
kind
of
people
who
would
harm
neither
the
church
nor
its
pastor
is
ingmar
ingmarsson
in
it
too
the
parson
exclaimed
the
effect
of
this
was
like
a
deathblow
and
to
think
that
i
was
as
sure
of
ingmar
ingmarsson
as
i
had
been
of
you
storm
he
said
nothing
more
about
this
just
then
but
instead
turned
to
mother
stina
and
talked
to
her
he
must
have
seen
that
she
was
crying
but
acted
as
if
he
had
not
noticed
it
in
a
little
while
he
again
addressed
the
schoolmaster
drop
it
storm
he
begged
drop
it
for
my
sake
you
like
it
if
somebody
put
up
another
school
next
to
yours
the
schoolmaster
sat
gazing
at
the
floor
and
reflected
a
moment
presently
he
said
almost
reluctantly
i
ca
parson
for
fully
ten
minutes
there
was
a
dead
silence
where
upon
the
pastor
put
on
his
overcoat
and
cap
and
went
toward
the
door
the
whole
evening
he
had
been
trying
to
find
words
with
which
to
prove
to
storm
that
he
was
not
only
doing
harm
to
the
pastor
with
this
undertaking
but
he
was
undermining
the
parish
although
thoughts
and
words
kept
crowding
into
his
head
he
could
neither
arrange
them
into
an
orderly
sequence
nor
give
utterance
to
them
because
he
was
a
broken
man
walking
toward
the
door
he
espied
gertrude
sitting
in
her
corner
playing
with
her
blocks
and
bits
of
glass
he
stopped
and
looked
at
her
evidently
she
had
not
heard
a
word
of
the
conversation
for
her
eyes
sparkled
with
delight
and
her
cheeks
were
like
roses
the
pastor
was
startled
at
the
sight
of
all
this
innocent
happiness
of
the
child
in
contrast
to
his
own
heart
heaviness
what
are
you
making
he
asked
and
went
up
to
her
the
little
girl
had
got
through
with
her
parish
long
before
that
in
fact
she
had
already
pulled
it
down
and
started
something
new
if
you
had
only
come
a
minute
sooner
exclaimed
the
child
i
had
made
such
a
beautiful
parish
with
both
church
and
schoolhouse
but
where
is
it
now
oh
i
destroyed
the
parish
and
now
i
building
a
jerusalem
and
what
interrupted
the
parson
have
you
destroyed
the
parish
in
order
to
build
a
jerusalem
yes
said
gertrude
and
it
was
such
a
fine
parish
but
we
read
about
jerusalem
yesterday
in
school
and
now
i
have
pulled
down
the
parish
to
build
a
jerusalem
the
preacher
stood
regarding
the
child
he
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
thought
a
moment
then
he
said
it
is
surely
someone
greater
than
you
that
speaks
through
your
mouth
the
child
words
seemed
to
him
so
extraordinarily
prophetic
that
he
kept
repeating
them
to
himself
over
and
over
gradually
his
thoughts
drifted
back
into
their
old
groove
and
he
began
to
ponder
the
ways
of
providence
and
the
means
by
which
he
works
his
will
presently
he
went
back
to
the
schoolmaster
his
eyes
shining
with
a
new
light
and
said
in
his
usual
cheery
tone
i
no
longer
angry
at
you
storm
you
are
only
doing
what
you
must
do
all
my
life
i
have
been
pondering
the
ways
of
providence
and
i
ca
seem
to
get
any
light
on
them
nor
do
i
understand
this
thing
but
i
understand
that
you
are
doing
what
you
needs
must
do
and
they
saw
heaven
open
the
spring
the
mission
house
was
built
there
was
a
great
thaw
and
the
dal
river
rose
to
an
alarming
height
and
what
quantities
of
water
that
spring
brought
it
came
in
showers
from
the
skies
it
came
rushing
down
in
streams
from
the
mountainsides
and
it
welled
out
of
the
earth
water
ran
in
every
wheel
rut
and
in
every
furrow
all
this
water
found
its
way
to
the
river
which
kept
rising
higher
and
higher
and
rolled
onward
with
greater
and
greater
force
it
did
not
present
its
usual
shiny
and
placid
appearance
but
had
turned
a
dirty
brown
from
all
the
muddy
water
that
kept
flowing
in
the
surging
stream
filled
with
logs
and
cakes
of
ice
looked
strangely
weird
and
threatening
at
first
the
grown
folks
paid
no
special
heed
to
the
spring
flood
only
the
children
ran
down
to
the
banks
to
watch
the
raging
river
and
all
that
it
carried
along
but
timber
and
ice
floes
were
not
the
only
things
that
went
floating
by
presently
the
stream
came
driving
with
washing
piers
and
bath
houses
then
with
boats
and
wreckage
of
bridges
it
will
soon
be
taking
our
bridge
too
the
children
exclaimed
they
felt
a
bit
uneasy
but
were
glad
at
the
same
time
that
something
so
extraordinary
was
likely
to
happen
suddenly
a
huge
pine
root
and
branch
came
sailing
past
followed
by
a
aspen
tree
its
spreading
branches
thick
with
buds
which
had
swelled
from
being
so
long
in
the
water
close
upon
the
trees
came
a
little
hay
shed
bottom
upward
it
was
still
full
of
hay
and
straw
and
floated
on
its
roof
like
a
boat
on
its
keel
but
when
things
of
that
sort
began
to
drift
past
the
too
bestirred
themselves
they
realized
now
that
the
river
had
overflowed
its
banks
somewhere
up
north
and
hurried
down
to
the
shores
with
poles
and
boat
hooks
to
haul
up
on
land
buildings
and
furniture
at
the
northern
end
of
the
parish
where
the
houses
were
scattered
and
people
were
scarce
ingmar
ingmarsson
alone
was
standing
on
the
bank
gazing
out
at
the
river
he
was
then
almost
sixty
and
looked
even
older
his
face
was
weatherbeaten
and
furrowed
his
figure
bent
he
appeared
to
be
as
awkward
and
helpless
as
ever
he
stood
leaning
on
a
long
heavy
boat
hook
his
dull
eyes
fixed
on
the
water
the
river
raged
and
foamed
arrogantly
marching
past
with
all
that
it
had
matched
from
the
shores
it
was
as
if
it
were
deriding
the
peasant
for
his
slowness
oh
you
not
the
one
to
wrest
from
me
any
of
the
things
i
carrying
away
it
seemed
to
say
ingmar
ingmarsson
made
no
attempt
to
rescue
any
of
the
floating
bridges
or
boat
hulls
that
passed
quite
close
to
the
bank
all
that
will
be
seen
to
down
at
the
village
he
thought
not
for
a
second
did
his
gaze
wander
from
the
river
he
took
note
of
everything
that
drifted
past
all
at
once
he
sighted
something
bright
and
yellow
floating
on
some
loosely
nailed
boards
quite
a
distance
up
the
river
ah
this
is
what
i
have
been
expecting
all
along
he
said
aloud
at
first
he
could
not
quite
make
out
what
the
yellow
was
but
for
one
who
knew
how
little
children
in
dalecarlia
are
dressed
it
was
easy
to
guess
those
must
be
youngsters
who
were
out
on
a
washing
pier
playing
he
said
and
had
the
sense
to
get
back
on
land
before
the
river
took
them
it
was
not
long
until
the
peasant
saw
that
he
had
guessed
rightly
now
he
could
distinctly
see
three
little
children
in
their
yellow
homespun
frocks
and
round
yellow
hats
being
carried
downstream
on
a
poorly
constructed
raft
that
was
being
slowly
torn
apart
by
the
swift
current
and
the
moving
ice
floes
the
children
were
still
a
long
way
off
big
ingmar
knew
there
was
a
bend
in
the
river
where
it
touched
his
land
if
god
in
his
mercy
would
only
direct
the
raft
with
the
children
into
this
current
he
thought
he
might
be
able
to
get
them
ashore
he
stood
very
still
watching
the
raft
all
at
once
it
seemed
as
if
some
one
had
given
it
a
push
it
swung
round
and
headed
straight
for
the
shore
by
that
time
the
children
were
so
close
that
he
could
see
their
frightened
little
faces
and
hear
their
cries
but
they
were
still
too
far
out
to
be
reached
by
the
boat
hook
from
the
bank
at
least
so
he
hurried
down
to
the
water
edge
and
waded
into
the
river
as
he
did
so
he
had
a
strange
sort
of
feeling
that
some
one
was
calling
to
him
to
comeback
you
are
no
longer
a
young
man
ingmar
this
may
prove
a
perilous
business
for
you
a
voice
said
to
him
he
reflected
a
moment
wondering
whether
he
had
the
right
to
risk
his
life
the
wife
whom
he
had
once
fetched
from
the
prison
had
died
during
the
winter
and
since
her
going
his
one
longing
had
been
that
he
might
soon
follow
but
on
the
other
hand
there
was
his
son
who
needed
a
father
care
for
he
was
only
a
little
lad
and
could
not
look
after
the
farm
in
any
case
it
must
be
as
god
wills
he
said
now
big
ingmar
was
no
longer
either
awkward
or
slow
as
he
plunged
into
the
raging
river
he
planted
his
boat
hook
firmly
into
the
bottom
so
as
not
to
be
carried
away
by
the
current
and
he
took
good
care
to
dodge
the
floating
ice
and
driftwood
when
the
raft
with
the
children
was
quite
near
he
pressed
his
feet
down
in
the
river
bed
thrust
out
his
boat
hook
and
got
a
purchase
on
it
hold
on
tight
he
shouted
to
the
children
for
just
then
the
raft
made
a
sudden
turn
and
all
its
planks
creaked
but
the
wretched
structure
held
together
and
big
ingmar
managed
to
pull
it
out
of
the
strongest
current
that
done
he
let
go
of
it
for
he
knew
that
the
raft
would
now
drift
shoreward
by
itself
touching
bottom
with
his
boat
hook
again
he
turned
to
go
back
to
the
bank
this
time
however
he
failed
to
notice
a
huge
log
that
was
coming
toward
him
with
a
rush
it
caught
him
in
the
side
just
below
the
armpit
it
was
a
terrific
blow
for
the
log
was
hurled
against
him
with
a
violent
force
that
sent
him
staggering
in
the
water
yet
he
kept
a
tight
grip
on
the
boat
hook
until
he
reached
the
bank
when
he
again
stood
on
firm
ground
he
hardly
dared
touch
his
body
for
he
felt
that
his
chest
had
been
crushed
then
his
mouth
suddenly
filled
with
blood
it
all
up
with
you
ingmar
he
thought
and
sank
down
on
the
bank
for
he
could
not
go
a
step
farther
the
little
children
whom
he
had
rescued
gave
the
alarm
and
soon
people
came
running
down
to
the
bank
and
big
ingmar
was
carried
home
the
pastor
was
called
in
and
he
remained
at
the
ingmar
farm
the
whole
afternoon
on
his
way
home
he
stopped
at
the
schoolmaster
he
had
experienced
things
in
the
course
of
the
day
which
he
felt
the
need
of
telling
to
some
one
who
would
understand
storm
and
mother
stina
were
deeply
grieved
for
they
had
already
heard
that
ingmar
ingmarsson
was
dead
the
clergyman
on
the
other
hand
looked
almost
radiant
as
he
stepped
into
the
kitchen
immediately
storm
asked
the
pastor
if
he
had
been
in
time
yes
he
said
but
on
this
occasion
i
was
not
needed
were
you
said
mother
stina
no
answered
the
pastor
with
a
mysterious
smile
he
would
have
got
on
just
as
well
without
me
sometimes
it
is
very
hard
to
sit
by
a
deathbed
he
added
it
is
indeed
nodded
the
schoolmaster
particularly
when
the
one
who
is
passing
from
among
us
happens
to
be
the
best
man
in
your
parish
just
so
but
things
can
also
be
quite
different
from
what
one
had
imagined
for
a
moment
the
pastor
sat
quietly
gazing
into
space
his
eyes
looked
clearer
than
usual
behind
the
spectacles
have
you
strong
or
you
mother
stina
ever
heard
of
the
wonderful
thing
that
once
happened
to
big
ingmar
when
he
was
a
young
man
he
asked
the
schoolmaster
said
that
he
had
heard
many
wonderful
things
about
him
why
of
course
but
this
is
the
most
wonderful
of
all
i
never
knew
of
it
myself
until
big
ingmar
had
a
good
friend
who
has
always
lived
in
a
little
cabin
on
his
estate
the
pastor
continued
yes
i
know
said
the
schoolmaster
he
is
also
named
ingmar
folks
call
him
strong
ingmar
by
way
of
distinction
true
said
the
pastor
his
father
named
him
ingmar
in
honour
of
the
master
family
one
saturday
evening
at
midsummer
when
the
nights
are
almost
as
light
as
the
days
big
ingmar
and
his
friend
strong
ingmar
after
finishing
their
work
put
on
their
sunday
clothes
and
went
down
to
the
village
in
quest
of
amusement
the
pastor
paused
a
moment
and
pondered
i
can
imagine
that
the
night
must
have
been
a
beautiful
one
he
went
on
clear
and
still
one
of
those
nights
when
earth
and
sky
seem
to
exchange
hues
the
sky
turning
a
bright
green
while
the
earth
becomes
veiled
in
white
mists
lending
to
everything
a
white
or
bluish
tinge
when
big
ingmar
and
strong
ingmar
were
crossing
the
bridge
to
the
village
it
was
as
if
some
one
had
told
them
to
stop
and
look
upward
they
did
so
and
they
saw
heaven
open
the
whole
firmament
had
been
drawn
back
to
right
and
left
like
a
pair
of
curtains
and
the
two
stood
there
hand
in
hand
and
beheld
all
the
glories
of
heaven
have
you
ever
heard
anything
like
it
mother
stina
or
you
storm
said
the
pastor
in
awed
tones
only
think
of
those
two
standing
on
the
bridge
and
seeing
heaven
open
but
what
they
saw
they
have
never
divulged
to
a
soul
sometimes
they
would
tell
a
child
or
a
kinsman
that
they
had
once
seen
heaven
open
but
they
never
spoke
of
it
to
outsiders
but
the
vision
lived
in
their
memories
as
their
greatest
treasure
their
holy
of
holies
the
pastor
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
i
have
never
before
heard
tell
of
such
things
his
voice
shook
a
little
as
he
proceeded
i
only
wish
i
had
stood
on
the
bridge
with
big
ingmar
and
strong
ingmar
and
seen
heaven
open
this
morning
immediately
after
big
ingmar
had
been
carried
home
he
requested
that
strong
ingmar
be
sent
for
at
once
a
messenger
was
dispatched
to
the
croft
to
fetch
him
only
to
find
that
strong
ingmar
was
not
at
home
he
was
in
the
forest
somewhere
chopping
firewood
and
was
not
easy
to
find
messenger
after
messenger
went
in
search
of
him
in
the
meantime
big
ingmar
felt
very
anxious
lest
he
should
not
get
to
see
his
old
friend
again
in
this
life
first
the
doctor
came
then
i
came
but
strong
ingmar
they
seem
to
find
big
ingmar
took
very
little
notice
of
us
he
was
sinking
fast
shall
soon
be
gone
parson
he
said
to
me
only
wish
i
might
see
strong
ingmar
before
i
go
he
was
lying
on
the
broad
bed
in
the
little
chamber
off
the
his
eyes
were
wide
open
and
he
seemed
to
be
looking
all
the
while
at
something
that
was
far
far
away
and
which
no
one
else
saw
the
three
little
children
he
had
rescued
sat
huddled
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
whenever
his
eyes
wandered
for
an
instant
from
that
which
he
saw
in
the
distance
they
rested
upon
the
children
and
then
his
whole
face
was
wreathed
in
smiles
at
last
they
had
succeeded
in
finding
the
crofter
big
ingmar
glanced
away
from
the
children
with
a
sigh
of
relief
when
he
heard
strong
ingmar
heavy
step
in
the
hallway
and
when
his
friend
came
over
to
the
bedside
he
took
his
hand
and
patted
it
gently
saying
you
remember
the
time
when
you
and
i
stood
on
the
bridge
and
saw
heaven
open
if
i
could
ever
forget
that
night
when
we
two
had
a
vision
of
paradise
strong
ingmar
responded
then
big
ingmar
turned
toward
him
his
face
beaming
as
if
he
had
the
most
glorious
news
to
impart
i
going
there
he
said
then
the
crofter
bent
over
him
and
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
shall
come
after
he
said
big
ingmar
nodded
you
know
i
can
not
come
before
your
son
returns
from
the
pilgrimage
yes
i
know
big
ingmar
whispered
then
he
drew
in
a
few
deep
breaths
and
before
we
knew
it
he
was
gone
the
schoolmaster
and
his
wife
thought
with
the
pastor
that
it
was
a
beautiful
death
all
three
of
them
sat
profoundly
silent
for
a
long
while
but
what
could
strong
ingmar
have
meant
asked
mother
stina
abruptly
when
he
spoke
of
the
pilgrimage
the
pastor
looked
up
somewhat
perplexed
i
do
know
he
replied
big
ingmar
died
just
after
that
was
said
and
i
have
not
had
time
to
ponder
it
he
fell
to
thinking
then
he
spoke
kind
of
half
to
himself
it
was
a
strange
sort
of
thing
to
say
right
about
that
mother
stina
you
know
of
course
that
it
has
been
said
of
strong
ingmar
that
he
can
see
into
the
future
she
said
reflectively
the
pastor
sat
stroking
his
forehead
in
an
effort
to
collect
his
thoughts
the
ways
of
providence
can
not
be
reasoned
out
by
the
finite
mind
he
mused
i
can
not
fathom
them
yet
seeking
to
know
them
is
the
most
satisfying
thing
in
all
the
world
karin
daughter
of
ingmar
autumn
had
come
and
school
was
again
open
one
morning
when
the
children
were
having
their
recess
the
schoolmaster
and
gertrude
went
into
the
kitchen
and
sat
down
at
the
table
where
mother
stina
served
them
with
coffee
before
they
had
finished
their
cups
a
visitor
arrived
the
caller
was
a
young
peasant
named
halvor
halvorsson
who
had
lately
opened
a
shop
in
the
village
he
came
from
tims
farm
and
was
familiarly
known
as
tims
halvor
he
was
a
tall
chap
who
appeared
to
be
somewhat
dejected
mother
stina
asked
him
also
to
have
some
coffee
so
he
sat
down
at
the
table
helped
himself
and
began
to
talk
to
the
schoolmaster
mother
stina
sat
by
the
window
knitting
from
where
she
was
seated
she
could
look
down
the
road
all
at
once
she
grew
red
in
the
face
and
leaned
forward
to
get
a
better
view
trying
to
appear
unconcerned
she
said
with
feigned
indifference
the
grand
folk
seem
to
be
out
walking
tims
halvor
thought
he
detected
a
certain
something
in
her
tone
that
sounded
a
bit
peculiar
and
he
got
up
and
looked
out
he
saw
a
tall
woman
and
a
boy
coming
toward
the
schoolhouse
unless
my
eyes
deceive
me
that
karin
daughter
of
ingmar
said
mother
stina
it
karin
all
right
tims
halvor
confirmed
he
said
nothing
more
but
turned
away
from
the
window
and
glanced
around
the
room
as
if
trying
to
discover
some
way
of
escape
but
in
a
moment
he
quietly
went
back
to
his
seat
the
summer
before
when
big
ingmar
was
still
alive
halvor
had
paid
court
to
karin
ingmarsson
the
courtship
had
been
a
long
one
with
many
ifs
and
buts
on
the
part
of
her
family
the
old
ingmars
were
not
quite
sure
that
he
was
good
enough
for
karin
it
had
not
been
a
question
of
money
for
halvor
was
his
father
however
had
been
addicted
to
drink
and
who
could
say
but
that
this
failing
had
been
transmitted
to
the
son
however
it
was
finally
decided
that
halvor
should
have
karin
the
wedding
day
was
fixed
and
they
had
asked
to
have
the
banns
published
but
before
the
day
set
for
the
first
reading
karin
and
halvor
made
a
journey
to
falun
to
purchase
the
wedding
ring
and
the
prayerbook
they
were
away
for
three
days
and
when
they
got
back
karin
told
her
father
that
she
could
not
marry
halvor
she
had
no
fault
to
find
with
him
save
that
on
one
occasion
he
had
taken
a
drop
too
much
and
she
feared
he
might
become
like
his
father
big
ingmar
then
said
that
he
would
not
try
to
influence
her
against
her
better
judgment
so
halvor
was
dismissed
and
the
engagement
was
off
halvor
took
it
very
much
to
heart
you
are
heaping
upon
me
shame
that
will
be
hard
to
bear
he
said
what
will
people
think
if
you
throw
me
over
in
this
way
it
is
fair
to
treat
a
decent
man
like
that
but
karin
was
not
to
be
moved
and
ever
since
halvor
had
been
morose
and
unhappy
he
could
not
forget
the
injustice
that
had
been
done
him
by
the
ingmarssons
and
here
sat
halvor
and
there
came
karin
what
would
happen
next
this
much
was
certain
a
reconciliation
was
out
of
the
question
since
the
previous
autumn
karin
had
been
married
to
one
elof
ersson
she
and
her
husband
lived
at
the
ingmar
farm
which
they
had
been
running
since
the
death
of
big
ingmar
in
the
spring
big
ingmar
had
left
five
daughters
and
one
son
but
the
son
was
too
young
to
take
over
the
property
meanwhile
karin
had
come
in
she
was
only
about
two
and
twenty
but
was
one
of
those
women
who
never
look
real
young
most
people
thought
her
exceedingly
plain
for
she
favoured
her
father
family
and
had
their
heavy
eyelids
their
sandy
hair
and
hard
lines
about
the
mouth
but
the
schoolmaster
and
his
wife
were
pleased
to
think
that
she
bore
such
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
old
ingmars
when
karin
saw
halvor
her
face
did
not
change
she
moved
about
slowly
and
quietly
and
greeted
each
of
them
in
turn
when
she
offered
her
hand
to
halvor
he
put
out
his
and
they
barely
touched
each
other
with
the
tips
of
their
fingers
karin
always
stooped
a
little
and
as
she
stood
before
halvor
with
head
bowed
she
seemed
to
be
more
bent
than
usual
while
halvor
looked
taller
and
straighter
than
ever
so
karin
has
really
ventured
out
said
mother
stina
drawing
up
the
pastor
chair
for
her
yes
she
answered
it
easy
walking
now
that
the
frost
has
set
in
there
has
been
a
hard
frost
during
the
night
the
schoolmaster
put
in
this
was
followed
by
a
dead
silence
which
lasted
several
minutes
presently
halvor
got
up
and
the
others
started
as
if
suddenly
awakened
from
a
sound
sleep
i
must
get
back
to
the
shop
said
halvor
what
your
hurry
asked
mother
stina
i
hope
halvor
is
going
on
my
account
said
karin
meekly
as
soon
as
halvor
was
gone
the
tension
was
broken
and
the
schoolmaster
knew
at
once
what
to
say
he
looked
at
the
lad
karin
had
brought
with
her
and
of
whom
no
one
had
taken
any
notice
before
he
was
a
little
chap
who
could
not
have
been
much
older
than
gertrude
he
had
a
fair
soft
baby
face
yet
there
was
something
about
him
that
made
him
appear
old
for
his
years
it
was
easy
to
tell
to
what
family
he
belonged
i
think
karin
has
brought
us
a
new
pupil
said
storm
this
is
my
brother
karin
replied
he
is
the
present
ingmar
ingmarsson
he
rather
little
for
that
name
storm
remarked
yes
father
died
too
soon
he
did
indeed
said
the
schoolmaster
and
his
wife
both
in
the
same
breath
he
has
been
attending
the
school
in
falun
karin
explained
that
why
he
has
been
here
before
are
you
going
to
let
him
go
back
this
year
too
karin
dropped
her
eyes
and
a
sigh
escaped
her
he
has
the
name
of
being
a
good
student
she
said
evading
his
question
i
only
afraid
that
i
ca
teach
him
anything
he
must
know
as
much
as
i
do
well
i
guess
the
schoolmaster
knows
a
good
deal
more
than
a
little
chap
like
him
then
came
another
pause
after
which
karin
continued
this
is
not
only
the
question
of
his
attending
school
but
i
would
also
like
to
ask
whether
you
and
mother
stina
would
let
the
boy
come
here
to
live
the
schoolmaster
and
his
wife
looked
at
each
other
in
astonishment
but
neither
of
them
was
prepared
to
answer
i
fear
our
quarters
are
rather
close
said
storm
presently
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
might
be
willing
to
accept
milk
and
butter
and
eggs
as
part
payment
as
to
that
you
would
be
doing
me
a
great
service
said
the
rich
peasant
woman
mother
stina
felt
that
karin
would
never
have
made
this
singular
request
had
there
not
been
some
good
reason
for
it
so
she
promptly
settled
the
matter
karin
need
say
no
more
we
will
do
all
that
we
can
for
the
ingmarssons
thank
you
said
karin
the
two
women
talked
over
what
had
best
be
done
for
welfare
meantime
storm
took
the
boy
with
him
to
the
classroom
and
gave
him
a
seat
next
to
gertrude
during
the
whole
of
the
first
day
ingmar
never
said
a
word
tims
halvor
did
not
go
near
the
schoolhouse
again
for
a
week
or
more
it
was
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
again
meeting
karin
there
but
one
morning
when
it
rained
in
torrents
and
there
was
no
likelihood
of
any
customers
coming
he
decided
to
run
over
and
have
a
chat
with
mother
stina
he
was
hungry
for
a
talk
with
some
kindly
and
sympathetic
person
he
had
been
seized
by
a
terrible
fit
of
the
blues
i
no
good
and
no
one
has
any
respect
for
me
he
murmured
tormenting
himself
as
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
ever
since
karin
had
thrown
him
over
he
closed
his
shop
buttoned
his
storm
coat
and
went
on
his
way
to
the
school
through
wind
and
rain
and
slush
halvor
was
happy
to
be
back
once
more
in
the
friendly
atmosphere
of
the
schoolhouse
and
was
still
there
when
the
recess
bell
rang
and
storm
and
the
two
children
came
in
for
their
coffee
all
three
went
over
to
greet
him
he
arose
to
shake
hands
with
the
schoolmaster
but
when
little
ingmar
put
out
his
hand
halvor
was
talking
so
earnestly
to
mother
stina
that
he
seemed
not
to
have
noticed
the
boy
ingmar
remained
standing
a
moment
then
he
went
up
to
the
table
and
sat
down
he
sighed
several
times
just
as
karin
had
done
the
day
she
was
there
halvor
has
come
to
show
us
his
new
watch
said
mother
stina
whereupon
halvor
took
from
his
pocket
a
new
silver
watch
which
he
showed
to
them
it
was
a
pretty
little
timepiece
with
a
flower
design
engraved
on
the
case
the
schoolmaster
opened
it
went
into
the
schoolroom
for
a
magnifying
glass
adjusted
it
to
his
eye
and
began
examining
the
works
he
seemed
quite
carried
away
as
he
studied
the
delicate
adjustment
of
the
tiny
wheels
and
said
he
had
never
seen
finer
workmanship
finally
he
gave
the
watch
back
to
halvor
who
put
it
in
his
pocket
looking
neither
pleased
nor
proud
as
folks
generally
do
when
you
praise
their
purchases
ingmar
was
silent
during
the
meal
but
when
he
had
finished
his
coffee
he
asked
storm
whether
he
really
knew
anything
about
watches
why
of
course
returned
the
schoolmaster
do
you
know
that
i
understand
a
little
of
everything
ingmar
then
brought
out
a
watch
which
he
carried
in
his
vest
pocket
it
was
a
big
round
silver
that
looked
ugly
and
clumsy
as
compared
with
halvor
watch
the
chain
to
which
it
was
attached
was
also
a
clumsy
contrivance
the
case
was
quite
plain
and
dented
it
was
not
much
of
a
watch
it
had
no
crystal
and
the
enamel
on
its
face
was
cracked
it
has
stopped
said
storm
putting
the
watch
to
his
ear
yes
i
stammered
the
boy
i
was
just
wondering
if
you
did
think
it
could
be
mended
storm
opened
it
and
found
that
all
the
wheels
were
loose
you
must
have
been
hammering
nails
with
this
watch
he
said
i
ca
do
anything
with
it
do
you
think
that
eric
the
clockmaker
could
fix
it
no
no
more
than
i
you
better
send
it
to
falun
and
have
new
works
put
in
i
thought
so
said
ingmar
and
took
the
watch
for
heaven
sake
what
have
you
been
doing
with
it
the
schoolmaster
exclaimed
the
boy
swallowed
hard
it
was
father
watch
he
explained
and
it
got
damaged
like
that
when
father
was
struck
by
the
whirling
log
now
they
all
grew
interested
with
an
effort
to
control
his
feelings
ingmar
continued
as
you
know
it
happened
during
holy
week
when
i
was
at
home
i
was
the
first
person
to
reach
father
when
he
lay
on
the
bank
i
found
him
with
the
watch
in
his
hand
it
all
over
with
me
ingmar
he
said
sorry
the
watch
is
broken
for
i
want
you
to
give
it
with
my
greetings
to
some
one
that
i
have
wronged
then
he
told
me
who
was
to
have
the
watch
and
bade
me
take
it
along
to
falun
and
have
it
repaired
before
presenting
it
but
i
never
went
back
to
falun
and
now
i
do
know
what
to
do
about
it
the
schoolmaster
was
wondering
whether
he
knew
of
any
one
who
was
soon
going
to
the
city
when
mother
stina
turned
to
the
boy
who
was
to
have
the
watch
ingmar
she
asked
i
do
know
as
i
ought
to
tell
the
boy
demurred
was
it
tims
halvor
who
is
sitting
here
yes
he
whispered
then
give
halvor
the
watch
just
as
it
is
said
mother
stina
that
will
please
him
best
ingmar
obediently
rose
took
out
the
watch
and
rubbed
it
in
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
to
shine
it
up
a
bit
then
he
went
over
to
halvor
father
asked
me
to
give
you
this
with
his
compliments
he
said
holding
out
the
watch
all
this
while
halvor
had
sat
there
silent
and
glum
and
when
the
boy
went
over
to
him
he
put
his
hand
up
to
his
eyes
as
if
he
did
not
want
to
look
at
him
ingmar
stood
a
long
time
holding
out
the
watch
finally
he
glanced
appealingly
at
mother
stina
blessed
are
the
peacemakers
she
said
then
storm
put
in
a
word
i
do
thick
you
could
ask
for
a
better
amend
halvor
he
said
i
always
maintained
that
if
ingmar
ingmarsson
had
lived
he
would
have
given
you
full
justice
long
before
this
the
next
they
saw
was
halvor
reaching
out
for
the
watch
almost
as
if
against
his
will
but
the
moment
he
had
got
it
into
his
hand
he
put
it
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
vest
there
no
fear
of
any
one
taking
that
watch
from
him
said
the
schoolmaster
with
a
laugh
as
he
saw
halvor
carefully
buttoning
his
coat
and
halvor
laughed
too
presently
he
got
up
straightened
himself
and
drew
a
deep
breath
the
colour
came
into
his
cheeks
and
his
eyes
shone
with
a
happiness
now
halvor
must
feel
like
a
new
man
said
the
wife
then
halvor
put
his
hand
inside
his
overcoat
and
drew
out
his
watch
crossing
over
to
ingmar
who
was
again
seated
at
the
table
he
said
since
i
have
taken
your
father
watch
from
you
you
must
accept
this
one
from
me
he
laid
the
watch
on
the
table
and
went
out
without
even
saying
the
rest
of
the
day
he
tramped
the
roads
and
bypaths
a
couple
of
peasants
who
had
come
from
a
distance
to
trade
with
him
hung
around
outside
the
shop
from
noon
till
evening
but
no
tims
halvor
appeared
elof
ersson
the
husband
of
karin
ingmarsson
was
the
son
of
a
cruel
and
avaricious
peasant
who
had
always
treated
him
harshly
as
a
child
he
had
been
half
starved
and
even
after
he
was
grown
up
his
father
kept
him
under
his
thumb
he
had
to
toil
and
slave
from
morning
till
night
and
was
never
allowed
any
pleasures
he
was
not
even
allowed
to
attend
the
country
dances
like
other
young
folk
and
he
got
no
rest
from
his
work
even
on
sundays
nor
did
elof
become
his
own
master
when
he
married
he
had
to
live
at
the
ingmar
farm
and
be
under
the
domination
of
his
and
also
at
the
ingmar
farm
hard
work
and
frugality
were
the
rule
of
the
day
as
long
as
ingmar
ingmarsson
lived
elof
seemed
quite
content
with
his
lot
toiling
and
slaving
with
never
so
much
as
a
complaint
folks
used
to
say
that
now
the
ingmarssons
had
got
a
after
their
own
hearts
for
elof
ersson
did
not
know
that
there
was
anything
else
in
life
than
just
toil
and
drudgery
but
as
soon
as
big
ingmar
was
dead
and
buried
elof
began
to
drink
and
carouse
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
all
the
rounders
in
the
parish
and
invited
them
down
to
the
farm
and
went
with
them
to
dance
halls
and
taverns
he
quit
work
altogether
and
drank
himself
full
every
day
in
the
space
of
two
short
months
he
became
a
poor
drunken
wretch
the
first
time
karin
saw
him
in
a
state
of
intoxication
she
was
horrified
this
is
god
judgment
upon
me
for
my
treatment
of
halvor
was
the
thought
that
came
to
her
to
the
husband
she
said
very
little
in
the
way
of
rebuke
or
warning
she
soon
perceived
that
he
was
like
a
blasted
tree
doomed
to
wither
and
decay
and
she
could
not
hope
for
either
help
or
protection
from
him
but
karin
sisters
were
not
so
wise
as
she
was
they
resented
his
escapades
blushed
at
his
ribald
songs
and
coarse
jokes
by
turns
threatening
and
admonishing
him
and
although
their
was
on
the
whole
rather
he
sometimes
got
into
a
rage
and
had
words
with
them
then
karin
only
thought
was
how
she
should
get
her
sisters
away
from
the
house
that
they
might
escape
the
misery
in
which
she
herself
had
to
live
in
the
course
of
the
summer
she
managed
to
marry
off
the
two
older
girls
and
the
two
younger
ones
she
sent
to
america
where
they
had
relatives
who
were
all
the
sisters
received
their
proportion
of
the
inheritance
which
amounted
to
twenty
thousand
kroner
each
the
farm
had
been
left
to
karin
with
the
understanding
that
young
ingmar
was
to
take
it
over
when
he
became
of
age
it
seemed
remarkable
that
karin
who
was
so
awkward
and
diffident
should
have
been
able
to
send
so
many
birds
from
the
nest
find
mates
for
them
and
homes
she
arranged
it
all
herself
for
she
could
get
no
help
whatever
from
her
husband
who
had
now
become
utterly
worthless
her
greatest
concern
however
was
the
little
brother
he
who
was
now
ingmar
ingmarsson
the
boy
exasperated
karin
husband
even
more
than
the
sisters
had
done
he
did
it
by
actions
rather
than
words
one
time
he
poured
out
all
the
corn
brandy
elof
had
brought
home
another
time
the
caught
him
in
the
act
of
diluting
his
liquor
with
water
when
autumn
came
karin
demanded
that
the
boy
be
sent
back
to
high
school
that
year
as
in
former
years
but
her
husband
who
was
also
his
guardian
would
not
hear
of
it
ingmar
shall
be
a
farmer
like
his
father
and
me
and
my
father
said
elof
what
business
has
he
at
high
school
when
the
winter
comes
he
and
i
will
go
into
the
forest
to
put
up
charcoal
kilns
that
will
be
the
best
kind
of
schooling
for
him
when
i
was
his
age
i
spent
a
whole
winter
working
at
the
kiln
as
karin
could
not
induce
him
to
alter
his
mind
she
had
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
keep
ingmar
at
home
for
the
time
being
elof
then
tried
to
win
the
confidence
of
little
ingmar
whenever
he
went
anywhere
he
always
wanted
the
boy
to
accompany
him
the
lad
went
of
course
but
unwillingly
he
did
not
like
to
go
with
him
on
his
sprees
then
elof
would
coax
the
boy
and
vow
that
he
was
not
going
any
farther
than
the
church
or
the
shop
but
when
once
he
got
ingmar
in
the
cart
he
would
drive
off
with
him
down
to
the
smithies
at
bergsana
or
the
tavern
in
karmsund
karin
was
glad
that
her
husband
took
the
boy
along
it
was
at
least
a
safeguard
against
elof
being
left
in
a
ditch
by
the
roadside
or
driving
the
horse
to
death
once
when
elof
came
home
at
eight
in
the
morning
ingmar
was
sitting
beside
him
in
the
cart
fast
asleep
come
out
here
and
look
after
the
boy
elof
shouted
to
karin
and
carry
him
in
the
poor
brat
as
full
as
a
tick
and
ca
walk
a
step
karin
was
so
shocked
that
she
almost
collapsed
she
was
obliged
to
sit
down
on
the
steps
for
a
moment
to
recover
herself
before
she
could
lift
the
boy
the
minute
she
took
hold
of
him
she
discovered
that
he
was
not
really
asleep
but
stiff
from
the
cold
and
unconscious
taking
the
boy
in
her
arms
she
carried
him
into
the
bedroom
locked
the
door
after
her
and
tried
to
bring
him
to
after
a
while
she
stepped
into
the
where
elof
sat
eating
his
breakfast
she
walked
straight
up
to
him
and
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
better
lay
in
a
good
meal
while
you
about
it
she
said
for
if
you
have
made
my
brother
drink
himself
to
death
soon
have
to
put
up
with
poorer
fare
than
you
getting
on
the
ingmar
farm
how
you
talk
as
if
a
little
brandy
could
hurt
him
mark
what
i
say
if
the
boy
dies
you
get
twenty
years
in
prison
elof
when
karin
returned
to
the
bedroom
the
boy
had
come
out
of
his
stupor
but
was
delirious
and
unable
to
move
hand
or
foot
he
suffered
agonies
do
you
think
i
going
to
die
karin
he
moaned
no
dear
of
course
not
karin
assured
him
i
did
know
what
they
were
giving
me
thank
god
for
that
said
karin
fervently
if
i
die
write
to
my
sisters
and
tell
them
i
did
know
it
was
liquor
wailed
the
boy
yes
dear
soothed
karin
really
and
truly
i
did
know
i
swear
it
all
day
ingmar
lay
in
a
raging
fever
please
do
tell
father
about
it
he
raved
father
will
never
know
of
it
she
said
but
suppose
i
die
then
father
would
surely
find
it
out
and
i
would
be
shamed
before
him
but
it
was
your
fault
child
maybe
father
will
think
that
i
should
have
taken
what
elof
offered
me
do
you
suppose
the
whole
parish
must
know
that
i
have
been
full
he
asked
what
do
the
hired
men
say
and
what
does
old
lisa
say
and
strong
ingmar
they
not
saying
anything
karin
replied
you
will
have
to
tell
them
how
it
happened
we
were
at
the
tavern
in
karmsund
where
elof
and
some
of
his
pals
had
been
drinking
the
whole
night
i
was
sitting
in
a
corner
on
a
bench
half
asleep
when
elof
came
over
and
roused
me
up
ingmar
he
said
very
pleasantly
i
give
you
something
that
will
make
you
warm
drink
this
he
urged
holding
a
glass
to
my
lips
only
hot
water
with
a
little
sugar
in
it
i
was
shivering
with
the
cold
when
i
awoke
and
as
i
drank
the
stuff
i
only
noticed
that
it
was
hot
and
sweet
but
he
had
gone
and
mixed
something
strong
with
it
oh
what
will
father
say
then
karin
opened
the
door
leading
to
the
where
elof
still
lingered
over
his
meal
she
felt
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
hear
this
if
only
father
were
living
karin
if
only
father
were
living
what
then
ingmar
do
you
think
he
kill
him
elof
broke
into
a
loud
laugh
and
when
the
boy
heard
him
he
turned
so
pale
with
fright
that
karin
promptly
closed
the
door
again
it
had
this
good
effect
upon
elof
at
all
events
he
put
up
no
objection
when
karin
decided
to
take
the
boy
to
storm
school
soon
after
halvor
had
received
the
watch
his
shop
was
always
full
of
people
every
farmer
in
the
parish
when
in
town
would
stop
at
halvor
shop
in
order
to
hear
the
story
of
big
ingmar
watch
the
peasants
in
their
long
white
fur
coats
stood
hanging
over
the
counter
by
the
hour
their
solemn
furrowed
faces
turned
toward
halvor
as
he
talked
to
them
sometimes
he
would
take
out
the
watch
and
show
them
the
dented
case
and
the
cracked
face
so
it
was
there
the
blow
caught
him
the
peasants
would
say
and
they
seemed
to
see
before
them
what
had
happened
when
big
ingmar
was
hurt
it
is
a
great
thing
for
you
halvor
to
have
that
watch
when
halvor
was
showing
the
watch
he
would
never
let
it
out
of
his
hands
but
would
always
keep
a
tight
grip
on
the
chain
one
day
halvor
stood
talking
to
a
group
of
peasants
telling
them
the
usual
story
and
at
the
climax
the
watch
was
of
course
brought
out
as
it
was
being
passed
from
one
to
the
other
he
holding
the
chain
there
fell
upon
all
a
solemn
hush
in
the
meantime
elof
had
come
into
the
shop
but
as
every
one
attention
was
riveted
upon
the
watch
no
one
had
remarked
his
presence
elof
had
also
heard
the
story
of
his
watch
and
knew
at
once
what
was
going
on
he
did
not
begrudge
halvor
his
souvenir
he
was
simply
amused
at
the
sight
of
him
and
the
others
standing
there
looking
so
solemn
over
nothing
but
an
old
and
battered
silver
watch
elof
stole
quietly
up
behind
the
men
reached
over
and
snatched
the
watch
from
halvor
it
was
only
meant
in
fun
he
had
no
thought
of
taking
the
watch
only
from
halvor
he
just
wanted
to
tease
him
a
bit
when
halvor
tried
to
snatch
it
again
elof
stepped
back
and
held
it
up
as
if
he
were
holding
out
a
lump
of
sugar
to
a
dog
then
halvor
vaulted
the
counter
and
he
looked
so
angry
that
elof
got
frightened
and
instead
of
standing
still
and
handing
him
back
the
watch
he
ran
for
the
door
outside
were
some
badly
worn
wooden
steps
elof
foot
caught
in
a
hole
and
down
he
went
halvor
fell
upon
him
seized
the
watch
then
gave
him
several
hard
kicks
you
better
quit
kicking
me
and
find
out
what
wrong
with
my
back
said
elof
halvor
stopped
at
once
but
elof
made
no
move
to
raise
himself
help
me
up
he
said
you
can
help
yourself
when
you
slept
off
your
jag
i
not
full
elof
protested
the
fact
is
as
i
started
to
run
down
the
stairs
i
thought
i
saw
big
ingmar
coming
toward
me
to
take
the
watch
that
how
i
got
such
an
ugly
fall
then
halvor
bent
down
and
gave
the
poor
wretch
a
lift
for
his
back
was
broken
he
had
to
be
put
into
a
wagon
and
driven
home
he
would
never
again
have
the
use
of
his
legs
from
that
time
forth
elof
was
confined
to
his
bed
a
helpless
cripple
but
he
could
talk
and
all
day
long
he
kept
begging
for
brandy
the
doctor
had
left
strict
orders
with
karin
not
to
give
him
any
spirits
lest
he
drink
himself
to
death
then
elof
tried
to
get
what
he
wanted
by
shrieking
and
making
the
most
hideous
noises
especially
at
night
he
behaved
like
a
madman
and
disturbed
every
one
rest
that
was
karin
most
trying
year
her
husband
sometimes
tormented
her
until
it
seemed
as
though
she
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
the
very
air
became
polluted
by
his
vile
talk
and
profanity
so
that
the
home
was
like
a
hell
karin
begged
the
storms
to
keep
little
ingmar
with
them
also
during
the
holidays
she
did
not
want
her
brother
to
be
at
home
with
her
for
a
day
not
even
at
christmas
all
the
servants
at
the
ingmar
farm
were
distantly
related
to
the
family
and
had
always
lived
on
the
place
but
for
the
feeling
that
they
belonged
to
the
ingmarssons
they
could
not
have
gone
on
serving
under
such
conditions
there
were
precious
few
nights
that
they
were
allowed
to
sleep
in
peace
elof
was
constantly
hitting
upon
new
ways
of
tormenting
both
the
servants
and
karin
to
make
them
give
in
to
his
demands
in
this
misery
karin
passed
a
winter
and
a
summer
and
another
winter
but
karin
had
a
retreat
to
which
she
would
flee
at
times
in
order
to
be
alone
with
her
thoughts
behind
the
hop
garden
there
was
a
narrow
seat
upon
which
she
often
sat
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
chin
resting
in
her
hands
staring
straight
ahead
yet
seeing
nothing
fronting
her
were
great
stretches
of
cornfields
beyond
which
was
the
forest
and
in
the
distance
the
range
of
hills
and
mount
klack
one
evening
in
april
she
sat
on
her
bench
feeling
tired
and
listless
as
one
often
does
in
the
springtime
when
the
snow
turns
to
slush
and
the
ground
is
still
unwashed
by
spring
rains
the
hops
lay
sleeping
under
a
cover
of
fir
brush
over
against
the
hills
hung
a
thick
mist
such
as
always
accompanies
a
thaw
the
birch
tops
were
beginning
to
turn
brown
but
all
along
the
skirt
of
the
forest
there
was
still
a
deep
border
of
snow
spring
would
soon
be
there
in
earnest
and
the
thought
of
it
made
her
feel
even
more
tired
she
felt
that
she
could
never
live
through
another
summer
like
the
last
one
she
thought
of
all
the
work
ahead
of
her
sowing
and
haymaking
spring
baking
and
spring
cleaning
weaving
and
sewing
and
wondered
how
she
would
ever
get
through
with
it
all
i
might
better
be
dead
she
sighed
i
seem
to
be
here
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
prevent
elof
killing
himself
with
drink
suddenly
she
looked
up
as
if
she
had
heard
some
one
calling
her
leaning
against
the
hedge
looking
straight
at
her
stood
halvor
halvorsson
she
did
not
know
just
when
he
had
come
but
apparently
he
had
been
standing
there
a
good
while
i
thought
i
should
find
you
over
here
halvor
said
oh
did
you
i
remembered
how
in
days
gone
by
you
used
to
step
away
and
come
here
to
sit
and
brood
i
did
have
much
to
brood
over
at
that
time
then
your
troubles
were
mostly
imaginary
karin
mused
as
she
looked
at
halvor
he
must
be
thinking
what
a
fool
i
was
not
to
have
married
him
who
is
such
a
handsome
and
dignified
man
now
he
got
me
where
he
can
crow
over
me
and
he
has
come
only
to
laugh
at
me
i
been
inside
talking
with
elof
halvor
enlightened
it
was
really
him
i
wanted
to
see
karin
made
no
reply
but
sat
there
frigid
and
unresponsive
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
and
her
hands
crossed
prepared
to
meet
all
the
scorn
she
fancied
halvor
would
now
heap
upon
her
i
said
to
him
halvor
continued
that
i
considered
myself
largely
to
blame
for
his
misfortune
since
it
was
at
my
place
that
he
got
hurt
he
paused
a
moment
as
if
waiting
for
some
expression
from
her
either
of
approval
or
disapproval
but
karin
was
silent
so
i
have
asked
him
to
come
and
live
with
me
for
a
while
it
would
at
least
be
a
change
and
he
could
see
more
people
than
he
meets
here
then
karin
raised
her
eyes
but
otherwise
remained
as
motionless
as
before
we
have
arranged
to
have
him
sent
to
my
place
morning
i
know
he
come
because
he
thinks
he
can
get
his
liquor
but
of
course
you
must
know
karin
that
that
out
of
the
question
no
indeed
it
no
more
to
be
had
with
me
than
with
you
i
shall
expect
him
he
is
to
occupy
the
little
room
off
the
shop
and
i
promised
him
that
i
let
his
door
stand
open
so
that
he
may
see
all
persons
who
come
and
go
at
halvor
first
words
karin
wondered
whether
this
was
not
something
he
had
made
up
but
gradually
it
dawned
on
her
that
he
was
in
earnest
as
a
matter
of
fact
karin
had
always
imagined
that
halvor
had
courted
her
only
because
of
her
money
and
good
connections
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
he
might
have
loved
her
for
herself
alone
she
probably
knew
she
was
not
the
kind
of
girl
that
men
care
for
nor
had
she
herself
been
in
love
either
with
halvor
or
elof
but
now
that
halvor
had
come
to
her
in
her
trouble
and
wanted
to
help
her
she
was
completely
overwhelmed
by
the
bigness
of
the
man
she
marvelled
that
he
could
be
so
kind
she
felt
that
surely
he
must
like
her
a
little
since
he
had
come
like
that
to
help
her
karin
heart
began
to
beat
violently
and
anxiously
she
awoke
to
something
she
had
never
before
experienced
and
wondered
what
it
meant
then
all
at
once
she
realized
that
halvor
kindness
had
thawed
her
frozen
heart
and
that
love
was
beginning
to
flame
up
in
her
halvor
went
on
unfolding
his
plan
fearing
all
the
while
that
she
might
oppose
him
it
hard
for
elof
too
he
pleaded
he
needs
a
change
of
scene
and
he
wo
make
as
much
trouble
for
me
as
he
has
made
for
you
it
will
be
quite
different
when
he
got
a
man
to
reckon
with
karin
hardly
knew
what
she
should
do
she
felt
that
she
could
not
make
a
movement
or
say
a
word
without
letting
halvor
see
that
she
was
in
love
with
him
yet
she
knew
she
would
have
to
give
him
some
kind
of
an
answer
presently
halvor
stopped
talking
and
simply
looked
at
her
then
karin
rose
involuntarily
went
up
to
him
and
patted
him
on
the
hand
god
bless
you
halvor
she
said
in
broken
tones
god
bless
you
despite
all
her
precautions
halvor
must
have
divined
something
for
he
quickly
grasped
her
hands
and
drew
her
to
him
no
no
she
cried
in
alarm
freeing
herself
then
she
hurried
away
elof
had
gone
to
live
with
halvor
all
summer
he
lay
in
the
little
bedroom
off
the
shop
halvor
was
not
troubled
with
the
care
of
him
for
a
great
while
for
in
the
autumn
he
died
shortly
after
his
death
mother
stina
said
to
halvor
now
you
must
promise
me
one
thing
promise
me
that
you
will
exercise
patience
as
regards
karin
of
course
i
have
patience
halvor
returned
wonderingly
she
somebody
worth
winning
even
if
one
has
to
wait
seven
long
years
but
it
was
not
so
easy
for
halvor
to
have
patience
for
he
soon
learned
that
this
one
and
that
one
was
paying
court
to
karin
this
began
within
a
fortnight
of
elof
funeral
one
sunday
afternoon
halvor
sat
on
the
steps
in
front
of
his
shop
watching
the
people
coming
and
going
presently
it
occurred
to
him
that
an
unusual
number
of
fine
rigs
were
moving
in
the
direction
of
the
ingmar
farm
in
the
first
carriage
sat
an
inspector
from
bergsana
foundry
in
the
second
was
the
son
of
the
proprietor
of
the
karmsund
inn
and
last
came
the
magistrate
berger
sven
persson
who
was
the
richest
man
in
western
dalecarlia
and
a
sensible
and
highly
esteemed
man
too
he
was
not
young
to
be
sure
he
had
been
twice
married
and
was
now
a
widower
for
the
second
time
when
halvor
saw
berger
sven
persson
driving
by
he
could
not
contain
himself
any
longer
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
started
down
the
road
in
almost
no
time
he
was
over
the
bridge
and
on
the
side
of
the
river
where
the
ingmar
farm
lay
i
like
to
know
where
all
those
carriages
have
gone
to
he
said
to
himself
he
followed
the
wheel
ruts
half
running
but
all
the
while
becoming
more
and
more
determined
i
know
this
is
stupid
of
me
he
thought
remembering
mother
stina
warning
but
i
only
going
as
far
as
the
gate
to
see
what
they
up
to
down
there
in
the
best
room
at
the
ingmars
sat
berger
sven
persson
and
two
other
men
drinking
coffee
ingmar
ingmarsson
who
still
lived
at
the
schoolhouse
was
at
home
over
sunday
he
sat
at
table
with
them
and
acted
as
host
for
karin
had
excused
herself
saying
she
had
some
work
to
do
in
the
kitchen
as
the
maids
had
gone
down
to
the
mission
house
to
hear
the
schoolmaster
preach
it
was
deadly
dull
in
the
parlour
all
the
men
sat
drinking
their
coffee
without
exchanging
a
word
the
suitors
were
practically
strangers
to
one
another
and
all
three
of
them
were
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
slip
into
the
kitchen
for
a
private
word
with
karin
presently
the
door
opened
and
in
stepped
another
caller
who
was
received
by
ingmar
and
conducted
to
the
table
this
is
tims
halvor
halvorsson
said
ingmar
introducing
the
newcomer
to
berger
sven
persson
sven
persson
did
not
rise
but
greeted
halvor
with
a
sweep
of
the
hand
saying
somewhat
facetiously
it
is
a
pleasure
to
meet
so
distinguished
a
personage
ingmar
noisily
drew
up
a
chair
for
halvor
so
that
he
was
spared
the
embarrassment
of
replying
from
the
moment
halvor
entered
the
room
all
the
suitors
became
chatty
and
began
to
talk
big
each
in
turn
praised
and
championed
the
others
it
was
as
if
they
had
all
agreed
among
themselves
to
stand
together
until
halvor
was
well
out
of
the
game
the
magistrate
is
driving
a
fine
horse
the
inspector
began
berger
sven
persson
took
up
the
fun
by
complimenting
the
inspector
on
having
shot
a
bear
the
winter
before
then
the
two
turned
to
the
innkeeper
son
and
said
something
in
praise
of
a
house
his
father
was
building
finally
all
three
of
them
bragged
about
the
wealth
of
bergen
sven
persson
they
waxed
eloquent
and
with
every
word
they
gave
halvor
to
understand
that
he
was
too
lowly
a
man
to
think
of
pitting
himself
against
them
and
halvor
certainly
did
feel
very
insignificant
and
bitterly
regretted
having
come
just
then
karin
came
along
with
fresh
coffee
at
sight
of
halvor
she
brightened
for
an
instant
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
his
calling
on
her
so
soon
after
her
husband
death
looked
rather
bad
if
he
is
in
such
a
hurry
people
will
surely
say
that
he
given
elof
proper
care
and
that
he
wanted
him
out
of
the
way
so
he
could
marry
me
she
would
rather
he
had
waited
two
or
three
years
before
coming
that
would
have
been
long
enough
to
make
folks
see
that
he
had
not
been
impatient
for
elof
departure
why
need
he
be
in
such
haste
she
wondered
surely
he
must
know
that
i
want
anyone
but
him
every
one
had
stopped
talking
the
moment
karin
appeared
wondering
how
she
and
halvor
would
greet
each
other
they
barely
touched
hands
which
the
magistrate
expressed
his
delight
by
a
short
whistle
while
the
inspector
broke
into
a
loud
guffaw
haldor
quietly
turned
to
him
what
are
you
laughing
at
he
said
the
inspector
was
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
with
karin
there
he
did
not
wish
to
say
anything
that
might
give
offence
he
is
thinking
of
a
hound
that
raises
a
hare
and
allows
some
one
else
to
catch
it
remarked
the
innkeeper
son
insinuatingly
karin
turned
blood
red
but
refilled
the
coffee
cups
berger
sven
persson
and
the
rest
of
you
will
have
to
be
satisfied
with
plain
coffee
she
said
we
no
longer
serve
spirits
to
any
one
on
this
farm
nor
do
i
at
my
home
said
the
magistrate
approvingly
the
inspector
and
the
innkeeper
son
kept
quiet
they
understood
that
sven
persson
had
scored
heavily
the
magistrate
straightway
began
to
discourse
on
temperance
and
its
salutary
effects
karin
listened
to
him
with
interest
and
agreed
with
all
that
he
said
seeing
that
this
was
the
kind
of
talk
that
would
appeal
to
her
the
magistrate
began
to
spread
himself
and
delivered
harangue
on
the
curse
of
liquor
and
drunkenness
karin
recognized
all
her
own
thoughts
on
the
subject
and
was
glad
to
find
that
they
were
shared
by
so
intelligent
a
man
as
the
magistrate
in
the
middle
of
his
monologue
berger
sven
persson
glanced
over
at
halvor
who
sat
at
the
table
looking
glum
and
sulky
his
coffee
cup
untouched
it
pretty
rough
on
him
thought
berger
sven
persson
particularly
if
there
any
truth
in
what
people
say
about
his
having
given
elof
a
little
lift
on
his
way
into
the
next
world
anyway
he
did
karin
a
good
service
by
relieving
her
of
that
dreadful
sot
and
since
the
magistrate
seemed
to
think
that
he
had
as
good
as
won
the
game
he
felt
rather
friendly
toward
halvor
raising
his
cup
he
said
here
to
you
halvor
you
certainly
did
karin
a
good
turn
when
you
took
her
drunken
sot
of
a
husband
off
her
hands
halvor
did
not
respond
to
the
toast
he
sat
looking
the
man
straight
in
the
eyes
and
wondered
how
he
should
take
this
the
inspector
again
burst
out
laughing
yes
yes
a
good
turn
he
a
real
good
turn
yes
yes
a
real
good
turn
echoed
the
innkeeper
son
with
a
chuckle
before
they
were
done
laughing
karin
had
vanished
like
a
shadow
through
the
kitchen
door
but
she
could
hear
from
the
kitchen
all
that
was
said
inside
she
was
both
sorry
and
distressed
over
halvor
untimely
visit
it
would
probably
result
in
her
never
being
able
to
marry
halvor
it
was
plain
that
the
gossips
were
already
spreading
evil
reports
i
ca
bear
the
thought
of
losing
him
she
sighed
for
a
time
no
sound
came
from
the
but
presently
she
heard
a
noise
as
if
a
chair
were
being
pushed
back
some
one
had
evidently
risen
are
you
going
already
halvor
young
ingmar
was
heard
to
say
yes
halvor
replied
i
ca
stop
any
longer
please
say
to
karin
for
me
why
do
you
go
into
the
kitchen
and
say
it
for
yourself
no
halvor
was
heard
to
answer
we
two
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
each
other
karin
heart
began
to
pump
hard
and
thoughts
came
rushing
into
her
head
as
if
on
wings
now
halvor
was
angry
at
her
and
no
wonder
she
had
hardly
dared
even
to
shake
hands
with
him
and
when
the
others
had
scoffed
at
him
she
never
opened
her
mouth
in
his
defence
but
quietly
sneaked
away
now
he
must
think
she
did
not
care
for
him
and
was
therefore
going
never
to
return
she
could
not
understand
why
she
should
have
treated
him
so
shabbily
she
who
was
so
fond
of
him
then
all
at
once
her
father
old
saying
came
to
her
the
ingmarssons
need
have
no
fear
of
men
they
have
only
to
walk
in
the
ways
of
god
karin
hastily
opened
the
door
and
stood
facing
halvor
before
he
could
manage
to
leave
the
room
are
you
leaving
so
soon
halvor
she
asked
i
thought
you
were
going
to
stay
to
supper
halvor
stood
staring
at
karin
she
seemed
to
be
completely
changed
her
cheeks
were
aglow
and
there
was
something
tender
and
appealing
about
her
which
he
had
never
seen
before
i
going
and
i
not
coming
back
said
halvor
he
had
not
caught
her
meaning
apparently
do
stay
and
finish
your
coffee
she
urged
then
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
back
to
the
table
she
turned
both
white
and
red
and
several
times
she
all
but
lost
her
courage
just
the
same
she
braved
it
out
although
there
was
nothing
she
feared
so
much
as
scorn
and
contempt
now
he
will
at
least
see
that
i
willing
to
stand
by
him
she
thought
turning
toward
her
guests
she
said
berger
sven
persson
and
all
of
you
halvor
and
i
have
not
spoken
of
this
matter
as
i
have
so
recently
become
a
widow
but
now
it
seems
best
that
you
should
all
know
that
i
would
rather
marry
halvor
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
she
paused
to
get
control
of
her
voice
then
concluded
folks
may
say
what
they
like
about
this
but
halvor
and
i
have
done
nothing
wrong
when
karin
had
finished
speaking
she
drew
nearer
to
halvor
as
if
seeking
protection
against
all
the
cruel
slander
that
would
come
now
the
men
were
speechless
mostly
from
astonishment
at
karin
ingmarsson
who
looked
younger
and
more
girlish
than
ever
before
in
her
life
then
halvor
said
in
a
voice
vibrant
with
feeling
karin
when
i
received
your
father
watch
i
felt
that
nothing
greater
could
have
happened
to
me
but
this
thing
which
you
have
just
done
transcends
everything
whereupon
berger
sven
persson
who
was
in
many
ways
an
excellent
man
arose
let
us
all
congratulate
karin
and
halvor
he
said
graciously
for
every
one
must
know
that
he
whom
karin
daughter
of
ingmar
has
chosen
is
a
man
of
sterling
worth
in
zion
that
an
old
country
schoolmaster
should
sometimes
be
a
little
too
is
not
surprising
for
well
nigh
a
lifetime
he
has
imparted
knowledge
and
given
advice
to
his
fellowmen
he
sees
that
all
the
peasants
are
living
by
what
he
has
taught
and
that
not
one
among
them
knows
more
than
what
he
their
schoolmaster
has
told
them
how
can
he
help
but
regard
all
the
people
in
the
parish
as
mere
school
children
however
old
they
may
have
grown
it
is
only
natural
that
he
should
consider
himself
wiser
than
every
one
else
it
seems
almost
an
impossibility
for
one
of
these
regular
old
school
persons
to
treat
any
one
as
a
for
he
looks
upon
each
and
every
one
as
a
child
with
dimpled
cheeks
and
wide
innocent
baby
eyes
one
sunday
in
the
winter
just
after
service
the
pastor
and
the
schoolmaster
stood
talking
together
in
the
vestry
the
conversation
had
turned
upon
the
salvation
army
it
a
singular
idea
to
have
hit
upon
the
pastor
remarked
i
never
imagined
that
i
should
live
to
see
anything
of
that
sort
the
schoolmaster
glanced
sharply
at
the
pastor
he
thought
his
remark
entirely
irrelevant
surely
the
pastor
could
never
think
that
such
an
absurd
innovation
would
find
its
way
into
their
parish
i
do
believe
you
are
likely
to
see
it
either
he
said
emphatically
the
pastor
knowing
that
he
himself
was
a
weak
and
man
let
the
schoolmaster
have
things
pretty
much
his
own
way
but
all
the
same
he
could
not
refrain
from
chaffing
him
a
little
occasionally
how
can
you
feel
so
cocksure
that
we
shall
escape
the
salvation
army
storm
he
said
you
see
when
pastor
and
schoolmaster
stand
together
there
no
fear
of
any
nuisance
of
that
sort
crowding
in
yet
i
not
altogether
certain
storm
that
you
do
stand
by
me
you
preach
to
suit
yourself
in
your
zion
to
this
the
schoolmaster
did
not
reply
at
once
presently
he
said
quite
meekly
the
pastor
has
never
heard
me
preach
the
mission
house
was
a
veritable
rock
of
offence
the
clergyman
had
never
set
foot
in
the
place
and
now
that
this
mooted
question
had
come
up
both
men
were
sorry
they
had
said
anything
to
hurt
each
other
feelings
perhaps
i
unjust
to
storm
thought
the
pastor
during
the
four
years
that
he
has
been
holding
his
afternoon
bible
talks
on
sundays
there
has
been
a
larger
attendance
at
the
morning
church
services
than
ever
before
and
i
have
seen
the
least
sign
of
division
in
the
church
storm
has
not
destroyed
the
parish
as
i
feared
he
would
he
is
a
faithful
friend
and
servant
and
i
mean
to
show
him
how
much
i
appreciate
him
the
little
misunderstanding
of
the
forenoon
resulted
in
the
pastor
attending
the
schoolmaster
meeting
in
the
afternoon
i
give
storm
a
pleasant
surprise
he
thought
i
will
go
to
hear
him
preach
in
his
zion
on
the
way
to
the
mission
house
the
pastor
thoughts
went
back
to
the
time
it
was
built
how
full
the
air
had
been
of
prophecies
and
how
firmly
he
had
believed
that
god
had
intended
it
to
be
something
great
but
nothing
much
had
happened
our
lord
must
have
changed
his
mind
he
thought
amused
at
his
entertaining
such
queer
ideas
regarding
our
lord
the
schoolmaster
zion
was
a
large
hall
with
walls
on
either
side
hung
wood
engravings
of
luther
and
melanchton
in
cloaks
along
the
borders
close
to
the
ceiling
ran
highly
illuminated
bible
texts
embellished
with
flowers
and
heavenly
trumpets
and
bassoons
at
the
front
of
the
room
above
the
speaker
platform
hung
an
oleograph
representing
the
good
shepherd
the
large
bare
room
was
full
of
people
which
was
all
that
seemed
necessary
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
impressive
solemnity
most
of
the
people
were
dressed
in
the
picturesque
peasant
costume
of
the
parish
and
the
starched
and
flaring
white
headgear
of
the
women
made
the
room
look
as
if
it
were
filled
with
large
birds
storm
had
already
commenced
his
address
when
he
saw
the
pastor
come
down
the
aisle
and
take
a
seat
in
the
front
row
you
a
wonderful
man
storm
thought
the
everything
comes
your
way
here
the
pastor
himself
to
do
you
honour
during
the
time
that
the
schoolmaster
had
been
holding
meetings
he
had
explained
the
bible
from
cover
to
cover
that
afternoon
he
spoke
of
the
heavenly
jerusalem
and
everlasting
bliss
as
given
in
the
book
of
the
revelation
he
was
so
pleased
at
the
parson
having
come
that
he
kept
thinking
to
himself
for
my
part
i
ask
for
anything
better
than
to
stand
on
a
platform
through
all
eternity
teaching
good
and
obedient
children
and
if
on
occasion
our
lord
himself
should
drop
in
to
hear
me
as
the
pastor
has
done
no
one
in
heaven
would
be
more
delighted
than
i
the
pastor
became
interested
when
the
schoolmaster
began
to
talk
about
jerusalem
and
the
strange
misgivings
which
he
had
had
long
ago
flashed
through
his
mind
again
in
the
middle
of
the
service
the
door
opened
and
a
number
of
people
came
in
there
were
about
twenty
and
they
stopped
at
the
door
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
meeting
ah
thought
the
parson
i
knew
something
was
going
to
happen
storm
had
no
sooner
said
amen
than
a
voice
coming
from
some
one
in
the
group
down
by
the
door
piped
up
i
should
very
much
like
to
say
a
few
words
that
must
be
hök
matts
ericsson
thought
the
pastor
and
others
with
him
for
no
one
else
in
the
parish
had
such
a
sweet
and
childlike
treble
the
next
moment
a
little
man
made
his
way
up
to
the
platform
followed
by
a
score
of
men
and
women
who
seemed
to
be
there
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
and
encouraging
him
the
pastor
the
schoolmaster
and
the
entire
congregation
sat
in
suspense
hök
matts
has
come
to
tell
us
of
some
awful
calamity
they
thought
either
the
king
is
dead
or
war
has
been
declared
or
perhaps
some
poor
creature
has
fallen
into
the
river
and
been
drowned
still
hök
matts
did
not
look
as
if
he
had
any
bad
news
to
impart
he
seemed
to
be
in
earnest
and
somewhat
stirred
but
at
the
same
time
he
looked
so
pleased
that
he
could
hardly
keep
from
smiling
i
want
to
say
to
the
schoolmaster
and
to
the
congregation
he
began
that
sunday
before
last
while
i
was
sitting
at
home
with
my
family
the
spirit
descended
upon
me
and
i
began
to
preach
we
could
get
down
here
to
listen
to
storm
on
account
of
the
ice
and
sleet
and
we
sat
longing
to
hear
the
word
of
god
then
all
at
once
i
had
the
feeling
that
i
could
speak
myself
i
been
preaching
now
for
two
sundays
and
all
my
folks
at
home
and
our
neighbours
too
have
told
me
that
i
ought
to
come
down
here
and
let
all
the
people
hear
me
hök
matts
also
said
he
was
astonished
that
the
gift
of
speech
should
have
fallen
upon
so
humble
a
man
but
the
schoolmaster
himself
is
only
a
peasant
he
added
with
a
little
more
confidence
after
this
preamble
hök
matts
folded
his
hands
and
was
ready
to
begin
preaching
at
once
but
by
that
time
the
schoolmaster
had
recovered
from
his
first
shock
of
surprise
do
you
think
of
speaking
here
now
hök
matts
immediately
yes
that
my
intention
the
man
replied
he
grew
as
frightened
as
a
child
when
storm
glowered
at
him
it
was
my
purpose
of
course
to
first
ask
leave
of
the
schoolmaster
and
the
rest
he
stammered
we
all
through
for
the
day
said
storm
conclusively
then
the
meek
little
man
began
to
beg
with
tears
in
his
voice
wo
you
please
let
me
say
a
few
words
i
only
want
to
tell
of
the
things
that
have
come
to
me
when
walking
behind
the
plow
and
when
working
by
myself
at
the
kiln
and
now
they
want
to
come
out
but
the
schoolmaster
though
he
had
had
such
a
day
of
triumph
himself
felt
no
pity
for
the
poor
little
man
matts
ericsson
comes
here
with
his
own
peculiar
notions
and
claims
that
they
are
messages
from
god
he
declared
rebukingly
hök
matts
dared
not
venture
a
protest
and
the
schoolmaster
opened
the
hymnbook
let
us
all
join
in
singing
hymn
one
hundred
and
he
said
whereupon
he
read
out
the
hymn
in
stentorian
tones
then
he
began
to
sing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
are
your
windows
open
toward
jerusalem
meanwhile
he
thought
it
was
well
after
all
that
the
pastor
happened
in
now
he
can
see
that
i
know
how
to
maintain
order
in
my
zion
but
no
sooner
was
the
hymn
finished
than
a
man
jumped
to
his
feet
it
was
proud
and
dignified
ljung
björn
olafsson
who
was
married
to
one
of
the
ingmar
girls
and
was
the
owner
of
a
large
farmstead
in
the
heart
of
the
parish
we
down
at
this
end
think
that
the
schoolmaster
might
have
consulted
our
wishes
before
turning
matts
ericsson
down
he
mildly
protested
oh
you
think
so
do
you
sonny
the
schoolmaster
spoke
in
just
the
kind
of
tone
he
would
have
used
in
reproving
some
young
whippersnapper
then
let
me
tell
you
that
no
one
but
myself
has
any
say
here
in
this
hall
ljung
björn
turned
blood
red
he
had
not
meant
to
provoke
a
quarrel
with
storm
but
had
simply
wished
to
soften
the
blow
for
hök
matts
who
was
an
inoffensive
man
just
the
same
he
could
not
help
feeling
chagrined
over
the
reply
he
had
got
but
before
he
could
think
of
a
retort
one
of
the
men
who
had
come
in
with
hök
matts
spoke
up
twice
i
have
heard
hök
matts
preach
and
must
say
that
he
is
wonderful
i
believe
that
every
one
present
would
be
helped
by
hearing
him
the
schoolmaster
answered
pleasantly
enough
but
in
the
old
admonishing
tone
of
the
classroom
surely
you
understand
krister
larsson
that
i
ca
allow
this
were
i
to
let
hök
matts
preach
then
you
krister
would
want
to
preach
next
sunday
and
ljung
björn
the
sunday
after
at
this
several
persons
laughed
but
ljung
björn
was
ready
with
a
sharp
rejoinder
i
see
no
reason
why
krister
and
i
should
be
as
well
qualified
to
preach
as
the
schoolmaster
he
said
thereupon
tims
halvor
arose
and
tried
to
quiet
them
and
to
prevent
possible
strife
those
of
us
who
have
furnished
the
money
to
build
and
run
this
mission
should
be
consulted
before
any
new
preacher
is
allowed
to
speak
by
that
time
krister
larsson
had
become
aroused
and
was
on
his
feet
again
i
recall
to
mind
that
when
we
built
this
hall
we
were
all
agreed
that
it
should
be
a
meetinghouse
and
not
a
church
where
only
one
man
is
allowed
to
preach
the
word
when
krister
had
spoken
every
one
seemed
to
breathe
freer
only
one
short
hour
before
it
had
not
occurred
to
them
that
they
could
ever
wish
to
hear
any
speaker
but
the
schoolmaster
now
they
thought
it
would
be
a
treat
to
hear
something
different
we
like
to
hear
something
new
and
to
see
a
fresh
face
behind
the
rostrum
somebody
muttered
in
all
likelihood
there
would
have
been
no
further
disturbance
if
only
bullet
gunner
had
remained
away
that
day
he
too
was
a
of
tims
halvor
and
a
tall
fellow
with
a
swarthy
skin
and
piercing
eyes
gunner
as
well
as
every
one
else
liked
the
schoolmaster
but
what
he
liked
even
more
was
a
good
scrap
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
about
freedom
while
we
were
building
this
house
said
gunner
but
i
have
heard
a
liberal
word
since
the
place
was
first
opened
the
schoolmaster
grew
purple
gunner
remark
was
the
first
evidence
of
any
actual
hostility
or
revolt
let
me
remind
you
bullet
gunner
that
here
you
have
heard
the
true
freedom
preached
as
luther
taught
it
but
here
there
has
been
no
license
to
preach
the
kind
of
ideas
that
spring
up
one
day
and
fall
to
the
ground
the
next
the
schoolmaster
would
have
us
think
that
everything
new
is
worthless
as
soon
as
it
touches
upon
doctrine
gunner
replied
soothingly
and
half
regretfully
he
approves
of
our
using
new
methods
of
caring
for
our
cattle
and
wants
us
to
adopt
the
latest
agricultural
machinery
but
we
are
not
allowed
to
know
anything
about
the
new
implements
with
which
god
acres
are
now
being
tilled
storm
began
to
think
that
bullet
gunner
bark
was
worse
than
his
bite
is
it
your
meaning
he
said
adopting
a
facetious
tone
that
we
should
preach
a
different
doctrine
here
from
the
lutheran
it
is
not
a
question
of
a
new
doctrine
roared
gunner
but
as
to
who
shall
preach
and
as
far
as
i
know
matts
ericsson
is
as
good
a
lutheran
as
either
the
schoolmaster
or
the
parson
for
the
moment
the
schoolmaster
had
forgotten
about
the
parson
but
now
he
glanced
down
at
him
the
clergyman
sat
quietly
musing
his
chin
resting
upon
the
knob
of
his
cane
there
was
a
curious
gleam
in
his
eyes
which
were
fixed
upon
storm
never
leaving
him
for
a
second
after
all
perhaps
it
would
have
been
just
as
well
if
the
parson
had
come
thought
the
schoolmaster
what
was
then
taking
place
reminded
storm
of
something
he
had
experienced
before
it
could
be
just
like
this
in
school
sometimes
on
a
bright
spring
morning
when
a
little
bird
perched
itself
outside
the
schoolroom
window
and
warbled
lustily
then
all
at
once
the
children
would
tease
and
beg
to
be
excused
from
school
they
abandoned
their
studies
and
made
so
much
fuss
and
noise
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
bring
them
to
order
something
of
the
same
sort
had
come
over
the
congregation
after
hök
matts
arrival
however
the
schoolmaster
meant
to
show
the
pastor
and
all
of
them
that
he
was
man
enough
to
quell
the
mutiny
first
i
will
leave
them
alone
and
let
the
ringleaders
talk
themselves
hoarse
he
thought
and
went
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
behind
the
table
on
which
the
water
bottle
stood
instantly
there
arose
against
him
a
perfect
storm
of
protests
for
by
that
time
every
one
had
become
inflated
with
the
idea
that
they
were
all
of
them
just
as
good
as
the
schoolmaster
why
should
he
alone
be
allowed
to
tell
us
what
to
believe
and
what
not
to
believe
they
shouted
these
ideas
seemed
to
be
new
to
most
of
them
yet
from
the
talk
it
became
evident
that
they
had
been
germinating
in
their
minds
ever
since
the
schoolmaster
had
built
the
mission
house
and
shown
them
that
a
plain
ordinary
man
can
preach
the
word
of
god
after
a
bit
storm
remarked
to
himself
the
tempest
of
the
children
must
have
spent
itself
by
this
now
is
the
time
to
show
them
who
is
master
here
whereupon
he
rose
up
pounded
the
table
with
his
fist
and
thundered
stop
what
the
meaning
of
all
this
racketing
i
going
now
and
you
must
go
too
so
that
i
may
put
out
the
lights
and
lock
up
some
of
them
actually
did
get
up
for
they
had
all
gone
to
school
and
knew
that
when
their
teacher
rapped
on
the
table
it
meant
that
everybody
had
to
mind
yet
the
majority
stoically
kept
their
seats
the
schoolmaster
forgets
that
now
we
are
grown
men
said
one
but
he
still
seems
to
think
we
should
run
just
because
he
happens
to
rap
on
the
table
said
another
they
went
right
on
talking
about
their
wanting
to
hear
some
new
speakers
and
which
ones
they
should
call
in
they
were
already
quarrelling
among
themselves
as
to
whether
it
should
be
the
waldenstromites
or
colporteurs
from
the
national
evangelical
union
the
schoolmaster
stood
staring
at
the
assemblage
as
if
he
were
looking
at
some
weird
monstrosity
for
up
to
that
time
he
had
seen
only
the
child
in
each
individual
face
but
now
all
the
round
baby
cheeks
the
soft
baby
curls
and
the
mild
baby
eyes
had
vanished
and
he
saw
only
a
gathering
of
adults
with
hard
set
faces
he
felt
that
over
such
as
these
he
had
no
control
he
did
not
even
know
what
to
say
to
them
the
tumult
continued
growing
louder
and
louder
the
schoolmaster
kept
still
and
let
them
rage
bullet
gunner
ljung
björn
and
krister
larsson
led
the
attack
hök
matts
who
was
the
innocent
cause
of
all
the
trouble
rose
to
his
feet
time
and
again
and
begged
them
to
be
quiet
but
no
one
listened
to
him
once
again
the
schoolmaster
glanced
down
at
the
parson
who
was
still
quietly
musing
the
same
gleam
in
his
eyes
which
were
fixed
on
the
schoolmaster
he
probably
thinking
of
that
evening
four
years
ago
when
i
told
him
i
would
build
a
mission
thought
storm
he
was
right
too
everything
has
turned
out
just
as
he
said
it
would
heresy
revolt
and
division
perhaps
we
might
have
escaped
all
this
if
i
been
so
bent
upon
building
my
zion
the
instant
this
became
clear
to
the
schoolmaster
his
head
went
up
and
his
backbone
straightened
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
key
of
polished
steel
it
was
the
key
to
zion
he
held
it
toward
the
light
so
that
it
could
be
seen
from
all
parts
of
the
hall
now
i
going
to
lay
this
key
upon
the
table
he
said
and
i
shall
never
touch
it
again
for
i
see
now
that
it
has
unlocked
the
door
to
everything
which
i
had
hoped
to
shut
out
whereupon
the
schoolmaster
put
the
key
down
took
up
his
hat
and
walked
straight
over
to
the
pastor
i
want
to
thank
you
parson
for
coming
to
hear
me
he
said
for
if
you
had
come
you
never
could
have
heard
me
the
wild
hunt
there
were
many
who
thought
that
elof
ersson
should
have
found
no
peace
in
his
grave
for
the
shameful
way
in
which
he
had
dealt
with
karin
and
young
ingmar
he
had
deliberately
made
way
with
all
of
his
and
karin
money
so
she
would
suffer
hardship
after
his
death
and
he
left
the
farm
so
heavily
mortgaged
that
karin
would
have
been
forced
to
turn
it
over
to
the
creditors
had
not
halvor
been
rich
enough
to
buy
in
the
property
and
pay
off
the
debts
ingmar
ingmarsson
twenty
thousand
kroner
of
which
elof
had
been
sole
trustee
had
entirely
disappeared
some
people
thought
that
elof
had
buried
the
money
others
that
he
had
given
it
away
in
any
case
it
was
not
to
be
found
when
ingmar
learned
that
he
was
penniless
he
consulted
karin
as
to
what
he
should
do
ingmar
told
his
sister
that
of
all
things
he
would
prefer
to
be
a
teacher
and
begged
her
to
let
him
remain
with
the
storms
until
he
was
old
enough
to
enter
college
down
at
the
village
he
would
always
be
able
to
borrow
books
from
the
schoolmaster
or
the
pastor
he
said
and
moreover
he
could
help
storm
at
the
school
by
reading
with
the
children
that
would
be
excellent
practice
karin
turned
this
over
in
her
mind
before
answering
i
suppose
you
would
care
to
remain
at
home
since
you
ca
become
master
here
she
said
when
storm
daughter
heard
that
ingmar
was
coming
back
she
pulled
a
long
face
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
they
must
have
a
boy
living
with
them
they
might
better
have
the
judge
son
bertil
or
there
was
jolly
gabriel
the
son
of
hök
matts
ericsson
gertrude
liked
both
gabriel
and
bertil
but
as
for
ingmar
she
could
exactly
tell
what
her
feelings
were
toward
him
she
liked
him
because
he
helped
her
with
her
lessons
and
minded
her
like
a
slave
but
she
could
also
become
thoroughly
put
out
with
him
sometimes
because
he
was
clumsy
and
tiresome
and
did
not
know
how
to
play
she
had
to
admire
his
diligence
and
his
aptitude
for
learning
yet
at
times
she
fairly
despised
him
for
not
being
able
to
show
off
what
he
could
do
gertrude
head
was
always
full
of
droll
fancies
and
dreams
which
she
confided
to
ingmar
if
the
lad
happened
to
be
away
for
a
few
days
she
grew
restless
and
felt
that
she
had
no
one
to
talk
to
but
as
soon
as
he
got
back
she
hardly
knew
what
she
had
been
longing
for
the
girl
had
never
thought
of
ingmar
as
a
boy
of
means
and
good
family
connections
but
treated
him
rather
as
though
he
were
a
little
beneath
her
yet
when
she
heard
that
ingmar
had
become
poor
she
wept
for
him
and
when
he
told
her
that
he
would
not
try
to
get
back
his
property
but
meant
to
earn
his
own
living
as
a
teacher
she
was
so
indignant
she
could
hardly
control
herself
the
lord
only
knows
all
she
had
dreamed
that
he
would
be
some
day
the
children
at
storm
school
were
given
very
rigid
training
they
were
held
strictly
to
their
tasks
and
only
on
rare
occasions
were
they
allowed
any
amusements
however
all
this
was
changed
the
spring
storm
gave
up
his
preaching
then
mother
stina
said
to
him
now
storm
we
must
let
the
young
folks
be
young
remember
that
you
and
i
were
young
once
why
when
we
were
seventeen
we
danced
many
a
night
from
sundown
to
sunup
so
one
saturday
night
when
young
gabriel
and
gunhild
the
councilman
daughter
paid
a
visit
to
the
storms
they
actually
had
a
dance
at
the
schoolhouse
gertrude
was
wild
with
delight
at
being
allowed
to
dance
but
ingmar
would
not
join
in
instead
he
took
up
a
book
and
went
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
by
the
window
time
and
again
gertrude
tried
to
make
him
lay
down
his
book
but
ingmar
sulky
and
shy
refused
to
budge
mother
stina
looked
at
him
and
shook
her
head
it
plain
he
comes
of
an
old
old
stock
she
thought
that
kind
can
never
be
really
young
the
three
who
did
dance
had
such
a
good
time
they
talked
of
going
to
a
regular
dance
the
next
saturday
evening
and
asked
the
schoolmaster
and
mother
stina
what
they
thought
about
it
if
you
will
do
your
dancing
at
strong
ingmar
i
give
my
consent
said
mother
stina
for
there
you
will
meet
only
respectable
folk
then
storm
also
made
it
conditional
i
ca
allow
gertrude
to
go
to
a
dance
unless
ingmar
goes
along
to
look
after
her
he
said
whereupon
all
three
rushed
up
to
ingmar
and
begged
him
to
accompany
them
no
he
growled
without
even
glancing
up
from
his
book
it
no
good
asking
him
said
gertrude
in
a
tone
that
made
ingmar
raise
his
eyes
gertrude
looked
radiantly
beautiful
after
the
dance
she
smiled
scornfully
and
her
eyes
flashed
as
she
turned
away
it
was
plainly
to
be
seen
how
much
she
despised
him
for
sitting
there
so
ugly
and
sulky
like
some
crotchety
old
man
ingmar
had
to
alter
his
mind
and
say
yes
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
a
few
evenings
later
while
gertrude
and
mother
stina
sat
spinning
in
the
kitchen
the
girl
suddenly
noticed
that
her
mother
was
getting
uneasy
every
little
while
she
would
stop
her
and
listen
i
ca
imagine
what
that
noise
is
she
said
do
you
hear
anything
gertrude
yes
i
do
replied
the
girl
there
must
be
some
one
upstairs
in
the
classroom
who
could
be
there
at
this
hour
mother
stina
flouted
only
listen
to
the
rustling
and
the
pattering
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
and
there
certainly
was
a
rustling
and
a
pattering
and
a
bumping
about
over
their
heads
that
made
both
gertrude
and
her
mother
feel
creepy
there
must
surely
be
some
one
up
there
insisted
gertrude
there
ca
be
mother
stina
declared
let
me
tell
you
that
this
thing
has
been
going
on
every
night
since
you
danced
here
gertrude
perceived
that
her
mother
imagined
the
house
had
been
haunted
since
the
night
of
the
dance
if
that
idea
were
allowed
to
become
fixed
in
mother
stina
mind
there
would
be
no
more
dancing
for
gertrude
i
going
up
there
to
see
what
it
is
said
the
girl
rising
but
her
mother
caught
hold
of
her
skirt
i
do
know
whether
i
dare
let
you
go
she
said
nonsense
mother
it
best
to
find
out
what
this
is
then
i
better
go
with
you
the
mother
decided
they
crept
softly
up
the
stairs
when
they
got
to
the
door
they
were
afraid
to
open
it
mother
stina
bent
down
and
peeped
through
the
keyhole
presently
she
gave
a
little
chuckle
what
pleases
you
mother
asked
gertrude
see
for
yourself
only
be
very
quiet
then
gertrude
put
her
eye
to
the
keyhole
inside
benches
and
desks
had
been
pushed
against
the
wall
and
in
the
centre
of
the
schoolroom
amid
a
cloud
of
dust
ingmar
ingmarsson
was
whirling
round
with
a
chair
in
his
arms
has
ingmar
gone
mad
exclaimed
gertrude
ssh
warned
the
mother
drawing
her
away
from
the
door
and
down
the
stairs
he
must
be
trying
to
teach
himself
to
dance
i
suppose
he
wants
to
learn
how
so
he
be
able
to
dance
at
the
party
she
added
with
smirk
then
mother
stina
began
to
shake
with
laughter
he
came
near
frightening
the
life
out
of
me
she
confessed
thank
god
he
can
be
young
for
once
when
she
had
got
over
her
fit
of
laughing
she
said
you
not
to
say
a
word
about
this
to
anybody
do
you
hear
saturday
evening
the
four
young
people
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
schoolhouse
ready
to
start
mother
stina
looked
them
over
approvingly
the
boys
had
on
yellow
buckskin
breeches
and
green
homespun
waistcoats
with
bright
red
sleeves
gunhild
and
gertrude
wore
stripe
skirts
bordered
with
red
cloth
and
white
blouses
with
big
puffed
sleeves
flowered
kerchiefs
were
crossed
over
their
bodices
and
they
had
on
aprons
that
were
as
flowered
as
their
kerchiefs
as
the
four
of
them
walked
along
in
the
twilight
of
a
perfect
spring
evening
nothing
was
said
for
quite
a
long
time
now
and
then
gertrude
would
cast
a
side
glance
at
ingmar
thinking
of
how
he
had
worked
to
learn
to
dance
whatever
the
reason
whether
it
was
the
memory
of
ingmar
weird
dancing
or
the
anticipation
of
attending
a
regular
dance
her
thoughts
became
light
and
airy
she
managed
to
keep
just
a
little
behind
the
others
that
she
might
muse
undisturbed
she
had
made
up
quite
little
story
about
how
the
trees
had
come
by
their
new
leaves
it
happened
in
this
way
she
thought
the
trees
after
sleeping
peacefully
and
quietly
the
whole
winter
suddenly
began
to
dream
they
dreamt
that
summer
had
come
they
seemed
to
see
the
fields
dressed
in
green
grass
and
waving
corn
the
hawthorn
shimmered
with
roses
brooks
and
ponds
were
spread
with
the
leaves
of
the
the
stones
were
hidden
under
the
creeping
tendrils
of
the
twin
flower
and
the
forest
carpet
was
thick
with
star
flowers
and
amid
all
this
that
was
clothed
and
decked
out
the
trees
saw
themselves
standing
gaunt
and
naked
they
began
to
feel
ashamed
of
their
nakedness
as
often
happens
in
dreams
in
their
confusion
and
embarrassment
the
trees
fancied
that
all
the
rest
were
making
fun
of
them
the
bumblebees
came
buzzingly
up
to
mock
at
them
the
magpies
laughed
them
to
scorn
while
the
other
birds
sang
taunting
ditties
where
shall
we
find
something
to
put
on
asked
the
trees
in
despair
but
they
had
not
a
leaf
to
their
names
on
either
twig
or
branch
and
their
distress
was
so
terrible
that
it
awakened
them
and
glancing
about
drowsy
like
their
first
thought
was
thank
god
it
was
only
a
dream
there
is
certainly
no
summer
hereabout
it
lucky
for
us
that
we
have
overslept
but
as
they
looked
around
more
carefully
they
noticed
that
the
streams
were
clear
of
ice
grass
blades
and
crocuses
beeped
out
from
their
beds
of
soil
and
under
their
own
ark
the
sap
was
running
spring
is
here
at
all
events
said
the
trees
so
it
was
well
we
awoke
we
have
slept
long
enough
for
this
year
now
it
high
time
we
were
getting
dressed
so
the
birches
hurriedly
put
on
some
sticky
pale
green
leaves
and
the
maples
a
few
green
flowers
the
leaves
of
the
alder
came
forth
in
such
a
crinkly
and
unfinished
state
that
they
looked
quite
malformed
but
the
slender
leave
of
the
willow
slipped
out
of
their
buds
smooth
and
shapely
from
the
start
gertrude
smiled
to
herself
as
she
walked
along
and
thought
this
up
she
only
wished
she
had
been
alone
with
ingmar
so
she
could
have
told
it
all
to
him
they
had
a
long
way
to
go
to
get
to
the
ingmar
farm
more
than
an
hour
tramp
they
followed
the
riverside
all
the
while
gertrude
kept
walking
a
little
behind
the
others
her
fancy
had
begun
to
play
around
the
red
glow
of
the
sunset
which
flamed
now
above
the
river
now
above
the
strand
gray
alder
and
green
birch
were
enveloped
by
the
shimmer
flashing
red
one
instant
the
next
taking
on
their
natural
hues
suddenly
ingmar
stopped
and
broke
off
in
the
middle
of
something
he
was
telling
what
the
matter
ingmar
asked
gunhild
ingmar
pale
as
a
ghost
stood
gazing
at
something
in
front
of
him
the
others
saw
only
a
wide
plain
covered
with
grain
fields
and
encircled
by
a
range
of
hills
and
in
the
centre
of
the
plain
a
big
farmstead
at
that
moment
the
glow
of
sunset
rested
upon
the
farm
all
the
window
pans
glittered
and
the
old
roofs
and
walls
had
a
bright
red
glimmer
about
them
gertrude
promptly
stepped
up
to
the
others
and
after
a
quick
glance
at
ingmar
she
drew
gunhild
and
gabriel
aside
we
must
question
him
about
anything
around
here
she
said
under
her
breath
that
place
over
yonder
is
the
ingmar
farm
the
sight
of
it
has
probably
made
him
sad
he
has
been
at
home
in
two
years
not
since
he
lost
all
his
money
the
road
which
they
had
taken
was
the
one
leading
past
the
farm
and
down
to
strong
ingmar
cabin
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
soon
ingmar
came
running
after
calling
had
we
better
go
this
way
instead
then
he
led
them
in
on
a
bypath
that
wound
around
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
by
which
they
could
reach
the
cabin
without
having
to
cross
the
farm
proper
you
know
strong
ingmar
i
suppose
said
gabriel
oh
yes
young
ingmar
replied
we
used
to
be
good
friends
in
the
old
days
is
it
true
that
he
understands
magic
asked
gunhild
well
no
ingmar
answered
rather
hesitatingly
as
if
it
himself
you
may
as
well
tell
us
what
you
know
persisted
gunhild
the
schoolmaster
says
we
must
believe
in
such
things
the
schoolmaster
ca
prevent
a
person
seeing
what
he
sees
and
believing
what
he
knows
gabriel
declared
ingmar
wanted
to
tell
them
all
about
his
home
memories
of
his
childhood
came
back
to
him
at
sight
of
the
old
place
i
can
tell
you
about
something
that
i
saw
once
he
said
it
happened
one
winter
when
father
and
strong
ingmar
were
up
in
the
forest
working
at
the
kiln
when
christmas
came
around
strong
ingmar
offered
to
tend
the
kiln
by
himself
so
that
father
could
come
home
for
the
holidays
the
day
before
christmas
mother
sent
me
up
to
the
forest
with
a
basket
of
good
fare
for
strong
ingmar
i
started
early
so
as
to
be
there
before
the
midday
dinner
hour
when
i
came
up
father
and
strong
ingmar
had
just
finished
drawing
a
kiln
and
all
the
charcoal
had
been
spread
on
the
ground
to
cool
it
was
still
smoking
and
where
the
coals
lay
thickest
it
was
ready
to
take
fire
which
is
something
that
must
not
happen
to
prevent
that
is
the
most
important
part
of
the
entire
process
of
charcoal
making
therefore
father
said
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
afraid
have
to
go
home
alone
little
ingmar
i
ca
leave
strong
ingmar
with
all
this
work
strong
ingmar
walked
along
the
side
of
the
heap
where
the
smoke
rose
thickest
can
go
big
ingmar
he
said
managed
worse
things
than
this
in
a
little
while
the
smoke
grew
less
let
see
what
kind
of
a
christmas
treat
brita
has
sent
me
said
strong
ingmar
taking
the
basket
from
me
let
me
show
you
what
a
fine
house
we
got
here
then
he
took
me
into
the
hut
where
he
and
father
lived
at
the
back
was
a
rude
stone
and
the
other
walls
were
made
up
of
branches
of
spruce
and
blackthorn
my
lad
you
never
guessed
that
your
father
had
a
royal
castle
like
this
in
the
forest
eh
said
strong
ingmar
are
walls
that
keep
out
both
storm
and
frost
he
laughed
thrusting
his
arm
clean
through
the
spruce
branches
soon
father
came
in
laughing
he
and
the
old
man
were
black
with
soot
and
reeking
with
the
odour
of
sour
charcoal
smoke
but
never
had
i
seen
father
so
happy
and
full
of
fun
neither
of
them
could
stand
upright
in
the
hut
and
the
only
furniture
in
the
place
were
two
bunks
made
of
spruce
twigs
and
a
couple
of
flat
stones
on
which
they
had
built
a
fire
yet
they
were
perfectly
contented
they
sat
down
side
by
side
on
one
of
the
bunks
and
opened
the
basket
do
know
whether
you
can
have
any
of
this
said
strong
ingmar
to
father
it
my
christmas
dinner
you
know
christmas
eve
you
must
be
a
good
to
me
said
father
a
time
like
this
i
suppose
it
would
never
do
to
let
a
poor
old
charcoal
burner
starve
strong
ingmar
then
said
they
carried
on
like
that
all
the
time
they
were
eating
mother
had
sent
a
little
brandy
along
with
the
food
i
marvelled
that
people
could
be
so
happy
over
food
and
drink
have
to
tell
your
mother
that
big
ingmar
has
eaten
up
everything
said
the
old
man
that
she
will
have
to
send
more
i
see
said
i
just
then
i
was
startled
by
a
crackling
noise
in
the
fireplace
it
sounded
as
if
some
one
had
cast
a
handful
of
pebbles
on
the
stones
father
did
not
notice
it
but
at
once
strong
ingmar
said
so
soon
yet
he
went
on
eating
then
there
was
more
crackling
this
time
it
was
much
louder
now
it
sounded
as
if
a
shovelful
of
stones
had
been
thrown
on
the
fire
well
is
it
so
urgent
strong
ingmar
exclaimed
then
he
went
out
charcoal
must
be
afire
he
shouted
back
you
sit
still
big
ingmar
i
attend
to
this
myself
father
and
i
sat
very
quiet
in
a
little
while
strong
ingmar
returned
and
the
fun
began
anew
have
had
such
a
merry
christmas
in
years
he
laughed
he
had
no
sooner
got
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
than
the
crackling
started
afresh
again
well
i
never
and
out
he
flew
in
a
jiffy
the
charcoal
was
afire
again
when
the
old
man
came
back
for
the
second
time
father
said
to
him
see
now
that
you
have
such
good
help
up
here
that
you
can
get
along
by
yourself
you
can
safely
go
home
and
keep
your
christmas
big
ingmar
for
here
there
are
those
who
will
help
me
then
father
and
i
went
home
and
everything
was
all
right
and
never
either
before
or
afterward
was
any
kiln
tended
by
strong
ingmar
known
to
get
afire
gunhild
thanked
ingmar
for
his
story
but
gertrude
walked
on
in
silence
as
if
she
had
become
frightened
it
was
beginning
to
get
dark
everything
that
had
looked
so
rosy
a
while
ago
was
now
either
blue
or
gray
here
and
there
in
the
forest
could
be
seen
a
shiny
leaf
that
gleamed
in
the
twilight
like
the
red
eye
of
a
troll
gertrude
was
astonished
at
ingmar
having
talked
so
much
and
so
long
he
seemed
like
another
person
since
coming
in
on
home
ground
he
carried
his
head
higher
than
usual
and
stepped
with
firmer
tread
gertrude
did
not
quite
like
this
change
in
him
it
made
her
feel
uneasy
all
the
same
she
spunked
up
and
began
to
tease
ingmar
about
his
going
home
to
dance
then
at
last
they
came
to
a
little
gray
hut
candles
were
burning
inside
the
windows
being
too
small
to
let
in
much
light
they
caught
the
sound
of
violin
music
and
the
clatter
of
dancing
feet
still
the
girls
paused
wonderingly
is
it
here
they
questioned
can
any
one
dance
here
the
place
looks
too
small
to
hold
even
one
couple
go
along
inside
said
gabriel
the
hut
is
as
tiny
as
looks
outside
the
door
which
was
open
stood
a
group
of
boys
and
girls
who
had
danced
themselves
into
a
warm
glow
the
girls
were
fanning
themselves
with
their
headshawls
and
the
boys
had
pulled
off
their
short
black
jackets
in
order
to
dance
in
their
bright
green
waistcoats
the
newcomers
edged
their
way
through
the
crowd
by
the
door
into
the
hut
the
first
person
they
saw
was
strong
ingmar
a
little
fat
man
with
a
big
head
and
a
long
beard
he
must
be
related
to
the
elves
and
the
trolls
thought
gertrude
the
old
man
was
standing
upon
the
hearth
playing
his
fiddle
so
as
not
to
be
in
the
way
of
the
dancers
the
hut
was
larger
than
it
had
appeared
from
the
outside
but
it
looked
poor
and
dilapidated
the
bare
pine
walls
were
and
the
beams
were
blackened
by
smoke
there
were
no
curtains
at
the
windows
and
no
cover
on
the
table
it
was
evident
that
strong
ingmar
lived
by
himself
his
children
had
all
left
him
and
gone
to
america
and
the
only
pleasure
the
old
man
had
in
his
loneliness
was
to
gather
the
young
folks
around
him
on
a
saturday
evening
and
let
them
dance
to
his
fiddle
it
was
dim
in
the
hut
and
suffocatingly
close
couple
after
couple
were
whirling
around
in
there
gertrude
could
scarcely
breathe
and
wanted
to
hurry
out
again
but
it
was
an
impossibility
to
get
past
the
tight
wedge
of
humanity
that
blocked
the
doorway
strong
ingmar
played
with
a
sure
stroke
and
in
perfect
time
but
the
instant
that
young
ingmarsson
came
into
the
room
he
drew
his
bow
across
the
strings
making
a
rasping
noise
that
brought
all
the
dancers
to
a
stop
it
nothing
he
shouted
go
on
with
the
dance
ingmar
placed
his
arm
around
gertrude
waist
to
dance
out
the
figure
gertrude
seemed
very
much
surprised
at
his
wanting
to
dance
but
they
could
get
nowhere
for
the
dancers
followed
each
other
so
closely
that
no
one
who
had
not
been
there
at
the
start
could
squeeze
in
between
them
the
old
man
stopped
short
rapped
on
the
fender
with
his
bow
and
said
in
a
commanding
voice
room
must
be
made
for
big
ingmar
son
when
there
any
dancing
in
my
shack
with
that
every
one
turned
to
have
a
look
at
ingmar
who
became
so
embarrassed
that
he
could
not
stir
gertrude
had
to
take
hold
of
him
and
fairly
drag
him
across
the
floor
as
soon
as
the
dance
was
finished
the
fiddler
came
down
to
greet
ingmar
when
he
felt
ingmar
hand
in
his
the
old
man
pretended
to
be
very
much
concerned
and
instantly
let
go
of
it
my
goodness
he
exclaimed
be
careful
of
those
delicate
schoolmaster
hands
a
clumsy
old
fellow
like
me
could
easily
crush
them
he
took
young
ingmar
and
his
friends
up
to
the
table
driving
away
several
old
women
who
were
sitting
there
looking
on
presently
he
went
over
to
the
cupboard
and
brought
out
some
bread
and
butter
and
root
beer
i
do
as
a
rule
offer
refreshments
at
these
affairs
he
said
the
others
have
to
be
content
with
just
music
and
dancing
but
ingmar
ingmarsson
must
have
a
bite
to
eat
under
my
roof
drawing
up
a
little
stool
the
old
man
sat
down
in
front
of
ingmar
and
looked
sharply
at
him
so
you
going
to
be
a
eh
he
queried
ingmar
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
there
was
the
shadow
of
a
smile
on
his
lips
but
all
the
same
he
answered
rather
mournfully
they
have
no
use
for
me
at
home
no
use
for
cried
the
old
man
you
do
know
how
soon
you
may
be
needed
on
the
farm
elof
lived
only
two
years
and
who
knows
how
long
halvor
will
hold
out
halvor
is
a
strong
hearty
fellow
ingmar
reminded
you
must
know
of
course
that
halvor
will
turn
the
farm
over
to
you
as
soon
as
you
able
to
buy
it
back
he
be
a
fool
to
give
up
the
ingmar
farm
now
that
it
has
fallen
into
his
hands
during
this
colloquy
ingmar
sat
gripping
the
edge
of
the
plain
deal
table
suddenly
a
noise
was
heard
as
of
something
cracking
ingmar
had
broken
off
a
corner
of
the
table
if
you
become
a
he
never
let
you
have
the
farm
the
old
man
went
on
you
think
not
think
think
well
it
plain
how
you
have
been
brought
up
have
you
ever
driven
a
plow
no
or
tended
a
kiln
or
felled
a
huge
pine
ingmar
sat
there
looking
quite
placid
but
the
table
kept
crumbling
under
his
fingers
finally
the
old
man
began
to
take
notice
see
here
young
man
he
said
when
he
saw
what
was
happening
i
shall
have
to
take
you
in
hand
once
more
then
he
picked
up
some
of
the
splinters
of
the
table
and
tried
to
fit
them
into
place
you
rogue
you
ought
to
be
going
around
to
fairs
showing
your
tricks
for
money
he
laughed
and
dealing
ingmar
a
hard
whack
on
the
shoulder
he
remarked
oh
you
make
a
fine
you
would
in
a
twinkling
he
was
back
at
the
fireplace
fiddling
away
now
there
was
a
snap
and
a
go
to
his
performance
he
beat
time
with
his
foot
and
set
the
dancers
whirling
this
is
young
ingmar
polka
he
called
out
now
the
whole
house
must
dance
for
young
ingmar
two
such
pretty
girls
as
gertrude
and
gunhild
had
to
be
in
every
dance
of
course
ingmar
did
not
do
much
dancing
he
stood
talking
most
of
the
time
with
some
of
the
older
men
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
between
dances
the
people
crowded
around
him
as
if
it
did
them
good
just
to
look
at
him
gertrude
thought
ingmar
had
entirely
forgotten
her
which
made
her
quite
miserable
now
he
feels
that
he
is
the
son
of
big
ingmar
and
that
i
am
only
the
gertrude
she
pouted
it
seemed
strange
to
her
that
she
should
take
this
so
to
heart
between
the
dances
some
of
the
young
folks
went
out
for
a
breath
of
air
the
night
had
grown
piercingly
cold
it
was
quite
dark
and
as
no
one
wanted
to
go
home
they
all
said
we
better
wait
a
little
while
the
moon
will
soon
be
out
now
it
too
dark
to
start
for
home
once
when
ingmar
and
gertrude
happened
to
be
standing
outside
the
door
the
old
man
came
and
drew
the
boy
away
come
let
me
show
you
something
he
said
and
taking
ingmar
by
the
hand
he
led
him
through
a
thicket
a
short
distance
away
from
the
house
stand
still
now
and
look
down
he
said
presently
then
ingmar
found
himself
looking
down
a
cleft
at
the
bottom
of
which
something
white
shimmered
this
must
be
langfors
rapids
said
young
ingmar
right
you
are
nodded
the
old
man
now
what
do
you
suppose
a
waterfall
like
that
can
be
used
for
eh
it
might
be
used
to
run
a
mill
said
ingmar
thoughtfully
the
old
man
laughed
to
himself
he
patted
ingmar
on
the
back
then
gave
him
a
dig
in
the
ribs
that
almost
sent
him
into
the
rapids
but
who
going
to
put
up
a
mill
here
who
going
to
get
rich
and
who
going
to
buy
the
ingmar
farm
eh
he
chuckled
i
just
like
to
know
said
ingmar
then
the
old
man
began
unfolding
a
big
plan
he
had
in
mind
ingmar
was
to
persuade
tims
halvor
to
put
up
a
sawmill
below
the
rapids
and
afterward
lease
it
to
him
for
many
years
the
old
man
dream
had
been
to
find
a
way
by
which
big
ingmar
son
might
come
into
his
own
again
ingmar
stood
quietly
looking
down
at
the
foaming
rapids
come
let
go
back
to
the
house
and
the
dancing
said
the
old
man
but
as
ingmar
did
not
stir
he
waited
patiently
if
he
the
right
sort
he
wo
reply
to
this
today
nor
yet
he
remarked
to
himself
an
ingmarsson
has
to
have
time
to
consider
and
as
they
stood
there
all
at
once
they
heard
a
sharp
and
angry
bark
that
seemed
to
come
from
some
dog
running
loose
in
the
forest
do
you
hear
that
ingmar
asked
the
old
man
yes
that
must
be
a
dog
on
the
rampage
then
they
heard
the
bark
more
distinctly
it
seemed
to
be
coming
nearer
as
if
the
beast
were
heading
straight
for
the
hut
the
old
man
seized
ingmar
by
the
wrist
come
boy
he
said
get
into
the
house
as
quick
as
you
can
what
the
matter
asked
ingmar
astonished
get
in
i
tell
you
as
they
made
for
the
hut
the
angry
barking
sounded
as
if
it
were
quite
close
to
them
what
kind
of
dog
is
it
ingmar
asked
again
and
again
get
inside
only
get
inside
cried
the
old
man
fairly
pushing
ingmar
into
the
narrow
passageway
before
closing
the
outer
door
he
shouted
if
there
are
any
of
you
outside
come
in
at
once
as
he
stood
holding
the
door
open
people
came
running
from
all
directions
in
with
you
in
with
you
he
shrieked
at
them
and
stamped
impatiently
meanwhile
the
people
in
the
hut
were
becoming
alarmed
they
all
wanted
to
know
what
was
amiss
when
the
old
man
had
made
sure
that
everybody
was
inside
he
closed
and
bolted
the
door
are
you
mad
to
be
running
about
when
you
hear
the
mountain
dog
at
that
moment
the
barking
was
heard
just
outside
the
hut
it
was
as
if
the
mountain
dog
were
chasing
round
and
round
the
house
emitting
hideous
yowls
is
it
a
real
dog
asked
a
young
rustic
you
can
go
out
and
call
to
it
if
you
like
nils
jansson
then
all
were
silent
listening
to
the
howling
thing
which
continued
to
go
round
and
round
without
a
stop
it
sounded
weird
and
dreadful
they
began
to
shudder
and
shake
and
some
turned
as
white
as
death
no
indeed
this
was
no
ordinary
dog
anybody
could
tell
that
it
was
doubtless
some
demon
let
loose
from
hell
they
thought
the
little
old
man
was
the
only
one
who
moved
about
first
he
closed
the
flue
then
he
went
around
and
snuffed
out
the
candles
no
no
cried
the
womenfolk
do
put
out
the
lights
you
must
let
me
do
what
is
best
for
all
of
us
said
the
old
man
one
of
the
girls
caught
hold
of
his
coat
is
the
mountain
dog
dangerous
she
asked
no
not
he
but
what
comes
after
and
what
comes
after
again
the
old
man
listened
presently
he
said
now
we
must
all
be
very
still
instantly
there
was
breathless
silence
once
again
the
terrible
howling
seemed
to
circle
the
hut
but
it
grew
less
distinct
as
it
went
across
the
marsh
and
up
the
mountains
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
then
came
an
ominous
stillness
presently
some
man
who
could
hold
in
any
longer
said
that
the
was
gone
without
a
word
strong
ingmar
raised
his
hand
and
dealt
the
man
a
blow
across
the
mouth
from
far
away
at
the
top
of
mount
flack
came
a
piercing
sound
it
was
like
a
howling
wind
but
it
could
also
have
been
a
blast
from
a
horn
now
and
again
prolonged
blare
could
be
heard
then
roaring
and
tramping
and
snorting
all
at
once
the
thing
came
dashing
down
from
the
mountain
with
an
awful
roar
they
could
tell
when
it
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
slope
they
could
tell
when
it
swept
the
skirt
of
the
forest
and
when
it
was
directly
above
them
it
was
like
the
rolling
of
thunder
across
the
face
of
the
earth
it
was
as
if
the
whole
mountain
had
come
tumbling
into
the
valley
when
it
seemed
to
be
almost
upon
them
every
head
went
down
it
will
crush
us
they
all
thought
it
will
surely
crush
us
but
what
they
felt
was
not
so
much
the
fear
of
death
as
terror
lest
it
might
be
the
prince
of
darkness
himself
coming
with
all
his
demons
what
frightened
them
most
were
the
shrieks
and
moans
that
could
be
heard
above
the
other
noises
there
were
wails
and
groans
laughter
and
bellowings
whines
and
hisses
when
that
which
they
had
supposed
was
a
big
thunderstorm
was
right
upon
them
it
seemed
to
be
a
mingling
of
groans
and
curses
of
sobs
and
angry
cries
of
the
blast
of
horns
of
crackling
fire
of
the
plaints
of
doomed
spirits
of
the
mocking
laughter
of
demons
of
the
flapping
of
huge
wings
they
thought
all
the
furies
of
the
infernal
regions
had
been
let
loose
that
night
and
would
overwhelm
them
the
ground
trembled
and
the
hut
swayed
as
if
it
were
going
to
topple
over
it
was
as
if
wild
horses
were
prancing
on
the
roof
as
if
howling
ghosts
rushed
past
the
door
and
as
if
owls
and
bats
were
beating
their
wings
against
the
chimney
while
this
was
happening
some
one
put
an
arm
around
waist
and
drew
her
to
her
knees
then
she
heard
ingmar
whisper
we
must
kneel
down
gertrude
and
ask
god
to
help
us
only
the
moment
before
gertrude
had
imagined
she
was
dying
so
terrible
was
the
fear
that
held
her
i
do
mind
having
to
die
she
thought
the
awful
part
of
it
is
that
the
powers
of
evil
are
hovering
over
us
but
gertrude
had
no
sooner
felt
ingmar
protecting
arm
around
her
than
her
heart
began
to
beat
once
more
and
the
feeling
of
numbness
in
her
limbs
was
gone
she
snuggled
close
to
him
she
was
not
frightened
now
how
wonderful
ingmar
must
have
felt
afraid
also
yet
he
was
able
to
impart
to
her
a
sense
of
security
and
protection
finally
the
terrible
noises
died
away
they
heard
only
the
faintest
echoes
of
them
in
the
distance
they
seemed
to
have
followed
in
the
trail
of
the
dog
down
through
the
marsh
and
up
into
the
mountain
passes
beyond
olaf
peak
and
yet
the
silence
in
strong
ingmar
but
was
unbroken
no
one
moved
no
one
spoke
at
times
it
was
as
if
fear
had
extinguished
all
life
there
now
and
then
through
the
stillness
a
deep
sigh
was
heard
no
one
moved
for
a
long
long
time
some
of
the
people
were
standing
up
against
the
walls
others
had
sunk
down
on
the
benches
but
most
of
them
were
kneeling
upon
the
floor
in
anxious
prayer
all
were
motionless
stunned
by
fear
thus
hour
after
hour
passed
and
during
that
time
there
was
many
a
one
in
that
room
who
ransacked
his
soul
and
resolved
to
live
a
new
life
nearer
to
god
and
farther
away
from
his
enemies
for
each
of
those
present
thought
it
is
something
that
have
done
which
has
brought
this
upon
us
this
has
happened
because
of
sins
i
could
hear
how
the
fiends
kept
calling
to
me
and
threatening
me
and
shrieking
my
name
as
they
rushed
by
as
for
gertrude
her
only
thought
was
i
know
now
that
i
can
never
live
without
ingmar
i
must
always
be
near
him
because
of
that
feeling
of
confidence
he
gives
one
then
gradually
the
day
began
to
break
the
faint
light
of
dawn
came
stealing
into
the
hut
revealing
the
many
blanched
faces
the
twitter
of
a
bird
was
heard
then
of
another
and
another
strong
ingmar
cow
began
to
low
for
her
breakfast
and
his
cat
who
never
slept
in
the
house
on
nights
when
there
was
dancing
came
to
the
door
and
mewed
but
no
one
inside
moved
until
the
sun
rolled
up
from
behind
the
eastern
hills
then
one
by
one
they
stole
out
without
a
word
or
even
a
outside
the
house
the
departing
guests
beheld
the
signs
of
the
night
devastation
a
huge
pine
which
had
stood
close
to
the
gate
had
been
torn
up
by
the
roots
and
thrown
down
branches
and
fence
posts
were
littered
over
the
ground
bats
and
owls
had
been
crushed
against
the
side
walls
of
the
hut
along
the
broad
roadway
leading
to
the
top
of
mount
klack
all
the
trees
had
been
blown
down
no
one
could
bear
to
look
at
this
long
so
they
all
hurried
on
toward
the
village
it
was
sunday
and
most
people
were
still
in
their
beds
but
a
few
persons
were
already
out
tending
to
their
cattle
an
old
man
had
just
emerged
from
his
house
with
his
sunday
coat
to
brush
and
air
it
from
another
house
came
father
mother
and
children
all
dressed
up
for
a
holiday
outing
it
was
a
great
relief
to
see
people
quietly
going
about
their
business
unconscious
of
the
awful
things
that
had
happened
in
the
forest
during
the
night
at
last
they
came
to
the
riverside
where
the
houses
were
less
scattered
and
then
to
the
village
they
were
glad
to
see
the
old
church
and
everything
else
it
was
comforting
to
see
that
everything
down
here
looked
natural
the
in
front
of
the
shop
creaked
on
its
hinges
as
usual
the
horn
was
in
its
regular
place
and
the
dog
lay
sleeping
as
always
outside
his
kennel
it
was
also
a
gladsome
surprise
to
them
to
see
a
little
bush
that
had
blossomed
overnight
and
the
green
seats
in
the
pastor
garden
which
must
have
been
put
out
late
in
the
evening
all
this
was
decidedly
reassuring
but
just
the
same
no
one
ventured
to
speak
until
they
had
reached
their
several
homes
when
gertrude
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
schoolhouse
she
said
to
ingmar
i
have
danced
my
last
dance
ingmar
and
i
too
ingmar
solemnly
declared
and
you
become
a
clergyman
wo
you
ingmar
and
if
you
become
a
preacher
you
must
at
least
be
a
teacher
there
is
so
much
evil
in
the
world
one
has
to
fight
against
ingmar
looked
straight
at
gertrude
what
did
those
voices
say
to
you
he
asked
they
said
that
i
had
been
caught
in
the
toils
of
sin
and
that
the
devil
would
come
and
take
me
because
i
was
so
fond
of
dancing
now
i
must
tell
you
what
i
heard
said
ingmar
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
the
old
ingmarssons
were
threatening
and
cursing
me
because
i
wanted
to
be
something
more
than
a
peasant
and
to
do
something
besides
just
tilling
the
soil
and
working
in
the
forest
hellgum
the
night
of
the
dance
at
strong
ingmar
tims
halvor
was
away
from
home
and
his
wife
karin
slept
alone
in
the
little
chamber
off
the
in
the
night
karin
had
a
frightful
dream
she
dreamt
that
elof
was
alive
and
was
holding
a
big
revel
she
could
hear
him
in
the
next
room
clinking
glasses
laughing
loudly
and
singing
ribald
songs
she
thought
in
the
dream
that
elof
and
his
boon
companions
were
getting
noisier
and
noisier
and
at
last
it
sounded
as
though
they
were
trying
to
break
up
both
tables
and
chairs
then
karin
became
so
frightened
that
she
awoke
but
even
after
she
had
awakened
the
noise
continued
the
earth
shook
the
windows
rattled
the
tiles
on
the
roof
were
loosened
and
the
old
pear
trees
at
the
gables
lashed
the
house
with
their
stout
branches
it
was
as
if
judgment
day
had
come
just
when
the
noise
was
at
its
height
a
window
pane
was
sprung
and
the
shattered
glass
fell
jingling
against
the
floor
a
violent
gust
of
wind
rushed
through
the
room
and
then
karin
thought
she
heard
a
laugh
quite
close
to
her
ear
the
same
kind
of
laugh
that
she
had
heard
in
the
dream
she
fancied
she
was
about
to
die
never
had
she
felt
such
a
sense
of
terror
her
heart
stopped
and
her
whole
body
became
numb
and
cold
as
ice
all
at
once
the
noise
died
down
and
karin
as
it
were
came
back
to
life
the
raw
night
wind
came
sweeping
into
the
room
so
after
a
little
karin
decided
to
get
up
and
stuff
something
into
the
broken
window
pane
as
she
stepped
out
of
the
bed
her
legs
gave
way
and
she
found
that
she
could
not
walk
she
did
not
cry
for
help
but
quietly
laid
down
again
i
surely
be
able
to
walk
when
i
feel
more
composed
she
thought
in
a
few
moments
she
made
another
attempt
this
time
too
her
legs
failed
her
and
she
fell
prone
on
the
floor
beside
the
bed
in
the
morning
when
people
were
astir
in
the
house
the
doctor
was
called
in
he
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
had
come
over
karin
she
did
not
appear
to
be
ill
nor
was
she
paralyzed
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
her
trouble
had
been
brought
on
by
fright
you
soon
be
all
right
again
he
assured
her
karin
listened
to
the
doctor
but
said
nothing
she
felt
certain
that
elof
had
been
in
the
room
during
the
night
and
that
he
was
the
cause
of
her
trouble
she
also
had
the
feeling
that
she
would
never
recover
from
this
shock
all
that
morning
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
brooded
she
tried
to
reason
out
why
god
had
let
this
trial
come
upon
her
she
examined
her
conscience
thoroughly
but
could
not
discover
that
she
had
committed
any
special
sin
that
merited
such
a
terrible
punishment
god
is
unjust
to
me
she
thought
in
the
afternoon
she
was
taken
to
storm
mission
house
where
at
that
time
a
lay
preacher
named
dagson
led
the
meetings
she
hoped
that
he
could
tell
her
why
she
had
been
punished
in
this
way
dagson
was
a
popular
speaker
and
never
had
he
had
so
many
hearers
as
on
that
afternoon
my
but
what
a
gathering
of
people
down
at
the
mission
house
and
no
one
talked
of
anything
but
what
had
happened
in
the
night
at
strong
ingmar
hut
the
whole
community
was
in
a
state
of
terror
and
had
turned
out
in
full
force
in
order
to
hear
the
word
of
god
preached
with
a
force
that
would
annihilate
their
fears
hardly
a
quarter
of
the
people
could
get
inside
but
windows
and
doors
were
wide
open
and
dagson
had
such
a
powerful
voice
that
he
could
be
heard
even
by
those
on
the
outside
of
course
he
knew
what
had
occurred
and
what
the
people
wanted
to
hear
he
opened
his
address
with
a
word
picture
of
hell
and
the
prince
of
darkness
he
reminded
them
of
the
evil
one
who
skulks
about
in
the
dark
to
capture
souls
who
lays
the
snares
of
sin
and
sets
the
traps
of
vice
the
people
shuddered
they
seemed
to
see
a
world
full
of
devils
tempting
and
enticing
them
to
destruction
everything
was
a
sin
and
a
danger
they
were
wandering
among
pitfalls
hunted
and
tormented
like
the
wild
beasts
of
the
forest
when
dagson
talked
in
this
strain
his
voice
pierced
the
room
like
a
blasting
wind
and
his
words
were
like
tongues
of
fire
all
who
heard
dagson
sermon
likened
it
to
a
roaring
torrent
of
flame
with
all
this
talk
about
demons
and
fire
and
smoke
they
had
the
same
feeling
as
when
trapped
in
a
burning
forest
when
the
fire
creeps
along
the
moss
upon
which
you
are
treading
and
smoke
clouds
fill
the
air
you
breathe
and
the
heat
singes
your
hair
while
the
roar
of
the
fire
fills
your
ears
and
flying
sparks
set
fire
to
your
clothing
thus
did
dagson
drive
the
people
through
flame
and
smoke
and
desolation
they
had
fire
in
front
of
them
fire
behind
them
and
fire
to
left
and
right
of
them
and
saw
only
destruction
ahead
of
them
yet
after
taking
them
through
all
these
horrors
he
finally
led
them
to
a
green
spot
in
the
forest
where
it
was
peaceful
and
cool
and
safe
in
the
centre
of
a
flowery
meadow
sat
jesus
with
his
arms
outstretched
toward
the
fleeing
and
hunted
men
and
women
who
cast
themselves
at
his
feet
now
all
danger
was
past
and
they
suffered
no
further
distress
nor
persecution
dagson
spoke
as
he
himself
felt
if
he
could
only
lay
himself
down
at
jesus
feet
a
sense
of
great
peace
and
serenity
would
come
to
him
and
he
had
no
more
fear
of
the
snares
of
the
world
after
the
service
there
was
great
emotional
excitement
many
persons
rushed
up
to
the
speaker
and
thanked
him
with
tears
streaming
down
their
faces
they
told
him
that
his
words
had
awakened
them
to
a
true
faith
in
god
but
all
this
time
karin
sat
unmoved
when
dagson
had
finished
speaking
she
raised
her
heavy
eyelids
and
looked
up
at
him
as
if
reproaching
him
for
not
having
given
her
anything
just
then
some
one
outside
cried
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
entire
congregation
woe
woe
woe
to
those
who
give
stones
for
bread
woe
woe
woe
to
those
who
give
stones
for
bread
whereupon
everybody
rushed
out
curious
to
see
who
it
was
that
had
spoken
those
words
and
karin
was
left
sitting
there
in
her
helplessness
presently
members
of
her
own
household
came
back
and
told
her
that
the
person
who
had
cried
out
like
that
was
a
tall
dark
stranger
he
and
a
pretty
woman
had
been
seen
coming
down
the
road
in
a
cart
during
the
service
they
had
stopped
to
listen
and
just
as
they
were
about
to
drive
on
the
man
had
risen
up
and
spoken
some
folks
thought
they
knew
the
woman
they
said
she
was
one
of
strong
ingmar
daughters
one
of
those
who
had
gone
to
america
and
married
there
the
man
was
evidently
her
husband
of
course
it
is
not
so
easy
to
recognize
a
person
whom
one
has
known
as
a
young
girl
in
the
ordinary
peasant
costume
when
she
comes
back
a
grown
woman
dressed
up
in
city
clothes
karin
and
the
stranger
were
evidently
of
the
same
mind
regarding
dagson
karin
never
went
to
the
mission
house
again
but
later
in
the
summer
when
a
baptist
layman
came
to
the
parish
baptizing
and
exhorting
she
went
to
hear
him
and
when
the
salvation
army
began
to
hold
meetings
in
the
village
she
also
attended
one
of
these
the
parish
was
in
the
throes
of
a
great
religious
upheaval
at
all
the
meetings
there
were
awakenings
and
conversions
the
people
seemed
to
find
what
they
had
been
seeking
yet
among
all
those
whom
karin
had
heard
preach
not
one
could
give
her
any
consolation
a
blacksmith
named
birger
larsson
had
a
smithy
close
by
the
highroad
his
shop
was
small
and
dark
with
a
low
door
and
an
aperture
in
place
of
a
window
birger
larsson
made
common
knives
mended
locks
put
tires
on
wheels
and
on
sled
runners
when
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
he
forged
nails
one
evening
in
the
summer
there
was
a
rush
of
work
at
the
smithy
at
one
anvil
stood
birger
larsson
flattening
the
heads
of
nails
his
eldest
son
was
at
another
anvil
forging
iron
rods
and
cutting
off
pins
a
second
son
was
blowing
the
bellows
a
third
carried
coal
to
the
forge
turned
the
iron
and
when
at
white
heat
brought
it
to
the
smiths
the
fourth
son
who
was
not
more
than
seven
years
old
gathered
up
the
finished
nails
and
threw
them
into
a
trough
filled
with
water
afterward
bunching
and
tying
them
while
they
were
all
hard
at
work
a
stranger
came
up
and
stationed
himself
in
the
doorway
he
was
a
tall
man
and
he
had
to
bend
almost
double
to
look
in
birger
larsson
glanced
up
from
his
work
to
see
what
the
man
wanted
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
looking
in
although
i
have
no
special
errand
here
said
the
stranger
i
was
a
blacksmith
myself
in
my
younger
days
and
can
never
pass
by
a
smithy
without
first
stopping
to
glance
in
at
the
work
birger
larsson
noticed
that
the
man
had
large
sinewy
hands
regular
blacksmith
hands
he
at
once
began
to
question
him
as
to
who
he
was
and
whence
he
came
the
man
answered
pleasantly
but
without
disclosing
his
identity
birger
thought
him
clever
and
likable
and
after
showing
him
around
the
shop
he
went
outside
with
him
and
began
to
brag
about
his
sons
he
had
seen
hard
times
he
said
before
the
boys
were
big
enough
to
help
with
the
work
but
now
that
all
of
them
were
able
to
lend
a
hand
everything
went
well
in
a
few
years
i
expect
to
be
a
rich
man
he
declared
the
stranger
smiled
a
little
at
that
and
said
he
was
pleased
to
hear
that
birger
sons
were
so
helpful
to
him
placing
his
heavy
hand
on
birger
shoulder
and
looking
him
square
in
the
eyes
he
said
since
you
have
had
such
good
aid
from
your
sons
in
a
material
way
i
suppose
you
also
let
them
help
you
in
the
things
that
pertain
to
the
spirit
birger
stared
stupidly
i
see
that
this
is
a
new
thought
to
you
the
stranger
added
ponder
it
till
we
meet
again
then
he
went
on
his
way
smiling
and
birger
larsson
scratching
his
head
returned
to
his
work
but
the
stranger
query
haunted
his
mind
for
several
days
i
wonder
what
made
him
say
that
he
mused
there
must
be
something
back
of
it
all
that
i
do
understand
the
day
after
the
stranger
had
talked
with
birger
larsson
an
extraordinary
thing
took
place
at
tims
halvor
old
shop
which
since
his
marriage
to
karin
had
been
turned
over
to
his
bullet
gunner
gunner
was
away
at
the
time
and
in
his
absence
brita
ingmarsson
tended
the
shop
brita
was
named
after
her
mother
big
ingmar
handsome
wife
whose
good
looks
she
had
inherited
moreover
she
had
the
distinction
of
being
the
prettiest
girl
ever
born
and
reared
on
the
ingmar
farm
although
she
bore
no
outward
resemblance
to
the
old
ingmars
she
was
nevertheless
quite
as
conscientious
and
upright
as
any
of
them
when
gunner
was
absent
brita
always
ran
the
business
in
her
own
way
whenever
old
corporal
felt
would
come
stumbling
in
tipsy
and
shaky
and
ask
for
a
bottle
of
beer
brita
would
give
him
a
blunt
no
and
when
poor
kolbjörn
lena
came
and
wanted
to
buy
a
fine
brooch
brita
sent
her
home
with
several
pounds
of
rye
meal
the
peasant
woman
who
dropped
in
to
buy
some
light
flimsy
fabric
was
told
to
go
home
and
weave
suitable
and
durable
cloth
on
her
own
loom
and
no
children
dared
come
into
the
shop
to
spend
their
poor
coppers
for
candy
and
raisins
when
brita
was
in
charge
there
that
day
brita
had
not
many
customers
so
for
hours
and
hours
she
sat
quite
alone
staring
into
vacancy
despair
burning
in
her
eyes
by
and
by
she
got
up
and
took
out
a
rope
then
she
moved
a
little
stepladder
from
the
shop
into
the
back
room
after
that
she
made
a
loop
in
one
end
of
the
rope
and
fastened
the
other
end
to
a
hook
in
the
ceiling
just
as
she
was
about
to
slip
her
head
into
the
noose
she
happened
to
look
down
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
a
tall
dark
man
he
had
evidently
entered
the
shop
without
her
having
heard
him
and
on
finding
no
one
in
attendance
had
stepped
behind
the
counter
and
opened
the
door
to
the
next
room
brita
quietly
came
down
from
the
ladder
the
man
did
not
speak
but
withdrew
into
the
shop
brita
slowly
following
him
she
had
never
seen
the
man
before
she
noticed
that
he
had
black
curly
hair
throat
whiskers
keen
eyes
and
big
sinewy
hands
he
was
well
dressed
but
his
bearing
was
that
of
a
labourer
after
seating
himself
on
a
rickety
chair
near
the
door
he
began
to
stare
hard
at
brita
by
that
time
brita
was
again
standing
behind
the
counter
she
did
not
ask
him
what
he
wanted
she
only
wished
he
would
go
away
the
man
just
stared
and
stared
never
once
taking
his
eyes
off
her
brita
felt
that
she
was
being
held
by
his
gaze
and
could
not
move
presently
she
grew
impatient
and
said
in
her
mind
what
the
use
of
your
sitting
there
watching
me
ca
you
understand
that
i
going
to
do
what
i
want
to
do
anyhow
as
soon
as
i
left
alone
if
this
were
only
something
that
could
be
helped
brita
argued
mentally
i
would
mind
your
hindering
me
but
it
be
remedied
now
all
the
while
the
man
sat
gazing
intently
at
her
let
me
say
to
you
that
we
ingmars
are
not
fitted
to
be
shopkeepers
brita
continued
in
her
thoughts
you
do
know
how
happy
we
were
gunner
and
i
till
he
took
up
with
this
business
folks
certainly
warned
me
against
marrying
him
they
did
like
him
on
account
of
his
black
hair
his
piercing
eyes
and
his
sharp
tongue
but
we
two
were
fond
of
each
other
you
see
and
there
was
never
a
cross
word
between
us
till
gunner
took
over
the
shop
but
since
then
all
has
not
been
well
i
want
him
to
conduct
the
business
in
my
way
i
ca
abide
his
selling
wine
and
beer
to
drunkards
and
it
seems
to
me
that
he
ought
to
encourage
people
in
buying
only
such
things
as
are
useful
and
necessary
but
gunner
thinks
this
a
ridiculous
notion
neither
of
us
will
give
in
to
the
other
so
we
are
forever
wrangling
and
now
he
does
care
for
me
any
more
she
gave
the
man
a
savage
look
amazed
at
his
not
yielding
to
her
mute
entreaties
surely
you
must
understand
that
i
can
not
go
on
living
under
the
shame
of
knowing
that
he
lets
the
bailiff
serve
executions
upon
poor
people
and
take
from
them
their
only
cow
or
a
couple
of
sheep
ca
you
see
that
this
thing
will
never
come
right
why
do
you
go
and
let
me
put
an
end
to
it
all
brita
under
the
man
gaze
gradually
became
quieter
in
her
mind
and
in
a
little
while
she
began
to
cry
softly
she
was
touched
by
his
sitting
there
and
protecting
her
against
herself
as
soon
as
the
man
saw
that
brita
was
weeping
he
rose
and
went
toward
the
door
when
he
was
on
the
doorstep
he
turned
and
again
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
and
said
in
a
deep
voice
do
thyself
no
harm
for
the
time
is
nearing
when
thou
shalt
live
in
righteousness
then
he
went
his
way
she
could
hear
his
heavy
footsteps
as
he
walked
down
the
road
brita
ran
into
the
little
room
took
down
the
rope
and
carried
the
stepladder
back
into
the
shop
then
she
dropped
down
on
a
box
where
she
sat
quietly
musing
for
two
full
hours
she
felt
somehow
that
for
a
long
time
she
had
wandered
in
a
darkness
so
thick
that
she
could
not
see
her
hand
before
her
she
had
lost
her
way
and
knew
not
whither
she
had
strayed
and
with
every
step
she
had
been
afraid
of
sinking
into
a
quagmire
or
stumbling
headlong
into
an
abyss
now
some
one
had
called
to
her
not
to
go
any
farther
but
to
sit
down
and
wait
for
the
break
of
day
she
was
glad
that
she
would
not
have
to
continue
her
perilous
wanderings
now
she
sat
quietly
waiting
for
the
dawn
strong
ingmar
had
a
daughter
who
was
called
anna
lisa
she
had
lived
in
chicago
for
a
number
of
years
and
had
married
there
a
swede
named
john
hellgum
who
was
the
leader
of
a
little
band
of
religionists
with
a
faith
and
doctrine
of
their
own
the
day
after
the
memorable
dance
night
at
strong
ingmar
anna
lisa
and
her
husband
had
come
home
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
old
father
hellgum
passed
his
time
taking
long
walks
about
the
parish
he
struck
up
an
acquaintance
with
all
whom
he
met
on
the
way
he
talked
with
them
at
first
of
commonplace
things
but
just
before
parting
with
a
person
he
would
always
place
his
large
hand
upon
his
or
her
shoulder
and
speak
a
few
words
of
comfort
or
warning
strong
ingmar
saw
very
little
of
his
for
that
summer
the
old
man
and
young
ingmar
who
had
now
gone
back
to
the
ingmar
farm
to
live
were
hard
at
work
daytimes
putting
up
a
sawmill
below
the
rapids
it
was
a
proud
day
for
strong
ingmar
when
the
sawmill
was
ready
and
the
first
log
had
been
turned
into
white
planks
by
the
buzzing
saws
one
evening
on
his
way
home
from
work
the
old
man
met
anna
lisa
on
the
road
she
looked
frightened
and
wanted
to
run
away
strong
ingmar
seeing
this
quickened
his
pace
thinking
all
was
not
well
at
home
when
he
reached
his
but
he
stopped
short
frowning
as
far
back
as
he
could
remember
a
certain
rosebush
had
been
growing
outside
the
door
it
had
been
the
apple
of
his
eye
he
had
never
allowed
any
one
to
pluck
a
rose
or
a
leaf
from
that
bush
strong
ingmar
had
always
guarded
the
bush
very
tenderly
because
he
believed
it
sheltered
elves
and
fairies
but
now
it
had
been
cut
down
of
course
it
was
his
the
preacher
who
had
done
this
as
the
sight
of
the
bush
had
always
been
an
eyesore
to
him
strong
ingmar
had
his
axe
with
him
and
his
grip
on
the
handle
tightened
as
he
entered
the
hut
inside
sat
hellgum
with
an
open
bible
before
him
he
raised
his
eyes
and
gave
the
old
man
a
piercing
look
then
went
on
with
his
reading
this
time
aloud
even
as
ye
think
we
will
be
as
the
heathen
as
the
families
of
the
countries
to
serve
wood
and
stone
it
shall
not
be
at
all
as
ye
think
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
surely
with
a
mighty
hand
and
with
arm
and
with
fury
poured
out
will
i
rule
over
you
without
a
word
strong
ingmar
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
house
that
night
he
slept
in
the
barn
the
following
day
he
and
ingmar
ingmarsson
set
out
for
the
forest
to
burn
charcoal
and
fell
timber
they
were
to
be
gone
the
whole
winter
on
two
or
three
occasions
hellgum
had
spoken
at
prayer
meetings
and
outlined
his
teaching
which
he
maintained
was
the
only
true
christianity
but
hellgum
who
was
not
as
eloquent
a
speaker
as
dagson
had
made
no
converts
those
who
had
met
him
outside
and
had
only
heard
him
say
a
few
telling
words
expected
great
things
from
him
but
when
he
tried
to
deliver
a
lengthy
address
he
became
heavy
prosy
and
tiresome
toward
the
close
of
summer
karin
became
utterly
despondent
over
her
condition
she
rarely
spoke
all
day
long
she
sat
motionless
in
her
chair
she
went
to
hear
no
more
preachers
but
stayed
at
home
brooding
over
her
misfortune
once
in
a
while
she
would
repeat
to
halvor
her
father
old
saying
about
the
ingmars
not
having
anything
to
fear
so
long
as
they
walked
in
the
ways
of
god
now
she
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
truth
even
in
that
halvor
not
knowing
what
to
do
on
one
occasion
suggested
that
she
talk
with
the
newest
preacher
but
karin
declared
that
she
would
never
again
look
to
a
parson
for
help
one
sunday
toward
the
end
of
august
karin
sat
at
the
window
in
the
a
sabbath
stillness
rested
over
the
farm
and
she
could
hardly
keep
awake
her
head
kept
sinking
nearer
and
nearer
her
breast
and
presently
she
dropped
into
a
doze
she
was
suddenly
awakened
by
the
sound
of
a
voice
just
outside
her
window
she
could
not
see
who
the
speaker
was
but
the
voice
was
strong
and
deep
a
more
beautiful
voice
she
had
never
heard
i
know
halvor
that
it
does
seem
reasonable
to
you
that
a
poor
uneducated
blacksmith
should
have
found
the
truth
when
so
many
learned
men
have
failed
said
the
voice
i
do
see
how
you
can
be
so
sure
of
that
halvor
questioned
it
hellgum
talking
to
halvor
thought
karin
trying
to
close
the
window
which
she
was
unable
to
reach
it
has
been
said
as
you
know
hellgum
went
on
that
if
somebody
strikes
us
on
one
cheek
we
must
turn
the
other
cheek
also
and
that
we
should
not
resist
evil
and
other
things
of
the
same
sort
all
of
which
none
of
us
can
live
up
to
why
people
would
rob
you
of
your
house
and
home
they
steal
your
potatoes
and
carry
off
your
grain
if
you
failed
to
protect
what
was
yours
i
guess
they
take
the
whole
ingmar
farm
from
you
maybe
you
right
halvor
admitted
well
then
i
suppose
christ
did
mean
anything
when
he
said
all
that
he
was
just
talking
into
the
air
eh
i
do
know
what
you
driving
at
said
halvor
now
here
something
to
set
you
thinking
hellgum
continued
we
are
supposed
to
be
very
far
advanced
in
our
christianity
no
one
nowadays
who
steals
no
one
who
commits
murder
or
wrongs
the
widow
and
the
fatherless
and
of
course
no
one
hates
or
persecutes
his
neighbour
any
more
and
it
would
occur
to
any
of
us
who
have
such
a
good
religion
to
do
any
wrong
there
are
many
things
that
are
just
as
they
ought
to
be
drawled
halvor
he
sounded
sleepy
and
anything
but
interested
now
if
you
had
a
threshing
machine
that
would
work
you
find
out
what
was
wrong
with
it
you
would
give
yourself
any
rest
till
you
had
discovered
wherein
it
was
faulty
but
when
you
see
that
it
is
simply
impossible
to
get
people
to
lead
a
christian
life
should
you
try
to
find
out
whether
there
is
anything
the
matter
with
christianity
itself
i
ca
believe
there
are
any
flaws
in
the
teachings
of
jesus
said
halvor
no
they
were
unquestionably
sound
from
the
start
but
it
may
be
that
they
have
become
a
little
rusty
as
it
were
from
neglect
in
any
perfect
mechanism
if
a
cog
happens
to
slip
only
one
tiny
little
cog
instantly
the
whole
machinery
stops
he
paused
a
moment
as
if
searching
for
words
and
proofs
now
let
me
tell
you
what
happened
to
me
a
few
years
ago
he
resumed
i
then
tried
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
to
really
live
by
the
teachings
do
you
know
what
the
result
was
i
was
at
that
time
working
in
a
factory
when
my
found
out
what
manner
of
man
i
was
they
let
me
do
a
good
share
of
their
work
in
addition
to
my
own
in
thanks
they
took
the
job
away
from
me
by
conniving
to
throw
the
blame
on
me
for
a
theft
committed
by
one
of
them
i
was
arrested
of
course
and
sent
to
the
penitentiary
one
does
ordinarily
run
across
such
bad
people
returned
halvor
indifferently
then
said
i
to
myself
it
would
be
very
hard
to
be
a
christian
if
one
were
only
alone
on
this
earth
and
there
were
no
fellow
humans
to
be
reckoned
with
i
must
confess
that
i
really
enjoyed
being
in
prison
for
there
i
was
allowed
to
lead
a
righteous
life
undisturbed
and
unmolested
but
after
a
time
i
began
to
think
that
this
trying
to
be
good
in
solitude
was
about
as
effective
as
the
automatic
turning
of
a
mill
when
there
no
corn
in
the
grinder
inasmuch
as
god
had
seen
fit
to
place
so
many
people
in
the
world
i
reasoned
it
must
have
been
done
with
the
idea
that
they
should
be
a
help
and
a
comfort
to
one
another
and
not
a
menace
it
occurred
tome
finally
that
satan
must
have
taken
something
away
from
the
bible
so
that
christianity
should
go
to
smash
but
surely
he
never
had
the
power
to
do
that
said
halvor
yes
he
has
taken
out
this
precept
who
would
lead
a
christian
life
must
seek
help
among
your
halvor
did
not
venture
a
reply
but
karin
nodded
approvingly
she
had
listened
very
carefully
and
had
not
missed
a
word
as
soon
as
i
was
released
from
prison
hellgum
continued
i
went
to
see
an
old
friend
and
asked
him
to
help
me
lead
a
righteous
life
and
mind
when
we
were
two
about
it
at
once
it
became
easier
soon
a
third
party
joined
with
us
then
a
fourth
and
it
became
easier
and
easier
now
there
are
thirty
of
us
who
live
together
in
a
house
in
chicago
all
our
interests
are
common
interests
we
share
and
share
alike
we
watch
over
each
lives
and
the
way
of
righteousness
lies
before
us
smooth
and
even
we
are
able
to
deal
with
one
another
in
a
christly
manner
for
one
brother
does
not
abuse
the
kindness
of
another
nor
trample
him
down
in
his
humility
as
halvor
remained
silent
hellgum
spoke
on
convincingly
you
know
of
course
that
he
who
wishes
to
do
something
big
always
allies
himself
with
others
who
help
him
now
you
could
run
this
farm
by
yourself
if
you
wanted
to
start
a
factory
you
have
to
organize
a
company
to
coöperate
with
you
and
if
you
wanted
to
build
a
railway
just
think
how
many
helpers
you
have
to
take
on
but
the
most
difficult
work
in
the
world
is
to
live
a
christian
life
yet
that
you
would
accomplish
and
without
the
support
of
others
or
maybe
you
do
even
try
to
do
so
since
you
know
beforehand
that
it
ca
be
done
but
we
i
and
those
who
have
joined
me
back
there
in
chicago
have
found
a
way
our
little
community
is
in
truth
the
new
jerusalem
come
down
from
heaven
you
may
know
it
by
these
signs
the
gifts
of
the
spirit
which
descended
upon
the
early
christians
have
also
fallen
upon
us
there
are
some
among
us
who
hear
the
voice
of
god
others
who
prophesy
and
others
again
who
heal
the
sick
can
you
heal
the
sick
halvor
broke
in
eagerly
yes
answered
hellgum
i
can
heal
those
who
have
faith
in
me
it
rather
hard
to
believe
something
different
from
what
one
was
taught
as
a
child
said
halvor
thoughtfully
nevertheless
i
feel
certain
halvor
that
very
soon
you
will
give
your
full
support
to
the
upbuilding
of
the
new
jerusalem
hellgum
declared
then
came
a
moment
of
silence
after
which
karin
heard
hellgum
say
presently
halvor
went
into
the
house
on
seeing
karin
seated
by
the
open
window
he
remarked
you
must
have
heard
all
that
hellgum
said
yes
she
replied
did
you
hear
him
say
that
he
could
heal
any
one
who
had
faith
in
him
karin
reddened
a
little
she
had
liked
what
hellgum
said
better
than
anything
she
had
heard
that
summer
there
was
something
sound
and
practical
about
his
teaching
which
appealed
to
her
common
sense
here
were
works
and
service
and
no
mere
emotionalism
which
meant
nothing
to
her
however
she
would
not
admit
this
for
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
have
no
further
dealings
with
preachers
so
she
said
to
halvor
my
father
faith
is
good
enough
for
me
a
fortnight
later
karin
was
again
seated
in
the
autumn
had
just
set
in
the
wind
howled
round
the
house
and
a
fire
crackled
on
the
hearth
there
was
nobody
in
the
room
but
herself
and
her
baby
daughter
who
was
almost
a
year
old
and
had
just
learned
to
walk
the
child
was
sitting
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
playing
as
karin
sat
watching
the
child
the
door
opened
and
in
came
a
tall
dark
man
with
keen
eyes
and
large
sinewy
hands
before
karin
had
heard
him
say
a
word
she
guessed
that
it
was
hellgum
after
passing
the
time
of
day
the
man
asked
after
halvor
he
learned
that
karin
husband
had
gone
to
a
town
meeting
and
was
expected
home
shortly
hellgum
sat
down
now
and
then
he
glanced
over
at
karin
and
after
a
little
he
said
i
been
told
that
you
are
i
have
not
been
able
to
walk
for
the
past
six
months
karin
replied
i
have
been
thinking
of
coming
here
to
pray
for
you
volunteered
the
preacher
karin
closed
her
eyes
and
retired
within
herself
you
have
perhaps
heard
that
by
the
grace
of
god
i
am
able
to
heal
the
sick
the
woman
opened
her
eyes
and
sent
him
a
look
of
distrust
much
obliged
to
you
for
thinking
of
me
she
said
but
it
likely
that
you
can
help
me
as
i
not
the
kind
that
changes
faith
easily
possibly
god
will
help
you
anyhow
since
you
have
always
tried
to
live
an
upright
life
i
afraid
i
do
stand
well
enough
in
the
sight
of
god
to
expect
help
from
him
in
this
matter
in
a
little
while
hellgum
asked
her
if
she
had
looked
within
to
get
at
the
cause
of
this
affliction
has
mother
karin
ever
asked
herself
why
this
affliction
has
been
visited
upon
her
karin
made
no
reply
again
she
seemed
to
retire
within
herself
something
tells
me
that
god
has
done
this
that
his
name
might
be
glorified
said
hellgum
at
that
karin
grew
angry
and
two
bright
red
spots
appeared
in
her
cheeks
she
thought
it
very
presumptuous
in
hellgum
to
think
this
illness
had
come
upon
her
simply
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
perform
a
miracle
presently
the
preacher
got
up
and
went
over
to
karin
placing
his
heavy
hand
on
her
head
he
asked
do
you
want
me
to
pray
for
you
karin
immediately
felt
a
current
of
life
and
health
shoot
through
her
body
but
she
was
so
offended
at
the
man
for
his
obtrusiveness
that
she
pushed
away
his
hand
and
raised
her
own
as
if
to
strike
him
her
indignation
was
beyond
words
hellgum
withdrew
toward
the
door
one
should
not
reject
the
help
which
god
sends
but
accept
it
thankfully
that
true
karin
returned
whatever
god
sends
one
is
obliged
to
accept
mark
well
what
i
say
to
you
this
day
shall
salvation
come
unto
this
house
the
man
proclaimed
karin
did
not
answer
think
of
me
when
you
receive
the
help
he
said
the
next
instant
he
was
gone
karin
sat
bolt
upright
in
her
chair
the
red
spots
still
burning
in
her
cheeks
am
i
to
have
no
peace
even
in
my
own
house
she
muttered
it
singular
how
many
there
are
nowadays
who
think
themselves
sent
of
god
suddenly
karin
little
girl
got
up
and
toddled
toward
the
fireplace
the
bright
blaze
had
attracted
the
child
who
shrieking
with
delight
was
making
for
it
as
fast
as
her
tiny
feet
could
carry
her
karin
called
to
her
to
come
back
but
the
child
paid
no
heed
to
her
at
that
moment
she
was
trying
to
clamber
up
into
the
fireplace
after
tumbling
down
a
couple
of
times
she
finally
managed
to
get
upon
the
hearth
where
the
fire
blazed
god
help
me
god
help
me
cried
karin
then
she
began
to
shout
for
help
although
she
knew
there
was
no
one
near
the
little
girl
bent
laughingly
over
the
fire
suddenly
a
burning
ember
rolled
out
and
fell
on
her
little
yellow
frock
instantly
karin
sprang
to
her
feet
rushed
over
to
the
fireplace
and
snatched
the
child
in
her
arms
not
until
she
had
brushed
away
all
the
sparks
from
the
child
dress
and
had
made
sure
that
her
baby
was
unharmed
did
she
realize
what
had
happened
to
herself
she
was
actually
on
her
feet
she
had
been
walking
again
and
would
always
be
able
to
walk
karin
experienced
the
greatest
mental
she
had
ever
felt
in
her
life
and
at
the
same
time
the
greatest
sense
of
happiness
she
had
the
feeling
that
she
was
under
god
special
care
and
protection
and
that
god
himself
had
sent
a
holy
man
to
her
house
to
strengthen
her
and
to
heal
her
that
autumn
hellgum
often
stood
on
the
little
porch
of
strong
ingmar
cottage
looking
out
across
the
landscape
the
country
round
about
was
growing
more
beautiful
every
day
the
ground
was
now
a
golden
brown
and
all
the
leafy
trees
had
turned
either
a
bright
red
or
a
bright
yellow
here
and
there
loomed
stretches
of
woodland
that
shimmered
in
the
breeze
like
a
billowy
sea
of
gold
against
the
shadowy
background
of
the
hills
could
be
seen
splashes
of
yellow
they
were
the
leaf
trees
that
had
strayed
in
among
the
pines
and
spruces
and
taken
root
there
as
an
humble
gray
hut
when
ablaze
gives
out
light
and
brilliancy
thus
did
this
humble
swedish
landscape
flame
into
a
marvel
of
splendour
everything
was
so
wondrously
golden
exactly
as
one
might
imagine
that
a
landscape
on
the
surface
of
the
sun
would
look
hellgum
was
thinking
as
he
viewed
this
scene
that
a
time
was
coming
when
god
would
let
the
land
reflect
the
brightness
of
his
glory
and
when
the
seeds
of
truth
which
had
been
sawn
during
the
summer
would
yield
golden
harvests
of
righteousness
then
to
and
behold
one
evening
tims
halvor
came
over
to
the
croft
and
invited
hellgum
and
his
wife
to
come
with
him
to
the
ingmar
farm
on
arriving
they
found
everything
in
holiday
order
around
the
house
all
the
old
dry
birch
leaves
had
been
cleared
away
farm
implements
and
carts
which
at
other
times
were
scattered
about
the
yard
had
now
been
put
out
of
sight
they
must
be
having
a
number
of
visitors
here
thought
anna
lisa
just
then
halvor
opened
the
front
door
and
they
stepped
inside
the
was
full
of
people
who
were
seated
upon
benches
all
along
the
walls
solemnly
expectant
hellgum
noticed
that
they
were
the
leading
people
of
the
parish
the
first
persons
he
recognized
were
ljung
björn
olofsson
and
his
wife
martha
ingmarsson
also
bullet
gunner
and
his
wife
then
he
saw
krister
larsson
and
israel
tomasson
with
their
wives
all
of
whom
were
members
of
the
ingmar
family
presently
he
saw
hök
matts
ericsson
and
his
son
gabriel
the
councillor
daughter
gunhild
and
several
persons
besides
altogether
there
were
about
twenty
people
present
when
hellgum
and
anna
lisa
had
gone
round
and
shaken
hands
with
every
one
tims
halvor
said
we
who
are
assembled
here
have
been
thinking
over
the
things
hellgum
has
said
to
us
during
the
summer
most
of
us
belong
to
an
old
family
whose
wish
it
has
ever
been
to
walk
in
the
ways
of
god
if
hellgum
can
help
us
do
this
we
are
ready
to
follow
him
the
next
day
the
news
spread
like
wildfire
throughout
the
parish
that
a
new
religious
sect
had
sprung
up
on
the
ingmar
farm
which
was
supposed
to
embody
the
only
correct
and
true
principles
of
christianity
the
new
way
in
the
spring
soon
after
the
snow
had
disappeared
young
ingmar
and
strong
ingmar
returned
to
the
village
to
start
the
sawmill
they
had
been
up
in
the
forest
the
whole
winter
cutting
timber
and
making
charcoal
and
when
ingmar
got
back
to
the
lowlands
he
fell
like
a
bear
that
had
just
crawled
out
from
its
lair
he
could
hardly
accustom
himself
to
the
glaring
sunlight
of
an
open
sky
and
blinked
as
if
the
light
hurt
him
the
roaring
of
the
rapids
and
the
sound
of
human
voices
seemed
almost
intolerable
to
him
and
all
the
noises
on
the
farm
were
a
veritable
torture
to
his
ears
at
the
same
time
he
was
glad
heaven
knows
he
did
not
show
it
either
in
speech
or
manner
but
that
spring
he
felt
as
young
as
the
fresh
shoots
on
the
birches
oh
but
it
seemed
good
to
him
to
sleep
once
more
in
a
comfortable
bed
and
to
eat
properly
cooked
food
and
then
to
be
at
home
with
karin
who
looked
after
his
comfort
as
tenderly
as
a
mother
she
had
ordered
new
clothes
for
him
and
she
had
a
way
of
coming
in
from
the
kitchen
and
handing
him
some
dainty
or
other
as
if
he
were
still
a
little
boy
and
what
wonderful
things
had
happened
at
home
while
he
was
up
in
the
forest
ingmar
had
heard
only
a
few
vague
rumours
about
hellgum
teachings
but
now
karin
and
halvor
told
him
of
the
great
happiness
that
had
come
to
them
and
of
how
they
and
their
friends
were
trying
to
help
one
another
to
walk
in
the
ways
of
god
we
are
sure
you
will
want
to
join
us
said
karin
ingmar
replied
that
maybe
he
would
but
that
he
must
think
it
over
first
all
winter
i
longed
for
you
to
come
home
and
share
our
bliss
the
sister
went
on
for
now
we
no
longer
live
upon
earth
but
in
new
jerusalem
which
is
come
down
from
heaven
ingmar
said
he
was
glad
to
hear
that
hellgum
was
still
in
the
neighbourhood
the
summer
before
the
preacher
had
often
dropped
in
at
the
mill
to
chat
with
ingmar
and
the
two
had
become
good
friends
ingmar
thought
him
the
finest
chap
he
had
ever
met
never
had
he
come
across
any
one
who
was
so
much
of
a
man
so
firm
in
his
convictions
and
so
sure
of
himself
sometimes
when
there
had
been
a
great
rush
of
work
at
the
mill
hellgum
had
pulled
off
his
coat
and
given
them
a
lift
ingmar
had
been
amazed
at
the
cleverness
he
had
never
seen
any
one
who
was
so
quick
at
his
work
just
then
hellgum
happened
to
be
away
for
a
few
days
but
was
expected
back
shortly
once
you
talked
with
hellgum
i
think
that
you
will
join
us
karin
said
ingmar
thought
so
too
although
he
felt
a
little
reluctant
about
accepting
anything
which
had
not
been
approved
by
his
father
but
was
it
father
himself
who
taught
us
that
we
must
always
walk
in
the
ways
of
god
argued
karin
everything
seemed
to
be
so
bright
and
so
promising
ingmar
had
never
dreamed
that
it
would
be
so
delightful
to
get
back
among
people
once
more
there
was
only
one
thing
wanting
no
one
ever
spoke
of
the
schoolmaster
and
his
wife
or
of
gertrude
which
was
most
disquieting
to
him
he
had
not
seen
gertrude
for
a
whole
year
in
the
summer
he
had
never
been
without
news
of
her
for
then
hardly
a
day
went
by
that
some
one
did
not
speak
of
the
storms
he
thought
that
perhaps
this
silence
regarding
his
old
friends
was
accidental
when
one
feels
timid
about
asking
questions
and
when
no
one
voluntarily
speaks
of
that
which
one
longs
above
everything
to
hear
about
it
is
mighty
provoking
to
say
the
least
but
if
young
ingmar
seemed
to
be
happy
and
content
the
same
could
not
be
said
of
strong
ingmar
the
old
man
had
of
late
become
sullen
and
taciturn
and
difficult
to
get
on
with
i
believe
you
are
homesick
for
the
forest
ingmar
said
to
him
one
afternoon
as
they
sat
on
separate
logs
eating
their
sandwiches
god
knows
i
am
the
old
man
burst
forth
i
only
wish
i
had
never
come
back
at
all
why
what
gone
wrong
at
home
how
can
you
ask
you
must
know
as
well
as
i
that
hellgum
has
been
raising
the
deuce
around
here
ingmar
answered
that
on
the
contrary
he
had
heard
that
hellgum
had
become
a
big
man
yes
he
has
grown
so
big
and
strong
that
he
been
able
to
upset
the
whole
parish
strong
ingmar
sneered
it
seemed
strange
to
ingmar
that
the
old
man
never
evinced
a
particle
of
affection
for
any
of
his
own
kin
he
cared
for
nobody
and
for
nothing
save
the
ingmarssons
and
the
ingmar
farm
therefore
ingmar
felt
that
he
must
stand
up
for
the
i
think
his
doctrine
a
good
one
he
said
oh
you
do
do
you
snapped
the
old
man
and
he
gave
him
a
withering
look
do
you
think
big
ingmar
would
have
thought
so
ingmar
replied
that
his
father
would
have
upheld
any
one
who
worked
for
righteousness
it
your
belief
then
that
big
ingmar
would
have
approved
of
calling
all
persons
who
do
not
belong
to
hellgum
band
devils
and
and
that
he
would
have
refused
to
associate
with
his
old
friends
because
they
held
to
their
old
faith
i
hardly
think
that
such
people
as
hellgum
and
halvor
and
karin
would
behave
in
that
way
said
ingmar
just
you
try
to
oppose
them
once
and
you
soon
hear
what
they
think
of
you
ingmar
cut
off
a
big
corner
of
his
sandwich
and
stuffed
his
mouth
full
so
he
would
not
have
to
talk
it
irritated
him
to
see
strong
ingmar
in
such
bad
humour
heigho
hum
it
a
queer
world
sighed
the
old
man
here
you
sit
the
son
of
big
ingmar
with
nothing
to
say
while
my
anna
lisa
and
her
husband
are
living
on
the
fat
of
your
land
the
best
people
in
the
parish
bow
and
scrape
to
them
and
every
day
they
being
fêted
here
there
and
everywhere
ingmar
kept
on
munching
and
swallowing
there
was
nothing
he
could
say
strong
ingmar
however
went
at
him
again
yes
it
a
fine
doctrine
that
hellgum
is
spreading
that
why
half
the
parish
has
gone
over
to
him
no
one
has
ever
had
such
absolute
influence
over
the
people
not
even
strong
ingmar
himself
he
separates
children
from
their
parents
by
preaching
that
those
who
are
of
his
fold
must
not
live
among
sinners
hellgum
need
only
beckon
and
brother
leaves
brother
friend
leaves
friend
and
the
lover
deserts
his
betrothed
he
has
used
his
power
to
create
strife
and
dissension
in
every
household
of
course
big
ingmar
would
have
been
pleased
to
death
with
that
sort
of
thing
doubtless
he
would
have
backed
hellgum
up
in
all
this
i
can
just
picture
him
doing
it
ingmar
looked
up
and
down
he
wanted
to
get
away
he
knew
to
be
sure
that
the
old
man
had
been
drawing
heavily
on
his
imagination
but
all
the
same
this
talk
depressed
him
i
do
deny
that
hellgum
has
done
wonders
he
modified
the
way
in
which
he
manages
to
hold
his
people
together
and
the
way
he
can
get
those
who
formerly
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
to
live
on
friendly
terms
is
certainly
remarkable
and
look
how
he
takes
from
the
rich
to
give
to
the
poor
and
how
he
makes
each
person
protect
the
other
welfare
i
only
sorry
for
those
on
the
outside
who
are
called
children
of
the
devil
and
are
not
allowed
in
the
game
but
of
course
you
do
feel
that
way
ingmar
was
thoroughly
put
out
with
the
old
man
for
speaking
so
disparagingly
of
hellgum
there
used
to
be
such
peace
and
harmony
in
this
parish
the
old
man
rattled
on
but
that
all
past
and
gone
in
big
ingmar
time
we
lived
in
such
unity
that
we
had
the
name
of
being
the
friendliest
people
in
all
dalecarlia
now
there
are
angels
bucking
against
devils
and
sheep
against
goats
if
we
could
only
get
the
saws
going
thought
ingmar
i
have
to
hear
any
more
of
this
talk
it
wo
be
long
either
till
it
all
over
between
you
and
me
strong
ingmar
continued
for
if
you
join
hellgum
it
is
likely
that
they
will
let
you
associate
with
me
with
an
oath
ingmar
jumped
to
his
feet
if
you
go
on
talking
in
this
strain
it
may
turn
out
just
as
you
say
he
warned
you
may
as
well
understand
once
for
all
that
it
is
of
no
use
your
trying
to
turn
me
against
my
own
people
or
against
hellgum
who
is
the
grandest
man
i
know
that
silenced
the
old
man
in
a
little
while
he
left
his
work
saying
that
he
was
going
down
to
the
village
to
see
his
friend
corporal
felt
he
had
not
talked
with
a
sensible
person
for
a
long
time
he
declared
ingmar
was
glad
to
have
him
go
naturally
when
a
person
has
been
away
from
home
for
a
long
time
he
does
not
care
to
be
told
unpleasant
things
but
wants
every
one
around
him
to
be
bright
and
cheerful
at
five
the
next
morning
ingmar
got
down
to
the
mill
but
strong
ingmar
was
there
ahead
of
him
you
can
see
hellgum
the
old
man
began
he
and
anna
lisa
got
back
late
last
night
i
think
they
must
have
hurried
home
from
their
round
of
feasts
in
order
to
convert
you
so
you
at
it
again
scowled
ingmar
the
old
man
words
had
been
ringing
in
his
ears
all
night
and
he
could
not
help
wondering
who
was
in
the
right
but
now
he
did
not
want
to
listen
to
any
more
talk
against
his
relatives
the
old
man
held
his
peace
for
a
time
presently
he
began
to
chuckle
what
are
you
laughing
at
ingmar
demanded
his
hand
on
the
sluice
gate
ready
to
set
the
sawmill
going
i
was
just
thinking
of
the
schoolmaster
gertrude
what
about
her
they
said
down
at
the
village
yesterday
that
she
was
the
only
person
who
had
any
influence
over
hellgum
what
gertrude
got
to
do
with
hellgum
ingmar
meanwhile
had
not
opened
the
sluice
gate
for
with
the
saws
going
he
could
not
have
heard
a
word
the
old
man
eyed
him
questioningly
ingmar
smiled
a
little
you
always
manage
somehow
to
have
your
own
way
he
said
it
was
that
silly
goose
gunhild
councillor
daughter
who
she
no
silly
goose
ingmar
broke
in
oh
call
it
anything
you
like
but
she
happened
to
be
at
the
ingmar
farm
when
this
new
sect
was
founded
as
soon
as
she
got
home
she
informed
her
parents
that
she
had
accepted
the
only
true
faith
and
that
she
would
there
fore
have
to
leave
them
and
make
her
home
at
the
ingmar
farm
her
parents
asked
her
of
course
why
she
wanted
to
leave
home
so
she
be
able
to
lead
a
righteous
life
she
up
and
told
them
but
they
seemed
to
think
that
could
be
done
just
as
effectively
at
home
with
them
oh
no
that
be
possible
she
declared
unless
one
could
live
with
those
who
were
of
the
same
faith
her
father
then
asked
her
if
all
of
them
were
going
to
live
on
the
ingmar
farm
no
only
herself
the
others
had
true
christians
in
their
own
homes
now
clementsson
is
a
pretty
good
sort
as
you
know
and
both
he
and
his
wife
tried
to
reason
with
gunhild
in
all
kindness
but
she
stood
firm
at
last
her
father
became
so
exasperated
that
he
just
took
her
and
locked
her
up
in
her
room
telling
her
she
have
to
stay
there
till
this
crazy
fit
had
passed
i
thought
you
were
going
to
tell
me
about
gertrude
ingmar
reminded
him
i
get
round
to
her
by
and
by
if
you
only
have
patience
i
may
as
well
tell
you
at
once
that
early
the
next
morning
while
gertrude
and
mother
stina
were
sitting
in
the
kitchen
spinning
clementsson
called
to
see
them
when
they
saw
her
they
became
alarmed
she
who
was
usually
so
happy
and
light
of
heart
now
looked
as
if
she
been
crying
her
eyes
out
the
matter
what
has
happened
and
why
do
you
look
so
forlorn
they
asked
then
mother
clementsson
answered
that
when
one
has
lost
dearest
treasure
one
ca
very
well
look
cheerful
i
like
to
give
them
a
good
beating
said
the
old
man
who
asked
ingmar
why
hellgum
and
anna
lisa
they
marched
themselves
down
to
clementsson
in
the
night
and
kidnapped
gunhild
a
cry
of
amazement
escaped
ingmar
i
beginning
to
think
my
anna
lisa
is
married
to
a
brigand
said
the
old
man
in
the
middle
of
the
night
they
came
and
tapped
on
gunhild
window
and
asked
her
why
she
was
at
the
ingmar
farm
she
told
them
about
her
parents
having
locked
her
in
was
satan
who
made
do
it
said
hellgum
all
this
her
father
and
mother
overheard
did
they
really
yes
they
slept
in
the
next
room
and
the
door
between
was
partly
open
so
they
heard
all
that
hellgum
said
to
entice
their
daughter
but
they
could
have
sent
him
away
they
felt
that
gunhild
should
decide
for
herself
how
could
they
think
she
would
want
to
leave
them
after
all
they
had
done
for
her
they
lay
there
expecting
her
to
say
that
she
would
never
desert
her
old
parents
did
she
go
yes
hellgum
would
budge
till
the
girl
went
along
with
them
when
clementsson
and
his
wife
realized
that
she
could
resist
hellgum
they
let
her
go
some
folks
are
like
that
you
see
in
the
morning
the
mother
regretted
it
and
begged
the
father
to
drive
down
to
the
ingmar
farm
and
get
their
daughter
indeed
he
said
do
nothing
of
the
sort
and
what
more
i
never
want
to
set
eyes
on
her
again
unless
she
comes
home
of
her
own
accord
then
clementsson
hurried
down
to
the
school
to
see
if
gertrude
would
go
and
talk
to
gunhild
did
gertrude
go
yes
she
tried
to
reason
with
gunhild
but
gunhild
listen
i
have
not
seen
gunhild
at
our
house
said
ingmar
thoughtfully
no
for
now
she
is
back
with
her
parents
it
seems
that
when
gertrude
left
gunhild
she
met
hellgum
stands
the
one
who
is
to
blame
for
all
this
she
thought
and
then
she
went
straight
up
to
him
and
gave
him
a
tongue
lashing
she
would
have
minded
striking
him
oh
gertrude
can
talk
all
right
said
ingmar
approvingly
she
told
hellgum
that
he
had
behaved
like
a
heathen
warrior
and
not
as
a
christian
preacher
in
skulking
about
like
that
in
the
night
and
abducting
a
young
girl
what
did
hellgum
say
to
that
he
stood
quietly
listening
for
a
while
then
he
said
as
meek
as
you
please
that
she
was
right
he
had
acted
in
haste
and
in
the
afternoon
he
took
gunhild
back
to
her
parents
and
made
everything
right
again
ingmar
glanced
up
at
the
old
man
with
a
smile
gertrude
is
splendid
he
said
and
hellgum
is
a
fine
fellow
even
if
he
is
a
little
eccentric
so
that
the
way
you
take
it
eh
i
thought
you
would
wonder
why
hellgum
had
given
in
like
that
to
gertrude
ingmar
did
not
reply
to
this
after
a
moment
reflection
the
old
man
began
again
there
are
many
in
the
village
who
want
to
know
on
which
side
you
stand
i
do
see
as
it
matters
which
party
i
belong
to
let
me
remind
you
of
one
thing
said
the
old
man
in
this
parish
we
are
accustomed
to
having
somebody
that
we
can
look
up
to
as
a
leader
but
now
that
big
ingmar
is
gone
and
the
schoolmaster
has
lost
his
power
over
the
people
while
the
pastor
as
you
know
was
never
any
good
at
ruling
they
run
after
hellgum
and
they
going
to
follow
him
just
as
long
as
you
choose
to
remain
in
the
background
ingmar
hands
dropped
he
looked
quite
worn
out
but
i
do
know
who
is
in
the
right
he
protested
the
people
are
looking
to
you
for
deliverance
from
hellgum
you
may
be
sure
that
we
were
spared
a
lot
of
unpleasantness
by
being
away
from
home
all
winter
it
must
have
been
something
dreadful
in
the
beginning
before
people
had
got
used
to
this
converting
craze
and
to
being
called
devils
and
hellhounds
but
the
worst
of
all
was
when
the
converted
children
started
in
to
preach
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
even
the
children
preached
said
ingmar
doubtingly
oh
yes
the
old
man
returned
hellgum
told
them
that
they
should
serve
the
lord
instead
of
playing
so
they
started
in
to
convert
their
elders
they
lay
in
ambush
along
the
roadside
and
pounced
upon
innocent
with
such
ravings
as
these
you
going
to
begin
the
fight
against
the
devil
shall
you
continue
to
live
in
sin
young
ingmar
did
not
want
to
believe
what
strong
ingmar
was
recounting
old
man
felt
must
have
put
all
that
into
your
head
he
concluded
by
the
way
this
was
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
said
strong
ingmar
felt
is
done
for
too
when
i
think
that
all
this
mischief
has
been
hatched
on
the
ingmar
farm
i
feel
ashamed
to
look
people
in
the
face
have
they
wronged
felt
in
any
way
asked
ingmar
it
was
the
work
of
those
youngsters
drat
them
one
evening
when
they
had
nothing
else
to
do
they
took
it
into
their
heads
to
go
and
convert
felt
for
of
course
they
had
heard
that
he
was
a
great
sinner
but
in
the
old
days
all
the
children
were
as
afraid
of
felt
as
they
were
of
witches
and
trolls
ingmar
reminded
oh
these
youngsters
were
scared
too
but
they
must
have
had
their
hearts
set
upon
doing
something
very
heroic
so
one
evening
as
felt
sat
stirring
his
evening
porridge
they
stormed
his
cabin
when
they
opened
the
door
and
saw
the
old
corporal
with
his
bristling
moustaches
his
broken
nose
and
his
game
eye
sitting
before
the
fire
they
were
terribly
frightened
and
two
of
the
littlest
ones
ran
away
the
dozen
or
so
that
went
in
knelt
in
a
circle
around
the
old
man
and
began
to
sing
and
pray
and
did
he
drive
them
out
asked
ingmar
if
only
he
had
sighed
the
old
man
i
do
know
what
had
come
over
the
corporal
the
poor
wretch
must
have
been
sitting
there
brooding
over
the
loneliness
and
desolation
of
his
old
age
and
then
i
suppose
it
was
because
those
who
had
come
to
him
were
children
the
fact
that
children
had
always
been
afraid
of
him
must
have
been
a
source
of
grief
to
the
old
man
and
when
he
saw
all
those
baby
faces
with
their
upturned
eyes
filled
with
shining
tears
he
was
powerless
the
children
were
only
waiting
for
him
to
rush
at
them
and
strike
them
although
they
kept
right
on
singing
and
praying
they
were
ready
to
cut
and
run
the
instant
he
made
a
move
presently
a
pair
of
them
noticed
that
felt
face
was
beginning
to
twitch
he
go
for
us
they
thought
getting
up
to
flee
but
the
old
man
blinked
his
one
good
eye
and
a
tear
rolled
down
his
cheek
the
youngsters
shouted
and
now
as
i
already
told
you
it
all
up
with
felt
now
he
does
nothing
but
run
about
to
meetings
and
fasts
and
prays
and
fancies
he
hears
the
voice
of
god
i
do
see
anything
hurtful
in
all
that
said
ingmar
felt
was
killing
himself
with
drink
when
the
hellgumists
took
him
into
camp
well
you
got
so
many
friends
to
lose
that
a
little
thing
like
this
would
matter
to
you
no
doubt
you
would
have
liked
it
if
the
children
had
succeeded
in
converting
the
schoolmaster
i
ca
imagine
those
poor
little
kids
trying
to
tackle
storm
ingmar
was
dumfounded
what
strong
ingmar
had
said
about
the
parish
being
turned
upside
down
must
be
true
after
all
he
thought
but
they
did
though
strong
ingmar
replied
one
evening
as
storm
was
sitting
in
the
classroom
writing
a
score
of
them
came
in
and
began
preaching
to
him
and
what
did
storm
do
asked
ingmar
unable
to
keep
from
laughing
he
was
so
astounded
at
first
that
he
could
say
or
do
a
thing
but
as
luck
would
have
it
hellgum
had
arrived
a
few
moments
before
and
was
in
the
kitchen
talking
with
gertrude
was
hellgum
with
gertrude
yes
hellgum
and
gertrude
have
been
friends
ever
since
the
day
that
he
acted
upon
her
advice
in
the
little
matter
with
gunhild
when
gertrude
heard
the
racket
in
the
schoolroom
she
said
just
in
time
to
see
something
new
hellgum
it
would
seem
that
henceforth
the
children
are
to
instruct
the
schoolmaster
then
hellgum
laughed
for
he
comprehended
that
this
sort
of
thing
was
ludicrous
he
promptly
drove
the
children
out
and
abolished
the
nuisance
ingmar
noticed
that
the
old
man
was
eying
him
in
a
peculiar
way
it
was
as
if
a
hunter
were
looking
at
a
wounded
bear
and
wondering
whether
he
should
give
it
another
shot
i
do
know
what
you
expect
of
me
said
ingmar
what
could
i
expect
of
you
who
are
only
a
boy
why
you
have
a
penny
to
your
name
all
you
got
in
the
world
are
your
two
empty
hands
i
verily
believe
you
want
me
to
throttle
hellgum
they
said
down
at
the
village
that
this
would
soon
blow
over
if
you
could
only
induce
hellgum
to
leave
these
parts
whenever
a
new
religious
sect
springs
up
there
always
strife
and
dissension
said
ingmar
so
this
is
nothing
out
of
the
common
all
the
same
this
will
be
a
good
way
for
you
to
show
people
what
sort
of
stuff
you
made
of
the
old
man
persisted
ingmar
turned
away
and
set
the
saws
going
he
would
have
liked
above
everything
to
ask
how
gertrude
was
getting
along
and
whether
she
had
already
joined
the
hellgumists
but
he
was
too
proud
to
betray
his
fears
at
eight
he
went
home
to
his
breakfast
as
usual
the
table
was
heaped
with
tempting
dishes
and
both
halvor
and
karin
were
especially
nice
to
him
seeing
them
so
kind
and
gentle
he
could
not
believe
a
word
of
strong
ingmar
chatter
he
felt
light
of
heart
once
more
and
positive
that
the
old
man
had
exaggerated
in
a
little
while
his
anxiety
about
gertrude
returned
with
a
force
so
overwhelming
that
it
took
away
his
appetite
and
he
could
not
touch
his
food
suddenly
he
turned
to
karin
and
said
abruptly
have
you
seen
anything
of
the
storms
lately
no
replied
karin
stiffly
i
do
care
to
associate
with
such
ungodly
people
here
was
an
answer
that
set
ingmar
thinking
he
wondered
whether
he
had
better
speak
or
be
silent
if
he
were
to
speak
it
might
end
in
a
break
with
his
family
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
want
them
to
think
that
he
up
held
them
in
matters
that
were
altogether
wrong
i
have
never
seen
any
signs
of
ungodliness
about
the
folks
he
retorted
and
yet
i
have
lived
with
them
for
four
years
the
very
thought
that
had
occurred
to
ingmar
the
moment
before
now
came
to
karin
she
too
wondered
whether
she
should
or
should
not
speak
but
she
felt
that
she
would
have
to
hold
to
the
truth
even
if
it
hurt
ingmar
therefore
she
said
that
if
people
would
not
hearken
to
the
voice
of
god
one
could
not
help
but
think
them
ungodly
then
halvor
joined
in
the
question
of
the
children
is
a
vital
one
he
said
they
should
be
given
the
right
kind
of
training
storm
has
trained
the
entire
parish
and
you
too
halvor
ingmar
reminded
him
but
he
has
not
taught
us
how
to
live
rightly
said
karin
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
always
tried
to
do
that
karin
let
me
tell
you
how
it
was
to
live
by
the
old
teaching
it
was
like
trying
to
walk
upon
a
round
beam
one
minute
you
were
up
the
next
you
were
down
but
when
i
let
my
take
me
by
the
hand
and
support
me
i
can
tread
the
straight
and
narrow
path
of
righteousness
without
stumbling
i
dare
say
ingmar
smiled
but
that
too
easy
even
so
it
quite
difficult
enough
but
no
longer
impossible
but
what
about
the
storms
those
who
belong
with
us
took
their
children
out
of
the
school
you
see
we
did
want
the
children
to
absorb
any
of
the
old
teaching
what
did
the
schoolmaster
say
to
that
he
said
it
was
against
the
law
to
take
children
away
from
school
and
promptly
sent
a
constable
over
to
israel
tomasson
and
krister
larsson
to
fetch
their
children
and
now
you
are
not
on
friendly
terms
with
the
storms
we
simply
keep
to
ourselves
you
seem
to
be
at
odds
with
every
one
we
only
keep
away
from
those
who
would
tempt
us
to
sin
as
the
three
went
on
talking
they
lowered
their
voices
they
were
all
very
fearful
of
every
word
they
let
drop
for
they
felt
that
the
conversation
had
taken
a
painful
turn
but
i
can
give
you
greetings
from
gertrude
said
karin
trying
to
assume
a
more
cheerful
tone
hellgum
had
many
talks
with
her
last
winter
he
says
that
she
expects
to
join
us
this
evening
ingmar
lips
began
to
quiver
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
going
about
blindfolded
all
day
expecting
to
be
shot
and
now
the
shot
had
come
the
bullet
had
pierced
his
heart
so
she
wants
to
become
one
of
you
he
murmured
faintly
many
things
can
happen
here
while
one
is
up
in
the
dark
forest
ingmar
seemed
to
think
that
all
this
time
hellgum
had
been
ingratiating
himself
with
gertrude
and
had
laid
snares
to
catch
her
but
what
to
become
of
me
he
asked
suddenly
and
there
was
a
strange
helpless
appeal
in
his
voice
you
must
embrace
our
faith
said
halvor
decisively
hellgum
is
back
now
and
if
he
talks
to
you
once
you
soon
become
converted
but
maybe
i
do
care
to
be
converted
halvor
and
karin
stared
at
ingmar
in
speechless
amazement
maybe
i
do
want
any
faith
but
my
father
do
say
anything
until
you
have
had
a
talk
with
hellgum
begged
karin
but
if
i
do
join
you
i
suppose
you
wo
want
me
to
remain
under
your
roof
said
ingmar
rising
as
they
did
not
reply
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
at
once
he
had
been
cut
off
from
everything
then
he
pulled
himself
together
and
looked
more
determined
now
i
want
to
know
what
you
going
to
do
about
the
sawmill
he
demanded
thinking
it
was
best
to
have
this
matter
settled
once
for
all
halvor
and
karin
exchanged
glances
both
were
afraid
of
committing
themselves
you
know
ingmar
that
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
who
is
more
dear
to
us
than
you
said
halvor
yes
yes
but
what
about
the
sawmill
ingmar
insisted
the
principal
thing
is
to
get
all
your
timber
sawed
at
halvor
evasive
reply
ingmar
drew
his
own
conclusions
maybe
hellgum
wants
to
run
the
sawmill
too
karin
and
halvor
were
perplexed
at
ingmar
show
of
temper
since
telling
him
that
about
gertrude
they
could
not
seem
to
get
anywhere
near
him
let
hellgum
talk
to
you
pleaded
karin
oh
i
let
him
talk
to
me
said
ingmar
but
first
i
like
to
know
just
where
i
stand
surely
ingmar
you
must
know
that
we
wish
you
well
but
hellgum
is
to
run
the
sawmill
we
must
find
some
suitable
employment
for
hellgum
so
that
he
may
remain
in
his
own
country
we
have
been
thinking
that
possibly
you
and
he
might
become
business
partners
provided
you
accept
the
only
true
faith
hellgum
is
a
good
worker
this
from
halvor
since
when
have
you
been
afraid
to
speak
plainly
halvor
said
ingmar
all
i
want
to
know
is
whether
hellgum
is
to
have
the
sawmill
he
is
to
have
it
if
you
resist
god
halvor
declared
i
obliged
to
you
for
telling
me
what
a
good
stroke
of
business
it
would
be
for
me
to
adopt
your
faith
you
know
well
enough
it
was
meant
in
that
way
said
karin
reprovingly
i
understand
quite
well
what
you
mean
returned
ingmar
i
to
lose
gertrude
and
the
sawmill
and
the
old
home
unless
i
go
over
to
the
hellgumists
then
ingmar
turned
suddenly
and
walked
out
of
the
house
once
outside
the
thought
came
to
him
that
he
might
as
well
end
this
suspense
and
find
out
at
once
where
he
stood
with
gertrude
so
he
went
straight
down
to
the
when
ingmar
opened
the
gate
a
mild
spring
rain
was
falling
in
the
beautiful
garden
all
things
had
started
sprouting
and
budding
the
ground
was
turning
green
so
rapidly
that
one
could
almost
see
the
grass
growing
gertrude
was
standing
on
the
steps
watching
the
rain
and
two
large
bushes
thick
with
newly
sprung
leaves
spread
their
branches
over
her
ingmar
paused
a
moment
astonished
at
finding
everything
down
here
so
lovely
and
peaceful
he
was
already
beginning
to
feel
less
disquieted
gertrude
had
not
yet
seen
him
he
closed
the
gate
very
gently
then
went
toward
her
when
he
was
quite
close
he
stopped
and
gazed
at
her
in
rapt
wonder
when
he
had
last
seen
her
she
was
hardly
more
than
a
child
but
in
one
short
year
she
had
developed
into
a
dignified
and
beautiful
young
lady
she
was
now
tall
and
slender
and
quite
grown
up
her
head
was
finely
poised
on
a
graceful
neck
her
skin
was
soft
and
fair
shading
into
a
fresh
pink
about
the
cheeks
her
eyes
were
deep
and
thoughtful
and
her
mouth
around
which
mischief
and
merriment
had
once
played
now
expressed
seriousness
and
wistful
longing
on
seeing
gertrude
so
changed
a
sense
of
supreme
happiness
came
to
ingmar
a
peaceful
stillness
pervaded
his
whole
being
it
was
as
though
he
were
in
the
presence
of
something
great
and
holy
it
was
all
so
beautiful
that
he
wanted
to
go
down
on
his
knees
and
thank
god
but
when
gertrude
saw
ingmar
she
suddenly
stiffened
her
eyebrows
contracted
and
between
her
eyes
there
appeared
the
shadow
of
a
wrinkle
he
saw
at
once
that
she
did
not
like
his
being
there
and
it
cut
him
to
the
quick
they
want
to
take
her
from
me
he
thought
they
have
already
taken
her
from
me
the
feeling
of
sabbath
peace
vanished
and
the
old
fear
and
anxiety
returned
waving
all
ceremony
he
asked
gertrude
if
it
was
true
that
she
intended
to
join
hellgum
and
his
followers
she
answered
that
it
was
then
ingmar
asked
her
if
she
had
considered
that
the
hellgumists
would
not
allow
her
to
associate
with
persons
who
did
not
think
as
they
did
gertrude
quietly
answered
that
she
had
carefully
considered
this
matter
have
you
the
consent
of
your
father
and
mother
asked
ingmar
no
she
replied
they
know
nothing
as
yet
but
gertrude
hush
ingmar
i
must
do
this
to
find
peace
god
compels
me
no
he
cried
not
god
but
gertrude
suddenly
turned
toward
him
then
ingmar
told
her
that
he
would
never
join
the
hellgumists
if
you
go
over
to
them
that
will
part
us
for
ever
gertrude
looked
at
him
as
much
as
to
say
that
she
did
not
see
how
this
could
affect
her
do
do
it
gertrude
he
implored
you
must
think
that
i
acting
heedlessly
for
i
have
given
this
matter
very
serious
thought
then
think
it
over
once
more
before
you
act
gertrude
turned
from
him
impatiently
you
should
also
think
it
over
for
hellgum
sake
said
ingmar
with
rising
anger
seizing
her
by
the
arm
she
shook
off
his
hand
are
you
out
of
your
senses
ingmar
she
gasped
yes
he
answered
these
doings
of
hellgum
are
driving
me
mad
they
must
be
stopped
what
must
be
stopped
you
find
out
before
long
gertrude
shrugged
her
shoulders
gertrude
he
said
in
a
choking
voice
and
remember
what
i
tell
you
you
will
never
join
the
hellgumists
what
do
you
intend
to
do
ingmar
asked
the
girl
for
she
was
beginning
to
feel
uneasy
gertrude
and
think
of
what
i
have
said
ingmar
shouted
back
for
by
that
time
he
was
halfway
down
the
gravel
walk
then
he
went
on
his
way
if
i
were
only
as
wise
as
my
father
he
mused
but
what
can
i
do
i
about
to
lose
all
that
is
dearest
to
me
and
i
see
no
way
of
preventing
it
there
was
one
thing
however
of
which
ingmar
was
certain
if
all
this
misery
was
to
be
forced
upon
him
hellgum
should
not
escape
with
his
skin
he
went
down
to
strong
ingmar
but
in
the
hope
of
meeting
the
preacher
when
he
got
to
the
door
he
caught
the
sound
of
loud
and
angry
voices
there
seemed
to
be
a
number
of
visitors
inside
so
he
turned
back
at
once
as
he
walked
away
he
heard
a
man
say
in
angry
tones
we
are
three
brothers
who
have
come
a
long
way
to
call
you
to
account
john
hellgum
for
what
has
befallen
our
younger
brother
two
years
ago
he
went
over
to
america
where
he
joined
your
community
the
other
day
we
received
a
letter
telling
us
that
he
had
gone
out
of
his
mind
brooding
over
your
teaching
then
ingmar
hurried
away
apparently
there
were
others
besides
himself
who
had
cause
for
complaint
against
hellgum
and
they
were
all
of
them
equally
helpless
he
went
down
to
the
sawmill
which
had
already
been
set
going
by
strong
ingmar
above
the
buzzing
noise
of
the
saws
and
the
roar
of
the
rapids
he
heard
a
shriek
but
he
paid
no
special
heed
to
it
he
had
no
thought
for
anything
save
his
strong
hatred
of
hellgum
he
was
going
over
in
his
mind
all
that
this
man
had
robbed
him
of
gertrude
and
karin
his
home
and
his
business
again
he
seemed
to
hear
a
cry
it
occurred
to
him
that
possibly
a
quarrel
had
arisen
between
hellgum
and
the
strangers
there
would
be
no
harm
done
if
they
were
to
beat
the
life
out
of
him
he
thought
then
he
heard
a
loud
shout
for
help
ingmar
dropped
his
work
and
went
rushing
up
the
hill
the
nearer
he
approached
the
hut
the
plainer
he
heard
hellgum
cries
of
distress
and
when
he
finally
reached
the
cabin
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
earth
around
it
shook
from
the
scuffling
and
struggling
inside
he
cautiously
opened
the
door
and
tiptoed
in
over
against
the
wall
stood
hellgum
defending
himself
with
an
axe
the
three
strangers
all
of
them
big
powerful
men
were
attacking
him
with
clubs
they
carried
no
guns
so
it
was
evident
that
they
had
come
simply
to
give
hellgum
a
sound
thrashing
but
because
he
had
put
up
a
good
fight
they
were
so
enraged
that
they
went
at
him
with
intent
to
kill
they
hardly
noticed
ingmar
they
regarded
him
as
nothing
but
a
lank
gawk
of
a
boy
who
had
just
happened
in
for
a
moment
ingmar
stood
quietly
looking
on
to
him
it
was
like
a
dream
wherein
the
thing
one
desires
most
suddenly
appears
without
one
knowing
whence
or
how
it
came
about
now
and
again
hellgum
cried
for
help
surely
you
ca
think
i
such
a
fool
as
to
help
you
ingmar
said
in
his
mind
suddenly
one
of
the
men
dealt
hellgum
a
terrific
blow
on
the
head
that
made
him
let
go
his
hold
on
the
axe
and
fall
to
the
floor
then
the
others
threw
down
their
clubs
drew
their
knives
and
cast
themselves
upon
him
instantly
a
thought
flashed
across
mind
there
was
an
old
saying
about
the
folk
of
his
family
to
the
effect
that
every
one
of
them
was
destined
at
some
time
or
other
during
his
lifetime
to
commit
a
dastardly
and
wrong
deed
was
it
his
turn
now
he
wondered
all
at
once
one
of
the
assailants
felt
himself
in
the
grip
of
a
pair
of
strong
arms
that
lifted
him
off
his
feet
and
threw
him
bodily
out
of
the
house
the
second
one
had
hardly
time
to
think
of
rising
before
the
same
thing
happened
to
him
and
the
third
who
had
managed
to
scramble
to
his
feet
got
a
blow
that
sent
him
headlong
after
the
others
after
ingmar
had
thrown
them
all
out
he
went
and
stood
in
the
doorway
do
you
want
to
come
back
he
challenged
laughingly
he
would
not
have
minded
their
attacking
him
testing
his
strength
was
good
sport
the
three
brothers
seemed
quite
ready
to
renew
the
fight
when
one
of
them
shouted
that
they
had
better
take
to
their
heels
he
had
seen
a
figure
coming
along
the
path
behind
the
elms
they
were
furiously
disappointed
at
not
having
finished
hellgum
and
as
they
turned
to
go
one
of
them
ran
back
pounced
upon
ingmar
and
stabbed
him
in
the
neck
that
for
meddling
with
our
affair
he
shouted
ingmar
sank
down
and
the
man
ran
off
with
a
taunting
laugh
a
few
minutes
later
karin
came
along
and
found
ingmar
sitting
on
the
doorstep
with
a
wound
in
his
neck
and
inside
she
discovered
hellgum
who
by
that
time
had
got
to
his
feet
again
and
was
now
leaning
against
the
wall
axe
in
hand
and
his
face
covered
with
blood
karin
had
not
seen
the
fleeing
men
she
supposed
that
ingmar
was
the
one
who
had
attacked
hellgum
and
wounded
him
she
was
so
horrified
that
her
knees
shook
no
no
she
thought
it
ca
be
possible
that
any
one
in
our
family
is
a
murderer
then
she
recalled
the
story
of
her
mother
that
accounts
for
it
she
muttered
and
hurried
past
ingmar
over
to
hellgum
ingmar
first
cried
hellgum
the
murderer
should
not
be
helped
before
his
victim
said
karin
ingmar
first
ingmar
first
hellgum
kept
shouting
he
was
so
excited
that
he
raised
his
axe
against
her
he
has
fought
the
murderers
and
saved
my
life
he
said
when
karin
finally
understood
and
turned
to
help
ingmar
he
was
gone
she
saw
him
stagger
across
the
yard
and
ran
after
him
calling
ingmar
ingmar
ingmar
went
on
without
even
turning
his
head
but
she
soon
caught
up
with
him
placing
her
hand
on
his
arm
she
said
stop
ingmar
and
let
me
bind
up
your
wound
he
shook
off
her
hand
and
went
ahead
like
a
blind
man
following
neither
road
nor
bypath
the
blood
from
his
open
wound
trickled
down
underneath
his
clothes
into
one
of
his
shoes
with
every
step
that
he
made
blood
was
pressed
out
of
the
shoe
leaving
a
red
track
on
the
ground
karin
followed
him
wringing
her
hands
stop
ingmar
stop
she
implored
where
are
you
going
stop
i
say
ingmar
wandered
on
straight
into
the
wood
where
there
was
no
one
to
succor
him
karin
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
shoe
which
was
oozing
blood
every
second
the
footprints
were
becoming
redder
and
redder
he
going
into
the
forest
to
lie
down
and
bleed
to
death
thought
karin
god
bless
you
ingmar
for
helping
hellgum
she
said
gently
it
took
a
man
courage
to
do
that
and
a
strength
too
ingmar
tramped
straight
ahead
paying
no
heed
whatever
to
his
sister
then
karin
ran
past
him
and
planted
herself
in
his
way
he
stepped
aside
without
so
much
as
glancing
at
her
go
and
help
hellgum
he
muttered
let
me
explain
ingmar
halvor
and
i
were
very
sorry
for
what
we
said
to
you
this
morning
and
i
was
just
on
my
way
to
hellgum
to
let
him
know
that
whichever
way
it
turned
out
you
were
to
keep
the
sawmill
now
you
can
give
it
to
hellgum
was
ingmar
answer
he
walked
on
stumbling
over
stones
and
tree
stumps
karin
kept
close
behind
trying
her
best
to
conciliate
him
you
forgive
me
for
my
mistake
of
a
moment
in
thinking
you
had
fought
with
hellgum
i
could
hardly
have
thought
differently
you
were
very
ready
to
believe
your
own
brother
a
murderer
ingmar
retorted
without
giving
her
a
look
he
still
walked
on
when
the
grass
blades
he
had
trampled
down
came
up
again
blood
dripped
from
them
it
was
only
after
karin
had
noticed
the
peculiar
way
in
which
ingmar
had
spoken
hellgum
name
that
she
began
to
realize
how
he
hated
the
preacher
at
the
same
time
she
saw
what
a
big
thing
he
had
done
every
one
will
be
singing
your
praises
for
what
you
did
ingmar
it
will
be
known
far
and
wide
she
said
you
do
want
to
die
and
miss
all
the
honours
do
you
ingmar
laughed
scornfully
then
he
turned
toward
her
a
face
that
was
pale
and
haggard
why
do
you
go
home
karin
he
said
i
know
well
enough
whom
you
would
prefer
to
help
his
steps
became
more
and
more
uncertain
and
now
where
he
had
walked
there
was
a
continuous
streak
of
blood
on
the
ground
karin
was
about
beside
herself
at
the
sight
of
all
this
blood
the
great
love
which
she
had
always
felt
or
ingmar
kindled
with
new
ardour
now
she
was
proud
of
her
brother
and
thought
him
a
stout
branch
of
the
good
old
family
tree
oh
ingmar
she
cried
you
have
to
answer
before
god
and
your
fellowmen
if
you
go
on
spilling
your
life
blood
in
this
way
you
know
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
to
make
you
want
to
live
you
have
only
to
speak
ingmar
halted
and
put
his
arm
around
the
stem
of
a
tree
to
hold
himself
up
then
with
a
cynical
laugh
he
said
perhaps
send
hellgum
back
to
america
karin
stood
looking
down
at
the
pool
of
blood
that
was
forming
around
ingmar
left
foot
pondering
over
the
thing
her
brother
wanted
her
to
do
could
it
be
that
he
expected
her
to
leave
the
beautiful
garden
of
paradise
where
she
had
lived
all
winter
and
go
back
to
the
wretched
world
of
sin
she
had
come
out
of
ingmar
turned
round
squarely
his
face
was
waxen
the
skin
across
his
temples
was
tightly
drawn
and
his
nose
was
like
that
of
a
dead
person
but
his
under
lip
protruded
with
a
determination
that
he
had
never
before
shown
and
the
set
look
about
the
mouth
was
sharply
defined
it
was
not
likely
that
he
would
modify
his
demand
i
do
think
that
hellgum
and
i
can
live
in
the
same
parish
he
said
but
it
plain
enough
that
i
must
make
way
for
him
no
cried
karin
quickly
if
you
will
only
let
me
care
for
you
so
that
your
life
may
be
spared
to
us
i
promise
you
that
i
will
see
that
hellgum
goes
away
god
will
surely
find
us
another
shepherd
thought
karin
but
for
the
time
being
it
seems
best
to
let
ingmar
have
his
way
after
she
had
staunched
the
wound
she
helped
ingmar
home
and
put
him
to
bed
he
was
not
badly
wounded
all
he
needed
was
to
rest
quietly
for
a
few
days
he
lay
abed
in
a
room
upstairs
and
karin
tended
him
and
watched
over
him
like
a
baby
the
first
day
ingmar
was
delirious
and
lived
over
all
that
had
happened
to
him
in
the
morning
karin
soon
discovered
that
hellgum
and
the
sawmill
were
not
the
only
things
that
had
caused
him
anxiety
by
evening
his
mind
was
clear
and
tranquil
then
karin
said
to
him
there
is
some
one
who
wishes
to
speak
to
you
ingmar
replied
that
he
felt
too
tired
to
talk
to
any
one
but
i
think
this
will
do
you
good
directly
afterward
gertrude
came
into
the
room
she
looked
quite
solemn
and
troubled
ingmar
had
been
fond
of
gertrude
even
in
the
old
days
when
she
was
full
of
fun
and
provoking
but
at
that
time
something
within
him
had
always
fought
against
his
love
but
now
gertrude
had
passed
through
a
trying
year
of
longing
and
unrest
which
had
wrought
such
a
wonderful
change
in
her
that
ingmar
felt
an
uncontrollable
longing
to
win
her
when
gertrude
came
over
to
the
bed
ingmar
put
his
hand
up
to
his
eyes
do
you
want
to
see
me
she
asked
ingmar
shook
his
head
he
was
like
a
wilful
child
i
only
want
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
said
gertrude
i
suppose
you
come
to
tell
me
that
you
have
joined
the
hellgumists
then
gertrude
knelt
down
beside
the
bed
and
lifted
his
hand
from
his
eyes
there
is
something
which
you
do
know
ingmar
she
whispered
he
looked
inquiringly
at
her
but
did
not
speak
gertrude
blushed
and
hesitated
finally
she
said
last
year
just
as
you
were
leaving
us
i
had
begun
to
care
for
you
in
the
right
way
ingmar
coloured
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
a
look
of
joy
came
into
his
eyes
but
immediately
he
became
grave
and
distrustful
again
i
have
missed
you
so
ingmar
she
murmured
he
smiled
doubtingly
but
patted
her
hand
a
little
as
thanks
for
her
wanting
to
be
kind
to
him
and
you
never
once
came
back
to
see
me
she
said
reproachfully
it
was
as
if
i
no
longer
existed
for
you
i
did
want
to
see
you
again
until
i
was
a
man
and
could
propose
to
you
said
ingmar
as
if
this
were
a
matter
but
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
me
gertrude
eyes
filled
up
you
do
know
what
a
terrible
year
it
has
been
hellgum
has
been
very
kind
and
has
tried
to
comfort
me
he
said
my
heart
would
be
at
rest
if
i
would
give
it
wholly
to
god
ingmar
now
looked
at
her
with
a
newborn
hope
in
his
gaze
i
was
so
frightened
when
you
came
this
morning
she
confessed
i
felt
that
i
could
resist
you
and
that
the
old
struggle
would
begin
anew
ingmar
face
was
beaming
but
this
evening
when
i
heard
about
your
having
helped
the
one
man
whom
you
hated
i
could
hold
out
any
longer
gertrude
grew
scarlet
i
felt
somehow
that
i
had
not
the
strength
to
do
a
thing
that
would
part
me
from
you
then
she
bowed
her
head
over
hand
and
kissed
it
and
it
seemed
to
ingmar
as
if
great
bells
were
ringing
in
a
holy
day
within
reigned
sabbath
peace
and
stillness
while
love
honey
sweet
rested
upon
his
lips
filling
his
whole
being
with
a
blissful
solace
book
three
loss
of
one
misty
night
in
the
summer
of
about
two
years
before
the
schoolmaster
mission
house
was
built
and
hellgum
return
from
america
the
great
french
liner
was
steaming
across
the
atlantic
from
new
york
and
bound
for
havre
it
was
about
four
in
the
morning
and
all
the
passengers
as
well
as
most
of
the
crew
were
asleep
in
their
berths
the
big
decks
were
entirely
empty
of
people
just
then
at
the
break
of
day
an
old
french
sailor
lay
twisting
and
turning
in
his
hammock
unable
to
rest
there
was
quite
a
sea
on
and
the
ship
timbers
creaked
incessantly
but
it
was
certainly
not
this
that
kept
him
from
falling
asleep
he
and
his
mates
occupied
a
large
but
exceedingly
low
compartment
between
decks
it
was
lighted
by
a
couple
of
lanterns
so
that
he
could
see
the
gray
hammocks
which
hung
in
close
rows
slowly
swinging
to
and
fro
with
their
slumbering
occupants
now
and
again
a
strong
gust
of
wind
swept
in
through
one
of
the
hatches
which
was
so
searchingly
cold
and
damp
that
it
brought
to
his
mind
eye
a
vivid
picture
of
the
vast
sea
around
him
rolling
its
grayish
green
waves
beneath
its
veil
of
mists
there
nothing
like
the
sea
thought
the
old
sailor
as
he
lay
there
musing
all
at
once
everything
became
strangely
still
around
him
he
heard
neither
the
churning
of
the
propeller
nor
the
rattling
of
the
rudder
chains
nor
the
lapping
of
the
waves
nor
the
whistling
of
the
wind
nor
any
other
sound
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
ship
had
suddenly
gone
to
the
bottom
and
that
he
and
his
mates
would
never
be
shrouded
or
laid
in
their
coffins
but
must
remain
hanging
in
their
gray
hammocks
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
till
the
day
of
judgment
before
he
had
always
dreaded
the
thought
that
his
end
might
be
a
watery
grave
but
now
the
idea
of
it
was
pleasing
to
him
he
was
glad
it
was
the
moving
and
transparent
water
that
covered
him
and
not
the
heavy
black
suffocating
mould
of
the
churchyard
nothing
like
the
sea
he
thought
again
then
he
fell
to
thinking
of
something
that
made
him
uneasy
he
wondered
whether
his
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
without
having
received
extreme
unction
would
not
be
bad
for
his
soul
he
began
to
fear
that
now
his
soul
would
never
be
able
to
find
its
way
up
to
heaven
at
that
moment
his
eye
caught
a
faint
glimmer
of
light
coming
from
the
forecastle
he
raised
himself
and
leaned
over
the
side
of
the
hammock
to
see
what
it
was
presently
he
saw
two
persons
coming
each
of
whom
was
carrying
a
lighted
candle
he
bent
still
farther
forward
so
as
to
see
who
they
were
the
hammocks
were
hung
so
close
together
and
so
near
to
the
floor
that
any
one
wanting
to
pass
through
the
room
without
pushing
or
knocking
against
those
who
were
sleeping
there
would
have
to
crawl
on
hands
and
knees
the
old
seaman
wondered
who
the
persons
could
be
that
were
able
to
pass
in
this
crowded
place
he
soon
discovered
that
they
were
two
diminutive
acolytes
in
surplice
and
cassock
each
bearing
a
lighted
candle
the
sailor
was
not
at
all
surprised
it
seemed
only
natural
that
such
little
folk
should
be
able
to
walk
with
burning
candles
under
hammocks
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
priest
with
them
he
said
immediately
he
heard
the
tinkling
sound
of
a
little
bell
and
saw
some
one
following
them
however
it
was
no
priest
but
an
old
woman
who
was
not
much
bigger
than
the
boys
the
old
woman
looked
familiar
to
him
it
must
be
mother
he
thought
i
never
seen
any
one
as
tiny
as
mother
and
surely
no
one
but
mother
could
be
coming
along
so
softly
and
quietly
without
waking
people
he
noticed
that
his
mother
wore
over
her
black
dress
a
long
white
linen
surplice
edged
with
a
wide
border
of
lace
such
as
is
worn
by
priests
in
her
hand
she
held
the
large
missal
with
the
gold
cross
which
he
had
seen
hundreds
of
times
lying
on
the
altar
in
the
church
at
home
the
little
acolytes
now
placed
their
candles
at
the
side
of
his
hammock
and
knelt
down
each
swinging
a
censer
the
old
sailor
caught
the
sweet
odour
of
burning
incense
saw
blue
clouds
ascend
and
heard
the
rhythmical
click
click
of
the
censer
chains
in
the
meantime
his
mother
had
opened
the
big
book
and
was
reading
the
prayers
for
the
dead
now
it
seemed
good
to
him
to
be
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
much
better
than
being
in
the
churchyard
he
stretched
himself
in
the
hammock
and
for
a
long
time
he
could
hear
his
mother
voice
mumbling
latin
words
the
smoke
of
the
incense
curled
round
him
as
he
listened
to
the
even
click
click
of
the
moving
censers
then
it
all
ceased
the
acolytes
took
up
their
candles
and
walked
away
followed
by
his
mother
who
suddenly
closed
the
book
with
a
bang
he
saw
all
three
disappear
beneath
the
gray
hammocks
the
instant
they
had
gone
the
silence
was
at
an
end
he
heard
the
breathing
of
his
comrades
the
timbers
creaked
the
wind
whistled
and
the
waves
against
the
ship
then
he
knew
that
he
was
still
among
the
living
and
on
top
of
the
sea
jesu
maria
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
the
things
i
have
seen
this
night
he
asked
himself
ten
minutes
later
was
struck
amidships
it
was
as
if
the
steamer
had
been
cut
in
two
this
was
what
i
expected
thought
the
old
seaman
during
the
terrible
confusion
that
ensued
while
the
other
sailors
only
half
awake
rolled
out
of
their
hammocks
he
carefully
dressed
himself
in
his
best
clothes
he
had
had
a
foretaste
of
death
which
was
sweet
and
mild
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
sea
had
already
claimed
him
as
its
own
a
little
cabin
boy
lay
sleeping
in
the
deckhouse
near
the
dining
salon
when
the
collision
occurred
startled
by
the
shock
he
sat
up
in
his
bunk
half
dazed
and
wondering
what
had
happened
just
over
his
head
there
was
a
small
porthole
through
which
he
peered
all
he
could
see
was
fog
and
some
shadowy
gray
object
which
had
as
it
were
sprung
from
the
fog
he
seemed
to
see
monstrous
gray
wings
a
mammoth
bird
must
have
swooped
down
on
the
ship
he
thought
the
steamer
rolled
and
heeled
as
the
huge
monster
went
at
it
with
claws
and
beak
and
flapping
wings
the
little
cabin
boy
thought
he
would
die
from
fright
in
a
second
he
was
wide
awake
then
he
discovered
that
a
large
sailing
vessel
had
collided
with
the
steamer
he
saw
great
sails
and
a
strange
deck
where
men
in
oilskin
coats
were
rushing
about
in
mad
terror
the
wind
freshened
and
the
sails
became
as
taut
as
drums
the
masts
bulged
while
the
yards
snapped
with
a
succession
of
reports
that
sounded
like
pistol
shots
a
great
which
in
the
dense
fog
had
sailed
straight
into
had
somehow
got
her
bowsprit
wedged
into
the
side
of
the
liner
and
could
not
free
herself
the
passenger
steamer
listed
considerably
but
its
propellers
went
right
on
working
so
that
now
both
ships
moved
along
together
lord
god
exclaimed
the
cabin
boy
as
he
rushed
out
on
deck
that
poor
boat
has
run
into
us
and
now
it
will
surely
sink
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
the
steamer
could
be
imperilled
big
and
fine
as
she
was
the
officers
came
hurrying
up
but
when
they
saw
it
was
only
a
sailing
vessel
that
had
collided
with
their
ship
they
felt
quite
safe
and
with
the
utmost
confidence
took
the
necessary
steps
for
getting
the
boats
clear
of
each
other
the
little
cabin
boy
stood
on
the
deck
barelegged
his
shirt
fluttering
in
the
wind
and
beckoned
to
the
unhappy
men
on
the
sailing
vessel
to
come
over
to
the
steamer
and
save
themselves
at
first
no
one
seemed
to
take
any
notice
of
him
but
presently
a
big
man
with
a
red
beard
began
motioning
to
him
come
over
here
boy
the
man
shouted
running
to
the
side
of
the
vessel
the
steamer
is
sinking
the
little
boy
had
not
the
faintest
notion
of
going
over
to
the
sailing
vessel
he
shouted
as
loud
as
he
could
that
the
people
on
the
doomed
boat
should
come
over
to
and
save
their
lives
while
the
other
men
on
the
were
working
with
poles
and
boat
hooks
to
free
their
vessel
from
the
steamer
the
man
with
the
red
beard
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
little
cabin
boy
for
whom
he
had
evidently
conceived
an
extraordinary
pity
he
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
called
come
over
here
come
over
here
the
little
lad
looked
forlorn
and
cold
standing
on
the
deck
in
his
thin
shirt
he
stamped
his
foot
and
shook
his
fist
at
the
men
on
the
other
boat
because
they
would
not
mind
him
and
board
the
steamer
a
huge
greyhound
like
with
six
hundred
passengers
and
a
crew
of
two
hundred
men
could
possibly
go
down
he
reasoned
and
of
course
he
could
see
that
both
the
captain
and
the
sailors
were
just
as
calm
as
he
was
of
a
sudden
the
man
with
the
red
beard
seized
a
boat
hook
thrust
it
out
toward
the
boy
got
him
by
the
shirt
and
tried
to
pull
him
on
to
the
other
ship
the
boy
was
dragged
as
far
as
the
railing
but
there
he
managed
to
free
himself
of
the
hook
he
was
not
going
to
let
himself
be
dragged
over
to
a
strange
vessel
that
was
doomed
immediately
afterward
another
crash
was
heard
the
bowsprit
of
the
had
snapped
and
the
two
ships
were
now
clear
of
each
other
as
the
liner
steamed
ahead
the
boy
saw
the
big
broken
bowsprit
dangling
in
the
bow
of
the
other
vessel
and
he
also
saw
great
clouds
of
sails
drop
down
upon
the
crew
the
liner
proceeded
on
her
course
at
full
speed
and
the
sailing
vessel
was
soon
lost
to
sight
in
the
fog
the
last
thing
the
boy
saw
was
the
men
trying
to
get
out
from
under
the
mass
of
sails
thereupon
the
vessel
disappeared
as
completely
as
if
it
had
slipped
in
behind
a
great
wall
it
has
already
gone
down
thought
the
lad
and
now
he
stood
listening
for
distress
calls
then
a
rough
and
powerful
voice
was
heard
to
shout
across
to
the
steamer
save
your
passengers
put
out
your
boats
again
there
was
silence
and
again
the
boy
listened
for
distress
calls
then
the
voice
was
heard
as
if
from
far
away
pray
to
god
for
you
are
lost
at
that
moment
an
old
sailor
stepped
up
to
the
captain
we
have
a
big
hole
amidships
we
are
going
down
he
said
quietly
and
impressively
soon
after
the
nature
of
the
accident
had
become
known
on
the
steamer
a
little
lady
appeared
on
deck
she
had
come
from
one
of
the
cabins
with
certain
and
determined
step
she
was
dressed
from
top
to
toe
and
her
bonnet
strings
were
tied
in
a
natty
bowknot
she
was
a
little
old
lady
with
crimped
hair
round
eyes
and
a
florid
complexion
during
the
short
time
the
voyage
had
lasted
she
had
managed
to
become
acquainted
with
every
one
on
board
everybody
knew
that
her
name
was
miss
hoggs
and
she
had
told
them
all
the
crew
as
well
as
passengers
time
and
again
that
she
was
never
afraid
she
see
why
she
need
have
any
fear
she
would
have
to
die
at
one
time
or
another
she
had
said
and
whether
it
happened
soon
or
late
was
immaterial
to
her
nor
was
she
afraid
now
she
had
gone
up
on
deck
simply
to
see
if
anything
interesting
or
exciting
was
going
on
there
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
two
sailors
darting
past
with
wild
terrified
faces
stewards
half
dressed
came
running
out
from
their
quarters
to
go
down
and
waken
the
passengers
and
get
them
on
deck
an
old
sailor
came
up
with
an
armful
of
life
belts
which
he
tossed
on
the
deck
a
little
cabin
boy
in
his
shirt
was
crouching
in
a
corner
sobbing
and
shrieking
that
he
was
going
to
die
the
captain
was
on
his
bridge
and
miss
hoggs
heard
him
give
orders
to
stop
the
engines
and
to
man
the
lifeboats
engineers
and
stokers
came
rushing
up
the
grimy
ladder
leading
from
the
engine
room
shouting
that
the
water
had
already
reached
the
fires
miss
hoggs
had
hardly
been
on
deck
a
moment
before
it
was
thronged
with
steerage
passengers
who
had
come
up
in
a
body
shrieking
that
they
would
have
to
hurry
and
make
for
the
boats
otherwise
none
but
the
first
and
second
class
passengers
would
be
saved
as
the
excitement
and
confusion
increased
miss
hoggs
began
to
realize
that
they
were
in
actual
danger
so
she
quietly
slipped
away
to
the
upper
deck
where
several
hung
in
their
davits
just
outside
the
railing
up
here
there
was
not
a
soul
and
miss
hoggs
without
being
seen
climbed
over
the
railing
and
scrambled
into
one
of
the
boats
suspended
above
the
watery
abyss
as
soon
as
she
was
well
inside
she
congratulated
herself
upon
her
wisdom
and
foresight
that
was
the
advantage
of
having
a
clear
and
cool
head
she
thought
she
knew
that
when
once
the
boat
was
lowered
there
would
be
a
wild
scramble
for
it
the
crush
in
the
gangway
and
on
the
companion
ladder
would
be
something
awful
again
and
again
she
congratulated
herself
on
having
thought
of
getting
into
the
boat
beforehand
miss
hoggs
boat
was
hung
far
aft
but
by
leaning
over
the
edge
of
it
she
could
see
the
companion
ladder
then
she
saw
that
a
boat
had
been
manned
and
that
people
were
getting
into
it
suddenly
a
terrible
cry
went
up
some
one
in
the
excitement
had
fallen
overboard
this
must
have
frightened
the
others
for
cries
arose
from
all
sides
of
the
ship
and
the
passengers
heedlessly
crowded
the
gangway
pushing
and
fighting
their
way
toward
the
ladder
in
the
struggle
many
of
them
went
overboard
a
few
persons
who
saw
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
to
the
ladder
jumped
into
the
sea
thinking
they
would
swim
to
the
boat
just
then
the
lifeboat
already
loaded
to
its
full
capacity
rowed
away
the
people
that
were
in
it
drew
their
knives
and
threatened
to
cut
of
the
fingers
of
any
one
who
attempted
to
get
inside
miss
hoggs
saw
one
boat
after
another
launched
she
also
saw
one
boat
after
another
capsize
under
the
weight
of
those
who
hurled
themselves
down
into
them
the
lifeboats
near
to
hers
were
but
for
some
unaccountable
reason
no
one
had
touched
the
one
in
which
she
was
seated
thank
god
they
are
leaving
my
boat
alone
till
the
worst
is
over
she
thought
and
miss
hoggs
heard
and
saw
dreadful
things
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
suspended
over
a
hell
she
could
not
see
the
deck
itself
but
from
the
sounds
that
reached
her
she
gathered
that
a
frightful
struggle
was
taking
place
there
she
heard
pistol
shots
and
saw
blue
smoke
clouds
rise
in
the
air
at
last
there
came
a
moment
when
everything
was
hushed
this
would
be
the
right
time
to
lower
my
boat
thought
miss
hoggs
she
was
not
at
all
afraid
but
sat
back
with
perfect
composure
until
the
steamer
began
to
settle
then
for
the
first
time
it
dawned
on
miss
hoggs
that
was
sinking
and
that
her
boat
had
been
forgotten
on
board
the
steamer
was
a
young
american
matron
a
gordon
who
was
on
her
way
to
europe
to
visit
her
parents
who
for
some
years
had
been
living
in
paris
she
had
her
two
little
boys
with
her
and
all
three
were
asleep
in
their
cabin
when
the
accident
occurred
the
mother
was
immediately
awakened
and
soon
managed
to
get
the
children
partly
dressed
then
throwing
a
cloak
over
her
night
robe
she
went
out
into
the
narrow
passageway
between
the
cabins
the
passage
was
full
of
people
who
had
rushed
out
from
their
staterooms
to
hurry
on
deck
here
it
was
not
difficult
to
pass
but
in
the
companionway
there
was
a
terrible
crush
she
saw
people
pushing
and
crowding
with
no
thought
of
any
one
but
themselves
as
more
than
a
hundred
persons
all
at
one
time
tried
to
rush
up
the
young
american
woman
stood
holding
her
two
children
by
the
hand
she
looked
longingly
up
the
stairway
wondering
how
she
could
manage
to
press
through
the
throng
with
her
little
ones
the
people
fought
and
struggled
thinking
only
of
themselves
no
one
even
noticed
her
gordon
glanced
anxiously
about
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
one
who
would
take
one
of
the
boys
and
carry
him
to
the
deck
while
she
herself
took
the
other
but
she
saw
no
one
she
dared
approach
the
men
came
dashing
past
dressed
every
which
way
some
were
wrapped
in
blankets
others
had
on
ulsters
over
their
nightshirts
and
many
of
them
carried
canes
when
she
saw
the
desperate
look
in
the
eyes
of
these
men
she
felt
that
it
would
not
be
safe
to
speak
to
them
of
the
women
on
the
other
hand
she
had
no
fear
but
there
was
not
one
even
among
them
to
whom
she
would
dare
entrust
her
child
they
were
all
out
of
their
senses
and
could
not
have
comprehended
what
she
wanted
of
them
she
stood
regarding
them
wondering
whether
there
might
not
be
one
perhaps
who
had
a
bit
of
reason
left
but
seeing
them
rush
wildly
past
some
hugging
the
flowers
they
had
received
on
their
departure
from
new
york
others
shrieking
and
wringing
their
hands
she
knew
it
was
useless
to
appeal
to
such
frenzied
people
finally
she
attempted
to
stop
a
young
man
who
had
been
her
neighbour
at
table
and
had
shown
her
marked
attention
oh
martens
the
man
glowered
at
her
with
the
same
fixed
savage
stare
that
she
had
seen
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
men
he
raised
his
cane
threateningly
and
had
she
tried
to
detain
him
he
would
have
struck
her
the
next
moment
she
heard
a
howl
which
was
hardly
a
howl
but
rather
an
angry
murmur
as
when
a
strong
and
sweeping
wind
becomes
bottled
up
in
a
narrow
passage
it
came
from
the
people
on
the
companionway
whose
progress
had
been
suddenly
impeded
a
cripple
had
been
borne
part
way
up
the
stairs
a
man
who
was
so
entirely
helpless
that
he
had
to
be
carried
to
and
from
the
table
he
was
a
large
heavy
man
and
his
valet
had
with
the
greatest
difficulty
managed
to
bear
him
on
his
back
halfway
up
the
stairs
where
he
had
paused
to
take
breath
in
the
meantime
the
pressure
from
behind
had
become
so
tremendous
that
it
had
forced
him
to
his
knees
and
he
and
his
master
were
taking
up
the
whole
width
of
the
stairway
thus
creating
an
impassable
obstruction
presently
gordon
saw
a
big
man
bend
down
lift
up
the
cripple
and
throw
him
over
the
banister
she
also
marked
that
horrible
as
was
this
spectacle
no
one
seemed
to
be
either
shocked
or
moved
by
it
for
nobody
thought
of
anything
save
to
rush
ahead
it
was
as
if
a
stone
lying
in
the
road
had
been
picked
up
and
tossed
into
the
ditch
nothing
more
the
young
american
mother
saw
that
among
these
people
there
was
no
hope
of
being
saved
she
and
her
children
were
doomed
there
were
a
young
bride
and
groom
on
board
who
were
on
their
honeymoon
their
cabin
was
far
down
in
the
body
of
the
ship
and
they
had
slept
so
soundly
that
they
had
not
even
heard
the
collision
nor
was
there
much
commotion
in
their
part
of
the
boat
afterward
and
as
no
one
had
thought
of
calling
them
they
were
still
asleep
when
every
one
else
was
on
deck
fighting
for
the
lifeboats
but
they
woke
when
the
propeller
which
the
whole
night
had
been
revolving
directly
under
their
heads
suddenly
stopped
the
husband
hurriedly
drew
on
a
garment
or
two
and
ran
out
to
see
what
was
up
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
he
carefully
closed
the
cabin
door
after
him
before
uttering
a
word
then
he
said
the
ship
is
sinking
at
the
same
time
he
sat
down
and
when
his
wife
would
have
rushed
out
he
begged
her
to
remain
with
him
the
boats
have
all
gone
he
said
most
of
the
passengers
have
been
drowned
and
those
who
are
still
on
the
ship
are
now
up
on
deck
fighting
desperately
for
rafts
and
life
belts
he
told
her
that
in
the
gangway
he
was
obliged
to
step
over
a
woman
who
had
been
trampled
to
death
and
that
he
had
heard
the
cries
of
the
doomed
on
all
sides
there
no
chance
of
our
being
saved
so
do
go
out
let
us
die
together
the
young
bride
felt
that
he
was
right
and
resignedly
sat
down
beside
him
you
would
like
to
see
all
those
people
struggling
and
fighting
he
said
since
we
got
to
die
anyway
let
us
at
least
have
a
peaceful
death
she
knew
that
it
was
no
more
than
right
that
she
should
stay
there
with
him
the
few
short
moments
of
life
still
left
to
them
had
she
not
promised
to
give
him
a
whole
life
time
of
devotion
i
had
hoped
he
went
on
that
after
we
had
been
married
many
many
years
you
would
be
sitting
by
me
when
i
lay
on
my
deathbed
and
i
would
thank
you
for
a
long
and
happy
life
partnership
at
that
moment
she
saw
a
thin
streak
of
water
trickling
in
through
the
crack
under
the
door
this
was
too
much
for
her
she
threw
up
her
arms
in
despair
i
ca
she
cried
let
me
go
i
ca
stay
shut
in
here
waiting
for
death
i
love
you
but
i
ca
do
it
she
rushed
out
just
as
the
ship
heeled
over
before
going
down
young
gordon
was
lying
in
the
water
the
steamer
had
sunk
her
children
were
lost
and
she
herself
had
been
deep
under
the
sea
she
had
then
come
to
the
surface
for
the
third
time
and
knew
that
in
another
moment
she
would
be
sinking
again
and
that
that
would
mean
death
then
her
mind
no
longer
dwelt
upon
her
husband
or
children
or
upon
anything
else
of
this
earth
she
thought
only
of
lifting
up
her
soul
to
god
and
her
soul
rose
like
a
liberated
prisoner
her
spirit
rejoicing
in
the
thought
of
casting
off
the
heavy
shackles
of
human
existence
jubilantly
prepared
to
ascend
to
its
real
home
is
death
so
easy
she
mused
as
that
thought
came
to
her
the
medley
of
confusing
noises
around
her
the
surging
of
the
waves
the
murmur
of
the
wind
the
shrieks
of
the
drowning
and
the
noises
made
by
the
colliding
of
the
various
objects
that
were
drifting
around
on
the
water
all
seemed
to
resolve
themselves
into
words
in
the
same
way
as
shapeless
clouds
sometimes
form
themselves
into
pictures
and
this
was
what
she
heard
it
is
a
fact
that
death
is
easy
but
to
live
that
is
the
difficult
thing
ah
so
it
is
she
thought
and
wondered
what
was
needed
to
make
living
as
easy
as
dying
round
about
her
the
shipwrecked
people
fought
and
struggled
for
the
floating
wreckage
and
the
overturned
boats
but
amid
the
mad
cries
and
curses
again
the
noises
resolved
themselves
into
clear
and
powerful
words
that
which
is
needed
to
make
life
as
easy
as
death
is
unity
unity
unity
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
lord
of
all
the
earth
had
converted
these
noises
into
a
speaking
tube
through
which
he
himself
had
answered
her
while
the
words
that
had
been
spoken
were
still
ringing
in
her
ears
she
was
rescued
she
had
been
drawn
up
into
a
small
boat
in
which
there
were
only
three
persons
besides
herself
a
brawny
old
sailor
dressed
in
his
best
an
elderly
woman
with
round
owlish
eyes
and
a
poor
little
heartbroken
boy
who
had
on
nothing
but
a
torn
shirt
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
a
norwegian
ship
sailed
along
the
great
banks
of
newfoundland
in
the
direction
of
the
fishing
grounds
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
sea
was
like
a
mirror
the
vessel
could
make
but
little
headway
all
the
sails
were
set
so
as
to
catch
the
last
breaths
of
the
dying
breeze
the
sea
looked
very
beautiful
it
was
a
clear
blue
and
smooth
as
glass
but
where
the
faintest
breeze
passed
over
it
it
was
a
silvery
white
when
the
afternoon
stillness
had
continued
for
a
while
the
crew
sighted
a
dark
object
floating
on
the
water
gradually
it
came
nearer
and
soon
they
discovered
that
it
was
a
human
body
as
it
was
being
carried
by
the
current
past
the
ship
they
could
tell
by
the
clothing
that
it
was
the
body
of
a
sailor
it
was
lying
on
its
back
with
eyes
wide
open
and
with
a
look
of
peace
on
its
face
evidently
the
body
had
not
been
long
enough
in
the
water
to
become
disfigured
it
was
as
if
the
sailor
were
complacently
letting
himself
be
rocked
by
the
tiny
rippling
wavelets
when
the
sailors
turned
their
gaze
in
the
opposite
direction
they
let
out
a
cry
before
they
could
turn
their
faces
another
body
appeared
on
the
surface
close
to
the
bow
of
the
boat
they
came
near
passing
over
it
but
at
the
last
moment
it
was
washed
away
by
the
swell
now
they
all
rushed
to
the
side
of
the
ship
and
looked
down
this
time
they
saw
the
body
of
a
child
a
daintily
dressed
little
girl
dear
dear
said
the
sailors
drying
their
eyes
the
poor
little
kiddie
as
the
body
of
the
little
girl
drifted
past
it
seemed
as
if
the
child
were
looking
up
at
them
and
there
was
such
a
serious
expression
in
its
wistful
if
it
were
out
upon
some
very
urgent
errand
immediately
after
one
of
the
sailors
shouted
that
he
saw
another
body
and
the
same
thing
was
said
by
one
who
was
looking
in
an
opposite
direction
all
at
once
they
saw
five
bodies
they
saw
ten
and
then
there
were
so
many
they
could
not
count
them
the
ship
moved
slowly
on
among
all
these
dead
people
who
surrounded
the
vessel
as
if
they
wanted
something
some
came
floating
in
large
groups
they
looked
like
driftwood
that
had
been
carried
away
from
land
but
they
were
just
a
mass
of
dead
bodies
the
sailors
stood
aghast
afraid
to
move
they
could
hardly
believe
that
what
they
saw
was
real
all
at
once
they
seemed
to
see
an
island
rising
up
out
of
the
sea
from
a
distance
it
looked
like
land
but
on
coming
nearer
they
saw
hundreds
of
bodies
floating
close
together
and
surrounding
the
vessel
on
all
sides
they
moved
with
the
ship
as
if
wanting
to
make
the
voyage
across
the
water
in
its
company
then
the
skipper
turned
the
rudder
so
as
to
coax
a
little
wind
into
the
sails
but
it
did
not
help
much
the
sails
hung
limp
and
the
dead
bodies
continued
to
follow
the
sailors
turned
ashen
and
silence
fell
upon
them
the
ship
had
so
little
headway
that
she
could
not
seem
to
get
clear
of
the
dead
they
were
fearful
lest
it
should
go
on
like
this
the
whole
night
then
a
swedish
seaman
stood
up
in
the
bow
and
repeated
the
prayer
thereupon
he
began
to
sing
a
hymn
when
he
had
got
half
through
the
hymn
the
sun
went
down
and
the
evening
breeze
came
along
and
carried
the
ship
away
from
the
region
of
the
dead
hellgum
letter
an
old
woman
came
out
from
her
little
log
cabin
in
the
woods
although
it
was
only
a
week
day
she
was
dressed
in
her
best
as
if
for
church
after
locking
her
door
she
put
the
key
in
its
usual
place
under
the
stoop
when
the
old
woman
had
gone
a
few
paces
she
turned
round
to
look
at
her
cabin
which
appeared
very
small
and
very
gray
under
the
shadow
of
the
towering
fir
trees
she
glanced
at
her
humble
home
with
an
affectionate
gaze
many
a
happy
day
have
i
spent
in
that
little
old
hut
she
mused
solemnly
ah
me
the
lord
giveth
and
the
lord
taketh
away
then
she
went
on
her
way
down
the
forest
road
she
was
very
old
and
exceeding
fragile
but
she
was
one
of
those
who
hold
themselves
erect
and
firm
however
much
old
age
may
try
to
bend
them
she
had
a
sweet
face
and
soft
white
hair
she
looked
so
mild
and
gentle
that
it
was
surprising
to
hear
her
speak
with
a
voice
that
was
as
strident
and
solemn
as
that
of
some
old
evangelist
she
had
a
long
tramp
ahead
of
her
for
she
was
going
down
to
the
ingmar
farm
to
a
meeting
of
the
hellgumists
old
eva
gunnersdotter
was
one
of
the
most
zealous
converts
to
hellgum
teachings
ah
those
were
glorious
times
she
mumbled
to
herself
as
she
trudged
on
in
the
beginning
when
half
the
parish
had
gone
over
to
hellgum
who
would
have
thought
that
so
many
were
going
to
backslide
and
that
after
five
years
there
would
be
hardly
more
than
a
score
of
us
left
not
counting
the
children
of
course
her
thoughts
went
back
to
the
time
when
she
who
for
many
years
had
lived
in
solitude
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
forgotten
by
every
one
all
at
once
had
found
a
lot
of
brothers
and
sisters
who
came
to
her
in
her
loneliness
who
never
forgot
to
clear
a
path
to
her
cabin
after
a
big
snowfall
and
who
always
kept
her
little
shed
well
filled
with
dry
firewood
and
all
without
her
having
to
ask
for
it
she
recalled
to
mind
the
time
when
karin
daughter
of
ingmar
and
her
sisters
and
many
more
of
the
best
people
in
the
parish
used
to
come
and
hold
love
feasts
in
her
little
gray
cabin
alas
that
so
many
should
have
abandoned
the
only
true
way
of
salvation
she
sighed
now
retribution
will
come
upon
us
next
summer
we
must
all
perish
because
so
few
among
us
have
heard
the
call
and
because
those
who
have
heard
it
have
not
continued
steadfast
the
old
woman
then
fell
to
pondering
over
hellgum
letters
those
letters
which
the
hellgumists
regarded
as
apostolic
writings
and
read
aloud
at
all
their
meetings
as
the
bible
is
read
in
the
churches
there
was
a
time
when
hellgum
was
as
milk
and
honey
to
us
she
reflected
then
he
commanded
us
to
be
kind
and
tolerant
toward
the
unconverted
and
to
show
gentle
forbearance
toward
those
who
had
fallen
away
he
taught
the
rich
that
in
their
works
of
charity
they
must
treat
the
just
and
the
unjust
alike
but
lately
he
has
been
as
wormwood
and
gall
he
writes
about
nothing
but
trials
and
punishments
the
old
woman
had
now
reached
the
edge
of
the
forest
from
where
she
could
look
down
over
the
village
it
was
a
lovely
day
in
february
the
snow
had
spread
its
white
purity
over
the
whole
district
all
the
trees
were
deep
in
their
winter
sleep
and
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
but
she
was
thinking
that
all
this
beautiful
country
wrapped
in
peaceful
slumber
would
soon
be
awakened
only
to
be
consumed
by
a
rain
of
fire
and
brimstone
everything
that
was
now
lying
under
a
cover
of
snow
she
seemed
to
see
enveloped
in
flame
he
has
put
it
into
plain
words
thought
the
old
woman
but
he
keeps
writing
all
the
while
about
a
mercy
me
who
could
wonder
at
it
if
this
parish
were
to
be
punished
as
was
sodom
and
overthrown
like
babylon
as
eva
gunnersdotter
wandered
through
the
village
she
could
not
look
up
at
a
single
house
without
picturing
to
herself
how
the
coming
earthquake
would
shake
it
and
crumble
it
into
dust
and
ashes
and
when
she
met
people
along
the
way
she
thought
of
how
the
monsters
of
hell
would
soon
hunt
and
devour
them
ah
here
comes
the
schoolmaster
gertrude
she
remarked
to
herself
as
she
saw
a
pretty
young
girl
coming
down
the
road
her
eyes
sparkle
like
sunbeams
on
the
snow
she
feels
happy
now
because
she
expects
to
be
married
in
the
fall
to
young
ingmar
ingmarsson
i
see
she
has
a
bundle
of
thread
tucked
under
her
arm
she
is
going
to
weave
table
covers
and
bed
hangings
for
her
new
home
but
before
that
weaving
is
done
destruction
will
be
upon
us
the
old
woman
cast
dark
glances
about
her
she
could
see
that
the
village
had
grown
and
developed
into
an
astonishing
thing
of
beauty
but
she
thought
that
all
these
pretty
houses
with
their
fancy
gables
and
their
big
bowed
windows
would
collapse
the
same
as
her
humble
gray
cabin
where
moss
grew
in
the
cracks
between
the
logs
and
the
windows
were
only
holes
in
the
wall
when
she
reached
the
heart
of
the
town
she
stopped
short
and
struck
her
cane
hard
against
the
pavement
a
sudden
feeling
of
indignation
had
seized
her
woe
woe
she
cried
in
so
loud
a
voice
that
people
in
the
street
paused
and
looked
round
yea
in
all
these
houses
live
such
as
have
rejected
the
gospel
of
christ
and
cling
to
the
enemy
teaching
why
did
they
listen
to
the
call
and
turn
away
from
their
sins
on
their
account
we
must
all
perish
god
hand
strikes
heavily
it
strikes
both
the
just
and
the
unjust
when
she
had
crossed
the
river
she
was
overtaken
by
some
of
the
other
hellgumists
they
were
corporal
felt
and
bullet
gunner
and
his
wife
brita
shortly
afterward
they
were
joined
by
hök
matts
ericsson
his
son
gabriel
and
gunhild
the
daughter
of
councilman
clementsson
all
these
people
in
their
gayly
coloured
national
costumes
made
a
pretty
picture
walking
along
the
road
but
to
the
mind
of
eva
gunnersdotter
they
were
only
doomed
prisoners
being
led
to
the
place
of
execution
like
cattle
driven
to
slaughter
the
hellgumists
looked
quite
dejected
they
walked
along
their
eyes
on
the
ground
as
if
weighed
down
by
a
terrible
load
of
discouragement
they
had
all
expected
that
the
celestial
kingdom
would
suddenly
spread
over
the
whole
earth
and
that
they
would
live
to
see
the
day
when
the
new
jerusalem
should
come
down
from
the
clouds
of
heaven
but
now
that
they
had
become
so
few
in
number
and
could
not
help
seeing
that
theirs
was
a
forlorn
hope
it
was
as
if
something
within
them
had
snapped
they
moved
slowly
and
with
dragging
steps
now
and
then
a
sigh
would
escape
them
but
they
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
for
this
had
been
a
matter
of
supreme
earnest
with
them
they
had
staked
their
all
upon
it
and
had
lost
why
do
they
look
so
wondered
the
old
woman
they
do
seem
to
believe
the
worst
and
do
want
to
understand
what
hellgum
writes
i
tried
to
explain
his
words
to
them
but
they
wo
even
listen
to
me
alas
those
who
live
on
the
lowlands
under
an
open
sky
can
never
understand
what
it
is
to
be
afraid
they
do
think
the
same
thoughts
as
do
those
of
us
who
live
in
the
solitude
of
the
dark
forest
she
could
see
that
the
hellgumists
were
uneasy
because
halvor
had
called
them
together
on
a
week
day
they
feared
that
he
was
going
to
tell
them
of
more
desertions
from
their
ranks
they
glanced
anxiously
at
one
another
with
a
look
of
distrust
in
their
eyes
that
seemed
to
say
how
long
will
you
hold
out
and
you
and
you
we
might
as
well
stop
right
now
they
thought
and
break
up
the
society
at
once
after
all
sudden
death
would
be
easier
than
slowly
wasting
away
alas
that
this
little
community
with
its
gospel
of
peace
this
blissful
life
of
unity
and
brotherly
love
which
had
meant
so
much
to
all
of
them
that
this
should
now
be
doomed
as
these
disheartened
people
walked
along
toward
the
farm
the
sparkling
winter
sun
rolled
merrily
on
across
the
blue
sky
from
the
glistening
snow
rose
a
refreshing
coolness
which
should
have
put
life
and
courage
into
them
while
from
the
hills
encircling
the
parish
there
fell
a
soothing
peace
and
stillness
at
last
they
were
at
the
ingmar
farm
in
the
of
the
farmhouse
close
to
the
ceiling
hung
an
old
picture
which
had
been
painted
by
some
local
artist
a
hundred
years
before
their
time
it
represented
a
city
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
above
which
could
be
seen
the
roofs
and
gables
of
many
buildings
some
of
which
were
red
farmhouses
with
turf
roofs
others
were
white
manor
houses
with
slate
roofs
others
again
showed
massive
towers
after
the
manner
of
the
kistine
church
at
falun
outside
the
city
wall
were
promenading
gentlemen
in
kneebreeches
and
buckled
shoes
who
carried
bengal
canes
a
coach
was
seen
driving
out
of
the
gateway
of
the
town
in
which
were
seated
ladies
in
powdered
wigs
and
wearing
watteau
hats
beyond
the
wall
were
trees
with
a
profusion
of
dark
green
foliage
and
on
the
ground
between
patches
of
tall
waving
grass
ran
little
shimmering
brooklets
at
the
bottom
of
the
picture
was
painted
in
large
ornate
letters
this
is
god
holy
city
jerusalem
the
old
canvas
being
hung
like
that
so
close
to
the
ceiling
it
seldom
attracted
any
notice
most
of
the
people
who
visited
the
ingmar
farm
did
not
even
know
of
its
being
there
but
that
day
it
was
enframed
in
a
wreath
of
green
whortleberry
twigs
so
that
it
instantly
caught
the
eye
of
the
caller
eva
gunnersdotter
saw
it
at
once
and
remarked
under
her
breath
aha
now
the
folks
on
the
ingmar
farm
know
that
we
must
perish
why
they
want
us
to
turn
our
eyes
toward
the
heavenly
city
karin
and
halvor
came
forward
to
greet
her
looking
even
more
gloomy
and
low
spirited
than
the
other
hellgumists
it
plain
they
know
now
that
the
end
is
near
she
thought
eva
gunnersdotter
being
the
oldest
person
present
was
placed
at
the
head
of
the
long
table
in
front
of
her
lay
an
opened
letter
with
american
stamps
on
the
envelope
another
letter
has
come
from
our
dear
brother
hellgum
said
halvor
this
is
why
i
have
called
the
brothers
and
sisters
together
i
gather
that
you
must
think
this
a
very
important
document
halvor
said
bullet
gunner
thoughtfully
i
do
replied
halvor
now
we
shall
learn
what
hellgum
meant
when
he
wrote
in
his
last
letter
that
a
great
trial
of
our
faith
was
before
us
i
do
think
that
any
of
us
will
be
afraid
to
suffer
in
the
lord
cause
gunner
assured
him
all
the
hellgumists
had
not
yet
arrived
and
there
was
a
long
wait
before
the
last
one
finally
made
his
appearance
old
eva
gunnersdotter
with
her
eyes
meanwhile
sat
gazing
at
hellgum
letter
she
was
reminded
of
the
letter
with
the
seven
seals
in
revelation
and
fancied
that
the
instant
any
human
hand
should
touch
that
letter
the
angel
of
destruction
would
come
flying
down
from
heaven
she
raised
her
eyes
and
glanced
up
at
the
jerusalem
picture
yes
yes
she
mumbled
of
course
i
want
to
go
to
that
city
whose
gates
are
of
gold
and
whose
walls
are
of
crystal
and
she
began
reading
to
herself
the
foundations
of
the
wall
of
the
city
were
garnished
with
all
manner
of
precious
stones
the
first
foundation
was
jasper
the
second
sapphire
the
third
a
chalcedony
the
fourth
an
emerald
the
fifth
sardonyx
the
sixth
sardius
the
seventh
chrysolite
the
eighth
beryl
the
ninth
a
topaz
the
tenth
a
chrysoprasus
the
eleventh
a
jacinth
the
twelfth
an
amethyst
the
old
woman
was
so
deep
in
her
precious
book
of
revelation
that
she
started
as
if
she
had
been
caught
napping
when
halvor
went
over
to
that
end
of
the
table
where
the
letter
lay
we
will
open
our
meeting
with
a
hymn
halvor
announced
let
us
all
join
in
singing
number
two
hundred
and
and
the
hellgumists
sang
in
unison
jerusalem
my
happy
home
eva
gunnersdotter
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
because
the
dreaded
moment
had
been
put
off
for
a
little
that
a
doddering
old
woman
like
me
should
be
so
afraid
to
die
she
thought
half
ashamed
of
her
weakness
at
the
close
of
the
hymn
halvor
took
up
the
letter
and
began
unfolding
it
whereupon
the
spirit
moved
eva
gunnersdotter
to
arise
and
offer
up
a
lengthy
prayer
for
grace
to
receive
in
a
proper
spirit
the
message
contained
therein
halvor
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
stood
quietly
waiting
till
she
had
finished
then
he
began
reading
it
in
a
tone
he
might
have
used
had
he
been
delivering
a
sermon
my
dear
brothers
and
sisters
peace
be
with
you
hitherto
i
had
thought
that
i
and
you
who
have
embraced
my
teaching
were
alone
in
this
our
faith
but
praise
be
to
god
here
in
chicago
we
have
found
brethren
who
are
likeminded
who
think
and
act
in
accordance
with
the
principles
for
be
it
known
unto
you
that
here
in
chicago
there
lived
in
the
early
eighties
a
man
by
the
name
of
edward
gordon
he
and
his
wife
were
people
they
were
sorely
grieved
at
seeing
so
much
distress
in
the
world
and
prayed
god
that
grace
might
be
given
them
to
help
the
sorrowing
ones
it
so
happened
that
the
wife
of
edward
gordon
had
to
make
a
long
voyage
across
the
sea
where
she
suffered
shipwreck
and
was
cast
upon
the
waters
when
she
found
herself
in
the
most
extreme
peril
the
voice
of
god
spoke
to
her
and
the
voice
of
god
commanded
her
to
teach
mankind
to
live
in
unity
and
the
woman
was
saved
from
the
sea
and
the
peril
of
death
and
she
returned
to
her
husband
and
told
him
about
the
message
from
god
is
a
great
command
our
lord
hath
given
unto
us
that
we
should
live
in
unity
and
we
must
follow
it
so
great
is
this
message
that
in
all
the
world
there
is
but
one
spot
worthy
of
receiving
it
let
us
therefore
gather
our
friends
together
and
go
with
them
to
jerusalem
that
we
may
proclaim
god
holy
commandment
from
the
mount
of
zion
then
edward
gordon
and
his
wife
together
with
thirty
others
who
wanted
to
obey
the
lord
last
holy
commandment
set
out
for
jerusalem
where
all
of
them
are
now
living
in
concord
under
one
roof
they
share
with
one
another
all
their
worldly
goods
and
serve
one
another
each
protecting
the
other
welfare
and
they
have
taken
into
their
home
the
children
of
the
poor
and
they
nurse
the
sick
they
care
for
the
aged
and
succour
all
who
appeal
to
them
for
aid
without
expecting
either
money
or
gifts
in
return
but
they
do
not
preach
in
the
churches
or
on
street
corners
for
they
say
is
our
works
that
shall
speak
for
us
but
the
people
who
heard
of
their
way
of
living
said
of
them
must
be
fools
and
fanatics
and
those
who
decried
them
the
loudest
were
the
christians
who
had
come
to
palestine
to
convert
jews
and
mohammedans
by
preaching
and
teaching
and
they
said
sort
of
persons
are
these
who
do
not
preach
no
doubt
they
have
come
hither
to
lead
an
evil
life
and
to
indulge
their
sinful
lusts
among
the
heathen
and
they
raised
a
cry
against
these
good
people
that
travelled
across
the
seas
all
the
way
to
their
own
country
but
amongst
those
who
had
settled
in
jerusalem
there
was
a
rich
widow
with
her
two
children
she
had
left
a
brother
in
her
native
land
to
whom
every
one
was
saying
can
you
allow
your
sister
to
live
among
those
dreadful
people
who
are
so
loose
lived
they
are
nothing
but
idlers
who
live
upon
her
bounty
so
the
brother
began
legal
proceedings
against
the
sister
in
order
to
compel
her
to
send
her
children
back
to
america
to
be
reared
there
and
on
account
of
these
proceedings
the
widow
with
her
children
returned
to
chicago
accompanied
by
edward
gordon
and
his
wife
at
that
time
they
had
been
living
in
jerusalem
fourteen
years
when
they
came
back
from
that
far
country
the
newspapers
had
much
to
say
of
them
and
some
called
them
lunatics
and
some
said
they
were
impostors
when
halvor
had
read
thus
far
he
paused
a
moment
and
presently
repeated
the
substance
of
what
he
had
read
in
his
own
words
so
that
everybody
would
understand
it
after
which
he
went
on
reading
but
there
is
in
chicago
a
home
of
which
you
have
heard
and
the
occupants
of
this
home
are
people
who
try
to
serve
god
in
spirit
and
in
truth
who
share
all
things
in
common
and
watch
over
each
other
lives
we
who
live
in
this
home
read
something
in
a
newspaper
about
these
who
had
come
back
from
jerusalem
and
said
among
ourselves
people
are
of
our
faith
they
are
banded
together
to
work
for
righteousness
the
same
as
ourselves
we
would
like
to
meet
these
persons
who
share
our
ideals
and
we
wrote
and
asked
them
to
come
to
see
us
and
those
who
had
come
back
from
jerusalem
accepted
the
invitation
and
called
and
we
compared
our
teachings
with
theirs
and
found
that
our
principles
of
faith
were
the
same
is
by
the
grace
of
god
that
we
have
found
each
other
we
said
they
told
us
of
the
glories
of
the
holy
city
that
city
which
lies
resplendent
on
its
white
mountain
and
we
deemed
them
fortunate
in
that
they
had
been
privileged
to
tread
the
paths
our
saviour
had
trod
then
one
of
our
own
brethren
said
should
we
go
along
with
you
to
jerusalem
they
answered
must
not
accompany
us
thither
for
god
holy
city
is
full
of
strife
and
dissension
of
want
and
sickness
of
hate
and
poverty
instantly
another
of
our
brethren
cried
god
has
sent
you
to
us
because
it
is
his
meaning
that
we
shall
go
with
you
to
that
far
country
to
help
you
fight
all
this
then
one
and
all
of
us
heard
the
voice
of
the
spirit
in
our
hearts
say
this
is
my
will
then
we
asked
them
whether
they
would
be
willing
to
receive
us
into
their
fold
although
we
were
poor
and
unlettered
and
they
answered
that
they
would
then
we
determined
to
become
brethren
in
the
fullest
sense
and
they
accepted
our
faith
and
we
theirs
and
all
the
while
the
spirit
was
upon
us
and
we
were
filled
with
a
great
gladness
and
we
said
we
know
that
god
loves
us
since
he
sends
us
to
that
land
where
once
he
sent
his
own
son
and
now
we
know
that
our
teaching
is
the
right
teaching
inasmuch
as
god
wants
it
proclaimed
from
his
holy
mountain
zion
and
then
a
third
member
of
our
own
household
said
there
are
our
brothers
and
sisters
at
home
in
sweden
so
we
told
the
brethren
from
jerusalem
that
there
were
more
of
us
than
they
saw
here
that
we
also
had
some
brothers
and
sisters
in
sweden
we
said
are
being
sorely
tried
in
their
fight
for
righteousness
many
of
them
have
fallen
away
and
the
few
who
have
remained
steadfast
are
obliged
to
live
among
unbelievers
then
the
travellers
from
jerusalem
answered
your
brothers
and
sisters
in
sweden
follow
us
to
jerusalem
and
share
our
holy
work
at
first
we
were
pleased
at
the
thought
of
your
following
us
and
living
with
us
at
jerusalem
in
peace
and
harmony
but
afterward
we
began
to
feel
troubled
and
said
will
never
leave
their
fine
farms
and
old
occupations
and
the
jerusalem
travellers
answered
and
meadows
we
can
not
offer
them
but
they
will
be
allowed
to
wander
along
the
pathways
where
jesus
feet
have
trod
but
we
were
still
doubtful
and
said
to
them
will
never
journey
to
a
strange
land
where
no
one
understands
their
speech
and
the
travellers
from
jerusalem
answered
will
understand
what
the
stones
of
palestine
have
to
tell
them
about
their
saviour
we
said
will
never
divide
their
property
with
strangers
and
become
poor
as
beggars
nor
will
they
renounce
their
authority
for
they
are
the
leading
people
of
their
own
parish
the
travellers
from
jerusalem
answered
have
neither
power
nor
worldly
possessions
to
offer
them
but
we
invite
them
to
become
participants
in
the
sufferings
of
christ
their
redeemer
when
that
was
said
we
were
again
filled
with
gladness
and
felt
that
you
would
come
and
now
my
dear
brothers
and
sisters
when
you
have
read
this
do
not
talk
it
over
among
yourselves
but
be
still
and
listen
and
whatever
the
spirit
bids
you
do
that
do
halvor
folded
the
letter
saying
now
we
must
do
as
hellgum
writes
we
must
be
still
and
listen
there
was
a
long
silence
in
the
at
the
ingmar
farm
old
eva
gunnersdotter
was
as
silent
as
were
the
others
waiting
for
the
voice
of
god
to
speak
to
her
she
interpreted
it
all
in
her
own
way
why
of
course
she
thought
hellgum
wants
us
to
go
to
jerusalem
so
that
we
may
escape
the
great
destruction
the
lord
would
save
us
from
the
flood
of
brimstone
and
preserve
us
from
the
rain
of
fire
and
those
of
us
who
are
righteous
will
hear
the
voice
of
god
warning
us
to
flee
the
wrath
to
come
it
never
for
a
moment
occurred
to
the
old
woman
that
it
could
be
a
sacrifice
for
any
one
to
leave
his
home
and
his
native
land
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
this
sort
it
never
entered
her
mind
that
any
one
could
doubt
the
wisdom
of
leaving
his
native
woodlands
his
smiling
river
and
his
fertile
fields
some
of
the
hellgumists
thought
with
fear
and
trepidation
of
their
having
to
change
their
manner
of
living
of
renouncing
fatherland
parents
friends
and
relatives
but
not
she
to
her
it
simply
meant
that
god
wanted
to
spare
them
as
he
had
once
spared
noah
and
lot
were
they
not
being
called
to
a
life
of
supernal
glory
in
god
holy
city
it
was
to
her
as
if
hellgum
had
written
that
they
would
be
bodily
taken
up
into
heaven
like
the
prophet
elijah
they
were
all
sitting
with
closed
eyes
deep
in
meditation
some
were
suffering
such
intense
mental
agony
that
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
their
foreheads
ah
this
is
indeed
the
trial
which
hellgum
foretold
they
sighed
the
sun
was
at
the
horizon
and
shot
its
piercing
rays
into
the
room
the
crimson
glow
from
the
setting
sun
cast
a
glare
upon
the
many
blanched
faces
finally
martha
ingmarsson
the
wife
of
ljung
björn
olofsson
slipped
down
from
her
chair
on
to
her
knees
then
one
after
another
they
all
went
down
on
their
knees
all
at
once
several
of
them
drew
a
deep
breath
and
a
smile
lighted
up
their
faces
then
karin
daughter
of
ingmar
said
in
a
tone
of
wonderment
i
hear
god
voice
calling
me
gunhild
the
daughter
of
councillor
clementsson
lifted
up
her
hands
in
ecstasy
and
tears
streamed
down
her
face
i
too
am
going
she
cried
god
voice
calls
me
whereupon
krister
larsson
and
his
wife
said
almost
in
the
same
breath
it
cries
into
my
ear
that
i
must
go
i
can
hear
voice
calling
me
the
call
came
to
one
after
another
and
with
it
all
anguish
of
mind
and
all
feeling
of
regret
vanished
a
great
sense
of
joy
had
come
to
them
they
thought
no
more
of
their
farms
or
their
relatives
they
were
thinking
only
of
how
their
little
colony
would
branch
out
and
blossom
anew
and
of
the
wonder
of
having
been
called
to
the
holy
city
the
call
had
now
come
to
most
of
them
but
it
had
not
yet
reached
halvor
halvorsson
he
was
wrestling
in
anguished
prayer
thinking
god
would
not
call
him
as
he
had
called
the
others
he
sees
that
i
love
my
fields
and
meadows
more
than
his
word
he
said
to
himself
i
am
unworthy
karin
then
went
up
to
halvor
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
brow
you
must
be
still
halvor
and
listen
in
silence
halvor
wrung
his
hands
so
hard
that
the
joints
of
his
fingers
cracked
perhaps
god
does
not
deem
me
worthy
to
go
he
said
yes
halvor
you
will
be
let
go
but
you
must
be
still
said
karin
she
knelt
down
beside
him
and
put
her
arm
around
him
now
listen
quietly
halvor
and
without
fear
in
a
few
moments
the
tense
look
was
gone
from
his
face
i
hear
i
hear
something
far
far
away
he
whispered
it
is
the
harps
of
angels
announcing
the
presence
of
the
lord
said
the
wife
be
quite
still
now
halvor
then
she
nestled
very
close
to
him
something
she
had
never
done
before
in
the
presence
of
others
ah
he
exclaimed
clapping
his
hands
now
i
have
heard
it
it
spoke
so
loudly
that
it
was
as
thunder
in
my
ears
shall
go
to
my
holy
city
jerusalem
it
said
have
you
all
heard
it
in
the
same
way
yes
yes
they
cried
we
have
all
heard
it
but
now
old
eva
gunnersdotter
began
to
wail
i
have
heard
nothing
i
ca
go
along
with
you
i
like
lot
wife
and
may
not
flee
the
wrath
to
come
but
must
be
left
behind
here
i
must
stay
and
be
turned
into
a
pillar
of
salt
she
wept
from
despair
and
the
hellgumists
all
gathered
round
to
pray
with
her
still
she
heard
nothing
and
her
despair
became
a
thing
of
terror
i
ca
hear
anything
she
groaned
but
got
to
take
me
along
you
sha
leave
me
to
perish
in
the
lake
of
fire
you
must
wait
eva
said
the
hellgumists
the
call
may
come
it
will
surely
come
either
or
in
the
morning
you
do
answer
me
cried
the
old
woman
you
do
tell
what
i
want
to
know
maybe
you
do

to
take
me

if
no
call
comes
to
me
it
will
come

the
hellgumists
shouted

screamed
the
old
woman
in
a
frenzy

we
ca
take
you
along
if
god
does
call
you
the
hellgumists
protested
but
the
call
will
come
never
fear
then
the
old
dame
suddenly
rose
from
her
kneeling
attitude
straightened
her
rickety
old
body
and
brought
her
cane
down
on
the
floor
with
a
thud
you
people
mean
to
go
away
and
leave
me
to
perish
she
thundered
yes
yes
yes
you
mean
to
go
and
let
me
perish
she
had
become
furiously
angry
and
once
more
they
saw
before
them
eva
gunnersdotter
as
she
had
been
in
her
younger
days
strong
and
passionate
and
fiery
i

with

she
shrieked
i
do
want

be
saved
by

abandon

and

fie

a
parcel
of
idiots
to
be
leaving
your
good
farms
you
a
lot
of
misguided
fools
running
after
false
prophets
that
what
you
are
it
upon
you
that
fire
and
brimstone
will
rain
it
is
you
who
must
perish
but
we
who
remain
at
home
we
shall
live
the
big
log
at
dusk
on
this
same
beautiful
february
day
two
young
lovers
stood
talking
together
in
the
road
the
youth
had
just
driven
down
from
the
forest
with
a
big
log
which
was
so
heavy
that
the
horse
could
hardly
pull
it
all
the
same
he
had
driven
in
a
roundabout
way
so
that
the
log
might
be
hauled
through
the
village
and
past
the
big
white
schoolhouse
the
horse
had
been
halted
in
front
of
the
school
and
a
young
woman
had
come
out
to
have
a
look
at
the
log
she
could
seem
to
say
enough
in
praise
of
it
how
long
and
thick
it
was
and
how
straight
and
what
a
lovely
tan
bark
it
had
and
how
firm
the
wood
was
and
how
flawless
the
young
man
then
told
her
very
impressively
that
it
had
been
grown
on
a
moor
far
north
of
olaf
peak
and
when
he
had
felled
it
and
how
long
it
had
been
lying
in
the
forest
to
dry
out
he
told
her
exactly
how
many
inches
it
measured
both
in
circumference
and
diameter
but
ingmar
she
said
it
is
only
the
first
pleased
as
she
was
the
thought
that
ingmar
had
been
five
years
getting
down
the
first
bit
of
timber
toward
the
building
of
their
new
home
made
her
feel
uneasy
but
ingmar
seemed
to
think
that
all
difficulties
had
now
been
met
just
you
wait
gertrude
he
said
if
i
can
only
get
the
timber
hauled
while
the
roads
are
passable
we
soon
have
the
house
up
it
was
turning
bitterly
cold
the
horse
stood
there
all
of
a
shiver
shaking
its
head
and
stamping
its
hoofs
its
mane
and
forelock
white
with
hoar
frost
but
the
youth
and
the
maid
did
not
feel
the
cold
they
kept
themselves
warm
by
building
their
house
in
imagination
from
cellar
to
attic
when
they
had
got
the
house
done
they
set
about
to
furnish
it
we
put
the
sofa
over
against
the
long
wall
here
in
the
ingmar
decided
but
i
do
know
that
we
got
any
sofa
said
gertrude
the
young
man
bit
his
lip
he
had
not
meant
to
tell
her
until
some
time
later
that
he
had
a
sofa
in
readiness
at
the
cabinetmaker
shop
but
now
he
had
unwittingly
let
out
the
secret
then
gertrude
too
came
out
with
something
which
she
had
kept
from
him
for
five
years
she
told
him
that
she
had
made
up
hair
into
ornaments
and
had
woven
fancy
ribbons
for
sale
and
with
the
money
she
had
earned
in
this
way
she
had
bought
all
sorts
of
household
things
pots
and
pans
platters
and
dishes
sheets
and
pillow
slips
table
covers
and
rugs
ingmar
was
so
pleased
over
what
gertrude
had
accomplished
that
he
could
not
seem
to
commend
her
enough
in
the
middle
of
his
praises
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
gazed
at
her
in
speechless
adoration
he
thought
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
that
anything
so
sweet
and
so
beautiful
would
some
day
be
his
very
own
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
strangely
asked
the
girl
i
just
thinking
that
the
best
of
it
all
is
that
you
will
be
mine
gertrude
could
not
say
anything
but
she
ran
her
hand
caressingly
over
the
big
log
which
was
to
form
a
portion
of
the
wall
of
that
house
in
which
she
and
ingmar
were
to
live
she
felt
that
protection
and
love
were
in
store
for
her
for
the
man
she
was
going
to
marry
was
good
and
wise
noble
and
faithful
just
then
an
old
woman
passed
by
she
walked
rapidly
muttering
to
herself
as
if
terribly
incensed
over
something
aye
aye
their
happiness
shall
last
no
longer
than
from
daybreak
to
rosy
dawn
when
the
trial
comes
their
faith
will
be
broken
as
though
it
were
a
rope
spun
from
moss
and
their
lives
shall
be
as
a
long
darkness
surely
she
ca
mean
us
said
the
young
girl
how
could
that
apply
to
us
laughed
the
young
man
the
ingmar
farm
it
was
the
day
after
the
meeting
of
the
hellgumists
and
a
saturday
a
blizzard
was
raging
the
pastor
who
had
been
called
to
the
bedside
of
a
sick
person
who
lived
way
up
at
the
north
end
of
the
great
forest
was
driving
homeward
late
in
the
evening
under
great
difficulties
his
horse
sank
deep
in
the
snowdrifts
and
the
sledge
was
time
after
time
on
the
point
of
being
upset
both
the
pastor
and
his
hired
man
were
continually
getting
out
to
kick
away
the
snow
for
a
path
happily
it
was
not
very
dark
the
moon
came
rolling
out
from
behind
the
snow
clouds
big
and
full
shedding
its
silvery
light
upon
the
ground
glancing
upward
the
pastor
noticed
that
the
air
was
thick
with
whirling
and
flying
snowflakes
in
some
places
they
made
their
way
quite
easily
there
were
short
stretches
of
road
where
the
flying
snow
had
not
settled
and
others
where
the
snow
was
deep
but
loose
and
even
the
really
troublesome
thing
was
trying
to
get
over
the
ground
where
the
drifts
were
piled
so
high
that
one
could
not
even
look
over
them
and
where
they
were
obliged
to
turn
from
the
road
and
to
drive
across
fields
and
hedges
at
the
risk
of
being
dumped
into
a
ditch
or
having
the
horse
spiked
on
a
fence
rail
both
the
pastor
and
his
servant
spoke
with
much
concern
of
the
drift
which
always
after
a
heavy
snow
was
banked
against
a
high
boarding
close
to
the
ingmar
farm
if
we
can
only
clear
that
we
are
as
good
as
at
home
they
said
the
pastor
remembered
how
often
he
had
asked
big
ingmar
to
remove
the
high
boarding
that
was
the
cause
of
so
much
snow
drifting
toward
that
particular
spot
but
nothing
had
ever
been
done
about
it
even
though
everything
else
on
the
ingmar
farm
had
undergone
changes
certainly
those
old
boards
were
never
disturbed
at
last
they
were
within
sight
of
the
farm
and
sure
enough
there
was
the
snowdrift
in
its
usual
place
as
high
as
a
wall
and
as
hard
as
a
rock
here
there
was
no
possibility
of
their
turning
to
one
side
they
had
no
choice
but
to
drive
right
over
it
the
thing
looked
impossible
so
the
servant
asked
whether
he
had
better
go
down
to
the
farm
and
get
some
help
but
to
this
the
pastor
would
not
consent
he
had
not
exchanged
a
word
with
either
karin
or
halvor
in
upward
of
five
years
and
the
thought
of
meeting
old
friends
with
whom
one
is
no
longer
on
speaking
terms
was
no
more
pleasant
to
him
than
it
is
to
most
people
so
up
the
drift
the
horse
had
to
mount
the
icy
crust
held
until
the
animal
had
reached
the
top
then
it
gave
way
and
the
horse
suddenly
disappeared
from
sight
as
if
into
a
grave
while
the
two
men
sat
gazing
down
helplessly
one
of
the
traces
had
snapped
so
they
could
not
have
gone
farther
even
if
they
had
been
able
to
get
the
horse
out
of
the
drift
a
few
minutes
later
the
pastor
stepped
into
the
at
the
ingmar
farm
a
blazing
log
fire
was
burning
on
the
hearth
the
housewife
sat
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
spinning
fine
carded
wool
behind
her
were
the
maids
seated
in
a
long
row
spinning
flax
the
men
had
taken
possession
of
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
they
had
just
come
in
from
their
work
some
were
resting
others
to
pass
the
time
had
taken
up
some
light
work
such
as
whittling
sticks
sharpening
rakes
and
making
axe
handles
when
the
pastor
told
of
his
mishap
they
all
bestirred
themselves
and
the
menservants
went
out
to
dig
the
horse
out
of
the
drift
halvor
led
the
pastor
up
to
the
table
and
asked
him
to
sit
down
karin
sent
the
maids
into
the
kitchen
to
make
fresh
coffee
and
to
prepare
a
special
supper
then
she
took
the
pastor
big
fur
coat
and
hung
it
in
front
of
the
fire
to
dry
lighted
the
hanging
lamp
and
moved
her
spinning
wheel
up
to
the
table
so
that
she
could
talk
with
the
menfolk
i
could
have
had
a
better
welcome
had
big
ingmar
himself
been
alive
thought
the
pastor
halvor
talked
at
length
about
the
weather
and
the
state
of
the
roads
then
he
asked
the
clergyman
if
he
had
got
a
good
price
for
his
grain
and
if
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
certain
repairs
made
that
he
had
been
wanting
for
such
a
long
time
karin
then
asked
after
the
pastor
wife
and
hoped
that
there
had
been
some
improvement
in
her
health
of
late
at
that
point
the
pastor
man
came
in
and
reported
that
the
horse
had
been
dug
out
the
trace
mended
and
that
all
was
in
readiness
to
start
but
karin
and
halvor
pressed
the
pastor
to
stay
to
supper
and
would
not
take
no
for
an
answer
the
coffee
tray
was
brought
in
on
it
were
the
large
silver
coffee
urn
and
the
precious
old
silver
sugar
bowl
which
was
never
used
save
at
such
high
functions
as
weddings
and
funerals
and
there
were
three
big
silver
cake
baskets
full
of
fresh
rusks
and
cookies
the
pastor
small
round
eyes
grew
big
with
astonishment
he
sat
as
if
in
a
trance
afraid
of
being
awakened
halvor
showed
the
pastor
the
skin
of
an
elk
which
had
been
shot
in
the
woods
on
the
ingmar
farm
the
skin
was
then
spread
out
upon
the
floor
the
pastor
declared
that
he
had
never
seen
a
larger
or
more
beautiful
hide
then
karin
went
up
to
halvor
and
whispered
in
his
ear
immediately
halvor
turned
to
the
clergyman
and
asked
him
to
accept
the
skin
as
a
gift
karin
bustled
back
and
forth
between
the
table
and
the
cupboard
and
brought
out
some
choice
old
silverware
she
had
spread
a
fine
hemstitched
cloth
on
the
table
which
she
was
dressing
as
if
for
a
grand
party
she
poured
milk
and
unfermented
beer
into
huge
silver
jugs
when
they
had
finished
supper
the
pastor
excused
himself
and
rose
to
go
halvor
halvorsson
and
two
of
his
hired
men
went
with
him
to
open
a
way
through
the
drifts
steadying
the
sledge
whenever
it
was
about
to
upset
and
never
leaving
him
till
he
was
safe
within
his
own
dooryard
the
parson
was
thinking
how
pleasant
it
was
to
renew
old
friendships
as
he
bade
halvor
a
hearty
halvor
stood
feeling
for
something
in
his
pocket
presently
he
pulled
out
a
slip
of
folded
paper
he
wondered
whether
the
pastor
would
mind
taking
it
now
it
was
an
announcement
which
was
to
be
read
after
the
service
in
the
morning
if
the
pastor
would
be
good
enough
to
take
it
it
would
save
him
the
bother
of
sending
it
to
the
church
by
a
special
messenger
when
the
pastor
had
gone
inside
he
lighted
the
lamp
unfolded
the
paper
and
read
in
consequence
of
the
owner
contemplated
removal
to
jerusalem
the
ingmar
farm
is
offered
for
sale
he
read
no
farther
well
well
so
now
it
has
come
upon
us
he
murmured
as
if
speaking
of
a
storm
this
is
what
i
been
expecting
for
many
a
long
year
hök
matts
ericsson
it
was
a
beautiful
day
in
spring
a
peasant
and
his
son
were
on
their
way
to
the
great
ironworks
which
are
situated
close
to
the
southern
boundary
of
the
parish
as
they
lived
up
at
the
north
end
they
had
to
traverse
almost
the
entire
length
of
the
parish
they
went
past
newly
sown
fields
where
the
grain
was
just
beginning
to
spring
up
they
saw
all
the
green
rye
fields
and
all
the
fine
meadows
where
the
clover
would
soon
be
reddening
and
sending
forth
its
sweet
fragrance
they
also
walked
past
a
number
of
houses
which
were
being
repainted
and
fitted
up
with
new
windows
and
verandas
and
past
gardens
where
spading
and
planting
were
going
on
all
whom
they
met
along
the
way
had
muddy
shoes
and
grimy
hands
from
working
in
fields
and
vegetable
gardens
where
they
had
been
planting
potatoes
setting
out
cabbages
and
sowing
turnips
and
carrots
the
peasant
simply
had
to
stop
and
ask
them
what
kind
of
potatoes
they
were
planting
and
just
when
they
had
sown
their
oats
at
sight
of
a
calf
or
a
foal
he
at
once
began
to
figure
out
how
old
it
was
he
calculated
the
number
of
cows
they
would
be
likely
to
keep
at
such
and
such
a
farm
and
wondered
how
much
this
or
that
colt
would
fetch
when
broken
the
son
tried
time
after
time
to
turn
his
father
thought
away
from
such
things
i
thinking
that
you
and
i
will
soon
be
wandering
through
the
valley
of
sharon
and
the
desert
of
judea
he
said
the
father
smiled
and
his
face
brightened
for
a
moment
it
will
indeed
be
a
blessed
privilege
to
walk
in
the
footsteps
of
our
dear
lord
jesus
he
answered
but
the
next
minute
on
seeing
a
couple
of
cartloads
of
quicklime
his
thoughts
were
diverted
i
say
gabriel
who
do
you
suppose
is
hauling
lime
folks
say
that
lime
as
a
fertilizer
makes
a
rich
crop
that
will
be
something
to
feast
your
eyes
on
in
the
fall
in
the
fall
father
said
the
son
reprovingly
yes
i
know
returned
the
farmer
that
by
fall
i
shall
be
dwelling
in
the
tents
of
jacob
and
labouring
in
the
vineyard
amen
cried
the
son
so
be
it
amen
then
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
space
watching
the
signs
of
spring
water
trickled
in
the
ditches
and
the
road
itself
was
badly
broken
up
from
the
spring
rains
whichever
way
they
looked
there
was
work
to
be
done
every
one
wanted
to
turn
to
and
help
even
when
crossing
some
field
other
than
his
own
to
tell
the
truth
said
the
farmer
thoughtfully
i
wish
i
had
sold
my
property
some
fall
when
the
work
was
over
it
hard
having
to
leave
it
all
in
the
springtime
just
when
you
like
to
take
hold
with
might
and
main
the
son
only
shrugged
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
let
the
old
man
talk
it
just
years
now
since
i
as
a
young
man
bought
a
piece
of
waste
land
on
the
north
side
of
this
parish
said
the
farmer
the
ground
had
never
been
touched
by
a
spade
half
of
it
was
bog
the
other
half
a
mass
of
stones
it
looked
pretty
bad
on
that
very
land
i
worked
like
a
slave
digging
up
stones
until
my
back
was
ready
to
break
but
i
think
i
laboured
even
harder
with
the
swamp
before
i
finally
got
it
drained
and
filled
in
yes
you
have
certainly
worked
hard
father
the
son
admitted
this
is
why
god
thinks
of
you
and
summons
you
to
his
holy
land
at
first
the
farmer
went
on
i
lived
in
a
hovel
that
much
better
than
a
charcoaler
hut
it
was
made
of
unstripped
logs
with
only
sod
for
a
roof
i
could
never
make
that
but
water
tight
so
the
rains
always
came
in
it
was
mighty
uncomfortable
especially
at
night
the
cow
and
the
horse
fared
no
better
than
i
the
whole
of
the
first
winter
they
were
housed
in
a
mud
cave
that
was
as
dark
as
a
cellar
father
how
can
you
be
so
attached
to
a
place
where
you
have
suffered
such
hardships
but
only
think
of
the
joy
of
it
when
i
was
able
to
build
a
big
barn
for
the
animals
and
when
year
by
year
my
livestock
increased
so
that
i
was
always
having
to
add
new
extensions
for
housing
them
if
i
were
not
going
to
sell
the
place
now
i
should
have
to
put
a
new
roof
on
the
barn
this
would
have
been
just
the
time
to
do
it
as
soon
as
i
finished
with
the
sowing
father
you
are
to
do
your
sowing
in
that
land
where
some
seeds
fall
among
thorns
some
on
stony
ground
some
by
the
wayside
and
some
on
good
ground
and
the
old
cottage
the
farmer
pursued
which
i
built
after
the
first
hut
i
had
thought
of
pulling
down
this
year
to
put
up
a
fine
new
dwelling
house
what
to
be
done
now
with
all
the
timber
that
we
two
hauled
home
in
the
winter
it
was
mighty
tough
work
getting
it
down
the
horses
were
hard
driven
and
so
were
we
the
son
began
to
feel
troubled
he
thought
his
father
was
slipping
away
from
him
he
feared
that
the
old
man
was
not
going
to
offer
his
property
to
the
lord
in
the
right
spirit
well
he
argued
but
what
are
new
houses
and
barns
as
compared
with
the
blessed
privilege
of
living
a
pure
life
among
people
who
are
of
one
mind
hallelujah
cried
the
father
do
you
suppose
i
know
that
a
wonderful
portion
has
been
allotted
to
us
am
i
not
on
my
way
to
the
works
to
sell
my
property
to
the
company
when
i
come
back
this
way
everything
will
be
gone
and
i
shall
have
nothing
i
can
call
mine
the
son
did
not
reply
but
he
was
pleased
to
hear
that
his
father
still
held
to
his
decision
presently
they
came
to
a
farm
beautifully
situated
on
a
hill
there
was
a
dwelling
house
with
a
balcony
and
a
veranda
and
round
the
house
were
tall
poplars
whose
pretty
silvery
stems
were
swollen
with
sap
look
said
the
farmer
that
was
just
the
sort
of
house
i
meant
to
have
with
a
veranda
and
a
balcony
and
a
lot
of
ornamental
woodwork
and
with
just
such
a
lawn
in
front
that
have
been
nice
gabriel
as
the
son
said
nothing
the
farmer
concluded
that
he
must
be
tired
of
hearing
about
the
farm
so
he
too
lapsed
into
silence
although
his
thoughts
were
still
upon
his
home
he
wondered
how
the
horses
would
fare
with
their
new
owners
and
how
things
in
general
would
be
run
on
the
place
my
goodness
he
muttered
under
his
breath
i
surely
doing
a
foolish
thing
in
selling
out
to
a
corporation
they
go
and
cut
down
all
the
trees
and
let
the
farm
go
to
waste
it
would
be
just
like
them
to
allow
the
land
to
become
marshy
again
and
to
let
the
birch
woods
grow
down
into
the
fields
they
had
at
last
reached
the
works
where
the
farmer
interest
was
again
roused
there
he
saw
ploughs
and
harrows
of
the
latest
pattern
and
was
suddenly
reminded
that
for
a
long
time
he
had
been
thinking
of
getting
a
new
reaper
gazing
fondly
at
his
son
he
pictured
him
sitting
on
a
fine
reaper
cracking
his
whip
over
the
horses
and
mowing
down
the
thick
waving
grass
as
a
war
hero
mows
down
his
enemies
and
as
he
stepped
into
the
office
he
seemed
to
hear
the
clicking
noise
of
the
reaper
the
soft
swish
of
falling
grass
and
the
shrill
chirp
and
light
flutter
of
frightened
birds
and
insects
on
the
desk
in
there
lay
the
deed
the
negotiations
had
been
concluded
and
the
price
settled
upon
all
that
was
needed
to
complete
the
deal
was
his
signature
while
the
deed
was
being
read
to
him
he
sat
quietly
listening
he
heard
that
there
were
so
and
so
many
acres
of
woodland
and
so
and
so
many
of
arable
land
and
meadow
so
and
so
many
head
of
cattle
and
such
and
such
household
furnishings
all
of
which
he
must
turn
over
his
features
became
set
no
he
said
to
himself
it
must
happen
after
the
reading
he
was
about
to
say
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
when
his
son
bent
down
and
whispered
to
him
father
it
a
choice
between
me
and
the
farm
for
i
going
anyway
no
matter
what
you
do
the
peasant
had
been
so
completely
taken
up
with
thoughts
of
his
farm
that
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
his
son
would
leave
him
so
gabriel
would
go
in
any
case
he
could
not
quite
make
this
out
he
would
never
have
thought
of
leaving
had
his
son
decided
to
remain
at
home
but
naturally
wherever
his
son
went
he
too
must
go
he
stepped
up
to
the
desk
where
the
deed
was
now
spread
out
for
him
to
sign
the
manager
himself
handed
him
the
pen
and
pointed
to
the
place
where
he
was
to
write
his
name
here
he
said
here
where
you
write
your
name
in
full
matts
ericsson
when
he
took
the
pen
it
flashed
across
his
mind
how
years
back
he
had
signed
a
deed
whereby
he
had
acquired
a
bit
of
barren
land
he
remembered
that
after
writing
his
name
he
had
gone
out
to
inspect
his
new
property
then
this
thought
had
come
to
him
see
what
god
has
given
you
here
you
have
work
to
keep
you
going
a
lifetime
the
manager
thinking
his
hesitancy
was
due
to
uncertainty
as
to
where
he
should
write
his
name
again
pointed
to
the
place
the
name
must
be
written
there
now
write
matts
ericsson
he
put
the
pen
to
the
paper
this
he
mused
i
write
for
the
sake
of
my
faith
and
my
soul
salvation
for
the
sake
of
my
dear
friends
the
hellgumists
that
i
may
be
allowed
to
live
with
them
in
the
unity
of
the
spirit
and
so
as
not
to
be
left
alone
here
when
they
all
go
and
he
wrote
his
first
name
and
this
he
went
on
thinking
i
write
for
the
sake
of
my
son
gabriel
so
i
sha
have
to
lose
the
dear
good
lad
who
has
always
been
so
kind
to
his
old
father
and
to
let
him
see
that
after
all
he
is
dearer
to
me
than
aught
else
and
then
he
wrote
his
middle
name
but
this
he
thought
as
he
moved
the
pen
for
the
third
time
why
do
i
write
this
then
all
at
once
his
hand
began
to
move
as
of
itself
up
and
down
the
page
leaving
great
black
streaks
upon
the
hateful
document
this
i
do
because
i
an
old
man
and
must
go
on
tilling
the
soil
go
on
plowing
and
sowing
in
the
place
where
i
have
always
worked
and
slaved
hök
matts
ericsson
looked
rather
sheepish
when
he
turned
to
the
manager
and
showed
him
the
paper
you
have
to
excuse
me
sir
he
said
it
really
was
my
intention
to
part
with
my
property
but
when
it
came
to
the
scratch
i
could
do
it
the
auction
one
day
in
may
there
was
an
auction
sale
at
the
ingmar
farm
and
what
a
perfect
day
it
was
quite
as
warm
as
in
the
summertime
the
men
had
all
discarded
their
long
white
sheepskin
coats
and
were
wearing
their
short
jackets
the
women
already
went
about
in
the
white
blouses
which
belonged
with
their
summer
dress
the
schoolmaster
wife
was
getting
ready
to
attend
the
auction
gertrude
did
not
care
to
go
and
storm
was
too
busy
with
his
class
work
when
mother
stina
was
all
ready
to
start
she
opened
the
door
to
the
schoolroom
and
nodded
a
to
her
husband
storm
was
then
telling
the
children
the
story
of
the
destruction
of
the
great
city
of
nineveh
and
the
look
on
his
face
was
so
stern
and
threatening
that
the
poor
youngsters
were
almost
frightened
to
death
mother
stina
on
her
way
to
the
ingmar
farm
stopped
whenever
she
came
to
a
hawthorn
in
bloom
or
a
hillock
decked
with
white
lilies
of
the
valley
where
could
you
find
anything
lovelier
than
this
she
thought
even
if
you
were
to
go
as
far
away
as
jerusalem
the
schoolmaster
wife
like
many
others
had
come
to
love
the
old
parish
more
than
ever
since
the
hellgumists
had
called
it
a
second
sodom
and
wanted
to
abandon
it
she
plucked
a
few
of
the
tiny
wild
flowers
that
grew
by
the
roadside
and
gazed
at
them
almost
tenderly
if
we
were
as
bad
as
they
try
to
make
us
out
she
mused
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
for
god
to
destroy
us
he
need
only
let
the
cold
continue
and
keep
the
ground
covered
with
snow
but
when
our
lord
allows
the
spring
and
the
flowers
to
return
he
must
at
least
think
us
fit
to
live
when
mother
stina
finally
reached
the
ingmar
farm
she
halted
and
glanced
round
timidly
i
think
i
go
back
she
said
to
herself
i
could
never
standby
and
see
this
dear
old
home
broken
up
but
all
the
same
she
was
far
too
curious
to
find
out
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
farm
to
turn
back
as
soon
as
it
became
known
that
the
farm
was
for
sale
ingmar
put
in
a
bid
for
it
but
ingmar
had
only
about
six
thousand
kroner
and
halvor
had
already
been
offered
thousand
by
the
management
of
the
big
bergsana
sawmills
and
ironworks
ingmar
succeeded
in
borrowing
enough
money
to
enable
him
to
offer
an
equally
large
sum
the
company
then
raised
its
bid
to
thirty
thousand
which
was
more
than
ingmar
dared
offer
for
he
could
not
think
of
assuming
so
heavy
a
debt
the
worst
of
it
was
that
not
only
would
the
homestead
by
this
means
pass
out
of
the
hands
of
the
ingmars
for
all
time
for
the
company
was
never
known
to
part
with
anything
once
it
became
its
property
but
moreover
it
was
not
likely
that
it
would
allow
ingmar
to
run
the
sawmill
at
langfors
falls
in
which
case
he
would
be
deprived
of
his
living
then
he
would
have
to
give
up
all
thought
of
marrying
gertrude
in
the
fall
as
had
been
planned
it
might
even
be
necessary
for
him
to
go
elsewhere
to
seek
employment
when
mother
stina
thought
of
this
she
did
not
feel
very
pleasantly
disposed
toward
karin
and
halvor
i
hope
to
goodness
that
karin
wo
come
up
and
speak
to
me
she
muttered
to
herself
for
if
she
does
i
just
have
to
let
her
know
what
i
think
of
her
treatment
of
ingmar
after
all
it
her
fault
that
the
farm
does
not
already
belong
to
him
i
been
told
that
they
need
a
lot
of
money
for
the
journey
just
the
same
it
seems
mighty
strange
that
karin
can
have
the
heart
to
sell
the
old
place
to
a
corporation
that
would
cut
down
all
the
timber
and
let
the
fields
go
to
waste
there
was
some
one
outside
the
corporation
who
wished
to
buy
the
place
it
was
the
rich
district
judge
berger
sven
persson
mother
stina
felt
that
such
an
arrangement
would
be
better
for
ingmar
as
sven
persson
was
a
generous
man
who
would
surely
let
him
keep
the
sawmill
sven
persson
will
not
forget
that
he
was
once
a
poor
goose
boy
on
this
farm
she
reflected
and
that
it
was
big
ingmar
who
first
took
him
in
hand
and
gave
him
a
start
in
life
mother
stina
did
not
go
into
the
house
but
remained
in
the
yard
as
did
most
of
the
people
who
had
come
to
attend
the
sale
she
sat
down
on
a
pile
of
boards
and
began
to
glance
about
her
very
carefully
as
one
is
wont
to
do
when
taking
a
last
look
at
some
beloved
spot
surrounding
the
farmyard
on
three
sides
were
ranges
of
outbuildings
and
in
the
centre
was
a
little
storehouse
propped
on
four
posts
nothing
looked
particularly
old
with
the
exception
of
the
porch
with
the
carved
moulding
at
the
entrance
to
the
and
another
one
still
older
with
stout
twisted
pillars
at
the
entrance
of
the
washhouse
mother
stina
thought
of
all
the
old
ingmarssons
whose
feet
had
trod
the
yard
she
seemed
to
see
them
coming
home
from
their
work
in
the
evening
and
gathering
around
the
hearth
tall
and
somewhat
bent
always
afraid
of
intruding
themselves
or
of
accepting
more
than
they
felt
was
their
due
and
she
thought
of
the
industry
and
honesty
which
had
always
been
practised
on
this
farm
it
ought
never
to
be
allowed
was
her
thought
as
regards
the
auction
the
king
should
be
told
of
it
mother
stina
took
it
more
to
heart
than
if
it
had
been
a
question
of
parting
with
her
own
home
the
sale
had
not
yet
begun
but
a
good
many
people
had
arrived
some
had
gone
into
the
barns
to
look
over
the
live
stock
others
remained
out
in
the
yard
examining
the
farm
implements
placed
there
for
inspection
mother
stina
on
seeing
a
couple
of
peasant
women
come
out
of
a
cowshed
grew
indignant
just
look
at
mother
inga
and
mother
stava
she
muttered
now
they
been
in
and
picked
out
a
cow
apiece
think
how
they
be
going
around
bragging
that
got
a
cow
of
the
old
breed
from
the
ingmar
farm
when
she
saw
old
crofter
nils
trying
to
choose
a
plow
she
smiled
a
little
scornfully
crofter
nils
will
think
himself
a
real
farmer
when
he
can
drive
a
plough
that
big
ingmar
himself
has
used
more
and
more
people
kept
gathering
round
the
things
to
be
auctioned
off
the
men
looked
wonderingly
at
many
of
the
farming
tools
which
were
of
such
make
that
it
was
difficult
to
guess
what
they
had
been
used
for
a
few
spectators
had
the
temerity
to
laugh
at
the
old
sleighs
some
of
which
were
from
ancient
times
and
were
gorgeously
painted
in
red
and
green
and
the
harnesses
that
went
with
them
were
studded
with
white
shells
and
fringed
with
tassels
of
many
colours
mother
stina
seemed
to
see
the
old
ingmarssons
driving
slowly
in
these
old
sleighs
going
to
a
party
or
coming
home
from
a
church
wedding
with
a
bride
seated
beside
them
many
good
people
are
leaving
the
parish
she
sighed
for
to
her
it
was
as
if
all
the
old
ingmars
had
gone
on
living
at
the
farm
up
to
that
very
day
when
their
implements
and
their
old
carts
and
sleds
were
being
hawked
about
i
wonder
where
ingmar
is
keeping
himself
and
how
he
feels
when
it
seems
so
dreadful
to
me
what
must
it
be
for
him
the
weather
being
so
fine
the
auctioneer
proposed
that
they
carry
out
all
the
things
that
were
to
go
under
the
hammer
so
as
to
avoid
any
overcrowding
of
the
rooms
so
maids
and
farm
hands
carried
out
boxes
and
chests
all
painted
in
tulips
and
roses
some
of
them
had
been
standing
in
the
attic
undisturbed
for
centuries
they
also
brought
out
silver
jugs
and
copper
kettles
and
carders
and
all
kinds
of
weaving
appliances
the
peasant
women
gathered
around
all
these
old
treasures
picking
them
up
and
turning
them
over
mother
stina
had
not
intended
to
buy
anything
when
she
remembered
that
there
was
supposed
to
be
a
loom
here
on
which
could
be
woven
the
finest
damask
and
went
up
to
look
for
it
just
then
a
maid
came
out
with
a
huge
bible
which
with
its
thick
leather
bindings
and
its
brass
clasps
and
mountings
was
so
heavy
that
she
could
hardly
carry
it
mother
stina
was
as
astounded
as
if
some
one
had
struck
her
in
the
face
and
went
back
to
her
seat
she
knew
of
course
that
no
one
nowadays
reads
these
old
bibles
with
their
obsolete
and
antiquated
language
but
just
the
same
it
seemed
strange
that
karin
would
want
to
sell
it
it
was
perhaps
the
very
bible
the
old
housewife
was
reading
when
they
came
and
told
her
that
her
husband
the
of
young
ingmar
had
been
killed
by
a
bear
everything
that
mother
stina
saw
had
something
to
tell
her
the
old
silver
buckles
lying
on
the
table
had
been
taken
from
the
trolls
in
mount
klack
by
an
ingmar
ingmarsson
in
the
rickety
chaise
over
yonder
the
ingmar
ingmarsson
who
had
lived
during
her
childhood
had
driven
to
church
she
remembered
that
every
time
he
had
passed
by
her
and
her
mother
on
their
way
to
church
the
mother
had
nudged
her
and
said
now
you
must
curtsy
stina
fox
here
comes
ingmar
ingmarsson
she
used
to
wonder
why
it
was
that
her
mother
always
wanted
her
to
curtsy
to
ingmar
ingmarsson
she
had
never
been
so
particular
when
it
came
to
the
judge
or
the
bailiff
afterward
she
was
told
that
when
her
mother
was
a
little
girl
and
went
to
church
with
her
mother
the
latter
had
always
nudged
her
and
said
you
must
curtsy
stina
for
here
comes
ingmar
ingmarsson
god
knows
sighed
mother
stina
it
not
only
because
i
had
expected
that
gertrude
would
some
day
have
been
mistress
here
that
i
grieve
but
it
seems
to
me
as
if
the
whole
parish
were
done
for
just
then
the
pastor
came
along
looking
solemn
and
depressed
he
did
not
stop
an
instant
but
went
straight
to
the
house
mother
stina
surmised
that
he
had
come
to
plead
ingmar
cause
with
karin
and
halvor
shortly
after
the
manager
of
the
sawmills
at
bergsåna
arrived
and
also
judge
persson
the
manager
who
was
there
in
the
interest
of
the
corporation
straightway
went
inside
but
sven
persson
walked
about
in
the
yard
for
a
while
and
looked
at
the
things
presently
he
stopped
in
front
of
a
little
old
man
with
a
big
beard
who
was
sitting
on
the
same
pile
of
boards
as
mother
stina
i
do
suppose
you
happen
to
know
strong
ingmar
whether
ingmar
ingmarsson
has
decided
to
buy
the
timber
i
offered
him
he
says
no
the
old
man
answered
but
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
were
to
change
his
mind
soon
at
the
same
time
he
winked
and
jerked
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
mother
stina
thus
cautioning
sven
persson
not
to
let
her
hear
what
they
were
talking
about
i
should
think
he
be
satisfied
to
accept
my
terms
said
the
judge
i
do
make
these
offers
everyday
but
this
i
doing
for
big
ingmar
sake
you
right
about
its
being
a
good
offer
the
old
man
agreed
but
he
says
that
he
has
already
made
a
deal
else
where
i
wonder
if
he
has
really
considered
what
it
is
that
he
losing
said
sven
persson
and
walked
on
thus
far
none
of
the
ingmarsson
family
had
been
seen
about
the
yard
but
presently
young
ingmar
was
discovered
standing
leaning
against
a
wall
quite
motionless
and
with
his
eyes
half
closed
now
a
number
of
people
got
up
to
go
over
and
shake
hands
with
him
but
when
they
were
quite
close
they
bethought
themselves
and
went
back
to
their
seats
ingmar
was
deathly
pale
and
every
one
who
looked
at
him
could
see
that
he
was
suffering
keenly
therefore
no
one
ventured
to
speak
to
him
he
stood
so
quietly
that
many
had
not
even
noticed
that
he
was
there
but
those
who
had
could
think
of
nothing
else
here
there
was
none
of
the
merriment
which
usually
prevails
at
auctions
with
ingmar
standing
there
hugging
the
wall
of
the
old
home
he
was
about
to
lose
they
felt
no
inclination
to
laugh
or
to
joke
then
came
a
moment
for
the
opening
of
the
auction
the
auctioneer
mounted
a
chair
and
began
to
offer
the
first
lot
an
old
plow
ingmar
never
moved
he
was
more
like
a
statue
than
a
human
being
good
heavens
why
ca
he
go
away
said
the
people
he
have
to
stay
here
and
witness
this
miserable
business
but
the
ingmarssons
never
behave
like
other
folks
the
hammer
then
fell
for
the
first
sale
ingmar
started
as
if
it
had
caught
him
but
in
a
moment
he
again
became
motionless
but
at
every
ring
of
the
hammer
a
shudder
went
through
him
two
peasant
women
passed
just
in
front
of
mother
stina
they
were
talking
about
ingmar
think
if
he
had
only
proposed
to
some
rich
farmer
daughter
he
might
have
had
enough
money
to
buy
the
farm
but
of
course
going
to
marry
the
schoolmaster
gertrude
said
one
they
say
that
a
rich
and
influential
man
has
offered
to
give
him
the
ingmar
farm
as
a
wedding
present
if
he
will
marry
his
daughter
said
the
other
you
see
they
do
mind
his
being
poor
because
he
belongs
to
such
a
good
family
anyway
there
some
advantage
in
being
the
son
of
big
ingmar
it
would
indeed
have
been
a
good
thing
if
gertrude
had
had
a
little
so
that
she
could
have
given
him
a
lift
thought
mother
stina
when
all
the
farming
implements
had
been
sold
the
auctioneer
moved
over
to
another
part
of
the
yard
where
the
household
linens
were
piled
he
then
bean
to
offer
for
sale
fabrics
table
cloths
bed
linen
and
hangings
holding
them
up
so
that
the
embroidered
tulips
and
the
various
fancy
weaves
could
be
seen
all
over
the
yard
ingmar
must
have
noticed
the
light
flutter
of
the
linen
pieces
as
they
were
being
held
aloft
for
he
involuntarily
glanced
up
for
a
moment
his
tired
eyes
looked
out
upon
the
desecration
then
he
turned
away
i
never
seen
the
like
of
that
said
a
young
peasant
girl
the
poor
boy
looks
as
if
he
were
dying
if
he
only
go
away
instead
of
standing
here
tormenting
himself
mother
stina
suddenly
jumped
to
her
feet
as
if
to
cry
out
that
this
thing
must
be
stopped
then
she
sat
down
again
i
must
forget
that
i
only
a
poor
old
woman
she
sighed
all
at
once
there
was
a
dead
silence
which
made
mother
stina
look
up
the
silence
was
due
to
the
sudden
appearance
of
karin
who
had
just
come
out
from
the
house
now
it
was
quite
plain
what
they
all
thought
of
karin
and
her
dealings
for
as
she
went
across
the
yard
every
one
drew
back
no
one
put
out
a
hand
to
greet
her
no
one
spoke
to
her
they
simply
stared
disapprovingly
karin
looked
tired
and
worn
and
stooped
more
than
usual
a
bright
red
spot
appeared
on
both
cheeks
and
she
looked
as
miserable
as
in
the
days
when
she
had
had
her
struggles
with
elof
she
had
come
out
to
find
mother
stina
and
ask
her
to
go
inside
i
did
know
till
just
now
that
you
were
here
mother
storm
she
said
mother
stina
at
first
declined
but
was
finally
persuaded
we
want
all
the
old
antagonisms
to
be
forgotten
now
that
we
are
going
away
said
karin
while
they
were
going
toward
the
house
mother
stina
ventured
this
must
be
a
trying
day
for
you
karin
karin
only
response
was
a
sigh
i
do
see
how
you
can
have
the
heart
to
sell
all
these
old
things
karin
it
is
what
one
loves
most
that
one
must
first
and
foremost
sacrifice
to
the
lord
said
karin
folks
think
it
strange
mother
stina
began
but
karin
cut
her
short
the
lord
too
would
think
it
strange
if
we
held
back
anything
we
had
offered
in
his
name
mother
stina
bit
her
lip
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
say
anything
further
all
the
reproaches
which
she
had
meant
to
heap
upon
karin
stuck
in
her
throat
there
was
an
air
of
lofty
dignity
about
karin
that
disarmed
people
therefore
no
one
had
the
courage
to
upbraid
her
when
they
were
on
the
broad
step
in
front
of
the
porch
mother
stina
tapped
karin
on
the
shoulder
have
you
noticed
who
is
standing
over
there
she
asked
and
pointed
to
ingmar
karin
winced
a
little
but
was
careful
not
to
look
over
at
her
brother
the
lord
will
find
a
way
out
for
him
she
murmured
the
lord
will
surely
find
away
out
to
all
appearances
the
was
not
much
changed
by
reason
of
the
auction
for
in
there
the
seats
and
cupboards
and
bedsteads
were
stationary
but
shining
copper
utensils
no
longer
adorned
the
walls
the
bedsteads
looked
bare
stripped
of
their
coverings
and
hangings
and
the
doors
of
the
cupboards
which
in
the
old
days
were
always
left
standing
half
open
to
let
visitors
see
the
great
silver
jugs
and
beakers
that
filled
its
shelves
were
now
closed
which
meant
that
there
was
nothing
inside
worth
showing
the
only
wall
decoration
the
room
boasted
was
the
jerusalem
canvas
which
on
that
day
had
a
fresh
wreath
around
it
the
large
room
was
thronged
with
relatives
and
coreligionists
of
halvor
and
karin
one
after
another
they
were
conducted
with
much
ceremony
to
a
large
table
for
refreshments
the
door
to
the
inside
room
was
closed
in
there
negotiations
for
the
sale
of
the
farm
itself
were
pending
the
talking
was
loud
and
heated
especially
on
the
part
of
the
pastor
in
the
on
the
other
hand
the
people
were
very
quiet
and
when
any
one
spoke
it
was
in
hushed
tones
for
every
thoughts
were
in
the
little
room
where
the
fate
of
the
farm
was
being
settled
mother
stina
turned
to
gabriel
saying
i
suppose
there
no
chance
of
ingmar
getting
the
farm
the
bidding
has
gone
far
beyond
his
figure
by
now
gabriel
replied
the
innkeeper
from
karmsund
is
said
to
have
offered
thousand
and
the
company
bid
has
been
raised
to
the
pastor
is
now
trying
to
persuade
karin
and
halvor
to
let
it
go
to
the
innkeeper
rather
than
to
the
company
but
what
about
berger
sven
persson
it
seems
that
he
has
not
made
any
bid
the
pastor
was
still
talking
he
was
evidently
pleading
with
some
one
they
could
not
hear
what
he
said
but
they
knew
that
no
decision
had
been
reached
or
the
pastor
would
not
have
gone
on
talking
then
came
a
moment
of
silence
after
which
the
innkeeper
was
heard
to
say
not
exactly
loudly
but
with
a
clearness
that
made
every
word
carry
i
bid
thousand
not
that
i
think
the
place
is
worth
that
much
but
i
ca
bear
the
thought
of
its
becoming
a
corporation
property
immediately
after
there
was
a
noise
as
of
some
one
striking
a
table
with
his
fist
and
the
manager
of
the
company
was
heard
to
shout
i
bid
forty
thousand
and
more
than
that
karin
and
halvor
are
not
likely
to
get
mother
stina
who
had
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
got
up
and
went
back
to
the
yard
it
was
dreary
enough
out
there
but
not
as
insufferable
as
sitting
in
the
close
room
listening
to
the
haggling
the
sale
of
linen
was
over
the
auctioneer
had
again
changed
his
place
and
was
about
to
cry
out
the
old
family
silverware
the
heavy
silver
jugs
inlaid
with
gold
coin
and
the
beakers
bearing
inscriptions
from
the
seventeenth
century
when
he
held
up
the
first
jug
ingmar
started
forward
as
if
to
stop
the
sale
but
restrained
himself
at
once
and
went
back
to
his
place
a
few
minutes
later
an
old
peasant
came
bearing
the
silver
jug
which
he
respectfully
deposited
at
ingmar
feet
you
must
keep
this
as
a
souvenir
of
all
that
by
right
should
have
been
yours
he
said
again
a
tremor
passed
through
ingmar
body
his
lips
quivered
and
he
tried
to
say
something
you
need
say
anything
now
said
the
old
peasant
that
will
keep
till
another
time
he
withdrew
a
few
paces
then
suddenly
turned
back
i
hear
that
folks
are
saying
you
could
take
over
the
farm
if
you
cared
to
it
would
be
the
greatest
service
you
could
render
this
parish
there
were
a
number
of
old
servants
living
at
the
farm
who
had
been
there
from
early
youth
now
that
old
age
had
overtaken
them
they
still
stayed
on
and
over
these
hung
a
pall
of
uncertainty
such
as
had
not
touched
the
others
they
feared
that
under
a
new
master
they
would
be
turned
out
of
their
old
home
to
become
beggars
or
whatever
happened
they
knew
in
their
hearts
that
no
stranger
would
care
for
them
as
their
old
master
and
mistress
had
done
these
poor
old
pensioners
wandered
restlessly
about
the
farmyard
all
day
long
seeing
them
shrink
past
frail
and
helpless
with
a
look
of
hopeless
appeal
in
their
weak
watery
eyes
every
one
felt
sorry
for
them
finally
one
old
man
who
was
nearly
a
hundred
hobbled
up
to
ingmar
and
sat
down
on
the
ground
quite
close
to
him
it
seemed
to
be
the
only
place
where
he
could
be
at
ease
for
there
he
remained
quietly
resting
his
shaky
old
hands
on
the
crook
of
his
cane
and
as
soon
as
old
lisa
and
cowhouse
martha
saw
where
pickaxe
bengt
had
taken
refuge
they
too
came
tottering
up
and
sat
down
at
feet
they
did
not
speak
to
him
but
somehow
they
must
have
had
a
vague
idea
that
he
would
be
able
to
protect
them
he
who
was
now
ingmar
ingmarsson
ingmar
no
longer
kept
his
eyes
closed
he
stood
looking
down
at
them
as
if
he
were
counting
up
all
the
years
and
all
the
trials
through
which
they
had
lived
serving
his
people
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
first
duty
was
to
see
that
they
be
allowed
to
live
out
their
days
in
their
old
home
he
glanced
out
over
the
yard
caught
the
eye
of
strong
ingmar
and
nodded
to
him
significantly
whereupon
strong
ingmar
without
a
word
went
straight
to
the
house
he
passed
through
the
to
the
inner
room
and
stationed
himself
by
the
door
where
he
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
deliver
his
message
the
pastor
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
talking
to
karin
and
halvor
who
were
sitting
as
stiff
and
motionless
as
a
pair
of
mummies
the
manager
from
bergsåna
was
at
the
table
looking
confident
for
he
knew
that
he
was
in
a
position
to
outbid
all
the
others
the
innkeeper
from
karmsund
was
standing
at
the
window
in
such
a
fever
of
agitation
that
great
beads
of
sweat
came
out
on
his
forehead
and
his
hands
shook
berger
sven
persson
sat
on
the
sofa
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
twiddling
his
thumbs
his
hands
clasped
over
his
stomach
his
big
commanding
face
impassive
the
pastor
was
done
talking
and
halvor
glanced
over
at
karin
for
advice
but
she
sat
as
if
in
a
trance
staring
blankly
at
the
floor
then
halvor
turned
to
the
pastor
and
said
karin
and
i
have
got
to
consider
that
we
are
going
to
a
strange
land
and
that
we
and
the
brethren
must
live
on
the
money
we
can
get
for
the
farm
been
told
that
the
fare
alone
to
jerusalem
will
cost
us
fifteen
thousand
kroner
and
then
afterward
we
must
get
a
house
and
keep
ourselves
in
food
and
clothes
so
we
can
hardly
afford
to
give
anything
away
it
unreasonable
of
you
people
to
expect
karin
and
halvor
to
sell
the
farm
for
a
mere
song
just
because
you
do
want
the
company
to
have
it
said
the
manager
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
well
to
accept
my
offer
at
once
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
put
an
end
to
all
these
useless
arguments
yes
karin
spoke
up
we
better
take
the
highest
bid
but
the
parson
was
not
so
easily
beaten
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
handling
a
worldly
matter
he
always
knew
just
what
to
say
now
he
was
the
man
and
not
the
preacher
i
sure
that
karin
and
halvor
care
enough
about
this
old
farm
to
want
to
sell
to
some
person
who
would
keep
up
the
property
even
if
they
have
to
take
a
couple
of
thousand
kroner
less
he
said
then
he
proceeded
to
tell
for
karin
special
benefit
of
various
farms
that
had
gone
to
waste
after
falling
into
the
hands
of
corporations
once
or
twice
karin
glanced
up
at
the
pastor
he
wondered
whether
he
had
finally
succeeded
in
making
some
impression
upon
her
there
must
surely
be
a
little
of
the
pride
of
the
old
peasant
matron
still
left
in
her
he
thought
as
he
went
on
telling
of
tumbledown
farmhouses
and
underfed
cattle
he
finally
ended
with
these
words
i
know
perfectly
well
that
if
the
corporation
is
fully
determined
to
buy
the
ingmar
farm
it
can
go
on
bidding
against
the
farmers
until
they
are
forced
to
give
up
but
if
karin
and
halvor
want
to
prevent
this
old
place
from
becoming
a
ruined
corporation
property
they
will
have
to
settle
on
a
price
so
that
the
farmers
may
know
what
to
be
guided
by
when
the
pastor
made
that
proposition
halvor
uneasy
glanced
over
at
karin
who
slowly
raised
her
eyelids
certainly
halvor
and
i
would
rather
sell
the
place
to
some
one
of
our
own
kind
then
we
could
go
away
from
here
knowing
that
everything
would
continue
in
the
old
way
if
some
person
outside
the
company
wants
to
give
forty
thousand
for
the
property
we
will
be
satisfied
to
accept
that
sum
for
it
said
halvor
knowing
at
last
what
his
wife
wishes
were
when
that
was
said
strong
ingmar
walked
over
to
sven
persson
and
whispered
to
him
judge
persson
immediately
arose
and
went
up
to
halvor
since
you
say
you
are
willing
to
take
forty
thousand
kroner
for
the
farm
i
buy
it
at
that
figure
he
said
halvor
face
began
to
twitch
and
a
lump
seemed
to
rise
in
his
throat
he
had
to
swallow
before
he
could
speak
thank
you
judge
he
finally
stammered
i
glad
that
i
can
leave
the
farm
in
such
good
hands
judge
persson
then
shook
hands
with
karin
who
was
so
moved
that
she
could
hardly
keep
back
the
tears
you
may
be
sure
karin
that
everything
here
will
be
as
of
old
he
said
are
you
going
to
live
at
the
farm
yourself
karin
inquired
no
said
he
then
added
with
great
solemnity
my
youngest
daughter
is
to
be
married
in
the
summer
and
she
and
her
husband
are
to
have
the
farm
as
a
gift
from
me
he
then
turned
to
the
pastor
and
thanked
him
well
parson
you
have
it
your
own
way
he
said
i
never
dreamed
in
the
days
when
i
was
a
poor
goose
boy
on
this
place
that
some
time
it
would
be
in
my
power
to
arrange
for
an
ingmar
ingmarsson
to
come
back
to
the
ingmar
farm
the
pastor
and
the
other
men
all
stood
staring
at
the
judge
in
dumb
amazement
not
grasping
at
first
what
was
meant
karin
left
the
room
at
once
while
passing
through
the
to
the
yard
she
drew
herself
up
retied
her
headkerchief
and
smoothed
out
her
apron
then
with
an
air
of
solemn
dignity
she
went
straight
up
to
ingmar
and
grasped
his
hand
let
me
congratulate
you
ingmar
she
said
her
voice
shaking
with
joy
you
and
i
have
been
strongly
opposed
to
each
other
of
late
in
matters
of
religion
but
since
god
does
not
grant
me
the
solace
of
having
you
with
us
i
thank
him
for
allowing
you
to
become
master
of
the
old
farm
ingmar
did
not
speak
his
hand
lay
limp
in
karin
and
when
she
let
it
drop
he
stood
there
looking
just
as
unhappy
as
he
had
looked
all
day
the
men
who
had
been
inside
at
the
final
settlement
came
out
now
and
shook
hands
with
ingmar
offering
their
congratulations
good
luck
to
you
ingmar
ingmarsson
of
the
ingmar
farm
they
said
at
that
a
glimmer
of
happiness
crossed
ingmar
face
and
he
murmured
softly
to
himself
ingmar
ingmarsson
of
the
ingmar
farm
he
was
like
a
child
that
has
just
received
a
gift
it
has
long
been
wishing
for
but
the
next
moment
his
expression
changed
to
one
of
intense
revolt
and
repugnance
as
if
he
would
have
thrust
the
coveted
prize
from
him
in
a
flash
the
news
had
spread
over
the
farm
people
talked
loudly
and
questioned
eagerly
some
were
so
pleased
they
wept
for
joy
no
one
listened
now
to
the
cries
of
the
auctioneer
but
everybody
crowded
around
ingmar
to
wish
him
happiness
peasants
and
gentlefolk
friends
and
strangers
alike
ingmar
standing
there
surrounded
by
all
these
happy
people
suddenly
looked
up
he
then
saw
mother
stina
standing
a
little
apart
from
the
others
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
she
was
very
pale
and
looked
old
and
poor
as
he
met
her
gaze
she
turned
and
walked
away
ingmar
hastily
left
the
others
and
hurried
after
her
then
bending
down
to
her
every
muscle
of
his
face
aquiver
with
grief
he
said
in
a
husky
voice
go
home
to
gertrude
mother
stina
and
tell
her
that
i
have
betrayed
her
that
i
sold
myself
for
the
farm
tell
her
never
to
think
more
of
such
a
miserable
wretch
as
i
gertrude
something
strange
had
come
over
gertrude
that
she
could
neither
stay
nor
control
something
that
grew
and
grew
until
it
finally
threatened
to
take
complete
possession
of
her
it
began
at
the
moment
when
she
learned
that
ingmar
had
failed
her
it
was
really
a
boundless
fear
of
seeing
ingmar
again
of
suddenly
meeting
him
on
the
road
or
at
church
or
elsewhere
why
that
would
be
such
a
terrible
thing
she
hardly
knew
but
she
felt
that
she
could
never
endure
it
gertrude
would
have
preferred
shutting
herself
in
day
and
night
so
as
to
be
sure
of
not
meeting
ingmar
but
that
was
not
possible
for
a
poor
girl
like
her
she
had
to
go
out
and
work
in
the
garden
and
every
morning
and
evening
she
was
obliged
to
tramp
the
long
distance
from
the
house
to
the
pasture
to
milk
the
cows
and
she
was
often
sent
to
the
village
store
to
buy
sugar
and
meal
and
whatever
else
was
needed
in
the
house
when
gertrude
went
out
on
the
road
she
would
always
draw
her
kerchief
far
down
over
her
face
keep
her
eyes
lowered
and
rush
on
as
if
fiends
were
pursuing
her
as
soon
as
she
could
she
would
turn
from
the
highroad
and
take
the
narrow
bypaths
alongside
the
ditches
and
drains
where
she
felt
there
was
less
likelihood
of
her
meeting
ingmar
never
for
a
moment
did
she
feel
free
from
fear
for
there
was
not
a
single
place
in
all
the
parish
where
she
could
feel
certain
of
not
running
across
him
if
she
went
rowing
on
the
river
he
might
be
there
floating
his
timber
or
if
she
ventured
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
he
might
cross
her
path
on
his
way
to
work
when
weeding
in
the
garden
she
would
often
glance
down
the
road
so
that
she
might
see
if
he
were
approaching
and
make
her
escape
ingmar
was
so
well
known
about
the
place
that
her
dog
would
not
have
barked
at
sight
of
him
and
her
pigeons
that
strutted
about
the
gravel
walk
would
not
have
flown
up
and
warned
her
of
his
approach
with
the
rustle
of
their
flapping
wings
gertrude
haunting
dread
did
not
diminish
but
rather
increased
from
day
to
day
all
her
grief
had
turned
to
fear
and
her
strength
to
combat
it
grew
less
and
less
soon
i
shall
not
dare
venture
outside
the
door
she
thought
i
may
get
to
be
a
bit
queer
and
morose
even
if
i
do
become
quite
insane
god
god
take
this
awful
fear
away
from
me
she
prayed
i
can
see
that
my
mother
and
father
think
i
not
right
in
my
head
and
every
one
else
must
think
the
same
oh
dear
lord
god
help
me
she
cried
when
this
fear
condition
was
at
its
worst
it
happened
one
night
that
gertrude
had
an
extraordinary
dream
she
dreamed
that
she
had
gone
out
with
her
milk
pail
on
her
arm
to
do
the
milking
the
cows
were
grazing
in
an
enclosed
meadow
near
the
skirt
of
the
forest
a
long
way
from
home
she
went
by
the
narrow
paths
alongside
the
ditches
and
field
drains
she
had
great
difficulty
in
walking
for
she
felt
so
weak
and
weary
that
she
could
hardly
lift
her
feet
what
can
be
the
matter
with
me
she
asked
herself
in
the
dream
why
is
it
so
hard
for
me
to
walk
and
she
also
answered
herself
you
are
tired
because
you
carry
about
with
you
this
heavy
burden
of
sorrow
when
she
finally
got
to
the
pasturage
there
were
no
cows
in
sight
she
became
uneasy
and
began
to
look
for
them
in
their
usual
haunts
behind
the
brushwood
over
by
the
brook
and
under
the
birches
but
there
was
not
a
sign
of
them
while
searching
for
the
cows
she
discovered
a
gap
in
the
hedge
on
the
side
fronting
the
forest
she
grew
terribly
alarmed
and
stood
wringing
her
hands
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
the
cows
must
have
cleared
this
opening
tired
as
i
am
must
i
now
tramp
the
whole
forest
to
find
them
she
whimpered
in
her
dream
but
she
went
straight
on
into
the
woods
slowly
pushing
her
way
through
fir
brush
and
prickly
juniper
bushes
presently
she
found
herself
walking
on
a
smooth
and
even
road
without
knowing
how
she
had
got
there
the
road
was
soft
and
rather
slippery
from
the
brown
fir
needles
that
covered
it
on
either
side
stood
great
towering
pines
and
on
the
yellow
moss
under
the
trees
sunbeams
were
playing
here
it
was
so
lovely
and
so
peaceful
that
she
almost
forgot
her
fears
of
a
sudden
she
caught
sight
of
an
old
woman
moving
about
in
among
the
trees
it
was
she
who
was
famed
as
a
witch
how
dreadful
that
that
wicked
old
woman
is
still
alive
thought
gertrude
and
that
i
should
come
upon
her
here
in
the
forest
she
tried
to
slip
along
very
cautiously
so
as
not
to
be
seen
by
the
witch
but
before
gertrude
could
get
past
the
old
woman
looked
up
hi
there
the
old
woman
shouted
wait
a
bit
and
you
see
something
in
a
twinkling
was
in
the
road
and
on
her
knees
almost
in
front
of
gertrude
then
with
her
forefinger
she
drew
a
circle
in
the
carpet
of
fir
needles
at
the
centre
of
which
she
placed
a
shallow
brass
bowl
now
she
going
to
do
some
conjuring
thought
gertrude
why
then
it
must
be
true
that
she
is
a
witch
look
down
into
the
bowl
said
and
maybe
see
something
when
gertrude
glanced
down
she
gave
a
start
mirrored
in
the
bowl
she
saw
plainly
the
face
of
ingmar
immediately
the
old
woman
handed
her
a
long
needle
see
here
she
said
take
this
and
pierce
his
eyes
do
this
to
him
because
he
has
played
you
false
gertrude
hesitated
a
little
but
felt
strongly
tempted
why
should
he
fare
well
and
be
rich
and
happy
while
you
suffer
said
the
old
dame
with
that
gertrude
was
seized
by
an
uncontrollable
desire
to
do
the
ogre
bidding
and
lowered
the
needle
mind
you
stick
him
right
in
the
eye
said
the
witch
whereupon
gertrude
quickly
drove
the
needle
first
into
one
and
then
into
the
other
of
ingmar
eyes
in
so
doing
she
noticed
that
the
needle
went
far
as
though
it
had
come
into
contact
with
metal
but
rather
as
if
it
had
penetrated
some
soft
substance
when
she
drew
it
out
there
was
blood
on
it
gertrude
seeing
blood
on
the
needle
thought
she
had
really
put
out
ingmar
eyes
then
she
was
so
overcome
by
remorse
for
what
she
had
done
and
so
frightened
that
she
woke
up
she
lay
for
a
long
while
trembling
and
weeping
before
she
was
able
to
convince
herself
that
it
was
only
a
dream
may
god
preserve
me
from
any
thought
of
vengeance
she
moaned
she
had
barely
quieted
down
and
dropped
off
to
sleep
again
when
the
dream
recurred
once
more
she
wandered
along
the
narrow
paths
toward
the
grazing
ground
this
time
too
the
cows
had
strayed
and
she
went
into
the
forest
to
look
for
them
again
she
came
to
the
beautiful
road
and
saw
the
sunbeams
playing
on
the
moss
then
she
suddenly
recalled
all
that
had
just
happened
to
her
in
a
dream
and
grew
terribly
frightened
lest
she
should
meet
the
old
witch
again
seeing
nothing
of
her
she
felt
greatly
relieved
all
at
once
she
seemed
to
see
the
earth
between
a
couple
of
moss
tufts
open
suddenly
a
head
appeared
then
she
saw
the
body
of
a
tiny
little
man
work
its
way
up
out
of
the
earth
and
all
the
while
the
little
man
was
making
a
buzzing
and
humming
noise
by
that
she
knew
whom
she
had
encountered
it
was
humming
pete
of
course
who
was
said
to
be
a
bit
queer
in
his
head
sometimes
he
used
to
stay
down
in
the
village
but
during
the
summer
he
always
lived
in
a
mud
cave
in
the
forest
then
gertrude
recalled
to
memory
what
she
had
heard
folks
say
of
pete
any
one
wanting
to
injure
an
enemy
without
risking
discovery
could
avail
himself
of
his
services
he
was
suspected
of
having
started
a
number
of
incendiary
fires
at
the
instigation
of
others
gertrude
then
went
up
to
the
man
and
asked
him
half
in
fun
if
he
would
like
to
set
fire
to
the
ingmar
farm
she
wished
it
done
she
said
because
ingmar
ingmarsson
thought
more
of
the
farm
than
of
her
to
her
horror
the
dwarf
was
ready
to
act
on
her
suggestion
nodding
gleefully
he
started
on
a
run
toward
the
settlement
she
hurried
after
but
could
not
seem
to
overtake
him
her
dress
caught
in
the
brushwood
her
feet
sank
in
the
marsh
and
she
stumbled
over
stony
ground
when
she
was
almost
out
of
the
forest
what
should
she
see
through
the
trees
but
the
glow
from
a
fire
he
has
done
it
he
has
set
fire
to
the
farm
she
shrieked
again
awakening
from
the
horror
of
the
dream
now
gertrude
sat
up
in
bed
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
she
dared
not
sink
back
on
her
pillow
again
for
fear
of
dreaming
further
oh
lord
help
me
lord
help
me
she
cried
i
do
know
how
much
evil
there
may
be
hidden
in
my
heart
but
god
knows
that
never
once
during
all
this
time
have
i
thought
of
revenging
myself
on
ingmar
o
god
let
me
not
fall
into
this
sin
she
prayed
wringing
her
hands
in
an
agony
of
despair
she
cried
out
grief
is
a
menace
grief
is
a
menace
grief
is
a
menace
it
was
not
very
clear
to
her
just
what
she
meant
by
that
but
she
felt
somehow
that
her
poor
heart
was
like
a
ravaged
garden
in
which
all
the
flowers
had
been
uprooted
and
now
grief
as
a
gardener
moved
about
in
there
planting
thistles
and
poisonous
herbs
the
whole
forenoon
of
the
following
day
gertrude
thought
that
she
was
still
dreaming
her
dream
had
seemed
so
real
that
she
could
not
get
it
out
of
her
mind
remembering
with
what
satisfaction
she
had
plunged
the
needle
into
ingmar
eyes
she
shuddered
how
dreadful
that
i
should
have
become
so
cruel
and
resentful
what
shall
i
do
to
rid
myself
of
this
i
really
getting
to
be
a
very
wicked
person
after
dinner
gertrude
went
out
to
milk
the
cows
she
drew
her
kerchief
down
over
her
face
as
usual
and
kept
her
eyes
on
the
ground
walking
along
the
narrow
paths
where
she
had
wandered
in
the
dream
even
the
flowers
by
the
wayside
looked
the
same
as
in
the
dream
in
her
strange
state
of
she
could
hardly
distinguish
between
what
she
actually
saw
and
what
she
only
seemed
to
see
in
fancy
when
she
reached
the
pasturage
there
were
no
cows
to
be
seen
and
she
began
to
search
for
them
as
she
had
done
in
the
dream
looking
down
by
the
brook
under
the
birches
and
behind
the
brushwood
she
could
not
find
them
yet
she
felt
quite
certain
that
they
must
be
thereabout
and
that
she
would
probably
see
them
were
she
only
wide
awake
presently
she
came
upon
an
opening
in
the
hedge
and
knew
at
once
that
the
cows
had
made
their
escape
through
this
gertrude
straightway
started
in
search
of
the
strayed
cattle
following
the
track
which
their
hoofs
had
made
in
the
soft
earth
of
the
forest
it
was
plain
that
they
had
turned
in
on
a
road
leading
to
a
remote
säter
ah
she
said
now
i
know
where
they
are
i
remember
that
the
folks
down
at
luck
farm
were
going
to
drive
their
cattle
to
the
säter
this
morning
our
cows
on
hearing
the
tinkle
of
their
cowbells
must
have
broken
loose
and
followed
the
others
gertrude
anxiety
had
for
the
moment
made
her
wide
awake
so
she
determined
to
go
up
to
the
säter
and
fetch
the
cows
herself
otherwise
there
was
no
telling
when
they
would
come
back
now
she
walked
briskly
along
the
steep
and
rocky
road
after
going
uphill
for
a
time
there
was
an
abrupt
turn
in
the
road
and
she
suddenly
came
upon
smooth
and
even
ground
that
was
thick
with
pine
needles
she
recognized
it
as
the
road
of
her
dream
there
stood
the
selfsame
towering
pines
and
on
the
moss
were
the
selfsame
yellow
sun
spots
at
sight
of
the
road
gertrude
lapsed
into
the
dreamy
state
in
which
she
had
been
most
of
the
day
she
moved
along
half
expecting
that
something
wonderful
would
happen
to
her
she
looked
under
the
fir
trees
to
see
if
any
of
the
mysterious
beings
who
wander
about
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
would
suddenly
appear
to
her
however
none
appeared
but
in
her
mind
new
thoughts
were
awakened
what
if
i
should
really
take
revenge
on
ingmar
would
that
still
my
fears
would
i
then
escape
the
horrors
of
insanity
if
he
were
to
suffer
what
i
am
suffering
would
that
be
any
relief
to
me
the
beautiful
road
seemed
interminably
long
she
walked
there
a
whole
hour
astonished
that
nothing
unusual
had
happened
the
road
finally
ended
in
a
forest
meadow
it
was
a
lovely
spot
covered
with
fresh
green
grass
and
many
wild
flowers
on
one
side
rose
a
steep
mountain
the
other
sides
were
covered
with
high
trees
mostly
mountain
ash
with
thick
clusters
of
white
blossoms
and
here
and
there
was
a
group
of
birches
and
alders
a
rather
broad
stream
gushed
down
the
mountainside
and
wound
its
way
through
the
meadow
then
went
hurling
down
into
a
gap
that
was
covered
with
dwarfed
trees
and
bushes
gertrude
stood
stock
still
she
knew
the
place
at
once
that
stream
was
blackwater
brook
and
strange
tales
were
told
of
it
sometimes
when
crossing
this
stream
people
had
clear
visions
of
events
that
were
taking
place
elsewhere
a
little
lad
in
crossing
once
saw
a
bridal
procession
which
happened
just
then
to
be
moving
toward
the
church
far
down
in
the
village
and
a
charcoal
burner
once
saw
a
king
with
crown
and
sceptre
ride
to
his
coronation
gertrude
heart
was
in
her
mouth
god
have
mercy
on
me
for
what
i
may
see
here
she
gasped
half
tempted
to
turn
back
poor
little
me
she
wailed
feeling
sorry
for
herself
but
i
must
i
must
cross
here
to
fetch
my
cows
dear
lord
do
let
me
see
anything
dreadful
or
bad
she
prayed
her
hands
tightly
clasped
and
shaking
from
fright
and
do
let
me
fall
into
temptation
there
was
no
doubt
in
her
mind
that
she
would
see
something
she
was
so
sure
of
it
in
fact
that
she
hardly
dared
venture
out
upon
the
stones
that
led
across
the
brook
yet
something
made
her
do
it
when
halfway
over
all
at
once
she
saw
something
moving
in
among
the
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
brook
it
was
no
bridal
procession
however
but
a
solitary
man
who
was
slowly
coming
toward
the
meadow
the
man
was
tall
and
young
and
was
dressed
in
a
long
black
garment
that
came
to
his
feet
his
head
was
uncovered
and
his
hair
hung
in
long
black
locks
over
his
shoulders
he
had
a
slender
and
very
beautiful
face
he
was
coming
straight
toward
gertrude
in
his
eyes
which
were
clear
and
radiant
there
was
a
wonderful
light
and
when
his
gaze
fell
upon
gertrude
she
felt
that
he
could
read
all
her
sorrowful
thoughts
and
she
saw
that
he
pitied
her
whose
mind
was
haunted
by
fears
of
the
paltry
things
of
earth
whose
soul
had
become
darkened
by
thoughts
of
revenge
and
whose
heart
had
been
sown
with
the
thistles
and
poison
flowers
of
grief
as
he
drew
nigh
there
came
over
gertrude
such
a
blissful
sense
of
ever
growing
peace
and
serenity
and
when
he
had
passed
by
there
was
no
longer
any
fear
or
resentment
in
her
thought
all
that
was
not
good
had
vanished
like
a
sickness
of
which
one
has
been
healed
gertrude
stood
rapt
for
a
long
while
the
vision
faded
away
but
she
was
still
held
by
the
beauty
of
it
and
the
impression
of
what
she
had
seen
stayed
with
her
clasping
her
hands
she
raised
them
in
ecstasy
i
have
seen
the
christ
she
cried
out
with
joy
i
have
seen
the
christ
he
has
freed
me
from
my
sorrow
and
i
love
him
now
i
can
never
again
love
anyone
else
in
the
world
the
trials
of
life
had
suddenly
dwindled
into
mere
nothings
and
life
long
years
appeared
as
but
a
moment
in
the
glass
of
time
while
earthly
joys
seemed
trivial
and
shallow
and
meaningless
all
at
once
it
became
clear
to
gertrude
how
she
was
to
order
her
life
so
that
she
might
never
again
sink
down
into
the
darkness
of
fear
nor
be
tempted
into
doing
anything
mean
or
hateful
she
would
go
with
the
hellgumists
to
jerusalem
this
thought
had
come
to
her
when
the
christ
passed
by
she
felt
that
it
had
come
from
him
she
had
read
it
in
his
eyes
on
the
beautiful
june
day
when
the
daughter
of
berger
sven
persson
was
given
in
marriage
to
ingmar
ingmarsson
a
tall
slender
young
woman
stopped
at
the
ingmar
farm
early
in
the
morning
and
asked
if
she
might
speak
to
the
bridegroom
she
wore
her
kerchief
so
far
down
over
her
face
that
nothing
could
be
seen
of
it
save
a
creamy
cheek
and
a
pair
of
rosy
lips
on
her
arm
was
a
basket
that
held
little
bundles
of
handmade
trimmings
a
few
hair
chains
and
hair
bracelets
she
gave
her
message
to
an
old
maidservant
whom
she
met
in
the
yard
and
who
went
in
and
told
the
housewife
the
housewife
answered
sharply
go
straight
back
and
tell
her
that
ingmar
ingmarsson
is
just
going
to
drive
to
church
he
has
no
time
to
talk
with
her
as
soon
as
the
young
woman
received
this
curt
dismissal
she
went
her
way
when
the
bridal
party
had
returned
from
the
church
she
came
back
and
again
asked
if
she
might
speak
to
ingmar
ingmarsson
this
time
she
approached
one
of
the
menservants
who
was
hanging
round
the
stable
door
he
went
in
and
told
the
master
tell
her
that
ingmar
ingmarsson
is
about
to
sit
down
to
the
wedding
feast
said
the
master
he
has
no
time
to
talk
to
her
on
receiving
this
answer
she
sighed
and
went
her
way
when
she
came
again
it
was
late
in
the
evening
as
the
sun
was
setting
this
time
she
gave
her
message
to
a
child
that
was
swinging
on
the
gate
the
child
ran
straight
to
the
house
and
told
the
bride
tell
her
that
ingmar
ingmarsson
is
dancing
with
his
wife
said
the
bride
he
has
no
time
to
talk
to
anyone
else
when
the
child
came
back
and
repeated
what
had
been
told
her
the
young
woman
smiled
indulgently
and
said
now
you
are
telling
something
that
is
true
ingmar
ingmarsson
is
not
dancing
with
his
bride
this
time
she
did
not
go
away
but
remained
standing
at
the
gate
the
bride
meanwhile
thought
to
herself
i
have
told
a
lie
on
my
wedding
day
sorry
for
what
she
had
done
she
went
up
to
ingmar
and
told
him
that
there
was
a
stranger
outside
who
wished
to
speak
with
him
ingmar
went
out
and
found
gertrude
standing
at
the
gate
waiting
when
gertrude
saw
him
coming
she
started
down
the
road
ingmar
following
they
walked
along
in
silence
till
they
were
some
distance
away
from
the
house
as
to
ingmar
it
could
be
truthfully
said
of
him
that
he
had
aged
in
the
short
time
of
a
few
weeks
at
any
rate
there
was
something
about
his
face
that
showed
added
shrewdness
and
caution
he
also
stooped
more
and
looked
more
subdued
now
that
he
had
acquired
riches
than
was
the
case
when
he
had
nothing
indeed
he
was
anything
but
glad
to
see
gertrude
every
day
since
the
auction
he
had
been
trying
to
persuade
himself
into
the
belief
that
he
was
satisfied
with
his
bargain
in
fact
we
ingmarssons
care
for
little
else
than
to
plow
and
to
sow
the
fields
on
the
ingmar
farm
was
what
he
had
said
to
himself
but
there
was
something
that
troubled
him
even
more
than
the
loss
of
gertrude
the
thought
that
now
there
was
one
human
being
who
could
say
of
him
that
he
had
not
lived
up
to
his
word
keeping
a
little
behind
gertrude
all
the
while
he
went
over
in
his
mind
all
the
scornful
things
which
she
had
a
right
to
say
to
him
presently
gertrude
sat
down
on
a
stone
at
the
roadside
and
put
her
basket
on
the
ground
then
she
drew
her
kerchief
still
farther
over
her
face
sit
down
she
said
to
ingmar
pointing
to
another
stone
i
have
many
things
to
talk
over
with
you
ingmar
sat
down
and
was
glad
that
he
felt
quite
calm
this
will
be
easier
than
i
had
expected
he
said
to
himself
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
much
harder
on
me
to
see
gertrude
again
and
to
hear
her
speak
i
was
afraid
that
my
love
for
her
would
get
the
better
of
me
i
should
never
have
come
like
this
and
disturbed
you
on
your
wedding
day
had
i
not
been
compelled
to
do
so
said
gertrude
i
shall
soon
be
leaving
this
part
of
the
world
never
to
return
i
was
ready
to
start
a
week
ago
when
something
came
up
that
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
put
off
going
that
i
might
speak
with
you
ingmar
sat
all
huddled
up
with
his
shoulders
hunched
and
his
head
drawn
in
as
if
he
were
expecting
a
tempest
saying
to
himself
meanwhile
whatever
gertrude
may
think
about
it
i
sure
i
did
the
right
thing
in
choosing
the
farm
i
should
have
been
lost
without
it
ingmar
said
gertrude
blushing
so
that
the
little
corner
of
her
cheek
that
could
be
seen
behind
the
kerchief
showed
crimson
you
remember
of
course
that
five
years
ago
i
was
ready
to
join
the
hellgumists
at
that
time
i
had
given
my
heart
to
christ
but
i
took
it
back
to
give
it
to
you
in
so
doing
i
acted
wrongly
and
that
why
i
had
to
suffer
all
this
as
i
once
forsook
christ
even
so
have
i
been
forsaken
by
the
one
i
loved
when
ingmar
perceived
that
gertrude
was
about
to
tell
him
that
she
was
going
with
the
hellgumists
he
at
once
showed
signs
of
disapproval
i
ca
bear
to
have
her
join
these
jerusalem
people
and
go
away
to
a
strange
land
he
thought
and
he
opposed
her
plan
as
vehemently
as
he
would
have
done
had
he
still
been
engaged
to
her
you
must
think
like
that
gertrude
he
protested
god
never
meant
this
as
a
punishment
to
you
no
no
ingmar
not
as
a
punishment
indeed
not
but
only
to
show
me
how
badly
i
had
chosen
the
second
time
ah
this
is
no
punishment
i
feel
so
happy
and
lack
for
nothing
all
my
sorrow
has
been
turned
into
joy
you
will
understand
this
ingmar
when
i
tell
you
that
the
lord
himself
has
chosen
me
and
called
me
ingmar
was
silent
a
look
of
weariness
came
into
his
eyes
be
a
fool
he
said
to
himself
let
gertrude
go
to
put
sea
and
land
between
you
and
her
would
be
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
sea
and
land
yes
sea
and
land
and
yet
that
something
within
him
which
did
not
want
to
let
gertrude
go
was
nevertheless
stronger
than
himself
so
he
said
i
ca
conceive
of
your
parents
allowing
you
to
leave
them
that
they
never
do
gertrude
replied
and
i
know
it
so
well
that
i
would
even
dare
ask
them
father
would
never
give
his
consent
he
would
use
force
if
necessary
to
prevent
my
going
the
hard
part
of
it
is
that
i
shall
have
to
sneak
away
they
think
now
that
i
going
about
the
country
selling
my
handiwork
so
they
wo
know
about
it
until
i
have
joined
the
jerusalem
pilgrims
at
gothenburg
and
am
well
out
of
sweden
ingmar
was
very
much
distressed
to
think
that
gertrude
would
be
willing
to
cause
her
parents
such
heavy
sorrow
can
it
be
that
she
realizes
how
badly
she
is
behaving
he
wondered
he
was
about
to
remonstrate
with
her
then
checked
himself
you
hardly
the
proper
person
to
reproach
gertrude
for
anything
that
she
may
do
he
remarked
to
himself
indeed
i
know
it
will
be
hard
on
father
and
mother
said
gertrude
but
i
must
follow
jesus
and
she
smiled
as
she
named
the
name
of
the
saviour
he
has
saved
me
from
destruction
he
has
healed
my
sick
soul
she
said
feelingly
and
as
if
she
had
only
now
found
courage
to
do
so
she
pushed
back
her
kerchief
and
looked
ingmar
straight
in
the
eyes
it
struck
ingmar
that
she
was
drawing
comparisons
between
him
and
some
one
whose
image
she
carried
in
her
heart
and
he
felt
that
she
found
him
small
and
insignificant
it
will
be
very
hard
for
father
and
mother
she
reiterated
father
is
an
old
man
now
and
must
soon
give
up
his
school
so
they
will
have
even
less
to
live
upon
than
before
when
he
has
no
work
to
take
up
his
mind
he
will
become
restless
and
irritable
mother
wo
have
an
easy
time
with
him
they
be
very
unhappy
both
of
them
of
course
it
would
have
been
quite
different
could
i
have
stayed
at
home
to
cheer
them
gertrude
paused
as
if
afraid
to
come
out
with
what
she
wanted
to
say
ingmar
throat
tightened
and
his
eyes
began
to
fill
he
divined
that
gertrude
wanted
to
ask
him
to
look
after
her
old
parents
and
i
fancied
that
she
had
come
here
only
to
abuse
and
threaten
me
and
instead
she
opens
her
heart
to
me
you
wo
have
to
ask
me
gertrude
he
said
this
is
a
great
honour
for
you
to
confer
upon
one
who
has
behaved
so
badly
to
you
be
assured
that
i
shall
treat
your
old
parents
better
than
i
have
treated
you
when
ingmar
said
this
his
voice
trembled
and
the
wary
look
was
gone
from
his
face
how
kind
gertrude
is
to
me
he
thought
she
does
not
ask
this
of
me
only
out
of
consideration
for
her
parents
but
she
wants
to
show
me
that
she
has
forgiven
me
i
knew
ingmar
that
you
would
say
no
to
this
and
i
have
something
more
to
tell
you
she
spoke
now
in
a
brighter
and
more
confident
tone
i
got
a
great
surprise
for
you
how
charmingly
gertrude
speaks
ingmar
was
thinking
she
has
the
sweetest
the
cheeriest
and
most
tuneful
voice
i
have
ever
heard
about
a
week
ago
gertrude
continued
i
left
home
intending
to
go
straight
on
to
gothenburg
so
as
to
be
there
when
the
hellgumists
arrive
the
first
night
i
stopped
over
at
bergsåna
with
a
poor
widow
whose
name
it
marie
boving
that
name
i
want
you
to
remember
ingmar
if
she
should
ever
come
to
want
you
must
help
her
how
pretty
gertrude
is
he
thought
as
he
nodded
and
promised
to
remember
marie
boving
name
how
pretty
she
is
what
will
become
of
me
when
she
goes
god
forgive
me
if
i
did
wrong
in
giving
her
up
for
an
old
farm
fields
and
meadows
can
never
be
the
same
to
you
as
a
human
being
they
ca
laugh
with
you
when
you
happy
nor
comfort
you
when
you
sad
nothing
on
earth
can
make
up
for
the
loss
of
one
who
has
loved
you
marie
boving
gertrude
went
on
has
a
little
room
off
her
kitchen
which
she
let
me
have
for
the
night
surely
sleep
well
she
said
to
me
you
are
to
lie
on
the
bedding
which
i
bought
at
the
sale
on
the
ingmar
farm
but
as
soon
as
i
laid
down
i
felt
a
hard
lump
in
the
pillow
under
my
head
after
all
it
was
such
extra
good
bedding
marie
had
bought
for
herself
i
thought
but
i
was
so
tired
out
from
tramping
around
all
day
that
i
finally
dropped
off
to
sleep
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
awoke
and
turned
the
pillow
so
i
should
feel
that
hard
lump
while
smoothing
out
the
pillow
i
discovered
that
the
ticking
had
been
cut
and
clumsily
basted
together
inside
there
was
something
hard
that
crackled
like
paper
do
have
to
lie
on
rocks
i
said
to
myself
then
i
ripped
open
a
corner
of
the
pillow
and
pulled
out
a
small
parcel
which
was
done
up
in
wrapping
paper
and
tied
with
string
gertrude
paused
and
glanced
at
ingmar
to
see
whether
his
curiosity
was
aroused
but
apparently
he
had
not
listened
very
closely
to
what
she
was
telling
how
prettily
gertrude
uses
her
hands
when
she
talks
he
thought
i
do
think
i
ever
seen
any
one
as
graceful
as
she
is
there
an
old
saying
that
man
loves
mankind
above
everything
however
i
believe
that
i
did
the
right
thing
for
it
was
only
the
farm
that
needed
me
but
the
whole
parish
just
the
same
he
felt
to
his
discomfort
that
now
it
was
not
so
easy
to
persuade
himself
that
he
loved
his
old
home
more
than
he
loved
gertrude
i
put
the
parcel
down
beside
the
bed
thinking
that
in
the
morning
i
would
give
it
to
marie
but
at
daybreak
i
saw
that
your
name
was
written
on
the
wrapper
on
closer
examination
i
decided
to
take
it
along
and
turn
it
over
to
you
without
saying
anything
about
it
either
to
marie
or
to
any
one
else
then
taking
a
little
parcel
from
the
bottom
of
her
basket
she
said
here
it
is
ingmar
take
it
it
your
property
she
supposed
of
course
that
he
would
be
happily
surprised
ingmar
took
the
parcel
without
much
thought
as
to
what
he
was
receiving
he
was
struggling
to
ward
off
the
bitter
regrets
that
were
stealing
in
on
him
if
gertrude
only
knew
how
bewitching
she
is
when
she
so
sweet
and
gentle
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
had
she
come
to
upbraid
me
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
glad
that
she
is
as
she
is
he
thought
but
i
not
it
seems
as
if
she
were
grateful
to
me
for
having
failed
her
ingmar
said
gertrude
in
a
tone
that
finally
made
him
understand
that
she
had
something
very
important
to
tell
him
when
elof
lay
sick
at
the
ingmar
farm
he
must
have
used
that
very
pillow
she
took
the
parcel
from
ingmar
and
opened
it
then
she
counted
out
twenty
crisp
new
bank
notes
each
of
which
was
a
bill
holding
the
money
in
front
of
his
eyes
she
said
look
ingmar
here
every
krona
of
your
inheritance
money
it
was
elof
of
course
who
hid
it
in
the
pillow
ingmar
heard
what
she
said
and
he
saw
the
bank
notes
but
he
saw
and
heard
as
in
a
daze
gertrude
placed
the
money
in
his
hand
but
his
fingers
would
not
close
over
it
and
it
fell
to
the
ground
then
gertrude
picked
it
up
and
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket
ingmar
stood
there
reeling
like
a
drunken
man
suddenly
he
raised
his
arm
clenched
his
fist
tight
and
shook
it
just
as
a
drunken
man
might
have
done
my
god
my
god
he
groaned
indeed
he
wished
that
he
could
have
had
a
word
with
our
lord
could
have
asked
him
why
this
money
had
not
been
found
sooner
and
why
it
should
have
turned
up
now
when
it
was
not
needed
and
when
gertrude
was
already
lost
to
him
the
next
moment
his
hand
dropped
heavily
on
gertrude
shoulder
you
certainly
know
how
to
take
your
revenge
do
you
call
this
revenge
ingmar
asked
gertrude
in
dismay
what
else
should
i
call
it
why
did
you
bring
me
this
money
at
once
i
wanted
to
wait
until
the
day
of
your
wedding
if
you
had
only
come
before
i
sure
i
could
have
bought
back
the
farm
from
berger
sven
persson
and
then
i
would
have
married
you
yes
i
knew
that
and
yet
you
come
on
my
wedding
day
when
it
too
late
it
would
have
been
too
late
in
any
case
ingmar
it
was
too
late
a
week
ago
it
is
too
late
now
and
it
will
be
too
late
forever
ingmar
had
again
sunk
down
on
the
stone
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
wailed
and
i
thought
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
believed
that
no
power
on
earth
could
have
altered
this
but
now
i
find
that
there
was
a
way
out
that
we
might
all
have
been
happy
understand
one
thing
ingmar
when
i
found
the
money
i
knew
at
once
that
it
would
be
the
kind
of
help
to
us
that
you
say
but
it
was
no
temptation
to
me
no
not
for
a
second
for
i
belong
to
another
you
should
have
kept
it
yourself
cried
ingmar
i
feel
as
if
a
wolf
were
gnawing
at
my
heart
so
long
as
i
believed
there
was
no
other
course
open
to
me
it
was
so
bad
but
now
that
i
know
you
could
have
been
mine
i
ca
why
ingmar
i
came
here
to
bring
you
happiness
meanwhile
the
folks
at
the
house
had
become
impatient
and
had
gone
out
on
the
porch
where
they
were
calling
ingmar
ingmar
yes
and
there
the
bride
too
waiting
for
me
he
said
mournfully
and
to
think
that
you
gertrude
should
have
brought
all
this
about
when
i
had
to
give
you
up
circumstances
forced
me
to
do
so
while
you
have
spoiled
everything
simply
to
make
me
unhappy
now
i
know
how
my
father
felt
when
my
mother
killed
the
child
then
he
broke
into
violent
sobs
never
have
i
felt
toward
you
as
i
do
now
he
cried
passionately
i
never
loved
you
half
so
much
as
i
do
now
little
did
i
think
that
love
could
be
so
cruelly
bitter
gertrude
gently
placed
her
hand
on
his
head
ingmar
she
said
very
quietly
it
was
never
never
my
meaning
to
take
revenge
on
you
but
so
long
as
your
heart
is
wedded
to
the
things
of
this
earth
it
is
wedded
to
sorrow
for
a
long
while
ingmar
sat
motionless
his
head
bowed
when
he
at
last
looked
up
gertrude
was
gone
people
now
came
running
from
the
farm
to
find
him
he
struck
his
clenched
fist
against
the
stone
upon
which
he
sat
and
a
look
of
determination
came
into
his
face
gertrude
and
i
will
surely
meet
again
he
said
then
maybe
it
will
be
altogether
different
we
ingmarssons
are
known
to
win
what
we
yearn
for
the
dean
widow
everybody
tried
to
dissuade
the
hellgumists
from
going
to
jerusalem
and
toward
the
last
it
seemed
as
though
the
very
hills
and
vales
echoed
the
plea
do
not
go
do
not
go
even
the
country
gentlemen
did
their
best
to
get
the
peasants
to
abandon
the
idea
the
bailiff
the
judge
and
the
councilmen
gave
them
no
peace
they
asked
them
how
they
could
feel
sure
that
these
americans
were
not
imposters
for
they
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
sort
of
folk
they
would
be
getting
in
with
in
that
far
eastern
country
there
was
neither
law
nor
order
there
one
was
always
in
danger
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
brigands
besides
there
were
no
decent
roads
in
that
land
all
their
goods
would
have
to
be
transported
by
means
of
as
in
the
wild
forests
up
north
the
doctor
told
them
they
would
never
be
able
to
stand
the
climate
that
jerusalem
was
full
of
smallpox
and
malignant
fevers
they
were
going
away
only
to
die
the
hellgumists
answered
that
they
knew
all
this
and
it
was
for
that
very
reason
they
were
going
they
were
going
there
in
order
to
fight
the
smallpox
and
the
fevers
to
build
roads
and
to
till
the
soil
god
country
should
no
longer
lie
waste
they
would
transform
it
into
a
paradise
and
no
one
was
able
to
turn
them
from
their
purpose
down
in
the
village
lived
an
old
lady
the
widow
of
the
dean
she
was
very
very
old
she
occupied
a
large
chamber
above
the
post
office
just
across
the
street
from
the
church
where
she
had
lived
since
the
death
of
her
husband
some
of
the
more
peasant
women
had
always
made
it
a
rule
to
drop
in
to
see
the
old
lady
on
sundays
before
the
service
and
bring
her
some
freshly
baked
bread
a
pat
of
butter
or
a
can
of
milk
on
these
occasions
she
would
always
have
the
coffee
pot
put
on
the
fire
the
moment
they
came
in
and
the
one
who
could
shout
the
loudest
always
talked
with
her
for
she
was
frightfully
deaf
of
course
they
would
try
to
tell
her
about
everything
that
had
happened
during
the
week
but
they
could
never
be
certain
as
to
how
much
she
heard
of
what
was
told
her
she
never
left
her
room
and
there
were
times
when
it
seemed
as
if
people
had
forgotten
her
entirely
then
some
one
in
passing
would
see
her
old
face
back
of
the
draped
white
curtains
at
the
window
and
think
i
must
not
forget
her
in
her
loneliness
when
we
have
killed
the
calf
i
run
in
to
see
her
and
take
her
a
bit
of
fresh
meat
no
one
could
find
out
just
how
much
she
knew
or
did
not
know
of
what
went
on
in
the
parish
with
the
advancing
years
she
became
more
and
more
detached
and
apparently
lost
all
interest
in
the
things
of
this
world
now
she
just
sat
reading
all
the
while
in
an
old
postil
which
she
seemed
to
know
by
heart
living
with
her
was
a
faithful
old
servant
who
helped
her
dress
and
prepared
her
meals
the
two
of
them
were
in
mortal
fear
of
robbers
and
mice
and
they
were
so
afraid
of
fire
that
they
would
sit
in
the
dark
the
whole
evening
rather
than
light
the
lamp
several
among
those
who
had
lately
become
followers
of
hellgum
used
to
call
on
the
dean
widow
in
the
old
days
and
bring
her
little
gifts
but
since
their
conversion
they
had
separated
themselves
from
all
who
were
not
of
their
faith
so
they
no
longer
went
to
see
her
no
one
knew
whether
she
understood
why
they
did
not
come
nor
did
anybody
know
whether
she
had
heard
anything
about
their
proposed
emigration
to
jerusalem
but
one
day
the
old
lady
took
it
into
her
head
to
go
for
a
drive
and
ordered
the
servant
to
get
her
a
carriage
and
pair
imagine
the
astonishment
of
the
old
servant
but
when
she
attempted
to
remonstrate
the
old
lady
suddenly
became
stone
deaf
raising
her
right
hand
her
forefinger
poised
in
the
air
she
said
i
wish
to
go
for
a
drive
sara
lena
you
must
find
me
a
carriage
and
a
pair
of
horses
there
was
nothing
for
sara
lena
but
to
do
as
she
was
told
so
she
went
over
to
the
pastor
to
ask
for
the
loan
of
his
rig
which
was
a
fairly
turnout
that
done
she
was
put
to
the
bother
of
airing
and
brushing
an
old
fur
cape
and
an
old
velvet
bonnet
that
had
been
lying
in
camphor
twenty
consecutive
years
and
it
was
no
small
task
getting
the
old
lady
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
wagon
she
was
so
feeble
that
it
seemed
as
if
her
life
could
have
been
as
easily
snuffed
out
as
a
candle
flame
in
a
storm
when
the
dean
widow
was
at
last
safely
seated
in
the
carriage
she
ordered
the
driver
to
take
her
to
the
ingmar
farm
maybe
the
folks
up
at
the
farm
were
not
surprised
when
they
saw
who
was
coming
the
housefolk
came
running
out
and
lifted
her
down
from
the
carriage
and
ushered
her
into
the
seated
at
the
table
in
there
were
quite
a
number
of
hellgumists
of
late
they
had
been
in
the
habit
of
coming
together
and
having
their
frugal
meals
in
common
meals
which
consisted
of
rice
and
tea
and
other
light
things
this
was
to
prepare
them
for
the
coming
journey
across
the
desert
the
dean
widow
glanced
around
the
room
several
persons
tried
to
speak
to
her
but
that
day
she
heard
nothing
whatever
suddenly
she
put
up
her
hand
and
said
in
that
hard
dry
voice
in
which
deaf
people
are
wont
to
speak
you
do
not
come
to
see
any
more
therefore
i
have
come
to
to
warn
you
not
to
go
to
jerusalem
it
is
a
wicked
city
it
was
there
they
crucified
our
saviour
karin
attempted
to
answer
the
old
lady
who
apparently
did
not
hear
for
she
went
right
on
it
is
a
wicked
city
she
repeated
bad
people
live
there
was
there
they
crucified
christ
i
have
come
here
she
added
because
this
has
been
a
good
house
ingmarsson
has
been
a
good
name
it
has
always
been
a
good
name
therefore
you
must
remain
in
our
parish
then
she
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
house
now
she
had
done
her
part
and
could
die
in
peace
this
was
the
last
service
that
life
demanded
of
her
after
the
old
lady
had
gone
karin
broke
into
tears
perhaps
it
is
right
for
us
to
go
she
sighed
but
she
was
pleased
that
the
dean
widow
had
said
that
ingmarsson
was
a
good
name
that
it
had
always
been
a
good
name
it
was
the
first
and
only
time
karin
had
been
known
to
waver
or
to
express
any
doubt
as
to
the
advisability
of
the
great
undertaking
the
departure
of
the
pilgrims
one
beautiful
morning
in
july
a
long
train
of
carts
and
wagons
set
out
from
the
ingmar
farm
the
hellgumists
had
at
last
completed
their
arrangements
and
were
now
leaving
for
jerusalem
the
first
stage
of
their
journey
being
the
long
drive
to
the
railway
station
the
procession
in
moving
toward
the
village
had
to
pass
a
wretched
hovel
which
was
called
mucklemire
the
people
who
lived
there
were
a
disreputable
lot
the
kind
of
scum
of
the
earth
which
must
have
sprung
into
being
when
our
lord
eyes
were
turned
or
when
he
had
been
busy
elsewhere
there
was
a
whole
horde
of
dirty
ragged
youngsters
on
the
place
who
were
in
the
habit
of
running
loose
all
day
shrieking
after
passing
vehicles
and
calling
the
occupants
bad
names
there
was
an
old
crone
who
usually
sat
by
the
roadside
tipsy
and
there
were
a
husband
and
wife
who
were
always
quarrelling
and
fighting
and
who
had
never
been
known
to
do
any
honest
work
no
one
could
say
whether
they
begged
more
than
they
stole
or
stole
more
than
they
begged
when
the
came
alongside
this
wretched
hovel
which
was
about
as
tumbledown
as
a
place
can
become
where
wind
and
storm
have
for
many
years
been
allowed
to
work
havoc
they
saw
the
old
crone
standing
erect
and
sober
at
the
roadside
on
the
same
spot
where
she
usually
sat
in
a
drunken
stupor
lurching
to
and
fro
and
babbling
incoherently
and
with
her
were
four
of
the
children
all
five
were
now
washed
and
combed
and
as
decently
dressed
as
was
possible
for
them
to
be
when
the
persons
seated
in
the
first
cart
caught
sight
of
them
they
slackened
their
speed
and
drove
by
very
slowly
the
others
did
likewise
walking
their
horses
all
the
suddenly
burst
into
tears
the
crying
softly
while
the
children
broke
into
loud
sobs
and
wails
nothing
had
so
moved
them
as
the
sight
of
beggar
lina
standing
at
the
roadside
clean
and
sober
even
to
this
day
their
eyes
fill
when
they
think
of
her
of
how
on
that
morning
she
had
denied
herself
the
drink
and
had
come
forth
sober
with
the
grandchildren
washed
and
combed
to
do
honour
to
their
departure
when
they
had
all
passed
by
beggar
lina
also
began
to
weep
those
people
are
going
to
heaven
to
meet
jesus
she
told
the
children
all
those
people
are
going
to
heaven
but
we
are
left
standing
by
the
wayside
when
the
procession
of
carts
and
wagons
had
driven
halfway
through
the
parish
it
came
to
the
long
floating
bridge
that
lies
rocking
on
the
river
this
is
a
difficult
bridge
to
cross
the
first
part
of
it
is
a
steep
incline
all
the
way
down
to
the
edge
of
the
stream
then
come
two
rather
abrupt
elevations
under
which
boats
and
timber
rafts
can
pass
and
at
the
other
end
the
up
grade
is
so
heavy
that
both
man
and
beast
dread
to
climb
it
that
bridge
has
always
been
a
source
of
annoyance
the
planks
keep
rotting
and
have
to
be
replaced
continually
in
the
spring
when
the
ice
breaks
it
has
to
be
watched
day
and
night
to
prevent
its
being
knocked
to
pieces
by
drifting
ice
floes
and
when
the
spring
rains
cause
a
rise
in
the
river
large
portions
of
the
bridge
are
washed
away
but
the
people
of
the
parish
are
proud
of
their
bridge
and
glad
to
have
it
rickety
as
it
is
but
for
that
blessed
bridge
they
would
have
to
use
a
rowboat
or
a
ferry
every
time
they
wanted
to
cross
from
one
side
of
the
parish
to
the
other
the
bridge
groaned
and
swayed
as
the
passed
over
it
and
the
water
came
up
through
the
cracks
in
the
planks
and
splashed
the
horses
legs
they
felt
sad
at
having
to
leave
their
dear
old
bridge
for
they
knew
it
was
something
which
belonged
to
all
of
them
houses
and
farms
groves
and
meadows
were
owned
by
different
persons
but
the
bridge
was
their
common
property
but
was
there
nothing
else
that
they
had
in
common
had
they
not
the
church
in
among
the
birches
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
had
they
not
the
pretty
white
schoolhouse
and
the
parsonage
and
they
had
something
more
in
common
theirs
was
the
beauty
which
they
saw
from
the
bridge
the
lovely
view
of
the
broad
and
mighty
river
flowing
peacefully
on
between
its
banks
and
all
in
the
summer
light
the
wide
view
across
the
valley
clear
over
to
the
blue
hills
all
this
was
theirs
it
was
as
if
burned
into
their
eyes
and
now
they
would
never
see
it
again
when
the
hellgumists
came
to
the
middle
of
the
bridge
they
began
to
sing
one
of
sankey
hymns
we
shall
meet
once
again
they
sang
we
shall
meet
in
that
eden
above
there
was
no
one
on
the
bridge
to
hear
them
they
were
singing
to
the
blue
hills
of
their
homeland
to
the
silvery
waters
of
the
river
to
the
waving
trees
and
from
throats
tightened
by
sobs
and
tears
came
the
song
of
farewell
o
beautiful
homeland
with
thy
peaceful
farms
with
their
red
and
white
houses
with
thy
fertile
fields
and
green
meadows
thy
groves
and
orchards
thy
long
valley
divided
by
the
shining
river
hear
us
pray
god
that
we
may
meet
again
that
we
may
see
thee
again
in
paradise
when
the
long
procession
of
carts
and
wagons
had
crossed
the
bridge
it
came
to
the
churchyard
in
the
churchyard
there
was
a
large
flat
gravestone
that
was
crumbling
from
age
it
bore
neither
name
nor
date
but
according
to
tradition
the
bones
of
an
ancestor
of
the
ljung
family
rested
under
it
when
ljung
björn
olafsson
who
was
now
going
to
jerusalem
and
his
brother
pehr
were
children
they
had
once
sat
on
that
stone
and
talked
at
first
they
were
as
chummy
as
could
be
then
all
at
once
they
got
to
quarrelling
about
something
became
very
much
excited
and
raised
their
voices
what
they
quarrelled
about
they
had
long
since
forgotten
but
what
they
never
could
forget
was
that
while
they
were
quarreling
the
hardest
they
heard
several
distinct
and
deliberate
rappings
on
the
stone
where
they
were
seated
they
broke
off
instantly
then
they
took
each
other
by
the
hand
and
stole
quietly
away
afterward
they
could
never
see
that
stone
without
thinking
of
this
incident
and
now
when
ljung
björn
was
driving
past
the
churchyard
who
should
he
see
but
his
brother
pehr
sitting
on
that
selfsame
stone
with
his
head
resting
on
his
hands
ljung
björn
reined
in
his
horse
and
signalled
to
the
others
to
wait
for
him
he
got
down
from
the
cart
climbed
over
the
cemetery
wall
and
went
and
sat
on
the
stone
beside
his
brother
pehr
olafsson
immediately
said
so
you
sold
the
farm
björn
yes
answered
björn
i
have
given
all
i
owned
to
god
but
the
farm
was
not
yours
the
brother
mildly
protested
not
mine
no
it
belonged
to
the
family
ljung
björn
did
not
reply
but
sat
quietly
waiting
he
knew
that
when
his
brother
had
seated
himself
on
that
stone
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
speaking
words
of
peace
therefore
he
was
not
afraid
of
what
pehr
might
say
i
have
bought
back
the
farm
said
the
brother
ljung
björn
gave
a
start
could
you
bear
to
have
it
go
out
of
the
family
he
asked
i
hardly
rich
enough
to
do
such
things
for
that
reason
björn
looked
at
his
brother
inquiringly
i
did
it
that
you
might
have
something
to
come
back
to
björn
was
overwhelmed
and
could
hardly
keep
the
tears
back
and
that
your
children
may
have
a
place
to
come
back
to
björn
put
his
arm
around
his
brother
and
for
the
sake
of
my
dear
said
pehr
it
will
be
good
for
her
to
know
that
she
has
a
house
and
home
waiting
for
her
the
old
home
will
always
be
open
to
any
of
you
who
may
want
to
come
back
pehr
take
my
place
in
the
cart
and
go
to
jerusalem
and
i
stay
at
home
you
are
far
more
worthy
to
enter
the
promised
land
than
i
am
no
no
said
the
brother
smilingly
i
understand
how
you
mean
it
but
i
guess
i
fit
in
better
at
home
i
think
you
more
fit
for
heaven
said
björn
laying
his
head
on
his
brother
shoulder
now
you
must
forgive
me
everything
he
said
then
they
got
up
and
clasped
hands
in
farewell
this
time
there
were
no
rappings
pehr
remarked
strange
you
should
have
thought
of
coming
here
said
björn
we
brothers
have
had
some
difficulty
in
maintaining
peace
when
we
met
of
late
did
you
think
that
i
would
want
to
quarrel
no
but
i
become
angry
when
i
think
of
having
to
lose
you
they
walked
together
down
to
the
road
presently
pehr
went
up
to
björn
wife
and
gave
her
a
hearty
handclasp
i
bought
the
ljung
farm
he
said
i
tell
you
this
now
so
that
you
may
know
you
always
got
a
place
to
come
to
then
he
took
the
eldest
of
the
children
by
the
hand
and
said
remember
now
that
you
have
a
house
and
land
to
come
back
to
should
you
want
to
return
to
the
old
country
he
went
from
one
child
to
the
other
even
to
little
eric
who
was
only
two
years
old
and
understand
what
it
all
meant
the
rest
of
you
youngsters
must
not
forget
to
tell
little
eric
that
he
has
a
home
to
return
to
whenever
he
wants
to
come
back
and
the
went
on
when
the
long
line
of
carts
and
wagons
had
passed
the
churchyard
the
travellers
came
upon
a
large
crowd
of
friends
and
relatives
who
had
come
out
to
bid
them
goodbye
they
had
a
long
halt
here
for
everybody
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
them
and
say
a
few
parting
words
and
later
when
they
drove
through
the
village
the
road
was
lined
with
people
who
wished
to
witness
their
departure
there
were
people
standing
on
every
doorstep
and
leaning
out
of
every
window
they
sat
upon
the
low
stone
hedges
all
along
the
way
and
those
who
lived
farther
off
stood
on
mounds
and
hills
waving
a
last
farewell
the
long
procession
moved
slowly
past
all
these
people
until
it
came
to
the
home
of
councilman
lars
clementsson
where
it
halted
here
gunhild
got
down
to
say
to
her
folks
gunhild
had
been
staying
at
the
ingmar
farm
since
deciding
to
go
with
the
others
to
jerusalem
she
had
felt
that
this
was
preferable
to
living
at
home
in
constant
strife
with
her
parents
who
could
not
become
reconciled
to
the
thought
of
her
going
as
gunhild
stepped
down
from
the
cart
she
noticed
that
the
place
looked
quite
deserted
there
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
either
outside
or
at
the
windows
when
she
reached
the
gate
she
found
it
locked
she
stepped
over
the
stile
into
the
yard
even
the
front
door
of
the
house
was
fastened
then
gunhild
went
round
to
the
kitchen
door
it
was
hooked
on
the
inside
she
knocked
several
times
but
as
no
one
came
she
pulled
the
door
toward
her
inserted
a
stick
in
the
crack
and
lifted
the
hook
so
she
finally
got
in
there
was
no
one
in
the
kitchen
nor
was
there
any
one
in
the
nor
yet
in
the
inner
room
gunhild
did
not
want
to
go
away
without
letting
her
parents
know
that
she
had
been
to
say
to
them
she
went
over
to
the
big
combination
desk
and
bureau
where
her
father
always
kept
his
writing
materials
and
drew
down
the
lid
she
could
not
at
first
find
the
ink
so
looked
for
it
in
drawers
and
pigeonholes
while
searching
she
came
upon
a
small
casket
which
she
remembered
well
it
was
her
mother
she
had
received
it
from
her
husband
as
a
wedding
present
when
gunhild
was
a
little
girl
her
mother
had
often
shown
it
to
her
the
casket
was
enamelled
in
white
with
a
garland
of
flowers
on
the
inside
of
the
lid
was
a
picture
of
a
shepherd
piping
to
a
flock
of
white
lambs
gunhild
now
opened
the
box
to
take
a
last
peep
at
the
shepherd
in
this
casket
gunhild
mother
had
always
kept
her
most
cherished
wedding
ring
which
had
belonged
to
her
mother
the
watch
which
had
been
her
father
and
her
own
gold
earrings
but
when
gunhild
opened
the
box
she
found
that
all
these
things
had
been
taken
out
and
in
their
place
lay
a
letter
it
was
a
letter
that
she
herself
had
written
a
year
or
two
before
she
had
made
a
trip
to
mora
by
boat
across
lake
siljan
the
boat
had
capsized
some
of
her
were
drowned
and
her
parents
had
been
told
that
she
too
had
perished
it
flashed
upon
gunhild
that
her
mother
must
have
been
made
so
happy
on
receiving
a
letter
from
her
daughter
telling
of
her
safety
that
she
had
taken
everything
else
out
of
the
casket
and
placed
the
letter
there
as
her
most
priceless
treasure
gunhild
turned
as
pale
as
death
her
heart
was
being
wrung
now
i
know
that
i
killing
my
mother
she
said
she
no
longer
thought
of
writing
anything
but
hurried
away
she
got
up
into
the
cart
taking
no
notice
of
the
many
questions
as
to
whether
she
had
seen
her
parents
during
the
remainder
of
the
drive
she
sat
motionless
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
staring
straight
ahead
i
killing
my
mother
she
was
saying
to
herself
i
know
that
i
killing
my
mother
i
know
that
mother
will
die
i
can
never
be
happy
again
i
may
go
to
the
holy
land
but
i
am
killing
my
own
mother
when
the
long
line
of
carts
and
wagons
had
passed
through
the
village
it
turned
in
on
a
forest
road
here
the
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
they
were
being
shadowed
by
two
persons
whom
they
did
not
seem
to
know
while
still
in
the
village
they
had
been
so
engrossed
in
their
that
they
had
not
seen
the
strange
vehicle
in
which
the
two
unknown
people
sat
but
in
the
wood
their
attention
was
drawn
to
it
sometimes
it
would
drive
past
all
the
other
carts
and
lead
the
procession
then
again
it
would
take
the
side
of
the
road
and
let
the
other
teams
go
by
it
was
an
ordinary
wagon
the
kind
commonly
used
for
carting
therefore
it
was
impossible
to
tell
to
whom
it
belonged
nor
did
any
one
recognize
the
horse
it
was
driven
by
an
old
man
who
was
much
bent
and
had
wrinkled
hands
and
a
long
white
beard
certainly
none
of
them
knew
who
he
was
but
by
his
side
sat
a
woman
whom
they
somehow
felt
they
knew
no
one
could
see
her
face
for
her
head
was
covered
with
a
black
shawl
both
sides
of
which
she
held
together
so
closely
that
not
even
her
eyes
were
seen
many
tried
to
guess
from
her
figure
and
size
who
she
was
but
no
two
guessed
alike
gunhild
said
at
once
it
my
mother
and
israel
tomasson
wife
declared
that
it
was
her
sister
there
was
scarcely
a
person
among
them
but
had
his
or
her
own
notion
as
to
who
it
was
tims
halvor
thought
it
was
old
eva
gunnersdotter
the
strange
cart
accompanied
them
all
the
way
but
not
once
did
the
woman
draw
the
shawl
back
from
her
face
to
some
of
the
hellgumists
she
became
a
person
they
loved
to
others
one
they
feared
but
to
most
of
them
she
was
some
one
whom
they
had
deserted
wherever
the
road
was
wide
enough
to
allow
of
it
the
strange
cart
would
drive
past
the
whole
line
of
wagons
and
then
pull
to
one
side
until
they
had
all
gone
by
at
such
times
the
unknown
woman
would
turn
toward
the
travellers
and
watch
them
from
behind
her
drawn
shawl
but
she
made
no
sign
to
any
of
them
so
that
no
one
could
really
say
for
certain
who
she
was
she
followed
all
the
way
to
the
railway
station
there
they
expected
to
see
her
face
but
when
they
got
down
and
began
to
look
around
for
her
she
was
gone
when
the
procession
of
carts
and
wagons
passed
along
the
countryside
no
one
was
seen
cutting
grass
or
raking
hay
or
stacking
hay
that
morning
all
work
had
been
suspended
and
every
one
was
either
standing
at
the
roadside
in
their
sunday
clothes
or
driving
to
see
the
travellers
off
some
went
with
them
six
miles
some
twelve
a
few
accompanied
them
all
the
way
to
the
railway
station
throughout
the
entire
length
and
breadth
of
the
parish
only
one
man
was
seen
at
work
that
man
was
hök
matts
ericsson
nor
was
he
mowing
he
regarded
as
only
child
play
he
was
clearing
away
stones
from
his
land
just
as
he
had
done
in
his
youth
when
preparing
his
newly
acquired
acres
for
cultivation
gabriel
as
he
drove
along
could
see
his
father
from
the
road
hök
matts
was
out
in
the
grove
prying
up
stones
with
his
crowbar
and
piling
them
on
to
a
stone
hedge
he
never
once
looked
up
from
his
work
but
went
right
on
digging
and
lugging
stones
some
of
which
were
so
big
that
gabriel
thought
they
were
enough
to
break
his
back
and
afterward
throwing
them
up
on
to
the
hedge
with
a
force
that
caused
them
to
splinter
and
made
sparks
fly
gabriel
who
was
driving
one
of
the
goods
wagons
let
his
horse
look
out
for
itself
for
a
long
time
while
his
eyes
were
turned
toward
his
father
old
hök
matts
worked
on
and
on
toiling
and
slaving
exactly
as
he
had
done
when
his
son
was
a
little
lad
and
he
strove
to
develop
his
property
grief
had
taken
a
firm
hold
on
hök
matts
yet
he
went
on
digging
and
prying
up
larger
and
larger
stones
and
piling
them
on
the
hedge
soon
after
the
procession
had
passed
a
violent
thunderstorm
came
up
everybody
ran
for
cover
and
hök
matts
too
thought
of
doing
the
same
then
he
changed
his
mind
he
dared
not
leave
off
working
at
noon
his
daughter
came
to
the
door
and
called
to
him
to
come
to
dinner
hök
matts
was
not
very
hungry
still
he
felt
that
he
might
need
a
bite
to
eat
he
did
not
go
in
however
for
he
was
afraid
to
stop
his
work
his
wife
had
gone
with
gabriel
to
the
railway
station
on
her
return
late
in
the
evening
she
stopped
to
tell
her
husband
that
now
their
son
had
gone
but
he
would
not
leave
off
an
instant
to
hear
what
she
had
to
say
the
neighbours
noticed
how
hök
matts
worked
that
day
they
came
out
to
watch
him
and
after
looking
on
a
while
they
went
in
and
reported
that
he
was
still
there
that
he
had
been
at
it
the
whole
day
without
a
break
evening
came
but
the
light
lingered
a
while
and
hök
matts
kept
right
on
working
he
felt
that
if
he
were
to
leave
off
while
still
able
to
drag
a
foot
his
grief
would
overpower
him
by
and
by
his
wife
came
back
again
and
stood
watching
him
the
grove
was
now
almost
clear
of
stones
and
the
hedge
quite
high
enough
but
still
the
little
old
man
went
on
lugging
stones
that
were
more
fit
for
a
giant
to
handle
now
and
then
a
neighbour
would
come
over
to
see
if
he
was
still
at
it
but
no
one
spoke
to
him
then
darkness
fell
they
could
no
longer
see
him
but
they
could
hear
him
could
hear
the
dull
thud
of
stone
against
stone
as
he
went
on
building
the
wall
then
at
last
as
he
raised
the
crowbar
it
slipped
from
his
hands
and
when
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
he
fell
and
before
he
could
think
he
was
asleep
some
time
afterward
he
roused
himself
sufficiently
to
get
to
the
house
he
said
nothing
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
undress
but
simply
threw
himself
down
on
a
wooden
bench
and
dropped
off
to
sleep
the
had
at
last
reached
the
railway
station
which
was
newly
built
in
a
big
clearing
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
there
was
no
town
nor
were
there
any
fields
or
gardens
but
everything
had
been
planned
on
a
grand
scale
in
the
expectation
that
an
important
railway
community
would
some
day
spring
up
in
this
wilderness
round
the
station
itself
the
ground
was
levelled
there
was
a
broad
stone
platform
with
roomy
baggage
sheds
and
no
end
of
gravel
drives
a
couple
of
stores
and
workshops
a
photographic
studio
and
a
hotel
had
already
been
put
up
around
the
gravelled
square
but
the
remainder
of
the
clearing
was
nothing
but
unbroken
stubble
land
the
dal
river
also
flowed
past
here
it
came
with
a
wild
and
angry
rush
from
the
dark
woods
and
dashed
foamingly
onward
in
a
cascade
of
falls
the
could
hardly
credit
that
this
was
a
part
of
the
broad
majestic
river
they
had
crossed
in
the
morning
here
no
smiling
valley
met
their
gaze
on
all
sides
the
view
was
obstructed
by
dark
heights
when
the
little
children
who
were
going
with
their
parents
to
jerusalem
were
lifted
out
of
the
carts
in
this
place
they
became
uneasy
and
began
to
cry
before
they
had
been
very
happy
in
the
thought
of
travelling
to
jerusalem
of
course
they
had
cried
a
good
deal
when
leaving
their
homes
but
down
at
the
station
they
became
quite
disconsolate
their
elders
were
busy
unloading
their
goods
from
the
wagons
and
stowing
them
away
in
a
baggage
car
they
all
helped
so
that
no
one
had
any
time
to
look
after
the
children
and
see
what
they
were
up
to
the
youngsters
meanwhile
got
together
and
held
council
as
to
what
they
should
do
after
a
bit
the
older
children
took
the
little
ones
by
the
hand
and
walked
away
from
the
station
two
by
big
child
and
a
little
child
they
went
the
same
way
they
had
come
across
the
sea
of
sand
through
the
stubble
ground
over
the
river
and
into
the
dark
forest
suddenly
one
of
the
women
happened
to
think
of
the
children
and
opened
a
food
basket
to
give
them
something
to
eat
she
called
to
them
but
got
no
answer
they
had
disappeared
from
sight
two
of
the
men
went
to
look
for
them
following
the
tracks
which
the
many
little
feet
had
left
in
the
sand
they
went
on
into
the
woods
where
they
caught
sight
of
the
youngsters
marching
along
in
line
two
by
two
a
big
child
and
a
little
child
when
the
men
called
to
them
they
did
not
stop
but
kept
right
on
the
men
ran
to
overtake
them
then
the
children
tried
to
run
away
but
the
smaller
ones
could
not
keep
up
they
stumbled
and
fell
then
all
of
them
stood
still
wretchedly
unhappy
and
crying
as
if
their
little
hearts
would
break
but
children
where
are
you
going
asked
one
of
the
men
whereupon
the
littlest
ones
set
up
a
loud
wail
and
the
eldest
boy
answered
we
do
want
to
go
to
jerusalem
we
want
to
go
home
and
for
a
long
time
even
after
the
children
had
been
brought
back
to
the
station
and
were
seated
in
the
railway
carriage
they
still
went
on
whimpering
and
crying
we
do
want
to
go
to
jerusalem
we
want
to
go
home
