of
his
most
exalted
attributes
through
him
the
light
of
unity
hath
shone
forth
above
the
horizon
of
the
world
and
the
law
of
oneness
hath
been
revealed
amidst
the
nations
who
with
radiant
faces
have
turned
towards
the
supreme
horizon
and
acknowledged
that
which
the
tongue
of
utterance

spoken
in

counselleth
thee
for

sake

exhorteth
thee
unto
that

draw
nigh

thou
that

it
may
hearken
unto
the
divine
voice
on
this
day
that
hath
been
mentioned
in
all
the
books
scriptures
and
tablets
purify
thou
first
thy
soul
with
the
waters
of
renunciation
and
adorn
thine
head
with
the
crown
of
the
fear
of
god
and
thy
temple
with
the
ornament
of
reliance
upon
him
arise
then
and
with
thy
face
set
towards
the
most
great
house
the
spot
round
which
as
decreed
by
the
eternal
king
all
that
dwell
on
earth
must
circle
recite
o
god
my
god
and
my
desire
and
my
adored
one
and
my
master
and
my
mainstay
and
my
utmost
hope
and
my
supreme
aspiration
thou
seest
me
turning
towards
thee
holding
fast
unto
the
cord
of
thy
bounty
clinging
to
the
hem
of
thy
generosity
acknowledging
the
sanctity
of
thy
self
and
the
purity
of
thine
essence
and
testifying
to
thy
unity
and
thy
oneness
i
bear
witness
that
thou
art
the
one
the
single
the
incomparable
the
thou
didst
not
take
unto
thyself
a
partner
in
thy
dominion
nor
didst
thou
choose
a
peer
for
thyself
upon
earth
all
created
things
have
borne
witness
unto
that
which
the
tongue
of
thy
grandeur
hath
testified
ere
their
creation
verily
thou
art
god
there
is
none
other
god
but
thee
from
everlasting
thou
wast
sanctified
from
the
mention
of
thy
servants
and
exalted
above
the
description
of
thy
creatures
thou
beholdest
o
lord
the
ignorant
seeking
the
ocean
of
thy
knowledge
the
sore
athirst
the
living
waters
of
thine
utterance
the
abased
the
tabernacle
of
thy
glory
the
poor
the
treasury
of
thy
riches
the
suppliant
the
of
thy
wisdom
the
weak
the
source
of
thy
strength
the
wretched
the
heaven
of
thy
bounty
the
dumb
the
kingdom
of
thy
mention
i
testify
o
my
god
and
my
king
that
thou
hast
created
me
to
remember
thee
to
glorify
thee
and
to
aid
thy
cause
and
yet
i
have
aided
thine
enemies
who
have
broken
thy
covenant
who
have
cast
away
thy
book
disbelieved
in
thee
and
repudiated
thy
signs
alas
alas
for
my
waywardness
and
my
shame
and
my
sinfulness
and
my
that
have
withheld
me
from
the
depths
of
the
ocean
of
thy
unity
and
from
fathoming
the
sea
of
thy
mercy
wherefore
alas
alas
and
again
alas
alas
for
my
wretchedness
and
the
grievousness
of
my
transgressions
thou
didst
call
me
into
being
o
my
god
to
exalt
thy
word
and
to
manifest
thy
cause
my
heedlessness
however
hath
deterred
me
and
compassed
me
about
in
such
wise
that
i
have
arisen
to
blot
out
thy
signs
and
to
shed
the
blood
of
thy
loved
ones
and
of
the
of
thy
signs
and
of
the
daysprings
of
thy
revelation
and
of
the
repositories
of
thy
mysteries
o
lord
my
lord
and
again
o
lord
my
lord
and
yet
again
o
lord
my
lord
i
bear
witness
that
by
reason
of
mine
iniquity
the
fruits
of
the
tree
of
thy
justice
have
fallen
and
through
the
fire
of
my
rebelliousness
the
hearts
of
such
of
thy
creatures
as
enjoy
near
access
to
thee
were
consumed
and
the
souls
of
the
sincere
among
thy
servants
have
melted
o
wretched
wretched
that
i
am
o
the
cruelties
the
glaring
cruelties
i
inflicted
woe
is
me
woe
is
me
for
my
remoteness
from
thee
and
for
my
waywardness
and
mine
ignorance
and
my
baseness
and
my
repudiation
of
thee
and
my
protests
against
thee
how
many
the
days
during
which
thou
didst
bid
thy
servants
and
thy
loved
ones
to
protect
me
whilst
i
commanded
them
to
harm
thee
and
to
harm
them
that
thou
didst
trust
and
how
numerous
the
nights
during
which
thou
didst
graciously
remember
me
and
didst
show
me
thy
path
whilst
i
turned
away
from
thee
and
from
thy
signs
by
thy
glory
o
thou
who
art
the
hope
of
such
as
have
acknowledged
thy
unity
and
the
desire
of
the
hearts
of
them
that
are
rid
of
all
attachment
to
any
save
thee
i
find
no
succorer
except
thee
nor
king
nor
refuge
nor
haven
besides
thyself
alas
alas
my
turning
away
from
thee
hath
burnt
up
the
veil
of
mine
integrity
and
my
denial
of
thee
hath
rent
asunder
the
covering
cast
over
mine
honor
o
would
that
i
were
beneath
the
depths
of
the
earth
so
that
my
evil
deeds
would
remain
unknown
to
thy
servants
thou
seest
the
sinner
o
my
lord
who
hath
turned
towards
the
of
thy
forgiveness
and
thy
bounty
and
the
mountain
of
iniquity
that
hath
sought
the
heaven
of
thy
mercy
and
pardon
alas
alas
my
mighty
sins
have
prevented
me
from
approaching
the
court
of
thy
mercy
and
my
monstrous
deeds
have
caused
me
to
stray
far
from
the
sanctuary
of
thy
presence
indeed
i
am
he
that
hath
failed
in
duty
towards
thee
and
hath
broken
thy
covenant
and
thy
testament
and
committed
that
which
hath
made
the
dwellers
of
the
cities
of
thy
justice
and
the
of
thy
grace
in
thy
realms
to
lament
i
testify
o
my
god
that
i
have
put
away
thy
commandments
and
clung
to
the
dictates
of
my
passions
and
have
cast
away
the
statutes
of
thy
book
and
seized
the
book
of
mine
own
desire
o
misery
misery
as
mine
iniquities
waxed
greater
and
greater
thy
forbearance
towards
me
augmented
and
as
the
fire
of
my
rebelliousness
grew
fiercer
the
more
did
thy
forgiveness
and
thy
grace
seek
to
smother
up
its
flame
by
the
power
of
thy
might
o
thou
who
art
the
desire
of
the
world
and
the
of
the
nations
thy
hath
puffed
me
up
and
thy
patience
hath
emboldened
me
thou
beholdest
o
my
god
the
tears
that
my
shame
hath
caused
to
flow
and
the
sighs
which
my
heedlessness
hath
led
me
to
utter
i
swear
by
the
greatness
of
thy
majesty
i
can
find
for
myself
no
habitation
save
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
court
of
thy
bounty
nor
any
refuge
except
under
the
canopy
of
thy
mercy
thou
seest
me
in
the
midst
of
a
sea
of
despair
and
of
hopelessness
after
thou
didst
cause
me
to
hear
thy
words
despair
not
by
thy
power
my
sore
injustice
hath
severed
the
cord
of
my
hope
and
my
rebellion
hath
darkened
my
face
before
the
throne
of
thy
justice
thou
beholdest
o
my
god
him
who
is
as
one
dead
fallen
at
the
door
of
thy
favor
ashamed
to
seek
from
the
hand
of
thy
the
living
waters
of
thy
pardon
thou
hast
given
me
a
tongue
wherewith
to
remember
and
praise
thee
and
yet
it
uttereth
that
which
hath
caused
the
souls
of
such
of
thy
chosen
ones
as
are
nigh
unto
thee
to
melt
and
the
hearts
of
the
sincere
amongst
the
dwellers
of
the
habitations
of
holiness
to
be
consumed
thou
hast
given
me
eyes
to
witness
thy
signs
and
to
behold
thy
verses
and
to
contemplate
the
revelations
of
thine
handiwork
but
i
have
rejected
thy
will
and
have
committed
what
hath
caused
the
faithful
among
thy
creatures
and
the
detached
amidst
thy
servants
to
groan
thou
hast
given
me
ears
that
i
may
incline
them
unto
thy
praise
and
thy
celebration
and
unto
that
which
thou
didst
send
down
from
the
heaven
of
thy
bounty
and
the
firmament
of
thy
will
and
yet
alas
alas
i
have
forsaken
thy
cause
and
have
commanded
thy
servants
to
blaspheme
against
thy
trusted
ones
and
thy
loved
ones
and
have
acted
before
the
throne
of
thy
justice
in
such
wise
that
those
that
have
recognized
thy
unity
and
are
wholly
devoted
to
thee
among
the
dwellers
of
thy
realm
mourned
with
a
sore
lamentation
i
know
not
o
my
god
which
among
my
evildoings
to
mention
before
the
billowing
ocean
of
thy
favor
nor
which
of
my
trespasses
to
declare
when
face
to
face
with
the
splendors
of
the
suns
of
thy
goodly
gifts
and
bounties
i
beseech
thee
this
very
moment
by
the
mysteries
of
thy
book
and
by
the
things
hid
in
thy
knowledge
and
by
the
pearls
that
lie
concealed
within
the
shells
of
the
ocean
of
thy
mercy
to
reckon
me
among
such
as
thou
didst
mention
in
thy
book
and
describe
in
thy
tablets
hast
thou
decreed
for
me
o
my
god
any
joy
after
this
tribulation
or
any
relief
to
succeed
this
affliction
or
any
ease
to
follow
this
trouble
alas
alas
thou
hast
ordained
that
every
pulpit
be
set
apart
for
thy
mention
and
for
the
glorification
of
thy
word
and
the
revelation
of
thy
cause
but
i
have
ascended
it
to
proclaim
the
violation
of
thy
covenant
and
have
spoken
unto
thy
servants
such
words
as
have
caused
the
dwellers
of
the
tabernacles
of
thy
majesty
and
the
denizens
of
the
cities
of
thy
wisdom
to
lament
how
often
hast
thou
sent
down
the
food
of
thine
utterance
out
of
the
heaven
of
thy
bounty
and
i
denied
it
and
how
numerous
the
occasions
on
which
thou
hast
summoned
me
to
the
soft
flowing
waters
of
thy
mercy
and
i
have
chosen
to
turn
away
therefrom
by
reason
of
my
having
followed
my
own
wish
and
desire
by
thy
glory
i
know
not
for
which
sin
to
beg
thy
forgiveness
and
implore
thy
pardon
nor
from
which
of
mine
iniquities
to
turn
aside
unto
the
court
of
thy
bounteousness
and
the
sanctuary
of
thy
favor
such
are
my
sins
and
trespasses
that
no
man
can
number
them
nor
pen
describe
them
i
implore
thee
o
thou
that
turnest
darkness
into
light
and
revealest
thy
mysteries
on
the
sinai
of
thy
revelation
to
aid
me
at
all
times
to
put
my
trust
in
thee
and
to
commit
mine
affairs
unto
thy
care
make
me
then
o
my
god
content
with
that
which
the
finger
of
thy
decree
hath
traced
and
the
pen
of
thy
ordinance
hath
written
potent
art
thou
to
do
what
pleaseth
thee
and
in
thy
grasp
are
the
reins
of
all
that
are
in
heaven
and
on
earth
no
god
is
there
but
thee
the
the
o
know
thou
that
neither
the
calumnies
which
men
may
utter
nor
their
denials
nor
any
cavils
they
may
raise
can
harm
him
that
hath
clung
to
the
cord
of
the
grace
and
seized
the
hem
of
the
mercy
of
the
lord
of
creation
by
god
he
the
glory
of
god
bahá
hath
spoken
not
from
mere
impulse
he
that
hath
given
him
a
voice
is
he
that
hath
given
a
voice
unto
all
things
that
they
may
praise
and
glorify
him
there
is
none
other
god
but
him
the
one
the
incomparable
the
lord
of
strength
the
unconditioned
they
whose
sight
is
keen
whose
ears
are
retentive
whose
hearts
are
enlightened
and
whose
breasts
are
dilated
recognize
both
truth
and
falsehood
and
distinguish
the
one
from
the
other
recite
thou
this
prayer
that
hath
flowed
from
the
tongue
of
this
wronged
one
and
ponder
thereon
with
a
heart
rid
of
all
attachment
and
with
ears
that
are
pure
and
sanctified
be
attentive
to
its
meaning
that
haply
thou
mayest
inhale
the
breath
of
detachment
and
have
pity
upon
thyself
and
upon
others
my
god
the
object
of
my
adoration
the
goal
of
my
desire
the
the
most
compassionate
all
life
is
of
thee
and
all
power
lieth
within
the
grasp
of
thine
omnipotence
whosoever
thou
exaltest
is
raised
above
the
angels
and
attaineth
the
station
verily
we
uplifted
him
to
a
place
on
high
and
whosoever
thou
dost
abase
is
made
lower
than
dust
nay
less
than
nothing
o
divine
providence
though
wicked
sinful
and
intemperate
we
still
seek
from
thee
a
seat
of
truth
and
long
to
behold
the
countenance
of
the
omnipotent
king
it
is
thine
to
command
and
all
sovereignty
belongeth
to
thee
and
the
realm
of
might
boweth
before
thy
behest
everything
thou
doest
is
pure
justice
nay
the
very
essence
of
grace
one
gleam
from
the
splendors
of
thy
name
the
sufficeth
to
banish
and
blot
out
every
trace
of
sinfulness
from
the
world
and
a
single
breath
from
the
breezes
of
the
day
of
thy
revelation
is
enough
to
adorn
all
mankind
with
a
fresh
attire
vouchsafe
thy
strength
o
almighty
one
unto
thy
weak
creatures
and
quicken
them
who
are
as
dead
that
haply
they
may
find
thee
and
may
be
led
unto
the
ocean
of
thy
guidance
and
may
remain
steadfast
in
thy
cause
should
the
fragrance
of
thy
praise
be
shed
abroad
by
any
of
the
divers
tongues
of
the
world
out
of
the
east
or
out
of
the
west
it
would
verily
be
prized
and
greatly
cherished
if
such
tongues
however
be
deprived
of
that
fragrance
they
assuredly
would
be
unworthy
of
any
mention
in
word
or
yet
in
thought
we
beg
of
thee
o
providence
to
show
thy
way
unto
all
men
and
to
guide
them
aright
thou
art
verily
the
almighty
the
most
powerful
the
the
we
beseech
god
to
aid
thee
to
be
just
and
and
to
acquaint
thee
with
the
things
that
were
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
men
he
in
truth
is
the
mighty
the
unconstrained
we
ask
thee
to
reflect
upon
that
which
hath
been
revealed
and
to
be
fair
and
just
in
thy
speech
that
perchance
the
splendors
of
the
daystar
of
truthfulness
and
sincerity
may
shine
forth
and
may
deliver
thee
from
the
darkness
of
ignorance
and
illumine
the
world
with
the
light
of
knowledge
this
wronged
one
hath
frequented
no
school
neither
hath
he
attended
the
controversies
of
the
learned
by
my
life
not
of
mine
own
volition
have
i
revealed
myself
but
god
of
his
own
choosing
hath
manifested
me
in
the
tablet
addressed
to
his
majesty
the
god
blessed
and
glorified
be
he
assist
words
have
streamed
from
the
tongue
of
this
wronged
one
o
king
i
was
but
a
man
like
others
asleep
upon
my
couch
when
lo
the
breezes
of
the
were
wafted
over
me
and
taught
me
the
knowledge
of
all
that
hath
been
this
thing
is
not
from
me
but
from
one
who
is
almighty
and
and
he
bade
me
lift
up
my
voice
between
earth
and
heaven
and
for
this
there
befell
me
what
hath
caused
the
tears
of
every
man
of
understanding
to
flow
the
learning
current
amongst
men
i
studied
not
their
schools
i
entered
not
ask
of
the
city
wherein
i
dwelt
that
thou
mayest
be
well
assured
that
i
am
not
of
them
who
speak
falsely
this
is
but
a
leaf
which
the
winds
of
the
will
of
thy
lord
the
almighty
the
have
stirred
can
it
be
still
when
the
tempestuous
winds
are
blowing
nay
by
him
who
is
the
lord
of
all
names
and
attributes
they
move
it
as
they
list
the
evanescent
is
as
nothing
before
him
who
is
the
his
summons
hath
reached
me
and
caused
me
to
speak
his
praise
amidst
all
people
i
was
indeed
as
one
dead
when
his
behest
was
uttered
the
hand
of
the
will
of
thy
lord
the
compassionate
the
merciful
transformed
me
now
is
the
moment
in
which
to
cleanse
thyself
with
the
waters
of
detachment
that
have
flowed
out
from
the
supreme
pen
and
to
ponder
wholly
for
the
sake
of
god
those
things
which
time
and
again
have
been
sent
down
or
manifested
and
then
to
strive
as
much
as
lieth
in
thee
to
quench
through
the
power
of
wisdom
and
the
force
of
thy
utterance
the
fire
of
enmity
and
hatred
which
smouldereth
in
the
hearts
of
the
peoples
of
the
world
the
divine
messengers
have
been
sent
down
and
their
books
were
revealed
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
the
knowledge
of
god
and
of
furthering
unity
and
fellowship
amongst
men
but
now
behold
how
they
have
made
the
law
of
god
a
cause
and
pretext
for
perversity
and
hatred
how
pitiful
how
regrettable
that
most
men
are
cleaving
fast
to
and
have
busied
themselves
with
the
things
they
possess
and
are
unaware
of
and
shut
out
as
by
a
veil
from
the
things
god
possesseth
say
o
god
my
god
attire
mine
head
with
the
crown
of
justice
and
my
temple
with
the
ornament
of
equity
thou
verily
art
the
possessor
of
all
gifts
and
bounties
justice
and
equity
are
twin
guardians
that
watch
over
men
from
them
are
revealed
such
blessed
and
perspicuous
words
as
are
the
cause
of
the
of
the
world
and
the
protection
of
the
nations
these
words
have
streamed
from
the
pen
of
this
wronged
one
in
one
of
his
tablets
the
purpose
of
the
one
true
god
exalted
be
his
glory
hath
been
to
bring
forth
the
mystic
gems
out
of
the
mine
of
who
are
the
of
his
cause
and
the
repositories
of
the
pearls
of
his
knowledge
for
god
himself
glorified
be
he
is
the
unseen
the
one
concealed
and
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
men
consider
what
the
merciful
hath
revealed
in
the
qur
án
no
vision
taketh
in
him
but
he
taketh
in
all
vision
and
he
is
the
subtile
the
that
the
divers
communions
of
the
earth
and
the
manifold
systems
of
religious
belief
should
never
be
allowed
to
foster
the
feelings
of
animosity
among
men
is
in
this
day
of
the
essence
of
the
faith
of
god
and
his
religion
these
principles
and
laws
these
and
mighty
systems
have
proceeded
from
one
source
and
are
rays
of
one
light
that
they
differ
one
from
another
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
varying
requirements
of
the
ages
in
which
they
were
promulgated
gird
up
the
loins
of
your
endeavor
o
people
of
bahá
that
haply
the
tumult
of
religious
dissension
and
strife
that
agitateth
the
peoples
of
the
earth
may
be
stilled
that
every
trace
of
it
may
be
completely
obliterated
for
the
love
of
god
and
them
that
serve
him
arise
to
aid
this
sublime
and
momentous
revelation
religious
fanaticism
and
hatred
are
a
fire
whose
violence
none
can
quench
the
hand
of
divine
power
can
alone
deliver
mankind
from
this
desolating
affliction
consider
the
war
that
hath
involved
the
two
nations
how
both
sides
have
renounced
their
possessions
and
their
lives
how
many
the
villages
that
were
completely
wiped
out
the
utterance
of
god
is
a
lamp
whose
light
is
these
words
ye
are
the
fruits
of
one
tree
and
the
leaves
of
one
branch
deal
ye
one
with
another
with
the
utmost
love
and
harmony
with
friendliness
and
fellowship
he
who
is
the
daystar
of
truth
beareth
me
witness
so
powerful
is
the
light
of
unity
that
it
can
illuminate
the
whole
earth
the
one
true
god
he
who
knoweth
all
things
himself
testifieth
to
the
truth
of
these
words
exert
yourselves
that
ye
may
attain
this
transcendent
and
most
sublime
station
the
station
that
can
insure
the
protection
and
security
of
all
mankind
this
goal
excelleth
every
other
goal
and
this
aspiration
is
the
monarch
of
all
aspirations
so
long
however
as
the
thick
clouds
of
oppression
which
obscure
the
daystar
of
justice
remain
undispelled
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
glory
of
this
station
to
be
unveiled
to
men
s
eyes
these
thick
clouds
are
the
exponents
of
idle
fancies
and
vain
imaginings
who
are
none
other
but
the
divines
of
persia
at
one
time
we
spoke
in
the
language
of
the
lawgiver
at
another
in
that
of
the
and
the
mystic
and
yet
our
supreme
purpose
and
highest
wish
hath
always
been
to
disclose
the
glory
and
sublimity
of
this
station
god
verily
is
a
sufficient
witness
consort
with
all
men
o
people
of
bahá
in
a
spirit
of
friendliness
and
fellowship
if
ye
be
aware
of
a
certain
truth
if
ye
possess
a
jewel
of
which
others
are
deprived
share
it
with
them
in
a
language
of
utmost
kindliness
and
goodwill
if
it
be
accepted
if
it
fulfill
its
purpose
your
object
is
attained
if
anyone
should
refuse
it
leave
him
unto
himself
and
beseech
god
to
guide
him
beware
lest
ye
deal
unkindly
with
him
a
kindly
tongue
is
the
lodestone
of
the
hearts
of
men
it
is
the
bread
of
the
spirit
it
clotheth
the
words
with
meaning
it
is
the
fountain
of
the
light
of
wisdom
and
understanding
by
divines
in
the
passage
cited
above
is
meant
those
men
who
outwardly
attire
themselves
with
the
raiment
of
knowledge
but
who
inwardly
are
deprived
therefrom
in
this
connection
we
quote
from
the
tablet
addressed
to
his
majesty
the
certain
passages
from
the
hidden
words
which
were
revealed
by
the
abhá
pen
under
the
name
of
the
book
of
fátimih
the
blessings
of
god
be
upon
her
o
ye
that
are
foolish
yet
have
a
name
to
be
wise
wherefore
do
ye
wear
the
guise
of
the
shepherd
when
inwardly
ye
have
become
wolves
intent
upon
my
flock
ye
are
even
as
the
star
which
riseth
ere
the
dawn
and
which
though
it
seem
radiant
and
luminous
leadeth
the
wayfarers
of
my
city
astray
into
the
paths
of
perdition
and
likewise
he
saith
o
ye
seeming
fair
yet
inwardly
foul
ye
are
like
clear
but
bitter
water
which
to
outward
seeming
is
crystal
pure
but
of
which
when
tested
by
the
divine
assayer
not
a
drop
is
accepted
yea
the
sunbeam
falls
alike
upon
the
dust
and
the
mirror
yet
differ
they
in
reflection
even
as
doth
the
star
from
the
earth
nay
immeasurable
is
the
difference
and
also
he
saith
o
essence
of
desire
at
many
a
dawn
have
i
turned
from
the
realms
of
the
placeless
unto
thine
abode
and
found
thee
on
the
bed
of
ease
busied
with
others
than
myself
thereupon
even
as
the
flash
of
the
spirit
i
returned
to
the
realms
of
celest
and
breathed
it
not
in
my
retreats
above
unto
the
hosts
of
holiness
and
again
he
saith
o
bond
slave
of
the
world
many
a
dawn
hath
the
breeze
of
my
wafted
over
thee
and
found
thee
upon
the
bed
of
heedlessness
fast
asleep
bewailing
then
thy
plight
it
returned
whence
it
came
those
divines
however
who
are
truly
adorned
with
the
ornament
of
knowledge
and
of
a
goodly
character
are
verily
as
a
head
to
the
body
of
the
world
and
as
eyes
to
the
nations
the
guidance
of
men
hath
at
all
times
been
and
is
dependent
upon
such
blessed
souls
we
beseech
god
to
graciously
aid
them
to
do
his
will
and
pleasure
he
in
truth
is
the
lord
of
all
men
the
lord
of
this
world
and
of
the
next
o
we
have
learned
that
thou
hast
turned
away
from
us
and
protested
against
us
in
such
wise
that
thou
hast
bidden
the
people
to
curse
me
and
decreed
that
the
blood
of
the
servants
of
god
be
shed
god
requite
him
who
said
willingly
will
i
obey
the
judge
who
hath
so
strangely
decreed
that
my
blood
be
spilt
at
hill
and
at
ḥaram
verily
i
say
whatever
befalleth
in
the
path
of
god
is
the
beloved
of
the
soul
and
the
desire
of
the
heart
deadly
poison
in
his
path
is
pure
honey
and
every
tribulation
a
draught
of
crystal
water
in
the
tablet
to
his
majesty
the
it
is
written
by
him
who
is
the
truth
i
fear
no
tribulation
in
his
path
nor
any
affliction
in
my
love
for
him
verily
god
hath
made
adversity
as
a
morning
dew
upon
his
green
pasture
and
a
wick
for
his
lamp
which
lighteth
earth
and
heaven
set
thine
heart
towards
him
who
is
the
kaaba
of
god
the
help
in
peril
the
and
raise
thou
thine
hands
with
such
firm
conviction
as
shall
cause
the
hands
of
all
created
things
to
be
lifted
up
towards
the
heaven
of
the
grace
of
god
the
lord
of
all
worlds
turn
then
thy
face
towards
him
in
such
wise
that
the
faces
of
all
beings
will
turn
in
the
direction
of
his
shining
and
luminous
horizon
and
say
thou
seest
me
o
my
lord
with
my
face
turned
towards
the
heaven
of
thy
bounty
and
the
ocean
of
thy
favor
withdrawn
from
all
else
beside
thee
i
ask
of
thee
by
the
splendors
of
the
sun
of
thy
revelation
on
sinai
and
the
effulgences
of
the
orb
of
thy
grace
which
shineth
from
the
horizon
of
thy
name
the
to
grant
me
thy
pardon
and
to
have
mercy
upon
me
write
down
then
for
me
with
thy
pen
of
glory
that
which
will
exalt
me
through
thy
name
in
the
world
of
creation
aid
me
o
my
lord
to
set
myself
towards
thee
and
to
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
thy
loved
ones
whom
the
powers
of
the
earth
have
failed
to
weaken
and
the
dominion
of
the
nations
has
been
powerless
to
withhold
from
thee
and
who
advancing
towards
thee
have
said
god
is
our
lord
the
lord
of
all
who
are
in
heaven
and
all
who
are
on
earth
o
verily
i
say
the
seal
of
the
choice
wine
hath
in
the
name
of
him
who
is
the
been
broken
withhold
not
thyself
therefrom
this
wronged
one
speaketh
wholly
for
the
sake
of
god
thou
too
shouldst
likewise
for
the
sake
of
god
meditate
upon
those
things
that
have
been
sent
down
and
manifested
that
haply
thou
mayest
on
this
blessed
day
take
thy
portion
of
the
liberal
effusions
of
him
who
is
truly
the
and
mayest
not
remain
deprived
thereof
this
indeed
would
not
be
hard
for
god
adam
was
raised
up
through
the
word
of
god
to
the
heavenly
throne
and
a
mere
fisherman
was
made
the
repository
of
divine
wisdom
and
the
shepherd
became
a
prince
of
the
nations
this
day
o
hath
never
been
nor
is
it
now
the
day
whereon
arts
and
sciences
can
be
regarded
as
a
true
standard
for
men
since
it
hath
been
recognized
that
he
who
was
wholly
unversed
in
any
of
them
hath
ascended
the
throne
of
purest
gold
and
occupied
the
seat
of
honor
in
the
council
of
knowledge
whilst
the
acknowledged
exponent
and
repository
of
these
arts
and
sciences
remained
utterly
deprived
by
arts
and
sciences
is
meant
those
which
begin
with
words
and
end
with
words
such
arts
and
sciences
however
as
are
productive
of
good
results
and
bring
forth
their
fruit
and
are
conducive
to
the
and
tranquility
of
men
have
been
and
will
remain
acceptable
before
god
wert
thou
to
give
ear
to
my
voice
thou
wouldst
cast
away
all
thy
possessions
and
wouldst
set
thy
face
towards
the
spot
wherein
the
ocean
of
wisdom
and
of
utterance
hath
surged
and
the
sweet
savors
of
the
of
thy
lord
the
compassionate
have
wafted
we
deem
it
advisable
in
this
connection
to
recount
briefly
some
past
events
that
perchance
they
may
be
the
means
of
vindicating
the
cause
of
equity
and
justice
at
the
time
when
his
majesty
the
may
god
his
lord
the
most
merciful
aid
him
through
his
strengthening
grace
was
planning
a
journey
to
iṣfáhán
this
wronged
one
having
obtained
his
permission
visited
the
holy
and
luminous
of
the
imáms
may
the
blessings
of
god
be
upon
them
upon
our
return
we
proceeded
to
lavásán
on
account
of
the
excessive
heat
prevailing
in
the
capital
following
our
departure
there
occurred
the
attempt
upon
the
life
of
his
majesty
may
god
exalted
and
glorified
be
he
assist
him
those
days
were
troublous
days
and
the
fires
of
hatred
burned
high
many
were
arrested
among
them
this
wronged
one
by
the
righteousness
of
god
we
were
in
no
wise
connected
with
that
evil
deed
and
our
innocence
was
indisputably
established
by
the
tribunals
nevertheless
they
apprehended
us
and
from
níyávarán
which
was
then
the
residence
of
his
majesty
conducted
us
on
foot
and
in
chains
with
bared
head
and
bare
feet
to
the
dungeon
of
ṭihrán
a
brutal
man
accompanying
us
on
horseback
snatched
off
our
hat
whilst
we
were
being
hurried
along
by
a
troop
of
executioners
and
officials
we
were
consigned
for
four
months
to
a
place
foul
beyond
comparison
as
to
the
dungeon
in
which
this
wronged
one
and
others
similarly
wronged
were
confined
a
dark
and
narrow
pit
were
preferable
upon
our
arrival
we
were
first
conducted
along
a
corridor
from
whence
we
descended
three
steep
flights
of
stairs
to
the
place
of
confinement
assigned
to
us
the
dungeon
was
wrapped
in
thick
darkness
and
our
fellow
prisoners
numbered
nearly
a
hundred
and
fifty
souls
thieves
assassins
and
highwaymen
though
crowded
it
had
no
other
outlet
than
the
passage
by
which
we
entered
no
pen
can
depict
that
place
nor
any
tongue
describe
its
loathsome
smell
most
of
these
men
had
neither
clothes
nor
bedding
to
lie
on
god
alone
knoweth
what
befell
us
in
that
most
and
gloomy
place
day
and
night
while
confined
in
that
dungeon
we
meditated
upon
the
deeds
the
condition
and
the
conduct
of
the
bábís
wondering
what
could
have
led
a
people
so
so
noble
and
of
such
intelligence
to
perpetrate
such
an
audacious
and
outrageous
act
against
the
person
of
his
majesty
this
wronged
one
thereupon
decided
to
arise
after
his
release
from
prison
and
undertake
with
the
utmost
vigor
the
task
of
regenerating
this
people
one
night
in
a
dream
these
exalted
words
were
heard
on
every
side
verily
we
shall
render
thee
victorious
by
thyself
and
by
thy
pen
grieve
thou
not
for
that
which
hath
befallen
thee
neither
be
thou
afraid
for
thou
art
in
safety
erelong
will
god
raise
up
the
treasures
of
the
who
will
aid
thee
through
thyself
and
through
thy
name
wherewith
god
hath
revived
the
hearts
of
such
as
have
recognized
him
and
when
this
wronged
one
went
forth
out
of
his
prison
we
journeyed
in
pursuance
of
the
order
of
his
majesty
the
god
exalted
be
he
protect
iráq
escorted
by
officers
in
the
service
of
the
esteemed
and
honored
governments
of
persia
and
russia
after
our
arrival
we
revealed
as
a
copious
rain
by
the
aid
of
god
and
his
divine
grace
and
mercy
our
verses
and
sent
them
to
various
parts
of
the
world
we
exhorted
all
men
and
particularly
this
people
through
our
wise
counsels
and
loving
admonitions
and
forbade
them
to
engage
in
sedition
quarrels
disputes
and
conflict
as
a
result
of
this
and
by
the
grace
of
god
waywardness
and
folly
were
changed
into
piety
and
understanding
and
weapons
converted
into
instruments
of
peace
during
the
days
i
lay
in
the
prison
of
ṭihrán
though
the
galling
weight
of
the
chains
and
the
air
allowed
me
but
little
sleep
still
in
those
infrequent
moments
of
slumber
i
felt
as
if
something
flowed
from
the
crown
of
my
head
over
my
breast
even
as
a
mighty
torrent
that
precipitateth
itself
upon
the
earth
from
the
summit
of
a
lofty
mountain
every
limb
of
my
body
would
as
a
result
be
set
afire
at
such
moments
my
tongue
recited
what
no
man
could
bear
to
hear
we
shall
herewith
cite
a
few
passages
from
tablets
specifically
revealed
to
this
people
so
that
every
one
may
know
of
a
certainty
that
this
wronged
one
hath
acted
in
a
manner
which
hath
been
pleasing
and
acceptable
unto
men
endued
with
insight
and
unto
such
as
are
the
exponents
of
justice
and
equity
o
ye
friends
of
god
in
his
cities
and
his
loved
ones
in
his
lands
this
wronged
one
enjoineth
on
you
honesty
and
piety
blessed
the
city
that
shineth
by
their
light
through
them
man
is
exalted
and
the
door
of
security
is
unlocked
before
the
face
of
all
creation
happy
the
man
that
cleaveth
fast
unto
them
and
recognizeth
their
virtue
and
woe
betide
him
that
denieth
their
station
and
in
another
connection
these
words
were
revealed
we
enjoin
the
servants
of
god
and
his
handmaidens
to
be
pure
and
to
fear
god
that
they
may
shake
off
the
slumber
of
their
corrupt
desires
and
turn
toward
god
the
maker
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
earth
thus
have
we
commanded
the
faithful
when
the
daystar
of
the
world
shone
forth
from
the
horizon
of
iráq
my
imprisonment
doeth
me
no
harm
neither
the
tribulations
i
suffer
nor
the
things
that
have
befallen
me
at
the
hands
of
my
oppressors
that
which
harmeth
me
is
the
conduct
of
those
who
though
they
bear
my
name
yet
commit
that
which
maketh
my
heart
and
my
pen
to
lament
they
that
spread
disorder
in
the
land
and
lay
hands
on
the
property
of
others
and
enter
a
house
without
leave
of
its
owner
we
verily
are
clear
of
them
unless
they
repent
and
return
unto
god
the
the
most
merciful
and
in
another
connection
o
peoples
of
the
earth
haste
ye
to
do
the
pleasure
of
god
and
war
ye
valiantly
as
it
behooveth
you
to
war
for
the
sake
of
proclaiming
his
resistless
and
immovable
cause
we
have
decreed
that
war
shall
be
waged
in
the
path
of
god
with
the
armies
of
wisdom
and
utterance
and
of
a
goodly
character
and
praiseworthy
deeds
thus
hath
it
been
decided
by
him
who
is
the
the
almighty
there
is
no
glory
for
him
that
committeth
disorder
on
the
earth
after
it
hath
been
made

and
be
not

verily
have
come
to
unite

together
all
that
dwell
on
earth
unto
this
beareth
witness
what
the
ocean
of
mine
utterance
hath
revealed
amongst
men
and

most
of
the
people
have
gone
astray
if
anyone

you
or
trouble

you
in
the
path
of
god
be
patient

put
your
trust
in
him

and

commandeth
you
the
king
of

who
is
manifest
in
his
most
great
name
he
verily
is
the
ordainer

lest
ye

of
your
tongue
from
the
scabbard
of

for
therewith
ye

these
sublime
words
have
in
this
day
been
heard
from
the
beyond
which
there
is
no
passing
i
belong
to
him
that
loveth
me

away
the
things
forbidden

this
is
the
day
to
make
mention

to
celebrate
his
praise
and
to

him
deprive
not
yourselves
thereof
ye
are
the
letters
of

are
the
saplings
which
the

is
the
time
for
you
to
put
forth
your

your
fruit
the
fruits
of
the
tree
of
man
have
ever
been

are
goodly

a
praiseworthy
character
withhold
not
these
fruits
from
the
heedless
if
they
be
accepted
your
end
is
attained
and
the
purpose
of
life
achieved
if
not
leave
them
in
their
pastime
of
vain
disputes
strive
o
people
of
god
that
haply
the
hearts
of
the
divers
kindreds
of
the
earth
may
through
the
waters
of
your
forbearance
and
be
cleansed
and
sanctified
from
animosity
and
hatred
and
be
made
worthy
and
befitting
recipients
of
the
splendors
of
the
sun
of
truth
in
the
fourth
splendor
of
the
tablet
of
splendors
we
have
mentioned
every
cause
needeth
a
helper
in
this
revelation
the
hosts
which
can
render
it
victorious
are
the
hosts
of
praiseworthy
deeds
and
upright
character
the
leader
and
commander
of
these
hosts
hath
ever
been
the
fear
of
god
a
fear
that
encompasseth
all
things
and
reigneth
over
all
things
in
the
third
tajallí
effulgence
of
the
book
of
tajallíyát
book
of
effulgences
we
have
mentioned
arts
crafts
and
sciences
uplift
the
world
of
being
and
are
conducive
to
its
exaltation
knowledge
is
as
wings
to
man
s
life
and
a
ladder
for
his
ascent
its
acquisition
is
incumbent
upon
everyone
the
knowledge
of
such
sciences
however
should
be
acquired
as
can
profit
the
peoples
of
the
earth
and
not
those
which
begin
with
words
and
end
with
words
great
indeed
is
the
claim
of
scientists
and
craftsmen
on
the
peoples
of
the
world
unto
this
beareth
witness
the
mother
book
in
this
conspicuous
station
in
truth
knowledge
is
a
veritable
treasure
for
man
and
a
source
of
glory
of
bounty
of
joy
of
exaltation
of
cheer
and
gladness
unto
him
happy
the
man
that
cleaveth
unto
it
and
woe
betide
the
heedless
it
is
incumbent
upon
thee
to
summon
the
people
under
all
conditions
to
whatever
will
cause
them
to
show
forth
spiritual
characteristics
and
goodly
deeds
so
that
all
may
become
aware
of
that
which
is
the
cause
of
human
upliftment
and
may
with
the
utmost
endeavor
direct
themselves
towards
the
most
sublime
station
and
the
pinnacle
of
glory
the
fear
of
god
hath
ever
been
the
prime
factor
in
the
education
of
his
creatures
well
is
it
with
them
that
have
attained
thereunto
the
first
word
which
the
abhá
pen
hath
revealed
and
inscribed
on
the
first
leaf
of
paradise
is
this
verily
i
say
the
fear
of
god
hath
ever
been
a
sure
defence
and
a
safe
stronghold
for
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
it
is
the
chief
cause
of
the
protection
of
mankind
and
the
supreme
instrument
for
its
preservation
indeed
there
existeth
in
man
a
faculty
which
deterreth
him
from
and
guardeth
him
against
whatever
is
unworthy
and
unseemly
and
which
is
known
as
his
sense
of
shame
this
however
is
confined
to
but
a
few
all
have
not
possessed
and
do
not
possess
it
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
kings
and
the
spiritual
leaders
of
the
world
to
lay
fast
hold
on
religion
inasmuch
as
through
it
the
fear
of
god
is
instilled
in
all
else
but
him
the
second
word
we
have
recorded
on
the
second
leaf
of
paradise
is
the
following
the
pen
of
the
divine
expounder
exhorteth
at
this
moment
the
manifestations
of
authority
and
the
sources
of
power
namely
the
kings
and
rulers
of
the
god
assist
enjoineth
them
to
uphold
the
cause
of
religion
and
to
cleave
unto
it
religion
is
verily
the
chief
instrument
for
the
establishment
of
order
in
the
world
and
of
tranquillity
amongst
its
peoples
the
weakening
of
the
pillars
of
religion
hath
strengthened
the
foolish
and
emboldened
them
and
made
them
more
arrogant
verily
i
say
the
greater
the
decline
of
religion
the
more
grievous
the
waywardness
of
the
ungodly
this
can
not
but
lead
in
the
end
to
chaos
and
confusion
hear
me
o
men
of
insight
and
be
warned
ye
who
are
endued
with
discernment
it
is
our
hope
that
thou
wilt
hear
with
attentive
ears
the
things
we
have
mentioned
unto
thee
that
perchance
thou
mayest
turn
men
away
from
the
things
they
possess
to
the
things
that
god
possesseth
we
entreat
god
to
deliver
the
light
of
equity
and
the
sun
of
justice
from
the
thick
clouds
of
waywardness
and
cause
them
to
shine
forth
upon
men
no
light
can
compare
with
the
light
of
justice
the
establishment
of
order
in
the
world
and
the
tranquillity
of
the
nations
depend
upon
it
in
the
book
of
utterance
these
exalted
words
have
been
written
down
and
recorded
say
o
friends
strive
that
haply
the
tribulations
suffered
by
this
wronged
one
and
by
you
in
the
path
of
god
may
not
prove
to
have
been
in
vain
cling
ye
to
the
hem
of
virtue
and
hold
fast
to
the
cord
of
trustworthiness
and
piety
concern
yourselves
with
the
things
that
benefit
mankind
and
not
with
your
corrupt
and
selfish
desires
o
ye
followers
of
this
wronged
one
ye
are
the
shepherds
of
mankind
liberate
ye
your
flocks
from
the
wolves
of
evil
passions
and
desires
and
adorn
them
with
the
ornament
of
the
fear
of
god
this
is
the
firm
commandment
which
hath
at
this
moment
flowed
out
from
the
pen
of
him
who
is
the
ancient
of
days
by
the
righteousness
of
god
the
sword
of
a
virtuous
character
and
upright
conduct
is
sharper
than
blades
of
steel
the
voice
of
the
true
faith
calleth
aloud
at
this
moment
and
saith
o
people
verily
the
day
is
come
and
my
lord
hath
made
me
to
shine
forth
with
a
light
whose
splendor
hath
eclipsed
the
suns
of
utterance
fear
ye
the
merciful
and
be
not
of
them
that
have
gone
astray
the
third
word
we
have
recorded
on
the
third
leaf
of
paradise
is
this
o
son
of
man
if
thine
eyes
be
turned
towards
mercy
forsake
the
things
that
profit
thee
and
cleave
unto
that
which
will
profit
mankind
and
if
thine
eyes
be
turned
towards
justice
choose
thou
for
thy
neighbor
that
which
thou
choosest
for
thyself
humility
exalteth
man
to
the
heaven
of
glory
and
power
whilst
pride
abaseth
him
to
the
depths
of
wretchedness
and
degradation
great
is
the
day
and
mighty
the
call
in
one
of
our
tablets
we
have
revealed
these
exalted
words
were
the
world
of
the
spirit
to
be
wholly
converted
into
the
sense
of
hearing
it
could
then
claim
to
be
worthy
to
hearken
unto
the
voice
that
calleth
from
the
supreme
horizon
for
otherwise
these
ears
that
are
defiled
with
lying
tales
have
never
been
nor
are
they
now
fit
to
hear
well
is
it
with
them
that
hearken
and
woe
betide
the
wayward
we
pray
be
his
cherish
the
hope
that
he
may
graciously
assist
the
manifestations
of
affluence
and
power
and
the
daysprings
of
sovereignty
and
glory
the
kings
of
the
god
aid
them
through
his
strengthening
establish
the
lesser
peace
this
indeed
is
the
greatest
means
for
insuring
the
tranquillity
of
the
nations
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
sovereigns
of
the
god
assist
to
hold
fast
unto
this
peace
which
is
the
chief
instrument
for
the
protection
of
all
mankind
it
is
our
hope
that
they
will
arise
to
achieve
what
will
be
conducive
to
the
of
man
it
is
their
duty
to
convene
an
assembly
which
either
they
themselves
or
their
ministers
will
attend
and
to
enforce
whatever
measures
are
required
to
establish
unity
and
concord
amongst
men
they
must
put
away
the
weapons
of
war
and
turn
to
the
instruments
of
universal
reconstruction
should
one
king
rise
up
against
another
all
the
other
kings
must
arise
to
deter
him
arms
and
armaments
will
then
be
no
more
needed
beyond
that
which
is
necessary
to
insure
the
internal
security
of
their
respective
countries
if
they
attain
unto
this
blessing
the
people
of
each
nation
will
pursue
with
tranquillity
and
contentment
their
own
occupations
and
the
groanings
and
lamentations
of
most
men
would
be
silenced
we
beseech
god
to
aid
them
to
do
his
will
and
pleasure
he
verily
is
the
lord
of
the
throne
on
high
and
of
earth
below
and
the
lord
of
this
world
and
of
the
world
to
come
it
would
be
preferable
and
more
fitting
that
the
highly
honored
kings
themselves
should
attend
such
an
assembly
and
proclaim
their
edicts
any
king
who
will
arise
and
carry
out
this
task
he
verily
will
in
the
sight
of
god
become
the
cynosure
of
all
kings
happy
is
he
and
great
is
his
blessedness
in
this
land
every
time
men
are
conscripted
for
the
army
a
great
terror
seizeth
the
people
every
nation
augmenteth
each
year
its
forces
for
their
ministers
of
war
are
insatiable
in
their
desire
to
add
fresh
recruits
to
their
battalions
we
have
learned
that
the
government
of
god
assist
likewise
decided
to
reinforce
their
army
in
the
opinion
of
this
wronged
one
a
force
of
one
hundred
thousand
and
men
would
suffice
we
hope
that
thou
wilt
cause
the
light
of
justice
to
shine
more
brightly
by
the
righteousness
of
god
justice
is
a
powerful
force
it
is
above
all
else
the
conqueror
of
the
citadels
of
the
hearts
and
souls
of
men
and
the
revealer

of

there
lieth
concealed
a
knowledge
which
when
applied
will
largely

not
wholly
eliminate

this

however
should

as
it
will
greatly
aid

whatever

should
the

there
would
flow
out
from
the
pen
of
the
divine
expounder
a
lengthy
exposition
of
that
which
hath
been
mentioned
and
there
would
be

in
the
field
of

what
would

which

pleasing

acceptable
unto

in
these
days
enemies
have
compassed
us
about
and
the
fire
of
hatred
is
kindled
o
peoples
of
the
earth
by
my
life
and
by
your
own
this
wronged
one
hath
never
had
nor
hath
he
now
any
desire
for
leadership
mine
aim
hath
ever
been
and
still
is
to
suppress
whatever
is
the
cause
of
contention
amidst
the
peoples
of
the

and
of
separation
amongst
the

that
all
men
may
be
sanctified
from
every
earthly
attachment
and
be
set
free
to
occupy
themselves
with
their
own
interests
we
entreat
our
loved
ones
not
to
besmirch
the
hem
of
our
raiment
with
the
dust
of
falsehood
neither
to
allow
references
to
what
they
have
regarded
as
miracles
and
prodigies
to
debase
our
rank
and
station
or
to
mar
the
purity
and
sanctity
of
our
name
gracious
god
this
is
the
day
whereon
the
wise
should
seek
the
advice
of
this
wronged
one
and
ask
him
who
is
the
truth
what
things
are
conducive
to
the
glory
and
tranquillity
of
men
and
yet
all
are
earnestly
striving
to
put
out
this
glorious
and
shining
light
and
are
diligently
seeking
either
to
establish
our
guilt
or
to
voice
their
protest
against
us
matters
have
come
to
such
a
pass
that
the
conduct
of
this
wronged
one
hath
in
every
way
been
grossly
misrepresented
and
in
a
manner
which
it
would
be
unseemly
to
mention
one
of
our
friends
hath
reported
that
among
the
residents
of
the
great
city
constantinople
he
had
heard
with
the
greatest
regret
someone
state
that
each
year
a
sum
of
fifty
thousand
tumans
was
being
despatched
from
his
native
land
to
akká
it
hath
not
however
been
made
clear
who
had
disbursed
the
sum
nor
through
whose
hands
it
had
passed
briefly
this
wronged
one
hath
in
the
face
of
all
that
hath
befallen
him
at
their
hands
and
all
that
hath
been
said
of
him
endured
patiently
and
held
his
peace
inasmuch
as
it
is
our
purpose
through
the
loving
providence
of
be
his
his
surpassing
mercy
to
abolish
through
the
force
of
our
utterance
all
disputes
war
and
bloodshed
from
the
face
of
the
earth
under
all
conditions
we
have
in
spite
of
what
they
have
said
endured
with
seemly
patience
and
have
left
them
to
god
in
answer
to
this
particular
imputation
however
we
have
replied
that
if
that
which
he
affirmeth
be
true
it
behooveth
him
to
be
thankful
to
him
who
is
the
lord
of
all
being
and
the
king
of
the
seen
and
unseen
for
having
raised
up
in
persia
one
who
though
a
prisoner
and
with
none
to
help
and
assist
him
hath
succeeded
in
establishing
his
ascendency
over
that
land
and
in
drawing
from
it
a
yearly
revenue
such
an
achievement
should
be
praised
rather
than
censured
if
he
be
of
them
that
judge
equitably
should
anyone
seek
to
be
acquainted
with
the
condition
of
this
wronged
one
let
him
be
told
that
these
captives
whom
the
world
hath
persecuted
and
the
nations
wronged
have
for
days
and
nights
been
entirely
denied
the
barest
means
of
subsistence
we
are
loth
to
mention
such
things
neither
have
we
had
nor
do
we
have
now
any
desire
to
complain
against
our
accuser
within
the
walls
of
this
prison
a
highly
esteemed
man
was
for
some
time
obliged
to
break
stones
that
he
might
earn
a
living
whilst
others
had
at
times
to
nourish
themselves
with
that
divine
sustenance
which
is
hunger
we
entreat
and
glorified
be
aid
all
men
to
be
just
and
and
to
graciously
assist
them
to
repent
and
return
unto
him
he
verily
heareth
and
is
ready
to
answer
glorified
art
thou
o
lord
my
god
thou
seest
what
hath
befallen
this
wronged
one
at
the
hands
of
them
that
have
not
associated
with
me
and
who
have
arisen
to
harm
and
abase
me
in
a
manner
which
no
pen
can
describe
nor

recount
nor
can
any
tablet
sustain
its
weight
thou
hearest
the
cry
of
mine
heart
and
the
groaning
of
mine
inmost
being
and
the
things
that
have
befallen
thy
trusted
ones
in
thy
cities
and
thy
chosen
ones
in
thy
land
at
the
hands
of
such
as
have
broken
thy
covenant
and
thy
testament
i
beseech
thee
o
my
lord
by
the
sighs
of
thy
lovers
throughout
the
world
and
by
their
lamentation
in
their
remoteness
from
the
court
of
thy
presence
and
by
the
blood
that
hath
been
shed
for
love
of
thee
and
by
the
hearts
that
have
melted
in
thy
path
to
protect
thy
loved

from
the
cruelty
of
such
as
have
remained
unaware

the
mysteries
of
thy

them
o
my
lord
by
thy
power
that
hath
prevailed
over
all
things
and
aid
them
to
be
patient
and

there
but
thee
the
generous
the
lord
of
grace
abounding
in
these
days
there
are
some
who
far
from
being
just
and
have
assaulted
me
with
the
sword
of
hatred
and
the
spear
of
enmity
forgetting
that
it
behooveth
every
person
to
succor
him
whom
the
world
hath
cast
away
and
the
nations
abandoned
and
to
lay
hold
on
piety
and
righteousness
most
men
have
until
now
failed
to
discover
the
purpose
of
this
wronged
one
nor
have
they
known
the
reason
for
which
he
hath
been
willing
to
endure
countless
afflictions
meanwhile
the
voice
of
mine
heart
crieth
out
these
words
o
that
my
people

of

above
the
horizon
of

wronged
one
unto
this
beareth
witness
every
man
of
judgment
of
discernment
of
insight
and
understanding
whilst
afflicted
with
trials
he
held
fast
unto
the
cord
of
patience
and
fortitude
and
was
satisfied
with
the
things
which
have
befallen
him
at
the
hands
of
his
enemies
and
was
crying
out
i
have
renounced
my
desire
for
thy
desire
o

for
the

may
sacrifice
it
in
thy
path
thou
seest
and
knowest
o
my
lord
that
those
whom
we
asked
to
be
fair
and
just
have
unjustly
and
cruelly
risen
up
against

openly
they
were
with

secretly
they
assisted
my
foes
who
have
arisen
to
dishonor
me
o

my

i
testify
that
thou
hast
created
thy
servants
to

thy

thine
enemies
i

thee
by
thy
cause
that
hath
encompassed
the
world
of
being
and
by
thy
name
wherewith
thou
hast
subjected
the
seen

to
adorn
the
peoples
of
the
earth
with
the
light
of
thy
justice
and
to
illuminate
their

with
the
brightness
of
thy
knowledge
i
am
o
my

thy
servant
and
the
son
of
thy

bear
witness
unto
thy

of
thine

thou
beholdest
o
my

thy
trusted

at
the
mercy
of
the
treacherous
among
thy
creatures
and
the
calumniators
amidst
thy
people
thou
knowest
what
hath
befallen
us
at
the
hands
of
them
whom
thou
knowest
better
than
we
know
them
they
have
committed
what
hath
torn
the
veil
from
such
of
thy
creatures
as
are
nigh
unto
thee
i
beseech
thee
to
assist
them
to
obtain
that
which
hath
escaped
them
in
the
days
of
the
of
thy
revelation
and
the
dayspring
of
thine
inspiration
potent
art
thou
to
do
what
pleaseth
thee
and
in
thy
grasp
are
the
reins
of
all
that
is
in

and
all
that

by
the
righteousness
of

attained
unto

who
hath
manifested

and
sent
me
down
this

the
day
whereon

smiled
at
him
who
conversed

at
its

and
the

at

and
be

him
withhold

of

him
who
is
the
mighty
the
peerless
we
have
under
all
circumstances
enjoined
on
men
what
is
right
and
forbidden
what
is
wrong
he
who
is
the
lord
of

witness
that
this
wronged
one
hath
besought
from
god
for
his
creatures
whatever
is
conducive
to
unity
and
harmony
fellowship
and
concord
by
the
righteousness
of

this

he
verily
hath
revealed
that
which
he
desired
he
truly
is
the
lord
of
strength
the
unrestrained
we
once
again
refer
unto
some
of
the
sublime
words
revealed
in
the
tablet
to
his
majesty
the
so
that
thou
mayest
know
of
a
certainty
that
whatever
hath
been
mentioned
hath
come
from
god
o
king
i
was
but
a
man
like
others
asleep
upon
my
couch
when
lo
the
breezes
of
the
were
wafted
over
me
and
taught
me
the
knowledge
of
all
that
hath
been
this
thing
is
not
from
me
but
from
one
who
is
almighty
and
and
he
bade
me
lift
up
my
voice
between
earth
and
heaven
and
for
this
there
befell
me
what
hath
caused
the
tears
of
every
man
of
understanding
to
flow
the
learning
current
amongst
men
i
studied
not
their
schools
i
entered

of
the
city
wherein
i
dwelt
that
thou
mayest
be
well
assured
that
i
am
not
of
them
who
speak
falsely
this
is
but
a
leaf

the
winds
of
the

of
thy

the
almighty
the
have
stirred
can
it
be
still
when
the
tempestuous
winds
are
blowing

by
him
who

of
all

move
it
as

as
nothing

him
who
is
the
his
summons

reached
me
and
caused
me
to

with

concerning
what

without
proof

without

thee
for

thine

there
is
no

uttereth
praises
to
god
the
maker
of
all
names
and
the
creator
of
earth
and

thou
wouldst
attain
unto
a
station
from
which
thou
wouldst
behold
in
the
world
of
being
naught
save
the
effulgence
of
the
adored
one
and
wouldst
regard
thy
sovereignty
as
the
most
contemptible
of
thy
possessions
abandoning
it
to
whosoever
might
desire
it
and
setting
thy
face
toward
the
horizon
aglow
with
the
light
of
his
countenance
neither
wouldst
thou
ever
be
willing
to
bear
the
burden
of
dominion
save
for
the
purpose
of
helping
thy
lord
the
exalted
the
most
high
then
would
the
concourse

high
bless
thee
o
how
excellent
is
this
most
sublime
station
couldst
thou
ascend
thereunto
through
the
power
of
a
sovereignty
recognized
as
derived
from
the
name
of

of
him
who
is
the
desire
of
all
men
hath
purified
himself
from
idle
fancies
and
vain
imaginings
and
torn
away
in
the
name
of
the
the
most
high
the
veils
of
doubt
and
renounced
the
world
and
all
that
is
therein
and
directed
himself
towards
the
most
great
prison
o
no
breeze
can
compare
with
the
breezes
of
divine
revelation
whilst
the
word
which
is
uttered
by
god
shineth
and
flasheth
as
the
sun
amidst
the
books
of
men
happy
the
man
that
hath
discovered
it
and
recognized
it
and
said
praised
be
thou
who
art
the
desire
of
the
world
and
thanks
be
to
thee
o
of
the
hearts
of
such
as
are
devoted
to
thee
men
have
failed
to
perceive
our
purpose
in
the
references
we
have
made
to
divinity
and
godhood
were
they
to
apprehend
it
they
would
arise
from
their
places
and
cry
out
we
verily
ask
pardon
of
god
the
seal
of
the
the
souls
of
all
else
but
him
be
offered
up
for
his
manifold
are
our
relationships
with
god
at
one
time
we
are
he
himself
and
he
is
we
ourself
at
another
he
is
that
he
is
and
we
are
that
we
are
aside
from
this
why
is
it
that
thou
didst
not
mention
those
other
stations
which
the
abhá
pen
hath
disclosed
the
tongue
of
this
wronged
one
hath
many
a
day
and
night
given
utterance
to
these
sublime
words
o
god
my
god
i
bear
witness
to
thy
unity
and
thy
oneness
and
that
thou
art
god
and
that
there
is
none
other
god
but
thee
thou
hast
everlastingly
been
sanctified
above
the
mention
of
any
one
but
thee
and
the
praise
of
all
else
except
thyself
and
thou
wilt
everlastingly
continue
to
be
the
same
as
thou
wast
from
the
beginning
and
hast
ever
been
i
beseech
thee
o
king
of
eternity
by
the
most
great
name
and
by
the
effulgences
of
the
daystar
of
thy
revelation
upon
the
sinai
of
utterance
and
by
the
billows
of
the
ocean
of
thy
knowledge
among
all
created
things
to
graciously
assist
me
in
that
which
will
draw
me
nigh
unto
thee
and
will
detach
me
from
all
except
thee
by
thy
glory
o
lord
of
all
being
and
the
desire
of
all
creation
i
would
love
to
lay
my
face
upon
every
single
spot
of
thine
earth
that
perchance
it
might
be
honored
by
touching
a
spot
ennobled
by
the
footsteps
of
thy
loved
ones
by
the
righteousness
of
god
idle
fancies
have
debarred
men
from
the
horizon
of
certitude
and
vain
imaginings
withheld
them
from
the
choice
sealed
wine
in
truth
i
say
and
for
the
sake
of
god
i
declare
this
servant
this
wronged
one
is
abashed
to
claim
for
himself
any
existence
whatever
how
much
more
those
exalted
grades
of
being
every
man
of
discernment
while
walking
upon
the
earth
feeleth
indeed
abashed
inasmuch
as
he
is
fully
aware
that
the
thing
which
is
the
source
of
his
prosperity
his
wealth
his
might
his
exaltation
his
advancement
and
power
is
as
ordained
by
god
the
very
earth
which
is
trodden
beneath
the
feet
of
all
men
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
whoever
is
cognizant
of
this
truth
is
cleansed
and
sanctified
from
all
pride
arrogance
and
vainglory
whatever
hath
been
said
hath
come
from
god
unto
this
he
verily
hath
borne
and
beareth
now
witness
and
he
in
truth
is
the
the
beseech
god
to
grant
unto
men
hearing
ears
and
sharp
sight
and
dilated
breasts
and
receptive
hearts
that
haply
his
servants
may
attain
unto
their
hearts
desire
and
set
their
faces
towards
their
beloved
troubles
such
as
no
eye
hath
beheld
have
touched
this
wronged
one
in
proclaiming
his
cause
he
in
no
wise
hesitated
addressing
himself
unto
the
kings
and
rulers
of
the
god
exalted
be
he
assist
imparted
unto
them
that
which
is
the
cause
of
the
the
unity
the
harmony
and
the
reconstruction
of
the
world
and
of
the
tranquillity
of
the
nations
among
them
was
napoleon
iii
who
is
reported
to
have
made
a
certain
statement
as
a
result
of
which
we
sent
him
our
tablet
while
in
adrianople
to
this
however
he
did
not
reply
after
our
arrival
in
the
most
great
prison
there
reached
us
a
letter
from
his
minister
the
first
part
of
which
was
in
persian
and
the
latter
in
his
own
handwriting
in
it
he
was
cordial
and
wrote
the
following
i
have
as
requested
by
you
delivered
your
letter
and
until
now
have
received
no
answer
we
have
however
issued
the
necessary
recommendations
to
our
minister
in
constantinople
and
our
consuls
in
those
regions
if
there
be
anything
you
wish
done
inform
us
and
we
will
carry
it
out
from
his
words
it
became
apparent
that
he
understood
the
purpose
of
this
servant
to
have
been
a
request
for
material
assistance
we
therefore
revealed
in
his
napoleon
iii
s
name
verses
in
the
súratu
some
of
which
we
now
quote
that
thou
mayest
know
that
the
cause
of
this
wronged
one
hath
been
revealed
for
the
sake
of
god
and
hath
come
from
him

the
priest
to
ring
the
bells

down
unto
thee
that
thou
mayest
arise
to
remember
god
the
creator
of
earth
and
heaven
in
these
days
when
all
the
tribes
of
the
earth
have
mourned
and
the
foundations
of
the
cities
have
trembled
and
the
dust
of
irreligion
hath
enwrapped
all
men
except
such
as
god

the
was
pleased
to
spare

he
who
is
the
unconditioned

come
in

the
breezes
of

most
merciful
and
unify
the
world

gather
all
men
around

hath
been
sent
down
from
heaven

that
ye
deny
not
the
favor
of
god
after
it
hath
been
sent
down
unto
you

is
this
for
you
than
that
which
ye
possess
for
that
which
is
yours
perisheth
whilst
that
which
is
with
god
endureth

in
truth
ordaineth
what
he
pleaseth
verily
the
breezes
of
forgiveness
have
been
wafted
from
the
direction
of
your
lord

the
praise
of
its
lord
some
have
known
god
and

thus
have
we
set
down
our
decree
in
a
perspicuous
tablet

ear
o
king
unto
the
voice
that
calleth
from
the
fire

hath
turned
towards
you

verily
is
the
face
of
god
amongst
you
and
his
testimony
and
his
guide
unto
you
he
hath
come
to
you
with
signs
which
none
can
the
voice
of
the
burning
bush
is
raised
in
the
midmost
heart
of
the
world
and
the
holy
spirit
calleth
aloud
among
the
nations
lo
the
desired
one
is
come
with
manifest
dominion
o
king
the
stars
of
the
heaven
of
knowledge
have
fallen
they
who
seek
to
establish
the
truth
of
my
cause
through
the
things
they
possess
and
who
make
mention
of
god
in
my
name
and
yet
when
i
came
unto
them
in
my
glory
they
turned
aside
they
indeed
are
of
the
fallen
this
is
truly
that
which
the
spirit
of
god
jesus
christ
hath
announced
when
he
came
with
truth
unto
you
he
with
whom
the
jewish
doctors
disputed
till
at
last
they
perpetrated
what
hath
made
the
holy
spirit
to
lament
and
the
tears
of
them
that
have
near
access
to
god
to
flow
say
o
concourse
of
monks
seclude
not
yourselves
in
your
churches
and
cloisters
come
ye
out
of
them
by
my
leave
and
busy
then
yourselves
with
what
will
profit
you
and
others
thus
commandeth
you
he
who
is
the
lord
of
the
day
of
reckoning
seclude
yourselves
in
the
stronghold
of
my
love
this
truly
is
the
seclusion
that
befitteth
you
could
ye
but
know
it
he
that
secludeth
himself
in
his
house
is
indeed
as
one
dead
it
behooveth
man
to
show
forth
that
which
will
benefit
mankind
he
that
bringeth
forth
no
fruit
is
fit
for
the
fire
thus
admonisheth
you
your
lord
he
verily
is
the
mighty
the
bountiful
enter
ye
into
wedlock
that
after
you
another
may
arise
in
your
stead
we
verily
have
forbidden
you
lechery
and
not
that
which
is
conducive
to
fidelity
have
ye
clung
unto
the
promptings
of
your
nature
and
cast
behind
your
backs
the
statutes
of
god
fear
ye
god
and
be
not
of
the
foolish
but
for
man
who
on
my
earth
would
remember
me
and
how
could
my
attributes
and
my
names
be
revealed
reflect
and
be
not
of
them
that
have
shut
themselves
out
as
by
a
veil
from
him
and
were
of
those
that
are
fast
asleep
he
that
married
not
jesus
christ
could
find
no
place
wherein
to
abide
nor
where
to
lay
his
head
by
reason
of
what
the
hands
of
the
treacherous
had
wrought
his
holiness
consisted
not
in
the
things
ye
have
believed
and
imagined
but
rather
in
the
things
which
belong
unto
us
ask
that
ye
may
be
made
aware
of
his
station
which
hath
been
exalted
above
the
vain
imaginings
of
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
blessed
are
they
that
understand
o
king
we
heard
the
words
thou
didst
utter
in
answer
to
the
czar
of
russia
concerning
the
decision
made
regarding
the
war
crimean
war
thy
lord
verily
knoweth
is
informed
of
all
thou
didst
say
i
lay
asleep
upon
my
couch
when
the
cry
of
the
oppressed
who
were
drowned
in
the
black
sea
wakened
this
is
what
we
heard
thee
say
and
verily
thy
lord
is
witness
unto
what
i
say
we
testify
that
that
which
wakened
thee
was
not
their
cry
but
the
promptings
of
thine
own
passions
for
we
tested
thee
and
found
thee
wanting
comprehend
the
meaning
of
my
words
and
be
thou
of
the
discerning
it
is
not
our
wish
to
address
thee
words
of
condemnation
out
of
regard
for
the
dignity
we
conferred
upon
thee
in
this
mortal
life
we
verily
have
chosen
courtesy
and
made
it
the
true
mark
of
such
as
are
nigh
unto
him
courtesy
is
in
truth
a
raiment
which
fitteth
all
men
whether
young
or
old
well
is
it
with
him
that
adorneth
his
temple
therewith
and
woe
unto
him
who
is
deprived
of
this
great
bounty
hadst
thou
been
sincere
in
thy
words
thou
wouldst
have
not
cast
behind
thy
back
the
book
of
god
when
it
was
sent
unto
thee
by
him
who
is
the
almighty
the
we
have
proved
thee
through
it
and
found
thee
other
than
that
which
thou
didst
profess
arise
and
make
amends
for
that
which
escaped
thee
erelong
the
world
and
all
that
thou
possessest
will
perish
and
the
kingdom
will
remain
unto
god
thy
lord
and
the
lord
of
thy
fathers
of
old
it
behooveth
thee
not
to
conduct
thine
affairs
according
to
the
dictates
of
thy
desires
fear
the
sighs
of
this
wronged
one
and
shield
him
from
the
darts
of
such
as
act
unjustly
for
what
thou
hast
done
thy
kingdom
shall
be
thrown
into
confusion
and
thine
empire
shall
pass
from
thine
hands
as
a
punishment
for
that
which
thou
hast
wrought
then
wilt
thou
know
how
thou
hast
plainly
erred
commotions
shall
seize
all
the
people
in
that
land
unless
thou
arisest
to
help
this
cause
and
followest
him
who
is
the
spirit
of
god
jesus
christ
in
this
the
straight
path
hath
thy
pomp
made
thee
proud
by
my
life
it
shall
not
endure
nay
it
shall
soon
pass
away
unless
thou
holdest
fast
by
this
firm
cord
we
see
abasement
hastening
after
thee
whilst
thou
art
of
the
heedless
it
behooveth
thee
when
thou
hearest
his
voice
calling
from
the
seat
of
glory
to
cast
away
all
that
thou
possessest
and
cry
out
here
am
i
o
lord
of
all
that
is
in
heaven
and
all
that
is
on
earth
o
king
we
were
in
iráq
when
the
hour
of
parting
arrived
at
the
bidding
of
the
king
of
islám
sulṭán
of
turkey
we
set
our
steps
in
his
direction
upon
our
arrival
there
befell
us
at
the
hands
of
the
malicious
that
which
the
books
of
the
world
can
never
adequately
recount
thereupon
the
inmates
of
paradise
and
they
that
dwell
within
the
retreats
of
holiness
lamented
and
yet
the
people
are
wrapped
in
a
thick
veil
and
further
we
have
said
more
grievous
became
our
plight
from
day
to
day
nay
from
hour
to
hour
until
they
took
us
forth
from
our
prison
and
made
us
with
glaring
injustice
enter
the
most
great
prison
and
if
anyone
ask
them
for
what
crime
were
they
imprisoned
they
would
answer
and
say
they
verily
sought
to
supplant
the
faith
with
a
new
religion
if
that
which
is
ancient
be
what
ye
prefer
wherefore
then
have
ye
discarded
that
which
hath
been
set
down
in
the
torah
and
the
evangel
clear
it
up
o
men
by
my
life
there
is
no
place
for
you
to
flee
to
in
this
day
if
this
be
my
crime
then
muḥammad
the
apostle
of
god
committed
it
before
me
and
before
him
he
who
was
the
spirit
of
god
jesus
christ
and
yet
earlier
he
who
conversed
with
god
moses
and
if
my
sin
be
this
that
i
have
exalted
the
word
of
god
and
revealed
his
cause
then
indeed
am
i
the
greatest
of
sinners
such
a
sin
i
will
not
barter
for
the
kingdoms
of
earth
and
heaven
and
further
we
have
said
as
my
tribulations
multiplied
so
did
my
love
for
god
and
for
his
cause
increase
in
such
wise
that
all
that
befell
me
from
the
hosts
of
the
wayward
was
powerless
to
deter
me
from
my
purpose
should
they
hide
me
away
in
the
depths
of
the
earth
yet
would
they
find
me
riding
aloft
on
the
clouds
and
calling
out
unto
god
the
lord
of
strength
and
of
might
i
have
offered
myself
up
in
the
way
of
god
and
i
yearn
after
tribulations
in
my
love
for
him
and
for
the
sake
of
his
good
pleasure
unto
this
bear
witness
the
woes
which
now
afflict
me
the
like
of
which
no
other
man
hath
suffered
every
single
hair
of
mine
head
calleth
out
that
which
the
burning
bush
uttered
on
sinai
and
each
vein
of
my
body
invoketh
god
and
saith
o
would
i
had
been
severed
in
thy
path
so
that
the
world
might
be
quickened
and
all
its
peoples
be
united
thus
hath
it
been
decreed
by
him
who
is
the
the
know
of
a
truth
that
your
subjects
are
god
s
trust
amongst
you
watch
ye
therefore
over
them
as
ye
watch
over
your
own
selves
beware
that
ye
allow
not
wolves
to
become
the
shepherds
of
the
fold
or
pride
and
conceit
to
deter
you
from
turning
unto
the
poor
and
the
desolate
arise
thou
in
my
name
above
the
horizon
of
renunciation
and
set
then
thy
face
towards
the
kingdom
at
the
bidding
of
thy
lord
the
lord
of
strength
and
of
might
and
further
we
have
said
adorn
the
body
of
thy
kingdom
with
the
raiment
of
my
name
and
arise
then
to
teach
my
cause
better
is
this
for
thee
than
that
which
thou
possessest
god
will
thereby
exalt
thy
name
among
all
the
kings
potent
is
he
over
all
things
walk
thou
amongst
men
in
the
name
of
god
and
by
the
power
of
his
might
that
thou
mayest
show
forth
his
signs
amidst
the
peoples
of
the
earth
and
further
we
have
said
doth
it
behoove
you
to
relate
yourselves
to
him
who
is
the
god
of
mercy
and
yet
commit
the
things
which
the
evil
one
hath
committed
nay
by
the
beauty
of
him
who
is
the
could
ye
but
know
it
purge
your
hearts
from
love
of
the
world
and
your
tongues
from
calumny
and
your
limbs
from
whatsoever
may
withhold
you
from
drawing
nigh
unto
god
the
mighty
the
say
by
the
world
is
meant
that
which
turneth
you
aside
from
him
who
is
the
of
revelation
and
inclineth
you
unto
that
which
is
unprofitable
unto
you
verily
the
thing
that
deterreth
you
in
this
day
from
god
is
worldliness
in
its
essence
eschew
it
and
approach
the
most
sublime
vision
this
shining
and
resplendent
seat
shed
not
the
blood
of
anyone
o
people
neither
judge
ye
anyone
unjustly
thus
have
ye
been
commanded
by
him
who
knoweth
who
is
informed
of
all
they
that
commit
disorders
in
the
land
after
it
hath
been
well
ordered
these
indeed
have
outstepped
the
bounds
that
have
been
set
in
the
book
wretched
shall
be
the
abode
of
the
transgressors
and
further
we
have
said
deal
not
treacherously
with
the
substance
of
your
neighbor
be
ye
trustworthy
on
earth
and
withhold
not
from
the
poor
the
things
given
unto
you
by
god
through
his
grace
he
verily
will
bestow
upon
you
the
double
of
what
ye
possess
he
in
truth
is
the
the
most
generous
o
people
of
bahá
subdue
the
citadels
of
men
s
hearts
with
the
swords
of
wisdom
and
of
utterance
they
that
dispute
as
prompted
by
their
desires
are
indeed
wrapped
in
a
palpable
veil
say
the
sword
of
wisdom
is
hotter
than
summer
heat
and
sharper
than
blades
of
steel
if
ye
do
but
understand
draw
it
forth
in
my
name
and
through
the
power
of
my
might
and
conquer
then
with
it
the
cities
of
the
hearts
of
them
that
have
secluded
themselves
in
the
stronghold
of
their
corrupt
desires
thus
biddeth
you
the
pen
of
the
whilst
seated
beneath
the
swords
of
the
wayward
if
ye
become
aware
of
a
sin
committed
by
another
conceal
it
that
god
may
conceal
your
own
sin
he
verily
is
the
concealer
the
lord
of
grace
abounding
o
ye
rich
ones
on
earth
if
ye
encounter
one
who
is
poor
treat
him
not
disdainfully
reflect
upon
that
whereof
ye
were
created
every
one
of
you
was
created
of
a
sorry
germ
and
further
we
have
said
regard
ye
the
world
as
a
man
s
body
which
is
afflicted
with
divers
ailments
and
the
recovery
of
which
dependeth
upon
the
harmonizing
of
all
of
its
component
elements
gather
ye
around
that
which
we
have
prescribed
unto
you
and
walk
not
in
the
ways
of
such
as
create
dissension
meditate
on
the
world
and
the
state
of
its
people
he
for
whose
sake
the
world
was
called
into
being
hath
been
imprisoned
in
the
most
desolate
of
cities
akká
by
reason
of
that
which
the
hands
of
the
wayward
have
wrought
from
the
horizon
of
his
he
summoneth
mankind
unto
the
dayspring
of
god
the
exalted
the
great
exultest
thou
over
the
treasures
thou
dost
possess
knowing
they
shall
perish
rejoicest
thou
in
that
thou
rulest
a
span
of
earth
when
the
whole
world
in
the
estimation
of
the
people
of
bahá
is
worth
as
much
as
the
black
in
the
eye
of
a
dead
ant
abandon
it
unto
such
as
have
set
their
affections
upon
it
and
turn
thou
unto
him
who
is
the
desire
of
the
world
whither
are
gone
the
proud
and
their
palaces
gaze
thou
into
their
tombs
that
thou
mayest
profit
by
this
example
inasmuch
as
we
made
it
a
lesson
unto
every
beholder
were
the
breezes
of
revelation
to
seize
thee
thou
wouldst
flee
the
world
and
turn
unto
the
kingdom
and
wouldst
expend
all
thou
possessest
that
thou
mayest
draw
nigh
unto
this
sublime
vision
we
bade
a
christian
dispatch
this
tablet
and
he
informed
us
that
he
transmitted
both
the
original
and
its
translation
god

almighty

hath
knowledge
of
all
things
one
of
the
sections
of

the
tablet
addressed
to
his
majesty
the
czar
of

exalted
and
glorified
be
him
o

incline
thine
ear
unto
the
voice
of
god
the
king

holy
and
turn
thou
unto
paradise
the
spot
wherein
abideth
he
who
among
the
concourse
on
high
beareth
the
most
excellent
titles
and
who
in
the
kingdom
of
creation
is
called
by
the
name
of
god
the
effulgent
the
beware
that
nothing
deter
thee
from
setting
thy
face
towards
thy
lord
the
compassionate
the
most
merciful
we
verily
have
heard
the
thing
for
which
thou
didst
supplicate
thy
lord
whilst
secretly
communing
with
him
wherefore
the
breeze
of
my
wafted
forth
and
the
sea
of
my
mercy
surged
and
we
answered
thee
in
truth
thy
lord
verily
is
the
the
whilst
i
lay
chained
and
fettered
in
the
prison
of
ṭihrán
one
of
thy
ministers
extended
me
his
aid
wherefore
hath
god
ordained
for
thee
a
station
which
the
knowledge
of
none
can
comprehend
except
his
knowledge
beware
lest
thou
barter
away
this
sublime
station
and
further
we
have
said
he
who
is
the
father
is
come
and
the
son
jesus
christ
in
the
holy
vale
crieth
out
here
am
i
here

whilst

circleth
round

calleth
aloud
the
is

mounted
upon
the
clouds
blessed
is
he
that
draweth
nigh
unto
him
and
woe
betide
them
that
are
far
arise
thou
amongst
men
in
the
name
of
this
cause
and
summon
then
the
nations
unto
god
the
mighty
the
great
be
thou
not
of
them
who
called
upon
god
by
one
of
his
names
but
who
when
he
who
is
the
object
of
all
names
appeared
denied
him
and
turned
aside
from
him
and
in
the
end
pronounced
sentence
against
him
with
manifest
injustice
consider
and
call
thou
to
mind
the
days
whereon
the
spirit
of
god
jesus
christ
appeared
and
herod
gave
judgment
against
him
god
however
aided
him
with
the
hosts
of
the
unseen
and
protected
him
with
truth
and
sent
him
down
unto
another
land
according
to
his
promise
he
verily
ordaineth
what
he
pleaseth
thy
lord
truly
preserveth
whom
he
willeth
be
he
in
the
midst
of
the
seas
or
in
the
maw
of
the
serpent
or
beneath
the
sword
of
the
oppressor
and
further
we
have
said
again
i
say
hearken
unto
my
voice
that
calleth
from
my
prison
that
it
may
acquaint
thee
with
the
things
that
have
befallen
my
beauty
at
the
hands
of
them
that
are
the
manifestations
of
my
glory
and
that
thou
mayest
perceive
how
great
hath
been
my
patience
notwithstanding
my
might
and
how
immense
my
forbearance
notwithstanding
my
power
by
my
life
couldst
thou
but
know
the
things
sent
down
by
my
pen
and
discover
the
treasures
of
my
cause
and
the
pearls
of
my
mysteries
which
lie
hid
in
the
seas
of
my
names
and
in
the
goblets
of
my
words
thou
wouldst
for
longing
after
his
glorious
and
sublime
kingdom
lay
down
thy
life
in
the
path
of
god
know
thou
that
though
my
body
be
beneath
the
swords
of
my
foes
and
my
limbs
be
beset
with
incalculable
afflictions
yet
my
spirit
is
filled
with
a
gladness
with
which
all
the
joys
of
the
earth
can
never
compare
likewise
we
mention
some
verses
from
the
tablet
of
her
majesty
the
queen
queen
victoria
god
exalted
and
glorified
be
he
assist
her
our
purpose
is
that
haply
the
breezes
of
revelation
may
envelop
thee
and
cause
thee
to
arise
wholly
for
the
sake
of
god
and
serve
his
cause
and
that
thou
mayest
transmit
any
of
the
tablets
of
the
kings
which
might
have
remained
undelivered
this
mission
is
a
great
mission
and
this
service
a
great
service
in
those
regions
distinguished
divines
are
numerous
among
whom
are
those
siyyids
who
are
renowned
for
their
eminence
and
distinction
confer
with
them
and
show
them
what
hath
flowed
out
of
the
pen
of
glory
that
haply
they
may
be
graciously
aided
to
better
the
condition
of
the
world
and
improve
the
character
of
peoples
of
different
nations
and
may
through
the
living
waters
of
god
s
counsels
quench
the
hatred
and
the
animosity
which
lie
hid
and
smolder
in
the
hearts
of
men
we
pray
god
that
thou
mayest
be
assisted
therein
and
this
verily
would
not
be
hard
for
him
o
queen
in
london
incline
thine
ear
unto
the
voice
of
thy
lord
the
lord
of
all
mankind
calling
from
the
divine
verily
no
god
is
there
but
me
the
almighty
the
cast
away
all
that
is
on
earth
and
attire
the
head
of
thy
kingdom
with
the
crown
of
the
remembrance
of
thy
lord
the
he
in
truth
hath
come
unto
the
world
in
his
most
great
glory
and
all
that
hath
been
mentioned
in
the
gospel
hath
been
fulfilled
the
land
of
syria
hath
been
honored
by
the
footsteps
of
its
lord
the
lord
of
all
men
and
north
and
south
are
both
inebriated
with
the
wine
of
his
presence
blessed
is
the
man
that
hath
inhaled
the
fragrance
of
the
most
merciful
and
turned
unto
the
of
his
beauty
in
this
resplendent
dawn
the
mosque
of
aqsá
vibrateth
through
the
breezes
of
its
lord

trembleth
at

the
most
high
every
single
stone
of
them
celebrateth
the
praise
of
the
lord
through
this
great
name
and
further
we
said
we
make
mention
of
thee
for
the
sake
of
god
and
desire
that
thy
name
may
be
exalted
through
thy
remembrance
of
god
the
creator
of
earth
and
of
heaven
he
verily
is
witness
unto
that
which
i
say
we
have
been
informed
that
thou
hast
forbidden
the
trading
in
slaves
both
men
and
women
this
verily
is
what
god
hath
enjoined
in
this
wondrous
revelation
god
hath
truly
destined
a
reward
for
thee
because
of
this
he
verily
will
pay
the
doer
of
good
whether
man
or
woman
his
due
recompense
wert
thou
to
follow
what
hath
been
sent
unto
thee
by
him
who
is
the
the
as
to
him
who
turneth
aside
and
swelleth
with
pride
after
that
the
clear
tokens
have
come
unto
him
from
the
revealer
of
signs
his
work
shall
god
bring
to
naught
he
in
truth
hath
power
over
all
things
man
s
actions
are
acceptable
after
his
having
recognized
the
manifestation
he
that
turneth
aside
from
the
true
one
is
indeed
the
most
veiled
amongst
his
creatures
thus
hath
it
been
decreed
by
him
who
is
the
almighty
the
most
powerful
we
have
also
heard
that
thou
hast
entrusted
the
reins
of
counsel
into
the
hands
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
thou
indeed
hast
done
well
for
thereby
the
foundations
of
the
edifice
of
thine
affairs
will
be
strengthened
and
the
hearts
of
all
that
are
beneath
thy
shadow
whether
high
or
low
will
be
tranquillized
it
behooveth
them
however
to
be
trustworthy
among
his
servants
and
to
regard
themselves
as
the
representatives
of
all
that
dwell
on
earth
this
is
what
counselleth
them
in
this
tablet
he
who
is
the
ruler
the
and
if
any
one
of
them
directeth
himself
towards
the
assembly
let
him
turn
his
eyes
unto
the
supreme
horizon
and
say
o
my
god
i
ask
thee
by
thy
most
glorious
name
to
aid
me
in
that
which
will
cause
the
affairs
of
thy
servants
to
prosper
and
thy
cities
to
flourish
thou
indeed
hast
power
over
all
things
blessed
is
he
that
entereth
the
assembly
for
the
sake
of
god
and
judgeth
between
men
with
pure
justice
he
indeed
is
of
the
blissful
o
ye
members
of
assemblies
in
that
land
and
in
other
countries
take
ye
counsel
together
and
let
your
concern
be
only
for
that
which
profiteth
mankind
and
bettereth
the
condition
thereof
if
ye
be
of
them
that
scan
heedfully
regard
the
world
as
the
human
body
which
though
at
its
creation
whole
and
perfect
hath
been
afflicted
through
various
causes
with
grave
disorders
and
maladies
not
for
one
day
did
it
gain
ease
nay
its
sickness
waxed
more
severe
as
it
fell
under
the
treatment
of
ignorant
physicians
who
gave
full
rein
to
their
personal
desires
and
have
erred
grievously
and
if
at
one
time
through
the
care
of
an
able
physician
a
member
of
that
body
was
healed
the
rest
remained
afflicted
as
before
thus
informeth
you
the
the
we
behold
it
in
this
day
at
the
mercy
of
rulers
so
drunk
with
pride
that
they
can
not
discern
clearly
their
own
best
advantage
much
less
recognize
a
revelation
so
bewildering
and
challenging
as
this
and
further
we
have
said
that
which
god
hath
ordained
as
the
sovereign
remedy
and
mightiest
instrument
for
the
healing
of
the
world
is
the
union
of
all
its
peoples
in
one
universal
cause
one
common
faith
this
can
in
no
wise
be
achieved
except
through
the
power
of
a
skilled
an
and
inspired
physician
by
my
life
this
is
the
truth
and
all
else
naught
but
error
each
time
that
most
mighty
instrument
hath
come
and
that
light
shone
forth
from
the
ancient
dayspring
he
was
withheld
by
ignorant
physicians
who
even
as
clouds
interposed
themselves
between
him
and
the
world
it
failed
therefore
to
recover
and
its
sickness
hath
persisted
until
this
day
they
indeed
were
powerless
to
protect
it
or
to
effect
a
cure
whilst
he
who
hath
been
the
manifestation
of
power
amongst
men
was
withheld
from
achieving
his
purpose
by
reason
of
what
the
hands
of
the
ignorant
physicians
have
wrought
consider
these
days
in
which
he
who
is
the
ancient
beauty
hath
come
in
the
most
great
name
that
he
may
quicken
the
world
and
unite
its
peoples
they
however
rose
up
against
him
with
sharpened
swords
and
committed
that
which
caused
the
faithful
spirit
to
lament
until
in
the
end
they
imprisoned
him
in
the
most
desolate
of
cities
and
broke
the
grasp
of
the
faithful
upon
the
hem
of
his
robe
were
anyone
to
tell
them
the
world
reformer
is
come
they
would
answer
and
say
indeed
it
is
proven
that
he
is
a
fomenter
of
discord
and
this
notwithstanding
that
they
have
never
associated
with
him
and
have
perceived
that
he
did
not
seek
for
one
moment
to
protect
himself
at
all
times
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
wicked
doers
at
one
time
they
cast
him
into
prison
at
another
they
banished
him
and
at
yet
another
hurried
him
from
land
to
land
thus
have
they
pronounced
judgment
against
us
and
god
truly
is
aware
of
what
i
say
this
charge
of
fomenting
discord
is
the
same
as
that
imputed
aforetime
by
the
pharaohs
of
egypt
to
him
who
conversed
with
god
moses
read
thou
what
the
hath
revealed
in
the
qur
án
he
be
blessed
and
moreover
we
had
sent
moses
of
old
with
our
signs
and
with
clear
authority
to
pharaoh
and
hamán
and
qarún
and
they
said
sorcerer
impostor
and
when
he
came
to
them
from
our
presence
with
the
truth
they
said
slay
the
sons
of
those
who
believe
as
he
doth
and
save
their
females
alive
but
the
stratagem
of
the
unbelievers
issued
only
in
failure
and
pharaoh
said
let
me
alone
that
i
may
kill
moses
and
let
him
call
upon
his
lord
i
fear
lest
he
change
your
religion
or
cause
disorder
to
show
itself
in
the
and
moses
said
i
take
refuge
with
my
lord
and
your
lord
from
every
proud
one
who
believeth
not
in
the
day
of
men
have
at
all
times
considered
every
world
reformer
a
fomenter
of
discord
and
have
referred
unto
him
in
terms
with
which
all
are
familiar
each
time
the
daystar
of
divine
revelation
shed
its
radiance
from
the
horizon
of
god
s
will
a
great
number
of
men
denied
him
others
turned
aside
from
him
and
still
others
calumniated
him
and
thereby
withheld
the
servants
of
god
from
the
river
of
loving
providence
of
him
who
is
the
king
of
creation
in
like
manner
they
who
in
this
day
have
neither
met
this
wronged
one
nor
associated
with
him
have
said
and
even
now
continue
to
say
the
things
thou
hast
heard
and
hearest
still
say
o
people
the
sun
of
utterance
beameth
forth
in
this
day
above
the
horizon
of
bounty
and
the
radiance
of
the
revelation
of
him
who
spoke
on
sinai
flasheth
and
glisteneth
before
all
religions
purge
and
sanctify
your
breasts
and
your
hearts
and
your
ears
and
your
eyes
with
the
living
waters
of
the
utterance
of
the
and
set
then
your
faces
towards
him
by
the
righteousness
of
god
ye
shall
hear
all
things
proclaim
verily
he
the
true
one
is
come
blessed
are
they
that
judge
with
fairness
and
blessed
they
that
turn
towards
him
among
the
things
they
have
imputed
to
the
divine
moses
are
charges
to
the
falsity
of
which
every
discerning
man
of
knowledge
and
every
wise
and
understanding
heart
will
witness
thou
must
no
doubt
have
read
and
considered
the
verses
which
have
been
sent
down
concerning
him
who
conversed
with
god
he
be
blessed
and
he
said
did
we
not
rear
thee
among
us
when
a
child
and
hast
thou
not
passed
years
of
thy
life
among
us
and
yet
what
a
deed
is
that
which
thou
hast
done
thou
art
one
of
the
he
said
i
did
it
indeed
and
i
was
one
of
those
who
erred
and
i
fled
from
you
because
i
feared
you
but
my
lord
hath
given
me
wisdom
and
hath
made
me
one
of
his
and
elsewhere
he
be
blessed
and
and
he
entered
a
city
at
the
time
when
its
inhabitants
would
not
observe
him
and
found
therein
two
men
fighting
the
one
of
his
own
people
the
other
of
his
enemies
and
he
who
was
of
his
own
people
asked
his
help
against
him
who
was
of
his
enemies
and
moses
smote
him
with
his
fist
and
slew
him
said
he
this
is
a
work
of
satan
for
he
is
an
enemy
a
manifest
he
said
o
my
lord
i
have
sinned
to
mine
own
hurt
forgive
so
god
forgave
him
for
he
is
the
forgiving
the
merciful
he
said
lord
because
thou
hast
showed
me
this
grace
i
will
never
again
be
the
helper
of
the
and
in
the
city
at
noon
he
was
full
of
fear
casting
furtive
glances
round
him
and
lo
the
man
whom
he
had
helped
the
day
before
cried
out
to
him
again
for
help
said
moses
to
him
thou
art
plainly
a
most
depraved
and
when
he
would
have
laid
violent
hands
on
him
who
was
their
common
foe
he
said
to
him
o
moses
dost
thou
desire
to
slay
me
as
thou
slewest
a
man
yesterday
thou
desirest
only
to
become
a
tyrant
in
this
land
and
desirest
not
to
become
a
thine
ears
and
thine
eyes
must
needs
now
be
cleansed
and
sanctified
that
thou
mayest
be
able
to
judge
with
fairness
and
justice
moses
himself
moreover
acknowledged
his
injustice
and
waywardness
and
testified
that
fear
had
seized
him
and
that
he
had
transgressed
and
fled
away
he
asked
be
his
forgive
him
and
he
was
forgiven
o
every
time
god
the
true
be
his
himself
in
the
person
of
his
manifestation
he
came
unto
men
with
the
standard
of
he
doeth
what
he
willeth
and
ordaineth
what
he
pleaseth
none
hath
the
right
to
ask
why
or
wherefore
and
he
that
doth
so
hath
indeed
turned
aside
from
god
the
lord
of
lords
in
the
days
of
every
manifestation
these
things
appear
and
are
evident
likewise
they
have
said
that
about
this
wronged
one
to
the
falsity
of
which
they
who
are
nigh
unto
god
and
are
devoted
to
him
have
borne
and
still
bear
witness
by
the
righteousness
of
god
this
hem
of
his
robe
hath
ever
been
and
remaineth
unsullied
though
many
have
at
the
present
time
purposed
to
besmirch
it
with
their
lying
and
unseemly
calumnies
god
however
knoweth
and
they
know
not
he
who
through
the
might
and
power
of
god
hath
arisen
before
the
face
of
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
and
summoned
the
multitudes
to
the
supreme
horizon
hath
been
repudiated
by
them
and
they
have
clung
instead
unto
such
men
as
have
invariably
withdrawn
themselves
behind
veils
and
curtains
and
busied
themselves
about
their
own
protection
moreover
many
are
now
engaged
in
spreading
lies
and
calumnies
and
have
no
other
intention
than
to
instill
distrust
into
the
hearts
and
souls
of
men
as
soon
as
someone
leaveth
the
great
city
constantinople
to
visit
this
land
they
at
once
telegraph
and
proclaim
that
he
hath
stolen
money
and
fled
to
akká
a
highly
accomplished
learned
and
distinguished
man
visited
in
his
declining
years
the
holy
land
seeking
peace
and
retirement
and
about
him
they
have
written
such
things
as
have
caused
them
who
are
devoted
to
god
and
are
nigh
unto
him
to
sigh
his
excellency
the
late
mírzá
ḥusayn
god
forgive
known
this
wronged
one
and
he
no
doubt
must
have
given
to
the
authorities
a
circumstantial
account
of
the
arrival
of
this
wronged
one
at
the
sublime
porte
and
of
the
things
which
he
said
and
did
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
the
government
official
whose
duty
it
was
to
receive
and
entertain
official
visitors
met
us
and
escorted
us
to
the
place
he
had
been
bidden
to
take
us
in
truth
the
government
showed
these
wronged
ones
the
utmost
kindness
and
consideration
the
following
day
prince
u
accompanied
by
mírzá
safá
acting
as
the
representatives
of
the
late
the
minister
accredited
to
the
imperial
court
came
to
visit
us
others
among
whom
were
several
ministers
of
the
imperial
government
and
including
the
late
kamál
likewise
called
on
us
wholly
reliant
on
god
and
without
any
reference
to
any
need
he
might
have
had
or
to
any
other
matter
this
wronged
one
sojourned
for
a
period
of
four
months
in
that
city
his
actions
were
known
and
evident
unto
all
and
none
can
deny
them
except
such
as
hate
him
and
speak
not
the
truth
he
that
hath
recognized
god
recognizeth
none
other
but
him
we
have
never
liked
nor
like
we
to
make
mention
of
such
things
whenever
high
dignitaries
of
persia
came
to
that
city
constantinople
they
would
exert
themselves
to
the
utmost
soliciting
at
every
door
such
allowances
and
gifts
as
they
might
obtain
this
wronged
one
however
if
he
hath
done
nothing
that
would
redound
to
the
glory
of
persia
hath
at
least
acted
in
a
manner
that
could
in
no
wise
disgrace
it
that
which
was
done
by
his
late
excellency
god
exalt
his
not
actuated
by
his
friendship
towards
this
wronged
one
but
rather
was
prompted
by
his
own
sagacious
judgment
and
by
his
desire
to
accomplish
the
service
he
secretly
contemplated
rendering
his
government
i
testify
that
he
was
so
faithful
in
his
service
to
his
government
that
dishonesty
played
no
part
and
was
held
in
contempt
in
the
domain
of
his
activities
it
was
he
who
was
responsible
for
the
arrival
of
these
wronged
ones
in
the
most
great
prison
akká
as
he
was
faithful
however
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
he
deserveth
our
commendation
this
wronged
one
hath
at
all
times
aimed
and
striven
to
exalt
and
advance
the
interests
of
both
the
government
and
the
people
not
to
elevate
his
own
station
a
number
of
men
have
now
gathered
others
about
them
and
have
arisen
to
dishonor
this
wronged
one
he
nevertheless
beseecheth
and
glorified
be
aid
them
to
return
unto
him
and
assist
them
to
compensate
for
that
which
escaped
them
and
repent
before
the
door
of
his
bounty
he
verily
is
the
forgiving
the
merciful
o
my
pen
verily
lamenteth
over
mine
own
self
and
my
tablet
weepeth
sore
over
what
hath
befallen
me
at
the
hands
of
one
mírzá
yaḥyá
over
whom
we
watched
for
successive
years
and
who
day
and
night
served
in
my
presence
until
he
was
made
to
err
by
one
of
my
servants
named
siyyid
muḥammad
unto
this
bear
witness
my
believing
servants
who
accompanied
me
in
my
exile
from
to
this
the
most
great
prison
and
there
befell
me
at
the
hands
of
both
of
them
that
which
made
every
man
of
understanding
to
cry
out
and
he
who
is
endued
with
insight
to
groan
aloud
and
the
tears
of
the
to
flow
we
pray
to
god
to
graciously
assist
them
that
have
been
led
astray
to
be
just
and
and
to
make
them
aware
of
that
whereof
they
have
been
heedless
he
in
truth
is
the
the
most
generous
debar
not
thy
servants
o
my
lord
from
the
door
of
thy
grace
and
drive
them
not
away
from
the
court
of
thy
presence
assist
them
to
dispel
the
mists
of
idle
fancy
and
to
tear
away
the
veils
of
vain
imaginings
and
hopes
thou
art
verily
the
the
most
high
no
god
is
there
but
thee
the
almighty
the
gracious
i
swear
by
the
daystar
of
god
s
testimony
that
hath
shone
from
the
horizon
of
certitude
this
wronged
one
in
the
daytime
and
in
the
occupied
himself
with
that
which
would
edify
the
souls
of
men
until
the
light
of
knowledge
prevailed
over
the
darkness
of
ignorance
o
time
and
again
have
i
declared
and
now
yet
again
i
affirm
that
for
two
score
years
we
have
through
the
grace
of
god
and
by
his
irresistible
and
potent
will
extended
such
aid
to
his
majesty
the
god
assist
the
exponents
of
justice
and
of
equity
would
regard
as
incontestable
and
absolute
none
can
deny
it
unless
he
be
a
transgressor
and
sinner
or
one
who
would
hate
us
or
doubt
our
truth
how
very
strange
that
until
now
the
ministers
of
state
and
the
representatives
of
the
people
have
alike
remained
unaware
of
such
conspicuous
and
undeniable
service
and
if
apprized
of
it
have
for
reasons
of
their
own
chosen
to
ignore
it
previous
to
these
forty
years
controversies
and
conflicts
continually
prevailed
and
agitated
the
servants
of
god
but
since
then
aided
by
the
hosts
of
wisdom
of
utterance
of
exhortations
and
understanding
they
have
all
seized
and
taken
fast
hold
of
the
firm
cord
of
patience
and
of
the
shining
hem
of
fortitude
in
such
wise
that
this
wronged
people
endured
steadfastly
whatever
befell
them
and
committed
everything
unto
god
and
this
notwithstanding
that
in
mázindarán
and
at
a
great
many
have
been
most
hideously
tormented
among
them
was
his
honor
ḥájí
náṣir
who
unquestionably
was
a
brilliant
light
that
shone
forth
above
the
horizon
of
resignation
after
he
had
suffered
martyrdom
they
plucked
out
his
eyes
and
cut
off
his
nose
and
inflicted
on
him
such
indignities
that
strangers
wept
and
lamented
and
secretly
raised
funds
to
support
his
wife
and
children
o
my
pen
is
abashed
to
recount
what
actually
took
place
in
the
land
of
sád
iṣfáhán
the
fire
of
tyranny
burned
with
such
a
hot
flame
that
every
person
groaned
aloud
by
thy
life
the
cities
of
knowledge
and
of
understanding
wept
with
such
a
weeping
that
the
souls
of
the
pious
and
of
the
were
melted
the
twin
shining
lights
ḥasan
and
ḥusayn
the
king
of
martyrs
and
the
beloved
of
martyrs
offered
up
spontaneously
their
lives
in
that
city
neither
fortune
nor
wealth
nor
glory
could
deter
them
god
knoweth
the
things
which
befell
them
and
yet
the
people
are
for
the
most
part
unaware
before
them
one
named
kázim
and
they
who
were
with
him
and
after
them
his
honor
all
quaffed
the
draught
of
martyrdom
with
the
utmost
fervor
and
longing
and
hastened
unto
the
supreme
companion
in
like
manner
at
the
time
of
sardár
azíz
that
godly
man
mírzá
muṣṭafá
and
his
fellow
martyrs
were
arrested
and
despatched
unto
the
supreme
friend
in
the
horizon
briefly
in
every
city
the
evidences
of
a
tyranny
beyond
like
or
equal
were
unmistakably
clear
and
manifest
and
yet
none
arose
in
call
thou
to
mind
his
honor
badí
who
was
the
bearer
of
the
tablet
to
his
majesty
the
and
reflect
how
he
laid
down
his
life
that
knight
who
spurred
on
his
charger
in
the
arena
of
renunciation
threw
down
the
precious
crown
of
life
for
the
sake
of
him
who
is
the
incomparable
friend
o
if
things
such
as
these
are
to
be
denied
what
shall
then
be
deemed
worthy
of
credence
set
forth
the
truth
for
the
sake
of
god
and
be
not
of
them
that
hold
their
peace
they
arrested
his
honor
alí
who
hastened
with
rapture
and
great
longing
unto
the
field
of
martyrdom
uttering
these
words
we
have
kept
both
bahá
and
the
bloodmoney
with
these
words
he
yielded
up
his
spirit
meditate
on
the
splendor
and
glory
which
the
light
of
renunciation
shining
from
the
upper
chamber
of
the
heart
of
mullá
hath
shed
he
was
so
carried
away
by
the
breezes
of
the
most
sublime
word
and
by
the
power
of
the
pen
of
glory
that
to
him
the
field
of
martyrdom
equalled
nay
outrivalled
the
haunts
of
earthly
delights
ponder
upon
the
conduct
of
and
siyyid
they
sent
for
the
mother
of
to
dissuade
her
son
from
his
purpose
but
she
spurred
him
on
until
he
suffered
a
most
glorious
martyrdom
o
this
people
have
passed
beyond
the
narrow
straits
of
names
and
pitched
their
tents
upon
the
shores
of
the
sea
of
renunciation
they
would
willingly
lay
down
a
myriad
lives
rather
than
breathe
the
word
desired
by
their
enemies
they
have
clung
to
that
which
pleaseth
god
and
are
wholly
detached
and
freed
from
the
things
which
pertain
unto
men
they
have
preferred
to
have
their
heads
cut
off
rather
than
utter
one
unseemly
word
ponder
this
in
thine
heart
methinks
they
have
quaffed
their
fill
of
the
ocean
of
renunciation
the
life
of
the
present
world
hath
failed
to
withhold
them
from
suffering
martyrdom
in
the
path
of
god
in
mázindarán
a
vast
number
of
the
servants
of
god
were
exterminated
the
governor
under
the
influence
of
calumniators
robbed
a
great
many
of
all
that
they
possessed
among
the
charges
he
laid
against
them
was
that
they
had
been
laying
up
arms
whereas
upon
investigation
it
was
found
out
that
they
had
nothing
but
an
unloaded
rifle
gracious
god
this
people
need
no
weapons
of
destruction
inasmuch
as
they
have
girded
themselves
to
reconstruct
the
world
their
hosts
are
the
hosts
of
goodly
deeds
and
their
arms
the
arms
of
upright
conduct
and
their
commander
the
fear
of
god
blessed
that
one
that
judgeth
with
fairness
by
the
righteousness
of
god
such
hath
been
the
patience
the
calm
the
resignation
and
contentment
of
this
people
that
they
have
become
the
exponents
of
justice
and
so
great
hath
been
their
forbearance
that
they
have
suffered
themselves
to
be
killed
rather
than
kill
and
this
notwithstanding
that
these
whom
the
world
hath
wronged
have
endured
tribulations
the
like
of
which
the
history
of
the
world
hath
never
recorded
nor
the
eyes
of
any
nation
witnessed
what
is
it
that
could
have
induced
them
to
reconcile
themselves
to
these
grievous
trials
and
to
refuse
to
put
forth
a
hand
to
repel
them
what
could
have
caused
such
resignation
and
serenity
the
true
cause
is
to
be
found
in
the
ban
which
the
pen
of
glory
hath
day
and
night
chosen
to
impose
and
in
our
assumption
of
the
reins
of
authority
through
the
power
and
might
of
him
who
is
the
lord
of
all
mankind
remember
the
father
of
badí
they
arrested
that
wronged
one
and
ordered
him
to
curse
and
revile
his
faith
he
however
through
the
grace
of
god
and
the
mercy
of
his
lord
chose
martyrdom
and
attained
thereunto
if
ye
would
reckon
up
the
martyrs
in
the
path
of
god
ye
could
not
count
them
consider
his
honor
siyyid
ismá
him
be
the
peace
of
god
and
his
before
daybreak
he
was
wont
to
dust
with
his
own
turban
the
doorstep
of
my
house
and
in
the
end
whilst
standing
on
the
banks
of
the
river
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
that
same
house
offered
up
by
his
own
hand
his
life
do
thou
ponder
on
the
penetrative
influence
of
the
word
of
god
every
single
one
of
these
souls
was
first
ordered
to
blaspheme
and
curse
his
faith
yet
none
was
found
to
prefer
his
own
will
to
the
will
of
god
o
in
former
times
he
that
was
chosen
to
be
slain
was
but
one
person
whereas
now
this
wronged
one
hath
produced
for
thee
that
which
causeth
every
man
to
marvel
judge
fairly
i
adjure
thee
and
arise
to
serve
thy
lord
he
verily
shall
reward
thee
with
a
reward
which
neither
the
treasures
of
the
earth
nor
all
the
possessions
of
kings
and
rulers
can
equal
in
all
thine
affairs
put
thy
reliance
in
god
and
commit
them
unto
him
he
will
render
thee
a
reward
which
the
book
hath
ordained
as
great
occupy
thyself
during
these
fleeting
days
of
thy
life
with
such
deeds
as
will
diffuse
the
fragrance
of
divine
good
pleasure
and
will
be
adorned
with
the
ornament
of
his
acceptance
the
acts
of
his
honor
balál
the
ethiopian
were
so
acceptable
in
the
sight
of
god
that
the
sín
of
his
stuttering
tongue
excelled
the
pronounced
by
all
the
world
this
is
the
day
whereon
all
peoples
should
shed
the
light
of
unity
and
concord
in
brief
the
pride
and
vanity
of
certain
of
the
peoples
of
the
world
have
made
havoc
of
true
understanding
and
laid
waste
the
home
of
justice
and
of
equity
o
that
which
hath
touched
this
wronged
one
is
beyond
compare
or
equal
we
have
borne
it
all
with
the
utmost
willingness
and
resignation
so
that
the
souls
of
men
may
be
edified
and
the
word
of
god
be
exalted
while
confined
in
the
prison
of
the
land
of
mím
mázindarán
we
were
one
day
delivered
into
the
hands
of
the
divines
thou
canst
well
imagine
what
befell
us
shouldst
thou
at
some
time
happen
to
visit
the
dungeon
of
his
majesty
the
ask
the
director
and
chief
jailer
to
show
thee
those
two
chains
one
of
which
is
known
as
and
the
other
as
salásil
i
swear
by
the
daystar
of
justice
that
for
four
months
this
wronged
one
was
tormented
and
chained
by
one
or
the
other
of
them
my
grief
exceedeth
all
the
woes
to
which
jacob
gave
vent
and
all
the
afflictions
of
job
are
but
a
part
of
my
sorrows
likewise
ponder
thou
upon
the
martyrdom
of
ḥájí
in
the
city
of
love
the
tyrants
of
the
earth
have
subjected
that
wronged
one
to
such
trials
as
have
caused
many
foreigners
to
weep
and
lament
for
as
reported
and
ascertained
no
less
than
wounds
were
inflicted
upon
his
blessed
body
yet
none
of
the
faithful
transgressed
my
commandment
nor
raised
his
hand
in
resistance
come
what
might
they
refused
to
allow
their
own
inclinations
to
supersede
that
which
the
book
hath
decreed
though
a
considerable
number
of
this
people
have
resided
and
still
reside
in
that
city
we
entreat
his
majesty
the
god
hallowed
and
glorified
be
he
assist
to
ponder
upon
these
things
and
to
judge
with
equity
and
justice
although
in
recent
years
a
number
of
the
faithful
have
in
most
of
the
cities
of
persia
suffered
themselves
to
be
killed
rather
than
kill
yet
the
hatred
smouldering
in
certain
hearts
hath
blazed
more
fiercely
than
before
for
the
victims
of
oppression
to
intercede
in
favor
of
their
enemies
is
in
the
estimation
of
rulers
a
princely
deed
some
must
have
certainly
heard
that
this
oppressed
people
have
in
that
city
pleaded
with
the
governor
on
behalf
of
their
murderers
and
asked
for
the
mitigation
of
their
sentence
take
then
good
heed
ye
who
are
men
of
insight
o
these
perspicuous
verses
have
been
sent
down
in
one
of
the
tablets
by
the
abhá
pen
hearken
o
servant
unto
the
voice
of
this
wronged
one
who
hath
endured
grievous
vexations
and
trials
in
the
path
of
god
the
lord
of
all
names
until
such
time
as
he
was
cast
into
prison
in
the
land
of
tá
ṭihrán
he
summoned
men
unto
the
most
sublime
paradise
and
yet
they
seized
him
and
paraded
him
through
cities
and
countries
how
many
the
nights
during
which
slumber
fled
from
the
eyes
of
my
loved
ones
because
of
their
love
for
me
and
how
numerous
the
days
whereon
i
had
to
face
the
assaults
of
the
peoples
against
me
at
one
time
i
found
myself
on
the
heights
of
mountains
at
another
in
the
depths
of
the
prison
of
tá
ṭihrán
in
chains
and
fetters
by
the
righteousness
of
god
i
was
at
all
times
thankful
unto
him
uttering
his
praise
engaged
in
remembering
him
directed
towards
him
satisfied
with
his
pleasure
and
lowly
and
submissive
before
him
so
passed
my
days
until
they
ended
in
this
prison
akká
which
hath
made
the
earth
to
tremble
and
the
heavens
to
sigh
happy
that
one
who
hath
cast
away
his
vain
imaginings
when
he
who
was
hid
came
with
the
standards
of
his
signs
we
verily
have
announced
unto
men
this
most
great
revelation
and
yet
the
people
are
in
a
state
of
strange
stupor
thereupon
a
voice
was
raised
from
the
direction
of
ḥijáz
calling
aloud
and
saying
great
is
thy
blessedness
o
akká
in
that
god
hath
made
thee
the
dayspring
of
his
most
sweet
voice
and
the
dawn
of
his
most
mighty
signs
happy
art
thou
in
that
the
throne
of
justice
hath
been
established
upon
thee
and
the
daystar
of
god
s
and
bounty
hath
shone
forth
above
thy
horizon
well
is
it
with
every
person
that
hath
judged
fairly
him
who
is
the
most
great
remembrance
and
woe
betide
him
that
hath
erred
and
doubted
following
upon
the
death
of
some
of
the
martyrs
the
tablet
of
the
proof
was
sent
down
from
the
heaven
of
the
revelation
of
him
who
is
the
lord
of
religions
he
is
the
almighty
the
the
the
winds
of
hatred
have
encompassed
the
ark
of
bathá
mecca
by
reason
of
that
which
the
hands
of
the
oppressors
have
wrought
o
thou
who
art
reputed
for
thy
learning
thou
hast
pronounced
sentence
against
them
for
whom
the
books
of
the
world
have
wept
and
in
whose
favor
the
scriptures
of
all
religions
have
testified
thou
who
art
gone
far
astray
art
indeed
wrapt
in
a
thick
veil
by
god
himself
thou
hast
pronounced
judgment
against
them
through
whom
the
horizon
of
faith
hath
been
illumined
unto
this
bear
witness
they
who
are
the
of
revelation
and
the
manifestations
of
the
cause
of
thy
lord
the
most
merciful
who
have
sacrificed
their
souls
and
all
that
they
possessed
in
his
straight
path
the
faith
of
god
hath
cried
everywhere
by
reason
of
thy
tyranny
and
yet
thou
disportest
thyself
and
art
of
them
that
exult
there
is
no
hatred
in
mine
heart
for
thee
nor
for
anyone
every
man
of
discernment
beholdeth
thee
and
such
as
are
like
thee
engulfed
in
evident
folly
hadst
thou
realized
that
which
thou
hast
done
thou
wouldst
have
cast
thyself
into
the
fire
or
abandoned
thine
home
and
fled
unto
the
mountains
or
wouldst
have
groaned
until
thou
hadst
returned
unto
the
place
destined
for
thee
by
him
who
is
the
lord
of
strength
and
of
might
o
thou
who
art
even
as
nothing
rend
thou
asunder
the
veils
of
idle
fancies
and
vain
imaginings
that
thou
mayest
behold
the
daystar
of
knowledge
shining
from
this
resplendent
horizon
thou
hast
torn
in
pieces
a
remnant
of
the
prophet
himself
and
imagined
that
thou
hadst
helped
the
faith
of
god
thus
hath
thy
soul
prompted
thee
and
thou
art
truly
one
of
the
heedless
thine
act
hath
consumed
the
hearts
of
the
concourse
on
high
and
those
of
such
as
have
circled
round
the
cause
of
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
the
soul
of
the
chaste
one
fátimih
melted
by
reason
of
thy
cruelty
and
the
inmates
of
paradise
wept
sore
in
that
blessed
spot
judge
thou
fairly
i
adjure
thee
by
god
what
proof
did
the
jewish
doctors
adduce
wherewith
to
condemn
him
who
was
the
spirit
of
god
jesus
christ
when
he
came
unto
them
with
truth
what
could
have
been
the
evidence
produced
by
the
pharisees
and
the
idolatrous
priests
to
justify
their
denial
of
muḥammad
the
apostle
of
god
when
he
came
unto
them
with
a
book
that
judged
between
truth
and
falsehood
with
a
justice
which
turned
into
light
the
darkness
of
the
earth
and
enraptured
the
hearts
of
such
as
had
known
him
indeed
thou
hast
produced
in
this
day
the
same
proofs
which
the
foolish
divines
advanced
in
that
age
unto
this
testifieth
he
who
is
the
king
of
the
realm
of
grace
in
this
great
prison
thou
hast
truly
walked
in
their
ways
nay
hast
surpassed
them
in
their
cruelty
and
hast
deemed
thyself
to
be
helping
the
faith
and
defending
the
law
of
god
the
the
by
him
who
is
the
truth
thine
iniquity
hath
made
gabriel
to
groan
and
hath
drawn
tears
from
the
law
of
god
through
which
the
breezes
of
justice
have
been
wafted
over
all
who
are
in
heaven
and
on
earth
hast
thou
fondly
imagined
that
the
judgment
thou
didst
pronounce
hath
profited
thee
nay
by
him
who
is
the
king
of
all
names
unto
thy
loss
testifieth
he
with
whom
is
the
knowledge
of
all
things
as
recorded
in
the
preserved
tablet
o
thou
who
hast
gone
astray
thou
hast
neither
seen
me
nor
associated
with
me
nor
been
my
companion
for
the
fraction
of
a
moment
how
is
it
then
that
thou
hast
bidden
men
to
curse
me
didst
thou
in
this
follow
the
promptings
of
thine
own
desires
or
didst
thou
obey
thy
lord
produce
thou
a
sign
if
thou
art
one
of
the
truthful
we
testify
that
thou
hast
cast
behind
thy
back
the
law
of
god
and
laid
hold
on
the
dictates
of
thy
passions
nothing
in
truth
escapeth
his
knowledge
he
verily
is
the
incomparable
the
o
heedless
one
hearken
unto
that
which
the
merciful
hath
revealed
in
the
qur
án
say
not
to
every
one
who
meeteth
you
with
a
greeting
thou
art
not
a
believer
thus
hath
he
decreed
in
whose
grasp
are
the
kingdoms
of
revelation
and
of
creation
if
thou
be
of
them
that
hearken
thou
hast
set
aside
the
commandment
of
god
and
clung
unto
the
promptings
of
thine
own
desire
woe
then
unto
thee
o
careless
one
that
doubtest
if
thou
deniest
me
by
what
proof
canst
thou
vindicate
the
truth
of
that
which
thou
dost
possess
produce
it
then
o
thou
who
hast
joined
partners
with
god
and
turned
aside
from
his
sovereignty
that
hath
encompassed
the
worlds
know
thou
that
he
is
truly
learned
who
hath
acknowledged
my
revelation
and
drunk
from
the
ocean
of
my
knowledge
and
soared
in
the
atmosphere
of
my
love
and
cast
away
all
else
besides
me
and
taken
firm
hold
on
that
which
hath
been
sent
down
from
the
kingdom
of
my
wondrous
utterance
he
verily
is
even
as
an
eye
unto
mankind
and
as
the
spirit
of
life
unto
the
body
of
all
creation
glorified
be
the
who
hath
enlightened
him
and
caused
him
to
arise
and
serve
his
great
and
mighty
cause
verily
such
a
man
is
blessed
by
the
concourse
on
high
and
by
them
who
dwell
within
the
tabernacle
of
grandeur
who
have
quaffed
my
sealed
wine
in
my
name
the
omnipotent
the
if
thou
be
of
them
that
occupy
such
a
sublime
station
produce
then
a
sign
from
god
the
creator
of
the
heavens
and
shouldst
thou
recognize
thy
powerlessness
do
thou
rein
in
thy
passions
and
return
unto
thy
lord
that
perchance
he
may
forgive
thee
thy
sins
which
have
caused
the
leaves
of
the
divine
to
be
burnt
up
and
the
rock
to
cry
out
and
the
eyes
of
men
of
understanding
to
weep
because
of
thee
the
veil
of
divinity
was
rent
asunder
and
the
ark
has
foundered
and
the
was
hamstrung
and
the
spirit
jesus
groaned
in
his
sublime
retreat
disputest
thou
with
him
who
hath
come
unto
thee
with
the
testimonies
of
god
and
his
signs
which
thou
possessest
and
which
are
in
the
possession
of
them
that
dwell
on
earth
open
thine
eyes
that
thou
mayest
behold
this
wronged
one
shining
forth
above
the
horizon
of
the
will
of
god
the
sovereign
the
truth
the
resplendent
unstop
then
the
ear
of
thine
heart
that
thou
mayest
hearken
unto
the
speech
of
the
divine
that
hath
been
raised
up
in
truth
by
god
the
almighty
the
beneficent
verily
this
tree
notwithstanding
the
things
that
befell
it
by
reason
of
thy
cruelty
and
of
the
transgressions
of
such
as
are
like

aloud
and
summoneth
all
men
unto
the
sadratu

the
soul
that
hath

aside

done
wickedly
o
thou
who
hast
turned
away
from
god
wert
thou
to
look
with
the
eye
of
fairness
upon
the
divine
thou
wouldst
perceive
the
marks
of
thy
sword
on
its
boughs

its
branches

its
leaves
notwithstanding
that
god
created
thee
for
the
purpose
of
recognizing
and
of
serving
it

that
haply
thou
mayest
recognize
thine
iniquity
and
be
numbered
with
such
as
have
repented

thou
that
we
fear
thy
cruelty
know
thou
and
be
well
assured
that
from
the
first
day
whereon

the
most
sublime
pen

raised
betwixt
earth
and
heaven
we
offered
up
our
souls
and
our
bodies
and
our
sons
and
our
possessions
in
the
path
of
god
the
exalted
the
great
and
we
glory
therein
amongst
all
created
things
and
the
concourse
on
high
unto
this
testify
the
things
which
have
befallen
us
in
this
straight
path
by
god
our
hearts
were
consumed
and
our
bodies
were
crucified
and
our
blood
was
spilt
while
our
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
horizon
of
the
of

woes
the

judge
thou
fairly
and
be
not
of
them
that
rove
distraught
in
the
wilderness
of
falsehood
so
carried
away
have
they
been
by
the
living
waters
of
the
love
of
the
most
merciful
that
neither
the
arms
of

nor

deterred
them
from
setting
their

towards
the
ocean
of
the
bounty
of
their
lord
the
giver
the
generous
by
god
troubles
have
failed
to
unnerve
me
and
the
repudiation
of
the
divines
hath
been
powerless
to
weaken
me
i
have
spoken
and
still
speak
forth
before
the
face
of
men
the
door
of
grace
hath
been
unlocked
and
he
who
is
the
dayspring
of
justice
is
come
with
perspicuous
signs
and
evident
testimonies
from
god
the
lord
of
strength
and
of
might
present
thyself
before
me
that
thou
mayest
hear
the
mysteries
which
were
heard
by
the
son
of
imrán
moses
upon
the
sinai
of
wisdom
thus
commandeth
thee
he
who
is
the
of
the
revelation
of
thy
lord
the
god
of
mercy
from
his
great
prison
thereupon
hath
the
cry
and
the
lamentation
of
the
true
faith
been
raised
once
again
saying
verily
sinai
calleth
aloud
and
saith
o
people
of
the
bayán
fear
ye
the
merciful
indeed
have
i
attained
unto
him
who
conversed
upon
me
and
the
ecstasies
of
my
joy
have
seized
the
pebbles
of
the
earth
and
the
dust
and
the
bush
exclaimeth
o
people
of
the
bayán
judge
ye
fairly
that
which
hath
in
truth
been
manifested
verily
the
fire
which
god
revealed
unto
the
one
who
conversed
with
him
is
now
manifested
unto
this
beareth
witness
every
man
of
insight
and
we
have
made
mention
of
certain
martyrs
of
this
revelation
and
have
likewise
cited
some
of
the
verses
which
were
sent
down
concerning
them
from
the
kingdom
of
our
utterance
we
fain
would
hope
that
rid
of
all
attachment
to
the
world
thou
wilt
ponder
the
things
which
we
have
mentioned
it
behooveth
thee
now
to
reflect
upon
the
state
of
mírzá
hádí
and
of
sadru
ulamá
who
reside
in
the
land
of
tá
ṭihrán
no
sooner
had
the
former
heard
that
he
had
been
called
a
bábí
than
he
became
so
perturbed
that
his
poise
and
dignity
forsook
him
he
ascended
the
pulpits
and
spoke
words
which
ill
befitted
him
from
time
immemorial
the
clay
clods
of
the
world
have
wholly
by
reason
of
their
love
of
leadership
perpetrated
such
acts
as
have
caused
men
to
err
thou
must
not
however
imagine
that
all
the
faithful
are
such
as
these
two
we
have
described
unto
thee
the
constancy
the
firmness
the
steadfastness
the
certitude
the
imperturbability
and
the
dignity
of
the
martyrs
of
this
revelation
that
thou
mayest
be
my
purpose
in
citing
the
passages
from
the
tablets
to
the
kings
and
others
hath
been
that
thou
mayest
know
of
a
certainty
that
this
wronged
one
hath
not
concealed
the
cause
of
god
but
hath
proclaimed
and
delivered
in
the
most
eloquent
language
before
the
face
of
the
world
the
things
he
had
been
commissioned
to
set
forth
certain
ones
however
such
as
hádí
and
others
have
tampered
with
the
cause
of
god
and
have
in
their
concern
for
this
fleeting
life
said
and
done
that
which
caused
the
eye
of
justice
to
weep
and
the
pen
of
glory
to
groan
notwithstanding
their
ignorance
of
the
essentials
of
this
cause
whereas
this
wronged
one
hath
revealed
it
for
the
sake
of
god
o
hádí
thou
hast
gone
unto
my
brother
and
hast
seen
him
set
now
thy
face
towards
the
court
of
this
wronged
one
that
haply
the
breezes
of
revelation
and
the
breaths
of
inspiration
may
assist
thee
and
enable
thee
to
attain
thy
goal
whoever
gazeth
this
day
on
my
signs
will
distinguish
truth
from
falsehood
as
the
sun
from
shadow
and
will
be
made
cognizant
of
the
goal
god
is
aware
and
beareth
me
witness
that
whatever
hath
been
mentioned
was
for
the
sake
of
god
that
haply
thou
mayest
be
the
cause
of
the
guidance
of
men
and
mayest
deliver
the
peoples
of
the
world
from
idle
fancies
and
vain
imaginings
gracious
god
until
now
they
that
have
turned
aside
and
denied
me
have
failed
to
recognize
who
despatched
that
which
was
delivered
unto
the
primal
point
the
knowledge
of
it
is
with
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
exert
thyself
o
and
arise
to
serve
this
cause
the
sealed
wine
is
disclosed
in
this
day
before
the
faces
of
men
seize
it
in
the
name
of
thy
lord
and
quaff
thy
fill
in
remembrance
of
him
who
is
the
mighty
the
incomparable
night
and
day
hath
this
wronged
one
been
occupied
in
that
which
would
unite
the
hearts
and
edify
the
souls
of
men
the
events
that
have
happened
in
persia
during
the
early
years
have
truly
saddened
the
and
sincere
ones
each
year
witnessed
a
fresh
massacre
pillage
plunder
and
shedding
of
blood
at
one
time
there
appeared
in
zanján
that
which
caused
the
greatest
consternation
at
another
in
nayríz
and
at
yet
another
in
tabarsí
and
finally
there
occurred
the
episode
of
the
land
of
tá
ṭihrán
from
that
time
onwards
this
wronged
one
assisted
by
the
one
true
be
his
this
oppressed
people
with
the
things
which
beseemed
them
all
have
sanctified
themselves
from
the
things
which
they
and
others
possess
and
have
clung
unto
and
fixed
their
eyes
upon
that
which
pertaineth
unto
god
it
is
now
incumbent
upon
his
majesty
the
god
exalted
be
he
protect
deal
with
this
people
with
and
mercy
this
wronged
one
pledgeth
himself
before
the
divine
kaaba
that
apart
from
truthfulness
and
trustworthiness
this
people
will
show
forth
nothing
that
can
in
any
way
conflict
with
the
views
of
his
majesty
every
nation
must
have
a
high
regard
for
the
position
of
its
sovereign
must
be
submissive
unto
him
must
carry
out
his
behests
and
hold
fast
his
authority
the
sovereigns
of
the
earth
have
been
and
are
the
manifestations
of
the
power
the
grandeur
and
the
majesty
of
god
this
wronged
one
hath
at
no
time
dealt
deceitfully
with
anyone
every
one
is
well
aware
of
this
and
beareth
witness
unto
it
regard
for
the
rank
of
sovereigns
is
divinely
ordained
as
is
clearly
attested
by
the
words
of
the
prophets
of
god
and
his
chosen
ones
he
who
is
the
spirit
jesus
peace
be
upon
asked
o
spirit
of
god
is
it
lawful
to
give
tribute
to
caesar
or
not
and
he
made
reply
yea
render
to
caesar
the
things
that
are
caesar
s
and
to
god
the
things
that
are
god
s
he
forbade
it
not
these
two
sayings
are
in
the
estimation
of
men
of
insight
one
and
the
same
for
if
that
which
belonged
to
caesar
had
not
come
from
god
he
would
have
forbidden
it
and
likewise
in
the
sacred
verse
obey
god
and
obey
the
apostle
and
those
among
you
invested
with
authority
by
those
invested
with
authority
is
meant
primarily
and
more
especially
the
blessings
of
god
rest
upon
them
they
verily
are
the
manifestations
of
the
power
of
god
and
the
sources
of
his
authority
and
the
repositories
of
his
knowledge
and
the
daysprings
of
his
commandments
secondarily
these
words
refer
unto
the
kings
and
through
the
brightness
of
whose
justice
the
horizons
of
the
world
are
resplendent
and
luminous
we
fain
would
hope
that
his
majesty
the
will
shine
forth
with
a
light
of
justice
whose
radiance
will
envelop
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
it
is
incumbent
upon
every
one
to
beseech
the
one
true
god
on
his
behalf
for
that
which
is
meet
and
seemly
in
this
day
o
god
my
god
and
my
master
and
my
mainstay
and
my
desire
and
my
beloved
i
ask
thee
by
the
mysteries
which
were
hid
in
thy
knowledge
and
by
the
signs
which
have
diffused
the
fragrance
of
thy
and
by
the
billows
of
the
ocean
of
thy
bounty
and
by
the
heaven
of
thy
grace
and
generosity
and
by
the
blood
spilt
in
thy
path
and
by
the
hearts
consumed
in
their
love
for
thee
to
assist
his
majesty
the
with
thy
power
and
thy
sovereignty
that
from
him
may
be
manifested
that
which
will
everlastingly
endure
in
thy
books
and
thy
scriptures
and
thy
tablets
hold
thou
his
hand
o
my
lord
with
the
hand
of
thine
omnipotence
and
illuminate
him
with
the
light
of
thy
knowledge
and
adorn
him
with
the
adornment
of
thy
virtues
potent
art
thou
to
do
what
pleaseth
thee
and
in
thy
grasp
are
the
reins
of
all
created
things
no
god
is
there
but
thee
the
the
in
the
epistle
to
the
romans
saint
paul
hath
written
let
every
soul
be
subject
unto
the
higher
powers
for
there
is
no
power
but
of
god
the
powers
that
be
are
ordained
of
god
whosoever
therefore
resisteth
the
power
resisteth
the
ordinance
of
god
and
further
for
he
is
the
minister
of
god
a
revenger
to
execute
wrath
upon
him
that
doeth
evil
he
saith
that
the
appearance
of
the
kings
and
their
majesty
and
power
are
of
god
moreover
in
the
traditions
of
old
references
have
been
made
which
the
divines
have
seen
and
heard
we
beseech
and
glorified
be
aid
thee
o
to
lay
fast
hold
on
that
which
hath
been
sent
down
from
the
heaven
of
the
bounty
of
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
the
divines
must
needs
unite
with
his
majesty
the
and
cleave
unto
that
which
will
insure
the
protection
the
security
the
welfare
and
prosperity
of
men
a
just
king
enjoyeth
nearer
access
unto
god
than
anyone
unto
this
testifieth
he
who
speaketh
in
his
most
great
prison
god
there
is
none
other
god
but
him
the
one
the
incomparable
the
almighty
the
the
wert
thou
for
the
sake
of
god
to
ponder
though
it
be
but
for
an
hour
upon
the
things
which
have
occurred
in
former
times
and
more
recently
thou
wouldst
turn
away
from
the
things
thou
dost
possess
unto
the
things
which
belong
unto
god
and
wouldst
become
a
means
for
the
exaltation
of
his
word
hath
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
until
the
present
day
any
light
or
revelation
shone
forth
from
the
dayspring
of
the
will
of
god
which
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
have
accepted
and
whose
cause
they
have
acknowledged
where
is
it
to
be
found
and
what
is
its
name
since
the
seal
of
the
prophets
muḥammad
all
else
but
him
be
his
before
him
the
spirit
of
god
jesus
as
far
back
as
the
first
manifestation
all
have
at
the
time
of
their
appearance
suffered
grievously
some
were
held
to
be
possessed
others
were
called
impostors
and
were
treated
in
a
manner
that
the
pen
is
ashamed
to
describe
by
god
there
befell
them
what
hath
made
all
created
things
to
sigh
and
yet
the
people
are
for
the
most
part
sunk
in
manifest
ignorance
we
pray
god
to
assist
them
to
return
unto
him
and
to
repent
before
the
door
of
his
mercy
potent
is
he
over
all
things
at
this
moment
the
shrill
voice
of
the
most
sublime
pen
hath
been
raised
and
hath
addressed
me
saying
admonish
the
even
as
thou
hast
admonished
one
of
thy
branches
sons
that
haply
the
breezes
of
thine
utterance
may
attract
and
draw
him
nigh
unto
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
be
generous
in
prosperity
and
thankful
in
adversity
be
worthy
of
the
trust
of
thy
neighbor
and
look
upon
him
with
a
bright
and
friendly
face
be
a
treasure
to
the
poor
an
admonisher
to
the
rich
an
answerer
to
the
cry
of
the
needy
a
preserver
of
the
sanctity
of
thy
pledge
be
fair
in
thy
judgment
and
guarded
in
thy
speech
be
unjust
to
no
man
and
show
all
meekness
to
all
men
be
as
a
lamp
unto
them
that
walk
in
darkness
a
joy
to
the
sorrowful
a
sea
for
the
thirsty
a
haven
for
the
distressed
an
upholder
and
defender
of
the
victim
of
oppression
let
integrity
and
uprightness
distinguish
all
thine
acts
be
a
home
for
the
stranger
a
balm
to
the
suffering
a
tower
of
strength
for
the
fugitive
be
eyes
to
the
blind
and
a
guiding
light
unto
the
feet
of
the
erring
be
an
ornament
to
the
countenance
of
truth
a
crown
to
the
brow
of
fidelity
a
pillar
of
the
temple
of
righteousness
a
breath
of
life
to
the
body
of
mankind
an
ensign
of
the
hosts
of
justice
a
luminary
above
the
horizon
of
virtue
a
dew
to
the
soil
of
the
human
heart
an
ark
on
the
ocean
of
knowledge
a
sun
in
the
heaven
of
bounty
a
gem
on
the
diadem
of
wisdom
a
shining
light
in
the
firmament
of
thy
generation
a
fruit
upon
the
tree
of
humility
we
pray
god
to
protect
thee
from
the
heat
of
jealousy
and
the
cold
of
hatred
he
verily
is
nigh
ready
to
answer
thus
hath
my
tongue
spoken
unto
one
of
my
branches
sons
and
we
have
mentioned
it
unto
such
of
our
loved
ones
as
have
cast
away
their
idle
fancies
and
clung
unto
that
which
hath
been
prescribed
unto
them
in
the
day
whereon
the
daystar
of
certitude
hath
shone
forth
above
the
horizon
of
the
will
of
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
this
is
the
day
on
which
the
bird
of
utterance
hath
warbled
its
melody
upon
the
branches
in
the
name
of
its
lord
the
god
of
mercy
blessed
is
the
man
that
hath
on
the
wings
of
longing
soared
towards
god
the
lord
of
the
judgment
day
the
one
true
god
well
knoweth
and
all
the
company
of
his
trusted
ones
testify
that
this
wronged
one
hath
at
all
times
been
faced
with
dire
peril
but
for
the
tribulations
that
have
touched
me
in
the
path
of
god
life
would
have
held
no
sweetness
for
me
and
my
existence
would
have
profited
me
nothing
for
them
who
are
endued
with
discernment
and
whose
eyes
are
fixed
upon
the
sublime
vision
it
is
no
secret
that
i
have
been
most
of
the
days
of
my
life
even
as
a
slave
sitting
under
a
sword
hanging
on
a
thread
knowing
not
whether
it
would
fall
soon
or
late
upon
him
and
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
we
render
thanks
unto
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
mine
inner
tongue
reciteth
in
the
daytime
and
in
the
this
prayer
glory
to
thee
o
my
god
but
for
the
tribulations
which
are
sustained
in
thy
path
how
could
thy
true
lovers
be
recognized
and
were
it
not
for
the
trials
which
are
borne
for
love
of
thee
how
could
the
station
of
such
as
yearn
for
thee
be
revealed
thy
might
beareth
me
witness
the
companions
of
all
who
adore
thee
are
the
tears
they
shed
and
the
comforters
of
such
as
seek
thee
are
the
groans
they
utter
and
the
food
of
them
who
haste
to
meet
thee
is
the
fragments
of
their
broken
hearts
how
sweet
to
my
taste
is
the
bitterness

of
the

that
there
is
none

him
the

the
straight
path
hath

been
informed

chosen
to
close
his
eyes
to
thine
acts

hath
he
been
seized
with
fear
at
the
howling
of
a
pack
of
wolves
who
have
cast
the
path
of
god
behind
their
backs
and
followed
in
thy
way
without
any
clear
proof
or
book
we
have
heard
that
the
provinces
of
persia
have
been
adorned
with
the
adornment
of
justice
when
we
observed
closely
however
we
found
them
to
be
the
of
tyranny
and
the
daysprings
of
injustice
we
behold
justice
in
the
clutches
of
tyranny
we
beseech
god
to
set
it
free
through
the
power
of
his
might
and
his
sovereignty
he
verily
overshadoweth
all
that
is
in
the

on

to
none
is
given
the
right
to
protest
against
any
one
concerning
that
which
hath
befallen
the
cause
of
god
it
behooveth
whosoever
hath
set
his
face
towards
the
most
sublime
horizon
to
cleave
tenaciously
unto
the
cord
of
patience
and
to
put
his
reliance
in
god
the
help
in
peril
the
unconstrained
o
ye
loved
ones
of
god
drink
your
fill
from
the
wellspring
of
wisdom
and
soar
ye
in
the
atmosphere
of
wisdom
and
speak
forth
with
wisdom
and
eloquence
thus
biddeth
you
your
lord
the
almighty
the
o
heedless
one
rely
not
on
thy
glory
and
thy
power
thou
art
even
as
the
last
trace
of
sunlight
upon
the
soon
will
it
fade
away
as
decreed
by
god
the
the
most
high
thy
glory
and
the
glory
of
such
as
are
like
thee
have
been
taken
away
and
this
verily
is
what
hath
been
ordained
by
the
one
with
whom
is
the
mother
tablet
where
is
he
to
be
found
who
contended
with
god
and
whither
is
gone
he
that
gainsaid
his
signs
and
turned
aside
from
his
sovereignty
where
are
they
who
have
slain
his
chosen
ones
and
spilt
the
blood
of
his
holy
ones
reflect
that
haply
thou
mayest
perceive
the
breaths
of
thine
acts
o
foolish
doubter
because
of
you
the
apostle
muḥammad
lamented
and
the
chaste
one
fátimih
cried
out
and
the
countries
were
laid
waste
and
darkness
fell
upon
all
regions
o
concourse
of
divines
because
of
you
the
people
were
abased
and
the
banner
of
islám
was
hauled
down
and
its
mighty
throne
subverted
every
time
a
man
of
discernment
hath
sought
to
hold
fast
unto
that
which
would
exalt
islám
ye
raised
a
clamor
and
thereby
was
he
deterred
from
achieving
his
purpose
while
the
land
remained
fallen
in
clear
ruin
o
my
supreme
pen
call
thou
to
remembrance
the
ih
of
iṣfáhán
whose
cruelty
hath
caused
all
created
things
to
groan
and
the
limbs
of
the
holy
ones
to
quake
thus
biddeth
thee
the
lord
of
all
names
in
this
glorious
station
the
chaste
one
fátimih
hath
cried
out
by
reason
of
thine
iniquity
and
yet
thou
dost
imagine
thyself
to
be
of
the
family
of
the
apostle
of
god
thus
hath
thy
soul
prompted
thee
o
thou
who
hast
withdrawn
thyself
from
god
the
lord
of
all
that
hath
been
and
shall
be
judge
thou
equitably
o
for
what
crime
didst
thou
sting
the
children
of
the
apostle
of
god
king
of
martyrs
and
beloved
of
martyrs
and
pillage
their
possessions
hast
thou
denied
him
who
created
thee
by
his
command
be
and
it
was
thou
hast
dealt
with
the
children
of
the
apostle
of
god
as
neither
ád
hath
dealt
with
húd
nor
with
ṣáliḥ
nor
the
jews
with
the
spirit
of
god
jesus
the
lord
of
all
being
gainsayest
thou
the
signs
of
thy
lord
which
had
no
sooner
been
sent
down
from
the
heaven
of
his
cause
than
all
the
books
of
the
world
bowed
down
before
them
meditate
that
thou
mayest
be
made
aware
of
thine
act
o
heedless
outcast
erelong
will
the
breaths
of
chastisement
seize
thee
as
they
seized
others
before
thee
wait
o
thou
who
hast
joined
partners
with
god
the
lord
of
the
visible
and
the
invisible
this
is
the
day
which
god
hath
announced
through
the
tongue
of
his
apostle
reflect
that
thou
mayest
apprehend
what
the
hath
sent
down
in
the
qur
án
and
in
this
inscribed
tablet
this
is
the
day
whereon
he
who
is
the
dayspring
of
revelation
hath
come
with
clear
tokens
which
none
can
number
this
is
the
day
whereon
every
man
endued
with
perception
hath
discovered
the
fragrance
of
the
breeze
of
the
in
the
world
of
creation
and
every
man
of
insight
hath
hastened
unto
the
living
waters
of
the
mercy
of
his
lord
the
king
of
kings
o
heedless
one
the
tale
of
the
sacrifice
ishmael
hath
been
retold
and
he
who
was
to
be
offered
up
hath
directed
his
steps
towards
the
place
of
sacrifice
and
returned
not
by
reason
of
that
which
thy
hand
hath
wrought
o
perverse
hater
didst
thou
imagine
that
martyrdom
could
abase
this
cause
nay
by
him
whom
god
hath
made
to
be
the
repository
of
his
revelation
if
thou
be
of
them
that
comprehend
woe
betide
thee
o
thou
who
hast
joined
partners
with
god
and
woe
betide
them
that
have
taken
thee
as
their
leader
without
a
clear
token
or
a
perspicuous
book
how
numerous
the
oppressors
before
thee
who
have
arisen
to
quench
the
light
of
god
and
how
many
the
impious
who
murdered
and
pillaged
until
the
hearts
and
souls
of
men
groaned
by
reason
of
their
cruelty
the
sun
of
justice
hath
been
obscured
inasmuch
as
the
embodiment
of
tyranny
hath
been
stablished
upon
the
throne
of
hatred
and
yet
the
people
understand
not
o
foolish
one
thou
hast
slain
the
children
of
the
apostle
and
pillaged
their
possessions
say
was
it
in
thine
estimation
their
possessions
or
themselves
that
denied
god
judge
fairly
o
ignorant
one
that
hath
been
shut
out
as
by
a
veil
from
god
thou
hast
clung
to
tyranny
and
cast
away
justice
whereupon
all
created
things
have
lamented
and
still
thou
art
among
the
wayward
thou
hast
put
to
death
the
aged
and
plundered
the
young
thinkest
thou
that
thou
wilt
consume
that
which
thine
iniquity
hath
amassed
nay
by
myself
thus
informeth
thee
he
who
is
cognizant
of
all
by
god
the
things
thou
possessest
shall
profit
thee
not
nor
what
thou
hast
laid
up
through
thy
cruelty
unto
this
beareth
witness
thy
lord
the
thou
hast
arisen
to
put
out
the
light
of
this
cause
erelong
will
thine
own
fire
be
quenched
at
his
behest
he
verily
is
the
lord
of
strength
and
of
might
the
changes
and
chances
of
the

powers
of

attained
thereunto

enabled
thee
to
hear
the
melodies
of
the
nightingale
of
paradise
and
unveiled
to
thine
eyes
the
signs
which
god
by
his
behest
hath
sent
down
in
the
most
great
prison

thine
eye
might
be
cheered

through
the
power
of
his
testimony
to
serve
the
cause
of
god
thy
lord
the
god
of

if
thy
faith
be

seize
thou
my
tablet
and

it
in
the
bosom
of
trust

when
thou
enterest
into
the
place

what
proof
thou
hast
believed
in
this
revelation

forth
the

by
this
book
the
holy

all
will
lift
up
their
hands
towards
thee
and
will
seize
the

it
to
their
eyes
and

inhale
therefrom
the
fragrance
of
the
utterance

to
torment
thee
for
having
believed
in
his
signs
in
this
revelation
for
what
reason
could

then
torment
such
as

disbelieved
in
muḥammad

have
we
sent
down
our
verses

of
god
and
his
divine
might
as
he
alone
can
seize
who
is
the
mighty
the
strong
none
had
the
power
to
stir
up
mischief
or
sedition
now
however
as
they
have
failed
to
appreciate
this
and
these
bounties
they
have
been
and
will
be
afflicted
with
the
retribution
which
their
acts
must
entail
the
state
officials
considering
the
secret
progress
of
the
extended
cord
have
from
every
direction
incited
and
aided
mine
adversaries
in
the
great
city
constantinople
they
have
roused
a
considerable
number
of
people
to
oppose
this
wronged
one
things
have
come
to
such
a
pass
that
the
officials
in
that
city
have
acted
in
a
manner
which
hath
brought
shame
to
both
the
government
and
the
people
a
distinguished
siyyid
whose
integrity
acceptable
conduct
and
commercial
reputation
were
recognized
by
the
majority
of
men
and
who
was
regarded
by
all
as
a
highly
honored
merchant
once
visited
beirut
in
view
of
his
friendship
for
this
wronged
one
they
telegraphed
the
persian
dragoman
informing
him
that
this
siyyid
assisted
by
his
servant
had
stolen
a
sum
of
money
and
other
things
and
gone
to
akká
their
design
in
this
matter
was
to
dishonor
this
wronged
one
and
yet
far
be
it
from
the
people
of
this
country
to
allow
themselves
to
be
deflected
by
these
unseemly
tales
from
the
straight
path
of
uprightness
and
truth
briefly
they
have
assaulted
me
from
every
side
and
are
reinforcing
mine
adversaries
this
wronged
one
however
beseecheth
the
one
true
god
to
graciously
assist
every
one
in
that
which
beseemeth
these
days
day
and
night
i
fix
my
gaze
on
these
perspicuous
words
and
recite
o
god
my
god
i
beseech
thee
by
the
sun
of
thy
grace
and
the
sea
of
thy
knowledge
and
the
heaven
of
thy
justice
to
aid
them
that
have
denied
thee
to
confess
and
such
as
have
turned
aside
from
thee
to
return
and
those
who
have
calumniated
thee
to
be
just
and
assist
them
o
my
lord
to
return
unto
thee
and
to
repent
before
the
door
of
thy
grace
powerful
art
thou
to
do
what
thou
willest
and
in
thy
grasp
are
the
reins
of
all
that
is
in
the
heavens
and
all
that
is
on
earth
praise
be
unto
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
the
time
is
at
hand
when
whatsoever
lieth
hid
in
the
souls
and
hearts
of
men
will
be
disclosed
this
day
is
the
day
whereof
luqmán
spoke
unto
his
son
the
day
which
the
lord
of
glory
announced
and
with
which
he
acquainted
him
who
was
his
friend
muḥammad
through
these
his
be
he
o
my
son
verily
god
will
bring
everything
to
light
though
it
were
but
the
weight
of
a
grain
of
and
hidden
in
a
rock
or
in
the
heavens
or
in
the
earth
for
god
is
subtile
informed
of
all
this
day
the
deceitful
of
eye
and
all
that
men
s
breasts
conceal
are
made
known
and
laid
bare
before
the
throne
of
his
revelation
nothing
whatsoever
can
escape
his
knowledge
he
heareth
and
seeth
and
he
in
truth
is
the
the
how
very
strange
that
they
discern
not
between
the
trustworthy
and
the
treacherous
would
that
his
majesty
the
of
god
perpetuate
his
inquire
from
the
consuls
of
the
honored
persian
government
who
have
been
in
this
country
that
he
might
become
acquainted
with
the
activities
and
behavior
of
this
wronged
one
briefly
they
have
incited
a
great
many
such
as
and
others
and
are
busying
themselves
in
spreading
calumnies
it
is
clear
and
evident
that
they
will
surround
with
their
swords
of
hatred
and
their
shafts
of
enmity
the
one
whom
they
know
to
be
an
outcast
among
men
and
to
have
been
banished
from
one
country
to
another
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
such
iniquity
hath
been
perpetrated
nor
the
first
goblet
that
hath
been
dashed
to
the
ground
nor
the
first
veil
that
hath
been
rent
in
twain
in
the
path
of
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
this
wronged
one
however
remained
calm
and
silent
in
the
most
great
prison
busying
himself
with
his
own
affairs
and
completely
detached
from
all
else
but
god
iniquity
waxed
so
grievous
that
the
pens
of
the
world
are
powerless
to
record
it
in
this
connection
it
is
necessary
to
mention
the
following
occurrence
that
haply
men
may
take
fast
hold
of
the
cord
of
justice
and
truthfulness
ḥájí
muḥammad
him
be
the
glory
of
god
the
a
merchant
of
high
repute
unto
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
great
city
constantinople
not
long
ago
when
the
persian
embassy
in
constantinople
was
secretly
engaged
in
stirring
up
mischief
it
was
noticed
that
this
believing
and
sincere
soul
was
greatly
distressed
finally
one
night
he
threw
himself
into
the
sea
but
was
rescued
by
some
who
chanced
to
come
upon
him
at
that
moment
his
act
was
widely
commented
upon
and
given
varied
interpretations
by
different
people
following
this
one
night
he
repaired
to
a
mosque
and
as
reported
by
the
guardian
of
that
place
kept
vigil
the
whole
night
and
was
occupied
until
the
morning
in
offering
ardently
and
with
tearful
eyes
his
prayers
and
supplications
upon
hearing
him
suddenly
cease
his
devotions
the
guardian
went
to
him
and
found
that
he
had
already
surrendered
his
soul
an
empty
bottle
was
found
by
his
side
indicating
that
he
had
poisoned
himself
briefly
the
guardian
while
greatly
astonished
broke
the
news
to
the
people
it
was
found
out
that
he
had
left
two
testaments
in
the
first
he
recognized
and
confessed
the
unity
of
god
that
his
exalted
being
had
neither
peer
nor
equal
and
that
his
essence
was
exalted
above
all
praise
all
glorification
and
description
he
also
testified
to
the
revelation
of
the
prophets
and
the
holy
ones
and
recognized
what
had
been
written
down
in
the
books
of
god
the
lord
of
all
men
on
another
page
in
which
he
had
set
down
a
prayer
he
wrote
these
words
in
conclusion
this
servant
and
the
loved
ones
of
god
are
perplexed
on
the
one
hand
the
pen
of
the
most
high
hath
forbidden
all
men
to
engage
in
sedition
contention
or
conflict
and
on
the
other
that
same
pen
hath
sent
down
these
most
sublime
words
should
anyone
in
the
presence
of
the
manifestation
discover
an
evil
intention
on
the
part
of
any
soul
he
must
not
oppose
him
but
must
leave
him
to
considering
that
on
the
one
hand
this
binding
command
is
clear
and
firmly
established
and
that
on
the
other
calumnies
beyond
human
strength
to
bear
or
endure
have
been
uttered
this
servant
hath
chosen
to
commit
this
most
grievous
sin
i
turn
suppliantly
unto
the
ocean
of
god
s
bounty
and
the
heaven
of
divine
mercy
and
hope
that
he
will
blot
out
with
the
pen
of
his
grace
and
bounteousness
the
misdeeds
of
this
servant
though
my
transgressions
be
manifold
and
unnumbered
my
evildoings
yet
do
i
cleave
tenaciously
to
the
cord
of
his
bounty
and
cling
unto
the
hem
of
his
generosity
god
is
witness
and
they
that
are
nigh
unto
his
threshold
know
full
well
that
this
servant
could
not
bear
to
hear
the
tales
related
by
the
perfidious
i
therefore
have
committed
this
act
if
he
chastise
me
he
verily
is
to
be
praised
for
what
he
doeth
and
if
he
forgive
me
his
behest
shall
be
obeyed
ponder
now
o
the
influence
of
the
word
of
god
that
haply
thou
mayest
turn
from
the
left
hand
of
idle
fancy
unto
the
right
hand
of
certitude
this
wronged
one
hath
never
acted
hypocritically
towards
any
one
in
the
cause
of
god
and
hath
loudly
proclaimed
the
word
of
god
before
the
face
of
his
creatures
let
him
who
wisheth
turn
thereunto
and
let
him
who
wisheth
turn
aside
if
these
things
however
that
are
so
clear
so
manifest
and
indubitable
be
denied
what
else
can
be
deemed
acceptable
and
worthy
of
credence
in
the
estimation
of
men
of
insight
we
beseech
and
glorified
be
forgive
the
aforementioned
person
ḥájí
alí
and
change
his
evil
deeds
into
good
ones
he
verily
is
the
the
almighty
the
such
things
have
appeared
in
this
revelation
that
there
is
no
recourse
for
either
the
exponents
of
science
and
knowledge
or
the
manifestations
of
justice
and
equity
other
than
to
recognize
them
it
is
incumbent
upon
thee
in
this
day
to
arise
with
celestial
power
and
dissipate
with
the
aid
of
knowledge
the
doubts
of
the
peoples
of
the
world
so
that
all
men
may
be
sanctified
and
direct
their
steps
towards
the
most
great
ocean
and
cleave
fast
unto
that
which
god
hath
purposed
every
one
who
hath
turned
aside
from
me
hath
clung
to
his
own
idle
words
and
therewith
voiced
his
objections
to
him
who
is
the
truth
gracious
god
such
references
as
have
been
made
to
divinity
and
godhead
by
the
holy
ones
and
chosen
ones
of
god
have
been
made
a
cause
for
denial
and
repudiation
the
imám
ṣádiq
hath
said
servitude
is
a
substance
the
essence
of
which
is
divinity
the
commander
of
the
faithful
imám
alí
answered
an
arab
who
had
questioned
him
concerning
the
soul
as
follows
the
third
is
the
soul
which
is
divine
and
celestial
it
is
a
divine
energy
a
substance
simple
and
and
further
be
upon
therefore
it
is
the
most
sublime
essence
of
god
the
tree
of
blessedness
the
beyond
which
there
is
no
passing
the
garden
of
repose

imám

hath
said
when
our
qá

will
arise
the
earth
will
shine
with
the
light
of
her
lord
likewise
a
lengthy
tradition
is
attributed
to
abdi

upon
which
these
sublime
words
are
found
thereupon
will
he
who
is
the
and
glorified
be
from
the
clouds
with
the
angels
and
in
the
mighty
qur

what
can
such
expect
but
that
god
should
come
down
to
them
overshadowed
with
clouds
and
in
the
tradition
of
mufaddál
it
is
said
the
qá

will
lean
his
back
against
the
sanctuary
and
will
stretch
forth
his
hand
and
lo
it
shall
be
but
unhurt
and
he
shall
say
this
is
the
hand
of
god
the
right
hand
of
god
that
cometh
from
god
at
the
command
of
god
in
whichever
manner
these
traditions
are
interpreted
in
that

manner

them
also
interpret

quaff
the

through
the

obtain
that
which
no

up

the

thee
as
a
token

he
verily
is
the
strong
the
the
almighty
while
there
is
yet
time
and
the
blessed
is
still
calling
aloud
amongst
men
suffer
not
thyself
to
be
deprived
place
thy
trust
in
god
and
commit
thine
affairs
unto
him
and
enter
then
the
most
great
prison
that
thou
mayest
hear
what
no
ear
hath
ever
heard
and
gaze
on
that
which
no
eye
hath
ever
seen
after
such
an
exposition
can
there
remain
any
room
for
doubt
nay
by
god
who
standeth
over
his

in

i
say
on
this
day
the
blessed
words
but
he
is
the
apostle
of
god
and
the
seal
of
the

have
found
their
consummation
in
the
verse
the
day
when
mankind
shall
stand
before
the
lord
of
the
worlds
render
thou
thanksgiving
unto
god
for
so
great
a
bounty
o
the
breezes
of

can
never
be
confounded
with
other
breezes
now
the
beyond
which
there
is
no
passing
standeth
laden
with
countless
fruits
before
thy
face
besmirch
not
thyself
with
idle
fancies
as
have
done
the
people
aforetime
these
utterances
themselves
proclaim
the
true
nature
of
the
faith
of
god
he
it
is
who
witnesseth
unto
all
things
to
demonstrate
the
truth
of
his
revelation
he
hath
not
been
nor
is
he
dependent
upon
any
one
well
nigh
a
hundred
volumes
of
luminous
verses
and
perspicuous
words
have
already
been
sent
down
from
the
heaven
of
the
will
of
him
who
is
the
revealer
of
signs
and
are
available
unto
all
it
is
for
thee
to
direct
thyself
towards
the
ultimate
goal
and
the
supreme
end
and
the
most
sublime
pinnacle
that
thou
mayest
hear
and
behold
what
hath
been
revealed
by
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
ponder
a
while
upon
the
verses
concerning
the
divine
presence
which
have
been
sent
down
in
the
qur
án
by
him
who
is
the
lord
of
the
kingdom
of
names
perchance
thou
mayest
discover
the
straight
path
and
be
made
an
instrument
for
the
guidance
of
his
creatures
such
a
one
as
thou
must
needs
in
this
day
arise
to
serve
this
cause
the
abasement
of
this
wronged
one
as
well
as
thy
glory
shall
both
pass
away
strive
thou
that
haply
thou
mayest
achieve
a
deed
the
fragrance
of
which
shall
never
fade
from
the
earth
concerning
the
divine
presence
there
hath
been
sent
down
what
no
denier
hath
been
or
is
now
able
to
refute
or
repudiate
and
exalted
be
it
is
god
who
hath
reared
the
heavens
without
pillars
thou
canst
behold
then
mounted
his
throne
and
imposed
laws
on
the
sun
and
moon
each
traveleth
to
its
appointed
goal
he
ordereth
all
things
he
maketh
his
signs
clear
that
ye
may
have
firm
faith
in
the
presence
of
your
lord
he
also
saith
to
him
who
hopeth
to
attain
the
presence
of
god
the
set
time
of
god
will
surely
come
and
he
is
the
hearer
the
knower
and
further
be
as
for
those
who
believe
not
in
the
signs
of
god
or
that
they
shall
ever
attain
his
presence
these
of
my
mercy
shall
despair
and
these
doth
a
grievous
chastisement
await
and
likewise
he
saith
and
they
say
what
when
we
shall
have
lain
hidden
in
the
earth
shall
we
become
a
new
creation
yea
they
deny
that
they
shall
attain
the
presence
of
their
lord
and
likewise
he
saith
they
truly
doubt
the
presence
of
their
lord
he
verily
overshadoweth
all
things
and
likewise
he
saith
verily
they
who
hope
not
to
attain
our
presence
and
find
their
satisfaction
in
this
world
s
life
and
rest
on
it
and
who
of
our
signs
are
their
abode
the
fire
in
recompense
of
their
deeds
and
likewise
he
saith
but
when
our
clear
signs
are
recited
to
them
they
who
look
not
forward
to
attain
our
presence
say
bring
a
different
qur
án
from
this
or
make
some
change
in
say
it
is
not
for
me
to
change
it
as
mine
own
soul
prompteth
i
follow
only
what
is
revealed
to
me
verily
i
fear
if
i
rebel
against
my
lord
the
punishment
of
a
great
day
and
likewise
he
saith
then
gave
we
the
book
to
for
him
who
should
do
right
and
a
decision
for
all
matters
and
a
guidance
and
a
mercy
that
they
might
believe
in
the
presence
of
their
lord
and
likewise
he
saith
they
are
those
who
believe
not
in
the
signs
of
the
lord
or
that
they
shall
ever
attain
his
presence
vain
therefore
are
their
works
and
no
weight
will
we
allow
them
on
the
day
of
resurrection
this
shall
be
their
because
they
were
unbelievers
and
treated
my
signs
and
my
apostles
with
scorn
and
likewise
he
saith
hath
the
history
of
moses
reached
thee
when
he
saw
a
fire
and
said
to
his
family
tarry
ye
here
for
i
perceive
a
fire
haply
i
may
bring
you
a
brand
from
it
or
find
at
the
fire
a
and
when
he
came
to
it
he
was
called
to
o
moses
verily
i
am
thy
lord
therefore
pull
off
thy
shoes
for
thou
art
in
the
holy
vale
of
towa
and
i
have
chosen
thee
hearken
then
to
what
shall
be
revealed
verily
i
am
god
there
is
no
god
but
me
therefore
worship
and
likewise
he
saith
have
they
not
considered
within
themselves
that
god
hath
not
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
all
that
is
between
them
but
for
a
serious
end
and
for
a
fixed
term
but
truly
most
men
believe
not
that
they
shall
attain
the
presence
of
their
lord
and
likewise
he
saith
what
have
they
no
thought
that
they
shall
be
raised
again
for
the
great
day
the
day
when
mankind
shall
stand
before
the
lord
of
the
worlds
and
likewise
he
saith
we
heretofore
gave
the
book
to
moses
have
thou
no
doubt
as
to
his
attaining
our
presence
and
he
saith
aye
but
when
the
earth
shall
be
crushed
with
crushing
crushing
and
thy
lord
shall
come
and
the
angels
rank
on
rank
and
likewise
he
saith
fain
would
they
put
out
the
light
of
god
with
their
mouths
but
though
the
infidels
hate
it
god
will
perfect
his
light
and
likewise
he
saith
and
when
moses
had
fulfilled
the
term
and
was
journeying
with
his
family
he
perceived
a
fire
on
the
mountain
side
he
said
to
his
family
wait
ye
for
i
perceive
a
fire
haply
i
may
bring
you
tidings
from
it
or
a
brand
from
the
fire
to
warm
and
when
he
came
up
to
it
a
voice
cried
to
him
out
of
the
bush
from
the
right
side
of
the
vale
in
the
sacred
spot
o
moses
i
truly
am
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
in
all
the
divine
books
the
promise
of
the
divine
presence
hath
been
explicitly
recorded
by
this
presence
is
meant
the
presence
of
him
who
is
the
dayspring
of
the
signs
and
the
of
the
clear
tokens
and
the
manifestation
of
the
excellent
names
and
the
source
of
the
attributes
of
the
true
god
exalted
be
his
glory
god
in
his
essence
and
in
his
own
self
hath
ever
been
unseen
inaccessible
and
unknowable
by
presence
therefore
is
meant
the
presence
of
the
one
who
is
his
vicegerent
amongst
men
he
moreover
hath
never
had
nor
hath
he
any
peer
or
likeness
for
were
he
to
have
any
peer
or
likeness
how
could
it
then
be
demonstrated
that
his
being
is
exalted
above
and
his
essence
sanctified
from
all
comparison
and
likeness
briefly
there
hath
been
revealed
in
the
book
of
certitude
concerning
the
presence
and
revelation
of
god
that
which
will
suffice
the
we
beseech
be
aid
every
one
to
become
the
essence
of
truthfulness
and
to
draw
nigh
unto
him
he
verily
is
the
lord
of
strength
and
power
no
god
is
there
but
him
the
the
lord
of
utterance
the
almighty
the
o
thou
who
art
reputed
for
thy
learning
bid
men
to
do
that
which
is
praiseworthy
and
be
not
of
such
as
tarry
observe
thou
with
a
keen
eye
the
sun
of
truth
shineth
resplendently
at
the
bidding
of
the
lord
of
the
kingdom
of
utterance
and
the
king
of
the
heaven
of
knowledge
above
the
horizon
of
the
of
akká
repudiation
hath
not
veiled
it
and
ten
thousand
hosts
arrayed
against
it
were
powerless
to
withhold
it
from
shining
thou
canst
excuse
thyself
no
longer
either
thou
must
recognize
it
and
deny
all
the
prophets
reflect
o
upon
the
ih
sect
how
many
the
edifices
which
they
reared
with
the
hands
of
idle
fancies
and
vain
imaginings
and
how
numerous
the
cities
which
they
built
at
length
those
vain
imaginings
were
converted
into
bullets
and
aimed
at
him
who
is
the
prince
of
the
world
not
one
single
soul
among
the
leaders
of
that
sect
acknowledged
him
in
the
day
of
his
revelation
whenever
his
blessed
name
was
mentioned
all
would
say
may
god
hasten
the
joy
his
coming
will
bring
on
the
day
of
the
revelation
of
that
sun
of
truth
however
all
as
hath
been
observed
have
exclaimed
saying
may
god
hasten
his
chastisement
he
who
was
the
essence
of
being
and
lord
of
the
seen
and
unseen
they
suspended
and
committed
what
made
the
tablet
to
weep
and
the
pen
to
groan
and
the
cries
of
the
sincere
to
break
forth
and
the
tears
of
the
favored
ones
to
flow
meditate
o
and
be
fair
in
what
thou
sayest
the
followers
of
í
aḥmad
have
by
the
aid
of
god
apprehended
that
which
was
veiled
from
the
comprehension
of
others
and
of
which
they
remained
deprived
briefly
in
every
age
and
century
differences
have
arisen
in
the
days
of
the
manifestation
of
the
daysprings
of
revelation
and
the
of
inspiration
and
the
repositories
of
divine
knowledge
differences
which
have
been
caused
and
provoked
by
lying
and
impious
souls
to
expatiate
on
this
is
not
permissible
thou
art
thyself
better
acquainted
and
more
familiar
with
the
idle
fancies
of
the
superstitious
and
the
vain
imaginings
of
the
doubters
in
this
day
this
wronged
one
requesteth
thee
and
the
other
divines
who
have
drunk
of
the
cup
of
the
knowledge
of
god
and
are
illumined
by
the
shining
words
of
the
daystar
of
justice
to
appoint
some
person
without
informing
any
one
and
despatch
him
to
these
regions
and
enable
him
to
remain
a
while
in
the
island
of
cyprus
and
associate
with
mírzá
yaḥyá
perchance
he
may
become
aware
of
the
fundamentals
of
this
faith
and
of
the
source
of
the
divine
laws
and
commandments
wert
thou
to
ponder
a
while
thou
wouldst
bear
witness
unto
the
wisdom
and
the
power
and
the
sovereignty
of
god
exalted
be
his
glory
the
few
who
were
unaware
of
this
cause
and
had
not
met
us
have
spoken
in
such
a
manner
that
all
things
and
those
souls
who
are
well
assured
pleased
and
pleasing
unto
god
have
testified
unto
the
imposture
of
these
heedless
ones
wert
thou
now
to
exert
thyself
the
truth
of
this
cause
would
be
made
apparent
unto
mankind
and
the
people
would
be
delivered
from
this
grievous
and
oppressive
darkness
who
else
but
bahá
can
speak
forth
before
the
face
of
men
and
who
else
but
he
can
have
the
power
to
pronounce
that
which
he
was
bidden
by
god
the
lord
of
hosts
this
heedless
one
hath
now
clung
to
the
practice
of
traditional
lamentation
for
the
imám
ḥusayn
swear
by
in
evident
error
for
it
is
the
belief
of
this
people
that
during
the
revelation
of
the
qá
im
the
the
peace
of
god
be
upon
arisen
from
their
sepulchres
this
verily
is
the
truth
and
no
doubt
is
there
about
it
we
beseech
god
to
bestow
upon
the
superstitious
a
portion
of
the
living
waters
of
certitude
which
are
streaming
from
the
wellspring
of
the
most
sublime
pen
that
all
may
attain
unto
that
which
becometh
these
days
o
while
hemmed
in
by
tribulations
this
wronged
one
is
occupied
in
setting
down
these
words
on
every
side
the
flame
of
oppression
and
tyranny
can
be
discerned
on
the
one
hand
tidings
have
reached
us
that
our
loved
ones
have
been
arrested
in
the
land
of
tá
ṭihrán
and
this
notwithstanding
that
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
land
and
the
sea
all
testify
that
this
people
are
adorned
with
the
adornment
of
fidelity
and
have
clung
and
will
cling
to
naught
except
that
which
can
ensure
the
exaltation
of
the
government
and
the
maintenance
of
order
within
the
nation
and
the
tranquillity
of
the
people
o
we
have
time
and
again
stated
that
for
a
number
of
years
we
have
extended
our
aid
unto
his
majesty
the
for
years
no
untoward
incident
hath
occurred
in
persia
the
reins
of
the
stirrers
of
sedition
among
various
sects
were
held
firmly
in
the
grasp
of
power
none
hath
transgressed
his
limits
by
god
this
people
have
never
been
nor
are
they
now
inclined
to
mischief
their
hearts
are
illumined
with
the
light
of
the
fear
of
god
and
adorned
with
the
adornment
of
his
love
their
concern
hath
ever
been
and
now
is
for
the
betterment
of
the
world
their
purpose
is
to
obliterate
differences
and
quench
the
flame
of
hatred
and
enmity
so
that
the
whole
earth
may
come
to
be
viewed
as
one
country
on
the
other
hand
the
officials
of
the
persian
embassy
in
the
great
city
constantinople
are
energetically
and
assiduously
seeking
to
exterminate
these
wronged
ones
they
desire
one
thing
and
god
desireth
another
consider
now
what
hath
befallen
the
trusted
ones
of
god
in
every
land
at
one
time
they
have
been
accused
of
theft
and
larceny
at
another
they
have
been
calumniated
in
a
manner
without
parallel
in
this
world
answer
thou
fairly
what
could
be
the
results
and
consequences
in
foreign
countries
of
the
accusation
of
theft
brought
by
the
persian
embassy
against
its
own
subjects
if
this
wronged
one
was
ashamed
it
was
not
because
of
the
humiliation
it
brought
this
servant
but
rather
because
of
the
shame
of
its
becoming
known
to
the
ambassadors
of
foreign
countries
how
incompetent
and
lacking
in
understanding
are
several
eminent
officials
of
the
persian
embassy
flingest
thou
thy
calumnies
into
the
face
of
them
whom
the
one
true
god
hath
made
the
trustees
of
the
treasures
of
his
seventh
sphere
briefly
instead
of
seeking
as
they
should
through
him
who
occupieth
this
sublime
station
to
attain
unto
the
most
exalted
ranks
and
to
obtain
his
advice
they
have
exerted
themselves
and
are
striving
their
utmost
to
put
out
his
light
however
according
to
what
hath
been
reported
his
excellency
the

assist
at
that
time
absent
from
constantinople
such
things
have
happened
because
it
was
believed
that
his
majesty
the
of
the
assist
angry
with
them
that
have
attained
and
revolve
round
the
sanctuary
of
wisdom
god
well
knoweth
and
testifieth
that
this
wronged
one
hath
at
all
times
been
cleaving
fast
unto
whatever
would
be
conducive
to
the
glory
of
both
the
government
and
the
people
god
verily
is
sufficient
witness
describing
the
people
of
bahá
the
most
sublime
pen
hath
sent
down
these
words
these
verily
are
men
who
if
they
come
to
cities
of
pure
gold
will
consider
them
not
and
if
they
meet
the
fairest
and
most
comely
of
women
will
turn
aside
thus
hath
it
been
sent
down
by
the
most
sublime
pen
for
the
people
of
bahá
on
the
part
of
him
who
is
the
counsellor
the
omniscient
in
the
concluding
passages
of
the
tablet
to
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
paris
napoleon
iii
these
exalted
words
have
been
revealed
exultest
thou
over
the
treasures
thou
dost
possess
knowing
they
shall
perish
rejoicest
thou
in
that
thou
rulest
a
span
of
earth
when
the
whole
world
in
the
estimation
of
the
people
of
bahá
is
worth
as
much
as
the
black
in
the
eye
of
a
dead
ant
abandon
it
unto
such
as
have
set
their
affections
upon
it
and
turn
thou
unto
him
who
is
the
desire
of
the
world
god
be
his
cognizant
of
the
things
which
befell
this
wronged
one
every
day
bringeth
a
fresh
report
of
stories
current
against
us
at
the
embassy
in
constantinople
gracious
god
the
sole
aim
of
their
machinations
is
to
bring
about
the
extermination
of
this
servant
they
are
however
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
abasement
in
the
path
of
god
is
my
true
glory
in
the
newspapers
the
following
hath
been
recorded
touching
the
fraudulent
dealings
of
some
of
the
exiles
of
akká
and
the
excesses
committed
by
them
against
several
people
etc
unto
them
who
are
the
exponents
of
justice
and
the
daysprings
of
equity
the
intention
of
the
writer
is
evident
and
his
purpose
clear
briefly
he
arose
and
inflicted
upon
me
divers
tribulations
and
treated
me
with
injustice
and
cruelty
by
god
this
wronged
one
would
not
barter
this
place
of
exile
for
the
most
sublime
habitation
in
the
estimation
of
men
of
insight
whatsoever
befalleth
in
the
path
of
god
is
manifest
glory
and
a
supreme
attainment
already
we
have
said
glory
to
thee
o
my
god
but
for
the
tribulations
which
are
sustained
in
thy
path
how
could
thy
true
lovers
be
recognized
and
were
it
not
for
the
trials
which
are
borne
for
love
of
thee
how
could
the
station
of
such
as
yearn
for
thee
be
revealed
such
abasement
hath
been
inflicted
that
each
day
they
spread
fresh
calumnies
this
wronged
one
however
cleaveth
to
seemly
patience
would
that
his
majesty
the
of
persia
would
ask
for
a
report
of
the
things
which
befell
us
in
constantinople
that
he
might
become
fully
acquainted
with
the
true
facts
o
i
adjure
thee
by
thy
lord
the
god
of
mercy
to
look
into
this
matter
with
the
eye
of
fairness
is
there
to
be
found
a
just
man
who
will
judge
in
this
day
according
to
that
which
god
hath
sent
down
in
his
book
where
is
the
person
who
will
equitably
consider
what
hath
been
perpetrated
against
us
without
any
clear
token
or
proof
o
ponder
the
behavior
of
men
the
inmates
of
the
cities
of
knowledge
and
wisdom
are
sore
perplexed
asking
themselves
why
it
is
that
the
ih
sect
which
regarded
itself
as
the
most
learned
the
most
righteous
and
the
most
pious
of
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
hath
turned
aside
in
the
day
of
his
revelation
and
hath
shown
a
cruelty
such
as
hath
never
been
experienced
it
is
incumbent
upon
thee
to
reflect
a
while
from
the
inception
of
this
sect
until
the
present
day
how
great
hath
been
the
number
of
the
divines
that
have
appeared
none
of
whom
became
cognizant
of
the
nature
of
this
revelation
what
could
have
been
the
cause
of
this
waywardness
were
we
to
mention
it
their
limbs
would
cleave
asunder
it
is
necessary
for
them
to
meditate
to
meditate
for
a
thousand
thousand
years
that
haply
they
may
attain
unto
a
sprinkling
from
the
ocean
of
knowledge
and
discover
the
things
whereof
they
are
oblivious
in
this
day
i
was
walking
in
the
land
of
tá
ṭihrán
dayspring
of
the
signs
of
thy
lo
i
heard
the
lamentation
of
the
pulpits
and
the
voice
of
their
supplication
unto
god
blessed
and
glorified
be
he
they
cried
out
and
said
o
god
of
the
world
and
lord
of
the
nations
thou
beholdest
our
state
and
the
things
which
have
befallen
us
by
reason
of
the
cruelty
of
thy
servants
thou
hast
created
us
and
revealed
us
for
thy
glorification
and
praise
thou
dost
now
hear
what
the
wayward
proclaim
upon
us
in
thy
days
by
thy
might
our
souls
are
melted
and
our
limbs
are
trembling
alas
alas
would
that
we
had
never
been
created
and
revealed
by
thee
the
hearts
of
them
that
enjoy
near
access
to
god
are
consumed
by
these
words
and
from
them
the
cries
of
such
as
are
devoted
to
him
are
raised
time
and
again
have
we
for
the
sake
of
god
admonished
the
distinguished
divines
and
summoned
them
unto
the
most
sublime
horizon
that
perchance
they
might
in
the
days
of
his
revelation
obtain
their
portion
of
the
ocean
of
the
utterance
of
him
who
is
the
desire
of
the
world
and
remain
not
utterly
deprived
thereof
in
most
of
our
tablets
this
most
weighty
exhortation
hath
been
sent
down
from
the
heaven
of
his
mercy
we
said
o
concourse
of
rulers
and
divines
incline
your
ears
unto
the
voice
calling
from
the
horizon
of
akká
verily
it
aideth
you
to
proceed
aright
and
draweth
you
nigh
unto
him
and
directeth
your
steps
towards
the
station
which
god
hath
made
the
dayspring
of
his
revelation
and
the
of
his
splendors
o
peoples
of
the
world
he
who
is
the
most
great
name
is
come
on
the
part
of
the
ancient
king
and
hath
announced
unto
men
this
revelation
which
lay
hid
in
his
knowledge
and
was
preserved
in
the
treasury
of
his
protection
and
was
written
down
by
the
most
sublime
pen
in
the
books
of
god
the
lord
of
lords
o
people
of
have
ye
forgotten
my
and
my
mercy
that
have
surpassed
all
created
things
and
which
proceeded
from
god
who
layeth
low
the
necks
of
men
in
the
most
holy
book
the
following
hath
been
revealed
say
o
leaders
of
religion
weigh
not
the
book
of
god
with
such
standards
and
sciences
as
are
current
amongst
you
for
the
book
itself
is
the
unerring
balance
established
amongst
men
in
this
most
perfect
balance
whatsoever
the
peoples
and
kindreds
possess
must
be
weighed
while
the
measure
of
its
weight
should
be
tested
according
to
its
own
standard
did
ye
but
know
it
the
eye
of
my
weepeth
sore
over
you
inasmuch
as
ye
have
failed
to
recognize
the
one
upon
whom
ye
have
been
calling
in
the
daytime
and
in
the
night
season
at
even
and
at
morn
advance
o
people
with
faces
and
radiant
hearts
unto
the
blest
and
crimson
spot
wherein
the
tree
beyond
which
there
is
no
passing
is
calling
verily
there
is
none
other
god
beside
me
the
omnipotent
protector
the
o
ye
leaders
of
religion
in
persia
who
is
the
man
amongst
you
that
can
rival
me
in
vision
or
insight
where
is
he
to
be
found
that
dareth
to
claim
to
be
my
equal
in
utterance
or
wisdom
no
by
my
lord
the
all
on
the
earth
shall
pass
away
and
this
is
the
face
of
your
lord
the
almighty
the
we
have
decreed
o
people
that
the
highest
and
last
end
of
all
learning
be
the
recognition
of
him
who
is
the
object
of
all
knowledge
and
yet
behold
how
ye
have
allowed
your
learning
to
shut
you
out
as
by
a
veil
from
him
who
is
the
dayspring
of
this
light
through
whom
every
hidden
thing
hath
been
revealed
say
this
verily
is
the
heaven
in
which
the
mother
book
is
treasured
could
ye
but
comprehend
it
he
it
is
who
hath
caused
the
rock
to
shout
and
the
burning
bush
to
lift
up
its
voice
upon
the
mount
rising
above
the
holy
land
and
proclaim
the
kingdom
is
god
s
the
sovereign
lord
of
all
the
the
loving
we
have
not
entered
any
school
nor
read
any
of
your
dissertations
incline
your
ears
to
the
words
of
this
unlettered
one
wherewith
he
summoneth
you
unto
god
the
better
is
this
for
you
than
all
the
treasures
of
the
earth
could
ye
but
comprehend
it
whoso
interpreteth
what
hath
been
sent
down
from
the
heaven
of
revelation
and
altereth
its
evident
meaning
he
verily
is
of
them
that
have
perverted
the
sublime
word
of
god
and
is
of
the
lost
ones
in
the
lucid
book
thereupon
we
heard
the
groaning
of
the
true
faith
and
said
unto
it
wherefore
o
true
faith
do
i
hear
thee
cry
out
in
the
night
season
and
groan
in
the
daytime
and
utter
thy
lamentations
at
daybreak
she
made
reply
o
prince
of
the
world
that
standest
revealed
in
the
most
great
name
the
heedless
ones
have
hamstrung
thy
white
and
caused
thy
crimson
ark
to
founder
and
wished
to
put
out
thy
light
and
to
veil
the
face
of
thy
cause
wherefore
hath
the
voice
of
my
lamentation
been
lifted
up
as
well
as
the
voice
of
the
lamentation
of
all
created
things
and
yet
the
people
are
for
the
most
part
unaware
the
true
faith
hath
laid
fast
hold
in
this
day
on
the
hem
of
our
bounty
and
circleth
about
our
person
o
enter
thou
my
presence
that
thou
mayest
behold
what
the
eye
of
the
universe
hath
never
beheld
and
hear
that
which
the
ear
of
the
whole
creation
hath
never
heard
that
haply
thou
mayest
free
thyself
from
the
mire
of
vague
fancies
and
set
thy
face
towards
the
most
sublime
station
wherein
this
wronged
one
calleth
aloud
the
kingdom
is
god
s
the
almighty
the
we
fain
would
hope
that
through
thine
exertions
the
wings
of
men
may
be
sanctified
from
the
mire
of
self
and
desire
and
be
made
worthy
to
soar
in
the
atmosphere
of
god
s
love
wings
that
are
besmirched
with
mire
can
never
soar
unto
this
testify
they
who
are
the
exponents
of
justice
and
equity
and
yet
the
people
are
in
evident
doubt
o
protests
have
been
voiced
against
us
from
every
such
as
our
pen
craveth
pardon
for
setting
down
nevertheless
by
reason
of
our
great
mercy
we
have
replied
unto
them
in
accordance
with
the
understanding
of
men
that
haply
they
may
be
delivered
from
the
fire
of
negation
and
denial
and
become
illumined
with
the
light
of
affirmation
and
acceptance
equity
is
rarely
to
be
found
and
justice
hath
ceased
to
exist
among
others
these
perspicuous
verses
have
in
answer
to
certain
individuals
been
sent
down
from
the
kingdom
of
divine
knowledge
o
thou
who
hast
set
thy
face
towards
the
splendors
of
my
countenance
vague
fancies
have
encompassed
the
dwellers
of
the
earth
and
debarred
them
from
turning
towards
the
horizon
of
certitude
and
its
brightness
and
its
manifestations
and
its
lights
vain
imaginings
have
withheld
them
from
him
who
is

they
speak
as
prompted
by
their
own
caprices
and
understand
not
among
them

down

the
hour

revealer
of
clear
tokens
verily
the
inevitable
is
come
and
he
the
true
one
hath
appeared
with
proof
and
testimony
the
plain
is
disclosed
and
mankind
is
sore
vexed
and
fearful
earthquakes
have
broken
loose
and
the
tribes

lamented
for
fear

when
we
drew
forth
the
hand
of
power
from
the
bosom
of
majesty
and

verily
the
crier
hath
cried
out
when
the
promised
time
came
and
they
that
have
recognized
the
splendors
of

swooned
away
in

wilderness
of
hesitation

hath
been
illumined
at
the
coming
of

thou
who
hast
fixed
thy
gaze
upon
me
for
this
tablet
which
hath
been
sent
down
for

which
causeth
the
souls
of
men
to

it
to

it
by
my

of
thy
lord

is
it
with
him
that
reciteth
it
at
eventide
and
at
dawn
we
verily
hear
thy
praise
of
this
cause
through
which
the
mountain
of
knowledge
was
crushed
and

feet
have
slipped
my
glory

upon
thee
and
upon
whomsoever
hath
turned
unto
the
almighty
the
the
tablet
is
ended
but
the
theme
is
unexhausted
be
patient
for
thy
lord
is
patient
these
are
verses
we
sent
down
previously
soon
after
our
arrival
in
the
of
akká
and
we
have
sent
them
unto
thee
that
thou
mayest
be
acquainted
with
what
their
lying
tongues
have
spoken
when
our
cause
came
unto
them
with
might
and
sovereignty
the
foundations
of
idle
fancies
have
trembled
and
the
heaven
of
vain
imaginings
hath
been
cleft
asunder
and
yet
the
people
are
in
doubt
and
in
contention
with
him
they
have
denied
the
testimony
of
god
and
his
proof
after
he
came
from
the
heaven
of
power
with
the
kingdom
of
his
signs
they
have
cast
away
what
had
been
prescribed
and
perpetrated
what
had
been
forbidden
them
in
the
book
they
have
abandoned
their
god
and
clung
unto
their
desires
they
truly
have
strayed
and
are
in
error
they
read
the
verses
and
deny
them
they
behold
the
clear
tokens
and
turn
aside
they
truly
are
lost
in
strange
doubt
we
have
admonished
our
loved
ones
to
fear
god
a
fear
which
is
the
of
all
goodly
deeds
and
virtues
it
is
the
commander
of
the
hosts
of
justice
in
the
city
of
bahá
happy
the
man
that
hath
entered
the
shadow
of
its
luminous
standard
and
laid
fast
hold
thereon
he
verily
is
of
the
companions
of
the
crimson
ark
which
hath
been
mentioned
in
the
say
o
people
of
god
adorn
your
temples
with
the
adornment
of
trustworthiness
and
piety
help
then
your
lord
with
the
hosts
of
goodly
deeds
and
a
praiseworthy
character
we
have
forbidden
you
dissension
and
conflict
in
my
books
and
my
scriptures
and
my
scrolls
and
my
tablets
and
have
wished
thereby
naught
else
save
your
exaltation
and
advancement
unto
this
testify
the
heavens
and
the
stars
thereof
and
the
sun
and
the
radiance
thereof
and
the
trees
and
the
leaves
thereof
and
the
seas
and
the
waves
thereof
and
the
earth
and
the
treasures
thereof
we
pray
god
to
assist
his
loved
ones
and
aid
them
in
that
which
beseemeth
them
in
this
blest
this
mighty
and
wondrous
station
further
in
another
tablet
we
have
said
o
thou
who
hast
fixed
thy
gaze
upon
my
countenance
admonish
men
to
fear
god
by
god
this
fear
is
the
chief
commander
of
the
army
of
thy
lord
its
hosts
are
a
praiseworthy
character
and
goodly
deeds
through
it
have
the
cities
of
men
s
hearts
been
opened
throughout
the
ages
and
centuries
and
the
standards
of
ascendancy
and
triumph
raised
above
all
other
standards
we
will
now
mention
unto
thee
trustworthiness
and
the
station
thereof
in
the
estimation
of
god
thy
lord
the
lord
of
the
mighty
throne
one
day
of
days
we
repaired
unto
our
green
island
upon
our
arrival
we
beheld
its
streams
flowing
and
its
trees
luxuriant
and
the
sunlight
playing
in
their
midst
turning
our
face
to
the
right
we
beheld
what
the
pen
is
powerless
to
describe
nor
can
it
set
forth
that
which
the
eye
of
the
lord
of
mankind
witnessed
in
that
most
sanctified
that
most
sublime
that
blest
and
most
exalted
spot
turning
then
to
the
left
we
gazed
on
one
of
the
beauties
of
the
most
sublime
paradise
standing
on
a
pillar
of
light
and
calling
aloud
saying
o
inmates
of
earth
and
heaven
behold
ye
my
beauty
and
my
radiance
and
my
revelation
and
my
effulgence
by
god
the
true
one
i
am
trustworthiness
and
the
revelation
thereof
and
the
beauty
thereof
i
will
recompense
whosoever
will
cleave
unto
me
and
recognize
my
rank
and
station
and
hold
fast
unto
my
hem
i
am
the
most
great
ornament
of
the
people
of
bahá
and
the
vesture
of
glory
unto
all
who
are
in
the
kingdom
of
creation
i
am
the
supreme
instrument
for
the
prosperity
of
the
world
and
the
horizon
of
assurance
unto
all
thus
have
we
sent
down
for
thee
that
which
will
draw
men
nigh
unto
the
lord
of
creation
this
wronged
one
hath
at
all
times
summoned
the
peoples
of
the
world
unto
that
which
will
exalt
them
and
draw
them
nigh
unto
god
from
the
most
sublime
horizon
there
hath
shone
forth
that
which
leaveth
no
room
unto
any
one
for
vacillation
repudiation
or
denial
the
wayward
however
have
failed
to
profit
therefrom
nay
it
shall
only
increase
their
loss
o
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
divines
to
unite
with
his
majesty
the
god
assist
to
cleave
day
and
night
unto
that
which
will
exalt
the
station
of
both
the
government
and
the
nation
this
people
are
assiduously
occupied
in
enlightening
the
souls
of
men
and
in
rehabilitating
their
condition
unto
this
testifieth
that
which
hath
been
sent
down
by
the
most
sublime
pen
in
this
lucid
tablet
how
often
have
things
been
simple
and
easy
of
accomplishment
and
yet
most
men
have
been
heedless
and
busied
themselves
with
that
which
wasteth
their
time
one
day
while
in
constantinople
kamál
visited
this
wronged
one
our
conversation
turned
upon
topics
profitable
unto
man
he
said
that
he
had
learned
several
languages
in
reply
we
observed
you
have
wasted
your
life
it
beseemeth
you
and
the
other
officials
of
the
government
to
convene
a
gathering
and
choose
one
of
the
divers
languages
and
likewise
one
of
the
existing
scripts
or
else
to
create
a
new
language
and
a
new
script
to
be
taught
children
in
schools
throughout
the
world
they
would
in
this
way
be
acquiring
only
two
languages
one
their
own
native
tongue
the
other
the
language
in
which
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
would
converse
were
men
to
take
fast
hold
on
that
which
hath
been
mentioned
the
whole
earth
would
come
to
be
regarded
as
one
country
and
the
people
would
be
relieved
and
freed
from
the
necessity
of
acquiring
and
teaching
different
languages
when
in
our
presence
he
acquiesced
and
even
evinced
great
joy
and
complete
satisfaction
we
then
told
him
to
lay
this
matter
before
the
officials
and
ministers
of
the
government
in
order
that
it
might
be
put
into
effect
throughout
the
different
countries
however
although
he
often
returned
to
see
us
after
this
he
never
again
referred
to
this
subject
although
that
which
had
been
suggested
is
conducive
to
the
concord
and
the
unity
of
the
peoples
of
the
world
we
fain
would
hope
that
the
persian
government
will
adopt
it
and
carry
it
out
at
present
a
new
language
and
a
new
script
have
been
devised
if
thou
desirest
we
will
communicate
them
to
thee
our
purpose
is
that
all
men
may
cleave
unto
that
which
will
reduce
unnecessary
labor
and
exertion
so
that
their
days
may
be
befittingly
spent
and
ended
god
verily
is
the
helper
the
knower
the
ordainer
the
omniscient
god
willing
persia
may
be
adorned
with
and
attain
unto
that
whereof
she
hath
thus
far
been
deprived
say
o
exert
thyself
so
that
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
may
be
illumined
with
the
effulgent
splendors
of
the
sun
of
thy
justice
the
eyes
of
this
wronged
one
are
turned
towards
naught
save
trustworthiness
truthfulness
purity
and
all
that
profiteth
men
regard
him
not
as
a
traitor
glorified
art
thou
o
my
god
and
my
master
and
my
mainstay

thou
his

verily
the
the

of
grace
abounding

clung
unto
the

be
flung
wide
before
thy

thou
wilt
behold
what
eyes
have
never
beheld
and
hear
what
ears
have
never
heard
this
wronged
one
exhorteth
thee
as
he
hath
exhorted
thee
before
and
hath
never
had
any
wish
for
thee
save
that
thou
shouldst
enter
the
ocean
of
the
unity
of
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds

is
the
day

saith
that
none
is
aware
of
the
time
of
the
revelation
that
none
knoweth
it
except

cognizant
of

announcement
the
greatness
of
which
hath
been
mentioned
in
most
of

of
more
recent
times

is
the
announcement
that

caused
the
limbs
of
mankind
to
quake
except
such
as
god
the
protector
the
helper
the
succorer
hath
willed
to
exempt
men

indeed
with
their
own
eyes
witnessed
how
all
men
and
all
things
have
been
thrown
into
confusion
and
been
sore
perplexed

hath
chosen
to
exempt

upon
the
resplendent
signs
and
the
sublime
words
and
all
that
hath
been
revealed
in
these
days

thou
mayest
fathom
the
mysteries
that
are
hid
in
the
books
and
mayest
strive
to

likewise
he
saith
our

reflect
upon
these
words
addressed
by
him
who

morning
darkness
and
treadeth
upon
the
high
places
of
the
earth
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
is
his
name
he
saith
that
he
maketh
the
morning
darkness
by
this
is
meant
that
if
at
the
time
of
the
manifestation
of
him
who
conversed
on
sinai
anyone
were
to
regard
himself
as
the
true
morn
he
will
through
the
might
and
power
of
god
be
turned
into
darkness
he
truly
is
the
false
dawn
though
believing
himself
to
be
the
true
one
woe
unto
him
and
woe
unto
such
as
follow
him
without
a
clear
token
from
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
isaiah
saith
the
lord
alone
shall
be
exalted
in
that
day
concerning
the
greatness
of
the
revelation
he
saith
enter
into
the
rock
and
hide
thee
in
the
dust
for
fear
of
the
lord
and
for
the
glory
of
his
majesty
and
in
another
connection
he
saith
the
wilderness
and
the
solitary
place
shall
be
glad
for
them
and
the
desert
shall
rejoice
and
blossom
as
the
rose
it
shall
blossom
abundantly
and
rejoice
even
with
joy
and
singing
the
glory
of
lebanon
shall
be
given
unto
it
the
splendor
of
carmel
and
sharon
they
shall
see
the
glory
of
the
lord
and
the
splendor
of
our
god
these
passages
stand
in
need
of
no
commentary
they
are
shining
and
manifest
as
the
sun
and
glowing
and
luminous
as
light
itself
every
person
is
led
by
the
fragrance
of
these
words
unto
the
garden
of
understanding
and
attaineth
unto
that
from
which
most
men
are
veiled
and
debarred
say
fear
god
o
people
and
follow
not
the
doubts
of
such
as
shout
aloud
who
have
broken
the
covenant
of
god
and
his
testament
and
denied
his
mercy
that
hath
preceded
all
that
are
in
the
heavens
and
all
that
are
on
earth
and
likewise
he
saith
say
to
them
that
are
of
a
fearful
heart
be
strong
fear
not
behold
your
god
this
blessed
verse
is
a
proof
of
the
greatness
of
the
revelation
and
of
the
greatness
of
the
cause
inasmuch
as
the
blast
of
the
trumpet
must
needs
spread
confusion
throughout
the
world
and
fear
and
trembling
amongst
all
men
well
is
it
with
him
who
hath
been
illumined
with
the
light
of
trust
and
detachment
the
tribulations
of
that
day
will
not
hinder
or
alarm
him
thus
hath
the
tongue
of
utterance
spoken
as
bidden
by
him
who
is
the
he
verily
is
the
strong
the
the
the
almighty
it
is
now
incumbent
upon
them
who
are
endowed
with
a
hearing
ear
and
a
seeing
eye
to
ponder
these
sublime
words
in
each
of
which
the
oceans
of
inner
meaning
and
explanation
are
hidden
that
haply
the
words
uttered
by
him
who
is
the
lord
of
revelation
may
enable
his
servants
to
attain
with
the
utmost
joy
and
radiance
unto
the
supreme
goal
and
most
sublime
of
this
voice
o
wert
thou
to
perceive
be
it
less
than
a
needle
s
eye
the
breaths
of
mine
utterance
thou
wouldst
abandon
the
world
and
all
that
is
therein
and
wouldst
set
thy
face
towards
the
lights
of
the
countenance
of
the
desired
one
briefly
in
the
sayings
of
him
who
is
the
spirit
jesus
unnumbered
significances
lie
concealed
unto
many
things
did
he
refer
but
as
he
found
none
possessed
of
a
hearing
ear
or
a
seeing
eye
he
chose
to
conceal
most
of
these
things
even
as
he
saith
but
ye
can
not
bear
them
now
that
of
revelation
saith
that
on
that
day
he
who
is
the
promised
one
will
reveal
the
things
which
are
to
come
accordingly
in
the
and
in
the
tablets
to
the
kings
and
in
the
ís
and
in
the
ád
most
of
the
things
which
have
come
to
pass
on
this
earth
have
been
announced
and
prophesied
by
the
most
sublime
pen
in
the
the

following
verse
hath
been

down
o

beseecheth
thee
and
imploreth
thee
by
the
lights
of

with
great
joy
o
land
of
tá
ṭihrán
for
god
hath
made
thee
the
dayspring
of
his
light
inasmuch
as
within
thee
was
born
the
manifestation
of
his
glory
be
thou
glad
for
this
name
that
hath
been
conferred
upon
name
through
which
the
daystar
of
grace
hath
shed
its
splendor
through
which
both
earth
and
heaven
have
been
illumined
erelong
will
the
state
of
affairs
within
thee
be
changed
and
the
reins
of
power
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
people
verily
thy
lord
is
the
his
authority
embraceth
all
things
rest
thou
assured
in
the
gracious
favor
of
thy
lord

eye
of
his
shall
everlastingly
be
directed
towards
thee
the
day
is
approaching
when
thy
agitation
will
have
been
transmuted
into
peace
and
quiet
calm
thus
hath
it
been
decreed
in
the
wondrous
book
and
likewise
in
the
ád
and
in
the
tablet
of
the
king
of
paris
napoleon
iii
and
in
other
tablets
there
hath
been
revealed
that
which
will
lead
every
person
to
testify
unto
the
power
and
the
majesty
and
the
wisdom
of
be
his
glory
were
men
to
observe
with
the
eye
of
justice
they
would
be
made
aware
of
the
secret
of
this
blessed
verse
neither
is
there
a
thing
green
or
sere
but
it
is
noted
in
a
distinct
writing
and
would
comprehend
it
on
this
day
however
men
s
repudiation
of
the
truth
hath
prevented
them
from
understanding
what
hath
been
sent
down
in
truth
by
him
who
is
the
revealer
the
ancient
of
days
gracious
god
perspicuous
signs
have
appeared
on
every
side
and
yet
men
are
for
the
most
part
deprived
of
the
privilege
of
beholding
and
of
comprehending
them
we
beseech
god
to
bestow
his
aid
that
all
men
may
recognize
the
pearls
that
lie
hid
within
the
shells
of
the
most
great
ocean
and
exclaim
praised
be
thou
o
god
of
the
world
o
concourse
of
the
observe
and
reflect
upon
the
billows
of
the
ocean
of
the
utterance
and
knowledge
of
god
so
that
ye
may
testify
with
your
inner
and
outer
tongues
that
with
him
is
the
knowledge
of
all
that
is
in
the
book
nothing
escapeth
his
knowledge
he
verily
hath
manifested
that
which
was
hidden
when
he
upon
his
return
mounted
the
throne
of
the
bayán
all
that
hath
been
sent
down
hath
and
will
come
to
pass
word
for
word
upon
earth
no
possibility
is
left
for
anyone
either
to
turn
aside
or
protest
as
fairness
however
is
disgraced
and
concealed
most
men
speak
as
prompted
by
their
own
idle
fancies
o
god
my
god
debar
not
thy
servants
from
turning
their
faces
towards
the
light
of
certitude
that
hath
dawned
above
the
horizon
of
thy
will
and
suffer
them
not
to
be
deprived
o
my
god
of
the
oceans
of
thy
signs
they
o
my
lord
are
thy
servants
in
thy
cities
and
thy
slaves
in
thy
lands
if
thou
hast
not
mercy
upon
them
who
then
will
show
them
mercy
take
thou
o
my
god
the
hands
of
such
as
have
been
drowned
in
the
sea
of
idle
fancies
and
deliver
them
by
thy
power
and
thy
sovereignty
save
them
then
with
the
arms
of
thy
might
powerful
art
thou
to
do
what
thou
willest
and
in
thy
right
hand
are
the
reins
of
all
that
is
in
the
heavens
and
all
that
is
on
earth
in
like
manner
the
primal
point
saith
behold
ye
him
with
his
own
eyes
were
ye
to
behold
him
with
the
eyes
of
another
ye
would
never
recognize
and
know
him
this
referreth
to
naught
else
except
this
most
great
revelation
well
is
it
with
them
that
judge
fairly
and
likewise
he
saith
the
germ
that
holdeth
within
itself
the
potentialities
of
the
revelation
that
is
to
come
is
endowed
with
a
potency
superior
to
the
combined
forces
of
the
whole
of
the
bayán
these
of
the
bayán
and
of
the
books
of
former
times
have
been
repeatedly
mentioned
under
divers
names
in
numerous
books
that
perchance
men
might
judge
equitably
that
which
hath
arisen
and
shone
forth
above
the
horizon
of
the
will
of
god
the
lord
of
the
mighty
throne
o
tell
the
people
of
the
bayán
ponder
ye
these
blessed
words
he
saith
the
whole
of
the
bayán
is
only
a
leaf
amongst
the
leaves
of
his
be
fair
o
people
and
be
not
of
such
as
are
accounted
as
lost
in
the
book
of
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
the
blessed
standeth
in
this
day
before
thy
face
laden
with
heavenly
with
new
and
wondrous
fruits
gaze
on
it
detached
from
all
else
save
it
thus
hath
the
tongue
of
might
and
power
spoken
at
this
spot
which
god
hath
adorned
with
the
footsteps
of
his
most
great
name
and
mighty
announcement
and
likewise
he
saith
ere
nine
will
have
elapsed
from
the
inception
of
this
cause
the
realities
of
the
created
things
will
not
be
made
manifest
all
that
thou
hast
as
yet
seen
is
but
the
stage
from
the
moist
germ
until
we
clothed
it
with
flesh
be
patient
until
thou
beholdest
a
new
creation
say
blessed
therefore
be
god
the
most
excellent
of
makers
and
likewise
he
hath
said
regarding
the
power
of
this
revelation
lawful
is
it
for
him
whom
god
will
make
manifest
to
reject
him
who
is
greatest
on
earth
inasmuch
as
such
a
one
is
but
a
creature
in
his
grasp
and
all
things
adore
him
after
ḥin
a
cause
shall
be
given
unto
you
which
ye
shall
come
to
know
and
also
he
saith
know
thou
with
absolute
certainty
and
through
the
firmly
established
and
most
irrevocable
decree
that
be
his
glory
and
magnified
be
his
might
and
sanctified
be
his
holiness
and
glorified
be
his
grandeur
and
lauded
be
his
ways
maketh
each
thing
to
be
known
through
its
own
self
who
then
can
know
him
through
any
one
except
himself
and
further
he
and
glorified
be
he
beware
beware
lest
in
the
days
of
his
revelation
the
vahíd
of
the
bayán
eighteen
letters
of
the
living
shut
thee
not
out
as
by
a
veil
from
him
inasmuch
as
this
vahíd
is
but
a
creature
in
his
sight
and
beware
beware
that
the
words
sent
down
in
the
bayán
shut
thee
not
out
as
by
a
veil
from
him
and
again
be
look
not
upon
him
with
any
eye
except
his
own
for
whosoever
looketh
upon
him
with
his
eye
will
recognize
him
otherwise
he
will
be
veiled
from
him
shouldst
thou
seek
god
and
his
presence
seek
thou
him
and
gaze
upon
him
and
likewise
he
saith
better
is
it
for
thee
to
recite
but
one
of
the
verses
of
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
than
to
set
down
the
whole
of
the
bayán
for
on
that
day
that
one
verse
can
save
thee
whereas
the
entire
bayán
can
not
save
thee
say
o
people
of
the
bayán
be
fair
be
fair
and
again
be
fair
be
fair
be
ye
not
of
them
who
have
made
mention
of
the
manifestation
of
the
cause
of
god
in
the
daytime
and
in
the
night
season
and
who
when
he
through
his
grace
appeared
and
when
the
horizon
of
revelation
was
illumined
pronounced
against
him
such
a
judgment
as
hath
provoked
the
lamentations
of
the
inmates
of
the
kingdom
and
of
the
realm
of
glory
and
of
such
as
have
circled
about
the
will
of
god
the
the
meditate
upon
these
sublime
words
he
saith
i
verily
am
a
believer
in
him
and
in
his
faith
and
in
his
book
and
in
his
testimonies
and
in
his
ways
and
in
all
that
proceedeth
from
him
concerning
them
i
glory
in
my
kinship
with
him
and
pride
myself
on
my
belief
in
him
and
likewise
he
saith
o
congregation
of
the
bayán
and
all
who
are
therein
recognize
ye
the
limits
imposed
upon
you
for
such
a
one
as
the
point
of
the
bayán
himself
hath
believed
in
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
before
all
things
were
created
therein
verily
do
i
glory
before
all
who
are
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
earth
by
god
all
the
atoms
of
the
universe
groan
and
lament
at
the
cruelty
perpetrated
by
the
froward
among
the
people
of
the
bayán
whither
are
gone
they
who
are
endued
with
insight
and
hearing
we
beseech
and
glorified
be
summon
them
and
exhort
them
unto
that
which
will
profit
them
and
withhold
them
from
that
which
will
harm
them
he
in
truth
is
the
strong
the
the
almighty
and
likewise
he
saith
suffer
not
yourselves
to
be
shut
out
as
by
a
veil
from
god
after
he
hath
revealed
himself
for
all
that
hath
been
exalted
in
the
bayán
is
but
as
a
ring
upon
my
hand
and
i
myself
am
verily
but
a
ring
upon
the
hand
of
him
whom
god
shall
make
be
his
mention
he
turneth
it
as
he
pleaseth
for
whatsoever
he
pleaseth
and
through
whatsoever
he
pleaseth
he
verily
is
the
help
in
peril
the
most
high
and
likewise
he
saith
were
he
to
make
of
every
one
on
earth
a
prophet
all
would
in
very
truth
be
accounted
as
prophets
in
the
sight
of
god
and
likewise
he
saith
in
the
day
of
the
revelation
of
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
all
that
dwell
on
earth
will
be
equal
in
his
estimation
whomsoever
he
ordaineth
as
a
prophet
he
verily
hath
been
a
prophet
from
the
beginning
that
hath
no
beginning
and
will
thus
remain
until
the
end
that
hath
no
end
inasmuch
as
this
is
an
act
of
god
and
whosoever
is
made
a
vicegerent
by
him
shall
be
a
vicegerent
in
all
the
worlds
for
this
is
an
act
of
god
for
the
will
of
god
can
in
no
wise
be
revealed
except
through
his
will
nor
his
wish
be
manifested
save
through
his
wish
he
verily
is
the
the
the
briefly
in
every
instance
he
hath
stated
that
which
is
conducive
to
the
conversion
the
advancement
the
exaltation
and
the
guidance
of
men
a
few
unfair
ones
however
have
become
a
veil
and
an
insurmountable
barrier
and
debarred
the
people
from
turning
towards
the
lights
of
his
countenance
we
pray
god
to
cast
them
out
by
his
sovereignty
and
seize
on
them
with
his
seizing
power
he
verily
is
the
lord
of
strength
the
mighty
the
and
likewise
he
saith
be
his
the
sun
were
unnumbered
mirrors
to
be
placed
before
it
each
would
according
to
its
capacity
reflect
the
splendor
of
that
sun
and
were
none
to
be
placed
before
it
it
would
still
continue
to
rise
and
set
and
the
mirrors
alone
would
be
veiled
from
its
light
i
verily
have
not
fallen
short
of
my
duty
to
admonish
that
people
and
to
devise
means
whereby
they
may
turn
towards
god
their
lord
and
believe
in
god
their
creator
if
on
the
day
of
his
revelation
all
that
are
on
earth
bear
him
allegiance
mine
inmost
being
will
rejoice
inasmuch
as
all
will
have
attained
the
summit
of
their
existence
and
will
have
been
brought
face
to
face
with
their
beloved
and
will
have
recognized
to
the
fullest
extent
attainable
in
the
world
of
being
the
splendor
of
him
who
is
the
desire
of
their
hearts
if
not
my
soul
will
indeed
be
saddened
i
truly
have
nurtured
all
things
for
this
purpose
how
then
can
anyone
be
veiled
from
him
for
this
have
i
called
upon
god
and
will
continue
to
call
upon
him
he
verily
is
nigh
ready
to
answer
and
likewise
he
saith
they
will
even
refuse
unto
that
tree
which
is
neither
of
the
east
nor
of
the
west
the
name
believer
for
were
they
so
to
name
him
they
would
fail
to
sadden
him
hath
thine
ear
o
world
heard
with
what
helplessness
these
words
were
revealed
from
the
dayspring
of
the
will
of
him
who
is
the
of
all
names
he
saith
i
have
educated
all
men
that
they
may
recognize
this
revelation
and
yet
the
people
of
the
bayán
refuse
to
concede
even
the
name
believer
to
that
blessed
tree
that
belongeth
neither
to
the
east
nor
to
the
west
alas
alas
for
the
things
which
have
befallen
me
by
god
there
befell
me
at
the
hands
of
him
whom
i
have
nurtured
mírzá
yaḥyá
by
day
and
by
night
what
hath
caused
the
holy
spirit
and
the
dwellers
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
grandeur
of
god
the
lord
of
this
wondrous
day
to
lament
likewise
refuting
certain
disbelievers
he
saith
for
none
knoweth
the
time
of
the
revelation
except
god
whenever
it
appeareth
all
must
acknowledge
the
point
of
truth
and
render
thanks
unto
god
they
that
have
turned
aside
from
me
have
spoken
even
as
the
followers
of
john
the
baptist
spoke
for
they
too
protested
against
him
who
was
the
spirit
jesus
saying
the
dispensation
of
john
hath
not
yet
ended
wherefore
hast
thou
come
now
too
they
that
have
repudiated
us
though
they
have
never
known
us
and
have
been
at
all
times
ignorant
of
the
fundamentals
of
this
cause
knowing
not
from
whom
it
proceeded
or
what
it
signifieth
have
spoken
that
which
hath
made
all
created
things
to
sigh
and
lament
by
my
life
the
mute
can
never
confront
the
one
who
incarnateth
in
himself
the
kingdom
of
utterance
fear
god
o
people
and
peruse
then
that
which
hath
been
sent
down
with
truth
in
the
eighth
chapter
of
the
sixth
vahíd
of
the
bayán
and
be
not
of
such
as
have
turned
aside
he
likewise
hath
commanded
once
every
nineteen
days
this
chapter
should
be
read
that
haply
they
may
not
be
veiled
in
the
time
of
the
revelation
of
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
by
considerations
foreign
to
the
verses
which
have
been
and
are
still
the
weightiest
of
all
proofs
and
testimonies
john
son
of
zacharias
said
what
my
forerunner
hath
said
saying
repent
ye
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
i
indeed
baptize
you
with
water
unto
repentance
but
he
that
cometh
after
me
is
mightier
than
i
whose
shoes
i
am
not
worthy
to
bear
wherefore
hath
my
forerunner
as
a
sign
of
submissiveness
and
humility
said
the
whole
of
the
bayán
is
only
a
leaf
amongst
the
leaves
of
his
paradise
and
likewise
he
saith
i
am
the
first
to
adore
him
and
pride
myself
on
my
kinship
with
him
and
yet
o
men
the
people
of
the
bayán
have
acted
in
such
a
manner
that
and
and
asbáhí
have
sought
and
still
seek
refuge
with
god
against
such
deeds
this
wronged
one
hath
in
the
face
of
all
religions
busied
himself
day
and
night
with
the
things
that
are
conducive
unto
the
exaltation
of
the
cause
of
god
whereas
those
men
have
clung
unto
that
which
is
the
cause
of
humiliation
and
injury
and
likewise
he
saith
recognize
him
by
his
verses
the
greater
your
neglect
in
seeking
to
know
him
the
more
grievously
will
ye
be
veiled
in
fire
o
ye
among
the
people
of
the
bayán
that
have
turned
aside
from
me
ponder
upon
these
most
sublime
words
that
have
proceeded
from
the
wellspring
of
the
utterance
of
him
who
is
the
point
of
knowledge
hearken
ye
at
this
moment
unto
these
words
he
saith
on
that
day
the
daystar
of
truth
will
address
the
people
of
the
bayán
and
will
recite
this
súrih
of
the
qur
án
say
o
ye
unbelievers
i
worship
not
that
which
ye
worship
and
ye
do
not
worship
that
which
i
worship
i
shall
never
worship
that
which
ye
worship
neither
will
ye
worship
that
which
i
worship
to
you
be
your
religion
to
me
my
gracious
god
notwithstanding
these
lucid
statements
and
these
shining
and
luminous
tokens
all
are
occupied
with
their
vain
imaginings
and
are
unaware
of
and
veiled
from
the
desired
one
o
ye
that
have
gone
astray
awake
from
the
sleep
of
heedlessness
and
give
ear
unto
these
words
of
my
forerunner
he
saith
the
tree
of
affirmation
by
turning
aside
from
him
is
accounted
as
the
tree
of
denial
and
the
tree
of
denial
by
turning
towards
him
is
accounted
as
the
tree
of
affirmation
and
likewise
he
saith
should
anyone
lay
claim
unto
a
revelation
and
fail
to
produce
any
proof
do
not
protest
and
sadden
him
not
briefly
this
wronged
one
hath
night
and
day
been
uttering
the
words
say
o
ye
unbelievers
that
haply
this
may
be
the
means
of
awakening
the
people
and
may
adorn
them
with
the
adornment
of
fairness
and
now
meditate
upon
these
words
which
diffuse
the
breath
of
despair
in
his
sorrowful
invocation
unto
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
he
saith
glorified
art
thou
o
my
god
bear
thou
witness
that
through
this
book
i
have
covenanted
with
all
created
things
concerning
the
mission
of
him
whom
thou
shalt
make
manifest
ere
the
covenant
concerning
mine
own
mission
had
been
established
sufficient
witness
art
thou
and
they
that
have
believed
in
thy
signs
thou
verily
sufficest
me
in
thee
have
i
placed
my
trust
and
thou
verily
takest
count
of
all
things
in
another
connection
he
saith
o
mirrors
look
ye
upon
the
sun
of
truth
ye
verily
depend
upon
it
were
ye
to
perceive
it
ye
are
all
as
fishes
moving
in
the
waters
of
the
sea
veiling
yourselves
therefrom
and
yet
asking
what
it
is
on
which
ye
depend
and
likewise
he
saith
i
complain
unto
thee
o
mirror
of
my
generosity
against
all
the
other
mirrors
all
look
upon
me
through
their
own
colors
these
words
were
sent
down
from
the
source
of
the
revelation
of
the
and
were
addressed
to
siyyid
javád
known
as
karbilá
í
god
testifieth
and
the
world
beareth
me
witness
that
this
siyyid
stood
by
this
wronged
one
and
even
wrote
a
detailed
refutation
against
them
that
turned
aside
from
me
two
communications
moreover
in
which
he
hath
borne
witness
unto
the
revelation
of
the
true
one
and
in
which
the
evidences
of
his
turning
away
from
all
else
but
him
are
clear
and
manifest
have
been
sent
by
us
to
alí
the
handwriting
of
the
siyyid
is
unmistakable
and
is
known
unto
everyone
our
purpose
in
doing
this
was
that
perchance
they
that
have
denied
us
might
attain
unto
the
living
waters
of
acknowledgment
and
such
as
have
turned
aside
be
illumined
with
the
light
of
conversion
god
is
my
witness
that
this
wronged
one
hath
had
no
purpose
except
to
convey
the
word
of
god
blessed
are
the
and
woe
betide
them
that
have
turned
aside
they
that
have
turned
away
from
me
have
schemed
many
a
time
and
acted
deceitfully
in
divers
ways
they
have
on
one
occasion
secured
a
picture
of
this
siyyid
and
pasted
it
on
a
sheet
with
that
of
others
surmounted
by
the
portrait
of
mírzá
yaḥyá
briefly
they
have
seized
upon
every
means
in
order
to
repudiate
the
true
one
say
the
true
one
is
come
evident
as
the
shining
sun
o
pity
that
he
should
have
come
into
the
city
of
the
blind
the
siyyid
admonished
the
deniers
and
summoned
them
unto
the
most
sublime
horizon
but
failed
to
impress
these
stones
that
can
take
no
imprint
concerning
him
they
have
said
things
against
which
he
sought
refuge
with
be
his
glory
the
supplications
which
he
hath
sent
to
this
holy
court
are
now
in
our
possession
happy
are
the
ponder
now
upon
the
complaint
of
the
primal
point
against
the
mirrors
that
haply
men
may
be
awakened
and
may
turn
from
the
left
hand
of
idle
fancies
and
imaginings
unto
the
right
hand
of
faith
and
certitude
and
may
be
made
cognizant
of
that
wherefrom
they
are
veiled
it
is
indeed
for
the
purpose
of
recognizing
this
most
great
cause
that
they
have
come
out
of
the
world
of
into
the
world
of
being
and
likewise
he
saith
consecrate
thou
o
my
god
the
whole
of
this
tree
unto
him
that
from
it
may
be
revealed
all
the
fruits
created
by
god
within
it
for
him
through
whom
god
hath
willed
to
reveal
all
that
he
pleaseth
by
thy
glory
i
have
not
wished
that
this
tree
should
ever
bear
any
branch
leaf
or
fruit
that
would
fail
to
bow
down
before
him
on
the
day
of
his
revelation
or
refuse
to
laud
thee
through
him
as
beseemeth
the
glory
of
his
revelation
and
the
sublimity
of
his
most
sublime
concealment
and
shouldst
thou
behold
o
my
god
any
branch
leaf
or
fruit
upon
me
that
hath
failed
to
bow
down
before
him
on
the
day
of
his
revelation
cut
it
off
o
my
god
from
that
tree
for
it
is
not
of
me
nor
shall
it
return
unto
me
o
people
of
the
bayán
i
swear
by
god
this
wronged
one
hath
had
no
other
intention
except
to
manifest
the
cause
he
was
commissioned
to
reveal
were
ye
to
incline
your
inner
ears
unto
him
ye
would
hear
from
every
limb
and
member
and
vein
and
even
from
every
single
hair
of
this
wronged
one
that
which
would
stir
and
enrapture
the
concourse
on
high
and
the
world
of
creation
o
hádí
the
blind
fanaticism
of
former
times
hath
withheld
the
hapless
creatures
from
the
straight
path
meditate
on
the
ih
sect
for
twelve
hundred
years
they
have
cried
o
qá
im
until
in
the
end
all
pronounced
the
sentence
of
his
death
and
caused
him
to
suffer
martyrdom
notwithstanding
their
belief
in
and
their
acceptance
and
acknowledgment
of
the
true
be
his
of
the
seal
of
the
prophets
and
of
the
chosen
ones
it
is
now
necessary
to
reflect
a
while
that
haply
that
which
hath
come
between
the
true
one
and
his
creatures
may
be
discovered
and
the
deeds
which
have
been
the
cause
of
protest
and
denial
be
made
known
o
hádí
we
have
heard
the
moaning
of
the
pulpits
which
as
attested
by
all
the
divines
of
the
age
of
this
revelation
have
ascended
and
from
which
they
have
cursed
the
true
one
and
caused
such
things
to
befall
him
who
is
the
essence
of
being
and
his
companions
as
neither
the
eye
nor
the
ear
of
the
world
hath
seen
or
heard
thou
hast
now
summoned
and
art
still
summoning
the
people
claiming
to
be
his
vicegerent
and
mirror
despite
thine
ignorance
of
this
cause
as
a
result
of
thy
not
having
been
in
our
company
every
one
of
this
people
well
knoweth
that
siyyid
muḥammad
was
but
one
of
our
servants
in
the
days
when
as
requested
by
the
imperial
ottoman
government
we
proceeded
to
their
capital
he
accompanied
us
subsequently
he
committed
that
swear
by
caused
the
pen
of
the
most
high
to
weep
and
his
tablet
to
groan
we
therefore
cast
him
out
whereupon
he
joined
mírzá
yaḥyá
and
did
what
no
tyrant
hath
ever
done
we
abandoned
him
and
said
unto
him
begone
o
heedless
one
after
these
words
had
been
uttered
he
joined
the
order
of
the
mawlavis
and
remained
in
their
company
until
the
time
when
we
were
summoned
to
depart
o
hádí
suffer
not
thyself
to
become
the
instrument
for
the
dissemination
of
new
superstitions
and
refuse
to
set
up
once
again
a
sect
similar
to
that
of
the
ihs
reflect
how
great
the
amount
of
blood
which
hath
been
spilt
thou
amongst
others
who
hast
laid
claim
to
knowledge
and
likewise
the
ih
divines
have
one
and
all
in
the
first
and
ensuing
years
cursed
the
true
one
and
decreed
that
his
most
holy
blood
be
shed
fear
god
o
hádí
be
not
willing
that
men
be
again
afflicted
with
the
vain
imaginings
of
former
times
fear
god
and
be
not
of
them
that
act
unjustly
in
these
days
we
have
heard
that
thou
hast
striven
to
lay
hands
on
and
destroy
every
copy
of
the
bayán
this
wronged
one
requesteth
thee
to
renounce
for
the
sake
of
god
this
intention
thine
intelligence
and
judgment
have
never
excelled
nor
do
they
now
excel
the
intelligence
and
judgment
of
him
who
is
the
prince
of
the
world
god
testifieth
and
beareth
me
witness
that
this
wronged
one
hath
not
perused
the
bayán
nor
been
acquainted
with
its
contents
this
much
however
is
known
and
is
clear
and
indubitable
that
he
hath
ordained
the
book
of
the
bayán
to
be
the
foundation
of
his
works
fear
god
and
meddle
not
in
matters
which
far
transcend
thee
for
twelve
hundred
years
they
that
resemble
thee
have
afflicted
the
hapless
ihs
in
the
pit
of
vain
fancies
and
idle
imaginings
finally
there
appeared
on
the
day
of
judgment
things
against
which
the
oppressors
of
old
have
sought
refuge
with
the
true
one
apprehend
now
the
cry
of
him
who
is
the
point
as
raised
by
his
utterance
he
supplicateth
god
that
if
there
should
appear
from
this
is
his
blessed
fruit
or
leaf
or
branch
that
would
fail
to
believe
in
him
god
should
cut
it
off
forthwith
and
likewise
he
saith
should
any
one
make
a
statement
and
fail
to
support
it
by
any
proof
reject
him
not
and
yet
now
though
supported
by
a
hundred
books
thou
hast
rejected
him
and
rejoicest
therein
again
i
repeat
and
plead
with
thee
to
carefully
scrutinize
that
which
hath
been
revealed
the
breezes
of
utterance
in
this
revelation
are
not
to
be
compared
with
those
of
former
ages
this
wronged
one
hath
been
perpetually
afflicted
and
found
no
place
of
safety
in
which
he
could
peruse
either
the
writings
of
the
most
exalted
one
the
báb
or
those
of
any
one
else
about
two
months
after
our
arrival
in
iráq
following
the
command
of
his
majesty
the
of
god
assist
yaḥyá
joined
us
we
said
unto
him
in
accordance
with
the
royal
command
we
have
been
sent
unto
this
place
it
is
advisable
for
thee
to
remain
in
persia
we
will
send
our
brother
mírzá
músá
to
some
other
place
as
your
names
have
not
been
mentioned
in
the
royal
decree
you
can
arise
and
render
some
service
subsequently
this
wronged
one
departed
from
and
for
two
years
withdrew
from
the
world
upon
our
return
we
found
that
he
had
not
left
and
had
postponed
his
departure
this
wronged
one
was
greatly
saddened
god
testifieth
and
beareth
us
witness
that
we
have
at
all
times
been
busied
with
the
propagation
of
this
cause
neither
chains
nor
bonds
stocks
nor
imprisonment
have
succeeded
in
withholding
us
from
revealing
our
self
in
that
land
we
forbad
all
mischief
and
all
unseemly
and
unholy
deeds
day
and
night
we
sent
forth
our
tablets
in
every
direction
we
had
no
other
purpose
except
to
edify
the
souls
of
men
and
to
exalt
the
blessed
word
we
especially
appointed
certain
ones
to
collect
the
writings
of
the
primal
point
when
this
was
accomplished
we
summoned
mírzá
yaḥyá
and
mírzá
known
as
mírzá
javád
to
meet
in
a
certain
place
conforming
with
our
instructions
they
completed
the
task
of
transcribing
two
copies
of
the
works
of
the
primal
point
i
swear
by
god
this
wronged
one
by
reason
of
his
constant
association
with
men
hath
not
looked
at
these
books
nor
gazed
with
outward
eyes
on
these
writings
when
we
departed
these
writings
were
in
the
possession
of
these
two
persons
it
was
agreed
that
mírzá
yaḥyá
should
be
entrusted
with
them
and
proceed
to
persia
and
disseminate
them
throughout
that
land
this
wronged
one
proceeded
at
the
request
of
the
ministers
of
the
ottoman
government
to
their
capital
when
we
arrived
in
mosul
we
found
that
mírzá
yaḥyá
had
left
before
us
for
that
city
and
was
awaiting
us
there
briefly
the
books
and
writings
were
left
in
while
he
himself
proceeded
to
constantinople
and
joined
these
servants
god
beareth
now
witness
unto
the
things
which
have
touched
this
wronged
one
for
after
we
had
so
arduously
striven
he
mírzá
yaḥyá
abandoned
the
writings
and
joined
the
exiles
this
wronged
one
was
for
a
long
period
overwhelmed
by
infinite
sorrows
until
such
time
when
in
pursuance
of
measures
of
which
none
but
the
one
true
god
is
aware
we
despatched
the
writings
unto
another
place
and
another
country
owing
to
the
fact
that
in
iráq
all
documents
must
every
month
be
carefully
examined
lest
they
rot
and
perish
god
however
preserved
them
and
sent
them
unto
a
place
which
he
had
previously
ordained
he
verily
is
the
protector
the
succorer
wherever
this
wronged
one
went
mírzá
yaḥyá
followed
him
thou
art
thyself
a
witness
and
well
knowest
that
whatever
hath
been
said
is
the
truth
the
siyyid
of
iṣfáhán
however
surreptitiously
duped
him
they
committed
that
which
caused
the
greatest
consternation
would
that
thou
wouldst
inquire
from
the
officials
of
the
government
concerning
the
conduct
of
mírzá
yaḥyá
in
that
land
aside
from
all
this
i
adjure
thee
by
god
the
one
the
incomparable
the
lord
of
strength
the
most
powerful
to
carefully
look
into
the
communications
addressed
in
his
name
to
the
primal
point
that
thou
mayest
behold
the
evidences
of
him
who
is
the
truth
as
clear
as
the
sun
likewise
there
proceeded
from
the
words
of
the
point
of
the
the
souls
of
all
else
but
him
be
sacrificed
for
his
which
no
veil
can
obscure
and
which
neither
the
veils
of
glory
nor
the
veils
interposed
by
such
as
have
gone
astray
can
hide
the
veils
have
verily
been
rent
asunder
by
the
finger
of
the
will
of
thy
lord
the
strong
the
the
yea
desperate
is
the
state
of
such
as
have
calumniated
me
and
envied
me
not
long
ago
it
was
stated
that
thou
hadst
ascribed
the
authorship
of
the
and
of
other
tablets
unto
others
i
swear
by
god
this
is
a
grievous
injustice
others
are
incapable
of
apprehending
their
meaning
how
much
more
of
revealing
them
was
the
bearer
of
seventy
tablets
upon
his
death
these
were
not
delivered
unto
those
for
whom
they
were
intended
but
were
entrusted
to
one
of
the
sisters
of
this
wronged
one
who
for
no
reason
whatever
had
turned
aside
from
me
god
knoweth
what
befell
his
tablets
this
sister
had
never
lived
with
us
i
swear
by
the
sun
of
truth
that
after
these
things
had
happened
she
never
saw
mírzá
yaḥyá
and
remained
unaware
of
our
cause
for
in
those
days
she
had
been
estranged
from
us
she
lived
in
one
quarter
and
this
wronged
one
in
another
as
a
token
however
of
our
our
affection
and
mercy
we
a
few
days
prior
to
our
departure
visited
her
and
her
mother
that
haply
she
might
quaff
from
the
living
waters
of
faith
and
attain
unto
that
which
would
draw
her
nigh
unto
god
in
this
day
god
well
knoweth
and
beareth
me
witness
and
she
herself
testifieth
that
i
had
no
thought
whatsoever
except
this
finally
be
unto
this
through
his
grace
and
was
adorned
with
the
adornment
of
love
after
we
were
exiled
and
had
departed
from
iráq
to
constantinople
however
news
of
her
ceased
to
reach
us
subsequent
to
our
separation
in
the
land
of
tá
ṭihrán
we
ceased
to
meet
mírzá
our
brother
and
no
special
news
reached
us
concerning
her
in
the
early
days
we
all
lived
in
one
house
which
later
on
was
sold
at
auction
for
a
negligible
sum
and
the
two
brothers
and
hisámu
purchased
it
and
divided
it
between
themselves
after
this
occurred
we
separated
from
our
brother
he
established
his
residence
close
to
the
entrance
of
whilst
we
lived
near
the
gate
of
thereafter
however
that
sister
displayed
toward
us
for
no
reason
whatever
a
hostile
attitude
this
wronged
one
held
his
peace
under
all
conditions
however
our
late
brother
mírzá
s
him
be
the
glory
of
god
and
his
peace
and
his
had
been
betrothed
to
the
most
great
branch
abdu
was
taken
by
the
sister
of
this
wronged
one
from
núr
to
her
own
house
and
from
there
sent
unto
another
place
some
of
our
companions
and
friends
in
various
places
complained
against
this
as
it
was
a
very
grievous
act
and
was
disapproved
by
all
the
loved
ones
of
god
how
strange
that
our
sister
should
have
taken
her
to
her
own
house
and
then
arranged
for
her
to
be
sent
elsewhere
in
spite
of
this
this
wronged
one
remained
and
still
remaineth
calm
and
silent
a
word
however
was
said
in
order
to
tranquilize
our
loved
ones
god
testifieth
and
beareth
me
witness
that
whatever
hath
been
said
was
the
truth
and
was
spoken
with
sincerity
none
of
our
loved
ones
whether
in
these
regions
or
in
that
country
could
believe
our
sister
capable
of
an
act
so
contrary
to
decency
affection
and
friendship
after
such
a
thing
had
occurred
they
recognizing
that
the
way
had
been
barred
conducted
themselves
in
a
manner
unto
thyself
and
others
it
must
be
evident
therefore
how
intense
was
the
grief
which
this
act
inflicted
upon
this
wronged
one
later
on
she
threw
in
her
lot
with
mírzá
yaḥyá
conflicting
reports
concerning
her
are
now
reaching
us
nor
is
it
clear
what
she
is
saying
or
doing
we
beseech
and
glorified
be
cause
her
to
turn
unto
him
and
aid
her
to
repent
before
the
door
of
his
grace
he
verily
is
the
mighty
the
forgiving
and
he
is
in
truth
the
the
pardoner
in
another
connection
he
likewise
saith
were
he
to
appear
this
very
moment
i
would
be
the
first
to
adore
him
and
the
first
to
bow
down
before
him
be
fair
o
people
the
purpose
of
the
most
exalted
one
the
báb
was
to
insure
that
the
proximity
of
the
revelation
should
not
withhold
men
from
the
divine
and
everlasting
law
even
as
the
companions
of
john
the
baptist
were
prevented
from
acknowledging
him
who
is
the
spirit
jesus
time
and
again
he
hath
said
suffer
not
the
bayán
and
all
that
hath
been
revealed
therein
to
withhold
you
from
that
essence
of
being
and
lord
of
the
visible
and
invisible
should
any
one
considering
this
binding
injunction
cling
unto
the
bayán
such
a
one
hath
verily
passed
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
blessed
and
exalted
tree
be
fair
o
people
and
be
not
of
the
heedless
and
likewise
he
saith
let
not
names
shut
you
out
as
by
a
veil
from
him
who
is
their
lord
even
the
name
of
prophet
for
such
a
name
is
but
a
creation
of
his
utterance
and
likewise
he
in
the
seventh
chapter
of
the
second
vahíd
saith
o
people
of
the
bayán
act
not
as
the
people
of
the
qur
án
have
acted
for
if
ye
do
so
the
fruits
of
your
night
will
come
to
naught
and
further
he
be
his
mention
if
thou
attainest
unto
his
revelation
and
obeyest
him
thou
wilt
have
revealed
the
fruit
of
the
bayán
if
not
thou
art
unworthy
of
mention
before
god
take
pity
upon
thyself
if
thou
aidest
not
him
who
is
the
manifestation
of
the
lordship
of
god
be
not
then
a
cause
of
sadness
unto
him
and
further
he
be
his
station
if
thou
attainest
not
unto
the
presence
of
god
grieve
not
then
the
sign
of
god
ye
will
renounce
that
which
can
profit
them
that
acknowledge
the
bayán
if
ye
renounce
that
which
can
harm
him
i
know
however
that
ye
will
refuse
to
do
so
o
hádí
methinks
it
is
by
reason
of
these
indubitable
utterances
that
thou
hast
determined
to
blot
out
the
bayán
give
ear
unto
the
voice
of
this
wronged
one
and
renounce
this
oppression
that
hath
made
the
pillars
of
the
bayán
to
tremble
i
have
been
neither
in
nor
in
at
the
present
time
statements
have
been
circulated
among
thy
disciples
identical
with
those
made
by
the
ihs
who
have
said
that
the
qur
án
is
unfinished
these
people
also
contend
that
this
bayán
is
not
the
original
one
the
copy
in
the
handwriting
of
siyyid
ḥusayn
is
extant
as
is
also
the
copy
in
the
handwriting
of
mírzá
aḥmad
regardest
thou
as
one
wronged
he
who
in
this
world
was
never
dealt
a
single
blow
and
who
was
continually
surrounded
by
five
of
the
handmaidens
of
god
and
imputest
thou
unto
the
true
one
who
from
his
earliest
years
until
the
present
day
hath
been
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
and
been
tormented
with
the
worst
afflictions
in
the
world
such
charges
as
the
jews
did
not
ascribe
unto
christ
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
this
wronged
one
and
be
not
of
them
that
are
in
utter
loss
and
likewise
he
saith
how
many
the
fires
which
god
converteth
into
light
through
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
and
how
numerous
the
lights
which
are
turned
into
fire
through
him
i
behold
his
appearance
even
as
the
sun
in
the
midmost
heaven
and
the
disappearance
of
all
even
as
that
of
the
stars
of
the
night
by
day
hast
thou
ears
o
world
wherewith
to
hear
the
voice
of
the
true
one
and
to
judge
equitably
this
revelation
which
as
soon
as
it
appeared
sinai
exclaimed
he
that
discoursed
upon
me
is
come
with
evident
signs
and
resplendent
tokens
in
spite
of
every
heedless
one
that
hath
gone
far
astray
and
of
every
lying
calumniator
who
hath
wished
to
quench
the
light
of
god
with
his
calumnies
and
blot
out
the
signs
of
god
through
his
malice
they
verily
are
of
such
as
have
acted
unjustly
in
the
book
of
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
and
likewise
he
saith
the
bayán
is
from
beginning
to
end
the
repository
of
all
of
his
attributes
and
the
treasury
of
both
his
fire
and
his
light
great
god
the
soul
is
carried
away
by
the
fragrance
of
this
utterance
inasmuch
as
he
declareth
with
infinite
sadness
that
which
he
perceiveth
likewise
he
saith
to
the
letter
of
the
living
mullá
him
be
the
glory
of
god
and
his
haply
thou
mayest
in
eight
years
in
the
day
of
his
revelation
attain
unto
his
presence
know
thou
o
hádí
and
be
of
them
that
hearken
judge
thou
equitably
the
companions
of
god
and
the
testimonies
of
him
who
is
the
truth
have
for
the
most
part
suffered
martyrdom
thou
however
art
still
alive
how
is
it
that
thou
hast
been
spared
i
swear
by
god
it
is
because
of
thy
denial
whereas
the
martyrdom
of
the
blessed
souls
was
due
to
their
confession
every
just
and
person
will
bear
witness
unto
this
inasmuch
as
the
cause
and
motive
of
both
are
clear
and
evident
as
the
sun
and
likewise
he
addresseth
dayyán
who
was
wronged
and
suffered
martyrdom
saying
thou
shalt
recognize
thy
worth
through
the
words
of
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
he
likewise
hath
pronounced
him
to
be
the
third
letter
to
believe
in
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
through
these
words
o
thou
who
art
the
third
letter
to
believe
in
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
and
likewise
he
saith
should
god
however
be
willing
he
will
make
thee
known
through
the
words
of
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
dayyán
who
according
to
the
words
of
him
who
is
the
the
souls
of
all
else
but
him
be
sacrificed
for
his
the
repository
of
the
trust
of
the
one
true
be
his
the
treasury
of
the
pearls
of
his
knowledge
was
made
by
them
to
suffer
so
cruel
a
martyrdom
that
the
concourse
on
high
wept
and
lamented
he
it
is
whom
he
the
báb
had
taught
the
hidden
and
preserved
knowledge
and
entrusted
him
therewith
through
his
words
o
thou
who
art
named
dayyán
this
is
a
hidden
and
preserved
knowledge
we
have
entrusted
it
unto
thee
and
brought
it
to
thee
as
a
mark
of
honor
from
god
inasmuch
as
the
eye
of
thine
heart
is
pure
thou
wilt
appreciate
its
value
and
wilt
cherish
its
excellence
god
verily
hath
deigned
to
bestow
upon
the
point
of
the
bayán
a
hidden
and
preserved
knowledge
the
like
of
which
god
hath
not
sent
down
prior
to
this
revelation
more
precious
is
it
than
any
other
knowledge
in
the
estimation
of
be
he
he
verily
hath
made
it
his
testimony
even
as
he
hath
made
the
verses
to
be
his
testimony
this
oppressed
one
who
was
the
repository
of
the
knowledge
of
god
together
with
mírzá
one
of
the
relatives
of
the
primal

be
the
glory
of

and
his

and
several
others

martyrdom
through
the
decree
pronounced
by
mírzá

his
book
which
he
hath
entitled

in
thy
possession
read
it
although
thou
hast
seen
the
book
peruse
it
again
that
haply
thou
mayest
obtain
for
thyself
a
lofty
seat
beneath
the
canopy
of

flowed
from

o
thou
who
art
mentioned
as
my
friend
in
my
scriptures
and
as
my
remembrance
in
my
books
next
to
my
scriptures
and
as
my
name
in

one
together
with
dayyán
hath
been
surnamed
by
him

father
of
iniquities
and
father
of
calamities
judge
thou
fairly
how
grievous
hath
been
the
plight
of
these
oppressed
ones
and
this
notwithstanding
that
one
of
them
was
occupied
in
serving
him
whilst
the
other
was
his
guest
briefly
i
swear
by
god
the
deeds
he
committed
were
such
that
our
pen
is
ashamed
to
recount
reflect
a
while
upon
the
dishonor
inflicted
upon
the
primal
point
consider
what
hath
happened
when
this
wronged
one
after
a
retirement
of
two
years
during
which
he
wandered
through
the
deserts
and
mountains
returned
to
as
a
result
of
the
intervention
of
a
few
who
for
a
long
time
had
sought
him
in
the
wilderness
a
certain
mírzá
alí
of
came
to
see
him
and
related
before
a
large
gathering
of
people
that
which
had
been
done
affecting
the
honor
of
the
báb
which
hath
truly
overwhelmed
all
lands
with
sorrow
great
god
how
could
they
have
countenanced
this
most
grievous
betrayal
briefly
we
beseech
god
to
aid
the
perpetrator
of
this
deed
to
repent
and
return
unto
him
he
verily
is
the
helper
the
as
to
him
be
the
glory
of
god
and
his
attained
our
presence
in
accordance
with
that
which
had
been
revealed
by
the
pen
of
the
primal
point
we
pray
god
to
aid
the
heedless
to
turn
unto
him
and
such
as
have
turned
aside
to
direct
themselves
towards
him
and
them
that
have
denied
him
to
acknowledge
this
cause
which
no
sooner
did
it
appear
than
all
created
things
proclaimed
he
that
was
hidden
in
the
treasury
of
knowledge
and
inscribed
by
the

of

most
high

his
books
and

scriptures
and
his
scrolls
and

come
in
this
connection

hath
been
deemed
necessary
to
mention
such
traditions
as
have
been
recorded
regarding
the
blessed
and
honored
city
of
akká
