chapter
i
the
tall
young
lady
who
arrived
fifteen
minutes
before
the
freddy
tunbridges
was
not
taken
into
the
great
empty
but
as
though
she
were
not
to
be
of
the
party
expected
that
night
straight
upstairs
she
went
behind
the
footman
and
then
up
more
stairs
behind
a
maid
the
smart
domestic
paused
and
her
floating
muslin
streamers
cut
short
their
aÃ«rial
gyrations
subsiding
against
her
straight
black
back
as
she
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
opened
by
a
head
nurse
of
impressive
demeanour
she
stood
there
an
instant
eyeing
the
intruder
with
the
kind
of
overbearing
hauteur
that
in
these
days
does
duty
as
the
peculiar
of
the
upper
servant
being
seldom
encountered
in
england
among
even
the
older
generation
of
the
governing
class
too
late
to
see
the
baby
miss
he
asleep
i
know
but
the
others
are
expecting
me
are
they
question
hardly
necessary
perhaps
with
the
air
full
of
cries
from
beyond
the
screen
yes
waiting
promised
cut
short
by
the
nurse
saying
sharply
so
much
noise
miss
sara
but
the
presiding
genius
of
the
tunbridge
nursery
opened
the
door
a
little
wider
and
stood
aside
handsome
compensation
for
her
studied
coldness
was
offered
in
the
shrill
shrieks
of
joy
with
which
a
little
girl
and
a
very
small
boy
celebrated
the
lady
entrance
she
for
her
part
joined
the
austere
nurse
in
saying
sh
and
in
simulating
consternation
at
the
spectacle
behind
the
screen
miss
sara
jumping
up
and
down
in
the
middle
of
her
bed
with
wild
brown
hair
swirling
madly
about
a
laughing
but
mutinous
face
the
visitor
hurrying
forward
received
the
impetuous
little
girl
in
her
arms
while
the
nurse
described
her
own
sentiments
of
horror
and
detestation
of
such
performances
and
hinted
vaguely
at
retribution
that
might
with
safety
be
looked
for
no
later
than
the
morrow
nobody
listened
miss
levering
nodded
smiling
across
nightgowned
figure
to
the
little
boy
hanging
over
the
side
of
the
neighbouring
cot
but
he
kept
remonstrating
always
go
to
her
first
the
lady
drew
a
flat
shiny
wooden
box
out
of
the
inside
pocket
of
her
cloak
the
little
girl
seized
it
rapturously
did
you
only
bring
sara
bock
wailed
the
smaller
tunbridge
told
you
expecially
we
wanted
bocks
got
two
pockets
and
i
got
two
bocks
let
me
give
him
his
sara
darling
but
darling
dropped
her
own
the
better
to
cling
round
the
neck
of
the
giver
naturally
master
cecil
sounded
the
horn
of
indignation
commanded
his
sister
you
know
his
little
lordship
never
did
that
and
to
emphasize
this
satirical
appeal
to
a
higher
standard
of
manners
sara
loosened
her
arms
an
instant
but
still
holding
to
the
visitor
with
one
hand
she
picked
up
the
pillow
and
deftly
hurled
it
at
the
neighbouring
cot
extinguishing
the
little
boy
through
the
general
recriminations
that
ensued
the
culprit
cried
with
shrill
rapture
gladys
never
lady
gladys
was
a
little
lady
and
never
did
the
merry
eyes
shamelessly
invited
miss
levering
to
mock
at
dampney
former
charges
but
the
visitor
detached
herself
from
miss
sara
and
wishing
apparently
to
ingratiate
herself
with
the
offended
majesty
of
the
nurse
miss
levering
said
gravely
over
her
shoulder
lie
down
sara
and
be
a
good
girl
sara
reply
to
that
was
to
what
she
called
up
and
down
on
her
knees
and
emit
shrill
squeals
of
some
pleasurable
emotion
not
defined
this
too
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
dampney
had
picked
up
the
pillow
and
was
advancing
upon
miss
sara
with
an
expression
calculated
to
shake
the
stoutest
heart
it
obviously
shook
the
visitor
sara
if
you
do
be
quiet
and
let
nurse
cover
you
up
she
wo
want
me
to
stay
miss
levering
actually
got
up
off
the
little
boy
bed
and
stood
as
though
ready
to
carry
the
obnoxious
suggestion
into
instant
effect
sara
darted
under
the
bedclothes
like
a
rabbit
into
its
burrow
the
rigid
woman
without
words
restored
the
tousled
pillow
to
the
head
of
the
bed
extracted
miss
sara
from
her
with
one
hand
smoothed
out
the
rebellious
legs
with
the
other
covered
the
child
firmly
over
and
tucked
the
bedclothes
in
the
use
of
all
that
mother
always
does
it
over
again
know
very
well
she
been
and
done
it
once
already
coming
again
if
father
does
need
her
a
whole
big
needing
her
so
you
need
think
she
can
come
twice
to
say
to
a
like
you
ought
to
say
a
amended
sara
during
this
interchange
master
cecil
was
complaining
to
the
visitor
ca
see
you
with
that
thing
all
round
your
head
take
it
off
his
sister
agreed
and
when
the
lady
had
unwound
her
lace
scarf
the
coat
and
you
have
to
sit
on
my
bed
this
time
my
turn
as
the
visitor
divested
herself
of
the
long
garment
you
pretty
observed
the
gallant
young
gentleman
over
the
way
seeming
not
to
have
heard
that
these
effects
do
appeal
to
little
boys
sara
silently
craned
her
neck
even
the
high
and
mighty
dampney
in
the
surreptitious
way
of
the
superior
servant
without
seeming
to
look
was
covertly
taking
in
the
vision
that
the
cloak
had
hitherto
obscured
the
little
girl
followed
with
critical
eyes
the
movement
of
the
tall
figure
the
graceful
fall
of
the
clinging
black
lace
gown
embroidered
in
yellow
irises
the
easy
bend
of
the
small
waist
in
its
jewelled
belt
of
yellow
the
growing
approval
in
the
little
face
culminated
in
an
ecstatic
let
me
see
what
on
your
neck
that
new
is
it
very
old
did
know
there
were
yellow
diamonds
said
sara
are
but
these
are
sapphires
the
little
stones
round
they
diamonds
thing
is
a
pretty
shape
the
is
a
pretty
shape
it
the
flower
of
france
you
know
just
as
the
thistle
is
the
now
a
penetrating
whisper
came
from
the
other
bed
you
who
been
keeping
her
here
you
know
miss
levering
bent
her
neat
dark
head
over
the
little
girl
and
the
gleaming
jewels
swung
forward
said
cecil
in
a
tone
of
grandfatherly
disgust
like
a
wild
indian
you
said
his
sister
because
a
feather
pillow
hit
you
her
eye
never
once
left
the
glittering
gaud
see
cecil
is
younger
than
you
miss
levering
reminded
her
said
sara
with
conscious
superiority
whole
year
and
eight
months
but
even
when
i
was
young
had
sense
miss
levering
laughed
a
horrid
little
pharisee
and
as
wild
as
a
young
colt
contrary
to
received
canons
the
visitor
seemed
to
find
something
reassuring
in
the
latter
reflection
for
she
kissed
the
small
face
just
ought
to
have
seen
sara
this
morning
cecil
chuckled
with
a
generous
admiration
in
family
achievements
waked
up
early
and
sara
said
let
go
mountaineering
so
we
did
all
over
the
rocks
and
presserpittses
he
waved
his
hand
comprehensively
at
the
rugged
scenery
of
the
course
we
had
to
pile
up
the
chairs
and
things
his
sister
explained
the
coal
scuttle
we
made
snow
mountains
out
of
the
pillows
when
the
chairs
wobbled
the
coal
and
the
pillows
kept
falling
about
it
was
quite
a
real
avalanche
sara
said
conversationally
should
think
so
agreed
the
guest
and
it
was
glorious
when
sara
excaped
to
the
top
of
the
wardrobe
the
w
miss
levering
gasped
we
were
having
the
most
perfectly
fascinating
time
sara
took
up
the
tale
but
cecil
suddenly
sat
bolt
upright
his
little
face
quite
pink
with
excitement
at
recollection
of
these
alpine
exploits
sara
had
come
down
off
the
wardrobe
she
been
sitting
on
the
carved
piece
she
says
that
the
schreckhorn
but
she
come
down
off
it
and
we
was
just
jumping
about
all
those
mountains
like
two
shamrocks
what
when
came
in
agreed
sara
when
we
happiest
always
comes
interfiddling
sara
mine
i
rather
like
you
said
miss
levering
laying
her
laughing
face
against
the
tousled
hair
now
cried
cecil
suddenly
beating
with
his
two
fists
on
the
counterpane
as
though
he
seen
as
much
valuable
time
wasted
as
he
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
tolerate
on
where
you
left
off
it
visit
this
time
sara
held
fast
to
her
friend
for
me
to
say
what
we
going
to
talk
about
got
to
be
alligators
said
cecil
waving
his
arms
be
alligators
i
want
to
know
more
about
doris
cecil
tone
implied
that
the
human
intelligence
could
no
lower
sink
i
expect
you
like
her
better
than
you
do
us
you
think
i
ought
to
like
my
niece
best
from
cecil
said
we
belonged
to
you
too
observed
miss
sara
course
all
aunts
she
pursued
like
their
nieces
so
they
inquired
miss
levering
with
an
elaborate
air
of
innocence
did
say
to
me
said
cecil
with
the
air
of
one
who
makes
a
useful
discovery
she
went
to
you
the
minute
i
threw
the
pillow
was
just
to
save
me
from
being
dead
it
is
a
proper
when
she
does
hug
you
hug
you
when
i
go
but
a
better
plan
than
that
occurred
to
cecil
he
flung
down
the
covers
with
the
decision
of
one
called
to
set
about
some
urgent
business
i
simply
wo
have
you
catching
cold
before
the
words
were
out
of
miss
levering
mouth
he
had
tumbled
out
of
bed
and
leapt
into
her
lap
he
clasped
his
arms
round
her
neck
with
an
air
of
rapturous
devotion
but
what
he
said
was
on
the
alligator
no
go
protested
sara
pushing
him
with
hands
and
feet
you
really
will
have
nurse
back
that
horrid
thought
coerced
the
prudent
sara
to
endurance
of
the
interloping
brother
and
now
of
his
own
accord
cecil
had
taken
his
arms
from
round
his
friend
neck
horrid
he
said
do
like
that
hard
thing
take
it
off
me
sara
sat
up
with
alacrity
me
but
miss
levering
undid
the
sapphire
necklace
herself
you
be
very
careful
sara
i
let
you
hold
it
it
was
as
if
she
well
knew
the
deft
little
hands
she
had
delivered
the
ornament
to
and
knew
equally
well
that
in
her
present
mood
absorption
in
the
beauty
of
it
would
keep
the
still
that
better
cecil
replaced
his
arms
firmly
where
the
necklace
had
been
miss
levering
pulled
up
her
long
cloak
from
the
bottom
of
the
bed
and
wrapped
the
little
boy
in
the
warm
lining
the
comfort
of
the
arrangement
was
so
great
and
it
implied
so
little
necessity
for
on
that
cecil
loosed
his
arms
and
lay
curled
up
against
his
friend
she
held
him
close
adapting
her
lithe
slimness
to
the
easy
supporting
and
enfolding
of
the
childish
figure
the
little
girl
was
absorbed
in
the
necklace
after
her
strenuous
hour
the
boy
content
for
a
moment
having
gained
his
point
just
to
lie
at
his
ease
the
woman
rested
her
cheek
on
his
ruffled
hair
and
looked
straight
before
her
as
she
sat
there
holding
him
something
came
into
her
face
guiltless
though
it
was
of
any
traceable
change
without
the
verifiable
movement
of
a
muscle
something
none
the
less
that
would
have
minded
the
beholder
uneasily
to
search
the
eyes
for
tears
and
finding
no
tears
there
to
feel
no
greater
sense
of
reassurance
so
motionless
she
sat
that
presently
the
child
turned
up
his
rosy
face
and
seeing
the
brooding
look
it
was
plain
he
had
the
sense
of
being
somehow
left
behind
he
put
up
his
hand
to
her
cheek
and
rubbed
it
softly
with
his
own
do
like
you
like
that
tell
me
about
what
said
the
lady
i
do
know
then
with
a
sudden
inspiration
ronald
says
you
like
the
sphinx
who
are
they
are
who
the
sfinks
have
they
got
a
boy
is
the
little
sfink
as
old
as
me
oh
you
only
laugh
just
like
uncle
ronald
he
asked
us
why
we
liked
you
and
we
told
him
never
told
me
did
we
well
it
because
you
are
beady
we
hate
all
beady
ladies
do
we
sara
but
it
my
turn
however
she
said
it
as
she
stopped
drawing
the
shining
jewels
lightly
through
her
slim
fingers
and
began
gently
to
swing
the
back
and
forth
like
a
pendulum
that
glanced
bewitchingly
in
the
light
miss
levering
knew
that
the
next
phase
would
be
to
try
it
on
but
for
the
moment
sara
had
still
half
an
ear
for
general
conversation
hate
them
to
have
hard
things
on
their
shoulders
cecil
explained
their
shoulders
miss
levering
asked
just
in
the
way
of
our
heads
on
their
dresses
explained
the
little
girl
stuff
that
scratches
when
they
hold
you
tight
cecil
cuddled
his
impudent
round
face
luxuriously
on
the
soft
shoulder
of
the
visitor
and
laughed
up
in
her
face
are
very
beady
said
sara
as
she
tried
the
effect
of
the
glitter
against
her
are
worse
amended
cecil
beady
and
too
bewgly
it
what
my
grandmother
called
them
when
i
pulled
some
of
them
off
not
proper
bugles
you
know
what
you
too
too
too
make
music
with
when
you
fighting
the
enemy
my
grandmother
thinks
bugles
are
little
shiny
black
things
only
about
that
long
he
measured
less
than
an
inch
on
his
minute
forefinger
long
holes
through
so
they
can
sew
them
on
their
clothes
their
caps
too
said
sara
they
usurally
white
when
they
on
caps
your
mother
coming
now
what
will
she
say
to
you
cecil
they
turned
their
eyes
to
the
door
strangely
unwelcoming
for
laura
tunbridge
children
and
their
young
faces
betrayed
no
surprise
when
the
very
different
figure
of
nurse
dampney
emerged
from
behind
the
tall
chintz
screen
that
protected
the
cots
from
any
draught
through
the
opening
door
cecil
with
an
action
of
settled
despair
turned
from
the
spectacle
and
buried
his
face
for
one
last
moment
of
comfort
in
vida
levering
shoulder
while
sara
with
a
baleful
glance
muttered
knew
it
was
that
old
interfiddler
master
cecil
nurse
miss
levering
carried
him
back
to
his
cot
tunbridge
has
sent
up
miss
to
know
if
you
come
waiting
dinner
really
is
it
a
quarter
past
already
like
twenty
minutes
miss
the
lady
caught
up
her
necklace
cut
short
her
and
fled
downstairs
clasping
the
shining
thing
round
her
neck
as
she
went
a
swaying
figure
in
soft
flying
draperies
and
gleaming
upraised
arms
she
entered
the
with
a
quiet
deliberation
greater
even
than
common
it
was
the
effect
that
haste
and
contrition
frequently
wrought
in
her
one
of
the
things
that
made
folk
call
her
even
trifle
supercilious
but
when
other
young
women
recognizing
some
not
easily
definable
charm
in
this
into
london
life
tried
to
copy
the
effect
alluded
to
it
was
found
to
be
less
imitable
than
it
looked
chapter
ii
there
were
already
a
dozen
or
so
persons
in
the
yet
the
moment
vida
levering
entered
she
knew
from
the
questing
glance
freddy
sent
past
her
children
visitor
that
even
now
the
party
was
not
complete
other
eyes
turned
that
way
as
the
servant
announced
levering
it
is
seldom
that
in
this
particular
stratum
of
london
life
anything
so
uncontrolled
and
uncontrollable
as
a
is
permitted
to
chequer
the
even
distribution
of
subdued
good
humour
that
reigns
so
modestly
in
the
of
the
tunbridge
world
if
any
one
is
so
as
to
bring
to
these
gatherings
anything
resembling
a
sensation
even
if
it
is
of
the
less
challengeable
sort
of
striking
personal
beauty
the
general
aim
of
the
company
is
to
pretend
either
that
they
see
nothing
unusual
in
the
conjunction
or
that
they
for
their
part
are
impervious
to
such
impacts
vida
levering
beauty
was
not
strictly
of
the
type
if
it
did
as
could
not
be
denied
arrest
the
eye
its
refusal
to
let
attention
go
was
mitigated
by
something
in
the
quietness
the
disarming
softness
with
which
the
hold
was
maintained
men
making
her
acquaintance
frequently
went
through
four
distinct
phases
in
their
feeling
about
her
the
first
was
the
common
natural
one
the
instant
stirring
of
the
pulses
that
beauty
of
any
sort
produces
in
persons
having
the
eye
that
sees
the
second
stage
was
a
rousing
of
the
instinct
to
be
guard
which
feminine
beauty
not
infrequently
breeds
in
the
breasts
of
men
not
on
guard
so
much
against
the
thing
itself
or
even
against
ready
submission
to
it
but
against
allowing
onlookers
to
be
witness
of
such
submission
even
the
very
young
man
knows
either
by
experience
or
hearsay
that
women
have
concentrated
upon
their
faculty
for
turning
this
particular
weapon
to
account
all
the
skill
they
would
have
divided
among
other
resources
had
there
been
others
yet
the
charm
is
something
too
delicious
even
to
desire
to
escape
from
the
impulse
centres
in
a
determination
to
untouched
immune
the
third
stage
in
this
declension
from
pleasure
through
caution
to
reassurance
is
induced
by
something
so
gentle
so
unemphatic
in
the
vida
levering
aspect
so
much
what
the
man
thinks
that
even
the
wariest
male
is
reassured
he
comes
to
be
almost
as
easy
before
this
particular
type
of
allurement
as
he
would
be
with
the
frankly
plain
sort
only
there
is
all
about
him
the
exquisite
aroma
of
a
subtle
charm
which
he
may
almost
persuade
himself
that
he
alone
perceives
since
this
softly
gracious
creature
seems
so
little
to
insist
upon
it
seems
indeed
to
be
herself
unaware
of
its
presence
whereupon
the
man
conceives
a
new
idea
of
his
own
perspicacity
in
detecting
a
thing
at
once
so
agreeable
and
so
little
advertised
he
may
with
a
woman
of
this
kind
go
long
upon
the
third
may
indeed
never
know
it
was
she
who
gently
him
still
unenlightened
and
left
him
but
cherishing
to
the
end
of
time
the
soothing
conviction
that
he
an
if
he
would
to
the
more
robust
order
of
man
will
come
a
day
of
awakening
when
he
rubs
his
eyes
and
retreats
hurriedly
with
a
sense
of
good
faith
injured
nay
of
hopes
positively
betrayed
if
she
were
sort
why
not
hang
out
some
signal
it
playing
fair
and
so
without
anything
so
crude
as
a
sensation
but
with
a
retinue
of
covert
looks
following
in
her
train
she
made
her
way
to
the
young
hostess
and
was
there
joined
by
two
men
and
a
woman
who
plainly
had
been
a
beauty
and
though
to
fat
as
the
vulgar
say
had
yet
kept
her
complexion
with
an
air
of
genial
authority
the
lady
john
ulland
proceeded
to
appropriate
the
in
the
midst
of
a
general
hum
of
conversation
whose
key
to
the
sensitive
ear
had
become
a
little
heightened
since
the
last
arrival
the
women
grew
more
insistently
vivacious
in
proportion
as
the
men
minds
seemed
to
wander
from
matters
they
had
discussed
contentedly
enough
before
freddy
tunbridge
was
a
very
popular
person
it
was
agreed
that
nobody
willingly
missed
one
of
her
parties
there
were
those
who
said
this
was
not
so
much
because
of
her
and
freddy
though
they
were
eminently
likeable
people
not
merely
because
you
met
there
and
not
even
because
of
the
excellence
of
their
dinners
notoriously
this
last
fact
fails
to
appeal
very
powerfully
to
the
majority
of
women
and
it
is
they
not
men
who
make
the
social
reputation
of
the
hostess
there
was
in
this
particular
case
a
theory
held
even
by
those
who
did
not
care
especially
about
freddy
that
hers
was
an
above
all
perhaps
a
house
people
had
a
pleasant
consciousness
of
looking
uncommon
well
in
her
pretty
others
said
it
was
the
room
it
was
the
lighting
which
certainly
was
most
discerningly
done
not
dim
and
yet
so
far
from
glaring
that
quite
plain
people
enjoyed
there
a
brief
unwonted
hour
of
good
looks
only
a
limited
amount
of
electricity
was
used
and
that
little
was
carefully
masked
and
modulated
while
the
two
great
chandeliers
each
of
them
held
aloft
a
very
forest
of
wax
candles
it
was
known
too
that
the
spell
was
in
no
danger
of
being
rudely
broken
the
same
tender
but
festive
radiance
would
bathe
the
hospitable
board
of
the
great
oak
below
and
why
were
they
not
processing
thither
it
my
sister
who
is
late
miss
levering
asked
turning
her
slim
neck
in
that
deliberate
way
of
hers
to
look
about
the
room
your
sister
is
over
there
talking
to
oh
a
freddy
having
looked
round
to
refresh
her
memory
was
fain
to
slur
over
the
fact
that
was
in
the
corner
by
the
pierced
screen
not
talking
to
any
one
but
on
the
contrary
staring
gloomy
sibylline
at
a
leaflet
advertising
a
charity
concert
a
document
conspicuously
left
by
freddy
on
a
little
table
on
her
way
to
rescue
from
her
desert
island
of
utter
loneliness
freddy
saw
sir
william
haycroft
the
cabinet
minister
rather
pointedly
making
his
escape
from
a
tall
handsome
woman
wearing
and
hair
dressed
commandingly
without
a
qualm
freddy
abandoned
to
prolonged
exile
in
order
to
soothe
the
ruffled
minister
think
she
said
pausing
in
front
of
the
great
man
and
delicately
offering
him
an
opportunity
to
make
any
predilection
known
think
you
know
every
one
here
haycroft
muttered
in
his
beard
but
his
eyes
had
lit
upon
the
new
face
that
he
said
but
his
tone
added
that
it
matters
do
know
her
well
that
a
proof
of
how
you
neglected
your
friends
since
the
new
government
came
in
but
you
really
mean
it
that
nobody
has
introduced
you
to
miss
levering
yet
what
freddy
thinking
about
replied
a
voice
at
her
elbow
with
characteristic
laconism
and
freddy
tunbridge
pulled
out
his
watch
give
them
five
minutes
more
said
his
wife
indulgently
not
a
daughter
of
old
sir
hervey
pursued
the
other
man
his
eyes
still
on
the
young
woman
talking
to
lady
john
and
the
foreign
ambassador
go
on
said
freddy
with
as
cloudless
a
brow
as
though
she
had
no
need
to
manufacture
conversation
while
the
dinner
was
being
kept
waiting
on
they
do
it
what
demanded
the
great
man
suspiciously
why
have
they
seen
her
before
comes
next
then
the
next
time
you
and
i
meet
in
the
country
or
find
ourselves
alone
in
a
crush
you
be
saying
what
her
story
why
has
a
woman
like
that
married
they
all
do
you
do
believe
me
just
wait
freddy
shall
take
you
over
and
was
freddy
beaming
at
the
prospective
success
of
her
new
friend
or
was
her
vanity
flattered
by
reflecting
upon
her
own
perspicacity
unavoidable
as
it
was
in
a
way
that
graham
townley
should
be
taken
down
to
dinner
by
the
new
minister
nevertheless
the
antidote
had
been
cleverly
provided
for
dear
why
i
thought
he
was
oh
there
he
is
seeing
her
hungry
husband
safely
anchored
in
front
of
the
iris
gown
instantly
she
abandoned
the
idea
of
disturbing
him
all
she
said
turning
again
to
haycroft
who
had
stood
the
image
of
stolid
unimpressionableness
all
freddy
right
since
she
going
to
sit
beside
you
at
dinner
it
a
good
reason
for
not
making
you
known
to
each
other
before
or
perhaps
you
never
experience
that
awful
feeling
of
being
talked
out
by
the
time
you
go
down
and
not
having
a
single
thing
left
she
saw
that
the
great
man
was
not
going
to
vouchsafe
any
contribution
to
her
small
attempt
to
keep
the
ball
rolling
so
without
giving
him
the
chance
to
mark
her
failure
by
a
silence
however
brief
she
chattered
on
with
vida
you
not
likely
to
find
yourself
in
that
predicament
is
he
ronald
with
the
instinct
of
the
female
to
draw
into
her
circle
any
odd
man
hovering
about
on
the
periphery
freddy
appealed
to
her
lord
borrodaile
turned
in
her
direction
his
long
sallow
face
a
face
that
would
have
been
saturnine
but
for
its
touch
of
whimsicality
and
a
singularly
charming
smile
will
bear
me
out
freddy
went
on
quite
as
though
breaking
off
a
heated
argument
lord
borrodaile
sauntered
up
and
offered
a
long
thin
hand
to
haycroft
fella
who
bringing
the
country
to
the
dogs
as
freddy
knew
right
well
was
his
conviction
steering
wide
of
politics
gather
he
said
with
his
air
of
amiable
boredom
you
were
discussing
what
used
in
the
days
of
my
youth
to
be
called
a
lady
conversational
powers
forbid
you
to
apply
such
deadly
phrases
to
my
friend
freddy
denounced
him
friend
too
prove
my
title
to
the
distinction
by
proclaiming
that
she
has
the
subtlest
art
a
woman
can
possess
more
like
it
said
freddy
gaily
is
the
subtlest
art
art
of
being
silent
without
being
dull
if
there
was
any
sting
in
this
for
the
lady
nearest
him
she
gave
no
sign
of
making
the
personal
application
i
expressly
forbid
your
encouraging
vida
in
silence
most
men
like
to
be
amused
you
know
perfectly
well
do
yes
he
said
languidly
catching
haycroft
eye
and
almost
making
terms
with
him
upon
a
common
ground
of
masculine
understanding
yes
it
is
well
known
what
children
we
are
pleased
with
a
rattle
then
as
if
fearing
he
might
be
going
too
far
he
smiled
that
disarming
smile
of
his
and
said
know
now
why
you
are
called
a
good
hostess
asked
the
lady
a
little
anxiously
for
his
compliments
were
not
always
soothing
a
motion
towards
the
one
to
look
at
you
would
suppose
that
your
spirit
was
racked
between
the
clock
and
the
door
she
said
relieved
they
come
in
five
minutes
or
so
see
the
dinner
wo
be
a
penny
the
worse
jules
is
such
a
wizard
all
i
mind
is
seeing
freddy
fussed
she
turned
with
an
engaging
smile
to
her
minister
again
has
the
most
angelic
temper
except
when
hungry
bless
him
now
that
he
talking
to
vida
levering
forget
whether
it
before
dinner
or
after
what
said
a
brisk
old
gentleman
with
a
face
like
a
peculiarly
wicked
monkey
he
abandoned
townley
with
enthusiasm
in
order
to
say
to
his
hostess
me
the
witch
who
can
work
that
spell
dear
i
afraid
said
freddy
prettily
dreadfully
afraid
that
means
you
starving
does
it
make
you
morose
as
it
does
freddy
she
asked
with
an
air
of
comic
terror
we
wo
wait
she
tossed
out
one
arm
with
a
funny
little
movement
that
sent
her
thin
draperies
floating
as
though
towards
the
bell
dear
lady
the
old
gentleman
arrested
her
hunger
it
is
true
but
only
for
knowledge
in
a
silent
but
rather
horrible
laugh
he
wrinkled
up
his
aged
nose
which
was
quite
enough
wrinkled
and
sufficiently
already
the
witch
we
were
talking
about
a
member
of
your
family
she
turned
again
to
the
new
minister
sir
oh
how
absurd
i
was
going
to
introduce
two
pillars
of
the
state
to
one
another
i
be
anxious
about
those
late
people
after
all
a
matter
of
fact
you
and
i
never
have
met
said
haycroft
cordially
taking
old
hand
you
permanent
officials
we
ephemerÃ¦
the
sport
of
parties
all
right
freddy
head
poised
an
instant
on
one
side
seemed
to
say
is
it
who
is
late
demanded
graham
townley
whose
entrance
into
the
conversation
produced
the
effect
of
the
sudden
opening
of
window
and
door
on
a
windy
day
people
shrink
a
little
in
the
draught
and
all
light
frivolous
things
are
blown
out
of
the
way
english
people
stand
this
sort
of
thing
very
much
as
they
stand
the
actual
draughts
in
their
cold
houses
they
feel
it
to
be
good
for
them
on
the
whole
graham
townley
was
acknowledged
to
be
a
person
of
much
character
though
her
interest
in
public
affairs
was
bounded
only
by
the
limits
of
the
empire
she
had
found
time
to
reform
the
administration
of
a
great
london
hospital
also
she
was
related
to
a
great
many
people
in
the
ultra
smart
set
she
of
course
had
no
but
in
the
older
society
it
was
held
meet
that
these
things
be
so
that
when
she
put
her
question
not
only
was
she
not
ignored
but
each
one
felt
it
a
serious
thing
for
anybody
to
be
so
late
that
graham
townley
instead
of
some
one
with
now
should
you
say
is
the
extent
of
the
influence
in
egypt
should
be
reduced
to
asking
are
we
waiting
for
certain
to
be
a
man
said
lady
john
ulland
as
calmly
convinced
as
one
who
states
a
natural
law
asked
her
niece
the
charming
girl
in
rose
colour
woman
would
dare
to
come
in
so
late
as
this
she
have
turned
back
and
telephoned
that
the
horses
had
run
away
with
her
or
something
of
the
sort
farnborough
wo
turn
back
farnborough
the
culprit
said
a
smartly
dressed
woman
with
a
nervous
rather
angry
air
though
the
ropes
of
fine
pearls
she
wore
might
some
would
think
have
soothed
the
most
savage
breast
dick
and
captain
beeching
said
freddy
i
shall
give
them
just
two
minutes
more
ellen
it
could
be
a
woman
remarked
the
girl
in
pink
as
one
struck
with
such
perspicacity
i
would
ask
them
again
to
house
said
the
discontented
person
with
the
pearls
she
would
lady
john
said
aside
to
borrodaile
has
a
daughter
and
so
have
most
of
the
london
hostesses
and
the
young
villains
know
it
yes
sometimes
they
never
turn
up
at
all
said
the
pink
niece
accepting
ejaculated
lady
whyteleafe
of
the
pearls
yes
sometimes
they
do
even
answer
never
heard
of
such
impudence
have
twice
this
year
said
graham
townley
with
that
effect
of
breaking
by
main
force
into
a
conversation
instead
of
being
drawn
into
it
in
this
last
year
i
sat
with
an
empty
place
on
one
side
of
me
at
a
on
each
occasion
it
was
a
young
member
of
parliament
who
never
turned
up
and
never
sent
an
apology
same
man
both
times
asked
lord
borrodaile
different
houses
but
the
same
man
whispered
borrodaile
in
lady
john
ear
farnborough
has
been
complaining
that
since
he
smashed
his
motor
all
existence
has
become
disorganized
i
always
feel
the
hostess
addressed
herself
to
the
minister
and
the
pearls
you
that
one
ought
to
stretch
a
point
for
people
who
have
to
go
about
in
cabs
as
haycroft
began
a
disquisition
on
the
changes
in
social
life
initiated
by
the
use
of
the
freddy
floated
away
borrodaile
looking
after
her
remarked
humane
of
my
to
think
of
making
allowances
most
of
us
gratify
the
dormant
cruelty
in
human
nature
by
keeping
an
eagle
eye
on
the
wretched
late
ones
when
at
last
they
slink
in
do
you
know
he
turned
to
lady
john
look
of
interest
every
one
wants
to
see
whether
these
particular
culprits
wear
their
rue
with
a
difference
whether
borrodaile
went
on
like
the
majority
they
merely
look
abject
and
flustered
and
whisper
agitated
lies
personally
i
have
known
it
to
be
the
most
interesting
moment
of
the
evening
what
brought
plight
forcibly
home
to
freddy
was
seeing
vida
leave
her
own
animated
group
to
join
her
sister
freddy
made
her
way
across
the
room
stopping
a
moment
to
say
to
freddy
as
she
passed
go
and
make
conversation
to
lady
whyteleafe
is
lady
whyteleafe
drawled
freddy
you
forget
her
what
i
to
do
with
you
she
the
woman
with
the
pearls
that
yes
darling
that
the
one
she
only
looking
like
that
because
you
are
talking
to
her
and
freddy
overtook
vida
just
as
she
reached
the
desert
island
where
stood
looking
seaward
for
a
sail
a
few
moments
later
after
ringing
for
dinner
freddy
paused
an
instant
taking
in
the
fact
that
lady
whyteleafe
had
been
made
as
happy
by
tunbridge
attentions
as
his
wife
had
prophesied
no
the
angry
woman
with
the
pearls
so
far
from
being
intent
upon
remarks
was
levelling
at
freddy
the
critical
eye
that
says
i
shall
see
if
i
can
determine
just
how
miserably
conscious
you
are
that
dinner
unpardonably
late
everybody
starving
and
since
you
only
just
rung
that
you
have
at
least
eight
minutes
still
to
fill
up
before
you
hear
that
you
are
served
lady
whyteleafe
leaned
against
the
back
of
the
little
periwinkle
damask
sofa
and
waited
to
see
freddy
carry
off
these
last
minutes
of
suspense
by
an
affectation
of
great
good
spirits
but
the
lady
under
the
social
microscope
knew
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
she
could
turn
more
than
one
mishap
to
account
freddy
oh
lady
whyteleafe
i
just
gone
and
said
the
most
awful
dreadful
appalling
thing
oh
i
should
like
to
creep
under
the
sofa
and
die
up
demanded
freddy
with
an
air
of
relief
at
being
reinforced
been
talking
to
vida
levering
and
that
funereal
sister
of
hers
mrs
said
lady
whyteleafe
obviously
disappointed
a
is
she
yes
oh
i
wish
she
never
stepped
over
my
threshold
said
freddy
sticking
in
his
eyeglass
freddy
do
look
at
her
oh
i
wish
i
were
dead
you
been
doing
she
looks
as
if
she
wished
were
dead
nothing
she
always
looks
like
that
lady
whyteleafe
assured
the
pair
and
she
makes
it
a
great
favour
to
come
i
seldom
go
into
society
she
writes
in
her
stiff
little
notes
and
you
reminded
that
way
without
her
actually
setting
it
down
that
she
devotes
herself
to
good
works
she
does
know
what
else
to
do
with
all
that
money
said
the
lady
of
the
pearls
has
got
a
penny
piece
is
it
all
his
i
thought
the
leverings
were
rather
well
off
but
the
money
came
through
the
second
wife
vida
mother
oh
i
hate
that
woman
freddy
laughed
ruefully
i
sure
her
husband
is
a
great
deal
too
good
for
her
but
how
i
have
done
it
have
told
us
yet
asked
me
who
was
late
and
i
said
dick
farnborough
and
that
i
hoped
he
had
forgotten
for
i
had
hermione
heriot
here
on
purpose
to
meet
him
and
i
told
vida
about
the
heriots
trying
to
marry
hermione
to
that
old
colonel
redding
ca
they
bring
it
off
said
lady
whyteleafe
been
afraid
they
would
it
so
dreadful
i
said
to
see
a
fresh
young
girl
tied
to
a
old
man
remarked
lady
whyteleafe
genuinely
shocked
you
said
that
to
freddy
nodded
with
melancholy
significance
when
vida
said
it
seems
to
do
well
enough
sometimes
i
never
never
remembered
the
story
and
i
went
on
about
it
being
a
miracle
when
it
turned
out
even
tolerably
and
oh
heaven
forgive
me
i
grew
eloquent
your
passion
for
making
speeches
said
freddy
at
which
accountably
to
lady
whyteleafe
freddy
blushed
and
stumbled
in
this
particular
know
i
know
she
said
carrying
it
off
with
an
air
of
comic
contrition
even
said
there
a
modesty
in
nature
that
it
wise
to
overstep
i
forgotten
some
people
think
comes
under
that
head
it
been
realized
i
said
yes
rushing
on
my
doom
it
been
realized
up
to
now
only
in
the
usual
way
discouraging
boys
from
marrying
women
old
enough
to
be
their
mothers
but
dear
blundering
fatuous
man
she
smiled
into
her
husband
pleasantly
mocking
face
thinks
i
said
at
age
he
a
fit
mate
for
a
fresh
young
creature
in
her
teens
if
they
only
knew
the
dreadful
old
ogres
yes
i
said
that
i
piled
it
on
oh
i
stuck
at
nothing
the
men
think
an
ugly
old
woman
monopolizes
all
the
opportunities
humanity
offers
for
repulsiveness
but
there
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
earth
as
hideous
i
said
as
an
ugly
old
man
it
stand
to
reason
he
bound
to
go
greater
lengths
than
any
woman
can
aspire
to
there
more
of
him
to
ugly
is
there
i
appealed
to
them
everything
about
him
is
bigger
coarser
he
much
less
human
says
i
and
more
like
a
dreadful
old
monkey
i
raised
my
wretched
eyes
and
there
not
three
feet
away
was
the
aged
husband
of
the
woman
ogling
hermione
heriot
oh
let
me
die
freddy
leaned
against
the
sofa
for
a
moment
and
half
closed
her
pretty
eyes
the
next
instant
she
was
running
gaily
across
the
room
to
welcome
richard
farnborough
and
captain
beeching
always
know
said
lord
borrodaile
glancing
over
the
banisters
as
he
and
vida
went
down
always
know
the
kind
of
party
it
going
to
be
when
i
see
certain
people
do
you
know
who
you
mean
vida
whispered
back
her
eyes
on
graham
townley
aggressively
hair
towering
over
the
bald
pate
of
the
minister
as
side
by
side
they
disappeared
through
the
door
laura
have
her
she
immensely
intelligent
they
he
sighed
why
i
wonder
laughed
vida
are
rather
frivolous
afraid
tell
the
truth
i
wondered
too
i
even
sounded
my
said
it
was
her
day
of
reckoning
i
never
ask
the
woman
she
said
except
to
a
scratch
party
like
this
scratch
party
with
you
and
me
here
we
are
the
leaven
we
make
the
compound
possible
i
do
think
she
ought
to
call
it
scratch
when
she
got
an
ambassador
and
a
cabinet
minister
the
party
to
ask
a
scratch
cabinet
minister
to
he
insisted
stopping
between
the
two
cards
inscribed
respectively
with
their
names
for
the
ambassador
he
an
old
friend
of
ours
knows
his
london
well
knows
we
are
the
most
tolerant
society
on
the
face
of
the
earth
in
spite
of
her
companion
affectation
of
a
smiling
quarrelsomeness
vida
unfolded
her
with
the
air
of
one
looking
forward
to
her
with
the
man
who
had
brought
her
down
but
lord
borrodaile
was
a
person
most
women
liked
talking
to
and
hardly
had
she
begun
to
relish
that
combination
in
the
man
of
careless
pleasantry
and
pungent
criticism
when
vida
caught
an
agonized
glance
from
her
hostess
which
said
plainly
the
man
on
your
right
and
lo
miss
levering
became
aware
that
already
before
the
poor
jaded
politician
had
swallowed
his
soup
townley
had
fallen
to
catechising
him
about
the
new
bill
a
theme
talked
threadbare
by
newspaperdom
and
all
political
england
but
townley
albeit
not
exactly
old
was
one
of
those
women
who
take
what
used
to
be
called
intelligent
interest
in
politics
you
may
pick
her
out
in
any
from
the
fact
that
politicians
shun
her
like
the
plague
rich
childless
lonely
with
more
wits
than
occupation
practically
shelved
at
a
time
when
her
intellectual
life
is
most
alert
the
townleys
of
the
world
do
it
must
be
admitted
labour
under
the
delusion
that
men
fighting
the
battle
of
public
life
go
out
to
dine
for
the
express
purpose
of
telling
the
intelligent
female
about
it
she
is
a
staunch
believer
not
so
much
in
women
influence
as
in
woman
and
there
is
no
doubt
in
her
mind
which
woman
if
among
her
smart
relations
who
ask
her
to
their
houses
and
go
to
hers
from
that
sentiment
of
the
solidarity
of
the
family
so
powerful
in
english
life
if
amongst
these
she
succeeds
from
time
to
time
in
inducing
two
or
three
public
officials
or
even
private
members
to
prove
how
good
a
cook
she
keeps
she
thinks
she
is
exercising
an
influence
on
the
politics
of
her
time
her
form
of
conversation
consists
in
plying
her
victim
with
questions
not
here
one
there
one
to
keep
the
ball
rolling
but
a
steady
and
pitiless
fire
of
you
think
and
do
you
obedient
to
her
hostess
wireless
telegram
miss
levering
bent
her
head
and
said
to
townley
neighbour
know
i
ought
not
to
talk
to
you
till
after
the
do
said
sir
william
with
a
sudden
glint
in
his
little
eyes
and
then
with
a
air
of
caution
he
began
you
make
conditions
said
miss
levering
laughing
one
promise
not
he
lowered
his
voice
not
to
say
bill
wo
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
william
he
laughed
as
obligingly
as
though
the
jest
had
been
a
good
one
a
little
ashamed
its
maker
hastened
to
leave
it
behind
nothing
i
should
quite
so
much
hate
talking
about
as
politics
saving
your
presence
was
thinking
of
something
more
important
even
her
rallying
tone
did
not
wholly
reassure
the
poor
man
important
he
repeated
i
long
to
know
and
i
long
to
be
forgiven
for
asking
what
order
that
is
you
are
wearing
and
what
you
did
to
get
it
haycroft
breathed
freely
he
talked
for
the
next
ten
minutes
about
the
bauble
making
a
humorous
translation
of
its
latin
and
describing
in
the
same
vein
the
service
to
a
foreign
state
that
had
won
him
the
recognition
he
would
have
worn
the
thing
except
out
of
compliment
to
the
ambassador
from
the
power
in
question
they
were
going
on
together
to
the
reception
at
the
foreign
office
as
to
the
order
haycroft
seemed
to
feel
he
owed
it
to
himself
to
smile
at
all
such
toys
but
he
did
not
disdain
to
amuse
the
pretty
lady
with
the
one
in
question
any
more
than
being
humane
and
even
genial
sitting
before
freddy
menu
he
would
have
refused
to
show
the
whirring
wheels
of
his
watch
to
a
nice
child
the
two
got
on
so
well
that
the
anxious
look
quite
faded
out
of
freddy
face
and
she
devoted
herself
gaily
to
the
distinguished
foreigner
at
her
side
but
haycroft
at
a
party
was
like
so
many
englishmen
as
the
lilies
of
the
field
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
the
man
vida
had
rescued
from
graham
townley
was
when
in
the
society
of
women
so
accustomed
to
seeing
them
take
on
themselves
the
onus
of
entertainment
was
himself
so
unused
to
being
at
the
smallest
trouble
that
when
the
was
exhausted
had
vida
not
invented
another
topic
there
would
have
been
an
absolute
cessation
of
all
converse
till
graham
townley
had
again
caught
him
up
like
a
big
reluctant
fish
on
the
hook
of
interrogation
at
a
reproachful
aside
from
lord
borrodaile
miss
levering
broke
off
in
the
middle
of
her
second
subject
to
substitute
i
am
monopolizing
you
disgracefully
and
she
half
turned
away
from
the
eminent
politician
into
whose
slightly
flushed
face
and
humid
eyes
had
come
something
like
animation
at
all
not
at
all
go
on
i
gone
far
enough
do
you
realize
that
we
left
orders
and
honours
half
an
hour
ago
and
ever
since
we
been
talking
scandal
life
he
amended
pursuit
worthy
of
two
philosophers
did
it
said
the
lady
with
an
air
of
discontent
with
herself
know
why
i
did
it
he
met
her
eye
and
the
faint
motion
that
indicated
the
woman
on
his
other
side
person
he
whispered
goes
out
to
dine
as
a
soldier
goes
into
action
for
the
next
few
minutes
they
made
common
cause
in
heaping
ridicule
on
political
woman
after
all
vida
pulled
herself
up
may
be
only
a
case
of
sour
grapes
on
my
part
i
afraid
conversation
is
inclined
to
be
frivolous
he
turned
and
gave
her
her
reward
the
feeling
smile
that
says
god
but
strangely
it
did
not
reflect
itself
in
the
woman
face
something
quite
different
there
lurking
under
the
soft
gaiety
was
it
consciousness
of
this
being
the
second
time
during
the
evening
that
she
had
employed
the
too
common
vaunt
of
the
woman
of
that
particular
world
did
some
ironic
echo
reach
her
of
that
same
boast
often
as
mirthless
and
as
pitiful
as
the
painted
smile
on
the
cruder
face
the
afraid
i
rather
frivolous
of
the
woman
whose
frivolity
invaluable
asset
is
beginning
to
show
wear
to
return
to
our
mutton
he
said
and
as
his
companion
seemed
suddenly
to
be
overtaken
by
some
unaccountable
qualm
a
desert
life
would
be
he
added
encouragingly
we
could
talk
to
the
discreet
about
the
indiscreet
wonder
if
there
would
be
still
more
oases
in
the
desert
she
said
idly
there
were
a
new
law
made
he
glanced
at
her
with
veiled
apprehension
in
the
pause
being
so
liberal
she
went
on
with
faint
mockery
the
very
one
to
introduce
the
measure
he
shrank
visibly
and
seemed
about
to
remind
her
of
her
pledge
shall
ordain
she
went
on
those
who
have
found
satisfactory
husbands
or
wives
are
to
rest
content
with
their
good
fortune
and
not
be
so
greedy
as
to
insist
on
having
the
children
too
his
gravity
relaxed
on
the
other
hand
all
the
lonely
women
the
widows
and
spinsters
who
have
got
anything
else
shall
have
the
children
wo
go
so
far
as
that
he
laughed
boundlessly
relieved
that
the
conversation
was
not
taking
the
strenuous
turn
he
for
a
moment
feared
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
support
a
measure
that
shall
make
an
allowance
of
child
to
every
single
woman
the
proper
and
accepted
arrangement
no
questions
asked
and
no
disgrace
she
echoed
smiling
the
contrary
it
should
be
the
woman
title
to
honour
she
should
be
given
a
beautiful
order
like
yours
for
service
to
the
state
yes
but
what
then
would
we
talk
about
she
had
turned
away
definitely
this
time
said
borrodaile
a
little
mocking
is
it
do
know
she
answered
do
know
it
is
that
seizes
hold
of
me
after
i
been
chattering
like
this
for
an
hour
or
more
borrodaile
bent
his
head
and
glanced
past
vida
to
the
abandoned
minister
me
by
saying
a
slight
weariness
like
loathing
of
your
neighbours
i
hope
he
lost
the
low
myself
there
one
person
she
said
with
something
like
enthusiasm
person
that
i
respect
and
admire
he
glanced
about
the
board
with
an
air
of
lazy
interest
one
do
know
her
name
i
mean
the
woman
who
dares
to
sit
quite
silent
and
eat
her
dinner
without
looking
like
a
lost
soul
been
saying
you
could
do
that
she
shook
her
head
i
been
engaged
for
the
last
hour
in
proving
i
have
the
courage
it
just
come
over
me
she
said
her
eyes
in
their
turn
making
a
tour
of
the
table
and
coming
back
to
borrodaile
with
the
look
of
having
caught
up
a
topic
on
the
way
just
come
over
me
what
we
all
doing
we
all
doing
the
same
thing
the
men
are
doing
one
thing
and
all
the
women
another
his
idly
curious
look
travelled
up
and
down
and
returned
to
her
unenlightened
the
women
she
said
trying
with
might
and
main
to
amuse
the
men
and
all
the
men
are
more
or
less
permitting
the
women
to
succeed
sorry
he
said
laughing
hear
of
your
being
so
make
it
easy
and
yet
she
caught
the
gratitude
away
from
her
voice
suppose
i
should
have
said
something
like
that
even
if
i
been
talking
to
my
other
neighbour
borrodaile
look
went
again
from
one
couple
to
another
for
as
usual
in
england
the
talk
was
all
the
result
of
his
inspection
seemed
not
to
lend
itself
to
her
mood
ca
speak
for
others
but
for
myself
i
always
conscious
of
wanting
to
be
agreeable
when
i
with
you
i
sorry
he
was
speaking
in
the
usual
tone
sorry
if
i
succeed
so
already
admitted
that
with
you
succeed
to
admiration
but
you
only
try
because
it
easy
he
laughed
rather
like
talking
to
me
you
know
now
can
you
lay
your
hand
on
your
heart
deny
it
never
you
lay
your
hand
on
your
heart
and
say
you
tried
as
hard
to
entertain
your
other
neighbour
as
i
have
to
keep
mine
going
well
we
men
are
as
good
at
it
after
all
it
rather
the
woman
part
is
it
art
of
pleasing
i
suppose
it
is
but
it
rather
a
geisha
view
of
life
do
you
think
at
all
rightly
viewed
it
a
woman
privilege
her
natural
function
the
brutes
are
nobler
than
we
wondering
he
glanced
at
her
the
face
was
wholly
reassuring
but
he
said
with
a
faint
uneasiness
it
were
you
i
say
that
sounds
a
little
bitter
no
she
laughed
was
only
thinking
about
the
lion
mane
and
the
male
bird
crest
and
what
the
natural
history
bores
say
for
chapter
iii
the
darkness
and
the
quiet
of
vida
levering
bedroom
were
rudely
dispelled
at
a
punctual
eight
each
morning
by
the
entrance
of
a
gaunt
female
it
was
this
person
unvarying
custom
to
fling
back
the
heavy
curtains
as
though
it
gratified
some
strong
recurrent
need
in
her
to
hear
brass
rings
run
squealing
along
a
bar
as
if
she
counted
that
day
lost
which
was
not
well
begun
by
shooting
the
blinds
up
with
a
clatter
and
a
bang
the
harsh
ceremonial
served
as
a
sort
of
setting
of
the
pace
or
a
metaphorical
shaking
of
a
bony
fist
in
the
face
of
the
day
as
much
as
to
say
i
admit
you
here
you
have
to
toe
the
mark
it
might
be
taken
as
proof
of
sound
nerves
that
the
lady
in
the
bed
offered
no
remonstrance
at
being
jarred
awake
in
this
ungentle
fashion
fourteen
years
before
when
vida
levering
was
only
eighteen
she
had
tried
to
make
something
like
a
conventional
maid
out
of
the
faithful
northumbrian
rachel
wark
had
entered
lady
levering
service
just
before
vida
birth
and
had
helped
to
nurse
her
mistress
through
a
mortal
illness
ten
years
later
after
sir
hervey
levering
lost
his
wife
wark
became
in
time
housekeeper
and
general
factotum
to
the
family
this
arrangement
held
without
a
break
until
as
before
hinted
miss
vida
full
of
the
hopeful
idealism
of
early
youth
had
tried
and
ignominiously
failed
in
her
attempt
to
teach
the
woman
gentler
manners
for
wark
characteristic
retort
had
been
to
pack
her
box
and
go
to
spend
sixteen
months
among
her
kinsfolk
where
energy
was
accounted
a
virtue
and
smooth
ways
held
in
suspicion
at
the
end
of
that
time
seeming
to
judge
the
lesson
she
wished
to
impart
had
been
sufficiently
digested
wark
wrote
to
miss
vida
proposing
to
come
back
for
some
months
she
waited
for
the
answer
it
came
at
last
from
biarritz
where
it
appeared
the
young
lady
was
spending
the
winter
with
her
father
after
an
exchange
of
letters
wark
joined
them
there
in
the
twelve
years
since
her
return
to
the
family
she
had
by
degrees
adapted
herself
to
the
task
of
looking
after
her
young
lady
the
adaptation
was
not
all
on
one
side
many
of
vida
friends
wondered
that
she
could
put
up
with
a
lady
maid
who
could
do
so
few
of
the
things
commonly
expected
of
that
accomplished
class
do
want
dressmaking
going
on
in
the
house
contentedly
vida
told
off
her
maid
negative
qualifications
i
hate
having
anybody
do
my
hair
for
me
wark
packs
quite
beautifully
and
then
i
like
some
one
about
me
that
i
like
in
the
early
days
what
she
had
most
about
the
woman
was
that
wark
had
known
and
been
attached
to
lady
levering
there
was
no
one
else
with
whom
vida
could
talk
about
her
mother
by
the
time
death
overtook
sir
hervey
two
winters
ago
in
rome
wark
had
become
so
essential
a
part
of
vida
little
entourage
that
one
of
the
excuses
offered
by
that
lady
for
not
going
to
live
with
her
in
london
had
been
does
always
get
on
with
other
servants
for
several
years
miss
levering
friends
had
been
speaking
of
her
as
one
fallen
a
victim
to
that
passion
for
italy
that
makes
it
an
abiding
place
dearer
than
home
to
so
many
but
the
had
not
been
misled
either
by
that
theory
or
by
the
difficulty
as
to
pleasing
wark
with
the
queen
anne
gate
servants
not
that
vida
loves
italy
so
much
as
that
for
some
reason
she
does
love
england
at
all
nevertheless
after
some
months
had
persuaded
her
to
wark
and
try
us
the
experiment
now
over
a
year
old
seemed
to
have
turned
out
well
if
vida
really
did
not
love
her
native
land
she
seemed
to
enjoy
well
enough
what
she
called
smiling
martin
summer
of
her
success
in
london
society
she
turned
over
in
her
bed
on
this
particular
may
morning
stretching
out
her
long
figure
and
then
letting
it
sink
luxuriously
back
into
relaxed
quiescence
with
a
conscious
joy
in
prolonging
those
last
ten
minutes
when
sleep
is
slowly
softly
one
after
another
withdrawing
her
thousand
veils
vaguely
as
she
lay
there
with
face
half
buried
in
her
pillow
vaguely
she
was
aware
that
wark
was
making
even
more
noise
than
common
when
the
woman
had
bustled
in
and
bustled
out
several
times
and
deposited
the
shoes
with
a
she
reappeared
with
the
delicate
porcelain
tray
that
bore
the
early
tea
on
the
little
table
close
to
where
the
dark
head
lay
half
hidden
wark
set
the
fragile
burden
down
did
it
with
an
emphasis
that
made
cup
and
saucer
shiver
and
run
for
support
towards
the
pot
vida
opened
her
eyes
wark
you
know
nobody
on
earth
would
let
you
wake
them
in
the
morning
except
me
she
sat
up
and
pulled
the
pillow
higher
me
the
tray
here
she
said
sleepily
wark
obeyed
she
had
said
nothing
to
vida
reproof
she
stood
now
by
the
bedside
without
a
trace
of
either
contrition
or
resentment
in
the
wooden
face
that
seemed
in
recompense
for
never
having
been
young
to
be
able
successfully
to
defy
the
pencil
time
had
made
but
one
or
two
faint
ineffectual
scratches
there
as
one
who
tries
and
then
abandons
an
unpromising
surface
the
lack
of
record
in
the
face
lent
it
something
almost
cryptic
if
there
were
no
lines
about
the
eyes
neither
was
there
mark
of
grief
or
near
the
mouth
she
would
you
felt
defy
time
as
successfully
as
she
defied
lesser
foes
even
the
lank
hair
hardly
showed
the
streaks
of
that
offered
their
unemphatic
clue
to
age
the
sensitive
face
of
the
woman
in
the
bed
even
now
with
something
of
the
peace
of
sleep
still
shadowing
its
brilliancy
gave
by
contrast
an
impression
of
vividness
and
eager
sympathies
the
mistress
too
looked
younger
than
her
years
she
did
not
seem
to
wonder
at
the
dull
presence
that
seemed
to
be
held
there
behind
the
brass
bars
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
wark
sometimes
gave
herself
this
five
with
her
mistress
before
the
business
of
the
day
began
and
all
their
intercourse
was
swamped
in
clothes
meant
to
pin
a
paper
on
the
door
to
say
i
was
to
be
called
till
ten
said
the
lady
as
though
keeping
up
the
little
pretence
of
not
being
pleased
you
sleep
well
the
maid
managed
wholly
to
denude
the
question
of
its
usual
grace
of
solicitude
but
it
was
so
late
when
i
began
we
did
get
back
till
nearly
three
did
get
much
sleep
either
it
was
an
admission
from
wark
said
vida
lazily
sipping
her
tea
conscience
she
said
slowly
as
the
woman
raised
her
light
eyes
miss
levering
saw
to
her
astonishment
that
the
lids
were
red
wark
too
seemed
uncomfortably
aware
of
something
unusual
in
her
face
for
she
turned
it
away
and
busied
herself
in
smoothing
down
the
near
corner
of
the
bath
blanket
kept
awake
miss
levering
asked
i
suppose
i
better
tell
you
while
the
other
people
round
i
want
a
day
or
two
to
go
into
the
country
the
country
no
such
request
had
been
heard
for
a
round
dozen
of
years
got
some
business
to
see
to
home
in
northumberland
the
tone
seemed
so
little
to
promise
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
confidence
that
miss
levering
merely
said
very
well
when
do
you
want
to
go
could
go
if
she
stopped
and
looked
down
at
the
hem
of
her
long
white
apron
something
unwonted
in
the
wooden
face
prompted
miss
levering
to
say
do
you
want
to
do
in
the
country
see
about
a
place
that
been
offered
me
wark
post
of
housekeeper
that
what
i
really
am
you
know
miss
levering
looked
at
her
and
set
down
the
cup
without
opening
her
lips
if
the
speech
had
come
from
any
other
than
wark
it
would
have
been
easy
to
believe
it
merely
the
prelude
to
complaint
of
a
or
plea
for
a
rise
in
wages
but
if
wark
objected
to
a
her
own
view
of
the
matter
had
always
been
that
the
other
one
should
go
her
mistress
knew
quite
well
that
in
the
mouth
of
the
woman
standing
there
with
red
eyes
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
such
an
announcement
as
had
just
been
made
meant
more
and
the
consciousness
seemed
to
bring
with
it
a
sense
of
acute
discomfort
not
unmixed
with
anger
for
there
was
a
threat
of
something
worse
than
an
infliction
of
mere
inconvenience
it
was
a
species
of
desertion
it
was
almost
treachery
they
had
lived
together
all
the
younger
woman
life
except
for
those
two
years
that
followed
on
the
girl
attempt
to
make
a
conventional
servant
out
of
a
creature
who
could
be
that
but
who
had
it
in
her
to
be
more
they
had
been
too
long
together
for
wark
not
to
divine
something
through
all
the
lady
of
her
sense
of
being
abandoned
having
to
tell
you
that
that
kept
me
awake
the
wave
of
dull
colour
that
mounted
up
to
the
bushy
eyebrows
seemed
on
the
way
to
have
overflowed
into
her
eyes
they
grew
redder
than
before
and
slowly
they
filled
do
like
living
here
in
this
house
vida
caught
at
the
old
complication
got
used
to
it
the
woman
said
baldly
then
after
a
little
pause
during
which
she
made
a
barely
audible
rasping
to
clear
her
throat
do
like
leaving
you
miss
i
always
remember
how
that
time
before
the
only
time
i
was
ever
away
from
you
since
you
was
a
baby
how
different
i
found
you
when
i
came
back
wark
miss
it
seemed
like
you
turned
into
somebody
else
people
change
develope
in
those
years
just
before
twenty
like
you
did
miss
you
gave
me
a
deal
of
trouble
when
you
was
little
but
it
nearly
broke
my
heart
to
come
back
and
find
you
so
quieted
down
and
a
flash
of
tears
glimmered
in
the
mistress
eyes
though
her
lips
were
smiling
course
the
maid
went
on
you
never
told
me
about
it
i
know
you
had
things
to
bear
while
i
was
away
or
else
you
would
have
gone
away
from
your
home
that
time
a
mere
child
and
tried
to
teach
for
a
living
absurd
of
me
but
whosever
fault
it
was
it
was
yours
miss
in
a
way
it
was
i
owed
it
to
your
mother
not
to
have
left
you
i
never
told
you
how
i
blamed
myself
when
i
heard
and
i
wonder
at
you
it
hard
when
your
mother
was
hardly
cold
to
see
your
father
now
that
enough
wark
you
know
we
never
speak
of
that
we
never
spoken
about
it
and
of
course
you
wo
need
me
any
more
like
you
did
then
but
it
looking
back
and
remembering
it
that
that
making
it
so
hard
to
leave
you
now
but
friends
have
been
talking
to
me

post
then
almost
angrily

try
for
it
it
come
after

my
cousin

the
man

who
wants
you
to
go
to

with

for
the
housekeeping

a
bad
way

it
is
i
never

nonsense

want
to
leave
me
wark
for
a
market
gardener
you

so
much
as

miss
levering
covered
her
discomfort
by
a
little
smiling
cousin
seen

many
a
time
she
likes
him
your
cousin
go
then
and
keep
his
house
for

woman
who

her
child

coral
beads

on
at
me
about

her
all
along

but
she
always

that
day
you

about

baby
and
gave
him
the
beads
to
play
with
and
let
her
make
him
cry
by
taking
them
away
ever
since
then
my
cousin
has
said
you
understand
would
i
understand
wark
laid
her
hand
on
the
nearest
of
the
shining
bars
of
brass
and
slowly
she
polished
it
with
her
open
palm
she
obviously
found
it
difficult
to
go
on
with
her
defence
wanted
my
cousin
to
come
and
explain
to
you
here
was
wark
in
a
new
light
indeed
if
she
really
wanted
any
creature
on
the
earth
to
speak
for
her
as
she
stood
there
in
stolid
embarrassment
polishing
the
shiny
bar
miss
levering
clutched
the
tray
to
steady
it
and
with
the
other
hand
she
pulled
the
pillow
higher
one
had
to
sit
bolt
upright
it
seemed
and
give
this
matter
one
entire
attention

want
to
talk
to
your
cousin
about
your
affairs
we
are
old
friends

her
eyes
to
meet
her
mistress

my
cousin

housekeeper
he
said
and
if

cousin

shall
hope
and
pray
he
wo
think

housekeeping

what
my
cousin
says
he
had
a
run
of
worthless
huzzies
i
do
expect
he
find
much
fault
with
housekeeping
after
what
he
been
through
vida
looked
wondering
at
the
triumphant
face
of
the
woman
so
you
ready
to
leave
me
after
all
these
years
miss
i
not
to
say
ready
but
i
think
i
have
to
go
poor
old
wark
the
lady
leaned
over
the
tray
could
almost
think
you
are
in
love
with
this
man
you
only
heard
about
miss
i
not
to
say
in
love
believe
you
are
for
what
other
reason
would
you
have
for
leaving
me
the
woman
looked
as
if
she
could
show
cause
had
she
a
mind
but
she
said
nothing
know
vida
pursued
know
quite
well
you
do
need
to
marry
for
a
home

quite
comfortable
of
course

time
goes
on
i
do
get
younger
of
us

that
wark
just
the
trouble
miss
it
ai
only
vida
looked
at
her
more
perplexed
than
ever
by
the
curious
regard
in
the
countenance
for
there
was
something
very
like
dumb
reproach
in
wark
face
said
miss
levering
know
even
if
none
of
us
do
get
younger
we
are
not
any
of
us
to
judge
by
appearances
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
even
if
i
should
be
smashed
up
in
a
motor
accident
i
know
you
always
expecting
that
even
if
i
were
killed
still
you
find
i
had
forgotten
you
wark
is
that
miss
it
is
death
i
afraid
of
there
was
a
pause
the
longest
that
yet
had
come
you
afraid
of
miss
levering
asked
you
see
i
been
looking
these
twelve
years
to
see
you
married
what
that
got
to
do
with
miss
you
see
i
counted
a
good
while
on
looking
after
children
again
some
day
but
if
you
wo
get
married
vida
flung
her
hair
back
with
a
burst
of
not
very
merry
laughter
i
wo
you
must
but
in
the
world
i
no
idea
you
were
so
romantic
why
must
there
be
a
wedding
in
the
family

can
be
children
miss
said
the
woman
stolidly
there
is
a
child

doris
miss
doris
the
woman
shook
her
head
she
got
a
good
nurse
i
say
it
though
she
calls
advice
interfering
and
miss
doris
has
got
a
mother
plain
that
wark
was
again
in
the
market
garden
got
a
mother
and
a
sort
of
a
father
and
she
got
a
governess
and
a
servant
to
carry
her
about
i
sometimes
think
what
miss
doris
needs
most
is
a
little
letting
alone
leastways
she
do
need
no
nor
miss
you
given
me
up
the
mistress
probed
wark
raised
her
red
eyes
course
miss
if
i
wrong
her
knuckly
hand
slid
down
from
the
brass
bar
and
she
came
round
to
the
side
of
the
bed
with
an
unmistakable
eagerness
in
her
face
going
to
get
married
i
do
see
as
i
leave
ye
the
lady
lips
twitched
with
an
instant
silent
laughter
but
there
was
something
else
than
laughter
in
her
eyes
i
buy
you
off
can
i
if
i
give
you
my
word
if
to
save
you
from
need
to
try
the
great
experiment
i
sacrifice
would
like
to
see
you
make
a
sacrifice
miss
wark
said
with
perfect
gravity
as
though
reconsidering
would
feel
it
so
much
i
dare
say
after
the
child
was
there
they
looked
at
one
another
it
children
you
yearn
for
my
poor
wark
you
waited
too
long
i
afraid
no
miss
she
spoke
with
a
fatuous
confidence
you
must
be
fifty
miss
but
she
met
her
mistress
eye
unflinching
he
the
market
gardener
he
been
married
before
he
got
three
girls
and
two
boys
vida
fell
back
against
the
pillow
a
handful
no
my
cousin
says
they
nice
children
it
would
have
been
funny
if
it
had
somehow
been
pathetic
to
see
how
instantly
she
was
on
the
defensive
healthy
and
hearty
my
cousin
says
all
but
the
little
one
she
hardly
thinks
they
raise
i
wish
your
market
gardener
had
confined
himself
to
raising
onions
and
cabbages
if
he
had
those
children
i
do
believe
dream
of
of
course
not
miss
but
it
seems
like
those
children
need
some
one
to
look
after
them
more
than
more
than
i
do
that
ought
to
be
true
of
is
little
more
than
a
baby
the
wooden
woman
offered
it
as
an
apology
the
tray
said
vida
from
the
look
on
her
face
you
would
say
she
knew
she
had
lost
the
faithfullest
of
servants
and
that
five
little
children
somewhere
in
a
market
garden
had
won
if
not
a
mother
at
least
a
doughty
champion
chapter
iv
no
matter
how
late
either
vida
levering
or
her
had
gone
to
bed
the
night
before
they
breakfasted
as
they
did
so
many
other
things
at
the
hour
held
to
be
most
advantageous
for
doris
was
sometimes
there
and
often
not
on
those
mornings
when
his
health
or
his
exertions
the
night
previous
did
not
prevent
his
appearance
there
was
little
conversation
at
the
breakfast
table
except
such
as
was
initiated
by
the
only
child
of
the
marriage
a
fragile
girl
of
ten
little
doris
owing
to
some
obscure
threat
of
made
much
of
her
progress
about
the
house
in
a
arms
but
hardly
so
borne
would
she
reach
the
threshold
of
the
breakfast
room
before
her
thin
little
voice
might
be
heard
calling
out
those
who
held
they
had
every
ground
for
disliking
the
old
man
would
have
been
surprised
to
watch
him
during
the
half
hour
that
ensued
ministering
to
the
rather
querulous
little
creature
adapting
his
tone
and
view
to
her
comprehension
with
an
art
that
plainly
took
its
inspiration
from
affection
if
doris
were
not
well
enough
to
come
down
read
his
letters
and
glanced
at
paper
directing
his
few
remarks
to
his
whom
he
sometimes
treated
in
such
a
way
as
would
have
given
a
stranger
the
impression
in
spite
of
the
lady
lack
of
response
that
there
was
some
secret
understanding
between
the
two
a
great
many
years
before
donald
had
tumbled
into
a
government
office
the
affairs
of
which
he
had
ultimately
got
into
such
excellent
running
order
that
with
a
few
hours
supervision
from
the
chief
each
week
his
clerks
were
easily
able
to
maintain
the
high
reputation
of
that
particular
department
of
the
public
service
what
did
with
the
rest
of
his
time
was
little
known
a
good
deal
of
it
was
spent
with
a
much
younger
bachelor
brother
near
brighton
at
least
this
was
the
family
legend
in
spite
of
his
undoubted
affection
for
his
child
little
of
his
leisure
was
wasted
at
home
when
people
looked
at
the
sallow
smileless
face
of
his
wife
they
did
blame
him
sometimes
when
a
general
sense
of
tension
and
anxiety
betrayed
his
presence
somewhere
in
the
great
dreary
house
and
the
master
yet
forbore
to
descend
for
the
early
meal
he
would
rejoice
the
heart
of
his
little
daughter
by
having
her
brought
to
his
room
to
make
tea
and
share
his
breakfast
on
these
occasions
a
sense
of
such
unexpected
surcease
from
care
prevailed
in
the
as
called
for
some
celebration
of
the
holiday
spirit
it
found
expression
in
the
inclination
of
the
two
women
to
linger
over
their
coffee
embracing
the
only
sure
opportunity
the
day
offered
for
confidential
exchange
one
of
these
occasions
was
the
morning
of
wark
warning
which
however
vida
determined
to
say
nothing
about
till
she
was
obliged
she
had
just
handed
up
her
cup
for
replenishing
when
the
door
opened
and
to
the
surprise
of
the
ladies
the
master
of
the
house
appeared
on
the
threshold
is
anything
the
matter
faltered
his
wife
half
rising
must
something
be
the
matter
that
i
venture
into
my
own
of
a
morning
no
only
i
thought
as
doris
did
come
you
were
breakfasting
upstairs
too
no
notice
being
taken
of
this
she
at
once
set
about
heating
water
for
no
one
expected
to
drink
tea
made
in
the
kitchen
thought
said
he
twitching
an
open
newspaper
off
the
table
and
folding
it
up
thought
i
asked
to
be
allowed
the
privilege
of
opening
my
paper
for
myself
has
been
touched
said
his
wife
anxiously
occupied
with
the
he
stopped
in
the
act
of
thrusting
the
paper
in
his
pocket
and
shook
it
do
you
call
this
is
my
she
said
ordered
an
extra
copy
because
you
dislike
so
to
have
yours
looked
at
till
you
finished
with
it
hardship
is
he
said
glancing
round
and
seeing
his
own
particular
paper
neatly
folded
and
lying
still
on
the
side
table
was
no
great
hardship
when
you
read
it
before
night
when
you
do
it
rather
long
to
wait
wait
for
what
the
news
of
the
day
you
get
the
news
of
the
day
in
the
do
get
such
full
parliamentary
reports
nor
the
foreign
correspondence
lord
what
next
think
you
must
blame
me
said
vida
speaking
for
the
first
time
afraid
you
find
it
only
since
i
been
here
that
janet
has
broken
loose
and
taken
in
an
extra
copy
it
on
your
account
is
it
he
grumbled
but
the
edge
had
gone
out
of
his
suppose
you
to
keep
up
with
politics
or
you
could
keep
the
ball
rolling
as
you
did
last
night
said
vida
with
an
innocent
air
is
well
known
what
superhuman
efforts
we
have
to
make
before
we
can
qualify
ourselves
to
talk
to
men
grumbled
never
saw
at
a
loss
did
last
night
i
did
i
saw
you
getting
on
like
a
house
afire
with
haycroft
and
the
beguiling
borrodaile
it
a
pity
all
the
decent
men
are
married
allowed
her
own
coffee
to
get
cold
while
she
hovered
over
the
sacred
rite
of
scientific
talking
to
vida
about
the
foreign
office
reception
to
which
they
had
all
gone
on
after
the
tunbridges
dinner
kept
watching
with
a
kind
of
scorn
his
wife
fussily
punctilious
pains
to
prepare
the
brew
way
when
all
was
ready
and
the
tea
steaming
on
its
way
to
him
in
the
hands
of
its
harassed
maker
he
curtly
declined
it
got
up
and
left
the
room
a
moment
after
the
shutting
of
the
front
door
announced
the
beginning
of
yet
another
of
the
master
absences
can
you
stand
it
said
vida
under
her
breath
i
do
mind
his
going
away
said
the
other
dully
but
his
coming
back
of
the
things
i
grateful
to
donald
for
she
spoke
as
if
there
were
plenty
more
is
very
good
to
you
vida
and
in
her
tone
there
was
criticism
of
the
beneficiary
mean
he
not
as
rude
to
me
as
he
is
to
you
is
even
forbearing
and
you
you
rather
frighten
me
sometimes
see
that
would
be
very
terrible
for
if
he
took
it
into
his
head
not
to
like
you
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
forbid
your
having
me
here
you
mean
even
when
you
are
polite
he
just
laughs
still
he
not
a
patient
man
you
think
you
have
to
tell
me
that
dear
only
to
remind
you
not
to
try
him
too
far
for
my
sake
vida
do
ever
do
that
she
put
out
her
yellow
hand
and
her
sister
closed
hers
over
it
an
instant
the
hot
milk
said
vida
we
have
some
more
coffee
you
coming
with
me
asked
quite
cheerfully
for
her
as
the
servant
shut
the
door
is
this
friday
n
no
the
younger
woman
looked
at
the
chill
grey
world
through
the
window
and
followed
up
the
hesitating
negative
with
a
quite
definite
could
stand
slums
the
two
exchanged
the
look
that
means
we
are
again
up
against
this
recurring
difference
but
there
was
no
in
either
face
as
their
eyes
met
between
these
two
daughters
of
one
father
existed
that
sort
of
haunting
family
resemblance
often
seen
between
two
closely
related
persons
despite
one
being
attractive
and
the
other
in
some
way
repellent
the
observer
traces
the
same
lines
in
each
face
the
same
intensification
of
family
look
in
the
smile
and
yet
knows
that
the
slight
disparity
in
age
fails
to
account
for
a
difference
wide
as
the
poles
and
not
alone
difference
of
taste
of
environment
and
experience
not
these
alone
make
up
the
sum
of
their
unlikeness
you
had
only
to
look
from
the
fresh
simplicity
of
white
muslin
blouse
and
cloth
in
the
one
case
to
the
ungainly
expensiveness
of
the
black
silk
gown
of
the
married
woman
in
order
to
get
from
the
first
a
sense
of
dainty
morning
freshness
and
from
not
alone
a
lugubrious
sort
of
impression
but
that
more
disquieting
reminder
of
the
ugly
and
thing
life
is
to
many
an
estimable
soul
janet
had
the
art
of
rubbing
this
dark
fact
in
till
so
to
speak
the
black
came
off
she
seemed
to
achieve
it
partly
by
dint
of
wearing
instead
of
any
relief
of
lace
or
even
of
linen
at
her
throat
a
hard
band
of
that
passementerie
secretly
so
despised
of
the
little
tunbridges
this
device
did
not
so
much
off
the
neck
of
gowns
as
allow
the
funereal
dulness
of
them
to
overflow
on
to
her
brown
neck
it
even
cast
an
added
shadow
on
her
sallow
cheek
the
figure
of
the
older
woman
gaunt
and
thin
enough
announced
the
further
constriction
of
the
corset
by
way
of
revenge
the
sharp
poked
the
corset
out
till
it
defined
a
ridge
in
the
black
silk
back
in
front
too
the
figure
declined
with
the
corset
and
withdrew
leaving
a
hiatus
that
the
silk
bodice
clothed
though
it
did
not
conceal
you
could
not
have
told
whether
the
other
woman
wore
that
ancient
invention
for
a
figure
insufficient
or
as
you
followed
her
movements
easy
with
the
ease
of
a
child
while
she
walked
or
stooped
or
caught
up
the
fragile
doris
or
raised
her
arm
to
take
a
book
from
the
shelf
you
got
an
impression
of
a
physique
in
perfect
because
unconscious
harmony
with
its
environment
if
on
the
contrary
you
watched
but
so
much
as
the
nervous
uncertain
hand
of
the
other
woman
you
would
know
here
was
one
who
had
spent
her
years
in
alternately
grasping
the
nettle
and
letting
it
go
reaping
only
stings
in
life
fair
fields
easy
for
any
one
seeing
her
in
these
days
though
she
was
to
share
freddy
incredulous
astonishment
at
hearing
from
haycroft
the
night
before
that
janet
levering
had
been
beauty
of
her
family
freddy
answer
had
been
make
fun
of
her
and
haycroft
had
had
to
assure
her
of
his
seriousness
while
the
little
hostess
still
stared
uncertain
of
her
face
are
rather
good
she
admitted
but
those
yellow
and
pink
eyes
and
her
general
muddiness
yes
sir
william
had
agreed
changed
so
that
i
would
never
have
known
her
but
her
colouring
used
to
be
her
strong
point
i
assure
you
she
was
magnificent
oh
much
more
striking
than
the
younger
sister
the
woman
who
sat
uneasily
at
her
own
board
clutching
at
a
thin
fragment
of
cold
dry
toast
that
hung
cheerlessly
awry
in
the
silver
rack
like
the
last
brown
leaf
to
a
frosty
tree
while
she
crunched
the
toast
spoke
dryly
of
the
poor
of
how
many
of
them
are
how
when
you
take
the
trouble
to
understand
them
you
no
longer
lump
them
all
together
in
a
featureless
misery
you
realize
how
significant
and
varied
are
their
lives
half
as
significant
and
varied
as
their
smells
said
her
unchastened
sister
you
sometimes
talk
as
if
you
had
no
heart
trouble
is
i
have
no
stomach
when
you
lured
me
into
one
of
those
dingy
alleys
and
that
greasy
smell
of
poverty
comes
flooding
into
my
face
well
simply
all
my
most
uncharitable
feelings
rise
up
in
revolt
i
want
to
hold
my
nose
and
hide
my
eyes
and
call
for
the
running
away
is
fast
enough
she
said
with
energy
and
a
sudden
spark
in
her
eye
poised
the
fat
silver
jug
over
her
own
belated
cup
and
waited
for
the
thick
cream
to
come
out
in
a
slow
and
grudging
gobbet
with
a
heavy
plump
into
the
coffee
as
she
waited
she
gently
rebuked
that
fastidiousness
in
her
companion
that
shrank
from
contact
with
the
unsavoury
and
the
unfortunate
is
only
my
fastidiousness
as
you
call
it
that
is
offended
vida
retorted
am
penetrated
by
the
hopelessness
of
what
we
doing
it
salves
my
conscience
or
hurriedly
she
added
that
not
what
you
mean
to
do
it
for
i
dear
and
an
angel
and
i
a
mere
cumberer
of
the
earth
but
when
i
only
just
cumbering
i
feel
less
a
fraud
than
when
i
pretending
to
do
good
need
pretend
ca
do
anything
else
to
go
among
your
poor
makes
me
feel
in
my
heart
that
i
simply
flaunting
my
better
fortune
never
saw
you
flaunting
it
i
assure
you
it
when
you
got
me
to
go
with
you
on
one
of
your
whitechapel
raids
that
i
feel
most
strongly
how
outrageous
it
is
that
in
addition
to
all
my
other
advantages
i
should
buy
by
doing
some
service
to
a
toiling
starving
set
down
her
must
suppose
she
began
no
vida
cut
her
short
do
doubt
motives
i
know
too
well
how
ready
you
are
to
sacrifice
yourself
but
it
does
fill
me
with
a
kind
of
rage
to
see
some
of
those
smug
settlement
workers
the
people
that
plume
themselves
on
leaving
luxurious
homes
they
do
say
how
hideously
bored
they
were
in
them
they
are
perfectly
enchanted
at
the
excitement
and
importance
they
get
out
of
going
to
live
among
the
poor
who
do
want
them
my
dear
vida
a
little
bit
well
the
paupers
do
perhaps
for
what
they
can
get
out
of
our
sort
cast
down
her
eyes
as
though
convicted
by
the
recollection
of
some
concrete
example
only
scratching
at
the
surface
vida
said
an
ugly
surface
too
and
the
more
we
scratch
the
uglier
things
come
to
light
make
too
much
of
that
disappointment
at
christmas
was
even
thinking
of
the
hundredth
time
you
been
disillusioned
vida
threw
down
her
table
napkin
and
stood
up
was
thinking
of
people
like
our
young
parson
cousin
vida
made
a
shrug
of
assent
the
bishop
palace
and
comes
to
london
he
too
wants
to
live
for
the
poor
never
for
an
instant
one
of
them
always
the
patron
the
person
something
may
be
got
out
of
or
at
all
events
hoped
from
she
seemed
to
be
about
to
leave
the
room
but
as
her
sister
answered
with
some
feeling
no
they
love
and
respect
him
vida
paused
and
brought
up
by
the
fire
that
the
sudden
cold
made
comforting
is
a
different
man
since
he
found
his
vocation
insisted
read
it
in
his
face
if
all
you
mean
is
that
happier
why
not
he
able
to
look
on
himself
as
a
benefactor
he
tasting
the
intoxication
of
the
king
among
beggars
are
grossly
unfair
vida
he
thinks
when
i
challenge
him
what
good
what
earthly
good
is
all
this
unless
an
anodyne
for
you
is
good
seems
to
me
a
very
real
good
that
george
nuneaton
and
his
kind
should
go
into
the
dark
places
and
brighten
hopeless
lives
with
a
little
christian
kindness
sometimes
with
a
little
timely
counsel
yes
said
the
voice
by
the
fire
a
little
good
music
forget
the
good
music
in
practical
religion
is
that
something
good
heaven
a
handful
of
complacent
expensively
educated
young
people
playing
at
reform
the
poor
wanting
work
wanting
decent
housing
wanting
and
offered
a
little
cultivated
companionship
what
have
you
been
reading
i
been
visiting
george
at
his
settlement
i
been
intruding
myself
on
the
privacy
of
the
poor
once
a
week
with
you
and
i
done
with
it
personally
i
do
get
enough
out
of
it
to
reconcile
me
to
their
getting
so
little
burning
observed
the
toneless
voice
from
the
head
of
the
table
i
believe
i
was
a
little
hot
vida
laughed
as
she
drew
her
smoking
skirt
away
from
the
fire
but
she
still
stood
close
to
the
cheerful
blaze
one
foot
on
the
fender
the
green
cloth
skirt
drawn
up
leaving
the
more
delicate
fabric
of
her
silk
petticoat
to
meet
the
fiery
ordeal
it
annoys
you
to
hear
me
say
that
my
view
of
charity
why
do
make
me
talk
about
it
but
the
face
she
turned
for
an
instant
over
her
shoulder
was
far
gentler
than
her
words
do
in
future
she
was
again
looking
down
into
the
fire
and
she
spoke
slowly
as
one
who
delivers
a
reluctant
ultimatum
ask
me
to
help
except
with
money
does
cost
so
much
am
disappointed
nothing
further
but
the
sound
of
a
chair
moved
back
eloquent
somehow
of
a
discouragement
deeper
than
words
conveyed
vida
turned
swiftly
and
coming
back
to
her
sister
laid
an
arm
about
her
shoulder
a
perfect
monster
but
you
know
my
dear
you
rather
goaded
me
into
saying
all
this
by
looking
such
a
martyr
when
i
tried
to
get
out
of
going
well
i
wo
ask
you
again
but
the
toneless
rejoinder
was
innocent
of
rancour
janet
gave
the
impression
of
being
too
chilled
too
drained
of
the
generous
even
for
anger
said
vida
hurriedly
nearly
forgotten
there
the
final
practising
at
eleven
forgotten
your
charity
concert
was
so
near
as
gathered
up
her
letters
she
gave
way
for
the
first
time
to
a
wintry
little
smile
concert
mine
i
admit
but
the
charity
the
bishop
what
absurd
things
we
women
fill
up
the
holes
in
our
lives
with
vida
said
as
she
followed
her
sister
into
the
hall
you
know
the
real
reason
i
getting
up
this
foolish
concert
you
like
singing
and
do
it
so
well
that
yes
without
your
looks
and
the
indescribable
rest
you
be
a
success
i
told
you
that
when
i
begged
you
to
come
and
try
london
reason
i
slaving
over
the
concert
it
is
all
musical
enthusiasm
it
amuses
me
to
organize
it
all
the
ticklish
difficult
bothering
part
of
getting
up
a
monster
thing
of
this
sort
reconciling
malcontents
enlisting
the
great
operatic
stars
and
not
losing
the
great
social
lights
it
all
interests
me
like
a
game
i
afraid
the
truth
is
i
like
managing
things
freddy
not
so
far
wrong
freddy
accuse
me
of
being
a
managing
woman
horrid
thought
was
talking
about
you
in
her
enthusiastic
way
when
she
was
here
the
other
day
vida
could
administer
a
state
she
said
yes
laughed
too
but
freddy
shook
her
head
quite
seriously
and
said
to
think
of
a
being
like
vida
not
even
a
citizen
not
a
citizen
exclaimed
the
lady
laughing
down
at
her
sister
over
the
banisters
she
think
because
i
lived
abroad
forfeited
my
rights
of
all
she
means
is
oh
you
know
the
bee
she
got
in
her
bonnet
she
means
as
she
tell
you
that
you
have
no
more
voice
in
the
affairs
of
england
than
if
you
were
a
hottentot
ca
say
i
ever
minded
that
but
it
has
an
odd
sound
it
to
hear
one
is
a
citizen
freddy
forgets
know
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
said
the
other
freddy
forgets
our
unique
ennobling
influence
and
the
tall
young
woman
laughed
as
she
ran
up
the
last
half
of
the
long
flight
of
stairs
at
the
top
she
halted
a
moment
and
called
down
to
who
was
examining
the
cards
left
the
day
before
of
our
powerful
influence
over
our
freddy
was
present
was
he
when
she
aired
her
views
thought
not
her
influence
over
freddy
is
maintained
by
the
strictest
silence
on
matters
he
is
keen
about
chapter
v
seeing
ulland
house
for
the
first
time
on
a
fine
afternoon
in
early
may
against
the
jubilant
green
of
its
woodland
hillside
the
beholder
a
little
dazzled
in
that
first
instant
by
the
warmth
of
colour
burning
in
the
ancient
brick
might
adapt
the
old
dean
line
and
call
the
structure
rambling
down
the
hillside
dwelling
half
as
old
as
time
its
original
architecture
had
been
modified
by
the
generations
as
they
passed
one
lord
of
ulland
had
expressed
his
fancy
on
the
eastern
facade
in
gable
and
sculptured
gargoyle
another
his
fear
or
his
defiance
in
the
squat
and
sturdy
tower
with
its
cautious
slits
in
lieu
of
windows
yet
another
ulland
had
brought
home
from
italy
a
love
of
colonnades
and
terraced
gardens
and
one
still
later
had
cut
down
to
the
level
of
the
sward
the
high
windows
so
that
where
before
had
been
two
doors
or
three
were
now
a
dozen
giving
egress
to
the
gardens
the
legend
so
often
encountered
in
the
history
of
old
english
houses
was
not
neglected
here
that
it
had
been
a
crusader
of
this
family
who
had
himself
brought
home
from
the
holy
land
the
lebanon
cedar
that
spread
wide
its
level
branches
on
the
west
cutting
the
sunset
into
even
bars
tradition
also
said
it
was
a
counsellor
of
elizabeth
who
had
set
the
dial
on
the
lawn
even
the
latest
lord
had
found
a
way
to
leave
his
impress
upon
the
time
he
introduced
golf
at
ulland
from
the
upper
windows
on
the
south
and
west
the
roving
eye
was
caught
by
the
great
staring
face
of
this
new
timepiece
on
the
turf
its
roman
numerals
showing
keen
and
white
upon
the
vivid
green
on
the
other
side
of
the
cedar
that
incorrigible
hedonist
the
crumbling
dial
told
you
in
latin
that
he
only
marked
the
shining
hours
but
the
brand
new
clock
on
the
lawn
bore
neither
watchword
nor
device
seemed
even
to
have
dropped
its
hands
as
though
in
modesty
withheld
from
pointing
to
hours
so
little
worthy
of
record
two
or
three
men
on
this
fine
saturday
had
come
down
from
london
for
the
to
disport
themselves
on
the
ulland
links
half
a
mile
beyond
the
park
after
a
couple
of
raw
days
the
afternoon
had
turned
out
quite
unseasonably
warm
and
though
the
golfers
had
come
back
earlier
than
usual
not
because
of
the
heat
but
because
one
of
their
number
had
a
train
to
catch
they
agreed
it
was
distinctly
reviving
to
find
tea
served
out
of
doors
already
lady
john
was
in
her
place
on
the
pillared
colonnade
behind
the
urn
already
too
one
of
her
pair
of
pretty
nieces
was
at
hand
to
play
the
skilful
lieutenant
hermione
heriot
tactful
charming
was
equally
ready
to
hand
bread
and
butter
or
sitting
quietly
to
perform
the
greater
service
that
of
presenting
the
vision
called
typical
english
girl
miss
heriot
fulfilled
to
a
nicety
the
requirements
of
those
who
are
sensibly
reassured
by
the
spectacle
of
careful
conventionality
allied
to
feminine
charm
a
pleasant
conversability
that
may
be
trusted
to
soothe
and
counted
on
never
to
startle
hermione
would
almost
as
soon
have
stood
on
her
head
in
piccadilly
as
have
said
anything
original
though
to
her
private
consternation
such
perilous
stuff
had
been
known
to
harbour
an
uneasy
instant
in
her
bosom
she
carried
such
inconvenient
cargo
as
carefully
hidden
as
a
conspirator
would
a
bomb
under
his
cloak
it
had
grown
to
be
as
necessary
to
her
to
agree
with
the
views
and
fashions
of
the
majority
as
it
was
disquieting
to
her
to
see
these
contravened
or
even
for
a
single
hour
ignored
from
the
crown
of
her
carefully
dressed
head
to
the
tips
of
her
pointed
toes
she
was
engaged
in
testifying
her
assent
to
the
prevailing
note
despite
all
this
to
recommend
her
she
was
not
lady
john
favourite
niece
no
doubt
about
jean
dunbarton
holding
that
honour
and
to
hermione
credit
her
own
love
for
her
cousin
enabled
her
to
accept
the
situation
with
a
creditable
equability
jean
dunbarton
was
due
now
at
any
moment
she
having
already
sent
over
her
luggage
with
her
maid
the
short
two
miles
from
the
bishop
palace
where
the
girl
had
dined
and
slept
the
night
before
the
rest
of
the
ulland
house
party
were
arriving
by
the
next
train
as
miss
levering
was
understood
to
be
one
of
those
expected
it
will
be
seen
that
a
justified
faith
in
the
excellence
of
the
ulland
links
had
not
made
lady
john
unmindful
of
the
wisdom
of
including
among
a
nice
assortment
of
pretty
women
for
the
amusement
of
her
golfers
in
the
off
hours
of
this
other
young
lady
swinging
her
golf
club
as
she
came
across
the
lawn
with
the
men
sole
petticoat
among
them
it
could
not
be
pretended
that
any
hostess
let
alone
one
so
as
lady
john
ulland
would
look
to
have
the
high
and
delicate
office
performed
by
so
upright
and
downright
not
to
say
so
bony
a
young
woman
with
face
so
like
a
horse
and
the
stride
of
a
grenadier
under
her
short
skirt
the
great
feet
seemed
shamelessly
to
court
attention
as
it
were
out
of
malice
to
catch
your
eye
while
deliberately
they
trampled
on
the
tenderest
traditions
clinging
still
about
the
weaker
sex
lady
john
held
in
her
hand
the
top
of
the
jade
and
silver
hermione
as
well
as
her
aunt
knew
that
this
top
held
four
teaspoonsful
of
tea
lady
john
filled
it
once
filled
it
twice
and
turned
the
contents
out
each
time
into
the
gaping
pot
then
she
paused
eyeing
the
approaching
party
that
genial
despot
her
husband
walking
with
lord
borrodaile
the
gawky
girl
between
them
except
when
she
paused
to
practise
a
drive
the
fourth
person
a
short
compactly
knit
man
was
lounging
along
several
paces
behind
but
every
now
and
then
energetically
shouting
out
his
share
in
the
conversation
the
ground
of
lady
john
interest
in
the
group
seemed
to
consist
in
a
counting
of
noses
her
eyes
came
back
to
the
and
she
made
a
third
addition
to
the
jade
and
silver
measure
shall
be
only
six
for
the
first
brew
prompted
the
girl
at
her
side
filey
is
mooning
somewhere
about
the
garden
do
you
say
it
like
that
hermione
eyes
rested
a
moment
on
the
golfer
who
was
bringing
up
the
rear
he
was
younger
than
his
rather
set
figure
had
at
a
distance
proclaimed
him
was
only
thinking
dick
farnborough
ca
abide
paul
said
the
girl
typical
product
of
the
public
school
is
hardly
likely
to
appreciate
an
undisciplined
creature
with
a
streak
of
genius
in
him
like
paul
filey
i
rather
love
him
myself
said
the
girl
lightly
as
sophia
says
he
does
talk
rather
rot
at
times
with
her
hand
on
the
releasing
a
stream
of
boiling
water
into
the
pot
lady
john
glanced
over
the
small
thickset
angel
that
poised
himself
on
one
podgy
foot
upon
the
lid
of
the
urn
too
free
with
her
tongue
it
a
mistake
it
frightens
people
off
you
mean
men
often
think
said
the
young
woman
men
all
except
paul
would
be
more
shocked
at
sophia
if
she
was
who
she
is
doubt
agreed
her
aunt
i
sympathize
with
her
parents
i
do
see
how
they
ever
marry
her
she
might
just
as
well
be
miss
jones
that
girl
for
all
she
makes
of
herself
i
often
thought
so
too
agreed
hermione
apparently
conscious
that
the
very
most
was
made
of
has
even
been
taught
to
walk
lady
john
was
still
watching
the
girl
approach
she
looks
best
out
of
doors
said
hermione
firmly
yes
she
comes
into
the
as
if
she
were
crossing
a
ploughed
field
the
same
said
hermione
under
her
breath
she
indoors
i
rather
see
her
walking
than
sitting
mean
the
way
she
crosses
her
legs
that
too
it
seems
like
so
many
other
things
a
question
only
of
degree
nobody
objects
to
seeing
a
pair
of
neat
ankles
crossed
it
looks
rather
nice
and
early
victorian
nowadays
lots
of
girls
cross
their
knees
and
nobody
says
anything
but
sophia
crosses
her
well
her
and
the
two
women
laughed
understandingly
a
stranger
might
imagine
that
the
reason
for
lady
sophia
presence
in
the
party
was
that
she
by
common
consent
played
a
capital
game
of
golf
a
woman
that
fact
however
was
rather
against
her
for
people
who
can
play
the
beguiling
game
to
play
it
and
want
to
play
it
not
merely
now
and
then
out
of
public
spirit
to
make
up
a
foursome
but
constantly
and
for
pure
selfish
love
of
it
woman
may
if
she
likes
take
it
as
a
compliment
to
her
sex
that
this
proclivity
held
to
be
wholly
natural
in
a
man
is
called
unfeminine
in
a
woman
but
it
was
a
defect
like
the
rest
forgiven
the
lady
sophia
for
her
father
sake
lord
borrodaile
held
to
be
one
of
the
most
delightful
of
men
was
much
in
request
for
parties
of
this
description
one
reason
for
his
daughter
being
there
was
that
it
glossed
the
fact
that
lady
borrodaile
was
not
was
indeed
seldom
present
and
one
may
say
never
missed
in
the
houses
frequented
by
her
husband
but
as
he
and
his
friends
not
only
did
not
belong
to
but
looked
down
upon
the
ultra
smart
set
where
the
larger
freedoms
are
practised
in
lieu
of
the
lesser
decencies
lord
borrodaile
lived
his
life
as
far
removed
from
any
touch
of
scandal
and
irregularity
as
the
most
puritanic
of
the
bourgeoisie
part
and
parcel
of
his
fastidiousness
some
said
others
that
from
his
eton
days
he
had
always
been
a
lazy
beggar
as
though
to
show
that
he
did
not
shrink
from
reasonable
responsibility
towards
his
female
impedimenta
any
inquiry
as
to
the
absence
of
lady
borrodaile
was
met
by
reference
to
sophia
in
short
where
other
attractive
husbands
brought
a
boring
wife
lord
borrodaile
brought
an
undecorative
daughter
while
to
the
onlooker
nearly
every
aspect
of
this
particular
young
woman
would
seem
destined
to
offend
a
critical
taste
like
that
of
borrodaile
he
was
probably
served
as
other
mortals
are
by
that
philosophy
of
the
senses
which
brings
in
time
a
deafness
and
a
blindness
to
the
unloveliness
that
we
needs
must
live
beside
lord
borrodaile
was
far
too
intelligent
not
to
see
too
that
when
people
had
got
over
lady
sophia
uncompromising
exterior
they
found
things
in
her
to
admire
as
well
as
to
stand
a
little
in
awe
of
unlike
one
another
as
the
borrodailes
were
in
one
respect
they
presented
to
the
world
an
undivided
front
from
their
point
of
view
just
as
laws
existed
to
keep
other
people
in
order
so
was
an
affair
for
the
middle
classes
the
borrodailes
might
dress
as
dowdily
as
they
pleased
might
speak
as
uncompromisingly
as
they
felt
inclined
were
they
not
borrodailes
of
borrodaile
though
open
expression
of
this
spirit
grows
less
common
they
would
not
have
denied
that
it
is
still
the
prevailing
temper
of
the
older
aristocracy
and
so
it
has
hitherto
been
true
that
among
its
women
you
find
that
sort
of
freedom
which
is
the
prerogative
of
those
called
the
highest
and
of
those
called
the
lowest
it
is
the
women
of
all
the
grades
between
these
two
extremes
who
have
dared
not
to
be
themselves
who
ape
the
manners
echo
the
catchwords
and
garb
themselves
in
the
elaborate
ugliness
devised
for
the
blind
meek
millions
as
the
lady
sophia
now
a
little
in
advance
of
her
companions
came
stalking
towards
the
steps
out
from
a
little
path
that
wound
among
the
laurels
issued
paul
filey
he
raised
his
eyes
and
hurriedly
thrust
a
small
book
into
his
pocket
the
young
lady
paused
but
only
apparently
to
pat
or
rather
to
administer
an
approving
cuff
to
the
bedlington
terrier
lying
near
the
lower
step
she
said
over
her
shoulder
to
filey
side
gave
a
good
account
of
itself
that
last
round
was
sure
it
would
as
soon
as
my
malign
influence
was
removed
from
the
moment
i
took
on
dick
farnborough
the
situation
assumed
a
new
aspect
you
play
a
good
game
you
know
if
you
go
quoting
baudelaire
on
the
links
paul
his
hostess
murmured
to
her
niece
always
tremble
when
i
see
him
exposed
to
sophia
ruthless
handling
whispered
hermione
says
she
sure
he
thinks
of
himself
as
a
prose
shelley
and
for
some
reason
that
infuriates
sophia
with
a
somewhat
forced
air
of
amusement
filey
was
following
his
critic
up
the
steps
she
still
mocking
at
his
and
the
way
he
negotiated
his
bunkers
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
little
terrace
whose
turf
was
level
with
the
flagged
floor
of
the
colonnade
filey
sought
refuge
near
hermione
as
the
barque
fleeing
before
the
wind
hies
swift
to
the
nearest
haven
bending
over
the
bedlington
the
amazon
remained
on
the
top
step
her
long
rather
good
figure
garbed
in
stuff
which
filey
had
said
was
fit
only
for
but
which
was
harris
tweed
slackly
belted
by
a
broad
canvas
girdle
drawn
through
a
buckle
of
steel
you
tell
me
he
moaned
in
hermione
ear
the
daughter
of
a
hundred
earls
has
the
manners
of
a
groom
and
dresses
herself
in
odds
and
ends
of
the
harness
room
somebody
told
her
once
you
said
something
of
that
sort
he
said
was
i
course
not
but
did
she
mind
what
did
she
say
eh
only
said
he
got
that
out
of
a
novel
of
miss
broughton
filey
looked
a
little
dashed
has
miss
broughton
said
it
too
then
there
are
more
of
them
he
glanced
again
at
the
amazon
thought
be
so
unreasonable
she
could
play
golf
in
a
long
skirt
and
high
heels
a
woman
to
play
golf
hermione
gave
him
his
tea
with
a
smile
she
knew
with
an
absolute
precision
just
how
perfectly
at
that
moment
she
herself
was
presenting
the
average
man
picture
of
the
ideal
type
of
reposeful
womanhood
as
lord
john
and
the
two
other
men
his
companions
came
up
the
steps
in
the
midst
of
a
discussion
you
stop
to
argue
farnborough
said
lady
john
holding
out
a
cup
wo
have
time
for
tea
before
you
catch
that
train
thank
you
he
hastened
to
relieve
her
while
hermione
murmured
regrets
that
he
was
staying
john
did
ask
me
he
confided
as
he
saw
in
hermione
face
a
project
to
intercede
for
him
he
added
now
i
promised
my
mother
we
got
a
lot
of
people
coming
and
two
men
short
men
short
how
horrible
for
her
she
said
it
half
laughing
but
her
view
of
the
reality
of
the
dilemma
was
apparent
in
her
letting
the
subject
drop
farnborough
standing
there
in
hand
joined
again
in
the
discussion
that
was
going
on
about
some
unnamed
politician
of
the
day
with
whose
character
and
destiny
the
future
of
england
might
quite
conceivably
be
involved
before
a
great
while
this
unnamed
person
would
be
succeeding
his
ailing
and
childless
brother
there
were
lamentations
in
prospect
of
his
too
early
translation
to
the
upper
house
the
older
men
had
been
speaking
of
his
family
in
which
the
tradition
of
public
service
generations
old
had
been
revived
in
the
person
of
this
younger
son
have
never
understood
lord
john
was
saying
a
man
with
such
opportunities
has
done
more
man
as
able
too
said
borrodaile
lazily
of
the
tribute
he
wrung
out
of
gladstone
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
career
whatever
we
may
think
of
the
old
fox
gladstone
had
an
eye
for
men
will
you
lady
sophia
administered
a
little
whack
to
the
bedlington
joey
do
you
hear
they
talking
about
our
cousin
said
filey
bending
over
the
lady
with
a
of
cake
geoffrey
stonor
answered
sophia
it
stonor
they
mean
of
course
do
you
know
demanded
filey
in
the
pause
wherever
there
are
two
or
three
gathered
together
talking
politics
and
the
coming
man
who
has
such
a
frightful
lot
in
him
that
very
little
ever
comes
out
it
sure
to
be
geoffrey
stonor
they
mean
it
joey
said
her
father
dryly
just
mention
that
to
him
at
dinner
said
farnborough
with
a
keen
look
in
his
eyes
mean
he
coming
here
sophia
too
had
looked
round
at
her
host
with
frank
interest
to
play
golf
he
may
get
here
in
time
for
a
round
but
we
rather
expecting
him
by
this
fun
lady
sophia
long
face
had
brightened
i
stay
over
till
the
next
train
farnborough
was
whispering
to
lady
john
as
he
went
round
to
her
on
the
pretext
of
more
cream
you
then
i
wo
go
till
the
six
did
know
lady
sophia
was
observing
in
her
somewhat
crude
way
you
knew
geoffrey
as
well
as
all
that
do
said
lord
john
been
saying
for
years
he
wanted
to
come
down
and
try
our
links
but
it
by
a
fluke
that
he
coming
after
all
never
comes
to
see
he
far
too
busy
ai
he
joey
even
if
we
ca
see
that
he
accomplishes
much
him
time
and
you
see
said
farnborough
with
a
wag
of
his
head
said
lord
john
still
a
young
man
barely
forty
forty
believe
in
prolonging
their
youth
do
they
said
lady
sophia
to
no
one
in
particular
and
with
her
mouth
rather
more
full
of
cake
than
custom
prescribes
thing
it
is
us
ai
it
joey
a
politician
forty
young
said
farnborough
do
i
know
it
she
retorted
was
reading
the
life
of
randolph
churchill
the
other
day
and
i
came
across
a
paragraph
of
filial
admiration
about
the
hold
lord
randolph
had
contrived
to
get
so
early
in
life
over
the
house
of
commons
it
occurred
to
me
to
wonder
just
how
much
of
a
boy
lord
randolph
was
at
the
time
i
was
going
to
count
up
when
i
was
saved
the
trouble
by
coming
to
a
sentence
that
said
he
was
then
an
unproved
stripling
of
you
should
laugh
it
was
meant
sarcastic
you
leader
of
the
opposition
i
suppose
it
not
very
easy
to
do
much
while
your
party
out
of
power
hazarded
lady
john
it
of
the
most
interesting
things
about
our
coming
back
will
be
to
watch
stonor
said
farnborough
all
they
said
he
did
very
well
with
his
under
secretaryship
under
the
last
government
did
they
again
lady
john
appealed
to
the
two
elder
men
yes
said
borrodaile
yes
the
way
farnborough
made
up
for
any
lack
of
enthusiasm
way
he
handled
that
balkan
question
that
was
pure
routine
lord
john
waved
it
aside
if
stonor
had
ever
looked
upon
politics
as
more
than
a
game
he
have
been
a
power
long
before
this
said
borrodaile
slowly
go
as
far
as
that
i
doubt
myself
if
he
has
enough
of
the
demagogue
in
him
that
just
why
the
english
people
are
not
like
the
americans
or
the
french
the
english
have
a
natural
distrust
of
the
demagogue
i
tell
you
if
stonor
once
believed
in
anything
with
might
and
main
he
be
a
leader
of
men
he
is
now
farnborough
was
the
first
to
distinguish
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
behind
the
shrubberies
the
others
looked
up
and
listened
yes
the
crunch
of
gravel
the
wall
of
laurel
was
too
thick
to
give
any
glimpse
from
this
side
of
the
drive
that
wound
round
to
the
main
entrance
but
some
animating
vision
nevertheless
seemed
miraculously
to
have
penetrated
the
dense
green
wall
to
the
obvious
enlivenment
of
the
company
rather
exciting
seeing
him
at
close
quarters
hermione
said
to
filey
he
the
only
politician
i
can
get
up
any
real
enthusiasm
for
he
so
i
saw
him
yesterday
at
a
bond
street
show
looking
at
caricatures
of
himself
and
all
his
dearest
friends
how
did
he
take
the
sacrilege
he
was
immensely
amused
at
the
fellow
impudence
you
see
stonor
could
understand
the
art
of
the
thing
as
well
as
the
fun
the
fierce
economy
of
line
nobody
listened
there
were
other
attempts
at
conversation
mere
decent
pretence
at
not
being
absorbed
in
watching
for
the
appearance
of
geoffrey
stonor
chapter
vi
there
was
the
faint
sound
of
a
distant
door
opening
and
there
was
a
glimpse
of
the
old
butler
but
before
he
could
reach
the
french
window
with
his
announcement
his
own
colourless
presence
was
masked
wiped
out
not
as
the
company
had
expected
by
the
apparition
of
a
man
but
by
a
tall
young
woman
with
eyes
and
wearing
a
gown
that
had
touches
of
wallflower
red
and
gold
on
the
short
jacket
there
were
only
wallflowers
in
the
small
toque
and
except
for
the
sable
boa
in
her
hand
which
so
suddenly
it
was
too
warm
to
wear
no
single
thing
about
her
could
at
all
adequately
account
for
the
air
of
what
for
lack
of
a
better
term
may
be
called
accessory
elegance
that
pervaded
the
vision
taking
the
low
sunlight
on
her
face
and
smiling
as
she
stepped
through
the
window
it
was
no
small
tribute
to
the
lady
had
she
but
known
it
that
her
coming
was
not
received
nor
even
felt
as
an
as
she
came
forward
all
about
her
rose
a
significant
babel
miss
levering
vida
how
do
you
the
of
swishing
skirts
the
scrape
of
chairs
pushed
back
over
stone
flags
and
the
greeting
of
the
host
and
hostess
cordial
to
the
point
of
affection
the
various
handshakings
the
discreet
winding
through
the
groups
of
a
footman
with
a
fresh
teapot
the
bedlington
first
attack
of
barking
merged
in
upon
pleased
recognition
of
a
friend
and
a
final
settling
down
again
about
the
with
the
air
full
of
scraps
of
talk
and
unfinished
questions
did
see
anything
of
my
brother
and
his
wife
asked
lord
borrodaile
yes
his
host
suddenly
remembered
thought
the
freddys
were
coming
by
that
as
well
as
nobody
but
me
she
threw
her
boa
on
the
back
of
the
chair
that
paul
filey
had
drawn
up
for
her
between
the
hostess
and
the
place
where
borrodaile
had
been
sitting
are
two
more
good
trains
before
dinner
began
lord
john
did
i
tell
you
said
his
wife
as
she
gave
the
cup
just
filled
for
the
into
the
nearest
of
the
outstretched
hands
i
tell
you
i
had
a
note
from
freddy
by
the
afternoon
post
they
are
coming
out
of
a
little
chorus
of
regret
came
borrodaile
slightly
mocking
wrong
with
the
precious
children
did
mention
the
children
nor
much
of
anything
else
just
a
hurried
line
children
were
as
merry
as
grigs
yesterday
said
vida
looking
at
their
uncle
across
the
table
went
on
to
the
freddys
after
the
royal
academy
no
she
put
her
cup
down
suddenly
is
to
ask
me
how
i
like
my
own
picture
the
tunbridge
children
thing
hoyle
has
done
of
you
said
lord
borrodaile
deliberately
a
very
brilliant
and
a
very
misleading
performance
you
filey
and
lord
john
in
spite
of
her
interdiction
were
pursuing
the
subject
of
the
portrait
certainly
is
one
aspect
of
you
you
think
his
use
of
black
and
white
tiny
tunbridges
as
i
was
saying
she
went
on
imperturbably
having
a
teafight
when
i
got
there
i
say
fight
advisedly
i
warrant
said
their
uncle
sara
was
the
aggressor
was
saw
mrs
freddy
asked
lady
john
with
an
interest
half
amused
half
cynical
in
her
eyes
a
moment
does
confess
it
i
suppose
the
hostess
went
on
i
imagine
she
is
rather
perturbed
and
lady
john
glanced
at
borrodaile
with
her
smile
mrs
freddy
said
vida
see
she
taken
it
all
quite
seriously
this
suffrage
nonsense
freddy
had
met
lady
john
look
with
the
same
significant
smile
as
that
lady
own
she
naturally
feeling
rather
crestfallen
perhaps
she
now
freddy
crestfallen
what
about
said
farnborough
but
he
was
much
preoccupied
at
that
moment
in
supplying
lady
sophia
with
bits
of
toast
the
exact
size
for
balancing
on
the
bedlington
nose
for
the
benefit
of
his
end
of
the
table
paul
filey
had
begun
to
describe
the
new
show
of
caricatures
of
famous
people
just
opened
in
bond
street
the
genius
as
he
called
it
of
this
new
man
an
american
jew
offered
an
irresistible
opportunity
for
and
still
on
the
other
side
of
the
tea
urn
the
ullands
were
discussing
with
borrodaile
and
miss
levering
the
absent
lady
whose
was
obviously
a
matter
of
concern
to
her
friends
let
us
hope
lord
john
was
saying
as
sternly
as
his
urbanity
permitted
us
hope
this
exhibition
in
the
house
will
be
a
lesson
to
her
was
concerned
in
it
vida
quickly
defended
her
we
are
all
hoping
said
lady
john
it
has
come
just
in
time
to
prevent
her
from
going
over
the
edge
the
edge
farnborough
pricked
up
his
ears
at
last
in
good
earnest
feeling
that
the
conversation
on
the
other
side
had
grown
too
interesting
for
him
to
be
out
of
it
any
longer
what
edge
edge
of
the
woman
suffrage
precipice
said
lady
john
call
it
a
precipice
vida
levering
raised
her
dark
brows
in
a
little
smile
you
demanded
her
hostess
should
say
the
point
of
view
of
the
artist
paul
filey
had
begun
laying
down
some
new
law
but
turning
an
abrupt
corner
he
followed
the
wandering
attention
of
his
audience
the
point
of
view
of
the
artist
he
repeated
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
the
phenomenon
is
that
lady
john
took
for
a
precipice
and
that
miss
levering
says
is
a
said
lord
john
thinking
it
well
to
generalize
and
spare
freddy
further
rending
been
talking
about
this
public
demonstration
of
the
unfitness
of
women
for
public
affairs
me
some
more
toast
dice
sophia
said
to
farnborough
seen
joey
new
accomplishment
they
only
discussing
that
idiotic
scene
the
women
made
the
other
night
in
the
gallery
of
the
house
of
commons
was
it
disgustin
said
paul
filey
facing
about
suddenly
with
an
air
of
cheerful
surprise
at
having
at
last
hit
on
something
that
he
and
lady
sophia
could
heartily
agree
about
revolting
said
hermione
heriot
not
to
be
out
of
it
for
it
is
well
known
that
next
to
a
great
enthusiasm
shared
nothing
so
draws
human
creatures
together
as
a
good
bout
of
cursing
in
common
so
with
emphasis
miss
heriot
repeated
revolting
her
reward
was
to
see
paul
turn
away
from
sophia
and
say
in
a
tone
whose
fervour
might
be
called
marked
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
she
consolidated
her
position
by
asking
sweetly
it
need
saying
by
people
like
you
but
it
need
saying
when
it
comes
to
people
we
know
freddy
yes
that
unfortunate
little
lady
seemed
to
be
it
on
all
sides
even
her
who
was
known
to
be
in
reality
a
great
ally
of
hers
even
lord
borrodaile
was
chuckling
as
though
at
some
reflection
distinctly
diverting
laura
she
was
being
unmercifully
chaffed
about
it
last
night
do
myself
consider
it
any
longer
a
subject
for
chaff
said
lord
john
agreed
his
wife
felt
that
before
this
last
outbreak
at
the
time
of
the
first
disturbance
where
was
it
in
some
town
in
the
north
several
weeks
ago
said
vida
levering
almost
think
that
was
even
worse
the
sublime
impertinence
said
lady
john
an
ignorant
little
factory
girl
presuming
to
stand
up
in
public
and
interrupt
a
speech
by
a
minister
of
the
crown
do
know
what
we
coming
to
i
sure
said
borrodaile
with
a
detached
air
girl
beyond
a
doubt
said
his
host
with
conviction
girl
was
touched
beyond
a
doubt
echoed
farnborough
something
about
this
particular
form
of
feminine
folly
began
lord
john
but
he
was
listened
to
for
several
people
were
talking
at
once
after
receiving
a
few
preliminary
kicks
the
subject
had
fallen
as
a
football
might
plump
into
the
very
midst
of
a
group
of
its
sudden
presence
there
stirred
even
the
sluggish
to
unwonted
feats
every
one
must
have
his
kick
at
this
suffrage
ball
and
manners
were
for
the
nonce
in
abeyance
in
the
midst
of
an
obscuring
dust
of
discussion
floated
fragments
of
condemnation
creatures
shrieking
sisterhood
in
which
the
kindest
phrase
was
lord
john
repeated
you
know
as
he
tapped
his
forehead
really
responsible
poor
wretches
touched
everybody
does
know
that
it
must
give
men
a
quite
horrid
idea
of
women
said
hermione
delicately
lord
borrodaile
spoke
with
a
wise
forbearance
do
confound
a
handful
of
females
with
the
whole
sex
dick
farnborough
was
in
the
middle
of
a
spirited
account
of
that
earlier
outbreak
in
the
north
was
yelling
like
a
red
indian
and
the
policeman
carried
her
out
scratching
and
spitting
hermione
exchanged
looks
of
horror
with
paul
filey
yes
said
lady
john
with
disgust
saw
all
that
in
the
papers
miss
levering
too
had
turned
her
face
away
not
as
hermione
did
to
summon
a
witness
to
her
detestation
but
rather
as
one
avoiding
the
eyes
of
the
men
see
said
farnborough
with
gusto
something
about
clothes
their
hats
you
know
they
well
they
ai
built
for
battle
ought
to
wear
was
lady
sophia
contribution
to
the
new
movement
is
quite
true
lady
john
agreed
a
woman
in
a
scrimmage
can
never
be
a
heroic
figure
that
just
it
said
farnborough
just
funny
do
you
know
do
agree
with
you
about
the
fun
borrodaile
objected
why
i
glad
they
had
their
lesson
i
should
say
there
was
almost
nothing
more
degrading
than
this
public
spectacle
of
borrodaile
lifted
his
high
shoulders
higher
still
with
an
effect
of
intense
discomfort
never
but
once
came
my
way
that
i
remember
but
i
free
to
own
he
said
nothing
that
shakes
my
nerves
like
seeing
a
woman
struggling
and
kicking
in
a
policeman
arms
but
farnborough
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
from
seeing
humour
in
the
situation
say
they
swept
up
a
peck
of
hairpins
after
the
battle
as
though
she
had
had
as
much
of
the
subject
as
she
could
very
well
stand
miss
levering
leaned
sideways
put
an
arm
behind
her
and
took
possession
of
her
boa
just
ending
the
first
act
of
how
glad
i
am
to
be
in
your
garden
instead
of
covent
garden
ordinarily
there
would
have
been
a
movement
to
take
the
appreciative
guest
for
a
stroll
perhaps
it
was
only
chance
or
the
enervating
heat
that
kept
the
company
in
their
chairs
listening
to
farnborough
cattiest
one
of
the
two
there
she
stood
like
this
her
clothes
half
torn
off
her
hair
down
her
back
her
face
the
colour
of
a
lobster
and
the
crowd
jeering
at
her
do
see
how
you
could
stand
and
look
on
at
such
a
hideous
scene
said
miss
levering
i
i
did
i
only
telling
you
how
wilkinson
described
it
he
said
did
major
wilkinson
happen
to
be
there
asked
lady
john
motored
over
from
headquarters
to
move
a
vote
of
thanks
to
the
chairman
he
said
he
seen
some
revolting
things
in
his
time
but
the
scrimmage
of
the
stewards
and
the
police
with
those
women
farnborough
ended
with
an
expressive
gesture
it
was
as
horrible
as
that
for
major
wilkinson
to
look
on
at
what
must
it
have
been
for
those
girls
it
was
miss
levering
speaking
she
seemed
to
have
abandoned
the
hope
of
being
taken
for
a
stroll
and
was
leaning
forward
chin
in
hand
looking
at
the
fringe
of
the
teacloth
richard
farnborough
glanced
at
her
as
if
he
resented
the
note
of
wondering
pity
in
the
low
tone
never
so
bad
for
the
lunatic
he
said
for
the
sane
people
looking
on
i
do
suppose
mind
said
hermione
like
flattery
to
call
them
women
they
sexless
monstrosities
said
paul
filey
know
some
of
them
vida
raised
her
head
filey
face
was
nothing
less
than
aghast
at
the
mere
suggestion
you
seen
them
forbid
i
suppose
you
gone
and
listened
to
them
haranguing
the
crowds
i
look
like
a
person
who
you
see
we
all
so
certain
they
such
abominations
said
vida
thought
maybe
some
of
us
knew
something
about
them
dick
farnborough
was
heard
saying
to
lord
john
in
a
tone
of
cheerful
vigour
up
is
too
good
for
i
give
a
good
thrashin
fellow
said
miss
levering
promptly
with
an
accent
that
brought
down
a
laugh
on
the
young
gentleman
head
he
joined
in
it
but
with
a
uneasiness
what
the
matter
with
the
woman
his
vaguely
bewildered
face
seemed
to
inquire
after
all
i
only
agreeing
with
her
of
us
have
time
i
imagine
said
filey
go
and
listen
to
their
ravings
as
filey
was
quite
the
idlest
of
men
without
the
preoccupation
of
being
a
tolerable
sportsman
or
even
a
player
of
games
miss
levering
little
laugh
was
echoed
by
others
beside
lady
sophia
all
events
said
vida
to
lord
borrodaile
as
she
stood
up
and
he
drew
her
chair
out
of
her
way
if
we
do
know
much
about
these
women
we
spent
a
happy
hour
denouncing
them
going
to
have
a
short
round
before
sundown
said
lady
sophia
getting
up
briskly
of
course
filey
or
are
you
too
busy
too
thirsty
may
i
he
carried
his
cup
round
to
lady
john
not
seeming
to
see
hermione
hospitable
hand
held
out
for
it
in
the
general
shuffle
farnborough
found
himself
carried
off
by
sophia
and
lord
john
is
our
fourth
said
lady
sophia
suddenly
borrodaile
lord
john
stopped
halfway
across
the
lawn
and
called
back
you
coming
not
a
bit
of
use
said
sophia
see
he
safe
to
sit
there
and
talk
to
miss
levering
till
the
rings
she
a
creature
said
lord
john
ca
think
how
a
woman
like
that
has
got
some
nice
fella
to
marry
her
you
like
to
see
my
yellow
garden
vida
lady
john
asked
rather
glorious
at
this
moment
obvious
from
the
quick
lifting
of
the
eyes
that
the
guest
was
on
the
point
of
welcoming
the
proposal
had
filey
not
swallowed
his
belated
cup
of
tea
with
surprising
quickness
after
saying
a
yellow
garden
in
the
unmistakable
tone
of
one
bent
upon
enlarging
his
experience
lady
john
with
all
her
antennÃ¦
out
lost
no
time
in
saying
to
vida
you
a
little
tired
hermione
you
show
filey
the
garden
and
maybe
lord
borrodaile
would
like
to
see
it
too
although
the
failed
to
share
the
enthusiasm
expected
in
a
gardener
he
pulled
his
long
figure
out
of
the
chair
and
joined
the
young
people
when
they
were
out
of
earshot
the
matter
asked
lady
john
what
did
poor
paul
say
to
make
you
fall
upon
him
like
that
did
fall
upon
him
did
i
yes
i
rather
thought
you
did
i
suppose
i
perhaps
it
did
jar
on
me
just
a
little
to
hear
a
cocksure
boy
not
a
boy
paul
is
over
thirty
was
thinking
of
dick
farnborough
too
talking
about
women
like
that
before
women
all
they
meant
was
i
know
of
course
we
know
they
are
accustomed
to
treating
our
sex
in
general
with
overmuch
respect
when
there
are
only
men
present
but
do
you
think
it
quite
decent
that
they
should
be
so
free
with
their
contempt
of
women
before
us
my
dear
vida
sort
of
woman
have
they
deserved
it
just
what
nobody
seems
to
know
i
sat
and
listened
to
conversations
like
the
one
at
tea
for
a
week
now
and
i
said
as
much
against
those
women
as
anybody
only
somehow
when
i
heard
that
boy
yes
i
was
conscious
i
did
like
it
behaving
exactly
as
johnson
did
about
garrick
you
allow
any
one
to
abuse
those
women
but
yourself
lady
john
cleared
the
whole
trivial
business
away
with
a
laugh
be
nice
to
paul
he
dying
to
talk
to
you
about
his
book
let
us
go
and
join
them
in
the
garden
see
if
you
can
stand
before
my
yellow
blaze
and
not
feel
melted
the
elder
woman
and
the
younger
went
down
the
terrace
through
a
little
copse
to
her
ladyship
own
area
of
experimentation
a
gate
of
old
florentine
scrolled
iron
opened
suddenly
upon
a
blaze
of
yellow
in
all
the
shades
from
the
orange
velvet
of
the
wallflower
through
the
shaded
saffron
of
azalias
and
a
dozen
tints
of
tulip
to
the
palest
primrose
and
jonquil
the
others
were
walking
round
the
enclosing
grass
paths
that
served
as
broad
green
border
and
filey
who
had
been
in
all
sorts
of
queer
places
said
the
yellow
garden
made
him
think
of
a
mexican
serapÃ©
of
those
silk
scarves
you
know
native
weaving
made
out
of
the
pineapple
fibre
but
vida
only
said
it
a
good
scheme
of
colour
she
sat
on
the
rustic
seat
while
lady
john
explained
to
lord
borrodaile
whose
gardens
were
renowned
how
she
and
simonson
treated
this
and
that
plant
to
get
so
fine
a
result
filey
had
lost
no
time
in
finding
a
place
for
himself
by
miss
levering
while
hermione
trailed
dutifully
round
the
garden
with
the
others
occasionally
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
the
two
on
the
seat
by
the
sunken
wall
vida
leaning
back
in
the
corner
motionless
absolutely
inexpressive
filey
eager
face
bent
forward
he
was
moving
his
hands
in
a
way
he
had
learned
abroad
were
rather
annoyed
with
me
he
was
saying
saw
that
the
lady
did
not
deny
the
imputation
you
ought
to
be
because
you
see
it
only
because
my
ideal
of
woman
is
again
that
motion
of
the
hands
it
is
that
when
i
see
her
stepping
down
from
her
pedestal
i
the
hands
indicated
consternation
followed
hard
by
cataclysmic
ruin
course
lots
of
men
do
care
i
i
care
enormously
and
so
you
must
forgive
me
wo
you
he
bent
nearer
nothing
to
forgive
know
without
your
telling
me
i
feel
instinctively
more
than
most
people
you
simply
loathe
the
sort
of
thing
we
were
talking
about
at
tea
women
yelling
and
fighting
men
yes
do
go
all
over
that
of
course
i
wo
he
said
soothingly
can
feel
it
to
my
very
spine
how
you
shrink
from
such
horrors
miss
levering
raising
her
eyes
suddenly
caught
the
look
hermione
cast
backward
as
lady
john
halted
her
party
a
moment
near
the
in
the
gorgeous
yellow
carpet
spread
out
before
them
you
want
to
sit
down
vida
called
out
to
the
girl
drawing
aside
her
gown
said
hermione
though
she
had
heard
quite
well
slowly
she
retraced
her
steps
down
the
grass
path
as
if
to
have
the
words
repeated
but
if
miss
levering
idea
had
been
to
change
the
conversation
she
was
disappointed
there
was
nothing
paul
filey
liked
better
than
an
audience
and
he
had
already
the
impression
that
miss
heriot
was
what
he
would
have
scorned
to
call
anything
but
sure
you
shown
the
new
garden
to
dozens
already
miss
levering
said
to
the
niece
of
the
house
down
and
confess
you
had
enough
of
it
i
do
think
began
hermione
suavely
one
ever
gets
too
much
of
a
thing
like
that
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
how
can
we
have
too
much
beauty
exclaimed
filey
receiving
the
new
occupant
of
the
seat
as
a
soul
worthy
of
high
fellowship
then
he
leaned
across
miss
heriot
and
said
to
the
lady
in
the
corner
making
that
the
theme
of
my
book
i
heard
you
were
writing
something
a
sort
of
plea
for
the
Ã¦sthetic
basis
of
society
it
the
only
cure
for
the
horrors
of
modern
civilization
for
the
very
thing
we
were
talking
about
at
tea
what
is
it
but
a
loss
of
the
sense
of
beauty
that
to
blame
elbows
on
knees
he
leaned
so
far
forward
that
he
could
see
both
faces
and
yet
his
own
betrayed
the
eye
turned
inward
the
face
of
the
one
who
quotes
the
ladies
knew
that
he
was
obliging
them
with
a
memorized
extract
from
plea
for
the
Ã¦sthetic
basis
worse
can
happen
to
the
world
than
loss
of
its
sense
of
beauty
men
high
and
low
alike
cling
to
it
still
as
incarnated
in
women
hermione
crossed
her
pointed
toes
and
lowered
her
long
eyelashes
have
made
woman
the
object
of
our
deepest
adoration
we
have
set
her
high
on
a
throne
of
gold
we
have
searched
through
the
world
for
jewels
to
crown
her
we
have
built
millions
of
temples
to
our
ideal
of
womanhood
and
called
them
homes
we
have
fought
and
wrought
and
sung
for
her
and
all
we
ask
in
return
is
that
she
should
tend
the
sacred
fire
so
that
the
light
of
beauty
might
not
die
out
of
the
world
he
was
not
with
his
period
women
he
leaned
back
and
illustrated
with
the
pliant
white
hands
that
were
ornamented
with
outlandish
rings
are
not
content
with
their
high
and
holy
office
women
amended
hermione
softly
are
more
and
more
every
day
who
are
not
content
he
said
sternly
then
for
an
instant
unbending
and
craning
a
little
forward
course
i
do
mean
you
are
exceptions
but
of
women
in
the
mass
look
at
them
they
force
their
way
into
men
work
they
crowd
into
the
universities
yes
yes
in
vain
hermione
tried
to
reassure
him
by
is
nothing
to
them
they
fling
aside
their
delicate
provocative
draperies
they
cast
off
their
scented
sandals
they
pull
on
brown
boots
and
bicycling
skirts
they
put
man
yoke
of
hard
linen
round
their
ivory
throats
and
they
scramble
off
their
jewelled
thrones
to
mount
the
rostrum
and
the
omnibus
do
they
vida
demanded
laughing
ever
tells
me
why
i
ca
believe
they
as
unselfish
as
make
out
ought
to
admire
them
if
they
voluntarily
give
up
all
those
beautiful
things
knowing
beforehand
they
only
win
men
scorn
for
you
always
warned
them
he
did
even
hear
ladies
ladies
half
laughing
but
really
very
much
in
earnest
he
apostrophized
the
peccant
sex
should
like
to
ask
are
we
men
to
look
upon
our
homes
as
dusty
camps
on
the
field
of
battle
or
as
holy
temples
of
peace
ah
he
leaned
back
in
his
corner
stretched
out
his
long
legs
and
thrust
his
restless
hands
in
his
pockets
they
knew
asked
hermione
with
the
air
of
one
painstakingly
brushing
up
crumbs
of
wisdom
paul
filey
nodded
would
see
that
in
the
ugly
scramble
they
had
let
fall
their
crowns
if
they
only
knew
he
repeated
would
go
back
to
their
thrones
and
with
the
sceptre
of
beauty
in
one
hand
and
the
orb
of
purity
in
the
other
they
would
teach
men
to
worship
them
again
then
said
miss
levering
why
men
will
fall
on
their
knees
before
them
as
miss
levering
made
no
rejoinder
greater
victory
do
women
want
he
demanded
for
the
first
time
miss
levering
bent
her
head
forward
slightly
as
though
to
see
how
far
he
was
conscious
of
the
fatuity
of
his
climax
but
his
flushed
face
showed
a
childlike
good
faith
will
any
one
tell
me
what
they
you
need
to
ask
said
the
gently
smiling
woman
in
the
corner
there
more
need
to
show
than
i
quite
realized
do
think
you
quite
followed
he
began
with
an
air
of
forbearance
i
mean
is
miss
levering
jumped
up
borrodaile
he
was
standing
at
the
little
iron
gate
waiting
for
his
hostess
who
had
stopped
to
speak
to
one
of
the
gardeners
a
moment
vida
called
and
went
swiftly
down
the
grass
path
he
had
turned
and
was
advancing
to
meet
her
come
away
she
said
under
her
breath
away
quickly
safe
on
the
other
side
of
the
gate
talk
to
me
tell
me
about
old
pictures
or
about
young
rose
trees
something
the
matter
ruffled
has
ruffled
you
his
tone
was
as
serene
as
it
was
sympathetic
people
i
thought
you
were
never
ruffled
not
often
they
turned
down
into
a
little
green
aisle
between
two
dense
thickets
of
rhododendrons
lucky
you
are
here
she
said
irrelevantly
he
glanced
at
her
face
not
luck
it
foresight
you
arranged
it
well
i
glad
am
i
he
answered
quietly
get
on
rather
well
together
he
added
after
a
moment
she
nodded
half
absently
feel
as
if
i
known
you
for
years
instead
of
for
months
she
said
i
have
rather
that
feeling
too
except
that
i
always
a
little
nervous
when
i
meet
you
again
after
an
interval
she
frowned
nervous
always
afraid
you
have
some
news
for
me
news
the
usual
thing
that
a
pleasant
friendship
is
going
to
be
interrupted
if
not
broken
by
some
one
carrying
you
off
it
would
be
a
pity
you
know
you
do
agree
with
lord
john
i
suppose
you
to
marry
he
said
with
smiling
impatience
i
very
sure
you
will
but
i
sha
like
it
he
wound
up
with
an
odd
little
laugh
neither
will
you
an
experiment
i
shall
never
try
he
smiled
but
as
he
glanced
at
her
he
grew
grave
heard
more
than
one
young
woman
say
that
but
you
look
as
if
it
might
really
be
so
is
so
he
waited
and
then
switching
at
the
wild
hyacinths
with
his
stick
course
he
said
have
no
right
to
suppose
you
are
going
to
give
me
your
reasons
that
why
i
shall
never
even
consider
marrying
so
that
i
shall
not
have
to
set
out
my
reasons
he
had
never
seen
that
look
in
her
face
before
he
made
an
effort
to
put
aside
the
trouble
of
it
saying
almost
lightly
often
wonder
why
people
ca
be
happy
as
they
are
think
of
the
future
i
suppose
no
such
thing
as
the
future
ca
say
there
no
such
thing
as
growth
if
it
only
a
garden
it
natural
to
like
to
see
life
unfolding
that
the
future
in
spite
of
resolutions
you
be
trying
the
great
experiment
he
said
it
wearily
should
you
mind
so
she
asked
curiously
are
not
in
love
with
me
do
you
know
you
give
me
such
a
sense
of
rest
you
he
caught
himself
up
perhaps
i
should
thank
my
grey
hair
hair
does
bring
the
thing
i
mean
i
sometimes
wished
it
did
but
our
friendship
is
an
uncommonly
peaceful
one
do
you
think
i
think
it
is
he
said
the
same
you
know
there
a
touch
of
magic
in
it
but
as
though
to
condone
the
confession
told
me
why
you
were
ruffled
nothing
i
dare
say
i
was
a
little
tired
they
had
come
out
into
the
park
hurried
so
to
catch
the
train
my
sister
new
coachman
is
stupid
about
finding
short
cuts
in
london
and
we
got
blocked
by
a
procession
a
horrible
sort
of
demonstration
you
know
the
unemployed
and
i
got
so
tired
of
leaning
out
of
the
window
and
shouting
directions
that
i
left
the
maid
and
the
luggage
to
come
later
i
got
out
of
the
brougham
and
ran
through
a
slum
or
i
have
lost
my
train
i
nearly
lost
it
anyway
because
i
saw
a
queer
picture
that
made
me
stop
she
stopped
again
at
the
mere
memory
of
it
a
shop
he
turned
his
pointed
face
to
her
and
the
eyes
wore
a
gleam
of
interest
that
few
things
could
arouse
in
their
cool
depths
not
in
a
shop
she
stopped
and
leaned
against
a
tree
the
street
it
was
a
workman
when
i
caught
sight
of
his
back
and
saw
his
worn
clothes
the
coat
went
up
in
the
middle
and
had
that
despairing
sag
on
both
sides
it
crossed
my
mind
here
another
of
those
miserable
unemployed
wastrels
obstructing
my
way
then
he
looked
round
and
i
saw
solid
content
in
his
face
she
stopped
a
moment
he
one
of
the
i
wondered
i
could
see
at
first
what
it
was
he
had
looked
round
at
then
i
noticed
he
had
a
rope
in
his
hand
and
was
dragging
something
as
the
people
who
had
been
between
us
hurried
on
i
saw
i
saw
a
child
two
or
three
years
old
in
a
flapping
pink
he
was
sitting
astride
a
toy
horse
the
horse
was
clumsily
made
and
had
lost
its
tail
but
it
had
its
head
still
and
the
board
it
was
mounted
on
had
fat
wooden
rollers
the
horse
was
only
about
that
long
and
so
near
the
ground
that
for
all
his
advantage
in
the
matter
of
rollers
still
the
little
rider
feet
touched
the
pavement
they
even
trailed
and
lurched
as
the
horse
went
on
in
that
funny
spasmodic
gait
the
child
had
to
half
walk
or
rather
make
the
motions
you
know
without
actually
bearing
any
of
even
his
own
weight
the
man
did
it
all
i
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
stood
and
watched
them
till
as
i
say
i
nearly
lost
my
train
the
dingy
workman
smoking
imperturbably
dragging
the
grotesque
almost
hidden
horse
the
delighted
child
in
the
flapping
the
crisis
when
they
came
to
the
crossing
the
man
turned
and
called
out
something
the
child
declined
to
budge
i
wondered
what
would
happen
so
did
the
man
he
waited
a
moment
and
puffed
smoke
and
considered
the
baby
dug
his
heels
in
the
pavement
and
shouted
then
i
saw
the
man
carefully
tilt
the
toy
horse
up
by
the
rope
i
stood
and
watched
the
successful
surmounting
of
the
obstacle
and
the
triumphant
progress
as
before
flapping
smoke
curling
of
course
the
man
was
content
he
had
lost
the
battle
you
saw
that
in
his
lined
face
what
did
it
matter
held
the
future
by
a
lord
borrodaile
lifted
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
without
a
word
the
two
walked
on
the
first
to
speak
after
the
silence
was
the
man
he
pointed
out
a
curious
effect
of
the
light
and
reminded
her
who
had
painted
it
best
could
do
these
things
and
he
flung
a
stone
in
passing
at
the
new
impressionists
at
the
lodge
gate
they
found
lady
john
with
filey
and
hermione
thought
if
we
walked
this
way
we
might
meet
jean
and
her
bodyguard
but
i
must
go
any
further
lady
john
consulted
her
watch
rest
of
you
can
take
your
time
but
i
have
to
go
and
receive
my
other
guest
filey
and
hermione
were
still
at
the
gate
the
girl
had
caught
sight
of
farnborough
being
driven
by
the
park
road
to
the
station
i
do
believe
it
the
new
mare
they
trying
in
the
dogcart
said
hermione
wait
and
see
her
go
by
borrodaile
and
his
companion
kept
at
lady
john
side
glad
said
vida
i
shall
at
last
make
acquaintance
with
your
jean
it
odd
your
never
having
met
especially
as
she
knows
your
cousins
at
bishopsmead
so
well
been
so
little
in
england
i
know
a
great
business
it
is
lady
john
explained
to
lord
borrodaile
time
to
get
that
crusty
old
covenanter
grandfather
to
allow
her
to
stay
at
bishopsmead
so
it
the
sadder
for
them
to
have
her
visit
cut
short
is
it
cut
short
he
asked
the
hostess
took
to
her
bed
yesterday
with
a
chill
and
her
temperature
was
a
hundred
and
one
this
afternoon
said
miss
levering
had
heard
is
rather
bad
i
afraid
we
are
taking
over
another
of
her
guests
of
course
you
know
him
geoffrey
stonor
him
over
miss
levering
repeated
he
was
originally
going
to
bishopsmead
this
but
as
been
promising
for
ages
to
come
here
it
been
arranged
that
we
should
take
him
off
their
hands
of
course
we
delighted
miss
levering
walked
on
between
her
two
companions
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
as
lady
john
with
a
glance
at
her
watch
quickened
the
pace
rather
unhappy
at
what
you
tell
me
about
my
cousin
said
vida
a
delicate
creature
then
as
though
acting
on
a
sudden
impulse
vida
paused
must
mind
lady
john
but
i
shall
have
to
go
to
her
can
i
have
a
trap
of
some
sort
to
take
me
over
she
put
aside
the
objections
with
a
gentle
but
unmistakable
decision
that
made
lady
john
say
sure
i
alarmed
you
more
than
there
was
the
least
need
for
but
the
carriage
shall
wait
and
bring
you
back
just
as
soon
as
satisfied
yourself
ca
tell
of
course
till
i
seen
mary
but
may
my
maid
be
told
not
to
unpack
unpack
case
i
have
to
send
for
my
things
lady
john
stopped
short
for
very
vexation
desert
us
i
been
so
congratulating
myself
on
having
you
since
i
knew
geoffrey
stonor
was
coming
again
she
glanced
nervously
at
her
watch
is
due
in
ten
minutes
john
wo
like
it
if
i
not
there
as
she
was
about
to
hurry
on
the
other
slackened
pace
she
seemed
to
be
revolving
some
further
plan
should
she
turned
suddenly
should
the
dogcart
take
me
on
after
dropping
farnborough
at
the
station
yes
that
will
be
simplest
mr
farnborough
she
waved
to
him
as
the
cart
came
in
sight
forgive
my
rushing
off
wo
you
she
called
back
over
her
shoulder
and
then
with
that
swift
light
step
of
hers
she
covered
by
a
short
cut
the
little
distance
that
lay
between
her
and
the
lodge
gate
wish
i
held
my
tongue
said
lady
john
almost
angrily
as
she
hastened
in
the
opposite
direction
already
some
sense
seemed
to
reach
her
of
the
hopelessness
of
expecting
vida
return
did
she
cared
so
much
for
that
dull
cousin
of
hers
you
think
she
really
does
said
borrodaile
dryly
chapter
vii
about
vida
little
enterprise
on
a
certain
sunday
a
few
weeks
later
was
an
air
of
elaborate
mystery
yet
the
expedition
was
no
further
than
to
trafalgar
square
it
was
there
that
those
women
the
in
the
intervals
of
making
worse
public
disturbances
were
rumoured
to
be
holding
meetings
a
circumstance
distinctly
fortunate
for
any
one
who
wanted
to
what
they
were
like
and
who
was
yet
unwilling
to
commit
herself
by
doing
anything
so
eccentric
as
publicly
to
seek
admission
under
any
roof
known
to
show
hospitality
to
goings
on
in
those
days
only
a
year
ago
and
yet
already
such
ancient
history
that
the
earlier
pages
are
forgotten
and
scarce
credible
if
recalled
it
took
courage
to
walk
past
the
knots
of
facetious
loafers
and
the
unblushing
suffragette
poster
into
the
hall
where
the
meetings
were
held
deliberately
to
sit
down
among
odd
misguided
persons
in
rows
to
listen
to
and
by
so
much
to
lend
public
countenance
to
of
that
sort
the
sort
that
not
only
wanted
to
vote
quaint
creatures
but
were
not
content
with
merely
wanting
to
for
the
average
conventional
woman
to
venture
upon
a
step
so
compromising
to
risk
seeming
for
a
moment
to
take
these
crazy
brawlers
seriously
was
to
lay
herself
open
to
comic
laugh
most
dreaded
of
all
the
weapons
in
the
social
armoury
but
it
was
something
wholly
different
to
set
out
for
a
sunday
afternoon
concert
or
upon
some
normal
and
recognized
philanthropic
errand
and
on
the
way
find
one
self
arrested
for
a
few
minutes
by
seeing
a
crowd
gathered
in
a
public
square
yet
it
had
not
been
easy
to
screw
up
to
thinking
even
this
measure
a
possible
one
to
pursue
would
anybody
think
she
had
asked
vida
see
them
lending
even
the
casual
support
of
a
presence
however
ironic
to
so
reprehensible
a
spectacle
had
it
not
been
for
very
faith
in
the
eccentricity
of
the
proceeding
one
wildly
unlikely
to
be
adopted
felt
by
any
one
else
of
kind
she
would
never
have
consented
to
be
drawn
into
vida
absurd
project
of
course
it
was
absolutely
essential
to
disguise
the
object
of
the
outing
from
not
merely
because
with
the
full
weight
of
his
authority
he
would
most
assuredly
have
forbidden
it
but
because
of
a
nervous
prefiguring
on
his
wife
part
of
the
particular
things
he
would
say
and
the
particular
way
he
would
look
in
setting
his
extinguisher
on
the
enterprise
vida
from
the
first
had
never
explained
or
excused
herself
to
him
so
that
when
he
asked
at
luncheon
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
this
fine
sunday
afternoon
she
had
simply
smiled
and
said
i
have
a
tryst
to
keep
it
was
her
sister
who
added
anxiously
wood
leading
now
at
the
queen
hall
concerts
and
so
without
actually
committing
herself
to
a
lie
gave
the
impression
that
music
was
to
be
their
quest
an
hour
later
while
the
old
man
was
nursing
his
gout
by
the
library
window
he
saw
the
ladies
getting
into
a
hansom
in
spite
of
the
inconvenience
to
his
afflicted
member
he
got
up
and
opened
the
window
tell
me
you
doing
anything
so
rational
you
two
as
going
to
a
concert
do
you
say
that
you
know
i
never
like
to
take
the
horses
out
on
sunday
you
think
a
dashing
irresponsible
hansom
is
more
in
keeping
with
the
factory
girls
club
or
some
giddy
whitechapel
frivolity
gave
her
sister
a
look
of
miserable
apprehension
but
the
younger
woman
laughed
and
waved
a
hand
she
knew
that
even
more
than
the
hansom
their
up
had
given
them
away
it
must
be
confessed
she
had
felt
quite
as
strongly
as
her
sister
that
it
would
do
to
be
recognized
at
a
suffragette
meeting
even
as
a
nameless
standing
out
from
a
mob
of
the
dowdy
and
the
dirty
to
be
stared
at
by
eyes
however
undiscerning
under
circumstances
so
questionable
would
be
distinctly
distasteful
so
reversing
the
order
of
nature
the
butterfly
had
retired
into
a
state
in
other
words
vida
had
put
on
the
plainest
of
her
discarded
from
a
small
tuscan
straw
the
new
maid
greatly
wondering
at
such
instructions
had
extracted
an
old
paste
buckle
and
some
violets
leaving
it
fit
to
be
seen
in
spite
of
having
herself
taken
these
precautions
vida
had
broken
into
uncontrollable
smiles
at
the
apparition
of
asking
with
pride
i
do
i
look
quite
like
a
woman
of
the
people
do
i
the
unconscious
humour
of
the
manifestation
filled
miss
levering
with
an
uneasy
merriment
every
time
she
turned
her
eyes
that
way
little
as
thought
of
his
wife
taste
either
in
clothes
or
in
amusements
he
would
have
been
more
mystified
than
ever
he
had
been
in
his
life
had
he
seen
her
hansom
ten
minutes
later
stop
on
the
north
side
of
trafalgar
square
opposite
the
national
gallery
out
and
see
she
said
retiring
guiltily
into
the
corner
of
the
conveyance
they
there
and
it
was
plain
that
nothing
could
more
have
relieved
at
that
moment
than
to
hear
were
not
but
vida
glancing
discreetly
out
of
the
side
window
had
said
i
should
think
they
are
and
a
crowd
round
them
already
look
at
their
banners
and
she
laughed
as
she
leaned
out
and
read
the
legend
demand
votes
for
women
inscribed
in
black
letters
on
the
white
ground
of
two
pieces
of
sheeting
stretched
each
between
a
pair
of
upright
poles
standing
one
on
either
side
of
the
plinth
of
column
in
the
very
middle
and
similarly
supported
was
a
banner
of
blood
red
upon
this
one
in
great
white
letters
appeared
the
legend
the
enemy
of
women
and
the
workers
as
vida
read
it
out
ejaculated
her
sister
have
really
got
that
on
a
banner
and
so
intrigued
was
she
that
like
some
shy
creature
dwelling
in
a
shell
cautiously
she
protruded
her
head
out
of
the
shiny
black
sheath
of
the
hansom
but
as
she
did
so
she
met
the
innocent
eye
of
a
tired
of
craning
his
neck
to
look
back
at
the
meeting
with
precipitation
withdrew
into
the
innermost
recesses
of
the
black
shell
janet
said
vida
who
had
meanwhile
jumped
out
and
settled
the
fare
that
man
know
us
asked
the
other
lifting
up
the
flap
from
the
back
window
of
the
hansom
and
peering
out
i
do
think
so
stared
vida
he
certainly
stared
very
hard
still
she
hesitated
clinging
to
the
friendly
shelter
of
the
hansom
come
on
he
only
stared
because
he
took
you
for
a
suffragette
but
the
indiscretion
lit
so
angry
a
light
in
the
lady
eye
that
vida
was
fain
to
add
no
do
come
and
i
tell
you
what
he
was
really
looking
at
said
putting
out
her
head
again
was
struck
said
vida
biting
her
lip
to
repress
smiles
the
hat
of
the
woman
of
the
people
but
the
lady
was
too
entirely
satisfied
with
her
hat
to
mind
poking
fun
at
it
effingham
the
enemy
read
for
herself
as
they
approached
the
flaunting
red
banner
perfectly
outrageous
perfectly
amended
the
other
one
thinks
of
that
kind
and
charming
pillar
of
excellence
told
you
they
were
mad
as
well
as
bad
know
and
now
we
going
to
watch
them
prove
it
come
on
they
stopped
the
fountains
spoke
as
though
detecting
an
additional
proof
of
turpitude
two
policemen
she
went
on
in
a
whisper
are
they
looking
at
like
that
vida
glanced
at
the
men
their
eyes
were
certainly
fixed
on
the
two
ladies
in
a
curious
direct
fashion
not
exactly
impudent
but
still
in
a
way
no
policeman
had
ever
looked
at
either
of
them
before
a
coolly
watchful
slightly
contemptuous
stare
interrupted
by
one
man
turning
to
say
something
to
the
other
at
which
both
grinned
vida
was
conscious
of
wishing
that
she
had
come
in
her
usual
clothes
above
all
that
janet
had
not
raked
out
that
sale
object
she
had
perched
on
her
head
the
wearer
of
the
incriminatory
hat
acting
upon
some
quite
unanalyzed
instinct
to
range
herself
unmistakably
on
the
side
of
law
and
order
paused
as
they
were
passing
the
two
policemen
and
addressed
them
with
dignity
it
safe
to
stop
and
listen
for
a
few
minutes
to
these
people
the
men
looked
at
with
obvious
suspicion
caw
say
said
the
one
nearest
you
expect
any
trouble
she
demanded
there
was
a
silence
and
then
the
other
policeman
said
with
a
decidedly
snubby
air
ai
our
business
to
go
fur
trouble
and
he
turned
his
eyes
away
course
not
said
vida
pleasantly
coming
to
her
sister
rescue
this
lady
wants
to
be
assured
of
is
that
there
are
enough
of
you
present
to
make
it
safe
ladies
wants
to
be
safe
said
number
one
better
stop
in
their
the
first
rude
policeman
i
ever
began
as
they
went
on
you
know
he
only
echoing
what
we
all
say
vida
was
looking
over
the
crowd
to
where
on
the
plinth
of
the
historic
column
the
little
group
of
women
and
a
solitary
man
stood
out
against
the
background
of
the
banners
here
they
were
these
new
furies
that
pursued
the
agreeable
men
one
sat
by
at
dinner
men
who
it
was
well
known
devoted
their
lives
when
they
were
dining
to
the
welfare
of
england
but
were
these
frail
rather
women
were
they
indeed
the
ones
outrageously
daring
who
broke
up
meetings
and
bashed
in
policemen
helmets
nothing
very
daring
in
their
aspect
a
little
weary
and
preoccupied
they
looked
as
they
stood
up
there
in
twos
and
threes
talking
to
one
another
in
that
exposed
position
of
theirs
while
from
time
to
time
about
their
ears
like
spent
bullets
flew
the
spasmodic
laughter
and
rude
comment
of
the
crowd
strangely
unconscious
those
of
the
thousand
eyes
and
the
sea
of
upturned
faces
what
i
expected
said
with
an
unmistakable
accent
of
disappointment
it
was
plainly
her
meaning
that
to
a
general
reprehensibleness
dulness
was
now
superadded
these
are
not
the
ones
said
vida
catching
at
hope
took
heart
we
find
out
she
suggested
they
had
penetrated
the
fringe
of
a
gathering
composed
largely
of
weedy
youths
and
wastrel
old
men
a
few
there
were
who
looked
like
decent
artizans
but
more
who
bore
the
unmistakable
aspect
of
the
beery
among
the
strangely
few
women
were
two
or
three
girls
of
the
domestic
servant
or
strand
restaurant
cashier
class
wearers
of
the
cheap
lace
blouse
and
the
wax
bead
necklace
forgetting
some
of
her
reluctance
now
that
she
was
on
the
spot
valiantly
followed
vida
as
the
younger
woman
threaded
her
way
among
the
constantly
increasing
crowd
just
in
front
of
where
the
two
came
to
a
final
standstill
was
a
old
man
with
a
lot
of
unsold
sunday
papers
under
one
arm
and
wearing
like
an
apron
the
bill
of
the
many
of
the
boys
and
young
men
were
smoking
cigarettes
some
of
the
older
men
had
pipes
commented
on
the
inferior
taste
in
tobacco
as
shown
by
the
lower
orders
but
she
too
kept
her
eyes
glued
to
the
figures
up
there
on
the
plinth
had
to
get
men
to
hold
up
their
banners
for
them
laughed
vida
as
though
she
saw
a
symbolism
in
the
fact
further
convicting
these
women
of
folly
there
a
man
that
one
who
is
holding
up
anything
that
i
can
see
what
on
earth
is
doing
there
he
be
upholding
something
later
to
speak
you
mean
may
be
a
debate
perhaps
he
going
to
present
the
other
side
if
he
does
i
hope
he
tell
them
plainly
what
he
thinks
of
them
she
said
it
quite
distinctly
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
round
her
both
ladies
were
still
obviously
occupied
with
the
need
to
look
completely
detached
to
advertise
not
one
of
them
never
think
it
but
it
was
gradually
being
borne
in
upon
them
that
they
need
take
no
further
trouble
in
this
connection
nobody
in
the
crowd
noticed
any
one
except
ordinary
looking
persons
as
complainingly
called
them
up
there
on
the
plinth
like
what
one
sees
on
the
tops
of
omnibuses
certainly
it
was
an
exercise
in
incongruity
to
compare
these
quiet
rather
depressed
looking
people
with
the
vision
conjured
up
by
lord
john
lunatics
of
the
straight
jacket
or
paul
filey
monstrosities
rather
like
a
jest
that
promised
very
well
at
the
beginning
only
the
teller
has
forgotten
the
point
or
else
vida
added
looking
at
the
face
of
one
of
the
women
up
there
else
the
mistake
was
in
thinking
it
a
jest
at
all
she
turned
away
impatiently
and
devoted
her
attention
to
such
scraps
of
comment
as
she
could
overhear
in
the
crowd
or
such
rather
as
she
could
understand
one
that
just
come
yes
in
the
blue
that
the
one
i
was
tellin
you
about
said
a
man
with
a
cheerful
and
rubicund
face
like
she
be
with
her
fists
do
she
contributed
a
friend
alongside
the
boys
in
front
and
behind
laughed
appreciatively
but
the
ruddy
man
said
no
the
one
wot
carries
the
and
they
all
craned
forward
with
redoubled
interest
it
is
sad
to
be
obliged
to
admit
that
the
two
ladies
did
precisely
the
same
while
the
boys
were
in
addition
and
inquiring
about
the
must
be
the
woman
the
papers
have
been
full
of
whispered
staring
at
the
with
horrified
eyes
no
doubt
vida
too
scrutinized
her
more
narrowly
the
wearer
of
the
was
certainly
more
than
the
others
but
even
she
had
the
pallor
of
the
worker
in
the
town
she
carried
her
fine
head
and
shoulders
badly
like
one
who
has
stooped
over
tasks
at
an
age
when
she
should
have
been
running
about
the
fields
she
drew
her
thick
brows
together
every
now
and
then
with
an
effect
of
determination
that
gave
her
features
so
dark
and
forbidding
an
aspect
it
was
a
surprise
to
see
the
grace
that
swept
into
her
face
when
at
something
one
of
her
comrades
said
she
broke
into
a
smile
two
shabby
men
on
vida
left
were
working
themselves
into
a
fine
state
of
moral
indignation
over
the
laxity
of
the
police
in
allowing
these
women
to
air
their
vanity
in
public
here
with
to
tell
us
to
do
our
business
part
o
wot
i
mean

his
companion

a
woman
of
forty
or
so
that
miss
chipped
in
a
young
man
of
respectable
appearance
just
behind
why
that
the
mother

and
there
was
a
little
ripple
of
laughter
she
got
any
of
her
jewels
along
with
her
said
another
voice
do
they
mean
demanded
vida
shook
her
head
she
herself
was
looking
about
for
some
one
to
ask
it
queer
that
you
and
i
have
lived
all
this
time
in
the
world
and
have
never
yet
been
in
a
mixed
crowd
before
in
all
our
lives
never
a
part
of
think
myself
it
less
strange
we
have
done
it
before
than
that
we
doing
it
now
there
the
woman
selling
things
let
us
ask
her
they
had
noticed
before
a
personage
who
had
been
going
about
on
the
fringe
of
the
crowd
with
a
file
of
propagandist
literature
on
her
arm
vida
beckoned
to
her
she
made
her
way
with
some
difficulty
through
the
chaffing
jostling
horde
saying
steadily
and
with
a
kind
of
cheerful
doggedness
citizenship

out
in
information
you
tell
me
who
the
speakers
are
yes
the
haggard
face
brightened
before
the
task
one
is
the
famous
miss
claxton
her
face
screwed
up
because
the
sun
is
in
her
eyes
is
so
admitted
but
just
wait
till
she
speaks
the
faded
countenance
of
the
woman
with
the
heavy
pile
of
printed
propaganda
on
her
arm
was
so
lit
with
enthusiasm
that
it
too
was
almost
in
the
same
way
as
the
younger
more
regular
face
up
there
frowning
at
the
people
or
the
sun
or
the
memory
of
wrongs
miss
claxton
some
relation
of
yours
asked
oh
no
i
do
even
know
her
she
has
been
out
of
prison
long
the
man
in

mr
henry
of

i
suppose
the

is
the
lady
in
black
the
turned
away
to
make
change
for
a
new
customer
you
mean
the
mother
of
the
gracchi
said
vida
at
a
venture
and
saw
how
if
she
herself
had
understood
the
joke
the
lady
with
the
literature
did
she
laughed
that
mrs
chisholm
said
a
but
dismal
sort
of
shopman
just
behind
that
the
mother
of
those
dreadful
young
women
neither
of
the
two
ladies
were
sufficiently
posted
in
the
nefarious
goings
on
of
the
progeny
quite
to
appreciate
the
surprise
but
they
gazed
with
renewed
interest
at
the
delicate
face
can
the
man
mean
she
does
hesitated
vida
helped
her
out
with
a
laughing
whisper
agree
she
big
enough
or
bad
enough
or
old
enough
or
bold
enough
to
be
the
mother
of
young
women
renowned
for
their
dreadfulness
but
as
soon
as
she
opens
her
mouth
no
doubt
we
smell
the
brimstone
i
wish
begin
her
raging
why
are
they
waiting
only
five
minutes
past
said
the
lady
with
the
literature

they
waiting
for
lothian
scott
he
ill
but
he
come
as
though
the
example
of
his
fidelity
to
the
cause
nerved
her
to
more
earnest
prosecution
of
her
own
modest
duty
she
called
out
citizenship
of
women
by
lothian
scott
do
they
give
ye
inquired
a
tramp
that
rot
about
she
turned
away
quite
unruffled
of
women
one
penny
hope
you
get
paid
for
so
disagreeable
a
job
forgive
my
saying
so
said
vida
oh
no
she
said
cheerfully
too
hard
at
work
all
week
to
help
much
and
i
ca
speak
so
i
do
this
leaflets
citizenship
that
creature
at
the
end
detained
the
to
point
out
a
painfully
thin
eager
little
figure
sitting
on
the
ledge
of
the
plinth
and
looking
down
with
anxious
eyes
at
the
crowd
that
one
of
them
yes
i
thought
everybody
knew
that
miss
mary
she
spoke
the
name
with
an
accent
of
such
protecting
tenderness
that
vida
asked
who
is
miss
mary
but
the
had
descried
a
possible
customer
and
was
gone
said
a
old
man
the
one
that
just
come
out
o
quod
thank
you
then
to
her
sister
vida
whispered
is
quod
but
could
only
shake
her
head
even
when
they
heard
the
words
these
strange
used
meaning
often
failed
to
accompany
sound
is
mary
a
rollicking
young
rough
with
his
hat
on
the
extreme
back
of
his
head
began
to
sing
darling
yer
like
the
skilly
another
shouted
up
at
the
girl
whispered
vida
in
turn
shook
her
head
it
was
in
the
dictionary
of
any
language
she
knew
but
it
seemed
in
some
way
to
involve
dishonour
for
the
chairman
who
had
been
consulting
with
the
man
in
grey
turned
suddenly
and
faced
the
crowd
her
eyes
were
shining
with
the
light
of
battle
but
what
she
said
in
a
peculiarly
pleasant
voice
was
has
come
here
for
the
express
purpose
of
telling
you
how
she
liked
it
she
going
to
tell
us
all
about
it
but
they
let
the
thin
little
slip
of
a
girl
alone
after
that
it
was
a
a
few
moments
later
who
called
out
from
the
fringe
of
the
crowd
say
mary
yer
get
yer
rights
will
y
be
a
perliceman
even
the
tall
grave
guardians
of
the
peace
ranged
about
the
monument
even
they
smiled
at
the
suggested
image
after
all
it
might
not
be
so
uninteresting
to
listen
to
these
people
for
a
few
minutes
it
was
often
that
life
presented
such
an
opportunity
it
probably
would
never
occur
again
these
women
on
the
plinth
must
be
not
alone
of
a
different
world
but
of
a
different
clay
since
they
not
only
did
not
shrink
from
disgracing
themselves
women
had
been
capable
of
that
before
but
these
did
even
mind
ridicule
which
was
new
just
then
the
mother
of
the
gracchi
came
to
the
edge
of
the
plinth
to
open
the
meeting
she
began
the
crowd
hooted
that
proposition
to
start
with
but
the
pale
woman
with
the
candid
eyes
went
on
as
calmly
as
though
she
had
been
received
with
polite
applause
telling
the
jeering
crowd
several
things
they
certainly
had
not
known
before
that
among
other
matters
they
were
met
there
to
pass
a
censure
on
the
government
haw
said
the
deaf
old
newsvendor
with
his
free
hand
up
to
his
ear
to
express
our
sympathy
with
the
brave
women
the
staccato
cries
throughout
the
audience
dissolved
into
one
general
hoot
but
above
it
sounded
the
old
newsvendor
ca
without
shouts
about
it
and
keep
quiet
said
he
with
dignity
ai
to
sympathy
with
the
brave
women
the
steady
voice
went
on

still
in
prison
jolly
well
right
the
speaker
a
chaunce
cau
ye
said
the
newsvendor
with
a
withering
look
it
was
plain
this
old
gentleman
was
an
unblushing
adherent
to
the
cause
undismayed
by
being
apparently
the
only
one
in
that
vicinity
ready
to
cheer
the
chairman
at
every
juncture
and
equally
ready
to
administer
caustic
reproof
to
her
opponents
friends
who
are
in
prison
are
there
simply
for
trying
to
bring
before
a
member
of
the
government
old
effingham
three
cheers
for

said
the
newsvendor
on
needs
a
little
cheerin
awfter
the
mess
made
o
things
trying
to
put
before
a
member
of
the
government
a
statement
of
the
injustice

ringin
up
rows
in
the
street
you
shut
up
says
the
old
champion
out
of
patience
a
pint
too
much
everybody
in
the
vicinity
was
obliged
to
turn
and
look
at
the
youth
to
see
what
proportion
of
the
charge
was
humour
and
how
much
was
fact
the
youth
resented
so
deeply
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
that
he
fell
back
for
a
moment
on
bitter
silence
you
go
to
call
on
some
one
the
chairman
was
continuing
with
the
patient
air
of
one
instructing
a
class
in
a
kindergarten
is
the
custom
to
ring
the
bell
what
do
you
suppose
a
is
for
do
you
think
our
deputation
should
have
tried
to
get
in
without
ringing
at
the
door
no
business
goin
to
private
look
just
take
that
extry
pint
outside
the
meetin
and
cool
off
will
yer
it
was
the
last
time
that
particular
opponent
aired
his
views
the
old
man
judicious
harping
on
the
pint
induced
the
ardent
youth
to
moderate
his
political
transports
they
were
not
rightly
valued
it
appeared
after
a
few
more
mutterings
he
took
his
pint
into
some
more
congenial
society
but
there
were
several
others
in
the
crowd
who
had
come
similarly
fortified
and
they
were
everywhere
the
most
audible
opponents
but
above
argument
denial
abuse
steadily
in
that
upper
air
the
clear
voice
kept
on
you
think
they
to
go
to
his
house
have
you
heard
that
they
did
do
that
until
they
had
exhausted
every
other
means
to
get
a
hearing
to
the
shower
of
denial
and
objurgation
that
greeted
this
she
said
with
uplifted
hand
let
me
tell
you
about
it
the
action
had
in
it
so
much
of
authority
that
as
it
seemed
to
their
own
surprise
the
interrupters
with
mouths
still
open
suspended
operations
for
a
moment
this
is
a
woman
of
education
what
on
earth
is
a
person
like
that
doing
in
this
vida
asked
as
if
might
be
able
to
enlighten
her
she
see
even
if
there
were
anything
in
the
cause
as
she
calls
it
what
an
imbecile
waste
of
time
it
is
talking
to
these
louts
a
good
many
voters
here
said
a
tall
individual
wearing
a
muffler
in
lieu
of
a
collar
politician
enough
to
know
that
looked
through
the
man
only
reassuring
thing
i
see
in
the
situation
she
said
to
her
sister
that
they
do
find
many
women
to
come
and
listen
to
their
nonsense
they
got
you
and
me
awful
thought
suppose
they
converted
us
did
even
trouble
to
reply
to
such
levity
what
was
interesting
was
the
discovery
that
this
before
an
audience
so
unpromising
not
only
held
her
own
when
she
was
interrupted
and
harassed
by
the
crowd
even
more
surprising
she
bore
with
the
most
recalcitrant
members
of
it
tried
to
win
them
over
and
yet
when
they
were
rude
did
not
withhold
reproof
and
at
times
looked
down
upon
them
with
so
fine
a
scorn
that
it
seemed
as
if
even
those
ruffianly
young
men
felt
the
edge
of
it
certainly
a
curious
sight
this
woman
standing
there
in
front
of
the
soaring
column
talking
with
grave
passion
to
those
loafers
about
the
woman
question
and
they
treating
it
as
a
sunday
afternoon
street
entertainment
the
next
speaker
was
a
working
woman
the
significance
of
whose
appearance
in
that
place
and
in
that
company
was
so
little
apprehended
by
the
two
ladies
in
the
crowd
that
they
agreed
in
laughingly
commiserating
the
chairman
for
not
having
more
of
her
own
kind
to
back
her
up
in
her
absurd
contention
though
the
second
speaker
merely
bored
the
two
who
having
no
key
either
to
her
pathos
or
her
power
saw
nothing
but
cockney
effrontery
in
her
effort
she
nevertheless
had
a
distinct
success
with
the
crowd
here
was
somebody
speaking
their
own
language
they
paid
her
the
tribute
of
their
loudest
hoots
mixed
with
applause
she
never
lost
her
hold
on
them
until
the
appearance
on
the
plinth
of
a
grave
rugged
man
in
a
soft
hat
lothian
scott
small
need
for
the
chairwoman
to
introduce
the
grey
man
with
the
northern
burr
in
his
speech
and
the
northern
turn
for
the
uncompromising
in
opinion
every
soul
there
save
the
two
ladies
knew
this
was
the
man
who
had
done
more
to
make
the
labour
party
a
political
force
to
be
reckoned
with
than
any
other
creature
in
the
three
kingdoms
whether
he
was
conscious
of
having
friends
in
a
gathering
largely
tory
as
crowds
still
are
certainly
he
did
not
spare
his
enemies
during
the
first
few
minutes
of
a
speech
full
of
socialism
stirred
to
expressiveness
kept
up
a
low
running
comment
of
he
says
that
to
curry
favour
with
the
mob
a
rank
demagogue
this
man
such
pandering
to
the
populace
then
turning
sharply
to
her
companion
wants
votes
she
said
as
though
detecting
in
him
a
taste
unknown
among
the
men
in
her
purer
circle
no
doubt
he
makes
a
very
good
thing
out
of
it
going
about
filling
the
people
heads
with
revolutionary
ideas
monstrous
wickedness
call
it
stirring
up
class
against
class
i
begin
to
wonder
what
the
police
are
thinking
about
she
looked
round
uneasily
the
excitement
had
certainly
increased
as
the
little
grey
politician
denounced
the
witlessness
of
the
and
when
they
howled
at
him
went
on
to
expound
a
trenchant
doctrine
of
universal
responsibility
which
preceded
the
universal
suffrage
that
was
to
come
much
of
what
he
said
was
drowned
in
uproar
it
had
become
clear
that
his
opinions
revolted
the
majority
of
his
hearers
even
more
than
they
did
the
two
ladies
so
outraged
were
the
sensibilities
of
the
hooligan
and
the
that
they
drowned
as
much
of
the
speech
as
they
were
able
in
and
jeers
but
enough
still
penetrated
to
ears
polite
not
only
to
horrify
but
to
astonish
them
such
force
has
the
spoken
word
above
even
its
exaggeration
in
cold
print
the
ladies
had
read
sparingly
it
is
true
that
these
things
were
said
but
to
them
does
after
all
seem
to
be
saying
what
the
mob
wants
to
hear
said
the
younger
woman
mercifully
the
heart
of
the
country
is
still
sound
but
for
one
of
these
two
out
of
the
orderlier
world
the
opposition
that
the
demagogue
roused
in
the
mob
was
to
light
a
lamp
whereby
she
read
wondering
the
signs
of
an
unsuspected
bond
between
janet
and
the
reeking
throng
when
contrary
to
the
custom
of
the
demagogue
the
little
politician
in
homespun
had
confided
to
the
men
in
front
of
him
what
he
thought
of
them
he
told
them
that
the
woman
movement
which
they
held
themselves
so
clever
for
ridiculing
was
in
much
the
same
position
as
the
extension
of
suffrage
for
men
was
in
had
it
not
been
for
demonstrations
beside
which
the
action
that
had
lodged
the
women
in
gaol
was
innocent
child
play
neither
he
the
speaker
nor
any
of
the
men
in
front
of
him
would
have
the
right
to
vote
ridicule
and
denounce
these
women
for
trying
peacefully
yes
i
say
to
get
their
rights
as
citizens
do
you
know
what
our
fathers
did
to
get
ours
they
broke
down
hyde
park
railings
they
burnt
the
bristol
municipal
buildings
they
led
riots
and
they
shed
blood
these
women
have
hurt
nobody
about
the
policeman
he
went
on
steadily
comparing
the
moderation
of
the
women
with
the
violence
of
their
chartist
forbears
till
one
listener
having
lost
the
thread
hiccuped
out
do
nothin
them
women
even
after
we
showed
he
got
his
history
right
vida
asked
through
her
smiling
at
the
last
sally
that
it
applies
of
course
she
was
in
haste
to
add
what
does
it
matter
her
sister
waved
it
aside
unscrupulous
politician
has
come
here
to
bother
about
little
things
like
facts
do
think
i
altogether
agree
with
you
that
man
may
be
a
fanatic
but
he
honest
i
should
say
those
scotch
peasants
you
know
because
he
rude
and
talks
with
a
burr
you
think
he
a
sort
of
political
thomas
carlyle
though
vida
smiled
at
the
charge
something
in
her
alert
air
as
she
followed
the
brief
recapitulation
of
the
chartist
story
showed
how
an
appeal
to
justice
or
even
to
pity
may
fail
where
the
rousing
of
some
dim
sense
of
historical
significance
which
is
more
than
fear
may
arrest
and
even
stir
to
unsuspected
deeps
the
grave
scotsman
striking
that
chord
even
in
a
mind
as
innocent
as
vida
of
accurate
or
ordered
knowledge
of
the
past
even
here
the
chord
could
vibrate
to
a
strange
new
sense
of
possible
significance
in
this
scene
after
all
it
would
be
queer
it
would
be
horrible
it
was
fortunately
incredible
but
what
if
all
she
were
ignorantly
assisting
at
a
scene
that
was
to
play
its
part
in
the
greatest
revolution
the
world
had
seen
some
such
mental
playing
with
possibilities
seemed
to
lurk
behind
the
intent
reflective
face
are
far
too
many
voters
already
her
sister
had
flung
out
yes
a
much
uglier
world
they
want
to
make
but
in
the
power
to
make
history
if
these
people
indeed
had
that
then
indeed
might
they
be
worth
watching
even
if
it
were
only
after
one
good
look
to
hide
the
eyes
in
dismay
that
possibility
of
historic
significance
had
suddenly
lifted
the
sordid
exhibition
to
a
different
plane
as
the
man
amid
howls
ended
his
almost
indistinguishable
peroration
the
unmoved
chairman
stepped
forward
again
to
try
to
win
back
for
the
next
speaker
that
modicum
of
quiet
attention
which
he
at
all
events
had
the
art
of
gaining
and
of
keeping
as
she
came
forward
this
time
one
of
her
auditors
looked
at
the
woman
leader
in
the
crusade
with
new
eyes
not
with
sympathy
rather
with
a
vague
alarm
vida
levering
air
of
almost
strained
attention
was
an
unconscious
public
confession
have
understood
these
strange
women
i
have
understood
the
spirit
of
the
mob
that
hoots
the
man
we
know
vaguely
for
their
champion
i
have
understood
the
allusions
nor
the
argot
that
they
talk
i
check
the
history
that
peasant
has
appealed
to
in
the
midst
of
so
much
that
is
obscure
it
is
meet
to
reserve
judgment
something
of
that
might
have
been
read
in
the
look
lifted
once
or
twice
as
though
in
wonderment
above
the
haggard
group
up
there
between
the
guardian
lions
beyond
even
the
last
reach
of
the
tall
monument
to
the
cloudless
sky
of
june
was
the
great
shaft
itself
playing
a
part
in
the
impression
was
it
there
not
at
all
for
memory
of
some
battle
long
ago
but
just
to
mark
on
the
fair
bright
page
of
afternoon
a
huge
surprise
what
lesser
accent
than
just
this
titanic
exclamation
point
could
fitly
punctuate
the
record
of
so
strange
a
portent
women
confronting
the
populace
of
the
mightiest
city
in
the
world
pleading
in
her
most
public
place
their
right
to
a
voice
in
her
affairs
in
the
face
of
this
unexpected
mood
of
receptivity
however
unwilling
came
a
sharp
corrective
in
the
person
of
the
next
speaker
it
not
going
to
be
one
that
been
to
prison
dear
it
the
one
with
the
wild
black
hair
and
the
awful
picture
hat
but
they
stared
for
a
few
moments
as
if
in
despite
of
themselves
fascinated
by
this
lady
and
wearing
her
huge
hat
cocked
over
one
ear
with
a
defiant
coquetry
above
a
conquering
smile
the
unerring
wits
in
the
crowd
had
already
picked
her
out
for
special
attention
but
her
active
form
was
even
more
torturing
to
the
fastidious
feminine
sense
than
her
appearance
for
her
language
flowery
and
grandiloquent
was
excruciatingly
genteel
one
moment
conveyed
by
minced
words
through
a
pursed
mouth
and
the
next
carried
away
on
a
turgid
tide
of
rhetoric
the
swimmer
in
this
sea
of
sentiment
flinging
out
braceleted
arms
and
bawling
appeals
to
the
men
nof
vinglund
the
crowd
howled
with
derisive
joy
all
the
same
when
they
saw
she
had
staying
power
and
a
kind
of
transpontine
sense
of
drama
in
her
the
populace
mocked
less
and
applauded
more
why
not
she
was
very
much
like
an
overblown
adelphi
heroine
and
they
could
see
her
act
for
nothing
but
every
time
she
apostrophized
the
men
nof
vinglund
two
of
those
same
gave
way
to
overcharged
feelings
my
dear
i
ca
stand
this
i
going
home
yes
let
get
away
from
this
terrible
female
i
suppose
they
keep
back
the
best
speakers
for
the
last
the
two
ladies
turned
and
began
to
edge
their
way
out
of
the
tightly
packed
mass
of
humanity
rather
a
pity
too
said
looking
back
this
is
the
only
chance
we
ever
have
i
did
want
to
hear
what
the
skilly
was
and
about
the
sounds
as
if
it
might
be
what
she
hit
the
policeman
with
was
again
pausing
to
look
back
gyrating
female
is
more
what
i
expected
them
to
be
but
just
listen
to
that
what
the
way
they
applauding
her
they
positively
revel
in
the
creature
it
was
a
long
tiresome
business
this
worming
their
way
out
they
paused
again
and
again
two
or
three
times
looking
back
at
the
scene
with
a
recurrent
curiosity
and
each
time
repelled
by
the
platform
graces
of
the
lady
who
was
so
obviously
enjoying
herself
to
the
top
of
her
bent
yet
even
after
the
fleeing
twain
arrived
on
the
fringe
of
the
greatly
augmented
crowd
something
even
then
prevented
their
instantly
making
the
most
of
their
escape
they
stood
criticizing
and
denouncing
again
said
it
was
a
pity
since
they
were
there
that
they
should
have
to
go
without
hearing
one
of
those
who
had
been
in
prison
we
never
have
another
chance
said
her
sister
looking
back
at
the
gesticulating
figure
we
being
a
little
unreasonable
we
were
annoyed
at
first
because
they
were
what
we
expected
and
when
we
get
what
we
came
to
see
we
run
away
while
still
they
lingered
with
a
final
fling
of
arms
and
toss
of
plumes
the
champion
of
the
women
of
england
sat
down
in
the
midst
of
applause
hear
it
all
very
well
most
of
them
simply
loved
it
and
now
the
chairman
in
a
strikingly
different
style
was
preparing
the
way
for
the
next
speaker
at
mention
of
whom
the
crowd
seemed
to
feel
they
been
neglecting
their
prerogative
of
hissing
name
did
she
say
why
do
they
make
that
noise
the
two
ladies
began
to
worm
their
way
back
but
this
was
a
different
matter
from
coming
out
yer
doin
some
one
inquired
sternly
of
another
turned
sharply
out
oo
yer

the
horrid

creatures

to
have
no
sense
of

the
stuff
they
smoked

getting
the
full
benefit
of
a
noxious
puff

the

angrily

recovering
herself

she
said
mendaciously
trying
to
appease
the
defiler
of
the
air
with
a
little
smile
indeed
the
idea
of
having
come
to
this
person
for
a
vote
was
sufficiently
quaint
is
the
sort
of
thing
they
mean

she
said
hastily
can
make
herself
heard
without
screeching
but
having
lost
the
key
during
the
passage
over
the
pipe
they
could
only
make
out
that
she
was
justifying
some
one
to
the
mob
some
one
who
apparently
was
coming
in
for
too
much
sharp
criticism
for
the
chairman
to
fling
her
to
the
wolves
without
first
diverting
them
a
little
the
battle
of
words
that
ensued
was
almost
entirely
unintelligible
to
the
two
ladies
but
they
gathered
through
means
more
expressive
than
speech
that
the
chairman
was
dealing
with
some
sort
of
crisis
in
the
temper
of
the
meeting
brought
about
by
the
mention
of
a
name
the
only
thing
clear
was
that
she
was
neither
going
to
give
in
nor
going
to
turn
over
the
meeting
in
a
state
of
ferment
to
some
less
practised
hand
she
did
she
had
a
perfect
right
the
chairman
maintained
against
a
storm
of
noes
than
a
right
to
perform
in
going
with
that
deputation
on
public
business
to
the
house
of
a
public
servant
since
unlike
the
late
prime
minister
he
had
refused
to
women
all
opportunity
to
treat
with
him
through
the
usual
channels
always
open
to
citizens
having
a
political
grievance
suffragettes
well
she
set
her
mouth
if
you
like
to
get
an
abuse
listened
to
is
the
first
thing
to
get
it
understood
is
the
next
rather
than
not
have
our
cause
stand
out
clear
and
unmistakable
before
a
preoccupied
careless
world
we
accept
the
clumsy
label
we
wear
it
proudly
and
it
wo
be
the
first
time
in
history
that
a
name
given
in
derision
has
become
a
badge
of
honour
why
the
woman
eyes
were
suffused
a
flush
had
mounted
up
to
her
hair
how
she
cared
ai
told
us
the
reason
ye
the
vote
why
she
a
woman
haw
the
speaker
had
never
paused
an
instant
but
it
began
to
be
clear
that
she
heard
any
interruption
it
suited
her
to
hear
one
asking
at
this
time
of
day
why
women
want
the
vote
why
for
exactly
the
same
reason
that
you
men
do
because
not
having
any
voice
in
public
affairs
our
interests
are
neglected
and
since
interests
are
man
all
humanity
suffers
we
want
the
vote
because
taxation
without
representation
is
tyranny
because
the
laws
as
they
stand
bear
hardly
on
women
and
because
those
unfair
laws
will
never
be
altered
till
women
have
a
share
in
electing
the
men
who
control
legislation
ought
ter
leave
politics
to
us
ca
leave
politics
to
the
men
because
politics
have
come
into
the
home
and
if
the
higher
interests
of
the
home
are
to
be
served
women
must
come
into
politics
a
bad
argument
i
always
say
is
change
nature
nature
says
at
and
mind
business
the
interjections
seemed
to
come
all
at
once
the
woman
bent
over
the
crowd
nothing
misty
in
her
eyes
now
rather
a
keener
light
than
before
you
see
she
appealed
to
them
as
equals
you
see
that
in
your
improvement
of
the
world
you
men
have
taken
women
business
out
of
her
home
in
the
old
days
there
was
work
and
responsibility
enough
for
woman
without
going
outside
her
own
gate
the
women
were
the
bakers
and
brewers
the
soap
and
the
of
the
world
you
men
she
said
delicately
flattering
them
have
changed
all
that
you
have
built
great
factories
and
warehouses
and
mills
but
how
do
you
keep
them
going
by
calling
women
to
come
in
their
thousands
and
help
you
but
women
love
their
homes
you
could
have
got
these
women
out
of
their
homes
without
the
goad
of
poverty
you
men
ca
always
earn
enough
to
keep
the
poor
little
home
going
so
the
women
work
in
the
shops
they
swarm
at
the
mill
gates
and
the
factories
are
full
true
every
blessed
word
said
the
old
newsvendor
she
said
interrupt
in
taking
women
business
out
of
the
home
you
have
freed
her
from
the
need
to
see
after
the
business
the
need
is
greater
than
ever
it
was
why
per
cent
of
the
women
of
this
country
are
women
yet
you
go
on
foolishly
echoing
woman
place
is
at
home
true
said
the
aged
champion
unabashed
there
are
those
men
philanthropists
statesmen
who
believe
they
are
safeguarding
the
interests
of
women
by
making
laws
restricting
their
work
and
so
restricting
their
resources
without
ever
consulting
these
women
if
they
consulted
these
women
they
would
hear
truths
that
would
open
their
blind
eyes
but
no
the
woman
is
worthy
of
being
consulted
she
is
worthy
to
do
the
highest
work
given
to
humanity
to
bear
and
to
bring
up
children
she
is
worthy
to
teach
and
to
train
them
she
is
worthy
to
pay
the
taxes
that
she
has
no
voice
in
levying
if
she
breaks
the
law
that
she
has
no
share
in
making
she
is
worth
hanging
but
she
is
not
worth
consulting
about
her
own
affairs
affairs
of
supremest
importance
to
her
very
existence
affairs
that
no
man
however
great
and
good
can
understand
so
well
as
she
she
will
never
get
justice
until
she
gets
the
vote
even
the
woman
are
even
the
woman
of
what
are
called
the
upper
classes
even
she
must
wince
at
the
times
when
men
throw
off
the
mask
and
let
her
see
how
in
their
hearts
they
despise

the

up
in

english
parliament
that
englishmen
are
supposed
to
think
of
with
such
respect
as
a
place
of
dignity
what
she
leaned
forward
and
her

in
that
sacred
place
that

where
they

of

what
happened
to
honour
that
these
men
dare
tell
us
is
so
safe
in
their
hands
our
cause
was
dragged
through
filth
the
very
name
woman
was
used
as
a
signal
for
jests
and
ribald
laughter
and
for
such
an
exhibition
of
sex
rancour
and
mistrust
that
it
passed
imagination
to
think
what
the
mothers
and
wives
of
the
members
must
think
of
the
public
confession
of
the
deep
disrespect
their
menfolk
feel
for
them
some
one
here
spoke
of
a
row
she
threw
back
her
head
and
faced
the
issue
as
though
she
knew
that
by
bringing
it
forward
herself
she
could
turn
the
taunt
against
the
next
speaker
into
a
title
of
respect
blame
us
for
making
a
scene
in
that
holy
place
you
would
have
us
imitate
those
other
women
the
the
women
who
think
more
of
manners
than
of
morals
there
they
were
for
an
example
to
us
that
night
of
the
debate
that
night
of
the
row
there
they
sat
as
they
have
always
done
like
meek
mute
slaves
up
there
in
their
little
gilded
pen
ready
to
listen
to
any
insult
ready
to
smile
on
the
men
afterward
in
only
one
way
but
it
was
an
important
exception
in
just
one
way
that
debate
on
woman
suffrage
differed
from
any
other
that
had
ever
taken
place
in
the
house
of
commons
a
voice
in
the
crowd
was
raised
but
before
the
jeer
was
out
chisholm
had
flung
down
her
last
ringing
sentences
were
up
there
in
the
little
pen
that
night
women
too
but
women
with
enough
decency
to
be
revolted
and
with
enough
character
to
resent
such
treatment
as
the
members
down
there
on
the
floor
of
the
house
were
giving
to
our
measure
though
the
women
who
ought
to
have
felt
it
most
sat
there
cowed
and
silent
i
am
proud
to
think
there
were
other
women
who
cried
out
yes
yes
she
interrupted
the
interrupters
women
were
dragged
away
to
prison
and
all
the
world
was
aghast
but
i
tell
you
that
cry
was
the
beginning
of
a
new
chapter
in
human
history
it
began
with
shame
but
it
will
end
with
honour
the
old
newsvendor
led
the
applause
that
woman
never
spat
in
a

pull
it
down
and
do
turn
round
a
little
dazed
by
the
torrent
the
woman
on
the
plinth
was
still
pouring
down
on
the
people
vida
mind
at
the
word
so
peremptorily
uttered
reverted
by
some
trick
of
association
to
the
oriental
significance
of
that
mark
in
dress
distinctively
the
woman
should
i
pull
down
my
veil
she
answered
abstractedly
looking
this
way
do
turn
round
come

with
a
surprising
alacrity
and
skill
made
her
way
out
of
the
throng

yet
looking
back

i
want
you
men
to
give
a
fair
hearing
to
a
woman
who
look
mercifully
they
too
much
amused
to
notice
us
disobeying
the
mandate
the
younger

eyes
fell
at
last
upon
the
figures
of
two
young
men
hovering
on
the
outer
circle

their
tall
glossy
hats

upon
the
single
flower
in

on

and
gleamed
mockingly
on
the
white
teeth
of
the
one
who
smiled

broadest
as
they
both
stood
craning
their
necks
whispering
and
laughing
on
the

crowd

chapter

devoutly
thankful
at
having
escaped
from
her
compromising
position
unrecognized
firmly
declined
to
go
fur
the
vote
again
when
vida
gave
up
her
laughing
remonstrance
thought
her
sister
had
also
given
up
the
idea
but
as
vida
afterwards
confessed
she
told
herself
that
she
would
go
once
more
it
could
not
be
but
what
she
was
under
some
illusion
about
that
queer
spectacle
from
one
impression
each
admitted
it
was
difficult
to
shake
herself
free
whatever
those
women
were
or
were
not
they
were
fools
what
did
the
leaders
in
prison
and
out
what
did
they
think
they
were
accomplishing
besides
making
themselves
hideously
uncomfortable
the
english
parliament
having
flung
them
out
had
gone
on
with
its
routine
precisely
as
though
nothing
had
happened
anything
happened
that
was
the
question
the
papers
could
answer
they
were
given
over
to
lies
the
bare
idea
of
women
pretending
to
concern
themselves
with
public
affairs
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
press
it
was
enough
to
make
the
soberest
sides
shake
with
homeric
laughter
so
then
one
last
time
to
see
for
one
self
and
on
this
occasion
no
pettiness
of
disguise
miss
levering
aspect
seemed
to
say
no
recurrence
of
any
undignified
flight
she
had
been
frightened
away
from
her
first
meeting
but
she
would
not
be
frightened
from
the
second
which
was
also
to
be
the
last
an
instinct
unanalyzed
but
significant
of
what
was
to
follow
kept
her
from
seeking
companionship
outside
had
wark
not
gone
over
to
the
her
former
mistress
would
have
had
no
misgiving
about
taking
the
woman
into
her
confidence
but
wark
with
lightning
rapidity
had
become
anderson
slynes
and
was
beyond
recall
so
the
new
maid
was
told
the
following
sunday
that
she
might
walk
with
her
mistress
across
hyde
park
where
the
papers
said
the
meetings
in
future
were
to
be
carrying
some
music
which
had
to
be
returned
to
the
tunbridges
pursuing
this
programme
what
more
natural
than
that
those
two
chance
pedestrians
should
be
arrested
by
an
apparition
on
their
way
of
a
flaming
banner
bearing
along
with
a
demand
for
the
vote
an
outrageous
charge
against
a
distinguished
public
servant
pity
the
misguided
creatures
did
know
him
just
a
little
yes
there
it
was
a
rectangle
of
red
screaming
across
the
vivid
green
of
the
park
not
a
hundred
yards
from
the
marble
arch
the
denunciatory
banner
stretched
above
the
side
of
an
uncovered
van
a
little
crowd
of
perhaps
a
hundred
collected
on
one
side
of
the
cart
the
loafers
on
the
outermost
fringe
lying
on
the
grass
never
a
sign
of
a
suffragette
and
nearly
three
impossible
for
any
to
carry
out
the
programme
of
pausing
to
ask
idly
are
those
women
screeching
about
seeming
to
search
in
vain
for
some
excuse
to
linger
miss
wandering
eye
fell
upon
a
young
mother
wheeling
a
perambulator
she
had
glanced
with
mild
curiosity
at
the
flaunting
ensign
and
then
turned
from
it
to
lean
forward
and
straighten
her
baby
cap
wonder
what
thinks
of
the
woman
question
miss
levering
observed
in
a
careless
aside
to
her
maid
before
gorringe
could
reply
a
bootiful
angel
is
doddy
said
the
young
mother
with
subdued
rapture
she
found
the
solution
said
the
lady
looking
back
other
pedestrians
glanced
at
the
little
crowd
about
the
cart
read
demand
and
denunciation
on
the
banner
laughed
and
they
too
for
the
most
part
went
on
an
eton
boy
who
looked
as
if
he
might
be
her
grandson
came
by
with
a
lady
of
distinguished
aspect
who
held
up
her
voluminous
silken
skirts
and
stared
silently
at
the
legend
you
see
what
it
says
the
eton
boy
laughed
as
he
looked
back
demand
the
fancy
they
demand
it
what
awful
cheek
and
he
laughed
again
at
the
fatuity
of
the
female
creature
vida
glanced
at
the
dignified
old
dame
as
though
with
an
uneasy
new
sense
of
the
incongruity
in
the
attitude
of
those
two
quite
commonplace
everyday
members
of
a
world
that
was
her
world
and
that
yet
could
for
a
moment
look
quite
strange
she
turned
and
glanced
back
at
the
ridiculous
cart
as
if
summoning
the
invisible
presence
of
chisholm
to
moderate
the
insolence
of
the
budding
male
still
there
was
no
sign
either
of
chisholm
or
any
of
her
against
the
old
order
of
the
world
miss
levering
stood
a
moment
hesitating
believe
i
a
little
tired
she
said
to
the
discreet
maid
rest
here
a
moment
and
she
sat
down
with
her
back
to
the
crowd
a
woman
apparently
of
the
small
shopkeeping
class
was
already
established
at
one
end
of
the
only
bench
anywhere
near
the
cart
her
child
who
was
playing
about
was
neatly
dressed
and
to
vida
surprise
wore
sandals
on
her
stockingless
feet
this
fashion
for
children
which
had
been
growing
for
years
among
the
upper
classes
had
found
little
imitation
among
tradesmen
or
working
people
they
presumably
were
still
too
near
the
difficulty
of
keeping
their
children
in
shoes
and
stockings
to
be
able
to
see
anything
but
a
confession
of
failure
in
going
without
in
the
same
way
the
life
when
led
by
the
rich
wears
to
the
an
aspect
of
masked
meanness
a
matter
far
less
tolerable
in
the
eyes
of
the
pauper
than
the
traditional
splendour
of
extravagance
in
the
upper
class
an
extravagance
that
feeds
more
than
the
famished
stomach
with
the
crumbs
that
it
lets
fall
as
miss
levering
sat
watching
the
child
and
wondering
a
little
at
the
sandals
the
woman
caught
her
eye
you
please
tell
me
the
time
she
asked
miss
levering
took
out
her
watch
and
then
spoke
of
the
wisdom
of
that
plan
of
sandals
the
woman
answered
with
such
and
good
sense
that
the
lady
sent
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
as
if
relishing
in
advance
the
sturdy
disapproval
of
this
highly
respectable
young
mother
when
she
should
come
to
realize
how
near
she
and
the
precious
daughter
were
to
the
rostrum
of
the
shrieking
sisterhood
it
might
be
worth
prolonging
the
discussion
upon
health
and
education
for
the
amusement
there
would
be
in
seeing
what
form
condemnation
of
the
suffragettes
took
among
people
of
this
kind
by
turning
her
head
to
one
side
out
of
the
tail
of
her
eye
the
lady
could
see
that
an
excitement
of
some
sort
was
agitating
the
crowd
the
voices
rose
more
shrill
people
craned
and
pushed
a
derisive
cheer
went
up
as
a
woman
appeared
on
the
cart
the
wearer
of
the
three
others
followed
all
women
miss
levering
saw
without
seeming
to
look
still
listening
while
the
mother
talked
on
about
her
child
and
what
good
for
it
all
life
had
resolved
itself
into
pursuit
of
that
an
air
of
came
over
the
lady
it
was
as
if
in
the
presence
of
this
excellent
bourgeoise
she
felt
an
absurd
constraint
in
showing
an
interest
in
the
proceedings
of
these
unsexed
creatures
behind
them
to
her
obvious
astonishment
the
mother
of
the
child
was
the
first
to
jump
up
they
going
to
begin
she
said
briskly
asked
miss
levering
the
suffrage
people
are
going
to
listen
to
them
that
what
i
come
all
this
way
for
and
she
and
her
offspring
melted
into
the
growing
crowd
vida
turned
to
the
maid
and
met
her
superior
smile
woman
says
she
has
come
a
long
way
to
hear
these
people
advocating
woman
suffrage
and
slowly
with
an
air
of
complete
detachment
she
approached
the
edge
of
the
crowd
followed
by
the
supercilious
maid
they
were
quickly
hemmed
in
by
people
who
seemed
to
spring
up
out
of
the
ground
it
was
curious
to
look
back
over
the
vivid
green
expanse
and
see
the
dotted
humanity
running
like
ants
from
all
directions
to
listen
to
this
handful
of
dowdy
women
in
a
cart
in
finding
her
way
through
the
crowd
it
would
appear
that
the
lady
was
not
much
sustained
by
the
presence
of
a
servant
however
much
out
of
place
in
such
a
gathering
as
or
any
woman
was
still
more
incongruous
showed
there
the
relation
of
mistress
and
maid
the
punctilious
gorringe
was
plainly
horrified
at
the
proximity
to
her
mistress
of
these
canaille
and
the
mistress
was
not
so
absorbed
it
would
seem
but
what
she
felt
the
affront
to
seemliness
in
a
servant
seeing
her
pushed
and
shoved
aside
treated
with
slight
regard
or
none
necessary
either
to
leave
the
scene
with
lofty
disapproval
or
else
make
light
of
the
discomfort
does
matter
she
assured
the
girl
who
was
trying
to
protect
her
mistress
dainty
wrap
from
contact
with
a
grimy
tramp
and
again
when
half
a
dozen
boys
forced
their
way
past
all
right
she
nodded
to
the
maid
no
worse
than
the
crowd
at
charing
cross
coming
over
from
paris
but
it
was
much
worse
and
gorringe
knew
it
old
man
is
standing
on
your
gown
miss
would
you
mind
miss
levering
politely
suggested
another
place
for
his
feet
but
the
old
man
had
no
mind
left
for
a
mere
bystander
it
was
all
absorbed
in
suffragettes
feet
are
filthy
muddy
whispered
gorringe
it
may
have
been
in
part
the
maid
genteel
horror
of
such
proximities
that
steeled
miss
levering
to
endure
them
under
circumstances
like
these
the
observant
are
reminded
that
no
section
of
the
modern
community
is
so
scornfully
aristocratic
as
our
servants
their
horror
of
the
and
the
humble
is
beyond
the
scorn
of
kings
the
fine
lady
shares
her
shrinking
with
those
inveterate
enemies
of
democracy
the
lackey
who
shuts
the
door
in
the
shabby
stranger
face
and
the
dog
who
barks
a
beggar
from
the
gate
and
so
while
the
maid
drew
her
own
skirts
aside
and
held
her
nose
high
in
the
air
the
gentlewoman
stood
faintly
smiling
at
the
queer
scene
alas
no
chisholm
it
looked
as
if
they
must
have
been
hard
up
for
speakers
for
two
of
them
were
younger
even
than
miss
claxton
of
the
one
of
them
could
be
more
than
nineteen
dreadful
to
put
such
very
young
girls
up
there
to
be
stared
at
by
all
these
louts
yes
quite
agreed
the
maid
but
with
the
air
of
can
you
expect
of
persons
so
low
the
young
girls
seem
to
have
as
much
as
the
older
ones
pursued
miss
levering
as
she
looked
in
vain
for
any
sign
of
flinching
from
the
sallies
of
cockney
impudence
directed
at
the
occupants
of
the
cart
they
exhibited
too
what
was
perhaps
even
stranger
an
utter
absence
of
any
flaunting
of
courage
or
the
smallest
show
of
defiance
what
was
this
armour
that
looked
like
mere
indifference
it
could
be
that
those
young
girls
indifferent
to
the
ordeal
of
standing
up
there
before
a
crowd
of
jeering
rowdies
whose
less
objectionable
utterances
were
did
you
get
that
one
in
green
is
my
girl
yer
miss
and
utterances
the
person
thus
pointedly
alluded
to
left
her
companions
ranged
along
the
side
of
the
cart
against
the
background
of
banner
while
she
the
famous
miss
claxton
took
the
meeting
in
charge
she
wasted
no
time
this
lady
her
opening
remarks
which
in
the
face
of
a
fire
of
interruption
took
the
form
of
an
attack
upon
the
government
showed
her
an
alert
competent
imperturbably
politician
who
knew
every
aspect
of
the
history
of
the
movement
as
able
to
answer
any
intelligent
question
as
to
snub
an
impudent
irrelevance
able
to
take
up
a
point
and
drive
it
well
in
to
shrug
and
smile
or
frown
and
point
her
finger
all
with
most
telling
effect
and
keep
the
majority
of
her
audience
with
her
every
minute
of
the
time
as
a
mere
exhibition
of
nerve
it
was
a
thing
to
make
you
open
your
eyes
only
a
moment
was
she
arrested
by
either
booing
or
applause
when
a
knot
of
young
men
who
had
pushed
their
way
near
the
front
kept
on
shouting
argument
and
abuse
she
interrupted
her
harangue
an
instant
pointing
out
the
you
be
quiet
if
you
please
she
said
people
are
here
to
listen
to
they
ai
they
come
to
see
wot
you
look
like
ca
be
so
she
said
calmly
after
they
seen
us
they
stay
then
as
the
interrupter
began
again
it
no
use
my
man
she
shook
her
head
gently
as
if
almost
sorry
for
him
talk
down
ai
that
just
a
woman
he
complained
to
the
crowd
just
in
front
of
where
miss
levering
and
her
satellite
first
came
to
a
standstill
was
a
cheerful
big
sandy
man
with
long
flowing
moustachios
a
polo
cap
and
a
very
dirty
collar
at
intervals
he
inquired
of
the
men
around
him
in
a
great
jovial
voice
we
as
though
the
meeting
had
been
called
not
for
the
purpose
of
rousing
interest
in
the
question
of
woman
share
in
the
work
of
the
world
but
as
though
its
object
were
to
humiliate
and
disfranchise
the
men
but
his
exclamation
repeated
at
intervals
came
in
as
a
sort
of
refrain
to
the
rest
of
the
proceedings
conservatives
said
the
speaker
never
pretended
they
favoured
broadening
the
basis
of
the
franchise
but
here
were
these
liberals
for
thirty
years
they
been
saying
that
the
demand
on
the
part
of
women
for
political
recognition
commanded
their
respect
and
would
have
their
support
and
yet
there
were
four
hundred
and
odd
members
who
had
got
into
the
house
of
commons
very
largely
through
the
efforts
of
women
oh
yes
we
know
all
about
that
we
been
helping
the
men
at
elections
for
years
party
adroitly
she
replied
have
members
of
every
party
in
our
ranks
you
a
conservative
i
myself
am
not
a
conservative
work
for
the
labour
men
i
know
child
play
belonging
to
any
party
till
we
get
the
vote
she
dismissed
it
future
we
are
neither
for
liberal
nor
conservative
nor
labour
we
are
for
women
when
we
get
the
sex
bar
removed
it
will
be
time
for
us
to
sort
ourselves
into
parties
at
present
we
are
united
against
any
government
that
continues
to
ignore
its
duty
to
the
women
of
the
country
in
the
past
we
were
so
confiding
that
when
a
candidate
said
he
was
in
favour
of
woman
suffrage
he
was
usually
a
liberal
we
worked
like
slaves
to
get
that
man
elected
so
that
a
voice
might
be
raised
for
women
interests
in
the
next
parliament
again
and
again
the
man
we
worked
for
got
in
but
the
voice
that
was
to
speak
for
us
that
voice
was
mute
we
had
served
his
purpose
in
helping
him
to
win
his
seat
and
we
found
ourselves
invariably
forgotten
or
ignored
the
conservatives
have
never
shown
the
abysmal
hypocrisy
of
the
liberals
we
can
get
on
with
our
open
enemies
it
these
and
groans
cowards
i
say
who
in
order
to
sneak
into
a
place
in
the
house
pretend
to
sympathize
with
this
reform
who
use
us
and
then
betray
us
it
these
who
are
women
enemies
are
you
always
worrying
the
liberals
why
do
you
ask
the
conservatives
to
give
you
the
vote
do
go
to
a
person
for
something
he
has
got
unless
you
a
fool
the
liberals
are
in
power
the
liberals
were
readiest
with
fair
promises
and
so
we
go
to
the
liberals
and
we
shall
continue
to
go
to
them
we
shall
never
leave
off
boos
and
groans
they
leave
office
then
we
begin
on
the
conservatives
she
ended
in
a
chorus
of
laughter
and
cheers
will
now
call
upon
miss
cynthia
chisholm
to
propose
the
resolution
wherewith
the
chairman
gave
way
to
the
younger
of
the
two
girls
this
one
of
the
gracchi
a
creature
carelessly
dressed
grave
and
simple
faced
the
mob
with
evident
trepidation
a
few
notes
to
which
she
never
referred
in
her
shaking
hand
what
brought
a
girl
like
that
here
was
the
question
on
the
few
thoughtful
faces
in
the
crowd
confronting
her
she
answered
the
query
by
introducing
the
resolution
in
an
earnest
little
speech
which
if
it
did
show
that
much
of
the
failure
and
suffering
that
darken
the
face
of
the
world
is
due
to
women
false
position
showed
at
all
events
that
this
young
creature
held
a
burning
conviction
that
the
subjection
of
her
sex
was
the
with
no
apparent
apprehension
of
the
colossal
audacity
of
her
position
the
girl
moved
gravely
that
meeting
demands
of
the
government
the
insertion
of
an
enfranchisement
clause
in
the
plural
voting
bill
and
demands
that
it
shall
become
law
during
the
present
session
her
ignorance
of
parliamentary
procedure
was
freely
pointed
out
to
her
she
said
is
you
who
are
ignorant
of
how
pressing
the
need
is
you
say
it
is
out
of
order
if
treating
the
women
of
the
country
fairly
is
out
of
order
it
is
only
because
men
have
made
a
poor
sort
of
order
it
is
the
that
should
be
changed
of
course
that
dictum
received
its
due
amount
of
hooting
vote
is
the
reward
for
defending
the
country
said
a
voice
said
the
girl
promptly
soldiers
and
sailors
do
vote
implies
fitness
for
military
service
somebody
amended
said
nineteen
calmly
ought
to
imply
merely
in
the
country
no
one
denies
we
have
that
the
crowd
kept
on
about
soldiering
till
the
speaker
was
goaded
into
saying
do
say
women
like
fighting
but
women
fight
in
these
days
warfare
is
any
more
a
matter
of
great
physical
strength
and
a
woman
can
pull
a
trigger
as
well
as
a
man
the
boer
women
found
that
out
and
so
has
the
russian
i
do
like
thinking
about
it
myself
for
i
seem
to
realize
too
clearly
what
horrors
those
women
endured
before
they
could
carry
bombs
or
shoulder
rifles
why
a
woman
ca
never
hit
is
quite
true
we
ca
most
of
us
even
throw
a
stone
straight
the
great
mass
of
women
never
in
all
their
lives
wanted
to
hit
anybody
or
anything
and
that
she
came
nearer
and
leaned
over
the
side
of
the
cart
with
scared
face
that
that
makes
it
so
dreadful
to
realize
how
at
last
when
women
eyes
are
opened
when
they
see
their
homes
and
the
holiest
things
in
life
threatened
and
despised
how
quickly
after
all
can
learn
the
art
of
hatpins
some
one
called
out
scratching
and
spitting
another
added
that
sort
of
interruption
did
not
so
much
embarrass
her
but
once
or
twice
she
was
nearly
thrown
off
her
by
men
and
boys
shouting
the
matter
with
yer
anyway
ca
yer
get
a
husband
and
brilliant
relevancies
although
she
flushed
at
some
of
these
sallies
she
stuck
to
her
guns
with
a
pluck
that
won
her
friends
in
one
of
the
pauses
a
choleric
old
man
gesticulated
with
his
umbrella
what
the
world
needed
was
woman
suffrage
it
would
have
been
left
for
a
minx
like
you
to
discover
it
at
which
volleys
of
approval
gentleman
seems
to
think
it
a
new
madness
that
we
recently
invented
the
child
seemed
in
her
loneliness
to
reach
out
for
companioning
she
spoke
of
friend
john
stuart
mill
mill
great
liberal
wrote
in
but
mill
and
she
were
drowned
together
she
waited
a
moment
for
the
flood
of
derision
to
subside
would
nothin
to
do
with
yer
if
thought
you
go
on
like
you
done
disraeli
was
on
our
side
mazzini
charles
kingsley
as
long
ago
as
a
woman
suffrage
bill
that
was
drafted
by
pankhurst
and
jacob
bright
passed
a
second
reading
best
sort
of
women
wanted
it
kind
of
women
in
the
past
who
cared
to
be
associated
with
this
reform
they
were
women
like
florence
nightingale
and
harriet
martineau
and
josephine
butler
and
the
two
thousand
other
women
of
influence
who
memorialized
mr
gladstone
something
was
called
out
that
vida
could
not
hear
but
that
brought
the
painful
scarlet
into
the
young
face
shame
some
of
the
men
were
denouncing
the
interjection
after
a
little
pause
the
girl
found
her
voice
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
tell
you
what
i
think
you
ought
to
know
i
do
believe
i
could
go
on
if
i
did
see
over
there
the
reformer
tree
it
makes
me
think
of
how
much
had
to
be
borne
before
other
changes
could
be
brought
about
she
reminded
the
people
of
what
had
been
said
and
suffered
on
that
very
spot
in
the
past
before
the
men
standing
before
her
had
got
the
liberties
they
enjoyed
were
and
so
perhaps
it
was
so
hard
for
them
i
do
know
and
sure
it
was
hard
enough
when
we
women
remember
what
though
you
think
meanly
of
us
because
we
ca
be
soldiers
you
may
as
well
know
we
are
ready
to
do
whatever
has
to
be
done
we
are
ready
to
bear
whatever
has
to
be
borne
there
seem
to
be
things
harder
to
face
than
bullets
but
it
does
matter
they
be
faced
the
lady
standing
with
her
maid
in
the
incongruous
crowd
looked
round
once
or
twice
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
say
much
stranger
life
is
than
we
are
half
the
time
aware
and
how
much
stranger
it
bids
fair
to
be
the
rude
platform
with
the
scarlet
backing
flaming
in
the
face
of
the
glorious
summer
afternoon
near
the
very
spot
upon
which
the
great
battles
for
reform
had
been
fought
out
in
the
past
and
in
place
of
england
sturdy
freeman
making
his
historic
appeal
for
justice
and
admission
to
the
commons
a
girl
pouring
out
this
stream
of
vigorous
english
upholding
the
cause
her
family
had
stood
for
her
voice
failed
her
a
little
towards
the
close
or
rather
it
did
not
so
much
fail
as
betray
to
any
sensitive
listener
the
degree
of
strain
she
put
upon
it
to
make
it
carry
above
laughter
and
interjection
as
she
raised
the
note
she
bent
over
the
crowd
leaning
forward
with
her
neck
outstretched
the
cords
in
it
swelling
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
bringing
a
flush
and
a
moisture
to
her
face
steadying
her
voice
as
the
thought
of
the
struggle
to
come
shook
and
clouded
it
and
calling
on
the
people
to
judge
of
this
matter
without
prejudice
it
was
a
thing
to
live
in
the
memory
the
vision
of
that
earnest
child
trying
to
fire
the
london
louts
with
the
great
names
of
the
past
and
failing
to
see
her
bite
her
lip
to
keep
back
tears
and
bending
over
the
rabble
find
a
choked
voice
to
say
your
forefathers
and
foremothers
who
suffered
for
the
freedom
you
young
men
enjoy
if
they
could
come
out
of
their
graves
and
see
how
their
descendants
use
the
great
privileges
they
won
i
believe
they
would
go
back
into
their
graves
and
pull
the
shrouds
over
their
eyes
to
hide
them
from
your
shame
hear
you
are
but
she
was
done
she
turned
away
and
found
friendly
hands
stretched
out
to
draw
her
to
a
seat
the
next
speaker
was
an
alert
little
woman
with
a
provincial
accent
and
the
briskness
of
a
whose
prettiness
combined
with
pertness
rather
demoralized
the
mob
and
women
she
began
pitching
her
rather
thin
voice
several
notes
too
high
and
women
some
one
piped
in
mimicry
and
the
crowd
dissolved
in
laughter
it
was
curious
to
note
again
how
that
occasional
exaggerated
shrillness
of
the
feminine
voice
when
raised
in
the
open
air
how
it
amused
the
mob
they
imitated
the
falsetto
with
squeals
of
delight
each
time
she
began
afresh
she
was
met
by
the
shrill
echo
of
her
own
voice
the
contest
went
on
for
several
minutes
the
spectacle
of
the
agitated
little
figure
bobbing
and
gesticulating
and
nothing
heard
but
shrill
squeaks
raised
a
very
pandemonium
of
merriment
it
did
mend
matters
for
her
to
say
when
she
did
get
a
hearing
come
all
the
way
from
place
indistinguishable
in
the
confusion
talk
to
you
this
afternoon
kind
you
reely
think
they
could
spare
you
i
going
to
convert
every
man
within
reach
of
my
voice
groans
and
hear
see
you
try
she
talked
on
quite
inaudibly
for
the
most
part
a
phrase
here
and
there
came
out
and
the
rest
lost
so
much
hilarity
in
the
crowd
attracted
to
it
a
bibulous
gentleman
who
kept
calling
out
the
pretty
dear
to
the
rapture
of
the
bystanders
he
became
so
elevated
that
the
police
were
obliged
to
remove
him
when
the
excitement
attending
this
passage
had
calmed
down
the
reformer
was
perceived
to
be
still
piping
away
long
are
you
goin
on
like
this
you
goin
to
stop
not
for
a
long
time
she
shrilled
cheerfully
got
the
accumulations
of
on
me
and
i
only
just
beginning
to
unload
although
we
have
got
the
vote
never
mind
got
our
tongues
do
we
know
it
said
a
gentleman
in
a
rusty
topper
one
too
intolerable
said
a
man
to
his
companion
she
ought
to
be
smacked
they
melted
out
of
the
crowd
got
our
tongues
and
i
been
going
round
among
all
the
women
i
know
getting
them
to
promise
to
their
tongues
stand
up
there
and
tell
us
they
needed
use
their
tongues
to
such
purpose
that
it
wo
be
women
but
who
get
up
the
next
monster
petition
to
parliament
asking
for
suffrage
she
went
down
under
a
flood
of
jeers
and
rose
to
the
surface
again
to
say
man
petition
praying
parliament
for
goodness
sake
give
those
women
the
vote
yes
you
better
be
seeing
about
that
petition
my
friends
for
i
tell
you
there
is
going
to
be
any
peace
till
we
get
the
franchise
now
they
give
anything
when
the
jeering
had
died
a
little
and
she
came
to
the
top
once
more
she
was
discovered
to
be
shouting
men
just
better
keep
an
eye
on
us
take
our
eyes
off
yer
suffragettes
have
a
day
of
rest
every
day
in
the
week
while
you
men
are
at
work
or
sitting
in
the
we
are
visiting
the
women
in
their
homes
explaining
and
stirring
them
up
to
a
sense
of
their
wrongs
i
should
call
an
example
of
what
to
say
remarked
a
man
with
a
grin
the
crowd
were
ragging
the
speaker
again
while
she
shouted
are
going
to
effect
such
a
revolution
as
the
world
has
never
seen
like
to
bash
her
head
for
her
let
them
know
that
so
long
as
women
have
no
citizenship
they
are
outside
the
pale
of
the
law
if
we
are
outside
the
law
we
ca
the
law
it
is
not
our
fault
that
we
outlaws
it
is
you
men
fault
say
that
said
a
voice
in
mock
agony
love
you
so
know
you
ca
help
it
she
retorted
we
gave
you
the
vote
what
would
you
do
with
it
put
it
in
a
pie
i
would
make
the
of
it
you
men
do
and
she
turned
the
laugh
at
you
at
you
she
said
when
quiet
was
restored
the
young
revellers
gave
a
rather
blank
snigger
as
though
they
had
all
along
supposed
looking
at
them
to
be
an
exhilarating
occupation
for
any
young
woman
do
you
do
with
your
power
you
throw
it
away
you
submit
to
being
taxed
and
to
being
taxed
to
the
tune
of
a
hundred
and
millions
that
a
war
may
be
carried
on
in
south
africa
a
war
that
most
of
you
know
nothing
about
and
care
nothing
about
a
war
that
some
of
us
knew
only
too
much
about
and
wanted
only
to
see
abandoned
we
see
constantly
how
you
men
either
misuse
the
power
you
have
or
you
do
use
it
at
all
do
appreciate
it
do
know
what
to
do
with
it
have
a
notion
you
ought
to
be
turning
it
into
good
for
the
world
hundreds
of
men
do
care
anything
about
political
influence
except
that
women
should
have
it
she
was
getting
on
better
till
some
one
called
out
ought
to
get
married
going
to
if
you
do
be
good
you
wo
be
asked
to
the
wedding
before
the
temptation
of
a
retort
she
had
dropped
her
argument
and
encouraged
personalities
in
vain
she
tried
to
recover
that
thread
of
attention
which
not
her
interrupter
but
herself
had
snapped
she
retired
in
the
midst
of
uproar
the
chairman
came
forward
and
berated
the
crowd
for
its
behaviour
in
not
giving
a
speaker
a
fair
hearing
a
man
held
up
a
you
just
tell
me
one
thing
miss
now
when
the
last
speaker
has
finished
there
will
be
ten
minutes
for
questions
and
i
may
say
that
it
is
a
great
and
rare
pleasure
to
have
any
that
are
intelligent
do
waste
anything
so
precious
just
save
it
up
till
you
asked
for
it
i
want
you
now
to
give
a
fair
hearing
to
mrs
bewley
this
was
a
wizened
creature
of
about
fifty
in
rusty
black
widow
of
a
stonemason
and
mother
of
four
children
she
said
with
some
significance
she
added
her
mite
of
testimony
to
that
of
the
organized
women
of
the
mills
that
the
workers
in
her
way
of
life
realized
how
their
condition
and
that
of
the
children
would
be
improved
the
women
some
say
in
things
quite
certain
she
assured
the
people
ought
to
be
women
and
matrons
in
the
prisons
and
it
very
on
women
that
there
is
the
same
cheap
accommodation
fur
single
women
as
there
is
fur
single
men
it
very
on
poor
girls
worse
than
but
men
wo
never
change
that
we
women
got
to
do
it
and
get
your
tea
said
a
squeezing
her
way
into
the
throng
a
queer
little
woman
about
the
same
age
as
the
speaker
but
dressed
in
purple
silk
and
velvet
and
wearing
a
wonderful
purple
plush
hat
on
a
wig
of
sandy
curls
she
might
have
been
a
prosperous
milliner
from
the
commercial
road
and
she
had
a
meek
man
along
who
wore
the
husband
air
of
depressed
responsibility
she
was
spared
the
humiliating
knowledge
but
she
was
taken
at
first
for
a
sympathizer
with
the
cause
in
manners
she
was
precisely
like
what
the
suffragette
was
at
that
time
expected
to
be
pushing
her
way
through
the
crowd
and
vociferating
to
all
and
sundry
the
men
who
had
been
pleasantly
occupied
in
the
speaker
turned
and
glared
at
her
the
husband
had
an
air
of
not
observing
some
of
the
boys
pushed
and
harried
her
but
to
their
obvious
surprise
they
heard
her
advising
the
rusty
widow
and
get
your
tea
she
varied
that
advice
by
repeating
her
favourite
varied
by
beayviour
old
enough
to
know
better
every
good
wife
oughter
stay
at
and
darn
socks
and
make
comftubble
after
delivering
which
womanly
sentiment
she
would
nod
her
purple
plumes
and
smile
at
the
men
it
was
the
sorriest
travesty
of
similar
scenes
in
a
politer
world
to
the
credit
of
the
loafers
about
her
they
did
not
greatly
encourage
her
she
was
perhaps
overmature
for
her
but
they
ceased
to
jostle
her
they
even
allowed
her
to
get
in
front
of
them
the
tall
rusty
woman
in
the
cart
was
meanwhile
telling
a
story
of
personal
experience
of
the
operation
of
some
law
which
shut
out
from
any
share
in
the
benefits
of
the
new
act
which
regulates
the
feeding
of
school
children
the
very
people
most
in
need
of
it
for
it
appeared
that
orphans
and
the
children
of
widows
were
excluded
the
bill
provided
only
for
children
living
under
their
father
roof
if
the
roof
was
kept
over
them
by
the
shackled
hands
of
the
mother
according
to
the
speaker
they
might
go
hungry
no
miss
levering
shook
her
head
explaining
to
her
maid
doubt
the
poor
soul
has
had
some
difficulty
some
hard
experience
but
she
ca
be
quoting
the
law
correctly
nevertheless
in
the
halting
words
of
the
woman
who
had
suffered
if
only
from
misapprehension
upon
so
grave
a
point
there
was
a
rude
eloquence
that
overbore
the
lady
incredulity
the
crowd
hissed
such
gross
unfairness
women
made
the
laws
do
you
think
we
one
like
that
disgracin
the
no
and
in
all
sorts
o
ways
it
looks
like
the
law
seems
to
think
a
child
got
only
one
parent
i
like
to
tell
them
gentlemen
that
makes
the
laws
that
it
may
be
different
in
their
world
i
only
speak
for
my
little
corner
of
it
but
in
it
looks
like
when
a
child
got
only
one
parent
that
one
is
the
mother
let
up
old
gal
there
some
o
them
young
ones
ai
a
show
yet
time
you
had
a
rest
mother
the
mother
dies
she
was
saying
she
goes
to
heaven
to
the
pore
little
the
mother
dies
why
the
pore
little
home
is
sold
up
and
the
children
scattered
among
relations
or
sent
out
so
young
to
work
it
makes
yer
ache
but
if
a
man
dies
you
see
it
on
every
side
the
widow
takes
in
sewin
or
goes
out
charin
or
does
other
people
washin
as
well
as
own
or
she
mykes
boxes
er
ruther
that
makes
it
possible
fur
to
keep
together
you
do
see
the
mother
scatterin
the
little
family
the
only
parent
the
law
seems
to
reconize
is
dead
and
gone
i
say
a
been
sayin
it
for
a
good
while
you
must
be
needin
a
cup
tea
yerself
india
i
told
they
burn
the
widows
in
england
they
do
worse
than
that
they
keep
them
alive
the
crowd
rose
to
that
with
the
pinched
proof
before
their
eyes
enough
alive
to
suffer
through
their
children
and
so
the
women
round
about
where
i
live
that
they
say
if
we
in
this
country
let
give
up
ways
let
the
mothers
this
country
their
untied
we
willin
to
work
for
our
children
but
it
breaks
our
to
work
without
tools
the
tool
needin
is
the
tool
that
mends
the
laws
i
pleasure
in
the
resolution
with
nervously
twitching
lips
the
woman
sat
down
they
cheered
her
lustily
a
little
out
of
sympathy
a
good
deal
from
relief
that
she
had
finished
and
a
very
different
sort
of
person
was
being
introduced
by
the
chairman
chapter
ix
will
now
call
upon
the
last
speaker
yes
i
will
answer
any
general
questions
miss
ernestine
blunt
has
spoken
i
sy
miss
blunt
that
little
one
this
is
the
one
i
was
tellin
you
about
people
pushed
and
craned
their
necks
the
crowd
swayed
as
the
other
one
of
the
two
youngest
came
forward
she
had
been
sitting
very
quietly
in
her
corner
of
the
cart
looking
the
least
concerned
person
in
hyde
park
almost
dull
the
round
rather
pouting
face
with
the
vivid
scarlet
lips
almost
sleepy
the
eyes
but
when
she
had
taken
the
speaker
post
above
the
crowd
the
onlooker
wondered
why
he
had
not
noticed
her
before
it
seemed
probable
that
all
save
those
quite
new
to
the
scene
had
been
keeping
an
eye
on
this
person
who
despite
her
childish
look
was
plainly
no
new
recruit
her
demonstrated
that
as
abundantly
as
the
reception
she
got
the
vigorous
hoots
and
hoorays
in
the
midst
of
clapping
and
cries
your
mother
know
you
out
and
darn
your
stockens
a
disgryce
bet
on
little
blunt
even
in
that
portion
of
the
crowd
that
did
not
relieve
its
feelings
by
either
talking
or
shouting
there
was
observable
the
indefinable
something
that
says
the
real
fun
going
to
begin
you
see
the
same
sort
of
manifestation
in
the
playhouse
when
the
favourite
comedian
makes
his
entrance
he
may
have
come
on
quite
soberly
only
to
say
is
ready
but
the
grin
on
the
face
of
the
public
is
as
ready
as
the
tea
the
people
sit
forward
on
the
edge
of
their
seats
and
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
theatre
undergoes
some
subtle
change
so
it
was
here
and
yet
in
this
young
woman
was
the
most
complete
lack
of
any
dependence
upon
that
platform
ever
saw
her
little
manner
seemed
to
say
expect
me
to
encourage
you
in
any
nonsense
and
above
all
do
dare
to
presume
upon
my
youth
she
began
by
calling
on
the
government
to
save
the
need
of
further
demonstration
by
giving
the
women
of
the
country
some
speedy
measure
of
justice
have
to
give
it
to
us
in
the
end
they
might
just
as
well
do
it
gracefully
and
at
once
as
do
it
grudgingly
and
after
more
scenes
whereupon
loud
booing
testified
to
the
audience
horror
of
anything
approaching
unruly
behaviour
yes
you
are
scandalized
at
the
trouble
we
make
but
i
tell
you
a
secret
she
paused
and
collected
every
eye
and
ear
only
just
you
be
simply
if
you
knew
what
the
government
still
has
to
expect
from
us
if
they
do
give
us
what
we
asking
for
ai
she
just
sniggered
a
girl
with
dyed
hair
and
gorgeous
jewelry
the
men
laughed
and
shook
their
heads
she
just
was
they
crowded
nearer
better
take
care
there
a
policeman
with
eye
on
you
on
you
my
friends
he
got
his
eye
you
saw
a
little
while
ago
how
they
had
to
take
away
somebody
for
disturbing
our
meeting
it
a
woman
hear
police
are
our
friends
when
the
government
allows
them
to
be
the
other
day
when
there
was
that
scene
in
the
house
one
of
the
policemen
who
was
sent
up
to
clear
the
gallery
said
he
wished
the
members
would
come
and
do
their
own
dirty
work
they
hate
molesting
us
we
do
blame
the
police
we
put
the
blame
where
it
belongs
on
the
liberal
government
old
gettin
it
fur
the
see
at
last
it
taken
us
a
long
time
but
we
see
at
last
women
get
nothing
even
from
their
professed
political
friends
nothing
whatever
to
expect
by
waiting
and
being
what
called
ladylike
do
want
to
depreciate
the
work
of
preparation
the
older
the
ladylike
suffrage
women
did
but
we
came
at
last
to
see
that
all
that
was
possible
to
accomplish
that
way
had
been
done
the
cause
moved
an
inch
for
years
it
was
even
doing
the
other
thing
yes
it
was
going
backward
even
the
miserable
little
pettifogging
share
women
had
had
in
urban
and
borough
councils
even
that
they
were
deprived
of
and
they
were
tamely
submitting
women
who
had
been
splendid
workers
ten
years
ago
women
with
the
best
capacities
for
public
service
had
fallen
into
a
kind
of
apathy
they
were
utterly
disheartened
many
had
given
up
the
struggle
that
was
the
state
of
affairs
with
regard
to
suffrage
only
a
few
short
months
ago
we
looked
at
the
suffragists
who
had
grown
grey
in
petitioning
parliament
and
being
constitutional
and
ladylike
and
we
said
no
through
roars
of
laughter
and
indistinguishable
denunciation
certain
fragments
rose
clear
you
tried
being
a
public
nuisance
we
got
to
the
place
where
we
were
a
public
we
knew
we
were
getting
on
the
audience
screamed
began
to
feel
encouraged
a
very
hurricane
swept
the
crowd
perhaps
it
was
chiefly
at
the
gleam
of
eye
and
funny
little
wag
of
the
head
with
the
big
floppity
hat
that
made
the
people
roar
with
delight
when
things
got
to
that
point
even
the
worst
old
fogey
in
the
cabinet
name
we
are
merciful
we
withhold
the
name
she
smiled
significantly
while
the
crowd
yelled
the
very
fogeyest
of
them
all
you
think
might
have
rubbed
his
eyes
and
said
everybody
laughing
at
them
why
there
must
be
something
serious
at
the
bottom
of
this
but
no
the
members
of
the
present
government
rub
their
eyes
you
mean
the
prime
minister
for
the
through
the
cheering
you
heard
ernestine
saying
i
mean
the
prime
minister
the
prime
minister
between
you
and
me
is
as
good
a
suffragist
as
any
of
us
only
he
well
he
likes
his
comfort
does
the
prime
minister
when
ernestine
looked
like
that
the
crowd
roared
with
laughter
yet
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
that
when
she
herself
smiled
it
was
because
she
could
help
it
and
not
singularly
enough
because
of
any
dependence
she
placed
upon
the
value
of
dimples
as
an
asset
of
persuasion
what
she
seemed
to
be
after
was
to
stir
these
people
up
it
could
not
be
denied
that
she
knew
how
to
do
it
any
more
than
it
could
be
doubted
that
she
was
ignorant
of
how
large
a
part
in
her
success
was
played
by
a
peculiarly
amusing
and
provocative
personality
always
she
was
the
first
to
be
grave
again
if
you
noisy
young
men
can
manage
to
keep
quiet
for
a
minute
tell
you
a
little
about
our
tactics
she
said
obligingly
know
breakin
up
meetings
tactics
only
shows
you
do
understand
them
yet
now
i
explain
to
you
a
little
wind
had
sprung
up
and
ruffled
her
hair
it
blew
open
her
long
plain
coat
it
even
threatened
to
carry
away
her
foolish
flapping
hat
she
held
it
on
at
critical
moments
and
tilted
her
delicate
little
face
at
a
bewitching
angle
and
all
the
while
that
she
was
looking
so
fetching
she
was
briskly
trouncing
by
turns
the
liberal
party
and
the
delighted
crowd
the
man
of
the
long
moustachios
who
had
been
swept
to
the
other
side
of
the
monument
returned
to
his
old
inquiry
with
mounting
cheer
we
no
man
a
little
pity
on
us
miss
there
were
others
who
edged
nearer
narrowing
their
eyes
and
squaring
their
shoulders
as
much
as
to
say
we
just
trip
her
up
at
the
first
opportunity
a
very
black
cloud
miss
gorringe
had
whispered
several
minutes
before
a
big
raindrop
had
fallen
on
the
lady
upturned
face
as
gorringe
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
who
had
observed
the
overclouding
of
the
sky
so
she
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
to
think
it
mattered
much
but
one
by
one
like
some
species
of
enormous
black
umbrellas
blossomed
above
the
undergrowth
at
the
foot
of
the
monument
the
lady
of
the
purple
plumes
had
long
vanished
a
few
others
moved
off
head
turned
over
shoulder
as
if
doubtful
of
the
policy
of
leaving
while
ernestine
was
explaining
things
the
great
majority
turned
up
their
coat
collars
and
stood
their
ground
the
maid
hurriedly
produced
an
umbrella
and
held
it
over
the
lady
up
please
miss
cau
see
said
a
youth
behind
nothing
cloudy
about
ernestine
policy
independence
of
all
parties
and
organized
opposition
to
whatever
government
was
in
power
until
something
was
done
to
prove
it
that
friend
to
women
it
pretended
to
be
are
tired
of
being
lied
to
and
cheated
there
is
a
man
in
the
world
whose
promise
at
election
time
i
would
trust
it
struck
some
common
chord
in
the
gathering
they
roared
with
appreciation
partly
to
hear
that
baby
saying
it
not
one
she
repeated
stoutly
taking
the
raindrops
in
her
face
while
the
risen
wind
tugged
at
her
wide
hat
promise
us
heaven
and
earth
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
just
to
get
our
help
oh
we
are
old
hands
at
it
now
and
we
can
see
through
the
game
is
ha
ha
old
they
let
you
sit
up
for
supper
are
going
to
every
contested
election
from
this
on
yes
rain
or
shine
do
mind
find
they
always
have
us
to
reckon
with
and
we
are
least
impressed
any
more
when
a
candidate
tells
us
he
in
favour
of
woman
suffrage
we
say
oh
we
got
four
hundred
and
twenty
of
your
kind
already
oh
haw
did
you
say
that
to
by
name
she
held
up
to
scorn
the
candidates
who
had
given
every
reason
for
the
general
belief
that
they
were
indifferent
if
not
opposed
to
woman
suffrage
till
the
moment
came
for
contesting
a
seat
when
they
find
us
there
we
hear
it
keeps
them
awake
at
night
thinking
we
always
be
there
in
future
when
they
find
us
there
they
hold
up
their
little
white
flags
yes
and
they
say
oh
but
in
favour
of
votes
for
women
we
just
smile
the
damp
gathering
in
front
of
her
hallooed
and
when
they
protest
what
splendid
friends
of
the
suffrage
they
are
we
say
you
do
care
twopence
about
it
you
are
like
the
humbugs
who
are
there
in
the
house
of
commons
already
to
their
fyces
haw
haw
roars
and
booing
filled
the
air
know
for
many
of
us
helped
to
put
them
there
but
that
was
before
we
knew
any
better
again
once
more
that
wise
little
wag
of
the
head
while
the
people
shrieked
with
laughter
it
was
highly
refreshing
to
think
those
government
blokes
could
take
in
ernestine
only
the
very
young
or
the
very
foolish
who
will
ever
be
caught
that
way
again
she
assured
them
old
are
you
too
old
to
the
right
age
to
think
about
gettin
married
shouted
a
youth
haw
then
a
very
penetrating
voice
screamed
you
be
mine
and
that
started
off
several
others
though
the
interruptions
did
not
anger
nor
in
the
least
discompose
this
surprising
young
person
in
the
cart
so
far
at
least
as
could
be
seen
the
audience
looked
in
vain
for
her
to
give
the
notice
to
these
that
she
had
to
other
interruptions
it
began
to
be
plain
that
ready
as
she
was
to
take
straight
ball
from
anybody
in
the
crowd
she
discouraged
impertinence
by
dint
of
an
invincible
deafness
if
you
wanted
to
get
a
rise
out
of
ernestine
you
had
to
talk
about
her
policy
no
hint
in
her
of
the
cheap
smartness
that
had
wrecked
the
other
speaker
in
that
highly
original
place
for
such
manifestation
ernestine
offered
all
unconsciously
a
new
lesson
of
the
moral
value
that
may
lie
in
she
won
the
loutish
crowd
to
listen
to
her
on
her
own
terms
parties
she
was
saying
been
glad
enough
to
use
help
to
get
candidates
elected
we
been
quite
intelligent
enough
to
canvass
for
them
we
were
intelligent
enough
to
explain
to
the
ignorant
men
she
acknowledged
the
groans
by
saying
course
there
are
none
of
that
sort
here
but
elsewhere
there
are
such
things
as
ignorant
men
and
women
by
dozens
and
by
scores
are
sent
about
to
explain
to
them
why
they
should
vote
this
way
or
that
but
as
the
chairman
told
you
any
woman
who
does
that
kind
of
thing
in
the
future
is
a
very
poor
creature
she
deserves
no
sympathy
when
her
candidate
forgets
his
pledge
and
sneers
at
womanhood
in
the
house
if
we
put
ourselves
under
men
feet
we
must
to
be
trodden
on
we
come
to
think
it
time
women
should
give
up
the
attitude
that
why
we
determined
on
a
policy
of
independence
we
see
how
well
independence
has
worked
for
the
irish
party
we
see
what
a
power
in
the
house
even
the
little
labour
party
is
with
only
thirty
members
some
say
those
thirty
labour
members
lead
the
great
liberal
majority
by
the
nose
hear
they
began
to
cheer
lothian
scott
some
one
tossed
name
into
the
air
like
a
paper
balloon
it
was
kept
afloat
by
vigorous
puffings
of
the
human
breath
fur
joe
cheers
for
joe
and
it
looked
as
if
ernestine
had
lost
them
she
held
out
her
hands
for
silence
but
the
tumult
only
grew
a
moment
i
want
to
tell
you
men
here
a
friend
of
yours
he
a
but
he
looks
just
your
kind
give
him
a
hearing
she
strained
her
voice
to
overtop
the
din
a
i
thought
you
listen
to
a
liberal
he
asking
that
old
question
why
did
we
wait
till
the
liberals
came
in
why
did
we
worry
the
conservatives
when
they
were
in
power
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
woman
suffrage
cause
was
then
still
in
the
stage
of
mild
constitutional
propaganda
women
were
still
occupied
in
being
ladylike
and
trying
to
get
justice
by
deserving
it
now
wait
a
moment
she
stemmed
another
torrent
quiet
while
i
tell
you
something
you
men
have
taught
us
that
women
can
get
a
great
deal
by
coaxing
often
far
more
than
we
deserve
but
justice
is
one
of
the
things
that
ever
got
that
way
justice
has
to
be
fought
for
justice
has
to
be
won
howls
and
uproar
men
it
began
to
be
apparent
that
whenever
the
roaring
got
so
loud
that
it
threatened
to
drown
her
she
said
men
very
loud
and
then
gave
her
voice
a
rest
while
the
din
died
down
that
they
might
hear
what
else
the
irrepressible
ernestine
had
to
say
upon
that
absorbing
topic
men
discovered
years
ago
that
you
were
going
to
get
justice
just
by
deserving
it
or
even
by
being
men
so
when
you
got
tired
of
asking
politely
for
the
franchise
you
took
to
smashing
windows
and
burning
down
custom
houses
and
overturning
carriages
while
why
we
have
so
much
as
upset
a
curate
off
a
bicycle
others
might
laugh
not
ernestine
men
she
went
on
up
riots
in
the
streets
riots
where
people
lost
their
lives
it
may
have
to
come
to
that
with
us
but
the
government
may
as
well
know
that
if
women
political
freedom
has
to
be
bought
with
blood
we
can
pay
that
price
too
above
a
volley
of
boos
and
groans
she
went
on
we
are
opposed
to
violence
and
it
will
be
our
last
resort
we
are
leaving
none
of
the
more
civilized
ways
untried
we
publish
a
great
amount
of
literature
i
hope
you
are
all
buying
some
of
it
you
ca
understand
our
movement
unless
you
do
we
organize
branch
unions
and
we
hire
halls
we
got
the
somerset
hall
and
we
hope
you
all
come
and
bring
your
friends
we
have
very
interesting
debates
and
answer
questions
politely
she
made
her
point
to
laughter
do
leave
any
stone
unturned
because
there
are
people
who
do
buy
our
literature
and
who
do
realize
how
interesting
the
somerset
hall
debates
are
we
go
into
the
public
places
where
the
idle
and
the
foolish
that
man
just
over
there
where
they
may
point
and
laugh
and
make
their
poor
little
jokes
but
let
me
tell
you
we
never
hold
a
meeting
where
we
do
win
friends
to
our
cause
a
lot
of
you
who
are
jeering
and
interrupting
now
are
going
to
be
among
our
best
friends
the
intelligent
ones
are
going
to
be
on
our
side
above
the
laughter
a
rich
groggy
voice
was
heard
that
against
yer
are
all
drunk
miss
hiccup
do
mind
ernestine
just
gave
them
time
to
appreciate
that
and
then
went
on
and
women
were
never
meant
to
fight
except
side
by
side
been
told
by
one
of
the
other
speakers
how
the
men
suffer
by
the
women
more
and
more
underselling
them
in
the
labour
market
need
no
tellin
you
know
how
that
has
come
about
i
tell
you
it
come
about
through
your
keeping
the
women
out
of
your
unions
you
never
would
have
done
that
if
they
had
votes
you
saw
the
important
people
ignored
them
you
thought
it
was
safe
for
you
to
do
the
same
but
i
tell
you
it
safe
to
ignore
the
women
high
over
the
groans
and
laughter
the
voice
went
on
men
have
got
to
realize
that
if
our
battle
against
the
common
enemy
is
to
be
won
you
got
to
bring
the
women
into
line
to
become
of
chivalry
become
of
chivalry
she
retorted
and
no
one
seemed
to
have
an
answer
ready
but
the
crowd
fell
silent
like
people
determined
to
puzzle
out
a
conundrum
you
know
that
there
are
girls
and
women
in
this
very
city
who
are
working
early
and
late
for
rich
men
and
who
are
expected
by
those
same
employers
to
live
on
six
shillings
a
week
perhaps
i
wrong
in
saying
the
men
expect
the
women
to
live
on
that
it
may
be
they
that
no
girl
can
it
may
be
the
men
know
how
that
struggle
ends
but
do
they
care
do
bother
about
chivalry
yet
they
and
all
of
you
are
dreadfully
exercised
for
fear
having
a
vote
would
unsex
women
we
are
too
delicate
women
are
such
fragile
flowers
the
little
face
was
ablaze
with
scorn
saw
some
of
those
fragile
flowers
last
week
and
i
tell
you
where
not
a
very
good
place
for
gardening
it
was
a
back
street
in
liverpool
the
flowers
oh
the
contempt
with
which
she
loaded
the
innocent
word
flowers
looked
pretty
dusty
but
they
were
quite
dead
i
stood
and
looked
at
them
hundreds
of
worn
women
coming
down
steep
stairs
and
pouring
out
into
the
street
what
had
they
all
been
doing
there
in
that
garden
i
was
going
to
say
that
big
grimy
building
they
had
been
making
cigars
spending
the
best
years
of
their
lives
spending
all
their
youth
in
that
grim
dirty
street
making
cigars
for
men
whose
chivalry
prevents
that
why
were
they
coming
out
at
that
hour
of
the
day
because
their
poor
little
wages
were
going
to
be
lowered
and
with
the
courage
of
despair
they
were
going
on
strike
no
chivalry
prevents
men
from
getting
women
at
the
very
lowest
possible
wage
i
want
you
to
notice
the
low
wage
is
the
main
consideration
in
all
this
men
get
these
women
that
they
say
are
so
tender
and
delicate
to
undertake
the
almost
intolerable
toil
of
the
they
get
women
to
make
bricks
girls
are
driven
when
they
are
not
driven
to
worse
they
are
driven
to
being
slaveys
or
scullions
all
right
women
are
graciously
permitted
to
sweat
over
other
people
washing
when
they
should
be
caring
for
their
own
babies
in
birmingham
she
raised
the
clear
voice
and
bent
her
flushed
face
over
the
crowd
birmingham
those
same
fragile
flowers
make
bicycles
to
keep
alive
at
cradley
heath
we
make
chains
at
the
pit
brows
we
sort
coal
but
a
vote
would
soil
our
hands
you
may
wear
out
women
lives
in
factories
you
may
sweat
them
in
the
slums
you
may
drive
them
to
the
streets
you
but
a
vote
would
unsex
them
her
full
throat
choked
she
pressed
her
clenched
fist
against
her
chest
and
seemed
to
admonish
herself
that
emotion
was
her
line
you
are
intelligent
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
women
are
exploited
the
length
and
the
breadth
of
the
land
and
yet
you
come
talking
about
chivalry
now
i
just
tell
you
men
something
for
your
future
guidance
she
leaned
far
out
over
the
crowd
and
won
a
watchful
silence
talk
about
chivalry
makes
women
in
the
midst
of
the
roar
she
cried
they
may
always
show
it
for
women
have
had
to
learn
to
conceal
their
deepest
feelings
but
depend
on
it
how
they
feel
then
apparently
thinking
she
been
serious
enough
might
be
some
sense
in
talking
to
us
about
chivalry
if
you
paid
our
taxes
for
us
she
said
while
the
people
recovered
their
spirits
in
roaring
with
delight
at
the
coolness
of
that
suggestion
you
forgave
us
our
crimes
because
we
are
women
if
you
gave
annuities
to
the
women
out
of
every
hundred
in
this
country
who
are
slaving
to
earn
their
bread
many
of
them
having
to
provide
for
their
children
some
of
them
having
to
feed
sick
husbands
or
old
parents
but
chivalry
does
carry
you
men
as
far
as
that
no
no
further
than
the
door
you
hold
that
open
for
a
lady
and
then
expect
her
to
grovel
before
such
an
exhibition
of
we
do
need
it
thank
you
we
can
open
doors
for
ourselves
she
had
quite
recovered
her
and
it
looked
as
she
faced
the
wind
and
the
raindrops
as
if
she
were
going
to
wind
up
in
fighting
form
the
umbrellas
went
down
before
a
gleam
of
returning
sun
an
aged
woman
in
rusty
black
who
late
in
the
proceedings
had
timidly
adventured
a
little
way
into
the
crowd
stood
there
lost
and
wondering
she
had
peered
about
during
the
last
part
of
miss
speech
with
faded
incredulous
eyes
listened
to
a
sentence
or
two
and
then
turning
with
a
pathetic
little
nervous
laugh
of
apology
consulted
the
faces
of
the
lords
of
creation
when
the
speaker
was
warned
that
a
policeman
had
his
eye
on
her
the
little
old
woman
instant
solicitude
showed
that
the
dauntless
suffragist
had
both
touched
and
frightened
her
she
craned
forward
with
a
fluttering
anxiety
till
she
could
see
for
herself
yes
a
policeman
coming
slow
and
majestic
through
the
crowd
was
he
going
to
hale
the
girl
off
to
holloway
no
he
came
to
a
standstill
near
some
rowdy
boys
and
he
stared
straight
before
him
herculean
impassive
the
very
image
of
conscious
authority
whenever
ernestine
said
anything
particularly
dreadful
the
old
lady
craned
her
neck
to
see
how
the
policeman
was
taking
it
when
ernestine
fell
to
drubbing
the
government
the
old
lady
in
her
agitation
greatly
daring
squeezed
up
a
little
nearer
as
if
half
of
a
mind
to
try
to
placate
that
august
image
of
the
power
that
was
being
flouted
but
it
ended
only
in
trembling
and
furtive
watching
till
ernestine
reckless
scorn
at
the
idea
of
chivalry
moved
the
ancient
dame
faintly
to
admonish
the
girl
as
a
nurse
might
speak
to
a
wilful
child
and
then
furtively
trying
to
soothe
the
great
policeman
she
twittered
at
his
elbow
no
she
do
mean
it
when
ernestine
declared
that
women
could
open
doors
for
themselves
some
one
called
out
do
you
expect
to
be
a
quite
soon
she
answered
cheerfully
with
her
hat
rakishly
over
one
ear
while
the
boys
jeered
said
the
policeman
pawsed
law
examination
as
some
of
the
rowdiest
boys
naturally
surprised
at
this
interjection
looked
round
he
rubbed
it
in
better
than
the
men
he
assured
them
was
it
possible
that
this
dread
myrmidon
of
the
law
was
vaunting
the
prowess
of
the
small
rebel
miss
levering
moved
nearer
that
so
did
i
understand
you
with
a
surly
face
he
glanced
round
at
her
not
for
this
lady
benefit
had
the
admission
been
made
they
say
he
observed
with
an
assumption
of
indifference
quite
other
than
the
tone
in
which
he
had
betrayed
where
his
sympathies
in
spite
of
himself
really
were
well
well
there
were
all
kinds
even
of
people
who
looked
so
much
alike
as
policemen
now
the
crowd
with
him
and
miss
levering
as
sole
exceptions
were
dissolved
again
in
laughter
what
had
that
girl
been
saying
we
spectres
at
the
liberal
feast
and
we
becoming
inconveniently
numerous
we
got
friends
everywhere
up
and
down
the
country
we
go
organizing
do
you
go
in
a
pram
at
which
the
crowd
rocked
with
delight
the
only
person
who
had
heard
the
sally
you
would
say
was
the
orator
on
she
went
branches
and
carrying
forward
the
work
of
propaganda
you
people
in
london
stroll
about
with
your
hands
in
your
pockets
and
your
hats
on
the
back
of
your
heads
and
with
never
a
of
going
on
in
the
world
that
thinks
and
works
that
the
world
making
the
future
some
of
you
understand
it
so
little
you
think
all
that
we
tell
you
is
a
joke
just
as
the
governing
class
used
to
laugh
at
the
idea
of
a
labour
party
in
conservative
england
while
those
people
were
laughing
the
labour
men
were
at
work
they
talked
and
wrote
they
lectured
and
printed
and
distributed
and
organized
and
one
fine
day
there
was
a
general
election
to
everybody
astonishment
thirty
labour
men
were
returned
to
parliament
just
that
same
sort
of
thing
is
going
on
now
among
women
we
have
our
people
at
work
everywhere
and
let
me
tell
you
the
most
wonderful
part
of
it
all
is
to
discover
how
little
teaching
we
have
to
do
how
the
women
are
all
over
the
three
kingdoms
women
are
against
it
the
letters
in
the
papers
do
more
women
come
to
hear
you
if
they
so
in
favour
converted
do
need
to
come
it
you
who
need
to
come
above
roars
of
derision
felt
that
or
of
course
you
would
be
here
men
are
so
reasonable
as
to
the
women
who
write
letters
to
the
papers
to
say
they
against
the
suffrage
they
are
very
ignorant
those
ladies
or
else
it
may
be
they
write
their
foolish
letters
to
please
their
menfolk
some
of
them
i
know
think
the
end
and
aim
of
woman
is
to
please
i
do
blame
them
it
the
penalty
of
belonging
to
the
parasite
class
but
those
women
are
a
poor
little
handful
they
write
letters
to
prove
that
they
do
count
and
they
she
waved
them
away
with
one
slim
hand
one
reason
we
do
bother
much
with
holding
meetings
the
older
suffragists
have
been
holding
meetings
forty
she
brought
it
out
to
shouts
we
go
to
the
mill
gates
that
where
we
hold
our
meetings
we
hold
them
at
the
we
hold
them
everywhere
that
men
and
women
are
working
and
suffering
and
hoping
for
a
better
time
with
that
miss
ernestine
sat
down
they
applauded
her
lustily
they
revelled
in
laughing
praise
yielding
to
a
glow
that
they
imagined
to
be
pure
magnanimity
there
any
questions
miss
claxton
with
her
eyes
still
screwed
up
to
meet
the
returning
sun
and
the
volley
of
interrogatory
appeared
at
the
side
of
the
cart
one
at
a
time
please
what
i
ca
hear
when
you
all
talk
together
write
it
down
and
hand
it
to
me
now
you
people
who
are
nearer
what
very
well
here
a
man
who
wants
to
know
whether
if
women
had
the
vote
would
it
make
dissension
in
the
house
when
husband
and
wife
held
different
views
she
had
smiled
and
nodded
as
though
in
this
question
she
welcomed
an
old
friend
but
instead
of
answering
it
she
turned
to
the
opposite
side
and
looked
out
over
the
clamourers
on
the
left
they
were
engaged
for
the
most
part
in
inquiring
about
her
matrimonial
prospects
and
why
she
had
carried
that
something
in
her
face
made
them
fall
silent
for
it
was
both
and
expectant
even
intent
waiting
she
said
after
a
little
pause
every
meeting
we
hold
there
usually
another
question
put
at
the
same
time
as
that
first
one
about
the
quarrels
that
will
come
of
husbands
and
wives
holding
different
opinions
as
though
the
quarrelsome
ones
had
been
waiting
for
women
suffrage
before
they
fell
out
when
the
man
on
my
right
asks
would
they
quarrel
there
almost
always
another
man
on
my
left
who
says
if
women
were
enfranchised
we
would
be
an
inch
forrader
because
the
wife
would
vote
as
her
husband
told
her
to
the
man
vote
would
simply
be
duplicated
and
things
would
be
exactly
as
they
were
neither
objector
seems
to
see
that
the
one
scruple
cancels
the
other
but
to
the
question
put
this
afternoon
i
just
say
this
she
bent
forward
and
she
held
up
her
hand
the
end
of
time
there
be
people
who
wo
rest
till
they
found
something
to
quarrel
about
and
to
the
end
of
time
there
be
wives
who
follow
blindly
where
their
husbands
lead
and
to
the
end
of
time
there
be
husbands
who
are
influenced
by
their
wives
what
more
all
this
has
gone
on
ever
since
there
were
husbands
and
it
will
go
on
as
long
as
there
are
any
left
and
it
got
no
more
to
do
with
women
voting
than
it
has
with
their
making
cream
tarts
no
not
half
as
much
she
laughed
where
that
question
that
you
were
going
to
write
some
one
handed
up
a
wisp
of
white
paper
miss
claxton
opened
it
and
upon
the
subject
presented
she
embarked
with
the
promising
beginning
economics
are
pretty
wobbly
my
friend
and
proceeded
to
clear
the
matter
up
and
incidentally
to
flatten
out
the
man
one
wondered
that
under
such
auspices
time
was
as
popular
as
it
obviously
was
there
is
no
doubt
a
fearful
joy
in
adventuring
yourself
in
certain
danger
before
the
public
eye
besides
the
excitement
of
taking
a
personal
share
in
the
game
there
is
always
the
hope
that
it
may
have
been
reserved
to
you
to
stump
the
speaker
and
to
shine
before
the
multitude
a
gentleman
who
had
vainly
been
trying
to
get
her
to
hear
him
again
asked
something
in
a
hesitating
way
stumbling
and
going
back
to
recast
the
form
of
his
question
he
was
evidently
quite
in
earnest
but
either
unaccustomed
to
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
or
unnerved
to
find
himself
bandying
words
in
hyde
park
with
a
suffragette
so
when
he
stuck
fast
in
the
act
of
fashioning
his
phrases
miss
claxton
bent
in
the
direction
whence
the
voice
issued
and
said
briskly
obliging
need
go
on
i
know
the
rest
what
this
gentleman
is
trying
to
ask
is
and
although
no
denial
on
his
part
reached
the
public
ear
it
was
not
hard
to
imagine
him
seething
with
indignation
down
there
helpless
in
his
crowded
corner
while
the
facile
speaker
propounded
as
well
as
demolished
his
objection
to
her
and
all
her
works
one
last
question
let
us
have
it
can
you
pretend
that
women
want
the
vote
why
there
are
hardly
any
here
women
would
join
us
openly
but
for
fear
of
their
thousands
upon
thousands
of
women
feel
a
sympathy
with
this
movement
they
dare
not
show
of
women
do
want
the
vote
women
do
want
it
are
you
worrying
about
a
handful
who
think
because
they
have
been
trained
to
like
subservience
everybody
else
ought
to
like
subservience
too
the
very
existence
of
a
movement
like
this
is
a
thorn
in
their
sleek
sides
we
are
a
reproach
and
a
menace
to
such
women
but
this
is
a
movement
to
compel
anybody
to
vote
it
is
to
give
the
right
to
those
who
want
it
to
those
signatories
of
the
second
largest
petition
ever
laid
on
the
table
of
the
house
of
commons
to
the
textile
workers
to
the
women
who
went
last
month
in
deputation
to
the
prime
minister
and
who
represented
over
half
a
million
belonging
to
trades
unions
and
organized
societies
to
perhaps
more
than
all
to
the
unorganized
women
those
whose
voices
are
never
heard
in
public
as
bewley
told
you
they
are
beginning
to
want
it
the
women
who
are
made
to
work
over
hours
want
the
vote
to
compel
them
to
work
over
hours
is
illegal
but
who
troubles
to
see
that
laws
are
fairly
interpreted
for
the
unrepresented
i
know
a
factory
where
a
notice
went
up
yesterday
to
say
that
the
women
employed
there
will
be
required
to
work
twelve
hours
a
day
for
the
next
few
weeks
instead
of
starting
at
eight
they
must
begin
at
six
and
work
till
seven
the
hours
in
this
particular
case
are
illegal
as
the
employer
will
find
out
she
threw
in
with
a
flash
and
one
saw
by
that
illumination
the
avenue
through
which
his
enlightenment
would
come
in
many
shops
where
women
work
twelve
hours
a
day
is
legal
much
of
women
employment
is
absolutely
unrestricted
except
that
they
may
not
be
worked
on
sunday
and
while
all
that
is
going
on
comfortable
gentlemen
sit
in
armchairs
and
write
alarmist
articles
about
the
falling
and
the
horrible
amount
of
infant
mortality
a
government
calling
itself
liberal
goes
pettifogging
on
about
side
issues
while
women
are
debased
and
babies
die
here
and
there
we
find
a
man
who
realizes
that
the
main
concern
of
the
state
should
be
its
children
and
that
you
ca
get
worthy
citizens
where
the
mothers
are
sickly
and
enslaved
the
question
of
statecraft
rightly
considered
always
reaches
back
to
the
mother
that
state
is
most
prosperous
that
most
considers
her
no
state
that
forgets
her
can
survive
the
future
is
rooted
in
the
of
women
if
you
rob
the
women
your
children
and
your
children
children
pay
men
have
realized
it
your
boasted
logic
has
never
yet
reached
so
far
of
all
the
community
the
women
who
give
the
next
generation
birth
and
who
form
its
character
during
the
most
impressionable
years
of
its
life
of
all
the
community
these
mothers
now
or
mothers
to
be
ought
to
be
set
free
from
the
monstrous
burden
that
lies
on
the
shoulders
of
millions
of
women

want
to
see

endowed

miss

wheeling
round
again
upon
the

as
some
of
her
companions
began
to
get
down
out
of
the
cart
she
can
count

she
can
see
when

each
one
in

up

taken
she
made

chapter

jean
dunbarton
received
geoffrey
stonor
upon
his
entrance
into
freddy
with
a
charming
little
air
of
fluttered
responsibility
freddy
and
i
have
been
lunching
with
the
whyteleafes
she
had
to
go
afterwards
to
say
to
some
people
who
are
leaving
for
abroad
so
freddy
asked
me
to
turn
over
my
girls
club
to
your
cousin
sophia
you
given
to
good
works
too
he
interrupted
a
terribly
philanthropic
age
it
is
jean
smiled
as
she
went
on
with
her
explanation
it
was
her
sunday
sophia
like
an
angel
has
gone
to
the
club
and
i
here
to
explain
freddy
said
if
she
was
back
on
the
stroke
i
dare
say
i
a
trifle
early
it
was
a
theory
that
presented
fewer
difficulties
than
that
he
should
be
kept
waiting
was
to
beg
you
to
give
her
a
few
minutes
grace
in
any
case
instead
of
finding
a
seat
he
stood
looking
down
at
the
charming
face
his
indifference
to
mrs
freddy
precise
programme
lent
his
eyes
a
misleading
look
of
which
dashed
the
girl
obvious
excitement
over
the
encounter
see
he
had
said
slowly
what
he
saw
was
a
graceful
creature
of
medium
height
with
a
clear
colour
and
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
an
interest
as
eager
as
it
was
frank
what
the
eyes
saw
was
probably
some
glorified
version
of
stonor
straight
firm
features
a
little
blunt
which
lacked
that
semblance
of
animation
given
by
colour
and
seemed
to
scorn
to
make
up
for
it
by
any
mobility
of
expression
the
grey
eyes
set
somewhat
too
prominently
were
heavy
when
not
interested
and
the
claim
to
good
looks
which
nobody
had
dreamed
of
denying
seemed
to
rest
mainly
upon
the
lower
part
of
his
face
the
lips
perhaps
were
firmly
moulded
but
the
best
lines
were
those
curves
from
the
ear
to
the
quite
beautiful
chin
the
gloss
on
the
straight
hair
may
have
stood
to
the
barber
credit
but
only
health
could
keep
so
much
grace
still
in
the
carriage
of
a
figure
heavier
than
should
be
in
a
man
of
forty
one
who
without
a
struggle
had
declined
from
polo
unto
golf
there
was
no
denying
that
the
old
expression
of
incipient
sullenness
fleeting
or
suppressed
was
deepening
into
the
main
characteristic
of
his
face
though
it
was
held
that
he
as
little
as
any
man
had
cause
to
present
that
aspect
to
a
world
content
to
be
his
oyster
yet
as
no
doubt
he
had
long
ago
learned
it
was
that
very
expression
which
was
the
cause
of
much
of
the
general
concern
people
seemed
to
feel
to
placate
to
amuse
to
dispel
the
menace
of
that
cloud
the
girl
saw
it
and
her
heart
failed
her
freddy
said
if
i
told
you
the
children
were
in
the
garden
expecting
you
you
would
have
the
heart
to
go
away
directly
is
right
i
the
heart
and
in
that
lifting
of
his
cloud
the
girl
own
face
shone
an
instant
should
have
felt
it
a
terrible
responsibility
if
you
were
to
go
she
spoke
as
if
the
gladness
that
was
not
to
be
repressed
called
for
some
explanation
freddy
says
that
she
and
freddy
see
so
little
of
you
nowadays
that
was
why
she
made
such
a
point
of
my
coming
and
trying
to
to
needed
a
great
deal
of
urging
then
he
betrayed
the
surprise
of
the
man
accustomed
to
find
people
ready
enough
as
a
rule
to
clutch
at
excuse
for
a
although
she
had
flushed
with
mingled
embarrassment
and
excitement
he
proceeded
to
increase
her
perturbation
by
suggesting
freddy
had
to
overcome
your
dislike
for
the
mission
oh
no
then
well
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
dared
to
look
him
full
in
the
face
as
she
said
suppose
you
know
you
are
rather
alarming
i
he
smiled
people
less
interested
in
him
than
jean
were
grateful
to
geoffrey
stonor
when
he
smiled
they
felt
relieved
from
some
intangible
responsibility
for
the
order
of
the
universe
the
girl
brightened
wonderfully
yes
very
alarming
indeed
she
assured
him
cheerfully
do
you
make
that
out
do
need
to
make
it
out
it
so
very
plain
then
a
little
hastily
as
if
afraid
of
having
said
something
that
sounded
like
impious
alarming
who
is
so
so
much
talked
about
and
so
well
like
you
you
understand
do
understand
he
objected
mendaciously
a
little
bit
think
you
must
she
said
with
her
candid
air
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
be
afraid
of
you
any
more
since
our
at
ulland
that
better
there
was
nothing
in
the
words
but
in
the
gentleness
with
which
he
brought
them
out
so
much
that
the
girl
turned
her
eyes
away
and
played
with
the
handle
of
her
parasol
you
been
reading
any
more
poetry
he
said
why
not
she
shook
her
head
does
sound
the
same
i
spoilt
it
for
you
she
laughed
and
again
she
shook
her
head
but
with
something
shy
in
her
look
nervously
she
dashed
at
a
diversion
afraid
i
was
a
little
misleading
about
the
children
they
are
in
the
garden
yet
shall
we
go
up
and
see
them
having
tea
no
it
would
be
bad
for
their
little
digestions
to
hurry
them
he
sat
down
her
face
gave
him
as
much
credit
as
though
he
had
done
some
fine
deed
they
spoke
of
that
sunday
walk
in
the
valley
below
the
ulland
links
and
the
crossing
of
a
swollen
little
stream
on
a
rotting
and
rickety
log
to
go
she
explained
apologetically
had
gone
on
and
forgotten
the
puppy
had
learnt
to
follow
i
was
afraid
he
lose
himself
a
dangerous
place
to
go
across
he
said
as
if
to
justify
some
past
opinion
her
eyes
were
a
little
mischievous
never
thought
come
he
demanded
because
i
thought
you
be
too
his
slow
look
quickened
as
if
to
surprise
in
her
some
reflection
upon
his
too
solid
flesh
or
might
it
even
be
upon
the
weight
of
years
but
the
uncritical
admiration
in
her
face
must
have
reassured
him
before
the
words
thought
you
be
too
grand
it
was
delightful
to
find
you
were
he
kept
his
eyes
on
her
you
always
so
happy
i
hope
not
that
would
be
rather
too
inhuman
would
it
celestial
perhaps
he
laughed
but
he
was
looking
into
the
blue
of
her
eyes
as
if
through
them
he
too
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
paradise
remember
thinking
at
ulland
he
said
more
slowly
again
had
never
seen
any
one
quite
so
happy
was
happy
at
ulland
but
i
not
happy
now
your
looks
belie
you
i
am
very
sad
i
have
to
go
away
from
this
delightful
london
to
scotland
i
shall
be
away
for
weeks
it
too
dismal
do
you
go
grandfather
makes
me
he
hates
london
and
his
dreary
old
house
on
a
horrible
windy
hill
he
simply
loves
that
you
do
love
it
i
see
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
out
something
compunction
visited
the
face
before
him
did
mean
to
say
i
love
it
it
like
those
people
you
care
to
be
with
for
a
little
while
but
if
you
must
go
being
with
them
for
ever
you
come
to
hate
them
almost
they
sat
silent
for
a
moment
then
with
slow
reflectiveness
like
one
who
thinks
aloud
he
said
have
to
go
to
scotland
next
week
you
what
part
go
to
that
where
we
are
near
should
i
drop
down
upon
you
some
day
you
that
would
be
she
seemed
to
save
herself
from
some
gulf
of
betrayal
are
walks
about
my
grandfather
more
beautiful
than
anything
you
ever
saw
or
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
more
beautiful
than
anything
ever
saw
walks
than
at
ulland
no
comparison
one
is
a
all
along
a
wonderful
brown
trout
stream
that
goes
racing
down
our
hill
there
a
moor
on
one
side
and
a
wood
on
the
other
and
a
peat
bog
at
the
bottom
might
perhaps
stop
short
of
the
bog
we
stop
at
old
mctaggart
he
the
and
a
real
friend
mctaggart
has
the
gaelic
but
he
has
much
else
so
perhaps
you
prefer
his
wife
should
i
prefer
his
wife
jean
face
was
full
of
laughter
stonor
plan
of
going
to
scotland
had
singularly
altered
the
character
of
that
country
its
very
inhabitants
were
now
perceived
to
be
enlivening
even
to
talk
about
to
the
gamekeeper
wife
alone
would
repay
the
journey
thither
assure
you
mctaggart
is
a
travelled
experienced
person
he
shook
his
head
while
he
humoured
her
not
sure
travel
or
experience
is
what
we
chiefly
prize
in
ladies
is
it
i
did
know
you
see
i
did
know
how
dreadfully
you
might
miss
the
terribly
clever
people
you
accustomed
to
in
london
because
of
the
terribly
clever
people
we
are
glad
to
go
away
he
waxed
so
eloquent
in
his
admiration
of
the
womanly
woman
who
seemed
by
implication
to
have
steered
clear
of
mctaggart
pitfalls
that
jean
asked
with
dancing
eyes
you
consoling
me
for
not
being
clever
you
sure
you
are
dear
yes
no
possible
shadow
of
doubt
about
it
he
laughed
coming
to
i
even
go
so
far
as
to
call
on
the
mctaggarts
if
you
undertake
that
she
wo
instruct
me
about
foreign
lands
such
irrelevance
she
tell
you
about
london
she
was
here
for
six
whole
months
and
she
got
something
out
of
it
i
do
believe
even
you
have
a
certificate
of
merit
london
certainly
never
gave
me
one
see
mctaggart
lived
the
life
of
the
metropolis
with
such
success
that
she
passed
an
examination
before
she
left
the
subject
was
incidents
in
the
life
of
abraham
it
says
so
on
the
certificate
she
has
it
framed
and
hung
in
the
parlour
he
smiled
admit
few
can
point
to
such
fruits
of
metropolitan
ausbildung
but
i
think
i
shall
prefer
the
burnside
or
even
the
bog
the
moors
they
best
of
all
she
sat
looking
straight
before
her
with
her
heart
deep
well
overflowing
at
her
eyes
as
if
she
felt
vaguely
that
some
sober
reason
must
be
found
for
seeing
those
same
moors
in
this
glorified
light
all
of
a
sudden
she
went
on
show
you
a
special
place
where
white
heather
grows
and
the
rabbits
tumble
about
as
tame
as
kittens
it
miles
away
from
the
sea
but
the
gulls
come
sunning
themselves
and
walking
about
like
pigeons
i
used
to
hide
up
there
when
i
was
little
and
naughty
nobody
ever
found
the
place
out
except
an
old
gaberlunzie
and
i
gave
him
tuppence
not
to
tell
show
me
that
place
his
face
was
wonderfully
attractive
so
we
take
the
earthly
william
morris
along
wo
we
thought
you
given
up
reading
poetry
to
myself
i
used
to
think
i
knew
about
poetry
yes
better
than
anybody
but
the
poets
there
are
people
as
arrogant
as
that
it
worse
than
mrs
mctaggart
the
girl
was
grave
even
tremulous
no
i
never
had
a
notion
of
what
poetry
really
was
till
down
at
ulland
you
took
my
book
away
from
me
and
read
aloud
freddy
let
himself
and
lord
borrodaile
in
at
the
front
door
so
closely
on
the
heels
of
freddy
that
the
servant
who
had
closed
the
door
behind
her
had
not
yet
vanished
into
the
lower
regions
at
a
word
from
that
functionary
freddy
left
his
brother
depositing
hat
and
stick
with
the
usual
deliberation
and
himself
ran
upstairs
two
steps
at
a
time
he
caught
up
with
his
wife
just
outside
the
door
as
she
paused
to
take
off
her
veil
in
front
of
that
mirror
which
freddy
said
should
be
placed
between
the
front
door
and
the
in
every
house
in
the
land
for
the
reassurance
of
the
timid
feminine
creature
she
was
known
to
add
privately
that
it
was
not
ignored
by
men
and
that
those
who
came
often
contracted
a
habit
of
hurrying
upstairs
close
at
the
servant
heels
in
order
to
have
two
seconds
to
spare
for
furtive
consultation
while
he
went
on
to
open
the
door
she
had
observed
this
pantomime
more
than
once
leaning
over
the
banisters
herself
on
the
way
downstairs
tell
me
stonor
been
here
half
an
hour
said
freddy
breathlessly
dreadfully
late
darling
he
held
out
his
watch
to
confound
her
tell
me
you
are
late
no
i
do
so
sympathize
with
a
girl
who
has
no
mother
with
which
enigmatic
rejoinder
she
pushed
open
the
door
and
went
briskly
through
the
double
to
where
geoffrey
stonor
and
jean
dunbarton
were
sitting
by
a
window
that
overlooked
the
square
stonor
waved
away
freddy
shower
of
excuses
saying
come
just
in
time
to
save
us
from
falling
out
i
been
telling
miss
dunbarton
that
in
another
age
she
would
have
been
a
sort
of
dinah
morris
or
more
likely
another
ursula
with
a
train
of
seven
thousand
virgins
all
because
i
told
him
about
my
girls
club
and
he
said
and
he
turned
away
and
shook
hands
with
his
two
kinsmen
he
sat
talking
to
them
with
his
back
to
the
girl
it
was
a
study
in
those
delicate
weights
and
measures
that
go
to
estimating
the
least
tangible
things
in
personality
to
note
how
his
action
seemed
not
only
to
dim
her
vividness
but
actually
to
efface
the
girl
in
the
first
moments
she
herself
accepted
it
at
that
her
looks
said
he
is
not
aware
of
me
any
more
ergo
i
do
exist
during
the
slight
distraction
incident
to
the
bringing
in
of
tea
and
freddy
pushing
up
some
of
the
big
chairs
stonor
had
a
moment
remembrance
of
her
he
spoke
of
his
scottish
plans
and
fell
to
considering
dates
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
saw
that
again
and
yet
more
woundingly
his
attention
had
wandered
the
moment
came
while
lord
borrodaile
was
busy
russianizing
a
cup
of
tea
and
freddy
balancing
himself
on
very
legs
in
front
of
his
wife
had
interrogated
her
do
you
think
shall
i
ring
and
say
we
are
at
home
it
would
be
freddy
eye
flying
back
from
stonor
caught
her
she
arrested
her
husband
as
he
was
making
for
the
bell
except
to
miss
levering
right
except
to
miss
levering
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
jean
saw
she
was
being
listened
to
even
freddy
looking
up
was
conscious
of
something
in
face
that
made
her
say
sir
hervey
youngest
daughter
you
knew
i
suppose
even
if
you
have
met
her
jean
you
are
giving
stonor
anything
to
eat
no
thanks
i
do
know
why
i
took
this
he
set
down
his
never
have
tea
like
everybody
else
said
the
girl
in
a
aside
nobody
have
tea
she
lowered
her
voice
while
the
others
discussed
who
had
already
been
sent
away
and
who
might
still
be
expected
to
invade
remembers
anybody
else
when
that
miss
levering
of
theirs
is
to
the
fore
you
began
to
say
when
to
talk
about
scotland
he
had
taken
out
his
watch
was
wondering
if
the
children
were
down
yet
shall
we
go
and
see
jean
jumped
up
with
alacrity
freddy
held
up
a
finger
and
silenced
her
little
circle
must
have
thought
i
was
ringing
for
toast
somebody
being
let
in
hope
it
miss
levering
said
freddy
must
see
those
young
barbarians
of
yours
before
i
go
said
stonor
rising
with
decision
the
sound
of
voices
on
the
stair
was
quite
distinct
now
by
the
time
the
servant
had
opened
the
door
and
announced
heriot
miss
heriot
captain
beeching
freddy
the
usually
gracious
host
was
leading
the
way
through
the
back
unblushingly
abetting
stonor
escape
under
the
very
eyes
of
persons
who
would
have
gone
miles
on
the
chance
of
meeting
him
small
wonder
that
jean
was
consoled
for
knowing
herself
too
shy
to
follow
if
she
remembered
that
he
had
actually
asked
her
to
do
so
she
showed
no
surprise
at
the
tacit
assumption
on
the
part
of
his
relations
that
geoffrey
stonor
could
never
be
expected
to
sit
there
as
common
mortals
might
making
himself
more
or
less
agreeable
to
whoever
might
chance
to
drop
in
unless
they
were
special
of
course
he
be
expected
to
put
up
with
them
but
what
on
earth
was
happening
no
wonder
freddy
looked
aghast
for
heriot
had
had
the
temerity
to
execute
a
short
cut
and
waylay
the
escaping
lion
how
do
you
do
she
thrust
out
a
hand
and
he
went
out
as
if
she
had
been
thin
air
it
was
the
kind
of
insolence
that
used
to
be
more
common
because
safer
than
it
is
likely
to
be
in
future
a
form
of
condoned
brutality
that
used
to
inspire
more
awe
than
disgust
people
were
guilty
even
of
a
slavish
admiration
of
those
who
had
the
nerve
to
administer
this
wholly
disproportionate
reproof
to
the
merely
maladroit
it
could
be
done
only
by
one
whom
all
the
world
had
conspired
to
befog
and
befool
about
his
importance
in
the
scheme
of
things
small
wonder
the
girl
too
was
bewildered
for
no
one
seemed
to
dream
of
resenting
what
had
occurred
the
lesson
conveyed
appeared
to
be
that
the
proper
attitude
to
certain
of
your
was
very
much
the
traditional
one
towards
royalty
you
were
not
to
speak
unless
you
were
spoken
to
and
yet
this
man
who
with
impunity
snubbed
persons
of
consideration
was
the
same
one
who
was
coming
to
call
on
sally
mctaggart
he
was
going
to
walk
the
along
the
burnside
to
the
white
heather
haven
with
the
dazed
look
in
her
eyes
and
cheeks
scarlet
with
sympathy
and
confusion
the
girl
had
run
forward
to
greet
her
aunt
and
to
do
her
little
share
toward
dissipating
the
awkward
chill
that
had
fallen
on
the
company
after
producing
a
stammered
a
i
thought
it
was
the
immediate
effect
on
heriot
was
to
make
her
both
furious
and
cowed
though
a
nervous
stream
of
talk
trickled
on
freddy
face
did
not
lose
its
flustered
look
nor
did
the
company
regain
its
ease
until
a
further
diversion
was
created
by
the
appearance
of
miss
levering
with
an
alert
man
of
in
her
train
greatorex
was
passing
just
in
time
to
help
me
out
of
my
hansom
was
her
greeting
to
freddy
i
said
the
gentleman
on
being
further
rewarded
by
being
brought
in
is
miss
levering
whispered
jean
partly
to
distract
her
aunt
why
not
said
lord
borrodaile
overhearing
i
somehow
imagined
her
different
different
said
aunt
lydia
with
bitter
gloom
would
never
know
in
the
least
what
she
was
like
from
the
look
of
her
lord
borrodaile
eyes
twinkled
that
so
he
said
indulgent
to
a
mood
which
hardly
perhaps
made
for
dispassionate
appraisement
do
believe
it
said
heriot
course
not
was
only
thinking
what
a
fillip
it
gave
acquaintance
to
be
in
doubt
whether
a
person
was
a
sinner
or
a
saint
would
for
me
said
jean
you
see
you
so
scotch
he
was
incorrigible
did
hear
who
is
the
man
jean
asked
as
those
not
knowing
usually
did
although
far
from
distinguished
in
appearance
greatorex
would
have
stood
in
no
danger
of
being
overlooked
even
if
he
had
not
those
twinkling
eyes
and
two
strands
of
hair
trained
across
his
large
bumpy
cranium
from
the
left
ear
to
the
right
and
securely
pasted
there
that
wretched
radical
john
greatorex
heriot
turned
from
her
niece
to
lord
borrodaile
foundation
is
there
she
demanded
the
rumour
that
he
tells
such
good
stories
at
dinner
never
heard
any
i
believe
he
keeps
them
till
the
ladies
have
left
the
room
do
like
him
either
said
heriot
reaching
out
for
the
balm
of
alliance
with
lord
borrodaile
but
he
held
aloof
they
say
he
has
his
points
a
good
judge
of
wine
and
knows
more
about
parliamentary
procedure
than
most
of
us
you
men
stand
up
for
one
another
you
know
perfectly
well
you
endure
him
heriot
jerked
her
head
away
and
faced
the
group
round
the
is
she
saying
that
she
been
to
a
suffrage
meeting
in
hyde
park
could
she
nothing
would
induce
me
to
go
and
listen
to
such
people
said
miss
dunbarton
her
eyes
as
well
as
heriot
were
riveted
on
the
tall
figure
in
hand
moving
away
from
the
table
now
to
make
room
for
some
new
arrivals
and
drawing
after
her
a
portion
of
the
company
including
lady
whyteleafe
and
richard
farnborough
who
one
after
another
had
come
in
a
few
moments
before
it
was
to
the
young
man
that
greatorex
was
saying
with
a
twinkle
am
sure
farnborough
agrees
with
me
slightly
he
replied
miss
levering
being
too
a
that
sort
of
thing
altogether
too
do
you
know
said
the
lady
herself
with
a
teasing
smile
greatorex
started
out
of
the
chair
in
which
he
had
just
deposited
himself
at
her
side
bless
my
soul
he
said
only
saying
that
to
get
a
rise
out
of
you
farnborough
seemed
unable
to
bear
the
momentary
shadow
obscuring
the
lady
brightness
yes
greatorex
leaned
back
again
frocks
are
serious
enough
i
been
telling
you
it
an
exploded
notion
that
the
suffrage
people
are
all
dowdy
and
dull
said
greatorex
talk
about
some
of
them
being
pretty
farnborough
said
did
see
a
one
among
you
men
are
so
unsophisticated
you
missed
the
fine
feathers
o
feathers
on
the
one
i
heard
but
not
feathers
a
man
judges
of
the
general
effect
we
can
at
a
pinch
see
past
unbecoming
clothes
ca
we
lady
whyteleafe
we
see
what
women
could
make
of
themselves
if
they
took
the
trouble
the
same
said
the
lady
appealed
to
odd
they
do
see
how
much
better
policy
it
would
be
if
they
take
a
little
trouble
about
their
looks
now
if
we
got
our
maids
to
do
those
women
hair
for
them
if
we
lent
them
our
french
hats
ah
lady
whyteleafe
nodded
till
the
pearls
in
her
ears
swung
out
like
bells
ringing
an
alarum
convert
you
creatures
fast
enough
then
convert
is
hardly
the
word
said
vida
with
ironic
mouth
as
though
on
an
impulse
she
bent
forward
to
say
with
her
lips
near
lady
whyteleafe
pearl
drop
if
it
the
aim
of
the
movement
to
get
away
from
the
need
of
just
these
little
dodges
but
without
the
exclamation
miss
levering
must
have
seen
that
she
had
been
speaking
in
an
unknown
tongue
a
world
where
beauty
exists
for
beauty
sake
which
is
love
sake
and
not
for
tricking
money
or
power
out
of
men
even
the
possibility
of
such
a
world
is
beyond
the
imagining
of
many
something
was
said
about
a
deputation
of
women
who
had
waited
on
greatorex
yes
yes
he
fiddled
with
his
watch
chain
as
though
she
had
just
recalled
the
circumstances
yes
vida
said
remember
i
thought
at
the
time
in
my
modest
way
it
was
nothing
short
of
heroic
of
them
to
go
asking
audience
of
their
arch
opponent
did
come
off
he
wagged
his
strange
head
she
said
innocently
thought
they
insisted
on
bearding
the
lion
in
his
den
course
i
was
going
to
be
bothered
with
a
lot
of
do
mean
you
refused
to
go
out
and
face
them
he
put
on
a
comic
look
of
terror
would
have
done
it
for
worlds
but
a
friend
of
mine
went
and
had
a
look
at
she
laughed
he
get
back
alive
but
he
advised
me
not
to
go
you
quite
right
he
said
you
think
of
bothering
he
said
i
looked
over
the
lot
he
said
and
there
is
a
among
upon
the
general
laugh
that
drew
hermione
and
captain
beeching
into
the
group
jean
precipitated
herself
gaily
into
the
conversation
they
told
you
about
freddy
friend
who
came
to
tea
here
in
the
winter
she
asked
hermione
was
a
member
of
parliament
too
quite
a
little
young
one
he
said
women
would
never
be
respected
till
they
had
the
vote
greatorex
snorted
the
other
men
smiled
and
all
the
women
except
aunt
lydia
did
the
same
remember
telling
him
heriot
said
with
marked
severity
he
was
too
young
to
know
what
he
was
talking
about
i
afraid
you
all
sat
on
the
poor
gentleman
said
lord
borrodaile
was
such
fun
he
was
flat
as
a
pancake
when
we
done
with
him
aunt
ellen
was
here
she
told
him
with
her
most
distinguished
air
she
want
to
be
respected
lady
john
murmured
miss
levering
can
hear
her
right
said
captain
beeching
idea
to
think
revolting
agreed
miss
heriot
little
man
laughed
jean
he
thought
he
was
being
agreeable
of
which
it
was
you
miss
levering
said
the
curious
words
quite
pleasantly
but
so
low
that
only
jean
heard
them
the
girl
looked
up
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
you
had
made
yourself
immensely
popular
with
all
other
men
the
girl
flushed
hope
you
do
think
i
did
it
for
that
reason
the
little
passage
was
unnoticed
by
the
rest
of
the
company
who
were
listening
to
lord
borrodaile
contented
pronouncement
afraid
the
seed
falls
on
barren
ground
in
our
gardens
my
charming
greatorex
turned
sharply
tunbridge
god
bless
my
soul
you
mean
is
one
thing
i
will
say
for
her
freddy
lazily
defended
the
honour
of
the
house
does
as
a
rule
obtrude
her
opinions
there
are
people
who
have
known
her
for
years
and
have
a
notion
she
a
light
among
the
misguided
but
greatorex
was
not
to
be
reassured
tunbridge
lord
the
perils
that
beset
the
feet
of
man
he
got
up
with
a
ill
humour
not
going
the
hostess
flitted
over
to
remonstrate
had
a
word
with
you
yes
i
going
freddy
looked
bewildered
at
the
general
laugh
heard
aspersions
cast
upon
your
character
said
lord
borrodaile
moral
sense
is
shocked
tunbridge
farnborough
was
for
giving
her
a
chance
to
clear
herself
do
you
think
of
your
friends
recent
exploits
friends
the
disorderly
women
are
not
my
friends
said
freddy
with
dignity
i
think
you
must
call
them
not
said
lord
borrodaile
can
forgive
them
for
worrying
the
liberals
he
threw
a
laughing
glance
at
greatorex
they
disorderly
the
phrase
consecrated
to
a
different
class
said
miss
levering
quietly
perfectly
right
greatorex
for
once
was
at
one
with
lord
borrodaile
become
nothing
less
than
a
public
nuisance
going
about
with
and
spitting
in
policemen
faces
wonder
said
freddy
with
a
harassed
air
wonder
if
they
did
spit
course
they
did
greatorex
exulted
no
authority
on
what
they
do
said
freddy
run
away
away
he
turned
the
laugh
by
precipitately
backing
away
from
her
in
a
couple
of
agitated
steps
and
if
ever
i
muster
up
courage
to
come
back
it
will
be
to
vote
for
better
manners
in
public
life
not
worse
than
we
have
already
should
i
observed
freddy
meekly
think
i
defended
the
suffragettes
still
said
miss
levering
with
a
faint
accent
of
impatience
an
advocate
for
the
suffrage
are
you
do
beat
the
air
policemen
greatorex
mocked
you
cared
to
know
the
attitude
of
the
real
workers
in
the
reform
freddy
said
plaintively
might
have
seen
in
any
paper
that
we
lost
no
time
in
dissociating
ourselves
from
the
two
or
three
hysterical
she
caught
her
critical
eye
and
instantly
checked
her
flow
of
words
there
was
a
general
movement
as
greatorex
made
his
heriot
signalled
her
daughter
in
the
absence
of
the
master
lord
borrodaile
made
ready
to
do
the
honours
of
the
house
to
a
lady
who
had
had
so
little
profit
of
her
visit
beeching
carried
off
the
reluctant
farnborough
freddy
kept
up
her
spirits
until
after
the
exodus
then
with
a
sigh
she
sat
down
beside
vida
true
what
that
old
cynic
says
she
admitted
sorrowfully
scene
has
put
back
the
reform
a
generation
must
have
been
awfully
exciting
i
wish
i
been
there
said
jean
there
was
it
as
bad
as
the
papers
said
i
never
been
so
moved
in
public
no
tragedy
no
great
opera
ever
gripped
an
audience
as
the
situation
in
the
house
did
that
night
there
we
all
sat
breathless
with
everything
more
favourable
to
us
than
it
had
been
within
the
memory
of
woman
another
five
minutes
and
the
resolution
would
have
passed
then
all
in
a
moment
freddy
clasped
her
hands
excitedly
in
a
moment
a
horrible
dingy
little
flag
was
poked
through
the
grille
of
the
woman
gallery
cries
insults
scuffling
the
police
the
ignominious
turning
out
of
the
women
as
well
as
the
oh
i
ca
of
it
without
she
jumped
up
and
walked
to
and
fro
the
next
morning
she
paused
people
gloating
our
friends
antagonized
people
who
were
wavering
nearly
won
over
all
thrown
back
even
my
husband
freddy
been
an
angel
about
letting
me
take
my
share
when
i
felt
i
must
but
of
course
i
always
known
he
does
like
it
it
makes
him
shy
i
sure
it
gives
him
a
horrid
twist
inside
when
he
sees
even
the
discreetest
little
paragraph
to
say
that
i
am
one
of
the
speakers
but
he
always
been
an
angel
about
it
before
this
after
the
disgraceful
scene
he
said
it
just
shows
how
unfit
women
are
for
any
sort
of
coherent
thinking
or
concerted
action
think
said
jean
more
sympathetically
it
should
be
women
who
given
their
own
scheme
the
worst
blow
it
ever
had
work
of
forty
years
destroyed
in
five
minutes
must
have
felt
pretty
sick
said
the
girl
they
waked
up
the
next
morning
those
suffragettes
do
waste
any
sympathy
on
i
thinking
of
the
penalty
women
have
to
pay
because
two
or
three
hysterical
i
think
i
sorry
for
them
the
girl
persisted
must
be
dreadful
to
find
you
done
such
a
lot
of
harm
to
the
thing
you
care
most
about
in
the
world
you
picture
the
suffragettes
sitting
in
said
vida
speaking
at
last
they
ca
help
realizing
what
they
done
it
just
possible
they
realize
they
waked
up
interest
in
the
woman
question
so
that
it
advertised
in
every
paper
and
discussed
under
every
roof
from
land
end
to
do
you
think
know
there
been
more
said
and
written
about
it
in
these
days
since
the
scene
than
in
the
ten
years
before
it
are
saying
you
think
it
was
a
good
way
to
get
what
they
wanted
exclaimed
freddy
only
pointing
out
that
it
seems
not
such
a
bad
way
to
get
it
known
they
want
something
and
want
it
bad
vida
added
smiling
jean
drew
her
low
chair
almost
in
front
of
the
lady
who
had
so
wounded
her
sensibilities
a
little
while
before
with
that
charge
of
tunbridge
says
before
that
horrid
scene
everything
was
favourable
at
last
the
girl
hazarded
said
freddy
never
had
so
many
friends
in
the
house
before
friends
echoed
the
other
woman
with
a
faint
smile
do
you
say
it
like
that
i
was
thinking
of
a
funny
story
he
it
was
funny
a
liberal
whip
told
me
the
other
day
a
radical
member
went
out
of
the
house
after
his
speech
in
favour
of
the
women
bill
and
as
he
came
back
half
an
hour
later
he
heard
some
members
talking
in
the
lobby
about
the
astonishing
number
who
were
going
to
vote
for
the
measure
and
the
friend
of
woman
dropped
his
jaw
and
clutched
the
man
next
him
my
god
he
said
you
do
mean
they
going
to
it
to
them
here
is
ronald
freddy
tact
brought
her
smiling
to
her
feet
as
the
figure
of
her
appeared
in
the
doorway
but
she
turned
her
back
on
him
and
affected
absorption
in
the
tableau
presented
by
jean
leaning
forward
elbow
on
knee
chin
in
hand
gazing
steadily
in
vida
levering
face
do
want
to
interrupt
you
two
said
the
hostess
i
think
you
must
look
at
the
pictures
yes
i
brought
them
specially
lord
borrodaile
deflected
his
course
in
order
to
take
up
from
the
table
two
squares
of
cardboard
tied
face
to
face
with
tape
the
man
freddy
contemplated
him
with
smiling
affectation
of
scorn
mean
the
new
photographs
of
the
children
he
thinking
of
some
reproductions
herbert
tunbridge
got
while
he
was
abroad
pictures
of
things
somebody
unearthed
in
sicily
or
cyprus
my
dear
he
turned
his
back
on
the
fond
mother
and
jean
who
was
already
with
appreciation
at
the
first
of
a
pile
of
little
saras
and
cecils
when
he
came
back
to
his
corner
of
the
sofa
he
made
no
motion
to
undo
his
packet
but
then
he
said
as
he
often
did
on
sitting
down
beside
vida
levering
as
though
they
had
been
interrupted
on
the
verge
of
coming
to
an
agreement
about
something
she
with
an
instinct
of
returning
the
ball
usually
tossed
at
him
some
scrap
of
news
or
a
jest
or
some
small
social
judgment
this
time
when
he
uttered
his
then
with
that
anticipatory
air
she
answered
instantly
something
rather
odd
has
been
happening
i
been
seeing
beyond
my
usual
range
he
smiled
at
her
with
a
mixture
of
patronage
and
affection
did
you
find
there
was
something
new
under
the
sun
after
all
perhaps
not
so
new
though
it
seemed
new
to
me
but
something
differently
looked
at
why
do
we
pretend
that
all
conversion
is
to
some
religious
dogma
why
not
to
a
view
of
life
my
soul
i
begin
to
feel
nervous
you
remember
once
telling
me
that
i
had
a
thing
that
was
rare
in
my
sex
a
sense
of
humour
remember
often
thinking
it
he
said
handsomely
was
the
first
time
i
heard
that
and
it
was
one
of
the
compliments
i
liked
best
all
do
it
means
we
have
a
sense
of
proportion
the
mental
suppleness
that
is
capable
of
the
ironic
view
an
eye
that
can
look
right
as
well
as
left
she
nodded
you
wrote
to
me
once
my
dear
ironist
i
yes
i
felt
rather
superior
i
conscious
now
that
it
been
a
piece
of
hidden
intellectual
pride
with
me
that
i
could
smile
at
most
things
do
you
mean
to
forswear
pride
for
you
ca
live
without
smiling
seen
something
that
i
do
feel
i
want
to
smile
at
and
yet
to
you
it
the
most
ludicrous
spectacle
in
london
is
all
very
mysterious
he
turned
his
long
whimsical
face
on
one
side
as
he
settled
himself
more
comfortably
against
the
cushion
heard
why
i
was
late
she
said
took
the
liberty
of
doubting
the
reason
you
gave
must
it
was
even
my
first
offence
must
find
time
hang
very
heavy
on
your
hands
the
contrary
i
never
known
the
time
to
go
so
fast
oh
heaps
of
people
would
do
what
i
have
if
they
only
knew
how
queer
and
interesting
it
is
and
how
already
the
outer
aspect
of
the
thing
is
changing
at
the
first
meetings
very
few
women
of
any
class
now
there
are
dozens
scores
soon
there
be
hundreds
there
were
three
thousand
people
in
the
park
this
afternoon
so
a
policeman
told
me
but
hardly
any
of
the
class
that
what
dick
farnborough
calls
runs
england
suppose
not
do
even
know
yet
you
have
to
deal
with
all
that
passionate
feeling
all
that
fixed
determination
to
bring
about
a
vast
change
a
change
so
great
it
would
knock
civilized
society
into
a
cocked
hat
wonder
wonder
if
you
ought
to
be
reassured
by
the
bigness
of
the
thing
it
is
only
these
women
in
hyde
park
they
have
a
feministe
movement
in
france
they
say
there
a
frauenbewegung
in
germany
from
finland
to
italy
yes
strikes
and
uprisings
it
an
uneasy
age
in
india
wanting
a
greater
share
in
the
government
as
the
persians
he
smiled
clamouring
for
a
representative
chamber
it
a
sort
of
epidemic
egyptians
too
restless
under
benefits
and
now
everywhere
as
if
by
some
great
concerted
movement
the
women
yes
there
plenty
of
regrettable
restlessness
up
and
down
the
world
a
sort
of
wave
of
revolt
against
the
constituted
authorities
if
it
goes
too
far
nothing
for
us
but
a
military
despotism
she
shook
her
head
with
a
look
of
such
serene
conviction
that
he
persisted
be
sorry
if
we
came
to
it
but
if
this
spirit
grows
this
rebellion
against
all
forms
of
control
no
against
other
people
control
suppose
it
ends
in
people
learning
the
last
thing
the
masses
can
do
there
are
few
even
of
the
who
have
ever
done
it
and
they
belong
to
the
moral
aristocracy
the
smallest
and
most
rigid
in
the
world
this
thing
that
you
just
opening
your
eyes
to
is
the
rage
against
restraint
that
goes
with
decadence
but
the
phlegmatic
englishman
wo
lead
in
that
dÃ©gringolade
mean
we
wo
be
among
the
first
of
the
great
nations
to
give
women
the
suffrage
the
slow
and
the
smile
airily
relegated
the
woman
movement
to
the
limbo
of
the
infinitely
distant
because
the
men
wo
have
it
and
for
the
second
time
she
said
wonder
for
myself
i
rather
think
the
women
are
going
to
win
in
my
time
not
even
in
yours
the
men
will
never
let
it
come
to
the
point
interesting
to
hear
you
say
that
you
justify
the
militant
women
you
know
is
perhaps
to
hit
the
bull
eye
he
said
a
little
grimly
then
dropping
his
unaccustomed
air
of
chill
disapproval
he
appealed
to
his
friend
better
taste
a
confession
of
sheer
physical
loathing
crept
into
his
face
as
he
let
fall
two
or
three
little
sentences
about
these
women
offence
against
public
decorum
it
is
as
hideous
as
war
he
wound
up
dismissing
it
it
war
her
phrase
drew
the
cloud
of
menace
down
again
it
closed
about
them
it
seemed
to
trouble
her
that
he
would
not
meet
her
gaze
think
she
prayed
and
stumbling
against
the
new
hardness
in
his
face
broke
off
withdrew
her
eyes
and
changed
the
form
of
what
she
had
meant
to
say
think
i
like
good
manners
too
but
i
see
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
put
them
first
what
if
we
have
to
earn
the
right
to
be
gentle
and
gracious
without
shame
seriously
defend
these
people
not
sure
they
have
taken
the
only
way
she
looked
at
her
friend
with
a
fresh
appeal
in
her
eyes
but
his
were
wearing
their
new
cold
look
she
seemed
to
nerve
herself
to
meet
some
numbing
danger
of
cowardice
old
rule
used
to
be
patience
with
no
matter
what
wrong
the
new
feeling
is
shame
on
any
one
who
weakly
suffers
wrong
is
it
too
cheap
an
idea
of
morals
that
women
should
take
credit
for
the
enduring
that
keeps
the
wrong
alive
you
wo
say
women
have
no
stake
in
morals
have
we
any
right
to
let
the
world
go
wrong
while
we
get
compliments
for
our
forbearance
and
for
pretty
manners
began
said
borrodaile
explaining
other
women
notions
you
have
ended
by
seeming
to
adopt
them
as
your
own
but
you
are
a
person
of
some
intelligence
you
will
open
your
eyes
before
you
go
too
far
you
belong
to
the
people
who
are
responsible
for
handing
on
the
treasure
as
we
agreed
there
never
was
a
time
when
it
was
attacked
from
so
many
sides
ca
you
see
what
at
stake
see
that
many
of
the
pleasantest
things
may
be
in
eclipse
for
a
time
dear
they
would
die
off
the
face
of
the
earth
they
are
too
necessary
you
and
me
not
to
the
brawlers
in
hyde
park
the
life
of
civilized
beings
is
a
very
complex
thing
it
is
filled
by
good
intentions
nor
even
by
the
cardinal
virtues
the
function
of
the
older
societies
is
to
hand
on
the
best
things
the
world
has
won
so
that
those
who
come
after
instead
of
having
to
go
back
to
barbarism
may
start
from
where
the
best
of
their
day
left
off
we
do
for
manners
and
the
arts
in
general
what
the
moors
did
for
learning
when
the
wild
hordes
came
down
there
were
capital
chaps
among
the
barbarians
he
smiled
have
a
doubt
but
it
was
the
men
who
held
fast
to
civilization
clue
they
were
the
people
who
mattered
matter
we
hold
the
clue
he
was
recovering
his
spirits
friends
want
to
open
the
gates
still
wider
to
the
huns
you
want
even
the
moors
overwhelmed
women
are
as
jealous
to
guard
the
old
gains
as
the
men
are
wait
she
leaned
forward
begin
to
see
they
are
more
keen
about
it
than
the
mass
of
men
the
women
they
are
civilization
only
ally
against
your
brother
the
goth
he
laughed
you
are
as
absurd
as
that
my
dear
i
do
mind
no
not
a
little
bit
and
i
really
believe
i
too
fond
of
you
to
quarrel
on
any
ground
do
care
enough
about
anything
to
quarrel
about
it
she
said
smiling
too
it
just
as
well
she
rose
and
began
to
draw
on
her
glove
as
well
that
each
of
us
should
know
where
to
find
the
other
so
tell
me
what
if
it
should
be
a
question
of
going
forward
in
the
suffrage
direction
or
going
back
mean
on
from
latchkeys
and
university
degrees
to
parliament
or
back
back
he
said
hastily
yes
back
to
the
harem
when
the
words
were
out
lord
borrodaile
had
laughed
a
little
uneasily
like
one
who
has
surprised
even
himself
by
some
avowal
here
he
put
out
a
hand
not
going
to
let
you
go
for
a
minute
or
two
i
brought
something
to
show
you
this
foolish
discussion
put
it
out
of
my
head
but
the
revealing
word
he
had
flung
out
it
seemed
to
have
struck
wide
some
window
that
had
been
shuttered
close
before
the
woman
stood
there
in
the
glare
she
did
not
refuse
to
be
drawn
back
to
her
place
on
the
sofa
but
she
looked
round
first
to
see
if
the
others
had
heard
and
how
they
took
it
a
glimpse
of
freddy
gown
showed
her
out
of
earshot
on
the
balcony
got
something
here
really
rather
wonderful
lord
borrodaile
went
on
with
that
infrequent
kindling
of
enthusiasm
he
had
taken
one
of
the
unmounted
photographs
from
between
its
two
bits
of
cardboard
and
was
holding
it
up
before
his
eyeglass
he
an
extraordinary
beggar
which
remark
in
the
ears
of
those
who
knew
his
lordship
advertized
his
admiration
of
either
some
man
of
genius
or
of
sorts
before
he
shared
the
picture
with
his
companion
he
told
her
of
what
was
not
then
so
widely
known
details
of
that
most
thrilling
moment
perhaps
in
all
the
romance
of
archÃ¦ology
where
the
excavators
of
knossos
came
upon
the
first
authentic
picture
of
a
man
belonging
to
that
mysterious
and
forgotten
race
that
had
raised
up
a
civilization
in
some
things
rivalling
the
greek
a
race
that
had
watched
minoan
power
wane
and
die
and
all
but
the
dimmest
legend
of
it
vanish
before
the
builders
of
argos
and
mycenÃ¦
began
laying
their
foundation
stones
borrodaile
with
an
accent
that
for
him
was
almost
emotion
emphasized
the
strangeness
to
the
scholar
of
having
to
abandon
the
old
idea
of
the
greek
being
the
sole
flower
of
mediterranean
civilization
for
here
was
this
wonderful
island
folk
a
people
standing
between
and
bridging
east
and
west
these
cretan
men
and
women
who
though
they
show
us
their
faces
their
delicate
art
and
their
stupendous
palaces
have
held
no
parley
with
the
sons
of
men
some
say
for
three
and
thirty
centuries
wait
they
tell
us
tales
before
those
fellows
have
done
i
would
mind
hearing
what
this
beggar
has
to
say
for
himself
at
last
he
shared
the
picture
they
agreed
that
he
was
a
beggar
to
be
reckoned
with
this
proud
athlete
coming
back
to
the
world
of
men
after
his
long
sleep
not
blinded
by
the
new
day
not
primitive
apologetic
but
meeting
us
with
a
high
imperial
mien
daring
and
beautiful
do
you
suppose
he
is
carrying
in
that
vase
vida
asked
is
that
some
trophy
no
it
the
long
drinking
cup
to
the
expert
eye
that
is
added
evidence
of
his
high
degree
of
civilization
but
you
know
a
man
like
that
walking
the
earth
so
long
before
the
greeks
and
here
this
courtly
train
looking
on
at
the
games
what
do
you
say
to
the
women
they
had
got
as
far
as
flouncing
their
gowns
and
puffing
their
sleeves
their
hair
me
they
must
have
had
a
raoul
to
ondulÃ©
and
dress
it
was
there
ever
anything
so
modern
dug
out
of
the
earth
before
nothing
like
it
he
said
holding
the
pictures
up
again
between
the
glass
and
his
kindling
eye
sont
vraiment
des
parisiennes
over
his
shoulder
the
modern
woman
looked
long
at
that
strange
company
is
nothing
less
than
uncanny
she
said
at
last
makes
one
vaguely
wretched
does
realize
that
so
long
ago
the
world
had
got
so
far
why
people
like
these
go
further
still
why
did
their
sons
hold
fast
what
so
great
a
race
had
won
things
go
in
cycles
that
a
phrase
the
woman
mused
cover
our
ignorance
of
how
things
go
and
why
why
should
we
be
so
content
to
go
the
old
way
to
destruction
if
i
were
the
english
of
this
splendid
specimen
of
a
cretan
i
would
at
least
find
a
new
way
to
perdition
we
shall
they
sat
trying
from
the
accounts
of
lord
borrodaile
archÃ¦ological
friends
to
reconstruct
something
of
that
vanished
world
it
was
a
game
they
had
played
at
before
with
etruscan
vases
and
ivories
from
ephesus
the
man
bringing
to
it
his
learning
and
his
wit
the
woman
her
supple
imagination
and
a
passion
of
interest
in
the
great
romance
of
the
pilgrimage
of
man
but
she
bore
a
less
part
all
came
to
an
end
she
repeated
so
shall
we
we
will
leave
your
like
behind
to
hold
fast
to
the
clue
as
you
said
a
little
while
ago
the
turn
of
the
wheel
carries
the
english
down
then
somewhere
else
on
our
uneasy
earth
men
will
begin
again
the
fruitless
round
but
it
horrible
the
waste
of
effort
in
the
world
it
worse
than
horrible
it
insane
she
looked
up
suddenly
into
his
face
are
wise
tell
me
what
you
think
the
story
of
the
world
means
with
its
successive
clutches
at
civilization
all
those
histories
of
slow
and
painful
building
by
ganges
and
by
nile
and
in
the
isles
of
greece
a
part
of
the
universal
rhythm
that
all
things
move
to
way
he
answered
was
it
because
of
some
offence
against
one
of
her
high
laws
that
she
wiped
the
old
experiments
out
what
if
the
meaning
of
history
is
that
an
empire
maintained
by
brute
force
shall
perish
by
brute
force
he
fixed
her
with
those
eyes
of
his
see
where
you
are
going
ca
either
of
you
go
anywhere
said
freddy
appearing
through
the
balcony
window
you
seen
the
children
pictures
vida
eye
had
once
more
fallen
on
the
reproduction
of
one
of
the
cretan
frescoes
with
a
sudden
intensification
of
interest
is
it
borrodaile
asked
looking
over
her
shoulder
she
offered
the
man
the
outermost
fringe
of
her
thought
lady
whyteleafe
she
said
be
satisfied
with
the
attention
they
paid
to
their
hair
you
two
freddy
was
at
last
impatient
got
the
beautiful
pictures
showing
them
to
geoffrey
let
us
all
go
down
to
help
him
to
decide
which
is
the
best
stonor
you
know
him
of
course
but
nobody
knows
the
very
nicest
side
of
geoffrey
do
they
she
appealed
to
borrodaile
who
has
seen
him
with
children
never
saw
him
with
children
said
vida
buttoning
the
last
button
of
her
glove
come
down
and
watch
him
with
sara
and
cecil
they
perfectly
adore
him
it
too
late
but
the
fond
mother
drew
her
friend
to
the
window
can
see
them
from
here
vida
was
not
so
hurried
apparently
but
what
she
could
stand
there
taking
in
the
picture
of
sara
and
cecil
climbing
about
their
big
kind
cousin
with
jean
and
freddy
looking
on
their
mother
waved
a
handkerchief
another
friend
chil
they
too
absorbed
to
notice
she
said
apologetically
turning
to
find
vida
had
left
the
window
and
was
saying
to
borrodaile
yes
he
agreed
wo
care
about
anybody
else
while
geoffrey
is
there
lord
borrodaile
stooped
and
picked
up
a
piece
of
folded
paper
off
the
sofa
i
drop
that
he
opened
it
he
read
the
two
words
out
in
an
accent
that
seemed
to
brand
them
with
foolishness
even
with
vulgarity
decidedly
i
did
not
drop
it
he
was
conveying
the
sheet
to
the
wastepaper
basket
as
one
who
piously
removes
some
unsavoury
litter
out
of
the
way
of
those
who
walk
delicately
miss
levering
arrested
him
with
outstretched
hand
you
want
it
his
look
adjured
her
to
say
i
want
it
for
he
persisted
want
it
for
an
address
there
is
on
it
chapter
xi
it
was
friday
and
was
setting
out
to
alleviate
the
lot
of
the
poor
in
whitechapel
if
it
were
not
friday
vida
said
slyly
as
her
sister
was
preparing
to
leave
the
house
invent
some
errand
to
take
you
out
of
the
contaminated
air
of
queen
anne
gate
this
afternoon
as
i
told
you
said
the
other
woman
nervously
ask
that
person
here
on
your
own
responsibility
vida
smiled
obliged
to
ask
people
here
if
i
want
to
see
them
quietly
you
make
such
a
fuss
when
i
suggest
having
a
house
of
my
own
ignored
the
alternative
see
you
only
making
trouble
for
yourself
you
have
to
pay
handsomely
for
your
curiosity
i
been
rather
economical
of
late
maybe
i
be
able
to
pay
imagine
you
be
able
to
settle
an
account
of
that
kind
with
a
single
cheque
give
people
like
that
an
inch
and
they
expect
a
weekly
ell
you
afraid
she
abstract
the
spoons
not
only
afraid
i
she
wo
be
satisfied
with
one
contribution
or
one
visit
she
regard
it
as
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
getting
her
nose
into
a
house
of
this
kind
irresistibly
the
words
conjured
up
a
vision
of
some
female
marauder
insinuating
the
tip
of
a
very
pointed
nose
between
the
great
front
door
and
the
lintel
only
hope

elder
woman

wherewith

range
in
the

old
way
little
doris

understood
to
have
joined
his
brother
coaching
party
the
time

been
discreetly
chosen

coast

indubitably
clear
but
would
it
remain
so
to
insure
that
it
should

a
private

the
butler

a
stranger
some
one
who

window
if

the
person

bell
you

if
the
bell
has
rung
just
as
this
person
comes
it
will
be
the
one
i
expecting
miss
with
a
splendid
impassivity
in
the
face
of
precautions
so
unprecedented
the
servant
withdrew
vida
smiled
to
herself
as
she
leaned
back
among
the
cushions
of
her
capacious
sofa
cutting
the
pages
of
a
book
a
pleasant
place
this
room
of
hers
wide
and
cool
where
the
creamy
background
of
wall
and
was
with
roses
the
open
windows
looked
out
upon
one
of
those
glimpses
of
greenery
made
vivid
to
the
london
eye
not
alone
by
gratitude
but
by
contrast
of
the
leafage
against
the
ebonized
bark
of
bole
and
twig
the
summer
wind
was
making
great
gentle
fans
of
the
plane
branches
it
was
swaying
the
curtains
that
hung
down
in
long
straight
folds
from
the
high
cornices
no
other
sound
in
the
room
but
the
hard
grate
of
the
ivory
sawing
its
way
through
a
book
whose
outside
alone
a
pimpled
cloth
proclaimed
it
utilitarian
among
the
italian
volumes
the
poets
and
those
wearing
linen
or
morocco
to
suit
a
special
taste
above
all
among
that
greater
company
impudently
french
that
stood
close
ranked
on
shelves
or
lay
about
on
tables
the
brown
book
on
its
dusty
modern
theme
wore
the
air
of
a
yeoman
sitting
amongst
broadcloth
and
silk
the
reader
glanced
from
time
to
time
at
the
clock
when
the
small
glittering
hand
on
the
porcelain
face
pointed
to
twenty
minutes
past
five
the
lady
took
her
book
and
her
into
a
front
room
on
the
floor
below
she
sat
down
behind
the
lowered
persienne
and
every
now
and
then
lifted
her
eyes
from
the
page
and
peered
out
between
the
tiny
slits
as
the
time
went
on
she
looked
out
oftener
more
than
once
she
half
rose
and
seemed
about
to
abandon
all
hope
of
the
mysterious
visitor
when
a
hansom
dashed
up
to
the
door
one
swift
glance
go
in
cabs
and
miss
levering
ran
to
the
bell
a
few
moments
after
she
was
again
established
in
her
sofa
corner
and
the
door
of
her
opened
lady
miss
into
the
wide
harmonious
space
was
ushered
a
hot
and
woman
in
a
lank
alpaca
gown
and
a
miss
claxton
clothes
like
herself
had
borne
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
day
she
frowned
as
she
gave
her
hand
am
late
but
it
was
very
difficult
to
get
away
at
all
miss
levering
pushed
towards
her
one
of
the
welcoming
great
that
stood
holding
out
cool
arms
and
a
lap
of
roses
the
tired
visitor
with
her
dusty
clothes
and
brusque
manner
sat
down
without
relaxing
to
the
luxurious
invitation
her
stiffly
maintained
attitude
and
direct
look
said
as
plain
as
print
now
what
excuse
have
you
to
offer
for
asking
me
to
come
here
it
may
have
been
recollection
of
fear
of
thin
end
of
the
wedge
that
made
miss
levering
smile
as
she
said
i
been
expecting
you
for
the
last
half
hour
but
it
very
good
of
you
to
come
at
all
miss
claxton
looked
as
if
she
quite
agreed
have
some
tea
miss
levering
was
moving
towards
the
bell
i
had
my
tea
the
queer
sound
of
tea
connoting
so
much
else
the
hostess
subsided
on
to
the
sofa
heard
you
speak
the
other
day
as
i
told
you
in
my
note
but
all
the
same
i
came
away
with
several
unanswered
questions
questions
that
i
wanted
to
put
to
you
quietly
as
i
wrote
you
i
am
not
what
would
call
a
convert
i
only
got
as
far
as
the
inquiry
stage
miss
claxton
waited
if
i
take
up
your
time
i
ought
not
to
let
you
be
out
of
pocket
by
it
the
hostess
glanced
towards
the
little
where
on
top
of
a
heap
of
notes
lay
the
blue
oblong
of
a
consider
it
part
of
every
day
business
to
answer
questions
said
miss
claxton
suppose
i
can
make
some
little
contribution
without
without
its
committing
me
to
anything
you
it
would
get
into
the
papers
she
said
a
little
shamefaced
or
anything
like
that
would
get
into
the
papers
unless
you
put
it
in
the
lady
blinked
there
was
a
little
pause
she
was
not
easy
to
talk
to
this
young
woman
nor
was
she
the
ideal
collector
of
contributions
was
a
remarkable
meeting
you
had
in
hyde
park
last
sunday
oh
no
they
all
pretty
much
alike
they
all
end
like
that
yes
people
come
to
scoff
and
by
degrees
we
get
hold
of
them
even
the
hyde
park
loafers
mean
do
they
often
crowd
up
and
try
to
hustle
the
speakers
they
are
usually
quite
handled
them
wonderfully
used
to
dealing
with
crowds
her
look
went
round
the
room
as
if
to
say
this
kind
of
thing
not
used
to
and
i
do
take
to
it
the
crush
at
the
end
said
miss
levering
overheard
a
scrap
of
conversation
between
two
men
they
were
talking
about
you
very
good
for
a
woman
one
said
miss
claxton
smiled
a
scornful
little
smile
the
other
one
said
it
would
have
been
very
good
for
a
man
and
personally
he
said
i
do
know
many
men
who
could
have
kept
that
crowd
in
hand
for
two
hours
that
what
two
men
thought
of
it
she
made
no
answer
does
seem
to
me
possible
that
your
speakers
average
as
good
as
those
i
heard
on
sunday
have
a
good
many
who
speak
well
but
we
look
upon
ernestine
blunt
as
our
genius
she
seems
rather
a
wonderful
little
person
but
i
wrote
to
you
because
partly
because
you
are
older
and
you
gave
me
the
impression
of
being
extremely
blunt
is
too
said
miss
claxton
warily
she
was
looking
into
the
lady
face
frowning
a
little
in
that
way
of
hers
intent
even
somewhat
suspicious
i
dare
say
but
she
such
a
child
sometimes
think
ernestine
blunt
has
the
oldest
head
among
us
said
miss
levering
a
person
is
as
young
as
that
you
do
know
how
much
is
her
own
and
how
much
borrowed
does
need
to
borrow
i
said
to
myself
that
woman
who
makes
other
things
so
clear
she
can
clear
up
one
or
two
things
for
me
i
do
know
more
wary
than
ever
she
suspended
judgment
noticed
none
of
you
paid
any
attention
when
the
crowd
called
out
things
about
miss
claxton
frown
deepened
it
was
plain
she
heard
the
echo
of
that
insistent
query
of
the
crowd
your
miss
she
waited
it
looked
as
though
miss
levering
lacked
courage
to
repeat
it
in
all
its
violent
when
they
called
out
things
about
the
encounters
with
the
police
it
those
stories
as
i
suppose
you
know
that
have
set
so
many
against
the
movement
no
word
out
of
miss
claxton
she
sat
there
not
leaning
back
nor
any
longer
stiffly
upright
but
hunched
together
like
a
creature
ready
to
spring
believed
those
stories
too
but
when
i
had
watched
you
and
listened
to
you
on
sunday
miss
levering
hastened
to
add
a
little
shamefaced
at
the
necessity
said
to
myself
not
suddenly
she
stopped
and
smiled
with
disarming
frankness
did
say
that
woman
too
or
too
amiable
i
said
she
too
intelligent
that
woman
never
spat
at
a
policeman
no
she
said
grimly
nor
bit
nor
scratched
nor
any
of
those
things
and
since
the
papers
have
lied
about
that
i
said
to
myself
i
go
to
headquarters
for
information
papers
do
you
read
practically
all
this
house
is
like
a
club
for
papers
and
magazines
my
has
everything
i
never
saw
the
is
the
organ
of
our
party
i
afraid
i
never
heard
of
any
of
them
miss
claxton
smiled
take
them
in
myself
in
future
said
the
lady
on
the
sofa
it
reading
those
papers
that
set
you
to
thinking
papers
oh
no
it
was
she
hesitated
and
puckered
up
her
brows
again
as
she
stared
round
the
room
go
on
that
one
of
the
things
i
wanted
to
know
if
you
mind
how
you
came
to
be
identified
with
the
movement
a
little
wearily
without
the
smallest
spark
of
enthusiasm
at
the
prospect
of
imparting
her
biography
miss
claxton
told
slowly
even
dully
and
wholly
without
passion
the
story
of
a
hard
life
met
from
even
the
tender
childhood
days
one
of
those
recitals
that
change
the
relation
between
the
one
who
tells
and
the
one
who
listens
makes
the
last
a
sharer
in
the
life
to
the
extent
that
the
two
can
never
be
strangers
any
more
though
they
may
not
meet
nor
write
nor
have
any
tangible
communication
there
is
understanding
between
them
at
the
close
miss
levering
stood
up
and
gave
the
other
her
hand
neither
said
anything
they
looked
at
each
other
after
the
lady
had
resumed
her
seat
miss
claxton
as
under
some
compulsion
born
of
the
other
act
of
sympathy
went
on
is
a
newspaper
lie
as
you
have
needed
to
be
told
about
the
spitting
and
scratching
and
biting
but
the
day
i
was
arrested
the
day
of
the
deputation
to
effingham
i
saw
a
policeman
knocking
some
of
our
poorer
women
about
very
roughly
it
had
its
significance
the
tone
in
which
she
said
poorer
women
called
out
that
he
was
not
to
do
that
again
he
had
one
of
our
women
like
this
and
he
was
banging
her
against
the
railings
i
called
out
if
he
did
stop
i
would
make
him
he
kept
on
a
cold
glitter
came
into
the
eyes
i
struck
him
i
struck
the
coward
in
the
face
the
air
of
the
mild
luxurious
room
grew
hot
and
quivered
the
lady
on
the
sofa
lowered
her
eyes
must
be
taught
the
other
said
sternly
police
must
be
taught
they
are
not
to
treat
our
women
like
that
on
the
whole
the
police
behave
well
but
their
power
is
immense
and
almost
entirely
unchecked
it
a
marvel
they
are
as
decent
as
they
are
how
should
be
expected
to
know
how
to
treat
women
what
example
do
they
have
do
they
hear
constantly
in
the
courts
how
little
it
costs
a
man
to
be
convicted
of
beating
his
own
wife
she
fired
the
questions
at
the
innocent
person
on
the
sofa
as
if
she
held
her
directly
responsible
for
the
need
to
ask
them
is
far
more
dangerous
yes
even
if
a
man
starving
that
because
bread
is
often
dear
and
women
are
always
cheap
she
waited
a
moment
waited
for
the
other
to
contradict
or
at
least
resent
the
dictum
the
motionless
figure
among
the
sofa
cushions
whose
very
look
and
air
seemed
to
proclaim
of
us
are
expensive
enough
hardly
opened
her
lips
to
say
as
if
to
herself
women
are
cheap
perhaps
miss
claxton
thought
the
agreement
lacked
conviction
for
she
went
on
with
a
harsh
hostility
that
seemed
almost
personal
rather
any
day
be
handled
by
the
police
than
by
the
stewards
of
political
meetings
partly
the
words
even
more
the
look
in
the
darkening
face
made
miss
levering
say
brings
me
to
something
else
i
wanted
to
be
enlightened
about
one
reason
i
wrote
to
ask
for
a
little
talk
with
specially
was
because
i
could
imagine
your
doing
anything
so
futile
as
to
pit
your
physical
strength
considerable
as
it
may
be
but
to
pit
your
muscle
against
men
is
merely
absurd
and
i
when
i
saw
how
intelligent
you
were
i
saw
that
you
know
all
that
quite
as
well
as
i
why
then
carry
a
whip
the
lowered
eyelids
of
the
face
opposite
quivered
faintly
could
think
it
would
save
you
from
arrest
not
from
arrest
the
woman
mouth
hardened
know
miss
levering
bridged
the
embarrassment
of
the
pause
know
there
must
be
some
rational
explanation
but
if
there
were
it
was
not
forthcoming
you
see
your
most
indefensible
and
even
action
gave
the
cue
for
my
greatest
interest
said
vida
with
a
mixture
of
anxiety
and
bluntness
just
the
woman
you
were
to
do
so
brainless
a
thing
what
was
behind
that
was
what
i
kept
asking
myself
is
only
treatment
one
or
two
of
us
have
met
she
pulled
out
the
words
slowly
sometimes
worse
they
both
waited
in
a
curious
chill
embarrassment
the
police
but
the
stewards
at
political
meetings
and
the
men
who
volunteer
to
keep
the
women
in
order
they
she
raised
her
fierce
eyes
and
the
colour
rose
in
her
cheeks
they
turning
us
out
they
punish
us
in
ways
the
public
do
know
she
saw
the
shrinking
wonder
in
the
woman
opposite
and
she
did
not
spare
her
punish
us
by
underhand
maltreatment
of
the
kind
most
intolerable
to
a
decent
woman
no
no
the
other
face
was
a
flame
to
match
she
flung
it
out
like
a
poisoned
arrow
they
said
vida
in
a
whisper
know
we
dare
not
complain
not
a
duller
red
overspread
the
face
as
the
woman
muttered
no
woman
wants
to
talk
about
it
and
if
we
did
they
only
say
see
you
killing
chivalry
she
laughed
it
was
not
good
to
hear
a
laugh
like
that
the
figure
on
the
sofa
winced
assure
you
people
do
know
said
vida
known
well
enough
to
those
who
had
to
suffer
it
and
it
known
to
the
brutes
of
men
who
but
you
realize
miss
levering
jumped
to
her
feet
must
admit
that
the
great
mass
of
men
would
be
indignant
if
they
knew
think
so
the
question
was
insulting
in
its
air
of
forbearance
with
a
view
of
life
so
i
it
i
should
be
sorry
for
my
own
powers
of
judgment
if
i
believed
the
majority
of
men
were
like
the
worst
specimens
like
those
you
well
we
do
dwell
on
that
side
it
enough
to
remember
that
women
without
our
incentive
have
to
bear
worse
it
part
of
a
whole
system
shall
never
believe
that
exclaimed
vida
thinking
what
was
meant
was
an
organized
conspiracy
against
the
suffragettes
it
all
part
of
the
system
we
are
in
the
world
to
overturn
why
should
we
suppose
we
gain
anything
by
complaining
do
hundreds
thousands
of
meek
creatures
who
have
never
defied
anybody
do
they
have
to
bear
worse
ignominies
every
man
knows
that
true
who
troubles
himself
what
is
the
use
we
say
of
crying
about
individual
pains
and
penalties
no
the
thing
is
to
work
day
and
night
to
root
out
the
system
that
makes
such
things
possible
still
do
understand
why
you
thought
it
would
be
a
protection
to
carry
man
fear
of
ridicule
will
restrain
him
when
nothing
else
will
if
one
of
them
is
publicly
whipped
by
a
it
is
likely
to
be
forgotten
even
the
fear
of
it
protects
us
from
some
things
after
an
experience
some
of
the
women
had
the
moment
our
committee
decided
on
another
demonstration
little
mary
went
out
without
consulting
anybody
and
bought
me
the
whip
if
you
will
go
she
said
you
go
unarmed
if
we
have
that
sort
of
cur
to
deal
with
the
only
thing
is
to
carry
a
miss
claxton
clenched
her
hands
in
their
grey
cotton
gloves
there
was
silence
in
the
room
for
several
seconds
we
do
in
asking
questions
publicly
it
only
what
men
do
constantly
the
greatest
statesman
in
the
land
stops
to
answer
a
man
even
if
he
a
fool
naturally
or
half
drunk
they
treat
those
interrupters
with
respect
they
answer
their
questions
civilly
they
are
men
they
have
votes
but
women
where
the
chucker
out
you
never
afraid
that
all
you
going
through
may
be
in
vain
we
are
quite
certain
to
succeed
we
have
found
the
right
way
at
last
mean
what
are
called
your
tactics
mean
the
spirit
of
the
women
i
mean
not
to
mind
the
price
when
you
got
people
to
feel
like
that
success
is
sure
it
comes
very
hard
on
those
few
who
pay
with
the
person
as
the
french
say
pay
with
prison
and
with
is
the
worst
a
kind
of
shyness
came
over
the
woman
on
the
sofa
she
dropped
her
eyes
from
the
other
face
course
the
went
on
more
women
did
a
little
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
few
to
do
so
much
suppose
you
are
in
need
of
funds
to
carry
on
the
propaganda
is
what
is
most
needed
one
of
our
workers
a
little
mill
girl
came
up
from
the
country
with
only
two
pounds
in
her
pocket
to
rouse
london
and
she
did
it
her
comrade
exulted
there
a
class
we
do
reach
if
only
she
hesitated
and
glanced
reflectively
at
the
woman
before
her
miss
levering
eye
flew
to
the
only
we
could
get
women
of
influence
to
understand
what
at
stake
said
miss
claxton
a
little
wistfully
do
some
a
few
as
much
as
can
be
expected
do
you
say
that
the
women
i
do
say
all
she
spoke
as
one
exercising
an
extreme
moderation
many
of
them
are
such
sexless
creatures
miss
levering
opened
wide
eyes
a
glint
of
something
like
amazed
laughter
crossed
her
face
as
she
repeated
are
sexless
you
think
find
them
so
said
the
other
firmly
miss
levering
smiled
outright
what
they
say
of
you
it
nonsense
like
the
rest
of
what
they
say
the
accusation
of
sexlessness
brought
against
the
curled
darlings
of
society
by
these
sisters
of
theirs
was
not
the
least
ironic
thing
in
the
situation
do
you
call
them
we
see
they
have
no
if
they
had
they
could
do
the
things
they
do
sort
of
things
i
ca
go
into
that
she
stood
up
and
tugged
at
her
wrinkled
cotton
gloves
it
easy
for
us
to
see
they
sexless
she
seemed
to
resent
the
unbelief
in
the
opposite
face
caterham
sent
for
me
the
other
day
you
may
have
heard
of
lady
caterham
miss
levering
suppressed
the
fact
of
how
much
by
a
yes
she
sent
for
me
to
oh
i
suppose
she
was
curious
me
said
the
other
smiling
a
very
great
person
in
her
county
and
she
she
sympathized
with
the
movement
only
she
did
approve
of
our
tactics
she
said
we
are
pretty
well
used
by
now
to
people
who
do
approve
of
our
tactics
so
i
just
sat
and
waited
for
the
it
was
obvious
that
the
lady
without
influence
in
her
county
winced
at
that
almost
as
though
she
felt
the
whip
on
her
own
shoulders
she
was
indeed
a
this
woman
do
go
about
talking
of
why
i
carry
a
whip
i
talking
about
it
she
flung
the
words
out
resentfully
i
been
sent
to
try
to
get
that
woman
to
help
and
so
i
explained
i
told
her
when
she
asked
why
it
seemed
necessary
again
the
face
flushed
told
her
more
than
i
told
you
and
will
you
believe
it
she
never
turned
a
hair
just
sat
there
with
a
look
of
cool
curiosity
on
her
face
oh
they
have
no
those
women
caterham
probably
did
understand
she
asked
questions
no
it
just
did
matter
much
to
her
that
a
woman
should
suffer
that
sort
of
thing
she
did
feel
the
indignity
of
it
perhaps
if
it
had
come
to
her
would
have
suffered
said
the
critic
with
a
grim
contempt
may
be
another
explanation
said
miss
levering
a
little
curtly
but
wisely
she
forbore
to
present
it
if
the
rough
and
ready
reformer
had
chilled
her
new
sympathizer
by
this
bitterness
against
parasite
class
she
wiped
out
the
memory
of
it
by
the
enthusiasm
with
which
she
spoke
of
those
other
women
her
women
are
wonderful
she
lifted
her
tired
head
knew
never
had
a
chance
to
show
what
they
were
but
there
are
some
things
no
i
did
think
women
had
it
in
them
she
had
got
up
and
was
standing
now
by
the
door
her
limp
gown
clinging
round
her
her
tam
on
one
side
but
in
the
confident
look
with
which
she
spoke
of
women
the
brow
had
cleared
you
saw
that
it
was
beautiful
miss
levering
stood
at
the
door
with
an
anxious
eye
on
the
stair
as
if
fearful
of
the
of
or
direr
catastrophe
old
discovering
the
damning
fact
of
this
outlaw
presence
under
his
roof
yet
even
so
torn
thus
between
dread
and
desire
to
pluck
out
the
heart
of
the
new
mystery
militant
woman
miss
levering
did
not
speed
the
parting
guest
as
though
recognizing
fully
now
that
the
prophesied
use
was
not
going
to
be
made
of
the
end
of
the
wedge
she
detained
her
with
wonder
when
i
shall
see
you
again
do
know
said
the
other
absently
is
the
next
meeting
sunday
every
sunday
shall
be
glad
to
hear
you
speak
again
but
you
come
and
see
me
here
ca
i
going
away
to
rest
i
hope
she
laughed
at
an
idea
so
comic
no
i
going
to
work
among
the
women
in
wales
we
have
great
hopes
of
those
women
they
splendid
they
learning
the
secret
of
too
oh
it
good
stuff
to
work
on
the
relief
of
it
after
london
miss
levering
smiled
i
wo
be
seeing
you
very
soon
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
true
what
i
say
of
the
welsh
women
and
yet
we
ought
to
be
ungrateful
to
our
london
women
either
she
seemed
to
have
some
sense
of
injustice
on
her
soul
been
seeing
just
recently
what
they
made
of
too
she
paused
on
the
threshold
and
began
to
tell
in
a
low
voice
of
women
to
the
work
who
had
been
wavering
uncertain
if
they
could
risk
imprisonment
poor
women
with
husbands
and
children
they
heard
it
might
this
battle
we
fighting
they
were
ashamed
not
to
help
us
mean
vida
began
shrinking
said
the
other
fiercely
older
women
saw
they
ought
to
save
the
younger
ones
from
having
to
face
that
sort
of
thing
that
was
how
we
got
some
of
the
wives
and
mothers
she
went
on
with
a
stern
emotion
that
was
oddly
contagious
telling
about
a
certain
scene
at
the
headquarters
of
the
union
against
the
grey
and
squalid
background
of
a
poor
women
movement
stood
out
in
those
next
seconds
a
picture
that
the
true
historian
who
is
to
come
will
not
neglect
a
call
for
recruits
with
this
result
a
huddled
group
all
new
unproved
ignorant
of
the
ignorant
the
two
or
three
leaders
feeling
it
necessary
to
explain
to
the
untried
women
that
if
they
shared
in
the
agitation
they
were
not
only
facing
imprisonment
but
unholy
handling
was
only
fair
to
let
them
know
the
worst
said
the
woman
at
the
door
they
were
allowed
to
join
us
as
the
abrupt
sentences
fell
the
grim
little
scene
was
reconstituted
the
shrinking
of
the
women
who
had
offered
their
services
ignorant
of
this
aspect
of
the
battle
their
horror
and
their
shame
at
the
memory
of
that
hour
the
voice
shook
cried
those
women
she
said
they
came
asked
the
other
trembling
as
though
for
her
too
it
was
vital
that
these
poor
women
should
not
quail
answered
their
leader
a
little
hoarsely
came
chapter
xii
one
of
the
oddest
things
about
these
was
the
simplicity
with
which
they
accepted
aid
the
absence
in
the
responsible
ones
of
conventional
gratitude
this
became
matter
for
both
surprise
and
instruction
to
the
outsider
it
no
doubt
had
the
effect
of
chilling
and
alienating
the
on
the
make
even
to
the
less
ungenerous
not
bargainers
for
approbation
or
for
influence
even
in
their
case
the
suspicion
we
have
been
taught
to
cultivate
for
one
another
makes
the
gift
of
good
faith
so
difficult
that
it
can
be
given
freely
only
to
people
like
these
people
who
plainly
and
daily
suffered
for
their
creed
who
stood
to
lose
all
the
things
most
of
us
strive
for
people
who
valued
neither
comfort
nor
money
nor
the
world
good
word
that
they
took
help
and
even
sacrifice
as
a
matter
of
course
seemed
in
them
mere
modesty
and
sound
good
sense
tantamount
to
saying
am
not
so
silly
or
as
to
suppose
you
do
this
for
you
do
it
of
course
for
the
cause
the
cause
is
yours
is
all
women
you
serve
humanity
who
am
i
that
i
should
thank
you
this
attitude
extended
even
to
acts
that
were
in
truth
prompted
less
by
concern
for
the
larger
issue
than
by
sheer
personal
interest
vida
levering
first
experience
of
this
attitude
came
one
late
afternoon
while
on
her
way
to
leave
cards
on
some
people
in
grosvenor
road
driving
through
pimlico
about
six
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
at
the
sound
of
many
voices
and
beheld
a
mob
of
men
and
boys
in
the
act
of
pursuing
a
little
group
of
women
who
were
fleeing
up
a
side
street
away
from
the
river
the
natural
shrinking
and
disgust
of
sheltered
woman
showed
in
the
face
of
the
occupant
of
the
brougham
as
she
leaned
forward
and
said
to
the
coachman
this
way
do
you
see
there
some
disturbance
turn
back
the
man
obeyed
the
little
crowd
had
halted
it
looked
as
if
the
thief
or
drunken
woman
or
what
not
had
been
surrounded
and
overwhelmed
the
end
of
the
street
abutted
on
pimlico
pier
two
or
three
knots
of
people
were
still
standing
about
talking
and
looking
up
the
street
at
the
little
crowd
of
shouting
gesticulating
rowdies
a
woman
with
a
perambulator
making
up
her
mind
at
just
the
wrong
moment
to
cross
the
road
found
herself
almost
under
the
feet
of
the
horses
the
coachman
pulled
up
sharply
and
before
he
had
driven
on
the
lady
eyes
had
fallen
on
an
inscription
in
white
chalk
on
the
flagstone
for
women
here
at
a
quarter
to
six
the
occupant
of
the
carriage
turned
her
head
sharply
in
the
direction
of
the
and
then
all
i
must
go
up
that
street
drive
fast
till
you
get
near
those
people
quick
miss
yes
make
haste
for
the
crowd
was
moving
on
and
still
no
sign
of
a
policeman
by
the
time
the
brougham
caught
up
with
them
the
little
huddle
of
folk
had
nearly
reached
the
top
of
the
street
in
the
middle
of
the
a
familiar
face
ernestine
blunt
henderson
miss
levering
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
girl
the
young
one
she
being
mobbed
miss
something
must
be
done
hail
a
policeman
miss
you
a
policeman
miss
stop
a
moment
for
even
at
this
slowest
gait
the
brougham
had
passed
the
storm
centre
the
lady
hanging
out
of
the
window
looked
back
and
saw
that
face
very
pink
as
to
cheeks
very
bright
as
to
eyes
was
turned
quite
unruffled
on
the
rabble
you
see
the
meeting
over
she
called
out
boys
go
home
now
and
think
about
what
we
told
you
the
reply
to
that
was
a
laugh
and
a
concerted
that
all
but
carried
the
girl
and
her
companions
off
their
feet
to
petrifaction
the
door
of
the
brougham
was
hastily
opened
and
then
slammed
to
leaving
miss
levering
in
the
road
saying
to
him
over
her
shoulder
just
round
the
corner
unless
i
call
with
which
she
hurried
across
the
street
her
eyes
on
the
little
face
that
in
spite
of
its
fresh
colouring
looked
so
pathetically
tired
making
her
way
round
the
outer
fringe
of
the
crowd
vida
saw
on
the
other
side
near
where
ernestine
and
her
companions
stood
with
their
backs
to
the
wall
an
opening
in
the
dingy
ranks
fleet
of
foot
she
gained
it
thrust
an
arm
between
the
huddled
women
and
taking
the
foolhardy
girl
by
the
sleeve
said
come
with
me
ernestine
raised
her
eyes
fixed
them
for
one
calm
instant
on
vida
levering
face
and
then
turning
round
said
mrs
brown
mind
mrs
brown
whispered
the
strange
lady
drawing
off
as
the
rowdy
young
men
came
surging
round
that
side
there
was
another
rush
and
a
yell
and
vida
fled
when
next
she
turned
to
look
it
was
to
see
two
women
making
a
sudden
dash
for
liberty
they
had
escaped
through
the
rowdy
ranks
and
they
tore
across
the
street
running
for
their
lives
and
calling
for
help
as
they
ran
vida
a
shade
or
two
paler
stood
transfixed
what
was
going
to
happen
but
there
was
the
imperturbable
ernestine
holding
the
forsaken
position
still
the
centre
of
the
pushing
shouting
little
mob
who
had
jeered
frantically
as
the
other
women
fled
it
was
too
much
not
ernestine
isolation
alone
the
something
childish
in
the
brilliant
face
would
have
enlisted
a
less
sympathetic
observer
a
single
moment
wavering
and
the
lady
made
for
the
place
where
the
besiegers
massed
less
thick
she
was
near
enough
now
to
call
out
over
the
rowdies
heads
why
do
you
stay
there
faces
turned
to
look
at
her
while
ernestine
shouted
back
the
cryptic
sentence
was
my
bus
had
danger
robbed
her
of
her
reason
the
boys
were
cheering
now
and
looking
past
miss
levering
she
turned
bewildered
to
see
brown
and
a
sister
reformer
mounting
the
top
of
a
sober
london
road
car
they
had
been
running
for
that
then
and
not
for
life
miss
levering
raised
her
hand
and
her
voice
as
she
looked
back
at
ernestine
got
a
trap
come
ernestine
stepped
out
from
the
vociferating
jostling
crowd
and
followed
the
new
face
as
simply
as
though
she
had
been
waiting
for
just
that
summons
the
awful
moment
was
when
with
a
shout
the
tail
of
rowdies
followed
after
miss
levering
had
not
bargained
for
that
her
agitated
glance
left
the
unsavoury
horde
at
her
heels
and
went
nervously
up
and
down
the
street
it
was
plainly
not
only
nor
even
chiefly
the
hooligans
she
feared
but
the
amazÃ©d
eye
of
some
acquaintance
bad
enough
to
meet
henderson
in
she
said
hastily
to
the
girl
and
then
on
she
called
out
desperately
flying
in
after
ernestine
and
slamming
the
door
she
thrust
her
head
through
the
window
to
add
and
she
sank
back
dreadful
that
was
was
said
the
rescued
one
glancing
out
of
the
carriage
with
an
air
of
suddenly
renewed
interest
the
attack
of
those
hooligans
on
a
handful
of
defenceless
women
they
were
attacking
us
were
they
doing
just
running
after
us
and
screaming
a
little
i
them
pushing
and
jostling
and
it
was
all
quite
mean
you
were
frightened
nothing
to
be
frightened
at
she
was
actually
saying
it
in
a
soothing
sort
of
way
calculated
to
steady
the
nerves
reassuring
the
rescuer
vida
eye
fell
on
the
festoon
of
braid
falling
from
the
dark
cloth
skirt
the
polite
attentions
of
your
friends
seem
to
have
rather
damaged
your
gown
over
a
big
leather
portfolio
that
she
held
clasped
in
her
arms
ernestine
too
looked
down
at
the
torn
frock
foolish
trimming
it
always
getting
stepped
on
miss
levering
search
had
produced
a
pin
i
just
pull
it
off
ernestine
did
so
and
proceeded
to
drop
a
yard
of
it
out
of
the
window
miss
levering
began
to
laugh
way
are
we
going
says
miss
blunt
looking
out
have
to
be
at
battersea
at
were
you
doing
at
pimlico
pier
a
meeting
for
the
government
employees
the
people
who
work
for
the
army
and
navy
clothing
department
and
you
live
at
battersea
but
i
have
a
meeting
there
we
had
a
very
good
one
at
the
docks
too
her
eyes
sparkled
suffrage
meeting
one
of
the
best
we
had
was
that
the
dinner
hour
the
men
stood
with
their
pails
and
ate
while
they
listened
they
were
quite
nice
and
understanding
those
men
day
was
that
morning
the
battersea
meeting
not
for
another
hour
but
i
have
to
be
there
first
to
arrange
do
you
dine
i
get
something
either
before
the
meeting
or
after
whenever
there
time
it
a
pity
not
to
get
your
food
regularly
wo
you
last
longer
if
you
do
i
shall
last
she
sat
contentedly
hugging
her
big
portfolio
the
lady
glanced
at
the
carriage
clock
the
house
where
i
live
dinner
is
a
sort
of
sacred
rite
if
you
are
two
seconds
late
you
are
disgraced
so
i
afraid
i
ca
the
bus
i
was
waiting
for
ernestine
thrust
her
head
out
will
you
she
commanded
the
astonished
henderson
she
nodded
jumped
out
shut
the
door
steadied
her
hat
and
was
gone
it
was
so
an
acquaintance
began
that
was
destined
to
make
a
difference
to
more
than
one
life
those
days
of
the
summer
that
miss
claxton
spent
indoctrinating
the
women
of
wales
and
that
chisholm
utilized
in
scotland
were
dedicated
by
ernestine
and
her
friends
to
stirring
up
london
and
the
various
dim
and
populous
worlds
of
the
suburbs
much
oftener
than
even
knew
her
sister
instead
of
being
in
the
houses
where
she
was
supposed
to
be
and
doing
the
things
she
was
expected
to
be
doing
might
have
been
seen
in
highly
unexpected
haunts
prosecuting
her
acquaintance
with
cockney
crowds
never
learning
ernestine
fearlessness
of
them
and
yet
in
some
way
fascinated
almost
as
much
as
she
was
repelled
at
first
she
would
sit
in
a
hansom
at
safe
distance
from
the
turmoil
that
was
usually
created
by
the
expounders
of
what
to
the
populace
was
a
new
doctrine
invented
by
ernestine
miss
levering
would
lean
over
the
apron
of
the
cab
hearing
only
scraps
till
the
final
all
who
are
in
favour
of
justice
hold
up
their
hands
as
the
crowd
broke
and
dissolved
the
lady
in
the
hansom
would
throw
open
the
doors
and
standing
up
in
front
of
the
dashboard
she
would
hail
and
carry
off
the
while
the
crowd
surged
round
several
times
this
programme
had
been
carried
out
when
one
afternoon
after
seeing
the
girl
and
her
big
leather
portfolio
safe
in
the
cab
and
the
cab
safe
out
of
the
crowd
vida
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
now
tell
me
what
did
you
do
yesterday
meaning
how
in
the
world
did
you
manage
without
me
to
take
care
of
you
we
had
a
meeting
down
at
the
woolwich
arsenal
and
we
distributed
handbills
for
two
hours
and
we
had
a
debate
in
the
evening
at
the
new
reform
club
you
did
hold
a
meeting
here
in
the
afternoon
we
did
i
forgot
that
she
seemed
also
to
have
forgotten
that
her
new
friend
had
been
prevented
from
appearing
to
carry
her
off
miss
levering
smiled
down
at
her
a
funny
little
person
you
are
do
you
know
who
i
am
has
ever
occurred
to
you
to
ask
the
face
turned
to
her
with
a
half
roguish
smile
i
thought
you
looked
all
right
the
person
who
had
the
interview
with
your
friend
miss
claxton
as
no
recollection
showed
in
the
face
queen
anne
gate
she
added
do
think
i
knew
about
that
said
ernestine
absently
then
alert
disdainful
the
member
for
wrotton
saying
yes
we
went
to
see
him
this
morning
that
is
very
exciting
what
was
he
like
a
feeble
sort
of
person
i
thought
laughed
miss
levering
talked
such
nonsense
to
us
about
that
old
plural
voting
bill
his
idea
seemed
to
be
to
get
us
to
promise
to
behave
nicely
while
the
overworked
house
of
commons
considered
the
iniquity
of
some
men
having
more
than
one
vote
they
had
a
minute
this
session
to
consider
the
much
greater
iniquity
of
no
women
having
any
vote
at
all
of
course
he
said
he
been
a
great
friend
to
woman
suffrage
until
he
got
shocked
with
our
tactics
she
smiled
broadly
asked
him
what
ever
done
to
show
his
friendship
did
seem
to
know
the
answer
to
that
what
strikes
me
most
about
men
is
their
being
so
illogical
lady
john
ulland
had
been
openly
surprised
even
enthusiastically
grateful
at
discovering
before
this
that
vida
levering
was
ready
to
help
her
with
some
of
the
unornamental
duties
that
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
ladies
of
england
do
know
what
that
discontented
creature
her
sister
means
by
saying
vida
is
so
unsympathetic
about
charity
work
neither
could
lady
john
neighbour
the
bishop
understand
reproach
had
not
his
young
kinswoman
charity
concerts
helped
to
rebuild
the
chantry
a
was
lord
john
contribution
then
showing
the
profundity
of
his
friendly
interest
does
she
find
some
nice
fella
to
marry
her
do
marry
so
early
nowadays
his
wife
reassured
him
lord
borrodaile
to
whom
vida
still
talked
freely
he
alone
had
some
understanding
of
the
changed
face
life
was
coming
to
wear
for
her
when
he
found
that
laughing
at
her
failed
of
the
desired
effect
he
offered
touching
testimony
to
his
affection
for
her
by
trying
to
understand
it
was
no
small
thing
for
a
man
like
borrodaile
who
for
the
rest
found
it
no
easier
than
others
of
his
class
rightly
to
interpret
the
modern
scene
as
looked
down
upon
from
the
narrow
lancet
of
the
mediÃ¦val
tower
which
was
his
mind
when
she
got
him
to
smile
at
her
report
of
the
humours
of
the
populace
he
did
so
against
his
will
shaking
his
long
van
dyke
head
and
saying
spoils
the
fun
for
me
to
think
of
your
being
there
i
have
a
quite
unconquerable
distrust
of
eccentricity
nothing
the
least
original
about
my
mixing
with
the
people
as
my
sister
would
call
them
the
women
of
my
world
would
often
go
slumming
the
only
difference
between
me
and
them
may
be
that
i
perhaps
shall
go
a
little
farther
that
all
i
devoutly
hope
you
wo
he
said
with
unusual
emphasis
the
proletariat
attend
to
the
affairs
of
the
proletariat
they
need
a
woman
like
you
not
only
need
what
more
they
are
getting
all
kinds
that
more
than
anything
else
that
shows
their
strength
the
miracle
it
is
to
see
the
way
they
all
work
together
women
the
poorest
and
most
ignorant
except
of
hardship
working
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
women
of
substance
and
position
oh
yes
they
are
winning
over
that
sort
teachers
and
university
graduates
a
whole
group
who
would
be
called
intellectuals
if
they
were
men
all
doing
what
men
have
said
women
could
never
do
pulling
together
and
oh
that
reminds
me
she
said
suddenly
smiling
as
one
who
has
thought
of
a
capital
joke
at
her
companion
expense
my
duty
to
warn
you
i
went
with
your
daughter
to
lunch
at
her
country
club
and
they
were
all
discussing
the
suffrage
a
good
dozen
and
sophia
well
sophia
came
out
in
a
new
light
i
want
you
please
to
believe
never
talked
to
her
said
borrodaile
with
an
unconscious
arrogance
wait
to
be
talked
to
she
takes
her
own
line
politics
are
a
tradition
with
our
women
i
found
her
reading
the
parliamentary
debates
when
she
was
fourteen
your
boys
are
they
equally
he
sighed
world
has
got
very
all
my
girls
are
boys
and
all
my
boys
are
girls
sophia
can
take
care
of
the
country
club
i
remember
how
we
scoffed
when
she
organized
it
had
precisely
the
effect
i
expected
takes
her
away
from
her
own
home
where
she
ought
to
be
wants
her
at
home
unblushingly
he
answered
do
you
never
there
yourself
he
blinked
you
are
in
your
garden
you
he
laughed
do
myself
she
went
on
do
belong
to
any
clubs
should
hope
not
indeed
where
should
i
go
for
tea
and
for
news
of
the
workings
of
the
zeitgeist
he
mocked
i
begin
to
see
what
women
clubs
are
for
for
the
dowdy
unattached
females
to
meet
and
gossip
in
to
hold
feeble
little
debates
in
to
listen
to
pettifogging
little
lectures
and
imagine
they
le
are
to
accustom
women
to
thinking
and
acting
together
while
you
and
i
have
been
laughing
at
them
they
been
building
up
a
huge
machinery
of
organization
ready
to
the
hand
of
the
chief
engineer
who
is
to
come
thought
horrible
or
not
i
do
despise
clubs
any
more
they
largely
responsible
for
the
new
corporate
spirit
among
women
he
pulled
himself
out
of
the
cavernous
comfort
of
his
chair
and
stood
glooming
in
front
of
the
screen
that
hid
the
fireless
grate
societies
leagues
they
all
devices
for
robbing
people
of
their
freedom
it
no
use
to
talk
to
me
i
one
of
the
few
individualists
left
in
the
world
i
never
wanted
in
my
life
to
belong
to
any
body
her
pealing
laughter
made
him
explain
smiling
any
corporation
was
what
i
meant
no
you
got
it
right
the
first
time
the
reason
that
in
spite
of
my
late
perversities
you
do
cast
me
off
is
because
i
one
of
the
few
women
who
do
make
claims
is
the
claim
of
the
community
that
i
resent
i
want
to
keep
clear
of
all
complication
i
want
to
be
really
free
i
could
never
have
pledged
myself
to
any
church
or
any
party
she
smiled
at
him
that
why
you
are
a
beautiful
and
ineffectual
angel
reason
i
never
did
is
because
i
care
about
liberty
the
thing
itself
you
are
in
danger
i
see
of
being
enamoured
of
the
name
in
thought
women
are
always
half
a
century
or
so
behind
what
voice
is
heard
in
europe
or
america
where
is
the
modern
kossuth
garibaldi
what
poet
goes
out
in
these
times
to
die
at
missolonghi
just
as
men
are
finding
out
the
vanity
of
the
old
dreams
the
women
seem
to
be
seizing
on
them
the
mass
of
intelligent
men
have
no
longing
for
political
power
if
a
sort
of
public
prominence
is
thrust
on
men
he
shrugged
as
if
his
shoulders
chafed
under
some
burden
their
they
curse
their
lot
i
suppose
it
all
so
new
to
the
woman
she
is
amused
she
even
i
his
lifted
hand
with
the
closed
fingers
suddenly
flung
open
advertised
the
difficulty
a
sane
person
found
in
crediting
the
uncanny
rumour
that
women
even
like
public
dinners
you
do
go
to
all
the
most
interesting
ones
of
my
burden
unlike
your
new
friends
there
nothing
i
hate
so
much
unless
it
is
having
to
make
a
speech
now
shall
i
stop
playing
at
and
just
say
that
when
i
hear
a
man
like
you
explaining
in
that
superior
way
how
immensely
he
i
seem
to
see
that
that
is
precisely
the
worst
indictment
against
your
class
if
special
privilege
breeds
that
it
merely
amused
him
to
see
that
she
was
forgetting
herself
he
sat
down
again
he
stretched
out
his
long
legs
and
interlaced
his
fingers
across
his
bulging
shirt
front
his
air
of
delicate
mockery
supplied
the
whip
vida
went
on
with
shining
eyes
to
be
able
to
care
and
to
work
and
to
sacrifice
if
to
get
those
impulses
out
of
life
you
must
carry
your
share
of
the
world
burden
then
no
intelligent
creature
can
be
sorry
the
day
is
coming
when
all
men
will
have
to
she
took
breath
a
little
frightened
to
see
where
she
was
going
to
he
encouraged
her
lazily
smiling
to
work
or
else
not
eat
under
your
hard
rule
i
would
have
to
work
much
my
appetite
is
mercifully
small
would
grow
if
you
sweated
for
your
bread
help
he
said
not
above
his
usual
tone
but
slowly
he
turned
his
fine
head
as
the
door
opened
he
fixed
the
amused
eyes
on
old
small
and
inoffensive
pillar
of
the
upper
house
is
in
the
act
of
being
abolished
is
she
talking
politics
she
never
favours
me
with
her
views
said
with
his
chimpanzee
smile
when
borrodaile
had
said
vida
followed
him
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
rather
on
my
mind
that
i
i
not
been
very
nice
to
you
i
would
not
hear
thine
enemy
say
so
i
been
rather
horrid
i
went
and
you
when
i
ought
to
have
amused
you
you
have
amused
me
his
eyes
shone
mischievously
very
well
she
took
the
gibe
in
good
part
offering
her
hand
again
my
dear
he
said
gently
great
fun
having
you
in
the
world
he
spoke
as
though
he
had
personally
arranged
this
provision
against
dulness
for
his
latter
end
the
next
evening
he
came
up
to
her
at
a
party
to
ask
why
she
had
absented
herself
from
a
dinner
the
night
before
where
he
expected
to
find
her
i
telephoned
in
the
morning
they
were
to
expect
me
were
you
doing
i
should
like
to
know
you
would
like
to
know
but
you
could
have
helped
laughing
if
you
seen
me
about
the
purlieus
of
battersea
me
who
with
with
that
notorious
suffragette
miss
ernestine
blunt
oh
have
stared
even
harder
if
you
seen
us
i
promise
you
she
with
a
leather
portfolio
under
one
arm
a
most
apparatus
and
a
in
one
hand
bell
he
put
his
hand
to
his
brow
as
one
who
feels
reason
reeling
holding
fast
to
the
clapper
so
that
we
should
affright
the
isle
out
of
season
i
if
you
please
carrying
an
armful
of
propagandist
literature
lord
do
you
say
these
orgies
take
place
the
fire
station
on
the
far
side
of
battersea
park
think
you
are
in
great
need
of
somebody
to
look
after
you
he
laughed
but
no
one
who
knew
him
could
mistake
his
seriousness
over
here
he
found
a
sofa
a
little
apart
from
the
crush
goes
with
you
on
these
raids
ernestine
or
rather
i
go
with
her
who
takes
care
of
you
knows
you
doing
this
kind
of
thing
and
you
it
a
secret
if
i
the
only
sane
person
who
knows
it
something
of
a
responsibility
wo
tell
you
about
it
if
it
oppresses
you
the
contrary
i
insist
on
your
telling
me
vida
smiled
reflectively
mode
of
procedure
strikes
one
as
highly
original
it
is
simple
beyond
anything
in
the
world
they
select
an
open
space
at
the
convergence
of
several
thoroughfares
if
possible
near
an
omnibus
centre
for
these
smaller
meetings
they
do
go
to
the
length
of
hiring
a
lorry
do
you
know
what
a
lorry
is
regret
to
say
my
education
in
that
direction
leaves
something
to
be
desired
week
i
was
equally
ignorant
i
can
tell
you
all
about
it
a
lorry
is
a
cart
or
a
big
van
with
the
top
off
but
such
elegancies
are
for
the
parks
in
battersea
you
go
into
some
modest
little
restaurant
and
you
say
will
you
lend
me
a
chair
this
is
a
surprise
for
the
battersea
restaurateur
poor
man
he
refuses
but
he
also
asks
questions
he
is
amazed
he
is
against
the
franchise
for
women
you
get
the
vote
well
we
must
have
something
says
ernestine
i
sure
it
is
against
your
principles
to
lend
a
woman
a
chair
she
lays
hands
on
one
i
never
said
you
could
have
one
of
my
but
you
meant
to
did
you
a
chair
one
of
the
things
men
have
always
been
ready
to
offer
us
thank
you
i
take
good
care
of
it
and
bring
it
back
quite
safe
out
marches
ernestine
with
the
enemy
property
she
carries
the
chair
into
the
road
and
plants
it
in
front
of
the
fire
station
usually
there
are
two
or
three
helpers
sometimes
ernestine
if
you
please
carries
the
meeting
entirely
on
her
own
shoulders
those
same
shoulders
being
about
so
wide
yes
she
quite
a
little
thing
if
there
are
helpers
she
sends
them
up
and
down
the
street
sowing
a
fresh
crop
of
handbills
when
ernestine
is
ready
to
begin
she
stands
up
on
that
chair
in
the
open
street
and
as
if
she
were
doing
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
she
begins
ringing
that
dinner
bell
naturally
people
stop
and
stare
and
draw
nearer
ernestine
tells
me
that
battersea
has
got
so
used
now
to
the
and
to
associating
it
with
our
meeting
that
as
far
off
as
they
hear
it
the
inhabitants
say
it
the
suffragettes
come
along
and
from
one
street
and
another
the
people
emerge
laughing
and
running
of
course
as
soon
as
there
is
a
little
crowd
that
attracts
more
and
so
the
snowball
grows
sometimes
the
traffic
is
impeded
oh
it
a
much
odder
world
than
i
had
suspected
for
a
moment
laughter
interrupted
the
narrative
the
salvation
army
does
approve
of
us
ernestine
says
and
the
socialists
do
love
us
either
we
always
take
their
audiences
away
from
them
poor
things
says
ernestine
with
a
sympathetic
air
do
i
say
because
vida
nodded
at
lord
borrodaile
must
know
ernestine
is
a
beguiler
a
beguiler
i
did
suppose
it
against
the
tradition
i
know
but
it
true
she
herself
however
does
seem
to
realize
her
beguilingness
it
is
any
one
in
particular
they
come
to
hear
she
says
it
just
that
a
woman
making
a
speech
is
so
much
more
interesting
than
a
man
making
a
speech
it
surprises
you
so
it
did
me
surprises
me
said
borrodaile
with
a
wave
of
his
long
hands
night
she
was
wonderful
our
ernestine
even
i
who
am
used
to
her
i
was
stirred
i
was
even
thrilled
she
had
that
crowd
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
when
she
wound
up
the
motion
is
carried
the
meeting
is
over
and
climbed
down
off
her
perch
the
mob
cheered
and
pressed
round
her
so
close
that
i
had
to
give
up
trying
to
join
her
i
extricated
myself
and
crossed
the
street
she
is
so
little
that
unless
she
on
a
chair
she
is
swallowed
up
for
a
long
time
i
could
see
her
i
did
know
whether
she
was
taking
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
people
who
want
to
join
the
union
or
whether
she
had
slipped
away
and
gone
home
till
i
saw
practically
the
whole
crowd
moving
off
after
her
up
the
street
i
followed
for
some
distance
on
the
she
went
calmly
on
her
way
a
tiny
figure
in
a
long
grey
coat
between
two
helpers
the
lancashire
and
the
cockney
working
woman
with
that
immense
tail
of
boys
and
men
and
a
few
women
all
following
after
quite
quiet
and
just
following
because
it
occur
to
them
to
do
anything
else
in
a
way
she
was
still
exercising
her
hold
over
her
meeting
i
saw
presently
there
was
one
person
in
front
of
her
a
great
big
fellow
he
looked
like
a
carter
he
was
carrying
home
the
chair
they
both
laughed
she
found
a
advocate
in
you
apparently
said
borrodaile
if
only
you
could
her
trudging
along
apparently
quite
oblivious
of
her
quaint
following
dinner
bell
in
one
hand
leather
case
piled
high
with
tracts
on
the
other
arm
some
of
the
leaflets
sliding
off
tumbling
on
to
the
pavement
vida
laughed
as
she
recalled
the
scene
dozens
of
hands
darting
out
to
help
her
to
recover
her
precious
property
after
the
chair
had
been
returned
the
crowd
thinned
and
i
crossed
over
to
her
in
that
borrodaile
ejaculated
ernestine
the
quaintness
all
to
herself
oh
no
vida
agreed
thought
of
you
and
how
you
look
if
you
had
come
on
us
suddenly
after
the
crowd
had
melted
and
the
helpers
had
vanished
into
the
night
we
went
on
together
all
the
way
from
the
battersea
fire
station
to
sloane
square
did
ernestine
and
i
walk
talking
reform
last
night
you
laugh
so
do
i
but
not
at
ernestine
she
a
most
wonderful
person
i
sometimes
ask
myself
if
the
world
will
ever
know
half
how
wonderful
you
for
instance
you
have
after
all
i
said
you
have
i
do
doubt
i
do
think
i
ever
doubted
that
women
have
a
facility
in
speech
no
no
i
not
gibing
i
do
even
doubt
they
can
as
you
say
sway
and
control
crowds
but
i
maintain
it
is
very
bad
for
the
women
is
it
bad
can
it
fail
to
be
all
that
horrible
publicity
all
that
concentrating
of
crude
popular
interest
on
themselves
believe
me
nobody
who
watches
a
public
career
carefully
but
sees
the
demoralizing
effect
the
limelight
has
even
on
men
characters
and
i
suppose
admit
that
men
are
less
delicately
organized
than
women
can
only
say
i
seen
the
sort
of
thing
you
mean
in
our
world
where
a
good
many
women
have
only
themselves
to
think
about
i
looked
in
vain
for
those
evil
effects
among
the
suffrage
women
it
almost
seems
on
the
contrary
as
if
there
were
something
ennobling
in
working
for
a
public
cause
i
ca
say
i
observed
it
not
among
the
political
women
of
my
acquaintance
you
only
know
the
old
kind
yes
the
kind
whose
idea
of
influence
is
to
make
men
fall
in
love
with
them
whose
idea
of
working
is
to
put
on
a
smart
gown
and
smile
their
prettiest
no
i
agree
that
necessarily
ennobling
see
it
the
new
taste
in
manners
and
the
new
arts
of
persuasion
that
make
the
ideal
women
and
with
an
ironic
little
bow
impassioned
convert
bound
to
admit
she
said
stoutly
i
think
the
suffrage
movement
in
england
has
the
advantage
of
being
engineered
by
a
very
remarkable
set
of
women
not
in
ability
alone
but
in
dignity
of
character
people
will
never
know
i
sometimes
think
how
much
the
movement
has
owed
to
being
taken
in
hand
by
just
these
particular
women
i
do
pretend
they
the
average
they
very
far
above
the
average
and
what
the
world
will
owe
to
them
i
very
much
doubt
if
even
the
future
will
know
but
i
seem
to
be
the
only
one
who
minds
she
laughed
could
take
my
oath
never
give
the
matter
a
thought
one
thing
she
leaned
forward
and
then
checked
herself
i
talked
about
them
enough
she
opened
her
fan
and
looked
about
the
crowded
room
what
you
were
going
to
i
reconciled
i
see
what
coming
coming
go
on
she
looked
at
him
a
little
perplexed
over
the
top
of
her
fan
was
only
going
to
say
that
what
struck
me
particularly
in
that
girl
for
instance
is
her
inaccessibility
to
flattery
i
watched
her
with
men
course
she
knew
you
were
watching
her
she
no
doubt
thinks
the
eyes
of
the
world
are
upon
her
the
contrary
it
her
unselfconsciousness
that
the
most
surprising
thing
about
her
or
no
it
something
more
interesting
even
than
that
she
is
conscious
in
a
way
of
the
hold
she
has
on
the
public
but
it
has
any
of
the
deteriorating
effect
you
were
deprecating
i
been
moved
once
or
twice
to
congratulate
her
she
takes
it
as
unmoved
as
a
child
it
just
as
if
you
said
to
a
little
thing
of
three
what
a
clever
baby
you
are
or
you
got
the
most
beautiful
eyes
in
the
world
the
child
would
realize
that
you
meant
well
that
you
were
being
pleasant
but
it
would
think
about
either
its
cleverness
or
its
eyes
it
like
that
with
ernestine
when
i
said
to
her
you
made
an
astoundingly
good
speech
the
best
i
heard
even
you
make
she
looked
at
me
with
a
sort
of
expression
without
a
glimmer
of
personal
vanity
when
i
was
so
as
not
to
drop
the
subject
when
i
ventured
to
say
something
more
about
that
great
gift
of
hers
she
interrupted
me
with
a
little
laugh
it
a
sign
of
grace
in
you
not
to
get
tired
of
our
speeches
she
said
i
suppose
we
repeat
ourselves
a
good
deal
you
see
that
just
what
we
got
to
do
we
got
to
it
but
the
fact
is
that
she
does
repeat
herself
that
she
always
fresh
and
stimulating
because
i
suppose
it
because
she
always
thinking
of
the
great
impersonal
object
and
talking
about
it
out
of
her
own
eager
heart
ernestine
she
as
unhackneyed
as
a
spring
morning
very
well
i
go
where
for
he
still
sat
there
to
hear
your
paragon
i
seen
that
was
what
you
were
leading
up
to
no
i
do
think
i
want
you
to
go
yes
you
do
i
knew
you
make
me
sooner
or
later
do
be
afraid
she
stood
up
not
afraid
i
eager
he
laughed
she
shook
her
head
i
never
take
you
not
it
is
all
ernestine
and
skittles
and
because
you
make
me
keenly
alive
again
to
all
sorts
of
things
that
i
see
now
matter
things
that
have
lost
some
of
their
power
to
trouble
me
but
that
i
should
feel
for
you
sort
of
oddities
uglinesses
things
that
abound
i
told
at
all
meetings
and
that
yet
somehow
we
like
to
eliminate
from
quite
on
the
old
angel
theory
no
i
wo
take
you
chapter
xiii
the
following
afternoon
at
five
the
carelessly
dressed
rather
slouching
figure
of
lord
borrodaile
might
have
been
seen
walking
along
the
thames
embankment
in
the
neighbourhood
of
pimlico
pier
he
passed
without
seeing
the
only
other
person
visible
at
that
quiet
hour
one
of
the
like
himself
but
save
in
that
respect
sufficiently
unlike
the
earl
of
borrodaile
was
the
grimy
unshaven
tramp
collapsed
in
one
corner
of
the
municipal
bench
lord
borrodaile
leaned
heavily
on
one
of
the
stout
scrolls
of
ironwork
which
repeated
at
regular
intervals
on
each
side
divided
the
seat
into
six
compartments
no
call
for
any
one
to
notice
such
a
man
there
are
so
many
of
them
in
these
piping
times
of
peace
and
prosperity
then
too
they
go
crawling
about
our
world
protected
from
notice
as
the
creatures
are
who
take
their
colouring
from
bark
or
leaf
or
arctic
snows
so
these
other
forms
of
life
subdued
to
the
hues
of
the
dusty
roads
they
travel
and
the
unswept
spaces
where
they
sleep
over
these
the
eye
glides
unseeing
as
little
interested
in
the
gentleman
as
the
gentleman
was
in
him
the
wastrel
contemplated
the
river
with
grimly
speculative
eye
but
when
suddenly
borrodaile
sauntering
figure
came
to
a
standstill
near
the
lower
end
of
the
bench
the
tramp
turned
his
head
and
watched
dully
the
gloveless
hands
cross
one
over
the
other
on
the
knob
of
the
planted
umbrella
the
bent
head
one
hand
raised
now
groping
about
the
waistcoat
lighting
upon
what
it
sought
and
raising
a
through
which
he
read
the
legend
scrawled
in
chalk
upon
the
pavement
with
a
faint
saturnine
smile
lord
borrodaile
dropped
the
glass
and
took
his
bearings
he
consulted
his
watch
and
walked
on
upon
his
return
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
viewed
the
same
prospect
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
the
tramp
still
stared
at
the
river
but
on
his
side
of
the
bench
at
the
other
end
sat
a
lady
reading
a
book
between
the
two
motionless
figures
and
the
parapet
a
group
of
dirty
children
were
wrangling
lord
borrodaile
crossed
the
wide
street
and
paused
a
moment
just
behind
the
lady
he
leaned
forward
as
if
to
speak
to
her
across
the
middle
division
of
the
bench
but
he
reconsidered
and
turning
his
back
to
her
sat
down
and
drew
an
evening
paper
out
of
his
pocket
he
was
so
little
like
that
glittering
figment
the
peer
of
popular
imagination
that
the
careless
sobriety
of
dress
and
air
in
the
person
of
this
third
occupant
of
the
capacious
double
bench
struck
an
even
less
arresting
note
than
the
frank
wretchedness
of
the
other
man
presently
one
of
the
children
burst
out
crying
and
continued
to
howl
lustily
till
the
lady
looked
up
from
her
page
and
inquired
what
was
the
matter
the
unwashed
infant
stared
at
this
intruder
upon
her
grief
instead
of
answering
she
regarded
the
lady
with
a
bored
astonishment
as
who
should
say
what
are
you
interrupting
me
for
just
in
the
middle
of
a
good
yell
she
then
took
up
the
strain
as
nearly
as
possible
where
she
had
left
off
she
was
getting
on
very
well
with
this
second
attempt
at
a
demonstration
until
miss
levering
made
some
mention
of
a
penny
whereupon
the
infant
again
suspended
her
more
violent
manifestations
though
the
tears
kept
rolling
down
after
various
attempts
on
the
lady
part
the
little
girl
was
induced
to
come
and
occupy
the
middle
place
on
the
river
side
of
the
bench
between
vida
and
the
tramp
while
the
lady
held
the
penny
in
her
hand
and
the
still
weeping
child
borrodaile
sat
quietly
listening
behind
his
paper
when
the
child
could
answer
those
questions
that
were
of
a
general
nature
the
tramp
did
and
the
three
were
presently
quite
a
pleasant
family
party
the
only
person
of
it
was
the
petrified
gentleman
on
the
other
side
a
few
minutes
before
the
arrival
of
the
suffragettes
two
nondescript
young
men
in
a
larky
mood
appeared
with
the
announcement
that
seen
of
them
at
the
top
of
ranelagh
street
be
the
little
said
the
tramp
to
nobody
do
ketch
bein
late
no
cheeky
little
devil
remarked
one
of
the
young
men
offering
a
new
light
upon
the
royal
virtue
of
punctuality
but
from
the
enthusiasm
with
which
they
availed
themselves
of
the
rest
of
lord
borrodaile
side
of
the
bench
it
was
obvious
they
had
hurried
to
the
spot
with
the
intention
of
securing
front
seats
at
the
show
course
it
ai
goin
to
be
as
much
fun
as
the
park
sunday
aufternoons
jim
wrightson
goes
to
them
keeps
things
lively
does
up
a
shindy
do
we
ca
do
nothin
ai
enough
whether
of
space
or
of
spirited
young
men
he
did
not
specify
as
they
lit
their
cigarettes
the
company
received
further
additions
one
obviously
otherwise
employed
than
with
politics
her
progress
was
it
symbolic
was
necessarily
slow
for
a
small
child
clung
to
her
skirt
and
she
trundled
a
sickly
boy
in
a
the
still
sniffling
person
in
possession
of
the
middle
seat
on
the
other
side
her
anxious
and
watery
eye
fixed
on
the
penny
was
told
by
miss
levering
to
make
room
for
the
the
child
way
of
doing
so
was
to
crowd
closer
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
fascinating
coin
but
that
mandate
to
room
had
proved
a
conversational
opening
through
which
poured
or
trickled
rather
the
mother
sorry
little
history
her
husband
was
employed
in
the
clothing
department
of
the
army
and
navy
stores
yes
nine
years
now
he
was
considered
very
lucky
to
keep
his
place
when
the
staff
was
reduced
but
the
costliness
of
raising
the
children
it
was
well
that
three
were
dead
if
she
had
it
all
to
do
over
again
no
no
the
seeming
heartlessness
with
which
she
envisaged
the
of
her
babies
contrasted
strangely
with
her
patient
tenderness
to
the
querulous
boy
in
the
meanwhile
miss
levering
had
not
forgotten
her
earlier
acquaintance
as
the
wan
mother
watched
the
end
of
the
transaction
which
left
the
sniffler
now
quite
consoled
in
possession
of
the
modest
coin
she
said
naÃ¯vely
anybody
gives
one
of
my
children
a
penny
i
always
save
half
of
it
for
them
the
next
day
vida
levering
turned
her
head
away
and
in
so
doing
met
lord
borrodaile
eyes
over
the
back
of
the
bench
she
gave
a
faint
start
of
surprise
and
then
saves
half
of
it
was
all
she
said
borrodaile
glancing
shrewdly
over
the
further
augmented
gathering
asked
the
invariable
question
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
so
few
women
are
here
to
show
their
interest
in
a
matter
that
supposed
to
concern
them
so
much
vida
craned
her
head
you
only
one
borrodaile
mocking
voice
went
on
this
an
instance
of
your
sex
indifference
to
the
whole
thing
is
it
equally
an
instance
of
man
keenness
about
public
questions
he
could
forbear
adding
in
a
whisper
such
a
question
and
such
men
vida
still
craned
searching
in
vain
for
refutation
in
female
form
but
she
did
not
take
her
failure
lying
down
men
who
are
here
she
said
great
majority
of
men
at
all
meetings
seem
to
be
loafers
woman
whatever
else
she
may
or
may
not
be
is
a
loafer
through
borrodaile
laugh
she
persisted
woman
always
seems
to
have
something
to
do
even
if
it
of
the
silliest
description
yes
and
if
she
a
decent
person
at
all
not
hanging
about
at
street
corners
waiting
for
some
diversion
bad
not
bad
i
see
you
are
catching
the
truly
martial
spirit
them
ai
it
one
of
the
young
men
jumped
up
vida
turned
her
head
in
time
to
see
the
meeting
between
two
girls
and
a
woman
arriving
from
opposite
directions
she
whispered
ernestine
with
the
pile
of
handbills
on
her
arm
the
lady
sent
out
smiles
and
signals
of
welcome
with
a
lifted
hand
the
busy
propagandist
took
no
notice
she
was
talking
to
her
two
companions
one
of
whom
the
younger
with
head
on
one
side
kept
shooting
out
glances
half
provocative
half
appealing
towards
lord
borrodaile
and
the
young
men
she
seemed
as
keenly
alive
to
the
fact
of
these
male
presences
as
the
two
other
women
seemed
oblivious
is
the
one
asked
lord
borrodaile
you
were
telling
me
about
ernestine
blunt
the
one
in
the
long
alpaca
coat
does
look
so
very
devilish
he
laughed
after
an
impatient
moment
hope
that
devilishness
might
develop
he
said
has
seen
you
yet
yes
she
has
she
is
as
overjoyed
as
she
ought
to
be
be
surprised
to
know
she
was
expected
to
be
overjoyed
are
you
very
good
to
her
she
been
rather
good
to
me
though
she
does
take
very
much
stock
in
me
does
she
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
people
that
interest
ernestine
those
who
be
active
in
carrying
on
the
propaganda
and
those
who
have
yet
to
be
converted
i
disappointed
he
teased
perceiving
how
keen
his
friend
was
that
he
should
not
be
other
one
would
be
more
likely
to
convert
you
only
say
that
because
the
other
one
tall
and
makes
eyes
vida
denounced
him
to
his
evident
diversion
whatever
his
reasons
were
the
young
men
seemed
to
share
his
preference
they
were
watching
the
languishing
young
woman
who
in
turn
kept
glancing
at
them
ernestine
having
finished
what
she
was
saying
made
her
way
to
where
miss
levering
sat
not
it
would
appear
for
any
purpose
so
frivolous
as
saying
good
evening
but
to
deposit
what
were
left
of
the
handbills
and
the
precious
portfolio
in
the
care
of
one
well
known
by
now
to
have
a
motherly
oversight
of
such
properties
lord
borrodaile
eyes
narrowed
with
amusement
as
he
watched
the
hurried
pantomime
instead
of
you
as
vida
meekly
accepted
the
incongruous
and
by
no
means
light
burden
are
short
of
speakers
said
ernestine
help
us
out
wo
you
as
though
it
were
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
lord
borrodaile
half
rose
in
protest
said
vida
wo
speak
till
i
have
something
to
say
should
have
thought
there
was
plenty
to
said
the
girl
for
you
you
know
such
a
lot
smiled
her
new
friend
must
get
some
knowledge
too
before
i
try
to
stand
up
and
speechify
now
we
need
help
there
be
plenty
but
i
not
going
to
worry
you
she
caught
herself
up
then
confidentially
got
one
new
helper
that
we
great
hopes
of
she
joined
one
who
can
speak
she
speak
i
dare
say
by
and
by
does
she
do
in
the
meantime
to
to
account
for
your
enthusiasm
was
implied
show
she
a
helper
subscribes
expect
she
subscribe
too
she
takes
such
an
interest
plenty
of
courage
too
do
you
know
the
voice
dropped
but
she
belongs
to
rather
stodgy
people
bothers
about
respectability
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
she
came
along
with
me
this
afternoon
distributing
handbills
all
over
the
city
for
two
hours
not
many
women
of
her
kind
are
ready
to
do
the
first
thing
i
dare
say
not
said
vida
humbly
one
thing
i
thought
a
very
good
sign
ernestine
bent
lower
in
her
enthusiasm
we
got
to
finsbury
circus
she
said
ernestine
paused
as
if
struck
afresh
by
the
merits
of
the
new
recruit
said
me
a
piece
of
chalk
what
did
she
want
with
borrodaile
too
leaned
nearer
saw
me
beginning
to
write
meeting
notices
on
the
stones
of
course
the
people
stopped
and
stared
and
laughed
but
she
instead
of
getting
shy
and
pretending
she
had
anything
to
do
with
me
she
took
the
chalk
and
wrote
votes
for
women
all
over
the
pavement
of
finsbury
circus
ernestine
paused
a
moment
that
miss
levering
might
applaud
the
new
thought
that
a
very
good
sign
in
such
a
respectable
person
yes
a
most
encouraging
sign
is
it
the
one
in
mauve
who
did
that
that
i
forget
her
name
oh
thomas
she
new
too
have
to
let
her
speak
if
you
wo
she
said
a
trifle
anxiously
thomas
by
all
means
murmured
borrodaile
as
ernestine
seeing
her
plea
was
hopeless
turned
away
vida
caught
her
by
the
coat
are
the
others
the
rest
of
your
speakers
up
and
down
getting
ready
for
the
general
election
why
we
have
to
break
in
new
people
oh
she
sent
me
some
notes
that
girl
did
i
must
give
them
back
to
her
ernestine
stooped
and
opened
the
portfolio
on
miss
levering
lap
she
rummaged
through
the
bulging
pockets
thought
said
miss
levering
with
obvious
misgiving
thought
i
had
seen
that
creature
before
she
get
over
all
that
ernestine
whispered
have
much
opinion
of
our
crowds
but
they
can
teach
people
a
lot
them
not
to
hold
their
heads
like
a
broken
lily
knock
all
sorts
of
nonsense
out
and
stiffen
them
up
wonderfully
she
found
the
scrap
of
paper
and
shut
the
portfolio
with
a
snap
she
stood
up
took
in
the
fact
of
the
audience
having
increased
and
a
policeman
in
the
offing
she
summoned
her
allies
nearly
time
for
those
army
and
navy
workers
to
come
out
the
men
will
come
first
she
said
five
minutes
after
they
let
the
women
out
i
begin
and
then
i
think
you
better
speak
next
she
said
handing
the
young
woman
her
notes
seem
all
right
but
miss
blunt
she
whispered
so
nervous
how
am
i
ever
to
face
all
those
men
find
it
quite
easy
when
once
you
are
started
said
ernestine
in
a
quiet
undertone
i
so
afraid
that
just
out
of
pure
nervousness
i
say
the
wrong
thing
you
do
i
be
there
returned
the
chairman
a
little
grimly
it
the
very
first
time
in
my
life
look
here
ernestine
reached
out
past
this
person
who
was
luxuriating
in
her
own
emotions
and
drew
the
ample
mauve
matron
into
the
official
group
close
to
where
miss
levering
sat
nursing
the
handbills
easy
enough
talking
to
these
little
meetings
they
quite
good
and
quiet
not
a
bit
like
hyde
park
one
of
the
young
men
poked
the
other
they
exchanged
looks
there
are
three
things
we
all
agree
it
just
as
well
to
keep
in
mind
not
to
talk
about
ourselves
she
measured
off
the
of
wisdom
with
a
slim
forefinger
to
say
anything
against
the
press
and
if
possible
remember
to
praise
the
police
the
police
ejaculated
the
mauve
matron
said
ernestine
softly
but
not
so
easily
was
the
tide
of
indignation
stemmed
saw
with
my
own
eyes
began
the
woman
yes
but
she
lowered
her
voice
borrodaile
had
to
strain
to
catch
what
she
said
see
it
no
use
beating
our
heads
against
a
stone
wall
a
movement
that
means
to
be
popular
must
have
the
police
on
its
side
after
all
they
do
very
well
considering
they
men
demanded
the
matron
ernestine
went
on
if
they
behaved
ten
times
worse
not
a
bit
of
good
to
antagonize
the
police
or
the
press
if
they
our
friends
we
got
to
make
them
our
friends
they
both
better
than
they
were
they
must
be
encouraged
said
the
wise
young
daniel
with
a
little
nod
then
as
she
saw
or
felt
that
the
big
matron
might
elude
her
vigilance
and
break
out
into
indiscretion
we
had
a
reporter
in
from
the
only
he
said
the
public
seems
to
have
got
tired
of
reading
that
you
spit
and
scratch
and
prod
policemen
with
your
hatpins
now
do
you
mind
saying
what
is
it
you
really
do
i
told
him
to
come
here
this
afternoon
now
when
opened
the
meeting
tell
him
the
young
woman
patted
her
fringe
you
suppose
be
in
the
how
dreadful
during
this
little
interchange
a
procession
of
men
streaming
homeward
in
their
hundreds
came
walking
down
the
embankment
in
twos
and
threes
or
singly
shambling
past
the
loosely
gathered
assemblage
about
the
bench
the
child
on
the
riverward
side
still
clutching
its
penny
was
unceremoniously
ousted
as
soon
as
ernestine
had
mounted
the
seat
the
slackly
held
gathering
showed
signs
of
cohesion
the
waiting
units
drew
closer
the
dingy
procession
slowed
the
workmen
looking
up
at
the
young
face
with
the
fluttering
sycamore
shadows
printed
on
its
pink
and
white
grinned
or
frowned
but
many
halted
and
listened
through
the
early
part
of
the
speech
miss
levering
kept
looking
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
to
see
what
effect
it
had
on
borrodaile
but
borrodaile
gave
no
sign
ernestine
was
trying
to
make
it
clear
what
a
gain
it
would
be
especially
to
this
class
if
women
had
the
vote
an
uphill
task
to
catch
and
hold
the
attention
of
those
tired
workmen
they
had
stopped
there
to
be
made
to
think
if
they
were
going
to
be
amused
they
go
home
a
certain
number
did
go
home
after
pausing
to
ask
the
young
reformer
more
or
less
why
she
did
get
married
lord
borrodaile
had
privately
asked
for
enlightenment
on
the
same
score
vida
had
only
smiled
one
man
varied
the
monotony
by
demanding
why
if
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
working
class
to
have
women
voting
why
did
the
labour
party
take
up
the
question
of
the
labour
party
have
ernestine
told
them
the
others
are
afraid
they
been
told
that
women
are
such
slaves
to
convention
such
timid
creatures
they
know
their
own
women
are
but
they
doubtful
about
the
rest
the
labour
party
you
know
she
spoke
with
a
condescending
forbearance
labour
party
is
young
yet
and
knows
what
it
like
to
feel
timid
some
of
the
labour
men
have
the
wild
notion
that
women
would
all
vote
conservative
they
would
but
ernestine
shook
her
head
we
are
trying
to
show
the
people
who
say
that
that
even
if
they
were
right
it
would
be
no
excuse
whatever
for
denying
our
claim
to
vote
whichever
way
we
thought
best
while
we
are
going
to
the
root
of
the
principle
of
the
thing
another
lot
of
logical
gentlemen
are
sure
to
say
oh
it
would
never
do
to
have
women
voting
they
be
going
in
for
all
sorts
of
reforms
and
the
whole
place
would
be
turned
upside
down
so
between
the
men
who
think
we
all
turn
tory
and
the
men
who
are
sure
we
all
be
socialists
we
do
seem
likely
to
get
very
far
unless
we
do
something
to
show
them
we
mean
to
have
it
for
no
better
reason
than
just
that
we
human
beings
she
delightfully
direct
whispered
miss
levering
eager
to
cull
some
modest
flower
of
praise
direct
enough
his
tone
so
little
satisfied
the
pride
of
the
other
woman
that
she
was
almost
prepared
for
the
slighting
accent
in
which
he
presently
asked
this
the
sort
of
thing
supposed
to
convert
people
to
a
great
constitutional
change
is
our
women
would
get
the
vote
a
workman
called
out
the
rich
women
it
only
the
rich
men
who
have
the
vote
demanded
ernestine
know
it
is
we
are
fighting
to
get
the
franchise
on
precisely
the
same
terms
as
men
for
several
moments
the
wrangle
went
on
wives
have
a
vote
she
showed
how
that
could
be
made
a
matter
of
adjustment
she
quoted
the
lodger
franchise
and
the
decision
vida
kept
glancing
at
borrodaile
as
still
he
made
no
sign
course
the
lady
whispered
across
the
back
of
the
bench
course
you
think
she
an
abomination
but
she
paused
for
a
handsome
disavowal
borrodaile
looked
at
the
eager
face
vida
for
miss
blunt
was
calm
as
a
may
morning
as
he
did
not
instantly
speak
you
ca
deny
she
got
extremely
good
wits
he
seemed
to
relent
before
such
persuasiveness
got
a
delicious
little
face
he
admitted
thinking
to
say
the
most
her
that
scarcely
the
point
always
the
point
the
principle
that
at
stake
ernestine
was
saying
most
socialist
among
us
would
welcome
the
enfranchisement
of
six
duchesses
or
all
the
women
born
with
red
hair
we
do
care
on
what
plea
the
entering
wedge
gets
in
but
let
me
tell
you
there
are
any
people
on
earth
so
blind
to
their
own
interests
as
just
you
working
men
when
you
oppose
or
when
you
are
indifferent
to
women
having
votes
all
women
suffer
but
it
the
women
of
your
class
who
suffer
most
it
do
you
men
know
why
it
notorious
that
the
women
of
the
working
class
are
worse
sweated
even
than
the
men
they
are
you
do
believe
me
them
here
they
come
it
was
well
contrived
that
point
it
struck
full
in
the
face
of
the
women
who
had
just
been
let
out
know
and
you
men
know
the
speaker
nailed
her
advantage
even
the
government
that
being
forced
to
become
a
model
employer
where
men
are
concerned
the
very
is
responsible
for
sweating
thousands
of
women
in
state
employments
we
know
and
you
know
that
in
those
over
yonder
these
very
women
have
been
sitting
weighed
down
by
the
rumour
of
a
reduction
in
their
wages
already
so
much
below
the
men
they
sat
there
wondering
whether
they
can
risk
a
strike
women
it
notorious
she
flung
it
out
on
a
wave
of
passion
everywhere
suffer
most
from
the
evils
of
our
social
system
why
not
they
had
no
hand
in
it
our
social
system
is
the
work
of
men
yet
we
must
work
to
uphold
it
this
system
that
crushes
us
we
must
swell
the
budget
we
must
help
to
pay
the
bill
what
we
all
been
what
fools
we
are
if
we
do
do
something
up
rows
and
goin
to
no
good
while
she
justified
the
course
that
led
to
holloway
piffle
they
interjected
one
man
called
out
have
some
respect
for
you
if
you
carried
a
bomb
into
the
house
of
commons
but
a
miserable
little
scuffle
with
the
police
a
gentleman
who
is
inciting
us
to
carry
bombs
now
that
shocks
me
the
crowd
recovered
its
spirits
at
the
notion
of
the
shocked
been
dreadfully
browbeaten
about
our
tactics
but
that
gentleman
with
his
bad
advice
makes
our
tactics
sound
as
innocent
and
reasonable
as
they
actually
are
when
you
talk
in
that
wild
way
about
bombs
you
i
may
be
a
hooligan
she
held
up
the
delicate
face
with
excellent
effect
you
do
shock
me
it
wore
well
this
exquisitely
humorous
jest
about
shocking
a
suffragette
the
whole
crowd
was
one
grin
specially
shocked
when
i
hear
a
advocating
such
a
thing
you
men
have
other
and
more
civilized
ways
of
getting
the
government
to
pay
attention
to
abuses
now
listen
to
what
i
saying
for
it
the
justification
of
everything
we
are
going
to
do
in
the
future
we
get
what
we
asking
for
it
this
our
justification
is
that
men
even
poor
men
have
that
powerful
leverage
of
the
vote
you
men
have
no
right
to
resort
to
violence
you
have
a
better
way
we
have
way
but
agitation
a
government
that
refuses
cheers
for
the
liberals
hip
hip
friend
i
see
you
are
young
says
ernestine
wot
are
you
the
young
man
hurled
back
i
got
my
political
education
when
was
young
and
innocent
like
this
gentleman
who
still
pins
his
faith
to
the
liberals
i
too
hoped
great
things
from
them
my
friends
it
a
frame
of
mind
we
outlive
and
her
friends
shrieked
with
delight
it
one
way
for
a
girl
to
amuse
herself
till
she
gets
married
said
borrodaile
that
just
what
the
hooligans
all
say
laughed
vida
like
you
they
think
that
if
a
woman
wants
justice
for
other
women
she
must
have
a
grievance
of
her
own
i
heard
them
ask
ernestine
in
battersea
she
has
valiant
friends
there
oo
feelin
they
say
tell
me
and
i
punch
but
you
are
here
to
listen
to
vida
caught
herself
up
is
about
the
deputation
of
women
that
waited
on
the
prime
minister
get
nothin
out
of
him
somebody
shouted
yes
we
did
we
got
the
best
speech
in
favour
of
woman
suffrage
that
any
of
us
ever
heard
haw
clever
ol
fox
just
buttered
up
but
do
do
nothin
yes
he
did
something
gave
us
advice
they
all
laughed
together
at
that
in
the
most
friendly
spirit
in
the
world
nice
pieces
ernestine
held
up
each
hand
very
much
like
a
school
child
rejoicing
over
slices
of
cake
we
are
taking
she
drew
in
a
hand
other
we
are
she
let
it
fall
said
we
must
win
people
to
our
way
of
thinking
we
doing
it
at
a
rate
that
must
astonish
if
it
does
even
embarrass
him
the
other
piece
of
distinguished
advice
he
gave
us
was
of
a
more
doubtful
character
her
small
hands
took
it
up
gingerly
again
she
seemed
to
weigh
it
there
in
the
face
of
the
multitude
prime
minister
said
we
must
have
patience
she
threw
the
worthless
counsel
into
the
air
and
tossed
contempt
after
it
is
man
oldest
advice
to
woman
our
trouble
fur
nothin
groaned
an
impish
boy
see
now
that
patience
has
been
our
bane
if
it
had
been
for
this
same
numbing
slavish
patience
we
would
be
standing
before
the
world
political
outcasts
catalogued
with
felons
and
lunatics
peers
called
a
voice
are
with
patience
said
ernestine
hotly
for
that
reason
there
is
at
last
some
hope
for
the
women
cause
now
miss
scammell
will
speak
to
you
a
strange
thing
happened
when
miss
scammell
got
up
she
seemed
to
leave
her
attractiveness
such
as
it
was
behind
when
she
climbed
up
on
the
bench
standing
mute
on
a
level
with
the
rest
her
head
deprecatingly
on
one
side
she
had
pleased
up
there
on
the
bench
presuming
to
teach
she
woke
a
latent
cruelty
in
the
mob
they
saw
she
could
take
care
of
herself
and
so
they
for
her
the
very
same
young
men
who
had
got
up
and
given
her
a
choice
of
the
seats
they
had
been
at
the
pains
to
come
early
to
secure
to
be
sure
when
with
a
smile
she
had
sat
down
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
in
the
vacated
place
of
one
of
them
the
other
boy
promptly
withdrew
with
his
pal
it
would
have
been
too
compromising
to
remain
alongside
the
charmer
but
when
miss
scammell
stood
up
on
that
same
bench
she
was
assumed
to
have
left
the
realm
of
smiles
and
meaning
looks
where
she
was
mistress
and
at
home
she
had
ventured
out
into
the
open
not
only
without
the
sword
of
pointed
speech
that
falls
to
few
but
this
young
lady
had
not
even
the
armour
of
absolute
earnestness
when
she
found
that
smiling
piteously
do
she
proceeded
looking
more
and
more
like
a
scared
white
rabbit
to
tell
about
the
horrible
cases
of
among
the
girls
in
certain
china
and
earthenware
works
all
that
she
had
to
say
was
true
and
significant
enough
but
it
was
no
use
they
jeered
and
howled
her
down
for
pure
pleasure
in
her
misery
she
trembled
and
lost
her
thread
she
very
nearly
cried
vida
wondered
that
the
little
chairwoman
fly
to
the
rescue
but
ernestine
sat
quite
unmoved
looking
in
her
lap
exhibition
said
borrodaile
moving
about
uneasily
the
odd
thing
was
that
miss
scammell
kept
on
with
her
prickly
task
do
you
make
her
sit
down
vida
whispered
to
miss
blunt
i
got
to
see
what
she
made
of
surely
you
see
she
awful
half
so
bad
as
lots
of
men
when
they
first
try
if
she
weathers
this
she
be
a
speaker
some
day
at
last
having
told
her
story
through
the
interruptions
told
it
badly
brokenly
but
to
the
end
having
given
proofs
that
among
women
was
on
the
increase
and
read
out
from
her
poor
crumpled
shaking
notes
the
statistics
of
infant
and
mortality
the
unhappy
new
helper
sat
down
miss
blunt
leaned
over
and
whispered
all
right
i
was
wrong
this
is
nearly
as
bad
as
hyde
park
and
with
that
jumped
up
to
give
the
crowd
a
piece
of
her
mind
they
sniggered
but
they
quieted
down
all
but
one
you
are
the
gentleman
you
there
with
the
polo
cap
who
believe
in
giving
a
fair
hearing
i
would
like
to
ask
that
man
who
thinks
himself
so
superior
one
in
the
grey
cap
whether
he
is
capable
of
standing
up
here
on
this
bench
and
addressing
the
crowd
hear
get
on
the
bench
up
with
him
a
slight
scrimmage
and
an
agitated
man
was
observed
to
be
seeking
refuge
on
the
outskirts
as
miss
scammell
was
she
made
me
rather
ashamed
of
myself
vida
confided
to
borrodaile
he
said
sympathetically
always
makes
one
rather
ashamed
even
if
it
a
man
making
public
failure
that
was
what
i
meant
at
least
tried
but
i
i
feel
i
a
type
of
all
the
idle
women
the
world
over
leaving
it
to
the
poor
and
the
to
keep
the
world
from
slipping
into
chaos
he
inquired
genially
she
had
heard
her
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
chairwoman
all
they
got
ernestine
vida
exulted
under
her
breath
borrodaile
fell
to
studying
this
aspect
of
the
face
whose
every
change
he
had
thought
he
knew
so
well
what
was
the
new
thing
in
it
not
admiration
merely
not
affection
alone
something
almost
fierce
behind
the
tenderness
with
which
she
watched
the
duel
with
the
mob
borrodaile
lifted
a
hand
people
were
far
too
engrossed
he
knew
to
notice
and
he
laid
it
on
vida
which
had
tightened
on
the
back
of
the
bench
dear
he
said
wondering
and
low
as
one
would
to
wake
a
sleepwalker
she
answered
without
looking
at
him
is
it
he
seemed
not
to
know
quite
how
to
frame
his
protest
can
carry
along
at
least
he
grumbled
forget
everybody
else
vida
smiled
it
was
so
plain
whom
he
meant
by
lord
borrodaile
gave
a
faint
laugh
he
probably
knew
that
would
her
round
it
did
it
brought
her
quick
eyes
to
his
face
it
brought
low
words
do
let
her
see
you
laughing
i
mean
can
explain
to
her
afterwards
that
it
was
you
i
was
laughing
at
as
that
failed
of
specific
effect
really
are
a
little
ridiculous
he
said
again
with
the
edge
in
his
voice
on
the
lips
of
that
backfisch
as
if
she
were
demosthenes
do
think
she
a
demosthenes
we
know
she
is
something
much
more
significant
for
ernestine
blunt
clean
out
of
patience
he
turned
his
back
i
alone
she
whispered
over
his
shoulder
as
if
in
apology
at
all
the
other
women
some
of
them
are
very
intelligent
our
interest
in
our
seems
queer
and
unnatural
to
you
because
you
realize
brown
has
always
been
interested
in
mrs
jones
has
she
she
has
said
much
to
brown
about
it
vida
admitted
smiling
because
a
man
interest
in
woman
is
so
limited
borrodaile
laughed
did
know
that
was
his
failing
mean
his
interest
is
of
one
sort
it
confined
to
the
woman
he
finds
interesting
in
way
at
minute
other
women
bore
him
but
other
women
have
always
been
mightily
interesting
to
us
now
sh
listen
can
understand
those
callow
youths
unwarily
he
persisted
pink
and
pert
and
all
the
rest
but
will
you
understand
do
you
know
women
are
more
civilized
than
men
she
be
the
last
animal
domesticated
it
seemed
as
if
he
preferred
to
have
her
angry
rather
than
oblivious
of
him
but
not
for
nothing
did
she
belong
to
a
world
which
dares
to
say
whatever
it
wants
to
say
are
civilized
enough
at
all
events
there
was
an
ominous
sparkle
in
her
eye
listen
to
men
speakers
clever
or
dull
we
listen
quietly
enough
but
men
a
person
must
be
of
your
own
sex
for
you
to
be
able
to
regard
him
without
distraction
if
the
woman
is
beautiful
enough
you
are
intoxicated
if
she
plain
enough
you
are
impatient
all
you
see
in
any
woman
is
her
sex
you
ca
remarked
borrodaile
must
listen
i
have
got
over
being
ashamed
to
find
how
much
this
girl
can
teach
me
sorry
for
you
that
any
of
miss
scammell
interesting
speech
was
lost
the
chairman
was
saying
was
telling
you
just
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
men
ought
to
know
the
kind
of
thing
you
get
little
chance
of
knowing
about
from
men
yet
those
wretched
girls
who
die
young
of
or
live
long
enough
to
bring
sickly
babies
into
the
world
those
poor
working
women
look
to
you
working
men
for
help
are
they
wrong
to
look
to
you
or
are
they
right
you
working
men
represent
the
majority
of
the
electorate
can
change
things
if
you
will
if
you
do
do
think
the
woman
will
suffer
alone
we
shall
all
suffer
together
more
and
more
the
masters
are
saying
we
get
rid
of
these
men
they
too
many
for
us
with
their
unions
and
their
political
pull
we
get
women
we
get
them
for
of
what
we
pay
the
men
good
business
say
the
masters
but
it
bad
business
all
but
the
masters
muttered
the
tramp
for
the
masters
too
said
the
girl
they
ca
see
it
or
else
they
do
care
what
sort
of
world
they
leave
to
their
children
if
you
men
were
so
blind
you
see
the
women
will
be
in
politics
what
they
are
in
the
home
your
best
friends
haw
listen
at
the
women
you
would
be
strong
without
them
you
are
what
you
are
the
ringing
contempt
in
her
tone
was
more
than
one
gentleman
could
put
up
with
do
you
think
the
world
got
on
before
you
came
to
show
it
got
on
very
badly
not
only
in
england
all
over
the
world
men
have
insisted
on
governing
alone
what
the
result
misery
and
degradation
to
the
masses
and
to
the
few
the
rich
and
for
them
corruption
and
decline
it
always
away
at
the
men
pore
devils
people
are
so
foolish
as
to
think
we
are
working
against
the
men
you
are
just
what
the
politicians
would
like
you
to
think
but
it
nonsense
nobody
knows
better
than
we
that
the
best
interests
of
men
and
women
are
identical
they
be
it
trying
to
separate
them
that
made
the
whole
trouble
you
know
it
all
you
see
she
put
on
her
most
friendly
and
reasonable
air
have
never
been
obliged
to
study
women
point
of
view
but
we
been
obliged
to
study
the
men
point
of
view
it
natural
we
should
understand
you
a
great
deal
better
than
you
understand
us
and
though
you
sometimes
disappoint
us
we
do
lose
hope
of
you
awfully
think
that
if
we
can
only
make
you
understand
the
meaning
of
this
agitation
then
you
help
us
to
get
what
we
want
we
believe
the
day
will
come
when
the
old
ideal
of
men
standing
by
the
women
when
that
ideal
will
be
realized
for
do
believe
it
ever
been
realized
it
never
has
now
our
last
speaker
for
will
say
a
few
words
to
you
mrs
thomas
you
had
about
enough
said
borrodaile
impatiently
wait
for
me
was
all
her
answer
you
stay
then
till
the
bitter
end
will
only
be
a
few
moments
now
i
may
as
well
see
it
out
he
glanced
at
his
watch
detached
it
and
held
it
across
the
back
of
the
seat
she
nodded
and
repeated
wait
his
answer
to
that
was
to
turn
not
only
a
bored
but
a
slightly
injured
face
towards
the
woman
who
had
not
without
difficulty
balanced
her
rotund
form
on
the
bench
at
the
far
end
she
might
have
been
the
comfortable
wife
of
a
rural
grocer
she
spoke
the
good
english
you
may
not
infrequently
hear
among
that
class
but
it
became
clear
as
she
went
on
that
she
was
a
person
of
a
wider
cultivation
better
go
she
be
stodgy
and
dull
vida
spoke
with
a
real
sympathy
for
her
friend
sufferings
portentous
dull
no
waist
sighed
borrodaile
but
he
sank
back
in
his
corner
presently
his
wandering
eye
discovered
something
in
his
aspect
that
told
him
subtly
she
was
not
listening
to
the
mauve
matron
neither
were
some
of
the
others
a
number
had
moved
away
and
the
little
lane
their
going
left
was
not
yet
closed
for
the
whole
general
attention
was
obviously
slackened
this
woman
was
interesting
enough
even
to
boo
at
the
people
who
did
go
home
began
to
talk
to
one
another
but
in
vida
face
what
had
brought
to
it
that
still
intensity
borrodaile
moved
so
that
he
could
follow
the
fixed
look
one
of
the
infrequently
passing
hansoms
had
stopped
was
she
looking
at
that
two
laughing
people
leaning
out
straining
to
catch
what
the
mauve
orator
was
saying
suddenly
borrodaile
pulled
his
slack
figure
together
he
ejaculated
softly
stonor
by
the
beard
of
the
prophet
he
half
rose
whether
more
annoyed
or
amazed
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
discovered
he
said
in
a
laughing
whisper
as
he
turned
to
add
murder
out
he
saw
that
vida
had
quietly
averted
her
face
she
was
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand
so
that
it
masked
her
features
even
if
the
woman
who
was
speaking
had
not
been
the
object
of
such
interest
as
the
people
in
the
hansom
had
to
bestow
even
had
either
of
them
looked
towards
vida
corner
only
a
hat
and
a
gauze
ruffle
would
have
been
seen
borrodaile
took
the
hint
his
waning
sense
of
the
humour
of
the
situation
revived
after
all
if
we
lay
low
he
said
smiling
more
broadly
would
be
nuts
for
stonor
to
catch
us
sitting
at
the
feet
of
mrs
thomas
he
positively
chuckled
at
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
he
had
slipped
back
into
his
corner
but
he
could
help
craning
his
neck
to
watch
those
two
leaning
over
the
door
of
the
hansom
while
they
discussed
some
point
with
animation
several
times
the
man
raised
his
hand
as
if
to
give
an
order
through
the
trap
door
each
time
sophia
laughingly
arrested
him
wants
to
go
on
reported
borrodaile
sympathetically
wants
him
to
wait
a
minute
now
he
jumped
out
what
he
looking
for
another
hansom
no
now
out
bless
me
she
shaking
hands
with
him
he
back
in
the
hansom
driving
away
sophia
actually
my
soul
i
do
know
what
come
over
the
women
i
rather
relieved
on
the
whole
he
turned
round
and
spoke
into
vida
ear
been
a
little
sorry
for
sophia
she
never
had
the
smallest
interest
in
any
man
but
that
cousin
of
hers
and
of
course
it
quite
hopeless
vida
sat
perfectly
motionless
back
to
the
speaker
back
to
the
disappearing
hansom
staring
at
the
parapet
can
turn
round
now
quite
safe
sophia
out
of
range
poor
sophia
after
a
little
pause
course
you
know
stonor
of
course
well
my
distinguished
cousin
used
not
to
be
so
hard
to
get
hold
of
not
in
the
old
days
when
we
were
seeing
so
much
of
your
father
must
have
been
when
i
was
in
the
schoolroom
was
it
he
turned
suddenly
and
looked
at
her
forgotten
you
know
geoffrey
and
you
do
like
him
i
saw
that
once
before
before
she
echoed
he
reminded
her
of
the
time
she
hurried
away
from
ulland
house
to
bishopsmead
was
deceived
he
said
with
his
look
of
smiling
malice
did
care
two
pins
about
your
cousin
mary
and
her
influenza
vida
moved
her
expressionless
face
a
little
to
the
right
can
see
sophia
but
she
listening
to
the
speech
and
vida
herself
with
something
of
an
effort
seemed
now
to
be
following
the
sordid
experiences
of
a
girl
that
the
speaker
had
befriended
some
years
before
it
was
through
this
girl
the
mauve
matron
said
that
she
herself
had
come
into
touch
with
the
abject
poor
she
took
a
big
barrack
of
a
house
in
a
neighbourhood
and
it
became
known
that
there
she
received
and
helped
both
men
and
women
sympathized
with
the
men
but
it
was
the
things
the
women
told
me
that
appalled
me
they
were
too
bad
to
be
entirely
believed
but
i
wrote
them
down
they
haunted
me
i
investigated
i
found
i
had
no
excuse
for
doubting
those
stories
woman
a
find
vida
whispered
to
the
chairman
ernestine
shook
her
head
she
making
a
speech
said
vida
astonished
nobody
here
who
will
care
about
it
do
you
say
that
all
she
saying
is
a
commonplace
to
these
people
was
new
to
something
they
could
take
hold
of
i
stick
to
it
you
got
a
good
ally
in
this
woman
let
her
stand
up
in
somerset
hall
and
tell
the
people
would
do
said
the
young
daniel
firmly
do
believe
her
story
i
do
say
the
things
are
true
but
she
moved
uneasily
subject
too
prickly
prickly
for
you
the
girl
nodded
with
an
anxious
eye
on
the
speaker
sometimes
make
a
passing
reference
just
to
set
men
thinking
and
there
leave
it
but
it
always
makes
them
furious
of
course
it
does
no
good
either
people
know
and
just
accept
it
or
else
they
wo
believe
and
it
only
gets
them
on
the
raw
i
have
to
stop
her
if
she
leaned
forward
odd
your
taking
it
like
this
i
suppose
it
because
you
so
young
said
vida
wondering
must
be
because
for
you
it
real
it
because
i
see
no
decent
woman
can
think
much
about
it
and
keep
sane
that
why
i
say
this
one
wo
be
any
good
to
us
she
never
be
able
to
see
anything
clearly
but
that
one
thing
she
always
be
forgetting
the
main
issue
do
you
call
the
main
issue
political
power
of
course
wise
young
daniel
she
murmured
as
miss
blunt
touched
the
speaker
sleeve
and
interjected
a
word
into
the
middle
of
a
piece
of
depressing
narrative
thomas
stopped
faltered
and
pulled
herself
up
with
as
i
say
with
my
own
verifications
these
experiences
form
a
body
of
testimony
that
should
stir
the
conscience
of
the
community
i
felt
she
glanced
at
ernestine
felt
it
was
too
ghastly
to
publish
but
it
ought
to
be
used
those
who
doubted
the
evidence
should
examine
it
i
went
to
a
lady
who
is
well
known
to
be
concerned
about
public
questions
her
husband
is
a
member
of
parliament
and
a
person
of
influence
you
do
know
perhaps
but
she
did
that
there
a
parliamentary
commission
going
to
sit
here
in
london
in
a
few
weeks
for
the
purpose
of
inquiring
into
certain
police
regulations
which
greatly
concern
women
who
do
you
think
are
invited
to
serve
on
that
commission
men
all
men
not
a
woman
in
england
is
being
consulted
the
husband
of
the
lady
i
went
to
see
he
was
one
of
the
commissioners
i
said
to
her
ought
to
be
serving
on
that
board
she
said
oh
no
but
that
women
like
her
could
influence
the
men
who
sat
on
the
commission
is
better
whispered
the
ernestine
with
a
smile
i
told
her
about
my
ten
years
work
i
showed
her
some
of
my
records
not
the
worst
the
average
sifted
and
verified
she
could
hardly
be
persuaded
to
glance
at
what
i
had
been
at
so
much
pains
to
collect
you
see
she
spoke
as
though
in
apology
for
the
lady
see
i
had
no
official
or
recognized
position
hear
said
ernestine
was
simply
a
woman
whose
standing
in
the
community
was
all
right
but
i
had
nothing
to
recommend
me
to
serious
attention
i
had
nothing
but
the
courage
to
look
wrong
in
the
face
and
the
conscience
to
report
it
honestly
when
i
told
her
certain
things
things
that
are
so
stinging
a
disgrace
that
no
decent
person
can
hear
them
unmoved
when
i
told
her
of
the
degrading
discomforts
the
cruelties
that
are
practised
against
homeless
women
even
in
some
of
the
casual
wards
and
the
mixed
that
lady
said
sitting
there
in
her
pleasant
she
said
it
could
not
be
true
my
reports
were
exaggerated
women
were
sentimental
the
authorities
managed
these
places
with
great
wisdom
they
are
so
horrible
i
said
they
drive
women
to
the
streets
she
assured
me
i
was
mistaken
i
asked
her
if
she
had
ever
been
inside
a
mixed
she
never
had
but
the
casual
wards
she
knew
about
they
were
so
well
managed
she
herself
mind
at
all
spending
a
night
in
one
of
these
municipal
provisions
for
the
homeless
then
i
said
you
are
the
woman
i
am
looking
for
come
with
me
one
night
and
try
it
what
night
shall
it
be
she
said
she
was
engaged
in
writing
a
book
she
could
not
interrupt
her
work
but
i
said
if
those
places
are
so
comfortable
it
wo
interfere
with
your
work
she
the
she
talked
about
the
commission
the
commission
was
going
to
make
a
thorough
scientific
investigation
nothing
amateur
about
the
commission
the
lady
was
sincere
thomas
vouched
for
it
had
a
comfortable
faith
in
the
commission
but
i
say
the
woman
leaned
forward
in
her
earnestness
say
that
commission
will
waste
its
time
i
do
deny
it
will
investigate
and
discuss
the
position
of
the
outcast
women
of
this
country
their
plight
which
is
the
work
of
men
will
once
more
be
inquired
into
by
men
i
say
there
should
be
women
on
that
commission
if
the
middle
and
upper
class
women
have
the
dignity
and
influence
men
pretend
they
have
why
are
they
represented
there
nobody
pretends
the
matter
does
concern
the
mothers
of
the
nation
it
concerns
them
horribly
nobody
can
think
so
ill
of
them
as
to
suppose
they
do
care
it
monstrous
that
men
should
sit
upon
that
committee
alone
women
have
had
to
think
about
these
things
we
believe
this
evil
can
be
met
if
men
will
let
us
try
it
may
be
that
only
women
comprehend
it
since
men
through
the
ages
have
been
helpless
before
it
why
then
once
again
this
commission
of
the
mockery
of
it
setting
men
to
make
their
report
upon
this
matter
to
men
i
am
not
a
public
speaker
but
i
am
a
wife
and
a
mother
do
you
wonder
that
hearing
about
that
commission
gave
me
courage
to
take
the
first
opportunity
to
join
these
brave
sisters
of
mine
who
are
fighting
for
political
liberty
she
seemed
for
the
first
time
to
notice
that
a
little
group
of
sniggerers
were
becoming
more
obstreperous
knew
of
course
that
whatever
we
say
some
of
you
will
laugh
and
jeer
but
speaking
for
myself
no
mockery
that
you
are
able
to
fling
at
us
can
sting
like
the
thought
of
the
hypocrisy
of
that
commission
do
you
wonder
that
when
we
think
of
it
you
men
who
have
power
and
use
it
do
you
wonder
that
women
come
out
of
their
homes
young
and
old
and
that
we
stand
up
here
in
the
public
places
and
give
you
scorn
for
scorn
as
the
unheroic
figure
trembling
stepped
off
the
bench
she
found
vida
levering
hand
held
out
to
steady
her
my
seat
said
the
younger
woman
she
stood
beside
her
for
once
oblivious
of
ernestine
who
was
calling
for
new
members
and
giving
out
notices
vida
bent
over
the
shapeless
mauve
bundle
asked
that
woman
to
go
with
you
i
wish
you
take
me
my
dear
do
need
to
go
again
i
thought
to
have
that
lady
see
it
would
do
good
her
husband
has
influence
you
see
you
just
said
the
men
are
useless
in
this
matter
she
had
no
answer
i
believe
vida
went
on
more
women
were
like
you
if
they
looked
into
the
thing
few
could
stand
it
do
hundreds
of
poor
women
stand
much
worse
they
drink
and
they
die
i
was
ill
for
three
months
after
my
first
experience
even
of
the
tramp
ward
that
the
first
thing
you
tried
the
first
thing
i
tried
was
putting
on
a
salvation
army
bonnet
and
following
the
people
i
wanted
to
help
into
the
selling
the
one
wear
the
uniform
who
is
a
member
of
the
army
is
usual
she
said
slowly
and
then
as
though
to
give
the
de
to
the
fine
lady
curiosity
that
was
child
play
before
i
sampled
the
tramp
ward
i
covered
myself
with
keating
powder
from
head
to
foot
it
was
a
bit
of
good
may
i
come
and
talk
to
you
mrs
thomas
vida
turned
and
found
the
lady
sophia
at
her
side
father
oh
i
see
miss
levering
well
she
turned
to
the
woman
in
the
corner
the
house
of
help
you
know
about
thomas
work
vida
asked
rather
i
collect
rents
in
her
district
do
you
you
never
told
me
should
i
tell
you
ernestine
was
dismissing
the
meeting
are
very
tired
said
lord
borrodaile
looking
at
vida
face
she
said
go
now
come
sophia
shall
be
here
on
thursday
ernestine
was
saying
the
same
hour
and
we
hope
a
great
many
of
you
will
want
to
join
us
a
trip
to
no
thank
you
upon
that
something
indistinguishable
to
the
three
who
were
withdrawing
was
said
in
the
group
that
had
sniggered
through
thomas
speech
another
one
of
that
choice
circle
gave
a
great
guffaw
there
were
still
more
who
were
amused
but
less
indiscreetly
three
men
looking
like
gentlemen
paused
in
the
act
of
strolling
by
they
too
were
smiling
laugh
ernestine
voice
rang
out
a
moment
said
vida
to
her
companions
she
looked
back
it
was
plain
from
ernestine
face
she
was
not
going
to
let
the
meeting
break
up
on
that
note
you
think
it
a
little
strange
considering
the
chivalry
among
men
do
you
think
it
strange
that
against
no
reform
the
world
has
ever
seen
wot
rot
you
do
admit
it
reform
call
it
revolt
she
threw
the
word
out
among
the
people
as
if
its
fire
scorched
her
no
revolt
has
there
ever
been
such
a
torrent
of
ridicule
let
loose
as
against
the
women
movement
it
almost
seems
as
if
in
spite
of
protecting
tenderness
towards
woman
it
almost
seems
as
if
there
nothing
in
this
world
so
funny
to
a
man
as
a
woman
haw
got
it
right
that
time
borrodaile
was
smiling
too
you
know
vida
asked
those
men
are
who
have
just
stopped
believe
ernestine
does
perhaps
they
bold
bad
members
of
parliament
of
us
she
was
saying
read
a
little
history
we
have
read
how
every
struggle
towards
freedom
has
met
with
opposition
and
abuse
we
expected
to
have
our
share
of
those
things
but
we
find
that
no
movement
before
ours
has
ever
had
so
much
laughter
to
face
through
the
renewed
merriment
she
went
on
you
wonder
i
admit
that
we
do
deny
anything
that
true
and
i
tell
you
another
thing
we
are
made
any
prouder
of
our
by
the
discovery
that
behind
their
old
theory
of
woman
as
half
angel
half
idiot
is
a
sneaking
feeling
that
woman
is
a
huge
joke
just
a
little
one
for
a
penny
like
you
have
imagined
they
imagine
still
that
we
have
never
noticed
how
ridiculous
can
be
you
see
she
leaned
over
and
spoke
confidentially
never
dared
break
it
to
them
haw
know
they
bear
we
done
all
our
laughing
in
our
sleeves
yes
and
some
years
our
sleeves
had
to
be
made
like
balloons
she
pulled
out
the
loose
alpaca
of
her
own
while
the
workmen
chuckled
with
appreciation
bet
on
ernestine
said
a
young
man
with
an
air
of
admitting
himself
a
bold
original
fellow
open
laughter
is
less
dangerous
laughter
it
even
a
guide
it
helps
us
to
find
out
things
some
of
us
would
know
otherwise
lots
of
women
used
to
be
taken
in
by
that
talk
about
feminine
influence
and
about
men
immense
respect
for
them
but
any
number
of
women
have
come
to
see
that
underneath
that
old
mask
of
chivalry
was
a
broad
we
are
reminded
of
that
every
time
the
house
of
commons
talks
about
us
she
flung
it
at
the
three
supercilious
strangers
dullest
gentleman
there
can
raise
a
laugh
if
he
speaks
of
the
fair
sex
such
jokes
even
when
they
are
clean
such
poor
little
feeble
efforts
that
even
a
member
of
parliament
could
laugh
at
them
unless
he
had
grown
up
with
the
idea
that
woman
was
somehow
essentially
funny
and
that
oh
no
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
laugh
at
in
man
those
members
of
parliament
do
have
the
enlightenment
that
you
men
have
of
hearing
what
women
think
when
we
hear
men
laugh
as
you
did
just
now
about
our
going
to
prison
they
do
know
that
we
find
it
just
a
little
strange
she
bent
over
the
scattering
rabble
and
gathered
it
into
a
sudden
fellowship
it
strike
you
too
as
strange
that
when
a
strong
man
goes
to
prison
for
his
convictions
it
is
thought
to
be
something
rather
fine
i
do
say
it
is
myself
though
it
the
general
impression
but
when
a
weak
woman
goes
for
convictions
men
find
it
very
humorous
indeed
our
prisoners
have
to
bear
not
only
the
hardships
of
holloway
gaol
but
they
have
to
bear
the
worse
pains
and
penalties
inflicted
by
the
general
public
you
too
you
laugh
and
yet
i
say
she
lifted
her
arms
and
spread
them
out
above
the
people
say
it
was
not
until
women
were
found
ready
to
go
to
prison
not
till
then
was
the
success
of
the
cause
assured
her
bright
eyes
were
shining
brighter
still
with
tears
prison
so
good
fur
the
cause
why
did
go
a
gentleman
who
asks
why
i
did
go
to
prison
the
answer
to
that
is
i
did
go
she
tossed
the
information
down
among
the
cheers
and
groans
as
lightly
as
though
it
had
no
more
personal
significance
for
her
than
a
dropped
leaflet
setting
forth
some
minor
fact
delicate
little
girl
breathed
vida
never
told
that
item
in
her
history
said
borrodaile
never
told
me
never
once
spoke
of
it
they
put
her
in
prison
it
was
as
if
she
could
grasp
it
course
one
person
going
is
of
much
consequence
ernestine
was
winding
up
with
equal
spirit
and
the
fact
that
dozens
and
scores
all
sorts
and
conditions
are
ready
to
go
matters
and
that
the
place
our
reprehensible
tactics
have
brought
the
movement
to
the
meeting
is
closed
they
dropped
sophia
at
her
own
door
but
lord
borrodaile
said
he
would
take
vida
home
they
drove
along
in
silence
when
they
stopped
before
the
tall
house
in
queen
anne
gate
vida
held
out
her
hand
late
i
wo
ask
you
in
are
go
to
bed
wish
i
could
i
dining
out
he
looked
at
her
out
of
kind
eyes
begins
to
be
dreadfully
stuffy
in
town
i
glad
after
all
we
going
on
that
absurd
yachting
trip
not
going
she
said
nonsense
sophia
and
i
would
break
our
hearts
sure
about
sophia
will
do
you
good
to
come
and
have
a
look
at
the
land
of
the
midnight
sun
he
said
going
to
have
a
look
at
the
land
of
midnight
where
there
no
sun
and
everybody
but
you
and
sophia
and
my
sister
will
think
i
in
norway
when
she
explained
he
broke
out
the
very
wildest
nonsense
that
ever
it
would
kill
you
the
intensity
of
his
opposition
made
him
incoherent
of
all
women
in
the
world
a
creature

turned
and
looked
at
her
with
an
earnestness
she
had
never
seen
in
his
eyes
before
in
heaven
should
you
heard
what
that
woman
said

to
account
for
partly
she
interrupted
i
must
make
this
experiment
when
a
man
like
you
as
good
a
man
as
you
she
repeated
with
slow
wonder
you
and
all
the
other
good
men
that
the
world
is
full
of
when
you
all
know
everything
that
that
woman
knows

more
and
yet
see
nothing
in

on
this

road

you
i
shall
have
to
thank
he
shrugged
drearily
at
the
absurd
charge
making
no
motion
to
take
the
offered
hand
but
sat
there
in
the
corner
of
the
hansom
looking
rather
old
and
shrunken

without

had
set
up
in
my
heart
an
image
that
still
serves
with
me
as
a
symbol
for
things
inconceivable
to
a

who

chapter
xiv
the
fall
of
the
liberal
ministry
was
said
by
the
to
have
come
as
a
bolt
from
the
blue
certainly
into
the
subsequent
general
election
were
entering
elements
but
little
foreseen
nevertheless
the
last
two
before
the
crash
had
resulted
in
the
defeat
of
the
liberal
candidate
not
by
the
tory
antagonist
but
in
one
case
by
the
nominee
of
the
labour
party
in
the
other
by
an
independent
socialist
both
these
men
had
publicly
thanked
the
suffragettes
for
their
notable
share
in
piling
up
those
triumphant
and
highly
significant
majorities
now
the
country
was
facing
an
election
where
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
any
great
nation
women
were
playing
a
part
that
even
their
political
enemies
could
hardly
with
easy
minds
call
subordinate
only
faint
echoes
of
the
din
penetrated
the
spacious
quiet
of
ulland
house
although
the
frequent
party
was
there
the
great
hall
on
this
particular
morning
presented
a
deserted
appearance
as
the
tall
clock
by
the
staircase
chimed
the
hour
of
noon
the
insistence
of
the
ancient
timepiece
seemed
to
have
set
up
a
rival
in
destruction
of
the
sunday
peace
for
no
sooner
had
the
twelfth
stroke
died
than
a
bell
began
to
ring
the
little
door
in
the
wainscot
beyond
the
clock
was
opened
an
elderly
butler
put
his
head
round
the
huge
screen
of
spanish
leather
that
masked
the
very
existence
of
the
modest
means
of
communication
with
the
quarters
of
the
ulland
domestics
so
little
was
a
ring
at
the
front
door
expected
at
this
hour
that
sutton
was
still
slowly
getting
into
the
left
sleeve
of
his
coat
when
his
mistress
appeared
from
the
garden
by
way
of
the
french
window
the
old
butler
withdrew
a
discreet
instant
behind
the
screen
to
put
the
last
touches
to
his
toilet
but
lady
john
had
seen
that
he
was
there
miss
levering
gone
for
a
walk
she
inquired
of
the
servant
do
know
not
in
the
garden
do
you
think
she
not
down
yet
have
seen
her
said
sutton
emerging
from
his
retirement
and
approaching
the
wide
staircase
on
his
way
to
answer
the
bell
mind
his
mistress
went
briskly
over
to
a
and
seated
herself
before
a
litter
of
papers
have
her
disturbed
if
she
resting
lady
john
said
adding
half
to
herself
certainly
needs
it
said
sutton
adjusting
the
maroon
collar
of
his
livery
which
had
insisted
upon
riding
up
at
the
back
i
want
her
to
know
lady
john
spoke
while
glancing
through
a
letter
before
consigning
it
to
the
wastepaper
basket
moment
she
comes
down
she
must
be
told
that
the
new
plans
arrived
by
the
morning
post
understand
there
they
are
the
lady
held
up
a
packet
about
which
she
had
just
snapped
an
elastic
band
put
them
here
very
important
she
should
have
them
in
time
to
look
over
before
she
goes
sutton
opened
a
door
and
disappeared
a
footstep
sounded
on
the
marble
floor
of
the
lobby
over
her
shoulder
lady
john
called
out
miss
levering
mr
farnborough
afraid
i
scandalously
early
in
spite
of
his
words
the
young
man
whipped
off
his
dust
coat
and
flung
it
to
the
servant
with
as
much
precipitation
as
though
what
he
had
meant
to
say
was
late
motored
up
from
dutfield
it
did
take
me
nearly
so
long
as
lord
john
said
the
lady
had
given
the
young
man
her
hand
without
rising
afraid
my
husband
is
no
authority
on
motoring
and
he
not
home
yet
from
church
the
greatest
luck
finding
farnborough
sat
himself
down
in
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
wide
undaunted
by
its
air
or
the
preoccupied
look
of
the
woman
before
it
thought
miss
levering
was
the
only
person
under
this
roof
who
was
ever
allowed
to
observe
sunday
as
a
real
day
of
rest
you
come
to
see
miss
levering
began
lady
john
she
here
i
give
you
my
word
i
did
know
it
said
the
lady
unconvinced
thought
she
given
up
coming
she
begun
again
she
helping
me
about
something
helping
you
is
she
said
farnborough
with
absent
eyes
and
then
suddenly
there
john
i
come
to
ask
you
to
help
miss
levering
said
hermione
heriot
aunt
ca
do
it
no
all
that
no
good
she
only
laughs
breathed
the
lady
relieved
looks
upon
you
as
a
boy
nonsense
he
burst
out
suddenly
do
you
think
she
said
to
me
the
day
before
she
went
off
yachting
she
was
four
years
older
than
you
i
knew
that
no
she
said
knew
she
was
all
the
charming
things
i
been
saying
but
there
was
only
one
way
to
prove
it
and
that
was
to
marry
some
one
young
enough
to
be
her
son
she
noticed
she
said
that
was
what
the
attractive
women
did
and
she
named
names
lady
john
laughed
were
too
old
he
nodded
future
husband
she
said
was
probably
just
entering
eton
like
her
no
dick
farnborough
waived
the
subject
away
wanted
to
see
you
about
the
secretaryship
did
get
it
then
it
the
grief
of
my
life
if
you
do
get
one
you
get
another
there
only
one
he
said
desperately
one
vacancy
one
man
i
give
my
ears
to
work
for
lady
john
smiled
remember
he
turned
his
sanguine
head
with
a
quick
look
i
talk
about
stonor
well
it
a
habit
people
have
got
into
forget
do
you
know
stonor
personally
or
she
smiled
her
tolerant
smile
are
you
just
dazzled
from
afar
i
know
him
the
trouble
is
he
does
know
me
if
he
did
realize
he
ca
be
sure
of
winning
his
election
without
my
valuable
services
stonor
is
always
a
foregone
conclusion
farnborough
banged
his
hand
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
the
great
man
shares
that
opinion
is
precisely
his
weak
point
then
breaking
into
a
pleasant
smile
as
he
made
a
clean
breast
of
his
weak
point
you
think
inquired
lady
john
lightly
because
the
liberals
swept
the
country
the
last
time
there
danger
of
their
can
we
be
sure
conservative
seat
is
safe
after
as
lady
john
smiled
and
turned
to
her
papers
again
me
said
the
young
man
with
a
tolerant
air
know
you
not
interested
in
politics
politics
but
this
concerns
geoffrey
stonor
you
count
on
my
being
interested
in
him
like
all
the
rest
he
leaned
forward
john
i
heard
the
news
news
your
little
niece
the
scotch
heiress
is
going
to
marry
him
told
you
that
she
dropped
the
paper
she
had
picked
up
and
stared
no
doubt
about
his
having
won
her
whole
attention
at
last
do
mind
my
knowing
but
lady
john
was
visibly
perturbed
had
set
her
heart
on
having
a
few
days
with
just
her
family
in
the
secret
before
the
flood
of
congratulation
broke
loose
all
right
he
said
soothingly
always
hear
things
before
other
people
i
must
ask
you
to
be
good
enough
to
be
very
circumspect
lady
john
spoke
gravely
would
have
my
niece
or
stonor
think
that
any
of
us
of
course
not
suspect
something
if
you
so
much
as
mention
stonor
and
you
ca
help
mentioning
stonor
i
can
besides
i
sha
see
her
you
will
lady
john
glanced
at
the
clock
be
here
in
an
hour
he
jumped
up
delighted
the
future
mrs
stonor
said
his
hostess
with
a
harassed
air
we
had
one
or
two
people
already
asked
for
the
week
and
i
go
and
invite
myself
to
luncheon
lady
john
he
pushed
back
the
armchair
like
one
who
clears
the
field
for
action
he
stood
before
her
with
his
legs
wide
apart
and
a
look
of
enterprise
on
his
face
can
buy
me
off
i
promise
to
remove
myself
in
five
minutes
if
you
put
in
a
word
for
me
lady
john
shook
her
head
stonor
inspires
a
similar
enthusiasm
in
so
many
young
have
studied
the
situation
as
i
have
he
sat
down
to
explain
his
own
excellence
do
know
what
at
stake
they
do
go
to
that
hole
dutfield
as
i
did
just
to
hear
his
friday
speech
you
were
rewarded
my
niece
jean
wrote
me
it
was
glorious
you
know
i
was
disappointed
he
said
judicially
too
content
just
to
criticize
just
to
make
his
delicate
pungent
fun
of
the
men
who
are
grappling
very
inadequately
of
course
still
with
the
big
questions
there
a
carrying
power
he
jumped
to
his
feet
again
and
faced
an
imaginary
audience
of
stonor
friends
ought
to
point
it
out
there
a
driving
power
in
the
poorest
constructive
policy
that
makes
the
most
brilliant
criticism
look
barren
she
regarded
the
budding
politician
with
malice
told
you
that
think
there
nothing
in
it
because
say
it
but
now
that
coming
into
the
family
lord
john
or
somebody
really
ought
to
point
out
stonor
overdoing
his
rÃ´le
of
magnificent
security
the
lady
sat
very
straight
do
see
even
lord
john
offering
to
instruct
stonor
she
said
with
dignity
me
that
just
stonor
danger
nobody
saying
a
word
everybody
hoping
he
on
the
point
of
adopting
some
definite
line
something
strong
and
original
that
going
to
fire
the
public
imagination
and
bring
the
tories
back
into
power
he
will
if
he
disappoints
meetings
said
farnborough
hotly
if
he
goes
calmly
up
to
town
and
leaves
the
field
to
the
liberals
did
he
do
anything
like
that
farnborough
flung
out
the
accusation
as
he
strode
up
and
down
before
the
divan
now
he
got
this
other
preoccupation
mean
your
niece
the
spoilt
child
of
fortune
farnborough
stopped
suddenly
and
smacked
his
forehead
he
wheeled
round
upon
lady
john
with
accusing
face
understand
it
now
kept
him
from
the
meeting
last
night
he
collapsed
in
the
nearest
chair
that
the
effect
she
going
to
have
it
pretty
serious
are
said
his
hostess
can
assure
you
the
election
agent
more
so
he
simply
tearing
his
hair
she
had
risen
do
you
know
she
asked
more
gravely
told
me
so
himself
yesterday
i
scraped
acquaintance
with
the
agent
just
to
see
if
if
see
she
smiled
not
only
here
that
you
manoeuvre
for
that
secretaryship
as
lady
john
moved
towards
the
staircase
she
looked
at
the
clock
farnborough
jumped
up
and
followed
her
saying
confidentially
see
you
can
never
tell
when
your
chance
might
come
the
election
chap
promised
to
keep
me
posted
why
i
even
taken
the
trouble
to
arrange
with
the
people
at
the
station
to
receive
any
message
that
might
come
over
from
dutfield
you
she
smiled
at
his
breathlessly
he
hurried
on
unexpected
pressure
of
work
you
know
now
that
we
forced
the
liberals
to
appeal
to
the
country
he
stopped
as
the
sound
of
light
steps
came
flying
through
the
lobby
and
a
young
girl
rushed
into
the
hall
calling
out
gaily
ellen
here
i
she
stopped
precipitately
and
her
outstretched
arms
fell
to
her
sides
a
radiant
gracious
figure
she
stood
poised
an
instant
the
light
of
gladness
in
her
eyes
only
partially
dimmed
by
the
horrid
spectacle
of
an
interloper
in
the
person
of
a
strange
young
man
darling
jean
lady
john
went
forward
and
kissed
her
at
the
moment
that
the
master
of
the
house
came
hurrying
in
from
the
garden
with
a
cheerful
that
was
you
running
up
the
avenue
dear
the
pretty
vision
greeted
him
with
the
air
of
a
privileged
child
of
the
house
interrupting
only
for
an
instant
the
babel
of
explanation
about
carriages
and
trains
lord
john
had
shaken
hands
with
dick
farnborough
and
walked
him
towards
the
window
saying
through
the
torrent
they
tell
each
other
for
the
next
ten
minutes
that
she
an
hour
earlier
than
we
expected
although
young
farnborough
had
looked
upon
the
blooming
addition
to
the
party
with
an
undisguised
interest
he
readily
fell
in
with
lord
diplomatic
move
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
he
even
helped
towards
his
own
effacement
looking
out
through
the
window
with
freddy
tunbridges
said
they
were
coming
to
you
this
week
they
dawdling
through
the
park
with
the
church
brigade
i
go
and
meet
them
and
farnborough
disappeared
as
lord
john
turned
back
to
his
two
ladies
he
offered
it
as
his
opinion
discreet
young
man
will
get
on
did
you
get
here
lady
john
was
still
wondering
breathless
the
girl
answered
motored
me
down
stonor
she
nodded
beaming
where
is
he
then
dropped
me
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
and
went
on
to
see
a
supporter
about
something
let
him
go
off
like
that
lord
john
reproached
her
ever
lady
john
interrupted
herself
to
take
jean
two
hands
in
hers
tell
me
my
child
is
it
all
right
engagement
absolutely
such
radiant
security
shone
in
the
soft
face
that
the
older
woman
drawing
the
girl
down
beside
her
on
the
divan
dared
to
say
stonor
is
going
to
be
a
little
too
old
for
you
jean
chimed
out
the
gayest
laugh
in
the
world
me
am
i
such
a
chicken
used
not
to
be
so
young
but
it
become
so
we
do
grow
up
so
quick
she
agreed
merrily
on
the
other
hand
we
up
longer
got
what
vulgarly
called
looks
my
dear
said
her
uncle
that
will
help
to
you
up
know
what
uncle
john
thinking
she
turned
on
him
with
a
pretty
air
of
challenge
i
not
the
only
girl
who
been
left
vulgarly
called
money
the
only
one
of
our
immediate
circle
who
been
left
so
beautifully
much
but
remember
geoffrey
could
everybody
he
could
have
married
any
one
in
england
am
afraid
everybody
does
know
it
said
her
ladyship
faintly
ironic
excepting
mr
stonor
how
spoilt
is
the
great
man
inquired
lord
john
mischievously
the
least
little
bit
in
the
world
you
see
he
so
wants
to
know
my
relations
better
she
stopped
to
bestow
another
embrace
on
lady
john
orphan
has
so
few
belongings
she
has
to
make
the
most
of
them
us
hope
he
approve
of
us
on
further
acquaintance
he
will
he
an
angel
why
he
gets
on
with
my
grandfather
he
said
her
aunt
unable
to
forbear
teasing
her
a
little
mean
to
say
geoffrey
stonor
is
just
a
tiny
bit
superior
about
dissenters
half
as
much
so
as
uncle
john
and
all
the
rest
of
you
my
grandfather
been
ill
again
you
know
and
rather
difficult
bless
him
but
geoffrey
she
clasped
her
hands
to
fill
out
her
wordless
content
with
him
have
powers
of
persuasion
to
get
that
old
covenanter
to
let
you
come
in
an
abhorred
on
sunday
too
jean
pursed
her
red
lips
and
put
up
a
cautionary
finger
with
a
droll
little
air
of
alarm
did
know
she
half
whispered
know
honestly
meant
to
come
by
train
she
hastened
to
exculpate
herself
met
me
on
my
way
to
the
station
we
had
the
most
glorious
run
oh
aunt
ellen
we
so
happy
she
pressed
her
cheek
against
lady
john
shoulder
so
looked
forward
to
having
you
to
myself
the
whole
day
just
to
talk
to
you
about
lord
john
turned
away
with
affected
displeasure
very
well
she
jumped
up
and
caught
him
affectionately
by
the
arm
find
it
dreffly
dull
to
hear
me
talk
about
geoffrey
the
whole
blessed
day
till
luncheon
my
dear
lady
john
had
risen
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
must
mind
if
i
she
broke
off
and
went
to
the
saying
aside
to
her
husband
beginning
to
feel
a
little
anxious
miss

only
tired
last
night
she
was

looked
very
white
said
lord

the
happy
egoist
or

your
uncle
responsible
for
asking

old
cynic

stopped
in
the
act
of
taking
off
her
long
gloves
greatorex
he
a
liberal
is
he
she
said
with
sudden
gravity
jean
lord
john
chuckled
to
think
in
parties
very
natural
now
that
she
should
only
meant
it
was
odd
he
should
be
of
course
i
not
so
silly
all
right
my
child
said
her
uncle
kindly
naturally

now
that

begin
to
think
like
geoffrey
stonor
and
to
feel
like
geoffrey
stonor
and
to
talk
like
geoffrey
stonor
and
quite
proper
too
jean
quickly
recovered
her
smiles
i
think
with
my
husband
and
feel
with
him
as
of
course
i
shall
it
will
surprise
me
if
i
ever

myself
talking
a
tenth
as
well
in

enthusiasm
she
followed

she
stopped
short
freddy

she
exclaimed
looking
out
into
the
garden
a
moment
later
her
gay
look
fell
not
aunt
lydia
she
glanced
back
reproachfully
at
lady
john
to
find
her
making
a
discreet
motion
of
could
help
it
as
the
party
from
the
garden
came
in
the
greetings
of
the
freddys
were
cut
short
by
heriot
who
embraced
her

with
a
significant
warmth

surprised
she
said

said
the
young
man
who
had
been
watching
his
opportunity
dick
farnborough
i
remember
jean
gave
him
her
hand
freddy
was
looking
round
and
asking
where
was
the
elusive
one
is
the
elusive
one
jean
demanded
john
new
ally
in
good
works
said
freddy
you
met
her
one
day
at
my
house
before
you
went
back
to
scotland
you
mean
miss
levering
nice
creature
is
she
said
lord
john
benevolently
used
rather
to
love
her
said
freddy
brightly
she
does
come
to
us
any
more
she
seems
to
be
giving
up
going
anywhere
except
here
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
knows
she
can
rest
here
said
lady
john
does
she
do
to
tire
her
demanded
freddy
she
been
amusing
herself
in
norway
she
came
back
she
been
helping
my
sister
and
me
with
a
scheme
of
ours
said
lady
john
certainly
knows
how
to
juggle
money
out
of
the
men
admitted
heriot
would
sound
less
equivocal
lydia
if
you
added
that
the
money
is
to
build
baths
in
our
shelter
for
homeless
women
women
echoed
freddy
in
the
most
insanitary
part
of
soho
a
really

his
smart
little
moustache

sound
quite
in

farnborough
hazarded
dear

said
his
hostess
know
as
little
about
what
in
a
woman
line
as
most
men
i
say
freddy
looked
round
with
a
laugh
lord
john
threw
out
his
chest
and
dangled
his
eyeglass
with
an
indulgent
air
he
said
a
woman
like
miss
levering
is
a
form
of
restlessness
but
she
a
creature
all
she
needs
is
to
get
some
nice
fella
to
marry
her
freddy
laughingly
hooked
herself
on
her
husband
arm
a
woman
needs
a
balance
wheel
if
only
to
keep
her
from
flying
back
to
town
on
a
hot
day
like
this
demanded
the
host
proposing
anything
so
elusive
one
said
freddy
miss
before
luncheon
dick
farnborough
glanced
quickly
at
the
clock
and
then
his
eyes
went
questing
up
the
great
staircase
lady
john
had
met
the
chorus
of
disapproval
with
must
be
in
london
by
three
she
says
lord
john
stared
why
she
only
came
late
last
night
what
must
she
go
back
for
in
the
name
of
i
did
ask
her
but
it
must
be
something
important
or
she
would
stay
and
talk
over
the
plans
for
the
new
shelter
farnborough
had
pulled
out
his
cigarette
case
and
stepped
out
through
the
window
into
the
garden
but
he
went
not
as
one
who
means
to
take
a
stroll
and
enjoy
a
smoke
rather
as
a
man
on
a
mission
a
few
minutes
after
the
desultory
conversation
in
the
hall
was
arrested
by
the
sound
of
voices
near
the
windows
they
were
in
full
view
now
vida
levering
hatless
a
cool
figure
in
with
a
red
umbrella
john
greatorex
wearing
a
panama
hat
talking
and
gesticulating
with
a
small
book
in
which
his
fingers
still
kept
the
place
farnborough
a
little
supercilious
looking
on
protest
good
lord
what
are
the
women
of
this
country
coming
to
i
against
miss
levering
being
carried
indoors
to
discuss
anything
so
revolting
as
lord
john
moved
towards
the
window
the
vermilion
disk
of
the
umbrella
closed
and
dropped
like
a
poppy
before
it
blooms
as
the
owner
of
it
entered
the
hall
greatorex
followed
in
her
wake
calling
out
my
soul
what
can
a
woman
like
you
about
such
a
thing
enough
said
miss
levering
smiling
and
scattering
should
think
so
indeed
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
and
recovered
his
waggishness
all
this
fellow
farnborough
wicked
jealousy
routing
us
out
of
the
where
we
were
sitting
happy
were
we
said
the
lady
you
hear
he
interrupted
lord
john
inquiry
as
to
the
seriousness
of
miss
levering
unpopular
and
mysterious
programme
for
the
afternoon
but
the
lady
quietly
confirmed
it
and
looked
over
her
hostess
shoulder
at
the
that
lady
john
was
silently
holding
out
between
two
extended
hands
indoors
on
a
day
like
this
greatorex
affected
a
mighty
scorn
of
the
document
talk
about
public
sanitation
forsooth
why
god
bless
my
soul
do
you
realize
that
dreadfully
afraid
it
is
said
miss
levering
smiling
down
at
the
architectural
drawing
we
in
the
act
of
discussing
italian
literature
greatorex
held
out
the
little
book
with
an
air
of
comic
despair
you
tell
me
that
is
a
more
savoury
topic
for
a
lady
for
the
tramp
population
less
conducive
to
savouriness
do
you
think
than
baths
she
took
the
book
from
him
shutting
her
handkerchief
in
the
place
where
his
finger
had
been
no
greatorex
panama
in
hand
was
shaking
his
piebald
head
ca
understand
this
morbid
interest
in
vagrants
you
too
much
too
leave
it
to
others
others
the
sort
of
woman
who
smells
of

said
with
smiling
impertinence
typical
english
spinster
you
seen
her
italy
full
of
her
she
never
goes
anywhere
without
a
mackintosh
and
a
collapsible
bath
when
you
look
at
her
it
borne
in
upon
you
that
she
does
only
smell
of
rubber
she
is
rubber
too
they
all
laughed
you
frivolous
people
go
away
lady
john
said
only
got
a
few
minutes
to
talk
over
the
terms
of
the
late
barlow
munificence
before
the
carriage
comes
for
miss
levering
in
the
midst
of
the
general
movement
to
the
garden
freddy
asked
farnborough
did
he
know
she
got
that
old
horror
to
give
lady
john
for
her
charity
before
he
died
got
him
to
demanded
greatorex
levering
answered
lady
john
would
do
it
for
me
but
she
brought
him
round
jove
said
freddy
expect
so
freddy
beamed
in
turn
at
her
lord
and
at
farnborough
as
she
strolled
with
them
through
the
window
she
wonderful
wonderful
said
greatorex
to
the
lady
in
question
lowering
his
voice
waste
your
time
on
the
wrong
people
shall
waste
less
of
my
time
after
this
miss
levering
spoke
thoughtfully
relieved
to
hear
it
i
ca
see
you
wheedling
money
for
shelters
and
rot
of
that
sort
out
of
retired
grocers
see
you
call
it
rot
we
could
have
got
out
of
speaking
still
lower
not
sure
he
said
slyly
she
looked
at
him
i
gave
you
that
much
for
your
little
projects
what
would
you
give
me
he
demanded
did
ask
that
she
spoke
quietly
he
echoed
with
a
truly
horrified
look
should
think
not
lord
john
caught
up
the
name
on
his
way
out
with
jean
two
still
talking
barlow
how
flattered
the
old
beggar
be
did
you
hear
he
turned
back
and
linked
his
arm
in
greatorex
you
hear
what
heriot
said
about
him
so
kind
so
munificent
so
poor
soul
we
could
know
him
in
london
but
we
shall
meet
him
in
heaven
the
two
men
went
out
chuckling
jean
stood
hesitating
a
moment
glancing
through
the
window
at
the
laughing
men
and
back
at
the
group
of
women
heriot
seated
magisterially
at
the
head
of
the
looking
with
inimical
eyes
at
miss
levering
who
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
with
head
bent
over
the
plan
here
my
dear
lady
john
called
to
her
then
with
a
glance
at
her
niece
need
stay
jean
this
wo
interest
you
miss
levering
glanced
over
her
shoulder
as
she
moved
to
the
chair
opposite
lady
john
and
in
the
tone
of
one
agreeing
with
the
dictum
just
uttered
only
an
effort
to
meet
the
greatest
evil
in
the
world
she
said
and
sat
down
with
her
back
to
the
girl
do
you
call
the
greatest
evil
in
the
world
jean
asked
a
quick
look
passed
between
heriot
and
lady
john
miss
levering
answered
without
emphasis
helplessness
of
women
the
girl
still
stood
where
the
phrase
had
arrested
her
after
a
moment
hesitation
lady
john
went
over
to
her
and
put
an
arm
about
her
shoulder
know
darling
you
can
think
of
nothing
but
him
so
just
go
indeed
interrupted
the
girl
brightly

think
of
everything
better
than
i
ever
did
before
he
has
lit
up
everything
for
me
made
everything
vivider
more
more
significant
has
miss
levering
asked
turning
round
as
though
she
had
not
heard
jean
went
on
yes
i
do
care
about
other
things
less
but
a
thousand
times
more
in
love
said
lady
john
that
it
i
congratulate
you
over
her
shoulder
miss
levering
smiled
at
the
girl
now
lady
john
returned
to
the
outspread
plan
you
see
obviates
the
difficulty
you
raised
it
a
great
improvement
miss
levering
agreed
heriot
joining
in
for
the
first
time
spoke
with
emphasis
it
going
to
cost
a
great
deal
more
worth
it
said
miss
levering
we
have
nothing
left
for
the
organ
at
st
pilgrim
dear
lydia
said
lady
john
putting
the
organ
aside
ca
afford
to
put
aside
the
elevating
influence
of
music
heriot
spoke
with
some
asperity
we
must
make
for
first
is
the
cheap
and
humanely
conducted
are
several
of
those
already
but
poor
pilgrim
are
none
for
the
poorest
women
said
miss
levering
even
the
excellent
barlow
was
for
multiplying
rowton
houses
you
can
never
get
men
to
realize
you
ca
always
get
women
the
work
least
able
to
wait
said
miss
levering
do
agree
with
you
heriot
bridled
i
happen
to
have
spent
a
great
deal
of
my
life
in
works
of
charity
then
miss

lifted
her
eyes
from
the
map
to
face
be
interested
in
the
girl
i
saw
dying
in
a
tramp
ward
a
little
while
ago
her
cough
was
worse
only
she
must
die
before
her
father
two
reasons
nobody
but
her
to
keep
the
old
man
out
of
the
workhouse
and
father
is
so
proud
if
she
died
first
he
would
starve
worst
of
all
he
might
hear
what
had
happened
up
in
london
to
his
girl
with
an
air
of
profound
suspicion
heriot
interrupted
did
say
i
suppose
how
she
happened
to
fall
so
low
she
did
she
had
been
in
service
she
lost
the
train
back
one
sunday
night
and
was
too
terrified
of
her
employer
to
dare
to
ring
him
up
after
hours
the
wrong
person
found
her
crying
on
the
platform
should
have
gone
to
one
of
the
friendly
societies

after

got
to
the
journey

heriot
eyes
flashed
but
before
she
could
speak
jean
asked
is

now

lady
john
turned
again
to
the
plan
nights
ago
she
was
waiting
at
a
street
corner
in
the
rain
a
i
suppose
heriot
threw
in
a
sort
of
she
was
plainly
dying
she
was
told
she
should
be
out
in
the
rain
i
must
go
in
yet
she
said
is
what
he
gave
me
and
she
began
to
cry
in
her
hand
were
two
pennies
silvered
over
to
look
like

believe
that
story
heriot
announced
just
the
sort
of
thing
some
trumps
up
now
who
tells
you
these
credible
people
i
did
believe
them
till
jean
came
nearer
i
saw

myself

heriot

aghast

jean
whispered

on
an
old
gown
and
a
tawdry
hat
she
turned
suddenly
to
her
hostess

how
many
things
are
hidden
from
a
woman
in
good

the
bold
free
look
of
a
man
at
a
woman
he
believes
to
be
destitute
you
must
that
look
on
you
before
you
can
understand
a
good
half
of
history
heriot
rose
as
her
niece
sat
down
on
the
footstool
just
below
the
did
you
go
dressed
like
that
the
girl
asked
among
the
homeless
women
on
a
wet
night
looking
for
shelter
called
heriot
wonder
you
been
ill
lady
john
interposed
hastily
it
like
jean
spoke
under
her
breath
came
the
answer
in
the
same
hushed
tone
so
much
worse
i
dare
not
tell
about
it
even
if
you
were
here
i
could
but
heriot
anger
was
unappeased
need
suppose
darling
that
those
wretched
creatures
feel
it
as
we
would
miss
levering
raised
grave
eyes
girls
who
need
shelter
and
work
are
know
said
heriot
with
an
involuntary
flash
all
the
women
who
make
mistakes
are
is
why
woman
ought
to
take
an
interest
in
this
said
miss
levering
steadily
girl
too
oh
yes
jean
agreed
lady
john
was
very
decisive
is
a
matter
for
us
older
for
a
person
who
has
some
special
knowledge
heriot
amended
with
an
air
of
sly
challenge
ca
pretend
to
have
access
to
such
sources
of
information
as
miss
levering
you
can
she
met
heriot
eye
i
can
give
you
access
as
you
suggest
i
have
some
personal
knowledge
about
homeless
girls
my
dear
with
a
manufactured
cheerfulness
lady
john
turned
it
aside
will
all
come
in
convenient
she
tapped
the
plan
miss
levering
took
no
notice
once
happened
to
me
to
take
offence
at
an
ugly
thing
that
was
going
on
under
my
father
roof
oh
ago
i
was
an
impulsive
girl
i
turned
my
back
on
my
father
house
was
lady
john
glanced
at
her
niece
all
my
relations
said
miss
levering
too
looked
at
jean
i
could
explain
to
your
mother
the
girl
asked
mother
was
dead
i
went
to
london
to
a
small
hotel
and
tried
to
find
employment
i
wandered
about
all
day
and
every
day
from
agency
to
agency
i
was
supposed
to
be
educated
i
been
brought
up
partly
in
paris
i
could
play
several
instruments
and
sing
little
songs
in
four
different
tongues
in
the
pause
jean
asked
nobody
want
you
to
teach
french
or
sing
the
little
songs
heads
of
schools
thought
me
too
young
there
were
people
ready
to
listen
to
my
singing
but
the
terms
they
were
too
hard
soon
my
money
was
gone
i
began
to
pawn
my
trinkets
went
still
no
work
but
by
that
time
i
had
some
real
education
an
unpaid
hotel
bill
and
not
a
shilling
in
the
world
some
girls
think
it
hardship
to
have
to
earn
their
living
the
horror
is
not
to
be
allowed
to
jean
bent
forward
happened
lady
john
stood
up
dear
she
asked
her
visitor
your
things
been
sent
down
i
am
quite
ready
all
but
my
hat
insisted
jean
by
chance
i
met
a
friend
of
my
family
was
lucky
thought
so
he
was
nearly
ten
years
older
than
i
he
said
he
wanted
to
help
me
again
she
paused
did
he
jean
asked
lady
john
laid
her
hand
on
miss
levering
shoulder
after
all
he
did
she
said
do
i
waste
time
over
myself
i
belonged
to
the
little
class
of
armed
women
my
body
born
weak
and
my
spirit
was
broken
by
the
of
slavery
but
as
heriot
was
kind
enough
to
hint
i
do
know
something
about
the
possible
fate
of
homeless
girls
what
was
true
a
dozen
years
ago
is
true
there
are
pleasant
parks
museums
free
libraries
in
our
great
rich
london
and
not
one
single
place
where
destitute
women
can
be
sure
of
work
that
is
killing
or
food
that
is
worse
than
prison
fare
that
why
women
ought
not
to
sleep
o
nights
till
this
shelter
stands
spreading
out
wide
arms
no
said
the
girl
jumping
up
when
it
built
heriot
was
angrily
gathering
up
her
gloves
her
fan
and
her
see
many
of
those
creatures
will
prefer
the
life
they
lead
they
it
a
woman
told
me
one
of
the
sort
that
knows
told
me
many
of
them
like
it
so
much
that
they
are
indifferent
to
the
risk
of
being
sent
to
prison
gives
them
a
she
said
rest
breathed
lady
john
miss
levering
glanced
at
the
clock
as
she
rose
to
go
upstairs
while
lady
john
and
heriot
bent
their
heads
over
the
plan
covertly
talking
jean
ran
forward
and
caught
the
tall
grey
figure
on
the
lower
step
want
to
begin
to
understand
something
of
she
began
in
a
beseeching
tone
horribly
ignorant
miss
levering
looked
down
upon
her
searchingly
a
rather
busy
person
she
said
have
a
quite
special
reason
for
wanting
to
be
ignorant
i
go
to
town
said
jean
impulsively
you
come
and
lunch
with
me
or
let
me
come
to
you
it
was
aunt
lydia
voice
must
go
and
put
my
hat
on
said
miss
levering
hurrying
up
the
stair
heriot
bent
towards
her
sister
and
half
whispered
little
she
minds
talking
about
horrors
turn
me
cold
ugh
i
wonder
if
she
signed
the
visitor
book
lady
john
rose
with
harassed
look
foolishness
john
new
plan
of
keeping
it
in
the
lobby
it
twice
as
likely
to
be
forgotten
all
her
shelter
schemes
she
a
hard
woman
said
aunt
lydia
levering
is
exclaimed
jean
of
course
wo
think
so
she
has
angled
very
adroitly
for
your
sympathy
does
look
protested
the
girl
lady
john
glancing
at
her
niece
seemed
in
some
intangible
way
to
take
alarm
not
sure
but
what
she
does
her
mouth
always
like
this
as
if
she
were
holding
back
something
by
main
force
so
she
is
slipped
out
from
between
aunt
lydia
thin
lips
as
lady
john
disappeared
into
the
lobby
have
i
seen
miss
levering
before
this
summer
jean
asked
she
lived
abroad
the
lady
was
debating
with
herself
know
about
her
i
suppose
do
know
how
aunt
ellen
came
across
her
if
that
what
you
mean
father
was
a
person
everybody
knew
one
of
his
daughters
made
a
very
good
marriage
but
this
one
i
did
bargain
for
you
and
hermione
getting
mixed
up
with
her
do
see
that
we
either
of
us
but
miss
levering
seems
to
go
everywhere
why
should
she
with
sudden
emphasis
must
ask
her
to
eaton
square
said
aunt
lydia
have
heriot
half
rose
from
her
seat
you
have
to
get
out
of
it
am
sure
your
grandfather
would
agree
with
me
i
warn
you
i
stand
by
and
see
that
woman
getting
you
into
her
clutches
why
should
you
think
she
wants
me
in
her
clutches
for
the
pleasure
of
clutching
she
the
kind
that
never
satisfied
till
she
has
everybody
in
the
pitiful
state
your
aunt
in
about
her
richard
farnborough
too
just
on
the
very
verge
of
asking
hermione
to
marry
him
is
that
it
the
girl
smiled
wisely
too
late
heriot
saw
her
misstep
it
and
i
am
sure
if
stonor
knew
what
i
do
he
would
agree
with
me
that
you
must
not
ask
her
to
the
house
course
i
do
anything
he
asked
me
to
but
he
would
give
me
a
reason
and
a
very
good
reason
too
the
pretty
face
was
very
stubborn
aunt
lydia
wore
the
inflamed
look
not
so
much
of
one
who
is
angry
as
of
a
person
who
has
a
cold
in
the
head
give
you
the
reason
she
said
not
a
thing
i
should
have
preferred
to
tell
you
but
i
know
how
difficult
you
are
to
guide
so
i
suppose
you
have
to
know
she
looked
round
and
lowered
her
voice
was
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
i
found
her
horribly
ill
in
a
lonely
welsh
farmhouse
levering
heriot
nodded
had
taken
the
manor
for
that
august
the
farmer
wife
was
frightened
and
begged
me
to
go
and
see
what
i
thought
i
soon
saw
how
it
was
i
thought
she
was
dying
what
was
the
got
no
more
out
of
her
than
the
farmer
wife
did
she
had
no
letters
there
had
been
no
one
to
see
her
except
a
man
down
from
london
a
doctor
nameless
of
course
and
then
this
result
the
farmer
and
his
wife
highly
respectable
people
were
incensed
they
were
for
turning
the
girl
out
but
pitiless
some
of
these
people
are
although
she
had
forfeited
all
claim
still
she
was
a
daughter
of
sir
hervey
levering
i
insisted
they
should
treat
the
girl
humanely
and
we
became
friends
that
is
sort
of
in
spite
of
all
i
did
for
her
did
you
do
i
told
you
and
i
lent
her
money
no
small
sum
either
she
never
paid
it
back
yes
after
a
time
but
i
kept
her
secret
as
much
as
i
knew
you
been
telling
me
was
my
duty
and
i
never
had
her
full
confidence
it
natural
she
all
things
considered
she
might
have
wanted
to
tell
me
who
was
responsible
aunt
lydia
she
ever
said
was
that
she
was
ashamed
heriot
was
fast
losing
her
temper
and
her
fine
feeling
for
the
innocence
of
her
auditor
that
she
had
had
the
courage
to
resist
not
the
original
temptation
but
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
on
her
not
to
go
through
with
it
as
she
said
with
a
shrinking
look
the
girl
wrinkled
her
brows
are
being
so
delicate
i
not
sure
i
understand
only
thing
you
need
understand
said
her
aunt
irritably
that
she
not
a
desirable
companion
for
a
young
girl
there
was
a
pause
did
you
see
her
after
after
heriot
made
a
slight
grimace
met
her
last
winter
at
of
all
places
the
bishop
relations
of
hers
it
was
while
you
were
in
scotland
they
got
her
to
help
with
some
of
their
work
now
she
taken
hold
of
ours
your
aunt
and
uncle
are
quite
foolish
about
her
and
i
debarred
from
taking
any
steps
at
least
till
the
shelter
is
out
of
hand
the
girl
face
was
shadowed
even
a
little
frightened
it
was
evident
she
was
struggling
not
to
give
way
altogether
to
alarm
and
repulsion
do
rather
wonder
that
after
that
she
can
bring
herself
to
talk
about
the
unfortunate
women
of
the
world
effrontery
of
it
said
her
aunt
the
courage
the
girl
put
her
hand
up
to
her
throat
as
if
the
sentence
had
caught
there
presumes
to
set
right
of
course
i
do
in
the
least
poor
soul
but
i
feel
i
owe
it
to
your
dead
mother
to
tell
you
about
her
especially
as
you
old
enough
now
to
know
something
about
life
since
a
girl
need
be
very
old
to
suffer
for
her
ignorance
she
spoke
slowly
moving
a
little
away
but
she
stopped
on
the
final
sentence
she
was
rather
wonderful
have
lived
through
when
she
was
how
old
heriot
rose
with
an
increased
irritation
or
thereabouts
years
younger
than
i
jean
sat
down
on
the
divan
and
stared
at
the
floor
be
abandoned
and
to
come
out
of
it
like
this
heriot
went
to
her
and
laid
her
hand
on
the
girl
shoulder
was
too
bad
to
have
to
tell
you
such
a
sordid
story
of
all
days
is
a
terrible
story
but
this
was
a
bad
time
i
feel
very
sorry
for
women
who
are
happy
she
started
as
a
was
faintly
heard
geoffrey
she
jumped
to
her
feet
stonor
what
makes
you
think
yes
i
sure
i
sure
every
shadow
fled
out
of
her
face
in
the
sudden
burst
of
sunshine
lord
john
hurried
in
from
the
garden
as
the
sounded
louder
do
you
think
is
coming
round
the
drive
jean
caught
hold
of
him
dear
are
those
other
people
all
about
how
am
i
ever
going
to
be
able
to
behave
like
a
girl
who
who
engaged
to
the
only
man
in
the
world
worth
marrying
were
expecting
stonor
all
the
time
exclaimed
aunt
lydia
promised
he
come
to
luncheon
if
it
was
humanly
possible
i
was
afraid
to
tell
you
for
fear
he
be
prevented
lord
john
was
laughing
as
he
went
towards
the
lobby
felt
we
could
have
borne
the
disappointment
felt
i
could
said
the
girl
standing
there
with
a
rapt
look
chapter
xv
she
did
not
look
round
when
dick
farnborough
ran
in
from
the
garden
saying
it
is
it
really
for
just
then
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
great
hall
the
centre
of
a
little
buzz
of
welcome
stonor
tall
figure
appeared
between
host
and
hostess
luck
farnborough
said
under
his
breath
he
hurried
back
and
faced
the
rest
of
the
party
who
were
clustered
outside
the
window
trying
to
look
unconcerned
by
jove
he
set
their
incredulity
at
rest
discreetly
they
glanced
and
craned
and
then
elaborately
turned
their
backs
pretending
to
be
talking
among
themselves
but
as
though
the
girl
standing
there
expectant
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
were
well
aware
of
the
enormous
sensation
the
new
arrival
had
created
she
herself
contributed
nothing
to
it
stonor
came
forward
and
she
met
him
with
a
soft
happy
look
and
the
low
words
a
good
thing
you
managed
it
then
she
made
way
for
heriot
far
more
impressive
greeting
innocent
of
the
smallest
reminder
of
the
last
encounter
it
was
lord
john
who
cut
these
amenities
short
by
chaffing
stonor
for
being
so
enterprising
all
of
a
sudden
your
motoring
out
of
town
to
see
a
supporter
on
sunday
do
know
how
we
ever
covered
the
ground
in
the
old
days
he
answered
no
use
to
stand
for
your
borough
any
more
the
american
you
know
he
runs
for
congress
we
shall
all
be
flying
after
the
thing
we
want
he
smiled
at
jean
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
and
spoke
low
sorts
of
irrelevant
people
here
one
of
them
unable
any
longer
to
resist
the
temptation
was
making
a
second
foray
into
the
hall
do
you
do
mr
stonor
farnborough
stood
there
holding
out
his
hand
the
great
man
seemed
not
to
see
it
but
he
murmured
do
you
do
and
proceeded
to
share
with
lady
john
his
dislike
of
any
means
of
locomotion
except
his
own
legs
or
those
of
a
horse
it
took
a
great
deal
to
disconcert
farnborough
of
us
were
arguing
in
the
last
night
he
said
it
did
hurt
a
candidate
chances
going
about
in
a
motor
as
stonor
not
deigning
to
reply
to
this
paused
the
merest
instant
in
what
he
was
saying
to
his
hostess
lord
john
came
to
the
rescue
of
the
audacious
young
gentleman
we
been
hearing
a
great
many
stories
about
the
unpopularity
of
among
the
class
that
has
got
of
course
sure
lady
john
put
in
gain
more
votes
by
being
able
to
reach
so
many
more
of
your
constituents
than
we
used
i
do
know
said
stonor
sometimes
wondered
whether
the
charm
of
our
presence
was
counterbalanced
by
the
way
we
tear
about
smothering
our
in
dust
and
running
down
their
pigs
and
chickens
not
to
speak
of
their
children
on
the
whole
are
the
prospects
lord
john
asked
shall
have
to
work
harder
than
we
realized
stonor
answered
gravely
farnborough
let
slip
an
i
said
so
meant
for
lady
john
and
then
before
stonor
raised
eyes
the
young
politician
retreated
towards
the
window
but
with
hands
in
his
pockets
and
head
held
high
like
one
who
has
made
his
mark
and
so
in
truth
he
had
for
lady
john
let
drop
one
or
two
phrases
what
he
had
done
his
his
mother
had
been
a
betham
yes
he
was
one
of
the
farnboroughs
of
moore
abbey
though
stonor
made
no
comment
beyond
a
dry
staple
product
of
this
country
young
men
like
that
it
appeared
later
that
lady
john
good
offices
in
favour
of
a
probable
had
not
been
invoked
in
vain
despite
the
menace
of
irrelevant
dotting
the
lawn
immediately
outside
the
windows
the
little
group
on
the
farther
side
of
the
hall
still
stood
there
talking
in
low
tones
with
the
sense
of
intimacy
which
belongs
to
a
family
party
jean
had
slipped
her
arm
in
her
uncle
and
was
smiling
at
stonor
says
he
believes
i
be
able
to
make
a
real
difference
to
his
chances
she
said
half
aside
it
angelic
of
him
laughed
the
great
man
i
pin
all
my
hopes
on
your
being
able
to
counteract
the
pernicious
influence
of
my
glib
wife
want
me
to
have
a
real
share
in
it
all
do
you
geoffrey
course
i
do
he
smiled
into
her
eyes
that
moth
farnborough
whirling
in
the
political
effulgence
was
again
hovering
on
the
outskirts
he
even
made
conversation
to
heriot
as
an
excuse
to
remain
inside
the
window
you
do
mean
seriously
lord
john
asked
his
guest
mean
do
you
that
there
any
possible
complication
about
seat
i
dare
say
it
all
right
stonor
drew
a
sunday
paper
out
of
his
pocket
this
agitation
about
the
woman
question
oddly
enough
it
seems
as
if
it
might
there
just
the
it
affect
the
issue
it
how
god
bless
my
soul
lord
john
transparent
skin
flushed
up
to
his
white
hair
tell
me
any
responsible
person
is
going
even
to
consider
the
lunacy
of
tampering
with
the
british
constitution
heard
that
suggested
though
for
better
reasons
stonor
laughed
but
not
lord
john
over
the
destinies
of
the
empire
he
said
hotly
a
lot
of
ignorant
women
just
because
a
few
of
have
odious
manners
and
violent
tongues
the
sight
of
stonor
cool
impassivity
calmed
him
somewhat
he
went
on
more
temperately
sane
person
sees
that
the
only
trouble
with
england
is
that
too
many
ignorant
people
have
votes
already
penalty
we
pay
for
being
more
republican
than
the
republics
lord
john
had
picked
up
the
sunday
paper
and
glanced
down
a
column
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
you
can
do
what
the
other
four
hundred
have
done
but
the
mere
fact
that
four
hundred
and
twenty
members
have
been
worried
into
promising
support
and
then
once
in
the
house
have
let
the
matter
severely
alone
it
alone
lord
john
burst
out
again
should
think
so
indeed
laughed
stonor
it
a
device
that
somewhat
worn
lord
john
put
on
a
macchiavellian
air
that
sat
rather
incongruously
on
his
honest
english
face
if
they
think
getting
a
future
cabinet
minister
on
their
side
will
be
sufficiently
embarrassing
for
the
cabinet
minister
stonor
caught
sight
of
farnborough
approaching
and
lowered
his
voice
he
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
end
of
the
wide
mantelpiece
and
gave
his
attention
exclusively
to
lord
john
seeming
to
ignore
even
the
pretty
girl
who
still
stood
by
her
uncle
with
a
hand
slipped
through
his
arm
says
much
about
it
stonor
went
on
it
realized
that
the
last
labour
member
and
that
colne
valley
socialist
those
men
got
in
largely
through
the
tireless
activity
of
the
women
suffragettes
exclaimed
the
girl
were
able
to
do
that
always
saying
they
do
favour
party
said
a
voice
stonor
looked
up
and
to
jean
obvious
relief
refrained
from
snubbing
the
irrepressible
farnborough
do
know
what
they
began
stonor
do
farnborough
interrupted
not
anybody
they
simply
agin
the
government
they
say
they
all
socialists
lord
john
gave
a
snort
said
farnborough
with
cool
audacity
only
looks
like
that
jean
turned
quite
pink
with
anxiety
she
and
all
who
knew
him
well
had
seen
stonor
crush
the
cocksure
and
the
unwary
with
an
awful
effectualness
but
farnborough
with
the
courage
of
enthusiasm
enthusiasm
for
himself
and
his
own
future
went
stoutly
on
are
liberals
and
even
unionists
among
and
they
do
manage
to
hold
the
balance
pretty
even
i
go
and
hear
them
you
see
speaking
from
the
height
of
your
advantage
although
stonor
was
slightly
satirical
he
was
exercising
an
exceptional
forbearance
you
mean
to
tell
me
they
are
not
more
in
sympathy
with
the
labour
party
than
with
any
other
they
are
it
not
because
the
suffragists
are
all
for
socialism
but
because
the
labour
party
is
the
only
one
that
puts
women
suffrage
in
the
forefront
of
its
programme
stonor
took
his
elbow
off
the
mantel
the
reason
he
said
airily
result
is
momentarily
inconvenient
though
i
am
one
of
those
who
think
it
would
be
easy
to
overestimate
the
importance
he
broke
off
with
an
effect
of
dismissing
both
the
matter
and
the
man
as
he
turned
away
he
found
himself
without
the
smallest
warning
face
to
face
with
vida
levering
she
had
come
down
the
great
staircase
unobserved
and
unobserving
her
head
bent
and
she
in
the
act
of
forcing
a
recalcitrant
hatpin
through
her
hat
doing
it
under
certain
disadvantages
as
she
held
her
gloves
and
her
veil
in
one
hand
as
she
paused
there
confronting
the
tall
figure
of
the
although
it
was
obvious
that
her
unpreparedness
was
not
less
than
his
own
there
was
to
the
most
acute
eye
nothing
in
the
remotest
degree
dramatic
about
the
encounter
hardly
more
than
a
cool
surprise
and
yet
there
was
that
which
made
jean
say
smiling
you
know
one
another
already
in
this
part
of
the
world
knows
stonor
the
lady
said
he
does
know
me
is
miss
levering
you
knew
her
father
did
you
even
before
lady
john
had
introduced
them
the
people
in
the
garden
seemed
not
to
be
able
to
support
the
prospect
of
miss
threatened
monopoly
of
the
lion
they
swarmed
in
hermione
heriot
and
paul
filey
appearing
for
the
first
time
since
church
they
overflowed
into
the
hall
while
jean
dunbarton
with
artless
enthusiasm
was
demanding
of
miss
levering
if
the
reason
she
knew
stonor
was
that
she
had
been
hearing
him
speak
the
lady
met
his
eyes
was
visiting
some
relations
near
dutfield
they
took
me
to
hear
you
the
night
the
suffragettes
made
their
customary
row
did
attack
she
reminded
him
will
if
we
win
the
election
he
said
with
a
cynical
anticipation
it
was
a
mark
of
how
far
the
women
cause
had
travelled
that
although
there
was
no
man
there
except
the
ineffectual
farnborough
no
one
to
speak
of
it
even
with
tolerance
there
was
also
no
one
not
even
greatorex
who
any
longer
felt
the
matter
to
be
much
of
a
joke
here
again
in
this
gathering
was
happening
what
the
unprejudiced
observer
was
seeing
in
similar
circumstances
all
over
england
the
mere
mention
of
women
suffrage
in
general
society
rarest
of
happenings
now
that
topic
which
had
been
the
prolific
mother
of
so
much
merriment
bred
in
these
days
but
silence
and
constraint
the
changed
the
topic
amid
a
general
sense
of
grateful
relief
the
thing
could
be
laughed
at
any
longer
but
it
could
still
be
pretended
it
was
there
come
just
in
time
to
rescue
me
freddy
said
sparkling
at
stonor
do
appear
to
be
in
any
serious
danger
he
said
i
am
or
i
they
were
just
insisting
i
should
go
upstairs
and
change
my
frock
there
anybody
here
so
difficult
as
not
to
like
that
one
she
made
him
a
smart
little
curtsey
we
going
to
have
luncheon
in
less
than
an
hour
somebody
was
going
to
insist
out
of
pure
mistaken
philanthropy
in
taking
me
for
a
walk
i
told
freddy
that
when
i
departed
for
realms
of
bliss
he
is
to
put
on
my
tombstone
died
of
changing
her
clothes
i
know
the
end
will
come
some
sunday
we
appear
at
breakfast
dressed
for
church
that
a
long
skirt
we
are
usually
shooed
upstairs
directly
we
get
back
to
put
on
a
short
one
so
that
we
can
go
and
look
at
the
kennels
or
the
prize
bull
we
come
back
muddy
and
smelling
of
stables
we
get
into
something
fresh
for
luncheon
after
luncheon
some
one
says
walk
another
short
skirt
we
come
back
draggled
and
dreadful
we
change
something
sweetly
feminine
for
tea
the
gong
we
rush
and
dress
for
dinner
you
saved
me
one
change
anyhow
you
are
my
benefactor
why
do
you
ask
after
my
babies
how
are
the
young
barbarians
he
rubbed
his
hand
over
the
lower
part
of
his
face
concern
for
personal
appearance
reminds
me
that
a
little
soap
and
water
after
my
dusty
drive
little
as
had
fallen
from
him
since
his
entrance
as
he
followed
lord
john
upstairs
he
left
behind
that
sense
of
blankness
so
curiously
independent
of
either
words
or
deeds
greatorex
in
his
patent
leather
shoes
and
immaculate
white
gaiters
pattered
over
to
miss
levering
but
she
unkindly
presented
her
back
and
sat
down
at
the
to
make
a
note
on
the
abhorred
shelter
plan
he
showed
his
disapproval
by
marching
off
with
freddy
and
there
was
a
general
trickling
back
into
the
garden
in
that
aimless
mood
but
heriot
and
lady
john
sat
with
their
heads
close
together
on
the
sofa
discussing
in
undertones
the
absorbing
subject
of
the
prospective
new
member
of
the
family
freddy
perched
on
the
edge
of
the
between
miss
levering
who
sat
in
front
of
it
and
jean
whose
chair
was
on
the
other
side
she
was
nearest
jean
but
it
was
to
her
children
sworn
friend
that
she
turned
to
say
enthusiastically
his
coming
in
like
that
and
no
one
needed
to
be
told
whose
coming
brought
delight
must
tell
sara
and
cecil
as
miss
levering
seemed
to
be
still
absorbed
in
making
notes
on
that
boring
plan
the
lively
freddy
turned
to
her
other
neighbour
for
your
thoughts
she
demanded
with
such
suddenness
that
jean
dunbarton
started
and
reddened
very
weighty
to
judge
from
believe
i
was
thinking
it
was
rather
odd
to
hear
two
men
like
my
uncle
and
stonor
talking
about
the
influence
of
the
suffrage
women
really
quite
seriously
she
clutched
freddy
arm
laughing
apologetically
beg
your
pardon
i
forgot
besides
i
was
thinking
of
your
kind
i
was
thinking
of
the
suffragettes
the
only
conceivable
ones
to
be
exercising
any
influence
thank
you
no
no
indeed
i
did
mean
you
did
you
like
the
rest
you
do
realize
how
we
prepared
the
ground
all
the
same
she
went
on
with
her
unfailing
good
humour
frightfully
exciting
seeing
the
question
come
into
practical
politics
at
last
i
only
hope
those
women
wo
go
and
upset
the
again
by
doing
something
that
will
alienate
all
our
good
friends
in
both
parties
it
queer
they
ca
see
our
only
chance
to
get
what
we
want
is
by
winning
over
the
men
there
was
a
low
sound
of
impatience
from
the
person
at
the
and
a
rustle
of
paper
as
the
plan
was
thrown
down
the
matter
said
freddy
winning
over
the
men
has
been
the
woman
way
since
the
creation
do
you
think
the
result
should
make
us
proud
of
our
policy
yes
then
go
and
walk
in
piccadilly
at
midnight
lady
john
and
heriot
rose
as
one
while
miss
levering
was
adding
i
forgot
interposed
heriot
with
majesty
is
not
the
first
time
you
forgotten
i
forgot
was
the
magistrate
ruling
he
said
no
decent
woman
had
any
business
to
be
in
london
main
thoroughfares
at
night
she
has
a
man
with
you
can
hear
that
in
soho
too
you
obliged
to
take
up
with
a
chap
is
what
the
women
say
in
a
highly
significant
silence
heriot
withdrew
with
her
niece
and
freddy
to
where
hermione
sat
contentedly
between
two
young
men
on
the
lady
john
naturally
somewhat
ruffled
but
still
quite
kind
bent
over
her
indiscreet
guest
to
say
an
odd
mood
you
are
in
my
dear
i
think
lydia
right
we
ought
to
do
anything
or
anything
to
encourage
this
ferment
of
feminism
and
i
tell
you
why
it
likely
to
bring
a
very
terrible
thing
in
its
train
terrible
thing
here
say
that
lady
john
spoke
very
gravely
so
conscious
it
here
you
afraid
to
have
it
mentioned
lady
john
perceived
that
jean
had
quietly
slipped
away
from
the
others
and
was
standing
behind
her
if
heriot
had
not
been
too
absorbed
in
dick
farnborough
and
hermione
she
would
have
had
a
moment
pleasure
in
her
handiwork
that
scrutiny
in
jean
dunbarton
face
but
as
the
young
girl
studied
the
quiet
figure
looked
into
the
tender
eyes
that
gazed
so
steadily
into
some
grey
country
far
away
the
effect
of
revelation
was
either
weakened
or
transmuted
subtly
to
something
stronger
than
the
thing
that
it
replaced
as
the
woman
sat
there
leaning
her
head
a
little
wearily
on
her
hand
there
was
about
the
whole
an
indefinable
nobility
that
answered
questions
before
they
were
asked
but
lady
john
upon
perceiving
her
niece
had
said
hurriedly
what
you
say
is
so
it
the
fault
of
those
women
agitators
was
their
invention
miss
levering
answered
woman
begins
that
way
every
woman
is
in
a
state
of
natural
subjection
she
looked
up
and
seeing
jean
face
smiled
rather
say
allegiance
to
her
idea
of
romance
and
her
hope
of
motherhood
they
embodied
for
her
in
man
they
the
strongest
things
in
life
till
man
kills
them
let
be
fair
if
that
allegiance
dies
each
woman
knows
why
lady
john
always
keenly
alive
to
any
change
in
the
social
atmosphere
looked
up
and
saw
her
husband
coming
downstairs
with
their
guest
as
she
went
to
meet
them
stonor
stopped
halfway
down
to
say
something
the
two
men
halted
there
deep
in
discussion
but
scarcely
deeper
than
those
other
two
lady
john
had
left
by
the
is
it
you
are
going
to
marry
miss
levering
had
asked
is
going
to
be
announced
for
a
few
days
yet
and
then
jean
relented
enough
to
say
in
an
undertone
almost
confidentially
should
think
you
guess
what
said
the
other
but
again
lifting
her
eyes
i
going
to
marry
i
know
him
then
she
said
surprised
you
seen
him
miss
levering
shook
her
head
are
so
very
many
young
men
in
the
world
but
she
looked
with
a
moment
wondering
towards
the
window
seeming
to
consider
first
filey
and
then
farnborough
made
you
think
of
going
on
that
terrible
pilgrimage
asked
the
girl
i
heard
at
a
suffrage
meeting
do
you
know
ever
since
that
sunday
at
the
freddys
when
you
told
us
about
the
suffragettes
i
i
been
curious
about
them
said
nothing
would
ever
induce
you
to
listen
to
such
people
know
and
it
rather
silly
but
one
says
a
thing
like
that
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
then
one
is
bound
by
it
mean
one
imagines
one
is
bound
too
i
been
in
scotland
ever
since
but
i
often
thought
about
you
and
what
you
said
that
day
at
the
freddys
yet
you
been
a
good
deal
absorbed
see
the
girl
put
on
a
pretty
little
air
of
superiority
as
if
the
man
i
going
to
marry
was
very
he
wants
me
to
be
intelligent
about
politics
are
those
women
holding
meetings
in
london
now
as
well
as
in
the
constituencies
they
both
became
aware
at
the
same
moment
that
lord
john
was
coming
slowly
down
the
last
steps
with
stonor
still
more
slowly
following
talking
land
tenure
as
miss
levering
rose
and
hurriedly
turned
over
the
things
on
the
table
to
look
for
her
veil
the
handkerchief
she
had
shut
in
her
little
italian
book
dropped
out
a
further
shifting
of
plans
and
papers
sent
it
unobserved
to
the
floor
jean
put
once
more
the
question
that
had
remained
unanswered
collect
too
great
crowds
miss
levering
answered
her
authorities
wo
let
them
meet
in
trafalgar
square
after
they
have
their
last
meeting
there
at
three
that
no
use
to
people
out
of
town
unless
i
could
invent
some
excuse
till
you
can
go
without
inventions
and
excuses
think
all
that
wrong
think
it
rather
undignified
do
i
but
if
i
ever
to
go
lord
john
came
forward
leaving
stonor
to
his
hostess
talking
over
your
shelter
plan
he
asked
benevolently
answered
miss
levering
left
the
shelter
some
time
ago
he
pinched
his
niece
ear
with
affectionate
playfulness
what
all
this
chatterment
about
the
girl
a
little
confused
looked
at
her
latest
things
in
veils
said
miss
levering
smiling
as
she
caught
up
hers
invincible
frivolity
of
women
said
lord
john
with
immense
geniality
they
coming
for
you
jean
said
forget
your
book
when
shall
i
see
you
again
i
wonder
but
instead
of
announcing
the
carriage
the
servant
held
out
a
salver
on
it
lay
a
telegraph
form
scribbled
over
in
pencil
telephone
message
miss
me
said
jean
in
surprise
miss
i
did
know
you
was
here
miss
they
asked
me
to
write
it
down
and
let
you
have
it
as
soon
as
possible
knew
how
it
would
be
if
i
gave
in
about
that
telephone
lord
john
arraigned
his
wife
even
stonor
had
to
sympathize
wo
leave
people
in
peace
even
one
day
in
the
week
got
your
book
jean
said
looking
at
miss
levering
over
the
top
of
the
telegraph
form
and
then
glancing
at
the
title
as
she
restored
the
volume
to
its
owner
whereabouts
are
you
she
opened
it
without
waiting
to
hear
the
inferno
i
in
a
worse
place
said
the
other
smiling
vaguely
as
she
drew
on
her
gloves
did
know
there
was
a
worse
it
worse
with
the
vigliacchi
forget
were
they
guelf
or
ghibelline
were
either
and
that
was
why
dante
could
stand
them
he
said
there
was
no
place
in
heaven
nor
in
purgatory
not
even
a
corner
in
hell
for
the
souls
who
had
stood
aloof
from
strife
the
smile
faded
as
she
stood
there
looking
steadily
into
the
girl
eyes
called
them
wretches
who
never
lived
dante
did
because
they
never
felt
the
pangs
of
partisanship
and
so
they
wander
homeless
on
the
skirts
of
limbo
among
the
abortions
and
of
creation
the
girl
drew
a
fluttering
breath
miss
levering
glanced
at
the
clock
and
turned
away
to
make
her
leisurely
adieux
among
the
group
at
the
window
heriot
left
it
at
once
was
that
about
a
telephone
message
jean
darling
the
girl
glanced
at
the
paper
and
then
quite
suddenly
said
to
lady
john
ellen
i
got
to
go
to
london
dear
child
your
grandfather
worse
no
i
do
think
my
grandfather
is
any
worse
but
i
must
go
all
the
same
go
away
whispered
heriot
stonor
me
up
jean
whispered
to
lady
john
said
he
have
to
leave
directly
after
luncheon
and
anyhow
all
these
people
please
have
us
another
time
just
see
miss
levering
off
said
lady
john
then
i
come
back
and
talk
about
it
in
the
midst
of
the
that
was
going
on
over
by
the
window
jean
suddenly
exclaimed
may
be
another
train
miss
levering
but
stonor
was
standing
in
front
of
the
girl
barring
the
way
if
there
is
i
take
you
back
in
my
motor
he
said
aside
you
in
her
rapture
at
the
thought
jean
clasped
her
hands
and
the
paper
fluttered
to
the
floor
i
must
be
there
by
three
she
said
he
had
picked
up
the
telegraph
form
as
well
as
the
handkerchief
lying
near
it
only
an
invitation
to
dine
wednesday
she
took
the
paper
i
see
he
smiled
and
lowered
his
voice
rather
dear
of
you
to
arrange
our
going
off
like
that
you
a
clever
little
girl
not
exactly
that
i
was
arranging
i
want
to
hear
those
women
in
trafalgar
square
the
suffragettes
he
stared
at
her
more
than
half
incredulous
but
smiling
still
perfectly
absurd
besides
he
looked
across
the
room
at
lady
john
i
expect
she
would
like
my
carrying
you
off
like
that
she
have
to
make
an
excuse
and
come
too
it
would
be
quite
the
same
if
she
did
that
but
jean
had
thought
it
out
ellen
and
i
could
get
back
quite
well
in
time
for
dinner
the
group
that
had
closed
about
the
departing
guest
dissolved
are
you
saying
as
if
you
were
never
coming
back
lord
john
demanded
never
knows
miss
levering
laughed
i
sha
come
back
talk
as
if
you
meant
never
said
freddy
i
do
mean
never
she
nodded
to
stonor
he
bowed
ceremoniously
come
back
what
nonsense
are
you
talking
said
lady
john
it
premonition
of
death
or
do
you
like
us
any
more
laughed
her
husband
the
little
group
trailed
across
the
great
room
escorting
the
guest
to
the
front
door
lady
john
leading
the
way
as
they
passed
geoffrey
stonor
was
obviously
not
listening
very
attentively
to
enthusiastic
explanation
of
her
plan
for
the
afternoon
he
kept
his
eyes
lowered
they
rested
on
the
handkerchief
he
had
picked
up
but
hardly
as
if
after
all
they
saw
it
though
he
turned
the
filmy
square
from
corner
to
corner
with
an
air
partly
of
nervousness
partly
of
abstraction
it
mine
asked
jean
he
paused
an
instant
yours
he
said
mechanically
and
held
out
the
handkerchief
to
miss
levering
she
seemed
not
to
hear
lord
john
had
blocked
the
door
a
moment
insisting
on
a
date
for
the
next
visit
jean
caught
up
the
handkerchief
and
went
running
forward
with
it
suddenly
she
stopped
glancing
down
at
the
embroidered
corner
that
not
an
l
it
v
i
stonor
turned
his
back
and
took
up
a
magazine
lady
john
voice
sounded
clear
from
the
lobby
must
let
vida
go
john
or
she
miss
her
train
miss
levering
vanished
did
know
her
name
was
vida
how
did
you
said
jean
stonor
bent
his
head
silently
over
the
book
perhaps
he
had
heard
that
deafening
old
gong
was
sounding
for
luncheon
chapter
xvi
the
last
of
the
trafalgar
square
meetings
was
half
over
when
the
great
motor
containing
three
persons
besides
the
chauffeur
slowed
up
on
the
west
side
of
the
square
neither
of
the
two
ladies
in
their
veils
was
easily
recognizable
still
less
the
countenance
of
the
hon
geoffrey
stonor
when
he
took
off
his
motor
glasses
he
did
not
turn
down
his
dust
collar
he
even
pulled
farther
over
his
eyes
the
peak
of
his
linen
cap
by
coming
at
all
on
this
expedition
he
had
given
jean
a
signal
proof
of
his
desire
to
please
her
but
it
was
plain
that
he
had
no
mind
to
see
in
the
papers
that
he
had
been
assisting
at
such
a
spectacle
while
he
gave
instructions
as
to
where
the
car
should
wait
jean
was
staring
at
the
vast
crowd
massed
on
the
north
side
of
the
column
it
extended
back
among
the
fountains
and
even
escaped
on
each
side
beyond
the
vigilance
of
the
guardian
lions
there
were
scores
listening
there
who
could
not
see
the
speakers
even
as
well
as
could
the
occupants
of
the
car
in
front
of
the
little
row
of
women
on
the
plinth
a
gaunt
figure
in
brown
serge
was
waving
her
arms
what
she
was
saying
was
blurred
in
the
general
uproar
that
one
jean
called
out
excitedly
let
hurry
but
even
after
they
left
the
car
and
reached
the
crowd
to
hurry
was
a
thing
no
man
could
do
for
some
minutes
the
had
only
occasional
glimpses
of
the
speakers
and
heard
little
more
than
fragments
is
that
geoffrey
tall
young
fellow
with
the
stoop
that
appears
to
be
the
chairman
stonor
himself
stooped
to
the
eager
girl
who
had
clutched
his
sleeve
from
behind
and
was
following
him
closely
through
the
press
artless
chairman
i
take
it
is
scolding
the
people
for
not
giving
the
woman
a
hearing
they
laughed
together
at
the
young
man
foolishness
even
had
an
meeting
been
more
of
a
commonplace
to
stonor
it
would
have
had
for
him
that
effect
of
newness
that
an
old
thing
wears
when
seen
by
an
act
of
sympathy
through
new
eyes
must
be
sure
and
explain
to
me
geoffrey
said
the
girl
is
to
be
an
important
chapter
in
my
education
merrily
and
without
a
shadow
of
misgiving
she
spoke
in
jest
a
truer
word
than
she
dreamed
he
fell
in
with
her
mood
i
rather
gather
that
he
been
criticizing
the
late
government
and
liberals
have
made
it
hot
for
him
shall
never
be
able
to
hear
unless
we
get
nearer
said
jean
anxiously
a
very
rough
element
in
front
there
do
let
us
mind
certainly
i
mind
but
i
should
be
miserable
if
i
did
hear
she
pleaded
so
bewitchingly
for
a
front
seat
at
the
show
that
unwillingly
he
wormed
his
way
on
suddenly
he
stood
still
and
stared
about
the
matter
said
lady
john
ca
have
you
ladies
pushed
about
in
this
crowd
he
said
under
his
breath
must
get
hold
of
a
policeman
you
wait
just
here
i
find
one
the
adoring
eyes
of
the
girl
watched
the
tall
figure
disappear
at
her
face
lady
john
with
her
eyeglass
up
was
staring
in
the
opposite
direction
like
an
inspired
charwoman
jean
turned
and
in
her
eagerness
pressed
on
lady
john
following
the
agreeable
presence
of
the
young
chairman
was
withdrawn
from
the
and
the
figure
of
the
stood
alone
with
her
lean
brown
finger
pointing
straight
at
the
more
outrageous
of
the
young
hooligans
and
her
voice
raised
shrill
above
their
impertinence
got
boys
of
me
own
she
said
we
laugh
at
all
sorts
things
but
i
should
be
ashymed
and
so
would
they
if
ever
they
wus
to
as
you
doin
when
they
had
duly
hooted
that
sentiment
they
were
quieter
for
a
moment
been
sayin
this
is
a
woman
movement
a
libel
i
a
workin
woman
the
wife
of
a
workin
man
devil
envy
as
one
giving
her
credentials
she
went
on
a
pore
law
guardian
o
that
now
gracious
me
a
friendly
person
in
the
crowd
turned
upon
the
scoffer
up
caw
yer
fur
you
further
statements
on
the
part
of
the
orator
were
drowned
by
and
darn
your
ol
man
stockin
clean
yer
doorstep
she
glowered
her
contempt
upon
the
interrupters
it
a
pore
sort
of
that
leaves
doorstep
till
sunday
afternoon
maybe
when
you
would
do
your
doorstep
i
do
mine
in
the
mornin
before
you
men
are
awake
they
relished
that
and
gave
her
credit
for
a
bull
eye
think
she
went
on
quietly
seeing
she
had
them
think
we
women
no
business
servin
on
boards
and
thinking
about
politics
in
a
tone
of
exquisite
contempt
wot
politics
she
demanded
just
on
a
big
scyle
somebody
applauded
among
you
workin
men
the
most
comfortable
those
of
you
that
gives
yer
wives
yer
wyges
it
that
it
they
roared
with
passion
our
money
all
this
agitation
about
to
me
she
came
close
to
the
edge
of
the
plinth
it
wus
only
to
use
fur
comfort
d
think
many
o
you
workin
men
would
be
found
turnin
over
their
wyges
to
their
wives
no
wot
the
reason
thousands
do
and
the
best
and
the
soberest
because
the
workin
man
knows
that
wot
a
pound
to
is
twenty
shillins
to
wife
and
she
myke
every
penny
in
every
one
o
them
shillins
she
gets
more
fur
out
of
wyges
than
wot
can
some
o
you
know
wot
the
is
like
the
men
let
the
women
manage
well
the
poor
laws
and
the
government
is
just
in
the
syme
muddle
because
the
men
tried
to
do
the
national
without
the
women
they
hooted
but
they
listened
too
i
said
to
you
before
it
a
libel
to
say
it
only
the
women
wot
wantin
the
vote
i
can
tell
you
wot
plenty
o
the
poor
women
think
about
it
i
one
o
them
and
i
can
tell
you
we
see
reforms
needed
ought
to
the
and
we
know
to
appreciate
the
other
women
go
to
prison
for
tryin
to
get
it
for
us
with
a
little
final
bob
of
emphasis
and
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
at
the
old
woman
and
the
young
one
behind
her
she
was
about
to
retire
but
she
paused
as
the
murmur
in
the
crowd
grew
into
distinct
phrases
policemen
rows
in
the
street
and
a
voice
called
out
so
near
jean
that
the
girl
jumped
the
yer
goes
on
as
mykes
keep
ye
from
gettin
votes
they
see
ye
ai
fit
to
and
then
all
the
varied
charges
were
swallowed
in
a
general
uproar
geoffrey
oh
she
too
funny
for
words
the
agitated
chairman
had
come
forward
evidently
do
know
he
said
had
to
be
done
by
before
the
extension
of
suffrage
in
if
it
had
been
for
demonstrations
but
the
rest
was
drowned
the
woman
stood
there
waiting
wavering
a
moment
and
suddenly
her
shrill
note
rose
clear
over
the
indistinguishable
babel
woman
plyce
is
do
you
know
there
a
third
of
the
women
in
this
country
ca
afford
the
luxury
of
stayin
in
their
they
to
go
out
and
make
money
to
the
rent
and
keep
the
from
bein
sold
up
then
there
all
the
women
that
got
even
miserable
they
got
any
said
got
one
do
you
stop
in
it
that
like
a
man
if
one
o
you
is
all
right
he
thinks
the
rest
do
matter
we
women
but
they
overwhelmed
her
she
stood
there
with
her
gaunt
arms
folded
waiting
you
felt
that
she
had
met
other
crises
of
her
life
with
just
that
same
smouldering
patience
when
the
wave
of
noise
subsided
again
she
was
discovered
to
be
speaking
are
all
right
your
children
never
goes
you
are
livin
old
and
young
married
and
single
in
one
room

jean
dunbarton
turned
round
to
say

her
aunt

plyce

lean
arms
with
me
to
canning

with
me
to
bromley

and
to

she
waited
in
vain
for
the
answer
her
voice
quivered
your
children
never
goes
and
maybe
you

though
i
must
say
i

some
one
said
as
she
retired
against
the
banner
with
the
others
there
was
some
applause
now
said
a
man
patronizingly
wus
so
bad
fur
a
woman
naw
not
fur
a
woman
jean
had
been
standing
on
making
signals
ah
at
last
geoffrey
saw
her
but
why
was
he
looking
so
grave
policeman
lady
john
asked
on
that
side
they
seem
to
have
surrounded
the
storm
centre
which
is
just
in
front
of
the
place
you
rather
unwisely
chosen
indeed
it
was
possible
to
see
further
on
half
a
dozen
helmets
among
the
hats
what
was
happening
on
the
plinth
seemed
to
have
a
lessened
interest
for
jean
dunbarton
she
kept
glancing
sideways
up
under
the
cap
brim
at
the
eyes
of
the
man
at
her
side
lady
john
on
the
other
hand
was
losing
nothing
one
of
them
that
little
thing
i
suppose
so
answered
stonor
doubtfully
though
the
chairman
with
a
cheerful
air
of
relief
had
introduced
miss
ernestine
blunt
to
the
accompaniment
of
cheers
and
a
general
moving
closer
to
the
monument
lady
john
after
studying
ernestine
an
instant
through
her
glass
turned
to
a
dingy
person
next
her
who
was
smoking
a
short
pipe
those
women
up
there
said
lady
john
you
tell
me
my
man
which
are
the
ones
that
a
that
make
the
disturbances
the
man
removed
his
pipe
and
spat
carefully
between
his
feet
then
with
deliberation
he
said
one
that
doing
the
talking
now
she
the
disturbingest
o
the
lot
that
nice
little
you
be
took
in
mum
and
he
resumed
the
consolatory
pipe
is
it
geoffrey
have
i
done
anything
jean
said
very
low
did
you
stay
where
i
left
you
he
answered
without
looking
at
her
could
hear
i
could
even
see
please
do
look
like
that
forgive
me
she
pleaded
covertly
seeking
his
hand
his
set
face
softened
frightened
me
when
i
did
see
you
where
i
left
you
she
smiled
with
recovered
spirits
she
could
attend
now
to
the
thing
she
had
come
to
see
sorry
you
missed
the
inspired
charwoman
it
rather
upsetting
to
think
do
you
suppose
any
of
our
servants
have
views
stonor
laughed
no
our
servants
are
all
too
superior
he
moved
forward
and
touched
a
policeman
on
the
shoulder
what
was
said
was
not
audible
the
policeman
at
first
shook
his
head
then
suddenly
he
turned
round
looked
sharply
into
the
gentleman
face
and
his
whole
manner
changed
obliging
genial
almost
obsequious
he
recognized
geoffrey
jean
said
to
her
aunt
to
do
what
a
member
tells
them
they
stop
the
traffic
any
time
to
let
geoffrey
go
by
she
exulted
stonor
beckoned
to
his
ladies
the
policeman
was
forging
a
way
in
which
they
followed
will
do
stonor
said
at
last
and
he
whispered
again
to
the
policeman
the
man
replied
grinning
really
stonor
smiled
too
is
the
redoubtable
miss
ernestine
blunt
he
explained
over
his
shoulder
and
he
drew
back
so
that
jean
could
pass
and
standing
so
directly
in
front
of
him
she
could
be
protected
right
and
left
if
need
were
by
a
barrier
made
of
his
arms
can
you
see
he
asked
she
looked
round
and
nodded
her
face
was
without
cloud
again
she
leaned
lightly
against
his
arm
miss
ernestine
had
meanwhile
been
catapulting
into
election
issues
with
all
the
fervour
of
a
outrageous
things
she
says
about
important
people
people
she
ought
to
respect
and
be
rather
afraid
of
objected
jean
rather
scandalized
little
baggage
said
stonor
reasons
a
plenty
the
baggage
had
why
the
party
which
had
so
recently
refused
to
enfranchise
women
should
not
be
returned
to
power
in
too
big
a
hurry
some
one
shouted
the
liberals
want
is
a
little
time
you
seem
not
to
know
that
the
first
petition
in
favour
of
giving
us
the
franchise
was
signed
in
do
know
she
paused
a
moment
taken
off
her
guard
by
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
was
there
was
the
trouble
haw
haw
petition
she
said
presented
forty
years
ago
a
now
she
got
out
of
crydle
was
presented
to
the
house
of
commons
by
john
stuart
mill
give
the
liberals
time
she
echoed
years
ago
memorials
in
favour
of
the
suffrage
were
presented
to
gladstone
and
disraeli
in
women
of
these
british
isles
signed
an
appeal
to
the
members
of
parliament
bills
or
resolutions
have
been
before
the
house
on
and
off
for
the
last
years
all
that
time
thrown
away
at
the
opening
of
this
year
we
found
ourselves
with
no
assurance
that
if
we
went
on
in
the
same
way
any
girl
born
into
the
world
in
our
time
would
ever
be
able
to
exercise
the
rights
of
citizenship
though
she
lived
to
be
a
hundred
that
was
why
we
said
all
this
has
been
in
vain
we
must
try
some
other
way
how
did
you
working
men
get
the
suffrage
we
asked
ourselves
well
we
turned
up
the
records
and
we
we
want
to
follow
such
a
violent
example
we
would
much
rather
not
but
if
that
the
only
way
we
can
make
the
country
see
we
in
earnest
we
are
prepared
to
show
them
they
show
ye
another
month
in
the
midst
of
the
laughter
and
interruptions
a
dirty
beery
fellow
of
fifty
or
so
from
whom
stonor
arm
was
shielding
jean
turned
to
the
pal
behind
him
with
yer
like
to
be
one
think
o
comin
to
soon
learn
answered
the
other
with
a
meaning
look
think
that
going
to
prison
again
has
any
fears
for
us
we
go
for
life
if
by
doing
that
we
got
freedom
for
the
rest
of
the
women
hear
do
the
men
ye
to
get
yer
rights
some
one
asking
why
the
men
do
help
it
partly
they
understand
yet
they
before
we
done
she
wagged
her
head
in
a
sort
of
comical
menace
and
the
crowd
screamed
with
laughter
they
do
understand
yet
what
at
stake
said
an
old
fellow
with
a
rich
chuckle
a
educatin
of
us
and
partly
that
the
bravest
man
is
afraid
of
ridicule
oh
yes
heard
a
great
deal
all
our
lives
about
the
timidity
and
the
sensitiveness
of
women
and
it
true
we
sensitive
but
i
tell
you
ridicule
crumples
a
man
up
it
steels
a
woman
we
come
to
know
the
value
of
ridicule
we
educated
ourselves
so
that
we
welcome
ridicule
we
owe
our
sincerest
thanks
to
the
comic
writers
the
cartoonist
is
our
unconscious
friend
who
cartoons
people
who
are
of
no
importance
what
advertisement
is
so
sure
of
being
remembered
if
we
did
know
it
by
any
other
sign
the
comic
papers
would
tell
us
she
stood
there
for
one
triumphant
moment
in
an
attitude
of
such
audacious
that
jean
turned
excitedly
to
her
lover
with
know
what
she
like
the
girl
in
ibsen
master
builder
do
think
i
know
the
young
lady
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
that
set
the
master
builder
nerves
quivering
he
felt
in
his
bones
it
was
the
younger
generation
coming
to
upset
things
he
it
was
a
young
man
it
was
really
miss
ernestine
blunt
he
has
my
sympathies
the
younger
generation
was
declaring
from
the
monument
greatest
debt
of
gratitude
we
owe
to
the
man
who
called
us
female
hooligans
that
tickled
the
crowd
too
she
was
such
a
charming
little
specimen
of
a
hooligan
being
frightfully
amused
geoffrey
said
jean
he
looked
down
at
her
with
a
large
indulgence
right
he
said
are
hooligans
but
we
hope
the
fact
will
be
overlooked
if
everybody
said
we
were
nice
women
who
come
to
hear
us
the
the
people
dissolved
in
laughter
but
she
was
grave
enough
tell
us
it
is
womanly
for
us
to
care
about
politics
how
do
they
know
what
womanly
it
for
women
to
decide
that
let
them
attend
to
being
manly
it
will
take
them
all
their
time
benighted
man
of
you
have
heard
it
would
be
dreadful
if
we
got
the
vote
because
then
we
be
pitted
against
men
in
the
economic
struggle
but
it
too
late
to
guard
against
that
it
fact
but
facts
we
discovered
are
just
what
men
find
it
so
hard
to
recognize
men
are
so
dreadfully
sentimental
she
smiled
with
the
crowd
at
that
but
she
proceeded
to
hammer
in
her
pet
nail
wo
recognize
those
women
out
of
every
hundred
who
are
we
used
to
believe
men
when
they
told
us
that
it
was
unfeminine
hardly
respectable
for
women
to
be
students
and
to
aspire
to
the
arts
that
bring
fame
and
fortune
but
men
have
never
told
us
it
was
unfeminine
for
women
to
do
the
heavy
drudgery
that
badly
paid
that
kind
of
work
had
to
be
done
by
somebody
and
men
did
hanker
after
it
no
let
the
women
scrub
and
cook
and
wash
or
teach
without
diplomas
on
half
pay
that
all
right
but
if
they
want
to
try
their
hand
at
the
work
of
the
liberal
professions
oh
very
unfeminine
indeed
as
ernestine
proceeded
to
show
how
all
this
obsolete
unfairness
had
its
roots
in
political
inequality
lady
john
dropped
her
glass
with
a
sigh
are
right
she
said
to
jean
is
hilda
harnessed
to
a
purpose
a
portent
to
shake
nerves
with
jean
blooming
there
before
him
stonor
had
no
wish
to
prove
his
own
nerves
think
she
rather
fun
myself
though
she
ought
to
be
taken
home
and
well
smacked
somebody
had
interrupted
to
ask
the
house
of
commons
wo
give
you
justice
why
do
you
go
to
the
house
of
lords
she
had
heard
but
the
question
was
answered
by
some
one
who
had
to
up
case
of
early
closin
be
allowed
to
ask
any
question
you
like
she
said
the
end
of
the
meeting
that
oh
is
it
question
time
i
miss
killed
cock
robin
got
a
question
too
a
boy
called
through
his
hollowed
hands
you
married
your
chance
a
bachelor
a
man
says
ernestine
if
the
women
get
full
citizenship
and
a
war
is
declared
will
the
women
fight
haw
just
tell
us
she
smiled
know
some
say
the
whole
trouble
about
us
is
that
we
fight
but
it
only
hard
necessity
makes
us
do
that
we
do
want
to
fight
as
men
seem
to
just
for
fighting
sake
women
are
for
peace
hear
when
we
have
a
share
in
public
affairs
there
be
less
likelihood
of
war
was
it
a
woman
the
baroness
von
suttner
whose
book
about
peace
was
the
of
the
peace
congress
was
it
that
book
that
converted
the
millionaire
maker
of
armaments
of
war
was
it
the
baroness
von
suttner
book
that
made
nobel
offer
those
great
international
prizes
for
the
arts
of
peace
i
not
saying
women
fight
but
we
women
know
all
war
is
evil
and
we
for
peace
our
part
we
proud
to
remember
it
our
part
has
been
to
go
about
after
you
men
in
war
time
and
up
the
a
great
shout
went
up
as
the
truth
of
that
rolled
in
upon
the
people
seems
funny
does
it
you
men
blow
people
to
bits
and
then
we
come
along
and
put
them
together
again
if
you
know
anything
about
military
nursing
you
know
a
good
deal
of
our
work
has
been
done
in
the
face
of
danger
it
always
been
so
that
so
what
of
it
said
a
voice
must
do
something
for
their
keep
complain
that
more
and
more
we
taking
away
from
you
men
the
work
that
always
been
yours
you
ca
any
longer
keep
woman
out
of
the
industries
the
only
question
is
on
what
terms
shall
she
continue
to
be
in
as
long
as
she
in
on
bad
terms
she
not
only
hurting
herself
she
hurting
you
but
if
you
feeling
discouraged
about
our
competing
with
you
we
willing
to
leave
you
your
trade
in
war
let
the
men
take
life
we
life
her
voice
was
once
more
moved
and
proud
one
will
pretend
ours
is
one
of
the
dangerous
trades
either
i
wo
say
any
more
to
you
now
because
we
got
others
to
speak
to
you
and
a
new
woman
helper
that
i
want
you
to
hear
with
an
accompaniment
of
clapping
she
retired
to
hold
a
hurried
consultation
with
the
chairman
jean
turned
to
see
how
geoffrey
had
taken
it
he
smiled
down
at
her
echoing
so
reprehensible
in
what
she
said
was
there
reprehensible
makes
one
rather
miserable
all
the
same
he
pressed
his
guardian
arm
the
closer
must
take
it
as
much
to
heart
as
all
that
ca
help
it
i
ca
indeed
geoffrey
i
shall
be
able
to
make
a
speech
like
that
he
stared
considerably
taken
aback
hope
not
indeed
i
thought
you
said
you
wanted
me
to
make
nice
little
speeches
with
composure
so
i
did
so
i
do
as
he
looked
down
upon
the
upturned
face
he
seemed
to
lose
his
thread
she
was
for
helping
him
to
recover
it
you
remember
how
you
said
you
have
very
pink
cheeks
well
i
stick
to
it
she
smiled
do
tell
everybody
you
the
only
female
creature
a
most
proper
sentiment
only
one
i
ever
saw
who
did
look
a
fright
in
motor
things
glad
you
do
think
me
a
fright
oh
she
turned
at
the
sound
of
applause
forgetting
all
about
a
big
sandy
man
not
hitherto
seen
was
rolling
his
body
up
and
down
the
platform
smiling
at
the
people
and
mopping
a
great
bony
skull
on
which
low
down
a
few
scanty
wisps
of
colourless
hair
were
growing
you
ca
afford
a
bottle
of
tatcho
a
boy
called
out

grinned

a
public
meetin

in
the
hiatus
with
laughter

a
man
at
too
talkin
about
woman
sphere
do
you
call
it
and
at
the
word
his
suffered
a
singular
eclipse
he
bellowed
as
if
some
one
had
struck
him
in
a
vital
spot
and
the
word
was
merely
a
roar
of
pain
you

a
kennel

munch

tommy

corner

body
up
and
down
the
stone
platform
taking
in
great
draughts
of
cheer
from
some
invisible
fountain
men
here
belongin
to
the
labour
party
he
inquired
to
an
accompaniment
of
shouts
and
applause
he
went
on
smiling
and
rubbing
his
hands
in
a
state
of
bubbling
brotherliness
i
do

those
men

and
while

had
a
little
calmed
down
liberal
he
said
with
that
look
of
sly
humour
the
judicial
sort
o
chap
that
sits
in
the
middle
the
fence
he
nodded
one
side
socialists
the
other
well

always
so
comfortable
in
the
middle
no
yer
like
to
get
squeezed
now
i
says
to
the
women

i
says
is
the
conservatives
do
promise
you
much
but
wot
they
promise
they
he
whacked
one
fist
into
the
other
with
tremendous
effect
fellow
is
half
bad
stonor
said
to
lady
john
the
liberals
they
promise
you
the
earth
and
give
you
the
whole
o
nothin
there
were
roars
of
approval
liberal
stock
had
sunk
rather
low
in
trafalgar
square
it
fun
said
jean
are
you
glad
i
brought
you
this
chap
all
right
men
seen
it
over
and
over
but
the
women
can
tyke
an
quicker
what
we
can
they
wo
stand
the
nonsense
men
do
only
they
got
a
fair
chawnce
even
to
agitate
fur
their
rights
as
i
wus
comin
up
ere
i
a
man
sayin
look
at
this
big
crowd
we
all
if
the
women
want
the
vote
ai
they
here
to
so
well
i
tell
you
it
because
they
to
get
the
dinner
fur
you
and
me
and
now
they
washin
up
dishes
think
we
ought
to
at
and
wash
the
dishes
he
laughed
with
shrewdness
if
they
leave
it
to
us
once
or
twice
we
understand
a
little
more
about
the
woman
question
i
know
wife
is
here
it
because
she
i
ca
cook
and
she
i
can
talk
to
some
purpose
yuss
he
acknowledged
another
possible
view
maybe
she
mistaken
here
i
am
to
vote
for
her
and
all
the
other
women
and
to
they
nearly
drowned
him
with
and
hear
to
tell
you
men
what
improvements
you
can
expect
to
see
women
the
share
in
public
affairs
they
ought
to
out
of
the
babel
came
the
question
do
you
know
about
it
you
ca
even
talk
grammar
his
broad
smile
faltered
a
little
what
shame
said
jean
full
of
sympathy
a
dear
that
funny
cockney
but
he
had
been
dashed
for
the
merest
moment
not
to
talk
grammar
but
to
talk
reform
i
ai
defendin
my
grammar
he
said
on
second
thoughts
i
say
in
pawssing
that
if
my
mother
rights
maybe
my
grammar
would
been
better
it
was
a
thrust
that
seemed
to
go
home
but
all
the
same
it
was
clear
that
many
of
his
friends
could
stomach
the
sight
of
him
up
there
demeaning
himself
by
espousing
the
cause
of
the
suffragettes
he
kept
on
about
woman
and
justice
but
his
performance
was
little
more
than
vigorous
pantomime
the
boyish
chairman
looked
harassed
and
anxious
miss
ernestine
blunt
alert
watchful
stonor
bent
his
head
to
whisper
something
in
jean
dunbarton
ear
she
listened
with
lowered
eyes
and
happy
face
the
discreet
little
interchange
went
on
for
several
minutes
while
the
crowd
booed
at
the
labourite
for
his
mistaken
enthusiasm
geoffrey
stonor
and
his
were
more
alone
now
in
the
midst
of
this
shouting
mob
than
they
had
been
since
the
ulland
house
had
broken
in
upon
and
banished
momentary
wonderment
about
the
name
that
name
beginning
with
plain
to
see
in
the
flushed
and
happy
face
that
jean
dunbarton
was
not
questions
she
was
listening
absorbed
to
the
oldest
of
all
the
stories
and
now
the
champion
of
the
suffragettes
had
come
to
the
surface
again
with
his
a
bit
a
minute
my
man
you
talkin
to
i
ai
your
man
that
lucky
for
me
there
seems
to
be
an
individual
here
who
does
think
women
ought
to
the
vote
they
all
but
wiped
him
out
again
in
laughter
but
he
climbed
on
the
top
of
the
great
wave
of
sound
with
the
gentleman
who
thinks
they
ought
to
a
vote
do
know
much
about
women
wot
oh
the
gentleman
says
married
well
then
fur
the
syke

be
too
sorry

prysed

mykin
a
demonstrytion
in
trafalgar
square
and
i
a
little
peace
and
quiet
at
for
one
sunday
in
me
life
the
crowd
liked
that
and
found
themselves
jeering
at
the
interrupter
as
well
as
at
the
speaker
you
he
pointed
at
some
one
in
the
crowd
like
the
man

this
morning

awskin
me

like
men
to
at

waited
while
slyly
he
brought

place

one
in
a
rage

a
good
many
o

this
was
outrageous
it
was
resented
in
an
incipient
riot
the
helmets
of
the
police
bobbed
about
an
angry
voice
had
called
out
are
you
talkin
to
the
anxiety
of
the
inexperienced
chairman
was
almost
touching
the
socialist
revelled
in
the
disturbance
he
created
he
walked
up
and
down
with
that
funny
rolling
gait
poking
out
his
head
at
intervals
in
a
fashion
highly
provocative
holding
his
huge
paws
kangaroo
fashion
only
with
fingers
stiffly
pointed
and
shooting
them
out
at
intervals
towards
the
crowd
in
a
very
ecstasy
of
contempt
go
and
awsk
yer
wife
to
wash
yer
fice
he
advised
caw
even
do
bit
o
washin
go
and
awsk
woman
there
was
a
scuffle
in
the
crowd
a
section
of
it
surged
up
towards
the
monument
of
us
mean
demanded
a
threatening
voice
said
the
socialist
coolly
looking
down
takes
about
ten
of
your
sort
to
make
a
man
so
you
may
take
it
i
mean
the
lot
of
you
again
the
hands
shot
out
and
scattered
scorn
amongst
his
critics
there
were
angry
indistinguishable
retorts
and
the
crowd
swayed
miss
ernestine
blunt
who
had
been
watching
the
fray
with
serious
face
turned
suddenly
catching
sight
of
some
one
just
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
platform
she
jumped
up
saying
audibly
to
the
speaker
as
she
passed
him
she
is
and
proceeded
to
offer
her
hand
to
help
some
one
to
get
up
the
improvised
steps
behind
the
lion
the
socialist
had
seized
with
fervour
upon
his
last
chance
and
was
flinging
out
showers
of
caustic
advice
among
his
foes
stirring
them
up
to
frenzy
stonor
with
contracted
brows
had
stared
one
dazed
instant
as
the
head
of
the
came
up
behind
the
lion
on
the
left
jean
her
eyes
wide
incredulous
as
though
unable
to
accept
their
testimony
pressed
a
shade
nearer
the
monument
stonor
made
a
sharp
move
forward
and
took
her
by
the
arm
going
now
he
said
yet
oh
not
just
yet
she
pleaded
as
he
drew
her
round
i
do
believe
she
looked
back
with
an
air
almost
bewildered
over
her
shoulder
like
one
struggling
to
wake
from
a
dream
stonor
was
saying
with
decision
to
lady
john
going
to
take
jean
out
of
this
mob
will
you
come
oh
yes
if
you
think
she
had
disengaged
the
chain
of
her
eyeglass
at
last
is
that
surely
it
jean
began
john
tired
he
interrupted
had
enough
of
this
idiotic
you
do
see
who
it
is
geoffrey
that
last
one
is
suddenly
jean
bent
forward
as
he
was
trying
to
extricate
her
from
the
crowd
and
she
looked
in
his
face
something
that
she
found
there
made
her
tighten
her
hold
on
his
arm
ca
run
away
and
leave
aunt
ellen
was
all
she
said
but
her
voice
sounded
scared
stonor
repressed
a
gesture
of
anger
and
came
to
a
standstill
just
behind
two
big
policemen
the
to
that
strange
platform
after
standing
for
some
seconds
with
her
back
to
the
people
and
talking
to
ernestine
blunt
the
tall
figure
in
a
long
dust
coat
and
familiar
hat
had
turned
and
glanced
apprehensively
at
the
crowd
it
was
vida
levering
the
girl
down
in
the
crowd
locked
her
hands
together
and
stood
motionless
the
socialist
had
left
the
platform
with
the
threat
that
he
was
down
now
to
attend
to
that
microbe
that
vitiating
the
air
on
my
right
while
a
lady
will
say
a
few
words
to
you
if
she
can
myke
he
retired
to
a
chorus
of
cheers
and
booing
while
the
chairman
more
harassed
than
ever
it
would
seem
but
determined
to
create
a
diversion
was
saying
that
some
one
had
suggested
it
such
a
good
idea
like
you
to
listen
to
it
that
a
clause
shall
be
inserted
in
the
next
suffrage
bill
that
shall
expressly
give
to
each
cabinet
minister
and
to
any
respectable
man
the
power
to
prevent
a
vote
being
given
to
the
female
members
of
his
family
on
his
public
declaration
of
their
lack
of
sufficient
intelligence
to
entitle
them
to
one
oh
i
ask
you
to
listen
as
quietly
as
you
can
to
a
lady
who
is
not
accustomed
to
speaking
a
in
trafalgar
square
or
a
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
all
dumb
lady
cheers
for
the
dumb
lady
the
chairman
was
dreadfully
flustered
at
the
unfortunate
turn
his
speech
had
taken
lady
who
as
i
said
will
tell
you
if
you
behave
yourselves
oh
tell
you
something
of
her
impression
of
justice
in
this
country
jean
stole
a
wondering
look
at
stonor
face
as
vida
levering
came
forward
there
she
stood
obviously
very
much
frightened
with
the
unaccustomed
colour
coming
and
going
in
her
white
face
farther
back
than
any
of
the
practised
speakers
there
she
stood
like
one
who
too
much
values
the
space
between
her
and
the
mob
voluntarily
to
lessen
it
by
half
an
inch
the
voice
was
steady
enough
though
low
as
she
began
chairman
men
and
women
up
she
flushed
came
nearer
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
raised
the
key
a
little
just
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
was
i
was
present
in
the
police
court
when
the
women
were
charged
for
creating
a
disturbance
ought
to
get
mix
up
in
wot
did
concern
you
i
she
stumbled
and
stopped
the
lady
a
hearing
said
a
shabby
magisterially
he
seemed
not
when
he
had
drawn
a
certain
number
of
eyes
to
his
long
hair
picturesque
hat
and
flowing
byronic
tie
the
lydy
nyme
ai
seen
this
one
before
she
or
miss
dumb
anyway
like
said
haw
the
anxious
chairman
was
fidgeting
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
he
whispered
some
kind
prompting
word
after
he
had
flung
out
see
here
men
fair
play
you
know
think
i
ought
vida
began
wonder
she
ca
find
a
word
to
say
for
they
a
disgryce
miss
them
women
behind
you
it
the
they
goes
on
as
mykes
the
govermint
keep
ye
from
gettin
yer
rights
the
chairman
had
lost
his
temper
the
way
go
on
he
screamed
but
the
din
was
now
so
great
not
even
he
could
be
heard
he
stood
there
waving
his
arms
and
moving
his
lips
while
his
dark
eyes
glittered
miss
levering
turned
and
pantomimed
to
ernestine
see
it
no
use
thus
appealed
to
the
girl
came
forward
and
said
something
in
the
ear
of
the
frantic
chairman
when
he
stopped
gyrating
and
nodded
miss
blunt
came
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
held
up
her
hand
as
if
determined
to
stem
this
tide
of
unfavourable
comment
upon
the
dreadful
women
who
were
complicating
the
election
difficulties
of
both
parties
says
ernestine
got
something
to
propose
they
waited
an
instant
to
hear
what
this
precious
proposal
might
be
the
government
withholds
the
vote
because
they
do
like
the
way
some
of
us
ask
for
it
let
them
give
it
to
the
quiet
ones
do
they
want
to
punish
all
women
because
they
do
like
the
manners
of
a
handful
perhaps
that
men
notion
of
justice
it
is
ours
haw
miss
levering
plucked
up
courage
seeing
her
friend
sailing
along
so
safely
is
the
first
time
i
ever
gone
on
as
you
call
it
but
they
never
gave
me
a
vote
says
miss
ernestine
with
energy
there
are
she
turned
briskly
with
forefinger
uplifted
punctuating
her
count
are
two
three
four
women
on
this
platform
now
we
all
want
the
vote
as
you
know
yes
we
know
we
agree
to
be
disfranchised
all
our
lives
if
they
give
the
vote
to
all
the
other
women
here
you
made
one
speech
give
the
lady
a
chance
miss
blunt
made
a
smiling
little
bob
of
triumph
just
what
i
wanted
you
to
say
and
she
retired
miss
levering
came
forward
again
but
the
call
to
on
had
come
a
little
suddenly
you
you
do
know
you
do
know
we
going
to
know
if
you
ca
tell
us
demanded
a
sarcastic
voice
it
steadied
her
you
for
that
she
said
smiling
have
a
better
motto
how
you
to
know
if
we
ca
somehow
manage
to
tell
you
with
a
visible
effort
she
went
on
certainly
did
know
before
that
the
sergeants
and
policemen
are
instructed
to
deceive
the
people
as
to
the
time
such
cases
are
heard
just
as
hard
said
a
bystander
to
his
companion
as
hard
for
learned
counsel
in
the
august
quiet
of
the
chancery
division
to
find
out
when
their
cases
are
really
coming
on
ask
and
you
sent
to
marlborough
police
court
said
miss
levering
of
to
marylebone
oughter
send
yer
to
do
y
good
go
on
miss
nobody
minds
can
you
expect
from
a
pig
but
a
grunt
are
told
the
case
will
be
at
two
and
it
really
called
for
eleven
well
i
took
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
i
did
believe
what
i
was
told
she
was
warming
a
little
to
her
task
almost
the
first
thing
we
have
to
learn
to
get
over
our
touching
faith
that
because
a
man
tells
us
something
it
true
i
got
to
the
right
court
and
i
was
so
anxious
not
to
be
late
i
was
too
early
a
woman
case
before
the
suffragists
was
just
coming
on
i
heard
a
noise
i
saw
the
helmets
of
two
policemen
you
did
they
do
wear
their
helmets
in
court
were
coming
in
from
the
corridor
as
i
saw
them
i
said
to
myself
what
sort
of
crime
shall
i
have
to
sit
and
hear
about
is
this
a
burglar
being
brought
along
between
the
two
big
policemen
or
will
it
be
a
murderer
what
sort
of
felon
is
to
stand
in
the
dock
before
the
people
whose
crime
is
they
ask
for
the
vote
but
try
as
i
would
i
could
see
the
prisoner
my
heart
misgave
me
is
it
some
poor
woman
i
wondered
a
tipsy
tramp
with
his
battered
bowler
over
one
eye
wheezed
out
again
with
an
accent
of
weary
philosophy
old
tyle
the
policemen
got
nearer
and
i
saw
she
waited
an
instant
little
thin
boy
what
do
you
think
he
was
charged
with
first
with
a
ticket
a
boy
offered
a
page
out
of
personal
history
what
had
he
been
stealing
that
small
criminal
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
sat
there
looking
on
that
the
men
who
had
had
the
affairs
of
the
world
in
their
hands
from
the
beginning
and
who
made
so
poor
a
business
of
it
pore
devils
give
a
rest
made
so
bad
a
business
of
it
as
to
have
the
poor
and
the
unemployed
in
the
condition
they
in
whose
only
remedy
for
a
starving
child
is
to
hale
him
off
to
the
police
court
because
he
had
managed
to
get
a
little
milk
well
i
did
wonder
that
the
men
refuse
to
be
helped
with
a
problem
they
so
notoriously
failed
at
i
began
to
say
to
myself
is
it
time
the
women
lent
a
hand
pretty
well
fur
a
dumb
lady
you
have
women
magistrates
she
was
stumped
by
the
suddenness
of
the
query
haw
magistrates
and
judges
prove
first
they
able
to
it
was
more
than
the
shabby
could
stand
schools
are
full
of
them
he
shouted
their
michael
angelo
they
study
music
by
thousands
where
their
beethoven
their
plato
where
the
woman
shakespeare
their
harry
lauder
at
last
a
name
that

her
head
wot
women
ever
the
speaker
had
clenched
her
hands
but
she
was
not
going
to
lose
her
presence
of
mind
again
by
the
time
the
chairman
could
make
himself
heard
with
men
it
one
of
our
british
characteristics
that
we
always
ready
to
give
the
people
we
differ
from

the
slightest
of
gestures
waved
him
aside
with
a
low
all
right
questions
are
quite
proper
she
said
raising
her
voice
are
often
asked
elsewhere
and
i
would
like
to
ask
in
return
since
when
was
human
society
held
to
exist
for
its
handful
of
geniuses
how
many
platos
are
there
here
in
this
crowd
a
wan
and
a
roar
of
laughter
followed
that
free
confession
one
she
repeated
that
does
keep
you
men
off
the
register
how
many
shakespeares
are
there
in
all
england
not
one
yet
the
state
does
tumble
to
pieces
railroads
and
ships
are
built
homes
are
kept
going
and
babies
are
born
the
world
goes
on
she
bent
over
the
crowd
with
lit
eyes
world
goes
on
virtue
of
its
common
there
was
a
subdued
hear
am
not
concerned
that
you
should
think
we
women
could
paint
great
pictures
or
compose
immortal
music
or
write
good
books
i
am
content
and
it
was
strange
to
see
the
pride
with
which
she
said
it
a
pride
that
might
have
humbled
vere
de
vere
am
content
that
we
should
be
classed
with
the
common
people
who
keep
the
world
going
but
her
face
grew
softer
there
was
even
a
kind
of
camaraderie
where
before
there
had
been
shrinking
like
the
world
to
go
a
great
deal
better
we
were
talking
about
justice
i
have
been
inquiring
into
the
kind
of
lodging
the
poorest
class
of
homeless
women
can
get
in
this
town
of
london
i
find
that
only
the
men
of
that
class
are
provided
for
some
measure
to
establish
rowton
houses
for
women
has
been
before
the
london
county
council
they
looked
into
the
question
very
carefully
so
their
apologists
say
and
what
did
they
decide
they
decided
that
they
could
do
nothing
could
that
great
body
do
nothing
because
they
said
if
these
cheap
and
decent
houses
were
opened
the
homeless
women
in
the
streets
would
make
use
of
them
you
think
i
not
in
earnest
but
that
was
actually
the
decision
and
the
reason
given
for
it
women
that
the
bitter
struggle
for
existence
had
forced
into
a
life
of
horror
might
take
advantage
of
the
shelter
these
decent
cheap
places
offered
but
the
i
said
are
the
men
who
avail
themselves
of
lord
hostels
are
all
angels
or
does
in
a
man
not
matter
yet
women
are
recommended
to
depend
on
the
chivalry
of
men
the
two
tall
policemen
who
had
been
standing
for
some
minutes
in
front
of
stonor
in
readiness
to
serve
him
seeming
to
feel
there
was
no
further
need
of
them
in
this
quarter
shouldered
their
way
to
the
left
leaving
exposed
the
hitherto
masked
figure
of
the
tall
gentleman
in
the
motor
cap
he
moved
uneasily
and
looking
round
he
met
jean
eyes
fixed
on
him
as
each
looked
away
again
each
saw
that
for
the
first
time
vida
levering
had
become
aware
of
his
presence
a
change
passed
over
her
face
and
her
figure
swayed
as
if
some
species
of
had
assailed
her
looking
down
from
that
perilous
high
perch
of
hers
upon
the
things
of
the
plain
while
the
people
were
asking
one
another
is
it
is
she
going
to
faint
she
lifted
one
hand
to
her
eyes
and
her
fingers
trembled
an
instant
against
the
lowered
lids
but
as
suddenly
as
she
had
faltered
she
was
forging
on
again
repeating
like
an
echo
of
a
thing
heard
in
a
dream
and
chivalry
justice
and
chivalry
remind
me
of
the
story
that
those
of
you
who
read
the
news
i
have
begun
only
lately
to
do
that
but
seen
the
accounts
of
the
girl
who
been
tried
in
manchester
lately
for
the
murder
of
her
child
people
here
and
there
in
the
crowd
regaled
one
another
with
choice
details
of
the
horror
pleasant
reading
even
if
we
noticed
it
we
would
speak
of
it
in
my
world
a
few
months
ago
i
should
have
turned
away
my
eyes
and
forgotten
even
the
headline
as
quickly
as
i
could
opinion
said
a
young
man
that
she
forgot
what
she
meant
to
say
and
just
clutched
at
this
to
keep
her
from
drying
up
that
morning
in
the
i
read
these
things
this
as
you
know
was
the
story
of
a
working
girl
an
orphan
of
seventeen
who
crawled
with
the
dead
body
of
her
child
to
her
master
back
door
and
left
the
baby
there
she
dragged
herself
a
little
way
off
and
fainted
a
few
days
later
she
found
herself
in
court
being
tried
for
the
murder
of
her
child
her
master
a
married
man
had
of
course
reported
the
find
at
his
back
door
to
the
police
and
he
had
been
summoned
to
give
evidence
the
girl
cried
out
to
him
in
the
open
court
you
are
the
father
he
could
deny
it
the
coroner
at
the
jury
request
censured
the
man
and
regretted
that
the
law
did
make
him
responsible
but
she
leaned
down
from
the
plinth
with
eyes
blazing
went
scot
free
and
that
girl
is
at
this
moment
serving
her
sentence
in
strangeways
gaol
through
the
moved
and
murmuring
crowd
jean
forced
her
way
coming
in
between
lady
john
and
stonor
who
stood
there
immovable
the
girl
strained
to
bring
her
lips
near
his
ear
do
you
dislike
her
so
he
said
should
you
think
never
saw
you
look
as
you
did
with
a
vaguely
frightened
air
she
added
you
do
make
boast
the
voice
came
clear
from
the
monument
an
english
citizen
is
tried
by
his
peers
what
woman
is
tried
by
hers
mistakes
the
sense
in
which
the
word
was
employed
said
a
man
who
looked
like
an
oxford
don
but
there
was
evidently
a
sense
larger
than
that
one
purely
academic
in
which
her
use
of
the
word
could
claim
its
pertinence
the
strong
feeling
that
had
seized
her
as
she
put
the
question
was
sweeping
the
crowd
along
with
her
woman
is
arrested
by
a
man
brought
before
a
man
judge
tried
by
a
jury
of
men
condemned
by
men
taken
to
prison
by
a
man
and
by
a
man
she
hanged
where
in
all
this
were
peers
why
did
men
when
british
justice
was
born
why
did
they
so
long
ago
insist
on
trial
by
a
jury
of
their
peers
so
that
justice
should
miscarry
was
it
a
man
peers
would
best
understand
his
circumstances
his
temptation
the
degree
of
his
guilt
yet
there
no
such
unlikeness
between
different
classes
of
men
as
exists
between
man
and
woman
what
man
has
the
knowledge
that
makes
him
a
fit
judge
of
woman
deeds
at
that
time
of
anguish
that
hour
that
some
woman
struggled
through
to
put
each
man
here
into
the
world
i
noticed
when
a
previous
speaker
quoted
the
labour
party
you
applauded
some
of
you
here
i
gather
call
yourselves
labour
men
every
woman
who
has
borne
a
child
is
a
labour
woman
no
man
among
you
can
judge
what
she
goes
through
in
her
hour
of
darkness
jean
eyes
had
dropped
from
her
lover
set
white
face
early
in
the
recital
but
she
whispered
his
name
he
seemed
not
to
hear
the
speaker
up
there
had
caught
her
fluttering
breath
and
went
on
so
low
that
people
strained
to
follow
that
great
agony
even
under
the
best
conditions
that
money
and
devotion
can
buy
many
a
woman
falls
into
temporary
mania
and
not
a
few
go
down
to
death
in
the
case
of
this
poor
little
abandoned
working
girl
what
man
can
be
the
fit
judge
of
her
deeds
in
that
awful
moment
of
temptation
women
know
of
these
things
as
those
know
burning
who
have
walked
through
fire
stonor
looked
down
at
the
girl
at
his
side
he
saw
her
hands
go
up
to
her
throat
as
though
she
were
suffocating
the
young
face
where
some
harsh
knowledge
was
struggling
for
birth
was
in
pity
turned
away
from
the
man
she
loved
the
woman
leaned
down
from
the
platform
and
spoke
her
last
words
with
a
low
and
thrilling
earnestness
would
say
in
conclusion
to
the
women
here
it
not
enough
to
be
sorry
for
these
our
unfortunate
sisters
we
must
get
the
conditions
of
life
made
fairer
we
women
must
organize
we
must
learn
to
work
together
we
have
all
rich
and
poor
happy
and
unhappy
worked
so
long
and
so
exclusively
for
men
we
hardly
know
how
to
work
for
one
another
but
we
must
learn
those
who
can
may
give
money
those
who
pennies
to
give
even
those
people
are
not
so
poor
but
what
they
can
give
some
part
of
their
labour
some
share
of
their
sympathy
and
support
i
know
of
a
woman
she
is
of
our
country
but
a
woman
who
to
help
the
women
strikers
of
an
oppressed
industry
to
hold
out
gave
a
thousand
pounds
a
week
for
thirteen
weeks
to
get
them
and
their
children
bread
and
help
them
to
stand
firm
the
masters
were
amazed
week
after
week
went
by
and
still
the
people
were
starved
into
submission
where
did
this
mysterious
stream
of
help
come
from
the
employers
could
discover
and
they
gave
in
the
women
got
back
their
old
wages
and
i
am
glad
to
say
many
of
them
began
to
put
by
pennies
to
help
a
little
to
pay
back
the
great
sum
that
had
been
advanced
to
them
took
their
pennies
a
rich
woman
like
that
to
use
again
as
well
as
to
let
the
working
women
feel
they
were
helping
others
i
hope
you
all
join
the
union
come
up
after
the
meeting
is
over
and
give
us
your
names
as
she
turned
away
wo
get
any
men
a
taunting
voice
called
after
her
the
truth
in
the
gibe
seemed
to
sting
forestalling
the
chairman
quickly
she
confronted
the
people
again
a
new
fire
in
her
eyes
she
said
holding
out
her
hands
is
to
the
women
i
she
stood
so
an
instant
stilling
the
murmur
and
holding
the
people
by
that
sudden
concentration
of
passion
in
her
face
mean
to
say
it
would
be
better
if
men
and
women
did
this
work
together
shoulder
to
shoulder
but
the
mass
of
men
wo
have
it
so
i
only
hope
they
realize
in
time
the
good
they
renounced
and
the
spirit
they
aroused
for
i
know
as
well
as
any
man
could
tell
me
it
would
be
a
bad
day
for
england
if
all
women
felt
about
all
men
i
she
retired
in
a
tumult
the
others
on
the
platform
closed
about
her
the
chairman
tried
in
vain
to
get
a
hearing
from
the
swaying
and
dissolving
crowd
jean
made
a
blind
forward
movement
towards
the
monument
stonor
called
out
in
a
toneless
voice
follow
me
no
i
the
girl
pressed
on
going
the
wrong
way
is
the
way
can
get
out
quicker
on
this
side

to
get
out
he
had
left
lady
john
and
was
following
jean
through

press
are
you
going
he
asked
sharply
ask
that
woman
to
let
me
have
the
honour
of
working
with
her
the
crowd
surged
round
the
girl
he
called
upon
so
stern
a
note
that

stared
and
stopped

chapter
xvii
a
little
before
six
on
that
same
sunday
jean
dunbarton
opened
the
communicating
door
between
her
own
little
and
the
big
bare
of
her
grandfather
house
in
eaton
square
she
stood
a
moment
on
the
threshold
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
and
then
crossed
the
treading
softly
on
the
parquet
spaces
between
the
rugs
she
went
straight
to
the
window
and
was
in
the
act
of
parting
the
lace
curtains
to
look
out
when
she
heard
the
folding
doors
open
with
raised
finger
she
turned
to
say
the
servant
stood
silently
waiting
while
she
went
back
to
the
door
she
had
left
open
and
with
an
air
of
caution
closed
it
when
she
turned
round
again
the
butler
had
stepped
aside
to
admit
stonor
he
came
in
with
a
quick
impatient
step
but
before
he
had
time
to
get
a
word
out
low
please
the
girl
said
he
was
obviously
too
much
annoyed
to
pay
much
heed
to
her
request
which
if
he
thought
about
it
at
all
he
must
have
interpreted
as
consideration
for
the
ailing
grandfather
waited
a
full
for
you
to
come
back
he
said
in
a
tone
no
lower
than
usual
the
girl
had
led
the
way
to
the
side
of
the
room
furthest
from
the
communicating
door
am
sorry
she
said
dully
you
did
mind
leaving
me
like
that
he
followed
her
up
with
his
arraignment
might
at
least
have
considered
lady
john
she
here
with
you
jean
stopped
by
the
sofa
near
the
window
he
said
curtly
place
was
nearer
than
this
and
she
was
tired
i
left
her
to
get
some
tea
we
could
tell
whether
you
be
here
or
had
become
of
you

got
us
a
hansom
chairman
of
the
meeting

levering
and
me
stonor
incensed
face
turned
almost
brick
colour
as
he
repeated
before
he
got
the
name
out
the
folding
doors
had
opened
again
and
the
butler
was
saying
farnborough
that
young
gentleman
was
far
too
anxious
and
flurried
himself
to
have
sufficient
detachment
of
mind
to
consider
the
moods
of
other
people
last
he
said
stopping
short
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
stonor
speak
loud
please
said
miss
dunbarton
one
is
resting
in
the
next
room
did
you
find
your
grandfather
worse
but
he
never
waited
to
learn
forgive
the
incursion
when
you
hear
he
turned
abruptly
to
stonor
again
been
telegraphing
you
all
over
london
he
said
putting
his
hat
down
in
the
nearest
chair
sheer
despair
they
set
me
on
your
track
did
farnborough
was
fumbling
agitatedly
in
his
was
the
devil
to
pay
at
dutfield
last
night
the
liberal
chap
tore
down
from
london
and
took
over
your
meeting
nothing
about
it
in
the
sunday
paper
i
saw
till
you
see
the
press
there
was
a
great
rally
and
the
beggar
made
a
rousing
speech
about
of
the
upper
house
were
at
that
when
i
was
at
eton
stonor
turned
on
his
heel
but
this
man
has
got
a
way
of
putting
things
the
people
went
mad
it
was
all
very
well
for
a
mere
girl
to
be
staring
indifferently
out
of
the
window
while
a
great
historic
party
was
steering
straight
for
shipwreck
but
it
really
was
too
much
to
see
this
man
who
ought
to
be
taking
the
situation
with
the
seriousness
it
deserved
strolling
about
the
room
with
that
abstracted
air
looking
superciliously
at
dunbarton
examples
of
the
glasgow
school
farnborough
balanced
himself
on
legs
and
thrust
one
hand
in
his
trousers
pocket
the
other
hand
held
a
telegram
liberal
platform
as
defined
at
dutfield
is
going
to
make
a
big
difference
he
pronounced
think
so
said
stonor
dryly
your
agent
says
as
much
he
pulled
off
the
envelope
threw
it
and
the
form
on
the
table
and
held
the
message
under
the
eyes
of
the
obviously
surprised
gentleman
in
front
of
him
agent
stonor
had
echoed
with
faint
incredulity
he
took
the
telegram
try
find
stonor
he
read
h
his
eyes
ran
on
farnborough
looked
first
at
the
expressionless
face
and
then
at
the
message
see
he
glanced
over
stonor
shoulder
tremendous
effect
of
last
night
liberal
manifesto
ought
to
be
counteracted
in
papers
then
withdrawing
a
couple
of
paces
he
said
very
earnestly
see
stonor
it
a
we
want
said
the
great
man
throwing
the
telegram
down
on
the
table
said
farnborough
distinctly
dashed
been
saying
we
have
nothing
to
offer
but
personal
popularity
no
practical
reform
no
truckling
to
the
masses
i
suppose
poor
farnborough
bit
his
lip
in
these
democratic
days
obliged
i
should
to
consider
in
his
baulked
and
snubbed
condition
he
turned
to
miss
dunbarton
for
countenance
hope
forgive
my
bursting
in
like
this
but
he
gathered
courage
as
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
averted
face
can
see
you
realize
the
gravity
of
the
situation
he
found
her
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
and
went
on
with
an
air
of
speaking
for
her
ear
alone
excuse
for
being
so
officious
you
see
it
is
as
if
he
were
going
to
be
a
mere
private
member
everybody
knows
he
be
in
the
cabinet
may
be
a
liberal
cabinet
came
from
stonor
at
his
dryest
farnborough
leapt
back
into
the
fray
thought
so
up
to
last
night
why
even
your
brother
he
brought
up
short
i
afraid
i
really
seeming
rather
he
took
up
his
hat
about
my
brother
only
that
i
went
from
your
house
to
the
club
you
know
and
i
met
lord
windlesham
as
i
rushed
up
the
carlton
steps
told
him
the
dutfield
news
stonor
turned
sharply
round
his
face
was
much
more
interested
than
any
of
his
words
had
been
as
though
in
the
silence
stonor
had
asked
a
question
farnborough
produced
the
answer
brother
said
it
only
confirmed
his
fears
that
did
he
stonor
spoke
half
under
his
breath
defeat
is
inevitable
he
thinks
unless
farnborough
waited
intently
watching
the
big
figure
that
had
begun
pacing
back
and
forth
it
paused
but
no
word
came
even
the
eyes
were
not
raised
farnborough
went
on
can
manufacture
some
political
dynamite
within
the
next
few
hours
those
were
his
words
as
stonor
resumed
his
walk
he
raised
his
head
and
caught
sight
of
face
he
stopped
short
directly
in
front
of
her
are
very
tired
he
said
no
she
turned
again
to
the
window
obliged
to
you
for
troubling
about
this
he
said
offering
farnborough
his
hand
with
the
air
of
civilly
dismissing
him
see
what
can
be
done
farnborough
caught
up
the
form
from
the
table
you
like
to
wire
i
take
it
faintly
amused
at
this
summary
view
of
large
complexities
understand
my
young
friend
he
said
not
unkindly
of
this
sort
are
not
rushed
at
by
responsible
politicians
i
must
have
time
for
consideration
farnborough
face
fell
well
i
only
hope
some
one
else
wo
jump
into
the
breach
before
you
with
his
watch
in
one
hand
he
held
out
the
other
to
miss
dunbarton
i
just
go
and
find
out
what
time
the
newspapers
go
to
press
on
sunday
i
be
at
the
club
he
threw
over
his
shoulder
in
case
i
can
be
of
any
use
do
do
that
if
i
should
have
anything
new
to
say
with
our
party
as
your
brother
said
heading
straight
for
a
vast
electoral
disaster
and
the
liberals
i
decide
on
a
i
shall
simply
telegraph
to
headquarters
a
a
with
a
gesture
of
country
going
to
the
dogs
farnborough
opened
the
doors
and
closed
them
behind
him
jean
had
rung
the
bell
she
came
back
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
and
paused
near
the
table
where
the
crumpled
envelope
made
a
dash
of
on
the
polished
satinwood
stonor
stood
studying
the
carpet
more
concern
in
his
face
now
that
there
was
only
jean
to
see
it
political
dynamite
eh
he
repeated
walking
a
few
paces
away
he
returned
with
all
women
are
much
more
conservative
than
men
are
they
jean
lowered
eyes
showed
no
spark
of
interest
in
the
issue
her
only
motion
an
occasional
locking
and
unlocking
of
her
fingers
but
no
words
came
he
glanced
at
her
as
if
for
the
first
time
conscious
of
her
silence
see
now
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
reason
why
encouraged
you
to
take
an
interest
in
public
questions
because
people
like
us
do
go
screaming
about
it
is
no
sign
we
do
some
of
us
see
what
on
the
way
however
little
they
may
want
to
women
of
our
class
will
have
to
come
into
line
all
the
best
things
in
the
world
everything
civilization
has
won
will
be
in
danger
if
when
this
change
comes
the
only
women
who
have
practical
political
training
are
the
women
of
the
lower
classes
women
of
the
lower
classes
he
repeated
the
line
between
his
eyebrows
deepening
inoculated
by
the
socialist
virus
he
was
in
no
mood
to
discuss
a
concrete
type
to
so
intelligent
a
girl
a
hint
should
be
enough
he
drew
the
that
still
lay
on
the
table
towards
him
us
see
how
it
would
sound
shall
we
he
detached
a
gold
pencil
from
one
end
of
his
and
with
face
more
and
more
intent
bent
over
the
paper
writing
the
girl
opened
her
lips
more
than
once
to
speak
and
each
time
fell
back
again
on
her
silent
misery
when
stonor
finished
writing
he
held
the
paper
off
smiling
a
little
with
the
craftsman
satisfaction
in
his
work
and
more
than
a
touch
of
shrewd
malice
dynamite
in
that
he
commented
too
much
is
there
little
girl
i
know
her
story
he
looked
at
her
for
the
first
time
since
farnborough
left
the
room
story
levering
he
crushed
the
rough
note
of
his
manifesto
into
his
pocket
levering
he
stared
at
the
girl
till
across
the
moment
silence
a
cry
of
misery
went
out
did
you
desert
her
he
said
like
one
staggered
by
the
sheer
wildness
of
the
charge
but
no
comfort
of
doubting
seemed
to
cross
the
darkness
of
backward
look
into
the
past
why
did
you
do
it
in
the
name
of
what
has
she
been
saying
to
you
one
else
told
me
part
then
the
way
you
looked
when
you
saw
her
at
aunt
ellen
miss
levering
saying
you
did
know
her
then
your
letting
out
that
you
knew
even
the
curious
name
on
the
handkerchief
oh
i
pieced
it
together
while
she
poured
out
the
disjointed
sentences
he
had
recovered
his
ingenuity
is
undeniable
he
said
coldly
rising
to
his
feet
but
he
paused
as
the
girl
went
on
then
when
she
said
that
at
the
meeting
about
the
dark
hour
and
i
looked
at
her
face
it
flashed
over
me
oh
why
did
you
desert
her
it
was
as
if
the
iteration
of
that
charge
stung
him
out
of
his
chill
anger
desert
her
he
said
her
hands
went
fluttering
up
to
her
eyes
and
hid
the
quivering
face
something
in
the
action
touched
him
his
face
changed
and
he
made
a
sudden
passionate
movement
toward
the
trembling
figure
standing
there
with
hidden
eyes
in
another
moment
his
arms
would
have
been
round
her
her
muffled
voice
saying
glad
i
glad
checked
him
he
stood
bewildered
making
with
noiseless
lips
the
word
she
was
he
had
tired
of
her
rival
the
girl
brushed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
steadied
herself
against
the
table
went
away
from
you
then
the
momentary
softening
had
vanished
out
of
geoffrey
stonor
face
in
its
stead
the
look
of
aloofness
that
few
dared
brave
the
warning
far
and
no
farther
stamped
on
every
feature
he
answered
can
hardly
expect
me
to
enter
into
she
broke
through
the
barrier
without
ruth
such
strength
such
courage
has
honest
pain
mean
she
went
away
from
you
the
sharp
monosyllable
fell
out
like
a
thing
metallic
that
because
you
would
marry
her
could
marry
her
and
she
knew
it
he
turned
on
his
heel
you
want
to
he
paused
nearly
at
the
window
and
looked
back
at
her
she
deserved
to
have
the
bare
but
she
was
a
child
he
would
soften
a
little
the
truth
harsh
impact
upon
the
young
creature
shrinking
jealousy
thought
i
wanted
to
marry
her
then
it
a
long
time
ago
why
could
you
he
controlled
a
movement
of
strong
irritation
are
you
catechizing
me
it
a
matter
that
concerns
another
woman
you
say
it
does
concern
me
you
saying
her
lip
trembled
that
you
do
concern
me
with
more
difficulty
than
the
girl
dreamed
he
compelled
himself
to
answer
quietly
those
days
i
i
was
absolutely
dependent
on
my
father
you
must
have
been
thirty
geoffrey
oh
thereabouts
everybody
says
you
so
clever
everybody
mistaken
she
left
the
table
and
drew
nearer
to
him
must
have
been
terribly
hard
sounding
the
depth
of
sympathy
in
the
gentle
voice
he
turned
towards
her
to
meet
a
check
in
the
phrase
terribly
hard
for
you
both
he
stood
there
stonily
but
looking
rather
handsome
in
his
big
sulky
way
the
sort
of
person
who
dictates
terms
rather
than
one
to
accept
meekly
the
thing
that
might
befall
something
of
that
overbearing
look
of
his
must
have
penetrated
the
clouded
consciousness
of
the
girl
for
she
was
saying
a
man
like
not
to
have
had
the
freedom
that
even
the
lowest
seem
to
have
marry
the
woman
they
choose
did
break
off
our
relations
because
i
could
marry
her
was
it
then
too
young
to
discuss
such
a
story
he
turned
away
not
so
young
said
the
shaking
voice
she
was
when
well
then
if
you
will
have
it
his
look
was
ill
to
meet
for
any
one
who
loved
him
truth
is
it
did
weigh
upon
her
as
it
seems
to
on
you
that
i
was
able
to
marry
her
are
you
so
sure
of
that
she
did
so
much
as
hint
at
it
when
she
wrote
that
she
meant
to
break
off
the
the
made
her
write
like
that
you
go
on
talking
of
what
so
long
over
and
ended
reason
did
she
give
your
curiosity
has
so
got
the
upper
hand
her
eyes
were
upon
him
in
a
whisper
afraid
to
tell
me
she
said
he
went
over
to
the
window
seeming
to
wait
there
for
something
that
did
not
come
he
turned
round
at
last
still
hoped
at
time
to
win
my
father
over
she
blamed
me
because
again
he
faced
the
window
and
looked
blindly
out
the
child
had
lived
it
would
have
been
possible
to
get
my
father
to
to
overlook
it
wanted
it
the
girl
said
faintly
underst
he
came
back
to
her
on
a
wave
of
passion
course
you
understand
if
you
did
you
would
be
the
beautiful
tender
innocent
child
you
are
he
took
her
hand
and
tried
to
draw
her
to
him
she
withdrew
her
hand
and
shrank
from
him
with
a
movement
slight
as
it
was
so
tragically
eloquent
that
fear
for
the
first
time
caught
hold
of
him
am
glad
you
did
mean
to
desert
her
geoffrey
it
was
your
fault
after
all
only
some
misunderstanding
that
can
be
cleared
up
up
cleared
up
are
thinking
that
this
miserable
old
affair
i
as
good
as
forgotten
he
did
not
see
the
glance
at
the
door
but
he
heard
the
whisper
no
he
caught
himself
up
do
mean
exactly
forgotten
but
you
torturing
me
so
that
i
do
know
what
i
saying
he
went
closer
are
going
to
let
this
old
thing
come
between
you
and
me
she
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
and
then
took
it
away
ca
make
or
unmake
the
past
she
said
steadily
i
glad
at
least
that
you
did
mean
to
desert
her
in
her
trouble
you
remind
her
of
that
first
of
all
wo
you
she
was
moving
across
the
room
as
she
spoke
and
when
she
had
ended
the
handkerchief
went
quickly
to
her
lips
again
as
if
to
shut
the
door
on
sobbing
are
you
going
he
raised
his
voice
should
i
remind
of
what
i
want
only
to
forget
oh
hush
a
moment
she
looked
back
holding
up
praying
hands
his
eyes
had
flown
to
the
door
do
mean
i
left
her
to
get
a
little
rest
he
recoiled
in
an
access
of
uncontrollable
anger
she
followed
him
speechless
he
eluded
her
and
went
for
his
hat
she
cried
go
before
you
hear
me
i
do
know
if
what
i
think
matters
to
you
now
but
i
hope
it
does
you
can
still
her
voice
was
faint
with
tears
make
me
think
of
you
without
shrinking
if
you
will
he
fixed
her
for
a
moment
with
eyes
more
stern
than
she
had
ever
seen
is
it
you
are
asking
of
me
he
said
make
amends
geoffrey
his
anger
went
out
on
a
wave
of
pity
poor
little
innocent
poor
enough
but
she
locked
her
hands
together
like
one
who
summons
all
her
resolution
not
so
innocent
but
what
i
know
you
must
right
that
old
wrong
now
if
you
ever
to
right
it
are
insane
enough
to
think
i
would
turn
round
in
these
few
hours
and
go
back
to
something
that
ten
years
ago
was
ended
forever
as
he
saw
how
unmoved
her
face
was
he
burst
out
stark
staring
madness
she
caught
his
arm
you
did
ten
years
ago
that
was
mad
this
is
paying
a
debt
any
man
looking
on
or
hearing
of
stonor
dilemma
would
have
said
the
girl
alone
to
come
to
her
senses
but
only
a
stupid
man
would
himself
have
done
it
stonor
caught
her
two
hands
in
his
and
drew
her
into
his
arms
here
jeannie
you
dreadfully
wrought
up
and
excited
tired
too
she
freed
herself
and
averted
the
face
tired
though
i
travelled
far
i
know
you
smile
at
sudden
conversions
you
think
they
hysterical
worse
vulgar
but
people
must
get
their
revelation
how
they
can
and
geoffrey
if
i
ca
make
you
see
this
one
of
mine
i
shall
know
your
love
could
never
mean
strength
to
me
only
weakness
and
i
shall
be
afraid
she
whispered
her
dilated
eyes
might
have
seen
a
ghost
lurking
there
in
the
commonplace
room
afraid
i
should
never
dare
give
you
the
chance
of
making
me
loathe
myself
there
was
a
pause
and
out
of
the
silence
fell
words
that
were
like
the
taking
of
a
vow
would
never
see
you
again
right
i
was
to
be
afraid
of
that
vein
of
fanaticism
in
you
you
could
make
a
greater
mistake
than
to
go
away
now
and
think
it
any
good
ever
to
come
back
even
if
i
came
to
feel
different
i
could
anything
different
i
should
all
this
could
be
forgotten
i
should
know
that
it
would
poison
my
life
in
the
end
yours
too
has
made
good
use
of
her
time
he
said
bitterly
then
upon
a
sudden
thought
has
changed
has
she
been
seeing
visions
too
do
you
mean
is
she
intriguing
to
get
hold
of
a
man
that
ten
years
ago
she
flatly
refused
to
see
or
hold
any
communication
with
to
get
hold
of
she
has
mentioned
you
then
how
in
the
name
of
heaven
do
you
know
she
wants
what
you
ask
ca
be
any
doubt
about
that
said
the
girl
firmly
with
all
his
tenderness
for
her
so
little
still
did
he
understand
what
she
was
going
through
that
he
plainly
thought
all
her
pain
had
come
of
knowing
that
this
other
page
was
in
his
life
he
had
no
glimpse
of
the
girl
passionate
need
to
think
of
that
same
page
as
unmarred
by
the
darker
blot
absurd
ridiculous
child
with
immense
relief
he
dropped
into
the
nearest
chair
all
this
is
just
your
own
unaided
invention
well
i
could
thank
god
he
passed
his
handkerchief
over
his
face
what
are
you
thanking
god
he
sat
there
obviously
thinking
out
his
plan
of
action
i
not
going
to
risk
it
but
he
looked
up
and
at
the
sight
of
jean
face
he
rose
with
an
expression
strangely
gentle
the
rather
hard
eyes
were
softened
in
a
sudden
mist
deserve
to
suffer
or
not
it
quite
certain
do
do
cry
dear
one
it
never
was
the
real
thing
i
had
to
wait
till
i
knew
you
before
i
understood
her
own
eyes
were
brimming
as
she
lifted
them
in
a
passion
of
gratitude
to
his
face
is
that
true
loving
you
has
made
things
clear
to
me
i
did
dream
of
before
if
i
could
think
that
because
of
me
you
were
able
to
do
this
go
back
to
that
he
seized
her
by
the
shoulders
and
said
hoarsely
here
do
you
seriously
ask
me
to
give
up
the
girl
i
love
to
go
and
offer
to
marry
a
woman
that
even
to
think
of
cared
for
her
once
she
cried
care
about
her
again
she
is
beautiful
and
brilliant
i
heard
she
could
win
any
man
he
pushed
the
girl
from
him
bewitched
you
he
was
halfway
to
the
door
geoffrey
you
are
going
away
like
that
this
is
the
face
he
turned
back
upon
her
was
dark
and
hesitating
suppose
if
she
refused
me
you
wo
refuse
you
did
once
did
refuse
to
marry
you
as
she
passed
him
on
the
way
to
her
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
he
said
glancing
about
like
one
hunting
desperately
for
a
means
of
gaining
a
few
minutes
john
is
waiting
all
this
time
at
my
house
for
the
car
to
go
back
with
a
message
not
a
matter
of
life
and
death
she
said
with
all
the
impatience
of
the
young
at
that
tyranny
of
little
things
which
seems
to
hold
its
unrelenting
sway
though
the
battlements
of
righteousness
are
rocking
and
the
tall
towers
of
love
are
shaken
to
the
nethermost
it
not
a
matter
of
life
and
death
stonor
said
quietly
the
same
i
go
down
and
give
the
order
well
of
her
own
accord
this
time
she
stopped
on
her
way
to
that
other
door
behind
which
was
the
past
and
the
future
incarnate
in
one
woman
wait
said
jean
she
went
to
the
table
sitting
there
with
her
face
turned
from
him
she
said
quite
low
come
back
if
you
the
man
i
pray
you
are
her
seemed
all
at
once
to
fail
she
leaned
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
broke
into
a
flood
of
silent
tears
with
face
hidden
in
her
hands
he
came
swiftly
back
and
bent
over
her
a
moved
adoring
face
of
all
the
world
he
began
in
that
beautiful
voice
of
his
his
arms
were
closing
round
her
when
the
door
on
the
left
was
softly
opened
vida
levering
stood
on
the
threshold
chapter
xviii
she
drew
back
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
but
stonor
had
looked
round
his
face
darkened
as
he
stood
there
an
instant
silently
challenging
her
not
a
word
spoken
by
either
of
them
no
sound
but
the
faint
muffled
sobbing
of
the
girl
who
sat
with
hidden
face
with
a
look
of
speechless
anger
the
man
went
out
and
shut
the
doors
behind
him
not
seeing
only
hearing
that
he
had
gone
jean
threw
her
arms
out
across
the
table
in
an
abandonment
of
grief
the
other
woman
laid
on
a
chair
the
hat
and
cloak
that
she
was
carrying
then
she
went
slowly
across
the
room
and
stood
silent
a
moment
at
jean
side
is
the
matter
the
girl
started
impossible
for
her
to
speak
in
that
first
moment
but
when
she
had
dried
her
eyes
she
said
with
a
pathetic
childish
air
i
been
seeing
geoffrey
this
the
effect
seeing
geoffrey
has
said
the
other
with
an
attempt
at
lightness
see
i
know
now
jean
explained
with
the
brave
directness
that
was
characteristic
the
more
sophisticated
woman
presented
an
aspect
totally
unenlightened
know
how
he
jean
dropped
her
eyes
he
spoiled
some
one
life
tells
you
that
asked
miss
levering
people
have
told
me
you
should
be
very
careful
how
you
believe
what
you
hear
know
it
true
said
the
girl
passionately
know
that
it
possible
to
be
mistaken
see
you
trying
to
shield
him
should
i
what
is
it
to
me
how
you
must
love
him
she
said
with
tears
listen
to
me
said
vida
gravely
as
she
drew
up
a
chair
the
girl
rose
to
her
feet
the
use
what
the
use
of
your
going
on
denying
it
as
she
saw
vida
was
about
to
break
in
she
silenced
her
with
two
words
and
with
that
she
fled
away
to
the
window
vida
half
rose
and
then
relinquished
the
idea
of
following
the
girl
seemed
presently
to
forget
her
and
sat
as
one
alone
with
sorrow
when
jean
had
mastered
herself
she
came
slowly
back
not
till
she
was
close
to
the
motionless
figure
did
the
girl
lift
her
eyes
do
look
like
that
the
girl
prayed
shall
bring
him
back
to
you
she
was
on
her
knees
by
vida
chair
the
fixed
abstraction
went
out
of
the
older
face
but
it
was
very
cold
as
she
began
would
be
impertinent
if
you
were
a
romantic
child
you
bring
him
back
yes
he
but
vida
looked
deep
into
the
candid
eyes
is
something
you
do
him
to
a
point
where
he
recognizes
that
he
is
in
our
debt
debt
vida
nodded
debt
to
women
he
ca
repay
the
one
he
robbed
jean
winced
at
that
the
young
do
not
know
that
nothing
but
money
can
ever
be
paid
back
she
insisted
out
of
the
faith
she
still
had
in
him
ready
to
be
his
surety
he
can
he
will
the
other
shook
her
head
he
ca
repay
the
dead
but
there
are
the
living
there
are
the
thousands
with
hope
still
in
their
hearts
and
youth
in
their
blood
let
him
help
let
him
be
a
friend
to
women
understand
jean
rose
up
too
the
door
had
opened
and
lady
john
was
coming
in
with
stonor
towering
beside
her
when
he
saw
the
girl
rising
from
her
knees
he
turned
to
lady
john
with
a
little
gesture
of
did
i
tell
you
the
moment
jean
caught
sight
of
him
you
she
said
while
her
aunt
was
briskly
advancing
filling
all
the
room
with
a
pleasant
silken
rustling
and
a
something
nameless
that
was
like
clear
noonday
after
or
haunted
twilight
she
said
in
a
cheerful
commonplace
tone
to
jean
rather
gave
us
the
slip
vida
i
believe
stonor
wants
to
see
you
for
a
few
minutes
but
she
glanced
at
her
watch
like
a
word
with
you
first
as
i
must
get
back
do
you
think
the
car
she
turned
to
stonor
man
said
something
about
recharging
did
he
i
see
about
it
as
he
went
out
he
brushed
past
the
butler
trent
has
called
miss
to
take
the
lady
to
the
meeting
said
that
functionary
trent
into
my
said
jean
hastily
and
then
to
miss
levering
tell
him
you
ca
go
lady
john
stood
watching
the
girl
with
critical
eyes
till
she
had
disappeared
into
the
adjoining
room
and
shut
the
door
behind
her
then
know
my
dear
she
spoke
almost
apologetically
not
aware
of
what
that
impulsive
child
wants
to
insist
on
i
feel
it
an
embarrassment
even
to
tell
you
know
know
lady
john
waited
for
condemnation
of
jean
idea
she
waited
in
vain
is
with
your
sanction
surely
that
she
makes
this
extraordinary
demand
did
sanction
it
at
first
said
the
other
slowly
i
been
thinking
it
over
lady
john
suavity
stiffened
perceptibly
all
i
can
say
is
i
am
greatly
disappointed
in
you
you
threw
this
man
over
years
ago
for
reasons
whatever
they
were
that
seemed
to
you
good
and
sufficient
and
now
you
come
in
between
him
and
a
younger
woman
just
to
play
nemesis
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
that
what
he
says
says
nothing
that
is
fair
and
considerate
can
see
he
changed
you
unchanged
is
that
it
changed
even
more
than
he
lady
john
sat
down
with
pity
and
annoyance
struggling
for
the
mastery
care
about
him
still
and
yet
you
i
see
there
are
obviously
certain
things
he
can
give
his
wife
and
you
naturally
want
to
marry
somebody
lady
john
said
vida
wearily
are
no
men
listening
she
looked
round
surprised
did
suppose
there
were
why
keep
up
that
old
pretence
pret
to
marry
all
is
every
woman
dearest
ambition
till
the
grave
closes
over
her
you
and
i
it
is
true
but
her
ladyship
blinked
suddenly
seeing
daylight
it
was
just
the
unexpected
sight
of
him
bringing
it
all
back
was
what
fired
you
this
afternoon
of
course
she
made
an
honest
attempt
at
sympathetic
understanding
memory
of
a
thing
like
that
can
never
die
can
never
even
be
dimmed
for
the
woman
mean
her
to
think
so
vida
nodded
it
is
so
lady
john
was
a
little
bewildered
do
seriously
believe
said
vida
a
woman
with
anything
else
to
think
about
comes
to
the
end
of
ten
years
still
absorbed
in
a
memory
of
that
sort
lady
john
stared
speechless
a
moment
got
over
it
then
it
were
for
the
papers
i
should
remember
twice
a
year
there
was
ever
such
a
person
as
geoffrey
stonor
in
the
world
i
glad
said
lady
john
with
unconscious
rapture
vida
smiled
grimly
i
glad
too
if
geoffrey
stonor
offered
you
er
reparation
you
refuse
it
stonor
for
me
he
simply
one
of
the
far
back
links
in
a
chain
of
evidence
it
certain
i
think
a
hundred
times
of
other
present
unhappiness
to
once
that
i
remember
that
old
unhappiness
of
mine
that
past
i
think
of
the
nail
and
chain
makers
of
cradley
heath
the
sweated
girls
of
the
slums
i
think
her
voice
fell
the
army
of
women
whose
very
existence
i
must
mention
lady
john
interrupted
her
hurriedly
why
in
heaven
name
do
you
let
poor
jean
imagine
vida
suddenly
bent
forward
i
trust
you
lady
john
i
suffer
from
that
old
wrong
as
jean
thinks
i
do
but
i
shall
coin
her
sympathy
into
gold
for
a
greater
cause
than
mine
do
understand
you
is
old
enough
to
be
able
to
care
as
much
about
a
principle
as
about
a
person
but
if
my
old
pain
can
turn
her
generosity
into
the
common
treasury
do
you
propose
she
shall
do
poor
child
her
hold
over
geoffrey
stonor
to
make
him
help
us
help
you
man
who
served
one
woman
god
knows
how
many
more
very
ill
shall
serve
hundreds
of
thousands
well
geoffrey
stonor
shall
make
it
harder
for
his
son
harder
still
for
his
grandson
to
treat
any
woman
as
he
treated
me
will
he
do
that
said
the
lady
coldly
putting
an
end
to
the
helplessness
of
women
must
think
he
has
a
great
deal
of
power
said
her
ladyship
with
some
irony
yes
answered
the
other
have
too
much
over
penniless
and
frightened
women
nonsense
you
talk
as
though
the
women
had
their
share
of
human
nature
are
made
of
ice
any
more
than
the
men
but
we
have
more
men
vida
had
risen
she
looked
down
at
her
friend
know
we
have
she
said
know
said
lady
john
shrewdly
must
admit
it
fear
they
call
us
fishes
lady
john
had
been
frankly
shocked
at
the
previous
plain
speaking
but
she
found
herself
stimulated
to
show
in
this
moment
of
privacy
that
even
she
had
not
travelled
her
sheltered
way
through
the
world
altogether
in
blinkers
talk
of
our
lack
of
but
she
admitted
the
last
thing
men
women
to
have
we
know
what
they
want
us
to
have
so
we
make
shift
to
have
it
if
we
do
we
go
without
hope
sometimes
we
go
without
bread
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
mean
to
say
that
men
vanity
wo
let
them
see
it
but
the
largely
a
question
of
economics
loved
him
then
i
loved
him
once
it
was
my
helplessness
that
turned
the
best
thing
life
can
bring
into
a
curse
for
both
of
us
do
understand
you
being
understood
that
too
much
to
expect
i
make
myself
no
illusions
when
people
come
to
know
that
i
joined
the
union
you
who
is
there
who
will
resist
the
temptation
to
say
poor
vida
levering
what
a
pity
she
has
got
a
husband
and
a
baby
to
keep
her
quiet
the
few
who
know
about
me
they
be
equally
sure
that
not
the
larger
view
of
life
i
gained
but
my
own
poor
little
story
is
responsible
for
my
new
departure
she
leaned
forward
and
looked
into
lady
john
face
best
friend
she
will
be
surest
of
all
that
a
private
sense
of
loss
or
lower
yet
a
grudge
that
responsible
for
my
attitude
i
tell
you
the
only
difference
between
me
and
thousands
of
women
with
husbands
and
babies
is
that
i
am
free
to
say
what
i
think
are
lady
john
opened
her
lips
and
then
closed
them
firmly
after
all
why
pursue
the
matter
she
had
got
the
information
she
had
come
for
must
hurry
back
she
rose
murmuring
poor
guests
vida
stood
there
quiet
a
little
cold
wo
ring
she
said
think
you
find
stonor
downstairs
waiting
for
you
a
he
will
have
left
word
about
the
car
in
any
case
lady
john
embarrassment
was
not
so
much
at
seeing
that
her
friend
had
divined
the
gist
of
the
arrangement
that
had
been
effected
downstairs
it
was
that
vida
should
be
at
no
pains
to
throw
a
decent
veil
over
the
fact
of
her
realization
that
lady
john
had
come
there
in
the
character
of
scout
with
an
openness
not
wholly
free
from
scorn
the
younger
woman
had
laid
her
own
cards
on
the
table
she
made
no
scruple
at
turning
her
back
on
lady
john
somewhat
incoherent
evasion
ignoring
it
she
crossed
the
room
and
opened
the
door
for
her
jean
was
in
the
corridor
saying
to
the
chairman
of
the
afternoon
trent
said
miss
levering
in
even
tones
did
expect
to
see
you
this
evening
he
came
forward
and
stood
in
the
doorway
not
have
i
ever
failed
john
said
vida
turning
is
one
of
our
allies
he
is
good
enough
to
squire
me
through
the
rabble
from
time
to
time
said
lady
john
advancing
quite
graciously
think
it
very
handsome
of
you
after
what
she
said
about
men
no
great
opinion
of
most
men
myself
said
the
young
gentleman
might
add
or
of
most
women
lady
john
laughed
any
rate
i
shall
go
away
relieved
to
think
that
miss
levering
plain
speaking
has
alienated
masculine
regard
should
it
he
said
right
lady
john
metaphorically
patted
him
on
the
back
believe
all
she
says
in
the
heat
of
propaganda
believe
all
she
says
but
i
not
cast
down
when
she
says
there
never
he
made
bold
to
interrupt
misogynist
of
sex
who
ended
by
deciding
to
make
an
exception
lady
john
smiled
significantly
what
you
build
on
he
demanded
with
an
effort
to
convey
logic
a
on
your
side
prove
equally
open
to
reason
aspect
of
the
question
has
become
irrelevant
so
far
as
personally
concerned
said
vida
exasperated
by
lady
john
look
of
pleased
significance
got
to
a
place
where
i
realize
that
the
first
battles
of
this
new
campaign
must
be
fought
by
women
alone
the
only
effective
help
men
could
give
amendment
of
the
law
they
refuse
the
rest
is
nothing
be
ungrateful
vida
here
is
this
gentleman
ready
to
face
criticism
in
publicly
championing
you
but
it
an
illusion
that
i
as
an
individual
need
a
champion
i
am
quite
safe
in
the
crowd
please
do
wait
for
me
and
do
come
for
me
again
the
sensitive
dark
face
flushed
course
if
you
rather
that
reminds
me
she
went
on
unfairly
punishing
poor
trent
for
lady
john
meaning
looks
was
asked
to
thank
you
and
to
tell
you
too
that
they
wo
need
your
chairmanship
any
more
though
that
i
beg
you
to
believe
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
feeling
of
mine
he
was
hurt
and
he
showed
it
course
i
know
there
must
be
other
men
ready
better
known
men
is
that
it
simply
that
we
find
a
man
ca
keep
a
rowdy
meeting
in
order
as
well
as
a
woman
he
stared
are
serious
said
lady
john
you
noticed
miss
levering
put
it
to
trent
all
our
worst
disturbances
come
when
men
are
in
charge
ha
well
a
i
had
connected
the
two
ideas
still
laughing
a
little
ruefully
he
suffered
himself
to
be
taken
downstairs
by
kind
little
miss
dunbarton
who
had
stood
without
a
word
waiting
there
with
absent
face
nice
boy
in
love
with
you
said
lady
john
vida
looked
at
her
without
answering
they
shook
hands
you
had
been
so
unkind
to
that
nice
boy
you
for
then
i
would
be
more
sure
of
your
telling
geoffrey
stonor
that
intelligent
women
do
nurse
their
wrongs
indefinitely
and
lie
in
wait
to
punish
them
are
sure
lady
john
went
up
close
and
looked
into
her
face
with
searching
anxiety
she
asked
vida
stood
there
mute
with
eyes
on
the
ground
lady
john
glanced
nervously
at
her
watch
and
with
a
gesture
of
perturbation
hurriedly
left
the
room
the
other
went
slowly
back
to
her
place
by
the
table
the
look
she
bent
on
stonor
as
he
came
in
seemed
to
take
no
account
of
those
hurried
glimpses
at
the
tunbridges
months
before
and
twice
when
other
eyes
were
watching
it
was
as
if
now
for
the
first
time
since
they
parted
he
stood
forth
clearly
this
man
with
the
changed
face
coming
in
at
the
door
and
carefully
shutting
it
he
had
once
been
mystery
high
priest
and
had
held
the
keys
of
joy
beyond
a
faint
pallor
there
was
no
trace
of
emotion
in
that
face
that
was
the
same
and
yet
so
different
not
even
anger
there
where
a
less
complex
man
would
have
brought
in
if
not
the
menace
of
a
storm
at
least
an
intimation
of
masterfulness
that
should
advertise
the
uselessness
of
opposition
stonor
brought
a
subtler
ally
in
what
for
lack
of
better
words
must
be
called
an
air
of
heightened
fastidiousness
mainly
physical
man
has
no
shrewder
weapon
against
the
woman
he
has
loved
and
wishes
to
exorcise
from
his
path
for
the
simple
and
even
for
those
not
so
much
simple
as
merely
sensitive
there
is
something
in
that
cool
sure
assumption
of
unapproachableness
on
the
part
of
one
who
once
had
been
so
near
something
that
lames
advance
and
hypnotizes
vision
geoffrey
stonor
aloofness
was
not
in
the
look
alone
it
was
as
much
as
anything
in
the
very
way
he
walked
as
if
the
ground
were
hardly
good
enough
in
the
way
he
laid
his
shapely
hand
on
the
carved
back
of
the
sofa
the
way
his
eyes
rested
on
inanimate
things
in
the
room
reducing
whoever
was
responsible
for
them
to
the
need
of
justifying
their
presence
and
defending
their
value
as
the
woman
in
the
chair
leaning
cheek
on
hand
sat
silently
watching
him
it
may
have
been
that
obscure
things
in
those
headlong
hours
of
the
past
grew
plainer
however
ludicrous
the
result
may
look
in
the
last
analysis
it
is
clear
that
a
faculty
such
as
stonor
for
overrating
the
value
of
the
individual
in
the
scheme
of
things
does
seem
more
effectually
than
any
mere
patent
of
nobility
to
confer
upon
a
man
the
right
to
dictate
to
his
fellows
and
to
look
down
upon
them
the
thing
is
founded
on
illusion
but
it
is
founded
as
firm
as
many
another
figment
that
has
governed
men
and
seen
the
generations
come
to
heel
and
go
crouching
to
their
graves
but
the
shining
superiority
of
the
man
seemed
to
be
a
little
dimmed
for
the
woman
sitting
there
the
old
face
and
the
new
face
she
saw
them
both
through
a
cloud
of
memories
and
a
mist
of
present
tears
have
they
primed
you
she
said
very
low
you
got
your
lesson
by
heart
at
last
he
looked
at
her
from
immeasurable
distance
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
you
he
said
he
waited
an
instant
then
seeing
no
explanation
vouchsafed
unpropitious
your
mood
may
be
he
went
on
with
a
satirical
edge
in
his
tone
shall
discharge
my
errand
still
she
waited
her
silence
seemed
to
irritate
him
have
promised
he
said
with
a
formality
that
smacked
of
insolence
offer
you
what
i
believe
is
called
amends
the
quick
change
in
the
brooding
look
should
have
warned
him
have
come
to
realize
then
after
all
these
years
that
you
owed
me
something
he
checked
himself
on
the
brink
of
protest
am
not
here
to
deny
it
then
she
said
fiercely
a
moment
dread
flickered
in
his
eye
and
then
was
gone
have
said
that
if
you
exact
it
i
will
if
i
insist
you
make
it
all
good
then
do
you
know
you
must
pay
me
in
kind
he
looked
down
upon
her
a
long
long
way
do
you
mean
me
back
what
you
took
from
me
my
old
faith
she
said
with
shaking
voice
me
that
if
you
mean
to
make
phrases
he
half
turned
away
but
the
swift
words
overtook
him
give
me
back
mere
kindness
or
even
tolerance
oh
i
do
mean
tolerance
she
was
on
her
feet
to
meet
his
eyes
as
he
faced
her
again
me
back
the
power
to
think
fairly
of
my
brothers
not
as
mockers
thieves
have
not
mocked
you
and
i
have
asked
you
you
knew
i
should
refuse
or
her
eyes
blazed
did
you
dare
to
be
afraid
i
would
i
suppose
he
buttressed
his
good
faith
with
bitterness
suppose
if
we
set
our
teeth
we
could
could
not
even
if
i
set
my
teeth
and
you
would
dream
of
asking
me
if
you
thought
there
was
the
smallest
chance
ever
so
faintly
he
raised
his
heavy
shoulders
can
do
no
more
than
make
you
an
offer
of
such
reparation
as
is
in
my
power
if
you
accept
it
he
turned
away
with
an
air
of
done
but
her
emotion
had
swept
her
out
of
her
course
she
found
herself
at
his
side
it
no
go
away
and
live
in
debt
pay
and
pay
and
pay
and
find
yourself
still
in
debt
for
a
thing
you
never
be
able
to
give
me
back
and
when
you
come
to
die
her
voice
fell
to
yourself
i
paid
all
my
creditors
but
one
he
stopped
on
his
way
to
the
door
and
faced
her
again
rather
tired
you
know
of
this
talk
of
debt
if
i
hear
that
you
persist
in
it
i
shall
have
to
again
he
checked
himself
i
keep
to
my
resolution
he
had
nearly
reached
the
threshold
she
saw
what
she
had
lost
by
her
momentary
lack
of
that
boasted
she
forestalled
him
at
the
door
resolution
she
asked
he
looked
down
at
her
an
instant
clothed
from
head
to
foot
in
that
indefinable
armour
of
unapproachableness
this
was
a
man
who
asked
other
people
questions
himself
to
be
catechised
if
he
replied
it
was
a
grace
came
here
he
said
considerable
pressure
to
speak
of
the
future
not
to
reopen
the
past
future
and
the
past
are
one
said
the
woman
at
the
door
talk
as
if
that
old
madness
was
mine
alone
it
is
the
woman
way
know
she
agreed
to
his
obvious
surprise
it
not
fair
men
suffer
as
well
as
we
by
the
woman
starting
wrong
we
are
taught
to
think
the
man
a
sort
of
if
he
tells
her
go
down
into
hell
down
into
hell
she
goes
he
would
not
have
been
human
had
he
not
resented
that
harsh
summary
of
those
days
that
lay
behind
no
mistake
he
said
the
woman
alone
go
down
they
go
down
together
but
the
man
comes
up
alone
as
a
rule
it
is
more
convenient
so
and
even
for
the
other
woman
both
pairs
of
eyes
went
to
jean
door
conscience
is
clear
he
said
angrily
know
and
so
do
you
that
most
men
in
my
position
would
have
troubled
themselves
i
gave
myself
endless
trouble
she
looked
at
him
with
wondering
eyes
you
gone
about
all
these
years
feeling
that
you
discharged
every
obligation
only
that
i
stood
by
you
with
a
fidelity
that
was
nothing
short
of
quixotic
if
you
recall
the
past
i
insist
on
your
recalling
it
correctly
think
i
do
recall
it
correctly
she
said
very
low
when
you
make
other
people
believe
that
i
deserted
you
the
gathering
volume
of
his
righteous
wrath
swept
the
cool
precision
out
of
his
voice
a
curious
enough
charge
he
said
you
stop
to
consider
again
he
checked
himself
and
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
was
for
sweeping
the
whole
thing
out
of
his
way
including
that
figure
at
the
door
but
she
stood
there
when
we
do
just
for
five
minutes
out
of
ten
years
when
we
do
stop
to
consider
remember
it
was
who
did
the
deserting
and
since
you
had
to
rake
the
story
up
you
might
have
had
the
fairness
to
tell
the
facts
think
the
facts
would
have
excused
you
it
was
a
new
view
she
left
the
door
and
sat
down
in
the
nearest
chair
doubt
you
forgotten
the
facts
since
lady
john
tells
me
you
would
remember
my
existence
once
a
year
if
the
papers
did
she
interrupted
with
a
sorry
little
smile
minded
that
mind
your
giving
false
impressions
he
said
with
spirit
as
she
was
about
to
speak
he
advanced
upon
her
you
deny
he
bent
over
her
and
told
off
those
three
words
by
striking
one
clenched
fist
into
the
palm
of
the
other
hand
you
deny
that
you
returned
my
letters
unopened
she
said
you
deny
that
you
refused
to
see
me
and
that
when
i
persisted
you
vanished
do
deny
any
of
those
things
he
stood
up
straight
again
and
his
shoulders
grew
more
square
with
justification
i
had
no
trace
of
you
for
years
suppose
not
well
then
he
walked
away
could
i
do
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
was
too
late
you
knew
since
you
read
the
papers
that
my
father
died
that
same
year
there
was
no
longer
any
barrier
between
us
yes
there
was
a
barrier
your
own
making
then
had
my
guilty
share
in
it
but
the
barrier
her
voice
trembled
on
the
word
barrier
was
your
invention
only
barrier
i
knew
of
was
no
invention
if
you
had
ever
known
my
father
the
echoes
the
echoes
she
lay
back
in
the
chair
often
you
used
to
say
if
i
knew
your
father
but
you
said
too
her
voice
sank
called
the
greatest
barrier
by
another
name
name
so
low
that
even
he
could
hardly
hear
she
answered
child
that
was
to
come
was
before
my
father
died
stonor
returned
hastily
i
still
hoped
to
get
his
consent
she
nodded
and
her
eyes
were
set
like
wide
doors
for
memory
to
enter
in
the
thought
of
that
personage
used
to
terrorize
me
what
chance
had
a
little
unborn
child
against
the
last
of
the
great
feudal
lords
as
you
called
him
the
child
would
have
stood
between
you
and
me
know
the
child
did
stand
between
you
and
me
he
stared
at
her
with
vague
uneasiness
he
repeated
stand
she
seemed
not
to
hear
the
tears
were
running
down
her
rigid
face
mothers
teach
their
children
mine
had
to
teach
me
talk
as
if
teach
me
that
a
woman
may
do
that
for
love
sake
that
shall
kill
love
neither
spoke
for
some
seconds
fearing
and
putting
from
him
fuller
comprehension
he
broke
the
silence
saying
with
an
air
of
finality
certainly
made
it
plain
you
had
no
love
left
for
me
had
need
of
it
all
for
the
child
her
voice
had
a
curious
crooning
note
in
it
he
came
closer
he
bent
down
to
put
the
low
question
you
mean
then
that
after
all
it
lived
i
mean
that
it
was
sacrificed
but
it
showed
me
no
barrier
is
so
impassable
as
the
one
a
little
child
can
raise
it
was
as
if
lightning
had
flashed
across
the
old
picture
he
drew
back
from
the
fierce
illumination
why
you
he
began
in
a
voice
that
was
almost
a
whisper
that
why
she
nodded
speechless
a
moment
for
tears
and
night
there
it
was
between
my
thought
of
you
and
me
he
sat
down
staring
at
her
i
was
most
unhappy
she
went
on
in
that
low
voice
would
wake
thinking
i
heard
it
cry
it
was
my
own
crying
i
heard
but
i
seemed
to
have
it
in
my
arms
i
suppose
i
was
mad
i
used
to
lie
there
in
that
lonely
farmhouse
pretending
to
hush
it
it
was
so
i
hushed
myself
never
knew
did
blame
you
you
could
risk
being
with
me
agreed
that
for
both
our
sakes
you
had
to
be
very
circumspect
you
were
so
well
known
your
autocratic
father
your
brilliant
political
future
fair
our
future
as
i
saw
it
then
everything
hung
on
concealment
it
must
have
looked
quite
simple
to
you
you
did
know
the
ghost
of
a
child
that
had
never
seen
the
light
the
frail
thing
you
meant
to
sweep
aside
and
forget
she
was
on
her
feet
swept
aside
and
forgotten
you
did
know
it
was
strong
enough
to
push
you
out
of
my
life
with
an
added
intensity
can
do
more
she
said
she
leaned
over
his
bowed
figure
and
whispered
can
push
that
girl
out
as
again
she
stood
erect
half
to
herself
she
added
can
do
more
still
you
threatening
me
he
said
dully
i
am
preparing
you
what
the
work
that
must
be
done
either
with
your
help
or
that
girl
the
man
eyes
lifted
a
moment
of
two
things
she
said
her
life
and
all
she
has
given
to
this
new
service
or
a
ransom
if
i
give
her
up
to
you
see
a
price
well
she
looked
searchingly
at
him
for
an
instant
and
then
slowly
shook
her
head
if
i
could
trust
you
to
pay
the
price
she
said
not
sure
but
what
a
young
and
ardent
soul
as
faithful
and
as
pure
as
hers
not
sure
but
i
should
make
a
poor
bargain
for
my
sex
to
give
that
up
for
anything
you
could
do
he
found
his
feet
like
a
man
roused
out
of
an
evil
dream
to
some
reality
darker
than
the
dream
spite
of
your
assumption
she
may
not
be
your
tool
he
said
are
horribly
afraid
she
is
but
you
are
wrong
she
an
instrument
in
stronger
hands
than
mine
soon
my
little
personal
influence
over
her
will
be
merged
in
something
infinitely
greater
oh
do
think
merely
i
that
have
got
hold
of
jean
dunbarton
else
new
spirit
that
abroad
with
an
exclamation
he
turned
away
and
though
his
look
branded
the
idea
for
a
wild
absurdity
he
began
to
pace
up
and
down
a
few
yards
from
jean
door
else
said
the
woman
that
inexperienced
girl
have
felt
the
new
loyalty
and
responded
as
she
did
new
indeed
he
said
under
his
breath
little
loyal
above
all
but
no
newer
than
electricity
was
when
it
first
lit
up
the
world
it
had
been
there
since
the
world
began
waiting
to
do
away
with
the
dark
has
the
thing
you
thing
i
fighting
and
the
violence
with
which
he
spoke
was
only
in
his
face
and
air
he
held
his
voice
down
to
its
lowest
register
thing
i
fighting
is
nothing
more
than
one
person
hold
upon
a
highly
sensitive
imagination
i
consented
to
this
interview
with
the
hope
he
made
a
gesture
of
impotence
only
remains
for
me
to
show
her
that
your
true
motive
is
revenge
say
that
to
her
and
you
are
lost
he
stole
an
uneasy
look
at
the
woman
out
of
a
face
that
had
grown
haggard
you
were
fighting
for
that
girl
only
against
me
you
win
she
said
is
so
and
you
will
fail
the
influence
that
has
hold
of
her
is
in
the
very
air
no
soul
knows
where
it
comes
from
except
that
it
comes
from
the
higher
sources
of
civilization
see
the
origin
of
it
before
my
eyes
little
as
you
see
the
beginnings
of
life
this
is
like
the
other
mysterious
forces
of
mother
earth
no
warning
given
no
sign
a
night
wind
passes
over
the
brown
land
and
in
the
morning
the
fields
are
green
his
look
was
the
look
of
one
who
sees
happiness
slipping
away
it
passes
over
gardens
like
a
frost
he
said
the
flowers
die
know
that
is
what
men
fear
it
even
seems
as
if
it
must
be
through
fear
that
your
enlightenment
will
come
the
strangest
things
make
you
men
afraid
that
why
i
see
a
value
in
jean
dunbarton
far
beyond
her
fortune
he
looked
at
her
dully
than
any
other
girl
i
know
if
i
keep
her
from
you
that
gentle
inflexible
creature
could
rouse
in
men
the
old
fear
are
you
mad
she
echoed
those
are
the
words
in
the
middle
ages
men
cried
out
and
burnt
her
the
woman
who
served
no
bed
or
board
want
to
make
the
poor
child
believe
sees
for
herself
we
come
to
a
place
where
we
find
there
a
value
in
women
apart
from
the
value
men
see
in
them
you
teach
us
not
to
look
to
you
for
some
of
the
things
we
need
most
if
women
must
be
freed
by
women
we
have
need
of
such
as
her
eyes
went
to
the
door
that
stonor
still
had
an
air
of
guarding
knows
she
may
be
the
new
joan
of
arc
he
paused
and
for
that
moment
he
seemed
as
bankrupt
in
denunciation
as
he
was
in
hope
this
personal
application
of
the
new
heresy
found
him
merely
aghast
with
no
words
but
should
be
the
sacrifice
have
taught
us
to
look
very
calmly
on
the
sacrifice
of
women
was
the
ruthless
answer
tell
us
in
every
tongue
it
a
necessary
evil
he
stood
still
a
moment
staring
at
the
ground
girl
happiness
against
a
thing
nobler
than
happiness
for
thousands
who
can
hesitate
god
ca
you
see
that
this
crazed
campaign
you
start
her
on
even
if
it
successful
it
can
only
be
so
through
the
help
of
men
what
excuse
shall
you
make
your
own
soul
for
not
going
straight
to
the
goal
think
we
would
be
glad
she
said
go
straight
to
the
goal
do
i
see
you
much
rather
punish
me
and
see
her
revel
in
a
morbid
say
i
want
to
punish
you
only
because
like
other
men
you
take
the
trouble
to
understand
what
we
do
want
or
how
determined
we
are
to
have
it
you
ca
kill
this
new
spirit
among
women
she
went
nearer
you
could
make
a
greater
mistake
than
to
think
it
finds
a
home
only
in
the
exceptional
or
the
unhappy
it
is
so
strange
to
see
a
man
like
you
as
much
deluded
as
the
hyde
park
loafers
who
say
to
ernestine
blunt
who
hurt
feelings
why
not
realize
she
came
still
closer
if
she
had
put
out
her
hand
she
would
have
touched
him
is
a
thing
that
goes
deeper
than
personal
experience
and
yet
she
said
in
a
voice
so
hushed
that
it
was
full
of
a
sense
of
the
girl
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
you
take
only
the
narrowest
personal
view
a
good
deal
depends
on
what
you
and
i
agree
upon
in
the
next
five
minutes
recommend
my
realizing
the
larger
issues
but
in
your
ambition
to
attach
that
poor
girl
to
the
of
progress
his
voice
put
the
drag
of
ironic
pomposity
upon
the
phrase
quite
ignore
the
fact
that
people
fitter
for
such
work
the
men
you
look
to
enlist
in
the
end
are
ready
waiting
he
pulled
himself
up
in
time
for
an
give
the
thing
a
chance
are
ready
what
men
his
eyes
evaded
hers
he
picked
his
words
have
themselves
to
blame
that
the
question
has
grown
so
delicate
that
responsible
people
shrink
for
the
moment
from
being
implicated
in
it
have
seen
the
shrinking
quoting
any
one
else
i
might
point
out
that
the
new
antagonism
seems
to
have
blinded
you
to
the
small
fact
that
i
for
one
am
not
an
opponent
phrase
has
a
familiar
ring
we
have
heard
it
four
hundred
and
twenty
times
his
eyes
were
shining
with
anger
spoke
if
i
may
say
so
of
some
one
who
would
count
some
one
who
can
carry
his
party
along
with
him
or
risk
a
seat
in
the
cabinet
over
the
issue
you
mean
you
are
ready
to
do
that
she
exclaimed
hour
ago
i
was
an
hour
ago
you
do
understand
men
they
can
be
led
they
ca
be
driven
ten
minutes
before
you
came
into
the
room
i
was
ready
to
say
i
would
throw
in
my
political
lot
with
this
reform
now
you
block
my
way
by
an
attempt
at
coercion
by
forcing
my
hand
you
give
my
adherence
an
air
of
for
a
personal
end
exactly
the
mistake
of
the
ignorant
agitators
in
trafalgar
square
you
have
a
great
deal
to
learn
this
movement
will
go
forward
not
because
of
the
agitation
outside
but
in
spite
of
it
there
are
men
in
parliament
who
would
have
been
actively
serving
the
reform
as
actively
as
so
vast
a
constitutional
change
she
smiled
faintly
they
have
done
it
because
it
would
have
put
a
premium
on
breaches
of
decent
behaviour
and
defiance
of
the
law
she
looked
at
him
with
an
attempt
to
appear
to
accept
this
version
what
did
it
matter
what
reasons
were
given
for
past
failure
if
only
the
future
might
be
assured
he
had
taken
a
piece
of
crumpled
paper
from
his
pocket
and
smoothed
it
out
here
he
held
the
telegram
before
her
she
flushed
with
excitement
as
she
read
is
very
good
i
see
only
one
objection
have
sent
it
is
your
fault
and
he
looked
as
if
he
thought
he
spoke
the
truth
did
you
write
this
before
you
came
in
when
she
began
to
talk
about
jean
vida
gave
him
back
the
paper
must
have
pleased
jean
it
was
a
master
stroke
the
casual
giving
back
and
the
invocation
of
a
pleasure
that
had
been
strangled
at
the
birth
along
with
something
greater
did
he
see
before
him
again
the
girl
hopeless
eyes
that
had
not
so
much
as
read
the
wonderful
message
too
intent
upon
the
of
their
common
happiness
he
threw
himself
heavily
into
a
chair
staring
at
the
closed
door
behind
it
in
a
prison
of
which
this
woman
held
the
key
jean
waited
for
her
life
sentence
stonor
look
his
attitude
seemed
to
say
that
he
too
only
waited
now
to
hear
it
he
dropped
his
head
in
his
hand
when
vida
spoke
it
was
without
raising
her
eyes
from
the
ground
could
drive
a
bargain
with
you
but
i
think
i
wo
if
love
and
ambition
both
urge
you
on
perhaps
she
looked
up
a
little
defiantly
seeming
to
expect
to
meet
triumph
in
his
face
instead
her
eye
took
in
the
profound
hopelessness
of
the
bent
head
the
slackness
of
the
big
frame
that
so
suddenly
had
assumed
a
look
of
age
she
went
over
to
him
silently
and
stood
by
his
side
all
she
said
has
been
quite
fair
to
you
at
the
new
thing
in
her
voice
he
raised
his
heavy
eyes
fall
out
of
one
ardent
woman
dreams
into
another
she
said
you
do
after
all
you
do
mean
to
keep
you
and
her
apart
no
for
the
first
time
tears
came
into
his
eyes
after
a
little
silence
he
held
out
his
hand
can
i
do
for
you
she
seemed
not
to
see
the
hand
he
offered
or
did
she
only
see
that
it
was
empty
she
was
looking
at
the
other
mere
instinct
made
him
close
his
left
hand
more
firmly
on
the
message
it
was
as
if
something
finer
than
her
slim
fingers
the
invisible
antennÃ¦
felt
the
force
that
would
need
be
overcome
if
trial
of
strength
should
be
precipitated
then
upon
his
can
i
do
she
shook
her
head
the
real
you
he
said
the
reformer
or
the
politician
for
the
woman
i
so
unwillingly
hurt
as
she
only
turned
away
he
stood
up
detaining
her
with
a
hold
upon
her
arm
may
not
believe
it
but
now
that
i
understand
there
is
almost
nothing
i
would
do
to
right
that
old
wrong
nothing
to
be
done
she
said
and
then
shrinking
under
that
look
of
almost
cheerful
benevolence
can
never
give
me
back
my
child
more
than
at
the
words
at
the
anguish
in
her
face
his
own
had
changed
that
ghost
give
you
no
rest
he
said
oh
yes
she
was
calm
again
see
life
is
nobler
than
i
knew
there
is
work
to
do
on
her
way
to
the
great
folding
doors
once
again
he
stopped
her
should
you
think
that
it
only
you
these
ten
years
have
taught
something
to
why
not
give
even
a
man
credit
for
a
willingness
to
learn
something
of
life
and
for
being
sorry
profoundly
sorry
for
the
pain
his
instruction
has
cost
others
you
seem
to
think
i
taken
it
all
quite
lightly
that
not
fair
all
my
life
ever
since
you
disappeared
the
thought
of
you
has
hurt
i
would
give
anything
i
possess
to
know
you
were
happy
again
happiness
should
you
find
it
still
he
said
it
with
a
significance
that
made
her
stare
and
then
see
she
could
help
telling
you
about
allen
trent
lady
john
could
he
ignored
the
interpretation
one
of
the
people
the
years
have
not
taken
from
but
given
more
to
you
are
more
than
ever
you
have
lost
your
beauty
gods
saw
it
was
so
little
effectual
it
was
worth
taking
away
she
stood
staring
out
into
the
void
woman
mishap
what
is
that
a
thing
as
trivial
to
the
great
world
as
it
sordid
in
most
eyes
but
the
time
has
come
when
a
woman
may
look
about
her
and
say
what
general
significance
has
my
secret
pain
does
it
join
on
to
anything
and
i
find
it
i
no
longer
simply
a
woman
who
has
stumbled
on
the
way
with
difficulty
she
controlled
the
shake
in
her
voice
one
who
has
got
up
bruised
and
bleeding
wiped
the
dust
from
her
hands
and
the
tears
from
her
face
and
said
to
herself
not
merely
here
one
luckless
woman
but
here
is
a
stone
of
stumbling
to
many
let
see
if
it
ca
be
moved
out
of
other
women
way
and
she
calls
people
to
come
and
help
no
mortal
man
let
alone
a
woman
can
move
that
rock
of
offence
but
she
ended
with
a
sudden
sombre
flare
of
enthusiasm
help
geoffrey
the
thing
can
be
done
he
looked
down
on
her
from
his
height
with
a
wondering
pity
how
you
care
he
said
while
the
mist
deepened
before
his
eyes
be
so
sad
she
said
not
seeming
to
see
his
sadness
was
not
for
himself
it
was
as
if
she
could
not
turn
her
back
on
him
this
last
time
without
leaving
him
comforted
i
tell
you
a
secret
jean
ardent
dreams
need
frighten
you
if
she
has
a
child
from
the
beginning
it
was
not
the
strong
arm
it
was
the
weakest
the
little
little
arms
that
subdued
the
fiercest
of
us
he
held
out
a
shaking
hand
so
uncertain
that
it
might
have
been
begging
pity
or
it
might
have
been
bestowing
it
even
then
she
did
not
take
it
but
a
great
gentleness
was
in
her
face
as
she
said
will
have
other
children
geoffrey
for
me
there
was
to
be
only
one
well
well
she
brushed
the
tears
away

tried
and
failed
to
make
a
decent
world
for
the
little
children
to
live
in

of

are

said
quietly

up

hat
and
cloak
are
the
ones
who
have
no
excuse
for
standing
aloof
from
