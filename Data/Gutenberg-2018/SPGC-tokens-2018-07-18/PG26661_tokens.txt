slut
of

never
so
much
as
dreamt
of

all
about
it
i
never
even
dreamt
of
it
that
flat
my
old
dad
has
got
it
all
out
of
his
own
pate
anísya
if
you
do
wish
it
yourself
who
can
force
you
he
ca
drive
you
like
an
ass
nikíta

i
reckon
it
not
possible
to
go
against
one
parent
but
it
not
by
my
wish
anísya
do
you
budge
that
all
about
it
nikíta
there
was
a
fellow
would
budge
and
the
village
elder
gave
him
such
a
hiding
that
what
it
might
come
to
i
no
great
wish
for
that
sort
of
thing
they
say
it
touches
one
up
anísya
shut
up
with
your
nonsense
nikíta
listen
to
me
if
you
marry
that
marína
i
do
know
what
i
wo
do
to
myself
i
shall
lay
hands
on
myself
i
have
sinned
i
have
gone
against
the
law
but
i
ca
go
back
now
if
you
go
away
nikíta
why
should
i
go
had
i
wanted
to
go
i
should
have
gone
long
ago
there
was
iván
semyónitch
day
offered
me
a
place
as
his
coachman
only
fancy
what
a
life
that
would
have
been
but
i
did
not
go
because
i
reckon
i
am
good
enough
for
any
one
now
if
you
did
not
love
me
it
would
be
a
different
matter
anísya
yes
and
that
what
you
should
remember
my
old
man
will
die
one
of
these
fine
days
i
thinking
then
we
could
cover
our
sin
make
it
all
right
and
lawful
and
then
you
be
master
here
nikíta
where
the
good
of
making
plans
what
do
i
care
i
work
as
hard
as
if
i
were
doing
it
for
myself
my
master
loves
me
and
his
missus
loves
me
and
if
the
wenches
run
after
me
it
not
my
fault
flat
anísya
and
you
love
me
nikíta
embracing
her
there
as
you
have
ever
been
in
my
heart
matryóna
enters
and
crosses
herself
a
long
time
before
the
icón
nikíta
and
anísya
step
apart
what
i
saw
i
did
perceive
what
i
heard
i
did
hearken
to
playing
with
the
lass
eh
well
even
a
calf
will
play
why
should
one
have
some
fun
when
one
young
but
your
master
is
out
in
the
yard
you
sonnie
nikíta
i
only
came
to
get
the
axe
matryóna
i
know
sonnie
i
know
them
sort
of
axes
are
mostly
to
be
found
where
the
women
are
nikíta
stooping
to
pick
up
axe
i
say
mother
is
it
true
you
want
me
to
marry
as
i
reckon
that
quite
unnecessary
besides
i
got
no
wish
that
way
matryóna
eh
honey
why
should
you
marry
go
on
as
you
are
it
all
the
old
man
you
better
go

can
talk
these
matters
over
without
you
nikíta
it
a
queer
go
one
moment
i
to
be
married
the
next
not
i
ca
make
head
or
tail
of
it
exit
anísya
what
it
all
about

you
really
wish
him

get
married
matryóna
eh
why
should
he
marry
my
jewel
it
all
nonsense

my
old
man
drivel
marry

but
he
reckoning
without
his
host
you
know
the
saying
from
oats
and
hay
why
should
horses
stray
when
you
enough
and
to
spare
why
look
elsewhere
and
so
in
this
case
winks
do
i
see
which
way
the
wind
blows
anísya
where
the
good
of
my
pretending
to
you
mother
matryóna
you
know
all
about
it
i
have
sinned
i
love
your

brick
wall

see
your
old
man
quite
seedy
quite
seedy
how
one
to
live
with
such
as
him
why
if
you
pricked
him
with
a
it
would
fetch
blood
see
if
you
do
bury
him
before
the
spring
then
you
need
some
one
in
the
house
well
what
wrong
with
my
son

as
well
as

advantage
of
my
taking

i
my
child
enemy
anísya
oh
if
only
he
does
not
go
away
matryóna
he
wo
go
away
birdie
it
all
nonsense
you
know
my
old
man
his
wits
are
always
yet
sometimes
he
takes
a
thing
into
his
pate
and
it
as
if
it
were
wedged
in
you
ca
knock
it
out
with
a
hammer
anísya
and
what
started
this
business
matryóna
well
you
see
my
jewel
you
yourself
know
what
a
fellow
with
women
the
lad
is
and
he
handsome
too
though
i
say
it
as
should
well
you
know
he
was
living
at
the
railway
and
they
had
an
orphan
wench
there
to
cook
for
them
well
that
same
wench
took
to
running
after
him
anísya
marína
matryóna
yes
the
plague
seize
her
whether
anything
happened
or
not
anyhow
something
got
to
my
old
man
ears
maybe
he
heard
from
the
neighbours
maybe
she
been
and
blabbed
anísya
well
she
is
a
bold
hussy
matryóna
so
my
old
man
the
old
blockhead
off
he
goes
marry
marry
he
says
he
must
marry
her
and
cover
the
sin
he
says
we
must
take
the
lad
home
he
says
and
he
shall
marry
he
says
well
i
did
my
best
to
make
him
change
his
mind
but
dear
me
no
so
all
right
thinks
i
i
try
another
dodge
one
always
has
to
entice
them
fools
in
this
way
just
pretend
to
be
of
their
mind
and
when
it
comes
to
the
point
one
goes
and
turns
it
all
one
own
way
you
know
a
woman
has
time
to
think
thoughts
while
falling
off
the
oven
so
how
such
as
he
to
see
through
it
well
yes
says
i
it
would
be
a
good
job
only
we
must
consider
well
beforehand
why
not
go
and
see
our
son
and
talk
it
over
with
peter
ignátitch
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
so
here
we
are
anísya
oh
dear
oh
dear
how
will
it
all
end
supposing
his
father
just
orders
him
to
marry
her
matryóna
orders
indeed
chuck
his
orders
to
the
dogs
do
you
worry
that
affair
will
never
come
off
i
go
to
your
old
man
myself
and
sift
and
strain
this
matter
clear
there
will
be
none
of
it
left
i
have
come
here
only
for
the
look
of
the
thing
a
very
likely
thing
here
my
son
living
in
happiness
and
expecting
happiness
and
i
go
and
match
him
with
a
slut
no
fear
i
not
a
fool
anísya
and
she
this
marína
came
dangling
after
him
here
mother
would
you
believe
when
they
said
he
was
going
to
marry
it
was
as
if
a
knife
had
gone
right
through
my
heart
i
thought
he
cared
for
her
matryóna
oh
my
jewel
why

that
if

time

money
if

evil
my
jewel
if
your
old
man
was
hale
and
hearty
be
a
different
matter
but
he
neither
alive
nor
dead
as
it
is
he
not
for
this
world
such
things
often
happen
anísya
my
poor
head
i
afeared
mother
matryóna
lest
some
evil
come
of
them
no
that
wo
do
matryóna
just
as
you
like
i
might
even
return
them
to
him
anísya
and
are
they
to
be
used
in
the
same
way
as
the
others
mixed
in
water
matryóna
better
in
tea
he
says
you
ca
notice
anything
he
says
no
smell
nor
nothing
he
a
cute
old
fellow
too
illustration
the
power
of
darkness
act
matryóna
gives
anísya
the
powders
anísya
taking
the
powder
my
poor
head
could
i
have
ever
thought
of
such
a
thing
if
my
life
were
not
a
very
hell
matryóna
you
not
forget
that
rouble
i
promised
to
take
it
to
the
old
man
he
had
some
trouble
too
anísya
of
course
goes
to
her
box
and
hides
the
powders
matryóna
and
now
my
jewel
keep
it
as
close
as
you
can
so
that
no
one
should
find
it
out
heaven
defend
that
it
should
happen
but
any
one
notices
it
tell
it
for
the
takes
the
rouble
it
also
used
for
beetles
stops
short
enter
akím
who
crosses
himself
in
front
of
the
icón
and
then
peter
who
sits
down
peter
well
then
how
it
to
be
daddy
akím
akím
as
it
best
peter
ignátitch
as
it
best
i
mean
as
best
why
i
afeared
of
what
call
some
tomfoolery
you
know
i
like
to
what
call
it
to
start
you
know
start
the
lad
honest
i
mean
but
supposing
you
rather
what
call
it
we
might
i
mean
what
name
as
it
best
peter
all
right
all
right
sit
down
and
let
talk
it
over
akím
sits
down
well
then
what
it
all
about
you
want
him
to
marry
matryóna
as
to
marrying
he
might
bide
a
while
peter
ignátitch
you
know
our
poverty
peter
ignátitch
what
he
to
marry
on
we
hardly
enough
to
eat
ourselves
how
can
he
marry
then
peter
you
must
consider
what
will
be
best
matryóna
where
the
hurry
for
him
to
get
married
marriage
is
not
that
sort
of
thing
it
not
like
ripe
raspberries
that
drop
off
if
not
picked
in
time
peter
if
he
were
to
get
married
be
a
good
thing
in
a
way
akím
we
like
to
what
call
it
why
you
see
i
what
call
it
a
job
i
mean
i
found
a
paying
job
in
town
you
know
matryóna
and
a
fine
job
too
cleaning
out
cesspools
the
other
day
when
he
came
home
i
could
do
nothing
but
spew
and
spew
faugh
akím
it
true
at
first
it
does
seem
what
call
it
knocks
one
clean
over
you
know
the
smell
i
mean
but
one
gets
used
to
it
and
then
it
nothing
no
worse
than
malt
grain
and
then
it
what
call
it
pays
pays
i
mean
and
as
to
the
smell
being
what
call
it
it
not
for
the
likes
of
us
to
complain
and
one
changes
clothes
so
we
like
to
take
what
his
name
nikíta
i
mean
home
let
him
manage
things
at
home
while
i
what
call
it
earn
something
in
town
peter
you
want
to
keep
your
son
at
home
yes
that
would
be
well
but
how
about
the
money
he
has
had
in
advance
akím
that
it
that
it
it
just
as
you
say
ignátitch
it
just
what
call
it
why
if
you
go
into
service
it
as
good
as
if
you
had
sold
yourself
they
say
that
will
be
all
right
i
mean
he
may
stay
and
serve
his
time
only
he
must
what
call
it
get
married
i
mean
so
you
let
him
off
for
a
little
while
that
he
may
what
call
it
peter
yes
we
could
manage
that
matryóna
ah
but
it
not
yet
settled
between
ourselves
peter
ignátitch
i
speak
to
you
as
i
would
before
god
and
you
may
judge
between
my
old
man
and
me
he
goes
on
harping
on
that
marriage
but
just
ask
who
it
is
he
wants
him
to
marry
if
it
were
a
girl
of
the
right
sort
now
i
am
not
my
child
enemy
but
the
wench
is
not
honest

wrong

you
cleared
the
way
clean
as
with
water
yes
let
the
lad
speak
for
himself
nowadays
you
know
they
not
let
you
force
a
son
to
marry
one
must
first
of
all
ask
the
lad
he
never
consent
to
marry
her
and
disgrace
himself
not
for
all
the
world
to
my
thinking
it
best
he
should
go
on
living
with
you
and
serving
you
as
his
master
and
we
need
not
take
him
home
for
the
summer
either
we
can
hire
a
help
if
you
would
only
give
us
ten
roubles
now
we
let
him
stay
on
peter
all
in
good
time
first
let
us
settle
one
thing
before
we
start
another
akím
you
see
peter
ignátitch
i
speak
why
you
know
how
it
happens
we
try
to
fix
things
up
as
seems
best
for
ourselves
you
know
and
as
to
god
we
what
call
it
we
forget
him
we
think
it
best
so
turn
it
our
own
way
and
lo
we
got
into
a
fix
you
know
we
think
it
will
be
best
i
mean
and
lo
it
turns
out
much
worse
without
god
i
mean
peter
of
course
one
must
not
forget
god
akím
it
turns
out
worse
but
when
it
the
right
way
god
way
it
what
call
it
it
gives
one
joy
seems
pleasant
i
mean
so
i
reckon

get
him
to
marry
her
to
keep
him
from
sin
i
mean
and

mean
while
i
go
and
get
the
job
in
town
the
work
is
of
the
right
sort
it
payin
i
mean
and
in
god
sight
it
what
call
it
it
best
i
mean
ai

well
and
did
you
look
there
anísya
i
could
the

in

room
i
notice
that
sometimes
he
carries
it
about
on
him
and
sometimes
he
hides
it
matryóna
but
you
my
lass
must
remember
that
if
once
he
gives
you
the
slip

did
you
give
him
the
strong
tea
anísya
oh

sees
neighbour
and
stops
the
neighbour
a
woman

hut
and
listens
to
a
call
from
within
neighbour
to
anísya
i
say
anísya
eh

there
your
old
man
calling

think
anísya
that
the
way
he
always
coughs
just
as
if
he
were
screaming
he
getting
very
bad
neighbour
approaches
matryóna
how
do
you
do
granny
have
you
come
far
matryóna
straight
from
home
dear
come
to
see
my

help
thinking
of
these
things
you
see
when
one
own
child
neighbour

so
to
anísya

has
begun
yet
anísya
where
the
hurry

a
look
at
him
yesterday
dearie
me
one
wonders
his
body
and
soul
keep
together
and
o
lord
the
other
day
he
seemed
just
at
his
last
gasp
so
that
they
laid
him
under
the
holy
icóns
they
started
lamenting
and
got
ready
to
lay
him
out
it
is
customary
to
place
a
dying
person
under
the
icón
one
or
more
icóns
hang
in
the
hut
of
each
orthodox
peasant
anísya
he

extreme
unction
anísya
the
neighbours
advise
it
if
he
lives
till
we
send
for
the
priest
neighbour
oh
anísya
dear
i
should
think
your
heart
must
be
heavy
as
the
saying
goes
not
he
is
sick
that
ill
in
bed
but
he
that
sits
and
waits
in
dread
anísya
yes
if
it
were
only
over
one
way
or
other
neighbour
yes
that
true
dying
for
a
year
it
no
joke
bound
hand
and
foot
like
that
matryóna
ah
but
a
widow
lot
is
also
bitter
it
all
right
as
long
as
one
young
but
who
care
for
you
when
you
old
oh
yes
old
age
is
not
pleasure
just
look
at
me
i
not
walked
very
far

we
had
a
wedding
down
in
our
parts
neighbour
what
in
spring
peasant
weddings

are
forbidden
in
lent
and
soon
after
easter
the
peasants
become
too
busy
to
marry
till
harvest
is
over
matryóna
ah
now
if
it
were
a
poor
man

always
unseasonable
for
a
poor
man
to
marry
but

simon
matvéyitch

married

marína
anísya

luck

decent
girl
would
have

people
say
to

rich
peasant

must
not
forget
me
when
the
time
comes
nikíta
and
what
it
you
been
bothering
about
matryóna
about
your
affairs
about
your
future
if
you
do
take
trouble
in
good
time
you
get
nothing
you
know
iván
moséitch
well
i
been
to
him
too
i
went
there
the
other
day
i
had
something
else
to
settle
you
know
well
so
i
sat
and
chatted
awhile
and
then
came
to
the
point
tell
me
iván
moséitch
says
i
how
one
to
manage
an
affair
of
this
kind
supposing
says
i
a
peasant
as
is
a
widower
married
a
second
wife
and
supposing
all
the
children
he
has
is
a
daughter
by
the
first
wife
and
a
daughter
by
the
second
then
says
i
when
that
peasant
dies
could
an
outsider
get
hold
of
the
homestead
by
marrying
the
widow
could
he
says
i
give
both
the
daughters
in
marriage
and
remain
master
of
the
house
himself
yes
he
could
says
he
but
says
he
it
would
mean
a
deal
of
trouble
still
the
thing
could
be
managed
by
means
of
money
but
if
there
no
money
it
no
good
trying
nikíta
laughs
that
goes
without
saying
only
fork
out
the
money
who
does
not
want
money
matryóna
well
then
honey
so
i
spoke
out
plainly
about
the
affair
and
he
says
first
and
foremost
your
son
will
have
to
get
himself
on
the
register
of
that
village
that
will
cost
something
the
elders
will
have
to
be
treated
and
they
you
see
they
sign
everything
says
he
must
be
done
sensibly
look
unwraps
her
kerchief
and
takes
out
a
paper
he
written
out
this
paper
just
read
it
you
a
scholar
you
know
nikíta
reads
nikíta
this
paper
only
a
decision
for
the
elders
to
sign
there
no
great
wisdom
needed
for
that
matryóna
but
you
just
hear
what
iván
moséitch
bids
us
do
above
all
he
says
mind
and
do
let
the
money
slip
away
dame
if
she
do
get
hold
of
the
money
he
says
they
not
let
her
do
it
money
the
great
thing
so
look
out
sonnie
things
are
coming
to
a
head
nikíta
what
that
to
me
the
money
hers
so
let
her
look
out
matryóna

sonnie
how
you
look
at
it
how
can
a
woman
manage
such
affairs
even
if
she
does
get
the
money

she
capable
of
arranging
it
all
one

what
a
woman
is

man
anyhow
you
can
hide
it
and
all
that

more
sense
in
case
of
anything
happening

gentle
when

had
a
drop
he
used
to
hit
out
before
but
of
me
he
was
always
fond

not
right
i
ca
feel
well
it
the
old
woman
affair
enter
matryóna
from
hut
matryóna
and
i
was
just
thinking
where
the
father
where
the
father
and
here
you
are
dear
friend
well
dear
friend
the
lord
be
thanked
everything
is
as
honourable
as
can
be
when
one
arranging
a
match
one
should
not
boast
and
i
have
never
learnt
to
boast
but
as
you
come
about
the
right
business
so
with
the
lord
help
you
be
grateful
to
me
all
your
life
she
a
wonderful
girl
there
no
other
like
her
in
all
the
district
the
father
that
true
enough
but
how
about
the
money
matryóna
do
you
trouble
about
the
money
all
she
had
from
her
father
goes
with
her
and
it
more
than
one
gets
easily
as
things
are
nowadays
three
times
fifty
roubles
the
father
we
do
complain
but
it
for
our
own
child
naturally
we
want
to
get
the
best
we
can
matryóna
i
tell
you
straight
friend
if
it
had
been
for
me
you
never
have
found
anything
like
her
they
had
an
offer
from
the
karmílins
but
i
stood
out
against
it
and
as
for
the
money
i
tell
you
truly
when
her
father
god
be
merciful
to
his
soul
was
dying
he
gave
orders
that
the
widow
should
take
nikíta
into
the
homestead
of
course
i
know
all
about
it
from
my
son
and
the
money
was
to
go
to
akoulína
why
another
one
might
have
thought
of
his
own
interests
but
nikíta
gives
everything
clean
it
no
trifle
fancy
what
a
sum
it
is
the
father
people
are
saying
that
more
money
was
left
her
the
sharp
too
matryóna
oh
dear
soul
alive
a
slice
in
another
hand
always
looks
big
all
she
had
will
be
handed
over
i
tell
you
throw
doubts
to
the
wind
and
make
all
sure
what
a
girl
she
is
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
the
father
that
so
but
my
old
woman
and
i
were
only
wondering
about
the
girl
why
has
she
not
come
out
we
been
thinking
suppose
sickly
matryóna
oh
ah
who
she
sickly
why
there
none
to
compare
with
her
in
the
district
the
girl
as
sound
as
a
bell
you
ca
pinch
her
but
you
saw
her
the
other
day
and
as
for
work
she
wonderful
she
a
bit
deaf
that
true
but
there
are
spots
on
the
sun
you
know
and
her
not
coming
out
you
see
it
from
an
evil
eye
a
spell
been
cast
on
her
and
i
know
the
bitch
who
done
the
business
they
know
of
the
betrothal
and
they
bewitched
her
but
i
know
a
the
girl
will
get
up

about
the
girl

was
not

there
lots
of
such
cases

her
up

in
their

house
that
where
we
came
to
a
village
the
soldiers
began
hunting
about
in
the
house
when
suddenly
that
same
little
girl
lying
on
the
floor
flat
on
her
stomach
we
were
going
to
give
her
a
knock
on
the
head
but
all
at
once
i
felt
that
sorry
that
i
took
her
up
in
my
arms
but
no
she
would
let
me
made
herself
so
heavy
quite
a
hundredweight
and
caught
hold
where
she
could
with
her
hands
so
that
one
could
get
them
off
well
so
i
began
stroking
her
head
it
was
so
bristly
just
like
a
hedgehog
so
i
stroked
and
stroked
and
she
quieted
down
at
last
i
soaked
a
bit
of
rusk
and
gave
it
her
she
understood
that
and
began
nibbling
what
were
we
to
do
with
her
we
took
her
took
her
and
began
feeding
and
feeding
her
and
she
got
so
used
to
us
that
we
took
her
with
us
on
the
march
and
so
she
went
about
with
us
ah
she
was
a
fine
girl
nan
yes
and
not
baptized
mítritch
who
can
tell
they
used
to
say
not
altogether
why
those
people
were
our
own
nan
germans

idea

seems
to
be
before
my
eyes
now
out
of
all
my
time
of

flogged
me
and
i
remember
that
girl

her
so
that
was
a
girl

better
you
not
find
one
we
gave
her
away
afterwards
the
captain
wife
took
her
to
bring
up
as
her
daughter

she
was
all
right
how
sorry
the
soldiers
were
to
let
her
go
probably
kurds

and
i
remember
when
father
was
dying

me
nikíta

go
to
god

sure
to
go
to
the
bad
mítritch
and
how
to
the
bad
how
should
the
likes
of
you
not
go
to
the
bad
who
teaches
you
what
do
you
see
what
do
you
hear
only
vileness
i
though
i
not
been
taught
much
still
know
a
thing
or
two
i
not
quite
like
a
peasant
woman
a
peasant
woman
what
is
she
just
mud
there
are
many
millions
of
the
likes
of
you
in
russia
and
all
as
blind
as
moles
knowing
nothing
all
sorts
of
spells
how
to
stop
the
with
a
plough
and
how
to
cure
children
by
putting
them
under
the
perches
in
the
that
what
they
know
nan
yes
mother
also
did
that
mítritch
yes
there
it
is
just
so
so
many
millions
of
girls
and
women
and
all
like
beasts
in
a
forest
as
she
grows
up
so
she
dies
never
sees
anything
never
hears
anything
a
peasant
he
may
learn
something
at
the
pub
or
maybe
in
prison
or
in
the
army
as
i
did
but
a
woman
let
alone
about
god
she
does
even
know
rightly
what
friday
it
is
friday
friday
but
ask
her
what
friday
she
do
know
they
like
blind
puppies
creeping
about
and
poking
their
noses
into
the
all
they

their
silly
songs

that
all
the
teaching
you
get
i
do
know
who

to
answer
for
you
for
a
recruit
the

the
corporal

to
answer
but
for
the
likes
of

no
one
responsible

cattle
that

most
mischievous

walking
past
the
barn
towards
the
hut
first

there
you

the
street
is
terribly
muddy
stop
and
wipe
their
boots
on
the

first

one
mítritch
their

lament
this

to
the
songs
customary
at
the
wedding
of
russian
peasants
praising
the
bride

bridegroom
it
is
etiquette
for
a
