preface
as
things
now
stand
the
course
of
instruction
in
american
history
in
our
public
schools
embraces
three
distinct
treatments
of
the
subject
three
separate
books
are
used
first
there
is
the
primary
book
which
is
usually
a
very
condensed
narrative
with
emphasis
on
biographies
and
anecdotes
second
there
is
the
advanced
text
for
the
seventh
or
eighth
grade
generally
speaking
an
expansion
of
the
elementary
book
by
the
addition
of
forty
or
fifty
thousand
words
finally
there
is
the
high
school
manual
this
too
ordinarily
follows
the
beaten
path
giving
fuller
accounts
of
the
same
events
and
characters
to
put
it
bluntly
we
do
not
assume
that
our
children
obtain
permanent
possessions
from
their
study
of
history
in
the
lower
grades
if
mathematicians
followed
the
same
method
high
school
texts
on
algebra
and
geometry
would
include
the
multiplication
table
and
fractions
there
is
of
course
a
ready
answer
to
the
criticism
advanced
above
it
is
that
teachers
have
learned
from
bitter
experience
how
little
history
their
pupils
retain
as
they
pass
along
the
regular
route
no
teacher
of
history
will
deny
this
still
it
is
a
standing
challenge
to
existing
methods
of
historical
instruction
if
the
study
of
history
can
not
be
made
truly
progressive
like
the
study
of
mathematics
science
and
languages
then
the
historians
assume
a
grave
responsibility
in
adding
their
subject
to
the
already
overloaded
curriculum
if
the
successive
historical
texts
are
only
enlarged
editions
of
the
first
text
more
facts
more
dates
more
words
then
history
deserves
most
of
the
sharp
criticism
which
it
is
receiving
from
teachers
of
science
civics
and
economics
in
this
condition
of
affairs
we
find
our
justification
for
offering
a
new
high
school
text
in
american
history
our
first
contribution
is
one
of
omission
the
stories
of
exploration
and
the
biographies
of
heroes
are
left
out
we
frankly
hold
that
if
pupils
know
little
or
nothing
about
columbus
cortes
magellan
or
captain
john
smith
by
the
time
they
reach
the
high
school
it
is
useless
to
tell
the
same
stories
for
perhaps
the
fourth
time
it
is
worse
than
useless
it
is
an
offense
against
the
teachers
of
those
subjects
that
are
demonstrated
to
be
progressive
in
character
in
the
next
place
we
have
omitted
all
descriptions
of
battles
our
reasons
for
this
are
simple
the
strategy
of
a
campaign
or
of
a
single
battle
is
a
highly
technical
and
usually
a
highly
controversial
matter
about
which
experts
differ
widely
in
the
field
of
military
and
naval
operations
most
writers
and
teachers
of
history
are
mere
novices
to
dispose
of
gettysburg
or
the
wilderness
in
ten
lines
or
ten
pages
is
equally
absurd
to
the
serious
student
of
military
affairs
any
one
who
compares
the
ordinary
textbook
account
of
a
single
civil
war
campaign
with
the
account
given
by
ropes
for
instance
will
ask
for
no
further
comment
no
youth
called
upon
to
serve
our
country
in
arms
would
think
of
turning
to
a
high
school
manual
for
information
about
the
art
of
warfare
the
dramatic
scene
or
episode
so
useful
in
arousing
the
interest
of
the
immature
pupil
seems
out
of
place
in
a
book
that
deliberately
appeals
to
boys
and
girls
on
the
very
threshold
of
serious
responsibilities
it
is
not
upon
negative
features
however
that
we
rest
our
case
it
is
rather
upon
constructive
features
we
have
written
a
topical
not
a
narrative
history
we
have
tried
to
set
forth
the
important
aspects
problems
and
movements
of
each
period
bringing
in
the
narrative
rather
by
way
of
illustration
we
have
emphasized
those
historical
topics
which
help
to
explain
how
our
nation
has
come
to
be
what
it
is
we
have
dwelt
fully
upon
the
social
and
economic
aspects
of
our
history
especially
in
relation
to
the
politics
of
each
period
we
have
treated
the
causes
and
results
of
wars
the
problems
of
financing
and
sustaining
armed
forces
rather
than
military
strategy
these
are
the
subjects
which
belong
to
a
history
for
civilians
these
are
matters
which
civilians
can
understand
matters
which
they
must
understand
if
they
are
to
play
well
their
part
in
war
and
peace
by
omitting
the
period
of
exploration
we
have
been
able
to
enlarge
the
treatment
of
our
own
time
we
have
given
special
attention
to
the
history
of
those
current
questions
which
must
form
the
subject
matter
of
sound
instruction
in
citizenship
we
have
borne
in
mind
that
america
with
all
her
unique
characteristics
is
a
part
of
a
general
civilization
accordingly
we
have
given
diplomacy
foreign
affairs
world
relations
and
the
reciprocal
influences
of
nations
their
appropriate
place
we
have
deliberately
aimed
at
standards
of
maturity
the
study
of
a
mere
narrative
calls
mainly
for
the
use
of
the
memory
we
have
aimed
to
stimulate
habits
of
analysis
comparison
association
reflection
and
generalization
habits
calculated
to
enlarge
as
well
as
inform
the
mind
we
have
been
at
great
pains
to
make
our
text
clear
simple
and
direct
but
we
have
earnestly
sought
to
stretch
the
intellects
of
our
readers
to
put
them
upon
their
mettle
most
of
them
will
receive
the
last
of
their
formal
instruction
in
the
high
school
the
world
will
soon
expect
maturity
from
them
their
achievements
will
depend
upon
the
possession
of
other
powers
than
memory
alone
the
effectiveness
of
their
citizenship
in
our
republic
will
be
measured
by
the
excellence
of
their
judgment
as
well
as
the
fullness
of
their
information

the
tide
of
migration
that
set
in
toward
the
shores
of
north
america
during
the
early
years
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
but
one
phase
in
the
restless
and
eternal
movement
of
mankind
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
ancient
greeks
flung
out
their
colonies
in
every
direction
westward
as
far
as
gaul
across
the
mediterranean
and
eastward
into
asia
minor
perhaps
to
the
very
confines
of
india
the
romans
supported
by
their
armies
and
their
government
spread
their
dominion
beyond
the
narrow
lands
of
italy
until
it
stretched
from
the
heather
of
scotland
to
the
sands
of
arabia
the
teutonic
tribes
from
their
home
beyond
the
danube
and
the
rhine
poured
into
the
empire
of
the
cæsars
and
made
the
beginnings
of
modern
europe
of
this
great
sweep
of
races
and
empires
the
settlement
of
america
was
merely
a
part
and
it
was
moreover
only
one
aspect
of
the
expansion
which
finally
carried
the
peoples
the
institutions
and
the
trade
of
europe
to
the
very
ends
of
the
earth
in
one
vital
point
it
must
be
noted
american
colonization
differed
from
that
of
the
ancients
the
greeks
usually
carried
with
them
affection
for
the
government
they
left
behind
and
sacred
fire
from
the
altar
of
the
parent
city
but
thousands
of
the
immigrants
who
came
to
america
disliked
the
state
and
disowned
the
church
of
the
mother
country
they
established
compacts
of
government
for
themselves
and
set
up
altars
of
their
own
they
sought
not
only
new
soil
to
till
but
also
political
and
religious
liberty
for
themselves
and
their
children
the
agencies
of
american
colonization
it
was
no
light
matter
for
the
english
to
cross
three
thousand
miles
of
water
and
found
homes
in
the
american
wilderness
at
the
opening
of
the
seventeenth
century
ships
tools
and
supplies
called
for
huge
outlays
of
money
stores
had
to
be
furnished
in
quantities
sufficient
to
sustain
the
life
of
the
settlers
until
they
could
gather
harvests
of
their
own
artisans
and
laborers
of
skill
and
industry
had
to
be
induced
to
risk
the
hazards
of
the
new
world
soldiers
were
required
for
defense
and
mariners
for
the
exploration
of
inland
waters
leaders
of
good
judgment
adept
in
managing
men
had
to
be
discovered
altogether
such
an
enterprise
demanded
capital
larger
than
the
ordinary
merchant
or
gentleman
could
amass
and
involved
risks
more
imminent
than
he
dared
to
assume
though
in
later
days
after
initial
tests
had
been
made
wealthy
proprietors
were
able
to
establish
colonies
on
their
own
account
it
was
the
corporation
that
furnished
the
capital
and
leadership
in
the
beginning
trading
english
pioneers
in
exploration
found
an
instrument
for
colonization
in
companies
of
merchant
adventurers
which
had
long
been
employed
in
carrying
on
commerce
with
foreign
countries
such
a
corporation
was
composed
of
many
persons
of
different
ranks
of
society
noblemen
merchants
and
gentlemen
who
banded
together
for
a
particular
undertaking
each
contributing
a
sum
of
money
and
sharing
in
the
profits
of
the
venture
it
was
organized
under
royal
authority
it
received
its
charter
its
grant
of
land
and
its
trading
privileges
from
the
king
and
carried
on
its
operations
under
his
supervision
and
control
the
charter
named
all
the
persons
originally
included
in
the
corporation
and
gave
them
certain
powers
in
the
management
of
its
affairs
including
the
right
to
admit
new
members
the
company
was
in
fact
a
little
government
set
up
by
the
king
when
the
members
of
the
corporation
remained
in
england
as
in
the
case
of
the
virginia
company
they
operated
through
agents
sent
to
the
colony
when
they
came
over
the
seas
themselves
and
settled
in
america
as
in
the
case
of
massachusetts
they
became
the
direct
government
of
the
country
they
possessed
the
stockholders
in
that
instance
became
the
voters
and
the
governor
the
chief

finally
under

of
william

certain
sense
georgia
may
be
included
among

company
colonies
it
was
however
originally
conceived
by
the
moving
spirit
james
oglethorpe
as
an
asylum
for
poor
men
especially
those
imprisoned
for
debt
to
realize
this
humane
purpose
he
secured
from
king
george
ii
in
a
royal
charter
uniting
several
gentlemen
including
himself
into
one
body
politic
and
corporate
known
as
the
trustees
for
establishing
the
colony
of
georgia
in
america
in
the
structure
of
their
organization

their
methods

the
trustees
did
not
differ
materially
from
the
regular
companies
created
for
trade
and
colonization
though
their
purposes
were
benevolent
their

a
second
agency
which
figured
largely
in
the
settlement
of
america
was
the
religious
brotherhood
or
congregation
of
men
and
women
brought
together
in
the
bonds
of
a
common
religious
faith
by
one
of
the
strange
fortunes
of
history
this
institution
founded
in
the
early
days
of
christianity
proved
to
be
a
potent
force
in
the
origin
and
growth
of
in
a
land
far
away
from
galilee
and
the
multitude
of
them
that
believed
were
of
one
heart
and
of
one
soul
we
are
told
in
the
acts
describing
the
church
at

we
are
knit
together
as
a
body
in
a
most
sacred
covenant
of
the
lord
by
virtue
of
which
we
hold
ourselves
strictly
tied
to
all
care
of
each
other
good

whole
wrote
john
robinson
a
leader
among
the
pilgrims
who
founded
their
tiny
colony
of
plymouth
in
the
mayflower
compact
so
famous
in
american
history
was
but
a
written
and
signed
agreement
incorporating
the
spirit
of
obedience
to
the
common
good
which
served
as
a
guide
to
until
plymouth
was
annexed
to
massachusetts
in

the
original
grants
three
other
colonies
all
of
which
retained
their

until
the
eve

sprang
directly
from
the
congregations
of
the
faithful
rhode
island
connecticut
and

hampshire
mainly
offshoots
from

they
were
founded
by
small
bodies
of
men
and
women
united
in
solemn
covenants
with
the
lord
who
planted
their
settlements
in

wilderness
not
until
many
a

anne

rhode

not
until
long
after
the
congregation
of
thomas
hooker
from
newtown
blazed

way
into
the
connecticut
river

did
the
king
of

give
connecticut
a
charter

a
third
and
very
important
colonial
agency
was
the

his
own
benefit
and
profit
with
the
right
to
hand
the
estate
down
to
his
heirs
in

powerful
person

capital
collect
the
ships
supply
the
stores
and
assemble
the
settlers
necessary
to
found
and
sustain
a
plantation
beyond

the

worked

sometimes
two
or
more
were

recognize

they
were
allowed
to
filter

treatment
they
received
there
varied

occasion

council
of

forbade
them
to
sell
by
retail

they
were
slowly
losing

pressed
in

colonization
considered
from
one
side
colonization
whatever
the
motives
of
the
emigrants
was
an
economic
matter
it
involved
the
use
of
capital
to
pay
for
their
passage
to
sustain
them
on
the
voyage
and
to
start
them
on
the

stern
economic
necessity

immigrants
to
america
in
colonial
days

capitalists
themselves
in

way
and
paid
their
own
passage
what
proportion
of
the
colonists
were
able
to
finance
their
voyage
across
the
sea
is
a
matter
of
pure
conjecture
undoubtedly
a
very
considerable
number
could
do
so
for
we
can
trace
the
family
fortunes
of
many
early
settlers

not
belong
to
the
classes
from
which
emigration
is
usually
supplied
for
they
all
had
a
stake
in
the
country
they
left
behind
though
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
how
accurate
this
statement
is
or
how
applicable
to
the
other
colonies
no
study
has
as
yet
been
made
to
gratify
that
interest
for
the
present
it
is
an
unsolved
problem
just
how
many
of
the
colonists
were
able
to
bear
the
cost
of
their
own
transfer
to
the
new
world
that
at
least
tens
of
thousands
of
immigrants
were
unable
to
pay
for
their
passage
is
established
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
by
the
shipping
records
that
have
come
down
to
us
the
great
barrier
in
the
way
of
the
poor
who
wanted
to
go
to
america
was
the
cost
of
the
sea
voyage
to
overcome
this
difficulty
a
plan
was
worked
out
whereby
shipowners
and
other
persons
of
means
furnished
the
passage
money
to
immigrants
in
return
for
their
promise
or
bond
to
work
for
a
term
of
years
to
repay
the
sum
advanced
this
system
was
called
indentured
servitude
it
is
probable
that
the
number
of
bond
servants
exceeded
the
original
twenty
thousand
puritans
the
yeomen
the
virginia
gentlemen
and
the
huguenots
combined
all
the
way
down
the
coast
from
massachusetts
to
georgia
were
to
be
found
in
the
fields
kitchens
and
workshops
men
women
and
children
serving
out
terms
of
bondage
generally
ranging
from
five
to
seven
years
in
the
proprietary
colonies
the
proportion
of
bond
servants
was
very
high
the
baltimores
penns
carterets
and
other
promoters
anxiously
sought
for
workers
of
every
nationality
to
till
their
fields
for
land
without
labor
was
worth
no
more
than
land
in
the
moon
hence
the
gates
of
the
proprietary
colonies
were
flung
wide
open
every
inducement
was
offered
to
immigrants
in
the
form
of
cheap
land
and
special
efforts
were
made
to
increase
the
population
by
importing
servants
in
pennsylvania
it
was
not
uncommon
to
find
a
master
with
fifty
bond
servants
on
his
estate
it
has
been
estimated
that
of
all
the
immigrants
into
pennsylvania
between
the
opening
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
were
in
bondage
in
the
other
middle
colonies
the
number
was
doubtless
not
so
large
but
it
formed
a
considerable
part
of
the
population
the
story
of
this
traffic
in
white
servants
is
one
of
the
most
striking
things
in
the
history
of
labor
bondmen
differed
from
the
serfs
of
the
feudal
age
in
that
they
were
not
bound
to
the
soil
but
to
the
master
they
likewise
differed
from
the
negro
slaves
in
that
their
servitude
had
a
time
limit
still
they
were
subject
to
many
special
disabilities
it
was
for
instance
a
common
practice
to
impose
on
them
penalties
far
heavier
than
were
imposed
upon
freemen
for
the
same
offense
a
free
citizen
of
pennsylvania
who
indulged
in
horse
racing
and
gambling
was
let
off
with
a
fine
a
white
servant
guilty
of
the
same
unlawful
conduct
was
whipped
at
the
post
and
fined
as
well
the
ordinary
life
of
the
white
servant
was
also
severely
restricted
a
bondman
could
not
marry
without
his
master
consent
nor
engage
in
trade
nor
refuse
work
assigned
to
him
for
an
attempt
to
escape
or
indeed
for
any
infraction
of
the
law
the
term
of
service
was
extended
the
condition
of
white
bondmen
in
virginia
according
to
lodge
was
little
better
than
that
of
slaves
loose
indentures
and
harsh
laws
put
them
at
the
mercy
of
their
masters
it
would
not
be
unfair
to
add
that
such
was
their
lot
in
all
other
colonies
their
fate
depended
upon
the
temper
of
their
masters
cruel
as
was
the
system
in
many
ways
it
gave
thousands
of
people
in
the
old
world
a
chance
to
reach
the
new
an
opportunity
to
wrestle
with
fate
for
freedom
and
a
home
of
their
own
when
their
weary
years
of
servitude
were
over
if
they
survived
they
might
obtain
land
of
their
own
or
settle
as
free
mechanics
in
the
towns
for
many
a
bondman
the
gamble
proved
to
be
a
losing
venture
because
he
found
himself
unable
to
rise
out
of
the
state
of
poverty
and
dependence
into
which
his
servitude
carried
him
for
thousands
on
the
contrary
bondage
proved
to
be
a
real
avenue
to
freedom
and
prosperity
some
of
the
best
citizens
of
america
have
the
blood
of
indentured
servants
in
their
veins
transported
involuntary
in
their
anxiety
to
secure
settlers
the
companies
and
proprietors
having
colonies
in
america
either
resorted
to
or
connived
at
the
practice
of
kidnapping
men
women
and
children
from
the
streets
of
english
cities
in
it
was
officially
estimated
that
ten
thousand
persons
were
spirited
away
to
america
many
of
the
victims
of
the
practice
were
young
children
for
the
traffic
in
them
was
highly
profitable
orphans
and
dependents
were
sometimes
disposed
of
in
america
by
relatives
unwilling
to
support
them
in
a
single
year
about
fifteen
hundred
children
were
shipped
to
virginia
in
this
gruesome
business
there
lurked
many
tragedies
and
very
few
romances
parents
were
separated
from
their
children
and
husbands
from
their
wives
hundreds
of
skilled
artisans
carpenters
smiths
and
weavers
utterly
disappeared
as
if
swallowed
up
by
death
a
few
thus
dragged
off
to
the
new
world
to
be
sold
into
servitude
for
a
term
of
five
or
seven
years
later
became
prosperous
and
returned
home
with
fortunes
in
one
case
a
young
man
who
was
forcibly
carried
over
the
sea
lived
to
make
his
way
back
to
england
and
establish
his
claim
to
a
peerage
akin
to
the
kidnapped
at
least
in
economic
position
were
convicts
deported
to
the
colonies
for
life
in
lieu
of
fines
and
imprisonment
the
americans
protested
vigorously
but
ineffectually
against
this
practice
indeed
they
exaggerated
its
evils
for
many
of
the
criminals
were
only
mild
offenders
against
unduly
harsh
and
cruel
laws
a
peasant
caught
shooting
a
rabbit
on
a
lord
estate
or
a
luckless
servant
girl
who
purloined
a
pocket
handkerchief
was
branded
as
a
criminal
along
with
sturdy
thieves
and
incorrigible

other
transported
offenders
were

african
rivaling
in
numbers
in
the
course
of
time
the
indentured
servants
and
whites
carried
to
america
against
their
will
were
the
african
negroes
brought
to
america
and
sold
into
slavery
when
this
form
of
bondage
was
first
introduced
into
virginia
in
it
was
looked
upon
as
a
temporary
necessity
to
be
discarded
with
the
increase
of
the
white
population
moreover
it
does
not
appear
that
those
planters
who
first
bought
negroes
at
the
auction
block
intended
to
establish
a
system
of
permanent
bondage
only
by
a
slow
process
did
chattel
slavery
take
firm
root
and
become
recognized
as
the
leading
source
of
the
labor
supply
in
thirty
years
after
the
introduction
of
slavery
there
were
only
three
hundred
africans
in
virginia
the
great
increase
in
later
years
was
due
in
no
small
measure
to
the
inordinate
zeal
for
profits
that
seized
slave
traders
both
in
old
and
in
new
england
finding
it
relatively
easy
to
secure
negroes
in
africa
they
crowded
the
southern
ports
with
their
vessels
the
english
royal
african
company
sent
to
america
annually
between
and
from
five
to
ten
thousand
slaves
the
ship
owners
of
new
england
were
not
far
behind
their
english
brethren
in
pushing
this
extraordinary
traffic
as
the
proportion
of
the
negroes
to
the
free
white
population
steadily
rose
and
as
whole
sections
were
overrun
with
slaves
and
slave
traders
the
southern
colonies
grew
alarmed
in
virginia
sought
to
curtail
the
importation
by
placing
a
duty
of
on
each
slave
this
effort
was
futile
for
the
royal
governor
promptly
vetoed
it
from
time
to
time
similar
bills
were
passed
only
to
meet
with
royal
disapproval
south
carolina
in
absolutely
prohibited
importation
but
the
measure
was
killed
by
the
british
crown
as
late
as
virginia
not
daunted
by
a
century
of
rebuffs
sent
to
george
iii
a
petition
in
this
vein
the
importation
of
slaves
into
the
colonies
from
the
coast
of
africa
hath
long
been
considered
as
a
trade
of
great
inhumanity
and
under
its
present
encouragement
we
have
too
much
reason
to
fear
will
endanger
the
very
existence
of
your
majesty
american
dominions
deeply
impressed
with
these
sentiments
we
most
humbly
beseech
your
majesty
to
remove
all
those
restraints
on
your
majesty
governors
of
this
colony
which
inhibit
their
assenting
to
such
laws
as
might
check
so
very
pernicious
a
commerce
all
such
protests
were
without
avail
the
negro
population
grew
by
leaps
and
bounds
until
on
the
eve
of
the
revolution
it
amounted
to
more
than
half
a
million
in
five
states
maryland
virginia
the
two
carolinas
and

the
slaves
nearly
equalled
or

exceeded
the
whites
in
number
in

they
formed
almost
of
the

even
in
the
middle

of
delaware
and

about
of
the
inhabitants
were
from
africa
to
the

the
proportion
of
slaves
steadily
diminished
although
chattel
servitude
was
on

legal
footing

in

in

approximately
one
in

were

the

the

unfavorable
to
the

still
slavery
though

was
a

northern

among

exercises
a
deep
influence
on
the
life
and
culture
of
a
people
the
feudal
and
aristocratic
societies
of
europe
were
founded
on
a
system
of
landlordism
which
was
characterized
by
two
distinct
features
in
the
first
place
the
land
was
nearly
all
held
in
great
estates
each
owned
by
a
single
proprietor
in
the
second
place
every
estate
was
kept
intact
under
the
law
of
primogeniture
which
at
the
death
of
a
lord
transferred
all
his
landed
property
to
his
eldest
son
this
prevented
the
subdivision
of
estates
and
the
growth
of
a
large
body
of
small
farmers
or
freeholders
owning
their
own
land
it
made
a
form
of
tenantry
or
servitude
inevitable
for
the
mass
of
those
who
labored
on
the
land
it
also
enabled
the
landlords
to
maintain
themselves
in
power
as
a
governing
class
and
kept
the
tenants
and
laborers
subject
to
their
economic
and
political
control
if
land
tenure
was
so
significant
in
europe
it
was
equally
important
in
the
development
of
america
where
practically
all
the
first
immigrants
were
forced
by
circumstances
to
derive
their
livelihood
from
the
soil
in
common
in
the
new
world
with
its
broad
extent
of
land
awaiting
the
white
man
plow
it
was
impossible
to
introduce
in
its
entirety
and
over
the
whole
area
the
system
of
lords
and
tenants
that
existed
across
the
sea
so
it
happened
that
almost
every
kind
of
experiment
in
land
tenure
from
communism
to
feudalism
was
tried
in
the
early
days
of
the
jamestown
colony
the
land
though
owned
by
the
london
company
was
tilled
in
common
by
the
settlers
no
man
had
a
separate
plot
of
his
own
the
motto
of
the
community
was
labor
and
share
alike
all
were
supposed
to
work
in
the
fields
and
receive
an
equal
share
of
the
produce
at
plymouth
the
pilgrims
attempted
a
similar
experiment
laying
out
the
fields
in
common
and
distributing
the
joint
produce
of
their
labor
with
rough
equality
among
the
workers
in
both
colonies
the
communistic
experiments
were
failures
angry
at
the
lazy
men
in
jamestown
who
idled
their
time
away
and
yet
expected
regular
meals
captain
john
smith
issued
a
manifesto
everyone
that
gathereth
not
every
day
as
much
as
i
do
the
next
day
shall
be
set
beyond
the
river
and
forever
banished
from
the
fort
and
live
there
or
starve
even
this
terrible
threat
did
not
bring
a
change
in
production
not
until
each
man
was
given
a
plot
of
his
own
to
till
not
until
each
gathered
the
fruits
of
his
own
labor
did
the
colony
prosper
in
plymouth
where
the
communal
experiment
lasted
for
five
years
the
results
were
similar
to
those
in
virginia
and
the
system
was
given
up
for
one
of
separate
fields
in
which
every
person
could
set
corn
for
his
own
particular
some
other
new
england
towns
refusing
to
profit
by
the
experience
of
their
plymouth
neighbor
also
made
excursions
into
common
ownership
and
labor
only
to
abandon
the
idea
and
go
in
for
individual
ownership
of
the
land
by
degrees
it
was
seen
that
even
the
lord
people
could
not
carry
the
complicated
communist
legislation
into
perfect
and
wholesome
practice
elements
in
the
colonies
quit
rents
manors
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale
were
the
feudal
elements
of
land
tenure
found
in
the
proprietary
colonies
in
the
seaboard
regions
of
the
south
and
to
some
extent
in
new
york
the
proprietor
was
in
fact
a
powerful
feudal
lord
owning
land
granted
to
him
by
royal
charter
he
could
retain
any
part
of
it
for
his
personal
use
or
dispose
of
it
all
in
large
or
small
lots
while
he
generally
kept
for
himself
an
estate
of

proportions
it
was

for
him

constant

and
it
became
a
formidable
item
in

long
list
of
grievances
which
led
to
the
american
revolution
something
still
more
like
the
feudal
system
of
the
old
world
appeared
in
the
numerous
manors
or
the
huge
landed
estates
granted
by
the
crown
the
companies
or
the
proprietors
in
the
colony
of
maryland
alone
there
were
sixty
manors
of
three
thousand
acres
each
owned
by
wealthy
men
and
tilled
by
tenants
holding
small
plots
under
certain
restrictions
of
tenure
in
new
york
also
there
were
many
manors
of
wide
extent
most
of
which
originated
in
the
days
of
the
dutch
west
india
company
when
extensive
concessions
were
made
to
patroons
to
induce
them
to
bring
over
settlers
the
van
rensselaer
the
van
cortlandt
and
the
livingston
manors
were
so
large
and
populous
that
each
was
entitled
to
send
a
representative
to
the
provincial
legislature
the
tenants
on
the
new
york
manors
were
in
somewhat
the
same
position
as
serfs
on
old
european
estates
they
were
bound
to
pay
the
owner
a
rent
in
money
and
kind
they
ground
their
grain
at
his
mill
and
they
were
subject
to
his
judicial
power
because
he
held
court
and
meted
out
justice
in
some
instances
extending
to
capital
punishment
the
manors
of
new
york
or
maryland
were
however
of
slight
consequence
as
compared
with
the
vast
plantations
of
the
southern
seaboard
huge
estates
far
wider
in
expanse
than
many
a
european
barony
and
tilled
by
slaves
more
servile
than
any
feudal
tenants
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
this
system
of
land
tenure
became
the
dominant
feature
of
a
large
section
and
gave
a
decided
bent
to
the
economic
and
political
life
of
america
illustration
southern

and

the
drift
was
against
all
forms
of
servitude
and
tenantry
and
in
the
direction
of
the
freehold
that
is
the
small
farm
owned
outright

by
the
possessor

his

this
was
favored
by
natural
circumstances
and
the
spirit
of
the
immigrants
for
one
thing
the
abundance
of
land
and
the
scarcity
of
labor
made
it
impossible
for
the
companies
the
proprietors
or
the
crown
to
develop
over
the
whole
continent
a
network
of
vast
estates
in
many
sections
particularly
in
new
england
the
climate
the
stony
soil
the
hills
and
the
narrow
valleys
conspired
to
keep
the
farms
within
a
moderate
compass
for
another
thing
the
english
and
german
peasants
even
if
they
had
been
tenants
in
the
old
world
did
not
propose
to
accept
permanent
dependency
of
any
kind
in
the
new
if
they
could
not
get
freeholds
they
would
not
settle
at
all
thus
they
forced
proprietors
and
companies
to
bid
for
their
enterprise
by
selling
land
in
small
lots
so
it
happened
that
the
freehold
of
modest
proportions
became
the
cherished
unit
of
american
farmers
the
people
who
tilled
the
farms
were
drawn
from
every

developed

types
of

pursuit
agriculture
they
had
a
common
tie
in
that
they
both
cultivated
the
soil
and
possessed
the
local
interest
and
independence
which
arise
from
that
occupation
their
methods
and
their
culture
however
differed
widely
the
southern
planter
on
his
broad
acres
tilled
by
slaves
resembled
the
english
landlord
on
his
estates
more
than
he
did
the
colonial
farmer
who
labored
with
his
own
hands
in
the
fields
and
forests
he
sold
his
rice
and
tobacco
in
large
amounts
directly
to

factors

took
his
entire
crop
in

for
goods

country
he
often
sent
his

to
oxford

cambridge

in
short
he
depended
very
largely
for
his
prosperity
and
his
enjoyment
of
life
upon
close
relations
with
the
old
world
he
did
not
even
need
market
towns
in
which
to
buy
native
goods
for
they
were
made
on
his
own
plantation
by
his
own
artisans
who
were
usually
gifted
slaves
the
economic
condition
of
the
small
farmer
was
totally
different
his
crops
were
not
big
enough
to
warrant
direct
connection
with
english
factors
or
the
personal
maintenance
of
a
corps
of

he
needed
local
markets
and
they
sprang
up
to
meet
the
need
smiths
hatters
weavers
and
potters

towns
supplied
him
with
the
rough
products
of
their
native
skill
the
finer
goods
bought
by
the
rich
planter
in
england
the
small
farmer
ordinarily
could
not
buy
his
wants
were
restricted
to
staples
like
tea
and
sugar
and
between
him
and
the
european
market
stood
the
merchant
his
community
was
therefore
more
than
the

it
was

had
employed
their
fine
woolen
cloth

foreign

come
to
look
upon
it
as
an
object
of
special
interest

protection

naturally
expected
to
maintain

monopoly

carried
this
most
perilous
mode
of
hard
industry
to
the
extent
to
which
it
has
been
pushed
by
this
recent
people
the
influence
of
the
business
was
widespread
a
large
and
lucrative
european
trade
was
built
upon
it
the
better
quality
of
the
fish
caught
for
food
was
sold
in
the
markets
of
spain
portugal
and
italy
or
exchanged
for
salt
lemons
and
raisins
for
the
american
market
the
lower
grades
of
fish
were
carried
to
the
west
indies
for
slave
consumption
and
in
part
traded
for
sugar
and
molasses
which
furnished
the
raw
materials
for
the
thriving
rum
industry
of
new
england
these
activities
in
turn
stimulated
shipbuilding
steadily
enlarging
the
demand
for
fishing
and
merchant
craft
of
every
kind
and
thus
keeping

of
the

collected
in
the
fish
markets
of
europe
and
the
west

the
colonists
paid
for
english
manufactures
so
an
circle
of

centered
around
this
single

a
modern
historian
has
said
the
enterprising
merchants
of

developed
a
network
of
trade
routes
that
covered
half
the

this

destined
to
be
of
such
significance
in
the
conflict
with
the

seems
perhaps
trivial
that
however
is
not
the
test
of
its
significance
it
must
be
considered
in
relation
to
the
growth
of
english
colonial
trade
in
its
entirety
a
relation
which
can
be
shown
by
a
few
startling
figures
the
whole
export
trade
of
england
including
that
to
the
colonies
was
in
on
the
eve
of
the
american
revolution
namely
in
english
exports
to
the
american
colonies
alone
amounted
to
in
other
words
almost
as
much
as
the
whole
foreign
business
of

two
generations
before
at

in
to
almost
the
entire

trade
of

to

at
the
opening
of
the
century
the
american
colonies
were
indeed
a
great
source
of
wealth
to
english
merchants
although
the
bad
roads
of
colonial
times
made
overland
transportation
difficult
and
costly
the
many
rivers
and

along
the
coast
favored
a
lively
trade
among
the

the

rivers
in

it

they
had
gathered

of

where
they
were

there
were

and

with
this

there
grew
up
along

and
yet
poor

meager
as
the

may

by

after

the

in

assumed
a
rôle
of
high
importance
there
were
abundant
reasons
for
this
in
many
of
the
colonies
maryland
pennsylvania
and
new
england
the
religious
impulse
had
been
one
of
the
impelling
motives
in
stimulating
immigration
in
all
the
colonies
the
clergy
at
least
in
the
beginning
formed
the
only
class
with
any
leisure
to
devote
to
matters
of
the
spirit
they
preached
on
sundays
and
taught
school
on
week
days
they
led
in
the
discussion
of
local
problems
and
in
the
formation
of
political
opinion
so
much
of
which
was
concerned
with
the
relation
between

and

they
wrote
books
and

they
filled
most
of
the
chairs
in
the
colleges
under
clerical
guidance
intellectual
and
spiritual
the
americans
received
their
formal
education
in
several
of
the
provinces
the
anglican
church
was
established
by

in
new
england
the
puritans
were
supreme
notwithstanding
the
efforts
of
the
crown
to
overbear
their
authority
in
the
middle
colonies
particularly
the
multiplication
of
sects
made
the
dominance
of
any
single
denomination
impossible
and
in
all
of
them
there
was
a
growing
diversity
of
faith
which
promised
in
time
a
separation
of
church
and
state
and
freedom
of
opinion
church
of
virginia
was
the
stronghold
of
the
english
system
of
church
and
state
the
anglican
faith
and
worship
were
prescribed
by
law
sustained
by
taxes
imposed
on
all
and
favored
by
the
governor
the
provincial
councilors
and
the
richest
planters
the
established
church
says
lodge
was
one
of
the
appendages
of
the
virginia
aristocracy
they
controlled
the
vestries
and
the
ministers
and
the
parish
church
stood
not
infrequently
on
the
estate
of
the
planter
who
built
and
managed
it
as
in
england
catholics
and
protestant
dissenters
were
at
first
laid
under
heavy
disabilities
only
slowly
and
on
sufferance
were
they
admitted
to
the
province
but
when
once
they
were
even
covertly
tolerated
they
pressed
steadily
in
until
by
the
revolution
they
outnumbered
the
adherents
of
the
established
order
the
church
was
also
sanctioned
by
law
and
supported
by
taxes
in
the
carolinas
after
and
in
georgia
after
that
colony
passed
directly
under
the
crown
in
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
were
dissenters
against
the
protests
of
the
catholics
it
was
likewise
established
in
maryland
in
new
york
too
notwithstanding
the
resistance
of
the
dutch
the
established
church
was
fostered
by
the
provincial
officials
and
the
anglicans
embracing
about
of
the
population
exerted
an
influence
all
out
of
proportion
to
their
numbers
many
factors
helped
to
enhance
the
power
of
the
english
church
in
the
colonies
it
was
supported
by
the
british
government
and
the
official
class
sent
out
to
the
provinces
its
bishops
and
archbishops
in
england
were
appointed
by
the
king
and
its
faith
and
service
were
set
forth
by
acts
of
parliament
having
its
seat
of
power
in
the
english
monarchy
it
could
hold
its
clergy
and
missionaries
loyal
to
the
crown
and
so
counteract
to
some
extent
the
independent
spirit
that
was
growing
up
in
america
the
church
always
a
strong
bulwark
of
the
state
therefore
had
a
political
rôle
to
play
here
as
in
england
able
bishops
and
leaders
firmly
grasped
this
fact
about
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
redoubled
their
efforts
to
augment
the
influence
of
the
church
in
provincial
affairs
unhappily
for
their
plans
they
failed
to
calculate
in
advance
the
effect
of
their
methods
upon
dissenting
protestants
who
still
cherished
memories
of
bitter
religious
conflicts
in
the
mother
country
in
new
if
the
established
faith
made
for
imperial
unity
the
same
could
not
be
said
of
puritanism
the
plymouth
pilgrims
had
cast
off
all
allegiance
to
the
anglican
church
and
established
a
separate
and
independent
congregation
before
they
came
to
america
the
puritans
essaying
at
first
the
task
of
reformers
within
the
church
soon
after
their
arrival
in
massachusetts
likewise
flung
off
their
yoke
of
union
with
the
anglicans
in
each
town
a
separate
congregation
was
organized
the
male
members
choosing
the
pastor
the
teachers
and
the
other
officers
they
also
composed
the
voters
in
the
town
meeting
where
secular
matters
were
determined
the
union
of
church
and
government
was
thus
complete
and
uniformity
of
faith
and
life
prescribed
by
law
and
enforced
by
civil
authorities
but
this
worked
for
local
autonomy
instead
of
imperial
unity
the
clergy
became
a
powerful
class
dominant
through
their
learning
and
their
fearful
denunciations
of
the
faithless
they
wrote
the
books
for
the
people
to
read
the
famous
cotton
mather
having
three
hundred
and
books
and
pamphlets
to
his
credit
in
coöperation
with
the
civil
officers
they
enforced
a
strict
observance
of
the

sunday
evening
and
was
luckless
enough
to
have
a
ray
of
light
strike
him
through
a
rift
in
the
clouds
the
next
day
he
was
brought
into
court
and
fined
for
his
ungodly
conduct
with
persons
accused
of
witchcraft
the
puritans
were
still
more
ruthless
when
a
mania
of
persecution
swept
over
massachusetts
in
eighteen
people
were
hanged
one
was
pressed
to
death
many
suffered
imprisonment
and
two
died
in
jail
just
about
this
time
however
there
came
a
break
in
the
uniformity
of
puritan
rule
the
crown
and
church
in
england
had
long
looked
upon
it
with
disfavor
and
in
king
charles
ii
annulled
the
old
charter
of
the
massachusetts
bay
company
a
new
document
issued
seven
years
later
wrested
from
the
puritans
of
the
colony
the
right
to
elect
their
own
governor
and
reserved
the
power
of
appointment
to
the
king
it
also
abolished
the
rule
limiting
the
suffrage
to
church
members
substituting
for
it
a
simple
property
qualification
thus
a
royal
governor
and
an
official
family
certain
to
be
episcopalian
in
faith
and
monarchist
in
sympathies
were
forced
upon
massachusetts
and
members
of
all
religious
denominations
if
they
had
the
required
amount
of
property
were
permitted
to
take
part
in
elections
by
this
act
in
the
name
of
the
crown
the
puritan
monopoly
was
broken
down
in
massachusetts
and
that
province
was
brought
into
line
with
connecticut
rhode
island
and
new
hampshire
where
property
not
religious
faith
was
the
test
for
the
suffrage
of
religious
though
neither
the
anglicans
of
virginia
nor
the
puritans
of
massachusetts
believed
in
toleration
for
other
denominations
that
principle
was
strictly
applied
in
rhode
island
there
under
the
leadership
of
roger
williams
liberty
in
matters
of
conscience
was
established
in
the
beginning
maryland
by
granting
in
freedom
to
those
who
professed
to
believe
in
jesus
christ
opened
its
gates
to
all
christians
and
pennsylvania
true
to
the
tenets
of
the
friends
gave
freedom
of
conscience
to
those
who
confess
and
acknowledge
the
one
almighty
and
eternal
god
to
be
the
creator
upholder
and
ruler
of
the
world
by
one
circumstance
or
another
the
middle
colonies
were
thus
early
characterized
by
diversity
rather
than
uniformity
of
opinion
dutch
protestants
huguenots
quakers
baptists
presbyterians
new
lights
moravians
lutherans
catholics
and
other
denominations
became
too
strongly
intrenched
and
too
widely
scattered
to
permit
any
one
of
them
to
rule
if
it
had
desired
to
do
so
there
were
communities
and
indeed
whole
sections
where
one
or
another
church
prevailed
but
in
no
colony
was
a
legislature
steadily
controlled
by
a
single
group
toleration
encouraged
diversity
and
diversity
in
turn
worked
for
greater
toleration
the
government
and
faith
of
the
dissenting
denominations
conspired
with
economic
and
political
tendencies
to
draw
america
away
from
the
english
state
presbyterians
quakers
baptists
and
puritans
had
no
hierarchy
of
bishops
and
archbishops
to
bind
them
to
the
seat
of
power
in
london
neither
did
they
look
to
that
metropolis
for
guidance
in
interpreting
articles
of
faith
local
in
matters
ecclesiastical
helped
to
train
them
for
local
in
matters
political
the
spirit
of
independence
which
led
dissenters
to
revolt
in
the
old
world
nourished
as
it
was
amid
favorable
circumstances
in
the
new
world
made
them
all
the
more
zealous
in
the
defense
of
every
right
against
authority
imposed
from
without
schools
and
colleges
and
local
one
of
the
first
cares
of
each
protestant
denomination
was
the
education
of
the
children
in
the
faith
in
this
work
the
bible
became
the
center
of
interest
the
english
version
was
indeed
the
one
book
of
the
people
farmers
shopkeepers
and
artisans
whose
life
had
once
been
bounded
by
the
daily
routine
of
labor
found
in
the
scriptures
not
only
an
inspiration
to
religious
conduct
but
also
a
book
of
romance
travel
and
history
legend
and
annal
says
john
richard
green
and
psalm
and
biography
the
mighty
voices
of

the
parables
of
evangelists
stories
of
mission
journeys
of
perils
by
sea
and
among
the
heathen
philosophic
arguments
apocalyptic
visions
all
were
flung
broadcast
over
minds
unoccupied
for
the
most
part
by
any
rival
learning
as
a
mere
literary
monument
the
english
version
of
the
bible
remains
the
noblest
example
of
the
english
tongue
it
was
the
king
james
version
just
from
the
press
that
the
pilgrims
brought
across
the
sea
with
them
for
the
authority
of
the
established
church
was
substituted
the
authority
of
the
scriptures
the
puritans
devised
a
catechism
based
upon
their
interpretation
of
the
bible
and
very
soon
after
their
arrival
in
america
they
ordered
all
parents
and
masters
of
servants
to
be
diligent
in
seeing
that
their
children
and
wards
were
taught
to
read
religious
works
and
give
answers
to
the
religious
questions
massachusetts
was
scarcely
twenty
years
old
before
education
of
this
character
was
declared
to
be
compulsory
and
provision
was
made
for
public
schools
where
those
not
taught
at
home
could
receive
instruction
in
reading
and
writing

the
idea
of
compulsory
education
was
not
regarded
with
the
same
favor
but
the
whole
land
was
nevertheless
dotted
with
little
schools
kept
by
dames
itinerant
teachers
or
local
parsons
whether
we
turn
to
the

of
franklin

we

tiny
schoolhouses
where

and
sometimes

were
taught

there
were
no

fathers
and
mothers
of
the
better
kind
gave
their
children
the
rudiments
of
learning
though
illiteracy
was
widespread
there
is
evidence
to
show
that
the
diffusion
of
knowledge
among
the
masses
was
making
steady
progress
all
through
the
eighteenth
century
and
higher
religious
motives
entered
into
the
establishment
of
colleges
as
well
as
local
schools
harvard
founded
in
and
yale
opened
in

intended
primarily
to
train
learned

godly

organized
by
benjamin
franklin
reflected
the
spirit
of
toleration
by
giving
representation
on
the
board
of
trustees
to
several
religious
sects
it
was
franklin
idea
that
his
college
should
prepare
young
men
to
serve
in
public
office
as
leaders
of
the
people
and
ornaments
to
their
country
in
important
as
were
these
institutions
of
learning
higher
education
was
by
no
means
confined
within
their
walls
many
families
sent
their
sons
to
oxford
or
cambridge
in
england
private
tutoring
in
the
home
was
common
in
still
more
families
there
were
intelligent
children
who
grew
up
in
the
great
colonial
school
of
adversity
and
who
trained
themselves
until
in
every
contest
of
mind
and
wit
they
could
vie
with
the
sons
of
harvard
or
william
and
mary
or
any
other
college
such
for
example
was
benjamin
franklin
whose
charming
autobiography
in
addition
to
being
an
american
classic
is
a
fine
record
of
his
formal
training
in
the
classroom
was
limited
to
a
few
years
at
a
local
school
in
boston
but
his
continued
throughout
his
life
he
early
manifested
a
zeal
for
reading
and
devoured
he
tells
us
his
father
dry
library
on
theology
bunyan
works
defoe
writings
plutarch
the
human
and
innumerable
volumes
dealing
with
secular
subjects
his
literary
style
perhaps
the
best
of
his
time
franklin
acquired
by
the
diligent
and
repeated
analysis
of
the
in
a
life
crowded
with
labors
he
found
time
to
read
widely
in
natural
science
and
to
win
recognition
at
the
hands
of
european
savants
for
his
discoveries
in
electricity
by
his
own
efforts
he
attained
an
acquaintance
with
latin
italian
french
and
spanish
thus
unconsciously
preparing
himself
for
the
day
when
he
was
to
speak
for
all
america
at
the
court
of
the
king
of
france
lesser
lights
than
franklin
educated
by
the
same
process
were
found
all
over
colonial
america
from
this
fruitful
source
of
native
ability
the
american
cause
drew
great
strength
in
the
trials
of

the
colonial
press
rise
of
the
the
evolution
of
american
democracy
into
a
government
by
public
opinion
enlightened
by
the
open
discussion
of
political
questions
was
in
no
small
measure
aided
by
a
free
press
that
too
like
education
was
a
matter
of
slow
growth
a
printing
press
was
brought
to
massachusetts
in
but
it
was
put
in
charge
of
an
official
censor
and
limited
to
the
publication
of
religious
works
forty
years
elapsed
before
the
first
newspaper
appeared
bearing
the
curious
title
occurrences
both
foreign
and
and
it
had
not
been
running
very
long
before
the
government
of
massachusetts
suppressed
it
for
discussing
a
political
question
publishing
indeed
seemed
to
be
a
precarious
business
but
in
there
came
a
second
venture
in
journalism
boston
which
proved
to
be
a
more
lasting
enterprise
because
it
refrained
from
criticizing
the
authorities
still
the
public
interest
languished
when
franklin
brother
james
began
to
issue
his
england
about
his
friends
sought
to
dissuade
him
saying
that
one
newspaper
was
enough
for
america
nevertheless
he
continued
it
and
his
confidence
in
the
future
was
rewarded
in
nearly
every
colony
a
gazette
or
chronicle
appeared
within
the
next
thirty
years
or
more
benjamin
franklin
was
able
to
record
in
that
america
had
newspapers
boston
led
with
five
philadelphia
had
three
two
in
english
and
one
in
german
and
restraints
on
the
the
idea
of
printing
unlicensed
by
the
government
and
uncontrolled
by
the
church
was
however
slow
in
taking
form
the
founders
of
the
american
colonies
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
have
the
free
and
open
publication
of
books
pamphlets
broadsides
and
newspapers
when
the
art
of
printing
was
first
discovered
the
control
of
publishing
was
vested
in
clerical
authorities
after
the
establishment
of
the
state
church
in
england
in
the
reign
of
elizabeth
censorship
of
the
press
became
a
part
of
royal
prerogative
printing
was
restricted
to
oxford
cambridge
and
london
and
no
one
could
publish
anything
without
previous
approval
of
the
official
censor
when
the
puritans
were
in
power
the
popular
party
with
a
zeal
which
rivaled
that
of
the
crown
sought
in
turn
to
silence
royalist
and
clerical
writers
by
a
vigorous
censorship
after
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
control
of
the
press
was
once
more
placed
in
royal
hands
where
it
remained
until
when
parliament
by
failing
to
renew
the
licensing
act
did
away
entirely
with
the
official
censorship
by
that
time
political
parties
were
so
powerful
and
so
active
and
printing
presses
were
so
numerous
that
official
review
of
all
published
matter
became
a
sheer
impossibility
in
america
likewise
some
troublesome
questions
arose
in
connection
with
freedom
of
the
press
the
puritans
of
massachusetts
were
no
less
anxious
than
king
charles
or
the
archbishop
of
london
to
shut
out
from
the
prying
eyes
of
the
people
all
literature
not
mete
for
them
to
read
and
so
they
established
a
system
of
official
licensing
for
presses
which
lasted
until
in
the
other
colonies
where
there
was
more
diversity
of
opinion
and
publishers
could
set
up
in
business
with
impunity
they
were
nevertheless
constantly
liable
to
arrest
for
printing
anything
displeasing
to
the
colonial
governments
in
the
editor
of
the
in
philadelphia
was
called
before
the
proprietary
council
and
ordered
to
apologize
for
a
political
article
and
for
a
later
offense
of
a
similar
character
he
was
thrown
into
jail
a
still
more
famous
case
was
that
of
peter
zenger
a
new
york
publisher
who
was
arrested
in
for
criticising
the
administration
lawyers
who
ventured
to
defend
the
unlucky
editor
were
deprived
of
their
licenses
to
practice
and
it
became
necessary
to
bring
an
attorney
all
the
way
from
philadelphia
by
this
time
the
tension
of
feeling
was
high
and
the
approbation
of
the
public
was
forthcoming
when
the
lawyer
for
the
defense
exclaimed
to
the
jury
that
the
very
cause
of
liberty
itself
not
that
of
the
poor
printer
was
on
trial
the
verdict
for
zenger
when
it
finally
came
was
the
signal
for
an
outburst
of
popular
rejoicing
already
the
people
of
king
george
province
knew
how
precious
a
thing
is
the
freedom
of
the
press
thanks
to
the
schools
few
and
scattered
as
they
were
and
to
the
vigilance
of
parents
a
very
large
portion
perhaps
nearly
of
the
colonists
could
read
through
the
newspapers
pamphlets
and
almanacs
that
streamed
from
the
types
the
people
could
follow
the
course
of
public
events
and
grasp
the
significance
of
political
arguments
an
american
opinion
was
in
the
process
of
making
an
independent
opinion
nourished
by
the
press
and
enriched
by
discussions
around
the
fireside
and
at
the
taverns
when
the
day
of
resistance
to
british
rule
came
government
by
opinion
was
at
hand
for
every
person
who
could
hear
the
voice
of
patrick
henry
and
samuel
adams
there
were
a
thousand
who
could
see
their
appeals
on
the
printed
page

who

spelled

poring
over

two
very
distinct
lines
of
development

in
colonial
politics
the
one
exalting
royal
rights
and
aristocratic
privileges
was
the
drift
toward
provincial
government
through
royal
officers
appointed
in
england
the
other
leading
toward
democracy
and
was
the
growth
in
the
power
of
the
popular
legislative
assembly
each
movement
gave
impetus
to
the
other
with
increasing
force
during
the
passing
years
until
at
last
the
final
collision
between
the
two
ideals
of

the
colonial
governors
were
generally
surrounded
by
a
body
of
and
hunters
for
land
grants
some
of
them
were
noblemen
of
broken
estates
who
had
come
to
america
to
improve
their
fortunes
the
pretensions
of
this
circle
grated
on
colonial
nerves
and
privileges
granted
to
them
often
at
the
expense
of
colonists
did
much
to
deepen
popular
antipathy
to
the
british

displeased
dissenters
the
reappearance
of
this
formidable
union
of
church
and
state
from
which
they
had
fled
stirred
anew
the
ancient
wrath
against
that
combination
colonial
coincident
with
the
drift
toward
administration
through
royal
governors
was
the
second
and
opposite
tendency
namely
a
steady
growth
in
the
practice
of
the
voters
of
england
had
long
been
accustomed
to
share
in
taxation
and
through
representatives
in
parliament
and
the
idea
was
early
introduced
in
america
virginia
was
only
twelve
years
old
when
its
first
representative
assembly
appeared
as
the
towns
of
massachusetts
multiplied
and
it
became
impossible
for
all
the
members
of
the
corporation
to
meet
at
one
place
the
representative
idea
was
adopted
in
the
river
towns
of
connecticut
formed
a
representative
system
under
their
fundamental
orders
of
and
the
entire
colony
was
given
a
royal
charter
in
generosity
as
well
as
practical
considerations
induced
such
proprietors
as
lord
baltimore
and
william
penn
to
invite
their
colonists
to
share
in
the
government
as
soon
as
any
considerable
settlements
were
made
thus
by
one
process
or
another
every
one
of
the
colonies
secured
a
popular
assembly
it
is
true
that
in
the
provision
for
popular
elections
the
suffrage
was
finally
restricted
to
property
owners
or
taxpayers
with
a
leaning
toward
the
freehold
qualification
in
virginia
the
rural
voter
had
to
be
a
freeholder
owning
at
least
fifty
acres
of
land
if
there
was
no
house
on
it
or
acres
with
a
house
feet
square
in
massachusetts
the
voter
for
member
of
the
assembly
under
the
charter
of
had
to
be
a
freeholder
of
an
estate
worth
forty
shillings
a
year
at
least
or
of
other
property
to
the
value
of
forty
pounds
sterling
in
pennsylvania
the
suffrage
was
granted
to
freeholders
owning
fifty
acres
or
more
of
land
well
seated
twelve
acres
cleared
and
to
other
persons
worth
at
least
fifty
pounds
in
lawful
money
restrictions
like
these
undoubtedly
excluded
from
the
suffrage
a
very
considerable
number
of
men
particularly
the
mechanics
and
artisans
of
the
towns
who
were
by
no
means
content
with
their
position
nevertheless
it
was
relatively
easy
for
any
man
to
acquire
a
small
freehold
so
cheap
and
abundant
was
land
and
in
fact
a
large
proportion
of
the
colonists
were
land
owners
thus
the
assemblies
in
spite
of
the
limited
suffrage
acquired
a
democratic
tone
the
popular
character
of
the
assemblies
increased
as
they
became
engaged
in
battles
with
the
royal
and
proprietary
governors
when
called
upon
by
the
executive
to
make
provision
for
the
support
of
the
administration
the
legislature
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
make
terms
in
the
interest
of
the
taxpayers
it
made
annual
not
permanent
grants
of
money
to
pay
official
salaries
and
then
insisted
upon
electing
a
treasurer
to
dole
it
out
thus
the
colonists
learned
some
of
the
mysteries
of
public
finance
as
well
as
the
management
of
rapacious
officials
the
legislature
also
used
its
power
over
money
grants
to
force
the
governor
to
sign
bills
which
he
would
otherwise
have
vetoed
between
legislatures
and
as
may
be
imagined
many
and
bitter
were
the
contests
between
the
royal
and
proprietary
governors
and
the
colonial
assemblies
franklin
relates
an
amusing
story
of
how
the
pennsylvania
assembly
held
in
one
hand
a
bill
for
the
executive
to
sign
and
in
the
other
hand
the
money
to
pay
his
salary
then
with
sly
humor
franklin
adds
do
not
my
courteous
reader
take
pet
at
our
proprietary
constitution
for
these
our
bargain
and
sale
proceedings
in
legislation
it
is
a
happy
country
where
justice
and
what
was
your
own
before
can
be
had
for
ready
money
it
is
another
addition
to
the
value
of
money
and
of
course
another
spur
to
industry
every
land
is
not
so
blessed
it
must
not
be
thought
however
that
every
governor
got
off
as
easily
as
franklin
tale
implies
on
the
contrary
the
legislatures
like
cæsar
fed
upon
meat
that
made
them
great
and
steadily
encroached
upon
executive
prerogatives
as
they
tried
out
and
found
their
strength
if
we
may
believe
contemporary
laments
the
power
of
the
crown
in
america
was
diminishing
when
it
was
struck
down
altogether
in

is
by

not
civil
posts
only
but
all
ecclesiastical
preferments
are
in
the
disposal
or
election
of
the
people
though
baffled
by
the
levelling
principles
of
the
colonial
assemblies
the
governors
did
not
give
up
the
case
as
hopeless
instead
they
evolved
a
system
of
policy
and
action
which
they
thought
could
bring
the
obstinate
provincials
to
terms
that
system
traceable
in
their
letters
to
the
government
in
london
consisted
of
three
parts
the
royal
officers
in
the
colonies
were
to
be
made
independent
of
the
legislatures
by
taxes
imposed
by
acts
of
parliament
a
british
standing
army
was
to
be
maintained
in
america
the
remaining
colonial
charters
were
to
be
revoked
and
government
by
direct
royal
authority
was
to
be
enlarged
such
a
system
seemed
plausible
enough
to
king
george
iii
and
to
many
ministers
of
the
crown
in
london
with
governors
courts
and
an
army
independent
of
the
colonists
they
imagined
it
would
be
easy
to
carry
out
both
royal
orders
and
acts
of
parliament
this
reasoning
seemed
both
practical
and
logical
nor
was
it
founded
on
theory
for
it
came
fresh
from
the
governors
themselves
it
was
wanting
in
one
respect
only
it
failed
to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
the
american
people
were

of

the
answer
it

admitted
was
far
from
satisfactory
to

the
conduct
of

was
far
from

but
thousands
of

got
a
taste
a
strong
taste

the
french

expensive

sustained
only
by

outlays

came
both
england

staggering
under

to
make
matters
worse
there
was
a
fall

a
commercial
depression

extended
over

in

difficult
to
estimate

british
statesmen
regarded
it
as
a
happy
circumstance

the

already
restive
under
their
administration
had
no
foreign
power
at

france
though
defeated
was
not
out

as

proved
it

it
was
neither
the

was
the
product
of
the
long
strife

culminated

of
the
the
struggles
between
charles

and

and
the
turmoil
of
the
puritan
régime
so
engrossed
the
attention
of
englishmen
at
home
that
they
had
little
time
to
think
of
colonial
policies
or
to
interfere
with
colonial
affairs
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
in
accompanied
by
internal
peace
and
the
increasing
power
of
the
mercantile
classes
in

house

changed
all
that
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
himself
an
person
the
policy
of
regulating
trade
by
act
of
parliament
was
developed
into
a
closely
knit
system
and
powerful
agencies
to
supervise
the
colonies
were
created
at
the
same
time
a
system
of
stricter
control
over
the
dominions
was
ushered
in
by
the
annulment
of
the
old
charter
of
massachusetts
which
conferred
so
much
on
the
puritans
charles
successor
james
ii
a
man
of
sterner
stuff
and
jealous
of
his
authority
in
the
colonies
as
well
as
at
home
continued
the
policy
thus
inaugurated
and
enlarged
upon
it
if
he
could
have
kept
his
throne
he
would
have
bent
the
americans
under
a
harsh
rule
or
brought
on
in
his
dominions
a
revolution
like
that
which
he
precipitated
at
home
in
he
determined
to
unite
the
northern
colonies
and
introduce
a
more
efficient
administration
based
on
the
pattern
of
the
royal
provinces
he
made
a
martinet
sir
edmund
andros
governor
of
all
new
england
new
york
and
new
jersey
the
charter
of
massachusetts
annulled
in
the
last
days
of
his
brother
reign
he
continued
to
ignore
and
that
of
connecticut
would
have
been
seized
if
it
had
not
been
spirited
away
and
hidden
according
to
tradition
in
a
hollow
oak
for
several
months
andros
gave
the
northern
colonies
a
taste
of
despotism
he
wrung
quit
rents
from
land
owners
not
accustomed
to
feudal
dues
he
abrogated
titles
to
land
where
in
his
opinion
they
were
unlawful
he
forced
the
episcopal
service
upon
the
old
south
church
in
boston
and
he
denied
the
writ
of
to
a
preacher
who
denounced
taxation
without
representation
in
the
middle
of
his
arbitrary
course
however
his
hand
was
stayed
the
news
came
that
king
james
had
been
dethroned
by
his
angry
subjects
and
the
people
of
boston
kindling
a
fire
on
beacon
hill
summoned
the
countryside
to
dispose
of
andros
the
response
was
prompt
and
hearty
the
hated
governor
was
arrested
imprisoned
and
sent
back
across
the
sea
under
guard
the
overthrow
of
james
followed
by
the
accession
of
william
and
mary
and
by
assured
parliamentary
supremacy
had
an
immediate
effect
in
the
colonies
the
new
order
was
greeted
with
thanksgiving
massachusetts
was
given
another
charter
which
though
not
so
liberal
as
the
first
restored
the
spirit
if
not
the
entire
letter
of
in
the
other
colonies
where
andros
had
been
operating
the
old
course
of
affairs
was
resumed

of
the
first
two
on
the
death
in
of
queen
anne
the
successor
of
king
william
the
throne
passed
to
a
hanoverian
prince
who
though
grateful
for
english
honors
and
revenues
was
more
interested
in
hanover
than
in
england
george
i
and
george
ii
whose
combined
reigns
extended
from
to
never
even
learned
to
speak
the
english
language
at
least
without
an
accent
the
necessity
of
taking
thought
about
colonial
affairs
bored
both
of
them
so
that
the
stoutest
defender
of
popular
privileges
in
boston
or
charleston
had
no
ground
to
complain
of
the
exercise
of
personal
prerogatives
by
the
king
moreover
during
a
large
part
of
this
period
the
direction
of
affairs
was
in
the
hands
of
an
astute
leader
sir
robert
walpole
who
betrayed
his
somewhat
cynical
view
of
politics
by
adopting
as
his
motto
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
he
revealed
his
appreciation
of
popular
sentiment
by
exclaiming
i
will
not
be
the
minister
to
enforce
taxes
at
the
expense
of
blood
such
kings
and
such
ministers
were
not
likely
to
arouse
the
slumbering
resistance
of
the
thirteen
colonies
across
the
sea
of
the
crown
over
the
while
no
english
ruler
from
james
ii
to
george
iii
ventured
to
interfere
with
colonial
matters
personally
constant
control
over
the
colonies
was
exercised
by
royal
officers
acting
under
the
authority
of
the
crown
systematic
supervision
began
in
when
there
was
created
by
royal
order
a
committee
of
the
king
council
to
meet
on
mondays
and
thursdays
of
each
week
to
consider
petitions
memorials
and
addresses
respecting
the
plantations
in
a
regular
board
was
established
known
as
the
lords
of
trade
and
plantations
which
continued
until
the
american
revolution
to
scrutinize
closely
colonial
business
the
chief
duties
of
the
board
were
to
examine
acts
of
colonial
legislatures
to
recommend
measures
to
those
assemblies
for
adoption
and
to
hear
memorials
and
petitions
from
the
colonies
relative
to
their
affairs
the
methods
employed
by
this
board
were
varied
all
laws
passed
by
american
legislatures
came
before
it
for
review
as
a
matter
of
routine
if
it
found
an
act
unsatisfactory
it
recommended
to
the
king
the
exercise
of
his
veto
power
known
as
the
royal
disallowance
any
person
who
believed
his
personal
or
property
rights
injured
by
a
colonial
law
could
be
heard
by
the
board
in
person
or
by
attorney
in
such
cases
it
was
the
practice
to
hear
at
the
same
time
the
agent
of
the
colony
so
involved
the
royal
veto
power
over
colonial
legislation
was
not
therefore
a
formal
affair
but
was
constantly
employed
on
the
suggestion
of
a
highly
efficient
agency
of
the
crown
all
this
was
in
addition
to
the
powers
exercised
by
the
governors
in
the
royal
provinces
supplementing
this
administrative
control
over
the
colonies
was
a
constant
supervision
by
the
english
courts
of
law
the
king
by
virtue
of
his
inherent
authority
claimed
and
exercised
high
appellate
powers
over
all
judicial
tribunals
in
the
empire
the
right
of
appeal
from
local
courts
expressly
set
forth
in
some
charters
was
on
the
eve
of
the
revolution
maintained
in
every
colony
any
subject
in
england
or
america
who
in
the
regular
legal
course
was
aggrieved
by
any
act
of
a
colonial
legislature
or
any
decision
of
a
colonial
court
had
the
right
subject
to
certain
regulations
to
carry
his
case
to
the
king
in
council
forcing
his
opponent
to
follow
him
across
the
sea
in
the
exercise
of
appellate
power
the
king
in
council
acting
as
a
court
could
and
frequently
did
declare
acts
of
colonial
legislatures
duly
enacted
and
approved
null
and
void
on
the
ground
that
they
were
contrary
to
english
law
control
in
day
after
day
week
after
week
year
after
year
the
machinery
for
political
and
judicial
control
over
colonial
affairs
was
in
operation
at
one
time
the
british
governors
in
the
colonies
were
ordered
not
to
approve
any
colonial
law
imposing
a
duty
on
european
goods
imported
in
english
vessels
again
when
north
carolina
laid
a
tax
on
peddlers
the
council
objected
to
it
as
restrictive
upon
the
trade
and
dispersion
of
english
manufactures
throughout
the
continent
at
other
times
indian
trade
was
regulated
in
the
interests
of
the
whole

or
grants
of
lands

a
colonial
legislature

set

virginia
was
forbidden
to
close
her
ports
to
north
carolina
lest
there
should
be
retaliation
in
short
foreign
and
intercolonial
trade
were
subjected
to
a
control
higher
than
that
of
the
colony
foreshadowing
a
day
when
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
to
commit
to
congress
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
and
commerce
with
the
indians
a
superior
judicial
power
towering
above
that
of
the
colonies
as
the
supreme
court
at
washington
now
towers
above

states
kept
the
colonial
legislatures
within
the
metes
and
bounds
of
established
law
in
the
thousands
of
appeals
memorials
petitions
and
complaints
and
the
rulings
and
decisions
upon
them
were
written
the
real
history
of
british
imperial
control
over
the
american
colonies
so
great
was
the
business
before
the
lords
of
trade
that
the
colonies
had
to
keep
skilled
agents
in
london
to
protect
their
interests
as
common
grievances
against
the
operation
of
this
machinery
of
control
arose
there
appeared
in
each
colony
a
considerable
body
of
men
with
the
merchants
in
the
lead
who
chafed
at
the
restraints
imposed
on
their
enterprise
only
a
powerful
blow
was
needed
to
weld
these
bodies
into
a
common
mass
nourishing
the
spirit
of
colonial
nationalism
when
to
the
repeated
minor
irritations
were
added
general
and
sweeping
measures
of
parliament
applying
to
every
colony
the
rebound
came
in
the
revolution
control
over
colonial
as
soon
as
parliament
gained
in
power
at
the
expense
of
the
king
it
reached
out
to
bring
the
american
colonies
under
its
sway
as
well
between
the
execution
of
charles
i
and
the
accession
of
george
iii
there
was
enacted
an
immense
body
of
legislation
regulating
the
shipping
trade
and
manufactures
of
america
all
of
it
based
on
the
mercantile
theory
then
prevalent
in
all
countries
of
europe
was
designed
to
control
the
overseas
plantations
in
such
a
way
as
to
foster
the
commercial
and
business
interests
of
the
mother
country
where
merchants
and
men
of
finance
had
got
the
upper
hand
according
to
this
theory
the
colonies
of
the
british
empire
should
be
confined
to
agriculture
and
the
production
of
raw
materials
and
forced
to
buy
their
manufactured
goods
of
england
navigation
in
the
first
rank
among
these
measures
of
british
colonial
policy
must
be
placed
the
navigation
laws
framed
for
the
purpose
of
building
up
the
british
merchant
marine
and
navy
arms
so
essential
in
defending
the
colonies
against
the
spanish
dutch
and
french
the
beginning
of
this
type
of
legislation
was
made
in
and
it
was
worked
out
into
a
system
early
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
the
navigation
acts
in
effect
gave
a
monopoly
of
colonial
commerce
to
british
ships
no
trade
could
be
carried
on
between
great
britain
and
her
dominions
save
in
vessels
built
and
manned
by
british
subjects
no
european
goods
could
be
brought
to
america
save
in
the
ships
of
the
country
that
produced
them
or
in
english
ships
these
laws
which
were
almost
fatal
to
dutch
shipping
in
america
fell
with
severity
upon
the
colonists
compelling
them
to
pay
higher
freight
rates
the
adverse
effect
however
was
for
the
measures
stimulated
shipbuilding
in
the
colonies
where
the
abundance
of
raw
materials
gave
the
master
builders
of
america
an
advantage
over
those
of
the
mother
country
thus
the
colonists
in
the
end
profited
from
the
restrictive
policy
written
into
the
navigation
acts
acts
against
the
second
group
of
laws
was
deliberately
aimed
to
prevent
colonial
industries
from
competing
too
sharply
with
those
of
england
among
the
earliest
of
these
measures
may
be
counted
the
woolen
act
of
forbidding
the
exportation
of
woolen
goods
from
the
colonies
and
even
the
woolen
trade
between
towns
and
colonies
when
parliament
learned
as
the
result
of
an
inquiry
that
new
england
and
new
york
were
making
thousands
of
hats
a
year
and
sending
large
numbers
annually
to
the
southern
colonies
and
to
ireland
spain
and
portugal
it
enacted
in
a
law
declaring
that
no
hats
or
felts
dyed
or
undyed
finished
or
unfinished
should
be
put
upon
any
vessel
or
laden
upon
any
horse
or
cart
with
intent
to
export
to
any
place
whatever
the
effect
of
this
measure
upon
the
hat
industry
was
almost
ruinous
a
few
years
later
a
similar
blow
was
given
to
the
iron
industry
by
an
act
of
pig
and
bar
iron
from
the
colonies
were
given
free
entry
to
england
to
encourage
the
production
of
the
raw
material
but
at
the
same
time
the
law
provided
that
no
mill
or
other
engine
for
slitting
or
rolling
of
iron
no
plating
forge
to
work
with
a
tilt
hammer
and
no
furnace
for
making
steel
should
be
built
in
the
colonies
as
for
those
already
built
they
were
declared
public
nuisances
and
ordered
closed
thus
three
important
economic
interests
of
the
colonists
the
woolen
hat
and
iron
industries
were
laid
under
the
ban
trade
the
third
group
of
restrictive
measures
passed
by
the
british
parliament
related
to
the
sale
of
colonial
produce
an
act
of
required
the
colonies
to
export
certain
articles
to
great
britain
or
to
her
dominions
alone
while
sugar
tobacco
and
ginger
consigned
to
the
continent
of
europe
had
to
pass
through
a
british
port
paying
custom
duties
and
through
a
british
merchant
hands
paying
the
usual
commission
at
first
tobacco
was
the
only
one
of
the
enumerated
articles
which
seriously
concerned
the
american
colonies
the
rest
coming
mainly
from
the
british
west
indies
in
the
course
of
time
however
other
commodities
were
added
to
the
list
of
enumerated
articles
until
by
it
embraced
rice
naval
stores
copper
furs
hides
iron
lumber
and
pearl
ashes
this
was
not
all
the
colonies
were
compelled
to
bring
their
european
purchases
back
through
english
ports
paying
duties
to
the
government
and
commissions
to
merchants
again
molasses
not
content
with
laws
enacted
in
the
interest
of
english
merchants
and
manufacturers
parliament
sought
to
protect
the
british
west
indies
against
competition
from
their
french
and
dutch
neighbors
new
england
merchants
had
long
carried
on
a
lucrative
trade
with
the
french
islands
in
the
west
indies
and
dutch
guiana
where
sugar
and
molasses
could
be
obtained
in
large
quantities
at
low
prices
acting
on
the
protests
of
english
planters
in
the
barbadoes
and
jamaica
parliament
in
passed
the
famous
molasses
act
imposing
duties
on
sugar
and
molasses
imported
into
the
colonies
from
foreign
countries
rates
which
would
have
destroyed
the
american
trade
with
the
french
and
dutch
if
the
law
had
been
enforced
the
duties
however
were
not
collected
the
molasses
and
sugar
trade
with
the
foreigners
went
on
merrily
smuggling
taking
the
place
of
lawful
traffic
of
the
laws
in
as
compared
with
the
strict
monopoly
of
her
colonial
trade
which
spain
consistently
sought
to
maintain
the
policy
of
england
was
both
moderate
and
liberal
furthermore
the
restrictive
laws
were
supplemented
by
many
measures
intended
to
be
favorable
to
colonial
prosperity
the
navigation
acts
for
example
redounded
to
the
advantage
of
american
shipbuilders
and
the
producers
of
hemp
tar
lumber
and
ship
stores
in
general
favors
in
british
ports
were
granted
to
colonial
producers
as
against
foreign
competitors
and
in
some
instances
bounties
were
paid
by
england
to
encourage
colonial
enterprise
taken
all
in
all
there
is
much
justification
in
the
argument
advanced
by
some
modern
scholars
to
the
effect
that
the
colonists
gained
more
than
they
lost
by
british
trade
and
industrial
legislation
certainly
after
the
establishment
of
independence
when
free
from
these
old
restrictions
the
americans
found
themselves
handicapped
by
being
treated
as
foreigners
rather
than
favored
traders
and
the
recipients
of
bounties
in
english
markets
be
that
as
it
may
it
appears
that
the
colonists
felt
little
irritation
against
the
mother
country
on
account
of
the
trade
and
navigation
laws
enacted
previous
to
the
close
of
the
french
and
indian
war
relatively
few
were
engaged
in
the
hat
and
iron
industries
as
compared
with
those
in
farming
and
planting
so
that
england
policy
of
restricting
america
to
agriculture
did
not
conflict
with
the
interests
of
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
the
woolen
industry
was
largely
in
the
hands
of
women
and
carried
on
in
connection
with
their
domestic
duties
so
that
it
was
not
the
sole
support
of
any
considerable
number
of
people
as
a
matter
of
fact
moreover
the
restrictive
laws
especially
those
relating
to
trade
were
not
rigidly
enforced
cargoes
of
tobacco
were
boldly
sent
to
continental
ports
without
even
so
much
as
a
bow
to
the
english
government
to
which
duties
should
have
been
paid
sugar
and
molasses
from
the
french
and
dutch
colonies
were
shipped
into
new
england
in
spite
of
the
law
royal
officers
sometimes
protested
against
smuggling
and
sometimes
connived
at
it
but
at
no
time
did
they
succeed
in
stopping
it
taken
all
in
all
very
little
was
heard
of
the
galling
restraints
of
trade
until
after
the
french
war
when
the
british
government
suddenly
entered
upon
a
new
course
summary
of
the
colonial
period
in
the
period
between
the
landing
of
the
english
at
jamestown
virginia
in
and
the
close
of
the
french
and
indian
war
in
a
period
of
a
century
and
a
half
a
new
nation
was
being
prepared
on
this
continent
to
take
its
place
among
the
powers
of
the
earth
it
was
an
epoch
of
migration
western
europe
contributed
emigrants
of
many
races
and
nationalities
the
english
led
the
way
next
to
them
in
numerical
importance
were
the
and
the
germans
into
the
melting
pot
were
also
cast
dutch
swedes
french
jews
welsh
and
irish
thousands
of
negroes
were
brought
from
africa
to
till
southern
fields
or
labor
as
domestic
servants
in
the
north
why
did
they
come
the
reasons
are
various
some
of
them
the
pilgrims
and
puritans
of
new
england
the
french
huguenots
and
irish
and
the
catholics
of
maryland
fled
from
intolerant
governments
that
denied
them
the
right
to
worship
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
consciences
thousands
came
to
escape
the
bondage
of
poverty
in
the
old
world
and
to
find
free
homes
in
america
thousands
like
the
negroes
from
africa
were
dragged
here
against
their
will
the
lure
of
adventure
appealed
to
the
restless
and
the
lure
of
profits
to
the
enterprising
merchants
how
did
they
come
in
some
cases
religious
brotherhoods
banded
together
and
borrowed
or
furnished
the
funds
necessary
to
pay
the
way
in
other
cases
great
trading
companies
were
organized
to
found
colonies
again
it
was
the
wealthy
proprietor
like
lord
baltimore
or
william
penn
who
undertook
to
plant
settlements
many
immigrants
were
able
to
pay
their
own
way
across
the
sea
others
bound
themselves
out
for
a
term
of
years
in
exchange
for
the
cost
of
the
passage
negroes
were
brought
on
account
of
the
profits
derived
from
their
sale
as
slaves
whatever
the
motive
for
their
coming
however
they
managed
to
get
across
the
sea
the
immigrants
set
to
work
with
a
will
they
cut
down
forests
built
houses
and
laid
out
fields
they
founded
churches
schools
and
colleges
they
set
up
forges
and
workshops
they
spun
and
wove
they
fashioned
ships
and
sailed
the
seas
they
bartered
and
traded
here
and
there
on
favorable
harbors
they
established
centers
of
commerce
boston
providence
new
york
philadelphia
baltimore
and
charleston
as
soon
as
a
firm
foothold
was
secured
on
the
shore
line
they
pressed
westward
until
by
the
close
of
the
colonial
period
they
were
already
on
the
crest
of
the
alleghanies
though
they
were
widely
scattered
along
a
thousand
miles
of
seacoast
the
colonists
were
united
in
spirit
by
many
common
ties
the
major
portion
of
them
were
protestants
the
language
the
law
and
the
literature
of
england
furnished
the
basis
of
national
unity
most
of
the
colonists
were
engaged
in
the
same
hard
task
that
of
conquering
a
wilderness
to
ties
of
kinship
and
language
were
added
ties
created
by
necessity
they
had
to
unite
in
defense
first
against
the
indians
and
later
against
the
french
they
were
all
subjects
of
the
same
sovereign
the
king
of
england
the
english
parliament
made
laws
for
them
and
the
english
government
supervised
their
local
affairs
their
trade
and
their
manufactures
common
forces
assailed
them
common
grievances
vexed
them
common
hopes
inspired
them
many
of
the
things
which
tended
to
unite
them
likewise
tended
to
throw
them
into
opposition
to
the
british
crown
and
parliament
most
of
them
were
freeholders
that
is
farmers
who
owned
their
own
land
and
tilled
it
with
their
own
hands
a
free
soil
nourished
the
spirit
of
freedom
the
majority
of
them
were
dissenters
critics
not
friends
of
the
church
of
england
that
stanch
defender
of
the
british
monarchy
each
colony
in
time
developed
its
own
legislature
elected
by
the
voters
it
grew
accustomed
to
making
laws
and
laying
taxes
for
itself
here
was
a
people
learning
and
the
attempts
to
strengthen
the
church
of
england
in
america
and
the
transformation
of
colonies
into
royal
provinces
only
fanned
the
spirit
of
independence
which
they
were
designed
to
quench
nevertheless
the
americans
owed
much
of
their
prosperity
to
the
assistance
of
the
government
that
irritated
them
it
was
the
protection
of
the
british
navy
that
prevented
holland
spain
and
france
from
wiping
out
their
settlements
though
their
manufacture
and
trade
were
controlled
in
the
interests
of
the
mother
country
they
also
enjoyed
great
advantages
in
her
markets
free
trade
existed
nowhere
upon
the
earth
but
the
broad
empire
of
britain
was
open
to
american
ships
and
merchandise
it
could
be
said
with
good
reason
that
the
disadvantages
which
the
colonists
suffered
through
british
regulation
of
their
industry
and
trade
were
more
than
offset
by
the
privileges
they
enjoyed
still
that
is
somewhat
beside
the
point
for
mere
economic
advantage
is
not
necessarily
the
determining
factor
in
the
fate
of
peoples
a
thousand
circumstances
had
helped
to
develop
on

a

and

george

had
been
spoiled
by

his
tutors
and
his
courtiers
under
their
influence
he
developed
high
and
mighty
notions
about
the
sacredness
of
royal
authority
and
his
duty
to
check
the
pretensions
of
parliament
and
the

his
mother
had
dinned
into
his
ears
the
slogan
george

king
lord

his
teacher

adviser
had
told
him
that
his
honor
required
him
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
shaping
of
public
policy
and
the
making
of
laws
thus
educated
he
surrounded
himself
with
courtiers
who
encouraged
him
in
the
determination
to
rule
as
well
as
reign
to
subdue
all
parties
and
to
place

of

were
composed

of

had
as
a
consequence
raised
up
many
enemies
in

their

had
by
this
time
given
up
all
hope
of
restoring

they
still
cherished
their

coveted
opportunity
came
to
them
to
rally
around

at

time
made
smooth
the
way
for
the
king
and
his
allies
with
their
designs
for
controlling
the
entire
government
in
the
first
place
the
house
of
lords
was
composed
mainly
of
hereditary
nobles
whose
number
the
king
could
increase
by
the
appointment
of
his
favorites
as
of
old
though
the
members
of
the
house
of
commons
were
elected
by
popular
vote
they
did
not
speak
for
the
mass
of
english
people
great
towns
like
leeds
manchester
and
birmingham
for
example
had
no
representatives
at
all
while
there
were
about
eight
million
inhabitants
in
great

there
were
in
only
about
voters
that
is
to
say
only
about
one
in

ten
adult
males

a
voice
in

many
boroughs
returned
one

more
members
to
the
commons
although
they
had
merely
a
handful
of
voters
or
in
some
instances
no
voters
at
all
furthermore
these
tiny
boroughs
were
often
controlled
by
lords
who
openly
sold
the
right
of
representation
to
the
highest
bidder
the
as
they
were
called
by
reformers
were
a
public
scandal

george

readily
made

the

treating
him
with
gross
incivility
and
the
crowds
shouting

forever
the
direction
of
affairs
was
entrusted
to
men
enjoying
the
confidence
leadership
in
the
house
of
commons
fell
to
george
grenville
a
grave
and
laborious
man
who
for
years
had
groaned
over
the
increasing
cost
of
government
the
first
task
after
the
conclusion
of
peace
in
was
the
adjustment
of
the
disordered
finances
of
the
kingdom
the
debt
stood
at
the
highest
point
in
the
history
of
the
country
more
revenue
was
absolutely
necessary
and
grenville
began
to
search
for
it
turning
his
attention
finally
to
the
american
colonies
in
this
quest
he
had
the
aid
of
a
zealous
colleague
charles
townshend
who
had
long
been
in
public
service
and
was
familiar
with
the
difficulties
encountered
by
royal
governors
in
america
these
two
men
with
the
support
of
the
entire
ministry
inaugurated
in
february
a
new
system
of
colonial
government
it
was
announced
by
authority
that
there
were
to
be
no
more
requisitions
from
the
king
to
the
colonial
assemblies
for
supplies
but
that
the
colonies
were
to
be
taxed
instead
by
act
of
parliament
colonial
governors
and
judges
were
to
be
paid
by
the
crown
they
were
to
be
supported
by
a
standing
army
of
twenty
regiments
and
all
the
expenses
of
this
force
were
to
be
met
by
parliamentary
taxation
of
paper
money
among
the
many
complaints
filed
before
the
board
of
trade
were
vigorous
protests
against
the
issuance
of
paper
money
by
the
colonial
legislatures
the
new
ministry
provided
a
remedy
in
the
act
of
which
declared
void
all
colonial
laws
authorizing
paper
money
or
extending
the
life
of
outstanding
bills
this
law
was
aimed
at
the
cheap
money
which
the
americans
were
fond
of
making
when
specie
was
scarce
money
which
they
tried
to
force
on
their
english
creditors
in
return
for
goods
and
in
payment
of
the
interest
and
principal
of
debts
thus
the
first
chapter
was
written
in
the
long
battle
over
sound
money
on
this
continent
on
western
land
later
in
the
same
year
george
iii
issued
a
royal
proclamation
providing
among
other
things
for
the
government
of
the
territory
recently
acquired
by
the
treaty
of
paris
from
the
french
one
of
the
provisions
in
this
royal
decree
touched
frontiersmen
to
the
quick
the
contests
between
the
officers
and
the
colonists
over
the
disposition
of
western
lands
had
been
long
and
sharp
the
americans
chafed
at
restrictions
on
settlement
the
more
adventurous
were
continually
moving
west
and
squatting
on
land
purchased
from
the
indians
or
simply
seized
without
authority
to
put
an
end
to
this
the
king
forbade
all
further
purchases
from
the
indians
reserving
to
the
crown
the
right
to
acquire
such
lands
and
dispose
of
them
for
settlement
a
second
provision
in
the
same
proclamation
vested
the
power
of
licensing
trade
with
the
indians
including
the
lucrative
fur
business
in
the
hands
of
royal
officers
in
the
colonies
these
two
limitations
on
american
freedom
and
enterprise
were
declared
to
be
in
the
interest
of
the
crown
and
for
the
preservation
of
the
rights
of
the
indians
against
fraud
and
abuses
sugar
act
of
king
george
ministers
next
turned
their
attention
to
measures
of
taxation
and
trade
since
the
heavy
debt
under
which
england
was
laboring
had
been
largely
incurred
in
the
defense
of
america
nothing
seemed
more
reasonable
to
them
than
the
proposition
that
the
colonies
should
help
to
bear
the
burden
which
fell
so
heavily
upon
the
english
taxpayer
the
sugar
act
of
was
the
result
of
this
reasoning
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
purpose
of
this
law
for
it
was
set
forth
clearly
in
the
title
an
act
for
granting
certain
duties
in
the
british
colonies
and
plantations
in
america
for
applying
the
produce
of
such
duties
towards
defraying
the
expenses
of
defending
protecting
and
securing
the
said
colonies
and
plantations
and
for
more
effectually
preventing
the
clandestine
conveyance
of
goods
to
and
from
the
said
colonies
and
plantations
and
improving
and
securing
the
trade
between
the
same
and
great
britain
the
old
molasses
act
had
been
prohibitive
the
sugar
act
of
was
clearly
intended
as
a
revenue
measure
specified
duties
were
laid
upon
sugar
indigo
calico
silks
and
many
other
commodities
imported
into
the
colonies
the
enforcement
of
the
molasses
act
had
been
utterly
neglected
but
this
sugar
act
had
teeth
in
it
special
precautions
as
to
bonds
security
and
registration
of
ship
masters
accompanied
by
heavy
penalties
promised
a
vigorous
execution
of
the
new
revenue
law
the
strict
terms
of
the
sugar
act
were
strengthened
by
administrative
measures
under
a
law
of
the
previous
year
the
commanders
of
armed
vessels
stationed
along
the
american
coast
were
authorized
to
stop
search
and
on
suspicion
seize
merchant
ships
approaching
colonial
ports
by
supplementary
orders
the
entire
british
official
force
in
america
was
instructed
to
be
diligent
in
the
execution
of
all
trade
and
navigation
laws
revenue
collectors
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
and
royal
governors
were
curtly
ordered
to
the
front
to
do
their
full
duty
in
the
matter
of
law
enforcement
the
ordinary
motives
for
the
discharge
of
official
obligations
were
sharpened
by
an
appeal
to
avarice
for
naval
officers
who
seized
offenders
against
the
law
were
rewarded
by
large
prizes
out
of
the
forfeitures
and
penalties

the
combination
moved
steadily
towards
its
goal

the

act
was
under
consideration
in
parliament
grenville
announced
a
plan
for
a
stamp
bill
the
next
year
it
went
through
both
houses
with
a
speed
that
must
have
astounded
its
authors
the
vote
in
the
commons
stood
in
favor
to
against
while
in
the
lords
it
was
not
even
necessary
to
go
through
the
formality
of
a
count
as
george
iii
was
temporarily
insane
the
measure
received
royal
assent
by
a
commission
acting
as
a
board
of

protests
of
colonial
agents
in

were
futile

might
as
well
have
hindered
the
sun

exclaimed
franklin
protests
of
a
few
opponents
in
the
commons
were
equally
vain
the
ministry
was
firm
in
its
course
and
from
all
appearances
the
stamp
act
hardly
roused
as
much
as
a
languid
interest
in
the
city
of
london
in
fact
it
is
recorded
that
the
fateful
measure
attracted
less
notice
than
a
bill
providing
for
a
commission
to
act
for
the
king
when
he
was
incapacitated

of

to

in
america
towards
defraying
the
expenses
of
defending
protecting
and
securing

was
a
long
measure
of
more
than
fifty

drawn

that

they
could

was
being
debated
a

exclaimed

of

the

greeted
in

by
an
outburst
of
denunciation
the
merchants
of

cities
took
the
lead
in
making
a
dignified
but
unmistakable
protest
agreeing
not
to

british
goods
while
the
hated

stood
upon
the
books

some
of
them
incensed
at
the
heavy
taxes
on
their
operations
and
others
intimidated
by
patriots
who
refused
to
permit
them
to
use
stamped
papers
joined
with
the
merchants
aristocratic
colonial
whigs
who
had
long
grumbled
at
the
administration
of
royal
governors
protested
against
taxation
without
their
consent
as
the
whigs
had
done
in
old
england
there
were
tories
however
in
the
colonies
as
in
england
many
of
them
of
the
official
class
who
denounced
the
merchants
lawyers
and
whig
aristocrats
as
seditious
factious
and
republican
yet
the
opposition
to
the
stamp
act
and
its
accompanying
measure
the
quartering
act
grew
steadily
all
through
the
summer
of
in
a
little
while
it
was
taken
up
in
the
streets
and
along
the
countryside
all
through
the
north
and
in
some
of
the
southern
colonies
there
sprang
up
as
if
by
magic
committees
and
societies
pledged
to
resist
the
stamp
act
to
the
bitter
end
these
popular
societies
were
known
as
sons
of
liberty
and
daughters
of
liberty
the
former
including
artisans
mechanics
and
laborers
and
the
latter
patriotic
women
both
groups
were
alike
in
that
they
had
as
yet
taken
little
part
in
public
affairs
many
artisans
as
well
as
all
the
women
were
excluded
from
the
right
to
vote
for
colonial
assemblymen
while
the
merchants
and
whig
gentlemen
confined
their
efforts
chiefly
to
drafting
protests
against
british
measures
the
sons
of
liberty
operated
in
the
streets
and
chose
rougher
measures
they
stirred
up
riots
in
boston
new

philadelphia
and
charleston
when
attempts
were
made
to
sell
the
stamps
they
sacked
and
burned
the
residences
of
high
royal
officers
they
organized
committees
of
inquisition
who
by
threats
and
intimidation
curtailed
the
sale
of
british
goods
and
the
use
of
stamped
papers
in
fact
the
sons
of
liberty
carried
their
operations
to
such
excesses
that
many
mild
opponents
of
the
stamp
tax
were
frightened
and
drew
back
in
astonishment
at
the
forces
they
had
unloosed
the
daughters
of

in
a
quieter
way

protected
by
this
country
and
pay
no
part
of
the
expenses
the
answer
was
brief
that
is
not
the
case
the
colonies
raised
clothed
and
paid
during
the
last
war
thousand
men
and
spent
many
millions
then
came
an
inquiry
whether
the
colonists
would
accept
a
modified
stamp
act
no
never
replied
franklin
never
they
will
never
submit
to
it
it
was
next
suggested
that
military
force
might
compel
obedience
to
law
franklin
had
a
ready
answer
they
can
not
force
a
man
to
take
stamps
they
may
not
find
a
rebellion
they
may
indeed
make
one
the
repeal
of
the
stamp
act
was
moved
in
the
house
of
commons
a
few
days
later
the
sponsor
for
the
repeal
spoke
of
commerce
interrupted
debts
due

merchants
placed

the

pitt
and
edmund
burke
the
former
near
the
close
of
his
career
the
latter
just
beginning
his
argued
cogently
in
favor
of
retracing
the
steps
taken
the
year
before
grenville
refused
america
must
learn
he
wailed
that
prayers
are
not
to
be
brought
to
cæsar
through
riot
and
sedition
his
protests
were
idle
the
commons
agreed
to
the
repeal
on
february
amid
the
cheers
of
the
victorious
majority
it
was
carried
through
the
lords
in
the
face
of
strong
opposition
and
on
march
reluctantly
signed
by
the
king
now
restored
to
his
right
mind
in
rescinding
the
stamp
act
parliament
did
not
admit
the
contention
of
the
americans
that
it
was
without
power
to
tax
them
on
the
contrary
it
accompanied
the
repeal
with
a
declaratory
act
it
announced
that
the
colonies
were
subordinate
to
the
crown
and
parliament
of
great
britain
that
the
king
and
parliament
therefore
had
undoubted
authority
to
make
laws
binding
the
colonies
in
all
cases
whatsoever
and
that
the
resolutions
and
proceedings
of
the
colonists
denying
such
authority
were
null
and
void
the
repeal
was
greeted
by
the
colonists
with
great
popular
demonstrations
bells
were
rung
toasts
to
the
king
were
drunk
and
trade
resumed
its
normal
course
the
declaratory
act
as
a
mere
paper
resolution
did
not
disturb
the
good
humor
of
those
who
again
cheered
the
name
of
king
george
their
confidence
was
soon
strengthened
by
the
news
that
even
the
sugar
act
had
been
repealed
thus
practically
restoring
the
condition
of
affairs
before
grenville
and
townshend
inaugurated
their
policy
of
thoroughness
resumption
of
british
revenue
and
commercial
policies
townshend
acts
the
triumph
of
the
colonists
was
brief
though
pitt
the
friend
of
america
was
once
more
prime
minister
and
seated
in
the
house
of
lords
as
the
earl
of
chatham
his
severe
illness
gave
to
townshend
and
the
tory
party
practical
control
over
parliament
unconvinced
by
the
experience
with
the
stamp
act
townshend
brought
forward
and
pushed
through
both
houses
of
parliament
three
measures
which
to
this
day
are
associated
with
his
name
first
among
his
restrictive
laws
was
that
of
june
which
placed
the
enforcement
of
the
collection
of
duties
and
customs
on
colonial
imports
and
exports
in
the
hands
of
british
commissioners
appointed
by
the
king
resident
in
the
colonies
paid
from
the
british
treasury
and
independent
of
all
control
by
the
colonists
the
second
measure
of
the
same
date
imposed
a
tax
on
lead
glass
paint
tea
and
a
few
other
articles
imported
into
the
colonies
the
revenue
derived
from
the
duties
to
be
applied
toward
the
payment
of
the
salaries
and
other
expenses
of
royal
colonial
officials
a
third
measure
was
the
tea
act
of
july
aimed
at
the
tea
trade
which
the
americans
carried
on
illegally
with
foreigners
this
law
abolished
the
duty
which
the
east
india
company
had
to
pay
in
england
on
tea
exported
to
america
for
it
was
thought
that
english
tea
merchants
might
thus
find
it
possible
to
undersell
american
tea
smugglers
of
assistance
legalized
by
had
parliament
been
content
with
laying
duties
just
as
a
manifestation
of
power
and
right
and
neglected
their
collection
perhaps
little
would
have
been
heard
of
the
townshend
acts
it
provided
however
for
the
strict
even
the
harsh
enforcement
of
the
law
it
ordered
customs
officers
to
remain
at
their
posts
and
put
an
end
to
smuggling
in
the
revenue
act
of
june
it
expressly
authorized
the
superior
courts
of
the
colonies
to
issue
writs
of
assistance
empowering
customs
officers
to
enter
any
house
warehouse
shop
cellar
or
other
place
in
the
british
colonies
or
plantations
in
america
to
search
for
and
seize
prohibited
or
smuggled
goods
the
writ
of
assistance
which
was
a
general
search
warrant
issued
to
revenue
officers
was
an
ancient
device
hateful
to
a
people
who
cherished
the
spirit
of
personal
independence
and
who
had
made
actual
gains
in
the
practice
of
civil
liberty
to
allow
a
minion
of
the
law
to
enter
a
man
house
and
search
his
papers
and
premises
was
too
much
for
the
emotions
of
people
who
had
fled
to
america
in
a
quest
for
and
free
homes
who
had
braved
such
hardships
to
establish
them
and
who
wanted
to
trade
without
official
interference
the
writ
of
assistance
had
been
used
in
massachusetts
in
to
prevent
illicit
trade
with
canada
and
had
aroused
a
violent
hostility
at
that
time
in
it
was
again
the
subject
of
a
bitter
controversy
which
arose
in
connection
with
the
application
of
a
customs
officer
to
a
massachusetts
court
for
writs
of
assistance
as
usual
this
application
was
vainly
opposed
by
james
otis
in
a
speech
of
five
hours
duration
a
speech
of
such
fire
and
eloquence
that
it
sent
every
man
who
heard
it
away
ready
to
take
up
arms
against
writs
of
assistance
otis
denounced
the
practice
as
an
exercise
of
arbitrary
power
which
had
cost
one
king
his
head
and
another
his
throne
a
tyrant
device
which
placed
the
liberty
of
every
man
in
jeopardy
enabling
any
petty
officer
to
work
possible
malice
on
any
innocent
citizen
on
the
merest
suspicion
and
to
spread
terror
and
desolation
through
the
land
what
a
scene
he
exclaimed
does
this
open
every
man
prompted
by
revenge
or
wantonness
to
inspect
the
inside
of
his
neighbor
house
may
get
a
writ
of
assistance
others
will
ask
it
from
one
arbitrary
exertion
will
provoke
another
until
society
is
involved
in
tumult
and
blood
he
did
more
than
attack
the
writ
itself
he
said
that
parliament
could
not
establish
it
because
it
was
against
the
british
constitution
this
was
an
assertion
resting
on
slender
foundation
but
it
was
quickly
echoed
by
the
people
then
and
there
james
otis
sounded
the
call
to
america
to
resist
the
exercise
of
arbitrary
power
by
royal
officers
then
and
there
wrote
john
adams
the
child
independence
was
born
such
was
the
hated
writ
that
townshend
proposed
to
put
into
the
hands
of
customs
officers
in
his
grim
determination
to
enforce
the
law
new
york
assembly
in
the
very
month
that
acts
were
signed
by
the
king
parliament
took
a
still
more
drastic
step
the
assembly
of
new
york
protesting
against
the
ruinous
and
insupportable
expense
involved
had
failed
to
make
provision
for
the
care
of
british
troops
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
quartering
act
parliament
therefore
suspended
the
assembly
until
it
promised
to
obey
the
law
it
was
not
until
a
third
election
was
held
that
compliance
with
the
quartering
act
was
wrung
from
the
reluctant
province
in
the
meantime

adopted
a

to

informing
them
of
the
state

roundly
condemning

declared
that

that

could
not
from
the
nature

to
submit

in
his

to

however
adams
warned
the

against

were

very
appointment
of
such
a
commission
aroused
the
patriots
of
virginia
to
action
and
in
march
the
house
of
burgesses
passed
a
resolution
creating
a
standing
committee
of
correspondence
to
develop
coöperation
among
the

in
resistance
to
british
measures

tea
although
the
british
government
finding
the
townshend
revenue
act
a
failure
repealed
in
all
the
duties
except
that
on
tea
it
in
no
way
relaxed
its
resolve
to
enforce
the
other
commercial
regulations
it
had
imposed
on
the
colonies
moreover
parliament
decided
to
relieve
the
british
east
india
company
of
the
financial
difficulties
into
which
it
had
fallen
partly
by
reason
of
the
tea
act
and
the
colonial
boycott
that
followed

to
return

the
company

levied
in
england
on
all

transshipped
to
america
a
small
impost
of
three
pence
to
be
collected
in
america
was
left
as
a
reminder
of
the
principle
laid
down
in
the
declaratory
act
that
parliament
had
the
right
to
tax
the
colonists
this
arrangement
with
the
east
india
company
was
obnoxious
to
the
colonists
for
several
reasons
it
was
an
act
of
favoritism
for
one
thing
in
the
interest
of
a
great
monopoly
for
another
thing
it
promised
to
dump
on
the
american
market
suddenly
an
immense
amount
of
cheap
tea
and
so
cause
heavy
losses
to
american
merchants
who
had
large
stocks
on
hand
it
threatened
with
ruin
the
business
of
all
those
who
were
engaged
in
clandestine
trade
with
the
dutch
it
carried
with
it
an
irritating
tax
of
three
pence
on
imports
in
charleston
annapolis
new
york
and
boston
captains
of
ships
who
brought
tea
under
this
act
were
roughly
handled
one
night
in
december
a
band
of
boston
citizens
disguised
as
indians
boarded
the
hated
tea
ships
and
dumped
the
cargo
into
the
harbor
this
was
serious
business
for
it
was
open
flagrant
determined
violation
of
the
law
as
such
the
british
government
viewed
it
retaliation
by
the
british
government
of
the
news
of
the
tea
the
news
of
the
tea
riot
in
boston
confirmed
king
george
in
his
conviction
that
there
should
be
no
soft
policy
in
dealing
with
his
american
subjects
the
die
is
cast
he
stated
with
evident
satisfaction
the
colonies
must
either
triumph
or
submit
if
we
take
the
resolute
part
they
will
undoubtedly
be
very
meek
lord
george
germain

the
tea
party
as
the
proceedings
of

tumultuous
and
riotous
rabble

ought
if
they
had
the
least
prudence
to
follow
their
mercantile
employments

not
trouble
themselves
with

five
intolerable
parliament
beginning
on

passed
five
stringent
measures
known
in
american
history
as
the
five
intolerable
acts
they
were
aimed
at
curing
the
unrest
in
america
the
of
them
was
a
bill
absolutely
shutting
the
port
of
boston
to
commerce
with
the
outside
world
the
following
closely
revoked
the
massachusetts
charter
of

provided
furthermore
that
the
councilors
should
be
appointed
by
the
king
that
all
judges
should
be
named
by
the
royal
governor
and
that
town
meetings
except
to
elect
certain
officers
could
not
be
held
without
the
governor
consent

measure
after
denouncing
the
utter
subversion
of

colonies
the
trials
of
officers
or
other
persons
accused
of
murder
in
connection
with
the
enforcement
of
the
law
the
act
legalized
the
quartering
of
troops
in
massachusetts

the
of
the
measures
was
the
quebec
act
which
granted
religious
toleration
to
the
catholics
in
canada
extended
the
boundaries
of
quebec
southward
to
the
ohio
river
and
established
in
this
western
region

by
a
viceroy
the
intolerable
acts
went
through
parliament
with
extraordinary
celerity
there
was
an
opposition
alert
and
informed
but
it
was
ineffective
burke
spoke
eloquently
against
the
boston
port
bill
condemning
it
roundly
for
punishing
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
and
showing
how
likely
it
was
to
bring
grave
consequences
in
its
train
he
was
heard
with
respect
and
his
pleas
were
rejected
the
bill
passed
both
houses
without
a
division

the
triumph
of

ministry
was
complete
what
passed
in
boston
exclaimed
the
great
jurist
lord
mansfield
is
the
overt
act
of
high
treason
proceeding
from
our
over
lenity
and
want
of
foresight
the
crown
and
parliament
were
united
in
resorting
to
punitive
measures
in
the
colonies
the
laws
were
received
with
consternation
to
the
american
protestants
the
quebec
act
was
the
most
offensive
that
project
they
viewed
not
as
an
act
of
grace
or
of
mercy
but
as
a
direct
attempt
to
enlist
french
canadians
on
the
side
of
great
britain
the
british
government
did
not
grant
religious
toleration
to
catholics
either
at
home
or
in
ireland
and
the
americans
could
see
no
good
motive
in
granting
it
in
north
america
the
act
was
also
offensive
because
massachusetts
connecticut
and
virginia
had
under
their
charters
large
claims
in
the
territory
thus
annexed
to
quebec
to
enforce
these
intolerable
acts
the
military
arm
of
the
british
government
was
brought
into

doctrine
of
natural
the
dissolution
of
assemblies
the
destruction
of
charters
and
the
use
of
troops
produced
in
the
colonies
a
new
phase
in
the
struggle
in
the
early
days
of
the
contest
with
the
british
ministry
the
americans
spoke
of
their
rights
as
englishmen
and
condemned
the
acts
of
parliament
as
unlawful
as
violating
the
principles
of
the
english
constitution
under
which
they
all
lived
when
they
saw
that
such
arguments
had
no
effect
on
parliament
they
turned
for
support
to
their
natural
rights
the
latter
doctrine
in
the
form
in
which
it
was
employed
by
the
colonists
was
as
english
as
the
constitutional
argument
john
locke
had
used
it
with
good
effect
in
defense
of
the
english
revolution
in
the
seventeenth
century
american
leaders
familiar
with
the
writings
of
locke
also
took
up
his
thesis
in
the
hour
of
their
distress
they
openly
declared
that
their
rights
did
not
rest
after
all
upon
the
english
constitution
or
a
charter
from
the
crown
old
magna
carta
was
not
the
beginning
of
all
things
retorted
otis
when
the
constitutional
argument
failed
a
time
may
come
when
parliament
shall
declare
every
american
charter
void
but
the
natural
inherent
and
inseparable
rights
of
the
colonists
as
men
and
as
citizens
would
remain
and
whatever
became
of
charters
can
never
be
abolished
until
the
general
conflagration
of
the
same
opinion
was
the
young
and
impetuous
alexander
hamilton
the
sacred
rights
of
mankind
he
exclaimed
are
not
to
be
rummaged
for
among
old
parchments
or
musty
records
they
are
written
as
with
a
sunbeam
in
the
whole
volume
of
human
destiny
by
the
hand
of
divinity
itself
and
can
never
be
erased
or
obscured
by
mortal
power
firm
as
the
american
leaders
were
in
the
statement
and
defense
of
their
rights
there
is
every
reason
for
believing
that
in
the
beginning
they
hoped
to
confine
the
conflict
to
the
realm
of
opinion
they
constantly
avowed
that
they
were
loyal
to
the
king
when
protesting
in
the
strongest
language
against
his
policies
even
otis
regarded
by
the
loyalists
as
a
firebrand
was
in
fact
attempting
to
avert
revolution
by
winning
concessions
from
england
i
argue
this
cause
with
the
greater
pleasure
he
solemnly
urged
in
his
speech
against
the
writs
of
assistance
as
it
is
in
favor
of
british
liberty
and
as
it
is
in
opposition
to
a
kind
of
power
the
exercise
of
which
in
former
periods
cost
one
king
of
england
his
head
and
another
his
throne
offers
the
doctrine
of
the
flooding
tide
of
american
sentiment
was
correctly
measured
by
one
englishman
at
least
edmund
burke
who
quickly
saw
that
attempts
to
restrain
the
rise
of
american
democracy
were
efforts
to
reverse
the
processes
of
nature
he
saw
how
fixed
and
rooted
in
the
nature
of
things
was
the
american
spirit
how
inevitable
how
irresistible
he
warned
his
countrymen
that
there
were
three
ways
of
handling
the
delicate
situation
and
only
three
one
was
to
remove
the
cause
of
friction
by
changing
the
spirit
of
the
colonists
an
utter
impossibility
because
that
spirit
was
grounded
in
the
essential
circumstances
of
american
life
the
second
was
to
prosecute
american
leaders
as
criminals
of
this
he
begged
his
countrymen
to
beware
lest
the
colonists
declare
that
a
government
against
which
a
claim
of
liberty
is
tantamount
to
high
treason
is
a
government
to
which
submission
is
equivalent
to
slavery
the
third
and
right
way
to
meet
the
problem
burke
concluded
was
to
accept
the
american
spirit
repeal
the
obnoxious
measures
and
receive
the
colonies
into
equal
partnership
produce
the
great
the
right
way
indicated
by
burke
was
equally
impossible
to
george
iii
and
the
majority
in
parliament
to
their
narrow
minds
american
opinion
was
contemptible
and
american
resistance
unlawful
riotous
and
treasonable
the
correct
way
in
their
view
was
to
dispatch
more
troops
to
crush
the
rebels
and
that
very
act
took
the
contest
from
the
realm
of
opinion
as
john
adams
said
facts
are
stubborn
things
opinions
were

a

appropriately
called
by

on
june
at
the
instigation
of

the
response
to
the
summons
was
electric
by
hurried
and
irregular
methods
delegates
were

devices
the

moderation
the
congress
drew
up
a
declaration
of
american
rights
and
stated
in
clear
and
dignified
language
the
grievances
of
the
colonists
it
approved
the
resistance

offered
by

congress
was
not
content
however
with
professions
of
faith

with
petitions
it
took
one
revolutionary
step
it
agreed
to
stop
the
importation
of
british
goods
into

the

this
agreement
it
placed
in

the
significance

itself
athwart
british
law
it
made
a
rule
to
bind
american
citizens
and
to
be
carried
into

by
american
officers
it
set
up
a
state
within
the
british
state
and
laid
down
a
test
of
allegiance
to
the
new
order
the
colonists
who
up
to
this
moment
had
been
wavering
had
to
choose
one
authority
or
the
other
they
were
for
the
enforcement
of

they
were

it

any

assume
its

of

defense
and

this
olive

accompanied
by
a
resolution
assuring
the
king
of
support
at
all
hazards
in
suppressing
the
rebellion

by
the

made
a
temperate

answer

conciliation

proposal
was
unsatisfactory

to

laid
the

ashes
instead

praising
the
british

it
aside

protesting
that
it
was
owing
to
the
constitution

not
to
the
constitution
of

thus
summarily

paine
proceeded
relentlessly
to
an
argument
for
immediate
separation
from
great
britain

was
nothing

weighty

be
managed
with

by

so
distant
from

and

of
america
as
more
than
copies
were
scattered
broadcast
over
the
country
patriots
exclaimed
with
washington
sound
doctrine
and
unanswerable
reason
drift
of
events
toward
official
support
for
the
idea
of
independence
began
to
come
from
many
quarters
on
the
tenth
of
february
gadsden
in
the
provincial
convention
of
south
carolina
advocated
a
new
constitution
for
the
colony
and
absolute
independence
for
all
america
the
convention
balked
at
the
latter
but
went
half
way
by
abolishing
the
system
of
royal
administration
and
establishing
a
complete
plan
of
a
month
later
on
april
the
neighboring
state
of
north
carolina
uttered
the
daring
phrase
from
which
others
shrank
it
empowered
its
representatives
in
the
congress
to
concur
with
the
delegates
of
the
other
colonies
in
declaring
independence
rhode
island
massachusetts
and
virginia
quickly
responded
to
the
challenge
the
convention
of
the
old
dominion
on
may
instructed
its
delegates
at
philadelphia
to
propose
the
independence
of
the
united
colonies
and
to
give
the
assent
of
virginia
to
the
act
of
separation
when
the
resolution
was
carried
the
british
flag
on
the
state
house
was
lowered
for
all
time
meanwhile
the
continental
congress
was
alive
to
the
course
of
events
outside
the
subject
of
independence
was
constantly
being
raised
are
we
rebels
exclaimed
wyeth
of
virginia
during
a
debate
in
february
no
we
must
declare
ourselves
a
free
people
others
hesitated
and
spoke
of
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
commissioners
of
conciliation
is
not
america
already
independent
asked
samuel
adams
a
few
weeks
later
why
not
then
declare
it
still
there
was
uncertainty
and
delegates
avoided
the
direct
word
a
few
more
weeks
elapsed
at
last
on
may
congress
declared
that
the
authority
of
the
british
crown
in
america
must
be
suppressed
and
advised
the
colonies
to
set
up
governments
of
their
own
illustration
an
old
thomas
jefferson
reading
his
draft
of
the
declaration
of
independence
to
the
committee
of
congress
the
way
was
fully
prepared
therefore
when
on
june
the
virginia
delegation
in
the
congress
moved
that
these
united
colonies
are
and
of
right
ought
to
be
free
and
independent
states
a
committee
was
immediately
appointed
to
draft
a
formal
document
setting
forth
the
reasons
for
the
act
and
on
july
all
the
states
save
new
york
went
on
record
in
favor
of
severing
their
political
connection
with
great
britain
two
days
later
july
jefferson
draft
of
the
declaration
of
independence
changed
in
some
slight
particulars
was
adopted
the
old
bell
in
independence
hall
as
it
is
now
known
rang
out
the
glad
tidings
couriers
swiftly
carried
the
news
to
the
uttermost
hamlet
and
farm
a
new
nation
announced
its
will
to
have
a
place
among
the
powers
of
the
world
to
some
documents
is
given
immortality
the
declaration
of
independence
is
one
of
them
american
patriotism
is
forever
associated
with
it
but
patriotism
alone
does
not
make
it
immortal
neither
does
the
vigor
of
its
language
or
the
severity
of
its
indictment
give
it
a
secure
place
in
the
records
of
time
the
secret
of
its
greatness
lies
in
the
simple
fact
that
it
is
one
of
the
memorable
landmarks
in
the
history
of
a
political
ideal
which
for
three
centuries
has
been
taking
form
and
spreading
throughout
the
earth
challenging
kings
and
potentates
shaking
down
thrones
and
aristocracies
breaking
the
armies
of
irresponsible
power
on
battle
fields
as
far
apart
as
marston
moor
and
that
ideal
now
so
familiar
then
so
novel
is
summed
up
in
the
simple
sentence
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
written
in
a
decent
respect
for
the
opinions
of
mankind
to
set
forth
the
causes
which
impelled
the
american
colonists
to
separate
from
britain
the
declaration
contained
a
long
list
of
abuses
and
usurpations
which
had
induced
them
to
throw
off
the
government
of
king
george
that
section
of
the
declaration
has
passed
into
ancient
history
and
is
seldom
read
it
is
the
part
laying
down
a
new
basis
for
government
and
giving
a
new
dignity
to
the
common
man
that
has
become
a
household
phrase
in
the
old
world
as
in
the
new
in
the
more
enduring
passages
there
are
four
fundamental
ideas
which
from
the
standpoint
of
the
old
system
of
government
were
the
essence
of
revolution
all
men
are
created
equal
and
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
including
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
the
purpose
of
government
is
to
secure
these
rights
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
whenever
any
form
of
government
becomes
destructive
of
these
ends
it
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
alter
or
abolish
it
and
institute
new
government
laying
its
foundations
on
such
principles
and
organizing
its
powers
in
such
form
as
to
them
shall
seem
most
likely
to
effect
their
safety
and
happiness
here
was
the
prelude
to
the
historic
drama
of
democracy
a
challenge
to
every
form
of
government
and
every
privilege
not
founded
on
popular
assent
the
establishment
of
government
and
the
new
allegiance
committees
of
as
soon
as
debate
had
passed
into
armed
resistance
the
patriots
found
it
necessary
to
consolidate
their
forces
by
organizing
civil
government
this
was
readily
effected
for
the
means
were
at
hand
in
town
meetings
provincial
legislatures
and
committees
of
correspondence
the
working
tools
of
the
revolution
were
in
fact
the
committees
of
correspondence
small
local
unofficial
groups
of
patriots
formed
to
exchange
views
and
create
public
sentiment
as
early
as
november
such
a
committee
had
been
created
in
boston
under
the
leadership
of
samuel
adams
it
held
regular
meetings
sent
emissaries
to
neighboring
towns
and
carried
on
a
campaign
of
education
in
the
doctrines
of
liberty
illustration
the
colonies
of
north
america
at
the
time
of
the
declaration
of
independence
upon
local
organizations
similar
in
character
to
the
boston
committee
were
built
county
committees
and
then
the
larger
colonial
committees
congresses
and
conventions
all
unofficial
and
representing
the
revolutionary
elements
ordinarily
the
provincial
convention
was
merely
the
old
legislative
assembly
freed
from
all
royalist
sympathizers
and
controlled
by
patriots
finally
upon
these
colonial
assemblies
was
built
the
continental
congress
the
precursor
of
union
under
the
articles
of
confederation
and
ultimately
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
this
was
the
revolutionary
government
set
up
within
the
british
empire
in
america
constitutions
with
the
rise
of
these
new
assemblies
of
the
people
the
old
colonial
governments
broke
down
from
the
royal
provinces
the
governor
the
judges
and
the
high
officers
fled
in
haste
and
it
became
necessary
to
substitute
patriot
authorities
the
appeal
to
the
colonies
advising
them
to
adopt
a
new
form
of
government
for
themselves
issued
by
the
congress
in
may
was
quickly
acted
upon
before
the
expiration
of
a
year
virginia
new
jersey
pennsylvania
delaware
maryland
georgia
and
new
york
had
drafted
new
constitutions
as
states
not
as
colonies
uncertain
of
their
destinies
connecticut
and
rhode
island
holding
that
their
ancient
charters
were
equal
to
their
needs
merely
renounced
their
allegiance
to
the
king
and
went
on
as
before
so
far
as
the
form
of
government
was
concerned
south
carolina
which
had
drafted
a
temporary
plan
early
in
drew
up
a
new
and
more
complete
constitution
in
two
years
later
massachusetts
with
much
deliberation
put
into
force
its
fundamental
law
which
in
most
of
its
essential
features
remains
unchanged
the
new
state
constitutions
in
their
broad
outlines
followed
colonial
models
for
the
royal
governor
was
substituted
a
governor
or
president
chosen
usually
by
the
legislature
but
in
two
instances
new
york
and
massachusetts
by
popular
vote
for
the
provincial
council
there
was
substituted
except
in
georgia
a
senate
while
the
lower
house
or
assembly
was
continued
virtually
without
change
the
old
property
restriction
on
the
suffrage
though
lowered
slightly
in
some
states
was
continued
in
full
force
to
the
great
discontent
of
the
mechanics
thus
deprived
of
the
ballot
the
special
qualifications
laid
down
in
several
constitutions
for
governors
senators
and
representatives
indicated
that
the
revolutionary
leaders
were
not
prepared
for
any
radical
experiments
in
democracy
the
protests
of
a
few
women
like
john
adams
of
massachusetts
and
henry
corbin
of
virginia
against
a
government
which
excluded
them
from
political
rights
were
treated
as
mild
curiosities
of
no
significance
although
in
new
jersey
women
were
allowed
to
vote
for
many
years
on
the
same
terms
as
men
by
the
new
state
constitutions
the
signs
and
symbols
of
royal
power
of
authority
derived
from
any
source
save
the
people
were
swept
aside
and
republican
governments
on
an
imposing
scale
presented
for
the
first
time
to
the
modern
world
copies
of
these
remarkable
documents
prepared
by
plain
citizens
were
translated
into
french
and
widely
circulated
in
europe
there
they
were
destined
to
serve
as
a
guide
and
inspiration
to
a
generation
of
whose
mission
it
was
to
begin
the
democratic
revolution
in
the
old
world
articles
of
the
formation
of
state
constitutions
was
an
easy
task
for
the
revolutionary
leaders
they
had
only
to
build
on
foundations
already
laid
the
establishment
of
a
national
system
of
government
was
another
matter
there
had
always
been
it
must
be
remembered
a
system
of
central
control
over
the
colonies
but
americans
had
had
little
experience
in
its
operation
when
the
supervision
of
the
crown
of
great
britain
was
suddenly
broken
the
patriot
leaders
accustomed
merely
to
provincial
statesmanship
were
poorly
trained
for
action
on
a
national
stage
many
forces
worked
against
those
who
like
franklin
had
a
vision
of
national
destiny
there
were
differences
in
economic
interest
commerce
and
industry
in
the
north
and
the
planting
system
of
the
south
there
were
contests
over
the
apportionment
of
taxes
and
the
quotas
of
troops
for
common
defense
to
these
practical
difficulties
were
added
local
pride
the
vested
rights
of
state
and
village
politicians
in
their
provincial
dignity
and
the
scarcity
of
men
with
a
large
outlook
upon
the
common
enterprise
nevertheless
necessity
compelled
them
to
consider
some
sort
of
federation
the
second
continental
congress
had
hardly
opened
its
work
before
the
most
sagacious
leaders
began
to
urge
the
desirability
of
a
permanent
connection
as
early
as
july
congress
resolved
to
go
into
a
committee
of
the
whole
on
the
state
of
the
union
and
franklin
undaunted
by
the
fate
of
his
albany
plan
of
twenty
years
before
again
presented
a
draft
of
a
constitution
long
and
desultory
debates
followed
and
it
was
not
until
late
in
that
congress
presented
to
the
states
the
articles
of
confederation
provincial
jealousies
delayed
ratification
and
it
was
the
spring
of
a
few
months
before
the
surrender
of
cornwallis
at
yorktown
when
maryland
the
last
of
the
states
approved
the
articles
this
plan
of
union
though
it
was
all
that
could
be
wrung
from
the
reluctant
states
provided
for
neither
a
chief
executive
nor
a
system
of
federal
courts
it
created
simply
a
congress
of
delegates
in
which
each
state
had
an
equal
voice
and
gave
it
the
right
to
call
upon
the
state
legislatures
for
the
sinews
of
government
money
and
soldiers
application
of
tests
of
as
the
successive
steps
were
taken
in
the
direction
of
independent
government
the
patriots
devised
and
applied
tests
designed
to
discover
who
were
for
and
who
were
against
the
new
nation
in
the
process
of
making
when
the
first
continental
congress
agreed
not
to
allow
the
importation
of
british
goods
it
provided
for
the
creation
of
local
committees
to
enforce
the
rules
such
agencies
were
duly
formed
by
the
choice
of
men
favoring
the
scheme
all
opponents
being
excluded
from
the
elections
before
these
bodies
those
who
persisted
in
buying
british
goods
were
summoned
and
warned
or
punished
according
to
circumstances
as
soon
as
the
new
state
constitutions
were
put
into
effect
local
committees
set
to
work
in
the
same
way
to
ferret
out
all
who
were
not
outspoken
in
their
support
of
the
new
order
of
things
illustration
mobbing
the
tories
these
patriot
agencies
bearing
different
names
in
different
sections
were
sometimes
ruthless
in
their
methods
they
called
upon
all
men
to
sign
the
test
of
loyalty
frequently
known
as
the
association
test
those
who
refused
were
promptly
branded
as
outlaws
while
some
of
the
more
dangerous
were
thrown
into
jail
the
prison
camp
in
connecticut
at
one
time
held
the
former
governor
of
new
jersey
and
the
mayor
of
new
york
thousands
were
and
subjected
to
espionage
the
of
pennsylvania
contained
the
names
of
nearly
five
hundred
persons
of
prominence
who
were
under
suspicion
loyalists
or
tories
who
were
bold
enough
to
speak
and
write
against
the
revolution
were
suppressed
and
their
pamphlets
burned
in
many
places
particularly
in
the
north
the
property
of
the
loyalists
was
confiscated
and
the
proceeds
applied
to
the
cause
of
the
revolution
the
work
of
the
official
agencies
for
suppression
of
opposition
was
sometimes
supplemented
by
mob
violence
a
few
tories
were
hanged
without
trial
and
others
were
tarred
and
feathered
one
was
placed
upon
a
cake
of
ice
and
held
there
until
his
loyalty
to
king
george
might
cool
whole
families
were
driven
out
of
their
homes
to
find
their
way
as
best
they
could
within
the
british
lines
or
into
canada
where
the
british
government
gave
them
lands
such
excesses
were
deplored
by
washington
but
they
were
defended
on
the
ground
that
in
effect
a
civil
war
as
well
as
a
war
for
independence
was
being
waged
patriots
and
thus
by
one
process
or
another
those
who
were
to
be
citizens
of
the
new
republic
were
separated
from
those
who
preferred
to
be
subjects
of
king
george
just
what
proportion
of
the
americans
favored
independence
and
what
share
remained
loyal
to
the
british
monarchy
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
the
question
of
revolution
was
not
submitted
to
popular
vote
and
on
the
point
of
numbers
we
have
conflicting
evidence
on
the
patriot
side
there
is
the
testimony
of
a
careful
and
informed
observer
john
adams
who
asserted
that
of
the
people
were
for
the
american
cause
and
not
more
than
opposed
the
revolution
at
all
stages
on
behalf
of
the
loyalists
or
tories
as
they
were
popularly
known
extravagant
claims
were
made
joseph
galloway
who
had
been
a
member
of
the
first
continental
congress
and
had
fled
to
england
when
he
saw
its
temper
testified
before
a
committee
of
parliament
in
that
not
of
the
american
people
supported
the
insurrection
and
that
many
more
than
of
the
people
prefer
a
union
with
great
britain
upon
constitutional
principles
to
independence
at
the
same
time
general
robertson
who
had
lived
in
america
years
declared
that
more
than
of
the
people
would
prefer
the
king
government
to
the
congress
tyranny
in
an
address
to
the
king
in
that
year
a
committee
of
american
loyalists
asserted
that
the
number
of
americans
in
his
majesty
army
exceeded
the
number
of
troops
enlisted
by

never

he
had
been
with
the
forces
of
washington
when
they
retreated
from
fort
lee
and
were
harried
from
new

into
pennsylvania
he
knew
the
effect
of
such
reverses
on
the
army
as
well
as
on
the
public
in
december
he
made
a
second
great
appeal
to
his
countrymen
in
his
pamphlet
the
crisis
the
first
part
of
which
he
had
written
while
defeat
and
gloom
were
all
about
him
this
tract
was
a
cry
for
continued
support
of
the
revolution
these
are
the
times
that
try
men
souls
he
opened

and
the
sunshine
patriot

in
this
crisis
shrink
from
the
service
of

but
he
that

of
men

paine
laid
his
lash
fiercely
on
the
tories
branding
every
one
as
a
coward
grounded
in
servile
slavish
fear
he
deplored
the
inadequacy
of
the
militia
and
called
for
a
real
army
he
refuted
the
charge
that
the
retreat
through
new
jersey
was
a
disaster
and
he
promised
victory
soon
by
perseverance
and
fortitude
he
concluded
we
have
the
prospect
of
a
glorious
issue
by
cowardice
and
submission
the
sad
choice
of
a
variety
of
evils
a
ravaged
country
a
depopulated
city
habitations
without
safety
and
slavery
without
hope
look
on
this
picture
and
weep
over
it
his
ringing
call
to
arms
was
followed
by
another
and
another
until
the
long
contest
was
over
military
affairs
two
phases
of
the
the
war
which
opened
with
the
battle
of
lexington
on
april
and
closed
with
the
surrender
of
cornwallis
at
yorktown
on
october
passed
through
two
distinct
phases
the
first
lasting
until
the
treaty
of
alliance
with
france
in
and
the
second
until
the
end
of
the
struggle
during
the
first
phase
the
war
was
confined
mainly
to
the
north
the
outstanding
features
of
the
contest
were
the
evacuation
of
boston
by
the
british
the
expulsion
of
american
forces
from
new
york
and
their
retreat
through
new
jersey
the
battle
of
trenton
the
seizure
of
philadelphia
by
the
british
september
the
invasion
of
new
york
by
burgoyne
and
his
capture
at
saratoga
in
october
and
the
encampment
of
american
forces
at
valley
forge
for
the
terrible
winter
of
the
final
phase
of
the
war
opening
with
the
treaty
of

with

on
february
was
confined
mainly
to
the
middle
states
the
west
and
the
south
in
the
first
sphere
of
action
the
chief
events
were
the
withdrawal
of
the
british
from
philadelphia
the
battle
of
monmouth
and
the
inclosure
of
the
british
in
new
york
by
deploying
american
forces
from
morristown
new

up
to
west
point
in

george

the

period

conquered

in
they
seized

administered

crushing
defeat
to
the
american
forces
under

at

and
overran
south
carolina
though
meeting
reverses
at
cowpens
and
king
mountain
then
came
the
closing
scenes
cornwallis
began
the
last
of
his
operations
he
pursued
general
greene
far
into
north
carolina
clashed
with
him
at
guilford
court
house
retired
to
the
coast
took
charge
of
british
forces
engaged
in
plundering
virginia
and
fortified
yorktown
where
he
was
penned
up
by
the
french
fleet
from
the
sea
and
the
combined
french
and
american
forces
on
land
geographical
aspects
of
the
for
the
british
the
theater
of
the
war
offered
many
problems
from
first
to
last
it
extended
from
massachusetts
to
georgia
a
distance
of
almost
a
thousand
miles
it
was
nearly
three
thousand
miles
from
the
main
base
of
supplies
and
though
the
british
navy
kept
the
channel
open
transports
were
constantly
falling
prey
to
daring
privateers
and
fleet
american
war
vessels
the
sea
on
the
other
hand
offered
an
easy
means
of
transportation
between
points
along
the
coast
and
gave
ready
access
to
the
american
centers
of
wealth
and
population
of
this
the
british
made
good
use
though
early
forced
to
give
up
boston
they
seized
new
york
and
kept
it
until
the
end
of
the
war
they
took
philadelphia
and
retained
it
until
threatened
by
the
approach
of
the
french
fleet
and
they
captured
and
held
both
savannah
and
charleston
wars
however
are
seldom
won
by
the
conquest
of
cities
particularly
was
this
true
in
the
case
of
the
revolution
only
a
small
portion
of
the
american
people
lived
in
towns
countrymen
back
from
the
coast
were
in
no
way
dependent
upon
them
for
a
livelihood
they
lived
on
the
produce
of
the
soil
not
upon
the
profits
of
trade
this
very
fact
gave
strength
to
them
in
the
contest
whenever
the
british
ventured
far
from
the
ports
of
entry
they
encountered
reverses
burgoyne
was
forced
to
surrender
at
saratoga
because
he
was
surrounded
and
cut
off
from
his
base
of
supplies
as
soon
as
the
british
got
away
from
charleston
they
were
harassed
and
worried
by
the
guerrilla
warriors
of
marion
sumter
and
pickens
cornwallis
could
technically
defeat
greene
at
guilford
far
in
the
interior
but
he
could
not
hold
the
inland
region
he
had
invaded
sustained
by
their
own
labor
possessing
the
interior
to
which
their
armies
could
readily
retreat
supplied
mainly
from
native
resources
the
americans
could
not
be
hemmed
in
penned
up
and
destroyed
at
one
fell
blow
sea
the
british
made
good
use
of
their
fleet
in
cutting
off
american
trade
but
control
of
the
sea
did
not
seriously
affect
the
united
states
as
an
agricultural
country
the
ruin
of
its
commerce
was
not
such
a
vital
matter
all
the
materials
for
a
comfortable
though
somewhat
rude
life
were
right
at
hand
it
made
little
difference
to
a
nation
fighting
for
existence
if
silks
fine
linens
and
chinaware
were
cut
off
this
was
an
evil
to
which
submission
was
necessary
nor
did
the
brilliant
exploits
of
john
paul
jones
and
captain
john
barry
materially
change
the
situation
they
demonstrated
the
skill
of
american
seamen
and
their
courage
as
fighting
men
they
raised
the
rates
of
british
marine
insurance
but
they
did
not
dethrone
the
mistress
of
the
seas
less
spectacular
and
more
distinctive
were
the
deeds
of
the
hundreds
of
privateers
and
minor
captains
who
overhauled
british
supply
ships
and
kept
british
merchantmen
in
constant
anxiety
not
until
the
french
fleet
was
thrown
into
the
scale
were
the
british
compelled
to
reckon
seriously
with
the
enemy
on
the
sea
and
make
plans
based
upon
the
possibilities
of
a
maritime
disaster
on
the
score
of
military
leadership
it
is
difficult
to
compare
the
contending
forces
in
the
revolutionary
contest
there
is
no
doubt
that
all
the
british
commanders
were
men
of
experience
in
the
art
of
warfare
sir
william
howe
had
served
in
america
during
the
french
war
and
was
accounted
an
excellent
officer
a
strict
disciplinarian
and
a
gallant
gentleman
nevertheless
he
loved
ease
society
and
good
living
and
his
expulsion
from
boston
his
failure
to
overwhelm
washington
by
sallies
from
his
comfortable
bases
at
new
york
and
philadelphia
destroyed
every
shred
of
his
military
reputation
john
burgoyne
to
whom
was
given
the
task
of
penetrating
new
york
from
canada
had
likewise
seen
service
in
the
french
war
both
in
america
and
europe
he
had
however
a
touch
of
the
theatrical
in
his
nature
and
after
the
collapse
of
his
plans
and
the
surrender
of
his
army
in
he
devoted
his
time
mainly
to
light
literature
sir
henry
clinton
who
directed
the
movement
which
ended
in
the
capture
of
charleston
in
had
learned
his
trade
on
the
continent
and
was
regarded
as
a
man
of
discretion
and
understanding
in
military
matters
lord
cornwallis
whose
achievements
at
camden
and
guilford
were
blotted
out
by
his
surrender
at
yorktown
had
seen
service
in
the
seven
years
war
and
had
undoubted
talents
which
he
afterward
displayed
with
great
credit
to
himself
in
india
though
none
of
them
perhaps
were
men
of
ability
they
all
had
training
and
experience
to
guide
them

george

the

had
a

in

himself
he
had
long
been
interested
in
military
strategy
and
had
tested
his
coolness
under
fire
during
the
first
clashes
with
the
french
nearly
twenty
years
before
he
had
no
doubts
about
the
justice
of
his
cause
such
as
plagued
some
of
the
british
generals

as
a
youth
had
been
wounded
at
braddock
memorable
defeat
and
had
served
with
credit
during
the
seven
years

but
he
was
the
most
conspicuous
failure
of

the
triumph
over

was
the
work
of

few
problems
of
management
to
the
british
officers
these
common
soldiers
were
far
away
from
home
and
enlisted
for
the
war
nearly
all
of
them
were
well
disciplined
and
many
of
them
experienced
in
actual
campaigns
the
armies
of
king
george
fought
bravely
as
the
records
of
bunker
hill
brandywine
and
monmouth
demonstrate
many
a
man
and
subordinate
officer
and
for
that
matter
some
of
the
high
officers
expressed
a
reluctance
at
fighting
against
their
own
kin
but
they
obeyed
orders
the
americans
on
the
other
hand
while
they
fought
with
grim
determination
as
men
fighting
for
their
homes
were
lacking
in
discipline
and
in
the
experience
of
regular
troops
when
the
war
broke
in
upon
them
there
were
no
common
preparations
for
it
there
was
no
continental
army
there
were
only
local
bands
of
militiamen
many
of
them
experienced
in
fighting
but
few
of
them
regulars
in
the
military
sense
moreover
they
were
volunteers
serving
for
a
short
time
unaccustomed
to
severe
discipline
and
impatient
at
the
restraints
imposed
on
them
by
long
and
arduous
campaigns
they
were
continually
leaving
the
service
just
at
the
most
critical
moments
the
militia
lamented
washington
come
in
you
can
not
tell
how
go
you
can
not
tell
where
consume
your
provisions
exhaust
your
stores
and
leave
you
at
last
at
a
critical
moment
again
and
again
washington
begged
congress
to
provide
for
an
army
of
regulars
enlisted
for
the
war
thoroughly
trained
and
paid
according
to
some
definite
plan
at
last
he
was
able
to
overcome
in
part
at
least
the
chronic
fear
of
civilians
in
congress
and
to
wring
from
that
reluctant
body
an
agreement
to
grant
half
pay
to
all
officers
and
a
bonus
to
all
privates
who
served
until
the
end
of
the
war
even
this
scheme
which
washington
regarded
as
far
short
of
justice
to
the
soldiers
did
not
produce
quick
results
it
was
near
the
close
of
the
conflict
before
he
had
an
army
of
veterans
capable
of
meeting
british
regulars
on
equal
terms
though
there
were
times
when
militiamen
and
frontiersmen
did
valiant
and
effective
work
it
is
due
to
historical
accuracy
to
deny
the
tradition
that
a
few
minutemen
overwhelmed
more
numerous
forces
of
regulars
in
a
seven
years
war
for
independence
they
did
nothing
of
the
sort
for
the
victories
of
bennington
trenton
saratoga
and
yorktown
there
were
the
defeats
of
bunker
hill
long
island
white
plains
germantown
and
camden
not
once
did
an
army
of
militiamen
overcome
an
equal
number
of
british
regulars
in
an
open
trial
by
battle
to
bring
men
to
be
well
acquainted
with
the
duties
of
a
soldier
wrote
washington
requires
time
to
expect
the
same
service
from
raw
and
undisciplined
recruits
as
from
veteran
soldiers
is
to
expect
what
never
did
and
perhaps
never
will
happen
the
war
was
then
how
did
the
american
army
win
the
war
for
one
thing
there
were
delays
and
blunders
on
the
part
of
the
british
generals
who
in
and
dallied
in
boston
and
new
york
with
large
bodies
of
regular
troops
when
they
might
have
been
dealing
paralyzing
blows
at
the
scattered
bands
that
constituted
the
american
army
nothing
but
the
supineness
or
folly
of
the
enemy
could
have
saved
us
solemnly
averred
washington
in
still
it
is
fair
to
say
that
this
apparent
supineness
was
not
all
due
to
the
british
generals
the
ministers
behind
them
believed
that
a
large
part
of
the
colonists
were
loyal
and
that
compromise
would
be
promoted
by
inaction
rather
than
by
a
war
vigorously
prosecuted
victory
by
masterly
inactivity
was
obviously
better
than
conquest
and
the
slighter
the
wounds
the
quicker
the
healing
later
in
the
conflict
when
the
seasoned
forces
of
france
were
thrown
into
the
scale
the
americans
themselves
had
learned
many
things
about
the
practical
conduct
of
campaigns
all
along
the
british
were
embarrassed
by
the
problem
of
supplies
their
troops
could
not
forage
with
the
skill
of
militiamen
as
they
were
in
unfamiliar
territory
the
long
oversea
voyages
were
uncertain
at
best
and
doubly
so
when
the
warships
of
france
joined
the
american
privateers
in
preying
on
supply
boats
the
british
were
in
fact
battered
and
worn
down
by
a
guerrilla
war
and
outdone
on
two
important
occasions
by
superior
forces
at
saratoga
and
yorktown
stern
facts
convinced
them
finally
that
an
immense
army
which
could
be
raised
only
by
a
supreme
effort
would
be
necessary
to
subdue
the
colonies
if
that
hazardous
enterprise
could
be
accomplished
at
all
they
learned
also
that
america
would
then
be
alienated
fretful
and
the
scene
of
endless
uprisings
calling
for
an
army
of
occupation
that
was
a
price
which
staggered
even
lord
north
and
george
iii
moreover
there
were
forces
of
opposition
at
home
with
which
they
had
to
reckon
and
the
at
no
time
were
the
women
of
america
indifferent
to
the
struggle
for
independence
when
it
was
confined
to
the
realm
of
opinion
they
did
their
part
in
creating
public
sentiment
elizabeth
timothee
for
example
founded
in
charleston
in
a
newspaper
to
espouse
the
cause
of
the
province
far
to
the
north
the
sister
of
james
otis
mercy
warren
early
begged
her
countrymen
to
rest
their
case
upon
their
natural
rights
and
in
influential
circles
she
urged
the
leaders
to
stand
fast
by
their
principles
while
john
adams
was
tossing
about
with
uncertainty
at
the
continental
congress
his
wife
was
writing
letters
to
him
declaring
her
faith
in
independency
when
the
war
came
down
upon
the
country
women
helped
in
every
field
in
sustaining
public
sentiment
they
were
active
warren
with
a
tireless
pen
combatted
loyalist
propaganda
in
many
a
drama
and
satire
almost
every
revolutionary
leader
had
a
wife
or
daughter
who
rendered
service
in
the
second
line
of
defense
washington
managed
the
plantation
while
the
general
was
at
the
front
and
went
north
to
face
the
rigors
of
the
awful
winter
at
valley
forge
an
inspiration
to
her
husband
and
his
men
the
daughter
of
benjamin
franklin
sarah
bache
while
her
father
was
pleading
the
american
cause
in
france
set
the
women
of
pennsylvania
to
work
sewing
and
collecting
supplies
even
near
the
firing
line
women
were
to
be
found
aiding
the
wounded
hauling
powder
to
the
front
and
carrying
dispatches
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
in
the
economic
sphere
the
work
of
women
was
invaluable
they
harvested
crops
without
enjoying
the
picturesque
title
of
farmerettes
and
they
canned
and
preserved
for
the
wounded
and
the
prisoners
of
war
of
their
labor
in
spinning
and
weaving
it
is
recorded
immediately
on
being
cut
off
from
the
use
of
english
manufactures
the
women
engaged
within
their
own
families
in
manufacturing
various
kinds
of
cloth
for
domestic
use
they
thus
kept
their
households
decently
clad
and
the
surplus
of
their
labors
they
sold
to
such
as
chose
to
buy
rather
than
make
for
themselves
in
this
way
the
female
part
of
families
by
their
industry
and
strict
economy
frequently
supported
the
whole
domestic
circle
evincing
the
strength
of
their
attachment
and
the
value
of
their
service
for
their
war
work
women
were
commended
by
high
authorities
on
more
than
one
occasion
they
were
given
medals
and
public
testimonials
even
as
in
our
own
day
washington
thanked
them
for
their
labors
and
paid
tribute
to
them
for
the
inspiration
and
material
aid
which
they
had
given
to
the
cause
of
independence
the
finances
of
the
revolution
when
the
revolution
opened
there
were
thirteen
little
treasuries
in
america
but
no
common
treasury
and
from
first
to
last
the
congress
was
in
the
position
of
a
beggar
rather
than
a
sovereign
having
no
authority
to
lay
and
collect
taxes
directly
and
knowing
the
hatred
of
the
provincials
for
taxation
it
resorted
mainly
to
loans
and
paper
money
to
finance
the
war
do
you
think
boldly
inquired
one
of
the
delegates
that
i
will
consent
to
load
my
constituents
with
taxes
when
we
can
send
to
the
printer
and
get
a
wagon
load
of
money
one
quire
of
which
will
pay
for
the
whole
money
and
acting
on
this
curious
but
appealing
political
economy
congress
issued
in
june
two
million
dollars
in
bills
of
credit
to
be
redeemed
by
the
states
on
the
basis
of
their
respective
populations
other
issues
followed
in
quick
succession
in
all
about
of
continental
paper
was
printed
to
which
the
several
states
added
nearly
of
their
own
notes
then
came
bonds
in
ever
increasing
quantities
several
millions
were
also
borrowed
from
france
and
small
sums
from
holland
and
spain
in
desperation
a
national
lottery
was
held
producing
meager
results
the
property
of
tories
was
confiscated
and
sold
bringing
in
about
begging
letters
were
sent
to
the
states
asking
them
to
raise
revenues
for
the
continental
treasury
but
the
states
burdened
with
their
own
affairs
gave
little
heed
and
as
paper
money
flowed
from
the
press
it
rapidly
declined
in
purchasing
power
until
in
a
dollar
was
worth
only
two
or
three
cents
in
gold
or
silver
attempts
were
made
by
congress
and
the
states
to
compel
people
to
accept
the
notes
at
face
value
but
these
were
like
attempts
to
make
water
flow
uphill
speculators
collected
at
once
to
fatten
on
the
calamities
of
the
republic
fortunes
were
made
and
lost
gambling
on
the
prices
of
public
securities
while
the
patriot

half
clothed
was
freezing
at

engrossing
forestalling
exclaimed
washington
afford
too
many
melancholy
proofs
of
the
decay
of
public
virtue
nothing
i
am
convinced
but
the
depreciation
of
our
currency
aided
by
stock
jobbing
and
party
dissensions
has
fed
the
hopes
of
the
enemy
patriot
to
the
efforts
of

in
financing
the

were
added
the
labors
of
private
citizens
hayn
solomon
a
merchant
of
philadelphia
supplied
members
of
congress
including
madison
jefferson
and
monroe
and
army
officers
like
lee
and
steuben
with
money
for
their
daily
needs
all
together
he
contributed
the
huge
sum
of
half
a
million
dollars
to
the
american
cause
and
died
broken
in
purse
if
not
in
spirit
a
british
prisoner
of
war
another
philadelphia
merchant
robert
morris
won
for
himself
the
name
of
the
patriot
financier
because
he
labored
night
and
day
to
find
the
money
to
meet
the
bills
which
poured
in
upon
the
bankrupt
government
when
his
own
funds
were
exhausted
he
borrowed
from
his
friends
experienced
in
the
handling
of
merchandise
he
created
agencies
at
important
points
to
distribute
supplies
to
the
troops
thus
displaying
administrative
as

financial
talents

robert

women
organized
drives
for
money
contributed
their
plate
and
their
jewels
and
collected
from
door
to
door
farmers
took
worthless
paper
in
return
for
their
produce
and
soldiers
saw
many
a

pass
without
yielding

a

thus
by

of
citizens
the
issuance

lotteries
the
floating
of
loans

in

and
the

the
congress
staggered
through
the
revolution
like
a
pauper
who
knows
not
how
his
next
meal
is
to
be
secured
but
is
continuously
relieved
at
a
crisis
by
a
kindly
fate
the
diplomacy
of
the
revolution
when
the
full
measure
of
honor
is
given
to
the
soldiers
and
sailors
and
their
commanding
officers
the
civilians
who
managed
finances
and
supplies
the
writers
who
sustained
the
american
spirit
and
the
women
who
did
well
their
part
there
yet
remains
the
duty
of
recognizing
the
achievements
of
diplomacy
the
importance
of
this
field
of
activity
was
keenly
appreciated
by
the
leaders
in
the
continental
congress
they
were
fairly
well
versed
in
european
history
they
knew
of
the
balance
of
power
and
the
sympathies
interests
and
prejudices
of
nations
and
their
rulers
all
this
information
they
turned
to
good
account
in
opening
relations
with
continental
countries
and
seeking
money
supplies
and
even
military
assistance
for
the
transaction
of
this
delicate
business
they
created
a
secret
committee
on
foreign
correspondence
as
early
as
and
prepared
to
send
agents
abroad
agents
sent
having
heard
that
france
was
inclining
a
friendly
ear
to
the
american
cause
the
congress
in

sent
a
commissioner
to
paris

deane
of
connecticut
often
styled
the
first
american
diplomat
later
in
the
year
a
form
of
treaty
to
be
presented
to
foreign
powers
was
drawn
up
and
franklin
arthur

were
selected
as
american
representatives
at
the
court
of
his
most
christian
majesty
the
king

john
jay
of
new

in
john

to
holland
the
same
year
and
other
agents
were
dispatched
to
florence
vienna
and
berlin
the
representative
selected
for
petersburg
spent
two
fruitless
years
there
ignored
by
the
court
living
in
obscurity
and
experiencing
nothing
but
humiliation
and
failure
frederick
the
great
king
of
prussia
expressed
a
desire
to
find
in
america
a
market
for
silesian
linens
and
woolens
but
fearing
england
command
of
the
sea
he
refused
to
give
direct
aid
to
the
revolutionary
cause
french
the
great
diplomatic
triumph
of
the
revolution
was
won
at
paris
and
benjamin
franklin
was
the
hero
of
the
occasion
although
many
circumstances
prepared
the
way
for
his
success
louis
xvi
foreign
minister
count
de
vergennes
before
the
arrival
of
any
american
representative
had
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
king
the
opportunity
offered
by
the
outbreak
of
the
war
between
england
and
her
colonies
he
showed
him
how
france
could
redress
her
grievances
and
reduce
the
power
and
greatness
of
england
the
empire
that
in
had
forced
upon
her
a
humiliating
peace
at
the
price
of

possessions
of
our
commerce

our
credit

equally
successful

french
adventurer

a
man
of
wealth
a
lover
of
music
and
the
author
of
two
popular
plays
figaro
and
the
barber
of
seville
these
two
men
had
already
urged
upon
the
king
secret
aid
for
america
before
deane
appeared
on
the
scene
shortly
after
his
arrival
they
made
confidential
arrangements
to
furnish
money
clothing
powder
and
other
supplies
to
the
struggling
colonies
although
official
requests
for
them
were
officially
refused
by
the
french
government
at
when
franklin
reached
paris
he
was
received
only
in
private
by
the
king

her
head
in
a
revolution
soon
to
follow
played
with
fire
by
encouraging
our
dear
republican
for
the
king
of
france
however
this
was
more
serious
business
england
resented
the
presence
of
this
traitor
in
paris
and
louis
had
to
be
cautious
about
plunging
into
another
war
that
might
also
end
disastrously
moreover
the
early
period
of

sojourn
in

was
a

franklin
one
night
early
in
december
while
he
and
some
friends
sat
gloomily
at
dinner
beaumarchais
who
was
with
him
grasped
at
once
the
meaning
of
the
situation
and
set
off
to
the
court
at
versailles
with
such
haste
that
he
upset
his
coach
and
dislocated
his
arm
the
king
and
his
ministers
were
at
last
convinced
that
the
hour
had
come
to
aid
the
revolution
treaties
of
commerce
and
alliance
were
drawn
up
and
signed
in
february
the
independence
of
the
united

was
recognized
by
france
and
an
alliance
was
formed
to
guarantee
that
independence

or
on

were
now
ranged
side

in
a

on
the

that
pitt
had
erected
and
that
george

was
pulling
down

holland
within
a
few
months
spain
remembering
the
steady
decline
of
her

to
unite
with

to
prey
upon

to
all
this
trouble
for
england
was
added
the
danger
of
a
possible
revolt
in

where
the
spirit
of
independence
was
flaming
up
british
offer
terms
to
seeing
the
colonists
about
to
be
joined
by
france
in
a
common
war
on
the
english
empire
lord
north
proposed
in
february
a
renewal
of
negotiations
by
solemn
enactment
parliament
declared
its
intention
not
to
exercise
the
right
of
imposing
taxes
within
the
colonies
at
the
same
time
it
authorized
the
opening
of
negotiations
through
commissioners
to
be
sent
to
america
a
truce
was
to
be
established
pardons
granted
objectionable
laws
suspended
and
the
old
imperial
constitution
as
it
stood
before
the
opening
of
hostilities
restored
to
full
vigor
it
was
too
late
events
had
taken
the
affairs
of
america
out
of
the
hands
of
british
commissioners
and
diplomats
of
french
the
french
alliance
brought
ships
of
war
large
sums
of
gold
and
silver
loads
of
supplies
and
a
considerable
body
of
trained
soldiers
to
the
aid
of
the
americans
timely
as
was
this
help
it
meant
no
sudden
change
in
the
fortunes
of
war
the
british
evacuated
philadelphia
in
the
summer
following
the
alliance
and
washington
troops
were
encouraged
to
come
out
of
valley
forge
they
inflicted
a
heavy
blow
on
the
british
at
monmouth
but
the
treasonable
conduct
of
general
charles
lee
prevented
a
triumph
the
recovery
of
philadelphia
was
offset
by
the
treason
of
benedict
arnold
the
loss
of
savannah
and
charleston
and
the
defeat
of
gates
at
camden
the
full
effect
of
the
french
alliance
was
not
felt
until
when
cornwallis
went
into
virginia
and
settled
at
yorktown
accompanied
by
french
troops
washington
swept
rapidly
southward
and
penned
the
british
to
the
shore
while
a
powerful
french
fleet
shut
off
their
escape
by
sea
it
was
this
movement
which
certainly
could
not
have
been
executed
without
french
aid
that
put
an
end
to
all
chance
of
restoring
british
dominion
in
america
it
was
the
surrender
of
cornwallis
at
yorktown
that
caused
lord
north
to
pace
the
floor
and
cry
out
it
is
all
over
it
is
all
over
what
might
have
been
done
without
the
french
alliance
lies
hidden
from
mankind
what
was
accomplished
with
the
help
of
french
soldiers
sailors
officers
money
and
supplies
is
known
to
all
the
earth
all
the
world
agree
exultantly
wrote
franklin
from
paris
to
general
washington
that
no
expedition
was
ever
better
planned
or
better
executed
it
brightens
the
glory
that
must
accompany
your
name
to
the
latest
posterity
diplomacy
as
well
as
martial
valor
had
its
reward
peace
at
last
opposition
to
the
in
measuring
the
forces
that
led
to
the
final
discomfiture
of
king
george
and
lord
north
it
is
necessary
to
remember
that
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
the
british
ministry
at
home
faced
a
powerful
informed
and
relentless
opposition
there
were
vigorous
protests
first
against
the
obnoxious
acts
which
precipitated
the
unhappy
quarrel
then
against
the
way
in
which
the
war
was
waged
and
finally
against
the
futile
struggle
to
retain
a
hold
upon
the
american
dominions
among
the
members
of
parliament
who
thundered
against
the
government
were
the
first
statesmen
and
orators
of
the
land
william
pitt
earl
of
chatham
though
he
deplored
the
idea
of
american
independence
denounced
the
government
as
the
aggressor
and
rejoiced
in
american
resistance
edmund
burke
leveled
his
heavy
batteries
against
every
measure
of
coercion
and
at
last
strove
for
a
peace
which
while
giving
independence
to
america
would
work
for
reconciliation
rather
than
estrangement
charles
james
fox
gave
the
colonies
his
generous
sympathy
and
warmly
championed
their
rights
outside
of
the
circle
of
statesmen
there
were
stout
friends
of
the
american
cause
like
david
hume
the
philosopher
and
historian
and
catherine
macaulay
an
author
of
wide
fame
and
a
republican
bold
enough
to
encourage
washington
in
seeing
it
through
against
this
powerful
opposition
the
government
enlisted
a
whole
army
of
scribes
and
journalists
to
pour
out
criticism
on
the
americans
and
their
friends
samuel
johnson
whom
it
employed
in
this
business
was
so
savage
that
even
the
ministers
had
to
tone
down
his
pamphlets
before
printing
them
far
more
weighty
was
edward
gibbon
who
was
in
time
to
win
fame
as
the
historian
of
the
and
fall
of
the
roman
he
had
at
first
opposed
the
government
but
on
being
given
a
lucrative
post
he
used
his
sharp
pen
in
its
support
causing
his
friends
to
ridicule
him
in
these
lines
king
george
in
a
fright
lest
gibbon
should
write
the
story
of
england
disgrace
thought
no
way
so
sure
his
pen
to
secure
as
to
give
the
historian
a
place
north
as
time
wore
on
events
bore
heavily
on
the
side
of
the
opponents
of
the
government
measures
they
had
predicted
that
conquest
was
impossible
and
they
had
urged
the
advantages
of
a
peace
which
would
in
some
measure
restore
the
affections
of
the
americans
every
day
news
confirmed
their
predictions
and
lent
support
to
their
arguments
moreover
the
war
which
sprang
out
of
an
effort
to
relieve
english
burdens
made
those
burdens
heavier
than
ever
military
expenses
were
daily
increasing
trade
with
the
colonies
the
greatest
single
outlet
for
british
goods
and
capital
was
paralyzed
the
heavy
debts
due
british
merchants
in
america
were
not
only
unpaid
but
postponed
into
an
indefinite
future
ireland
was
on
the
verge
of
revolution
the
french
had
a
dangerous
fleet
on
the
high
seas
in
vain
did
the
king
assert
in
december
that
no
difficulties
would
ever
make
him
consent
to
a
peace
that
meant
american
independence
parliament
knew
better
and
on
february
in
the
house
of
commons
was
carried
an
address
to
the
throne
against
continuing
the
war
burke
fox
the
younger
pitt
barré
and
other
friends
of
the
colonies
voted
in
the
affirmative
lord
north
gave
notice
then
that
his
ministry
was
at
an
end
the
king
moaned
necessity
made
me
yield
in
april
franklin
received
word
from
the
english
government
that
it
was
prepared
to
enter
into
negotiations
leading
to
a
settlement
this
was
embarrassing
in
the
treaty
of
alliance
with
france
the
united
states
had
promised
that
peace
should
be
a
joint
affair
agreed
to
by
both
nations
in
open
conference
finding
france
however
opposed
to
some
of
their
claims
respecting
boundaries
and
fisheries
the
american
commissioners
conferred
with
the
british
agents
at
paris
without
consulting
the
french
minister
they
actually
signed
a
preliminary
peace
draft
before
they
informed
him
of
their
operations
when
vergennes
reproached
him
franklin
replied
that
they
had
been
guilty
of
neglecting
good
manners
but
hoped
that
the
great
work
would
not
be
ruined
by
a
single
indiscretion
terms
of
peace
the
general
settlement
at
paris
in
was
a
triumph
for
america
england
recognized
the
independence
of
the
united
states
naming
each
state
specifically
and
agreed
to
boundaries
extending
from
the
atlantic
to
the
mississippi
and
from
the
great
lakes
to
the
floridas
england
held
canada
newfoundland
and
the
west
indies
intact
made
gains
in
india
and
maintained
her
supremacy
on
the
seas
spain
won
florida
and
minorca
but
not
the
coveted
gibraltar
france
gained
nothing
important
save
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
england
humbled
and
the
colonies
independent
the
generous
terms
secured
by
the
american
commission
at
paris
called
forth
surprise
and
gratitude
in
the
united
states
and
smoothed
the
way
for
a
renewal
of
commercial
relations
with
the
mother
country
at
the
same
time
they
gave
genuine
anxiety
to
european
diplomats
this
federal
republic
is
born
a
pigmy
wrote
the
spanish
ambassador
to
his
royal
master
a
day
will
come
when
it
will
be
a
giant
even
a
colossus
formidable
to
these
countries
liberty
of
conscience
and
the
facility
for
establishing
a
new
population
on
immense
lands
as
well
as
the
advantages
of
the
new
government
will
draw
thither
farmers
and
artisans
from
all
the
nations
in
a
few
years
we
shall
watch
with
grief
the
tyrannical
existence
of
the
same
colossus
illustration
north
america
according
to
the
treaty
of
summary
of
the
revolutionary
period
the
independence
of
the
american
colonies
was
foreseen
by
many
european
statesmen
as
they
watched
the
growth
of
their
population
wealth
and
power
but
no
one
could
fix
the
hour
of
the
great
event
until
the
american
colonists
lived
fairly
happily
under
british
dominion
there
were
collisions
from
time
to
time
of
course
royal
governors
clashed
with
colonial
legislatures
there
were
protests
against
the
exercise
of
the
king
veto
power
in
specific
cases
nevertheless
on
the
whole
the
relations
between
america
and
the
mother
country
were
more
amicable
in
than
at
any
period
under
the
stuart
régime
which
closed
in
the
crash
when
it
came
was
not
deliberately
willed
by
any
one
it
was
the
product
of
a
number
of
forces
that
happened
to
converge
about
three
years
before
there
had
come
to
the
throne
george
iii
a
young
proud
inexperienced
and
stubborn
king
for
nearly
fifty
years
his
predecessors
germans
as
they
were
in
language
and
interest
had
allowed
things
to
drift
in
england
and
america
george
iii
decided
that
he
would
be
king
in
fact
as
well
as
in
name
about
the
same
time
england
brought
to
a
close
the
long
and
costly
french
and
indian
war
and
was
staggering
under
a
heavy
burden
of
debt
and
taxes
the
war
had
been
fought
partly
in
defense
of
the
american
colonies
and
nothing
seemed
more
reasonable
to
english
statesmen
than
the
idea
that
the
colonies
should
bear
part
of
the
cost
of
their
own
defense
at
this
juncture
there
came
into
prominence
in
royal
councils
two
men
bent
on
taxing
america
and
controlling
her
trade
grenville
and
townshend
the
king
was
willing
the
english
taxpayers
were
thankful
for
any
promise
of
relief
and
statesmen
were
found
to
undertake
the
experiment
england
therefore
set
out
upon
a
new
course
she
imposed
taxes
upon
the
colonists
regulated
their
trade
and
set
royal
officers
upon
them
to
enforce
the
law
this
action
evoked
protests
from
the
colonists
they
held
a
stamp
act
congress
to
declare
their
rights
and
petition
for
a
redress
of
grievances
some
of
the
more
restless
spirits
rioted
in
the
streets
sacked
the
houses
of
the
king
officers
and
tore
up
the
stamped
paper
frightened
by
uprising
the
english
government
drew
back
and
repealed
the
stamp
act
then
it
veered
again
and
renewed
its
policy
of
interference
interference
again
called
forth
american
protests
protests
aroused
sharper
retaliation
more
british
regulars
were
sent
over
to
keep
order
more
irritating
laws
were
passed
by
parliament
rioting
again
appeared
tea
was
dumped
in
the
harbor
of
boston
and
seized
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
the
british
answer
was
more
force
the
response
of
the
colonists
was
a
continental
congress
for
defense
an
unexpected
and
unintended
clash
of
arms
at
lexington
and
concord
in
the
spring
of
brought
forth
from
the
king
of
england
a
proclamation
the
americans

the

the
american

begun
washington

by
finest
enthusiasm
uninstructed
by
experience
could
not
alone
make
the
republic
great
and
prosperous
or
even
free
all
around
them
they
saw
chaos
in
finance
and
in
industry
and
perils
for
the
immediate
future
weakness
of
the
articles
of
the
government
under
the
articles
of
confederation
had
neither
the
strength
nor
the
resources
necessary
to
cope
with
the
problems
of
reconstruction
left
by
the
war
the
sole
organ
of
government
was
a
congress
composed
of
from
two
to
seven
members
from
each
state
chosen
as
the
legislature
might
direct
and
paid
by
the
state
in
determining
all
questions
each
state
had
one
vote
delaware
thus
enjoying
the
same
weight
as
virginia
there
was
no
president
to
enforce
the
laws
congress
was
given
power
to
select
a
committee
of
thirteen
one
from
each
state
to
act
as
an
executive
body
when
it
was
not
in
session
but
this
device
on
being
tried
out
proved
a
failure
there
was
no
system
of
national
courts
to
which
citizens
and
states
could
appeal
for
the
protection
of
their
rights
or
through
which
they
could
compel
obedience
to
law
the
two
great
powers
of
government
military
and
financial
were
withheld
congress
it
is
true
could
authorize
expenditures
but
had
to
rely
upon
the
states
for
the
payment
of
contributions
to
meet
its
bills
it
could
also
order
the
establishment
of
an
army
but
it
could
only
request
the
states
to
supply
their
respective
quotas
of
soldiers
it
could
not
lay
taxes
nor
bring
any
pressure
to
bear
upon
a
single
citizen
in
the
whole
country
it
could
act
only
through
the
medium
of
the
state
governments
and
commercial
in
the
field
of
public
finance
the
disorders
were
pronounced
the
huge
debt
incurred
during
the
war
was
still
outstanding
congress
was
unable
to
pay
either
the
interest
or
the
principal
public
creditors
were
in
despair
as
the
market
value
of
their
bonds
sank
to
or
even
ten
cents
on
the
dollar
the
current
bills
of
congress
were
unpaid
as
some
one
complained
there
was
not
enough
money
in
the
treasury
to
buy
pen
and
ink
with
which
to
record
the
transactions
of
the
shadow
legislature
the
currency
was
in
utter
chaos
millions
of
dollars
in
notes
issued
by
congress
had
become
mere
trash
worth
a
cent
or
two
on
the
dollar
there
was
no
other
expression
of
contempt
so
forceful
as
the
popular
saying
not
worth
a
continental
to
make
matters
worse
several
of
the
states
were
pouring
new
streams
of
paper
money
from
the
press
almost
the
only
good
money
in
circulation
consisted
of
english
french
and
spanish
coins
and
the
public
was
even
defrauded
by
them
because
money
changers
were
busy
clipping
and
filing
away
the
metal
foreign
commerce
was
unsettled
the
entire
british
system
of
trade
discrimination
was
turned
against
the
americans
and
congress
having
no
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce
was
unable
to
retaliate
or
to
negotiate
treaties
which
it
could
enforce
domestic
commerce
was
impeded
by
the
jealousies
of
the
states
which
erected
tariff
barriers
against
their
neighbors
the
condition
of
the
currency
made
the
exchange
of
money
and
goods
extremely
difficult
and
as
if
to
increase
the
confusion
backward
states
enacted
laws
hindering
the
prompt
collection
of
debts
within
their
borders
an
evil
which
nothing
but
a
national
system
of
courts
could
cure
in
with
treaties
set
at
naught
by
the
states
the
laws
unenforced
the
treasury
empty
and
the
public
credit
gone
the
congress
of
the
united
states
fell
into
utter
disrepute
it
called
upon
the
states
to
pay
their
quotas
of
money
into
the
treasury
only
to
be
treated
with
contempt
even
its
own
members
looked
upon
it
as
a
solemn
futility
some
of
the
ablest
men
refused
to
accept
election
to
it
and
many
who
did
take
the
doubtful
honor
failed
to
attend
the
sessions
again
and
again
it
was
impossible
to
secure
a
quorum
for
the
transaction
of
business
of
the
state
the
state
governments
free
to
pursue
their
own
course
with
no
interference
from
without
had
almost
as
many
difficulties
as
the
congress
they
too
were
loaded
with
revolutionary
debts
calling
for
heavy
taxes
upon
an
already
restive
population
oppressed
by
their
financial
burdens
and
discouraged
by
the
fall
in
prices
which
followed
the
return
of
peace
the
farmers
of
several
states
joined
in
a
concerted
effort
and
compelled
their
legislatures
to
issue
large
sums
of
paper
money
the
currency
fell
in
value
but
nevertheless
it
was
forced
on
unwilling
creditors
to
square
old
accounts
in
every
part
of
the
country
legislative
action
fluctuated
violently
laws
were
made
one
year
only
to
be
repealed
the
next
and
reënacted
the
third
year
lands
were
sold
by
one
legislature
and
the
sales
were
canceled
by
its
successor
uncertainty
and
distrust
were
the
natural
consequences
men
of
substance
longed
for
some
power
that
would
forbid
states
to
issue
bills
of
credit
to
make
paper
money
legal
tender
in
payment
of
debts
or
to
impair
the
obligation
of
contracts
men
heavily
in
debt
on
the
other
hand
urged
even
more
drastic
action
against
creditors
so
great
did
the
discontent
of
the
farmers
in
new
hampshire
become
in
that
a
mob
surrounded
the
legislature
demanding
a
repeal
of
the
taxes
and
the
issuance
of
paper
money
it
was
with
difficulty
that
an
armed
rebellion
was
avoided
in
massachusetts
the
malcontents
under
the
leadership
of
daniel
shays
a
captain
in
the
revolutionary
army
organized
that
same
year
open
resistance
to
the
government
of
the
state
shays
and
his
followers
protested
against
the
conduct
of
creditors
in
foreclosing
mortgages
upon
the
farmers
against
the
lawyers
for
increasing
the
costs
of
legal
proceedings
against
the
senate
of
the
state
the
members
of
which
were
apportioned
among
the
towns
on
the
basis
of
the
amount
of
taxes
paid
against
heavy
taxes
and
against
the
refusal
of
the
legislature
to
issue
paper
money
they
seized
the
towns
of
worcester
and
springfield
and
broke
up
the
courts
of
justice
all
through
the
western
part
of
the
state
the
revolt
spread
sending
a
shock
of
alarm
to
every
center
and
section
of
the
young
republic
only
by
the
most
vigorous
action
was
governor
bowdoin
able
to
quell
the
uprising
and
when
that
task
was
accomplished
the
state
government
did
not
dare
to
execute
any
of
the
prisoners
because
they
had
so
many
sympathizers
moreover
bowdoin
and
several
members
of
the
legislature
who
had
been
most
zealous
in
their
attacks
on
the
insurgents
were
defeated
at
the
ensuing
election
the
need
of
national
assistance
for
state
governments
in
times
of
domestic
violence
was
everywhere
emphasized
by
men
who
were
opposed
to
revolutionary
acts
over
dangers
to
the
leading
american
citizens
watching
the
drift
of
affairs
were
slowly
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
the
new
ship
of
state
so
proudly
launched
a
few
years
before
was
careening
into
anarchy
the
facts
of
our
peace
and
independence
wrote
a
friend
of
washington
do
not
at
present
wear
so
promising
an
appearance
as
i
had
fondly
painted
in
my
mind
the
prejudices
jealousies
and
turbulence
of
the
people
at
times
almost
stagger
my
confidence
in
our
political
establishments
and
almost
occasion
me
to
think
that
they
will
show
themselves
unworthy
of
the
noble
prize
for
which
we
have
contended
washington
himself
was
profoundly
discouraged
on
hearing
of
rebellion
he
exclaimed
what
gracious
god
is
man
that
there
should
be
such
inconsistency
and
perfidiousness
in
his
conduct
it
is
but
the
other
day
that
we
were
shedding
our
blood
to
obtain
the
constitutions
under
which
we
now
live
constitutions
of
our
own
choice
and
making
and
now
we
are
unsheathing
our
sword
to
overturn
them
the
same
year
he
burst
out
in
a
lament
over
rumors
of
restoring
royal
government
i
am
told
that
even
respectable
characters
speak
of
a
monarchical
government
without
horror
from
thinking
proceeds
speaking
hence
to
acting
is
often
but
a
single
step
but
how
irresistible
and
tremendous
what
a
triumph
for
our
enemies
to
verify
their
predictions
what
a
triumph
for
the
advocates
of
despotism
to
find
that
we
are
incapable
of
governing
ourselves
attempts
some
the
congress
was
not
indifferent
to
the
events
that
disturbed
washington
on
the
contrary
it
put
forth
many
efforts
to
check
tendencies
so
dangerous
to
finance
commerce
industries
and
the
confederation
itself
in
even
before
the
treaty
of
peace
was
signed
the
congress
having
found
out
how
futile
were
its
taxing
powers
carried
a
resolution
of
amendment
to
the
articles
of
confederation
authorizing
the
levy
of
a
moderate
duty
on
imports
yet
this
mild
measure
was
rejected
by
the
states
two
years
later
the
congress
prepared
another
amendment
sanctioning
the
levy
of
duties
on
imports
to
be
collected
this
time
by
state
officers
and
applied
to
the
payment
of
the
public
debt
this
more
limited
proposal
designed
to
save
public
credit
likewise
failed
in
the
congress
made
a
third
appeal
to
the
states
for
help
declaring
that
they
had
been
so
irregular
and
so
negligent
in
paying
their
quotas
that
further
reliance
upon
that
mode
of
raising
revenues
was
dishonorable
and
dangerous
the
calling
of
a
constitutional
convention
and
washington
urge
the
attempts
at
reform
by
the
congress
were
accompanied
by
demand
for
both
within
and
without
that
body
a
convention
to
frame
a
new
plan
of
government
in
the
youthful
alexander
hamilton
realizing
the
weakness
of
the
articles
so
widely
discussed
proposed
a
general
convention
for
the
purpose
of
drafting
a
new
constitution
on
entirely
different
principles
with
tireless
energy
he
strove
to
bring
his
countrymen
to
his
view
washington
agreeing
with
him
on
every
point
declared
in
a
circular
letter
to
the
governors
that
the
duration
of
the
union
would
be
short
unless
there
was
lodged
somewhere
a
supreme
power
to
regulate
and
govern
the
general
concerns
of
the
confederated
republic
the
governor
of
massachusetts
disturbed
by
the
growth
of
discontent
all
about
him
suggested
to
the
state
legislature
in
the
advisability
of
a
national
convention
to
enlarge
the
powers
of
the
congress
the
legislature
approved
the
plan
but
did
not
press
it
to
a
conclusion
illustration
alexander
hamilton
annapolis
action
finally
came
from
the
south
the
virginia
legislature
taking
things
into
its
own
hands
called
a
conference
of
delegates
at
annapolis
to
consider
matters
of
taxation
and
commerce
when
the
convention
assembled
in
it
was
found
that
only
five
states
had
taken
the
trouble
to
send
representatives
the
leaders
were
deeply
discouraged
but
the
resourceful
hamilton
a
delegate
from
new
york
turned
the
affair
to
good
account
he
secured
the
adoption
of
a
resolution
calling
upon
the
congress
itself
to
summon
another
convention
to
meet
at
philadelphia
national
convention
called
the
congress
as
tardy
as
ever
at
last
decided
in
february
to
issue
the
call
fearing
drastic
changes
however
it
restricted
the
convention
to
the
sole
and
express
purpose
of
revising
the
articles
of
confederation
jealous
of
its
own
powers
it
added
that
any
alterations
proposed
should
be
referred
to
the
congress
and
the
states
for
their
approval
every
state
in
the
union
except
rhode
island
responded
to
this
call
indeed
some
of
the
states
having
the
annapolis
resolution
before
them
had
already
anticipated
the
congress
by
selecting
delegates
before
the
formal
summons
came

of

according
to
the
historian
hildreth
represented
in
a
marked
manner
the
talent
intelligence
and
especially
the
conservative
sentiment
of
the
country
the
framing
of
the
constitution
the
great
problems
before
the
convention
were
nine
in
number
shall
the
articles
of
confederation
be
revised
or
a
new
system
of
government
constructed
shall
the
government
be
founded
on
states
equal
in
power
as
under
the
articles
or
on
the
broader
and
deeper
foundation
of
population
what
direct
share
shall
the
people
have
in
the
election
of
national
officers
what
shall
be
the
qualifications
for
the
suffrage
how
shall
the
conflicting
interests
of
the
commercial
and
the
planting
states
be
balanced
so
as
to
safeguard
the
essential
rights
of
each
what
shall
be
the
form
of
the
new
government
what
powers
shall
be
conferred
on
it
how
shall
the
state
legislatures
be
restrained
from
their
attacks
on
property
rights
such
as
the
issuance
of
paper
money
shall
the
approval
of
all
the
states
be
necessary
as
under
the
articles
for
the
adoption
and
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
articles
or
a
new
government
the
moment
the
first
problem
was
raised
representatives
of
the
small
states
led
by
william
paterson
of
new
jersey
were
on
their
feet
they
feared
that
if
the
articles
were
overthrown
the
equality
and
rights
of
the
states
would
be
put
in
jeopardy
their
protest
was
therefore
vigorous
they
cited
the
call
issued
by
the
congress
in
summoning
the
convention
which
specifically
stated
that
they
were
assembled
for
the
sole
and
express
purpose
of
revising
the
articles
of
confederation
they
cited
also
their
instructions
from
their
state
legislatures
which
authorized
them
to
revise
and
amend
the
existing
scheme
of
government
not
to
make
a
revolution
in
it
to
depart
from
the
authorization
laid
down
by
the
congress
and
the
legislatures
would
be
to
exceed
their
powers
they
argued
and
to
betray
the
trust
reposed
in
them
by
their
countrymen
to
their
contentions
randolph
of
virginia
replied
when
the
salvation
of
the
republic
is
at
stake
it
would
be
treason
to
our
trust
not
to
propose
what
we
find
necessary
hamilton
reminding
the
delegates
that
their
work
was
still
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
states
frankly
said
that
on
the
point
of
their
powers
he
had
no
scruples
with
the
issue
clear
the
convention
cast
aside
the
articles
as
if
they
did
not
exist
and
proceeded
to
the
work
of
drawing
up
a
new
constitution
laying
its
foundations
on
such
principles
and
organizing
its
powers
in
such
form
as
to
the
delegates
seemed
most
likely
to
affect
their
safety
and
happiness
government
founded
on
states
or
on
people
the
defeated
in
their
attempt
to
limit
the
convention
to
a
mere
revision
of
the
articles
the
spokesmen
of
the
smaller
states
redoubled
their
efforts
to
preserve
the
equality
of
the
states
the
signal
for
a
radical
departure
from
the
articles
on
this
point
was
given
early
in
the
sessions
when
randolph
presented
the
virginia
plan
he
proposed
that
the
new
national
legislature
consist
of
two
houses
the
members
of
which
were
to
be
apportioned
among
the
states
according
to
their
wealth
or
free
white
population
as
the
convention
might
decide
this
plan
was
vehemently
challenged
paterson
of
new
jersey
flatly
avowed
that
neither
he
nor
his
state
would
ever
bow
to
such
tyranny
as
an
alternative
he
presented
the
new
jersey
plan
calling
for
a
national
legislature
of
one
house
representing
states
as
such
not
wealth
or
people
a
legislature
in
which
all

wilson
of
pennsylvania
on
behalf
of
the
more
populous
states
took
up
the
gauntlet
which
paterson
had
thrown
down
it
was
absurd
he
urged
for
men
in
one
state
to
have
the
same
weight
in
national
counsels
as
men
in
another
state
the
gentleman
from
new
jersey
he
said
is
candid
he
declares
his
opinion
boldly
i
will
be
equally
candid
i
will
never
confederate
on
his
principles
so
the
bitter
controversy
ran
on
through
many
exciting
sessions
greek
had
met
greek
the
convention
was
hopelessly
deadlocked
and
on
the
verge
of
dissolution
scarce
held
together
by
the
strength
of
a
hair
as
one
of
the
delegates
remarked
a
crash
was
averted
only
by
a
compromise
instead
of
a
congress
of
one
house
as
provided
by
the
articles
the
convention
agreed
upon
a
legislature
of
two
houses
in
the
senate
the
aspirations
of
the
small
states
were
to
be
satisfied
for
each
state
was
given
two
members
in
that
body
in
the
formation
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
larger
states
were
placated
for
it
was
agreed
that
the
members
of
that
chamber
were
to
be
apportioned
among
the
states
on
the
basis
of
population
counting
of
the
slaves
question
of
popular
the
method
of
selecting
federal
officers
and
members
of
congress
also
produced
an
acrimonious
debate
which
revealed
how
was
the
distrust
of
the
capacity
of
the
people
to
govern
themselves
few
there
were
who
believed
that
no
branch
of
the
government
should
be
elected
directly
by
the
voters
still
fewer
were
there
however
who
desired
to
see
all
branches
so
chosen
one
or
two
even
expressed
a
desire
for
a
monarchy
the
dangers
of
democracy
were
stressed
by
gerry
of
massachusetts
all
the
evils
we
experience
flow
from
an
excess
of
democracy
the
people
do
not
want
virtue
but
are
the
dupes
of
pretended
patriots
i
have
been
too
republican
heretofore
but
have
been
taught
by
experience
the
danger
of
a
leveling
spirit
to
the
democratic
licentiousness
of
the
state
legislatures
randolph
sought
to
oppose
a
firm
senate
to
check
the
excesses
of
popular
government
charles
pinckney
of
south
carolina
declared
that
no
one
should
be
elected
president
who
was
not
worth
and
that
high
property
qualifications
should
be
placed
on
members
of
congress
and
judges
other
members
of
the
convention
were
stoutly
opposed
to
such
notions
of
government
franklin
and
wilson
both
from
pennsylvania
vigorously
championed
popular
election
while
men
like
madison
insisted
that
at
least
one
part
of
the
government
should
rest
on
the
broad
foundation
of
the
people
out
of
this
clash
of
opinion
also
came
compromise
one
branch
the
house
of
representatives
it
was
agreed
was
to
be
elected
directly
by
the
voters
while
the
senators
were
to
be
elected
indirectly
by
the
state
legislatures
the
president
was
to
be
chosen
by
electors
selected
as
the
legislatures
of
the
states
might
determine
and
the
judges
of
the
federal
courts
supreme
and
inferior
by
the
president
and
the
senate
question
of
the
the
battle
over
the
suffrage
was
sharp
but
brief
gouverneur
morris
proposed
that
only
land
owners
should
be
permitted
to
vote
madison
replied
that
the
state
legislatures
which
had
made
so
much
trouble
with
radical
laws
were
elected
by
freeholders
after
the
debate
the
delegates
unable
to
agree
on
any
property
limitations
on
the
suffrage
decided
that
the
house
of
representatives
should
be
elected
by
voters
having
the
qualifications
requisite
for
electors
of
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
state
legislature
thus
they
accepted
the
suffrage
provisions
of
the
states
balance
between
the
planting
and
the
commercial
after
the
debates
had
gone
on
for
a
few
weeks
madison
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
real
division
in
the
convention
was
not
between
the
large
and
the
small
states
but
between
the
planting
section
founded
on
slave
labor
and
the
commercial
north
thus
he
anticipated
by
nearly
of
a
century
the
irrepressible
conflict
the
planting
states
had
neither
the
free
white
population
nor
the
wealth
of
the
north
there
were
counting
delaware
six
of
them
as
against
seven
commercial
states
dependent
for
their
prosperity
mainly
upon
the
sale
of
tobacco
rice
and
other
staples
abroad
they
feared
that
congress
might
impose
restraints
upon
their
enterprise
being
weaker
in
numbers
they
were
afraid
that
the
majority
might
lay
an
unfair
burden
of
taxes
upon
them
and
the
southern
members
of
the
convention
were
therefore
very
anxious
to
secure
for
their
section
the
largest
possible
representation
in
congress
and
at
the
same
time
to
restrain
the
taxing
power
of
that
body
two
devices
were
thought
adapted
to
these
ends
one
was
to
count
the
slaves
as
people
when
apportioning
representatives
among
the
states
according
to
their
respective
populations
the
other
was
to
provide
that
direct
taxes
should
be
apportioned
among
the
states
in
proportion
not
to
their
wealth
but
to
the
number
of
their
free
white
inhabitants
for
obvious
reasons
the
northern
delegates
objected
to
these
proposals
once
more
a
compromise
proved
to
be
the
solution
it
was
agreed
that
not
all
the
slaves
but
of
them
should
be
counted
for
both
purposes
representation
and
direct
taxation
and
the
slave
southern
interests
were
also
involved
in
the
project
to
confer
upon
congress
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
to
the
manufacturing
and
trading
states
this
was
essential
it
would
prevent
interstate
tariffs
and
trade
jealousies
it
would
enable
congress
to
protect
american
manufactures
and
to
break
down
by
appropriate
retaliations
foreign
discriminations
against
american
commerce
to
the
south
the
proposal
was
menacing
because
tariffs
might
interfere
with
the
free
exchange
of
the
produce
of
plantations
in
european
markets
and
navigation
acts
might
confine
the
carrying
trade
to
american
that
is
northern
ships
the
importation
of
slaves
moreover
it
was
feared
might
be
heavily
taxed
or
immediately
prohibited
altogether
the
result
of
this
and
related
controversies
was
a
debate
on
the
merits
of
slavery
gouverneur
morris
delivered
his
mind
and
heart
on
that
subject
denouncing
slavery
as
a
nefarious
institution
and
the
curse
of
heaven
on
the
states
in
which
it
prevailed
mason
of
virginia
a
slaveholder
himself
was
hardly
less
outspoken
saying
slavery
discourages
arts
and
manufactures
the
poor
despise
labor
when
performed
by
slaves
they
prevent
the
migration
of
whites
who
really
strengthen
and
enrich
a
country
the
system
however
had
its
defenders
representatives
from
south
carolina
argued
that
their
entire
economic
life
rested
on
slave
labor
and
that
the
high
death
rate
in
the
rice
swamps
made
continuous
importation
necessary
ellsworth
of
connecticut
took
the
ground
that
the
convention
should
not
meddle
with
slavery
the
morality
or
wisdom
of
slavery
he
said
are
considerations
belonging
to
the
states
what
enriches
a
part
enriches
the
whole
to
the
future
he
turned
an
untroubled
face
as
population
increases
poor
laborers
will
be
so
plenty
as
to
render
slaves
useless
slavery
in
time
will
not
be
a
speck
in
our
country
virginia
and
north
carolina
already
overstocked
with
slaves
favored
prohibiting
the
traffic
in
them
but
south
carolina
was
adamant
she
must
have
fresh
supplies
of
slaves
or
she
would
not
federate
so
it
was
agreed
that
while
congress
might
regulate
foreign
trade
by
majority
vote
the
importation
of
slaves
should
not
be
forbidden
before
the
lapse
of
twenty
years
and
that
any
import
tax
should
not
exceed
a
head
at
the
same
time
in
connection
with
the
regulation
of
foreign
trade
it
was
stipulated
that
a
vote
in
the
senate
should
be
necessary
in
the
ratification
of
treaties
a
further
concession
to
the
south
was
made
in
the
provision
for
the
return
of
runaway
slaves
a
provision
also
useful
in
the
north
where
indentured
servants
were
about
as
troublesome
as
slaves
in
escaping
from
their
masters
form
of
the
as
to
the
details
of
the
frame
of
government
and
the
grand
principles
involved
the
opinion
of
the
convention
ebbed
and
flowed
decisions
being
taken
in
the
heat
of
debate
only
to
be
revoked
and
taken
again
there
was
general
agreement
that
there
should
be
an
executive
branch
for
reliance
upon
congress
to
enforce
its
own
laws
and
treaties
had
been
a
broken
reed
on
the
character
and
functions
of
the
executive
however
there
were
many
views
the
new
jersey
plan
called
for
a
council
selected
by
the
congress
the
virginia
plan
provided
that
the
executive
branch
should
be
chosen
by
the
congress
but
did
not
state
whether
it
should
be
composed
of
one
or
several
persons
on
this
matter
the
convention
voted
first
one
way
and
then
another
finally
it
agreed
on
a
single
executive
chosen
indirectly
by
electors
selected
as
the
state
legislatures
might
decide
serving
for
four
years
subject
to
impeachment
and
endowed
with
regal
powers
in
the
command
of
the
army
and
the
navy
and
in
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
legislative
branch
after
the
convention
had
made
the
great
compromise
between
the
large
and
small
commonwealths
by
giving
representation
to
states
in
the
senate
and
to
population
in
the
house
the
question
of
methods
of
election
had
to
be
decided
as
to
the
house
of
representatives
it
was
readily
agreed
that
the
members
should
be
elected
by
direct
popular
vote
there
was
also
easy
agreement
on
the
proposition
that
a
strong
senate
was
needed
to
check
the
turbulence
of
the
lower
house
four
devices
were
finally
selected
to
accomplish
this
purpose
in
the
first
place
the
senators
were
not
to
be
chosen
directly
by
the
voters
but
by
the
legislatures
of
the
states
thus
removing
their
election
one
degree
from
the
populace
in
the
second
place
their
term
was
fixed
at
six
years
instead
of
two
as
in
the
case
of
the
house
in
the
third
place
provision
was
made
for
continuity
by
having
only
of
the
members
go
out
at
a
time
while
remained
in
service
finally
it
was
provided
that
senators
must
be
at
least
thirty
years
old
while
representatives
need
be
only
the
need
for
federal
courts
to
carry
out
the
law
was
hardly
open
to
debate
the
feebleness
of
the
articles
of
confederation
was
in
a
large
measure
attributed
to
the
want
of
a
judiciary
to
hold
states
and
individuals
in
obedience
to
the
laws
and
treaties
of
the
union
nevertheless
on
this
point
the
advocates
of
states
rights
were
extremely
sensitive
they
looked
with
distrust
upon
judges
appointed
at
the
national
capital
and
emancipated
from
local
interests
and
traditions
they
remembered
with
what
insistence
they
had
claimed
against
britain
the
right
of
local
trial
by
jury
and
with
what
consternation
they
had
viewed
the
proposal
to
make
colonial
judges
independent
of
the
assemblies
in
the
matter
of
their
salaries
reluctantly
they
yielded
to
the
demand
for
federal
courts
consenting
at
first
only
to
a
supreme
court
to
review
cases
heard
in
lower
state
courts
and
finally
to
such
additional
inferior
courts
as
congress
might
deem
necessary
system
of
checks
and
it
is
thus
apparent
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
in
shaping
the
form
of
government
arranged
for
a
distribution
of
power
among
three
branches
executive
legislative
and
judicial
strictly
speaking
we
might
say
four
branches
for
the
legislature
or
congress
was
composed
of
two
houses
elected
in
different
ways
and
one
of
them
the
senate
was
made
a
check
on
the
president
through
its
power
of
ratifying
treaties
and
appointments
the
accumulation
of
all
powers
legislative
executive
and
judicial
in
the
same
hands
wrote
madison
whether
of
one
a
few
or
many
and
whether
hereditary
or
elective
may
justly
be
pronounced
the
very
definition
of
tyranny
the
devices
which
the
convention
adopted
to
prevent
such
a
centralization
of
authority
were
exceedingly
ingenious
and
well
calculated
to
accomplish
the
purposes
of
the
authors
the
legislature
consisted
of
two
houses
the
members
of
which
were
to
be
apportioned
on
a
different
basis
elected
in
different
ways
and
to
serve
for
different
terms
a
veto
on
all
its
acts
was
vested
in
a
president
elected
in
a
manner
not
employed
in
the
choice
of
either
branch
of
the
legislature
serving
for
four
years
and
subject
to
removal
only
by
the
difficult
process
of
impeachment
after
a
law
had
run
the
gantlet
of
both
houses
and
the
executive
it
was
subject
to
interpretation
and
annulment
by
the
judiciary
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
consent
of
the
senate
and
serving
for
life
thus
it
was
made
almost
impossible
for
any
political
party
to
get
possession
of
all
branches
of
the
government
at
a
single
popular
election
as
hamilton
remarked
the
friends
of
good
government
considered
every
institution
calculated
to
restrain
the
excess
of
law
making
and
to
keep
things
in
the
same
state
in
which
they
happen
to
be
at
any
given
period
as
more
likely
to
do
good
than
harm
powers
of
the
federal
on
the
question
of
the
powers
to
be
conferred
upon
the
new
government
there
was
less
occasion
for
a
serious
dispute
even
the
delegates
from
the
small
states
agreed
with
those
from
massachusetts
pennsylvania
and
virginia
that
new
powers
should
be
added
to
those
intrusted
to
congress
by
the
articles
of
confederation
the
new
jersey
plan
as
well
as
the
virginia
plan
recognized
this
fact
some
of
the
delegates
like
hamilton
and
madison
even
proposed
to
give
congress
a
general
legislative
authority
covering
all
national
matters
but
others
frightened
by
the
specter
of
nationalism
insisted
on
specifying
each
power
to
be
conferred
and
finally
carried
the
day
and
there
were
none
bold
enough
to
dissent
from
the
proposition
that
revenue
must
be
provided
to
pay
current
expenses
and
discharge
the
public
debt
when
once
the
dispute
over
the
apportionment
of
direct
taxes
among
the
slave
states
was
settled
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
decide
that
congress
should
have
power
to
lay
and
collect
taxes
duties
imposts
and
excises
in
this
way
the
national
government
was
freed
from
dependence
upon
stubborn
and
tardy
legislatures
and
enabled
to
collect
funds
directly
from
citizens
there
were
likewise
none
bold
enough
to
contend
that
the
anarchy
of
state
tariffs
and
trade
discriminations
should
be
longer
endured
when
the
fears
of
the
planting
states
were
allayed
and
the
bargain
over
the
importation
of
slaves
was
reached
the
convention
vested
in
congress
the
power
to
regulate
foreign
and
interstate
commerce
the
necessity
for
national
defense
was
realized
though
the
fear
of
huge
military
establishments
was
equally
present
the
old
practice
of
relying
on
quotas
furnished
by
the
state
legislatures
was
completely
discredited
as
in
the
case
of
taxes
a
direct
authority
over
citizens
was
demanded
congress
was
therefore
given
full
power
to
raise
and
support
armies
and
a
navy
it
could
employ
the
state
militia
when
desirable
but
it
could
at
the
same
time
maintain
a
regular
army
and
call
directly
upon
all
males
if
the
nature
of
a
crisis
was
thought
to
require
it
necessary
and
proper
to
the
specified
power
vested
in
congress
by
the
constitution
the
advocates
of
a
strong
national
government
added
a
general
clause
authorizing
it
to
make
all
laws
necessary
and
proper
for
carrying
into
effect
any
and
all
of
the
enumerated
powers
this
clause
interpreted
by
that
master
mind
chief
justice
marshall
was
later
construed
to
confer
powers
as
wide
as
the
requirements
of
a
vast
country
spanning
a
continent
and
taking
its
place
among
the
mighty
nations
of
the
earth
on
the
framing
a
government
and
endowing
it
with
large
powers
were
by
no
means
the
sole
concern
of
the
convention
its
very
existence
had
been
due
quite
as
much
to
the
conduct
of
the
state
legislatures
as
to
the
futilities
of
a
paralyzed
continental
congress
in
every
state
explains
marshall
in
his
of
there
was
a
party
of
men
who
had
marked
out
for
themselves
a
more
indulgent
course
viewing
with
extreme
tenderness
the
case
of
the
debtor
their
efforts
were
unceasingly
directed
to
his
relief
to
exact
a
faithful
compliance
with
contracts
was
in
their
opinion
a
harsh
measure
which
the
people
could
not
bear
they
were
uniformly
in
favor
of
relaxing
the
administration
of
justice
of
affording
facilities
for
the
payment
of
debts
or
of
suspending
their
collection
and
remitting
taxes
the
legislatures
under
the
dominance
of
these
men
had
enacted
paper
money
laws
enabling
debtors
to
discharge
their
obligations
more
easily
the
convention
put
an
end
to
such
practices
by
providing
that
no
state
should
emit
bills
of
credit
or
make
anything
but
gold
or
silver
legal
tender
in
the
payment
of
debts
the
state
legislatures
had
enacted
laws
allowing
men
to
pay
their
debts
by
turning
over
to
creditors
land
or
personal
property
they
had
repealed
the
charter
of
an
endowed
college
and
taken
the
management
from
the
hands
of
the
lawful
trustees
and
they
had
otherwise
interfered
with
the
enforcement
of
private
agreements
the
convention
taking
notice
of
such
matters
inserted
a
clause
forbidding
states
to
impair
the
obligation
of
contracts
the
more
venturous
of
the
radicals
had
in
massachusetts
raised
the
standard
of
revolt
against
the
authorities
of
the
state
the
convention
answered
by
a
brief
sentence
to
the
effect
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
be
equipped
with
a
regular
army
would
send
troops
to
suppress
domestic
insurrections
whenever
called
upon
by
the
legislature
or
if
it
was
not
in
session
by
the
governor
of
the
state
to
make
sure
that
the
restrictions
on
the
states
would
not
be
dead
letters
the
federal
constitution
laws
and
treaties
were
made
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
to
be
enforced
whenever
necessary
by
a
national
judiciary
and
executive
against
violations
on
the
part
of
any
state
authorities
for
ratification
and
when
the
frame
of
government
had
been
determined
the
powers
to
be
vested
in
it
had
been
enumerated
and
the
restrictions
upon
the
states
had
been
written
into
the
bond
there
remained
three
final
questions
how
shall
the
constitution
be
ratified
what
number
of
states
shall
be
necessary
to
put
it
into
effect
how
shall
it
be
amended
in
the
future
on
the
first
point
the
mandate
under
which
the
convention
was
sitting
seemed
positive
the
articles
of
confederation
were
still
in
effect
they
provided
that
amendments
could
be
made
only
by
unanimous
adoption
in
congress
and
the
approval
of
all
the
states
as
if
to
give
force
to
this
provision
of
law
the
call
for
the
convention
had
expressly
stated
that
all
alterations
and
revisions
should
be
reported
to
congress
for
adoption
or
rejection
congress
itself
to
transmit
the
document
thereafter
to
the
states
for
their
review
to
have
observed
the
strict
letter
of
the
law
would
have
defeated
the
purposes
of
the
delegates
because
congress
and
the
state
legislatures
were
openly
hostile
to
such
drastic
changes
as
had
been
made
unanimous
ratification
as
events
proved
would
have
been
impossible
therefore
the
delegates
decided
that
the
constitution
should
be
sent
to
congress
with
the
recommendation
that
it
in
turn
transmit
the
document
not
to
the
state
legislatures
but
to
conventions
held
in
the
states
for
the
special
object
of
deciding
upon
ratification
this
process
was
followed
it
was
their
belief
that
special
conventions
would
be
more
friendly
than
the
state
legislatures
the
convention
was
equally
positive
in
dealing
with
the
problem
of
the
number
of
states
necessary
to
establish
the
new
constitution
attempts
to
change
the
articles
had
failed
because
amendment
required
the
approval
of
every
state
and
there
was
always
at
least
one
recalcitrant
member
of
the
union
the
opposition
to
a
new
constitution
was
undoubtedly
formidable
rhode
island
had
even
refused
to
take
part
in
framing
it
and
her
hostility
was
deep
and
open
so
the
convention
cast
aside
the
provision
of
the
articles
of
confederation
which
required
unanimous
approval
for
any
change
in
the
plan
of
government
it
decreed
that
the
new
constitution
should
go
into
effect
when
ratified
by
nine
states
in
providing
for
future
changes
in
the
constitution
itself
the
convention
also
thrust
aside
the
old
rule
of
unanimous
approval
and
decided
that
an
amendment
could
be
made
on
a
vote
in
both
houses
of
congress
and
ratification
by
of
the
states
this
change
was
of
profound
significance
every
state
agreed
to
be
bound
in
the
future
by
amendments
duly
adopted
even
in
case
it
did
not
approve
them
itself
america
in
this
way
set
out
upon
the
high
road
that
led
from
a
league
of
states
to
a
nation
the
struggle
over
ratification
on
september
the
constitution
having
been
finally
drafted
in
clear
and
simple
language
a
model
to
all
makers
of
fundamental
law
was
adopted
the
convention
after
nearly
four
months
of
debate
in
secret
session
flung
open
the
doors
and
presented
to
the
americans
the
finished
plan
for
the
new
government
then
the
great
debate
passed
to
the
people
storms
of
criticism
at
once
descended
upon
the

usurpation

refused

most

excellent

correspondence
editorials

letters

urged
their

of

house

headed

also
been

strengthened

expressed
opinions
both
for
and
against

but
he
had
been
out

country
acting
as
the
minister
at
paris
when
the
constitution
was
drafted
and
ratified
opposition
to
the
inauguration
of
washington
amid
the
plaudits
of
his
countrymen
did
not
set
at
rest
all
the
political
turmoil
which
had
been
aroused
by
the
angry
contest
over
ratification
the
interesting
nature
of
the
question
wrote
john
marshall
the
equality
of
the
parties
the
animation
produced
inevitably
by
ardent
debate
had
a
necessary
tendency
to
embitter
the
dispositions
of
the
vanquished
and
to
fix
more
deeply
in
many
bosoms
their
prejudices
against
a
plan
of
government
in
opposition
to
which
all
their
passions
were
enlisted
the
leaders
gathered
around
washington
were
well
aware
of
the
excited
state
of
the
country
they
saw
rhode
island
and
north
carolina
still
outside
of
the
union
they
knew
by
what
small
margins
the
constitution
had
been
approved
in
the
great
states
of
massachusetts
virginia
and
new
york
they
were
equally
aware
that
a
majority
of
the
state
conventions
in
yielding
reluctant
approval
to
the
constitution
had
drawn
a
number
of
amendments
for
immediate
submission
to
the
states
first
amendments
a
bill
of
to
meet
the
opposition
madison
proposed
and
the
first
congress
adopted
a
series
of
amendments
to
the
constitution
ten
of
them
were
soon
ratified
and
became
in
a
part
of
the
law
of
the
land
these
amendments
provided
among
other
things
that
congress
could
make
no
law
respecting
the
establishment
of
religion
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press
or
the
right
of
the
people
peaceably
to
assemble
and
petition
the
government
for
a
redress
of
grievances
they
also
guaranteed
indictment
by
grand
jury
and
trial
by
jury
for
all
persons
charged
by
federal
officers
with
serious
crimes
to
reassure
those
who
still
feared
that
local
rights
might
be
invaded
by
the
federal
government
the
tenth
amendment
expressly
provided
that
the
powers
not
delegated
to
the
united
states
by
the
constitution
nor
prohibited
by
it
to
the
states
are
reserved
to
the
states
respectively
or
to
the
people
seven
years
later
the
eleventh
amendment
was
written
in
the
same
spirit
as
the
first
ten
after
a
heated
debate
over
the
action
of
the
supreme
court
in
permitting
a
citizen
to
bring
a
suit
against
the
sovereign
state
of
georgia
the
new
amendment
was
designed
to
protect
states
against
the
federal
judiciary
by
forbidding
it
to
hear
any
case
in
which
a
state
was
sued
by
a
citizen
the
national
paper
declarations
of
rights
however
paid
no
bills
to
this
task
hamilton
turned
all
his
splendid
genius
at
the
very
outset
he
addressed
himself
to
the
problem
of
the
huge
public
debt
daily
mounting
as
the
unpaid
interest
accumulated
in
a
on
public
under
date
of
january
one
of
the
first
and
greatest
of
american
state
papers
he
laid
before
congress
the
outlines
of
his
plan
he
proposed
that
the
federal
government
should
call
in
all
the
old
bonds
certificates
of
indebtedness
and
other
promises
to
pay
which
had
been
issued
by
the
congress
since
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
these
national
obligations
he
urged
should
be
put
into
one
consolidated
debt
resting
on
the
credit
of
the
united
states
to
the
holders
of
the
old
paper
should
be
issued
new
bonds
drawing
interest
at
fixed
rates
this
process
was
called
funding
the
debt
such
a
provision
for
the
support
of
public
credit
hamilton
insisted
would
satisfy
creditors
restore
landed
property
to
its
former
value
and
furnish
new
resources
to
agriculture
and
commerce
in
the
form
of
credit
and
capital
and
funding
of
state
hamilton
then
turned
to
the
obligations
incurred
by
the
several
states
in
support
of
the
revolution
these
debts
he
proposed
to
add
to
the
national
debt
they
were
to
be
assumed
by
the
united
states
government
and
placed
on
the
same
secure
foundation
as
the
continental
debt
this
measure
he
defended
not
merely
on
grounds
of
national
honor
it
would
as
he
foresaw
give
strength
to
the
new
national
government
by
making
all
public
creditors
men
of
substance
in
their
several
communities
look
to
the
federal
rather
than
the
state
government
for
the
satisfaction
of
their
claims
at
face
on
the
question
of
the
terms
of
consolidation
assumption
and
funding
hamilton
had
a
firm
conviction
that
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
the
continental
and
state
bonds
had
passed
out
of
the
hands
of
those
who
had
originally
subscribed
their
funds
to
the
support
of
the
government
or
had
sold
supplies
for
the
revolutionary
army
was
well
known
it
was
also
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
a
very
large
part
of
these
bonds
had
been
bought
by
speculators
at
ruinous
figures
ten
twenty
and
thirty
cents
on
the
dollar
accordingly
it
had
been
suggested
even
in
very
respectable
quarters
that
a
discrimination
should
be
made
between
original
holders
and
speculative
purchasers
some
who
held
this
opinion
urged
that
the
speculators
who
had
paid
nominal
sums
for
their
bonds
should
be
reimbursed
for
their
outlays
and
the
original
holders
paid
the
difference
others
said
that
the
government
should
scale
the
debt
by
redeeming
not
at
full
value
but
at
a
figure
reasonably
above
the
market
price
against
the
proposition
hamilton
set
his
face
like
flint
he
maintained
that
the
government
was
honestly
bound
to
redeem
every
bond
at
its
face
value
although
the
difficulty
of
securing
revenue
made
necessary
a
lower
rate
of
interest
on
a
part
of
the
bonds
and
the
deferring
of
interest
on
another
part
and
assumption
there
was
little
difficulty
in
securing
the
approval
of
both
houses
of
congress
for
the
funding
of
the
national
debt
at
full
value
the
bill
for
the
assumption
of
state
debts
however
brought
the
sharpest
division
of
opinions
to
the
southern
members
of
congress
assumption
was
a
gross
violation
of
states
rights
without
any
warrant
in
the
constitution
and
devised
in
the
interest
of
northern
speculators
who
anticipating
assumption
and
funding
had
bought
up
at
low
prices
the
southern
bonds
and
other
promises
to
pay
new
england
on
the
other
hand
was
strongly
in
favor
of
assumption
several
representatives
from
that
section
were
rash
enough
to
threaten
a
dissolution
of
the
union
if
the
bill
was
defeated
to
this
dispute
was
added
an
equally
bitter
quarrel
over
the
location
of
the
national
capital
then
temporarily
at
new
york
city
illustration
first
united
states
bank
at
philadelphia
a
deadlock
accompanied
by
the
most
surly
feelings
on
both
sides
threatened
the
very
existence
of
the
young
government
washington
and
hamilton
were
thoroughly
alarmed
hearing
of
the
extremity
to
which
the
contest
had
been
carried
and
acting
on
the
appeal
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
jefferson
intervened
at
this
point
by
skillful
management
at
a
good
dinner
he
brought
the
opposing
leaders
together
and
thus
once
more
as
on
many
other
occasions
peace
was
purchased
and
the
union
saved
by
compromise
the
bargain
this
time
consisted
of
an
exchange
of
votes
for
assumption
in
return
for
votes
for
the
capital
enough
southern
members
voted
for
assumption
to
pass
the
bill
and
a
majority
was
mustered
in
favor
of
building
the
capital
on
the
banks
of
the
potomac
after
locating
it
for
a
period
at
philadelphia
to
satisfy
pennsylvania
members
united
states
encouraged
by
the
success
of
his
funding
and
assumption
measures
hamilton
laid
before
congress
a
project
for
a
great
united
states
bank
he
proposed
that
a
private
corporation
be
chartered
by
congress
authorized
to
raise
a
capital
stock
of
in
new
six
per
cent
federal
bonds
and
in
specie
and
empowered
to
issue
paper
currency
under
proper
safeguards
many
advantages
hamilton
contended
would
accrue
to
the
government
from
this
institution
the
price
of
the
government
bonds
would
be
increased
thus
enhancing
public
credit
a
national
currency
would
be
created
of
uniform
value
from
one
end
of
the
land
to
the
other
the
branches
of
the
bank
in
various
cities
would
make
easy
the
exchange
of
funds
so
vital
to
commercial
transactions
on
a
national
scale
finally
through
the
issue
of
bank
notes
the
money
capital
available
for
agriculture
and
industry
would
be
increased
thus
stimulating
business
enterprise
jefferson
hotly
attacked
the
bank
on
the
ground
that
congress
had
no
power
whatever
under
the
constitution
to
charter
such
a
private
corporation
hamilton
defended
it
with
great
cogency
washington
after
weighing
all
opinions
decided
in
favor
of
the
proposal
in
the
bill
establishing
the
first
united
states
bank
for
a
period
of
twenty
years
became
a
law
protective
a
third
part
of
hamilton
program
was
the
protection
of
american
industries
the
first
revenue
act
of
though
designed
primarily
to
bring
money
into
the
empty
treasury
declared
in
favor
of
the
principle
the
following
year
washington
referred
to
the
subject
in
his
address
to
congress
thereupon
hamilton
was
instructed
to
prepare
recommendations
for
legislative
action
the
result
after
a
delay
of
more
than
a
year
was
his
on
another
state
paper
worthy
in
closeness
of
reasoning
and
keenness
of
understanding
of
a
place
beside
his
report
on
public
credit
hamilton
based
his
argument
on
the
broadest
national
grounds
the
protective
tariff
would
by
encouraging
the
building
of
factories
create
a
home
market
for
the
produce
of
farms
and
plantations
by
making
the
united
states
independent
of
other
countries
in
times
of
peace
it
would
double
its
security
in
time
of
war
by
making
use
of
the
labor
of
women
and
children
it
would
turn
to
the
production
of
goods
persons
otherwise
idle
or
only
partly
employed
by
increasing
the
trade
between
the
north
and
south
it
would
strengthen
the
links
of
union
and
add
to
political
ties
those
of
commerce
and
intercourse
the
revenue
measure
of
bore
the
impress
of
these
arguments
the
rise
of
political
parties
over
hamilton
hamilton
plans
touching
deeply
as
they
did
the
resources
of
individuals
and
the
interests
of
the
states
awakened
alarm
and
opposition
funding
at
face
value
said
his
critics
was
a
government
favor
to
speculators
the
assumption
of
state
debts
was
a
deep
design
to
undermine
the
state
governments
congress
had
no
constitutional
power
to
create
a
bank
the
law
creating
the
bank
merely
allowed
a
private
corporation
to
make
paper
money
and
lend
it
at
a
high
rate
of
interest
and
the
tariff
was
a
tax
on
land
and
labor
for
the
benefit
of
manufacturers
hamilton
reply
to
this
bill
of
indictment
was
simple
and
straightforward
some
rascally
speculators
had
profited
from
the
funding
of
the
debt
at
face
value
but
that
was
only
an
incident
in
the
restoration
of
public
credit
in
view
of
the
jealousies
of
the
states
it
was
a
good
thing
to
reduce
their
powers
and
pretensions
the
constitution
was
not
to
be
interpreted
narrowly
but
in
the
full
light
of
national
needs
the
bank
would
enlarge
the
amount
of
capital
so
sorely
needed
to
start
up
american
industries
giving
markets
to
farmers
and
planters
the
tariff
by
creating
a
home
market
and
increasing
opportunities
for
employment
would
benefit
both
land
and
labor
out
of
such
wise
policies
firmly
pursued
by
the
government
he
concluded
were
bound
to
come
strength
and
prosperity
for
the
new
government
at
home
credit
and
power
abroad
this
view
washington
fully
indorsed
adding
the
weight
of
his
great
name
to
the
inherent
merits
of
the
measures
adopted
under
his
administration
sharpness
of
the
partisan
as
a
result
of
the
clash
of
opinion
the
people
of
the
country
gradually
divided
into
two
parties
federalists
and
the
former
led
by
hamilton
the
latter
by
jefferson
the
strength
of
the
federalists
lay
in
the
cities
boston
providence
hartford
new
york
philadelphia
charleston
among
the
manufacturing
financial
and
commercial
groups
of
the
population
who
were
eager
to
extend
their
business
operations
the
strength
of
the
lay
mainly
among
the
farmers
who
feared
the
growth
of
what
they
called
a
money
power
and
planters
in
all
sections
who
feared
the
dominance
of
commercial
and
manufacturing
interests
the
farming
and
planting
south
outside
of
the
few
towns
finally
presented
an
almost
solid
front
against
assumption
the
bank
and
the
tariff
the
conflict
between
the
parties
grew
steadily
in
bitterness
despite
the
conciliatory
and
engaging
manner
in
which
hamilton
presented
his
cause
in
his
state
papers
and
despite
the
constant
efforts
of
washington
to
soften
the
asperity
of
the
contestants
leadership
and
doctrines
of
the
party
dispute
had
not
gone
far
before
the
opponents
of
the
administration
began
to
look
to
jefferson
as
their
leader
some
of
hamilton
measures
he
had
approved
declaring
afterward
that
he
did
not
at
the
time
understand
their
significance
others
particularly
the
bank
he
fiercely
assailed
more
than
once
he
and
hamilton
shaking
violently
with
anger
attacked
each
other
at
cabinet
meetings
and
nothing
short
of
the
grave
and
dignified
pleas
of
washington
prevented
an
early
and
open
break
between
them
in
it
finally
came
jefferson
resigned
as
secretary
of
state
and
retired
to
his
home
in
virginia
to
assume
through
correspondence
and
negotiation
the
leadership
of
the
steadily
growing
party
of
opposition
shy
and
modest
in
manner
halting
in
speech
disliking
the
turmoil
of
public
debate
and
deeply
interested
in
science
and
philosophy
jefferson
was
not
very
well
fitted
for
the
strenuous
life
of
political
contest
nevertheless
he
was
an
ambitious
and
shrewd
negotiator
he
was
also
by
honest
opinion
and
matured
conviction
the
exact
opposite
of
hamilton
the
latter
believed
in
a
strong
active
government
vigorously
compelling
in
all
its
branches
jefferson
looked
upon
such
government
as
dangerous
to
the
liberties
of
citizens
and
openly
avowed
his
faith
in
the
desirability
of
occasional
popular
uprisings
hamilton
distrusted
the
people
your
people
is
a
great
beast
he
is
reported
to
have
said
jefferson
professed
his
faith
in
the
people
with
an
abandon
that
was
considered
reckless
in
his
time
on
economic
matters
the
opinions
of
the
two
leaders
were
also
hopelessly
at
variance
hamilton
while
cherishing
agriculture
desired
to
see
america
a
great
commercial
and
industrial
nation
jefferson
was
equally
set
against
this
course
for
his
country
he
feared
the
accumulation
of
riches
and
the
growth
of
a
large
urban
working
class
the
mobs
of
great
cities
he
said
are
sores
on
the
body
politic
artisans
are
usually
the
dangerous
element
that
make
revolutions
workshops
should
be
kept
in
europe
and
with
them
the
artisans
with
their
insidious
morals
and
manners
the
only
substantial
foundation
for
a
republic
jefferson
believed
to
be
agriculture
the
spirit
of
independence
could
be
kept
alive
only
by
free
farmers
owning
the
land
they
tilled
and
looking
to
the
sun
in
heaven
and
the
labor
of
their
hands
for
their
sustenance
trusting
as
he
did
in
the
innate
goodness
of
human
nature
when
nourished
on
a
free
soil
jefferson
advocated
those
measures
calculated
to
favor
agriculture
and
to
enlarge
the
rights
of
persons
rather
than
the
powers
of
government
thus
he
became
the
champion
of
the
individual
against
the
interference
of
the
government
and
an
ardent
advocate
of
freedom
of
the
press
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
scientific
inquiry
it
was
accordingly
no
mere
factious
spirit
that
drove
him
into
opposition
to
hamilton
whisky
the
political
agitation
of
the
was
accompanied
by
an
armed
revolt
against
the
government
in
the
occasion
for
this
uprising
was
another
of
hamilton
measures
a
law
laying
an
excise
tax
on
distilled
spirits
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
the
revenue
needed
to
pay
the
interest
on
the
funded
debt
it
so
happened
that
a
very
considerable
part
of
the
whisky
manufactured
in
the
country
was
made
by
the
farmers
especially
on
the
frontier
in
their
own
stills
the
new
revenue
law
meant
that
federal
officers
would
now
come
into
the
homes
of
the
people
measure
their
liquor
and
take
the
tax
out
of
their
pockets
all
the
bitterness
which
farmers
felt
against
the
fiscal
measures
of
the
government
was
redoubled
in
the
western
districts
of
pennsylvania
virginia
and
north
carolina
they
refused
to
pay
the
tax
in
pennsylvania
some
of
them
sacked
and
burned
the
houses
of
the
tax
collectors
as
the
revolutionists
thirty
years
before
had
mobbed
the
agents
of
king
george
sent
over
to
sell
stamps
they
were
in
a
fair
way
to
nullify
the
law
in
whole
districts
when
washington
called
out
the
troops
to
suppress
the
whisky
rebellion
then
the
movement
collapsed
but
it
left
behind
a
resentment
which
flared
up
in
the
election
of
several
obdurate
congressmen
from
the
disaffected
regions
foreign
influences
and
domestic
politics
french
in
this
exciting
period
when
all
america
was
distracted
by
partisan
disputes
a
storm
broke
in
europe
the
french
revolution
which
not
only
shook
the
thrones
of
the
old
world
but
stirred
to
its
depths
the
young
republic
of
the
new
world
the
first
scene
in
this
dramatic
affair
occurred
in
the
spring
of
a
few
days
after
washington
was
inaugurated
the
king
of
france
louis
xvi
driven
into
bankruptcy
by
extravagance
and
costly
wars
was
forced
to
resort
to
his
people
for
financial
help
accordingly
he
called
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
one
hundred
fifty
years
a
meeting
of
the
national
parliament
the
estates

composed
of
representatives
of
the
three
estates
the
clergy
nobility
and
commoners
acting
under
powerful
leaders
the
commoners
or
third
estate
swept
aside
the
clergy
and
nobility
and
resolved
themselves
into
a
national
assembly

the
country
to
its
depths

given
to

said
paine

been
mourning
about
the

denied
the

forgetting

the

was
not

whether

drew
back
in
fright

they
heard
of
the
cruel
deeds
committed
during

they
turned
savagely
upon
the

their
friends

as
jacobin
everybody
who
did
not
condemn
loudly
enough
the

assailed

he

by

he
was

and
dined

given
popular
ovations
that
turned

the
whole
country
was
ready
to
join

therefore
attempted
to
use
the
american
ports
as
the
base
of
operations
for
french
privateers
preying
on

and
he
insisted
that

the

proclamation
of
neutrality
and
the
jay
unmoved
by
the
rising
tide
of
popular
sympathy
for
france
washington
took
a
firm
course
he
received
genêt
coldly
the
demand
that
the
united
states
aid
france
under
the
old
treaty
of
alliance
he
answered
by
proclaiming
the
neutrality
of
america
and
warning
american
citizens
against
hostile
acts
toward
either
france
or
england
when
genêt
continued
to
hold
meetings
issue
manifestoes
and
stir
up
the
people
against
england
washington
asked
the
french
government
to
recall
him
this
act
he
followed
up
by
sending
the
chief
justice
john
jay
on
a
pacific
mission
to
england
the
result
was
the
celebrated
jay
treaty
of
by
its
terms
great
britain
agreed
to
withdraw
her
troops
from
the
western
forts
where
they
had
been
since
the
war
for
independence
and
to
grant
certain
slight
trade
concessions
the
chief
sources
of
bitterness
the
failure
of
the
british
to
return
slaves
carried
off
during
the
revolution
the
seizure
of
american
ships
and
the
impressment
of
sailors
were
not
touched
much
to
the
distress
of
everybody
in
america
including
loyal
federalists
nevertheless
washington
dreading
an
armed
conflict
with
england
urged
the
senate
to
ratify
the
treaty
the
weight
of
his
influence
carried
the
day
at
this
the
hostility
of
the
knew
no
bounds
jefferson
declared
the
jay
treaty
an
infamous
act
which
is
really
nothing
more
than
an
alliance
between
england
and
the
of
this
country
against
the
legislature
and
the
people
of
the
united
states
hamilton
defending
it
with
his
usual
courage
was
stoned
by
a
mob
in

york
and
driven
from
the
platform
with
blood
streaming
from
his
face
jay
was
burned
in
effigy
even
washington
was
not
spared
the
house
of
representatives
was
openly
hostile
to
display
its
feelings
it
called
upon
the
president
for
the
papers
relative
to
the
treaty
negotiations
only
to
be
more
highly
incensed
by
his
flat
refusal
to
present
them
on
the
ground
that
the
house
did
not
share
in
the
power
retires
from
such
angry
contests
confirmed
the
president
in
his
slowly
maturing
determination
to
retire
at
the
end
of
his
second
term
in
office
he
did
not
believe
that
a
third
term
was
unconstitutional
or
improper
but
worn
out
by
his
long
and
arduous
labors
in
war
and
in
peace
and
wounded
by
harsh
attacks
from
former
friends
he
longed
for
the
quiet
of
his
beautiful
estate
at
mount
vernon
in
september
on
the
eve
of
the
presidential
election
washington
issued
his
farewell
address
another
state
paper
to
be
treasured
and
read
by
generations
of
americans
to
come
in
this
address
he
directed
the
attention
of
the
people
to
three
subjects
of
lasting
interest
he
warned
them
against
sectional
jealousies
he
remonstrated
against
the
spirit
of
partisanship
saying
that
in
government
of
the
popular
character
in
government
purely
elective
it
is
a
spirit
not
to
be
encouraged
he
likewise
cautioned
the
people
against
the
insidious
wiles
of
foreign
influence
saying
europe
has
a
set
of
primary
interests
which
to
us
have
none
or
a
very
remote
relation
hence
she
must
be
engaged
in
frequent
controversies
the
causes
of
which
are
essentially
foreign
to
our
concerns
hence
therefore
it
would
be
unwise
in
us
to
implicate
ourselves
by
artificial
ties
in
the
ordinary
vicissitudes
of
her
politics
or
the
ordinary
combinations
and
collisions
of
her
friendships
or
enmities
why
forego
the
advantages
of
so
peculiar
a
situation
it
is
our
true
policy
to
steer
clear
of
permanent
alliances
with
any
portion
of
the
foreign
world
taking
care
always
to
keep
ourselves
by
suitable
establishments
on
a
respectable
defensive
posture
we
may
safely
trust
to
temporary
alliances
for
extraordinary
emergencies

of

retirement
of

cast
off

in
honor
of
france
and
in
opposition
to
what
they
were
pleased
to
call
the
monarchical

boldly
assumed
the
name

term

into
general
use
they
selected
jefferson
as
their
candidate
for
president
against
john
adams
the
federalist
nominee
and
carried
on
such
a
spirited
campaign
that
they
came
within
four
votes
of
electing
him
the
successful
candidate
adams
was
not
fitted
by
training
or
opinion
for
conciliating
a
determined
opposition
he
was
a
reserved
and
studious
man
he
was
neither
a
good
speaker
nor
a
skillful
negotiator
in
one
of
his
books
he
had
declared
himself
in
favor
of
government
by
an
aristocracy
of
talents
and
wealth
an
offense
which
the
republicans
never
forgave
while
john
marshall
found
him
a
sensible
plain
candid
man
jefferson
could
see
in
him
nothing
but
a
monocrat
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
conduct
of
the
french
government
adams
would
hardly
have
enjoyed
a

popularity
during
his
administration
quarrel
with
the
french
directory
the
executive
department
established
under
the
constitution
of
managed
however
to
stir
the
anger
of
republicans
and
federalists
alike
it
regarded
the
jay
treaty
as
a
rebuke
to
france
and
a
flagrant
violation
of
obligations
solemnly
registered
in
the
treaty
of
accordingly
it
refused
to
receive
the
american
minister
treated
him
in
a
humiliating
way
and
finally
told
him
to
leave
the
country
overlooking
this
affront
in
his
anxiety
to
maintain
peace
adams
dispatched
to
france
a
commission
of
eminent
men
with
instructions
to
reach
an
understanding
with
the
french
republic
on
their
arrival
they
were
chagrined
to
find
instead
of
a
decent
reception
an
indirect
demand
for
an
apology
respecting
the
past
conduct
of
the
american
government
a
payment
in
cash
and
an
annual
tribute
as
the
price
of
continued
friendship
when
the
news
of
this
affair
reached
president
adams
he
promptly
laid
it
before
congress
referring
to
the
frenchmen
who
had
made
the
demands
as
x
y
and
mr
z
this
insult
coupled
with
the
fact
that
french
privateers
like
the
british
were
preying
upon
american
commerce
enraged
even
the
republicans
who
had
been
loudest
in
the
profession
of
their
french
sympathies
they
forgot
their
wrath
over
the
jay
treaty
and
joined
with
the
federalists
in
shouting
millions
for
defense
not
a
cent
for
tribute
preparations
for
war
were
made
on
every
hand
washington
was
once
more
called
from
mount
vernon
to
take
his
old
position
at
the
head
of
the
army
indeed
fighting
actually
began
upon
the
high
seas
and
went
on
without
a
formal
declaration
of
war
until
the
year
by
that
time
the
directory
had
been
overthrown
a
treaty
was
readily
made
with
napoleon
the
first
consul
who
was
beginning
his
remarkable
career
as
chief
of
the
french
republic
soon
to
be
turned
into
an
empire
and
sedition
flushed
with
success
the
federalists
determined
if
possible
to
put
an
end
to
radical
french
influence
in
america
and
to
silence
republican
opposition
they
therefore
passed
two
drastic
laws
in
the
summer
of
the
alien
and
sedition
acts
the
first
of
these
measures
empowered
the
president
to
expel
from
the
country
or
to
imprison
any
alien
whom
he
regarded
as
dangerous
or
had
reasonable
grounds
to
suspect
of
any
treasonable
or
secret
machinations
against
the
government
the
second
of
the
measures
the
sedition
act
penalized
not
only
those
who
attempted
to
stir
up
unlawful
combinations
against
the
government
but
also
every
one
who
wrote
uttered
or
published
any
false
scandalous
and
malicious
writing
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
either
house
of
congress
or
the
president
of
the
united
states
with
intent
to
defame
said
government
or
to
bring
them
or
either
of
them
into
contempt
or
disrepute
this
measure
was
hurried
through
congress
in
spite
of
the
opposition
and
the
clear
provision
in
the
constitution
that
congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press
even
many
federalists
feared
the
consequences
of
the
action
hamilton
was
alarmed
when
he
read
the
bill
exclaiming
let
us
not
establish
a
tyranny
energy
is
a
very
different
thing
from
violence
john
marshall
told
his
friends
in
virginia
that
had
he
been
in
congress
he
would
have
opposed
the
two
bills
because
he
thought
them
useless
and
calculated
to
create
unnecessary
discontents
and
jealousies
the
alien
law
was
not
enforced
but
it
gave
great
offense
to
the
irish
and
french
whose
activities
against
the
american
government
policy
respecting
great
britain
put
them
in
danger
of
prison
the
sedition
law
on
the
other
hand
was
vigorously
applied
several
editors
of
republican
newspapers
soon
found
themselves
in
jail
or
broken
by
ruinous
fines
for
their
caustic
criticisms
of
the
federalist
president
and
his
policies
bystanders
at
political
meetings
who
uttered
sentiments
which
though
ungenerous
and
severe
seem
harmless
enough
now
were
hurried
before
federalist
judges
and
promptly
fined
and
imprisoned
although
the
prosecutions
were
not
numerous
they
aroused
a
keen
resentment
the
republicans
were
convinced
that
their
political
opponents
having
saddled
upon
the
country
hamilton
fiscal
system
and
the
british
treaty
were
bent
on
silencing
all
censure
the
measures
therefore
had
exactly
the
opposite
effect
from
that
which
their
authors
intended
instead
of
helping
the
federalist
party
they
made
criticism
of
it
more
bitter
than
ever
kentucky
and
virginia
jefferson
was
quick
to
take
advantage
of
the
discontent
he
drafted
a
set
of
resolutions
declaring
the
sedition
law
null
and
void
as
violating
the
federal
constitution
his
resolutions
were
passed
by
the
kentucky
legislature
late
in
signed
by
the
governor
and
transmitted
to
the
other
states
for
their
consideration
though
receiving
unfavorable
replies
from
a
number
of
northern
states
kentucky
the
following
year
reaffirmed
its
position
and
declared
that
the
nullification
of
all
unconstitutional
acts
of
congress
was
the
rightful
remedy
to
be
used
by
the
states
in
the
redress
of
grievances
it
thus
defied
the
federal
government
and
announced
a
doctrine
hostile
to
nationality
and
fraught
with
terrible
meaning
for
the
future
in
the
neighboring
state
of
virginia
madison
led
a
movement
against
the
alien
and
sedition
laws
he
induced
the
legislature
to
pass
resolutions
condemning
the
acts
as
unconstitutional
and
calling
upon
the
other
states
to
take
proper
means
to
preserve
their
rights
and
the
rights
of
the
people
republican
triumph
in
thus
the
way
was
prepared
for
the
election
of
the
republicans
left
no
stone
unturned
in
their
efforts
to
place
on
the
federalist
candidate
president
adams
all
the
odium
of
the
alien
and
sedition
laws
in
addition
to
responsibility
for
approving
hamilton
measures
and
policies
the
federalists
divided
in
councils
and
cold
in
their
affection
for

by

when

a
quarrel
between
a
federalist
and
a
republican
in
the
house
of
representatives
jefferson
election
however
was
still
uncertain
by
a
curious
provision
in
the
constitution
presidential
electors
were
required
to
vote
for
two
persons
without
indicating
which
office
each
was
to
fill
the
one
receiving
the
highest
number
of
votes
to
be
president
and
the
candidate
standing
next
to
be
vice
president
it
so
happened
that
aaron
burr
the
republican
candidate
for
vice
president
had
received
the
same
number
of
votes
as
jefferson
as
neither
had
a
majority
the
election
was
thrown
into
the
house
of
representatives
where
the
federalists
held
the
balance
of
power
although
it
was
well
known
that
burr
was
not
even
a
candidate
for
president
his
friends

federalists
began
intriguing
for
his

to
that
high

had
it

republican

to

cherishing
especially

as
jefferson
said
the
republicans
were
in
the
beginning
provincial
in
their
concern
and
outlook
their
attachment
to
america
was
certainly
as
strong
as
that
of
hamilton
but
they
regarded
the
state
rather
than
the
national
government
as
the
proper
center
of
power
and
affection
indeed
a
large
part
of
the
rank
and
file
had
been
among
the
opponents
of
the
constitution
in
the
days
of
its
adoption
jefferson
had
entertained
doubts
about
it
and
monroe
destined
to
be
the
fifth
president
had
been
one
of
the
bitter
foes
of
ratification
the
former
went
so
far
in
the
direction
of
local
autonomy
that
he
exalted
the
state
above
the
nation
in
the
kentucky
resolutions
of
declaring
the
constitution
to
be
a
mere
compact
and
the
states
competent
to
interpret
and
nullify
federal
law
this
was
provincialism
with
a
vengeance
it
is
jealousy
not
confidence
which
prescribes
limited
constitutions
wrote
jefferson
for
the
kentucky
legislature
jealousy
of
the
national
government
not
confidence
in
it
this
is
the
ideal
that
reflected
the
provincial
and
agricultural
interest
every
act
of
the
jeffersonian
party
during
its
early
days
of
power
was
in
accord
with
the
ideals
of
government
which
it
professed
it
had
opposed
all
pomp
and
ceremony
calculated
to
give
weight
and
dignity
to
the
chief
executive
of
the
nation
as
symbols
of
monarchy
and
high
prerogative
appropriately
therefore
inauguration
on
march
the
first
at
the
new
capital
at
washington
was
marked
by
extreme
simplicity
in
keeping
with
this
procedure
he
quit
the
practice
followed
by
washington
and
adams
of
reading
presidential
addresses
to
congress
in
joint
assembly
and
adopted
in
its
stead
the
plan
of
sending
his
messages
in
writing
a
custom
that
was
continued
unbroken
until
when
president
wilson
returned
to
the
example
set
by
the
first
chief
magistrate
the
republicans
had
complained
of
a
great
national
debt
as
the
source
of
a
dangerous
money
power
giving
strength
to
the
federal
government
accordingly
they
began
to
pay
it
off
as
rapidly
as
possible
they
had
held
commerce
in
low
esteem
and
looked
upon
a
large
navy
as
a
mere
device
to
protect
it
consequently
they
reduced
the
number
of
warships
they
had
objected
to
excise
taxes
particularly
on
whisky
these
they
quickly
abolished
to
the
intense
satisfaction
of
the
farmers
they
had
protested
against
the
heavy
cost
of
the
federal
government
they
reduced
expenses
by
discharging
hundreds
of
men
from
the
army
and
abolishing
many
offices
they
had
savagely
criticized
the
sedition
law
and
jefferson
refused
to
enforce
it
they
had
been
deeply
offended
by
the
assault
on
freedom
of
speech
and
press
and
they
promptly
impeached
samuel
chase
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
who
had
been
especially
severe
in
his
attacks
upon
offenders
under
the
sedition
act
their
failure
to
convict
justice
chase
by
a
narrow
margin
was
due
to
no
lack
of
zeal
on
their
part
but
to
the
federalist
strength
in
the
senate
where
the
trial
was
held
they
had
regarded
the
appointment
of
a
large
number
of
federal
judges
during
the
last
hours
of
adams
administration
as
an
attempt
to
intrench
federalists
in
the
judiciary
and
to
enlarge
the
sphere
of
the
national
government
accordingly
they
at
once
repealed
the
act
creating
the
new
judgeships
thus
depriving
the
midnight
appointees
of
their
posts
they
had
considered
the
federal
offices
civil
and
military
as
sources
of
great
strength
to
the
federalists
and
jefferson
though
committed
to
the
principle
that
offices
should
be
open
to
all
and
distributed
according
to
merit
was
careful
to
fill
most
of
the
vacancies
as
they
occurred
with
trusted
republicans
to
his
credit
however
it
must
be
said
that
he
did
not
make
wholesale
removals
to
find
room
for
party
workers
the
republicans
thus
hewed
to
the
line
of
their
general
policy
of
restricting
the
weight
dignity
and
activity
of
the
national
government
yet
there
were
no
republicans
as
the
federalists
asserted
prepared
to
urge
serious
modifications
in
the
constitution
if
there
be
any
among
us
who
wish
to
dissolve
this
union
or
to
change
its
republican
form
wrote
jefferson
in
his
first
inaugural
let
them
stand
undisturbed
as
monuments
of
the
safety
with
which
error
of
opinion
may
be
tolerated
where
reason
is
left
free
to
combat
it
after
reciting
the
fortunate
circumstances
of
climate
soil
and
isolation
which
made
the
future
of
america
so
full
of
promise
jefferson
concluded
a
wise
and
frugal
government
which
shall
restrain
men
from
injuring
one
another
shall
leave
them
otherwise
free
to
regulate
their
own
pursuits
of
industry
and
improvement
and
shall
not
take
from
the
mouth
of
labour
the
bread
it
has
earned
this
is
the
sum
of
good
government
and
this
is
necessary
to
close
the
circle
of
our
felicities
in
all
this
the
republicans
had
not
reckoned
with
destiny
in
a
few
short
years
that
lay
ahead
it
was
their
fate
to
double
the
territory
of
the
country
making
inevitable
a
continental
nation
to
give
the
constitution
a
generous
interpretation
that
shocked
many
a
federalist
to
wage
war
on
behalf
of
american
commerce
to
reëstablish
the
hated
united
states
bank
to
enact
a
high
protective
tariff
to
see
their
federalist
opponents
in
their
turn
discredited
as
nullifiers
and
provincials
to
announce
high
national
doctrines
in
foreign
affairs
and
to
behold
the
constitution
exalted
and
defended
against
the
pretensions
of
states
by
a
son
of
old
virginia
john
marshall
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
the
republicans
and
the
great
west
and
land
the
first
of
the
great
measures
which
drove
the
republicans
out
upon
this
new
national
course
the
purchase
of
the
louisiana
territory
was
the
product
of
circumstances
rather
than
of
their
deliberate
choosing
it
was
not
the
lack
of
land
for
his
cherished
farmers
that
led
jefferson
to
add
such
an
immense
domain
to
the
original
possessions
of
the
united
states
in
the
northwest
territory
now
embracing
ohio
indiana
illinois
michigan
wisconsin
and
a
portion
of
minnesota
settlements
were
mainly
confined
to
the
north
bank
of
the
ohio
river
to
the
south
in
kentucky
and
tennessee
where
there
were
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
white
people
who
had
pushed
over
the
mountains
from
virginia
and
the
carolinas
there
were
still
wide
reaches
of
untilled
soil
the
alabama
and
mississippi
regions
were
vast
indian
frontiers
of
the
state
of
georgia
unsettled
and
almost
unexplored
even
to
the
wildest
imagination
there
seemed
to
be
territory

to
satisfy
the
land
hunger
of
the
american
people
for
a
century
to
come
significance
of
the
mississippi
at
all
events
the
east
then
the
center
of
power
saw
no
good
reason
for
expansion
the
planters
of
the
carolinas
the
manufacturers
of
pennsylvania
the
importers
of
new
york
the
shipbuilders
of
new
england
looking
to
the
seaboard
and
to
europe
for
trade
refinements
and
sometimes
their
ideas
of
government
were
slow
to
appreciate
the
place
of
the
west
in
national
economy
the
better
educated
the
easterners
were
the
less
it
seems
they
comprehended
the
destiny
of
the
nation
sons
of
federalist
fathers
at
williams
college
after
a
long
debate
decided
by
a
vote
of
fifteen
to
one
that
the
purchase
of
louisiana
was
undesirable
on
the
other
hand
the
pioneers
of
kentucky
ohio
and
tennessee
unlearned
in
books
saw
with
their
own
eyes
the
resources
of
the
wilderness
many
of
them
had
been
across
the
mississippi
and
had
beheld
the
rich
lands
awaiting
the
plow
of
the
white
man
down
the
great
river
they
floated
their
wheat
corn
and
bacon
to
ships
bound
for
the
ports
of
the
seaboard
or
for
europe
the
land
journeys
over
the
mountain
barriers
with
bulky
farm
produce
they
knew
from
experience
were
almost
impossible
and
costly
at
best
nails
bolts
of
cloth
tea
and
coffee
could
go
or
come
that
way
but
not
corn
and
bacon
a
free
outlet
to
the
sea
by
the
mississippi
was
as
essential
to
the
pioneers
of
the
kentucky
region
as
the
harbor
of
boston
to
the
merchant
princes
of
that
metropolis
under
spanish
for
this
reason
they
watched
with
deep
solicitude
the
fortunes
of
the
spanish
king
to
whom
at
the
close
of
the
seven
years
war
had
fallen
the
louisiana
territory
stretching
from
new
orleans
to
the
rocky
mountains
while
he
controlled
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
there
was
little
to
fear
for
he
had
neither
the
army
nor
the
navy
necessary
to
resist
any
invasion
of
american
trade
moreover
washington
had
been
able
by
the
exercise
of
great
tact
to
secure
from
spain
in
a
trading
privilege
through
new
orleans
which
satisfied
the
present
requirements
of
the
frontiersmen
even
if
it
did
not
allay
their
fears
for
the
future
so
things
stood
when
a
swift
succession
of
events
altered
the
whole
situation
transferred
to
in
july
a
royal
order
from
spain
instructed
the
officials
at
new
orleans
to
close
the
port
to
american
produce
about
the
same
time
a
disturbing
rumor
long
current
was
confirmed
napoleon
had
coerced
spain
into
returning
louisiana
to
france
by
a
secret
treaty
signed
in
the
scalers
of
the
alps
and
conquerors
of
venice
now
looked
across
the
sea
for
new
scenes
of
adventure
the
west
was
ablaze
with
excitement
a
call
for
war
ran
through
the
frontier
expeditions
were
organized
to
prevent
the
landing
of
the
french
and
petitions
for
instant
action
flooded
in
upon
jefferson
sees
the
jefferson
the
friend
of
france
and
sworn
enemy
of
england
compelled
to
choose
in
the
interest
of
america
never
winced
the
cession
of
louisiana
and
the
floridas
by
spain
to
france
he
wrote
to
livingston
the
american
minister
in
paris
works
sorely
on
the
united
states
it
completely
reverses
all
the
political
relations
of
the
united
states
and
will
form
a
new
epoch
in
our
political
course
there
is
on
the
globe
one
single
spot
the
possessor
of
which
is
our
natural
and
habitual
enemy
it
is
new
orleans
through
which
the
produce
of
of
our
territory
must
pass
to
market
france
placing
herself
in
that
door
assumes
to
us
an
attitude
of
defiance
spain
might
have
retained
it
quietly
for
years
her
pacific
dispositions
her
feeble
state
would
induce
her
to
increase
our
facilities
there
not
so
can
it
ever
be
in
the
hands
of
france
the
day
that
france
takes
possession
of
new
orleans
fixes
the
sentence
which
is
to
restrain
her
forever
within
her
low
water
mark
it
seals
the
union
of
the
two
nations
who
in
conjunction
can
maintain
exclusive
possession
of
the
ocean
from
that
moment
we
must
marry
ourselves
to
the
british
fleet
and
nation
this
is
not
a
state
of
things
we
seek
or
desire
it
is
one
which
this
measure
if
adopted
by
france
forces
on
us
as
necessarily
as
any
other
cause
by
the
laws
of
nature
brings
on
its
necessary
effect
acting
on
this
belief
but
apparently
seeing
only
the
mississippi
outlet
at
stake
jefferson
sent
his
friend
james
monroe
to
france
with
the
power
to
buy
new
orleans
and
west
florida
before
monroe
arrived
the
regular
minister
livingston
had
already
convinced
napoleon
that
it
would
be
well
to
sell
territory
which
might
be
wrested
from
him
at
any
moment
by
the
british
sea
power
especially
as
the
war
temporarily
stopped
by
the
peace
of
amiens
was
once
more
raging
in
europe
wise
as
he
was
in
his
day
livingston
had
at
first
no
thought
of
buying
the
whole
louisiana
country
he
was
simply
dazed
when
napoleon
offered
to
sell
the
entire
domain
and
get
rid
of
the
business
altogether
though
staggered
by
the
proposal
he
and
monroe
decided
to
accept
on
april
they
signed
the
treaty
of
cession
agreeing
to
pay
in
six
per
cent
bonds
and
to
discharge
certain
debts
due
french
citizens
making
in
all
approximately
fifteen
millions
spain
protested
napoleon
brother
fumed
french
newspapers
objected
but
the
deed
was
done
and
his
constitutional
when
the
news
of
this
extraordinary
event
reached
the
united
states
the
people
were
filled
with
astonishment
and
no
one
was
more
surprised
than
jefferson
himself
he
had
thought
of
buying
new
orleans
and
west
florida
for
a
small
sum
and
now
a
vast
domain
had
been
dumped
into
the
lap
of
the
nation
he
was
puzzled
on
looking
into
the
constitution
he
found
not
a
line
authorizing
the
purchase
of
more
territory
and
so
he
drafted
an
amendment
declaring
louisiana
as
ceded
by
france
a
part
of
the
united
states
he
had
belabored
the
federalists
for
piling
up
a
big
national
debt
and
he
could
hardly
endure
the
thought
of
issuing
more
bonds
himself
in
the
midst
of
his
doubts
came
the
news
that
napoleon
might
withdraw
from
the
bargain
thoroughly
alarmed
by
that
jefferson
pressed
the
senate
for
a
ratification
of
the
treaty
he
still
clung
to
his
original
idea
that
the
constitution
did
not
warrant
the
purchase
but
he
lamely
concluded
if
our
friends
shall
think
differently
i
shall
certainly
acquiesce
with
satisfaction

the

cut
loose
from

intrusted
the
construction
of

to
the

treaty
this
unusual
transaction
so
favorable
to
the

aroused
the

of
the

federalists
some
denounced
it
as
unconstitutional
easily
forgetting

urged

the

was
hauled
down
from

the
original

of
the

was
more
than
doubled
while
the
boundaries
of

were
uncertain
it
is
safe
to

that
the

included
what

seven

dollars
almost
five
hundred
times
the

fateful
step
jefferson
wisely
began
to
make
the
most
of
it

prepared
for
the
opening
of

sending

its
resources
and
lay
out
an
overland
route
through

across

pacific
the
story
of
this
mighty
exploit
which
began
in
the
spring
of

ended
in
the
autumn
of
was
set
down
with
skill
and
pains
in
the
journal
of
lewis
and
clark
when
published
even
in
a
short
form
it
invited
the

to
take

the

napoleon
retaliated
by
his
berlin
decree
of
november
blockading
the
british
isles
a
measure
terrifying
to
american
ship
owners
whose
vessels
were
liable
to
seizure
by
any
french
rover
though
napoleon
had
no
navy
to
make
good
his
proclamation
great
britain
countered
with
a
still
more
irritating
decree
the
orders
in
council
of
it
modified
its
blockade
but
in
so
doing
merely
authorized
american
ships
not
carrying
munitions
of
war
to
complete
their
voyage
to
the
continent
on
condition
of
their
stopping
at
a
british
port
securing
a
license
and
paying
a
tax
this
responded
napoleon
was
the
height
of
insolence
and
he
denounced
it
as
a
gross
violation
of
international
law
he
then
closed
the
circle
of
american
troubles
by
issuing
his
milan
decree
of
december
this
order
declared
that
any
ship
which
complied
with
the
british
rules
would
be
subject
to
seizure
and
confiscation
by
french
authorities
impressment
of
that
was
not
all
great
britain
in
dire
need
of
men
for
her
navy
adopted
the
practice
of
stopping
american
ships
searching
them
and
carrying
away
sailors
found
on
board
british
sailors
were
so
badly
treated
so
cruelly
flogged
for
trivial
causes
and
so
meanly
fed
that
they
fled
in
crowds
to
the
american
marine
in
many
cases
it
was
difficult
to
tell
whether
seamen
were
english
or
american
they
spoke
the
same
language
so
that
language
was
no
test
rovers
on
the
deep
and
stragglers
in
the
ports
of
both
countries
they
frequently
had
no
papers
to
show
their
nativity
moreover
great
britain
held
to
the
old
rule
once
an
englishman
always
an
englishman
a
doctrine
rejected
by
the
united
states
in
favor
of
the
principle
that
a
man
could
choose
the
nation
to
which
he
would
give
allegiance
british
sea
captains
sometimes
by
mistake
and
often
enough
with
reckless
indifference
carried
away
into
servitude
in
their
own
navy
genuine
american
citizens
the
process
itself
even
when
executed
with
all
the
civilities
of
law
was
painful
enough
for
it
meant
that
american
ships
were
forced
to
come
to
and
compelled
to
rest
submissively
under
british
guns
until
the
searching
party
had
pried
into
records
questioned
seamen
seized
and
handcuffed
victims
saints
could
not
have
done
this
work
without
raising
angry
passions
and
only
saints
could
have
endured
it
with
patience
and
fortitude
had
the
enactment
of
the
scenes
been
confined
to
the
high
seas
and
knowledge
of
them
to
rumors
and
newspaper
stories
american
resentment
might
not
have
been
so
intense
but
many
a
search
and
seizure
was
made
in
sight
of
land
british
and
french
vessels
patrolled
the
coasts
firing
on
one
another
and
chasing
one

an
act
which
even
the
british
ministry
could
hardly
excuse
if
the
french
were
less
frequently
the
offenders
it
was
not
because
of
their
tenderness
about
american
rights
but
because
so

escaped

navy
to
operate
in
american
waters

this
conduct
on
the
part
of
european
belligerents
was
very
injurious
to
american
trade
by
their
enterprise
american
shippers
had
become
the
foremost
carriers
on
the
atlantic
ocean
in
a
decade
they
had
doubled
the
tonnage
of
american
merchant
ships
under
the
american
flag
taking
the
place
of
the
french
marine
when
britain
swept
that
from

with
the
sinews
of

for
the
contest
with

napoleonic
empire
the

almost
tons
in
such

the
enterprise
attacked
by
the
british

french
decrees
american
ships
bound
for

britain
were
liable
to
be
captured
by
french
privateers
which
in
spite
of
the
disasters
of

nile
and

ranged
the

american
ships
destined
for
the
continent
if
they
failed
to
stop
at
british
ports
and
pay
tribute
were
in
great
danger
of
capture
by
the
sleepless
british
navy
and
its
swarm
of
auxiliaries
american
sea
captains
who
in
fear
of
british
vengeance
heeded
the
orders
in

and
paid
the
tax

almost
certain
to
fall
a
prey

vigorous
in
executing
the

the

dilemma
was
distressing
both
the
belligerents
in

were
guilty
of
depredations
on
american
commerce
war
on
both
of
them
was
out
of
the
question
war
on
france
was
impossible
because
she
had
no
territory
on
this
side
of
the
water
which
could
be

a
power
which
jefferson

feared

he
was
startled
at
the
death

which
it
brought
in
its
train
so
for
the
eight
years
jefferson
steered
an
even
course

measure
after

with
a
view
to
avoiding

he
sent

he
evaded

every

expedient
to
protect

rights
embargo
and
in
congress
passed
and
jefferson
approved
a
act
closing
american
ports
to
certain
products
from
british
dominions
a
measure
intended
as
a
club
over
the
british
government
head
this
law
failing
in
its
purpose
jefferson
proposed
and
congress
adopted
in
december
the
embargo
act
forbidding
all
vessels
to
leave
american
harbors
for
foreign
ports
france
and
england
were
to
be
brought
to
terms
by
cutting
off
their
supplies
the
result
of
the
embargo
was
pathetic
england
and
france
refused
to
give
up
search
and
seizure
american
ship
owners
who
lured
by
huge
profits
had
formerly
been
willing
to
take
the
risk
were
now
restrained
by
law
to
their
home
ports
every
section
suffered
the
south
and
west
found
their
markets
for
cotton

they
learned
by
bitter
experience

national
significance
of

longshoremen
and

were
thrown
out
of
employment
while
the
prices
of
foreign

doubled
those
who
obeyed
the
law
were
ruined
violators
of
the
law
smuggled
goods
into
canada
and
florida
for

abroad
jefferson
friends
accepted
the
medicine
with
a
wry
face
as
the
only
alternative
to
supine
submission
or
open
war
his
opponents
without
offering
any
solution
of
their
own
denounced
it
as
a
contemptible
plan
that
brought
neither
relief
nor
honor
beset
by
the
clamor
that
arose
on
all
sides
congress
in
the
closing
days
of
jefferson
administration
repealed
the
embargo
law
and
substituted
a
act
forbidding
trade
with
england
and
france
while
permitting
it
with

countries

measure
equally
futile

of
jefferson
exhausted
by
endless
wrangling
and
wounded
as
washington
had
been
by
savage
criticism
welcomed
march
his
friends
urged
him
to
stay
by
the
ship
and
accept
a
third
term
he
declined
saying
that
election
for
life
might
result
from
repeated
reëlection
in
following
course
and
defending
it
on
principle
he
set
an
example
to
all
his
successors
making
the
third
term
doctrine
a
part
of
american
unwritten
law
his
intimate
friend
james
madison
to
whom
he
turned
over
the
burdens
of
his
high
office
was
like
himself
a
man
of
peace
madison
had
been
a
leader
since
the
days
of
the
revolution
but
in
legislative
halls
and
council
chambers
not
on
the
field
of
battle
small
in
stature
sensitive
in
feelings
studious
in
habits
he
was
no
man
for
the
rough
and
tumble
of
practical
politics
he
had
taken
a
prominent
and
distinguished
part
in
the
framing
and
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
he
had
served
in
the
first
congress
as
a
friend
of
hamilton
measures
later
he
attached
himself
to
jefferson
fortunes
and
served
for
eight
years
as
his
first
counselor
the
secretary
of
state
the
principles
of
the
constitution
which
he
had
helped
to
make
and
interpret
he
was
now
as
president
called
upon
to
apply
in
one
of
the
most
perplexing
moments
in
all
american
history
in
keeping
with
his
own
traditions
and
following
in
the
footsteps
of
jefferson
he
vainly
tried
to
solve
the
foreign
problem
by
negotiation
trend
of
whatever
difficulties
madison
had
in
making
up
his
mind
on
war
and
peace
were
settled
by
events
beyond
his
own
control
in
the
spring
of
a
british
frigate
held
up
an
american
ship
near
the
harbor
of
new
york
and
impressed
a
seaman
alleged
to
be
an
american
citizen
burning
with
resentment
the
captain
of
the
an
american
warship
acting
under
orders
poured
several
broadsides
into
the
a
british
sloop
suspected
of
being
the
guilty
party
the
british
also
encouraged
the
indian
chief
tecumseh
who
welded
together
the
indians
of
the
northwest
under
british
protection
and
gave
signs
of
restlessness
presaging
a
revolt
this
sent
a
note
of
alarm
along
the
frontier
that
was
not
checked
even
when
in
november
tecumseh
men
were
badly
beaten
at
tippecanoe
by
william
henry
harrison
the
indians
stood
in
the
way
of
the
advancing
frontier
and
it
seemed
to
the
pioneers
that
without
support
from
the
british
in
canada
the
red
men
would
soon
be
subdued
and
while
events
were
moving
swiftly
and
rumors
were
flying
thick
and
fast
the
mastery
of
the
government
passed
from
the
uncertain
hands
of
madison
to
a
party
of
ardent
young
men
in
congress
dubbed
young
republicans
under
the
leadership
of
two
members
destined
to
be
mighty
figures
in
american
history
henry
clay
of
kentucky
and
john
calhoun
of
south
carolina
the
former
contended
in
a
flair
of
folly
that
the
militia
of
kentucky
alone
are
competent
to
place
montreal
and
upper
canada
at
your
feet
the
latter
with
a
light
heart
spoke
of
conquering
canada
in
a
four
weeks
campaign
it
must
not
be
inferred
says
channing
that
in
advocating
conquest
the
westerners
were
actuated
merely
by
desire
for
land
they
welcomed
war
because
they
thought
it
would
be
the
easiest
way
to
abate
indian
troubles
the
savages
were
supported
by
the
interests
that
centred
at
quebec
and
london
the
southerners
on
their
part
wished
for
florida
and
they
thought
that
the
conquest
of
canada
would
obviate
some
northern
opposition
to
this
acquisition
of
slave
territory
while
clay
and
calhoun
spokesmen
of
the
west
and
south
were
not
unmindful
of
what
napoleon
had
done
to
american
commerce
they
knew
that
their
followers
still
remembered
with
deep
gratitude
the
aid
of
the
french
in
the
war
for
independence
and
that
the
embers
of
the
old
hatred
for
george
iii
still
on
the
throne
could
be
readily
blown
into
flame
accepts
war
as
the
conduct
of
the
british
ministers
with
whom
madison
had
to
deal
did
little
to
encourage
him
in
adhering
to
the
policy
of
watchful
waiting
one
of
them
a
high
tory
believed
that
all
americans
were
alike
except
that
a
few
are
less
knaves
than
others
and
his
methods
were
colored
by
his
belief
on
the
recall
of
this
minister
the
british
government
selected
another
no
less
high
and
mighty
in
his
principles
and
opinions
so
madison
became
thoroughly
discouraged
about
the
outcome
of
pacific
measures
when
the
pressure
from
congress
upon
him
became
too
heavy
he
gave
way
signing
on
june
the
declaration
of
war
on
great
britain
in
proclaiming
hostilities
the
administration
set
forth
the
causes
which
justified
the
declaration
namely
the
british
had
been
encouraging
the
indians
to
attack
american
citizens
on
the
frontier
they
had
ruined
american
trade
by
blockades
they
had
insulted
the
american
flag
by
stopping
and
searching
our
ships
they
had
illegally
seized
american
sailors
and
driven
them
into
the
british
navy
course
of
the
the
war
lasted
for
nearly
three
years
without
bringing
victory
to
either
side
the
surrender
of
detroit
by
general
hull
to
the
british
and
the
failure
of
the
american
invasion
of
canada
were
offset
by
perry
victory
on
lake
erie
and
a
decisive
blow
administered
to
british
designs
for
an
invasion
of
new
york
by
way
of
plattsburgh
the
triumph
of
jackson
at
new
orleans
helped
to
atone
for
the
humiliation
suffered
in
the
burning
of
the
capitol
by
the
british
the
stirring
deeds
of
the
the
and
the
on
the
seas
the
heroic
death
of
lawrence

the
victories
of
a
hundred

consolation
for
those
who
suffered
from
the
iron
blockade
finally
established
by
the
british
government
when
it
came
to
appreciate
the
gravity
of
the
situation
while
men
love
the
annals
of
the
sea
they
will
turn
to
the
running
battles
the
narrow
escapes
and
the
reckless
daring
of
american
sailors
in
that
naval
contest
with
great
britain
all
this
was
exciting
but
it
was
inconclusive
in

never
was
a
government
less
prepared
than
was
that

neither

were

nothing
about
the

of
american

the
destruction

the
searching
of

the

nevertheless
we
are
told
the
people
passed
from
gloom
to
glory
when
the
news
of

arrived
the
bells
were
rung
schools
were
closed

were
displayed

a
rousing

was
drunk

meant
the
completion
of
the

already

in
the
course
of

the

came
perilously
near
to
treason
in
their
efforts
to
hamper
the
government
of
the
united

and
in
their
desperation
they
fell
back
upon
the

the

solemnly
went
on
record
to
the
effect
that
acts
of
congress
in
violation
of
the

are
void
that
in
cases

deliberate
dangerous
and
palpable
infractions
the

is
duty
bound

interpose

calhoun
refused

men
away
from
mere
allegiance

first
of
these
was
the

the
acquisition
of

the

on

occasion

indian
outbreak
ordered

jackson
to
seize

offenders
in
the
floridas

necessary
the
warrior
taking
this
as
a
hint
that
he
was
to

the
coveted
region
replied
that
if
possession
was
the
object
of
the
invasion
he
could
occupy
the
floridas
within
sixty
days
without
waiting
for
an
answer
to
this
letter
he
launched
his
expedition
and
in
the
spring
of
was
master
of
the
spanish
king
domain
to
the
south
there
was
nothing
for
the
king
to
do
but
to
make
the
best
of
the
inevitable
by
ceding
the
floridas
to
the
united
states
in
return
for
five
million
dollars
to
be
paid
to
american
citizens
having
claims
against
spain
on
washington
birthday
the
treaty
was
signed
it
ceded
the
floridas
to
the
united
states
and
defined
the
boundary
between
mexico
and
the
united
states
by
drawing
a
line
from
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
river
in
a
northwesterly
direction
to
the
pacific
on
this
occasion
even
monroe
former
opponent
of
the
constitution
forgot
to
inquire
whether
new
territory
could
be
constitutionally
acquired
and
incorporated
into
the
american
union
the
republicans
seemed
far
away
from
the
days
of
strict
construction
and
jefferson
still
lived
monroe
even
more
effective
in
fashioning
the
national
idea
was
monroe
enunciation
of
the
famous
doctrine
that
bears
his
name
the
occasion
was
another
european
crisis
during
the
napoleonic
upheaval
and
the
years
of
dissolution
that
ensued
the
spanish
colonies
in

following
the
example
set

case

three
of
them
austria
prussia
and
russia
under
the
leadership
of
the
czar
alexander
i
in
the
autumn
of
had
entered
into
a
holy
alliance
to
sustain
by
reciprocal
service
the
autocratic
principle
in
government
although
the
effusive
almost
maudlin
language
of
the
treaty
did
not
express
their
purpose
explicitly
the
alliance
was
later
regarded
as
a
mere
union
of
monarchs
to
prevent
the
rise
and
growth
of
popular
government
the
american
people
thought
their
worst
fears
confirmed
when
in
a
conference
of
delegates
from
russia
austria
prussia
and
france
met
at
verona
to
consider
among
other
things
revolutions
that
had
just
broken
out
in
spain
and
italy
the
spirit
of
the
conference
is
reflected
in
the
first
article
of
the
agreement
reached
by
the
delegates
the
high
contracting
powers
being
convinced
that
the
system
of
representative
government
is
equally
incompatible
with
the
monarchical
principle
and
the
maxim
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
with
the
divine
right
mutually
engage
in
the
most
solemn
manner
to
use
all
their
efforts
to
put
an
end
to
the
system
of
representative
government
in
whatever
country
it
may
exist
in
europe
and
to
prevent
its
being
introduced
in
those
countries
where
it
is
not
yet
known
the
czar
who
incidentally
coveted
the
west
coast
of
north
america
proposed
to
send
an
army
to
aid
the
king
of
spain
in
his
troubles
at
home
thus
preparing
the
way
for
intervention
in
spanish
america
it
was
material
weakness
not
want
of
spirit
that
prevented
the
grand
union
of
monarchs
from
making
open
war
on
popular
government
position
of
unfortunately
too
for
the
holy
alliance
england
refused
to
coöperate
english
merchants
had
built
up
a
large
trade
with
the
independent
colonies
and
they
protested
against
the
restoration
of
spanish
sovereignty
which
meant
a
renewal
of
spain
former
trade
monopoly
moreover
divine
right
doctrines
had
been
laid
to
rest
in
england
and
the
representative
principle
thoroughly
established
already
there
were
signs
of
the
coming
democratic
flood
which
was
soon
to
carry
the
first
reform
bill
of
extending
the
suffrage
and
sweep
on
to
even
greater
achievements
british
statesmen
therefore
had
to
be
cautious
in
such
circumstances
instead
of
coöperating
with
the
autocrats
of
russia
austria
and
prussia
they
turned
to
the
minister
of
the
united
states
in
london
the
british
prime
minister
canning
proposed
that
the
two
countries
join
in
declaring
their
unwillingness
to
see
the
spanish
colonies
transferred
to
any
other
power
the
proposal
was
rejected
but
president
monroe
took
up
the
suggestion
with
madison
and
jefferson
as
well
as
with
his
secretary
of
state
john
quincy
adams
they
favored
the
plan
jefferson
said
one
nation
most
of
all
could
disturb
us
in
this
pursuit
of
freedom
she
now
offers
to
lead
aid
and
accompany
us
in
it
by
acceding
to
her
proposition
we
detach
her
from
the
bands
bring
her
mighty
weight
into
the
scale
of
free
government
and
emancipate
a
continent
at
one
stroke
with
her
on
our
side
we
need
not
fear
the
whole
world
with
her
then
we
should
most
sedulously
cherish
a
cordial
friendship
statement
of
the
acting
on
the
advice
of
trusted
friends
president
monroe
embodied
in
his
message
to
congress
on
december
a
statement
of
principles
now
famous
throughout
the
world
as
the
monroe
doctrine
to
the
autocrats
of
europe
he
announced
that
he
would
regard
any
attempt
on
their
part
to
extend
their
system
to
any
portion
of
this
hemisphere
as
dangerous
to
our
peace
and
safety
while
he
did
not
propose
to
interfere
with
existing
colonies
dependent
on
european
powers
he
ranged
himself
squarely
on
the
side
of
those
that
had
declared
their
independence
any
attempt
by
a
european
power
to
oppress
them
or
control
their
destiny
in
any
manner
he
characterized
as
a
manifestation
of
an
unfriendly
disposition
toward
the
united
states
referring
in
another
part
of
his
message
to
a
recent
claim
which
the
czar
had
made
to
the
pacific
coast
president
monroe
warned
the
old
world
that
the
american
continents
by
the
free
and
independent
condition
which
they
have
assumed
and
maintained
are
henceforth
not
to
be
considered
as
subjects
for
future
colonization
by
any
european
powers
the
effect
of
this
declaration
was
immediate
and
profound
men
whose
political
horizon
had
been
limited
to
a
community
or
state
were
led
to
consider
their
nation
as
a
great
power
among
the
sovereignties
of
the
earth
taking
its
part
in
shaping
their
international
relations
missouri
respecting
one
other
important
measure
of
this
period
the
republicans
also
took
a
broad
view
of
their
obligations
under
the
constitution
namely
the
missouri
compromise
it
is
true
they
insisted
on
the
admission
of
missouri
as
a
slave
state
balanced
against
the
free
state
of
maine
but
at
the
same
time
they
assented
to
the
prohibition
of
slavery
in
the
louisiana
territory
north
of
the
line
during
the
debate
on
the
subject
an
extreme
view
had
been
presented
to
the
effect
that
congress
had
no
constitutional
warrant
for
abolishing
slavery
in
the
territories
the
precedent
of
the
northwest
ordinance
ratified
by
congress
in
seemed
a
conclusive
answer
from
practice
to
this
contention
but
monroe
submitted
the
issue
to
his
cabinet
which
included
calhoun
of
south
carolina
crawford
of
georgia
and
wirt
of
virginia
all
presumably
adherents
to
the
jeffersonian
principle
of
strict
construction
he
received
in
reply
a
unanimous
verdict
to
the
effect
that
congress
did
have
the
power
to
prohibit
slavery
in
the
territories
governed
by
it
acting
on
this
advice
he
approved
on
march
the
bill
establishing
freedom
north
of
the
compromise
line
this
generous
interpretation
of
the
powers
of
congress
stood
for
nearly
forty
years
until
repudiated
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
dred

national
decisions
of
chief
justice

no

views
have
ever
led

deny

all
will
likewise
agree

education
inured
to
hardship
and
rough
life
he
rose
by
masterly
efforts
to
the
highest
judicial
honor
america
can
bestow
on
him
the
bitter
experience
of
the
revolution
and
of
later
days
made
a
lasting
impression
he
was
no
summer
patriot
he
had
been
a
soldier
in
the
revolutionary
army
he
had
suffered
with
washington
at
valley
forge
he
had
seen
his
comrades
in
arms
starving
and
freezing
because
the
continental
congress
had
neither
the
power
nor
the
inclination
to
force
the
states
to
do
their
full
duty
to
him
the
articles
of
confederation
were
the
symbol
of
futility
into
the
struggle
for
the
formation
of
the
constitution
and
its
ratification
in
virginia
he
had
thrown
himself
with
the
ardor
of
a
soldier
later
as
a
member
of
congress
a
representative
to
france
and
secretary
of
state
he
had
aided
the
federalists
in
establishing
the
new
government
when
at
length
they
were
driven
from
power
in
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
of
the
government
he
was
chosen
for
their
last
stronghold
the
supreme
court
by
historic
irony
he
administered
the
oath
of
office
to
his
bitterest
enemy
thomas
jefferson
and
long
after
the
author
of
the
declaration
of
independence
had
retired
to
private
life
the
stern
chief
justice
continued
to
announce
the
old
federalist
principles
from
the
supreme
bench
illustration
john
marshall
madison
an
act
of
congress
he
had
been
in
his
high
office
only
two
years
when
he
laid
down
for
the
first
time
in
the
name
of
the
entire
court
the
doctrine
that
the
judges
have
the
power
to
declare
an
act
of
congress
null
and
void
when
in
their
opinion
it
violates
the
constitution
this
power
was
not
expressly
conferred
on
the
court
though
many
able
men
held
that
the
judicial
branch
of
the
government
enjoyed
it
the
principle
was
not
positively
established
until
when
the
case
of
marbury
madison
was
decided
in
rendering
the
opinion
of
the
court
marshall
cited
no
precedents
he
sought
no
foundations
for
his
argument
in
ancient
history
he
rested
it
on
the
general
nature
of
the
american
system
the
constitution
ran
his
reasoning
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
it
limits
and
binds
all
who
act
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
it
limits
the
powers
of
congress
and
defines
the
rights
of
citizens
if
congress
can
ignore
its
limitations
and
trespass
upon
the
rights
of
citizens
marshall
argued
then
the
constitution
disappears
and
congress
is
supreme
since
however
the
constitution
is
supreme
and
superior
to
congress
it
is
the
duty
of
judges
under
their
oath
of
office
to
sustain
it
against
measures
which
violate
it
therefore
from
the
nature
of
the
american
constitutional
system
the
courts
must
declare
null
and
void
all
acts
which
are
not
authorized
a
law
repugnant
to
the
constitution
he
closed
is
void
and
the
courts
as
well
as
other
departments
are
bound
by
that
instrument
from
that
day
to
this
the
practice
of
federal
and
state
courts
in
passing
upon
the
constitutionality
of
laws
has
remained
unshaken
this
doctrine
was
received
by
jefferson
and
many
of
his
followers
with
consternation
if
the
idea
was
sound
he
exclaimed
then
indeed
is
our
constitution
a
complete
de
legally
a
suicide
for
intending
to
establish
three
departments
coördinate
and
independent
that
they
might
check
and
balance
one
another
it
has
given
according
to
this
opinion
to
one
of
them
alone
the
right
to
prescribe
rules
for
the
government
of
the
others
and
to
that
one
too
which
is
unelected
by
and
independent
of
the
nation
the
constitution
on
this
hypothesis
is
a
mere
thing
of
wax
in
the
hands
of
the
judiciary
which
they
may
twist
and
shape
into
any
form
they
please
it
should
be
remembered
as
an
axiom
of
eternal
truth
in
politics
that
whatever
power
in
any
government
is
independent
is
absolute
also
a
judiciary
independent
of
a
king
or
executive
alone
is
a
good
thing
but
independence
of
the
will
of
the
nation
is
a
solecism
at
least
in
a
republican
government
but
marshall
was
mighty
and
his
view
prevailed
though
from
time
to
time
other
men
clinging
to
jefferson
opinion
likewise
opposed
the
exercise
by
the
courts
of
the
high
power
of
passing
upon
the
constitutionality
of
acts
of
congress
of
state
legislatures
declared
had
marshall
stopped
with
annulling
an
act
of
congress
he
would
have
heard
less
criticism
from
republican
quarters
but
with
the
same
firmness
he
set
aside
acts
of
state
legislatures
as
well
whenever
in
his
opinion
they
violated
the
federal
constitution
in
in
the
case
of
fletcher
peck
he
annulled
an
act
of
the
georgia
legislature
informing
the
state
that
it
was
not
sovereign
but
a
part
of
a
large
empire
a
member
of
the
american
union
and
that
union
has
a
constitution
which
imposes
limits
to
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
in
the
case
of
mcculloch
maryland
decided
in
he
declared
void
an
act
of
the
maryland
legislature
designed
to
paralyze
the
branches
of
the
united
states
bank
established
in
that
state
in
the
same
year
in
the
still
more
memorable
dartmouth
college
case
he
annulled
an
act
of
the
new
hampshire
legislature
which
infringed
upon
the
charter
received
by
the
college
from
king
george
long
before
that
charter
he
declared
was
a
contract
between
the
state
and
the
college
which
the
legislature
under
the
federal
constitution
could
not
impair
two
years
later
he
stirred
the
wrath
of
virginia
by
summoning
her
to
the
bar
of
the
supreme
court
to
answer
in
a
case
in
which
the
validity
of
one
of
her
laws
was
involved
and
then
justified
his
action
in
a
powerful
opinion
rendered
in
the
case
of
cohens
virginia
all
these
decisions
aroused
the
legislatures
of
the
states
they
passed
sheaves
of
resolutions
protesting
and
condemning
but
marshall
never
turned
and
never
stayed
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
he
fairly
thundered
at
them
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
the
supreme
court
is
the
proper
tribunal
to
pass
finally
upon
the
validity
of
the
laws
of
the
states
and
those
sovereignties
far
from
possessing
the
right
of
review
and
nullification
are
irrevocably
bound
by
the
decisions
of
that
court
this
was
strong
medicine
for
the
authors
of
the
kentucky
and
virginia
resolutions
and
for
the
members
of
the
hartford
convention
but
they
had
to
take
it
doctrine
of
implied
while
restraining
congress
in
the
marbury
case
and
the
state
legislatures
in
a
score
of
cases
marshall
also
laid
the
judicial
foundation
for
a
broad
and
liberal
view
of
the
constitution
as
opposed
to
narrow
and
strict
construction
in
mcculloch
maryland
he
construed
generously
the
words
necessary
and
proper
in
such
a
way
as
to
confer
upon
congress
a
wide
range
of
implied
powers
in
addition
to
their
express
powers
that
case
involved
among
other
things
the
question
whether
the
act
establishing
the
second
united
states
bank
was
authorized
by
the
constitution
marshall
answered
in
the
affirmative
congress
ran
his
reasoning
has
large
powers
over
taxation
and
the
currency
a
bank
is
of
appropriate
use
in
the
exercise
of
these
enumerated
powers
and
therefore
though
not
absolutely
necessary
a
bank
is
entirely
proper
and
constitutional
with
respect
to
the
means
by
which
the
powers
that
the
constitution
confers
are
to
be
carried
into
execution
he
said
congress
must
be
allowed
the
discretion
which
will
enable
that
body
to
perform
the
high
duties
assigned
to
it
in
the
manner
most
beneficial
to
the
people
in
short
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
not
a
strait
jacket
but
a
flexible
instrument
vesting
in
congress
the
powers
necessary
to
meet
national
problems
as
they
arise
in
delivering
this
opinion
marshall
used
language
almost
identical
with
that
employed
by
lincoln
when
standing
on
the
battle
field
of
a
war
waged
to
preserve
the
nation
he
said
that
a
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
shall
not
perish

during
the
strenuous
period
between
the
establishment

american

and
the
advent

democracy
the
great
american
experiment
was
under
the
direction
of
the
men
who
had
launched
it
all
the
presidents
in
that
period
except
john
quincy
adams
had
taken

james
madison
the
chief
author
of
the
constitution
lived
until
this
age
therefore
was
the
age
of
the
fathers
it
saw
the
threatened
ruin
of
the
country
under
the
articles
of

the
formation
of
the

the
rise
of
political
parties

the
apparent
triumph
of
the
national
spirit
over
sectionalism
the
new
republic
had
hardly
been
started
in
before
its
troubles
began
the
government
could
not
raise
money
to
pay
its
debts
or
running
expenses
it
could
not
protect
american
commerce
and
manufactures
against
european
competition
it
could
not
stop
the
continual
issues
of
paper
money
by
the
states
it
could
not
intervene
to
put
down
domestic
uprisings
that
threatened
the
existence
of
the
state
governments
without
money
without
an
army
without

the

under
the
articles
of

was
drifting
into
dissolution
patriots
who
had
risked
their
lives
for
independence
began
to
talk
of
monarchy
again
washington
hamilton
and
madison
insisted
that
a
new
constitution
alone
could
save
america
from
disaster
by
dint
of
much
labor
the
friends
of
a
new
form
of
government
induced
the
congress
to
call
a
national
convention
to
take
into
account
the
state
of
america
in
may
it
assembled
at
philadelphia
and
for
months
it
debated
and
wrangled
over
plans
for
a
constitution
the
small
states
clamored
for
equal
rights
in
the
union
the
large
states
vowed
that
they
would
never
grant
it
a
spirit
of
conciliation
fair
play
and
compromise
saved
the
convention
from
breaking
up
in
addition
there
were
jealousies
between
the
planting
states
and
the
commercial
states
here
too
compromises
had
to
be
worked
out
some
of
the
delegates
feared
the
growth
of
democracy
and
others
cherished
it
these
factions
also
had
to
be
placated
at
last
a
plan
of
government
was
drafted
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
submitted
to
the
states
for
approval
only
after
a
long
and
acrimonious
debate
did
enough
states
ratify
the
instrument
to
put
it
into

hamilton
led
the
way
but
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
encountered
opposition
he
found
a
formidable
antagonist
in
jefferson
in
time
two
political
parties
appeared
full
armed
upon
the
scene
the
federalists
and
the
republicans
for
ten

they
filled
the

debate
in
the
federalists
were
utterly
vanquished
by
the
republicans
with
jefferson
in
the
lead
by
their
proclamations
of
faith
the
republicans
favored
the
states
rather
than
the
new

government
but
in
practice
they
added
immensely
to
the
prestige
and
power
of
the

they
purchased

they
waged
a

was
in

to

the

of
the

was
heard
when

of

advocated
his

when
jackson

condemned
nullification
in

that
has
taken
its

when

called
upon
a

people
to
meet
the
supreme
test
whether

the

precipitating
the
war
for
independence
americans
on
the
frontier
did
not
forget
it
when
indians
were
employed
by
england
to
defend
that
land
zeal
for
the
patriot
cause
set
the
interior
aflame
it
was
the
members
of
the
western
vanguard
like
daniel
boone
john
sevier
and
george
rogers
clark
who
first
understood
the
value
of
the
country
under
the
guns
of
the
english
forts
where
the
red
men
still
wielded
the
tomahawk
and
the
scalping
knife
it
was
they
who
gave
the
east
no
rest
until
their
vision
was
seen
by
the
leaders
on
the
seaboard
who
directed
the
course
of
national
policy
it
was
one
of
their
number
a
seasoned
indian
fighter
george
rogers
clark
who
with
aid
from
virginia
seized
kaskaskia
and
vincennes
and
secured
the
whole
northwest
to
the
union
while
the
fate
of
washington
army
was
still
hanging
in
the
balance
problems
at
the
end
of
the
the
treaty
of
peace
signed
with
great
britain
in
brought
the
definite
cession
of
the
coveted
territory
west
to
the
mississippi
river
but
it
left
unsolved
many
problems
in
the
first
place
tribes
of
resentful
indians
in
the
ohio
region
even
though
british
support
was
withdrawn
at
last
had
to
be
reckoned
with
and
it
was
not
until
after
the
establishment
of
the
federal
constitution
that
a
army
could
be
provided
to
guarantee
peace
on
the
border
in
the
second
place
british
garrisons
still
occupied
forts
on
lake
erie
pending
the
execution
of
the
terms
of
the
treaty
of
terms
which
were
not
fulfilled
until
after
the
ratification
of
the
jay
treaty
twelve
years
later
in
the
third
place
virginia
connecticut
and
massachusetts
had
conflicting
claims
to
the
land
in
the
northwest
based
on
old
english
charters
and
indian
treaties
it
was
only
after
a
bitter
contest
that
the
states
reached
an
agreement
to
transfer
their
rights
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
virginia
executing
her
deed
of
cession
on
march
in
the
fourth
place
titles
to
lands
bought
by
individuals
remained
uncertain
in
the
absence
of
official
maps
and
records
to
meet
this
last
situation
congress
instituted
a
systematic
survey
of
the
ohio
country
laying
it
out
into
townships
sections
of
acres
each
and
quarter
sections
in
every
township
one
section
of
land
was
set
aside
for
the
support
of
public
schools
northwest
the
final
problem
which
had
to
be
solved
before
settlement
on
a
large
scale
could
be
begun
was
that
of
governing
the
territory
pioneers
who
looked
with
hungry
eyes
on
the
fertile
valley
of
the
ohio
could
hardly
restrain
their
impatience
soldiers
of
the
revolution
who
had
been
paid
for
their
services
in
land
warrants
entitling
them
to
make
entries
in
the
west
called
for
action
congress
answered
by
passing
in
the
famous
northwest
ordinance
providing
for
temporary
territorial
government
to
be
followed
by
the
creation
of
a
popular
assembly
as
soon
as
there
were
five
thousand
free
males
in
any
district
eventual
admission
to
the
union
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
was
promised
to
the
new
territories
religious
freedom
was
guaranteed
the
safeguards
of
trial
by
jury
regular
judicial
procedure
and
were
established
in
order
that
the
methods
of
civilized
life
might
take
the
place
of
the
justice
of
lynch
law
during
the
course
of
the
debate
on
the
ordinance
congress
added
the
sixth
article
forbidding
slavery
and
involuntary
servitude
this
charter
of
the
northwest
so
well
planned
by
the
congress
under
the
articles
of
confederation
was
continued
in
force
by
the
first
congress
under
the
constitution
in
the
following
year
its
essential
provisions
except
the
ban
on
slavery
were
applied
to
the
territory
south
of
the
ohio
ceded
by
north
carolina
to
the
national
government
and
in
to
the
mississippi
territory
once
held
by
georgia
thus
it
was
settled
for
all
time
that
the
new
colonies
were
not
to
be
exploited
for
the
benefit
of
the
parent
states
any
more
than
for
the
benefit
of
england
but
were
to
be
autonomous
and
coördinate
commonwealths
this
outcome
bitterly
opposed
by
some
eastern
leaders
who
feared
the
triumph
of
western
states
over
the
seaboard
completed
the
legal
steps
necessary
by
way
of
preparation
for
the
flood
of
settlers
land
companies
speculators
and
western
land
as
in
the
original
settlement
of
america
so
in
the
opening
of
the
west
great
companies
and
single
proprietors
of
large
grants
early
figured
in
the
ohio
land
company
a
new
england
concern
acquired
a
million
and
a
half
acres
on
the
ohio
and
began
operations
by
planting
the
town
of
marietta
a
professional
land
speculator
symmes
secured
a
million
acres
lower
down
where
the
city
of
cincinnati
was
founded
other
individuals
bought
up
soldiers
claims
and
so
acquired
enormous
holdings
for
speculative
purposes
indeed
there
was
such
a
rush
to
make
fortunes
quickly
through
the
rise
in
land
values
that
washington
was
moved
to
cry
out
against
the
rage
for
speculating
in
and
forestalling
of
land
on
the
north
west
of
the
ohio
protesting
that
scarce
a
valuable
spot
within
any
tolerable
distance
of
it
is
left
without
a
claimant
he
therefore
urged
congress
to
fix
a
reasonable
price
for
the
land
not
too
exorbitant
and
burdensome
for
real
occupiers
but
high
enough
to
discourage
monopolizers
congress
however
was
not
prepared
to
use
the
public
domain
for
the
sole
purpose
of
developing
a
body
of
small
freeholders
in
the
west
it
still
looked
upon
the
sale
of
public
lands
as
an
important
source
of
revenue
with
which
to
pay
off
the
public
debt
consequently
it
thought
more
of
instant
income
than
of
ultimate
results
it
placed
no
limit
on
the
amount
which
could
be
bought
when
it
fixed
the
price
at
an
acre
in
and
it
encouraged
the
professional
land
operator
by
making
the
first
installment
only
twenty
cents
an
acre
in
addition
to
the
small
registration
and
survey
fee
on
such
terms
a
speculator
with
a
few
thousand
dollars
could
get
possession
of
an
enormous
plot
of
land
if
he
was
fortunate
in
disposing
of
it
he
could
meet
the
installments
which
were
spread
over
a
period
of
four
years
and
make
a
handsome
profit
for
himself
even
when
the
credit
or
installment
feature
was
abolished
in
and
the
price
of
the
land
lowered
to
a
cash
price
of
an
acre
the
opportunity
for
large
speculative
purchases
continued
to
attract
capital
to
land
ventures
development
of
the
small
the
cheapness
of
land
and
the
scarcity
of
labor
nevertheless
made
impossible
the
triumph
of
the
huge
estate
with
its
tenantry
for
about
a
man
could
get
a
farm
of
acres
on
the
installment
plan
another
payment
of
was
due
in
forty
days
but
a
term
was
allowed
for
the
discharge
of
the
balance
with
a
capital
of
from
two
to
three
hundred
dollars
a
family
could
embark
on
a
land
venture
if
it
had
good
crops
it
could
meet
the
deferred
payments
it
was
however
a
hard
battle
at
best
many
a
man
forfeited
his
land
through
failure
to
pay
the
final
installment
yet
in
the
end
in
spite
of
all
the
handicaps
the
small
freehold
of
a
few
hundred
acres
at
most
became
the
typical
unit
of
western
agriculture
except
in
the
planting
states
of
the
gulf
even
the
lands
of
the
great
companies
were
generally
broken
up
and
sold
in
small
lots
the
tendency
toward
moderate
holdings
so
favored
by
western
conditions
was
also
promoted
by
a
clause
in
the
northwest
ordinance
declaring
that
the
land
of
any
person
dying
intestate
that
is
without
any
will
disposing
of
it
should
be
divided
equally
among
his
descendants
hildreth
says
of
this
provision
it
established
the
important
republican
principle
not
then
introduced
into
all
the
states
of
the
equal
distribution
of
landed
as
well
as
personal
property
all
these
forces
combined
made
the
wide
dispersion
of
wealth
in
the
early
days
of
the
nineteenth
century
an
american
characteristic
in
marked
contrast
with
the
european
system
of
family
prestige
and
vast
estates
based
on
the
law
of
primogeniture
the
western
migration
and
new
states
with
government
established
federal
arms
victorious
over
the
indians
and
the
lands
surveyed
for
sale
the
way
was
prepared
for
the
immigrants
they
came
with
a
rush
young
new
englanders
weary
of
tilling
the
stony
soil
of
their
native
states
poured
through
new
york
and
pennsylvania
some
settling
on
the
northern
bank
of
the
ohio
but
most
of
them
in
the
lake
region
sons
and
daughters
of
german
farmers
in
pennsylvania
and
many
a
redemptioner
who
had
discharged
his
bond
of
servitude
pressed
out
into
ohio
kentucky
tennessee
or
beyond
from
the
exhausted
fields
and
the
clay
hills
of
the
southern
states
came
pioneers
of
english
and
descent
the
latter
in
great
numbers
indeed
one
historian
of
high
authority
has
ventured
to
say
that
the
rapid
expansion
of
the
united
states
from
a
coast
strip
to
a
continental
area
is
largely
a
achievement
while
native
americans
of
mixed
stocks
led
the
way
into
the
west
it
was
not
long
before
immigrants
direct
from
europe
under
the
stimulus
of
company
enterprise
began
to
filter
into
the
new
settlements
in
increasing
numbers
the
types
of
people
were
as
various
as
the
nations
they
represented
timothy
flint
who
published
his
entertaining
in
found
the
west
a
strange
mixture
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
people
some
of
them
he
relates
had
been
hunters
in
the
upper
world
of
the
mississippi
above
the
falls
of
anthony
some
had
been
still
farther
north
in
canada
still
others
had
wandered
from
the
south
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
red
river
and
the
spanish
country
french
boatmen
and
trappers
spanish
traders
from
the
southwest
virginia
planters
with
their
droves
of
slaves
mingled
with
english
german
and
farmers
hunters
forest
rangers
restless
bordermen
and
squatters
like
the
foaming
combers
of
an
advancing
tide
went
first
then
followed
the
farmers
masters
of
the
ax
and
plow
with
their
wives
who
shared
every
burden
and
hardship
and
introduced
some
of
the
features
of
civilized
life
the
hunters
and
rangers
passed
on
to
new
scenes
the
home
makers
built
for
all
time
number
of
there
were
no
official
stations
on
the
frontier
to
record
the
number
of
immigrants
who
entered
the
west
during
the
decades
following
the
american
revolution
but
travelers
of
the
time
record
that
every
road
was
crowded
with
pioneers
and
their
families
their
wagons
and
cattle
and
that
they
were
seldom
out
of
the
sound
of
the
snapping
whip
of
the
teamster
urging
forward
his
horses
or
the
crack
of
the
hunter
rifle
as
he
brought
down
his
evening
meal
during
the
latter
half
of
says
coman
more
than
nine
hundred
boats
floated
down
the
ohio
carrying
eighteen
thousand
men
women
and
children
and
twelve
thousand
horses
sheep
and
cattle
and
six
hundred
and
fifty
wagons
other
lines
of
travel
were
also
crowded
and
with
the
passing
years
the
flooding
tide
of
home
seekers
rose
higher
and
higher
western
four
main
routes
led
into
the
country
beyond
the
appalachians
the
genesee
road
beginning
at
albany
ran
almost
due
west
to
the
present
site
of
buffalo
on
lake
erie
through
a
level
country
in
the
dry
season
wagons
laden
with
goods
could
easily
pass
along
it
into
northern
ohio
a
second
route
through
pittsburgh
was
fed
by
three
eastern
branches
one
starting
at
philadelphia
one
at
baltimore
and
another
at
alexandria
a
third
main
route
wound
through
the
mountains
from
alexandria
to
boonesboro
in
kentucky
and
then
westward
across
the
ohio
to
louis
a
fourth
the
most
famous
of
them
all
passed
through
the
cumberland
gap
and
by
branches
extended
into
the
cumberland
valley
and
the
kentucky
country
of
these
four
lines
of
travel
the
pittsburgh
route
offered
the
most
advantages
pioneers
no
matter
from
what
section
they
came
when
once
they
were
on
the
headwaters
of
the
ohio
and
in
possession
of
a
flatboat
could
find
a
quick
and
easy
passage
into
all
parts
of
the
west
and
southwest
whether
they
wanted
to
settle
in
ohio
kentucky
or
western
tennessee
they
could
find
their
way
down
the
drifting
flood
to
their
destination
or
at
least
to
some
spot
near
it
many
people
from
the
south
as
well
as
the
northern
and
middle
states
chose
this
route
so
it
came
about
that
the
sons
and
daughters
of
virginia
and
the
carolinas
mingled
with
those
of
new
york
pennsylvania
and
new
england

the
settlement

northwest
territory

the
many
stories
giving
exact
descriptions
of
methods
of
travel
into
the
west
in
the
early
days
have
been
preserved
the
country
was
hardly
opened
before
visitors
from
the
old
world
and
from
the
eastern
states
impelled
by
curiosity
made
their
way
to
the
very
frontier
of
civilization
and
wrote
books
to
inform
or
amuse
the
public
one
of
them
gilbert
imlay
an
english
traveler
has
given
us
an
account
of
the
pittsburgh
route
as
he
found
it
in
if
a
man
he
writes
has
a
family
or
goods
of
any
sort
to
remove
his
best
way
then
would
be
to
purchase
a
waggon
and
team
of
horses
to
carry
his
property
to
redstone
old
fort
or
to
pittsburgh
according
as
he
may
come
from
the
northern
or
southern
states
a
good
waggon
will
cost
at
philadelphia
about
and
the
horses
about
each
they
would
cost
something
more
both
at
baltimore
and
alexandria
the
waggon
may
be
covered
with
canvass
and
if
it
is
the
choice
of
the
people
they
may
sleep
in
it
of
nights
with
the
greatest
safety
but
if
they
dislike
that
there
are
inns
of
accommodation
the
whole
distance
on
the
different
roads
the
provisions
i
would
purchase
in
the
same
manner
that
is
from
the
farmers
along
the
road
and
by
having
two
or
three
camp
kettles
and
stopping
every
evening
when
the
weather
is
fine
upon
the
brink
of
some
rivulet
and
by
kindling
a
fire
they
may
soon
dress
their
own
food
this
manner
of
journeying
is
so
far
from
being
disagreeable
that
in
a
fine
season
it
is
extremely
pleasant
the
immigrant
once
at
pittsburgh
or
wheeling
could
then
buy
a
flatboat
of
a
size
required
for
his
goods
and
stock
and
drift
down

tennessee

in
kentucky
took

none

the
eastern
federalists
resented

they
took
some
consolation
in
the
admission
of

because
the
balance
of
eastern
power
was
still
retained

from

the
little

grown
into

the

this

assembled
under

at

the

bore
such

and
the

included

hoping
for

in

from

up
for

under

authority
of
an
act
of

inaugurated
their

at
corydon
the
majority
of
the
members
of
the
convention
we
are
told
by
a
local
historian
were
frontier
farmers
who
had
a
general
idea
of
what
they
wanted
and
had
sense
enough
to
let
their
more
erudite
colleagues
put
it
into
shape
two
years
later
the
pioneers
of
illinois
also
settled
upward
from
the
ohio
like
indiana

their

to
draft
a

in
the
convention
quite
properly
was
taken
by
a
man
born
in
new
york
and
reared
in
tennessee
and
the
constitution
as
finally
drafted
was
in
its
principal
provisions
a
copy
of
the
then
existing

of

that
if

passes
the

dissolved
that
as
it

be
the

violently

death
blow

lingering
its

at
no
very
distant
period
be
consummated
federalists
from

like
those
from

had
their
doubts
about
the
wisdom
of
admitting
western
states
but
the
party
of
jefferson

granted
the

in
when
a
few
years
later

knocked
at

doors
of

the
federalists
had
so
little
influence
on

of
their
conduct
during
the
second
war
with

that
spokesmen
from
the

met
a

reception
at

in

their

the

made
them

came
when

people
so
independent

the

many
a
rude
shock
setting
gentlemen
in

and
knee
breeches
agog
with
the
idea
that
terrible
things
might
happen
in

did
washington
fear
that
a
touch
of
a
feather
would
turn
the
western

away
from
the

to
the
spaniards

seriously
did

urge

to

in
that
region
at

to
build
a
state
of
some
kind
out
of
the
spanish

adjoining

at
such
enterprises

fearing
the
dominance

the

with
a
few
conspicuous
exceptions
opposed

between
the
sections
had
their
narrow
views
prevailed
the
west
with
its
new
democracy
would
have
been
held
in
perpetual
tutelage
to
the
seaboard
or
perhaps
been
driven
into
independence
as
the
thirteen
colonies
had
been
not
long
before
friends
of
the
fortunately
for
the
nation
there
were
many
eastern
leaders
particularly
from
the
south
who
understood
the
west
approved
its
spirit
and
sought
to
bring
the
two
sections
together
by
common
bonds
washington
kept
alive
and
keen
the
zeal
for
western
advancement
which
he
acquired
in
his
youth
as
a
surveyor
he
never
grew
tired
of
urging
upon
his
eastern
friends
the
importance
of
the
lands
beyond
the
mountains
he
pressed
upon
the
governor
of
virginia
a
project
for
a
wagon
road
connecting
the
seaboard
with
the
ohio
country
and
was
active
in
a
movement
to
improve
the
navigation
of

potomac
he
advocated
strengthening
the
ties
of
commerce
smooth
the
roads
he
said
and
make
easy
the
way
for
them
and
then
see
what
an
influx
of
articles
will
be
poured
upon
us
how
amazingly
our
exports
will
be
increased
by
them
and
how
amply
we
shall
be
compensated
for
any
trouble
and
expense
we
may
encounter
to
effect
it
jefferson
too
was
interested
in
every
phase
of
western
development
the
survey
of
lands
the
exploration
of
waterways
the
opening
of
trade
and
even
the
discovery
of
the
bones
of
prehistoric

robert
fulton
the
inventor
of
the
steamboat
was
another
man
of
vision

for
many
years
pressed
upon
his
countrymen
the
necessity
of
uniting
east

west
by
a
canal
which
would
cement
the
union

value

extend

communication
played
an
important
part
in
the
strategy
of
all
those
who
sought
to
bring
together
the
seaboard
and
the
frontier
the
produce
of
the
west
wheat
corn

tobacco

bulky

the
cost
of
overland

was
prohibitive

eastern

a
cow
and
her
calf
were
given
for
a
bushel
of
salt
while
a
suit
of
clothes
cost
as
much
as
a
farm
in
such
circumstances
the
inhabitants
of
the
mississippi
valley
were
forced
to
ship
their
produce
over
a
long
route
by
way
of
new
orleans
and
to
pay
high
freight
rates
for
everything
that
was
brought
across
the
mountains
scows
of
from
five
to
fifty

the
solution

dedicated
a

emptying
into
the

beyond

a

federalists
at
the
hartford
convention
prophesied
that
in
time
the
west
would
dominate
the
east
at
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
they
said
a
certain
balance
of
power
among
the
original
states
was
considered
to
exist
and
there
was
at
that
time
and
yet
is
among
those
parties
a
strong
affinity
between
their
great
and
general
interests
by
the
admission
of
these
new
states
that
balance
has
been
materially
affected
and
unless
the
practice
be
modified
must
ultimately
be
destroyed
the
southern
states
will
first
avail
themselves
of
their
new
confederates
to
govern
the
east
and
finally
the
western
states
multiplied
in
number
and
augmented
in
population
will
control
the
interests
of
the
whole
strangely
enough
the
fulfillment
of
this
prophecy
was
being
prepared
even
in
federalist
strongholds
by
the
rise
of
a
new
urban
democracy
that
was
to
make

the
farmers
beyond
the
mountains
the
democratic
movement
in
the
east
aristocratic
features
of
the
old
the
revolutionary
fathers
in
setting
up
their
first
state
constitutions
although
they
often
spoke
of
government
as
founded
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
did
not
think
that
consistency
required
giving
the
vote
to
all
adult
males
on
the
contrary
they
looked
upon
property
owners
as
the
only
safe
depositary
of
political
power
they
went
back
to
the
colonial
tradition
that
related
taxation
and
representation
this
they
argued
was
not
only
just
but
a
safeguard
against
the
excesses
of
democracy
in
carrying
their
theory
into
execution
they
placed
taxpaying
or
property
qualifications
on
the
right
to
vote
broadly
speaking
these
limitations
fell
into
three
classes
three
states
pennsylvania
new
hampshire
and
georgia
gave
the
ballot
to
all
who
paid
taxes
without
reference
to
the
value
of
their
property

virginia
delaware
and
rhode
island
clung
firmly
to
the
ancient
principles
that
only
freeholders
could
be
intrusted
with
electoral
rights
still
other
states
while
closely
restricting
the
suffrage
accepted
the
ownership
of
other
things
as
well
as
land
in
fulfillment
of
the
requirements
in
massachusetts
for
instance
the
vote
was
granted
to
all
men
who
held
land
yielding
an
annual
income
of
three
pounds
or
possessed
other
property
worth
sixty
pounds
the
electors
thus
enfranchised
numerous
as
they
were
owing
to
the
wide
distribution
of
land
often
suffered
from
a
very
onerous
disability
in
many
states
they
were
able
to
vote
only
for
persons
of
wealth
because
heavy
property
qualifications
were
imposed
on

provisions
no

sect
was
powerful
enough
to
dominate
after

but
for
the
most
part
catholics
and

were
either
disfranchised
or
excluded
from

north

georgia

the
ballot

in

they
were
viewed

of

it
is
entirely
just
that
property
should
have
its
due
weight
and

arrangements

jefferson
himself
had
first
believed
in
property
qualifications
and
had
feared
with
genuine
alarm
the
mobs
of
the
great
cities
it
was
near
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
before
he
accepted
the
idea
of
manhood
suffrage
even
then
he
was
unable
to
convince
the
of
his
own
state
it
is
not
an
idle
chimera
of
the
brain
urged
one
of
them
that
the
possession
of
land
furnishes
the
strongest
evidence
of
permanent
common
interest
with
and
attachment
to
the
community
it
is
upon
this
foundation
i
wish
to
place
the
right
of
suffrage
this
is
the
best
general
standard
which
can
be
resorted
to
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
persons
to
be
invested
with
the
right
of
suffrage
are
such
persons
as
could
be
consistently
with
the
safety
and
of
the
community
intrusted
with
the
exercise
of
that
right
on
the
restricted
the
changing
circumstances
of
american
life
however
soon
challenged
the
rule
of
those
with
property
prominent
among
the
new
forces
were
the
rising
mercantile
and
business
interests
where
the
freehold
qualification
was
applied
business
men
who
did
not
own
land
were
deprived
of
the
vote
and
excluded
from
office
in
new
york
for
example
the
most
illiterate
farmer
who
had
one
hundred
pounds
worth
of
land
could
vote
for
state
senator
and
governor
while
the
landless
banker
or
merchant
could
not
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
to
find
business
men
taking
the
lead
in
breaking
down
freehold
limitations
on
the
suffrage
the
professional
classes
also
were
interested
in
removing
the
barriers
which
excluded
many
of
them
from
public
affairs
it
was
a
schoolmaster
thomas
dorr
who
led
the
popular
uprising
in
rhode
island
which
brought
the
exclusive
rule
by
freeholders
to
an
end
in
addition
to
the
business
and
professional
classes
the
mechanics
of
the
towns
showed
a
growing
hostility
to
a
system
of
government
that
generally
barred
them
from
voting
or
holding
office
though
not
numerous
they
had
early
begun
to
exercise
an
influence
on
the

were
framed

took
a
lively
interest
particularly
in
new
york
city
and
philadelphia
in
june
the
mechanicks
in
union
in
new
york
protested
against
putting
the
new
state
constitution
into
effect
without
their
approval
declaring
that
the
right
to
vote
on
the
acceptance
or
rejection
of
a
fundamental
law
is
the
birthright
of
every
man
to
whatever
state
he
may
belong
though
their
petition
was
rejected
their
spirit
remained
when
a
few
years
later
the
federal
constitution
was
being
framed
the
mechanics
watched
the
process
with
deep
concern
they
knew
that
one
of
its
main
objects
was
to
promote
trade
and
commerce
affecting
directly
their
daily
bread
during
the
struggle
over
ratification
they
passed
resolutions
approving
its
provisions
and
they
often
joined
in
parades
organized
to
stir
up
sentiment
for
the
constitution
even
though
they
could
not
vote
for
members
of
the
state
conventions
and
so
express
their
will
directly
after
the
organization
of
trade
unions
they
collided
with
the
courts
of
law
and
thus
became
interested
in
the
election
of
judges
and
lawmakers
those
who
attacked
the
old
system
of
class
rule
found
a
strong
moral
support
in
the
declaration
of
independence
was
it
not
said
that
all
men
are
created
equal
whoever
runs
may
read
was
it
not
declared
that
governments
derive
their
just
power
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
that
doctrine
was
applied
with
effect
to
george
iii
and
seemed
appropriate
for
use
against
the
privileged
classes
of
massachusetts
or
virginia

principles
thus
proclaimed

the
of

regulation

a
regulation

instead
of
the
equality

ordains
creates
an
odious
distinction
between
members
of
the
same

and
vests
in
a
favored
class

in
consideration
of

public
services

of

the
spirit
of

soon
had
a
pronounced
effect
on
the
machinery
of
government
and

practice
of
politics

were
not

and
rotation
in

they
wanted

regardless
of

they
therefore
extended
the
system
of
rewarding
party
workers
with
government
positions
a
system
early
established
in
several
states
notably
new
york
and
pennsylvania
closely
connected
with

practice

fixing

offered
was
the
historic
doctrine
of

its

the
framers
of

bewildered
by
many
proposals
and
unable
to
agree
on
any
single
plan
had
committed
the
choice
of

to
the
discretion

adopted
the

reluctantly
they

methods
of
democracy
nominating
as
the
suffrage
was
widened
and
the
popular
choice
of
presidential
electors
extended
there
arose
a
violent
protest
against
the
methods
used
by
the
political
parties
in
nominating
candidates
after
the
retirement
of
washington
both
the
republicans
and
the
federalists
found
it
necessary
to
agree
upon
their
favorites
before
the
election
and
they
adopted
a
colonial
device
the
caucus
the
federalist
members
of
congress
held
a
conference
and
selected
their
candidate
and
the
republicans
followed
the
example
in
a
short
time
the
practice
of
nominating
by
a
congressional
caucus
became
a
recognized
institution
the
election
still
remained
with
the
people
but
the
power
of
picking
candidates
for
their
approval
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
small
body
of
senators
and
representatives
a
reaction
against
this
was
unavoidable
to
friends
of
the
plain
people
like
andrew
jackson
it
was
intolerable
all
the
more
so
because
the
caucus
never
favored
him
with
the
nomination
more
conservative
men
also
found
grave
objections
to
it
they
pointed
out
that
whereas
the
constitution
intended
the
president
to
be
an
independent
officer
he
had
now
fallen
under
the
control
of
a
caucus
of
congressmen
the
supremacy
of
the
legislative
branch
had
been
obtained
by
an
political
device
to
such
objections
were
added
practical
considerations
in
when
personal
rivalry
had
taken
the
place
of
party
conflicts
the
congressional
caucus
selected
as
the
candidate
william
crawford
of
georgia
a
man
of
distinction
but
no
great
popularity
passing
by
such
an
obvious
hero
as
general
jackson
the
followers
of
the
general
were
enraged
and
demanded
nothing
short
of
the
death
of
king
caucus
their
clamor
was
effective
under
their
attacks
the
caucus
came
to
an
ignominious
end
in
place
of
it
there
arose
in
a
new
device
the
national
nominating
convention
composed
of
delegates
elected
by
party
voters
for
the
sole
purpose
of
nominating
candidates
senators
and
representatives
were
still
prominent
in
the
party
councils
but
they
were
swamped
by
hundreds
of
delegates
fresh
from
the
people
as
jackson
was
wont
to
say
in
fact
each
convention
was
made
up
mainly
of
office
holders
and
office
seekers
and
the
new
institution
was
soon
denounced
as
vigorously
as
king
caucus
had
been
particularly
by
statesmen
who
failed
to
obtain
a
nomination
still
it
grew
in
strength
and
by
was
firmly
established
end
of
the
old
in
the
election
of
the
representatives
of
the
aristocracy
made
their
last
successful
stand
until
then
the
leadership
by
men
of
wealth
and
talents
had
been
undisputed
there
had
been
five
presidents
washington
john
adams
jefferson
madison
and
monroe
all
eastern
men
brought
up
in
prosperous
families
with
the
advantages
of
culture
which
come
from
leisure
and
the
possession
of
life
refinements
none
of
them
had
ever
been
compelled
to
work
with
his
hands
for
a
livelihood
four
of
them
had
been
slaveholders
jefferson
was
a
philosopher
learned
in
natural
science
a
master
of
foreign
languages
a
gentleman
of
dignity
and
grace
of
manner
notwithstanding
his
studied
simplicity
madison
it
was
said
was
armed
with
all
the
culture
of
his
century
monroe
was
a
graduate
of
william
and
mary
a
gentleman
of
the
old
school
jefferson
and
his
three
successors
called
themselves
republicans
and
professed
a
genuine
faith
in
the
people
but
they
were
not
of
the
people
themselves
they
were
not
sons
of
the
soil
or
the
workshop
they
were
all
men
of
the
grand
old
order
of
society
who
gave
finish
and
style
even
to
popular
government
monroe
was
the
last
of
the
presidents
belonging
to
the
heroic
epoch
of
the
revolution
he
had
served
in
the
war
for
independence
in
the
congress
under
the
articles
of
confederation
and
in
official
capacity
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
in
short
he
was
of
the
age
that
had
wrought
american
independence
and
set
the
government
afloat
with
his
passing
leadership
went
to
a
new
generation
but
his
successor
john
quincy
adams
formed
a
bridge
between
the
old
and
the
new
in
that
he
combined
a
high
degree
of
culture
with
democratic
sympathies
washington
had
died
in
preceded
but
a
few
months
by
patrick
henry
and
followed
in
four
years
by
samuel
adams
hamilton
had
been
killed
in
a
duel
with
burr
in
thomas
jefferson
and
john
adams
were
yet
alive
in
but
they
were
soon
to
pass
from
the
scene
reconciled
at
last
full
of
years
and
honors
madison
was
in
dignified
retirement
destined
to
live
long
enough
to
protest
against
the
doctrine
of
nullification
proclaimed
by
south
carolina
before
death
carried
him
away
at
the
ripe
old
age
of
election
of
john
quincy
adams
the
campaign
of
marked
the
end
of
the
era
of
good
feeling
inaugurated
by
the
collapse
of
the
federalist
party
after
the
election
of
there
were
four
leading
candidates
john
quincy
adams
andrew
jackson
henry
clay
and
crawford
the
result
of
the
election
was
a
division
of
the
electoral
votes
into
four
parts
and
no
one
received
a
majority
under
the
constitution
therefore
the
selection
of
president
passed
to
the
house
of
representatives
clay
who
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
poll
threw
his
weight
to
adams
and
assured
his
triumph
much
to
the
chagrin
of
jackson
friends
they
thought
with
a
certain
justification
that
inasmuch
as
the
hero
of
new
orleans
had
received
the
largest
electoral
vote
the
house
was
morally
bound
to
accept
the
popular
judgment
and
make
him
president
jackson
shook
hands
cordially
with
adams
on
the
day
of
the
inauguration
but
never
forgave
him
for
being
elected
while
adams
called
himself
a
republican
in
politics
and
often
spoke
of
the
rule
of
the
people
he
was
regarded
by
jackson
followers
as
an
aristocrat
he
was
not
a
son
of
the
soil
neither
was
he
acquainted
at
first
hand
with
the
labor
of
farmers
and
mechanics
he
had
been
educated
at
harvard
and
in
europe
like
his
illustrious
father
john
adams
he
was
a
stern
and
reserved
man
little
given
to
seeking
popularity
moreover
he
was
from
the
east
and
the
frontiersmen
of
the
west
regarded
him
as
a
man
born
with
a
silver
spoon
in
his
mouth
supporters
especially
disliked
him
because
they
thought
their
hero
entitled
to
the
presidency
their
anger
was
deepened
when
adams
appointed
clay
to
the
office
of
secretary
of
state
and
they
set
up
a
cry
that
there
had
been
a
deal
by
which
clay
had
helped
to
elect
adams
to
get
office
for
himself
though
adams
conducted
his
administration
with
great
dignity
and
in
a
fine
spirit
of
public
service
he
was
unable
to
overcome
the
opposition
which
he
encountered
on
his
election
to
office
or
to
win
popularity
in
the
west
and
south
on
the
contrary
by
advocating
government
assistance
in
building
roads
and
canals
and
public
grants
in
aid
of
education
arts
and
sciences
he
ran
counter
to
the
current
which
had
set
in
against
appropriations
of
federal
funds
for
internal
improvements
by
signing
the
tariff
bill
of
soon
known
as
the
tariff
of
abominations
he
made
new
enemies
without
adding
to
his
friends
in
new
york
pennsylvania
and
ohio
where
he
sorely
needed
them
handicapped
by
the
false
charge
that
he
had
been
a
party
to
a
corrupt
bargain
with
clay
to
secure
his
first
election
attacked
for
his
advocacy
of
a
high
protective
tariff
charged
with
favoring
an
aristocracy
of
in
washington
on
account
of
his
refusal
to
discharge
government
clerks
by
the
wholesale
adams
was
retired
from
the
white
house
after
he
had
served
four
years
triumph
of
jackson
in
probably
no
candidate
for
the
presidency
ever
had
such
passionate
popular
support
as
andrew
jackson
had
in
he
was
truly
a
man
of
the
people
born
of
poor
parents
in
the
upland
region
of
south
carolina
schooled
in
poverty
and
adversity
without
the
advantages
of
education
or
the
refinements
of
cultivated
leisure
he
seemed
the
embodiment
of
the
spirit
of
the
new
american
democracy
early
in
his
youth
he
had
gone
into
the
frontier
of
tennessee
where
he
soon
won
a
name
as
a
fearless
and
intrepid
indian
fighter
on
the
march
and
in
camp
he
endeared
himself
to
his
men
by
sharing
their
hardships
sleeping
on
the
ground
with
them
and
eating
parched
corn
when
nothing
better
could
be
found
for
the
privates
from
local
prominence
he
sprang
into
national
fame
by
his
exploit
at
the
battle
of
new
orleans
his
reputation
as
a
military
hero
was
enhanced
by
the
feeling
that
he
had
been
a
martyr
to
political
treachery
in
the
farmers
of
the
west
and
south
claimed
him
as
their
own
the
mechanics
of
the
eastern
cities
newly
enfranchised
also
looked
upon
him
as
their
friend
though
his
views
on
the
tariff
internal
improvements
and
other
issues
before
the
country
were
either
vague
or
unknown
he
was
readily
elected
president
the
returns
of
the
electoral
vote
in
revealed
the
sources
of
jackson
power
in
new
england
he
received
but
one
ballot
from
maine
he
had
a
majority
of
the
electors
in
new
york
and
all
of
them
in
pennsylvania
and
he
carried
every
state
south
of
maryland
and
beyond
the
appalachians
adams
did
not
get
a
single
electoral
vote
in
the
south
and
west
the
prophecy
of
the
hartford
convention
had
been
fulfilled
illustration
andrew
jackson
when
jackson
took
the
oath
of
office
on
march
the
government
of
the
united
states
entered
into
a
new
era
until
this
time
the
inauguration
of
a
president
even
that
of
jefferson
the
apostle
of
simplicity
had
brought
no
rude
shock
to
the
course
of
affairs
at
the
capital
hitherto
the
installation
of
a
president
meant
that
an
gentleman
accompanied
by
a
few
servants
had
driven
to
the
white
house
in
his
own
coach
taken
the
oath
with
quiet
dignity
appointed
a
few
new
men
to
the
higher
posts
continued
in
office
the
long
list
of
regular
civil
employees
and
begun
his
administration
with
respectable
decorum
jackson
changed
all
this
when
he
was
inaugurated
men
and
women
journeyed
hundreds
of
miles
to
witness
the
ceremony
great
throngs
pressed
into
the
white
house
upset
the
bowls
of
punch
broke
the
glasses
and
stood
with
their
muddy
boots
on
the
chairs
to
see
the
people
president
if
jefferson
inauguration
was
as
he
called
it
the
great
revolution
jackson
inauguration
was
a
cataclysm
the
new
democracy
at
washington
spoils
the
staid
and
respectable
society
of
washington
was
disturbed
by
this
influx
of
farmers
and
frontiersmen
to
speak
of
politics
became
bad
form
among
fashionable
women
the
clerks
and
civil
servants
of
the
government
who
had
enjoyed
long
and
secure
tenure
of
office
became
alarmed
at
the
clamor
of
new
men
for
their
positions
doubtless
the
major
portion
of
them
had
opposed
the
election
of
jackson
and
looked
with
feelings
akin
to
contempt
upon
him
and
his
followers
with
a
hunter
instinct
jackson
scented
his
prey
determined
to
have
none
but
his
friends
in
office
he
made
a
clean
sweep
expelling
old
employees
to
make
room
for
men
fresh
from
the
people
this
was
a
new
custom
other
presidents
had
discharged
a
few
officers
for
engaging
in
opposition
politics
they
had
been
careful
in
making
appointments
not
to
choose
inveterate
enemies
but
they
discharged
relatively
few
men
on
account
of
their
political
views
and
partisan
activities
by
wholesale
removals
and
the
frank
selection
of
officers
on
party
grounds
a
practice
already
well
intrenched
in
new
york
jackson
established
the
spoils
system
at
washington
the
famous
slogan
to
the
victor
belong
the
spoils
of
victory
became
the
avowed
principle
of
the
national
government
statesmen
like
calhoun
denounced
it
poets
like
james
russell
lowell
ridiculed
it
faithful
servants
of
the
government
suffered
under
it
but
it
held
undisturbed
sway
for
half
a
century
thereafter
each
succeeding
generation
outdoing
if
possible
its
predecessor
in
the
use
of
public
office
for
political
purposes
if
any
one
remarked
that
training
and
experience
were
necessary
qualifications
for
important
public
positions
he
met
jackson
own
profession
of
faith
the
duties
of
any
public
office
are
so
simple
or
admit
of
being
made
so
simple
that
any
man
can
in
a
short
time
become
master
of
them
tariff
and
jackson
had
not
been
installed
in
power
very
long
before
he
was
compelled
to
choose
between
states
rights
and
nationalism
the
immediate
occasion
of
the
trouble
was
the
tariff
a
matter
on
which
jackson
did
not
have
any
very
decided
views
his
mind
did
not
run
naturally
to
abstruse
economic
questions
and
owing
to
the
divided
opinion
of
the
country
it
was
good
politics
to
be
vague
and
ambiguous
in
the
controversy
especially
was
this
true
because
the
tariff
issue
was
threatening
to
split
the
country
into
parties
again
development
of
the
policy
of

the

of
and
the
commercial
policies
of

which
followed
it
had
accentuated
the
need
for
american
economic
independence
during
that
conflict
the
united
states
cut
off
from
english
manufactures
as
during
the
revolution
built
up
home
industries
to
meet
the
unusual
call
for
iron
steel
cloth
and
other
military
and
naval
supplies
as
well
as
the
demands
from
ordinary
markets
iron
foundries
and
textile
mills
sprang
up
as
in
the
night
hundreds
of
business
men
invested
fortunes
in
industrial
enterprises
so
essential
to
the
military
needs
of
the
government
and
the
people
at
large
fell
into
the
habit
of
buying
goods
again
as
the
london
tersely
observed
of
the
americans
their
first
war
with
england
made
them
independent
their
second
war
made
them
formidable
in
recognition
of
this
state
of
affairs
the
tariff
of
was
designed
to
prevent
england
from
ruining
these
infant
industries
by
dumping
the
accumulated
stores
of
years
suddenly
upon
american
markets
and
to
enlarge
in
the
manufacturing
centers
the
demand
for
american
agricultural
produce
it
accomplished
the
purposes
of
its
framers
it
kept
in
operation
the
mills
and
furnaces
so
recently
built
it
multiplied
the
number
of
industrial
workers
and
enhanced
the
demand
for
the
produce
of
the
soil
it
brought
about
another
very
important
result
it
turned
the
capital
and
enterprise
of
new
england
from
shipping
to
manufacturing
and
converted
her
statesmen
once
friends
of
low
tariffs
into
ardent
advocates
of
protection
in
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
yankees
had
bent
their
energies
toward
building
and
operating
ships
to
carry
produce
from
america
to
europe
and
manufactures
from
europe
to
america
for
this
reason
they
had
opposed
the
tariff
of
calculated
to
increase
domestic
production
and
cut
down
the
carrying
trade
defeated
in
their
efforts
they
accepted
the
inevitable
and
turned
to
manufacturing
soon
they
were
powerful
friends
of
protection
for
american
enterprise
as
the
money
invested
and
the
labor
employed
in
the
favored
industries
increased
the
demand
for
continued
and
heavier
protection
grew
apace
even
the
farmers
who
furnished
raw
materials
like
wool
flax
and
hemp
began
to
see
eye
to
eye
with
the
manufacturers
so
the
textile
interests
of
new
england
the
iron
masters
of
connecticut
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
the
wool
hemp
and
flax
growers
of
ohio
kentucky
and
tennessee
and
the
sugar
planters
of
louisiana
developed
into
a
formidable
combination
in
support
of
a
high
protective
tariff
planting
states
oppose
the
in
the
meantime
the
cotton
states
on
the
seaboard
had
forgotten
about
the
havoc
wrought
during
the
napoleonic
wars
when
their
produce
rotted
because
there
were
no
ships
to
carry
it
to
europe
the
seas
were
now
open
the
area
devoted
to
cotton
had
swiftly
expanded
as
alabama
mississippi
and
louisiana
were
opened
up
cotton
had
in
fact
become
king
and
the
planters
depended
for
their
prosperity
as
they
thought
upon
the
sale
of
their
staple
to
english
manufacturers
whose
spinning
and
weaving
mills
were
the
wonder
of
the
world
manufacturing
nothing
and
having
to
buy
nearly
everything
except
farm
produce
and
even
much
of
that
for
slaves
the
planters
naturally
wanted
to
purchase
manufactures
in
the
cheapest
market
england
where
they
sold
most
of
their
cotton
the
tariff
they
contended
raised
the
price
of
the
goods
they
had
to
buy
and
was
thus
in
fact
a
tribute
laid
on
them
for
the
benefit
of
the
northern
mill
owners
tariff
of
they
were
overborne
however
in
and
again
in
when
northern
manufacturers
and
western
farmers
forced
congress
to
make
an
upward
revision

carolina
nullifies
the

passed
a

calling
for
a

duly
assembled
in
the

month
in
no
mood
for

it
adopted
the
famous
ordinance

after
a
few
days
debate
every
line
of
this
document
was
clear
and
firm
the
tariff
it
opened
gives
bounties
to
classes

at
the

and
to
the
injury
and
oppression
of
other

it

a
violation

therefore
null

void
its

is
unlawful
if

thenceforth

themselves
absolved
from
all
further
obligations
to
maintain

preserve
their

alabama

he
looked
with
no

feelings
upon
nullification
for
at
a
jefferson
dinner
in
the
spring
of
while
the
subject
was
in
the
air
he
had
with
laconic
firmness
announced
a
toast
our
federal
union
it
must
be
preserved
when
two
years
later
the
open
challenge
came
from
south
carolina
he
replied
that
he
would
enforce
the
law
saying
with
his
frontier
directness
if
a
single
drop
of
blood
shall
be
shed
there
in

that
i
can

he
made
ready
to
keep
his
word
by
preparing
for
the
use
of
military
and
naval
forces
in
sustaining
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
then
in
a
long
and
impassioned
proclamation
to
the
people
of
south
carolina
he
pointed
out
the
national
character
of
the
union
and
announced
his
solemn
resolve
to
preserve
it
by
all
constitutional
means
nullification
he
branded
as
incompatible
with
the
existence
of
the
union
contradicted
expressly
by
the
letter
of
the
constitution
unauthorized
by
its
spirit
inconsistent
with
every
principle
on
which
it
was
founded
and
destructive
of
the
great
objects
for
which
it
was
formed
in
his
messages
to
congress
however
jackson
spoke
the
language
of
conciliation
a
few
days
before
issuing
his
proclamation
he
suggested
that
protection
should
be
limited
to
the
articles
of
domestic
manufacture
indispensable
to
safety
in
war
time
and
shortly
afterward
he
asked
for
new
legislation
to
aid
him
in
enforcing
the
laws
with
two
propositions
before
it
one
to
remove
the
chief
grounds
for
south
carolina
resistance
and
the
other
to
apply
force
if
it
was

gradual
reduction

duties

by
they
would
reach
the
level
of
the
law

calhoun
had
supported
in
about
the

time
the
force
bill
designed
to
give
the
president
ample
authority
in
executing
the
law
in
south
carolina
was
taken
up
after
a
short
but
acrimonious
debate
both
measures
were
passed
and
signed
by
president
jackson
on
the
same
day
march
looking
upon
the
reduction
of
the
tariff
as
a
complete
vindication
of
her
policy
and
an
undoubted
victory
south

rescinded
her
ordinance
and
enacted
another
nullifying
the

bill
illustration
an
old
daniel

where
the
actual
victory
lay
in
this
quarrel
long
the
subject
of
high
dispute
need
not
concern
us
perhaps
the
chief
result
of
the
whole
affair
was
a
clarification
of
the
issue
between
the
north
and
the
south
a
definite
statement
of
the
principles
for
which
men
on
both
sides
were
years
afterward
to
lay
down
their
lives
on
behalf
of
nationalism
and
a
perpetual
union
the
stanch
old
democrat
from
tennessee
had
in
his
proclamation
on
nullification
spoken
a
language
that
admitted
of
only
one
meaning
on
behalf
of
nullification
senator
hayne
of
south
carolina
a
skilled
lawyer
and
courtly
orator
had
in
a
great
speech
delivered
in
the
senate
in
january
set
forth
clearly
and
cogently
the
doctrine
that
the
union
is
a
compact
among
sovereign
states
from
which
the
parties
may
lawfully
withdraw
it
was
this
address
that
called
into
the
arena
daniel
webster
senator
from
massachusetts
who
spreading
the
mantle
of
oblivion
over
the
hartford
convention
delivered
a
reply
to
hayne
that
has
been
reckoned
among
the
powerful
orations
of
all
time
a
plea
for
the
supremacy
of
the
constitution
and
the
national
character
of
the
union
war
on
the
united
states
if
events
forced
the
issue
of
nationalism
and
nullification
upon
jackson
the
same
could
not
be
said
of
his
attack
on
the
bank
that
institution
once
denounced
by
every
true
jeffersonian
had
been
reëstablished
in
under
the
administration
of
jefferson
disciple
james
madison
it
had
not
been
in
operation
very
long
however
before
it
aroused
bitter
opposition
especially
in
the
south
and
the
west
its
notes
drove
out
of
circulation
the
paper
currency
of
unsound
banks
chartered
by
the
states
to
the
great
anger
of
local
financiers
it
was
accused
of
favoritism
in
making
loans
of
conferring
special
privileges
upon
politicians
in
return
for
their
support
at
washington
to
all
jackson
followers
it
was
an
insidious
money
power
one
of
them
openly
denounced
it
as
an
institution
designed
to
strengthen
the
arm
of
wealth
and
counterpoise
the
influence
of
extended
suffrage
in
the
disposition
of
public
affairs
this
sentiment
president
jackson
fully
shared
in
his
first
message
to
congress
he
assailed
the
bank
in
vigorous
language
he
declared
that
its
constitutionality
was
in
doubt
and
alleged
that
it
had
failed
to
establish
a
sound
and
uniform
currency
if
such
an
institution
was
necessary
he
continued
it
should
be
a
public
bank
owned
and
managed
by
the
government
not
a
private
concern
endowed
with
special
privileges
by
it
in
his
second
and
third
messages
jackson
came
back
to
the
subject
leaving
the
decision
however
to
an
enlightened
people
and
their
representatives
moved
by
this
frank
hostility
and
anxious
for
the
future
the
bank
applied
to
congress
for
a
renewal
of
its
charter
in
four
years
before
the
expiration
of
its
life
clay
with
his
eye
upon
the
presidency
and
an
issue
for
the
campaign
warmly
supported
the
application
congress
deeply
impressed
by
his
leadership
passed
the
bill
granting
the
new
charter
and
sent
the
open
defiance
to
jackson
his
response
was
an
instant
veto
the
battle
was
on
and
it
raged
with
fury
until
the
close
of
his
second
administration
ending
in
the
destruction
of
the
bank
a
disordered
currency
and
a
national
panic
in
his
veto
message
jackson
attacked
the
bank
as
unconstitutional
and
even
hinted
at
corruption
he
refused
to
assent
to
the
proposition
that
the
supreme
court
had
settled
the
question
of
constitutionality
by
the
decision
in
the
mcculloch
case
each
public
officer
he
argued
who
takes
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
swears
that
he
will
support
it
as
he
understands
it
not
as
it
is
understood
by
others
not
satisfied
with
his
veto
and
his
declaration
against
the
bank
jackson
ordered
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
withdraw
the
government
deposits
which
formed
a
large
part
of
the
institution
funds
this
action
he
followed
up
by
an
open
charge
that
the
bank
had
used
money
shamefully
to
secure
the
return
of
its
supporters
to
congress
the
senate
stung
by
this
charge
solemnly
resolved
that
jackson
had
assumed
upon
himself
authority
and
power
not
conferred
by
the
constitution
and
laws
but
in
derogation
of
both
the
effects
of
the
destruction
of
the
bank
were
widespread
when
its
charter
expired
in
banking
was
once
more
committed
to
the
control
of
the
states
the
state
legislatures
under
a
decision
rendered
by
the
supreme
court
after
the
death
of
marshall
began
to
charter
banks
under
state
ownership
and
control
with
full
power
to
issue
paper
money
this
in
spite
of
the
provision
in
the
constitution
that
states
shall
not
issue
bills
of
credit
or
make
anything
but
gold
and
silver
coin
legal
tender
in
the
payment
of
debts
once
more
the
country
was
flooded
by
paper
currency
of
uncertain
value
to
make
matters
worse
jackson
adopted
the
practice
of
depositing
huge
amounts
of
government
funds
in
these
banks
not
forgetting
to
render
favors
to
those
institutions
which
supported
him
in
politics
pet
banks
as
they
were
styled
at
the
time
in
partially
though
by
no
means
entirely
as
a
result
of
the
abolition
of
the
bank
the
country
was
plunged
into
one
of
the
most
disastrous
panics
which
it
ever
experienced
improvements
the
bank
had
presented
to
jackson
a
very
clear
problem
one
of
destruction
other
questions
were
not
so
simple
particularly
the
subject
of
federal
appropriations
in
aid
of
roads
and
other
internal
improvements
jefferson
had
strongly
favored
government
assistance
in
such
matters
but
his
administration
was
followed
by
a
reaction
both
madison
and
monroe
vetoed
acts
of
congress
appropriating
public
funds
for
public
roads
advancing
as
their
reason
the
argument
that
the
constitution
authorized
no
such
laws
jackson
puzzled
by
the
clamor
on
both
sides
followed
their
example
without
making
the
constitutional
bar
absolute
congress
he
thought
might
lawfully
build
highways
of
a
national
and
military
value
but
he
strongly
deprecated
attacks
by
local
interests
on
the
federal
treasury
triumph
of
the
executive
jackson
reëlection
in
served
to
confirm
his
opinion
that
he
was
the
chosen
leader
of
the
people
freed
and
instructed
to
ride
rough
shod
over
congress
and
even
the
courts
no
president
before
or
since
ever
entertained
in
times
of
peace
such
lofty
notions
of
executive
prerogative
the
entire
body
of
federal
employees
he
transformed
into
obedient
servants
of
his
wishes
a
sign
or
a
nod
from
him
making
and
undoing
the
fortunes
of
the
humble
and
the
mighty
his
lawful
cabinet
of
advisers
filling
all
of
the
high
posts
in
the
government
he
treated
with
scant
courtesy
preferring
rather
to
secure
his
counsel
and
advice
from
an
unofficial
body
of
friends
and
dependents
who
owing
to
their
secret
methods
and
back
stairs
arrangements
became
known
as
the
kitchen
cabinet
under
the
leadership
of
a
silent
astute
and
resourceful
politician
amos
kendall
this
informal
gathering
of
the
faithful
both
gave
and
carried
out
decrees
and
orders
communicating
the
president
lightest
wish
or
strictest
command
to
the
uttermost
part
of
the
country
resolutely
and
in
the
face
of
bitter
opposition
jackson
had
removed
the
deposits
from
the
united
states
bank
when
the
senate
protested
against
this
arbitrary
conduct
he
did
not
rest
until
it
was
forced
to
expunge
the
resolution
of
condemnation
in
time
one
of
his
lieutenants
with
his
own
hands
was
able
to
tear
the
censure
from
the
records
when
chief
justice
marshall
issued
a
decree
against
georgia
which
did
not
suit
him
jackson
according
to
tradition
blurted
out
that
marshall
could
go
ahead
and
enforce
his
own
orders
to
the
end
he
pursued
his
willful
way
finally
even
choosing
his
own
successor
the
rise
of
the
whigs
measures
arouse
measures
so
decided
policies
so
radical
and
conduct
so
could
not
fail
to
arouse
against
jackson
a
deep
and
exasperated
opposition
the
truth
is
the
conduct
of
his
entire
administration
profoundly
disturbed
the
business
and
finances
of
the
country
it
was
accompanied
by
conditions
similar
to
those
which
existed
under
the
articles
of
confederation
a
paper
currency
almost
as
unstable
and
irritating
as
the
worthless
notes
of
revolutionary
days
flooded
the
country
hindering
the
easy
transaction
of
business
the
use
of
federal
funds
for
internal
improvements
so
vital
to
the
exchange
of
commodities
which
is
the
very
life
of
industry
was
blocked
by
executive
vetoes
the
supreme
court
which
under
marshall
had
held
refractory
states
to
their
obligations
under
the
constitution
was
flouted

judges
deliberately
selected
by
jackson
for
the
bench
began
to
sap
and
undermine
the
rulings
of

the
protective

under
which
the
textile
industry
of
new
england
the
iron
mills
of
pennsylvania
and
the
wool
flax
and
hemp
farms
of
the
west
had
flourished
had
received
a
severe
blow
in

to

clay
a
son
of
kentucky
rather
than
to
daniel

of
massachusetts
like
jackson
clay
was
born
in
a
home
haunted
by
poverty
left
fatherless
early
and
thrown
upon
his
own
resources
he
went
from
virginia
into
kentucky
where
by
sheer
force
of
intellect
he
rose
to
eminence
in
the
profession
of
law
without
the
martial
gifts
or
the
martial
spirit
of
jackson
he
slipped
more
easily
into
the
social
habits
of
the
east
at
the
same
time
that
he
retained
his
hold
on
the
affections
of
the
boisterous
west
farmers
of
ohio
indiana
and
kentucky
loved
him
financiers
of
new
york
and

trusted
him
he
was
thus
a
leader
well
fitted
to
gather
the
forces
of
opposition
into

against

around
clay

assembled
a
motley
collection
representing

species

yoked
with
nationalists
of

school
ardent
protectionists
were
bound
together
with
equally
ardent
free
traders
all
fraternizing
in
one
grand
confusion
of
ideas
under
the
title
of
national
republicans
thus
the
ancient
and
honorable
term
selected
by
jefferson
and
his
party
now
abandoned
by
jacksonian
democracy
was
adroitly
adopted
to
cover
the
supporters
of
clay
the
platform
of
the
party
however
embraced
all
the
old
federalist
principles
protection
for
american
industry
internal
improvements
respect
for
the
supreme
court
resistance
to
executive
tyranny
and
denunciation
of
the
spoils
system
though
jackson
was
easily
victorious
in
the
popular
vote
cast
for
clay
should
have
given
him
some
doubts
about
the
faith
of
the
whole
people
in
the
wisdom
of
his
reign
buren
and
the
panic
of
nothing
could
shake
the
superb
confidence
at
the
end
of
his
second
term
he
insisted
on
selecting
his
own
successor
at
a
national
convention
chosen
by
party
voters
but
packed
with
his
office
holders
and
friends
he
nominated
martin
van
buren
of
new
york
once
more
he
proved
his
strength
by
carrying
the
country
for
the
democrats
with
a
fine
flourish
he
attended
the
inauguration
of
van
buren
and
then
retired
amid
the
applause
and
tears
of
his
devotees
to
the
hermitage

home
in

fortunately
for
him
jackson
escaped
the
odium
of
a
disastrous
panic
which
struck
the
country
with
terrible
force
in
the
following
summer
among
the
contributory
causes
of
this
crisis
no
doubt
were
the
destruction
of
the
bank
and
the
issuance
of
the
specie
circular
of
which
required
the
purchasers
of
public
lands
to
pay
for
them
in
coin
instead
of
the
paper
notes
of
state
banks
whatever
the
dominating
cause
the
ruin
was
widespread
bank
after
bank
went
under
boom
towns
in
the
west
collapsed
eastern
mills
shut
down
and
working
people
in
the
industrial
centers
starving
from
unemployment
begged
for
relief
van
buren
braved
the
storm
offering
no
measure
of
reform
or
assistance
to
the
distracted
people
he
did
seek
security
for
government
funds
by
suggesting
the
removal
of
deposits
from
private
banks
and
the
establishment
of
an
independent
treasury
system
with
government
depositaries
for
public
funds
in
several
leading
cities
this
plan
was
finally
accepted
by
congress
in
had
van
buren
been
a
captivating
figure
he
might
have
lived
down
the
discredit
of
the
panic
unjustly
laid
at
his
door
but
he
was
far
from
being
a
favorite
with
the
populace
though
a
man
of
many
talents
he
owed
his
position
to
the
quiet
and
adept
management
of
jackson
rather
than
to
his
own
personal
qualities
the
men
of
the
frontier
did
not
care
for
him
they
suspected
that
he
ate
from
gold
plate
and
they
could
not
forgive
him
for
being
an
astute
politician
from
new
york
still
the
democratic
party
remembering
jackson
wishes
renominated
him
unanimously
in
and
saw
him
go
down
to
utter
defeat
whigs
and
general
by
this
time
the
national
republicans
now
known
as
whigs
a
title
taken
from
the
party
of
opposition
to
the
crown
in
england
had
learned
many
lessons
taking
a
leaf
out
of
the
democratic
book
they
nominated
not
clay
of
kentucky
well
known
for
his
views
on
the
bank
the
tariff
and
internal
improvements
but
a
military
hero
general
william
henry
harrison
a
man
of
uncertain
political
opinions
harrison
a
son
of
a
virginia
signer
of
the
declaration
of
independence
sprang
into
public
view
by
winning
a
battle
more
famous
than
important
tippecanoe
a
brush
with
the
indians
in
indiana
he
added
to
his
laurels
by
rendering
praiseworthy
services
during
the
war
of
when
days
of
peace
returned
he
was
rewarded
by
a
grateful
people
with
a
seat
in
congress
then
he
retired
to
quiet
life
in
a
little
village
near
cincinnati
like
jackson
he
was
held
to
be
a
son
of
the
south
and
the
west
like
jackson
he
was
a
military
hero
a
lesser
light
but
still
a
light
like
old
hickory
he
rode
into
office
on
a
tide
of
popular
feeling
against
an
eastern
man
accused
of
being
something
of
an
aristocrat
his
personal
popularity
was
sufficient
the
whigs
who
nominated
him
shrewdly
refused
to
adopt
a
platform
or
declare
their
belief
in
anything
when
some
democrat
asserted
that
harrison
was
a
backwoodsman
whose
sole
wants
were
a
jug
of
hard
cider
and
a
log
cabin
the
whigs
treated
the
remark
not
as
an
insult
but
as
proof
positive
that
harrison
deserved
the
votes
of
jackson
men
the
jug
and
the
cabin
they
proudly
transformed
into
symbols
of
the
campaign
and
won
for
their
chieftain
electoral
votes
while
van
buren
got
only
sixty
and
the
hero
of
tippecanoe
was
not
long
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
victory
the
hungry
horde
of
whig
office
seekers
descended
upon
him
like
wolves
upon
the
fold
if
he
went
out
they
waylaid
him
if
he
stayed
indoors
he
was
besieged
not
even
his
bed
chamber
was
spared
he
was
none
too
strong
at
best
and
he
took
a
deep
cold
on
the
day
of
his
inauguration
between
driving
out
democrats
and
appeasing
whigs
he
fell
mortally
before
the
end
of
a
month
he
lay
dead
at
the
capitol
harrison
successor
john
tyler
the
vice
president
whom
the
whigs
had
nominated
to
catch
votes
in
virginia
was
more
of
a
democrat
than
anything
else
though
he
was
not
partisan
enough
to
please
anybody
the
whigs
railed
at
him
because
he
would
not
approve
the
founding
of
another
united
states
bank
the
democrats
stormed
at
him
for
refusing
until
near
the
end
of
his
term
to
sanction
the
annexation
of
texas
which
had
declared
its
independence
of
mexico
in
his
entire
administration
marked
by
unseemly
wrangling
produced
only
two
measures
of
importance
the
whigs
flushed
by
victory
with
the
aid
of
a
few
protectionist
democrats
enacted
in
a
new
tariff
law
destroying
the
compromise
which
had
brought
about
the
truce
between
the
north
and
the
south
in
the
days
of
nullification
the
distinguished
leader
of
the
whigs
daniel
webster
as
secretary
of
state
in
negotiation
with
lord
ashburton
representing
great
britain
settled
the
dispute
between
the
two
countries
over
the
maine
boundary
a
year
after
closing
this
chapter
in
american
diplomacy
webster
withdrew
to
private
life
leaving
the
president
to
endure
alone
the
buffets
of
political
fortune
to
the
end
the
whigs
regarded
tyler
as
a
traitor
to
their
cause
but
the
judgment
of
history
is
that
it
was
a
case
of
the
biter
bitten
they
had
nominated
him
for
the
vice
presidency
as
a
man
of
views
acceptable
to
southern
democrats
in
order
to
catch
their
votes
little
reckoning
with
the
chances
of
his
becoming
president
tyler
had
not
deceived
them
and
thoroughly
soured
he
left
the
white
house
in
not
to
appear
in
public
life
again
until
the
days
of
secession
when
he
espoused
the
southern
confederacy
jacksonian
democracy
with
new
leadership
serving
a
new
cause
slavery
was
returned
to
power
under
james
polk
a
friend
of
the
general
from
tennessee
a
few
grains
of
sand
were
to
run
through
the
hour
glass
before
the
whig
party
was
to
be
broken
and
scattered
as
the
federalists
had
been
more
than
a
generation
before
the
interaction
of
american
and
european
opinion
in
england
and
during
the
period
of
jacksonian
democracy
as
in
all
epochs
of
ferment
there
was
a
close
relation
between
the
thought
of
the
new
world
and
the
old
in
england
the
successes
of
the
american
experiment
were
used
as
arguments
in
favor
of
overthrowing
the
aristocracy
which
george
iii
had
manipulated
with
such
effect
against
america
half
a
century
before
in
the
united
states
on
the
other
hand
conservatives
like
chancellor
kent
the
stout
opponent
of
manhood
suffrage
in
new
york
cited
the
riots
of
the
british
working
classes
as
a
warning
against
admitting
the
same
classes
to
a
share
in
the
government
of
the
united
states
along
with
the
agitation
of
opinion
went
events
in
the
year
of
jackson
second
triumph
the
british
parliament
passed
its
first
reform
bill
which
conferred
the
ballot
not
on
workingmen
as
yet
but
on
mill
owners
and
shopkeepers
whom
the
landlords
regarded
with
genuine
horror
the
initial
step
was
thus
taken
in
breaking
down
the
privileges
of
the
landed
aristocracy
and
the
rich
merchants
of
england
about
the
same
time
a
popular
revolution
occurred

the
bourbon
family
restored
to
the
throne
of
france
by
the
allied
powers
after
their
victory
over
napoleon

embarked
upon
a
policy
of
arbitrary
government

use
the
familiar
phrase
they
had
learned
nothing
and
forgotten

his
policy
encountered
equally
zealous

in

was
overthrown
the

under
the

established
not

as
some
of
the
radicals

hoped
but
a
liberal

philippe
this
second
french
revolution
made
a
profound
impression
on
americans
convincing
them
that
the
whole

was
moving

the

either
a

conservatives
viewed
it
with
anxiety

with

leaders
could
see
that
the
tide
of

was
rising
all
over
the

and
could
not

naturally
the
country
that
had
advanced

was
the
place
in
which
to
find
arguments

against

character
tocqueville
in
in
addition
to
the
casual
traveler
there
began
to
visit
the
united
states
the
thoughtful
observer
bent
on
finding
out
what
manner
of
nation
this
was
springing
up
in
the
wilderness
those
who
looked
with
sympathy
upon
the
growing
popular
forces
of
england
and
france
found
in
the
united
states
in
spite
of
many
blemishes
and
defects
a
guarantee
for
the
future
of
the
rule
in
the
old
world
one
of
these
alexis
de
tocqueville
a
french
liberal
of
mildly
democratic
sympathies
made
a
journey
to
this
country
in
he
described
in
a
very
remarkable
volume
in
the
grand
experiment
as
he
saw
it
on
the
whole
he
was
convinced
after
examining
with
a
critical
eye
the
life
and
labor
of
the
american
people
as
well
as
the
constitutions
of
the
states
and
the
nation
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
democracy
with
all
its
faults
was
both
inevitable
and
successful
slavery
he
thought
was
a
painful
contrast
to
the
other
features
of
american
life
and
he
foresaw
what
proved
to
be
the
irrepressible
conflict
over
it
he
believed
that
through
blundering
the
people
were
destined
to
learn
the
highest
of
all
arts
on
a
grand
scale
the
absence
of
a
leisure
class
devoted
to
no
calling
or
profession
merely
enjoying
the
refinements
of
life
and
adding
to
its
graces
the
flaw
in
american
culture
that
gave
deep
distress
to
many
a
european
leader
de
tocqueville
thought
a
necessary
virtue
in
the
republic
amongst
a
democratic
people
where
there
is
no
hereditary
wealth
every
man
works
to
earn
a
living
or
has
worked
or
is
born
of
parents
who
have
worked
a
notion
of
labor
is
therefore
presented
to
the
mind
on
every
side
as
the
necessary
natural
and
honest
condition
of
human
existence
it
was
this
notion
of
a
government
in
the
hands
of
people
who
labored
that
struck
the
french
publicist
as
the
most
significant
fact
in
the
modern
world
martineau
visit
to
this
phase
of
american
life
also
profoundly
impressed
the
brilliant
english
writer
harriet
martineau
she
saw
all
parts
of
the
country
the
homes
of
the
rich
and
the
log
cabins
of
the
frontier
she
traveled
in
stagecoaches
canal
boats
and
on
horseback
and
visited
sessions
of
congress
and
auctions
at
slave
markets
she
tried
to
view
the
country
impartially
and
the
thing
that
left
the
deepest
mark
on
her
mind
was
the
solidarity
of
the
people
in
one
great
political
body
however
various
may
be
the
tribes
of
inhabitants
in
those
states
whatever
part
of
the
world
may
have
been
their
birthplace
or
that
of
their
fathers
however
broken
may
be
their
language
however
servile
or
noble
their
employments
however
exalted
or
despised
their
state
all
are
declared
to
be
bound
together
by
equal
political
obligations
in
that
country
all
are
held
to
have
an
equal
interest
in
the
principles
of
its
institutions
and
to
be
bound
in
equal
duty
to
watch
their
workings
miss
martineau
was
also
impressed
with
the
passion
of
americans
for
land
ownership
and
contrasted
the
united
states
favorably
with
england
where
the
tillers
of
the
soil
were
either
tenants
or
laborers
for
wages
by
no
means
all
observers
and
writers
were
convinced
that
america
was
a
success
the
fastidious
traveler
trollope
who
thought
the
english
system
of
church
and
state
was
ideal
saw
in
the
united
states
only
roughness
and
ignorance
she
lamented
the
total
and
universal
want
of
manners
both
in
males
and
females
adding
that
while
they
appear
to
have
clear
heads
and
active
intellects
there
was
no
charm
no
grace
in
their
conversation
she
found
everywhere
a
lack
of
reverence
for
kings
learning
and
rank
other
critics
were
even
more
savage
the
editor
of
the
petulantly
exclaimed
that
the
united
states
was
a
brigand
confederation
charles
dickens
declared
the
country
to
be
so
maimed
and
lame
so
full
of
sores
and
ulcers
that
her
best
friends
turn
from

men
his
prophecy
did
not
seem
far
wrong
but
before
the
lapse
of
half
that
time
there
appeared
beyond
the
mississippi
a
tier
of
new
states
reaching
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
the
southern
boundary
of
minnesota
and
a
new
commonwealth
on
the
pacific
ocean
where
american
emigrants
had
raised
the
bear
flag
of
california
the
advance
of
the
middle
border
when
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
had
been
reached
the
mississippi
river
which
daniel
boone
the
intrepid
hunter
had
crossed
during
washington
administration
to
escape
from
civilization
in
kentucky
had
become
the
waterway
for
a
vast
empire
the
center
of
population
of
the
united
states
had
passed
to
the
ohio
valley
missouri
with
its
wide
reaches
of
rich
lands
level
and
fertile
well
adapted
to
hemp
raising
had
drawn
to
its
borders
thousands
of
planters
from
the
old
southern
states
from
virginia
and
the
carolinas
as
well
as
from
kentucky
and
tennessee
when
the
great
compromise
of
admitted
her
to
the
union
wearing
every
jewel
of
sovereignty
as
a
florid
orator
announced
migratory
slave
owners
were
assured
that
their

would
be
safe
in
missouri
along
the
western
shore
of
the
mississippi
and
on
both
banks
of
the
missouri
to
the
uttermost
limits
of
the
state
plantations
tilled
by
bondmen
spread
out
in
broad
expanses
in
the
neighborhood
of
jefferson
city
the
slaves
numbered
more
than
a
fourth
of
the
population
into
this
stream
of
migration
from
the
planting
south
flowed
another
current
of
farmers
some
from
kentucky
tennessee
and
mississippi
driven
out
by
the
onrush
of
the
planters
buying
and
consolidating
small
farms
into
vast
estates
and
still
more
from
the
east
and
the
old
world
to
the
northwest
over
against
iowa
and
to
the
southwest
against
arkansas
these
yeomen
laid
out
farms
to
be
tilled
by
their
own
labor
in
those
regions
the
number
of
slaves
seldom
rose
above
five
or
six
per
cent
of
the
population
the
old
french
post
louis
enriched
by
the
fur
trade
of
the
far
west
and
the
steamboat
traffic
of
the
river
grew
into
a
thriving
commercial
city
including
among
its
thousand
inhabitants
in
nearly
forty
thousand
foreigners
german
immigrants
from
pennsylvania
and
europe
being
the
largest
single
element
below
missouri
lay
the
territory
of
arkansas
which
had
long
been
the
paradise
of
the
swarthy
hunter
and
the
restless
frontiersman
fleeing
from
the
advancing
borders
of
farm
and
town
in
search
of
the
life
wild
and
free
where
the
rifle
supplied
the
game
and
a
few
acres
of
ground
the
corn
and
potatoes
they
had
filtered
into
the
territory
in
an
unending
drift
squatting
on
the
land
without
so
much
as
asking
the
leave
of
any
government
territorial
or
national
they
claimed
as
their
own
the
soil
on
which
they
first
planted
their
feet
like
the
cherokee
indians
whom
they
had
as
neighbors
whose
very
customs
and
dress
they
sometimes
adopted
the
squatters
spent
their
days
in
the
midst
of
rough
plenty
beset
by
chills
fevers
and
the
ills
of
the
flesh
but
for
many
years
unvexed
by
political
troubles
or
the
restrictions
of
civilized
life
unfortunately
for
them
however
the
fertile
valleys
of
the
mississippi
and
arkansas
were
well
adapted
to
the
cultivation
of
cotton
and
tobacco
and
their
sylvan
peace
was
soon
broken
by
an
invasion
of
planters
the
newcomers
with
their
servile
workers
spread
upward
in
the
valley
toward
missouri
and
along
the
southern
border
westward
to
the
red
river
in
time
the
slaves
in
the
tier
of
counties
against
louisiana
ranged
from
thirty
to
seventy
per
cent
of
the
population
this
marked
the
doom
of
the
small
farmer
swept
arkansas
into
the
main
current
of
planting
politics
and
led
to
a
powerful
lobby
at
washington
in
favor
of
admission
to
the
union
a
boon
granted
in
in
accordance
with
a
custom
a
free
state
was
admitted
to
the
union
to
balance
a
slave
state
in
the
people
of
michigan
a
territory
ten
times
the
size
of
connecticut
announced
that
the
time
had
come
for
them
to
enjoy
the
privileges
of
a
commonwealth
all
along
the
southern
border
the
land
had
been
occupied
largely
by
pioneers
from
new
england
who
built
prim
farmhouses
and
adopted
the
plan
of
after
the
fashion
of
the
old
home
the
famous
post
of
detroit
was
growing
into
a
flourishing
city
as
the
boats
plying
on
the
great
lakes
carried
travelers
settlers
and
freight
through
the
narrows
in
all
according
to
the
census
there
were
more
than
ninety
thousand
inhabitants
in
the
territory
so
it
was
not
without
warrant
that
they
clamored
for
statehood
congress
busy
as
ever
with
politics
delayed
and
the
inhabitants
of
michigan
unable
to
restrain
their
impatience
called
a
convention
drew
up
a
constitution
and
started
a
lively
quarrel
with
ohio
over
the
southern
boundary
the
hand
of
congress
was
now
forced
objections
were
made
to
the
new
constitution
on
the
ground
that
it
gave
the
ballot
to
all
free
white
males
including
aliens
not
yet
naturalized
but
the
protests
were
overborne
in
a
long
debate
the
boundary
was
fixed
and
michigan
though
shorn
of
some
of
the
land
she
claimed
came
into
the
union
in
across
lake
michigan
to
the
west
lay
the
territory
of
wisconsin
which
shared
with
michigan
the
interesting
history
of
the
northwest
running
back
into
the
heroic
days
when
french
hunters
and
missionaries
were
planning
a
french
empire
for
the
great
monarch
louis
xiv
it
will
not
be
forgotten
that
the
french
rangers
of
the
woods
the
priests
prepared
for
sacrifice
even
to
death
the
trappers
of
the
french
agencies
and
the
french
explorers
marquette
joliet
and
menard
were
the
first
white
men
to
paddle
their
frail
barks
through
the
northern
waters
they
first
blazed
their
trails
into
the
black
forests
and
left
traces
of
their
work
in
the
names
of
portages
and
little
villages
it
was
from
these
forests
that
red
men
in
full
war
paint
journeyed
far
to
fight
under
the
of
france
when
the
soldiers
of
king
louis
made
their
last
stand
at
quebec
and
montreal
against
the
imperial
arms
of
britain
it
was
here
that
the
british
flag
was
planted
in
and
that
the
great
pontiac
conspiracy
was
formed
two
years
later
to
overthrow
british
dominion
when
a
generation
afterward
the
stars
and
stripes
supplanted
the
union
jack
the
french
were
still
almost
the
only
white
men
in
the
region
they
were
soon
joined
by
hustling
yankee
fur
traders
who
did
battle
royal
against
british
interlopers
the
traders
cut
their
way
through
forest
trails
and
laid
out
the
routes
through
lake
and
stream
and
over
portages
for
the
settlers
and
their
families
from
the
states
back
east
it
was
the
forest
ranger
who
discovered
the
water
power
later
used
to
turn
the
busy
mills
grinding
the
grain
from
the
spreading
farm
lands
in
the
wake
of
the
fur
hunters
forest
men
and
farmers
came
miners
from
kentucky
tennessee
and
missouri
crowding
in
to
exploit
the
lead

of

northwest
some
of
them
bringing

to

their
claims
had
it
not
been
for
the
gold
fever
of
that
drew
the
wielders
of
pick
and

to
the
far

wisconsin
would
early
have
taken
high
rank
among
the
mining
regions
of
the

michigan
the
village

twenty
thousand

wisconsin
to
the

already
the
germans
irish
and
scandinavians
had
found
their
way
into
the
territory
they
joined
americans
from
the
older
states
in
clearing
forests
building
roads
transforming
trails
into
highways
erecting
mills
and
connecting
streams
with
canals
to
make
a
network
of
routes
for
the
traffic
that
poured
to
and
from
the
great
lakes
and
to
the
southwest
of
wisconsin
beyond

mississippi
where
the
tall
grass
of
the
prairies
waved
like
the

farmers
from

northward
for
freemen
unaccustomed
to

and
slave
markets
preferred
the
open
country
above
the
compromise
line
with
incredible
swiftness
they
spread
farms
westward
from
the
mississippi
with
yankee
ingenuity
they
turned
to
trading
on
the
river
building
before
three
prosperous
centers
of
traffic
dubuque
davenport
and
burlington
true
to
their
old
traditions
they
founded
colleges
and
academies
that
religion
and
learning
might
be
cherished
on
the

first
revealed
by
the

by

was
a
certain
monotony
about
pioneering
in

and
on
the
middle
border
as
the
long
stretches
of
land
were
cleared
or
prepared
for

they
were
laid
out
like
checkerboards
into
squares

there
was
a
striking
uniformity
also
about
the
endless
succession
of
fertile
fields
spreading
far

wide
under
the
hot
summer
sun
no
majestic

relieved
the
sweep
of

were
there
to

the

fitted
on
the

with

even
the

happiness

presented
such

foresee
the
unifying

its

what

indeed
the

signs
of
an
ancient
civilization
fragments
of

ruined

broken

which
told
of
once
prosperous
peoples
who
by
art

had
conquered
the
aridity
of
the
desert
and
lifted
themselves
in
the
scale
of
culture
above
the

the
settlers
of
this
vast
empire
were
to
be
as
diverse
in
their

as
those

of

some
were
to
make
their

passion
for
the
accorded
to
states
as
soon
as
a
few
thousand
settlers
came
together
in
a
single
territory
there
arose
a
mighty
shout
for
a
position
beside
the
staid
commonwealths
of
the
east
and
the
south
statehood
meant
to
the
pioneers
dignity
and
the
right
to
dispose
of
land
minerals
and
timber
in
their
own
way
in
the
quest
for
this
local
autonomy
there
arose
many
a
wordy
contest
in
congress
each
of
the
political
parties
lending
a
helping
hand
in
the
admission
of
a
state
when
it
gave
promise
of
adding
new
congressmen
of
the
right
political
persuasion
to
use
the
current
phrase
planters
and
while
the
farmers
of
the
north
found
the
broad
acres
of
the
western
prairies
stretching
on
before
them
apparently
in
endless
expanse
it
was
far
different
with
the
southern
planters
ever
active
in
their
search
for
new
fields
as
they
exhausted
the
virgin
soil
of
the
older
states
the
restless
subjects
of
king
cotton
quickly
reached
the
frontier
of
louisiana
there
they
paused
but
only
for
a
moment
the
fertile
land
of
texas
just
across
the
boundary
lured
them
on
and
the
mexican
republic
to
which
it
belonged
extended
to
them
a
more
than
generous
welcome
little
realizing
the
perils
lurking
in
a
peaceful
penetration
the
authorities
at
mexico
city
opened
wide
the
doors
and
made
large

of

to
american

unaccustomed
to
such

and
thoroughly
frightened
by
its
extent
drew
back
in
dismay
its
fears
were
increased
as
quarrels
broke
out
between
the
americans
and
the
natives
in

fear
grew
into
consternation
when
efforts
were
made
by

mexico
then
sought

it
stopped

schemes
canceled
many
of

put
a

these

numbering
only
about

in

they
raised
the
standard
of

in

summoned
a
convention
following
in
the
footsteps
of
their

they
issued
a
declaration
of

signed
mainly
by

from
the

anticipating
that
the

would
not
quietly
accept
their

as

they

repel

the

a

houston
at
the

sought
admission
to
the

this
seemed
at
first
an
easy
matter
all
that
was
required
to
bring
it
about
appeared
to
be
a
treaty
annexing
texas
to

at
the
height

a

approved
the
transaction
through
an

in

jackson
had
long
and
anxiously
labored
by
means
none
too
nice
to
wring
from
the
mexican
republic
the
cession
of
the
coveted
territory
when
the
texans
took
matters
into

naturally
resulted
the

instead
of

from

the
californians
held
a
convention
in

framed
their

with
impatience
the
delegates
brushed
aside
the
plea
that
the
balance
of
power
between
the
north
and
south
required
the
admission
of
their
state
as
a
slave
commonwealth
without
a
dissenting
voice
they
voted
in
favor
of
freedom
and
boldly
made
their
request
for

among
the

though
a
southern

advised
congress
to

the

henry

came
to

on

to

in
the
midst
of
forbidding
and
barren
wastes
a
religious
sect
the
mormons
had
planted
a
colony
destined
to
a
stormy
career
founded
in
under
the
leadership
of
joseph
smith
of
new
york
the
sect
had
suffered
from
many
cruel
buffets
of
fortune
from
ohio
they
had
migrated
into
missouri
where
they
were
set
upon
and
beaten
some
of
them
were
murdered
by
indignant
neighbors
harried
out
of
missouri
they
went
into
illinois
only
to
see
their
director
and
prophet
smith
first
imprisoned
by
the
authorities
and
then
shot
by
a
mob
having
raised
up
a
cloud
of
enemies
on
account
of
both
their
religious
faith
and
their
practice
of
allowing
a
man
to
have
more
than
one
wife
they
fell
in
heartily
with
the
suggestion
of
a
new
leader
brigham
young
that
they
go
into
the
far
west
beyond
the
plains
of
kansas
into
the
forlorn
desert
where
the
wicked
would
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
could
be
at
rest
as
they
read
in
the
bible
in
young
with
a
company
of
picked
men
searched
far
and
wide
until
he
found
a
suitable
spot
overlooking
the
salt
lake
valley
returning
to
illinois
he
gathered
up
his
followers
now
numbering
several
thousand
and
in
one
mighty
wagon
caravan
they
all
went
to
their
distant
haven

in
brigham
young
the
mormons
had
a
leader
of
remarkable
power
who
gave
direction
to
the
redemption
of
the
arid
soil
the
management
of
property
and
the
upbuilding
of
industry
he
promised
them
to
make
the
desert
blossom
as
the
rose
and
verily
he
did
it
he
firmly
shaped
the
enterprise
of
the
colony
along
lines
holding
down
the
speculator
and
profiteer
with
one
hand
and
giving
encouragement
to
the
industrious
poor

shrewdness
befitting

he
knew
how
to
draw
the
line
between

and

land
was
given
outright
to
each
family
but
great
care
was
exercised
in
the
distribution
so
that
none
should
have
great
advantage
over
another
the
purchase
of
supplies
and
the
sale
of

were
carried
on
through
a

the
common
good

for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of

the
problem
of

the
mormons
surmounted
the
most
perplexing
obstacles
with
astounding
skill
they
built
irrigation
works
by
coöperative
labor
and
granted
water
rights
to
all
families
on
equitable

long
remained

eager
to
be

efforts
also
to

there
were

in

rousing
the
martial
ardor
of

the

now

not
fail
to
bring
in
its

consequences
of
a
striking
character
some
were
immediate
and
obvious
others
require
a
fullness
of
time
not
yet
reached
to
reveal
their
complete
significance
outstanding
among
them
was
the
growth
of
an
industrial
population
detached
from
the
land
concentrated
in
cities
and
to
use
jefferson
phrase
dependent
upon
the
caprices
and
casualties
of
trade
for
a
livelihood
this
was
a
result
as
the
great
virginian
had
foreseen
which
flowed
inevitably
from
public
and
private
efforts
to
stimulate
industry
as
against

illustration
lowell
massachusetts
in
an
early
industrial
town
it
was
estimated
in
on
the
basis
of
the
census
figures
that
mechanical
production
gave
employment
to
men
and
women
making
if
the
average
number
of
dependents
upon
them
be
reckoned
nearly
six
million
people
or
about
of
the
population
of
the
country
sustained
from
manufactures
this
runs
the
official
record
was
exclusive
of
the
number
engaged
in
the
production
of
many
of
the
raw
materials
and
of
the
food
for
manufacturers
in
the
distribution
of
their
products
such
as
merchants
clerks
draymen
mariners
the
employees
of
railroads
expresses
and
steamboats
of
capitalists
various
artistic
and
professional
classes
as
well
as
carpenters
bricklayers
painters
and
the
members
of
other
mechanical
trades
not
classed
as
manufactures
it
is
safe
to
assume
then
that
of
the
whole
population
is
supported
directly
or
indirectly
by
manufacturing
industry
taking
however
the
number
of
persons
directly
supported
by
manufactures
namely
about
six
millions
reveals
the
astounding
fact
that
the
white
laboring
population
divorced
from
the
soil
already
exceeded
the
number
of
slaves
on
southern
farms
and
plantations
the
more
carefully
the
rapid
growth
of
the
industrial
population
is
examined
the
more
surprising
is
the
fact
that
such
an
immense
body
of
free
laborers
could
be
found
particularly
when
it
is
recalled
to
what
desperate
straits
the
colonial
leaders
were
put
in
securing
immigrants
slavery
indentured
servitude
and
kidnapping
being
the
fruits
of
their
necessities
the
answer
to
the
enigma
is
to
be
found
partly
in
european
conditions
and
partly
in
the
cheapness
of
transportation
after
the
opening
of
the
era
of
steam
navigation
shrewd
observers
of
the
course
of
events
had
long
foreseen
that
a
flood
of
cheap
labor
was
bound
to
come
when
the
way
was
made
easy
some
among
them
chief
justice
ellsworth
went
so
far
as
to
prophesy
that
white
labor
would
in
time
be
so
abundant
that
slavery
would
disappear
as
the
more
costly
of
the
two
labor
systems
the
processes
of
nature
were
aided
by
the
policies
of

power

before

of

the

of

organized

a
strike
in
and
held
together
until
indicted
seven
years
later
for
conspiracy
during
the
twenties
and
thirties
local
labor
unions
sprang
up
in
all
industrial
centers
and
they
led
almost
immediately
to
city
federations
of
the
several
crafts
as
the
thousands
who
were
dependent
upon
their
daily
labor
for
their
livelihood
mounted
into
the
millions
and

spread
across

the
local

of

grew
into
national
craft
organizations
bound
together
by
the

and

before
there
were

an
attempt
was

made
in
to

all

into

but
it
perished
within
three

through
lack

half
a
century
had
to
elapse
before
the
american
federation
of

was
to
accomplish
this
task
all
the

at

by
the

was

strikes
a
labor
press
a
labor
political
program
and
a

in
every
great

industrial
disputes
were
a
common
occurrence
the
papers
recorded
about
four
hundred
in
two
years
local
affairs
but
forecasting
economic
struggles
in
a
larger
field
the
labor
press
seems
to
have
begun
with
the
founding
of
the
free
in
philadelphia
in
and
the
establishment
of
the
new
york
shortly
afterward
these
papers
were
in
later
years
followed
by
regular
trade
papers
designed
to
weld
together
and
advance
the
interests
of
particular
crafts
edited
by
able
leaders
these
little
sheets
with
limited
circulation
wielded
an
enormous
influence
in
the
ranks
of
the
workers
and
as
for
the
political
program
of
labor
the
main
planks
were
clear
and
specific
the
abolition
of
imprisonment
for
debt
manhood
suffrage
in
states
where
property
qualifications
still
prevailed
free
and
universal
education
laws
protecting
the
safety

of
workers
in
mills
and
factories
abolition
of
lotteries
repeal
of
laws
requiring
militia
service
and
free
land
in
the
west
into
the
labor
papers
and
platforms
there
sometimes
crept
a
note
of
hostility
to
the
masters
of
industry
a
sign
of
bitterness
that
excited
little
alarm
while
cheap
land
in
the
west
was
open
to
the
discontented
the
philadelphia
workmen
in
issuing
a
call

the

of
course
for

and
there
an
extremist
went
to
the
length
of
advocating
an
equal
division
of
wealth
among
all
the
people
the
crudest
kind
of
communism
agitation
of
this
character
produced
in
labor
circles
profound
distrust
of
both
whigs
and
democrats
who
talked
principally
about

and

it
resulted
in
attempts
to
found
independent
labor
parties
in
philadelphia

new

and
new

labor
candidates
were
put
up

at

got

triumphantly
exclaimed
the

of
philadelphia
in
but
the
triumph
was
illusory
dissensions
appeared
in
the
labor
ranks
the
old
party
leaders
particularly
of
tammany
hall
the
democratic
party
organization
in
new
york
city
offered
concessions
to
labor
in
return
for
votes
newspapers
unsparingly
denounced
trade
union
politicians
as
demagogues
levellers
and
rag
tag
and
bobtail
and
some
of
them
deeming
labor
unrest
the
sour
fruit
of
manhood
suffrage
suggested
disfranchisement
as
a
remedy
under
the
influence
of
concessions
and
attacks
the
political
fever
quickly
died
away
and
the
end
of
the
decade
left
no
remnant
of
the
labor
political
parties
labor
leaders
turned
to
a
task
which
seemed
more
substantial
and
practical
that
of
organizing
workingmen
into
craft
unions
for
the
definite
purpose
of
raising
wages
and
reducing
hours
the
industrial
revolution
and
national
politics
plans
for
union
with
the
it
was
long
the
design
of
southern
statesmen
like
calhoun
to
hold
the
west
and
the
south
together
in
one
political
party
the
theory
on
which
they
based
their
hope
was
simple
both
sections
were
agricultural
the
producers
of
raw
materials
and
the
buyers
of
manufactured
goods
the
planters
were
heavy
purchasers
of
western
bacon
pork
mules
and
grain
the
mississippi
river
and
its
tributaries
formed
the
natural
channel
for
the
transportation
of
heavy
produce
southward
to
the
plantations
and
outward
to
europe
therefore
ran
their
political
reasoning
the
interests
of
the
two
sections
were
one
by
standing
together
in
favor
of
low
tariffs
they
could
buy
their
manufactures
cheaply
in
europe
and
pay
for
them
in
cotton
tobacco
and
grain
the
union
of
the
two
sections
under
jackson
management
seemed
perfect
east
forms
ties
with
the
eastern
leaders
were
not
blind
to
the
ambitions
of
southern
statesmen
on
the
contrary
they
also
recognized
the
importance
of
forming
strong
ties
with
the
agrarian
west
and
drawing
the
produce
of
the
ohio
valley
to
philadelphia
and
new
york
the
canals
and
railways
were
the
physical
signs
of
this
economic
union
and
the
results
commercial
and
political
were
soon
evident
by
the
middle
of
the
century
southern
economists
noted
the
change
one
of
them
de
bow
lamenting
that
the
great
cities
of
the
north
have
severally
penetrated
the
interior
with
artificial
lines
until
they
have
taken
from
the
open
and
untaxed
current
of
the
mississippi
the
commerce
produced
on
its
borders
to
this
writer
it
was
an
astounding
thing
to
behold
the
number
of
steamers
that
now
descend
the
upper
mississippi
river
loaded
to
the
guards
with
produce
as
far
as
the
mouth
of
the
illinois
river
and
then
turn
up
that
stream
with
their
cargoes
to
be
shipped
to
new
york
chicago
the
illinois
canal
has
not
only
swept
the
whole
produce
along
the
line
of
the
illinois
river
to
the
east
but
it
is
drawing
the
products
of
the
upper
mississippi
through
the
same
channel
thus
depriving
new
orleans
and
louis
of
a
rich
portion
of
their
former
trade
if
to
any
shippers
the
broad
current
of
the
great
river
sweeping
down
to
new
orleans
offered
easier
means
of
physical
communication
to
the
sea
than
the
canals
and
railways
the
difference
could
be
overcome
by
the
credit
which
eastern
bankers
were
able
to
extend
to
the
grain
and
produce
buyers
in
the
first
instance
and
through
them
to
the
farmers
on
the
soil
the
acute
southern
observer
just
quoted
de
bow
admitted
with
evident
regret
in
that
last
autumn
the
rich
regions
of
ohio
indiana
and
illinois
were
flooded
with
the
local
bank
notes
of
the
eastern
states
advanced
by
the
new
york
houses
on
produce
to
be
shipped
by
way
of
the
canals
in
the
spring
these
moneyed
facilities
enable
the
packer
miller
and
speculator
to
hold
on
to
their
produce
until
the
opening
of
navigation
in
the
spring
and
they
are
no
longer
obliged
as
formerly
to
hurry
off
their
shipments
during
the
winter
by
the
way
of
new
orleans
in
order
to
realize
funds
by
drafts
on
their
shipments
the
banking
facilities
at
the
east
are
doing
as
much
to
draw
trade
from
us
as
the
canals
and
railways
which
eastern
capital
is
constructing
thus
canals
railways
and
financial
credit
were
swiftly
forging
bonds
of
union
between
the
old
home
of
jacksonian
democracy
in
the
west
and
the
older
home
of
federalism
in
the
east
the
nationalism
to
which
webster
paid
eloquent
tribute
became
more
and
more
real
with
the
passing
of
time
the
of
the
pioneer
was
broken
down
as
he
began
to
watch
the
produce
markets
of
new
york
and
philadelphia
where
the
prices
of
corn
and
hogs
fixed
his
earnings
for
the
year
west
and
in
addition
to
the
commercial
bonds
between
the
east
and
the
west
there
was
growing
up
a
common
interest
in
manufactures
as
skilled
white
labor
increased
in
the
ohio
valley
the
industries
springing
up
in
the
new
cities
made
western
life
more
like
that
of
the
industrial
east
than
like
that
of
the
planting
south
moreover
the
western
states
produced
some
important
raw
materials
for
american
factories
which
called
for
protection
against
foreign
competition
notably
wool
hemp
and
flax
as
the
south
had
little
or
no
foreign
competition
in
cotton
and
tobacco
the
east
could
not
offer
protection
for
her
raw
materials
in
exchange
for
protection
for
industries
with
the
west
however
it
became
possible
to
establish
reciprocity
in
tariffs
that
is
for
example
to
trade
a
high
rate
on
wool
for
a
high
rate
on
textiles
or
iron
south
dependent
on
the
while
east
and
west
were
drawing
together
the
distinctions
between
north
and
south
were
becoming
more
marked
the
latter
having
few
industries
and
producing
little
save
raw
materials
was
being
forced
into
the
position
of
a
dependent
section
as
a
result
of
the
protective
tariff
southern
planters
were
compelled
to
turn
more
and
more
to
northern
mills
for
their
cloth
shoes
hats
hoes
plows
and
machinery
nearly
all
the
goods
which
they
bought
in
europe
in
exchange
for
their
produce
came
overseas
to
northern
ports
whence
transshipments
were
made
by
rail
and
water
to
southern
points
of
distribution
their
rice
cotton
and
tobacco
in
as
far
as
they
were
not
carried
to
europe
in
british
bottoms
were
transported
by
northern
masters
in
these
ways
a
large
part
of
the
financial
operations
connected
with
the
sale
of
southern
produce
and
the
purchase
of
goods
in
exchange
passed
into
the
hands
of
northern
merchants
and
bankers
who
naturally
made
profits
from
their
transactions
finally
southern
planters
who
wanted
to
buy
more
land
and
more
slaves
on
credit
borrowed
heavily
in
the
north
where
huge
accumulations
made
the
rates
of
interest
lower
than
the
smaller
banks
of
the
south
could
afford
south
reckons
the
cost
of
economic
as
southern
dependence
upon
northern
capital
became
more
and
more
marked
southern
leaders
began
to
chafe
at
what
they
regarded
as
restraints
laid
upon
their
enterprise
in
a
word
they
came
to
look
upon
the
planter
as
a
to
the
manufacturer
and
financier
the
south
expostulated
de
bow
stands
in
the
attitude
of
feeding
a
vast
population
of
northern
merchants
shipowners
capitalists
and
others
who
without
claims
on
her
progeny
drink
up
the
life
blood
of
her
trade
where
goes
the
value
of
our
labor
but
to
those
who
taking
advantage
of
our
folly
ship
for
us
buy
for
us
sell
to
us
and
after
turning
our
own
capital
to
their
profitable
account
return
laden
with
our
money
to
enjoy
their
easily
earned
opulence
at
home
southern
statisticians
not
satisfied
with
generalities
attempted
to
figure
out
how
great
was
this
tribute
in
dollars
and
cents
they
estimated
that
the
planters
annually
lent
to
northern
merchants
the
full
value
of
their
exports
a
hundred
millions
or
more
to
be
used
in
the
manipulation
of
foreign
imports
they
calculated
that
no
less
than
forty
millions
all
told
had
been
paid
to
shipowners
in
profits
they
reckoned
that
if
the
south
were
to
work
up
her
own
cotton
she
would
realize
from
seventy
to
one
hundred
millions
a
year
that
otherwise
went
north
finally
to
cap
the
climax
they
regretted
that
planters
spent
some
fifteen
millions
a
year
in
the
alluring
cities
and
summer
resorts
of
the
north
opposition
to
northern
proceeding
from
these
premises
southern
leaders
drew
the
logical
conclusion
that
the
entire
program
of
economic
measures
demanded
in
the
north
was
without
exception
adverse
to
southern
interests
and
by
a
similar
chain
of
reasoning
injurious
to
the
corn
and
wheat
producers
of
the
west
cheap
labor
afforded
by
free
immigration
a
protective
tariff
raising
prices
of
manufactures
for
the
tiller
of
the
soil
ship
subsidies
increasing
the
tonnage
of
carrying
trade
in
northern
hands
internal
improvements
forging
new
economic
bonds
between
the
east
and
the
west
a
national
banking
system
giving
strict
national
control
over
the
currency
as
a
safeguard
against
paper
inflation
all
these
devices
were
regarded
in
the
south
as
contrary
to
the
planting
interest
they
were
constantly
compared
with
the
restrictive
measures
by
which
great
britain
more
than
half
a
century
before
had
sought
to
bind
american
interests
as
oppression
justified
a
war
for
independence
once
statesmen
argued
so
it
can
justify
it
again
it
is
curious
as
it
is
melancholy
and
distressing
came
a
broad
hint
from
south
carolina
to
see
how
striking
is
the
analogy
between
the
colonial
vassalage
to
which
the
manufacturing
states
have
reduced
the
planting
states
and
that
which
formerly
bound
the
colonies
to
the
british
empire
england
said
to
her
american
colonies
shall
not
trade
with
the
rest
of
the
world
for
such
manufactures
as
are
produced
in
the
mother
country
the
manufacturing
states
say
to
their
southern
colonies
shall
not
trade
with
the
rest
of
the
world
for
such
manufactures
as
we
produce
the
conclusion
was
inexorable
either
the
south
must
control
the
national
government
and
its
economic
measures
or
it
must
declare
as
america
had
done
four
score
years
before
its
political
and
economic
independence
as
northern
mills
multiplied
as
railways
spun
their
mighty
web
over
the
face
of
the
north
and
as
accumulated
capital
rose
into
the
hundreds
of
millions
the
conviction
of
the
planters
and
their
statesmen
deepened
into
desperation
to
start
southern
industries
a
few
of
them
seeing
the
predominance
of
the
north
made
determined
efforts
to
introduce
manufactures
into
the
south
to
the
leaders
who
were
averse
to
secession
and
nullification
this
seemed
the
only
remedy
for
the
growing
disparity
in
the
power
of
the
two
sections
societies
for
the
encouragement
of
mechanical
industries
were
formed
the
investment
of
capital
was
sought
and
indeed
a
few
mills
were
built
on
southern
soil
the
results
were
meager
the
natural
resources
coal
and
water
power
were
abundant
but
the
enterprise
for
direction
and
the
skilled
labor
were
wanting
the
stream
of
european
immigration
flowed
north
and
west
not
south
the
irish
or
german
laborer
even
if
he
finally
made
his
home
in
a
city
had
before
him
while
in
the
north
the
alternative
of
a
homestead
on
western
land
to
him
slavery
was
a
strange
if
not
a
repelling
institution
he
did
not
take
to
it
kindly
nor
care
to
fix
his
home
where
it
flourished
while
slavery
lasted
the
economy
of
the
south
was
inevitably
agricultural
while
agriculture
predominated
leadership
with
equal
necessity
fell
to
the
planting
interest
while
the
planting
interest
ruled
political
opposition
to

was
destined
to
grow
in
strength
southern
theory
of
in
the
opinion
of
the
statesmen
who
frankly
represented
the
planting
interest
the
industrial
system
was
its
deadly
enemy
their
entire
philosophy
of
american
politics
was
summed
up
in
a
single
paragraph
by
mcduffie
a
spokesman
for
south
carolina
owing
to
the
federative
character
of
our
government
the
great
geographical
extent
of
our
territory
and
the
diversity
of
the
pursuits
of
our
citizens
in
different
parts
of
the
union
it
has
so
happened
that
two
great
interests
have
sprung
up
standing
directly
opposed
to
each
other
one
of
these
consists
of
those
manufactures
which
the
northern
and
middle
states
are
capable
of
producing
but
which
owing
to
the
high
price
of
labor
and
the
high
profits
of
capital
in
those
states
can
not
hold
competition
with
foreign
manufactures
without
the
aid
of
bounties
directly
or
indirectly
given
either
by
the
general
government
or
by
the
state
governments
the
other
of
these
interests
consists
of
the
great
agricultural
staples
of
the
southern
states
which
can
find
a
market
only
in
foreign
countries
and
which
can
be
advantageously
sold
only
in
exchange
for
foreign
manufactures
which
come
in
competition
with
those
of
the
northern
and
middle
states
these
interests
then
stand
diametrically
and
irreconcilably
opposed
to
each
other
the
interest
the
pecuniary
interest
of
the
northern
manufacturer
is
directly
promoted
by
every
increase
of
the
taxes
imposed
upon
southern
commerce
and
it
is
unnecessary
to
add
that
the
interest
of
the
southern
planter
is
promoted
by
every
diminution
of
taxes
imposed
upon
the
productions
of
their
industry
if
under
these
circumstances
the
manufacturers
were
clothed
with
the
power
of
imposing
taxes
at
their
pleasure
upon
the
foreign
imports
of
the
planter
no
doubt
would
exist
in
the
mind
of
any
man
that
it
would
have
all
the
characteristics
of
an
absolute
and
unqualified
despotism
the
economic
soundness
of
this
reasoning
a
subject
of
interesting
speculation
for
the
economist
is
of
little
concern
to
the
historian
the
historical
point
is
that
this
opinion
was
widely
held
in
the
south
and
with
the
progress
of
time
became
the
prevailing
doctrine
of
the
planting
statesmen
their
antagonism
was
deepened
because
they
also
became
convinced
on
what
grounds
it
is
not
necessary
to
inquire
that
the
leaders
of
the
industrial
interest
thus
opposed
to
planting
formed
a
consolidated
aristocracy
of
wealth
bent
upon
the
pursuit
and
attainment
of
political
power
at
washington
by
the
aid
of
various
associated
interests

the

the

acting
upon

interests

and
the
prejudices
of
others
have
obtained
a
decided
and
permanent
control

opinion

southern

in
a
little
while
the

was
gone
just
as
jacksonian

rose
to

there
appeared
a
new
kind
of
doctrine
the
dogmatism
of
the
abolition
agitator
for
mild
speculation
on

evils
of
the

was
substituted

imperious
and

demand

william
lloyd
garrison
founded
in
boston
his
paper
with
singleness
of
purpose
and
utter
contempt
for
all
opposing
opinions
and
arguments
he
pursued
his
course
of
passionate
denunciation
he
apologized
for
having
ever
assented
to
the
popular
but
pernicious
doctrine
of
gradual
abolition
he
chose
for
his
motto
immediate
and
unconditional
emancipation
he
promised
his
readers
that
he
would
be
harsh
as
truth
and
uncompromising
as
justice
that
he
would
not
think
or
speak
or
write
with
moderation
then
he
flung
out
his
defiant
call
i
am
in

i
will
not
equivocate
i
will
not
excuse
i
will
not
retreat
a
single
inch

i
will
be

the
vow

though
garrison
complained
that
the
apathy
of
the
people
is
enough
to
make
every
statue
leap
from
its
pedestal
he
soon
learned
how
alive
the
masses
were
to
the
meaning
of
his
propaganda
abolition
orators
were
stoned
in
the
street
and
hissed
from
the
platform
their
meeting
places
were
often
attacked
and
sometimes
burned

garrison
himself

lovejoy
a

in

illinois
for
his
willingness
to
give
abolition
a
fair

brutally
murdered
his

was
broken
to
pieces
as
a
warning
to
all
those
who
disturbed
the
nation
peace
of

the
south
doubly
frightened
by
a
slave
revolt
in
which
ended
in
the
murder
of
a
number
of
men
women
and
children
closed
all
discussion
of

in
that
section
now
exclaimed

it
is
a
question
which
admits
of
neither

and
excoriated

in
the
south
those
abolitionists
not
gifted
as
speakers
or
writers
signed
petitions
against
slavery
and
poured
them
in
upon
congress
the
flood
of
them
was
so
continuous
that
the
house
of
representatives
forgetting
its
traditions
adopted
in
a
gag
rule
which
prevented
the
reading
of
appeals
and
consigned
them
to
the
waste
basket
not
until
the
whigs
were
in
power
nearly
ten
years
later

able

how
deep
was
the
impression
made
upon
the
country
by
this
agitation
for
immediate
and
unconditional

can
not
be
measured
if
the
popular
vote
for
those
candidates
who
opposed
not
slavery
but
its
extension
to
the
territories
be
taken
as
a
standard
it
was
slight
indeed
in
the

candidate
birney
polled
votes
out
of
over
a
million
and
a
half
the
free
soil
vote
of
the
next
campaign
went
beyond
a
quarter
of
a
million
but
the
increase
was
due
to
the
strength
of
the
leader
martin
van
buren
four
years
afterward
it
receded
to
affording
all
the
outward
signs
for
the
belief
that
the
pleas
of
the
abolitionist
found
no
widespread
response
among
the
people
yet
the
agitation
undoubtedly
ran
deeper
than
the
ballot
box
young
statesmen
of
the
north
in
whose
hands
the
destiny
of
frightful
years
was
to
lie
found
their
indifference
to
slavery
broken
and
their
consciences
stirred
by
the
unending
appeal
and
the
tireless
reiteration
charles
sumner
afterward
boasted
that
he
read
the
two
years
before
wendell
phillips
the
young
boston
lawyer
who
cast
aside
his
profession
to
take
up
the
dangerous
cause
southern
opposition
to
in
the
south
the
sentiment
against
slavery
was
strong
it
led
some
to
believe
that
it
would
also
come
to
an
end
there
in
due
time
washington
disliked
it
and
directed
in
his
will
that
his
own
slaves
should
be
set
free
after
the
death
of
his
wife
jefferson
looking
into
the
future
condemned
the
system
by
which
he
also
lived
saying
can
the
liberties
of
a
nation
be
thought
secure
when
we
have
removed
their
only
firm
basis
a
conviction
in
the
minds
of
the
people
that
their
liberties
are
the
gift
of
god
are
they
not
to
be
violated
but
with
his
wrath
indeed
i
tremble
for
my
country
when
i
reflect
that
god
is
just
that
his
justice
can
not
sleep
forever
nor
did
southern
men
confine
their
sentiments
to
expressions
of
academic
opinion
they
accepted
in
the
ordinance
which
excluded
slavery
from
the
northwest
territory
forever
and
also
the
missouri
compromise
which
shut
it
out
of
a
vast
section
of
the
louisiana
territory
revolution
in
the
slave
among
the
representatives
of
south
carolina
and
georgia
however
the
views
of
washington
and
jefferson
were
by
no
means
approved
and
the
drift
of
southern
economy
was
decidedly
in
favor
of
extending
and
perpetuating
rather
than
abolishing
the
system
of
chattel
servitude
the
invention
of
the
cotton
gin
and
textile
machinery
created
a
market
for
cotton
which
the
planters
with
all
their
skill
and
energy
could
hardly
supply
almost
every
available
acre
was
brought
under
cotton
culture
as
the
small
farmers
were
driven
steadily
from
the
seaboard
into
the
uplands
or
to
the
northwest
the
demand
for
slaves
to
till
the
swiftly
expanding
fields
was
enormous
the
number
of
bondmen
rose
from
in
washington
day
to
more
than
three
millions
in
at
the
same
time
slavery
itself
was
transformed
instead
of
the
homestead
where
the
same
family
of
masters
kept
the
same
families
of
slaves
from
generation
to
generation
came
the
plantation
system
of
the
far
south
and
southwest
where
masters
were
ever
moving
and
ever
extending
their
holdings
of
lands
and
slaves
this
in
turn
reacted
on
the
older
south
where
the
raising
of
slaves
for
the
market
became
a
regular
and
highly
profitable
business
illustration
an
old
john
calhoun
defended
as
a
positive
as
the
abolition
agitation
increased
and
the
planting
system
expanded
apologies
for
slavery
became
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
south
then
apologies
were
superseded
by
claims
that
slavery
was
a
beneficial
scheme
of
labor
control
calhoun
in
a
famous
speech
in
the
senate
in
sounded
the
new
note
by
declaring
slavery
instead
of
an
evil
a
good
a
positive
good
his
reasoning
was
as
follows
in
every
civilized
society
one
portion
of
the
community
must
live
on
the
labor
of
another
learning
science
and
the
arts
are
built
upon
leisure
the
african
slave
kindly
treated
by
his
master
and
mistress
and
looked
after
in
his
old
age
is
better
off
than
the
free
laborers
of
europe
and
under
the
slave
system
conflicts
between
capital
and
labor
are
avoided
the
advantages
of
slavery
in
this
respect
he
concluded
will
become
more
and
more
manifest
if
left
undisturbed
by
interference
from
without
as
the
country
advances
in
wealth
and
numbers
owners
dominate
the
new
doctrine
of
calhoun
was
eagerly
seized
by
the
planters
as
they
came
more
and
more
to
overshadow
the
small
farmers
of
the
south
and
as
they
beheld
the
menace
of
abolition
growing
upon
the
horizon
it
formed
as
they
viewed
matters
a
moral
defense
for
their
labor
system
sound
logical
invincible
it
warranted
them
in
drawing
together
for
the
protection
of
an
institution
so
necessary
so
inevitable
so
beneficent
though
in
the
slave
owners
were
only
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
in
a
national
population
of
nearly
twenty
million
whites
they
had
an
influence
all
out
of
proportion
to
their
numbers
they
were
knit
together
by
the
bonds
of
a
common
interest
they
had
leisure
and
wealth
they
could
travel
and
attend
conferences
and
conventions
throughout
the
south
and
largely
in
the
north
they
had
the
press
the
schools
and
the
pulpits
on
their
side
they
formed
as
it
were
a
mighty
union
for
the
protection
and
advancement
of
their
common
cause
aided
by
those
mechanics
and
farmers
of
the
north
who
stuck
by
jacksonian
democracy
through
thick
and
thin
the
planters
became
a
power
in
the
federal
government
we
nominate
presidents
exultantly
boasted
a
richmond
newspaper
the
north
elects
them
this
jubilant
southern
claim
was
conceded
by
william
seward
a
republican
senator
from
new
york
in
a
speech
describing
the
power
of
slavery
in
the
national
government
a
party
he
said
is
in
one
sense
a
joint
stock
association
in
which
those
who
contribute
most
direct
the
action
and
management
of
the
concern
the
slaveholders
contributing
in
an
overwhelming
proportion
to
the
strength
of
the
democratic
party
necessarily
dictate
and
prescribe
its
policy
he
went
on
the
slaveholding
class
has
become
the
governing
power
in
each
of
the
slaveholding
states
and
it
practically
chooses
thirty
of
the
members
of
the
senate
ninety
of
the
two
hundred
and
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
one
hundred
and
five
of
the
two
hundred
and
electors
of
president
and
of
the
united
states
then
he
considered
the
slave
power
in
the
supreme
court
that
tribunal
he
exclaimed
consists
of
a
chief
justice
and
eight
associate
justices
of
these
five
were
called
from
slave
states
and
four
from
free
states
the
opinions
and
bias
of
each
of
them
were
carefully
considered
by
the
president
and
senate
when
he
was
appointed
not
one
of
them
was
found
wanting
in
soundness
of
politics
according
to
the
slaveholder
exposition
of
the
constitution
such
was
the
northern
view
of
the
planting
interest
that
from
the
arena
of
national
politics
challenged
the
whole
country
in
illustration
distribution
of
slaves
in
the
southern
states
slavery
in
national
politics
aspects
of
it
may
be
asked
why
it
was
that
slavery
founded
originally
on
state
law
and
subject
to
state
government
was
drawn
into
the
current
of
national
affairs
the
answer
is
simple
there
were
in
the
first
place
constitutional
reasons
the
congress
of
the
united
states
had
to
make
all
needful
rules
for
the
government
of
the
territories
the
district
of
columbia
the
forts
and
other
property
under
national
authority
so
it
was
compelled
to
determine
whether
slavery
should
exist
in
the
places
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
upon
congress
was
also
conferred
the
power
of
admitting
new
states
whenever
a
territory
asked
for
admission
the
issue
could
be
raised
as
to
whether
slavery
should
be
sanctioned
or
excluded
under
the
constitution
provision
was
made
for
the
return
of
runaway
slaves
congress
had
the
power
to
enforce
this
clause
by
appropriate
legislation
since
the
control
of
the
post
office
was
vested
in
the
federal
government
it
had
to
face
the
problem
raised
by
the
transmission
of
abolition
literature
through
the
mails
finally
citizens
had
the
right
of
petition
it
inheres
in
all
free
government
and
it
is
expressly
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
it
was
therefore
legal
for
abolitionists
to
present
to
congress
their
petitions
even
if
they
asked
for
something
which
it
had
no
right
to
grant
it
was
thus
impossible
constitutionally
to
draw
a
cordon
around
the
slavery
issue
and
confine
the
discussion
of
it
to
state
politics
there
were
in
the
second
place
economic
reasons
why
slavery
was
inevitably
drawn
into
the
national
sphere
it
was
the
basis
of
the
planting
system
which
had
direct
commercial
relations
with
the
north
and
european
countries
it
was
affected
by
federal
laws
respecting
tariffs
bounties
ship
subsidies
banking
and
kindred
matters
the
planters
of
the
south
almost
without
exception
looked
upon
the
protective
tariff
as
a
tribute
laid
upon
them
for
the
benefit
of
northern
industries
as
heavy
borrowers
of
money
in
the
north
they
were
generally
in
favor
of
easy
money
if
not
paper
currency
as
an
aid
in
the
repayment
of
their
debts
this
threw
most
of
them
into
opposition
to
the
whig
program
for
a
united
states
bank
all
financial
aids
to
american
shipping
they
stoutly
resisted
preferring
to
rely
upon
the
cheaper
service
rendered
by
english
shippers
internal
improvements
those
substantial
ties
that
were
binding
the
west
to
the
east
and
turning
the
traffic
from
new
orleans
to
philadelphia
and
new
york
they
viewed
with
alarm
free
homesteads
from
the
public
lands
which
tended
to
overbalance
the
south
by
building
free
states
became
to
them
a
measure
dangerous
to
their
interests
thus
national
economic
policies
which
could
not
by
any
twist
or
turn
be
confined
to
state
control
drew
the
slave
system
and
its
defenders
into
the
political
conflict
that
centered
at
washington
and
the
territories
the
missouri
compromise
though
men
continually
talked
about
taking
slavery
out
of
politics
it
could
not
be
done
by
slavery
had
become
so
entrenched
and
the
sentiment
so
strong
that
missouri
quest
for
admission
brought
both
houses
of
congress
into
a
deadlock
that
was
broken
only
by
compromise
the
south
having
half
the
senators
could
prevent
the
admission
of
missouri
stripped
of
slavery
and
the
north
powerful
in
the
house
of
representatives
could
keep
missouri
with
slavery
out
of
the
union
indefinitely
an
adjustment
of
pretensions
was
the
last
resort
maine
separated
from
the
parent
state
of
massachusetts
was
brought
into
the
union
with
freedom
and
missouri
with
bondage
at
the
same
time
it
was
agreed
that
the
remainder
of
the
vast
louisiana
territory
north
of
the
parallel
of
should
be
like
the
old
northwest
forever
free
while
the
southern
portion
was
left
to
slavery
in
reality
this
was
an
immense
gain
for
liberty
the
area
dedicated
to
free
farmers
was
many
times
greater
than
that
left
to
the
planters
the
principle
was
once
more
asserted
that
congress
had
full
power
to
prevent
slavery
in
the
territories

the
missouri
compromise
territorial
question
reopened
by
the
wilmot

for

forty
years
these
three
had

all

calhoun
was
already
broken
in
health
and
in
a
few
months
was
to
be
borne
from

clay
and
webster
had

two
more
years
in

all
these
things
they
now
marshaled
in

mighty

to
solve

problem
on
january
clay
offered
to
the
senate
a
compromise
granting
concessions
to
both
sides
and
a
few
days
later
in
a
powerful
oration
he
made
a
passionate
appeal
for
a
union
of
hearts
through
mutual
sacrifices
calhoun
relentlessly
demanded
the
full
measure
of
justice
for
the
south
equal
rights
in
the
territories
bought
by
common
blood
the
return
of
runaway

abolitionists
and
the
restoration
of
the
balance
of

between
the
north
and
the
south
webster
in
his
notable
seventh
of
march
speech
condemned
the
wilmot
proviso
advocated
a
strict
enforcement
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
denounced
the
abolitionists
and
made
a
final
plea
for
the
constitution
union
and
liberty
this
was
the
address
which
called
forth
from
whittier
the
poem
ichabod
deploring
the
fall
of
the
mighty
one
whom
he
thought
lost
to
all
sense
of
faith
and
honor
terms
of
the
compromise
of
when
the
debates
were
closed
the
results
were
totaled
in
a
series
of
compromise
measures
all
of
which
were
signed
in
september
by
the
new
president
millard
fillmore
who
had
taken
office
two
months
before
on
the
death
of
zachary
taylor
by
these
acts
the
boundaries
of
texas
were
adjusted
and
the
territory
of
new
mexico
created
subject
to
the
provision
that
all
or
any
part
of
it
might
be
admitted
to
the
union
with
or
without
slavery
as
their
constitution
may
provide
at
the
time
of
their
admission
the
territory
of
utah
was
similarly
organized
with
the
same
conditions
as
to
slavery
thus
repudiating
the
wilmot
proviso
without
guaranteeing
slavery
to
the
planters
california
was
admitted
as
a
free
state
under
a
constitution
in
which
the
people
of
the
territory
had
themselves
prohibited
slavery
the
slave
trade
was
abolished
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
slavery
itself
existed
as
before
at
the
capital
of
the
nation
this
concession
to
sentiment
was
more
than
offset
by
a
fugitive
slave
law
drastic
in
spirit
and
in
letter
it
placed
the
enforcement
of
its
terms
in
the
hands
of
federal
officers
appointed
from
washington
and
so
removed
it
from
the
control
of
authorities
locally
elected
it
provided
that
masters
or
their
agents
on
filing
claims
in
due
form
might
summarily
remove
their
escaped
slaves
without
affording
their
alleged
fugitives
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
the
right
to
witness
the
right
to
offer
any
testimony
in
evidence
finally
to
put
teeth
into
the
act
heavy
penalties
were
prescribed
for
all
who
obstructed
or
assisted
in
obstructing
the
enforcement
of
the
law
such
was
the
great
compromise
of
illustration
an
old
cartoon
representing
webster
stealing
thunder
triumph
in
the
election
of
the
results
of
the
election
of
seemed
to
show
conclusively
that
the
nation
was
weary
of
slavery
agitation
and
wanted
peace
both
parties
whigs
and
democrats
endorsed
the
fugitive
slave
law
and
approved
the
great
compromise
the
democrats
with
franklin
pierce
as
their
leader
swept
the
country
against
the
war
hero
general
winfield
scott
on
whom
the
whigs
had
staked
their
hopes
even
webster
broken
with
grief
at
his
failure
to
receive
the
nomination
advised
his
friends
to
vote
for
pierce
and
turned
away
from
politics
to
meditate
upon
approaching
death
the
verdict
of
the
voters
would
seem
to
indicate
that
for
the
time
everybody
save
a
handful
of
disgruntled
agitators
looked
upon
settlement
as
the
last
word
the
people
especially
the
business
men
of
the
country
says
elson
were
utterly
weary
of
the
agitation
and
they
gave
their
suffrages
to
the
party
that
promised
them
rest
the
free
soil
party
condemning
slavery
as
a
sin
against
god
and
a
crime
against
man
and
advocating
freedom
for
the
territories
failed
to
carry
a
single
state
in
fact
it
polled
fewer
votes
than
it
had
four
years
earlier
as
against
nearly
the
combined
vote
of
the
whigs
and
democrats
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
president
pierce
surrounded
in
his
cabinet
by
strong
southern
sympathizers
could
promise
to
put
an
end
to
slavery
agitation
and
to
crush
the
abolition
movement
in
the
bud
agitation
the
promise
was
more
difficult
to
fulfill
than
to
utter
in
fact
the
vigorous
execution
of
one
measure
included
in
the
compromise
the
fugitive
slave
law
only
made
matters
worse
designed
as
security
for
the
planters
it
proved
a
powerful
instrument
in
their
undoing
slavery
five
hundred
miles
away

louisiana

so
remote
from
the
north

only
the
strongest
imagination

in

hamlets

another
matter

the
most
odious

compromise
the
leader
in
this
fateful
enterprise
was
stephen
douglas
senator
from
illinois
and
the
occasion
for
the
deed
was
the
demand
for
the
organization
of
territorial
government
in
the
regions
west
of
iowa
and
missouri
douglas
like
clay
and
webster
before
him
was
consumed
by
a
strong
passion
for
the
presidency
and
to
reach
his
goal
it
was
necessary
to
win
the
support
of
the
south
this
he
undoubtedly
sought
to
do
when
he
introduced
on
january
a
bill
organizing
the
nebraska
territory
on
the
principle
of
the
compromise
of
namely
that
the
people
in
the
territory
might
themselves
decide
whether
they
would
have
slavery
or
not
unwittingly
the
avalanche
was
started
after
a
stormy
debate
in
which
important
amendments
were
forced
on
douglas
the
bill
became
a
law
on
may
the
measure
created
two
territories
kansas
and

and
provided
that
they
or

organized
out
of
them
could
come
into
the

as
states
with
or
without
slavery
as
their
constitutions
may
prescribe
at
the
time
of
their
admission
not
content
with
this
the
law
went
on
to
declare
the
missouri
compromise
null
and
void
as
being
inconsistent
with
the
principle
of
by
congress
with
slavery
in
the
states
and
territories
thus
by
a
single
blow
the
very
heart
of
the
continent

to

brought
suit
for

he
became
a
slave
again
in
missouri
by
virtue
of
the
law
of
that
state
the
court
however
faced
the
issue
squarely
it
held
that
scott
had
not
been
free
anywhere
and
that
besides
the
missouri
compromise
violated
the
constitution
and
was
null
and
void
the
decision
was
a
triumph
for
the
south
it
meant
that
congress
after
all
had
no
power
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
territories
under
the
decree
of
the
highest
court
in
the
land
that
could
be
done
only
by
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
which
required
a
vote
in
congress
and
the
approval
of
of
the
states
such
an
amendment
was
obviously
impossible
the
southern
states
were
too
numerous
but
the
republicans
were
not
daunted
we
know
said
lincoln
the
court
that
made
it
has
often
overruled
its
own
decisions
and
we
shall
do
what
we
can
to
have
it
overrule
this
legislatures
of
northern
states
passed
resolutions
condemning
the
decision
and
the
republican
platform
of
characterized
the
dogma
that
the
constitution
carried
slavery
into
the
territories
as
a
dangerous
political
heresy
at
variance
with
the
explicit
provisions
of
that
instrument
itself
with
legislative
and
judicial
precedent
revolutionary
in
tendency
and
subversive
of
the
peace
and
harmony
of
the
country
panic
of
in
the
midst
of
the
acrimonious
dispute
over
the
dred
scott
decision
came
one
of
the
worst
business
panics
which
ever
afflicted
the
country
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
fourteen
railroad
corporations
including
the
erie
michigan
central
and
the
illinois
central
failed
to
meet
their
obligations
banks
and
insurance
companies
some
of
them
the
largest
and
strongest
institutions
in
the
north
closed
their
doors
stocks
and
bonds
came
down
in
a
crash
on
the
markets
manufacturing
was
paralyzed
tens
of
thousands
of
working
people
were
thrown
out
of
employment
hunger
meetings
of
idle
men
were
held
in
the
cities
and
banners
bearing
the
inscription
we
want
bread
were
flung
out
in
new
york
working
men
threatened
to
invade
the
council
chamber
to
demand
work
or
bread
and
the
frightened
mayor
called
for
the
police
and
soldiers
for
this
distressing
state
of
affairs
many
remedies
were
offered
none
with
more
zeal
and
persistence
than
the
proposal
for
a
higher
tariff
to
take
the
place
of
the
law
of
march
a
democratic
measure
making
drastic
reductions
in
the
rates
of
duty
in
the
manufacturing
districts
of
the
north
the
panic
was
ascribed
to
the
democratic
assault
on
business
so
an
old
issue
was
again
vigorously
advanced
preparatory
to
the
next
presidential
campaign
the
following
year
the
interest
of
the
whole
country
was
drawn
to
a
series
of
debates
held
in
illinois
by
lincoln
and
douglas
both
candidates
for
the
united
states
senate
in
the
course
of
his
campaign
lincoln
had
uttered
his
trenchant
saying
that
a
house
divided
against
itself
can
not
stand
i
believe
this
government
can
not
endure
permanently
half
slave
and
half
free
at
the
same
time
he
had
accused
douglas
buchanan
and
the
supreme
court
of
acting
in
concert
to
make
slavery
national
this
daring
statement
arrested
the
attention
of
douglas
who
was
making
his
campaign
on
the
doctrine
of
squatter
sovereignty
that
is
the
right
of
the
people
of
each
territory
to
vote
slavery
up
or
down
after
a
few
shots
at
each
other
the
candidates
agreed
to
meet
face
to
face
and
discuss
the
issues
of
the
day
never
had
such
crowds
been
seen
at
political
meetings
in
illinois
farmers
deserted
their
plows
smiths
their
forges
and
housewives
their
baking
to
hear
honest
abe
and
the
little
giant
the
results
of
the
series
of
debates
were
momentous
lincoln
clearly
defined
his
position
the
south
he
admitted
was
entitled
under
the
constitution
to
a
fair
fugitive
slave
law
he
hoped
that
there
might
be
no
new
slave
states
but
he
did
not
see
how
congress
could
exclude
the
people
of
a
territory
from
admission
as
a
state
if
they
saw
fit
to
adopt
a
constitution
legalizing
the
ownership
of
slaves
he
favored
the
gradual
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
total
exclusion
of
it
from
the
territories
of
the
united
states
by
act
of
congress
moreover
he
drove
douglas
into
a
hole
by
asking
how
he
squared
squatter
sovereignty
with
the
dred
scott
decision
how
in
other
words
the
people
of
a
territory
could
abolish
slavery
when
the
court
had
declared
that
congress
the
superior
power
could
not
do
it
under
the
constitution
to
this
baffling
question
douglas
lamely
replied
that
the
inhabitants
of
a
territory
by
unfriendly
legislation
might
make
property
in
slaves
insecure
and
thus
destroy
the
institution
this
answer
to
lincoln
query
alienated
many
southern
democrats
who
believed
that
the
dred
scott
decision
settled
the
question
of
slavery
in
the
territories
for
all
time
douglas
won
the
election
to
the
senate
but
lincoln
lifted
into
national
fame
by
the
debates
beat
him
in
the
campaign
for
president
two
years
later
brown
to
the
abolitionists
the
line
of
argument
pursued
by
lincoln
including
his
proposal
to
leave
slavery
untouched
in
the
states
where
it
existed
was
wholly
unsatisfactory
one
of
them
a
grim
and
resolute
man
inflamed
by
a
hatred
for
slavery
in
itself
turned
from
agitation
to
violence
these
men
are
all
talk
what
is
needed
is
action
action
so
spoke
john
brown
of
new
york
during
the
sanguinary
struggle
in
kansas
he
hurried
to
the
frontier
gun
and
dagger
in
hand
to
help
drive
slave
owners
from
the
free
soil
of
the
west
there
he
committed
deeds
of
such
daring
and
cruelty
that
he
was
outlawed
and
a
price
put
upon
his
head
still
he
kept
on
the
path
of
action
aided
by
funds
from
northern
friends
he
gathered
a
small
band
of
his
followers
around
him
saying
to
them
if
god
be
for
us
who
can
be
against
us
he
went
into
virginia
in
the
autumn
of
hoping
as
he
explained
to
effect
a
mighty
conquest
even
though
it
be
like
the
last
victory
of
samson
he
seized
the
government
armory
at
harper
ferry
declared
free
the
slaves
whom
he
found
and
called
upon
them
to
take
up
arms
in
defense
of
their
liberty
his
was
a
hope
as
forlorn
as
it
was
desperate
armed
forces
came
down
upon
him
and
after
a
hard
battle
captured
him
tried
for
treason
brown
was
condemned
to
death
the
governor
of
virginia
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
pleas
for
clemency
based
on
the
ground
that
the
prisoner
was
simply
a
lunatic
this
is
a
beautiful
country
said
the
stern
old
brown
glancing
upward
to
the
eternal
hills
on
his
way
to
the
gallows
as
calmly
as
if
he
were
returning
home
from
a
long
journey
so
perish
all
such
enemies
of
virginia
all
such
enemies
of
the
union
all
such
foes
of
the
human
race
solemnly
announced
the
executioner
as
he
fulfilled
the
judgment
of
the
law
the
raid
and
its
grim
ending
deeply
moved
the
country
abolitionists
looked
upon
brown
as
a
martyr
and
tolled
funeral
bells
on
the
day
of
his
execution
longfellow
wrote
in
his
diary
this
will
be
a
great
day
in
our
history
the
date
of
a
new
revolution
as
much
needed
as
the
old
one
jefferson
davis
saw
in
the
affair
the
invasion
of
a
state
by
a
murderous
gang
of
abolitionists
bent
on
inciting
slaves
to
murder
helpless
women
and
children
a
crime
for
which
the
leader
had
met
a
felon
death
lincoln
spoke
of
the
raid
as
absurd
the
deed
of
an
enthusiast
who
had
brooded
over
the
oppression
of
a
people
until
he
fancied
himself
commissioned
by
heaven
to
liberate
them
an
attempt
which
ended
in
little
else
than
his
own
execution
to
republican
leaders
as
a
whole
the
event
was
very
embarrassing
they
were
taunted
by
the
democrats
with
responsibility
for
the
deed
douglas
declared
his
firm
and
deliberate
conviction
that
the
harper
ferry
crime
was
the
natural
logical
inevitable
result
of
the
doctrines
and
teachings
of
the
republican
party
so
persistent
were
such
attacks
that
the
republicans
felt
called
upon
in
to
denounce
brown
raid
as
among
the
gravest
of
crimes
democrats
when
the
democratic
convention
met
at
charleston
in
the
spring
of
a
few
months
after
brown
execution
it
soon
became
clear
that
there
was
danger
ahead
between
the
extreme
slavery
advocates
of
the
far
south
and
the
democrats
of
the
douglas
type
there
was
a
chasm
which
no
appeals
to
party
loyalty
could
bridge
as
the
spokesman
of
the
west
douglas
knew
that
while
the
north
was
not
abolitionist
it
was
passionately
set
against
an
extension
of
slavery
into
the
territories
by
act
of
congress
that
squatter
sovereignty
was
the
mildest
kind
of
compromise
acceptable
to
the
farmers
whose
votes
would
determine
the
fate
of
the
election
southern
leaders
would
not
accept
his
opinion
yancey
speaking
for
alabama
refused
to
palter
with
any
plan
not
built
on
the
proposition
that
slavery
was
in
itself
right
he
taunted
the
northern
democrats
with
taking
the
view
that
slavery
was
wrong
but
that
they
could
not
do
anything
about
it
that
he
said
was
the
fatal
error
the
cause
of
all
discord
the
source
of
black
republicanism
as
well
as
squatter
sovereignty
the
gauntlet
was
thus
thrown
down
at
the
feet
of
the
northern
delegates
you
must
not
apologize
for
slavery
you
must
declare
it
right
you
must
advocate
its
extension
the
challenge
so
bluntly
put
was
as
bluntly
answered
gentlemen
of
the
south
responded
a
delegate
from
ohio
you
mistake
us
you
mistake
us
we
will
not
do
it
for
ten
days
the
charleston
convention
wrangled
over
the
platform
and
balloted
for
the
nomination
of
a
candidate
douglas
though
in
the
lead
could
not
get
the
vote
required
for
victory
for
more
than
fifty
times
the
roll
of
the
convention
was
called
without
a
decision
then
in
sheer
desperation
the
convention
adjourned
to
meet
later
at
baltimore
when
the
delegates
again
assembled
their
passions
ran
as
high
as
ever
the
division
into
two
irreconcilable
factions
was
unchanged
uncompromising
delegates
from
the
south
withdrew
to
richmond
nominated
john
breckinridge
of
kentucky
for
president
and
put
forth
a
platform
asserting
the
rights
of
slave
owners
in
the
territories
and
the
duty
of
the
federal
government
to
protect
them
the
delegates
who
remained
at
baltimore
nominated
douglas
and
endorsed
his
doctrine
of
squatter
sovereignty
constitutional
union
while
the
democratic
party
was
being
disrupted
a
fragment
of
the
former
whig
party
known
as
the
constitutional
unionists
held
a
convention
at
baltimore
and
selected
national
candidates
john
bell
from
tennessee
and
edward
everett
from
massachusetts
a
melancholy
interest
attached
to
this
assembly
it
was
mainly
composed
of
old
men
whose
political
views
were
those
of
clay
and
webster
cherished
leaders
now
dead
and
gone
in
their
platform
they
sought
to
exorcise
the
evil
spirit
of
partisanship
by
inviting
their
fellow
citizens
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
country
the
union
of
the
states
and
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
the
party
that
campaigned
on
this
grand
sentiment
only
drew
laughter
from
the
democrats
and
derision
from
the
republicans
and
polled
less
than
the
votes
republican
with
the
whigs
definitely
forced
into
a
separate
group
the
republican
convention
at
chicago
was
fated
to
be
sectional
in
character
although
five
slave
states
did
send
delegates
as
the
democrats
were
split
the
party
that
had
led
a
forlorn
hope
four
years
before
was
on
the
high
road
to
success
at
last
new
and
powerful
recruits
were
found
the
advocates
of
a
high
protective
tariff
and
the
friends
of
free
homesteads
for
farmers
and
workingmen
mingled
with
enthusiastic
foes
of
slavery
while
still
firm
in
their
opposition
to
slavery
in
the
territories
the
republicans
went
on
record
in
favor
of
a
homestead
law
granting
free
lands
to
settlers
and
approved
customs
duties
designed
to
encourage
the
development
of
the
industrial
interests
of
the
whole
country
the
platform
was
greeted
with
cheers
which
according
to
the
stenographic
report
of
the
convention
became
loud
and
prolonged
as
the
protective
tariff
and
homestead
planks
were
read
having
skillfully
drawn
a
platform
to
unite
the
north
in
opposition
to
slavery
and
the
planting
system
the
republicans
were
also
adroit
in
their
selection
of
a
candidate
the
tariff
plank
might
carry
pennsylvania
a
democratic
state
but
ohio
indiana
and
illinois
were
equally
essential
to
success
at
the
polls
the
southern
counties
of
these
states
were
filled
with
settlers
from
virginia
north
carolina
and
kentucky
who
even
if
they
had
no
love
for
slavery
were
no
friends
of
abolition
moreover
remembering
the
old
fight
on
the
united
states
bank
in
andrew
jackson
day
they
were
suspicious
of
men
from
the
east
accordingly
they
did
not
favor
the
candidacy
of
seward
the
leading
republican
statesman
and
favorite
son
of
new
york
after
much
trading
and
discussing
the
convention
came
to
the
conclusion
that
abraham
lincoln
of
illinois
was
the
most
available
candidate
he
was
of
southern
origin
born
in
kentucky
in
a
fact
that
told
heavily
in
the
campaign
in
the
ohio
valley
he
was
a
man
of
the
soil
the
son
of
poor
frontier
parents
a
pioneer
who
in
his
youth
had
labored
in
the
fields
and
forests
celebrated
far
and
wide
as
honest
abe
the
it
was
that
he
disliked
slavery
but
was
no
abolitionist
he
had
come
dangerously
near
to
seward
radicalism
in
his
speech
but
he
had
never
committed
himself
to
the
reckless
doctrine
that
there
was
a
higher
law
than
the
constitution
slavery
in
the
south
he
tolerated
as
a
bitter
fact
slavery
in
the
territories
he
opposed
with
all
his
strength
of
his
sincerity
there
could
be
no
doubt
he
was
a
speaker
and
writer
of
singular
power
commanding
by
the
use
of
simple
and
homely
language
the
hearts
and
minds
of
those
who
heard
him
speak
or
read
his
printed
words
he
had
gone
far
enough
in
his
opposition
to
slavery
but
not
too
far
he
was
the
man
of

to
pass
responded
the
governor
of
the
state
the
answer
should
be
a
declaration
of
independence
in
a
few
days
the
suspense
was
over
the
news
of
lincoln
election
came
speeding
along
the
wires
prepared
for
the
event
the
editor
of
the
charleston
unfurled
the
flag
of
his
state
amid
wild
cheers
from
an
excited
throng
in
the
streets
then
he
seized
his
pen
and
wrote
the
tea
has
been
thrown
overboard
the
revolution
of
has
been
initiated
the
issue
was
submitted
to
the
voters
in
the
choice
of
delegates
to
a
state
convention
called
to
cast
off
the
yoke
of
the
constitution
the
southern
confederacy
as
arranged
the
convention
of
south
carolina
assembled
in
december
and
without
a
dissenting
voice
passed
the
ordinance
of
secession
withdrawing
from
the
union
bells
were
rung
exultantly
the
roar
of
cannon
carried
the
news
to
outlying
counties
fireworks
lighted
up
the
heavens
and
champagne
flowed
the
crisis
so
long
expected
had
come
at
last
even
the
conservatives
who
had
prayed
that
they
might
escape
the
dreadful
crash
greeted
it
with
a
sigh
of
relief
illustration
the
united
states
in
the
border
states
in
purple
remained
loyal
south
carolina
now
sent
forth
an
appeal
to
her
sister
states
states
that
had
in
jackson
day
repudiated
nullification
as
leading
to
the
dissolution
of
the
union
the
answer
that
came
this
time
was
in
a
different
vein
a
month
had
hardly
elapsed
before
five
other
states
florida
georgia
alabama
mississippi
and
louisiana
had
withdrawn
from
the
union
in
february
texas
followed
virginia
hesitating
until
the
bombardment
of
fort
sumter
forced
a
conclusion
seceded
in
april
but
of
the
one
hundred
and
delegates
dissented
foreshadowing
the
creation
of
the
new
state
of
west
virginia
which
congress
admitted
to
the
union
in
in
may
north
carolina
arkansas
and
tennessee
announced
their
independence
and
the
theories
of
the
in
severing
their
relations
with
the
union
the
seceding
states
denied
every
point
in
the
northern
theory
of
the
constitution
that
theory
as
every
one
knows
was
carefully
formulated
by
webster
and
elaborated
by
lincoln
according
to
it
the
union
was
older
than
the
states
it
was
created
before
the
declaration
of
independence
for
the
purpose
of
common
defense
the
articles
of
confederation
did
but
strengthen
this
national
bond
and
the
constitution
sealed
it
forever
the
federal
government
was
not
a
creature
of
state
governments
it
was
erected
by
the
people
and
derived
its
powers
directly
from
them
it
is
said
webster
the
constitution
the
people
government
made
for
the
people
made
by
the
people
and
answerable
to
the
people
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
declared
that
this
constitution
shall
be
the
supreme
law
when
a
state
questions
the
lawfulness
of
any
act
of
the
federal
government
it
can
not
nullify
that
act
or
withdraw
from
the
union
it
must
abide
by
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
the
union
of
these
states
is
perpetual
ran
lincoln
simple
argument
in
the
first
inaugural
the
federal
constitution
has
no
provision
for
its
own
termination
it
can
be
destroyed
only
by
some
action
not
provided
for
in
the
instrument
itself
even
if
it
is
a
compact
among
all
the
states
the
consent
of
all
must
be
necessary
to
its
dissolution
therefore
no
state
can
lawfully
get
out
of
the
union
and
acts
of
violence
against
the
united
states
are
insurrectionary
or
revolutionary
this
was
the
system
which
he
believed
himself
bound
to
defend
by
his
oath
of
office
registered
in
heaven
all
this
reasoning
southern
statesmen
utterly
rejected
in
their
opinion
the
thirteen
original
states
won
their
independence
as
separate
and
sovereign
powers
the
treaty
of
peace
with
great
britain
named
them
all
and
acknowledged
them
to
be
free
sovereign
and
independent
states
the
articles
of
confederation
very
explicitly
declared
that
each
state
retains
its
sovereignty
freedom
and
independence
the
constitution
was
a
league
of
nations
formed
by
an
alliance
of
thirteen
separate
powers
each
one
of
which
ratified
the
instrument
before
it
was
put
into
effect
they
voluntarily
entered
the
union
under
the
constitution
and
voluntarily
they
could
leave
it
such
was
the
constitutional
doctrine
of
hayne
calhoun
and
jefferson
davis
in
seceding
the
southern
states
had
only
to
follow
legal
methods
and
the
transaction
would
be
correct
in
every
particular
so
conventions
were
summoned
elections
were
held
and
sovereign
assemblies
of
the
people
set
aside
the
constitution
in
the
same
manner
as
it
had
been
ratified
nearly
four
score
years
before
thus
said
the
southern
people
the
moral
judgment
was
fulfilled
and
the
letter
of
the
law
carried
into
effect

and
on
february
adopted

the
field

war
in
public
office
and
as
a
member
of
congress
in
march
a
permanent
constitution
of
the
confederate
states
was
drafted
it
was
quickly
ratified
by
the
states
elections
were
held
in
november
and
the
government
under
it
went
into
effect
the
next
year
this
new
constitution
in
form
was
very
much
like
the
famous
instrument
drafted
at
philadelphia
in
it
provided
for
a
president
a
senate
and
a
house
of
representatives
along
almost
identical
lines
in
the
powers
conferred
upon
them
however
there
were
striking
differences
the
right
to
appropriate
money
for
internal
improvements
was
expressly
withheld
bounties
were
not
to
be
granted
from
the
treasury
nor
import
duties
so
laid
as
to
promote
or
foster
any
branch
of
industry
the
dignity
of
the
state
if
any
might
be
bold
enough
to
question
it
was
safeguarded
in
the
opening
line
by
the
declaration
that
each
acted
in
its
sovereign
and
independent
character
in
forming
the
southern
union
the
no
government
ever
set
out
upon
its
career
with
more
perplexing
tasks
in
front
of
it
the
north
had
a
monetary
system
the
south
had
to
create
one
the
north
had
a
scheme
of
taxation
that
produced
large
revenues
from
numerous
sources
the
south
had
to
formulate
and
carry
out
a
financial
plan
like
the
north
the
confederacy
expected
to
secure
a
large
revenue
from
customs
duties
easily
collected
and
little
felt
among
the
masses
to
this
expectation
the
blockade
of
southern
ports
inaugurated
by
lincoln
in
april
soon
put
an
end
following
the
precedent
set
by
congress
under
the
articles
of
confederation
the
southern
congress
resorted
to
a
direct
property
tax
apportioned
among
the
states
only
to
meet
the
failure
that
might
have
been
foretold
the
confederacy
also
sold
bonds
the
first
issue
bringing
into
the
treasury
nearly
all
the
specie
available
in
the
southern
banks
this
specie
by
unhappy
management
was
early
sent
abroad
to
pay
for
supplies
sapping
the
foundations
of
a
sound
currency
system
large
amounts
of
bonds
were
sold
overseas
commanding
at
first
better
terms
than
those
of
the
north
in
the
markets
of
london
paris
and
amsterdam
many
an
english
lord
and
statesman
buying
with
enthusiasm
and
confidence
to
lament
within
a
few
years
the
proofs
of
his
folly
the
difficulties
of
bringing
through
the
blockade
any
supplies
purchased
by
foreign
bond
issues
however
nullified
the
effect
of
foreign
credit
and
forced
the
confederacy
back
upon
the
device
of
paper
money
in
all
approximately
one
billion
dollars
streamed
from
the
printing
presses
to
fall
in
value
at
an
alarming
rate
reaching
in
january
the
astounding
figure
of
fifty
dollars
in
paper
money
for
one
in
gold
every
known
device
was
used
to
prevent
its
depreciation
without
result
to
the
issues
of
the
confederate
congress
were
added
untold
millions
poured
out
by
the
states
and
by
private
banks
and
material
when
we
measure
strength
for
strength
in
those
signs
of
power
men
money
and
supplies
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
south
was
able
to
embark
on
secession
and
war
with
such
confidence
in
the
outcome
in
the
confederacy
at
the
final
reckoning
there
were
eleven
states
in
all
to
be
pitted
against
a
population
of
nine
millions
nearly
servile
to
be
pitted
against
millions
a
land
without
great
industries
to
produce
war
supplies
and
without
vast
capital
to
furnish
war
finances
joined
in
battle
with
a
nation
already
industrial
and
fortified
by
property
worth
eleven
billion
dollars
even
after
the
confederate
congress
authorized
conscription
in
southern
man
power
measured
in
numbers
was
wholly
inadequate
to
uphold
the
independence
which
had
been
declared
how
therefore
could
the
confederacy
hope
to
sustain
itself
against
such
a
combination
of
men
money
and
materials
as
the
north
could
marshal
the
answer
to
this
question
is
to
be
found
in
the
ideas
that
prevailed
among
southern
leaders
first
of
all
they
hoped
in
vain
to
carry
the
confederacy
up
to
the
ohio
river
and
with
the
aid
of
missouri
to
gain
possession
of
the
mississippi
valley
the
granary
of
the
nation
in
the
second
place
they
reckoned
upon
a
large
and
continuous
trade
with
great
britain
the
exchange
of
cotton
for
war
materials
they
likewise
expected
to
receive
recognition
and
open
aid
from
european
powers
that
looked
with
satisfaction
upon
the
breakup
of
the
great
american
republic
in
the
third
place
they
believed
that
their
control
over
several
staples
so
essential
to
northern
industry
would
enable
them
to
bring
on
an
industrial
crisis
in
the
manufacturing
states
i
firmly
believe
wrote
senator
hammond
of
south
carolina
in
that
the
south
is
now
the
controlling
power
of
the
world
that
no
other
power
would
face
us
in
hostility
cotton
rice
tobacco
and
naval
stores
command
the
world
and
we
have
the
sense
to
know
it
and
are
sufficiently
teutonic
to
carry
it
out
successfully
the
north
without
us
would
be
a
motherless
calf
bleating
about
and
die
of
mange
and
starvation
there
were
other
grounds
for
confidence
having
seized
all
of
the
federal
military
and
naval
supplies
in
the
south
and
having
left
the
national
government
weak
in
armed
power
during
their
possession
of
the
presidency
southern
leaders
looked
to
a
swift
war
if
it
came
at
all
to
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
independence
the
greasy
mechanics
of
the
north
it
was
repeatedly
said
will
not
fight
as
to
disparity
in
numbers
they
drew
historic
parallels
our
fathers
a
mere
handful
overcame
the
enormous
power
of
great
britain
a
saying
of
tyler
ran
current
to
reassure
the
doubtful
finally
and
this
point
can
not
be
too
strongly
emphasized
the
south
expected
to
see
a
weakened
and
divided
north
it
knew
that
the
abolitionists
and
the
southern
sympathizers
were
ready
to
let
the
confederate
states
go
in
peace
that
lincoln
represented
only
a
little
more
than
the
voters
of
the
country
and
that
the
vote
for
douglas
bell
and
breckinridge
meant
a
decided
opposition
to
the
republicans
and
their
policies
at
republican
leaders
on
reviewing
the
same
facts
were
themselves
uncertain
as
to
the
outcome
of
a
civil
war
and
made
many
efforts
to
avoid
a
crisis
thurlow
weed
an
albany
journalist
and
politician
who
had
done
much
to
carry
new
york
for
lincoln
proposed
a
plan
for
extending
the
missouri
compromise
line
to
the
pacific
jefferson
davis
warning
his
followers
that
a
war
if
it
came
would
be
terrible
was
prepared
to
accept
the
offer
but
lincoln
remembering
his
campaign
pledges
stood
firm
as
a
rock
against
it
his
followers
in
congress
took
the
same
position
with
regard
to
a
similar
settlement
suggested
by
senator
crittenden
of
kentucky
though
unwilling
to
surrender
his
solemn
promises
respecting
slavery
in
the
territories
lincoln
was
prepared
to
give
to
southern
leaders
a
strong
guarantee
that
his
administration
would
not
interfere
directly
or
indirectly
with
slavery
in
the
states
anxious
to
reassure
the
south
on
this
point
the
republicans
in
congress
proposed
to
write
into
the
constitution
a
declaration
that
no
amendment
should
ever
be
made
authorizing
the
abolition
of
or
interference
with
slavery
in
any
state
the
resolution
duly
passed
was
sent
forth
on
march
with
the
approval
of
lincoln
it
was
actually
ratified
by
three
states
before
the
storm
of
war
destroyed
it
by
the
irony
of
fate
the
thirteenth
amendment
was
to
abolish
not
guarantee
slavery
the
war
measures
of
the
federal
government
the
the
crisis
at
fort
sumter
on
april
forced
the
president
and
congress
to
turn
from
negotiations
to
problems
of
warfare
little
did
they
realize
the
magnitude
of
the
task
before
them
lincoln
first
call
for
volunteers
issued
on
april
limited
the
number
to
put
their
term
of
service
at
three
months
and
prescribed
their
duty
as
the
enforcement
of
the
law
against
combinations
too
powerful
to
be
overcome
by
ordinary
judicial
process
disillusionment
swiftly
followed
the
terrible
defeat
of
the
federals
at
bull
run
on
july
revealed
the
serious
character
of
the
task
before
them
and
by
a
series
of
measures
congress
put
the
entire
man
power
of
the
country
at
the
president
command
under
these
acts
he
issued
new
calls
for
volunteers
early
in
august
he
ordered
a
draft
of
militiamen
numbering
for
nine
months
service
the
results
were
disappointing
ominous
for
only
about
soldiers
were
added
to
the
army
something
more
drastic
was
clearly
necessary
in
march
lincoln
signed
the
inevitable
draft
law
it
enrolled
in
the
national
forces
liable
to
military
duty
all
male
citizens
and
persons
of
foreign
birth
who
had
declared
their
intention
to
become
citizens
between
the
ages
of
twenty
and
years
with
exemptions
on
grounds
of
physical
weakness
and
dependency
from
the
men
enrolled
were
drawn
by
lot
those
destined
to
active
service
unhappily
the
measure
struck
a
mortal
blow
at
the
principle
of
universal
liability
by
excusing
any
person
who
found
a
substitute
for
himself
or
paid
into
the
war
office
a
sum
not
exceeding
three
hundred
dollars
to
be
fixed
by
general
order
this
provision
so
crass
and
so
obviously
favoring
the
sowed
seeds
of
bitterness
which
sprang
up
a
hundredfold
in
the
north
illustration
the
draft
riots
in
new
york
city
the
beginning
of
the
drawings
under
the
draft
act
in
new
york
city
on
monday
july
was
the
signal
for
four
days
of
rioting
in
the
course
of
this
uprising
draft
headquarters
were
destroyed
the
office
of
the
was
gutted
negroes
were
seized
hanged
and
shot
the
homes
of
obnoxious
unionists
were
burned
down
the
residence
of
the
mayor
of
the
city
was
attacked
and
regular
battles
were
fought
in
the
streets
between
the
rioters
and
the
police
business
stopped
and
a
large
part
of
the
city
passed
absolutely
into
the
control
of
the
mob
not
until
late
the
following
wednesday
did
enough
troops
arrive
to
restore
order
and
enable
the
residents
of
the
city
to
resume
their
daily
activities
at
least
a
thousand
people
had
been
killed
or
wounded
and
more
than
a
million
dollars
worth
of
damage
done
to
property
the
draft
temporarily
interrupted
by
this
outbreak
was
then
resumed
and
carried
out
without
further
trouble
the
results
of
the
draft
were
in
the
end
distinctly
disappointing
to
the
government
the
exemptions
were
numerous
and
the
number
who
preferred
and
were
able
to
pay
rather
than
serve
exceeded
all
expectations
volunteering
it
is
true
was
stimulated
but
even
that
resource
could
hardly
keep
the
thinning
ranks
of
the
army
filled
with
reluctance
congress
struck
out
the
exemption
clause
but
still
favored
the
by
allowing
them
to
hire
substitutes
if
they
could
find
them
with
all
this
power
in
its
hands
the
administration
was
able
by
january
to
construct
a
union
army
that
outnumbered
the
confederates
two
to
one
in
the
financial
sphere
the
north
faced
immense
difficulties
the
surplus
in
the
treasury
had
been
dissipated
by
and
the
tariff
of
had
failed
to
produce
an
income
sufficient
to
meet
the
ordinary
expenses
of
the
government
confronted
by
military
and
naval
expenditures
of
appalling
magnitude
rising
from
in
the
first
year
of
the
war
to
in
the
last
year
the
administration
had
to
tap
every
available
source
of
income
the
duties
on
imports
were
increased
not
once
but
many
times
producing
huge
revenues

the

against

this
step
was
early
and
repeatedly
suggested
to
lincoln
by
the
abolitionists
but
was
steadily
put
aside
he
knew
that
the
abolitionists
were
a
mere
handful
that
emancipation
might
drive
the
border
states
into
secession
and
that
the
northern
soldiers
had
enlisted
to
save
the

he
had
before
him
a
solemn
resolution
passed

the
sole
purpose
of
the

to
be
the
salvation

any
intention

the
federal

though
pledged

the
preservation
of

soon
found
itself
beaten
back
upon
its
course

out
upon
a
new
tack
before
a

had
elapsed

on

congress
resolved
that
financial
aid
should
be
given
to
any
state
that
might
adopt

he
had
come
to
his
great
decision
near
the
end
of
that

he
read
to
his
cabinet
the
draft
of
a
proclamation
of
emancipation
but
he
laid
it
aside
until

military
achievement
would
make
it
something
more
than

idle
gesture

in

returned
to

by

the
fatal
blow
at
their
peculiar
institution
would
be
delivered
southern
leaders
treated
it
with
slight
regard
and
so
on
the
date
set
the
promise
was
fulfilled
the
proclamation
was
issued
as
a
war
measure
adopted
by
the
president
as
of
the

to

all
those
sentiments

sweetness
and
strength
which
are
the
finest

of
culture
throughout
the

quiet
answer
wide
were
the
dissensions
in
the
north
during
that
year
and
the
republicans
while
selecting
lincoln
as
their
candidate
again
cast
off
their
old
name
and
chose
the
simple
title
of

they

man
andrew

to
be

this
combination
the
northern

boldly
confronted
with
a
platform
declaring
that
after
four
years
of
failure
to
restore
the
union
by
the
experiment
of
war
during
which
under
the
pretence
of
military
necessity
or
war
power
higher
than
the

the
constitution
itself
has
been
disregarded
in

part
and

alike
trodden
down

demand
that
immediate
efforts
be
made

cessation
of

to
the
end
that
peace
may
be
restored
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
union
of
the
states
it
is
true
that
the
democratic
candidate
general
mcclellan
sought
to
break
the
yoke
imposed
upon
him
by
the
platform
saying
that
he
could
not
look
his
old
comrades
in
the
face
and
pronounce
their
efforts
vain
but
the
party
call
to
the
nation
to
repudiate
lincoln
and
his
works
had
gone
forth
the
response
came
giving
lincoln
votes
against
for
his
opponent
the
bitter
things
said
about
him
during
the
campaign
he
forgot
and
forgave
when
in
april
he
was
struck
down
by
the
assassin
hand
he
above
all
others
in
washington
was
planning
measures
of
moderation
and
healing
the
results
of
the
civil
war
there
is
a
strong
and
natural
tendency
on
the
part
of
writers
to
stress
the
dramatic
and
heroic
aspects
of
war
but
the
long
judgment
of
history
requires
us
to
include
all
other
significant
phases
as
well
like
every
great
armed
conflict
the
civil
war
outran
the
purposes
of
those
who
took
part
in
it
waged
over
the
nature
of

it

and

supremacy
of
the
first
and
foremost
the
war
settled
for
all
time
the
long
dispute
as
to
the
nature
of
the
federal
system
the
doctrine
of
state
sovereignty
was
laid
to
rest
men
might
still
speak
of
the
rights
of
states
and
think
of
their
commonwealths
with
affection
but
nullification
and
secession
were
destroyed
the
nation
was
supreme
destruction
of
the
slave
next
to
the
vindication
of
national
supremacy
was
the
destruction
of
the
planting
aristocracy
of
the
south
that
great
power
which
had
furnished
leadership
of
undoubted
ability
and
had
so
long
contested
with
the
industrial
and
commercial
interests
of
the
north
the
first
paralyzing
blow
at
the
planters
was
struck
by
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
second
and
third
came
with
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
giving
the
ballot
to
freedmen
and
excluding
from

the
confederate

driving
from
the
work
of
reconstruction
the
finest
talents
of
the
south
as
if
to
add
bitterness
to
gall
and
wormwood
the
fourteenth
amendment
forbade
the
united
states
or
any
state
to
pay
any
debts
incurred
in
aid
of
the
confederacy
or
in
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
plunging
into
utter
bankruptcy
the
southern
financiers
who
had
stripped
their
section
of
capital
to
support
their
cause
so
the
southern
planters
found
themselves
excluded
from
public
office
and
ruled
over
by
their
former
bondmen
under
the
tutelage
of
republican
leaders
their
labor
system
was
wrecked
and
their
money
and
bonds
were
as
worthless
as
waste
paper
the
south
was
subject
to
the
north
that
which
neither
the
federalists
nor
the
whigs
had
been
able
to
accomplish
in
the
realm
of
statecraft
was
accomplished
on
the
field
of
battle
triumph
of
the
wreck
of
the
planting
system
was
accompanied
by
a
mighty
upswing
of
northern
industry
which
made
the
old
whigs
of
massachusetts
and
pennsylvania
stare
in
wonderment
the
demands
of
the
federal
government
for
manufactured
goods
at
unrestricted
prices
gave
a
stimulus
to
business
which
more
than
replaced
the
lost
markets
of
the
south
between
and
the
number
of
manufacturing
establishments
increased
per
cent
as
against
for
the
previous
decade
while
the
number
of
persons
employed
almost
doubled

was
no

about
the
future
of

for
the

moreover
it
was
henceforth
to
be
well
protected
for
many
years
before
the

the
friends
of
protection
had
been
on
the
defensive
the
tariff
act
of
imposed
duties
so
low
as
to
presage
a
tariff
for
revenue
only
the
war
changed
all
that
the
extraordinary
military
expenditures
requiring
heavy
taxes
on
all
sources
justified
tariffs
so
high
that
a
follower
of
clay
or
webster
might
well
have
gasped
with
astonishment
after
the
war
was
over
the

remained
and
both
interest
and
principal
had
to
be
paid
protective
arguments
based
on
economic
reasoning
were
supported
by
a
plain
necessity
for
revenue
which
admitted
no
dispute
liberal
immigration
linked
with
industry
was
the
labor
supply
the
problem
of
manning
industries
became
a
pressing
matter
and
republican
leaders
grappled
with
it
in
the
platform
of
the
union
party
adopted
in
it
was
declared
that
foreign
immigration
which
in
the
past
has
added
so
much
to
the
wealth
the
development
of
resources
and
the
increase
of
power
to
this
nation
the
asylum
of
the
oppressed
of
all
nations
should
be
fostered
and
encouraged
by
a
liberal
and
just
policy
in
that
very
year
congress
recognizing
the
importance
of
the
problem
passed
a
measure
of
high
significance
creating
a
bureau
of
immigration
and
authorizing
a
modified
form
of
indentured
labor
by
making
it
legal
for
immigrants
to
pledge
their
wages
in
advance
to
pay
their
passage
over
though
the
bill
was
soon
repealed
the
practice
authorized
by
it
was
long
continued
the
cheapness
of
the
passage
shortened
the
term
of
service
but
the
principle
was
older
than
the
days
of
william
penn
homestead
act
of
in
the
immigration
measure
guaranteeing
a
continuous
and
adequate
labor
supply
the
manufacturers
saw
an
offset
to
the
homestead
act
of
granting
free
lands
to
settlers
the
homestead
law
they
had
resisted
in
a
long
and
bitter
congressional
battle
naturally
they
had
not
taken
kindly
to
a
scheme
which
lured
men
away
from
the
factories
or
enabled
them
to
make
unlimited
demands
for
higher
wages
as
the
price
of
remaining
southern
planters
likewise
had
feared
free
homesteads
for
the
very
good
reason
that
they
only
promised
to
add
to
the
overbalancing
power
of
the
north
in
spite
of
the
opposition
supporters
of
a
liberal
land
policy
made
steady
gains
democrats
jacksonian
farmers
and
mechanics
labor
reformers
and
political
leaders
like
stephen
douglas
of
illinois
and
andrew
johnson
of
tennessee
kept
up
the
agitation
in
season
and
out
more
than
once
were
they
able
to
force
a
homestead
bill
through
the
house
of
representatives
only
to
have
it
blocked
in
the
senate
where
southern
interests
were
intrenched
then
after
the
senate
was
won
over
a
democratic
president
james
buchanan
vetoed
the
bill
still
the
issue
lived
the
republicans
strong
among
the
farmers
of
the
northwest
favored
it
from
the
beginning
and
pressed
it
upon
the
attention
of
the
country
finally
the
manufacturers
yielded
they
received
their
compensation
in
the
contract
labor
law
in
congress
provided
for
the
free
distribution
of
land
in
lots
among
men
and
women
of
strong
arms
and
willing
hearts
ready
to
build
their
serried
lines
of
homesteads
to
the
rockies
and
beyond
if
farmers
and
manufacturers
were
early
divided
on
the
matter
of
free
homesteads
the
same
could
hardly
be
said
of
internal
improvements
the
western
tiller
of
the
soil
was
as
eager
for
some
easy
way
of
sending
his
produce
to
market
as
the
manufacturer
was
for
the
same
means
to
transport
his
goods
to
the
consumer
on
the
farm
while
the
confederate
leaders
were
writing
into
their
constitution
a
clause
forbidding
all
appropriations
for
internal
improvements
the
republican
leaders
at
washington
were
planning
such
expenditures
from
the
treasury
in
the
form
of
public
land
grants
to
railways
as
would
have
dazed
the
authors
of
the
national
road
bill
half
a
century
earlier
finance
national
from
hamilton
day
to
lincoln
business
men
in
the
east
had
contended
for
a
sound
system
of
national
currency
the
experience
of
the
states
with
paper
money
painfully
impressive
in
the
years
before
the
framing
of
the
constitution
had
been
convincing
to
those
who
understood
the
economy
of
business
the
constitution
as
we
have
seen
bore
the
signs
of
this
experience
states
were
forbidden
to
emit
bills
of
credit
paper
money
in
short
this
provision
stood
clear
in
the
document
but
judicial
ingenuity
had
circumvented
it
in
the
age
of
jacksonian
democracy
the
states
had
enacted
and
the
supreme
court
after
the
death
of
john
marshall
had
sustained
laws
chartering
banking
companies
and
authorizing
them
to
issue
paper
money
so
the
country
was
beset
by
the
old
curse
the
banks
of
western
and
southern
states
issuing
reams
of
paper
notes
to
help
borrowers
pay
their
debts
in
dealing
with
war
finances
the
republicans
attacked
this
ancient
evil
by
act
of
congress
in
they
authorized
a
series
of
national
banks
founded
on
the
credit
of
government
bonds
and
empowered
to
issue
notes
the
next
year
they
stopped
all
bank
paper
sent
forth
under
the
authority
of
the
states
by
means
of
a
prohibitive
tax
in
this
way
by
two
measures
congress
restored
federal
control
over
the
monetary
system
although
it
did
not
reëstablish
the
united
states
bank
so
hated
by
jacksonian
democracy
of

rights
by
fourteenth
these
acts
and
others
not
cited
here
were
measures
of
centralization
and
consolidation
at
the
expense
of
the
powers
and
dignity
of
the
states
they
were
all
of
high
import
but
the
crowning
act
of
nationalism
was
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
among
other
things
forbade
states
to
deprive
any
person
of
life
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
the
immediate
occasion
though
not
the
actual
cause
of
this
provision
was
the
need
for
protecting
the
rights
of
freedmen
against
hostile
legislatures
in
the
south
the
result
of
the
amendment
as
was
prophesied
in
protests
loud
and
long
from
every
quarter
of
the
democratic
party
was
the
subjection
of
every
act
of
state
municipal
and
county
authorities
to
possible
annulment
by
the
supreme
court
at
washington
the
expected
happened
few
negroes
ever
brought
cases
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
attention
of
the
courts
but
thousands
of
state
laws
municipal
ordinances
and
acts
of
local
authorities
were
set
aside
as
null
and
void
under
it
laws
of
states
regulating
railway
rates
fixing
hours
of
labor
in
bakeshops
and
taxing
corporations
were
in
due
time
to
be
annulled
as
conflicting
with
an
amendment
erroneously
supposed
to
be
designed
solely
for
the
protection
of
negroes
as
centralized
power
over
tariffs
railways
public
lands
and
other
national
concerns
went
to
congress
so
centralized
power
over
the
acts
of
state
and
local
authorities
involving
an
infringement
of
personal
and
property
rights
was
conferred
on
the
federal
judiciary
the
apex
of
which
was
the
supreme
court
at
washington
thus
the
old
federation
of
independent
states
all
equal
in
rights
and
dignity
each
wearing
the
jewel
of
sovereignty
so
celebrated
in
southern
oratory

gone
the
way
of
all
flesh
under
the
withering
blasts
of

in
the

had
been
for
some
time
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
the
members
of
the
former
confederacy
radical
republicans
held
that
they
were
conquered
provinces
at
the
mercy
of
congress
to
be
governed
under
such
laws
as
it
saw
fit
to
enact
and
until
in
its
wisdom
it
decided
to
readmit
any
or
all
of
them
to
the
union
men
of
more
conservative
views
held
that
as
the
war
had
been
waged
by
the
north
on
the
theory
that
no
state
could
secede
from
the
union
the
confederate
states
had
merely
attempted
to
withdraw
and
had
failed
the
corollary
of
this
latter
line
of
argument
was
simple
the
southern
states
are
still
in
the
union
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
president
as
to
remove
the
federal
troops
as
soon
as
order
is
restored
and
the
state
governments
ready
to
function
once
more
as
usual
some
such
simple
and
conservative
form
of
reconstruction
had
been
suggested
by
lincoln
in
a
proclamation
of
december
he
proposed
pardon
and
a
restoration
of
property
except
in
slaves
to
nearly
all
who
had
directly
or
by
implication
participated
in
the
existing
rebellion
on
condition
that
they
take
an
oath
of
loyalty
to
the
union
he
then
announced
that
when
in
any
of
the
states
named
a
body
of
voters
qualified
under
the
law
as
it
stood
before
secession
and
equal
in
number
to
the
votes
cast
in
took
the
oath
of
allegiance
they
should
be
permitted
to
reëstablish
a
state
government
such
a
government
he
added
should
be
recognized
as
a
lawful
authority
and
entitled
to
protection
under
the
federal
constitution
with
reference
to
the
status
of
the
former
slaves
lincoln
made
it
clear
that
while
their
freedom
must
be
recognized
he
would
not
object
to
any
legislation
which
may
yet
be
consistent
as
a
temporary
arrangement
with
their
present
condition
as
a
laboring
landless
and
homeless
class
johnson
plan
his
lincoln
successor
andrew
johnson
the
vice
president
soon
after
taking
office
proposed
to
pursue
a
somewhat
similar
course
in
a
number
of
states
he
appointed
military
governors
instructing
them
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
to
assemble
conventions
chosen
by
that
portion
of
the
people
of
the
said
states
who
are
loyal
to
the
united
states
and
proceed
to
the
organization
of
regular
civil
government
johnson
a
southern
man
and
a
democrat
was
immediately
charged
by
the
republicans
with
being
too
ready
to
restore
the
southern
states
as
the
months
went
by
the
opposition
to
his
measures
and
policies
in
congress
grew
in
size
and
bitterness
the
contest
resulted
in
the
impeachment
of
johnson
by
the
house
of
representatives
in
march
and
his
acquittal
by
the
senate
merely
because
his
opponents
lacked
one
vote
of
the
required
for
conviction
enacts
reconstruction
laws
in
fact
congress
was
in
a
strategic
position
it
was
the
body
and
it
could
moreover
determine
the
conditions
under
which
senators
and
representatives
from
the
south
were
to
be
readmitted
it
therefore
proceeded
to
pass
a
series
of
reconstruction
acts
carrying
all
of
them
over
johnson
veto
these
measures
the
first
of
which
became
a
law
on
march
betrayed
an
animus
not
found
anywhere
in
lincoln
plans
or
johnson
proclamations
they
laid
off
the
ten
states
the
whole
confederacy
with
the
exception
of
tennessee
still
outside
the
pale
into
five
military
districts
each
commanded
by
a
military
officer
appointed
by
the
president
they
ordered
the
commanding
general
to
prepare
a
register
of
voters
for
the
election
of
delegates
to
conventions
chosen
for
the
purpose
of
drafting
new
constitutions
such
voters
however
were
not
to
be
as
lincoln
had
suggested
loyal
persons
duly
qualified
under
the
law
existing
before
secession
but
the
male
citizens
of
said
state
years
old
and
upward
of
whatever
race
color
or
previous
condition
except
such
as
may
be
disfranchised
for
participation
in
the
rebellion
or
for
felony
at
common
law
this
was
the
death
knell
to
the
idea
that
the
leaders
of
the
confederacy
and
their
white
supporters
might
be
permitted
to
share
in
the
establishment
of
the
new
order
power
was
thus
arbitrarily
thrust
into
the
hands
of
the
newly
emancipated
male
negroes
and
the
handful
of
whites
who
could
show
a
record
of
loyalty
that
was
not
all
each
state
was
under
the
reconstruction
acts
compelled
to
ratify
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
as
a
price
of
restoration
to
the
union
the
composition
of
the
conventions
thus
authorized
may
be
imagined
bondmen
without
the
asking
and
without
preparation
found
themselves
the
governing
power
an
army
of
adventurers
from
the
north
carpet
baggers
as
they
were
called
poured
in
upon
the
scene
to
aid
in
reconstruction
undoubtedly
many
men
of
honor
and
fine
intentions
gave
unstinted
service
but
the
results
of
their
deliberations
only
aggravated
the
open
wound
left
by
the
war
any
number
of
political
doctors
offered
their
prescriptions
but
no
effective
remedy
could
be
found
under
measures
admittedly
open
to
grave
objections
the
southern
states
were
one
after
another
restored
to
the
union
by
the
grace
of
congress
the
last
one
in
even
this
grudging
concession
of
the
formalities
of
statehood
did
not
mean
a
full
restoration
of
honors
and
privileges
the
last
soldier
was
not
withdrawn
from
the
last
southern
capital
until
and
federal
control
over
elections
long
remained
as
a
sign
of
congressional
supremacy
status
of
the
even
more
intricate
than
the
issues
involved
in
restoring
the
seceded
states
to
the
union
was
the
question
of
what
to
do
with
the
newly
emancipated
slaves
that
problem
often
put
to
abolitionists
before
the
war
had
become
at
last
a
real
concern
the
thirteenth
amendment
abolishing
slavery
had
not
touched
it
at
all
it
declared
bondmen
free
but
did
nothing
to
provide
them
with
work
or
homes
and
did
not
mention
the
subject
of
political
rights
all
these
matters
were
left
to
the
states
and
the
legislatures
of
some
of
them
by
their
famous
black
codes
restored
a
form
of
servitude
under
the
guise
of
vagrancy
and
apprentice
laws
such
methods
were
in
fact
partly
responsible
for
the
reaction
that
led
congress
to
abandon
policies
and
undertake
its
own
program
of
reconstruction
still
no
extensive
effort
was
made
to
solve
by
law
the
economic
problems
of
the
bondmen
radical
abolitionists
had
advocated
that
the
slaves
when
emancipated
should
be
given
outright
the
fields
of
their
former
masters
but
congress
steadily
rejected
the
very
idea
of
confiscation
the
necessity
of
immediate
assistance
it
recognized
by
creating
in
the
freedmen
bureau
to
take
care
of
refugees
it
authorized
the
issue
of
food
and
clothing
to
the
destitute
and
the
renting
of
abandoned
and
certain
other
lands
under
federal
control
to
former
slaves
at
reasonable
rates
but
the
larger
problem
of
the
relation
of
the
freedmen
to
the
land
it
left
to
the
slow
working
of
time
against
sharp
protests
from
conservative
men
particularly
among
the
democrats
congress
did
insist
however
on
conferring
upon
the
freedmen
certain
rights
by
national
law
these
rights
fell
into
broad
divisions
civil
and
political
by
an
act
passed
in
congress
gave
to
former
slaves
the
rights
of
white
citizens
in
the
matter
of
making
contracts
giving
testimony
in
courts
and
purchasing
selling
and
leasing
property
as
it
was
doubtful
whether
congress
had
the
power
to
enact
this
law
there
was
passed
and
submitted
to
the
states
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
gave
citizenship
to
the
freedmen
assured
them
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
declared
that
no
state
should
deprive
any
person
of
his
life
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
not
yet
satisfied
congress
attempted
to
give
social
equality
to
negroes
by
the
second
civil
rights
bill
of
which
promised
to
them
among
other
things
the
full
and
equal
enjoyment
of
inns
theaters
public
conveyances
and
places
of
amusement
a
law
later
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
supreme
court
the
matter
of
political
rights
was
even
more
hotly
contested
but
the
radical
republicans
like
charles
sumner
asserted
that
civil
rights
were
not
secure
unless
supported
by
the
suffrage
in
this
same
fourteenth
amendment
they
attempted
to
guarantee
the
ballot
to
all
negro
men
leaving
the
women
to
take
care
of
themselves
the
amendment
declared
in
effect
that
when
any
state
deprived
adult
male
citizens
of
the
right
to
vote
its
representation
in
congress
should
be
reduced
in
the
proportion
such
persons
bore
to
the
voting
population
this
provision
having
failed
to
accomplish
its
purpose
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
passed
and
ratified
expressly
declaring
that
no
citizen
should
be
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
color
or
previous
condition
of
servitude
to
make
assurance
doubly
secure
congress
enacted
in
and
three
drastic
laws
sometimes
known
as
force
bills
providing
for
the
use
of
federal
authorities
civil
and
military
in
supervising
elections
in
all
parts
of
the
union
so
the
federal
government
having
destroyed
chattel
slavery
sought
by
legal
decree
to
sweep
away
all
its
signs
and
badges
civil
social
and
political
never
save
perhaps
in
some
of
the
civil
conflicts
of
greece
or
rome
had
there
occurred
in
the
affairs
of
a
nation
a
social
revolution
so
complete
so
drastic
and
in
its
results
summary
of
the
sectional
conflict
just
as
the
united
states
under
the
impetus
of
western
enterprise
rounded
out
the
continental
domain
its
very
existence
as
a
nation
was
challenged
by
a
fratricidal
conflict
between
two
sections
this
storm
had
been
long
gathering
upon
the
horizon
from
the
very
beginning
in
colonial
times
there
had
been
a
marked
difference
between
the
south
and
the
north
the
former
by
climate
and
soil
was
dedicated
to
a
planting
system
the
cultivation
of
tobacco
rice
cotton
and
sugar
cane
and
in
the
course
of
time
slave
labor
became
the
foundation
of
the
system
the
north
on
the
other
hand
supplemented
agriculture
by
commerce
trade
and
manufacturing
slavery
though
lawful
did
not
flourish
there
an
abundant
supply
of
free
labor
kept
the
northern
wheels
turning
this
difference
between
the
two
sections
early
noted
by
close
observers
was
increased
with
the
advent
of
the
steam
engine
and
the
factory
system
between
and
an
industrial
revolution
took
place
in
the
north
its
signs
were
gigantic
factories
huge
aggregations
of
industrial
workers
immense
cities
a
flourishing
commerce
and
prosperous
banks
finding
an
unfavorable
reception
in
the
south
the
new
industrial
system
was
confined
mainly
to
the
north
by
canals

railways

and
eastern
credit
sustained
western
enterprise
in
time
the
industrial
north
and
the
planting
south
evolved
different
ideas
of
political
policy
the
former
looked
with
favor
on
protective
tariffs
ship
subsidies
a
sound
national
banking
system
and
internal
improvements
the
farmers
of
the
west
demanded
that
the
public
domain
be
divided
up
into
free
homesteads
for
farmers
the
south
steadily
swung
around
to
the
opposite
view
its
spokesmen
came
to
regard
most
of
these
policies
as
injurious
to
the
planting
interests
the
economic
questions
were
all
involved
in
a
moral
issue
the
northern
states
in
which
slavery
was
of
slight
consequence
had
early
abolished
the
institution
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
there
appeared
uncompromising
advocates
of
universal
emancipation
far
and
wide
the
agitation
spread
the
south
was
thoroughly
frightened
it
demanded
protection
against
the
agitators
the
enforcement
of
its
rights
in
the
case
of
runaway
slaves
and
equal
privileges
for
slavery
in

new

with
the
passing
years
the
conflict
between
the
two
sections
increased
in
bitterness

flamed
up
in
and
was
allayed
by
the
missouri

it
took

and
traditions
of
the
south
the
south
at
the
close
of
the
war
ruling
class
as
the
sovereignty
of
the
planters
had
been
the
striking
feature
of
the
old
régime
so
their
ruin
was
the
outstanding
fact
of
the
new
the
situation
was
extraordinary
the
american
revolution
was
carried
out
by
people
experienced
in
the
arts
of
and
at
its
close
they
were
free
to
follow
the
general
course
to
which
they
had
long
been
accustomed
the
french
revolution
witnessed
the
overthrow
of
the
clergy
and
the
nobility
but
middle
classes
who
took
their
places
had
been
steadily
rising
in
intelligence
and
wealth
the
southern
revolution
was
unlike
either
of
these
cataclysms
it
was
not
brought
about
by
a
social
upheaval
but
by
an
external
crisis
it
did
not
enfranchise
a
class
that
sought
and
understood
power
but
bondmen
who
had
played
no
part
in
the
struggle
moreover
it
struck
down
a
class
equipped
to
rule
the
leading
planters
were
almost
to
a
man
excluded
from
state
and
federal
offices
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
a
bar
to
their
return
all
civil
and
military
places
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
states
were
closed
to
every
man
who
had
taken
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
as
a
member
of
congress
as
a
state
legislator
or
as
a
state
or
federal
officer
and
afterward
engaged
in
insurrection
or
rebellion
or
given
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemies
of
the
united
states
this
sweeping
provision
supplemented
by
the
reconstruction
acts
laid
under
the
ban
most
of
the
talent
energy
and
spirit
of
the
south
condition
of
the
state
the
legislative
executive
and
judicial
branches
of
the
state
governments
thus
passed
into
the
control
of
former
slaves
led
principally
by
northern
adventurers
or
southern
novices
known
as
scalawags
the
result
was
a
carnival
of
waste
folly
and
corruption
the
reconstruction
assembly
of
south
carolina
bought
clocks
at
apiece
and
chandeliers
at
to
purchase
land
for
former
bondmen
the
sum
of
was
appropriated
and
swamps
bought
at
cents
an
acre
were
sold
to
the
state
at
five
times
the
cost
in
the
years
between
and
the
debt
of
the
state
rose
from
about
to
and
millions
of
the
increase
could
not
be
accounted
for
by
the
authorities
responsible
for
it
ruin
urban
and
no

where
southern

turned

they
found
devastation

been
partially

charleston
was
described
by
a
visitor
as
a
city
of
ruins
of
desolation
of
vacant
houses
of
rotten

of
deserted

those
who
journeyed
through
the

about
the
same
time
reported
desolation
equally
widespread
and
equally
pathetic
an
english
traveler
who
made
his

along
the
course
of
the
tennessee
river
in
wrote
the
trail
of

is
visible
throughout
the
valley
in
gin
houses
ruined
bridges
mills
and
factories
and
large
tracts
of
once
cultivated
land
are
stripped
of
every
vestige
of
fencing
the
roads
long
neglected
are
in
disorder
and
having
in
many
places
become
impassable
new
tracks
have
been
made
through
the
woods
and
fields
without
much
respect
to
boundaries
many
a
great
plantation
had
been
confiscated
by
the
federal
authorities
while
the
owner
was
in
confederate
service

more

in
waste
in
the
wake
of
the

the

alike
if
spared
the
torch

been
despoiled
of
the
stock
and

necessary
to
renew
agriculture
transportation
was
still
more
demoralized
this
is
revealed
in
the
pages
of
congressional
reports
based
upon
investigations
one
eloquent
passage
illustrates
all
the
rest
from
pocahontas
to
decatur
alabama
a
distance
of
miles
we
are
told
the
railroad
was
almost
entirely
destroyed

the

they
were
in
a
very
bad
condition

forty
miles
of

burned
the
entirely
destroyed
and
the

bent
and
twisted
in
such
a
manner
as
to
require
great

to

and
a
large
portion
of
them
requiring
renewal
and
credit
the
fluid
capital
of
the
south
money
and
credit
was
in
the
same
prostrate
condition
as
the
material
capital
the
confederate
currency
inflated
to
the
bursting
point
had
utterly
collapsed
and
was
as
worthless
as
waste
paper
the
bonds
of
the
confederate
government
were
equally
valueless
specie
had
nearly
disappeared
from
circulation
the
fourteenth

to
the

obtained
in

courts
the
restoration
of
white
supremacy
in
both
politics
and
economics
the
process
of
reconstruction
in
the
south
was
slow
and
arduous
the
first
battle
in
the
political
contest
for
white
supremacy
was
won
outside
the
halls
of
legislatures
and
the
courts
of
law
it
was
waged
in
the
main
by
secret
organizations
among
which
the
ku
klux
klan
and
the
white
camelia
were
the
most
prominent
the
first
of
these
societies
appeared
in
tennessee
in
and
held
its
first
national
convention
the
following
year
it
was
in
origin
a
social
club
according
to
its
announcement
its
objects
were
to
protect
the
weak
the
innocent
and
the
defenceless
from
the
indignities
wrongs
and
outrages
of
the
lawless
the
violent
and
the
brutal
and
to
succor
the
suffering
especially
the
widows
and
orphans
of
the
confederate
soldiers
the
whole
south
was
called
the
empire
and
was
ruled
by
a
grand
wizard
each
state
was
a
realm
and
each
county
a
province
in
the
secret
orders
there
were
enrolled
over
half
a
million
men
the
methods
of
the
ku
klux
and
the
white
camelia
were
similar
solemn
parades
of
masked
men
on
horses
decked
in
long
robes
were
held
sometimes
in
the
daytime
and
sometimes
at
the
dead
of
night
notices
were
sent
to
obnoxious
persons
warning
them
to
stop
certain
practices
if
warning
failed
something
more
convincing
was
tried
fright
was
the
emotion
most
commonly
stirred
a
horseman
at
the
witching
hour
of
midnight
would
ride
up
to
the
house
of
some
offender
lift
his
head
gear
take
off
a
skull
and
hand
it
to
the
trembling
victim
with
the
request
that
he
hold
it
for
a
few
minutes
frequently
violence
was
employed
either
officially
or
unofficially
by
members
of
the
klan
tar
and
feathers
were
freely
applied
the
whip
was
sometimes
laid
on
unmercifully
and
occasionally
a
brutal
murder
was
committed
often
the
members
were
fired
upon
from
bushes
or
behind
trees
and
swift
retaliation
followed
so
alarming
did
the
clashes
become
that
in
congress
forbade
interference
with
electors
or
going
in
disguise
for
the
purpose
of
obstructing
the
exercise
of
the
rights
enjoyed
under
federal
law
in
anticipation
of
such
a
step
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
the
ku
klux
was
officially
dissolved
by
the
grand
wizard
in
nevertheless
the
local
societies
continued
their
organization
and
methods
the
spirit
survived
the
national
association
on
the
whole
says
a
southern
writer
it
is
not
easy
to
see
what
other
course
was
open
to
the
south
armed
resistance
was
out
of
the
question
and
yet
there
must
be
some
control
had
of
the
situation
if
force
was
denied
craft
was
inevitable
struggle
for
the
ballot
the
effects
of
intimidation
were
soon
seen
at
elections
the
freedman
into
whose
inexperienced
hand
the
ballot
had
been
thrust
was
ordinarily
loath
to
risk
his
head
by
the
exercise
of
his
new
rights
he
had
not
attained
them
by
a
long
and
laborious
contest
of
his
own
and
he
saw
no
urgent
reason
why
he
should
battle
for
the
privilege
of
using
them
the
mere
show
of
force
the
mere
existence
of
a
threat
deterred
thousands
of
from
appearing
at
the
polls
thus
the
whites
steadily
recovered
their
dominance
nothing
could
prevent
it
congress
enacted
force
bills
establishing
federal
supervision
of
elections
and
the
northern
politicians
protested
against
the
return
of
former
confederates
to
practical
if
not
official
power
but
all
such
opposition
was
like
resistance
to
the
course
of
nature
for
the
recovery
of
white
supremacy
in
this
way
was
quickly
felt
in
national
councils
the
democratic
party
in
the
north
welcomed
it
as
a
sign
of
its
return
to
power
the
more
moderate
republicans
anxious
to
heal
the
breach
in
american
unity
sought
to
encourage
rather
than
to
repress
it
so
it
came
about
that
amnesty
for
confederates
was
widely
advocated
yet
it
must
be
said
that
the
struggle
for
the
removal
of
disabilities
was
stubborn
and
bitter
lincoln
with
characteristic
generosity
in
the
midst
of
the
war
had
issued
a
general
proclamation
of
amnesty
to
nearly
all
who
had
been
in
arms
against
the
union
on
condition
that
they
take
an
oath
of
loyalty
but
johnson
vindictive
toward
southern
leaders
and
determined
to
make
treason
infamous
had
extended
the
list
of
exceptions
congress
even
more
relentless
in
its
pursuit
of
confederates
pushed
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
worked
the
sweeping
disabilities
we
have
just
described
to
appeals
for
comprehensive
clemency
congress
was
at
first
adamant
in
vain
did
men
like
carl
schurz
exhort
their
colleagues
to
crown
their
victory
in
battle
with
a
noble
act
of
universal
pardon
and
oblivion
congress
would
not
yield
it
would
grant
amnesty
in
individual
cases
for
the
principle
of
proscription
it
stood
fast
when
finally
in
seven
years
after
the
surrender
at
appomattox
it
did
pass
the
general
amnesty
bill
it
insisted
on
certain
exceptions
confederates
who
had
been
members
of
congress
just
before
the
war
or
had
served
in
other
high
posts
civil
or
military
under
the
federal
government
were
still
excluded
from
important
offices
not
until
the
summer
of
when
the
war
with
spain
produced
once
more
a
union
of
hearts
did
congress
relent
and
abolish
the
last
of
the
disabilities
imposed
on
the
confederates
force
bills
attacked
and
the
granting
of
amnesty
encouraged
the
democrats
to
redouble
their
efforts
all
along
the
line
in
they
captured
the
house
of
representatives
and
declared
war
on
the
force
bills
as
a
republican
senate
blocked
immediate
repeal
they
resorted
to
an
ingenious
parliamentary
trick
to
the
appropriation
bill
for
the
support
of
the
army
they
attached
a
rider
or
condition
to
the
effect
that
no
troops
should
be
used
to
sustain
the
republican
government
in
louisiana
the
senate
rejected
the
proposal
a
deadlock
ensued
and
congress
adjourned
without
making
provision
for
the
army
satisfied
with
the
technical
victory
the
democrats
let
the
army
bill
pass
the
next
session
but
kept
up
their
fight
on
the
force
laws
until
they
wrung
from
president
hayes
a
measure
forbidding
the
use
of
united
states
troops
in
supervising
elections
the
following
year
they
again
had
recourse
to
a
rider
on
the
army
bill
and
carried
it
through
putting
an
end
to
the
use
of
money
for
military
control
of
elections
the
reconstruction
program
was
clearly
going
to
pieces
and
the
supreme
court
helped
along
the
process
of
dissolution
by
declaring
parts
of
the
laws
invalid
in
the
democrats
even
won
a
majority
in
the
senate
and
returned
to
power
a
large
number
of
men
once
prominent
in
the
confederate
cause
the
passions
of
the
war
by
this
time
were
evidently
cooling
a
new
generation
of
men
was
coming
on
the
scene
the
supremacy
of
the
whites
in
the
south
if
not
yet
complete
was
at
least
assured
federal
marshals
their
deputies
and
supervisors
of
elections
still
possessed
authority
over
the
polls
but
their
strength
had
been
shorn
by
the
withdrawal
of
united
states
troops
the
war
on
the
remaining
remnants
of
the
force
bills
lapsed
into
desultory
skirmishing
when
in
the
last
fragment
was
swept
away
the
country
took
little
note
of
the
fact
the
only
task
that
lay
before
the
southern
leaders
was
to
write
in
the
constitutions
of
their
respective
states
the
provisions
of
law
which
would
clinch
the
gains
so
far
secured
and
establish
white
supremacy
beyond
the
reach
of
outside
intervention
supremacy
sealed
by
new
state
the
impetus
to
this
final
step
was
given
by
the
rise
of
the
populist
movement
in
the
south
which
sharply
divided
the
whites
and
in
many
communities
threw
the
balance
of
power
into
the
hands
of
the
few
colored
voters
who
survived
the
process
of
intimidation
southern
leaders
now
devised
new
constitutions
so
constructed
as
to
deprive
negroes
of
the
ballot
by
law
mississippi
took
the
lead
in
south
carolina
followed
five
years
later
louisiana
in
north
carolina
in
alabama
and
maryland
in
and
virginia
in
the
authors
of
these
measures
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
their
purposes
the
intelligent
white
men
of
the
south
said
governor
tillman
intend
to
govern
here
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
however
forbade
them
to
deprive
any
citizen
of
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
color
or
previous
condition
of
servitude
this
made
necessary
the
devices
of
indirection
they
were
few
simple
and
effective
the
first
and
most
easily
administered
was
the
ingenious
provision
requiring
each
prospective
voter
to
read
a
section
of
the
state
constitution
or
understand
and
explain
it
when
read
to
him
by
the
election
officers
as
an
alternative
the
payment
of
taxes
or
the
ownership
of
a
small
amount
of
property
was
accepted
as
a
qualification
for
voting
southern
leaders
unwilling
to
disfranchise
any
of
the
poor
white
men
who
had
stood
side
by
side
with
them
in
the
dark
days
of
reconstruction
also
resorted
to
a
famous
provision
known
as
the
grandfather
clause
this
plan
admitted
to
the
suffrage
any
man
who
did
not
have
either
property
or
educational
qualifications
provided
he
had
voted
on
or
before
or
was
the
son
or
grandson
of
any
such
person
the
devices
worked
effectively
of
the
negroes
in
mississippi
above
the
age
of
only
about

under

constitution
of
louisiana
had
colored

enrolled

under
the

drafted
two
years
later
the
registration
fell
to
an
analysis
of

carolina
in
indicates
that
only
about
one
negro
out
of
every
hundred
adult
males
of
that
race
took
part
in
elections
thus
was
closed
this
chapter
of
reconstruction
supreme
court
refuses
to
numerous
efforts
were
made
to
prevail
upon
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
to
declare
such
laws
unconstitutional
but
the
court
usually
on
technical
grounds
avoided
coming
to
a
direct
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
matter
in
one
case
the
court
remarked
that
it
could
not
take
charge
of
and
operate
the
election
machinery
of
alabama
it
concluded
that
relief
from
a
great
political
wrong
if
done
as
alleged
by
the
people
of
a
state
and
by
the
state
itself
must
be
given
by
them
or
by
the
legislative
and
executive
departments
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
only
one
of
the
several
schemes
employed
namely
the
grandfather
clause
was
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
this
blow
effected
in
by
the
decision
in
the
oklahoma
and
maryland
cases
left
however
the
main
structure
of
disfranchisement
unimpaired
to
reduce
southern
representation
in
these
provisions
excluding
thousands
of
male
citizens
from
the
ballot
did
not
in
express
terms
deprive
any
one
of
the
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color
they
did
not
therefore
run
counter
to
the
letter
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
but
they
did
unquestionably
make
the
states
which
adopted
them
liable
to
the
operations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
the
latter
very
explicitly
provides
that
whenever
any
state
deprives
adult
male
citizens
of
the
right
to
vote
except
in
certain
minor
cases
the
representation
of

the
proportion
which
such
number
of
disfranchised
citizens
bears
to
the
whole
number
of
male
citizens
over
years
of
age
mindful
of
this
provision
those
who
protested
against
disfranchisement
in
the
south
turned
to
the
republican
party
for
relief
asking
for
action
by
the
political
branches
of
the
federal
government
as
the
supreme
court
had
suggested
the
republicans
responded
in
their
platform
of
by
condemning
all
devices
designed
to
deprive
any
one
of
the
ballot
for
reasons
of
color
alone
they
demanded
the
enforcement
in
letter
and
spirit
of
the
fourteenth
as
well
as
all
other
amendments
though
victorious
in
the
election
the
republicans
refrained
from
reopening
the
ancient
contest
they
made
no
attempt
to
reduce
southern
representation
in
the
house
southern
leaders
while
protesting
against
the
declarations
of
their
opponents
were
able
to
view
them
as
idle
threats
in
no
way
endangering
the
security
of
the
measures
by
which
political
reconstruction
had
been
undone
solid
out
of
the
conflict
against
rule
there
emerged
what
was
long
known
as
the
solid
south
a
south
that
except
occasionally
in
the
border
states
never
gave
an
electoral
vote
to
a
republican
candidate
for
president
before
the
civil
war
the
southern
people
had
been
divided
on
political
questions
take
for
example
the
election
of
in
all
the
fifteen
slave
states
the
variety
of
opinion
was
marked
in
nine
of
them
delaware
virginia
tennessee
missouri
maryland
louisiana
kentucky
georgia
and
arkansas
the
combined
vote
against
the
representative
of
the
extreme
southern
point
of
view
breckinridge
constituted
a
safe
majority
in
each
of
the
six
states
which
were
carried
by
breckinridge
there
was
a
large
and
powerful
minority
in
north
carolina
breckinridge
majority
over
bell
and
douglas
was
only
votes
equally
astounding
to
those
who
imagine
the
south
united
in
defense
of
extreme
views
in
was
the
vote
for
bell
the
unionist
candidate
who
stood
firmly
for
the
constitution
and
silence
on
slavery
in
every
southern
state
bell
vote
was
large
in
virginia
kentucky
missouri
and
tennessee
it
was
greater
than
that
received
by
breckinridge
in
georgia
it
was
against
in
louisiana
against
in
mississippi
against
the
effect
of
the
civil
war
upon
these
divisions
was
immediate
and
decisive
save
in
the
border
states
where
thousands
of
men
continued
to
adhere
to
the
cause
of
union
in
the
confederacy
itself
nearly
all
dissent
was
silenced
by
war
men
who
had
been
bitter
opponents
joined
hands
in
defense
of
their
homes
when
the
armed
conflict
was
over
they
remained
side
by
side
working
against
republican
misrule
and
negro
domination
by
after
northern
supremacy
was
definitely
broken
they
boasted
that
there
were
at
least
twelve
southern
states
in
which
no
republican
candidate
for
president
could
win
a
single
electoral
vote
in
the
solid
though
every
one
grew
accustomed
to
speak
of
the
south
as
solid
it
did
not
escape
close
observers
that
in
a
number
of
southern
states
there
appeared
from
time
to
time
a
fairly
large
body
of
dissenters
in
the
populists
made
heavy
inroads
upon
the
democratic
ranks
on
other
occasions
the
contests
between
factions
within
the
democratic
party
over
the
nomination
of
candidates
revealed
sharp
differences
of
opinion
in
some
places
moreover
there
grew
up
a
republican
minority
of
respectable
size
for
example
in
georgia
taft
in
polled
votes
against
for
bryan
in
north
carolina
against
in
tennessee
against
in
kentucky
against
in
senator
harding
the
republican
candidate
broke
the
record
by
carrying
tennessee
as
well
as
kentucky
oklahoma
and
maryland
the
economic
advance
of
the
south
of
the
great
in
the
dissolution
of
chattel
slavery
it
was
inevitable
that
the
great
estate
should
give
way
before
the
small
farm
the
plantation
was
in
fact
founded
on
slavery
it
was
continued
and
expanded
by
slavery
before
the
war
the
prosperous
planter
either
by
inclination
or
necessity
invested
his
surplus
in
more
land
to
add
to
his
original
domain
as
his
slaves
increased
in
number
he
was
forced
to
increase
his
acreage
or
sell
them
and
he
usually
preferred
the
former
especially
in
the
far
south
still
another
element
favored
the
large
estate
slave
labor
quickly
exhausted
the
soil
and
of
its
own
force
compelled
the
cutting
of
the
forests
and
the
extension
of
the
area
under
cultivation
finally
the
planter
took
a
natural
pride
in
his
great
estate
it
was
a
sign
of
his
prowess
and
his
social
prestige
in
the
foundations
of
the
planting
system
were
gone
it
was
difficult
to
get
efficient
labor
to
till
the
vast
plantations
the
planters
themselves
were
burdened
with
debts
and
handicapped
by
lack
of
capital
negroes
commonly
preferred
tilling
plots
of
their
own
rented
or
bought
under
mortgage
to
the
more
irksome
wage
labor
under
white
supervision
the
land
hunger
of
the
white
farmer
once
checked
by
the
planting
system
reasserted
itself
before
these
forces
the
plantation
broke
up
the

became
the
unit
of
cultivation

the

in
the

of
the

of
the
potomac

in
arkansas
and
louisiana
from
year
to

the
process
of
breaking
up
continued
with
all
that
it
implied
in
the
creation
of
farmers
diversification
of
no
less
significant
was
the
concurrent
diversification
of
crops
under
slavery
tobacco
rice
and
sugar
were
staples
and
cotton
was
king
these
were
standard
crops
the
methods
of
cultivation
were
simple
and
easily
learned
they
tested
neither
the
skill
nor
the
ingenuity
of
the
slaves
as
the
returns
were
quick
they
did
not
call
for
investments
of
capital
after
slavery
was
abolished
they
still
remained
the
staples
but
agriculturists
saw
the
dangers
of
depending
upon
a
few
crops
the
mild
climate
all
the
way
around
the
coast
from
virginia
to
texas
and
the
character
of
the

the
development
of

was
in
every
respect
remarkable
particularly
in
louisiana
arkansas
and
mississippi
at
the
end
of
the
first
decade
of
the
twentieth
century
primacy
in
lumber
had
passed
from
the
great
lakes
region
to
the
south
in
eight
southern
states
produced
nearly
four
times
as
much
lumber
as
the
lake
states
and
twice
as
much
as
the
vast
forests
of
washington
and
oregon
the
development
of
the
cotton
industry
in
the
meantime
was
similarly
astounding
in
cotton
spinning
was
a
negligible
matter
in
the
southern
states
in
they
had
of
the
mills
of
the
country
at
the
end
of
the
century
they
had
the
mills
the
two

taking
the
lead
by
consuming
more
than
of
their
entire
cotton
crop
having
both
the
raw
materials
and
the
power
at
hand
they
enjoyed
many
advantages
over
the

at
the
opening
of

were
outstripping
the
latter
in
the
proportion

put

moreover
the
cotton
planters
finding
a
market
at
the
neighboring

began
to
look
forward
to
a
day
when
they
would
be
somewhat
emancipated

during
the
next
twenty
years
over
thirty
thousand
miles
were
added
most
of
the
increase
being
in
texas
about
there
opened
a
period
of
consolidation
in
which
scores
of
short
lines
were
united
mainly
under
the
leadership
of
northern
capitalists
and
new
through
service
opened
to
the
north
and
west
thus
southern
industries
were
given
easy
outlets
to
the
markets
of
the
nation
and
brought
within
the
main
currents
of
national
business
enterprise
social
effects
of
the
economic
as
long
as
the
slave
system
lasted
and
planting
was
the
major
interest
the
south
was
bound
to
be
sectional
in
character
with
slavery
gone
crops
diversified
natural
resources
developed
and
industries
promoted
the
social
order
of
the
days
inevitably
dissolved
the
south
became
more
and
more
assimilated
to
the
system
of
the
north
in
this
process
several
lines
of
development
are
evident
in
the
first
place
we
see
the
steady
rise
of
the
small
farmer
even
in
the
old
days
there
had
been
a
large
class
of
white
yeomen
who
owned
no
slaves
and
tilled
the
soil
with
their
own
hands
but
they
labored
under
severe
handicaps
they
found
the
fertile
lands
of
the
coast
and
river
valleys
nearly
all
monopolized
by
planters
and
they
were
by
the
force
of
circumstances
driven
into
the
uplands
where
the
soil
was
thin
and
the
crops
were
light
still
they
increased
in
numbers
and
zealously
worked
their
freeholds
the
war
proved
to
be
their
opportunity
with
the
of
the
plantations
they
managed
to
buy
land
more
worthy
of
their
plows
by
intelligent
labor
and
intensive
cultivation
they
were
able
to
restore
much
of
the
soil
to
its
original
fertility
in
the
meantime
they
rose
with
their
prosperity
in
the
social
and
political
scale
it
became
common
for
the
sons
of
white
farmers
to
enter
the
professions
while
their
daughters
went
away
to
college
and
prepared
for
teaching
thus
a
more
democratic
tone
was
given
to
the
white
society
of
the
south
moreover
the
migration
to
the
north
and
west
which
had
formerly
carried
thousands
of
energetic
sons
and
daughters
to
search
for
new
homesteads
was
materially
reduced
the
energy
of
the
agricultural
population
went
into
rehabilitation
the
increase
in
the
number
of
independent
farmers
was
accompanied
by
the
rise
of
small
towns
and
villages
which
gave
diversity
to
the
life
of
the
south
before
it
was
possible
to
travel
through
endless
stretches
of
cotton
and
tobacco
the
social
affairs
of
the
planter
family
centered
in
the
homestead
even
if
they
were
occasionally
interrupted
by
trips
to
distant
cities
or
abroad
carpentry
bricklaying
and
blacksmithing
were
usually
done
by
slaves
skilled
in
simple
handicrafts
supplies
were
bought
wholesale
in
this
way
there
was
little
place
in
plantation
economy
for
villages
and
towns
with
their
stores
and
mechanics
the
abolition
of
slavery
altered
this
small
farms
spread
out
where
plantations
had
once
stood
the
skilled
freedmen
turned
to
agriculture
rather
than
to
handicrafts
white
men
of
a
business
or
mechanical
bent
found
an
opportunity
to
serve
the
needs
of
their
communities
so
local
merchants
and
mechanics
became
an
important
element
in
the
social
system
in
the
county
seats
once
dominated
by
the
planters
business
and
professional
men
assumed
the
leadership
another
vital
outcome
of
this
revolution
was
the
transference
of
a
large
part
of
planting
enterprise
to
business
bruce
a
southern
historian
of
fine
scholarship
has
summed
up
this
process
in
a
single
telling
paragraph
the
higher
planting
class
that
under
the
old
system
gave
so
much
distinction
to
rural
life
has
so
far
as
it
has
survived
at
all
been
concentrated
in
the
cities
the
families
that
in
the
time
of
slavery
would
have
been
found
only
in
the
country
are
now
found
with
a
few
exceptions
in
the
towns
the
transplantation
has
been
practically
universal
the
talent
the
energy
the
ambition
that
formerly
sought
expression
in
the
management
of
great
estates
and
the
control
of
hosts
of
slaves
now
seek
a
field
of
action
in
trade
in
manufacturing
enterprises
or
in
the
general
enterprises
of
development
this
was
for
the
ruling
class
of
the
south
the
natural
outcome
of
the
great
economic
revolution
that
followed
the
war
as
in
all
other
parts
of
the
world
the
mechanical
revolution
was
attended
by
the
growth
of
a
population
of
industrial
workers
dependent
not
upon
the
soil
but
upon
wages
for
their
livelihood
when
jefferson
davis
was
inaugurated
president
of
the
southern
confederacy
there
were
approximately
only
one
hundred
thousand
persons
employed
in
southern
manufactures
as
against
more
than
a
million
in
northern
mills
fifty
years
later
georgia
and
alabama
alone
had
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
necessarily
this
meant
also
a
material
increase
in
urban
population
although
the
wide
dispersion
of
cotton
spinning
among
small
centers
prevented
the
congestion
that
had
accompanied
the
rise
of
the
textile
industry
in
new
england
in
new
orleans
atlanta
memphis
nashville
and
houston
stood
in
the
same
relation
to
the
new
south
that
cincinnati
chicago
cleveland
and
detroit
had
stood
to
the
new
west
fifty
years
before
the
problems
of
labor
and
capital
and
municipal
administration
which
the
earlier
writers
boasted
would
never
perplex
the
planting
south
had
come
in
full
force

a
glimpse
of
memphis
tennessee
revolution
in
the
status
of
the
no
part
of
southern
society
was
so
profoundly
affected
by
the
civil
war
and
economic
reconstruction
as
the
former
slaves
on
the
day
of
emancipation
they
stood
free
but
the
owners
of
no
tools
or
property
the
masters
of
no
trade
and
wholly
inexperienced
in
the
arts
of
that
characterized
the
whites
in
general
they
had
never
been
accustomed
to
looking
out
for
themselves
the
plantation
bell
had
called
them
to
labor
and
released
them
doles
of
food
and
clothing
had
been
regularly
made
in
given
quantities
they
did
not
understand
wages
ownership
renting
contracts
mortgages
leases
bills
or
accounts
when
they
were
emancipated
four
courses
were
open
to
them
they
could
flee
from
the
plantation
to
the
nearest
town
or
city
or
to
the
distant
north
to
seek
a
livelihood
thousands
of
them
chose
this
way
overcrowding
cities
where
disease
mowed
them
down
they
could
remain
where
they
were
in
their
cabins
and
work
for
daily
wages
instead
of
food
clothing
and
shelter
this
second
course
the
major
portion
of
them
chose
but
as
few
masters
had
cash
to
dispense
the
new
relation
was
much
like
the
old
in
fact
it
was
still
one
of
barter
the
planter
offered
food
clothing
and
shelter
the
former
slaves
gave
their
labor
in
return
that
was
the
best
that
many
of
them
could
do
a
third
course
open
to
freedmen
was
that
of
renting
from
the
former
master
paying
him
usually
with
a
share
of
the
produce
of
the
land
this
way
a
large
number
of
them
chose
it
offered
them
a
chance
to
become

being
to
a

extent
at
least
master
of

of

the
final
and
most
difficult
path
was
that
to
ownership
of

many
a

helped
his
former

to
acquire
small

by
offering

the
more
enterprising
and
the
more
fortunate
who
started
life
as

or
made
their

upward

so
many
cases
that
by

century
of

colored

owned

they
tilled
in

the
south
though
relatively
poor
made
relatively
large
expenditures
for
the
education
of
the
colored
population
by
the
opening
of
the
twentieth
century
facilities
were
provided
for
more
than
of
the
colored
children
of
school
age
while
in
many
respects
this
progress
was
disappointing
its
significance
to
be
appreciated
must
be
derived
from
a
comparison
with
the
total
illiteracy
which
prevailed
under
slavery
in
spite
of
all
that
happened
however
the
status
of
the
negroes
in
the
south
continued
to
give
a
peculiar
character
to
that
section
of
the
country
they
were
almost
entirely
excluded
from
the
exercise
of
the
suffrage
especially
in
the
far
south
special
rooms
were
set
aside
for
them
at
the
railway
stations
and
special
cars
on
the
railway
lines
in
the
field
of
industry
calling
for
technical
skill
it
appears
from
the
census
figures
that
they
lost
ground
between
and
a
condition
which
their
friends
ascribed
to
discriminations
against
them
in
law
and
in
labor
organizations
and
their
critics
ascribed
to
their
lack
of
aptitude
whatever
may
be
the
truth
the
fact
remained
that
at
the
opening
of
the
twentieth
century
neither
the
hopes
of
the
emancipators
nor
the
fears
of
their
opponents
were
realized
the
marks
of
the
peculiar
institution
were
still
largely
impressed
upon
southern

the
situation
however
was
by
no

on
the

was

which
characterized

declined
at
the

a
part
of
the
foreign
immigration
into
the

was
diverted
southward
as
the

these

how

became

or
how
like

all

how

very
closely
related
to
the

enterprise
on

the

in

employed

it
was
common
for
a
manufacturer
to
rise
from
small

by
financing
extensions
out
of

this
state

significance
of
the
the
corporation
in
fact
became
the
striking
feature
of
american
business
life
one
of
the
most
marvelous
institutions
of
all
time
comparable
in
wealth
and
power
and
the
number
of
its
servants
with
kingdoms
and
states
of
old
the
effect
of
its
rise
and
growth
can
not
be
summarily
estimated
but
some
special
facts
are
obvious
it
made
possible
gigantic
enterprises
once
entirely
beyond
the
reach
of
any
individual
no
matter
how
rich
it
eliminated
many
of
the
futile
and
costly
wastes
of
competition
in
connection
with
manufacture
advertising
and
selling
it
studied
the
cheapest
methods
of
production
and
shut
down
mills
that
were
poorly
equipped
or
disadvantageously
located
it
established
laboratories
for
research
in
industry
chemistry
and
mechanical
inventions
through
the
sale
of
stocks
and
bonds
it
enabled
tens
of
thousands
of
people
to
become
capitalists
if
only
in
a
small
way
the
corporation
made
it
possible
for
one
person
to
own
for
instance
a
share
in
a
million
dollar
business
concern
a
thing
entirely
impossible
under
a
régime
of
individual
owners
and
partnerships
there
was
of
course
another
side
to
the
picture
many
of
the
corporations
sought
to
become
monopolies
and
to
make
profits
not
by
economies
and
good
management
but
by
extortion
from
purchasers
sometimes
they
mercilessly
crushed
small
business
men
their
competitors
bribed
members
of
legislatures
to
secure
favorable
laws
and
contributed
to
the
campaign
funds
of
both
leading
parties
wherever
a
trust
approached
the
position
of
a
monopoly
it
acquired
a
dominion
over
the
labor
market
which
enabled
it
to
break
even
the
strongest
trade
unions
in
short
the
power
of
the
trust
in
finance
in
manufacturing
in
politics
and
in
the
field
of
labor
control
can
hardly
be
measured
corporation
and
in
the
development
of
the
corporation
there
was
to
be
observed
a
distinct
severing
of
the
old
ties
between
master
and
workmen
which
existed
in
the
days
of
small
industries
for
the
personal
bond
between
the
owner
and
the
employees
was
substituted
a
new
relation
in
most
parts
of
our
country
as
president
wilson
once
said
men
work
not
for
themselves
not
as
partners
in
the
old
way
in
which
they
used
to
work
but
generally
as
employees
in
a
higher
or
lower
grade
of
great
corporations
the
owner
disappeared
from
the
factory
and
in
his
place
came
the
manager
representing
the
usually
invisible
stockholders
and
dependent
for
his
success
upon
his
ability
to
make
profits
for
the
owners
hence
the
term
soulless
corporation
which
was
to
exert
such
a
deep
influence
on
american
thinking
about
industrial
relations
and
expressed
in
terms
of
human
life
this
era
of
unprecedented
enterprise
meant
huge
industrial
cities
and
an
immense
labor
supply
derived
mainly
from
european
immigration
here
too
figures
tell
only
a
part
of
the
story
in
washington
day
of
the
american
people
were
engaged
in
agriculture
and
lived
in
the
country
in
more
than
of
the
population
dwelt
in
towns
of

over
in
more
than
half
of
the
population
lived
in
towns
of
over
in
forty
years
between

greater
new
york
had
grown
from
to
san
francisco
from
to
chicago
from
to
the
miles
of
city
tenements
began
to
rival
in
the
number
of
their
residents
the
farm
homesteads
of
the
west
the
time
so
dreaded
by
jefferson
had
arrived
people
were
piled
upon
one
another
in
great
cities
and
the
republic
of
small
farmers
had
passed
away
to
these
industrial
centers
flowed
annually
an
tide
of
immigration
reaching
the
half
million
point
in
rising
to
of
a
million
three
years
later
and
passing
the
million
mark
in
a
single
year
at
the
opening
of
the
new
century
immigration
was
as
old
as
america
but
new
elements
now
entered
the
situation
in
the
first
place
there
were
radical
changes
in
the
nationality
of
the
newcomers
the
migration
from
northern
europe
england
ireland
germany
and
scandinavia
diminished
that
from
italy
russia
and
increased
more
than
of
the
entire
number
coming
from
these
three
lands
between
the
years
and
these
later
immigrants
were
italians
poles
magyars
czechs
slovaks
russians
and
jews
who
came
from
countries
far
removed
from
the
language
and
the
traditions
of
england
whence
came
the
founders
of
america
in
the
second
place
the
reception
accorded
the
newcomers
differed
from
that
given
to
the
immigrants
in
the
early
days
by
all
the
free
land
was
gone
they
could
not
therefore
be
dispersed
widely
among
the
native
americans
to
assimilate
quickly
and
unconsciously
the
habits
and
ideas
of
american
life
on
the
contrary
they
were
diverted
mainly
to
the
industrial
centers
there
they
crowded
nay
overcrowded
into
colonies
of
their
own
where
they
preserved
their
languages
their
newspapers
and
their
customs
and
views
so
eager
were
american
business
men
to
get
an
enormous
labor
supply
that
they
asked
few
questions
about
the
effect
of
this
alien
invasion
upon
the
old
america
inherited
from
the
fathers
they
even
stimulated
the
invasion
artificially
by
importing
huge
armies
of
foreigners
under
contract
to
work
in
specified
mines
and
mills
there
seemed
to
be
no
limit
to
the
factories
forges
refineries
and
railways
that
could
be
built
to
the
multitudes
that
could
be
employed
in
conquering
a
continent
as
for
the
future
that
was
in
the
hands
of
providence
theories
of
as
the
statesmen
of
hamilton
school
and
the
planters
of
calhoun
had
their
theories
of
government
and
politics
so
the
leaders
in
business
enterprise
had
theirs
it
was
simple
and
easily
stated
it
is
the
duty
of
the
government
they
urged
to
protect
american
industry
against
foreign
competition
by
means
of
high
tariffs
on
imported
goods
to
aid
railways
by
generous
grants
of
land
to
sell
mineral
and
timber
lands
at
low
prices
to
energetic
men
ready
to
develop
them
and
then
to
leave
the
rest
to
the
initiative
and
drive
of
individuals
and
companies
all
government
interference
with
the
management
prices
rates
charges
and
conduct
of
private
business
they
held
to
be
either
wholly
pernicious
or
intolerably
impertinent
judging
from
their
speeches
and
writings
they
conceived
the
nation
as
a
great
collection
of
individuals
companies
and
labor
unions
all
struggling
for
profits
or
high
wages
and
held
together
by
a
government
whose
principal
duty
was
to
keep
the
peace
among
them
and
protect
industry
against
the
foreign
manufacturer
such
was
the
political
theory
of
business
during
the
generation
that
followed
the
civil
war
the
supremacy
of
the
republican
party
men
and
republican
most
of
the
leaders
in
industry
gravitated
to
the
republican
ranks
they
worked
in
the
north
and
the
republican
party
was
essentially
northern
it
was
moreover
at
least
so
far
as
the
majority
of
its
members
were
concerned
committed
to
protective
tariffs
a
sound
monetary
and
banking
system
the
promotion
of
railways
and
industry
by
land
grants
and
the
development
of
internal
improvements
it
was
furthermore
generous
in
its
immigration
policy
it
proclaimed
america
to
be
an
asylum
for
the
oppressed
of
all
countries
and
flung
wide
the
doors
for
immigrants
eager
to
fill
the
factories
man
the
mines
and
settle
upon
western
lands
in
a
word
the
republicans
stood
for
all
those
specific
measures
which
favored
the
enlargement
and
prosperity
of
business
at
the
same
time
they
resisted
government
interference
with
private
enterprise
they
did
not
regulate
railway
rates
prosecute
trusts
for
forming
combinations
or
prevent
railway
companies
from
giving
lower
rates
to
some
shippers
than
to
others
to
sum
it
up
the
political
theories
of
the
republican
party
for
three
decades
after
the
civil
war
were
the
theories
of
american
business
prosperous
and
profitable
industries
for
the
owners
and
the
full
dinner
pail
for
the
workmen
naturally
a
large
portion
of
those
who
flourished
under
its
policies
gave
their
support
to
it
voted
for
its
candidates
and
subscribed
to
its
campaign
funds
of
republican
strength
in
the
the
republican
party
was
in
fact
a
political
organization
of
singular
power
it
originated
in
a
wave
of
moral
enthusiasm
having
attracted
to
itself
if
not
the
abolitionists
certainly
all
those
idealists
like
james
russell
lowell
and
george
william
curtis
who
had
opposed
slavery
when
opposition
was
neither
safe
nor
popular
to
moral
principles
it
added
practical
considerations
business
men
had
confidence
in
it
workingmen
who
longed
for
the
independence
of
the
farmer
owed
to
its
indulgent
land
policy
the
opportunity
of
securing
free
homesteads
in
the
west
the
immigrant
landing
penniless
on
these
shores
as
a
result
of
the
same
beneficent
system
often
found
himself
in
a
little
while
with
an
estate
as
large
as
many
a
baronial
domain
in
the
old
world
under
a
republican
administration
the
union
had
been
saved
to
it
the
veterans
of
the
war
could
turn
with
confidence
for
those
rewards
of
service
which
the
government
could
bestow
pensions
surpassing
in
liberality
anything
that
the
world
had
ever
seen
under
a
republican
administration
also
the
great
debt
had
been
created
in
the
defense
of
the
union
and
to
the
republican
party
every
investor
in
government
bonds
could
look
for
the
full
and
honorable
discharge
of
the
interest
and
principal
the
spoils
system
inaugurated
by
jacksonian
democracy
in
turn
placed
all
the
federal
offices
in
republican
hands
furnishing
an
army
of
party
workers
to
be
counted
on
for
loyal
service
in
every
campaign
of
all
these
things
republican
leaders
made
full
and
vigorous
use
sometimes
ascribing
to
the
party
in
accordance
with
ancient
political
usage
merits
and
achievements
not
wholly
its
own
particularly
was
this
true
in
the
case
of
saving
the
union
when
in
the
economy
of
providence
this
land
was
to
be
purged
of
human
slavery
the
republican
party
came
into
power
ran
a
declaration
in
one
platform
the
republican
party
suppressed
a
gigantic
rebellion
emancipated
four
million
slaves
decreed
the
equal
citizenship
of
all
and
established
universal
suffrage
ran
another
as
for
the
aid
rendered
by
the
millions
of
northern
democrats
who
stood
by
the
union
and
the
tens
of
thousands
of
them
who
actually
fought
in
the
union
army
the
republicans
in
their
zeal
were
inclined
to
be
oblivious
they
repeatedly
charged
the
democratic
party
with
being
the
same
in
character
and
spirit
as
when
it
sympathized
with
treason
control
of
the
to
the
strength
enjoyed
in
the
north
the
republicans
for
a
long
time
added
the
advantages
that
came
from
control
over
the
former
confederate
states
where
the
newly
enfranchised
negroes
under
white
leadership
gave
a
grateful
support
to
the
party
responsible
for
their
freedom
in
this
branch
of
politics
motives
were
so
mixed
that
no
historian
can
hope
to
appraise
them
all
at
their
proper
values
on
the
one
side
of
the
ledger
must
be
set
the
vigorous
efforts
of
the
honest
and
sincere
friends
of
the
freedmen
to
win
for
them
complete
civil
and
political
equality
wiping
out
not
only
slavery
but
all
its
badges
of
misery
and
servitude
on
the
same
side
must
be
placed
the
labor
of
those
who
had
valiantly
fought
in
forum
and
field
to
save
the
union
and
who
regarded
continued
republican
supremacy
after
the
war
as
absolutely
necessary
to
prevent
the
former
leaders
in
secession
from
coming
back
to
power
at
the
same
time
there
were
undoubtedly
some
men
of
the
baser
sort
who
looked
on
politics
as
a
game
and
who
made
use
of
in
the
south
to
win
the
spoils
that
might
result
from
it
at
all
events
both
by
laws
and
presidential
acts
the
republicans
for
many
years
kept
a
keen
eye
upon
the
maintenance
of
their
dominion
in
the
south
their
declaration
that
neither
the
law
nor
its
administration
should
admit
any
discrimination
in
respect
of
citizens
by
reason
of
race
color
or
previous
condition
of
servitude
appealed
to
idealists
and
brought
results
in
elections
even
south
carolina
where
reposed
the
ashes
of
john
calhoun
went
republican
in
by
a
vote
of
three
to
one
republican
control
was
made
easy
by
the
force
bills
described
in
a
previous
chapter
measures
which
vested
the
supervision
of
elections
in
federal
officers
appointed
by
republican
presidents
these
drastic
measures
departing
from
american
tradition
the
republican
authors
urged
were
necessary
to
safeguard
the
purity
of
the
ballot
not
merely
in
the
south
where
the
timid
freedman
might
readily
be
frightened
from
using
it
but
also
in
the
north
particularly
in
new
york
city
where
it
was
claimed
that
fraud
was
regularly
practiced
by
democratic
leaders
the
democrats
on
their
side
indignantly
denied
the
charges
replying
that
the
force
bills
were
nothing
but
devices
created
by
the
republicans
for
the
purpose
of
securing
their
continued
rule
through
systematic
interference
with
elections
even
the
measures
of
reconstruction
were
deemed
by
democratic
leaders
as
thinly
veiled
schemes
to
establish
republican
power
throughout
the
country
nor
is
there
the
slightest
doubt
exclaimed
samuel
tilden
spokesman
of
the
democrats
in
new
york
and
candidate
for
president
in
that
the
paramount
object
and
motive
of
the
republican
party
is
by
these
means
to
secure
itself
against
a
reaction
of
opinion
adverse
to
it
in
our
great
populous
northern
commonwealths
when
the
republican
party
resolved
to
establish
negro
supremacy
in
the
ten
states
in
order
to
gain
to
itself
the
representation
of
those
states
in
congress
it
had
to
begin
by
governing
the
people
of
those
states
by
the
sword
the
next
was
the
creation
of
new
electoral
bodies
for
those
ten
states
in
which
by
exclusions
by
disfranchisements
and
proscriptions
by
control
over
registration
by
applying
test
oaths
by
intimidation
and
by
every
form
of
influence
three
million
negroes
are
made
to
predominate
over
four
and
a
half
million
whites
war
as
a
campaign
even
the
repeal
of
force
bills
could
not
allay
the
sectional
feelings
engendered
by
the
war
the
republicans
could
not
forgive
the
men
who
had
so
recently
been
in
arms
against
the
union
and
insisted
on
calling
them
traitors
and
rebels
the
southerners
smarting
under
the
reconstruction
acts
could
regard
the
republicans
only
as
political
oppressors
the
passions
of
the
war
had
been
too
strong
the
distress
too
deep
to
be
soon
forgotten
the
generation
that
went
through
it
all
remembered
it
all
for
twenty
years
the
republicans
in
their
speeches
and
platforms
made
a
straight
appeal
to
the
patriotism
of
the
northern
voters
they
maintained
that
their
party
which
had
saved
the
union
and
emancipated
the
slaves
was
alone
worthy
of
protecting
the
union
and
uplifting
the
freedmen
though
the
democrats
especially
in
the
north
resented
this
policy
and
dubbed
it
with
the
expressive
but
inelegant
phrase
waving
the
bloody
shirt
the
republicans
refused
to
surrender
a
slogan
which
made
such
a
ready
popular
appeal
as
late
as
a
leader
expressed
the
hope
that
they
might
wring
one
more
president
from
the
bloody
shirt
they
refused
to
let
the
country
forget
that
the
democratic
candidate
grover
cleveland
had
escaped
military
service
by
hiring
a
substitute
and
they
made
political
capital
out
of
the
fact
that
he
had
insulted
the
veterans
of
the
grand
army
of
the
republic
by
going
fishing
on
decoration
day
republican
fortified
by
all
these
elements
of
strength
the
republicans
held
the
presidency
from
to
the
three
presidents
elected
in
this
period
grant
hayes
and
garfield
had
certain
striking
characteristics
in
common
they
were
all
of
origin
humble
enough
to
please
the
most
exacting
jacksonian
democrat
they
had
been
generals
in
the
union
army
grant
next
to
lincoln
was
regarded
as
the
savior
of
the
constitution
hayes
and
garfield
though
lesser
lights
in
the
military
firmament
had
honorable
records
duly
appreciated
by
veterans
of
the
war
now
thoroughly
organized
into
the
grand
army
of
the
republic
it
is
true
that
grant
was
not
a
politician
and
had
never
voted
the
republican
ticket
but
this
was
readily
overlooked
hayes
and
garfield
on
the
other
hand
were
loyal
party
men
the
former
had
served
in
congress
and
for
three
terms
as
governor
of
his
state
the
latter
had
long
been
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
was
when
he
received
the
nomination
for
president
all
of
them
possessed
moreover
another
important
asset
which
was
not
forgotten
by
the
astute
managers
who
led
in
selecting
candidates
all
of
them
were
from
ohio
though
grant
had
been
in
illinois
when
the
summons
to
military
duties
came
and
ohio
was
a
strategic
state
it
lay

having

yet
being
mainly
agricultural
still
it

not

sympathy
for
the

who
showed

tendencies
whatever
share
the
east
had
in

it
was

that
the

was
to

this
division
in

not
uncommon
in
political
management
was
always
accompanied
by
a
judicious
selection
of
the
candidate
for
vice
president
with
garfield
for
example
was
associated
a
prominent
new
york
politician
chester
arthur
who
as
fate
decreed
was
destined
to
more
than
three
years
service
as
chief
magistrate
on
the
assassination
of
his
superior
in
office
disputed
election
of
while
taking
note
of
the
long
years
of
republican
supremacy
it
must
be
recorded
that
grave
doubts
exist
in
the
minds
of
many
historians
as
to
whether
one
of
the
three
presidents
hayes
was
actually
the
victor
in
or
not
his
democratic
opponent
samuel
tilden
received
a
popular
plurality
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
and
had
a
plausible
claim
to
a
majority
of
the
electoral
vote
at
all
events
four
states
sent
in
double
returns
one
set
for
tilden
and
another
for
hayes
and
a
deadlock
ensued
both
parties
vehemently
claimed
the
election
and
the
passions
ran
so
high
that
sober
men
did
not
shrink
from
speaking
of
civil
war
again
fortunately
in
the
end
the
counsels
of
peace
prevailed
congress
provided
for
an
electoral
commission
of
fifteen
men
to
review
the
contested
returns
the
democrats
inspired
by
tilden
moderation
accepted
the
judgment
in
favor
of
hayes
even
though
they
were
not
convinced
that
he
was
really
entitled
to
the
office
the
growth
of
opposition
to
republican
rule
in
american
political
during
their
long
tenure
of
office
the
republicans
could
not
escape
the
inevitable
consequences
of
power
that
is
evil
practices
and
corrupt
conduct
on
the
part
of
some
who
found
shelter
within
the
party
for
that
matter
neither
did
the
democrats
manage
to
avoid
such
difficulties
in
those
states
and
cities
where
they
had
the
majority
in
new
york
city
for
instance
the
local
democratic
organization
known
as
tammany
hall
passed
under
the
sway
of
a
group
of
politicians
headed
by
boss
tweed
he
plundered
the
city
treasury
until
citizens
supported
by
samuel
tilden
the
democratic
leader
of
the
state
rose
in
revolt
drove
the
ringleader
from
power
and
sent
him
to
jail
in
philadelphia
the
local
republican
bosses
were
guilty
of
offenses
as
odious
as
those
committed
by
new
york
politicians
indeed
the
decade
that
followed
the
civil
war
was
marred
by
so
many
scandals
in
public
life
that
one
acute
editor
was
moved
to
inquire
are
not
all
the
great
communities
of
the
western
world
growing
more
corrupt
as
they
grow
in
wealth
in
the
sphere
of
national
politics
where
the
opportunities
were
greater
betrayals
of
public
trust
were
even
more
flagrant

another

the

straight
to
the
door
of
one
of
them
in
the
lower
ranges
of

the
spoils
system
became
more
virulent
as
the
number
of
federal
employees
increased
the
holders
of
offices
and
the
seekers
after
them
constituted
a
veritable
political
army
they
crowded
into
republican
councils
for
the
republicans

in
power
could
alone
dispense
federal
favors
they
filled
positions
in
the
party
ranging
from
the
lowest
township
committee
to
the
national
convention
they
helped
to
nominate
candidates
and

elbowed
to

side
the
busy
citizen
not
conversant
with

intrigues
who
could
only
give
an
occasional
day
to
political
matters
even
the
civil
service
act
of
wrung
from
a
reluctant
congress
two
years
after
the
assassination
of
garfield
made
little
change
for
a
long
time
it
took
away
from
the
spoilsmen
a
few
thousand
government
positions
but
it
formed
no
check
on
the
practice
of
rewarding
party
workers
from
the
public
treasury
on
viewing
this
state
of
affairs
many
a

profoundly
discouraged
james

thought
he
saw
a
steady
decline
in

morals
in

of

he
had
exclaimed
there
is
something
magnificent
in
having
a
country
to
love
ten
years
later
when
asked
to
write
an
ode
for
the
centennial
at
philadelphia
in

could
think
only
of
a
biting
satire
on

your

show
your

one
poor
hundred
years
when

critics
condemned
him
for
this
attack
upon
his
native

lowell
replied
in
sadness
these
fellows
have
no

of
what
love

it
was
in
my
very
blood
and

if

reform
movement
in
republican
the
sentiments
expressed
by
lowell
himself
a
republican
and
for
a
time
american
ambassador
to
england
were
shared
by
many
men
in
his
party
very
soon
after
the
close
of
the
civil
war
some
of
them
began
to
protest
vigorously
against
the
policies
and
conduct
of
their
leaders
in
the
dissenters
calling
themselves
liberal
republicans
broke
away
altogether
nominated
a
candidate
of
their
own
horace
greeley
and
put
forward
a
platform
indicting
the
republican
president
fiercely
enough
to
please
the
most
uncompromising
democrat
they
accused
grant
of
using
the
powers
and
opportunities
of
his
high
office
for
the
promotion
of
personal
ends
they
charged
him
with
retaining
notoriously
corrupt
and
unworthy
men
in
places
of
power
and
responsibility
they
alleged
that
the
republican
party
kept
alive
the
passions
and
resentments
of
the
late
civil
war
to
use
them
for
their
own
advantages
and
employed
the
public
service
of
the
government
as
a
machinery
of
corruption
and
personal
influence
it
was
not
apparent
however
from
the
ensuing
election
that
any
considerable
number
of
republicans
accepted
the
views
of
the
liberals
greeley
though
indorsed
by
the
democrats
was
utterly
routed
and
died
of
a
broken
heart
the
lesson
of
his
discomfiture
seemed
to
be
that
independent
action
was
futile
so
at
least
it
was
regarded
by
most
men
of
the
rising
generation
like
henry
cabot
lodge
of
massachusetts
and
theodore
roosevelt
of
new
york
profiting
by
the
experience
of
greeley
they
insisted
in
season
and
out
that
reformers
who
desired
to
rid
the
party
of
abuses
should
remain
loyal
to
it
and
do
their
work
on
the
inside
mugwumps
and
cleveland
democracy
in
though
aided
by
republican
dissensions
the
democrats
were
slow
in
making
headway
against
the
political
current
they
were
deprived
of
the
energetic
and
capable
leadership
once
afforded
by
the
planters
like
calhoun
davis
and
toombs
they
were
saddled
by
their
opponents
with
responsibility
for
secession
and
they
were
stripped
of
the
support
of
the
prostrate
south
not
until
the
last
southern
state
was
restored
to
the
union
not
until
a
general
amnesty
was
wrung
from
congress
not
until
white
supremacy
was
established
at
the
polls
and
the
last
federal
soldier
withdrawn
from
southern
capitals
did
they
succeed
in
capturing
the
presidency
the
opportune
moment
for
them
came
in
when
a
number
of
circumstances
favored
their
aspirations
the
republicans
leaving
the
ohio
valley
in
their
search
for
a
candidate
nominated
james
blaine
of
maine
a
vigorous
and
popular
leader
but
a
man
under
fire
from
the
reformers
in
his
own
party
the
democrats
on
their
side
were
able
to
find
at
this
juncture
an
able
candidate
who
had
no
political
enemies
in
the
sphere
of
national
politics
grover
cleveland
then
governor
of
new
york
and
widely
celebrated
as
a
man
of
sterling
honesty
at
the
same
time

dissatisfied
republicans
openly
espoused
the
democratic
cause
among
them
carl

george
william
curtis
henry
ward
beecher
and
william
everett
men
of
fine
ideals

the
regular
republicans
called
them
mugwumps
and
laughed
at
them
as
the
men
milliners
the
dilettanti
and
carpet
knights
of
politics
they
had
a
following
that
was
not
to
be
despised
the
campaign
which
took
place
that
year
was
one
of
the
most
savage
in
american
history
issues
were
thrust
into
the
background
the
tariff
though
mentioned
was
not
taken
seriously
abuse
of
the
opposition
was
the
favorite
resource
of
party
orators
the
democrats
insisted
that
the
republican
party
so
far
as
principle
is
concerned
is
a
reminiscence
in
practice
it
is
an
organization
for
enriching
those
who
control
its
machinery
for
the
republican
candidate
blaine
they
could
hardly
find
words
to
express
their
contempt
the
republicans
retaliated
in
kind
they
praised
their
own
good
works
as
of
old
in
saving
the
union
and
denounced
the
fraud
and
violence
practiced
by
the
democracy
in
the
southern
states
seeing
little
objectionable
in
the
public
record
of
cleveland
as
mayor
of
buffalo
and
governor
of
new
york
they
attacked
his
personal
character
perhaps
never
in
the
history
of
political
campaigns
did
the
discussions
on
the
platform
and
in
the
press
sink
to
so
low
a
level
decent
people
were
sickened
even
hot
partisans
shrank
from
their
own
words
when
after
the
election
they
had
time
to
reflect
on
their
heedless
passions
moreover
nothing
was
decided
by
the
balloting
cleveland
was
elected
but
his
victory
was
a
narrow
one
a
change

a

vicious
inequitable

got
his

on

he
took
an

foundation
of

for

and
the

indeed
he
neglected
no
opportunity
to
increase
the

on

lines
he
wanted
no
empty
cars
running
in
either
direction
and
no
wheat
stored
in

for
the
lack
of
markets
so
he
looked
to
the
orient
as
well
as
to
europe
as
an
outlet
for
the
surplus
of
the
farms
he
sent
agents
to

to
discover
what

and
produce

would
consume

what

they

relatively
slight
consequence
the
former
practice
of
treating
with
the
indians
as
independent
nations
was
abandoned
in
and
most
of
them
were
concentrated
in
reservations
where
they
were
mainly
supported
by
the
government
the
supervision
of
their
affairs
was
vested
in
a
board
of
commissioners
created
in
and
instructed
to
treat
them
as
wards
of
the
nation
a
trust
which
unfortunately
was
often
betrayed
a
further
step
in
indian
policy
was
taken
in
when
provision
was
made
for
issuing
lands
to
individual
indians
thus
permitting
them
to
become
citizens
and
settle
down
among
their
white
neighbors
as
farmers
or
cattle
raisers
the
disappearance
of

main

of

the
american

was
the
hero
in
this
scene
great
herds
of
cattle
were
bred
in
texas
with
the
advancing
spring
and
summer
seasons
they
were
driven
northward
across
the
plains
and
over
the
buffalo
trails
in
a
single
year
it
is
estimated
that
nearly
one
million
head
of
cattle
were
moved
out
of
texas
to
the
north
by
four
thousand
cowboys
supplied
with
horses
and
ponies
during
the
two
decades
from
to
both
the
cattle
men
and
the
sheep
raisers
had
an
almost
free
run
of
the
plains
using
public
lands
without
paying
for
the
privilege
and
waging
war
on
one
another
over
the
possession
of
ranges
at
length
however
both
had
to
go
as
the
homesteaders
and
land
companies
came
and
fenced
in
the
plain
and

with
endless
lines
of
barbed

lamented
the
passing
of
the
picturesque

the
unique
position
of
the
cowboys
among
the
americans
is

a
thousand
ways
towns
are
growing
up
on
their
pasture
lands
irrigation
schemes
of
a
dozen
sorts
threaten
to
turn
scenery
into
views
farmers
are
valleys
and
the
sides
of
waterways
and
the
day
is
not
far
distant
when
must
be
done
mainly
in
small
herds
with
winter
corrals
and
then
the
days
will
end
even
now
his
condition
disappoints
those
who
knew
him
only
half
a
dozen
years
ago
his
breed
seems
to
have
deteriorated
and
his
ranks
are
filling
with
men
who
work
for
wages
rather
than
for
the
love
of
the
free
life
and
bold
companionship
that
once
tempted

may
not
be

all
the
civil
authorities
in
nearly
all
towns
in
the
grazing
country
forbid
the
wearing
of
side
arms
nobody
shoots
up
these
towns
any
more
the
fact
is
the
old
cowboy
days
are
gone
already
under
the
homestead
act
of
two
factors
gave
a
special
stimulus
to
the
rapid
settlement
of
western
lands
which
swept
away
the
indians
and
the
cattle
rangers
the
first
was
the
policy
of
the
railway
companies
in
selling
large
blocks
of
land
received
from
the
government
at
low
prices
to
induce
immigration
the
second
was
the
operation
of
the
homestead
law
passed
in
this
measure
practically
closed
the
long
controversy
over
the
disposition
of
the
public
domain
that
was
suitable
for
agriculture
it
provided
for
granting
without
any
cost
save
a
small
registration
fee
public
lands
in
lots
of
acres
each
to
citizens
and
aliens
who
declared
their
intention
of
becoming
citizens
the
one
important
condition
attached
was
that
the
settler
should
occupy
the
farm
for
five
years
before
his
title
was
finally
confirmed
even
this
stipulation
was
waived
in
the
case
of
the
civil
war
veterans
who
were
allowed
to
count
their
term
of
military
service
as
a
part
of
the
five
years
occupancy
required
as
the
soldiers
of
the
revolutionary
and
mexican
wars
had
advanced
in
great
numbers
to
the
frontier
in
earlier
days
so
now
veterans
led
in
the
settlement
of
the
middle
border
along
with
them
went
thousands
of
german
irish
and
scandinavian
immigrants
fresh
from
the
old
world
between
and
acres
were
staked
out
in
farms
in
twenty
years
the
population
of
nebraska
leaped
from
to
almost
half
a
million
kansas
from
to
a
million
iowa
from
to
and
the
dakotas
from
to
diversity
of
western
in
soil

and
management
western
agriculture
presented
many
contrasts
to
that
of
the
east
and
south
in
the
region
of
arable
and
watered
lands
the
typical
american
unit
the
small
farm
tilled
by
the
owner
appeared
as
usual
but
by
the
side
of
it
many
a
huge
domain
owned
by
foreign
or
eastern
companies
and
tilled
by
hired
labor
sometimes
the
great
estate
took
the
shape
of
the
bonanza
farm
devoted
mainly
to
wheat
and
corn
and
cultivated
on
a
large
scale
by
machinery
again
it
assumed
the
form
of
the
cattle
ranch
embracing
tens
of
thousands
of
acres
again
it
was
a
vast
holding
of
diversified
interest
such
as
the
santa
anita
ranch
near
los
angeles
a
domain
of
acres
cultivated
in
a
glorious
sweep
of
vineyards
and
orange
and
olive
orchards
rich
sheep
and
cattle
pastures
and
horse
ranches
their
life
and
customs
handed
down
from
the
spanish
owners
of
the
various
ranches
which
were
swept
into
one
estate
in
one
respect
agriculture
in
the
far
west
was
unique
in
a
large
area
spreading
through
eight
states
montana
idaho
wyoming
utah
colorado
nevada
arizona
new
mexico
and
parts
of
adjoining
states
the
rainfall
was
so
slight
that
the
ordinary
crops
to
which
the
american
farmer
was
accustomed
could
not
be
grown
at
all
the
mormons
were
the
first
to
encounter
aridity
and
they
were
baffled
at
first
but
they
studied
it
and
mastered
it
by
magnificent
irrigation
systems
as
other
settlers
poured
into
the
west
the
problem
of
the
desert
was
attacked
with
a
will
some
of
them
replying
to
the
commiseration
of
eastern
farmers
by
saying
that
it
was
easier
to
scoop
out
an
irrigation
ditch
than
to
cut
forests
and
wrestle
with
stumps
and
stones
private
companies
bought
immense
areas
at
low
prices
built
irrigation
works
and
disposed
of
their
lands
in
small
plots
some
ranchers
with
an
instinct
for
water
like
that
of
the
miner
for
metal
sank
wells
into
the
dry
sand
and
were
rewarded
with
gushers
that
soused
the
thirsty
desert
and
turned
its
sand
into
loam
the
federal
government
came
to
the
aid
of
the
arid
regions
in
by
granting
lands
to
the
states
to
be
used
for
irrigation
purposes
in
this
work
wyoming
took
the
lead
with
a
law
which
induced
capitalists
to
invest
in
irrigation
and
at
the
same
time
provided
for
the
sale
of
the
redeemed
lands
to
actual
settlers
finally
in
the
federal
government
by
its
liberal
reclamation
act
added
its
strength
to
that
of

his
weapons
have

the

the
drill

and
the
enemy
which
he
has
conquered
has
been
the
most
stubborn
of
all
foes
the
hostile
forces
of
nature
the
story
of
how
the
white
man
within
the
space
of
less
than
thirty
years
penetrated
explored
and
mapped
this
almost
unknown
region
of
how
he
carried
law
order
and
justice
into
a
section
which
had
never
had
so
much
as
a
speaking
acquaintance
with
any
one
of
the
three
before
of
how
realizing
the
necessity
for
means
of
communication
he
built
highways
of
steel
across
this
territory
from
east
to
west
and
from
north
to
south
of
how
undismayed
by
the
savageness
of
the
countenance
which
the
desert
turned
upon
him
he
laughed
and
rolled
up
his
sleeves
and
spat
upon
his
hands
and
slashed
the
face
of
the
desert
with
canals
and
irrigating
ditches
and
filled
those
ditches
with
water
brought
from
deep
in
the
earth
or
high
in
the
mountains
and
of
how
in
the
conquered
and
submissive
soil
he
replaced
the
aloe
with
alfalfa
the
mesquite
with
maize
the
cactus
with
cotton
forms
one
of
the
most
inspiring
chapters
in
our
history
it
is
one
of
the
epics
of
civilization
this
reclamation
of
the
southwest
and
its
heroes
thank
god

americans
other
desert
regions
have
been
redeemed
by
irrigation
egypt
for
example
and
mesopotamia
and
parts
of
the
sudan
but
the
people
of
all
those
regions
lay
stretched
out
in
the
shade
of
a
convenient
palm
metaphorically
speaking
and
waited
for
some
one
with
more
energy
than
themselves
to
come
along
and
do
the
work
but
the
arizonians
mindful
of
the
fact
that
god
the
government
and

help
those
who
help
themselves
spent
their
days
wielding
the
pick
and
shovel
and
their
evenings
in
writing
letters
to
washington
with
hands
after
a
time
the
government
was
prodded
into
action
and
the
great
dams
at
laguna
and
roosevelt
are
the
result
then
the
people
organizing
themselves
into
coöperative
leagues
and
associations
took
up
the
work
of
reclamation
where
the
government
left
off
it
is
to
these
energetic
persevering
men
who
have
drilled
wells
plowed
fields
and
dug
ditches
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
that
great
region
which
stretches
from
yuma
to

that
the
metamorphosis
of
arizona
is
due
the
effect
of
irrigation
wherever
introduced
was
amazing
stretches
of
sand

gave
way
to
fertile
fields

crops
of

huge
ranches

by

sheep
were
broken
up
into
small

the

vanished
in
their
place
rose
the
prosperous

a
community
unlike
the
township
of
iowa
or
the
industrial
center
of
the
east
its
intensive
tillage
left
little
room
for
hired

its
small

drew
families
together
in
village
life
rather
than
dispersing
them
on
the
lonely

often
the
development
of
water
power
in
connection
with
irrigation
afforded
electricity
for
devices
and
lifted
many
a

that
was
in
the
predominance
of

over

throughout
a
vast
section
indeed
it
was
the
minerals
rather
than
the
land
that
attracted
the
pioneers
who
first
opened
the
country
the
discovery
of

in
california
in
was
the
signal
for
the
great
rush
of
prospectors
miners
and
promoters
who
explored
the

climbed
the
hills
washed
the

and
dug
up
the

in
their
feverish
search
for

minerals
continued
to
be

in

this
was
revealed
by

logging
the

of

unlike
those
of

proved
a
boon
to
the
pioneers
rather
than
a
foe
to
be
attacked
in
ohio
and
indiana
for
example
the

line
of

had
to
cut

thousands
of

before
they
could
put
out

there
were
all
ready
for
the

great
reaches

was
precious

good
use
of

consumed

tribute
upon

annual
upkeep

as
had
burdened
the
pioneers
of
the
northwest
territory
a
hundred
years
before
they
carried
off
to
markets
on
the
east
and
west
coasts
the
peculiar
conditions
of
the
far
west
stimulated
a
rise
of
industries
more
rapid
than
is
usual
in

the
mining
activities
which
in
many
sections
preceded
agriculture
called
for
sawmills
to
furnish
timber
for
the
mines
and
smelters
to
reduce
and
refine
ores
the
ranches
supplied
sheep
and

ended
in

factories
for

preceded

and
furnished
a
ready
outlet
for

manufactures
so
they
encouraged
the
early
establishment
of
varied
industries
thus
creating
a
state
of
affairs
quite
unlike

which

in
part
by

and
in
part
by
migratory
seasonal
labor
summoned
from
all
sections
of
the
country
for
the

the

created
hundreds
of
huge
fortunes
which
made
the

still

he
was
a
conspicuous
and

sometimes
invested

the

have
constituted
a
highly
impressive
class

many
of
the
early
capitalists
of
the

especially
from

spent
their

principally
in

to
the
promotion
of

scheme
while
the
far
west
was
developing
this
vigorous
aggressive
leadership
in
business
a
considerable
industrial
population
was
springing
up
even
the
cattle
ranges
and
hundreds
of
farms
were
conducted
like
factories
in
that
they
were
managed
through
overseers
who
hired
plowmen
harvesters
and
cattlemen
at
regular
wages
at
the
same
time
there
appeared
other
peculiar
features
which
made
a
lasting
impression
on
western
economic
life
mining
lumbering
and
fruit
growing
for
instance
employed
thousands
of
workers
during
the
rush
months
and
turned
them
out
at
other
times
the
inevitable
result
was
an
army
of
migratory
laborers
wandering
from
camp
to
camp
from
town
to
town
and
from
ranch
to
ranch
without
fixed
homes
or
established
habits
of
life
from
this
extraordinary
condition
there
issued
many
a
long
and
lawless
conflict
between
capital
and
labor
giving
a
distinct
color
to
the
labor
movement
in
whole
sections
of
the
mountain
and
coast
states
the
admission
of
new
states
spirit
of
the
instinct
of
was
strong
in
the
western
communities
in
the
very
beginning
it
led
to
the
organization
of
volunteer
committees
known
as
vigilantes
to
suppress
crime
and
punish
criminals
as
soon
as
enough
people
were
settled
permanently
in
a
region
they
took
care
to
form
a
more
stable
kind
of
government
an
illustration
of
this
process
is
found
in
the
oregon
compact
made
by
the
pioneers
in
the
spirit
of
which
is
reflected
in
an
editorial
in
an
old
copy
of
the
mountain
we
claim
that
any
body
or
community
of
american
citizens
which
from
any
cause
or
under
any
circumstances
is
cut
off
from
or
from
isolation
is
so
situated
as
not
to
be

branch
of

a
right
if
on

soil
to
frame
a

enact
such
laws
and
regulations
as
may
be
necessary
for
their
own
safety
protection
and
happiness
always
with
the
condition
precedent
that
they
shall
at
the
earliest
moment
when
the
central

shall
extend
an
effective
organization
and

over
them
give
it
their
unqualified
support
and
obedience
people
who
turned
so
naturally
to
the
organization
of
local
administration
were
equally
eager
for
admission
to
the
union
as
soon
as
any
shadow
of
a
claim
to
statehood
could
be
advanced
as
long
as
a
region
was
merely
one
of
the
territories
of
the
united
states
the
appointment
of
the
governor
and
other
officers
was
controlled
by
politics
at
washington
moreover
the
disposition
of
land
mineral
rights
forests
and
water
power
was
also
in
the
hands
of
national
leaders
thus
practical
considerations
were
united
with
the
spirit
of
independence
in
the
quest
for
local
autonomy
and
two
states
nebraska
and
colorado
had
little
difficulty
in
securing
admission
to
the
union
the
first
nebraska
had
been
organized
as
a
territory
by
the
famous
bill
which
did
so
much
to
precipitate
the
civil
war
lying
to
the
north
of
kansas
which
had
been
admitted
in
it
escaped
the
invasion
of
slave
owners
from
missouri
and
was
settled
mainly
by
farmers
from
the
north
though
it
claimed
a
population
of
only
it
was
regarded
with
kindly
interest
by
the
republican
congress
at
washington
and
reduced
to
its
present
boundaries
it
received
the
coveted
statehood
in
this
was
hardly
accomplished
before
the
people
of
colorado
to
the
southwest
began
to
make
known
their
demands
they
had
been
organized
under
territorial
government
in
when
they
numbered
only
a
handful
but
within
ten
years
the
aspect
of
their
affairs
had
completely
changed
the
silver
and
gold
deposits
of
the
leadville
and
cripple
creek
regions
had
attracted
an
army
of
miners
and
prospectors
the

founded
in
and
named
after
the
governor
of
kansas
whence
came
many
of
the
early

grown
from
a
straggling
camp
of
log
huts
into
a
prosperous
center
of
trade
by
it
was
reckoned
that
the
population
of
the
territory
was
not
less
than
one
hundred
thousand
the
following
year
congress
yielding
to
the
popular
appeal
made
colorado
a
member
of
the
american
union
new
states
for
many
years
there
was
a
deadlock
in
congress
over
the
admission
of
new
states
the
spell
was
broken
in
under
the
leadership
of
the
dakotas
for
a
long
time
the
dakota
territory
organized
in
had
been
looked
upon
as
the
home
of
the
powerful
sioux
indians
whose
enormous
reservation
blocked
the
advance
of
the
frontier
the
discovery
of
gold
in
the
black
hills
however
marked
their
doom
even
before
congress
could
open
their
lands
to
prospectors
pioneers
were
swarming
over
the
country
farmers
from
the
adjoining
minnesota
and
the
eastern
states
scandinavians
germans
and
canadians
came
in
swelling
waves
to
occupy
the
fertile
dakota
lands
now
famous
even
as
far
away
as
the
fjords
of
norway
seldom
had
the
plow
of
man
cut
through
richer
soil
than
was
found
in
the
bottoms
of
the
red
river
valley
and
it
became
all
the
more
precious
when
the
opening
of
the
northern
pacific
in
afforded
a
means
of
transportation
east
and
west
the
population
which
had
numbered
in
passed
the
half
million
mark
before
ten
years
had
elapsed
remembering
that
nebraska
had
been
admitted
with
only
inhabitants
the
dakotans
could
not
see
why
they
should
be
kept
under
federal
tutelage
at
the
same
time
washington
far
away
on
the
pacific
coast
montana
idaho
and
wyoming
boasting
of
their
populations
and
their
riches
put
in
their
own
eloquent
pleas
but
the
members
of
congress
were
busy
with
politics
the
democrats
saw
no
good
reason
for
admitting
new
republican
states
until
after
their
defeat
in
near
the
end
of
their
term
the
next
year
they
opened
the
door
for
north
and
south
dakota
washington
and
montana
in
a
republican
congress
brought
idaho
and
wyoming
into
the
union
the
latter
with
woman
suffrage
which
had
been
granted
years
before
although
utah
had
long
presented
all
the
elements
of
a
and
industrious
community
its
admission
to
the
union
was
delayed
on
account
of
popular
hostility
to
the
practice
of
polygamy
the
custom
it
is
true
had
been
prohibited
by
act
of
congress
in
but
the
law
had
been
systematically
evaded
in
congress
made
another
and
more
effective
effort
to
stamp
out
polygamy
five
years
later
it
even
went
so
far
as
to
authorize
the
confiscation
of
the
property
of
the
mormon
church
in
case
the
practice
of
plural
marriages
was
not
stopped
meanwhile
the
gentile
or
population
was
steadily
increasing
and
the
leaders
in
the
church
became
convinced
that
the
battle
against
the
sentiment
of
the
country
was
futile
at
last
in
utah
was
admitted
as
a
state
under
a
constitution
which
forbade
plural
marriages
absolutely
and
forever
horace

visited
utah
in

prophesied
that
the
pacific
railroad
would
work
a

marked
by
all
the

travelers
were

that
country
in

cars
and
enjoying
at
the

all
the
comforts
of
a
standardized
civilization
the
wild
west
was
gone
and
with
it
that
frontier
of
pioneers
and
settlers
who
had
long
given
such
a
bent
and
tone
to
american
life
and
had
poured
in
upon
the
floor
of
congress
such
a
long
line
of
backwoods
politicians
as
they
were
scornfully
styled
land
and
eastern
it
was
not
only
the
picturesque
features
of
the
frontier
that
were
gone
of
far
more
consequence
was
the
disappearance
of
free
lands
with
all
that
meant
for
american
labor
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
any
man
of
even
moderate
means
had
been
able
to
secure
a
homestead
of
his
own
and
an
independent
livelihood
for
a
hundred
years
america
had
been
able
to
supply
farms
to
as
many
immigrants
as
cared
to
till
the
soil
every
new
pair
of
strong
arms
meant
more
farms
and
more
wealth
workmen
in
eastern
factories
mines
or
mills
who
did
not
like
their
hours
wages
or
conditions
of
labor
could
readily
find
an
outlet
to
the
land
now
all
that
was
over
by
about
most
of
the
desirable
land
available
under
the
homestead
act
had
disappeared
american
industrial
workers
confronted
a
new
situation
supplants
king
in
the
meantime
a
revolution
was
taking
place
in
agriculture
until
the
chief
staples
sold
by
america
were
cotton
and
tobacco
with
the
advance
of
the
frontier
corn
and
wheat
supplanted
them
both
in
agrarian
economy
the
west
became
the
granary
of
the
east
and
of
western
europe
the
scoop
shovel
once
used
to
handle
grain
was
superseded
by
the
towering
elevator
loading
and
unloading
thousands
of
bushels
every
hour
the
refrigerator
car
and
ship
made
the
packing
industry
as
stable
as
the
production
of
cotton
or
corn
and
gave
an
immense
impetus
to
cattle
raising
and
sheep
farming
so
the
meat
of
the
west
took
its
place
on
the
english
dinner
table
by
the
side
of
bread
baked
from
dakotan
wheat
in
american
economic
the
effects
of
this
economic
movement
were
manifold
and
striking
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
american
grain
dairy
produce
and
meat
were
poured
into
european
markets
where
they
paid
off
debts
due
money
lenders
and
acquired
capital
to
develop
american
resources
thus
they
accelerated
the
progress
of
american
financiers
toward
national
independence
the
country
which
had
timidly
turned
to
the
old
world
for
capital
in
hamilton
day
and
had
borrowed
at
high
rates
of
interest
in
london
in
lincoln
day
moved
swiftly
toward
the
time
when
it
would
be
among
the
world
first
bankers
and
money
lenders
itself
every
grain
of
wheat
and
corn
pulled
the
balance
down
on
the
american
side
of
the
scale
agriculture
in
the
east
as
well
as
abroad
the
opening
of
the
western
granary
produced
momentous
results
the
agricultural
economy
of
that
part
of
the
country
was
changed
in
many
respects
whole
sections
of
the
poorest
land
went
almost
out
of
cultivation
the
abandoned
farms
of
the
new
england
hills
bearing
solemn
witness
to
the
competing
power
of
western
wheat
fields
sheep
and
cattle
raising
as
well
as
wheat
and
corn
production
suffered
at
least
a
relative
decline
thousands
of
farmers
cultivating
land
of
the
lower
grade
were
forced
to
go
west
or
were
driven
to
the
margin
of
subsistence
even
the
herds
that
supplied
eastern
cities
with
milk
were
fed
upon
grain
brought
halfway
across
the
continent
expansion
of
the
american
upon
industry
as
well
as
agriculture
the
opening
of
vast
regions
told
in
a
thousand
ways
the
demand
for
farm
machinery
clothing
boots
shoes
and
other
manufactures
gave
to
american
industries
such
a
market
as
even
hamilton
had
never
foreseen
moreover
it
helped
to
expand
far
into
the
mississippi
valley
the
industrial
area
once
confined
to
the
northern
seaboard
states
and
to
transform
the
region
of
the
great
lakes
into
an
industrial
empire
herein
lies
the
explanation
of
the
growth
of
cities
after
chicago
with
its
railways
tapped
every
locality
of
the
west
and
south
to
the
railways
were
added
the
water
routes
of
the
lakes
thus
creating
a
strategic
center
for
industries
long
foresight
carried
the
mccormick
reaper
works
to
chicago
before
from
troy
new
york
went
a
large
stove
plant
that
was
followed
by
a
shoe
factory
from
massachusetts
the
packing
industry
rose
as
a
matter
of
course
at
a
point
so
advantageous
for
cattle
raisers
and
shippers
and
so
well
connected
with
eastern
markets
to
the
opening
of
the
far
west
also
the
lake
region
was
indebted
for
a
large
part
of
that
traffic
which
made
it
the
mediterranean
basin
of
north
america
the
produce
of
the
west
and
the
manufactures
of
the
east
poured
through
it
in
an
endless
stream
the
swift
growth
of
shipbuilding
on
the
great
lakes
helped
to
compensate
for
the
decline
of
the
american
marine
on
the
high
seas
in
response
to
this
stimulus
detroit
could
boast
that
her
shipwrights
were
able
to
turn
out
a
ten
thousand
ton
leviathan
for
ore
or
grain
about
as
quickly
as
carpenters
could
put
up
an
house
thus
in
relation
to
the
far
west
the
old
northwest
territory
the
wilderness
of
jefferson
time
had
taken
the
position
formerly
occupied
by
new
england
alone
it
was
supplying
capital
and
manufactures
for
a
vast
agricultural
empire
west
and
south
on
the
it
has
been
said
that
the
mediterranean
sea
was
the
center
of
ancient
civilization
that
modern
civilization
has
developed
on
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
and
that
the
future
belongs
to
the
pacific
at
any
rate
the
sweep
of
the
united
states
to
the
shores
of
the
pacific
quickly
exercised
a
powerful
influence
on
world
affairs
and
it
undoubtedly
has
a
still
greater
significance
for
the
future
very
early
regular
traffic
sprang
up
between
the
pacific
ports
and
the
hawaiian
islands
china
and
japan
two
years
before
the
adjustment
of
the
oregon
controversy
with
england
namely
in
the
united
states
had
established
official
and
trading
relations
with
china
ten
years
later
four
years
after
the
admission
of
california
to
the
union
the
barred
door
of
japan
was
forced
open
by
commodore
perry
the
commerce
which
had
long
before
developed
between
the
pacific
ports
and
hawaii
china
and
japan
now
flourished
under
official
care
in
a
ship
from
honolulu
carried
sugar
molasses
and
fruits
from
hawaii
to
the
oregon
port
of
astoria
the
next
year
a
vessel
from
hongkong
brought
rice
mats
and
tea
from
china
an
era
of
lucrative
trade
was
opened
the
annexation
of
hawaii
in
the
addition
of
the
philippines
at
the
same
time
and
the
participation
of
american
troops
in
the
suppression
of
the
boxer
rebellion
in
peking
in
were
but

and
symbols
of
american
power
on

pacific
illustration
an
old
commodore
perry
men
making
presents
to
the
japanese
and
the
land
the
disappearance
of
the
frontier
also
brought
new
and
serious
problems
to
the
governments
of
the
states
and
the
nation
the
people
of
the
whole
united
states
suddenly
were
forced
to
realize
that
there
was
a
limit
to
the
rich
new
land
to
exploit
and
to
the
forests
and
minerals
awaiting
the
ax
and
the
pick
then
arose
in
america
the
questions
which
had
long
perplexed
the
countries
of
the
old
world
the
scientific
use
of
the
soils
and
conservation
of
natural
resources
hitherto
the
government
had
followed
the
easy
path
of
giving
away
arable
land
and
selling
forest
and
mineral
lands
at
low
prices
now
it
had
to
face
far
more
difficult
and
complex
problems
it
also
had
to
consider
questions
of
land
tenure
again
especially
if
the
ideal
of
a
nation
of
farmers
was
to
be
maintained
while
there
was
plenty
of
land
for
every
man
or
woman
who
wanted
a
home
on
the
soil
it
made
little
difference
if
single
landlords
or
companies
got
possession
of
millions
of
acres
if
a
hundred
men
in
one
western
river
valley
owned
acres
but
when
the
good
land
for
small
homesteads
was
all
gone
then
was
raised
the
real
issue
at
the
opening
of
the
twentieth
century
the
nation
which
a
hundred
years
before
had
land
and
natural
resources
apparently
without
limit
was
compelled
to
enact
law
after
law
conserving
its
forests
and
minerals
then
it
was
that
the
great
state
of
california
on
the
very
border
of
the
continent
felt
constrained
to
enact
a
land
settlement
measure
providing
government
assistance
in
an
effort
to
break
up
large
holdings
into
small
lots
and
to
make
it

to
acquire
small

were

spoke
cautiously

considerable

again
and
again
the
votes

showed
that
no
clear
line
separated
all
the
democrats
from
all
the
republicans
there
were
republicans
who
favored
tariff

there
were

looked
with

only
on
matters

the

grounds

but
reflect
the
confusion
of

prevailing

that
out
of

held

for
fourteen
years

altogether
at

held
in

of

the
opinion

the

nevertheless
these
years
of

politics

nebulous
issues
proved
to
be
a
period
in
which
social
forces
were
gathering
for
the
great
campaign
of
except
for
three
new
features
the
railways
the
trusts
and
the
trade
unions
the
subjects
of
debate
among
the
people
were
the
same
as
those
that
had
engaged
their
attention
since
the
foundation
of
the
republic
the
currency
the
national
debt
banking
the
tariff
and
taxation
and
the
fall
in
for
many
reasons
the
currency
question
occupied
the
center
of
interest
as
of
old
the
farmers
and
planters
of
the
west
and
south
were
heavily
in
debt
to
the
east
for
borrowed
money
secured
by
farm
mortgages
and
they
counted
upon
the
sale
of
cotton
corn
wheat
and
hogs
to
meet
interest
and
principal
when
due
during
the
war
the
western
farmers
had
been
able
to
dispose
of
their
produce
at
high
prices
and
thus
discharge
their
debts
with
comparative
ease
but
after
the
war
prices
declined
wheat
that
sold
at
two
dollars
a
bushel
in
brought
cents
twenty
years
later
the
meaning
of
this
for
the
farmers
in
debt
and
nearly
of
them
were
in
that
class
can
be
shown
by
a
single
illustration
a
mortgage
on
a
western
farm
could
be
paid
off
by
five
hundred
bushels
of
wheat
when
prices
were
high
whereas
it
took
about
fifteen
hundred
bushels
to
pay
the
same
debt
when
wheat
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
scale
for
the
farmer
it
must
be
remembered
wheat
was
the
measure
of
his
labor
the
product
of
his
toil
under
the
summer
sun
and
in
its
price
he
found
the
test
of
his
prosperity
and
falling
to
the
bondholders
or
creditors
on
the
other
hand
falling
prices
were
clear
gain
if
a
coupon
on
a
bond
bought
seventy
or
eighty
bushels
of
wheat
instead
of
twenty
or
thirty
the
advantage
to
the
owner
of
the
coupon
was
obvious
moreover
the
advantage
seemed
to
him
entirely
just
creditors
had
suffered
heavy
losses
when
the
civil
war
carried
prices
skyward
while
the
interest
rates
on
their
old
bonds
remained
stationary
for
example
if
a
man
had
a
bond
issued
before
and
paying
interest
at
five
per
cent
he
received
fifty
dollars
a
year
from
it
before
the
war
each
dollar
would
buy
a
bushel
of
wheat
in
it
would
only
buy
half
a
bushel
when
prices
that
is
the
cost
of
living
began
to
go
down
creditors
therefore
generally
regarded
the
change
with
satisfaction
as
a
return
to
normal
conditions
cause
of
falling
the
fall
in
prices
was
due
no
doubt
to
many
factors
among
them
must
be
reckoned
the
discontinuance
of
government
buying
for
war
purposes
farm
machinery
immigration
and
the
opening
of
new
regions
the
currency
too
was
an
element
in
the
situation
whatever
the
cause
the
discontented
farmers
believed
that
the
way
to
raise
prices
was
to
issue
more
money
they
viewed
it
as
a
case
of
supply
and
demand
if
there
was
a
small
volume
of
currency
in
circulation
prices
would
be
low
if
there
was
a
large
volume
prices
would
be
high
hence
they
looked
with
favor
upon
all
plans
to
increase
the
amount
of
money
in
circulation
first
they
advocated
more
paper
notes
greenbacks
and
then
they
turned
to
silver
as
the
remedy
the
creditors
on
the
other
hand
naturally
approved
the
reduction
of
the
volume
of
currency
they
wished
to
see
the
greenbacks
withdrawn
from
circulation
and
gold
a
metal
more
limited
in
volume
than
silver
made
the
sole
basis
of
the
national
monetary
system
battle
over
the
the
contest
between
these
factions
began
as
early
as
in
that
year
congress
enacted
a
law
authorizing
the
treasury
to
withdraw
the
greenbacks
from
circulation
the
paper
money
party
set
up
a
shrill
cry
of
protest
and
kept
up
the
fight
until
in
it
forced
congress
to
provide
for
the
continuous
of
the
legal
tender
notes
as
they
came
into
the
treasury
in
payment
of
taxes
and
other
dues
then
could
the
friends
of
easy
money
rejoice
thou
greenback
is
of
thee
fair
money
of
the
free
of
thee
we
sing
of
specie
there
was
however
another
side
to
this
victory
the
opponents
of
the
greenbacks
unable
to
stop
the
circulation
of
paper
induced
congress
to
pass
a
law
in
providing
that
on
and
after
january
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
shall
redeem
in
coin
the
united
states
legal
tender
notes
then
outstanding
on
their
presentation
at
the
office
of
the
assistant
treasurer
of
the
united
states
in
the
city
of
new
york
in
sums
of
not
less
than
fifty
dollars
the
way
to
resume
john
sherman
had
said
is
to
resume
when
the
hour
for
redemption
arrived
the
treasury
was
prepared
with
a
large
hoard
of
gold
on
the
appointed
day
wrote
the
assistant
secretary
anxiety
reigned
in
the
office
of
the
treasury
hour
after
hour
passed
no
news
from
new
york
inquiry
by
wire
showed
that
all
was
quiet
at
the
close
of
the
day
this
message
came
of
notes
presented
for
coin
of
gold
for
notes
that
was
all
resumption
was
accomplished
with
no
disturbance
by
five
the
news
was
all
over
the
land
and
the
new
york
bankers
were
sipping
their
tea
in
absolute
safety
specie
problem
the
parity
of
gold
and
defeated
in
their
efforts
to
stop
the
present
suicidal
and
destructive
policy
of
contraction
the
advocates
of
an
abundant
currency
demanded
an
increase
in
the
volume
of
silver
in
circulation
this
precipitated
one
of
the
sharpest
political
battles
in
american
history
the
issue
turned
on
legal
as
well
as
economic
points
the
constitution
gave
congress
the
power
to
coin
money
and
it
forbade
the
states
to
make
anything
but
gold
and
silver
legal
tender
in
the
payment
of
debts
it
evidently
contemplated
the
use
of
both
metals
in
the
currency
system
such
at
least
was
the
view
of
many
eminent
statesmen
including
no
less
a
personage
than
james
blaine
the
difficulty
however
lay
in
maintaining
gold
and
silver
coins
on
a
level
which
would
permit
them
to
circulate
with
equal
facility
obviously
if
the
gold
in
a
gold
dollar
exceeds
the
value
of
the
silver
in
a
silver
dollar
on
the
open
market
men
will
hoard
gold
money
and
leave
silver
money
in
circulation
when
for
example
congress
in
fixed
the
ratio
of
the
two
metals
at
one
to
fifteen
one
ounce
of
gold
declared
worth
fifteen
of
silver
it
was
soon
found
that
gold
had
been
undervalued
when
again
in
the
ratio
was
put
at
one
to
sixteen
it
was
found
that
silver
was
undervalued
consequently
the
latter
metal
was
not
brought
in
for
coinage
and
silver
almost
dropped
out
of
circulation
many
a
silver
dollar
was
melted
down
by
silverware
factories
demonetized
in
so
things
stood
in
at
that
time
congress
in
enacting
a
mintage
law
discontinued
the
coinage
of
the
standard
silver
dollar
then
practically
out
of
circulation
this
act
was
denounced
later
by
the
friends
of
silver
as
the
crime
of
a
conspiracy
devised
by
the
money
power
and
secretly
carried
out
this
contention
the
debates
in
congress
do
not
seem
to
sustain
in
the
course
of
the
argument
on
the
mint
law
it
was
distinctly
said
by
one
speaker
at
least
this
bill
provides
for
the
making
of
changes
in
the
legal
tender
coin
of
the
country
and
for
substituting
as
legal
tender
coin
of
only
one
metal
instead
of
two
as
heretofore
decline
in
the
value
of
absorbed
in
the
greenback
controversy
the
people
apparently
did
not
appreciate
at
the
time
the
significance
of
the
demonetization
of
silver
but
within
a
few
years
several
events
united
in
making
it
the
center
of
a
political
storm
germany
having
abandoned
silver
in
steadily
increased
her
demand
for
gold
three
years
later
the
countries
of
the
latin
union
followed
this
example
thus
helping
to
enhance
the
price
of
the
yellow
metal
all
the
while
new
silver
lodes
discovered
in
the
far
west
were
pouring
into
the
market
great
streams
of
the
white
metal
bearing
down
the
price
then
came
the
resumption
of
specie
payment
which
in
effect
placed
the
paper
money
on
a
gold
basis
within
twenty
years
silver
was
worth
in
gold
only
about
half
the
price
of
that
there
had
been
a
real
decline
in
silver
was
denied
by
the
friends
of
that
metal
they
alleged
that
gold
had
gone
up
because
it
had
been
given
a
monopoly
in
the
coinage
markets
of
civilized
governments
this
monopoly
they
continued
was
the
fruit
of
a
conspiracy
against
the
people
conceived
by
the
bankers
of
the
world
moreover
they
went
on
the
placing
of
the
greenbacks
on
a
gold
basis
had
itself
worked
a
contraction
of
the
currency
it
lowered
the
prices
of
labor
and
produce
to
the
advantage
of
the
holders
of
investments
bearing
a
fixed
rate
of
interest
when
wheat
sold
at
cents
a
bushel
their
search
for
relief
became
desperate
and
they
at
last
concentrated
their
efforts
on
opening
the
mints
of
the
government
for
the
free
coinage
of
silver
at
the
ratio
of
sixteen
to
one
and
democrats
on
this
question
both
republicans
and
democrats
were
divided
the
line
being
drawn
between
the
east
on
the
one
hand
and
the
south
and
west
on
the
other
rather
than
between
the
two
leading
parties
so
trusted
a
leader
as
james
blaine
avowed
in
a
speech
delivered
in
the
senate
in
that
as
the
constitution
required
congress
to
make
both
gold
and
silver
the
money
of
the
land
the
only
question
left
was
that
of
fixing
the
ratio
between
them
he
affirmed
moreover
the
main
contention
of
the
silver
faction
that
a
reopening
of
the
government
mints
of
the
world
to
silver
would
bring
it
up
to
its
old
relation
with
gold
he
admitted
also
that
their
most
ominous
warnings
were
well
founded
saying
i
believe
the
struggle
now
going
on
in
this
country
and
in
other
countries
for
a
single
gold
standard
would
if
successful
produce
widespread
disaster
throughout
the
commercial
world
the
destruction
of
silver
as
money
and
the
establishment
of
gold
as
the
sole
unit
of
value
must
have
a
ruinous
effect
on
all
forms
of
property
except
those
investments
which
yield
a
fixed
return
this
was
exactly
the
concession
that
the
silver
party
wanted
of
the
business
enterprises
of
this
country
are
conducted
on
borrowed
capital
said
senator
jones
of
nevada
of
the
homes
and
farms
that
stand
in
the
names
of
the
actual
occupants
have
been
bought
on
time
and
a
very
large
proportion
of
them
are
mortgaged
for
the
payment
of
some
part
of
the
purchase
money
under
the
operation
of
a
shrinkage
in
the
volume
of
money
this
enormous
mass
of
borrowers
at
the
maturity
of
their
respective
debts
though
nominally
paying
no
more
than
the
amount
borrowed
with
interest
are
in
reality
in
the
amount
of
the
principal
alone
returning
a
percentage
of
value
greater
than
they
received
more
in
equity
than
they
contracted
to
pay
in
all
discussions
of
the
subject
the
creditors
attempt
to
brush
aside
the
equities
involved
by
sneering
at
the
debtors
silver
purchase
act
even
before
the
actual
resumption
of
specie
payment
the
advocates
of
free
silver
were
a
power
to
be
reckoned
with
particularly
in
the
democratic
party
they
had
a
majority
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
and
they
carried
a
silver
bill
through
that
chamber
blocked
by
the
republican
senate
they
accepted
a
compromise
in
the
bill
which
provided
for
huge
monthly
purchases
of
silver
by
the
government
for
coinage
into
dollars
so
strong
was
the
sentiment
that
a
majority
was
mustered
after
president
hayes
vetoed
the
measure
the
effect
of
this
act
as
some
had
anticipated
was
disappointing
it
did
not
stay
silver
on
its
downward
course
thereupon
the
silver
faction
pressed
through
congress
in
a
bill
providing
for
the
issue
of
paper
certificates
based
on
the
silver
accumulated
in
the
treasury
still
silver
continued
to
fall
then
the
advocates
of
inflation
declared
that
they
would
be
content
with
nothing
short
of
free
coinage
at
the
ratio
of
sixteen
to
one
if
the
issue
had
been
squarely
presented
in
there
is
good
reason
for
believing
that
free
silver
would
have
received
a
majority
in
both
houses
of
congress
but
it
was
not
presented
sherman
silver
purchase
act
and
the
bond
republican
leaders
particularly
from
the
east
stemmed
the
silver
tide
by
a
diversion
of
forces
they
passed
the
sherman
act
of
providing
for
large
monthly
purchases
of
silver
and
for
the
issue
of
notes
redeemable
in
gold
or
silver
at
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
a
clause
of
superb
ambiguity
they
announced
that
it
was
the
established
policy
of
the
united
states
to
maintain
the
two
metals
on
a
parity
with
each
other
upon
the
present
legal
ratio
or
such
other
ratio
as
may
be
provided
by
law
for
a
while
silver
was
buoyed
up
then
it
turned
once
more
on
its
downward
course
in
the
meantime
the
treasury
was
in
a
sad
plight
to
maintain
the
gold
reserve
president
cleveland
felt
compelled
to
sell
government
bonds
and
to
his
dismay
he
found
that
as
soon
as
the
gold
was
brought
in
at
the
front
door
of
the
treasury
notes
were
presented
for
redemption
and
the
gold
was
quickly
carried
out
at
the
back
door
alarmed
at
the
vicious
circle
thus
created
he
urged
upon
congress
the
repeal
of
the
sherman
silver
purchase
act
for
this
he
was
roundly
condemned
by
many
of
his
own
followers
who
branded
his
conduct
as
treason
to
the
party
but
the
republicans
especially
from
the
east
came
to
his
rescue
and
in
swept
the
troublesome
sections
of
the
law
from
the
statute
book
the
anger
of
the
silver
faction
knew
no
bounds
and
the
leaders
made
ready
for
the
approaching
presidential
campaign
the
protective
tariff
and
taxation
in
tariff
as
each
of
the
old
parties
was
divided
on
the
currency
question
it
is
not
surprising
that
there
was
some
confusion
in
their
ranks
over
the
tariff
like
the
silver
issue
the
tariff
tended
to
align
the
manufacturing
east
against
the
agricultural
west
and
south
rather
than
to
cut
directly
between
the
two
parties
still
the
republicans
on
the
whole
stood
firmly
by
the
rates
imposed
during
the
civil
war
if
we
except
the
reductions
of
which
were
soon
offset
by
increases
we
may
say
that
those
rates
were
substantially
unchanged
for
nearly
twenty
years
when
a
revision
was
brought
about
however
it
was
initiated
by
republican
leaders
seeing
a
huge
surplus
of
revenue
in
the
treasury
in
they
anticipated
popular
clamor
by
revising
the
tariff
on
the
theory
that
it
ought
to
be
reformed
by
its
friends
rather
than
by
its
enemies
on
the
other
hand
it
was
the
republicans
also
who
enacted
the
mckinley
tariff
bill
of
which
carried
protection
to
its
highest
point
up
to
that
time
the
democrats
on
their
part
were
not
all
confirmed
free
traders
or
even
advocates
of
tariff
for
revenue
only
in
cleveland
first
administration
they
did
attack
the
protective
system
in
the
house
where
they
had
a
majority
and
in
this
they
were
vigorously
supported
by
the
president
the
assault
however
proved
to
be
a
futile
gesture
for
it
was
blocked
by
the
republicans
in
the
senate
when
after
the
sweeping
victory
of
the
democrats
in
the
house
again
attempted
to
bring
down
the
tariff
by
the
wilson
bill
of
they
were
checkmated
by
their
own
party
colleagues
in
the
upper
chamber
in
the
end
they
were
driven
into
a
compromise
that
looked
more
like
a
mckinley
than
a
calhoun
tariff
the
republicans
taunted
them
with
being
babes
in
the
woods
president
cleveland
was
so
dissatisfied
with
the
bill
that
he
refused
to
sign
it
allowing
it
to
become
a
law
on
the
lapse
of
ten
days
without
his
approval
income
tax
of
the
advocates
of
tariff
reduction
usually
associated
with
their
proposal
a
tax
on
incomes
the
argument
which
they
advanced
in
support
of
their
program
was
simple
most
of
the
industries
they
said
are
in
the
east
and
the
protective
tariff
which
taxes
consumers
for
the
benefit
of
manufacturers
is
in
effect
a
tribute
laid
upon
the
rest
of
the
country
as
an
offset
they
offered
a
tax
on
large
incomes
this
owing
to
the
heavy
concentration
of
rich
people
in
the
east
would
fall
mainly
upon
the
beneficiaries
of
protection
we
propose
said
one
of
them
to
place
a
part
of
the
burden
upon
the
accumulated
wealth
of
the
country
instead
of
placing
it
all
upon
the
consumption
of
the
people
in
this
spirit
the
sponsors
of
the
wilson
tariff
bill
laid
a
tax
upon
all
incomes
of
a
year
or
more
in
taking
this
step
the
democrats
encountered
opposition
in
their
own
party
senator
hill
of
new
york
turned
fiercely
upon
them
exclaiming
the
professors
with
their
books
the
socialists
with
their
schemes
the
anarchists
with
their
bombs
are
all
instructing
the
people
in
the
principles
of
taxation
even
the
eastern
republicans
were
hardly
as
savage
in
their
denunciation
of
the
tax
but
all
this
labor
was
wasted
the
next
year
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
declared
the
income
tax
to
be
a
direct
tax
and
therefore
null
and
void
because
it
was
laid
on
incomes
wherever
found
and
not
apportioned
among
the
states
according
to
population
the
fact
that
four
of
the
nine
judges
dissented
from
this
decision
was
also
an
index
to
the
diversity
of
opinion
that
divided
both
parties
the
railways
and
trusts
grangers
and
state
the
same
uncertainty
about
the
railways
and
trusts
pervaded
the
ranks
of
the
republicans
and
democrats
as
to
the
railways
the
first
firm
and
consistent
demand
for
their
regulation
came
from
the
west
there
the
farmers
in
the
early
seventies
having
got
control
in
state
legislatures
particularly
in
iowa
wisconsin
and
illinois
enacted
drastic
laws
prescribing
the
maximum
charges
which
companies
could
make
for
carrying
freight
and
passengers
the
application
of
these
measures
however
was
limited
because
the
state
could
not
fix
the
rates
for
transporting
goods
and
passengers
beyond
its
own
borders
the
power
of
regulating
interstate
commerce
under
the
constitution
belonged
to
congress
interstate
commerce
act
of
within
a
few
years
the
movement
which
had
been
so
effective
in
western
legislatures
appeared
at
washington
in
the
form
of
demands
for
the
federal
regulation
of
interstate
rates
in
the
pressure
became
so
strong
that
congress
created
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
forbade
many
abuses
on
the
part
of
railways
such
as
discriminating
in
charges
between
one
shipper
and
another
and
granting
secret
rebates
to
favored
persons
this
law
was
a
significant
beginning
but
it
left
the
main
question
of
untouched
much
to
the
discontent
of
farmers
and
shippers
sherman
law
of
as
in
the
case
of
the
railways
attacks
upon
the
trusts
were
first
made
in
state
legislatures
where
it
became
the
fashion
to
provide
severe
penalties
for
those
who
formed
monopolies
and
conspired
to
enhance
prices
republicans
and
democrats
united
in
the
promotion
of
measures
of
this
kind
as
in
the
case
of
the
railways
also
the
movement
to
curb
the
trusts
soon
had
spokesmen
at
washington
though
blaine
had
declared
that
trusts
were
largely
a
private
affair
with
which
neither
the
president
nor
any
private
citizen
had
any
particular
right
to
interfere
it
was
a
republican
congress
that
enacted
in
the
first
measure
the
sherman
law
directed
against
great
combinations
in
business
this
act
declared
illegal
every
contract
combination
in
the
form
of
trust
or
otherwise
or
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
and
commerce
among
the
several
states
or
with
foreign
nations
futility
of
the
whether
the
sherman
law
was
directed
against
all
combinations
or
merely
those
which
placed
an
unreasonable
restraint
on
trade
and
competition
was
not
apparent
senator
platt
of
connecticut
a
careful
statesman
of
the
old
school
averred
the
questions
of
whether
the
bill
would
be
operative
of
how
it
would
operate
or
whether
it
was
within
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
it
have
been
whistled
down
the
wind
in
this
senate
as
idle
talk
and
the
whole
effort
has
been
to
get
some
bill
headed
bill
to
punish
trusts
with
which
to
go
to
the
country
whatever
its
purpose
its
effect
upon
existing
trusts
and
upon
the
formation
of
new
combinations
was
negligible
it
was
practically
unenforced
by
president
harrison
and
president
cleveland
in
spite
of
the
constant
demand
for
harsh
action
against
monopolies
it
was
patent
that
neither
the
republicans
nor
the
democrats
were
prepared
for
a
war
on
the
trusts
to
the
bitter
end
the
minor
parties
and

of
dissenting
from
the
election

when
horace
greeley
made
his
excursion
into
politics
onward
there
appeared
in
each
presidential
campaign
one
and
sometimes
two
or
more
parties
stressing
issues
that
appealed
mainly
to
and
farmers
whether
they
chose
to
call
themselves
labor
reformers
greenbackers
or
their
slogans
and
their
platforms
all
pointed
in
one
direction
even
the
prohibitionists
who
in
started
on
their
career
with
a
single
issue
the
abolition
of
the
liquor
traffic
found
themselves
making
declarations
of
faith
on
other
matters
and
hopelessly
split
over
the
money
question
in
a
composite
view
of
the
platforms
put
forth
by
the
dissenting
parties
from
the
administration
of

to
the
close
of
cleveland
second

certain
notions
common
to

all
these
included
among
many
others

regulation
of
the

of

the

so
corruptly
and
unjustly
usurped
popular

of

senators
woman
suffrage
and
a
graduated

tax
placing
the
burden
of
government
on
those
who
can
best
afford
to
pay
instead
of
laying
it
on
the
farmers
and
producers
of
the
old
to
this
long
program
of
measures
the
reformers
added
harsh
and
acrid
criticism
of
the
old
parties
and
sometimes
it
must
be
said
of
established
institutions
of
government
we
denounce
exclaimed
the
labor
party
in
the
democratic
and
republican
parties
as
hopelessly
and
shamelessly
corrupt
and
by
reason
of
their
affiliation
with
monopolies
equally
unworthy
of
the
suffrages
of
those
who
do
not
live
upon
public
plunder
the
united
states
senate
insisted
the
greenbackers
is
a
body
composed
largely
of
aristocratic
millionaires
who
according
to
their
own
party
papers
generally
purchased
their
elections
in
order
to
protect
the
great
monopolies
which
they
represent
indeed
if
their
platforms
are
to
be
accepted
at
face
value
the
greenbackers
believed
that
the
entire
government
had
passed
out
of
the
hands
of
the
people
this
unsparing
not
to
say
revolutionary
criticism
of
american
political
life
appealed
it
seems
mainly
to
farmers
in
the
middle
west
always
active
in
politics
they
had
before
the
civil
war
cast
their
lot
as
a
rule
with
one
or
the
other
of
the
leading
parties
in
however
there
grew
up
among
them
an
association
known
as
the
patrons
of
husbandry
which
was
destined
to
play
a
large
rôle
in
the
partisan
contests
of
the
succeeding
decades
this
society
which
organized
local
lodges
or
granges
on
principles
of
secrecy
and
fraternity
was
originally
designed
to
promote
in
a
general
way
the
interests
of
the
farmers
its
political
bearings
were
apparently
not
grasped
at
first
by
its
promoters
yet
appealing
as
it
did
to
the
most
active
and
independent
spirits
among
the
farmers
and
gathering
to
itself
the
strength
that
always
comes
from
organization
it
soon
found
itself
in
the
hands
of
leaders
more
or
less
involved
in
politics
where
a
few
votes
are
marshaled
together
in
a
democracy
there
is
power
greenback
the
first
extensive
activity
of
the
grangers
was
connected
with
the
attack
on
the
railways
in
the
middle
west
which
forced
several
state
legislatures
to
reduce
freight
and
passenger
rates
by
law
at
the
same
time
some
leaders
in
the
movement
no
doubt
emboldened
by
this
success
launched
in
a
new
political
party
popularly
known
as
the
greenbackers
favoring
a
continued
of
the
legal
tenders
the
beginnings
were
disappointing
but
two
years
later
in
the
congressional
elections
the
greenbackers
swept
whole
sections
of
the
country
their
candidates
polled
more
than
a
million
votes
and
fourteen
of
them
were
returned
to
the
house
of
representatives
to
all
outward
signs
a
new
and
formidable
party
had
entered
the
lists
the
sanguine
hopes
of
the
leaders
proved
to
be
illusory
the
quiet
operations
of
the
resumption
act
the
following
year
a
revival
of
industry
from
a
severe
panic
which
had
set
in
during
the
silver
purchase
act
and
the
of
greenbacks
cut
away
some
of
the
grounds
of
agitation
there
was
also
a
diversion
of
forces
to
the
silver
faction
which
had
a
substantial
support
in
the
silver
mine
owners
of
the
west
at
all
events
the
greenback
vote
fell
to
about
in
the
election
of
a
still
greater
drop
came
four
years
later
and
the
party
gave
up
the
ghost
its
sponsors
returning
to
their
former
allegiance
or
sulking
in
their
tents
rise
of
the
populist
those
leaders
of
the
old
parties
who
now
looked
for
a
happy
future
unvexed
by
new
factions
were
doomed
to
disappointment
the
funeral
of
the
greenback
party
was
hardly
over
before
there
arose
two
other
political
specters
in
the
agrarian
sections
the
national
farmers
alliance
and
industrial
union
particularly
strong
in
the
south
and
west
and
the
farmers
alliance
operating
in
the
north
by
the
two
orders
claimed
over
three
million
members
as
in
the
case
of
the
grangers
many
years
before
the
leaders
among
them

an
easy
way
into
politics

they
held
a
convention
nominated
a
candidate
for
president
and
adopted
the
name
of
people
party
from
which
they
were
known
as
populists
their
platform
in
every
line
breathed
a
spirit
of
radicalism

are
boldly
stolen
to
build
up
colossal
fortunes
for
a
few
having
delivered
this
sweeping
indictment
the
populists
put
forward
their
remedies
the
free

of

a
graduated

postal
savings
banks
and

at
the

approved
the

condemned
the
use
of
federal
troops
in
labor
disputes
on

platform

the
four
years
intervening
between

was
widely
known
as
a
bimetallist

with
difficulty
persuaded
to
accept
the
unequivocal
indorsement
of
the
gold
standard
which
was
pressed
upon
him
by
his
counselors

accepted
it
however
he
proved
to
be
a
valiant
champion
though
his
major
interest
was
undoubtedly
in

him

shall
not
press
upon
the
brow
of
labor
this
crown
of
thorns
you
shall
not
crucify
mankind
upon
a
cross
of
gold
in
all
the
history
of
national
conventions
never
had
an
orator
so
completely
swayed
a
multitude
not
even
yancey
in
his
memorable
plea
in
the
charleston
convention
of
when
with
grave
and
moving
eloquence
he
espoused
the
southern
cause
against
the
impending
fates
the
delegates
after
cheering
bryan
until
they
could
cheer
no
more
tore
the
standards
from
the
floor
and
gathered
around
the
nebraska
delegation
to
renew
the
deafening
applause
the
platform
as
reported
was
carried
by
a
vote
of
two
to
one
and
the
young
orator
from
the
west
hailed
as
america
tiberius
gracchus
was
nominated
as
the
democratic
candidate
for
president
the
south
and
west
had
triumphed
over
the
east
the
division
was
sectional
admittedly
sectional
the
old
combination
of
power
which
calhoun
had
so
anxiously
labored
to
build
up
a
century
earlier
the
gold
democrats
were
repudiated
in
terms
which
were
clear
to
all
a
few
unable
to
endure
the
thought
of
voting
the
republican
ticket
held
a
convention
at
indianapolis
where
with
the
sanction
of
cleveland
they
nominated
candidates
of
their
own
and
endorsed
the
gold
standard
in
a
forlorn
hope
democratic
it
was
to
the
call
from
chicago
that
the
democrats
gave
heed
and
the
republicans
made
answer
the
platform
on
which
bryan
stood
unlike
most
party
manifestoes
was
explicit
in
its
language
and
its
appeal
it
denounced
the
practice
of
allowing
national
banks
to
issue
notes
intended
to
circulate
as
money
on
the
ground
that
it
was
in
derogation
of
the
constitution
recalling
jackson
famous
attack
on
the
bank
in
it
declared
that
tariff
duties
should
be
laid
for
the
purpose
of
revenue
calhoun
doctrine
in
demanding
the
free
coinage
of
silver
it
recurred
to
the
practice
abandoned
in
the
income
tax
came
next
on
the
program
the
platform
alleged
that
the
law
of
passed
by
a
democratic
congress
was
in
strict
pursuance
of
the
uniform
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
and
then
hinted
that
the
decision
annulling
the
law
might
be
reversed
by
the
same
body
as
it
may
hereafter
be
constituted
the
appeal
to
labor
voiced
by
bryan
in
his
crown
of
thorns
speech
was
reinforced
in
the
platform
as
labor
creates
the
wealth
of
the
country
ran
one
plank
we
demand
the
passage
of
such
laws
as
may
be
necessary
to
protect
it
in
all
its
rights
referring
to
the
recent
pullman
strike
the
passions
of
which
had
not
yet
died
away
the
platform
denounced
arbitrary
interference
by
federal
authorities
in
local
affairs
as
a
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
a
crime
against
free
institutions
a
special
objection
was
lodged
against
government
by
injunction
as
a
new
and
highly
dangerous
form
of
oppression
by
which
federal
judges
in
contempt
of
the
laws
of
states
and
rights
of
citizens
become
at
once
legislators
judges
and
executioners
the
remedy
advanced
was
a
federal
law
assuring
trial
by
jury
in
all
cases
of
contempt
in
labor
disputes
having
made
this
declaration
of
faith
the
democrats
with
bryan
at
the
head
raised
their
standard
of
battle
heated
the
campaign
which
ensued
outrivaled
in
the
range
of
its
educational
activities
and
the
bitterness
of
its
tone
all
other
political
conflicts
in
american
history
not
excepting
the
fateful
struggle
of
immense
sums
of
money
were
contributed
to
the
funds
of
both
parties
railway
banking
and
other
corporations
gave
generously
to
the
republicans
the
silver
miners
less
lavishly
but
with
the
same
anxiety
supported
the
democrats
the
country
was
flooded
with
pamphlets
posters
and
handbills
every
public
forum
from
the
great
auditoriums
of
the
cities
to
the
red
schoolhouses
on
the
countryside
was
occupied
by
the
opposing
forces
bryan
took
the
stump
himself
visiting
all
parts
of
the
country
in
special
trains
and
addressing
literally
millions
of
people
in
the
open
air
mckinley
chose
the
older
and
more
formal
plan
he
received
delegations
at
his
home
in
canton
and
discussed
the
issues
of
the
campaign
from
his
front
porch
leaving
to
an
army
of
orators
the
task
of
reaching
the
people
in
their
home
towns
parades
processions
and
monster
demonstrations
filled
the
land
with
politics
whole
states
were
polled
in
advance
by
the
republicans
and
the
doubtful
voters
personally
visited
by
men
equipped
with
arguments
and
literature
manufacturers
frightened
at
the
possibility
of
disordered
public
credit
announced
that
they
would
close
their
doors
if
the
democrats
won
the
election
men
were
dismissed
from
public
and
private
places
on
account
of
their
political
views
one
eminent
college
president
being
forced
out
for
advocating
free
silver
the
language
employed
by
impassioned
and
embittered
speakers
on
both
sides
roused
the
public
to
a
state
of
frenzy
once
more
showing
the
lengths
to
which
men
could
go
in
personal
and
political
abuse
republican
the
verdict
of
the
nation
was
decisive
mckinley
received
of
the
electoral
votes
and
popular
votes
as
against
bryan
the
congressional
elections
were
equally
positive
although
on
account
of
the
composition
of
the
senate
the
democrats
and
populists
still
enjoyed
a
power
out
of
proportion
to
their
strength
as
measured
at
the
polls
even
as
it
was
the
republicans
got
full
control
of
both
houses
a
dominion
of
the
entire
government
which
they
were
to
hold
for
fourteen
years
until
the
second
half
of
taft
administration
when
they
lost
possession
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
yoke
of
indecision
was
broken
the
party
of
sound
finance
and
protective
tariffs
set
out
upon
its
lease
of
power
with
untroubled
assurance
republican
measures
and
results
gold
standard
and
the
yet
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
republicans
did
not
at
once
enact
legislation
making
the
gold
dollar
the
standard
for
the
national
currency
not
until
did
they
take
that
positive
step
in
his
first
inaugural
president
mckinley
as
if
still
uncertain
in
his
own
mind
or
fearing
a
revival
of
the
contest
just
closed
placed
the
tariff
not
the
money
question
in
the
forefront
the
people
have
decided
he
said
that
such
legislation
should
be
had
as
will
give
ample
protection
and
encouragement
to
the
industries
and
development
of
our
country
protection
for
american
industries
therefore
he
urged
is
the
task
before
congress
with
adequate
revenue
secured
but
not
until
then
we
can
enter
upon
changes
in
our
fiscal
laws
as
the
republicans
had
only
of
the
ninety
senators
and
at
least
four
of
them
were
known
advocates
of
free
silver
the
discretion
exercised
by
the
president
in
selecting
the
tariff
for
congressional
debate
was
the
better
part
of
valor
congress
gave
heed
to
the
warning
under
the
direction
of
nelson
dingley
whose
name
was
given
to
the
bill
a
tariff
measure
levying
the
highest
rates
yet
laid
in
the
history
of
american
imposts
was
prepared
and
driven
through
the
house
of
representatives
the
opposition
encountered
in
the
senate
especially
from
the
west
was
overcome
by
concessions
in
favor
of
that
section
but
the
duties
on
sugar
tin
steel
lumber
hemp
and
in
fact
all
of
the
essential
commodities
handled
by
combinations
and
trusts
were
materially
raised
illustration
by
underwood
and
underwood
president
mckinley
and
his
cabinet
of
the
years
that
followed
the
enactment
of
the
dingley
law
were
whatever
the
cause
the
most
prosperous
the
country
had
witnessed
for
many
a
decade
industries
of
every
kind
were
soon
running
full
blast
labor
was
employed
commerce
spread
more
swiftly
than
ever
to
the
markets
of
the
world
coincident
with
this
progress
was
the
organization
of
the
greatest
combinations
and
trusts
the
world
had
yet
seen
in
the
smelters
formed
a
trust
with
a
capital
of
in
the
same
year
the
standard
oil
company
with
a
capital
of
over
one
hundred
millions
took
the
place
of
the
old
trust
and
the
copper
trust
was
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
new
jersey
its
par
value
capital
being
fixed
shortly
afterward
at
a
year
later
the
national
sugar
refining
company
of
new
jersey
started
with
a
capital
of
adopting
the
policy
of
issuing
to
the
stockholders
no
public
statement
of
its
earnings
or
financial
condition
before
another
twelvemonth
had
elapsed
all
previous
corporate
financing
was
reduced
to
small
proportions
by
the
flotation
of
the
united
states
steel
corporation
with
a
capital
of
more
than
a
billion
dollars
an
enterprise
set
in
motion
by
the
famous
morgan
banking
house
of
new
york
in
nearly
all
these
gigantic
undertakings
the
same
great
leaders
in
finance
were
more
or
less
intimately
associated
to
use
the
language
of
an
eminent
authority
they
are
all
allied
and
intertwined
by
their
various
mutual
interests
for
instance
the
pennsylvania
railroad
interests
are
on
the
one
hand
allied
with
the
vanderbilts
and
on
the
other
with
the
rockefellers
the
vanderbilts
are
closely
allied
with
the
morgan
group
viewed
as
a
whole
we
find
the
dominating
influences
in
the
trusts
to
be
made
up
of
a
network
of
large
and
small
capitalists
many
allied
to
one
another
by
ties
of
more
or
less
importance
but
all
being
appendages
to
or
parts
of
the
greater
groups
which
are
themselves
dependent
on
and
allied
with
the
two
mammoth
or
rockefeller
and
morgan
groups
these
two
mammoth
groups
jointly
constitute
the
heart
of
the
business
and
commercial
life
of
the
nation
such
was
the
picture
of
triumphant
business
enterprise
drawn
by
a
financier
within
a
few
years
after
the
memorable
campaign
of
america
had

energetic
leaders
in

america
a
world
power
it
has
now
become
a
fashion
sanctioned
by
wide
usage
and
by
eminent
historians
to
speak
of
america
triumphant
over
spain
and
possessed
of
new
colonies
as
entering
the
twentieth
century
in
the
rôle
of
a
world
power
for
the
first
time
perhaps
at
this
late
day
it
is
useless
to
protest
against
the
currency
of
the
idea
nevertheless
the
truth
is
that
from
the
fateful
moment
in
march
when
edmund
burke
unfolded
to
his
colleagues
in
the
british
parliament
the
resources
of
an
invincible
america
down
to
the
settlement
at
versailles
in
closing
the
drama
of
the
world
war
this
nation
has
been
a
world
power
influencing
by
its
example
by
its
institutions
by
its
wealth
trade
and
arms
the
course
of
international
affairs
and
it
should
be
said
also
that
neither
in
the
field
of
commercial
enterprise
nor
in
that
of
diplomacy
has
it
been
wanting
in
spirit
or
ingenuity
when
john
hay
secretary
of
state
heard
that
an
american
citizen
perdicaris
had
been
seized
by
raisuli
a
moroccan
bandit
in
he
wired
his
brusque
message
we
want
perdicaris
alive
or
raisuli
dead
this
was
but
an
echo
of
commodore
decatur
equally
characteristic
answer
not
a
minute
given
nearly
a
hundred
years
before
to
the
pirates
of
algiers
begging
for
time
to
consider
whether
they
would
cease
preying
upon
american
merchantmen
was
it
not
as
early
as
that
the
american
commissioner
caleb
cushing
taking
advantage
of
the
british
opium
war
on
china
negotiated
with
the
celestial
empire
a
successful
commercial
treaty
did
he
not
then
exultantly
exclaim
the
laws
of
the
union
follow
its
citizens
and
its
banner
protects
them
even
within
the
domain
of
the
chinese
empire
was
it
not
almost
half
a
century
before
the
battle
of
manila
bay
in
that
commodore
perry
with
an
adequate
naval
force
gently
coerced
japan
into
friendship
with
us
leading
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
in
the
opening
of
that
empire
to
the
trade
of
the
occident
nor
is
it
inappropriate
in
this
connection
to
recall
the
fact
that
the
monroe
doctrine
celebrates
in
its
hundredth
anniversary
american
foreign
relations
intrigues
in
mexico
between
the
war
for
the
union
and
the
war
with
spain
the
department
of
state
had
many
an
occasion
to
present
the
rights
of
america
among
the
powers
of
the
world
only
a
little
while
after
the
civil
conflict
came
to
a
close
it
was
called
upon
to
deal
with
a
dangerous
situation
created
in
mexico
by
the
ambitions
of
napoleon
iii
during
the
administration
of
buchanan
mexico
had
fallen
into
disorder
through
the
strife
of
the
liberal
and
the
clerical
parties
the
president
asked
for
authority
to
use
american
troops
to
bring
to
a
peaceful
haven
a
wreck
upon
the
ocean
drifting
about
as
she
is
impelled
by
different
factions
our
own
domestic
crisis
then
intervened
observing
the
united
states
heavily
involved
in
its
own
problems
the
great
powers
england
france
and
spain
decided
in
the
autumn
of
to
take
a
hand
themselves
in
restoring
order
in
mexico
they
entered
into
an
agreement
to
enforce
the
claims
of
their
citizens
against
mexico
and
to
protect
their
subjects
residing
in
that
republic
they
invited
the
united
states
to
join
them
and
on
meeting
a
polite
refusal
they
prepared
for
a
combined
military
and
naval
demonstration
on
their
own
account
in
the
midst
of
this
action
england
and
spain
discovering
the
sinister
purposes
of
napoleon
withdrew
their
troops
and
left
the
field
to
him
the
french
emperor
it
was
well
known
looked
with
jealousy
upon
the
growth
of
the
united
states
and
dreamed
of
establishing
in
the
western
hemisphere
an
imperial
power
to
offset
the
american
republic
intervention
to
collect
debts
was
only
a
cloak
for
his
deeper
designs
throwing
off
that
guise
in
due
time
he
made
the
archduke
maximilian
a
brother
of
the
ruler
of
austria
emperor
in
mexico
and
surrounded
his
throne
by
french
soldiers
in
spite
of
all
protests
this
insolent
attack
upon
the
mexican
republic
deeply
resented
in
the
united
states
was
allowed
to
drift
in
its
course
until
at
that
juncture
general
sheridan
was
dispatched
to
the
mexican

was
busy
with
negotiations
which
resulted
in
the
purchase
of

from

six

larger

turned
to
the
increase

was
defeated
on
this
occasion
by
the
refusal
of
the
senate
to
ratify
the

it
was
not
yet
prepared
to
exercise

undaunted
by

policies
president

warmly
advocated
the

of

this
little
republic

long
been
in

state

by
the

his
effort
he
continued
to
urge
the
subject
of
annexation
even
in
his
last
message
to
congress
he
referred
to
it
saying
that
time
had
only
proved
the
wisdom
of
his
early
course
the
addition
of
santo
domingo
to
the
american
sphere
of
protection
was
the
work
of
a
later
generation
the
state
department
temporarily
checked

to
bide
its
time
claims
indeed
it
had
in
hand
a
far
more
serious
matter
a
vexing
issue
that
grew
out
of
civil
war
diplomacy
the
british
government
as
already
pointed
out
in
other
connections
had
permitted
confederate
cruisers
including
the
famous
built
in
british
ports
to
escape
and
prey
upon
the
commerce
of
the
northern
states
this
action
denounced
at
the
time
by
our
government
as
a
grave
breach
of
neutrality
as
well
as
a
grievous
injury
to
american
citizens
led
first
to
remonstrances
and
finally
to
repeated
claims
for
damages
done
to
american
ships
and
goods
for
a
long
time
great
britain
was
firm
her
foreign
secretary
denied
all
obligations
in
the
premises
adding
somewhat
curtly
that
he
wished
to
say
once
for
all
that
her
majesty
government
disclaimed
any
responsibility
for
the
losses
and
hoped
that
they
had
made
their
position
perfectly
clear
still
president
grant
was
not
persuaded
that
the
door
of
diplomacy
though
closed
was
barred
hamilton
fish
his
secretary
of
state
renewed
the
demand
finally
he
secured
from
the
british
government
in
the
treaty
of
washington
providing
for
the
arbitration
not
merely
of
the
and
other
claims
but
also
all
points
of
serious
controversy
between
the
two
countries
the
tribunal
of
arbitration
thus
authorized
sat
at
geneva
in
switzerland
and
after
a
long
and
careful
review
of
the
arguments
on
both
sides
awarded
to
the
united
states
the
lump
sum
of
to
be
distributed
among
the
american
claimants
the
damages
thus
allowed
were
large
unquestionably
larger
than
strict
justice
required
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
decision
excited
much
adverse
comment
in
england
nevertheless
the
prompt
payment
by
the
british
government
swept
away
at
once
a
great
cloud
of
in
america
moreover
the
spectacle
of
two
powerful
nations
choosing
the
way
of
peaceful
arbitration
to
settle
an
angry
dispute
seemed
a
happy
if
illusory
omen
of
a
modern
method
for
avoiding
the
arbitrament
of
war
if
the
senate
had
its
doubts
at
first
about
the
wisdom
of
acquiring
strategic
points
for
naval
power
in
distant
seas
the
same
could
not
be
said
of
the
state
department
or
naval
officers

agreement
providing
among
other
things
for

use
of
the
harbor
of
pago
pago
as
a
naval
base
was
six
years
later
changed
into
a
formal
treaty
ratified
by
the
senate
such
enterprise
could
not
escape
the
vigilant
eyes
of
england
and
germany
both
mindful
of
the
course
of
the
sea
power
in
history
the
german
emperor
seizing
as
a
pretext
a
quarrel
between
his
consul
in
the
islands
and
a
native
king
laid
claim
to
an
interest
in
the
samoan
group
england
aware
of
the
dangers
arising
from
german
outposts
in
the
southern
seas
so
near
to
australia
was
not
content
to
stand
aside
so
it
happened
that
all
three
countries
sent
battleships
to
the
samoan
waters
threatening
a
crisis
that
was
fortunately
averted
by
friendly
settlement
if
as
is
alleged
germany
entertained
a
notion
of
challenging
american
sea
power
then
and
there
the
presence
of
british
ships
must
have
dispelled
that
dream
the
result
of
the
affair
was
a
tripartite
agreement
by
which
the
three
powers
in
undertook
a
protectorate
over
the
islands
but
joint
control
proved
unsatisfactory
there
was
constant
friction
between
the
germans
and
the
english
the
spheres
of
authority
being
vague
and
open
to
dispute
the
plan
had
to
be
abandoned
at
the
end
of
ten
years
england
withdrew
altogether
leaving
to
germany
all
the
islands
except
tutuila
which
was
ceded
outright
to
the
united
states
thus
one
of
the
finest
harbors
in
the
pacific
to
the
intense
delight
of
the
american
navy
passed
permanently
under
american
dominion
another
triumph
in
diplomacy
was
set
down
to
the
credit
of
the
state
department
and
the
venezuela
in
the
relations
with
south
america
as
well
as
in
those
with
the
distant
pacific
the
diplomacy
of
the
government
at
washington
was
put
to
the
test
for
some
time
it
had
been
watching
a
dispute
between
england
and
venezuela
over
the
western
boundary
of
british
guiana
and
on
an
appeal
from
venezuela
it
had
taken
a
lively
interest
in
the
contest
in
president
cleveland
saw
that
great
britain
would
yield
none
of
her
claims
after
hearing
the
arguments
of
venezuela
his
secretary
of
state
richard
olney
in
a
note
none
too
conciliatory
asked
the
british
government
whether
it
was
willing
to
arbitrate
the
points
in
controversy
this
inquiry
he
accompanied
by
a
warning
to
the
effect
that
the
united
states
could
not
permit
any
european
power
to
contest
its
mastery
in
this
hemisphere
the
united
states
said
the
secretary
is
practically
sovereign
on
this
continent
and
its
fiat
is
law
upon
the
subjects
to
which
it
confines
its
interposition
its
infinite
resources
combined
with
its
isolated
position
render
it
master
of
the
situation
and
practically
invulnerable
against
any
or
all
other
powers
the
reply
evoked
from
the
british
government
by
this
strong
statement
was
firm
and
clear
the
monroe
doctrine
it
said
even
if
not
so
widely
stretched
by
interpretation
was
not
binding
in
international
law
the
dispute
with
venezuela
was
a
matter
of
interest
merely
to
the
parties
involved
and
arbitration
of
the
question
was
impossible
this
response
called
forth
president
cleveland
startling
message
of
he
asked
congress
to
create
a
commission
authorized
to
ascertain
by
researches
the
true
boundary
between
venezuela
and
british
guiana
he
added
that
it
would
be
the
duty
of
this
country
to
resist
by
every
means
in
its
power
as
a
willful
aggression
upon
its
rights
and
interests
the
appropriation
by
great
britain
of
any
lands
or
the
exercise
of
governmental
jurisdiction
over
any
territory
which
after
investigation
we
have
determined
of
right
belongs
to
venezuela
the
serious
character
of
this
statement
he
thoroughly
understood
he
declared
that
he
was
conscious
of
his
responsibilities
intimating
that
war
much
as
it
was
to
be
deplored
was
not
comparable
to
a
supine
submission
to
wrong
and
injustice
and
the
consequent
loss
of
national
and
honor
illustration
grover
cleveland
the
note
of
defiance
which
ran
through
this
message
greeted
by
shrill
cries
of
enthusiasm
in
many
circles
was
viewed
in
other
quarters
as
a
portent
of
war
responsible
newspapers
in
both
countries
spoke
of
an
armed
settlement
of
the
dispute
as
inevitable
congress
created
the
commission
and
appropriated
money
for
the
investigation
a
body
of
learned
men
was
appointed
to
determine
the
merits
of
the
conflicting
boundary
claims
the
british
government
deaf
to
the
clamor
of
the
bellicose
section
of
the
london
press
deplored
the
incident
courteously
replied
in
the
affirmative
to
a
request
for
assistance
in
the
search
for
evidence
and
finally
agreed
to
the
proposition
that
the
issue
be
submitted
to
arbitration
the
outcome
of
this
somewhat
perilous
dispute
contributed
not
a
little
to
cleveland
reputation
as
a
sterling
representative
of
the
true
american
spirit
this
was
not
diminished
when
the
tribunal
of
arbitration
found
that
great
britain
was
on
the
whole
right
in
her
territorial
claims
against
venezuela
annexation
of
while
engaged
in
the
dangerous
venezuela
controversy
president
cleveland
was
compelled
by
a
strange
turn
in
events
to
consider
the
annexation
of
the
hawaiian
islands
in
the
for
more
than
half
a
century
american
missionaries
had
been
active
in
converting
the
natives
to
the
christian
faith
and
enterprising
american
business
men
had
been
developing
the
fertile
sugar
plantations
both
the
department
of
state
and
the
navy
department
were
fully
conscious
of
the
strategic
relation
of
the
islands
to
the
growth
of
sea
power
and
watched
with
anxiety
any
developments
likely
to
bring
them
under
some
other
dominion
the
country
at
large
was
indifferent
however
until
when
a
revolution
headed
by
americans
broke
out
ending
in
the
overthrow
of
the
native
government
the
abolition
of
the
primitive
monarchy
and
the
retirement
of
queen
liliuokalani
to
private
life
this
crisis
a
repetition
of
the
texas
affair
in
a
small
theater
was
immediately
followed
by
a
demand
from
the
new
hawaiian
government
for
annexation
to
the
united
states
president
harrison
looked
with
favor
on
the
proposal
negotiated
the
treaty
of
annexation
and
laid
it
before
the
senate
for
approval
there
it
still
rested
when
his
term
of
office
was
brought
to
a
close
harrison
successor
cleveland
it
was
well
known
had
doubts
about
the
propriety
of
american
action
in
hawaii
for
the
purpose
of
making
an
inquiry
into
the
matter
he
sent
a
special
commissioner
to
the
islands
on
the
basis
of
the
report
of
his
agent
cleveland
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
revolution
in
the
island
kingdom
had
been
accomplished
by
the
improper
use
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
wrong
should
be
righted
by
a
restoration
of
the
queen
to
her
throne
such
being
his
matured
conviction
though
the
facts
upon
which
he
rested
it
were
warmly
controverted
he
could
do
nothing
but
withdraw
the
treaty
from
the
senate
and
close
the
incident
to
the
republicans
this
sharp
and
cavalier
disposal
of
their
plans
carried
out
in
a
way
that
impugned
the
motives
of
a
republican
president
was
nothing
less
than
a
betrayal
of
american
interests
in
their
platform
of
they
made
clear
their
position
our
foreign
policy
should
be
at
all
times
firm
vigorous
and
dignified
and
all
our
interests
in
the
western
hemisphere
carefully
watched

the
hawaiian
islands

be
controlled
by
the
united
states

no
foreign
power
should
be
permitted
to
interfere
with
them
there
was
no
mistaking
this
view
of
the
issue
as
the
vote
in
the
election
gave
popular
sanction
to
republican
policies
congress
by
a
joint
resolution

a
century

kept
an
anxious
eye
upon
this
base

power

full
well

this
proposal
squarely
rejected
furnished
the
occasion
for
a
statement
of
american
policy
which
stood
the
test
of
all
the
years
that
followed

that
the
affair
was
one
between

cleveland
chose

he

anxious

a
tender
rejected
by

with

broad

that

might
be

in
putting
a
stop
to
the
unlawful

in

and

afforded

thereupon
the
president
returned
to
the
course
he
had
marked
out
for
himself
leaving
the
public
nuisance
to
his
successor
president
mckinley
the
republicans
in
found
themselves
in
a
position
to
employ
that
firm
vigorous
and
dignified
foreign
policy
which
they
had
approved
in
their
platform
they
had
declared
the
government
of
spain
having
lost
control
of
cuba
and
being
unable
to
protect
the
property
or
lives
of
resident
american
citizens
or
to
comply
with
its
treaty
obligations
we
believe
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
should
actively
use
its
influence
and
good
offices
to
restore
peace
and
give
independence
to
the
island
the
american
property
in
cuba
to
which
the
republicans
referred
in
their
platform
amounted
by
this
time
to
more
than
fifty
million
dollars
the
commerce
with
the
island
reached
more
than
one
hundred
millions
annually
and
the
claims
of
american
citizens
against
spain
for
property
destroyed
totaled
sixteen
millions
to
the
pleas
of
humanity
which
made
such
an
effective
appeal
to
the
hearts
of
the
american
people
there
were
thus
added
practical
considerations
of
great
weight
mckinley
in
the
face
of
the
swelling
tide
of
popular
opinion
in
favor
of
quick
drastic
and
positive
action
mckinley
chose
first
the
way
of
diplomacy
a
short
time
after
his
inauguration
he
lodged
with
the
spanish
government
a
dignified
protest
against
its
policies
in
cuba
thus
opening
a
game
of
thrust
and
parry
with
the
suave
ministers
at
madrid
the
results
of
the
exchange
of
notes
were
the
recall
of
the
obnoxious
general
weyler
the
appointment
of
a
less
bloodthirsty
in
his
methods
a
change
in
the
policy
of
concentrating
civilians
in
military
camps
and
finally
a
promise
of
home
rule
for
cuba
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
spanish
government
was
eager
to
avoid
a
war
that
could
have
but
one
outcome
the
american
minister
at
madrid
general
woodford
was
convinced
that
firm
and
patient
pressure
would
have
resulted
in
the
final
surrender
of
cuba
by
the
spanish
government
de
lome
and
the
such
a
policy
was
defeated
by
events
in
february
a
private
letter
written
by
señor
de
lome
the
spanish
ambassador
at
washington
expressing
contempt
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
filched
from
the
mails
and
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
journalist
william
hearst
who
published
it
to
the
world
in
the
excited
state
of
american
opinion
few
gave
heed
to
the
grave
breach
of
diplomatic
courtesy
committed
by
breaking
open
private
correspondence
the
spanish
government
was
compelled
to
recall
de
lome
thus
officially
condemning
his
conduct
at
this
point
a
far
more
serious
crisis
put
the
pacific
relations
of
the
two
negotiating
countries
in
dire
peril
on
february
the
battleship
riding
in
the
harbor
of
havana
was
blown
up
and
sunk
carrying
to
death
two
officers
and
two
hundred
and
members
of
the
crew
this
tragedy
ascribed
by
the
american
public
to
the
malevolence
of
spanish
officials
profoundly
stirred
an
already
furious
nation
when
on
march
a
commission
of
inquiry
reported
that
the
ship
had
been
blown
up
by
a
submarine
mine
which
had
in
turn
set
off
some
of
the
ship
magazines
the
worst
suspicions
seemed
confirmed
if
any
one
was
inclined
to
be
indifferent
to
the
cuban
war
for
independence
he
was
now
met
by
the
vehement
cry
remember
the
still
the
state
department
under
steady
hand
pursued
the
path
of
negotiation
spain
proving
more
pliable
and
more
ready
with
promises
of
reform
in
the
island
early
in
april
however
there
came
a
decided
change
in
the
tenor
of
american
diplomacy
on
the
mckinley
evidently
convinced
that
promises
did
not
mean
performances
instructed
our
minister
at
madrid
to
warn
the
spanish
government
that
as
no
effective
armistice
had
been
offered
to
the
cubans
he
would
lay
the
whole
matter
before
congress
this
decision
every
one
knew
from
the
temper
of
congress
meant
war
a
prospect
which
excited
all
the
european
powers
the
pope
took
an
active
interest
in
the
crisis
france
and
germany
foreseeing
from
long
experience
in
world
politics
an
increase
of
american
power
and
prestige
through
war
sought
to
prevent
it
spain
hopeless
and
conscious
of
her
weakness
at
last
dispatched
to
the
president
a
note
promising
to
suspend
hostilities
to
call
a
cuban
parliament
and
to
grant
all
the
autonomy
that
could
be
reasonably
asked
mckinley
calls
for
for
reasons
of
his
own
reasons
which
have
never
yet
been
fully
explained
mckinley
ignored
the
final
program
of
concessions
presented
by
spain
at
the
very
moment
when
his
patient
negotiations
seemed
to
bear
full
fruit
he
veered
sharply
from
his
course
and
launched
the
country
into
the
war
by
sending
to
congress
his
militant
message
of
april
without
making
public
the
last
note
he
had
received
from
spain
he
declared
that
he
was
brought
to
the
end
of
his
effort
and
the
cause
was
in
the
hands
of
congress
humanity
the
protection
of
american
citizens
and
property
the
injuries
to
american
commerce
and
business
the
inability
of
spain
to
bring
about
permanent
peace
in
the
island
these
were
the
grounds
for
action
that
induced
him
to
ask
for
authority
to
employ
military
and
naval
forces
in
establishing
a
stable
government
in
cuba
they
were
sufficient
for
a
public
already
straining
at
the
leash
resolution
of
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
outcome
when
the
issue
was
withdrawn
from
diplomacy
and
placed
in
charge
of
congress
resolutions
were
soon
introduced
into
the
house
of
representatives
authorizing
the
president
to
employ
armed
force
in
securing
peace
and
order
in
the
island
and
establishing
by
the
free
action
of
the
people
thereof
a
stable
and
independent
government
of
their
own
to
the
form
and
spirit
of
this
proposal
the
democrats
and
populists
took
exception
in
the
senate
where
they
were
stronger
their
position
had
to
be
reckoned
with
by
the
narrow
republican
majority
as
the
resolution
finally
read
the
independence
of
cuba
was
recognized
spain
was
called
upon
to
relinquish
her
authority
and
withdraw
from
the
island
and
the
president
was
empowered
to
use
force
to
the
extent
necessary
to
carry
the
resolutions
into
effect
furthermore
the
united
states
disclaimed
any
disposition
or
intention
to
exercise
sovereignty
jurisdiction
or
control
over
said
island
except
for
the
pacification
thereof
final
action
was
taken
by
congress
on
april
and
approved
by
the
president
on
the
following
day
and
startling
events
then
followed
in
swift
succession

through

the

approached

for

commissioners
of

two
countries
met
at
paris
to
bring
about
the
final
settlement
when
the
day
for
the
first
session
of
the
conference
arrived
the
government
at
washington
apparently
had
not
made
up
its
mind
on
the
final
disposition
of
the
philippines
perhaps
before
the
battle
of
manila
bay
not
ten
thousand
people
in
the
united
states
knew
or
cared
where
the
philippines
were
certainly
there
was
in
the
autumn
of
no
decided
opinion
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
the
fruits
of
dewey
victory
president
mckinley
doubtless
voiced
the
sentiment
of
the
people
when
he
stated
to
the
peace
commissioners
on
the
eve
of
their
departure
that
there
had
originally
been
no
thought
of
conquest
in
the
pacific
the
march
of
events
he
added
had
imposed
new
duties
on
the
country
incidental
to
our
tenure
in
the
philippines
he
said
is
the
commercial
opportunity
to
which
american
statesmanship
can
not
be
indifferent
it
is
just
to
use
every
legitimate
means
for
the
enlargement
of
american
trade
on
this
ground
he
directed
the
commissioners
to
accept
not
less
than
the
cession
of
the
island
of
luzon
the
chief
of
the
philippine
group
with
its
harbor
of
manila
it
was
not
until
the
latter
part
of
october
that
he
definitely
instructed
them
to
demand
the
entire
archipelago
on
the
theory
that
the
occupation
of
luzon
alone
could
not
be
justified
on
political
commercial
or
humanitarian
grounds
this
departure
from
the
letter
of
the
peace
protocol
was
bitterly
resented
by
the
spanish
agents
it
was
with
heaviness
of
heart
that
they
surrendered
the
last
sign
of
ancient
dominion
in
the
far
pacific
final
terms
of
the
treaty
of
peace
as
finally
agreed
upon
embraced
the
following
terms
the
independence
of
cuba
the
cession
of
porto
rico
guam
and
the
philippines
to
the
united
states
the
settlement
of
claims
filed
by
the
citizens
of
both
countries
the
payment
of
twenty
million
dollars
to
spain
by
the
united
states
for
the
philippines
and
the
determination
of
the
status
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
ceded
territories
by
congress
the
great
decision
had
been
made
its
issue
was
in
the
hands
of
the
senate

the
democrats
and
the
populists
held
the
balance
of
power
under
the
requirement
of

in
america
over
the

of
the

of

directed
the
shifting
tides
of
public
opinion
into
two
distinct
channels
support
of
the
policy
and
opposition
to
it
the
trend
in
republican
leadership
long
in
the
direction
marked
out
by
the
treaty
now
came
into
the
open
perhaps
a
majority
of
the
men
highest
in
the
councils
of
that
party
had
undergone
the
change
of
heart
reflected
in
the
letters
of
john
hay
secretary
of
state
in
august
of
he
had
hinted
in
a
friendly
letter
to
andrew
carnegie
that
he
sympathized
with
the
latter
opposition
to
imperialism
but
he
had
added
quickly
the
only
question
in
my
mind
is
how
far
it
is
now
possible
for
us
to
withdraw
from
the
philippines
in
november
of
the
same
year
he
wrote
to
whitelaw
reid
one
of
the
peace
commissioners
at
paris
there
is
a
wild
and
frantic
attack
now
going
on
in
the
press
against
the
whole
philippine
transaction
andrew
carnegie
really
seems
to
be
off
his
head
but
all
this
confusion
of
tongues
will
go
its
way
the
country
will
applaud
the
resolution
that
has
been
reached
and
you
will
return
in
the
rôle
of
conquering
heroes
with
your
bound
with
oak
senator
beveridge
of
indiana
and
senator
platt
of
connecticut
accepting
the
verdict
of
history
as
the
proof
of
manifest
destiny
called
for
unquestioning
support
of
the
administration
in
its
final
step
every
expansion
of
our
territory
said
the
latter
has
been
in
accordance
with
the
irresistible
law
of
growth
we
could
no
more
resist
the
successive
expansions
by
which
we
have
grown
to
be
the
strongest
nation
on
earth
than
a
tree
can
resist
its
growth
the
history
of
territorial
expansion
is
the
history
of
our
nation
progress
and
glory
it
is
a
matter
to
be
proud
of
not
to
lament
we
should
rejoice
that
providence
has
given
us
the
opportunity
to
extend
our
influence
our
institutions
and
our
civilization
into
regions
hitherto
closed
to
us
rather
than
contrive
how
we
can
thwart
its
designs
this
doctrine
was
savagely
attacked
by
opponents
of
mckinley
policy
many
a
stanch
republican

with
the
majority
of
democrats
in
denouncing
the
treaty
as
a

eager

shall
not

joseph
chamberlain
the
distinguished
liberal
statesman
thinking
no
doubt
of
the
continental
situation
said
in
a
political
address
at
the
very
opening
of
the
war
that
the
next
duty
of
englishmen
is
to
establish
and
maintain
bonds
of
permanent
unity
with
our
kinsmen
across
the
atlantic
i
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
terrible
as
war
may
be
even
war
would
be
cheaply
purchased
if
in
a
great
and
noble
cause
the
stars
and
stripes
and
the
union
jack
should
wave
together
over
an
alliance
to
the
american
ambassador
he
added
significantly
that
he
did
not
care
a
hang
what
they
say
about
it
on
the
continent
which
was
another
way
of
expressing
the
hope
that
the
warning
to
germany
and
france
was
sufficient
this
friendly
english
opinion
so
useful
to
the
united
states
when
a
combination
of
powers
to
support
spain
was
more
than
possible
removed
all
fears
as
to
the
consequences
of
the
war
henry
adams
recalling
days
of
humiliation
in
london
during
the
civil
war
when
his
father
was
the
american
ambassador
coolly
remarked
that
it
was
the
sudden
appearance
of
germany
as
the
grizzly
terror
that
frightened
england
into
arms
but
the
net
result
in
keeping
the
field
free
for
an
easy
triumph
of
american
arms
was
none
the
less
appreciated
in
washington
where
despite
outward
calm
fears
of
european
complications
were
never
absent
american
policies
in
the
philippines
and
the
orient
filipino
revolt
against
american
in
the
sphere
of
domestic
politics
as
well
as
in
the
field
of
foreign
relations
the
outcome
of
the
spanish
war
exercised
a
marked
influence
it
introduced
at
once
problems
of
colonial
administration
and
difficulties
in
adjusting
trade
relations
with
the
outlying
dominions
these
were
furthermore
complicated
in
the
very
beginning
by
the
outbreak
of
an
insurrection
against
american
sovereignty
in
the
philippines
the
leader
of
the
revolt
aguinaldo
had
been
invited
to
join
the
american
forces
in
overthrowing
spanish
dominion
and
he
had
assumed
apparently
without
warrant
that
independence
would
be
the
result
of
the
joint
operations
when
the
news
reached
him
that
the
american
flag
had
been
substituted
for
the
spanish
flag
his
resentment
was
keen
in
february
there
occurred
a
slight
collision
between
his
men
and
some
american
soldiers
the
conflict
thus
begun
was
followed
by
serious
fighting
which
finally
dwindled
into
a
vexatious
guerrilla
warfare
lasting
three
years
and
costing
heavily
in
men
and
money
atrocities
were
committed
by
the
native
insurrectionists
and
sad
to
relate
they
were
repaid
in
kind
it
was
argued
in
defense
of
the
army
that
the
ordinary
rules
of
warfare
were
without
terror
to
men
accustomed
to
fighting
like
savages
in
vain
did
mckinley
assure
the
filipinos
that
the
institutions
and
laws
established
in
the
islands
would
be
designed
not
for
our
satisfaction
or
for
the
expression
of
our
theoretical
views
but
for
the
happiness
peace
and
prosperity
of
the
people
of
the
philippine
islands
nothing
short
of
military
pressure
could
bring
the
warring
revolutionists
to
terms
on
republican
imperialism
the
filipino
insurrection
following
so
quickly
upon
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
with
spain
moved
the
american
opponents
of
mckinley
colonial
policies
to
redouble
their
denunciation
of
what
they
were
pleased
to
call
imperialism
senator
hoar
was
more
than
usually
caustic
in
his
indictment
of
the
new
course
the
revolt
against
american
rule
did
but
convince
him
of
the
folly
hidden
in
the
first
fateful
measures
everywhere
he
saw
a
conspiracy
of
silence
and
injustice
i
have
failed
to
discover
in
the
speeches
public
or
private
of
the
advocates
of
this
war
he
contended
in
the
senate
or
in
the
press
which
supports
it
and
them
a
single
expression
anywhere
of
a
desire
to
do
justice
to
the
people
of
the
philippine
islands
or
of
a
desire
to
make
known
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
the
truth
of
the
case
the
catchwords
the
cries
the
pithy
and
pregnant
phrases
of
which
their
speech
is
full
all
mean
dominion
they
mean
perpetual
dominion
there
is
not
one
of
these
gentlemen
who
will
rise
in
his
place
and
affirm
that
if
he
were
a
filipino
he
would
not
do
exactly
as
the
filipinos
are
doing
that
he
would
not
despise
them
if
they
were
to
do
otherwise
so
much
at
least
they
owe
of
respect
to
the
dead
and
buried
history
the
dead
and
buried
history
so
far
as
they
can
slay
and
bury
it
of
their
country
in
the
way
of
practical
suggestions
the
senator
offered
as
a
solution
of
the
problem
the
recognition
of
independence
assistance
in
establishing
and
an
invitation
to
all
powers
to
join
in
a
guarantee
of
freedom
to
the
islands
republican

mckinley
and
his
supporters
engaged
in
a
sanguinary
struggle
to
maintain
american
supremacy
such
talk
was
more
than
quixotic
it
was
scarcely
short
of
treasonable
they
pointed
out
the
practical
obstacles
in
the
way
of
uniform
for
a
collection
of
seven
million
people
ranging
in
civilization
from
the
most
ignorant
hill
men
to
the
highly
cultivated
inhabitants
of
manila
the
incidents
of
the
revolt
and
its
repression
they
admitted
were
painful
enough
but
still
nothing
as
compared
with
the
chaos
that
would
follow
the
attempt
of
a
people
who
had
never
had
experience
in
such
matters
to
set
up
and
sustain
democratic
institutions
they
preferred
rather
the
gradual
process
of
fitting
the
inhabitants
of
the
islands
for
this
course
in
their
eyes
though
less
poetic
was
more
in
harmony
with
the
ideals
of
humanity
having
set
out
upon
it
they
pursued
it
steadfastly
to
the
end
first
they
applied
force
without
stint
to
the
suppression
of
the
revolt
then
they
devoted
such
genius
for
colonial
administration
as
they
could
command
to

development

never
was
this
clearer
than

begun

nearly
five

representing

chinese
capital
diplomatic
questions
of
the
most
delicate
character
arose
for
more
than
half
a
century
the
imperial
powers
of
europe
had
been
carving
up
the
chinese
empire
taking
to
themselves
territory
railway
concessions
mining
rights
ports
and
commercial
privileges
at
the
expense
of
the
huge
but
helpless
victim
the
united
states
alone
among
the
great
nations
while
as
zealous
as
any
in
the
pursuit
of
peaceful
trade
had
refrained
from
seizing
chinese
territory
or
ports
moreover
the
department
of
state
had
been
urging
european
countries
to
treat
china
with
fairness
to
respect
her
territorial
integrity
and
to
give
her
equal
trading
privileges
with
all

american
policy
of

open
door
in
the
autumn
of
secretary
hay
had
addressed
to
london
berlin
rome
paris
tokyo
and
petersburg
his
famous
note
on
the
open
door
policy
in
china
in
this
document
he
proposed
that
existing
treaty
ports
and
vested
interests
of
the
several
foreign
countries
should
be
respected
that
the
chinese
government
should
be
permitted
to
extend
its
tariffs
to
all
ports
held
by
alien
powers
except
the
few
free
ports
and
that
there
should
be
no
discrimination
in
railway
and
port
charges
among
the
citizens
of
foreign
countries
operating
in
the
empire
to
these
principles
the
governments
addressed
by
hay
finally
acceded
with
evident
reluctance
illustration
american
dominions
in
the

on
this
basis
he
then
proposed
the
settlement
that
had
to
follow
the
boxer
uprising
the
policy
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
he
said
to
the
great
powers
in
the
summer
of
is
to
seek
a
solution
which
may
bring
about
permanent
safety
and
peace
to
china
preserve
chinese
territorial
and
administrative
entity
protect
all
rights
guaranteed
to
friendly
powers
by
treaty
and
international
law
and
safeguard
for
the
world
the
principle
of
equal
and
impartial
trade
with
all
parts
of
the
chinese
empire
this
was
a
friendly
warning
to
the
world
that
the
united
states
would
not
join
in
a
scramble
to
punish
the
chinese
by
carving
out
more
territory
the
moment
we
acted
said
hay
the
rest
of
the
world
paused
and
finally
came
over
to
our
ground
and
the
german
government
which
is
generally
brutal
but
seldom
silly
recovered
its
senses
and
climbed
down
off
its
perch
in
taking
this
position
the
secretary
of
state
did
but
reflect
the
common
sense
of
america
we
are
of
course
he
explained
opposed
to
the
dismemberment
of
that
empire
and
we
do
not
think
that
the
public
opinion
of
the
united
states
would
justify
this
government
in
taking
part
in
the
great
game
of
spoliation
now
going
on
heavy
damages
were
collected
by
the
european
powers
from
china
for
the
injuries
inflicted
upon
their
citizens
by
the
boxers
but
the
united
states
finding
the
sum
awarded
in
excess
of
the
legitimate
claims
returned
the
balance
in
the
form
of
a
fund
to
be
applied
to
the
education
of
chinese
students
in
american
universities
i
would
rather
be
i
think
said
hay
the
dupe
of
china
than
the
chum
of
the
kaiser
by
pursuing
a
liberal
policy
he
strengthened
the
hold
of
the
united
states
upon
the
affections
of
the
chinese
people
and
in
the
long
run
as
he
remarked
himself
safeguarded
our
great
commercial
interests
in
that
empire
in
the
presidential
campaign
of
it
is
not
strange
that
the
policy
pursued
by
the
republican
administration
in
disposing
of
the
questions
raised
by
the
spanish
war
became
one
of
the
first
issues
in
the
presidential
campaign
of
anticipating
attacks
from
every
quarter
the
republicans
in
renominating
mckinley
set
forth
their
position
in
clear
and
ringing
phrases
in
accepting
by
the
treaty
of
paris
the
just
responsibility
of
our
victories
in
the
spanish
war
the
president
and
senate
won
the
undoubted
approval
of
the
american
people
no
other
course
was
possible
than
to
destroy
spain
sovereignty
throughout
the
west
indies
and
in
the
philippine
islands
that
course
created
our
responsibility
before
the
world
and
with
the
unorganized
population
whom
our
intervention
had
freed
from
spain
to
provide
for
the
maintenance
of
law
and
order
and
for
the
establishment
of
good
government
and
for
the
performance
of
international
obligations
our
authority
could
not
be
less
than
our
responsibility
and
wherever
sovereign
rights
were
extended
it
became
the
high
duty
of
the
government
to
maintain
its
authority
to
put
down
armed
insurrection
and
to
confer
the
blessings
of
liberty
and
civilization
upon
all
the
rescued
peoples
the
largest
measure
of
consistent
with
their
welfare
and
our
duties
shall
be
secured
to
them
by
law
to
give
more
strength
to
their
ticket

republican
convention
in
a
whirlwind
of
enthusiasm
nominated
for
the
vice
presidency
against
his
protest
theodore
roosevelt
the
governor
of
new
york
and
the
hero
of
the
rough
riders
so
popular
on
account
of
their
cuban
campaign
the
democrats
as
expected
picked
up
the
gauntlet
thrown
down
with
such
defiance
by
the
republicans
bryan
whom
they
selected
as
their
candidate
still
clung
to
the
currency
issue
but
the
main
emphasis
both
of
the
platform
and
the
appeal
for
votes
was
on
the
imperialistic
program
of
the
republican
administration
the
democrats
denounced
the
treatment
of
cuba
and
porto
rico
and
condemned
the
philippine
policy
in
sharp
and
vigorous
terms
as
we
are
not
willing
ran
the
platform
to
surrender
our
civilization
or
to
convert
the
republic
into
an
empire
we
favor
an
immediate
declaration
of
the
nation

to
give
to
the
filipinos
first
a
stable
form
of
government
second
independence
third
protection
from
outside
interference
the
greedy
commercialism
which
dictated
the
philippine
policy
of
the
republican
administration
attempts
to
justify
it
with
the
plea
that
it
will
pay
but
even
this
sordid
and
unworthy
plea
fails
when
brought
to
the
test
of
facts
the
war
of
aggression
against
the
filipinos
entailing
an
annual
expense
of
many
millions
has
already
cost
more
than
any
possible
profit
that
could
accrue
from
the
entire
philippine
trade
for
years
to
come
we
oppose
militarism
it
means
conquest
abroad
and
intimidation
and
oppression
at
home
it
means
the
strong
arm
which
has
ever
been
fatal
to
free
institutions
it
is
what
millions
of
our
citizens
have
fled
from
in
europe
it
will
impose
upon
our
people
a
large
standing
army
an
unnecessary
burden
of
taxation
and
would
be
a
constant
menace
to
their
liberties
such
was
the
tenor
of
their
appeal
to
the
voters
with
the
issues
clearly
joined
the
country
rejected
the
democratic
candidate
even
more
positively
than
four
years
before
the
popular
vote
cast
for
mckinley
was
larger
and
that
cast
for
bryan
smaller
than
in
the
silver
election
thus
vindicated
at
the
polls
mckinley
turned
with
renewed
confidence
to
the
development
of
the
policies
he
had
so
far
advanced
but
fate
cut
short
his
designs
in
the
september
following
his
second
inauguration

numerous

gone

the
evolution
of
republican
policies
personality
and
early
career
of
on
september
when
theodore
roosevelt
took
the
oath
of
office
the
presidency
passed
to
a
new
generation
and
a
leader
of
a
new
type
recalling
if
comparisons
must
be
made
andrew
jackson
rather
than
any
republican
predecessor
roosevelt
was
brusque
hearty
restless
and
fond
of
action
a
young
fellow
of
infinite
dash
and
originality
as
john
hay
remarked
of
him
combining
the
spirit
of
his
old
college
harvard
with
the
breezy
freedom
of
the
plains
interested
in
everything
a
new
species
of
game
a
new

a
diplomatic
riddle
or
a
novel
theory
of
history
or
biology
though
only
years
old
he
was
well
versed
in
the
art
of
practical
politics
coming
upon
the
political
scene
in
the
early
eighties
he
had
associated
himself
with
the
reformers
in
the
republican
party
but
he
was
no
mugwump
from
the
first
he
vehemently
preached
the
doctrine
of
party
loyalty
if
beaten
in
the
convention
he
voted
the
straight
ticket
in
the
election
for
twenty
years
he
adhered
to
this
rule
and
during
a
considerable
portion
of
that
period
he
held
office
as
a
spokesman
of
his
party
he
served
in
the
new
york
legislature
as
head
of
the
metropolitan
police
force
as
federal
civil
service
commissioner
under
president
harrison
as
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
under
president
mckinley
and
as
governor
of
the
empire
state
political
managers
of
the
old
school
spoke
of
him
as
brilliant
but
erratic
they
soon
found
him
equal
to
the
shrewdest
in
negotiation
and
action

the
most
important
foreign
question
confronting
president
roosevelt
on
the
day
of
his
inauguration
that
of
the
panama
canal
was
a
heritage
from
his
predecessor
the
idea
of
a
water
route
across
the
isthmus
long
a
dream
of
navigators
had
become
a
living
issue
after
the
historic
voyage
of
the
battleship
around
south
america
during
the
spanish
war
but
before
the
united
states
could
act
it
had
to
undo
the
treaty
made
with
great
britain
in
providing
for
the
construction
of
the
canal
under
joint
supervision
this
was
finally
effected
by
the
treaty
of
authorizing
the
united
states
to
proceed
alone
on
condition
that
there
should
be
no
discriminations
against
other
nations
in
the
matter
of
rates
and
charges
this
accomplished
it
was
necessary
to
decide
just
where
the
canal
should
be
built
one
group
in
congress
favored
the
route
through
nicaragua
in
fact
two
official
commissions
had
already
approved
that
location
another
group
favored
cutting
the
way
through
panama
after
purchasing
the
rights
of
the
old
french
company
which
under
the
direction
of
de
lesseps
the
hero
of
the
suez
canal
had
made
a
costly
failure
some
twenty
years
before
after
a
heated
argument
over
the
merits
of
the
two
plans
preference
was
given
to
the
panama
route
as
the
isthmus
was
then
a
part
of
colombia
president
roosevelt
proceeded
to
negotiate
with
the
government
at
bogota
a
treaty
authorizing
the
united
states
to
cut
a
canal
through
its
territory
the
treaty
was
easily
framed
but
it
was
rejected
by
the
colombian
senate
much
to
the
president
exasperation
you
could
no
more
make
an
agreement
with
the
colombian
rulers
he
exclaimed
than
you
could
nail
jelly
to
a
wall
he
was
spared
the
necessity
by
a
timely
revolution
on
november
panama
renounced
its
allegiance
to
colombia
and
three
days
later
the
united
states
recognized
its
independence

this
amazing
incident
was
followed
shortly
by
the
signature
of
a
treaty
between
panama
and
the
united
states
in
which
the
latter
secured
the
right
to
construct
the
canal
in
return
for
a
guarantee
of
independence
and
certain
cash
payments
the
rights
and
property
of
the
french
concern
were

to
criticize

roosevelt
for
the
way
in
which
he
snapped
off
negotiations
with

and
recognized
the

their
attention
was
drawn
to
the
magnificent
outcome

the
affair
notwithstanding

a

in
the
winter
of
there
broke
out
between
japan
and
russia
a
terrible
conflict
over
the
division
of
spoils
in
manchuria
the
fortunes
of
war
were
with
the
agile
forces
of
nippon
in
this
struggle
it
seems
president
roosevelt
sympathies
were
mainly
with
the
japanese
although
he
observed
the
proprieties
of
neutrality
at
all
events
secretary
hay
wrote
in
his
diary
on
new
year
day
that
the
president
was
quite
firm
in
his
view
that
we
can
not
permit
japan
to
be
robbed
a
second
time
of
her
victory
referring
to
the
fact
that
japan
ten
years
before
after
defeating
china
on
the
field
of
battle
had
been
forced
by
russia
germany
and
france
to
forego
the
fruits
of
conquest
whatever
the
president
personal
feelings
may
have
been
he
was
aware
that
japan
despite
her
triumphs
over
russia
was
staggering
under
a
heavy
burden
of
debt
at
a
suggestion
from
tokyo
he
invited
both
belligerents
in
the
summer
of
to
join
in
a
peace
conference
the
celerity
of
their
reply
was
aided
by
the
pressure
of
european
bankers
who
had
already
come
to
a
substantial
agreement
that
the
war
must
stop
after
some
delay
portsmouth
new
hampshire
was
chosen
as
the
meeting
place
for
the
spokesmen
of
the
two
warring
powers
roosevelt
presided
over
the
opening
ceremonies
with
fine
urbanity
thoroughly
enjoying
the
justly
earned
honor
of
being
for
the
moment
at
the
center
of
the
interest
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
conference
end
in
a
treaty
of
peace
and
amity
monroe
doctrine
applied
to
less
spectacular
than
the
settlement
but
not
less
important
was
a
diplomatic
with
germany
over
the
monroe
doctrine
this
clash
grew
out
of
the
inability
or
unwillingness
of
the
venezuelan
government
to
pay
debts
due
foreign
creditors
having
exhausted
their
patience
in
negotiations
england
and
germany
in
december
sent
battleships
to
establish
what
they
characterized
as
a
peaceful
blockade
of
venezuelan
ports
their
action
was
followed
by
the
rupture
of
diplomatic
relations
there
was
a
possibility
that
war
and
the
occupation
of
venezuelan
territory
might
result
while
unwilling
to
stand
between
a
country
and
its
creditors
president
roosevelt
was
determined
that
debt
collecting
should
not
be
made
an
excuse
for
european
countries
to
seize
territory
he
therefore
urged
arbitration
of
the
dispute
winning
the
assent
of
england
and
italy
germany
with
a
somewhat
haughty
air
refused
to
take
the
milder
course
the
president
learning
of
this
refusal
called
the
german
ambassador
to
the
white
house
and
informed
him
in
very
precise
terms
that
unless
the
imperial
german
government
consented
to
arbitrate
admiral
dewey
would
be
ordered
to
the
scene
with
instructions
to
prevent
germany
from
seizing
any
venezuelan
territory
a
week
passed
and
no
answer
came
from
berlin
not
baffled
the
president
again
took
the
matter
up
with
the
ambassador
this
time
with
even
more
firmness
he
stated
in
language
admitting
of
but
one
meaning
that
unless
within
hours
the
emperor
consented
to
arbitration
american
battleships
already
coaled
and
cleared
would
sail
for
venezuelan
waters
the
hint
was
sufficient
the
kaiser
accepted
the
proposal
and
the
president
with
the
fine
irony
of
diplomacy
complimented
him
publicly
on
being
so
stanch
an
advocate
of
arbitration
in
terms
of
the
monroe
doctrine
this
action
meant
that
the
united
states
while
not
denying
the
obligations
of
debtors
would
not
permit
any
move
on
the
part
of
european
powers
that
might
easily
lead
to
the
temporary
or
permanent
occupation
of
territory
santo
domingo
the
same
issue
was
involved
in
a
controversy
over
santo
domingo
which
arose
in
the
dominican
republic
like
venezuela
was
heavily
in
debt
and
certain
european
countries
declared
that
unless
the
united
states
undertook
to
look
after
the
finances
of
the
embarrassed
debtor
they
would
resort
to
armed
coercion
what
was
the
united
states
to
do
the
danger
of
having
some
european
power
strongly
intrenched
in
santo
domingo
was
too
imminent
to
be
denied
president
roosevelt
acted
with
characteristic
speed
and
notwithstanding
strong
opposition
in
the
senate
was
able
in
to
effect
a
treaty
arrangement
which
placed
dominican
finances
under
american
supervision
in
the
course
of
the
debate
over
this
settlement
a
number
of
interesting
questions
arose
it
was
pertinently
asked
whether
the
american
navy
should
be
used
to
help
creditors
collect
their
debts
anywhere
in
it
was
suggested
also
that
no
sanction
should
be
given
to
the
practice
among
european
governments
of
using
armed
force
to
collect
private
claims
opponents
of
president
roosevelt
policy
and
they
were
neither
few
nor
insignificant
urged
that
such
matters
should
be
referred
to
the
hague
court
or
to
special
international
commissions
for
arbitration
to
this
the
answer
was
made
that
the
united
states
could
not
surrender
any
question
coming
under
the
terms
of
the
monroe
doctrine
to
the
decision
of
an
international
tribunal
the
position
of
the
administration
was
very
clearly
stated
by
president
roosevelt
himself
the
country
he
said
would
certainly
decline
to
go
to
war
to
prevent
a
foreign
government
from
collecting
a
just
debt
on
the
other
hand
it
is
very
inadvisable
to
permit
any
foreign
power
to
take
possession
even
temporarily
of
the
customs
houses
of
an
american
republic
in
order
to
enforce
the
payment
of
its
obligations
for
such
a
temporary
occupation
might
turn
into
a
permanent
occupation
the
only
escape
from
these
alternatives
may
at
any
time
be
that
we
must
ourselves
undertake
to
bring
about
some
arrangement
by
which
so
much
as
possible
of
a
just
obligation
shall
be
paid
the
monroe
doctrine
was
negative
it
denied
to
european
powers
a
certain
liberty
of
operation
in
this
hemisphere
the
positive
obligations
resulting
from
its
application
by
the
united
states
were
points
now
emphasized
and
developed
hague
the
controversies
over
relations
and
his
part
in
bringing
the
war
to
a
close
naturally
made
a
deep
impression
upon
roosevelt
turning
his
mind
in
the
direction
of
the
peaceful
settlement
of
international
disputes
the
subject
was
moreover
in
the
air
as
if
conscious
of
impending
calamity
the
statesmen
of
the
old
world
to
all
outward
signs
at
least
seemed
searching
for
a
way
to
reduce
armaments
and
avoid
the
bloody
and
costly
trial
of
international
causes
by
the
ancient
process
of
battle
it
was
the
czar
nicholas
ii
fated
to
die
in
one
of
the
terrible
holocausts
which
he
helped
to
bring
upon
mankind
who
summoned
the
delegates
of
the
nations
in
the
first
hague
peace
conference
in
the
conference
did
nothing
to
reduce
military
burdens
or
avoid
wars
but
it
did
recognize
the
right
of
friendly
nations
to
offer
the
services
of
mediation
to
countries
at
war
and
did
establish
a
court
at
the
hague
for
the
arbitration
of
international
disputes
encouraged
by
this
experiment
feeble
as
it
was
president
roosevelt
in
proposed
a
second
conference
yielding
to
the
czar
the
honor
of
issuing
the
call
at
this
great
international
assembly
held
at
the
hague
in
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
proposed
a
plan
for
the
compulsory
arbitration
of
certain
matters
of
international
dispute
this
was
rejected
with
contempt
by
germany
reduction
of
armaments
likewise
proposed
in
the
conference
was
again
deferred
in
fact
nothing
was
accomplished
beyond
agreement
upon
certain
rules
for
the
conduct
of
civilized
warfare
casting
a
somewhat
lurid
light
upon
the
pacific
intentions
of
most
of
the
powers
assembled
world
tour
of
the
as
if
to
assure
the
world
then
that
the
united
states
placed
little
reliance
upon
the
frail
reed
of
peace
conferences
roosevelt
the
following
year
made
an
imposing
display
of
american
naval
power
by
sending
a
fleet
of
sixteen
battleships
on
a
tour
around
the
globe
on
his
own
authority
he
ordered
the
ships
to
sail
out
of
hampton
roads
and

japan
and
the
suez
canal
this
enterprise
was
not
as
some
critics
claimed
a
mere
boyish
flourish
president
roosevelt
knew
how
deep
was
the
influence
of
sea
power
on
the
fate
of
nations
he
was
aware
that
no
country
could
have
a
wide
empire
of
trade
and
dominion
without
force
adequate
to
sustain
it
the
voyage
around
the
world
therefore
served
a
double
purpose
it
interested
his
own
country
in
the
naval
program
of
the
government
and
it
reminded
other
powers
that
the
american
giant
though
quiet
was
not
sleeping
in
the
midst
of
international
rivalries
colonial
administration
constitutional
question
in
colonial
administration
as
in
foreign
policy
president
roosevelt
advanced
with
firm
step
in
a
path
already
marked
out
president
mckinley
had
defined
the
principles
that
were
to
control
the
development
of
porto
rico
and
the
philippines
the
republican
party
had
announced
a
program
of
pacification
gradual
and
commercial
improvement
the
only
remaining
question
of
importance
to
use
the
popular
phrase
does
the
constitution
follow
the
flag
had
been
answered
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
although
it
was
well
known
that
the
constitution
did
not
contemplate
the
government
of
dependencies
such
as
the
philippines
and
porto
rico
the
court
by
generous
and
ingenious
interpretations
found
a
way
for
congress
to
apply
any
reasonable
rules
required
by
the
occasion
the
government
of
porto
rico
was
a
relatively
simple
matter
it
was
a
single
island
with
a
fairly
homogeneous
population
apart
from
the
spanish
upper
class
for
a
time
after
military
occupation
in
it
was
administered
under
military
rule
this
was
succeeded
by
the
establishment
of
civil
government
under
the
organic
act
passed
by
congress
in
the
law
assured
to
the
porto
ricans
american
protection
but
withheld
american
citizenship
a
boon
finally
granted
in
it
provided
for
a
governor
and
six
executive
secretaries
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
approval
of
the
senate
and
for
a
legislature
of
two
houses
one
elected
by
popular
native
vote
and
an
upper
chamber
composed
of
the
executive
secretaries
and
five
other
persons
appointed
in
the
same
manner
thus
the
united
states
turned
back
to
the
provincial
system
maintained
by
england
in
virginia
or
new
york
in
old
colonial
days
the
natives
were
given
a
voice
in
their
government
and
the
power
of
initiating
laws
but
the
final
word
both
in
and
administration
was
vested
in
officers
appointed
in
washington
such
was
the
plan
under
which
the
affairs
of
porto
rico
were
conducted
by
president
roosevelt
it
lasted
until
the
new
organic
act
of
illustration
from
underwood
and
underwood
a
sugar
mill
porto
rico
the
administration
of
the
philippines
presented
far
more
difficult
questions
the
number
of
islands
the
variety
of
languages
and
races
the
differences
in
civilization
all
combined
to
challenge
the
skill
of
the
government
moreover
there
was
raging
in
a
stubborn
revolt
against
american
authority
which
had
to
be
faced
following
the
lines
laid
down
by
president
mckinley
the
evolution
of
american
policy
fell
into
three
stages
at
first
the
islands
were
governed
directly
by
the
president
under
his
supreme
military
power
in
a
civilian
commission
headed
by
william
howard
taft
was
selected
by
the
president
and
charged
with
the
government
of
the
provinces
in
which
order
had
been
restored
six
years
later
under
the
terms
of
an
organic
act
passed
by
congress
in
the
third
stage
was
reached
the
local
government
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
governor
and
commission
appointed
by
the
president
and
senate
and
a
legislature
one
house
elected
by
popular
vote
and
an
upper
chamber
composed
of
the
commission
this
scheme
like
that
obtaining
in
porto
rico
remained
intact
until
a
democratic
congress
under
president
wilson
leadership
carried
the
colonial
administration
into
its
fourth
phase
by
making
both
houses
elective
thus
by
the
steady
pursuit
of
a
liberal
policy
was
extended
to
the
dependencies
but
it
encouraged
rather
than
extinguished
the
vigorous
movement
among
the
philippine
natives
for
independence
illustration
by
underwood
and
underwood
mr
taft
in
the
philippines
within
the
sphere
of
colonial
affairs
cuba
though
nominally
independent
also
presented
problems
to
the
government
at
washington
in
the
fine
enthusiasm
that
accompanied
the
declaration
of
war
on
spain
congress
unmindful
of
practical
considerations
recognized
the
independence
of
cuba
and
disclaimed
any
disposition
or
intention
to
exercise
sovereignty
jurisdiction
or
control
over
said
island
except
for
the
pacification
thereof
in
the
settlement
that
followed
the
war
however
it
was
deemed
undesirable
to
set
the
young
republic
adrift
upon
the
stormy
sea
of
international
politics
without
a
guiding
hand
before
withdrawing
american
troops
from
the
island
congress
in
march
enacted
and
required
cuba
to
approve
a
series
of
restrictions
known
as
the
platt
amendment
limiting
her
power
to
incur
indebtedness
securing
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
intervene
whenever
necessary
to
protect
life
and
property
and
reserving
to
the
united
states
coaling
stations
at
certain
points
to
be
agreed
upon
the
cubans
made
strong
protests
against
what
they
deemed
infringements
of
their
sovereignty
but
finally
with
good
grace
accepted
their
fate
even
when
in
president
roosevelt
landed
american
troops
in
the
island
to
quell
a
domestic
dissension
they
acquiesced
in
the
action
evidently
regarding
it
as
a
distinct
warning
that
they
should
learn
to
manage
their
elections
in
an
orderly
manner
the
roosevelt
domestic
policies
questions
to
the
from
the
day
of
his
inauguration
to
the
close
of
his
service
in
president
roosevelt
in
messages
speeches
and
interviews
kept
up
a
lively
and
interesting
discussion
of
trusts
capital
labor
poverty
riches
lawbreaking
good
citizenship
and
kindred
themes
many
a
subject
previously
touched
upon
only
by
representatives
of
the
minor
and
dissenting
parties
he
dignified
by
a
careful
examination
that
he
did
this
with
any
fixed
design
or
policy
in
mind
does
not
seem
to
be
the
case
he
admitted
himself
that
when
he
became
president
he
did
not
have
in
hand
any
settled
or
plan
of
social
betterment
he
did
have
however
serious
convictions
on
general
principles
i
was
bent
upon
making
the
government
he
wrote
the
most
efficient
possible
instrument
in
helping
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
better
themselves
in
every
way
politically
socially
and
industrially
i
believed
with
all
my
heart
in
real
and
democracy
and
i
wished
to
make
the
democracy
industrial
as
well
as
political
although
i
had
only
partially
formulated
the
method
i
believed
we
should
follow
it
is
thus
evident
at
least
that
he
had
departed
a
long
way
from
the
old
idea
of
the
government
as
nothing
but
a
great
policeman
keeping
order
among
the
people
in
a
struggle
over
the
distribution
of
the
nation
wealth
and
resources
view
of
the
equally
significant
was
roosevelt
attitude
toward
the
constitution
and
the
office
of
president
he
utterly
repudiated
the
narrow
construction
of
our
national
charter
he
held
that
the
constitution
should
be
treated
as
the
greatest
document
ever
devised
by
the
wit
of
man
to
aid
a
people
in
exercising
every
power
necessary
for
its
own
betterment
not
as
a
cunningly
fashioned
to
strangle
growth
he
viewed
the
presidency
as
he
did
the
constitution
strict
constructionists
of
the
jeffersonian
school
of
whom
there
were
many
on
occasion
even
in
the
republican
party
had
taken
a
view
that
the
president
could
do
nothing
that
he
was
not
specifically
authorized
by
the
constitution
to
do
roosevelt
took
exactly
the
opposite
position
it
was
his
opinion
that
it
was
not
only
the
president
right
but
his
duty
to
do
anything
that
the
needs
of
the
nation
demanded
unless
such
action
was
forbidden
by
the
constitution
or
the
laws
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
acted
for
the
common
of
all
our
people
whenever
and
in
whatever
manner
was
necessary
unless
prevented
by
direct
constitutional
or
legislative
prohibition
trusts
and
to
the
trust
question
roosevelt
devoted
especial
attention
this
was
unavoidable
by
far
the
larger
part
of
the
business
of
the
country
was
done
by
corporations
as
distinguished
from
partnerships
and
individual
owners
the
growth
of
these
gigantic
aggregations
of
capital
had
been
the
leading
feature
in
american
industrial
development
during
the
last
two
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
conquest
of
business
by
trusts
and
the
resulting
private
fortunes
of
great
magnitude
the
populists
and
the
democrats
had
seen
a
grievous
danger
to
the
republic
plutocracy
has
taken
the
place
of
democracy
the
tariff
breeds
trusts
let
us
destroy
therefore
the
tariff
and
the
trusts
such
was
the
battle
cry
which
had
been
taken
up
by
bryan
and
his
followers
president
roosevelt
countered
vigorously
he
rejected
the
idea
that
the
trusts
were
the
product
of
the
tariff
or
of
governmental
action
of
any
kind
he
insisted
that
they
were
the
outcome
of
natural
economic
forces
destructive
competition
among
business
men
compelling
them
to
avoid
ruin
by
coöperation
in
fixing
prices
the
growth
of
markets
on
a
national
scale
and
even
international
scale
calling
for
vast
accumulations
of
capital
to
carry
on
such
business
the
possibility
of
immense
savings
by
the
union
of
many
plants
under
one
management
in
the
corporation
he
saw
a
new
stage
in
the
development
of
american
industry
unregulated
competition
he
regarded
as
the
source
of
evils
which
all
men
concede
must
be
remedied
if
this
civilization
of
ours
is
to
survive
the
notion
therefore
that
these
immense
business
concerns
should
be
or
could
be
broken
up
by
a
decree
of
law
roosevelt
considered
absurd
at
the
same
time
he
proposed
that
evil
trusts
should
be
prevented
from
of
any
kind
that
is
punished
for
plain
swindling
for
making
agreements
to
limit
output
for
refusing
to
sell
to
customers
who
dealt
with
rival
firms
and
for
conspiracies
with
railways
to
ruin
competitors
by
charging
high
freight
rates
and
for
similar
abuses
accordingly
he
proposed
not
the
destruction
of
the
trusts
but
their
regulation
by
the
government
this
he
contended
would
preserve
the
advantages
of
business
on
a
national
scale
while
preventing
the
evils
that
accompanied
it
the
railway
company
he
declared
to
be
a
public
servant
its
rates
should
be
just
to
and
open
to
all
shippers
alike
so
he
answered
those
who
thought
that
trusts
and
railway
combinations
were
private
concerns
to
be
managed
solely
by
their
owners
without
let
or
hindrance
and
also
those
who
thought
trusts
and
railway
combinations
could
be
abolished
by
tariff
reduction
or
criminal
prosecution
labor
on
the
labor
question
then
pressing
to
the
front
in
public
interest
president
roosevelt
took
advanced
ground
for
his
time
he
declared
that
the
and
threatened
with
starvation
if
unemployed
was
no
match
for
the
employer
who
was
able
to
bargain
and
wait
this
led
him
accordingly
to
accept
the
principle
of
the
trade
union
namely
that
only
by
collective
bargaining
can
labor
be
put
on
a
footing
to
measure
its
strength
equally
with
capital
while
he
severely
arraigned
labor
leaders
who
advocated
violence
and
destructive
doctrines
he
held
that
the
organization
of
labor
into
trade
unions
and
federations
is
necessary
is
beneficent
and
is
one
of
the
greatest
possible
agencies
in
the
attainment
of
a
true
industrial
as
well
as
a
true
political
democracy
in
the
united
states
the
last
resort
of
trade
unions
in
labor
disputes
the
strike
he
approved
in
case
negotiations
failed
to
secure
a
fair
deal
he
thought
however
that
labor
organizations
even
if
wisely
managed
could
not
solve
all
the
pressing
social
questions
of
the
time
the
aid
of
the
government
at
many
points
he
believed
to
be
necessary
to
eliminate
undeserved
poverty
industrial
diseases
unemployment
and
the
unfortunate
consequences
of
industrial
accidents
in
his
first
message
of
for
instance
he
urged
that
workers
injured
in
industry
should
have
certain
and
ample
compensation
from
time
to
time
he
advocated
other
legislation
to
obtain
what
he
called
a
larger
measure
of
social
and
industrial
justice
riches
and
even
the
challenge
of
the
radicals
such
as
the
populists
who
alleged
that
the
toil
of
millions
is
boldly
stolen
to
build
up
colossal
fortunes
for
a
few
challenges
which
his
predecessors
did
not
consider
worthy
of
notice
president
roosevelt
refused
to
let
pass
without
an
answer
in
his
first
message
he
denied
the
truth
of
the
common
saying
that
the
rich
were
growing
richer
and
the
poor
were
growing
poorer
he
asserted
that
on
the
contrary
the
average
man
wage
worker
farmer
and
small
business
man
was
better
off
than
ever
before
in
the
history
of
our
country
that
there
had
been
abuses
in
the
accumulation
of
wealth
he
did
not
pretend
to
ignore
but
he
believed
that
even
immense
fortunes
on
the
whole
represented
positive
benefits
conferred
upon
the
country
nevertheless
he
felt
that
grave
dangers
to
the
safety
and
the
happiness
of
the
people
lurked
in
great
inequalities
of
wealth
in
he
wrote
that
he
wished
it
were
in
his
power
to
prevent
the
heaping
up
of
enormous
fortunes
the
next
year
to
the
astonishment
of
many
leaders
in
his
own
party
he
boldly
announced
in
a
message
to
congress
that
he
approved
both
income
and
inheritance
taxes
then
generally
viewed
as
populist
or
democratic
measures
he
even
took
the
stand
that
such
taxes
should
be
laid
in
order
to
bring
about
a
more
equitable
distribution
of
wealth
and
greater
equality
of
opportunity
among
citizens
legislative
and
executive
activities
when
president
roosevelt
turned
from
the
field
of
opinion
he
found
himself
in
a
different
sphere
many
of
his
views
were
too
advanced
for
the
members
of
his
party
in
congress
and
where
results
depended
upon
the
making
of
new
laws
his
progress
was
slow
nevertheless
in
his
administrations
several
measures
were
enacted
that
bore
the
stamp
of
his
theories
though
it
could
hardly
be
said
that
he
dominated
congress
to
the
same
degree
as
did
some
other
presidents
the
hepburn
railway
act
of
enlarged
the
interstate
commerce
commission
it
extended
the
commission
power
over
oil
pipe
lines
express
companies
and
other
interstate
carriers
it
gave
the
commission
the
right
to
reduce
rates
found
to
be
unreasonable
and
discriminatory
it
forbade
midnight
tariffs
that
is
sudden
changes
in
rates
favoring
certain
shippers
and
it
prohibited
common
carriers
from
transporting
goods
owned
by
themselves
especially
coal
except
for
their
own
proper
use
two
important
pure
food
and
drug
laws
enacted
during
the
same
year
were
designed
to
protect
the
public
against
diseased
meats
and
deleterious
foods
and
drugs
a
significant
piece
of
labor
legislation
was
an
act
of
the
same
congress
making
interstate
railways
liable
to
damages
for
injuries
sustained
by
their
employees
when
this
measure
was
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
supreme
court
it
was
reënacted
with
the
objectionable
clauses
removed
a
second
installment
of
labor
legislation
was
offered
in
the
law
of
limiting
the
hours
of
railway
employees
engaged
as
trainmen

operators

interested
president
roosevelt
no
less
than
railway
and
industrial
questions
indeed
in
his
first
message
to
congress
he
placed
the
conservation
of
natural
resources
among
the
most
vital
internal
problems
of
the
age
and
forcibly
emphasized
an
issue
that
had
been
discussed
in
a
casual
way
since
cleveland
first
administration
the
suggestion
evoked
an
immediate
response
in
congress
under
the
leadership
of
senator
newlands
of
nevada
the
reclamation
act
of
was
passed
providing
for
the
redemption
of
the
desert
areas
of
the
west
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
public
lands
were
dedicated
to
the
construction
of
storage
dams
and
sluiceways
to
hold
water
and
divert
it
as
needed
to
the
thirsty
sands
furthermore
it
was
stipulated
that
the
rents
paid
by
water
users
should
go
into
a
reclamation
fund
to
continue
the
good
work
forever
construction
was
started
immediately
under
the
terms
of
the
law
within
seventeen
years
about
acres
had
been
reclaimed
and
more
than
a
million
were
actually
irrigated
in
the
single
year
the
crops
of
the
irrigated
districts
were
valued
at
approximately
in
his
first
message
also
president
roosevelt
urged
the
transfer
of
all
control
over
national
forests
to
trained
men
in
the
bureau
of
forestry
a
recommendation
carried
out
in
when
the
forestry
service
was
created
in
every
direction
noteworthy
advances
were
made
in
the
administration
of
the
national
domain
the
science
of

were
instituted
against

an

was
begun
which
bore

president

was
also
a
distinct
personality
his
discrimination
between
good
and
bad
trusts
led
him
to
prosecute
some
of
them
with
vigor
on
his
initiative
the
northern

of
certain

the
roosevelt
theory
that
the
president
could
do
anything
for
public
welfare
not
forbidden
by
the
constitution
and
the
laws
was
put
to
a
severe
test
in
a
strike
of
the
anthracite
coal
miners
which
started
in
the
summer
ran
late
into
the
autumn
industries
were
paralyzed
for
the

were
threatened
with
the
appalling
menace
of
a
winter
without
heat
governors
and
mayors
were
powerless
and
appealed
for
aid
the
mine
owners
rejected
the
demands
of
the
men
and
refused
to
permit
the
arbitration
of
the
points
in
dispute
although
john
mitchell
the
leader
of
the
miners
repeatedly
urged
it
after
observing
closely
the
course
affairs
president
roosevelt
made
up
his
mind
that
the
situation
was
intolerable
he
arranged
to
have
the
federal
troops
if
necessary
take
possession
of
the
mines
and
operate
them
until
the
strike
could
be
settled
he
then
invited
the
contestants
to
the
white
house
and
by
dint
of
hard
labor
induced
them
to
accept
as
a
substitute
or
compromise
arbitration
by
a
commission
which
he
appointed
thus
by
stepping
outside
the
constitution
and
acting
as
the
first
citizen
of
the
land
president
roosevelt
averted
a
crisis
of
great
magnitude
election
of
the
views
and
measures
which
he
advocated
with
such
vigor
aroused
deep
hostility
within
as
well
as
without
his
party
there
were
rumors
of
a
republican
movement
to
defeat
his
nomination
in
and
it
was
said
that
the
financial
and
corporation
interests
were
in
arms
against
him
a
prominent
republican
paper
in
new
york
city
accused
him
of
having
stolen
bryan
thunder
by
harrying
the
trusts
and
favoring
labor
unions
when
the
republican
convention
assembled
in
chicago
however
the
opposition
disappeared
and
roosevelt
was
nominated
by
acclamation
this
was
the
signal
for
a
change
on
the
part
of
democratic
leaders
they
denounced
the
president
as
erratic
dangerous
and
radical
and
decided
to
assume
the
moderate
rôle
themselves
they
put
aside
bryan
and
selected
as
their
candidate
judge
alton
parker
of
new
york
a
man
who
repudiated
free
silver
and
made
a
direct
appeal
for
the
conservative
vote
the
outcome
of
the
reversal
was
astounding
judge
parker
vote
fell
more
than
a
million
below
that
cast
for
bryan
in
of
the
electoral
votes
he
received
only
roosevelt
in
addition
to
sweeping
the
republican
sections
even
invaded
democratic
territory
carrying
the
state
of
missouri
thus
vindicated
at
the
polls
he
became
more
outspoken
than
ever
his
leadership
in
the
party
was
so
widely
recognized
that
he
virtually
selected
his
own
successor
the
administration
of
president
taft
campaign
of
long
before
the
end
of
his
elective
term
president
roosevelt
let
it
be
known
that
he
favored
as
his
successor
william
howard
taft
of
ohio
his
secretary
of
war
to
attain
this
end
he
used
every
shred
of
his
powerful
influence
when
the
republican
convention
assembled
taft
easily
won
the
nomination
though
the
party
platform
was
conservative
in
tone
he
gave
it
a
progressive
tinge
by
expressing
his
personal
belief
in
the
popular
election
of
united
states
senators
an
income
tax
and
other
liberal
measures
president
roosevelt
announced
his
faith
in
the
republican
candidate
and
appealed
to
the
country
for
his
election
the
turn
in
republican
affairs
now
convinced
bryan
that
the
signs
were
propitious
for
a
third
attempt
to
win
the
presidency
the
disaster
to
judge
parker
had
taught
the
party
that
victory
did
not
lie
in
a
conservative
policy
with
little
difficulty
therefore
the
veteran
leader
from
nebraska
once
more
rallied
the
democrats
around
his
standard
won
the
nomination
and
wrote
a
platform
vigorously
attacking
the
tariff
trusts
and
monopolies
supported
by
a
loyal
following
he
entered
the
lists
only
to
meet
another
defeat
though
he
polled
almost
a
million
and
a
half
more
votes
than
did
judge
parker
in
the
palm
went
to
taft
tariff
revision
and
party
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
term
president
taft
had
to
face
the
tariff
issue
he
had
met
it
in
the
campaign
moved
by
the
democratic
demand
for
a
drastic
reduction
he
had
expressed
opinions
which
were
thought
to
imply
a
downward
revision
the
democrats
made
much
of
the
implication
and
the
republicans
from
the
middle
west
rejoiced
in
it
pressure
was
coming
from
all
sides
more
than
ten
years
had
elapsed
since
the
enactment
of
the
dingley
bill
and
the
position
of
many
industries
had
been
altered
with
the
course
of
time
evidently
the
day
for
revision
at
best
a
thankless
task
had
arrived
taft
accepted
the
inevitable
and
called
congress
in
a
special
session
until
the
midsummer
of
republican
senators
and
representatives
wrangled
over
tariff
schedules
the
president
making
little
effort
to
influence
their
decisions
when
on
august
the
bill
became
a
law
a
breach
had
been
made
in
republican
ranks
powerful
senators
from
the
middle
west
had
spoken
angrily
against
many
of
the
high
rates
imposed
by
the
bill
they
had
even
broken
with
their
party
colleagues
to
vote
against
the
entire
scheme
of
tariff
revision
income
tax
the
rift
in
party
harmony
was
widened
by
another
serious
difference
of
opinion
during
the
debate
on
the
tariff
bill
there
was
a
concerted
movement
to
include
in
it
an
income
tax
provision
this
in
spite
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
declaring
it
unconstitutional
conservative
men
were
alarmed
by
the
evident
willingness
of
some
members
to
flout
a
solemn
decree
of
that
eminent
tribunal
at
the
same
time
they
saw
a
powerful
combination
of
republicans
and
democrats
determined
upon
shifting
some
of
the
burden
of
taxation
to
large
incomes
in
the
press
of
circumstances
a
compromise
was
reached
the
income
tax
bill
was
dropped
for
the
present
but
congress
passed
the
sixteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
authorizing
taxes
upon
incomes
from
whatever
source
they
might
be
derived
without
reference
to
any
apportionment
among
the
states
on
the
basis
of
population
the
states
ratified
the
amendment
and
early
in
it
was
proclaimed
taft
after
the
enactment
of
the
tariff
bill
taft
continued
to
push
forward
with
his
legislative
program
he
recommended
and
congress
created
a
special
court
of
commerce
with
jurisdiction
among
other
things
over
appeals
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
thus
facilitating
judicial
review
of
the
railway
rates
fixed
and
the
orders
issued
by
that
body
this
measure
was
quickly
followed
by
an
act
establishing
a
system
of
postal
savings
banks
in
connection
with
the
post
office
a
scheme
which
had
long
been
opposed
by
private
banks
two
years
later
congress
defied
the
lobby
of
the
express
companies
and
supplemented
the
savings
banks
with
a
parcels
post
system
thus
enabling
the
american
postal
service
to
catch
up
with
that
of
other
progressive
nations
with
a
view
to
improving
the
business
administration
of
the
federal
government
the
president
obtained
from
congress
a
large
appropriation
for
an
economy
and
efficiency
commission
charged
with
the
duty
of
inquiring
into
wasteful
and
obsolete
methods
and
recommending
improved
devices
and
practices
the
chief
result
of
this
investigation
was
a
vigorous
report
in
favor
of
a
national
budget
system
which
soon
found
public
backing
president
taft
negotiated
with
england
and
france
general
treaties
providing
for
the
arbitration
of
disputes
which
were
justiciable
in
character
even
though
they
might
involve
questions
of
vital
interest
and
national
honor
they
were
coldly
received
in
the
senate
and
so
amended
that
taft
abandoned
them
altogether
a
tariff
reciprocity
agreement
with
canada
however
he
forced
through
congress
in
the
face
of
strong
opposition
from
his
own
party
after
making
a
serious
breach
in
republican
ranks
he
was
chagrined
to
see
the
whole
scheme
come
to
naught
by
the
overthrow
of
the
liberals
in
the
canadian
elections
of
of
the
the
party
schism
was
even
enlarged
by
what
appeared
to
be
the
successful
prosecution
of
several
great
combinations
in
two
important
cases
the
supreme
court
ordered
the
dissolution
of
the
standard
oil
company
and
the
american
tobacco
company
on
the
ground
that
they
violated
the
sherman
law
in
taking
this
step
chief
justice
white
was
at
some
pains
to
state
that
the
law
did
not
apply
to
combinations
which
did
not
unduly
restrain
trade
his
remark
construed
to
mean
that
the
court
would
not
interfere
with
corporations
as
such
became
the
subject
of
a
popular
outcry
against
the
president
and
the
judges
progressive
insurgency
and
the
election
of
all
in
all
taft
administration
from
the
first
day
had
been
disturbed
by
party
discord
high
words
had
passed
over
the
tariff
bill
and
disgruntled
members
of
congress
could
not
forget
them
to
differences
over
issues
were
added
quarrels
between
youth
and
old
age
in
the
house
of
representatives
there
developed
a
group
of
young
insurgent
republicans
who
resented
the
dominance
of
the
speaker
joseph
cannon
and
other
members
of
the
old
guard
as
they
named
the
men
of
long
service
and
conservative
minds
in
the
insurgents
went
so
far
as
to
join
with
the
democrats
in
a
movement
to
break
the
speaker
sway
by
ousting
him
from
the
rules
committee
and
depriving
him
of
the
power
to
appoint
its
members
the
storm
was
brewing
in
the
autumn
of
that
year
the
democrats
won
a
clear
majority
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
began
an
open
battle
with
president
taft
by
demanding
an
immediate
downward
revision
of
the
tariff
rise
of
the
progressive
preparatory
to
the
campaign
of
the
dissenters
within
the
republican
party
added
the
prefix
progressive
to
their
old
title
and
began
to
organize
a
movement
to
prevent
the
renomination
of
taft
as
early
as
january
they
formed
a
progressive
republican
league
at
the
home
of
senator
la
follette
of
wisconsin
and
launched
an
attack
on
the
taft
measures
and
policies
in
october
they
indorsed
la
follette
as
the
logical
republican
candidate
and
appealed
to
the
party
for
support
the
controversy
over
the
tariff
had
grown
into
a
formidable
revolt
against
the
occupant
of
the
white
house
in
the
after
looking
on
for
a
while
roosevelt
took
a
hand
in
the
fray
soon
after
his
return
in
from
a
hunting
trip
in
africa
and
a
tour
in
europe
he
made
a
series
of
addresses
in
which
he
formulated
a
progressive
program
in
a
speech
in
kansas
he
favored
regulation
of
the
trusts
a
graduated
income
tax
bearing
heavily
on
great
fortunes
tariff
revision
schedule
by

conservation
of

the
direct

and
the
recall
of
elective
officials
in
an
address
before
the
ohio
state
constitutional
convention
in
february
he
indorsed
the
initiative
and
referendum
and
announced
a
doctrine
known
as
the
recall
of
judicial
decisions
this
was
a
new
and
radical
note
in
american
politics
an
of
the
united
states
proposed
that
the
people
at
the
polls
should
have
the
right
to
reverse
the
decision
of
a
judge
who
set
aside
any
act
of
a
state
legislature
passed
in
the
interests
of
social
welfare
the
progressive
republicans
impressed
by
these
addresses
turned
from
la
follette
to
roosevelt
and
on
february
induced
him
to
come
out
openly
as
a
candidate
against
taft
for
the
republican
nomination
split
in
the
republican
the
country
then
witnessed
the
strange
spectacle
of
two
men
who
had
once
been
close
companions
engaged
in
a
bitter
rivalry
to
secure
a
majority
of
the
delegates
to
the
republican
convention
to
be
held
at
chicago
when
the
convention
assembled
about
of
the
seats
were
contested
the
delegates
for
both
candidates
loudly
proclaiming
the
regularity
of
their
election
in
deciding
between
the
contestants
the
national
committee
after
the
usual
hearings
settled
the
disputes
in
such
a
way
that
taft
received
a
safe
majority
after
a
week
of
negotiation
roosevelt
and
his
followers
left
the
republican
party
most
of
his
supporters
withdrew
from
the
convention
and
the
few
who
remained
behind
refused
to
answer
the
roll
call
undisturbed
by
this
formidable
bolt
the
regular
republicans
went
on
with
their
work
they
renominated
taft
and
put
forth
a
platform
roundly
condemning
such
progressive
doctrines
as
the
recall
of
judges
formation
of
the
progressive
the
action
of
the
republicans
in
seating
the
taft
delegates
was
vigorously
denounced
by
roosevelt
he
declared
that
the
convention
had
no
claim
to
represent
the
voters
of
the
republican
party
that
any
candidate
named
by
it
would
be
the
beneficiary
of
a
successful
fraud
and
that
it
would
be
deeply
discreditable
to
any
man
to
accept
the
convention
approval
under
such
circumstances
the
bitterness
of
his
followers
was
extreme
on
july
a
call
went
forth
for
a
progressive
convention
to
be
held
in
chicago
on
august
the
assembly
which
duly
met
on
that
day
was
a
unique
political
conference
prominence
was
given
to
women
delegates
and
politicians
were
notably
absent
roosevelt
himself
who
was
cheered
as
a
conquering
hero
made
an
impassioned
speech
setting
forth
his
confession
of
faith
he
was
nominated
by
acclamation
governor
hiram
johnson
of
california
was
selected
as
his
companion
candidate
for
vice
president
the
platform
endorsed
such
political
reforms
as
woman
suffrage
direct
primaries
the
initiative
referendum
and
recall
popular
election
of
united
states
senators
and
the
short
ballot
it
favored
a
program
of
social
legislation
including
the
prohibition
of
child
labor
and
minimum
wages
for
women
it
approved
the
regulation
rather
than
the
dissolution
of
the
trusts
like
apostles
in
a
new
and
lofty
cause
the
progressives
entered
a
vigorous
campaign
for
the
election
of
their
distinguished
leader
wilson
and
the
election
of
with
the
republicans
divided
victory
loomed
up
before
the
democrats
naturally
a
terrific
contest
over
the
nomination
occurred
at
their
convention
in
baltimore
champ
clark
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
governor
woodrow
wilson
of
new
jersey
were
the
chief
contestants
after
tossing
to
and
fro
for
seven
long
hot
days
and
taking
ballots
the
delegates
powerfully
influenced
by
bryan
finally
decided
in
favor
of
the
governor
as
a
professor
a
writer
on
historical
and
political
subjects
and
the
president
of
princeton
university
wilson
had
become
widely
known
in
public
life
as
the
governor
of
new
jersey
he
had
attracted
the
support
of
the
progressives
in
both
parties
with
grim
determination
he
had
waged
war
on
the
bosses
and
pushed
through
the
legislature
measures
establishing
direct
primaries

were
well
named
the
age
of
the
muckrakers
subjects
of
the
in
this
outburst
of
invective
nothing
was
spared
it
was
charged
that
each
of
the
political
parties
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
professional
politicians
who
devoted
their
time
to
managing
conventions
making
platforms
nominating
candidates
and
dictating
to
officials

some
critics
specialized

imputation

of

york
he
said
what
is
the
government
of
this
state
what
has
it
been
during
the
forty
years
of
my
acquaintance
with
it
the
government
of
the
constitution
oh
no
not
half
the
time
or
half
way
from
the
days
of
fenton
and
conkling
and
arthur
and
cornell
and
platt
from
the
days
of
david
hill
down
to
the
present
time
the
government
of
the
state
has
presented
two
different
lines
of
activity
one
of
the
constitutional
and
statutory
officers
of
the
state
and
the
other
of
the
party
leaders
they
call
them
party
bosses
they
call
the
system
i
do
coin
the
phrase
the
system
they
call
government
for
i
do
know
how
many
years
conkling
was
the
supreme
ruler
in
this
state
the
governor
did
not
count
the
legislature
did
not
count
comptrollers
and
secretaries
of
state
and
what
not
did
not
count
it
was
what
conkling
said
and
in
a
great
outburst
of
public
rage
he
was
pulled
down
then
platt
ruled
the
state
for
nigh
upon
twenty
years
he
ruled
it
it
was
not
the
governor
it
was
not
the
legislature
it
was
platt
and
the
capital
was
not
here
in
albany
it
was
at
broadway
platt
and
his
lieutenants
it
makes
no
difference
what
name
you
give
whether
you
call
it
fenton
or
conkling
or
cornell
or
arthur
or
platt
or
by
the
names
of
men
now
living
the
ruler
of
the
state
during
the
greater
part
of
the
forty
years
of
my
acquaintance
with
the
state
government
has
not
been
any
man
authorized
by
the
constitution
or
by
law
the
party
leader
is
elected
by
no
one
accountable
to
no
one
bound
by
no
oath
of
office
removable
by
no
one
nation
with
the
spirit
of
criticism
came
also
the
spirit
of
reform
the
charges
were
usually
exaggerated
often
wholly
false
but
there
was
enough
truth
in
them
to
warrant
renewed
vigilance
on
the
part
of
american
democracy
president
roosevelt
doubtless
summed
up
the
sentiment
of
the
great
majority
of
citizens
when
he
demanded
the
punishment
of
in
saying
it
makes
not
a
particle
of
difference
whether
these
crimes
are
committed
by
a
capitalist
or
by
a
laborer
by
a
leading
banker
or
manufacturer
or
railroad
man
or
by
a
leading
representative
of
a
labor
union
swindling
in
stocks
corrupting
legislatures
making
fortunes
by
the
inflation
of
securities
by
wrecking
railroads
by
destroying
competitors
through
rebates
these
forms
of
in
the
capitalist
are
far
more
infamous
than
any
ordinary
form
of
embezzlement
or
forgery
the
time
had
come
he
added
to
stop
muckraking
and
proceed
to
the
constructive
work
of
removing
the
abuses
that
had
grown
up
political
reforms
public
it
was
a
wise
comprehension
of
the
needs
of
american
democracy
that
led
the
friends
of
reform
to
launch
and
to
sustain
for
more
than
half
a
century
a
movement
to
improve
the
public
service
on
the
one
side
they
struck
at
the
spoils
system
at
the
right
of
the
politicians
to
use
public
offices
as
mere
rewards
for
partisan
work
the
federal
civil
service
act
of
opened
the
way
to
reform
by
establishing
five
vital
principles
in
law
admission
to
office
not
on
the
recommendation
of
party
workers
but
on
the
basis
of
competitive
examinations
promotion
for
meritorious
service
of
the
government
rather
than
of
parties
no
assessment
of
office
holders
for
campaign
funds
permanent
tenure
during
good
behavior
and
no
dismissals
for
political
reasons
the
act
itself
at
first
applied
to
only
federal
offices
but
under
the
constant
pressure
from
the
reformers
it
was
extended
until
in
it
covered
nearly
employees
out
of
an
executive
force
of
approximately
while
gaining
steadily
at
washington
civil
service
reformers
carried
their
agitation
into
the
states
and
cities
by
they
were
able
to
report
ten
states
with
civil
service
commissions
and
the
merit
system
well
intrenched
in
more
than
three
hundred
municipalities
in
excluding
spoilsmen
from
public
office
the
reformers
were
in
a
sense
engaged
in
a
negative
work
that
of
keeping
the
rascals
out
but
there
was
a
second
and
larger
phase
to
their
movement
one
constructive
in
character
that
of
getting
skilled
loyal
and
efficient
servants
into
the
places
of
responsibility
everywhere
on
land
and
sea
in
town
and
country
new
burdens
were
laid
upon
public
officers
they
were
called
upon
to
supervise
the
ships
sailing
to
and
from
our
ports
to
inspect
the
water
and
milk
supplies
of
our
cities
to
construct
and
operate
great
public
works
such
as
the
panama
and
erie
canals
to
regulate
the
complicated
rates
of
railway
companies
to
safeguard
health
and
safety
in
a
thousand
ways
to
climb
the
mountains
to
fight
forest
fires
and
to
descend
into
the
deeps
of
the
earth
to
combat
the
deadly
coal
gases
that
assail
the
miners
in
a
word
those
who
labored
to
master
the
secrets
and
the
powers
of
nature
were
summoned
to
the
aid
of
the
government
chemists
engineers
architects
nurses
surgeons
foresters
the
skilled
in
all
the
sciences
arts
and
crafts
keeping
rascals
out
was
no
task
at
all
compared
with
the
problem
of
finding
competent
people
for
all
the
technical
offices
now
said
the
reformers
we
must
make
attractive
careers
in
the
government
work
for
the
best
american
talent
we
must
train
those
applying
for
admission
and
increase
the
skill
of
those
already
in
positions
of
trust
we
must
see
to
it
that
those
entering
at
the
bottom
have
a
chance
to
rise
to
the
top
in
short
we
must
work
for
a
government
as
skilled
and
efficient
as
it
is
strong
one
commanding
all
the
wisdom
and
talent
of
america
that
public
welfare
requires
australian
a
second
line
of
attack
on
the
political
machines
was
made
in
connection
with
the
ballot
in
the
early
days
elections
were
frequently
held
in
the
open
air
and
the
poll
was
taken
by
a
show
of
hands
or
by
the
enrollment
of
the
voters
under
names
of
their
favorite
candidates
when
this
ancient
practice
was
abandoned
in
favor
of
the
printed
ballot
there
was
still
no
secrecy
about
elections
each
party
prepared
its
own
ballot
often
of
a
distinctive
color
containing
the
names
of
its
candidates
on
election
day
these
papers
were
handed
out
to
the
voters
by
party
workers
any
one
could
tell
from
the
color
of
the
ballot
dropped
into
the
box
or
from
some
mark
on
the
outside
of
the
folded
ballot
just
how
each
man
voted
those
who
bought
votes
were
sure
that
their
purchases
were
delivered
those
who
intimidated
voters
could
know
when
their
intimidation
was
effective
in
this
way
the
party
ballot
strengthened
the
party
machine
as
a
remedy
for
such
abuses
reformers
learning
from
the
experience
of
australia
urged
the
adoption
of
the
australian
ballot
that
ballot
though
it
appeared
in
many
forms
had
certain
constant
features
it
was
official
that
is
furnished
by
the
government
not
by
party
workers
it
contained
the
names
of
all
candidates
of
all
parties
it
was
given
out
only
in
the
polling
places
and
it
was
marked
in
secret
the
first
state
to
introduce
it
was
massachusetts
the
year
was
before
the
end
of
the
century
it
had
been
adopted
by
nearly
all
the
states
in
the
union
the
salutary
effect
of
the
reform
in
reducing
the
amount
of
cheating
and
bribery
in
elections
was
beyond
all
question
direct
in
connection
with
the
uprising
against
machine
politics
came
a
call
for
the
abolition
of
the
old
method
of
nominating
candidates
by
conventions
these
party
assemblies
which
had
come
down
from
the
days
of
andrew
jackson
were
it
was
said
merely
conclaves
of
party
workers
sustained
by
the
spoils
system
and
dominated
by
an
inner
circle
of
bosses
the
remedy
offered
in
this
case
was
again
more
democracy
namely
the
abolition
of
the
party
convention
and
the
adoption
of
the
direct
primary
candidates
were
no
longer
to
be
chosen
by
secret
conferences
any
member
of
a
party
was
to
be
allowed
to
run
for
any
office
to
present
his
name
to
his
party
by
securing
signatures
to
a
petition
and
to
submit
his
candidacy
to
his
fellow
partisans
at
a
direct
primary
an
election
within
the
party
in
this
movement
governor
la
follette
of
wisconsin
took
the
lead
and
his
state
was
the
first
in
the
union
to
adopt
the
direct
primary
for
purposes
the
idea
spread
rapidly
in
the
west
more
slowly
in
the
east
the
public
already
angered
against
the
bosses
grasped
eagerly
at
it
governor
hughes
in
new
york
pressed
it
upon
the
unwilling
legislature
state
after
state
accepted
it
until
by
rhode
island
delaware
connecticut
and
new
mexico
were
the
only
states
that
had
not
bowed
to
the
storm
still
the
results
were
disappointing
and
at
that
very
time
the
pendulum
was
beginning
to
swing
backward
election
of
federal
while
the
movement
for
direct
primaries
was
still
advancing
everywhere
a
demand
for
the
popular
election
of
senators
usually
associated
with
it
swept
forward
to
victory
under
the
original
constitution
it
had
been
expressly
provided
that
senators
should
be
chosen
by
the
legislatures
of
the
states
in
practice
this
rule
transferred
the
selection
of
senators
to
secret
caucuses
of
party
members
in
the
state
legislatures
in
connection
with
these
caucuses
there
had
been
many
scandals
some
direct
proofs
of
brazen
bribery
and
corruption
and
dark
hints
besides
the
senate
was
called
by
its
detractors
a
millionaires
club
and
it
was
looked
upon
as
the
citadel
of
conservatism
the
prescription
in
this
case
was
likewise
more
democracy
direct
election
of
senators
by
popular
vote
this
reform
was
not
a
new
idea
it
had
been
proposed
in
congress
as
early
as
president
johnson
an
ardent
advocate
made
it
the
subject
of
a
special
message
in
not
long
afterward
it
appeared
in
congress
at
last
in
the
year
after
the
great
populist
upheaval
the
house
of
representatives
by
the
requisite
vote
incorporated
it
in
an
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
again
and
again
it
passed
the
house
but
the
senate
itself
was
obdurate
able
senators
leveled
their
batteries
against
it
hoar
of
massachusetts
declared
that
it
would
transfer
the
seat
of
power
to
the
great
cities
and
masses
of
population
that
it
would
overthrow
the
whole
scheme
of
the
senate
and
in
the
end
the
whole
scheme
of
the
national
constitution
as
designed
and
established
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
and
the
people
who
adopted
it
failing
in
the
senate
advocates
of
popular
election
made
a
rear
assault
through
the
states
they
induced
state
legislatures
to
enact
laws
requiring
the
nomination
of
candidates
for
the
senate
by
the
direct
primary
and
then
they
bound
the
legislatures
to
abide
by
the
popular
choice
nevada
took
the
lead
in
shortly
afterward
oregon
by
the
use
of
the
initiative
and
referendum
practically
bound
legislators
to
accept
the
popular
nominee
and
the
country
witnessed
the
spectacle
of
a
republican
legislature
electing
a
democrat
to
represent
the
state
in
the
senate
at
washington
by
of
the
states
had
applied
the
direct
primary
in
some
form
to
the
choice
of
senators
men
selected
by
that
method
began
to
pour
in
upon
the
floors
of
congress
finally
in
the
majority
was
secured
for
an
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
providing
for
the
popular
election
of
senators
it
was
quickly
ratified
by
the
states
the
following
year
it
was
proclaimed
in
effect
initiative
and
as
a
corrective
for
the
evils
which
had
grown
up
in
state
legislatures
there
arose
a
demand
for
the
introduction
of
a
swiss
device
known
as
the
initiative
and
referendum
the
initiative
permits
any
one
to
draw
up
a
proposed
bill
and
on
securing
a
certain
number
of
signatures
among
the
voters
to
require
the
submission
of
the
measure
to
the
people
at
an
election
if
the
bill
thus
initiated
receives
a
sufficient
majority
it
becomes
a
law
the
referendum
allows
citizens
who
disapprove
any
act
passed
by
the
legislature
to
get
up
a
petition
against
it
and
thus
bring
about
a
reference
of
the
measure
to
the
voters
at
the
polls
for
approval
or
rejection
these
two
practices
constitute
a
form
of
direct
government
these
devices
were
prescribed
to
restore
the
government
to
the
people
the
populists
favored
them
in
their
platform
of
bryan
two
years
later
made
them
a
part
of
his
program
and
in
the
same
year
south
dakota
adopted
them
in
oregon
after
a
strenuous
campaign
added
a
direct
legislation
amendment
to
the
state
constitution
within
ten
years
all
the
southwestern
mountain
and
pacific
states
except
texas
and
wyoming
had
followed
this
example
to
the
east
of
the
mississippi
however
direct
legislation
met
a
chilly
reception
by
only
five
states
in
this
section
had
accepted
it
maine
massachusetts
ohio
michigan
and
maryland
the
last
approving
the
referendum
only
executive
officers
and
judges
as
well
as
legislatures
had
come
in
for
their
share
of
criticism
and
it
was
proposed
that
they
should
likewise
be
subjected
to
a
closer
scrutiny
by
the
public
for
this
purpose
there
was
advanced
a
scheme
known
as
the
recall
which
permitted
a
certain
percentage
of
the
voters
to
compel
any
officer
at
any
time
during
his
term
to
go
before
the
people
at
a
new
election
this
feature
of
direct
government
tried
out
first
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
was
extended
to
uses
in
oregon
in
it
failed
however
to
capture
popular
imagination
to
the
same
degree
as
the
initiative
and
referendum
at
the
end
of
ten
years
agitation
only
ten
states
mainly
in
the
west
had
adopted
it
for
general
purposes
and
four
of
them
did
not
apply
it
to
the
judges
of
the
courts
still
it
was
extensively
acclaimed
in
cities
and
incorporated
into
hundreds
of
municipal
laws
and
charters
as
a
general
proposition
direct
government
in
all
its
forms
was
bitterly
opposed
by
men
of
a
conservative
cast
of
mind
it
was
denounced
by
senator
henry
cabot
lodge
as
nothing
less
than
a
complete
revolution
in
the
fabric
of
our
government
and
in
the
fundamental
principles
upon
which
that
government
rests
in
his
opinion
it
promised
to
break
down
the
representative
principle
and
undermine
and
overthrow
the
bulwarks
of
ordered
liberty
and
individual
freedom
taft
shared
views
and
spoke
of
direct
government
with
scorn
votes
he
exclaimed
are
not
bread
referendums
do
not
pay
rent
or
furnish
houses
recalls
do
not
furnish
clothes
initiatives
do
not
supply
employment
or
relieve
inequalities
of
condition
or
of
opportunity
government
for
in
the
restless
searching
out
of
evils
the
management
of
cities
early
came
under
critical
scrutiny
city
government
bryce
had
remarked
was
the
one
conspicuous
failure
in
america
this
sharp
thrust
though
resented
by
some
was
accepted
as
a
warning
by
others
many
prescriptions
were
offered
by
doctors
of
the
body
politic
chief
among
them
was
the
idea
of
simplifying
the
city
government
so
that
the
light
of
public
scrutiny
could
shine
through
it
let
us
elect
only
a
few
men
and
make
them
clearly
responsible
for
the
city
government
was
the
new
cry
in
municipal
reform
so
many
city
councils
were
reduced
in
size
one
of
the
two
houses
which
several
cities
had
adopted
in
imitation
of
the
federal
government
was
abolished
and
in
order
that
the
mayor
could
be
held
to
account
he
was
given
the
power
to
appoint
all
the
chief
officials
this
made
the
mayor
in
some
cases
the
only
elective
city
official
and
gave
the
voters
a
short
ballot
containing
only
a
few
names
an
idea
which
some
proposed
to
apply
also
to
the
state
government
a
further
step
in
the
concentration
of
authority
was
taken
in
galveston
texas
where
the
people
looking
upon
the
ruin
of
their
city
wrought
by
the
devastating
storm
of
and
confronted
by
the
difficult
problems
of
reconstruction
felt
the
necessity
for
a
more
businesslike
management
of
city
affairs
and
instituted
a
new
form
of
local
administration
they
abolished
the
old
scheme
of
mayor
and
council
and
vested
all
power
in
five
commissioners
one
of
whom
without
any
special
prerogatives
was
assigned
to
the
office
of
mayor
president
in
the
commission
form
of
government
as
it
was
soon
characterized
was
adopted
by
des
moines
iowa
the
attention
of
all
municipal
reformers
was
drawn
to
it
and
it
was
hailed
as
the
guarantee
of
a
better
day
by
more
than
four
hundred
cities
including
memphis
spokane
birmingham
newark
and
buffalo
had
adopted
it
still
the
larger
cities
like
new
york
and
chicago
kept
their
boards
of
aldermen
city
manager
a
few
years
experience
with
commission
government
revealed
certain
patent
defects
the
division
of
the
work
among
five
men
was
frequently
found
to
introduce
dissensions
and
irresponsibility
commissioners
were
often
lacking
in
the
technical
ability
required
to
manage
such
difficult
matters
as
fire
and
police
protection
public
health
public
works
and
public
utilities
some
one
then
proposed
to
carry
over
into
city
government
an
idea
from
the
business
world
in
that
sphere
the
stockholders
of
each
corporation
elect
the
directors
and
the
directors
in
turn
choose
a
business
manager
to
conduct
the
affairs
of
the
company
it
was
suggested
that
the
city
commissioners
instead
of
attempting
to
supervise
the
details
of
the
city
administration
should
select
a
manager
to
do
this
the
scheme
was
put
into
effect
in
sumter
south
carolina
in
like
the
commission
plan
it
became
popular
within
eight
years
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
towns
and
cities
had
adopted
it
among
the
larger
municipalities
were
dayton
springfield
ohio
akron
kalamazoo
and
phoenix
it
promised
to
create
a
new
public
service
profession
that
of
city
manager
measures
of
economic
reform
spirit
of
american
the
purification
of
the
ballot
the
restriction
of
the
spoils
system
the
enlargement
of
direct
popular
control
over
the
organs
of
government
were
not
the
sole
answers
made
by
the
reformers
to
the
critics
of
american
institutions
nor
were
they
the
most
important
in
fact
they
were
regarded
not
as
ends
in
themselves
but
as
means
to
serve
a
wider
purpose
that
purpose
was
the
promotion
of
the
general
welfare
the
concrete
objects
covered
by
that
broad
term
were
many
and
varied
but
they
included
the
prevention
of
extortion
by
railway
and
other
corporations
the
protection
of
public
health
the
extension
of
education
the
improvement
of
living
conditions
in
the
cities
the
elimination
of
undeserved
poverty
the
removal
of
gross
inequalities
in
wealth
and
more
equality
of
opportunity
all
these
things
involved
the
use
of
the
powers
of
government
although
a
few
clung
to
the
ancient
doctrine
that
the
government
should
not
interfere
with
private
business
at
all
the
american
people
at
large
rejected
that
theory
as
vigorously
as
they
rejected
the
doctrines
of
an
extreme
socialism
which
exalts
the
state
above
the
individual
leaders
representing
every
shade
of
opinion
proclaimed
the
government
an
instrument
of
common
welfare
to
be
used
in
the
public
interest
we
must
abandon
definitely
said
roosevelt
the
theory
of
political
economy
and
fearlessly
champion
a
system
of
increased
governmental
control
paying
no
attention
to
the
cries
of
worthy
people
who
denounce
this
as
socialistic
this
view
was
shared
by
taft
who
observed
undoubtedly
the
government
can
wisely
do
much
more
to
relieve
the
oppressed
to
create
greater
equality
of
opportunity
to
make
reasonable
terms
for
labor
in
employment
and
to
furnish
vocational
education
he
was
quick
to
add
his
caution
that
there
is
a
line
beyond
which
the
government
can
not
go
with
any
good
practical
results
in
seeking
to
make
men
and
society
better
regulation
of
the
first
attempts
to
use
the
government
in
a
large
way
to
control
private
enterprise
in
the
public
interest
were
made
by
the
northwestern
states
in
the
decade
between
and
charges
were
advanced
by
the
farmers
particularly
those
organized
into
granges
that
the
railways
extorted
the
highest
possible
rates
for
freight
and
passengers
that
favoritism
was
shown
to
large
shippers
that
fraudulent
stocks
and
bonds
were
sold
to
the
innocent
public
it
was
claimed
that
railways
were
not
like
other
enterprises
but
were
concerns
like
the
roads
and
ferries
and
thus
subject
to
government
control
accordingly
laws
were
enacted
bringing
the
railroads
under
state
supervision
in
some
cases
the
state
legislature
fixed
the
maximum
rates
to
be
charged
by
common
carriers
and
in
other
cases
commissions
were
created
with
the
power
to
establish
the
rates
after
an
investigation
this
legislation
was
at
first
denounced
in
the
east
as
nothing
less
than
the
confiscation
of
the
railways
in
the
interest
of
the
farmers
attempts
to
have
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
declare
it
unconstitutional
were
made
without
avail
still
a
principle
was
finally
laid
down
to
the
effect
that
in
fixing
rates
state
legislatures
and
commissions
must
permit
railway
companies
to
earn
a
fair
return
on
the
capital
invested
in
a
few
years
the
granger
spirit
appeared
in
congress
an
investigation
revealed
a
long
list
of
abuses
committed
by
the
railways
against
shippers
and
travelers
the
result
was
the
interstate
commerce
act
of
which
created
the
interstate
commerce
commission
forbade
discriminations
in
rates
and
prohibited
other
objectionable
practices
on
the
part
of
railways
this
measure
was
loosely
enforced
and
the
abuses
against
which
it
was
directed
continued
almost
unabated
a
demand
for
stricter
control
grew
louder
and
louder
congress
was
forced
to
heed
in
it
enacted
the
elkins
law
forbidding
railways
to
charge
rates
other
than
those
published
and
laid
penalties
upon
the
officers
and
agents
of
companies
who
granted
secret
favors
to
shippers
and
upon
shippers
who
accepted
them
three
years
later
a
still
more
drastic
step
was
taken
by
the
passage
of
the
hepburn
act
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
authorized
upon
complaint
of
some
party
aggrieved
and
after
a
public
hearing
to
determine
whether
just
and
reasonable
rates
had
been
charged
by
the
companies
in
effect
the
right
to
fix
freight
and
passenger
rates
was
taken
out
of
the
hands
of
the
owners
of
the
railways
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
vested
in
the
hands
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
thus
private
property
to
the
value
of
or
more
was
declared
to
be
a
matter
of
public
concern
and
subject
to
government
regulation
in
the
common
interest
similar
problems
arose
in
connection
with
the
street
railways
electric
light
plants
and
other
utilities
in
the
great
cities
in
the
beginning
the
right
to
construct
such
undertakings
was
freely
and
often
corruptly
granted
to
private
companies
by
city
councils
distressing
abuses
arose
in
connection
with
such
practices
many
grants
or
franchises
were
made
perpetual
or
perhaps
for
a
term
of
years
the
rates
charged
and
services
rendered
were
left
largely
to
the
will
of
the
companies
holding
the
franchises
mergers
or
unions
of
companies
were
common
and
the
public
was
deluged
with
stocks
and
bonds
of
doubtful
value
bankruptcies
were
frequent
the
connection
between
the
utility
companies
and
the
politicians
was
to
say
the
least
not
always
in
the
public
interest
american
ingenuity
was
quick
to
devise
methods
for
eliminating
such
evils
three
lines
of
progress
were
laid
out
by
the
reformers
one
group
proposed
that
such
utilities
should
be
subject
to
municipal
or
state
regulation
that
the
formation
of
utility
companies
should
be
under
public
control
and
that
the
issue
of
stocks
and
bonds
must
be
approved
by
public
authority
in
some
cases
state
and
in
other
cases
municipal
commissions
were
created
to
exercise
this
great
power
over
corporations
wisconsin
by
laws
enacted
in
put
all
heat
light
water
works
telephone
and
street
railway
companies
under
the
supervision
of
a
single
railway
commission
other
states
followed
this
example
rapidly
by
the
principle
of
public
control
over
municipal
utilities
was
accepted
in
nearly
every
section
of
the
union
a
second
line
of
reform
appeared
in
the
model
franchise
for
utility
corporations
an
illustration
of
this
tendency
was
afforded
by
the
chicago
street
railway
settlement
of
the
total
capital
of
the
company
was
fixed
at
a
definite
sum
its
earnings
were
agreed
upon
and
the
city
was
given
the
right
to
buy
and
operate
the
system
if
it
desired
to
do
so
in
many
states
about
the
same
time
it
was
provided
that
no
franchises
to
utility
companies
could
run
more
than
years
a
third
group
of
reformers
were
satisfied
with
nothing
short
of
municipal
ownership
they
proposed
to
drive
private
companies
entirely
out
of
the
field
and
vest
the
ownership
and
management
of
municipal
plants
in
the
city
itself
this
idea
was
extensively
applied
to
electric
light
and
water
works
plants
but
to
street
railways
in
only
a
few
cities
including
san
francisco
and
seattle
in
new
york
the
subways
are
owned
by
the
city
but
leased
for
operation
house
among
the
other
pressing
problems
of
the
cities
was
the
overcrowding
in
houses
unfit
for
habitation
an
inquiry
in
new
york
city
made
under
the
authority
of
the
state
in
revealed
poverty
misery
slums
dirt
and
disease
almost
beyond
imagination
the
immediate
answer
was
the
enactment
of
a
tenement
house
law
prescribing
in
great
detail
the
size
of
the
rooms
the
air
space
the
light
and
the
sanitary
arrangement
for
all
new
buildings
an
immense
improvement
followed
and
the
idea
was
quickly
taken
up
in
other
states
having
large
industrial
centers
in
new
york
made
a
further
invasion
of
the
rights
of
landlords
by
assuring
to
the
public
reasonable
rents
for
flats
and
apartments
no
small
part
of
the
poverty
in
cities
was
due
to
the
injury
of
while
at
their
trade
every
year
the
number
of
men
and
women
killed
or
wounded
in
industry
mounted
higher
under
the
old
law
the
workman
or
his
family
had
to
bear
the
loss
unless
the
employer
had
been
guilty
of
some
extraordinary
negligence
even
in
that
case
an
expensive
lawsuit
was
usually
necessary
to
recover
damages
in
short
although
employers
insured
their
buildings
and
machinery
against
necessary
risks
from
fire
and
storm
they
allowed
their
employees
to
assume
the
heavy
losses
due
to
accidents
the
injustice
of
this
though
apparent
enough
now
was
once
not
generally
recognized
it
was
said
to
be
unfair
to
make
the
employer
pay
for
injuries
for
which
he
was
not
personally
responsible
but
the
argument
was
overborne
illustration
an
east
side
street
in
new
york
about
there
set
in
a
decided
movement
in
the
direction
of
lifting
the
burden
of
accidents
from
the
unfortunate
victims
in
the
first
place
laws
were
enacted
requiring
employers
to
pay
damages
in
certain
amounts
according
to
the
nature
of
the
case
no
matter
how
the
accident
occurred
as
long
as
the
injured
person
was
not
guilty
of
willful
negligence
by
more
than
the
states
had
such
laws
in
the
second
place
there
developed
schemes
of
industrial
insurance
in
the
form
of
automatic
grants
made
by
state
commissions
to
persons
injured
in
industries
the
funds
to
be
provided
by
the
employers
or
the
state
or
by
both

had
legislation
of
this
type

and

source
of
poverty
especially
among

found
to

report
after
report

this
in
massachusetts
took
a
significant
step
in
the
direction
of
declaring
the
minimum
wages
which
might
be
paid
to
women
and

oregon
the
following
year
created
a
commission
with
power
to
prescribe
minimum
wages
in
certain
industries
based
on
the
cost
of
living
and
to
enforce
the
rates
fixed
within
a
short
time
of
the
states
had
legislation
of
this
character
to
cut
away
some
of
the
evils
of
poverty
and
enable
widows
to
keep
their
homes
intact
and
bring
up
their
children
a
device
known
as
mothers
pensions
became
popular
during
the
second
decade
of
the
twentieth
century
at
the
opening
of
two
states
colorado
and
illinois
had
laws
authorizing
the
payment
from
public
funds
of
definite
sums
to
widows
with
children
within
four
years
states
had
similar
legislation
and
great
as
a
part
of
the
campaign
waged
against
poverty
by
reformers
there
came
a
demand
for
heavy
taxes
upon
great
fortunes
particularly
taxes
upon
inheritances
or
estates
passing
to
heirs
on
the
decease
of
the
owners
roosevelt
was
an
ardent
champion
of
this
type
of
taxation
and
dwelt
upon
it
at
length
in
his
message
to
congress
in
such
a
tax
he
said
would
help
to
preserve
a
measurable
equality
of
opportunity
for
the
people
of
the
generations
growing
to
manhood
our
aim
is
to
recognize
what
lincoln
pointed
out
the
fact
that
there
are
some
respects
in
which
men
are
obviously
not
equal
but
also
to
insist
that
there
should
be
equality
of
and
of
mutual
respect
an
equality
of
rights
before
the
law
and
at
least
an
approximate
equality
in
the
conditions
under
which
each
man
obtains
the
chance
to
show
the
stuff
that
is
in
him
when
compared
with
his
fellows
the
spirit
of
the
new
age
was
therefore
one
of
reform
not
of
revolution
it
called
for
no

for
the

vitally
affected

in

in

and
was
promoted
by
their
organizations
where
they
did

they
were
affiliated
with
movements
for
social
improvement
no
cause
escaped
their
attention
no
year
passed
without
widening
the
range
of
their
interests
they
served
on
committees
that
inquired
into
the
problems
of
the
day
they
appeared
before

assemblies
to
advocate

for
the

in
nine
states
complete

equal

had
been
established
and
a
widespread
campaign
for
a
national
suffrage
amendment
was
in
full
swing
on
every
hand
lay
evidences
that
their
sphere
had
been
broadened
to
include

this
was
the
culmination
of
forces
that
had
long
been
operating
new
emphasis
in
a
movement
so
deeply
affecting
important
interests
could
not
fail
to
find
a
place
in
time
in
the
written
record
of
human
progress
history
often
began
as
a
chronicle
of
kings
and
queens
knights
and
ladies
written
partly
to
amuse
and
partly
to
instruct
the
classes
that
appeared
in
its
pages
with
the
growth
of
commerce
parliaments
and
international
relations
politics
and
diplomacy
were
added
to
such
chronicles
of
royal
and
princely
doings
after
the
rise
of
democracy
industry
and
organized
labor
the
transactions
of
everyday
life
were
deemed
worthy
of
a
place
in
the
pages
of
history
in
each
case
history
was
rewritten
and
the
past
rediscovered
in
the
light
of
the
new
age
so
it
will
be
with
the
rise
and
growth
of
women
political
power
the
history
of
their
labor
their
education
their
status
in
society
their
influence
on
the
course
of
events
will
be
explored
and
given
its
place
in
the
general
record
it
will
be
a
history
of
change
the
superior
position
which
women
enjoy
in
america
is
the
result
of
a
slow
evolution
from
an
almost
rightless
condition
in
colonial
times
the
founders
of
america
brought
with
them
the
english
common
law
under
that
law
a
married
personal
property
jewels
money
furniture
and
the
like
became
her
husband
property
the
management
of
her
lands
passed
into
his
control
even
the
wages
she
earned
if
she
worked
for
some
one
else
belonged
to
him
custom
if
not
law
prescribed
that
women
should
not
take
part
in
town
meetings
or
enter
into
public
discussions
of
religious
questions
indeed
it
is
a
far
cry
from
the
banishment
of
anne
hutchinson
from
massachusetts
in
for
daring
to
dispute
with
the
church
fathers
to
the
political
conventions
of
in
which
women
sat
as
delegates
made
nominating
speeches
and
served
on
committees
in
the
contrast
between
these
two
scenes
may
be
measured
the
change
in
the
privileges
of
women
since
the
landing
of
the
pilgrims
the
account
of
this
progress
is
a
narrative
of
individual
effort
on
the
part
of
women
of
organizations
among
them
of
generous
aid
from
sympathetic
men
in
the
long
agitation
for
the
removal
of
civil
and
political
disabilities
it
is
in
part
also
a
narrative
of
irresistible
economic
change
which
drew
women
into
industry
created
a
leisure
class
gave
women
wages
and
incomes
and
therewith
economic
independence
the
rise
of
the
woman
movement
of
colonial
the
republican
spirit
which
produced
american
independence
was
of
slow
and
steady
growth
it
did
not
spring
up
in
a
single
night
it
was
on
the
contrary
nourished
during
a
long
period
of
time
by
fireside
discussions
as
well
as
by
debates
in
the
public
forum
women
shared
that
fireside
sifting
of
political
principles
and
passed
on
the
findings
of
that
scrutiny
in
letters
to
their
friends
newspaper
articles
and
every
form
of
written
word
how
widespread
was
this
potent
though
not
spectacular
force
is
revealed
in
the
collections
of
women
letters
articles
songs
dramas
and
satirical
skits
on
english
rule
that
have
come
down
to
us
in
this
search
into
the
reasons
of
government
some
women
began
to
take
thought
about
laws
that
excluded
them
from
the
ballot
two
women
at
least
left
their
protests
on
record
abigail
the
ingenious
and
witty
wife
of
john
adams
wrote
to
her
husband
in
march
that
women
objected
to
all
arbitrary
power
whether
of
state
or
males

demanded
political
privileges

women
naturally
became
deeply
interested
in
all
the
controversies
going
on
around
them
the
temperance
question
made
a
special
appeal
to
them
and
they
organized
to
demand
the

to
be
heard

to
ask
that

much
to
the
horror
of
the

promptly
excluded

ground
that
it
was
not
fitting
for
women
to
take

in

steadily
enlarged
their

here
they
encountered
difficulties
the
appearance

naturally
it
was
widely
resented

although
she
had
credentials
as

was
driven
off

simply
because

but
he
added
on
second
thought
that
he
might
consider
an
article
in
prose
nathaniel
hawthorne
another
editor
even
objected
to
something
in

because
to
him
all
women
were
equally
detestable
to
the
natural
resentment
against
their
intrusion
into
new
fields
was
added
that
aroused
by
their
ideas
and
methods
as
temperance
reformers
they
criticized
in
a
caustic
manner
those
who
would
not
accept
their
opinions
as
opponents
of

they
were
especially
bitter
one
of

held
at
philadelphia
in
passed
a
resolution
calling
on
all
women
to
leave
those
churches
that
would
not
condemn
every
form
of
human
bondage
this
stirred
against
them
many
of
the
clergy
who
accustomed
to
having
women
sit
silent
during
services
were
in
no
mood
to
treat
such
a
revolt
leniently
then
came
the
last
straw
women
decided
that
they
would
preach
out
of
the
pulpit
first
and
finally
in
it
in
the
period
of
this
ferment
was
also
the
age
of
the
industrial
revolution
in
america
the
rise
of
the
factory
system
and
the
growth
of
mill
towns
the
labor
of
women
was
transferred
from
the
homes
to
the
factories
then
arose
many
questions
the
hours
of
labor
the
sanitary
conditions
of
the
mills
the
pressure
of
foreign
immigration
on
native
labor
the
wages
of
women
as
compared
with
those
of
men
and
the
right
of
married
women
to
their
own
earnings
labor
organizations
sprang
up
among
working
women
the
mill
girls
of
lowell
massachusetts
mainly
the
daughters
of
new
england
farmers
published
a
magazine
the
lowell
offering
so
excellent
were
their
writings
that
the
french
statesman
thiers
carried
a
copy
of
their
paper
into
the
chamber
of
deputies
to
show
what
working
women
could
achieve
in
a
republic
as
women
were
now
admittedly
earning
their
own
way
in
the
world
by
their
own
labor
they
began
to
talk
of
their
economic
independence
world
shaken
by
such
was
the
quickening
of
minds
in
when
the
world
was
startled
once
more
by
a
revolution
in
france
which
spread
to
germany
poland
austria
hungary
and
italy
once
more
the
people
of
the
earth
began
to
explore
the
principles
of
democracy
and
expound
human
rights
women
now
better
educated
and
more
advanced
in
their
ideas
played
a
rôle
of
still
greater
importance
in
that
revolution
they
led
in
agitations
and
uprisings
they
suffered
from
reaction
and
persecution
from
their
prison
in
france
two
of
them
who
had
been
jailed
for
too
much
insistence
on
women
rights
exchanged
greetings
with
american
women
who
were
raising
the
same
issue
here
by
this
time
the
women
had
more
supporters
among
the
men

he
afterwards

convention
of
the
forces
moral
and
intellectual
which
had
been
stirring
among
women
crystallized
a
few
months
after
the
outbreak
of
the
european
revolution
in
the
first
woman
rights
convention
in
the
history
of

three
of

quakers
accustomed
to
take
part
in
church
meetings
with
men
the
quakers
naturally
suggested
that
men
as
well
as
women
be
invited
to
attend
the
convention
indeed
a
man
presided
over
the
conference
for
that
position
seemed
too
presumptuous
even
for
such
stout
advocates
of
woman
rights
the
deliberations
of
the
seneca
falls
convention
resulted
in
a
declaration
of
rights
modeled
after
the
declaration
of
independence
for
example
the
preamble
began
when
in
the
course
of
human
events
it
becomes
necessary
for
one
portion
of
the
family
of
man
to
assume
among
the
people
of
the

a
position
different
from
that
which
they
have
hitherto
occupied
so
also
it
closed
such
has
been
the
patient
suffering
of
women
under
this
government
and
such
is
now
the
necessity
which
constrains
them
to
demand
the
equal
station
to
which
they
are
entitled
then
followed
the
list
of
grievances
the
same
number
which
had
been
exhibited
to
george
iii
in
especially
did
they
assail
the
disabilities
imposed
upon
them
by
the
english
common
law
imported
into
america
the
law
which
denied
married
women
their
property
their
wages
and
their
legal
existence
as
separate
persons
all
these
grievances
they
recited
to
a
candid
world
the
remedies
for
the
evils
which
they
endured
were
then
set
forth
in
detail
they
demanded
equal
rights
in
the
colleges
trades
and
professions
equal
suffrage
the
right
to
share
in
all
political
offices
honors
and
emoluments
the
right
to
complete
equality
in
marriage
including
equal
guardianship
of
the
children
and
for
married
women
the
right
to
own
property
to
keep
wages
to
make
contracts
to
transact
business
and
to
testify
in
the
courts
of
justice
in
short
they
declared
women
to
be
persons
as
men
are
persons
and
entitled
to
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
human
beings
such
was
the
clarion
call
which
went
forth
to
the
world
in
to
an
amused
and
contemptuous
world
it
must
be
admitted
but
to
a
world
fated
to
heed
and
obey
first
gains
in
civil
the
convention
of
did
not
make
political
enfranchisement
the
leading
issue
rather
did
it
emphasize
the
civil
disabilities
of
women
which
were
most
seriously
under
discussion
at
the
time
indeed
the
new
york
legislature
of
that
very
year
as
the
result
of
a
twelve
years
agitation
passed
the
married
woman
property
act
setting
aside
the
general
principles
of
the
english
common
law
as
applied
to
women
and
giving
them
many
of
the
rights
of
man
california
and
wisconsin
followed
in
massachusetts
in
and
kansas
in
other
states
soon
fell
into
line
women
earnings
and
inheritances
were
at
last
their
own
in
some
states
at
least
in
a
little
while
laws
were
passed
granting
women
rights
as
equal
guardians
of
their
children
and
permitting
them
to
divorce
their
husbands
on
the
grounds
of
cruelty
and
drunkenness
by
degrees
other
steps
were
taken
the
woman
medical
college
of
pennsylvania
was
founded
in
and
the
philadelphia
school
of
design
for
women
three
years
later
in
the
american
women
educational
association
was
formed
to
initiate
an
agitation
for
enlarged
educational
opportunities
for
women
other
colleges
soon
emulated
the
example
of
oberlin
the
university
of
utah
in
hillsdale
college
in
michigan
in
baker
university
in
kansas
in
and
the
university
of
iowa
in
new
trades
and
professions
were
opened
to
women
and
old
prejudices
against
their
activities
and
demands
slowly
gave
way
the
national
struggle
for
woman
suffrage
beginnings
of
as
women
surmounted
one
obstacle
after
another
the
agitation
for
equal
suffrage
came
to
the
front
if
any
year
is
to
be
fixed
as
the
date
of
its
beginning
it
may
very
well
be
when
the
suffragists
of
ohio
urged
the
state
constitutional
convention
to
confer
the
vote
upon
them
with
apparent
spontaneity
there
were
held
in
the
same
year
state
suffrage
conferences
in
indiana
pennsylvania
and
massachusetts
and
connections
were
formed
among
the
leaders
of
these
meetings
at
the
same
time
the
first
national
suffrage
convention
was
held
in
worcester
massachusetts
on
the
call
of
leading
men
and
women
representing
six
states
accounts
of
the
convention
were
widely
circulated
in
this
country
and
abroad
english
women
for
instance
harriet
martineau
sent
words
of
appreciation
for
the
work
thus
inaugurated
it
inspired
a
leading
article
in
the
westminster
review
which
deeply
interested
the
distinguished
economist
john
stuart
mill
soon
he
was
the
champion
of
woman
suffrage
in
the
british
parliament
and
the
author
of
a
powerful
tract
subjection
of
widely
read
throughout
the
world
thus
do
world
movements
grow
strange
to
relate
the
women
of
england
were
enfranchised
before
the
adoption
of
the
federal
suffrage
amendment
in
america
the
national
suffrage
convention
of
was
followed
by
an
extraordinary
outburst
of
agitation
pamphlets
streamed
from
the
press
petitions
to
legislative
bodies
were
drafted
signed
and
presented
there
were
addresses
by
favorite
orators
like
garrison
phillips
and
curtis
and
lectures
and
poems
by
men
like
emerson
longfellow
and
whittier
in
the
first
suffrage
paper
was
founded
by
the
wife
of
a
member
of
congress
from
rhode
island
by
this
time
the
last
barrier
to
white
manhood
suffrage
in
the
north
had
been
swept
away
and
the
movement
was
gaining
momentum
every
year
suffrage
movement
checked
by
the
civil
advocates
of
woman
suffrage
believed
themselves
on
the
high
road
to
success
when
the
civil
war
engaged
the
energies
and
labors
of
the
nation
northern
women
became
absorbed
in
the
struggle
to
preserve
the
union
they
held
no
suffrage
conventions
for
five
years
they
transformed
their
associations
into
loyalty
leagues
they
banded
together
to
buy
only
domestic
goods
when
foreign
imports
threatened
to
ruin
american
markets
they
rolled
up
monster
petitions
in
favor
of
the
emancipation
of
slaves
in
hospitals
in
military
prisons
in
agriculture
and
in
industry
they
bore
their
full
share
of
responsibility
even
when
the
new
york
legislature
took
advantage
of
their
unguarded
moments
and
repealed
the
law
giving
the
mother
equal
rights
with
the
father
in
the
guardianship
of
children
they
refused
to
lay
aside
war
work
for
agitation
as
in
all
other
wars
their
devotion
was
unstinted
and
their
sacrifices
equal
to
the
necessities
of
the
hour
federal
suffrage
their
plans
and
activities
when
the
war
closed
were
shaped
by
events
beyond
their
control
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
and
their
proposed
enfranchisement
made
prominent
the
question
of
a
national
suffrage
for
the
first
time
in
our
history
friends
of
the
colored
man
insisted
that
his
civil
liberties
would
not
be
safe
unless
he
was
granted
the
right
to
vote
the
woman
suffragists
very
pertinently
asked
why
the
same
principle
did
not
apply
to
women
the
answer
which
they
received
was
negative
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
adopted
in
definitely
put
women
aside
by
limiting
the
scope
of
its
application
so
far
as
the
suffrage
was
concerned
to
the
male
sex
in
making
manhood
suffrage
national
however
it
nationalized
the
issue
this
was
the
signal
for
the
advocates
of
woman
suffrage
in
march
their
proposed
amendment
was
introduced
in
congress
by
george
julian
of
indiana
it
provided
that
no
citizen
should
be
deprived
of
the
vote
on
account
of
sex
following
the
language
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
which
forbade
disfranchisement
on
account
of
race
support
for
the
amendment
coming
from
many
directions
led
the
suffragists
to
believe
that
their
case
was
hopeful
in
their
platform
of
for
example
the
republicans
praised
the
women
for
their
loyal
devotion
to
freedom
welcomed
them
to
spheres
of
wider
usefulness
and
declared
that
the
demand
of
any
class
of
citizens
for
additional
rights
deserved
respectful
consideration
illustration

underwood
and
underwood
susan
anthony
experience
soon
demonstrated
however
that
praise
was
not
the
ballot
indeed
the
suffragists
already
had
realized
that
a
tedious
contest
lay
before
them
they
had
revived
in
their
regular
national
convention
they
gave
the
name
of
the
revolution
to
their
paper
edited
by
elizabeth
cady
stanton
and
susan
anthony
they
formed
a
national
suffrage
association
and
organized
annual
pilgrimages
to
congress
to
present
their
claims
such
activities
bore
some
results
many
eminent
congressmen
were
converted
to
their
cause
and
presented
it
ably
to
their
colleagues
of
both
chambers
still
the
subject
was
ridiculed
by
the
newspapers
and
looked
upon
as
freakish
by
the
masses
state
discouraged
by
the
outcome
of
the
national
campaign
suffragists
turned
to
the
voters
of
the
individual
states
and
sought
the
ballot
at
their
hands
gains
by
this
process
were
painfully
slow
wyoming
it
is
true
while
still
a
territory
granted
suffrage
to
women
in
and
continued
it
on
becoming
a
state
twenty
years
later
in
spite
of
strong
protests
in
congress
in
colorado
established
complete
political
equality
in
utah
the
third
suffrage
state
the
cause
suffered
many
vicissitudes
women
were
enfranchised
by
the
territorial
legislature
they
were
deprived
of
the
ballot
by
congress
in
finally
in
on
the
admission
of
utah
to
the
union
they
recovered
their
former
rights
during
the
same
year
idaho
conferred
equal
suffrage
upon
the
women
this
was
the
last
suffrage
victory
for
more
than
a
decade
suffrage
cause
in
in
the
midst
of
the
meager
gains
among
the
states
there
were
occasional
flurries
of
hope
for
immediate
action
on
the
federal
amendment
between
and
the
senate
committee
reported
the
suffrage
resolution
by
a
favorable
majority
on
five
different
occasions
during
the
same
period
however
there
were
nine
unfavorable
reports
and
only
once
did
the
subject
reach
the
point
of
a
general
debate
at
no
time
could
anything
like
the
required
vote
be
obtained
changing
status
of
while
the
suffrage
movement
was
lagging
the
activities
of

in
other
directions
were
steadily

other

especially
the
state
universities
of
the
west
opened
their
doors
to
women
and
women
were
received
into
the
professions
of
law
and
medicine
by
the
rapid
growth
of
public
high
schools
in
which
girls
enjoyed
the
same
rights
as
boys
education
was
extended
still
more
widely
the
number
of
women
teachers
increased
by
leaps
and
bounds
meanwhile
women
were
entering
nearly
every
branch
of
industry
and
business
how
many
of
them
worked
at
gainful
occupations
before
we
do
not
know
but
from
that
year
forward
we
have
the
records
of
the
census
between
and
the
proportion
of
women
in
the
professions
rose
from
less
than
two
per
cent
to
more
than
ten
per
cent
in
trade
and
transportation
from
per

to
per
cent
and
in
manufacturing
from
to
per
cent
in
there
were
over
women
gainfully
employed
as
compared
with
men
when
during
the
war
on
germany
the
government
established
the
principle
of
equal
pay
for
equal
work
and
gave
official
recognition
to
the
value
of
their
services
in
industry
it
was
discovered
how
far
women
had
traveled
along
the
road
forecast
by
the
leaders
of
club
movement
among
all
over
the
country
women
societies
and
clubs
were
started
to
advance
this
or
that
reform
or
merely
to
study
literature
art
and
science
in
time
these
women
organizations
of
all
kinds
were
federated
into
city
state
and
national
associations
and
drawn
into
the
consideration
of
public
questions
under
the
leadership
of
frances
willard
they
made
temperance
reform
a
vital
issue
they
took
an
interest
in
legislation
pertaining
to
prisons
pure
food
public
health
and
municipal
government
among
other
things
at
their
sessions
and
conferences
local
state
and
national
issues
were
discussed
until
finally
it
seems
everything
led
to
the
quest
of
the
franchise
by
solemn
resolution
in
the
national
federation
of
women
clubs
representing
nearly
two
million

formally
endorsed
woman

in
the

its

time
had
arrived
for

new
movement
a
number
of
younger
suffragists
sought
to
use
the
votes
of
women
in
the
equal
suffrage
states
to
compel
one
or
both
of
the
national
political
parties
to
endorse
and
carry
through

the
federal

then
came
upon
congress
from
every
direction
from
the
suffragists
who
made
a
straight
appeal
on
the
grounds
of
justice
and
from
the
suffragists
who
besought
the
women
of
the
west
to
vote
against
candidates
for

would
not
approve

services
of
any
particular
miner
the
miner
on
the
other
hand
however
expert
could
not
dispense
with
the
companies
he
needed
a
job
his
wife
and
children
would
starve
if
he
did
not
get
one
individually
the
miners
were
impotent
when
they
sought
to
enter
a
wage
contract
with
the
great
companies
they
could
make
fair
terms
only
by
uniting
into
trade
unions
to
bargain
collectively
it
was
of
this
state
of
affairs
that
president
taft
spoke
when
he
favored
the
modification
of
the
common
law
so
as
to
put
employees
of
little
power
and
means
on
a
level
with
their
employers
in
adjusting
and
agreeing
upon
their
mutual
obligations
john
rockefeller
on
the
side
of
the
great
captains
of
industry
recognized
the
same
facts
he
said
in
the
early
days
of
the
development
of
industry
the
employer
and
capital
investor
were
frequently
one
daily
contact
was
had
between
him
and
his
employees
who
were
his
friends
and
neighbors
because
of
the
proportions
which
modern
industry
has
attained
employers
and
employees
are
too
often
strangers
to
each
other
personal
relations
can
be
revived
only
through
adequate
representation
of
the
employees
representation
is
a
principle
which
is
fundamentally
just
and
vital
to
the
successful
conduct
of
industry
it
is
not
consistent
for
us
as
americans
to
demand
democracy
in
government
and
practice
autocracy
in
industry
with
the
developments
what
they
are
in
industry
there
is
sure
to
come
a
progressive
evolution
from
aristocratic
single
control
whether
by
capital
labor
or
the
state
to
democratic
coöperative
control
by
all
three
coöperation
between
employers
and
employees
the
changed
economic
life
described
by
the
three
eminent
men
just
quoted
was
acknowledged
by
several
great
companies
and
business
concerns
all
over
the
country
decided
efforts
were
made
to
bridge
the
gulf
which
industry
and
the
corporation
had
created
among
the
devices
adopted
was
that
of
the
company
union
in
one
of
the
western
lumber
mills
for
example
all
the
employees
were
invited
to
join
a
company
organization
they
held
monthly
meetings
to
discuss
matters
of
common
concern
they
elected
a
shop
committee
to
confer
with
the
representatives
of
the
company
and
periodically
the
agents
of
the
employers
attended
the
conferences
of
the
men
to
talk
over
matters
of
mutual
interest
the
function
of
the
shop
committee
was
to
consider
wages
hours
safety
rules
sanitation
recreation
and
other
problems
whenever
any
employee
had
a
grievance
he
took
it
up
with
the
foreman
and
if
it
was
not
settled
to
his
satisfaction
he
brought
it
before
the
shop
committee
if
the
members
of
the
shop
committee
decided
in
favor
of
the
man
with
a
grievance
they
attempted
to
settle
the
matter
with
the
company
agents
all
these
things
failing
the
dispute
was
transferred
to
a
grand
meeting
of
all
the
employees
with
the
representatives
in
common
council
a
deadlock
if
it
ensued
from
such
a
conference
was
broken
by
calling
in
impartial
arbitrators
selected
by
both
sides
from
among
citizens
outside
the
mill
thus
the
employees
were
given
a
voice
in
all
decisions
affecting
their
work
and
welfare
rights
and
grievances
were
treated
as
matters
of
mutual
interest
rather
than
individual
concern
representatives
of
trade
unions
from
outside
however
were
rigidly
excluded
from
all
negotiations
between
employers
and
the
employees
another
proposal
for
drawing
capital
and
labor
together
was
to
supplement
the
wage
system
by
other
ties
sometimes
lump
sums
were
paid
to
employees
who
remained
in
a
company
service
for
a
definite
period
of
years
again
they
were
given
a
certain
percentage
of
the
annual
profits
in
other
instances
employees
were
allowed
to
buy
stock
on
easy
terms
and
thus
become
part
owners
in
the
concern
this
last
plan
was
carried
so
far
by
a
large
soap
manufacturing
company
that
the
employees
besides
becoming
stockholders
secured
the
right
to
elect
representatives
to
serve
on
the
board
of
directors
who
managed
the
entire
business
so
extensive
had
become
by
that
the
federal
industrial
relations
committee
appointed
by
the
president
deemed
it
worthy
of
a
special
study
though
opposed
by
regular
trade
unions
it
was
undoubtedly
growing
in
popularity
managers
and
welfare
another
effort
of
employers
to
meet
the
problems
of
the
new
age
appeared
in
the
appointment
of
specialists
known
as
employment
managers
whose
task
it
was
to
study
the
relations
existing
between
masters
and
workers
and
discover
practical
methods
for
dealing
with
each
grievance
as
it
arose
by
hundreds
of
big
companies
had
recognized
this
modern
profession
and
universities
were
giving
courses
of
instruction
on
the
subject
to
young
men
and
women
in
that
year
a
national
conference
of
employment
managers
was
held
at
rochester
new
york
the
discussion
revealed
a
wide
range
of
duties
assigned
to
managers
including
questions
of
wages
hours
sanitation
rest
rooms
recreational
facilities
and
welfare
work
of
every
kind
designed
to
make
the
conditions
in
mills
and
factories
safer
and
more
humane
thus
it
was
evident
that
hundreds
of
employers
had
abandoned
the
old
idea
that
they
were
dealing
merely
with
individual
employees
and
that
their
obligations
ended
with
the
payment
of
any
wages
they
saw
fit
to
fix
in
short
they
were
seeking
to
develop
a
spirit
of
coöperation
to
take
the
place
of
competition
and
enmity
and
to
increase
the
production
of
commodities
by
promoting
the
efficiency
and
happiness
of
the
producers
the
rise
and
growth
of
organized
labor
american
federation
of
meanwhile
a
powerful
association
of
workers
representing
all
the
leading
trades
and
crafts
organized
into
unions
of
their
own
had
been
built
up
outside
the
control
of
employers
this
was
the
american
federation
of
labor
a
union
of
unions
founded
in
on
the
basis
of
beginnings
made
five
years
before
at
the
time
of
its
establishment
it
had
approximately
members
its
growth
up
to
the
end
of
the
century
was
slow
for
the
total
enrollment
in
was
only
at
that
point
the
increase
became
marked
the
membership
reached
in
and
more
than
in
to
be
counted
in
the
ranks
of
organized
labor
were
several
strong
unions
friendly
to
the
federation
though
not
affiliated
with
it
such
for
example
were
the
railway
brotherhoods
with
more
than
half
a
million
members
by
the
opening
of
the
total
strength
of
organized
labor
was
put
at
about
members
meaning
if
we
include
their
families
that
nearly
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
were
in
some
positive
way
dependent
upon
the
operations
of
trade
unions
this
was
the
culmination
of
a
long
and
significant
history
before
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
skilled
workmen
printers
shoemakers
tailors
and
carpenters
had
as
we
have
seen
formed
local
unions
in
the
large
cities
between
and
several
aggressive
steps
were
taken
in
the
american
labor
movement
for
one
thing
the
number
of
local
unions
increased
by
leaps
and
bounds
in
all
the
industrial
towns
for
another
there
was
established
in
every
large
manufacturing
city
a
central
labor
body
composed
of
delegates
from
the
unions
of
the
separate
trades
in
the
local
union
the
printers
or
the
cordwainers
for
example
considered
only
their
special
trade
problems
in
the
central
labor
union
printers
cordwainers
iron
molders
and
other
craftsmen
considered
common
problems
and
learned
to
coöperate
with
one
another
in
enforcing
the
demands
of
each
craft
a
third
step
was
the
federation
of
the
unions
of
the
same
craftsmen
in
different
cities
the
printers
of
new
york
philadelphia
boston
and
other
towns
for
instance
drew
together
and
formed
a
national
trade
union
of
printers
built
upon
the
local
unions
of
that
craft
by
the
eve
of
the
civil
war
there
were
four
or
five
powerful
national
unions
of
this
character
the
expansion
of
the
railway
made
travel
and
correspondence
easier
and
national
conventions
possible
even
for
workmen
of
small
means
about
an
attempt
was
made
to
federate
the
unions
of
all
the
different
crafts
into
a
national
organization
but
the
effort
was
premature
national
labor
the
plan
which
failed
in
was
tried
again
in
the
sixties
during
the
war
industries
and
railways
had
flourished
as
never
before
prices
had
risen
rapidly
the
demand
for
labor
had
increased
wages
had
mounted
slowly
but
steadily
hundreds
of
new
local
unions
had
been
founded
and
eight
or
ten
national
trade
unions
had
sprung
into
being
the
time
was
ripe
it
seemed
for
a
national
consolidation
of
all
labor
forces
and
in
the
year
after
the
surrender
of
general
lee
at
appomattox
the
national
labor
union
was
formed
at
baltimore
under
the
leadership
of
an
experienced
organizer
sylvis
of
the
iron
molders
the
purpose
of
the
national
labor
union
was
not
merely
to
secure
labor
standard
demands
touching
hours
wages
and
conditions
of
work
or
to
maintain
the
gains
already
won
it
leaned
toward
political
action
and
radical
opinions
above
all
it
sought
to
eliminate
the
conflict
between
capital
and
labor
by
making
workingmen
the
owners
of
shops
through
the
formation
of
coöperative
industries
for
six
years
the
national
labor
union
continued
to
hold
conferences
and
carry
on
its
propaganda
but
most
of
the
coöperative
enterprises
failed
political
dissensions
arose
and
by
the
experiment
had
come
to
an
end
knights
of
while
the
national
labor
union
was
experimenting
there
grew
up
in
the
industrial
world
a
more
radical
organization
known
as
the
noble
order
of
the
knights
of
labor
it
was
founded
in
philadelphia
in
first
as
a
secret
society
with
rituals
signs
and
pass
words
so
that
no
spy
of
the
boss
can
find
his
way
into
the
lodge
room
to
betray
his
fellows
as
the
knights
put
it
in
form
the
new
organization
was
simple
it
sought
to
bring
all
laborers
skilled
and
unskilled
men
and
women
white
and
colored
into
a
mighty
body
of
local
and
national
unions
without
distinction
of
trade
or
craft
by
ten
years
after
the
national
organization
was
established
it
boasted
a
membership
of
over
in
philosophy
the
knights
of
labor
were
socialistic
for
they
advocated
public
ownership
of
the
railways
and
other
utilities
and
the
formation
of
coöperative
societies
to
own
and
manage
stores
and
factories
as
the
knights
were
radical
in
spirit
and
their
strikes
numerous
and
prolonged
were
often
accompanied
by
violence
the
organization
alarmed
employers
and
the
general
public
raising
up
against
itself
a
vigorous
opposition
weaknesses
within
as
well
as
foes
from
without
started
the
knights
on
the
path
to
dissolution
they
waged
more
strikes
than
they
could
carry
on
successfully
their
coöperative
experiments
failed
as
those
of
other
labor
groups
before
them
had
failed
and
the
rank
and
file
could
not
be
kept
in
line
the
majority
of
the
members
wanted
immediate
gains
in
wages
or
the
reduction
of
hours
when
their
hopes
were
not
realized
they
drifted
away
from
the
order
the
troubles
were
increased
by
the
appearance
of
the
american
federation
of
labor
a
still
mightier
organization
composed
mainly
of
skilled
workers
who
held
strategic
positions
in
industry
when
they
failed
to
secure
the
effective
support
of
the
federation
in
their
efforts
to
organize
the
unskilled
the
employers
closed
in
upon
them
then
the
knights
declined
rapidly
in
power
by
they
were
a
negligible
factor
and
in
a
short
time
they
passed
into
the
limbo
of
dead
experiments
policies
of
the
american
unlike
the
knights
of
labor
the
american
federation
of
labor
sought
first
of
all
to
be
very
practical
in
its
objects
and
methods
it
avoided
all
kinds
of
socialistic
theories
and
attended
strictly
to
the
business
of
organizing
unions
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
wages
shortening
hours
and
improving
working
conditions
for
its
members
it
did
not
try
to
include
everybody
in
one
big
union
but
brought
together
the
employees
of
each
particular
craft
whose
interests
were
clearly
the
same
to
prepare
for
strikes
and
periods
of
unemployment
it
raised
large
funds
by
imposing
heavy
dues
and
created
a
benefit
system
to
hold
men
loyally
to
the
union
in
order
to
permit
action
on
a
national
scale
it
gave
the
superior
officers
extensive
powers
over
local
unions
while
declaring
that
employers
and
employees
had
much
in
common
the
federation
strongly
opposed
company
unions
employers
it
argued
were
affiliated
with
the
national
manufacturers
association
or
with
similar
employers
organizations
every
important
industry
was
now
national
in
scope
and
wages
and
hours
in
view
of
competition
with
other
shops
could
not
be
determined
in
a
single
factory
no
matter
how
amicable
might
be
the
relations
of
the
company
and
its
workers
in
that
particular
plant
for
these
reasons
the
federation
declared
company
unions
and
local
shop
committees
inherently
weak
it
insisted
that
hours
wages
and
other
labor
standards
should
be
fixed
by
general
trade
agreements
applicable
to
all
the
plants
of
a
given
industry
even
if
subject
to
local
modifications
at
the
same
time
the
federation
far
from
deliberately
antagonizing
employers
sought
to
enlist
their
coöperation
and
support
it
affiliated
with
the
national
civic
federation
an
association
of
business
men
financiers
and
professional
men
founded
in
to
promote
friendly
relations
in
the
industrial
world
in
brief
the
american
federation
of
labor
accepted
the
modern
industrial
system
and
by
organization
within
it
endeavored
to
secure
certain
definite
terms
and
conditions
for
trade
unionists
the
wider
relations
of
organized
labor
the
trade
unionism
pure
and
simple
espoused
by
the
american
federation
of
labor
seemed
to
involve
at
first
glance
nothing
but
businesslike
negotiations
with
employers
in
practice
it
did
not
work
out
that
way
the
federation
was
only
six
years
old
when
a
new
organization
appealing
directly
for
the
labor
vote
namely
the
socialist
labor
party
nominated
a
candidate
for
president
launched
into
a
national
campaign
and
called
upon
trade
unionists
to
desert
the
older
parties
and
enter
its
fold
the
socialistic
idea
introduced
into
national
politics
in
had
been
long
in
germination
before
the
civil
war
a
number
of
reformers
including
nathaniel
hawthorne
horace
greeley
and
wendell
phillips
deeply
moved
by
the
poverty
of
the
great
industrial
cities
had
earnestly
sought
relief
in
the
establishment
of
coöperative
or
communistic
colonies
they
believed
that
people
should
go
into
the
country
secure
land
and
tools
own
them
in
common
so
that
no
one
could
profit
from
exclusive
ownership
and
produce
by
common
labor
the
food
and
clothing
necessary
for
their
support
for
a
time
this
movement
attracted
wide
interest
but
it
had
little
vitality
nearly
all
the
colonies
failed
selfishness
and
indolence
usually
disrupted
the
best
of
them
in
the
course
of
time
this
utopian
idea
was
abandoned
and
another
set
of
socialist
doctrines
claiming
to
be
more
scientific
appeared
instead
the
new
school
of
socialists
adopting
the
principles
of
a
german
writer
and
agitator
karl
marx
appealed
directly
to
workingmen
it
urged
them
to
unite
against
the
capitalists
to
get
possession
of
the
machinery
of
government
and
to
introduce
collective
or
public
ownership
of
railways
land
mines
mills
and
other
means
of
production
the
marxian
socialists
therefore
became
political
they
sought
to
organize
labor
and
to
win
elections
like
the
other
parties
they
put
forward
candidates
and
platforms
the
socialist
labor
party
in
for
example
declared
in
favor
of
government
ownership
of
utilities
free
school
books
woman
suffrage
heavy
income
taxes
and
the
referendum
the
socialist
party
founded
in
with
eugene
debs
the
leader
of
the
pullman
strike
as
its
candidate
called
for
public
ownership
of
all
trusts
monopolies
mines
railways
and
the
chief
means
of
production
in
the
course
of
time
the
vote
of
the
latter
organization
rose
to
considerable
proportions
reaching
almost
a
million
in
it
declined
four
years
later
and
then
rose
in
to
about
the
same
figure
in
their
appeal
for
votes
the
socialists
of
every
type
turned
first
to
labor
at
the
annual
conventions
of
the
american
federation
of
labor
they
besought
the
delegates
to
endorse
socialism
the
president
of
the
federation
samuel
gompers
on
each
occasion
took
the
floor
against
them
he
repudiated
socialism
and
the
socialists
on
both
theoretical
and
practical
grounds
he
opposed
too
much
public
ownership
declaring
that
the
government
was
as
likely
as
any
private
employer
to
oppress
labor
the
approval
of
socialism
he
maintained
would
split
the
federation
on
the
rock
of
politics
weaken
it
in
its
fight
for
higher
wages
and
shorter
hours
and
prejudice
the
public
against
it
at
every
turn
he
was
able
to
vanquish
the
socialists
in
the
federation
although
he
could
not
prevent
it
from
endorsing

at

convention
of
extreme
some
of
the
socialists
defeated
in
their
efforts
to
capture
organized
labor
and
seeing
that
the
gains
in
elections
were
very
meager
broke
away
from
both
trade
unionism
and
politics
one
faction
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
founded
in
declared
themselves
opposed
to
all
capitalists
the
wages
system
and
craft
unions
they
asserted
that
the
working
class
and
the
employing
class
have
nothing
in
common
and
that
trade
unions
only
pitted
one
set
of
workers
against
another
set
they
repudiated
all
government

and
the

proclaiming
their
intention
to
unite
all

big
union
and
seize

this
doctrine
so
revolutionary
in
tone
called
down
upon
the
extremists
the
condemnation
of
the
american
federation
of
labor
as
well
as
of
the
general
public
at
its
convention
in
the
federation
went
on
record
as
opposed
to
bolshevism
and
the
irresponsible
leadership
that
encourages
such
a
policy
it
announced
its
firm
adherence
to
american
ideals
federation
and
political
the
hostility
of
the
federation
to
the
socialists
did
not
mean
however
that
it
was
indifferent
to
political
issues
or
political
parties
on
the
contrary
from
time
to
time
at
its
annual
conventions
it
endorsed
political
and
social
reforms
such
as
the
initiative
referendum
and
recall
the
abolition
of
child
labor
the
exclusion
of
oriental
labor
pensions
and
government
ownership
moreover
it
adopted
the
policy
of
rewarding
friends
and
punishing
enemies
by
advising
members
to
vote
for
or
against
candidates
according
to
their
stand
on
the
demands
of
organized
labor
illustration
by
underwood
and
underwood
samuel
gompers
and
other
labor
leaders
this
policy
was
pursued
with
especial
zeal
in
connection
with
disputes
over
the
use
of
injunctions
in
labor
controversies
an
injunction
is
a
bill
or
writ
issued
by
a
judge
ordering
some
person
or
corporation
to
do
or
to
refrain
from
doing
something
for
example
a
judge
may
order
a
trade
union
to
refrain
from
interfering
with
men
or
to
continue
at
work
handling
goods
made
by
labor
and
he
may
fine
or
imprison
those
who
disobey
his
injunction
the
penalty
being
inflicted
for
contempt
of
court
this
ancient
legal
device
came
into
prominence
in
connection
with
railway
strikes
in
it
was
applied
with
increasing
frequency
after
its
effective
use
against
eugene
debs
in
the
pullman
strike
of
aroused
by
the
extensive
use
of
the
writ
organized
labor
demanded
that
the
power
of
judges
to
issue
injunctions
in
labor
disputes
be
limited
by
law
representatives
of
the
unions
sought
support
from
the
democrats
and
the
republicans
they
received
from
the
former
very
specific
and
cordial
endorsement
in
the
democratic
platform
denounced
government
by
injunction
as
a
new
and
highly
dangerous
form
of
oppression
gompers
while
refusing
to
commit
the
federation
to
democratic
politics
privately
supported
bryan
in
he
came
out
openly
and
boasted
that
eighty
per
cent
of
the
votes
of
the
federation
had
been
cast
for
the
democratic
candidate
again
in
the
same
policy
was
pursued
the
reward
was
the
enactment
in
of
a
federal
law
exempting
trade
unions
from
prosecution
as
combinations
in
restraint
of
trade
limiting
the
use
of
the
injunction
in
labor
disputes
and
prescribing
trial
by
jury
in
case
of
contempt
of
court
this
measure
was
hailed
by
gompers
as
the
magna
carta
of
labor
and
a
vindication
of
his
policy
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
it
did
not
prevent
the
continued
use
of
injunctions
against
trade
unions
nevertheless
gompers
was
unshaken
in
his
conviction
that
organized
labor
should
not
attempt
to
form
an
independent
political
party
or
endorse
socialist
or
other
radical
economic
theories
labor
and
the
besides
its
relations
to
employers
radicals
within
its
own
ranks
and
political
questions
the
federation
had
to
face
responsibilities
to
the
general
public
with
the
passing
of
time
these
became
heavy
and
grave
while
industries
were
small
and
conflicts
were
local
in
character
a
strike
seldom
affected
anybody
but
the
employer
and
the
employees
immediately
involved
in
it
when
however
industries
and
trade
unions
became
organized
on
a
national
scale
and
a
strike
could
paralyze
a
basic
enterprise
like
coal
mining
or
railways
the
vital
interests
of
all
citizens
were
put
in
jeopardy
moreover
as
increases
in
wages
and
reductions
in
hours
often
added
directly
to
the
cost
of
living
the
action
of
the
unions
affected
the
of
all
the
food
clothing
and
shelter
of
the
whole
people
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
the
issue
raised
by
this
state
of
affairs
it
was
suggested
that
employers
and
employees
should
lay
their
disputes
before
commissions
of
arbitration
for
decision
and
settlement
president
cleveland
in
a
message
of
april
proposed
such
a
method
for
disposing
of
industrial
controversies
and
two
years
later
congress
enacted
a
voluntary
arbitration
law
applicable
to
the
railways
the
principle
was
extended
in
and
again
in
and
under
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
many
contentions
in
the
railway
world
were
settled
by
arbitration
the
success
of
such
legislation
induced
some
students
of
industrial
questions
to
urge
that
unions
and
employers
should
be
compelled
to
submit
all
disputes
to
official
tribunals
of
arbitration
kansas
actually
passed
such
a
law
in
congress
in
the
railway
bill
of
the
same
year
created
a
federal
board
of
nine
members
to
which
all
railway
controversies
not
settled
by
negotiation
must
be
submitted
strikes
however
were
not
absolutely
forbidden
generally
speaking
both
employers
and
employees
opposed
compulsory
adjustments
without
offering
any
substitute
in
case
voluntary
arbitration
should
not
be
accepted
by
both
parties
to
a
dispute
immigration
and
americanization
problems
of
from
its
very
inception
the
american
federation
of
labor
like
the
knights
of
labor
before
it
was
confronted
by
numerous
questions
raised
by
the
ever
swelling
tide
of
aliens
coming
to
our
shores
in
its
effort
to
make
each
trade
union
it
had
to
wrestle
with
a
score
or
more
languages
when
it
succeeded
in
thoroughly
organizing
a
craft
it
often
found
its
purposes
defeated
by
an
influx
of
foreigners
ready
to
work
for
lower
wages
and
thus
undermine
the
foundations
of
the
union
at
the
same
time
persons
outside
the
labor
movement
began
to
be
apprehensive
as
they
contemplated
the
undoubted
evil
as
well
as
the
good
that
seemed
to
be
associated
with
the
alien
invasion
they
saw
whole
sections
of
great
cities
occupied
by
people
speaking
foreign
tongues
reading
only
foreign
newspapers
and
looking
to
the
old
world
alone
for
their
ideas
and
their
customs
they
witnessed
an
expanding
army
of
total
illiterates
men
and
women
who
could
read
and
write
no
language
at
all
while
among
those
aliens
who
could
read
few
there
were
who
knew
anything
of
american
history
traditions
and
ideals
official
reports
revealed
that
over
twenty
per
cent
of
the
men
of
the
draft
army
during
the
world
war
could
not
read
a
newspaper
or
write
a
letter
home
perhaps
most
alarming
of
all
was
the
discovery
that
thousands
of
alien
men
are
in
the
united
states
only
on
a
temporary
sojourn
solely
to
make
money
and
return
home
with
their
savings
these
men
willing
to
work
for
low
wages
and
live
in
places
unfit
for
human
beings
have
no
stake
in
this
country
and
do
not
care
what
becomes
of
it
restriction
of
in
all
this
there
was
strictly
speaking
no
cause
for
surprise
since
the
foundation
of
our
republic
the
policy
of
the
government
had
been
to
encourage
the
coming
of
the
alien
for
nearly
one
hundred
years
no
restraining
act
was
passed
by
congress
while
two
important
laws
positively
encouraged
it
namely
the
homestead
act
of
and
the
contract
immigration
law
of
not
until
american
workingmen
came
into
open
collision
with
cheap
chinese
labor
on
the
pacific
coast
did
the
federal
government
spread
the
first
measure
of
limitation
on
the
statute
books
after
the
discovery
of
gold
and
particularly
after
the
opening
of
the
railway
construction
era
a
horde
of
laborers
from
china
descended
upon
california
accustomed
to
starvation
wages
and
indifferent
to
the
conditions
of
living
they
threatened
to
cut
the
american
standard
to
the
point
of
subsistence
by
the
protest
of
american
labor
was
loud
and
long
and
both
the
republicans
and
the
democrats
gave
heed
to
it
in
congress
enacted
a
law
prohibiting
the
admission
of
chinese
laborers
to
the
united
states
for
a
term
of
ten
years
later
extended
by
legislation
in
a
little
while
the
demand
arose
for
the
exclusion
of
the
japanese
as
well
in
this
case
no
exclusion
law
was
passed
but
an
understanding
was
reached
by
which
japan
agreed
not
to
issue
passports
to
her
laborers
authorizing
them
to
come
to
the
united
states
by
act
of
congress
in
the
president
was
empowered
to
exclude
any
laborers
who
having
passports
to
canada
hawaii
or
mexico
attempted
to
enter
our
country
these
laws
and
agreements
however
did
not
remove
all
grounds
for
the
agitation
of
the
subject
they
were
difficult
to
enforce
and
it
was
claimed
by
residents
of
the
coast
that
in
spite
of
federal
authority
oriental
laborers
were
finding
their
way
into
american
ports
moreover
several
western
states
anxious
to
preserve
the
soil
for
american
ownership
enacted
laws
making
it
impossible
for
chinese
and
japanese
to
buy
land
outright
and
in
other
ways
they
discriminated
against
orientals
such
proceedings
placed
the
federal
government
in
an
embarrassing
position
by
treaty
it
had
guaranteed
specific
rights
to
japanese
citizens
in
the
united
states
and
the
government
at
tokyo
contended
that
the
state
laws
just
cited
violated
the
terms
of
the
international
agreement
the
western
states
were
fixed
in
their
determination
to
control
oriental
residents
japan
was
equally
persistent
in
asking
that
no
badge
of
inferiority
be
attached
to
her
citizens
subjected
to
pressure
on
both
sides
the
federal
government
sought
a
way
out
of
the
deadlock
having
embarked
upon
the
policy
of
restriction
in
congress
readily
extended
it
in
that
same
year
it
barred
paupers
criminals
convicts
and
the
insane
three
years
later
mainly
owing
to
the
pressure
of
the
knights
of
labor
it
forbade
any
person
company
or
association
to
import
aliens
under
contract
by
an
act
of
the
contract
labor
restriction
was
made
even
more
severe
in
anarchists
were
excluded
and
the
bureau
of
immigration
was
transferred
from
the
treasury
department
to
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
in
order
to
provide
for
a
more
rigid
execution
of
the
law
in
the
classes
of
persons
denied
admission
were
widened
to
embrace
those
suffering
from
physical
and
mental
defects
and
otherwise
unfit
for
effective
citizenship
when
the
department
of
labor
was
established
in
the
enforcement
of
the
law
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary
of
labor
wilson
who
was
a
former
leader
in
the
american
federation
of
labor
literacy
still
the
advocates
of
restriction
were
not
satisfied
still
organized
labor
protested
and
demanded
more
protection
against
the
competition
of
immigrants
in
it
won
a
battle
in
the
passage
of
a
bill
excluding
all
aliens
over
sixteen
years
of
age
physically
capable
of
reading
who
can
not
read
the
english
language
or
some
other
language
or
dialect
including
hebrew
or
yiddish
even
president
wilson
could
not
block
it
for
a
vote
to
overcome
his
veto
was
mustered
in
congress
this
act
while
it
served
to
exclude
illiterates
made
no
drastic
cut
in
the
volume
of
immigration
indeed
a
material
reduction
was
resolutely
opposed
in
many
quarters
people
of
certain
nationalities
already
in
the
united
states
objected
to
every
barrier
that
shut
out
their
own
kinsmen
some
americans
of
the
old
stock
still
held
to
the
idea
that
the
united
states
should
continue
to
be
an
asylum
for
the
oppressed
of
the
earth
many
employers
looked
upon
an
increased
labor
supply
as
the
means
of
escaping
what
they
called
the
domination
of
trade
unions
in
the
babel
of
countless
voices
the
discussion
of
these
vital
matters
went
on
in
town
and
country
intimately
connected
with
the
subject
of
immigration
was
a
call
for
the
americanization
of
the
alien
already
within
our
gates
the
revelation
of
the
illiteracy
in
the
army
raised
the
cry
and
the
demand
was
intensified
when
it
was
found
that
many
of
the
leaders
among
the
extreme
radicals
were
foreign
in
birth
and
citizenship
innumerable
programs
for
assimilating
the
alien
to
american
life
were
drawn
up
and
in
a
national
conference
on
the
subject
was
held
in
washington
under
the
auspices
of
the
department
of
the
interior
all
were
agreed
that
the
foreigner
should
be
taught
to
speak
and
write
the
language
and
understand
the
government
of
our
country
congress
was
urged
to
lend
aid
in
this
vast

thus
spoke
woodrow
wilson
during
his
campaign
for
election
in
this
spirit
as
president
he
gave
the
signal
for
work
by
summoning
congress
in
a
special
session
on
april
he
invited
the
coöperation
of
all
men
and
indicated
that
he
would
assume
the
rôle
of
leadership
as
an
evidence
of
his
resolve
he
appeared
before
congress
in
person
to
read
his
first
message
reviving
the
old
custom
of
washington
and
adams
then
he
let
it
be
known
that
he
would
not
give
his
party
any
rest
until
it
fulfilled
its
pledges
to
the
country
when
democratic
senators
balked
at
tariff
reductions
they
were
sharply
informed
that
the
party
had
plighted
its
word
and
that
no
excuses
or
delays
would
be
tolerated
domestic
legislation
under
this
spirited
leadership
congress
went
to
work
passing
first
the
underwood
tariff
act
of
which
made
a
downward
revision
in
the
rates
of
duty
fixing
them
on
the
average
about
per
cent
lower
than
the
figures
of
the
protective
principle
was
retained
but
an
effort
was
made
to
permit
a
moderate
element
of
foreign
competition
as
a
part
of
the
revenue
act
congress
levied
a
tax
on
incomes
as
authorized
by
the
sixteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
the
tax
which
roused
such
party
passions
twenty
years
before
was
now
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
having
disposed
of
the
tariff
congress
took
up
the
old
and
vexatious
currency
question
and
offered
a
new
solution
in
the
form
of
the
federal
reserve
law
of
december
this
measure
one
of
the
most
interesting
in
the
history
of
federal
finance
embraced
four
leading
features
in
the
first
place
it
continued
the
prohibition
on
the
issuance
of
notes
by
state
banks
and
provided
for
a
national
currency
in
the
second
place
it
put
the
new
banking
system
under
the
control
of
a
federal
reserve
board
composed
entirely
of
government
officials
to
prevent
the
growth
of
a
central
money
power
it
provided
in
the
third
place
for
the
creation
of
twelve
federal
reserve
banks
one
in
each
of
twelve
great
districts
into
which
the
country
is
divided
all
local
national
banks
were
required
and
certain
other
banks
permitted
to
become
members
of
the
new
system
and
share
in
its
control
finally
with
a
view
to
expanding
the
currency
a
step
which
the
democrats
had
long
urged
upon
the
country
the
issuance
of
paper
money
under
definite
safeguards
was
authorized
mindful
of
the
agricultural
interest
ever
dear
to
the
heart
of
jefferson
followers
the
democrats
supplemented
the
reserve
law
by
the
farm
loan
act
of
creating
federal
agencies
to
lend
money
on
farm
mortgages
at
moderate
rates
of
interest
within
a
year
had
been
lent
to
farmers
the
heaviest
borrowing
being
in
nine
western
and
southern
states
with
texas
in
the
lead
the
tariff
and
currency
laws
were
followed
by
three
significant
measures
relative
to
trusts
rejecting
utterly
the
progressive
doctrine
of
government
regulation
president
wilson
announced
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
democrats
to
destroy
monopoly
and
maintain
competition
as
the
only
effective
instrument
of
business
liberty
the
first
step
in
this
direction
the
clayton
act
carried
into
great
detail
the
sherman
law
of
forbidding
and
penalizing
combinations
in
restraint
of
interstate
and
foreign
trade
in
every
line
it
revealed
a
determined
effort
to
tear
apart
the
great
trusts
and
to
put
all
business
on
a
competitive
basis
its
terms
were
reinforced
in
the
same
year
by
a
law
creating
a
federal
trade
commission
empowered
to
inquire
into
the
methods
of
corporations
and
lodge
complaints
against
concerns
using
any
unfair
method
of
competition
in
only
one
respect
was
the
severity
of
the
democratic
policy
relaxed
an
act
of
provided
that
the
sherman
law
should
not
apply
to
companies
engaged
in
export
trade
the
purpose
being
to
encourage
large
corporations
to
enter
foreign
commerce
the
effect
of
this
whole
body
of
legislation
in
spite
of
much
labor
on
it
remained
problematical
very
few
combinations
were
dissolved
as
a
result
of
it
startling
investigations
were
made
into
alleged
abuses
on
the
part
of
trusts
but
it
could
hardly
be
said
that
huge
business
concerns
had
lost
any
of
their
predominance
in
american
industry
by
no
mere
coincidence
the
clayton
law
of
made
many
concessions
to
organized
labor
it
declared
that
the
labor
of
a
human
being
is
not
a
commodity
or
an
article
of
commerce
and
it
exempted
unions
from
prosecution
as
combinations
in
restraint
of
trade
it
likewise
defined
and
limited
the
uses
which
the
federal
courts
might
make
of
injunctions
in
labor
disputes
and
guaranteed
trial
by
jury
to
those
guilty
of
disobedience
see
the
clayton
law
was
followed
the
next
year
by
the
seamen
act
giving
greater
liberty
of
contract
to
american
sailors
and
requiring
an
improvement
of
living
conditions
on
shipboard
this
was
such
a
drastic
law
that
shipowners
declared
themselves
unable
to
meet
foreign
competition
under
its
terms
owing
to
the
low
labor
standards
of
other
countries
still
more
extraordinary
than
the
seamen
act
was
the
adamson
law
of
fixing
a
standard
for
trainmen
on
railroads
a
measure
wrung
from
congress
under
a
threat
of
a
great
strike
by
the
four
railway
brotherhoods
this
act
viewed
by
union
leaders
as
a
triumph
called
forth
a
bitter
denunciation
of
trade
union
domination
but
it
was
easier
to
criticize
than
to
find
another
solution
of
the
problem
three
other
laws
enacted
during
president
wilson
administration
were
popular
in
the
labor
world
one
of
them
provided
compensation
for
federal
employees
injured
in
the
discharge
of
their
duties
another
prohibited
the
labor
of
children
under
a
certain
age
in
the
industries
of
the
nation
a
third
prescribed
for
coal
miners
in
alaska
an
day
and
modern
safeguards
for
life
and
health
there
were
positive
proofs
that
organized
labor
had
obtained
a
large
share
of
power
in
the
councils
of
the
country
and
state
if
the
interference
of
the
government
with
business
and
labor
represented
a
departure
from
the
old
idea
of
the
less
government
the
better
what
can
be
said
of
a
large
body
of
laws
affecting
the
rights
of
states
the
prohibition
of
child
labor
everywhere
was
one
indication
of
the
new
tendency
wilson
had
once
declared
such
legislation
unconstitutional
the
supreme
court
declared
it
unconstitutional
but
congress
undaunted
carried
it
into
effect
under
the
guise
of
a
tax
on
goods
made
by
children
below
the
age
limit
there
were
other
indications
of
the
drift
large
sums
of
money
were
appropriated
by
congress
in
to
assist
the
states
in
building
and
maintaining
highways
the
same
year
the
farm
loan
act
projected
the
federal
government
into
the
sphere
of
local
money
lending
in
millions
of
dollars
were
granted
to
states
in
aid
of
vocational
education
incidentally
imposing
uniform
standards
throughout
the
country
evidently
the
government
was
no
longer
limited
to
the
duties
of
the
policeman
prohibition
a
still
more
significant
form
of
intervention
in
state
affairs
was
the
passage
in
december
of
an
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
establishing
national
prohibition
of
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
intoxicating
liquors
as
beverages
this
was
the
climax
of
a
historical
movement
extending
over
half
a
century
in
a
national
prohibition
party
launched
three
years
before
nominated
its
first
presidential
candidate
and
inaugurated
a
campaign
of
agitation
though
its
vote
was
never
large
the
cause
for
which
it
stood
found
increasing
favor
among
the
people
state
after
state
by
popular
referendum
abolished
the
liquor
traffic
within
its
borders
by
at
least
of
the
were
dry
when
the
federal
amendment
was
submitted
for
approval
the
ratification
was
surprisingly
swift
in
a
little
more
than
a
year
namely
on
january
it
was
proclaimed
twelve
months
later
the
amendment
went
into
effect
colonial
and
foreign
policies
philippines
and
porto
independence
for
the
philippines
and
larger
for
porto
rico
had
been
among
the
policies
of
the
democratic
party
since
the
campaign
of
president
wilson
in
his
annual
messages
urged
upon
congress
more
autonomy
for
the
filipinos
and
a
definite
promise
of
final
independence
the
result
was
the
jones
organic
act
for
the
philippines
passed
in
this
measure
provided
that
the
upper
as
well
as
the
lower
house
of
the
philippine
legislature
should
be
elected
by
popular
vote
and
declared
it
to
be
the
intention
of
the
united
states
to
grant
independence
as
soon
as
a
stable
government
can
be
established
this
said
president
wilson
on
signing
the
bill
is
a
very
satisfactory
advance
in
our
policy
of
extending
to
them
and
control
of
their
own
affairs
the
following
year
congress
yielding
to
president
wilson
insistence
passed
a
new
organic
act
for
porto
rico
making
both
houses
of
the
legislature
elective
and
conferring
american
citizenship
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
illustration
the
caribbean
region
power
in
the
while
extending
more
to
its
dominions
the
united
states
enlarged
its
sphere
of
influence
in
the
caribbean
the
supervision
of
finances
in
santo
domingo
inaugurated
in
roosevelt
administration
was
transformed
into
a
protectorate
under
wilson
in
dissensions
in
the
republic
led
to
the
landing
of
american
marines
to
supervise
the
elections
two
years
later
an
officer
in
the
american
navy
with
authority
from
washington
placed
the
entire
republic
in
a
state
of
military
occupation
he
proceeded
to
suspend
the
government
and
laws
of
the
country
exile
the
president
suppress
the
congress
and
substitute
american
military
authority
in
a
consulting
board
of
four
prominent
dominicans
was
appointed
to
aid
the
american
military
governor
but
it
resigned
the
next
year
after
making
a
plea
for
the
restoration
of
independence
to
the
republic
for
all
practical
purposes
it
seemed
the
sovereignty
of
santo
domingo
had
been
transferred
to
the
united
states
in
the
neighboring
republic
of
haiti
a
similar
state
of
affairs
existed
in
the
summer
of
a
revolution
broke
out
there
one
of
a
long
series
beginning
in
and
our
marines
were
landed
to
restore
order
elections
were
held
under
the
supervision
of
american
officers
and
a
treaty
was
drawn
up
placing
the
management
of
haitian
finances
and
the
local
constabulary
under
american
authority
in
taking
this
action
our
secretary
of
state
was
careful
to
announce
the
united
states
government
has
no
purpose
of
aggression
and
is
entirely
disinterested
in
promoting
this
protectorate
still
it
must
be
said
that
there
were
vigorous
protests
on
the
part
of
natives
and
american
citizens
against
the
conduct
of
our
agents
in
the
island
in
president
wilson
was
considering
withdrawal
in
line
with
american
policy
in
the
west
indian
waters
was
the
purchase
in
of
the
danish
islands
just
off
the
coast
of
porto
rico
the
strategic
position
of
the
islands
especially
in
relation
to
haiti
and
porto
rico
made
them
an
object
of
american
concern
as
early
as
when
a
treaty
of
purchase
was
negotiated
only
to
be
rejected
by
the
senate
of
the
united
states
in
a
second
arrangement
was
made
but
this
time
it
was
defeated
by
the
upper
house
of
the
danish
parliament
the
third
treaty
brought
an
end
to
fifty
years
of
bargaining
and
the
stars
and
stripes
were
raised
over
croix
thomas
john
and
numerous
minor
islands
scattered
about
in
the
neighborhood
it
would
be
suicidal
commented
a
new
york
newspaper
for
america
on
the
threshold
of
a
great
commercial
expansion
in
south
america
to
suffer
a
heligoland
or
a
gibraltar
or
an
aden
to
be
erected
by
her
rivals
at
the
mouth
of
her
suez
on
the
mainland
american
power
was
strengthened
by
the
establishment
of
a
protectorate
over
nicaragua
in
the
extension
of
american
enterprise
southward
into
latin
america
of
which
the
operations
in
the
caribbean
regions
were
merely
one
phase
naturally
carried
americans
into
mexico
to
develop
the
natural
resources
of
that
country
under
the
iron
rule
of
general
porfirio
diaz
established
in
and
maintained
with
only
a
short
break
until
mexico
had
become
increasingly
attractive
to
our
business
men
on
the
invitation
of
president
diaz
they
had
invested
huge
sums
in
mexican
lands
oil
fields
and
mines
and
had
laid
the
foundations
of
a
new
industrial
order
the
severe
régime
instituted
by
diaz
however
stirred
popular
discontent
the
peons
or
serfs
demanded
the
of
the
great
estates
some
of
which
had
come
down
from
the
days
of
cortez
their
clamor
for
the
restoration
of
the
land
to
the
people
could
not
be
silenced
in
diaz
was
forced
to
resign
and
left
the
country
mexico
now
slid
down
the
path
to
disorder
revolutions
and
civil
commotions
followed
in
swift
succession
a
liberal
president
madero
installed
as
the
successor
to
diaz
was
deposed
in
and
brutally
murdered
huerta
a
military
adventurer
hailed
for
a
time
as
another
strong
man
succeeded
madero
whose
murder
he
was
accused
of
instigating
although
great
britain
and
nearly
all
the
powers
of
europe
accepted
the
new
government
as
lawful
the
united
states
steadily
withheld
recognition
in
the
meantime
mexico
was
torn
by
insurrections
under
the
leadership
of
carranza
a
friend
of
madero
villa
a
bandit
of
generous
pretensions
and
zapata
a
radical
leader
of
the
peons
without
the
support
of
the
united
states
huerta
was
doomed
in
the
summer
of
the
dictator
resigned
and
fled
from
the
capital
leaving
the
field
to
carranza
for
six
years
the
new
president
recognized
by
the
united
states
held
a
precarious
position
which
he
vigorously
strove
to
strengthen
against
various
revolutionary
movements
at
length
in
he
too
was
deposed
and
murdered
and
another
military
chieftain
obregon
installed
in
power
these
events
right
at
our
door
could
not
fail
to
involve
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
the
disorders
many
american
citizens
lost
their
lives
american
property
was
destroyed
and
land
owned
by
americans
was
confiscated
a
new
mexican
constitution
in
effect
nationalizing
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
struck
at
the
rights
of
foreign
investors
moreover
the
mexican
border
was
in
constant
turmoil
even
in
the
last
days
of
his
administration
taft
felt
compelled
to
issue
a
solemn
warning
to
the
mexican
government
protesting
against
the
violation
of
american
rights
president
wilson
soon
after
his
inauguration
sent
a
commissioner
to
mexico
to
inquire
into
the
situation
although
he
declared
a
general
policy
of
watchful
waiting
he
twice
came
to
blows
with
mexican
forces
in
some
american
sailors
at
tampico
were
arrested
by
a
mexican
officer
the
mexican
government
although
it
immediately
released
the
men
refused
to
make
the
required
apology
for
the
incident
as
a
result
president
wilson
ordered
the
landing
of
american
forces
at
vera
cruz
and
the
occupation
of
the
city
a
clash
of
arms
followed
in
which
several
americans
were
killed
war
seemed
inevitable
but
at
this
juncture
the
governments
of
argentina
brazil
and
chile
tendered
their
good
offices
as
mediators
after
a
few
weeks
of
negotiation
during
which
huerta
was
forced
out
of
power
american
forces
were
withdrawn
from
vera
cruz
and
the
incident
closed
in
a
second
break
in
amicable
relations
occurred
in
the
spring
of
that
year
a
band
of
villa
men
raided
the
town
of
columbus
new
mexico
killing
several
citizens
and
committing
robberies
a
punitive
expedition
under
the
command
of
general
pershing
was
quickly
sent
out
to
capture
the
offenders
against
the
protests
of
president
carranza
american
forces
penetrated
deeply
into
mexico
without
effecting
the
object
of
the
undertaking
this
operation
lasted
until
january
when
the
imminence
of
war
with
germany
led
to
the
withdrawal
of
the
american
soldiers
friendly
relations
were
resumed
with
the
mexican
government
and
the
policy
of
watchful
waiting
was
continued
the
united
states
and
the
european
war
outbreak
of
the
in
the
opening
days
of
august
the
jealousies
of
european
nations
sharpened
by
new
imperial
ambitions
broke
out
in
another
general
conflict
such
as
had
shaken
the
world
in
the
days
of
napoleon
on
june
the
heir
to
the
throne
was
assassinated
at
serajevo
the
capital
of
bosnia
an
austrian
province
occupied
mainly
by
serbs
with
a
view
to
stopping
serbian
agitation
for
independence
laid
the
blame
for
this
incident
on
the
government
of
serbia
and
made
humiliating
demands
on
that
country
germany
at
once
proposed
that
the
issue
should
be
regarded
as
an
affair
which
should
be
settled
solely
between
and
serbia
meaning
that
the
small
nation
should
be
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
a
great
power
russia
refused
to
take
this
view
great
britain
proposed
a
settlement
by
mediation
germany
backed
up
austria
to
the
limit
to
use
the
language
of
the
german
authorities
we
were
perfectly
aware
that
a
possible
warlike
attitude
of
against
serbia
might
bring
russia
upon
the
field
and
that
it
might
therefore
involve
us
in
a
war
in
accordance
with
our
duties
as
allies
we
could
not
however
in
these
vital
interests
of
which
were
at
stake
advise
our
ally
to
take
a
yielding
attitude
not
compatible
with
his
dignity
nor
deny
him
our
assistance
that
made
the
war
inevitable
every
day
of
the
fateful
august
was
crowded
with
momentous
events
on
the
germany
declared
war
on
russia
on
the
the
germans
invaded
the
little
duchy
of
luxemburg
and
notified
the
king
of
belgium
that
they
were
preparing
to
violate
the
neutrality
of
his
realm
on
their
way
to
paris
on
the
same
day
great
britain
anxiously
besought
by
the
french
government

the
aid
of
the
british
navy

warships
made
hostile
demonstrations
in

channel
august
the
german
government
declared

the
following
day
great
britain
demanded
of

respect
for

neutrality
and
failing
to
receive
the
guarantee
broke
off
diplomatic
relations
on

the
british

its
pitiless
fury
state
of
american
although
president
wilson
promptly
proclaimed
the
neutrality
of
the
united
states
the
sympathies
of
a
large
majority
of
the
american
people
were
without
doubt
on
the
side
of
great
britain
and
france
to
them
the
invasion
of
the
little
kingdom
of
belgium
and
the
horrors
that
accompanied
german
occupation
were
odious
in
the
extreme
moreover
they
regarded
the
german
imperial
government
as
an
autocratic
power

in
the
interest
of

ambitious
military
party
the
kaiser
william
ii
and
the
crown
prince
were
the
symbols
of
royal
arrogance
on
the
other
hand
many
americans
of
german
descent
in
memory
of
their
ties
with
the
fatherland
openly
sympathized
with
the
central
powers
and
many
americans
of
irish
descent
recalling
their
long
and
bitter
struggle
for
home
rule
in
ireland
would
have
regarded
british
defeat
as
a
merited
redress
of
ancient
grievances
extremely
sensitive
to
american
opinion
but
ill
informed
about
it
the
german
government
soon
began
systematic
efforts
to
present
its
cause
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
most
favorable
light
possible
bernhard
dernburg
the
former
colonial
secretary
of
the
german
empire
was
sent
to
america
as
a
special
agent
for
months
he
filled
the
newspapers
magazines
and
periodicals
with
interviews
articles
and
notes
on
the
justice
of
the
teutonic
cause
from
a
press
bureau
in
new
york
flowed
a
stream
of
pamphlets
leaflets
and
cartoons
a
magazine
the
fatherland
was
founded
to
secure
fair
play
for
germany
and
austria
several
professors
in
american
universities
who
had
received
their
training
in
germany
took
up
the
pen
in
defense
of
the
central
empires
the
german
language
press
without
exception
it
seems
the
national
german
alliance
minor
german
societies
and
lutheran
churches
came
to
the
support
of
the
german
cause
even
the
english
language
papers
though
generally
favorable
to
the
entente
allies
opened
their
columns
in
the
interest
of
equal
justice
to
the
spokesmen
for
all
the
contending
powers
of
europe
before
two
weeks
had
elapsed
the
controversy
had
become
so
intense
that
president
wilson
august
was
moved
to
caution
his
countrymen
against
falling
into
angry
disputes
every
man
he
said
who
really
loves
america
will
act
and
speak
in
the
true
spirit
of
neutrality
which
is
the
spirit
of
impartiality
and
fairness
and
friendliness
to
all
concerned
we
must
be
impartial
in
thought
as
well
as
in
action
must
put
a
curb
upon
our
sentiments
as
well
as
upon
every
transaction
that
might
be
construed
as
a
preference
of
one
party
to
the
struggle
before
another
clash
over
american
as
in
the
time
of
the
napoleonic
wars
the
conflict
in
europe
raised
fundamental
questions
respecting
rights
of
americans
trading
with
countries
at
peace
as
well
as
those
at
war
on
this
point
there
existed
on
august
a
fairly
definite
body
of
principles
by
which
nations
were
bound
among
them
the
following
were
of
vital
significance
in
the
first
place
it
was
recognized
that
an
enemy
merchant
ship
caught
on
the
high
seas
was
a
legitimate
prize
of
war
which
might
be
seized
and
confiscated
in
the
second
place
it
was
agreed
that
contraband
of
war
found
on
an
enemy
or
neutral
ship
was
a
lawful
prize
any
ship
suspected
of
carrying
it
was
liable
to
search
and
if
caught
with
forbidden
goods
was
subject
to
seizure
in
the
third
place
international
law
prescribed
that
a
peaceful
merchant
ship
whether
belonging
to
an
enemy
or
to
a
neutral
country
should
not
be
destroyed
or
sunk
without
provision
for
the
safety
of
crew
and
passengers
in
the
fourth
place
it
was
understood
that
a
belligerent
had
the
right
if
it
could
to
blockade
the
ports
of
an
enemy
and
prevent
the
ingress
and
egress
of
all
ships
but
such
a
blockade
to
be
lawful
had
to
be
effective
these
general
principles
left
undetermined
two
important
matters
what
is
an
effective
blockade
and
what
is
contraband
of
war
the
task
of
answering
these
questions
fell
to
great
britain
as
mistress
of
the
seas
although
the
german
submarines
made
it
impossible
for
her
battleships
to
maintain
a
continuous
patrol
of
the
waters
in
front
of
blockaded
ports
she
declared
the
blockade
to
be
none
the
less
effective
because
her
navy
was
supreme
as
to
contraband
of
war
great
britain
put
such
a
broad
interpretation
upon
the
term
as
to
include
nearly
every
important
article
of
commerce
early
in
she
declared
even
cargoes
of
grain
and
flour
to
be
contraband
defending
the
action
on
the
ground
that
the
german
government
had
recently
taken
possession
of
all
domestic
stocks
of
corn
wheat
and
flour
a
new
question
arose
in
connection
with
american
trade
with
the
neutral
countries
surrounding
germany
great
britain
early
began
to
intercept
ships
carrying
oil
gasoline
and
copper
all
war
materials
of
prime
importance
on
the
ground
that
they
either
were
destined
ultimately
to
germany
or
would
release
goods
for
sale
to
germans
on
november
the
english
government
announced
that
the
germans
wore
sowing
mines
in
open
waters
and
that
therefore
the
whole
of
the
north
sea
was
a
military
zone
ships
bound
for
denmark
norway
and
sweden
were
ordered
to
come
by
the
english
channel
for
inspection
and
sailing
directions
in
effect
americans
were
now
licensed
by
great
britain
to
trade
in
certain
commodities
and
in
certain
amounts
with
neutral
countries
against
these
extraordinary
measures
the
state
department
at
washington
lodged
pointed
objections
saying
this
government
is
reluctantly
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
present
policy
of
his
government
toward
neutral
ships
and
cargoes
exceeds
the
manifest
necessity
of
a
belligerent
and
constitutes
restrictions
upon
the
rights
of
american
citizens
on
the
high
seas
which
are
not
justified
by
the
rules
of
international
law
or
required
under
the
principle
of
begins
the
submarine
germany
now
announced
that
on
and
after
february
the
whole
of
the
english
channel
and
the
waters
around
great
britain
would
be
deemed
a
war
zone
and
that
every
enemy
ship
found
therein
would
be
destroyed
the
german
decree
added
that
as
the
british
admiralty
had
ordered
the
use
of
neutral
flags
by
english
ships
in
time
of
distress
neutral
vessels
would
be
in
danger
of
destruction
if
found
in
the
forbidden
area
it
was
clear
that
germany
intended
to
employ
submarines
to
destroy
shipping
a
new
factor
was
thus
introduced
into
naval
warfare
one
not
provided
for
in
the
accepted
laws
of
war
a
warship
overhauling
a
merchant
vessel
could
easily
take
its
crew
and
passengers
on
board
for
safe
keeping
as
prescribed
by
international
law
but
a
submarine
ordinarily
could
do
nothing
of
the
sort
of
necessity
the
lives
and
the
ships
of
neutrals
as
well
as
of
belligerents
were
put
in
mortal
peril
this
amazing
conduct
germany
justified
on
the
ground
that
it
was
mere
retaliation
against
great
britain
for
her
violations
of
international
law
the
response
of
the
united
states
to
the
ominous
german
order
was
swift
and
direct
on
february
it
warned
germany
that
if
her
commanders
destroyed
american
lives
and
ships
in
obedience
to
that
decree
the
action
would
be
very
hard
indeed
to
reconcile
with
the
friendly
relations
happily
subsisting
between
the
two
governments
the
american
note
added
that
the
german
imperial
government
would
be
held
to
strict
accountability
and
all
necessary
steps
would
be
taken
to
safeguard
american
lives
and
american
rights
this
was
firm
and
clear
language
but
the
only
response
which
it
evoked
from
germany
was
a
suggestion
that
if
great
britain
would
allow
food
supplies
to
pass
through
the
blockade
the
submarine
campaign
would
be
dropped
of
american
meanwhile
germany
continued
to
ravage
shipping
on
the
high
seas
on
january
a
german
raider
sank
the
american
ship
in
the
south
atlantic
on
march
a
british
ship
the
was
sunk
by
a
submarine
and
many
on
board
including
an
american
citizen
were
killed
and
on
april
a
german
airplane
dropped
bombs
on
the
american
steamer
on
the
morning
of
may
americans
were
astounded
to
see
in
the
newspapers
an
advertisement
signed
by
the
german
imperial
embassy
warning
travelers
of
the
dangers
in
the
war
zone
and
notifying
them
that
any
who
ventured
on
british
ships
into
that
area
did
so
at
their
own
risk
on
that
day
the
a
british
steamer
sailed
from
new
york
for
liverpool
on
may
without
warning
the
ship
was
struck
by
two
torpedoes
and
in
a
few
minutes
went
down
by
the
bow
carrying
to
death
persons
including
american
men
women
and
children
a
cry
of
horror
ran
through
the
country
the
german
papers
in
america
and
a
few
american
people
argued
that
american
citizens
had
been
duly
warned
of
the
danger
and
had
deliberately
taken
their
lives
into
their
own
hands
but
the
terrible
deed
was
almost
universally
condemned
by
public
opinion
on
may
the
department
of
state
at
washington
made
public
the
first
of
three
famous
notes
on
the
case
it
solemnly
informed
the
german
government
that
no
warning
that
an
unlawful
and
inhumane
act
will
be
committed
can
possibly
be
accepted
as
an
excuse
or
palliation
for
that
act
or
as
an
abatement
of
the
responsibility
for
its
commission
it
called
upon
the
german
government
to
disavow
the
act
make
reparation
as
far
as
possible
and
take
steps
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
anything
so
obviously
subversive
of
the
principles
of
warfare
the
note
closed
with
a
clear
caution
to
germany
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
would
not
omit
any
word
or
any
act
necessary
to
the
performance
of
its
sacred
duty
of
maintaining
the
rights
of
the
united
states
and
its
citizens
and
of
safeguarding
their
free
exercise
and
enjoyment
the
die
was
cast
but
germany
in
reply
merely
temporized
in
a
second
note
made
public
on
june
the
position
of
the
united
states
was
again
affirmed
william
jennings
bryan
the
secretary
of
state
had
resigned
because
the
drift
of
president
wilson
policy
was
not
toward
mediation
but
the
strict
maintenance
of
american
rights
if
need
be
by
force
of
arms
the
german
reply
was
still
evasive
and
german
naval
commanders
continued
their
course
of
sinking
merchant
ships
in
a
third
and
final
note
of
july
president
wilson
made
it
clear
to
germany
that
he
meant
what
he
said
when
he
wrote
that
he
would
maintain
the
rights
of
american
citizens
finally
after
much
discussion
and
shifting
about
the
german
ambassador
on
september
sent
a
brief
note
to
the
secretary
of
state
liners
will
not
be
sunk
by
our
submarines
without
warning
and
without
safety
of
the
lives
of
provided
the
liners
do
not
try
to
escape
or
offer
resistance
editorially
the
new
york
declared
it
is
a
triumph
not
only
of
diplomacy
but
of
reason
of
humanity
of
justice
and
of
truth
the
secretary
of
state
saw
in
it
a
recognition
of
the
fundamental
principles
for
which
we
have
contended
presidential
election
of
in
the
midst
of
this
crisis
came
the
presidential
campaign
on
the
republican
side
everything
seemed
to
depend
upon
the
action
of
the
progressives
if
the
breach
created
in
could
be
closed
victory
was
possible
if
not
defeat
was
certain
a
promise
of
unity
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
conventions
of
the
republicans
and
progressives
were
held
simultaneously
in
chicago
the
friends
of
roosevelt
hoped
that
both
parties
would
select
him
as
their
candidate
but
this
hope
was
not
realized
the
republicans
chose
and
the
progressives
accepted
charles
hughes
an
associate
justice
of
the
federal
supreme
court
who
as
governor
of
new
york
had
won
a
national
reputation
by
waging
war
on
machine
politicians
in
the
face
of
the
clamor
for
expressions
of
sympathy
with
one
or
the
other
of
the
contending
powers
of
europe
the
republicans
chose
a
middle
course
declaring
that
they
would
uphold
all
american
rights
at
home
and
abroad
by
land
and
by
sea
this
sentiment
hughes
echoed
in
his
acceptance
speech
by
some
it
was
interpreted
to
mean
a
firmer
policy
in
dealing
with
great
britain
by
others
a
more
vigorous
handling
of
the
submarine
menace
the
democrats
on
their
side
renominated
president
wilson
by
acclamation
reviewed
with
pride
the
legislative
achievements
of
the
party
and
commended
the
splendid
diplomatic
victories
of
our
great
president
who
has
preserved
the
vital
interests
of
our
government
and
its
citizens
and
kept
us
out
of
war
in
the
election
which
ensued
president
wilson
popular
vote
exceeded
that
cast
for
hughes
by
more
than
half
a
million
while
his
electoral
vote
stood
to
the
result
was
regarded
and
not
without
warrant
as
a
great
personal
triumph
for
the
president
he
had
received
the
largest
vote
yet
cast
for
a
presidential
candidate
the
progressive
party
practically
disappeared
and
the
socialists
suffered
a
severe
falling
far
behind
the
vote
of
wilson
urges
peace
upon
the
warring
apparently
convinced
that
his
pacific
policies
had
been
profoundly
approved
by
his
countrymen
president
wilson
soon
after
the
election
addressed
peace
notes
to
the
european
belligerents
on
december
the
german
emperor
proposed
to
the
allied
powers
that
they
enter
into
peace
negotiations
a
suggestion
that
was
treated
as
a
mere
political
maneuver
by
the
opposing
governments
two
days
later
president
wilson
sent
a
note
to
the
warring
nations
asking
them
to
avow
the
terms
upon
which
war
might
be
concluded
to
these
notes
the
central
powers
replied
that
they
were
ready
to
meet
their
antagonists
in
a
peace
conference
and
allied
powers
answered
by
presenting
certain
conditions
precedent
to
a
satisfactory
settlement
on
january
president
wilson
in
an
address
before
the
senate
declared
it
to
be
a
duty
of
the
united
states
to
take
part
in
the
establishment
of
a
stable
peace
on
the
basis
of
certain
principles
these
were
in
short
peace
without
victory
the
right
of
nationalities
to
freedom
and
the
independence
of
poland
freedom
of
the
seas
the
reduction
of
armaments
and
the
abolition
of
entangling
alliances
the
whole
world
was
discussing
the
president
remarkable
message
when
it
was
dumbfounded
to
hear
on
january
that
the
german
ambassador
at
washington
had
announced
the
official
renewal
of
ruthless
submarine
warfare
the
united
states
at
war
toward
three
days
after
the
receipt
of
the
news
that
the
german
government
intended
to
return
to
its
former
submarine
policy
president
wilson
severed
diplomatic
relations
with
the
german
empire
at
the
same
time
he
explained
to
congress
that
he
desired
no
conflict
with
germany
and
would
await
an
overt
act
before
taking
further
steps
to
preserve
american
rights
god
grant
he
concluded
that
we
may
not
be
challenged
to
defend
them
by
acts
of
willful
injustice
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
germany
yet
the
challenge
came
between
february
and
april
six
american
merchant
vessels
were
torpedoed
in
most
cases
without
any
warning
and
without
regard
to
the
loss
of
american
lives
president
wilson
therefore
called
upon
congress
to
answer
the
german
menace
the
reply
of
congress
on
april
was
a
resolution
passed
with
only
a
few
dissenting
votes
declaring
the
existence
of
a
state
of
war
with
germany
at
once
severed
diplomatic
relations
with
the
united
states
but
it
was
not
until
december
that
congress
acting
on
the
president
advice
declared
war
also
on
that
vassal
of
the
german
government
war
in
many
addresses
at
the
beginning
and
during
the
course
of
the
war
president
wilson
stated
the
purposes
which
actuated
our
government
in
taking
up
arms
he
first
made
it
clear
that
it
was
a
war
of
the
military
masters
of
germany
he
exclaimed
denied
us
the
right
to
be
neutral
proof
of
that
lay
on
every
hand
agents
of
the
german
imperial
government
had
destroyed
american
lives
and
american
property
on
the
high
seas
they
had
filled
our
communities
with
spies
they
had
planted
bombs
in
ships
and
munition
works
they
had
fomented
divisions
among
american
citizens
though
assailed
in
many
ways
and
compelled
to
resort
to
war
the
united
states
sought
no
material
rewards
the
world
must
be
made
safe
for
democracy
its
peace
must
be
planted
upon
the
tested
foundations
of
political
liberty
we
have
no
selfish
ends
to
serve
we
desire
no
conquest
no
dominion
we
seek
no
indemnities
for
ourselves
in
a
very
remarkable
message
read
to
congress
on
january
president
wilson

down

famous

and
an

great
and
small
on
a
later
occasion
president
wilson
elaborated
the
last
point
namely
the
formation
of
a
league
of
nations
to
guarantee
peace
and
establish
justice
among
the
powers
of
the
world
democracy
the
right
of
nations
to
determine
their
own
fate
a
covenant
of
enduring
peace
these
were
the
ideals
for
which
the
american
people
were
to
pour
out
their
blood
and
treasure
selective
the
world
war
became
a
war
of
nations
the
powers
against
which
we
were
arrayed
had
every
man
in
service
and
all
their
resources
human
and
material
thrown
into
the
scale
for
this
reason
president
wilson
summoned
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
to
make
every
sacrifice
necessary
for
victory
congress
by
law
decreed
that
the
national
army
should
be
chosen
from
all
male
citizens
and
males
not
enemy
aliens
who
had
declared
their
intention
of
becoming
citizens
by
the
first
act
of
may
it
fixed
the
age
limits
at
to
inclusive
later
in
august
it
extended
them
to
eighteen
and
from
the
men
of
the
first
group
so
enrolled
were
chosen
by
lot
the
soldiers
for
the
world
war
who
with
the
regular
army
and
the
national
guard
formed
the
american
expeditionary
force
upholding
the
american
cause
on
the
battlefields
of
europe
the
whole
nation
said
the
president
must
be
a
team
in
which
each
man
shall
play
the
part
for
which
he
is
best
fitted
loans
and
in
order
that
the
military
and
naval
forces
should
be
stinted
in
no
respect
the
nation
was
called
upon
to
place
its
financial
resources
at
the
service
of
the
government
some
urged
the
conscription
of
wealth
as
well
as
men
meaning
the
support
of
the
war
out
of
taxes
upon
great
fortunes
but
more
conservative
counsels
prevailed
four
great
liberty
loans
were
floated
all
the
agencies
of
modern
publicity
being
employed
to
enlist
popular
interest
the
first
loan
had
four
and
a
half
million
subscribers
the
fourth
more
than
twenty
million
combined
with
loans
were
heavy
taxes
a
progressive
tax
was
laid
upon
incomes
beginning
with
four
per
cent
on
incomes
in
the
lower
ranges
and
rising
to
per
cent
of
that
part
of
any
income
above
a
progressive
tax
was
levied
upon
inheritances
an
excess
profits
tax
was
laid
upon
all
corporations
and
partnerships
rising
in
amount
to
sixty
per
cent
of
the
net
income
in
excess
of
per
cent
on
the
invested
capital
this
said
a
distinguished
economist
is
the
mark
in
the
history
of
taxation
never
before
in
the
annals
of
civilization
has
an
attempt
been
made
to
take
as
much
as
of
a
man
income
by
taxation
material
no
stone
was
left
unturned
to
provide
the

required
in

and
laid
under
whatever
obligations
the
government
deemed
imperative
never
was
a
nation
more
completely
devoted
to
a
single
cause
a
law
of
august
gave
the
president
power
to
fix
the
prices
of
wheat
and
coal
and
to
take
almost
any
steps
necessary
to
prevent
monopoly
and
excessive
prices
by
a
series
of
measures
enlarging
the
principles
of
the
shipping
act
of
ships
and
shipyards
were
brought
under
public
control
and
the
government
was
empowered
to
embark
upon
a
great
program
in
december
the
government
assumed
for
the
period
of
the
war
the
operation
of
the
railways
under
a
presidential
proclamation
which
was
elaborated
in
march
by
act
of
congress
in
the
summer
of
the

business
of

was
provided

were
instituted
and
a
system
of
national
insurance
was
established
in
the
interest
of
the
men
in
service
never
before
in
the
history
of
the
country
had
the
government
taken
such
a
wise
and
humane
view
of
its
obligations
to
those
who
served
on
the
field
of
battle
or
on
the

espionage
and
sedition
by
the
espionage
law
of
june
and
the
amending
law
known
as
the
sedition
act
passed
in
may
of
the
following
year
the
government
was
given
a
drastic
power
over
the
expression
of
opinion
the
first
measure
penalized
those
who
conveyed
information
to
a
foreign
country
to
be
used
to
the
injury
of
the
united
states
those
who
made
false
statements
designed
to
interfere
with
the
military
or
naval
forces
of
the
united
states
those
who
attempted
to
stir
up
insubordination
or
disloyalty
in
the
army
and
navy
and
those
who
willfully
obstructed
enlistment
the
sedition
act
was
still
more
severe
and
sweeping
in
its
terms
it
imposed
heavy
penalties
upon
any
person
who
used
abusive
language
about
the
government
or
institutions
of
the
country
it
authorized
the
dismissal
of
any
officer
of
the
government
who
committed
disloyal
acts
or
uttered
disloyal
language
and
empowered
the
postmaster
general
to
close
the
mails
to
persons
violating
the
law
this
measure
prepared
by
the
department
of
justice
encountered
vigorous
opposition
in
the
senate
where
republicans
and
two
democrats
voted
against
it
senator
johnson
of
california
denounced
it
as
a
law
to
suppress
the
freedom
of
the
press
in
the
united
states
and
to
prevent
any
man
no
matter
who
he
is
from
expressing
legitimate
criticism
concerning
the
present
government
the
constitutionality
of
the
acts
was
attacked
but
they
were
sustained
by
the
supreme
court
and
stringently
enforced
illustration
by
underwood
and
underwood
the
launching
of
a
ship
at
the

yards
newark
and
the
in
view
of
the
restlessness
of
european
labor
during
the
war
and
especially
the
proletarian
revolution
in
russia
in
november
some
anxiety
was
early
expressed
as
to
the
stand
which
organized
labor
might
take
in
the
united
states
it
was
however
soon
dispelled
samuel
gompers
speaking
for
the
american
federation
of
labor
declared
that
this
is
labor
war
and
pledged
the
united
support
of
all
the
unions
there
was
some
dissent
the
socialist
party
denounced
the
war
as
a
capitalist
quarrel
but
all
the
protests
combined
were
too
slight
to
have
much
effect
american
labor
leaders
were
sent
to
europe
to
strengthen
the
wavering
ranks
of
trade
unionists
in
england
france
and
italy
labor
was
given
representation
on
the
important
boards
and
commissions
dealing
with
industrial
questions
trade
union
standards
were
accepted
by
the
government
and
generally
applied
in
industry
the
department
of
labor
became
one
of
the
powerful
war
centers
of
the
nation
in
a
memorable
address
to
the
american
federation
of
labor
president
wilson
assured
the
trade
unionists
that
labor
conditions
should
not
be
made
unduly
onerous
by
the
war
and
received
in
return
a
pledge
of
loyalty
from
the
federation
recognition
of
labor
contribution
to
winning
the
war
was
embodied
in
the
treaty
of
peace
which
provided
for
a
permanent
international
organization
to
promote
the
effort
of
labor
to
improve
social
conditions
the
league
of
nations
has
for
its
object
the
establishment
of
universal
peace
runs
the
preamble
to
the
labor
section
of
the
treaty
and
such
a
peace
can
be
established
only
if
it
is
based
upon
social
justice
the
failure
of
any
nation
to
adopt
humane
conditions
of
labor
is
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
other
nations
which
desire
to
improve
the
conditions
in
their
own
countries
american

in

as

declared

the

was
mobilized
american

were
thrown
open

immediate
provision
was
made
for

special
effort
was
made
to
stimulate
the
production
of

were
always
ready
to
do
their
full
duty
in
such
an
event
as
things
turned
out
the
service
of
the
american
navy
was
limited
mainly
to
helping
in
the
campaign
that
wore
down
the
submarine
menace
to
allied
shipping
war
in
owing
to
the
peculiar
character
of
the
warfare
in
france
it
required
a
longer
time
for
american
military
forces
to
get
into
action
but
there
was
no
unnecessary
delay
soon
after
the
declaration
of

steps
were
taken
to
give
military

german
colonies
and
the
old
ottoman
empire
presented
knotty
problems
it
was
finally
agreed
that
the
german
colonies
and
turkish
provinces
which
were
in
a
backward
stage
of
development
should
be
placed
under
the
tutelage
of
certain
powers
acting
as
mandatories
holding
them
in
a
sacred
trust
of
civilization
an
exception
to
the
mandatory
principle
arose
in
the
case
of
german
rights
in
shantung
all
of
which
were
transferred
directly
to
japan
it
was
this
arrangement
that
led
the
chinese
delegation
to
withhold
their
signatures
from
the
treaty
league
of
high
among
the
purposes
which
he
had
in
mind
in
summoning
the
nation
to
arms
president
wilson
placed
the
desire
to
put
an
end
to
war
all
through
the
united
states
the
people
spoke
of
the
war
to
end
war
no
slogan
called
forth
a
deeper
response
from
the
public
the
president
himself
repeatedly
declared
that
a
general
association
of
nations
must
be
formed
to
guard
the
peace
and
protect
all
against
the
ambitions
of
the
few
as
i
see
it
he
said
in
his
address
on
opening
the
fourth
liberty
loan
campaign
the
constitution
of
the
league
of
nations
and
the
clear
definition
of
its
objects
must
be
a
part
in
a
sense
the
most
essential
part
of
the
peace
settlement
itself
nothing
was
more
natural
therefore
than
wilson
insistence
at
paris
upon
the
formation
of
an
international
association
indeed
he
had
gone
to
europe
in
person
largely
to
accomplish
that
end
part
one
of
the
treaty
with
germany
the
covenant
of
the
league
of
nations
was
due
to
his
labors
more
than
to
any
other
influence
within
the
league
thus
created
were
to
be
embraced
all
the
allied
and
associated
powers
and
nearly
all
the
neutrals
by
a
vote
of
the
league
assembly
the
excluded
nations
might
be
admitted
the
agencies
of
the
league
of
nations
were
to
be
three
in
number
a
permanent
secretariat
located
at
geneva
an
assembly
consisting
of
one
delegate
from
each
country
dominion
or
colony
including
canada
australia
south
africa
new
zealand
and
india
and
a
council
consisting
of
representatives
of
the
united
states
great
britain
france
italy
and
japan
and
four
other
representatives
selected
by
the
assembly
from
time
to
time
the
duties
imposed
on
the
league
and
the
obligations
accepted
by
its
members
were
numerous
and
important
the
council
was
to
take
steps
to
formulate
a
scheme
for
the
reduction
of
armaments
and
to
submit
a
plan
for
the
establishment
of
a
permanent
court
of
international
justice
the
members
of
the
league
article
x
were
to
respect
and
preserve
as
against
external
aggression
the
territorial
integrity
and
existing
political
independence
of
all
the
associated
nations
they
were
to
submit
to
arbitration
or
inquiry
by
the
council
all
disputes
which
could
not
be
adjusted
by
diplomacy
and
in
no
case
to
resort
to
war
until
three
months
after
the
award
should
any
member
disregard
its
covenants
its
action
would
be
considered
an
act
of
war
against
the
league
which
would
accordingly
cut
off
the
trade
and
business
of
the
hostile
member
and
recommend
through
the
council
to
the
several
associated
governments
the
military
measures
to
be
taken
in
case
the
decision
in
any
arbitration
of
a
dispute
was
unanimous
the
members
of
the
league
affected
by
it
were
to
abide
by
it
such
was
the
settlement
at
paris
and
such
was
the
association
of
nations
formed
to
promote
the
peace
of
the
world
they
were
quickly
approved
by
most
of
the
powers
and
the
first
assembly
of
the
league
of
nations
met
at
geneva
late
in
treaty
in
the
united
when
the
treaty
was
presented
to
the
united
states
senate
for
approval
a
violent
opposition
appeared
in
that
chamber
the
republicans
had
a
slight
majority
and
a
vote
was
necessary
for
ratification
the
sentiment
for
and
against
the
treaty
ran
mainly
along
party
lines
but
the
republicans
were
themselves
divided
the
major
portion
known
as
reservationists
favored
ratification
with
certain
conditions
respecting
american
rights
while
a
small
though
active
minority
rejected
the
league
of
nations
in
its
entirety
announcing
themselves
to
be
irreconcilables
the
grounds
of
this
republican
opposition
lay
partly
in
the
terms
of
peace
imposed
on
germany
and
partly
in
the
covenant
of
the
league
of
nations
exception
was
taken
to
the
clauses
which
affected
the
rights
of
american
citizens
in
property
involved
in
the
adjustment
with
germany
but
the
burden
of
criticism
was
directed
against
the
league
article
x
guaranteeing
against
external
aggression
the
political
independence
and
territorial
integrity
of
the
members
of
the
league
was
subjected
to
a
specially
heavy
fire
while
the
treatment
accorded
to
china
and
the
sections
affecting
american
internal
affairs
were
likewise
attacked
as
unjust
and
dangerous
as
an
outcome
of
their
deliberations
the
republicans
proposed
a
long
list
of
reservations
which
touched
upon
many
of
the
vital
parts
of
the
treaty
these
were
rejected
by
president
wilson
as
amounting
in
effect
to
a
nullification
of
the
treaty
as
a
deadlock
ensued
the
treaty
was
definitely
rejected
owing
to
the
failure
of
its
sponsors
to
secure
the
requisite
vote
illustration
europe
league
of
nations
in
the
campaign
of
at
this
juncture
the
presidential
campaign
of
opened
the
republicans
while
condemning
the
terms
of
the
proposed
league
endorsed
the
general
idea
of
an
international
agreement
to
prevent
war
their
candidate
senator
warren
harding
of
ohio
maintained
a
similar
position
without
saying
definitely
whether
the
league
devised
at
paris
could
be
recast
in
such
a
manner
as
to
meet
his
requirements
the
democrats
on
the
other
hand
while
not
opposing
limitations
clarifying
the
obligations
of
the
united
states
demanded
the
immediate
ratification
of
the
treaty
without
reservations
which
would
impair
its
essential
integrity
the
democratic
candidate
governor
james
cox
of
ohio
announced
his
firm
conviction
that
the
united
states
should
go
into
the
league
without
closing
the
door
to
mild
reservations
he
appealed
to
the
country
largely
on
that
issue
the
election
of
senator
harding
in
an
extraordinary
landslide
coupled
with
the
return
of
a
majority
of
republicans
to
the
senate
made
uncertain
american
participation
in
the
league
of
nations
united
states
and
international
whether
america
entered
the
league
or
not
it
could
not
close
its
doors
to
the
world
and
escape
perplexing
international
complications
it
had
financial
and
commercial
connections
with
all
other
countries
our
associates
in
the
recent
war
were
heavily
indebted
to
our
government
the
prosperity
of
american
industries
depended
to
a
considerable
extent
upon
the
recovery
of
the
impoverished
and
countries
of
europe
there
were
other
complications
no
less
specific
the
united
states
was
compelled
by
force
of
circumstances
to
adopt
a
russian
policy
the
government
of
the
czar
had
been
overthrown
by
a
liberal
revolution
which
in
turn
had
been
succeeded
by
an
extreme
communist
dictatorship
the
bolsheviki
or
majority
faction
of
the
socialists
had
obtained
control
of
the
national
council
of
peasants
workingmen
and
soldiers
called
the
soviet
and
inaugurated
a
radical
régime
they
had
made
peace
with
germany
in
march
thereupon
the
united
states
joined
england
france
and
japan
in
an
unofficial
war
upon
them
after
the
general
settlement
at
paris
in
our
government
while
withdrawing
troops
from
siberia
and
archangel
continued
in
its
refusal
to
recognize
the
bolshevists
or
to
permit
unhampered
trade
with
them
president
wilson
repeatedly
denounced
them
as
the
enemies
of
civilization
and
undertook
to
lay
down
for
all
countries
the
principles
which
should
govern
intercourse
with
russia
further
international
complications
were
created
in
connection
with
the
world
war
wholly
apart
from
the
terms
of
peace
or
the
league
of
nations
the
united
states
had
participated
in
a
general
european
conflict
which
changed
the
boundaries
of
countries
called
into
being
new
nations
and
reduced
the
power
and
territories
of
the
vanquished
accordingly
it
was
bound
to
face
the
problem
of
how
far
it
was
prepared
to
coöperate
with
the
victors
in
any
settlement
of
difficulties
by
no
conceivable
process
therefore
could
america
be
disentangled
from
the
web
of
world
affairs
isolation
if
desirable
had
become
impossible
within
three
hundred
years
from
the
founding
of
the
tiny
settlements
at
jamestown
and
plymouth
america
by
virtue
of
its
institutions
its
population
its
wealth
and
its
commerce
had
become
first
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
by
moral
obligations
and
by
practical
interests
its
fate
was
thus
linked
with
the
destiny
of
all
mankind
summary
of
democracy
and
the
world
war
the
astounding
industrial
progress
that
characterized
the
period
following
the
civil
war
bequeathed
to
the
new
generation
many
perplexing
problems
connected
with
the
growth
of
trusts
and
railways
the
accumulation
of
great
fortunes
the
increase
of
poverty
in
the
industrial
cities
the
exhaustion
of
the
free
land
and
the
acquisition
of
dominions
in
distant
seas
as
long
as
there
was
an
abundance
of
land
in
the
west
any
man
with
initiative
and
industry
could
become
an
independent
farmer
people
from
the
cities
and
immigrants
from
europe
had
always
before
them
that
gateway
to
property
and
prosperity
when
the
land
was
all
gone
american
economic
conditions
inevitably
became
more
like
those
of
europe
though
the
new
economic
questions
had
been
vigorously
debated
in
many
circles
before
his
day
it
was
president
roosevelt
who
first
discussed
them
continuously
from
the
white
house
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
were
being
exhausted
he
advocated
their
conservation
huge
fortunes
were
being
made
in
business
creating
inequalities
in
opportunity
he
favored
reducing
them
by
income
and
inheritance
taxes
industries
were
disturbed
by
strikes
he
pressed
arbitration
upon
capital
and
labor
the
free
land
was
gone
he
declared
that
labor
was
in
a
less
favorable
position
to
bargain
with
capital
and
therefore
should
organize
in
unions
for
collective
bargaining
there
had
been
on
the
part
of
certain
great
trusts
those
responsible
should
be
punished
the
spirit
of
reform
was
abroad
in
the
land
the

system
was
attacked
it
was
alleged
that
the
political
parties
were

the

the
spirit
of
reform
broke
into
both
political
parties
it
appeared
in
many
statutes
enacted
by
congress
under
president
taft
leadership
it
disrupted
the
republicans
temporarily
in
when
the
progressive
party
entered
the
field
it
led
the
democratic
candidate
in
that
year
governor
wilson
to
make
a
progressive
appeal
to
the
voters
it
inspired
a
considerable
program

upon
the

their
struggles
their

their
place
in

of

raised
problems
of
the
first
magnitude
while
the
country
was
engaged
in
a
heated
debate
upon

the

war
broke
out
in

in
as
a
hundred
years
before
american
rights
upon

became
involved
at
once
they
were
invaded
on

germany
in

ruthlessly
destroyed

at

from

were
without

nothing
could
stay
the
hand
of

party
after
long
and
patient
negotiations
president
wilson
in
called
upon
the
nation
to
take
up
arms
against
an
assailant
that
had
in
effect
declared
war
upon
america
the
answer
was
swift
and
firm
the
national
resources
human
and
material
were
mobilized
the
navy
was
enlarged
a
draft
army
created
huge
loans
floated
heavy
taxes
laid
and
the
spirit
of
sacrifice
called
forth
in
a
titanic
struggle
against
an
autocratic
power
that
threatened
to
dominate
europe
and
the
world
in
the
end
american
financial
naval
and
military
assistance
counted
heavily
in

american

such
was

crowned
the

president

in

took
part
in

council
he
sought
to
redeem
his
pledge
to
end

by
forming
a
league
of
nations
to
keep
the
peace
in
the
treaty
drawn
at

was
a
covenant
binding
the

permanent
association
for
the
settlement

this
treaty
the
president
offered
to
the

for
ratification
and
to
his
country
for
approval
once
again
as
in
the
days
of

in
a

as
a
result
of
a
wholesome
reaction
against
the
purely
chronological
treatment
of

there
is
now
a
marked
tendency
in
the
direction
of
a
purely
topical
handling
of
the
subject
the
topical
method
however
may

can
be
understood
only
in

reason
the
best
results
are
reached
when
there
is
a
combination
of
the
chronological
and
the
topical
methods
it
is
therefore
suggested
that
the

first
follow
the
