preface
while
serving
on
the
staff
of
the
first
united
states
commission
to
the
philippine
islands
my
attention
was
called
to
the
life
and
writings
of
josé
rizal
i
found
in
his
novel
noli
me
tangere
the
best
picture
of
the
life
of
the
people
of
those
islands
under
spanish
rule
and
the
clearest
exposition
of
the
governmental
problems
which
spain
failed
to
solve
and
with
which
our
own
people
must
deal
it
occurred
to
me
that
an
english
translation
of
rizal
work
would
be
of
great
value
at
the
present
time
my
first
intention
was
to
reproduce
the
entire
novel
as
it
was
written
but
after
careful
consideration
i
thought
best
to
abridge
the
story
by
the
omission
of
some
parts
which
did
not
seem
essential
to
the
main
purpose
of
the
work
the
present
volume
is
the
result
readers
should
not
understand
any
of
rizal
references
to
priests
and
friars
as
reflections
upon
the
roman
catholic
church
he
was
throughout
his
life
an
ardent
catholic
and
died
a
firm
adherent
of
the
church
but
he
objected
to
the
religious
orders
in
the
philippine
islands
because
he
knew
well
that
they
were
more
zealous
in
furthering
their
own
selfish
ends
than
in
seeking
the
advancement
of
christianity
from
experience
rizal
knew
that
the
friars
under
cloak
of
the
gospel
ministry
oppressed
his
fellow
countrymen
and
took
advantage
of
their
superstition
and
ignorance
these
wrongs
he
was
brave
enough
to
expose
in
his
writings
in
the
friars
he
saw
an
obstacle
to
the
education
and
enlightenment
of
the
filipino
people
and
using
moderate
means
he
did
his
utmost
to
secure
reform
his
writings
will
explain
to
us
the
cause
of
the
hatred
shown
by
the
filipinos
toward
the
religious
corporations
and
will
make
clearer
the
nature
of
one
of
the
present
problems
in
the
philippines
there
are
in
the
philippines
five
religious
orders
the
dominicans
franciscans
recoletos
augustines
and
jesuits
according
to
john
foreman
an
eminent
authority
the
members
of
all
of
these
except
the
last
named
come
from
the
lower
classes
in
spain
and
are
on
the
whole
comparatively
ignorant
and
uncultured
under
the
spanish
system
of
government
certain
provinces
were
assigned
to
each
of
the
orders
except
the
jesuits
and
the
friars
were
distributed
among
the
different
parishes
in
the
town
assigned
to
him
the
friar
had
much
authority
he
was
chief
adviser
in
all
civil
affairs
and
by
his
influence
over
the
superstitious
natives
maintained
absolute
control
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
the
local
government
as
well
as
to
the
local
church
so
firm
was
his
hold
that
he
led
the
spanish
government
to
believe
that
the
islands
could
not
be
ruled
without
his
aid
knowing
that
his
power
rested
on
the
ignorance
of
the
people
he
discouraged
education
among
them
when
native
filipinos
advanced
so
far
as
to
prove
an
obstacle
to
the
religious
orders
as
did
rizal
and
many
others
the
friars
sought
to
destroy
them
forgetting
their
holy
mission
the
religious
orders
became
commercial
corporations
amassed
enormous
wealth
and
gained
possession
of
the
most
valuable
parts
of
the
islands
though
to
much
of
this
property
the
titles
are
not
clear
from
my
own
observation
and
from
information
derived
from
the
spaniards
themselves
i
am
convinced
that
the
author
has
not
overdrawn
his
pictures
in
fact
i
have
learned
of
instances
where
the
oppression
and
practices
of
the
friars
were
even
worse
than
those
described
rizal
has
given
us
a
portrayal
of
the
filipino
character
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
most
advanced
filipino
he
brings
out
many
facts
that
are
pertinent
to
questions
showing
especially
the
malayan
ideas
of
vengeance
which
will
put
great
difficulties
in
the
way
of
the
pacifying
of
the
islands
by
our
forces
the
reader
will
not
fail
to
notice
the
striking
similarity
between
the
life
of
ibarra
the
hero
and
that
of
rizal
the
author
a
short
sketch
of
whose
career
has
been

in
the

the
most
striking
character

be
found

islands

was
not
only
a
great
martyr
to
the
cause
of
liberty
and
to
the
advancement
of
his
fellow
men
but
he
was
without
doubt
the
greatest
filipino
ever
born
and
his
memory
is
cherished
by
his
people
as
we
ourselves
cherish
the
memory
of
washington

family
which
it
is
said
acknowledged
a
slight
mixture
of
chinese
blood
and
possessed
considerable
property
as
a
child
he
gave
evidence
of
extraordinary
precocity
he
is
said
to
have
written
poetry
in
his
native
tongue
at
eight
years
of
age
produced
a
successful

and

of
recognized
ability
after
passing
through
the
university
of
manila
and
receiving
much
instruction
at
the
hands
of
the
jesuit
fathers
he
was
sent
to
europe
to
complete
his
education
he
pursued
courses
of
study
in
spanish
and
german
universities
and
won
the
degrees
of

and

for
a
time
he
was
the
leading
assistant
in
the
office
of
a
specialist
at
vienna
while
in
europe
rizal
wrote
several
books
and
also
gave
considerable
time
to
sculpture
and
painting
his
artistic
ability
was
great
and
some
of
his
productions
are
now
treasured
by
friends
into
whose
possession
they
came
rizal
best
known
work
is
his
noli
me
tangere
written
in
belgium
about
or
this
novel
with
its
vivid
picture
of
life
in
the
philippines
and
its
exposure
of
spanish
misrule
and
oppression
won
for
him
the
bitter
hatred
of
the
friars
and
inspired
the
relentless
persecution
which
only
ended
with
the
taking
of
his
life
in
rizal
returned
to
the
philippines
but
was
soon
compelled
to
leave
his
native
land
in
order
to
escape
forcible
banishment
after
a
short
residence
in
japan
he
went
to
london
where
he
published
a
work
on
the
history
of
the
philippine
islands
about
the
same
time
a
sequel
to
noli
me
tangere
entitled
el
filibusterismo
was
published
the
hatred
of
the
priests
against
him
was
further
inflamed
by
this
production
and
the
government
in
manila
was
forced
by
the
friars
to
forbid
the
circulation
of
any
of
his
writings
copies
of
his
novels
were
burned
in
the
public
squares
and
it
was
worth
one
life
to
be
found
possessing
a
copy
until
very
recently
it
has
been
almost
impossible
to
obtain
a
copy
of
rizal
works
and
it
was
necessary
to
go
to
europe
to
secure
the
one
from
which
the
following
abridged
translation
was
made
in
rizal
was
so
overcome
with
a
desire
to
see
again
his
beautiful
fatherland
that
he
ventured
in
the
face
of
all
the
dangers
that
threatened
him
to
return
to
manila
he
had
scarcely
set
foot
on
shore
however
before
he
was
arrested
and
thrown
in
prison
the
friars
demanded
his
execution
on
the
ground
that
he
carried
incendiary
leaflets
for
the
purpose
of
stirring
up
a
rebellion
but
subsequent
inquiries
showed
that
such
leaflets
had
been
introduced
into
his
baggage
at
the
custom
house
through
the
intrigues
of
the
augustine
friars
despite
his
indignant
protestations
of
innocence
rizal
was
summarily
condemned
by
the
spanish
general
despujols
to
banishment
at
dapitan
in
the
island
of
mindanao
although
the
trickery
of
the
friars
became
known
to
him
despujols
lacked
courage
to
revoke
his
order
of
banishment
for
fear
that
he
too
would
incur
the
hatred
of
the
powerful
religious
corporations
after
four
years
of
exile
rizal
saw
plainly
that
the
hostility
of
the
friars
would
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
live
in
his
native
land
in
a
plague
of
yellow
fever
broke
out
in
the
island
of
cuba
and
rizal
volunteered
to
lend
his
medical
services
to
the
spanish
government
ramon
blanco
then
of
the
spanish
forces
in
the
philippines
accepted
the
generous
offer
and
recalled
the
young
man
to
manila
that
he
might
sail
at
once
for
cuba
alarmed
by
demonstrations
of
popular
affection
for
rizal
who
represented
the
aspirations
of
the
filipino
people
the
spanish
authorities
broke
faith
with
him
and
imprisoned
him
in
the
fuerza
de
santiago
he
was
arraigned
on
false
charges
given
a
military
trial
and
at
the
dictation
of
the
religious
orders
was
sentenced
to
be
shot
as
a
traitor
at
dawn
on
december
he
was
led
to
the
place
of
execution
on
the
beautiful
luneta
overlooking
the
tranquil
surface
of
manila
bay
notices
of
the
event
had
been
published
throughout
the
islands
and
the
day
on
which
it
was
to
occur
was
proclaimed
a
fiesta
thousands
gathered
around
the
place
selected
and
so
evident
was
the
sympathy
of
the
helpless
filipinos
for
the
man
who
was
to
die
for
their
sake
that
spain
marshalled
ten
regiments
of
her
soldiers
about
the
spot
the
populace
must
be
intimidated
a
nation
hero
was
about
to
become
a
nation
martyr
with
face
uplifted
he
glanced
at
the
multitude
about
him
and
smiled
they
tied
his
arms
behind
him
and
made
him
face
the
waters
of
the
bay
in
vain
he
protested
and
begged
that
he
might
die
facing
his
executioners
a
squad
of
his
fellow
countrymen
who
were
serving
in
spain
army
were
selected
for
the
bloody
work
they
drew
in
position
to
shoot
him
in
the
back
the
order
was
given
to
fire
but
only
one
had
the
courage
to
obey
the
bullet
went
straight
and
the
hero
fell
but
another
shot
was
necessary
to
despatch
his
life
his
newly
wedded
wife
remained
with
him
to
the
end
the
best
hope
of
the
filipino
people
was
crushed
a
light
in
a
dark
place
was
snuffed
out
rizal
was
no
extremist
no
believer
in
harsh
and
bloody
methods
no
revolutionist
he
aimed
to
secure
moderate
and
reasonable
reforms
to
lessen
the
oppressive
exactions
of
the
friars
to
examine
into
titles
of
their
land
and
to
make
possible
the
education
and
uplifting
of
his
people
he
loved
spain
as
he
did
his
own
country
and
repeatedly
used
his
influence
against
the
rebellious
measures
proposed
by
other
filipino
leaders
his
execution
was
only
one
of
the
numerous
outrages
which
characterized
spain
reign
in
the
philippines
in
closing
this
short
sketch
of
rizal
life
we
can
do
no
better
than
to
quote
the
estimate
of
him
made
by
ferdinand
blumentritt
professor
in
the
university
of
leitmeritz
austria
who
prepared
a
biographical
sketch
of
rizal
blumentritt
said
not
only
is
rizal
the
most
prominent
man
of
his
own
people
but
the
greatest
man
the
malayan
race
has
produced
his
memory
will
never
perish
in
his
fatherland
and
future
generations
of
spaniards
will
yet
learn
to
utter
his
name
with
respect
and
reverence

conversation
in
binondo
in
the

even
in

captain

was
generally
considered
a

his

his

shut
its
doors
to
no
one
whether
bent
on
pleasure
or
on
the
development
of
some
new

daring
scheme
the
dinner
was
given
in
the

in

the
building
is

and
has
been
illuminated
with
chinese
lanterns
in
many
colors
and
made
into
a
pretty
little
arbor
or
garden
the
sala
or
principal
room
of
the
house
where
the
guests
assembled
is
resplendent
with
colossal
mirrors
and
brilliant
chandeliers
and
upon
a
platform
of
pine
is
a
costly
piano
of
the
finest
workmanship
people
almost
filled
this
room
the
men
keeping
on
one
side
and
the
women
on
the
other
as
though
they
were
in
a
catholic
church
or
a
synagogue
among
the
women
were
a
number
of
young
girls
both
native
and
spanish
occasionally
one
of
them
forgot
herself
and
yawned
but
immediately
sought
to
conceal
it
by
covering
her
mouth
with
her
fan
conversation
was
carried
on
in
a
low
voice
and
died
away
in
vague
like
the
indistinct
noises
heard
by
night
in
a
large
mansion
an
elderly
woman
with
a
kindly
face
a
cousin
of
captain
tiago
received
the
ladies
she
spoke
spanish
regardless
of
all
the
grammatical
rules
and
her
courtesies
consisted
in
offering
to
the
spanish
ladies
cigarettes
and
betel
nut
neither
of
which
they
use
and
in
kissing
the
hands
of
the
native
women
after
the
manner
of
the
friars
finally
the
poor
old
lady
was
completely
exhausted
and
taking
advantage
of
a
distant
crash
occasioned
by
the
breaking
of
a
plate
hurried
off
precipitately
to
investigate
murmuring
jesús
just
wait
you
among
the
men
there
was
somewhat
more
animation
in
one
corner
of
the
room
were
some
cadets
who
chatted
with
some
show
of
interest
but
in
a
low
voice
from
time
to
time
they
surveyed
the
crowd
and
indicated
to
each
other
different
persons
meanwhile
laughing
more
or
less
affectedly
the
only
people
who
appeared
to
be
really
enjoying
themselves
were
two
friars
two
citizens
and
an
officer
of
the
army
who
formed
a
group
around
a
small
table
on
which
were
bottles
of
wine
and
english
biscuits
the
officer
was
old
tall
and
sunburnt
and
looked
as
the
duke
of
alva
might
have
looked
had
he
been
reduced
to
a
command
in
the
civil
guard
he
said
little
but
what
he
did
say
was
short
and
to
the
point
one
of
the
friars
was
a
young
dominican
handsome
and
dressed
with
extreme
nicety
he
wore
gold
mounted
spectacles
and
preserved
the
extreme
gravity
of
youth
the
other
friar
however
who
was
a
franciscan
talked
a
great
deal
and
gesticulated
even
more
although
his
hair
was
getting
gray
he
seemed
to
be
well
preserved
and
in
robust
health
his
splendid
figure
keen
glance
square
jaw
and
herculean
form
gave
him
the
appearance
of
a
roman
patrician
in
disguise
he
was
gay
and
talked
briskly
like
one
who
is
not
afraid
to
speak
out
brusque
though
his
words
might
be
his
merry
laugh
removed
any
disagreeable
impression
as
to
the
citizens
one
of
them
was
small
in
stature
and
wore
a
black
beard
his
most
noticeable
feature
being
his
large
nose
so
large
that
you
could
scarcely
believe
that
it
was
all
his
own
the
other
was
a
young
blonde
apparently
a
recent
arrival
in
the
country
the
latter
was
carrying
on
a
lively
discussion
with
the
franciscan
you
will
see
said
the
friar
when
you
have
been
in
the
country
a
few
months
and
will
be
convinced
that
what
i
say
is
right
it
is
one
thing
to
govern
in
madrid
and
another
to
rule
in
the
philippines
but
i
for
example
continued
father
dámaso
raising
his
voice
to
prevent
the
other
from
speaking
i
who
can
point
to
my
years
of
existence
on
bananas
and
rice
can
speak
with
some
authority
on
this
subject
do
not
come
to
me
with
theories
or
arguments
for
i
know
the
native
remember
that
when
i
came
to
this
country
i
was
sent
to
a
parish
small
and
largely
devoted
to
agriculture
i
did
not
understand
tagalog
very
well
but
i
received
the
confessions
of
the
women
and
we
managed
to
understand
each
other
in
fact
they
came
to
think
so
much
of
me
that
three
years
afterward
when
i
was
sent
to
another
and
larger
town
where
a
vacancy
had
been
created
by
the
death
of
the
native
parish
priest
all
the
women
were
in
tears
they
overwhelmed
me
with
presents
they
saw
me
off
with
bands
of
music
but
this
only
shows
wait
wait
do
not
be
in
a
hurry
my
successor
remained
there
a
still
shorter
time
but
when
he
left
there
were
more
people
to
see
him
off
more
tears
shed
and
more
music
played
although
he
had
treated
the
people
worse
than
i
and
had
raised
the
parish
dues
to
a
sum
almost
double
the
amount
i
had
exacted
but
allow
me
furthermore
i
was
twenty
years
in
the
town
of
san
diego
and
it
was
only
a
few
months
ago
that
that
i
left
twenty
years
surely
any
one
will
admit
that
twenty
years
is
time
enough
to
get
acquainted
with
a
town
there
were
six
thousand
people
in
san
diego
and
i
knew
every
one
of
them
as
if
he
were
my
own
child
i
knew
even
the
private
affairs
of
them
all
i
knew
in
what
way
this
man
was
where
the
shoe
pinched
that
one
what
slips
every
girl
had
made
and
with
whom
and
who
was
the
true
father
of
each
child
for
i
received
all
of
their
confessions
and
they
always
confessed
scrupulously
i
can
prove
what
i
say
by
santiago
our
host
for
he
has
considerable
property
in
that
town
and
it
was
there
that
we
became
friends
well
then
this
will
show
you
what
sort
of
people
the
natives
are
when
i
went
away
only
a
few
old
women
and
some
lay
brothers
saw
me
off
and
that
after
i
had
been
there
twenty
years
do
you
see
that
this
proves
beyond
a
doubt
that
all
the
reforms
attempted
by
the
ministers
of
the
government
in
madrid
are
perfectly
absurd
it
was
now
the
young
man
turn
to
be
perplexed
the
lieutenant
who
had
been
listening
to
the
argument
knit
his
brows
the
little
man
with
the
black
beard
made
ready
to
combat
or
support
father
arguments
while
the
dominican
was
content
to
remain
entirely
neutral
but
do
you
believe
the
young
man
finally
asked
in
a
curious
mood
and
looking
straight
at
the
friar
do
i
believe
it
as
i
do
the
gospel
the
native
is
so
indolent
ah
pardon
me
for
interrupting
you
said
the
young
blonde
lowering
his
voice
and
drawing
his
chair
closer
but
you
have
spoken
a
word
that
arouses
my
interest
is
this
indolence
an
inherent
characteristic
of
the
native
or
is
it
true
as
a
foreign
traveller
has
said
in
speaking
of
a
country
whose
inhabitants
are
of
the
same
race
as
these
that
this
indolence
is
only
a
fabrication
to
excuse
our
own
laziness
our
backwardness
and
the
faults
of
our
celestial
system
bah
that
is
nothing
but
envy
ask
señor
laruja
who
knows
this
country
very
well
whether
the
native
has
his
equal
in
the
world
for
indolence
and
ignorance
it
is
a
fact
replied
the
little
man
referred
to
that
nowhere
in
the
world
can
any
one
be
found
more
indolent
than
the
native
positively
nowhere
nor
more
vicious
and
ungrateful
nor
with
less
education
somewhat
uneasy
the
blonde
man
began
to
glance
about
the
room
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
believe
that
we
are
in
the
house
of
a
native
and
these
young
ladies
may
bah
do
be
so
sensitive
how
long
have
you
been
in
the
country
four
days
answered
the
young
man
somewhat
ruffled
did
you
come
here
as
an
employee
no
sir
i
came
on
my
own
account
in
order
to
become
acquainted
with
the
country
man
what
a
rare
bird
you
are
exclaimed
father
dámaso
looking
at
him
with
curiosity
to
come
here
on
your
own
account
for
such
foolish
ends
what
a
phenomenon
and
when
so
many
books
have
been
written
about
this
country
then
striking
the
arm
of
his
chair
with
sudden
violence
he
exclaimed
the
country
is
being
lost
it
is
lost
already
the
governing
power
supports
heretics
against
the
ministers
of
god
what
do
you
mean
again
asked
the
lieutenant
half
rising
from
his
chair
what
do
i
mean
repeated
father
dámaso
again
raising
his
voice
and
facing
the
lieutenant
i
mean
what
i
say
i
mean
that
when
a
priest
turns
away
the
corpse
of
a
heretic
from
his
cemetery
no
one
not
even
the
king
himself
has
the
right
to
interfere
and
still
less
to
punish
and
yet
a
general
a
miserable
little
general
father
his
excellency
is
the
representative
of
his
majesty
the
king
exclaimed
the
officer
rising
to
his
feet
what
do
i
care
for
his
excellency
or
for
any
of
your
representatives
answered
the
franciscan
rising
in
his
turn
in
any
other
time
than
the
present
he
would
have
been
thrown
down
stairs
in
the
same
way
as
the
religious
corporations
treated
the
sacrilegious
governor
bustamente
in
his
time
those
were
the
days
when
there
was
faith
i
tell
you
right
here
that
i
do
allow
any
his
excellency
represents
his
majesty
the
king
i
do
care
whether
he
is
king
or
rogue
for
us
there
is
no
king
other
than
the
true
stop
this
immediately
shouted
the
lieutenant
in
a
threatening
manner
and
as
though
he
were
commanding
his
own
soldiers
take
back
what
you
have
said
or
i
shall
inform
his
excellency
go
and
tell
him
at
once
go
tell
him
answered
father
dámaso
sarcastically
at
the
same
time
approaching
the
lieutenant
with
his
fists
doubled
do
you
think
for
a
moment
that
because
i
wear
the
dress
of
a
monk
i
not
a
man
hurry
go
tell
him
i
lend
you
my
carriage
the
discussion
began
to
grow
ridiculous
as
the
speakers
became
more
heated
but
at
this
point
fortunately
the
dominican
interfered
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
tone
of
authority
and
with
that
nasal
twang
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
friars
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
thus
confuse
matters
or
take
offense
where
it
is
not
intended
we
should
distinguish
between
what
father
dámaso
says
as
a
man
and
what
he
says
as
a
priest
whatever
he
may
say
as
a
priest
can
not
be
offensive
for
the
words
of
a
priest
are
understood
to
be
absolutely
true
but
i
understand
what
his
motives
are
father
sibyla
interrupted
the
lieutenant
who
saw
that
he
would
be
drawn
into
a
net
of
such
fine
distinction
that
if
he
allowed
it
to
go
on
father
dámaso
would
get
off
scot
free
i
know
very
well
what
his
motives
are
and
your
reverence
will
also
perceive
them
during
the
absence
of
father
dámaso
from
san
diego
his
assistant
buried
the
body
of
a
very
worthy
person
yes
sir
an
extremely
worthy
person
i
had
known
the
man
from
time
to
time
and
had
often
been
his
guest
what
if
he
never
had
been
to
confession
i
do
not
confess
either
to
say
that
he
committed
suicide
is
a
lie
a
slander
a
man
such
as
he
with
a
son
whose
success
and
love
were
more
than
all
the
world
to
him
a
man
who
believed
in
god
who
fulfilled
his
duty
to
society
who
was
honorable
and
just
such
a
man
does
not
commit
suicide
that
is
what
i
say
i
am
not
telling
you
all
that
i
think
about
this
matter
and
your
reverence
should
be
very
thankful
that
i
restrain
myself
turning
his
back
on
the
franciscan
he
continued
as
i
was
saying
this
priest
when
he
returned
to
the
town
after
maltreating
his
coadjutor
ordered
that
the
man
body
be
taken
up
and
thrown
out
of
the
cemetery
to
be
buried
i
know
not
where
the
town
of
san
diego
was
too
cowardly
to
protest
though
in
fact
very
few
people
knew
much
about
the
matter
the
dead
man
had
no
relatives
in
the
town
and
his
only
son
was
in
europe
his
excellency
however
learned
about
the
affair
and
being
at
heart
upright
and
just
he
ordered
that
the
priest
be
punished
as
a
result
father
dámaso
was
transferred
to
another
but
better
town
that
is
all
there
was
to
it
now
you
can
make
all
the
distinctions
you
like
so
saying
he
left
the
group
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
touched
upon
so
delicate
a
subject
said
father
sibyla
but
after
all
if
the
change
from
one
town
to
another
was
to
your
advantage
how
could
it
be
to
my
advantage
how
about
all
the
things
that
i
lost
interrupted
father
dámaso
fairly
boiling
over
with
rage
good
evening
gentlemen
good
evening
father
said
captain
santiago
who
at
that
instant
entered
the
room
leading
a
youth
by
the
hand
on
saluting
his
guests
in
this
manner
he
kissed
the
hands
of
the
priests
who
by
the
way
forgot
to
give
him
their
blessing
the
dominican
took
off
his
spectacles
in
order
to
examine
the
new
arrival
at
better
advantage
while
father
dámaso
turning
pale
at
the
sight
stared
at
the
youth
with
eyes
wide
open
i
have
the
honor
of
presenting
to
you
don
crisostomo
ibarra
the
son
of
my
deceased
friend
said
captain
tiago
the
young
man
has
just
arrived
from
europe
and
i
have
been
to
meet
him
at
the
mere
mention
of
the
name
exclamations
were
heard
in
all
parts
of
the
room
the
lieutenant
forgetting
himself
entirely
did
not
stop
to
salute
his
host
but
at
once
approached
the
young
man
and
surveyed
him
from
head
to
foot
the
youth
exchanged
the
usual
greetings
with
those
who
had
gathered
around
him
he
showed
no
striking
peculiarity
except
in
his
sombre
dress
which
was
in
deep
contrast
with
that
of
the
other
persons
present
his
athletic
build
his
appearance
and
every
movement
he
made
showed
however
that
a
fine
mind
and
a
healthy
body
had
both
been
highly
developed
you
could
see
from
his
frank
and
vivacious
face
that
he
had
spanish
blood
in
his
veins
although
his
hair
eyes
and
complexion
were
dark
his
cheeks
had
a
slight
color
due
no
doubt
to
residence
in
cold
countries
what
he
exclaimed
with
glad
surprise
the
parish
priest
of
my
own
town
father
dámaso
my
father
intimate
friend
every
one
in
the
room
looked
at
the
franciscan
but
the
latter
made
no
motion
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
have
made
a
mistake
added
ibarra
somewhat
in
doubt
because
of
the
apathy
of
the
friar
you
have
made
no
mistake
the
priest
finally
answered
in
a
strained
voice
but
your
father
was
never
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
ibarra
slowly
withdrew
the
hand
which
he
had
offered
looking
at
the
friar
with
great
surprise
as
he
turned
about
he
came
face
to
face
with
the
lieutenant
just
approaching
my
boy
are
you
the
son
of
don
rafael
ibarra
the
young
man
bowed
in
acquiescence
father
dámaso
settled
back
into
his
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
lieutenant
welcome
to
your
country
may
you
be
more
happy
in
it
than
was
your
father
exclaimed
the
officer
in
a
trembling
voice
i
had
many
dealings
with
your
father
and
i
knew
him
well
and
i
can
say
that
he
was
one
of
the
most
worthy
and
honorable
men
in
the
philippines
sir
replied
ibarra
with
emotion
your
praise
of
my
father
puts
me
in
doubt
as
to
his
fate
even
now
i
his
own
son
am
ignorant
of
it
all
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
filled
with
tears
he
turned
and
hurriedly
withdrew
ibarra
found
himself
standing
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
room
his
host
had
disappeared
and
he
turned
to
a
group
of
gentlemen
who
as
soon
as
they
saw
him
coming
formed
a
semicircle
to
receive
him
gentlemen
he
said
in
germany
when
a
stranger
attends
any
social
function
and
there
is
no
one
present
to
introduce
him
it
is
allowable
for
him
to
introduce
himself
permit
me
to
avail
myself
of
this
practice
gentlemen
my
name
is
juan
crisostomo
ibarra
y
magsalin
the
others
gave
their
names
in
turn
of
which
the
most
were
comparatively
unknown
my
name
is
a
a
said
one
of
the
young
men
bowing
stiffly
then
perhaps
i
have
the
honor
of
addressing
the
poet
whose
works
have
kept
up
my
enthusiasm
for
my
country
i
have
been
told
that
you
have
stopped
writing
but
no
one
has
told
me
why
why
because
there
is
no
use
in
invoking
the
muses
for
false
and
foolish
ends
a
case
has
been
made
out
against
one
man
for
having
put
into
verse
a
true
story
of
pero
grullo
i
am
not
going
to
get
myself
into
a
similar
scrape
they
may
call
me
a
poet
but
they
shall
not
call
me
a
fool
and
can
you
not
tell
us
what
that
true
story
was
yes
the
poet
said
that
the
son
of
a
lion
is
also
a
lion
and
for
saying
this
he
narrowly
escaped
being
banished
dinner
is
ready
announced
a
waiter
who
had
been
borrowed
from
the
cáfé
campaña
the
guests
began
to
file
into
the
dining
room
not
however
without
many
sighs
and
even
some
prayers
among
the
women
especially
the
natives
that
the
dreaded
affair
would
soon
be
over
chapter
ii
at
the
dinner
table
father
sibyla
wore
a
satisfied
air
he
moved
along
tranquilly
and
his
closed
thin
lips
showed
no
signs
of
disdain
on
the
other
hand
the
franciscan
was
in
a
very
bad
humor
as
he
walked
toward
the
table
he
kicked
over
the
chairs
which
happened
to
be
in
his
way
and
boxed
the
ears
of
one
of
the
cadets
the
lieutenant
was
very
solemn
and
grave
the
two
friars
instinctively
started
for
the
head
of
the
table
perhaps
by
force
of
habit
and
as
might
have
been
expected
they
met
on
opposite
sides
of
the
same
chair
then
with
ponderous
courtesy
each
entreated
the
other
to
sit
down
giving
in
turn
his
reasons
why
the
other
should
take
precedence
every
one
at
the
table
understood
how
both
really
felt
in
the
matter
and
all
knew
well
that
the
one
who
did
not
take
the
coveted
seat
would
grumble
discontentedly
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
the
farce
proceeded
something
like
this
you
take
it
brother
dámaso
it
is
for
you
no
you
take
it
brother
sibyla
you
are
an
old
friend
of
the
family
the
confessor
of
its
deepest
mysteries
your
age
your
dignity
your
no
that
is
all
right
as
far
as
age
goes
but
on
the
other
hand
you
are
the
priest
of
this
suburb
answered
father
dámaso
in
an
insincere
tone
without
however
leaving
the
chair
as
you
order
it
i
obey
concluded
father
sibyla
making
ready
to
sit
down
but
i
do
not
order
it
protested
the
franciscan
i
do
not
order
it
father
sibyla
was
about
to
take
the
seat
without
any
further
regard
to
the
protests
of
his
brother
when
his
eyes
chanced
to
meet
those
of
the
lieutenant
according
to
the
religious
customs
in
the
philippines
the
highest
military
officer
is
inferior
to
even
a
convent
cook
cedent
arma
togæ
said
cicero
in
the
senate
cedent
arma
cottæ
say
the
friars
in
the
philippines
father
sibyla
however
was
a
person
of
some
culture
and
refinement
and
as
soon
as
he
noticed
the
expression
on
the
lieutenant
face
said
here
we
are
now
out
in
the
world
and
not
in
the
church
this
seat
belongs
to
you
lieutenant
but
to
judge
from
the
tone
of
his
voice
he
thought
that
although
he
was
out
in
the
world
and
not
in
the
church
the
seat
nevertheless
belonged
to
him
the
lieutenant
either
to
save
himself
trouble
or
in
order
to
avoid
sitting
between
two
friars
declined
the
honor
in
a
very
few
words
neither
of
the
disputants
had
thought
of
the
owner
of
the
house
ibarra
saw
him
looking
upon
the
scene
and
smiling
with
satisfaction
how
is
this
don
santiago
are
you
going
to
sit
down
with
us
but
all
of
the
seats
were
already
occupied
and
lucullus
did
not
dine
in
the
house
of
lucullus
sit
still
do
get
up
said
captain
tiago
laying
his
hand
on
the
young
man
shoulder
the
fact
is
that
this
feast
is
given
in
honor
of
the
virgin
on
account
of
your
safe
arrival
here
bring
on
the
tinola
i
ordered
some
tinola
made
expressly
for
you
for
i
feel
quite
certain
that
you
have
not
had
any
since
you
left
the
philippines
a
long
while
ago
a
large
dish
was
brought
in
still
steaming
and
filled
to
the
brim
with
tinola
the
dominican
after
murmuring
the
benedicite
to
which
only
a
few
of
those
present
could
give
the
response
began
to
serve
the
contents
of
the
dish
either
from
carelessness
or
for
some
other
reason
he
passed
to
father
dámaso
a
plate
filled
with
the
soup
and
stew
but
containing
only
two
small
pieces
of
chicken
a
bony
neck
and
a
tough
wing
meanwhile
the
others
especially
ibarra
were
eating
all
sorts
of
choice
bits
the
franciscan
of
course
noticed
this
mussed
over
the
stew
took
a
mouthful
of
the
soup
dropped
his
spoon
with
a
clatter
into
his
plate
and
pushed
the
dish
to
one
side
while
this
was
going
on
the
dominican
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
conversation
with
the
young
blonde
señor
laruja
had
also
begun
to
converse
with
ibarra
how
long
has
it
been
since
you
were
last
in
this
country
said
he
about
seven
years
responded
ibarra
you
must
have
forgotten
all
about
it
on
the
contrary
although
my
country
seems
to
have
forgotten
me
i
have
always
kept
her
in
mind
what
do
you
mean
interposed
the
blonde
i
mean
that
for
over
a
year
i
have
not
received
any
news
from
here
so
that
now
i
feel
like
a
total
stranger
i
do
not
yet
know
how
or
when
my
father
died
ah
exclaimed
the
lieutenant
where
have
you
been
that
you
did
not
telegraph
asked
one
of
the
ladies
when
i
was
married
we
telegraphed
to
the
peninsula
señora
for
the
last
two
years
i
have
been
in
northern
europe
in
germany
and
in
poland
and
what
country
of
europe
do
you
like
best
asked
the
young
blonde
who
had
been
listening
interestedly
after
spain
which
is
my
second
fatherland
oh
any
free
country
in
europe
you
seem
to
have
travelled
a
great
deal
what
is
the
most
remarkable
thing
that
you
have
observed
asked
laruja
ibarra
appeared
to
be
reflecting
on
the
question
remarkable
in
what
way
for
instance
in
the
life
of
the
different
peoples
their
social
political
and
religious
life
ibarra
meditated
for
some
little
time
i
always
made
it
a
point
to
study
the
history
of
a
country
before
visiting
it
and
i
find
that
national
development
invariably
follows
perfectly
natural
rules
i
have
always
noticed
that
the
prosperity
or
poverty
of
different
peoples
is
in
direct
proportion
to
their
liberties
or
their
lack
of
liberty
or
in
other
words
in
proportion
to
the
sacrifices
or
selfishness
of
their
forefathers
and
is
that
all
you
have
observed
asked
the
franciscan
with
a
loud
laugh
up
to
this
time
he
had
not
uttered
a
single
word
but
had
given
his
attention
to
the
dinner
it
was
not
worth
while
to
squander
your
fortune
for
the
purpose
of
learning
such
a
trifle
a
thing
that
every
school
boy
knows
ibarra
looked
at
him
intently
doubtful
what
to
say
the
guests
glanced
at
each
other
fearing
that
a
quarrel
would
break
out
the
dinner
has
been
too
long
and
your
reverence
is
affected
by
too
much
wine
ibarra
was
about
to
reply
but
he
checked
himself
in
time
and
only
said
gentlemen
do
not
wonder
at
the
familiarity
with
which
our
old
parish
priest
treats
me
he
treated
me
this
way
when
i
was
a
child
and
the
years
that
have
passed
since
then
have
not
changed
his
reverence
i
derive
a
certain
amount
of
pleasure
from
it
for
i
am
reminded
of
those
days
when
his
reverence
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
our
house
and
honored
my
father
table
the
dominican
glanced
furtively
at
the
franciscan
who
was
trembling
ibarra
continued
rising
from
his
chair
you
will
allow
me
to
withdraw
for
i
have
only
just
arrived
and
i
must
leave
town
besides
i
have
a
great
many
things
to
do
before
i
leave
the
dinner
is
practically
finished
and
i
drink
very
little
wine
and
scarcely
touch
spirits
gentlemen
here
to
spain
and
the
philippines
saying
this
he
emptied
the
glass
which
until
then
he
had
not
touched
the
old
lieutenant
followed
his
example
but
said
nothing
do
not
go
said
captain
tiago
to
him
in
a
low
voice
maria
clara
is
coming
immediately
isabel
has
just
gone
to
get
her
the
new
parish
priest
of
your
town
is
also
coming
and
he
is
a
saint
i
shall
come
before
i
leave
i
have
to
make
a
most
important
visit
yet
and
really
must
go
with
this
he
took
his
departure
in
the
meantime
the
franciscan
had
recovered
himself
you
see
how
it
is
said
he
to
the
young
blonde
gesticulating
with
his
dessert
knife
it
is
nothing
but
pride
he
could
not
bear
to
have
a
priest
reprove
him
can
decent
people
believe
it
this
is
the
evil
consequence
of
sending
young
men
to
europe
the
government
ought
to
prohibit
it
that
night
the
young
blonde
wrote
among
other
things
in
the
first
chapter
of
his
colonial
studies
how
the
neck
and
wing
of
a
chicken
in
a
friar
plate
of
tinola
can
disturb
the
gayety
of
a
feast
and
among
his
other
observations
were
the
following
in
the
philippines
the
most
insignificant
person
at
a
dinner
or
a
feast
is
the
host
the
owner
of
the
house
has
only
to
remain
out
in
the
street
and
everything
will
go
along
beautifully
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
it
would
be
well
to
forbid
the
filipinos
to
leave
their
country
and
not
to
teach
them
how
to
read
chapter
iii
heretic
and
revolutionist
ibarra
was
still
confused
but
the
evening
breeze
which
in
manila
is
at
this
time
of
the
year
always
cool
and
refreshing
seemed
gently
to
lift
the
hazy
mist
which
hung
over
his
eyes
he
removed
his
hat
and
drew
a
deep
long
breath
men
of
all
nationalities
passed
by
in
swift
carriages
or
in
rented
calesas
he
was
walking
at
that
slow
pace
characteristic
alike
of
deep
thought
and
laziness
and
was
making
his
way
toward
the
plaza
of
binondo
he
looked
about
in
search
of
any
old
and
familiar
objects
yes
there
were
the
same
old
streets
the
same
old
houses
with
white
and
blue
fronts
the
same
old
walls
covered
with
whitewash
or
repainted
in
poor
imitation
of
granite
there
was
the
same
old
church
tower
its
clock
with
transparent
face
still
marking
the
hours
there
too
were
the
old
chinese
shops
with
their
dirty
curtains
and
iron
rods
one
of
which
remained
unrepaired
as
he
himself
had
bent
it
when
a
boy
things
go
slowly
here
he
muttered
and
continued
up
the
street
past
the
vestry
as
they
dished
up
flavored
ices
the
street
vendors
were
still
crying
sorbettes
the
same
little
cocoanut
oil
lamps
furnished
light
for
the
stands
where
native
women
and
chinese
disposed
of
their
sweetmeats
and
fruit
it
is
marvellous
he
exclaimed
there
is
the
same
chinaman
who
was
at
that
stand
seven
years
ago
there
is
that
same
old
woman
whom
i
remember
so
well
why
one
might
think
my
seven
years
in
europe
but
a
night
sleep
and
by
heavens
they
have
not
yet
repaired
this
broken
place
in
the
pavement
indeed
the
stone
which
had
been
torn
out
of
the
pavement
before
he
left
manila
had
not
yet
been
replaced
while
he
was
meditating
upon
the
wonderful
stability
of
things
in
so
unstable
a
country
some
one
placed
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
with
a
start
he
looked
up
and
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
old
lieutenant
who
also
had
left
the
captain
house
a
smile
had
displaced
the
officer
usual
harsh
expression
and
characteristic
frown
be
careful
young
man
said
he
remember
what
happened
to
your
father
i
beg
your
pardon
you
seem
to
have
esteemed
my
father
very
highly
can
you
tell
me
what
has
been
his
fate
asked
ibarra
gazing
intently
into
the
lieutenant
eyes
do
you
not
know
said
the
officer
i
asked
don
santiago
but
he
said
that
he
would
tell
me
nothing
until
have
you
no
information
regarding
him
why
yes
everybody
knows
about
him
he
died
in
prison
the
young
man
stepped
back
and
stared
wildly
at
the
officer
in
prison
who
died
in
prison
he
asked
in
astonishment
why
your
father
who
had
been
arrested
answered
the
officer
somewhat
surprised
what
my
father
in
prison
arrested
and
imprisoned
man
what
are
you
talking
about
do
you
know
who
my
father
was
are
you
asked
the
young
man
nervously
grasping
the
officer
arm
i
do
think
that
i
am
mistaken
don
rafael
ibarra
yes
don
rafael
ibarra
repeated
the
young
man
scarcely
able
to
utter
the
words
i
thought
that
you
knew
it
said
the
officer
in
a
sympathetic
voice
as
he
saw
the
emotion
his
words
had
caused
i
thought
that
you
knew
it
but
be
brave
here
you
know
no
man
can
be
honorable
without
being
imprisoned
i
can
not
believe
that
you
are
not
jesting
replied
ibarra
after
a
few
minutes
of
deep
silence
can
you
tell
me
for
what
offense
he
was
imprisoned
the
old
man
paused
as
if
to
meditate
it
seems
strange
to
me
that
you
have
not
been
kept
informed
as
to
the
affairs
of
your
family
my
father
last
letter
which
i
received
a
year
ago
told
me
not
to
be
uneasy
if
he
failed
to
write
to
me
for
he
was
very
busy
he
advised
me
to
continue
my
studies
he
sent
me
his
blessing
in
that
case
he
must
have
written
the
letter
to
you
shortly
before
his
death
it
is
almost
a
year
since
we
buried
him
in
his
own
town
why
was
my
father
arrested
asked
ibarra
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
the
cause
of
his
arrest
was
an
honorable
one
i
must
go
to
my
quarters
now
walk
along
with
me
and
then
i
can
tell
you
on
the
way
take
my
arm
they
walked
for
some
time
in
melancholy
silence
deep
in
thought
and
nervously
stroking
his
goatee
the
officer
sought
inspiration
before
he
could
begin
the
pitiful
tale
as
you
very
well
know
he
at
last
began
your
father
was
the
richest
man
in
the
province
and
although
he
was
loved
and
highly
respected
by
many
there
were
some
envious
persons
who
hated
him
your
father
had
a
great
many
enemies
among
the
priests
and
the
spaniards
some
months
after
your
departure
trouble
arose
between
don
rafael
and
father
dámaso
but
i
do
not
know
what
it
was
all
about
father
dámaso
accused
your
father
of
not
attending
confession
in
former
times
however
he
had
never
attended
confession
nothing
was
said
about
it
and
he
and
the
priest
were
good
friends
as
you
will
remember
furthermore
don
rafael
was
a
very
honorable
man
and
much
more
upright
and
just
than
many
who
go
to
confession
regularly
he
was
very
conscientious
and
in
speaking
to
me
in
regard
to
his
troubles
with
father
dámaso
used
to
say
guevara
do
you
believe
that
god
will
forgive
a
crime
a
murder
for
instance
simply
because
that
crime
has
been
confessed
to
a
priest
confessed
to
a
man
who
is
in
duty
bound
to
keep
it
secret
will
god
pardon
a
man
whose
repentance
is
brought
about
by
his
cowardly
fear
of
hell
i
have
a
very
different
opinion
of
god
i
can
not
see
how
one
evil
can
be
corrected
by
another
nor
how
pardon
can
be
procured
by
mere
idle
tears
and
donations
to
the
church
your
father
always
followed
the
strictest
rules
of
morality
i
may
safely
say
that
he
never
harmed
any
one
but
on
the
contrary
always
sought
by
doing
good
to
offset
certain
unjust
deeds
committed
by
your
grandfathers
however
his
troubles
with
the
priests
continued
and
took
on
a
dangerous
aspect
father
dámaso
alluded
to
him
from
the
pulpit
and
if
he
did
not
do
so
directly
by
name
it
was
an
oversight
on
his
part
for
anything
might
be
expected
from
a
man
of
his
character
i
foresaw
that
sooner
or
later
the
affair
would
have
a
bad
ending
the
old
lieutenant
paused
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
continued
about
this
time
there
came
to
the
province
a
man
who
had
been
in
the
artillery
but
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
ranks
on
account
of
his
brutality
and
ignorance
this
man
had
to
make
a
livelihood
he
was
not
allowed
to
engage
in
the
work
of
an
ordinary
laborer
since
that
might
damage
spain
prestige
but
somehow
obtained
the
position
of
collector
of
taxes
on
vehicles
he
had
no
education
whatever
and
the
natives
soon
found
it
out
a
spaniard
who
can
not
read
and
write
is
a
wonder
to
them
and
hence
he
became
the
subject
of
all
sorts
of
ridicule
knowing
that
he
was
being
laughed
at
he
became
ashamed
to
collect
his
taxes
this
had
a
bad
effect
on
his
character
which
was
already
bad
enough
people
used
to
give
him
documents
upside
down
to
see
him
pretend
to
read
them
he
would
make
a
show
of
doing
so
and
then
on
the
first
blank
space
he
found
would
fill
in
some
sprawling
characters
which
i
may
say
represented
him
very
accurately
the
natives
continued
to
pay
their
taxes
but
kept
on
ridiculing
him
he
fairly
raved
with
anger
and
worked
himself
up
to
such
a
frame
of
mind
that
he
respected
none
finally
he
had
some
words
with
your
father
it
happened
that
one
day
while
the
collector
was
studying
a
document
which
had
been
given
to
him
in
a
store
some
school
boys
came
along
one
of
them
called
the
attention
of
his
companions
to
the
collector
and
they
all
began
to
laugh
and
point
their
fingers
at
the
unhappy
man
the
collector
finally
lost
his
patience
turned
quickly
and
chased
his
tormentors
the
boys
of
course
ran
in
all
directions
at
the
same
time
mimicking
a
child
learning
the
alphabet
blind
with
rage
because
he
could
not
reach
them
he
threw
his
cane
struck
one
of
the
boys
on
the
head
and
knocked
him
down
not
content
with
this
he
went
up
and
kicked
the
boy
several
times
unfortunately
your
father
happened
to
be
passing
just
at
the
moment
indignant
at
what
he
saw
he
seized
the
tax
collector
by
the
arm
and
severely
reproached
him
for
his
actions
the
tax
collector
in
anger
raised
his
cane
to
strike
but
your
father
was
too
quick
for
him
with
that
strength
which
he
inherited
from
his
forefathers
he
as
some
say
struck
the
collector
or
as
others
claim
only
gave
him
a
push
the
fact
is
that
the
man
staggered
and
fell
to
the
ground
and
in
falling
struck
his
head
against
a
stone
don
rafael
quietly
lifted
up
the
wounded
boy
and
carried
him
to
the
court
house
near
by
leaving
the
collector
where
he
had
fallen
the
began
to
bleed
at
the
mouth
and
died
without
regaining
consciousness
naturally
the
law
stepped
in
they
showered
calumnies
of
all
kinds
upon
your
father
and
accused
him
of
being
a
heretic
and
a
revolutionist
to
be
a
heretic
is
a
great
misfortune
anywhere
or
at
any
time
but
it
was
especially
so
at
this
particular
time
for
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
province
was
the
loudest
prayer
maker
in
the
church
to
be
a
revolutionist
is
still
worse
one
might
better
have
killed
three
highly
educated
tax
collectors
than
be
thus
accused
everybody
deserted
your
father
and
his
books
and
papers
were
seized
he
was
accused
of
being
a
subscriber
to
correo
del
ultramar
and
to
madrid
newspapers
of
having
sent
you
to
germany
of
having
in
his
possession
incriminating
papers
and
pictures
and
well
i
do
know
what
not
he
was
even
attacked
because
although
he
was
the
descendant
of
spaniards
he
wore
the
dress
of
the
natives
if
your
father
had
been
anybody
else
he
would
have
been
acquitted
for
the
doctors
pronounced
the
death
of
the
collector
due
to
natural
causes
his
fortune
however
his
confidence
in
the
law
and
his
hatred
for
everything
which
seemed
unlawful
and
unjust
cost
him
his
life
i
myself
much
as
i
dislike
begging
for
mercy
called
upon
the
governor
general
the
predecessor
of
the
present
governor
i
brought
out
the
fact
that
a
man
who
aided
every
poor
spaniard
who
gave
food
and
shelter
to
all
and
whose
veins
were
filled
with
the
generous
blood
of
spain
such
a
man
could
not
be
a
revolutionist
in
vain
i
argued
for
him
pledged
my
own
life
for
him
and
swore
by
my
military
honor
what
did
it
all
amount
to
i
was
badly
received
curtly
and
summarily
dismissed
and
called
a
fool
the
old
man
paused
to
take
breath
his
young
companion
neither
looked
up
nor
made
a
sound
the
narrator
proceeded
i
took
charge
of
the
case
for
your
father
i
called
upon
the
celebrated
filipino
lawyer
young
a
a
but
he
refused
to
undertake
the
defense
would
lose
the
case
he
said
defense
would
cause
new
accusations
against
him
and
perhaps
bring
them
upon
me
go
and
see
señor
m
who
is
an
eloquent
orator
a
spaniard
and
a
man
of
great
reputation
i
did
so
and
the
celebrated
lawyer
took
charge
of
the
case
which
he
conducted
in
a
masterful
and
brilliant
manner
but
your
father
had
many
enemies
some
of
whom
did
their
work
secretly
there
were
many
false
witnesses
in
the
case
and
their
calumnies
which
anywhere
else
would
have
been
overthrown
by
a
single
sarcastic
phrase
from
the
defending
attorney
were
here
given
a
great
deal
of
weight
as
fast
as
the
attorney
proved
the
falsity
of
their
accusations
new
charges
were
brought
forward
they
accused
him
of
having
wrongfully
taken
possession
of
a
large
tract
of
land
they
sued
him
for
damages
and
for
injuries
caused
they
said
that
he
had
dealings
with
the
organized
bandits
or
tulisanes
and
that
thus
he
had
been
able
to
keep
his
property
unmolested
in
fact
the
case
became
so
complicated
that
within
a
year
no
one
understood
it
the
chief
magistrate
was
called
away
from
his
post
and
replaced
by
another
of
good
reputation
but
unfortunately
this
magistrate
too
was
displaced
in
a
few
months
the
sufferings
disappointments
and
discomforts
of
prison
life
and
his
great
grief
at
seeing
the
ingratitude
of
so
many
supposed
friends
finally
broke
down
your
father
iron
constitution
and
he
became
fatally
ill
when
it
was
all
over
when
he
had
proved
himself
not
guilty
of
being
an
enemy
to
his
country
and
innocent
of
the
death
of
the
tax
collector
he
died
in
prison
with
no
one
to
care
for
him
in
his
last
hours
i
arrived
just
as
he
was
expiring
the
old
man
had
finished
all
he
had
to
say
ibarra
overcome
with
grief
at
the
pathetic
story
he
had
heard
could
not
utter
a
word
the
two
had
arrived
at
the
gate
of
the
barracks
stopping
and
shaking
hands
with
the
young
man
the
officer
said
my
boy
captain
tiago
can
give
you
the
details
i
must
say
good
night
for
my
duty
calls
me
with
deep
emotion
ibarra
grasped
the
lean
hand
of
the
lieutenant
and
then
looked
after
him
in
silence
until
he
disappeared
in
the
building
turning
slowly
about
he
saw
a
carriage
passing
and
made
a
sign
to
the
cabman
lala
hotel
he
said
in
a
low
voice
this
fellow
is
just
out
of
jail
said
the
cabman
to
himself
as
he
whipped
up
his
horses
chapter
iv
captain
tiago
captain
tiago
was
short
in
stature
but
both
his
body
and
his
face
were
well
filled
out
his
complexion
was
clear
and
he
did
not
appear
to
be
more
than
thirty
or
years
old
although
he
was
really
more
than
that
in
these
times
his
face
always
wore
a
pleasant
expression
his
head
was
small
round
and
covered
with
hair
as
black
as
ebony
long
in
front
and
very
short
behind
this
head
according
to
reports
contained
a
great
many
things
his
eyes
were
small
but
not
terrifying
and
always
without
expression
in
short
the
captain
might
have
passed
for
a
little
man
if
his
mouth
had
not
been
disfigured
by
the
use
of
tobacco
and
the
betel
nut
the
juices
of
which
trickled
out
of
the
corners
of
his
lips
and
destroyed
the
symmetry
of
his
features
however
despite
these
habits
both
his
own
teeth
and
the
two
that
the
dentist
had
made
for
him
at
twelve
pesos
each
were
well
preserved
tiago
was
considered
one
of
the
richest
property
owners
in
binondo
and
he
also
owned
large
plantations
in
the
provinces
of
pampanga
and
laguna
de
bay
especially
in
the
town
of
san
diego
the
rent
of
all
these
lands
increased
every
year
san
diego
was
his
favorite
town
on
account
of
its
excellent
bathing
place
its
famous
cockpit
and
the
pleasant
memories
associated
with
the
neighborhood
he
spent
at
least
two
months
in
this
town
every
year
captain
tiago
also
had
a
great
deal
of
property
in
santo
cristo
in
analoague
street
and
in
rosario
street
in
partnership
with
a
chinaman
he
carried
on
a
profitable
business
in
opium
it
is
understood
that
he
had
contracts
with
the
government
for
feeding
the
prisoners
in
bilibid
and
that
he
supplied
fodder
to
many
of
the
principal
houses
in
manila
he
was
in
good
standing
with
the
authorities
able
clever
and
even
daring
in
his
speculations
in
the
necessities
of
others
hence
it
was
that
at
this
time
the
captain
was
as
happy
as
a
man
could
be
in
such
a
country
he
was
rich
and
was
at
peace
with
god
the
government
and
man
that
tiago
was
at
peace
with
god
was
indisputable
in
fact
there
was
no
reason
whatever
for
his
not
being
so
since
he
was
well
situated
as
far
as
worldly
matters
go
and
had
never
loaned
god
any
money
he
never
addressed
god
in
his
prayers
not
even
when
he
was
in
dire
straits
he
was
rich
and
his
money
he
thought
could
pray
for
him
for
masses
and
prayers
god
had
created
powerful
and
lofty
priests
for
special
religious
functions
and
rosaries
god
in
his
infinite
goodness
for
the
benefit
of
the
rich
had
created
poor
people
poor
people
who
for
a
peso
would
make
half
a
dozen
prayers
and
would
read
all
the
holy
books
even
to
the
hebrew
bible
if
the
pay
were
large
enough
if
at
any
time
he
found
himself
in
hard
straits
and
needed
heavenly
aid
and
was
out
of
red
chinese
candles
he
applied
to
the
saints
making
them
great
promises
in
order
to
win
their
favor
and
convince
them
of
his
good
intentions
captain
tiago
was
therefore
beloved
by
the
priests
respected
by
the
sacristans
fondled
by
the
chinese
and
merchants
and
thoroughly
happy
in
the
religion
of
the
world
some
even
attributed
to
him
great
influence
in
the
ecclesiastical
court
that
the
captain
was
at
peace
with
the
government
must
not
be
doubted
simply
because
such
a
thing
seems
impossible
incapable
of
conceiving
a
new
idea
and
content
with
the
modus
vivendi
he
was
always
willing
to
obey
the
latest
official
recruit
in
any
of
the
government
offices
and
even
ready
to
give
him
at
all
times
of
the
year
such
presents
as
hams
capons
turkeys
and
chinese
fruit
he
was
the
first
to
applaud
any
tax
imposed
by
the
government
especially
when
he
scented
behind
it
a
chance
of
securing
the
contract
for
its
collection
he
always
kept
orchestras
on
hand
to
serenade
government
officials
of
all
grades
from
governor
to
the
lowest
government
agent
on
their
birthdays
saint
days
or
when
any
occasion
such
as
the
death
of
any
of
their
relatives
or
a
birth
in
the
family
connection
should
afford
a
pretext
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
dedicate
laudatory
verses
to
his
royal
patrons
on
these
occasions
thus
honoring
the
suave
and
loving
governor
or
the
valiant
and
mighty
alcalde
the
captain
was
a
petty
governor
or
gobernadorcillo
of
a
rich
colony
of
mestizos
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
many
who
considered
him
unfit
for
the
position
he
held
the
office
for
two
years
but
during
this
time
he
wore
out
ten
frock
coats
about
the
same
number
of
high
hats
and
lost
more
than
a
half
dozen
of
gobernadorcillo
canes
his
high
hat
and
frock
coat
were
always
in
evidence
in
the
city
hall
at
the
government
palace
in
melacañan
and
at
the
army
headquarters
and
they
always
appeared
too
in
the
in
the
market
in
all
processions
and
in
the
chinese
shops
dressed
in
this
official
costume
with
the
tasseled
cane
captain
tiago
was
to
be
found
everywhere
arranging
ordering
and
putting
in
disorder
everything
with
which
he
had
anything
to
do
and
all
with
wonderful
activity
and
with
still
more
wonderful
gravity
sacrilegious
people
called
him
a
fool
poor
people
called
him
a
hypocrite
a
cruel
man
who
gained
a
livelihood
by
making
others
miserable
while
his
inferiors
looked
upon
him
as
a
despot
and
a
tyrant
and
the
women
ah
the
women
slanderous
rumors
circulated
in
the
wretched
nipa
houses
and
it
was
claimed
that
often
lamentations
and
sobs
mingled
with
the
cries
of
a
child
could
be
heard
more
than
one
young
girl
was
pointed
out
by
the
malicious
finger
of
the
neighbors
with
the
remark
see
what
a
different
expression
she
wears
and
how
plainly
she
shows
evidences
of
her
shame
but
such
things
as
these
never
robbed
the
captain
of
any
sleep
no
young
girl
disturbed
his
rest
such
was
the
captain
at
that
time
his
past
history
was
as
follows
he
was
the
only
son
of
a
very
wealthy
but
avaricious
sugar
manufacturer
of
malabon
who
was
unwilling
to
spend
a
cent
in
his
education
for
this
reason
young
santiago
became
the
servant
of
a
good
dominican
a
very
virtuous
man
who
tried
to
teach
him
all
the
valuable
knowledge
which
he
possessed
about
the
time
when
he
was
to
have
the
happiness
of
studying
logic
the
death
of
his
protector
followed
by
that
of
his
father
put
an
end
to
his
studies
and
from
that
time
on
he
devoted
himself
to
business
he
married
a
beautiful
girl
from
santa
cruz
who
increased
his
fortune
and
gave
him
a
social
position
doña
pia
alba
was
not
content
with
buying
sugar
coffee
and
indigo
she
wished
to
sow
and
reap
so
the
young
husband
bought
lands
in
san
diego
it
was
in
this
town
that
he
made
the
acquaintance
and
friendship
of
father
dámaso
and
of
don
rafael
ibarra
the
richest
capitalist
of
the
town
the
lack
of
an
heir
for
the
first
six
years
of
his
married
life
gave
him
a
great
opportunity
to
accumulate
wealth
which
perhaps
was
a
censurable
ambition
although
doña
pia
was
handsome
robust
and
well
formed
she
made
her
pilgrimages
in
vain
by
advice
of
the
devotees
of
san
diego
she
visited
the
virgin
of
cayasay
in
taal
she
gave
alms
and
she
danced
in
the
procession
before
the
virgin
of
turumba
in
pakil
under
the
may
sun
but
it
was
all
in
vain
finally
on
the
advice
of
father
dámaso
she
went
to
obando
and
there
danced
at
the
fiesta
of
san
pascual
bailon
and
asked
for
a
son
it
is
well
known
that
in
obando
there
is
a
trinity
our
lady
of
salambau
santa
clara
and
san
pascual
which
grants
sons
or
daughters
as
required
thanks
to
this
wise
triumvirate
doña
pia
became
a
mother
but
like
the
fisherman
in
macbeth
who
ceased
to
sing
after
he
found
a
rich
treasure
doña
pia
lost
her
gayety
became
very
sad
and
was
never
seen
to
smile
again
every
one
even
to
captain
tiago
declared
that
it
was
a
pure
caprice
a
puerperal
fever
put
an
end
to
her
grief
leaving
a
beautiful
daughter
motherless
father
dámaso
baptized
the
child
and
as
san
pascual
had
not
given
the
son
which
had
been
asked
for
the
name
of
maria
clara
was
given
to
it
in
honor
of
the
virgin
of
salambau
and
of
santa
clara
the
little
girl
grew
up
under
the
care
of
her
aunt
isabel
that
good
old
lady
with
the
manners
of
a
friar
whom
we
met
before
the
little
girl
lived
the
greater
part
of
the
time
in
san
diego
on
account
of
the
healthful
climate
and
while
there
father
dámaso
paid
her
much
attention
maria
clara
did
not
have
the
small
eyes
of
her
father
like
her
mother
her
eyes
were
large
black
and
shaded
by
long
lashes
brilliant
and
smiling
when
she
was
playing
but
sad
deep
and
pensive
at
other
times
when
a
child
her
wavy
hair
was
almost
blond
her
nose
was
well
formed
neither
too
large
nor
too
flat
her
mouth
was
small
and
beautifully
shaped
like
that
of
her
mother
and
her
cheeks
were
set
with
dimples
her
skin
was
like
silk
and
as
white
as
snow
but
her
fond
parent
found
traces
of
the
paternity
of
captain
tiago
in
her
small
and
well
shaped
ears
aunt
isabel
attributed
the
child
features
to
impressions
made
upon
doña
pia
she
remembered
having
seen
the
mother
a
short
time
before
the
child
was
born
weeping
before
the
image
of
san
antonio
then
too
a
cousin
of
captain
tiago
had
the
same
features
the
only
difference
being
in
the
choice
of
the
saints
by
which
the
phenomenon
was
explained
with
her
it
was
either
the
virgin
or
san
miguel
a
cousin
of
captain
tiago
a
famous
philosopher
who
knew
amat
by
heart
explained
it
all
by
attributing
it
to
the
effect
of
the
planets
maria
clara
the
idol
of
all
grew
up
surrounded
by
love
and
smiles
she
won
the
favor
of
even
the
friars
when
she
was
dressed
in
white
for
some
religious
procession
her
long
wavy
hair
interwoven
with
flowers
two
silver
or
golden
wings
attached
to
the
shoulders
of
her
dress
and
holding
two
white
doves
tied
with
blue
ribbons
in
her
hand
when
she
grew
up
she
was
so
full
of
childish
mischief
that
captain
tiago
did
nothing
but
bless
the
saints
of
obando
and
advise
everybody
to
buy
handsome
statues
of
that
trinity
in
tropical
countries
a
girl
becomes
a
woman
at
the
age
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
like
the
plant
which
buds
at
night
and
blooms
the
following
morning
during
this
period
of
transition
so
full
of
mystery
and
romance
on
the
advice
of
the
parish
priest
maria
clara
entered
the
religious
retreat
of
santa
catalina
in
order
to
receive
from
the
nuns
a
strictly
religious
education
she
left
father
dámaso
in
tears
and
likewise
the
only
friend
of
her
childhood
crisostomo
ibarra
shortly
after
the
entrance
to
the
convent
ibarra
went
to
europe
for
seven
long
years
the
girl
lived
under
the
vigilance
of
the
mother
superior
in
the
building
shut
off
from
any
communication
with
the
outer
world
don
rafael
and
captain
tiago
in
the
meantime
while
ibarra
was
in
europe
and
maria
clara
in
the
convent
noticing
the
trend
of
affairs
and
at
the
same
time
having
in
mind
their
own
interests
decided
that
the
children
should
be
married
it
is
needless
to
say
that
this
agreement
which
was
arrived
at
some
years
after
ibarra
had
left
for
europe
was
celebrated
with
equal
joy
by
two
hearts
on
opposite
sides
of
the
world
and
amid
very
different
surroundings
chapter
v
an
idyl
on
the
azotea
on
the
morning
after
the
dinner
party
aunt
isabel
and
maria
clara
went
to
mass
early
the
former
carefully
carrying
her
glasses
so
that
she
might
be
able
to
read
the
anchor
of
salvation
during
communion
the
latter
beautifully
dressed
carrying
her
rosary
of
blue
beads
as
a
bracelet
the
priest
had
scarcely
left
the
altar
when
to
the
disgust
and
surprise
of
her
good
aunt
who
thought
that
her
niece
was
as
pious
and
as
fond
of
prayer
as
a
nun
the
young
girl
desired
to
go
home
after
a
great
deal
of
grumbling
the
old
lady
crossed
herself
several
times
and
the
two
arose
to
leave
never
mind
said
maria
to
cut
off
the
scolding
the
good
god
will
pardon
me
he
ought
to
understand
the
heart
of
a
girl
better
than
you
aunt
isabel
after
breakfast
maria
clara
occupied
herself
with
some
embroidery
while
her
aunt
bustled
about
with
a
duster
removing
the
traces
of
the
social
event
of
the
preceding
evening
captain
tiago
was
busy
examining
some
papers
every
noise
in
the
street
and
every
passing
carriage
made
the
girl
tremble
with
anxiety
and
wish
that
she
were
again
back
in
the
convent
among
her
friends
there
she
thought
she
could
see
him
without
trembling
and
with
perfect
equanimity
i
believe
maria
that
the
doctor
is
right
said
captain
tiago
you
ought
to
go
to
the
provinces
you
are
looking
very
pale
and
need
a
change
of
air
how
does
malabon
strike
you
or
san
diego
at
the
mere
mention
of
the
latter
name
maria
clara
blushed
and
was
unable
to
speak
now
you
and
isabel
go
to
the
convent
to
get
your
things
and
say
good
bye
to
your
friends
continued
the
captain
without
raising
his
head
you
will
not
return
there
and
in
four
or
five
days
when
your
clothes
are
ready
we
shall
go
to
malabon
your
godfather
by
the
way
is
not
in
san
diego
at
present
the
priest
whom
you
saw
here
last
night
that
young
fellow
is
now
the
priest
in
the
town
he
is
a
saint
i
think
you
will
find
san
diego
better
cousin
said
aunt
isabel
our
house
there
is
better
than
the
one
in
malabon
and
besides
it
is
nearly
time
for
the
fiesta
to
take
place
maria
clara
was
about
to
embrace
her
aunt
for
these
welcome
words
but
just
then
a
carriage
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
and
the
young
girl
suddenly
turned
pale
that
so
said
the
captain
and
then
in
a
changed
tone
exclaimed
don
crisostomo
maria
clara
let
fall
the
work
which
she
was
holding
in
her
hands
a
nervous
trembling
passed
over
her
then
steps
were
heard
on
the
stairs
and
presently
a
young
manly
voice
and
as
if
this
voice
had
some
magic
power
the
girl
shook
off
her
emotion
started
to
run
and
hid
herself
in
the
oratory
both
father
and
aunt
had
to
laugh
at
this
and
even
ibarra
heard
the
closing
of
the
door
behind
her
pale
and
panting
the
girl
finally
subdued
her
emotion
and
began
to
listen
she
could
hear
his
voice
that
voice
which
for
so
long
a
time
she
had
heard
only
in
her
dreams
beside
herself
with
joy
she
kissed
the
nearest
saint
which
by
the
way
happened
to
be
san
antonio
the
abbot
happy
saint
whether
alive
or
carved
in
wood
always
tempted
in
the
most
charming
manner
becoming
quite
herself
again
she
looked
about
for
some
crack
through
which
she
might
get
a
peep
at
the
young
man
finally
when
he
came
in
range
of
the
and
she
again
saw
his
fine
features
her
face
beamed
with
smiles
in
fact
the
sight
filled
her
with
such
joy
that
when
her
aunt
came
to
call
her
maria
clara
fell
on
the
old
lady
neck
and
kissed
her
repeatedly
you
goose
what
is
the
matter
with
you
the
old
lady
was
finally
able
to
ask
after
wiping
away
her
tears
maria
clara
in
her
modesty
covered
her
face
with
her
round
arm
come
hurry
up
and
get
yourself
ready
said
the
old
lady
in
an
affectionate
tone
while
he
is
talking
with
your
father
about
you
come
do
not
waste
time
the
girl
did
not
respond
but
allowed
herself
to
be
picked
up
like
a
child
and
carried
to
her
room
captain
tiago
and
ibarra
were
talking
earnestly
when
at
last
aunt
isabel
appeared
half
dragging
her
niece
by
the
hand
at
first
the
girl
looked
in
every
direction
but
at
the
persons
present
at
last
however
her
eyes
met
ibarra
the
conversation
of
the
young
lovers
was
at
first
confined
to
the
usual
trifling
remarks
those
pleasant
little
things
which
like
the
boasts
of
european
nations
are
enjoyable
and
interesting
to
those
who
are
concerned
and
understand
them
but
ridiculous
to
outsiders
finally
she
like
all
sisters
of
cain
was
moved
by
jealously
and
asked
have
you
always
thought
of
me
have
you
never
forgotten
me
in
your
many
travels
among
so
many
great
cities
and
among
such
beautiful
women
and
he
a
true
brother
of
cain
dodged
the
issue
and
being
something
of
a
diplomat
answered
could
i
forget
you
and
then
gazing
into
her
deep
dark
eyes
could
i
break
a
sacred
vow
do
you
remember
that
stormy
night
when
you
seeing
me
in
tears
beside
my
dead
mother
came
to
me
and
placed
your
hand
that
hand
which
i
have
not
touched
for
so
long
upon
my
shoulder
and
said
have
lost
your
mother
i
never
had
one
and
then
you
wept
with
me
you
loved
my
mother
and
she
loved
you
as
only
a
mother
can
love
a
daughter
it
was
raining
then
you
will
remember
and
the
lightning
flashed
but
i
seemed
to
hear
music
and
to
see
a
smile
on
the
face
of
my
dead
o
if
my
parents
were
only
living
and
could
see
you
now
that
night
i
took
your
hand
and
joining
it
with
my
mother
i
swore
always
to
love
you
and
make
you
happy
no
matter
what
fate
heaven
might
have
in
store
for
me
i
have
never
regretted
that
vow
and
now
renew
it
since
the
day
that
i
bade
you
and
entered
the
convent
she
answered
smiling
i
have
always
remembered
you
and
have
never
forgotten
you
in
spite
of
the
commands
of
my
confessor
who
imposed
severe
penances
on
me
i
remembered
the
little
games
we
used
to
play
together
and
our
little
quarrels
when
we
were
children
you
used
to
find
in
the
river
the
most
beautiful
shells
for
our
games
of
siklot
and
the
finest
and
most
beautifully
colored
stones
for
our
game
of
sinkat
you
were
always
very
slow
and
stupid
and
lost
but
you
always
paid
the
forfeit
which
i
gave
you
with
the
palm
of
my
hand
but
i
always
tried
to
strike
lightly
for
i
was
sorry
for
you
you
always
cheated
even
more
than
i
in
the
game
of
chouka
and
we
generally
quarrelled
over
it
do
you
remember
that
time
when
you
really
became
angry
then
you
made
me
suffer
but
when
i
found
that
i
had
no
one
to
quarrel
with
we
made
peace
immediately
we
were
still
children
when
we
went
with
your
mother
one
day
to
bathe
in
the
stream
under
the
shade
of
the
reeds
many
flowers
and
plants
grew
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
you
used
to
tell
me
their
strange
latin
and
spanish
names
for
you
were
then
studying
at
the
athenæum
i
paid
little
attention
but
amused
myself
by
chasing
butterflies
and
in
trying
to
catch
the
little
fish
which
slipped
away
from
me
so
easily
among
the
rocks
and
weeds
of
the
shore
you
suddenly
disappeared
from
sight
but
when
you
returned
you
brought
a
wreath
of
orange
flowers
and
placed
it
on
my
head
on
our
way
home
as
the
sun
was
hot
i
collected
some
sage
leaves
from
the
side
of
the
road
for
you
to
put
into
your
hat
and
thus
prevent
headache
then
you
laughed
we
made
up
and
came
the
remainder
of
the
way
home
hand
in
hand
ibarra
smiled
as
he
listened
attentively
to
every
detail
of
the
story
opening
his
pocket
book
he
took
out
a
paper
in
which
he
had
wrapped
some
withered
but
fragrant
sage
leaves
your
sage
leaves
said
he
in
answer
to
her
questioning
glance
the
only
thing
you
have
ever
given
me
she
in
turn
drew
a
little
white
satin
bag
from
the
bosom
of
her
dress
stop
she
said
tapping
his
hand
with
her
own
you
must
not
touch
it
it
is
a
letter
of
farewell
the
one
that
i
wrote
you
before
leaving
my
dear
sir
have
you
ever
written
any
other
and
what
did
i
say
then
many
falsehoods
excuses
of
a
bad
debtor
replied
she
smiling
and
showing
how
agreeable
these
falsehoods
had
been
to
her
but
be
quiet
i
will
read
it
to
you
but
i
will
omit
your
polite
speeches
out
of
consideration
for
your
feelings
raising
the
paper
to
the
height
of
her
eyes
in
order
to
conceal
her
face
she
began
i
shall
not
read
you
what
follows
that
for
it
is
not
true
she
ran
her
eyes
over
some
lines
and
began
to
read
again
father
wishes
me
to
go
away
in
spite
of
my
entreaties
he
says
that
i
am
a
man
and
must
think
of
my
future
and
my
duty
that
i
must
learn
how
to
live
which
i
can
not
do
in
my
own
country
so
that
in
the
future
i
may
be
of
some
use
he
says
that
if
i
remain
at
his
side
in
his
shadow
in
this
atmosphere
of
business
i
will
never
learn
how
to
look
ahead
and
that
when
he
is
gone
i
shall
be
like
the
plant
of
which
our
poet
baltazar
speaks
as
it
always
lives
in
the
water
it
never
learns
how
to
endure
a
moment
he
reproached
me
because
i
wept
and
his
reproach
hurt
me
so
that
i
confessed
that
i
loved
you
my
father
stopped
thought
a
moment
and
placing
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
said
in
a
trembling
voice
do
you
think
that
you
alone
know
how
to
love
that
your
father
does
not
love
you
and
that
his
heart
is
not
pained
at
being
separated
from
you
it
is
a
short
time
since
your
mother
died
and
i
am
already
reaching
that
age
when
the
help
and
counsel
of
youth
are
needed
and
yet
i
consent
to
your
going
not
even
knowing
that
i
shall
ever
see
you
again
the
future
is
opening
to
you
but
closing
to
me
your
loves
are
being
born
mine
are
dying
fire
blazes
in
your
blood
but
cold
is
gradually
finding
its
way
into
mine
and
yet
you
weep
and
are
not
willing
to
sacrifice
the
present
for
a
future
useful
to
yourself
and
your
country
the
eyes
of
my
father
filled
with
tears
and
i
fell
upon
my
knees
at
his
feet
and
embraced
him
i
asked
his
pardon
and
said
that
i
was
willing
to
go
the
emotion
which
ibarra
manifested
put
an
end
to
the
reading
as
pale
as
death
he
arose
and
began
to
walk
nervously
from
one
side
to
the
other
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
you
have
made
me
forget
that
i
have
duties
to
perform
and
that
i
ought
to
leave
immediately
for
my
town
is
the
fiesta
in
memory
of
the
dead
maria
clara
stopped
and
silently
fixed
her
large
and
dreamy
eyes
upon
him
for
some
minutes
then
taking
some
flowers
from
a
vase
near
by
she
said
with
emotion
go
i
do
not
wish
to
detain
you
we
shall
see
each
other
again
in
a
few
days
place
these
flowers
on
the
graves
of
your
father
and
mother
a
few
moments
later
ibarra
descended
the
stairs
accompanied
by
captain
tiago
and
doña
isabel
while
maria
clara
locked
herself
up
in
the
oratory
do
me
the
favor
to
tell
andeng
to
get
the
house
ready
and
that
maria
and
isabel
are
coming
a
pleasant
journey
while
the
captain
was
saying
this
ibarra
got
into
the
carriage
and
drove
off
in
the
direction
of
the
plaza
of
san
gabriel
a
few
minutes
later
the
captain
shouted
to
maria
clara
who
was
weeping
by
the
side
of
the
image
of
the
virgin
hurry
up
and
light
two
peseta
candles
in
honor
of
san
roque
and
another
in
honor
of
san
rafael
the
patron
saint
of
travellers
and
light
the
lamp
of
our
lady
of
peace
and
protector
of
travellers
for
there
are
many

about
it
is
better
to
spend
four
reales
for
wax
and
six
cuartos
for
oil
than
to
have
to
pay
a
big
ransom
later
on
chapter
vi
things
philippine
father
dámaso
drove
up
in
front
of
captain
tiago
house
and
the
franciscan
stepped
to
the
ground
just
as
aunt
isabel
and
maria
clara
were
getting
into
their
carriage
they
saluted
father
dámaso
and
he
in
his
preoccupation
gently
patted
maria
clara
on
the
cheek
where
are
you
going
the
friar
asked
to
the
convent
to
get
my
things
replied
the
younger
ah
ha
ah
ha
we
see
who
is
the
stronger
we
see
he
muttered
and
turned
away
leaving
the
two
women
in
wonder
as
to
what
it
all
meant
the
friar
stepped
along
lightly
and
reaching
the
stairs
went
up
he
must
be
studying
his
sermon
said
isabel
get
in
maria
we
shall
be
late
whether
father
dámaso
was
studying
his
sermon
or
not
we
can
not
say
at
any
rate
he
was
absorbed
in
some
important
matter
for
he
even
forgot
to
extend
his
hand
to
captain
tiago
upon
entering
greatly
to
the
embarrassment
of
the
captain
who
had
to
feign
kissing
it
santiago
we
have
some
very
important
matters
to
talk
over
let
us
go
to
your
office
the
captain
somewhat
disturbed
was
unable
to
reply
but
he
obeyed
and
followed
the
big
priest
into
his
office
father
dámaso
shut
the
door
behind
them
while
they
are
conferring
in
secret
let
us
find
out
what
has
become
of
brother
sibyla
the
wise
dominican
was
not
to
be
found
at
his
parochial
residence
for
early
immediately
after
mass
he
had
gone
to
the
dominican
convent
situated
near
the
gate
called
isabel
the
second
or
magallanes
according
to
which
family
is
in
power
in
madrid
paying
no
attention
to
the
delicious
odor
of
chocolate
or
to
the
rattling
of
money
boxes
and
coins
in
the
treasurer
office
and
scarcely
answering
the
deferential
salute
of
the
treasurer
father
sibyla
went
upstairs
crossed
several
corridors
and
rapped
on
a
door
come
in
answered
a
voice
may
god
give
back
health
to
your
reverence
was
the
greeting
of
the
young
dominican
as
he
entered
a
very
feeble
old
priest
was
seated
in
a
large
his
complexion
was
as
yellow
as
the
saints
which
revera
paints
his
eyes
were
sunk
deep
in
their
orbits
and
his
heavy
eyebrows
which
were
nearly
always
knit
in
a
frown
added
to
the
brilliant
glare
of
his
eyes
i
have
come
to
talk
to
you
about
the
charge
with
which
you
have
entrusted
me
said
father
sibyla
ah
yes
and
what
about
it
pshaw
answered
the
young
man
with
disgust
seating
himself
and
turning
his
face
away
with
disdain
they
have
been
telling
us
a
lot
of
lies
young
ibarra
is
a
prudent
boy
he
does
not
seem
to
be
a
fool
i
think
he
is
a
pretty
good
sort
of
a
chap
do
you
think
so
hostilities
began
last
night
so
soon
and
how
did
it
come
about
father
sibyla
related
briefly
what
had
taken
place
between
father
dámaso
and
crisostomo
ibarra
furthermore
he
added
in
conclusion
the
young
man
is
going
to
marry
that
daughter
of
captain
tiago
who
was
educated
in
the
college
of
our
sisters
he
is
rich
and
would
not
want
to
make
any
enemies
who
might
cause
the
loss
of
his
happiness
and
his
fortune
the
sick
man
bowed
his
head
as
a
sign
of
assent
yes
that
is
my
opinion
with
such
a
wife
and
such
a
we
can
hold
him
body
and
soul
and
if
not
it
will
be
all
the
better
for
us
if
he
declares
himself
our
enemy
father
sibyla
looked
at
the
old
man
with
surprise
that
is
to
say
for
the
good
of
our
whole
corporation
he
added
breathing
with
difficulty
i
prefer
open
attacks
to
the
foolish
praise
and
adulations
of
friends
for
the
truth
is
flattery
is
always
paid
for
does
your
reverence
think
so
the
old
man
looked
at
him
sadly
always
bear
this
in
mind
he
answered
panting
with
fatigue
that
our
power
will
endure
as
long
as
it
is
believed
in
if
they
attack
us
the
government
says
attack
them
because
they
see
in
them
an
obstacle
to
their
liberty
therefore
let
us
preserve
them
and
if
the
government
gives
them
a
hearing
sometimes
the
government
the
government
will
do
no
such
thing
nevertheless
if
some
bold
and
reckless
man
impelled
by
covetousness
should
dare
to
think
that
he
wanted
our
possessions
then
woe
to
him
for
a
moment
both
remained
silent
furthermore
continued
the
sick
man
it
will
do
us
good
to
have
them
attack
us
and
wake
us
up
it
would
show
us
our
weaknesses
and
strengthen
us
the
exaggerated
praises
which
we
get
deceive
us
and
put
us
asleep
we
are
becoming
ridiculous
and
on
the
day
that
we
become
ridiculous
we
shall
fall
as
we
fell
in
europe
money
will
no
longer
flow
into
our
churches
no
one
will
longer
buy
our
scapularies
or
girdles
and
when
we
cease
to
be
rich
we
shall
no
longer
possess
the
great
influence
which
we
wield
at
present
pshaw
we
shall
always
have
our
property
our
plantations
we
shall
lose
them
all
as
we
lost
them
in
europe
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
we
are
working
for
our
own
ruin
for
instance
this
immeasurable
ambition
to
raise
the
incomes
from
our
lands
each
year
this
eagerness
to
increase
the
rents
which
i
have
always
opposed
in
vain
this
eagerness
will
be
our
ruin
the
natives
already
find
themselves
forced
to
buy
land
in
other
localities
if
they
want
lands
as
good
as
ours
i
fear
that
we
are
degenerating
the
gods
would
destroy
they
first
make
mad
for
this
reason
we
should
not
be
too
hard
on
the
people
for
they
are
already
grumbling
under
our
exactions
you
have
considered
well
let
us
leave
this
thing
to
others
and
keep
up
the
prestige
which
we
have
and
let
us
endeavor
to
appear
before
god
with
clean
hands
may
the
god
of
pity
have
mercy
on
our
weaknesses
so
you
believe
that
the
tax
or
tribute
let
us
talk
no
more
of
money
interrupted
the
sick
man
with
disgust
you
were
saying
that
the
lieutenant
and
father
dámaso
last
night
yes
father
answered
the
young
priest
smiling
but
this
morning
i
saw
the
lieutenant
again
and
he
told
me
that
he
was
sorry
for
what
had
occurred
at
the
dinner
he
said
he
thought
that
he
had
been
affected
by
too
much
wine
and
that
the
same
was
true
of
father
dámaso
your
boast
to
tell
the
governor
i
asked
jokingly
he
answered
know
when
to
make
my
word
good
so
long
as
it
does
not
stain
my
honor
that
is
just
the
reason
why
i
wear
only
two
stars
after
talking
over
several
minor
matters
father
sibyla
took
his
leave
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
lieutenant
had
not
gone
to
the
governor
general
palace
in
melacañan
with
any
report
in
regard
to
the
occurrence
of
the
preceding
evening
however
the
governor
general
had
learned
of
it
through
another
source
and
discussing
the
matter
with
one
of
his
aides
he
said
a
woman
and
a
priest
can
give
no
offense
i
intend
to
live
peaceably
while
i
remain
in
this
country
and
i
do
not
wish
to
have
any
trouble
with
men
who
wear
skirts
and
furthermore
i
have
found
out
that
the
father
provincial
has
evaded
my
orders
in
this
matter
i
asked
for
the
removal
of
that
friar
as
a
punishment
what
was
done
they
removed
him
but
they
gave
him
another
and
much
better
town
of
the
friars
as
they
say
in
spain
but
when
his
excellency
found
himself
alone
he
ceased
to
smile
ah
he
sighed
if
the
people
were
not
so
stupid
they
would
put
a
limit
to
their
reverences
but
every
people
deserves
its
fate
and
we
are
no
different
in
this
respect
from
the
rest
of
the
world
meanwhile
captain
tiago
had
concluded
his
conference
with
father
dámaso
or
rather
father
dámaso
had
concluded
it
i
have
already
warned
you
said
the
franciscan
on
taking
his
leave
you
could
have
avoided
all
of
this
had
you
consulted
with
me
before
and
if
you
had
not
lied
to
me
when
i
asked
you
about
it
see
to
it
that
you
do
not
do
any
more
such
foolish
things
and
have
faith
in
your
godfather
captain
tiago
took
two
or
three
steps
towards
the
sala
meditating
and
sighing
all
at
once
as
if
some
good
idea
had
struck
him
he
ran
to
the
oratory
and
put
out
the
candles
and
the
lamps
which
had
been
lighted
for
ibarra
protection
there
is
still
time
enough
he
murmured
for
he
has
a
long
road
to
travel
chapter
vii
san
diego
and
its
people
not
far
from
the
shores
of
the
laguna
de
bay
lies
the
town
of
san
diego
surrounded
by
fertile
fields
and
rice
plantations
it
exports
sugar
rice
coffee
and
fruits
or
sells
them
at
ridiculously
low
prices
to
the
chinese
who
make
large
profits
out
of
the
credulity
and
vices
of
the
laborers
when
the
sky
was
serene
and
the
atmosphere
clear
the
boys
used
to
climb
to
the
very
peak
of
the
old
moss
and
vine
covered
church
tower
and
what
exclamations
they
would
utter
when
from
that
high
pinnacle
they
looked
out
at
the
beautiful
panorama
that
surrounded
them
there
before
them
lay
a
great
mass
of
roofs
some
nipa
some
thatch
some
zinc
and
some
made
out
of
the
native
grasses
and
out
of
that
mass
which
here
and
there
gave
way
to
an
orchard
or
a
garden
every
one
of
those
boys
could
find
his
own
little
home
his
own
little
nest
to
them
everything
was
a
landmark
every
tamarind
tree
with
its
light
foliage
every
cocoanut
tree
with
its
load
of
nuts
every
bending
cane
every
bonga
tree
every
cross
beyond
the
town
is
the
crystal
river
like
a
serpent
asleep
on
a
carpet
of
green
here
and
there
its
tranquil
surface
is
broken
by
rocks
projecting
from
its
sandy
bottom
in
places
it
is
hemmed
in
between
two
high
banks
and
there
the
rapidly
rushing
waters
turn
and
twist
the
roots
of
the
overhanging
shade
trees
but
further
on
it
spreads
itself
out
again
and
becomes
calm
and
peaceful
but
what
always
attracts
attention
is
a
peninsula
of
forest
projecting
into
this
sea
of
cultivated
land
there
can
be
found
trees
a
century
old
trees
which
die
only
when
struck
by
lightning
and
set
on
fire
they
say
also
that
even
in
that
case
the
fire
never
spreads
to
any
other
tree
this
old
grove
is
held
in
a
certain
degree
of
awe
for
around
it
have
been
woven
many
strange
legends
of
these
the
most
probable
and
consequently
the
least
known
and
believed
is
the
following
when
the
town
was
still
a
miserable
group
of
huts
when
weeds
grew
in
abundance
in
the
streets
and
deer
and
wild
boar
roamed
about
at
night
there
arrived
one
day
an
old
spaniard
his
eyes
were
deep
and
thoughtful
and
he
spoke
tagalog
fluently
after
visiting
the
different
estates
and
peddling
out
some
goods
he
inquired
for
the
owners
of
this
grove
which
by
the
way
also
contained
several
hot
water
springs
a
number
of
persons
claiming
to
be
the
owners
presented
themselves
and
the
old
man
purchased
from
them
the
grove
paying
in
exchange
some
money
jewelry
and
clothing
a
short
time
afterward
he
disappeared
no
one
knew
where
his
sudden
disappearance
made
the
people
think
for
a
time
that
he
had
been
spirited
away
but
later
on
a
fetid
odor
was
noticeable
near
the
grove
and
some
shepherds
upon
investigation
found
the
body
of
the
old
man
in
a
badly
decomposed
condition
hanging
from
the
limb
of
a
balitî
tree
when
alive
the
old
man
had
terrorized
many
by
his
deep
and
resonant
voice
his
sunken
eyes
and
his
silent
laugh
but
now
that
he
was
dead
and
a
suicide
at
that
the
mere
mention
of
his
name
gave
the
town
women
nightmare
some
of
them
threw
the
jewelry
that
they
had
bought
from
him
into
the
river
and
burned
all
the
clothing
and
for
a
long
time
after
the
body
had
been
buried
at
the
foot
of
the
balitî
tree
no
one
cared
to
venture
near
it
all
sort
of
stories
became
current
about
the
haunted
place
a
shepherd
looking
for
his
flock
said
that
he
had
seen
lights
in
the
grove
a
party
of
young
men
passing
near
the
place
heard
groans
and
lamentations
an
unfortunate
lover
in
order
to
make
an
impression
on
the
disdainful
object
of
his
affections
promised
to
spend
a
night
under
the
tree
and
to
bring
her
a
branch
from
its
trunk
but
on
the
next
day
he
was
taken
ill
with
a
quick
fever
and
died
before
many
months
had
passed
a
youth
came
to
the
town
one
day
he
was
apparently
a
spanish
mestizo
declared
himself
the
son
of
the
dead
stranger
and
established
himself
in
that
corner
of
the
world
he
began
to
farm
the
land
and
devoted
himself
especially
to
the
cultivation
of
indigo
don
saturnino
was
a
taciturn
young
man
violent
and
sometimes
cruel
but
very
active
and
industrious
he
built
a
wall
around
his
father
grave
and
from
time
to
time
went
all
alone
to
visit
it
a
few
years
later
he
married
a
young
girl
from
manila
who
bore
him
a
son
rafael
the
father
of
crisostomo
don
rafael
from
his
earliest
youth
was
fond
of
farming
under
his
care
the
agriculture
which
had
been
started
and
fostered
by
his
father
was
rapidly
developed
new
inhabitants
flocked
to
the
vicinity
and
among
them
were
a
great
many
chinese
the
village
grew
very
fast
and
was
soon
supporting
a
native
priest
after
it
had
become
a
pueblo
the
native
priest
died
and
father
dámaso
took
his
place
still
the
grave
and
the
adjoining
lands
were
respected
at
times
children
armed
with
sticks
and
stones
ventured
to
wander
about
exploring
the
surrounding
country
and
gathering
guayabas
papays
lomboy
and
other
native
fruits
then
all
of
a
sudden
while
they
were
busily
engaged
collecting
the
fruits
some
one
would
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
old
rope
hanging
from
the
balitî
tree
and
stones
would
be
heard
to
fall
then
some
one
would
cry
the
old
man
the
old
man
dropping
fruit
sticks
and
stones
and
leaping
from
the
trees
the
boys
would
flee
in
all
directions
through
the
thickets
and
between
the
rocks
not
stopping
until
they
emerged
from
the
grove
pale
and
panting
some
laughing
some
crying
you
could
not
say
that
don
rafael
while
alive
was
the
most
influential
man
in
san
diego
although
it
is
true
that
he
was
the
richest
owned
the
most
land
and
had
put
almost
everybody
else
under
obligations
to
him
he
was
modest
and
always
belittled
his
own
deeds
he
never
tried
to
form
a
party
of
his
own
and
as
we
have
already
seen
no
one
came
to
his
aid
when
his
fortune
seemed
to
fail
him
whenever
captain
tiago
arrived
in
town
his
debtors
received
him
with
an
orchestra
gave
him
a
banquet
and
loaded
him
down
with
gifts
if
a
deer
or
a
wild
boar
was
caught
he
always
had
a
quarter
of
it
for
his
own
table
if
any
of
his
debtors
found
a
beautiful
horse
within
a
half
hour
it
would
be
in
the
captain
stable
all
of
this
is
true
but
still
when
the
captain
had
his
back
turned
they
made
fun
of
him
and
referred
to
him
as
sacristan
tiago
the
gobernadorcillo
was
an
unhappy
fellow
who
never
commanded
but
always
obeyed
he
never
attacked
any
one
but
was
always
attacked
he
never
ordered
anybody
but
everybody
ordered
him
and
besides
he
had
to
take
the
responsibility
for
everything
that
they
had
commanded
ordered
or
disposed
the
position
had
cost
him
five
thousand
pesos
and
many
humiliations
but
considering
the
profits
he
made
the
price
was
very
cheap
san
diego
was
like
rome
not
the
rome
of
the
time
of
romulus
when
he
marked
out
the
walls
with
a
plough
nor
when
later
he
bathed
in
his
own
blood
and
that
of
others
and
dictated
laws
to
the
world
no
san
diego
was
like
the
rome
of
contemporaneous
history
with
this
difference
instead
of
being
a
city
of
marble
monuments
and
coliseums
it
was
a
city
of
saualî
and
the
parochial
priest
of
san
diego
corresponded
to
the
pope
in
the
vatican
the
alferez
of
the
civil
guard
to
the
king
of
italy
in
the
quirinal
but
both
in
the
same
proportion
as
the
sauali
or
native
wood
and
the
nipa
corresponded
to
the
monuments
of
marble
and
coliseums
and
in
san
diego
as
in
rome
there
was
continual
trouble
everybody
wanted
to
be
the
leading
señor
and
there
was
always
some
one
else
in
the
way
let
us
describe
two
of
these
ambitious
citizens
friar
bernando
salvi
was
the
young
and
silent
franciscan
whom
we
mentioned
in
a
preceding
chapter
he
had
even
more
of
the
customs
and
manners
of
his
brotherhood
than
had
his
predecessor
the
violent
father
dámaso
he
was
slender
sickly
almost
always
pensive
and
very
strict
in
the
fulfillment
of
his
religious
duties
as
well
as
very
careful
of
his
good
name
a
month
after
his
arrival
in
the
parish
almost
all
the
inhabitants
became
brothers
of
the
venerable
third
order
to
the
great
grief
of
its
rival
the
brotherhood
of
the
most
sacred
rosary
his
heart
leaped
with
joy
at
seeing
on
every
neck
in
the
town
from
four
to
five
scapularies
a
knotted
cord
around
every
waist
and
every
funeral
procession
dressed
in
habits
of
guingon
the
sacristan
mayor
or
head
warden
of
the
order
made
quite
a
little
capital
by
selling
and
giving
away
all
those
things
considered
necessary
to
save
the
soul
and
overcome
the
devil
the
only
enemy
of
this
powerful
soul
saver
with
tendencies
in
accord
with
the
times
was
as
we
have
already
stated
the
alferez
the
women
relate
a
story
of
how
the
devil
tried
one
day
to
tempt
father
salvi
and
how
the
latter
caught
him
tied
him
to
the
bed
post
whipped
him
with
a
lash
and
kept
him
tied
fast
for
nine
days
thus
he
had
been
able
to
conquer
the
devil
entirely
as
a
result
any
one
who
persisted
in
being
an
enemy
of
the
priest
was
generally
considered
a
worse
man
than
the
devil
himself
an
honor
which
the
alferez
alone
enjoyed
but
he
merited
this
reputation
he
had
a
wife
an
old
powdered
and
painted
filipino
by
the
name
of
doña
consolación
the
husband
and
several
other
people
called
her
by
a
different
name
but
that
does
not
matter
anyway
the
alferez
was
accustomed
to
drown
the
sorrows
of
unhappy
wedlock
by
getting
as
drunk
as
a
toper
then
when
he
was
thoroughly
intoxicated
he
would
order
his
men
to
drill
in
the
sun
he
himself
remaining
in
the
shade
or
perhaps
he
would
occupy
himself
in
beating
his
wife
when
her
husband
was
dead
drunk
or
was
snoring
away
in
a
siesta
and
doña
consolación
could
not
fight
with
him
then
wearing
a
blue
flannel
shirt
she
would
seat
herself
in
the
window
with
a
cigar
in
her
mouth
she
had
a
dislike
of
children
and
so
from
her
window
she
would
scowl
and
make
faces
at
every
girl
that
passed
the
girls
on
the
other
hand
were
afraid
of
her
and
would
hurry
by
at
a
quick
pace
never
daring
to
raise
their
eyes
or
draw
a
breath
but
say
what
you
may
doña
consolación
had
one
great
virtue
she
was
never
known
to
look
into
a
mirror
these
were
the
leading
people
of
san
diego
toward
the
west
of
san
diego
surrounded
by
rice
fields
lies
a
village
of
the
dead
a
single
narrow
path
dusty
on
dry
days
and
navigable
by
boats
when
it
rains
leads
thither
from
the
town
a
wooden
gate
and
a
fence
half
stone
and
half
bamboo
seem
to
separate
the
cemetery
from
the
people
in
the
town
but
not
from
the
goats
and
sheep
of
the
parochial
priest
of
the
immediate
vicinity
these
animals
go
in
and
out
to
rummage
among
the
tombs
or
to
make
that
solitary
place
glad
with
their
presence
one
day
a
little
old
man
entered
the
cemetery
his
eyes
sparkling
and
his
head
uncovered
upon
seeing
him
many
laughed
while
a
number
of
the
women
knit
their
eyebrows
in
scorn
the
old
man
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
these
manifestations
but
went
directly
toward
a
pile
of
skulls
knelt
down
and
began
to
search
among
the
bones
after
he
had
sorted
over
with
considerable
care
the
skulls
one
by
one
he
drew
his
eyebrows
together
as
though
he
did
not
find
what
he
was
looking
for
moved
his
head
from
side
to
side
looked
in
all
directions
and
finally
got
up
and
went
over
toward
a
eh
there
he
shouted
to
him
the
raised
his
head
do
you
know
where
that
beautiful
skull
is
the
one
white
as
the
meat
of
a
cocoanut
with
a
complete
set
of
teeth
which
i
had
over
there
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
under
those
leaves
the
shrugged
his
shoulders
look
you
added
the
little
old
man
bringing
out
of
his
pocket
a
handful
of
silver
i
have
more
than
that
but
i
will
give
it
to
you
if
you
find
the
skull
for
me
the
glitter
of
the
coin
made
the
reflect
he
looked
over
in
the
direction
of
the
bone
pile
and
said
is
it
over
there
no
then
i
do
know
where
it
is
do
you
know
when
my
debtors
pay
me
i
will
give
you
more
continued
the
old
man
it
was
my
wife
skull
and
if
you
find
it
for
me
is
it
there
then
i
do
know
where
it
is
repeated
the
with
emphasis
but
i
will
give
you
another
you
are
like
the
grave
that
you
are
digging
cried
the
old
man
irritably
you
do
know
the
value
of
what
you
lose
for
whom
is
this
grave
for
a
dead
person
of
course
replied
the
man
like
a
tomb
like
a
tomb
repeated
the
old
man
dryly
you
know
what
you
throw
out
nor
what
you
swallow
dig
dig
at
this
the
old
man
who
was
tasio
the
village
philosopher
turned
and
started
toward
the
gate
in
the
meantime
the
had
finished
his
job
and
two
little
mounds
of
fresh
red
clay
were
piled
on
either
side
of
the
grave
he
took
some
betel
nut
out
of
his
hat
and
began
to
chew
away
looking
with
an
air
of
stupidity
at
everything
within
his
horizon
chapter
viii
ibarra
and
the
just
as
the
old
man
was
leaving
the
cemetery
a
carriage
stopped
at
the
entrance
it
looked
as
though
it
had
made
a
long
journey
the
horses
were
sweating
and
the
vehicle
was
covered
with
dust
ibarra
stepped
out
and
was
followed
by
an
old
servant
he
made
a
gesture
to
the
driver
and
then
turned
down
the
path
into
the
cemetery
he
was
silent
and
grave
my
sickness
and
my
work
have
not
permitted
me
to
return
since
the
day
of
the
funeral
said
the
old
servant
timidly
captain
tiago
said
that
he
would
see
to
it
that
a
niche
was
arranged
for
but
i
planted
some
flowers
on
the
grave
and
erected
a
cross
made
by
my
own
hands
ibarra
did
not
reply
right
there
behind
that
large
cross
señor
continued
the
servant
making
a
gesture
toward
one
of
the
corners
just
as
they
passed
through
the
gate
ibarra
was
so
preoccupied
with
sad
thoughts
that
he
did
not
notice
the
astonishment
which
some
of
the
people
in
the
cemetery
manifested
when
they
saw
him
enter
those
who
were
kneeling
broke
off
their
prayers
and
followed
the
young
man
their
eyes
full
of
curiosity
ibarra
walked
along
very
carefully
and
avoided
stepping
on
the
graves
which
could
be
easily
distinguished
by
the
sunken
ground
in
other
times
he
had
walked
over
them
but
he
respected
them
his
father
lay
in
one
of
them
on
coming
to
the
other
side
of
the
large
cross
he
stopped
and
looked
in
all
directions
his
companion
was
confused
and
out
of
countenance
he
searched
for
marks
on
the
ground
but
could
not
find
the
cross
anywhere
is
it
here
he
murmured
between
his
teeth
no
it
is
over
there
but
the
earth
has
been
removed
ibarra
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
of
anguish
yes
he
continued
i
remember
that
there
was
a
stone
by
the
side
of
the
grave
the
grave
was
a
little
short
a
farm
hand
had
to
dig
it
as
the
was
sick
at
the
time
but
we
will
ask
him
what
he
has
done
with
the
cross
they
turned
toward
the
who
looked
at
them
with
curiosity
he
saluted
them
taking
off
his
hat
can
you
tell
us
which
of
the
graves
over
there
is
the
one
which
had
a
cross
asked
the
servant
the
looked
toward
the
place
and
seemed
to
reflect
a
large
cross
yes
a
large
cross
answered
the
old
man
with
joy
looking
significantly
at
ibarra
whose
face
was
somewhat
animated
an
ornamented
cross
and
fastened
with
reeds
repeated
the
questioning
the
servant
that
it
that
it
yes
yes
like
this
like
this
and
the
servant
traced
an
outline
of
a
byzantine
cross
and
were
there
some
flowers
sown
on
the
grave
adelphas
sampagas
and
pansies
that
it
added
the
servant
delighted
and
offering
the
a
cigar
tell
us
where
the
grave
is
and
where
the
cross
the
scratched
his
ear
and
replied
yawning
well
the
cross
i
have
already
burned
it
up
burned
it
and
why
have
you
burned
it
because
the
head
priest
so
ordered
who
is
the
head
priest
asked
ibarra
who
the
one
who
does
the
whipping
ibarra
put
his
hand
to
his
head
but
you
can
at
least
tell
us
where
the
grave
is
you
ought
to
remember
the
smiled
the
body
is
no
longer
there
he
replied
tranquilly
what
do
you
say
yes
no
longer
the
man
added
in
a
joking
tone
only
a
week
ago
i
buried
a
woman
in
its
place
are
you
crazy
the
servant
asked
why
it
is
not
yet
a
year
since
we
buried
him
then
that
is
the
one
for
it
was
many
months
ago
that
i
took
up
the
body
the
head
priest
of
the
parish
ordered
me
to
do
it
in
order
to
bury
it
in
the
chinese
cemetery
but
as
it
was
heavy
and
it
was
raining
that
night
the
man
could
not
finish
he
stepped
back
half
frightened
at
the
expression
on
crisostomo
face
ibarra
made
a
rush
at
him
and
grabbing
him
by
the
arm
shook
him
and
what
did
you
do
the
young
man
asked
in
an
indescribable
tone
honored
sir
do
not
get
angry
he
replied
pale
and
trembling
i
did
not
bury
the
body
among
the
chinese
in
my
opinion
a
person
might
better
be
a
suicide
than
be
buried
among
the
chinese
i
threw
the
body
into
the
lake
ibarra
laid
both
his
hands
on
the
man
shoulders
and
looked
at
him
for
a
long
time
in
a
terrifying
manner
you
are
only
an
unfortunate
fellow
he
said
at
last
and
left
the
place
on
a
run
across
bones
graves
and
crosses
like
a
madman
the
felt
of
his
arm
and
murmured
what
would
they
do
with
the
dead
the
head
priest
whips
me
with
his
cane
for
having
left
the
body
in
the
cemetery
when
i
was
sick
now
this
fellow
comes
along
and
nearly
breaks
my
arm
for
having
taken
it
up
that
is
just
like
the
spaniards
i
lose
my
place
yet
ibarra
went
on
in
great
haste
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
in
the
distance
the
old
servant
followed
him
crying
already
the
sun
was
hidden
a
large
dark
cloud
hung
over
the
western
horizon
and
a
dry
wind
bent
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
made
the
fields
of
sugar
cane
groan
with
hat
in
hand
he
went
on
not
one
tear
dropped
from
his
eye
not
one
sigh
came
from
his
breast
he
hurried
on
as
if
he
were
fleeing
from
somebody
or
something
perhaps
the
shade
of
his
father
perhaps
the
tempest
which
was
approaching
he
hurried
through
the
town
and
headed
toward
the
outlying
country
toward
that
old
house
which
he
had
not
entered
for
so
many
years
the
house
was
surrounded
by
a
wall
near
which
many
cacti
grew
and
as
he
approached
they
seemed
to
signal
to
him
the
windows
seemed
to
open
the
joyfully
waved
its
branches
and
the
doves
fluttered
about
the
little
tower
on
the
peak
of
their
garden
house
but
the
young
man
did
not
notice
these
signs
of
welcome
on
his
return
to
his
old
home
his
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
form
of
a
priest
who
was
advancing
from
the
opposite
direction
it
was
the
priest
of
san
diego
that
meditative
franciscan
the
enemy
of
the
alferez
whom
we
have
mentioned
the
wind
was
playing
with
the
wide
wings
of
his
hat
and
the
robe
of
guingon
was
flattened
out
moulded
by
the
wind
to
the
outline
of
his
form
marking
his
slender
thighs
and
in
his
right
hand
he
carried
a
cane
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
and
ibarra
had
met
as
they
approached
each
other
the
young
man
stopped
and
looked
at
him
fixedly
father
salvi
avoided
the
look
and
was
somewhat
distracted
this
vacillation
lasted
only
a
moment
ibarra
made
a
rush
toward
him
and
stopped
the
priest
from
falling
only
by
grasping
his
shoulder
then
in
a
voice
scarcely
intelligible
he
exclaimed
what
have
you
done
with
my
father
friar
salvi
pale
and
trembling
as
he
read
the
unmistakable
sentiments
which
were
depicted
on
the
young
man
face
could
not
reply
what
have
you
done
with
my
father
he
asked
again
his
voice
almost
choking
him
the
priest
shrinking
from
the
tight
grasp
of
ibarra
hand
at
last
made
a
great
effort
and
said
you
are
mistaken
i
have
done
nothing
with
your
father
what
no
continued
the
young
man
the
weight
of
his
hand
on
the
priest
shoulder
almost
making
him
kneel
no
i
assure
you
it
was
my
predecessor
it
was
father
dámaso
ah
exclaimed
the
young
man
throwing
the
priest
down
and
giving
him
a
slap
in
the
face
and
leaving
father
salvi
he
turned
quickly
and
went
toward
the
house

contemplate

the

hand
you
need
not
thank
me
replied
the
latter
i
owed
your
father
for
many
favors
he
did
me
the
only
thing
i
could
ever
do
for
him
was
to
accompany
his
body
to
the
grave
i
had
come
to
the
town
without
knowing
anybody
without
any
recommendations
without
a
reputation
without

just

i
am
now
your

me

was

used
to
come
to

distribute
pennies
among
the
poor
and
diligent
pupils
he
provided
them
with
books
and
papers
but
that
like
all
good
things
did
not
last
long
ibarra
took
off
his
hat
and
seemed
to
pray
for
a
short
time
then
he
turned
to
his
companion
and
said
did
you
tell
me
that
my
father
used
to
help
the
poor
children
how
is
it
now
oh
now
they
do
the
best
they
can
and
do
they
come
to
school
regularly
no
for
their
shirts
are
ragged
and
they
are
ashamed
ibarra
kept
silent
for
a
few
moments
how
many
pupils
have
you
now
he
asked
with
a
certain
interest
there
are
more
than
two
hundred
on
the
register
but
only
in
the
class
how
does
that
happen
the
school
teacher
sadly
smiled
it
is
a
long
and
tedious
story
said
he
do
think
that
i
am
asking
out
of
vain
curiosity
replied
ibarra
looking
seriously
at
the
distant
horizon
i
have
been
meditating
a
great
deal
on
the
matter
and
i
believe
that
it
is
far
better
to
try
to
carry
out
the
ideas
of
my
father
than
to
try
to
avenge
him
his
tomb
is
sacred
nature
and
his
enemies
were
the
people
and
the
priest
i
can
forgive
the
people
for
their
ignorance
and
as
to
the
priest
i
will
pardon
his
character
because
i
wish
to
respect
the
religion
which
he
represents
i
wish
to
be
inspired
with
the
spirit
of
the
one
who
gave
me
life
and
that
i
may
lend
my
help
i
wish
to
know
what
are
the
obstacles
here
in
the
way
of
education
the
country
will
bless
your
memory
señor
if
you
can
carry
out
the
beautiful
and
noble
ideas
of
your
dead
father
said
the
school
teacher
you
wish
to
know
what
the
obstacles
are
very
well
we
are
now
in
such
circumstances
that
unless
something
powerful
intervenes
there
will
never
be
any
education
here
first
because
there
is
no
incentive
or
stimulus
to
the
children
and
secondly
even
when
there
is
an
incentive
lack
of
means
and
many
prejudices
kill
it
they
say
that
the
son
of
a
german
peasant
studies
eight
years
in
the
town
school
who
would
want
to
spend
half
of
that
time
in
our
schools
when
the
benefits
to
be
derived
are
so
small
here
the
children
read
and
commit
to
memory
verses
and
at
times
entire
books
in
spanish
but
all
without
understanding
a
single
word
what
good
can
the
sons
of
our
farmers
get
out
of
the
school
so
long
as
this
is
the
case
and
you
see
the
evil
have
you
not
thought
out
a
remedy
ah
poor
me
replied
the
teacher
shaking
his
head
a
poor
teacher
can
not
alone
fight
against
prejudices
against
existing
influences
above
all
i
would
need
to
have
a
school
house
so
that
i
would
not
as
i
do
now
have
to
teach
from
the
priest
carriage
under
the
convent
there
when
the
children
want
to
read
aloud
they
naturally
disturb
the
father
who
at
times
comes
down
and
very
nervous
especially
when
he
has
his
attacks
finds
fault
with
the
children
and
insults
me
you
know
very
well
that
under
such
conditions
no
one
can
do
any
teaching
the
child
does
not
respect
the
teacher
from
that
moment
when
he
sees
him
mistreated
by
some
one
else
without
maintaining
his
rights
the
teacher
if
he
is
to
be
listened
to
or
if
his
authority
is
not
to
be
doubted
needs
prestige
a
good
name
moral
strength
and
a
certain
amount
of
freedom
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
give
you
an
illustration
i
wished
to
introduce
some
reforms
and
they
laughed
at
me
in
order
to
remedy
the
evil
that
i
spoke
of
a
moment
ago
i
tried
to
teach
the
children
spanish
because
not
only
does
the
government
order
it
but
because
it
will
be
a
great
advantage
for
them
to
know
the
language
i
employed
the
simplest
method
used
simple
phrases
and
nouns
without
making
use
of
hard
rules
with
the
expectation
of
teaching
them
the
grammar
as
soon
as
they
had
learned
the
language
at
the
end
of
several
weeks
almost
all
the
smarter
ones
in
the
school
understood
me
and
were
able
to
compose
phrases
in
castellano
the
teacher
stopped
and
seemed
to
be
in
doubt
then
as
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
he
began
again
i
ought
not
to
be
ashamed
of
the
history
of
my
grievances
if
any
one
had
been
in
my
place
he
would
have
had
the
same
story
to
tell
as
i
was
saying
i
began
well
several
days
later
the
priest
who
was
then
father
dámaso
sent
the
sacristan
mayor
to
tell
me
that
he
wanted
to
see
me
as
i
knew
his
character
and
was
afraid
to
make
him
wait
for
me
i
went
up
immediately
saluted
him
and
said
good
morning
to
him
in
spanish
as
was
customary
when
i
saluted
him
i
advanced
to
kiss
the
hand
which
he
held
out
but
just
at
that
moment
he
withdrew
it
and
without
replying
to
me
began
to
chuckle
scoffingly
i
was
naturally
disconcerted
and
it
was
all
done
in
the
presence
of
the
sacristan
mayor
at
the
moment
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
i
stood
and
looked
at
him
while
he
went
on
laughing
i
had
already
become
impatient
and
saw
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
committing
an
indiscretion
all
of
a
sudden
he
stopped
laughing
and
added
insult
to
injury
with
a
cunning
air
he
said
to
me
it
is
buenos
dias
eh
buenos
dias
ha
ha
how
funny
why
you
know
how
to
speak
spanish
do
you
and
then
he
continued
his
laugh
ibarra
could
not
keep
back
his
smile
you
laugh
replied
the
teacher
also
smiling
i
confess
that
i
did
not
feel
like
smiling
at
that
time
i
felt
the
blood
rush
to
my
head
and
a
thunderbolt
seemed
to
dazzle
my
brain
i
saw
the
priest
far
off
very
far
from
me
i
started
toward
him
to
reply
the
sacristan
mayor
interposed
and
said
very
seriously
in
tagalog
want
to
stop
wearing
borrowed
clothes
be
content
to
speak
in
your
own
language
and
do
not
spoil
spanish
which
is
not
meant
for
you
you
have
heard
about
ciruela
well
ciruela
was
a
teacher
who
did
not
know
how
to
read
but
he
taught
school
i
wanted
to
detain
him
for
a
moment
but
he
went
quickly
into
his
room
and
closed
the
door
violently
what
was
i
to
do
in
order
to
collect
my
salary
i
have
to
have
the
approval
of
the
priest
on
my
bill
and
have
to
make
a
journey
to
the
capital
of
the
province
what
could
i
do
to
him
the
moral
political
and
civil
authority
of
the
town
sustained
by
his
corporation
feared
by
the
government
rich
powerful
always
consulting
advising
listening
believing
and
attending
to
everything
what
could
i
do
to
him
if
he
insulted
me
i
had
to
keep
my
mouth
closed
if
i
talked
back
he
would
throw
me
out
of
work
spoiling
my
career
and
what
good
would
it
do
education
on
the
contrary
everybody
would
take
up
the
priest
side
of
the
matter
they
would
criticise
me
they
would
call
me
vain
proud
arrogant
a
poor
christian
poorly
educated
and
when
not
this
they
would
call
me
an
and
an
agitator
the
school
teacher
should
have
no
authority
he
should
only
be
lazy
humble
and
resigned
to
his
low
position
may
god
pardon
me
if
i
do
not
speak
conscientiously
and
truthfully
but
i
was
born
in
this
country
i
have
to
live
i
have
a
mother
to
support
and
i
have
to
be
resigned
to
my
lot
and
have
you
continued
to
be
discouraged
on
account
of
this
trouble
have
you
attempted
nothing
since
would
to
god
that
it
had
ended
there
he
replied
would
to
god
that
that
had
been
the
end
of
my
misfortunes
the
truth
is
that
from
that
day
i
began
to
take
a
dislike
to
my
profession
every
day
the
school
brought
to
my
mind
my
disgrace
and
made
every
hour
a
bitter
one
for
me
but
what
could
i
do
i
could
not
disappoint
my
mother
i
had
to
tell
her
that
the
three
years
of
sacrifices
which
she
had
made
for
me
in
order
that
i
might
learn
the
profession
now
made
me
happy
i
had
to
make
her
believe
that
the
profession
was
a
most
honorable
one
that
the
work
was
most
pleasant
that
the
road
was
strewn
with
flowers
and
that
the
fulfillment
of
my
duty
produced
nothing
but
friendships
if
i
had
told
her
the
contrary
i
myself
would
still
be
as
unhappy
and
would
only
make
another
unhappy
which
was
not
only
useless
but
a
sin
so
i
kept
at
my
work
and
tried
not
to
be
discouraged
i
tried
to
fight
it
down
the
school
teacher
made
a
short
pause
and
then
began
again
you
know
that
the
books
in
most
of
the
schools
are
in
spanish
excepting
the
tagalog
catechism
which
varies
according
to
the
corporation
which
appoints
the
priest
of
the
parish
the
books
generally
used
in
the
school
are
novenaries
the
and
father
astete
catechism
which
are
no
more
edifying
than
the
books
of
heretics
on
account
of
the
fact
that
it
was
impossible
to
teach
the
children
spanish
as
i
wanted
to
do
and
owing
to
the
fact
that
i
could
not
translate
so
many
books
into
the
native
language
i
decided
to
try
to
substitute
for
them
gradually
short
verses
extracts
from
the
best
tagalog
books
such
as
the
on
urbanity
by
hortensio
y
feliza
and
some
of
the
little
pamphlets
on
agriculture
sometimes
i
myself
translated
small
works
such
as
the
of
the
philippines
by
father
barranera
and
afterward
dictated
to
the
pupils
for
their
note
books
adding
at
times
some
of
my
own
observations
as
i
had
no
maps
to
teach
them
geography
i
copied
one
of
those
of
the
province
which
i
saw
in
the
capital
and
with
this
reproduction
and
by
the
aid
of
the
tiles
on
the
floor
i
was
able
to
give
them
some
ideas
about
the
country
the
new
priest
sent
for
me
although
he
did
not
reprimand
me
severely
he
told
me
however
that
my
first
duty
was
to
teach
religion
and
that
before
i
began
to
teach
any
such
things
i
must
prove
by
an
examination
that
all
the
children
knew
by
heart
the
the
and
the
of
the
christian
doctrine
so
in
the
meantime
i
am
endeavoring
to
convert
the
children
into
parrots
so
that
they
will
know
by
heart
all
of
these
things
of
which
they
do
not
understand
a
single
word
many
of
the
pupils
already
know
the
and
the
but
i
fear
that
i
am
making
father
astete
efforts
useless
inasmuch
as
my
pupils
do
not
even
distinguish
between
the
questions
and
the
answers
or
what
either
of
them
signifies
thus
we
shall
die
and
thus
shall
do
those
who
are
yet
to
be
born
yet
in
europe
they
talk
about
progress
let
us
not
be
so
pessimistic
replied
ibarra
rising
to
his
feet
the
teniente
mayor
has
invited
me
to
attend
a
town
meeting
to
be
held
in
the
tribunal
who
knows
but
that
some
plan
for
improvement
may
there
be
adopted
the
school
teacher
arose
to
go
shaking
his
head
in
token
of
doubt
chapter
x
lights
and
shadows
the
people
of
the
town
have
made
their
preparation
for
the
festival
in
honor
of
the
patron
saint
san
diego
and
are
gossiping
about
it
and
about
the
arrival
of
maria
clara
accompanied
by
her
aunt
isabel
they
rejoiced
over
it
because
they
liked
her
and
admired
her
beauty
very
much
they
also
rejoiced
in
the
change
it
had
made
in
the
priest
father
salvi
he
is
often
during
the
holy
services
they
said
he
scarcely
speaks
with
us
and
he
plainly
grows
more
thin
and
taciturn
his
cook
saw
this
constantly
and
complained
of
the
little
honor
that
he
did
his
dishes
but
what
most
excited
the
wonder
of
the
people
were
the
two
lights
which
one
could
see
shining
in
the
convent
during
the
night
while
father
salvi
was
visiting
at
the
house
of
maria
clara
the
old
dames
crossed
themselves
and
kept
on
gossiping
juan
crisostomo
ibarra
had
telegraphed
from
the
capital
of
the
province
his
compliments
to
aunt
isabel
and
her
niece
but
he
had
not
explained
his
absence
many
thought
that
he
had
been
arrested
for
assaulting
father
salvi
on
the
afternoon
of
all
saint
day
but
the
comments
increased
still
more
when
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
they
saw
ibarra
get
out
of
a
carriage
in
front
of
the
little
house
of
his
betrothed
and
courteously
salute
the
priest
who
was
also
making
his
way
thither
if
we
go
to
maria
clara
house
we
will
find
it
like
a
little
nest
among
orange
and
trees
surrounded
by
flowers
and
vines
which
creep
up
on
bamboo
sticks
and
wires
diffusing
their
delicious
perfume
the
rich
fragrance
of
the
reaches
even
to
the
window
which
looks
out
on
the
lake
here
sit
the
two
young
lovers
ibarra
was
saying
to
maria
clara
before
the
first
ray
of
morning
your
desire
shall
be
fulfilled
i
shall
arrange
all
so
that
nothing
will
be
lacking
then
i
will
write
to
my
friends
so
that
they
may
come
along
arrange
it
so
that
the
priest
can
not
come
and
why
because
he
seems
to
be
watching
me
his
deep
and
sombre
eyes
pain
me
when
he
fixes
them
upon
me
they
frighten
me
he
speaks
to
me
of
extraordinary
things
so
incomprehensible
so
strange
he
asked
me
once
if
i
had
not
dreamed
about
my
mother
letters
i
believe
he
is
half
crazy
my
friend
sinang
and
andeng
my
foster
sister
say
that
he
is
a
little
out
of
his
head
for
he
neither
eats
nor
bathes
and
he
lives
entirely
in
the
darkness
do
have
him
come
we
can
not
but
invite
him
replied
ibarra
the
customs
of
the
country
require
it
he
is
the
priest
of
your
house
and
besides
he
has
conducted
himself
nobly
toward
me
when
the
alcalde
consulted
him
on
the
business
of
which
i
have
spoken
to
you
he
had
nothing
but
praises
for
me
and
did
not
pretend
to
offer
the
slightest
obstacle
but
i
see
that
you
are
serious
i
shall
take
care
that
he
does
not
accompany
us
in
the
boat
light
steps
were
heard
they
were
those
of
the
priest
who
was
approaching
with
a
forced
smile
on
his
lips
they
began
to
talk
of
different
subjects
about
the
weather
the
town
and
the
festival
maria
clara
devised
an
excuse
and
went
out
and
while
we
are
speaking
about
festivals
said
ibarra
allow
me
to
invite
you
to
the
one
which
we
are
going
to
celebrate
it
is
going
to
be
a
country
picnic
which
we
and
our
friends
are
planning
and
where
will
it
be
held
the
girls
want
to
hold
it
near
the
brook
in
the
woods
near
the
balitî
tree
so
we
will
have
to
get
up
early
to
reach
the
place
before
the
sun
gets
hot
the
priest
reflected
and
a
moment
later
replied
the
invitation
is
very
tempting
and
i
accept
it
in
order
to
prove
that
i
hold
no
grudge
against
you
for
what
has
happened
in
the
past
but
i
will
have
to
be
a
little
late
as
i
must
fulfill
my
religious
duties
first
how
happy
to
be
like
you
entirely
free
and
independent
a
few
minutes
later
ibarra
took
his
leave
in
order
to
arrange
for
the
picnic
on
the
following
day
it
was
already
quite
dark
when
he
left
the
house
chapter
xi
the
fishing
party
the
stars
were
still
shining
in
the
sapphire
heavens
and
the
birds
were
sleeping
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
when
a
jolly
little
party
by
the
light
from
the
pitch
torches
wandered
through
the
streets
of
the
town
toward
the
lake
five
young
maidens
clinging
to
each
other
hands
or
belts
tripped
along
briskly
behind
them
came
several
elderly
women
and
a
number
of
servants
gracefully
carrying
on
their
heads
baskets
filled
with
provisions
and
various
dishes
for
the
picnic
on
seeing
their
joyful
faces
with
their
youthful
smiles
their
beautiful
black
hair
as
it
floated
in
the
breeze
and
the
wide
folds
of
their
pretty
dresses
you
would
have
taken
them
for
goddesses
of
the
night
and
would
have
thought
that
they
were
fleeing
from
day
if
perchance
you
had
not
already
known
that
it
was
maria
clara
and
her
four
friends
jolly
sinang
her
cousin
the
serious
victoria
beautiful
iday
and
the
pensive
neneng
pretty
modest
and
timid
they
were
talking
with
animation
they
laughed
pinched
each
other
whispered
in
each
other
ears
and
then
burst
out
in
shouts
of
merriment
you
girls
will
wake
up
everybody
in
town
do
you
know
that
people
are
still
asleep
said
aunt
isabel
reprimanding
them
when
we
were
young
we
did
make
such
a
noise
but
you
did
get
up
as
early
as
we
do
nor
were
the
old
men
such
great
sleepers
in
your
day
replied
little
sinang
they
were
quiet
for
a
moment
and
were
trying
to
talk
in
a
low
voice
but
they
quickly
forgot
themselves
and
were
again
filling
the
streets
with
their
youthful
laughter
and
melodious
voices
several
young
fellows
were
coming
down
the
street
lighting
their
way
with
large
bamboo
torches
they
were
marching
along
almost
noiselessly
to
the
tune
of
a
guitar
that
guitar
sounds
as
though
some
beggar
were
playing
it
said
sinang
laughing
but
when
the
young
fellows
caught
up
with
the
rest
of
the
party
the
girls
suddenly
became
as
quiet
and
as
serious
as
though
they
never
had
learned
how
to
laugh
the
young
men
however
chatted
away
saluted
the
ladies
laughed
and
smiled
and
asked
half
a
dozen
questions
without
giving
the
girls
time
to
answer
any
one
of
them
the
two
large
bancas
which
had
been
secured
to
transport
the
picnic
party
to
the
fishing
grounds
were
fastened
together
and
picturesquely
adorned
with
wreaths
and
garlands
of
flowers
and
a
large
number
of
candles
paper
lanterns
hung
from
the
improvised
covering
of
the
bancas
alternately
with
these
were
roses
pinks
and
baskets
of
fruits
such
as
pineapples
kasuys
bananas
guayabas
and
lanzones
ibarra
had
brought
his
carpets
blankets
and
rugs
and
arranged
comfortable
seats
for
the
ladies
the
poles
and
paddles
used
to
propel
the
bancas
had
also
been
ornamented
in
the
better
banca
were
a
harp
guitars
accordeons
and
a
buffalo
horn
while
in
the
other
boat
a
little
fire
had
been
lighted
in
an
improvised
stove
in
order
that
tea
coffee
and
salabat
might
be
prepared
for
the
light
breakfast
the
women
sit
here
the
men
there
said
the
mothers
on
stepping
into
the
banca
sit
still
and
do
move
or
we
will
be
capsized
cross
yourselves
before
we
start
said
aunt
isabel
as
she
traced
the
form
of
a
cross
on
her
breast
and
are
we
to
be
here
all
by
ourselves
asked
sinang
on
seeing
how
the
girls
had
been
separated
from
the
young
men
by
the
assignment
of
the
seats
then
making
a
grimace
she
asked
again
are
we
going
to
be
all
alone
aray
this
aray
was
caused
by
a
little
pinch
which
her
mother
had
given
her
on
the
arm
in
the
way
of
a
reprimand
for
her
complaint
the
bancas
were
now
putting
off
slowly
from
the
shore
the
light
from
the
torches
and
japanese
lanterns
was
reflected
in
the
water
for
the
lake
was
as
smooth
as
a
mirror
in
the
far
eastern
horizon
could
be
seen
the
first
rosy
tints
of
the
approaching
dawn
everything
was
very
quiet
the
young
women
in
consequence
of
the
separation
from
the
young
men
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
meditation
as
the
water
was
smooth
as
glass
and
the
bamboo
weirs
where
the
fish
were
to
be
found
were
not
far
off
and
it
was
still
early
it
was
decided
that
all
should
stop
paddling
and
take
breakfast
the
lights
were
put
out
for
the
day
had
dawned
and
preparations
were
made
for
desayuno
the
entire
party
became
jolly
as
they
breathed
in
the
light
breeze
that
had
come
up
even
the
women
so
full
of
presentiments
a
few
moments
ago
were
now
laughing
and
joking
among
themselves
one
young
man
alone
of
all
the
party
remained
silent
he
was
the
pilot
an
fellow
and
interesting
on
account
of
his
large
sad
eyes
and
the
severe
lines
of
his
lips
his
long
black
hair
fell
gracefully
over
his
powerful
neck
he
wore
a
shirt
of
coarse
dark
cloth
through
which
his
powerful
muscles
could
be
plainly
seen
as
he
manipulated
with
his
strong
arms
the
wide
heavy
paddle
as
if
it
were
only
a
pen
this
paddle
served
both
to
propel
and
to
steer
the
bancas
more
than
once
he
was
embarrassed
when
he
caught
maria
clara
looking
at
him
then
he
would
turn
his
eyes
quickly
to
some
other
direction
and
look
far
off
toward
the
mountain
or
the
shore
of
the
lake
the
young
maiden
pitied
him
in
his
solitude
and
offered
him
some
biscuits
the
pilot
looked
at
her
with
surprise
but
only
for
a
moment
he
took
the
biscuits
thanked
her
very
briefly
and
in
a
voice
scarcely
audible
no
one
else
took
any
notice
of
him
the
happy
laughter
and
jolly
conversation
of
the
young
men
did
not
cause
him
to
relax
a
single
muscle
of
his
face
not
even
sinang
with
all
her
jollity
had
any
effect
on
him
wait
a
minute
said
aunt
isabel
to
the
boatman
son
who
had
made
ready
his
net
and
was
just
about
to
go
up
on
the
baklad
to
take
out
the
fish
from
the
little
enclosure
at
the
end
of
the
weir
we
must
have
everything
ready
so
that
the
fish
may
pass
directly
from
the
water
to
the
pot
andeng
the
pretty
foster
sister
of
maria
clara
despite
her
clear
complexion
and
laughing
face
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
good
cook
she
prepared
the
rice
tomatoes
and
camias
while
some
of
the
young
men
tried
to
aid
or
bother
her
perhaps
in
order
to
win
her
good
will
the
other
girls
were
busy
cleaning
and
making
ready
the
lettuce
cabbage
and
peas
and
cutting
up
paayap
in
pieces
about
the
size
of
a
cigarette
finally
andeng
announced
that
the
kettle
was
ready
to
receive
its
guests
the
fish
the
fisherman
son
went
up
on
top
of
the
rack
at
the
end
of
the
weir
he
took
a
position
at
the
narrow
entrance
over
which
might
have
been
written
all
who
enter
here
leave
hope
behind
if
indeed
the
unfortunate
fish
would
know
how
to
read
and
understand
it
for
a
fish
who
enters
never
gets
out
except
to
die
the
rack
is
almost
circular
in
form
and
about
a
meter
in
diameter
and
is
so
arranged
that
a
man
can
stand
on
top
of
one
end
of
it
and
thus
take
out
the
fish
with
his
net
there
it
would
tire
me
a
bit
to
fish
that
way
said
sinang
quite
joyful
all
were
watching
attentively
already
some
of
them
in
their
vivid
imaginations
thought
they
could
see
the
fish
wiggling
their
tails
and
trying
to
get
out
of
the
little
net
their
scales
shining
in
the
bright
sun
however
the
young
man
failed
to
catch
a
single
fish
in
his
first
attempt
it
ought
to
be
full
of
fish
said
albino
in
a
low
voice
it
is
more
than
five
days
since
we
visited
the
place
last
the
fisherman
drew
out
his
net
a
second
time
but
not
a
fish
was
there
in
it
the
water
as
it
trickled
through
the
meshes
of
the
net
in
countless
drops
which
reflected
the
rays
of
the
sun
seemed
to
laugh
in
silvery
tones
an
ah
of
surprise
disgust
and
disappointment
escaped
from
the
lips
of
all
the
young
fellow
repeated
the
same
operation
but
with
a
similar
result
you
do
understand
your
business
said
albino
to
him
as
he
stepped
up
on
the
rack
and
took
the
net
from
the
hands
of
the
youngster
now
you
will
see
andeng
open
up
the
kettle
but
albino
did
not
understand
his
business
either
the
net
came
up
empty
as
before
all
began
to
laugh
do
make
any
noise
he
said
or
the
fish
will
hear
it
and
will
keep
from
being
caught
this
net
must
have
a
hole
in
it
somewhere
but
every
mesh
in
the
net
was
perfect
let
me
take
it
said
leon
iday
lover
to
albino
leon
first
made
sure
that
the
enclosure
was
in
good
condition
and
then
examined
the
net
carefully
and
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
it
he
then
asked
are
you
sure
that
no
one
has
been
out
here
for
five
days
we
are
sure
the
last
time
any
one
was
out
here
was
on
all
day
well
then
i
am
going
to
bring
out
something
this
time
unless
the
lake
is
bewitched
leon
lowered
the
net
by
its
bamboo
handle
into
the
water
but
a
look
of
surprise
was
painted
on
his
face
in
silence
he
looked
toward
the
neighboring
mountain
and
continued
moving
the
handle
of
the
net
from
one
side
to
the
other
finally
without
taking
the
net
out
of
the
water
he
murmured
in
a
low
voice
an
alligator
an
alligator
exclaimed
half
a
dozen
voices
and
the
word
was
repeated
again
while
all
stood
frightened
and
stupefied
what
did
you
say
they
asked
i
say
that
there
is
an
alligator
caught
in
the
rack
said
leon
and
sticking
the
handle
of
the
net
into
the
water
again
he
continued
do
you
hear
that
sound
that
is
not
sand
it
is
hard
skin
the
back
of
the
alligator
do
you
see
how
he
wiggles
the
bamboo
pickets
in
the
rack
he
is
struggling
hard
but
he
can
not
do
anything
wait
he
is
a
large
fellow
his
body
measures
a
palm
or
more
in
width
what
shall
be
done
was
the
question
catch
him
said
one
jesús
and
who
will
catch
him
nobody
offered
to
dive
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
rack
the
water
was
very
deep
we
ought
to
tie
him
to
our
banca
and
drag
him
along
in
triumph
said
sinang
the
idea
of
his
eating
the
fish
which
we
ought
to
have
i
have
never
seen
to
this
day
a
live
alligator
said
maria
clara
the
pilot
rose
to
his
feet
took
a
long
rope
and
went
up
cautiously
to
the
platform
on
the
top
of
the
rack
leon
gave
up
his
position
to
him
with
the
exception
of
maria
clara
none
up
till
now
had
paid
any
attention
to
him
now
every
one
was
admiring
his
fine
stature
to
the
great
surprise
of
all
and
in
spite
of
all
their
cries
the
pilot
leaped
into
the
enclosure
take
this
knife
shouted
crisostomo
drawing
out
a
toledo
knife
but
already
a
thousand
little
bubbles
were
rising
to
the
surface
of
the
water
and
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
depths
below
was
wrapped
in
mystery
jesús
maria
y
josé
exclaimed
the
women
we
are
going
to
have
a
misfortune
jesús
maria
y
josé
do
be
alarmed
señoras
said
the
old
boatman
if
there
is
any
one
in
this
province
who
can
do
it
it
is
that
fellow
who
has
just
gone
down
what
is
his
name
they
asked
we
call
him
pilot
he
is
the
best
i
have
ever
seen
only
he
does
not
like
his
profession
the
water
was
being
stirred
violently
and
it
seemed
that
a
fierce
fight
was
being
waged
in
the
depths
of
the
lake
the
sides
of
the
enclosure
swayed
to
and
fro
while
the
water
seemed
to
be
swirled
by
a
dozen
currents
all
held
their
breath
ibarra
grasped
tightly
the
handle
of
his
sharp
knife
the
fight
seemed
to
be
at
an
end
the
head
of
the
young
man
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
water
and
the
sight
was
greeted
by
joyful
shouts
from
all
the
eyes
of
the
women
were
full
of
tears
the
pilot
crawled
up
on
the
platform
carrying
in
his
hand
the
end
of
the
rope
and
as
soon
as
he
was
able
pulled
on
it
the
monster
appeared
on
top
of
the
water
he
had
the
rope
tied
twice
around
his
neck
and
once
behind
his
forelegs
he
was
a
large
fellow
as
leon
had
already
announced
he
was
beautifully
colored
and
green
moss
was
growing
on
his
back
he
bellowed
like
an
ox
struck
his
tail
against
the
sides
of
the
enclosure
snapped
at
them
and
opened
his
black
mouth
showing
his
long
teeth
the
pilot
unassisted
raised
him
up
out
of
the
water
no
one
offered
to
help
him
just
as
soon
as
the
animal
was
out
of
the
water
and
placed
on
the
platform
the
pilot
put
his
foot
on
his
back
then
closing
the
animal
massive
jaws
he
tried
to
tie
his
big
snout
tight
with
the
rope
the
reptile
made
a
last
effort
doubled
up
his
body
struck
the
floor
of
the
platform
with
his
powerful
tail
and
breaking
loose
made
a
leap
into
the
water
of
the
lake
on
the
other
side
of
the
weir
at
the
same
time
dragging
with
him
his
captor
it
seemed
that
the
pilot
would
be
a
dead
man
a
cry
of
horror
went
up
from
all
like
a
flash
of
lightning
another
body
leaped
into
the
water
so
quickly
was
it
done
that
they
had
scarcely
time
to
see
that
it
was
ibarra
maria
clara
did
not
faint
simply
because
the
filipinos
do
not
know
how
to
faint
they
all
saw
the
water
become
colored
and
tinged
with
blood
the
young
fisherman
leaped
to
the
bottom
with
his
bolo
in
his
hand
his
father
followed
him
but
scarcely
had
they
disappeared
when
they
saw
crisostomo
and
the
pilot
reappear
clinging
to
the
body
of
the
reptile
the
monster
white
belly
was
slashed
while
in
his
throat
the
knife
still
stuck
like
a
nail
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
joy
that
came
over
the
party
at
the
sight
all
arms
were
extended
to
help
them
out
of
the
water
the
old
women
were
half
crazed
with
joy
and
laughed
and
prayed
andeng
forgot
that
her
kettle
had
been
boiling
three
different
times
now
it
was
leaking
and
had
put
out
the
fire
the
only
one
who
could
not
speak
was
maria
clara
ibarra
was
unhurt
the
pilot
had
a
slight
scratch
on
his
arm
i
owe
you
my
life
said
he
to
ibarra
as
the
latter
wrapped
himself
up
in
the
shawls
and
blankets
the
voice
of
the
pilot
had
a
ring
of
sincerity
you
are
too
bold
replied
ibarra
another
time
you
must
not
tempt
god
if
you
had
never
come
back
exclaimed
maria
pale
and
trembling
if
i
had
never
come
back
and
you
had
followed
after
me
replied
the
young
man
i
would
have
been
with
all
my
family
in
the
bottom
of
the
lake
ibarra
was
thinking
that
in
those
depths
lay
the
remains
of
his
father
the
mothers
of
the
girls
did
not
want
to
go
to
the
other
baklad
or
weir
they
preferred
to
go
back
home
happy
for
the
day
had
commenced
with
a
bad
omen
and
they
feared
that
they
would
suffer
many
misfortunes
it
is
all
because
we
have
not
heard
mass
sighed
one
of
them
but
what
misfortune
have
we
had
señoras
asked
ibarra
the
alligator
was
the
unfortunate
one
that
goes
to
show
concluded
albino
that
in
all
his
fishing
life
this
reptile
has
never
heard
mass
i
never
saw
him
i
am
sure
among
the
other
reptiles
who
frequent
the
church
the
bancas
were
turned
toward
the
other
fish
rack
and
it
was
necessary
for
andeng
to
get
the
water
boiling
again
the
day
was
advancing
a
breeze
was
blowing
little
waves
were
stirred
up
on
the
water
and
rippled
around
the
alligator
the
music
began
again
iday
was
playing
the
harp
while
the
young
men
were
playing
the
accordeons
and
guitars
with
more
or
less
skill
but
the
one
who
played
best
was
albino
the
other
weir
was
visited
with
an
entire
lack
of
confidence
many
of
the
party
expected
to
find
there
the
mate
to
the
alligator
but
nature
fooled
them
and
every
time
that
the
net
was
lowered
it
was
brought
up
full
of
fish
they
then
headed
for
the
shore
of
the
lake
where
is
situated
the
forest
of
trees
centuries
old
owned
by
ibarra
there
in
the
shade
and
near
the
crystal
brook
the
party
were
to
take
their
breakfast
among
the
flowers
or
under
improvised
tents
chapter
xii
in
the
woods
very
early
that
morning
father
salví
had
said
mass
cleaning
according
to
his
custom
a
dozen
dirty
souls
in
a
few
minutes
the
reading
of
a
few
letters
which
had
arrived
well
sealed
with
wax
seemed
to
cause
the
worthy
curate
to
lose
his
appetite
for
he
allowed
his
chocolate
to
get
cold
the
father
is
ill
said
the
cook
as
he
prepared
another
cup
it
is
several
days
since
he
has
eaten
anything
of
six
dishes
which
i
put
on
the
table
for
him
he
has
not
touched
two
it
must
be
that
he
does
not
sleep
well
replied
the
servant
he
has
nightmare
since
he
changed
his
bedroom
every
day
his
eyes
are
sinking
deeper
he
grows
gradually
thinner
and
is
very
yellow
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
a
pitiful
sight
to
behold
father
salví
he
did
not
care
to
touch
his
second
cup
of
chocolate
nor
to
taste
the
cebu
cakes
he
walked
pensively
to
and
fro
in
the
spacious
sala
crumpling
between
his
bony
fingers
some
letters
which
he
would
read
from
time
to
time
finally
he
called
for
his
carriage
got
ready
and
ordered
the
coachman
to
take
him
to
the
woods
where
the
picnic
was
to
be
held
arriving
at
the
place
father
salví
dismissed
the
carriage
and
all
alone
entered
the
forest
a
shady
but
difficult
path
runs
through
the
thicket
and
leads
to
the
brook
which
is
formed
by
the
hot
springs
so
plentiful
at
the
base
of
mount
makiling
for
some
time
father
salví
was
wandering
among
the
thick
underbrush
here
trying
to
evade
the
thorns
which
entangled
his
habit
of
guingon
as
if
to
detain
him
there
trying
to
step
over
the
roots
of
the
trees
which
stuck
up
through
the
ground
and
made
the
inexperienced
traveler
stumble
again
and
again
suddenly
he
stopped
mirthful
laughter
and
the
sound
of
young
voices
reached
his
ears
the
voices
and
the
laughter
seemed
to
come
from
the
direction
of
the
brook
and
each
time
seemed
to
be
coming
nearer
i
am
going
to
see
if
i
can
find
a
heron
nest
said
a
voice
beautiful
and
sweet
and
at
once
recognized
by
the
curate
you
know
they
say
that
if
a
person
possesses
one
of
those
nests
he
can
make
himself
invisible
to
everybody
how
i
would
like
to
see
him
and
not
have
him
see
me
i
could
follow
him
everywhere
father
salví
hid
behind
the
thick
trunk
of
an
old
tree
and
listened
that
is
to
say
you
want
to
do
with
him
what
the
curate
does
with
you
watch
him
everywhere
replied
the
merry
voice
be
careful
for
jealousy
makes
one
grow
thin
and
the
eyes
sink
in
no
no
it
is
not
jealousy
it
is
pure
curiosity
replied
the
silvery
voice
while
the
other
repeated
yes
yes
jealousy
that
what
it
is
and
then
she
broke
out
in
a
merry
chuckle
if
i
were
jealous
of
him
i
would
not
use
the
heron
nest
to
make
myself
invisible
to
him
but
would
make
him
invisible
to
everybody
else
but
then
you
yourself
would
not
be
able
to
see
him
and
you
would
not
want
that
to
happen
the
best
thing
to
do
if
we
find
a
nest
is
to
give
it
to
the
priest
then
he
could
watch
us
as
much
as
he
pleased
and
we
would
not
be
troubled
with
the
sight
of
him
what
do
you
think
of
the
idea
but
i
do
believe
in
the
story
about
the
heron
nests
anyway
replied
one
but
if
i
were
really
jealous
i
would
know
how
to
keep
watch
of
a
person
and
make
myself
invisible
and
how
how
would
you
do
it
perhaps
you
would
do
as
sister
listener
does
in
the
convent
this
reference
to
days
passed
in
the
convent
provoked
a
jolly
laugh
all
around
father
salví
saw
from
his
maria
clara
victoria
and
sinang
wading
in
the
stream
all
three
were
looking
into
the
water
which
was
like
a
mirror
in
search
of
the
heron
nest
they
were
getting
wet
up
to
their
knees
the
wide
folds
of
their
bathing
skirts
allowing
one
to
guess
how
graceful
were
the
curves
of
their
limbs
they
were
wearing
their
hair
loose
and
their
arms
were
bare
striped
bodices
covered
their
breasts
the
three
lasses
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
hunting
for
that
which
did
not
exist
collected
flowers
and
plants
which
were
growing
on
the
banks
of
the
stream
the
religious
acteon
pale
and
immovable
stood
gazing
upon
maria
clara
that
chaste
diana
the
eyes
which
shone
in
those
dark
orbits
never
tired
of
admiring
those
white
and
beautiful
arms
that
pretty
round
neck
those
tiny
and
rosy
feet
as
they
played
in
the
water
as
he
contemplated
all
this
strange
feelings
were
awakened
in
his
breast
new
dreams
took
possession
of
his
burning
mind
the
three
pretty
forms
disappeared
in
a
thick
growth
of
bamboo
behind
a
bend
in
the
stream
but
their
cruel
allusions
could
still
be
heard
by
the
curate
intoxicated
with
the
strange
ideas
in
his
head
staggering
and
covered
with
perspiration
father
salví
left
his
and
looked
about
him
in
all
directions
with
staring
eyes
he
stood
immovable
in
doubt
he
took
a
few
steps
as
if
to
follow
the
young
women
but
he
turned
about
and
walked
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
in
order
to
find
the
rest
of
the
picnic
party
some
distance
ahead
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
he
could
see
a
bathing
place
well
enclosed
by
bamboo
he
could
hear
merry
laughter
and
feminine
accents
coming
from
that
direction
still
further
down
the
stream
he
could
see
a
bamboo
bridge
and
some
men
in
bathing
in
the
meantime
a
multitude
of
servants
were
bustling
about
the
improvised
fireplaces
some
engaged
in
plucking
chickens
others
in
washing
rice
and
roasting
pig
and
there
on
the
opposite
bank
in
a
clearing
which
had
been
made
were
a
number
of
men
and
women
under
a
tent
the
tent
had
been
made
by
hanging
canvas
from
the
limbs
of
some
of
the
old
trees
and
by
erecting
a
few
poles
there
in
the
group
was
the
alferez
the
teniente
mayor
the
coadjutor
the
gobernadorcillo
the
school
teacher
a
number
of
past
captains
and
lieutenants
including
even
captain
basilio
who
was
sinang
father
and
the
former
rival
of
the
deceased
don
rafael
ibarra
had
said
to
him
the
mere
fact
that
we
are
parties
to
a
does
not
mean
that
we
have
to
be
enemies
so
it
was
that
the
celebrated
orator
of
the
conservative
party
had
accepted
the
invitation
to
the
picnic
with
enthusiasm
and
had
even
brought
along
three
turkeys
and
put
his
servants
at
the
disposition
of
the
young
man
the
parish
priest
was
received
with
respect
and
deference
by
all
even
by
the
alferez
but
where
did
your
reverence
come
from
some
one
asked
on
seeing
his
face
full
of
scratches
and
his
habit
covered
with
leaves
and
pieces
of
dried
branches
has
your
reverence
fallen
down
no
i
lost
my
way
replied
father
salví
looking
down
and
examining
his
clothes
bottles
of
lemonade
were
opened
green
cocoanuts
were
cut
in
two
so
that
those
who
were
coming
out
of
the
bath
might
have
the
refreshing
milk
to
drink
and
the
delicate
meat
to
eat
the
young
women
in
addition
received
rosaries
of
sampagas
interwoven
with
roses
and
which
gave
a
beautiful
fragrance
to
their
loose
hair
some
were
sitting
or
lying
in
hammocks
which
had
been
hung
from
the
branches
of
the
trees
others
were
entertaining
themselves
in
a
game
that
was
going
on
around
a
large
flat
stone
playing
cards
checkers
dice
and
many
other
games
were
in
progress
they
showed
the
alligator
to
the
curate
but
he
seemed
absorbed
and
paid
no
attention
until
they
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
wide
wound
in
the
animal
neck
had
been
made
by
ibarra
then
too
the
pilot
the
principal
figure
in
the
incident
had
disappeared
and
could
not
be
found
anywhere
finally
maria
clara
came
out
of
the
bath
accompanied
by
her
friends
fresh
as
a
rose
when
first
it
blooms
and
when
the
dew
on
its
divine
petals
glistens
like
diamonds
her
first
smile
was
for
ibarra
and
her
first
frown
for
father
salví
the
latter
noticed
this
but
he
did
not
even
sigh
it
was
now
time
to
eat
the
curate
the
coadjutor
the
alferez
the
gobernadorcillo
and
some
of
the
captains
together
with
the
tenente
mayor
sat
down
at
the
table
over
which
ibarra
presided
the
mothers
of
the
girls
did
not
allow
any
one
to
eat
at
the
table
with
their
charges
do
you
know
anything
yet
señor
alferez
about
the
criminal
who
assaulted
father
dámaso
asked
father
salví
about
what
criminal
father
asked
the
alferez
looking
at
the
parish
priest
through
his
empty
wine
glass
about
whom
could
it
be
about
the
one
who
day
before
yesterday
struck
father
dámaso
of
course
struck
father
dámaso
asked
a
number
of
voices
the
coadjutor
was
seen
to
smile
yes
and
father
dámaso
is
now
in
bed
it
is
believed
that
the
culprit
was
that
same
elias
who
once
threw
you
into
a
señor
alferez
the
alferez
colored
up
a
little
either
from
shame
or
too
much
wine
i
thought
that
you
were
interested
in
the
affair
continued
father
salví
with
a
little
jeering
in
his
manner
the
alferez
bit
his
lips
and
mumbled
out
a
silly
excuse
the
meal
ended
and
while
tea
and
coffee
were
being
served
the
young
and
old
distributed
themselves
about
in
various
groups
some
picked
up
playing
cards
and
others
dice
but
the
young
women
anxious
to
know
the
future
preferred
to
try
their
luck
with
the
wheel
of
fortune
come
señor
ibarra
shouted
captain
basilio
who
was
a
little
bit
jolly
we
have
a
that
has
been
pending
for
fifteen
years
and
there
is
a
judge
in
the
supreme
court
in
manila
who
can
decide
it
let
us
see
if
we
can
settle
it
on
the
chess
board
what
do
you
say
the
game
of
chess
began
with
much
solemnity
if
the
game
is
a
draw
said
ibarra
it
is
understood
that
the
suit
is
off
about
the
middle
of
the
game
ibarra
received
a
telegram
which
made
his
eyes
glisten
and
his
face
grow
pale
he
put
it
in
his
not
however
without
directing
a
glance
at
the
group
of
young
women
who
continued
with
much
laughter
to
play
the
wheel
of
fortune
check
to
the
king
said
the
young
man
captain
basilio
had
no
other
resort
than
to
hide
him
behind
the
queen
check
to
the
queen
said
ibarra
threatening
it
with
his
rook
which
was
defended
by
a
pawn
not
being
able
to
cover
the
queen
nor
to
retire
it
on
account
of
the
fact
that
the
king
was
behind
it
captain
basilio
asked
permission
to
study
the
situation
a
little
certainly
with
much
pleasure
replied
ibarra
i
will
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
for
i
have
something
to
say
to
some
of
the
members
of
that
group
over
there
and
rising
to
his
feet
he
gave
his
opponent
half
an
hour
to
study
it
out
iday
held
in
her
hands
the
strip
of
cardboard
on
which
was
written
questions
while
albino
held
the
book
which
contained
the
answers
that
a
lie
it
not
so
it
lies
cried
sinang
half
in
tears
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
maria
clara
just
imagine
it
i
asked
the
question
will
i
have
some
sense
i
threw
the
dice
and
he
this
priest
albino
the
student
reads
from
the
book
the
frogs
grow
hairs
what
do
you
think
of
that
and
sinang
made
a
face
at
the
former
religious
student
who
was
still
laughing
heartily
who
told
you
to
ask
such
a
question
said
her
cousin
victoria
any
one
who
asks
such
a
question
deserves
just
such
an
answer
you
ask
a
question
said
they
all
to
ibarra
we
have
agreed
that
the
one
who
receives
the
best
answer
shall
receive
a
gift
from
the
others
we
have
all
asked
our
questions
already
and
who
has
received
the
best
answer
maria
clara
maria
clara
replied
sinang
we
made
her
ask
the
question
whether
you
loved
her
or
not
your
lover
faithful
and
constant
and
the
book
replied
but
maria
clara
colored
up
and
putting
her
hands
over
sinang
mouth
did
not
allow
her
to
finish
what
she
had
to
say
then
let
me
try
it
said
crisostomo
smiling
he
asked
the
question
will
i
succeed
in
my
present
undertaking
you
are
going
to
get
a
bad
answer
exclaimed
sinang
ibarra
threw
the
dice
and
noting
the
number
they
looked
for
the
page
in
the
little
book
with
the
corresponding
answer
dreams
are
only
dreams
read
albino
ibarra
took
out
his
and
opened
it
trembling
this
time
your
book
has
lied
he
said
full
of
joy
read
this
plan
for
school
house
approved
other
matter
decided
in
your
favor
what
does
that
mean
they
all
asked
did
you
not
tell
me
that
the
one
who
received
the
best
answer
was
to
get
a
present
the
young
man
asked
his
voice
trembling
with
emotion
while
he
carefully
divided
the
paper
into
two
parts
yes
yes
well
then
this
is
my
gift
he
said
handing
half
of
the
telegram
to
maria
clara
i
am
going
to
have
a
school
house
for
boys
and
girls
erected
in
the
town
this
school
house
will
be
my
gift
and
this
other
piece
what
does
that
mean
i
will
give
that
to
the
one
who
has
obtained
the
worst
answer
then
that
is
for
me
exclaimed
sinang
ibarra
gave
her
the
piece
of
paper
and
quickly
went
off
and
what
does
this
mean
but
the
happy
young
man
was
already
far
away
from
the
little
group
and
he
did
not
reply
he
had
gone
to
finish
the
game
of
chess
after
making
the
present
to
his
betrothed
ibarra
was
so
happy
that
he
began
to
play
without
stopping
to
think
or
even
examining
carefully
the
position
of
the
chess
as
a
result
although
captain
basilio
had
defended
himself
only
by
the
greatest
effort
the
young
man
made
so
many
mistakes
that
the
game
resulted
in
a
draw
we
end
the
suit
we
end
the
suit
said
captain
basilio
happy
over
his
success
yes
we
declare
it
off
repeated
the
young
man
whatever
decision
the
judges
may
have
been
able
to
reach
each
grasped
the
hand
of
the
other
and
shook
it
with
effusion
in
the
meantime
while
those
present
were
celebrating
the
ending
of
the
of
which
both
had
long
been
tired
four
civil
guards
and
a
sergeant
suddenly
arrived
on
the
scene
they
were
all
armed
and
had
their
bayonets
fixed
a
fact
which
naturally
disturbed
the
merriment
and
brought
fright
into
the
circle
of
women
let
everybody
be
quiet
cried
the
sergeant
whoever
moves
will
be
shot
in
spite
of
this
gruff
boast
ibarra
rose
to
his
feet
and
approached
the
sergeant
what
do
you
wish
he
asked
that
you
give
up
at
once
the
criminal
named
elias
who
acted
as
pilot
for
your
party
this
morning
he
replied
in
a
threatening
tone
a
criminal
the
pilot
you
must
be
mistaken
replied
ibarra
no
sir
that
elias
is
now
accused
of
another
crime
of
having
laid
his
hands
on
a
priest
ah
and
is
the
pilot
the
one
he
is
the
same
one
so
we
are
told
you
are
allowing
people
of
bad
reputation
to
attend
your
festivals
señor
ibarra
ibarra
looked
at
him
from
head
to
foot
and
replied
with
supreme
contempt
i
do
have
to
account
to
you
for
my
actions
at
our
festivals
everybody
is
well
received
and
you
yourself
if
you
had
come
would
have
been
given
a
seat
at
the
table
the
same
as
the
alferez
who
was
here
among
us
two
hours
ago
saying
this
ibarra
turned
his
back
to
him
the
sergeant
bit
his
mustache
and
ordered
his
men
to
search
everywhere
among
the
trees
for
the
pilot
whose
description
he
had
on
a
piece
of
paper
don
filipo
said
to
him
take
note
that
this
description
corresponds
to
that
of
of
the
natives
take
care
that
you
do
not
make
a
mistake
at
last
the
soldiers
returned
saying
that
they
had
not
been
able
to
discover
either
a
banca
or
a
man
that
aroused
their
suspicion
the
sergeant
murmured
a
few
indistinct
words
and
then
marched
off
soon
the
people
became
jolly
again
but
questions
wonder
and
comments
were
without
end
so
the
afternoon
passed
and
the
hour
for
departure
arrived
just
as
the
sun
was
dropping
below
the
horizon
they
left
the
woods
the
trees
seemed
sad
and
all
the
surroundings
seemed
to
bid
them
farewell
and
say
happy
youth
dream
of
a
day
and
a
little
later
by
the
light
of
glowing
torches
of
bamboo
and
with
the
music
of
guitars
we
leave
them
on
the
road
toward
the
town
chapter
xiii
in
the
house
of
tasio
on
the
morning
of
the
following
day
juan
crisostomo
ibarra
after
visiting
his
estates
went
to
the
house
of
tasio
the
philosopher
his
father
friend
quiet
reigned
in
the
old
man
garden
the
swallows
were
flying
about
the
gables
of
the
house
but
they
were
making
scarcely
a
sound
the
windows
were
covered
with
vines
which
clung
to
the
old
wall
and
made
the
house
appear
all
the
more
solitary
and
quiet
ibarra
tied
his
horse
to
a
post
and
walking
almost
on
crossed
the
clean
and
garden
he
went
up
the
stairs
and
as
the
door
was
open
walked
in
an
old
man
leaned
over
a
book
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
writing
on
the
walls
of
the
room
were
collections
of
insects
and
leaves
maps
and
some
shelves
of
books
and
manuscripts
tasio
was
so
absorbed
in
his
work
that
he
did
not
notice
the
arrival
of
the
youth
the
latter
not
wishing
to
disturb
the
philosopher
tried
to
retire
from
the
place
but
the
old
man
looking
up
said
what
are
you
here
and
showed
no
little
surprise
in
his
look
excuse
me
replied
ibarra
i
see
that
you
are
very
busy
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
writing
a
little
but
it
is
not
urgent
and
i
want
to
rest
myself
can
i
be
useful
to
you
in
any
way
ibarra
drew
some
papers
from
his
and
replied
my
father
was
wont
to
consult
you
in
many
things
and
i
remember
that
he
never
had
to
do
other
than
congratulate
himself
when
he
followed
your
advice
i
have
on
my
hands
a
small
undertaking
and
i
want
to
be
assured
of
success
ibarra
then
related
to
him
briefly
his
plan
for
the
erection
of
a
school
house
in
honor
of
his
betrothed
he
showed
the
stupefied
philosopher
the
plans
which
had
been
returned
from
manila
i
wish
that
you
would
advise
me
as
to
what
persons
i
ought
first
to
have
on
my
side
in
order
to
make
the
undertaking
most
successful
you
are
well
acquainted
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
i
have
just
arrived
here
and
am
almost
a
stranger
in
my
country
the
old
man
examined
the
plans
which
were
laid
out
before
him
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
that
which
you
are
going
to
carry
out
was
a
dream
of
mine
the
dream
of
a
poor
fool
he
exclaimed
greatly
moved
and
now
my
first
advice
to
you
is
that
you
never
come
to
consult
me
in
regard
to
the
matter
the
young
man
looked
at
him
in
surprise
because
sensible
people
he
continued
in
an
ironical
tone
will
take
you
for
a
fool
like
myself
people
always
consider
every
one
a
fool
who
does
not
think
just
as
they
do
and
for
this
reason
they
call
me
crazy
but
i
am
obliged
to
them
for
that
for
woe
be
to
me
when
the
time
arrives
that
they
say
i
have
sense
that
day
should
it
ever
come
would
deprive
me
of
the
little
liberty
which
i
have
purchased
by
sacrificing
my
reputation
for
being
sane
and
the
old
man
shook
his
head
as
if
to
drive
away
a
thought
and
continued
my
second
advice
to
you
is
that
you
consult
the
curate
the
gobernadorcillo
and
all
the
people
of
good
standing
they
will
all
give
you
bad
foolish
and
useless
advice
but
to
consult
does
not
mean
to
obey
try
to
appear
to
be
following
their
advice
as
far
as
possible
and
make
them
think
you
are
working
according
to
their
wishes
ibarra
sat
thinking
for
a
moment
and
then
replied
the
advice
is
good
but
difficult
to
follow
could
i
not
carry
out
my
work
without
a
shadow
reflecting
upon
it
could
i
not
carry
out
the
good
work
in
spite
of
all
does
truth
need
to
be
clothed
in
the
garments
of
falsehood
that
it
nobody
likes
the
bare
truth
i
hope
to
be
able
to
realize
all
my
hopes
without
encountering
great
resistance
said
ibarra
yes
if
the
priests
lend
you
their
hand
no
if
they
draw
it
away
all
your
efforts
will
be
battered
to
pieces
against
the
walls
of
the
curate
house
the
alcalde
will
deny
to
you
what
he
has
granted
you
not
a
mother
will
let
her
son
attend
the
school
and
then
all
your
efforts
will
have
just
an
opposite
effect
to
that
intended
you
will
discourage
all
others
who
might
wish
to
attempt
beneficent
undertakings
nevertheless
replied
ibarra
i
can
not
believe
in
this
power
of
which
you
speak
and
even
supposing
it
to
be
true
admitting
that
it
is
as
you
say
would
i
not
still
have
on
my
side
the
sensible
people
and
the
government
the
government
the
government
exclaimed
the
philosopher
raising
his
eyes
and
looking
at
the
ceiling
however
much
the
government
may
desire
to
uplift
the
country
for
its
own
benefit
and
that
of
the
mother
country
however
generous
may
be
the
catholic
kings
in
spirit
i
must
remind
you
in
confidence
that
there
is
another
power
which
does
not
allow
the
government
to
see
hear
or
judge
except
what
the
curates
or
provincial
priests
wish
the
government
is
afraid
of
the
advancement
of
the
people
and
the
people
are
afraid
of
the
forces
of
the
government
so
long
as
the
government
does
not
understand
the
people
of
the
country
the
country
will
never
get
out
from
this
guardianship
the
people
will
live
like
weak
young
children
who
tremble
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
of
their
tutor
whose
mercy
they
beg
the
government
has
no
dreams
of
a
great
future
a
healthy
development
of
the
country
the
people
do
not
complain
because
they
have
no
voice
they
do
not
move
because
they
are
too
carefully
watched
you
say
that
they
do
not
suffer
because
you
have
not
seen
what
would
make
your
heart
bleed
but
some
day
you
will
see
it
alas
some
day
you
will
hear
it
when
the
light
of
day
is
thrown
on
their
monstrous
forms
you
will
see
a
frightful
reaction
that
great
force
held
back
for
centuries
that
poison
distilled
drop
by
drop
those
sighs
so
long
repressed
all
will
come
to
light
and
will
some
day
burst
forth
who
will
then
pay
the
accounts
which
the
people
will
present
and
which
history
preserves
for
us
on
its
bloody
pages
god
the
government
and
the
church
will
never
allow
that
day
to
come
replied
crisostomo
impressed
in
spite
of
himself
the
filipinos
are
religious
and
they
love
spain
the
filipinos
will
always
know
how
much
this
nation
has
done
for
them
there
are
abuses
yes
there
are
defects
i
do
not
deny
it
but
spain
is
working
to
introduce
reforms
which
will
correct
them
she
is
devising
plans
she
is
not
selfish
can
it
be
that
my
love
for
my
native
land
is
incompatible
with
love
for
spain
is
it
necessary
to
lower
one
self
to
be
a
good
christian
to
prostitute
one
own
conscience
to
bring
about
good
i
love
my
fatherland
the
philippines
because
i
owe
to
her
my
life
and
my
happiness
because
every
man
should
love
his
native
land
i
love
spain
the
fatherland
of
my
ancestors
because
in
spite
of
all
that
may
be
said
the
philippines
owe
to
spain
and
always
will
owe
to
her
their
happiness
and
their
future
i
am
a
catholic
i
hold
dear
the
belief
of
my
fathers
and
i
do
not
see
why
i
have
to
bow
my
head
when
i
am
able
to
raise
it
nor
why
i
have
to
entrust
it
to
my
enemies
when
i
can
trample
on
them
because
the
field
in
which
you
are
sowing
your
seed
is
in
the
hands
of
your
enemies
and
you
are
weak
in
comparison
to
them
it
is
necessary
that
you
first
kiss
the
hand
but
the
young
man
did
not
allow
him
to
go
farther
and
exclaimed
violently
to
kiss
their
hands
you
forget
that
between
them
they
killed
my
father
they
threw
his
body
out
of
its
sepulchre
but
i
i
who
am
his
son
i
do
not
forget
it
and
if
i
do
not
avenge
myself
it
is
because
i
consider
the
prestige
of
the
church
the
old
philosopher
bowed
his
head
señor
ibarra
he
replied
slowly
if
you
keep
those
memories
memories
which
i
can
not
advise
you
to
forget
if
you
keep
those
memories
give
up
your
plans
and
your
undertaking
and
try
to
work
good
for
your
countrymen
in
another
way
the
undertaking
needs
another
man
than
you
for
its
execution
because
to
carry
it
out
will
not
only
require
money
and
care
but
in
our
country
tenacity
and
faith
are
also
needed
the
land
is
not
ready
for
it
it
has
been
sown
only
with
darnel
ibarra
understood
the
weight
of
these
words
but
he
was
not
going
to
be
discouraged
thoughts
of
maria
clara
filled
his
mind
he
must
fulfill
his
promise
to
her
does
not
your
experience
suggest
something
other
than
this
hard
method
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
the
old
man
took
him
by
the
arm
and
led
him
to
the
window
a
cool
breeze
was
blowing
from
the
north
before
his
eyes
lay
the
garden
stretching
out
to
the
large
forest
which
served
as
a
park
why
do
we
not
have
to
do
the
same
as
that
weak
young
bush
loaded
with
roses
and
buds
said
the
philosopher
pointing
to
a
beautiful
rose
bush
the
wind
blows
shakes
it
and
it
bends
itself
down
as
if
trying
to
hide
its
precious
load
if
the
bush
kept
itself
erect
it
would
be
broken
off
the
wind
would
scatter
its
flowers
and
the
buds
would
be
blighted
the
wind
passes
over
and
the
bush
straightens
itself
up
again
proud
of
its
treasure
thus
it
would
be
with
you
a
plant
transplanted
from
europe
to
this
stony
ground
if
you
did
not
look
about
for
some
support
and
belittle
yourself
alone
and
lofty
you
are
in
bad
condition
and
would
this
sacrifice
bring
the
fruits
that
i
hope
for
asked
ibarra
would
the
priest
have
faith
in
me
and
would
he
forget
the
offense
would
his
kind
not
be
able
to
feign
friendship
to
make
a
false
show
of
protecting
me
and
then
from
behind
in
the
darkness
fight
me
harass
me
and
wound
my
heels
thus
making
me
waver
more
quickly
than
they
could
by
attacking
me
face
to
face
given
these
premises
what
do
you
think
could
be
expected
the
old
man
remained
silent
for
some
time
not
being
able
to
reply
at
last
he
said
if
such
a
thing
took
place
if
the
undertaking
failed
i
would
console
you
with
the
thought
that
you
had
done
all
that
was
in
your
power
and
even
so
something
would
be
gained
lay
the
first
stone
sow
the
first
seed
and
after
the
tempest
has
passed
over
some
little
grain
perhaps
would
germinate
i
believe
you
exclaimed
ibarra
stretching
out
his
hand
not
in
vain
did
i
look
for
good
advice
this
very
day
i
shall
go
and
make
friends
with
the
curate
taking
leave
of
the
old
man
he
mounted
on
his
horse
and
rode
away
attention
murmured
the
pessimistic
philosopher
to
himself
as
he
followed
the
young
man
with
his
eyes
let
us
observe
carefully
how
destiny
will
unfold
the
tragedy
which
began
in
the
cemetery
but
this
time
the
philosopher
was
truly
mistaken
the
tragedy
had
begun
long
before
chapter
xiv
the
eve
of

it
is
the
tenth
of
november
the
eve
of
the
fiesta
to
be
celebrated
in
the
town
of
san
diego
departing
from
its
habitual
monotony
the
town
is
displaying
extraordinary
activity
in
the
church
houses
streets
and
the
fields
windows
are
draped
with
flags
and
decorations

and
the
sound
of
exploding
fireworks
fill
the
air
everywhere
there
is
rejoicing
in
the
streets
at
fixed
intervals
beautiful
arches
of
bamboo
are
raised
the
wood
carved
and
worked
in
a
thousand
different
ways
the
arches
are
surrounded
with
ornaments
the
very
sight
of
which
brings
joy
to
the
heart
of
the
small
boy
in
the
church
yard
a
large
and
costly
awning
has
been
erected
it
is
propped
up
by
bamboo
poles
and
so
arranged
that
the
procession
may
pass
under
it
under
its
shade
the
children

fall
and
otherwise
manage
to
tear
and
soil
their
new
shirts
which
have
been
intended
for
the
day
of
the
festival
in
the
public
square
a
platform
has
been
built
of
bamboo
nipa
and
boards
to
serve
as
the
stage
it
is
here
that
the
comedy
company
from
tondo
will
tell
wonderful
tales
and
will
compete
with

performance
of
miracles

the
filipino
loves
the
theatre
and
always
attends
dramatic
productions
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
the
gobernadorcillo
was
very
fond
of
the
theatre
and
with
the
advice
of
the
curate
he
had
selected
for
the
fiesta
the
fantastic
comedy
prince
villardo
or
the
nails
pulled
out
of
the
infamous
cave
a
play
full
of
magic
and
fireworks
from
time
to
time
the
bells
ring
out
their
merry
sounds
firecrackers
and
the
booming
of
little
cannon
rend
the
air
the
filipino
pyrotechnist
who
has
learned
his
art
without
a
teacher
of
any
renown
displays
his
skill
setting
up
pieces
representing
towers
castles
and
the
like
already
the
small
boys
are
running
at
speed
toward
the
outskirts
of
the
town
to
meet
the
bands
of
music
five
organizations
have
been
hired
besides
three
orchestras
a
band
enters
the
town
playing
lively
marches
and
is
followed
by
a
lot
of
ragged
and
half
naked
pickaninnies
this
one
perhaps
has
on
his
brother
shirt
that
one
his
father
trousers
as
soon
as
the
music
stops
these
little
tots
know
by
memory
the
piece
that
has
been
played
they
whistle
and
hum
it
with
great
delight
showing
at
this
early
age
their
musical
talent
in
the
meantime
wagons
and
carriages
arrive
bringing
relatives
friends
and
strangers
gamblers
are
also
on

murmured
a
little
chubby
man
when
he
heard
of
the
recent
arrivals
for
there
were
already
many
rumors
that
these
people
bribed
the
officer
so
that
they
might
not
be
interfered

from

country
but
the
place
where
the
greatest
animation
reigns
where
there
is
almost
a
tumult
is
over
there
on
the
level
piece
of
ground
a
short
distance
from
ibarra
house
pulleys
creak
and
the
place
resounds
with
the
sound
of
the
hammer
the
chiseling
of
stones
hewing
of
beams
and
the
shouting
of
voices
a
gang
of
workmen
is
making
an
excavation
which
will
be
wide
and
deep
others
are
busy
piling
up
quarry
stone
unloading
carts
sifting
sand

a
capstan
in
place
and
so
on

that
here
that
there
come
be
lively
about
it
shouts
a
little
old
man
with
an
animated
and
intelligent
physiognomy
as
he
goes
about
a
yard
stick
and
plumb
line
in
hand
he
is
the
director
of
the
work
ñor
juan

the
hole

large
enough
for

cylinder
said
he
to
one
of
the
stone
cutters
who
was
chiseling
off
a
large
quadrangular
stone
inside
of
this
our
names
will
be
kept
then
he
would
repeat
to
every
countryman
who
came
along
what
he
had
already
said
a
thousand
times
do
you
know
what
we
are
going
to
build
well
it
is
a
school
house
a
model
of
its
kind
something
like
those
in
germany
but
still
better
the
architect
señor
draughted
the
plans
and
i
i
am
in
charge
of
the
work
yes
sir
you
see
this
is
going
to
be
a
regular
palace
with
two
wings
one
for
the
boys
and
one
for
the
girls
here
in
the
middle
is
to
be
a
large
garden
with
three
fountains
there
on
the
sides
groves
where
the
children
can
sow
and
cultivate
plants
during
the
hours
of
recreation
thus
improving
the
time
just
see
how
deep
the
foundations
are
to
be
three
meters
and
centimeters
the
building
is
going
to
have
a
cellar
where
the
indolent
pupils
will
be
confined
this
will
be
very
close
to
the
playing
ground
and
the
gymnasium
so
that
those
who
are
punished
may
hear
the
diligent
pupils
enjoying
themselves
do
you
see
this
large
space
well
this
will
be
a
place
for
them
to
run
and
jump
the
girls
will
have
a
separate
garden
with
benches
swings
a
special
place
for
jumping
the
rope
and
rolling
hoops
fountains
and
a
this
is
going
to
be
magnificent
he
kept
going
from
one
end
to
the
other
inspecting
everything
and
passing
his
opinion
on
all
i
find
that
you
have
got
too
much
lumber
here
for
a
crane
said
he
to
a
fellow
who
was
directing
some
other
laborers
i
would
have
enough
with
three
large
beams
to
form
the
tripod
and
with
three
others
to
serve
as
supporters
o
pshaw
replied
the
other
smiling
in
a
peculiar
way
the
more
apparatus
we
give
ourselves
the
greater
effect
we
will
produce
the
massiveness
of
it
will
make
a
bigger
show
and
give
it
more
importance
they
will
say
a
lot
of
work
has
been
done
you
look
at
that
crane
that
i
am
constructing
in
a
little
while
i
am
going
to
ornament
it
with
banderolas
garlands
of
flowers
and
leaves
and
you
will
say
afterward
that
you
were
right
in
hiring
me
and
señor
ibarra
can
not
wish
for
more
than
that
the
man
laughed
ñor
juan
also
smiled
and
shook
his
head
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
plan
for
the
school
had
been
approved
by
everybody
and
all
were
talking
about
it
the
curate
had
asked
to
be
allowed
to
be
one
of
the
patrons
of
the
enterprise
and
he
himself
was
to
bless
the
laying
of
the
corner
stone
a
ceremony
which
would
take
place
on
the
last
day
of
the
san
diego
festival
as
it
was
considered
one
of
the
great
solemnities
the
dismal
presentiments
of
the
old
tasio
seemed
to
have
been
dissipated
forever
one
day
ibarra
told
the
old
man
so
but
the
old
pessimist
only
replied
things
may
go
well
at
first
but
be
on
your
guard
against
masked
enemies
chapter
xv
as
night
comes
on
great
preparations
had
also
been
made
in
the
house
of
captain
tiago
we
are
already
acquainted
with
the
man
his
love
for
pomp
and
his
pride
in
being
a
resident
of
manila
made
it
necessary
that
he
should
outdo
the
residents
of
the
province
in
the
splendor
of
his
celebration
there
was
another
thing
too
which
made
it
necessary
that
he
should
try
to
eclipse
all
others
the
fact
that
his
daughter
maria
clara
and
his
future
were
also
there
his
prospective
connection
with
ibarra
caused
the
captain
to
be
often
spoken
of
among
the
people
yes
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
of
the
most
serious
newspapers
in
manila
had
printed
an
article
on
its
first
page
headed
imitate
him
in
which
they
offered
ibarra
much
advice
and
highly
eulogized
him
the
article
spoke
of
him
as
the
illustrious
and
rich
young
capitalist
two
lines
below
he
was
termed
the
distinguished
philanthropist
and
in
the
following
paragraph
referred
to
as
the
disciple
of
minerva
who
went
to
his
mother
country
to
salute
the
real
birthplace
of
arts
and
sciences
captain
tiago
was
burning
with
generous
emulation
and
was
wondering
whether
he
ought
not
to
erect
a
convent
at
his
own
expense
days
before
the
week
of
festivities
numerous
boxes
of
provisions
and
drinks
colossal
mirrors
pictures
paintings
and
his
daughter
piano
had
arrived
at
the
house
maria
clara
and
aunt
isabel
were
already
living
there
captain
tiago
came
on
the
day
before
the
beginning
of
the
festival
as
he
kissed
his
daughter
hand
he
made
her
a
present
of
a
beautiful
religious
relic
it
was
solid
gold
and
set
with
diamonds
and
emeralds
and
contained
a
little
sliver
from
saint
peter
boat
in
which
our
saviour
sat
while
fishing
the
captain
interview
with
his
future
could
not
have
been
more
cordial
naturally
the
school
house
was
the
subject
of
conversation
captain
tiago
wanted
him
to
call
the
school
the
san
francisco
school
believe
me
he
said
san
francisco
is
a
good
patron
saint
if
you
call
it
primary
school
you
gain
nothing
who
is
primary
anyway
some
friends
of
maria
clara
arrived
and
invited
her
to
go
for
a
walk
but
return
quickly
said
the
captain
to
his
daughter
who
asked
for
his
permission
you
know
that
father
dámaso
is
going
to
dine
with
us
he
has
just
arrived
and
turning
to
ibarra
who
was
deep
in
thought
he
added
you
will
dine
with
us
too
you
will
be
all
alone
at
home
with
the
greatest
pleasure
i
assure
you
if
i
did
not
have
to
be
at
home
to
receive
visitors
replied
the
young
man
mumbling
his
words
and
evading
maria
clara
glance
bring
your
friends
along
with
you
replied
captain
tiago
cheerfully
in
my
house
there
is
always
enough
to
eat
and
besides
i
would
like
to
have
you
and
father
dámaso
understand
each
other
there
be
time
enough
for
that
replied
ibarra
putting
on
a
forced
smile
and
making
ready
to
accompany
the
young
ladies
they
went
downstairs
maria
clara
was
walking
between
victoria
and
iday
while
aunt
isabel
followed
behind
as
they
passed
down
the
street
people
stood
aside
respectfully
and
gave
them
the
inside
of
the
way
maria
clara
was
surprisingly
beautiful
now
her
paleness
had
disappeared
and
although
her
eyes
were
thoughtful
her
mouth
on
the
contrary
seemed
all
smiles
with
that
amiability
known
only
to
a
happy
maiden
she
saluted
friends
she
had
known
from
childhood
who
were
admirers
of
her
youthful
beauty
in
less
than
fifteen
days
she
had
regained
that
frank
confidence
that
childish
chatter
which
seemed
for
awhile
to
have
been
left
behind
in
the
narrow
walls
of
the
convent
it
seemed
as
though
the
butterfly
upon
leaving
its
shell
knew
all
the
flowers
at
once
it
was
enough
that
she
be
given
a
moment
of
flight
and
an
opportunity
to
warm
herself
in
the
golden
rays
of
the
sun
in
order
to
throw
off
the
rigidity
of
the
chrysalis
new
life
shone
out
in
every
part
of
her
young
being
everything
she
met
with
was
good
and
beautiful
her
love
was
manifested
with
virginal
grace
and
innocent
in
thought
she
saw
nothing
to
cause
her
to
put
on
false
blushes
however
she
was
wont
to
cover
her
face
with
her
fan
when
they
joked
with
her
but
her
eyes
would
smile
and
a
gentle
tremor
would
pass
over
her
whole
being
in
front
of
captain
basilio
house
were
some
young
men
who
saluted
our
acquaintances
and
invited
them
into
the
house
the
merry
voice
of
sinang
was
heard
as
she
descended
the
stairs
on
a
run
and
at
once
put
an
end
to
all
excuses
come
up
a
moment
so
that
i
can
go
out
with
you
said
she
it
bores
me
to
be
among
so
many
strangers
who
talk
about
nothing
but
and
playing
cards
they
went
upstairs
the
house
was
full
of
people
some
advanced
to
greet
ibarra
whose
name
was
known
to
all
they
contemplated
with
ecstacy
maria
clara
beauty
and
some
of
the
matrons
murmured
as
they
chewed
their
she
looks
like
the
virgin
after
they
had
partaken
of
chocolate
they
resumed
their
walk
in
the
corner
of
the
plaza
a
beggar
was
singing
the
romance
of
the
fishes
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
guitar
he
was
a
common
sight
a
man
miserably
dressed
and
wearing
a
hat
made
out
of
palm
leaves
his
clothing
consisted
of
a
frock
coat
covered
with
patches
and
a
pair
of
wide
trousers
such
as
the
chinese
wear
but
torn
in
many
places
from
beneath
the
brim
of
his
hat
two
fiery
orbs
flashed
out
a
ray
of
light
he
was
tall
and
from
his
manner
seemed
to
be
young
he
put
a
basket
down
on
the
ground
and
afterwards
walking
away
from
it
a
little
distance
he
uttered
strange
unintelligible
sounds
he
remained
standing
completely
isolated
as
if
he
and
the
people
in
the
street
were
trying
to
avoid
each
other
women
approached
his
basket
and
dropped
into
it
fish
fruit
and
rice
when
there
was
no
one
else
to
approach
the
basket
other
sadder
but
less
mournful
sounds
could
be
heard
perhaps
he
was
thanking
them
he
picked
up
his
basket
and
walked
away
to
do
the
same
in
another
place
maria
clara
felt
that
this
was
a
pitiful
case
full
of
interest
she
asked
about
the
strange
being
it
is
a
leper
replied
iday
he
contracted
the
disease
some
four
years
ago
some
say
by
taking
care
of
his
mother
others
by
having
been
confined
in
a
damp
prison
he
lives
there
in
the
field
near
the
chinese
cemetery
he
does
not
communicate
with
any
one
everybody
flees
from
him
on
account
of
the
fear
of
contagion
you
should
see
his
fantastic
little
house
the
wind
the
rain
and
the
sunshine
go
in
and
out
of
it
as
a
needle
goes
through
cloth
they
have
prohibited
him
from
touching
anything
belonging
to
anybody
one
day
a
little
child
fell
into
the
canal
the
canal
was
deep
but
this
man
happened
to
be
passing
near
and
helped
to
get
the
little
child
out
the
child
father
learned
of
it
made
a
complaint
to
the
gobernadorcillo
and
the
latter
ordered
that
he
be
given
six
stripes
in
the
middle
of
the
street
the
whip
to
be
afterwards
burned
that
was
atrocious
the
leper
ran
away
howling
they
pursued
him
and
the
gobernadorcillo
cried
out
him
one
might
better
be
drowned
than
have
that
disease
that
is
true
murmured
maria
clara
and
then
without
noticing
what
she
was
doing
she
went
up
to
the
basket
of
the
unfortunate
wretch
and
dropped
into
it
the
relic
which
her
father
had
just
presented
to
her
what
have
you
done
her
friends
asked
her
i
have
nothing
else
to
give
him
she
replied
concealing
the
tears
in
her
eyes
by
a
smile
and
what
is
he
going
to
do
with
the
relic
said
victoria
to
her
one
day
they
gave
him
money
but
he
pushed
it
away
from
him
with
his
cane
why
would
he
care
for
it
if
no
one
would
accept
anything
coming
from
him
if
he
could
only
eat
the
relic
maria
clara
looked
longingly
at
the
women
who
were
selling
provisions
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
the
leper
approached
the
basket
picked
up
the
piece
of
jewelry
which
shone
in
his
hands
knelt
down
kissed
it
and
after
taking
off
his
hat
buried
his
face
in
the
dust
on
which
the
young
girl
had
walked
maria
clara
hid
her
face
behind
her
fan
and
raised
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
chapter
xvi
the
hoisting
crane
while
two
of
the
actors
were
singing
the
incarnatus
est
in
the
church
at
the
celebration
of
mass
on
the
last
day
of
the
fiesta
and
all
were
kneeling
and
the
priests
were
bowing
their
heads
a
man
whispered
in
ibarra
ear
during
the
ceremony
of
the
blessing
of
the
corner
stone
do
not
go
near
the
priest
do
not
go
in
the
ditch
do
not
approach
the
corner
stone
your
life
will
depend
on
it
ibarra
looked
and
saw
that
it
was
elias
the
pilot
but
as
soon
as
he
had
spoken
he
lost
himself
in
the
crowd
the
man
kept
his
word
it
was
not
a
simple
lifting
crane
which
he
had
built
over
the
ditch
for
the
purpose
of
lowering
the
enormous
block
of
granite
it
was
not
the
mere
tripod
which
ñor
juan
had
wanted
for
holding
a
it
was
something
more
it
was
at
the
same
time
a
machine
and
an
ornament
grand
and
imposing
the
confusing
and
complicated
scaffolding
had
been
raised
to
a
height
of
more
than
eight
meters
four
heavy
timbers
buried
in
the
ground
and
supporting
each
other
with
colossal
diagonal
braces
served
as
the
base
the
braces
were
joined
to
each
other
by
immense
nails
about
half
driven
into
the
wood
perhaps
because
the
apparatus
was
only
of
a
provisional
nature
and
it
could
then
be
more
easily
taken
down
enormous
cables
were
hanging
from
all
sides
giving
the
entire
apparatus
an
aspect
of
solidity
and
grandeur
the
top
was
gay
with
flags
and
banners
of
various
colors
floating
pennants
and
massive
garlands
of
flowers
and
leaves
all
artistically
interwoven
on
high
in
the
shade
of
the
projecting
timbers
banners
and
wreaths
a
large
was
suspended
by
ropes
and
iron
hooks
over
the
shining
rims
of
these
pulleys
great
cables
passed
holding
suspended
in
the
air
a
massive
stone
the
center
of
this
stone
had
been
chiseled
out
so
that
when
lowered
upon
the
hollowed
stone
which
had
already
been
placed
in
the
ditch
a
small
enclosure
would
be
formed
between
the
two
this
space
was
to
contain
an
account
of
the
ceremonies
newspapers
manuscripts
and
coins
to
be
transmitted
perhaps
to
other
generations
in
the
far
distant
future
from
this
at
the
top
of
the
structure
the
cable
passed
down
to
another
smaller
pulley
which
was
fastened
at
the
base
of
the
apparatus
through
this
pulley
the
cable
passed
to
the
cylinder
of
a
windlass
which
was
held
to
the
ground
by
massive
beams
this
windlass
which
can
be
operated
by
only
two
hands
multiplies
man
strength
by
means
of
a
series
of
although
there
is
a
gain
in
force
there
is
of
course
a
loss
in
velocity
look
said
the
man
as
he
gave
the
crank
a
turn
look
ñor
juan
with
my
strength
alone
i
can
raise
and
lower
that
massive
block
of
stone
this
is
so
nicely
arranged
that
i
can
control
the
ascent
or
descent
of
the
stone
by
inches
thus
one
man
below
can
arrange
the
two
stones
in
place
while
i
manipulate
the
apparatus
from
here
ñor
juan
could
but
admire
the
man
as
he
smiled
in
such
a
peculiar
manner
the
curious
people
standing
about
made
comments
and
praised
the
man
for
his
work
who
taught
you
the
mechanism
asked
ñor
juan
my
father
my
father
who
is
now
dead
he
replied
with
that
same
peculiar
smile
and
who
taught
your
father
don
saturnino
the
grandfather
of
don
crisostomo
i
did
not
know
that
don
saturnino
oh
he
knew
a
good
many
things
not
only
did
he
know
how
to
whip
well
and
how
to
expose
his
workmen
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
but
he
knew
also
how
to
awaken
the
sleeping
and
how
to
make
those
awake
sleep
in
time
you
will
see
what
my
father
has
taught
me
you
will
see
and
the
yellow
fellow
smiled
in
a
strange
manner
at
two
eating
stands
there
was
now
being
prepared
a
sumptuous
and
abundant
breakfast
however
on
the
table
designated
for
the
little
ones
of
the
school
there
was
no
wine
but
instead
a
larger
amount
of
fruit
in
a
covered
passage
which
joined
the
two
stands
there
were
seats
for
the
musicians
and
a
table
covered
with
sweetmeats
candies
and
flasks
of
water
ornamented
with
leaves
and
flowers
for
the
thirsty
public
the
crowd
resplendent
in
clothes
was
already
fleeing
from
the
hot
rays
of
the
sun
and
gathering
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
or
of
the
covering
the
small
boys
climbed
the
trees
near
the
place
in
order
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
ceremony
and
looked
with
envy
upon
the
school
children
who
clean
and
well
dressed
were
occupying
a
place
designated
for
them
the
fathers
of
the
school
children
were
enthusiastic
they
poor
countrymen
that
they
were
would
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
their
children
eat
on
a
white
table
cloth
just
like
the
curate
and
the
alcalde
merely
to
think
of
it
was
enough
to
drive
away
their
hunger
soon
strains
of
music
were
heard
in
the
distance
a
promiscuous
crowd
of
persons
of
all
ages
and
dress
was
preceding
the
band
the
man
was
uneasy
and
was
examining
the
whole
apparatus
a
curious
countryman
was
also
following
his
glances
and
was
observing
every
movement
he
made
this
countryman
was
elias
who
had
also
come
to
attend
the
ceremony
his
hat
and
his
style
of
dress
almost
concealed
his
identity
he
had
secured
the
best
possible
place
for
himself
right
up
close
to
the
crane
on
the
edge
of
the
excavation
with
the
band
of
music
came
the
alcalde
the
officials
of
the
town
the
friars
with
the
exception
of
father
dámaso
and
the
spanish
employees
of
the
government
ibarra
was
conversing
with
the
alcalde
for
they
had
become
quite
friendly
from
the
time
the
young
man
paid
him
some
high
compliments
on
his
insignia
decorations
and
cordon
pride
in
belonging
to
an
aristocratic
family
was
a
weakness
of
his
excellency
captain
tiago
the
alferez
and
several
wealthy
persons
with
their
shining
silk
hats
walked
along
surrounded
by
a
group
of
youngsters
father
salví
followed
the
same
as
ever
silent
and
pensive
the
young
man
could
feel
his
heart
beat
as
they
approached
the
designated
place
instinctively
he
glanced
at
the
scaffolding
which
had
been
raised
there
he
saw
too
the
man
who
saluted
him
with
respect
and
for
a
moment
ibarra
fixed
his
eyes
on
him
to
his
surprise
ibarra
also
discovered
elias
on
the
edge
of
the
excavation
he
gave
the
young
pilot
a
significant
look
letting
him
understand
that
he
remembered
what
he
had
said
in
the
church
the
curate
put
on
his
sacerdotal
vestments
and
began
the
ceremony
the
sacristan
mayor
held
the
book
and
a
choir
boy
was
charged
with
the
and
the
vessel
of
blessed
water
the
others
who
stood
around
about
their
heads
uncovered
maintained
a
deep
silence
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
father
salví
read
in
a
low
tone
it
could
be
noticed
that
his
voice
trembled
in
the
meantime
the
articles
such
as
manuscripts
newspapers
medals
and
coins
which
were
to
be
placed
in
the
corner
stone
had
been
enclosed
in
a
little
glass
box
and
hermetically
sealed
in
a
leaden
cylinder
señor
ibarra
do
you
wish
to
put
the
box
in
its
place
the
curate
awaits
it
said
the
alcalde
to
ibarra
i
would
do
so
with
much
pleasure
replied
he
but
i
would
be
usurping
the
honorable
duty
of
the
señor
notary
the
notary
ought
to
attest
the
act
the
notary
took
it
seriously
descended
the
carpeted
stairs
to
the
bottom
of
the
excavation
and
with
fitting
solemnity
deposited
the
box
in
the
hollow
which
had
been
made
in
the
stone
the
curate
then
took
up
the
sprinkler
and
sprinkled
the
stones
with
holy
water
the
time
had
now
come
for
each
one
to
put
his
trowelful
of
mortar
on
the
surface
of
the
stone
which
lay
in
the
ditch
so
that
the
other
stone
might
fit
upon
it
and
be
made
to
adhere
to
it
ibarra
presented
the
alcalde
with
a
trowel
upon
whose
wide
silver
blade
was
engraved
the
date
but
his
excellency
first
delivered
an
address
in
spanish
citizens
of
san

said

a
solemn
tone

replied
the
others
long

the
alcalde
the
alcalde
majestically
descended
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
music
which
had
begun
to
play
he
placed
some
trowels
of
mortar
on
the
stone
and
with
equal
majesty
ascended
the
stairs
the
government
employees
applauded
ibarra
offered
another
silver
trowel
to
the
curate
who
after
fixing
his
eyes
on
him
for
a
moment
descended
slowly
to
the
bottom
of
the
excavation
when
about
half
way
down
the
stairs
he
raised
his
eyes
to
look
at
the
stone
which
hung
suspended
in
the
air
by
the
powerful
cables
but
he
only
looked
at
it
for
a
second
and
then
descended
he
did
the
same
as
the
alcalde
had
done
but
this
time
more
applause
was
heard
for
the
government
employees
were
assisted
by
the
other
friars
and
captain
tiago
father
salví
seemed
to
be
searching
for
some
one
to
whom
to
hand
the
trowel
he
looked
with
hesitation
toward
maria
clara
but
changing
his
mind
he
offered
it
to
the
notary
the
latter
for
the
sake
of
gallantry
approached
maria
clara
who
declined
it
with
a
smile
the
friars
the
government
employees
and
the
alferez
one
after
another
went
down
and
repeated
the
ceremony
captain
tiago
was
not
forgotten
ibarra
had
been
omitted
he
was
about
to
order
the
yellow
man
to
lower
the
other
stone
when
the
curate
remembered
him
in
a
pleasant
tone
and
with
an
affectation
of
familiarity
he
said
to
him
are
you
going
to
put
on
your
trowelful
señor
ibarra
i
would
be
like
the
fellow
who
made
the
stew
and
then
ate
it
replied
the
young
man
in
the
same
tone
o
go
on
said
the
alcalde
giving
him
a
gentle
push
if
you
do
i
will
order
them
not
to
lower
the
stone
and
then
we
will
have
to
wait
here
till
judgment
day
so
terrible
a
threat
forced
ibarra
to
obey
he
exchanged
the
small
silver
trowel
for
a
larger
iron
one
which
made
some
of
the
people
smile
he
advanced
quietly
and
descended
the
stairs
elias
looked
at
him
with
an
indescribable
expression
if
you
had
seen
him
you
would
have
thought
that
all
his
life
was
concentrated
in
his
eyes
the
yellow
man
looked
down
into
the
abyss
opening
at
his
feet
ibarra
after
glancing
at
the
stone
which
hung
over
his
head
and
then
at
elias
and
the
yellow
man
said
to
ñor
juan
in
a
trembling
voice
give
me
the
bucket
of
mortar
and
find
another
trowel
for
me
above
the
young
man
stood
alone
elias
was
no
longer
looking
at
him
his
eyes
instead
were
riveted
on
the
yellow
man
hand
while
the
latter
leaned
over
the
ditch
and
followed
with
anxiety
the
movements
of
ibarra
the
noise
of
the
trowel
removing
a
mass
of
sand
and
lime
was
heard
accompanied
by
the
low
murmur
of
the
employees
who
were
congratulating
the
alcalde
on
his
address
suddenly
there
was
a
frightful
creaking
the
pulley
which
was
tied
to
the
base
of
the
crane
jumped
and
then
the
windlass
struck
the
apparatus
like
a
the
timbers
swayed
ropes
flew
into
the
air
and
in
a
second
all
came
down
with
a
terrible
crash
a
cloud
of
dust
was
raised
and
a
thousand
cries
filled
the
air
nearly
all
fled
a
few
hurried
to
the
ditch
only
maria
clara
and
father
salví
remained
in
their
places
without
moving
both
pale
and
silent
when
the
cloud
of
dust
had
partially
cleared
away
ibarra
could
be
seen
standing
among
a
mass
of
beams
bamboos
and
cables
between
the
windlass
and
the
massive
stone
which
in
its
descent
had
shaken
and
crushed
everything
the
young
man
was
still
holding
the
trowel
in
his
hand
his
eyes
staring
with
fright
at
the
dead
body
of
a
man
which
was
lying
at
his
feet
half
buried
under
the
timbers
are
you
hurt
are
you
still
alive
for
god
sake
speak
said
some
of
the
employees
full
of
terror
miracle
a
miracle
cried
some
come
and
remove
the
body
of
this
unfortunate
man
said
ibarra
as
if
awakening
from
a
dream
on
hearing
his
voice
maria
clara
felt
her
strength
giving
way
and
she
fell
half
fainting
into
the
arms
of
her
friends
great
confusion
reigned
everybody
was
talking
gesticulating
and
running
from
one
side
to
the
other
up
and
down
the
stairs
all
stupefied
and
full
of
consternation
who
is
the
dead
man
is
he
still
alive
asked
the
alferez
the
body
was
identified
as
the
yellow
workman
who
had
been
standing
beside
the
windlass
let
proceedings
be
brought
against
the
superintendent
of
the
work
was
the
first
thing
that
the
alcalde
said
they
examined
the
body
felt
of
the
heart
but
it
was
no
longer
beating
the
blow
had
fallen
on
the
head
and
blood
was
oozing
from
the
nose
ears
and
mouth
some
strange
marks
were
seen
on
the
neck
there
were
four
deep
dents
on
one
side
and
a
single
but
deeper
one
on
the
other
it
looked
as
though
an
iron
hand
had
grasped
it
like
a
pair
of
pinchers
the
priests
warmly
congratulated
the
young
man
and
shook
his
hand
when
i
think
that
only
a
few
moments
ago
i
was
standing
there
said
one
of
the
employees
say
if
i
had
been
the
last
jesús
it
makes
my
hair
stand
on
end
said
another
who
was
bald
ibarra
had
departed
to
ascertain
the
condition
of
maria
clara
let
this
not
prevent
the
festival
from
continuing
said
the
alcalde
god
be
praised
the
dead
man
is
neither
a
priest
nor
a
spaniard
your
escape
must
be
celebrated
just
think
if
the
stone
had
fallen
on
you
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
presentiment
said
the
notary
i
said
so
señor
ibarra
was
reluctant
to
descend
i
saw
it
let
the
festival
go
on
give
us
some
music
weeping
will
not
bring
the
dead
man
to
life
captain
serve
warrants
right
here
let
the
clerk
of
the
tribunal
come
arrest
the
superintendent
of
the
work
put
him
in
the
stocks
put
him
in
the
stocks
eh
some
music
music
put
the
maestrillo
in
the
stocks
señor
alcalde
replied
ibarra
gravely
if
weeping
can
not
bring
the
dead
man
back
to
life
neither
can
anything
be
gained
by
putting
a
man
in
prison
when
we
do
not
know
that
he
is
culpable
i
will
give
bail
for
him
and
ask
that
he
be
given
liberty
for
some
days
at
least
well
well
but
such
a
misfortune
must
not
be
repeated
all
kinds
of
comments
were
circulating
among
the
people
the
theory
that
it
was
a
miracle
was
already
accepted
father
salví
however
seemed
to
rejoice
very
little
over
the
miracle
which
the
people
attributed
to
a
saint
of
his
order
and
of
his
parish
there
were
some
who
claimed
to
have
seen
as
the
crane
was
falling
a
figure
dressed
in
black
like
the
franciscans
go
down
in
the
ditch
it
was
without
doubt
san
diego
himself
it
was
supposed
too
that
ibarra
had
heard
mass
and
that
the
yellow
man
had
not
it
was
all
as
clear
as
the
light
of
the
sun
ibarra
went
home
to
change
his
clothes
hm
bad
beginning
said
old
tasio
as
he
left
the
place
ibarra
had
just
finished
dressing
when
a
servant
announced
that
a
countryman
was
asking
for
him
supposing
that
it
was
one
of
his
laborers
the
young
man
ordered
that
they
show
him
into
his
study
which
also
served
as
a
library
and
a
chemical
laboratory
but
to
his
great
surprise
he
met
the
muscular
figure
of
the
mysterious
elias
you
recently
saved
my
life
said
he
in
tagalog
at
once
comprehending
ibarra
movement
i
have
paid
you
only
half
of
the
debt
and
you
are
not
indebted
to
me
rather
the
contrary
i
have
come
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
speak
out
replied
the
young
man
in
the
same
language
and
somewhat
surprised
at
the
gravity
of
the
peasant
for
some
seconds
elias
looked
fixedly
into
ibarra
eyes
and
then
replied
if
human
justice
should
ever
wish
to
clear
up
this
mystery
i
beg
of
you
not
to
speak
to
any
one
about
the
warning
that
i
gave
you
in
the
church
do
be
troubled
about
that
replied
the
young
man
with
a
certain
note
of
displeasure
in
his
voice
i
know
that
they
are
hunting
you
but
i
am
no
informer
oh
it
is
not
for
my
sake
it
is
not
for
me
exclaimed
elias
not
without
some
pride
it
is
for
your
sake
i
have
nothing
to
fear
from
men
ibarra
surprise
increased
the
tone
in
which
the
countryman
was
speaking
was
new
to
him
and
did
not
seem
to
be
in
accord
either
with
his
state
or
his
fortune
what
do
you
mean
asked
ibarra
interrogating
the
mysterious
man
with
his
look
i
do
not
speak
in
enigmas
i
try
to
express
myself
clearly
for
your
greater
security
it
is
necessary
that
your
enemies
think
you
unsuspecting
and
off
your
guard
ibarra
stepped
back
my
enemies
have
i
enemies
all
of
us
have
sir
all
from
the
lowest
insect
to
man
from
the
poorest
to
the
richest
and
most
powerful
enmity
is
the
law
of
life
you
have
enemies
in
the
highest
and
in
the
lowest
ranks
you
are
planning
a
great
undertaking
you
have
a
past
your
father
your
grandfather
had
enemies
because
they
had
passion
in
life
it
is
not
criminals
who
provoke
the
most
hatred
but
rather
honorable
men
do
you
know
my
enemies
elias
did
not
reply
at
once
but
meditated
i
knew
one
the
one
who
has
died
he
replied
last
night
i
discovered
that
something
was
being
plotted
against
you
through
some
words
that
were
exchanged
between
him
and
an
unknown
man
who
lost
himself
in
the
crowd
fish
will
not
eat
this
one
as
they
did
his
father
you
will
see
said
he
these
words
attracted
my
attention
not
only
on
account
of
their
meaning
but
because
they
were
spoken
by
this
man
who
only
a
few
days
ago
had
presented
himself
to
the
superintendent
of
the
work
with
the
express
desire
that
he
be
given
charge
of
the
work
of
placing
the
corner
stone
he
did
not
ask
for
a
large
wage
but
made
a
great
show
of
his
knowledge
i
had
no
sufficient
reasons
to
attribute
evil
designs
to
him
but
something
told
me
that
my
suspicions
were
right
for
this
reason
in
order
to
warn
you
i
chose
a
moment
and
an
occasion
when
you
could
not
ask
me
any
questions
you
already
know
the
rest
elias
was
then
silent
for
some
moments
yet
ibarra
did
not
reply
nor
utter
a
word
he
was
meditating
i
am
sorry
that
the
man
is
dead
he
replied
at
last
we
might
have
been
able
to
learn
something
more
about
it
from
him
if
he
had
lived
he
would
have
escaped
from
the
trembling
hand
of
blind
human
justice
god
has
now
judged
him
god
has
killed
him
let
god
be
the
only
judge
crisostomo
looked
a
moment
at
the
man
who
was
speaking
to
him
in
this
manner
he
noticed
that
his
muscular
arms
were
covered
with
bruises
and
black
and
blue
spots
do
you
also
believe
in
the
miracle
version
of
the
affair
he
said
smiling
this
miracle
of
which
the
people
speak
if
i
believed
in
miracles
i
would
not
believe
in
god
i
would
believe
in
a
deified
man
in
fact
i
would
believe
that
man
had
created
god
after
his
image
and
likeness
he
replied
solemnly
but
i
believe
in
him
more
than
once
i
have
felt
his
hand
when
all
was
falling
headlong
threatening
destruction
for
everything
which
was
in
the
place
i
held
the
criminal
i
put
myself
by
his
side
he
was
struck
and
i
am
safe
and
sound
you
so
that
you
yes
i
held
him
when
he
wanted
to
escape
once
he
had
begun
his
fatal
work
i
saw
his
crime
i
say
god
be
the
only
judge
among
men
let
him
be
the
only
one
who
has
the
right
to
take
away
life
let
man
never
think
of
substituting
himself
for
him
and
still
you
this
time
no
interrupted
elias
foreseeing
the
objection
that
he
was
going
to
raise
it
is
not
the
same
thing
when
a
man
as
judge
condemns
another
to
death
or
destroys
his
future
forever
he
does
it
with
impunity
and
makes
use
of
the
force
of
other
men
to
carry
out
his
sentence
yet
after
all
the
sentence
may
be
wrong
and
unjust
but
i
in
exposing
the
criminal
to
the
same
danger
which
he
had
prepared
for
others
ran
the
same
risks
i
did
not
kill
him
i
allowed
the
hand
of
god
to
kill
him
do
you
not
believe
in
chance
to
believe
in
chance
is
like
believing
in
miracles
both
theories
suppose
that
god
does
not
know
the
future
what
is
a
casualty
a
happening
which
absolutely
nobody
knows
beforehand
what
is
a
miracle
a
contradiction
a
contortion
of
the
laws
of
nature
lack
of
foresight
and
contradiction
in
the
all
knowing
who
directs
the
machinery
of
the
world
are
two
great
imperfections
who
are
you
ibarra
asked
again
with
a
certain
dread
have
you
studied
i
have
had
to
believe
in
god
a
great
deal
because
i
have
lost
my
faith
in
men
replied
the
pilot
evading
the
question
ibarra
thought
that
he
understood
this
man
young
and
proscribed
he
disregarded
human
justice
denied
the
right
of
man
to
judge
his
equals
he
protested
against
power
and
superiority
of
certain
classes
of
men
over
others
but
you
must
admit
the
necessity
of
human
justice
however
imperfect
it
may
be
he
replied
god
although
he
has
ministers
on
the
earth
can
not
that
is
to
say
can
not
clearly
give
his
judgment
upon
the
millions
of
contentions
which
are
stirred
up
by
our
passions
it
is
necessary
it
is
just
that
a
man
should
sometimes
judge
his
fellows
for
good
yes
for
bad
no
to
correct
and
improve
yes
but
not
to
destroy
for
if
he
fails
in
his
judgment
there
is
no
power
that
can
remedy
the
evil
that
has
been
done
but
he
added
changing
his
tone
this
discussion
is
beyond
and
above
me
and
i
am
keeping
you
from
those
who
are
now
awaiting
you
but
do
not
forget
what
i
have
just
said
you
have
enemies
take
care
of
yourself
for
the
good
of
your
country
chapter
xvii
the
banquet
there
under
the
shade
of
the
decorated
pavilion
the
great
men
of
the
province
were
banqueting
the
alcalde
occupied
one
end
of
the
table
ibarra
the
other
on
the
young
man
right
sat
maria
clara
and
on
his
left
the
notary
captain
tiago
the
alferez
the
gobernadorcillo
the
friars
the
employees
and
the
few
señoritas
who
were
present
were
seated
not
according
to
rank
but
according
to
their
own
fancy
the
banquet
was
very
animated
but
before
it
was
half
over
a
messenger
with
a
telegram
came
in
search
of
captain
tiago
the
captain
asked
permission
to
read
the
message
and
naturally
all
begged
of
him
to
do
so
the
worthy
captain
at
first
knit
his
eyebrows
and
then
raised
them
his
face
became
pale
and
then
brightened
up
doubling
up
the
sheet
of
paper
hurriedly
he
arose
gentlemen
said
he
confused
his
excellency
the
governor
general
is
coming
this
afternoon
to
honor
my
house
and
then
he
started
on
a
run
taking
with
him
the
telegram
and
the
napkin
but
not
his
hat
all
sorts
of
questions
and
exclamations
were
shouted
after
him
the
announcement
of
the
coming
of
the
tulisanes
could
not
have
had
a
greater
effect
but
listen
when
does
he
come
tell
us
about
it
his
excellency
but
captain
tiago
was
already
far
away
his
excellency
is
coming
and
will
be
a
guest
at
captain
house
exclaimed
some
one
without
considering
that
the
daughter
and
future
were
present
the
choice
could
not
have
been
a
better
one
replied
another
the
friars
looked
at
each
other
their
expressions
seemed
to
say
the
governor
general
is
committing
another
of
his
errors
offending
us
in
this
way
he
ought
to
be
the
guest
of
the
convent
but
despite
the
fact
that
they
thought
this
they
all
kept
silent
and
no
one
of
them
expressed
his
opinion
even
yesterday
he
was
speaking
to
me
about
it
said
the
alcalde
but
at
that
time
his
excellency
was
not
decided
do
you
know
your
excellency
señor
alcalde
how
long
the
governor
general
intends
to
remain
here
asked
the
alferez
a
little
uneasy
no
not
positively
his
excellency
likes
surprises
here
come
some
other
telegrams
the
messages
were
for
the
alcalde
the
alferez
and
the
gobernadorcillo
and
announced
the
same
thing
to
each
of
them
the
friars
noticed
that
none
came
addressed
to
the
curate
his
excellency
will
arrive
at
four
this
afternoon
gentlemen
said
the
alcalde
solemnly
we
can
finish
at
our
leisure
leonidas
in
the
pass
of
thermopylæ
could
not
have
said
with
better
grace
we
will
dine
with
pluto
i
notice
the
absence
of
our
great
preacher
said
one
of
the
government
employees
timidly
the
speaker
had
an
inoffensive
look
and
before
this
had
not
opened
his
mouth
except
to
eat
during
the
entire
morning
all
who
knew
the
life
of
crisostomo
father
twitched
their
eyes
significantly
and
seemed
to
say
by
their
movements
go
on
it
a
bad
beginning
that
you
have
made
but
others
more
benevolently
disposed
replied
he
must
be
somewhat
fatigued
what
somewhat
fatigued
exclaimed
the
alferez
why
he
must
be
exhausted
what
did
you
think
of
the
sermon
this
morning
superb
gigantic
said
the
notary
to
be
able
to
speak
like
father
dámaso
a
man
needs
lungs
observed
father
manuel
martin
the
augustine
did
not
concede
more
than
lung
power
and
such
easiness
of
expression
added
father
salví
do
you
know
that
señor
ibarra
has
the
best
cook
in
the
province
remarked
the
alcalde
cutting
off
the
conversation
so
they
say
replied
one
of
the
government
employees
but
his
fair
neighbor
does
not
wish
to
do
honor
to
his
table
for
she
scarcely
takes
a
mouthful
maria
clara
blushed
i
thank
you
senor
you
occupy
yourself
too
much
about
me
but
she
said
timidly
but
your
presence
honors
him
sufficiently
concluded
the
gallant
alcalde
then
turning
to
father
salví
father
curate
i
notice
that
you
have
been
silent
and
pensive
all
day
long
it
is
my
nature
muttered
the
franciscan
i
would
rather
listen
than
talk
your
reverence
seeks
always
to
gain
and
never
to
lose
replied
the
alferez
in
a
joking
manner
but
father
salví
did
not
take
it
as
a
joke
his
eyes
flashed
a
moment
and
he
replied
you
know
very
well
señor
alferez
that
during
these
days
i
am
not
the
one
who
gains
most
the
alferez
overlooked
the
fling
with
a
false
laugh
and
pretended
not
to
hear
it
but
gentlemen
i
do
not
understand
how
you
can
be
talking
about
gains
and
losses
intervened
the
alcalde
what
will
these
amiable
and
discreet
young
women
who
honor
us
with
their
presence
think
of
us
to
my
mind
the
young
women
are
like
æolian
harps
in
the
night
it
is
only
necessary
to
lend
an
attentive
ear
to
hear
them
for
their
unspeakable
harmonies
elevate
the
soul
to
the
celestial
spheres
of
the
infinite
and
of
the
ideal
your
excellency
is
a
poet
said
the
notary
gayly
and
both
drained
their
wine
glasses
i
can
not
help
it
said
the
alcalde
wiping
his
lips
the
occasion
if
it
does
not
always
make
the
thief
makes
the
poet
in
my
youth
i
composed
verses
and
they
certainly
were
not
bad
ones
so
your
excellency
has
been
unfaithful
to
the
muses
deserting
them
for
themis
psh
what
would
you
do
it
has
always
been
my
dream
to
run
through
the
whole
social
scale
yesterday
i
was
gathering
flowers
and
singing
songs
i
hold
the
wand
of
justice
and
serve
humanity
your
excellency
will
throw
the
wand
into
the
fire
to
warm
yourself
with
it
in
the
winter
of
life
and
will
then
take
a
portfolio
in
the
ministry
added
father
sibyla
psh
yes
no
to
be
a
minister
is
not
precisely
my
ideal
the
unexpected
always
happens
though
a
little
villa
in
the
north
of
spain
to
pass
the
summer
in
a
mansion
in
madrid
and
some
possessions
in
andalusia
for
the
winter
we
will
live
remembering
our
dear
philippines
of
me
voltaire
will
not
say
jamais
été
chez
ces
peuples
que
pour
nous
y
enrichir
et
pour
les
calomnier
the
government
employees
thought
that
his
excellency
intended
a
joke
and
they
began
to
laugh
to
make
a
show
of
appreciating
it
the
friars
imitated
them
since
they
did
not
know
that
voltaire
was
the
whom
they
had
so
often
cursed
and
condemned
to
hades
father
sibyla
however
recognized
the
name
and
assumed
a
serious
air
supposing
that
the
alcalde
had
uttered
some
heresy
father
dámaso
was
waddling
down
the
road
he
was
half
smiling
but
in
such
a
malignant
manner
that
on
seeing
him
ibarra
who
was
in
the
act
of
speaking
lost
the
thread
of
his
remarks
all
were
surprised
to
see
father
dámaso
but
excepting
ibarra
they
greeted
him
with
marks
of
pleasure
they
had
already
reached
the
last
course
of
the
dinner
and
the
champagne
was
foaming
in
the
glasses
father
dámaso
showed
a
little
nervousness
in
his
smile
when
he
saw
maria
clara
seated
on
the
right
of
crisostomo
but
taking
a
chair
by
the
side
of
the
alcalde
he
asked
in
the
midst
of
a
significant
silence
were
you
not
talking
about
something
señores
continue
we
were
drinking
a
toast
replied
the
alcalde
señor
ibarra
was
mentioning
those
who
had
aided
him
in
his
philanthropic
enterprise
and
was
speaking
of
the
architect
when
your
reverence
well
i
do
understand
architecture
interrupted
father
dámaso
but
architects
and
the
dunces
who
go
to
them
make
me
laugh
you
have
an
example
right
here
i
drew
the
plan
for
a
church
and
it
has
been
constructed
perfectly
so
an
english
jeweler
who
was
one
day
a
guest
at
the
convent
told
me
to
draught
a
plan
one
need
have
but
a
small
degree
of
intelligence
however
replied
the
alcalde
seeing
that
ibarra
was
silent
when
we
are
dealing
with
certain
edifices
for
example
a
school
we
need
a
skilled
man
perito
he
who
needs
a
perito
is
a
perrito
little
dog
exclaimed
father
dámaso
with
a
scoff
one
would
have
to
be
more
of
a
brute
than
the
natives
who
erect
their
own
houses
if
he
did
not
know
how
to
build
four
walls
and
put
a
covering
over
them
that
all
that
a
school
house
is
all
looked
toward
ibarra
but
the
young
man
even
if
he
did
look
pale
kept
on
conversing
with
maria
clara
but
your
reverence
should
consider
just
look
you
continued
the
franciscan
without
allowing
the
alcalde
to
speak
see
how
one
of
our
lay
brothers
the
most
stupid
one
we
have
has
built
a
good
hospital
handsome
and
cheap
it
is
well
built
and
he
did
not
pay
more
than
eight
cuartos
a
day
to
those
whom
he
employed
even
those
who
came
from
other
towns
that
fellow
knows
how
to
treat
them
he
does
not
do
like
many
fools
and
mesticillos
who
spoil
them
by
paying
them
three
or
four
reales
does
your
reverence
say
that
he
only
paid
eight
cuartos
impossible
said
the
alcalde
trying
to
change
the
course
of
the
conversation
yes
señor
and
those
who
brag
of
being
good
spaniards
ought
to
imitate
him
you
can
see
very
well
now
since
the
suez
canal
was
opened
corruption
has
come
here
before
when
we
had
to
double
the
cape
there
were
not
so
many
worthless
people
coming
out
here
nor
did
filipinos
go
abroad
to
be
corrupted
and
spoiled
but
father
dámaso
you
know
very
well
what
the
native
is
as
quickly
as
he
learns
anything
he
goes
and
becomes
a
doctor
all
these
ignoramuses
who
go
to
europe
but
listen
your
reverence
interrupted
the
alcalde
becoming
uneasy
at
such
harsh
words
they
are
all
going
to
end
as
they
merit
he
continued
the
hand
of
god
is
upon
them
and
one
must
be
blind
not
to
see
it
even
in
this
life
the
fathers
of
such
vipers
receive
their
punishment
they
die
in
prison
eh
but
he
did
not
finish
his
remarks
ibarra
his
face
flushing
had
been
following
him
with
his
eyes
on
hearing
the
allusion
to
his
father
he
rose
and
with
a
single
bound
brought
down
his
strong
hand
on
the
head
of
the
priest
stunned
with
the
blow
the
friar
fell
on
his
back
full
of
astonishment
and
terror
no
one
dared
to
intervene
keep
back
cried
the
young
man
with
a
menacing
voice
and
brandishing
a
sharp
knife
in
his
hand
in
the
meantime
he
held
the
friar
down
with
his
foot
on
his
neck
the
latter
was
recovering
consciousness
let
no
one
approach
who
does
not
want
to
die
ibarra
was
beside
himself
his
body
trembled
and
his
threatening
eyes
almost
burst
from
their
sockets
friar
dámaso
struggled
and
raised
himself
but
the
young
man
seizing
him
by
the
collar
shook
him
till
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
collapsed
señor
ibarra
señor
ibarra
cried
some
but
nobody
not
even
the
alferez
dared
to
approach
the
glistening
blade
considering
the
strength
of
the
young
man
and
the
state
of
his
mind
all
were
paralyzed
all
of
you
people
here
have
said
nothing
now
the
matter
concerns
me
i
have
avoided
him
god
now
brings
him
to
me
let
god
judge
the
young
man
was
breathing
hard
with
iron
hand
he
held
the
franciscan
down
and
the
latter
struggled
in
vain
to
break
loose
my
heart
beats
tranquilly
my
hand
is
sure
he
looked
about
him
and
continued
is
there
among
you
any
one
who
does
not
love
his
father
any
one
who
hates
his
memory
any
one
who
was
born
in
disgrace
and
humiliation
see
do
you
observe
this
silence
priest
of
a
peaceful
god
with
your
mouth
full
of
sanctity
and
religion
and
a
miserable
heart
you
could
not
have
known
what
a
father
is
you
should
have
thought
of
your
own
do
you
see
among
this
crowd
which
you
scorn
there
is
none
such
as
you
you
are
judged
the
people
around
him
made
a
stir
believing
that
he
was
going
to
strike
back
he
again
cried
in
a
threatening
voice
what
do
you
fear
that
i
would
soil
my
hand
with
his
impure
blood
have
i
not
told
you
that
my
heart
beats
tranquilly
back
from
us
all
listen
priests
judges
you
who
think
yourselves
different
from
other
men
and
who
claim
other
rights
for
yourselves
listen
my
father
was
an
honorable
man
ask
these
people
who
venerate
his
memory
my
father
was
a
good
citizen
he
sacrificed
himself
for
me
and
for
the
good
of
his
country
his
house
was
open
his
table
was
ready
for
the
stranger
or
the
exile
who
came
to
it
in
his
misery
he
was
a
good
christian
he
always
did
what
was
right
he
never
oppressed
the
helpless
nor
brought
sorrow
to
the
miserable
and
wretched
to
this
man
he
opened
the
door
of
his
house
he
had
him
sit
at
his
table
and
he
called
him
his
friend
what
has
he
done
in
return
he
has
calumniated
him
persecuted
him
has
armed
ignorance
against
him
violating
the
sanctity
of
his
office
has
thrown
him
out
of
his
tomb
dishonored
his
memory
and
persecuted
him
even
in
death
repose
and
not
content
with
that
he
now
persecutes
his
son
i
have
fled
from
him
i
have
avoided
his
presence
you
heard
him
this
morning
profane
the
pulpit
you
saw
him
point
me
out
to
the
popular
fanaticism
i
said
nothing
now
he
comes
here
in
search
of
a
quarrel
to
your
surprise
i
suffered
in
silence
but
he
again
insults
the
sacred
memory
of
my
father
that
memory
which
every
son
holds
dear
you
who
are
here
you
priests
you
judges
have
you
seen
your
father
watching
over
you
night
and
day
and
working
for
you
have
you
seen
him
deprive
himself
of
you
for
your
good
have
you
seen
your
father
die
in
prison
heart
broken
sighing
for
some
one
to
caress
him
searching
for
some
being
to
console
him
alone
in
sickness
while
you
were
in
a
foreign
land
have
you
heard
his
name
dishonored
afterward
have
you
found
his
tomb
vacant
when
you
wished
to
pray
upon
it
no
you
are
silent
then
by
that
silence
you
condemn
him
he
raised
his
arm
but
a
young
maiden
quick
as
a
flash
put
herself
between
them
and
with
her
delicate
hands
stopped
the
arm
of
the
avenger
it
was
maria
clara
ibarra
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
that
seemed
to
reflect
madness
gradually
he
loosened
the
fingers
of
his
hand
allowed
the
body
of
the
franciscan
to
fall
and
dropped
his
knife
upon
the
ground
covering
his
face
he
fled
through
the
crowd
chapter
xviii
the
first
cloud
the
house
of
captain
tiago
was
no
less
disturbed
than
the
imagination
of
the
people
maria
clara
refusing
to
listen
to
the
consolation
of
her
aunt
and
foster
sister
did
nothing
but
weep
her
father
had
forbidden
her
to
speak
to
ibarra
until
the
priests
should
absolve
him
from
the
excommunication
which
they
had
pronounced
upon
him
captain
tiago
though
very
busy
preparing
his
house
for
the
reception
of
the
governor
general
had
been
summoned
to
the
convent
do
cry
my
girl
said
aunt
isabel
as
she
dusted
off
the
mirrors
they
will
certainly
annul
the
excommunication
they
will
write
the
pope
we
will
make
a
large
donation
father
dámaso
had
nothing
more
than
a
fainting
spell
he
is
not
dead
do
cry
said
andeng
to
her
in
a
low
voice
i
will
certainly
arrange
it
so
that
you
can
speak
to
him
what
are
the
confessionals
made
for
if
we
are
not
expected
to
sin
everything
is
pardoned
when
one
has
told
it
to
the
curate
finally
captain
tiago
arrived
they
scanned
his
face
for
an
answer
to
their
many
questions
but
his
expression
announced
too
plainly
his
dismay
the
poor
man
was
sweating
and
passing
his
hand
over
his
forehead
he
seemed
unable
to
utter
a
word
how
is
it
santiago
asked
aunt
isabel
anxiously
he
answered
her
with
a
sigh
and
dried
away
a
tear
for
god
sake
speak
what
has
happened
what
i
had
already
feared
he
broke
out
finally
half
crying
all
is
lost
father
dámaso
orders
that
the
engagement
be
broken
if
it
is
not
broken
off
i
am
condemned
in
this
life
and
in
the
next
they
all
tell
me
the
same
thing
even
father
sibyla
i
ought
to
shut
the
doors
of
my
house
and
i
owe
him
more
than
fifty
thousand
pesos
i
told
the
fathers
so
but
they
would
take
no
notice
of
it
do
you
prefer
to
lose
they
said
to
me
thousand
pesos
or
your
life
and
your
soul
alas
ay
san
antonio
if
i
had
known
it
if
i
had
known
it
maria
clara
was
sobbing
do
not
cry
my
daughter
he
added
turning
to
her
you
are
not
like
your
mother
she
never
cried
she
never
cried
except
when
she
was
whimsical
just
before
your
birth
father
dámaso
tells
me
that
a
relative
of
his
has
just
arrived
from
spain
and
that
he
wants
him
to
be
your
maria
clara
stopped
up
her
ears
but
santiago
are
you
out
of
your
head
cried
aunt
isabel
speak
to
her
now
of
another
fiancé
do
you
think
that
your
daughter
can
change
lovers
as
easily
as
she
changes
her
dress
i
was
thinking
the
same
thing
isabel
don
crisostomo
is
rich
the
spaniards
only
marry
for
love
of
money
but
what
would
you
have
me
do
they
have
threatened
me
with
excommunication
they
say
that
i
am
in
great
peril
not
only
my
soul
but
also
my
body
my
body
do
you
hear
my
body
but
you
only
give
sorrow
to
your
daughter
are
you
not
a
friend
of
the
archbishop
why
do
you
write
him
the
archbishop
is
also
a
friar
the
archbishop
does
only
what
the
friars
say
but
maria
do
not
cry
the
governor
general
will
come
he
will
want
to
see
you
and
your
eyes
are
all
inflamed
alas
i
was
thinking
what
a
happy
afternoon
i
was
going
to
pass
without
this
misfortune
i
would
be
the
happiest
of
men
and
all
would
envy
me
calm
yourself
my
girl
i
am
more
unfortunate
than
you
and
i
do
not
cry
you
can
have
another
and
better
fiancé
but
i
lose
fifty
thousand
pesos
ah
virgin
of
antipolo
if
i
could
only
have
some
luck
noises
detonations
the
rumbling
of
carriages
the
galloping
of
horses
and
a
band
playing
the
marcha
real
announced
the
arrival
of
his
excellency
the
governor
general
of
the
philippine
islands
maria
clara
ran
to
hide
in
her
bedroom
poor
girl
gross
hands
were
playing
with
her
heart
ignorant
of
the
delicacy
of
its
fibers
in
the
meantime
the
house
filled
with
people
loud
steps
commands
and
the
clanking
of
sabers
and
swords
resounded
on
all
sides
the
afflicted
maiden
was
half
kneeling
before
an
engraving
of
the
virgin
a
picture
representing
her
in
that
attitude
of
painful
solitude
known
only
to
delaroche
as
if
she
had
been
surprised
on
returning
from
the
sepulchre
of
her
son
but
maria
clara
was
not
thinking
of
the
grief
of
that
mother
she
was
thinking
of
her
own
with
her
head
resting
on
her
breast
and
her
hands
on
the
floor
she
looked
like
a
lily
bent
by
the
storm
a
future
cherished
for
years
in
her
dreams
a
future
whose
illusions
born
in
her
infancy
and
nursed
through
her
youth
gave
form
to
the
cells
of
her
being
that
future
was
now
to
be
blotted
from
the
mind
and
heart
by
a
single
word
maria
clara
was
as
good
and
as
pious
a
christian
as
her
aunt
the
thought
of
an
excommunication
terrified
her
the
threat
to
destroy
the
peace
of
her
father
demanded
that
she
sacrifice
her
love
she
felt
the
entire
strength
of
that
affection
which
until
now
she
had
not
known
it
was
like
a
river
which
glides
along
smoothly
its
banks
carpeted
with
fragrant
flowers
its
bed
formed
by
fine
sand
the
wind
scarcely
rippling
its
surface
so
quiet
and
peaceful
that
you
would
say
that
its
waters
were
dead
until
suddenly
its
channel
is
pent
up
ragged
rocks
obstruct
its
course
and
the
entangled
trunks
of
trees
form
a
dike
then
the
river
roars
it
rises
up
its
waves
boil
it
is
lashed
into
foam
beats
against
the
rocks
and
rushes
into
the
abyss
she
wanted
to
pray
but
who
can
pray
without
hope
one
prays
when
there
is
hope
when
there
is
none
we
surrender
ourselves
to
god
and
wail
my
god
cried
her
heart
why
shouldst
thou
separate
me
thus
from
him
i
love
why
deny
me
the
love
of
others
thou
dost
not
deny
me
the
sun
nor
the
air
nor
dost
thou
hide
the
heavens
from
my
sight
why
dost
thou
deny
me
love
when
it
is
possible
to
live
without
sun
without
air
and
without
the
heavens
but
without
love
never
mother
mother
she
was
moaning
aunt
isabel
came
to
take
her
from
her
grief
some
of
her
girl
friends
had
arrived
and
the
governor
general
also
desired
to
talk
with
her
aunt
tell
them
that
i
am
ill
begged
the
frightened
maiden
they
wish
to
make
me
play
the
piano
and
sing
your
father
has
promised
it
you
are
not
going
to
go
back
on
your
father
maria
clara
arose
looked
at
her
aunt
clasped
her
beautiful
arms
about
her
and
murmured
oh
if
i
had
but
without
finishing
the
sentence
she
dried
her
tears
and
began
to
make
her
toilet
chapter
xix
his
excellency
i
want
to
speak
with
that
young
man
said
his
excellency
to
an
adjutant
he
has
awakened
my
interest
they
have
already
gone
to
look
for
him
general
but
there
is
a
young
man
here
from
manila
who
insists
on
being
introduced
we
have
told
him
that
your
excellency
has
no
time
and
that
you
have
not
come
to
give
audiences
but
to
see
the
town
and
the
procession
but
he
has
replied
that
your
excellency
always
has
time
to
dispense
justice
his
excellency
turned
to
the
alcalde
as
if
in
doubt
if
i
am
not
mistaken
said
the
latter
making
a
slight
bow
it
is
a
young
man
who
this
morning
had
a
difficulty
with
father
dámaso
about
the
sermon
still
another
has
this
friar
undertaken
to
disturb
the
province
or
does
he
think
that
he
is
in
command
here
tell
the
young
man
to
come
in
his
excellency
was
walking
nervously
from
one
end
of
the
sala
to
the
other
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
in
the
were
several
spaniards
mingled
with
army
officers
and
officials
of
the
town
of
san
diego
and
some
of
the
neighboring
villages
they
were
grouped
in
little
circles
and
were
conversing
about
one
thing
and
another
all
of
the
friars
were
there
except
father
dámaso
and
they
wanted
to
go
in
and
pay
their
respects
to
his
excellency
his
excellency
the
governor
general
begs
your
reverences
to
wait
a
moment
said
the
adjutant
walk
in
young
man
the
young
man
from
manila
entered
the
sala
pale
and
trembling
everybody
was
surprised
his
excellency
must
be
irritated
to
dare
to
make
the
friars
wait
father
sibyla
said
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
i
am
losing
time
here
it
the
same
with
me
said
an
augustine
shall
we
go
would
it
not
be
better
for
us
to
find
out
what
he
thinks
asked
father
salví
we
would
avoid
a
scandal
and
we
would
be
able
to
call
to
his
mind
his
duty
to
the
church
your
reverences
can
walk
in
if
you
wish
announced
the
adjutant
as
he
escorted
out
the
young
man
whose
face
was
now
however
glowing
with
satisfaction
friar
sibyla
entered
first
behind
him
came
father
salví
father
manuel
martin
and
the
other
priests
they
all
humbly
saluted
the
governor
general
with
the
exception
of
father
sibyla
who
preserved
even
in
his
bow
an
air
of
superiority
father
salví
on
the
contrary
almost
touched
the
floor
with
his
head
which
of
your
reverences
is
father
dámaso
asked
his
excellency
unexpectedly
without
having
them
sit
down
or
even
asking
about
their
health
and
without
addressing
them
with
any
of
those
courteous
phrases
which
are
customary
with
such
high
personages
father
dámaso
is
not
among
us
señor
replied
father
sibyla
rather
dryly
your
excellency
servant
lies
ill
in
bed
added
father
salví
meekly
after
having
the
pleasure
of
saluting
you
and
of
inquiring
about
the
health
of
your
excellency
as
befits
all
the
good
servants
of
the
king
and
all
persons
of
good
education
we
also
come
in
the
name
of
the
respectful
servant
of
your
excellency
who
has
the
misfortune
oh
interrupted
the
governor
general
as
he
turned
a
chair
around
on
one
leg
and
smiled
nervously
if
all
the
servants
of
my
excellency
were
like
his
reverence
father
dámaso
i
would
prefer
to
serve
my
excellency
myself
the
reverences
did
not
know
how
to
respond
to
this
interruption
take
a
seat
your
reverences
he
added
after
a
short
pause
softening
his
tone
a
little
captain
tiago
came
in
dressed
in
a
frock
coat
and
walking
on
he
was
leading
maria
clara
by
the
hand
the
young
maiden
was
trembling
when
she
entered
but
notwithstanding
she
made
a
graceful
and
ceremonious
bow
is
this
your
daughter
asked
the
governor
general
somewhat
surprised
and
your
excellency
my
general
replied
captain
tiago
seriously
the
alcalde
and
the
adjutants
opened
wide
their
eyes
but
his
excellency
did
not
lose
his
gravity
he
extended
his
hand
to
the
young
maiden
and
said
to
her
affably
happy
are
the
fathers
who
have
daughters
like
you
señorita
they
have
spoken
to
me
about
you
with
respect
and
consideration
i
have
desired
to
see
you
and
to
thank
you
for
your
pretty
deed
of
i
am
informed
of
all
and
when
i
write
to
his
majesty
government
i
will
not
forget
your
generous
conduct
in
the
meantime
señorita
allow
me
in
the
name
of
his
majesty
the
king
whom
i
represent
here
and
who
loves
to
see
peace
and
tranquillity
among
his
subjects
and
in
my
own
name
that
of
a
father
who
also
has
daughters
of
your
age
allow
me
to
extend
to
you
most
sincere
thanks
and
propose
your
name
for
some
mark
of
recognition
señor
replied
maria
clara
trembling
his
excellency
guessed
what
she
wanted
to
say
and
replied
it
is
well
enough
señorita
that
you
are
satisfied
in
your
own
conscience
with
the
mere
esteem
of
your
own
people
the
testimony
of
one
people
is
the
highest
reward
and
we
ought
not
to
ask
more
but
however
i
will
not
let
pass
this
excellent
opportunity
to
show
you
that
if
justice
knows
how
to
punish
she
also
knows
how
to
reward
and
is
not
always
blind
señor
don
juan
crisostomo

announced
the
adjutant
in
a
loud
voice
maria
clara
trembled

the
governor
general

señorita
to
express
the
desire
to

for
a
walk
after
the
conference

will

said
father
salví
meekly
to
inform
you
that
señor
ibarra
is
excommunicated
his
excellency
interrupted
him
saying
i
am
glad
that
i
have
nothing
more
to
deplore
than
the
condition
of
father
dámaso
for
whom
i
sincerely
wish
a
complete
recovery
because
at
his
age
a
voyage
to
spain
for
his
health
would
not
be
pleasant
but
this
depends
on
him
and
in
the
meantime
may
god
preserve
the
health
of
your
reverences
they
retired
one
after
the
other
we
will
see
who
will
make
the
journey
first
said
a
franciscan
i
am
going
off
now
right
away
said
father
sibyla
with
indignation
and
we
are
going
back
to
our
provinces
too
said
the
augustins
they
could
not
endure
that
through
the
fault
of
a
franciscan
his
excellency
had
received
them
coldly
in
the
entrance
hall
they
met
ibarra
their
host
only
a
few
hours
ago
they
exchanged
no
salutations
but
their
looks
were
eloquent
the
alcalde
on
the
contrary
when
the
friars
had
disappeared
greeted
the
young
man
and
extended
his
hand
to
him
in
a
familiar
way
but
the
arrival
of
the
adjutant
who
was
looking
for
ibarra
did
not
give
them
an
opportunity
to
converse
ibarra
was
dressed
in
deep
mourning
he
presented
himself
in
a
calm
manner
and
bowed
profoundly
despite
the
fact
that
the
sight
of
the
friars
had
not
seemed
a
good
omen
for
him
the
governor
general
advanced
a
few
steps
it
gives
me
great
satisfaction
to
shake
your
hand
grant
me
your
entire
confidence
señor
such
kindness
your
surprise
offends
me
it
indicates
that
you
did
not
expect
a
good
reception
from
me
that
is
doubting
my
justice
a
friendly
reception
señor
for
an
insignificant
subject
like
myself
is
not
justice
it
is
a
favor
well
well
said
his
excellency
sitting
down
and
pointing
out
a
seat
for
ibarra
let
us
speak
frankly
i
am
very
much
pleased
with
your
action
and
i
have
already
proposed
to
his
majesty
government
that
they
grant
you
an
insignia
for
your
philanthropic
intention
of
erecting
a
school
if
you
had
asked
me
i
would
have
attended
the
ceremony
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
perhaps
the
unpleasantness
would
have
been
avoided
my
idea
of
erecting
a
school
seems
to
me
so
insignificant
replied
the
young
man
that
i
did
not
think
it
an
occasion
worthy
of
taking
the
attention
of
your
excellency
from
your
many
duties
and
cares
then
too
it
was
my
duty
to
first
address
the
highest
authority
of
the
province
his
excellency
made
a
bow
of
satisfaction
and
adopting
a
still
more
intimate
manner
continued
in
regard
to
the
unpleasantness
which
you
have
had
with
father
dámaso
have
no
fear
nor
regret
i
will
not
touch
a
hair
of
your
head
while
i
govern
these
islands
and
in
regard
to
the
excommunication
i
will
speak
to
the
archbishop
for
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
adapt
ourselves
to
circumstances
here
we
can
not
laugh
about
these
things
in
public
as
we
do
in
spain
or
in
cultured
europe
nevertheless
be
more
prudent
in
the
future
you
have
put
yourself
in
opposition
to
the
religious
corporations
which
on
account
of
your
position
and
wealth
need
to
be
respected
but
i
will
protect
you
because
i
like
good
sons
i
like
to
see
a
person
respect
the
honor
of
his
father
i
too
love
my
father
and
as
sure
as
there
is
a
god
i
know
what
i
would
have
done
had
i
been
in
your
place
and
quickly
turning
the
conversation
he
asked
you
have
told
me
that
you
come
from
europe
were
you
in
madrid
yes
señor
for
some
months
you
have
perhaps
heard
of
my
family
your
excellency
had
just
left
when
i
had
the
honor
to
be
presented
to
it
and
why
then
did
you
come
here
without
bringing
some
letter
of
introduction
señor
replied
ibarra
bowing
because
i
do
not
come
directly
from
spain
and
because
having
heard
of
your
excellency
character
i
thought
that
a
letter
of
introduction
would
not
only
be
useless
but
even
offensive
all
filipinos
are
recommended
to
you
a
smile
appeared
on
the
lips
of
the
old
officer
and
he
replied
slowly
as
if
weighing
and
measuring
his
words
it
flatters
me
to
learn
that
you
think
so
and
so
it
ought
to
be
however
young
man
you
ought
to
know
what
loads
we
bear
upon
our
shoulders
here
in
the
philippines
here
we
old
army
officers
have
to
do
and
be
everything
king
secretary
of
state
of
war
of
agriculture
of
internal
affairs
and
of
justice
the
worst
part
of
it
is
the
fact
that
in
regard
to
everything
we
have
to
consult
our
distant
mother
country
which
approves
or
rejects
our
propositions
according
to
circumstances
sometimes
blindly
and
you
know
how
we
spaniards
say
much
get
little
then
too
we
come
here
ignorant
of
the
country
and
we
leave
it
as
soon
as
we
begin
to
know
it
with
you
i
can
be
frank
for
it
would
be
useless
to
appear
otherwise
in
spain
where
each
branch
of
the
government
has
its
own
minister
born
and
brought
up
in
the
country
where
they
have
the
press
and
public
opinion
the
opposition
is
open
and
before
the
eyes
of
the
government
and
shows
up
its
faults
yet
even
there
all
is
imperfect
and
defective
and
when
you
consider
the
conditions
here
it
is
a
wonder
that
all
is
not
upset
with
all
those
advantages
lacking
and
with
the
opposition
working
in
the
dark
good
intentions
and
wishes
are
not
wanting
in
us
governing
officials
but
we
find
ourselves
obliged
to
make
use
of
eyes
and
arms
which
frequently
we
do
not
know
and
which
perhaps
instead
of
serving
the
country
serve
only
their
own
interests
that
is
not
our
fault
it
is
the
fault
of
circumstances
you
arouse
my
interest
and
i
do
not
want
our
present
system
of
government
to
prejudice
you
in
any
way
i
can
not
watch
everything
nor
can
i
attend
to
all
can
i
be
useful
to
you
in
any
way
have
you
anything
to
request
ibarra
meditated
señor
he
replied
my
greatest
desire
is
the
happiness
of
my
country
a
happiness
due
to
the
efforts
of
our
mother
country
and
to
the
efforts
of
my
fellow
countrymen
united
with
the
eternal
bonds
of
a
common
interest
and
common
object
what
i
ask
the
government
can
only
give
after
many
years
of
continuous
work
and
proper
reforms
his
excellency
looked
at
him
for
several
seconds
with
a
look
which
ibarra
met
naturally
without
timidity
and
without
boldness
you
are
the
first
man
with
whom
i
have
spoken
in
this
country
he
exclaimed
grasping
his
hand
your
excellency
has
only
seen
those
who
lead
a
grovelling
existence
in
the
city
you
have
not
seen
the
calumniated
hovels
of
our
towns
if
you
had
you
would
have
seen
true
men
if
generous
hearts
and
simple
manners
make
true
men
the
governor
general
arose
and
paced
the
sala
from
one
side
to
the
other
señor
ibarra
he
exclaimed
stopping
a
moment
the
young
man
arose
i
will
probably
leave
here
within
a
month
your
education
and
your
mode
of
thinking
are
not
for
this
country
sell
what
you
possess
get
your
trunk
ready
and
come
with
me
to
europe
that
climate
will
be
better
for
you
i
shall
cherish
all
my
life
the
memory
of
your
excellency
kindness
replied
ibarra
moved
by
what
the
governor
general
had
said
but
i
ought
to
live
in
the
country
where
my
fathers
have
lived
where
they
have
died
you
should
say
to
speak
more
exactly
believe
me
i
possibly
know
your
country
better
than
you
do
yourself
ah
now
i
remember
he
exclaimed
changing
the
tone
of
his
voice
you
are
going
to
marry
a
lovely
girl
and
i
am
keeping
you
here
go
go
to
her
side
and
that
you
may
have
greater
liberty
send
her
father
to
me
he
added
smiling
do
not
forget
however
that
i
want
you
to
accompany
me
for
a
walk
ibarra
bowed
and
departed
his
excellency
called
his
adjutant
i
am
happy
said
he
giving
him
a
light
slap
on
the
shoulder
i
have
seen
for
the
first
time
how
one
can
be
a
good
spaniard
without
ceasing
to
be
a
good
filipino
and
to
love
his
country
at
last
i
have
shown
the
reverences
that
we
are
not
all
their
playthings
this
young
man
has
afforded
me
the
opportunity
and
in
a
short
time
i
will
have
settled
all
of
my
accounts
with
the
friar
it
a
pity
that
this
young
man
some
day
or
other
but
call
the
alcalde
to
me
the
latter
presented
himself
at
once
señor
alcalde
he
said
to
him
as
he
entered
the
room
in
order
to
avoid
a
repetition
of
scenes
such
as
your
honor
witnessed
this
afternoon
scenes
which
i
deplore
because
they
take
away
the
prestige
of
the
government
and
all
spaniards
i
want
to
commend
to
you
warmly
señor
ibarra
that
you
may
not
only
aid
him
in
carrying
out
his
patriotic
ends
but
also
prevent
in
the
future
any
person
of
whatever
class
or
under
whatever
pretext
from
molesting
him
the
alcalde
understood
the
reprimand
and
bowed
to
conceal
his
confusion
have
the
alferez
who
is
in
command
here
informed
to
the
same
effect
and
you
will
find
out
if
it
is
true
that
this
officer
has
methods
of
procedure
that
are
not
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
i
have
heard
more
than
one
complaint
on
this
score
captain
tiago
all
starched
and
ironed
presented
himself
don
santiago
said
his
excellency
in
a
cordial
tone
of
voice
a
little
while
ago
i
was
congratulating
you
on
having
a
daughter
like
the
señorita
de
los
santos
now
i
want
to
congratulate
you
on
your
future
the
most
virtuous
of
daughters
is
certainly
worthy
of
the
best
citizen
of
the
philippines
is
the
date
of
the
wedding
known
señor
stammered
the
captain
wiping
away
the
perspiration
which
was
running
down
his
face
o
come
i
see
that
there
is
nothing
definite
if
you
need
godfathers
i
will
be
one
of
them
with
the
greatest
pleasure
i
would
do
it
to
take
away
the
bad
taste
which
so
many
of
the
weddings
which
i
have
attended
here
have
left
in
my
mouth
he
added
turning
to
the
alcalde
yes
señor
replied
captain
tiago
with
a
smile
which
inspired
compassion
ibarra
had
gone
in
search
of
maria
clara
almost
on
a
run
he
had
so
many
things
to
tell
her
he
heard
some
gentle
voices
in
one
of
the
rooms
and
knocked
at
the
door
who
knocks
asked
maria
clara
the
voices
were
silenced
and
the
door
was
not
opened
it
is
i
may
i
come
in
asked
the
young
man
his
heart
beating
violently
the
silence
was
not
broken
a
few
seconds
afterward
gentle
steps
approached
the
door
and
sinang
cheerful
voice
murmured
through
the
crisostomo
we
are
going
to
the
theatre
write
what
you
have
to
say
to
maria
clara
then
the
footsteps
were
heard
retreating
as
quickly
as
they
had
come
what
does
that
mean
murmured
ibarra
to
himself
as
he
went
slowly
away
from
the
door
chapter
xx
the
procession
in
the
evening
by
the
light
of
lanterns
hung
from
windows
to
the
ringing
of
bells
and
bursting
of
bombs
the
procession
started
for
the
fourth
time
the
governor
general
left
the
house
on
foot
in
company
with
his
two
adjutants
captain
tiago
the
alcalde
the
alferez
and
ibarra
the
civil
guards
and
the
officials
of
the
town
preceded
them
and
cleared
the
way
his
excellency
had
been
invited
to
witness
the
procession
from
the
house
of
the
gobernadorcillo
in
front
of
which
a
platform
had
been
erected
for
the
recitation
of
a
loa
or
religious
poem
in
honor
of
the
patron
saint
ibarra
had
previously
declined
with
pleasure
an
invitation
to
hear
this
poetical
composition
as
he
had
preferred
to
witness
the
procession
from
the
house
of
captain
tiago
with
maria
clara
and
her
friends
but
as
his
excellency
wished
to
hear
the
loa
there
was
no
other
remedy
for
ibarra
but
to
console
himself
with
the
hope
of
seeing
her
at
the
theatre
the
procession
was
headed
by
three
sacristans
carrying
silver
candlesticks
the
children
of
the
school
accompanied
by
their
teacher
followed
then
came
the
small
boys
with
colored
paper
lanterns
fastened
to
the
ends
of
pieces
of
bamboo
each
more
or
less
adorned
according
to
the
caprices
of
the
boy
for
this
part
of
the
illumination
was
paid
for
entirely
by
themselves
however
they
fulfilled
this
duty
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
in
the
midst
of
it
all
men
serving
as
police
passed
to
and
fro
to
see
that
the
files
of
the
procession
were
not
broken
or
the
people
jammed
together
in
a
crowd
for
this
purpose
they
used
their
wands
and
inflicted
some
hard
blows
thus
managing
to
add
to
the
brilliancy
of
the
procession
to
the
edification
of
souls
and
to
the
glory
of
religious
pomp
at
the
same
time
that
the
officers
inflicted
these
sanctified
floggings
with
their
wands
free
of
charge
others
to
console
those
who
had
been
punished
distributed
wax
and
tallow
candles
also
free
of
charge
señor
alcalde
said
ibarra
in
a
low
voice
do
they
inflict
those
blows
to
punish
the
sinners
or
merely
for
pleasure
you
are
right
señor
ibarra
replied
the
governor
general
who
had
overheard
his
question
this
spectacle
barbarous
astonishing
to
those
who
come
from
other
countries
ought
to
be
prohibited
although
it
can
not
be
explained
the
first
saint
who
appeared
was
san
juan
el
baptisto
on
seeing
him
you
would
say
that
the
cousin
of
our
saviour
did
not
enjoy
any
great
renown
among
these
people
he
had
slender
feet
and
legs
and
the
face
of
a
hermit
and
was
carried
along
on
an
old
wooden
litter
in
marked
contrast
to
the
representation
of
san
juan
was
that
of
san
francisco
the
founder
of
the
great
order
the
latter
was
drawn
in
a
car
and
as
tasio
said
what
a
car
how
many
lights
and
glass
lanterns
why
i
have
never
seen
you
surrounded
by
so
many
illuminations
giovanni
bernardone
and
what
music
behind
the
music
came
a
standard
representing
the
same
saint
but
with
seven
wings
it
was
carried
by
the
brothers
of
the
third
order
dressed
in
guingon
and
praying
in
a
loud
and
mournful
voice
the
next
in
the
procession
was
santa
maria
magdalena
a
most
beautiful
image
with
an
abundant
growth
of
hair
a
handkerchief
of
embroidered
piña
cloth
between
her
fingers
and
wearing
a
dress
of
silk
adorned
with
lights
and
incense
surrounded
her
the
glass
tears
from
her
eyes
reflected
the
colors
of
the
colored
fire
which
was
burned
here
and
there
giving
a
fantastic
aspect
to
the
procession
consequently
the
sinful
saint
appeared
to
be
weeping
now
green
now
red
and
now
blue
tears
the
people
did
not
begin
to
burn
these
colored
lights
till
san
francisco
was
passing
san
juan
el
baptisto
did
not
enjoy
this
honor
passing
by
quickly
ashamed
perhaps
to
go
dressed
in
skins
among
so
many
saints
covered
with
gold
and
precious
jewels
there
goes
our
saint
cried
the
daughter
of
the
gobernadorcillo
to
her
visitors
i
loaned
her
my
rings
but
i
did
it
to
get
to
heaven
those
carrying
the
illuminations
stopped
near
the
platform
to
hear
the
loa
the
saints
did
the
same
they
and
their
carriers
wanted
to
hear
the
verses
those
who
carried
san
juan
tired
of
waiting
squatted
down
in
the
characteristic
filipino
manner
and
found
it
convenient
to
leave
their
burden
on
the
ground
you
get
into
trouble
objected
one
jesús
in
the
sacristy
they
leave
him
in
a
corner
among
after
magdalena
came
the
women
they
differed
from
the
men
in
arrangement
instead
of
the
children
the
old
women
came
first
and
finally
the
unmarried
women
behind
these
came
the
car
of
the
virgin
and
behind
that
the
curate
under
his
canopy
father
dámaso
gave
the
following
reason
for
putting
the
young
women
next
to
the
car
the
virgin
likes
young
women
but
not
old
ones
of
course
this
explanation
caused
many
of
the
older
women
to
make
wry
faces
but
that
did
not
change
the
taste
of
the
virgin
san
diego
followed
magdalena
but
he
did
not
seem
to
rejoice
over
the
fact
for
he
was
as
precise
in
his
behavior
as
on
the
morning
when
he
followed
along
behind
san
francisco
six
brothers
of
the
third
order
drew
the
car
san
diego
stopped
before
the
platform
and
awaited
for
the
people
to
salute
him
but
it
was
necessary
to
await
the
car
which
contained
the
image
of
the
virgin
preceding
this
car
were
some
people
dressed
in
a
fantastic
manner
which
made
children
cry
and
babies
scream
in
the
midst
of
that
dark
mass
of
habits
hoods
and
girdles
to
the
sound
of
that
monotonous
and
nasal
prayer
one
could
see
like
white
jessamine
like
fresh
pansies
among
old
rags
twelve
young
lassies
dressed
in
white
crowned
with
flowers
with
hair
curled
and
eyes
bright
as
the
necklaces
they
wore
seizing
hold
of
two
wide
blue
bands
which
were
tied
to
the
car
of
the
virgin
they
drew
it
along
reminding
one
of
doves
drawing
the
car
of
spring
and
now
when
the
images
were
all
attentive
when
this
child
and
that
had
been
slapped
sufficiently
to
make
him
listen
to
the
verses
when
everybody
had
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
half
open
curtain
at
last
an
aaaah
of
admiration
escaped
from
the
lips
of
all
and
the
sight
merited
it
a
young
child
appeared
with
wings
riding
boots
a
cordon
over
its
shoulder
a
belt
and
a
plumed
hat
the
señor
alcalde
cried
some
one
but
the
young
prodigy
recited
a
poem
in
such
a
manner
that
the
alcalde
was
not
offended
at
the
comparison
the
procession
then
continued
san
juan
followed
out
his
bitter
career
as
the
virgin
passed
before
the
house
of
captain
tiago
a
heavenly
song
greeted
her
like
the
words
of
an
archangel
it
was
a
sweet
melodious
supplicating
voice
weeping
the
ave
maria
of
gounod
the
music
of
the
procession
was
silenced
the
praying
ceased
and
father
salví
himself
stopped
the
voice
trembled
and
brought
tears
to
the
cheeks
of
those
who
heard
it
that
voice
expressed
more
than
a
salutation
a
prayer
or
a
plaint
from
the
window
where
he
was
viewing
the
procession
ibarra
heard
the
voice
and
melancholy
took
possession
of
his
heart
he
understood
what
that
soul
was
suffering
and
what
was
expressed
in
that
song
he
was
afraid
to
think
of
the
cause
of
that
grief
the
governor
general
found
him
pensive
and
sad
chapter
xxi
doña
consolacion
why
were
the
windows
in
the
alferez
house
closed
where
was
the
masculine
face
and
the
flannel
shirt
of
the
medusa
or
muse
of
the
civil
guard
while
the
procession
was
passing
could
she
have
understood
how
unpleasant
was
the
sight
of
the
swelling
veins
of
her
forehead
filled
it
seemed
not
with
blood
but
with
vinegar
and
bile
of
her
large
cigar
that
worthy
ornament
of
her
red
lips
and
of
her
envious
look
could
she
have
understood
all
of
that
and
giving
way
to
a
generous
impulse
have
refrained
from
disturbing
the
gayety
of
the
crowd
by
her
sinister
apparition
alas
her
generous
impulses
lived
only
in
the
golden
age
her
house
was
sad
because
other
people
were
merry
as
sinang
put
it
there
neither
lanterns
nor
flags
could
be
seen
in
fact
if
the
sentry
were
not
walking
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
gate
you
would
have
said
that
the
house
was
unoccupied
a
feeble
light
illumined
the
disarranged
sala
and
made
transparent
the
windows
filled
with
and
covered
with
dust
the
señora
according
to
her
custom
her
hands
folded
sat
in
a
wide
she
was
dressed
the
same
as
every
day
that
is
to
say
outrageously
out
of
taste
in
detail
she
had
a
handkerchief
tied
around
her
head
while
short
slender
locks
of
tangled
hair
hung
down
on
either
side
a
blue
flannel
shirt
over
another
shirt
which
should
have
been
white
and
a
skirt
which
moulded
itself
to
her
slender
thighs
as
she
sat
with
her
legs
crossed
and
nervously
wiggled
her
foot
from
her
mouth
came
big
puffs
of
smoke
which
she
fastidiously
blew
up
in
the
space
toward
which
she
looked
when
her
eyes
were
open
that
morning
the
señora
had
not
heard
mass
not
because
she
had
not
cared
to
hear
it
for
on
the
contrary
she
wanted
to
show
herself
to
the
multitude
and
to
hear
the
sermon
but
because
her
husband
had
not
permitted
her
to
do
so
as
was
usually
the
case
his
prohibition
was
accompanied
by
two
or
three
insults
oaths
and
threats
of
kicking
the
alferez
understood
that
his
female
dressed
herself
in
a
ridiculous
manner
and
that
it
was
not
fitting
to
expose
her
to
the
eyes
of
the
people
from
the
capital
nor
even
the
country
districts
but
she
did
not
understand
it
that
way
she
knew
that
she
was
beautiful
attractive
that
she
had
the
manners
of
a
queen
and
that
she
dressed
much
better
and
more
gorgeously
than
maria
clara
herself
though
to
be
sure
the
latter
wore
a
tapis
over
her
skirt
while
she
wore
only
the
skirt
the
alferez
had
to
say
to
her
oh
shut
your
mouth
or
i
kick
you
till
you
do
doña
consolacion
did
not
care
to
be
kicked
but
she
planned
revenge
the
dark
face
of
the
señora
never
had
inspired
confidence
in
anybody
not
even
when
she
painted
it
that
morning
she
was
exceptionally
uneasy
and
as
she
walked
from
one
end
of
the
sala
to
the
other
in
silence
and
as
if
meditating
something
terrible
her
eyes
shone
like
those
of
a
serpent
about
to
be
crushed
her
look
was
cold
luminous
and
penetrating
and
had
something
vicious
loathsome
and
cruel
in
it
the
slightest
defect
in
anything
the
most
insignificant
or
unusual
noise
brought
forth
an
obscene
and
infamous
expression
but
no
one
responded
to
offer
an
excuse
was
a
crime
so
the
day
passed
encountering
no
obstacle
in
her
way
her
husband
had
been
invited
out
she
became
saturated
with
bile
everything
around
bent
itself
before
her
she
met
no
resistance
there
was
nothing
upon
which
she
could
discharge
the
vials
of
her
wrath
soldiers
and
servants
crawled
before
her
that
she
might
not
hear
the
rejoicing
going
on
outside
she
ordered
the
windows
to
be
closed
and
charged
the
sentry
not
to
permit
any
one
to
enter
she
tied
a
handkerchief
around
her
head
to
prevent
it
from
bursting
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
sun
was
still
shining
brightly
she
ordered
the
lamps
lighted
a
madwoman
who
had
been
detained
for
disturbing
the
public
peace
was
taken
to
the
barracks
the
alferez
was
not
there
at
the
time
and
the
unhappy
woman
had
to
pass
the
night
seated
on
a
bench
the
following
day
the
alferez
returned
fearing
lest
the
unhappy
woman
should
become
the
butt
of
the
crowd
during
the
fiesta
he
ordered
the
soldiers
who
were
guarding
her
to
treat
her
with
pity
and
give
her
something
to
eat
thus
the
demented
woman
passed
two
days
whether
the
proximity
to
captain
tiago
house
made
it
possible
for
the
sad
song
of
maria
clara
to
reach
her
ears
whether
other
strains
of
music
awoke
in
her
memories
of
old
songs
or
whether
there
was
some
other
cause
for
it
at
any
rate
the
madwoman
began
that
night
to
sing
with
a
sweet
and
melancholy
voice
the
songs
of
her
youth
the
soldiers
heard
her
and
kept
silent
those
songs
brought
back
memories
of
the
old
times
doña
consolacion
also
heard
it
in
her
sorrow
and
became
interested
in
the
person
who
was
singing
tell
her
to
come
upstairs
at
once
she
ordered
after
some
seconds
of
meditation
something
like
a
smile
passed
over
her
dry
lips
they
brought
the
woman
and
she
presented
herself
without
any
discomposure
and
without
manifesting
either
fear
or
surprise
orderly
tell
this
woman
in
tagalog
to
sing
said
the
alfereza
she
do
understand
me
she
does
not
know
spanish
the
demented
woman
understood
the
orderly
and
sang
the
song
night
doña
consolacion
listened
to
the
beginning
with
a
mocking
smile
which
disappeared
gradually
from
her
lips
she
became
attentive
then
more
serious
and
pensive
the
woman
voice
the
sentiment
of
the
verses
and
the
song
itself
impressed
her
that
dry
and
burning
heart
was
perhaps
softened
she
understood
the
song
well
sadness
cold
and
dampness
wrapped
in
the
mantle
of
night
descend
from
the
sky
as
the
folk
song
puts
it
it
seemed
that
they
were
also
descending
upon
her
heart
the
withered
flower
which
during
the
day
has
paraded
its
dress
desirous
of
applause
and
full
of
vanity
at
nightfall
repenting
makes
an
effort
to
raise
its
faded
petals
to
the
sky
and
begs
for
a
little
shade
in
which
to
hide
itself
so
as
to
die
without
the
mockery
of
the
light
which
saw
it
in
its
pomp
to
die
without
the
vanity
of
its
pride
being
seen
and
begging
for
a
drop
of
dew
to
weep
over
it
the
night
bird
leaving
its
solitary
retreat
in
the
hollow
of
the
old
tree
disturbs
the
melancholy
of
the
forests
no
no
do
not
sing
exclaimed
the
alfereza
in
perfect
tagalog
and
raising
to
her
feet
somewhat
agitated
do
sing
those
verses
hurt
me
the
demented
woman
stopped
the
orderly
muttered
bah
and
exclaimed
she
knows
how
to
patá
tagalog
and
stood
looking
at
the
señora
full
of
surprise
the
muse
understood
that
she
had
been
caught
and
was
ashamed
as
her
nature
was
not
that
of
a
woman
her
shame
took
the
form
of
rage
and
hatred
she
pointed
out
the
door
to
the
impudent
orderly
and
with
a
kick
closed
it
behind
him
she
took
several
turns
about
the
room
twisting
a
whip
between
her
nervous
hands
and
then
stopping
suddenly
in
front
of
the
demented
woman
said
in
spanish
dance
the
demented
one
did
not
move
dance
dance
she
repeated
in
a
threatening
voice
the
poor
woman
looked
at
the
señora
her
eyes
devoid
of
expression
the
alfereza
raised
one
arm
and
then
the
other
shaking
them
in
a
menacing
way
she
then
leaped
up
in
the
air
and
jumped
around
urging
the
other
woman
to
imitate
her
the
band
in
the
procession
could
be
heard
playing
a
slow
majestic
march
but
the
señora
leaping
about
furiously
was
keeping
time
to
different
music
than
that
the
band
was
playing
that
music
which
resounded
within
her
a
curious
look
appeared
in
the
madwoman
eyes
and
a
weak
smile
moved
her
pale
lips
she
liked
the
señora
dancing
the
alfereza
stopped
dancing
as
if
ashamed
she
raised
the
whip
that
terrible
whip
made
in
ulango
and
improved
by
the
alferez
by
winding
wire
around
it
that
same
terrible
whip
which
the
ladrones
and
soldiers
knew
so
well
now
it
is
your
turn
to
dance
dance
and
she
began
to
whip
lightly
the
demented
woman
bare
feet
the
pale
face
contracted
with
pain
and
she
was
obliged
to
defend
herself
from
the
blows
by
her
hands
come
go
ahead
she
exclaimed
with
savage
delight
and
she
passed
from
lento
to
in
the
use
of
her
whip
the
unhappy
woman
screamed
and
quickly
raised
her
feet
you
have
got
to
dance
you
d
d
indian
exclaimed
the
señora
and
the
whip
whizzed
and
whistled
the
woman
let
herself
sink
to
the
floor
and
tried
to
cover
her
legs
with
her
hands
at
the
same
time
looking
with
wild
eyes
at
her
tormentor
two
heavy
lashes
on
her
back
made
her
rise
again
now
it
was
no
longer
a
scream
it
was
a
howl
which
escaped
from
the
unfortunate
woman
the
thin
shirt
was
torn
the
skin
broke
open
and
the
blood
oozed
out
the
sight
of
blood
excites
a
tiger
so
too
the
sight
of
the
blood
of
her
victim
infuriated
doña
consolacion
dance
dance
curse
you
d
n
you
dance
cursed
be
the
mother
who
bore
you
she
cried
dance
or
i
kill
you
by
whipping
you
to
death
then
the
alfereza
taking
the
woman
with
one
hand
and
whipping
her
with
another
began
to
jump
and
dance
the
insane
woman
understood
her
at
last
and
went
on
moving
her
arms
regardless
of
time
or
tune
a
smile
of
satisfaction
contracted
the
lips
of
the
teacher
it
was
like
the
smile
of
a
female
mephistopheles
who
had
succeeded
in
developing
a
good
pupil
it
was
full
of
hatred
contempt
mockery
and
cruelty
a
coarse
laugh
could
not
have
expressed
more
absorbed
in
the
enjoyment
which
the
spectacle
afforded
her
she
did
not
hear
her
husband
coming
until
he
opened
the
door
with
a
kick
the
alferez
appeared
pale
and
gloomy
he
saw
what
was
going
on
there
and
looked
daggers
at
his
wife
she
did
not
move
from
her
tracks
and
stood
smiling
in
a
cynical
way
in
the
gentlest
manner
possible
he
put
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
dancing
woman
and
made
her
stop
the
demented
woman
sighed
and
slowly
sat
down
on
the
floor
the
silence
continued
the
alferez
was
breathing
heavily
his
wife
was
observing
him
with
her
questioning
eyes
she
seized
the
whip
and
in
a
calm
and
measured
tone
asked
him
what
the
matter
with
you
you
have
not
said
evening
to
me
the
alferez
without
replying
called
the
orderly
take
this
woman
he
said
and
have
marta
give
her
another
shirt
and
take
care
of
her
find
her
good
food
and
a
good
bed
let
him
look
out
who
treats
her
badly
after
carefully
closing
the
door
he
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
approached
his
señora
you
want
me
to
smash
you
he
said
clenching
his
fists
what
the
matter
with
you
asked
she
retreating
a
step
or
two
what
the
matter
with
me
he
shouted
in
a
thundering
voice
and
giving
vent
to
an
oath
showed
her
a
paper
covered
with
scribbling
he
continued
did
you
write
this
letter
to
the
alcalde
saying
that
i
am
paid
for
permitting
the
gambling
d
n
you
i
do
know
how
i
can
keep
from
smashing
you
go
ahead
try
it
if
you
dare
said
she
with
a
mocking
smile
he
who
smashes
me
has
got
to
be
more
of
a
man
than
you
he
heard
the
insult
but
he
saw
the
whip
he
seized
one
of
the
plates
which
were
on
the
table
and
threw
it
at
her
head
the
woman
accustomed
to
these
fights
ducked
quickly
and
the
plate
was
shivered
to
pieces
against
the
wall
a
glass
a
cup
and
a
knife
shared
the
same
fortune
coward
she
cried
you
dare
not
come
near
me
and
then
she
spat
at
him
to
exasperate
him
more
the
man
blind
and
howling
with
rage
threw
himself
on
her
but
she
with
wonderful
rapidity
struck
him
a
few
blows
across
the
face
with
the
whip
and
quickly
escaped
closing
the
door
of
her
room
with
a
slam
she
locked
herself
in
roaring
with
rage
and
pain
the
alferez
followed
her
but
coming
up
against
the
door
he
could
do
nothing
but
belch
forth
a
string
of
blasphemies
cursed
be
your
ancestors
you
swine
open
d
n
you
open
that
door
or
i
break
your
skull
he
howled
pounding
and
kicking
the
panels
doña
consolacion
did
not
reply
a
moving
of
chairs
and
trunks
could
be
heard
as
though
some
one
was
trying
to
raise
a
barricade
of
household
furniture
the
house
fairly
shook
with
the
oaths
and
kicks
of
the
husband
do
you
come
in
do
you
come
in
she
said
in
a
bitter
voice
if
you
show
yourself
i
shoot
you
the
husband
calmed
down
little
by
little
and
contented
himself
with
pacing
from
one
end
of
the
sala
to
the
other
like
a
wild
animal
in
its
cage
go
and
cool
your
head
continued
the
woman
in
mockery
she
seemed
to
have
concluded
her
preparations
for
defense
i
swear
that
when
i
catch
you
no
one
not
even
god
will
see
you
again
i
smash
you
so
fine
yes
now
you
can
say
what
you
wish
you
would
not
let
me
go
to
mass
you
would
not
let
me
fulfill
my
duty
to
god
she
said
with
such
sarcasm
as
she
alone
knew
how
to
use
the
alferez
took
his
helmet
straightened
out
his
clothes
and
walked
away
several
paces
but
at
the
end
of
several
minutes
he
returned
without
making
the
slightest
noise
for
he
had
taken
off
his
boots
the
servants
accustomed
to
these
spectacles
paid
no
attention
to
them
but
the
novelty
of
this
move
with
the
boots
attracted
their
notice
and
they
gave
each
other
the
wink
the
alferez
sat
down
on
a
chair
next
to
the
door
and
had
the
patience
to
wait
more
than
half
an
hour
have
you
really
gone
out
or
are
you
there
you
asked
a
voice
from
time
to
time
changing
the
epithets
but
raising
the
tone
finally
she
commenced
to
take
away
the
furniture
from
her
barricade
he
heard
the
noise
and
smiled
orderly
has
the
señor
gone
out
cried
doña
consolacion
the
orderly
at
a
signal
from
the
alferez
replied
yes
señora
he
has
gone
out
he
could
hear
her
laugh
triumphantly
she
drew
back
the
bolt
the
husband
arose
to
his
feet
slowly
the
door
was
opened
a
cry
the
noise
of
a
body
falling
oaths
howling
swearing
blows
hoarse
voices
who
can
describe
what
took
place
in
the
darkness
of
the
bedroom
the
orderly
going
out
to
the
kitchen
made
a
very
expressive
gesture
to
the
cook
and
now
you
catch
it
said
the
latter
i
no
sir
the
town
will
not
i
she
asked
me
if
he
had
gone
out
not
if
he
had
returned
chapter
xxii
might
and
right
it
was
about
ten
at
night
the
last
rockets
lazily
soared
into
the
dark
sky
where
paper
balloons
shone
like
new
stars
some
of
the
fireworks
had
set
fire
to
houses
and
were
threatening
them
with
destruction
for
this
reason
men
could
be
seen
on
the
ridges
of
the
roofs
carrying
buckets
of
water
and
long
bamboo
poles
with
cloths
tied
on
the
ends
their
dark
shadows
seemed
descended
from
ethereal
space
to
be
present
at
the
rejoicings
of
human
beings
an
enormous
number
of
wheels
had
been
burned
also
castles
bulls
caraboas
and
other
pieces
of
fireworks
and
finally
a
great
volcano
which
surpassed
in
beauty
and
grandeur
anything
that
the
inhabitants
of
san
diego
had
ever
seen
now
the
people
turned
in
one
great
crowd
toward
the
plaza
to
attend
the
last
theatrical
performance
here
and
there
could
be
seen
the
colored
bengal
lights
fantastically
illuminating
groups
of
merry
people
the
small
boys
were
making
use
of
their
torches
to
search
for
unexploded
firecrackers
in
the
grass
or
in
fact
for
anything
else
that
might
be
of
use
to
them
but
the
music
was
the
signal
and
all
abandoned
the
lawn
for
the
theatre
the
large
platform
was
splendidly
illuminated
thousands
of
lights
surrounded
the
pillars
and
hung
from
the
roof
while
a
number
in
groups
were
arranged
on
the
floor
of
the
stage
an
employee
attended
to
these
and
whenever
he
would
come
forward
to
regulate
them
the
public
would
whistle
at
him
and
shout
there
he
is
there
he
is
now
in
front
of
the
stage
the
orchestra
tuned
its
instruments
and
behind
the
musicians
sat
the
principal
people
of
the
town
spaniards
and
rich
visitors
were
occupying
the
reserved
chairs
the
public
the
mass
of
people
without
titles
or
rank
filled
the
rest
of
the
plaza
some
carried
with
them
benches
not
so
much
for
seats
as
to
remedy
their
lack
of
stature
when
they
stood
upon
them
rude
protests
were
made
on
the
part
of
those
without
benches
or
things
to
stand
on
then
they
would
get
down
immediately
but
soon
mount
up
on
their
pedestals
again
as
if
nothing
had
happened
comings
and
goings
cries
exclamations
laughter
squibs
that
had
been
slow
in
going
off
and
firecrackers
increased
the
tumult
here
a
foot
broke
through
a
bench
and
some
one
fell
to
the
floor
while
the
crowd
laughed
and
made
a
show
of
him
who
had
come
so
far
to
see
a
show
there
they
fought
and
disputed
over
positions
and
a
little
farther
on
the
noise
of
breaking
bottles
and
glasses
could
be
heard
it
was
andeng
she
was
carrying
drinks
and
refreshments
on
a
tray
which
she
was
balancing
with
both
hands
but
she
had
met
her
lover
and
he
tried
to
take
advantage
of
her
helplessness
by
tickling
the
teniente
mayor
presided
at
the
production
since
the
gobernadorcillo
was
fonder
of
monte
maria
clara
and
her
friends
had
arrived
and
don
filipo
received
them
and
accompanied
them
to
their
seats
behind
came
the
curate
with
another
franciscan
and
some
spaniards
with
the
curate
were
some
other
people
who
make
it
their
business
to
escort
the
friars
may
god
reward
them
in
another
life
said
the
old
man
referring
to
them
as
he
walked
away
from
maria
clara
party
the
performance
began
with
chananay
and
marianito
in
crispinoé
la
comare
everybody
had
eyes
and
ears
intent
upon
the
stage
except
one
father
salví
he
seemed
to
have
come
to
the
theatre
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
watch
maria
clara
whose
sadness
gave
to
her
beauty
an
air
so
ideal
and
interesting
that
everybody
looked
upon
her
with
rapture
but
the
franciscan
eyes
deeply
hidden
in
their
hollow
orbits
spoke
no
words
of
rapture
in
that
sombre
look
one
could
read
something
desperately
sad
with
such
eyes
cain
might
have
contemplated
from
afar
the
paradise
whose
delights
his
mother
had
pictured
to
him
the
act
was
just
ending
when
ibarra
arrived
his
presence
occasioned
a
buzz
of
conversation
the
attention
of
everybody
was
fixed
on
him
and
on
the
curate
but
the
young
man
did
not
seem
to
be
aware
of
it
for
he
greeted
maria
clara
and
her
friends
with
naturalness
and
sat
down
at
their
side
the
only
one
who
spoke
was
sinang
did
you
see
the
volcano
when
they
touched
it
off
she
asked
no
my
little
friend
i
had
to
accompany
the
governor
general
well
that
is
too
bad
the
curate
came
with
us
and
he
was
telling
us
stories
about
condemned
people
what
do
you
think
does
he
do
it
to
make
us
afraid
so
that
we
can
not
enjoy
ourselves
how
does
it
appear
to
you
the
curate
arose
and
approached
don
filipo
with
whom
he
seemed
to
be
having
a
lively
discussion
he
was
speaking
with
animation
and
don
filipo
replying
with
moderation
and
in
a
low
voice
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
please
your
reverence
said
the
latter
señor
ibarra
is
one
of
the
heaviest
and
has
a
right
to
sit
here
as
long
as
he
does
not
disturb
the
public
order
but
is
not
scandalizing
good
christians
disturbing
the
public
order
you
let
a
wolf
into
the
flock
you
will
be
held
responsible
for
this
before
god
and
before
the
authorities
of
the
town
i
always
hold
myself
responsible
for
acts
which
emanate
from
my
own
will
father
replied
don
filipo
slightly
inclining
his
head
but
my
little
authority
does
not
give
me
power
to
meddle
in
religious
affairs
those
who
wish
to
avoid
contact
with
him
do
not
have
to
speak
to
him
señor
ibarra
does
not
force
himself
on
any
one
but
he
affords
danger
he
who
loves
danger
perishes
in
it
i
do
see
any
danger
father
the
alcalde
and
the
governor
general
my
superiors
have
been
talking
with
him
all
the
afternoon
and
it
is
not
for
me
to
give
them
a
lesson
if
you
do
put
him
out
of
here
we
will
leave
i
am
very
very
sorry
but
i
can
not
put
any
one
out
of
here
the
curate
repented
having
said
what
he
did
but
now
there
was
no
alternative
he
made
a
signal
to
his
companion
who
laboriously
rose
to
his
feet
and
both
went
out
the
persons
attached
to
the
friars
imitated
the
priests
not
however
without
first
glancing
with
hatred
at
ibarra
murmurs
and
whispers
increased
then
various
persons
approached
and
saluted
the
young
man
and
said
we
are
with
you
take
no
notice
of
them
who
are
he
asked
with
surprise
those
who
have
gone
out
in
order
to
avoid
contact
with
you
to
avoid
contact
with
me
contact
with
me
yes
they
say
that
you
are
excommunicated
ibarra
surprised
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
looked
around
him
he
saw
maria
clara
who
was
hiding
her
face
behind
her
fan
but
is
it
possible
he
exclaimed
at
last
are
we
still
in
the
darkness
of
the
middle
ages
so
that
and
turning
to
the
young
women
and
changing
his
tone
he
said
excuse
me
i
have
forgotten
an
appointment
i
will
return
to
accompany
you
home
stay
said
sinang
yeyeng
is
going
to
dance
in
the
calandria
she
dances
divinely
i
can
not
my
little
friend
but
i
will
certainly
return
the
murmurs
increased
while
yeyeng
dressed
in
the
style
of
the
lower
class
of
madrid
was
coming
on
the
stage
with
the
remark
da
usté
su
permiso
do
you
give
your
permission
and
as
carvajal
was
replying
to
her
pase
usté
adelante
pass
forward
two
soldiers
of
the
civil
guard
approached
don
filipo
asking
him
to
suspend
the
performance
and
what
for
asked
he
surprised
at
the
request
because
the
alferez
and
his
señora
have
been
fighting
and
they
can
not
sleep
you
tell
the
alferez
that
we
have
permission
from
the
alcalde
and
that
no
one
in
the
town
has
any
authority
over
him
not
even
the
gobernadorcillo
who
is
my
well
you
will
have
to
suspend
the
performance
repeated
the
soldiers
don
filipo
turned
his
back
to
them
the
guards
marched
off
in
order
not
to
disturb
the
general
tranquillity
don
filipo
said
not
a
word
about
the
matter
to
any
one
after
a
piece
of
light
opera
which
was
heartily
applauded
the
prince
villardo
presented
himself
on
the
stage
and
challenged
all
the
moros
who
had
imprisoned
his
father
to
a
fight
the
hero
threatened
to
cut
off
all
their
heads
at
a
single
blow
and
to
send
them
all
to
the
moon
fortunately
for
the
moros
who
were
making
ready
to
fight
to
the
tune
of
the
riego
hymn
a
tumult
intervened
all
of
a
sudden
the
orchestra
stopped
playing
and
the
musicians
made
a
rush
for
the
stage
throwing
their
instruments
in
all
directions
the
brave
villardo
was
not
expecting
such
a
move
and
taking
them
for
allies
of
the
moros
he
also
threw
down
his
sword
and
shield
and
began
to
run
the
moros
seeing
this
terrible
giant
fleeing
found
it
convenient
to
imitate
him
cries
sighs
imprecations
and
blasphemies
filled
the
air
the
people
ran
trampled
over
each
other
the
lights
were
put
out
and
the
glass
lamps
with
their
cocoanut
oil
and
little
wicks
were
flying
through
the
air
tulisanes
tulisanes
cried
some
fire
fire
ladrones
cried
others
women
and
children
wept
chairs
and
spectators
were
rolled
over
on
the
floor
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
rush
and
tumult
what
has
happened
two
civil
guards
with
sticks
in
hand
had
gone
after
the
musicians
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
the
spectacle
the
teniente
mayor
with
the
cuaderilleros
armed
with
their
old
sabers
had
managed
to
arrest
the
two
civil
guards
in
spite
of
their
resistance
take
them
to
the
tribunal
shouted
don
filipo
be
careful
not
to
let
them
get
away
ibarra
had
returned
and
had
sought
out
maria
clara
the
terrified
young
maidens
trembling
and
pale
were
clinging
closely
to
him
aunt
isabel
was
reciting
the
litanies
in
latin
the
crowd
having
recovered
a
little
from
the
fright
and
some
one
having
explained
what
had
caused
the
rush
and
tumult
indignation
arose
in
everyone
breast
stones
rained
upon
the
civil
guards
who
were
being
conducted
to
the
tribunal
by
the
cuaderilleros
some
one
proposed
that
they
burn
the
barracks
of
the
civil
guards
and
that
they
roast
doña
consolacion
and
the
alferez
alive
that
is
all
that
they
are
good
for
cried
a
woman
rolling
up
her
sleeves
and
stretching
out
her
arms
they
can
disturb
the
people
but
they
persecute
none
but
honorable
men
they
do
nothing
with
the
tulisanes
and
the
gamblers
look
at
them
let
us
burn
the
cuartel
somebody
had
been
wounded
in
the
arm
and
was
asking
for
confession
a
plaintive
voice
was
heard
coming
from
under
an
upset
bench
it
was
a
poor
musician
the
stage
was
filled
with
the
players
and
people
of
the
town
and
they
were
all
talking
at
the
same
time
there
was
chananay
dressed
in
the
costume
of
leonor
in
the
trovador
talking
in
corrupted
spanish
with
ratia
who
was
in
a
school
costume
there
too
was
yeyeng
dressed
in
a
silk
wrapper
talking
with
the
prince
villardo
there
too
balbino
and
the
moros
trying
to
console
the
musicians
who
were
more
or
less
sorry
sights
some
spaniards
were
walking
from
one
place
to
another
arguing
with
every
one
they
met
but
a
nucleus
for
a
mob
already
formed
don
filipo
knew
what
was
their
intention
and
tried
to
stop
them
do
not
break
the
peace
he
shouted
we
will
demand
satisfaction
we
will
have
justice
i
will
take
the
responsibility
for
our
getting
justice
no
some
replied
they
did
the
same
thing
in
calamba
the
same
thing
was
promised
but
the
alcalde
did
nothing
we
want
justice
done
by
our
own
hands
to
the
cuartel
in
vain
the
teniente
mayor
argued
with
them
the
group
that
had
gathered
showed
no
signs
of
changing
its
attitude
or
purpose
don
filipo
looked
about
him
in
search
of
help
he
saw
ibarra
señor
ibarra
for
my
sake
as
a
favor
hold
them
while
i
seek
some
cuaderilleros
what
can
i
do
asked
the
young
man
perplexed
but
the
teniente
mayor
was
already
in
the
distance
ibarra
in
turn
looked
about
him
for
he
knew
not
whom
fortunately
he
thought
he
discerned
elias
in
the
crowd
but
not
taking
an
active
part
in
it
ibarra
ran
up
to
him
seized
his
arm
and
said
to
him
in
spanish
for
heaven
sake
do
something
if
you
can
i
can
not
do
anything
the
pilot
must
have
understood
for
he
lost
himself
in
the
mob
lively
discussions
were
heard
mingled
with
strong
interjections
soon
the
mob
began
to
disperse
each
one
of
the
participants
becoming
less
hostile
and
it
was
time
for
them
to
do
so
for
the
cuaderilleros
were
coming
to
the
scene
with
fixed
bayonets
in
the
meantime
what
was
the
curate
doing
father
salví
had
not
gone
to
bed
standing
on
foot
immovable
and
leaning
his
face
against
the
shutter
he
was
looking
toward
the
plaza
and
from
time
to
time
a
suppressed
sigh
escaped
his
breast
if
the
light
of
his
lamp
had
not
been
so
dim
perhaps
one
might
have
seen
that
his
eyes
were
filling
with
tears
thus
he
stood
for
almost
an
hour
the
tumult
in
the
plaza
roused
him
from
this
state
full
of
surprise
he
followed
with
his
eyes
the
people
as
they
rushed
to
and
fro
in
confusion
their
voices
and
cries
he
could
vaguely
hear
even
at
that
distance
one
of
the
servants
came
running
in
breathlessly
and
informed
him
what
was
going
on
a
thought
entered
his
mind
amid
confusion
and
tumult
libertines
take
advantage
of
the
fright
and
the
weakness
of
woman
all
flee
to
save
themselves
nobody
thinks
of
anyone
else
the
women
faint
and
their
cries
are
not
heard
they
fall
are
trampled
over
fear
and
fright
overcome
modesty
and
under
cover
of
darkness
he
fancied
he
could
see
ibarra
carrying
maria
clara
fainting
in
his
arms
and
then
disappearing
in
the
darkness
with
leaps
and
bounds
he
went
down
the
stairs
without
hat
or
cane
and
almost
like
a
crazy
person
turned
toward
the
plaza
there
he
found
some
spaniards
reproving
the
soldiers
he
looked
toward
the

maria

and
her
friends
had
been
occupying

that
they
were

father
curate
father
curate
shouted
the
spaniards
to
him
but
he
took
no
notice
and
ran
on
in
the
direction
of
the
house
of
captain
tiago
there
he
recovered
his
breath
he
saw
through
the
transparent
shade
a
shadow
that
adorable
shadow
so
graceful
and
delicate
in
its
contour
that
of
maria
clara
he
could
also
see
another
shadow
that
of
her
aunt
carrying
cups
and
glasses
well
he
muttered
to
himself
it
seems
that
she
has
only
fallen
aunt
isabel
afterward
closed
the
shell
windows
and
the
graceful
shadow
could
no
longer
be
seen
the
curate
walked
away
from
there
without
seeing
the
crowd
he
was
looking
at
the
bust
of
a
beautiful
maiden
which
he
had
before
his
eyes
a
maiden
sleeping
and
breathing
sweetly
her
eyelids
were
shaded
by
long
lashes
which
formed
graceful
curves
like
those
on
virgins
her
small
mouth
was
smiling
and
her
whole
countenance
seemed
to
breathe
virginity
purity
and
innocence
that
sweet
face
of
hers
on
the
background
of
the
white
draperies
of
the
bed
was
a
vision
like
the
head
of
a
cherubim
among
the
clouds
his
impassioned
imagination
went
on
and
pictured
to
him
who
can
describe
all
that
a
burning
brain
can
conceive
chapter
xxiii
two
visitors
ibarra
found
his
mind
in
such
a
state
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
sleep
so
in
order
to
divert
himself
and
to
drive
away
the
gloomy
idea
which
distracted
his
mind
he
began
work
in
his
solitary
laboratory
morning
came
upon
him
still
at
work
making
mixtures
and
compounds
to
the
action
of
which
he
submitted
pieces
of
cane
and
other
substances
and
afterward
enclosed
them
in
numbered
and
sealed
flasks
a
servant
entered
announcing
the
arrival
of
a
peasant
let
him
enter
said
he
without
even
turning
to
look
elias
entered
and
remained
standing
in
silence
ah
is
it
you
ibarra
exclaimed
in
tagalog
on
recognizing
him
excuse
me
if
i
have
kept
you
waiting
i
was
not
aware
of
your
presence
i
was
making
an
important
experiment
i
do
not
wish
to
disturb
you
replied
the
young
pilot
i
have
come
in
the
first
place
to
ask
you
if
you
want
anything
from
the
province
of
batangas
whither
i
am
going
now
and
in
the
second
place
to
give
you
some
bad
news
ibarra
looked
inquiringly
at
the
pilot
the
daughter
of
captain
tiago
is
ill
added
elias
quietly
but
the
illness
is
not
serious
i
had
already
feared
it
responded
ibarra
do
you
know
what
the
illness
is
a
fever
now
if
you
have
nothing
to
order
thanks
my
friend
i
wish
you
a
good
journey
but
before
you
go
permit
me
to
ask
you
a
question
if
it
is
indiscreet
do
not
answer
me
elias
bowed
how
were
you
able
to
quiet
the
mob
last
night
asked
ibarra
fixing
his
eyes
on
him
in
a
very
simple
way
replied
elias
with
entire
frankness
at
the
head
of
it
were
two
brothers
whose
father
died
from
the
effects
of
a
whipping
at
the
hands
of
the
civil
guard
one
day
i
had
the
fortune
to
save
them
from
the
same
hands
into
which
their
father
fell
and
for
this
both
are
under
obligations
to
me
last
night
i
went
to
them
and
requested
them
to
dissuade
the
others
from
their
purpose
and
those
two
brothers
whose
father
died
by
being
whipped
to
death
they
will
end
their
lives
in
the
same
way
replied
elias
in
a
low
voice
when
adversity
has
marked
itself
once
on
a
family
all
the
members
have
to
perish
when
the
lightning
strikes
a
tree
it
reduces
it
all
to
ashes
and
elias
seeing
that
ibarra
was
silent
took
his
leave
the
latter
on
finding
himself
alone
lost
the
serenity
of
countenance
which
he
had
preserved
in
the
presence
of
the
pilot
and
grief
manifested
itself
in
his
face
i
i
have
made
her
suffer
he
muttered
he
quickly
dressed
himself
and
descended
the
stairs
a
little
man
dressed
in
mourning
with
a
large
scar
on
his
left
cheek
meekly
saluted
him
stopping
him
on
his
way
what
do
you
wish
ibarra
asked
him
señor
my
name
is
lucas
i
am
the
brother
of
the
man
who
was
killed
yesterday
during
the
ceremony
when
the
stone
was
being
laid
ah
you
have
my
sympathy
and
well
señor
i
wish
to
know
how
much
you
are
going
to
pay
my
family
how
much
i
am
going
to
pay
repeated
the
young
man
without
being
able
to
conceal
a
bored
expression
we
will
talk
that
over
come
back
this
afternoon
for
i
am
busy
only
tell
me
how
much
you
are
going
to
pay
insisted
lucas
i
have
told
you
that
we
would
talk
about
that
some
other
time
too
busy
said
ibarra
impatiently
you
have
time
now
señor
asked
lucas
with
bitterness
and
putting
himself
in
front
of
the
young
man
you
do
not
have
time
to
occupy
yourself
about
the
dead
come
this
afternoon
my
good
fellow
repeated
ibarra
restraining
himself
i
have
to
go
and
see
a
sick
person
ah
and
you
forget
the
dead
for
a
sick
person
do
you
think
that
because
we
are
poor
ibarra
looked
at
him
and
cut
off
what
he
was
saying
do
try
my
patience
said
he
and
went
on
his
way
lucas
stood
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
on
his
face
full
of
hatred
you
do
not
know
that
you
are
a
grandson
of
the
man
who
exposed
my
father
to
the
sun
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
you
have
the
very
same
blood
in
your
veins
and
changing
his
tone
he
added
but
if
you
pay
well
we
are
friends
chapter
xxiv
episode
in
espadaña
life
the
festival
was
over
the
citizens
found
just
as
every
year
that
their
treasury
was
poorer
that
they
had
worked
perspired
and
stayed
up
nights
without
enjoying
themselves
without
acquiring
new
friends
and
in
a
word
had
paid
dearly
for
the
noise
and
their
headaches
but
it
did
not
matter
the
next
year
they
would
do
the
same
thing
and
the
same
for
the
coming
century
just
as
had
always
been
the
custom
to
the
present
time
enough
sadness
reigned
in
captain
tiago
house
all
the
windows
were
closed
the
people
scarcely
made
a
noise
and
no
one
dared
to
speak
except
in
the
kitchen
maria
clara
the
soul
of
the
house
lay
sick
in
her
bed
what
do
you
think
isabel
shall
i
make
a
donation
to
the
cross
of
tunasan
or
to
the
cross
of
matahong
asked
the
solicitous
father
in
a
low
voice
the
cross
of
tunasan
grows
but
that
of
matahong
sweats
which
do
you
think
is
the
most
miraculous
isabel
thought
for
a
moment
moved
her
head
and
murmured
to
grow
to
grow
is
more
miraculous
than
to
sweat
we
all
sweat
but
we
do
not
all
grow
that
is
true
yes
isabel
but
bear
in
mind
that
for
wood
to
sweat
when
it
is
made
into
the
leg
of
a
chair
is
no
small
miracle
well
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
give
alms
to
both
crosses
so
that
neither
will
feel
resentful
and
maria
clara
will
recover
more
quickly
are
the
rooms
in
good
order
you
know
that
a
new
señor
comes
with
the
doctors
a
relative
of
father
dámaso
by
marriage
it
is
necessary
that
nothing
be
lacking
the
two
cousins
sinang
and
victoria
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
they
had
come
to
keep
company
with
the
sick
maria
andeng
was
helping
them
clean
up
a
tea
service
in
order
to
serve
tea
do
you
know
doctor
espadaña
asked
maria
clara
foster
sister
directing
her
question
to
victoria
no
replied
the
latter
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
him
is
that
he
charges
very
dearly
according
to
captain
tiago
then
he
ought
to
be
very
good
said
andeng
the
one
who
performed
the
operation
on
the
stomach
of
doña
marta
charged
a
big
price
but
he
was
very
wise
you
goose
exclaimed
sinang
not
all
who
charge
high
prices
are
wise
look
at
doctor
guevara
he
did
not
know
how
to
aid
a
woman
in
childbirth
but
after
cutting
off
the
child
head
he
collected
one
hundred
pesos
from
the
widower
what
he
did
know
was
how
to
charge
what
do
you
know
about
it
her
cousin
asked
giving
her
a
jab
with
her
elbow
why
should
i
know
about
it
the
husband
who
is
a
after
losing
his
wife
had
to
lose
his
house
also
for
the
alcalde
was
a
friend
of
the
doctor
and
made
him
pay
why
should
i
know
my
father
loaned
him
money
so
that
he
could
make
a
trip
to
santa
cruz
a
coach
stopped
before
the
house
and
cut
off
all
the
conversation
captain
tiago
followed
by
aunt
isabel
ran
downstairs
to
receive
the
new
arrivals
they
were
the
doctor
don
tiburcio
de
espadaña
his
wife
doctora
doña
victorina
de
los
reyes
de
de
espadaña
and
a
young
spaniard
the
latter
had
a
sympathetic
face
and
a
pleasing
appearance
the
doctora
wore
a
silk
gown
embroidered
with
flowers
and
on
her
hat
a
large
parrot
half
crushed
among
trimmings
of
red
and
blue
ribbons
the
dust
of
the
road
had
mingled
with
the
rice
powder
on
her
cheeks
strongly
accentuating
her
wrinkles
she
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
lame
husband
i
have
the
pleasure
to
present
to
you
our
cousin
don
alfonso
linares
de
espadaña
said
doña
victorina
pointing
toward
the
young
man
the
gentleman
is
a
of
a
relative
of
father
dámaso
and
is
private
secretary
to
all
the
ministers
the
young
man
bowed
gracefully
captain
tiago
almost
kissed
his
hand
doña
victorina
was
a
woman
of
about
summers
which
according
to
her
arithmetical
calculations
was
equivalent
to
springs
she
had
been
pretty
in
her
youth
but
raging
over
her
own
beauty
she
had
looked
with
disdain
on
many
filipino
adorers
for
her
aspirations
were
for
the
other
race
she
had
not
cared
to
entrust
her
little
white
hand
to
anybody
but
this
not
on
account
of
lack
of
confidence
on
her
part
for
she
had
entrusted
rings
and
jewels
of
inestimable
value
to
various
foreign
adventurers
six
months
before
the
time
of
the
happenings
of
which
we
are
writing
she
saw
her
beautiful
dream
realized
that
dream
of
her
whole
life
on
account
of
which
she
had
disdained
all
manner
of
flattery
and
even
the
promises
of
love
which
had
been
cooed
into
her
ears
or
sung
in
serenades
by
captain
tiago
late
it
is
true
she
had
realized
her
dream
but
she
knew
well
the
proverb
better
late
than
never
and
consoled
herself
by
repeating
it
again
and
again
there
is
no
complete
happiness
on
this
earth
was
her
other
favorite
proverb
but
neither
of
these
ever
passed
her
lips
in
the
presence
of
other
people
doña
victorina
after
passing
her
first
second
third
and
fourth
youth
in
fishing
in
the
sea
of
men
for
the
object
of
her
dreams
had
at
last
to
content
herself
with
what
fortune
cared
to
give
her
the
poor
little
woman
if
she
instead
of
having
passed
springs
had
not
passed
more
than
the
difference
according
to
her
arithmetic
was
very
great
would
have
thrown
back
the
prize
which
destiny
offered
her
and
preferred
to
wait
for
another
more
in
conformity
with
her
tastes
but
as
the
man
proposed
and
necessity
disposed
it
so
for
she
needed
a
husband
very
badly
she
was
compelled
to
content
herself
with
a
poor
man
who
had
been
driven
by
necessity
to
leave
the
province
of
estremadura
in
spain
he
after
wandering
about
the
world
for
six
or
seven
months
a
modern
ulysses
found
at
last
in
the
island
of
luzon
hospitality
money
and
a
faded
calypso
his
better
half
but
alas
a
bitter
half
he
was
known
as
the
unhappy
tiburcio
espadaña
and
although
he
was
years
old
and
seemed
even
older
he
was
however
younger
than
doña
victorina
who
was
only
he
had
come
to
the
philippines
in
the
capacity
of
clerk
in
the
custom
house
but
after
all
the
of
the
voyage
and
after
fracturing
a
leg
on
the
way
he
had
the
bad
luck
to
receive
his
discharge
fifteen
days
after
his
arrival
he
was
left
without
a
single
cuarto
distrusting
the
sea
he
did
not
wish
to
return
to
spain
without
having
made
a
fortune
so
he
decided
to
devote
himself
to
something
spanish
pride
did
not
permit
him
to
do
any
manual
labor
the
poor
man
would
have
worked
with
pleasure
to
have
earned
an
honorable
living
but
the
prestige
of
the
spaniard
did
not
permit
this
nor
did
that
prestige
provide
him
with
the
necessities
of
life
at
first
he
lived
at
the
expense
of
some
of
his
countrymen
but
as
tiburcio
had
some
the
bread
was
sour
to
him
and
instead
of
getting
fat
he
grew
thin
as
he
had
neither
knowledge
of
any
science
money
nor
recommendations
his
countrymen
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him
advised
him
to
go
to
some
of
the
provinces
and
pass
himself
off
as
a
doctor
of
medicine
at
first
he
did
not
like
the
idea
and
opposed
the
plan
for
although
he
had
been
a
servant
in
the
san
carlos
hospital
he
had
not
learned
anything
about
the
science
of
healing
his
duty
having
been
to
dust
off
the
benches
and
light
the
fires
and
even
in
this
work
he
had
served
only
a
short
time
but
as
necessity
was
pressing
him
hard
and
as
his
friends
pointed
out
the
vanity
of
his
scruples
he
took
their
advice
went
into
the
provinces
and
began
to
visit
the
sick
charging
as
much
for
his
services
as
his
conscience
permitted
later
on
he
began
to
charge
dearly
and
to
put
a
high
price
on
his
visits
on
this
account
he
was
at
once
taken
to
be
a
great
doctor
and
would
probably
have
made
his
fortune
had
not
the
attention
of
the
protective
medical
society
of
manila
been
called
to
his
exorbitant
charges
and
to
his
harmful
competition
private
citizens
and
professors
interceded
in
his
behalf
man
said
the
zealous
doctor
in
speaking
of
him
let
him
make
his
little
money
let
him
make
his
little
six
or
seven
thousand
pesos
he
will
be
able
to
return
to
his
native
land
then
and
live
in
peace
what
does
it
matter
to
you
let
him
deceive
the
unwary
natives
then
they
may
become
smarter
he
is
a
poor
unhappy
fellow
do
not
take
the
bread
from
his
mouth
be
a
good
spaniard
doctor
was
a
good
spaniard
and
he
winked
at
the
matter
but
when
the
facts
reached
the
ears
of
the
people
they
began
to
lose
confidence
in
him
and
little
by
little
don
tiburcio
espadaña
lost
his
clientage
and
found
himself
almost
obliged
to
beg
for
bread
day
by
day
then
it
was
that
he
learned
from
a
friend
of
his
who
was
also
a
friend
of
doña
victorina
about
the
position
of
that
woman
and
about
her
patriotism
and
good
heart
don
tiburcio
saw
in
her
a
bit
of
blue
sky
and
asked
to
be
presented
doña
victorina
and
don
tiburcio
met
tarde
venientibus
ossa
he
would
have
exclaimed
if
he
had
known
latin
she
was
no
longer
passable
she
was
past
her
abundant
hair
had
been
reduced
to
a
wad
about
the
size
of
an
onion
top
as
the
servants
were
wont
to
describe
it
her
face
was
full
of
wrinkles
and
her
teeth
had
begun
to
loosen
her
eyes
had
also
suffered
and
considerably
too
she
had
to
squint
frequently
when
she
cared
to
look
off
at
a
certain
distance
her
character
was
the
only
thing
that
had
remained
unchanged
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
conversation
they
came
to
an
understanding
and
accepted
each
other
she
would
have
preferred
a
spaniard
less
lame
less
of
a
stammerer
less
bald
one
with
more
teeth
one
of
more
rank
and
social
standing
or
categoría
as
she
called
it
but
this
class
of
spaniards
never
came
to
ask
her
hand
she
had
heard
too
more
than
once
that
opportunity
is
bald
and
she
honestly
believed
that
don
tiburcio
was
that
very
opportunity
for
on
account
of
his
dark
days
he
had
prematurely
lost
his
hair
what
woman
is
not
prudent
at
don
tiburcio
for
his
part
felt
a
vague
melancholy
when
he
thought
of
his
honeymoon
he
smiled
with
resignation
especially
when
he
called
the
phantom
of
hunger
to
his
aid
he
had
never
had
ambition
or
pretensions
his
tastes
were
simple
his
thoughts
limited
but
his
heart
untouched
till
then
had
dreamed
of
a
very
different
divinity
in
his
youth
when
tired
by
his
day
labor
after
a
frugal
meal
he
lay
down
on
a
poor
bed
he
dreamed
of
a
smiling
affectionate
image
afterward
when
his
sorrows
and
privations
increased
the
years
passed
and
his
poetical
dreams
were
not
fulfilled
he
thought
merely
of
a
good
woman
a
willing
hand
a
worker
who
might
afford
him
a
small
dowry
console
him
when
tired
from
labor
and
quarrel
with
him
from
time
to
time
yes
he
was
thinking
of
the
quarrels
as
a
happiness
but
when
obliged
to
wander
from
country
to
country
in
search
no
longer
of
a
fortune
but
of
some
commodity
to
sustain
his
life
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
when
deluded
by
the
accounts
of
his
countrymen
who
came
from
beyond
the
seas
he
embarked
for
the
philippines
then
the
vision
of
a
housekeeper
gave
way
to
an
image
of
an
arrogant
mestiza
a
beautiful
native
with
large
black
eyes
draped
in
silks
and
transparent
garments
loaded
with
diamonds
and
gold
offering
him
her
love
and
her
carriages
he
arrived
in
the
philippines
and
believed
that
he
was
about
to
realize
his
dream
for
the
young
women
who
in
carriages
frequented
the
luneta
and
the
malecon
manila
popular
and
fashionable
drives
looked
at
him
with
a
certain
curiosity
later
when
this
curiosity
on
their
part
had
ceased
the
mestiza
disappeared
from
his
dreams
and
with
great
labor
he
formed
in
his
mind
a
picture
of
a
widow
but
an
agreeable
widow
so
it
was
that
when
he
saw
only
part
of
his
dream
taking
on
real
form
he
became
sad
but
he
was
somewhat
of
a
philosopher
and
said
to
himself
that
was
a
dream
but
in
the
world
one
does
not
live
in
dreams
thus
he
settled
all
his
doubts
she
wasted
a
lot
of
rice
powder
on
her
cheeks
pshaw
when
they
were
once
married
he
would
make
her
stop
that
easily
enough
she
had
many
wrinkles
in
her
face
but
his
coat
had
more
bare
spots
and
patches
she
was
old
pretentious
and
imperious
but
hunger
was
more
imperious
and
still
more
pretentious
and
then
too
he
had
a
sweet
disposition
and
who
could
tell
love
modifies
character
she
spoke
spanish
very
badly
but
he
himself
did
not
speak
it
well
at
least
the
head
of
the
customs
department
had
so
notified
him
in
his
discharge
from
his
position
and
besides
what
did
it
matter
what
if
she
was
old
and
ridiculous
he
was
lame
toothless
and
bald
when
some
friend
jested
with
him
he
would
respond
give
me
bread
and
call
me
a
fool
don
tiburcio
was
what
is
vulgarly
called
a
man
who
would
not
harm
a
fly
he
was
modest
and
incapable
of
conceiving
an
evil
thought
he
would
have
made
a
good
missionary
had
he
lived
in
olden
times
his
stay
in
the
country
had
not
given
him
that
conviction
of
his
own
superiority
of
his
own
worth
and
of
his
high
importance
which
the
larger
part
of
his
countrymen
acquire
in
a
few
weeks
in
the
philippines
his
heart
had
never
been
able
to
conceive
hatred
for
anybody
or
anything
he
had
not
yet
been
able
to
find
a
revolutionist
he
only
looked
upon
the
people
as
unhappy
beings
whom
it
was
fitting
for
him
to
deprive
of
a
little
of
their
wealth
in
order
to
prevent
himself
becoming
even
more
unhappy
than
they
when
they
tried
to
make
a
case
against
him
for
passing
as
a
doctor
without
a
proper
license
he
did
not
resent
it
he
did
not
complain
he
saw
the
justice
of
the
case
and
only
replied
but
it
is
necessary
to
live
so
they
were
married
and
went
to
santa
aña
to
pass
their
honeymoon
but
on
the
night
of
the
wedding
doña
victorina
had
a
bad
attack
of
indigestion
don
tiburcio
gave
thanks
to
god
and
showed
solicitude
and
care
on
the
second
night
however
he
conducted
himself
like
an
honorable
man
but
on
the
day
following
when
he
looked
in
the
mirror
at
his
bare
gums
he
smiled
with
melancholy
he
had
grown
ten
years
older
at
least
doña
victorina
charmed
with
her
husband
had
a
good
set
of
front
teeth
made
for
him
and
had
the
best
tailors
in
the
city
dress
and
equip
him
she
ordered
carriages
and
calesas
sent
to
batangas
and
albay
provinces
for
the
finest
spans
of
horses
and
even
obliged
him
to
make
two
entries
in
the
coming
horse
races
in
the
meantime
while
she
was
transforming
her
husband
she
did
not
forget
her
own
person
she
laid
aside
the
silk
saya
or
filipino
skirt
and
piña
cloth
bodice
for
a
dress
of
european
style
she
substituted
false
curls
in
front
for
the
simple
hair
dress
of
the
filipinos
her
dresses
which
fitted
her
divinely
bad
disturbed
the
peace
and
tranquillity
of
the
entire
neighborhood
the
husband
never
went
out
of
the
house
afoot
she
did
not
want
people
to
see
that
he
was
lame
he
always
took
her
for
drives
through
the
places
most
deserted
much
to
her
pain
for
she
wanted
to
display
her
husband
on
the
drives
most
frequented
by
the
public
but
out
of
respect
for
their
honeymoon
she
kept
silent
the
last
quarter
of
the
honeymoon
had
just
begun
when
he
wanted
to
stop
her
from
using
rice
powder
on
her
cheeks
saying
to
her
that
it
was
false
and
not
natural
doña
victorina
frowned
and
looked
squarely
at
his
front
set
of
teeth
he
at
once
became
silent
and
she
learned
his
weakness
she
soon
got
the
idea
that
she
was
to
become
a
mother
and
made
the
following
announcement
to
all
her
friends
next
month
we
i
and
de
espadaña
are
going
to
the
peñinsula
i
do
want
to
have
my
son
born
here
and
have
them
call
him
a
revolutionist
she
added
a
de
to
her
husband
name
the
de
did
not
cost
anything
and
gave
categoría
to
the
name
when
she
signed
herself
she
wrote
victorina
de
los
reyes
de
de
espadaña
that
de
de
espadaña
was
her
mania
neither
the
lithographer
who
printed
her
cards
nor
her
husband
could
get
the
idea
out
of
her
head
if
i
do
not
put
more
than
one
de
in
the
name
people
will
think
that
i
have
it
fool
said
she
to
her
husband
she
was
talking
continually
about
her
preparations
for
the
voyage
to
spain
she
learned
by
memory
the
names
of
the
points
where
the
steamers
called
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
hear
her
talk
i
am
going
to
see
the
sismus
of
the
suez
canal
de
espadaña
thinks
that
it
is
the
most
beautiful
and
de
espadaña
has
seen
the
whole
world
i
will
probably
never
return
to
this
land
of
savages
i
was
not
born
to
live
here
aden
or
port
said
would
be
more
suitable
for
me
i
have
always
thought
so
since
i
was
a
child
doña
victorina
in
her
geography
divided
the
world
into
two
parts
the
philippines
and
spain
in
this
she
differed
from
the
lower
class
of
people
in
madrid
for
they
divide
it
into
spain
and
america
or
spain
and
china
america
and
china
being
merely
different
names
for
the
same
country
the
husband
knew
that
some
of
these
things
were
barbarisms
but
he
kept
silent
so
that
she
would
not
mock
him
and
twit
him
with
his
stammering
she
feigned
to
be
whimsical
in
order
to
increase
her
illusion
that
she
was
a
mother
and
she
began
to
dress
herself
in
colors
adorn
herself
with
flowers
and
ribbons
and
to
walk
through
the
escolta
in
a
wrapper
but
oh
what
an
illusion
three
months
passed
and
the
dream
vanished
by
this
time
having
no
fear
that
her
son
would
be
a
revolutionist
she
gave
up
the
voyage
she
consulted
doctors
and
old
women
but
all
in
vain
to
the
great
displeasure
of
captain
tiago
she
made
fun
of
san
pascual
bailon
as
she
did
not
care
to
run
to
any
saint
on
account
of
this
a
friend
of
her
husband
told
her
believe
me
señora
you
are
the
only
espiritu
fuerte
person
in
this
country
she
smiled
without
understanding
what
espiritu
fuerte
meant
but
at
night
when
it
was
time
to
be
sleeping
she
asked
her
husband
about
it
daughter
replied
he
the
e
espir
espiritu
most
that
i
know
know
about
is
a
a
ammonia
my
must
have
a
figure
of
rhetoric
from
that
time
on
she
was
always
saying
whenever
she
could
i
am
the
only
ammonia
in
this
country
speaking
rhetorically
as
señor
de
who
is
from
the
peñinsula
and
who
has
much
categoría
puts
it
whatever
she
said
had
to
be
done
she
had
come
to
dominate
her
husband
completely
on
his
part
he
offered
no
great
resistance
and
was
converted
into
a
little
lap
dog
for
her
if
he
incommoded
her
she
would
not
let
him
go
out
for
a
drive
and
when
she
became
really
infuriated
she
would
snatch
out
his
false
teeth
and
leave
him
a
man
for
one
or
more
days
according
to
the
offense
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
husband
ought
to
be
a
doctor
of
medicine
and
surgery
and
so
she
expressed
herself
to
him
daughter
do
you
want
them
to
arrest
me
he
said
frightened
do
be
a
fool
let
me
arrange
it
she
replied
you
are
not
going
to
attend
any
one
but
i
want
them
to
call
you
a
doctor
and
me
a
doctora
eh
and
on
the
following
day
rodoreda
a
prominent
marble
dealer
in
manila
received
an
order
for
the
following
engraving
on
black
marble
de
espadaña
specialist
in
all
kinds
of
diseases
all
of
the
servants
had
to
give
them
their
new
titles
and
in
consequence
of
it
all
she
increased
the
number
of
her
curls
in
front
the
layer
of
rice
powder
the
ribbons
and
laces
and
looked
with
more
disdain
than
ever
on
the
poor
and
less
fortunate
women
of
her
country
who
had
less
categoría
than
she
each
day
she
felt
herself
more
dignified
and
elevated
and
following
along
this
road
in
less
than
a
year
she
would
think
herself
of
divine
origin
these
sublime
thoughts
however
did
not
prevent
her
from
growing
more
ridiculous
and
older
each
day
every
time
that
captain
tiago
met
her
in
the
street
and
remembered
that
he
had
once
made
love
to
her
in
vain
he
would
go
at
once
to
the
church
and
give
a
peso
for
a
mass
as
a
thank
offering
for
his
good
luck
in
not
marrying
her
in
spite
of
this
captain
tiago
highly
respected
her
husband
on
account
of
his
title
of
specialist
in
all
kinds
of
diseases
and
he
listened
with
close
attention
to
the
few
phrases
that
he
managed
to
stutter
out
in
fact
it
was
on
account
of
this
title
and
the
fact
that
the
doctor
did
not
attend
everybody
that
the
captain
chose
him
to
attend
his
daughter
as
to
the
young
man
linares
it
is
a
different
story
when
she
was
making
ready
for
her
voyage
to
spain
doña
victorina
thought
of
having
an
administrator
from
the
peñinsula
to
look
after
her
affairs
for
she
did
not
trust
filipinos
her
husband
remembered
a
nephew
in
madrid
who
was
studying
to
become
a
lawyer
and
who
was
considered
the
smartest
one
in
his
family
they
wrote
to
him
then
sending
him
in
advance
money
for
the
passage
and
when
the
dream
was
dispelled
the
young
man
was
already
on
his
way
these
are
the
three
persons
who
had
just
arrived
while
they
were
eating
their
breakfast
father
salví
arrived
and
as
the
husband
and
wife
had
already
met
the
friar
they
presented
him
to
the
young
linares
with
all
his
titles
the
young
man
blushed
as
was
natural
they
spoke
of
maria
clara
the
young
maiden
was
resting
and
sleeping
they
talked
over
the
voyage
doña
victorina
showed
her
verbosity
by
criticising
the
customs
of
the
provinces
the
nipa
houses
the
bamboo
bridges
without
forgetting
to
tell
the
curate
about
her
friendship
with
the
commander
of
the
army
the
alcalde
so
and
so
judge
so
and
so
of
the
supreme
court
and
with
the
governor
of
the
province
all
persons
of
categoría
who
had
much
consideration
for
her
if
you
had
come
two
days
before
dona
victorina
replied
captain
tiago
during
a
short
pause
you
would
have
met
his
excellency
the
governor
general
he
sat
right
there
what
how
that
was
his
excellency
here
and
in
your
house
a
lie
i
tell
you
he
sat
right
there
if
you
had
come
two
days
before
ah
what
a
shame
that
little
clara
did
not
fall
sick
before
exclaimed
she
in
real
sorrow
and
directing
herself
to
linares
do
you
hear
cousin
his
excellency
was
here
you
see
de
espadaña
was
right
when
he
told
you
that
we
were
not
going
to
the
house
of
a
miserable
native
for
you
should
know
don
santiago
that
our
cousin
was
a
friend
of
all
the
ministers
in
madrid
and
all
the
dukes
and
he
dined
in
the
house
of
count
del
campanario
belfry
duke
de
la
torre
tower
victorina
said
her
husband
correcting
her
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing
do
you
think
you
can
tell
me
that
would
i
find
father
dámaso
in
town
interrupted
linares
turning
to
father
salví
they
have
told
me
that
he
is
near
here
he
is
precisely
and
will
come
here
in
a
little
while
replied
the
curate
how
glad
i
am
i
have
a
letter
for
him
exclaimed
the
young
man
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
happy
chance
which
brought
me
here
i
would
have
come
expressly
to
visit
him
the
happy
chance
that
is
maria
clara
had
in
the
meantime
awakened
de
espadaña
said
doña
victorina
finishing
her
breakfast
are
we
going
to
see
little
clara
and
turning
to
captain
tiago
for
you
only
don
santiago
for
you
alone
my
husband
does
not
treat
anybody
except
people
of
categoría
and
he
even
refuses
some
of
them
my
husband
is
not
like
those
about
here
in
madrid
he
only
visited
people
of
categoría
they
passed
into
the
sick
room
the
room
was
almost
dark
the
windows
were
shut
for
fear
of
a
draught
and
the
little
light
which
illuminated
the
room
came
from
the
two
wax
candles
which
were
burning
in
front
of
an
image
of
the
virgin
of
antipolo
her
head
wrapped
up
in
a
handkerchief
saturated
in
cologne
water
her
body
wrapped
in
wide
folds
of
white
sheets
which
outlined
her
virginal
form
the
sick
maiden
lay
on
her
bed
of
kamakon
among
jusi
and
piña
curtains
her
hair
forming
a
frame
around
her
oval
face
increased
her
transparent
paleness
which
was
animated
only
by
her
large
eyes
full
of
sadness
at
her
side
were
her
two
friends
and
andeng
de
espadaña
felt
of
her
pulse
examined
her
tongue
asked
some
questions
and
shaking
his
head
seriously
said
is
but
can

doña
victorina
looked
with
pride
at
those
around
her
a
in
in
morning

ordered
de

little

said
doña
victorina
approaching
her
we
have
come
to
cure
you
i
am
going
to
present
our
cousin
to
you
linares
was
absorbed
contemplating
those
eloquent
eyes
which
seemed
to
be
seeking
some
one
and
he
did
not
hear
doña
victorina
call
him
señor
linares
said
the
curate
calling
him
out
of
his
ecstacy
here
comes
father
dámaso
in
fact
father
dámaso
was
coming
pale
and
somewhat
sad
on
leaving
his
bed
his
first
visit
was
to
maria
clara
he
was
no
longer
the
father
dámaso
that
he
had
been
so
robust
and
talkative
he
now
walked
along
in
silence
and
with
unsteady
footsteps
chapter

schemes
without
paying
attention
to
anybody
father
dámaso
went
straight
to
the
sick
room
and
took
hold
of
maria
hand
maria
said
he
with
indescribable
tenderness
as
tears
dropped
from
his
eyes
maria
my
child
you
are
not
going
to
die
maria
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
with
surprise
none
who
knew
the
franciscan
suspected
that
he
ever
had
such
tender
thoughts
no
one
ever
supposed
that
a
heart
existed
under
that
gross
and
rude
aspect
father
dámaso
could
say
no
more
and
left
the
maiden
weeping
like
a
child
he
went
out
through
the
room
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
to
give
free
vent
to
his
grief
on
maria
clara
balcony
under
her
favorite
vines
how
he
loves
his
thought
they
all
father
salví
witnessed
the
scene
immovable
and
silent
lightly
biting
his
lips
when
his
grief
was
somewhat
soothed
father
dámaso
was
introduced
by
doña
victorina
to
the
young
linares
who
approached
the
friar
with
respect
father
dámaso
gazed
at
him
in
silence
from
head
to
foot
he
took
the
letter
which
the
young
man
handed
to
him
and
read
it
apparently
without
understanding
it
for
he
asked
him
and
who
are
you
alfonso
linares
the
of
your
stammered
the
young
man
father
dámaso
leaned
back
and
examined
the
young
man
again
his
face
brightened
up
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
so
you
are
the
of
little
charles
he
exclaimed
come
here
and
let
me
embrace
you
it
was
some
days
ago
that
i
received
your
letter
so
it
is

did
not
know
you
but
that
is
easily
explained
for
you
were
not
yet
born
when
i
left
the
country
i
never
knew
you
and
father
dámaso
stretched
out
his
robust
arms
to
the
young
man
who
blushed
either
from
shame
or
suffocation
father
dámaso
seemed
to
have
completely
forgotten
his
grief
after
the
first
moments
of
effusion
had
passed
and
questions
had
been
asked
about
carlicos
as
he
called
little
charles
father
dámaso
asked
well
what
does
carlicos
want
me
to
do
for
you
i
believe
he
says
something
in
the
letter
stammered
linares
again
in
the
letter
let
us
see
is
so
and
he
wants
me
to
get
you
a
job
and
a
wife
hm

is
easy
do

hm
hm
a
wife
father
i
am
not
in
a
hurry
about
it
said
linares
confused
but
father
dámaso
began
to
walk
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
muttering
a
wife
a
wife
his
face
by
this
time
was
no
longer
sad
nor
was
it
cheerful
it
expressed
the
greatest
seriousness
and
he
seemed
to
be
meditating
father
salví
surveyed
the
scene
from
a
distance
i
did
not
believe
that
it
could
give
me
such
pain
murmured
father
dámaso
in
a
mournful
voice
but
of
two
evils
the
lesser
and
raising
his
voice
and
approaching
linares
he
said
come
here
my
boy
we
will
speak
with
santiago
linares
turned
pale
and
allowed
himself
to
be
led
along
by
the
priest
who
was
deep
in
thought
then
it
was
father
salví
turn
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
and
he
did
so
meditating
as
was
his
custom
a
voice
bidding
him
good
morning
stopped
his
monotonous
tread
he
raised
his
head
and
his
eyes
met
lucas
who
saluted
him
humbly
what
do
you
want
asked
the
eyes
of
the
curate
father
i
am
the
brother
of
the
man
who
was
killed
on
the
day
of
the
fiesta
replied
lucas
in
a
tearful
tone
father
salví
stepped
back
and
what
of
it
he
muttered
in
an
unintelligible
voice
lucas
made
an
effort
to
weep
and
dried
his
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
father
said
he
crying
i
have
been
to
crisostomo
house
to
ask
him
for
indemnity
at
first
he
received
me
with
kicks
saying
that
he
would
not
pay
anything
since
he
had
run
the
risk
of
being
killed
through
the
fault
of
my
dear
unfortunate
brother
yesterday
i
went
to
talk
with
him
again
but
he
had
already
left
for
manila
leaving
me
for
charity
sake
five
hundred
pesos
for
my
poor
brother
five
hundred
pesos
ah
father
the
curate
listened
to
the
first
part
of
his
story
with
surprise
and
attention
but
slowly
there
appeared
on
his
lips
a
smile
a
smile
of
such
contempt
and
sarcasm
at
the
comedy
that
was
being
played
that
if
lucas
had
seen
it
he
would
have
fled
in
all
haste
and
what
do
you
want
now
he
asked
turning
his
back
to
him
alas
father
for
love
of
god
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
do
father
you
have
always
given
good
advice
who
has
told
you
that
you
do
not
live
here
but
the
whole
province
knows
you
father
father
salví
went
up
to
him
with
his
eyes
full
of
anger
and
motioning
to
the
street
said
to
the
frightened
lucas
go
to
your
house
and
give
thanks
to
don
crisostomo
that
he
has
not
sent
you
to
jail
get
away
from
here
forgetting
his
rôle
lucas
muttered
well
i
thought
out
of
here
cried
father
salví
in
a
nervous
tone
i
want
to
see
father
dámaso
father
dámaso
is
busy
out
of
here
ordered
the
curate
in
an
imperative
tone
again
lucas
went
down
the
stairs
murmuring
he
is
another
how
poorly
he
pays
he
who
pays
better
the
voice
of
the
curate
had
reached
the
ears
of
all
in
the
house
even
father
dámaso
captain
tiago
and
linares
an
insolent
beggar
who
came
to
ask
alms
and
does
want
to
work
said
father
salví
taking
his
hat
and
cane
and
starting
toward
the
convent
chapter
xxvi
the
persecuted
by
the
dim
light
which
the
moon
diffused
through
the
thick
branches
of
the
trees
a
man
wandered
along
the
forest
trails
slowly
and
cautiously
from
time
to
time
as
if
to
find
out
where
he
was
he
whistled
a
particular
melody
to
which
another
in
the
distance
responded
with
the
same
air
the
man
listened
attentively
and
afterward
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
the
distant
sound
finally
passing
through
the
thousand
difficulties
which
a
virgin
forest
offers
in
the
night
time
he
came
to
a
small
clearing
high
rocks
crowned
with
trees
surrounded
the
place
forming
a
sort
of
ruined
amphitheatre
recently
cut
trees
with
their
charred
trunks
and
enormous
rocks
which
nature
had
covered
with
her
mantle
of
green
foliage
filled
the
middle
of
the
open
space
scarcely
had
the
unknown
man
arrived
when
another
figure
quickly
appeared
from
behind
one
of
the
large
rocks
advanced
and
drew
a
revolver
who
are
you
he
asked
in
tagalog
and
in
an
imperious
voice
as
he
cocked
the
hammer
of
his
weapon
is
old
pablo
among
you
asked
the
first
calmly
without
replying
to
the
question
or
becoming
intimidated
do
you
refer
to
the
captain
yes
he
is
tell
him
then
that
elias
is
looking
for
him
here
said
the
man
are
you
elias
asked
the
other
with
a
certain
respect
and
approaching
him
without
lowering
his
revolver
then
come
elias
followed
him
they
penetrated
into
a
kind
of
cavern
which
was
hollowed
out
in
the
depths
of
the
earth
the
guide
who
knew
the
way
told
the
pilot
when
he
ought
to
get
down
stoop
or
crawl
however
it
was
not
long
before
they
came
to
a
sala
or
room
in
the
cave
miserably
illuminated
by
pitch
torches
and
occupied
by
twelve
or
fifteen
armed
men
the
faces
of
the
men
were
dirty
and
their
clothes
ragged
some
were
sitting
down
others
lying
down
conversing
among
themselves
in
a
low
tone
leaning
his
elbows
on
a
stone
which
served
as
a
table
and
contemplating
thoughtfully
the
lamp
which
was
shedding
very
little
light
for
the
amount
of
smoke
it
made
sat
an
old
man
his
countenance
was
sad
and
his
head
wrapped
in
a
bloody
rag
if
we
had
not
known
that
the
place
was
a
cave
of
tulisanes
we
would
have
said
on
reading
the
desperation
on
the
face
of
the
old
man
that
it
was
the
tower
of
hunger
on
the
eve
when
ugolino
devoured
his
sons
at
the
arrival
of
elias
and
the
guide
the
men
were
about
to
arise
but
at
a
signal
from
the
guide
they
were
quieted
and
contented
themselves
with
examining
the
pilot
who
was
entirely
unarmed
the
old
man
turned
his
head
slowly
and
his
eyes
met
the
sturdy
figure
of
elias
the
latter
in
turn
with
his
head
uncovered
full
of
sadness
and
interest
gazed
upon
the
old
man
is
it
you
asked
the
old
man
his
face
brightening
a
little
as
he
recognized
the
youth
how
badly
off
you
are
murmured
elias
in
an
tone
of
voice
the
old
man
bowed
in
silence
made
a
sign
to
the
men
who
then
arose
and
left
not
however
without
first
directing
glances
at
the
pilot
measuring
his
stature
and
muscles
yes
said
the
old
man
to
elias
as
soon
as
they
found
themselves
alone
six
months
ago
i
gave
you
refuge
in
my
house
then
it
was
i
who
sympathized
with
you
now
fortune
has
changed
and
it
is
you
who
pity
me
but
sit
down
and
tell
me
how
you
came
here
some
fifteen
days
ago
they
told
me
of
your
misfortune
replied
the
young
man
slowly
and
in
a
low
voice
looking
toward
the
light
i
at
once
set
out
on
the
road
and
i
have
been
searching
for
you
from
mountain
to
mountain
i
have
travelled
over
the
greater
part
of
two
provinces
rather
than
spill
innocent
blood
said
pablo
i
have
had
to
flee
my
enemies
are
afraid
to
show
themselves
and
shield
themselves
behind
some
unhappy
fellows
who
have
never
done
me
the
slightest
injury
then
after
a
short
pause
of
which
elias
took
advantage
to
read
the
thoughts
in
that
melancholy
countenance
he
replied
i
have
come
to
make
a
proposition
having
searched
in
vain
for
some
member
of
the
family
which
has
caused
me
my
misfortunes
i
have
decided
to
leave
the
province
where
i
am
living
and
to
emigrate
to
the
north
and
live
there
among
the
heathen
and
independent
tribes
do
you
want
to
leave
this
life
and
go
with
me
i
will
be
your
son
since
you
have
lost
those
whom
you
had
and
i
who
have
no
family
will
take
you
as
my
father
the
old
man
shook
his
head
and
said
at
my
age
when
a
person
makes
a
desperate
resolution
it
is
because
there
is
no
other
course
open
a
man
who
like
me
has
passed
his
youth
and
the
best
years
of
his
life
working
for
his
own
future
and
for
the
future
of
his
sons
a
man
who
has
been
submissive
to
all
the
wishes
of
his
superiors
who
has
discharged
conscientiously
all
his
duties
suffered
everything
in
order
to
live
in
peace
and
in
tranquillity
when
such
a
man
whose
blood
has
been
chilled
by
time
renounces
all
his
past
and
all
his
future
on
the
very
edge
of
his
grave
when
a
man
does
this
it
is
because
he
has
decided
with
mature
judgment
that
peace
does
not
exist
and
that
there
is
no
supreme
good
what
use
is
there
in
living
a
few
miserable
days
in
a
foreign
land
i
had
two
sons
a
daughter
a
fireside
a
fortune
i
enjoyed
consideration
and
esteem
now
i
am
like
a
tree
that
has
been
stripped
of
its
branches
a
wandering
fugitive
hunted
like
a
wild
beast
in
the
forest
and
all
why
because
a
man
dishonored
my
daughter
because
her
brothers
wanted
to
make
that
man
account
for
his
infamous
deed
and
because
that
man
is
placed
above
all
others
with
a
title
of
minister
of
god
but
despite
it
all
i
a
father
i
dishonored
in
my
old
age
pardoned
the
injury
for
i
was
indulgent
with
the
passions
of
youth
and
the
weakness
of
the
flesh
and
as
the
evil
was
irreparable
i
wanted
to
save
what
still
remained
to
me
but
the
criminal
afraid
that
vengeance
was
near
at
hand
sought
the
destruction
of
my
sons
what
did
he
do
you
do
not
know
do
you
know
how
they
feigned
that
there
had
been
a
robbery
in
the
convent
and
how
one
of
my
sons
figured
among
the
accused
the
other
son
they
could
not
include
because
he
was
away
do
you
know
the
tortures
to
which
they
were
submitted
you
know
them
because
they
are
like
those
in
other
towns
i
saw
my
son
hung
by
the
hair
i
heard
his
cries
i
heard
him
call
me
and
coward
that
i
was
and
accustomed
to
peace
i
was
not
brave
enough
to
kill
or
be
killed
do
you
know
that
the
robbery
was
not
proved
that
it
was
seen
that
it
was
a
calumny
that
the
curate
was
transferred
to
another
town
and
that
my
son
died
from
the
result
of
his
tortures
the
other
boy
who
was
still
left
for
me
was
not
a
coward
like
his
father
the
executioner
was
afraid
that
this
son
would
take
revenge
for
the
death
of
his
brother
and
so
under
pretense
of
his
not
having
a
cedula
which
for
the
moment
had
been
forgotten
he
was
imprisoned
by
the
civil
guard
maltreated
irritated
and
provoked
by
force
and
injuries
until
he
was
driven
to
suicide
and
i
have
survived
after
such
a
disgrace
but
if
i
had
not
the
courage
of
a
father
to
defend
his
sons
i
have
left
a
heart
to
take
vengeance
and
i
shall
be
revenged
the
discontented
are
uniting
under
my
command
my
enemies
increase
my
camp
and
on
that
day
when
i
consider
myself
strong
enough
i
will
go
down
into
the
plain
and
extinguish
in
fire
both
my
vengeance
and
my
own
existence
and
that
day
will
come
or
there
is
no
god
the
old
man
rose
to
his
feet
deeply
agitated
with
his
eyes
sparkling
like
fire
and
in
a
hollow
voice
he
added
tearing
his
long
hair
curses
upon
me
curses
upon
me
for
having
restrained
the
avenging
hand
of
my
sons
i
have
assassinated
them
had
i
allowed
them
to
kill
the
criminal
had
i
had
less
faith
in
the
justice
of
god
and
of
men
i
would
now
have
my
sons
perhaps
they
would
have
been
fugitives
but
i
would
have
them
and
they
would
not
have
died
in
torture
i
was
not
born
to
be
a
father
for
that
reason
i
have
them
with
me
now
curses
upon
me
for
not
having
learned
with
all
my
years
in
what
age
we
live
but
in
blood
and
fire
and
in
my
own
death
i
will
know
how
to
take
vengeance
for
them
the
unfortunate
father
in
the
paroxysm
of
his
grief
had
taken
off
the
bandage
from
his
head
opening
up
a
wound
which
he
had
on
the
forehead
and
from
which
the
blood
oozed
out
i
respect
your
grief
replied
elias
and
i
understand
your
desire
for
vengeance
i
too
am
like
you
but
for
fear
of
harming
an
innocent
one
i
prefer
to
forget
my
misfortunes
you
can
forget
them
because
you
are
young
and
because
you
have
not
lost
your
son
have
not
lost
your
last
hope
but
i
assure
you
i
will
not
harm
an
innocent
person
do
you
see
that
wound
i
allowed
myself
to
receive
that
in
order
not
to
kill
a
poor
cuaderillero
who
was
fulfilling
his
duty
but
see
said
elias
after
a
moment
silence
see
what
frightful
destruction
you
will
bring
upon
our
unfortunate
country
if
you
seek
revenge
by
your
own
hand
your
enemies
will
retaliate
not
against
you
not
against
those
who
are
armed
but
against
the
people
who
are
always
accused
and
then
how
many
more
injustices
let
the
people
learn
to
defend
themselves
let
each
learn
to
defend
himself
you
know
that
that
is
impossible
señor
i
have
known
you
in
other
times
when
you
were
happy
then
you
gave
me
wise
advice
will
you
permit
me
the
old
man
crossed
his
arms
and
seemed
to
meditate
upon
what
he
was
going
to
say
señor
continued
elias
measuring
his
words
well
i
have
had
the
fortune
to
be
of
service
to
a
young
man
rich
of
good
heart
noble
and
a
lover
of
his
country
welfare
they
say
that
this
young
man
has
friends
in
madrid
i
do
not
know
it
but
i
can
positively
assure
you
that
he
is
a
friend
of
the
governor
general
what
do
you
say
if
we
make
him
the
bearer
of
the
people
complaints
if
we
can
interest
him
in
the
cause
of
the
unhappy
the
old
man
shook
his
head
do
you
say
that
he
is
a
rich
man
the
rich
think
of
nothing
but
to
increase
their
riches
pride
and
pomp
blind
them
and
since
they
are
generally
well
off
especially
if
they
have
powerful
friends
none
of
them
ever
troubles
himself
about
the
unfortunates
i
know
it
all
for
i
was
once
rich
myself
but
the
man
of
whom
i
am
speaking
does
not
seem
to
be
like
the
others
he
is
a
son
who
would
not
allow
the
memory
of
his
father
to
be
dishonored
he
is
a
young
man
who
thinks
about
the
future
thinks
of
a
good
future
for
his
sons
for
he
may
in
a
short
time
have
a
family
of
his
own
then
he
is
a
man
who
is
going
to
be
happy
our
cause
is
not
a
cause
for
happy
men
but
it
is
a
cause
for
men
of
good
hearts
that
may
be
replied
the
old
man
sitting
down
suppose
that
he
consented
to
carry
our
complaints
to
the
governor
general
suppose
that
he
finds
in
the
court
those
who
will
argue
for
us
do
you
think
we
will
get
justice
let
us
try
it
before
resorting
to
bloody
measures
replied
elias
it
must
seem
strange
to
you
that
i
another
unfortunate
young
robust
that
i
should
propose
to
you
old
and
weak
peaceful
measures
but
it
is
because
i
have
seen
so
many
miseries
caused
by
us
similar
to
those
caused
by
tyrants
the
unarmed
is
the
one
who
suffers
and
if
we
do
not
accomplish
anything
something
will
be
accomplished
believe
me
not
all
who
govern
are
unjust
and
if
we
do
not
accomplish
anything
if
our
voice
is
not
listened
to
if
the
man
turns
a
deaf
ear
to
the
grief
of
his
fellow
men
then
we
will
put
ourselves
under
your
orders
the
old
man
full
of
enthusiasm
embraced
the
young
man
i
accept
your
proposition
elias
i
know
that
you
will
keep
your
word
you
come
to
me
and
i
will
help
you
take
vengeance
for
your
father
you
will
help
me
to
take
vengeance
for
my
sons
my
sons
who
were
like
you
in
the
meantime
señor
avoid
all
violent
measures
you
can
expound
the
complaints
of
the
people
you
certainly
know
them
when
will
we
know
the
answer
within
four
days
send
a
man
to
meet
me
on
the
beach
at
san
diego
and
i
will
tell
him
what
the
person
in
whom
i
have
hope
says
if
he
accepts
we
will
get
justice
and
if
he
does
not
accept
i
will
be
the
first
to
fall
in
the
fight
which
we
will
begin
elias
will
not
die
elias
will
be
chief
when
captain
pablo
falls
satisfied
in
his
revenge
said

old

chapter
xxvii
the
cock
fight
in
order
to
keep
the
sabbath
holy
in
the
philippines
the
people
generally
go
to
the
cock
fight
just
as
in
spain
they
go
to
the
bull
fight
cock
fighting
a
passion
introduced
into
the
country
and
exploited
for
a
century
is
one
of
the
vices
of
the
people
more
deeply
rooted
than
the
opium
vice
among
the
chinese
the
poor
go
there
to
risk
what
little
they
have
desirous
of
making
money
without
working
the
rich
go
there
to
amuse
themselves
using
the
money
which
they
have
left
over
from
their
feasts
and
thanksgiving
masses
the
cock
is
educated
with
great
care
with
more
care
perhaps
than
the
son
who
is
to
succeed
his
father
in
the
the
government
permits
it
and
almost
recommends
it
for
it
decrees
that
the
fight
shall
only
be
held
in
the
public
plazas
and
on
holidays
from
after
high
mass
till
dark
eight
hours
the
san
diego
does
not
differ
from
others
which
are
found
in
all
the
towns
it
consists
of
three
parts
the
first
or
entrance
is
a
large
rectangle
some
twenty
meters
in
length
and
fourteen
in
breadth
on
one
side
is
the
door
generally
guarded
by
a
woman
who
collects
the
entrance
fee
from
the
contribution
which
each
one
makes
the
government
receives
a
part
some
hundred
thousands
of
pesos
each
year
they
say
that
with
this
money
which
gives
license
to
the
vice
magnificent
schools
are
raised
bridges
and
roadways
constructed
and
rewards
offered
for
the
encouragement
of
agriculture
and
commerce
blessed
be
the
vice
which
produces
such
good
results
in
this
first
precinct
are
the
vendors
of
betel
nut
cigars
and
tobacco
delicacies
and
refreshments
there
the
small
boys
who
accompany
their
fathers
or
uncles
are
carefully
initiated
into
the
secrets
of
life
this
precinct
communicates
with
another
of
slightly
larger
dimensions
a
sort
of
vestibule
where
the
people
gather
before
the
fight
there
one
sees
most
of
the
cocks
tied
by
a
cord
to
a
bone
driven
into
the
ground
like
a
nail
there
are
the
bettors
the
lovers
of
the
sport
the
man
skilled
in
fastening
the
gaffs
or
spurs
to
the
cock
legs
there
bargains
are
made
the
situation
discussed
money
borrowed
and
people
curse
swear
and
laugh
boisterously
in
one
place
some
one
is
caressing
his
game
cock
passing
his
hand
over
his
brilliant
plumage
in
another
a
man
examines
and
counts
the
number
of
scales
on
the
rooster
legs
for
that
they
say
is
a
sign
of
valor
the
battles
of
the
heroes
are
related
there
too
you
will
see
many
a
disappointed
owner
with
a
sour
face
carrying
out
by
the
legs
a
dead
rooster
stripped
of
its
plumage
the
animal
which
was
a
favorite
for
months
petted
cared
for
day
and
night
and
on
which
flattering
hopes
had
been
founded
now
nothing
more
than
a
dead
fowl
to
be
sold
for
a
peseta
stewed
in
ginger
and
eaten
that
very
night
sic
transit
gloria
mundi
the
loser
returns
to
his
where
an
anxious
wife
and
ragged
children
await
him
without
his
little
capital
without
his
rooster
from
all
that
gilded
dream
from
all
the
care
of
months
from
daybreak
to
sunset
from
all
those
labors
and
fatigue
from
all
that
results
a
peseta
the
ashes
left
from
so
much
smoke
in
this
foyer
or
vestibule
the
most
ignorant
discuss
the
coming
contests
the
most
trifling
examine
conscientiously
the
bird
weigh
it
contemplate
it
extend
its
wings
feel
of
its
muscles
some
of
the
people
are
very
well
dressed
and
are
followed
and
surrounded
by
the
backers
of
their
game
cocks
others
dirty
with
the
seal
of
vice
imprinted
on
their
squalid
faces
anxiously
follow
the
movements
of
the
rich
and
watch
their
betting
for
the
pocketbook
can
be
emptied
and
the
passion
still
be
unsatisfied
there
you
see
no
face
that
is
not
animated
no
indolent
filipino
none
apathetic
none
silent
all
is
movement
passion
eagerness
from
this
place
one
passes
into
the
arena
or
rueda
as
it
is
called
the
floor
inclosed
by
bamboos
is
generally
elevated
higher
than
the
floor
of
the
other
two
parts
of
the
running
up
from
the
floor
and
almost
touching
the
roof
are
rows
of
seats
for
the
spectators
or
gamblers
they
come
to
be
the
same
during
the
combat
these
seats
are
filled
with
men
and
children
who
cry
shout
perspire
quarrel
and
blaspheme
fortunately
scarcely
any
women
visit
the
in
the
rueda
are
the
prominent
men
the
rich
class
the
bettors
the
bookmaker
and
the
referee
the
cocks
fight
on
the
ground
which
is
beaten
down
perfectly
smooth
and
there
destiny
distributes
to
families
laughter
or
tears
feasts
or
hunger
as
we
enter
we
can
see
the
gobernadorcillo
captain
pablo
captain
basilio
and
lucas
the
man
with
the
scar
on
his
face
who
was
so
disconsolate
over
the
death
of
his
brother
captain
basilio
approaches
one
of
those
present
and
asks
him
do
you
know
what
cock
captain
tiago
is
going
to
bring
i
do
not
know
señor
this
morning

him
yes
i
surely

i
stake
my
house
and
shirt
on
him
at
that
moment
captain
tiago
arrived
he
was
dressed
like
the
big
gamblers
in
a
camisa
of
canton
linen
woolen
pantaloons
and
a
hat
behind
him
came
two
servants
carrying
the
lásak
and
a
white
cock
of
colossal
proportions
sinang
tells
me
that
maria
clara
is
improving
steadily
said
captain
basilio
she
no
longer
has
any
fever
but
she
is
still
weak
did
you
lose
last
night
a
little
i
heard
that
you
won
i
am
going
to
see
if
i
can
win
back
my
money
do
you
want
to
fight
your
lásak
asked
captain
basilio
looking
at
the
rooster
that
depends
on
whether
there
is
any
money
up
how
much
will
you
stake
i
do
play
less
than
two
thousand
have
you
seen
my
bulik
asked
captain
basilio
and
then
called
a
man
to
bring
a
small
rooster
captain
tiago
examined
it
and
after
weighing
it
in
his
hand
and
examining
its
scales
he
handed
it
back
what
do
you
put
up
he
asked
whatever
you
say
two
thousand
five
hundred
make
it
three
three
let
her
go
the
circle
of
curious
people
and
gamblers
learn
that
the
two
celebrated
cocks
are
to
be
fought
both
the
roosters
have
made
a
history
for
themselves
both
have
a
reputation
all
want
to
see
and
examine
the
two
celebrities
opinions
are
expressed
and
prophecies
made
in
the
meantime
the
voices
grow
louder
the
confusion
is
augmented
the
rueda
fills
up
and
a
rush
is
made
for
the
seats
the
soltadores
bring
two
cocks
to
the
ring
for
a
preliminary
contest
one
of
the
roosters
is
blanco
white
the
other
rojo
red
they
are
already
spurred
but
the
gaffs
are
not
yet
unsheathed
cries
of
al
blanco
al
blanco
are
heard
some
one
else
shouts
al
rojo
the
blanco
is
the
favorite
civil
guards
circulate
among
the
crowd
they
are
not
wearing
the
uniform
of
their
body
nor
do
they
wear
the
costume
of
the
native
pantaloons
of
guingon
with
a
red
fringe
a
blouse
shirt
and
the
cuartel
cap
you
have
here
their
disguise
in
harmony
with
their
deportment
watching
and
betting
making
disturbance
and
talking
of
maintaining
the
peace
while
the
shouting
is
going
on
and
men
are
jingling
money
in
their
hands
while
the
people
are
going
down
in
their
pockets
for
the
last
cuarto
or
if
that
is
wanting
pledging
their
word
promising
to
sell
their
carabao
or
their
next
harvest
two
young
men
apparently
brothers
follow
the
gamblers
with
envious
eyes
they
approach
timidly
murmur
words
which
nobody
catches
and
each
time
become
more
and
more
melancholy
and
look
at
each
other
with
disgust
and
indignation
lucas
observes
them
smiles
malignantly
rattles
some
silver
pesos
passes
near
to
the
two
brothers
and
looks
toward
the
rueda
shouting
i
am
betting
fifty
fifty
against
twenty
on
the
white
the
two
brothers
exchanged
looks
i
told
you
murmured
the
older
not
to
bet
all
your
money
if
you
had
obeyed
me
we
would
have
it
now
to
put
on
the
red
the
younger
one
approached
lucas
timidly
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
is
it
you
exclaimed
the
latter
turning
around
and
feigning
surprise
does
your
brother
accept
my
proposition
or
did
you
come
to
bet
how
can
we
bet
when
we
have
lost
all
then
you
accept
he
does
not
want
to
if
you
could
lend
us
something
you
have
already
said
that
you
knew
us
lucas
scratched
his
head
pulled
down
his
camisa
and
replied
yes
i
know
you
you
are
tarsilo
and
bruno
both
young
and
strong
i
know
that
your
brave
father
died
from
the
result
of
the
hundred
lashes
which
the
soldiers
gave
him
i
know
that
you
do
not
think
of
avenging
him
you
need
not
meddle
in
our
history
interrupted
tarsilo
the
older
that
is
a
disgrace
if
we
did
not
have
a
sister
we
would
have
been
hanged
long
ago
hanged
they
only
hang
cowards
or
some
one
who
has
no
money
or
protection
certainly
the
mountains
are
near
a
hundred
against
twenty
on
the
blanco
cried
one
as
he
passed
the
group
loan
us
four
pesos
three
two
begged
the
younger
brother
presently
i
will
return
it
to
you
doubled
the
fight
is
going
to
begin
lucas
scratched
his
head
again
tst
this
money
is
not
mine
don
crisostomo
has
given
it
to
me
for
those
who
want
to
serve
him
but
i
see
that
you
are
not
like
your
father
he
was
really
courageous
and
saying
this
he
went
away
from
them
although
not
far
let
us
accept
what
does
it
matter
said
bruno
to
his
brother
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing
whether
you
are
hanged
or
shot
down
we
poor
serve
for
nothing
else
you
are
right
but
think
of
our
sister
in
the
meantime
the
circle
around
the
ring
had
been
dispersed
the
fight
was
going
to
commence
the
voices
began
to
die
away
and
the
two
soltadores
and
the
skilled
gaff
fitter
were
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
rueda
at
a
signal
from
the
referee
the
sheaths
were
removed
from
the
knives
on
the
cocks
legs
and
the
fine
blades
glistened
in
a
menacing
way
the
two
brothers
gloomy
and
silent
approached
the
ring
and
resting
their
faces
against
the
bamboo
railing
watched
the
preparations
a
man
approached
them
and
said
in
their
ears
hundred
to
ten
on
the
blanco
tarsilo
looked
at
him
stupidly
bruno
elbowed
his
brother
who
responded
with
a
grunt
the
soltadores
handle
the
roosters
with
masterly
skill
taking
great
care
not
to
wound
them
a
deep
silence
reigns
throughout
the
pit
you
would
think
that
those
present
with
the
exception
of
the
two
soltadores
were
horrible
wax
figures
the
two
roosters
are
brought
close
together
and
allowed
to
pick
at
each
other
and
thus
become
irritated
then
they
allow
them
to
look
at
each
other
so
that
the
poor
little
birds
may
know
who
has
plucked
out
their
feathers
and
with
whom
they
should
fight
the
feathers
around
the
neck
stand
up
they
look
at
each
other
fixedly
flashes
of
wrath
escape
from
their
little
round
eyes
the
moment
has
come
the
birds
are
placed
on
the
ground
in
the
ring
at
a
certain
distance
from
each
other
the
cocks
advance
slowly
their
little
steps
are
heard
upon
the
hard
floor
nobody
speaks
nobody
breathes
lowering
and
raising
their
heads
as
if
measuring
each
other
with
a
look
the
two
roosters
mutter
sounds
perhaps
of
threat
or
contempt
they
have
perceived
the
shining
blades
danger
animates
them
and
they
turn
toward
each
other
decided
but
they
stop
at
a
short
distance
and
as
they
look
at
each
other
they
bow
their
heads
and
again
raise
their
feathers
on
end
with
their
natural
valor
they
rush
at
each
other
impetuously
they
strike
beak
against
beak
breast
against
breast
blade
against
blade
and
wing
against
wing
the
blows
have
been
stopped
with
dexterity
and
skill
and
only
a
few
feathers
have
fallen
they
again
measure
each
other
suddenly
the
blanco
turns
and
raising
himself
in
the
air
flashes
his
knife
but
the
rojo
has
already
doubled
up
his
legs
ducked
his
head
and
the
blanco
has
only
cut
the
air
then
on
touching
the
ground
to
avoid
being
wounded
from
behind
he
turns
quickly
and
faces
the
other
the
red
attacks
him
with
fury
but
he
defends
himself
with
coolness
not
without
reason
was
he
the
favorite
of
the
crowd
all
trembling
and
anxious
follow
the
movements
of
the
battle
now
this
one
and
now
that
one
giving
an
involuntary
shout
the
ground
is
being
covered
with
red
and
white
feathers
tinged
with
blood
but
the
duel
does
not
go
to
the
one
who
draws
first
blood
the
filipino
here
follows
the
laws
laid
down
by
the
government
which
say
that
the
cock
which
is
killed
or
flees
loses
the
fight
the
blood
now
wets
the
ground
the
blows
are
repeated
but
the
victory
is
still
undecided
finally
making
a
supreme
effort
the
blanco
throws
himself
forward
to
give
a
last
blow
he
drives
his
knife
into
the
wing
of
the
rojo
and
buries
it
among
the
bones
but
the
blanco
has
been
wounded
in
the
breast
and
both
weak
from
loss
of
blood
and
panting
fastened
together
remain
immovable
until
the
blanco
falls
bleeds
through
his
neck
kicks
violently
and
is
in
the
agony
of
death
the
rojo
pinned
by
his
wing
is
held
to
the
other
side
and
little
by
little
he
doubles
up
his
legs
and
slowly
closes
his
eyes
then
the
referee
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
prescribed
by
the
government
declares
the
rojo
the
winner
a
wild
and
prolonged
outcry
greets
the
decision
an
outcry
which
is
heard
throughout
the
town
he
who
from
afar
hears
the
cry
understands
that
the
dejado
has
beaten
the
favorite
for
otherwise
the
outcry
would
not
have
lasted
so
long
so
it
happens
among
nations
when
a
small
nation
succeeds
in
gaining
a
victory
over
a
greater
one
the
song
and
story
of
it
last
through
centuries
do
you
see
said
bruno
with
indignation
to
his
brother
if
you
had
taken
my
advice
we
would
have
had
one
hundred
pesos
on
your
account
we
are
without
a
cuarto
tarsilo
did
not
reply
but
with
eyes
looked
around
him
as
if
in
search
of
some
one
there
he
is
talking
with
pedro
added
bruno
he
is
giving
him
money
what
a
lot
of
money
tarsilo
remained
silent
and
thoughtful
with
the
arm
of
his
camisa
he
wiped
away
the
sweat
which
formed
in
drops
on
his
forehead
brother
said
bruno
i
am
decided
even
if
you
are
not
the
lásak
ought
to
win
and
we
ought
not
to
lose
the
opportunity
i
want
to
bet
on
the
next
fight
what
does
it
matter
thus
we
will
avenge
our
father
wait
said
tarsilo
to
him
and
looked
him
in
the
eyes
both
were
pale
i
am
with
you
you
are
right
we
will
avenge
our
father
he
stopped
however
and
again
wiped
away
the
perspiration
why
do
you
stop
asked
bruno
impatiently
do
you
know
what
fight
is
the
next
one
is
it
worth
the
trouble
what
have
you
heard
captain
tiago
lásak
against
captain
basilio
bulik
according
to
the
run
of
luck
the
lásak
ought
to
win
ah
the
lásak
i
would
bet
but
let
us
make
sure
first
bruno
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
but
followed
his
brother
the
latter
looked
the
rooster
over
carefully
thought
about
it
debated
with
himself
and
asked
a
few
questions
the
unfortunate
fellow
was
in
doubt
bruno
was
nervous
and
looked
at
him
angrily
why
do
you
see
that
wide
scale
which
he
has
there
near
the
spur
do
you
see
those
feet
what
more
do
you
want
look
at
those
legs
stretch
out
his
wings
and
that
broken
scale
on
top
of
that
wide
one
and
that
double
one
tarsilo
did
not
hear
him
he
kept
on
examining
the
cock
the
rattle
of
silver
coins
reached
his
ears
let
us
see
the
bulik
now
said
he
in
a
choking
voice
bruno
stamped
the
ground
with
his
feet
grated
his
teeth
but
obeyed
his
brother
they
approached
the
other
group
there
they
were
arming
the
cock
they
were
selecting
gaffs
for
him
and
the
expert
in
fitting
them
to
the
rooster
legs
was
preparing
a
piece
of
red
silk
he
waxed
it
and
rubbed
it
over
his
knee
a
number
of
times
tarsilo
gazed
at
the
bird
with
a
sombre
air
it
seemed
that
he
was
not
looking
at
the
cock
but
at
something
in
the
future
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
are
you
ready
he
asked
his
brother
his
voice
scarcely
perceptible
i
long
ago
without
having
to
see
them
it
is
our
poor
sister
bah
did
they
tell
you
that
the
leader
is
don
crisostomo
have
you
not
seen
him
walking
with
the
governor
general
what
danger
will
we
run
and
if
we
are
killed
what
does
it
matter
our
father
died
from
being
whipped
to
death
you
are
right
both
brothers
sought
lucas
in
the
crowd
as
soon
as
they
caught
sight
of
him
tarsilo
stopped
no
let
us
go
away
from
here
we
are
going
to
lose
he
exclaimed
go
if
you
wish
i
am
going
to
accept
bruno
unfortunately
a
man
approached
them
and
said
are
you
betting
i
am
backing
the
bulik
the
two
brothers
did
not
reply
i
give
you
odds
how
much
asked
bruno
the
man
counted
out
four
peso
pieces
bruno
looked
at
him
breathless
i
have
two
hundred
fifty
to
forty
no
said
bruno
promptly
make
it
all
right
fifty
to
thirty
double
it
if
you
wish
well
the
bulik
is
my
winning
color
and
i
have
just
won
hundred
against
sixty
that
a
go
wait
till
i
go
and
get
my
money
but
i
will
be
the
said
the
other
in
whom
the
manner
of
bruno
inspired
little
confidence
it
all
the
same
to
me
responded
the
latter
trusting
in
the
strength
of
his
fists
and
turning
to
his
brother
he
said
go
away
if
you
wish
i
going
to
stay
then
tarsilo
reflected
he
loved
his
brother
and
the
game
he
could
not
leave
him
alone
and
he
murmured
let
it
be
so
they
approached
lucas
the
latter
saw
them
coming
and
smiled
eh
there
said
tarsilo
what
is
it
how
much
do
you
give
asked
the
two
brothers
i
have
already
told
you
if
you
want
to
find
some
others
to
help
us
surprise
the
cuartel
i
will
give
you
thirty
pesos
apiece
and
ten
pesos
for
each
companion

get
if
all

out
well
each
will
receive
one
hundred
pesos
and
you
two
double
that
amount
don
crisostomo

exclaimed
bruno
hand
over
the
money
i
knew
well
that
you
were
brave
like
your
father
come
let
them
hear
us
or
they
will
kill
us
said
lucas
pointing
to
the
civil
guards
and
taking
them
into
a
corner
he
told
them
as
he
counted
out
the
money
to
them
don
crisostomo
will
arrive
and
bring
arms
day
after
about
eight
at
night
come
to
the
cemetery
i
will
tell
you
about
the
final
arrangements
you
have
time
to
find
some
other
companions
they
took
leave
of
each
other
now
the
two
brothers
seemed
to
have
changed
their
rôles
tarsilo
was
calm
bruno
pale
chapter
xxviii
the
two
señoras
while
captain
tiago
was
fighting
his
lásak
against
the
bulik
doña
victorina
took
a
walk
through
the
town
with
the
intention
of
seeing
the
condition
of
the
indolent
natives
and
of
their
houses
and
fields
she
had
dressed
as
elegantly
as
she
could
putting
all
her
ribbons
and
flowers
on
her
silk
gown
in
order
to
impress
the
provincials
and
make
them
see
how
great
a
distance
was
between
them
and
her
sacred
person
giving
her
arm
to
her
lame
husband
she
fluttered
through
the
streets
of
the
town
among
the
stupefied
and
wondering
inhabitants
cousin
linares
had
remained
in
the
house
what
ugly
houses
these
natives
have
began
doña
victorina
making
a
grimace
i
do
know
how
they
can
live
there
one
must
be
a
native
to
do
it
they
meet
us
and
do
uncover
their
heads
hit
them
over
the
head
as
the
curates
and
tenientes
of
the
guardia
civil
do
when
they
do
take
off
their
hats
teach
them
manners
and
if
they
hit
me
asked
de
espadaña
are
you
a
man
bu
bu
but
i
am
la
la
lame
doña
victorina
was
becoming
the
streets
were
not
paved
and
the
train
of
her
gown
was
covered
with
dust
besides
they
met
many
young
women
who
on
passing
her
cast
down
their
eyes
and
did
not
admire
her
lavish
dress
as
they
should
have
done
sinang
coachman
who
was
driving
her
and
her
cousin
in
an
elegant
carriage
had
the
impudence
to
call
out
tabi
to
them
in
such
a
warning
voice
that
she
had
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
was
only
able
to
exclaim
look
at
that
brute
of
a
coachman
i
am
going
to
tell
his
master
that
he
should
educate
his
servants
better
let
us
go
back
to
the
house
she
ordered
her
husband
he
fearing
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
storm
turned
on
his
heels
and
obeyed
the
command
they
met
the
alferez
on
the
way
back
and
greeted
him
he
increased
the
discontent
of
doña
victorina
for
he
not
only
failed
to
compliment
her
on
her
dress
but
surveyed
it
almost
with
a
mocking
manner
you
ought
not
to
extend
your
hand
to
a
simple
alferez
said
she
to
her
husband
as
soon
as
they
were
some
distance
away
he
scarcely
touches
his
helmet
and
you
take
off
your
hat
you
do
know
how
to
maintain
your
rank
he
is
ch
ch
chief
here
and
what
does
that
matter
to
us
are
we
perchance
natives
you
are
right
replied
he
not
wishing
to
quarrel
they
passed
by
the
officer
house
doña
consolacion
was
in
the
window
as
usual
dressed
in
her
flannel
outfit
and
smoking
her
cigar
as
the
house
was
rather
low
they
could
see
each
other
as
they
passed
and
doña
victorina
could
distinguish
her
very
well
the
muse
of
the
guardia
civil
examined
her
with
tranquillity
from
head
to
foot
and
afterward
sticking
out
her
lower
lip
spit
turning
her
face
to
the
other
side
that
put
an
end
to
doña
victorina
patience
and
leaving
her
husband
without
any
support
she
squared
herself
in
front
of
the
alfereza
trembling
with
rage
and
unable
to
speak
doña
consolacion
turned
her
head
slowly
looked
her
over
again
and
then
spit
again
but
with
still
greater
disdain
what
is
the
matter
with
you
doña
said
the
alfereza
can
you
tell
me
señora
why
you
look
at
me
so
are
you
envious
doña
victorina
finally
succeeded
in
saying
i
envious
of
you
said
the
medusa
with
scorn
o
yes
i
envy
those
curls
come
wife
said
the
doctor
do
do
take
no
no
notice
of
her
let
me
give
this
shameless
common
person
a
lesson
replied
the
woman
giving
her
husband
a
push
he
nearly
fell
to
the
ground
turning
to
doña
consolacion
she
continued
look
how
you
treat
me
do
think
that
i
am
a
provincial
or
a
soldiers
querida
in
my
house
in
manila
alferezas
never
are
allowed
to
come
in
they
wait
at
the
door
most
excellent
señora
alferezas
do
enter
but
invalids
like
that
out
there
ha
ha
ha
if
it
had
been
for
all
the
paint
on
her
face
one
could
have
seen
doña
victorina
blush
she
wanted
to
throw
herself
upon
her
enemy
but
the
sentry
stopped
her
in
the
meantime
the
street
was
filling
up
with
curious
people
listen
i
lower
myself
talking
with
you
people
of
categoría
do
you
want
my
clothes
to
wash
i
will
pay
you
well
do
you
think
that
i
do
know
that
you
are
a
washerwoman
doña
consolacion
became
furious
the
reference
to
her
being
a
washerwoman
wounded
her
do
you
think
that
we
do
not
know
what
you
are
get
out
my
husband
has
already
told
me
señora
i
at
least
have
not
belonged
to
more
than
one
man
but
you
one
must
be
pretty
hard
up
to
take
the
leavings
this
shot
struck
doña
victorina
square
in
the
breast
she
rolled
up
her
sleeves
clenched
her
fists
and
gnashing
her
teeth
began
come
down
here
you
nasty
old
thing
that
i
may
smash
your
filthy
mouth
the
medusa
disappeared
quickly
from
the
window
but
was
soon
seen
coming
down
the
stairs
on
a
run
swinging
her
husband
whip
don
tiburcio
interposed
pleading
with
them
but
they
would
have
come
to
blows
if
the
alferez
had
not
arrived
but
señoras
don
tiburcio
teach
your
woman
better
buy
her
better
clothes
if
you
the
money
rob
the
people
you
have
your
soldiers
for
that
shouted
doña
victorina
señora
said
the
alferez
furiously
thank
yourself
that
i
forget
that
you
are
a
woman
for
if
you
were
not
i
would
kick
you
to
pieces
with
all
your
curls
and
ribbons
se
se
señor
al
alferez
said
don
tiburcio
go
ahead
kill
us
you
do
wear
big
enough
trousers
you
quack
and
so
the
battle
waged
words
gestures
cries
insults
and
injuries
they
brought
out
all
the
nasty
things
they
could
think
of
all
four
speaking
at
the
same
time
and
saying
so
many
things
and
bringing
to
light
so
many
truths
that
we
will
not
relate
here
all
that
was
said
the
people
who
had
gathered
around
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
if
they
understood
all
the
remarks
must
have
enjoyed
themselves
not
a
little
they
were
all
waiting
to
see
them
come
to
blows
unfortunately
for
the
spectators
the
curate
came
along
and
pacified
them
señoras
señoras
what
a
shame
señor
alferez
what
are
you
meddling
in
these
matters
for
you
hypocrite
you
carlist
don
tiburcio
take
away
your
wife
señora
hold
your
tongue
tell
that
to
those
robbers
of
the
poor
finally
the
dictionary
of
epithets
was
exhausted
the
review
of
the
disgraces
of
each
couple
was
ended
and
little
by
little
they
were
separated
threatening
and
insulting
each
other
father
salví
kept
going
from
one
side
to
the
other
adding
life
to
the
scene
this
very
day
we
will
go
to
manila
and
we
will
present
ourselves
to
the
governor
general
said
doña
victorina
in
fury
to
her
husband
you

not
a
man
it
is
a
shame
that
you
spend
money
for

the
guardia
civil
i
i

and
doña
victorina
looked
at
his
false
teeth
daughter
i
never
have
used
doña
victorina
did
not
let
him
finish
with
a
sublime
movement
she
jerked
out
his
false
teeth
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
throwing
them
to
the
ground
stepped
on
them
he
half
crying
and
she
sputtering
away
arrived
at
the
house
at
that
time
linares
was
talking
with
maria
clara
sinang
and
victoria
and
as
he
knew
nothing
about
the
quarrel
the
sudden
arrival
of
his
cousins
gave
him
a
shock
maria
clara
was
lying
on
a
sofa
among
pillows
and
blankets
and
was
not
a
little
surprised
at
the
doctor
new
physiognomy
cousin
said
doña
victorina

challenge

alferez

him
right
off
or
i
will
tell
them

but
doña
victorina
the
three
young
women
looked
at
one
another
the
alferez
has
insulted
us
the
old
witch
came
down
with
her
whip
and
that
thing
there

man

said
sinang

been
fighting

added

you
have
told
him
is
a
lie
i
will
tell
him
but
doña
victorina
doña
victorina
interrupted
linares
pale
and
going
closer
to
her
you
keep
quiet
do
make
me
call
to
mind
and
he
added
in
a
low
voice
do
be
imprudent
especially
just
now
just
at
that
time
when
this
was
going
on
captain
tiago
arrived
home
from
the
he
was
downhearted
he
had
lost
his
lásak
but
doña
victorina
did
not
give
him
much
time
to
sigh
in
a
few
words
and
with
many
insults
she
related
to
him
what
had
passed
she
of
course
trying
to
put
herself
in
a
good
light
linares
is
going
to
challenge
him
do
you
hear
if
he
do
i
let
him
marry
your
daughter
do
you
permit
it
if
he
has
no
courage
he
does
not
merit
clarita
then
you
are
going
to
marry
this
gentleman
asked
sinang
with
her
jolly
eyes
full
of
tears
i
knew
that
you
were
discreet
but
i
did
not
think
you
so
fickle
maria
clara
pale
as
wax
raising
herself
half
up
looked
at
her
father
with
frightened
eyes
and
then
at
doña
victorina
and
linares
the
latter
turned
red
in
the
face
captain
tiago
looked
down
and
the
señora
added
clarita
bear
it
in
mind
and
never
marry
a
man
who
does
not
wear
trousers
you
expose
yourself
to
insults
like
a
dog
if
you
do
but
the
young
maiden
did
not
reply
and
said
to
her
friends
take
me
to
my
room
for
i
can
not
go
alone
they
helped
her
to
her
feet
and
leaning
her
head
on
pretty
sinang
shoulder
and
with
the
arms
of
her
friend
around
her
waist
she
went
to
her
bedroom
that
night
the
doctor
and
his
wife
collected
their
things
together
submitted
their
account
to
captain
tiago
which
amounted
to
several
thousand
pesos
and
very
early
on
the
following
day
left
for
manila
in
the
captain
carriage
to
timid
linares
they
intrusted
the
rôle
of
the
avenger
chapter
xxix
the
enigma
as
lucas
had
announced
ibarra
arrived
the
next
day
his
first
visit
was
to
the
family
of
captain
tiago
with
the
object
of
seeing
maria
clara
and
telling
her
that
his
most
illustrious
greatness
had
already
reconciled
him
with
the
church
he
brought
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
the
curate
written
by
the
hand
of
the
archbishop
himself
aunt
isabel
was
not
a
little
delighted
over
it
for
she
liked
the
young
man
and
did
not
look
favorably
upon
the
marriage
of
her
niece
with
linares
captain
tiago
was
not
at
home
come
in
said
the
aunt
in
her
language
maria
don
crisostomo
is
again
in
the
grace
of
god
the
archbishop
has
him
but
the
young
man
could
not
advance
his
smile
froze
on
his
lips
and
words
fled
from
his
mind
linares
was
standing
next
to
maria
clara
on
the
balcony
interweaving
nosegays
with
the
flowers
and
leaves
on
the
climbing
plants
on
the
floor
were
scattered
roses
and
sampagas
maria
clara
was
leaning
back
on
a
sofa
pale
pensive
her
look
sad
playing
with
her
ivory
fan
but
the
fan
was
not
as
white
as
her
poor
fingers
at
the
presence
of
ibarra
linares
turned
pale
and
maria
cheeks
were
tinged
with
carmine
she
tried
to
rise
but
her
strength
failing
her
she
cast
her
eyes
upon
the
floor
and
let
fall
her
fan
an
embarrassing
silence
reigned
for
several
seconds
finally
ibarra
was
able
to
advance
and
tremblingly
murmured
i
have
just
arrived
and
have
hastened
to
see
you
i
find
that
you
are
better
than
i
thought
maria
clara
seemed
to
have
turned
dumb
she
could
not
pronounce
a
single
word
and
continued
to
keep
her
eyes
on
the
floor
ibarra
surveyed
linares
with
a
look
which
the
modest
young
man
bore
with
considerable
haughtiness
well
i
see
that
my
arrival
was
not
expected
he
said
slowly
maria
pardon
me
for
not
having
announced
my
coming
some
other
day
i
will
be
able
to
explain
to
you
my
conduct
these
words
were
accompanied
with
a
look
at
linares
the
maiden
raised
her
eyes
to
ibarra
those
beautiful
eyes
full
of
purity
and
melancholy
so
supplicating
and
sweet
that
ibarra
stopped
confused
may
i
come
you
know
that
on
my
part
you
are
always
welcome
replied
she
scarcely
able
to
pronounce
the
words
ibarra
walked
away
apparently
tranquil
but
a
tempest
raged
in
his
mind
and
his
heart
was
chilled
what
he
had
just
seen
and
felt
was
incomprehensible
what
was
it
doubt
apathy
or
treason
oh
woman
he
murmured
he
arrived
without
noticing
it
at
the
place
where
the
school
house
was
being
constructed
the
work
was
well
along
ñor
juan
with
his
yard
stick
and
was
going
to
and
fro
among
the
numerous
workmen
on
seeing
the
young
man
approach
he
ran
to
meet
him
don
crisostomo
said
he
you
have
arrived
at
last
we
were
all
expecting
you
just
see
how
the
walls
are
rising
they
are
already
a
meter
and
ten
centimeters
high
within
two
days
they
will
be
as
high
as
a
man
i
have
not
allowed
them
to
use
anything
but
the
best
of
wood
do
you
want
to
look
at
the
cellar
the
workmen
saluted
him
respectfully
here
is
the
system
of
drainage
which
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
add
said
ñor
juan
these
underground
canals
lead
to
a
cesspool
about
thirty
feet
off
it
will
serve
to
fertilize
the
garden
this
was
not
in
the
plans
do
you
object
to
it
quite
on
the
contrary
i
approve
of
it
and
i
congratulate
you
on
your
idea
you
are
a
true
architect
from
whom
did
you
learn
the
profession
from
myself
señor
replied
the
modest
old
man
o
yes
before
i
forget
it
let
the
scrupulous
people
know
for
some
may
fear
to
speak
to
me
that
i
am
no
longer
excommunicated
the
archbishop
invited
me
to
dine
with
him
pshaw
señor
we
do
take
any
notice
of
excommunications
we
are
all
excommunicated
dather
dámaso
is
himself
however
he
goes
on
as
fat
as
ever
how
that
i
feel
sure
about
it
a
year
ago
he
gave
the
coadjutor
a
blow
with
his
cane
and
the
coadjutor
is
as
much
a
priest
as
he
who
takes
any
notice
of
excommunications
señor
ibarra
caught
sight
of
elias
among
the
workmen
he
saluted
him
like
the
others
but
with
a
look
that
gave
ibarra
to
understand
that
he
wanted
to
speak
with
him
ñor
juan
said
ibarra
will
you
bring
me
a
list
of
the
workmen
ñor
juan
disappeared
and
ibarra
approached
elias
who
was
alone
raising
a
large
stone
and
loading
it
in
a
cart
if
you
are
able
señor
to
grant
me
some
hours
of
conversation
come
this
afternoon
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
embark
in
my
banca
for
i
want
to
talk
with
you
about
some
serious
matters
said
elias
ibarra
gave
a
nod
of
assent
and
went
away
ñor
juan
brought
the
list
but
ibarra
read
it
in
vain
the
name
of
elias
was
not
on
it
chapter
xxx
the
voice
of
the
persecuted
before
the
sun
went
down
ibarra
put
his
foot
into
elias
banca
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
he
seemed
displeased
about
something
as
though
he
had
been
opposed
or
contradicted
pardon
me
señor
said
elias
on
seeing
him
pardon
me
for
having
ventured
to
make
this
appointment
with
you
i
would
like
to
speak
with
you
freely
and
here
we
have
no
witnesses
we
can
return
within
an
hour
you
are
mistaken
friend
elias
replied
ibarra
trying
to
smile
you
will
have
to
take
me
to
that
town
over
there
where
you
see
that
belfry
fate
obliges
me
to
go
there
fate
yes
on
my
way
here
i
met
the
alferez
he
insisted
upon
accompanying
me
i
thought
about
you
and
knew
that
he
would
recognize
you
and
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him
i
told
him
that
i
was
going
to
that
town
now
i
will
have
to
remain
there
all
day
for
the
man
whom
i
am
going
to
see
will
not
look
for
me
till
afternoon
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
your
thoughtfulness
but
you
might
have
simply
told
him
to
accompany
you
replied
elias
with
naturalness
how
that
and
what
about
you
he
would
never
have
recognized
me
the
only
time
that
he
ever
saw
me
i
do
believe
that
he
thought
to
take
down
a
description
of
me
i
am
in
hard
luck
sighed
ibarra
thinking
of
maria
clara
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
elias
looked
around
him
they
were
far
from
the
shore
the
sun
had
already
sunk
below
the
horizon
and
as
the
twilight
in
these
latitudes
is
very
short
the
darkness
was
falling
over
the
earth
and
the
disk
of
the
full
moon
was
already
shining
señor
replied
elias
in
a
grave
voice
i
am
the
spokesman
of
many
unfortunate
people
unfortunate
people
what
do
you
mean
in
a
few
words
elias
referred
to
the
conversation
which
he
had
had
with
the
chief
of
the
tulisanes
but
omitted
saying
anything
about
the
doubts
which
the
chief
entertained
or
the
threats
ibarra
listened
attentively
and
when
elias
concluded
his
story
a
long
silence
reigned
ibarra
was
the
first
to
break
the
spell
so
that
they
desire
radical
reforms
in
the
armed
forces
in
the
religious
matters
and
in
the
administration
of
justice
that
is
to
say
they
ask
for
paternal
care
on
the
part
of
the
government
reforms
in
what
sense
for
example
more
respect
for
human
dignity
more
security
for
the
individual
less
power
in
the
hands
of
the
forces
already
armed
fewer
privileges
for
that
body
which
easily
abuses
them
elias
replied
the
young
man
i
do
know
who
you
are
but
i
believe
that
you
are
not
an
ordinary
man
you
think
and
work
differently
from
the
others
you
will
understand
me
if
i
say
to
you
that
even
if
it
is
true
that
the
present
state
of
affairs
is
defective
there
will
be
a
worse
state
if
there
is
a
change
i
could
arrange
to
get
the
assistance
of
my
friends
in
madrid
by
paying
them
i
could
speak
to
the
governor
general
but
all
of
that
would
accomplish
nothing
he
has
not
enough
power
to
introduce
reforms
nor
would
i
ever
take
a
step
in
that
direction
for
i
know
very
well
that
if
it
is
true
that
these
religious
corporations
have
their
defects
they
are
now
necessities
they
are
what
you
might
call
a
necessary
evil
elias
raised
his
head
and
looked
astonished
do
you
believe
señor
in
necessary
evils
he
asked
his
voice
slightly
trembling
do
you
believe
that
in
order
to
do
good
it
is
necessary
to
do
evil
no
i
look
upon
it
as
a
violent
remedy
which
we
have
to
make
use
of
to
cure
an
illness
to
illustrate
further
the
country
is
an
organism
which
is
suffering
from
a
chronic
illness
and
in
order
to
cure
it
the
government
finds
itself
compelled
to
use
medicines
hard
and
violent
if
you
wish
but
useful
and
necessary
he
is
a
bad
doctor
señor
who
seeks
to
cure
the
symptoms
and
suppress
them
without
trying
to
find
the
origin
of
the
illness
or
knowing
it
fears
to
attack
it
the
guardia
civil
has
no
other
end
than
this
the
suppression
of
crime
by
terror
and
force
this
end
it
neither
fulfills
nor
carries
out
except
in
chance
instances
and
you
have
to
take
into
account
that
society
can
be
severe
with
individuals
only
after
she
has
furnished
all
means
necessary
for
their
perfect
morality
in
our
country
since
there
is
no
society
since
the
people
and
the
government
do
not
form
a
unity
the
latter
ought
to
be
indulgent
not
only
because
indulgence
is
necessary
but
because
the
individual
neglected
and
abandoned
by
government
has
less
self
responsibility
than
if
he
had
been
enlightened
besides
following
out
your
comparison
the
medicine
applied
to
the
evils
of
the
country
is
so
much
of
a
destroyer
that
its
effect
is
only
felt
on
the
sane
parts
of
the
organism
these
it
weakens
and
injures
would
it
not
be
more
reasonable
to
fortify
and
strengthen
the
infirm
organism
and
minimize
a
little
the
violence
of
the
medicine
to
weaken
the
guardia
civil
would
be
to
put
the
security
of
the
towns
in
danger
the
security
of
the
towns
exclaimed
elias
with
bitterness
the
towns
have
had
the
guardia
civil
for
nearly
fifteen
years
and
what
is
the
result
we
still
have
tulisanes
we
still
hear
of
them
sacking
towns
and
they
still
make
their
attacks
on
people
on
the
roads
robberies
continue
and
the
robbers
are
not
punished
crime
exists
and
the
real
criminal
goes
free
but
not
so
with
the
peaceful
inhabitants
of
the
town
ask
any
honorable
citizen
if
he
looks
upon
this
institution
as
a
good
as
a
protection
by
the
government
or
as
an
imposition
a
despotism
whose
excesses
do
more
harm
than
the
violence
of
the
criminals
communication
between
people
is
paralyzed
for
they
fear
to
be
maltreated
for
trifling
causes
more
importance
is
attached
to
the
formality
of
the
law
than
to
the
basal
principle
of
it
the
first
symptom
of
incapacity
in
government
the
heads
of
the
organization
consider
it
their
first
duty
to
make
people
salute
them
either
of
their
own
will
or
by
force
even
in
the
darkness
of
night
in
this
their
inferior
officers
imitate
them
and
maltreat
and
fleece
the
poor
countrymen
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sacredness
of
the
fireside
there
is
no
security
for
the
individual
what
have
the
people
accomplished
by
overcoming
their
wrath
and
by
waiting
for
justice
at
the
hands
of
others
ah
señor
if
you
call
that
preserving
the
order
i
agree
with
you
that
there
are
evils
replied
ibarra
but
we
have
to
accept
those
evils
for
the
good
which
accompanies
them
this
institution
may
be
imperfect
but
believe
me
by
the
terror
which
it
inspires
it
prevents
the
number
of
criminals
from
increasing
you
might
better
say
that
by
that
terror
it
increases
the
number
of
criminals
said
elias
correcting
him
before
this
body
was
created
almost
all
the
evildoers
with
the
exception
of
a
very
few
were
criminals
because
of
their
hunger
they
pillaged
and
robbed
in
order
to
live
that
famine
once
passed
over
and
hunger
once
satisfied
the
roads
were
again
free
from
criminals
it
was
sufficient
to
have
the
poor
but
valiant
cuaderilleros
chase
them
with
their
imperfect
arms
that
body
of
men
so
often
calumniated
by
those
who
have
written
upon
our
country
those
men
who
have
three
legal
rights
to
do
their
duty
to
fight
and
to
die
and
for
all
that
a
jest
as
recompense
now
there
are
tulisanes
who
will
be
tulisanes
all
their
lives
a
crime
inhumanly
punished
resistance
against
the
excesses
of
the
power
which
inflicts
such
punishment
and
fear
that
other
atrocities
may
be
inflicted
these
make
them
forever
members
of
that
society
who
are
bound
by
oath
to
kill
and
die
the
terrorism
of
the
guardia
civil
impressed
upon
them
closes
forever
the
doors
to
repentance
and
as
a
tulisan
fights
and
defends
himself
in
the
mountains
better
than
a
soldier
whom
he
scorns
the
result
is
that
we
are
incapable
of
abating
the
evil
which
we
have
created
call
to
mind
what
the
prudent
governor
general
de
la
torre
did
the
amnesty
which
he
granted
to
these
unhappy
people
has
proved
that
in
these
mountains
the
hearts
of
men
still
beat
and
only
await
pardon
terrorism
is
useful
only
when
the
people
are
enslaved
when
the
mountains
have
no
caverns
when
the
governing
power
can
station
a
sentry
behind
every
tree
and
when
the
slave
has
in
his
body
nothing
but
a
stomach
but
when
the
desperado
who
fights
for
his
life
feels
the
strong
arm
of
that
power
then
his
heart
beats
and
his
being
fills
with
passion
can
terrorism
put
out
the
fire
which
it
confuses
me
elias
to
hear
you
talk
so
i
would
believe
that
you
were
right
if
i
did
not
have
my
own
convictions
but
note
this
point
and
do
not
be
offended
for
i
do
not
include
you
i
look
upon
you
as
an
exception
consider
who
those
are
who
ask
for
this
reform
almost
all
are
criminals
or
people
who
are
in
the
way
of
becoming
such
criminals
or
future
criminals
but
why
are
they
so
because
their
peace
has
been
disturbed
their
happiness
taken
away
from
them
their
dearest
affections
wounded
and
after
asking
protection
from
justice
they
have
been
convinced
that
they
can
secure
it
only
by
their
own
hands
by
their
own
efforts
but
you
are
mistaken
señor
if
you
believe
that
only
criminals
ask
for
it
go
from
town
to
town
from
house
to
house
listen
to
the
secret
sighings
of
the
family
and
you
will
be
convinced
that
the
evils
which
the
guardia
civil
causes
are
equal
to
if
not
greater
than
those
which
it
corrects
would
you
conclude
then
that
all
the
citizens
are
criminals
then
why
defend
them
from
the
others
why
not
destroy
them
there
is
some
flaw
in
your
reasoning
which
escapes
me
now
in
spain
the
mother
country
this
body
lends
and
has
lent
very
useful
services
i
do
not
doubt
it
perhaps
there
it
is
better
organized
the
personnel
more
select
perhaps
too
spain
needs
such
a
body
but
the
philippines
do
not
our
customs
our
mode
of
living
which
are
always
cited
when
any
one
wants
to
deny
us
a
right
are
totally
forgotten
when
some
one
wants
to
impose
something
on
us
and
tell
me
señor
why
have
not
other
nations
adopted
this
institution
other
nations
which
resemble
spain
more
than
do
the
philippines
is
it
due
to
the
efforts
of
such
an
institution
that
other
nations
have
fewer
robberies
of
the
railways
fewer
riots
fewer
assassinations
and
less
fighting
in
their
great
capitals
ibarra
bowed
his
head
in
meditation
afterward
he
raised
it
and
replied
that
question
my
friend
needs
serious
study
if
my
investigations
tell
me
that
these
complaints
are
well
founded
i
will
write
to
my
friends
in
madrid
since
we
have
no
deputies
to
represent
us
in
the
meantime
believe
me
the
government
needs
a
body
like
the
guardia
civil
which
has
unlimited
power
in
order
to
make
the
people
respect
its
authority
and
the
laws
imposed
that
would
be
all
right
señor
if
the
government
were
at
war
with
the
country
but
for
the
good
of
the
government
we
ought
not
to
make
the
people
believe
that
they
are
in
opposition
to
the
law
furthermore
if
that
were
the
case
if
we
preferred
force
to
prestige
we
ought
to
look
well
to
whom
we
give
this
unlimited
force
or
power
this
authority
such
great
power
in
the
hands
of
men
and
ignorant
men
at
that
men
full
of
passion
without
moral
education
without
tested
honor
such
a
thing
is
a
weapon
in
the
hands
of
a
maniac
in
a
multitude
of
unarmed
people
i
grant
and
i
will
agree
with
you
that
the
government
needs
this
weapon
but
let
it
choose
that
weapon
well
let
it
choose
the
most
worthy
men
to
bear
it
elias
was
speaking
with
enthusiasm
and
with
fervor
his
eyes
glistened
and
his
voice
vibrated
then
followed
a
solemn
pause
the
banca
no
longer
propelled
by
the
paddle
floated
tranquilly
on
the
waves
the
moon
was
shining
majestically
from
a
sapphire
sky
some
lights
were
glimmering
on
the
shore
and
what
more
do
they
ask
said
ibarra
reforms
in
the
priesthood
responded
elias
in
a
discouraged
and
sad
tone
of
voice
the
unfortunates
ask
more
protection
against
against
the
religious
orders
against
their
oppressors
señor
have
the
filipinos
forgotten
what
they
owe
to
these
orders
have
they
forgotten
the
immense
debt
of
gratitude
they
owe
to
them
for
having
saved
them
from
error
and
given
them
the
faith
what
they
owe
to
them
for
protection
against
the
civil
power
here
is
one
of
the
evils
which
result
from
not
teaching
the
history
of
the
country
in
our
schools
elias
surprised
could
scarcely
give
credit
to
what
he
heard
señor
he
replied
in
a
grave
voice
you
accuse
the
people
of
ingratitude
permit
me
one
of
those
who
suffer
to
defend
the
people
favors
in
order
to
be
recognized
as
such
must
be
done
by
persons
with
disinterested
motives
let
us
consider
in
a
general
way
the
mission
of
the
orders
of
christian
charity
that
threadbare
subject
let
us
lay
history
aside
let
us
not
ask
what
spain
did
with
the
jews
who
gave
all
europe
a
book
a
religion
and
a
god
let
us
not
ask
what
spain
has
done
with
the
arabic
people
who
gave
her
culture
who
were
tolerant
in
religion
and
who
reawakened
in
her
a
pure
national
love
fallen
into
lethargy
and
almost
destroyed
by
the
domination
of
romans
and
goths
let
us
omit
all
that
do
you
say
that
these
orders
have
given
us
the
faith
and
have
saved
us
from
error
do
you
call
those
outward
ceremonies
faith
do
you
call
that
commerce
in
straps
and
scapularies
religion
do
you
call
those
miracles
and
stories
which
we
hear
every
day
truth
is
that
the
law
of
jesus
christ
to
teach
such
a
faith
as
this
it
was
not
at
all
necessary
that
a
god
should
allow
himself
to
be
crucified
superstition
existed
long
before
the
friars
came
here
it
was
only
necessary
to
perfect
it
and
to
raise
the
price
of
the
traffic
will
you
tell
me
that
although
our
religion
of
is
imperfect
it
is
better
than
that
which
we
had
before
i
will
agree
with
you
in
that
and
grant
it
but
we
have
purchased
it
at
too
high
a
price
if
we
have
had
to
renounce
our
nationality
and
independence
for
it
when
for
it
we
have
given
to
the
priests
our
best
towns
our
fields
and
still
give
them
our
little
savings
in
order
to
buy
religious
objects
a
foreign
industry
has
been
introduced
among
us
we
pay
well
for
it
and
are
in
peace
if
you
speak
of
the
protection
they
have
afforded
us
against
the
civil
governors
of
the
provinces
i
would
reply
that
through
them
we
fall
under
the
power
of
these
governors
however
i
recognize
that
a
true
faith
and
a
true
love
for
humanity
guided
the
first
missionaries
who
came
to
our
shores
i
recognize
the
debt
of
gratitude
which
is
due
those
noble
hearts
i
know
that
in
those
days
spain
abounded
in
heroes
of
all
kinds
as
well
in
religion
as
in
politics
as
well
in
civil
life
as
in
military
but
because
the
forefathers
were
virtuous
should
we
consent
to
the
abuses
practiced
by
their
degenerate
descendants
because
a
great
good
has
been
done
for
us
are
we
guilty
if
we
prevent
ourselves
from
being
harmed
the
country
does
not
ask
for
abolition
of
the
priesthood
it
only
asks
for
reforms
which
new
circumstances
and
new
needs
require
i
love
our
country
as
you
love
it
elias
i
understand
to
some
extent
what
you
desire
i
have
heard
with
attention
what
you
have
said
yet
despite
all
of
that
my
friend
i
believe
we
are
looking
upon
it
with
a
little
prejudice
here
less
than
in
other
things
i
see
the
necessity
of
reforms
can
it
be
possible
señor
said
elias
discouraged
and
stretching
out
his
hands
do
you
not
see
the
necessity
of
reforms
you
whose
family
ah
i
forget
myself
and
i
forget
my
own
injuries
for
the
sake
of
the
security
of
the
philippines
for
the
sake
of
the
interests
of
spain
interrupted
ibarra
eagerly
to
preserve
the
philippines
it
is
necessary
that
the
friars
continue
as
they
are
and
in
union
with
spain
lies
the
welfare
of
our
country
ibarra
had
ceased
speaking
but
elias
continued
to
listen
his
face
was
sad
his
eyes
had
lost
their
brilliancy
the
missionaries
conquered
the
country
it
is
true
he
said
do
you
think
that
spain
will
be
able
to
keep
the
philippines
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
friars
yes
only
through
the
friars
this
is
the
belief
held
by
all
who
have
written
on
the
philippines
oh
exclaimed
elias
discouraged
and
throwing
his
paddle
into
the
bottom
of
the
banca
i
did
not
think
that
you
had
so
poor
a
conception
of
the
government
and
of
the
country
ibarra
replied
i
love
our
country
not
only
because
it
is
the
duty
of
all
men
to
love
the
country
to
which
they
owe
their
being
not
only
because
my
father
taught
me
so
but
also
because
my
mother
was
a
native
an
indian
and
because
all
my
most
beautiful
memories
live
in
these
islands
i
love
it
too
because
i
owe
it
my
happiness
and
will
continue
to
do
so
and
i
i
love
it
because
i
owe
to
it
my
misfortunes
said
elias
yes
my
friend
i
know
that
you
are
suffering
that
you
are
unfortunate
and
that
this
makes
you
see
a
dark
future
and
influences
your
way
of
thinking
for
this
reason
i
make
allowance
for
your
complaints
if
i
were
able
to
appreciate
the
motives
if
i
had
known
part
of
that
past
my
misfortunes
have
another
source
if
i
had
known
that
they
would
have
been
of
usefulness
i
would
have
related
them
for
aside
from
that
i
make
no
secret
of
them
they
are
well
enough
known
by
many
perhaps
knowing
them
would
rectify
my
opinions
you
know
i
do
not
rely
much
upon
theories
facts
are
better
guides
elias
remained
pensive
for
some
moments
if
that
is
the
case
señor
he
replied
i
will
relate
briefly
the
history
of
my
misfortunes
chapter
xxxi
elias
family
some
sixty
years
ago
my
grandfather
lived
in
manila
and
kept
books
for
a
spanish
merchant
my
grandfather
was
then
very
young
but
was
married
and
had
a
son
one
night
without
any
one
knowing
the
cause
the
was
burned
the
fire
spread
to
the
store
and
from
the
store
to
many
others
the
losses
were
very
heavy
search
was
made
for
the
incendiary
and
the
merchant
accused
my
grandfather
in
vain
he
protested
and
as
he
was
poor
and
could
not
pay
celebrated
lawyers
he
was
condemned
to
be
whipped
publicly
and
to
be
led
through
the
streets
of
manila
it
was
not
a
great
while
ago
that
this
infamous
punishment
was
still
in
use
here
it
was
a
thousand
times
worse
than
death
itself
my
grandfather
abandoned
by
everybody
except
his
wife
was
tied
to
a
horse
and
followed
by
a
cruel
multitude
was
whipped
on
every
corner
in
the
sight
of
men
his
brothers
and
in
the
vicinity
of
the
numerous
temples
of
the
god
of
peace
when
the
unfortunate
man
disgraced
forever
had
satisfied
the
punishment
by
his
blood
his
tortures
and
his
cries
they
untied
him
from
the
horse
for
he
had
become
unconscious
would
to
god
he
had
died
as
a
refined
cruelty
they
gave
him
liberty
his
wife
embarrassed
with
a
child
at
the
time
begged
in
vain
from
door
to
door
for
work
or
alms
that
she
might
care
for
her
sick
husband
and
the
poor
son
but
who
would
have
confidence
in
the
wife
of
an
infamous
man
guilty
of
arson
the
wife
then
had
to
give
herself
up
to
prostitution
ibarra
started
from
his
seat
oh
do
not
be
disturbed
prostitution
was
not
the
only
dishonor
which
she
and
her
husband
suffered
honor
and
shame
no
longer
existed
for
them
the
husband
cured
his
wounds
and
with
his
wife
and
son
hid
in
the
mountains
of
this
province
here
the
woman
brought
forth
a
child
deformed
and
full
of
disease
in
the
mountains
they
lived
for
several
months
miserable
isolated
hated
and
fleeing
from
all
unable
to
endure
the
misery
less
valorous
than
his
wife
and
growing
desperate
at
seeing
her
ill
and
deprived
of
all
aid
and
comfort
my
grandfather
hanged
himself
the
body
rotted
in
the
sight
of
the
son
who
was
now
scarcely
able
to
take
care
of
his
sick
mother
the
bad
odor
of
the
rotting
corpse
disclosed
it
to
justice
my
grandmother
was
accused
and
condemned
for
not
having
given
notice
the
death
of
her
husband
was
attributed
to
her
and
people
believed
it
for
what
is
a
wife
of
a
wretch
not
capable
of
doing
after
having
prostituted
herself
if
she
took
oath
they
said
she
perjured
herself
if
she
wept
they
said
that
it
was
false
and
if
she
invoked
god
they
said
she
blasphemed
however
they
had
some
consideration
for
her
and
waited
for
her
to
give
birth
to
a
child
before
whipping
her
you
know
that
the
friars
spread
the
belief
that
the
only
way
to
deal
with
the
natives
is
with
the
whip
read
what
father
gaspar
de
san
augustin
says
thus
condemned
the
woman
cursed
the
day
when
she
would
give
birth
to
the
child
and
this
not
only
prolonged
her
punishment
but
violated
her
maternal
sentiments
the
woman
delivered
the
child
and
unfortunately
the
child
was
born
robust
two
months
later
the
sentence
of
whipping
which
had
been
imposed
upon
her
was
carried
out
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
people
who
thought
that
in
this
way
they
were
fulfilling
their
duty
no
longer
able
to
be
at
peace
in
these
mountains
she
fled
with
her
two
sons
to
a
neighboring
province
and
there
they
lived
like
wild
beasts
hating
and
hated
the
older
boy
remembering
his
happy
infancy
and
its
contrast
with
such
great
misery
became
a
tulisan
as
soon
as
he
had
sufficient
strength
before
long
the
bloody
name
of
bálat
extended
from
province
to
province
it
was
the
terror
of
the
towns
and
the
people
for
he
took
his
revenge
with
fire
and
blood
the
younger
boy
who
had
received
from
nature
a
good
heart
resigned
himself
to
his
lot
at
his
mother
side
they
lived
on
what
the
forests
afforded
them
they
dressed
in
the
rags
that
travellers
threw
away
the
mother
had
lost
her
good
name
she
was
now
known
only
by
such
titles
as
the
the
and
the
woman
the
younger
brother
was
known
only
as
the
son
of
his
mother
because
he
had
such
a
pleasant
disposition
that
they
did
not
believe
him
to
be
the
son
of
the
incendiary
finally
the
famous
bálat
fell
one
day
into
the
hands
of
justice
society
had
taught
him
no
good
but
he
was
asked
to
account
for
his
crimes
one
morning
as
the
younger
boy
was
looking
for
his
mother
who
had
gone
to
gather
mushrooms
from
the
forest
and
had
not
yet
returned
he
found
her
lying
on
the
ground
by
the
roadside
under
a
her
face
was
turned
toward
the
sky
her
eyes
were
torn
from
their
sockets
and
her
rigid
fingers
were
buried
in
the
earth
it
occurred
to
the
young
man
to
raise
his
eyes
and
follow
the
direction
in
which
his
mother
had
been
looking
and
there
from
a
limb
of
a
tree
he
saw
a
basket
and
in
that
basket
the
bloody
head
of
his
brother
my
god
exclaimed
ibarra
that
is
what
my
father
must
have
exclaimed
continued
elias
coldly
the
men
had
cut
the
highwayman
into
quarters
and
buried
him
in
a
trunk
of
a
tree
but
the
limbs
were
saved
and
were
hung
up
in
different
towns
if
you
go
some
time
from
calamba
to
santo
tomás
you
will
still
find
the
rotting
leg
of
my
uncle
hanging
from
a
lomboy
tree
nature
has
cursed
the
tree
and
it
neither
grows
nor
gives
fruit
they
did
the
same
thing
with
the
other
members
of
his
body
but
the
head
the
head
as
the
best
part
of
the
man
and
that
part
which
can
be
most
easily
recognized
they
hung
before
the
mother
cabin
ibarra
bowed
his
head
the
young
man
fled
like
one
that
is
accursed
continued
elias
he
fled
from
town
to
town
through
mountains
and
valleys
and
when
at
last
he
thought
he
was
not
recognized
by
any
one
he
began
to
work
in
the
store
of
a
rich
man
in
the
province
of
tayabas
his
activity
his
agreeable
disposition
won
for
him
the
esteem
of
those
who
did
not
know
his
past
life
by
working
and
saving
he
managed
to
make
a
little
capital
and
as
the
misery
had
passed
away
and
as
he
was
young
he
thought
that
he
would
be
happy
his
good
appearance
his
youth
and
his
quite
unencumbered
position
won
for
him
the
love
of
a
girl
in
the
town
but
he
did
not
dare
to
ask
for
her
hand
for
fear
that
she
might
learn
of
his
past
but
love
became
too
strong
and
both
erred
the
man
in
order
to
save
the
honor
of
the
woman
risked
all
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
the
papers
were
looked
up
and
all
was
disclosed
the
girl
father
was
rich
and
began
to
prosecute
the
man
the
latter
however
did
not
try
to
defend
himself
admitted
it
all
and
was
sent
to
jail
the
young
woman
gave
birth
to
a
boy
and
a
girl
they
were
brought
up
in
seclusion
and
made
to
believe
that
their
father
was
dead
this
was
not
difficult
for
while
the
children
were
still
young
they
saw
their
mother
die
and
they
thought
little
about
investigating
their
genealogy
as
our
grandfather
was
very
rich
our
youth
was
happy
my
sister
and
i
were
educated
together
we
loved
each
other
as
only
twins
can
when
they
know
no
other
love
while
very
young
i
went
to
study
in
the
jesuit
college
and
my
sister
in
order
that
we
might
not
be
entirely
separated
went
to
the
concordia
boarding
school
our
short
education
having
been
ended
for
we
only
wished
to
be
farmers
we
returned
to
the
town
to
take
possession
of
the
inheritance
which
was
left
us
by
our
grandfather
we
lived
happily
for
some
time
the
future
smiled
on
us
we
had
many
servants
our
fields
bore
good
crops
and
my
sister
was
on
the
eve
of
being
married
to
a
young
man
who
loved
her
and
to
whom
she
was
well
suited
on
account
of
some
pecuniary
questions
and
because
my
character
was
then
haughty
i
lost
the
good
will
of
a
distant
relative
and
he
threw
in
my
face
one
day
my
dark
birth
and
my
infamous
ancestry
i
thought
it
a
calumny
and
demanded
satisfaction
the
tomb
in
which
so
much
grief
was
sleeping
was
opened
again
and
the
truth
came
out
i
was
confounded
to
make
the
misfortune
greater
we
had
had
for
some
years
an
old
servant
who
had
always
suffered
all
my
caprices
without
ever
leaving
us
he
contented
himself
by
weeping
and
crying
while
the
other
servants
jested
with
him
i
do
not
know
how
my
relative
found
it
out
the
fact
is
that
he
summoned
this
old
man
before
the
court
and
made
him
tell
the
truth
the
old
servant
was
my
father
who
had
stuck
fast
to
his
dear
children
and
whom
i
had
maltreated
many
times
our
happiness
disappeared
i
renounced
our
fortune
my
sister
lost
her
lover
and
with
our
father
we
abandoned
the
town
to
go
to
some
other
point
the
thought
of
having
contributed
to
our
disgrace
and
misfortune
cut
short
the
life
of
the
old
man
from
whose
lips
was
learned
all
the
sorrowful
past
my
sister
and
i
were
left
alone
she
wept
a
great
deal
but
amid
such
grief
as
they
piled
upon
us
she
could
not
forget
her
love
without
complaining
without
saying
a
word
she
saw
her
old
lover
marry
another
girl
and
i
saw
her
a
little
later
gradually
become
ill
without
being
able
to
console
her
one
day
she
disappeared
in
vain
i
searched
for
her
everywhere
in
vain
i
asked
for
her
for
six
months
afterward
i
learned
that
during
the
time
while
i
was
searching
for
her
one
day
when
the
water
had
risen
in
the
lake
there
had
been
found
on
the
beach
at
calamba
the
body
of
a
girl
either
drowned
or
assassinated
she
had
they
say
a
knife
piercing
her
breast
the
authorities
of
calamba
published
the
fact
in
the
neighboring
towns
nobody
presented
himself
to
claim
the
body
no
young
woman
had
disappeared
from
the
description
which
they
gave
me
afterward
from
the
dress
the
rings
the
beauty
of
her
face
and
her
very
abundant
hair
i
recognized
her
as
my
poor
sister
from
that
time
i
have
been
wandering
from
province
to
province
my
fame
and
history
are
in
the
mouths
of
many
people
they
attribute
all
sorts
of
deeds
to
me
at
times
they
calumniate
me
but
i
take
no
notice
of
men
and
continue
on
my
way
i
have
here
briefly
related
my
history
and
that
of
a
judgment
at
the
hands
of
mankind
elias
became
silent
and
continued
rowing
i
believe
that
you
are
not
wrong
murmured
ibarra
in
a
low
voice
when
you
say
that
justice
ought
to
procure
the
welfare
of
the
people
by
lifting
up
the
criminals
and
by
raising
the
standard
of
their
morality
only
that
is
impossible
a
utopia
and
then
where
is
the
money
for
so
many
new
employees
to
come
from
and
what
are
the
priests
for
the
priests
who
proclaim
peace
and
charity
as
their
mission
is
it
more
meritorious
for
a
priest
to
wet
the
head
of
a
child
to
give
it
salt
to
eat
than
to
awaken
in
the
darkened
conscience
of
a
criminal
that
spark
given
by
god
to
every
man
that
he
may
seek
to
do
good
is
it
more
human
to
accompany
a
criminal
to
the
gallows
than
to
accompany
him
through
the
difficult
path
which
leads
from
vice
to
virtue
are
not
spies
executioners
and
guardias
civiles
paid
the
latter
institution
besides
being
an
evil
also
costs
money
my
friend
neither
you
nor
i
although
we
wish
it
can
accomplish
it
alone
we
are
nothing
it
is
true
take
up
the
cause
of
the
people
unite
them
listen
to
their
voices
give
others
an
example
to
follow
give
them
the
idea
of
what
is
called
a
fatherland
a
patria
what
the
people
ask
for
is
impossible
we
must
wait
to
wait
to
wait
is
equivalent
to
suffering
if
i
should
ask
it
they
would
laugh
at
me
and
if
the
people
should
sustain
you
never
i
would
never
be
the
one
to
lead
the
multitude
and
accomplish
by
force
what
the
government
does
not
believe
is
opportune
no
if
i
ever
saw
the
multitude
armed
for
such
a
purpose
i
would
put
myself
on
the
side
of
the
government
and
i
would
fight
it
for
in
such
a
mob
i
would
not
see
my
country
i
wish
for
its
welfare
that
is
the
reason
that
i
am
erecting
the
i
look
for
it
through
means
of
instruction
education
and
progress
without
light
there
is
no
road
nor
without
fighting
is
there
liberty
replied
elias
i
do
not
care
for
that
kind
of
liberty
without
liberty
there
is
no
light
replied
the
pilot
with
enthusiasm
you
say
that
you
know
very
little
about
our
country
i
believe
it
you
do
not
see
the
fight
that
is
impending
you
do
not
see
the
cloud
on
the
horizon
the
combat
begins
in
the
sphere
of
ideas
and
then
descends
to
the
arena
to
tinge
it
with
blood
i
hear
the
voice
of
god
woe
to
them
who
resist
it
history
has
not
been
written
for
them
elias
was
transformed
as
he
stood
up
his
head
uncovered
his
manly
face
illumined
by
the
moonlight
there
was
something
extraordinary
about
him
he
shook
his
long
hair
and
continued
do
you
not
see
how
all
is
awakening
sleep
has
lasted
for
centuries
but
one
day
a
thunderbolt
will
fall
and
new
life
will
be
called
forth
new
tendencies
are
animating
the
spirits
and
these
tendencies
separated
will
be
united
some
day
and
will
be
guided
by
god
god
has
not
failed
other
peoples
nor
will
he
fail
ours
their
cause
is
liberty
a
solemn
silence
followed
these
words
in
the
meantime
the
banca
carried
along
imperceptibly
by
the
waves
neared
the
shore
elias
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
what
have
i
to
say
to
those
who
have
sent
me
he
asked
changing
the
tone
of
his
voice
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
greatly
deplore
their
condition
but
for
them
to
wait
since
evils
are
not
cured
by
other
evils
in
our
misfortune
we
are
all
at
fault
elias
did
not
insist
further
he
bowed
his
head
continued
rowing
and
bringing
the
banca
up
to
the
shore
took
leave
of
ibarra
saying
i
thank
you
señor
for
your
condescension
for
your
own
interests
i
ask
you
in
the
future
to
forget
me
and
never
to
recognize
me
in
whatever
place
you
may
meet
me
and
saying
this
he
turned
his
banca
and
rowed
in
the
direction
of
a
dense
thicket
on
the
beach
he
seemed
to
observe
only
the
millions
of
diamonds
which
his
paddle
lifted
and
which
fell
back
into
the
lake
where
they
soon
disappeared
in
the
mystery
of
the
blue
waves
finally
he
arrived
at
the
place
toward
which
he
had
been
rowing
a
man
came
out
of
the
thicket
and
approached
him
what
shall
i
tell
the
captain
he
asked
tell
him
that
elias
if
he
does
not
die
before
will
fulfill
his
word
he
replied
gloomily
then
when
will
you
meet
us
when
your
captain
thinks
that
the
hour
of
danger
has
come
all
right
if
i
do
not
die
before
murmured
elias
chapter

changes
the
modest
linares
was
serious
and
very
uneasy
he
had
just
received
a
letter
from
doña
victorina
which
translated
from
the
most
illiterate
spanish
and
omitting
its
many
errors
in
spelling
and
punctuation
was
as
follows
esteemed
cousin
within
three
days
i
want
to
know
from
you
if
you
have
killed
the
alferez
or
he
you
i
do
want
another
day
to
pass
without
this
animal
being
punished
if
this
length
of
time
passes
and
still
you
have
not
challenged
him
i
will
tell
don
santiago
that
you
never
were
secretary
and
that
you
never
joked
with
canovas
or
with
general
martinez
i
will
tell
clarita
that
it
is
all
a
lie
and
i
will
not
give
you
another
cuarto
if
you
challenge
him
i
promise
you
all
that
you
wish
if
you
do
not
challenge
him
i
will
accept
no
excuses
or
reasons
your

monday
eve
it
was
a
serious
matter
linares
knew
doña
victorina
character
and
knew
what
she
was
capable
of
doing
to
reason
with
her
was
out
of
the
question
to
beg
was
useless
to
deceive
her
worse
there
was
no
other
remedy
than
to
challenge
but
what
can
i
do
he
said
to
himself
as
he
was
walking
alone
if
he
receives
me
harshly
if
i
meet
his
wife
who
would
want
to
be
my
second
the
curate
captain
tiago
cursed
be
the
hour
in
which
i
gave
ear
to
her
advice
what
will
this
señorita
say
about
me
now
i
am
sorry
to
have
been
secretary
to
all
the
ministers
the
good
linares
was
in
this
sad
soliloquy
when
father
salví
arrived
the
franciscan
was
certainly
thinner
and
paler
than
usual
but
his
eyes
shone
with
a
peculiar
light
and
a
strange
smile
was
seen
on
his
lips
señor
linares
all
alone
saluted
the
priest
and
directed
his
steps
to
the
sala
through
the
half
open
door
of
which
notes
of
the
piano
were
heard
linares
restrained
a
smile
and
don
santiago
added
the
curate
captain
tiago
presented
himself
at
that
moment
kissed
the
hand
took
the
father
hat
and
cane
and
smiled
like
one
who
had
been
blessed
well
well
said
the
curate
going
into
the
sala
followed
by
linares
and
captain
tiago
i
have
good
news
from
manila
which
you
will
all
enjoy
i
have
received
letters
from
manila
which
confirm
the
one
which
señor
ibarra
brought
me
yesterday
so
that
don
santiago
the
impediment
is
removed
maria
clara
was
seated
at
the
piano
between
her
two
girl
friends
she
half
rose
to
her
feet
at
this
remark
but
her
strength
failed
her
and
she
sat
down
again
linares
turned
pale
and
looked
at
captain
tiago
who
turned
his
eyes
to
the
floor
this
young
man
really
seems
to
me
a
very
nice
fellow
continued
the
curate
at
first
i
judged
him
bad
he
is
a
little
but
he
knows
so
well
how
to
atone
for
his
faults
afterward
that
one
can
not
hold
any
grudge
against
him
if
it
were
not
for
father
dámaso
and
the
curate
directed
a
quick
glance
at
maria
clara
she
was
listening
to
all
that
was
going
on
but
without
taking
her
eyes
off
the
music
in
spite
of
the
concealed
pinches
which
sinang
gave
her
to
express
her
joy
had
she
been
alone
she
would
have
danced
father
dámaso
asked
linares
without
finishing
the
sentence
yes
continued
the
curate
father
dámaso
has
said
that
as
godfather
he
could
not
permit
but
i
believe
that
if
finally
señor
ibarra
asks
pardon
which
i
do
not
doubt
he
will
do
all
will
be
arranged
maria
clara
arose
made
an
excuse
and
retired
to
her
room
accompanied
by
victoria
and
if
father
dámaso
does
not
pardon
him
asked
captain
tiago
in
a
low
voice
then
maria
clara
will
see
that
father
dámaso
is
her
spiritual
father
but
i
believe
that
they
will
come
to
an
understanding
at
that
moment
steps
were
heard
and
ibarra
appeared
followed
by
aunt
isabel
his
presence
on
the
scene
produced
a
varied
effect
he
saluted
captain
tiago
affably
the
latter
not
knowing
whether
to
smile
or
to
weep
to
linares
he
bowed
profoundly
father
salví
arose
and
extended
his
hand
to
him
so
affectionately
that
ibarra
could
not
suppress
a
look
of
surprise
do
not
think
it
strange
said
father
salví
i
was
just
paying
you
a
compliment
ibarra
thanked
him
and
approached
sinang
where
have
you
been
all
day
she
asked
with
a
childish
laugh
we
have
been
asking
each
other
could
this
soul
redeemed
from
purgatory
have
gone
each
one
of
us
gave
a
different
answer
and
will
you
not
tell
what
you
said
no
that
is
a
secret
but
i
will
surely
tell
you
in
private
now
tell
us
where
you
have
been
so
that
we
can
see
who
has
been
able
to
guess
it
no
that
also
is
a
secret
but
i
will
tell
you
alone
if
the
señores
will
permit
certainly
certainly
said
father
salví
sinang
took
crisostomo
to
one
end
of
the
hall
she
was
very
happy
with
the
idea
of
knowing
a
secret
tell
me
my
little
friend
said
ibarra
is
maria
angry
with
me
i
do
not
know
but
she
says
that
it
is
better
that
you
should
forget
her
and
then
begins
to
cry
captain
tiago
wants
her
to
marry
that
gentleman
father
dámaso
also
wishes
it
but
she
says
neither
yes
nor
no
this
morning
when
we
were
asking
for
you
i
said
if
he
has
gone
to
make
love
to
some
one
else
she
replied
to
me
to
god
that
he
had
and
then
began
to
cry
ibarra
was
serious
tell
maria
that
i
want
to
speak
with
her
alone
alone
asked
sinang
knitting
her
eyebrows
and
looking
at
him
entirely
alone
no
but
so
that
we
may
not
be
seen
by
that
other
señor
it
is
difficult
but
do
worry
i
will
tell
her
and
when
will
i
know
the
answer
come
to
the
house
early
maria
never
wants
to
be
alone
we
keep
her
company
victoria
sleeps
by
her
side
one
night
and
i
the
next
night
it
is
my
turn
but
listen
what
is
the
secret
you
are
going
without
telling
me
the
principal
thing
that
is
true
i
was
in
the
town
of
los
baños
i
went
up
there
to
do
some
business
in
cocoanut
trees
since
i
am
thinking
of
building
a
factory
your
father
will
be
my
partner
nothing
more
than
that
give
us
the
secret
exclaimed
sinang
in
a
loud
voice
and
in
the
tone
of
a
defrauded
usurer
i
thought
take
care
i
do
want
you
to
tell

replied
sinang
sticking
up
her
nose
if
it

something
more
important
i
would
tell

my
friends

cocoanuts
cocoanuts
who
is
interested
in
cocoanuts
and
she
went
away
in
haste
to
find
her
girl
friends
a
few
moments
afterward
ibarra
seeing
that
the
conversation
was
lagging
took
leave
of
the
gathering
captain
tiago
expression
was
between
sweet
and
sour
linares
was
silent
and
observing
and
the
curate
feigning
to
be
joyful
was
telling
stories
none
of
the
girls
had
returned
chapter
xxxiii
playing
cards
with
the
shades
a
cloudy
sky
hides
the
moon
and
a
cold
wind
the
omen
of
approaching
december
whirls
the
dry
leaves
and
dust
in
the
narrow
path
leading
to
the
cemetery
under
the
gate
three
forms
are
conversing
in
a
low
tone
have
you
spoken
to
elias
asked
a
voice
no
you
know
he
is
very
odd
and
discreet
but
he
ought
to
be
with
us
don
crisostomo
saved
his
life
i
accepted
the
offer
for
the
same
reason
said
the
first
voice
don
crisostomo
is
having
my
wife
treated
at
a
doctor
house
in
manila
i
have
agreed
to
take
charge
of
the
convent
in
the
attack
so
that
i
can
settle
my
accounts
with
the
curate
and
we
we
will
have
charge
of
the
attack
on
the
cuartel
so
that
we
can
say
to
the
members
of
the
guardia
civil
that
our
father
had
sons
how
many
will
there
be
of
you
five
five

be
enough
don
crisostomo
servant
says
that
there
will
be
twenty
in
all
and
if
things
do
turn
out
well
st
said
one
and
they
all
became
silent
in
the
a
form
could
be
seen
crawling
along
the
fence
from
time
to
time
it
stopped
as
if
to
look
behind
and
it
did
so
not
without
reason
behind
at
some
twenty
paces
came
another
form
this
one
was
taller
and
seemed
to
be
darker
than
the
first
each
time
that
the
first
stopped
this
second
one
would
disappear
as
if
the
earth
had
swallowed
it
they
are
following
me
murmured
the
one
ahead
is
it
a
guardia
civil
has
the
sacristan
lied
it
appears
that
the
appointment
is
here
said
the
second
in
a
low
voice
they
are
up
to
something
bad
when
the
two
brothers
hide
it
from
me
the
first
form
finally
arrived
at
the
gate
of
the
cemetery
the
three
who
were
already
there
advanced
is
it
you
is
it
you
let
us
separate
some
one
is
following
me
we
will
have
the
arms
and
night
will
be
our
time
the
cry
is
don
crisostomo
begone
the
three
persons
disappeared
behind
the
wall
the
recent
arrival
hid
himself
in
the
hollow
of
the
gate
and
waited
silently
let
see
who
is
following
me
he
murmured
the
second
person
came
along
very
cautiously
and
stopped
to
look
around
i
have
arrived
late
said
he
in
a
half
intelligible
voice
but
perhaps
they
will
return
and
as
a
fine
rain
began
to
fall
and
threatened
to
continue
he
took
refuge
under
the
gate
naturally
he
met
the
other
ah
who
are
you
asked
the
one
who
had
just
come
up
in
a
manly
voice
and
who
are
you
replied
the
other
tranquilly
there
was
a
moment
pause
each
tried
to
recognize
the
other
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
and
to
distinguish
the
other
features
what
are
you
waiting
here
for
asked
the
one
with
the
heavy
voice
till
the
clock
strikes
eight
so
as
to
have
a
game
of
cards
with
the
dead
i
want
to
win
some
money
replied
the
other
in
an
ordinary
tone
and
you
what
do
you
come
here
for
a
a
for
the
same
thing
well
i
am
glad
so
i
will
not
be
without
a
companion
i
have
brought
some
cards
at
the
first
stroke
of
the
bell
i
put
down
the
albur
the
first
two
cards
put
on
the
board
in
monte
at
the
second
stroke
i
put
down
the
gallo
the
second
pair
the
cards
which
move
after
i
have
put
them
down
are
those
which
the
dead
choose
for
themselves
did
you
also
bring
some
cards
no
then
it
is
simple
just
as
you
act
as
for
them
so
i
hope
that
they
will
for
me
in
monte
the
banker
deals
the
cards
and
bets
that
one
of
the
cards
in
either
the
albur
or
gallo
is
turned
up
by
dealing
off
the
pack
before
the
card
chosen
by
the
other
person
is
turned
up
a
banker
can
play
against
two
others
and
if
the
shades
do
not
care
to
what
can
be
done
the
game
is
not
obligatory
upon
the
dead
there
was
a
moment
silence
did
you
come
armed
what
if
you
have
to
fight
with
the
shades
of
the
dead
i
use
my
fists
replied
the
taller
of
the
two
ah
the
devil
now
i
remember
the
dead
do
not
bet
when
there
is
more
than
one
live
person
around
there
are
two
of
us
is
that
true
well
i
do
want
to
go
away
nor
i
need
some
money
replied
the
smaller
one
but
let
us
do
this
we
will
decide
by
the
cards
which
one
shall
go
away
all
right
replied
the
other
showing
a
certain
amount
of
displeasure
then
let
us
go
in
have
you
any
matches
they
entered
the
cemetery
and
in
the
obscurity
they
searched
for
a
place
where
they
might
decide
the
question
with
the
cards
they
soon
found
a
niche
upon
which
they
sat
down
the
shorter
one
took
from
his
hat
some
playing
cards
and
the
other
lighted
a
match
each
one
looked
at
the
other
in
the
light
which
the
match
made
but
judging
from
the
expression
on
their
faces
they
did
not
recognize
each
other
however
we
can
recognize
in
the
taller
one
the
one
with
the
manly
voice
elias
and
in
the
smaller
one
lucas
with
the
scar
on
his
cheek
cut
the
cards
said
the
latter
without
ceasing
to
look
at
the
other
he
pushed
aside
some
bones
which
were
found
on
the
niche
and
turned
up
an
ace
and
a
jack
for
the
albur
elias
lighted
one
match
after
another
on
the
jack
said
he
and
in
order
to
show
which
of
the
cards
he
was
betting
on
he
placed
upon
it
a
piece
of
vertebræ
i
deal
said
lucas
and
after
turning
up
four
or
five
cards
an
ace
came
up
you
have
lost
he
added
now
leave
me
alone
so
that
i
may
win
some
money
elias
without
saying
a
word
disappeared
in
the
darkness
some
minutes
afterward
the
clock
in
the
church
struck
eight
and
the
bell
announced
the
hour
of
prayer
but
lucas
did
not
invite
anybody
to
play
with
him
he
did
not
call
out
the
shades
as
superstition
demanded
instead
he
uncovered
his
head
murmured
some
prayers
and
crossed
himself
with
the
same
fervor
as
the
chief
of
the
brotherhood
of
the
most
sacred
rosary
would
have
done
at
that
moment
the
drizzling
rain
continued
all
night
at
nine
the
streets
were
dark
and
lonely
the
little
cocoanut
oil
lanterns
which
each
citizen
had
to
hang
out
in
front
of
his
house
gave
light
scarcely
a
meter
around
it
seemed
as
though
they
had
been
lighted
so
one
might
see
the
darkness
two
civil
guards
were
walking
from
one
side
of
the
street
to
the
other
near
the
church
it
is
cold
said
one
in
tagalog
with
a
visayan
accent
we
catching
any
sacristans
there
is
nobody
to
clean
out
the
alferez
hen
yard
and
we
ought
to
catch
some
sacristan
and
make
him
do
it
since
that
one
was
killed
they
have
taken
warning
i
am
getting
tired
of
this
so
am
i
replied
the
other
nobody
commits
any
robbery
no
one
disturbs
the
peace
but
thank
god
they
say
that
elias
is
in
town
the
alferez
says
that
the
one
who
catches
him
will
be
free
from
whippings
for
three
months
ah

you
know
his
identification
marks

the
visayan
i
certainly
do

to
the
alferez
description

to
the
description

a
ah
he
will
not
escape
i
think
i
see
him
already
i
do
confuse
him
with
anybody
else
although
you
might
think
so
both
soldiers
continued
their
beats
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
two
forms
could
again
be
seen
one
following
the
other
cautiously
a
forcible
quien
vive
stops
them
both
the
first
one
replied
españa
in
a
trembling
voice
the
two
soldiers
drag
him
along
and
bring
him
up
to
the
light
to
recognize
him
it
was
lucas
but
the
soldiers
were
in
doubt
and
questioned
each
other
with
a
glance
the
alferez
said
nothing
about
his
having
a
scar
said
the
visayan
in
a
low
voice
where
are
you
going
to
order
a
mass
for
have
you
not
seen
elias
i
do
not
know
him
señor
replied
lucas
you
dunce
i
am
not
asking
if
you
know
him
nor
do
we
know
him
i
am
asking
you
if
you
have
seen
him
no
señor
listen
closely
i
will
give
you
his
description
stature
at
times
tall
at
times
regular

and
eyes
black

the
others

said
the
visayan
do

know
him
now
no
señor
replied
lucas
frightened
then
sulung
go
along
you
brute
you
ass
and
they
gave
him
a
shove
do
you
know
why
elias
is
tall
according
to
the
alferez
and
why
he
is
short
according
to
the
curate
asked
the
tagalog
of
the
other
no
because
the
alferez
was
stuck
in
a
mud
hole
when
he
observed
him
and
the
curate
was
on
foot
when
he
saw
him
that
right
exclaimed
the
visayan
you
are
bright
why
are
you
a
guardia
civil
i
have
been
always
i
was
a
smuggler
at
one
time
replied
the
tagalog
boastingly
but
another
form
attracted
their
attention
they
called
out
quien
vive
and
brought
him
up
to
the
light
this
time
it
was
elias
himself
where
are
you
going
i
am
pursuing
señor
a
man
who
has
whipped
and
threatened
my
brother
he
has
a
scar
on
his
face
and
his
name
is
elias
ha
exclaimed
the
two
and
looked
at
each
other
frightened
and
at
once
they
started
on
a
run
toward
the
church
where
a
few
minutes
before
lucas
had
disappeared
chapter
xxxiv
the
discovery
the
bell
announces
the
hour
of
evening
prayer
on
hearing
the
religious
sound
all
stop
leave
their
work
and
uncover
their
heads
the
laborer
coming
from
the
fields
on
the
carabao
back
suspends
the
song
to
which
the
animal
keeps
step
and
prays
the
women
in
the
middle
of
the
street
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
move
their
lips
with
affectation
so
that
no
one
may
doubt
their
devotion
the
man
stops
fondling
his
and
recites
the
angelus
so
that
he
may
have
good
luck
in
the
houses
they
pray
in
a
loud
voice
every
sound
which
is
not
a
part
of
the
ave
maria
is
dissipated
silenced
however
the
curate
without
his
hat
hastily
crosses
the
street
scandalizing
many
old
women
and
still
more
scandalous
he
directs
his
steps
towards
the
alferez
house
the
devout
women
think
that
it
is
time
for
them
to
stop
the
movement
of
their
lips
and
to
kiss
the
curate
hand
but
father
salví
takes
no
notice
of
them
he
finds
no
pleasure
in
placing
his
bony
hand
under
a
nose
some
important
business
must
be
occupying
him
that
he
should
so
forget
his
own
interests
and
those
of
the
church
he
goes
up
the
stairs
and
knocks
impatiently
at
the
alferez
door
the
latter
appears
his
eyebrows
knit
and
followed
by
his
better
half
who
smiles
malignantly
ah
father
curate
i
was
just
going
to
see
you
your
i
have
a
most
important
matter
i
ca
allow
your
goat
to
go
on
breaking
down
my
fence
shoot
him
if
he
gets
in
there
again
that
is
if
you
are
alive
said
the
curate
breathless
and
directing
himself
toward
the
sala
what
do
you
think
that
that
puppy
will
kill
me
kick
him
to
pieces
father
salví
stepped
back
and
looked
instinctively
at
the
feet
of
the
alferez
whom
are
you
talking
about
asked
he
trembling
of
whom
could
i
be
talking
but
that
big
blockhead
who
proposes
to
challenge
me
to
a
duel
with
revolvers
at
one
hundred
paces
ah
sighed
the
curate
and
added
i
have
come
to
speak
about
a
most
urgent
matter
which
seriously
concerns
the
life
of
all
of
us
seriously
repeated
the
alferez
turning
pale
in
turn
does
this
young
fellow
shoot
well
i
am
not
speaking
about
him
then
the
friar
pointed
to
the
door
which
the
alferez
shut
in
his
customary
manner
by
a
kick
the
alferez
usually
found
his
hands
superfluous
an
imprecation
and
a
groan
from
without
were
heard
you
brute
you
have
cut
open
my
head
cried
his
wife
now
unbosom
yourself
said
he
to
the
curate
in
a
quiet
manner
the
latter
looked
at
him
for
some
time
afterward
he
asked
in
that
nasal
and
monotonous
priest
voice
did
you
see
how
i
came
running
umph
i
thought
something
was
the
matter
with
you
when
i
leave
my
duties
in
this
manner
there
are
grave
motives
and
what
is
it
asked
the
other
stamping
his
foot
on
the
floor
calm
yourself
then
why
did
you
come
in
such
a
hurry
the
curate
approached
him
and
asked
in
a
mysterious
way
do
you
know
anything
new
the
alferez
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
confess
that
you
know
absolutely
nothing
what
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
about
elias
whom
your
sacristan
mayor
hid
last
night
he
asked
no
no
i
do
speak
of
such
matters
now
replied
the
curate
in
a
bad
humor
i
am
talking
about
a
great
danger
then
d
n
it
let
it
out
now
then
said
the
friar
slowly
and
with
a
certain
disdain
you
will
see
again
how
important
we
priests
are
the
lowest
layman
is
worth
a
regiment
so
that
a
curate
and
then
lowering
his
voice
in
a
very
mysterious
manner
i
have
discovered
a
great
conspiracy
the
alferez
started
and
looked
at
the
friar
astonished
a
terrible
and
conspiracy
which
is
to
break
out
this
very
night
this
very
night
exclaimed
the
alferez
moving
at
first
toward
father
salví
and
then
running
after
his
revolver
and
saber
which
were
hanging
on
the
wall
whom
shall
i
arrest
whom
shall
i
arrest
he
cried
be
calm
it
is
not
yet
time
thanks
to
my
great
haste
at
eight
i
shoot
them
all
listen
this
afternoon
a
woman
whose
name
i
must
not
mention
it
is
a
secret
of
the
confessional
came
to
me
and
disclosed
it
all
at
eight
they
will
take
the
cuartel
by
surprise
sack
the
convent
seize
the
government
steamboat
and
assassinate
all
the
spaniards
the
alferez
was
stupified
the
woman
has
not
told
more
than
that
added
the
curate
has
not
told
you
more
then
i
arrest
her
no
i
can
not
consent
to
it
the
tribunal
of
penitence
is
the
throne
of
god
of
forgiveness
neither
god
nor
forgiveness
count
in
this
matter
i
arrest
her
you
are
losing
your
head
what
you
ought
to
do
is
to
prepare
yourself
arm
your
soldiers
quietly
and
put
them
in
ambush
send
me
four
guards
for
the
convent
and
notify
the
people
on
the
government
steamboat
the
boat
is
not
here
i
send
to
other
sections
for
aid
they
would
notice
that
and
would
not
go
on
with
their
plans
no
do
do
that
what
is
important
is
that
we
catch
them
alive
and
make
them
talk
i
say
you
will
make
them
disclose
the
conspiracy
i
in
the
capacity
of
a
priest
ought
not
to
mix
myself
in
these
matters
your
chance
here
you
can
win
crosses
and
stars
i
ask
only
that
you
make
it
evident
that
i
am
the
one
who
warned
you
it
will
be
made
evident
father

will
be
made
evident
and
perhaps
a
mitre
will
fall
to
you
replied
the
radiant
alferez
be
sure
and
send
me
four
civil
guards
eh
be
discreet
at
eight
it
will
rain
stars
and
crosses
while
this
was
going
on
a
man
came
running
down
the
road
which
led
to
ibarra
house
and
quickly
went
up
the
stairs
is
the
señor
at
home
asked
elias
of
the
servant
he
is
in
his
laboratory
at
work
ibarra
in
order
to
pass
the
time
while
he
impatiently
waited
for
the
hour
when
he
could
make
explanations
to
maria
clara
had
gone
to
work
in
his
cabinet
ah
is
it
you
elias
he
exclaimed
i
was
thinking
about
you
yesterday
i
forgot
to
ask
you
for
the
name
of
that
spaniard
in
whose
house
your
grandfather
lived
do
bother
yourself
señor
about
me
look
continued
ibarra
without
noting
the
agitation
of
the
young
man
and
putting
a
piece
of
bamboo
to
a
flame
i
have
made
a
great
discovery
this
bamboo
is
incombustible
do
talk
about
bamboo
now
señor
talk
about
collecting
your
papers
and
fleeing
in
a
minute
ibarra
looked
at
him
surprised
and
on
seeing
the
seriousness
in
elias
countenance
he
dropped
the
object
which
he
had
in
his
hands
burn
everything
that
can
possibly
implicate
you
in
any
way
and
put
yourself
in
a
more
secure
place
within
an
hour
and
what
for
he
asked
at
last
put
all
that
you
have
of
value
in
a
secure
place
and
what
for
burn
all
papers
written
by
you
or
to
you
the
most
innocent
can
be
interpreted
in
a
bad
sense
but
what
for
what
for
because
i
have
just
discovered
a
conspiracy
which
will
be
attributed
to
you
in
order
to
ruin
you
a
conspiracy
and
who
has
planned
it
i
have
been
unable
to
learn
the
author
of
it
only
a
moment
ago
i
was
talking
with
one
of
the
unfortunate
men
who
have
been
paid
for
it
i
could
not
dissuade
him
and
did
that
fellow
say
who
paid
him
yes
asking
me
to
keep
the
secret
he
told
me
that
it
was
you
my
god
exclaimed
ibarra
he
stood
stupefied
señor
do
hesitate
do
doubt
do
lose
time
for
undoubtedly
the
conspiracy
will
break
out
this
very
night
ibarra
with
staring
eyes
and
hands
holding
his
head
seemed
not
to
hear
him
the
blow
can
not
be
thwarted
continued
elias
i
have
arrived
too
late
i
do
not
know
their
leaders
save
yourself
señor
save
yourself
for
the
sake
of
your
country
where
shall
i
flee
they
are
expecting
me
this
evening
exclaimed
ibarra
thinking
of
maria
clara
to
any
other
town
to
manila
to
the
house
of
some
official
only
flee
somewhere
so
that
they
will
not
say
that
you
are
directing
the
movement
and
if
i
myself
denounce
the
conspiracy
you
denounce
it
exclaimed
elias
looking
at
him
and
stepping
back
you
would
pass
for
a
traitor
and
a
coward
in
the
eyes
of
the
conspirators
and
for
a
pusillanimous
person
in
the
eyes
of
others
they
would
say
that
you
had
played
a
trick
to
win
some
praise
they
would
say
but
what
can
be
done
already
i
have
told
you
destroy
all
the
papers
you
have
which
relate
to
you
flee
and
await
developments
and
maria
clara
exclaimed
the
young
man
no
death
first
elias
wrung
his
hands
and
said
well
then
at
least
avoid
the
blow
prepare
yourself
against
their
accusations
ibarra
looked
around
him
in
a
stupefied
manner
then
help
me
there
in
those
bags
i
have
my
family
letters
sort
out
those
from
my
father
which
are
perhaps
the
ones
that
would
incriminate
me
read
the
signatures
ibarra
stunned
and
overwhelmed
opened
and
closed
drawers
collected
papers
hastily
read
letters
tore
up
some
kept
others
took
down
books
and
thumbed
through
some
of
them
elias
did
the
same
if
indeed
with
less
confusion
with
equal
zeal
but
he
stopped
with
eyes
wide
open
turned
over
a
paper
which
he
had
in
his
hand
and
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
did
your
family
know
don
pedro
eibarramendia
certainly
replied
ibarra
opening
a
drawer
and
taking
out
a
pile
of
papers
he
was
my
your
great
grandfather
don
pedro
eibarramendia
he
again
asked
with
livid
features
and
a
changed
appearance
yes
replied
ibarra
distracted
we
cut
short
the
name
for
it
was
too
long
he
was
a
basque
said
elias
approaching
him
yes
but
what
the
matter
he
asked
surprised
elias
closed
his
fist
shook
it
in
ibarra
face
and
looked
at
him
crisostomo
stepped
back
as
soon
as
he
read
the
expression
on
that
face
do
you
know
who
don
pedro
eibarramendia
was
he
asked
between
his
teeth
don
pedro
eibarramendia
was
that
wretch
who
accused
my
grandfather
and
caused
all
our
misery
i
was
looking
for
one
of
his
name
god
has
given
you
into
my
hands
account
to
me
for
our
misfortunes
ibarra
looked
at
him
terrified
elias
shook
him
by
the
arm
and
in
a
bitter
voice
filled
with
hate
said
look
at
me
well
see
if
i
have
suffered
and
you
you
live
you
love
you
have
fortune
home
consideration
you
live
you
live
and
beside
himself
he
ran
toward
a
small
collection
of
arms
but
he
had
scarcely
grasped
two
swords
when
he
let
them
fall
and
like
a
madman
looked
at
ibarra
who
remained
immovable
what
am
i
to
do
he
said
and
fled
from
the
house
chapter
xxxv
the
catastrophe
there
in
the
captain
tiago
linares
and
aunt
isabel
were
eating
supper
in
the
sala
the
rattling
of
plate
and
tableware
was
heard
maria
clara
had
said
that
she
did
not
care
to
eat
and
had
seated
herself
at
the
piano
by
her
side
was
jolly
sinang
who
murmured
little
secrets
in
maria
ear
while
father
salví
uneasily
paced
the
sala
it
was
not
because
the
convalescent
had
no
appetite
that
she
was
not
eating
it
was
because
she
was
awaiting
the
arrival
of
a
certain
person
and
had
taken
advantage
of
the
moment
in
which
her
argus
could
not
be
present
the
hour
when
linares
ate
you
will
see
how
that
ghost
will
stay
till
eight
murmured
sinang
pointing
to
the
curate
at
eight
he
ought
to
come
this
priest
is
as
much
in
love
as
linares
maria
clara
looked
at
her
friend
frightened
the
latter
without
noticing
her
expression
continued
her
terrible
gossip
ah
now
i
know
why
he
does
go
in
spite
of
all
my
hints
he
does
want
to
burn
the
lamps
in
the
convent
do
you
see
ever
since
you
fell
ill
he
has
had
the
two
lights
which
he
used
to
burn
put
out
but
look
at
his
eyes
and
his
face
just
at
that
moment
the
clock
in
the
house
struck
eight
the
curate
trembled
and
went
and
sat
down
in
a
corner
of
the
room
he
is
coming
said
sinang
pinching
maria
clara
do
you
hear
the
bell
in
the
church
tolled
eight
and
all
arose
to
pray
father
salví
with
a
weak
and
trembling
voice
led
but
as
each
one
had
his
own
thoughts
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
him
the
prayer
had
scarcely
ended
when
ibarra
presented
himself
the
young
man
was
wearing
mourning
not
only
in
his
dress
but
in
his
face
in
fact
it
was
so
evident
that
maria
clara
on
seeing
him
arose
and
took
a
step
toward
him
as
if
to
ask
what
ailed
him
but
at
the
same
instant
a
discharge
of
musketry
was
heard
ibarra
stopped
his
eyes
rolled
and
he
was
unable
to
speak
the
curate
hid
himself
behind
a
pillar
more
shooting
and
more
noise
was
heard
in
the
direction
of
the
convent
followed
by
cries
and
the
sound
of
people
running
captain
tiago
aunt
isabel
and
linares
entered
the
room
hurriedly
crying
tulisan
tulisan
andeng
followed
them
brandishing
a
spit
and
ran
toward
her
foster
sister
aunt
isabel
fell
on
her
knees
and
prayed
the
kyrie
eleison
captain
tiago
pale
and
trembling
carried
a
chicken
liver
on
his
fork
and
in
tears
offered
it
to
the
virgin
of
antipolo
linares
had
his
mouth
full
and
was
armed
with
a
spoon
sinang
and
maria
clara
embraced
each
other
the
only
person
who
did
not
move
was
ibarra
he
stood
as
if
petrified
his
face
indescribably
pale
the
cries
and
blows
continued
the
windows
were
shut
with
a
bang
a
whistle
was
heard
and
occasionally
a
shot
christe
eleison
santiago
fasten
the
windows
groaned
aunt
isabel
fifty
great
bombs
and
a
thanksgiving
mass
replied
captain
tiago
ora
pro
nobis
after
a
time
things
quieted
down
and
there
was
a
terrible
silence
the
voice
of
the
alferez
was
distinguished
as
he
came
running
in
and
crying
father
curate
father
salví
come
misere
the
alferez
is
asking
for
confession
cried
aunt
isabel
is
he
wounded
asked
linares
at
last
ah
come
father
salví
there
is
nothing
to
fear
now
continued
the
alferez
shouting
father
salví
pale
and
decided
at
last
came
out
of
his
and
went
downstairs
the
tulisanes
have
killed
the
alferez
said
aunt
isabel
maria
clara
sinang
go
to
your
room
fasten
the
door
kyrie
eleison
ibarra
also
went
toward
the
stairs
in
spite
of
aunt
isabel
who
was
saying
do
go
out
you
have
confessed
yet
do
go
out
the
good
old
woman
had
been
a
great
friend
of
ibarra
mother
but
ibarra
left
the
house
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
about
him
was
revolving
through
the
air
that
even
the
ground
was
gone
from
under
his
feet
his
ears
buzzed
his
legs
moved
heavily
and
irregularly
waves
of
blood
light
and
darkness
succeeded
one
another
on
the
retina
of
his
eye
despite
the
fact
that
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
in
the
heavens
the
young
man
stumbled
on
every
stone
in
the
solitary
and
deserted
street
near
the
cuartel
he
saw
some
soldiers
with
their
bayonets
fixed
talking
excitedly
he
passed
by
unseen
in
the
tribunal
blows
cries
wails
and
curses
were
heard
the
alferez
voice
drowned
all
the
others
put
him
in
the
stocks
put
handcuffs
on
that
fellow
two
shots
for
whoever
moves
sergeant
you
will
mount
your
guard
let
no
one
pass
not
even
god
corporal
let
no
one
sleep
ibarra
hastened
his
steps
toward
his
house
his
servants
were
uneasily
awaiting
him
saddle
the
best
horse
and
go
to
bed
said
he
to
them
he
entered
his
laboratory
and
hurriedly
began
to
get
his
travelling
bag
ready
he
opened
an
iron
box
took
out
all
the
money
which
he
found
there
and
put
it
in
a
bag
he
gathered
his
jewels
together
took
down
a
picture
of
maria
clara
which
was
hanging
upon
the
wall
and
arming
himself
with
a
dirk
and
two
revolvers
he
turned
to
the
cupboard
where
he
had
some
tools
at
that
instant
three
blows
loud
and
strong
sounded
on
the
door
who
there
asked
ibarra
in
a
doleful
voice
open
in
the
name
of
the
king
open
the
door
at
once
or
we
will
knock
it
down
replied
an
imperious
spanish
voice
ibarra
looked
toward
the
window
his
eyes
flashed
and
he
cocked
his
revolver
but
changing
his
mind
he
left
the
arms
and
went
to
open
the
door
at
the
same
moment
that
the
servants
came
up
three
guards
seized
him
instantly
you
are
made
a
prisoner
in
the
name
of
the
king
said
the
sergeant
what
for
they
will
tell
you
later
we
are
prohibited
from
saying
a
word
the
young
man
reflected
a
moment
and
not
wishing
perhaps
the
soldiers
to
discover
his
preparations
for
flight
he
took
his
hat
and
said
i
am
at
your
disposal
i
suppose
it
will
be
only
for
a
short
time
if
you
promise
not
to
escape
we
will
not
handcuff
you
the
alferez
grants
this
favor
but
if
you
flee
ibarra
followed
leaving
the
servants
in
consternation
in
the
meantime
what
had
become
of
elias
on
leaving
crisostomo
house
like
a
madman
he
ran
about
without
knowing
where
he
crossed
fields
and
in
violent
agitation
arrived
at
a
forest
he
was
fleeing
from
people
and
from
light
the
moon
troubled
him
and
he
entered
the
mysterious
shade
of
the
forest
sometimes
stopping
sometimes
following
unbroken
paths
leaning
upon
trunks
entangled
in
the
briars
he
looked
toward
the
town
which
lay
at
his
feet
bathed
in
the
light
of
the
moon
stretching
itself
out
on
the
plain
lying
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
birds
disturbed
in
their
sleep
flew
away
owls
screeched
and
flew
from
one
limb
to
another
but
elias
neither
heard
nor
saw
them
he
thought
he
was
being
followed
by
the
infuriated
shades
of
his
ancestors
he
saw
the
horrible
basket
hanging
from
every
branch
with
the
head
of
bálat
just
as
his
father
had
described
it
to
him
he
thought
he
saw
the
dead
body
of
his
grandmother
lying
at
the
foot
of
every
tree
he
seemed
to
see
the
skeleton
of
his
dishonored
grandfather
in
the
darkness
and
the
skeleton
the
old
woman
and
the
head
all
cried
out
to
him
coward
coward
he
left
the
mountain
and
fled
down
toward
the
sea
he
ran
along
the
beach
in
agitation
but
there
in
the
distance
amid
the
waves
where
the
light
of
the
moon
seemed
to
raise
a
fog
he
thought
he
saw
a
shade
raise
itself
the
shade
of
his
sister
with
her
breast
covered
with
blood
her
hair
hanging
loose
in
the
air
elias
fell
upon
his
knees
on
the
sand
and
you
too
he
cried
stretching
out
his
arms
then
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
fog
he
arose
slowly
and
advancing
toward
it
went
into
the
water
as
if
to
follow
somebody
he
waded
on
over
the
gentle
slope
of
the
beach
which
forms
the
bar
he
was
already
far
from
the
shore
and
the
water
was
up
to
his
belt
he
went
on
and
on
as
if
fascinated
by
a
seducing
spirit
the
water
was
now
up
to
his
breast
suddenly
the
discharge
of
musketry
awoke
him
from
his
dream
the
vision
disappeared
and
the
young
man
returned
to
reality
he
stopped
reflected
and
noticed
that
he
was
in
the
water
the
lake
was
smooth
and
he
could
still
see
the
lights
in
the
fishermen
huts
he
returned
to
the
shore
and
made
his
way
toward
the
town
what
for
he
himself
did
not
know
the
town
seemed
uninhabited
the
houses
were
all
closed
even
the
animals
the
dogs
which
are
accustomed
to
bark
at
night
had
hid
themselves
through
fear
the
silvery
light
of
the
moon
increased
the
sadness
and
solitude
afraid
of
meeting
the
civil
guards
he
went
through
the
orchards
and
gardens
in
one
of
the
gardens
he
thought
he
saw
two
human
forms
but
he
continued
his
way
jumping
over
fences
and
walls
he
arrived
after
great
labor
at
the
other
side
of
the
town
and
directed
his
steps
toward
ibarra
house
the
servants
were
in
the
door
lamenting
and
commenting
on
the
arrest
of
their
master
aware
of
what
had
passed
elias
went
away
but
returned
to
the
house
leaped
over
the
wall
crawled
through
a
window
and
went
into
the
cabinet
or
laboratory
where
the
candle
which
ibarra
had
left
was
still
burning
elias
saw
the
papers
and
the
books
he
found
the
arms
and
the
little
sacks
which
contained
the
money
and
the
jewelry
all
that
had
passed
ran
through
his
imagination
again
and
seeing
all
the
papers
which
might
incriminate
ibarra
he
thought
of
collecting
them
throwing
them
through
the
window
and
burying
them
he
glanced
toward
the
garden
and
by
the
light
of
the
moon
he
saw
two
civil
guards
coming
with
an
adjutant
their
bayonets
and
helmets
were
glistening
in
the
light
then
he
decided
he
piled
up
the
clothes
and
papers
in
the
middle
of
the
cabinet
emptied
the
oil
in
a
lamp
upon
the
pile
and
set
fire
to
it
he
quickly
buckled
the
arms
around
him
he
saw
the

hesitated
put
it
in
one
of
the
little
sacks
and
jumped
out
of
the
window
with
them
all
it
was
already
time
for
the
two
civil
guards
were
forcing
their
entrance
let
us
go
up
to
get
your
master
papers
said
the
adjutant
have
you
permission
if
not
you
shall
not
go
up
said
an
old
servant
but
the
soldiers
pushed
the
servants
aside
with
the
butts
of
their
guns
and
went
upstairs
a
thick
smoke
was
already
filling
the
whole
house
and
gigantic
tongues
of
flame
were
coming
out
from
the
sala
licking
the
doors
and
windows
fire
fire
fire
they
all
cried
each
hurried
to
save
what
he
could
but
the
fire
had
filled
the
small
laboratory
breaking
out
furiously
among
the
inflammable
materials
the
civil
guards
had
to
turn
back
the
fire
roaring
and
sweeping
all
before
it
closed
the
passage
to
them
in
vain
they
brought
water
from
the
well
all
were
shouting
and
crying
for
help
but
they
were
isolated
the
fire
reached
the
other
rooms
and
in
thick
columns
of
smoke
ascended
to
the
heavens
some
peasants
came
from
a
distance
but
they
arrived
only
in
time
to
see
the
frightful
spectacle
the
end
of
that
old
building
so
long
respected
by
the
elements
chapter
xxxvi
what
people
say
and
think
day
dawned
at
last
for
the
terrorized
people
the
streets
in
which
the
cuartel
and
the
tribunal
were
situated
were
still
deserted
and
solitary
the
houses
showed
no
signs
of
life
however
a
shutter
was
opened
with
a
creaking
noise
and
an
infant
head
stuck
out
and
looked
in
all
directions
slap
a
sound
announces
hard
contact
between
a
strip
of
leather
and
a
human
body
the
child
made
a
grimace
closed
its
eyes
and
disappeared
the
shutter
was
closed
again
the
example
had
been
set
without
any
doubt
the
opening
and
closing
of
the
shutter
has
been
heard
for
another
window
was
opened
very
slowly
and
cautiously
and
a
wrinkled
and
toothless
old
woman
thrust
out
her
head
she
was
called
sister
ruté
she
looked
about
knit
her
brows
spit
noisily
and
then
crossed
herself
in
the
house
opposite
a
little
window
was
timidly
opened
and
her
friend
sister
rufa
appeared
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
smiled
made
some
signals
and
again
crossed
themselves
jesús
it
was
like
a
thanksgiving
mass
said
sister
rufa
since
the
time
that
bálat
sacked
the
town
i
have
never
seen
a
night
like
it
replied
sister
puté
what
a
lot
of
shots
they
say
that
it
was
old
pablo
gang
tulisanes
it
could
be
they
say
that
it
was
the
cuaderilleros
against
the
civil
guards
for
this
reason
they
have
arrested
don
filipo
sanctus
deus
they
say
that
there
are
no
less
than
fourteen
killed
other
windows
were
opened
and
different
faces
appeared
exchanging
salutations
and
commenting
on
the
affair
in
the
light
of
the
day
which
promised
to
be
a
splendid
one
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
like
shadows
soldiers
hurrying
about
in
confusion
there
goes
another
corpse
said
some
one
from
one
of
the
windows
one
i
see
two
and
so
do
i
but
do
you
know
what
it
was
asked
a
man
with
a
crafty
face
certainly
the
cuaderilleros
no
señor
an
uprising
at
the
cuartel
what
uprising
the
curate
against
the
alferez
no
nothing
of
the
sort
said
he
who
had
asked
the
question
the
chinese
have
risen
in
revolt
and
he
closed
his
window
again
the
chinese
repeated
all
with
the
greatest
astonishment
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
other
versions
of
the
affair
were
in
circulation
ibarra
with
his
servants
it
was
said
had
tried
to
steal
maria
clara
and
captain
tiago
aided
by
the
guardia
civil
had
defended
her
by
this
time
the
number
of
the
dead
was
no
longer
fourteen
but
thirty
captain
tiago
it
was
said
was
wounded
and
was
going
right
off
to
manila
with
his
family
the
arrival
of
two
cuaderilleros
carrying
a
human
form
in
a
wheelbarrow
and
followed
by
a
civil
guard
produced
a
great
sensation
it
was
supposed
that
they
came
from
the
convent
from
the
form
of
the
feet
which
were
hanging
down
they
tried
to
guess
who
it
could
be
by
seven
when
other
civil
guards
arrived
from
neighboring
towns
the
current
version
of
the
affair
was
already
clear
and
detailed
i
have
just
come
from
the
tribunal
where
i
have
seen
don
filipo
and
don
crisostomo
prisoners
said
a
man
to
sister
puté
i
talked
with
one
of
the
cuaderilleros
on
guard
well
bruno
the
son
of
the
man
who
was
whipped
to
death
made
a
declaration
last
night
as
you
know
captain
tiago
is
going
to
marry
his
daughter
to
a
spaniard
don
crisostomo
offended
wanted
to
take
revenge
and
tried
to
kill
all
the
spaniards
even
the
curate
last
night
they
attacked
the
convent
and
the
cuartel
happily
by
mercy
of
god
the
curate
was
in
captain
tiago
house
they
say
that
many
escaped
the
civil
guards
burned
don
crisostomo
house
and
if
they
had
not
taken
him
prisoner
they
would
have
burned
him
too
they
burned
the
house
all
the
servants
were
arrested
why
you
can
still
see
the
smoke
from
here
said
the
narrator
approaching
the
window
those
who
come
from
there
relate
very
sad
things
all
looked
toward
the
place
indicated
a
light
column
of
smoke
was
still
ascending
to
the
heavens
all
made
comments
more
or
less
pious
more
or
less
accusatory
poor
young
man
exclaimed
an
old
man
the
husband
of
puté
yes
replied
his
wife
but
he
did
not
order
a
mass
for
the
soul
of
his
father
who
undoubtedly
needs
it
more
than
others
but
wife
you
do
have
any
pity
sympathy
for
the
excommunicated
it
is
a
sin
to
have
pity
for
the
enemies
of
god
say
the
curates
do
you
remember
he
ran
over
the
sacred
burial
ground
as
if
he
were
in
a
cattle
pen
but
a
cattle
pen
and
a
cemetery
are
much
alike
responded
the
old
man
except
that
but
one
class
of
animals
enter
the
cemetery
what
cried
sister
puté
are
you
still
going
to
defend
him
whom
god
so
clearly
punishes
you
will
see
that
they
will
arrest
you
too
you
may
support
a
falling
house
if
you
want
to
the
husband
became
silent
in
view
of
this
argument
yes
continued
the
old
woman
after
striking
father
dámaso
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
kill
father
salví
but
you
ca
deny
that
he
was
a
good
boy
when
he
was
a
child
yes
he
was
a
good
child
replied
the
old
woman
but
he
went
to
spain
all
those
who
go
to
spain
return
heretics
so
the
curates
say
oh
exclaimed
the
husband
seeing
his
revenge
and
the
curate
and
all
the
curates
and
the
archbishops
and
the
pope
and
the
virgin
are
they
not
spaniards
bah
are
they
heretics
too
bah
happily
for
sister
puté
the
arrival
of
a
servant
who
rushed
in
confused
and
pale
cut
off
the
discussion
a
man
hanged
in
a
neighboring
orchard
she
exclaimed
breathless
a
man
hanged
exclaimed
all
full
of
amazement
the
women
crossed
themselves
no
one
could
stir
yes
señor
continued
the
servant
trembling
i
was
going
to
gather
some
peas
in
i
looked
into
the
orchard
next
door
to
see
if
there
i
saw
a
man
swinging
i
thought
it
was
teo
i
went
nearer
to
gather
peas
and
i
saw
that
it
was
not
he
but
it
was
another
and
was
dead
i
ran
ran
and
let
us
go
and
see
it
said
the
old
man
rising
take
us
there
do
go
cried
sister
puté
seizing
him
by
the
shirt
you
get
into
trouble
he
has
hanged
himself
then
all
the
worse
for
him
let
me
see
it
wife
go
to
the
tribunal
juan
and
report
it
perhaps
he
is
not
dead
yet
and
he
went
ino
typo
should
be
into
the
orchard
followed
by
the
servant
who
kept
hid
behind
him
the
women
and
sister
puté
herself
came
along
behind
full
of
terror
and
curiosity
there
it
is
señor
said
the
servant
stopping
him
and
pointing
with
her
finger
the
group
stopped
at
a
respectful
distance
allowing
the
old
man
to
advance
alone
the
body
of
a
man
hanging
from
the
limb
of
a
santol
tree
was
swinging
slowly
in
the
breeze
the
old
man
contemplated
it
for
some
time
he
looked
at
the
rigid
feet
the
arms
the
stained
clothing
and
the
drooping
head
we
ought
not
to
touch
the
corpse
until
some
official
has
arrived
said
he
in
a
loud
voice
he
is
already
stiff
he
has
been
dead
for
some
time
the
women
approached
hesitatingly
it
is
the
neighbor
who
lived
in
that
little
house
the
one
who
arrived
only
two
weeks
ago
look
at
the
scar
on
his
face
ave
maria
exclaimed
some
of
the
women
shall
we
pray
for
his
soul
asked
a
young
girl
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
looking
at
the
dead
body
from
all
directions
you
fool
you
heretic
sister
puté
scolded
her
do
you
know
what
father
dámaso
said
to
pray
for
a
damned
person
is
to
tempt
god
he
who
commits
suicide
is
irrevocably
condemned
for
this
reason
he
can
not
be
buried
in
a
sacred
place
i
had
begun
to
think
that
this
man
was
going
to
have
a
bad
ending
i
never
could
guess
what
he
lived
on
i
saw
him
twice
speaking
with
the
sacristan
mayor
observed
a
girl
it
could
have
been
to
confess
himself
or
to
order
a
mass
the
neighbors
gathered
together
and
a
large
circle
surrounded
the
corpse
which
was
still
swinging
in
half
an
hour
some
officers
and
two
cuaderilleros
arrived
they
took
the
body
down
and
put
it
in
a
wheelbarrow
some
people
are
in
a
hurry
to
die
said
one
of
the
officers
laughing
while
he
took
out
the
pen
from
behind
his
ear
he
asked
some
trifling
questions
took
the
declaration
of
the
servant
whom
he
tried
to
implicate
now
looking
at
her
with
evil
in
his
eyes
now
threatening
her
and
now
attributing
to
her
words
which
she
did
not
say
so
much
so
that
the
servant
believing
that
she
was
going
to
be
taken
to
jail
began
to
weep
and
finished
by
declaring
that
she
was
looking
for
peas
but
that
and
she
called
teo
to
witness
in
the
meantime
a
peasant
with
a
wide
hat
and
a
large
plaster
on
his
neck
was
examining
the
body
and
the
rope
by
which
it
was
hanging
the
face
was
no
more
livid
than
the
rest
of
the
body
above
the
rope
could
be
seen
two
scars
and
two
small
bruises
where
the
rope
had
rubbed
there
was
no
blood
and
the
skin
was
white
the
curious
peasant
examined
closely
the
camisa
and
the
pantaloons
he
noted
that
they
were
full
of
dust
and
recently
torn
in
some
places
but
what
most
attracted
his
attention
were
the
on
his
clothing
even
up
to
his
neck
what
do
you
see
asked
the
officer
i
was
trying
to
identify
him
señor
stammered
the
peasant
lowering
his
hat
further
from
his
uncovered
head
but
have
you
heard
that
it
was
one
lucas
were
you
sleeping
all
began
to
laugh
the
peasant
embarrassed
muttered
a
few
words
and
went
away
with
head
down
walking
slowly
here
where
are
you
going
cried
the
old
man
you
ca
get
out
that
way
that
the
way
to
the
dead
man
house
that
fellow
is
still
asleep
said
the
officer
with
a
jeer
have
to
throw
some
water
on
him
those
standing
around
laughed
again
the
peasant
left
the
place
where
he
had
played
so
poor
a
part
and
directed
his
steps
toward
the
church
in
the
sacristy
he
asked
for
the
sacristan
mayor
he
is
still
sleeping
they
replied
gruffly
do
you
know
that
they
sacked
the
convent
last
night
i
will
wait
till
he
awakes
the
sacristans
looked
at
him
with
that
rudeness
characteristic
of
people
who
are
in
the
habit
of
being
in
a
dark
corner
the
sacristan
mayor
was
sleeping
in
a
large
chair
his
spectacles
were
across
his
forehead
among
his
long
locks
of
hair
his
squalid
bony
breast
was
bare
and
rose
and
fell
with
regularity
the
peasant
sat
down
near
by
disposed
to
wait
patiently
but
a
coin
fell
on
the
floor
and
he
began
looking
for
it
with
the
aid
of
a
candle
under
the
sacristan
mayor
big
chair
the
peasant
also
noted
on
the
sleeping
man
pantaloons
and
on
the
arms
of
his
camisa
the
sacristan
awoke
at
last
rubbed
his
good
eye
and
in
a
very
bad
humor
reproached
the
man
i
would
like
to
order
a
mass
said
señor
replied
he
in
a
tone
of
excuse
they
have
already
finished
all
the
masses
said
the
man
softening
his
accent
a
little
if
you
want
it
for
is
it
for
souls
in
purgatory
no
señor
replied
the
peasant
giving
him
a
peso
and
looking
fixedly
in
his
one
eye
he
added
it
is
for
a
person
who
is
going
to
die
soon
and
he
left
the
sacristy
i
could
have
seized
him
last
night
he
added
sighingly
as
he
removed
the
plaster
from
his
neck
and
he
straightened
up
and
regained
the
stature
and
appearance
of
elias
chapter
xxxvii
vae
victis
civil
guards
were
passing
with
a
sinister
air
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
door
of
the
tribunal
threatening
with
the
butts
of
their
guns
the
daring
boys
who
stood
on
or
raised
each
other
up
in
order
to
look
through
the
grates
in
the
windows
the
sala
did
not
present
that
same
joyful
aspect
as
it
did
when
the
program
for
the
festival
was
being
discussed
it
was
gloomy
and
the
silence
was
almost
the
civil
guards
and
the
cuaderilleros
who
were
occupying
the
room
scarcely
spoke
and
the
few
words
that
they
did
pronounce
were
in
a
low
tone
around
the
table
sat
the
directorcillo
two
writers
and
some
soldiers
scribbling
papers
the
alferez
walked
from
one
side
to
the
other
looking
from
time
to
time
ferociously
toward
the
door
themistocles
after
the
battle
of
salamis
could
not
have
shown
more
pride
at
the
olympic
games
doña
consolacion
yawned
in
one
corner
of
the
room
and
disclosed
her
black
palate
and
her
crooked
teeth
her
cold
and
evil
look
was
fixed
on
the
door
of
the
jail
covered
with
indecent
pictures
her
husband
made
amiable
by
the
victory
had
yielded
to
her
request
to
be
allowed
to
witness
the
interrogation
and
perhaps
the
tortures
which
were
to
follow
the
hyena
smelled
the
dead
body
she
licked
her
chops
and
was
wearied
at
the
delay
in
the
punishment
the
gobernadorcillo
chair
that
large
chair
under
the
portrait
of
his
majesty
was
empty
and
seemed
destined
for
some
other
person
at
nearly
nine
the
curate
pale
and
with
eyebrows
knit
arrived
well
you
have
made
any
one
wait
said
the
alferez
sarcastically
to
the
friar
i
would
have
preferred
not
to
be
present
replied
father
salví
in
a
low
voice
without
taking
notice
of
the
bitter
tone
i
am
very
nervous
as
no
one
came
i
decided
that
in
order
not
to
leave
the
chair
empty
your
presence
you
already
know
that
the
prisoners
are
to
leave
town
this
afternoon
young
ibarra
and
the
teniente
mayor
the
alferez
pointed
toward
the
jail
eight
are
in
there
said
he
bruno
died
last
night
at
midnight
but
his
declaration
has
been
obtained
the
curate
saluted
doña
consolacion
who
responded
with
a
yawn
and
an
aah
the
friar
took
the
big
chair
under
the
picture
of
his
majesty
we
can
begin
said
he
bring
out
the
two
who
are
in
the
stocks
ordered
the
alferez
in
his
most
terrifying
voice
and
turning
to
the
curate
he
added
changing
his
tone
they
are
fastened
in
the
stocks
with
two
holes
vacant
for
those
who
are
interested
in
instruments
of
torture
we
will
say
that
the
stocks
is
one
of
the
most
innocent
the
holes
in
which
are
fastened
the
legs
of
the
prisoner
are
a
little
more
or
less
than
a
palm
apart
leaving
two
holes
vacant
and
putting
the
legs
in
the
holes
on
either
side
would
make
the
position
strained
so
that
the
ankles
would
suffer
peculiarly
and
the
lower
extremities
be
stretched
apart
more
than
a
yard
it
does
not
kill
instantly
as
may
well
be
imagined
the
turnkey
followed
by
four
soldiers
drew
back
the
bolt
and
opened
the
door
a
nauseating
odor
and
the
thick
damp
air
escaped
from
the
dense
darkness
of
the
prison
and
at
the
same
time
groans
and
sighs
were
heard
a
soldier
lighted
a
match
but
the
flame
was
extinguished
in
that
foul
vitiated
atmosphere
and
they
had
to
wait
till
the
air
was
renewed
in
the
vague
light
of
a
candle
several
human
forms
could
be
discerned
they
were
men
some
of
whom
locked
their
arms
around
their
knees
and
hid
their
heads
between
them
others
were
lying
down
with
their
mouths
to
the
ground
some
standing
and
some
leaning
against
the
wall
a
blow
and
a
creaking
sound
was
heard
accompanied
by
oaths
the
stocks
were
being
opened
doña
consolacion
body
was
bent
forward
the
muscles
of
her
neck
were
rigid
her
eyes
riveted
to
the
half
open
door
between
the
soldiers
came
out
tarsilo
the
brother
of
bruno
he
wore
handcuffs
his
torn
clothes
disclosed
muscles
his
eyes
were
fixed
insolently
on
the
alferez
wife
this
is
the
one
who
defended
himself
most
bravely
and
who
ordered
his
companions
to
flee
said
the
alferez
to
father
salví
behind
came
another
miserable
sight
a
man
crying
and
weeping
like
a
child
he
was
limping
and
his
pantaloons
were
stained
with
blood
mercy
señor
have
mercy
i
will
not
enter
the
cuartel
yard
again
he
cried
he
is
a
crafty
fellow
said
the
alferez
speaking
to
the
curate
he
wanted
to
flee
but
had
received
a
flesh
wound
what
is
your
name
asked
the
alferez
speaking
to
tarsilo
tarsilo
alasigan
what
did
don
crisostomo
promise
you
for
attacking
the
cuartel
don
crisostomo
has
never
communicated
with
us
do
deny
it
you
wanted
to
surprise
us
for
him
you
are
mistaken
you
whipped
our
father
to
death
we
avenged
him
and
nothing
more
look
for
your
two
soldiers
the
alferez
looked
at
the
sergeant
surprised
they
are
at
the
bottom
of
that
precipice
we
threw
them
there
yesterday
there
they
will
rot
now
kill
me
you
will
know
nothing
more
silence
and
general
surprise
you
are
not
going
to
tell
who
were
your
accomplices
said
the
alferez
in
a
threatening
manner
and
brandishing
a
whip
a
scornful
smile
curled
the
lips
of
the
culprit
the
alferez
conferred
for
some
minutes
with
the
curate
in
a
low
voice
then
turning
to
the
soldiers
he
ordered
take
him
to
where
the
dead
bodies
are
in
a
corner
of
the
yard
upon
an
old
wagon
were
five
bodies
close
together
and
half
covered
by
a
filthy
piece
of
torn
matting
a
soldier
on
guard
was
pacing
up
and
down
and
constantly
spitting
do
you
recognize
them
asked
the
alferez
lifting
the
matting
tarsilo
did
not
respond
he
saw
the
dead
body
of
pedro
with
two
others
one
his
own
brother
riddled
with
bayonet
wounds
and
the
other
lucas
with
the
rope
still
around
his
neck
his
look
became
gloomy
and
a
sigh
seemed
to
escape
from
his
breast
do
you
know
them
they
asked
him
tarsilo
remained
silent
there
was
a
whistling
sound
and
the
whip
came
down
across
his
back
he
trembled
and
his
muscles
contracted
the
lashes
were
repeated
but
tarsilo
continued
impassive
let
them
whip
him
till
they
cut
him
to
pieces
or
till
he
makes
a
declaration
cried
the
alferez
exasperated
speak
then
said
the
directorcillo
to
him
they
will
surely
kill
you
they
led
him
back
to
the
sala
of
the
tribunal
where
the
other
prisoner
was
invoking
god
grating
his
teeth
and
shaking
on
his
legs
do
you
know
this
man
asked
father
salví
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
seen
him
replied
tarsilo
looking
with
a
certain
pity
on
the
other
the
alferez
gave
him
a
cuff
with
his
fist
and
kicked
him
tie
him
to
the
bench
without
taking
off
the
bloody
handcuffs
he
was
fastened
to
the
wooden
bench
the
unhappy
fellow
looked
about
him
as
if
in
search
of
some
one
and
his
eyes
fell
on
doña
consolacion
he
smiled
sardonically
those
present
were
surprised
and
followed
his
glance
and
saw
the
señora
she
was
biting
her
lips
i
have
never
seen
an
uglier
woman
exclaimed
tarsilo
amid
the
general
silence
i
prefer
to
lie
down
on
this
bench
as
i
am
doing
than
to
lie
by
her
side
like
the
alferez
the
muse
turned
pale
you
are
going
to
whip
me
to
death
alferez
he
continued
but
i
will
be
avenged
by
your
woman
gag
him
shouted
the
alferez
furious
and
trembling
with
rage
it
seemed
as
though
tarsilo
had
wanted
the
gag
for
when
he
had
it
in
his
mouth
his
eyes
gleamed
with
a
ray
of
satisfaction
at
a
signal
from
the
alferez
a
guard
armed
with
a
whip
began
his
cruel
task
the
whole
body
of
tarsilo
shrank
a
groan
suppressed
and
prolonged
could
be
heard
in
spite
of
the
rag
which
stopped
up
his
mouth
he
lowered
his
head
his
clothes
were
being
stained
with
blood
father
salví
pale
and
with
a
wild
look
rose
to
his
feet
laboriously
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
and
left
the
sala
with
vacillating
steps
in
the
street
he
saw
a
girl
leaning
her
back
against
the
wall
rigid
immovable
listening
attentively
looking
into
space
her
hands
extended
along
the
old
wall
the
sun
was
shining
full
upon
her
she
was
counting
it
seemed
without
breathing
the
sharp
blows
and
listening
to
that
groan
she
was
tarsilo
sister
in
the
meantime
the
scene
was
continuing
in
the
sala
the
unfortunate
fellow
overcome
with
pain
had
become
silent
and
waited
for
his
punishers
to
tire
at
last
the
soldier
breathless
let
fall
his
arm
the
alferez
pale
with
wrath
and
astonishment
made
a
signal
for
them
to
unloose
him
doña
consolacion
then
arose
and
whispered
something
into
her
ear
he
nodded
his
head
signifying
that
he
understood
to
the
well
with
him
said
he
the
filipinos
know
what
that
means
in
tagalog
they
call
it
timbain
we
do
not
know
who
could
have
been
the
inventor
of
this
method
of
punishment
but
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
he
must
have
lived
long
ago
in
the
middle
of
the
tribunal
yard
there
was
a
picturesque
roughly
made
out
of
cobble
stones
around
a
well
a
rustic
apparatus
of
bamboo
in
the
form
of
a
lever
serves
to
draw
out
the
vile
dirty
and
bad
smelling
water
broken
dishes
refuse
and
all
sorts
of
filth
collected
there
since
the
well
was
a
common
receptacle
for
everything
that
the
people
threw
away
or
found
useless
an
object
which
fell
into
the
place
no
matter
how
good
it
may
have
been
was
thereafter
surely
lost
however
the
well
was
never
closed
up
at
times
prisoners
were
condemned
to
go
down
and
make
it
deeper
not
because
it
was
thought
that
the
work
would
be
useful
in
any
way
but
because
the
work
was
so
difficult
if
a
prisoner
went
down
in
the
well
once
he
invariably
contracted
a
fever
from
which
he
died
tarsilo
contemplated
all
the
preparations
of
the
soldiers
with
a
firm
look
he
was
very
pale
and
his
lips
were
trembling
or
murmuring
a
prayer
the
haughtiness
of
his
desperation
seemed
to
have
disappeared
or
at
least
to
have
weakened
a
number
of
times
he
bent
his
head
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
ground
resigned
to
his
suffering
they
took
him
to
one
side
of
the
stone
wall
doña
consolacion
followed
smiling
the
unfortunate
wretch
glanced
enviously
toward
the
pile
of
dead
bodies
and
a
sigh
escaped
from
his
breast
speak
now
said
the
directorcillo
again
they
will
certainly
drown
you
at
least
die
without
having
suffered
so
much
when
you
come
out
of
this
you
will
die
said
a
cuaderillero
they
took
the
gag
out
of
his
mouth
and
hung
him
by
his
feet
he
had
to
go
down
head
first
and
remain
under
the
water
some
time
just
like
a
bucket
except
that
a
man
is
left
under
the
water
a
longer
time
the
alferez
went
to
look
for
a
watch
that
he
might
count
the
minutes
in
the
meantime
tarsilo
was
hanging
his
long
hair
waving
in
the
air
and
his
eyes
half
closed
if
you
are
christians
if
you
have
hearts
he
begged
in
a
low
voice
let
me
down
rapidly
and
make
my
head
strike
against
the
wall
that
i
may
die
god
would
reward
such
a
good
deed
perhaps
some
day
you
will
be
in
the
same
straits
as
i
am
now
the
alferez
returned
and
with
watch
in
hand
witnessed
the
descent
slowly
slowly
cried
doña
consolacion
following
the
poor
fellow
with
her
eyes
be
careful
the
pole
was
being
lowered
slowly
tarsilo
rubbed
against
the
projecting
stones
and
the
dirty
plants
which
grew
in
the
crevices
then
the
pole
ceased
to
move
the
alferez
was
counting
the
seconds
up
he
ordered
dryly
at
the
end
of
a
half
minute
the
silvery
harmony
of
the
drops
of
water
falling
back
into
the
well
announced
the
return
of
the
unfortunate
man
to
the
light
as
the
weight
on
the
end
of
the
lever
was
heavy
he
came
up
quickly
the
rough
pieces
of
stone
and
pebbles
torn
loose
from
the
walls
fell
with
splashes
to
the
bottom
his
face
and
hair
full
of
filthy
mud
his
body
wet
and
dripping
he
appeared
again
in
the
sight
of
the
silent
crowd
the
wind
made
him
shiver
with
cold
do
you
want
to
make
a
declaration
they
asked
him
take
care
of
my
sister
the
unhappy
one
murmured
looking
at
the
cuaderillero
with
supplication
the
bamboo
pole
creaked
again
and
again
the
condemned
man
disappeared
doña
consolacion
observed
that
the
water
remained
still
the
alferez
counted
a
minute
when
tarsilo
came
up
again
his
face
was
livid
and
his
features
contracted
he
glanced
at
those
standing
around
and
kept
open
his
bloodshot
eyes
will
you
make
a
declaration
asked
the
alferez
again
with
vexation
tarsilo
shook
his
head
and
again
they
let
him
down
his
eyelids
were
almost
closed
and
his
eyes
were
gazing
at
the
white
clouds
floating
in
the
heavens
he
bent
his
neck
to
keep
sight
of
the
light
of
day
but
he
was
soon
submerged
in
the
water
that
filthy
curtain
closed
from
him
the
sight
of
the
world
a
minute
passed
the
muse
saw
large
bubbles
of
air
come
up
to
the
surface
of
the
water
he
is
thirsty
said
she
laughing
the
water
was
again
smooth
this
time
a
minute
and
a
half
had
passed
when
the
alferez
gave
the
signal
tarsilo
features
were
no
longer
contracted
the
half
opened
lids
showed
the
white
of
his
eyes
muddy
water
clotted
with
blood
ran
out
of
his
mouth
the
cool
wind
was
blowing
but
his
body
no
longer
shivered
those
present
pale
and
terrified
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
the
alferez
made
a
signal
for
them
to
take
him
down
from
where
he
was
hanging
and
stepped
aside
for
a
few
moments
doña
consolacion
a
number
of
times
applied
the
lighted
end
of
her
cigar
to
the
bare
legs
of
tarsilo
but
his
body
did
not
quiver
it
put
out
the
light
he
has
asphyxiated
himself
murmured
a
cuaderillero
see
how
his
tongue
is
turned
as
if
he
wanted
to
swallow
it
the
other
prisoner
trembling
and
perspiring
contemplated
the
scene
like
a
madman
he
looked
about
him
the
alferez
ordered
the
directorcillo
to
question
him
señor
señor
he
groaned
i
will
tell
you
all
that
you
wish
good
let
us
see
what
is
your
name
andong
señor
bernardo
leonardo
ricardo
educardo
gerardo
or
what
andong
señor
repeated
the
imbecile
call
it
bernardo
or
whatever
you
please
said
the
alferez
decided
not
to
bother
more
about
it
what
family
name
the
man
looked
at
him
frightened
what
your
name
what
do
you
add
to
the
name
andong
ah
señor
andong
señor
those
standing
around
could
not
resist
a
laugh
the
alferez
himself
stopped
short
what
is
your
business
cocoanut
tree
pruner
señor
and
servant
for
my
who
ordered
you
to
attack
the
cuartel
nobody
señor
what
that
nobody
do
you
lie
or
we
will
put
you
in
the
well
who
ordered
you
to
do
it
speak
the
truth
that
the
truth
señor
who
who
i
ask
you
who
ordered
you
to
revolt
what
revolt
señor
that
one
last
night
when
you
were
in
the
tribunal
yard
ah
señor
exclaimed
andong
blushing
who
was
to
blame
for
that
my
señor
a
laugh
of
surprise
followed
this
reply
the
alferez
stopped
and
looked
sharply
at
the
simple
peasant
who
believed
that
his
words
had
produced
a
good
effect
more
animated
he
was
about
to
continue
when
the
crack
of
a
whip
cut
him
short
to
the
jail
ordered
the
alferez
this
afternoon
send
him
to
the
capital
chapter
xxxviii
the
accursed
the
news
that
the
prisoners
were
going
to
depart
spread
quickly
through
the
town
at
first
the
news
was
heard
with
terror
afterward
came
tears
and
lamentations
the
members
of
the
families
of
the
prisoners
were
running
about
madly
they
would
go
from
the
convent
to
the
cuartel
from
the
cuartel
to
the
tribunal
and
not
finding
consolation
anywhere
they
filled
the
air
with
cries
and
moans
the
curate
had
shut
himself
up
because
he
was
ill
the
alferez
had
increased
his
guards
who
received
the
supplicants
with
the
butts
of
their
guns
the
gobernadorcillo
a
useless
being
anyway
seemed
more
stupid
and
useless
than
ever
the
sun
was
burning
hot
but
none
of
the
unhappy
women
who
were
gathered
in
front
of
the
cuartel
thought
of
that
doray
the
gay
and
happy
wife
of
don
filipo
wandered
about
with
her
tender
little
child
in
her
arms
both
were
crying
get
out
of
the
sun
they
said
to
her
your
son
will
catch
a
fever
what
is
the
use
of
his
living
if
he
has
no
father
to
educate
him
replied
the
dispirited
woman
your
husband
is
innocent
perhaps
he
will
return
yes
when
we
are
in
our
graves
capitana
tinay
wept
and
cried
for
her
son
antonio
the
courageous
capitana
maria
gazed
toward
the
small
grate
behind
which
were
her
twins
her
only
sons
there
too
was
the
of
the
cocoanut
tree
pruner
she
was
not
crying
she
was
walking
to
and
fro
gesticulating
with
shirt
sleeves
rolled
up
and
haranguing
the
public
have
you
ever
seen
anything
equal
to
it
said
she
they
arrest
my
andong
wound
him
put
him
in
the
stocks
and
take
him
to
the
capital
all
because
he
happened
to
be
in
the
cuartel
yard
but
few
people
had
any
sympathy
for
the
mussulman
don
crisostomo
is
to
blame
for
all
of
this
sighed
a
woman
the
school
teacher
also
was
wandering
about
in
the
crowd
ñor
juan
was
no
longer
rubbing
his
hands
nor
was
he
carrying
his
yard
stick
and
plumb
line
he
had
heard
the
bad
news
and
faithful
to
his
custom
of
seeing
the
future
as
a
thing
that
had
already
happened
he
was
dressed
in
mourning
mourning
for
the
death
of
ibarra
at
two
in
the
afternoon
an
uncovered
cart
drawn
by
two
oxen
stopped
in
front
of
the
tribunal
the
cart
was
surrounded
by
the
crowd
they
wanted
to
destroy
it
do
do
that
said
capitana
maria
do
you
want
them
to
walk
this
remark
stopped
the
relatives
of
the
prisoners
twenty
soldiers
came
out
and
surrounded
the
cart
then
came
the
prisoners
the
first
was
don
filipo
he
was
tied
he
greeted
his
wife
with
a
smile
doray
broke
into
a
bitter
lamentation
and
two
soldiers
had
to
work
hard
to
keep
her
from
embracing
her
husband
antonio
the
son
of
captain
tinay
next
appeared
crying
like
a
child
a
fact
which
made
the
family
cry
all
the
more
the
imbecile
andong
broke
out
in
a
wail
when
he
saw
his
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
albino
the
former
seminary
student
came
out
with
his
hands
tied
as
did
also
the
twin
sons
of
capitana
maria
these
three
youths
were
serious
and
grave
the
last
who
came
was
ibarra
the
young
man
was
pale
he
looked
about
for
the
face
of
maria
clara
that
is
the
one
who
is
to
blame
cried
many
voices
he
is
to
blame
and
he
will
go
free
my
has
done
nothing
and
he
is
handcuffed
ibarra
turned
to
the
guards
tie
me
and
tie
me
well
elbow
to
elbow
said
he
we
have
no
orders
tie
me
the
soldiers
obeyed
the
alferez
appeared
on
armed
to
the
teeth
ten
or
fifteen
more
soldiers
followed
him
each
of
the
prisoners
had
there
in
the
crowd
his
family
praying
for
him
weeping
for
him
and
calling
him
by
the
most
affectionate
names
ibarra
was
the
only
exception
even
ñor
juan
himself
and
the
had
disappeared
what
have
you
done
to
my
husband
and
my
son
said
doray
to
ibarra
crying
see
my
poor
boy
you
have
deprived
him
of
a
father
the
grief
of
the
people
was
changed
to
wrath
against
the
young
man
accused
of
having
provoked
the
riot
the
alferez
gave
orders
to
depart
you
are
a
coward
cried
the
of
andong
to
ibarra
while
the
others
were
fighting
for
you
you
were
hiding
coward
curses
upon
you
shouted
an
old
man
following
him
cursed
be
the
gold
hoarded
up
by
your
family
to
disturb
our
peace
curse
him
curse
him
may
they
hang
you
heretic
cried
one
of
albino
relatives
and
unable
to
restrain
himself
he
picked
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
at
ibarra
the
example
was
quickly
imitated
and
a
shower
of
dust
and
stones
fell
on
the
unfortunate
youth
ibarra
suffered
it
all
impassive
without
wrath
without
a
complaint
the
unjust
vengeance
of
suffering
hearts
this
was
the
the
adios
tendered
to
him
by
his
town
the
center
of
all
his
affections
he
bowed
his
head
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
another
man
whipped
through
the
streets
of
manila
of
an
old
woman
falling
dead
at
the
sight
of
the
head
of
her
son
perhaps
the
history
of
elias
was
passing
before
his
eyes
the
cortége
moved
slowly
on
and
away
of
the
persons
who
appeared
in
a
few
opened
windows
those
who
showed
the
most
compassion
for
the
unfortunate
young
man
were
the
indifferent
and
the
curious
all
his
friends
had
hidden
themselves
yes
even
captain
basilio
who
forbade
his
daughter
sinang
to
weep
ibarra
saw
the
smouldering
ruins
of
his
house
of
the
house
of
his
fathers
where
he
had
been
born
where
he
had
lived
the
sweetest
days
of
his
infancy
and
childhood
tears
for
a
long
time
suppressed
burst
from
his
eyes
he
bowed
his
head
and
wept
wept
without
the
consolation
of
being
able
to
hide
his
weeping
tied
as
he
was
by
the
elbows
nor
did
that
grief
awaken
compassion
in
anybody
now
he
had
neither
fatherland
home
love
friends
or
future
from
a
height
a
man
contemplated
the
caravan
he
was
old
pale
thin
wrapped
in
a
woollen
blanket
and
was
leaning
with
fatigue
on
a
cane
it
was
old
tasio
who
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
what
had
happened
wanted
to
leave
his
bed
and
attend
but
his
strength
would
not
permit
it
the
old
man
followed
with
his
eyes
the
cart
until
it
disappeared
in
the
distance
he
stood
for
some
time
pensive
and
his
head
bowed
down
then
he
arose
and
laboriously
started
on
the
road
to
his
house
resting
at
every
step
the
following
day
shepherds
found
him
dead
on
the
very
threshold
of
his
solitary
retreat
chapter
xxxix
maria
clara
is
married
captain
tiago
was
very
happy
during
all
this
terrible
time
nobody
had
busied
himself
with
him
they
had
not
arrested
him
nor
had
they
submitted
him
to
excommunications
court
trials
electrical
machines
continual
hot
foot
baths
in
subterranean
places
or
to
any
of
the
other
punishments
which
are
well
known
to
certain
people
who
call
themselves
civilized
he
had
returned
to
his
manila
house
those
who
had
been
the
captain
friends
for
he
had
renounced
all
his
filipino
friends
from
the
moment
that
they
were
suspected
by
the
government
had
also
returned
to
their
homes
after
some
days
of
vacation
spent
in
the
government
buildings
the
governor
general
had
himself
ordered
these
people
to
leave
their
possessions
for
he
had
not
thought
it
fitting
that
they
should
remain
in
them
during
the
great
danger
captain
tiago
was
overflowing
with
gratitude
but
he
did
not
know
exactly
to
whom
he
was
indebted
for
such
signal
favors
aunt
isabel
attributed
the
miracle
to
the
virgin
of
antipolo
to
the
virgin
of
the
rosary
or
at
least
to
the
virgin
of
carmen
the
least
that
she
would
concede
was
that
it
was
due
to
our
lady
of
corea
according
to
the
aunt
the
miracle
was
certainly
due
to
one
of
these
virgins
captain
tiago
did
not
deny
that
it
was
a
miracle
but
he
added
i
do
not
believe
isabel
that
the
virgin
of
antipolo
could
have
done
it
alone
my
friends
have
aided
in
it
my
future
señor
linares
has
as
you
know
joked
with
señor
antonio
canovas
himself
whose
portrait
we
saw
in
and
the
good
man
could
not
suppress
a
smile
every
time
that
he
heard
any
important
news
about
the
event
and
there
was
good
reason
for
it
it
was
whispered
about
that
ibarra
was
going
to
be
hanged
that
even
if
many
proofs
had
been
lacking
at
last
one
had
appeared
which
could
confirm
the
accusation
and
that
skilled
workmen
had
declared
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
work
for
the
could
pass
for
a
fort
or
a
fortification
even
if
defective
in
some
parts
that
was
as
much
as
could
be
expected
from
ignorant
indians
these
rumors
quieted
the
captain
and
made
him
smile
just
as
the
captain
and
his
cousin
aunt
isabel
were
of
different
opinions
about
the
miracle
so
too
the
other
friends
of
the
family
were
divided
into
different
parties
those
who
followed
the
miracle
monger
and
those
who
followed
the
government
the
latter
party
however
was
quite
insignificant
the
miracle
mongers
were
into
other
factions
the
sacristan
mayor
of
binondo
the
woman
who
sold
the
wax
candles
and
the
chief
of
one
of
the
brotherhoods
all
saw
the
hand
of
god
in
the
miracle
moved
by
the
virgin
of
the
rosary
the
chinese
candle
maker
who
provided
the
captain
whenever
he
went
on
a
pilgrimage
to
antipolo
was
saying
as
he
sat
fanning
himself
and
wiggling
his
foot
what
for
you
foolish
thisee
belong
mergin
antipolo
she
can
do
muchy
more
others
no
can
do
no
plopper
say
pidgin
other
man
captain
tiago
held
the
chinaman
in
great
estimation
and
made
him
pass
for
a
prophet
and
doctor
examining
the
hand
of
his
deceased
wife
in
the
sixth
month
of
her
pregnancy
he
had
prophesied
if
thisee
one
no
man
and
no
go
dead
side
will
bery
good
woman
and
so
it
was
that
maria
clara
came
to
this
earth
and
fulfilled
the
chinaman
prophecy
captain
tiago
being
a
prudent
and
timid
person
could
not
decide
the
question
of
the
miracle
as
easily
as
the
trojan
paris
he
could
not
give
preference
to
one
of
the
virgins
for
fear
of
offending
some
other
of
them
a
thing
which
might
bring
about
grave
results
prudence
he
said
to
himself
be
prudent
let
us
not
lose
all
now
he
was
in
the
midst
of
these
doubts
when
the
party
in
favor
of
the
government
or
the
governmental
party
arrived
doña
victorina
don
tiburcio
and
linares
doña
victorina
did
all
the
talking
for
the
three
men
and
for
herself
also
she
mentioned
the
visits
which
linares
had
made
to
the
governor
general
and
repeatedly
brought
out
the
benefits
derived
from
having
a
relative
of
categoría
for
some
days
past
she
had
been
trying
to
be
andalusian
by
suppressing
the
d
in
all
words
and
in
changing
the
s
to
z
no
one
could
get
the
idea
out
of
her
head
she
would
prefer
to
lose
her
front
curls
first
yes
she
said
in
speaking
of
ibarra
that
fellow
merits
very
well
all
that
he
is
going
to
get
i
told
you
so
when
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
i
told
you
he
was
a
filibustero
what
did
the
general
tell
you
cousin
what
did
he
say
what
news
did
you
give
him
about
ibarra
seeing
that
the
cousin
hesitated
in
his
reply
she
went
on
directing
her
words
to
captain
tiago
believe
me
if
they
convict
him
as
is
to
be
hoped
it
will
be
through
my
cousin
señora
señora
protested
linares
but
she
did
not
give
him
any
time
oh
what
a
diplomat
you
have
turned
out
to
be
but
we
all
know
that
you
are
the
adviser
of
the
governor
general
that
he
could
not
live
without
you
ah
what
a
pleasure
to
see
you
clarita
maria
clara
seemed
paler
than
ever
although
she
was
now
quite
recovered
from
her
illness
sadly
smiling
she
approached
and
greeted
doña
victorina
with
a
formal
kiss
after
the
customary
words
had
been
exchanged
doña
went
on
with
her
false
andalusian
we
came
to
visit
you
you
have
been
saved
by
the
efforts
of
your
friends
looking
significantly
at
linares
god
has
protected
my
father
said
the
girl
in
a
low
voice
yes
clarita
but
the
time
for
miracles
has
passed
long
ago
as
we
spaniards
say
no
trust
in
the
virgin
and
save
yourself
by
running
the
th
the
ot
ot
other
way
said
the
doctor
correcting
her
proverbial
quotation
captain
tiago
who
had
not
yet
found
opportunity
to
say
a
word
ventured
to
ask
her
giving
much
attention
to
her
reply
so
you
doña
victorina
believe
that
the
virgin
that
is
precisely
what
we
came
for
to
speak
to
you
about
the
virgin
replied
she
indicating
maria
clara
we
have
a
matter
to
talk
over
the
maiden
understood
that
she
ought
to
retire
she
sought
an
excuse
and
went
away
supporting
herself
on
the
furniture
as
she
walked
along
what
was
said
in
the
conference
which
followed
was
so
low
and
mean
that
we
prefer
to
omit
it
it
is
sufficient
for
us
to
say
that
when
they
took
their
leave
all
were
happy
and
that
captain
tiago
afterward
said
to
his
cousin
isabel
send
word
to
the
restaurant
that
we
are
going
to
give
a
fiesta
you
get
maria
ready
to
be
married
in
a
short
time
aunt
isabel
looked
at
him
surprised
you
will
see
when
señor
linares
is
our
all
the
palaces
will
be
open
to
us
they
will
be
envying
us
they
will
all
die
with
envy
and
thus
it
was
that
at
eight
on
the
following
evening
captain
tiago
house
was
again
full
of
guests
only
that
this
time
the
men
whom
he
had
invited
were
either
spaniards
or
chinamen
while
the
fair
sex
was
represented
by
spaniards
born
in
the
peninsula
or
in
the
philippines
the
larger
part
of
our
acquaintances
was
there
father
sibyla
father
salví
and
several
other
franciscans
and
dominicans
the
old
lieutenant
of
the
civil
guard
señor
guevara
more
melancholy
than
ever
the
alferez
who
related
his
battle
for
the
thousandth
time
feeling
himself
head
and
shoulders
above
everybody
and
a
veritable
don
juan
de
austria
now
a
lieutenant
with
the
rank
of
commander
de
espadaña
who
looked
at
the
former
with
respect
and
fear
and
avoided
his
glance
and
the
indignant
doña
victorina
linares
was
not
yet
present
for
being
a
very
important
personage
it
was
fitting
that
he
should
arrive
later
than
the
others
maria
clara
the
subject
of
all
the
gossip
was
the
center
of
a
group
of
women
she
had
greeted
and
received
them
ceremoniously
but
did
not
throw
off
her
air
of
sadness
psh
said
one
of
the
girls
a
little
a
cute
little
thing
replied
another
but
he
might
have
selected
some
one
of
a
more
intelligent
appearance
it
the
money
he
a
fellow
and
sells
himself
for
a
good
price
in
another
part
of
the
room
they
were
talking
like
this
marry
when
her
former
betrothed
is
about
to
be
hanged
i
call
that
prudence
to
have
one
on
hand
as
a
substitute
possibly
the
young
maiden
heard
these
remarks
as
she
sat
in
a
chair
near
by
arranging
a
tray
of
flowers
for
her
hand
was
seen
to
tremble
she
turned
pale
and
bit
her
lips
a
number
of
times
the
conversation
among
the
men
was
in
a
loud
tone
naturally
they
were
conversant
with
the
recent
happenings
all
were
talking
even
don
tiburcio
with
the
exception
of
father
sibyla
who
maintained
a
disdainful
silence
i
have
heard
that
your
reverence
leaves
the
town
father
salví
asked
the
newly
made
lieutenant
now
made
more
amiable
by
the
star
on
his
sleeve
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
now
in
san
diego
i
am
permanently
settled
in
manila
now
and
you
i
also
leave
the
town
replied
the
former
alferez
straightening
up
the
government
needs
me
to
take
command
of
a
flying
column
to
clear
the
provinces
of
filibusteros
friar
salví
looked
him
over
from
head
to
foot
and
turned
his
back
to
him
completely
is
it
yet
known
for
a
certainty
what
is
to
become
of
the
leader
of
the
revolutionists
asked
a
government
employee
are
you
referring
to
crisostomo
ibarra
asked
another
what
is
most
probable
and
most
just
is
that
he
be
hanged
as
those
were
in
he
will
be
exiled
said
the
old
lieutenant
dryly
exiled
nothing
more
than
exiled
but
it
will
be
a
perpetual
exile
exclaimed
several
at
the
same
time
if
that
young
fellow
lieutenant
guevara
went
on
to
say
in
a
loud
voice
had
been
more
cautious
if
he
had
trusted
certain
people
less
with
whom
he
had
correspondence
and
if
the
officers
had
not
made
a
subtle
interpretation
of
what
was
written
if
it
had
not
been
for
all
of
this
that
young
man
would
surely
have
gone
free
this
statement
by
the
old
lieutenant
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
produced
a
great
surprise
in
the
room
those
who
heard
it
did
not
know
what
to
say
father
salví
looked
in
another
direction
perhaps
so
as
not
to
meet
the
dark
look
which
the
old
man
directed
toward
him
maria
clara
dropped
her
flowers
and
sat
motionless
father
sibyla
the
one
who
knew
how
to
keep
silent
appeared
to
be
the
only
one
who
knew
how
to
ask
questions
are
you
referring
to
the
letters
señor
guevara
i
am
telling
what
the
defendant
attorney
told
me
he
has
taken
up
the
case
with
zeal
and
interest
aside
from
some
ambiguous
lines
which
this
young
man
wrote
to
a
young
woman
before
departing
for
europe
they
have
found
no
proof
to
sustain
the
accusation
in
these
few
lines
the
officers
saw
a
plan
and
threat
against
the
government
and
what
about
the
declaration
made
by
the
bandit
before
he
died
that
statement
has
proved
of
no
account
since
according
to
the
bandit
himself
the
conspirators
never
had
communicated
with
the
young
man
but
only
with
one
lucas
who
was
ibarra
enemy
as
they
have
been
able
to
prove
and
who
committed
suicide
perhaps
from
remorse
it
has
been
proved
that
the
papers
found
in
the
possession
of
the
dead
man
were
forged
since
the
handwriting
was
like
that
of
ibarra
seven
years
ago
but
not
like
that
of
a
fact
which
shows
that
it
was
copied
from
the
letter
used
as
evidence
against
him
besides
his
attorney
says
that
if
ibarra
had
not
admitted
the
genuineness
of
the
letter
he
would
have
been
able
to
do
much
for
him
but
at
the
sight
of
it
the
young
man
turned
pale
lost
heart
and
acknowledged
that
he
had
written
it
do
you
say
asked
a
franciscan
that
the
letter
was
directed
to
a
young
woman
how
did
it
get
into
the
hands
of
the
officers
the
lieutenant
did
not
reply
he
looked
for
a
moment
at
friar
salví
and
then
walked
off
twisting
nervously
the
end
of
his
grey
beard
in
the
meantime
others
were
commenting
something
like
this
there
you
see
the
hand
of
god
said
one
even
the
women
hate
him
he
had
his
house
burned
thinking
that
he
could
thus
save
himself
but
he
did
not
reckon
with
his
host
that
is
with
his
querida
with
his
babai
added
another
smiling
that
is
god
work
santiago
protects
spain
the
old
army
officer
stopped
and
approached
maria
clara
she
was
listening
to
the
conversation
immovable
in
her
seat
the
flowers
were
at
her
feet
you
are
a
very
prudent
young
woman
said
the
old
lieutenant
to
her
in
a
low
voice
you
have
done
well
to
hand
over
the
letter
in
this
way
you
will
assure
yourself
of
a
peaceful
future
with
dull
eyes
and
biting
her
lips
she
looked
at
him
as
he
walked
away
luckily
aunt
isabel
passed
her
at
this
moment
maria
clara
summoned
enough
strength
to
catch
hold
of
her
aunt
dress
aunt
she
murmured
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
the
latter
frightened
as
she
saw
the
young
woman
face
take
me
to
my
room
she
begged
clinging
to
the
arm
of
the
old
woman
in
order
to
raise
herself
to
her
feet
are
you
sick
my
child
you
seem
to
have
lost
all
your
strength
what
is
the
matter
with
you
a
little
sick

my

the

that
i

you
are
cold
do
you
want
some
tea
maria
clara
shook
her
head
negatively
she
closed
the
door
of
her
room
and
locked
it
and
her
strength
failing
her
she
fell
to
the
floor
at
the
feet
of
an
image
weeping
and
sobbing
mother
mother
my
mother
the
moonlight
was
shining
through
the
open
window
and
door
which
led
out
upon
the
azotea
the
orchestra
continued
playing
gay
waltzes
the
laughter
and
the
hum
of
conversation
could
be
heard
in
her
bedroom
a
number
of
times
her
family
aunt
isabel
doña
victorina
and
even
linares
knocked
at
her
door
but
maria
clara
did
not
move
there
was
a
rattle
in
her
throat
hours
passed
the
pleasures
of
the
table
ended
and
dancing
followed
her
little
candle
burned
out
but
the
maiden
lay
quietly
on
the
floor
the
rays
of
moonlight
shining
upon
her
at
the
foot
of
an
image
of
the
mother
of
jesus
gradually
the
noises
in
the
house
died
away
the
lights
were
put
out
and
aunt
isabel
again
knocked
at
the
door
of
her
room
let
us
leave
her
she
is
sleeping
said
her
aunt
at
her
age
with
nothing
to
trouble
her
she
sleeps
like
a
corpse
when
all
was
again
silent
maria
arose
slowly
and
glanced
around
her
she
saw
the
azotea
and
the
small
climbing
plants
bathed
in
the
melancholy
light
of
the
moon
a
peaceful
future
sleeping
like
a
corpse
she
murmured
in
a
low
voice
and
turned
toward
the
azotea
the
city
was
quiet
only
the
noise
of
an
occasional
carriage
passing
over
the
wooden
bridge
could
be
heard
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
while
the
tranquil
waters
of
the
river
were
reflecting
the
moonlight
the
maiden
raised
her
eyes
to
the
pure
sky
slowly
she
took
off
her
rings
her
her
earrings
and
her
and
placing
them
upon
the
balustrade
of
the
azotea
she
looked
out
toward
the
river
a
banca
loaded
with
rice
grass
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
landing
on
the
bank
of
the
river
at
the
rear
of
the
house
one
of
the
two
men
who
were
propelling
the
boat
went
up
the
stone
steps
leaped
over
the
wall
and
a
few
seconds
afterward
steps
were
heard
coming
up
the
azotea
maria
clara
saw
him
stop
on
discovering
her
but
it
was
for
only
a
moment
the
man
advanced
slowly
and
at
about
three
steps
from
the
maiden
stopped
again
maria
clara
stepped
back
crisostomo
she
gasped
full
of
terror
yes
i
am
crisostomo
replied
the
young
man
in
a
grave
voice
an
enemy
a
man
who
has
good
reason
to
hate
me
elias
has
helped
me
out
of
the
prison
into
which
my
friends
had
thrown
me
silence
followed
these
words
maria
clara
bowed
her
head
and
allowed
both
her
hands
to
drop
at
her
side
ibarra
continued
beside
the
dead
body
of
my
mother
i
swore
to
make
you
happy
whatever
might
be
my
destiny
you
can
break
your
oath
she
was
not
your
mother
but
i
who
am
her
son
i
hold
her
memory
sacred
and
running
great
risk
i
have
come
here
to
fulfill
my
oath
fortune
permits
me
to
speak
with
you
personally
maria
we
shall
not
see
each
other
again
you
are
young
and
perhaps
some
day
your
conscience
may
accuse
you
i
come
to
tell
you
before
leaving
that
i
forgive
you
now
may
you
be
happy
and
ibarra
tried
to
leave
but
the
maiden
stopped
him
crisostomo
she
said
god
has
sent
you
to
save
me
from
desperation
hear
me
and
judge
me
ibarra
wished
to
withdraw
gently
from
her
i
have
not
come
said
he
to
call
you
to
account
i
have
come
to
give
you
peace
i
do
not
want
the
peace
which
you
give
me
i
will
give
myself
peace
you
despise
me
and
your
contempt
will
make
my
life
bitter
till
death
ibarra
saw
the
poor
girl
desperation
and
asked
her
what
she
desired
that
you
may
believe
that
i
have
always
loved
you
crisostomo
smiled
bitterly
ah
you
doubt
me
you
doubt
the
friend
of
your
infancy
who
has
never
hidden
a
single
thought
from
you
exclaimed
she
in
grief
i
understand
you
when
you
know
my
history
the
history
which
they
revealed
to
me
during
my
illness
you
will
pity
me
and
you
will
no
longer
answer
my
grief
with
that
bitter
smile
why
did
you
not
let
me
die
in
the
hands
of
my
ignorant
doctor
you
and
i
would
have
been
happier
then
maria
clara
rested
a
moment
and
then
continued
you
have
doubted
me
you
have
wished
my
mother
to
pardon
me
during
one
of
those
nights
of
suffering
a
man
revealed
to
me
the
name
of
my
true
father
and
forbade
me
to
love
you
unless
my
true
father
should
pardon
you
for
the
offense
you
committed
against
him
ibarra
recoiled
and
looked
in
terror
at
the
maiden
yes
she
continued
this
man
told
me
that
he
could
not
permit
our
marriage
since
his
conscience
would
not
allow
it
and
he
would
find
himself
compelled
to
publish
the
truth
at
the
risk
of
causing
a
great
scandal
because
my
father
is
and
she
whispered
a
name
in
the
young
man
ear
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
what
was
i
to
do
ought
i
to
sacrifice
to
my
love
the
memory
of
my
mother
the
honor
of
the
man
who
innocently
supposes
himself
my
father
and
the
good
name
of
my
real
father
could
i
do
that
without
you
despising
me
for
it
but
the
proof
have
you
proof
you
need
proof
exclaimed
crisostomo
deeply
agitated
the
maiden
drew
two
letters
from
her
bosom
two
of
my
mother
letters
two
letters
written
in
remorse
before
i
was
born
take
them
read
them
and
you
will
see
how
she
cursed
me
and
desired
my
death
which
my
father
in
vain
tried
to
cause
by
drugs
these
letters
were
forgotten
in
the
house
where
he
lived
a
man
found
them
and
kept
them
they
would
only
give
them
to
me
in
exchange
for
your
letter
to
make
certain
as
they
said
that
i
would
not
marry
you
without
the
consent
of
my
father
from
the
time
that
i
began
to
carry
them
in
my
bosom
instead
of
your
letter
my
heart
was
chilled
i
sacrificed
you
i
sacrificed
my
love
what
would
not
a
person
do
for
a
dead
mother
and
two
living
fathers
did
i
suspect
the
use
to
which
they
were
going
to
put
your
letter
ibarra
was
prostrated
maria
clara
went
on
what
was
there
left
for
me
could
i
tell
you
who
was
my
father
could
i
ask
you
to
seek
the
pardon
of
him
who
had
so
much
desired
my
death
and
who
made
your
father
suffer
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
keep
the
secret
to
myself
and
to
die
suffering
now
my
friend
you
know
the
sad
history
of
your
poor
maria
will
you
still
have
that
contemptuous
smile
for
her
maria
you
are
a
saint
i
am
happy
now
that
you
believe
me
however
added
the
young
man
changing
his
tone
i
have
heard
that
you
are
about
to
marry
yes
sobbed
the
maiden
my
father
asked
this
sacrifice
of
me
he
has
fed
me
and
loved
me
and
it
was
not
his
duty
i
pay
him
this
debt
of
gratitude
which
i
owe
him
by
assuring
him
peace
through
this
new
relative
but
but
i
shall
not
forget
the
oaths
of
fidelity
which
i
made
to
you
what
do
you
think
of
doing
asked
ibarra
trying
to
read
her
eyes
the
future
is
obscure
and
destiny
is
hidden
in
darkness
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
to
do
but
i
know
that
i
can
love
only
once
and
that
without
love
i
never
will
belong
to
any
one
and
you
what
is
to
become
of
you
i
am
nothing
but
a
fugitive
i
am
fleeing
in
a
very
short
time
they
will
discover
my
escape
maria
maria
clara
clasped
her
arms
about
her
lover
neck
kissed
his
lips
repeatedly
hugged
him
and
then
abruptly
breaking
away
from
him
said
flee
flee
adios
ibarra
looked
at
her
his
eyes
sparkling
but
she
motioned
and
he
went
away
staggering
like
a
drunken
man
again
he
leaped
over
the
wall
and
entered
the
banca
maria
clara
leaning
on
the
door
casing
watched
him
depart
elias
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
profoundly
chapter
xl
the
pursuit
on
the
lake
listen
señor
to
my
plan
said
elias
as
they
directed
the
banca
toward
san
miguel
i
will
for
the
present
hide
you
in
the
house
of
my
friend
in
mandaluyong
i
will
bring
you
all
your
money
which
i
have
saved
and
kept
for
you
at
the
foot
of
the
old
balitî
tree
in
the
mysterious
tomb
of
your
grandfather
you
shall
leave
the
country
to
go
to
a
strange
land
interrupted
ibarra
to
live
in
peace
the
remaining
days
of
your
life
you
have
friends
in
spain
you
are
rich
you
can
get
yourself
pardoned
by
all
means
a
foreign
land
is
better
for
you
than
your
own
country
crisostomo
did
not
reply
he
meditated
in
silence
just
then
they
reached
the
pasig
and
the
banca
was
headed
up
the
stream
over
the
bridge
of
spain
a
was
galloping
at
high
speed
and
a
prolonged
sharp
whistle
was
heard
elias
replied
ibarra
you
owe
your
misfortunes
to
my
family
you
have
saved
my
life
twice
i
owe
you
not
only
gratitude
but
also
restitution
of
your
fortune
you
advise
me
to
go
to
a
foreign
land
and
live
then
come
with
me
and
we
will
live
like
brothers
here
you
too
are
miserable
elias
sadly
replied
impossible
it
is
true
that
i
can
neither
love
nor
be
happy
in
my
country
but
i
can
suffer
and
die
in
it
and
perhaps
die
for
it
that
would
be
something
let
my
country
misfortune
be
my
own
misfortune
since
no
noble
thought
unites
us
and
since
our
hearts
do
not
beat
in
harmony
at
the
mention
of
a
single
word
at
least
let
a
common
misery
unite
me
to
my
fellow
countrymen
at
least
let
me
weep
with
them
over
our
grief
let
the
same
misery
oppress
all
our
hearts
then
why
do
you
advise
me
to
leave
because
in
other
lands
you
can
be
happy
and
i
can
not
because
you
are
not
made
to
suffer
and
because
you
would
hate
your
country
if
some
day
you
should
see
the
cause
of
your
misfortune
and
to
hate
one
own
country
is
the
greatest
misery
you
are
unjust
to
me
exclaimed
ibarra
with
bitter
reproach
you
forget
that
i
have
scarcely
arrived
here
and
that
i
have
already
sought
its
welfare
do
not
be
offended
señor
i
am
not
reproaching
you
would
to
god
that
all
might
imitate
you
but
i
do
not
ask
for
the
impossible
and
you
should
not
be
offended
if
i
tell
you
that
your
heart
deceives
you
you
love
your
country
because
your
father
has
taught
you
to
love
it
you
love
it
because
you
had
in
it
your
love
your
fortune
your
youth
because
it
smiled
on
you
and
because
it
has
not
until
now
done
you
an
injustice
you
love
your
country
as
we
all
love
that
which
makes
us
happy
but
on
that
day
when
you
see
yourself
poor
ragged
hungry
persecuted
denounced
and
betrayed
by
your
very
countrymen
on
that
day
you
will
curse
yourself
your
country
and
all
your
words
grieve
me
said
ibarra
resentfully
elias
bowed
his
head
meditated
and
replied
i
wish
to
set
you
right
señor
and
to
avoid
a
miserable
future
for
you
you
remember
the
time
when
i
was
talking
to
you
in
this
same
banca
and
under
the
light
of
the
same
moon
it
was
a
month
ago
a
few
days
more
or
less
then
you
were
happy
the
plea
of
the
unfortunates
did
not
reach
you
you
disdained
their
complaints
because
they
were
complaints
from
criminals
you
gave
ear
to
their
enemies
and
in
spite
of
my
reasons
and
pleas
you
put
yourself
on
the
side
of
their
oppressors
on
you
depended
at
that
time
whether
i
should
turn
criminal
or
allow
my
life
to
be
taken
in
fulfillment
of
my
sacred
pledge
god
has
not
permitted
it
because
the
old
chief
of
the
bandits
has
been
killed
a
month
has
passed
and
now
you
think
differently
you
are
right
elias
but
man
is
influenced
by
changes
in
circumstances
then
i
was
blind
and
obstinate
what
did
i
know
now
misfortune
has
torn
the
veil
from
my
eyes
the
solitude
and
misery
of
my
prison
life
have
taught
me
now
i
see
the
horrible
cancer
which
is
sapping
the
life
of
society
which
hangs
to
its
flesh
and
which
requires
violent
extirpation
they
have
opened
my
eyes
they
have
made
me
see
the
ulcer
they
force
me
to
become
a
criminal
i
will
be
a
filibustero
but
a
true
filibustero
i
will
call
upon
all
the
unfortunates
on
all
who
have
beating
hearts
within
their
breasts
on
all
who
sent
you
to
me
no
no
i
will
not
be
criminal
it
is
never
a
crime
to
fight
for
one
country
we
for
three
centuries
have
given
them
our
hand
we
have
asked
them
for
their
love
we
have
anxiously
wished
to
call
them
our
brothers
how
have
they
replied
with
insults
and
jests
denying
us
even
the
quality
of
being
human
beings
there
is
no
god
there
is
no
hope
there
is
no
humanity
there
is
nothing
but
the
right
of
force
ibarra
was
excited
his
whole
body
was
trembling
they
passed
by
the
governor
general
palace
and
believed
they
saw
agitation
and
movement
among
the
guards
have
they
discovered
our
flight
murmured
elias
lie
down
señor
so
that
i
can
cover
you
up
with
the
grass
for
when
we
cross
over
to
the
side
of
the
river
near
the
powder
house
the
sentry
may
be
surprised
at
seeing
two
of
us
in
this
small
banca
as
elias
had
foreseen
the
sentry
stopped
him
and
asked
him
where
he
came
from
from
manila
with
grass
for
the
magistrates
and
curates
replied
he
imitating
the
accent
of
one
from
pandakan
a
sergeant
came
out
and
was
informed
what
was
going
on
sulung
go
on
said
he
i
warn
you
not
to
receive
any
one
in
your
banca
a
prisoner
has
just
escaped
if
you
capture
him
and
hand
him
over
to
me
i
will
give
you
a
good
reward
all
right
señor
what
is
his
description
he
wears
a
frock
coat
and
speaks
spanish
with
that
much
be
on
the
watch
the
banca
went
on
elias
turned
his
face
and
saw
the
shadow
of
the
sentry
still
standing
on
the
bank
of
the
river
we
will
lose
several
minutes
said
he
in
a
low
voice
we
will
have
to
go
up
the
beata
river
in
order
to
carry
out
my
pretense
of
being
from
peña
francia
the
town
was
sleeping
in
the
light
of
the
moon
crisostomo
arose
to
admire
the
sepulchral
peace
of
nature
the
river
was
narrow
and
its
banks
formed
a
plain
planted
with
rice
elias
threw
the
load
on
the
bank
picked
up
a
piece
of
bamboo
and
drew
out
from
under
the
grass
in
the
banca
some
empty
sacks
they
went
on
rowing
you
are
master
of
your
own
will
señor
and
of
your
own
future
said
he
to
crisostomo
who
kept
silent
but
if
you
will
permit
me
to
offer
a
suggestion
i
say
to
you
look
well
at
what
you
are
going
to
do
you
are
about
to
start
a
war
for
you
have
money
talent
and
you
will
quickly
find
aid
for
unfortunately
many
are
discontented
furthermore
in
this
fight
which
you
are
to
begin
those
who
are
going
to
suffer
most
are
the
defenseless
the
innocent
the
same
sentiments
which
a
month
ago
prompted
me
to
come
to
you
and
ask
for
reforms
are
those
which
now
move
me
to
ask
you
to
reflect
the
country
señor
is
not
thinking
of
separating
itself
from
the
mother
country
it
asks
only
a
little
liberty
a
little
justice
a
little
love
the
discontented
will
assist
you
the
criminals
and
the
desperate
but
the
people
will
hold
aloof
you
are
mistaken
if
seeing
everything
dark
you
believe
that
the
country
is
desperate
the
country
suffers
yes
but
it
still
hopes
believe
me
and
will
only
rise
in
revolt
when
it
has
lost
patience
that
is
when
those
who
govern
wish
it
which
is
still
far
off
i
myself
would
not
follow
you
i
shall
never
take
recourse
to
these
extreme
remedies
while
i
see
hope
in
men
then
i
will
go
without
you
replied
crisostomo
resolutely
is
it
your
firm
decision
yes
my
firm
and
only
decision
i
call
to
witness
the
memory
of
my
father
i
can
not
allow
them
to
deprive
me
of
peace
and
happiness
with
impunity
i
who
have
desired
only
my
country
welfare
i
who
have
respected
all
and
have
suffered
on
account
of
a
hypocritical
religion
on
account
of
love
for
my
country
how
have
they
responded
to
me
by
burying
me
in
an
infamous
prison
and
by
prostituting
my
fiancée
no
not
to
avenge
myself
would
be
a
crime
it
would
be
encouraging
them
to
commit
new
injustices
no
it
would
be
cowardice
it
would
be
pusillanimity
to
weep
and
groan
while
there
is
life
and
vigor
when
to
insult
and
challenge
are
added
scoffery
and
contemptuous
ridicule
i
will
arouse
this
ignorant
people
i
will
make
them
see
their
misery
this
people
who
do
not
think
of
each
other
as
brothers
who
are
mere
wolves
devouring
each
other
i
will
tell
them
to
rise
against
this
oppression
and
appeal
to
the
eternal
right
of
mankind
to
conquer
their
liberty
innocent
people
will
suffer
all
the
better
can
you
lead
me
to
the
mountain
till
you
are
safe
replied
elias
they
again
went
up
the
pasig
they
spoke
from
time
to
time
of
indifferent
things
santa
aña
murmured
ibarra
do
you
recognize
that
house
they
passed
by
the
country
house
of
the
jesuits
there
i
passed
many
happy
and
joyful
years
sighed
elias
in
my
time
we
used
to
come
here
every
month
then
i
was
like
the
others
i
had
fortune
family
i
was
dreaming
and
planning
a
future
for
myself
in
those
days
i
used
to
visit
my
sister
in
the
neighboring
convent
she
made
me
a
present
of
a
piece
of
her
own
handiwork
a
girl
friend
used
to
accompany
her
a
beautiful
girl
all
has
passed
like
a
dream
they
remained
silent
till
they
arrived
at
those
who
have
glided
over
the
bosom
of
the
pasig
on
one
of
those
magical
nights
when
the
moon
pours
forth
its
melancholy
poetry
from
the
pure
blue
of
the
sky
when
the
darkness
hides
the
misery
of
men
and
silence
drowns
the
harsh
accents
of
their
voices
when
nature
alone
speaks
those
who
have
seen
such
nights
on
the
pasig
will
understand
the
feelings
which
filled
the
hearts
of
both
young
men
in
the
carbineer
was
half
asleep
and
seeing
that
the
banca
was
empty
and
offered
no
booty
for
him
to
seize
according
to
the
traditional
custom
of
his
corps
and
the
use
made
of
that
position
he
readily
let
them
pass
on
nor
did
the
civil
guard
at
pasig
suspect
anything
and
they
were
not
molested
it
was
just
beginning
to
dawn
when
they
reached
the
lake
calm
and
smooth
as
a
gigantic
mirror
the
moon
was
growing
dim
and
the
orient
was
rosy
with
the
tints
of
morning
at
a
distance
a
mass
of
grey
could
be
discerned
advancing
toward
the
banca
the
falúa
or
government
steamboat
is
coming
murmured
elias
lie
down
and
i
will
cover
you
with
these
sacks
the
outline
of
the
vessel
became
more
clear
and
perceptible
she
is
putting
in
between
the
beach
and
us
observed
elias
uneasily
and
then
he
changed
the
course
of
the
banca
a
little
rowing
toward
binangonan
to
his
great
surprise
he
noticed
that
the
falúa
was
also
changing
its
course
while
a
voice
cried
out
to
him
elias
stopped
and
meditated
the
shore
of
the
lake
was
very
far
off
and
they
would
soon
be
in
the
range
of
the
rifles
on
the
falúa
he
thought
of
returning
to
the
pasig
his
banca
was
swifter
than
the
falúa
but
fate
was
against
him
another
boat
was
coming
up
the
pasig
and
they
could
see
the
helmets
and
shining
bayonets
of
the
civil
guards
we
are
caught
he
murmured
turning
pale
he
looked
at
his
robust
arms
and
taking
the
only
course
which
remained
to
him
he
began
to
row
with
all
his
strength
toward
the
island
of
talim
in
the
meantime
the
sun
had
risen
the
banca
glided
along
rapidly
elias
saw
some
men
standing
up
on
the
falúa
making
signals
to
him
do
you
know
how
to
manage
a
banca
he
asked
ibarra
yes
why
because
we
are
lost
if
i
do
not
leap
into
the
water
and
make
them
lose
the
trail
they
will
follow
me
i
swim
and
dive
well
i
will
take
them
away
from
you
and
then
you
can
save
yourself
no
you
remain
and
we
will
sell
our
lives
dearly
useless
we
have
no
arms
and
with
those
rifles
they
will
kill
us
like
birds
at
that
moment
a
chiss
was
heard
in
the
water
like
the
fall
of
a
hot
body
and
was
followed
immediately
by
a
report
do
you
see
said
elias
putting
his
paddle
in
the
banca
we
will
see
each
other
again
at
the
tomb
of
your
grandfather
on
nochebeuna
christmas
eve
save
yourself
and
you
god
has
taken
me
through
greater
dangers
elias
took
off
his
camisa
a
ball
grazed
his
hands
and
the
report
sounded
out
without
being
disturbed
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
ibarra
who
was
still
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
then
he
arose
and
leaped
into
the
water
pushing
away
the
small
craft
with
his
foot
a
number
of
cries
were
heard
soon
at
some
distance
the
head
of
the
young
man
appeared
above
the
water
as
if
to
get
breath
dropping
out
of
sight
at
the
next
instant
there
there
he
is
cried
a
number
of
voices
and
the
balls
from
their
rifles
whistled
again
the
falúa
and
the
other
banca
took
up
the
chase
a
light
track
of
foam
marked
his
course
every
moment
leading
farther
and
farther
away
from
ibarra
banca
which
drifted
along
as
if
abandoned
every
time
that
the
swimmer
raised
his
head
to
breathe
the
civil
guards
and
the
men
on
board
the
falúa
discharged
their
guns
at
him
the
pursuit
continued
ibarra
little
banca
was
already
far
off
the
swimmer
was
approaching
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
was
now
some
fifty
yards
distant
from
it
the
rowers
were
already
tired
but
elias
was
not
for
his
head
often
appeared
above
the
water
and
each
time
in
a
different
direction
so
as
to
disconcert
his
pursuers
no
longer
was
there
a
light
trail
to
betray
the
course
of
the
diver
for
the
last
time
they
saw
him
near
the
shore
some
ten
yards
off
and
they
opened
fire
then
minutes
and
minutes
passed
nothing
appeared
again
on
the
tranquil
surface
of
the
lake
half
an
hour
afterward
one
of
the
rowers
pretended
to
have
discovered
signs
of
blood
in
the
water
near
the
shore
but
his
companions
shook
their
heads
in
a
manner
which
might
mean
either
yes
or
no
chapter
xli
father
dámaso
explains
in
vain
the
costly
wedding
gifts
were
heaped
upon
the
table
neither
the
diamonds
in
their
blue
velvet
caskets
nor
the
embroidered
piña
nor
the
pieces
of
silk
had
any
attractions
for
maria
clara
the
maiden
looked
at
the
paper
which
gave
the
account
of
ibarra
death
drowned
in
the
lake
but
she
neither
saw
nor
read
it
of
a
sudden
she
felt
two
hands
over
her
eyes
they
held
her
fast
while
a
joyous
voice
father
dámaso
said
to
her
who
am
i
who
am
i
maria
clara
jumped
from
her
seat
and
looked
at
him
with
terror
in
her
eyes
you
little
goose
were
you
frightened
eh
you
were
not
expecting
me
well
i
have
come
from
the
provinces
to
attend
your
wedding
and
coming
up
to
her
again
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
her
maria
clara
approached
timidly
and
raising
it
to
her
lips
kissed
it
what
is
the
matter
with
you
maria
asked
the
franciscan
losing
his
gay
smile
and
becoming
very
uneasy
your
hand
is
cold
you
are
pale
are
you
ill
my
little
girl
and
father
dámaso
drew
her
up
to
him
with
a
fondness
of
which
no
one
would
have
thought
him
capable
he
grasped
both
the
maiden
hands
and
gave
her
a
questioning
look
have
you
any
confidence
in
your
godfather
he
asked
in
a
reproachful
tone
come
sit
down
here
and
tell
me
your
little
troubles
just
as
you
used
to
do
when
you
were
a
child
when
you
wanted
to
make
wax
figures
you
surely
know
that
i
have
always
loved
you
i
have
never
scolded
you
father
dámaso
voice
ceased
to
be
brusque
its
modulations
were
even
caressing
maria
clara
began
to
weep
are
you
weeping
my
child
why
are
you
weeping
have
you
quarrelled
with
linares
maria
clara
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
no
it
is
not
he
now
cried
the
maiden
father
dámaso
looked
at
her
full
of
surprise
do
you
not
want
to
entrust
your
secrets
to
me
have
i
not
always
managed
to
satisfy
your
smallest
caprices
the
young
woman
raised
her
eyes
full
of
tears
toward
him
she
looked
at
him
for
some
time
and
then
began
to
weep
bitterly
do
not
cry
so
my
child
for
your
tears
pain
me
tell
me
your
troubles
you
will
see
how
your
godfather
loves
you
maria
clara
approached
him
slowly
and
fell
on
her
knees
at
his
feet
then
raising
her
face
bathed
in
tears
she
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
scarcely
audible
do
you
still
love
me
child
then
protect
my
father
and
break
off
the
marriage
then
she
related
her
last
interview
with
ibarra
omitting
the
reference
to
her
birth
father
dámaso
could
scarcely
believe
what
he
heard
while
he
lived
continued
the
maiden
i
intended
to
fight
to
wait
to
trust
i
wanted
to
live
to
hear
him
spoken
of
but
now
that
they
have
killed
him
now
there
is
no
reason
for
my
living
and
suffering
she
said
this
slowly
in
a
low
voice
calmly
and
without
a
tear
but
you
goose
is
linares
a
thousand
times
better
than
when
he
was
living
i
could
have
married
i
was
thinking
of
fleeing
afterward
my
father
wanted
nothing
more
than
the
relative
now
that
he
is
dead
no
other
man
will
call
me
his
wife
while
he
lived
i
could
have
debased
myself
and
still
had
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
he
existed
and
perhaps
was
thinking
of
me
now
that
he
is
dead
the
convent
or
the
tomb
her
voice
had
a
firmness
in
its
accent
which
took
away
father
joy
and
set
him
to
thinking
did
you
love
him
so
much
as
that
he
asked
stammering
maria
clara
did
not
reply
father
dámaso
bowed
his
head
upon
his
breast
and
remained
silent
my
child
he
exclaimed
his
voice
breaking
forgive
me
for
making
you
unhappy
without
knowing
it
i
was
thinking
of
your
future
i
wanted
you
to
be
happy
how
could
i
permit
you
to
marry
a
native
how
could
i
see
you
an
unhappy
wife
and
a
miserable
mother
i
could
not
get
your
love
out
of
your
head
and
i
opposed
it
with
all
my
strength
all
that
i
have
done
has
been
for
you
for
you
alone
if
you
had
become
his
wife
you
would
have
wept
afterward
on
account
of
the
condition
of
your
husband
exposed
to
all
kinds
of
vengeance
without
any
means
of
defense
as
a
mother
you
would
have
wept
over
the
fortune
of
your
sons
if
you
educated
them
you
would
prepare
a
sad
future
for
them
you
would
have
made
them
enemies
of
the
church
and
would
have
seen
them
hanged
or
exiled
if
you
left
them
ignorant
you
would
have
seen
them
oppressed
and
degraded
i
could
not
consent
to
it
this
is
why
i
sought
as
a
husband
for
you
one
who
might
make
you
the
happy
mother
of
sons
born
not
to
obey
but
to
command
not
to
suffer
but
to
punish
i
knew
that
your
friend
was
good
from
infancy
i
liked
him
as
i
had
liked
his
father
but
i
hated
them
both
when
i
saw
that
they
were
going
to
make
you
unhappy
because
i
love
you
i
idolize
you
i
love
you
as
my
daughter
i
have
nothing
dearer
than
you
i
have
seen
you
grow
no
hour
passes
but
i
think
of
you
i
dream
of
you
you
are
my
only
joy
and
father
dámaso
began
to
weep
like
a
child
well
then
if
you
love
me
do
not
make
me
eternally
unhappy
he
no
longer
lives
i
want
to
be
a
nun
the
old
man
rested
his
head
on
his
hand
to
be
a
nun
to
be
a
nun
he
repeated
you
do
not
know
my
child
the
life
the
misery
which
is
hidden
behind
the
walls
of
the
convent
you
do
not
know
it
i
prefer
a
thousand
times
to
see
you
unhappy
in
the
world
than
to
see
you
unhappy
in
the
cloister
here
your
complaints
can
be
heard
there
you
will
have
only
the
walls
you
are
beautiful
very
beautiful
and
you
were
not
born
for
it
you
were
not
born
to
be
the
bride
of
christ
believe
me
my
child
time
will
blot
it
all
out
later
you
will
forget
you
will
love
your
husband
linares
either
the
convent
or
death
repeated
maria
clara
the
convent
the
convent
or
death
exclaimed
father
dámaso
maria
i
am
already
old
i
will
not
be
able
to
watch
you
or
your
happiness
much
longer
choose
another
course
seek
another
love
another
young
man
whoever
he
may
