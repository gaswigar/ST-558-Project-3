was

the
crescent
taramis
queen
of
khauran
awakened
from
a
slumber
to
a
silence
that
seemed
more
like
the
stillness
of
nighted
catacombs
than
the
normal
quiet
of
a
sleeping
place
she
lay
staring
into
the
darkness
wondering
why
the
candles
in
their
golden
candelabra
had
gone
out
a
flecking
of
stars
marked
a
casement
that
lent
no
illumination
to
the
interior
of
the
chamber
but
as
taramis
lay
there
she
became
aware
of
a
spot
of
radiance
glowing
in
the
darkness
before
her
she
watched
puzzled
it
grew
and
its
intensity
deepened
as
it
expanded
a
widening
disk
of
lurid
light
hovering
against
the
dark
velvet
hangings
of
the
opposite
wall
taramis
caught
her
breath
starting
up
to
a
sitting
position
a
dark
object
was
visible
in
that
circle
of
light
human
in
a
sudden
panic
the
queen
opened
her
lips
to
cry
out
for
her
maids
then
she
checked
herself
the
glow
was
more
lurid
the
head
more
vividly
limned
it
was
a
woman
head
small
delicately
molded
superbly
poised
with
a
mass
of
lustrous
black
hair
the
face
grew
distinct
as
she
stared
and
it
was
the
sight
of
this
face
which
froze
the
cry
in
taramis
throat
the
features
were
her
own
she
might
have
been
looking
into
a
mirror
which
subtly
altered
her
reflection
lending
it
a
tigerish
gleam
of
eye
a
vindictive
curl
of
lip
gasped
taramis
am
bewitched
appallingly
the
apparition
spoke
and
its
voice
was
like
honeyed
venom
no
sweet
sister
here
is
no
sorcery
stammered
the
bewildered
girl
have
no
sister
never
had
a
sister
came
the
sweet
poisonously
mocking
voice
a
twin
sister
whose
flesh
was
as
soft
as
yours
to
caress
or
hurt
once
i
had
a
sister
answered
taramis
still
convinced
that
she
was
in
the
grip
of
some
sort
of
nightmare
she
died
the
beautiful
face
in
the
disk
was
convulsed
with
the
aspect
of
a
fury
so
hellish
became
its
expression
that
taramis
cowering
back
half
expected
to
see
snaky
locks
writhe
hissing
about
the
ivory
brow
lie
the
accusation
was
spat
from
between
the
snarling
red
lips
did
not
die
fool
oh
enough
of
this
mummery
look
and
let
your
sight
be
blasted
light
ran
suddenly
along
the
hangings
like
flaming
serpents
and
incredibly
the
candles
in
the
golden
sticks
flared
up
again
taramis
crouched
on
her
velvet
couch
her
lithe
legs
flexed
beneath
her
staring
at
the
pantherish
figure
which
posed
mockingly
before
her
it
was
as
if
she
gazed
upon
another
taramis
identical
with
herself
in
every
contour
of
feature
and
limb
yet
animated
by
an
alien
and
evil
personality
the
face
of
this
stranger
waif
reflected
the
opposite
of
every
characteristic
the
countenance
of
the
queen
denoted
lust
and
mystery
sparkled
in
her
scintillant
eyes
cruelty
lurked
in
the
curl
of
her
full
red
lips
each
movement
of
her
supple
body
was
subtly
suggestive
her
coiffure
imitated
that
of
the
queen
on
her
feet
were
gilded
sandals
such
as
taramis
wore
in
her
boudoir
the
sleeveless
silk
tunic
girdled
at
the
waist
with
a
cincture
was
a
duplicate
of
the
queen
are
you
gasped
taramis
an
icy
chill
she
could
not
explain
creeping
along
her
spine
your
presence
before
i
call
my
to
summon
the
guard
until
the
roof
beams
crack
callously
answered
the
stranger
sluts
will
not
wake
till
dawn
though
the
palace
spring
into
flames
about
them
your
guardsmen
will
not
hear
your
squeals
they
have
been
sent
out
of
this
wing
of
the
palace
exclaimed
taramis
stiffening
with
outraged
majesty
dared
give
my
guardsmen
such
a
command
did
sweet
sister
sneered
the
other
girl
little
while
ago
before
i
entered
they
thought
it
was
their
darling
adored
queen
ha
how
beautifully
i
acted
the
part
with
what
imperious
dignity
softened
by
womanly
sweetness
did
i
address
the
great
louts
who
knelt
in
their
armor
and
plumed
helmets
taramis
felt
as
if
a
stifling
net
of
bewilderment
were
being
drawn
about
her
are
you
she
cried
desperately
madness
is
this
why
do
you
come
here
am
i
there
was
the
spite
of
a
hiss
in
the
soft
response
the
girl
stepped
to
the
edge
of
the
couch
grasped
the
white
shoulders
with
fierce
fingers
and
bent
to
glare
full
into
the
startled
eyes
of
taramis
and
under
the
spell
of
that
hypnotic
glare
the
queen
forgot
to
resent
the
unprecedented
outrage
of
violent
hands
laid
on
regal
flesh
gritted
the
girl
between
her
teeth
you
ask
can
you
wonder
i
am
salome
taramis
breathed
the
word
and
the
hairs
prickled
on
her
scalp
as
she
realized
the
incredible
numbing
truth
of
the
statement
thought
you
died
within
the
hour
of
your
birth
she
said
feebly
thought
many
answered
the
woman
who
called
herself
salome
carried
me
into
the
desert
to
die
damn
them
i
a
mewing
puling
babe
whose
life
was
so
young
it
was
scarcely
the
flicker
of
a
candle
and
do
you
know
why
they
bore
me
forth
to
die
i
have
heard
the
story
faltered
taramis
salome
laughed
fiercely
and
slapped
her
bosom
the
tunic
left
the
upper
parts
of
her
firm
breasts
bare
and
between
them
there
shone
a
curious
mark
a
crescent
red
as
blood
mark
of
the
witch
cried
taramis
recoiling
salome
laughter
was
with
hate
curse
of
the
kings
of
khauran
aye
they
tell
the
tale
in
the
with
wagging
beards
and
rolling
eyes
the
pious
fools
they
tell
how
the
first
queen
of
our
line
had
traffic
with
a
fiend
of
darkness
and
bore
him
a
daughter
who
lives
in
foul
legendry
to
this
day
and
thereafter
in
each
century
a
girl
baby
was
born
into
the
askhaurian
dynasty
with
a
scarlet
between
her
breasts
that
signified
her
destiny
every
century
a
witch
shall
be
born
so
ran
the
ancient
curse
and
so
it
has
come
to
pass
some
were
slain
at
birth
as
they
sought
to
slay
me
some
walked
the
earth
as
witches
proud
daughters
of
khauran
with
the
moon
of
hell
burning
upon
their
ivory
bosoms
each
was
named
salome
i
too
am
salome
it
was
always
salome
the
witch
it
will
always
be
salome
the
witch
even
when
the
mountains
of
ice
have
roared
down
from
the
pole
and
ground
the
civilizations
to
ruin
and
a
new
world
has
risen
from
the
ashes
and
dust
even
then
there
shall
be
salomes
to
walk
the
earth
to
trap
men
hearts
by
their
sorcery
to
dance
before
the
kings
of
the
world
to
see
the
heads
of
the
wise
men
fall
at
their
pleasure
but
you
stammered
taramis
the
scintillant
eyes
burned
like
dark
fires
of
mystery
carried
me
into
the
desert
far
from
the
city
and
laid
me
naked
on
the
hot
sand
under
the
flaming
sun
and
then
they
rode
away
and
left
me
for
the
jackals
and
the
vultures
and
the
desert
wolves
the
life
in
me
was
stronger
than
the
life
in
common
folk
for
it
partakes
of
the
essence
of
the
forces
that
seethe
in
the
black
gulfs
beyond
mortal
ken
the
hours
passed
and
the
sun
slashed
down
like
the
molten
flames
of
hell
but
i
did
not
die
aye
something
of
that
torment
i
remember
faintly
and
far
away
as
one
remembers
a
dim
formless
dream
then
there
were
camels
and
men
who
wore
silk
robes
and
spoke
in
a
weird
tongue
strayed
from
the
caravan
road
they
passed
close
by
and
their
leader
saw
me
and
recognized
the
scarlet
crescent
on
my
bosom
he
took
me
up
and
gave
me
life
was
a
magician
from
far
khitai
returning
to
his
native
kingdom
after
a
journey
to
stygia
he
took
me
with
him
to
paikang
its
minarets
rising
amid
the
jungles
of
bamboo
and
there
i
grew
to
womanhood
under
his
teaching
age
had
steeped
him
deep
in
black
wisdom
not
weakened
his
powers
of
evil
many
things
he
taught
me
she
paused
smiling
enigmatically
with
wicked
mystery
gleaming
in
her
dark
eyes
then
she
tossed
her
head
drove
me
from
him
at
last
saying
that
i
was
but
a
common
witch
in
spite
of
his
teachings
and
not
fit
to
command
the
mighty
sorcery
he
would
have
taught
me
he
would
have
made
me
queen
of
the
world
and
ruled
the
nations
through
me
he
said
but
i
was
only
a
harlot
of
darkness
but
what
of
it
i
could
never
endure
to
seclude
myself
in
a
golden
tower
and
spend
the
long
hours
staring
into
a
crystal
globe
mumbling
over
incantations
written
on
serpent
skin
in
the
blood
of
virgins
poring
over
musty
volumes
in
forgotten
languages
said
i
was
but
an
earthly
sprite
knowing
naught
of
the
deeper
gulfs
of
cosmic
sorcery
well
this
world
contains
all
i
desire
power
and
pomp
and
glittering
pageantry
handsome
men
and
soft
women
for
my
paramours
and
my
slaves
he
had
told
me
who
i
was
of
the
curse
and
my
heritage
i
have
returned
to
take
that
to
which
i
have
as
much
right
as
you
now
it
is
mine
by
right
of
possession
do
you
mean
taramis
sprang
up
and
faced
her
sister
stung
out
of
her
bewilderment
and
fright
you
imagine
that
by
drugging
a
few
of
my
maids
and
tricking
a
few
of
my
guardsmen
you
have
established
a
claim
to
the
throne
of
khauran
do
not
forget
that
i
am
queen
of
khauran
i
shall
give
you
a
place
of
honor
as
my
sister
but
salome
laughed
hatefully
generous
of
you
dear
sweet
sister
but
before
you
begin
putting
me
in
my
place
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
whose
soldiers
camp
in
the
plain
outside
the
city
walls
are
the
shemitish
mercenaries
of
constantius
the
kothic
of
the
free
companies
what
do
they
in
khauran
cooed
salome
taramis
felt
that
she
was
being
subtly
mocked
but
she
answered
with
an
assumption
of
dignity
which
she
scarcely
felt
asked
permission
to
pass
along
the
borders
of
khauran
on
his
way
to
turan
he
himself
is
hostage
for
their
good
behavior
as
long
as
they
are
within
my
domains
constantius
pursued
salome
he
not
ask
your
hand
today
taramis
shot
her
a
clouded
glance
of
suspicion
did
you
know
that
an
insolent
shrug
of
the
slim
naked
shoulders
was
the
only
reply
refused
dear
sister
i
refused
exclaimed
taramis
angrily
you
an
askhaurian
princess
yourself
suppose
that
the
queen
of
khauran
could
treat
such
a
proposal
with
anything
but
disdain
wed
a
adventurer
a
man
exiled
from
his
own
kingdom
because
of
his
crimes
and
the
leader
of
organized
plunderers
and
hired
murderers
should
never
have
allowed
him
to
bring
his
slayers
into
khauran
but
he
is
virtually
a
prisoner
in
the
south
tower
guarded
by
my
soldiers
tomorrow
i
shall
bid
him
order
his
troops
to
leave
the
kingdom
he
himself
shall
be
kept
captive
until
they
are
over
the
border
meantime
my
soldiers
man
the
walls
of
the
city
and
i
have
warned
him
that
he
will
answer
for
any
outrages
perpetrated
on
the
villagers
or
shepherds
by
his
mercenaries
is
confined
in
the
south
tower
asked
salome
is
what
i
said
why
do
you
ask
for
answer
salome
clapped
her
hands
and
lifting
her
voice
with
a
gurgle
of
cruel
mirth
in
it
called
queen
grants
you
an
audience
falcon
a
door
opened
and
a
tall
figure
entered
the
chamber
at
the
sight
of
which
taramis
cried
out
in
amazement
and
anger
you
dare
enter
my
chamber
you
see
your
majesty
he
bent
his
dark
head
in
mock
humility
constantius
whom
men
called
falcon
was
tall
lithe
and
strong
as
pliant
steel
he
was
handsome
in
an
aquiline
ruthless
way
his
face
was
burnt
dark
by
the
sun
and
his
hair
which
grew
far
back
from
his
high
narrow
forehead
was
black
as
a
raven
his
dark
eyes
were
penetrating
and
alert
the
hardness
of
his
thin
lips
not
softened
by
his
thin
black
mustache
his
boots
were
of
kordavan
leather
his
hose
and
doublet
of
plain
dark
silk
tarnished
with
the
wear
of
the
camps
and
the
stains
of
armor
rust
twisting
his
mustache
he
let
his
gaze
travel
up
and
down
the
shrinking
queen
with
an
effrontery
that
made
her
wince
ishtar
taramis
he
said
silkily
find
you
more
alluring
in
your
than
in
your
queenly
robes
truly
this
is
an
auspicious
night
fear
grew
in
the
queen
dark
eyes
she
was
no
fool
she
knew
that
constantius
would
never
dare
this
outrage
unless
he
was
sure
of
himself
are
mad
she
said
i
am
in
your
power
in
this
chamber
you
are
no
less
in
the
power
of
my
subjects
who
will
rend
you
to
pieces
if
you
touch
me
go
at
once
if
you
would
live
both
laughed
mockingly
and
salome
made
an
impatient
gesture
of
this
farce
let
us
on
to
the
next
act
in
the
comedy
listen
dear
sister
it
was
i
who
sent
constantius
here
when
i
decided
to
take
the
throne
of
khauran
i
cast
about
for
a
man
to
aid
me
and
chose
the
falcon
because
of
his
utter
lack
of
all
characteristics
men
call
good
am
overwhelmed
princess
murmured
constantius
sardonically
with
a
profound
bow
sent
him
to
khauran
and
once
his
men
were
camped
in
the
plain
outside
and
he
was
in
the
palace
i
entered
the
city
by
that
small
gate
in
the
west
wall
the
fools
guarding
it
thought
it
was
you
returning
from
some
nocturnal
adventure
taramis
cheeks
flamed
and
her
resentment
got
the
better
of
her
regal
reserve
salome
smiled
hardly
were
properly
surprised
and
shocked
but
admitted
me
without
question
i
entered
the
palace
the
same
way
and
gave
the
order
to
the
surprised
guards
that
sent
them
marching
away
as
well
as
the
men
who
guarded
constantius
in
the
south
tower
then
i
came
here
attending
to
the
on
the
way
taramis
fingers
clenched
and
she
paled
what
next
she
asked
in
a
shaky
voice
salome
inclined
her
head
faintly
through
the
casement
there
came
the
clank
of
marching
men
in
armor
gruff
voices
shouted
in
an
alien
tongue
and
cries
of
alarm
mingled
with
the
shouts
people
awaken
and
grow
fearful
said
constantius
sardonically
had
better
go
and
reassure
them
salome
me
taramis
answered
salome
must
become
accustomed
to
it
have
you
done
cried
taramis
have
you
done
have
gone
to
the
gates
and
ordered
the
soldiers
to
open
them
answered
salome
were
astounded
but
they
obeyed
that
is
the
falcon
army
you
hear
marching
into
the
city
devil
cried
taramis
have
betrayed
my
people
in
my
guise
you
have
made
me
seem
a
traitor
oh
i
shall
go
to
them
with
a
cruel
laugh
salome
caught
her
wrist
and
jerked
her
back
the
magnificent
suppleness
of
the
queen
was
helpless
against
the
vindictive
strength
that
steeled
salome
slender
limbs
know
how
to
reach
the
dungeons
from
the
palace
constantius
said
the
take
this
spitfire
and
lock
her
into
the
strongest
cell
the
jailers
are
all
sound
in
drugged
sleep
i
saw
to
that
send
a
man
to
cut
their
throats
before
they
can
awaken
none
must
ever
know
what
has
occurred
tonight
thenceforward
i
am
taramis
and
taramis
is
a
nameless
prisoner
in
an
unknown
dungeon
constantius
smiled
with
a
glint
of
strong
white
teeth
under
his
thin
mustache
good
but
you
would
not
deny
me
a
little
ah
amusement
first
i
tame
the
scornful
hussy
as
you
will
with
a
wicked
laugh
salome
flung
her
sister
into
the
kothian
arms
and
turned
away
through
the
door
that
opened
into
the
outer
corridor
fright
widened
taramis
lovely
eyes
her
supple
figure
rigid
and
straining
against
constantius
embrace
she
forgot
the
men
marching
in
the
streets
forgot
the
outrage
to
her
queenship
in
the
face
of
the
menace
to
her
womanhood
she
forgot
all
sensations
but
terror
and
shame
as
she
faced
the
complete
cynicism
of
constantius
burning
mocking
eyes
felt
his
hard
arms
crushing
her
writhing
body
salome
hurrying
along
the
corridor
outside
smiled
spitefully
as
a
scream
of
despair
and
agony
rang
shuddering
through
the
palace
the
tree
of
death
the
young
soldier
hose
and
shirt
were
smeared
with
dried
blood
wet
with
sweat
and
gray
with
dust
blood
oozed
from
the
deep
gash
in
his
thigh
from
the
cuts
on
his
breast
and
shoulder
perspiration
glistened
on
his
livid
face
and
his
fingers
were
knotted
in
the
cover
of
the
divan
on
which
he
lay
yet
his
words
reflected
mental
suffering
that
outweighed
physical
pain
must
be
mad
he
repeated
again
and
again
like
one
still
stunned
by
some
monstrous
and
incredible
happening
like
a
nightmare
taramis
whom
all
khauran
loves
betraying
her
people
to
that
devil
from
koth
oh
ishtar
why
was
i
not
slain
better
die
than
live
to
see
our
queen
turn
traitor
and
harlot
still
valerius
begged
the
girl
who
was
washing
and
bandaging
his
wounds
with
trembling
hands
please
lie
still
darling
you
will
make
your
wounds
worse
i
dared
not
summon
a
leech
muttered
the
wounded
youth
devils
will
be
searching
the
quarters
for
wounded
khaurani
they
hang
every
man
who
has
wounds
to
show
he
fought
against
them
oh
taramis
how
could
you
betray
the
people
who
worshipped
you
in
his
fierce
agony
he
writhed
weeping
in
rage
and
shame
and
the
terrified
girl
caught
him
in
her
arms
straining
his
tossing
head
against
her
bosom
imploring
him
to
be
quiet
death
than
the
black
shame
that
has
come
upon
khauran
this
day
he
groaned
you
see
it
ivga
valerius
her
soft
nimble
fingers
were
again
at
work
gently
cleansing
and
closing
the
gaping
edges
of
his
raw
wounds
was
awakened
by
the
noise
of
fighting
in
the
streets
i
looked
out
a
casement
and
saw
the
shemites
cutting
down
people
then
presently
i
heard
you
calling
me
faintly
from
the
alley
door
had
reached
the
limits
of
my
strength
he
muttered
fell
in
the
alley
and
could
not
rise
i
knew
they
find
me
soon
if
i
lay
there
i
killed
three
of
the
beasts
by
ishtar
they
never
swagger
through
khauran
streets
by
the
gods
the
fiends
are
tearing
their
hearts
in
hell
the
trembling
girl
crooned
soothingly
to
him
as
to
a
wounded
child
and
closed
his
panting
lips
with
her
own
cool
sweet
mouth
but
the
fire
that
raged
in
his
soul
would
not
allow
him
to
lie
silent
was
not
on
the
wall
when
the
shemites
entered
he
burst
out
was
asleep
in
the
barracks
with
the
others
not
on
duty
it
was
just
before
dawn
when
our
captain
entered
and
his
face
was
pale
under
his
helmet
the
shemites
are
in
the
city
he
said
the
queen
came
to
the
southern
gate
and
gave
orders
that
they
should
be
admitted
she
made
the
men
come
down
from
the
walls
where
they
been
on
guard
since
constantius
entered
the
kingdom
i
do
understand
it
and
neither
does
anyone
else
but
i
heard
her
give
the
order
and
we
obeyed
as
we
always
do
we
are
ordered
to
assemble
in
the
square
before
the
palace
form
ranks
outside
the
barracks
and
march
leave
your
arms
and
armor
here
ishtar
knows
what
this
means
but
it
is
the
queen
order
when
we
came
to
the
square
the
shemites
were
drawn
up
on
foot
opposite
the
palace
ten
thousand
of
the
devils
fully
armed
and
people
heads
were
thrust
out
of
every
window
and
door
on
the
square
the
streets
leading
into
the
square
were
thronged
by
bewildered
folk
taramis
was
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
palace
alone
except
for
constantius
who
stood
stroking
his
mustache
like
a
great
lean
cat
who
has
just
devoured
a
sparrow
but
fifty
shemites
with
bows
in
their
hands
were
ranged
below
them
where
the
queen
guard
should
have
been
but
they
were
drawn
up
at
the
foot
of
the
palace
stair
as
puzzled
as
we
though
they
had
come
fully
armed
in
spite
of
the
queen
order
spoke
to
us
then
and
told
us
that
she
had
reconsidered
the
proposal
made
her
by
constantius
why
only
yesterday
she
threw
it
in
his
teeth
in
open
court
and
that
she
had
decided
to
make
him
her
royal
consort
she
did
not
explain
why
she
had
brought
the
shemites
into
the
city
so
treacherously
but
she
said
that
as
constantius
had
control
of
a
body
of
professional
the
army
of
khauran
would
no
longer
be
needed
and
therefore
she
disbanded
it
and
ordered
us
to
go
quietly
to
our
homes
obedience
to
our
queen
is
second
nature
to
us
but
we
were
struck
dumb
and
found
no
word
to
answer
we
broke
ranks
almost
before
we
knew
what
we
were
doing
like
men
in
a
daze
when
the
palace
guard
was
ordered
to
disarm
likewise
and
disband
the
captain
of
the
guard
conan
interrupted
men
said
he
was
off
duty
the
night
before
and
drunk
but
he
was
wide
awake
now
he
shouted
to
the
guardsmen
to
stand
as
they
were
until
they
received
an
order
from
him
and
such
is
his
dominance
of
his
men
that
they
obeyed
in
spite
of
the
queen
he
strode
up
to
the
palace
steps
and
glared
at
taramis
and
then
he
roared
this
is
not
the
queen
this
is
taramis
it
some
devil
in
masquerade
hell
was
to
pay
i
do
know
just
what
happened
i
think
a
shemite
struck
conan
and
conan
killed
him
the
next
instant
the
square
was
a
battleground
the
shemites
fell
on
the
guardsmen
and
their
spears
and
arrows
struck
down
many
soldiers
who
had
already
disbanded
of
us
grabbed
up
such
weapons
as
we
could
and
fought
back
we
hardly
knew
what
we
were
fighting
for
but
it
was
against
constantius
and
his
devils
not
against
taramis
i
swear
it
constantius
shouted
to
cut
the
traitors
down
we
were
not
traitors
despair
and
bewilderment
shook
his
voice
the
girl
murmured
pityingly
not
understanding
it
all
but
aching
in
sympathy
with
her
lover
suffering
people
did
not
know
which
side
to
take
it
was
a
madhouse
of
confusion
and
bewilderment
we
who
fought
did
have
a
chance
in
no
formation
without
armor
and
only
half
armed
the
guards
were
fully
armed
and
drawn
up
in
a
square
but
there
were
only
five
hundred
of
them
they
took
a
heavy
toll
before
they
were
cut
down
but
there
could
be
only
one
conclusion
to
such
a
battle
and
while
her
people
were
being
slaughtered
before
her
taramis
stood
on
the
palace
steps
with
constantius
arm
about
her
waist
and
laughed
like
a
heartless
beautiful
fiend
gods
it
all
mad
mad
never
saw
a
man
fight
as
conan
fought
he
put
his
back
to
the
courtyard
wall
and
before
they
overpowered
him
the
dead
men
were
strewn
in
heaps
about
him
but
at
last
they
dragged
him
down
a
hundred
against
one
when
i
saw
him
fall
i
dragged
myself
away
feeling
as
if
the
world
had
burst
under
my
very
fingers
i
heard
constantius
call
to
his
dogs
to
take
the
captain
alive
stroking
his
mustache
with
that
hateful
smile
on
his
lips
that
smile
was
on
the
lips
of
constantius
at
that
very
moment
he
sat
his
horse
among
a
cluster
of
his
men
shemites
with
curled
beards
and
hooked
noses
the
sun
struck
glints
from
their
peaked
helmets
and
the
silvered
scales
of
their
corselets
nearly
a
mile
behind
the
walls
and
towers
of
khauran
rose
sheer
out
of
the
meadowlands
by
the
side
of
the
caravan
road
a
heavy
cross
had
been
planted
and
on
this
grim
tree
a
man
hung
nailed
there
by
iron
spikes
through
his
hands
and
feet
naked
but
for
a
the
man
was
almost
a
giant
in
stature
and
his
muscles
stood
out
in
thick
corded
ridges
on
limbs
and
body
which
the
sun
had
long
ago
burned
brown
the
perspiration
of
agony
beaded
his
face
and
his
mighty
breast
but
from
under
the
tangled
black
mane
that
fell
over
his
low
broad
forehead
his
blue
eyes
blazed
with
an
unquenched
fire
blood
oozed
sluggishly
from
the
lacerations
in
his
hands
and
feet
constantius
saluted
him
mockingly
am
sorry
captain
he
said
i
can
not
remain
to
ease
your
last
hours
but
i
have
duties
to
perform
in
yonder
city
i
must
not
keep
your
delicious
queen
waiting
he
laughed
softly
i
leave
you
to
your
own
devices
and
those
beauties
he
pointed
meaningly
at
the
black
shadows
which
swept
incessantly
back
and
forth
high
above
it
not
for
them
i
imagine
that
a
powerful
brute
like
yourself
should
live
on
the
cross
for
days
do
not
cherish
any
illusions
of
rescue
because
i
am
leaving
you
unguarded
i
have
had
it
proclaimed
that
anyone
seeking
to
take
your
body
living
or
dead
from
the
cross
will
be
flayed
alive
together
with
all
the
members
of
his
family
in
the
public
square
i
am
so
firmly
established
in
khauran
that
my
order
is
as
good
as
a
regiment
of
guardsmen
i
am
leaving
no
guard
because
the
vultures
will
not
approach
as
long
as
anyone
is
near
and
i
do
not
wish
them
to
feel
any
constraint
that
is
also
why
i
brought
you
so
far
from
the
city
these
desert
vultures
approach
the
walls
no
closer
than
this
spot
so
brave
captain
farewell
i
will
remember
you
when
in
an
hour
taramis
lies
in
my
arms
blood
started
afresh
from
the
pierced
palms
as
the
victim
fists
clenched
convulsively
on
the
knots
and
bunches
of
muscle
started
out
of
the
massive
arms
and
conan
beat
his
head
forward
and
spat
savagely
at
constantius
face
the
laughed
coolly
wiped
the
saliva
from
his
gorget
and
reined
his
horse
about
me
when
the
vultures
are
tearing
at
your
living
flesh
he
called
mockingly
desert
scavengers
are
a
particularly
voracious
breed
i
have
seen
men
hang
for
hours
on
a
cross
eyeless
earless
and
scalpless
before
the
sharp
beaks
had
eaten
their
way
into
their
vitals
without
a
backward
glance
he
rode
toward
the
city
a
supple
erect
figure
gleaming
in
his
burnished
armor
his
stolid
bearded
henchmen
jogging
beside
him
a
faint
rising
of
dust
from
the
worn
trail
marked
their
passing
the
man
hanging
on
the
cross
was
the
one
touch
of
sentient
life
in
a
landscape
that
seemed
desolate
and
deserted
in
the
late
evening
khauran
less
than
a
mile
away
might
have
been
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
existing
in
another
age
shaking
the
sweat
out
of
his
eyes
conan
stared
blankly
at
the
familiar
terrain
on
either
side
of
the
city
and
beyond
it
stretched
the
fertile
meadowlands
with
cattle
browsing
in
the
distance
where
fields
and
vineyards
checkered
the
plain
the
western
and
northern
horizons
were
dotted
with
villages
miniature
in
the
distance
a
lesser
distance
to
the
southeast
a
silvery
gleam
marked
the
course
of
a
river
and
beyond
that
river
sandy
desert
began
abruptly
to
stretch
away
and
away
beyond
the
horizon
conan
stared
at
that
expanse
of
empty
waste
shimmering
tawnily
in
the
late
sunlight
as
a
trapped
hawk
stares
at
the
open
sky
a
revulsion
shook
him
when
he
glanced
at
the
gleaming
towers
of
khauran
the
city
had
betrayed
him
trapped
him
into
circumstances
that
left
him
hanging
to
a
wooden
cross
like
a
hare
nailed
to
a
tree
a
red
lust
for
vengeance
swept
away
the
thought
curses
ebbed
fitfully
from
the
man
lips
all
his
universe
contracted
focused
became
incorporated
in
the
four
iron
spikes
that
held
him
from
life
and
freedom
his
great
muscles
quivered
knotting
like
iron
cables
with
the
sweat
starting
out
on
his
graying
skin
he
sought
to
gain
leverage
to
tear
the
nails
from
the
wood
it
was
useless
they
had
been
driven
deep
then
he
tried
to
tear
his
hands
off
the
spikes
and
it
was
not
the
knifing
abysmal
agony
that
finally
caused
him
to
cease
his
efforts
but
the
futility
of
it
the
were
broad
and
heavy
he
could
not
drag
them
through
the
wounds
a
surge
of
helplessness
shook
the
giant
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
hung
motionless
his
head
resting
on
his
breast
shutting
his
eyes
against
the
aching
glare
of
the
sun
a
beat
of
wings
caused
him
to
look
just
as
a
feathered
shadow
shot
down
out
of
the
sky
a
keen
beak
stabbing
at
his
eyes
cut
his
cheek
and
he
jerked
his
head
aside
shutting
his
eyes
involuntarily
he
shouted
a
croaking
desperate
shout
of
menace
and
the
vultures
swerved
away
and
retreated
frightened
by
the
sound
they
resumed
their
wary
circling
above
his
head
blood
trickled
over
conan
mouth
and
he
licked
his
lips
involuntarily
spat
at
the
salty
taste
thirst
assailed
him
savagely
he
had
drunk
deeply
of
wine
the
night
before
and
no
water
had
touched
his
lips
since
before
the
battle
in
the
square
that
dawn
and
killing
was
thirsty
work
he
glared
at
the
distant
river
as
a
man
in
hell
glares
through
the
opened
grille
he
thought
of
gushing
freshets
of
white
water
he
had
breasted
laved
to
the
shoulders
in
liquid
jade
he
remembered
great
horns
of
foaming
ale
jacks
of
sparkling
wine
gulped
carelessly
or
spilled
on
the
tavern
floor
he
bit
his
lip
to
keep
from
bellowing
in
intolerable
anguish
as
a
tortured
animal
bellows
the
sun
sank
a
lurid
ball
in
a
fiery
sea
of
blood
against
a
crimson
rampart
that
banded
the
horizon
the
towers
of
the
city
floated
unreal
as
a
dream
the
very
sky
was
tinged
with
blood
to
his
misted
glare
he
licked
his
blackened
lips
and
stared
with
bloodshot
eyes
at
the
distant
river
it
too
seemed
crimson
with
blood
and
the
shadows
crawling
up
from
the
east
seemed
black
as
ebony
in
his
dulled
ears
sounded
the
louder
beat
of
wings
lifting
his
head
he
watched
with
the
burning
glare
of
a
wolf
the
shadows
wheeling
above
him
he
knew
that
his
shouts
would
frighten
them
away
no
longer
one
dipped
dipped
lower
and
lower
conan
drew
his
head
back
as
far
as
he
could
waiting
with
terrible
patience
the
vulture
swept
in
with
a
swift
roar
of
wings
its
beak
flashed
down
ripping
the
skin
on
conan
chin
as
he
jerked
his
head
aside
then
before
the
bird
could
flash
away
conan
head
lunged
forward
on
his
mighty
neck
muscles
and
his
teeth
snapping
like
those
of
a
wolf
locked
on
the
bare
wattled
neck
instantly
the
vulture
exploded
into
squawking
flapping
hysteria
its
thrashing
wings
blinded
the
man
and
its
talons
ripped
his
chest
but
grimly
he
hung
on
the
muscles
starting
out
in
lumps
on
his
jaws
and
the
scavenger
crunched
between
those
powerful
teeth
with
a
spasmodic
flutter
the
bird
hung
limp
conan
let
go
spat
blood
from
his
mouth
the
other
vultures
terrified
by
the
fate
of
their
companion
were
in
full
flight
to
a
distant
tree
where
they
perched
like
black
demons
in
conclave
ferocious
triumph
surged
through
conan
numbed
brain
life
beat
strongly
and
savagely
through
his
veins
he
could
still
deal
death
he
still
lived
every
twinge
of
sensation
even
of
agony
was
a
negation
of
death
mitra
either
a
voice
spoke
or
he
suffered
from
hallucination
all
my
life
i
have
never
seen
such
a
thing
shaking
the
sweat
and
blood
from
his
eyes
conan
saw
four
horsemen
sitting
their
steeds
in
the
twilight
and
staring
up
at
him
three
were
lean
hawks
zuagir
tribesmen
without
a
doubt
nomads
from
beyond
the
river
the
other
was
dressed
like
them
in
a
white
girdled
and
a
flowing
which
banded
about
the
temples
with
a
triple
circlet
of
braided
fell
to
his
shoulders
but
he
was
not
a
shemite
the
dust
was
not
so
thick
nor
conan
sight
so
clouded
that
he
could
not
perceive
the
man
facial
characteristics
he
was
as
tall
as
conan
though
not
so
his
shoulders
were
broad
and
his
supple
figure
was
hard
as
steel
and
whalebone
a
short
black
beard
did
not
altogether
mask
the
aggressive
jut
of
his
lean
jaw
and
gray
eyes
cold
and
piercing
as
a
sword
gleamed
from
the
shadow
of
the
quieting
his
restless
steed
with
a
quick
sure
hand
this
man
spoke
mitra
i
should
know
this
man
it
was
the
guttural
accents
of
a
zuagir
is
the
cimmerian
who
was
captain
of
the
queen
guard
must
be
casting
off
all
her
old
favorites
muttered
the
rider
have
ever
thought
it
of
queen
taramis
i
rather
have
had
a
long
bloody
war
it
would
have
given
us
desert
folk
a
chance
to
plunder
as
it
is
we
come
this
close
to
the
walls
and
found
only
this
nag
he
glanced
at
a
fine
gelding
led
by
one
of
the
nomads
this
dying
dog
conan
lifted
his
bloody
head
i
could
come
down
from
this
beam
i
make
a
dying
dog
out
of
you
you
zaporoskan
thief
he
rasped
through
blackened
lips
the
knave
knows
me
exclaimed
the
other
knave
do
you
know
me
only
one
of
your
breed
in
these
parts
muttered
conan
are
olgerd
vladislav
the
outlaw
chief
and
once
a
hetman
of
the
of
the
zaporoskan
river
as
you
have
guessed
would
you
like
to
live
a
fool
would
ask
that
question
panted
conan
am
a
hard
man
said
olgerd
toughness
is
the
only
quality
i
respect
in
a
man
i
shall
judge
if
you
are
a
man
or
only
a
dog
after
all
fit
only
to
lie
here
and
die
we
cut
him
down
we
may
be
seen
from
the
walls
objected
one
of
the
nomads
olgerd
shook
his
head
dusk
is
deep
here
take
this
ax
djebal
and
cut
down
the
cross
at
the
base
it
falls
forward
it
will
crush
him
objected
djebal
can
cut
it
so
it
will
fall
backward
but
then
the
shock
of
the
fall
may
crack
his
skull
and
tear
loose
all
his
entrails
he
worthy
to
ride
with
me
he
survive
it
answered
olgerd
imperturbably
not
then
he
does
deserve
to
live
cut
the
first
impact
of
the
against
the
wood
and
its
accompanying
vibrations
sent
lances
of
agony
through
conan
swollen
feet
and
hands
again
and
again
the
blade
fell
and
each
stroke
reverberated
on
his
bruised
brain
setting
his
tortured
nerves
aquiver
but
he
set
his
teeth
and
made
no
sound
the
ax
cut
through
the
cross
reeled
on
its
splintered
base
and
toppled
backward
conan
made
his
whole
body
a
solid
knot
of
muscle
jammed
his
head
back
hard
against
the
wood
and
held
it
rigid
there
the
beam
struck
the
ground
heavily
and
rebounded
slightly
the
impact
tore
his
wounds
and
dazed
him
for
an
instant
he
fought
the
rushing
tide
of
blackness
sick
and
dizzy
but
realized
that
the
iron
muscles
that
sheathed
his
vitals
had
saved
him
from
permanent
injury
and
he
had
made
no
sound
though
blood
oozed
from
his
nostrils
and
his
quivered
with
nausea
with
a
grunt
of
approval
djebal
bent
over
him
with
a
pair
of
pincers
used
to
draw
nails
and
gripped
the
head
of
the
spike
in
conan
right
hand
tearing
the
skin
to
get
a
grip
on
the
deeply
embedded
head
the
pincers
were
small
for
that
work
djebal
sweated
and
tugged
swearing
and
wrestling
with
the
stubborn
iron
working
it
back
and
forth
in
swollen
flesh
as
well
as
in
wood
blood
started
oozing
over
the
cimmerian
fingers
he
lay
so
still
he
might
have
been
dead
except
for
the
spasmodic
rise
and
fall
of
his
great
chest
the
spike
gave
way
and
djebal
held
up
the
thing
with
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
then
flung
it
away
and
bent
over
the
other
the
process
was
repeated
and
then
djebal
turned
his
attention
to
conan
skewered
feet
but
the
cimmerian
struggling
up
to
a
sitting
posture
wrenched
the
pincers
from
his
fingers
and
sent
him
staggering
backward
with
a
violent
shove
conan
hands
were
swollen
to
almost
twice
their
normal
size
his
fingers
felt
like
misshapen
thumbs
and
closing
his
hands
was
an
agony
that
brought
blood
streaming
from
under
his
grinding
teeth
but
somehow
clutching
the
pincers
clumsily
with
both
hands
he
managed
to
wrench
out
first
one
spike
and
then
the
other
they
were
not
driven
so
deeply
into
the
wood
as
the
others
had
been
he
rose
stiffly
and
stood
upright
on
his
swollen
lacerated
feet
swaying
drunkenly
the
icy
sweat
dripping
from
his
face
and
body
cramps
assailed
him
and
he
clamped
his
jaws
against
the
desire
to
retch
olgerd
watching
him
impersonally
motioned
him
toward
the
stolen
horse
conan
stumbled
toward
it
and
every
step
was
a
stabbing
throbbing
hell
that
flecked
his
lips
with
bloody
foam
one
misshapen
groping
hand
fell
clumsily
on
the
a
bloody
foot
somehow
found
the
stirrup
setting
his
teeth
he
swung
up
and
he
almost
fainted
in
midair
but
he
came
down
in
the
saddle
and
as
he
did
so
olgerd
struck
the
horse
sharply
with
his
whip
the
startled
beast
reared
and
the
man
in
the
saddle
swayed
and
slumped
like
a
sack
of
sand
almost
unseated
conan
had
wrapped
a
rein
about
each
hand
holding
it
in
place
with
a
clamping
thumb
drunkenly
he
exerted
the
strength
of
his
knotted
biceps
wrenching
the
horse
down
it
screamed
its
jaw
almost
dislocated
one
of
the
shemites
lifted
a
questioningly
olgerd
shook
his
head
him
wait
until
we
get
to
camp
it
only
ten
miles
if
he
fit
to
live
in
the
desert
he
live
that
long
without
a
drink
the
group
rode
like
swift
ghosts
toward
the
river
among
them
conan
swayed
like
a
drunken
man
in
the
saddle
bloodshot
eyes
glazed
foam
drying
on
his
blackened
lips
a
letter
to
nemedia
the
savant
astreas
traveling
in
the
east
in
his
search
for
knowledge
wrote
a
letter
to
his
friend
and
alcemides
in
his
native
nemedia
which
constitutes
the
entire
knowledge
of
the
western
nations
concerning
the
events
of
that
period
in
the
east
always
a
hazy
region
in
the
minds
of
the
western
folk
astreas
wrote
in
part
can
scarcely
conceive
my
dear
old
friend
of
the
conditions
now
existing
in
this
tiny
kingdom
since
queen
taramis
admitted
constantius
and
his
mercenaries
an
event
which
i
briefly
described
in
my
last
hurried
letter
seven
months
have
passed
since
then
during
which
time
it
seems
as
though
the
devil
himself
had
been
loosed
in
this
unfortunate
realm
taramis
seems
to
have
gone
quite
mad
whereas
formerly
she
was
famed
for
her
virtue
justice
and
tranquillity
she
is
now
notorious
for
qualities
precisely
opposite
to
those
just
enumerated
her
private
life
is
a
scandal
or
perhaps
private
is
not
the
correct
term
since
the
queen
makes
no
attempt
to
conceal
the
debauchery
of
her
court
she
constantly
indulges
in
the
most
infamous
revelries
in
which
the
unfortunate
ladies
of
the
court
are
forced
to
join
young
married
women
as
well
as
virgins
herself
has
not
bothered
to
marry
her
paramour
constantius
who
sits
on
the
throne
beside
her
and
reigns
as
her
royal
consort
and
his
officers
follow
his
example
and
do
not
hesitate
to
debauch
any
woman
they
desire
regardless
of
her
rank
or
station
the
wretched
kingdom
groans
under
exorbitant
taxation
the
farms
are
stripped
to
the
bone
and
the
merchants
go
in
rags
which
are
all
that
is
left
them
by
the
nay
they
are
lucky
if
they
escape
with
a
whole
skin
sense
your
incredulity
good
alcemides
you
will
fear
that
i
exaggerate
conditions
in
khauran
such
conditions
would
be
unthinkable
in
any
of
the
western
countries
admittedly
but
you
must
realize
the
vast
difference
that
exists
between
west
and
east
especially
this
part
of
the
east
in
the
first
place
khauran
is
a
kingdom
of
no
great
size
one
of
the
many
principalities
which
at
one
time
formed
the
eastern
part
of
the
empire
of
koth
and
which
later
regained
the
independence
which
was
theirs
at
a
still
earlier
age
this
part
of
the
world
is
made
up
of
these
tiny
realms
diminutive
in
comparison
with
the
great
kingdoms
of
the
west
or
the
great
sultanates
of
the
farther
east
but
important
in
their
control
of
the
caravan
routes
and
in
the
wealth
concentrated
in
them
is
the
most
southeasterly
of
these
principalities
bordering
on
the
very
deserts
of
eastern
shem
the
city
of
khauran
is
the
only
city
of
any
magnitude
in
the
realm
and
stands
within
sight
of
the
river
which
separates
the
grasslands
from
the
sandy
desert
like
a
to
guard
the
fertile
meadows
behind
it
the
land
is
so
rich
that
it
yields
three
and
four
crops
a
year
and
the
plains
north
and
west
of
the
city
are
dotted
with
villages
to
one
accustomed
to
the
great
plantations
and
of
the
west
it
is
strange
to
see
these
tiny
fields
and
vineyards
yet
wealth
in
grain
and
fruit
pours
from
them
as
from
a
horn
of
plenty
the
villagers
are
agriculturists
nothing
else
of
a
mixed
aboriginal
race
they
are
unwarlike
unable
to
protect
themselves
and
forbidden
the
possession
of
arms
dependent
wholly
upon
the
soldiers
of
the
city
for
protection
they
are
helpless
under
the
present
conditions
so
the
savage
revolt
of
the
rural
sections
which
would
be
a
certainty
in
any
western
nation
is
here
impossible
toil
supinely
under
the
iron
hand
of
constantius
and
his
shemites
ride
incessantly
through
the
fields
with
whips
in
their
hands
like
the
of
the
black
serfs
who
toil
in
the
plantations
of
southern
zingara
do
the
people
of
the
city
fare
any
better
their
wealth
is
stripped
from
them
their
fairest
daughters
taken
to
glut
the
insatiable
lust
of
constantius
and
his
mercenaries
these
men
are
utterly
without
mercy
or
compassion
possessed
of
all
the
characteristics
our
armies
learned
to
abhor
in
our
wars
against
the
shemitish
allies
of
argos
inhuman
cruelty
lust
and
ferocity
the
people
of
the
city
are
khauran
ruling
caste
predominantly
hyborian
and
valorous
and
but
the
treachery
of
their
queen
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
their
oppressors
the
shemites
are
the
only
armed
force
in
khauran
and
the
most
hellish
punishment
is
inflicted
on
any
khaurani
found
possessing
weapons
a
systematic
persecution
to
destroy
the
young
khaurani
men
able
to
bear
arms
has
been
savagely
pursued
many
have
ruthlessly
been
slaughtered
others
sold
as
slaves
to
the
turanians
thousands
have
fled
the
kingdom
and
either
entered
the
service
of
other
rulers
or
become
outlaws
lurking
in
numerous
bands
along
the
borders
present
there
is
some
possibility
of
invasion
from
the
desert
which
is
inhabited
by
tribes
of
shemitish
nomads
the
mercenaries
of
constantius
are
men
from
the
shemitish
cities
of
the
west
pelishtim
anakim
akkharim
and
are
ardently
hated
by
the
zuagirs
and
other
wandering
tribes
as
you
know
good
alcemides
the
countries
of
these
barbarians
are
divided
into
the
western
meadowlands
which
stretch
to
the
distant
ocean
and
in
which
rise
the
cities
of
the
and
the
eastern
deserts
where
the
lean
nomads
hold
sway
there
is
incessant
warfare
between
the
dwellers
of
the
cities
and
the
dwellers
of
the
desert
zuagirs
have
fought
with
and
raided
khauran
for
centuries
without
success
but
they
resent
its
conquest
by
their
western
kin
it
is
rumored
that
their
natural
antagonism
is
being
fomented
by
the
man
who
was
formerly
the
captain
of
the
queen
guard
and
who
somehow
escaping
the
hate
of
constantius
who
actually
had
him
upon
the
cross
fled
to
the
nomads
he
is
called
conan
and
is
himself
a
barbarian
one
of
those
gloomy
cimmerians
whose
ferocity
our
soldiers
have
more
than
once
learned
to
their
bitter
cost
it
is
rumored
that
he
has
become
the
man
of
olgerd
vladislav
the
adventurer
who
wandered
down
from
the
northern
steppes
and
made
himself
chief
of
a
band
of
zuagirs
there
are
also
rumors
that
this
band
has
increased
vastly
in
the
last
few
months
and
that
olgerd
incited
no
doubt
by
this
cimmerian
is
even
considering
a
raid
on
khauran
can
not
be
anything
more
than
a
raid
as
the
zuagirs
are
without
or
the
knowledge
of
investing
a
city
and
it
has
been
proven
repeatedly
in
the
past
that
the
nomads
in
their
loose
formation
or
rather
lack
of
formation
are
no
match
in
fighting
for
the
warriors
of
the
shemitish
cities
the
natives
of
khauran
would
perhaps
welcome
this
conquest
since
the
nomads
could
deal
with
them
no
more
harshly
than
their
present
masters
and
even
total
extermination
would
be
preferable
to
the
suffering
they
have
to
endure
but
they
are
so
cowed
and
helpless
that
they
could
give
no
aid
to
the
invaders
plight
is
most
wretched
taramis
apparently
possessed
of
a
demon
stops
at
nothing
she
has
abolished
the
worship
of
ishtar
and
turned
the
temple
into
a
shrine
of
idolatry
she
has
destroyed
the
ivory
image
of
the
goddess
which
these
eastern
hyborians
worship
and
which
inferior
as
it
is
to
the
true
religion
of
mitra
which
we
western
nations
recognize
is
still
superior
to
the
of
the
shemites
and
filled
the
temple
of
ishtar
with
obscene
images
of
every
imaginable
sort
gods
and
goddesses
of
the
night
portrayed
in
all
the
salacious
and
perverse
poses
and
with
all
the
revolting
characteristics
that
a
degenerate
brain
could
conceive
many
of
these
images
are
to
be
identified
as
foul
deities
of
the
shemites
the
turanians
the
vendhyans
and
the
khitans
but
others
are
reminiscent
of
a
hideous
and
antiquity
vile
shapes
forgotten
except
in
the
most
obscure
legends
where
the
queen
gained
the
knowledge
of
them
i
dare
not
even
hazard
a
guess
has
instituted
human
sacrifice
and
since
her
mating
with
constantius
no
less
then
five
hundred
men
women
and
children
have
been
immolated
some
of
these
have
died
on
the
altar
she
has
set
up
in
the
temple
herself
wielding
the
sacrificial
dagger
but
most
have
met
a
more
horrible
doom
has
placed
some
sort
of
monster
in
a
crypt
in
the
temple
what
it
is
and
whence
it
came
none
knows
but
shortly
after
she
had
crushed
the
desperate
revolt
of
her
soldiers
against
constantius
she
spent
a
night
alone
in
the
desecrated
temple
alone
except
for
a
dozen
bound
captives
and
the
shuddering
people
saw
thick
smoke
curling
up
from
the
dome
heard
all
night
the
frenetic
chanting
of
the
queen
and
the
agonized
cries
of
her
tortured
captives
and
toward
dawn
another
voice
mingled
with
these
sounds
a
strident
inhuman
croaking
that
froze
the
blood
of
all
who
heard
the
full
dawn
taramis
reeled
drunkenly
from
the
temple
her
eyes
blazing
with
demoniac
triumph
the
captives
were
never
seen
again
nor
the
croaking
voice
heard
but
there
is
a
room
in
the
temple
into
which
none
ever
goes
but
the
queen
driving
a
human
sacrifice
before
her
and
this
victim
is
never
seen
again
all
know
that
in
that
grim
chamber
lurks
some
monster
from
the
black
night
of
ages
which
devours
the
shrieking
humans
taramis
delivers
up
to
it
can
no
longer
think
of
her
as
a
mortal
woman
but
as
a
rabid
crouching
in
her
lair
amongst
the
bones
and
fragments
of
her
victims
with
taloned
crimsoned
fingers
that
the
gods
allow
her
to
pursue
her
awful
course
unchecked
almost
shakes
my
faith
in
divine
justice
i
compare
her
present
conduct
with
her
deportment
when
first
i
came
to
khauran
seven
months
ago
i
am
confused
with
bewilderment
and
almost
inclined
to
the
belief
held
by
many
of
the
people
that
a
demon
has
possessed
the
body
of
taramis
a
young
soldier
valerius
had
another
belief
he
believed
that
a
witch
had
assumed
a
form
identical
with
that
of
khauran
adored
ruler
he
believed
that
taramis
had
been
spirited
away
in
the
night
and
confined
in
some
dungeon
and
that
this
being
ruling
in
her
place
was
but
a
female
sorcerer
he
swore
that
he
would
find
the
real
queen
if
she
still
lived
but
i
greatly
fear
that
he
himself
has
fallen
victim
to
the
cruelty
of
constantius
he
was
implicated
in
the
revolt
of
the
palace
guards
escaped
and
remained
in
hiding
for
some
time
stubbornly
refusing
to
seek
safety
abroad
and
it
was
during
this
time
that
i
encountered
him
and
he
told
me
his
beliefs
he
has
disappeared
as
so
many
have
whose
fate
one
dares
not
conjecture
and
i
fear
he
has
been
apprehended
by
the
spies
of
constantius
i
must
conclude
this
letter
and
slip
it
out
of
the
city
by
means
of
a
swift
which
will
carry
it
to
the
post
whence
i
purchased
it
on
the
borders
of
koth
by
rider
and
it
will
eventually
come
to
you
i
must
haste
before
dawn
it
is
late
and
the
stars
gleam
whitely
on
the
gardened
roofs
of
khauran
a
shuddering
silence
envelops
the
city
in
which
i
hear
the
throb
of
a
sullen
drum
from
the
distant
temple
i
doubt
not
that
taramis
is
there
concocting
more
devilry
but
the
savant
was
incorrect
in
his
conjecture
concerning
the
whereabouts
of
the
woman
he
called
taramis
the
girl
whom
the
world
knew
as
queen
of
khauran
stood
in
a
dungeon
lighted
only
by
a
flickering
torch
which
played
on
her
features
etching
the
diabolical
cruelty
of
her
beautiful
countenance
on
the
bare
stone
floor
before
her
crouched
a
figure
whose
nakedness
was
scarcely
covered
with
tattered
rags
this
figure
salome
touched
contemptuously
with
the
upturned
toe
of
her
gilded
sandal
and
smiled
vindictively
as
her
victim
shrank
away
do
not
love
my
caresses
sweet
sister
taramis
was
still
beautiful
in
spite
of
her
rags
and
the
imprisonment
and
abuse
of
seven
weary
months
she
did
not
reply
to
her
taunts
but
bent
her
head
as
one
grown
accustomed
to
mockery
this
resignation
did
not
please
salome
she
bit
her
red
lip
and
stood
tapping
the
toe
of
her
shoe
against
the
floor
as
she
frowned
down
at
the
passive
figure
salome
was
clad
in
the
barbaric
splendor
of
a
woman
of
shushan
jewels
glittered
in
the
torchlight
on
her
gilded
sandals
on
her
gold
and
the
slender
chains
that
held
them
in
place
gold
anklets
clashed
as
she
moved
jeweled
bracelets
weighted
her
bare
arms
her
tall
coiffure
was
that
of
a
shemitish
woman
and
jade
pendants
hung
from
gold
hoops
in
her
ears
flashing
and
sparkling
with
each
impatient
movement
of
her
haughty
head
a
girdle
supported
a
silk
shirt
so
transparent
that
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
cynical
mockery
of
convention
suspended
from
her
shoulders
and
trailing
down
her
back
hung
a
darkly
scarlet
cloak
and
this
was
thrown
carelessly
over
the
crook
of
one
arm
and
the
bundle
that
arm
supported
salome
stooped
suddenly
and
with
her
free
hand
grasped
her
dishevelled
hair
and
forced
back
the
girl
head
to
stare
into
her
eyes
taramis
met
that
tigerish
glare
without
flinching
are
not
so
ready
with
your
tears
as
formerly
sweet
sister
muttered
the
shall
wring
no
more
tears
from
me
answered
taramis
often
you
have
reveled
in
the
spectacle
of
the
queen
of
khauran
sobbing
for
mercy
on
her
knees
i
know
that
you
have
spared
me
only
to
torment
me
that
is
why
you
have
limited
your
tortures
to
such
torments
as
neither
slay
nor
permanently
disfigure
but
i
fear
you
no
longer
you
have
strained
out
the
last
vestige
of
hope
fright
and
shame
from
me
slay
me
and
be
done
with
it
for
i
have
shed
my
last
tear
for
your
enjoyment
you
from
hell
flatter
yourself
my
dear
sister
purred
salome
far
it
is
only
your
handsome
body
that
i
have
caused
to
suffer
only
your
pride
and
that
i
have
crushed
you
forget
that
unlike
myself
you
are
capable
of
mental
torment
i
have
observed
this
when
i
have
regaled
you
with
narratives
concerning
the
comedies
i
have
enacted
with
some
of
your
stupid
subjects
but
this
time
i
have
brought
more
vivid
proof
of
these
farces
did
you
know
that
krallides
your
faithful
councillor
had
come
skulking
back
from
turan
and
been
captured
taramis
turned
pale
what
have
you
done
to
him
for
answer
salome
drew
the
mysterious
bundle
from
under
her
cloak
she
shook
off
the
silken
swathings
and
held
it
up
the
head
of
a
young
man
the
features
frozen
in
a
convulsion
as
if
death
had
come
in
the
midst
of
inhuman
agony
taramis
cried
out
as
if
a
blade
had
pierced
her
heart
ishtar
krallides
he
was
seeking
to
stir
up
the
people
against
me
poor
fool
telling
them
that
conan
spoke
the
truth
when
he
said
i
was
not

would
the
people
rise
against
the

sister
she
paused
smiling
down
at
her
victim
you
discovered
that
you
still
have
unshed
tears
good
i
reserved
the
mental
torment
for
the
last
hereafter
i
shall
show
you
many
such
sights
as
this
standing
there
in
the
torchlight
with
the
severed
head
in
her
hand
she
did
not
look
like
anything
ever
borne
by
a
human
woman
in
spite
of
her
awful
beauty
taramis
did
not
look
up
she
lay
face
down
on
the
slimy
floor
her
slim
body
shaken
in
sobs
of
agony
beating
her
clenched
hands
against
the
stones
salome
sauntered
toward
the
door
her
anklets
clashing
at
each
step
her
ear
pendants
winking
in
the
a
few
moments
later
she
emerged
from
a
door
under
a
sullen
arch
that
led
into
a
court
which
in
turn
opened
upon
a
winding
alley
a
man
standing
there
turned
toward
her
a
giant
shemite
with
sombre
eyes
and
shoulders
like
a
bull
his
great
black
beard
falling
over
his
mighty
breast
wept
his
rumble
was
like
that
of
a
bull
deep
and
stormy
he
was
the
general
of
the
mercenaries
one
of
the
few
even
of
constantius
associates
who
knew
the
secret
of
the
queens
of
khauran
khumbanigash
there
are
whole
sections
of
her
sensibilities
that
i
have
not
touched
when
one
sense
is
dulled
by
continual
laceration
i
will
discover
a
newer
more
poignant
pang
here
dog
a
trembling
shambling
figure
in
rags
filth
and
matted
hair
approached
one
of
the
beggars
that
slept
in
the
alleys
and
open
courts
salome
tossed
the
head
to
him
deaf
one
cast
that
in
the
nearest
sewer
make
the
sign
with
your
hands
khumbanigash
he
can
not
hear
the
general
complied
and
the
tousled
head
bobbed
as
the
man
turned
painfully
away
do
you
keep
up
this
farce
rumbled
khumbanigash
are
so
firmly
established
on
the
throne
that
nothing
can
unseat
you
what
if
khaurani
fools
learn
the
truth
they
can
do
nothing
proclaim
yourself
in
your
true
identity
show
them
their
beloved
and
cut
off
her
head
in
the
public
square
yet
good
khumbanigash
the
arched
door
slammed
on
the
hard
accents
of
salome
the
stormy
reverberations
of
khumbanigash
the
mute
beggar
crouched
in
the
courtyard
and
there
was
none
to
see
that
the
hands
which
held
the
severed
head
were
quivering
strongly
brown
sinewy
hands
strangely
incongruous
with
the
bent
body
and
filthy
tatters
knew
it
it
was
a
fierce
vibrant
whisper
scarcely
audible
lives
oh
krallides
your
martyrdom
was
not
in
vain
they
have
her
locked
in
that
dungeon

olgerd

filled
his
jeweled
goblet
with
crimson
wine
from
a
golden
jug
and
thrust
the
vessel
across
the
ebony
table
to
conan
the
cimmerian
olgerd
apparel
would
have
satisfied
the
vanity
of
any
zaporoskan
hetman
his
was
of
white
silk
with
pearls
sewn
on
the
bosom
girdled
at
the
waist
with
a
bakhauriot
belt
its
skirts
were
drawn
back
to
reveal
his
wide
silken
breeches
tucked
into
short
boots
of
soft
green
leather
adorned
with
gold
thread
on
his
head
was
a
green
silk
turban
wound
about
a
spired
helmet
chased
with
gold
his
only
weapon
was
a
broad
curved
cherkees
knife
in
an
ivory
sheath
girdled
high
on
his
left
hip
fashion
throwing
himself
back
in
his
gilded
chair
with
its
carven
eagles
olgerd
spread
his
booted
legs
before
him
and
gulped
down
the
sparkling
wine
noisily
to
his
splendor
the
huge
cimmerian
opposite
him
offered
a
strong
contrast
with
his
black
mane
brown
scarred
countenance
and
burning
blue
eyes
he
was
clad
in
black
and
the
only
glitter
about
him
was
the
broad
gold
buckle
of
the
belt
which
supported
his
sword
in
its
worn
leather
scabbard
they
were
alone
in
the
tent
which
was
hung
with
tapestries
and
littered
with
rich
carpets
and
velvet
cushions
the
loot
of
the
caravans
from
outside
came
a
low
incessant
murmur
the
sound
that
always
accompanies
a
great
throng
of
men
in
camp
or
otherwise
an
occasional
gust
of
desert
wind
rattled
the
in
the
shadow
tomorrow
in
the
sun
quoth
olgerd
loosening
his
crimson
girdle
a
trifle
and
reaching
again
for
the
the
way
of
life
once
i
was
a
hetman
on
the
zaporoska
now
i
a
desert
chief
seven
months
ago
you
were
hanging
on
a
cross
outside
khauran
now
you
lieutenant
to
the
most
powerful
raider
between
turan
and
the
western
meadows
you
should
be
thankful
to
me
recognizing
my
usefulness
conan
laughed
and
lifted
the
jug
you
allow
the
elevation
of
a
man
one
can
be
sure
that
you
profit
by
his
advancement
i
earned
everything
i
won
with
my
blood
and
sweat
he
glanced
at
the
scars
on
the
insides
of
his
palms
there
were
scars
too
on
his
body
scars
that
had
not
been
there
seven
months
ago
fight
like
a
regiment
of
devils
conceded
olgerd
do
get
to
thinking
that
you
had
anything
to
do
with
the
recruits
swarmed
in
to
join
us
it
was
our
success
at
raiding
guided
by
my
wit
that
brought
them
in
these
nomads
are
always
looking
for
a
successful
leader
to
follow
and
they
have
more
faith
in
a
foreigner
than
in
one
of
their
own
race
no
limit
to
what
we
may
accomplish
we
have
eleven
thousand
men
now
in
another
year
we
may
have
three
times
that
number
contented
ourselves
so
far
with
raids
on
the
turanian
outposts
and
the
to
the
west
with
thirty
or
forty
thousand
men
we
raid
no
longer
we
invade
and
conquer
and
establish
ourselves
as
rulers
be
emperor
of
all
shem
yet
and
you
be
my
vizier
so
long
as
you
carry
out
my
orders
unquestioningly
in
the
meantime
i
think
we
ride
eastward
and
storm
that
turanian
outpost
at
vezek
where
the
caravans
pay
toll
conan
shook
his
head
think
not
olgerd
glared
his
quick
temper
irritated
do
you
mean
think
not
i
do
the
thinking
for
this
army
are
enough
men
in
this
band
now
for
my
purpose
answered
the
cimmerian
sick
of
waiting
i
have
a
score
to
settle
olgerd
scowled
and
gulped
wine
then
grinned
thinking
of
that
cross
eh
well
i
like
a
good
hater
but
that
can
wait
told
me
once
you
aid
me
in
taking
khauran
said
conan
but
that
was
before
i
began
to
see
the
full
possibilities
of
our
power
answered
olgerd
was
only
thinking
of
the
loot
in
the
city
i
do
want
to
waste
our
strength
unprofitably
khauran
is
too
strong
a
nut
for
us
to
crack
now
maybe
in
a
year
the
week
answered
conan
and
the
stared
at
the
certainty
in
his
voice
said
olgerd
if
i
were
willing
to
throw
away
men
on
such
a
attempt
what
could
you
expect
do
you
think
these
wolves
could
besiege
and
take
a
city
like
khauran
be
no
siege
answered
the
cimmerian
know
how
to
draw
constantius
out
into
the
plain
what
then
cried
olgerd
with
an
oath
the
our
horsemen
would
have
the
worst
of
it
for
the
armor
of
the
is
the
better
and
when
it
came
to
their
ranks
of
trained
swordsmen
would
cleave
through
our
loose
lines
and
scatter
our
men
like
chaff
before
the
wind
if
there
were
three
thousand
desperate
hyborian
horsemen
fighting
in
a
solid
wedge
such
as
i
could
teach
them
answered
conan
where
would
you
secure
three
thousand
hyborians
asked
olgerd
with
vast
sarcasm
you
conjure
them
out
of
the
air
them
answered
the
cimmerian
imperturbably
thousand
men
of
khauran
camp
at
the
oasis
of
akrel
awaiting
my
orders
olgerd
glared
like
a
startled
wolf
men
who
had
fled
from
the
tyranny
of
constantius
most
of
them
have
been
living
the
lives
of
outlaws
in
the
deserts
east
of
khauran
and
are
gaunt
and
hard
and
desperate
as
tigers
one
of
them
will
be
a
match
for
any
three
squat
mercenaries
it
takes
oppression
and
hardship
to
stiffen
men
guts
and
put
the
fire
of
hell
into
their
thews
they
were
broken
up
into
small
bands
all
they
needed
was
a
leader
they
believed
the
word
i
sent
them
by
my
riders
and
assembled
at
the
oasis
and
put
themselves
at
my
disposal
this
without
my
knowledge
a
feral
light
began
to
gleam
in
olgerd
eye
he
hitched
at
his
was
they
wished
to
follow
not
what
did
you
tell
these
outcasts
to
gain
their
allegiance
there
was
a
dangerous
ring
in
olgerd
voice
told
them
that
i
use
this
horde
of
desert
wolves
to
help
them
destroy
constantius
and
give
khauran
back
into
the
hands
of
its
citizens
fool
whispered
olgerd
you
deem
yourself
chief
already
the
men
were
on
their
feet
facing
each
other
across
the
ebony
board
dancing
in
olgerd
cold
gray
eyes
a
grim
smile
on
the
cimmerian
hard
lips
have
you
torn
between
four
said
the
calmly
the
men
and
bid
them
do
it
challenged
conan
if
they
obey
you
baring
his
teeth
in
a
snarl
olgerd
lifted
his
hand
then
paused
there
was
something
about
the
confidence
in
the
cimmerian
dark
face
that
shook
him
his
eyes
began
to
burn
like
those
of
a
wolf
scum
of
the
western
hills
he
muttered
you
dared
seek
to
undermine
my
power
did
have
to
answered
conan
lied
when
you
said
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
bringing
in
the
new
recruits
i
had
everything
to
do
with
it
they
took
your
orders
but
they
fought
for
me
there
is
not
room
for
two
chiefs
of
the
zuagirs
they
know
i
am
the
stronger
man
i
understand
them
better
than
you
and
they
me
because
i
am
a
barbarian
too
what
will
they
say
when
you
ask
them
to
fight
for
khauran
asked
olgerd
sardonically
follow
me
i
promise
them
a
of
gold
from
the
palace
khauran
will
be
willing
to
pay
that
as
a
guerdon
for
getting
rid
of
constantius
after
that
i
lead
them
against
the
turanians
as
you
have
planned
they
want
loot
and
they
as
soon
fight
constantius
for
it
as
anybody
in
olgerd
eyes
grew
a
recognition
of
defeat
in
his
red
dreams
of
empire
he
had
missed
what
was
going
on
about
him
happenings
and
events
that
had
seemed
meaningless
before
now
flashed
into
his
mind
with
their
true
significance
bringing
a
realization
that
conan
spoke
no
idle
boast
the
giant
figure
before
him
was
the
real
chief
of
the
zuagirs
if
you
die
muttered
olgerd
and
his
hand
flickered
toward
his
hilt
but
quick
as
the
stroke
of
a
great
cat
conan
arm
shot
across
the
table
and
his
fingers
locked
on
olgerd
forearm
there
was
a
snap
of
breaking
bones
and
for
a
tense
instant
the
scene
held
the
men
facing
each
other
as
motionless
as
images
perspiration
starting
out
on
olgerd
forehead
conan
laughed
never
easing
his
grip
on
the
broken
arm
you
fit
to
live
olgerd
his
smile
did
not
alter
as
the
corded
muscles
rippled
in
knotting
ridges
along
his
forearm
and
his
fingers
ground
into
the
quivering
flesh
there
was
the
sound
of
broken
bones
grating
together
and
face
turned
the
color
of
ashes
blood
oozed
from
his
lip
where
his
teeth
sank
but
he
uttered
no
sound
with
a
laugh
conan
released
him
and
drew
back
and
the
swayed
caught
the
table
edge
with
his
good
hand
to
steady
himself
give
you
life
olgerd
as
you
gave
it
to
me
said
conan
tranquilly
it
was
for
your
own
ends
that
you
took
me
down
from
the
cross
it
was
a
bitter
test
you
gave
me
then
you
could
have
endured
it
neither
could
anyone
but
a
western
barbarian
your
horse
and
go
it
tied
behind
the
tent
and
food
and
water
are
in
the
none
will
see
your
going
but
go
quickly
there
no
room
for
a
fallen
chief
on
the
desert
if
the
warriors
see
you
maimed
and
deposed
they
never
let
you
leave
the
camp
alive
olgerd
did
not
reply
slowly
without
a
word
he
turned
and
stalked
across
the
tent
through
the
flapped
opening
unspeaking
he
climbed
into
the
saddle
of
the
great
white
stallion
that
stood
tethered
there
in
the
shade
of
a
spreading
and
unspeaking
with
his
broken
arm
thrust
in
the
bosom
of
his
he
reined
the
steed
about
and
rode
eastward
into
the
open
desert
out
of
the
life
of
the
people
of
the
zuagir
inside
the
tent
conan
emptied
the
and
smacked
his
lips
with
relish
tossing
the
empty
vessel
into
a
corner
he
braced
his
belt
and
strode
out
through
the
front
opening
halting
for
a
moment
to
let
his
gaze
sweep
over
the
lines
of
tents
that
stretched
before
him
and
the
figures
that
moved
among
them
arguing
singing
mending
bridles
or
whetting
tulwars
he
lifted
his
voice
in
a
thunder
that
carried
to
the
farthest
confines
of
the
encampment
you
dogs
sharpen
your
ears
and
listen
gather
around
here
i
have
a
tale
to
tell
you
the
voice
from
the
crystal
in
a
chamber
in
a
tower
near
the
city
wall
a
group
of
men
listened
attentively
to
the
words
of
one
of
their
number
they
were
young
men
but
hard
and
sinewy
with
a
bearing
that
comes
only
to
men
rendered
desperate
by
adversity
they
were
clad
in
mail
shirts
and
worn
leather
swords
hung
at
their
girdles
knew
that
conan
spoke
the
truth
when
he
said
it
was
not
taramis
the
speaker
exclaimed
months
i
have
haunted
the
outskirts
of
the
palace
playing
the
part
of
a
deaf
beggar
at
last
i
learned
what
i
had
believed
that
our
queen
was
a
prisoner
in
the
dungeons
that
adjoin
the
palace
i
watched
my
opportunity
and
captured
a
shemitish
jailer
knocked
him
senseless
as
he
left
the
courtyard
late
one
night
dragged
him
into
a
cellar
near
by
and
questioned
him
before
he
died
he
told
me
what
i
have
just
told
you
and
what
we
have
suspected
all
along
that
the
woman
ruling
khauran
is
a
witch
salome
taramis
he
said
is
imprisoned
in
the
lowest
dungeon
invasion
of
the
zuagirs
gives
us
the
opportunity
we
sought
what
conan
means
to
do
i
can
not
say
perhaps
he
merely
wishes
vengeance
on
constantius
perhaps
he
intends
sacking
the
city
and
destroying
it
he
is
a
barbarian
and
no
one
can
understand
their
minds
this
is
what
we
must
do
rescue
taramis
while
the
battle
rages
constantius
will
march
out
into
the
plain
to
give
battle
even
now
his
men
are
mounting
he
will
do
this
because
there
is
not
sufficient
food
in
the
city
to
stand
a
siege
conan
burst
out
of
the
desert
so
suddenly
that
there
was
no
time
to
bring
in
supplies
and
the
cimmerian
is
equipped
for
a
siege
scouts
have
reported
that
the
zuagirs
have
siege
engines
built
undoubtedly
according
to
the
instructions
of
conan
who
learned
all
the
arts
of
war
among
the
western
nations
does
not
desire
a
long
siege
so
he
will
march
with
his
warriors
into
the
plain
where
he
expects
to
scatter
conan
forces
at
one
stroke
he
will
leave
only
a
few
hundred
men
in
the
city
and
they
will
be
on
the
walls
and
in
the
towers
commanding
the
gates
prison
will
be
left
all
but
unguarded
when
we
have
freed
taramis
our
next
actions
will
depend
upon
circumstances
if
conan
wins
we
must
show
taramis
to
the
people
and
bid
them
rise
they
will
oh
they
will
with
their
bare
hands
they
are
enough
to
overpower
the
shemites
left
in
the
city
and
close
the
gates
against
both
the
mercenaries
and
the
nomads
neither
must
get
within
the
walls
then
we
will
parley
with
conan
he
was
always
loyal
to
taramis
if
he
knows
the
truth
and
she
appeals
to
him
i
believe
he
will
spare
the
city
if
which
is
more
probable
constantius
prevails
and
conan
is
routed
we
must
steal
out
of
the
city
with
the
queen
and
seek
safety
in
flight
all
clear
they
replied
with
one
voice
let
us
loosen
our
blades
in
our
scabbards
commend
our
souls
to
ishtar
and
start
for
the
prison
for
the
mercenaries
are
already
marching
through
the
southern
gate
this
was
true
the
dawnlight
glinted
on
peaked
helmets
pouring
in
a
steady
stream
through
the
broad
arch
on
the
bright
housings
of
the
chargers
this
would
be
a
battle
of
horsemen
such
as
is
possible
only
in
the
lands
of
the
east
the
riders
flowed
through
the
gates
like
a
river
of
steel
sombre
figures
in
black
and
silver
mail
with
their
curled
beards
and
hooked
noses
and
their
inexorable
eyes
in
which
glimmered
the
fatality
of
their
race
the
utter
lack
of
doubt
or
of
mercy
the
streets
and
the
walls
were
lined
with
throngs
of
people
who
watched
silently
these
warriors
of
an
alien
race
riding
forth
to
defend
their
native
city
there
was
no
sound
dully
expressionless
they
watched
those
gaunt
people
in
shabby
garments
their
caps
in
their
hands
in
a
tower
that
overlooked
the
broad
street
that
led
to
the
southern
gate
salome
lolled
on
a
velvet
couch
cynically
watching
constantius
as
he
settled
his
broad
about
his
lean
hips
and
drew
on
his
gauntlets
they
were
alone
in
the
chamber
outside
the
rhythmical
clank
of
harness
and
shuffle
of
horses
hoofs
welled
up
through
the
casements
nightfall
quoth
constantius
giving
a
twirl
to
his
thin
mustache
have
some
captives
to
feed
to
your
does
it
not
grow
weary
of
soft
flesh
perhaps
it
would
relish
the
harder
thews
of
a
desert
man
care
you
do
not
fall
prey
to
a
fiercer
beast
than
thaug
warned
the
girl
not
forget
who
it
is
that
leads
these
desert
animals
am
not
likely
to
forget
he
answered
is
one
reason
why
i
am
advancing
to
meet
him
the
dog
has
fought
in
the
west
and
knows
the
art
of
siege
my
scouts
had
some
trouble
in
approaching
his
columns
for
his
outriders
have
eyes
like
hawks
but
they
did
get
close
enough
to
see
the
engines
he
is
dragging
on
wheels
drawn
by
camels
catapults
rams
ballistas
mangonels
by
ishtar
he
must
have
had
ten
thousand
men
working
day
and
night
for
a
month
where
he
got
the
material
for
their
construction
is
more
than
i
can
understand
perhaps
he
has
a
treaty
with
the
turanians
and
gets
supplies
from
them
they
wo
do
him
any
good
i
fought
these
desert
wolves
before
an
exchange
of
arrows
for
awhile
in
which
the
armor
of
my
warriors
protects
them
then
a
charge
and
my
squadrons
sweep
through
the
loose
swarms
of
the
nomads
wheel
and
sweep
back
through
scattering
them
to
the
four
winds
i
ride
back
through
the
south
gate
before
sunset
with
hundreds
of
naked
captives
staggering
at
my
horse
tail
we
hold
a
fête
tonight
in
the
great
square
my
soldiers
delight
in
flaying
their
enemies
alive
we
will
have
a
wholesale
skinning
and
make
these
townsfolk
watch
as
for
conan
it
will
afford
me
intense
pleasure
if
we
take
him
alive
to
impale
him
on
the
palace
steps
as
many
as
you
like
answered
salome
indifferently
would
like
a
dress
made
of
human
hide
but
at
least
a
hundred
captives
you
must
give
to
me
for
the
altar
and
for
thaug
shall
be
done
answered
constantius
with
his
gauntleted
hand
brushing
back
the
thin
hair
from
his
high
bald
forehead
burned
dark
by
the
sun
victory
and
the
fair
honor
of
taramis
he
said
sardonically
and
taking
his
vizored
helmet
under
his
arm
he
lifted
a
hand
in
salute
and
strode
clanking
from
the
chamber
his
voice
drifted
back
harshly
lifted
in
orders
to
his
officers
salome
leaned
back
on
the
couch
yawned
stretched
herself
like
a
great
supple
cat
and
called
a
priest
with
features
like
yellowed
parchment
stretched
over
a
skull
entered
noiselessly
salome
turned
to
an
ivory
pedestal
on
which
stood
two
crystal
globes
and
taking
from
it
the
smaller
she
handed
the
glistening
sphere
to
the
priest
with
constantius
she
said
me
the
news
of
the
battle
go
the
man
bowed
low
and
hiding
the
globe
under
his
dark
mantle
hurried
from
the
chamber
outside
in
the
city
there
was
no
sound
except
the
clank
of
hoofs
and
after
a
while
the
clang
of
a
closing
gate
salome
mounted
a
wide
marble
stair
that
led
to
the
flat
canopied
roof
she
was
above
all
other
buildings
in
the
city
the
streets
were
deserted
the
great
square
in
front
of
the
palace
was
empty
in
normal
times
folk
shunned
the
grim
temple
which
rose
on
the
opposite
side
of
that
square
but
now
the
town
looked
like
a
dead
city
only
on
the
southern
wall
and
the
roofs
that
overlooked
it
was
there
any
sign
of
life
there
the
people
massed
thickly
they
made
no
demonstration
did
not
know
whether
to
hope
for
the
victory
or
defeat
of
constantius
victory
meant
further
misery
under
his
intolerable
rule
defeat
probably
meant
the
sack
of
the
city
and
red
massacre
no
word
had
come
from
conan
they
did
not
know
what
to
expect
at
his
hands
they
remembered
that
he
was
a
barbarian
the
squadrons
of
the
mercenaries
were
moving
out
into
the
plain
in
the
distance
just
this
side
of
the
river
other
dark
masses
were
moving
barely
recognizable
as
men
on
horses
objects
dotted
the
farther
bank
conan
had
not
brought
his
siege
engines
across
the
river
apparently
fearing
an
attack
in
the
midst
of
the
crossing
but
he
had
crossed
with
his
full
force
of
horsemen
the
sun
rose
and
struck
glints
of
fire
from
the
dark
multitudes
the
squadrons
from
the
city
broke
into
a
gallop
a
deep
roar
reached
the
ears
of
the
people
on
the
wall
the
rolling
masses
merged
intermingled
at
that
distance
it
was
a
tangled
confusion
in
which
no
details
stood
out
charge
and
were
not
to
be
identified
clouds
of
dust
rose
from
the
plains
under
the
stamping
hoofs
veiling
the
action
through
these
swirling
clouds
masses
of
riders
loomed
appearing
and
disappearing
and
spears
flashed
salome
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
descended
the
stair
the
palace
lay
silent
all
the
slaves
were
on
the
wall
gazing
vainly
southward
with
the
citizens
she
entered
the
chamber
where
she
had
talked
with
constantius
and
approached
the
pedestal
noting
that
the
crystal
globe
was
clouded
shot
with
bloody
streaks
of
crimson
she
bent
over
the
ball
swearing
under
her
breath
she
called
mists
swirled
in
the
sphere
resolving
themselves
into
billowing
through
which
black
figures
rushed
unrecognizably
steel
glinted
like
lightning
in
the
murk
then
the
face
of
zang
leaped
into
startling
distinctness
it
was
as
if
the
wide
eyes
gazed
up
at
salome
blood
trickled
from
a
gash
in
the
head
the
skin
was
gray
with
dust
the
lips
parted
writhing
to
other
ears
than
salome
it
would
have
seemed
that
the
face
in
the
crystal
contorted
silently
but
sound
to
her
came
as
plainly
from
those
ashen
lips
as
if
the
priest
had
been
in
the
same
room
with
her
instead
of
miles
away
shouting
into
the
smaller
crystal
only
the
gods
of
darkness
knew
what
unseen
magic
filaments
linked
together
those
shimmering
spheres
shrieked
the
bloody
head
hear
she
cried
how
goes
the
battle
is
upon
us
screamed
the
apparition
is
lost
my
horse
is
down
and
i
can
not
win
clear
men
are
falling
around
me
they
are
dying
like
flies
in
their
silvered
mail
yammering
and
tell
me
what
happened
she
cried
harshly
rode
at
the
and
they
came
on
to
meet
us
yowled
the
priest
flew
in
clouds
between
the
hosts
and
the
nomads
wavered
constantius
ordered
the
charge
in
even
ranks
we
thundered
upon
them
the
masses
of
their
horde
opened
to
right
and
left
and
through
the
cleft
rushed
three
thousand
hyborian
horsemen
whose
presence
we
had
not
even
suspected
men
of
khauran
mad
with
hate
big
men
in
full
armor
on
massive
horses
in
a
solid
wedge
of
steel
they
smote
us
like
a
thunderbolt
they
split
our
ranks
asunder
before
we
knew
what
was
upon
us
and
then
the
swarmed
on
us
from
either
flank
have
ripped
our
ranks
apart
broken
and
scattered
us
it
is
a
trick
of
that
devil
conan
the
siege
engines
are
false
mere
frames
of
palm
trunks
and
painted
silk
that
fooled
our
scouts
who
saw
them
from
afar
a
trick
to
draw
us
out
to
our
doom
our
warriors
flee
khumbanigash
is
down
conan
slew
him
i
do
not
see
constantius
the
khaurani
rage
through
our
milling
masses
like
lions
and
the
feather
us
with
arrows
i
ahh
there
was
a
flicker
as
of
lightning
or
trenchant
steel
a
burst
of
bright
blood
then
abruptly
the
image
vanished
like
a
bursting
bubble
and
salome
was
staring
into
an
empty
crystal
ball
that
mirrored
only
her
own
furious
features
she
stood
perfectly
still
for
a
few
moments
erect
and
staring
into
space
then
she
clapped
her
hands
and
another
priest
entered
as
silent
and
immobile
as
the
first
is
beaten
she
said
swiftly
are
doomed
conan
will
be
crashing
at
our
gates
within
the
hour
if
he
catches
me
i
have
no
illusions
as
to
what
i
can
expect
but
first
i
am
going
to
make
sure
that
my
cursed
sister
never
ascends
the
throne
again
follow
me
come
what
may
we
shall
give
thaug
a
feast
as
she
descended
the
stairs
and
galleries
of
the
palace
she
heard
a
faint
rising
echo
from
the
distant
walls
the
people
there
had
begun
to
realize
that
the
battle
was
going
against
constantius
through
the
dust
clouds
masses
of
horsemen
were
visible
racing
toward
the
city
palace
and
prison
were
connected
by
a
long
closed
gallery
whose
vaulted
roof
rose
on
gloomy
arches
hurrying
along
this
the
false
queen
and
her
slave
passed
through
a
heavy
door
at
the
other
end
that
let
them
into
the
recesses
of
the
prison
they
had
emerged
into
a
wide
arched
corridor
at
a
point
near
where
a
stone
stair
descended
into
the
darkness
salome
recoiled
suddenly
swearing
in
the
gloom
of
the
hall
lay
a
motionless
form
a
shemitish
jailer
his
short
beard
tilted
toward
the
roof
as
his
head
hung
on
a
neck
as
panting
voices
from
below
reached
the
girl
ears
she
shrank
back
into
the
black
shadow
of
an
arch
pushing
the
priest
behind
her
her
hand
groping
in
her
girdle
the
vulture
wings
it
was
the
smoky
light
of
a
torch
which
roused
taramis
queen
of
khauran
from
the
slumber
in
which
she
sought
forgetfulness
lifting
herself
on
her
hand
she
raked
back
her
tangled
hair
and
blinked
up
expecting
to
meet
the
mocking
countenance
of
salome
malign
with
new
torments
instead
a
cry
of
pity
and
horror
reached
her
ears
oh
my
queen
the
sound
was
so
strange
to
her
ears
that
she
thought
she
was
still
dreaming
behind
the
torch
she
could
make
out
figures
now
the
glint
of
steel
then
five
countenances
bent
toward
her
not
swarthy
and
but
lean
aquiline
faces
browned
by
the
sun
she
crouched
in
her
tatters
staring
wildly
one
of
the
figures
sprang
forward
and
fell
on
one
knee
before
her
arms
stretched
appealingly
toward
her
taramis
thank
ishtar
we
have
found
you
do
you
not
remember
me
valerius
once
with
your
own
lips
you
praised
me
after
the
battle
of
korveka
she
stammered
suddenly
tears
welled
into
her
eyes
i
dream
it
is
some
magic
of
salome
to
torment
me
the
cry
rang
with
exultation
is
your
own
true
vassals
come
to
rescue
you
yet
we
must
hasten
constantius
fights
in
the
plain
against
conan
who
has
brought
the
zuagirs
across
the
river
but
three
hundred
shemites
yet
hold
the
city
we
slew
the
jailer
and
took
his
keys
and
have
seen
no
other
guards
but
we
must
be
gone
come
the
queen
legs
gave
way
not
from
weakness
but
from
the
reaction
valerius
lifted
her
like
a
child
and
with
the
hurrying
before
them
they
left
the
dungeon
and
went
up
a
slimy
stone
stair
it
seemed
to
mount
endlessly
but
presently
they
emerged
into
a
corridor
they
were
passing
a
dark
arch
when
the
torch
was
suddenly
struck
out
and
the
bearer
cried
out
in
fierce
brief
agony
a
burst
of
blue
fire
glared
in
the
dark
corridor
in
which
the
furious
face
of
salome
was
limned
momentarily
with
a
figure
crouching
beside
her
then
the
eyes
of
the
watchers
were
blinded
by
that
blaze
valerius
tried
to
stagger
along
the
corridor
with
the
queen
dazedly
he
heard
the
sound
of
murderous
blows
driven
deep
in
flesh
accompanied
by
gasps
of
death
and
a
bestial
grunting
then
the
queen
was
torn
brutally
from
his
arms
and
a
savage
blow
on
his
helmet
dashed
him
to
the
floor
grimly
he
crawled
to
his
feet
shaking
his
head
in
an
effort
to
rid
himself
of
the
blue
flame
which
seemed
still
to
dance
devilishly
before
him
when
his
blinded
sight
cleared
he
found
himself
alone
in
the
corridor
alone
except
for
the
dead
his
four
companions
lay
in
their
blood
heads
and
bosoms
cleft
and
gashed
blinded
and
dazed
in
that
glare
they
had
died
without
an
opportunity
of
defending
themselves
the
queen
was
gone
with
a
bitter
curse
valerius
caught
up
his
sword
tearing
his
cleft
helmet
from
his
head
to
clatter
on
the
flags
blood
ran
down
his
cheek
from
a
cut
in
his
scalp
reeling
frantic
with
indecision
he
heard
a
voice
calling
his
name
in
desperate
urgency
he
staggered
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
and
rounded
a
corner
just
in
time
to
have
his
arms
filled
with
a
soft
supple
figure
which
flung
itself
frantically
at
him
are
you
mad
had
to
come
she
sobbed
followed
you
hid
in
an
arch
of
the
outer
court
a
moment
ago
i
saw
emerge
with
a
brute
who
carried
a
woman
in
his
arms
i
knew
it
was
taramis
and
that
you
had
failed
oh
you
are
hurt
scratch
he
put
aside
her
clinging
hands
ivga
tell
me
which
way
they
went
fled
across
the
square
toward
the
temple
he
paled
oh
the
fiend
she
means
to
give
taramis
to
the
devil
she
worships
quick
ivga
run
to
the
south
wall
where
the
people
watch
the
battle
tell
them
that
their
real
queen
has
been
found
that
the
impostor
has
dragged
her
to
the
temple
go
sobbing
the
girl
sped
away
her
light
sandals
pattering
on
the
cobblestones
and
valerius
raced
across
the
court
plunged
into
the
street
dashed
into
the
square
upon
which
it
debouched
and
raced
for
the
great
structure
that
rose
on
the
opposite
side
his
flying
feet
spurned
the
marble
as
he
darted
up
the
broad
stair
and
through
the
pillared
portico
evidently
their
prisoner
had
given
them
some
trouble
taramis
sensing
the
doom
intended
for
her
was
fighting
against
it
with
all
the
strength
of
her
splendid
young
body
once
she
had
broken
away
from
the
brutish
priest
only
to
be
dragged
down
again
the
group
was
halfway
down
the
broad
nave
at
the
other
end
of
which
stood
the
grim
altar
and
beyond
that
the
great
metal
door
obscenely
carven
through
which
many
had
gone
but
from
which
only
salome
had
ever
emerged
taramis
breath
came
in
panting
gasps
her
tattered
garment
had
been
torn
from
her
in
the
struggle
she
writhed
in
the
grasp
of
her
apish
captor
like
a
white
naked
nymph
in
the
arms
of
a
satyr
salome
watched
cynically
though
impatiently
moving
toward
the
carven
door
and
from
the
dusk
that
lurked
along
the
lofty
walls
the
obscene
gods
and
gargoyles
leered
down
as
if
imbued
with
salacious
life
choking
with
fury
valerius
rushed
down
the
great
hall
sword
in
hand
at
a
sharp
cry
from
salome
the
priest
looked
up
then
released
taramis
drew
a
heavy
knife
already
smeared
with
blood
and
ran
at
the
oncoming
khaurani
but
cutting
down
men
blinded
by
the
loosed
by
salome
was
different
from
fighting
a
wiry
young
hyborian
afire
with
hate
and
rage
up
went
the
dripping
knife
but
before
it
could
fall
valerius
keen
narrow
blade
slashed
through
the
air
and
the
fist
that
held
the
knife
jumped
from
its
wrist
in
a
shower
of
blood
valerius
berserk
slashed
again
and
yet
again
before
the
crumpling
figure
could
fall
the
blade
licked
through
flesh
and
bone
the
head
fell
one
way
the
torso
the
other
valerius
whirled
on
his
toes
quick
and
fierce
as
a
glaring
about
for
salome
she
must
have
exhausted
her
in
the
prison
she
was
bending
over
taramis
grasping
her
sister
black
locks
in
one
hand
in
the
other
lifting
a
dagger
then
with
a
fierce
cry
sword
was
sheathed
in
her
breast
with
such
fury
that
the
point
sprang
out
between
her
shoulders
with
an
awful
shriek
the
witch
sank
down
writhing
in
convulsions
grasping
at
the
naked
blade
as
it
was
withdrawn
smoking
and
dripping
her
eyes
were
inhuman
with
a
more
than
human
vitality
she
clung
to
the
life
that
ebbed
through
the
wound
that
split
the
crimson
crescent
on
her
ivory
bosom
she
groveled
on
the
floor
clawing
and
biting
at
the
naked
stones
in
her
agony
sickened
at
the
sight
valerius
stooped
and
lifted
the
queen
turning
his
back
on
the
twisting
figure
on
the
floor
he
ran
toward
the
door
stumbling
in
his
haste
he
staggered
out
upon
the
portico
halted
at
the
head
of
the
steps
the
square
thronged
with
people
some
had
come
at
ivga
incoherent
cries
others
had
deserted
the
walls
in
fear
of
the
onsweeping
hordes
out
of
the
desert
fleeing
unreasoningly
toward
the
centre
of
the
city
dumb
resignation
had
vanished
the
throng
seethed
and
milled
yelling
and
screaming
about
the
road
there
sounded
somewhere
the
splintering
of
stone
and
timbers
a
band
of
grim
shemites
cleft
the
crowd
the
guards
of
the
northern
gates
hurrying
toward
the
south
gate
to
reinforce
their
comrades
there
they
reined
up
short
at
the
sight
of
the
youth
on
the
steps
holding
the
limp
naked
figure
in
his
arms
the
heads
of
the
throng
turned
toward
the
temple
the
crowd
gaped
a
new
bewilderment
added
to
their
swirling
confusion
is
your
queen
yelled
valerius
straining
to
make
himself
understood
above
the
clamor
the
people
gave
back
a
bewildered
roar
they
did
not
understand
and
valerius
sought
in
vain
to
lift
his
voice
above
their
bedlam
the
shemites
rode
toward
the
temple
steps
beating
a
way
through
the
crowd
with
their
spears
then
a
new
grisly
element
introduced
itself
into
the
frenzy
out
of
the
gloom
of
the
temple
behind
valerius
wavered
a
slim
white
figure
laced
with
crimson
the
people
screamed
there
in
the
arms
of
valerius
hung
the
woman
they
thought
their
queen
yet
there
in
the
temple
door
staggered
another
figure
like
a
reflection
of
the
other
their
brains
reeled
valerius
felt
his
blood
congeal
as
he
stared
at
the
swaying
his
sword
had
transfixed
her
sundered
her
heart
she
should
be
dead
by
all
laws
of
nature
she
should
be
dead
yet
there
she
swayed
on
her
feet
clinging
horribly
to
life
she
screamed
reeling
in
the
doorway
as
in
answer
to
that
frightful
invocation
there
boomed
a
thunderous
croaking
from
within
the
temple
the
snapping
of
wood
and
metal
is
the
queen
roared
the
captain
of
the
shemites
lifting
his
bow
down
the
man
and
other
woman
but
the
roar
of
a
roused
rose
from
the
people
they
had
guessed
the
truth
at
last
understood
valerius
frenzied
appeals
knew
that
the
girl
who
hung
limply
in
his
arms
was
their
true
queen
with
a
yell
they
surged
on
the
shemites
tearing
and
smiting
with
tooth
and
nail
and
naked
hands
with
the
desperation
of
fury
loosed
at
last
above
them
salome
swayed
and
tumbled
down
the
marble
stairs
dead
at
last
arrows
flickered
about
him
as
valerius
ran
back
between
the
pillars
of
the
portico
shielding
the
body
of
the
queen
with
his
own
shooting
and
slashing
ruthlessly
the
mounted
shemites
were
holding
their
own
with
the
maddened
crowd
valerius
darted
to
the
temple
door
with
one
foot
on
the
threshold
he
recoiled
crying
out
in
horror
and
despair
out
of
the
gloom
at
the
other
end
of
the
great
hall
a
vast
dark
form
heaved
up
came
rushing
toward
him
in
gigantic
hops
he
saw
the
gleam
of
great
unearthly
eyes
the
shimmer
of
fangs
or
talons
he
fell
back
from
the
door
and
then
the
whir
of
a
shaft
past
his
ear
warned
him
that
death
was
also
behind
him
he
wheeled
desperately
four
or
five
shemites
had
cut
their
way
through
the
throng
and
were
spurring
their
horses
up
the
steps
their
bows
lifted
to
shoot
him
down
he
sprang
behind
a
pillar
on
which
the
arrows
splintered
taramis
had
fainted
she
hung
like
a
dead
woman
in
his
arms
before
the
shemites
could
loose
again
the
doorway
was
blocked
by
a
gigantic
shape
with
affrighted
yells
the
mercenaries
wheeled
and
began
beating
a
frantic
way
through
the
throng
which
crushed
back
in
sudden
galvanized
horror
trampling
one
another
in
their
stampede
but
the
monster
seemed
to
be
watching
valerius
and
the
girl
squeezing
its
vast
unstable
bulk
through
the
door
it
bounded
toward
him
as
he
ran
down
the
steps
he
felt
it
looming
behind
him
a
giant
shadowy
thing
like
a
travesty
of
nature
cut
out
of
the
heart
of
night
a
black
shapelessness
in
which
only
the
staring
eyes
and
gleaming
fangs
were
distinct
there
came
a
sudden
thunder
of
hoofs
a
rout
of
shemites
bloody
and
battered
streamed
across
the
square
from
the
south
plowing
blindly
through
the
packed
throng
behind
them
swept
a
horde
of
horsemen
yelling
in
a
familiar
tongue
waving
red
swords
the
exiles
returned
with
them
rode
fifty
and
at
their
head
a
giant
figure
in
black
mail
shrieked
valerius
the
giant
yelled
a
command
without
checking
their
headlong
pace
the
desert
men
lifted
their
bows
drew
and
loosed
a
cloud
of
arrows
sang
across
the
square
over
the
seething
heads
of
the
multitudes
and
sank
in
the
black
monster
it
halted
wavered
reared
a
black
blot
against
the
marble
pillars
again
the
sharp
cloud
sang
and
yet
again
and
the
horror
collapsed
and
rolled
down
the
steps
as
dead
as
the
witch
who
had
summoned
it
out
of
the
night
of
ages
conan
drew
rein
beside
the
portico
leaped
off
valerius
had
laid
the
queen
on
the
marble
sinking
beside
her
in
utter
exhaustion
the
people
surged
about
crowding
in
the
cimmerian
cursed
them
back
lifted
her
dark
head
pillowed
it
against
his
mailed
shoulder
crom
what
is
this
the
real
taramis
but
who
is
that
yonder
demon
who
wore
her
shape
panted
valerius
conan
swore
heartily
ripping
a
cloak
from
the
shoulders
of
a
soldier
he
wrapped
it
about
the
naked
queen
her
long
dark
lashes
quivered
on
her
cheeks
her
eyes
opened
stared
up
unbelievingly
into
the
cimmerian
scarred
face
her
soft
fingers
caught
at
him
i
dream
told
me
you
were
dead
he
grinned
hardly
do
not
dream
you
are
queen
of
khauran
again
i
broke
constantius
out
there
by
the
river
most
of
his
dogs
never
lived
to
reach
the
walls
for
i
gave
orders
that
no
prisoners
be
taken
except
constantius
the
city
guard
closed
the
gate
in
our
faces
but
we
burst
in
with
rams
swung
from
our
saddles
i
left
all
my
wolves
outside
except
this
fifty
i
did
trust
them
in
here
and
these
khaurani
lads
were
enough
for
the
gate
guards
has
been
a
nightmare
she
whimpered
my
poor
people
you
must
help
me
try
to
repay
them
for
all
they
have
suffered
conan
henceforth
councilor
as
well
as
captain
conan
laughed
but
shook
his
head
rising
he
set
the
queen
upon
her
feet
and
beckoned
to
a
number
of
his
khaurani
horsemen
who
had
not
continued
the
pursuit
of
the
fleeing
shemites
they
sprang
from
their
horses
eager
to
do
the
bidding
of
their
queen
lass
that
over
with
i
chief
of
the
zuagirs
now
and
must
lead
them
to
plunder
the
turanians
as
i
promised
this
lad
valerius
will
make
you
a
better
captain
than
i
was
made
to
dwell
among
marble
walls
anyway
but
i
must
leave
you
now
and
complete
what
i
begun
shemites
still
live
in
khauran
as
valerius
started
to
follow
taramis
across
the
square
towards
the
palace
through
a
lane
opened
by
the
wildly
cheering
multitude
he
felt
a
soft
hand
slipped
timidly
into
his
sinewy
fingers
and
turned
to
receive
the
slender
body
of
ivga
in
his
arms
he
crushed
her
to
him
and
drank
her
kisses
with
the
gratitude
of
a
weary
fighter
who
has
attained
rest
at
last
through
tribulation
and
storm
but
not
all
men
seek
rest
and
peace
some
are
born
with
the
spirit
of
the
storm
in
their
blood
restless
harbingers
of
violence
and
bloodshed
knowing
no
other
path
the
sun
was
rising
the
ancient
caravan
road
was
thronged
with
horsemen
in
a
wavering
line
that
stretched
from
the
walls
of
khauran
to
a
spot
far
out
in
the
plain
conan
the
cimmerian
sat
at
the
head
of
that
column
near
the
jagged
end
of
a
wooden
beam
that
stuck
up
out
of
the
ground
near
that
stump
rose
a
heavy
cross
and
on
that
cross
a
man
hung
by
spikes
through
his
hands
and
feet
months
ago
constantius
said
conan
was
i
who
hung
there
and
you
who
sat
here
constantius
did
not
reply
he
licked
his
gray
lips
and
his
eyes
were
glassy
with
pain
and
fear
muscles
writhed
like
cords
along
his
lean
body
are
more
fit
to
inflict
torture
than
to
endure
it
said
conan
tranquilly
hung
there
on
a
cross
as
you
are
hanging
and
i
lived
thanks
to
circumstances
and
a
stamina
peculiar
to
barbarians
but
you
civilized
men
are
soft
your
lives
are
not
nailed
to
your
spines
as
are
ours
your
fortitude
consists
mainly
in
inflicting
torment
not
in
enduring
it
you
will
be
dead
before
sundown
and
so
falcon
of
the
desert
i
leave
you
to
the
companionship
of
another
bird
of
the
desert
he
gestured
toward
the
vultures
whose
shadows
swept
across
the
sands
as
they
wheeled
overhead
from
the
lips
of
constantius
came
an
inhuman
cry
of
despair
and
horror
conan
lifted
his
reins
and
rode
toward
the
river
that
shone
like
silver
in
the
morning
sun
behind
him
the
riders
struck
into
a
trot
the
gaze
of
each
as
he
passed
a
certain
spot
turned
impersonally
and
with
the
desert
man
lack
of
compassion
toward
the
cross
and
the
gaunt
figure
that
hung
there
black
against
the
sunrise
their
horses
hoofs
beat
out
a
knell
in
the
dust
lower
and
lower
swept
the
wings
of
the
hungry
vultures
