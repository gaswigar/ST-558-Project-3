the
oceans
are
big
and
broad
i
believe
of
the
earth
surface
is
covered
with
water
what
people
inhabit
this
water
has
always
been
a
subject
of
curiosity
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
strange
creatures
come
from
the
seas
at
times
and
perhaps
in
the
ocean
depths
are
many
more
strange
than
mortal
eye
has
ever
gazed
upon
this
story
is
fanciful
in
it
the
sea
people
talk
and
act
much
as
we
do
and
the
mermaids
especially
are
not
unlike
the
fairies
with
whom
we
have
learned
to
be
familiar
yet
they
are
real
sea
people
for
all
that
and
with
the
exception
of
zog
the
magician
they
are
all
supposed
to
exist
in
the
ocean
depths
i
am
told
that
some
very
learned
people
deny
that
mermaids
or
have
ever
inhabited
the
oceans
but
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
them
to
prove
such
an
assertion
unless
they
had
lived
under
the
water
as
trot
and
bill
did
in
this
story
i
hope
my
readers
who
have
so
long
followed
adventures
in
the
land
of
oz
will
be
interested
in
trot
equally
strange
experiences
the
ocean
has
always
appealed
to
me
as
a
veritable
wonderland
and
this
story
has
been
suggested
to
me
many
times
by
my
young
correspondents
in
their
letters
indeed
a
good
many
children
have
implored
me
to
write
something
about
the
mermaids

nobody
said

ever

a

an
lived
to
tell
the
tale
why
not
asked
trot
looking
earnestly
up
into
the
old
face
they
were
seated
on
a
bench
built
around
a
giant
acacia
tree
that
grew
just
at
the
edge
of
the
bluff
below
them
rolled
the
blue
waves
of
the
great
pacific
a
little
way
behind
them
was
the
house
a
neat
frame
cottage
painted
white
and
surrounded
by
huge
eucalyptus
and
pepper
trees
still
farther
behind
that
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
but
built
upon
a
bend
of
the
coast
was
the
village
overlooking
a
pretty
bay
bill
and
trot
came
often
to
this
tree
to
sit
and
watch
the
ocean
below
them
the
sailor
man
had
one
meat
leg
and
one
hickory
leg
and
he
often
said
the
wooden
one
was
the
best
of
the
two
once
bill
had
commanded
and
owned
the
anemone
a
trading
schooner
that
plied
along
the
coast
and
in
those
days
charlie
griffiths
who
was
trot
father
had
been
the
captain
mate
but
ever
since
bill
accident
when
he
lost
his
leg
charlie
griffiths
had
been
the
captain
of
the
little
schooner
while
his
old
master
lived
peacefully
ashore
with
the
griffiths
family
this
was
about
the
time
trot
was
born
and
the
old
sailor
became
very
fond
of
the
baby
girl
her
real
name
was
mayre
but
when
she
grew
big
enough
to
walk
she
took
so
many
busy
little
steps
every
day
that
both
her
mother
and
bill
nicknamed
her
trot
and
so
she
was
thereafter
mostly
called
it
was
the
old
sailor
who
taught
the
child
to
love
the
sea
to
love
it
almost
as
much
as
he
and
her
father
did
and
these
two
who
represented
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
life
became
firm
friends
and
constant
companions
why
has
anybody
seen
a
mermaid
and
lived
asked
trot
again
mermaids
is
fairies
an
ai
meant
to
be
seen
by
us
mortal
folk
replied
bill
but
if
anyone
happens
to
see
what
then
then
he
answered
slowly
wagging
his
head
the
mermaids
give
a
smile
an
a
wink
an
they
dive
into
the
water
an
gets
drownded
they
knew
how
to
swim
bill
that
do
make
any
trot
the
mermaids
live
deep
down
an
the
poor
mortals
never
come
up
again
the
little
girl
was
thoughtful
for
a
moment
but
why
do
folks
dive
in
the
water
when
the
mermaids
smile
an
wink
she
asked
mermaids
he
said
gravely
is
the
most
beautiful
creatures
in
the
world
or
the
water
either
you
know
what
they
like
trot
they
got
a
lovely
lady
form
down
to
the
waist
an
then
the
other
half
of
a
fish
with
green
an
purple
an
pink
scales
all
down
it
have
they
got
arms
bill
trot
arms
like
any
other
lady
an
pretty
faces
that
smile
an
look
mighty
sweet
an
fetchin
their
hair
is
long
soft
an
silky
an
floats
all
around
in
the
water
when
they
comes
up
atop
the
waves
they
wring
the
water
their
hair
and
sing
songs
that
go
right
to
your
heart
if
anybody
is
unlucky
enough
to
be
jes
then
the
beauty
o
them
mermaids
an
their
sweet
songs
charm
like
magic
so
they
plunge
into
the
waves
to
get
to
the
mermaids
but
the
mermaids
have
any
hearts
trot
no
a
fish
has
so
they
laughs
when
the
poor
people
drown
do
care
a
fig
that
why
i
says
an
i
says
it
true
that
nobody
never
sawr
a
mermaid
an
lived
to
tell
the
tale
nobody
asked
trot
nobody
a
tall
then
how
do
you
know
bill
asked
the
little
girl
looking
up
into
his
face
with
big
round
eyes
bill
coughed
then
he
tried
to
sneeze
to
gain
time
then
he
took
out
his
red
cotton
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
bald
head
with
it
rubbing
hard
so
as
to
make
him
think
clearer
look
trot
that
a
brig
out
there
he
inquired
pointing
to
a
sail
far
out
in
the
sea
how
does
anybody
know
about
mermaids
if
those
who
have
seen
them
never
lived
to
tell
about
them
she
asked
again
know
what
about
trot
about
their
green
and
pink
scales
and
pretty
songs
and
wet
hair
they
do
know
i
guess
but
mermaids
jes
natcherly
has
to
be
like
that
or
they
would
be
mermaids
she
thought
this
over
somebody
must
have
lived
bill
she
declared
positively
other
fairies
have
been
seen
by
mortals
why
not
mermaids
they
have
trot
they
have
he
answered
musingly
i
tellin
you
as
it
was
told
to
me
but
i
never
stopped
to
inquire
into
the
matter
so
close
before
seems
like
folks
know
so
much
about
mermaids
if
they
had
seen
an
yet
accordin
to
all
accounts
the
victim
is
bound
to
get
drownded
suggested
trot
softly
someone
found
a
fotygraph
of
one
of
that
might
o
been
trot
that
might
o
been
answered
bill
a
nice
man
was
bill
and
trot
knew
he
always
liked
to
explain
everything
so
she
could
fully
understand
it
the
aged
sailor
was
not
a
very
tall
man
and
some
people
might
have
called
him
chubby
or
even
fat
he
wore
a
blue
sailor
shirt
with
white
anchors
worked
on
the
corners
of
the
broad
square
collar
and
his
blue
trousers
were
very
wide
at
the
bottom
he
always
wore
one
trouser
leg
over
his
wooden
limb
and
sometimes
it
would
flutter
in
the
wind
like
a
flag
because
it
was
so
wide
and
the
wooden
leg
so
slender
his
rough
kersey
coat
was
a
and
came
down
to
his
waistline
in
the
big
pockets
of
his
jacket
he
kept
a
wonderful
jackknife
and
his
pipe
and
tobacco
and
many
bits
of
string
and
matches
and
keys
and
lots
of
other
things
whenever
bill
thrust
a
chubby
hand
into
one
of
his
pockets
trot
watched
him
with
breathless
interest
for
she
never
knew
what
he
was
going
to
pull
out
the
old
sailor
face
was
brown
as
a
berry
he
had
a
fringe
of
hair
around
the
back
of
his
head
and
a
fringe
of
whisker
around
the
edge
of
his
face
running
from
ear
to
ear
and
underneath
his
chin
his
eyes
were
light
blue
and
kind
in
expression
his
nose
was
big
and
broad
and
his
few
teeth
were
not
strong
enough
to
crack
nuts
with
trot
liked
bill
and
had
a
great
deal
of
confidence
in
his
wisdom
and
a
great
admiration
for
his
ability
to
make
tops
and
whistles
and
toys
with
that
marvelous
jackknife
of
his
in
the
village
were
many
boys
and
girls
of
her
own
age
but
she
never
had
as
much
fun
playing
with
them
as
she
had
wandering
by
the
sea
accompanied
by
the
old
sailor
and
listening
to
his
fascinating
stories
she
knew
all
about
the
flying
dutchman
and
davy
jones
locker
and
captain
kidd
and
how
to
harpoon
a
whale
or
dodge
an
iceberg
or
lasso
a
seal
bill
had
been
everywhere
in
the
world
almost
on
his
many
voyages
he
had
been
wrecked
on
desert
islands
like
robinson
crusoe
and
been
attacked
by
cannibals
and
had
a
host
of
other
exciting
adventures
so
he
was
a
delightful
comrade
for
the
little
girl
and
whatever
bill
knew
trot
was
sure
to
know
in
time
how
do
the
mermaids
live
she
asked
are
they
in
caves
or
just
in
the
water
like
fishes
or
how
ca
say
trot
he
replied
i
asked
divers
about
that
but
none
of
ever
run
acrost
a
mermaid
nest
yet
as
i
heard
of
if
they
fairies
she
said
their
homes
must
be
very
pretty
mebbe
so
trot
but
damp
they
are
sure
to
be
damp
you
know
i
like
to
see
a
mermaid
bill
said
the
child
earnestly
what
an
git
drownded
he
exclaimed
no
and
live
to
tell
the
tale
if
they
beautiful
and
laughing
and
sweet
there
ca
be
much
harm
in
them
i
sure
mermaids
is
mermaids
remarked
bill
in
his
most
solemn
voice
it
would
do
us
any
good
to
mix
up
with
trot
called
a
voice
from
the
house
yes
mamma
you
an
bill
come
in
to
supper
chapter
the
mermaids
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
trot
had
helped
wipe
the
breakfast
dishes
and
put
them
away
in
the
cupboard
the
little
girl
and
bill
started
out
toward
the
bluff
the
air
was
soft
and
warm
and
the
sun
turned
the
edges
of
the
waves
into
sparkling
diamonds
across
the
bay
the
last
of
the
fisherboats
was
speeding
away
out
to
sea
for
well
the
fishermen
knew
this
was
an
ideal
day
to
catch
rockbass
barracuda
and
yellowtail
the
old
man
and
the
young
girl
stood
on
the
bluff
and
watched
all
this
with
interest
here
was
their
world
it
is
a
bit
rough
this
morning
let
have
a
boat
ride
bill
said
the
child
suits
me
to
a
t
declared
the
sailor
so
they
found
the
winding
path
that
led
down
the
face
of
the
cliff
to
the
narrow
beach
below
and
cautiously
began
the
descent
trot
never
minded
the
steep
path
or
the
loose
rocks
at
all
but
bill
wooden
leg
was
not
so
useful
on
a
downgrade
as
on
a
level
and
he
had
to
be
careful
not
to
slip
and
take
a
tumble
but
by
and
by
they
reached
the
sands
and
walked
to
a
spot
just
beneath
the
big
acacia
tree
that
grew
on
the
bluff
halfway
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
hung
suspended
a
little
structure
that
sheltered
trot
rowboat
for
it
was
necessary
to
pull
the
boat
out
of
reach
of
the
waves
which
beat
in
fury
against
the
rocks
at
high
tide
about
as
high
up
as
bill
could
reach
was
an
iron
ring
securely
fastened
to
the
cliff
and
to
this
ring
was
tied
a
rope
the
old
sailor
unfastened
the
knot
and
began
paying
out
the
rope
and
the
rowboat
came
out
of
its
shed
and
glided
slowly
downward
to
the
beach
it
hung
on
a
pair
of
davits
and
was
lowered
just
as
a
boat
is
lowered
from
a
ship
side
when
it
reached
the
sands
the
sailor
unhooked
the
ropes
and
pushed
the
boat
to
the
water
edge
it
was
a
pretty
little
craft
light
and
strong
and
bill
knew
how
to
sail
it
or
row
it
as
trot
might
desire
today
they
decided
to
row
so
the
girl
climbed
into
the
bow
and
her
companion
stuck
his
wooden
leg
into
the
water
edge
so
he
get
his
foot
wet
and
pushed
off
the
little
boat
as
he
climbed
aboard
then
he
seized
the
oars
and
began
gently
paddling
whither
away
commodore
trot
he
asked
gaily
i
do
care
it
just
fun
enough
to
be
on
the
water
she
answered
trailing
one
hand
overboard
so
he
rowed
around
by
the
north
promontory
where
the
great
caves
were
and
much
as
they
were
enjoying
the
ride
they
soon
began
to
feel
the
heat
of
the
sun
that
dead
man
cave
a
skellington
was
found
there
observed
the
child
as
they
passed
a
dark
yawning
mouth
in
the
cliff
and
that
bumble
cave
the
bumblebees
make
nests
in
the
top
of
it
and
here
smuggler
cave
the
smugglers
used
to
hide
things
in
it
she
knew
all
the
caves
well
and
so
did
bill
many
of
them
opened
just
at
the
water
edge
and
it
was
possible
to
row
their
boat
far
into
their
dusky
depths
and
here
echo
cave
she
continued
dreamily
as
they
slowly
moved
along
the
coast
and
giant
cave
and
oh
bill
do
you
there
were
ever
any
giants
in
that
cave
like
there
must
o
been
trot
or
they
would
o
named
it
that
name
he
replied
pausing
to
wipe
his
bald
head
with
the
red
handkerchief
while
the
oars
dragged
in
the
water
we
never
been
into
that
cave
she
remarked
looking
at
the
small
hole
in
the
cliff
an
archway
through
which
the
water
flowed
let
go
in
now
what
for
trot
to
see
if
there
a
giant
there
hm
are
you
no
are
you
i
just
do
it
big
enough
for
a
giant
to
get
into
your
father
was
in
there
once
remarked
bill
an
he
says
it
the
biggest
cave
on
the
coast
but
low
down
it
full
water
an
the
water
deep
down
to
the
very
bottom
o
the
ocean
but
the
rock
roof
liable
to
bump
your
head
at
high
tide
it
low
tide
now
returned
trot
and
how
could
any
giant
live
in
there
if
the
roof
is
so
low
down
why
he
could
mate
i
reckon
they
must
have
called
it
cave
it
so
big
an
not
any
giant
man
lived
there
let
go
in
said
the
girl
again
i
like
to
it
all
right
replied
the
sailor
it
be
cooler
in
there
than
out
here
in
the
sun
we
wo
go
very
far
for
when
the
tide
turns
we
might
get
out
again
he
picked
up
the
oars
and
rowed
slowly
toward
the
cave
the
black
archway
that
marked
its
entrance
seemed
hardly
big
enough
to
admit
the
boat
at
first
but
as
they
drew
nearer
the
opening
became
bigger
the
sea
was
very
calm
here
for
the
headland
shielded
it
from
the
breeze
look
out
fer
your
head
trot
cautioned
bill
as
the
boat
glided
slowly
into
the
rocky
arch
but
it
was
the
sailor
who
had
to
duck
instead
of
the
little
girl
only
for
a
moment
though
just
beyond
the
opening
the
cave
was
higher
and
as
the
boat
floated
into
the
dim
interior
they
found
themselves
on
quite
an
extensive
branch
of
the
sea
for
a
time
neither
of
them
spoke
and
only
the
soft
lapping
of
the
water
against
the
sides
of
the
boat
was
heard
a
beautiful
sight
met
the
eyes
of
the
two
adventurers
and
held
them
dumb
with
wonder
and
delight
it
was
not
dark
in
this
vast
cave
yet
the
light
seemed
to
come
from
underneath
the
water
which
all
around
them
glowed
with
an
exquisite
sapphire
color
where
the
little
waves
crept
up
the
sides
of
the
rocks
they
shone
like
brilliant
jewels
and
every
drop
of
spray
seemed
a
gem
fit
to
deck
a
queen
trot
leaned
her
chin
on
her
hands
and
her
elbows
on
her
lap
and
gazed
at
this
charming
sight
with
real
enjoyment
bill
drew
in
the
oars
and
let
the
boat
drift
where
it
would
while
he
also
sat
silently
admiring
the
scene
slowly
the
little
craft
crept
farther
and
farther
into
the
dim
interior
of
the
vast
cavern
while
its
two
passengers
feasted
their
eyes
on
the
beauties
constantly
revealed
both
the
old
seaman
and
the
little
girl
loved
the
ocean
in
all
its
various
moods
to
them
it
was
a
constant
companion
and
a
genial
comrade
if
it
stormed
and
raved
they
laughed
with
glee
if
it
rolled
great
breakers
against
the
shore
they
clapped
their
hands
joyfully
if
it
lay
slumbering
at
their
feet
they
petted
and
caressed
it
but
always
they
loved
it
here
was
the
ocean
yet
it
had
crept
under
the
dome
of
overhanging
rock
to
reveal
itself
crowned
with
sapphires
and
dressed
in
azure
gown
revealing
in
this
guise
new
and
unexpected
charms
good
morning
mayre
said
a
sweet
voice
trot
gave
a
start
and
looked
around
her
in
wonder
just
beside
her
in
the
water
were
little
eddies
circles
within
circles
such
as
are
caused
when
anything
sinks
below
the
surface
did
did
you
hear
that
bill
she
whispered
solemnly
bill
did
not
answer
he
was
staring
with
eyes
that
fairly
bulged
out
at
a
place
behind
trot
back
and
he
shook
a
little
as
if
trembling
from
cold
trot
turned
half
around
and
then
she
stared
too
rising
from
the
blue
water
was
a
fair
face
around
which
floated
a
mass
of
long
blonde
hair
it
was
a
sweet
girlish
face
with
eyes
of
the
same
deep
blue
as
the
water
and
red
lips
whose
dainty
smile
disposed
two
rows
of
pearly
teeth
the
cheeks
were
plump
and
rosy
the
brows
gracefully
penciled
while
the
chin
was
rounded
and
had
a
pretty
dimple
in
it
the
most
in
all
the
world
murmured
bill
in
a
voice
of
horror
an
no
one
has
ever
lived
to
to
tell
the
tale
there
was
a
peal
of
merry
laughter
at
this
laughter
that
rippled
and
echoed
throughout
the
cavern
just
at
trot
side
appeared
a
new
face
even
fairer
than
the
other
with
a
wealth
of
brown
hair
wreathing
the
lovely
features
and
the
eyes
smiled
kindly
into
those
of
the
child
are
you
a
a
mermaid
asked
trot
curiously
she
was
not
a
bit
afraid
they
seemed
both
gentle
and
friendly
yes
dear
was
the
soft
answer
we
are
all
mermaids
chimed
a
laughing
chorus
and
here
and
there
all
about
the
boat
appeared
pretty
faces
lying
just
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
are
you
part
fishes
asked
trot
greatly
pleased
by
this
wonderful
sight
no
we
are
all
mermaid
replied
the
one
with
the
brown
hair
the
fishes
are
partly
like
us
because
they
live
in
the
sea
and
must
move
about
and
you
are
partly
like
us
mayre
dear
but
have
awkward
stiff
legs
so
you
may
walk
on
the
land
but
the
mermaids
lived
before
fishes
and
before
mankind
so
both
have
borrowed
something
from
us
then
you
must
be
fairies
if
you
lived
always
remarked
trot
nodding
wisely
we
are
dear
we
are
the
water
fairies
answered
the
one
with
the
blonde
hair
coming
nearer
and
rising
till
her
slender
white
throat
showed
plainly
we
we
goners
trot
sighed
bill
with
a
white
woebegone
face
i
guess
not
she
answered
calmly
these
pretty
mermaids
are
going
to
hurt
us
i
sure
no
indeed
said
the
first
one
who
had
spoken
if
we
were
wicked
enough
to
wish
to
harm
you
our
magic
could
reach
you
as
easily
upon
the
land
as
in
this
cave
but
we
love
little
girls
dearly
and
wish
only
to
please
them
and
make
their
lives
more
happy
i
believe
that
cried
trot
earnestly
bill
groaned
guess
why
we
have
appeared
to
you
said
another
mermaid
coming
to
the
side
of
the
boat
why
asked
the
child
we
heard
you
say
yesterday
you
would
like
to
see
a
mermaid
and
so
we
decided
to
grant
your
wish
that
was
real
nice
of
you
said
trot
gratefully
also
we
heard
all
the
foolish
things
bill
said
about
us
remarked
the
one
smilingly
and
we
wanted
to
prove
to
him
that
they
were
wrong
i
said
what
i
heard
protested
bill
never
seen
a
mermaid
afore
i
could
be
ackerate
an
i
never
expected
to
see
one
an
live
to
tell
the
tale
again
the
cave
rang
with
merry
laughter
and
as
it
died
away
trot
said
may
i
see
your
scales
please
and
are
they
green
and
purple
and
pink
like
bill
said
they
seemed
undecided
what
to
say
to
this
and
swam
a
little
way
off
where
the
beautiful
heads
formed
a
group
that
was
delightful
to
see
perhaps
they
talked
together
for
the
mermaid
soon
came
back
to
the
side
of
the
boat
and
asked
would
you
like
to
visit
our
kingdom
and
see
all
the
wonders
that
exist
below
the
sea
i
like
to
replied
trot
promptly
but
i
could
i
get
drowned
that
you
would
mate
cried
bill
oh
no
said
the
mermaid
we
would
make
you
both
like
one
of
ourselves
and
then
you
could
live
within
the
water
as
easily
as
we
do
i
do
know
as
i
like
that
said
the
child
at
least
for
always
you
need
not
stay
with
us
a
moment
longer
than
you
please
returned
the
mermaid
smiling
as
if
amused
at
the
remark
whenever
you
are
ready
to
return
home
we
promise
to
bring
you
to
this
place
again
and
restore
to
you
the
same
forms
you
are
now
wearing
would
i
have
a
fish
tail
asked
trot
earnestly
you
would
have
a
mermaid
tail
was
the
reply
what
color
would
my
scales
be
pink
or
purple
you
may
choose
the
color
yourself
look
ahere
trot
said
bill
in
excitement
you
thinkin
o
doin
such
a
fool
thing
are
you
i
am
declared
the
little
girl
we
do
get
such
every
day
and
if
i
do
go
now
i
may
never
find
out
how
the
mermaids
live
i
do
care
how
they
live
myself
said
bill
i
jes
want
to
let
me
live
there
no
danger
insisted
trot
i
do
know
that
that
what
all
the
other
folks
said
when
they
dove
after
the
mermaids
an
got
drownded
who
asked
the
girl
i
do
know
who
but
i
heard
tell
you
heard
that
no
one
ever
saw
a
mermaid
and
lived
said
trot
to
tell
the
tale
he
added
nodding
an
if
we
dives
down
like
they
says
we
wo
live
ourselves
all
the
mermaids
laughed
at
this
and
the
one
said
well
if
you
are
afraid
do
come
you
may
row
your
boat
out
of
this
cave
and
never
see
us
again
if
you
like
we
merely
thought
it
would
please
little
mayre
and
were
willing
to
show
her
the
sights
of
our
beautiful
home
i
like
to
see
all
right
said
trot
her
eyes
glistening
with
pleasure
so
would
i
admitted
bill
if
we
would
live
to
tell
the
tale
do
you
believe
us
asked
the
mermaid
fixing
her
lovely
eyes
on
those
of
the
old
sailor
and
smiling
prettily
are
you
afraid
to
trust
us
to
bring
you
safely
back
said
bill
that
i
got
to
look
after
trot
then
you
have
to
come
with
me
said
trot
decidedly
for
going
to
this
if
you
do
care
to
come
bill
you
go
home
and
tell
mother
i
visitin
the
mermaids
she
scold
me
inter
shivers
moaned
bill
with
a
shudder
i
guess
i
ruther

my
chance
down
below
all
right
i
ready
miss
mermaid
said
trot
what
shall
i
do
jump
in
clothes
and
all
give
me
your
hand
dear
answered
the
mermaid
lifting
a
lovely
white
arm
from
the
water
trot
took
the
slender
hand
and
found
it
warm
and
soft
and
not
a
bit
fishy
my
name
is
clia
continued
the
mermaid
and
i
am
a
princess
in
our
kingdom
just
then
trot
gave
a
flop
and
flopped
right
out
of
the
boat
into
the
water
bill
caught
a
gleam
of
pink
scales
as
his
little
friend
went
overboard
and
the
next
moment
there
was
trot
face
in
the
water
among
those
of
the
mermaids
she
was
laughing
with
glee
as
she
looked
up
into
bill
face
and
called
come
on
in
it
did
hurt
a
bit
chapter
the
depths
of
the
deep
blue
sea
bill
stood
up
in
the
boat
as
if
undecided
what
to
do
never
a
sailor
man
was
more
bewildered
than
this
old
fellow
by
the
strangeness
of
the
adventure
he
had
encountered
at
first
he
could
hardly
believe
it
was
all
true
and
that
he
was
not
dreaming
but
there
was
trot
in
the
water
laughing
with
the
mermaids
and
floating
comfortably
about
and
he
could
leave
his
dear
little
companion
to
make
the
trip
to
the
depths
of
the
ocean
alone
take
my
hand
please
bill
said
princess
clia
reaching
her
dainty
arm
toward
him
and
suddenly
the
old
man
took
courage
and
clasped
the
soft
fingers
in
his
own
he
had
to
lean
over
the
boat
to
do
this
and
then
there
came
a
queer
lightness
to
his
legs
and
he
had
a
great
longing
to
be
in
the
water
so
he
gave
a
flop
and
flopped
in
beside
trot
where
he
found
himself
comfortable
enough
but
somewhat
frightened
law
sakes
he
gasped
here
me
in
the
water
with
my
rheumatics
i
be
that
stiff
termorrer
i
ca
wiggle
you
wigglin
all
right
now
observed
trot
that
a
fine
tail
you
got
an
its
green
scales
is
jus
beautiful
are
they
green
eh
he
asked
twisting
around
to
try
to
see
them
green
as
how
do
they
feel
feel
trot
feel
why
this
tail
beats
that
ol
wooden
leg
all
holler
i
kin
do
stunts
now
that
i
could
o
done
in
a
thousand
years
with
ol
peg
and
do
be
afraid
of
the
rheumatism
advised
the
princess
no
mermaid
ever
catches
cold
or
suffers
pain
in
the
water
is
bill
a
mermaid
now
asked
trot
why
he
a
merman
i
suppose
laughed
the
pretty
princess
but
when
he
gets
home
he
will
be
just
bill
again
wooden
leg
an
all
inquired
the
child
to
be
sure
my
dear
the
sailor
was
now
trying
his
newly
discovered
power
of
swimming
and
became
astonished
at
the
feats
he
could
accomplish
he
could
dart
this
way
and
that
with
wonderful
speed
and
turn
and
dive
and
caper
about
in
the
water
far
better
than
he
had
ever
been
able
to
do
on
land
even
before
he
got
the
wooden
leg
and
a
curious
thing
about
this
present
experience
was
that
the
water
did
not
cling
to
him
and
wet
him
as
it
had
always
done
before
he
still
wore
his
flannel
shirt
and
pea
jacket
and
his
sailor
cap
but
although
he
was
in
the
water
and
had
been
underneath
the
surface
the
cloth
still
seemed
dry
and
warm
as
he
dived
down
and
came
up
again
the
drops
flashed
from
his
head
and
the
fringe
of
beard
but
he
never
needed
to
wipe
his
face
or
eyes
at
all
trot
too
was
having
queer
experiences
and
enjoying
them
when
she
ducked
under
water
she
saw
plainly
everything
about
her
as
easily
and
distinctly
as
she
had
ever
seen
anything
above
water
and
by
looking
over
her
shoulder
she
could
watch
the
motion
of
her
new
tail
all
covered
with
pretty
iridescent
pink
scales
which
gleamed
like
jewels
she
wore
her
dress
the
same
as
before
and
the
water
failed
to
affect
it
in
the
least
she
now
noticed
that
the
mermaids
were
clothed
too
and
their
exquisite
gowns
were
the
loveliest
thing
the
little
girl
had
ever
beheld
they
seemed
made
of
a
material
that
was
like
sheeny
silk
cut
low
in
the
neck
and
with
wide
flowing
sleeves
that
seldom
covered
the
shapely
white
arms
of
her
new
friends
the
gowns
had
trains
that
floated
far
behind
the
mermaids
as
they
swam
but
were
so
fleecy
and
transparent
that
the
sparkle
of
their
scales
might
be
seen
reaching
back
of
their
waists
where
the
human
form
ended
and
the
fish
part
began
the
sea
fairies
wore
strings
of
splendid
pearls
twined
around
their
throats
while
more
pearls
were
sewn
upon
their
gowns
for
trimmings
they
did
not
dress
their
beautiful
hair
at
all
but
let
it
float
around
them
in
clouds
the
little
girl
had
scarcely
time
to
observe
all
this
when
the
princess
said
now
my
dear
if
you
are
ready
we
will
begin
our
journey
for
it
is
a
long
way
to
our
palaces
all
right
answered
trot
and
took
the
hand
extended
to
her
with
a
trustful
smile
will
you
allow
me
to
guide
you
bill
asked
the
blonde
mermaid
extending
her
hand
to
the
old
sailor
of
course
he
said
taking
her
fingers
rather
bashfully
my
name
is
merla
she
continued
and
i
am
cousin
to
princess
clia
we
must
all
keep
together
you
know
and
i
will
hold
your
hand
to
prevent
your
missing
the
way
while
she
spoke
they
began
to
descend
through
the
water
and
it
grew
quite
dark
for
a
time
because
the
cave
shut
out
the
light
but
presently
trot
who
was
eagerly
looking
around
her
began
to
notice
the
water
lighten
and
saw
they
were
coming
into
brighter
parts
of
the
sea
we
have
left
the
cave
now
said
clia
and
may
swim
straight
home
i
there
are
no
winding
roads
in
the
ocean
remarked
the
child
swimming
swiftly
beside
her
new
friend
oh
yes
indeed
at
the
bottom
the
way
is
far
from
being
straight
or
level
replied
clia
but
we
are
in
now
where
nothing
will
hinder
our
journey
unless
she
seemed
to
hesitate
so
trot
asked
unless
what
unless
we
meet
with
disagreeable
creatures
said
the
princess
the
is
not
as
safe
as
the
very
bottom
and
that
is
the
reason
we
are
holding
your
hands
what
good
would
that
do
asked
trot
you
must
remember
that
we
are
fairies
said
princess
clia
for
that
reason
nothing
in
the
ocean
can
injure
us
but
you
two
are
mortals
and
therefore
not
entirely
safe
at
all
times
unless
we
protect
you
trot
was
thoughtful
for
a
few
moments
and
looked
around
her
a
little
anxiously
now
and
then
a
dark
form
would
shoot
across
their
pathway
or
pass
them
at
some
distance
but
none
was
near
enough
for
the
girl
to
see
plainly
what
it
might
be
suddenly
they
swam
right
into
a
big
school
of
fishes
all
yellowtails
and
of
very
large
size
there
must
have
been
hundreds
of
them
lying
lazily
in
the
water
and
when
they
saw
the
mermaids
they
merely
wriggled
to
one
side
and
opened
a
path
for
the
sea
fairies
to
pass
through
will
they
hurt
us
asked
trot
no
indeed
laughed
the
princess
fishes
are
stupid
creatures
mostly
and
this
family
is
quite
harmless
how
about
sharks
asked
bill
who
was
swimming
gracefully
beside
them
his
hand
clutched
in
that
of
pretty
merla
sharks
may
indeed
be
dangerous
to
you
replied
clia
so
i
advise
you
to
keep
them
at
a
safe
distance
they
never
dare
attempt
to
bite
a
mermaid
and
it
may
be
they
will
think
you
belong
to
our
band
but
it
is
well
to
avoid
them
if
possible
do
get
careless
added
trot
i
surely
wo
mate
he
replied
you
see
i
did
use
to
be
o
sharks
if
they
came
near
i
stick
my
wooden
leg
at
but
now
if
they
happens
to
fancy
these
green
scales
it
all
up
with
ol
bill
never
fear
said
merla
i
take
care
of
you
on
our
journey
and
in
our
palaces
you
will
find
no
sharks
at
all
ca
they
get
in
he
asked
anxiously
no
the
palaces
of
the
mermaids
are
inhabited
only
by
themselves
is
there
anything
else
to
be
afraid
of
in
the
sea
asked
the
little
girl
after
they
had
swum
quite
a
while
in
silence
one
or
two
things
my
dear
answered
princess
clia
of
course
we
mermaids
have
great
powers
being
fairies
yet
among
the
sea
people
is
one
nearly
as
powerful
as
we
are
and
that
is
the
devilfish
i
know
said
trot
i
seen
you
have
seen
the
smaller
ones
i
suppose
which
sometimes
rise
to
the
surface
or
go
near
the
shore
and
are
often
caught
by
fishermen
said
clia
but
they
are
only
second
cousins
of
the
terrible
devilfish
to
which
i
refer
those
ones
are
bad
enough
though
declared
bill
if
you
know
any
worse
ones
i
do
want
a
interduction
to
the
monster
devilfish
inhabit
caves
in
the
rugged
mountainous
regions
of
the
ocean
resumed
the
princess
and
they
are
evil
spirits
who
delight
in
injuring
all
who
meet
them
none
lives
near
our
palaces
so
there
is
little
danger
of
your
meeting
any
while
you
are
our
guests
i
hope
we
wo
said
trot
none
for
me
added
bill
devils
of
any
sort
ought
to
be
give
a
wide
berth
an
devilfish
is
worser
ner
sea
serpents
oh
do
you
know
the
sea
serpents
asked
merla
as
if
surprised
not
much
i
do
answered
the
sailor
but
i
heard
tell
of
folks
as
has
seen
did
they
ever
live
to
tell
the
tale
asked
trot
sometimes
he
replied
they
jes
orful
creatures
mate
how
easy
it
is
to
be
mistaken
said
princess
clia
softly
we
know
the
sea
serpents
very
well
and
we
like
them
you
do
exclaimed
trot
yes
dear
there
are
only
three
of
them
in
all
the
world
and
not
only
are
they
harmless
but
quite
bashful
and
shy
they
are
too
and
although
not
beautiful
in
appearance
they
do
many
kind
deeds
and
are
generally
beloved
where
do
they
live
asked
the
child
the
oldest
one
who
is
king
of
this
ocean
lives
quite
near
us
said
clia
his
name
is
anko
how
old
is
he
inquired
bill
curiously
no
one
knows
he
was
here
before
the
ocean
came
and
he
stayed
here
because
he
learned
to
like
the
water
better
than
the
land
as
a
habitation
perhaps
king
anko
is
ten
thousand
years
old
perhaps
twenty
thousand
we
often
lose
track
of
the
centuries
down
here
in
the
sea
that
pretty
old
is
it
said
trot
older
than
bill
i
guess
summat
chuckled
the
sailor
man
summat
older
mate
but
not
much
the
sea
serpent
ai
got
gray
whiskers
oh
yes
he
has
responded
merla
with
a
laugh
and
so
have
his
two
brothers
unko
and
inko
they
each
have
an
ocean
of
their
own
you
know
and
once
every
hundred
years
they
come
here
to
visit
their
brother
anko
so
we
seen
all
three
many
times
why
how
old
are
mermaids
then
asked
trot
looking
around
at
the
beautiful
creatures
wonderingly
we
are
like
all
ladies
of
uncertain
age
rejoined
the
princess
with
a
smile
we
do
care
to
tell
older
than
bill
yes
dear
said
clia
but
we
have
any
gray
whiskers
added
merla
merrily
and
our
hearts
are
ever
young
trot
was
thoughtful
it
made
her
feel
solemn
to
be
in
the
company
of
such
old
people
the
band
of
mermaids
seemed
to
all
appearances
young
and
fresh
and
not
a
bit
as
if
they
been
soaked
in
water
for
hundreds
of
years
the
girl
began
to
take
more
notice
of
the
sea
maidens
following
after
her
more
than
a
dozen
were
in
the
group
all
were
lovely
in
appearance
and
clothed
in
the
same
gauzy
robes
as
merla
and
the
princess
these
attendants
did
not
join
in
the
conversation
but
darted
here
and
there
in
sportive
play
and
often
trot
heard
the
tinkling
chorus
of
their
laughter
whatever
doubts
might
have
arisen
in
the
child
mind
through
the
ignorant
tales
of
her
sailor
friend
she
now
found
the
mermaids
to
be
joyous
and
gay
and
from
the
first
she
had
not
been
in
the
least
afraid
of
her
new
companions
how
much
farther
do
we
have
to
go
asked
bill
presently
are
you
getting
tired
merla
inquired
no
said
he
but
i
sorter
anxious
to
see
what
your
palaces
look
like
inside
the
water
ai
as
interestin
as
the
top
of
it
fine
swimmin
i
agree
an
i
like
it
but
there
ai
special
to
see
that
i
can
make
out
that
is
true
sir
replied
the
princess
we
have
purposely
led
you
through
the
hoping
you
would
see
nothing
to
alarm
you
until
you
get
more
accustomed
to
our
ocean
life
moreover
we
are
able
to
travel
more
swiftly
here
how
far
do
you
think
we
have
already
come
oh
two
mile
he
answered
well
we
are
now
hundreds
of
miles
from
the
cave
where
we
started
she
told
him
you
do
mean
it
he
exclaimed
in
wonder
then
there
magic
in
it
announced
trot
soberly
true
my
dear
to
avoid
tiring
you
and
to
save
time
we
have
used
a
little
of
our
fairy
power
said
clia
the
result
is
that
we
are
nearing
our
home
let
us
go
downward
a
bit
now
for
you
must
know
that
the
mermaid
palaces
are
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
ocean
and
in
its
deepest
part
chapter
the
palace
of
queen
aquareine
trot
was
surprised
to
find
it
was
not
at
all
dark
or
gloomy
as
they
descended
farther
into
the
deep
sea
things
were
not
quite
so
clear
to
her
eyes
as
they
had
been
in
the
bright
sunshine
above
the
ocean
surface
but
every
object
was
distinct
nevertheless
as
if
she
saw
through
a
pane
of
glass
the
water
was
very
clear
except
for
this
green
shading
and
the
little
girl
had
never
before
felt
so
light
and
buoyant
as
she
did
now
it
was
no
effort
at
all
to
dart
through
the
water
which
seemed
to
support
her
on
all
sides
i
do
believe
i
weigh
anything
at
all
she
said
to
bill
no
more
do
i
trot
said
he
but
that
seein
as
under
water
so
far
what
bothers
me
most
is
how
we
manage
to
breathe
havin
no
gills
like
fishes
have
are
you
sure
we
have
any
gills
she
asked
lifting
her
free
hand
to
feel
her
throat
sure
ner
the
mermaids
have
any
either
declared
bill
then
said
trot
we
breathing
by
magic
the
mermaids
laughed
at
this
shrewd
remark
and
the
princess
said
you
have
guessed
correctly
my
dear
go
a
little
slower
now
for
the
palaces
are
in
sight
where
asked
trot
eagerly
just
before
you
in
that
grove
of
trees
inquired
the
girl
and
really
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
were
approaching
a
beautiful
grove
the
bottom
of
the
sea
was
covered
with
white
sand
in
which
grew
many
varieties
of
sea
shrubs
with
branches
like
those
of
trees
not
all
of
them
were
green
however
for
the
branches
and
leaves
were
of
a
variety
of
gorgeous
colors
some
were
purple
shading
down
to
a
light
lavender
and
there
were
reds
all
the
way
from
a
delicate
to
vivid
shades
of
scarlet
orange
yellow
and
blue
shades
were
there
too
mingling
with
the
in
a
most
charming
manner
altogether
trot
found
the
brilliant
coloring
somewhat
bewildering
these
sea
shrubs
which
in
size
were
quite
as
big
and
tall
as
the
trees
on
earth
were
set
so
close
together
that
their
branches
entwined
but
there
were
several
avenues
leading
into
the
groves
and
at
the
entrance
to
each
avenue
the
girl
noticed
several
large
fishes
with
long
spikes
growing
upon
their
noses
those
are
swordfishes
remarked
the
princess
as
she
led
the
band
past
one
of
these
avenues
are
they
asked
trot
not
to
us
was
the
reply
the
swordfishes
are
among
our
most
valued
and
faithful
servants
guarding
the
entrances
to
the
gardens
which
surround
our
palaces
if
any
creatures
try
to
enter
uninvited
these
guards
fight
them
and
drive
them
away
their
swords
are
sharp
and
strong
and
they
are
fierce
fighters
i
assure
you
i
known
to
attack
ships
an
stick
their
swords
right
through
the
wood
said
bill
those
belonged
to
the
wandering
tribes
of
swordfishes
explained
the
princess
these
who
are
our
servants
are
too
sensible
and
intelligent
to
attack
ships
the
band
now
headed
into
a
broad
passage
through
the
gardens
as
the
mermaids
called
these
gorgeous
groves
and
the
great
swordfishes
guarding
the
entrance
made
way
for
them
to
pass
afterward
resuming
their
posts
with
watchful
eyes
as
they
slowly
swam
along
the
avenue
trot
noticed
that
some
of
the
bushes
seemed
to
have
fruits
growing
upon
them
but
what
these
fruits
might
be
neither
she
nor
bill
could
guess
the
way
wound
here
and
there
for
some
distance
till
finally
they
came
to
a
more
open
space
all
carpeted
with
sea
flowers
of
exquisite
colorings
although
trot
did
not
know
it
these
flowers
resembled
the
rare
orchids
of
earth
in
their
fanciful
shapes
and
marvelous
hues
the
child
did
not
examine
them
very
closely
for
across
the
carpet
of
flowers
loomed
the
magnificent
and
extensive
palaces
of
the
mermaids
these
palaces
were
built
of
coral
white
pink
and
yellow
being
used
and
the
colors
arranged
in
graceful
designs
the
front
of
the
main
palace
which
now
faced
them
had
circular
ends
connecting
the
straight
wall
not
unlike
the
architecture
we
are
all
familiar
with
yet
there
seemed
to
be
no
windows
to
the
building
although
a
series
of
archways
served
as
doors
arriving
at
one
of
the
central
archways
the
band
of
sea
maidens
separated
princess
clia
and
merla
leading
trot
and
bill
into
the
palace
while
the
other
mermaids
swam
swiftly
away
to
their
own
quarters
welcome
said
clia
in
her
sweet
voice
here
you
are
surrounded
only
by
friends
and
are
in
perfect
safety
please
accept
our
hospitality
as
freely
as
you
desire
for
we
consider
you
honored
guests
i
hope
you
will
like
our
home
she
added
a
little
shyly
we
are
sure
to
dear
princess
trot
hastened
to
say
then
clia
escorted
them
through
the
archway
and
into
a
lofty
hall
it
was
not
a
mere
grotto
but
had
smoothly
built
walls
of
pink
coral
inlaid
with
white
trot
at
first
thought
there
was
no
roof
for
looking
upward
she
could
see
the
water
all
above
them
but
the
princess
reading
her
thought
said
with
a
smile
yes
there
is
a
roof
or
we
would
be
unable
to
keep
all
the
sea
people
out
of
our
palace
but
the
roof
is
made
of
glass
to
admit
the
light
glass
cried
the
astonished
child
then
it
must
be
an
awful
big
pane
of
glass
it
is
agreed
clia
our
roofs
are
considered
quite
wonderful
and
we
owe
them
to
the
fairy
powers
of
our
queen
of
course
you
understand
there
is
no
natural
way
to
make
glass
under
water
no
indeed
said
bill
and
then
he
asked
does
your
queen
live
here
yes
she
is
waiting
now
in
her
throne
room
to
welcome
you
shall
we
go
in
i
just
as
soon
replied
trot
rather
timidly
but
she
boldly
followed
the
princess
who
glided
through
another
arch
into
another
small
room
where
several
mermaids
were
reclining
upon
couches
of
coral
they
were
beautifully
dressed
and
wore
many
sparkling
jewels
her
majesty
is
awaiting
the
strangers
princess
clia
announced
one
of
these
you
are
asked
to
enter
at
once
come
then
said
clia
and
once
more
taking
trot
hand
she
led
the
girl
through
still
another
arch
while
merla
followed
just
behind
them
escorting
bill
they
now
entered
an
apartment
so
gorgeous
that
the
child
fairly
gasped
with
astonishment
the
throne
room
was
indeed
the
grandest
and
most
beautiful
chamber
in
all
the
ocean
palaces
its
coral
walls
were
thickly
inlaid
with
exquisitely
shaded
and
made
into
borders
and
floral
decorations
in
the
corners
were
cabinets
upon
the
shelves
of
which
many
curious
shells
were
arranged
all
beautifully
polished
the
floor
glittered
with
gems
arranged
in
patterns
of
flowers
like
a
brilliant
carpet
near
the
center
of
the
room
was
a
raised
platform
of
upon
which
stood
a
couch
thickly
studded
with
diamonds
rubies
emeralds
and
pearls
here
reclined
queen
aquareine
a
being
so
lovely
that
trot
gazed
upon
her
spellbound
and
bill
took
off
his
sailor
cap
and
held
it
in
his
hands
all
about
the
room
were
grouped
other
couches
not
raised
like
that
of
the
queen
and
upon
each
of
these
reclined
a
pretty
mermaid
they
could
not
sit
down
as
we
do
trot
readily
understood
because
of
their
tails
but
they
rested
very
gracefully
upon
the
couches
with
their
trailing
gauzy
robes
arranged
in
fleecy
folds
when
clia
and
merla
escorted
the
strangers
down
the
length
of
the
great
room
toward
the
royal
throne
they
met
with
pleasant
looks
and
smiles
on
every
side
for
the
sea
maidens
were
too
polite
to
indulge
in
curious
stares
they
paused
just
before
the
throne
and
the
queen
raised
her
head
upon
one
elbow
to
observe
them
welcome
mayre
she
said
and
welcome
bill
i
trust
you
are
pleased
with
your
glimpse
of
the
life
beneath
the
surface
of
our
sea
i
am
answered
trot
looking
admiringly
at
the
beautiful
face
of
the
queen
it
all
mighty
an
said
the
sailor
slowly
i
no
idee
you
mermaids
were
like
this
at
all
allow
me
to
explain
that
it
was
to
correct
your
wrong
ideas
about
us
that
led
me
to
invite
you
to
visit
us
replied
the
queen
we
usually
pay
little
heed
to
the
earth
people
for
we
are
content
in
our
own
dominions
but
of
course
we
know
all
that
goes
on
upon
your
earth
so
when
princess
clia
chanced
to
overhear
your
absurd
statements
concerning
us
we
were
greatly
amused
and
decided
to
let
you
see
with
your
own
eyes
just
what
we
are
like
i
glad
you
did
answered
bill
dropping
his
eyes
in
some
confusion
as
he
remembered
his
former
description
of
the
mermaids
now
that
you
are
here
continued
the
queen
in
a
cordial
friendly
tone
you
may
as
well
remain
with
us
a
few
days
and
see
the
wonderful
sights
of
our
ocean
i
much
obliged
to
you
said
trot
and
i
like
to
stay
ever
so
much
but
mother
worries
jus
dreadfully
if
we
do
get
home
in
time
i
arrange
all
that
said
aquareine
with
a
smile
how
asked
the
girl
i
will
make
your
mother
forget
the
passage
of
time
so
she
will
not
realize
how
long
you
are
away
then
she
can
not
worry
can
you
do
that
inquired
trot
very
easily
i
will
send
your
mother
into
a
deep
sleep
that
will
last
until
you
are
ready
to
return
home
just
at
present
she
is
seated
in
her
chair
by
the
front
window
engaged
in
knitting
the
queen
paused
to
raise
an
arm
and
wave
it
slowly
to
and
fro
then
she
added
now
your
good
mother
is
asleep
little
mayre
and
instead
of
worries
i
promise
her
pleasant
dreams
wo
someone
rob
the
house
while
she
asleep
asked
the
child
anxiously
no
dear
my
charm
will
protect
the
house
from
any
intrusion
that
fine
exclaimed
trot
in
delight
it
jes
said
bill
i
wish
i
knew
it
was
so
trot
mother
has
a
awful
sharp
tongue
when
she
worried
you
may
see
for
yourselves
declared
the
queen
and
waved
her
hand
again
at
once
they
saw
before
them
the
room
in
the
cottage
with
mayre
mother
asleep
by
the
window
her
knitting
was
in
her
lap
and
the
cat
lay
curled
up
beside
her
chair
it
was
all
so
natural
that
trot
thought
she
could
hear
the
clock
over
the
fireplace
tick
after
a
moment
the
scene
faded
away
when
the
queen
asked
with
another
smile
are
you
satisfied
oh
yes
cried
trot
but
how
could
you
do
it
it
is
a
form
of
mirage
was
the
reply
we
are
able
to
bring
any
earth
scene
before
us
whenever
we
wish
sometimes
these
scenes
are
reflected
above
the
water
so
that
mortals
also
observe
them
i
seen
said
bill
nodding
i
seen
mirages
but
i
never
knowed
what
caused
afore
now
whenever
you
see
anything
you
do
not
understand
and
wish
to
ask
questions
i
will
be
very
glad
to
answer
them
said
the
queen
one
thing
that
bothers
me
said
trot
is
why
we
do
get
wet
being
in
the
ocean
with
water
all
around
us
that
is
because
no
water
really
touches
you
explained
the
queen
your
bodies
have
been
made
just
like
those
of
the
mermaids
in
order
that
you
may
fully
enjoy
your
visit
to
us
one
of
our
peculiar
qualities
is
that
water
is
never
permitted
to
quite
touch
our
bodies
or
our
gowns
always
there
remains
a
very
small
space
hardly
a
hair
breadth
between
us
and
the
water
which
is
the
reason
we
are
always
warm
and
dry
i
see
said
trot
that
why
you
do
get
soggy
or
withered
exactly
laughed
the
queen
and
the
other
mermaids
joined
in
her
merriment
i
that
how
we
can
breathe
without
gills
remarked
bill
thoughtfully
yes
the
air
space
is
constantly
replenished
from
the
water
which
contains
air
and
this
enables
us
to
breathe
as
freely
as
you
do
upon
the
earth
but
we
have
fins
said
trot
looking
at
the
fin
that
stood
upright
on
bill
back
yes
they
allow
us
to
guide
ourselves
as
we
swim
and
so
are
very
useful
replied
the
queen
they
make
us
more
finished
said
bill
with
a
chuckle
then
suddenly
becoming
grave
he
added
how
about
my
rheumatics
ai
i
likely
to
get
stiffened
up
with
all
this
dampness
no
indeed
aquareine
answered
there
is
no
such
thing
as
rheumatism
in
all
our
dominions
i
promise
no
evil
result
shall
follow
this
visit
to
us
so
please
be
as
happy
and
contented
as
possible
chapter
the
just
then
trot
happened
to
look
up
at
the
glass
roof
and
saw
a
startling
sight
a
big
head
with
a
face
surrounded
by
stubby
gray
whiskers
was
poised
just
over
them
and
the
head
was
connected
with
a
long
curved
body
that
looked
much
like
a
sewer
pipe
oh
there
is
king
anko
said
the
queen
following
the
gaze
open
a
door
and
let
him
in
clia
for
i
suppose
our
old
friend
is
anxious
to
see
the
earth
people
wo
he
hurt
us
asked
the
little
girl
with
a
shiver
of
fear
who
anko
oh
no
my
dear
we
are
very
fond
of
the
sea
serpent
who
is
king
of
this
ocean
although
he
does
not
rule
the
mermaids
old
anko
is
a
very
agreeable
fellow
as
you
will
soon
discover
can
he
talk
asked
trot
yes
indeed
and
can
we
understand
what
he
says
perfectly
replied
the
queen
i
have
given
you
power
while
you
remain
here
to
understand
the
language
of
every
inhabitant
of
the
sea
that
nice
said
trot
gratefully
the
princess
clia
swam
slowly
to
one
of
the
walls
of
the
throne
room
where
at
a
wave
of
her
hand
a
round
hole
appeared
in
the
coral
the
sea
serpent
at
once
observed
this
opening
and
the
head
left
the
roof
of
glass
only
to
reappear
presently
at
the
round
hole
through
this
he
slowly
crawled
until
his
head
was
just
beneath
the
throne
of
queen
aquareine
who
said
to
him
good
morning
your
majesty
i
hope
you
are
quite
well
quite
well
thank
your
majesty
answered
anko
and
then
he
turned
to
the
strangers
i
suppose
these
are
the
earth
folks
you
were
expecting
yes
returned
the
queen
the
girl
is
named
mayre
and
the
man
bill
while
the
sea
serpent
looked
at
the
visitors
they
ventured
to
look
at
him
he
certainly
was
a
queer
creature
yet
trot
decided
he
was
not
at
all
frightful
his
head
was
round
as
a
ball
but
his
ears
were
and
had
tassels
at
the
ends
of
them
his
nose
was
flat
and
his
mouth
very
wide
indeed
but
his
eyes
were
blue
and
gentle
in
expression
the
white
stubby
hairs
that
surrounded
his
face
were
not
thick
like
a
beard
but
scattered
and
scraggly
from
the
head
the
long
brown
body
of
the
sea
serpent
extended
to
the
hole
in
the
coral
wall
which
was
just
big
enough
to
admit
it
and
how
much
more
of
the
body
remained
outside
the
child
could
not
tell
on
the
back
of
the
body
were
several
fins
which
made
the
creature
look
more
like
an
eel
than
a
serpent
the
girl
is
young
and
the
man
is
old
said
king
anko
in
a
soft
voice
but
i
quite
sure
bill
is
as
old
as
i
am
how
old
are
you
asked
the
sailor
i
ca
say
exactly
i
can
remember
several
thousands
of
years
back
but
beyond
that
my
memory
fails
me
how
your
memory
bill
you
got
me
beat
was
the
reply
i
give
in
that
you
older
than
i
am
this
seemed
to
please
the
sea
serpent
are
you
well
he
asked
pretty
fair
said
bill
how
yourself
oh
i
very
well
thank
you
answered
anko
i
never
remember
to
have
had
a
pain
but
three
times
in
my
life
the
last
time
was
when
julius
sneezer
was
on
earth
you
mean
julius
caesar
said
trot
correcting
him
no
i
mean
julius
sneezer
insisted
the
sea
serpent
that
was
his
real
name
sneezer
they
called
him
caesar
sometimes
just
because
he
took
everything
he
could
lay
hands
on
i
ought
to
know
because
i
saw
him
when
he
was
alive
did
you
see
him
when
he
was
alive
bill
i
reckon
not
admitted
the
sailor
that
time
i
had
a
toothache
continued
anko
but
i
got
a
lobster
to
pull
the
tooth
with
his
claw
so
the
pain
was
soon
over
did
it
hurt
to
pull
it
asked
trot
hurt
exclaimed
the
sea
serpent
groaning
at
the
recollection
my
dear
those
creatures
have
been
called
lobsters
ever
since
the
second
pain
i
had
way
back
in
the
time
of
nevercouldnever
oh
i
you
mean
nebuchadnezzar
said
trot
do
you
call
him
that
now
asked
the
sea
serpent
as
if
surprised
he
used
to
be
called
nevercouldnever
when
he
was
alive
but
this
new
way
of
spelling
seems
to
get
everything
mixed
up
nebuchadnezzar
does
mean
anything
at
all
it
seems
to
me
it
means
he
ate
grass
said
the
child
oh
no
he
did
declared
the
sea
serpent
he
was
the
first
to
discover
that
lettuce
was
good
to
eat
and
he
became
very
fond
of
it
the
people
may
have
called
it
grass
but
they
were
wrong
i
ought
to
know
because
i
was
alive
when
nevercouldnever
lived
were
you
alive
then
no
said
trot
the
pain
i
had
then
remarked
anko
was
caused
by
a
kink
in
my
tail
about
three
hundred
feet
from
the
end
there
was
an
old
octopus
who
did
not
like
me
and
so
he
tied
a
knot
in
my
tail
when
i
looking
what
did
you
do
asked
bill
well
first
i
transformed
the
octopus
into
a
jellyfish
and
then
i
waited
for
the
tide
to
turn
when
my
tail
was
untied
the
pain
stopped
i
i
do
understand
that
said
trot
somewhat
bewildered
thank
you
my
dear
replied
the
sea
serpent
in
a
grateful
voice
people
who
are
always
understood
are
very
common
you
are
sure
to
respect
those
you
ca
understand
for
you
feel
that
perhaps
they
know
more
than
you
do
about
how
long
do
you
happen
to
be
inquired
bill
when
last
measured
i
was
seven
thousand
four
hundred
and
feet
five
inches
and
a
quarter
i
not
sure
about
the
quarter
but
the
rest
is
probably
correct
adam
measured
me
when
cain
was
a
baby
where
the
rest
of
you
then
asked
trot
safe
at
home
i
hope
and
coiled
up
in
my
parlor
answered
the
sea
serpent
when
i
go
out
i
usually
take
along
only
what
is
needed
it
saves
a
lot
of
bother
and
i
can
always
find
my
way
back
in
the
darkest
night
by
just
coiling
up
the
part
that
has
been
away
do
you
like
to
be
a
sea
serpent
inquired
the
child
yes
for
i
king
of
my
ocean
and
there
is
no
other
sea
serpent
to
imagine
he
is
just
as
good
as
i
am
i
have
two
brothers
who
live
in
other
oceans
but
one
is
seven
inches
shorter
than
i
am
and
the
other
several
feet
shorter
it
curious
to
talk
about
feet
when
we
have
any
feet
is
it
seems
so
acknowledged
trot
i
feel
i
have
much
to
be
proud
of
continued
anko
in
a
dreamy
tone
my
great
age
my
undisputed
sway
and
my
exceptional
length
i
do
i
care
to
live
so
long
remarked
bill
thoughtfully
so
long
as
seven
thousand
four
hundred
and
feet
five
inches
and
a
quarter
asked
the
sea
serpent
no
i
mean
so
many
years
replied
the
sailor
but
what
can
one
do
if
one
happens
to
be
a
sea
serpent
anko
inquired
there
is
nothing
in
the
sea
that
can
hurt
me
and
i
can
not
commit
suicide
because
we
have
no
carbolic
acid
or
firearms
or
gas
to
turn
on
so
it
is
a
matter
of
choice
and
i
about
as
soon
be
alive
as
dead
it
does
not
seem
quite
so
monotonous
you
know
but
i
guess
i
stayed
about
long
enough
so
i
go
home
to
dinner
come
and
see
me
when
you
have
time
thank
you
said
trot
and
merla
added
i
take
you
over
to
his
majesty
palace
when
we
go
out
and
let
you
see
how
he
lives
yes
do
said
anko
and
then
he
slowly
slid
out
of
the
hole
which
immediately
closed
behind
him
leaving
the
coral
wall
as
solid
as
before
oh
exclaimed
trot
king
anko
forgot
to
tell
us
what
his
third
pain
was
about
so
he
did
said
bill
we
must
ask
him
about
that
when
we
see
him
but
i
guess
the
ol
boy
is
failin
an
he
be
depended
on
for
chapter
exploring
the
ocean
the
queen
now
requested
her
guests
to
recline
upon
couches
that
they
might
rest
themselves
from
their
long
swim
and
talk
more
at
their
ease
so
the
girl
and
the
sailor
allowed
themselves
to
float
downward
until
they
rested
their
bodies
on
two
of
the
couches
nearest
the
throne
which
were
willingly
vacated
for
them
by
the
mermaids
who
occupied
them
until
then
the
visitors
soon
found
themselves
answering
a
great
many
questions
about
their
life
on
the
earth
for
although
the
queen
had
said
she
kept
track
of
what
was
going
on
on
the
land
there
were
many
details
of
human
life
in
which
all
the
mermaids
seemed
greatly
interested
during
the
conversation
several
came
swimming
into
the
room
bearing
trays
of
sea
apples
and
other
fruit
which
they
first
offered
to
the
queen
and
then
passed
the
refreshments
around
to
the
company
assembled
trot
and
bill
each
took
some
and
the
little
girl
found
the
fruits
delicious
to
eat
as
they
had
a
richer
flavor
than
any
that
grew
upon
land
queen
aquareine
was
much
pleased
when
the
old
sailor
asked
for
more
but
merla
warned
him
dinner
would
soon
be
served
and
he
must
take
care
not
to
spoil
his
appetite
for
that
meal
our
dinner
is
at
noon
for
we
have
to
cook
in
the
middle
of
the
day
when
the
sun
is
shining
she
said
cook
cried
trot
why
you
ca
build
a
fire
in
the
water
can
you
we
have
no
need
of
fires
was
the
reply
the
glass
roof
of
our
kitchen
is
so
curved
that
it
concentrates
the
heat
of
the
rays
which
are
then
hot
enough
to
cook
anything
we
wish
but
how
do
you
get
along
if
the
day
is
cloudy
and
the
sun
shine
inquired
the
little
girl
then
we
use
the
hot
springs
that
bubble
up
in
another
part
of
the
palace
merla
answered
but
the
sun
is
the
best
to
cook
by
so
it
was
no
surprise
to
trot
when
about
noon
dinner
was
announced
and
all
the
mermaids
headed
by
their
queen
and
their
guests
swam
into
another
spacious
room
where
a
great
long
table
was
laid
the
dishes
were
of
polished
gold
and
glass
and
the
cloth
and
napkins
of
fine
gossamer
around
the
table
were
ranged
rows
of
couches
for
the
mermaids
to
recline
upon
as
they
ate
only
the
nobility
and
favorites
of
queen
aquareine
were
invited
to
partake
of
this
repast
for
clia
explained
that
tables
were
set
for
the
other
mermaids
in
different
parts
of
the
numerous
palaces
trot
wondered
who
would
serve
the
meal
but
her
curiosity
was
soon
satisfied
when
several
large
lobsters
came
sliding
into
the
room
backward
bearing
in
their
claws
trays
loaded
with
food
each
of
these
lobsters
had
a
golden
band
behind
its
neck
to
show
it
was
the
slave
of
the
mermaids
these
curious
waiters
were
fussy
creatures
and
trot
found
much
amusement
in
watching
their
odd
motions
they
were
so
spry
and
excitable
that
at
times
they
ran
against
one
another
and
upset
the
platters
of
food
after
which
they
began
to
scold
and
argue
as
to
whose
fault
it
was
until
one
of
the
mermaids
quietly
rebuked
them
and
asked
them
to
be
more
quiet
and
more
careful
the
queen
guests
had
no
cause
to
complain
of
the
dinner
provided
first
the
lobsters
served
bowls
of
turtle
soup
which
proved
hot
and
deliciously
flavored
then
came
salmon
steaks
fried
in
fish
oil
with
a
fungus
bread
that
tasted
much
like
field
mushrooms
oysters
clams
crabs
and
various
preparations
of
seafoods
followed
the
salad
was
a
delicate
leaf
from
some
seaweed
that
trot
thought
was
much
nicer
than
lettuce
several
courses
were
served
and
the
lobsters
changed
the
plates
with
each
course
chattering
and
scolding
as
they
worked
and
as
trot
said
doing
everything
backwards
in
their
nervous
fussy
way
many
of
the
things
offered
them
to
eat
were
unknown
to
the
visitors
and
the
child
was
suspicious
of
some
of
them
but
bill
asked
no
questions
and
ate
everything
offered
him
so
trot
decided
to
follow
his
example
certain
it
is
they
found
the
meal
very
satisfying
and
evidently
there
was
no
danger
of
their
being
hungry
while
they
remained
the
guests
of
the
mermaids
when
the
fruits
came
trot
thought
that
must
be
the
last
course
of
the
big
dinner
but
following
the
fruits
were
ice
creams
frozen
into
the
shape
of
flowers
how
funny
said
the
child
to
be
eating
ice
cream
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
why
does
that
surprise
you
inquired
the
queen
i
ca
see
where
you
get
the
ice
to
freeze
it
trot
replied
it
is
brought
to
us
from
the
icebergs
that
float
in
the
northern
parts
of
the
ocean
explained
merla
o
course
trot
you
orter
thought
o
that
i
did
said
bill
the
little
girl
was
glad
there
was
no
more
to
eat
for
she
was
ashamed
to
feel
she
had
eaten
every
morsel
she
could
her
only
excuse
for
being
so
greedy
was
that
tasted
just
splendid
as
she
told
the
queen
and
now
said
aquareine
i
will
send
you
out
for
a
swim
with
merla
who
will
show
you
some
of
the
curious
sights
of
our
sea
you
need
not
go
far
this
afternoon
and
when
you
return
we
will
have
another
interesting
talk
together
so
the
blonde
mermaid
led
trot
and
bill
outside
the
palace
walls
where
they
found
themselves
in
the
pretty
flower
gardens
i
feel
all
right
mate
if
i
could
have
a
smoke
remarked
the
old
sailor
to
the
child
but
that
a
thing
as
ca
be
did
here
in
the
water
why
not
asked
merla
who
overheard
him
a
pipe
has
to
be
lighted
an
a
match
would
burn
he
replied
try
it
suggested
the
mermaid
i
do
not
mind
your
smoking
at
all
if
it
will
give
you
pleasure
it
a
bad
habit
i
got
an
i
too
old
to
break
myself
of
it
said
bill
then
he
felt
in
the
big
pocket
of
his
coat
and
took
out
a
pipe
and
a
bag
of
tobacco
after
he
had
carefully
filled
his
pipe
rejoicing
in
the
fact
that
the
tobacco
was
not
at
all
wet
he
took
out
his
matchbox
and
struck
a
light
the
match
burned
brightly
and
soon
the
sailor
was
puffing
the
smoke
from
his
pipe
in
great
contentment
the
smoke
ascended
through
the
water
in
the
shape
of
bubbles
and
trot
wondered
what
anyone
who
happened
to
be
floating
upon
the
surface
of
the
ocean
would
think
to
see
smoke
coming
from
the
water
well
i
find
i
can
smoke
all
right
remarked
bill
but
it
bothers
me
to
understand
why
it
is
because
of
the
air
space
existing
between
the
water
and
everything
you
have
about
you
explained
merla
but
now
if
you
will
come
this
way
i
will
take
you
to
visit
some
of
our
neighbors
they
passed
over
the
carpet
of
sea
flowers
the
gorgeous
blossoms
swaying
on
their
stems
as
the
motion
of
the
people
in
the
water
above
them
disturbed
their
repose
and
presently
the
three
entered
the
dense
shrubbery
surrounding
the
palace
they
had
not
proceeded
far
when
they
came
to
a
clearing
among
the
bushes
and
here
merla
paused
trot
and
bill
paused
too
for
floating
in
the
clear
water
was
a
group
of
beautiful
shapes
that
the
child
thought
looked
like
molds
of
wine
jelly
they
were
round
as
a
dinner
plate
soft
and
transparent
but
tinted
in
such
lovely
hues
that
no
artist
brush
has
ever
been
able
to
imitate
them
some
were
deep
sapphire
blue
others
rose
pink
still
others
a
delicate
topaz
color
they
seemed
to
have
neither
heads
eyes
nor
ears
yet
it
was
easy
to
see
they
were
alive
and
able
to
float
in
any
direction
they
wished
to
go
in
shape
they
resembled
inverted
flowerpots
with
the
upper
edges
fluted
and
from
the
centers
floated
what
seemed
to
be
bouquets
of
flowers
how
pretty
exclaimed
trot
enraptured
by
the
sight
yes
this
is
a
rare
variety
of
jellyfish
replied
merla
the
creatures
are
not
so
delicate
as
they
appear
and
live
for
a
long
time
unless
they
get
too
near
the
surface
and
the
waves
wash
them
ashore
after
watching
the
jellyfish
a
few
moments
they
followed
merla
through
the
grove
and
soon
a
low
chant
like
that
of
an
indian
song
fell
upon
their
ears
it
was
a
chorus
of
many
small
voices
and
grew
louder
as
they
swam
on
presently
a
big
rock
rose
suddenly
before
them
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
rearing
its
steep
side
far
up
into
the
water
overhead
and
this
rock
was
thickly
covered
with
tiny
shells
that
clung
fast
to
its
surface
the
chorus
they
heard
appeared
to
come
from
these
shells
and
merla
said
to
her
companions
these
are
the
singing
barnacles
they
are
really
very
amusing
and
if
you
listen
carefully
you
can
hear
what
they
say
so
trot
and
bill
listened
and
this
is
what
the
barnacles
sang
we
went
to
land
to
see
a
and
we
were
much
attached
to
it
because
we
simply
were
we
found
an
within
the
mud
upon
the
lea
for
the
ghost
of
jonah
whale
he
ran
away
and
went
to
sea
oh
it
was
awful
it
was
unlawful
we
rallied
round
the
flag
in
millions
they
could
shake
us
they
had
to
take
us
so
the
halibut
and
cod
they
danced
cotillions
what
does
it
all
mean
asked
trot
i
suppose
they
refer
to
the
way
barnacles
have
of
clinging
to
ships
replied
merla
but
usually
the
songs
mean
nothing
at
all
the
little
barnacles
have
many
brains
so
we
usually
find
their
songs
quite
stupid
do
they
write
some
comic
operas
asked
the
child
i
think
not
answered
the
mermaid
they
seem
to
like
the
songs
themselves
remarked
bill
oh
yes
they
sing
all
day
long
but
it
never
matters
to
them
whether
their
songs
mean
anything
or
not
let
us
go
in
this
direction
and
visit
some
other
sea
people
so
they
swam
away
from
the
rock
and
trot
heard
the
last
chorus
as
she
slowly
followed
their
conductor
the
barnacles
were
singing
oh
very
well
then
i
hear
the
curfew
please
go
away
and
come
some
other
day
goliath
tussels
with
samson
muscles
yet
the
muscles
never
fight
in
oyster
bay
it
jus
nonsense
said
trot
scornfully
why
do
they
sing
laurie
or
sweet
home
or
else
keep
quiet
why
if
they
were
quiet
replied
merla
they
would
be
singing
barnacles
they
now
came
to
one
of
the
avenues
which
led
from
the
sea
garden
out
into
the
broad
ocean
and
here
two
swordfishes
were
standing
guard
is
all
quiet
merla
asked
them
just
as
usual
your
highness
replied
one
of
the
guards
mummercubble
was
sick
this
morning
and
grunted
dreadfully
but
better
now
and
has
gone
to
sleep
king
anko
has
been
stirring
around
some
but
is
now
taking
his
nap
i
think
it
will
be
perfectly
safe
for
you
to
swim
out
for
a
while
if
you
wish
who
mummercubble
asked
trot
as
they
passed
out
into
deep
water
he
the
sea
pig
replied
merla
i
am
glad
he
asleep
for
now
we
wo
meet
him
do
you
like
him
inquired
trot
oh
he
complains
so
bitterly
of
everything
that
he
bores
us
merla
answered
mummercubble
is
never
contented
or
happy
for
a
single
minute
i
seen
people
like
that
said
bill
with
a
nod
of
his
head
an
they
has
a
way
of
upsettin
the
happiest
folks
they
meet
look
out
suddenly
cried
the
mermaid
look
out
for
your
fingers
here
are
the
snapping
eels
who
where
asked
trot
anxiously
and
now
they
were
in
the
midst
of
a
cluster
of
wriggling
darting
eels
which
sported
all
around
them
in
the
water
with
marvelous
activity
yes
look
out
for
your
fingers
and
your
noses
said
one
of
the
eels
making
a
dash
for
bill
at
first
the
sailor
was
tempted
to
put
out
a
hand
and
push
the
creature
away
but
remembering
that
his
fingers
would
thus
be
exposed
he
remained
quiet
and
the
eel
snapped
harmlessly
just
before
his
face
and
then
darted
away
stop
it
said
merla
stop
it
this
minute
or
i
report
your
impudence
to
aquareine
oh
who
cares
shouted
the
eels
we
not
afraid
of
the
mermaids
she
stiffen
you
up
again
as
she
did
once
before
said
merla
if
you
try
to
hurt
the
earth
people
are
these
earth
people
asked
one
and
then
they
all
stopped
their
play
and
regarded
trot
and
bill
with
their
little
black
eyes
the
old
polliwog
looks
something
like
king
anko
said
one
of
them
i
not
a
polliwog
answered
bill
angrily
i
a
sailor
man
an
i
have
you
treat
me
decent
or
i
know
why
sailor
said
another
that
means
to
float
on
the
water
not
in
it
what
are
you
doing
down
here
i
jes
answered
bill
he
is
the
guest
of
our
queen
said
merla
and
so
is
this
little
girl
if
you
do
not
behave
nicely
to
them
you
will
surely
be
sorry
oh
that
all
right
replied
one
of
the
biggest
eels
wriggling
around
in
a
circle
and
then
snapping
at
a
companion
which
as
quickly
snapped
out
of
his
way
we
know
how
to
be
polite
to
company
as
well
as
the
mermaids
we
wo
hurt
them
come
on
fellows
let
go
scare
old
mummercubble
cried
another
and
then
in
a
flash
they
all
darted
away
and
left
our
friends
to
themselves
trot
was
greatly
relieved
i
do
like
eels
she
said
they
are
more
mischievous
than
harmful
replied
merla
but
i
do
not
care
much
for
them
myself
no
added
bill
they
ai
chapter
the
aristocratic
codfish
the
three
swam
slowly
along
quite
enjoying
the
cool
depths
of
the
water
every
little
while
they
met
with
some
strange
creature
or
one
that
seemed
strange
to
the
earth
people
for
although
trot
and
bill
had
seen
many
kinds
of
fish
after
they
had
been
caught
and
pulled
from
the
water
that
was
very
different
from
meeting
them
in
their
own
element
face
to
face
as
trot
expressed
it
now
that
the
various
fishes
were
swimming
around
free
and
unafraid
in
their
home
they
were
quite
different
from
the
gasping
excited
creatures
struggling
at
the
end
of
a
fishline
or
flopping
from
a
net
before
long
they
came
upon
a
group
of
large
fishes
lying
lazily
near
the
bottom
of
the
sea
they
were
a
dark
color
upon
their
backs
and
silver
underneath
but
not
especially
pretty
to
look
at
the
fishes
made
no
effort
to
get
out
of
merla
way
and
remained
motionless
except
for
the
gentle
motion
of
their
fins
and
gills
here
said
the
mermaid
pausing
is
the
most
aristocratic
family
of
fish
in
all
the
sea
what
are
they
asked
the
girl
codfish
was
the
reply
their
only
fault
is
that
they
are
too
haughty
and
foolishly
proud
of
their
pedigree
overhearing
this
speech
one
codfish
said
to
another
in
a
very
dignified
tone
of
voice
what
insolence
is
it
replied
the
other
there
ought
to
be
a
law
to
prevent
these
common
mermaids
from
discussing
their
superiors
my
sakes
said
trot
astonished
how
stuck
up
they
are
they
for
a
moment
the
group
of
fishes
stared
at
her
solemnly
then
one
of
the
remarked
in
a
disdainful
manner
come
my
dear
let
us
leave
these
vulgar
creatures
i
not
as
vulgar
as
you
are
exclaimed
trot
much
offended
by
this
speech
where
i
come
from
we
only
eat
codfish
when
nothing
else
in
the
house
to
eat
how
absurd
observed
one
of
the
creatures
arrogantly
eat
codfish
indeed
said
another
in
a
lofty
manner
yes
and
you
pretty
salty
too
i
can
tell
you
at
home
nothing
but
a
said
trot
dear
me
exclaimed
the
first
fish
who
had
spoken
must
we
stand
this
insulting
language
and
from
a
person
to
whom
we
have
never
been
introduced
i
do
need
no
interduction
replied
the
girl
i
eaten
you
and
you
always
make
me
thirsty
merla
laughed
merrily
at
this
and
the
codfish
said
with
much
dignity
come
fellow
aristocrats
let
us
go
never
mind
we
going
ourselves
announced
merla
and
followed
by
her
guests
the
pretty
mermaid
swam
away
i
heard
tell
of
codfish
aristocracy
said
bill
but
i
never
knowed
what
it
meant
afore
they
jus
made
me
mad
with
all
their
airs
observed
trot
so
i
gave
a
piece
of
my
mind
you
surely
did
mate
said
the
sailor
but
i
ai
sure
they
understand
what
they
like
when
they
salted
an
hung
up
in
the
pantry
folks
gets
they
do
know
theirselves
like
other
folks
knows
we
are
near
crabville
now
declared
merla
shall
we
visit
the
crabs
and
see
what
they
are
doing
yes
let
replied
trot
the
crabs
are
lots
of
fun
i
often
caught
them
among
the
rocks
on
the
shore
and
laughed
at
the
way
they
act
was
it
funny
at
dinnertime
to
see
the
way
they
slid
around
with
the
plates
those
were
not
crabs
but
lobsters
and
crawfish
remarked
the
mermaid
they
are
very
intelligent
creatures
and
by
making
them
serve
us
we
save
ourselves
much
household
work
of
course
they
are
awkward
and
provoke
us
sometimes
but
no
servants
are
perfect
it
is
said
so
we
get
along
with
ours
as
well
as
we
can
they
all
right
protested
the
child
even
if
they
did
tip
things
over
once
in
a
while
but
it
is
easy
to
work
in
a
sea
palace
i
sure
because
there
no
dusting
or
sweeping
to
be
done
or
scrubbin
added
bill
the
crabs
said
merla
are
second
cousins
to
the
lobsters
although
much
smaller
in
size
there
are
many
families
or
varieties
of
crabs
and
so
many
of
them
live
in
one
place
near
here
that
we
call
it
crabville
i
think
you
will
enjoy
seeing
these
little
creatures
in
their
native
haunts
they
now
approached
a
kelp
bed
the
straight
thin
stems
of
the
kelp
running
far
upward
to
the
surface
of
the
water
here
and
there
upon
the
stalks
were
leaves
but
trot
thought
the
growing
kelp
looked
much
like
sticks
of
macaroni
except
they
were
a
rich
color
it
was
beyond
the
kelp
which
they
had
to
push
aside
as
they
swam
through
so
thickly
did
it
grow
that
they
came
to
a
higher
level
a
sort
of
plateau
on
the
ocean
bottom
it
was
covered
with
scattered
rocks
of
all
sizes
which
appeared
to
have
broken
off
from
big
shelving
rocks
they
observed
nearby
the
place
they
entered
seemed
like
one
of
the
rocky
canyons
you
often
see
upon
the
earth
here
live
the
fiddler
crabs
said
merla
but
we
must
have
taken
them
by
surprise
it
is
so
quiet
even
as
she
spoke
there
was
a
stirring
and
scrambling
among
the
rocks
and
soon
scores
of
crabs
were
gathered
before
the
visitors
the
crabs
bore
fiddles
of
all
sorts
and
shapes
in
their
claws
and
one
big
fellow
carried
a
leader
baton
the
latter
crab
climbed
upon
a
flat
rock
and
in
an
excited
voice
called
out
ready
now
ready
good
fiddlers
we
play
number
hail
to
the
mermaids
ready
take
aim
fire
away
at
this
command
every
crab
began
scraping
at
his
fiddle
as
hard
as
he
could
and
the
sounds
were
so
shrill
and
unmusical
that
trot
wondered
when
they
would
begin
to
play
a
tune
but
they
never
did
it
was
one
regular
of
sounds
from
beginning
to
end
when
the
noise
finally
stopped
the
leader
turned
to
his
visitors
and
waving
his
baton
toward
them
asked
well
what
did
you
think
of
that
not
much
said
trot
honestly
what
it
all
about
i
composed
it
myself
said
the
fiddler
crab
but
it
highly
classical
i
admit
all
really
great
music
is
an
acquired
taste
i
do
like
it
remarked
bill
it
might
do
all
right
to
stir
up
a
racket
new
year
eve
but
to
call
that
music
just
then
the
crabs
started
fiddling
again
harder
than
ever
and
as
it
promised
to
be
a
long
performance
they
left
the
little
creatures
scraping
away
at
their
fiddles
as
if
for
dear
life
and
swam
along
the
rocky
canyon
until
on
turning
a
corner
they
came
upon
a
new
and
different
scene
there
were
crabs
here
too
many
of
them
and
they
were
performing
the
queerest
antics
imaginable
some
were
building
themselves
into
a
pyramid
each
standing
on
edge
with
the
biggest
and
strongest
ones
at
the
bottom
when
the
crabs
were
five
or
six
rows
high
they
would
all
tumble
over
still
clinging
to
one
another
and
having
reached
the
ground
they
would
separate
and
commence
to
build
the
pyramid
over
again
others
were
chasing
one
another
around
in
a
circle
always
moving
backward
or
sidewise
and
trying
to
play
leapfrog
as
they
went
still
others
were
swinging
on
slight
branches
of
seaweed
or
turning
cartwheels
or
indulging
in
similar
antics
merla
and
the
earth
people
watched
the
busy
little
creatures
for
some
time
before
they
were
themselves
observed
but
finally
trot
gave
a
laugh
when
one
crab
fell
on
its
back
and
began
frantically
waving
its
legs
to
get
again
at
the
sound
of
her
laughter
they
all
stopped
their
play
and
came
toward
the
visitors
in
a
flock
looking
up
at
them
with
their
bright
eyes
in
a
most
comical
way
welcome
home
cried
one
as
he
turned
a
back
somersault
and
knocked
another
crab
over
what
the
difference
between
a
mermaid
and
a
tadpole
asked
another
in
a
loud
voice
and
without
a
pause
continued
why
one
drops
its
tail
and
the
other
holds
onto
it
ha
ha
ho
ho
hee
hee
these
said
merla
are
the
clown
crabs
they
are
very
silly
things
as
you
may
already
have
discovered
but
for
a
short
time
they
are
rather
amusing
one
tires
of
them
very
soon
they
funny
said
trot
laughing
again
it
almost
as
good
as
a
circus
i
do
think
they
would
make
me
tired
but
then
i
not
a
mermaid
the
clown
crabs
had
now
formed
a
row
in
front
of
them
johnsing
asked
one
why
is
a
mermaid
like
an
automobile
i
do
know
tommy
blimken
answered
a
big
crab
in
the
middle
of
the
row
why
do
you
think
a
mermaid
is
like
an
automobile
because
they
both
get
tired
said
tommy
blimken
then
all
the
crabs
laughed
and
tommy
seemed
to
laugh
louder
than
the
rest
how
do
the
crabs
in
the
sea
know
anything
automobiles
asked
trot
why
tommy
blimken
and
harry
hustle
were
both
captured
once
by
humans
and
put
in
an
aquarium
answered
the
mermaid
but
one
day
they
climbed
out
and
escaped
finally
making
their
way
back
to
the
sea
and
home
again
so
they
are
quite
traveled
you
see
and
great
favorites
among
the
crabs
while
they
were
on
land
they
saw
a
great
many
curious
things
and
so
i
suppose
they
saw
automobiles
we
did
we
did
cried
harry
hustle
an
awkward
crab
with
one
big
claw
and
one
little
one
and
we
saw
earth
people
with
legs
awfully
funny
they
were
and
animals
called
horses
with
legs
and
other
creatures
with
legs
and
the
people
cover
themselves
with
the
queerest
things
they
even
wear
feathers
and
flowers
on
their
heads
and
oh
we
know
all
about
that
said
trot
we
live
on
the
earth
ourselves
well
you
lucky
to
get
off
from
it
and
into
the
good
water
said
the
crab
i
nearly
died
on
the
earth
it
was
so
stupid
dry
and
airy
but
the
circus
was
great
they
held
the
performance
right
in
front
of
the
aquarium
where
we
lived
and
tommy
and
i
learned
all
the
tricks
of
the
tumblers
hi
come
on
fellows
and
show
the
earth
people
what
you
can
do
at
this
the
crabs
began
performing
their
antics
again
but
they
did
the
same
things
over
and
over
so
bill
and
trot
soon
tired
as
merla
said
they
would
and
decided
they
had
seen
enough
of
the
crab
circus
so
they
proceeded
to
swim
farther
up
the
rocky
canyon
and
near
its
upper
end
they
came
to
a
lot
of
conch
shells
lying
upon
the
sandy
bottom
a
crab
was
sticking
his
head
out
from
each
of
these
shells
these
are
the
hermit
crabs
said
one
of
the
mermaids
they
steal
these
shells
and
live
in
them
so
no
enemies
can
attack
them
do
they
get
lonesome
asked
trot
perhaps
so
my
dear
but
they
do
not
seem
to
mind
being
lonesome
they
are
great
cowards
and
think
if
they
can
but
protect
their
lives
there
is
nothing
else
to
care
for
unlike
the
jolly
crabs
we
have
just
left
the
hermits
are
cross
and
unsociable
oh
keep
quiet
and
go
away
said
one
of
the
hermit
crabs
in
a
grumpy
voice
no
one
wants
mermaids
around
here
then
every
crab
withdrew
its
head
into
its
shell
and
our
friends
saw
them
no
more
they
not
very
polite
observed
trot
following
the
mermaid
as
merla
swam
upward
into
the
middle
water
i
know
now
why
cross
people
are
called
said
bill
they
got
dispositions
jes
like
these
hermit
crabs
presently
they
came
upon
a
small
flock
of
mackerel
and
noticed
that
the
fishes
seemed
much
excited
when
they
saw
the
mermaid
they
cried
out
oh
merla
what
do
you
think
our
flippity
has
just
gone
to
glory
when
asked
the
mermaid
just
now
one
replied
we
were
lying
in
the
water
talking
quietly
together
when
a
spinning
shining
thing
came
along
and
our
dear
flippity
ate
it
then
he
went
shooting
up
to
the
top
of
the
water
and
gave
a
flop
and
went
to
glory
is
it
splendid
merla
poor
flippity
sighed
the
mermaid
i
sorry
for
he
was
the
prettiest
and
nicest
mackerel
in
your
whole
flock
what
does
it
mean
asked
trot
how
did
flippity
go
to
glory
why
he
was
caught
by
a
hook
and
pulled
out
of
the
water
into
some
boat
merla
explained
but
these
poor
stupid
creatures
do
not
understand
that
and
when
one
of
them
is
jerked
out
of
the
water
and
disappears
they
have
the
idea
he
has
gone
to
glory
which
means
to
them
some
unknown
but
beautiful
sea
i
often
wondered
said
trot
why
fishes
are
foolish
enough
to
bite
on
hooks
they
must
know
enough
to
know
they
hooks
added
bill
musingly
oh
they
do
replied
merla
i
seen
fishes
gather
around
a
hook
and
look
at
it
carefully
for
a
long
time
they
all
know
it
is
a
hook
and
that
if
they
bite
the
bait
upon
it
they
will
be
pulled
out
of
the
water
but
they
are
curious
to
know
what
will
happen
to
them
afterward
and
think
it
means
happiness
instead
of
death
so
finally
one
takes
the
hook
and
disappears
and
the
others
never
know
what
becomes
of
him
why
do
you
tell
the
truth
asked
trot
oh
we
do
the
mermaids
have
warned
them
many
times
but
it
does
no
good
at
all
the
fish
are
stupid
creatures
but
i
wish
i
was
flippity
said
one
of
the
mackerel
staring
at
trot
with
his
big
round
eyes
he
went
to
glory
before
i
could
eat
the
hook
myself
you
lucky
answered
the
child
flippity
will
be
fried
in
a
pan
for
someone
dinner
you
would
like
that
would
you
flippity
has
gone
to
glory
said
another
and
then
they
swam
away
in
haste
to
tell
the
news
to
all
they
met
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
foolish
remarked
trot
as
she
swam
slowly
on
through
the
clear
blue
water
yes
it
is
very
foolish
and
very
sad
answered
merla
but
if
the
fish
were
wise
men
could
not
catch
them
for
food
and
many
poor
people
on
your
earth
make
their
living
by
fishing
it
seems
wicked
to
catch
such
pretty
things
said
the
child
i
do
not
think
so
merla
replied
laughingly
for
they
were
born
to
become
food
for
someone
and
men
are
not
the
only
ones
that
eat
fishes
many
creatures
of
the
sea
feed
upon
them
they
even
eat
one
another
at
times
and
if
none
was
ever
destroyed
they
would
soon
become
so
numerous
that
they
would
clog
the
waters
of
the
ocean
and
leave
no
room
for
the
rest
of
us
so
after
all
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
they
are
thoughtless
and
foolish
presently
they
came
to
some
round
balls
that
looked
much
like
balloons
in
shape
and
were
gaily
colored
they
floated
quietly
in
the
water
and
trot
inquired
what
they
were
balloonfish
answered
merla
they
are
helpless
creatures
but
have
little
spikes
all
over
them
so
their
enemies
dare
not
bite
them
for
fear
of
getting
pricked
trot
found
the
balloonfish
quite
interesting
they
had
little
dots
of
eyes
and
dots
for
mouths
but
she
could
see
no
noses
and
their
fins
and
tails
were
very
small
they
catch
these
fish
in
the
south
sea
islands
and
make
lanterns
of
said
bill
they
first
skin
and
sew
the
skin
up
again
to
let
it
dry
and
then
they
put
candles
inside
and
the
light
shines
through
the
dried
skin
many
other
curious
sights
they
saw
in
the
ocean
that
afternoon
and
both
bill
and
trot
thoroughly
enjoyed
their
glimpse
of
sea
life
at
last
merla
said
it
was
time
to
return
to
the
palace
from
which
she
claimed
they
had
not
at
any
time
been
very
far
distant
we
must
prepare
for
dinner
as
it
will
soon
begin
to
grow
dark
in
the
water
continued
their
conductor
so
they
swam
leisurely
back
to
the
groves
that
surrounded
the
palaces
and
as
they
entered
the
gardens
the
sun
sank
and
deep
shadows
began
to
form
in
the
ocean
depths
chapter
a
banquet
under
water
the
palaces
of
the
mermaids
were
all
aglow
with
lights
as
they
approached
them
and
trot
was
amazed
at
the
sight
where
do
the
lamps
come
from
she
asked
their
guide
wonderingly
they
are
not
lamps
my
dear
replied
merla
much
amused
at
this
suggestion
we
use
electric
lights
in
our
palaces
and
have
done
so
for
thousands
of
years
long
before
the
earth
people
knew
of
electric
lights
but
where
do
you
get
inquired
bill
who
was
as
much
astonished
as
the
girl
from
a
transparent
jellyfish
which
naturally
emits
a
strong
and
beautiful
electric
light
was
the
answer
we
have
many
hundreds
of
them
in
our
palaces
as
you
will
presently
see
their
way
was
now
lighted
by
small
phosphorescent
creatures
scattered
about
the
sea
gardens
and
which
merla
informed
them
were
hyalaea
or
sea
glowworms
but
their
light
was
dim
when
compared
to
that
of
the
electric
jellyfish
which
they
found
placed
in
clusters
upon
the
ceilings
of
all
the
rooms
of
the
palaces
rendering
them
light
as
day
trot
watched
these
curious
creatures
with
delight
for
delicately
colored
lights
ran
around
their
bodies
in
every
direction
in
a
continuous
stream
shedding
splendid
rays
throughout
the
vast
halls
a
group
of
mermaids
met
the
visitors
in
the
hall
of
the
main
palace
and
told
merla
the
queen
had
instructed
them
to
show
the
guests
to
their
rooms
as
soon
as
they
arrived
so
trot
followed
two
of
them
through
several
passages
after
which
they
swam
upward
and
entered
a
circular
opening
there
were
no
stairs
here
because
there
was
no
need
of
them
and
the
little
girl
soon
found
herself
in
an
upper
room
that
was
very
beautiful
indeed
all
the
walls
were
covered
with
iridescent
shells
polished
till
they
resembled
and
upon
the
glass
ceiling
were
clusters
of
the
brilliant
electric
jellyfish
rendering
the
room
bright
and
cheerful
with
their
radiance
in
one
corner
stood
a
couch
of
white
coral
with
gossamer
draperies
hanging
around
it
from
the
four
high
posts
upon
examining
it
the
child
found
the
couch
was
covered
with
soft
amber
sponges
which
rendered
it
very
comfortable
to
lie
upon
in
a
wardrobe
she
found
several
beautiful
gossamer
gowns
richly
embroidered
in
colored
seaweeds
and
these
mayre
was
told
she
might
wear
while
she
remained
the
guest
of
the
mermaids
she
also
found
a
toilet
table
with
brushes
combs
and
other
conveniences
all
of
which
were
made
of
polished
really
the
room
was
more
dainty
and
comfortable
than
one
might
suppose
possible
in
a
palace
far
beneath
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
trot
was
greatly
delighted
with
her
new
quarters
the
mermaid
attendants
assisted
the
child
to
dress
herself
in
one
of
the
prettiest
robes
which
she
found
to
be
quite
dry
and
fitted
her
comfortably
then
the
brushed
and
dressed
her
hair
and
tied
it
with
ribbons
of
seaweed
finally
they
placed
around
her
neck
a
string
of
pearls
that
would
have
been
priceless
upon
the
earth
and
now
the
little
girl
announced
she
was
ready
for
supper
and
had
a
good
appetite
bill
had
been
given
a
similar
room
near
trot
but
the
old
sailor
refused
to
change
his
clothes
for
any
others
offered
him
for
which
reason
he
was
ready
for
supper
long
before
his
comrade
what
bothers
me
mate
he
said
to
the
little
girl
as
the
y
swam
toward
the
great
banquet
hall
where
queen
aquareine
awaited
them
is
why
ai
we
crushed
by
the
pressin
of
the
water
agin
us
bein
as
we
down
here
in
the
deep
sea
how
that
why
should
we
be
crushed
she
asked
why
knows
that
the
deeper
you
go
in
the
sea
the
more
the
water
presses
agin
you
he
explained
even
the
divers
in
their
steel
jackets
ca
stand
it
very
deep
down
an
here
we
be
miles
from
the
top
o
the
water
i
an
we
do
feel
crowded
a
bit
i
know
why
answered
the
child
wisely
the
water
do
touch
us
you
see
if
it
did
it
might
crush
us
but
it
do
it
always
held
a
little
way
off
from
our
bodies
by
the
magic
of
the
fairy
mermaids
true
enough
trot
declared
the
sailor
man
what
an
idjut
i
was
not
to
think
o
that
myself
in
the
royal
banquet
hall
were
assembled
many
of
the
mermaids
headed
by
the
lovely
queen
and
as
soon
as
their
earth
guests
arrived
aquareine
ordered
the
meal
to
be
served
the
lobsters
again
waited
upon
the
table
wearing
little
white
caps
and
aprons
which
made
them
look
very
funny
but
trot
was
so
hungry
after
her
afternoon
excursion
that
she
did
not
pay
as
much
attention
to
the
lobsters
as
she
did
to
her
supper
which
was
very
delicious
and
consisted
of
many
courses
a
lobster
spilled
some
soup
on
bill
bald
head
and
made
him
yell
for
a
minute
because
it
was
hot
and
he
had
not
expected
it
but
the
queen
apologized
very
sweetly
for
the
awkwardness
of
her
servants
and
the
sailor
soon
forgot
all
about
the
incident
in
his
enjoyment
of
the
meal
after
the
feast
ended
they
all
went
to
the
big
reception
room
where
some
of
the
mermaids
played
upon
harps
while
others
sang
pretty
songs
they
danced
together
too
a
graceful
swimming
dance
so
queer
to
the
little
girl
that
it
interested
and
amused
her
greatly
bill
seemed
a
bit
bashful
among
so
many
beautiful
mermaids
yet
he
was
pleased
when
the
queen
offered
him
a
place
beside
her
throne
where
he
could
see
and
hear
all
the
delightful
entertainment
provided
for
the
royal
guests
he
did
not
talk
much
being
a
man
of
few
words
except
when
alone
with
trot
but
his
eyes
were
big
and
round
with
wonder
at
the
sights
he
saw
trot
and
the
sailor
man
went
to
bed
early
and
slept
soundly
upon
their
couches
the
little
girl
never
wakened
until
long
after
the
sun
was
shining
down
through
the
glass
roof
of
her
room
and
when
she
opened
her
eyes
she
was
startled
to
find
a
number
of
big
small
and
fishes
staring
at
her
through
the
glass
that
one
bad
thing
this
mermaid
palace
she
said
to
herself
it
too
public
in
the
sea
can
look
at
you
through
the
glass
as
much
as
it
likes
i
would
mind
fishes
looking
at
me
if
they
had
such
big
eyes
an
goodness
me
there
a
monster
that
all
head
and
there
goes
a
fish
with
a
sail
on
its
back
an
here
old
mummercubble
i
sure
for
he
got
a
head
just
like
a
pig
she
might
have
watched
the
fishes
on
the
roof
for
hours
had
she
not
remembered
it
was
late
and
breakfast
must
be
ready
so
she
dressed
and
made
her
toilet
and
swam
down
into
the
palace
to
find
bill
and
the
mermaids
politely
waiting
for
her
to
join
them
the
sea
maidens
were
as
fresh
and
lovely
as
ever
while
each
and
all
proved
sweet
tempered
and
merry
even
at
the
breakfast
table
and
that
is
where
people
are
cross
if
they
ever
are
during
the
meal
the
queen
said
i
shall
take
you
this
morning
to
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
ocean
where
the
largest
and
most
remarkable
sea
creatures
live
and
we
must
visit
king
anko
too
for
the
sea
serpent
would
feel
hurt
and
slighted
if
i
did
not
bring
my
guests
to
call
upon
him
that
will
be
nice
said
trot
eagerly
but
bill
asked
is
there
any
danger
i
think
not
replied
queen
aquareine
i
can
not
say
that
you
will
be
exposed
to
any
danger
at
all
so
long
as
i
with
you
but
we
are
going
into
the
neighborhood
of
such
fierce
and
even
terrible
beings
which
would
attack
you
at
once
did
they
suspect
you
to
be
earth
people
so
in
order
to
guard
your
safety
i
intend
to
draw
the
magic
circle
around
both
of
you
before
we
start
what
is
the
magic
circle
asked
trot
a
fairy
charm
that
prevents
any
enemy
from
touching
you
no
monster
of
the
sea
however
powerful
will
be
able
to
reach
your
body
while
you
are
protected
by
the
magic
circle
declared
the
queen
oh
then
i
not
be
a
bit
afraid
returned
the
child
with
perfect
confidence
am
i
to
have
the
magic
circle
drawn
around
me
too
asked
bill
of
course
answered
aquareine
you
will
need
no
other
protection
than
that
yet
both
princess
clia
and
i
will
both
be
with
you
for
today
i
shall
leave
merla
to
rule
our
palaces
in
my
place
until
we
return
no
sooner
was
breakfast
finished
than
trot
was
anxious
to
start
the
girl
was
also
curious
to
discover
what
the
powerful
magic
circle
might
prove
to
be
but
she
was
a
little
disappointed
in
the
ceremony
the
queen
merely
grasped
her
fairy
wand
in
her
right
hand
and
swam
around
the
child
in
a
circle
from
left
to
right
then
she
took
her
wand
in
her
left
hand
and
swam
around
trot
in
another
circle
from
right
to
left
now
my
dear
said
she
you
are
safe
from
any
creature
we
are
liable
to
meet
she
performed
the
same
ceremony
for
bill
who
was
doubtful
about
the
magic
circle
because
he
felt
the
same
after
it
as
he
had
before
but
he
said
nothing
of
his
unbelief
and
soon
they
left
the
palace
and
started
upon
their
journey
chapter
the
bashful
octopus
it
was
a
lovely
day
and
the
sea
was
like
azure
under
the
rays
of
the
sun
over
the
flower
beds
and
through
the
gardens
they
swam
emerging
into
the
open
sea
in
a
direction
opposite
that
taken
by
the
visitors
the
day
before
the
party
consisted
of
but
four
queen
aquareine
princess
clia
trot
and
bill
people
who
live
upon
the
land
know
only
those
sea
creatures
which
they
are
able
to
catch
in
nets
or
upon
hooks
or
those
which
become
disabled
and
are
washed
ashore
remarked
the
queen
as
they
swam
swiftly
through
the
clear
water
and
those
who
sail
in
ships
see
only
the
creatures
who
chance
to
come
to
the
surface
but
in
the
deep
ocean
caverns
are
queer
beings
that
no
mortal
has
ever
heard
of
or
beheld
and
some
of
these
we
are
to
visit
we
shall
also
see
some
sea
shrubs
and
flowering
weeds
which
are
sure
to
delight
you
with
their
beauty
the
sights
really
began
before
they
had
gone
very
far
from
the
palace
and
a
school
of
butterfly
fish
having
gorgeous
colors
spattered
over
their
broad
wings
was
first
to
delight
the
strangers
they
swam
just
as
butterflies
fly
with
a
darting
jerky
motion
and
called
a
merry
good
morning
to
the
mermaids
as
they
passed
these
butterfly
fish
are
remarkably
active
said
the
princess
and
their
quick
motions
protect
them
from
their
enemies
we
like
to
meet
them
they
are
always
so
gay
and
why
so
am
i
cried
a
sharp
voice
just
beside
them
and
they
all
paused
to
discover
what
creature
had
spoken
to
them
take
care
said
clia
in
a
low
voice
it
an
octopus
trot
looked
eagerly
around
a
long
brown
arm
stretched
across
their
way
in
front
and
another
just
behind
them
but
that
did
not
worry
her
the
octopus
himself
came
slowly
sliding
up
to
them
and
proved
to
be
well
worth
looking
at
he
wore
a
red
coat
with
brass
buttons
and
a
silk
hat
was
tipped
over
one
ear
his
eyes
were
somewhat
dull
and
watery
and
he
had
a
moustache
of
long
feelers
that
curled
stiffly
at
the
ends
when
he
tried
to
smile
at
them
he
showed
two
rows
of
sharp
white
teeth
in
spite
of
his
red
coat
and
vest
his
standing
collar
and
carefully
tied
cravat
the
legs
of
the
octopus
were
bare
and
trot
noticed
he
used
some
of
his
legs
for
arms
as
in
one
of
them
was
held
a
slender
cane
and
in
another
a
handkerchief
well
well
said
the
octopus
are
you
all
dumb
or
do
you
know
enough
to
be
civil
when
you
meet
a
neighbor
we
know
how
to
be
civil
to
our
friends
replied
trot
who
did
not
like
the
way
he
spoke
well
are
we
not
friends
then
asked
the
octopus
in
an
airy
tone
of
voice
i
think
not
said
the
little
girl
octopuses
are
horrid
creatures
octopi
if
you
please
octopi
said
the
monster
with
a
laugh
i
do
see
any
pie
that
pleases
me
replied
trot
beginning
to
get
angry
octopus
means
one
of
us
two
or
more
are
called
octopi
remarked
the
creature
as
if
correcting
her
speech
i
suppose
a
lot
of
you
would
be
a
whole
bakery
she
said
scornfully
our
name
is
latin
it
was
given
to
us
by
learned
scientists
years
ago
said
the
octopus
that
true
enough
agreed
bill
the
learned
scientists
named
blamed
thing
they
come
across
an
they
picked
out
names
as
nobody
could
understand
or
pernounce
that
is
our
fault
sir
said
the
octopus
indeed
it
pretty
hard
for
us
to
go
through
life
with
such
terrible
names
think
of
the
poor
little
seahorse
he
used
to
be
a
merry
and
cheerful
fellow
but
since
they
named
him
he
has
smiled
once
let
go
said
trot
i
do
like
to
with
octopuses
octopi
said
the
creature
again
correcting
her
you
jus
as
horrid
whether
you
puses
or
pies
she
declared
horrid
cried
the
monster
in
a
shocked
tone
of
voice
not
only
horrid
but
horrible
persisted
the
girl
may
i
ask
in
what
way
he
inquired
and
it
was
easy
to
see
he
was
offended
why
knows
that
octopuses
are
jus
wicked
an
deceitful
she
said
up
on
the
earth
where
i
live
we
call
the
stannerd
oil
company
an
octopus
an
the
coal
trust
an
octopus
an
stop
stop
cried
the
monster
in
a
pleading
voice
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
the
earth
people
whom
i
have
always
respected
compare
me
to
the
stannerd
oil
company
yes
said
trot
positively
oh
what
a
disgrace
what
a
cruel
direful
dreadful
disgrace
moaned
the
octopus
drooping
his
head
in
shame
and
trot
could
see
great
tears
falling
down
his
cheeks
this
comes
of
having
a
bad
name
said
the
queen
gently
for
she
was
moved
by
the
monster
grief
it
is
unjust
it
is
cruel
and
unjust
sobbed
the
creature
mournfully
just
because
we
have
several
long
arms
and
take
whatever
we
can
reach
they
accuse
us
of
being
like
like
oh
i
can
not
say
it
it
is
too
shameful
too
humiliating
come
let
go
said
trot
again
so
they
left
the
poor
octopus
weeping
and
wiping
his
watery
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
and
swam
on
their
way
i
not
a
bit
sorry
for
him
remarked
the
child
for
his
legs
remind
me
of
serpents
so
they
do
me
agreed
bill
but
the
octopi
are
not
very
bad
said
the
princess
and
we
get
along
with
them
much
better
than
we
do
with
their
cousins
the
sea
devils
oh
are
the
sea
devils
their
cousins
asked
trot
yes
and
they
are
the
only
creatures
of
the
ocean
which
we
greatly
fear
replied
aquareine
i
hope
we
shall
meet
none
today
for
we
are
going
near
to
the
dismal
caverns
where
they
live
what
are
the
sea
devils
like
inquired
bill
a
little
uneasily
something
like
the
octopus
you
just
saw
only
much
larger
and
of
a
bright
scarlet
color
striped
with
black
answered
the
queen
they
are
very
fierce
and
terrible
creatures
and
nearly
as
much
dreaded
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
ocean
as
is
zog
and
nearly
as
powerful
as
king
anko
himself
zog
who
is
zog
questioned
the
girl
i
have
heard
of
him
before
now
we
do
not
like
to
mention
zog
name
responded
the
queen
in
a
low
voice
he
is
the
wicked
genius
of
the
sea
and
a
magician
of
great
power
what
he
like
asked
bill
he
is
a
dreadful
creature
part
fish
part
man
part
beast
and
part
serpent
centuries
ago
they
cast
him
off
the
earth
into
the
sea
where
he
has
caused
much
trouble
once
he
waged
a
terrible
war
against
king
anko
but
the
sea
serpent
finally
conquered
zog
and
drove
the
magician
into
his
castle
where
he
now
stays
shut
up
for
if
ever
anko
catches
the
monster
outside
of
his
enchanted
castle
he
will
kill
him
and
zog
knows
that
very
well
seems
like
you
have
your
troubles
down
here
just
as
we
do
on
top
the
ground
remarked
bill
but
i
glad
old
zog
is
shut
up
in
his
castle
added
trot
is
it
a
sea
castle
like
your
own
palace
i
can
not
say
my
dear
for
the
enchantment
makes
it
invisible
to
all
eyes
but
those
of
its
inhabitants
replied
aquareine
no
one
sees
zog
now
and
we
scarcely
ever
hear
of
him
but
all
the
sea
people
know
he
is
here
someplace
and
fear
his
power
even
in
the
old
days
before
anko
conquered
him
zog
was
the
enemy
of
the
mermaids
as
he
was
of
all
the
good
and
respectable
seafolk
but
do
not
worry
about
the
magician
i
beg
of
you
for
he
has
not
dared
to
do
an
evil
deed
in
many
many
years
oh
i
not
afraid
asserted
trot
i
glad
of
that
said
the
queen
keep
together
friends
and
be
careful
not
to
separate
for
here
comes
an
army
of
sawfishes
even
as
aquareine
spoke
they
saw
a
swirl
and
commotion
in
the
water
ahead
of
them
while
a
sound
like
a
muffled
roar
fell
upon
their
ears
then
swiftly
there
dashed
upon
them
a
group
of
great
fishes
with
long
saws
sticking
out
in
front
of
their
noses
armed
with
sharp
hooked
teeth
all
set
in
a
row
they
were
larger
than
the
swordfishes
and
seemed
more
fierce
and
bold
but
the
mermaids
and
trot
and
bill
quietly
awaited
their
attack
and
instead
of
tearing
them
with
their
saws
as
they
expected
to
do
the
fishes
were
unable
to
touch
them
at
all
they
tried
every
possible
way
to
get
at
their
proposed
victims
but
the
magic
circle
was
all
powerful
and
turned
aside
the
ugly
saws
so
our
friends
were
not
disturbed
at
all
seeing
this
the
sawfishes
soon
abandoned
the
attempt
and
with
growls
and
roars
of
disappointment
swam
away
and
were
quickly
out
of
sight
trot
had
been
a
wee
bit
frightened
during
the
attack
but
now
she
laughed
gleefully
and
told
the
queen
that
it
seemed
very
nice
to
be
protected
by
fairy
powers
the
water
grew
a
darker
blue
as
they
descended
into
its
depths
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
trot
was
surprised
to
find
she
could
see
so
plainly
through
the
high
wall
of
water
above
her
but
the
sun
was
able
to
shoot
its
beams
straight
down
through
the
transparent
sea
and
they
seemed
to
penetrate
to
every
nook
and
crevice
of
the
rocky
bottom
in
this
deeper
part
of
the
ocean
some
of
the
fishes
had
a
phosphorescent
light
of
their
own
and
these
could
be
seen
far
ahead
as
if
they
were
lanterns
the
explorers
met
a
school
of
argonauts
going
up
to
the
surface
for
a
sail
and
the
child
watched
these
strange
creatures
with
much
curiosity
the
argonauts
live
in
shells
in
which
they
are
able
to
hide
in
case
of
danger
from
prowling
wolf
fishes
but
otherwise
they
crawl
out
and
carry
their
shells
like
humps
upon
their
backs
then
they
spread
their
skinny
sails
above
them
and
sail
away
under
water
till
they
come
to
the
surface
where
they
float
and
let
the
currents
of
air
carry
them
along
the
same
as
the
currents
of
water
had
done
before
trot
thought
the
argonauts
comical
little
creatures
with
their
big
eyes
and
sharp
noses
and
to
her
they
looked
like
a
fleet
of
tiny
ships
it
is
said
that
men
got
their
first
idea
of
boats
and
of
how
to
sail
them
from
watching
these
little
argonauts
chapter
the
undiscovered
island
in
following
the
fleet
of
argonauts
the
four
explorers
had
risen
higher
in
the
water
and
soon
found
they
had
wandered
to
an
open
space
that
seemed
to
trot
like
the
flat
top
of
a
high
hill
the
sands
were
covered
with
a
growth
of
weeds
so
gorgeously
colored
that
one
who
had
never
peered
beneath
the
surface
of
the
sea
would
scarcely
believe
they
were
not
the
product
of
a
dye
shop
every
known
hue
seemed
represented
in
the
delicate
leaves
that
swayed
softly
to
and
fro
as
the
current
moved
them
they
were
not
set
close
together
these
branches
of
magnificent
hues
but
were
scattered
sparsely
over
the
sandy
bottom
of
the
sea
so
that
while
from
a
distance
they
seemed
thick
a
nearer
view
found
them
spread
out
with
ample
spaces
of
sand
between
them
in
these
sandy
spaces
lay
the
real
attractiveness
of
the
place
for
here
were
many
of
those
wonders
of
the
deep
that
have
surprised
and
interested
people
in
all
ages
first
were
the
starfishes
hundreds
of
them
it
seemed
lying
sleepily
on
the
bottom
with
their
five
or
six
points
extended
outward
they
were
of
various
colors
some
rich
and
brilliant
others
of
dark
brown
hues
a
few
had
wound
their
arms
around
the
weeds
or
were
creeping
slowly
from
one
place
to
another
in
the
latter
case
turning
their
points
downward
and
using
them
as
legs
but
most
of
them
were
lying
motionless
and
as
trot
looked
down
upon
them
she
thought
they
resembled
stars
in
the
sky
on
a
bright
night
except
that
the
blue
of
the
heavens
was
here
replaced
by
the
white
sand
and
the
twinkling
diamond
stars
by
the
colored
starfish
we
are
near
an
island
said
the
queen
and
that
is
why
so
many
starfishes
are
here
as
they
love
to
keep
close
to
shore
also
the
little
seahorses
love
these
weeds
and
to
me
they
are
more
interesting
than
the
starfish
trot
now
noticed
the
seahorses
for
the
first
time
they
were
quite
small
merely
two
or
three
inches
high
but
had
funny
little
heads
that
were
shaped
much
like
the
head
of
a
horse
and
bright
intelligent
eyes
they
had
no
legs
though
for
their
bodies
ended
in
tails
which
they
twined
around
the
stems
of
seaweeds
to
support
themselves
and
keep
the
currents
from
carrying
them
away
trot
bent
down
close
to
examine
one
of
the
queer
little
creatures
and
exclaimed
why
the
seahorses
have
any
fins
or
anything
to
swim
with
oh
yes
we
have
replied
the
sea
horse
in
a
tiny
but
distinct
voice
these
things
on
the
side
of
my
head
are
fins
i
thought
they
were
ears
said
the
girl
so
they
are
fins
and
ears
at
the
same
time
answered
the
little
sea
animal
also
there
are
small
fins
on
our
backs
of
course
we
ca
swim
as
the
mermaids
do
or
even
as
swiftly
as
fishes
but
we
manage
to
get
around
thank
you
do
the
fishes
catch
and
eat
you
inquired
trot
curiously
sometimes
admitted
the
sea
horse
and
there
are
many
other
living
things
that
have
a
way
of
destroying
us
but
here
i
am
as
you
see
over
six
weeks
old
and
during
that
time
i
have
escaped
every
danger
that
is
so
bad
is
it
phoo
said
a
starfish
lying
near
i
over
three
months
old
you
a
mere
baby
sea
horse
i
not
cried
the
sea
horse
excitedly
i
and
may
live
to
be
as
old
as
you
are
not
if
i
keep
on
living
said
the
starfish
calmly
and
trot
knew
he
was
correct
in
his
statement
the
little
girl
now
noticed
several
sea
spiders
creeping
around
and
drew
back
because
she
did
not
think
them
very
pretty
they
were
shaped
not
unlike
the
starfishes
but
had
slender
legs
and
big
heads
with
eyes
sticking
out
of
them
oh
i
do
like
those
things
said
trot
coming
closer
to
her
companions
you
do
eh
said
a
big
sea
spider
in
a
cross
voice
why
do
you
come
around
here
then
scaring
away
my
dinner
when
you
not
wanted
it
is
your
ocean
replied
trot
no
and
it
is
yours
snapped
the
spider
but
as
it
big
enough
for
us
both
i
like
you
to
go
away
so
we
will
said
aquareine
gently
and
at
once
she
moved
toward
the
surface
of
the
water
trot
and
bill
followed
with
clia
and
the
child
asked
what
island
are
we
near
it
has
no
name
answered
the
queen
for
it
is
not
inhabited
by
man
nor
has
it
ever
yet
been
discovered
by
them
perhaps
you
will
be
the
first
humans
to
see
this
island
but
it
is
a
barren
rocky
place
and
only
fit
for
seals
and
turtles
are
any
of
them
there
now
bill
inquired
i
think
so
we
will
see
trot
was
astonished
to
find
how
near
they
were
to
the
top
of
the
ocean
for
they
had
not
ascended
through
the
water
very
long
when
suddenly
her
head
popped
into
the
air
and
she
gave
a
gasp
of
surprise
to
find
herself
looking
at
the
clear
sky
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
started
upon
this
adventure
by
rowing
into
cave
she
floated
comfortably
in
the
water
with
her
head
and
face
just
out
of
it
and
began
to
look
around
her
bill
was
at
her
side
and
so
were
the
two
mermaids
the
day
was
fair
and
the
surface
of
the
sea
which
stretched
far
away
as
the
eye
could
reach
rippled
under
a
gentle
breeze
they
had
risen
almost
at
the
edge
of
a
small
rocky
islet
high
in
the
middle
but
gradually
slanting
down
to
the
water
no
trees
or
bushes
or
grass
grew
anywhere
about
only
rocks
gray
and
bleak
were
to
be
seen
trot
scarcely
noticed
this
at
first
however
for
the
island
seemed
covered
with
groups
of
forms
some
still
and
some
moving
which
the
old
sailor
promptly
recognized
as
seals
many
were
lying
asleep
or
sunning
themselves
others
crept
awkwardly
around
using
their
strong
fins
as
legs
or
paddles
and
caring
little
if
they
disturbed
the
slumbers
of
the
others
once
in
a
while
one
of
those
crowded
out
of
place
would
give
a
loud
and
angry
bark
which
awakened
others
and
set
them
to
barking
likewise
baby
seals
were
there
in
great
numbers
and
were
more
active
and
playful
than
their
elders
it
was
really
wonderful
how
they
could
scramble
around
on
the
land
and
trot
laughed
more
than
once
at
their
antics
at
the
edge
of
the
water
lay
many
huge
turtles
some
as
big
around
as
a
wagon
wheel
and
others
much
smaller
in
size
the
big
ones
are
very
old
said
the
queen
seeing
trot
eyes
fixed
on
the
turtles
how
old
asked
the
child
hundreds
of
years
i
think
they
live
to
a
great
age
for
nothing
can
harm
them
when
they
withdraw
their
legs
and
heads
into
their
thick
shells
we
use
some
of
the
turtles
for
food
but
prefer
the
younger
ones
men
also
fish
for
turtles
and
eat
them
but
of
course
no
men
ever
come
to
this
place
in
the
ocean
so
the
inhabitants
of
this
little
island
know
they
are
perfectly
safe
in
the
center
of
the
island
rose
high
cliffs
on
top
of
which
were
to
be
seen
great
flocks
of
seagulls
some
whirling
in
the
air
while
others
were
perched
upon
the
points
of
rock
what
do
the
birds
find
to
eat
asked
bill
they
often
feed
upon
seals
which
die
of
accident
or
old
age
and
they
are
expert
fishermen
explained
queen
aquareine
curiously
enough
the
seals
also
feed
upon
these
birds
which
they
are
often
able
to
catch
in
their
strong
jaws
when
the
gulls
venture
too
near
and
then
the
seals
frequently
rob
the
nests
of
eggs
of
which
they
are
very
fond
i
like
a
few
gulls
eggs
now
remarked
a
big
seal
that
lay
near
them
upon
the
shore
trot
had
thought
him
sound
asleep
but
now
he
opened
his
eyes
to
blink
lazily
at
the
group
in
the
water
good
morning
said
the
queen
are
you
chief
muffruff
i
am
answered
the
old
seal
and
you
are
aquareine
the
mermaid
queen
you
see
i
remember
you
although
you
have
been
here
for
years
and
is
that
princess
clia
to
be
sure
but
the
other
mermaids
are
strangers
to
me
especially
the
one
i
not
a
mermaid
asserted
bill
i
a
sailor
the
mermaids
our
friends
are
earth
dwellers
explained
the
queen
that
odd
said
muffruff
i
ca
remember
that
any
earth
dwellers
ever
came
this
way
before
i
never
travel
far
you
see
for
i
chief
of
this
disorderly
family
of
seals
that
live
on
this
island
on
it
and
off
it
that
is
you
a
poor
chief
said
a
big
turtle
lying
beside
the
seal
if
your
people
are
disorderly
it
is
your
own
fault
muffruff
gave
a
chuckling
laugh
then
with
a
movement
quick
as
lightning
he
pushed
his
head
under
the
shell
of
the
turtle
and
gave
it
a
sudden
jerk
the
huge
turtle
was
tossed
up
on
edge
and
then
turned
flat
upon
its
back
where
its
short
legs
struggled
vainly
to
right
its
overturned
body
there
snorted
the
seal
contemptuously
perhaps
you
dare
insult
me
again
in
the
presence
of
visitors
you
old
seeing
the
plight
of
the
turtle
several
young
seals
came
laughingly
wabbling
to
the
spot
and
as
they
approached
the
helpless
creature
drew
in
his
legs
and
head
and
closed
his
two
shells
tightly
together
the
seals
bumped
against
the
turtle
and
gave
it
a
push
that
sent
it
sliding
down
the
beach
like
a
toboggan
and
a
minute
later
it
splashed
into
the
water
and
sank
out
of
sight
but
that
was
just
what
the
creature
wanted
on
shore
the
upset
turtle
was
quite
helpless
but
the
mischievous
seals
saved
him
for
as
soon
as
he
touched
the
water
he
was
able
to
turn
and
right
himself
which
he
promptly
did
then
he
raised
his
head
above
the
water
and
asked
is
it
peace
or
war
muffruff
whichever
you
like
answered
the
seal
indifferently
perhaps
the
turtle
was
angry
for
it
ran
on
shore
with
remarkable
swiftness
uttering
a
shrill
cry
as
it
advanced
at
once
all
the
other
turtles
awoke
to
life
and
with
upraised
heads
joined
their
comrade
in
the
rush
for
the
seals
most
of
chief
muffruff
band
scrambled
hastily
down
the
rocks
and
plunged
into
the
water
of
the
sea
without
waiting
for
the
turtles
to
reach
them
but
the
chief
himself
was
slow
in
escaping
it
may
be
that
he
was
ashamed
to
run
while
the
mermaids
were
watching
but
if
this
was
so
he
made
a
great
mistake
the
turtles
snapped
at
his
fins
and
tail
and
began
biting
round
chunks
out
of
them
so
that
chief
muffruff
screamed
with
pain
and
anger
and
floundered
into
the
water
as
fast
as
he
could
go
the
vengeful
turtles
were
certainly
the
victors
and
now
held
undisputed
possession
of
the
island
trot
laughed
joyously
at
the
incident
not
feeling
a
bit
sorry
for
the
old
seal
who
had
foolishly
begun
the
battle
even
the
gentle
queen
smiled
as
she
said
these
quarrels
between
the
turtles
and
the
seals
are
very
frequent
but
they
are
soon
ended
an
hour
from
now
they
will
all
be
lying
asleep
together
just
as
we
found
them
but
we
will
not
wait
for
that
let
us
go
she
sank
slowly
beneath
the
water
again
and
the
others
followed
after
her
chapter
zog
the
terrible
and
his
sea
devils
the
sun
must
be
going
under
a
cloud
said
trot
looking
ahead
they
had
descended
far
into
the
ocean
depths
again
further
the
girl
thought
than
they
had
ever
been
before
no
the
queen
answered
after
a
glance
ahead
of
them
that
is
a
cuttlefish
and
he
is
dyeing
the
sea
around
him
with
ink
so
that
he
can
hide
from
us
let
us
turn
a
little
to
the
left
for
we
could
see
nothing
at
all
in
that
inky
water
following
her
advice
they
made
a
broad
curve
to
the
left
and
at
once
the
water
began
to
darken
in
that
direction
why
there
another
of
said
bill
as
the
little
party
came
to
a
sudden
halt
so
there
is
returned
the
queen
and
trot
thought
there
was
a
little
quiver
of
anxiety
in
her
voice
we
must
go
far
to
the
right
to
escape
the
ink
so
they
again
started
this
time
almost
at
a
right
angle
to
their
former
course
the
little
girl
inquired
how
can
the
cuttlefish
color
the
water
so
very
black
they
carry
big
sacks
in
front
of
them
where
they
conceal
the
ink
princess
clia
answered
whenever
they
choose
the
cuttlefish
are
able
to
press
out
this
ink
and
it
colors
the
water
for
a
great
space
around
them
the
direction
in
which
they
were
now
swimming
was
taking
them
far
out
of
their
way
aquareine
did
not
wish
to
travel
very
far
to
the
right
so
when
she
thought
they
had
gone
far
enough
to
escape
the
inky
water
she
turned
to
lead
her
party
toward
the
left
the
direction
in
which
she
did
wish
to
go
at
once
another
cloud
of
ink
stained
the
water
and
drove
them
to
the
right
again
is
anything
wrong
asked
bill
seeing
a
frown
gather
upon
the
queen
lovely
face
i
hope
not
she
said
but
i
must
warn
you
that
these
cuttlefish
are
the
servants
of
the
terrible
sea
devils
and
from
the
way
they
are
acting
they
seem
determined
to
drive
us
toward
the
devil
caves
which
i
wished
to
avoid
this
admission
on
the
part
of
their
powerful
protector
the
fairy
mermaid
sent
a
chill
to
the
hearts
of
the
earth
people
neither
spoke
for
a
time
but
finally
bill
asked
in
a
timid
voice
had
we
better
go
back
yes
decided
aquareine
after
a
moment
thought
i
think
it
will
be
wise
to
retreat
the
sea
devils
are
evidently
aware
of
our
movements
and
wish
to
annoy
us
for
my
part
i
have
no
fear
of
them
but
i
do
not
care
to
have
you
meet
such
creatures
but
when
they
turned
around
to
abandon
their
journey
another
inky
cloud
was
to
be
seen
behind
them
they
really
had
no
choice
but
to
swim
in
the
only
streak
of
clear
water
they
could
find
and
the
mermaids
well
knew
this
would
lead
them
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
caves
of
their
enemies
but
aquareine
led
the
way
moving
very
slowly
and
the
others
followed
her
in
every
other
direction
they
were
hemmed
in
by
the
black
waters
and
they
did
not
dare
to
halt
because
the
inky
fluid
crept
swiftly
up
behind
them
and
drove
them
on
the
queen
and
the
princess
had
now
become
silent
and
grave
they
swam
on
either
side
of
their
guests
as
if
to
better
protect
them
do
look
up
whispered
clia
pressing
close
to
the
little
side
why
not
asked
trot
and
then
she
did
exactly
what
she
had
been
told
not
to
do
she
lifted
her
head
and
saw
stretched
over
them
a
network
of
scrawny
crimson
arms
interlaced
like
the
branches
of
trees
in
winter
when
the
leaves
have
fallen
and
left
them
bare
bill
gave
a
start
and
muttered
land
sakes
for
he
too
had
gazed
upward
and
seen
the
crimson
network
of
limbs
are
these
the
sea
devils
asked
the
child
more
curious
than
frightened
yes
dear
replied
the
queen
but
i
advise
you
to
pay
no
attention
to
them
remember
they
can
not
touch
us
in
order
to
avoid
the
threatening
arms
overhead
which
followed
them
as
they
swam
our
friends
kept
near
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
which
was
here
thickly
covered
with
rough
and
jagged
rocks
the
inky
water
had
now
been
left
far
behind
but
when
trot
looked
over
her
shoulder
she
shuddered
to
find
a
great
crimson
monster
following
closely
after
them
with
a
dozen
long
snaky
feelers
stretched
out
as
if
to
grab
anyone
that
lagged
behind
and
there
at
the
side
of
princess
clia
was
another
devil
leering
silently
with
his
cruel
bulging
eyes
at
the
pretty
mermaid
beside
the
queen
swam
still
another
of
their
enemies
indeed
the
sea
devils
had
crept
upon
them
and
surrounded
them
everywhere
except
at
the
front
and
trot
began
to
feel
nervous
and
worried
for
the
first
time
bill
kept
mumbling
queer
words
under
his
breath
for
he
had
a
way
of
talking
to
himself
when
anything
upsot
him
as
he
would
quaintly
remark
trot
always
knew
he
was
disturbed
or
in
trouble
when
he
began
to
growl
the
only
way
now
open
was
straight
ahead
they
swam
slowly
yet
fast
enough
to
keep
a
safe
distance
from
the
dreadful
creature
behind
them
i
afraid
they
are
driving
us
into
a
trap
whispered
the
queen
softly
but
whatever
happens
do
not
lose
courage
earth
friends
clia
and
i
are
here
to
protect
you
and
our
fairy
powers
are
sufficient
to
keep
you
from
all
harm
oh
i
do
mind
so
very
much
declared
trot
calmly
it
like
the
fairy
adventures
in
storybooks
and
i
often
thought
i
like
that
kind
of
adventures
the
story
always
turns
out
the
right
way
bill
growled
something
just
then
but
the
only
words
trot
could
make
out
were
never
lived
to
tell
the
tale
oh
pshaw
she
said
we
may
be
in
danger
right
enough
an
to
be
honest
i
do
like
the
looks
of
these
sea
devils
at
all
but
i
sure
it
no
killing
matter
for
we
got
the
fairy
circles
all
around
us
ha
ha
laughed
the
monster
beside
her
we
know
all
about
the
fairy
circles
do
we
migg
ho
ho
laughed
the
monster
on
the
other
side
we
do
slibb
my
boy
and
we
do
think
much
of
fairy
circles
either
they
have
foiled
our
enemies
many
a
time
declared
the
princess
with
much
dignity
ha
ha
laughed
one
that
why
we
here
now
ho
ho
laughed
the
other
we
learned
a
trick
or
two
and
got
you
fast
this
time
then
all
the
sea
devils
those
above
and
the
one
behind
and
the
two
on
the
sides
laughed
all
together
and
their
laughter
was
so
horrible
that
it
made
even
trot
shudder
but
now
the
queen
stopped
short
and
the
others
stopped
with
her
i
will
go
no
farther
she
said
firmly
not
caring
if
the
monsters
overheard
her
it
is
evident
that
these
monsters
are
trying
to
drive
us
into
some
secret
place
and
it
is
well
known
that
they
are
in
league
with
zog
the
terrible
whom
they
serve
because
they
are
as
wicked
as
he
is
we
must
be
somewhere
near
the
hidden
castle
of
zog
so
i
prefer
to
stay
here
rather
than
be
driven
into
some
place
far
more
dangerous
as
for
the
sea
devils
they
are
powerless
to
injure
us
in
any
way
not
one
of
those
thousand
arms
about
us
can
possibly
touch
our
bodies
the
only
reply
to
this
defiant
speech
was
another
burst
of
horrible
laughter
and
now
there
suddenly
appeared
before
them
still
another
of
the
monsters
which
thus
completely
hemmed
them
in
then
the
creatures
began
interlacing
their
long
arms
or
feelers
until
they
formed
a
perfect
cage
around
the
prisoners
not
an
opening
being
left
that
was
large
enough
for
one
of
them
to
escape
through
the
mermaids
and
the
girl
and
sailor
man
kept
huddled
close
together
for
although
they
might
be
walled
in
by
the
sea
devils
their
captors
could
not
touch
them
because
of
the
protecting
magic
circles
all
at
once
trot
exclaimed
why
we
must
be
moving
this
was
startling
news
but
by
watching
the
flow
of
water
past
them
they
saw
that
the
little
girl
was
right
the
sea
devils
were
swimming
all
together
and
as
the
cage
they
were
in
moved
forward
our
friends
were
carried
with
it
queen
aquareine
had
a
stern
look
upon
her
beautiful
face
bill
guessed
from
this
look
that
the
mermaid
was
angry
for
it
seemed
much
like
the
look
trot
mother
wore
when
they
came
home
late
to
dinner
but
however
angry
the
queen
might
be
she
was
unable
to
help
herself
or
her
guests
just
now
or
to
escape
from
the
guidance
of
the
dreaded
sea
devils
the
rest
of
the
party
had
become
sober
and
thoughtful
and
in
dignified
silence
they
awaited
the
outcome
of
this
strange
adventure
chapter
the
enchanted
island
all
at
once
it
grew
dark
around
them
neither
bill
nor
trot
liked
this
gloom
for
it
made
them
nervous
not
to
be
able
to
see
their
enemies
we
must
be
near
a
sea
cavern
if
not
within
one
whispered
princess
clia
and
even
as
she
spoke
the
network
of
scarlet
arms
parted
before
them
leaving
an
avenue
for
them
to
swim
out
of
the
cage
there
was
brighter
water
ahead
too
so
the
queen
said
without
hesitation
come
along
dear
friends
but
let
us
clasp
hands
and
keep
close
together
they
obeyed
her
commands
and
swam
swiftly
out
of
their
prison
and
into
the
clear
water
before
them
glad
to
put
a
distance
between
themselves
and
the
loathesome
sea
devils
the
monsters
made
no
attempt
to
follow
them
but
they
burst
into
a
chorus
of
harsh
laughter
which
warned
our
friends
that
they
had
not
yet
accomplished
their
escape
the
four
now
found
themselves
in
a
broad
rocky
passage
which
was
dimly
lighted
from
some
unknown
source
the
walls
overhead
below
them
and
at
the
sides
all
glistened
as
if
made
of
silver
and
in
places
were
set
small
statues
of
birds
beasts
and
fishes
occupying
niches
in
the
walls
and
seemingly
made
from
the
same
glistening
material
the
queen
swam
more
slowly
now
that
the
sea
devils
had
been
left
behind
and
she
looked
exceedingly
grave
and
thoughtful
have
you
ever
been
here
before
asked
trot
no
dear
said
the
queen
with
a
sigh
and
do
you
know
where
we
are
continued
the
girl
i
can
guess
replied
aquareine
there
is
only
one
place
in
all
the
sea
where
such
a
passage
as
that
we
are
in
could
exist
without
my
knowledge
and
that
is
in
the
hidden
dominions
of
zog
if
we
are
indeed
in
the
power
of
that
fearful
magician
we
must
summon
all
our
courage
to
resist
him
or
we
are
lost
is
zog
more
powerful
than
the
mermaids
asked
trot
anxiously
i
do
not
know
for
we
have
never
before
met
to
measure
our
strength
answered
aquareine
but
if
king
anko
could
defeat
the
magician
as
he
surely
did
then
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
do
so
i
wish
i
was
sure
of
it
muttered
bill
absolute
silence
reigned
in
the
silver
passage
no
fish
were
there
not
even
a
sea
flower
grew
to
relieve
the
stern
grandeur
of
this
vast
corridor
trot
began
to
be
impressed
with
the
fact
that
she
was
a
good
way
from
her
home
and
mother
and
she
wondered
if
she
would
ever
get
back
again
to
the
white
cottage
on
the
cliff
here
she
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
great
ocean
swimming
through
a
big
tunnel
that
had
an
enchanted
castle
at
the
end
and
a
group
of
horrible
sea
devils
at
the
other
in
spite
of
this
thought
she
was
not
very
much
afraid
although
two
fairy
mermaids
were
her
companions
she
relied
strange
to
say
more
upon
her
tried
and
true
friend
bill
than
upon
her
newer
acquaintances
to
see
her
safely
out
of
her
present
trouble
bill
himself
did
not
feel
very
confident
i
do
care
two
cents
what
becomes
o
me
he
told
princess
clia
in
a
low
voice
but
i
worried
over
our
trot
she
too
sweet
an
young
to
be
made
an
end
of
in
this
fashion
clia
smiled
at
this
speech
i
sure
you
will
find
the
little
girl
end
a
good
way
off
she
replied
trust
to
our
powerful
queen
and
be
sure
she
will
find
some
means
for
us
all
to
escape
uninjured
the
light
grew
brighter
as
they
advanced
until
finally
they
perceived
a
magnificent
archway
just
ahead
of
them
aquareine
hesitated
a
moment
whether
to
go
on
or
turn
back
but
there
was
no
escaping
the
sea
devils
behind
them
and
she
decided
the
best
way
out
of
their
difficulties
was
to
bravely
face
the
unknown
zog
and
rely
upon
her
fairy
powers
to
prevent
his
doing
any
mischief
to
herself
or
her
friends
so
she
led
the
way
and
together
they
approached
the
archway
and
passed
through
it
they
now
found
themselves
in
a
vast
cavern
so
great
in
extent
that
the
dome
overhead
looked
like
the
sky
when
seen
from
earth
in
the
center
of
this
immense
sea
cavern
rose
the
towers
of
a
splendid
castle
all
built
of
coral
inlaid
with
silver
and
having
windows
of
clear
glass
surrounding
the
castle
were
beds
of
beautiful
sea
flowers
many
being
in
full
bloom
and
these
were
laid
out
with
great
care
in
artistic
designs
goldfish
and
silverfish
darted
here
and
there
among
the
foliage
and
the
whole
scene
was
so
pretty
and
peaceful
that
trot
began
to
doubt
there
was
any
danger
lurking
in
such
a
lovely
place
as
they
approached
to
look
around
them
a
brilliantly
colored
gregfish
approached
and
gazed
at
them
curiously
with
his
big
eyes
so
zog
has
got
you
at
last
he
said
in
a
pitying
tone
how
foolish
you
were
to
swim
into
that
part
of
the
sea
where
he
is
powerful
the
sea
devils
made
us
explained
clia
well
i
sorry
for
you
i
sure
remarked
the
greg
and
with
a
flash
of
his
tail
he
disappeared
among
the
sea
foliage
let
us
go
to
the
castle
said
the
queen
in
a
determined
voice
we
may
as
well
boldly
defy
our
fate
as
to
wait
until
zog
seeks
us
out
so
they
swam
to
the
entrance
of
the
castle
the
doors
stood
wide
open
and
the
interior
seemed
as
well
lighted
as
the
cavern
itself
although
none
of
them
could
discover
from
whence
the
light
came
at
each
side
of
the
entrance
lay
a
fish
such
as
they
had
never
seen
before
it
was
flat
as
a
doormat
and
seemed
to
cling
fast
to
the
coral
floor
upon
its
back
were
quills
like
those
of
a
porcupine
all
pointed
and
sharp
from
the
center
of
the
fish
arose
a
head
shaped
like
a
round
ball
with
a
circle
of
piercing
eyes
set
in
it
these
strange
guardians
of
the
entrance
might
be
able
to
tell
what
their
numerous
eyes
saw
yet
they
remained
silent
and
watchful
even
aquareine
gazed
upon
them
curiously
and
she
gave
a
little
shudder
as
she
did
so
inside
the
entrance
was
a
domed
hall
with
a
flight
of
stairs
leading
to
an
upper
balcony
around
the
hall
were
several
doorways
hung
with
curtains
made
of
woven
seaweeds
chairs
and
benches
stood
against
the
wall
and
these
astonished
the
visitors
because
neither
stairs
nor
chairs
seemed
useful
in
a
kingdom
where
every
living
thing
was
supposed
to
swim
and
have
a
fish
tail
in
queen
palaces
benches
for
reclining
were
used
and
stairs
were
wholly
unnecessary
but
in
the
palace
of
zog
the
furniture
and
fittings
were
much
like
those
of
a
house
upon
earth
and
except
that
every
space
here
was
filled
with
water
instead
of
air
trot
and
bill
might
have
imagined
themselves
in
a
handsome
earthly
castle
the
little
group
paused
half
fearfully
in
the
hall
yet
so
far
there
was
surely
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
they
were
wondering
what
to
do
next
when
the
curtains
of
an
archway
were
pushed
aside
and
a
boy
entered
to
trot
astonishment
he
had
legs
and
walked
upon
them
naturally
and
with
perfect
ease
he
was
a
delicate
little
fellow
dressed
in
a
black
velvet
suit
with
knee
breeches
the
bows
at
his
throat
and
knees
were
of
colored
seaweeds
woven
into
broad
ribbons
his
hair
was
yellow
and
banged
across
his
forehead
his
eyes
were
large
and
dark
with
a
pleasant
merry
sparkle
in
them
around
his
neck
he
wore
a
high
ruff
but
in
spite
of
this
trot
could
see
that
below
his
plump
cheeks
were
several
slits
that
looked
like
the
gills
of
fishes
for
they
gently
opened
and
closed
as
the
boy
breathed
in
the
water
by
which
he
was
surrounded
these
gills
did
not
greatly
mar
the
delicate
beauty
and
he
spread
out
his
arms
and
bowed
low
and
gracefully
in
greeting
hello
said
trot
why
i
like
to
replied
the
boy
with
a
laugh
but
being
a
mere
slave
it
is
proper
for
me
to
hello
but
it
good
to
see
earth
people
again
and
i
glad
you
here
we
not
glad
observed
the
girl
we
afraid
you
get
over
that
declared
the
boy
smilingly
people
lose
a
lot
of
time
being
afraid
once
i
was
myself
afraid
but
i
found
it
was
no
fun
so
i
gave
it
up
why
were
we
brought
here
inquired
queen
aquareine
gently
i
ca
say
madam
being
a
mere
slave
replied
the
boy
but
you
have
reminded
me
of
my
errand
i
am
sent
to
inform
you
all
that
zog
the
forsaken
who
hates
all
the
world
and
is
hated
by
all
the
world
commands
your
presence
in
his
den
do
you
hate
zog
too
asked
trot
oh
no
answered
the
boy
people
lose
a
lot
of
time
in
hating
others
and
there
no
fun
in
it
at
all
zog
may
be
hateful
but
not
going
to
waste
time
hating
him
you
may
do
so
if
you
like
you
are
a
queer
child
remarked
the
mermaid
queen
looking
at
him
attentively
will
you
tell
us
who
you
are
once
i
was
prince
sacho
of
sacharhineolaland
which
is
a
sweet
country
but
hard
to
pronounce
he
answered
but
in
this
domain
i
have
but
one
title
and
one
name
and
that
is
how
came
you
to
be
zog
slave
asked
clia
the
funniest
adventure
you
ever
heard
of
asserted
the
boy
with
eager
pride
i
sailed
in
a
ship
that
went
to
pieces
in
a
storm
all
on
board
were
drowned
but
me
and
i
came
mighty
near
it
to
tell
the
truth
i
went
down
deep
deep
into
the
sea
and
at
the
bottom
was
zog
watching
the
people
drown
i
tumbled
on
his
head
and
he
grabbed
and
saved
me
saying
i
would
make
a
useful
slave
by
his
magic
power
he
made
me
able
to
live
under
water
as
the
fishes
live
and
he
brought
me
to
this
castle
and
taught
me
to
wait
upon
him
as
his
other
slaves
do
is
it
a
dreadful
lonely
life
asked
trot
no
indeed
said
sacho
we
have
any
time
to
be
lonely
and
the
dreadful
things
zog
does
are
very
exciting
and
amusing
i
assure
you
he
keeps
us
guessing
every
minute
and
that
makes
the
life
here
interesting
things
were
getting
a
bit
slow
an
hour
ago
but
now
that
you
are
here
i
in
hopes
we
will
all
be
kept
busy
and
amused
for
some
time
are
there
many
others
in
the
castle
besides
you
and
zog
asked
aquareine
dozens
of
us
perhaps
hundreds
i
never
counted
them
said
the
boy
but
zog
is
the
only
master
all
the
rest
of
us
are
in
the
same
class
so
there
is
no
jealousy
among
the
slaves
what
is
zog
like
bill
questioned
at
this
the
boy
laughed
and
the
laugh
was
full
of
mischief
if
i
could
tell
you
what
zog
is
like
it
would
take
me
a
year
was
the
reply
but
i
ca
tell
you
every
one
has
a
different
idea
of
what
he
like
and
soon
you
will
see
him
yourselves
are
you
fond
of
him
asked
trot
if
i
said
yes
i
get
a
good
whipping
declared
sacho
i
am
commanded
to
hate
zog
and
being
a
good
servant
i
try
to
obey
if
anyone
dared
to
like
zog
i
am
sure
he
be
instantly
fed
to
the
turtles
so
i
advise
you
not
to
like
him
oh
we
wo
promised
trot
but
we
keeping
the
master
waiting
and
that
is
also
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
continued
the
boy
if
we
do
hurry
up
zog
will
begin
to
smile
and
when
he
smiles
there
is
trouble
brewing
the
queen
sighed
lead
the
way
sacho
she
said
we
will
follow
the
boy
bowed
again
and
going
to
an
archway
held
aside
the
curtains
for
them
they
first
swam
into
a
small
anteroom
which
led
into
a
long
corridor
at
the
end
of
which
was
another
curtained
arch
through
this
sacho
also
guided
them
and
now
they
found
themselves
in
a
cleverly
constructed
maze
every
few
feet
were
twists
and
turns
and
sharp
corners
and
sometimes
the
passage
would
be
wide
and
again
so
narrow
that
they
could
just
squeeze
through
in
single
file
seems
like
we
gettin
further
into
the
trap
growled
bill
we
could
find
our
way
out
o
here
to
save
our
lives
oh
yes
we
could
replied
clia
who
was
just
behind
him
such
a
maze
may
indeed
puzzle
you
but
the
queen
or
i
could
lead
you
safely
through
it
again
i
assure
you
zog
is
not
so
clever
as
he
thinks
himself
the
sailor
however
found
the
maze
very
bewildering
and
so
did
trot
passages
ran
in
every
direction
crossing
and
recrossing
and
it
seemed
wonderful
that
the
boy
sacho
knew
just
which
way
to
go
but
he
never
hesitated
an
instant
trot
looked
carefully
to
see
if
there
were
any
marks
to
guide
him
but
every
wall
was
of
plain
polished
marble
and
every
turning
looked
just
like
all
the
others
suddenly
sacho
stopped
short
they
were
now
in
a
broader
passage
but
as
they
gathered
around
their
conductor
they
found
further
advance
blocked
solid
walls
faced
them
and
here
the
corridor
seemed
to
end
enter
said
a
clear
voice
but
we
ca
protested
trot
swim
straight
ahead
whispered
the
boy
in
soft
tones
there
is
no
real
barrier
before
you
your
eyes
are
merely
deceived
by
magic
ah
i
understand
said
aquareine
nodding
her
pretty
head
and
then
she
took
mayre
hand
and
swam
boldly
forward
while
bill
followed
holding
the
hand
of
clia
and
behold
the
marble
wall
melted
away
before
them
and
they
found
themselves
in
a
chamber
more
splendid
than
even
the
fairy
mermaids
had
ever
seen
before
chapter
prisoners
of
the
sea
monster
the
room
in
the
enchanted
castle
which
zog
called
the
den
and
in
which
the
wicked
sea
monster
passed
most
of
his
time
was
a
perfectly
shaped
dome
of
solid
gold
the
upper
part
of
this
dome
was
thickly
set
with
precious
jewels
diamonds
rubies
sapphires
and
emeralds
which
sparkled
beautifully
through
the
crystal
water
the
lower
walls
were
as
thickly
studded
with
pearls
all
being
of
perfect
shape
and
color
many
of
the
pearls
were
larger
than
any
which
may
be
found
upon
earth
for
the
sea
people
knew
where
to
find
the
very
best
and
hide
them
away
where
men
can
not
discover
them
the
golden
floor
was
engraved
with
designs
of
rare
beauty
depicting
not
only
sea
life
but
many
adventures
upon
land
in
the
room
were
several
large
golden
cabinets
the
doors
of
which
were
closed
and
locked
and
in
addition
to
the
cabinets
there
were
tables
chairs
and
sofas
the
latter
upholstered
with
softest
sealskins
handsome
rugs
of
exquisitely
woven
seaweeds
were
scattered
about
the
colors
of
which
were
artistically
blended
together
in
one
corner
a
fountain
of
air
bubbled
up
through
the
water
the
entire
room
was
lighted
as
brilliantly
as
if
exposed
to
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
yet
where
this
light
came
from
our
friends
could
not
imagine
no
lamp
or
other
similar
device
was
visible
anywhere
the
strangers
at
first
scarcely
glanced
at
all
these
beautiful
things
for
in
an
easy
chair
sat
zog
himself
more
wonderful
than
any
other
living
creature
and
as
they
gazed
upon
him
their
eyes
seemed
fascinated
as
if
held
by
a
spell
zog
face
was
the
face
of
a
man
except
that
the
tops
of
his
ears
were
pointed
like
horns
and
he
had
small
horns
instead
of
eyebrows
and
a
horn
on
the
end
of
his
chin
in
spite
of
these
deformities
the
expression
of
the
face
was
not
unpleasant
or
repulsive
his
hair
was
carefully
parted
and
brushed
and
his
mouth
and
nose
were
not
only
perfect
in
shape
but
quite
handsome
only
the
eyes
betrayed
zog
and
made
him
terrible
to
all
beholders
they
seemed
like
coals
of
glowing
fire
and
sparkled
so
fiercely
that
no
one
ever
cared
to
meet
their
gaze
for
more
than
an
instant
perhaps
the
monster
realized
this
for
he
usually
drooped
his
long
lashes
over
his
fiery
eyes
to
shut
out
their
glare
zog
had
two
legs
which
ended
in
the
hoofs
of
beasts
instead
of
feet
and
these
hoofs
were
shod
with
gold
his
body
was
a
shapeless
mass
covered
with
richly
embroidered
raiment
over
which
a
great
robe
of
cloth
of
gold
fell
in
many
folds
this
robe
was
intended
to
hide
the
magician
body
from
view
but
trot
noticed
that
the
cloth
moved
constantly
in
little
ripples
as
if
what
lay
underneath
would
not
keep
still
the
best
features
of
which
zog
could
boast
were
his
arms
and
hands
the
latter
being
as
well
formed
as
delicate
and
white
as
those
of
a
woman
when
he
spoke
his
voice
sounded
sweet
and
clear
and
its
tones
were
very
gentle
he
had
given
them
a
few
moments
to
stare
at
him
for
he
was
examining
them
in
turn
with
considerable
curiosity
well
said
he
do
you
not
find
me
the
most
hateful
creature
you
have
ever
beheld
the
queen
refrained
from
answering
but
trot
said
promptly
we
do
nothing
could
be
more
horrider
or
more
disgustin
than
you
are
it
seems
to
me
very
good
very
good
indeed
declared
the
monster
lifting
his
lashes
to
flash
his
glowing
eyes
upon
them
then
he
turned
toward
bill
he
continued
what
do
you
think
of
me
mighty
little
the
sailor
replied
you
orter
be
to
ask
sech
a
question
knowin
you
look
worse
ner
the
devil
himself
very
true
answered
zog
frowning
he
felt
that
he
had
received
a
high
compliment
and
the
frown
showed
he
was
pleased
with
bill
but
now
queen
aquareine
advanced
to
a
position
in
front
of
their
captor
and
said
tell
me
zog
why
have
you
trapped
us
and
brought
us
here
to
destroy
you
was
the
quick
answer
and
the
magician
turned
for
an
instant
to
flash
his
eyes
upon
the
beautiful
mermaid
for
two
hundred
years
i
have
been
awaiting
a
chance
to
get
within
my
power
some
friend
of
anko
the
sea
serpent
of
anko
whom
i
hate
he
added
smiling
sweetly
when
you
left
your
palace
today
my
swift
spies
warned
me
and
so
i
sent
the
sea
devils
to
capture
you
often
have
they
tried
to
do
this
before
but
always
failed
today
acting
by
my
command
they
tricked
you
and
by
surrounding
you
forced
you
to
the
entrance
of
my
enchanted
castle
the
result
is
a
fine
capture
of
important
personages
i
have
now
in
my
power
the
queen
and
princess
of
the
fairy
mermaids
as
well
as
two
wandering
earth
people
and
i
assure
you
i
shall
take
great
pleasure
in
destroying
you
utterly
you
are
a
coward
declared
the
queen
proudly
you
dared
not
meet
us
in
the
open
sea
no
i
dare
not
leave
this
castle
zog
admitted
still
smiling
but
here
in
my
own
domain
my
power
is
supreme
nothing
can
interfere
with
my
vengeance
that
remains
to
be
seen
said
aquareine
firmly
meeting
the
gaze
of
the
terrible
eyes
of
course
he
answered
nodding
his
head
with
a
graceful
movement
you
will
try
to
thwart
me
and
escape
you
will
pit
your
fairy
power
against
my
powers
of
magic
that
will
give
me
great
pleasure
for
the
more
you
struggle
the
greater
will
be
my
revenge
but
why
should
you
seek
revenge
upon
us
asked
clia
we
have
never
harmed
you
that
is
true
replied
zog
i
bear
you
no
personal
ill
will
but
you
are
friends
of
my
great
enemy
king
anko
and
it
will
annoy
him
very
much
when
he
finds
that
you
have
been
destroyed
by
me
i
can
not
hurt
the
rascally
old
sea
serpent
himself
but
through
you
i
can
make
him
feel
my
vengeance
the
mermaids
have
existed
thousands
of
years
said
the
queen
in
a
tone
of
pride
do
you
imagine
the
despised
and
conquered
zog
has
power
to
destroy
them
i
do
not
know
was
the
quiet
answer
it
will
be
interesting
to
discover
which
is
the
more
powerful
i
challenge
you
to
begin
the
test
at
once
vile
magician
exclaimed
aquareine
there
is
no
hurry
fair
queen
answered
zog
in
his
softest
tones
i
have
been
so
many
years
in
accomplishing
your
capture
that
it
is
foolish
to
act
hastily
now
besides
i
am
lonely
here
in
my
forced
retirement
i
see
only
those
uninteresting
earth
mortals
whom
i
have
made
my
slaves
for
all
sea
dwellers
are
forbidden
to
serve
me
save
the
sea
devils
and
they
dare
not
enter
my
castle
i
have
saved
many
mortals
from
drowning
and
brought
them
here
to
people
my
castle
but
i
do
not
love
mortals
two
lovely
mermaids
are
much
more
interesting
and
before
i
allow
you
to
perish
i
shall
have
much
amusement
in
witnessing
your
despair
and
your
struggles
to
escape
you
are
now
my
prisoners
by
slow
degrees
i
shall
wear
out
your
fairy
powers
and
break
your
hearts
as
well
as
the
hearts
of
these
earth
dwellers
who
have
no
magic
powers
and
i
think
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
i
finally
permit
you
to
die
that
all
right
said
trot
cheerfully
the
longer
you
take
the
better
i
be
satisfied
that
how
i
feel
about
it
added
bill
do
get
in
a
hurry
to
kill
us
zog
it
be
such
a
wear
an
tear
on
your
nerves
jes
take
it
easy
an
let
us
live
as
long
as
we
can
do
you
care
to
die
asked
the
magician
it
a
thing
i
never
longed
for
the
sailor
replied
you
see
we
had
no
business
to
go
on
a
trip
with
the
mermaids
to
begin
with
i
allus
heard
tell
that
mermaids
is
dangerous
an
no
one
as
met
ever
lived
to
tell
the
tale
eh
trot
that
what
you
said
bill
so
i
guess
we
done
for
one
way
an
it
do
matter
much
which
but
trot
a
good
child
an
mighty
young
an
tender
it
do
seem
like
her
time
has
come
to
die
i
like
to
have
her
sent
safe
home
to
her
mother
so
i
got
this
proposition
to
make
zog
if
your
magic
could
make
me
die
twice
or
even
three
times
fer
good
measure
why
you
go
ahead
an
do
it
an
i
wo
complain
all
i
ask
is
fer
you
to
send
this
little
girl
safe
back
to
dry
land
again
do
you
do
it
zog
cried
trot
indignantly
and
turning
to
bill
she
added
i
not
goin
to
leave
you
down
here
in
all
this
mess
and
do
you
think
it
if
one
of
us
gets
out
of
the
muddle
we
in
we
both
get
out
so
do
you
make
any
bargains
with
zog
to
die
twice
zog
listened
to
this
conversation
very
carefully
the
dying
does
not
amount
to
much
he
said
it
is
the
thinking
about
it
that
hurts
you
mortals
most
i
watched
many
a
shipwreck
at
sea
and
the
people
would
howl
and
scream
for
hours
before
the
ship
broke
up
their
terror
was
very
enjoyable
but
when
the
end
came
they
all
drowned
as
peacefully
as
if
they
were
going
to
sleep
so
it
amuse
me
at
all
i
not
worrying
said
trot
ner
me
said
bill
you
find
we
can
take
what
comes
as
easy
as
anybody
i
do
not
expect
to
get
much
from
you
poor
mortals
said
zog
carelessly
you
are
merely
a
side
show
to
my
circus
a
sort
of
dessert
to
my
feast
of
vengeance
when
the
time
comes
i
can
find
a
hundred
ways
to
kill
you
my
most
interesting
prisoners
are
these
pretty
mermaids
who
claim
that
none
of
their
race
has
ever
yet
died
or
been
destroyed
the
first
mermaid
ever
created
is
living
yet
and
i
am
told
she
is
none
other
than
queen
aquareine
so
i
have
a
pretty
problem
before
me
to
invent
some
way
to
destroy
the
mermaids
or
put
them
out
of
existence
and
it
will
require
some
thought
also
it
will
require
some
power
you
do
not
possess
suggested
the
queen
that
may
be
replied
zog
softly
but
i
am
going
to
experiment
and
i
believe
i
shall
be
able
to
cause
you
a
lot
of
pain
and
sorrow
before
i
finally
make
an
end
of
you
i
have
not
lived
thousand
years
aquareine
without
getting
a
certain
amount
of
wisdom
and
i
am
more
powerful
than
you
suspect
you
are
a
monster
and
a
wicked
magician
said
the
mermaid
queen
i
am
agreed
zog
but
i
can
not
help
it
i
was
created
part
man
part
bird
part
fish
part
beast
and
part
reptile
and
such
a
monstrosity
could
not
be
otherwise
than
wicked
everybody
hates
me
and
i
hate
everybody
why
do
you
kill
yourself
asked
trot
i
tried
that
and
failed
he
answered
only
one
being
in
the
world
has
power
to
destroy
me
and
that
is
king
anko
the
sea
serpent
then
you
better
let
him
do
it
advised
the
little
girl
no
much
as
i
long
to
die
i
can
not
allow
king
anko
the
pleasure
of
killing
me
he
has
always
been
my
worst
enemy
and
it
would
be
such
a
joy
to
him
to
kill
me
that
i
really
can
not
allow
him
indeed
i
have
always
hoped
to
kill
anko
i
have
now
been
three
thousand
six
hundred
and
years
eleven
months
and
nine
days
figuring
out
a
plan
to
destroy
old
anko
and
as
yet
i
have
not
discovered
a
way
i
give
it
up
if
i
were
you
advised
trot
do
you
think
you
could
get
some
fun
out
of
trying
to
be
good
no
cried
zog
and
his
voice
was
not
so
soft
as
before
listen
aquareine
you
and
your
attendants
shall
be
prisoners
in
this
castle
until
i
can
manage
to
stop
you
from
living
rooms
will
be
placed
at
your
disposal
and
i
wish
you
to
go
to
them
at
o
nce
as
i
am
tired
of
looking
at
you
you
no
more
tired
than
we
are
remarked
trot
it
lucky
you
ca
see
yourself
zog
he
turned
his
glowing
eyes
full
upon
her
the
worst
of
my
queer
body
i
keep
concealed
he
said
if
ever
you
see
it
you
will
scream
with
terror
he
touched
a
bell
beside
him
and
the
girl
was
surprised
to
find
how
clearly
its
tones
rang
out
through
the
water
in
an
instant
the
boy
sacho
appeared
and
bowed
low
before
his
dreadful
master
take
the
mermaids
and
the
child
to
the
rose
chamber
commanded
zog
and
take
the
old
to
the
peony
room
sacho
turned
to
obey
are
the
outer
passages
well
guarded
asked
the
monster
yes
as
you
have
commanded
said
the
boy
then
you
may
allow
the
prisoners
to
roam
at
will
throughout
the
castle
now
go
the
prisoners
followed
sacho
from
the
room
glad
to
get
away
the
presence
of
this
evil
being
had
grown
oppressive
to
them
and
zog
had
himself
seemed
ill
at
ease
during
the
last
few
minutes
the
robe
so
closely
wound
around
his
body
moved
jerkily
as
if
something
beneath
disturbed
it
and
at
such
times
zog
shifted
nervously
in
his
seat
sacho
thin
little
legs
trotted
through
the
water
and
led
the
way
into
a
different
passage
from
the
one
by
which
they
had
entered
they
swam
slowly
after
him
and
breathed
easier
when
they
had
left
the
golden
domed
chamber
where
their
wicked
enemy
sat
enthroned
well
how
do
you
like
him
asked
sacho
with
a
laugh
we
hate
him
declared
trot
emphatically
of
course
you
do
replied
sacho
but
you
wasting
time
hating
anything
it
does
do
you
any
good
or
him
any
harm
can
you
sing
a
little
said
trot
but
i
do
feel
like
singing
now
you
wrong
about
that
the
boy
asserted
anything
that
keeps
you
from
singing
is
foolishness
unless
it
laughter
laughter
joy
and
song
are
the
only
good
things
in
the
world
trot
did
not
answer
this
queer
speech
for
just
then
they
came
to
a
flight
of
stairs
and
sacho
climbed
up
them
while
the
others
swam
and
now
they
were
in
a
lofty
broad
corridor
having
many
doors
hung
with
seaweed
draperies
at
one
of
these
doorways
sacho
stopped
and
said
here
is
the
rose
chamber
where
the
master
commands
you
to
live
until
you
die
you
may
wander
anywhere
in
the
castle
as
you
please
to
leave
it
is
impossible
whenever
you
return
to
the
rose
chamber
you
will
know
it
by
this
design
of
roses
sewn
in
pearls
upon
the
hangings
the
peony
room
where
the
is
to
live
is
the
next
one
farther
on
thank
you
replied
queen
aquareine
are
we
to
be
fed
meals
will
be
served
in
your
rooms
if
you
desire
anything
ring
the
bell
and
some
of
the
slaves
will
be
sure
to
answer
it
i
am
mostly
in
attendance
upon
my
master
but
whenever
i
am
at
liberty
i
will
look
after
your
comfort
myself
again
they
thanked
the
strange
boy
and
he
turned
and
left
them
they
could
hear
him
whistle
and
sing
as
he
returned
along
the
passage
then
princess
clia
parted
the
curtains
that
her
queen
and
companions
might
enter
the
rose
chamber
chapter
joe
and
bill
the
rooms
zog
had
given
his
prisoners
were
as
handsome
as
all
other
parts
of
this
strange
enchanted
castle
gold
was
used
plentifully
in
the
decorations
and
in
the
rose
chamber
occupied
by
the
mermaids
and
trot
golden
roses
formed
a
border
around
the
entire
room
the
sea
maidens
had
evidently
been
expected
for
the
magician
had
provided
couches
for
them
to
recline
upon
similar
to
the
ones
used
in
the
mermaid
palaces
the
frames
were
of
mother
of
pearl
and
the
cushions
of
soft
white
sponges
in
the
room
were
toilet
tables
mirrors
ornaments
and
many
articles
used
by
earth
people
which
they
afterward
learned
had
been
plundered
by
zog
from
sunken
ships
and
brought
to
his
castle
by
his
allies
the
sea
devils
while
the
mermaids
were
examining
and
admiring
their
room
bill
went
to
the
peony
room
to
see
what
it
was
like
and
found
his
quarters
were
very
cozy
and
interesting
there
were
pictures
on
the
wall
portraits
of
porpoises
bashful
seals
and
smug
and
smiling
walruses
some
of
the
wall
panels
were
formed
of
mirrors
and
reflected
clearly
the
interior
of
the
room
around
the
ceiling
was
a
frieze
of
imitation
peonies
in
silver
and
the
furniture
was
the
broad
leaves
being
bent
to
form
seats
and
couches
beside
a
pretty
dressing
table
hung
a
bell
cord
with
a
tassel
at
the
end
bill
did
not
know
it
was
a
bell
cord
so
he
pulled
it
to
see
what
would
happen
and
was
puzzled
to
find
that
nothing
seemed
to
happen
at
all
the
bell
being
too
far
away
for
him
to
hear
it
then
he
began
looking
at
the
treasures
contained
in
this
royal
apartment
and
was
much
pleased
with
a
golden
statue
of
a
mermaid
that
resembled
princess
clia
in
feature
a
silver
flower
vase
upon
a
stand
contained
a
bouquet
of
gorgeous
peonies
as
as
life
said
bill
although
he
saw
plainly
that
they
must
be
made
of
metal
trot
came
in
just
then
to
see
how
her
dear
friend
was
located
she
entered
from
the
doorway
that
connected
the
two
rooms
and
said
is
it
pretty
and
who
ever
think
that
awful
creature
zog
owned
such
a
splendid
castle
and
kept
his
prisoners
in
such
lovely
rooms
i
once
heard
tell
said
the
sailor
of
a
foreign
people
that
sacrificed
humans
to
please
their
pagan
gods
an
before
they
killed
outright
they
stuffed
the
victims
full
of
good
things
to
eat
dressed
in
pretty
clothes
an
treated
like
princes
why
i
do
take
much
comfort
in
our
fine
surroundin
trot
this
zog
is
a
pagan
if
ever
there
was
one
an
he
do
mean
us
any
good
you
may
depend
on
no
replied
trot
soberly
i
sure
he
does
not
expect
us
to
be
happy
here
but
i
going
to
fool
him
and
have
just
as
good
a
time
as
i
can
as
she
spoke
they
both
turned
around
an
easy
thing
to
do
with
a
single
flop
of
their
flexible
tails
and
bill
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
just
across
the
room
stood
a
perfect
duplicate
of
himself
the
round
head
with
its
bald
top
and
scraggly
whiskers
the
sailor
cap
and
shirt
the
wide
pantaloons
even
the
wooden
leg
each
and
every
one
were
exact
copies
of
those
owned
by
bill
even
the
expression
in
the
eyes
was
the
same
and
it
is
no
wonder
the
old
sailor
stared
at
his
double
in
amazement
but
the
next
minute
he
laughed
and
said
why
trot
it
me
reflected
in
a
mirror
but
at
first
i
thought
it
was
someone
else
trot
was
staring
too
look
she
whispered
look
at
the
wooden
leg
well
it
my
wooden
leg
ai
it
he
inquired
if
it
is
it
ca
be
a
reflection
in
a
mirror
she
argued
for
you
have
got
a
wooden
leg
you
got
a
fish
tail
the
old
sailor
was
so
startled
by
this
truth
that
he
gave
a
great
flop
with
his
tail
that
upset
his
balance
and
made
him
keel
a
somersault
in
the
water
before
he
got
right
side
up
again
then
he
found
the
other
sailor
man
laughing
at
him
and
was
horrified
to
find
the
reflection
advancing
toward
them
by
stumping
along
on
its
wooden
leg
keep
away
get
out
there
yelled
bill
a
ghost
the
ghost
o
me
that
once
was
an
i
ca
bear
the
sight
o
you
git
out
did
you
ring
jes
to
tell
me
to
git
out
asked
the
other
in
a
mild
voice
i
i
did
ring
declared
bill
you
did
you
pulled
that
bell
cord
said
the
one
or
more
lines
missing
here
in
this
edition
oh
did
pullin
that
thing
ring
a
bell
inquired
the
a
little
ashamed
of
his
ignorance
and
reassured
by
hearing
the
ghost
talk
it
surely
did
was
the
reply
and
sacho
told
me
to
answer
your
bell
and
look
after
you
so
i
after
you
i
wish
you
would
protested
bill
i
no
use
fer
fer
ghostses
anyhow
the
strange
sailor
began
to
chuckle
at
hearing
this
and
his
chuckle
was
just
like
bill
chuckle
so
full
of
merry
humor
that
it
usually
made
everyone
laugh
with
him
who
are
you
asked
trot
who
was
very
curious
and
much
surprised
i
joe
was
the
reply
joe
weedles
formerly
o
the
brig
an
now
a
slave
o
zog
at
the
bottom
o
the
sea
j
j
joe
gasped
bill
amazed
joe
weedles
the
why
dash
my
eyes
mate
you
must
be
my
brother
are
you
bill
weedles
asked
the
other
and
then
he
added
but
no
you
ca
be
bill
was
no
mermaid
he
were
a
human
critter
like
myself
that
what
i
am
said
bill
hastily
i
a
human
critter
too
i
jes
borrered
this
fish
tail
to
swim
with
while
visitin
the
mermaids
well
well
said
joe
in
astonishment
who
o
thought
it
an
who
ever
o
thought
as
i
find
my
brother
in
enchanted
castle
full
fifty
fathoms
deep
down
in
the
wet
wet
water
why
as
fer
that
replied
bill
it
you
as
is
the
brother
not
me
you
an
your
ship
disappeared
many
a
year
ago
an
ai
never
been
heard
of
since
while
as
you
see
livin
on
earth
yet
you
do
look
it
to
all
appearances
remarked
joe
in
a
reflective
tone
of
voice
but
i
agree
it
many
a
year
since
i
saw
the
top
o
the
water
an
i
not
expectin
to
ever
tramp
on
dry
land
again
are
you
dead
or
drownded
or
what
asked
bill
neither
one
nor
was
the
answer
but
zog
gave
me
gills
so
i
could
live
in
the
water
like
fishes
do
an
if
i
got
on
land
i
could
breathe
air
any
a
fish
out
o
water
can
so
i
guess
as
long
as
i
live
i
hev
to
stay
down
here
do
you
like
it
asked
trot
oh
i
do
objec
much
said
joe
there
ai
much
excitement
here
fer
we
do
catch
a
flock
o
mermaids
day
but
the
work
is
easy
an
the
rations
fair
i
might
o
been
worse
off
you
know
for
when
my
brig
was
wrecked
i
gone
to
davy
jones
locker
if
zog
had
happened
to
find
me
an
made
me
a
fish
you
do
look
as
much
like
a
fish
as
bill
does
observed
trot
not
said
joe
but
i
notice
bill
ai
got
any
gills
an
breathes
like
you
an
the
mermaids
does
when
he
gets
back
to
land
he
have
his
two
legs
again
an
live
in
comfort
air
i
wo
have
two
legs
asserted
bill
for
when
i
on
earth
i
fitted
with
one
wooden
leg
jes
the
same
as
you
are
joe
oh
i
had
heard
o
that
bill
but
i
not
surprised
replied
brother
joe
many
a
sailor
gets
to
wear
a
wooden
leg
in
time
mine
so
mine
said
bill
with
a
air
of
pride
i
glad
i
run
across
you
joe
for
i
often
wondered
what
had
become
of
you
seems
too
bad
though
to
have
to
spend
all
your
life
under
water
what
the
odds
asked
joe
i
never
could
keep
away
from
the
water
since
i
was
a
boy
an
there
more
dangers
to
be
met
floatin
on
it
than
there
is
soakin
in
it
an
one
other
thing
pleases
me
when
i
think
on
it
i
parted
from
my
wife
a
mighty
good
woman
with
a
tongue
like
a
sword
an
my
pore
widder
get
the
insurance
money
an
live
happy
as
fer
me
bill
i
a
good
deal
happier
than
i
was
when
she
kep
scoldin
me
from
mornin
to
night
every
minute
i
was
home
is
zog
a
kind
master
asked
trot
i
ca
say
he
kind
replied
joe
for
he
as
near
a
devil
as
any
livin
critter
can
be
he
grumbles
an
growls
in
his
soft
voice
all
day
an
hates
himself
an
everybody
else
but
i
do
see
much
of
him
there
so
many
of
us
slaves
here
that
zog
do
pay
much
attention
to
us
an
we
have
a
pretty
good
time
when
the
ol
magician
is
shut
up
in
his
den
as
he
mostly
is
could
you
help
us
to
escape
asked
the
child
why
i
do
know
how
admitted
joe
there
magic
all
around
us
and
we
slaves
are
never
allowed
to
leave
this
great
cave
i
do
what
i
can
o
course
but
sacho
is
the
boy
to
help
you
if
anyone
can
that
little
chap
knows
a
heap
i
can
tell
you
so
now
if
nothin
more
wanted
i
must
get
back
to
work
what
work
do
you
do
bill
asked
i
sew
buttons
on
zog
clothes
every
time
he
gets
mad
he
busts
his
buttons
off
an
i
have
to
sew
on
again
as
he
mad
most
the
time
it
keeps
me
busy
i
see
you
again
wo
i
joe
said
bill
no
reason
why
you
should
if
you
manage
to
keep
alive
said
joe
but
you
must
forget
bill
this
zog
has
his
grip
on
you
an
i
never
known
anything
to
escape
him
yet
saying
this
the
old
sailor
began
to
stump
toward
the
door
but
tripped
his
foot
against
his
wooden
leg
and
gave
a
swift
dive
forward
he
would
have
fallen
flat
had
he
not
grabbed
the
drapery
at
the
doorway
and
saved
himself
by
holding
fast
to
it
with
both
hands
even
then
he
rolled
and
twisted
so
awkwardly
before
he
could
get
upon
his
legs
that
trot
had
to
laugh
outright
at
his
antics
this
leg
said
joe
is
so
blamed
light
that
it
always
wants
to
float
the
goldworker
has
promised
me
a
gold
leg
that
will
stay
down
but
he
never
has
time
to
make
it
mighty
lucky
bill
to
have
a
merman
tail
instead
o
legs
i
guess
i
am
joe
replied
bill
for
in
such
a
wet
country
the
fishes
have
the
best
of
it
but
i
ai
sure
i
like
this
sort
o
thing
always
think
o
the
money
you
make
in
a
side
show
said
joe
with
his
funny
chuckling
laugh
then
he
pounded
his
wooden
leg
against
the
hard
floor
and
managed
to
hobble
from
the
room
without
more
accidents
when
he
had
gone
trot
said
are
you
glad
to
find
your
brother
again
bill
why
replied
the
sailor
i
do
know
much
about
joe
seein
as
we
have
met
before
for
many
a
long
year
an
all
i
remember
about
our
boyhood
days
is
that
we
fit
an
pulled
hair
most
o
the
time
but
what
worries
me
most
is
joe
lookin
so
much
like
me
myself
wooden
leg
an
all
do
you
think
it
rather
cheeky
an
unbrotherly
trot
perhaps
he
ca
help
it
suggested
the
child
and
anyhow
never
be
able
to
live
on
land
again
no
said
bill
with
a
sigh
joe
a
fish
now
an
so
he
ai
likely
to
be
took
for
me
by
one
of
our
friends
on
the
earth
chapter
the
magic
of
the
mermaids
when
trot
and
bill
entered
the
rose
chamber
they
found
the
two
mermaids
reclining
before
an
air
fountain
that
was
sending
thousands
of
tiny
bubbles
up
through
the
water
these
fountains
of
air
are
excellent
things
remarked
queen
aquareine
for
they
keep
the
water
fresh
and
sweet
and
that
is
the
more
necessary
when
it
is
confined
by
walls
as
it
is
in
this
castle
but
now
let
us
counsel
together
and
decide
what
to
do
in
the
emergency
that
confronts
us
how
can
we
tell
what
to
do
without
knowing
what
going
to
happen
asked
trot
somethin
sure
to
happen
said
bill
as
if
to
prove
his
words
a
gong
suddenly
sounded
at
their
door
and
in
walked
a
fat
little
man
clothed
all
in
white
including
a
white
apron
and
white
cap
his
face
was
round
and
jolly
and
he
had
a
big
mustache
that
curled
up
at
the
ends
well
well
said
the
little
man
spreading
out
his
legs
and
putting
his
hands
on
his
hips
as
he
stood
looking
at
them
of
all
the
queer
things
in
the
sea
you
the
queerest
mermaids
eh
do
bunch
us
that
way
protested
bill
you
are
quite
wrong
said
trot
i
a
a
girl
with
a
fish
tail
he
asked
laughing
at
her
that
only
just
for
a
while
she
said
while
i
in
the
water
you
know
when
i
at
home
on
the
land
i
walk
just
as
you
do
an
so
does
bill
but
we
have
any
gills
remarked
the
looking
closely
at
the
little
man
throat
so
i
take
it
we
not
as
fishy
as
some
others
if
you
mean
me
i
must
admit
you
are
right
said
the
little
man
twisting
his
mustache
i
as
near
a
fish
as
a
man
can
be
but
you
see
without
the
gills
that
make
me
a
fish
i
could
not
live
under
water
when
it
comes
to
that
you
no
business
to
live
under
water
asserted
the
sailor
but
i
you
a
slave
and
ca
help
it
i
chief
cook
for
that
old
horror
zog
and
that
reminds
me
good
mermaids
or
good
people
or
good
girls
and
sailors
or
whatever
you
are
that
i
sent
here
to
ask
what
you
like
to
eat
good
to
see
you
sir
said
bill
i
nearly
starved
myself
i
had
it
in
mind
said
the
little
man
to
prepare
a
regular
mermaid
dinner
but
since
you
not
mermaids
oh
two
of
us
are
said
the
queen
smiling
i
my
good
cook
am
aquareine
the
ruler
of
the
mermaids
and
this
is
the
princess
clia
i
often
heard
of
you
your
majesty
returned
the
chief
cook
bowing
respectfully
and
i
must
say
i
heard
only
good
of
you
now
that
you
have
unfortunately
become
my
master
prisoners
it
will
give
me
pleasure
to
serve
you
as
well
as
i
am
able
we
thank
you
good
sir
said
aquareine
what
have
you
got
to
eat
inquired
trot
seems
to
me
i
hollow
way
down
to
my
toes
my
tail
i
mean
and
it
take
a
lot
to
fill
me
up
we
have
eaten
a
morsel
since
breakfast
you
know
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
give
you
almost
anything
you
would
like
said
the
cook
zog
is
a
wonderful
magician
and
can
procure
anything
that
exists
with
no
more
effort
than
a
wiggle
of
his
thumb
but
some
eatables
you
know
are
hard
to
serve
under
water
because
they
get
so
damp
that
they
are
soon
ruined
ah
it
is
different
with
the
mermaids
said
princess
clia
yes
all
your
things
are
kept
dry
because
they
are
surrounded
by
air
i
heard
how
the
mermaids
live
but
here
it
is
different
take
this
ring
said
the
queen
handing
the
chief
cook
a
circlet
which
she
drew
from
her
finger
while
it
is
in
your
possession
the
food
you
prepare
will
not
get
wet
or
even
moist
i
thank
your
majesty
returned
the
cook
taking
the
ring
my
name
is
tom
atto
and
i
do
my
best
to
please
you
how
would
you
like
for
luncheon
some
oysters
on
the
clam
broth
shrimp
salad
broiled
turtle
steak
and
watermelon
that
will
do
very
nicely
answered
the
queen
do
watermelons
grow
in
the
sea
asked
trot
of
course
that
is
why
they
are
called
watermelons
replied
tom
atto
i
think
i
shall
serve
you
a
water
ice
in
addition
to
the
rest
water
ice
is
an
appropriate
sea
food
have
some
watercress
with
the
salad
said
bill
i
thought
of
that
declared
the
cook
does
my
bill
of
fare
make
your
mouths
water
hurry
up
and
get
it
ready
suggested
trot
tom
atto
at
once
bowed
and
retired
and
when
they
were
done
bill
said
to
the
queen
do
you
think
we
can
manage
to
escape
from
zog
and
his
castle
i
hope
we
shall
find
a
way
replied
aquareine
the
evil
powers
of
magic
which
zog
controls
may
not
prove
to
be
as
strong
as
the
fairy
powers
i
possess
but
of
course
i
can
not
be
positive
until
i
discover
what
this
wicked
magician
is
able
to
do
princess
clia
was
looking
out
of
one
of
the
windows
i
think
i
can
see
an
opening
far
up
in
the
top
of
the
dome
she
said
they
all
hastened
to
the
windows
to
look
and
although
trot
and
bill
could
see
nothing
but
a
solid
dome
above
the
castle
perhaps
because
it
was
so
far
away
from
them
the
sharp
eyes
of
aquareine
were
not
to
be
deceived
yes
she
announced
there
is
surely
an
opening
in
the
center
of
the
great
dome
a
little
thought
must
convince
us
that
such
an
opening
is
bound
to
exist
for
otherwise
the
water
confined
within
the
dome
would
not
be
fresh
or
clear
then
if
we
could
escape
from
this
castle
we
could
swim
up
to
the
hole
in
the
dome
and
get
free
exclaimed
trot
why
zog
has
probably
ordered
the
opening
well
guarded
as
he
has
all
the
other
outlets
responded
the
queen
yet
it
may
be
worth
while
for
us
to
make
the
attempt
to
get
back
into
the
broad
ocean
this
way
the
night
would
be
the
best
time
when
all
are
asleep
and
surely
it
will
be
quicker
to
reach
the
ocean
through
this
hole
in
the
roof
than
by
means
of
the
long
winding
passages
by
which
we
entered
but
we
will
have
to
break
out
of
the
castle
in
some
way
observed
bill
that
will
not
be
difficult
answered
aquareine
it
will
be
no
trouble
for
me
to
shatter
one
of
these
panes
of
glass
allowing
us
to
pass
out
and
swim
straight
up
to
the
top
of
the
dome
let
do
it
now
said
trot
eagerly
no
my
dear
we
must
wait
for
a
good
opportunity
when
we
are
not
watched
closely
we
do
not
wish
the
terrible
zog
to
thwart
our
plan
answered
the
queen
gently
presently
two
sailor
boys
entered
bearing
trays
of
food
which
they
placed
upon
a
large
table
they
were
young
fellows
with
gills
at
their
throats
but
had
laughing
eyes
and
trot
was
astonished
not
to
find
any
of
the
slaves
of
zog
weeping
or
miserable
instead
they
were
as
jolly
and
as
could
be
and
seemed
to
like
their
life
under
the
water
bill
asked
one
of
the
boys
how
many
slaves
were
in
the
castle
and
the
youth
replied
that
he
would
try
to
count
them
and
let
him
know
tom
atto
had
they
found
prepared
for
them
an
excellent
meal
and
they
ate
heartily
because
they
were
really
hungry
after
luncheon
bill
smoked
his
pipe
contentedly
and
they
renewed
their
conversation
planning
various
ways
to
outwit
zog
and
make
their
escape
while
thus
engaged
the
gong
at
the
door
sounded
and
sacho
entered
my
diabolical
master
commands
you
to
attend
him
said
the
boy
when
asked
aquareine
at
once
your
majesty
very
well
we
will
follow
you
she
said
so
they
swam
down
the
corridors
following
sacho
until
they
again
reached
the
room
they
had
formerly
visited
here
sat
zog
just
as
they
had
left
him
seemingly
but
when
his
prisoners
entered
the
magician
arose
and
stood
upon
his
cloven
feet
and
then
silently
walked
to
a
curtained
archway
sacho
commanded
the
prisoners
to
follow
and
beyond
the
archway
they
found
a
vast
chamber
that
occupied
the
center
of
the
castle
and
was
as
big
as
a
ballroom
zog
who
seemed
to
walk
with
much
difficulty
because
his
ungainly
body
swayed
back
and
forth
did
not
go
far
beyond
the
arched
entrance
a
golden
throne
was
set
nearby
and
in
this
the
monster
seated
himself
at
one
side
of
the
throne
stood
a
group
of
slaves
they
were
men
women
and
children
all
had
broad
gold
bands
clasped
around
their
ankles
as
a
badge
of
servitude
and
at
each
throat
were
the
fish
gills
that
enabled
them
to
breathe
and
live
under
water
yet
every
face
was
smiling
and
serene
even
in
the
presence
of
their
dread
master
in
parts
of
the
big
hall
were
groups
of
other
slaves
sacho
ranged
the
prisoners
in
a
circle
before
zog
throne
and
slowly
the
magician
turned
his
eyes
glowing
like
live
coals
upon
the
four
captives
said
he
speaking
in
his
clear
sweet
voice
in
our
first
interview
you
defied
me
and
both
the
mermaid
queen
and
the
princess
declared
they
could
not
die
but
if
that
is
a
true
statement
as
i
have
yet
to
discover
there
are
various
ways
to
make
you
miserable
and
unhappy
and
this
i
propose
to
do
in
order
to
amuse
myself
at
your
expense
you
have
been
brought
here
to
undergo
the
first
trial
of
strength
between
us
none
of
the
prisoners
replied
to
this
speech
so
zog
turned
to
one
of
his
slaves
and
said
rivivi
bring
in
the
rivivi
was
a
big
fellow
brown
of
skin
and
with
flashing
black
eyes
he
bowed
to
his
master
and
left
the
room
by
an
archway
covered
with
heavy
draperies
the
next
moment
these
curtains
were
violently
pushed
aside
and
a
dreadful
sea
creature
swam
into
the
hall
it
had
a
body
much
like
that
of
a
crab
only
more
round
and
of
a
color
its
eyes
were
bright
yellow
balls
set
on
the
ends
of
two
horns
that
stuck
out
of
its
head
they
were
eyes
too
and
seemed
able
to
see
every
person
in
the
room
at
the
same
time
the
legs
of
the
however
were
the
most
curious
part
of
the
creature
there
were
six
of
them
slender
and
black
as
coal
and
each
extended
twelve
to
fifteen
feet
from
its
body
when
stretched
out
in
a
straight
line
they
were
hinged
in
several
places
so
they
could
be
folded
up
or
extended
at
will
at
the
ends
of
these
thin
legs
were
immense
claws
shaped
like
those
of
a
lobster
and
they
were
real
nippers
of
a
most
dangerous
sort
the
prisoners
knew
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
awful
claws
why
the
thing
was
called
the
and
trot
gave
a
little
shiver
and
crept
closer
to
bill
zog
looked
with
approval
upon
the
creature
he
had
summoned
and
said
to
it
i
give
you
four
victims
the
four
people
with
fish
tails
let
me
hear
how
loud
they
can
yell
the
uttered
a
grunt
of
pleasure
and
in
a
flash
stretched
out
one
of
its
long
legs
toward
the
queen
nose
where
its
powerful
claws
came
together
with
a
loud
noise
aquareine
did
not
stir
she
only
smiled
both
zog
and
the
creature
that
had
attacked
her
seemed
much
surprised
to
find
she
was
unhurt
again
cried
zog
and
again
the
claw
shot
out
and
tried
to
pinch
the
queen
pretty
ear
but
the
magic
of
the
fairy
mermaid
was
proof
against
this
strength
and
swiftness
nor
could
he
touch
any
part
of
aquareine
although
he
tried
again
and
again
roaring
with
anger
like
a
mad
bull
trot
began
to
enjoy
this
performance
and
as
her
merry
childish
laughter
rang
out
the
turned
furiously
upon
the
little
girl
two
of
the
dreadful
claws
trying
to
nip
her
at
the
same
time
she
had
no
chance
to
cry
out
or
jump
backward
yet
she
remained
unharmed
for
the
fairy
circle
of
queen
aquareine
kept
her
safe
now
bill
was
attacked
and
princess
clia
as
well
the
slender
legs
darted
in
every
direction
like
sword
thrusts
to
reach
their
victims
and
the
cruel
claws
snapped
so
rapidly
that
the
sound
was
like
the
rattling
of
castanets
but
the
four
prisoners
regarded
their
enemy
with
smiling
composure
and
no
yell
greeted
the
efforts
enough
said
zog
softly
and
sweetly
you
may
retire
my
poor
for
with
these
people
you
are
powerless
the
creature
paused
and
rolled
its
yellow
eyes
may
i
nip
just
one
of
the
slaves
oh
zog
it
asked
pleadingly
i
hate
to
leave
without
pleasing
your
ears
with
a
single
yell
let
my
slaves
alone
was
zog
answer
they
are
here
to
serve
me
and
must
not
be
injured
go
feeble
one
not
so
cried
the
queen
it
is
a
shame
zog
that
such
an
evil
thing
should
exist
in
our
fair
sea
with
this
she
drew
her
fairy
wand
from
a
fold
of
her
gown
and
waved
it
toward
the
creature
at
once
the
sank
down
unconscious
upon
the
floor
its
legs
fell
apart
in
many
pieces
the
claws
tumbling
in
a
heap
beside
the
body
then
all
grew
withered
and
lost
shape
becoming
a
pulpy
mass
like
gelatin
a
few
moments
later
the
creature
had
melted
away
to
nothing
at
all
forever
disappearing
from
the
ocean
where
it
had
caused
so
much
horror
and
pain
zog
watched
this
destruction
with
surprising
patience
when
it
was
all
over
he
nodded
his
head
and
smiled
and
trot
noticed
that
whenever
zog
smiled
his
slaves
lost
their
jolly
looks
and
began
to
tremble
that
is
very
pretty
magic
aquareine
said
the
monster
i
myself
learned
the
trick
several
thousand
years
ago
so
it
does
not
astonish
me
have
you
fairies
nothing
that
is
new
to
show
me
we
desire
only
to
protect
ourselves
replied
the
queen
with
dignity
then
i
will
give
you
a
chance
to
do
so
said
zog
as
he
spoke
the
great
marble
blocks
in
the
ceiling
of
the
room
directly
over
the
heads
of
the
captives
gave
way
and
came
crashing
down
upon
them
many
tons
of
weight
were
in
these
marble
blocks
and
the
magician
had
planned
to
crush
his
victims
where
they
stood
but
the
four
were
still
unharmed
the
marble
being
unable
to
touch
them
was
diverted
from
its
course
and
when
the
roar
of
the
great
crash
had
died
away
zog
saw
his
intended
victims
standing
quietly
in
their
places
and
smiling
scornfully
at
his
weak
attempts
to
destroy
them
chapter
the
top
of
the
great
dome
bill
heart
was
beating
pretty
vast
but
he
did
not
let
zog
know
that
trot
was
so
sure
of
the
protection
of
the
fairy
mermaids
that
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
become
frightened
aquareine
and
clia
were
as
calm
as
if
nothing
had
happened
please
excuse
this
little
interruption
said
zog
i
knew
very
well
the
marble
blocks
would
not
hurt
you
but
the
play
is
over
for
a
time
you
may
now
retire
to
your
rooms
and
when
i
again
invite
you
to
my
presence
i
shall
have
found
some
better
ways
to
entertain
you
without
reply
to
this
threat
they
turned
and
followed
sacho
from
the
hall
and
the
boy
led
them
straight
back
to
their
own
rooms
zog
is
making
a
great
mistake
said
sacho
with
a
laugh
he
has
no
time
for
vengeance
but
the
great
magician
does
not
know
that
what
is
he
trying
to
do
anyway
asked
trot
he
does
not
tell
me
all
his
secrets
but
i
an
idea
he
wants
to
kill
you
replied
sacho
how
absurd
it
is
to
be
plotting
such
a
thing
when
he
might
spend
his
time
in
laughing
and
being
jolly
is
it
now
zog
is
a
wicked
wicked
creature
exclaimed
trot
but
he
had
his
good
points
replied
sacho
cheerfully
there
is
no
one
about
in
the
world
so
bad
that
there
is
nothing
good
about
him
i
not
so
sure
of
that
said
bill
what
are
zog
good
points
all
his
slaves
were
saved
from
drowning
and
he
is
kind
to
them
said
sacho
that
is
merely
the
kindness
of
selfishness
said
aquareine
tell
me
my
lad
is
the
opening
in
the
great
dome
outside
guarded
yes
indeed
was
the
reply
you
can
not
hope
to
escape
in
that
way
for
the
prince
of
the
sea
devils
who
is
the
largest
and
fiercest
of
his
race
lies
crouched
over
the
opening
night
and
day
and
none
can
pass
his
network
of
curling
legs
is
there
no
avenue
that
is
not
guarded
continued
aquareine
none
at
all
your
majesty
zog
is
always
careful
to
be
well
guarded
for
he
fears
the
approach
of
an
enemy
what
this
enemy
can
be
to
terrify
the
great
magician
i
do
not
know
but
zog
is
always
afraid
and
never
leaves
an
entrance
unguarded
besides
it
is
an
enchanted
castle
you
know
and
none
in
the
ocean
can
see
it
unless
zog
wishes
him
to
so
it
will
be
very
hard
for
his
enemy
to
find
him
we
wish
to
escape
said
clia
will
you
help
us
sacho
in
any
way
i
can
replied
the
boy
if
we
succeed
we
will
take
you
with
us
continued
the
princess
but
sacho
shook
his
head
and
laughed
i
would
indeed
like
to
see
you
escape
zog
vengeance
said
he
for
vengeance
is
wrong
and
you
are
too
pretty
and
too
good
to
be
destroyed
but
i
am
happy
here
and
have
no
wish
to
go
away
having
no
other
home
or
friends
other
than
my
fellow
slaves
then
he
left
them
and
when
they
were
again
alone
aquareine
said
we
were
able
to
escape
zog
attacks
today
but
i
am
quite
sure
he
will
plan
more
powerful
ways
to
destroy
us
he
has
shown
that
he
knows
some
clever
magic
and
perhaps
i
shall
not
be
able
to
foil
it
so
it
will
be
well
for
us
to
escape
tonight
if
possible
can
you
fight
and
conquer
the
big
sea
devil
up
in
the
dome
asked
trot
the
queen
was
thoughtful
and
did
not
reply
to
this
question
at
once
but
bill
said
uneasily
i
ca
abide
them
devil
critters
an
i
hopes
for
my
part
we
wo
be
called
on
to
tackle
you
see
trot
we
in
of
a
bad
mess
an
if
we
ever
live
to
tell
the
tale
why
not
asked
the
child
we
safe
enough
so
far
you
trust
our
good
friend
the
queen
she
do
seem
plumb
sure
o
things
herself
remarked
the
sailor
the
mermaids
is
all
right
an
friendly
mate
but
this
magic
maker
ol
zog
is
a
bad
one
out
out
an
means
to
kill
us
if
he
can
but
he
ca
cried
trot
bravely
i
hope
you
right
dear
i
would
want
to
bet
on
zog
chances
jes
yet
an
at
the
same
time
it
would
be
riskin
money
to
bet
on
our
chances
seems
to
me
it
a
case
of
luck
which
wins
do
worry
friend
said
the
queen
i
have
a
plan
to
save
us
let
us
wait
patiently
until
nightfall
they
waited
in
the
rose
chamber
a
long
time
talking
earnestly
together
but
the
brilliant
light
that
flooded
both
the
room
and
the
great
dome
outside
did
not
fade
in
the
least
after
several
hours
had
passed
away
the
gong
sounded
and
tom
atto
again
appeared
followed
by
four
slaves
bearing
many
golden
dishes
upon
silver
trays
the
friendly
cook
had
prepared
a
fine
dinner
and
they
were
all
glad
to
find
that
whatever
zog
intended
to
do
to
them
he
had
no
intention
of
starving
them
perhaps
the
magician
realized
that
aquareine
fairy
powers
if
put
to
the
test
would
be
able
to
provide
food
for
her
companions
but
whatever
his
object
may
have
been
their
enemy
had
given
them
splendid
rooms
and
plenty
to
eat
is
it
nearly
nighttime
asked
the
queen
as
tom
atto
spread
the
table
with
a
cloth
of
woven
seaweed
and
directed
his
men
to
place
the
dishes
upon
it
night
he
exclaimed
as
if
surprised
there
is
no
night
here
does
it
ever
get
dark
inquired
trot
never
we
know
nothing
of
the
passage
of
time
or
of
day
or
night
the
light
always
shines
just
as
you
see
it
now
and
we
sleep
whenever
we
are
tired
and
rise
again
as
soon
as
we
are
rested
what
causes
the
light
princess
clia
asked
it
magic
your
highness
said
the
cook
solemnly
it
one
of
the
curious
things
zog
is
able
to
do
but
you
must
remember
all
this
place
is
a
big
cave
in
which
the
castle
stands
so
the
light
is
never
seen
by
anyone
except
those
who
live
here
but
why
does
zog
keep
his
light
going
all
the
time
asked
the
queen
i
suppose
it
is
because
he
himself
never
sleeps
replied
tom
atto
they
say
the
master
has
slept
for
hundreds
of
years
not
since
anko
the
sea
serpent
defeated
him
and
drove
him
into
this
place
they
asked
no
more
questions
and
began
to
eat
their
dinner
in
silence
before
long
joe
came
in
to
visit
his
brother
and
took
a
seat
at
the
table
with
the
prisoners
he
proved
a
jolly
fellow
and
when
he
and
bill
talked
about
their
boyhood
days
the
stories
were
so
funny
that
everybody
laughed
and
for
a
time
forgot
their
worries
when
dinner
was
over
however
and
joe
had
gone
back
to
his
work
of
sewing
on
buttons
and
the
servants
had
carried
away
the
dishes
the
prisoners
remembered
their
troubles
and
the
fate
that
awaited
them
i
am
much
disappointed
said
the
queen
to
find
there
is
no
night
here
and
that
zog
never
sleeps
it
will
make
our
escape
more
difficult
yet
we
must
make
the
attempt
and
as
we
are
tired
and
a
great
struggle
is
before
us
it
will
be
best
for
us
to
sleep
and
refresh
ourselves
they
agreed
to
this
for
the
day
had
been
long
and
adventurous
so
bill
kissed
trot
and
went
in
to
the
peony
room
where
he
lay
down
upon
his
spongy
couch
and
fell
fast
asleep
the
mermaids
and
trot
followed
this
example
and
i
think
none
of
them
was
much
worried
after
all
because
they
quickly
sank
into
peaceful
slumber
and
forgot
all
the
dangers
that
threatened
them
chapter
the
queen
golden
sword
goodness
me
exclaimed
trot
raising
herself
by
a
flirt
of
her
tail
and
a
wave
of
her
fins
is
it
dreadful
hot
here
the
mermaids
had
risen
at
the
same
time
and
bill
came
swimming
in
from
the
peony
room
in
time
to
hear
the
little
speech
hot
echoed
the
sailor
why
i
feel
like
the
inside
of
a
steam
engine
the
perspiration
was
rolling
down
his
round
red
face
and
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
carefully
wiped
it
away
waving
his
fish
tail
gently
at
the
same
time
what
we
need
most
in
this
room
said
he
is
a
fan
what
the
trouble
do
you
inquired
trot
it
is
another
trick
of
the
monster
zog
answered
the
queen
calmly
he
has
made
the
water
in
our
rooms
boiling
hot
and
if
it
could
touch
us
we
would
be
well
cooked
by
this
time
even
as
it
is
we
are
all
made
uncomfortable
by
breathing
the
heated
air
what
shall
we
do
the
sailor
man
asked
with
a
groan
i
expected
to
get
into
hot
water
afore
we
done
with
this
foolishness
but
i
do
like
the
feel
o
bein
parboiled
jes
the
same
the
queen
was
waving
her
fairy
wand
and
paid
no
attention
to
bill
moans
already
the
water
felt
cooler
and
they
began
to
breathe
more
easily
in
a
few
moments
more
the
heat
had
passed
from
the
surrounding
water
altogether
and
all
danger
from
this
source
was
over
this
is
better
said
trot
gratefully
do
you
care
to
sleep
again
asked
the
queen
no
i
wide
awake
now
answered
the
child
i
afraid
if
i
goes
to
sleep
i
wake
up
a
pot
roast
said
bill
let
us
consider
ways
to
escape
suggested
clia
it
seems
useless
for
us
to
remain
here
quietly
until
zog
discovers
a
way
to
destroy
us
but
we
must
not
blunder
added
aquareine
cautiously
to
fail
in
our
attempt
would
be
to
acknowledge
zog
superior
power
so
we
must
think
well
upon
our
plan
before
we
begin
to
carry
it
out
what
do
you
advise
sir
she
asked
turning
to
bill
my
opinion
is
that
the
only
way
for
us
to
escape
is
to
get
out
o
here
was
the
sailor
vague
answer
how
to
do
it
is
your
business
seein
as
i
ai
no
fairy
myself
either
in
looks
or
in
eddication
the
queen
smiled
and
said
to
trot
what
is
your
opinion
my
dear
i
think
we
might
swim
out
the
same
way
we
came
in
answered
the
child
if
we
could
get
sacho
to
lead
us
back
through
the
maze
we
would
follow
that
long
tunnel
to
the
open
ocean
and
and
there
would
be
the
sea
devils
waitin
for
us
added
bill
with
a
shake
of
his
bald
head
they
drive
us
back
inter
the
tunnel
like
they
did
the
first
time
trot
it
wo
do
mate
it
wo
do
have
you
a
suggestion
clia
inquired
the
queen
i
have
thought
of
an
undertaking
replied
the
pretty
princess
but
it
is
a
bold
plan
your
majesty
and
you
may
not
care
to
risk
it
let
us
hear
it
anyway
said
aquareine
encouragingly
it
is
to
destroy
zog
himself
and
put
him
out
of
the
world
forever
then
we
would
be
free
to
go
home
whenever
we
pleased
can
you
suggest
a
way
to
destroy
zog
asked
aquareine
no
your
majesty
clia
answered
i
must
leave
the
way
for
you
to
determine
in
the
old
days
said
the
queen
thoughtfully
the
mighty
king
anko
could
not
destroy
this
monster
he
succeeded
in
defeating
zog
and
drove
him
into
this
great
cavern
but
even
anko
could
not
destroy
him
i
have
heard
the
sea
serpent
explain
that
it
was
because
he
could
not
reach
the
magician
returned
clia
if
king
anko
could
have
seized
zog
in
his
coils
he
would
have
made
an
end
of
the
wicked
monster
quickly
zog
knows
this
and
that
is
why
he
does
not
venture
forth
from
his
retreat
anko
is
the
enemy
he
constantly
dreads
but
with
you
my
queen
the
case
is
different
you
may
easily
reach
zog
and
the
only
question
is
whether
your
power
is
sufficient
to
destroy
him
for
a
while
aquareine
remained
silent
i
am
not
sure
of
my
power
over
him
she
said
at
last
and
for
that
reason
i
hesitate
to
attack
him
personally
his
slaves
and
his
allies
the
sea
devils
i
can
easily
conquer
so
i
prefer
to
find
a
way
to
overcome
the
guards
at
the
entrances
rather
than
to
encounter
their
terrible
master
but
even
the
guards
have
been
given
strength
and
power
by
the
magician
as
we
have
already
discovered
so
i
must
procure
a
weapon
with
which
to
fight
them
a
weapon
said
bill
and
then
he
took
a
jackknife
from
his
coat
pocket
and
opened
the
big
blade
afterward
handing
it
to
the
queen
that
ai
a
bad
weapon
he
announced
but
it
is
useless
in
this
case
she
replied
smiling
at
the
old
sailor
earnestness
for
my
purpose
i
must
have
a
golden
sword
well
there
plenty
of
gold
around
this
castle
said
trot
looking
around
her
even
in
this
room
there
enough
to
make
a
hundred
golden
swords
but
we
ca
melt
or
forge
gold
under
water
mate
the
said
why
not
do
you
all
these
gold
roses
and
things
were
made
under
water
asked
the
little
girl
like
enough
remarked
the
sailor
but
i
do
see
how
just
then
the
gong
at
the
door
sounded
and
the
boy
sacho
came
in
smiling
and
cheerful
as
ever
he
said
zog
had
sent
him
to
inquire
after
their
health
and
happiness
you
may
tell
him
that
his
water
became
a
trifle
too
warm
so
we
cooled
it
replied
the
queen
then
they
told
sacho
how
the
boiling
water
had
made
them
uncomfortable
while
they
slept
sacho
whistled
a
little
tune
and
seemed
thoughtful
zog
is
foolish
said
he
how
often
have
i
told
him
that
vengeance
is
a
waste
of
time
he
is
worried
to
know
how
to
destroy
you
and
that
is
wasting
more
time
you
are
worried
for
fear
he
will
injure
you
and
so
you
also
are
wasting
time
my
my
what
a
waste
of
time
is
going
on
in
this
castle
seems
to
me
that
we
have
so
much
time
it
does
matter
said
trot
what
time
for
anyhow
time
is
given
us
to
be
happy
and
for
no
other
reason
replied
the
boy
soberly
when
we
waste
time
we
waste
happiness
but
there
is
no
time
for
preaching
so
i
go
please
wait
a
moment
sacho
said
the
queen
can
i
do
anything
to
make
you
happy
he
asked
smiling
again
yes
answered
aquareine
we
are
curious
to
know
who
does
all
this
beautiful
gold
work
and
ornamentation
some
of
the
slaves
here
are
goldsmiths
having
been
taught
by
zog
to
forge
and
work
metal
under
water
explained
sacho
in
parts
of
the
ocean
lie
many
rocks
filled
with
veins
of
pure
gold
and
golden
nuggets
and
we
get
large
supplies
from
sunken
ships
as
well
there
is
no
lack
of
gold
here
but
it
is
not
as
precious
as
it
is
upon
the
earth
because
here
we
have
no
need
of
money
we
would
like
to
see
the
goldsmiths
at
work
announced
the
queen
the
boy
hesitated
a
moment
then
he
said
i
will
take
you
to
their
room
where
you
may
watch
them
for
a
time
i
will
not
ask
permission
to
do
this
for
he
might
refuse
but
my
orders
were
to
allow
you
the
liberty
of
the
castle
and
so
i
will
let
you
see
the
goldsmiths
shop
thank
you
replied
aquareine
quietly
and
then
the
four
followed
sacho
along
various
corridors
until
they
came
to
a
large
room
where
a
dozen
men
were
busily
at
work
lying
here
and
there
were
heaps
of
virgin
gold
some
in
its
natural
state
and
some
already
fashioned
into
ornaments
and
furniture
of
various
sorts
each
man
worked
at
a
bench
where
there
was
a
curious
iron
furnace
in
which
glowed
a
vivid
white
light
although
this
workshop
was
all
under
water
and
the
workmen
were
all
obliged
to
breathe
as
fishes
do
the
furnaces
glowed
so
hot
that
the
water
touching
them
was
turned
into
steam
gold
or
other
metal
held
over
a
furnace
quickly
softened
or
melted
when
it
could
be
forged
or
molded
into
any
shape
desired
the
furnaces
are
electric
explained
sacho
and
heat
as
well
under
water
as
they
would
in
the
open
air
let
me
introduce
you
to
the
foreman
who
will
tell
you
of
his
work
better
than
i
can
the
foreman
was
a
slave
named
who
was
lean
and
lank
and
had
an
expression
more
surly
and
unhappy
than
any
slave
they
had
yet
seen
yet
he
seemed
willing
to
leave
his
work
and
explain
to
the
visitors
how
he
made
so
many
beautiful
things
out
of
gold
for
he
took
much
pride
in
this
labor
and
knew
its
artistic
worth
moreover
since
he
had
been
in
zog
castle
these
were
the
first
strangers
to
enter
his
workshop
so
he
welcomed
them
in
his
own
gruff
way
the
queen
asked
him
if
he
was
happy
and
he
shook
his
head
and
replied
it
is
like
calcutta
where
i
used
to
work
in
gold
before
i
was
wrecked
at
sea
and
nearly
drowned
zog
rescued
me
and
brought
me
here
a
slave
it
is
a
stupid
life
we
lead
doing
the
same
things
over
and
over
every
day
but
perhaps
it
is
better
than
being
dead
i
not
sure
the
only
pleasure
i
get
in
life
is
in
creating
pretty
things
out
of
gold
could
you
forge
me
a
golden
sword
asked
the
queen
smiling
sweetly
upon
the
goldsmith
i
could
madam
but
i
wo
unless
zog
orders
me
to
do
it
do
you
like
zog
better
than
you
do
me
inquired
aquareine
no
was
the
answer
i
hate
zog
then
wo
you
make
the
sword
to
please
me
and
to
show
your
skill
pleaded
the
pretty
mermaid
i
afraid
of
my
master
he
might
not
like
it
the
man
replied
but
he
will
never
know
said
princess
clia
you
can
not
say
what
zog
knows
or
what
he
does
know
growled
the
man
i
ca
take
chances
of
offending
zog
for
i
must
live
with
him
always
as
a
slave
with
this
he
turned
away
and
resumed
his
work
hammering
the
leaf
of
a
golden
ship
bill
had
listened
carefully
to
this
conversation
and
being
a
wise
old
sailor
in
his
way
he
thought
he
understood
the
nature
of
old
better
than
the
mermaids
did
so
he
went
close
to
the
goldsmith
and
feeling
in
the
pockets
of
his
coat
drew
out
a
silver
compass
shaped
like
a
watch
i
give
you
this
if
you
make
the
queen
the
golden
sword
he
said
looked
at
the
compass
with
interest
and
tested
its
power
of
pointing
north
then
he
shook
his
head
and
handed
it
back
to
bill
the
sailor
dived
into
his
pocket
again
and
pulled
out
a
pair
of
scissors
which
he
placed
beside
the
compass
on
the
palm
of
his
big
hand
you
may
have
them
both
he
said
hesitated
for
he
wanted
the
scissors
badly
but
finally
he
shook
his
head
again
bill
added
a
piece
of
cord
an
iron
thimble
some
fishhooks
four
buttons
and
a
safety
pin
but
still
the
goldsmith
would
not
be
tempted
so
with
a
sigh
the
sailor
brought
out
his
fine
big
jackknife
and
at
sight
of
this
eyes
began
to
sparkle
steel
was
not
to
be
had
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
although
gold
was
so
plentiful
all
right
friend
he
said
give
me
that
lot
of
trinkets
and
i
make
you
a
pretty
gold
sword
but
it
wo
be
any
good
except
to
look
at
for
our
gold
is
so
pure
that
it
is
very
soft
never
mind
that
replied
bill
all
we
want
is
the
sword
the
goldsmith
set
to
work
at
once
and
so
skillful
was
he
that
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
forged
a
fine
sword
of
yellow
gold
with
an
ornamental
handle
the
shape
was
graceful
and
the
blade
keen
and
slender
it
was
evident
to
them
all
that
the
golden
sword
would
not
stand
hard
use
for
the
edge
of
the
blade
would
nick
and
curl
like
lead
but
the
queen
was
delighted
with
the
prize
and
took
it
eagerly
in
her
hand
just
then
sacho
returned
to
say
that
they
must
go
back
to
their
rooms
and
after
thanking
the
goldsmith
who
was
so
busy
examining
his
newly
acquired
treasure
that
he
made
no
response
they
joyfully
followed
the
boy
back
to
the
rose
chamber
sacho
told
them
that
he
had
just
come
from
zog
who
was
still
wasting
time
in
plotting
vengeance
you
must
be
careful
he
advised
them
for
my
cruel
master
intends
to
stop
you
from
living
and
he
may
succeed
do
be
unhappy
but
be
careful
zog
is
angry
because
you
escaped
his
and
the
falling
stones
and
the
hot
water
while
he
is
angry
he
is
wasting
time
but
that
will
not
help
you
take
care
not
to
waste
any
time
yourselves
do
you
know
what
zog
intends
to
do
to
us
next
asked
princess
clia
no
said
sacho
but
it
is
reasonable
to
guess
that
being
evil
he
intends
evil
he
never
intends
to
do
good
i
assure
you
then
the
boy
went
away
i
am
no
longer
afraid
declared
the
mermaid
queen
when
they
were
alone
when
i
have
bestowed
certain
fairy
powers
upon
this
golden
sword
it
will
fight
its
way
against
any
who
dare
oppose
us
and
even
zog
himself
will
not
care
to
face
so
powerful
a
weapon
i
am
now
able
to
promise
you
that
we
shall
make
our
escape
good
cried
trot
joyfully
shall
we
start
now
not
yet
my
dear
it
will
take
me
a
little
while
to
charm
this
golden
blade
so
that
it
will
obey
my
commands
and
do
my
work
there
is
no
need
of
undue
haste
so
i
propose
we
all
sleep
for
a
time
and
obtain
what
rest
we
can
we
must
be
fresh
and
ready
for
our
great
adventure
as
their
former
nap
had
been
interrupted
they
readily
agreed
to
aquareine
proposal
and
at
once
went
to
their
couches
and
composed
themselves
to
slumber
when
they
were
asleep
the
fairy
mermaid
charmed
her
golden
sword
and
then
she
also
lay
down
to
rest
herself
chapter
a
dash
for
liberty
trot
dreamed
that
she
was
at
home
in
her
own
bed
but
the
night
seemed
chilly
and
she
wanted
to
draw
the
coverlet
up
to
her
chin
she
was
not
wide
awake
but
realized
that
she
was
cold
and
unable
to
move
her
arms
to
cover
herself
up
she
tried
but
could
not
stir
then
she
roused
herself
a
little
more
and
tried
again
yes
it
was
cold
very
cold
really
she
must
do
something
to
get
warm
she
thought
she
opened
her
eyes
and
stared
at
a
great
wall
of
ice
in
front
of
her
she
was
awake
now
and
frightened
too
but
she
could
not
move
because
the
ice
was
all
around
her
she
was
frozen
inside
of
it
and
the
air
space
around
her
was
not
big
enough
to
allow
her
to
turn
over
at
once
the
little
girl
realized
what
had
happened
their
wicked
enemy
zog
had
by
his
magic
art
frozen
all
the
water
in
their
room
while
they
slept
and
now
they
were
all
imprisoned
and
helpless
trot
and
bill
were
sure
to
freeze
to
death
in
a
short
time
for
only
a
tiny
air
space
remained
between
their
bodies
and
the
ice
and
this
air
was
like
that
of
a
winter
day
when
the
thermometer
is
below
zero
across
the
room
trot
could
see
the
mermaid
queen
lying
on
her
couch
for
the
solid
ice
was
clear
as
crystal
aquareine
was
imprisoned
just
as
trot
was
and
although
she
held
her
fairy
wand
in
one
hand
and
the
golden
sword
in
the
other
she
seemed
unable
to
move
either
of
them
and
the
girl
remembered
that
the
queen
always
waved
her
magic
wand
to
accomplish
anything
princess
clia
couch
was
behind
that
of
trot
so
the
child
could
not
see
her
and
bill
was
in
his
own
room
probably
frozen
fast
in
the
ice
as
the
others
were
the
terrible
zog
has
surely
been
very
clever
in
this
last
attempt
to
destroy
them
trot
thought
it
all
over
and
she
decided
that
inasmuch
as
the
queen
was
unable
to
wave
her
fairy
wand
she
could
do
nothing
to
release
herself
or
her
friends
but
in
this
the
girl
was
mistaken
the
fairy
mermaid
was
even
now
at
work
trying
to
save
them
and
in
a
few
minutes
trot
was
astonished
and
delighted
to
see
the
queen
rise
from
her
couch
she
could
not
go
far
from
it
at
first
but
the
ice
was
melting
rapidly
all
around
her
so
that
gradually
aquareine
approached
the
place
where
the
child
lay
trot
could
hear
the
mermaid
voice
sounding
through
the
ice
as
if
from
afar
off
but
it
grew
more
distinct
until
she
could
make
out
that
the
queen
was
saying
courage
friends
do
not
despair
for
soon
you
will
be
free
before
very
long
the
ice
between
trot
and
the
queen
had
melted
away
entirely
and
with
a
cry
of
joy
the
little
girl
flopped
her
pink
tail
and
swam
to
the
side
of
her
deliverer
are
you
very
cold
asked
aquareine
replied
trot
but
her
teeth
chattered
and
she
was
still
shivering
the
water
will
be
warm
in
a
few
minutes
said
the
queen
but
now
i
must
melt
the
rest
of
the
ice
and
liberate
clia
this
she
did
in
an
astonishingly
brief
time
and
the
pretty
princess
being
herself
a
fairy
had
not
been
at
all
affected
by
the
cold
surrounding
her
they
now
swam
to
the
door
of
bill
room
and
found
the
peony
chamber
a
solid
block
of
ice
the
queen
worked
her
magic
power
as
hard
as
she
could
and
the
ice
flowed
and
melted
quickly
before
her
fairy
wand
yet
when
they
reached
the
old
sailor
he
was
almost
frozen
stiff
and
trot
and
clia
had
to
rub
his
hands
and
nose
and
ears
very
briskly
to
warm
him
up
and
bring
him
back
to
life
bill
was
pretty
tough
and
he
came
around
in
time
and
opened
his
eyes
and
sneezed
and
asked
if
the
blizzard
was
over
so
the
queen
waved
her
wand
over
his
head
a
few
times
to
restore
him
to
his
natural
condition
of
warmth
and
soon
the
old
sailor
became
quite
comfortable
and
was
able
to
understand
all
about
the
strange
adventure
from
which
he
had
so
marvelously
escaped
i
made
up
my
mind
to
one
thing
trot
he
said
confidentially
if
ever
i
get
out
o
this
mess
i
in
i
wo
be
an
arctic
explorer
whatever
else
happens
shivers
an
shakes
ai
to
my
likin
an
this
ice
business
ai
what
it
sometimes
cracked
up
to
be
to
be
friz
once
is
enough
fer
anybody
an
if
i
was
a
gal
like
you
i
would
even
wear
frizzes
on
my
hair
you
have
any
hair
bill
answered
trot
so
you
worry
the
queen
and
clia
had
been
talking
together
very
earnestly
they
now
approached
their
earth
friends
and
aquareine
said
we
have
decided
not
to
remain
in
this
castle
any
longer
cruel
designs
upon
our
lives
and
happiness
are
becoming
too
dangerous
for
us
to
endure
the
golden
sword
now
bears
a
fairy
charm
and
by
its
aid
i
will
cut
a
way
through
our
enemies
are
you
ready
and
willing
to
follow
me
of
course
we
are
cried
trot
it
do
seem
right
to
ask
a
lady
to
do
the
fightin
remarked
bill
but
magic
ai
my
strong
and
it
seems
to
be
yours
so
swim
ahead
and
we
wiggle
the
same
way
you
do
an
try
to
wiggle
out
of
our
troubles
if
i
chance
to
fail
said
the
queen
try
not
to
blame
me
i
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
provide
for
our
escape
and
i
am
willing
to
risk
everything
because
i
well
know
that
to
remain
here
will
mean
to
perish
in
the
end
that
all
right
said
trot
with
fine
courage
let
have
it
over
with
then
we
will
leave
here
at
once
said
aquareine
she
approached
the
window
of
the
room
and
with
one
blow
of
her
golden
sword
shattered
the
thick
pane
of
glass
the
opening
thus
made
was
large
enough
for
them
to
swim
through
if
they
were
careful
not
to
scrape
against
the
broken
points
of
glass
the
queen
went
first
followed
by
trot
and
bill
with
clia
last
of
all
and
now
they
were
in
the
vast
dome
in
which
the
castle
and
gardens
of
zog
had
been
built
around
them
was
a
clear
stretch
of
water
and
far
above
full
half
a
mile
distant
was
the
opening
in
the
roof
guarded
by
the
prince
of
the
sea
devils
the
mermaid
queen
had
determined
to
attack
this
monster
if
she
succeeded
in
destroying
it
with
her
golden
sword
the
little
band
of
fugitives
might
then
swim
through
the
opening
into
the
clear
waters
of
the
ocean
although
this
prince
of
the
sea
devils
was
said
to
be
big
and
wise
and
mighty
there
was
but
one
of
him
to
fight
whereas
if
they
attempted
to
escape
through
any
of
the
passages
they
must
encounter
scores
of
such
enemies
swim
straight
for
the
opening
in
the
dome
cried
aquareine
and
in
answer
to
the
command
the
four
whisked
their
glittering
tails
waved
their
fins
and
shot
away
through
the
water
at
full
speed
their
course
slanting
upward
toward
the
top
of
the
dome
chapter
king
anko
to
the
rescue
the
great
magician
zog
never
slept
he
was
always
watchful
and
alert
some
strange
power
warned
him
that
his
prisoners
were
about
to
escape
scarcely
had
the
four
left
the
castle
by
the
broken
window
when
the
monster
stepped
from
a
doorway
below
and
saw
them
instantly
he
blew
upon
a
golden
whistle
and
at
the
summons
a
band
of
appeared
and
dashed
after
the
prisoners
these
creatures
swam
so
swiftly
that
soon
they
were
between
the
fugitives
and
the
dome
and
then
they
turned
and
with
wicked
eyes
and
sharp
fangs
began
a
fierce
attack
upon
the
mermaids
and
the
earth
dwellers
trot
was
a
little
frightened
at
the
evil
looks
of
the
sea
wolves
whose
heads
were
enormous
and
whose
jaws
contained
rows
of
curved
and
pointed
teeth
but
aquareine
advanced
upon
them
with
her
golden
sword
and
every
touch
of
the
charmed
weapon
instantly
killed
an
enemy
so
that
one
by
one
the
rolled
over
upon
their
backs
and
sank
helplessly
downward
through
the
water
leaving
the
prisoners
free
to
continue
their
way
toward
the
opening
in
the
dome
zog
witnessed
the
destruction
of
his
wolves
and
uttered
a
loud
laugh
that
was
terrible
to
hear
then
the
dread
monster
determined
to
arrest
the
fugitives
himself
and
in
order
to
do
this
he
was
forced
to
discover
himself
in
all
the
horror
of
his
awful
form
a
form
he
was
so
ashamed
of
and
loathed
so
greatly
that
he
always
strove
to
keep
it
concealed
even
from
his
own
view
but
it
was
important
that
his
prisoners
should
not
escape
hastily
casting
off
the
folds
of
the
robe
that
enveloped
him
zog
allowed
his
body
to
uncoil
and
shoot
upward
through
the
water
in
swift
pursuit
of
his
victims
his
cloven
hoofs
upon
which
he
usually
walked
being
now
useless
were
drawn
up
under
him
while
coil
after
coil
of
his
body
wriggled
away
like
a
serpent
at
his
shoulders
two
broad
feathery
wings
expanded
and
these
enabled
the
monster
to
cleave
his
way
through
the
water
with
terrific
force
zog
was
part
man
part
beast
part
fish
part
fowl
and
part
reptile
his
undulating
body
was
broad
and
thin
and
like
the
body
of
an
eel
it
was
as
repulsive
as
one
could
well
imagine
and
no
wonder
zog
hated
it
and
kept
it
covered
with
his
robe
now
with
his
horned
head
and
its
glowing
eyes
thrust
forward
wings
flapping
from
his
shoulders
and
his
eely
body
ending
in
a
fish
tail
wriggling
far
behind
him
this
strange
and
evil
creature
was
a
thing
of
terror
even
to
the
sea
dwellers
who
were
accustomed
to
remarkable
sights
the
mermaids
the
sailor
and
the
child
one
after
another
looking
back
as
they
swam
toward
liberty
and
safety
saw
the
monster
coming
and
shuddered
with
uncontrollable
fear
they
were
drawing
nearer
to
the
dome
by
this
time
yet
it
was
still
some
distance
away
the
four
redoubled
their
speed
darting
through
the
water
with
the
swiftness
of
skyrockets
but
fast
as
they
swam
zog
swam
faster
and
the
good
queen
heart
began
to
throb
as
she
realized
she
would
be
forced
to
fight
her
loathesome
foe
presently
zog
long
body
was
circling
around
them
like
a
whirlwind
lashing
the
water
into
foam
and
gradually
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
his
victims
his
eyes
were
no
longer
glowing
coals
they
were
balls
of
flame
and
as
he
circled
around
them
he
laughed
aloud
that
horrible
laugh
which
was
far
more
terrifying
than
any
cry
of
rage
could
be
the
queen
struck
out
with
her
golden
sword
but
zog
wrapped
a
coil
of
his
thin
body
around
it
and
wrestling
it
from
her
hand
crushed
the
weapon
into
a
shapeless
mass
then
aquareine
waved
her
fairy
wand
but
in
a
flash
the
monster
sent
it
flying
away
through
the
water
bill
now
decided
that
they
were
lost
he
drew
trot
closer
to
his
side
and
placed
one
arm
around
her
i
ca
save
you
dear
little
mate
he
said
sadly
but
we
lived
a
long
time
together
an
now
we
die
together
i
knew
trot
when
first
we
sawr
them
mermaids
as
we
we
never
live
to
tell
the
tale
said
the
child
but
never
mind
bill
we
done
the
best
we
could
and
we
had
a
fine
time
forgive
me
oh
forgive
me
cried
aquareine
despairingly
i
tried
to
save
you
my
poor
friends
but
what
that
exclaimed
the
princess
pointing
upward
they
all
looked
past
zog
whirling
body
which
was
slowly
enveloping
them
in
its
folds
toward
the
round
opening
in
the
dome
a
dark
object
had
appeared
there
sliding
downward
like
a
huge
rope
and
descending
toward
them
with
lightning
rapidly
they
gave
a
great
gasp
as
they
recognized
the
countenance
of
king
anko
the
sea
serpent
its
gray
hair
and
whiskers
bristling
like
those
of
an
angry
cat
and
the
usually
mild
blue
eyes
glowing
with
a
ferocity
even
more
terrifying
than
the
orbs
of
zog
the
magician
gave
a
shrill
scream
at
sight
of
his
dreaded
enemy
and
abandoning
his
intended
victims
zog
made
a
quick
dash
to
escape
but
nothing
in
the
sea
could
equal
the
strength
and
quickness
of
king
anko
when
he
was
roused
in
a
flash
the
sea
serpent
had
caught
zog
fast
in
his
coils
and
his
mighty
body
swept
round
the
monster
and
imprisoned
him
tightly
the
four
so
suddenly
rescued
swam
away
to
a
safer
distance
from
the
struggle
and
then
they
turned
to
watch
the
encounter
between
the
two
great
opposing
powers
of
the
depths
yet
there
was
no
desperate
fight
to
observe
for
the
combatants
were
unequal
the
end
came
before
they
were
aware
of
it
zog
had
been
taken
by
surprise
and
his
great
fear
of
anko
destroyed
all
of
his
magic
power
when
the
sea
serpent
slowly
released
those
awful
coils
a
mass
of
pulp
floated
downward
through
the
water
with
no
remnant
of
life
remaining
in
it
no
form
to
show
it
had
once
been
zog
the
magician
then
anko
shook
his
body
that
the
water
might
cleanse
it
and
advanced
his
head
toward
the
group
of
four
whom
he
had
so
opportunely
rescued
it
is
all
over
friends
said
he
in
his
gentle
tones
while
a
mild
expression
once
more
reigned
on
his
comical
features
you
may
go
home
at
any
time
you
please
for
the
way
through
the
dome
will
be
open
as
soon
as
i
get
my
own
body
through
it
indeed
so
amazing
was
the
length
of
the
great
sea
serpent
that
only
a
part
of
him
had
descended
through
the
hole
into
the
dome
without
waiting
for
the
thanks
of
those
he
had
rescued
he
swiftly
retreated
to
the
ocean
above
and
with
grateful
hearts
they
followed
him
glad
to
leave
the
cavern
where
they
had
endured
so
much
anxiety
and
danger
chapter
the
home
of
the
ocean
monarch
trot
sobbed
quietly
with
her
head
on
bill
shoulder
she
had
been
a
brave
little
girl
during
the
trying
times
they
had
experienced
and
never
once
had
she
given
way
to
tears
however
desperate
their
fate
had
seemed
to
be
but
now
that
the
one
enemy
in
all
the
sea
to
be
dreaded
was
utterly
destroyed
and
all
dangers
were
past
the
reaction
was
so
great
that
she
could
not
help
having
just
one
good
cry
as
she
naively
expressed
it
bill
was
a
big
sailor
man
hardened
by
age
and
many
adventures
but
even
he
felt
a
lump
in
his
throat
that
he
could
not
swallow
try
as
hard
as
he
might
bill
was
glad
he
was
mostly
glad
on
trot
account
for
he
loved
his
sweet
childish
companion
very
dearly
and
did
not
want
any
harm
to
befall
her
they
were
now
in
the
wide
open
sea
with
liberty
to
go
wherever
they
wished
and
if
bill
could
have
had
his
way
he
would
have
gone
straight
home
and
carried
trot
to
her
mother
but
the
mermaids
must
be
considered
aquareine
and
clia
had
been
true
and
faithful
friends
to
their
earth
guests
while
dangers
were
threatening
and
it
would
not
be
very
gracious
to
leave
them
at
once
moreover
king
anko
was
now
with
them
his
big
head
keeping
pace
with
the
mermaids
as
they
swam
and
this
mighty
preserver
had
a
distinct
claim
upon
trot
and
bill
the
sailor
felt
that
it
would
not
be
polite
to
ask
to
go
home
so
soon
if
you
people
had
come
to
visit
me
as
i
invited
you
to
do
said
the
sea
serpent
all
this
bother
and
trouble
would
have
been
saved
i
had
my
palace
put
in
order
to
receive
the
earth
dwellers
and
sat
in
my
den
waiting
patiently
to
receive
you
yet
you
never
came
at
all
that
reminds
me
said
trot
drying
her
eyes
you
never
told
us
about
that
third
pain
you
once
had
finally
continued
anko
i
sent
to
inquire
as
to
what
had
become
of
you
and
merla
said
you
had
been
gone
from
the
palace
a
long
time
and
she
was
getting
anxious
about
you
then
i
made
inquiries
everyone
in
the
sea
loves
to
serve
me
except
those
sea
devils
and
their
cousins
the
octopi
and
it
was
long
before
i
heard
you
had
been
captured
by
zog
was
the
third
pain
as
bad
as
the
other
two
asked
trot
naturally
this
news
disturbed
me
and
made
me
unhappy
said
anko
for
i
well
knew
my
aquareine
that
the
magician
evil
powers
were
greater
than
your
own
fairy
accomplishments
but
i
had
never
been
able
to
find
zog
enchanted
castle
and
so
i
was
at
a
loss
to
know
how
to
save
you
from
your
dreadful
fate
after
i
had
wasted
a
good
deal
of
time
thinking
it
over
i
decided
that
if
the
sea
devils
were
slaves
of
zog
the
prince
of
the
sea
devils
must
know
where
the
enchanted
castle
was
located
i
knew
this
prince
and
where
to
find
him
for
he
always
lay
on
a
hollow
rock
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
never
moved
from
that
position
his
people
brought
food
to
him
and
took
his
commands
so
i
had
no
trouble
in
finding
this
evil
prince
and
i
went
to
him
and
asked
the
way
to
zog
castle
of
course
he
would
not
tell
me
he
was
even
cross
and
disrespectful
just
as
i
had
expected
him
to
be
so
i
allowed
myself
to
become
angry
and
killed
him
thinking
he
was
much
better
dead
than
alive
but
after
the
sea
devil
was
destroyed
what
was
my
surprise
to
find
that
all
these
years
he
had
been
lying
over
a
round
hole
in
the
rock
and
covering
it
with
his
scarlet
body
a
light
shone
through
this
hole
so
i
thrust
my
head
in
and
found
a
great
domed
cave
underneath
with
a
splendid
silver
castle
built
at
the
bottom
you
my
friends
were
at
that
moment
swimming
toward
me
as
fast
as
you
could
come
and
the
monster
zog
my
enemy
for
centuries
past
was
close
behind
you
well
the
rest
of
the
story
you
know
i
would
be
angry
with
all
of
you
for
so
carelessly
getting
captured
had
the
incident
not
led
to
the
destruction
of
the
one
evil
genius
in
all
my
ocean
i
shall
rest
easier
and
be
much
happier
now
that
zog
is
dead
he
has
defied
me
for
hundreds
of
years
but
about
that
third
pain
said
trot
if
you
do
tell
us
now
i
afraid
that
i
forget
to
ask
you
if
you
should
happen
to
forget
just
remind
me
of
it
said
anko
and
i
be
sure
to
tell
you
while
trot
was
thinking
this
over
the
swimmers
drew
near
to
a
great
circular
palace
made
all
of
solid
alabaster
polished
as
smooth
as
ivory
its
roof
was
a
vast
dome
for
domes
seemed
to
be
fashionable
in
the
ocean
houses
there
were
no
doors
or
windows
but
instead
of
these
several
round
holes
appeared
in
different
parts
of
the
dome
some
being
high
up
and
some
low
down
and
some
in
between
out
of
one
of
these
holes
which
it
just
fitted
stretched
the
long
brown
body
of
the
sea
serpent
trot
being
astonished
at
this
sight
asked
did
you
take
all
of
you
when
you
went
to
the
cavern
anko
nearly
all
my
dear
was
the
reply
accompanied
by
a
cheerful
smile
for
anko
was
proud
of
his
great
length
but
not
quite
all
some
of
me
remained
as
usual
to
keep
house
while
my
head
was
away
but
i
been
coiling
up
ever
since
we
started
back
and
you
will
soon
be
able
to
see
every
inch
of
me
all
together
even
as
he
spoke
his
head
slid
into
the
round
hole
and
at
a
signal
from
aquareine
they
all
paused
outside
and
waited
presently
there
came
to
them
four
beautiful
winged
fishes
with
faces
like
doll
babies
their
long
hair
and
eyelashes
were
of
a
purple
color
and
their
cheeks
had
rosy
spots
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
painted
upon
them
his
majesty
bids
you
welcome
said
one
of
the
doll
fishes
in
a
sweet
voice
be
kind
enough
to
enter
the
royal
palace
and
our
ocean
monarch
will
graciously
receive
you
seems
to
me
said
trot
to
the
queen
these
things
are
putting
on
airs
perhaps
they
do
know
we
friends
of
anko
the
king
insists
on
certain
formalities
when
anyone
visits
him
was
aquareine
reply
it
is
right
that
his
dignity
should
be
maintained
they
followed
their
winged
conductors
to
one
of
the
upper
openings
and
as
they
entered
it
aquareine
said
in
a
clear
voice
may
the
glory
and
power
of
the
ocean
king
continue
forever
then
she
touched
the
palm
of
her
hand
to
her
forehead
in
token
of
allegiance
and
clia
did
the
same
so
bill
and
trot
followed
suit
the
brief
ceremony
being
ended
the
child
looked
curiously
around
to
see
what
the
palace
of
the
mighty
anko
was
like
an
extensive
hall
lined
with
alabaster
was
before
them
in
the
floor
were
five
of
the
round
holes
upon
the
walls
were
engraved
many
interesting
scenes
of
ocean
life
all
chiseled
very
artistically
by
the
tusks
of
walruses
who
trot
was
afterward
informed
are
greatly
skilled
in
such
work
a
few
handsome
rugs
of
woven
sea
grasses
were
spread
upon
the
floor
but
otherwise
the
vast
hall
was
bare
of
furniture
the
fishes
escorted
them
to
an
upper
room
where
a
table
was
set
and
here
the
revelers
were
invited
to
refresh
themselves
as
all
four
were
exceedingly
hungry
they
welcomed
the
repast
which
was
served
by
an
army
of
lobsters
in
royal
purple
aprons
and
caps
the
meal
being
finished
they
again
descended
to
the
hall
which
seemed
to
occupy
all
the
middle
of
the
building
and
now
their
conductors
said
his
majesty
is
ready
to
receive
you
in
his
den
they
swam
downward
through
one
of
the
round
holes
in
the
floor
and
found
themselves
in
a
brilliantly
lighted
chamber
which
appeared
bigger
than
all
the
rest
of
the
palace
put
together
in
the
center
was
the
quaint
head
of
king
anko
and
around
it
was
spread
a
great
coverlet
of
purple
and
gold
woven
together
this
concealed
all
of
his
body
and
stretched
from
wall
to
wall
of
the
circular
room
welcome
friends
said
anko
pleasantly
how
do
you
like
my
home
it
very
grand
replied
trot
just
the
place
for
a
sea
serpent
seems
to
me
said
bill
i
glad
you
admire
it
said
the
king
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
from
this
day
you
four
belong
to
me
how
that
asked
the
girl
surprised
it
is
a
law
of
the
ocean
declared
anko
that
whoever
saves
any
living
creature
from
violent
death
owns
that
creature
forever
afterward
while
life
lasts
you
will
realize
how
just
this
law
is
when
you
remember
that
had
i
not
saved
you
from
zog
you
would
now
be
dead
the
law
was
suggested
by
captain
kid
glove
when
he
once
visited
me
do
you
mean
captain
kidd
asked
trot
because
if
you
do
give
him
his
full
name
said
anko
captain
kid
glove
was
there
no
glove
to
it
protested
trot
i
ought
to
know
i
read
about
him
did
it
say
anything
about
a
glove
asked
anko
nothing
at
all
it
jus
called
him
kidd
replied
trot
she
right
ol
man
added
bill
books
said
the
sea
serpent
are
good
enough
as
far
as
they
go
but
it
seems
to
me
your
earth
books
do
go
far
enough
captain
kid
glove
was
a
gentleman
pirate
a
pirate
to
leave
off
the
glove
and
call
him
just
kidd
is
very
disrespectful
oh
you
told
me
to
remind
you
of
that
third
pain
said
the
little
girl
which
proves
my
friendship
for
you
returned
the
sea
serpent
blinking
his
blue
eyes
thoughtfully
no
one
likes
to
be
reminded
of
a
pain
and
that
third
pain
was
was
what
was
it
asked
trot
it
was
a
stomach
ache
replied
the
king
with
a
sigh
what
made
it
she
inquired
just
my
carelessness
said
anko
i
been
away
to
foreign
parts
seeing
how
the
earth
people
were
getting
along
i
found
the
germans
dancing
the
german
and
the
dutch
making
dutch
cheese
and
the
belgians
combing
their
belgian
hares
and
the
turks
eating
turkey
and
the
sardinians
sardonically
pickling
sardines
then
i
called
on
the
prince
of
whales
and
you
mean
the
prince
of
wales
corrected
trot
i
mean
what
i
say
my
dear
i
saw
the
battlefield
where
the
bull
run
but
the
americans
did
and
when
i
got
to
france
i
paid
a
napoleon
to
see
napoleon
with
his
boney
apart
he
was
of
course
you
mean
trot
was
beginning
but
the
king
would
not
give
her
a
chance
to
correct
him
this
time
he
was
very
hungry
for
hungary
he
continued
and
was
russian
so
fast
toward
the
poles
that
i
thought
he
discover
them
so
as
i
was
not
accorded
a
royal
welcome
i
took
french
leave
and
came
home
again
but
the
pain
on
the
way
home
continued
anko
calmly
i
was
a
little
and
ate
an
anchor
there
was
a
long
chain
attached
to
it
and
as
i
continued
to
swallow
the
anchor
i
continued
to
eat
the
chain
i
never
realized
what
i
had
done
until
i
found
a
ship
on
the
other
end
of
the
chain
then
i
bit
it
off
the
ship
asked
trot
no
the
chain
i
did
care
for
the
ship
as
i
saw
it
contained
some
skippers
on
the
way
home
the
chain
and
anchor
began
to
lie
heavily
on
my
stomach
i
did
seem
to
digest
them
properly
and
by
the
time
i
got
to
my
palace
where
you
will
notice
there
is
no
throne
i
was
thrown
into
throes
of
severe
pain
so
i
at
once
sent
for
shark
are
all
your
doctors
sharks
asked
the
child
yes
are
your
doctors
sharks
he
replied
not
all
of
them
said
trot
that
is
true
remarked
bill
but
when
you
talk
of
lawyers
i
not
talking
of
lawyers
said
anko
reprovingly
i
talking
about
my
pain
i
do
imagine
anyone
could
suffer
more
than
i
did
with
that
stomach
ache
did
you
suffer
long
inquired
trot
why
about
seven
thousand
four
hundred
and
feet
and
i
mean
a
long
time
it
seemed
like
a
long
time
answered
the
king
shark
said
i
ought
to
put
a
mustard
poultice
on
my
stomach
so
i
uncoiled
myself
and
summoned
my
servants
and
they
began
putting
on
the
mustard
plaster
it
had
to
be
bound
all
around
me
so
it
would
slip
off
and
i
began
to
look
like
an
express
package
in
about
four
weeks
fully
of
the
pain
had
been
covered
by
the
mustard
poultice
which
got
so
hot
that
it
hurt
me
worse
than
the
stomach
ache
did
i
know
said
trot
i
had
one
once
one
what
asked
anko
a
mustard
plaster
they
smart
pretty
bad
but
i
guess
they
a
good
thing
i
got
myself
unwrapped
as
soon
as
i
could
continued
the
king
and
then
i
hunted
for
the
doctor
who
hid
himself
until
my
anger
had
subsided
he
has
never
sent
in
a
bill
so
i
think
he
must
be
terribly
ashamed
of
himself
you
lucky
sir
to
have
escaped
so
easy
said
bill
but
you
seem
pretty
well
now
yes
i
more
careful
of
what
i
eat
replied
the
sea
serpent
but
i
was
saying
when
trot
interrupted
me
that
you
all
belong
to
me
because
i
have
saved
your
lives
by
the
law
of
the
ocean
you
must
obey
me
in
everything
the
sailor
scowled
a
little
at
hearing
this
but
trot
laughed
and
said
the
law
of
the
ocean
is
our
law
we
live
on
land
just
now
you
are
living
in
the
ocean
declared
anko
and
as
long
as
you
live
here
you
must
obey
my
commands
what
are
your
commands
inquired
the
child
ah
that
the
point
i
was
coming
to
returned
the
king
with
his
comical
smile
the
ocean
is
a
beautiful
place
and
we
who
belong
here
love
it
dearly
in
many
ways
it
a
nicer
place
for
a
home
than
the
earth
for
we
have
no
sunstroke
mosquitoes
earthquakes
or
candy
ships
to
bother
us
but
i
am
convinced
that
the
ocean
is
no
proper
dwelling
place
for
earth
people
and
i
believe
the
mermaids
did
an
unwise
thing
when
they
invited
you
to
visit
them
i
do
protested
the
girl
we
had
a
fine
time
have
we
bill
well
it
been
from
what
i
expected
admitted
the
sailor
our
only
thought
was
to
give
the
earth
people
pleasure
your
majesty
pleaded
aquareine
i
know
i
know
my
dear
queen
and
it
was
very
good
of
you
replied
anko
but
still
it
was
an
unwise
act
for
earth
people
are
as
constantly
in
danger
under
water
as
we
would
be
upon
the
land
so
having
won
the
right
to
command
you
all
i
order
you
to
take
little
mayre
and
bill
straight
home
and
there
restore
them
to
their
natural
forms
it
a
dreadful
condition
i
know
and
they
must
each
have
two
stumbling
legs
instead
of
a
strong
beautiful
fish
tail
but
it
is
the
fate
of
earth
dwellers
and
they
can
not
escape
it
in
my
case
your
majesty
make
it
one
leg
suggested
bill
ah
yes
i
remember
one
leg
and
a
wooden
stick
to
keep
it
company
i
issue
this
order
dear
friends
not
because
i
am
not
fond
of
your
society
but
to
keep
you
from
getting
into
more
trouble
in
a
country
where
all
is
strange
and
unnatural
to
you
am
i
right
or
do
you
think
i
am
wrong
you
quite
correct
sir
said
bill
nodding
his
head
in
approval
well
i
ready
to
go
home
said
trot
but
in
spite
of
zog
enjoyed
my
visit
and
i
shall
always
love
the
mermaids
for
being
so
good
to
me
that
speech
pleased
aquareine
and
clia
who
smiled
upon
the
child
and
kissed
her
affectionately
we
shall
escort
you
home
at
once
announced
the
queen
but
before
you
go
said
king
anko
i
will
give
you
a
rare
treat
it
is
one
you
will
remember
as
long
as
you
live
you
shall
see
every
inch
of
the
mightiest
sea
serpent
in
the
world
all
at
one
time
as
he
spoke
the
purple
and
gold
cloth
was
lifted
by
unseen
hands
and
disappeared
from
view
and
now
bill
and
trot
looked
down
upon
thousands
and
thousands
of
coils
of
the
sea
serpent
body
which
filled
all
of
the
space
at
the
bottom
of
the
immense
circular
room
it
reminded
them
of
a
great
coil
of
garden
hose
only
it
was
so
much
bigger
around
and
very
much
longer
except
for
the
astonishing
size
of
the
ocean
king
the
sight
was
not
an
especially
interesting
one
but
they
told
old
anko
that
they
were
pleased
to
see
him
because
it
was
evident
he
was
very
fond
of
his
figure
then
the
cloth
descended
again
and
covered
all
but
the
head
after
which
they
bade
the
king
goodbye
and
thanked
him
for
all
his
kindness
to
them
i
used
to
think
sea
serpents
were
horrid
creatures
said
trot
but
now
i
know
they
are
good
and
and
and
and
big
added
bill
realizing
his
little
friend
could
not
find
another
word
that
was
complimentary
chapter
king
joe
as
they
swam
out
of
anko
palace
and
the
fishes
left
them
aquareine
asked
would
you
rather
go
back
to
our
mermaid
home
for
a
time
and
rest
yourselves
or
would
you
prefer
to
start
for
giant
cave
at
once
i
guess
we
better
go
back
home
decided
trot
to
our
own
home
i
mean
we
been
away
quite
a
while
and
king
anko
seemed
to
think
it
was
best
very
well
replied
the
queen
let
us
turn
in
this
direction
then
you
can
say
goodbye
to
merla
for
us
continued
trot
she
was
very
nice
to
us
an
to
bill
so
she
was
mate
agreed
the
sailor
an
a
prettier
lady
i
never
knew
even
if
she
is
a
mermaid
beggin
your
pardon
are
we
going
anywhere
near
zog
castle
asked
the
girl
our
way
leads
directly
past
the
opening
in
the
dome
said
aquareine
then
let
stop
and
see
what
sacho
and
the
others
are
doing
suggested
trot
they
ca
be
slaves
any
longer
you
know
they
have
any
master
i
wonder
if
they
any
happier
than
they
were
before
they
seemed
to
be
pretty
happy
as
it
was
remarked
bill
it
will
do
no
harm
to
pay
them
a
brief
visit
said
princess
clia
all
danger
disappeared
from
the
cavern
with
the
destruction
of
zog
i
really
ought
to
say
goodbye
to
brother
joe
observed
the
sailor
man
i
wo
see
him
again
you
know
and
i
do
want
to
seem
unbrotherly
very
well
said
the
queen
we
will
reenter
the
cavern
for
i
too
am
anxious
to
know
what
will
be
the
fate
of
the
poor
slaves
of
the
magician
when
they
came
to
the
hole
in
the
top
of
the
dome
they
dropped
through
it
and
swam
leisurely
down
toward
the
castle
the
water
was
clear
and
undisturbed
and
the
silver
castle
looked
very
quiet
and
peaceful
under
the
radiant
light
that
still
filled
the
cavern
they
met
no
one
at
all
and
passing
around
to
the
front
of
the
building
they
reached
the
broad
entrance
and
passed
into
the
golden
hall
here
a
strange
scene
met
their
eyes
all
the
slaves
of
zog
hundreds
in
number
were
assembled
in
the
room
while
standing
before
the
throne
formerly
occupied
by
the
wicked
magician
was
the
boy
sacho
who
was
just
beginning
to
make
a
speech
to
his
fellow
slaves
at
one
time
or
another
he
said
all
of
us
were
born
upon
the
earth
and
lived
in
the
thin
air
but
now
we
are
all
living
as
the
fishes
live
and
our
home
is
in
the
water
of
the
ocean
one
by
one
we
have
come
to
this
place
having
been
saved
from
drowning
by
zog
the
magician
and
by
him
given
power
to
exist
in
comfort
under
water
the
powerful
master
who
made
us
his
slaves
has
now
passed
away
forever
but
we
continue
to
live
and
are
unable
to
return
to
our
native
land
where
we
would
quickly
perish
there
is
no
one
but
us
to
inherit
zog
possessions
and
so
it
will
be
best
for
us
to
remain
in
this
fine
castle
and
occupy
ourselves
as
we
have
done
before
in
providing
for
the
comforts
of
the
community
only
in
labor
is
happiness
to
be
found
and
we
may
as
well
labor
for
ourselves
as
for
others
but
we
must
have
a
king
not
an
evil
cruel
master
like
zog
but
one
who
will
maintain
order
and
issue
laws
for
the
benefit
of
all
we
will
govern
ourselves
most
happily
by
having
a
ruler
or
head
selected
from
among
ourselves
by
popular
vote
therefore
i
ask
you
to
decide
who
shall
be
our
king
for
only
one
who
is
accepted
by
all
can
sit
in
zog
throne
the
slaves
applauded
this
speech
but
they
seemed
puzzled
to
make
the
choice
of
a
ruler
finally
the
chief
cook
came
forward
and
said
we
all
have
our
duties
to
perform
and
so
can
not
spend
the
time
to
be
king
but
you
sacho
who
were
zog
own
attendant
have
now
no
duties
at
all
so
it
will
be
best
for
you
to
rule
us
what
say
you
comrades
shall
we
make
sacho
king
yes
yes
they
all
cried
but
i
do
not
wish
to
be
king
replied
sacho
a
king
is
a
useless
sort
of
person
who
merely
issues
orders
for
others
to
carry
out
i
want
to
be
busy
and
useful
whoever
is
king
will
need
a
good
attendant
as
well
as
an
officer
who
will
see
that
his
commands
are
obeyed
i
am
used
to
such
duties
having
served
zog
in
this
same
way
who
then
has
the
time
to
rule
over
us
asked
the
goldsmith
it
seems
to
me
that
joe
is
the
proper
person
for
king
replied
sacho
his
former
duty
was
to
sew
buttons
on
garments
so
now
he
is
out
of
a
job
and
has
plenty
of
time
to
be
king
for
he
can
sew
on
his
own
buttons
what
do
you
say
joe
oh
i
do
mind
agreed
joe
that
is
if
you
all
want
me
to
rule
you
we
do
shouted
the
slaves
glad
to
find
someone
willing
to
take
the
job
but
i
want
a
few
pointers
continued
bill
brother
i
ai
used
to
this
sort
o
work
you
know
an
if
i
ai
properly
posted
i
liable
to
make
mistakes
sacho
will
tell
you
said
tom
atto
encouragingly
and
now
i
must
go
back
to
the
kitchen
and
look
after
my
dumplings
or
you
people
wo
have
any
dinner
today
very
well
announced
sacho
i
hereby
proclaim
joe
elected
king
of
the
castle
which
is
the
enchanted
castle
no
longer
you
may
all
return
to
your
work
the
slaves
went
away
well
contented
and
the
boy
and
joe
now
came
forward
to
greet
their
visitors
we
on
our
way
home
explained
bill
an
we
do
expec
to
travel
this
way
again
but
it
pleases
me
to
know
joe
that

fine
castle

joe

wish

as
well
fixed
if
ever
you

friends
sacho
or
any
assistance
or
counsel

said
the
mermaid
queen
to
the
boy
thank
you
madam
he
replied
now
that
zog
has
gone
i
am
sure
we
shall
be
very
safe
and
contented
but
i
shall
not
forget
to
come
to
you
if
we
need
you
we
are
not
going
to
waste
any
time
in
anger
or
revenge
or
evil
deeds
so
i
believe
we
shall
prosper
from
now
on
i
sure
you
will
declared
trot
they
now
decided
that
they
must
continue
their
journey
and
as
neither
sacho
nor
king
joe
could
ascend
to
the
top
of
the
dome
without
swimming
in
the
human
way
which
was
slow
and
tedious
work
for
them
the
goodbyes
were
said
at
the
castle
entrance
and
the
four
visitors
started
on
their
return
trot
took
one
last
view
of
the
beautiful
silver
castle
from
the
hole
high
up
in
the
dome
which
was
now
open
and
unguarded
and
the
next
moment
she
was
in
the
broad
ocean
again
swimming
toward
home
beside
her
mermaid
friends
chapter
trot
lives
to
tell
the
tale
aquareine
was
thoughtful
for
a
time
then
she
drew
from
her
finger
a
ring
a
plain
gold
band
set
with
a
pearl
of
great
value
and
gave
it
to
the
little
girl
if
at
any
period
of
your
life
the
mermaids
can
be
of
service
to
you
my
dear
she
said
you
have
but
to
come
to
the
edge
of
the
ocean
and
call
if
you
are
wearing
the
ring
at
the
time
i
shall
instantly
hear
you
and
come
to
your
assistance
thank
you
cried
the
child
slipping
the
ring
over
her
own
chubby
finger
which
it
fitted
perfectly
i
shall
never
forget
that
i
have
good
and
loyal
friends
in
the
ocean
you
may
be
sure
away
and
away
they
swam
swiftly
and
in
a
straight
line
keeping
in
the
middle
water
where
they
were
not
liable
to
meet
many
sea
people
they
passed
a
few
schools
of
fishes
where
the
teachers
were
explaining
to
the
young
ones
how
to
swim
properly
and
to
conduct
themselves
in
a
dignified
manner
but
trot
did
not
care
to
stop
and
watch
the
exercises
although
the
queen
had
lost
her
fairy
wand
in
zog
domed
chamber
she
had
still
enough
magic
power
to
carry
them
all
across
the
ocean
in
wonderfully
quick
time
and
before
trot
and
bill
were
aware
of
the
distance
they
had
come
the
mermaids
paused
while
princess
clia
said
now
we
must
go
a
little
deeper
for
here
is
the
giant
cave
and
the
entrance
to
it
is
near
the
bottom
of
the
sea
what
already
cried
the
girl
joyfully
and
then
through
the
dark
water
they
swam
passing
through
the
rocky
entrance
and
began
to
ascend
slowly
into
the
water
of
the
cave
you
been
awfully
good
to
us
and
i
do
know
jus
how
to
thank
you
said
trot
earnestly
we
have
enjoyed
your
visit
to
us
said
beautiful
queen
aquareine
smiling
upon
her
little
friend
and
you
may
easily
repay
any
pleasure
we
have
given
you
by
speaking
well
of
the
mermaids
when
you
hear
ignorant
earth
people
condemning
us
i
do
that
of
course
exclaimed
the
child
how
about
changin
us
back
to
our
shapes
inquired
bill
anxiously
that
will
be
very
easy
replied
princess
clia
with
her
merry
laugh
see
here
we
are
at
the
surface
of
the
water
they
pushed
their
heads
above
the
blue
water
and
looked
around
the
cave
it
was
silent
and
deserted
floating
gently
near
the
spot
where
they
had
left
it
was
their
own
little
boat
bill
swam
to
it
took
hold
of
the
side
and
then
turned
an
inquiring
face
toward
the
mermaids
climb
in
said
the
queen
so
he
pulled
himself
up
and
awkwardly
tumbled
forward
into
the
boat
as
he
did
so
he
heard
his
wooden
leg
clatter
against
the
seat
and
turned
around
to
look
at
it
wonderingly
it
me
all
right
he
muttered
one
meat
one
an
one
one
that
the
same
as
belongs
to
me
will
you
lift
mayre
aboard
asked
princess
clia
the
old
sailor
aroused
himself
and
as
trot
lifted
up
her
arms
he
seized
them
and
drew
her
safely
into
the
boat
she
was
dressed
just
as
usual
and
her
chubby
legs
wore
shoes
and
stockings
strangely
enough
neither
of
them
were
at
all
wet
or
even
damp
in
any
part
of
their
clothing
i
wonder
where
our
legs
have
been
while
we
been
gone
mused
bill
gazing
at
his
little
friend
in
great
delight
and
i
wonder
what
become
of
our
pretty
pink
and
green
scaled
tails
returned
the
girl
laughing
with
glee
for
it
seemed
good
to
be
herself
again
queen
aquareine
and
princess
clia
were
a
little
way
off
lying
with
their
pretty
faces
just
out
of
the
water
while
their
hair
floated
in
soft
clouds
around
them
goodbye
friends
they
called
goodbye
shouted
both
trot
and
bill
and
the
little
girl
blew
two
kisses
from
her
fingers
toward
the
mermaids
then
the
faces
disappeared
leaving
little
ripples
on
the
surface
of
the
water
bill
picked
up
the
oars
and
slowly
headed
the
boat
toward
the
mouth
of
the
cave
i
wonder
trot
if
your
ma
has
missed
us
he
remarked
uneasily
of
course
not
replied
the
girl
she
been
sound
asleep
you
know
as
the
boat
crept
out
into
the
bright
sunlight
they
were
both
silent
but
each
sighed
with
pleasure
at
beholding
their
own
everyday
world
again
finally
trot
said
softly
the
land
the
best
it
is
mate
for
livin
on
he
answered
but
i
glad
to
have
seen
the
mermaids
she
well
so
i
trot
he
agreed
but
i
would
believed
any
mortal
could
ever
seen
an
an
trot
laughed
merrily
an
lived
to
tell
the
tale
she
cried
her
eyes
dancing
with
mischief
oh
bill
how
little
we
mortals
know
true
enough
mate
he
replied
but
we
something
day
the
end
