reasoning
reasoning
is
defined
as
the
act
process
or
art
of
exercising
the
faculty
of
reason
the
act
or
faculty
of
employing
reason
in
argument
argumentation
ratiocination
reasoning
power
disputation
discussion
argumentation
stewart
says
the
word
itself
is
far
from
being
precise
in
its
meaning
in
common
and
popular
discourse
it
denotes
that
power
by
which
we
distinguish
truth
from
falsehood
and
right
from
wrong
and
by
which
we
are
enabled
to
combine
means
for
the
attainment
of
particular
ends
by
the
employment
of
the
reasoning
faculties
of
the
mind
we
compare
objects
presented
to
the
mind
as
percepts
or
concepts
taking
up
the
raw
materials
of
thought
and
weaving
them
into
more
complex
and
elaborate
mental
fabrics
which
we
call
abstract
and
general
ideas
of
truth
brooks
says
it
is
the
thinking
power
of
the
mind
the
faculty
which
gives
us
what
has
been
called
in
distinction
from
it
may
be
regarded
as
the
mental
architect
among
the
faculties
it
transforms
the
material
furnished
by
the
senses
into
new
products
and
thus
builds
up
the
temples
of
science
and
philosophy
the
authority
adds
its
products
are
twofold
and
an
is
a
mental
product
which
when
expressed
in
words
does
not
give
a
proposition
a
is
a
mental
product
which
embraces
the
relation
of
two
or
more
ideas
the
ideas
of
the
understanding
are
of
two
general
classes
abstract
ideas
and
general
ideas
the
thoughts
are
also
of
two
general
classes
those
pertaining
to
contingent
truth
and
those
pertaining
to
necessary
truth
in
contingent
truth
we
have
or
immediate
judgments
and
including
and
derived
from
particular
facts
in
necessary
truth
we
have
or
truths
and
the
truths
derived
from
them
by
reasoning
called
in
inviting
you
to
consider
the
processes
of
reasoning
we
are
irresistibly
reminded
of
the
old
story
of
one
of
moliere
plays
in
which
one
of
the
characters
expresses
surprise
on
learning
that
he
had
been
talking
prose
for
forty
years
without
knowing
it
as
jevons
says
in
mentioning
this
people
out
of
a
hundred
might
be
equally
surprised
on
hearing
that
they
had
been
converting
propositions
syllogizing
falling
into
paralogisms
framing
hypotheses
and
making
classifications
with
genera
and
species
if
asked
whether
they
were
logicians
they
would
probably
answer
no
they
would
be
partly
right
for
i
believe
that
a
large
number
even
of
educated
persons
have
no
clear
idea
of
what
logic
is
yet
in
a
certain
way
every
one
must
have
been
a
logician
since
he
began
to
speak
so
in
asking
you
to
consider
the
processes
of
reasoning
we
are
not
assuming
that
you
never
have
reasoned
on
the
contrary
we
are
fully
aware
that
you
in
connection
with
every
other
person
have
reasoned
all
your
mature
life
that
is
not
the
question
while
everyone
reasons
the
fact
is
equally
true
that
the
majority
of
persons
reason
incorrectly
many
persons
reason
along
lines
far
from
correct
and
scientific
and
suffer
therefor
and
thereby
some
writers
have
claimed
that
the
majority
of
persons
are
incapable
of
even
fairly
correct
reasoning
pointing
to
the
absurd
ideas
entertained
by
the
masses
of
people
as
a
proof
of
the
statement
these
writers
are
probably
a
little
radical
in
their
views
and
statements
but
one
is
often
struck
with
wonder
at
the
evidences
of
incapacity
for
interpreting
facts
and
impressions
on
the
part
of
the
general
public
the
masses
of
people
accept
the
most
absurd
ideas
as
truth
providing
they
are
gravely
asserted
by
some
one
claiming
authority
the
most
illogical
ideas
are
accepted
without
dispute
or
examination
providing
they
are
stated
solemnly
and
authoritatively
particularly
in
the
respective
fields
of
religion
and
politics
do
we
find
this
blind
acceptance
of
illogical
ideas
by
the
multitude
mere
assertion
by
the
leaders
seems
sufficient
for
the
multitude
of
followers
to
acquiesce
in
order
to
reason
correctly
it
is
not
merely
necessary
to
have
a
good
intellect
an
athlete
may
have
the
proper
proportions
good
framework
and
symmetrical
muscles
but
he
can
not
expect
to
cope
with
others
of
his
kind
unless
he
has
learned
to
develop
those
muscles
and
to
use
them
to
the
best
advantage
and
in
the
same
way
the
man
who
wishes
to
reason
correctly
must
develop
his
intellectual
faculties
and
must
also
learn
the
art
of
using
them
to
the
best
advantage
otherwise
he
will
waste
his
mental
energy
and
will
be
placed
at
a
disadvantage
when
confronted
with
a
trained
logician
in
argument
or
debate
one
who
has
witnessed
a
debate
or
argument
between
two
men
equally
strong
intellectually
one
of
whom
is
a
trained
logician
and
the
other
lacking
this
advantage
will
never
forget
the
impression
produced
upon
him
by
the
unequal
struggle
the
conflict
is
like
that
of
a
powerful
wrestler
untrained
in
the
little
tricks
and
turns
of
the
science
in
the
various
principles
of
applying
force
in
a
certain
way
at
a
certain
time
at
a
certain
place
with
a
trained
and
experienced
wrestler
or
of
a
conflict
between
a
muscular
giant
untrained
in
the
art
of
boxing
when
confronted
with
a
trained
and
experienced
exponent
of
the
manly
art
the
result
of
any
such
conflict
is
assured
in
advance
therefore
everyone
should
refuse
to
rest
content
without
a
knowledge
of
the
art
of
reasoning
correctly
for
otherwise
he
places
himself
under
a
heavy
handicap
in
the
race
for
success
and
allows
others
perhaps
less
mentally
to
have
a
decided
advantage
over
him
jevons
says
in
this
connection
to
be
a
good
logician
is
however
far
more
valuable
than
to
be
a
good
athlete
because
logic
teaches
us
to
reason
well
and
reasoning
gives
us
knowledge
and
knowledge
as
lord
bacon
said
is
power
as
athletes
men
can
not
for
a
moment
compare
with
horses
or
tigers
or
monkeys
yet
with
the
power
of
knowledge
men
tame
horses
and
shoot
tigers
and
despise
monkeys
the
weakest
framework
with
the
most
logical
mind
will
conquer
in
the
end
because
it
is
easy
to
foresee
the
future
to
calculate
the
result
of
actions
to
avoid
mistakes
which
might
be
fatal
and
to
discover
the
means
of
doing
things
which
seemed
impossible
if
such
little
creatures
as
ants
had
better
brains
than
men
they
would
either
destroy
men
or
make
them
into
slaves
it
is
true
that
we
can
not
use
our
eyes
and
ears
without
getting
some
kind
of
knowledge
and
the
brute
animals
can
do
the
same
but
what
gives
power
is
the
deeper
knowledge
called
science
people
may
see
and
hear
and
feel
all
their
lives
without
really
learning
the
nature
of
things
they
see
but
reason
is
the
mind
eye
and
enables
us
to
see
why
things
are
and
when
and
how
events
may
be
made
to
happen
or
not
to
happen
the
logician
endeavors
to
learn
exactly
what
this
reason
is
which
makes
the
power
of
men
we
all
as
i
have
said
must
reason
well
or
ill
but
logic
is
the
science
of
reasoning
and
enables
us
to
distinguish
between
the
good
reasoning
which
leads
to
truth
and
the
bad
reasoning
which
every
day
betrays
people
into
error
and
misfortune
in
this
volume
we
hope
to
be
able
to
point
out
the
methods
and
principles
of
correctly
using
the
reasoning
faculties
of
the
mind
in
a
plain
simple
manner
devoid
of
useless
technicalities
and
academic
discussion
we
shall
adhere
in
the
main
to
the
principles
established
by
the
best
of
the
authorities
of
the
old
school
of
psychology
blending
the
same
with
those
advanced
by
the
best
authorities
of
the
new
psychology
no
attempt
to
make
of
this
book
a
school
shall
be
made
for
our
sole
object
and
aim
is
to
bring
this
important
subject
before
the
general
public
composed
of
people
who
have
neither
the
time
nor
inclination
to
indulge
in
technical
discussion
nor
academic
but
who
desire
to
understand
the
underlying
of
the
laws
of
reasoning
chapter
ii
the
process
of
reasoning
the
processes
of
reasoning
may
be
said
to
comprise
four
general
stages
or
steps
as
follows
i
by
which
is
meant
the
process
of
and
from
an
object
person
or
thing
quality
or
and
making
of
it
a
distinct
object
of
thought
for
instance
if
i
perceive
in
a
the
quality
of
and
am
able
to
think
of
this
quality
abstractly
and
independently
of
the
animal
if
the
term
has
an
actual
mental
meaning
to
me
independent
of
the
lion
then
i
have
that
quality
the
thinking
thereof
is
an
act
of
and
the
itself
is
an
some
writers
hold
that
these
abstract
ideas
are
realities
and
not
mere
figments
of
fancy
as
brooks
says
the
rose
dies
but
my
idea
of
its
color
and
fragrance
remains
other
authorities
regard
abstraction
as
but
an
act
of
concentrated
upon
but
the
particular
quality
to
the
exclusion
of
others
and
that
the
abstract
idea
has
no
existence
apart
from
the
general
idea
of
the
object
in
which
it
is
included
sir
william
hamilton
says
we
can
rivet
our
attention
on
some
particular
mode
of
a
thing
as
its
smell
its
color
its
figure
its
size
and
abstract
it
from
the
others
this
may
be
called
modal
abstraction
the
abstraction
we
have
now
been
considering
is
performed
on
individual
objects
and
is
consequently
particular
there
is
nothing
necessarily
connected
with
generalization
in
abstraction
generalization
is
indeed
dependent
on
abstraction
which
it
supposes
but
abstraction
does
not
involve
generalization
ii
by
which
is
meant
the
process
of
forming
concepts
or
general
ideas
it
acts
in
the
direction
of
apprehending
the
common
qualities
of
objects
persons
and
things
and
combining
and
uniting
them
into
a
single
notion
or
which
will
comprehend
and
include
them
all
a
general
idea
or
concept
differs
from
a
particular
idea
in
that
it
includes
within
itself
the
qualities
of
the
particular
and
other
particulars
and
accordingly
may
be
applied
to
any
one
of
these
particulars
as
well
as
to
the
general
for
instance
one
may
have
a
of
some
horse
which
applies
only
to
that
particular
horse
he
may
also
have
a
general
idea
of
in
the
generic
or
sense
which
idea
applies
not
only
to
the
general
class
of
but
also
to
each
and
every
which
is
included
in
that
class
expression
of
generalization
or
conception
is
called
a
iii
by
which
is
meant
the
process
of
comparing
two
objects
persons
or
things
one
with
another
and
thus
perceiving
their
agreement
or
disagreement
thus
we
may
compare
the
two
concepts
and
and
perceiving
a
certain
agreement
between
them
we
form
the
judgment
that
a
is
an
or
comparing
and
and
perceiving
their
disagreement
we
form
the
judgment
a
is
not
a
expression
of
a
judgment
is
called
a
iv
by
which
is
meant
the
process
of
comparing
two
objects
persons
or
things
through
their
relation
to
a
third
object
person
or
thing
thus
we
may
reason
a
that
all
mammals
are
animals
b
that
a
horse
is
a
mammal
c
that
a
horse
is
an
animal
the
result
of
the
reasoning
being
the
statement
that
a
horse
is
an
animal
the
most
fundamental
principle
of
reasoning
therefore
consists
in
the
comparing
of
two
objects
of
thought
through
and
by
means
of
their
relation
to
a
third
object
natural
form
of
expression
of
this
process
of
reasoning
is
called
a
it
will
be
seen
that
these
four
processes
of
reasoning
necessitate
the
employment
of
the
processes
of
analysis
and
synthesis
respectively
analysis
means
a
separating
of
an
object
of
thought
into
its
constituent
parts
qualities
or
relations
synthesis
means
the
combining
of
the
qualities
parts
or
relations
of
an
object
of
thought
into
a
composite
whole
these
two
processes
are
found
in
all
processes
of
reasoning
abstraction
is
principally
analytic
generalization
or
conception
chiefly
synthetic
judgment
is
either
or
both
analytic
or
synthetic
reasoning
is
either
a
synthesis
of
particulars
in
induction
or
an
evolution
of
the
particular
from
the
general
in
deduction
there
are
two
great
classes
of
reasoning
inductive
reasoning
or
the
inference
of
general
truths
from
particular
truths
and
deductive
reasoning
or
the
inference
of
particular
truths
from
general
truths
proceeds
by
discovering
a
general
truth
from
particular
truths
for
instance
from
the
particular
truths
that
individual
men
die
we
discover
the
general
truth
that
all
men
must
die
or
from
observing
that
in
all
observed
instances
ice
melts
at
a
certain
temperature
we
may
infer
that
all
ice
melts
at
a
certain
temperature
inductive
reasoning
proceeds
from
the
to
the
it
is
essentially
a
synthetic
process
it
seeks
to
discover
general
laws
from
particular
facts
proceeds
by
discovering
particular
truths
from
general
truths
thus
we
reason
that
as
all
men
die
john
smith
being
a
man
must
die
or
that
as
all
ice
melts
at
a
certain
temperature
it
follows
that
the
particular
piece
of
ice
under
consideration
will
melt
at
that
certain
temperature
deductive
reasoning
is
therefore
seen
to
be
essentially
an
analytical
process
mills
says
of
inductive
reasoning
the
inductive
method
of
the
ancients
consisted
in
ascribing
the
character
of
general
truths
to
all
propositions
which
are
true
in
all
the
instances
of
which
we
have
knowledge
bacon
exposed
the
insufficiency
of
this
method
and
physical
investigation
has
now
far
outgrown
the
baconian
conception
induction
then
is
that
operation
by
which
we
infer
that
what
we
know
to
be
true
in
a
particular
case
or
cases
will
be
true
in
all
cases
which
resemble
the
former
in
certain
assignable
respects
in
other
words
induction
is
the
process
by
which
we
conclude
that
what
is
true
of
certain
individuals
of
a
class
is
true
of
the
whole
class
or
that
what
is
true
at
certain
times
will
be
true
in
similar
circumstances
at
all
times
regarding
deductive
reasoning
a
writer
says
deductive
reasoning
is
that
process
of
reasoning
by
which
we
arrive
at
the
necessary
consequences
from
admitted
or
established
brooks
says
the
general
truths
from
which
we
reason
to
particulars
are
derived
from
several
distinct
sources
some
are
intuitive
as
the
axioms
of
mathematics
or
logic
some
of
them
are
derived
from
induction
some
of
them
are
merely
hypothetical
as
in
the
investigation
of
the
physical
sciences
many
of
the
hypotheses
and
theories
of
the
physical
sciences
are
used
as
general
truth
for
deductive
reasoning
as
the
theory
of
gravitation
the
theory
of
light
etc
reasoning
from
the
theory
of
universal
gravitation
leverrier
discovered
the
position
of
a
new
planet
in
the
heavens
before
it
had
been
discovered
by
human
eyes
halleck
points
out
the
interdependence
of
inductive
and
deductive
reasoning
in
the
following
words
man
has
to
find
out
through
his
own
experience
or
that
of
others
the
from
which
he
argues
or
draws
his
conclusions
by
induction
we
examine
what
seems
to
us
a
sufficient
number
of
individual
cases
we
then
conclude
that
the
rest
of
these
cases
which
we
have
not
examined
obey
the
same
general
the
premise
cows
chew
the
cud
was
laid
down
after
a
certain
number
of
cows
had
been
examined
if
we
were
to
see
a
cow
twenty
years
hence
we
should
expect
that
she
chewed
her
cud
after
induction
has
classified
certain
phenomena
and
given
us
a
major
we
proceed
deductively
to
apply
the
inference
to
any
new
specimen
that
can
be
shown
to
belong
to
that
class
the
several
steps
of
deductive
reasoning
shall
now
be
considered
in
turn
as
we
proceed
chapter
iii
the
concept
in
considering
the
process
of
thinking
we
must
classify
the
several
steps
or
stages
of
thought
that
we
may
examine
each
in
detail
for
the
purpose
of
comprehending
them
combined
as
a
whole
in
actual
thinking
these
several
steps
or
stages
are
not
clearly
separated
in
consciousness
so
that
each
stands
out
clear
and
distinct
from
the
preceding
and
succeeding
steps
or
stages
but
on
the
contrary
they
blend
and
shade
into
each
other
so
that
it
is
often
difficult
to
draw
a
clear
dividing
line
the
first
step
or
stage
in
the
process
of
thinking
is
that
which
is
called
a
concept
is
a
mental
representation
of
anything
wm
james
says
the
function
by
which
we
mark
off
discriminate
draw
a
line
around
and
identify
a
numerically
distinct
subject
of
discourse
is
called
there
are
five
stages
or
steps
in
each
concept
as
follows
i
before
a
concept
may
be
formed
there
must
first
be
a
presentation
of
the
material
from
which
the
concept
is
to
be
formed
if
we
wish
to
form
the
concept
we
must
first
have
perceived
an
animal
probably
several
kinds
of
animals
horses
dogs
cats
cows
pigs
lions
tigers
etc
we
must
also
have
received
impressions
from
the
sight
of
these
animals
which
may
be
reproduced
by
the
memory
represented
to
the
mind
in
order
that
we
may
have
a
full
concept
of
we
should
have
perceived
every
kind
of
animal
for
otherwise
there
would
be
some
elements
of
the
full
concept
lacking
accordingly
it
is
practically
impossible
to
have
a
concept
of
anything
the
greater
the
opportunities
for
perception
the
greater
will
be
the
opportunity
for
conception
in
other
books
of
this
series
we
have
spoken
of
the
value
and
importance
of
the
attention
and
of
clear
and
full
perception
without
an
active
employment
of
the
attention
it
is
impossible
to
receive
a
clear
perception
of
anything
and
unless
the
perception
has
been
clear
it
is
impossible
for
the
mind
to
form
a
clear
concept
of
the
thing
perceived
as
sir
wm
hamilton
has
said
an
act
of
attention
that
is
an
act
of
concentration
seems
thus
necessary
to
every
exertion
of
consciousness
as
a
certain
contraction
of
the
pupil
is
requisite
to
every
exertion
of
vision
attention
then
is
to
consciousness
what
the
contraction
of
the
pupil
is
to
sight
or
to
the
eye
of
the
mind
what
the
microscope
or
telescope
is
to
the
bodily
eye
it
constitutes
the
half
of
all
intellectual
power
and
sir
brodie
said
it
is
attention
much
more
than
in
the
abstract
power
of
reasoning
which
constitutes
the
vast
difference
which
exists
between
minds
of
different
individuals
and
as
beattie
says
the
force
with
which
anything
strikes
the
mind
is
generally
in
proportion
to
the
degree
of
attention
bestowed
upon
it
ii
following
the
stage
of
presentation
is
the
stage
of
comparison
we
separate
our
general
concept
of
into
a
number
of
or
concepts
of
various
kinds
of
animals
we
compare
the
pig
with
the
goat
the
cow
with
the
horse
in
fact
each
animal
with
all
other
animals
known
to
us
by
this
process
we
distinguish
the
points
of
resemblance
and
the
points
of
difference
we
perceive
that
the
wolf
resembles
the
dog
to
a
considerable
degree
that
it
has
some
points
of
resemblance
to
the
fox
and
a
still
less
distinct
resemblance
to
the
bear
also
that
it
differs
materially
from
the
horse
the
cow
or
the
elephant
we
also
learn
that
there
are
various
kinds
of
wolves
all
bearing
a
great
resemblance
to
each
other
and
yet
having
marked
points
of
difference
the
closer
we
observe
the
various
individuals
among
the
wolves
the
more
points
of
difference
do
we
find
the
faculty
of
comparison
evidences
itself
in
inductive
reasoning
ability
and
disposition
to
analyze
classify
compare
etc
fowler
says
that
those
in
whom
it
is
largely
developed
reason
clearly
and
correctly
from
conclusions
and
scientific
facts
up
to
the
laws
which
govern
them
discern
the
known
from
the
unknown
detect
error
by
its
incongruity
with
facts
have
an
excellent
talent
for
comparing
explaining
expounding
criticising
exposing
etc
william
james
says
any
personal
or
practical
interest
in
the
results
to
be
obtained
by
distinguishing
makes
one
wits
amazingly
sharp
to
detect
differences
and
long
training
and
practice
in
distinguishing
has
the
same
effect
as
personal
interest
both
of
these
agencies
give
to
small
amounts
of
objective
difference
the
same
effectiveness
upon
the
mind
that
under
other
circumstances
only
large
ones
would
make
iii
following
the
stage
of
comparison
is
that
of
abstraction
the
term
abstraction
as
used
in
psychology
means
the
act
or
process
of
separating
from
the
numerous
qualities
inherent
in
any
object
the
particular
one
which
we
wish
to
make
the
subject
of
observation
and
reflection
or
the
act
of
withdrawing
the
consciousness
from
a
number
of
objects
with
a
view
to
concentrate
it
on
some
particular
one
the
negative
act
of
which
attention
is
the
positive
to
is
to
separate
or
set
apart
in
the
process
of
abstraction
in
our
consideration
of
after
having
recognized
the
various
points
of
difference
and
resemblance
between
the
various
species
and
individuals
we
proceed
to
consider
some
special
quality
of
animals
and
in
doing
so
we
set
aside
or
separate
the
particular
quality
which
we
wish
to
consider
if
we
wish
to
consider
the
of
animals
we
abstract
the
quality
of
size
from
the
other
qualities
and
consider
animals
with
reference
to
size
alone
thus
we
consider
the
various
degrees
of
size
of
the
various
animals
classifying
them
accordingly
in
the
same
way
we
may
abstract
the
quality
of
shape
color
or
habits
respectively
setting
aside
this
quality
for
special
observation
and
classification
if
we
wish
to
study
examine
or
consider
certain
qualities
in
a
thing
we
abstract
that
particular
quality
from
the
other
qualities
of
the
thing
or
we
abstract
the
other
qualities
until
nothing
is
left
but
the
particular
quality
under
consideration
in
examining
or
considering
a
class
or
number
of
things
we
first
abstract
the
qualities
in
by
the
class
or
number
of
things
and
also
abstract
or
set
aside
the
qualities
to
them
for
instance
in
considering
classes
of
animals
we
abstract
the
combined
quality
of
and
which
is
possessed
in
common
by
a
number
of
animals
then
we
group
these
several
animals
in
a
class
which
we
name
the
of
which
the
opossum
and
kangaroo
are
members
in
these
animals
the
young
are
brought
forth
in
an
imperfect
condition
undeveloped
in
size
and
condition
and
are
then
kept
in
the
pouch
and
nourished
until
they
are
able
to
care
for
themselves
likewise
we
may
abstract
the
idea
of
the
the
appendage
which
connects
the
young
unborn
animal
with
the
mother
and
by
means
of
which
the
foetus
is
nourished
the
animals
distinguished
by
this
quality
are
grouped
together
as
the
placental
mammals
the
placental
mammals
are
divided
into
various
groups
by
an
abstraction
of
qualities
or
class
resemblance
or
difference
as
follows
the
or
toothless
creatures
such
as
the
sloths
armadillos
etc
the
from
their
fancied
resemblance
to
the
fabled
sirens
among
which
class
are
the
manatees
dugongs
etc
the
or
whale
family
which
although
in
appearance
are
really
mammals
giving
birth
to
living
young
which
they
nourish
with
among
which
are
the
whales
porpoises
dolphins
etc
the
or
hoofed
animals
such
as
the
horse
the
tapir
the
rhinoceros
the
swine
the
hippopotamus
the
camel
the
deer
the
sheep
the
cow
etc
the
having
teeth
resembling
both
the
hoofed
animals
and
the
gnawing
animals
of
which
the
coney
or
is
the
principal
example
the
or
trunked
animals
which
family
is
represented
by
the
various
families
of
elephants
the
or
represented
by
various
and
species
the
or
gnawers
the
or
insect
feeders
the
or
the
or
lemurs
having
the
general
appearance
of
the
monkey
but
also
the
long
bushy
tail
of
the
fox
the
including
the
monkeys
baboons
gibbons
gorillas
chimpanzees
and
man
in
all
of
these
cases
you
will
see
that
each
class
or
general
family
possesses
a
certain
which
gives
it
its
classification
and
which
quality
is
the
subject
of
the
abstraction
in
considering
the
particular
group
of
animals
further
and
closer
abstraction
divides
these
classes
into
for
instance
the
family
or
class
of
the
or
may
be
divided
by
further
abstraction
into
the
classes
of
seals
bears
weasels
wolves
dogs
lions
tigers
leopards
etc
in
this
process
we
must
first
make
the
more
general
abstraction
of
the
wolf
and
similar
animals
into
the
and
the
lion
tiger
and
similar
forms
into
the
halleck
says
of
abstraction
in
the
process
of
abstraction
we
draw
our
attention
away
from
a
mass
of
confusing
details
unimportant
at
the
time
and
attend
only
to
qualities
common
to
the
class
abstraction
is
little
else
than
centering
the
power
of
attention
on
some
qualities
to
the
exclusion
of
others
iv
arising
from
the
stage
of
abstraction
is
the
stage
of
generalization
is
the
act
or
process
of
generalizing
or
making
general
bringing
several
objects
agreeing
in
some
point
under
a
common
or
general
name
head
or
class
an
extending
from
particulars
to
generals
reducing
or
arranging
in
a
genus
bringing
a
particular
fact
or
series
of
facts
into
a
relation
with
a
wider
circle
of
facts
as
bolingbroke
says
the
mind
therefore
makes
its
utmost
endeavors
to
its
ideas
beginning
early
with
such
as
are
most
familiar
and
coming
in
time
to
those
which
are
less
so
under
the
head
of
abstraction
we
have
seen
that
through
abstraction
we
may
generalize
the
various
species
into
the
various
families
and
thus
in
turn
into
the
various
following
the
same
process
we
may
narrow
down
the
into
species
composed
of
various
individuals
or
into
greater
and
still
greater
families
or
groups
generalization
is
really
the
act
of
classification
or
forming
into
classes
all
things
having
certain
qualities
or
properties
the
corollary
is
that
things
in
a
certain
generalized
class
must
possess
the
particular
quality
or
property
common
to
the
thus
we
know
that
all
animals
in
the
class
of
the
must
eat
flesh
and
that
all
possess
breasts
from
which
they
feed
their
young
as
halleck
says
we
put
all
objects
having
like
qualities
into
a
certain
or
class
when
the
objects
are
in
that
class
know
that
certain
qualities
will
have
a
general
application
to
them
following
closely
upon
the
step
of
generalization
or
classification
is
the
step
of
denomination
by
we
mean
the
act
of
naming
or
designating
by
a
name
a
name
is
the
symbol
by
which
we
think
of
a
familiar
thing
without
the
necessity
for
making
a
distinct
mental
image
upon
each
occasion
of
thought
or
it
may
be
considered
as
akin
to
a
affixed
to
a
thing
as
in
the
case
of
the
algebraic
symbols
and
by
the
use
of
which
we
are
able
to
make
intricate
calculations
easily
and
rapidly
so
may
we
use
these
word
symbols
much
more
readily
than
we
could
the
lengthy
descriptions
or
even
the
mental
images
of
the
thing
symbolized
it
is
much
easier
for
us
to
think
than
it
would
be
to
think
the
full
definition
of
that
animal
or
to
think
of
it
by
recalling
a
mental
picture
of
the
horse
each
time
we
wished
to
think
of
it
or
it
is
much
better
for
us
to
be
able
to
glance
at
a
label
on
a
package
or
bottle
than
to
examine
the
contents
in
detail
as
hobbes
says
a
word
taken
at
pleasure
to
serve
for
a
mark
which
may
raise
in
our
minds
a
thought
like
to
some
thought
we
had
before
and
which
being
pronounced
to
others
may
be
to
them
a
sign
of
what
thought
the
speaker
had
or
had
not
before
in
his
mind
mill
says
a
name
is
a
word
or
set
of
words
serving
the
double
purpose
of
a
mark
to
recall
to
ourselves
the
likeness
of
a
former
thought
and
as
a
sign
to
make
it
known
to
others
some
philosophers
regard
names
as
symbols
of
ideas
of
rather
than
of
the
things
themselves
others
regard
them
as
symbols
of
the
things
themselves
it
will
be
seen
that
the
value
of
a
name
depends
materially
upon
the
correct
meaning
and
understanding
regarding
it
possessed
by
the
person
using
it
chapter
iv
the
use
of
concepts
having
observed
the
several
steps
or
stages
of
a
concept
let
us
now
consider
the
use
and
misuse
of
the
latter
at
first
glance
it
would
appear
difficult
to
misuse
a
concept
but
a
little
consideration
will
show
that
people
very
commonly
fall
into
error
regarding
their
concepts
for
instance
a
child
perceives
a
horse
a
cow
or
a
sheep
and
hears
its
elders
apply
the
term
to
it
this
term
is
perfectly
correct
although
symbolizing
only
a
very
general
classification
or
generalization
but
the
child
knowing
nothing
of
the
more
limited
and
detailed
classification
begins
to
generalize
regarding
the
animal
to
it
accordingly
an
animal
is
identical
with
the
dog
or
the
cow
the
sheep
or
the
horse
as
the
case
may
be
and
when
the
term
is
used
the
child
thinks
that
are
similar
to
the
particular
animal
seen
later
on
when
it
hears
the
term
animal
applied
to
a
totally
different
looking
creature
it
thinks
that
a
mistake
has
been
made
and
a
state
of
confusion
occurs
or
even
when
a
term
is
applied
within
narrower
limits
the
same
trouble
occurs
the
child
may
hear
the
term
dog
applied
to
a
mastiff
and
it
accordingly
forms
a
concept
of
identical
with
the
qualities
and
attributes
of
the
mastiff
later
hearing
the
same
term
applied
to
a
it
becomes
indignant
and
cries
out
that
the
latter
is
no
dog
but
is
something
entirely
different
it
is
not
until
the
child
becomes
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
there
are
many
kinds
of
creatures
in
the
general
category
of
dog
that
the
latter
term
becomes
fully
understood
and
its
appropriate
concept
is
intelligently
formed
thus
we
see
the
importance
of
the
step
of
presentation
in
the
same
way
the
child
might
imagine
that
because
some
particular
man
had
red
hair
and
long
whiskers
were
and
such
a
child
would
always
form
the
concept
of
man
as
a
creature
possessed
of
the
personal
qualities
just
mentioned
as
a
writer
once
said
readers
of
current
french
literature
might
imagine
that
all
englishmen
were
short
dumpy
and
irascible
and
that
all
englishwomen
had
great
teeth
and
enormous
feet
also
that
readers
of
english
literature
might
imagine
that
all
frenchmen
were
like
monkeys
and
all
frenchwomen
were
sad
coquettes
in
the
same
way
many
american
young
people
believe
that
all
englishmen
say
do
you
know
and
all
englishwomen
constantly
ejaculate
fancy
also
that
every
englishman
wears
a
monocle
in
the
same
way
the
young
english
person
from
reading
the
cheap
novels
of
his
own
country
might
well
form
the
concept
of
all
americans
as
and
saying
waal
i
want
to
know
i
reckon
and
du
tell
while
they
tilted
themselves
back
in
a
chair
with
their
feet
on
the
mantelpiece
the
concept
of
a
western
man
entertained
by
the
average
eastern
person
who
has
never
traveled
further
west
than
buffalo
is
equally
amusing
in
the
same
way
we
have
known
western
people
who
formed
a
concept
of
boston
people
as
partaking
of
a
steady
and
continuous
diet
of
baked
beans
and
studiously
reading
browning
and
emerson
between
these
meals
halleck
says
a
certain
norwegian
child
ten
years
old
had
the
quality
firmly
imbedded
in
his
concept
happening
one
day
to
see
a
negro
for
the
first
time
the
child
refused
to
call
him
a
man
until
the
negro
other
qualities
compelled
the
child
to
revise
his
concept
and
to
eliminate
whiteness
if
that
child
should
ever
see
an
indian
or
a
chinaman
the
concept
would
undergo
still
further
revision
a
girl
of
six
reared
with
an
intemperate
father
and
brothers
had
the
quality
of
firmly
fixed
in
her
concept
of
a
certain
boy
kept
until
the
age
of
eleven
in
his
concept
of
man
another
boy
until
late
in
his
teens
thought
that
man
was
a
creature
who
did
wrong
not
from
determination
but
from
ignorance
that
any
man
would
change
his
course
to
the
right
path
if
he
could
but
understand
that
he
was
going
wrong
happening
one
day
to
hear
of
a
wealthy
man
who
was
neglecting
to
provide
comforts
for
his
aged
mother
in
her
last
sickness
the
boy
concluded
that
the
man
did
not
know
his
mother
condition
when
he
informed
the
man
the
boy
was
told
to
mind
his
own
business
the
same
day
he
heard
of
some
politicians
who
had
intentionally
cheated
the
city
in
letting
a
contract
and
he
immediately
revised
his
concept
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
most
of
our
concepts
are
subject
to
change
during
our
entire
life
that
at
first
they
are
made
only
in
a
tentative
way
that
experience
may
show
us
at
any
time
that
they
have
been
erroneously
formed
that
we
have
abstracted
too
little
or
too
much
made
this
class
too
wide
or
too
narrow
or
that
here
a
quality
must
be
added
or
there
one
taken
away
let
us
now
consider
the
mental
processes
involved
in
the
formation
and
use
of
a
concept
we
have
first
as
we
have
seen
the
presentation
of
the
crude
material
from
which
the
concept
must
be
formed
our
attention
being
attracted
to
or
directed
toward
an
object
we
notice
its
qualities
and
properties
then
we
begin
a
process
of
comparison
of
the
object
perceived
or
of
our
perception
of
it
we
compare
the
object
with
other
objects
or
ideas
in
our
mind
noting
similarities
and
differences
and
thereby
leading
towards
classification
with
similar
objects
and
opposed
dissimilar
ones
the
greater
the
range
of
other
objects
previously
perceived
the
greater
will
be
the
number
of
relations
established
between
the
new
object
or
idea
and
others
as
we
advance
in
experience
and
knowledge
the
web
of
related
objects
and
ideas
becomes
more
intricate
and
complex
the
relations
attaching
to
the
child
concept
of
horse
is
very
much
simpler
than
the
concept
of
the
experienced
adult
then
we
pass
on
to
the
step
of
analysis
in
which
we
separate
the
qualities
of
the
object
and
consider
them
in
detail
the
act
of
abstraction
is
an
analytical
process
then
we
pass
on
to
the
step
of
synthesis
in
which
we
unite
the
materials
gathered
by
comparison
and
analysis
and
thus
form
a
general
idea
or
concept
regarding
the
object
in
this
process
we
combine
the
various
qualities
discerned
by
comparison
and
analysis
and
grouping
them
together
as
in
a
bundle
we
tie
them
together
with
the
string
of
synthesis
and
thus
have
a
true
general
conception
thus
from
the
first
general
conception
of
as
a
simple
thing
we
notice
first
that
the
animal
has
certain
qualities
lacking
in
other
things
and
certain
others
similar
to
other
things
then
we
analyze
the
various
qualities
of
the
horse
recognized
through
comparison
until
we
have
a
clear
and
distinct
idea
of
the
various
parts
qualities
and
properties
of
the
horse
then
we
synthesize
and
joining
together
these
various
conceptions
of
the
said
qualities
we
at
last
form
a
clear
general
concept
of
horse
as
he
with
all
his
qualities
of
course
if
we
later
discover
other
qualities
attached
to
the
horse
we
add
these
to
our
general
synthesized
concept
our
concept
of
is
enlarged
of
course
these
various
steps
in
the
formation
and
use
of
a
concept
are
not
realized
as
distinct
acts
in
the
consciousness
for
the
processes
are
largely
instinctive
and
subconscious
particularly
in
the
case
of
the
experienced
individual
the
subconscious
or
habit
mind
usually
attends
to
these
details
for
us
except
in
instances
in
which
we
deliberately
apply
the
will
to
the
task
as
in
cases
of
close
study
in
which
we
take
the
process
from
the
region
of
the
involuntary
and
place
it
in
the
voluntary
category
so
closely
related
and
blended
are
these
various
steps
of
the
process
that
some
authorities
have
disputed
vigorously
upon
the
question
as
to
which
of
the
two
steps
comparison
or
analysis
precedes
the
other
some
have
claimed
that
analysis
must
precede
comparison
else
how
could
one
compare
without
having
first
analyzed
the
things
to
be
compared
others
hold
that
comparison
must
precede
analysis
else
how
could
one
note
a
quality
unless
he
had
his
attention
drawn
to
it
by
its
resemblance
to
or
difference
from
qualities
in
other
objects
the
truth
seems
to
lie
between
the
two
ideas
for
in
some
cases
there
seems
to
be
a
perception
of
some
similarity
or
difference
before
any
analysis
or
abstraction
takes
place
while
in
others
there
seems
to
be
an
analysis
or
abstraction
before
comparison
is
possible
in
this
book
we
have
followed
the
arrangement
favored
by
the
latest
authorities
but
the
question
is
still
an
open
one
to
many
minds
as
we
have
seen
the
general
concept
once
having
been
formed
the
mind
proceeds
to
classify
the
concept
with
others
having
general
qualities
in
common
and
likewise
it
proceeds
to
generalize
from
the
classification
assuming
certain
qualities
in
certain
classes
then
we
proceed
to
make
still
further
generalizations
and
classifications
on
an
ascending
and
widening
scale
including
seeming
resemblances
less
marked
until
finally
we
embrace
the
object
with
other
objects
in
as
large
a
class
as
possible
as
well
as
in
as
close
and
limited
a
as
possible
as
brooks
says
generalization
is
an
ascending
process
the
broader
concept
is
regarded
as
higher
than
the
narrower
concept
a
concept
is
considered
higher
than
a
percept
a
general
idea
stands
above
a
particular
idea
we
thus
go
up
from
particulars
to
generals
from
percepts
to
concepts
from
lower
concepts
to
higher
concepts
beginning
down
with
particular
objects
we
rise
from
them
to
the
general
idea
of
their
class
having
formed
a
number
of
lower
classes
we
compare
them
as
we
did
individuals
and
generalize
them
into
higher
classes
we
perform
the
same
process
with
these
higher
classes
and
thus
proceed
until
we
are
at
last
arrested
in
the
highest
class
having
reached
the
pinnacle
of
generalization
we
may
descend
the
ladder
by
reversing
the
process
through
which
we
ascend
from
this
process
of
generalization
or
synthesis
we
create
from
our
simple
concepts
our
some
of
the
older
authorities
distinguished
between
these
two
classes
by
terming
the
former
conceptions
and
reserving
the
term
concepts
for
the
general
concepts
brooks
says
of
this
the
products
of
generalization
are
general
ideas
called
we
have
already
discussed
the
method
of
forming
conceptions
and
now
consider
the
nature
of
the
concept
itself
a
concept
is
a
general
idea
it
is
a
general
notion
which
has
in
it
all
that
is
common
to
its
own
class
it
is
a
general
scheme
which
embraces
all
the
individuals
of
the
class
while
it
resembles
in
all
respects
none
of
its
class
thus
my
conception
of
a
has
in
it
all
animals
but
it
does
not
correspond
in
all
respects
to
any
particular
animals
my
conception
of
a
embraces
all
triangles
but
does
not
agree
in
details
with
any
particular
triangle
the
general
conception
can
not
be
made
to
fit
exactly
any
particular
object
but
it
teems
with
many
particulars
these
points
may
be
illustrated
with
the
concepts
etc
so
we
may
begin
to
perceive
the
distinction
and
difference
between
a
and
a
this
distinction
and
the
fact
that
concept
can
not
be
is
generally
difficult
for
the
beginner
it
is
important
that
one
should
have
a
clear
and
distinct
understanding
regarding
this
point
and
so
we
shall
consider
it
further
in
the
following
chapter
chapter
concepts
and
images
as
we
have
said
a
concept
can
not
be
imaged
can
not
be
used
as
the
subject
of
a
mental
image
this
statement
is
perplexing
to
the
student
who
has
been
accustomed
to
the
idea
that
every
conception
of
the
mind
is
capable
of
being
reproduced
in
the
form
of
a
mental
image
but
the
apparently
paradoxical
statement
is
seen
as
quite
simple
when
a
little
consideration
is
given
to
it
for
instance
you
have
a
distinct
general
concept
of
you
know
what
you
mean
when
you
say
or
think
you
recognize
an
animal
when
you
see
one
and
you
understand
what
is
meant
when
another
uses
the
word
in
conversation
but
you
can
not
form
a
mental
image
of
the
concept
why
because
any
mental
image
you
might
form
would
be
either
a
picture
of
particular
or
else
a
composite
of
the
qualities
of
several
animals
your
concept
is
too
broad
and
general
to
allow
of
a
composite
picture
of
and
in
truth
your
concept
is
a
picture
of
anything
that
actually
in
one
particular
but
an
abstract
idea
embracing
the
qualities
of
all
animals
it
is
like
the
algebraic
a
symbol
for
something
that
exists
but
not
the
thing
itself
as
brooks
says
a
concept
can
not
be
represented
by
a
concrete
image
this
is
evident
from
its
being
general
rather
than
particular
if
its
color
size
or
shape
is
fixed
by
an
image
it
is
no
longer
general
but
particular
and
halleck
says
it
is
impossible
to
image
anything
without
giving
that
image
individual
marks
the
best
mental
images
are
so
definite
that
a
picture
could
be
painted
from
them
a
being
might
come
under
the
class
and
have
a
snub
nose
blonde
hair
scanty
eyebrows
and
no
scar
on
his
face
the
presence
of
one
of
these
individual
peculiarities
in
the
concept
would
destroy
it
if
we
form
an
image
of
an
apple
it
must
be
either
of
a
yellow
red
green
or
russet
apple
either
as
large
as
a
pippin
or
as
small
as
a
a
boy
was
asked
what
he
thought
of
when
was
mentioned
he
replied
that
he
thought
of
big
apple
with
a
bad
spot
on
one
side
near
the
top
that
boy
could
image
distinctly
but
his
power
of
forming
concepts
was
still
in
its
infancy
so
we
see
that
while
a
mental
image
must
picture
the
particular
and
individual
qualities
properties
and
appearances
of
some
particular
unit
of
a
class
a
can
and
must
contain
only
the
that
is
the
qualities
belonging
to
the
entire
class
the
general
concept
is
as
has
been
said
a
general
idea
a
general
notion
which
has
in
it
all
that
is
common
to
its
own
class
and
it
follows
that
a
general
idea
of
this
kind
can
not
be
pictured
a
picture
must
be
of
some
particular
thing
while
a
concept
is
something
above
and
higher
than
particular
things
we
may
picture
but
we
can
not
picture
man
the
concept
of
the
race
a
concept
is
not
a
reproduction
of
the
image
of
a
but
on
the
contrary
is
idea
of
a
class
of
we
trust
that
the
student
will
consider
this
point
until
he
arrives
at
a
clear
understanding
of
the
distinction
and
the
reason
thereof
but
while
a
concept
is
incapable
of
being
pictured
mentally
as
an
image
it
is
true
that
particular
representative
of
a
may
be
held
in
the
mind
or
imagination
as
idealized
as
a
general
representative
of
the
class
when
we
speak
or
think
of
the
general
term
or
concept
providing
that
its
real
relation
to
the
concept
is
recognized
these
idealized
objects
however
are
not
concepts
they
are
reproduced
by
the
memory
it
is
important
however
to
all
who
wish
to
convey
their
thought
plainly
that
they
be
able
to
convert
their
concepts
into
idealized
representative
objects
otherwise
they
tend
to
become
too
idealistic
and
abstract
for
common
comprehension
as
halleck
well
says
we
should
in
all
cases
be
ready
to
translate
our
concepts
when
occasion
requires
into
the
images
of
those
individuals
which
the
concept
represents
a
concept
means
nothing
except
in
reference
to
certain
individuals
without
them
it
could
never
have
had
existence
and
they
are
entitled
to
representation
a
man
who
can
not
translate
his
concepts
into
definite
images
of
the
proper
objects
is
fitted
neither
to
teach
preach
nor
practice
any
profession
there
was
not
long
ago
a
man
very
fond
of
talking
about
in
the
abstract
but
he
failed
to
recognize
an
individual
cranberry
when
it
was
placed
before
him
a
humorist
remarked
that
a
certain
metaphysician
had
such
a
love
for
abstractions
and
such
an
intense
dislike
for
concrete
things
as
to
refuse
to
eat
a
concrete
peach
when
placed
before
him
in
the
beginning
many
students
are
perplexed
regarding
the
difference
between
a
and
a
the
distinction
is
simple
when
properly
considered
a
percept
is
the
object
of
an
act
of
perception
that
which
is
perceived
a
concept
is
a
mental
representation
brooks
makes
the
following
distinction
a
is
the
mental
product
of
a
real
thing
a
is
a
mere
idea
or
notion
of
the
common
attributes
of
things
a
represents
some
particular
object
a
is
not
particular
but
general
a
can
be
described
by
particulars
a
can
be
described
only
by
generals
the
former
can
usually
be
represented
by
an
image
the
latter
can
not
be
imagined
can
only
be
thus
one
is
able
to
image
the
of
a
particular
horse
which
has
been
perceived
but
he
is
unable
to
image
correctly
the
concept
of
as
a
class
or
generic
term
in
connection
with
this
distinction
between
and
we
may
as
well
consider
the
subject
of
a
term
favored
by
many
modern
psychologists
although
others
steadfastly
decline
to
recognize
its
necessity
or
meaning
and
refuse
to
employ
it
apperception
may
be
defined
as
perception
accompanied
by
comprehension
perception
accompanied
by
recognition
the
thing
perceived
is
held
to
be
comprehended
or
recognized
that
is
in
a
new
by
reason
of
certain
previously
acquired
ideas
in
the
mind
halleck
explains
it
as
the
perception
of
things
in
relation
to
the
ideas
which
we
already
possess
it
follows
that
all
individuals
possessed
of
equally
active
organs
of
perception
and
equally
active
attention
will
perceive
the
same
thing
in
the
same
way
and
in
the
same
degree
but
the
of
each
individual
will
differ
and
vary
according
to
his
previous
experience
and
training
temperament
and
taste
habit
and
custom
for
instance
the
familiar
story
of
the
boy
who
climbed
a
tree
and
watched
the
noting
their
comments
the
first
noticing
the
tree
says
aloud
that
would
make
a
good
stick
of
timber
good
morning
carpenter
said
the
boy
the
next
man
said
that
tree
has
fine
bark
good
morning
tanner
said
the
boy
another
said
i
bet
there
a
squirrel
nest
up
in
that
tree
good
morning
hunter
said
the
boy
the
woman
sees
in
a
bird
something
pretty
and
cunning
the
hunter
sees
in
it
something
to
kill
the
ornithologist
sees
it
as
something
of
a
certain
genus
and
species
and
perhaps
also
as
something
appropriate
for
his
collection
the
farmer
perceives
it
to
be
something
destructive
of
either
insects
or
crops
a
thief
sees
a
jail
as
something
to
be
dreaded
an
ordinary
citizen
something
useful
for
confining
objectionable
people
a
policeman
something
in
the
line
of
his
business
and
so
on
the
apperception
differing
upon
the
previous
experience
of
the
individual
in
the
same
way
the
scientist
sees
in
an
animal
or
rock
many
qualities
of
which
the
ordinary
person
is
ignorant
our
training
experience
prejudices
affect
our
apperception
and
so
we
see
that
in
a
measure
our
are
determined
not
only
by
our
simple
perceptions
but
also
materially
by
our
apperceptions
we
conceive
things
not
only
as
they
are
apparent
to
our
senses
but
also
as
colored
and
influenced
by
our
previous
impressions
and
ideas
for
this
reason
we
find
widely
varying
concepts
of
the
same
things
among
different
individuals
only
an
absolute
mind
could
form
an
absolute
concept
chapter
vi
terms
in
logic
the
words
and
are
practically
identical
but
in
the
popular
usage
of
the
terms
there
is
a
distinct
difference
this
difference
is
warranted
if
we
depart
from
the
theoretical
phase
of
logic
for
the
word
really
denotes
an
in
the
mind
while
the
word
really
denotes
a
or
name
of
an
idea
or
concept
the
symbol
of
the
latter
in
a
previous
chapter
we
have
seen
that
denomination
or
the
act
of
naming
or
designating
by
a
name
is
the
final
step
or
stage
in
forming
a
concept
and
it
is
a
fact
that
the
majority
of
the
words
in
the
languages
of
civilized
people
denote
general
ideas
or
concepts
as
brooks
says
to
give
each
individual
or
particular
idea
a
name
peculiar
to
itself
would
be
impracticable
and
indeed
impossible
the
mind
would
soon
become
overwhelmed
with
its
burden
of
names
nearly
all
the
ordinary
words
of
our
language
are
general
rather
than
particular
the
individuals
distinguished
by
particular
names
excepting
persons
and
places
are
comparatively
few
most
objects
are
named
only
by
common
nouns
nearly
all
of
our
verbs
express
general
actions
our
adjectives
denote
common
qualities
and
our
adverbs
designate
classes
of
actions
and
qualities
there
are
very
few
words
in
the
language
besides
the
names
of
persons
and
places
that
do
not
express
general
ideas
in
logic
the
word
is
employed
to
denote
word
or
words
which
constitute
a
the
word
is
employed
strictly
in
the
sense
of
subject
of
without
reference
to
the
words
symbolizing
it
the
or
subject
of
thought
is
the
important
element
or
fact
and
the
denoting
it
is
merely
a
convenient
symbol
of
expression
it
must
be
remembered
that
a
does
not
necessarily
consists
of
but
a
single
word
for
often
many
words
are
employed
to
denote
the
concept
sometimes
even
an
entire
clause
or
phrase
being
found
necessary
for
the
current
for
the
purpose
of
the
consideration
of
the
subjects
to
be
treated
upon
in
this
book
we
may
agree
that
term
is
the
outward
symbol
of
a
and
that
concept
is
the
idea
expressed
by
the
there
are
three
general
parts
or
phases
of
deductive
logic
namely
terms
propositions
and
syllogisms
therefore
in
considering
terms
we
are
entering
into
a
consideration
of
the
first
phase
of
deductive
logic
unless
we
have
a
correct
understanding
of
terms
we
can
not
expect
to
understand
the
succeeding
stages
of
deductive
reasoning
as
jevons
says
when
we
join
terms
together
we
make
a
proposition
when
we
join
propositions
together
we
make
an
argument
or
piece
of
reasoning
we
should
generally
get
nothing
but
nonsense
if
we
were
to
put
together
any
terms
and
any
propositions
and
to
suppose
that
we
were
reasoning
to
produce
a
good
argument
we
must
be
careful
to
obey
certain
rules
which
it
is
the
purpose
of
logic
to
make
known
but
in
order
to
understand
the
matter
perfectly
ought
first
to
learn
exactly
what
a
term
is
and
how
many
kinds
of
terms
there
may
we
have
next
to
learn
the
nature
of
a
proposition
and
the
different
kinds
of
propositions
afterwards
we
shall
learn
how
one
proposition
may
by
reasoning
be
drawn
from
other
propositions
in
the
kind
of
argument
called
the
syllogism
now
having
seen
that
terms
are
the
outward
symbols
or
expression
of
concepts
and
are
the
names
of
things
which
we
join
together
in
a
proposition
let
us
proceed
to
consider
the
different
kinds
of
terms
following
the
classifications
adopted
by
the
authorities
a
may
contain
any
number
of
nouns
substantive
or
adjective
or
it
may
contain
but
a
single
noun
thus
in
tigers
are
ferocious
the
first
term
is
the
single
substantive
tigers
the
second
term
is
the
single
adjective
ferocious
and
in
the
proposition
the
king
of
england
is
the
emperor
of
india
there
are
two
terms
each
composed
of
two
nouns
king
of
england
being
the
first
term
and
emperor
of
india
being
the
second
term
the
proposition
the
library
of
the
british
museum
is
the
greatest
collection
of
books
in
the
world
contains
fifteen
words
but
two
the
first
term
being
the
library
of
the
british
museum
in
which
are
two
substantives
one
adjective
two
definite
articles
and
one
preposition
the
second
term
being
the
greatest
collection
of
books
in
the
world
which
contains
three
substantives
one
adjective
two
articles
and
two
prepositions
the
above
illustration
is
supplied
by
jevons
who
adds
a
logical
term
then
may
consist
of
any
number
of
nouns
substantive
or
adjective
with
the
articles
prepositions
and
conjunctions
required
to
join
them
together
still
is
only
one
term
if
it
points
out
or
makes
us
think
of
a
single
object
or
collection
or
class
of
a
substantive
is
the
part
of
speech
which
expresses
something
that
exists
either
material
or
immaterial
the
first
classification
of
terms
divides
them
into
two
general
classes
singular
terms
and
general
terms
a
is
a
term
denoting
a
single
object
person
or
thing
although
denoting
only
a
single
object
person
or
thing
it
may
be
composed
of
several
words
or
it
may
be
composed
of
but
one
word
as
in
the
case
of
a
proper
name
etc
the
following
are
singular
terms
because
they
are
terms
denoting
but
a
single
object
person
or
thing
europe
minnesota
socrates
shakespeare
the
first
man
the
highest
good
the
first
cause
the
king
of
england
the
british
museum
the
commissioner
of
public
works
the
main
street
of
the
city
of
new
york
it
will
be
noted
that
in
all
of
the
examples
given
the
singular
term
denotes
a
particular
something
a
specific
thing
a
something
of
which
there
is
but
one
and
that
one
possesses
particularity
and
individuality
as
hyslop
says
of
is
not
the
only
or
distinctive
feature
of
singular
terms
but
or
singularity
as
representing
a
concrete
individual
whole
a
is
a
term
which
applies
in
the
same
sense
to
each
and
every
individual
object
person
or
thing
in
a
number
of
objects
persons
or
things
of
the
same
kind
or
to
the
entire
class
composed
of
such
objects
persons
or
things
of
the
same
kind
for
instance
horse
man
biped
mammal
trees
figures
grain
of
sand
matter
etc
hyslop
says
regarding
general
terms
in
these
instances
the
terms
denote
more
than
one
object
and
apply
to
all
of
the
same
kind
their
meaning
is
important
in
the
interpretation
of
what
are
called
universal
propositions
another
general
classification
of
terms
divides
them
into
two
respective
classes
as
follows
collective
terms
and
distributive
terms
hyslop
says
of
this
classification
this
division
is
based
upon
the
distinction
between
aggregate
wholes
of
the
same
kind
and
class
terms
it
partly
coincides
with
the
division
into
singular
and
general
terms
the
latter
always
being
distributive
a
is
one
which
denotes
an
aggregate
or
collected
whole
of
objects
persons
or
things
of
the
same
or
similar
kind
collective
whole
is
considered
as
an
although
composed
of
a
totality
of
separate
individual
objects
persons
or
things
thus
the
following
terms
regiment
congregation
army
family
crowd
nation
company
battalion
class
congress
parliament
convention
etc
are
collective
terms
because
they
denote
collective
aggregate
or
composite
wholes
considered
as
an
individual
a
is
a
term
which
denotes
and
every
individual
object
person
or
thing
in
a
given
for
example
are
the
terms
man
quadruped
biped
mammal
book
diamond
tree
as
hyslop
says
general
terms
are
always
distributive
also
it
is
important
also
to
keep
clear
the
distinction
between
wholes
and
wholes
they
are
often
confused
so
as
to
call
a
term
denoting
a
a
collective
term
another
general
classification
of
terms
divides
them
into
the
following
two
respective
classes
concrete
terms
and
abstract
terms
a
is
a
term
denoting
either
a
definite
object
person
or
thing
which
is
subject
to
perception
and
experience
and
may
be
considered
as
actually
existent
concretely
as
for
instance
horse
man
mountain
dollar
knife
table
or
else
an
attribute
thought
of
and
used
solely
as
an
attribute
as
for
instance
beautiful
wise
noble
virtuous
good
etc
an
is
a
term
denoting
the
attribute
quality
or
property
as
apart
from
the
object
person
or
and
as
having
an
abstract
existence
as
for
instance
beauty
wisdom
nobility
goodness
virtue
etc
as
we
have
seen
elsewhere
these
qualities
have
no
real
existence
but
are
known
and
thought
of
only
in
connection
with
concrete
objects
persons
and
things
thus
we
can
not
know
beauty
but
may
know
we
can
not
know
virtue
but
we
may
know
virtuous
people
etc
an
or
is
when
expressed
as
an
and
when
expressed
as
a
as
for
instance
beautiful
and
beauty
respectively
or
virtuous
and
virtue
respectively
the
distinction
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
a
concrete
term
is
name
of
a
thing
or
of
a
quality
of
a
thing
expressed
as
an
adjective
and
as
merely
a
while
an
abstract
term
is
the
name
of
a
quality
of
a
thing
as
a
noun
and
as
a
thing
in
certain
terms
may
be
used
as
either
concrete
terms
or
as
abstract
terms
and
certain
authorities
have
seen
fit
to
classify
them
as
as
for
instance
the
terms
government
religion
philosophy
etc
another
general
classification
of
terms
divides
them
into
two
respective
classes
as
follows
and
a
is
a
term
which
denotes
its
own
qualities
as
for
instance
good
human
large
square
black
strong
etc
these
terms
indicate
the
presence
of
the
quality
denoted
by
the
term
itself
a
is
a
term
denoting
the
absence
of
a
quality
as
for
instance
inhuman
inorganic
unwell
unpleasant
etc
these
terms
the
presence
of
certain
qualities
rather
than
the
presence
of
an
opposite
quality
they
are
essentially
negative
in
nature
and
in
form
jevons
says
we
may
usually
know
a
negative
term
by
its
beginning
with
one
of
the
little
syllables
or
by
its
ending
with
hyslop
says
the
usual
symbols
of
negative
terms
are
or
and
sometimes
and
and
jevons
adds
if
the
english
language
were
a
perfect
one
every
term
ought
to
have
a
negative
term
exactly
corresponding
to
it
so
that
all
adjectives
and
nouns
would
be
in
pairs
just
as
has
its
negative
metallic
logical
illogical
and
so
on
so
blue
should
have
its
negative
literary
paper
but
many
of
these
negative
terms
would
be
seldom
or
never
used
and
if
we
happen
to
want
them
we
can
make
them
for
the
occasion
by
putting
or
before
the
positive
term
accordingly
we
find
in
the
dictionary
only
those
negative
terms
which
are
much
employed
the
last
named
authority
also
says
sometimes
the
same
word
may
seem
to
have
two
or
even
more
distinct
negatives
there
is
much
difference
between
and
that
is
in
evening
dress
both
seem
to
be
negatives
of
but
this
is
because
the
word
has
two
distinct
meanings
some
authorities
insist
upon
closer
and
further
classification
as
for
instance
in
the
case
of
what
they
call
a
denoting
the
absence
of
qualities
once
possessed
by
the
object
person
or
thing
as
deaf
dead
blind
dark
etc
hyslop
says
that
these
terms
are
positive
in
form
and
negative
in
matter
or
meaning
also
in
the
case
of
what
they
call
a
denoting
the
presence
of
a
positive
quality
expressed
in
a
negative
manner
as
disagreeable
inhuman
invaluable
etc
these
last
mentioned
classes
however
are
regarded
by
some
as
the
result
of
carrying
too
far
the
tendency
toward
classification
and
the
two
general
classes
positive
and
negative
are
thought
sufficient
for
the
purpose
of
the
general
student
the
same
objection
applies
to
a
classification
occasionally
made
that
which
is
called
an
denoting
a
term
the
intent
of
which
is
to
place
in
a
distinct
category
every
object
person
or
thing
other
than
that
expressed
in
the
corresponding
positive
term
the
intent
of
the
term
is
to
place
the
positive
idea
in
one
class
and
all
else
into
a
separate
one
examples
of
this
class
of
terms
are
found
in
unmoral
etc
hyslop
says
of
these
terms
they
are
not
always
if
ever
recognized
as
rhetorically
elegant
but
are
valuable
often
to
make
clear
the
really
negative
or
infinitatively
negative
nature
of
the
idea
in
mind
another
general
classification
of
terms
divides
them
into
two
respective
classes
as
follows
absolute
terms
and
relative
terms
an
is
a
term
denoting
the
presence
of
qualities
intrinsic
to
the
object
and
not
depending
upon
any
relation
to
any
other
object
as
for
instance
man
book
horse
gun
etc
these
terms
related
to
many
other
terms
but
are
related
to
any
other
a
is
a
term
denoting
certain
relations
to
other
terms
as
for
instance
father
son
mother
daughter
teacher
pupil
master
servant
etc
thus
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
child
except
in
relation
to
parent
or
the
one
term
implies
the
existence
of
its
related
term
hyslop
says
of
the
above
classification
relative
terms
suggest
the
thought
of
other
individuals
with
the
relation
involved
as
a
part
of
the
term
meaning
while
absolute
terms
suggest
only
the
qualities
in
the
subject
without
a
relation
to
others
being
necessarily
involved
some
authorities
also
classify
terms
as
and
also
as
and
this
classification
is
meant
to
indicate
the
content
and
extent
of
the
term
for
instance
when
we
classify
we
begin
with
the
individuals
which
we
then
group
into
a
small
class
these
classes
we
then
group
into
a
larger
class
according
to
their
resemblances
these
larger
classes
then
go
to
form
a
part
of
still
larger
classes
and
so
on
as
these
classes
advance
they
form
terms
and
as
we
retreat
from
the
general
class
into
the
less
general
and
more
particular
the
term
becomes
by
some
the
term
which
includes
the
narrower
is
called
the
and
the
narrower
are
called
the
thus
would
be
a
higher
and
broader
term
than
dog
cat
or
tiger
because
it
includes
the
latter
brooks
says
since
a
concept
is
formed
by
the
union
of
the
common
attributes
of
individuals
it
thus
embraces
both
attributes
and
individuals
the
attributes
of
a
concept
constitute
what
is
called
its
the
individuals
it
embraces
constitute
its
accordingly
the
feature
of
including
objects
in
a
concept
or
term
is
called
its
while
the
feature
of
including
attributes
or
qualities
is
called
its
intension
it
follows
as
a
natural
consequence
that
the
greater
the
of
a
term
the
less
its
the
greater
its
the
less
its
we
will
understand
this
more
clearly
when
we
consider
that
the
more
individuals
contained
in
a
term
the
fewer
properties
or
qualities
it
can
contain
and
the
more
common
properties
the
fewer
individuals
as
brooks
says
the
concept
has
more
than
or
since
it
embraces
more
individuals
and
less
since
we
must
lay
aside
the
distinctive
attributes
of
poet
orator
and
statesman
in
order
to
unite
them
in
a
common
class
in
the
same
way
the
general
term
is
quite
extended
for
it
includes
a
large
number
of
individual
varieties
of
very
different
and
varied
characteristics
and
qualities
as
for
instance
the
lion
camel
dog
oyster
elephant
snail
worm
snake
etc
accordingly
its
intension
must
be
small
for
it
can
include
only
the
qualities
common
to
all
animals
which
are
very
few
indeed
the
definition
of
the
term
shows
how
small
is
its
as
an
organic
being
rising
above
a
vegetable
in
various
respects
especially
in
possessing
sensibility
will
and
the
power
of
voluntary
motion
another
narrows
the
intension
still
further
when
he
defines
as
a
creature
which
possesses
or
has
possessed
life
halleck
says
is
very
narrow
in
intension
very
broad
in
extension
there
are
few
qualities
common
to
all
animals
but
there
is
a
vast
number
of
animals
to
give
the
full
meaning
of
the
term
in
we
should
have
to
name
every
animal
from
the
microscopic
infusoria
to
the
tiger
from
the
angleworm
to
the
whale
when
we
decrease
the
extension
to
one
species
of
animal
the
individuals
are
fewer
the
qualities
more
numerous
the
importance
of
forming
clear
and
distinct
concepts
and
of
grouping
classifying
and
generalizing
these
into
larger
and
broader
concepts
and
terms
is
recognized
by
all
authorities
and
is
generally
regarded
as
forming
the
real
basis
of
all
constructive
thought
as
brooks
says
generalization
lies
at
the
basis
of
language
only
as
man
can
form
general
conceptions
is
it
possible
for
him
to
form
a
language
nearly
all
the
ordinary
words
in
our
language
are
general
rather
than
particular
this
power
of
generalization
lies
also
at
the
basis
of
science
had
we
no
power
of
forming
general
ideas
each
particular
object
would
be
a
study
by
itself
and
we
should
thus
never
pass
beyond
the
very
alphabet
of
knowledge
judgments
except
in
the
simplest
form
would
be
impossible
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
even
the
simplest
form
of
the
syllogism
could
be
constructed
no
general
conclusion
could
be
drawn
from
particulars
nor
particular
conclusions
from
generals
and
thus
neither
inductive
nor
deductive
reasoning
would
be
possible
the
classifications
of
science
could
not
be
made
and
knowledge
would
end
at
the
very
threshold
of
science
chapter
vii
the
meaning
of
terms
every
term
has
its
or
as
some
authorities
prefer
to
call
it
the
word
or
words
of
which
the
term
is
composed
are
merely
vocal
sounds
serving
as
a
symbol
for
the
real
of
the
term
which
exists
only
in
the
mind
of
the
person
understanding
it
to
one
not
understanding
the
meaning
of
the
term
the
latter
is
but
as
a
meaningless
sound
but
to
one
understanding
it
the
sound
awakens
mental
associations
and
representation
and
thus
serves
its
purpose
as
a
symbol
of
thought
each
concrete
general
term
has
two
the
actual
concrete
thing
person
or
object
to
which
the
term
is
applied
and
the
qualities
attributes
or
properties
of
those
objects
persons
or
things
in
consequence
of
which
the
term
is
applied
for
instance
in
the
case
of
the
concrete
term
the
first
meaning
consists
of
the
general
idea
of
the
thing
which
we
think
of
as
and
the
second
meaning
consists
of
the
various
qualities
which
go
to
make
that
thing
a
book
as
the
printed
pages
the
binding
the
form
the
cover
etc
not
only
is
that
particular
thing
but
every
other
thing
having
the
same
or
similar
properties
also
must
be
and
so
whenever
i
call
a
thing
it
must
possess
the
said
qualities
and
whenever
i
combine
the
ideas
of
these
qualities
in
thought
i
must
think
of
as
jevons
says
in
reality
every
ordinary
general
term
has
a
double
meaning
it
means
the
things
to
which
it
is
applied
it
also
means
in
a
totally
different
way
the
qualities
and
peculiarities
as
being
in
the
things
logicians
say
that
the
number
of
things
to
which
a
term
applies
is
the
of
the
term
while
the
number
of
qualities
or
peculiarities
implied
is
the
the
extension
and
intension
of
terms
has
been
referred
to
in
the
previous
chapter
the
general
classification
of
the
degrees
of
of
a
general
term
is
expressed
by
the
two
terms
and
respectively
the
classification
of
the
character
of
the
of
a
term
is
expressed
by
the
term
and
respectively
is
a
term
indicating
a
class
of
objects
containing
several
species
a
class
more
extensive
than
a
species
a
universal
which
is
predicable
of
several
things
of
different
species
is
a
term
denoting
a
smaller
class
of
objects
than
a
genus
and
of
two
or
more
of
which
a
genus
is
composed
a
predicable
that
expresses
the
whole
essence
of
its
subject
in
so
far
as
any
common
term
can
express
it
an
authority
says
the
names
and
are
merely
relative
and
the
same
common
term
may
in
one
case
be
the
species
which
is
predicated
of
an
individual
and
in
another
case
the
individual
of
which
a
species
is
predicated
thus
the
individual
george
belongs
to
the
logical
species
man
while
man
is
an
individual
of
the
logical
species
animal
jevons
says
it
is
desirable
to
have
names
by
which
to
show
that
one
class
is
contained
in
another
and
accordingly
we
call
the
class
which
is
divided
into
two
or
more
smaller
ones
the
and
the
smaller
ones
into
which
it
is
divided
the
is
a
of
which
is
a
while
in
turn
is
a
of
which
is
a
and
in
turn
becomes
a
of
which
becomes
a
species
the
student
must
avoid
confusing
the
meaning
of
the
terms
and
with
the
use
of
the
same
terms
in
natural
history
class
is
a
genus
to
the
class
below
it
in
extension
and
each
class
is
a
species
to
the
class
above
it
in
at
the
lowest
extreme
of
the
scale
we
reach
what
is
called
the
which
can
not
be
further
subdivided
as
for
instance
socrates
this
lowest
species
must
always
be
an
individual
object
person
or
thing
at
the
highest
extreme
of
the
scale
we
reach
what
is
or
highest
genus
which
is
never
a
species
of
anything
for
there
is
no
class
higher
than
it
as
for
instance
being
existence
reality
truth
the
absolute
the
infinite
the
ultimate
etc
hyslop
says
in
reality
there
is
but
one
while
there
may
be
an
indefinite
number
of
all
intermediate
terms
between
these
extremes
are
sometimes
called
as
being
either
genera
or
species
according
to
the
relation
in
which
they
are
viewed
passing
on
to
the
classification
of
the
character
of
the
of
terms
we
find
a
term
denoting
the
mark
or
marks
by
which
the
species
is
distinguished
from
the
rest
of
the
genus
the
specific
characteristic
thus
the
color
of
the
skin
is
a
between
the
negro
and
the
caucasian
the
number
of
feet
the
between
the
biped
and
the
quadruped
the
form
and
shape
of
leaves
the
between
the
oak
and
the
elm
trees
etc
hyslop
says
whatever
distinguishes
one
object
from
another
can
be
called
the
it
is
some
characteristic
in
addition
to
the
common
qualities
and
determines
the
species
or
individual
under
the
genus
a
term
denoting
a
peculiar
quality
of
anything
that
which
is
inherent
in
or
naturally
essential
to
anything
thus
a
is
a
distinguishing
mark
of
a
class
thus
black
skin
is
a
of
the
negro
race
four
feet
a
of
quadrupeds
a
certain
form
of
leaf
a
of
the
oak
tree
thus
a
between
two
species
may
be
a
of
one
of
the
species
a
term
denoting
any
quality
or
circumstance
which
may
or
may
not
belong
to
a
class
accidentally
as
it
were
or
whatever
does
not
really
constitute
an
essential
part
of
an
object
person
or
thing
as
for
instance
the
redness
of
a
rose
for
a
rose
might
part
with
its
redness
and
still
be
a
rose
the
color
is
the
of
the
rose
or
a
brick
may
be
white
and
still
be
a
brick
although
the
majority
of
bricks
are
red
the
redness
or
whiteness
of
the
brick
are
its
and
not
its
essential
whately
says
in
logic
are
of
two
kinds
separable
and
inseparable
if
walking
be
the
of
a
particular
man
it
is
a
separable
one
for
he
would
not
cease
to
be
that
man
though
he
stood
still
while
on
the
contrary
if
spaniard
is
the
connected
with
him
it
is
an
inseparable
one
since
he
never
can
cease
to
be
ethnologically
considered
what
he
was
born
arising
from
the
classification
of
the
meaning
or
content
of
terms
we
find
the
process
termed
definition
is
a
term
denoting
an
explanation
of
a
word
or
term
in
logic
the
term
is
used
to
denote
the
process
of
analysis
in
which
the
and
of
a
term
are
clearly
stated
there
are
of
course
several
kinds
of
definitions
for
instance
there
is
what
is
called
a
which
whately
defines
as
a
definition
which
explains
the
nature
of
the
thing
by
a
particular
name
there
is
also
what
is
called
a
which
is
a
definition
made
by
enumerating
such
parts
as
are
actually
separable
such
as
the
hull
masts
of
a
ship
also
a
which
is
a
definition
consisting
of
the
genus
and
the
difference
thus
if
a
planet
be
defined
as
wandering
star
is
the
genus
and
points
out
the
difference
between
a
planet
and
an
ordinary
star
an
is
a
definition
of
the
qualities
of
a
thing
an
is
a
definition
of
the
essential
and
of
an
object
person
or
thing
crabbe
discriminates
between
a
definition
and
an
explanation
as
follows
a
is
correct
or
precise
an
is
general
or
ample
the
of
a
word
defines
or
limits
the
extent
of
its
signification
it
is
the
rule
for
the
scholar
in
the
use
of
any
word
the
of
a
word
may
include
both
definition
and
illustration
the
former
admits
of
no
more
words
than
will
include
the
leading
features
in
the
meaning
of
any
term
the
latter
admits
of
an
unlimited
scope
for
diffuseness
on
the
part
of
the
explainer
hyslop
gives
the
following
excellent
explanation
of
the
which
as
he
states
is
the
proper
meaning
of
the
term
in
logic
he
states
the
rules
which
regulate
logical
definition
are
as
follows
a
definition
should
state
the
essential
attributes
of
the
species
defined
a
definition
must
not
contain
the
name
of
word
defined
otherwise
the
definition
is
called
circulus
in
the
definition
must
be
exactly
equivalent
to
the
species
defined
a
definition
should
not
be
expressed
in
obscure
figurative
or
ambiguous
language
a
definition
must
not
be
negative
when
it
can
be
affirmative
a
correct
definition
necessarily
requires
the
manifestation
of
the
two
respective
processes
of
analysis
and
synthesis
is
a
term
denoting
the
separation
of
anything
into
its
constituent
elements
qualities
properties
and
attributes
it
is
seen
at
once
that
in
order
to
correctly
define
an
object
person
or
thing
it
is
first
necessary
to
analyze
the
latter
in
order
to
perceive
its
essential
and
accidental
properties
or
differences
unless
the
qualities
properties
and
attributes
are
clearly
and
fully
perceived
we
can
not
properly
define
the
object
itself
is
a
term
denoting
the
act
of
joining
or
putting
two
or
more
things
together
in
logic
the
method
by
composition
in
opposition
to
the
method
of
resolution
or
analysis
in
stating
a
definition
we
must
necessarily
join
together
the
various
essential
qualities
properties
and
attributes
which
we
have
discovered
by
the
process
of
analysis
and
the
synthesized
combination
considered
as
a
whole
is
the

the
object
expressed

chapter
viii
judgments
the
first
step
in
the
process
of
reasoning
is
that
of
conception
or
the
forming
of
concepts
the
second
step
is
that
of
judgment
or
the
process
of
perceiving
the
agreement
or
disagreement
of
two
conceptions
in
logic
is
defined
as
the
comparing
together
in
the
mind
of
two
notions
concepts
or
ideas
which
are
the
objects
of
apprehension
whether
complex
or
incomplex
and
pronouncing
that
they
agree
or
disagree
with
each
other
or
that
one
of
them
belongs
or
does
not
belong
to
the
other
judgment
is
therefore
affirmative
or
negative
when
we
have
in
our
mind
two
concepts
we
are
likely
to
compare
them
one
with
the
other
and
to
thus
arrive
at
a
conclusion
regarding
their
agreement
or
disagreement
this
process
of
comparison
and
decision
is
what
in
logic
is
called
in
every
act
of
judgment
there
must
be
at
least
two
concepts
to
be
examined
and
compared
this
comparison
must
lead
to
a
judgment
regarding
their
agreement
or
disagreement
for
instance
we
have
the
two
concepts
and
we
examine
and
compare
the
two
concepts
and
find
that
there
is
an
agreement
between
them
we
find
that
the
concept
is
included
in
the
higher
concept
of
and
therefore
we
assert
that
horse
is
an
this
is
a
statement
of
and
is
therefore
a
we
then
compare
the
concepts
and
and
find
a
disagreement
between
them
which
we
express
in
the
statement
of
the
judgment
that
horse
is
not
a
this
judgment
stating
a
disagreement
is
what
is
called
a
in
the
above
illustration
of
the
comparison
between
the
concepts
and
we
find
that
the
second
concept
is
broader
than
the
first
so
broad
in
fact
that
it
includes
the
latter
the
terms
are
not
equal
for
we
can
not
say
in
truth
that
an
animal
is
the
horse
we
may
however
include
a
of
the
broader
conception
with
the
narrower
and
say
some
animals
are
horses
sometimes
both
concepts
are
of
equal
rank
as
when
we
state
that
man
is
a
rational
animal
in
the
process
of
judgment
there
is
always
the
necessity
of
the
choice
between
the
positive
and
the
negative
when
we
compare
the
concepts
and
we
must
of
necessity
decide
either
that
the
horse
an
animal
or
else
that
it
is
an
animal
the
importance
of
the
process
of
judgment
is
ably
stated
by
halleck
as
follows
were
isolated
concepts
possible
they
would
be
of
very
little
use
isolated
facts
are
of
no
more
service
than
unspun
wool
we
might
have
a
concept
of
a
certain
class
of
ivy
as
we
might
also
of
poisons
unless
judgment
linked
these
two
concepts
and
decided
that
this
species
of
ivy
is
poisonous
we
might
take
hold
of
it
and
be
poisoned
we
might
have
a
concept
of
bread
and
also
one
of
meat
fruit
and
vegetables
if
we
also
had
a
concept
of
food
unrelated
to
these
we
should
starve
to
death
for
we
should
not
think
of
them
as
foods
a
vessel
supposing
itself
to
be
far
out
at
sea
signaled
another
vessel
that
the
crew
were
dying
of
thirst
that
crew
certainly
had
a
concept
of
drinkable
things
and
also
of
water
to
the
surprise
of
the
first
the
second
vessel
signaled
back
from
the
sea
and
drink
you
are
at
the
mouth
of
the
amazon
the
thirsty
crew
had
not
joined
the
concept
to
the
concept
of
water
over
the
ship
side
a
man
having
taken
an
overdose
of
laudanum
his
wife
lost
much
valuable
time
in
sending
out
for
antidotes
because
certain
of
her
concepts
had
not
been
connected
by
judgment
she
had
good
concepts
of
coffee
and
of
mustard
she
also
knew
that
an
antidote
to
opium
was
needed
but
she
had
never
linked
these
concepts
and
judged
that
coffee
and
mustard
were
antidotes
to
opium
the
moment
she
formed
that
judgment
she
was
a
wiser
woman
for
her
knowledge
was
related
and
usable
judgment
is
the
power
revolutionizing
the
world
the
revolution
is
slow
because
forces
are
so
complex
so
hard
to
be
reduced
to
their
simplest
forms
and
so
disguised
and
neutralized
by
the
presence
of
other
forces
fortunately
judgment
is
ever
silently
working
and
comparing
things
that
to
past
ages
have
seemed
dissimilar
and
it
is
continually
abstracting
and
leaving
out
of
the
field
of
view
those
qualities
which
have
simply
served
to
obscure
the
point
at
issue
judgment
may
be
both
analytic
or
synthetic
in
its
processes
and
it
may
be
neither
when
we
compare
a
narrow
concept
with
a
broader
one
as
a
part
with
a
whole
the
process
is
synthetic
or
an
act
of
combination
when
we
compare
a
part
of
a
concept
with
another
concept
the
process
is
analytic
when
we
compare
concepts
equal
in
rank
or
extent
the
process
is
neither
synthetic
nor
analytic
thus
in
the
statement
that
a
horse
is
an
animal
the
judgment
is
synthetic
in
the
statement
that
some
animals
are
horses
the
judgement
is
analytic
in
the
statement
that
a
man
is
a
rational
animal
the
judgment
is
neither
analytic
nor
synthetic
brooks
says
in
one
sense
all
judgments
are
synthetic
a
judgment
consists
of
the
union
of
two
ideas
and
this
uniting
is
a
process
of
synthesis
this
however
is
a
superficial
view
of
the
process
such
a
synthesis
is
a
mere
mechanical
synthesis
below
this
is
a
which
is
sometimes
analytic
sometimes
synthetic
and
sometimes
neither
analytic
nor
synthetic
the
same
authority
states
the
act
of
mind
described
is
what
is
known
as
strictly
speaking
however
every
intelligent
act
of
the
mind
is
accompanied
with
a
to
know
is
to
discriminate
and
therefore
to
judge
every
sensation
or
cognition
involves
a
knowledge
and
so
a
judgment
that
it
exists
the
mind
can
not
think
at
all
without
judging
to
think
is
to
judge
in
forming
the
notions
which
judgment
compares
the
mind
every
notion
or
concept
implies
a
previous
act
of
judgment
to
form
it
in
forming
a
concept
we
compare
the
common
attributes
before
we
unite
them
and
comparison
is
judgment
it
is
thus
true
that
concept
is
a
contracted
judgment
every
judgment
an
expanded
concept
this
kind
of
judgment
by
which
we
affirm
the
existence
of
states
of
consciousness
discriminate
qualities
distinguish
percepts
and
form
concepts
is
called
or
psychological
in
logical
judgment
there
are
two
aspects
judgment
by
extension
and
judgment
by
intension
when
we
compare
the
two
concepts
and
we
find
that
the
concept
is
contained
in
the
concept
and
the
judgment
that
horse
is
an
may
be
considered
as
a
judgment
by
extension
in
the
same
comparison
we
see
that
the
concept
contains
the
of
and
in
attributing
this
quality
to
the
we
may
also
say
horse
is
an
which
judgment
may
be
considered
as
a
judgment
by
intension
brooks
says
both
views
of
judgment
are
correct
the
mind
may
reach
its
judgment
either
by
extension
or
by
intension
the
method
by
extension
is
usually
the
more
natural
when
a
judgment
is
expressed
in
words
it
is
called
a
proposition
there
is
some
confusion
regarding
the
two
terms
some
holding
that
a
judgment
and
a
proposition
are
identical
and
that
the
term
proposition
may
be
properly
used
to
indicate
the
judgment
itself
but
the
authorities
who
seek
for
clearness
of
expression
and
thought
now
generally
hold
that
proposition
is
a
judgment
expressed
in
in
the
next
chapter
in
which
we
consider
propositions
we
shall
enter
into
a
more
extended
consideration
of
the
subject
of
judgments
as
expressed
in
propositions
which
consideration
we
omit
at
this
point
in
order
to
avoid
repetition
just
as
the
respective
subjects
of
concepts
and
terms
necessarily
blend
into
each
other
so
do
the
respective
subjects
of
judgments
and
propositions
in
each
case
too
there
is
the
element
of
the
mental
process
on
the
one
hand
and
the
verbal
expression
of
it
on
the
other
hand
it
will
be
well
to
keep
this
fact
in
mind
chapter
ix
propositions
we
have
seen
that
the
first
step
of
deductive
reasoning
is
that
which
we
call
concepts
the
second
step
is
that
which
we
call
propositions
in
logic
a
is
a
sentence
or
part
of
a
sentence
affirming
or
denying
a
connection
between
the
terms
limited
to
express
assertions
rather
than
extended
to
questions
and
commands
hyslop
defines
a
proposition
as
any
affirmation
or
denial
of
an
agreement
between
two
conceptions
of
are
found
in
the
following
sentences
the
rose
is
a
flower
a
horse
is
an
animal
chicago
is
a
city
all
of
which
are
affirmations
of
agreement
between
the
two
terms
involved
also
in
a
horse
is
not
a
zebra
pinks
are
not
roses
the
whale
is
not
a
fish
which
are
denials
of
agreement
between
the
terms
the
of
a
are
the
or
that
of
which
something
is
affirmed
or
denied
the
or
which
is
affirmed
or
denied
regarding
the
and
the
or
the
verb
serving
as
a
link
between
the
subject
and
the
predicate
in
the
proposition
man
is
an
animal
the
term
is
the
subject
the
term
is
the
predicate
and
the
word
is
the
copula
the
copula
is
always
some
form
of
the
verb
in
the
present
tense
indicative
in
an
affirmative
proposition
and
the
same
with
the
negative
particle
affixed
in
a
negative
proposition
the
copula
is
not
always
directly
expressed
by
the
word
or
but
is
instead
expressed
in
some
phrase
which
implies
them
for
instance
we
say
he
runs
which
implies
he
is
running
in
the
same
way
it
may
appear
at
times
as
if
the
predicate
was
missing
as
in
god
is
by
which
is
meant
god
is
existing
in
some
cases
the
proposition
is
inverted
the
predicate
appearing
first
in
order
and
the
subject
last
as
in
blessed
are
the
peacemakers
or
strong
is
truth
in
such
cases
judgment
must
be
used
in
determining
the
matter
in
accordance
with
the
character
and
meaning
of
the
terms
an
is
one
in
which
the
predicate
is
to
agree
with
the
subject
a
is
one
in
which
the
agreement
of
the
predicate
and
subject
is
examples
of
both
of
these
classes
have
been
given
in
this
chapter
another
classification
of
propositions
divides
them
in
three
classes
as
follows
categorical
hypothetical
disjunctive
a
is
one
in
which
the
affirmation
or
denial
is
made
without
reservation
or
qualification
as
for
instance
man
is
an
animal
the
rose
is
a
flower
etc
the
fact
asserted
may
not
be
but
the
statement
is
made
positively
as
a
statement
of
reality
a
is
one
in
which
the
affirmation
or
denial
is
made
to
depend
upon
certain
conditions
circumstances
or
suppositions
as
for
instance
if
the
water
is
it
will
scald
or
if
the
powder
be
damp
it
will
not
explode
etc
jevons
says
hypothetical
propositions
may
generally
be
recognized
by
containing
the
little
word
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
really
differ
much
from
the
ordinary
propositions
we
may
easily
say
that
water
will
scald
and
gunpowder
will
not
explode
thus
avoiding
the
use
of
the
word
a
is
one
implying
or
asserting
an
alternative
and
usually
containing
the
conjunction
or
sometimes
together
with
either
as
for
instance
lightning
is
sheet
or
forked
arches
are
either
round
or
pointed
angles
are
either
obtuse
right
angled
or
acute
another
classification
of
propositions
divides
them
in
two
classes
as
follows
universal
particular
a
is
one
in
which
the
of
the
subject
is
involved
in
the
assertion
or
denial
of
the
predicate
for
instance
all
men
are
liars
by
which
is
affirmed
that
of
the
entire
race
of
men
are
in
the
category
of
liars
not
men
but
the
men
that
are
in
existence
in
the
same
way
the
proposition
no
men
are
immortal
is
universal
for
it
is
a
a
is
one
in
which
the
affirmation
or
denial
of
the
predicate
involves
only
a
or
of
the
whole
of
the
subject
as
for
instance
men
are
atheists
or
women
are
not
vain
in
which
cases
the
affirmation
or
denial
does
not
involve
or
the
of
the
subject
other
examples
are
a
men
etc
people
etc
books
etc
people
etc
hyslop
says
the
signs
of
the
universal
proposition
when
formally
expressed
are
or
words
with
equivalent
import
the
signs
of
particular
propositions
are
also
certain
adjectives
of
quantity
such
as
or
such
others
as
denote
least
a
of
a
class
the
subject
of
the
distribution
of
terms
in
propositions
is
considered
very
important
by
logicians
and
as
hyslop
says
has
much
importance
in
determining
the
legitimacy
or
at
least
the
intelligibility
of
our
reasoning
and
the
assurance
that
it
will
be
accepted
by
others
some
authorities
favor
the
term
qualification
of
the
terms
of
propositions
but
the
established
usage
favors
the
term
distribution
the
definition
of
the
logical
term
distribution
is
the
distinguishing
of
a
universal
whole
into
its
several
kinds
of
species
the
employment
of
a
term
to
its
fullest
extent
the
application
of
a
term
to
its
fullest
extent
so
as
to
include
all
significations
or
applications
a
term
of
a
proposition
is
when
it
is
employed
in
its
fullest
sense
that
is
to
say
it
is
employed
so
as
to
apply
to
each
and
every
object
person
or
thing
included
under
thus
in
the
proposition
all
horses
are
animals
the
term
is
distributed
and
in
the
proposition
some
horses
are
thoroughbreds
the
term
is
not
distributed
both
of
these
examples
relate
to
the
distribution
of
the
of
the
proposition
but
the
predicate
of
a
proposition
also
may
or
may
not
be
distributed
for
instance
in
the
proposition
all
horses
are
animals
the
predicate
is
not
distributed
that
is
used
in
its
fullest
for
all
are
not
there
are
animals
which
are
not
horses
and
therefore
the
predicate
not
being
used
in
its
fullest
sense
is
said
to
be
the
proposition
really
means
all
horses
are
animals
there
is
however
another
point
to
be
remembered
in
the
consideration
of
distribution
of
terms
of
propositions
which
brooks
expresses
as
follows
distribution
generally
shows
itself
in
the
form
of
the
expression
but
sometimes
it
may
be
determined
by
the
thought
thus
if
we
say
are
mortal
we
mean
and
the
term
men
is
distributed
but
if
we
say
are
necessary
to
a
library
we
mean
not
books
but
books
the
of
is
whether
the
term
applies
to
and
thus
when
we
say
are
mortal
it
is
true
of
each
and
every
man
that
he
is
mortal
the
rules
of
distribution
of
the
terms
of
proposition
are
as
follows
all
distribute
the
all
do
not
distribute
the
all
distribute
the
all
do
not
distribute
the
the
above
rules
are
based
upon
logical
reasoning
the
reason
for
the
first
two
rules
is
quite
obvious
for
when
the
subject
is
it
follows
that
the
is
involved
when
the
subject
is
it
follows
that
a
of
the
subject
is
involved
in
the
case
of
the
third
rule
it
will
be
seen
that
in
every
proposition
the
of
the
must
be
denied
the
subject
as
for
instance
when
we
say
some
are
the
whole
class
of
is
cut
off
from
the
subject
and
is
thus
in
the
case
of
the
fourth
rule
we
may
readily
see
that
in
the
affirmative
proposition
the
whole
of
the
predicate
not
the
subject
as
for
instance
when
we
say
that
horses
are
animals
we
do
not
mean
that
horses
are
the
but
that
they
are
merely
a
or
of
the
class
animal
therefore
the
predicate
is
not
distributed
in
addition
to
the
forms
of
propositions
given
there
is
another
class
of
propositions
known
as
or
substitutive
in
which
the
subject
and
the
predicate
are
exactly
alike
in
extent
and
rank
for
instance
in
the
proposition
a
is
a
of
three
the
two
terms
are
interchangeable
that
is
may
be
substituted
for
each
other
hence
the
term
substitutive
the
term
definitive
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
respective
terms
of
this
kind
of
a
proposition
necessarily
each
other
all
logical
definitions
are
expressed
in
this
last
mentioned
form
of
proposition
for
in
such
cases
the
subject
and
the
predicate
are
precisely
equal
to
each
other
chapter
x
immediate
reasoning
in
the
process
of
judgment
we
must
compare
two
concepts
and
ascertain
their
agreement
of
disagreement
in
the
process
of
reasoning
we
follow
a
similar
method
and
compare
two
judgments
the
result
of
such
comparison
being
the
deduction
of
a
third
judgment
the
simplest
form
of
reasoning
is
that
known
as
immediate
reasoning
by
which
is
meant
the
deduction
of
one
proposition
from
another
which
it
some
have
defined
it
as
without
a
middle
in
this
form
of
reasoning
one
proposition
is
required
for
the
and
from
that
premise
the
conclusion
is
deduced
directly
and
without
the
necessity
of
comparison
with
any
other
term
of
proposition
the
two
principal
methods
employed
in
this
form
of
reasoning
are
opposition
conversion
exists
between
propositions
having
the
same
subject
and
predicate
but
differing
in
quality
or
quantity
or
both
the
laws
of
opposition
are
as
follows
i
if
the
universal
is
true
the
particular
is
true
if
the
particular
is
false
the
universal
is
false
if
the
universal
is
false
nothing
follows
if
the
particular
is
true
nothing
follows
ii
if
one
of
two
contraries
is
true
the
other
is
false
if
one
of
two
contraries
is
false
nothing
can
be
inferred
contraries
are
never
both
true
but
both
may
be
false
iii
if
one
of
two
is
false
the
other
is
true
if
one
of
two
is
true
nothing
can
be
inferred
concerning
the
other
can
never
be
both
false
but
both
may
be
true
iv
if
one
of
two
contradictories
is
true
the
other
is
false
if
one
of
two
contradictories
is
false
the
other
is
true
contradictories
can
never
be
both
true
or
both
false
but
always
one
is
true
and
the
other
is
false
in
order
to
comprehend
the
above
laws
the
student
should
familiarize
himself
with
the
following
arrangement
adopted
by
logicians
as
a
convenience
universal

i
some
men
are

particular
negative
o
some
men
are
not

the
following
examples
of
abstract
propositions
are
often
used
by
logicians
as
tending
toward
a
clearer
conception
than
examples
such
as
given

a
all
a
is
b
i
some
a
is
b
e
no
a
is
b
o
some
a
is
not

these
four
forms
of
propositions
bear
certain
logical
relations
to
each
other
as
follows
a
and
e
are
styled
i
and
o
are
a
and
i
and
also
e
and
o
are
called
a
and
o
and
also
i
and
e
are
styled
a
close
study
of
these
relations
and
the
symbols
expressing
them
is
necessary
for
a
clear
comprehension
of
the
laws
of
opposition
stated
a
little
further
back
as
well
as
the
principles
of
conversion
which
we
shall
mention
a
little
further
on
the
following
chart
called
the
square
of

also
employed
by
logicians
to
illustrate
the
relations
between
the
four
classes
of
propositions
a
contraries
e
i
o
is
the
process
of
immediate
reasoning
by
which
we
infer
from
a
given
proposition
another
proposition
having
the
predicate
of
the
original
for
its
subject
and
the
subject
of
the
original
for
its
predicate
or
stated
in
a
few
words
is
the
transposition
of
the
subject
and
predicate
of
a
as
brooks
states
it
propositions
or
judgments
are
when
the
subject
and
predicate
change
places
in
such
a
manner
that
the
resulting
judgment
is
an
inference
from
the
given
judgment
the
new
proposition
resulting
from
the
operation
or
conversion
is
called
the
converse
the
original
proposition
is
called
the
convertend
law
of
is
that
no
term
must
be
distributed
in
the
converse
that
is
not
distributed
in
the
convertend
this
arises
from
the
obvious
fact
that
nothing
should
be
affirmed
in
the
derived
proposition
than
there
is
in
the
original
proposition
there
are
three
kinds
of
conversion
simple
conversion
conversion
by
limitation
conversion
by
contraposition
in
there
is
no
change
in
either
quality
or
quantity
in
by
the
quality
is
changed
from
universal
to
particular
in
conversion
by
negation
the
quality
is
changed
but
not
the
quantity
referring
to
the
classification
tables
and
symbols
given
in
the
preceding
pages
of
this
chapter
we
may
now
proceed
to
consider
the
application
of
these
methods
of
conversion
to
each
of
the
four
kinds
of
propositions
as
follows
universal
symbol
a
proposition
is
converted
by
limitation
or
by
a
change
of
quality
from
universal
to
particular
the
predicate
not
being
distributed
in
the
convertend
we
must
not
distribute
it
in
the
converse
by
saying
thus
in
this
case
we
must
convert
the
proposition
all
men
are
mortal
a
into
some
mortals
are
men
i
universal
symbol
e
is
converted
by
simple
conversion
in
which
there
is
no
change
in
either
quality
or
quantity
for
since
both
terms
of
e
are
distributed
they
may
both
be
distributed
in
the
converse
without
violating
the
law
of
conversion
thus
no
man
is
mortal
is
converted
into
no
mortals
are
men
e
is
converted
into
particular
symbol
i
is
also
converted
by
simple
conversion
in
which
there
is
no
change
in
either
quality
or
quantity
for
since
neither
term
is
distributed
in
i
neither
term
may
be
distributed
in
the
converse
and
the
latter
must
remain
i
for
instance
the
proposition
some
men
are
mortal
is
converted
into
the
proposition
some
mortals
are
men
particular
symbol
o
is
converted
by
conversion
by
negation
in
which
the
quality
is
changed
but
not
the
quantity
thus
in
converting
the
proposition
some
men
are
not
mortal
we
must
say
some
mortals
are
not
men
for
in
so
doing
we
would
distribute
in
the
predicate
where
it
is
not
distributed
in
the
convertend
avoiding
this
transfer
the
negative
particle
from
the
copula
to
the
so
that
the
convertend
becomes
i
which
is
converted
by
simple
conversion
thus
we
transfer
some
men
are
not
mortal
into
some
men
are
from
which
we
easily
convert
by
simple
conversion
the
proposition
some
are
men
it
will
be
well
for
students
at
this
point
to
consider
the
three
following
fundamental
laws
of
thought
as
laid
down
by
the
authorities
which
are
as
follows
law
of
which
states
that
the
same
quality
or
thing
is
always
the
same
quality
or
thing
no
matter
how
different
the
conditions
in
which
it
occurs
law
of
which
states
that
no
thing
can
at
the
same
time
and
place
both
be
and
not
be
law
of
excluded
which
states
that
everything
must
either
be
or
not
be
there
is
no
other
alternative
or
middle
course
of
these
laws
jevons
a
noted
authority
says
students
are
seldom
able
to
see
at
first
their
full
meaning
and
importance
all
arguments
may
be
explained
when
these
laws
are
granted
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
whole
of
logic
will
be
plain
to
those
who
will
constantly
use
these
laws
as
the
key
chapter
xi
inductive
reasoning
inductive
reasoning
as
we
have
said
is
the
process
of
discovering
general
truth
from
particular
truths
or
inferring
general
laws
from
particular
facts
thus
from
the
experience
of
the
individual
and
the
race
regarding
the
particular
truth
that
each
and
every
man
under
observation
has
been
observed
to
die
sooner
or
later
it
is
inferred
that
men
die
and
hence
the
induction
of
the
general
truth
that
all
men
must
die
or
as
from
experience
we
know
that
the
various
kinds
of
metals
expand
when
subjected
to
heat
we
infer
that
metals
are
subject
to
this
law
and
that
consequently
we
may
arrive
by
inductive
reasoning
at
the
conclusion
that
all
metals
expand
when
subjected
to
heat
it
will
be
noticed
that
the
conclusion
arrived
at
in
this
way
by
inductive
reasoning
forms
the
fundamental
premise
in
the
process
of
deductive
reasoning
as
we
have
seen
elsewhere
the
two
processes
inductive
and
deductive
reasoning
respectively
are
interdependent
resting
upon
one
another
jevons
says
of
inductive
reasoning
in
deductive
reasoning
we
inquire
how
we
may
gather
the
truth
contained
in
some
propositions
called
premises
and
put
into
another
proposition
called
the
conclusion
we
have
not
yet
undertaken
to
find
out
how
we
can
learn
what
propositions
really
are
true
but
only
propositions
are
true
when
other
ones
are
all
the
acts
of
reasoning
yet
considered
would
be
called
because
we
deduce
or
lead
down
the
truth
from
premises
to
it
is
an
exceedingly
important
thing
to
understand
deductive
inference
correctly
but
it
might
seem
to
be
still
more
important
to
understand
by
which
we
gather
the
truth
of
general
propositions
from
facts
observed
as
happening
in
the
world
around
us
halleck
says
man
has
to
find
out
through
his
own
experience
or
that
of
others
the
major
premises
from
which
he
argues
or
draws
his
conclusions
by
induction
we
examine
what
seems
to
us
a
sufficient
number
of
individual
cases
we
then
conclude
that
the
rest
of
these
cases
which
we
have
not
examined
will
obey
the
same
general
law
only
after
general
laws
have
been
laid
down
after
objects
have
been
classified
after
major
premises
have
been
formed
can
deduction
be
employed
strange
as
may
now
appear
it
is
a
fact
that
until
a
comparatively
recent
period
in
the
history
of
man
it
was
held
by
philosophers
that
the
only
way
to
arrive
at
all
knowledge
was
by
means
of
deductive
reasoning
by
the
use
of
the
syllogism
the
influence
of
aristotle
was
great
and
men
preferred
to
pursue
artificial
and
complicated
methods
of
deductive
reasoning
rather
than
to
reach
the
truth
by
obtaining
the
facts
from
nature
herself
at
first
hand
and
then
inferring
general
principle
from
the
facts
so
gathered
the
rise
of
modern
scientific
methods
of
reasoning
along
the
lines
of
inductive
inference
dates
from
about
roger
bacon
was
one
of
the
first
to
teach
that
we
must
arrive
at
scientific
truth
by
a
process
of
observation
and
experimentation
on
the
natural
objects
to
be
found
on
all
sides
he
made
many
discoveries
by
following
this
process
he
was
ably
seconded
by
galileo
who
lived
some
three
hundred
years
later
and
who
also
taught
that
many
great
general
truths
might
be
gained
by
careful
observation
and
intelligent
inference
lord
francis
bacon
who
lived
about
the
same
time
as
galileo
presented
in
his
many
excellent
observations
and
facts
regarding
the
process
of
inductive
reasoning
and
scientific
thought
as
jevons
says
inductive
logic
inquires
by
what
manner
of
reasoning
we
can
gather
the
laws
of
nature
from
the
facts
and
events
observed
such
reasoning
is
called
induction
or
inductive
inquiry
and
as
it
has
actually
been
practiced
by
all
the
great
discoverers
in
science
it
consists
in
four
steps
the
steps
in
inductive
as
stated
by
jevons
are
as
follows
preliminary
observation
the
making
of
hypotheses
deductive
reasoning
verification
it
will
be
seen
that
the
process
of
inductive
reasoning
is
essentially
synthetic
because
it
operates
in
the
direction
of
combining
and
uniting
particular
facts
or
truths
into
general
truths
or
laws
which
comprehend
embrace
and
include
them
all
as
brooks
says
the
particular
facts
are
united
by
the
mind
into
the
general
law
the
general
law
embraces
the
particular
facts
and
binds
them
together
into
a
unity
of
principle
and
thought
induction
is
thus
a
process
of
thought
from
the
parts
to
the
whole
a
synthetic
process
it
will
also
be
seen
that
the
process
of
inductive
reasoning
is
essentially
ascending
because
it
ascends
from
particular
facts
to
general
laws
particular
truths
to
universal
truths
from
the
lower
to
the
higher
the
narrower
to
the
broader
the
smaller
to
the
greater
brooks
says
of
inductive
reasoning
the
relation
of
induction
to
deduction
will
be
clearly
seen
induction
and
deduction
are
the
converse
the
opposites
of
each
other
deduction
derives
a
particular
truth
from
a
general
truth
induction
derives
a
general
truth
from
particular
truths
this
antithesis
appears
in
every
particular
deduction
goes
from
generals
to
particulars
induction
goes
from
particulars
to
generals
deduction
is
an
analytic
process
induction
is
a
synthetic
process
deduction
is
a
descending
process
it
goes
from
the
higher
truth
to
the
lower
truth
induction
is
an
ascending
process
it
goes
from
the
lower
truth
to
the
higher
they
differ
also
in
that
deduction
may
be
applied
to
necessary
truths
while
induction
is
mainly
restricted
to
contingent
truths
hyslop
says
there
have
been
several
ways
of
defining
this
process
it
has
been
usual
to
contrast
it
with
deduction
now
deduction
is
often
said
to
be
reasoning
from
general
to
particular
truths
from
the
containing
to
the
contained
truth
or
from
cause
to
effect
induction
therefore
by
contrast
is
defined
as
reasoning
from
the
particular
to
the
general
from
the
contained
to
the
containing
or
from
effect
to
cause
sometimes
induction
is
said
to
be
reasoning
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
this
would
make
deduction
by
contrast
reasoning
from
the
unknown
to
the
known
which
is
absurd
the
former
ways
of
representing
it
are
much
the
better
but
there
is
still
a
better
way
of
comparing
them
deduction
reasoning
in
which
the
conclusion
is
contained
in
the
this
is
a
ground
for
its
certitude
and
we
commit
a
fallacy
whenever
we
go
beyond
the
premises
as
shown
by
the
laws
of
the
distribution
of
terms
in
contrast
with
this
then
we
may
call
inductive
reasoning
process
by
which
we
go
beyond
the
premises
in
the
the
process
here
is
to
start
from
given
facts
and
to
infer
some
other
probable
facts
more
general
or
connected
with
them
in
this
we
see
the
process
of
going
beyond
the
premises
there
are
of
course
certain
conditions
which
regulate
the
legitimacy
of
the
procedure
just
as
there
are
conditions
determining
deduction
they
are
the
conclusion
shall
represent
the
same
general
kind
as
the
with
a
possibility
of
accidental
differences
but
it
goes
beyond
the
premises
in
so
far
as
facts
are
concerned
the
following
example
may
give
you
a
clearer
idea
of
the
processes
of
inductive
reasoning
preliminary

we
notice
that
all
the

which
have

and

axiom
of

reasoning
that
what
is
true
of

is
true
of

we
feel
justified
in

and
that

else

chapter
xii
reasoning
by
induction
the
term
induction
in
its
logical
usage
is
defined
as
follows
a
the
process
of
investigating
and
collecting
facts
and
b
the
deducing
of
an
inference
from
these
facts
also
c
sometimes
loosely
used
in
the
sense
of
an
inference
from
observed
facts
mill
says
then
is
that
operation
of
the
mind
by
which
we
infer
that
what
we
know
to
be
true
in
a
particular
case
or
cases
will
be
true
in
all
cases
which
resemble
the
former
in
certain
assignable
respects
in
other
words
is
the
process
by
which
we
conclude
that
what
is
true
of
certain
individuals
of
a
class
is
true
of
the
whole
class
or
that
what
is
true
at
certain
times
will
be
true
in
similar
circumstances
at
all
times
the
of
is
the
axiom
that
is
true
of
the
many
is
true
of
the
esser
a
well
known
authority
states
this
axiom
in
rather
more
complicated
form
as
follows
that
which
belongs
or
does
not
belong
to
many
things
of
the
same
kind
belongs
or
does
not
belong
to
all
things
of
the
same
kind
this
basic
axiom
of
induction
rests
upon
the
conviction
that
laws
and
manifestations
are
regular
orderly
and
if
we
assume
that
nature
does
not
manifest
these
qualities
then
the
axiom
must
fall
and
all
inductive
reason
must
be
fallacious
as
brooks
well
says
induction
has
been
compared
to
a
ladder
upon
which
we
ascend
from
facts
to
laws
this
ladder
can
not
stand
unless
it
has
something
to
rest
upon
and
this
something
is
our
faith
in
the
constancy
of
nature
laws
some
authorities
have
held
that
this
perception
of
the
uniformity
of
laws
is
in
the
nature
of
an
truth
or
an
inherent
law
of
our
intelligence
others
hold
that
it
is
in
itself
an
truth
arrived
at
by
experience
and
observation
at
a
very
early
age
we
are
held
to
have
noticed
the
uniformity
in
natural
phenomena
and
almost
instinctively
infer
that
this
uniformity
is
continuous
and
universal
the
authorities
assume
the
existence
of
two
kinds
of
induction
namely
perfect
induction
and
imperfect
induction
other
but
similar
terms
are
employed
by
different
authorities
to
designate
these
two
classes
necessitates
a
knowledge
of
the
particulars
forming
a
class
that
is
the
individual
objects
persons
things
or
facts
comprising
a
class
must
be
known
and
enumerated
in
this
form
of
induction
for
instance
if
we
all
of
children
and
that
their
names
were
john
peter
mark
luke
charles
william
mary
and
susan
respectively
and
that
each
and
every
one
of
them
were
freckled
and
had
red
hair
then
in
that
case
instead
of
simply
and
stating
that
john
peter
mark
luke
charles
william
mary
and
susan
who
are
of
brown
children
are
freckled
and
have
red
hair
we
would
save
words
and
state
the
inductive
conclusion
all
brown
children
are
freckled
and
have
red
hair
it
will
be
noticed
that
in
this
case
include
in
the
process
only
what
is
stated
in
the
premise
and
we
do
not
extend
our
inductive
process
beyond
the
actual
data
upon
which
it
is
based
this
form
of
induction
is
sometimes
called
logical
induction
because
the
inference
is
a
logical
necessity
without
the
possibility
of
error
or
exception
by
some
authorities
it
is
held
not
to
be
induction
at
all
in
the
strict
sense
but
little
more
than
a
simplified
form
of
enumeration
in
actual
practice
it
is
seldom
available
for
it
is
almost
impossible
for
us
to
know
all
the
particulars
in
inferring
a
general
law
or
truth
in
view
of
this
difficulty
we
fall
back
upon
the
more
practical
form
of
induction
known
as
or
as
it
is
sometimes
called
practical
induction
by
which
is
meant
the
inductive
process
of
reasoning
in
which
we
assume
that
the
particulars
or
facts
actually
known
to
us
correctly
represent
those
which
are
not
actually
known
and
hence
the
whole
class
to
which
they
belong
in
this
process
it
will
be
seen
that
conclusion
beyond
the
data
upon
which
it
is
based
in
this
form
of
induction
we
must
actually
employ
the
principle
of
the
axiom
what
is
true
of
the
many
is
true
of
the
whole
that
is
must
it
to
be
a
fact
not
because
we
it
by
actual
experience
but
because
we
infer
it
from
the
axiom
which
also
agrees
with
past
experience
the
conclusion
arrived
at
may
not
always
be
true
in
its
fullest
sense
as
in
the
case
of
the
conclusion
of
perfect
induction
but
is
the
result
of
an
inference
based
upon
a
principle
which
gives
us
a
reasonable
right
to
assume
its
truth
in
absence
of
better
knowledge
in
considering
the
actual
steps
in
the
process
of
inductive
reasoning
we
can
do
no
better
than
to
follow
the
classification
of
jevons
mentioned
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
same
being
simple
and
readily
comprehended
and
therefore
preferable
in
this
case
to
the
more
technical
classification
favored
by
some
other
authorities
let
us
now
consider
these
four
steps
preliminary
observation
it
follows
that
without
the
experience
of
oneself
or
of
others
in
the
direction
of
observing
and
remembering
particular
facts
objects
persons
and
things
we
can
not
hope
to
acquire
the
preliminary
facts
for
the
generalization
and
inductive
inference
necessary
in
inductive
reasoning
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
form
a
variety
of
clear
concepts
or
ideas
of
facts
objects
persons
and
things
before
we
may
hope
to
generalize
from
these
particulars
in
the
chapters
of
this
book
devoted
to
the
consideration
of
concepts
we
may
see
the
fundamental
importance
of
the
formation
and
acquirement
of
correct
concepts
concepts
are
the
fundamental
material
for
correct
reasoning
in
order
to
produce
a
perfect
finished
product
we
must
have
perfect
materials
and
a
sufficient
quantity
of
them
the
greater
the
knowledge
one
possesses
of
the
facts
and
objects
of
the
outside
world
the
better
able
is
he
to
reason
therefrom
concepts
are
the
raw
material
which
must
feed
the
machinery
of
reasoning
and
from
which
the
final
product
of
perfected
thought
is
produced
as
halleck
says
there
must
first
be
a
presentation
of
materials
suppose
that
we
wish
to
form
the
concept
we
must
first
perceive
the
different
kinds
of
fruit
cherry
pear
quince
plum
currant
apple
fig
orange
etc
before
we
can
take
the
next
step
we
must
be
able
to
form
distinct
and
accurate
images
of
the
various
kinds
of
fruit
if
the
concept
is
to
be
absolutely
accurate
not
one
kind
of
fruit
must
be
overlooked
practically
this
is
impossible
but
many
kinds
should
be
examined
where
perception
is
inaccurate
and
stinted
the
products
of
thought
can
not
be
trustworthy
no
building
is
firm
if
reared
on
insecure
foundations
in
the
process
of
preliminary
observation
we
find
that
there
are
two
ways
of
obtaining
a
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
things
around
us
these
two
ways
are
as
follows
i
by
or
the
perception
of
the
happenings
which
are
manifested
without
our
interference
in
this
way
we
perceive
the
motion
of
the
tides
the
movement
of
the
planets
the
phenomena
of
the
weather
the
passing
of
animals
etc
ii
by
the
of
or
the
perception
of
happenings
in
which
we
interfere
with
things
and
then
observe
the
result
an
is
a
trial
proof
or
test
of
anything
an
act
operation
or
process
designed
to
discover
some
unknown
truth
principle
or
effect
or
to
test
some
received
or
reputed
truth
or
principle
hobbes
says
to
have
had
many
is
what
we
call
jevons
says
experimentation
is
observation
with
something
more
namely
regulation
of
the
things
whose
behavior
is
to
be
observed
the
advantages
of
experiment
over
mere
observation
are
of
two
kinds
in
the
first
place
we
shall
generally
know
much
more
certainly
and
accurately
with
what
we
are
dealing
when
we
make
experiments
than
when
we
simply
observe
natural
events
it
is
a
further
advantage
of
artificial
experiments
that
they
enable
us
to
discover
entirely
new
substances
and
to
learn
their
properties
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
making
of
an
experiment
is
inductive
reasoning
and
gives
us
without
further
trouble
the
laws
of
nature
only
give
us
the
facts
upon
which
we
may
afterward
reason
experiments
then
merely
give
facts
and
it
is
only
by
careful
reasoning
that
we
can
learn
when
the
same
facts
will
be
observed
again
general
rule
is
that
the
same
causes
will
produce
the
same
whatever
happens
in
one
case
will
happen
in
all
like
cases
provided
that
they
are
really
like
and
not
merely
apparently
so
when
we
have
by
repeated
experiments
tried
the
effect
which
all
the
surrounding
things
might
have
on
the
result
we
can
then
reason
with
much
confidence
as
to
similar
results
in
similar
circumstances
in
order
that
we
may
from
our
observations
and
experiments
learn
the
law
of
nature
and
become
able
to
foresee
the
future
we
must
perform
the
process
of
generalization
to
generalize
is
to
draw
a
general
law
from
particular
cases
and
to
infer
that
what
we
see
to
be
true
of
a
few
things
is
true
of
the
whole
genus
or
class
to
which
these
things
belong
it
requires
much
judgment
and
skill
to
generalize
correctly
because
everything
depends
upon
the
number
and
character
of
the
instances
about
which
we
reason
having
seen
that
the
first
step
in
inductive
reasoning
is
preliminary
observation
let
us
now
consider
the
next
steps
in
which
we
may
see
what
we
do
with
the
facts
and
ideas
which
we
have
acquired
by
this
observation
and
experiment
chapter
xiii
theory
and
hypotheses
following
jevons
classification
we
find
that
the
second
step
in
inductive
reasoning
is
that
called
the
making
of
hypotheses
a
is
a
supposition
proposition
or
principle
or
taken
for
in
order
to
draw
a
conclusion
or
inference
in
proof
of
the
point
or
question
a
proposition
assumed
or
taken
for
granted
though
not
proved
for
the
purpose
of
deducing
proof
of
a
point
in
question
it
will
be
seen
that
a
hypothesis
is
merely
held
to
be
or
probably
and
certainly
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
whose
truth
must
be
tested
by
observed
facts
the
assumption
may
apply
either
to
the
of
things
or
to
the
which
govern
things
akin
to
a
hypothesis
and
by
many
people
confused
in
meaning
with
the
latter
is
what
is
called
a
theory
a
is
a
verified
hypothesis
a
hypothesis
which
has
been
established
as
apparently
the
true
one
an
authority
says
is
a
stronger
word
than
a
is
founded
on
principles
which
have
been
established
on
independent
evidence
a
merely
assumes
the
operation
of
a
cause
which
would
account
for
the
phenomena
but
has
not
evidence
that
such
cause
was
actually
at
work
metaphysically
a
theory
is
nothing
but
a
hypothesis
supported
by
a
large
amount
of
probable
evidence
brooks
says
when
a
hypothesis
is
shown
to
explain
all
the
facts
that
are
known
these
facts
being
varied
and
extensive
it
is
said
to
be
verified
and
becomes
a
theory
thus
we
have
the
theory
of
universal
gravitation
the
copernican
theory
of
the
solar
system
the
undulatory
theory
of
light
all
of
which
were
originally
mere
hypotheses
this
is
the
manner
in
which
the
term
is
usually
employed
in
the
inductive
philosophy
though
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
is
not
always
used
in
this
strict
sense
discarded
hypotheses
are
often
referred
to
as
theories
and
that
which
is
actually
a
theory
is
sometimes
called
a
hypothesis
the
steps
by
which
we
build
up
a
hypothesis
are
numerous
and
varied
in
the
first
place
we
may
erect
a
hypothesis
by
the
methods
of
what
we
have
described
as
perfect
induction
or
logical
induction
in
this
case
we
proceed
by
simple
generalization
or
simple
enumeration
the
example
of
the
freckled
children
of
brown
mentioned
in
a
previous
chapter
explains
this
method
it
requires
the
examination
and
knowledge
of
every
object
or
fact
of
which
the
statement
or
hypothesis
is
made
hamilton
states
that
it
is
the
only
induction
which
is
absolutely
necessitated
by
the
laws
of
thought
it
does
not
extend
further
than
the
plane
of
experience
it
is
akin
to
mathematical
reasoning
far
more
important
is
the
process
by
which
hypotheses
are
erected
by
means
of
inferences
from
imperfect
induction
by
which
we
reason
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
transcending
experience
and
making
true
inductive
inferences
from
the
axiom
of
inductive
reasoning
this
process
involves
the
subject
of
causes
jevons
says
the
cause
of
an
event
is
that
antecedent
or
set
of
antecedents
from
which
the
event
always
follows
people
often
make
much
difficulty
about
understanding
what
the
cause
of
an
event
means
but
it
really
means
nothing
beyond
things
that
must
exist
before
in
order
that
the
event
shall
happen
causes
are
often
obscure
and
difficult
to
determine
the
following
five
difficulties
are
likely
to
arise
i
the
cause
may
be
out
of
our
experience
and
is
therefore
not
to
be
understood
ii
causes
often
act
conjointly
so
that
it
is
difficult
to
discover
the
one
predominant
cause
by
reason
of
its
associated
causes
iii
often
the
presence
of
a
counteracting
or
modifying
cause
may
confuse
us
iv
often
a
certain
effect
may
be
caused
by
either
of
several
possible
causes
that
which
appears
as
a
of
a
certain
effect
may
be
but
a
of
an
original
cause
mill
formulated
several
tests
for
ascertaining
the
causal
agency
in
particular
cases
in
view
of
the
difficulties
these
tests
are
as
follows
the
method
of
agreement
the
method
of
difference
the
method
of
residues
and
the
method
of
concomitant
variations
the
following
definitions
of
these
various
tests
are
given
by
atwater
as
follows
of
if
whenever
a
given
object
or
agency
is
present
without
counteracting
forces
a
given
effect
is
produced
there
is
a
strong
evidence
that
the
object
or
agency
is
the
cause
of
the
effect
of
if
when
the
supposed
cause
is
present
the
effect
is
present
and
when
the
supposed
cause
is
absent
the
effect
is
wanting
there
being
in
neither
case
any
other
agents
present
to
effect
the
result
we
may
reasonably
infer
that
the
supposed
cause
is
the
real
one
of
when
in
any
phenomena
we
find
a
result
remaining
after
the
effects
of
all
known
causes
are
estimated
we
may
attribute
it
to
a
residual
agent
not
yet
reckoned
of
concomitant
when
a
variation
in
a
given
antecedent
is
accompanied
by
a
variation
of
a
given
consequent
they
are
in
some
manner
related
as
cause
and
effect
atwater
adds
whenever
either
of
these
criteria
is
found
free
from
conflicting
evidence
and
especially
when
several
of
them
concur
the
evidence
is
clear
that
the
cases
observed
are
fair
representatives
of
the
whole
class
and
warrant
a
valid
inductive
conclusion
jevons
gives
us
the
following
valuable
rules
i
whenever
we
can
alter
the
quantity
of
the
things
experimented
on
we
can
apply
rule
for
discovering
which
are
causes
and
which
are
as
follows
we
must
vary
the
quantity
of
one
thing
making
it
at
one
time
greater
and
at
another
time
less
and
if
we
observe
any
other
thing
which
varies
just
at
the
same
times
it
will
in
all
probability
be
an
ii
when
things
vary
regularly
and
frequently
there
is
simple
rule
by
following
which
we
can
judge
whether
changes
are
connected
together
as
causes
and
as
follows
those
things
which
change
in
exactly
equal
times
are
in
all
likelihood
connected
together
iii
it
is
very
difficult
to
explain
how
it
is
that
we
can
ever
reason
from
one
thing
to
a
class
of
things
by
generalization
we
can
not
be
sure
that
the
things
resemble
each
other
in
the
important
upon
what
grounds
do
we
argue
we
have
to
get
a
general
law
from
particular
facts
this
can
only
be
done
by
going
through
all
the
steps
of
inductive
reasoning
having
made
certain
observations
we
must
frame
hypotheses
as
to
the
circumstances
or
laws
from
which
they
proceed
then
we
must
reason
deductively
and
after
verifying
the
deductions
in
as
many
cases
as
possible
we
shall
know
how
far
we
can
trust
similar
deductions
concerning
future
events
it
is
difficult
to
judge
when
we
may
and
when
we
may
not
safely
infer
from
some
things
to
others
in
this
simple
way
without
making
a
complete
theory
of
the
matter
only
that
can
be
given
to
assist
us
is
that
things
resemble
each
other
in
a
few
properties
only
we
must
observe
many
instances
before
inferring
that
these
properties
will
always
be
joined
together
in
other
chapter
xiv
making
and
testing
hypotheses
the
older
philosophers
and
logicians
were
often
at
a
loss
how
to
reasonably
account
for
the
origin
of
hypotheses
it
will
be
seen
after
giving
the
matter
a
little
thought
that
the
actual
formation
of
the
hypothesis
is
more
than
a
mere
grouping
together
or
synthesis
of
facts
or
ideas
there
is
another
mental
process
which
actually
evolves
the
hypothesis
or
theory
which
gives
possible
what
is
this
mental
process
let
us
consider
the
matter
brooks
well
says
the
hypotheses
of
science
originate
in
what
is
called
anticipation
they
are
not
the
result
of
a
mere
synthesis
of
facts
for
no
combination
of
facts
can
give
the
law
or
cause
we
do
not
see
the
law
we
see
the
facts
and
mind
thinks
the
by
the
power
of
anticipation
the
mind
often
leaps
from
a
few
facts
to
the
cause
which
produces
them
or
the
law
which
governs
them
many
hypotheses
were
but
happy
intuition
of
the
they
were
the
result
of
what
la
place
calls
great
guess
or
what
plato
so
beautifully
designates
as
sacred
suspicion
of
truth
the
forming
of
hypotheses
requires
a
suggestive
mind
a
lively
fancy
a
philosophic
imagination
that
catches
a
glimpse
of
the
idea
through
the
form
or
sees
the
law
standing
behind
the
fact
the
student
of
the
new
psychology
sees
in
the
mental
operation
of
the
forming
of
the
hypothesis
the
mind
thinking
the
law
but
an
instance
of
the
operation
of
the
activities
of
the
subconscious
mind
or
even
the
superconscious
mind
see
the
volume
on
the
subconscious
mind
in
this
series
not
only
does
this
hypothesis
give
the
explanation
which
the
old
psychology
has
failed
to
do
but
it
agrees
with
the
ideas
of
others
on
the
subject
as
stated
in
the
above
quotation
from
brooks
and
moreover
agrees
with
many
recorded
instances
of
the
formation
of
great
hypotheses
sir
wm
hamilton
discovered
the
very
important
mathematical
law
of
quaternions
while
walking
one
day
in
the
dublin
observatory
he
had
pondered
long
on
the
subject
but
without
result
but
finally
on
that
eventful
day
he
suddenly
felt
the
galvanic
circle
of
thought
close
and
the
result
was
the
realization
of
the
fundamental
mathematical
relations
of
the
problem
berthelot
the
founder
of
synthetic
chemistry
has
testified
that
the
celebrated
experiments
which
led
to
his
remarkable
discoveries
were
seldom
the
result
of
carefully
followed
lines
of
conscious
thought
or
pure
reasoning
processes
but
instead
came
to
him
of
their
own
accord
so
to
speak
as
from
a
clear
sky
in
these
and
many
other
similar
instances
the
mental
operation
was
undoubtedly
purely
subjective
and
subconscious
hudson
has
claimed
that
the
subjective
mind
can
not
reason
inductively
and
that
its
operations
are
purely
and
distinctly
deductive
but
the
testimony
of
many
eminent
scientists
inventors
and
philosophers
is
directly
to
the
contrary
in
this
connection
the
following
quotation
from
thomson
is
interesting
the
system
of
anatomy
which
has
immortalized
the
name
of
oken
is
the
consequence
of
a
flash
of
anticipation
which
glanced
through
his
mind
when
he
picked
up
in
a
chance
walk
the
skull
of
a
deer
bleached
and
disintegrated
by
the
weather
and
exclaimed
after
a
glance
is
part
of
a
vertebral
column
when
newton
saw
the
apple
fall
the
anticipatory
question
flashed
through
his
mind
do
not
the
heavenly
bodies
fall
like
this
apple
in
neither
case
had
accident
any
important
share
newton
and
oken
were
prepared
by
the
deepest
previous
study
to
seize
upon
the
unimportant
fact
offered
to
them
and
to
show
how
important
it
might
become
and
if
the
apple
and
the
had
been
wanting
some
other
falling
body
or
some
other
skull
would
have
touched
the
string
so
ready
to
vibrate
but
in
each
case
there
was
a
great
step
of
anticipation
oken
thought
he
saw
a
type
of
the
whole
skeleton
in
a
single
vertebra
while
newton
conceived
at
once
that
the
whole
universe
was
full
of
bodies
tending
to
fall
the
discovery
of
goethe
which
did
for
the
vegetable
kingdom
what
oken
did
for
the
animal
that
the
parts
of
a
plant
are
to
be
regarded
as
metamorphosed
leaves
is
an
apparent
exception
to
the
necessity
of
discipline
for
invention
since
it
was
the
discovery
of
a
poet
in
a
region
to
which
he
seemed
to
have
paid
no
especial
or
laborious
attention
but
goethe
was
himself
most
anxious
to
rest
the
basis
of
this
discovery
upon
his
observation
rather
than
his
imagination
and
doubtless
with
good
reason
as
with
other
great
discoveries
hints
had
been
given
already
though
not
pursued
both
of
goethe
and
oken
principles
goethe
left
his
to
be
followed
up
by
others
and
but
for
his
great
fame
perhaps
his
name
would
never
have
been
connected
with
it
oken
had
amassed
all
the
materials
necessary
for
the
establishment
of
his
theory
he
was
able
at
once
to
discover
and
conquer
the
new
territory
it
must
not
be
supposed
however
that
all
hypotheses
flashing
into
the
field
of
consciousness
from
the
subconsciousness
are
necessarily
true
or
correct
on
the
contrary
many
of
them
are
incorrect
or
at
least
only
partially
correct
the
subconsciousness
is
not
infallible
or
omniscient
it
merely
produces
results
according
to
the
material
furnished
it
but
even
these
faulty
hypotheses
are
often
of
value
in
the
later
formation
of
a
correct
one
as
whewell
says
to
try
wrong
guesses
is
with
most
persons
the
only
way
to
hit
upon
right
ones
kepler
is
said
to
have
erected
at
least
twenty
hypotheses
regarding
the
shape
of
the
earth
orbit
before
he
finally
evolved
the
correct
one
as
brooks
says
even
incorrect
hypotheses
may
be
of
use
in
scientific
research
since
they
may
lead
to
more
correct
suppositions
the
supposition
of
the
circular
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
around
the
as
a
center
which
lead
to
the
conception
of
epicycles
and
at
last
to
the
true
theory
is
an
illustration
of
this
so
the
of
phlogiston
in
chemistry
made
many
facts
intelligible
before
the
true
one
of
superseded
it
and
so
as
thomson
says
with
the
theory
that
abhors
a
vacuum
which
served
to
bring
together
so
many
cognate
facts
not
previously
considered
as
related
even
an
incorrect
conception
of
this
kind
has
its
place
in
science
so
long
as
it
is
applicable
to
the
facts
when
facts
occur
which
it
can
not
explain
we
either
correct
it
or
replace
it
with
a
new
one
the
pathway
of
science
some
one
remarks
is
strewn
with
the
remains
of
discarded
hypotheses
halleck
says
regarding
the
danger
of
hasty
inference
men
must
constantly
employ
imperfect
induction
in
order
to
advance
but
great
dangers
attend
inductive
inferences
made
from
too
narrow
experience
a
child
has
experience
with
one
or
two
dogs
at
his
home
because
of
their
gentleness
he
argues
that
all
dogs
are
gentle
he
does
not
perhaps
find
out
the
contrary
until
he
has
been
severely
bitten
his
induction
was
too
hasty
he
had
not
tested
a
sufficiently
large
number
of
dogs
to
form
such
a
conclusion
from
one
or
two
experiences
with
a
large
crop
in
a
certain
latitude
a
farmer
may
argue
that
the
crop
will
generally
be
profitable
whereas
it
may
not
again
prove
so
for
years
a
man
may
have
trusted
a
number
of
people
and
found
them
honest
he
concludes
that
people
as
a
rule
are
honest
trusts
a
certain
dishonest
man
and
is
ruined
the
older
people
grow
the
more
cautious
they
generally
become
in
forming
inductive
conclusions
many
instances
are
noted
and
compared
but
even
the
wisest
sometimes
make
mistakes
it
once
was
a
generally
accepted
fact
that
all
swans
were
white
nobody
had
ever
seen
a
dark
swan
and
the
inference
that
all
swans
were
white
was
regarded
as
certainly
true
black
swans
were
however
found
in
australia
brooks
says
regarding
the
probability
of
hypotheses
the
probability
of
a
hypothesis
is
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
facts
and
phenomena
it
will
explain
the
larger
the
number
of
facts
and
phenomena
that
it
will
satisfactorily
account
for
the
greater
our
faith
in
the
correctness
of
our
supposition
if
there
is
more
than
one
hypothesis
in
respect
to
the
facts
under
consideration
that
one
which
accounts
for
the
greatest
number
of
facts
is
the
most
probable
in
order
to
verify
a
hypothesis
it
must
be
shown
that
it
will
account
for
all
the
facts
and
phenomena
if
these
facts
are
numerous
and
varied
and
the
subject
is
so
thoroughly
investigated
that
it
is
quite
certain
that
no
important
class
of
facts
has
been
overlooked
the
supposition
is
regarded
as
true
and
the
hypothesis
is
said
to
be
verified
thus
the
hypothesis
of
the
rotation
of
the
earth
on
its
axis
to
account
for
the
succession
of
day
and
night
is
accepted
as
absolutely
true
this
is
the
view
taken
by
whewell
and
many
other
thinkers
in
respect
to
the
verification
of
a
hypothesis
some
writers
however
as
mill
and
his
school
maintain
that
in
order
to
verify
a
hypothesis
we
must
show
not
only
that
it
explains
all
the
facts
and
phenomena
but
that
there
is
no
other
possible
hypothesis
which
will
account
for
them
the
former
view
of
verification
is
regarded
as
the
correct
one
by
the
latter
view
it
is
evident
that
a
hypothesis
could
never
be
verified
jevons
says
in
the
fourth
step
verification
we
proceed
to
compare
these
deductions
with
the
facts
already
collected
or
when
necessary
and
practicable
we
make
new
observations
and
plan
new
experiments
so
as
to
find
out
whether
the
hypothesis
agrees
with
nature
if
we
meet
with
several
distinct
disagreements
between
our
deductions
and
our
observations
it
will
become
likely
that
the
hypothesis
is
wrong
and
we
must
then
invent
a
new
one
in
order
to
produce
agreement
it
will
sometimes
be
enough
to
change
the
hypothesis
in
a
small
degree
when
we
get
hold
of
a
hypothesis
which
seems
to
give
results
agreeing
with
a
few
facts
we
must
not
at
once
assume
that
it
is
certainly
correct
we
must
go
on
making
other
deductions
from
it
under
various
circumstances
and
whenever
it
is
possible
we
ought
to
verify
these
results
that
is
compare
them
with
facts
observed
through
the
senses
when
a
hypothesis
is
shown
in
this
way
to
be
true
in
a
great
many
of
its
results
especially
when
it
enables
us
to
predict
what
we
should
never
otherwise
have
believed
or
discovered
it
becomes
certain
that
the
hypothesis
itself
is
a
true
one
sometimes
it
will
happen
that
two
or
even
three
quite
different
hypotheses
all
seem
to
agree
with
certain
facts
so
that
we
are
puzzled
which
to
select
when
there
are
thus
two
hypotheses
one
as
good
as
the
other
we
need
to
discover
some
fact
or
thing
which
will
agree
with
one
hypothesis
and
not
with
the
other
because
this
immediately
enables
us
to
decide
that
the
former
hypothesis
is
true
and
the
latter
false
in
the
above
statements
regarding
the
of
hypotheses
we
see
references
made
to
the
testing
of
the
latter
upon
the
facts
of
the
case
these
may
be
either
the
observed
phenomena
or
facts
apparent
to
the
perception
or
else
obtained
by
deductive
reasoning
the
latter
may
be
said
to
be
facts
which
are
held
to
be
true
if
the
hypothesis
be
true
thus
if
we
erect
the
hypothesis
that
all
men
are
mortal
we
may
reason
deductively
that
it
will
follow
that
each
and
every
thing
that
is
a
must
die
sooner
or
later
then
we
test
our
hypotheses
upon
and
every
whom
we
may
subject
to
observation
and
experiment
if
we
find
a
single
man
who
does
not
die
then
the
test
disproves
our
hypotheses
if
on
the
contrary
all
men
the
facts
in
the
case
prove
to
be
mortal
then
is
our
hypotheses
proven
or
established
the
deductive
reasoning
in
this
case
is
as
follows
is
true
regarding
a
class
and
if
this
particular
thing
belongs
to
that
class
then
it
will
follow
that
is
true
regarding
this
particular
thing
this
argument
is
expressed
in
what
is
called
a
hypothetical
proposition
see
chapter
ix
the
consideration
of
which
forms
a
part
of
the
general
subject
of
deductive
reasoning
therefore
as
jevons
has
said
deductive
reasoning
is
the
third
step
in
inductive
reasoning
and
precedes
verification
which
we
have
already
considered
halleck
says
after
induction
has
classified
certain
phenomena
and
thus
given
us
a
major
premise
we
may
proceed
to
apply
the
inference
to
any
new
specimen
that
can
be
shown
to
belong
to
that
class
induction
hands
over
to
deduction
a
major
premise
deduction
takes
that
as
a
fact
making
no
inquiry
about
its
truth
only
after
general
laws
have
been
laid
down
after
objects
have
been
classified
after
major
premises
have
been
formed
can
be
employed
in
view
of
the
above
facts
we
shall
now
proceed
to
a
consideration
of
that
great
class
of
reasoning
known
under
the
term
deductive
reasoning
chapter
xv
deductive
reasoning
we
have
seen
that
there
are
two
great
classes
of
reasoning
known
respectively
as
inductive
reasoning
or
the
discovery
of
general
truth
from
particular
truths
and
deductive
reasoning
or
the
discovery
of
particular
truths
from
general
truths
as
we
have
said
deductive
reasoning
is
the
process
of
discovering
particular
truths
from
a
general
truth
thus
from
the
general
truth
embodied
in
the
proposition
all
horses
are
animals
when
it
is
considered
in
connection
with
the
secondary
proposition
that
dobbin
is
a
horse
we
are
able
to
deduce
the
particular
truth
that
dobbin
is
an
animal
or
in
the
following
case
we
deduce
a
particular
truth
from
a
general
truth
as
follows
all
mushrooms
are
good
to
eat
this
fungus
is
a
mushroom
therefore
this
fungus
is
good
to
eat
a
deductive
argument
is
expressed
in
a
deductive
syllogism
jevons
says
regarding
the
last
stated
illustration
here
are
three
sentences
which
state
three
different
facts
but
when
we
know
the
two
first
facts
we
learn
or
gather
the
third
fact
from
the
other
two
when
we
thus
learn
one
fact
from
other
facts
we
or
and
we
do
this
in
the
mind
reasoning
thus
enables
us
to
ascertain
the
nature
of
a
thing
without
actual
trial
if
we
always
needed
to
taste
a
thing
before
we
could
know
whether
it
was
good
to
eat
or
not
cases
of
poisoning
would
be
alarmingly
frequent
but
the
appearance
and
peculiarities
of
a
mushroom
may
be
safely
learned
by
the
eye
or
the
nose
and
reasoning
upon
this
information
and
the
fact
already
well
known
that
mushrooms
are
good
to
eat
we
arrive
without
any
danger
or
trouble
at
the
conclusion
that
the
particular
fungus
before
us
is
good
to
eat
reason
then
is
to
get
some
knowledge
from
other
the
student
will
recognize
that
deductive
reasoning
is
essentially
analytic
because
it
operates
in
the
direction
of
analyzing
a
universal
or
general
truth
into
its
particulars
into
the
particular
parts
which
are
included
within
it
and
asserting
of
them
that
what
is
true
of
the
general
is
true
of
the
particular
thus
in
the
general
truth
that
all
men
are
mortal
we
see
included
the
particular
truth
that
john
smith
is
mortal
john
smith
having
been
discovered
to
be
a
man
we
deduce
the
particular
truth
about
john
smith
from
the
general
truth
about
all
men
we
analyze
all
men
and
find
john
smith
to
be
one
of
its
particular
parts
therefore
deduction
is
an
inference
from
the
whole
to
its
parts
that
is
an
analytic
process
the
student
will
also
recognize
that
deductive
reasoning
is
essentially
descending
because
it
operates
in
the
direction
of
a
descent
from
the
universal
to
the
particular
from
the
higher
to
the
lower
from
the
broader
to
the
narrower
as
brooks
says
deduction
descends
from
higher
truths
to
lower
truths
from
laws
to
facts
from
causes
to
phenomena
etc
given
the
law
we
can
by
deduction
descend
to
the
facts
that
fall
under
the
law
even
if
we
have
never
before
seen
the
facts
and
so
from
the
cause
we
may
pass
down
to
observed
and
even
unknown
phenomena
the
general
truths
which
are
used
as
the
basis
of
deductive
reasoning
are
discovered
in
several
ways
the
majority
arise
from
inductive
reasoning
based
upon
experience
observation
and
experiment
for
instance
in
the
examples
given
above
we
could
not
truthfully
assert
our
belief
that
all
horses
are
animals
unless
we
had
previously
studied
both
the
horse
and
animals
in
general
nor
without
this
study
could
we
state
that
dobbin
is
a
horse
nor
could
we
without
previous
study
experience
and
experiment
truthfully
assert
that
all
mushrooms
are
good
to
eat
or
that
this
fungus
is
a
mushroom
and
that
therefore
this
fungus
is
good
to
eat
even
as
it
is
we
must
be
sure
that
the
fungus
really
is
a
mushroom
else
we
run
a
risk
of
poisoning
ourselves
general
truths
of
this
kind
are
by
any
means
but
are
based
upon
our
own
experience
or
the
experience
of
others
there
is
a
class
of
general
truths
which
are
called
by
some
authorities
halleck
says
of
these
some
psychologists
claim
that
we
have
knowledge
obtained
neither
through
induction
nor
deduction
that
we
recognize
certain
truths
the
moment
we
perceive
certain
objects
without
any
process
of
inference
under
the
head
of
intuitive
knowledge
are
classified
such
cases
as
the
following
we
perceive
an
object
and
immediately
know
that
it
is
a
time
relation
as
existing
now
and
then
we
are
said
to
have
an
intuitive
concept
of
time
when
we
are
told
that
the
whole
is
greater
than
a
part
that
things
equal
to
the
same
thing
are
equal
to
each
other
that
a
straight
line
can
not
enclose
space
we
or
intuitively
recognize
the
truth
of
these
statements
attempts
at
proof
do
not
make
us
feel
surer
of
their
truth
we
say
that
it
is
or
that
we
know
the
fact
intuitively
the
axioms
of
mathematics
and
logic
are
said
to
be
intuitive
another
class
of
authorities
however
deny
the
nature
of
intuitive
knowledge
of
truth
or
intuitive
truths
they
claim
that
all
our
ideas
arise
from
sensation
and
reflection
and
that
what
we
call
intuition
is
merely
the
result
of
sensation
and
reflection
by
memory
or
they
hold
that
the
of
animals
and
men
are
simply
the
representation
of
experiences
of
the
race
or
individual
arising
from
the
impressions
stored
away
in
the
subconsciousness
of
the
individual
halleck
states
regarding
this
this
school
likens
intuition
to
instinct
it
grants
that
the
young
duck
knows
water
instinctively
plunges
into
it
and
swims
without
learning
these
psychologists
believe
that
there
was
a
time
when
this
was
not
the
case
with
the
progenitors
of
the
duck
they
had
to
gain
this
knowledge
slowly
through
experience
those
that
learned
the
proper
aquatic
lesson
survived
and
transmitted
this
knowledge
through
a
modified
structure
to
their
progeny
those
that
failed
in
the
lesson
perished
in
the
struggle
for
existence
this
school
claims
that
the
intuition
of
cause
and
effect
arose
in
the
same
way
generations
of
human
beings
have
seen
the
cause
invariably
joined
to
the
effect
hence
through
inseparable
association
came
the
recognition
of
their
necessary
sequence
the
tendency
to
regard
all
phenomena
in
these
relations
was
with
steadily
increasing
force
transmitted
by
the
laws
of
heredity
to
posterity
until
the
recognition
of
the
relationship
has
become
an
intuition
another
class
of
general
truths
is
merely
hypothetical
hypothetical
means
founded
on
or
including
a
hypothesis
or
supposition
assumed
or
taken
for
granted
though
not
proved
for
the
purpose
of
deducing
proofs
of
a
point
in
question
the
hypotheses
and
theories
of
physical
science
are
used
as
general
truths
for
deductive
reasoning
hypothetical
general
truths
are
in
the
nature
of
premises
assumed
in
order
to
proceed
with
the
process
of
deductive
reasoning
and
without
which
such
reasoning
would
be
impossible
they
are
however
as
a
rule
not
mere
assumptions
but
are
rather
in
the
nature
of
assumptions
rendered
plausible
by
experience
experiment
and
inductive
reasoning
the
law
of
gravitation
may
be
considered
hypothetical
and
yet
it
is
the
result
of
inductive
reasoning
based
upon
a
vast
multitude
of
facts
and
phenomena
the
basis
of
deductive
may
be
said
to
rest
upon
the
logical
axiom
which
has
come
down
to
us
from
the
ancients
and
which
is
stated
as
follows
is
true
of
the
whole
is
true
of
its
or
as
later
authorities
have
expressed
it
whatever
is
true
of
the
general
is
true
of
the
particular
this
axiom
is
the
basis
upon
which
we
build
our
deductive
reasoning
it
furnishes
us
with
the
validity
of
the
deductive
inference
or
argument
if
we
are
challenged
for
proof
of
the
statement
that
this
fungus
is
good
to
eat
we
are
able
to
answer
that
we
are
justified
in
making
the
statement
by
the
proposition
or
axiom
that
whatever
is
true
of
the
general
is
true
of
the
particular
if
the
general
mushroom
is
good
to
eat
then
the
particular
this
fungus
being
a
mushroom
must
also
be
good
to
eat
all
horses
general
being
animals
then
according
to
the
axiom
dobbin
particular
horse
must
also
be
an
animal
this
axiom
has
been
stated
in
various
terms
other
than
those
stated
above
for
instance
whatever
may
be
affirmed
or
denied
of
the
whole
may
be
denied
or
affirmed
of
the
parts
which
form
is
evidently
derived
from
that
used
by
hamilton
who
said
what
belongs
or
does
not
belong
to
the
containing
whole
belongs
or
does
not
belong
to
each
of
the
contained
parts
aristotle
formulated
his
celebrated
dictum
as
follows
whatever
can
be
predicated
affirmatively
or
negatively
of
any
class
or
term
distributed
can
be
predicated
in
like
manner
of
all
and
singular
the
classes
or
individuals
contained
under
it
there
is
another
form
of
deductive
reasoning
that
is
a
form
based
upon
another
axiom
than
that
of
whatever
is
true
of
the
whole
is
true
of
the
parts
this
form
of
reasoning
is
sometimes
called
mathematical
reasoning
because
it
is
the
form
of
reasoning
employed
in
mathematics
its
axiom
is
stated
as
follows
things
which
are
equal
to
the
same
thing
are
equal
to
one
another
it
will
be
seen
that
this
is
the
principle
employed
in
mathematics
thus
x
equals
y
and
y
equals
therefore
x
equals
or
stated
in
logical
terms
a
equals
b
b
equals
c
therefore
a
equals
thus
it
is
seen
that
this
form
of
reasoning
as
well
as
the
ordinary
form
of
deductive
reasoning
is
strictly
that
is
made
through
the
medium
of
a
third
thing
or
two
things
being
compared
through
their
relation
to
a
third
brooks
states
the
real
reason
for
the
certainty
of
mathematical
reasoning
may
be
stated
as
follows
first
its
ideas
are
definite
necessary
and
exact
conceptions
of
quantity
second
its
definitions
as
the
description
of
these
ideas
are
necessary
exact
and
indisputable
truths
third
the
axioms
from
which
we
derive
conclusions
by
comparison
are
all
and
necessary
truths
comparing
these
exact
ideas
by
the
necessary
laws
of
inference
the
result
must
be
absolutely
true
or
stated
in
another
way
using
these
definitions
and
axioms
as
the
premises
of
a
syllogism
the
conclusion
follows
inevitably
there
is
no
place
or
opportunity
for
error
to
creep
in
to
mar
or
vitiate
our
derived
truths
in
conclusion
we
wish
to
call
your
attention
to
a
passage
from
jevons
which
is
worthy
of
consideration
and
recollection
jevons
says
there
is
a
simple
rule
which
will
enable
us
to
test
the
truth
of
a
great
many
arguments
even
of
many
which
do
not
come
under
any
of
the
rules
commonly
given
in
books
on
logic
this
rule
is
that
is
true
of
one
term
is
true
of
any
term
which
is
stated
to
be
the
same
in
meaning
as
that
in
other
words
we
may
always
one
term
for
another
if
we
know
that
they
refer
to
exactly
the
same
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
horse
is
some
animal
and
therefore
the
head
of
a
horse
is
the
head
of
some
animal
this
argument
can
not
be
brought
under
the
rules
of
the
syllogism
because
it
contains
four
distinct
logical
terms
in
two
propositions
namely
horse
some
animal
head
of
horse
head
of
some
animal
but
it
easily
comes
under
the
rule
which
i
have
given
because
we
have
simply
to
put
animal
instead
of
horse
a
great
many
arguments
may
be
explained
in
this
way
gold
is
a
metal
therefore
a
piece
of
gold
is
a
piece
of
metal
a
negro
is
a
fellow
creature
therefore
he
who
strikes
a
negro
strikes
a
fellow
creature
the
same
eminent
authority
says
when
we
examine
carefully
enough
the
way
in
which
we
reason
it
will
be
found
every
case
to
consist
in
putting
one
thing
or
term
in
place
of
another
to
which
we
know
it
to
have
an
exact
resemblance
in
some
we
use
the
likeness
as
a
kind
of
bridge
which
leads
us
from
a
knowledge
of
one
thing
to
a
knowledge
of
another
thus
true
principle
of
reasoning
may
be
called
the
substitution
of
similars
or
the
passing
from
like
to
we
infer
the
character
of
one
thing
from
the
character
of
something
which
acts
as
a
or
third
term
when
we
are
certain
there
is
an
exact
likeness
our
inference
is
certain
when
we
only
believe
that
there
probably
is
or
guess
that
there
is
then
our
inferences
are
only
probable
not
certain
chapter

the
syllogism
the
third
and
highest
phase
or
step
in
reasoning
the
step
which
follows
after
those
styled
conception
and
judgment
is
generally
known
by
the
general
term
reasoning
which
term
however
is
used
to
include
the
two
precedent
steps
as
well
as
the
final
step
itself
this
step
or
process
consists
of
the
comparing
of
two
objects
persons
or
things
through
their
relation
to
a
third
object
person
or
thing
as
for
instance
we
reason
a
that
all
mammals
are
animals
b
that
a
horse
is
a
mammal
and
c
that
a
horse
is
an
animal
the
most
fundamental
principle
of
this
step
or
reasoning
consists
in
the
comparing
of
two
objects
of
thought
through
and
by
means
of
their
relation
to
a
third
object
the
natural
form
of
expression
of
this
process
of
reasoning
is
called
a
syllogism
the
process
of
reasoning
which
gives
rise
to
the
expression
of
the
argument
in
the
form
of
a
syllogism
must
be
understood
if
one
wishes
to
form
a
clear
conception
of
the
syllogism
the
process
itself
is
very
simple
when
plainly
stated
although
the
beginner
is
sometimes
puzzled
by
the
complicated
definitions
and
statements
of
the
authorities
let
us
suppose
that
we
have
three
objects
a
b
and
c
respectively
we
wish
to
compare
c
and
b
but
fail
to
establish
a
relation
between
them
at
first
we
however
are
able
to
establish
a
relation
between
a
and
b
and
between
c
and
a
we
thus
have
the
two
propositions
a
equals
b
and
c
equals
a
the
next
step
is
that
of
inferring
that
if
a
equals
b
and
c
equals
a
then
it
must
follow
logically
c
equals
this
process
is
that
of
indirect
or
mediate
comparison
rather
than
c
and
b
are
not
compared
directly
or
immediately
but
indirectly
and
through
the
medium
of
a
a
is
thus
said
to
between
b
and
this
process
of
reasoning
embraces
three
ideas
or
objects
of
thought
in
their
expression
of
propositions
it
comprises
the
fundamental
or
elemental
form
of
reasoning
as
brooks
says
the
simplest
movement
of
the
reasoning
process
is
the
comparing
of
two
objects
through
their
relation
to
a
third
the
result
of
this
process
is
an
argument
expressed
in
what
is
called
a
syllogism
whately
says
that
a
syllogism
is
an
argument
expressed
in
strict
logical
form
so
that
its
conclusiveness
is
manifest
from
the
structure
of
the
expression
alone
without
any
regard
to
the
meaning
of
the
terms
brooks
says
all
reasoning
can
be
and
naturally
is
expressed
in
the
form
of
the
syllogism
it
applies
to
both
inductive
and
deductive
reasoning
and
is
the
form
in
which
these
processes
are
presented
its
importance
as
an
instrument
of
thought
requires
that
it
receive
special
notice
in
order
that
the
nature
and
use
of
the
syllogism
may
be
clearly
understood
we
can
do
no
better
than
to
at
once
present
for
your
consideration
the
rules
of
the
syllogism
an
understanding
of
which
carries
with
it
a
perfect
comprehension
of
the
syllogism
itself
the
rules
of
the
syllogism
state
that
in
order
for
a
syllogism
to
be
a
syllogism
it
is
necessary
i
there
should
be
three
and
no
more
than
three
these
three
propositions
are
the
or
thing
to
be
proved
and
and
the
premises
or
the
means
of
proving
the
conclusion
and
which
are
called
the
major
premise
and
minor
premise
respectively
we
may
understand
this
more
clearly
if
we
will
examine
the
following
example
man
is
mortal
or
a
is
b
socrates
is
a
man
or
c
is
a
therefore
socrates
is
mortal
or
c
is
b
it
will
be
seen
that
the
above
syllogism
whether
expressed
in
words
or
symbols
is
logically
valid
because
the
conclusion
must
logically
follow
the
premises
and
in
this
case
the
premises
being
true
it
must
follow
that
the
conclusion
is
true
whately
says
a
syllogism
is
said
to
be
valid
when
the
conclusion
logically
follows
from
the
premises
if
the
conclusion
does
not
so
follow
the
syllogism
is
invalid
and
constitutes
a
fallacy
if
the
error
deceives
the
reasoner
himself
but
if
it
is
advanced
with
the
idea
of
deceiving
others
it
constitutes
a
sophism
the
reason
for
rule
i
is
that
only
three
propositions
a
major
premise
a
minor
premise
and
a
conclusion
are
needed
to
form
a
syllogism
if
we
have
more
than
propositions
then
we
must
have
more
than
two
premises
from
which
to
draw
one
conclusion
the
presence
of
more
than
two
premises
would
result
in
the
formation
of
two
or
more
syllogisms
or
else
in
the
failure
to
form
a
syllogism
ii
there
should
be
three
and
no
more
than
three
these
terms
are
the
predicate
of
the
conclusion
the
subject
of
the
conclusion
and
the
middle
term
which
must
occur
in
both
premises
being
the
connecting
link
in
bringing
the
two
other
terms
together
in
the
conclusion
the
of
the
is
called
the
term
because
it
is
the
greatest
in
extension
compared
with
its
fellow
terms
the
of
the
is
called
the
term
because
it
is
the
smallest
in
extension
compared
with
its
fellow
terms
the
major
and
minor
terms
are
called
the
the
middle
term
operates
between
the
two
extremes
the
and
the
must
appear
in
the
the
and
the
must
appear
in
the
the
and
the
must
appear
in
the
thus
we
see
that
major
must
be
the
predicate
of
the
conclusion
the
the
subject
of
the
conclusion
the
may
be
the
subject
or
predicate
either
of
the
but
always
be
found
once
in
both
the
following
example
will
show
this
arrangement
more
clearly
in
the
syllogism
man
is
mortal
socrates
is
a
man
therefore
socrates
is
mortal
we
have
the
following
arrangement
mortal
the
major
term
socrates
the
minor
term
and
man
the
middle
term
as
follows
man
is
mortal
socrates
is
a
man
socrates
is
mortal
the
reason
for
the
rule
that
there
shall
be
terms
is
that
reasoning
consists
in
comparing
with
each
other
through
the
medium
of
a
there
three
terms
if
there
are
than
three
terms
we
form
two
syllogisms
instead
of
one
iii
one
premise
at
least
must
be
this
because
from
two
negative
propositions
nothing
can
be
inferred
a
negative
proposition
asserts
that
two
things
differ
and
if
we
have
two
propositions
so
asserting
difference
we
can
infer
nothing
from
them
if
our
syllogism
stated
that
man
is
mortal
and
that
socrates
is
a
man
we
could
form
no
conclusion
either
that
socrates
or
mortal
there
would
be
no
logical
connection
between
the
two
premises
and
therefore
no
conclusion
could
be
deduced
therefrom
therefore
at
least
one
premise
must
be
affirmative
iv
one
premise
is
negative
the
conclusion
must
be
this
because
if
one
term
agrees
and
another
disagrees
with
a
third
term
they
must
disagree
with
each
other
thus
if
our
syllogism
stated
that
man
is
mortal
and
that
socrates
is
a
man
we
must
announce
the
negative
conclusion
that
socrates
is
mortal
the
middle
term
must
be
distributed
that
is
taken
universally
in
at
least
one
this
because
otherwise
the
major
term
may
be
compared
with
one
part
of
the
middle
term
and
the
minor
term
with
another
part
of
the
latter
and
there
will
be
actually
no
common
middle
term
and
consequently
no
common
ground
for
an
inference
the
violation
of
this
rule
causes
what
is
commonly
known
as
the
undistributed
middle
a
celebrated
fallacy
condemned
by
the
logicians
in
the
syllogism
mentioned
as
an
example
in
this
chapter
the
proposition
is
mortal
really
means
men
that
is
man
in
his
universal
sense
literally
the
proposition
is
all
men
are
mortal
from
which
it
is
seen
that
socrates
being
man
or
of
men
must
partake
of
the
quality
of
the
universal
man
if
the
syllogism
instead
read
men
are
mortal
it
would
not
follow
that
socrates
be
mortal
he
might
or
might
not
be
so
another
form
of
this
fallacy
is
shown
in
the
statement
that
white
is
a
color
black
is
a
color
hence
black
must
be
white
the
two
premises
mean
white
is
color
black
is
color
and
not
that
either
is
colors
another
example
is
men
are
bipeds
birds
are
bipeds
hence
men
are
birds
in
this
example
bipeds
is
not
distributed
as
bipeds
but
is
simply
as
bipeds
these
syllogisms
therefore
not
being
according
to
rule
must
fail
they
are
not
true
syllogisms
and
constitute
fallacies
to
be
the
middle
term
must
be
the
subject
of
a
universal
proposition
or
the
predicate
of
a
negative
proposition
to
be
it
must
be
the
subject
of
a
particular
proposition
or
the
predicate
of
an
affirmative
proposition
see
chapter
on
propositions
vi
an
extreme
if
undistributed
in
a
premise
may
not
be
distributed
in
the
this
because
it
would
be
illogical
and
unreasonable
to
assert
more
in
the
conclusion
than
we
find
in
the
premises
it
would
be
most
illogical
to
argue
that
all
horses
are
animals
no
man
is
a
horse
therefore
no
man
is
an
animal
the
conclusion
would
be
invalid
because
the
term
is
distributed
in
the
conclusion
being
the
predicate
of
a
negative
proposition
while
it
is
not
distributed
in
the
premise
being
the
predicate
of
an
affirmative
proposition
as
we
have
said
before
any
syllogism
which
violates
any
of
the
above
six
syllogisms
is
invalid
and
a
fallacy
there
are
two
additional
rules
which
may
be
called
derivative
any
syllogism
which
violates
either
of
these
two
derivative
rules
also
violates
one
or
more
of
the
first
six
rules
as
given
above
in
detail
the
derivative
rules
of
the
are
as
follows
vii
one
premise
at
least
must
be
this
because
from
two
particular
premises
no
conclusion
can
be
drawn
viii
if
one
premise
is
particular
the
conclusion
must
be
particular
this
because
only
a
universal
conclusion
can
be
drawn
from
two
universal
premises
the
principles
involved
in
these
two
derivative
rules
may
be
tested
by
stating
syllogisms
violating
them
they
contain
the
essence
of
the
other
rules
and
every
syllogism
which
breaks
them
will
be
found
to
also
break
one
or
more
of
the
other
rules
given
chapter
xvii
varieties
of
syllogisms
the
authorities
in
logic
hold
that
with
the
four
kinds
of
propositions
grouped
in
every
possible
order
of
arrangement
it
is
possible
to
form
nineteen
different
kinds
of
valid
arguments
which
are
called
the
moods
of
the
these
are
classified
by
division
into
what
are
called
four
each
of
which
figures
may
be
known
by
the
position
of
the
middle
term
in
the
premises
logicians
have
arranged
elaborate
and
curious
tables
constructed
to
show
what
kinds
of
propositions
when
joined
in
a
particular
order
of
arrangement
will
make
sound
and
valid
syllogisms
we
shall
not
set
forth
these
tables
here
as
they
are
too
technical
for
a
popular
presentation
of
the
subject
before
us
and
because
they
are
not
necessary
to
the
student
who
will
thoroughly
familiarize
himself
with
the
above
stated
laws
of
the
syllogism
and
who
will
therefore
be
able
to
determine
in
every
case
whether
any
given
argument
is
a
correct
syllogism
or
otherwise
in
many
instances
of
ordinary
thought
and
expression
the
syllogistic
form
is
omitted
or
not
stated
at
full
length
it
is
common
usage
to
omit
one
premise
of
a
syllogism
in
ordinary
expression
the
missing
premise
being
inferred
by
the
speaker
and
hearer
a
syllogism
with
one
premise
unexpressed
is
sometimes
called
an
the
term
meaning
in
the
mind
for
instance
the
following
we
are
a
free
people
therefore
we
are
happy
the
major
premise
all
free
people
are
happy
being
omitted
or
unexpressed
also
in
poets
are
imaginative
therefore
byron
was
imaginative
the
minor
premise
byron
was
a
poet
is
omitted
or
unexpressed
jevons
says
regarding
this
phase
of
the
subject
thus
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
the
verses
known
as
the
beatitudes
consist
each
of
one
premise
and
a
conclusion
and
the
conclusion
is
put
first
are
the
merciful
for
they
shall
obtain
mercy
the
subject
and
the
predicate
of
the
conclusion
are
here
inverted
so
that
the
proposition
is
really
merciful
are
blessed
it
is
evidently
that
who
shall
obtain
mercy
are
blessed
so
that
the
syllogism
when
stated
at
full
length
becomes
who
shall
obtain
mercy
are
blessed
all
who
are
merciful
shall
obtain
mercy
therefore
all
who
are
merciful
are
blessed
this
is
a
perfectly
good
syllogism
whenever
we
find
any
of
the
words
or
similar
terms
we
may
know
that
there
is
an
argument
and
usually
a
syllogism
we
have
seen
that
there
are
three
special
kinds
of
propositions
namely
categorical
propositions
or
propositions
in
which
the
affirmation
or
denial
is
made
without
reservation
or
qualification
hypothetical
propositions
in
which
the
affirmation
or
denial
is
made
to
depend
upon
certain
conditions
circumstances
or
suppositions
and
disjunctive
propositions
in
which
is
implied
or
asserted
an
the
forms
of
reasoning
based
upon
these
three
several
classes
of
propositions
bear
the
same
names
as
the
latter
and
accordingly
the
respective
syllogisms
expressing
these
forms
of
reasoning
also
bear
the
class
name
or
term
thus
a
categorical
syllogism
is
one
containing
only
categorical
propositions
a
hypothetical
syllogism
is
one
containing
one
or
more
hypothetical
propositions
a
disjunctive
syllogism
is
one
containing
a
disjunctive
proposition
in
the
major
premise
which
are
far
more
common
than
the
other
two
kinds
have
been
considered
in
the
previous
chapter
and
the
majority
of
the
examples
of
syllogisms
given
in
this
book
are
of
this
kind
in
a
categorical
syllogism
the
statement
or
denial
is
made
positively
and
without
reservation
or
qualification
and
the
reasoning
thereupon
partakes
of
the
same
positive
character
in
propositions
or
syllogisms
of
this
kind
it
is
asserted
or
assumed
that
the
premise
is
true
and
correct
and
if
the
reasoning
be
logically
correct
it
must
follow
that
the
conclusion
is
correct
and
the
new
proposition
springing
therefrom
must
likewise
be
categorical
in
its
nature
on
the
contrary
have
as
one
or
more
of
their
premises
a
hypothetical
proposition
which
affirms
or
asserts
something
provided
or
if
something
else
be
true
hyslop
says
of
this
often
we
wish
first
to
bring
out
if
only
conditionally
the
truth
upon
which
a
proposition
rests
so
as
to
see
if
the
connection
between
this
conclusion
and
the
major
premise
be
admitted
the
whole
question
will
then
depend
upon
the
matter
of
treating
the
minor
premise
this
has
the
advantage
of
getting
the
major
premise
admitted
without
the
formal
procedure
of
proof
and
the
minor
premise
is
usually
more
easily
proved
than
the
major
consequently
one
is
made
to
see
more
clearly
the
force
of
the
argument
or
reasoning
by
removing
the
question
of
the
material
truth
of
the
major
premise
and
concentrating
attention
upon
the
relation
between
the
conclusion
and
its
conditions
so
that
we
know
clearly
what
we
have
first
to
deny
if
we
do
not
wish
to
accept
it
by
joining
a
hypothetical
proposition
with
an
ordinary
proposition
we
create
a
hypothetical
proposition
for
instance
york
contains
a
cathedral
it
is
a
city
york
contain
a
cathedral
therefore
york
is
a
city
or
if
have
four
feet
they
are
quadrupeds
dogs
have
four
feet
therefore
dogs
quadrupeds
the
hypothetical
syllogism
may
be
either
affirmative
or
negative
that
is
its
hypothetical
proposition
may
either
hypothetically
or
hypothetically
the
part
of
the
premise
of
a
hypothetical
syllogism
which
conditions
or
questions
and
which
usually
contains
the
little
word
if
is
called
the
antecedent
the
major
premise
is
the
one
usually
thus
conditioned
the
other
part
of
the
conditioned
proposition
and
which
part
states
what
will
happen
or
is
true
under
the
conditional
circumstances
is
called
the
consequent
thus
in
one
of
the
above
examples
if
dogs
have
four
feet
is
the
antecedent
and
the
remainder
of
the
proposition
they
are
quadrupeds
is
the
consequent
the
antecedent
is
indicated
by
the
presence
of
some
conditional
term
as
the
general
sense
and
meaning
of
such
terms
being
that
of
the
little
word
the
consequent
has
no
special
indicating
term
jevons
gives
the
following
clear
and
simple
regarding
the
hypothetical
i
if
the
antecedent
be
affirmed
the
consequent
may
be
affirmed
if
the
consequent
be
denied
the
antecedent
may
be
denied
ii
avoid
the
fallacy
of
affirming
the
consequent
or
denying
the
antecedent
this
is
a
fallacy
because
of
the
fact
that
the
conditional
statement
made
in
the
major
premise
not
be
the
only
determining
the
consequent
the
following
is
an
example
of
affirming
the
consequent
it
is
raining
the
sky
is
overclouded
the
sky
overclouded
therefore
it
in
truth
the
sky
may
be
overclouded
and
still
it
may
be
raining
the
fallacy
is
still
more
apparent
when
expressed
in
symbols
as
follows
a
is
b
c
is
d
c
d
therefore
a
is
b
the
fallacy
of
denying
the
antecedent
is
shown
by
the
following
example
radium
were
cheap
it
would
be
useful
radium
is
cheap
therefore
radium
useful
or
expressed
in
symbols
a
is
b
c
is
d
a
is
b
therefore
c
in
truth
radium
may
be
useful
although
not
cheap
jevons
gives
the
following
examples
of
these
fallacies
if
a
man
is
a
good
teacher
he
thoroughly
understands
his
subject
but
john
jones
thoroughly
understands
his
subject
therefore
he
is
a
good
teacher
also
if
snow
is
mixed
with
salt
it
melts
the
snow
on
the
ground
is
mixed
with
salt
therefore
it
does
melt
jevons
says
to
affirm
the
consequent
and
then
to
infer
that
we
can
affirm
the
antecedent
is
as
bad
as
breaking
the
third
rule
of
the
syllogism
and
allowing
an
undistributed
middle
term
to
deny
the
antecedent
is
really
to
break
the
fourth
rule
of
the
syllogism
and
to
take
a
term
as
distributed
in
the
conclusion
which
was
not
so
in
the
premises
hypothetical
syllogisms
may
usually
be
easily
reduced
to
or
converted
into
categorical
syllogisms
as
jevons
says
in
reality
hypothetical
propositions
and
syllogisms
are
not
different
from
those
which
we
have
more
fully
considered
is
all
a
matter
of
the
convenience
of
stating
the
for
instance
instead
of
saying
if
radium
were
cheap
it
would
be
useful
we
may
say
cheap
radium
would
be
useful
or
instead
of
saying
if
glass
is
thin
it
breaks
easily
we
may
say
thin
glass
breaks
easily
hyslop
gives
the
following
for
in
such
cases
regard
the
antecedent
of
the
hypothetical
proposition
as
the
subject
of
the
categorical
and
the
consequent
of
the
hypothetical
proposition
as
the
predicate
of
the
categorical
in
some
cases
this
change
is
a
very
simple
one
in
others
it
can
be
effected
only
by
a
circumlocution
the
third
class
of
syllogisms
known
as
disjunctive
is
the
exception
to
the
law
which
holds
that
all
good
syllogisms
must
fit
in
and
come
under
the
rules
of
the
syllogism
as
stated
in
the
preceding
chapter
not
only
does
it
refuse
to
obey
these
rules
but
it
fails
to
resemble
the
ordinary
syllogism
in
many
ways
as
jevons
says
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
all
good
logical
arguments
must
obey
the
rules
of
the
syllogism
which
we
have
been
considering
only
those
arguments
which
connect
two
terms
together
by
means
of
a
middle
term
and
are
therefore
syllogisms
need
obey
these
rules
a
great
many
of
the
arguments
which
we
daily
use
are
of
this
nature
but
there
are
a
great
many
other
kinds
of
arguments
some
of
which
have
never
been
understood
by
logicians
until
recent
years
one
important
kind
of
argument
is
known
as
the
disjunctive
syllogism
though
it
does
not
obey
the
rules
of
the
syllogism
or
in
any
way
resemble
syllogisms
the
disjunctive
syllogism
is
one
having
a
disjunctive
proposition
in
its
major
premise
the
disjunctive
proposition
also
appears
in
the
conclusion
when
the
disjunction
in
the
major
premise
happens
to
contain
more
than
two
terms
a
disjunctive
proposition
we
have
seen
is
one
which
possesses
alternative
predicates
for
the
subject
in
which
the
conjunction
sometimes
accompanied
by
appears
as
for
instance
lightning
is
sheet
forked
or
arches
are
round
or
pointed
or
angles
are
either
obtuse
or
right
angled
or
acute
the
different
things
joined
together
by
or
are
called
alternatives
the
term
indicating
that
we
may
choose
between
the
things
and
that
if
one
will
not
answer
our
purpose
we
may
take
the
other
or
one
of
the
others
if
there
be
more
than
one
the
regarding
the
use
of
disjunctive
is
that
if
one
or
more
alternatives
be
denied
the
rest
may
still
be
affirmed
thus
if
we
say
that
a
is
b
or
c
or
that
a
is
either
b
or
c
we
may
the
b
but
still
affirm
the
some
authorities
also
hold
that
if
we
affirm
one
alternative
we
must
deny
the
remainder
but
this
view
is
vigorously
disputed
by
other
authorities
it
would
seem
to
be
a
valid
rule
in
cases
where
the
term
either
appears
as
a
is
b
c
because
there
seems
to
be
an
implication
that
one
or
the
other
alone
can
be
true
but
in
cases
like
a
is
b
c
there
may
be
a
possibility
of
being
jevons
takes
this
latter
view
giving
as
an
example
the
proposition
a
magistrate
is
a
a
mayor
or
a
stipendiary
magistrate
but
it
does
not
follow
that
one
who
is
a
may
not
be
at
the
same
time
a
mayor
he
states
after
affirming
one
alternative
we
can
only
deny
the
others
there
be
such
a
difference
between
them
that
they
could
not
be
true
at
the
same
it
would
seem
that
both
contentions
are
at
the
same
time
true
the
example
given
by
jevons
illustrating
his
contention
and
the
proposition
the
prisoner
is
either
guilty
or
innocent
illustrating
the
contentions
of
the
other
side
a
is
a
conditional
syllogism
whose
major
premise
presents
some
sort
of
alternative
whately
defines
it
as
a
conditional
syllogism
with
two
or
more
antecedents
in
the
major
and
a
disjunctive
minor
there
being
two
mutually
exclusive
propositions
in
the
major
premise
the
reasoner
is
compelled
to
admit
one
or
the
other
and
is
then
caught
between
the
two
horns
of
the
dilemma
chapter
xviii
reasoning
by
analogy
what
is
called
reasoning
by
analogy
is
one
of
the
most
elementary
forms
of
reasoning
and
the
one
which
the
majority
of
us
most
frequently
employ
it
is
a
primitive
form
of
hasty
generalization
evidencing
in
the
natural
expectation
that
things
will
happen
as
they
have
happened
before
in
like
circumstances
the
term
as
used
in
logic
has
been
defined
as
resemblance
of
relations
resemblances
of
any
kind
on
which
an
argument
falling
short
of
induction
may
be
founded
brooks
says
analogy
is
that
process
of
thought
by
which
we
infer
that
if
two
things
resemble
each
other
in
one
or
more
particulars
they
will
resemble
each
other
in
some
other
particular
jevons
states
the
for
reasoning
by
as
follows
if
two
or
more
things
resemble
each
other
in
many
points
they
will
probably
resemble
each
other
also
in
more
points
others
have
stated
the
same
principle
as
follows
when
one
thing
resembles
another
in
known
particulars
it
will
resemble
it
also
in
the
unknown
and
if
two
things
agree
in
several
particulars
they
will
also
agree
in
other
particulars
there
is
a
difference
between
generalization
by
induction
and
by
analogy
in
inductive
generalization
the
rule
is
what
is
true
of
the
many
is
true
of
all
while
the
rule
of
analogy
is
things
that
have
some
things
in
common
have
other
things
in
common
as
jevons
aptly
remarks
reasoning
by
analogy
differs
only
in
degree
from
that
kind
of
reasoning
called
when
resemble
each
other
in
a
we
argue
about
them
by
generalization
when
a
resemble
each
other
in
it
is
a
case
of
analogy
illustrating
analogy
we
may
say
that
if
in
a
we
find
the
qualities
attributes
or
properties
called
respectively
and
if
we
find
that
in
b
the
qualities
called
respectively
are
present
then
we
may
reason
by
analogy
that
the
qualities
and
must
also
belong
to
brooks
says
of
this
form
of
reasoning
this
principle
is
in
constant
application
in
ordinary
life
and
in
science
a
physician
in
visiting
a
patient
says
this
disease
corresponds
in
several
particulars
with
typhoid
fever
hence
it
will
correspond
in
particulars
and
typhoid
fever
so
when
the
geologist
discovers
a
fossil
animal
with
large
strong
blunt
claws
he
infers
that
it
procured
its
food
by
scratching
or
burrowing
in
the
earth
it
was
by
analogy
that
buckland
constructed
an
animal
from
a
few
fossil
bones
and
when
subsequently
the
bones
of
the
entire
animal
were
discovered
his
construction
was
found
to
be
correct
halleck
says
in
argument
or
reasoning
we
are
much
aided
by
the
habit
of
searching
for
hidden
resemblances
the
detection
of
such
a
relation
cultivates
thought
if
we
are
to
succeed
in
argument
we
must
develop
what
some
call
a
sixth
sense
of
such
relations
the
study
of
poetry
may
be
made
very
serviceable
in
detecting
analogies
and
cultivating
the
reasoning
powers
when
the
poet
brings
clearly
to
mind
the
change
due
to
death
using
as
an
illustration
the
caterpillar
body
transformed
into
the
butterfly
spirit
moving
with
winged
ease
over
flowering
meadows
he
is
cultivating
our
apprehension
of
relations
none
the
less
valuable
because
they
are
beautiful
but
the
student
must
be
on
guard
against
the
deceptive
conclusions
sometimes
arising
from
reasoning
by
analogy
as
jevons
says
in
many
cases
reasoning
by
analogy
is
found
to
be
a
very
uncertain
guide
in
some
cases
unfortunate
mistakes
are
made
children
are
sometimes
killed
by
gathering
and
eating
poisonous
berries
wrongly
inferring
that
they
can
be
eaten
because
other
berries
of
a
somewhat
similar
appearance
have
been
found
agreeable
and
harmless
poisonous
toadstools
are
occasionally
mistaken
for
mushrooms
especially
by
people
not
accustomed
to
gathering
them
in
norway
mushrooms
are
seldom
seen
and
are
not
eaten
but
when
i
once
found
a
few
there
and
had
them
cooked
at
an
inn
i
was
amused
by
the
people
of
the
inn
who
went
and
collected
toadstools
and
wanted
me
to
eat
them
also
this
was
clearly
a
case
of
mistaken
reasoning
by
analogy
even
brute
animals
reason
in
the
same
way
in
some
degree
the
beaten
dog
fears
every
stick
and
there
are
few
dogs
which
will
not
run
away
when
you
pretend
to
pick
up
a
stone
even
if
there
be
no
stone
to
pick
up
halleck
says
many
false
analogies
are
manufactured
and
it
is
excellent
thought
training
to
expose
them
the
majority
of
people
think
so
little
that
they
swallow
these
false
analogies
just
as
newly
fledged
robins
swallow
small
stones
dropped
into
their
open
mouths
this
tendency
to
think
as
others
do
must
be
resisted
somewhere
along
the
line
or
there
can
be
no
progress
brooks
says
the
argument
from
analogy
is
plausible
but
often
deceptive
thus
to
infer
that
since
american
swans
are
white
the
australian
swan
is
white
gives
a
false
conclusion
for
it
is
really
black
so
to
infer
that
because
john
smith
has
a
red
nose
and
is
a
drunkard
then
henry
jones
who
also
has
a
red
nose
is
also
a
drunkard
would
be
a
dangerous
inference
conclusions
of
this
kind
drawn
from
analogy
are
frequently
fallacious
regarding
the
for
reasoning
from
jevons
says
there
is
no
way
in
which
we
can
really
assure
ourselves
that
we
are
arguing
safely
by
analogy
the
only
rule
that
can
be
given
is
this
that
the
more
closely
two
things
resemble
each
other
the
more
likely
it
is
that
they
are
the
same
in
other
respects
especially
in
points
closely
connected
with
those
observed
in
order
to
be
clear
about
our
conclusions
we
ought
in
fact
never
to
rest
satisfied
with
mere
analogy
but
ought
to
try
to
discover
the
general
laws
governing
the
case
in
analogy
we
seem
to
reason
from
one
fact
to
another
fact
without
troubling
ourselves
either
with
deduction
or
induction
but
it
is
only
by
a
kind
of
guess
that
we
do
so
it
is
not
really
conclusive
reasoning
we
ought
properly
to
ascertain
what
general
laws
of
nature
are
shown
to
exist
by
the
facts
observed
and
then
infer
what
will
happen
according
to
these
laws
we
find
that
reasoning
by
analogy
is
not
to
be
depended
upon
unless
we
make
such
an
inquiry
into
the
causes
and
laws
of
the
things
in
question
that
we
really
employ
inductive
and
deductive
reasoning
along
the
same
lines
brooks
says
the
inference
from
analogy
like
that
from
induction
should
be
used
with
caution
its
conclusion
must
not
be
regarded
as
certain
but
merely
as
reaching
a
high
degree
of
probability
the
inference
from
a
part
to
a
part
no
more
than
from
a
part
to
the
whole
is
attended
with
any
rational
necessity
to
attain
certainty
we
must
show
that
the
principles
which
lie
at
the
root
of
the
process
are
either
necessary
laws
of
thought
or
necessary
laws
of
nature
both
of
which
are
impossible
hence
analogy
can
pretend
to
only
a
high
degree
of
probability
it
may
even
reach
a
large
degree
of
certainty
but
it
never
reaches
necessity
we
must
therefore
be
careful
not
to
accept
any
inference
from
analogy
as
true
until
it
is
proved
to
be
true
by
actual
observation
and
experiment
or
by
such
an
application
of
induction
as
to
remove
all
reasonable
doubt
chapter

fallacies
a
is
an
unsound
argument
or
mode
of
arguing
which
while
appearing
to
be
decisive
of
a
question
is
in
reality
not
so
an
argument
or
proposition
apparently
sound
but
really
fallacious
a
fallacious
statement
or
proposition
in
which
the
error
is
not
apparent
and
which
is
therefore
likely
to
mislead
or
deceive
sophistry
in
deductive
reasoning
we
meet
with
two
classes
of
fallacies
namely
fallacious
premise
and
fallacious
conclusion
we
shall
now
consider
each
of
these
in
turn
is
in
effect
unwarranted
assumption
of
one
of
the
most
common
forms
of
this
kind
of
fallacy
is
known
as
the
the
principle
of
which
is
the
assumption
of
a
fundamental
premise
which
is
not
conceded
the
unwarrantable
assumption
of
that
which
is
to
be
proved
or
the
assumption
of
that
by
which
it
is
to
be
proved
without
proving
it
its
most
common
form
is
that
of
boldly
stating
some
unproven
fact
authoritatively
and
positively
and
then
proceeding
to
use
the
statement
as
the
major
premise
of
the
argument
proceeding
logically
from
that
point
the
hearer
perceiving
the
argument
proceeding
logically
often
fails
to
remember
that
premise
has
been
merely
without
warrant
and
without
proof
and
omitting
the
hypothetical
one
may
proceed
to
argue
logically
from
the
premise
that
the
moon
is
made
of
green
cheese
but
the
whole
argument
is
invalid
and
fallacious
because
of
the
fact
that
the
person
making
it
has
begged
the
question
upon
an
unwarranted
premise
hyslop
gives
a
good
example
of
this
form
of
fallacy
in
the
case
of
the
proposition
church
and
state
should
be
united
proof
being
demanded
the
advocate
proceeds
to
beg
the
question
as
follows
good
institutions
should
be
united
church
and
state
are
good
institutions
therefore
church
and
state
should
be
united
the
proposition
that
good
institutions
should
be
united
is
fallacious
being
merely
assumed
and
not
proven
the
proposition
sounds
reasonable
and
few
will
feel
disposed
to
dispute
it
at
first
but
a
little
consideration
will
show
that
while
good
institutions
may
well
be
united
it
is
a
general
truth
that
should
be
so
begging
the
question
also
often
arises
from
a
name
to
a
and
then
assuming
that
we
have
the
thing
this
is
a
very
frequent
practice
with
many
people
they
try
to
by
merely
applying
names
an
example
of
this
kind
is
had
in
the
case
of
the
person
who
tried
to
explain
why
one
could
see
through
a
pane
of
glass
by
saying
because
it
is
transparent
or
when
one
explains
that
the
reason
a
certain
substance
breaks
easily
is
because
it
is
brittle
moliere
makes
the
father
of
a
dumb
girl
ask
why
his
daughter
is
dumb
the
physician
answers
nothing
is
more
easy
than
to
explain
it
it
comes
from
her
having
lost
the
power
of
speech
yes
yes
objects
the
father
but
the
cause
if
you
please
why
she
has
lost
the
power
of
speech
the
physician
gravely
replies
all
our
best
authors
will
tell
you
that
it
is
the
impeding
of
the
action
of
the
tongue
jevons
says
the
most
frequent
way
perhaps
in
which
we
commit
this
kind
of
fallacy
is
to
employ
names
which
imply
that
we
disapprove
of
something
and
then
argue
that
because
it
is
such
and
such
it
must
be
condemned
when
two
sportsmen
fall
out
in
some
manner
relating
to
the
subject
of
game
one
will
in
all
probability
argue
that
the
act
of
the
other
was
and
therefore
should
not
have
been
done
here
is
to
all
appearance
a
correct
syllogism
no
unsportsmanlike
act
should
be
done
john
robinson
act
was
unsportsmanlike
therefore
john
robinson
act
should
not
have
been
done
this
is
quite
correct
in
form
but
it
is
evidently
the
mere
semblance
of
an
argument
means
a
sportsman
should
not
the
point
to
be
argued
was
whether
the
act
fell
within
the
customary
definition
of
was
arising
from
begging
the
question
and
in
fact
a
class
of
the
latter
is
what
is
called
reasoning
in
a
circle
in
this
form
of
fallacy
one
assumes
as
proof
of
a
proposition
the
proposition
itself
or
uses
the
conclusion
to
prove
the
premise
for
instance
this
man
is
a
rascal
because
he
is
a
rogue
and
he
is
a
rogue
because
he
is
a
rascal
or
it
is
warm
because
it
is
summer
and
it
is
summer
because
it
is
warm
or
he
never
drinks
to
excess
because
he
is
never
intemperate
in
drinking
brooks
says
thus
to
argue
that
a
party
is
good
because
it
advocates
good
measures
and
that
certain
measures
are
good
because
they
are
advocated
by
so
excellent
a
party
is
to
reason
in
a
circle
so
when
persons
argue
that
their
church
is
the
true
one
because
it
was
established
by
god
and
then
argue
that
since
it
is
the
true
church
it
must
have
been
founded
by
god
they
fall
into
this
fallacy
to
argue
that
will
is
determined
by
the
strongest
motive
and
to
define
the
strongest
motive
as
which
influences
the
will
is
to
revolve
in
a
circle
of
thought
and
prove
nothing
plato
commits
this
error
when
he
argues
the
immortality
of
the
soul
from
its
simplicity
and
afterwards
attempts
to
prove
its
simplicity
from
its
immortality
it
needs
care
to
avoid
this
error
for
it
is
surprising
how
easily
one
falls
into
it
hyslop
says
the
fallacy
of
reasoning
in
a
circle
occurs
mostly
in
long
arguments
where
it
can
be
committed
without
ready
detection
when
it
occurs
in
a
long
discourse
it
may
be
committed
without
easy
discovery
it
is
likely
to
be
occasioned
by
the
use
of
synonyms
which
are
taken
to
express
more
than
the
conception
involved
when
they
do
not
what
is
called
a
vicious
circle
is
caused
when
the
conclusion
of
one
syllogism
is
used
for
a
proposition
in
another
syllogism
which
in
its
turn
comes
to
be
used
as
a
basis
for
the
first
or
is
in
effect
unwarranted
or
irrelevant
assumption
of
a
logical
there
are
many
forms
of
this
fallacy
among
which
are
the
following
which
consists
in
the
pretence
of
proving
one
thing
while
in
reality
merely
a
similar
or
related
thing
is
being
proved
in
this
class
is
the
argument
that
because
a
man
is
profane
he
must
necessarily
be
dishonest
or
that
because
a
man
denies
the
inspiration
of
the
scriptures
he
must
be
an
atheist
in
which
two
or
more
related
questions
are
asked
and
the
answer
of
one
is
then
applied
to
the
other
for
instance
you
assert
that
the
more
civilized
a
community
the
more
are
to
be
found
in
it
yes
then
you
state
that
are
the
promoters
and
cause
of
civilization
in
a
community
a
question
of
this
kind
is
often
so
arranged
that
an
answer
either
in
the
affirmative
or
the
negative
will
lead
to
a
false
or
fallacious
inference
for
instance
the
question
once
asked
a
respectable
citizen
on
the
witness
stand
have
you
stopped
beating
your
mother
an
answer
of
either
yes
or
no
was
out
of
the
question
for
it
would
have
placed
the
witness
in
a
false
position
for
he
had
never
beaten
his
mother
nor
been
accused
of
the
same
in
which
the
proof
of
a
partial
or
related
fact
is
used
to
infer
a
proof
of
the
whole
fact
or
a
related
one
for
instance
it
is
fallacious
to
argue
that
a
man
has
been
guilty
of
drunkenness
by
merely
proving
that
he
was
seen
entering
a
saloon
to
public
in
which
the
prejudices
of
the
public
are
appealed
to
rather
than
its
judgment
or
reason
in
politics
and
theological
argument
this
fallacy
is
frequent
it
is
no
argument
and
is
reprehensible
to
authority
or
in
which
the
reverence
and
respect
of
the
public
for
certain
persons
is
used
to
influence
their
feelings
in
place
of
their
judgment
or
reason
for
instance
washington
thought
and
therefore
it
must
be
right
or
it
is
foolish
to
affirm
that
aristotle
erred
or
it
has
been
believed
by
men
for
two
thousand
years
that
etc
or
what
our
fathers
believed
must
be
true
appeals
of
this
kind
may
have
their
proper
place
but
they
are
fallacies
nevertheless
and
not
real
argument
to
in
which
an
appeal
is
made
to
practices
principles
or
professions
of
the
opponent
rather
than
to
reason
or
judgment
thus
we
may
argue
that
a
certain
philosophy
or
religion
can
not
be
sound
or
good
because
certain
people
who
hold
it
are
not
consistent
or
not
worthy
moral
or
sober
this
argument
is
often
used
effectively
against
an
opponent
and
is
valid
against
him
personally
but
it
is
no
valid
argument
against
his
philosophy
or
belief
because
he
may
act
in
violation
of
them
or
he
may
change
his
practices
and
still
adhere
to
his
beliefs
the
two
are
not
joined
to
general
in
which
an
appeal
is
made
to
general
or
universal
belief
although
the
same
may
be
unsupported
by
proof
this
is
quite
common
but
is
no
real
argument
the
common
opinion
may
be
erroneous
as
history
proves
a
few
centuries
ago
this
argument
could
have
been
used
in
favor
of
the
earth
being
flat
etc
a
ago
it
was
used
against
darwin
today
it
is
being
used
against
other
new
ideas
it
is
a
fallacy
by
its
very
nature
to
in
which
an
appeal
is
made
to
the
ignorance
of
the
opponent
that
his
conviction
may
follow
from
his
inability
to
prove
the
contrary
it
is
virtually
no
argument
that
must
be
true
you
can
not
prove
that
it
is
as
brooks
says
to
argue
that
there
is
no
material
world
because
we
can
not
explain
how
the
mind
knows
it
to
exist
is
the
celebrated
fallacy
of
hume
in
philosophy
the
fact
that
we
can
not
find
a
needle
in
a
haystack
is
no
proof
that
it
is
not
there
of
new
also
called
in
which
matter
is
introduced
into
the
conclusion
that
is
not
in
the
premises
hyslop
gives
the
following
example
of
it
all
men
are
socrates
is
a
man
therefore
socrates
is
de
morgan
gives
the
following
more
complex
example
episcopacy
is
of
scripture
origin
the
church
of
england
is
the
only
episcopal
church
in
england
therefore
the
church
established
is
the
church
that
ought
to
be
supported
other
fallacies
resembling
in
some
respects
those
above
mentioned
are
as
follows
of
ambiguous
in
which
different
meanings
of
the
same
word
are
used
to
produce
the
fallacious
argument
as
jevons
says
a
word
with
two
distinct
meanings
really
two
between
collective
and
general
meanings
of
a
of
which
jevons
says
it
would
be
obviously
absurd
to
argue
that
because
the
books
in
the
british
museum
library
are
sure
to
give
information
about
king
alfred
therefore
any
particular
book
will
be
sure
to
give
it
by
the
books
in
the
british
museum
library
we
mean
all
there
are
many
other
cases
where
the
confusion
is
not
so
evident
and
where
great
numbers
of
people
are
unable
to
see
the
exact
difference
from
the
collective
to
the
in
which
the
fallacy
consists
of
arguing
that
because
something
is
true
of
the
whole
of
a
group
of
things
therefore
it
is
true
of
any
of
those
things
jevons
says
the
soldiers
in
a
regiment
may
be
able
to
capture
a
town
but
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
therefore
soldier
in
the
regiment
could
capture
the
town
single
handed
white
sheep
eat
a
great
deal
more
than
black
sheep
but
that
is
because
there
are
so
many
more
of
them
meaning
of
a
from
which
confusion
arises
and
fallacious
argument
may
spring
jevons
says
there
is
a
humorous
way
of
proving
that
a
cat
must
have
three
tails
because
a
cat
has
one
tail
more
than
cat
and
has
two
tails
therefore
cat
has
three
tails
here
the
fallacy
rests
upon
a
interpretation
of
no
the
wrong
in
which
the
attempt
to
confuse
conclusions
is
made
with
the
result
that
some
people
will
imagine
that
the
case
is
established
jevons
says
this
was
the
device
of
the
irishman
who
was
charged
with
theft
on
the
evidence
of
three
witnesses
who
had
seen
him
do
it
he
proposed
to
call
witnesses
who
had
seen
him
do
it
equally
logical
was
the
defense
of
the
man
who
was
called
a
materialist
and
who
replied
am
not
a
materialist
i
am
a
barber
of
unsuccessful
in
which
is
attempted
the
illogical
conclusion
that
a
certain
argument
has
failed
the
opposite
conclusion
is
this
fallacy
is
quite
common
especially
in
cases
of
juries
one
side
fails
to
prove
certain
contentions
and
the
jury
leaps
to
the
conclusion
that
the
opposite
contention
must
be
correct
this
is
clearly
fallacious
for
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
a
explanation
in
the
case
of
a
claim
of
juries
are
apt
to
fall
into
this
fallacy
the
failure
of
the
attempt
to
establish
an
is
often
held
to
be
in
the
nature
of
proof
of
the
guilt
of
the
accused
old
trial
lawyers
assert
that
a
failure
to
establish
a
claimed
tends
to
injure
the
chance
of
the
accused
more
than
direct
evidence
against
him
yet
as
all
logical
reasoners
will
see
there
is
no
logical
validity
in
any
such
inference
as
jevons
has
well
said
number
of
failures
in
attempting
to
prove
a
proposition
really
disprove
at
the
end
of
each
failure
the
case
simply
stands
in
the
same
position
as
before
the
attempt
not
proven
violations
of
the
rules
of
the
constitute
fallacies
as
may
be
seen
by
forming
a
syllogism
in
violation
of
one
or
more
of
the
rules
the
logicians
particularly
those
of
ancient
times
took
great
pains
to
discover
and
new
variations
of
fallacies
many
of
which
were
in
nature
and
not
worthy
of
being
considered
seriously
some
of
those
which
we
have
enumerated
may
possibly
be
open
to
the
same
criticism
but
we
have
omitted
many
of
the
worst
offenders
against
practical
common
sense
an
understanding
of
the
fundamental
laws
of
reasoning
is
sufficient
to
expose
and
unmask
all
fallacies
and
such
understanding
is
far
more
valuable
than
the
memorizing
of
the
of
fallacies
which
would
not
deceive
a
child
in
addition
to
the
above
stated
fallacies
of
deductive
reasoning
there
are
other
fallacies
which
are
met
with
in
let
us
briefly
consider
them
and
false
is
a
common
fallacy
of
this
class
persons
sometimes
see
certain
qualities
in
a
few
individuals
of
a
class
and
mistakenly
infer
that
the
individuals
in
that
class
must
possess
these
same
qualities
travelers
frequently
commit
this
fallacy
englishmen
visiting
the
united
states
for
a
few
weeks
have
been
known
to
publish
books
upon
their
return
home
making
the
most
ridiculous
generalizations
regarding
the
american
people
their
assertions
being
based
upon
the
observation
of
a
few
scattered
individuals
often
not
at
all
representative
americans
traveling
abroad
commit
similar
errors
a
flying
trip
through
a
country
does
not
afford
the
proper
opportunity
for
correct
generalization
as
brooks
says
no
hypothesis
should
be
accepted
as
true
until
the
facts
are
so
numerous
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
its
being
proved
of
result
from
incorrect
methods
of
observation
among
which
may
be
mentioned
the
following
or
inexact
perception
and
conception
in
which
one
observes
only
a
part
of
the
thing
or
fact
omitting
the
remainder
and
thus
forming
an
incomplete
and
imperfect
concept
of
the
thing
or
fact
of
exceptions
and
contradictory
in
which
the
exceptions
and
contradictory
facts
are
ignored
thereby
giving
undue
importance
to
the
observed
facts
of
which
are
not
real
facts
or
the
assumption
of
the
truth
of
things
which
are
untrue
of
inferences
with
which
is
most
unwarrantable
of
mistaken
result
from
the
assumption
of
a
thing
as
a
cause
when
it
is
not
so
of
which
the
following
are
familiar
examples
the
antecedent
for
the
which
consists
in
assuming
a
mere
antecedent
thing
for
a
of
another
thing
thus
one
might
assume
that
the
crowing
of
the
cock
was
the
of
daybreak
because
it
it
or
that
a
comet
was
the
cause
of
the
plague
which
followed
its
appearance
or
in
the
actual
case
in
which
a
child
reasoned
that
doctors
deaths
because
observation
had
shown
that
they
always
visited
persons
before
they
died
or
that
crops
failed
because
a
president
of
a
certain
political
party
had
been
inaugurated
a
few
months
before
some
fallacies
of
everyday
reasoning
are
quite
as
illogical
as
those
just
mentioned
the
symptom
for
the
which
consists
in
assuming
as
a
some
mere
symptom
sign
or
incident
of
the
real
cause
to
assume
that
the
pimples
of
measles
were
the
of
the
disease
would
be
to
commit
a
fallacy
of
this
kind
we
have
mentioned
elsewhere
the
fallacy
which
would
assume
to
be
the
cause
of
civilization
instead
of
being
a
mere
incident
of
the
latter
politicians
are
fond
of
assuming
certain
incidents
or
signs
of
a
period
as
being
the
of
the
prosperity
culture
and
advancement
of
the
period
or
the
reverse
one
might
argue
with
equal
force
that
automobiles
were
the
causes
of
national
prosperity
pointing
to
the
fact
that
the
more
automobiles
to
be
seen
the
better
the
times
or
that
straw
hats
produced
hot
weather
for
similar
reasons
fallacy
of
consists
in
assuming
a
resemblance
or
identity
where
none
exists
we
have
spoken
of
this
in
another
chapter
brooks
says
also
it
is
a
fallacy
to
carry
an
analogy
too
far
as
to
infer
from
the
parable
of
the
praying
of
the
importunate
woman
that
god
resembles
the
unjust
judge
in
conclusion
we
would
call
your
attention
to
the
following
words
from
jevons
in
which
he
expresses
the
gist
of
the
matter
it
is
impossible
too
often
to
remind
people
that
on
the
one
hand
correct
reasoning
consists
in
substituting
like
things
for
like
and
inferring
that
what
is
true
of
one
will
be
true
of
all
which
are
similar
to
it
in
the
points
