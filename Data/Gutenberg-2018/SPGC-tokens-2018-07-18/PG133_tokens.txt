the
damnation
of
theron
ware
by
harold
frederic
part
i
chapter
i
no
such
throng
had
ever
before
been
seen
in
the
building
during
all
its
eight
years
of
existence
people
were
wedged
together
most
uncomfortably
upon
the
seats
they
stood
packed
in
the
aisles
and
overflowed
the
galleries
at
the
back
in
the
shadows
underneath
these
galleries
they
formed
broad
dense
masses
about
the
doors
through
which
it
would
be
hopeless
to
attempt
a
passage
the
light
given
out
from
numerous
circles
of
flaring
arranged
on
the
ceiling
fell
full
upon
a
thousand
uplifted
faces
some
framed
in
bonnets
or
juvenile
curls
others
bearded
or
crowned
with
shining
baldness
but
all
alike
under
the
spell
of
a
dominant
emotion
which
held
features
in
abstracted
suspense
and
focussed
every
eye
upon
a
common
objective
point
the
excitement
of
expectancy
reigned
upon
each
row
of
countenances
was
visible
in
every
attitude
nay
seemed
a
part
of
the
close
overheated
atmosphere
itself
an
observer
looking
over
these
compact
lines
of
faces
and
noting
the
uniform
concentration
of
eagerness
they
exhibited
might
have
guessed
that
they
were
watching
for
either
the
jury
verdict
in
some
peculiarly
absorbing
criminal
trial
or
the
announcement
of
the
lucky
numbers
in
a
great
lottery
these
two
expressions
seemed
to
alternate
and
even
to
mingle
vaguely
upon
the
upturned
lineaments
of
the
waiting
throng
the
hope
of
some
unnamed
stroke
of
fortune
and
the
dread
of
some
adverse
decree
but
a
glance
forward
at
the
object
of
this
universal
gaze
would
have
sufficed
to
shatter
both
hypotheses
here
was
neither
a
court
of
justice
nor
a
tombola
it
was
instead
the
closing
session
of
the
annual
nedahma
conference
of
the
methodist
episcopal
church
and
the
bishop
was
about
to
read
out
the
list
of
ministerial
appointments
for
the
coming
year
this
list
was
evidently
written
in
a
hand
strange
to
him
and
the
slow
old
gentleman
having
at
last
sufficiently
rubbed
the
glasses
of
his
spectacles
and
then
adjusted
them
over
his
nose
with
annoying
deliberation
was
now
silently
rehearsing
his
task
to
himself
the
while
the
clergymen
round
about
ground
their
teeth
and
restlessly
shuffled
their
feet
in
impatience
upon
a
closer
inspection
of
the
assemblage
there
were
a
great
many
of
these
clergymen
a
dozen
or
more
dignified
and
for
the
most
part
elderly
brethren
sat
grouped
about
the
bishop
in
the
pulpit
as
many
others
not
quite
so
staid
in
mien
and
indeed
with
here
and
there
almost
a
suggestion
of
frivolity
in
their
postures
were
seated
on
the
steps
leading
down
from
this
platform
a
score
of
their
fellows
sat
facing
the
audience
on
chairs
tightly
wedged
into
the
space
railed
off
round
the
pulpit
and
then
came
five
or
six
rows
of
pews
stretching
across
the
whole
breadth
of
the
church
and
almost
solidly
filled
with
preachers
of
the
word
there
were
very
old
men
among
these
bent
and
decrepit
veterans
who
had
known
lorenzo
dow
and
had
been
ordained
by
elders
who
remembered
francis
asbury
and
even
whitefield
they
sat
now
in
front
places
leaning
forward
with
trembling
and
misshapen
hands
behind
their
hairy
ears
waiting
to
hear
their
names
read
out
on
the
superannuated
list
it
might
be
for
the
last
time
the
sight
of
these
venerable
fathers
in
israel
was
good
to
the
eyes
conjuring
up
as
it
did
pictures
of
a
time
when
a
plain
and
homely
people
had
been
served
by
a
fervent
and
devoted
clergy
by
preachers
who
lacked
in
learning
and
polish
no
doubt
but
who
gave
their
lives
without
dream
of
earthly
reward
to
poverty
and
to
the
danger
and
wearing
toil
of
itinerant
missions
through
the
rude
frontier
settlements
these
pictures
had
for
their
primitive
accessories
rough
household
implements
coarse
clothes
and
patched
old
saddles
which
told
of
weary
years
of
journeying
but
to
even
the
least
sympathetic
vision
there
shone
upon
them
the
glorified
light
of
the
cross
and
crown
reverend
survivors
of
the
heroic
times
their
very
presence
there
sitting
meekly
at
the
to
hear
again
the
published
record
of
their
uselessness
and
of
their
dependence
upon
church
charity
was
in
the
nature
of
a
benediction
the
large
majority
of
those
surrounding
these
patriarchs
were
men
generally
of
a
robust
type
with
burly
shoulders
and
bushing
beards
framing
shaven
upper
lips
and
who
looked
for
the
most
part
like
honest
and
prosperous
farmers
attired
in
their
sunday
clothes
as
exceptions
to
this
rule
there
were
scattered
stray
specimens
of
a
more
urban
class
worthies
with
neatly
trimmed
whiskers
white
neckcloths
and
even
indications
of
all
eloquent
of
citified
charges
and
now
and
again
the
eye
singled
out
a
striking
and
scholarly
face
at
once
strong
and
simple
and
instinctively
referred
it
to
the
faculty
of
one
of
the
several
theological
seminaries
belonging
to
the
conference
the
effect
of
these
faces
as
a
whole
was
toward
goodness
candor
and
imperturbable
rather
than
learning
or
mental
astuteness
and
curiously
enough
it
wore
its
pleasantest
aspect
on
the
countenances
of
the
older
men
the
impress
of
zeal
and
moral
worth
seemed
to
diminish
by
regular
gradations
as
one
passed
to
younger
faces
and
among
the
very
beginners
who
had
been
ordained
only
within
the
past
day
or
two
this
decline
was
peculiarly
marked
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
note
the
relative
smallness
of
their
number
so
plainly
was
it
to
be
seen
that
they
were
not
the
men
their
forbears
had
been
and
if
those
aged
preachers
facing
the
pulpit
had
gazed
instead
backward
over
the
congregation
it
may
be
that
here
too
their
old
eyes
would
have
detected
a
difference
what
at
least
they
would
have
deemed
a
decline
but
nothing
was
further
from
the
minds
of
the
members
of
the
first
church
of
tecumseh
than
the
suggestion
that
they
were
not
an
improvement
on
those
who
had
gone
before
them
they
were
undoubtedly
the
smartest
and
most
important
congregation
within
the
limits
of
the
nedahma
conference
and
this
new
church
edifice
of
theirs
represented
alike
a
scale
of
outlay
and
a
standard
of
progressive
taste
in
devotional
architecture
unique
in
the
methodism
of
that
whole
section
of
the
state
they
had
a
right
to
be
proud
of
themselves
too
they
belonged
to
the
substantial
order
of
the
community
with
perhaps
not
so
many
very
rich
men
as
the
presbyterians
had
but
on
the
other
hand
with
far
fewer
extremely
poor
folk
than
the
baptists
were
encumbered
with
the
pews
in
the
first
four
rows
of
their
church
rented
for
one
hundred
dollars
apiece
quite
up
to
the
presbyterian
highwater
mark
and
they
now
had
almost
abolished
free
pews
altogether
the
oyster
suppers
given
by
their
ladies
aid
society
in
the
basement
of
the
church
during
the
winter
had
established
rank
among
the
fashionable
events
in
tecumseh
social
calendar
a
comprehensive
and
satisfied
perception
of
these
advantages
was
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
this
local
audience
as
they
waited
for
the
bishop
to
begin
his
reading
they
had
entertained
this
bishop
and
his
presiding
elders
and
the
rank
and
file
of
common
preachers
in
a
style
which
could
not
have
been
remotely
approached
by
any
other
congregation
in
the
conference
where
else
one
would
like
to
know
could
the
bishop
have
been
domiciled
in
a
methodist
house
where
he
might
have
a
all
to
himself
with
his
bedroom
leading
out
of
it
every
clergyman
present
had
been
provided
for
in
a
private
residence
even
down
to
the
licensed
exhorters
who
were
not
really
ministers
at
all
when
you
came
to
think
of
it
and
who
might
well
thank
their
stars
that
the
conference
had
assembled
among
such
people
there
existed
a
dim
feeling
that
these
licensed
exhorters
an
uncouth
crew
with
country
and
lumbermen
and
even
a
among
their
number
had
taken
rather
too
much
for
granted
and
were
not
exhibiting
quite
the
proper
degree
of
gratitude
over
their
reception
but
a
more
important
issue
hung
now
imminent
in
the
balance
was
tecumseh
to
be
fairly
and
honorably
rewarded
for
her
hospitality
by
being
given
the
pastor
of
her
choice
all
were
agreed
at
least
among
those
who
paid
upon
the
great
importance
of
a
change
in
the
pulpit
of
the
first
church
a
change
in
persons
must
of
course
take
place
for
their
present
pastor
had
exhausted
the
maximum
of
the
itinerant
system
but
there
was
needed
much
more
than
that
for
a
handsome
and
expensive
church
building
like
this
and
with
such
a
modern
and
congregation
it
was
simply
a
vital
necessity
to
secure
an
attractive
and
fashionable
preacher
they
had
held
their
own
against
the
presbyterians
these
past
few
years
only
by
the
most
strenuous
efforts
and
under
the
depressing
disadvantage
of
a
minister
who
preached
dreary
sermons
and
who
lacked
even
the
most
rudimentary
sense
of
social
distinctions
the
presbyterians
had
captured
the
new
cashier
of
the
adams
county
bank
who
had
always
gone
to
the
methodist
church
in
the
town
he
came
from
but
now
was
lost
solely
because
of
this
tiresome
old
fossil
of
theirs
and
there
were
numerous
other
instances
of
the
same
sort
scarcely
less
grievous
that
this
state
of
things
must
be
altered
was
clear
the
unusually
large
local
attendance
upon
the
sessions
of
the
conference
had
given
some
of
the
more
guileless
of
visiting
brethren
a
high
notion
of
tecumseh
piety
and
perhaps
even
the
most
sophisticated
stranger
never
quite
realized
how
strictly
it
was
to
be
explained
by
the
anxiety
to
pick
out
a
suitable
champion
for
the
fierce
presbyterian
competition
big
gatherings
assembled
evening
after
evening
to
hear
the
sermons
of
those
selected
to
preach
and
the
church
had
been
almost
impossibly
crowded
at
each
of
the
three
sunday
services
opinions
had
naturally
differed
a
good
deal
during
the
earlier
stages
of
this
scrutiny
but
after
last
night
sermon
there
could
be
but
one
feeling
the
man
for
tecumseh
was
the
reverend
theron
ware
the
choice
was
an
admirable
one
from
points
of
view
much
more
exalted
than
those
of
the
local
congregation
you
could
see
ware
sitting
there
at
the
end
of
the
row
inside
the
the
tall
slender
young
man
with
the
broad
white
brow
thoughtful
eyes
and
features
moulded
into
that
regularity
of
strength
which
used
to
characterize
the
american
senatorial
type
in
those
days
of
faces
and
moderate
incomes
before
the
war
the
comely
and
vivacious
young
woman
in
the
second
side
pew
was
his
wife
and
tecumseh
noted
with
approbation
that
she
knew
how
to
dress
there
were
really
no
two
better
or
worthier
people
in
the
building
than
this
young
couple
who
sat
waiting
along
with
the
rest
to
hear
their
fate
but
unhappily
they
had
come
to
know
of
the
effort
being
made
to
bring
them
to
tecumseh
and
their
simple
pride
in
the
triumph
of
the
husband
fine
sermon
had
become
swallowed
up
in
a
terribly
anxious
conflict
of
hope
and
fear
neither
of
them
could
maintain
a
satisfactory
show
of
composure
as
the
decisive
moment
approached
the
vision
of
translation
from
poverty
and
obscurity
to
such
a
splendid
post
as
this
truly
it
was
too
dazzling
for
tranquil
nerves
the
tedious
bishop
had
at
last
begun
to
call
his
roll
of
names
and
the
good
people
of
tecumseh
mentally
ticked
them
off
one
by
one
as
the
list
expanded
they
felt
that
it
was
like
this
bishop
an
unimportant
and
commonplace
figure
in
methodism
not
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
with
simpson
and
janes
and
kingsley
that
he
should
begin
with
the
backwoods
counties
and
thrust
all
these
remote
and
pitifully
rustic
stations
ahead
of
their
own
metropolitan
charge
to
these
they
listened
but
listlessly
indifferent
alike
to
the
joy
and
to
the
dismay
which
he
was
scattering
among
the
divines
before
him
the
announcements
were
being
doled
out
with
stumbling
hesitation
after
each
one
a
little
movement
through
the
crowded
rows
of
clergymen
passed
mute
judgment
upon
the
cruel
blow
this
brother
had
received
the
reward
justly
given
to
this
other
the
favoritism
by
which
a
third
had
profited
the
presiding
elders
whose
work
all
this
was
stared
with
gloomy
and
impersonal
abstraction
down
upon
the
rows
of
blackcoated
humanity
spread
before
them
the
ministers
returned
this
fixed
and
perfunctory
gaze
with
pale
set
faces
only
feebly
masking
the
emotions
which
each
new
name
stirred
somewhere
among
them
the
bishop
droned
on
laboriously
mispronouncing
words
and
repeating
himself
as
if
he
were
reading
a
catalogue
of
unfamiliar
seeds
first
church
of
tecumseh
brother
abram
tisdale
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
these
were
actually
the
words
that
had
been
uttered
after
all
this
outlay
all
this
lavish
hospitality
all
this
sacrifice
of
time
and
patience
in
sitting
through
those
sermons
to
draw
from
the
nothing
better
than
a
tisdale
a
hum
of
outraged
astonishment
half
groan
half
wrathful
snort
bounded
along
from
pew
to
pew
throughout
the
body
of
the
church
an
echo
of
it
reached
the
bishop
and
so
confused
him
that
he
haltingly
repeated
the
obnoxious
line
every
local
eye
turned
as
by
intuition
to
where
the
calamitous
tisdale
sat
and
fastened
malignantly
upon
him
could
anything
be
worse
this
brother
tisdale
was
past
fifty
a
spindling
rickety
gaunt
old
man
with
a
long
head
and
vacantly
solemn
face
who
kept
one
or
the
other
of
his
hands
continually
fumbling
his
bony
jaw
he
had
been
withdrawn
from
routine
service
for
a
number
of
years
doing
a
little
insurance
canvassing
on
his
own
account
and
also
travelling
for
the
book
concern
now
that
he
wished
to
return
to
parochial
work
the
richest
prize
in
the
whole
list
tecumseh
was
given
to
him
to
him
who
had
never
been
asked
to
preach
at
a
conference
and
whose
archaic
nasal
singing
of
greenland
icy
mountains
had
made
even
the
licensed
exhorters
grin
it
was
too
intolerably
dreadful
to
think
of
an
embittered
whisper
to
the
effect
that
tisdale
was
the
bishop
cousin
ran
round
from
pew
to
pew
this
did
not
happen
to
be
true
but
indignant
tecumseh
gave
it
entire
credit
the
throngs
about
the
doors
dwindled
as
by
magic
and
the
aisles
cleared
local
interest
was
dead
and
even
some
of
the
pewholders
rose
and
made
their
way
out
one
of
these
murmured
audibly
to
his
neighbors
as
he
departed
that
his
pew
could
be
had
now
for
sixty
dollars
so
it
happened
that
when
a
little
later
on
the
appointment
of
theron
ware
to
octavius
was
read
out
none
of
the
people
of
tecumseh
either
noted
or
cared
they
had
been
deeply
interested
in
him
so
long
as
it
seemed
likely
that
he
was
to
come
to
them
before
their
clearly
expressed
desire
for
him
had
been
so
monstrously
ignored
but
now
what
became
of
him
was
no
earthly
concern
of
theirs
after
the
doxology
had
been
sung
and
the
conference
formally
declared
ended
the
wares
would
fain
have
escaped
from
the
flood
of
handshakings
and
boisterous
farewells
which
spread
over
the
front
part
of
the
church
but
the
clergymen
were
unusually
insistent
upon
demonstrations
of
cordiality
among
themselves
the
more
perhaps
because
it
was
evident
that
the
friendliness
of
their
local
hosts
had
suddenly
evaporated
and
of
all
men
in
the
world
the
present
incumbent
of
the
octavius
pulpit
now
bore
down
upon
them
with
noisy
effusiveness
and
defied
evasion
brother
ware
we
have
never
been
interduced
but
let
me
clasp
your
hand
and
sister
ware
i
presume
yours
too
he
was
a
portly
man
who
held
his
head
back
so
that
his
face
seemed
all
jowl
and
mouth
and
sandy
he
smiled
broadly
upon
them
with
eyes
and
shook
hands
again
i
said
to
he
went
on
with
loud
pretence
of
heartiness
the
minute
i
heerd
your
name
called
out
for
our
dear
octavius
must
go
over
an
interduce
myself
it
will
be
a
heavy
cross
to
part
with
those
dear
people
brother
ware
but
if
anything
could
wean
me
to
the
notion
so
to
speak
it
would
be
the
knowledge
that
you
are
to
take
up
my
labors
in
their
midst
perhaps
ah
perhaps
they
are
jest
a
trifle
close
in
money
matters
but
they
come
out
strong
on
revivals
they
need
a
good
deal
o
stirrin
up
about
parsonage
expenses
but
oh
such
seasons
of
grace
as
we
experienced
there
together
he
shook
his
head
and
closed
his
eyes
altogether
as
if
transported
by
his
memories
brother
ware
smiled
faintly
in
decorous
response
and
bowed
in
silence
but
his
wife
resented
the
unctuous
beaming
of
content
on
the
wide
countenance
and
could
not
restrain
her
tongue
you
seem
to
bear
up
tolerably
well
under
this
heavy
cross
as
you
call
it
she
said
sharply
the
will
o
the
lord
sister
ware
the
will
o
the
lord
he
responded
disposed
for
the
instant
to
put
on
his
pompous
manner
with
her
and
then
deciding
to
smile
again
as
he
moved
off
the
circumstance
that
he
was
to
get
an
additional
three
hundred
dollars
yearly
in
his
new
place
was
not
mentioned
between
them
by
a
mutual
impulse
the
young
couple
when
they
had
at
last
gained
the
cool
open
air
crossed
the
street
to
the
side
where
trees
shaded
the
infrequent
lamps
and
they
might
be
comparatively
alone
the
wife
had
taken
her
husband
arm
and
pressed
closely
upon
it
as
they
walked
for
a
time
no
word
passed
but
finally
he
said
in
a
grave
voice
it
is
hard
upon
you
poor
then
she
stopped
short
buried
her
face
against
his
shoulder
and
fell
to
sobbing
he
strove
with
gentle
whispered
remonstrance
to
win
her
from
this
mood
and
after
a
few
moments
she
lifted
her
head
and
they
resumed
their
walk
she
wiping
her
eyes
as
they
went
i
could
keep
it
in
a
minute
longer
she
said
catching
her
breath
between
phrases
oh
why
do
they
behave
so
badly
to
us
theron
he
smiled
down
momentarily
upon
her
as
they
moved
along
and
patted
her
hand
somebody
must
have
the
poor
places
alice
he
said
consolingly
i
am
a
young
man
yet
remember
we
must
take
our
turn
and
be
patient
for
know
that
all
things
work
together
for
good
and
your
sermon
was
so
above
all
the
others
she
went
on
breathlessly
everybody
said
so
and
parshall
heard
it
so
direct
that
you
were
to
be
sent
here
and
i
know
she
told
everybody
how
much
i
was
lotting
on
it
i
wish
we
could
go
right
off
tonight
without
going
to
her
house
i
shall
be
ashamed
to
look
her
in
the
face
and
of
course
she
knows
we
poked
off
to
that
miserable
why
theron
they
tell
me
it
a
worse
place
even
than
we
got
now
oh
not
at
all
he
put
in
reassuringly
it
has
grown
to
be
a
large
town
oh
quite
twice
the
size
of
tyre
it
a
great
irish
place
heard
our
own
church
seems
to
be
a
good
deal
run
down
there
we
must
build
it
up
again
and
the
salary
is
better
a
but
he
too
was
depressed
and
they
walked
on
toward
their
temporary
lodging
in
a
silence
full
of
mutual
grief
it
was
not
until
they
had
come
within
sight
of
this
goal
that
he
prefaced
by
a
little
sigh
of
resignation
these
further
words
come
let
us
make
the
best
of
it
my
girl
after
all
we
are
in
the
hands
of
the
oh
do
theron
she
said
hastily
do
talk
to
me
about
the
lord
tonight
i
ca
bear
it
chapter
ii
theron
come
out
here
this
is
the
funniest
thing
we
have
heard
yet
ware
stood
on
the
platform
of
her
new
kitchen
stoop
the
bright
flood
of
sunshine
completely
enveloped
her
girlish
form
clad
in
a
simple
calico
gown
and
shone
in
golden
patches
upon
her
hair
she
had
a
smile
on
her
face
as
she
looked
down
at
the
milk
boy
standing
on
the
bottom
step
a
smile
of
a
doubtful
sort
stormily
mirthful
come
out
a
minute
theron
she
called
again
and
in
obedience
to
the
summons
the
tall
lank
figure
of
her
husband
appeared
in
the
open
doorway
behind
her
a
long
loose
open
dangled
to
his
knees
and
his
sallow
thoughtful
face
wore
a
morning
undress
expression
of
youthful
he
leaned
against
the
crossed
his
large
carpet
slippers
and
looked
up
into
the
sky
drawing
a
long
satisfied
breath
what
a
beautiful
morning
he
exclaimed
the
elms
over
there
are
full
of
robins
we
must
get
up
earlier
these
mornings
and
take
some
his
wife
indicated
the
boy
with
the
on
his
arm
by
a
wave
of
her
hand
guess
what
he
tells
me
she
said
it
was
a
mistake
at
all
our
getting
no
milk
yesterday
or
the
sunday
before
it
seems
that
that
the
custom
here
at
least
so
far
as
the
parsonage
is
what
the
matter
boy
asked
the
young
minister
drawling
his
words
a
little
and
putting
a
sense
of
placid
irony
into
them
do
the
cows
give
milk
on
sunday
then
the
boy
was
not
going
to
be
chaffed
oh
i
bring
you
milk
fast
enough
on
sundays
if
you
give
me
the
word
he
said
with
nonchalance
only
it
wo
last
how
do
you
mean
last
long
asked
ware
briskly
the
boy
liked
her
both
for
herself
and
for
the
doughnuts
fried
with
her
own
hands
which
she
gave
him
on
his
morning
round
he
dropped
his
tone
the
thing
of
it
this
he
explained
every
new
minister
starts
in
saying
we
can
deliver
to
this
house
on
sundays
an
then
gives
us
notice
to
stop
before
the
month
out
it
the
trustees
that
does
the
rev
theron
ware
uncrossed
his
feet
and
moved
out
on
to
the
stoop
beside
his
wife
what
that
you
say
he
interjected
do
they
take
milk
on
sundays
nope
answered
the
boy
the
young
couple
looked
each
other
in
the
face
for
a
puzzled
moment
then
broke
into
a
laugh
well
we
try
it
anyway
said
the
preacher
you
can
go
on
bringing
it
sundays
till
till
till
you
cave
in
an
tell
me
to
stop
put
in
the
boy
all
right
and
he
was
off
on
the
instant
the
dipper
jangling
loud
incredulity
in
his
pail
as
he
went
the
wares
exchanged
another
glance
as
he
disappeared
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
another
mutual
laugh
seemed
imminent
then
the
face
clouded
over
and
she
thrust
her
a
trifle
forward
out
of
its
place
in
the
straight
and
gently
firm
profile
it
just
what
wendell
phillips
said
she
declared
idea
of
hell
is
a
place
where
everybody
has
to
mind
his
own
business
the
young
minister
stroked
his
chin
thoughtfully
and
let
his
gaze
wander
over
the
backyard
in
silence
the
garden
parts
had
not
been
spaded
up
but
lay
a
useless
stretch
of
muddy
earth
broken
only
by
last
year
and
the
general
litter
of
dead
roots
and
vegetation
the
door
of
the
tenantless
hung
wide
open
before
it
was
a
great
heap
of
ashes
and
cinders
soaked
into
grimy
hardness
by
the
recent
spring
rains
and
nearer
still
an
ancient
round
which
were
scattered
old
hardwood
knots
which
had
defied
the
axe
parts
of
broken
barrels
and
and
a
nameless
debris
of
tin
cans
and
general
rubbish
it
was
pleasanter
to
lift
the
eyes
and
look
across
the
neighbors
fences
to
the
green
waving
tops
of
the
elms
on
the
street
beyond
how
lofty
and
beautiful
they
were
in
the
morning
sunlight
and
with
what
matchless
charm
came
the
song
of
the
robins
freshly
installed
in
their
haunts
among
the
new
leaves
above
them
in
the
fresh
scented
air
glowed
the
great
blue
dome
radiant
with
light
and
the
purification
of
spring
theron
lifted
his
thin
hand
and
passed
it
in
a
slow
arch
of
movement
to
comprehend
this
glorious
upper
picture
what
matter
anyone
ideas
of
hell
he
said
in
soft
grave
tones
when
we
have
that
to
look
at
and
listen
to
and
fill
our
lungs
with
it
seems
to
me
that
we
never
feel
quite
so
sure
of
god
goodness
at
other
times
as
we
do
in
these
wonderful
new
mornings
of
the
wife
followed
his
gesture
and
her
eyes
rested
for
a
brief
moment
with
pleased
interest
upon
the
trees
and
the
sky
then
they
reverted
with
a
harsher
scrutiny
to
the
immediate
foreground
those
van
sizers
ought
to
be
downright
ashamed
of
themselves
she
said
to
leave
everything
in
such
a
muss
as
this
you
must
see
about
getting
a
man
to
clean
up
the
yard
theron
it
no
use
your
thinking
of
doing
it
yourself
in
the
first
place
it
would
look
quite
the
thing
and
second
you
never
get
at
it
in
all
your
born
days
or
if
a
man
would
cost
too
much
we
might
get
a
boy
i
daresay
harvey
would
come
around
after
he
finished
with
his
in
the
forenoon
we
could
give
him
his
dinner
you
know
and
i
bake
him
some
cookies
got
the
greatest
you
ever
heard
of
and
then
perhaps
if
we
gave
him
a
quarter
or
say
half
a
dollar
he
be
quite
satisfied
speak
to
him
in
the
morning
we
can
save
a
dollar
or
so
that
i
suppose
every
little
does
help
commented
ware
with
a
doleful
lack
of
conviction
then
his
face
brightened
i
tell
you
what
do
he
exclaimed
get
on
your
street
dress
and
we
take
a
long
walk
way
out
into
the
country
you
never
seen
the
basin
where
they
float
the
in
or
the
big
sawmills
the
hills
beyond
give
you
almost
mountain
effects
they
are
so
steep
and
they
say
there
a
sulphur
spring
among
the
slate
on
the
somewhere
with
trees
all
about
it
and
we
could
take
some
sandwiches
with
us
you
forget
put
in
ware
those
trustees
are
coming
at
so
they
are
assented
the
young
minister
with
something
like
a
sigh
he
cast
another
reluctant
lingering
glance
at
the
sunlit
elm
boughs
and
turning
went
indoors
he
loitered
for
an
aimless
minute
in
the
kitchen
where
his
wife
her
sleeves
rolled
to
the
elbow
now
resumed
the
interrupted
washing
of
the
breakfast
dishes
perhaps
with
vague
visions
of
that
time
to
come
when
they
might
have
a
hired
girl
to
do
such
work
then
he
wandered
off
into
the
room
beyond
which
served
them
alike
as
and
study
and
let
his
eye
run
along
the
two
rows
of
books
that
constituted
his
library
he
saw
nothing
which
he
wanted
to
read
finally
he
did
take
down
paley
evidences
and
seated
himself
in
the
big
armchair
that
costly
and
oversized
anomaly
among
his
humble
gods
but
the
book
lay
unopened
on
his
knee
and
his
eyelids
half
closed
themselves
in
sign
of
revery
this
was
his
third
charge
this
octavius
which
they
both
knew
they
were
going
to
dislike
so
much
the
first
had
been
in
the
pleasant
dairy
and
hop
country
many
miles
to
the
south
on
another
watershed
and
among
a
different
kind
of
people
perhaps
in
truth
the
grinding
labor
the
poverty
of
ideas
the
systematic
selfishness
of
later
rural
experience
had
not
been
lacking
there
but
they
played
no
part
in
the
memories
which
now
he
passed
in
tender
review
he
recalled
instead
the
warm
sunshine
on
the
fertile
expanse
of
fields
the
sleek
herds
of
milkers
coming
lowing
down
the
road
under
the
maples
the
prosperous
and
hospitable
farmhouses
with
their
orchards
in
blossom
and
their
spacious
red
barns
the
bountiful
boiled
dinners
which
cheery
housewives
served
up
with
their
own
skilled
hands
of
course
he
admitted
to
himself
it
would
not
be
the
same
if
he
were
to
go
back
there
again
he
was
conscious
of
having
moved
along
was
it
after
all
an
advance
to
a
point
where
it
was
unpleasant
to
sit
at
table
with
the
unfragrant
hired
man
and
still
worse
to
encounter
the
bucolic
confusion
between
the
functions
of
knives
and
forks
but
in
those
happy
days
young
zealous
himself
these
trifles
had
been
invisible
to
him
and
life
there
among
those
kindly
husbandmen
had
seemed
by
contrast
with
the
gaunt
surroundings
and
gloomy
rule
of
the
theological
seminary
luxuriously
abundant
and
free
it
was
there
too
that
the
crowning
blessedness
of
his
youth
nay
should
he
not
say
of
all
his
days
had
come
to
him
there
he
had
first
seen
alice
hastings
the
serenely
girl
who
now
less
than
four
years
thereafter
could
be
heard
washing
the
dishes
out
in
the
parsonage
kitchen
how
wonderful
she
had
seemed
to
him
then
how
beautiful
and
the
miracle
still
appeared
though
herself
the
daughter
of
a
farmer
her
presence
on
a
visit
within
the
borders
of
his
remote
country
charge
had
seemed
to
make
everything
there
a
hundred
times
more
countrified
than
it
had
ever
been
before
she
was
fresh
from
the
refinements
of
a
town
seminary
she
read
books
it
was
known
that
she
could
play
upon
the
piano
her
clothes
her
manners
her
way
of
speaking
the
readiness
of
her
thoughts
and
sprightly
tongue
not
least
perhaps
the
imposing
current
understanding
as
to
her
wealth
placed
her
on
a
glorified
pinnacle
far
away
from
the
girls
of
the
neighborhood
these
honest
and
creatures
indeed
called
ceaseless
attention
to
her
superiority
by
their
deference
and
admiration
and
treated
it
as
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
their
young
minister
should
be
visibly
taken
with
her
theron
ware
in
truth
left
this
first
pastorate
of
his
the
following
spring
in
a
transfiguring
halo
of
romance
his
new
appointment
was
to
tyre
a
somewhat
distant
village
of
traditional
local
pride
and
substance
and
he
was
to
be
married
only
a
day
or
so
before
entering
upon
his
pastoral
duties
there
the
good
people
among
whom
he
had
begun
his
ministry
took
kindly
credit
to
themselves
that
he
had
met
his
bride
while
she
was
visiting
round
their
countryside
in
part
by
jocose
inquiries
addressed
to
the
expectant
groom
in
part
by
the
confidences
of
the
postmaster
at
the
corners
concerning
the
bulk
and
frequency
of
the
correspondence
passing
between
theron
and
the
now
remote
alice
they
had
followed
the
progress
of
the
courtship
through
the
autumn
and
winter
with
friendly
zest
when
he
returned
from
the
conference
to
say
and
confess
the
happiness
that
awaited
him
they
gave
him
a
donation
quite
as
if
he
were
a
married
pastor
with
a
home
of
his
own
instead
of
a
shy
young
bachelor
who
received
his
guests
and
their
contributions
in
the
house
where
he
boarded
he
went
away
with
tears
of
mingled
regret
and
proud
joy
in
his
eyes
thinking
a
good
deal
upon
their
predictions
of
a
distinguished
career
before
him
feeling
infinitely
strengthened
and
upborne
by
the
hearty
fervor
of
their
and
taking
with
him
nearly
two
of
vegetables
apples
canned
preserves
assorted
furniture
glass
dishes
cheeses
pieced
bedquilts
honey
feathers
and
kitchen
utensils
of
the
three
years
term
in
tyre
it
was
pleasantest
to
dwell
upon
the
beginning
the
young
couple
after
being
married
out
at
alice
home
in
an
adjoining
county
under
the
depressing
conditions
of
a
hopelessly
bedridden
mother
and
a
father
and
brothers
whose
perceptions
were
obviously
closed
to
the
advantages
of
a
matrimonial
connection
with
methodism
came
straight
to
the
house
which
their
new
congregation
rented
as
a
parsonage
the
impulse
of
reaction
from
the
rather
grim
cheerlessness
of
their
wedding
lent
fresh
gayety
to
their
lighthearted
whimsical
start
at
housekeeping
they
had
never
laughed
so
much
in
all
their
lives
as
they
did
now
in
these
first
months
over
their
weird
ignorance
of
domestic
details
with
its
mishaps
mistakes
and
entertaining
discoveries
over
the
comical
and
shortcomings
of
their
donation
outfit
over
the
thousand
and
one
quaint
experiences
of
their
novel
relation
to
each
other
to
the
congregation
and
to
the
world
of
tyre
at
large
theron
indeed
might
be
said
never
to
have
laughed
before
up
to
that
time
no
friendly
student
of
his
character
cataloguing
his
admirable
qualities
would
have
thought
of
including
among
them
a
sense
of
humor
much
less
a
bent
toward
levity
neither
his
early
strenuous
battle
to
get
away
from
the
farm
and
achieve
such
education
as
should
serve
to
open
to
him
the
gates
of
professional
life
nor
the
later
wave
of
religious
enthusiasm
which
caught
him
up
as
he
stood
on
the
of
manhood
and
swept
him
off
into
a
veritable
new
world
of
views
and
aspirations
had
been
a
likely
school
of
merriment
people
had
prized
him
for
his
innocent
candor
and
guileless
mind
for
his
good
heart
his
pious
zeal
his
modesty
about
gifts
notably
above
the
average
but
it
had
occurred
to
none
to
suspect
in
him
a
latent
funny
side
but
who
could
be
solemn
where
alice
was
alice
in
a
quandary
over
the
complications
of
her
cooking
stove
alice
boiling
her
potatoes
all
day
and
her
eggs
for
half
an
hour
alice
ordering
twenty
pounds
of
steak
and
half
a
pound
of
sugar
and
striving
to
extract
a
breakfast
beverage
from
the
unground
clearly
not
so
tenderly
fond
and
sympathetic
a
husband
as
theron
he
began
by
laughing
because
she
laughed
and
grew
by
swift
stages
to
comprehend
then
frankly
to
share
her
amusement
from
this
it
seemed
only
a
step
to
the
development
of
a
humor
of
his
own
doubling
as
it
were
their
sportive
resources
he
found
himself
discovering
a
new
droll
aspect
in
men
and
things
his
phraseology
took
on
a
dryly
playful
form
fittingly
to
present
conceits
which
danced
up
unabashed
quite
into
the
presence
of
lofty
and
majestic
truths
he
got
from
this
nothing
but
satisfaction
it
obviously
involved
increased
claims
to
popularity
among
his
parishioners
and
consequently
magnified
powers
of
usefulness
and
it
made
life
so
much
more
a
joy
and
a
thing
to
be
thankful
for
often
in
the
midst
of
the
exchange
of
merry
quip
and
whimsical
suggestion
bright
blossoms
on
that
tree
of
strength
and
knowledge
which
he
felt
expanding
now
with
a
mighty
outward
pushing
in
all
directions
he
would
lapse
into
deep
gravity
and
ponder
with
a
swelling
heart
the
vast
unspeakable
marvel
of
his
blessedness
in
being
thus
enriched
and
humanized
by
daily
communion
with
the
most
worshipful
of
womankind
this
happy
and
good
young
couple
took
the
affections
of
tyre
by
storm
the
methodist
church
there
had
at
no
time
held
its
head
very
high
among
the
denominations
and
for
some
years
back
had
been
in
a
deplorably
sinking
state
owing
first
to
the
secession
of
the
free
methodists
and
then
to
the
incumbency
of
a
pastor
who
scandalized
the
community
by
marrying
a
black
man
to
a
white
woman
but
the
wares
changed
all
this
within
a
month
the
report
of
theron
charm
and
force
in
the
pulpit
was
crowding
the
church
building
to
its
utmost
capacity
and
that
too
with
some
of
tyre
best
people
equally
winning
was
the
atmosphere
of
jollity
and
juvenile
high
spirits
which
pervaded
the
parsonage
under
these
new
conditions
and
which
theron
and
alice
seemed
to
diffuse
wherever
they
went
thus
swimmingly
their
first
year
sped
amid
universal
acclaim
ware
had
a
recognized
social
place
quite
outside
the
restricted
limits
of
methodism
and
shone
in
it
with
an
unflagging
brilliancy
altogether
beyond
the
traditions
of
tyre
delightful
as
she
was
in
other
houses
she
was
still
more
naively
fascinating
in
her
own
quaint
and
somewhat
domicile
and
the
drab
little
parsonage
might
well
have
rattled
its
clapboards
to
see
if
it
was
not
in
dreamland
so
gay
was
the
company
so
light
were
the
hearts
which
it
sheltered
in
these
new
days
as
for
theron
the
period
was
one
of
incredible
fructification
and
output
he
scarcely
recognized
for
his
own
the
mind
which
now
was
reaching
out
on
all
sides
with
the
arms
of
an
octopus
exploring
unsuspected
mines
of
thought
bringing
in
rich
treasures
of
deduction
assimilating
building
propounding
as
if
by
some
force
quite
independent
of
him
he
could
not
look
without
blinking
timidity
at
the
radiance
of
the
path
stretched
out
before
him
leading
upward
to
dazzling
heights
of
greatness
at
the
end
of
this
first
year
the
wares
suddenly
discovered
that
they
were
eight
hundred
dollars
in
debt
the
second
year
was
spent
in
arriving
by
slow
stages
and
with
a
cruel
wealth
of
pathetic
detail
at
a
realization
of
what
being
eight
hundred
dollars
in
debt
meant
it
was
not
in
their
elastic
and
buoyant
natures
to
grasp
the
full
significance
of
the
thing
at
once
or
easily
their
position
in
the
social
structure
too
was
all
against
in
material
matters
a
general
for
example
uniformed
and
in
the
saddle
advancing
through
the
streets
with
his
staff
in
the
proud
wake
of
his
massed
walls
of
bayonets
can
not
be
imagined
as
quailing
at
the
glance
thrown
at
him
by
his
tailor
on
the
sidewalk
similarly
a
man
invested
with
sacerdotal
authority
who
baptizes
marries
and
buries
who
delivers
judgments
from
the
pulpit
which
may
not
be
questioned
in
his
hearing
and
who
receives
from
all
his
a
special
deference
of
manner
and
speech
is
in
the
nature
of
things
prone
to
see
the
book
and
the
butcher
bill
through
the
little
end
of
the
telescope
the
wares
at
the
outset
had
thought
it
right
to
trade
as
exclusively
as
possible
with
members
of
their
own
church
society
this
loyalty
became
a
principal
element
of
martyrdom
theron
had
his
creditors
seated
in
serried
rows
before
him
sunday
after
sunday
alice
had
her
critics
consolidated
among
those
whom
it
was
her
chief
duty
to
visit
and
profess
friendship
for
these
situations
now
began
by
regular
gradations
to
unfold
their
terrors
at
the
first
intimation
of
discontent
the
wares
made
what
seemed
to
them
a
sweeping
reduction
in
expenditure
when
they
heard
that
brother
potter
had
spoken
of
them
as
poor
pay
they
dismissed
their
hired
girl
a
little
later
theron
brought
himself
to
drop
a
laboriously
casual
suggestion
as
to
a
possible
increase
of
salary
and
saw
with
sinking
spirits
the
faces
of
the
stewards
freeze
with
dumb
disapprobation
then
alice
paid
a
visit
to
her
parents
only
to
find
her
brothers
doggedly
hostile
to
the
notion
of
her
being
helped
and
her
father
so
much
under
their
influence
that
the
paltry
sum
he
dared
offer
barely
covered
the
expenses
of
her
journey
with
another
turn
of
the
screw
they
sold
the
piano
she
had
brought
with
her
from
home
and
cut
themselves
down
to
the
bare
necessities
of
life
neither
receiving
company
nor
going
out
they
never
laughed
now
and
even
smiles
grew
rare
by
this
time
theron
sermons
preached
under
that
stony
glare
of
people
to
whom
he
owed
money
had
degenerated
to
a
pitiful
level
of
commonplace
as
a
consequence
the
attendance
became
once
more
confined
to
the
insufficient
membership
of
the
church
and
the
trustees
complained
of
grievously
diminished
receipts
when
the
wares
grown
desperate
ventured
upon
the
experiment
of
trading
outside
the
bounds
of
the
congregation
the
trustees
complained
again
this
time
peremptorily
thus
the
second
year
dragged
itself
miserably
to
an
end
nor
was
relief
possible
because
the
presiding
elder
knew
something
of
the
circumstances
and
felt
it
his
duty
to
send
theron
back
for
a
third
year
to
pay
his
debts
and
drain
the
cup
of
disciplinary
medicine
to
its
dregs
the
worst
has
been
told
beginning
in
utter
blackness
this
third
year
in
the
second
month
brought
a
change
as
welcome
as
it
was
unlooked
for
an
elderly
and
important
citizen
of
tyre
by
name
abram
beekman
whom
theron
knew
slightly
and
had
on
occasions
seen
sitting
in
one
of
the
back
pews
near
the
door
called
one
morning
at
the
parsonage
and
electrified
its
inhabitants
by
expressing
a
desire
to
wipe
off
all
their
old
scores
for
them
and
give
them
a
fresh
start
in
life
as
he
put
the
suggestion
they
could
find
no
excuse
for
rejecting
it
he
had
watched
them
and
heard
a
good
deal
about
them
and
took
a
fatherly
sort
of
interest
in
them
he
did
not
deprecate
their
regarding
the
aid
he
proffered
them
in
the
nature
of
a
loan
but
they
were
to
make
themselves
perfectly
easy
about
it
and
never
return
it
at
all
unless
they
could
spare
it
sometime
with
entire
convenience
and
felt
that
they
wanted
to
do
so
as
this
amazing
windfall
finally
took
shape
it
enabled
the
wares
to
live
respectably
through
the
year
and
to
leave
tyre
with
something
over
one
hundred
dollars
in
hand
it
enabled
them
too
to
revive
in
a
chastened
form
their
old
dream
of
ultimate
success
and
distinction
for
theron
he
had
demonstrated
clearly
enough
to
himself
during
that
brief
season
of
unrestrained
effulgence
that
he
had
within
him
the
making
of
a
great
pulpit
orator
he
set
to
work
now
with
resolute
purpose
to
puzzle
out
and
master
all
the
principles
which
underlie
this
art
and
all
the
tricks
that
adorn
its
superstructure
he
studied
it
fastened
his
thoughts
upon
it
talked
daily
with
alice
about
it
in
the
pulpit
addressing
those
people
who
had
so
darkened
his
life
and
crushed
the
first
happiness
out
of
his
home
he
withheld
himself
from
any
oratorical
display
which
could
afford
them
gratification
he
put
aside
as
well
the
thought
of
attracting
once
more
the
of
tyre
whose
early
enthusiasm
had
spread
such
pitfalls
for
his
unwary
feet
he
practised
effects
now
by
piecemeal
with
an
alert
ear
and
calculation
in
every
tone
an
ambition
at
once
embittered
and
tearfully
solicitous
possessed
him
he
reflected
now
this
morning
with
a
certain
incredulous
interest
upon
that
unworthy
epoch
in
his
life
history
which
seemed
so
far
behind
him
and
yet
had
come
to
a
close
only
a
few
weeks
ago
the
opportunity
had
been
given
him
there
at
the
tecumseh
conference
to
reveal
his
quality
he
had
risen
to
its
full
limit
of
possibilities
and
preached
a
great
sermon
in
a
manner
which
he
at
least
knew
was
unapproachable
he
had
made
his
most
powerful
bid
for
the
prize
place
had
trebly
deserved
success
and
had
been
banished
instead
to
octavius
the
curious
thing
was
that
he
did
not
resent
his
failure
alice
had
taken
it
hard
but
he
himself
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
spiritual
gain
the
influence
of
the
conference
with
its
songs
and
seasons
of
prayer
and
high
pressure
of
emotional
excitement
was
still
strong
upon
him
it
seemed
years
and
years
since
the
religious
side
of
him
had
been
so
stirred
into
motion
he
felt
as
he
lay
back
in
the
chair
and
folded
his
hands
over
the
book
on
his
knee
that
he
had
indeed
come
forth
from
the
fire
purified
and
strengthened
the
ministry
to
souls
diseased
beckoned
him
with
a
new
and
urgent
significance
he
smiled
to
remember
that
beekman
speaking
in
his
shrewd
and
pointed
way
had
asked
him
whether
looking
it
all
over
he
did
think
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
study
law
with
a
view
to
sliding
out
of
the
ministry
when
a
good
chance
offered
it
amazed
him
now
to
recall
that
he
had
taken
this
hint
seriously
and
even
gone
to
the
length
of
finding
out
what
books
began
upon
thank
god
all
that
was
past
and
gone
now
the
call
sounded
resonant
and
imperative
in
his
ears
and
there
was
no
impulse
of
his
heart
no
fibre
of
his
being
which
did
not
stir
in
devout
response
he
closed
his
eyes
to
be
the
more
wholly
alone
with
the
spirit
that
moved
him
the
jangling
of
a
bell
in
the
hallway
broke
sharply
upon
his
meditations
and
on
the
instant
his
wife
thrust
in
her
head
from
the
kitchen
you
have
to
go
to
the
door
theron
she
warned
him
in
a
loud
swift
whisper
i
not
fit
to
be
seen
it
is
the
all
right
he
said
and
rose
slowly
from
sprawling
recumbency
to
his
feet
i
and
do
forget
she
added
strenuously
i
believe
in
levi
gorringe
i
seen
him
go
past
here
with
his
rod
and
twice
in
eight
days
and
that
a
good
sign
he
got
a
soft
side
somewhere
and
just
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
about
the
gas
and
do
you
let
them
jew
you
down
a
solitary
cent
on
that
all
right
said
theron
again
and
moved
reluctantly
toward
the
hall
door
chapter
iii
when
the
three
trustees
had
been
shown
in
by
the
rev
ware
and
had
taken
seats
an
awkward
little
pause
ensued
the
young
minister
looked
doubtingly
from
one
face
to
another
the
while
they
glanced
with
inquiring
interest
about
the
room
noting
the
pictures
and
appraising
the
furniture
in
their
minds
the
obvious
leader
of
the
party
loren
pierce
a
rich
quarryman
was
an
old
man
of
medium
size
and
mean
attire
with
a
square
beardless
face
as
hard
and
impassive
in
expression
as
one
of
his
blocks
of
limestone
the
irregular
mouth
slightly
sunken
and
shut
with
firmness
the
short
snub
nose
and
the
little
eyes
squinting
from
lids
beneath
slightly
marked
brows
seemed
scarcely
to
attain
to
the
dignity
of
features
but
evaded
attention
instead
as
if
feeling
that
they
were
only
there
at
all
from
plain
necessity
and
ought
not
to
be
taken
into
account
pierce
face
did
not
know
how
to
smile
what
was
the
use
of
smiles
but
its
whole
surface
radiated
secretiveness
portrayed
on
canvas
by
a
master
brush
with
a
ruff
or
a
red
robe
for
masquerade
generations
of
imaginative
amateurs
would
have
seen
in
it
vast
reaching
plots
the
skeletons
of
a
dozen
dynastic
cupboards
the
guarded
mysteries
of
half
a
century
international
diplomacy
the
amateurs
would
have
been
wrong
again
there
was
nothing
behind
pierce
juiceless
countenance
more
weighty
than
a
general
determination
to
exact
seven
per
cent
for
his
money
and
some
specific
notions
about
capturing
certain
brickyards
which
were
interfering
with
his
but
octavius
watched
him
shamble
along
its
sidewalks
quite
as
the
vienna
of
dead
and
forgotten
yesterday
might
have
watched
metternich
erastus
winch
was
of
a
breezier
sort
a
florid
stout
and
sandy
man
who
spent
most
of
his
life
driving
over
evil
country
roads
in
a
buggy
securing
orders
for
dairy
furniture
and
certain
allied
lines
of
farm
utensils
this
practice
had
given
him
a
loud
voice
and
a
deceptively
hearty
manner
to
which
the
other
avocation
of
which
he
pursued
at
the
board
of
trade
meetings
every
monday
afternoon
had
added
a
considerable
command
of
persuasive
yet
language
to
look
at
him
still
more
to
hear
him
one
would
have
sworn
he
was
a
good
fellow
a
trifle
rough
and
noisy
perhaps
but
all
right
at
bottom
but
the
county
clerk
of
dearborn
county
could
have
told
you
of
agriculturists
who
knew
erastus
from
long
and
unhappy
experience
and
who
held
him
to
be
even
a
tighter
man
than
loren
pierce
in
the
matter
of
a
mortgage
the
third
trustee
levi
gorringe
set
one
wondering
at
the
very
first
glance
what
on
earth
he
was
doing
in
that
company
those
who
had
known
him
longest
had
the
least
notion
but
it
may
be
added
that
no
one
knew
him
well
he
was
a
lawyer
and
had
lived
in
octavius
for
upwards
of
ten
years
that
is
to
say
since
early
manhood
he
had
an
office
on
the
main
street
just
under
the
principal
photograph
gallery
doubtless
he
was
sometimes
in
this
office
but
his
saw
him
more
often
in
the
street
doorway
with
the
stairs
behind
him
and
the
flaring
of
the
photographer
on
either
side
standing
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
an
unlighted
cigar
in
his
mouth
looking
at
nothing
in
particular
about
every
other
day
he
went
off
after
breakfast
into
the
country
roundabout
sometimes
with
a
rod
sometimes
with
a
gun
but
always
alone
he
was
a
bachelor
and
slept
in
a
room
at
the
back
of
his
office
cooking
some
of
his
meals
himself
getting
others
at
a
restaurant
close
by
though
he
had
little
visible
practice
he
was
understood
to
be
and
even
more
and
people
tacitly
inferred
that
he
shaved
the
methodists
of
octavius
looked
upon
him
as
a
queer
fish
and
through
nearly
a
dozen
years
had
never
quite
outgrown
their
hebdomadal
tendency
to
surprise
at
seeing
him
enter
their
church
he
had
never
it
is
true
professed
religion
but
they
had
elected
him
as
a
trustee
now
for
a
number
of
terms
all
the
same
partly
because
he
was
their
only
lawyer
partly
because
he
like
both
his
colleagues
held
a
mortgage
on
the
church
edifice
and
lot
in
person
gorringe
was
a
slender
man
with
a
skin
of
a
clear
uniform
citron
tint
black
waving
hair
and
dark
gray
eyes
and
a
thin
face
he
wore
a
mustache
and
pointed
and
though
he
was
of
new
england
parentage
and
had
never
been
further
south
than
ocean
grove
he
presented
a
general
effect
of
old
mississippian
traditions
and
tastes
startlingly
at
variance
with
the
standards
of
dearborn
county
methodism
nothing
could
convince
some
of
the
elder
sisters
that
he
was
not
a
drinking
man
the
three
visitors
had
completed
their
survey
of
the
room
now
and
loren
pierce
emitted
a
dry
harsh
little
cough
as
a
signal
that
business
was
about
to
begin
at
this
sound
winch
drew
up
his
feet
and
gorringe
untied
a
parcel
of
and
papers
that
he
held
on
his
knee
theron
felt
that
his
countenance
must
be
exhibiting
to
the
assembled
brethren
an
unfortunate
sense
of
helplessness
in
their
hands
he
tried
to
look
more
resolute
and
forced
his
lips
into
a
smile
brother
gorringe
allus
acts
as
seckertary
said
erastus
winch
beaming
broadly
upon
the
minister
as
if
the
mere
mention
of
the
fact
promoted
jollity
that
it
brother
gorringe
take
your
seat
at

on
you

of
the
humorist
turned
to
theron
as
the
lawyer
walked
over
to
the
desk
at
the
window
i
allus
have
to
caution
him
about
that
he
remarked
with
great
joviality
an
do
you
look
out
afterwards
brother
ware
or
else
you
catch
that
pen
yours
scribblin
lawyer
lingo
in
place
o
the
theron
felt
bound
to
exhibit
a
grin
in
acknowledgment
of
this
pleasantry
the
lawyer
change
of
position
had
involved
some
shifting
of
the
others
chairs
and
the
young
minister
found
himself
directly
confronted
by
brother
pierce
hard
and
colorless
old
visage
its
little
eyes
were
watching
him
as
through
a
mask
and
under
their
influence
the
smile
of
politeness
fled
from
his
lips
the
lawyer
on
his
right
the
to
the
left
seemed
to
recede
into
distance
as
he
for
the
moment
returned
the
gaze
of
the
quarryman
he
waited
now
for
him
to
speak
as
if
the
others
were
of
no
importance
we
are
a
plain
sort
o
folks
up
in
these
parts
said
brother
pierce
after
a
slight
further
pause
his
voice
was
as
dry
and
rasping
as
his
cough
and
its
intonations
were
those
of
authority
we
walk
here
he
went
on
eying
the
minister
with
a
sour
regard
in
a
meek
an
humble
spirit
in
the
straight
an
narrow
way
which
leadeth
unto
life
we
gone
traipsin
after
strange
gods
like
some
people
that
call
themselves
methodists
in
other
places
we
stick
by
the
discipline
an
the
ways
of
our
fathers
in
israel
no
notions
can
go
down
here
your
wife
better
take
them
flowers
out
of
her
bunnit
afore
next
silence
possessed
the
room
for
a
few
moments
the
while
theron
and
with
brows
knit
studied
the
pattern
of
the
ingrain
carpet
then
he
lifted
his
head
and
nodded
it
in
assent
yes
he
said
we
will
do
nothing
by
which
our
stumbleth
or
is
offended
or
is
made
weak
brother
pierce
parchment
face
showed
no
sign
of
surprise
or
pleasure
at
this
easy
submission
another
thing
we
do
want
no
or
dictionary
words
in
our
pulpit
he
went
on
coldly
some
folks
may
stomach
we
wo
them
two
sermons
o
yours
they
do
down
in
some
city
place
but
they
like
your
wife
bunnit
here
too
flowery
to
suit
us
what
we
want
to
hear
is
the
plain
word
of
god
without
any
palaver
or
and
ha
they
tell
me
there
some
parts
where
hell
treated
as
where
our
ministers
do
like
to
talk
much
about
it
because
people
do
want
to
hear
about
it
such
preachers
ought
to
be
put
out
they
ai
methodists
at
all
what
we
want
here
sir
is
hell
the
burnin
lake
o
fire
an
pour
it
into
hot
an
strong
we
ca
have
too
much
of
it
work
in
them
awful
deathbeds
of
voltaire
an
tom
paine
with
the
devil
right
there
in
the
room
reachin
for
an
they
yellin
for
fright
that
what
fills
the
anxious
seat
brings
in
souls
hand
over
theron
tongue
dallied
for
an
instant
with
the
temptation
to
comment
upon
these
fables
which
were
so
dear
to
the
rural
religious
heart
when
he
and
i
were
boys
but
it
seemed
wiser
to
only
nod
again
and
let
his
mentor
go
on
we
ai
had
no
trouble
with
the
free
methodists
here
continued
brother
pierce
jest
because
we
kept
to
the
old
paths
an
seek
for
salvation
in
the
good
old
way
everybody
can
shout
as
loud
and
as
long
as
the
spirit
moves
him
with
us
some
one
was
sayin
you
thought
we
ought
to
have
a
choir
and
an
organ
no
sirree
no
such
for
us
you
only
stir
up
feelin
agin
yourself
by
at
such
things
and
then
too
our
folks
do
take
no
stock
in
all
that
pack
o
nonsense
about
science
such
as
tellin
the
age
of
the
earth
by
crackin
up
stones
i
in
the
quarry
line
all
my
life
an
i
know
it
all
humbug
why
they
say
some
folks
are
goin
round
now
that
our
grandfathers
were
all
monkeys
that
comes
from
from
the
ways
of
our
forefathers
an
puttin
in
organs
an
choirs
deckin
our
out
with
gewgaws
an
apin
the
fashions
of
the
worldly
i
should
wonder
if
them
kind
did
have
some
monkey
blood
in
you
find
we
a
different
sort
the
young
minister
preserved
silence
for
a
little
until
it
became
apparent
that
the
old
trustee
had
had
his
say
out
even
then
he
raised
his
head
slowly
and
at
last
made
answer
in
a
hesitating
and
irresolute
way
you
have
been
very
frank
he
said
i
am
obliged
to
you
a
clergyman
coming
to
a
new
charge
can
not
be
better
served
than
by
having
laid
before
him
a
clear
statement
of
the
views
and
and
spiritual
tendencies
of
his
new
flock
quite
at
the
outset
i
feel
it
to
be
of
especial
value
in
this
case
because
i
am
young
in
years
and
in
my
ministry
and
am
conscious
of
a
great
weakness
of
the
flesh
i
can
see
how
daily
contact
with
a
people
so
attached
to
the
old
simple
primitive
methodism
of
wesley
and
asbury
may
be
a
source
of
much
strength
to
me
i
may
take
it
he
added
upon
second
thought
with
an
inquiring
glance
at
winch
that
brother
pierce
description
of
our
charge
and
its
tastes
and
needs
meets
with
your
approval
erastus
winch
nodded
his
head
and
smiled
expansively
whatever
brother
pierce
says
goes
he
declared
the
lawyer
sitting
behind
at
the
desk
by
the
window
said
nothing
the
place
is
jest
overrun
with
irish
brother
pierce
began
again
they
got
two
catholic
churches
here
now
to
our
one
and
they
do
jest
as
they
blamed
please
at
the
charter
elections
it
be
a
good
idee
to
pitch
into
catholics
in
general
whenever
you
can
you
could
make
a
hit
that
way
i
say
the
state
ought
to
make
pay
taxes
on
their
church
property
they
no
right
to
be
exempted
because
they
ai
christians
at
all
they
idolaters
that
what
they
are
i
know
i
had
in
my
quarries
for
years
an
they
ai
got
no
idee
of
decency
or
fair
dealin
every
time
the
price
of
stone
went
up
every
man
of
would
jine
to
screw
more
wages
out
o
me
why
they
used
to
keep
account
o
the
amount
o
business
i
done
an
figger
up
my
profits
an
have
the
face
to
come
an
talk
to
me
about
as
if
that
had
anything
to
do
with
wages
it
my
belief
their
priests
put
up
to
it
people
do
begin
to
reelize
that
church
of
idolatry
be
the
ruin
o
this
country
if
it
ai
checked
in
time
jest
you
go
at
hammer
tongs
i
got
eyetalians
in
the
quarries
now
they
sensible
fellows
they
know
when
they
well
off
a
dollar
a
day
an
satisfied
an
everything
goes
but
they
catholics
the
same
as
the
irish
suddenly
interjected
the
lawyer
from
his
place
by
the
window
theron
pricked
up
his
ears
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
there
was
an
note
in
it
so
to
speak
which
it
did
him
good
to
hear
the
consciousness
of
sympathy
began
on
the
instant
to
inspire
him
with
courage
i
know
some
people
say
they
are
brother
pierce
guardedly
retorted
but
i
summered
an
wintered
both
kinds
an
i
hold
to
it
different
i
grant
ye
the
eyetalians
are
some
given
to
jabbin
knives
into
each
other
but
they
never
git
up
strikes
an
they
do
grumble
about
wages
why
look
at
the
way
they
live
jest
some
weeds
an
yarbs
dug
up
on
the
roadside
an
stewed
in
a
kettle
with
a
piece
o
fat
the
size
o
your
finger
an
a
loaf
o
bread
an
they
happy
as
a
king
there
some
sense
in
that
but
the
irish
they
got
to
have
meat
potatoes
an
butter
jest
as
if
as
if
as
if
they
used
to
at
home
put
in
winch
to
help
his
colleague
out
the
lawyer
ostentatiously
drew
up
his
chair
to
the
desk
and
began
turning
over
the
leaves
of
his
biggest
book
it
getting
on
toward
noon
gentlemen
he
said
in
an
impatient
voice
the
business
meeting
which
followed
was
for
a
considerable
time
confined
to
hearing
extracts
from
the
books
and
papers
read
in
a
swift
and
formal
fashion
by
gorringe
if
this
was
intended
to
inform
the
new
pastor
of
the
exact
financial
situation
in
octavius
it
lamentably
failed
of
its
purpose
theron
had
little
knowledge
of
figures
and
though
he
tried
hard
to
listen
and
to
assume
an
air
of
comprehension
he
did
not
understand
much
of
what
he
heard
in
a
general
way
he
gathered
that
the
church
property
was
put
down
at
on
which
there
was
a
debt
of
the
annual
expenses
were
of
which
the
principal
items
were
for
his
salary
for
the
rent
of
the
parsonage
and
for
interest
on
the
debt
it
seemed
that
last
year
the
receipts
had
fallen
just
under
and
they
now
confronted
the
necessity
of
making
good
this
deficit
during
the
coming
year
as
well
as
increasing
the
regular
revenues
without
much
discussion
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
endeavor
to
secure
the
services
of
a
celebrated
early
in
the
autumn
and
utilize
him
in
the
closing
days
of
a
revival
theron
knew
this
and
had
seen
him
at
work
a
burly
bustling
vulgar
man
who
took
possession
of
the
pulpit
as
if
it
were
an
auctioneer
block
and
pursued
the
task
of
exciting
liberality
in
the
bosoms
of
the
congregation
by
alternating
prayer
anecdote
song
and
cheap
buffoonery
in
a
manner
truly
sickening
would
it
not
be
preferable
he
feebly
suggested
to
raise
the
money
by
a
festival
or
fair
or
some
other
form
of
entertainment
which
the
ladies
could
manage
brother
pierce
shook
his
head
with
contemptuous
emphasis
our
ai
that
kind
he
said
they
did
try
to
hold
a
sociable
once
but
nobody
came
and
we
did
raise
more
three
or
four
dollars
it
ai
their
line
they
lack
the
worldly
arts
as
the
discipline
commands
they
avoid
the
evil
of
putting
on
gold
and
costly
apparel
and
taking
such
diversions
as
can
not
be
used
in
the
name
of
the
lord
well
of
course
if
you
prefer
the
theron
began
and
took
the
itemized
account
from
gorringe
knee
as
an
excuse
for
not
finishing
the
hateful
sentence
he
looked
down
the
foolscap
sheet
line
by
line
with
no
special
sense
of
what
it
signified
until
his
eye
caught
upon
this
little
section
of
the
report
bracketed
by
itself
in
the
secretary
neat
hand
interest
charge
first
mortgage
winch
second
mortgage
gorringe
third
mortgage
pierce
it
was
no
news
to
him
that
the
three
mortgages
on
the
church
property
were
held
by
the
three
trustees
but
as
he
looked
once
more
another
feature
of
the
thing
struck
him
as
curious
i
notice
that
the
rates
of
interest
vary
he
remarked
without
thinking
and
then
wished
the
words
unsaid
for
the
two
trustees
in
view
moved
uneasily
on
their
seats
oh
that
nothing
exclaimed
erastus
winch
with
a
boisterous
display
of
jollity
it
only
brother
gorringe
pleasant
little
way
of
making
a
contribution
to
our
funds
you
will
notice
that
at
the
date
of
all
these
mortgages
the
state
rate
of
interest
was
seven
per
cent
since
then
it
lowered
to
six
well
when
that
happened
you
see
brother
gorringe
not
being
a
professin
member
and
so
not
bound
by
our
rules
he
could
just
as
well
as
not
let
his
interest
down
a
cent
but
brother
pierce
an
me
we
talked
it
over
an
we
made
up
our
minds
we
were
tied
hand
an
foot
by
our
contract
you
know
how
strong
the
discipline
lays
it
down
that
we
must
be
bound
to
the
letter
of
our
agreements
that
bein
so
we
seen
it
in
the
light
of
duty
not
to
change
what
we
set
our
hands
to
that
how
it
is
brother
i
understand
said
theron
with
an
effort
at
polite
calmness
of
tone
and
is
there
anything
else
there
this
broke
in
brother
pierce
we
commanded
to
be
people
an
seven
per
cent
was
the
law
an
would
be
now
if
them
ragamuffins
in
the
legislation
surely
we
need
go
further
into
that
interrupted
the
minister
conscious
of
a
growing
stiffness
in
his
moral
spine
have
we
any
other
business
before
us
brother
pierce
little
eyes
snapped
and
the
wrinkles
in
his
forehead
deepened
angrily
business
he
demanded
yes
plenty
of
it
got
to
reduce
expenses
we
nigh
onto
this
minute
besides
your
you
get
free
an
clear
that
is
every
week
an
only
you
an
your
wife
to
keep
out
of
it
why
when
i
was
your
age
young
man
and
after
that
too
i
was
glad
to
get
a
i
do
think
my
salary
is
under
discussion
pierce
brother
pierce
suggested
winch
in
a
undertone
brother
pierce
then
echoed
theron
impatiently
the
quarterly
conference
and
the
estimating
committee
deal
with
that
the
trustees
have
no
more
to
do
with
it
than
the
man
in
the
come
come
brother
ware
put
in
erastus
winch
we
must
have
no
hard
feelin
brotherly
love
is
what
we
all
lookin
after
brother
pierce
meanin
was
agin
your
drawin
your
full
salary
every
cent
of
it
only
only
there
are
certain
little
things
connected
with
the
parsonage
here
that
we
feel
you
ought
to
bear
instance
there
the
new
sidewalk
we
had
to
lay
in
front
of
the
house
here
only
a
month
ago
of
course
if
the
treasury
was
flush
we
would
say
a
word
about
it
an
then
there
the
gas
bill
here
seein
as
you
get
your
rent
for
nothin
it
do
seem
much
to
ask
that
you
should
see
to
lightin
the
place
no
i
do
think
that
either
is
a
proper
charge
upon
me
interposed
theron
i
decline
to
pay
we
can
have
the
gas
shut
off
remarked
brother
pierce
coldly
as
soon
as
you
like
responded
the
minister
sitting
erect
and
tapping
the
carpet
nervously
with
his
foot
only
you
must
understand
that
i
will
take
the
whole
matter
to
the
quarterly
conference
in
july
i
already
see
a
good
many
other
interesting
questions
about
the
financial
management
of
this
church
which
might
be
appropriately
discussed
oh
come

broke
in

with
a
somewhat
agitated
assumption

are
matters

ought
to
settle
amongst
ourselves

outsiders

with
our

gingerly
to
his
feet
with
the
hesitation
of
an
old
man
not
sure
about
his
knees
when
he
had
straightened
himself
he
put
on
his
hat
and
eyed
the
minister
sternly
from
beneath
its
brim
the
lord
gives
us
crosses
grievous
to
our
natur
he
said
an
told
to

cheerfully
as
long
as

he
pulled
his
soft
and
discolored
old
hat
down
over
his
brows
with
a
significantly
hostile
nod
and
turning
stumped
toward
the
without
offering
to
shake
hands
the
other
trustees
had
risen
likewise
in
tacit
recognition
that
the
meeting
was
over
winch
clasped
the
minister
hand
in
his
own
broad
hard
palm
and
squeezed
it
in
an
exuberant
grip

his
little
ways
brother

he
urged
in
a
loud
unctuous
whisper
with
a
grinning
backward
nod
he
a
trifle
skittish
sometimes
when
you
give
him
free
rein
but
he
all
wool
an
a
yard
wide
when
it
comes
to
religion
my
love
to
sister
ware
and
he
followed
the
senior
trustee
into
the
hall
gorringe
had
been
tying
up
his
books
and
papers
he
came
now
with
the
bulky
parcel
under
his
arm
and
his
hat
and
stick
in
the
other
hand
he
could
give
little
but
his
thumb
to
theron
to
shake
his
face
wore
a
grave
expression
and
not
a
line
relaxed
as
catching
the
look
he
slowly
covered
his
left
eye
in
a
deliberate
wink
well
and
how
did
it
go
off
asked
alice
from
where
she
knelt
by
the
oven
door
a
few
minutes
later
for
answer
theron
threw
himself
wearily
into
the
big
old
farm
on
the
other
side
of
the
stove
and
shook
his
head
with
a
lengthened
sigh
if
it
was
for
that
man
gorringe
of
yours
he
said
dejectedly
i
think
i
should
feel
like
going
off
and
learning
a
chapter
iv
on
the
following
sunday
young
ware
sat
alone
in
the
preacher
pew
through
the
morning
service
and
everybody
noted
that
the
roses
had
been
taken
from
her
bonnet
in
the
evening
she
was
absent
and
after
the
doxology
and
benediction
several
people
under
the
pretence
of
solicitude
for
her
health
tried
to
pump
her
husband
as
to
the
reason
he
answered
their
inquiries
civilly
enough
but
with
brevity
she
had
stayed
at
home
because
she
did
not
feel
like
coming
out
this
and
nothing
more
the
congregation
dispersed
under
a
cloud
of
consciousness
that
there
must
be
something
queer
about
sister
ware
there
was
a
tolerably
general
agreement
however
that
the
two
sermons
of
the
day
had
been
excellent
not
even
loren
pierce
railing
commentary
on
the
pastor
introduction
of
an
outlandish
word
like
epitome
clearly
forbidden
by
the
discipline
injunction
to
plain
language
understood
of
the
people
availed
to
sap
the
satisfaction
of
the
majority
theron
himself
comprehended
that
he
had
pleased
the
bulk
of
his
auditors
the
knowledge
left
him
curiously
hot
and
cold
on
the
one
hand
there
was
joy
in
the
apparent
prospect
that
the
congregation
would
back
him
up
in
a
stand
against
the
trustees
if
worst
came
to
worst
but
on
the
other
hand
the
bonnet
episode
entered
his
soul
it
had
been
a
source
of
bitter
humiliation
to
him
to
see
his
wife
sitting
there
beneath
the
pulpit
shorn
by
despotic
order
of
the
adornments
natural
to
her
pretty
head
but
he
had
even
greater
pain
in
contemplating
the
effect
it
had
produced
on
alice
herself
she
had
said
not
a
word
on
the
subject
but
her
every
glance
and
gesture
seemed
to
him
eloquent
of
deep
feeling
about
it
he
made
sure
that
she
blamed
him
for
having
defended
his
own
gas
and
sidewalk
rights
with
successful
vigor
but
permitted
the
sacrifice
of
her
poor
little
inoffensive
roses
without
a
protest
in
this
view
of
the
matter
indeed
he
blamed
himself
was
it
too
late
to
make
the
error
good
he
ventured
a
hint
on
this
sunday
evening
when
he
returned
to
the
parsonage
and
found
her
reading
an
old
weekly
newspaper
by
the
light
of
the
kitchen
lamp
to
the
effect
that
he
fancied
there
would
be
no
great
danger
in
putting
those
roses
back
into
her
bonnet
without
lifting
her
eyes
from
the
paper
she
answered
that
she
had
no
earthly
desire
to
wear
roses
in
her
bonnet
and
went
on
with
her
reading
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
theron
found
himself
in
command
of
an
unusual
fund
of
humorous
good
spirits
and
was
at
pains
to
make
the
most
of
it
passing
whimsical
comments
on
subjects
which
the
opening
day
suggested
recalling
quaint
and
comical
memories
of
the
past
and
striving
his
best
to
force
alice
into
a
laugh
formerly
her
merry
temper
had
always
ignited
at
the
merest
spark
of
gayety
now
she
gave
his
jokes
only
a
dutiful
and
uttered
scarcely
a
word
in
response
to
his
running
fire
of
talk
when
the
meal
was
finished
she
went
silently
to
work
to
clear
away
the
dishes
theron
turned
over
in
his
mind
the
project
of
offering
to
help
her
as
he
had
done
so
often
in
those
dear
old
days
when
they
laughingly
began
life
together
something
decided
this
project
in
the
negative
for
him
and
after
lingering
moments
he
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
for
a
walk
not
even
the
most
doleful
and
trying
hour
of
his
bitter
experience
in
tyre
had
depressed
him
like
this
looking
back
upon
these
past
troubles
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
had
borne
them
all
with
a
light
and
cheerful
heart
simply
because
alice
had
been
one
with
him
in
every
thought
and
emotion
how
perfect
how
ideally
complete
their
sympathy
had
always
been
with
what
absolute
unity
of
mind
and
soul
they
had
trod
that
difficult
path
together
and
now
henceforth
was
it
to
be
different
the
mere
suggestion
of
such
a
thing
chilled
his
veins
he
said
aloud
to
himself
as
he
walked
that
life
would
be
an
intolerable
curse
if
alice
were
to
cease
sharing
it
with
him
in
every
conceivable
phase
he
had
made
his
way
out
of
town
and
tramped
along
the
country
for
a
considerable
distance
before
a
merciful
light
began
to
lessen
the
shadows
in
the
picture
of
gloom
with
which
his
mind
tortured
itself
all
at
once
he
stopped
short
lifted
his
head
and
looked
about
him
the
broad
valley
lay
warm
and
tranquil
in
the
may
sunshine
at
his
feet
in
the
thicket
up
the
above
him
a
gray
squirrel
was
chattering
shrilly
and
the
birds
sang
in
a
tireless
choral
confusion
theron
smiled
and
drew
a
long
breath
the
gay
clamor
of
the
woodland
songsters
the
placid
radiance
of
the
landscape
were
suddenly
taken
in
and
made
a
part
of
his
new
mood
he
listened
smiled
once
more
and
then
started
in
a
leisurely
way
back
toward
octavius
how
could
he
have
been
so
ridiculous
as
to
fancy
that
alice
his
alice
had
been
changed
into
someone
else
he
marvelled
now
at
his
own
perverse
folly
she
was
overworked
tired
out
that
was
all
the
task
of
moving
in
of
setting
the
new
household
to
rights
had
been
too
much
for
her
she
must
have
a
rest
they
must
get
in
a
hired
girl
once
this
decision
about
a
servant
fixed
itself
in
the
young
mind
it
drove
out
the
last
vestage
of
discomfort
he
strode
along
now
in
great
content
revolving
idly
a
dozen
different
plans
for
gilding
and
beautifying
this
new
life
of
leisure
into
which
his
sanguine
thoughts
projected
alice
one
of
these
particularly
pleased
him
and
waxed
in
definiteness
as
he
turned
it
over
and
over
he
would
get
another
piano
for
her
in
place
of
that
which
had
been
sacrificed
in
tyre
that
beneficient
modern
invention
the
instalment
plan
made
this
quite
feasible
so
easy
in
fact
that
it
almost
seemed
as
if
he
should
find
his
wife
playing
on
the
new
instrument
when
he
got
home
he
would
stop
in
at
the
music
store
and
see
about
it
that
very
day
of
course
now
that
these
important
resolutions
had
been
taken
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
he
could
do
something
to
bring
in
some
extra
money
this
was
by
no
means
a
new
notion
he
had
mused
over
the
possibility
in
a
formless
way
ever
since
that
memorable
discovery
of
indebtedness
in
tyre
and
had
long
ago
recognized
the
hopelessness
of
endeavor
in
every
channel
save
that
of
literature
latterly
his
fancy
had
been
stimulated
by
reading
an
account
of
the
profits
which
canon
farrar
had
derived
from
his
life
of
if
such
a
book
could
command
such
a
bewildering
multitude
of
readers
theron
felt
there
ought
to
be
a
chance
for
him
so
clear
did
constant
rumination
render
this
assumption
that
the
young
pastor
in
time
had
come
to
regard
this
prospective
book
of
his
as
a
substantial
asset
which
could
be
realized
without
trouble
whenever
he
got
around
to
it
he
had
not
it
is
true
gone
to
the
length
of
seriously
considering
what
should
be
the
subject
of
his
book
that
had
not
seemed
to
him
to
matter
much
so
long
as
it
was
scriptural
familiarity
with
the
process
of
extracting
a
fixed
amount
of
spiritual
and
intellectual
meat
from
any
casual
text
week
after
week
had
given
him
an
idea
that
any
one
of
many
subjects
would
do
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
make
a
choice
he
realized
now
that
the
time
for
a
selection
had
arrived
and
almost
simultaneously
found
himself
with
a
decision
in
his
mind
the
book
should
be
about
abraham
theron
ware
was
extremely
interested
in
the
mechanism
of
his
own
brain
and
followed
its
workings
with
a
lively
curiosity
nothing
could
be
more
remarkable
he
thought
than
to
thus
discover
that
on
the
instant
of
his
formulating
a
desire
to
know
what
he
should
write
upon
lo
and
behold
there
his
mind
quite
on
its
own
initiative
had
the
answer
waiting
for
him
when
he
had
gone
a
little
further
and
the
powerful
range
of
possibilities
in
the
son
revolt
against
the
idolatry
of
his
father
the
in
the
exodus
from
the
unholy
city
of
ur
and
in
the
influence
of
the
new
nomadic
life
upon
the
little
deistic
family
group
had
begun
to
unfold
itself
before
him
he
felt
that
the
hand
of
providence
was
plainly
discernible
in
the
matter
the
book
was
to
be
blessed
from
its
very
inception
walking
homeward
briskly
now
with
his
eyes
on
the
sidewalk
and
his
mind
all
aglow
with
crowding
suggestions
for
the
new
work
and
impatience
to
be
at
it
he
came
abruptly
upon
a
group
of
men
and
boys
who
occupied
the
whole
path
and
were
moving
forward
so
noiselessly
that
he
had
not
heard
them
coming
he
almost
ran
into
the
leader
of
this
little
procession
and
began
a
stammering
apology
the
final
words
of
which
were
left
unspoken
so
solemnly
heedless
of
him
and
his
talk
were
all
the
faces
he
saw
in
the
centre
of
the
group
were
four
bearing
between
them
an
extemporized
litter
of
two
poles
and
a
blanket
hastily
secured
across
them
with
spikes
most
of
what
this
litter
held
was
covered
by
another
blanket
rounded
in
coarse
folds
over
a
shapeless
bulk
from
beneath
its
farther
end
protruded
a
big
black
beard
thrown
upward
at
such
an
angle
as
to
hide
everything
beyond
to
those
in
front
the
tall
young
minister
stepping
aside
and
standing
could
see
sloping
downward
behind
this
hedge
of
beard
a
pinched
and
face
with
staring
eyes
its
lips
of
a
dull
lilac
hue
were
moving
ceaselessly
and
made
a
dry
clicking
sound
theron
instinctively
joined
himself
to
those
who
followed
the
litter
a
motley
dozen
of
street
idlers
chiefly
boys
one
of
these
in
whispers
explained
to
him
that
the
man
was
one
of
jerry
madden
workmen
in
the
who
had
been
deployed
to
trim
an
in
front
of
his
employer
house
and
being
unused
to
such
work
had
fallen
from
the
top
and
broken
all
his
bones
they
would
have
cared
for
him
at
house
but
he
had
insisted
upon
being
taken
home
his
name
was
macevoy
and
he
was
joey
macevoy
father
and
likewise
jim
and
hughey
and
martin
after
a
pause
the
lad
a
freckled
barefooted
wee
irishman
volunteered
the
further
information
that
his
big
brother
had
run
to
bring
father
forbess
on
the
chance
that
he
might
be
in
time
to
administer
extry
the
way
of
the
silent
little
procession
led
through
back
streets
where
women
hanging
up
clothes
in
the
yards
hurried
to
the
gates
their
aprons
full
of
to
stare
at
the
and
came
to
a
halt
at
last
in
an
irregular
and
muddy
lane
before
one
of
a
half
dozen
shanties
reared
among
the
and
debris
of
the
town
most
bedraggled
outskirts
a
stout
woman
already
warned
by
some
messenger
of
calamity
stood
waiting
on
the
roadside
bank
there
were
whimpering
children
clinging
to
her
skirts
and
a
surrounding
cluster
of
women
of
the
neighborhood
some
of
the
more
elderly
of
whom
shrivelled
little
crones
in
tidy
caps
and
with
their
aprons
to
their
eyes
were
beginning
in
a
minor
the
wail
which
presently
should
rise
into
the
keen
of
death
macevoy
herself
made
no
moan
and
her
broad
ruddy
face
was
stern
in
expression
rather
than
sorrowful
when
the
litter
stopped
beside
her
she
laid
a
hand
for
an
instant
on
her
husband
wet
brow
and
looked
one
could
have
sworn
impassively
into
his
staring
eyes
then
still
without
a
word
she
waved
the
bearers
toward
the
door
and
led
the
way
herself
theron
somewhat
wonderingly
found
himself
a
minute
later
inside
a
dark
and
room
the
air
of
which
was
humid
with
the
steam
from
a
boiler
of
clothes
on
the
stove
and
not
in
other
ways
improved
by
the
presence
of
a
jostling
score
of
women
all
straining
their
gaze
upon
the
open
door
of
the
only
other
apartment
the
through
this
they
could
see
the
workmen
laying
macevoy
on
the
bed
and
standing
awkwardly
about
thereafter
getting
in
the
way
of
the
wife
and
old
maggie
quirk
as
they
strove
to
remove
the
garments
from
his
crushed
limbs
as
the
neighbors
watched
what
could
be
seen
of
these
proceedings
they
whispered
among
themselves
eulogies
of
the
injured
man
industry
and
good
temper
his
habit
of
bringing
his
money
home
to
his
wife
and
the
way
he
kept
his
father
mathew
pledge
and
attended
to
his
religious
duties
they
admitted
freely
that
by
the
light
of
his
example
their
own
husbands
and
sons
left
much
to
be
desired
and
from
this
wandered
easily
off
into
domestic
digressions
of
their
own
but
all
the
while
their
eyes
were
bent
upon
the
bedroom
door
and
theron
made
out
after
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
gloom
and
the
smell
that
many
of
them
were
telling
their
beads
even
while
they
kept
the
muttered
conversation
alive
none
of
them
paid
any
attention
to
him
or
seemed
to
regard
his
presence
there
as
unusual
presently
he
saw
enter
through
the
sunlit
street
doorway
a
person
of
a
different
class
the
bright
light
shone
for
a
passing
instant
upon
a
fashionable
flowered
hat
and
upon
some
remarkably
brilliant
shade
of
red
hair
beneath
it
in
another
moment
there
had
edged
along
through
the
throng
to
almost
within
touch
of
him
a
tall
young
woman
the
owner
of
this
hat
and
wonderful
hair
she
was
clad
in
light
and
pleasing
spring
attire
and
carried
a
parasol
with
a
long
oxidized
silver
handle
of
a
quaint
pattern
she
looked
at
him
and
he
saw
that
her
face
was
of
a
lengthened
oval
with
a
luminous
skin
full
red
lips
and
big
brown
frank
eyes
with
heavy
auburn
lashes
she
made
a
grave
little
inclination
of
her
head
toward
him
and
he
bowed
in
response
since
her
arrival
he
noted
the
chattering
of
the
others
had
entirely
ceased
i
followed
the
others
in
in
the
hope
that
i
might
be
of
some
assistance
he
ventured
to
explain
to
her
in
a
low
murmur
feeling
that
at
last
here
was
some
one
to
whom
an
explanation
of
his
presence
in
this
romish
house
was
due
i
hope
they
wo
feel
that
i
have
she
nodded
her
head
as
if
she
quite
understood
they
take
the
will
for
the
deed
she
whispered
back
father
forbes
will
be
here
in
a
minute
do
you
know
is
it
too
late
even
as
she
spoke
the
outer
doorway
was
darkened
by
the
commanding
bulk
of
a
newcomer
figure
the
flash
of
a
silk
hat
and
the
deferential
way
in
which
the
assembled
neighbors
fell
back
to
clear
a
passage
made
his
identity
clear
theron
felt
his
blood
tingle
in
an
unaccustomed
way
as
this
priest
of
a
strange
church
advanced
across
the
room
a
portly
man
of
more
than
middle
height
with
a
shapely
face
of
almost
waxen
pallor
and
a
firm
commanding
tread
he
carried
in
his
hands
besides
his
hat
a
small
case
to
this
and
to
him
the
women
courtesied
and
bowed
their
heads
as
he
passed
come
with
me
whispered
the
tall
girl
with
the
parasol
to
theron
and
he
found
himself
pushing
along
in
her
wake
until
they
intercepted
the
priest
just
outside
the
bedroom
door
she
touched
father
forbes
on
the
arm
just
to
tell
you
that
i
am
here
she
said
the
priest
nodded
with
a
grave
face
and
passed
into
the
other
room
in
a
minute
or
two
the
workmen
macevoy
and
her
helper
came
out
and
the
door
was
shut
behind
them
he
is
making
his
confession
explained
the
young
lady
stay
here
for
a
she
moved
over
to
where
the
woman
of
the
house
stood
and
tearless
and
whispered
something
to
her
a
confused
movement
among
the
crowd
followed
and
out
of
it
presently
resulted
a
small
table
covered
with
a
white
cloth
and
bearing
on
it
two
unlighted
candles
a
basin
of
water
and
a
spoon
which
was
brought
forward
and
placed
in
readiness
before
the
closed
door
some
of
those
nearest
this
cleared
space
were
kneeling
now
and
murmuring
a
low
buzz
of
prayer
to
the
click
of
beads
on
their
rosaries
the
door
opened
and
theron
saw
the
priest
standing
in
the
doorway
with
an
uplifted
hand
he
wore
now
a
surplice
with
a
purple
band
over
his
shoulders
and
on
his
pale
face
there
shone
a
tranquil
and
tender
light
one
of
the
workmen
fetched
from
the
stove
a
brand
lighted
the
two
candles
and
bore
the
table
with
its
contents
into
the
bedroom
the
young
woman
plucked
theron
sleeve
and
he
dumbly
followed
her
into
the
chamber
of
death
making
one
of
the
group
of
a
dozen
headed
by
macevoy
and
her
children
which
filled
the
little
room
and
overflowed
now
outward
to
the
street
door
he
found
himself
bowing
with
the
others
to
receive
the
sprinkled
holy
water
from
the
priest
white
fingers
kneeling
with
the
others
for
the
prayers
following
in
impressed
silence
with
the
others
the
strange
ceremonial
by
which
the
priest
traced
crosses
of
holy
oil
with
his
thumb
upon
the
eyes
ears
nostrils
lips
hands
and
feet
of
the
dying
man
wiping
off
the
oil
with
a
piece
of
each
time
after
he
had
repeated
the
invocation
to
forgiveness
for
that
particular
sense
but
most
of
all
he
was
moved
by
the
rich
novel
sound
of
the
latin
as
the
priest
rolled
it
forth
in
the
asperges
me
domine
and
misereatur
vestri
omnipotens
deus
with
its
soft
continental
vowels
and
liquid
r
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
really
heard
latin
before
then
the
astonishing
young
woman
with
the
red
hair
declaimed
the
confiteor
vigorously
and
with
a
resonant
distinctness
of
enunciation
it
was
a
different
latin
harsher
and
more
sonorous
and
while
it
still
dominated
the
murmured
undertone
of
the
other
prayers
the
last
moment
came
theron
had
stood
face
to
face
with
death
at
many
other
bedsides
no
other
final
scene
had
stirred
him
like
this
it
must
have
been
the
girl
latin
chant
with
its
clanging
reiteration
of
the
great
names
beatum
michaelem
archangelum
beatum
joannem
baptistam
sanctos
apostolos
petrum
et
paulum
invoked
with
such
proud
confidence
in
this
squalid
little
shanty
which
so
strangely
affected
him
he
came
out
with
the
others
at
last
the
candles
and
the
folded
hands
over
the
crucifix
left
behind
and
walked
as
one
in
a
dream
even
by
the
time
that
he
had
gained
the
outer
doorway
and
stood
blinking
at
the
bright
light
and
filling
his
lungs
with
honest
air
once
more
it
had
begun
to
seem
incredible
to
him
that
he
had
seen
and
done
all
this
chapter
v
while
ware
stood
thus
on
the
doorstep
through
a
minute
of
formless
musing
the
priest
and
the
girl
came
out
and
somewhat
to
his
confusion
made
him
one
of
their
party
he
felt
himself
flushing
under
the
idea
that
they
would
think
he
had
waited
for
them
was
thrusting
himself
upon
them
the
notion
prompted
him
to
bow
frigidly
in
response
to
father
forbes
pleasant
i
am
glad
to
meet
you
sir
and
his
outstretched
hand
i
dropped
in
by
the
the
merest
accident
theron
said
i
met
them
bringing
the
poor
man
home
and
and
quite
without
thinking
i
obeyed
the
impulse
to
follow
them
in
and
did
realize
he
stopped
short
annoyed
by
the
reflection
that
this
was
his
second
apology
the
girl
smiled
placidly
at
him
the
while
she
put
up
her
parasol
it
did
me
good
to
see
you
there
she
said
quite
as
if
she
had
known
him
all
her
life
and
so
it
did
the
rest
of
father
forbes
permitted
himself
a
soft
little
chuckle
approving
rather
than
mirthful
and
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
with
the
air
of
being
fifty
years
her
senior
instead
of
fifteen
to
the
minister
relief
he
changed
the
subject
as
the
three
started
together
toward
the
road
then
again
no
doctor
was
sent
for
he
exclaimed
as
if
resuming
a
familiar
subject
with
the
girl
then
he
turned
to
theron
i
you
have
no
such
trouble
but
with
our
poorer
people
it
is
very
vexing
they
will
not
call
in
a
physician
but
hurry
off
first
for
the
clergyman
i
do
know
that
it
is
altogether
to
avoid
doctor
bills
but
it
amounts
to
that
in
effect
of
course
in
this
case
it
made
no
difference
but
i
have
had
to
make
it
a
rule
not
to
go
out
at
night
unless
they
bring
me
a
physician
card
with
his
assurance
that
it
is
a
genuine
affair
why
only
last
winter
i
was
routed
up
after
midnight
and
brought
off
in
the
mud
and
pelting
rain
up
one
of
the
new
streets
on
the
hillside
there
simply
because
a
factory
girl
who
was
laced
too
tight
had
fainted
at
a
dance
i
slipped
and
fell
into
a
puddle
in
the
darkness
ruined
a
new
overcoat
and
got
drenched
to
the
skin
and
when
i
arrived
the
girl
had
recovered
and
was
dancing
away
again
thirteen
to
the
dozen
it
was
then
that
i
made
the
rule
i
hope
ware
that
octavius
is
producing
a
pleasant
impression
upon
you
so
far
i
scarcely
know
yet
answered
theron
the
genial
talk
of
the
priest
with
its
whimsical
anecdote
had
in
truth
passed
over
his
head
his
mind
still
had
room
for
nothing
but
that
novel
scene
with
the
winged
captain
of
the
angelic
host
the
baptist
the
glorified
fisherman
and
the
preacher
all
being
summoned
down
in
the
pomp
of
liturgical
latin
to
help
macevoy
to
die
if
you
do
mind
my
saying
so
he
added
hesitatingly
what
i
have
just
seen
in
there
did
make
a
very
powerful
impression
upon
it
is
a
very
ancient
ceremony
said
the
priest
probably
persian
like
the
baptismal
form
although
for
that
matter
we
can
never
dig
deep
enough
for
the
roots
of
these
things
they
all
turn
up
turanian
if
we
probe
far
enough
our
ways
separate
here
i
afraid
i
am
delighted
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
ware
pray
look
in
upon
me
if
you
can
as
well
as
not
we
are
near
neighbors
you
father
forbes
had
shaken
hands
and
moved
off
up
another
street
some
distance
before
the
voice
of
the
girl
recalled
theron
to
himself
of
course
you
knew
him
by
name
she
was
saying
and
he
knew
you
by
sight
and
had
talked
of
you
but
my
poor
inferior
sex
has
to
be
introduced
i
am
celia
madden
my
father
has
the
and
i
i
play
the
organ
at
the
i
i
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
said
theron
conscious
as
he
spoke
that
he
had
slavishly
echoed
the
formula
of
the
priest
he
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
add
than
unfortunately
we
have
no
organ
in
our
the
girl
laughed
as
they
resumed
their
walk
down
the
street
afraid
i
could
undertake
two
she
said
and
laughed
again
then
she
spoke
more
seriously
that
ceremony
must
have
interested
you
a
good
deal
never
having
seen
it
before
i
saw
that
it
was
all
new
to
you
and
so
i
made
bold
to
take
you
under
my
wing
so
to
you
were
very
kind
said
the
young
minister
it
was
really
a
great
experience
for
me
may
may
i
ask
is
it
a
part
of
your
functions
in
the
church
i
mean
to
attend
these
last
rites
mercy
no
replied
the
girl
spinning
the
parasol
on
her
shoulder
and
smiling
at
the
thought
no
it
was
only
because
macevoy
was
one
of
our
workmen
and
really
came
by
his
death
through
father
sending
him
up
to
trim
a
tree
ann
macevoy
will
never
forgive
us
that
the
longest
day
she
lives
did
you
notice
her
she
would
speak
to
me
after
you
came
out
i
tried
to
tell
her
that
we
would
look
out
for
her
and
the
children
but
all
she
would
say
to
me
was
fwat
would
a
wheelwright
an
him
the
father
of
a
family
be
doin
up
a
tree
they
had
come
now
upon
the
main
street
of
the
village
with
its
flagstone
sidewalk
overhung
by
a
lofty
canopy
of
here
for
the
space
of
a
block
was
concentrated
such
fashionable
elegance
of
mansions
and
ornamental
lawns
as
octavius
had
to
offer
and
it
was
presented
with
the
irregularity
so
characteristic
of
our
restless
civilization
two
or
three
of
the
houses
survived
untouched
from
the
earlier
days
prim
decorous
structures
each
with
its
gabled
centre
and
lower
wings
each
with
its
row
of
fluted
columns
supporting
the
classical
roof
of
a
piazza
across
its
whole
front
each
vying
with
the
others
in
the
whiteness
of
those
wooden
walls
enveloping
its
bright
green
blinds
one
had
to
look
over
picket
fences
to
see
these
houses
and
in
doing
so
caught
the
notion
that
they
thus
railed
themselves
off
in
pride
at
being
able
to
remember
before
the
railroad
came
to
the
village
or
the
were
thought
of
before
the
neighboring
properties
the
fences
had
been
swept
away
so
that
one
might
stroll
from
the
sidewalk
straight
across
the
sward
to
any
one
of
a
dozen
elaborately
modern
doorways
some
of
the
residences
thus
frankly
proffering
friendship
to
the
were
of
wood
painted
in
drabs
and
dusky
reds
with
bulging
windows
which
marked
the
native
yearning
for
the
mediaeval
and
shingles
that
strove
to
be
accounted
tiles
others
a
prouder
less
pretentious
sort
were
of
brick
or
stone
with
mouldings
set
into
the
walls
and
with
real
slates
covering
the
riot
of
turrets
and
peaks
and
dormer
peepholes
overhead
celia
madden
stopped
in
front
of
the
largest
and
most
of
these
new
edifices
and
said
holding
out
her
hand
here
i
am
once
more
theron
hoped
that
his
manner
did
not
betray
the
flash
of
surprise
he
felt
in
discovering
that
his
new
acquaintance
lived
in
the
biggest
house
in
octavius
he
remembered
now
that
some
one
had
pointed
it
out
as
the
abode
of
the
owner
of
the
wagon
factories
but
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
to
associate
this
girl
with
that
village
magnate
it
was
stupid
of
him
of
course
because
she
had
herself
mentioned
her
father
he
looked
at
her
again
with
an
awkward
smile
as
he
formally
shook
the
gloved
hand
she
gave
him
and
lifted
his
soft
hat
the
strong
noon
sunlight
forcing
its
way
down
between
the
elms
and
beating
upon
her
parasol
of
creamy
silk
made
a
halo
about
her
hair
and
face
at
once
brilliant
and
tender
he
had
not
seen
before
how
beautiful
she
was
she
nodded
in
recognition
of
his
salute
and
moved
up
the
lawn
walk
spinning
the
sunshade
on
her
shoulder
though
the
parsonage
was
only
three
blocks
away
the
young
minister
had
time
to
think
about
a
good
many
things
before
he
reached
home
first
of
all
he
had
to
revise
in
part
the
arrangement
of
his
notions
about
the
irish
save
for
an
occasional
isolated
and
taciturn
figure
among
the
nomadic
portion
of
the
hired
help
in
the
farm
country
theron
had
scarcely
ever
spoken
to
a
person
of
this
curiously
alien
race
before
he
remembered
now
that
there
had
been
some
dozen
or
more
irish
families
in
tyre
quartered
in
the
outskirts
among
the
brickyards
but
he
had
never
come
in
contact
with
any
of
them
or
given
to
their
existence
even
a
passing
thought
so
far
as
personal
acquaintance
went
the
irish
had
been
to
him
only
a
name
but
what
a
sinister
and
repellent
name
his
views
on
this
general
subject
were
merely
those
common
to
his
communion
and
his
environment
he
took
it
for
granted
for
example
that
in
the
large
cities
most
of
the
poverty
and
all
the
drunkenness
crime
and
political
corruption
were
due
to
the
perverse
qualities
of
this
foreign
people
qualities
accentuated
and
emphasized
in
every
evil
direction
by
the
baleful
influence
of
a
false
and
idolatrous
religion
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
he
had
never
encountered
a
dissenting
opinion
on
this
point
his
boyhood
had
been
spent
in
those
bitter
days
when
social
political
and
blood
prejudices
were
fused
at
white
heat
in
the
public
crucible
together
when
he
went
to
the
church
seminary
it
was
a
matter
of
course
that
every
member
of
the
faculty
was
a
republican
and
that
every
one
of
his
classmates
had
come
from
a
republican
household
when
later
on
he
entered
the
ministry
the
rule
was
still
incredulous
of
exceptions
one
might
as
well
have
looked
in
the
nedahma
conference
for
a
divergence
of
opinion
on
the
trinity
as
for
a
difference
in
political
conviction
indeed
even
among
the
laity
theron
could
not
feel
sure
that
he
had
ever
known
a
democrat
that
is
at
all
closely
he
understood
very
little
about
politics
it
is
true
if
he
had
been
driven
into
a
corner
and
forced
to
attempt
an
explanation
of
this
tremendous
partisan
unity
in
which
he
had
a
share
he
would
probably
have
first
mentioned
the
war
the
last
shots
of
which
were
fired
while
he
was
still
in
petticoats
certainly
his
second
reason
however
would
have
been
that
the
irish
were
on
the
other
side
he
had
never
before
had
occasion
to
formulate
even
in
his
own
thoughts
this
tacit
race
and
religious
aversion
in
which
he
had
been
bred
it
rose
now
suddenly
in
front
of
him
as
he
sauntered
from
patch
to
patch
of
sunlight
under
the
elms
like
some
huge
shadowy
and
symbolic
monument
he
looked
at
it
with
wondering
curiosity
as
at
something
he
had
heard
of
all
his
life
but
never
seen
before
an
abhorrent
spectacle
truly
the
foundations
upon
which
its
dark
bulk
reared
itself
were
ignorance
squalor
brutality
and
vice
pigs
wallowed
in
the
mire
before
its
base
and
burrowing
into
this
base
were
a
myriad
of
narrow
doors
each
bearing
the
hateful
sign
of
a
saloon
and
giving
forth
from
its
recesses
of
night
the
sounds
of
screams
and
curses
above
were
sculptured
rows
of
lowering
faces
from
nast
and
cartoons
and
out
of
these
sprang
into
the
vague
upper
gloom
on
the
one
side
from
which
negroes
hung
by
the
neck
and
on
the
other
gibbets
for
dynamiters
and
molly
maguires
and
between
the
two
glowed
a
spectral
picture
of
some
tonsured
men
with
leering
satanic
masks
making
a
bonfire
of
the
bible
in
the
public
schools
theron
stared
this
phantasm
hard
in
the
face
and
recognized
it
for
a
very
tolerable
embodiment
of
what
he
had
heretofore
supposed
he
thought
about
the
irish
for
an
instant
the
sight
of
it
made
him
shiver
as
if
the
sunny
may
had
of
a
sudden
lapsed
back
into
bleak
december
then
he
smiled
and
the
bad
vision
went
off
into
space
he
saw
instead
father
forbes
in
the
white
and
purple
vestments
standing
by
poor
bedside
with
his
pale
chiselled
luminous
uplifted
face
and
he
heard
only
the
proud
confident
clanging
of
the
girl
recital
beatum
michaelem
archangelum
beatum
joannem
baptistam
petrum
et
paulum
em
am
um
like
strokes
on
a
great
resonant
attuned
for
the
hearing
of
heaven
he
caught
himself
on
the
very
verge
of
feeling
that
heaven
must
have
heard
then
he
smiled
again
and
laid
the
matter
aside
with
a
parting
admission
that
it
had
been
undoubtedly
picturesque
and
impressive
and
that
it
had
been
a
valuable
experience
to
him
to
see
it
at
least
the
irish
with
all
their
faults
must
have
a
poetic
strain
or
they
would
not
have
clung
so
tenaciously
to
those
curious
and
ancient
forms
he
recalled
having
heard
somewhere
or
read
it
might
be
that
they
were
a
people
much
given
to
songs
and
music
and
the
young
lady
that
very
handsome
and
friendly
miss
madden
had
told
him
that
she
was
a
musician
he
had
a
new
pleasure
in
turning
this
over
in
his
mind
of
all
the
closed
doors
which
his
choice
of
a
career
had
left
along
his
pathway
no
other
had
for
him
such
a
magical
fascination
as
that
on
which
was
graven
the
lute
of
orpheus
he
knew
not
even
the
alphabet
of
music
and
his
conceptions
of
its
possibilities
ran
but
little
beyond
the
best
of
the
he
had
heard
at
conferences
yet
none
the
less
the
longing
for
it
raised
on
occasion
such
mutiny
in
his
soul
that
more
than
once
he
had
specifically
prayed
against
it
as
a
temptation
dangerous
though
some
of
its
tendencies
might
be
there
was
no
gainsaying
the
fact
that
a
love
for
music
was
in
the
main
an
uplifting
influence
an
attribute
of
cultivation
the
world
was
the
sweeter
and
more
gentle
for
it
and
this
brought
him
to
musing
upon
the
odd
chance
that
the
two
people
of
octavius
who
had
given
him
the
first
notion
of
polish
and
intellectual
culture
in
the
town
should
be
irish
the
romish
priest
must
have
been
vastly
surprised
at
his
intrusion
yet
had
been
at
the
greatest
pains
to
act
as
if
it
were
quite
the
usual
thing
to
have
methodist
ministers
assist
at
extreme
unction
and
the
young
woman
how
gracefully
with
what
delicacy
had
she
comprehended
his
position
and
robbed
it
of
all
its
possible
embarrassments
it
occurred
to
him
that
they
must
have
passed
there
in
front
of
her
home
the
very
tree
from
which
the
luckless
wheelwright
had
fallen
some
hours
before
and
the
fact
that
she
had
forborne
to
point
it
out
to
him
took
form
in
his
mind
as
an
added
proof
of
her
refinement
of
nature
the
midday
dinner
was
a
little
more
than
ready
when
theron
reached
home
and
let
himself
in
by
the
front
door
on
mondays
owing
to
the
moisture
and
clutter
of
the
weekly
washing
in
the
kitchen
the
table
was
laid
in
the
and
as
he
entered
from
the
hall
the
partner
of
his
joys
bustled
in
by
the
other
door
bearing
the
steaming
platter
of
corned
beef
dumplings
cabbages
and
carrots
with
arms
bared
to
the
elbows
and
a
red
face
it
gave
him
great
comfort
however
to
note
that
there
were
no
signs
of
the
morning
displeasure
remaining
on
this
face
and
he
immediately
remembered
again
those
interrupted
projects
of
his
about
the
piano
and
the
hired
girl
well
i
just
about
begun
to
reckon
that
i
was
a
widow
said
alice
putting
down
her
fragrant
burden
there
was
such
an
obvious
suggestion
of
propitiation
in
her
tone
that
theron
went
around
and
kissed
her
he
thought
of
saying
something
about
keeping
out
of
the
way
because
it
was
blue
monday
but
held
it
back
lest
it
should
sound
like
a
reproach
well
what
kind
of
a
washerwoman
does
this
one
turn
out
to
be
he
asked
after
they
were
seated
and
he
had
invoked
a
blessing
and
was
cutting
vigorously
into
the
meat
oh
replied
alice
she
seems
to
be
particular
but
mortal
slow
if
i
had
stood
right
over
her
we
should
have
had
the
clothes
out
till
goodness
knows
when
and
of
course
she
irish
well
what
of
that
asked
the
minister
with
a
fine
unconcern
alice
looked
up
from
her
plate
with
knife
and
fork
suspended
in
air
why
you
know
we
were
talking
only
the
other
day
of
what
a
pity
it
was
that
none
of
our
own
people
went
out
washing
she
said
that
welsh
woman
we
heard
of
could
come
after
all
and
they
say
too
that
she
presumes
dreadfully
upon
the
acquaintance
being
a
church
member
you
know
so
we
simply
had
to
fall
back
on
the
irish
and
even
if
they
do
go
and
tell
their
priest
everything
they
see
and
hear
why
there
one
comfort
they
can
tell
about
us
and
welcome
of
course
i
see
to
it
she
does
snoop
around
in
theron
smiled
that
all
nonsense
about
their
telling
such
things
to
their
priests
he
said
with
easy
confidence
why
you
told
me
so
yourself
replied
alice
briskly
and
i
always
understood
so
too
they
bound
to
tell
everything
in
confession
that
what
gives
the
catholic
church
such
a
tremendous
hold
spoken
of
it
it
must
have
been
by
way
of
a
figure
of
speech
remarked
theron
not
with
entire
directness
women
are
great
hands
to
separate
observations
from
their
context
and
so
give
them
meanings
quite
unintended
they
are
also
great
hands
he
added
genially
or
at
least
one
of
them
is
at
making
the
most
delicious
dumplings
in
the
world
i
believe
these
are
the
best
even
you
ever
alice
was
not
unmindful
of
the
compliment
but
her
thoughts
were
on
other
things
i
should
like
that
woman
priest
for
example
she
said
to
know
that
we
had
no
but
if
he
comes
and
stands
outside
our
house
every
night
and
listens
as
of
course
he
will
said
theron
with
mock
gravity
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
when
he
must
reach
that
conclusion
for
himself
our
only
chance
however
is
that
there
are
some
sixteen
hundred
other
houses
for
him
to
watch
so
that
he
may
not
get
around
to
us
for
quite
a
spell
why
seriously
alice
what
on
earth
do
you
suppose
father
forbes
knows
or
cares
about
our
poor
little
affairs
or
those
of
any
other
protestant
household
in
this
whole
village
he
has
his
work
to
do
just
as
i
have
mine
only
his
is
ten
times
as
exacting
in
everything
except
sermons
and
you
may
be
sure
he
is
only
too
glad
when
it
is
over
each
day
without
bothering
about
things
that
are
none
of
his
all
the
same
i
afraid
of
them
said
alice
as
if
argument
were
exhausted
chapter
vi
on
the
following
morning
young
ware
anticipated
events
by
inscribing
in
his
diary
for
the
day
immediately
after
breakfast
these
remarks
arranged
about
piano
began
work
upon
the
date
indeed
deserved
to
be
distinguished
from
its
fellows
theron
was
so
conscious
of
its
importance
that
he
not
only
prophesied
in
the
little
diary
which
alice
had
given
him
for
christmas
but
returned
after
he
had
got
out
upon
the
front
steps
of
the
parsonage
to
have
his
hat
brushed
afresh
by
her
wonders
will
never
cease
she
said
jocosely
with
you
getting
particular
about
your
clothes
there
is
anything
in
this
wide
world
that
ca
happen
now
one
does
go
out
to
bring
home
a
piano
every
day
he
made
answer
besides
i
want
to
make
such
an
impression
upon
the
man
that
he
will
deal
gently
with
that
first
cash
payment
down
do
you
know
he
added
watching
her
turn
the
felt
brim
under
the
strokes
thinking
some
of
getting
me
a
regular
silk
why
do
you
then
she
rejoined
but
without
any
ring
of
glad
acquiescence
in
her
tone
he
fancied
that
her
face
lengthened
a
little
and
he
instantly
ascribed
it
to
recollections
of
the
way
in
which
the
roses
had
been
bullied
out
of
her
own
headgear
you
are
quite
sure
now
pet
he
made
haste
to
change
the
subject
that
the
hired
girl
can
wait
just
as
well
as
not
until
fall
oh
my
yes
alice
replied
putting
the
hat
on
his
head
and
smoothing
back
his
hair
behind
his
ears
she
only
be
in
the
way
now
you
see
with
hot
weather
coming
on
there
wo
be
much
cooking
we
take
all
our
meals
out
here
and
that
saves
so
much
work
that
really
what
remains
is
hardly
more
than
taking
care
of
a
and
besides
not
having
her
will
almost
half
pay
for
the
but
when
cold
weather
comes
you
sure
you
consent
he
urged
like
a
shot
she
assured
him
and
after
a
happy
little
caress
he
started
out
again
on
his
momentous
mission
thurston
was
a
place
concerning
which
opinions
differed
in
octavius
that
it
typified
progress
and
helped
more
than
any
other
feature
of
the
village
to
bring
it
up
to
date
no
one
indeed
disputed
one
might
move
about
a
great
deal
in
truth
and
hear
no
other
view
expressed
but
then
again
one
might
stumble
into
conversation
with
one
small
storekeeper
after
another
and
learn
that
they
united
in
resenting
the
existence
of
thurston
as
rival
farmers
might
join
to
curse
a
protracted
drought
each
had
his
special
flaming
grievance
the
little
dealers
asked
mournfully
how
they
could
be
expected
to
compete
with
an
establishment
which
could
buy
bankrupt
stocks
at
a
hundred
different
points
and
make
a
profit
if
only
of
the
articles
were
sold
for
more
than
they
would
cost
from
the
jobber
the
little
boot
and
shoe
dealers
clothiers
hatters
and
furriers
the
small
merchants
in
carpets
crockery
and
furniture
the
venders
of
hardware
and
household
utensils
of
leathern
goods
and
of
musical
instruments
and
even
toys
all
had
the
same
pathetically
unanswerable
question
to
propound
but
mostly
they
put
it
to
themselves
because
the
others
were
at
the
rev
theron
ware
had
entertained
rather
strong
views
on
this
subject
and
that
only
a
week
or
two
ago
one
of
his
first
acquaintances
in
octavius
had
been
the
owner
of
the
principal
in
the
place
a
gentle
and
bald
old
man
who
produced
the
complete
impression
of
a
bibliophile
upon
what
the
slightest
investigation
showed
to
be
only
a
meagre
acquaintance
with
publishers
circulars
but
at
least
he
had
the
air
of
loving
his
business
and
the
young
minister
had
enjoyed
a
long
talk
with
or
rather
at
him
out
of
this
talk
had
come
the
information
that
the
store
was
losing
money
not
even
the
stationery
department
now
showed
a
profit
worth
mentioning
when
octavius
had
contained
only
five
thousand
inhabitants
it
boasted
four
two
of
them
good
ones
now
with
a
population
more
than
doubled
only
these
latter
two
survived
and
they
must
soon
go
to
the
wall
the
reason
it
was
in
a
nutshell
a
book
which
sold
at
retail
for
one
dollar
and
a
half
cost
the
bookseller
ninety
cents
if
it
was
at
all
a
popular
book
thurston
advertised
it
at
cents
and
in
any
case
at
a
profit
of
only
two
or
three
cents
of
course
it
was
done
to
widen
the
patronage
to
bring
people
into
the
store
equally
of
course
it
was
destroying
the
book
business
and
debauching
the
reading
tastes
of
the
community
without
the
profits
from
the
light
and
ephemeral
popular
literature
of
the
season
the
proper
could
not
keep
up
its
stock
of
more
solid
works
and
indeed
could
not
long
keep
open
at
all
on
the
other
hand
thurston
dealt
with
nothing
save
the
demand
of
the
moment
and
offered
only
the
books
which
were
the
talk
of
the
week
thus
in
plain
words
the
book
trade
was
going
to
the
dogs
and
it
was
the
same
with
pretty
nearly
every
other
trade
theron
was
indignant
at
this
and
on
his
return
home
told
alice
that
he
desired
her
to
make
no
purchases
whatever
at
he
even
resolved
to
preach
a
sermon
on
the
subject
of
the
modern
idea
of
admiring
the
great
for
crushing
the
small
and
sketched
out
some
notes
for
it
which
he
thought
solved
the
problem
of
flaying
the
local
abuse
without
mentioning
it
by
name
they
had
lain
on
his
desk
now
for
ten
days
or
more
and
on
only
the
previous
friday
he
had
speculated
upon
using
them
that
coming
sunday
on
this
bright
and
cheerful
tuesday
morning
he
walked
with
a
blithe
step
unhesitatingly
down
the
main
street
to
thurston
and
entered
without
any
show
of
repugnance
the
door
next
to
the
window
wherein
flanked
by
dangling
banjos
and
built
in
pyramids
was
displayed
the
sign
pianos
on
the
instalment
he
was
recognized
by
some
responsible
persons
and
treated
with
distinguished
deference
they
were
charmed
with
the
intelligence
that
he
desired
a
piano
and
fascinated
by
his
wish
to
pay
for
it
only
a
little
at
a
time
they
had
special
terms
for
clergymen
and
made
him
feel
as
if
these
were
being
extended
to
him
on
a
silver
charger
by
kneeling
admirers
it
was
so
easy
to
buy
things
here
that
he
was
a
trifle
disturbed
to
find
his
flowing
course
interrupted
by
his
own
entire
ignorance
as
to
what
kind
of
piano
he
wanted
he
looked
at
all
they
had
in
stock
and
heard
them
played
upon
they
differed
greatly
in
price
and
so
he
fancied
almost
as
much
in
tone
it
discouraged
him
to
note
however
that
several
of
those
he
thought
the
finest
in
tone
were
among
the
very
cheapest
in
the
lot
pondering
this
and
staring
in
hopeless
puzzlement
from
one
to
another
of
the
big
black
shiny
monsters
he
suddenly
thought
of
something
i
would
rather
not
decide
for
myself
he
said
i
know
so
little
about
it
if
you
do
mind
i
will
have
a
friend
of
mine
a
skilled
musician
step
in
and
make
a
selection
i
have
so
much
confidence
in
in
her
he
added
hurriedly
it
will
involve
only
a
day
or
the
next
moment
he
was
sorry
he
had
spoken
what
would
they
think
when
they
saw
the
organist
of
the
catholic
church
come
to
pick
out
a
piano
for
the
methodist
parsonage
and
how
could
he
decorously
prefer
the
request
to
her
to
undertake
this
task
he
might
not
meet
her
again
for
ages
and
to
his
provincial
notions
writing
would
have
seemed
out
of
the
question
and
would
it
not
be
disagreeable
to
have
her
know
that
he
was
buying
a
piano
by
part
payments
poor
alice
dread
of
the
gossip
occurred
to
him
at
this
and
he
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
then
all
at
once
the
difficulty
vanished
of
course
it
would
come
all
right
somehow
everything
did
he
was
on
firmer
ground
buying
the
materials
for
the
new
book
over
on
the
stationery
side
his
original
intention
had
been
to
bestow
this
patronage
upon
the
old
bookseller
but
these
suavely
smart
people
in
thurston
had
had
the
effect
of
putting
him
on
his
honor
when
they
asked
would
there
be
anything
else
and
he
had
followed
them
unresistingly
he
indulged
to
the
full
his
whim
that
everything
entering
into
the
construction
of
abraham
should
be
he
watched
with
his
own
eyes
a
whole
ream
of
broad
glazed
white
paper
being
sliced
down
by
the
cutter
into
single
sheets
and
thrilled
with
a
novel
ecstasy
as
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
spotless
bulk
so
wooingly
did
it
invite
him
to
begin
he
tried
a
score
of
pens
before
the
right
one
came
to
hand
when
a
box
of
these
had
been
laid
aside
with
ink
and
and
a
little
bronze
inkstand
he
made
a
sign
that
the
outfit
was
complete
or
no
there
must
be
some
he
had
always
used
those
given
away
by
insurance
companies
his
congregations
never
failed
to
contain
one
or
more
agents
who
had
these
to
bestow
by
the
armful
but
the
book
deserved
a
virgin
blotter
theron
stood
by
while
all
these
things
were
being
tied
up
together
in
a
parcel
the
suggestion
that
they
should
be
sent
almost
hurt
him
oh
no
he
would
carry
them
home
himself
so
strongly
did
they
appeal
to
his
sanguine
imagination
that
he
could
not
forbear
hinting
to
the
man
who
had
shown
him
the
pianos
and
was
now
accompanying
him
to
the
door
that
this
package
under
his
arm
represented
potentially
the
price
of
the
piano
he
was
going
to
have
he
did
it
in
a
roundabout
way
with
one
of
his
droll
hesitating
smiles
the
man
did
not
understand
at
all
and
theron
had
not
the
temerity
to
repeat
the
remark
he
strode
home
with
the
precious
bundle
as
fast
as
he
could
i
thought
it
best
after
all
not
to
commit
myself
to
a
selection
he
explained
about
the
piano
at
in
such
a
matter
as
this
the
opinion
of
an
expert
is
everything
i
am
going
to
have
one
of
the
principal
musicians
of
the
town
go
and
try
them
all
and
tell
me
which
we
ought
to
and
while
he
about
it
said
alice
you
might
ask
him
to
make
a
little
list
of
some
of
the
new
music
i
got
way
behind
the
times
being
without
a
piano
so
long
tell
him
not
any
very
difficult
pieces
you
yes
i
know
put
in
theron
almost
hastily
and
began
talking
of
other
things
his
conversation
was
of
the
most
rambling
and
desultory
sort
because
all
the
while
the
two
lobes
of
his
brain
as
it
were
kept
up
a
dispute
as
to
whether
alice
ought
to
have
been
told
that
this
principal
musician
was
of
her
own
sex
it
would
certainly
have
been
better
at
the
outset
he
decided
but
to
mention
it
now
would
be
to
invest
the
fact
with
undue
importance
yes
that
was
quite
clear
only
the
clearer
it
became
from
one
point
of
view
the
shadier
it
waxed
from
the
other
the
problem
really
disturbed
the
young
minister
mind
throughout
the
meal
and
his
abstraction
became
so
marked
at
last
that
his
wife
commented
upon
it
a
penny
for
your
thoughts
she
said
with
cheerful
briskness
this
ancient
formula
of
the
had
always
rather
jarred
on
theron
it
presented
itself
now
to
his
mind
as
a
peculiarly
aggravating
banality
i
am
going
to
begin
my
book
this
afternoon
he
remarked
impressively
there
is
a
great
deal
to
think
it
turned
out
that
there
was
even
more
to
think
about
than
he
had
imagined
after
hours
of
solitary
musing
at
his
desk
or
of
pacing
up
and
down
before
his
open
theron
found
the
first
shadows
of
a
twilight
beginning
to
fall
upon
that
beautiful
pile
of
white
paper
still
unstained
by
ink
he
saw
the
book
he
wanted
to
write
before
him
in
his
mental
vision
much
more
distinctly
than
ever
but
the
idea
of
beginning
it
impetuously
and
hurling
it
off
hot
and
glowing
week
by
week
had
faded
away
like
a
dream
this
long
afternoon
spent
face
to
face
with
a
project
born
of
his
own
brain
but
yesterday
yet
already
so
much
bigger
than
himself
was
really
a
most
fruitful
time
for
the
young
clergyman
the
lessons
which
cut
most
deeply
into
our
consciousness
are
those
we
learn
from
our
children
theron
in
this
first
day
contact
with
the
offspring
of
his
fancy
found
revealed
to
him
an
unsuspected
and
staggering
truth
it
was
that
he
was
an
extremely
ignorant
and
rudely
untrained
young
man
whose
pretensions
to
intellectual
authority
among
any
educated
people
would
be
laughed
at
with
deserved
contempt
strangely
enough
after
he
had
weathered
the
first
shock
this
discovery
did
not
dismay
theron
ware
the
very
completeness
of
the
conviction
it
carried
with
it
saturated
his
mind
with
a
feeling
as
if
the
fact
had
really
been
known
to
him
all
along
and
there
came
too
after
a
little
an
almost
pleasurable
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
revelation
he
had
been
merely
drifting
in
fatuous
and
conceited
blindness
now
all
at
once
his
eyes
were
open
he
knew
what
he
had
to
do
ignorance
was
a
thing
to
be
remedied
and
he
would
forthwith
bend
all
his
energies
to
cultivating
his
mind
till
it
should
blossom
like
a
garden
in
this
mood
theron
mentally
measured
himself
against
the
more
conspicuous
of
his
colleagues
in
the
conference
they
also
were
ignorant
clownishly
ignorant
the
difference
was
that
they
were
doomed
by
native
incapacity
to
go
on
all
their
lives
without
ever
finding
it
out
it
was
obvious
to
him
that
his
case
was
better
there
was
bright
promise
in
the
very
fact
that
he
had
discovered
his
shortcomings
he
had
begun
the
afternoon
by
taking
down
from
their
places
the
various
works
in
his
meagre
library
which
bore
more
or
less
relation
to
the
task
in
hand
the
threescore
books
which
constituted
his
printed
possessions
were
almost
wholly
from
the
press
of
the
book
concern
the
few
exceptions
were
volumes
which
though
published
elsewhere
had
come
to
him
through
that
giant
circulating
agency
of
the
general
conference
and
wore
the
stamp
of
its
approval
perhaps
it
was
the
sight
of
these
shelves
which
started
this
day
great
revolution
in
theron
opinions
of
himself
he
had
never
thought
much
before
about
owning
books
he
had
been
too
poor
to
buy
many
and
the
conditions
of
canvassing
about
among
one
parishioners
which
the
thrifty
book
concern
imposes
upon
those
who
would
have
without
buying
had
always
repelled
him
now
suddenly
as
he
moved
along
the
two
shelves
he
felt
ashamed
at
their
beggarly
showing
the
land
and
the
book
in
three
portly
volumes
was
the
most
pretentious
of
the
aids
which
he
finally
culled
from
his
collection
beside
it
he
laid
out
bible
lands
rivers
and
lakes
of
scripture
bible
manners
and
customs
the
genesis
and
exodus
volume
of
commentary
some
old
numbers
of
the
methodist
quarterly
review
and
a
copy
of
josephus
which
had
belonged
to
his
grandmother
and
had
seen
him
through
many
a
weary
sunday
afternoon
in
boyhood
he
glanced
casually
through
these
one
by
one
as
he
took
them
down
and
began
to
fear
that
they
were
not
going
to
be
of
so
much
use
as
he
had
thought
then
seating
himself
he
read
carefully
through
the
thirteen
chapters
of
genesis
which
chronicle
the
story
of
the
founder
of
israel
of
course
he
had
known
this
story
from
his
earliest
years
in
almost
every
chapter
he
came
now
upon
a
phrase
or
an
incident
which
had
served
him
as
the
basis
for
a
sermon
he
had
preached
about
hagar
in
the
wilderness
about
lot
wife
about
the
visit
of
the
angels
about
the
intended
sacrifice
of
isaac
about
a
dozen
other
things
suggested
by
the
ancient
narrative
somehow
this
time
it
all
seemed
different
to
him
the
people
he
read
about
were
altered
to
his
vision
heretofore
a
poetic
light
had
shone
about
them
where
indeed
they
had
not
glowed
in
a
halo
of
sanctification
now
by
some
chance
this
light
was
gone
and
he
saw
them
instead
as
untutored
and
unwashed
barbarians
filled
with
animal
lusts
and
ferocities
struggling
by
violence
and
foul
chicanery
to
secure
a
foothold
in
a
country
which
did
not
belong
to
them
all
rude
tramps
and
robbers
of
the
uncivilized
plain
the
apparent
fact
that
abram
was
a
chaldean
struck
him
with
peculiar
force
how
was
it
he
wondered
that
this
had
never
occurred
to
him
before
examining
himself
he
found
that
he
had
supposed
vaguely
that
there
had
been
jews
from
the
beginning
or
at
least
say
from
the
flood
but
no
abram
was
introduced
simply
as
a
citizen
of
the
chaldean
town
of
ur
and
there
was
no
hint
of
any
difference
in
race
between
him
and
his
neighbors
it
was
specially
mentioned
that
his
brother
father
died
in
ur
the
city
of
his
nativity
evidently
the
family
belonged
there
and
were
chaldeans
like
the
rest
i
do
not
cite
this
as
at
all
a
striking
discovery
but
it
did
have
a
curious
effect
upon
theron
ware
up
to
that
very
afternoon
his
notion
of
the
kind
of
book
he
wanted
to
write
had
been
founded
upon
a
popular
book
called
ruth
the
moabitess
written
by
a
clergyman
he
knew
very
well
the
rev
ray
mifflin
this
model
performance
troubled
itself
not
at
all
with
difficult
points
but
went
swimmingly
along
through
scented
summer
seas
of
pretty
rhetoric
teaching
nothing
it
is
true
but
pleasing
a
good
deal
and
selling
like
hot
cakes
now
all
at
once
theron
felt
that
he
hated
that
sort
of
book
his
work
should
be
of
a
vastly
different
order
he
might
fairly
assume
he
thought
that
if
the
fact
that
abram
was
a
chaldean
was
new
to
him
it
would
fall
upon
the
world
in
general
as
a
novelty
very
well
then
there
was
his
chance
he
would
write
a
learned
book
showing
who
the
chaldeans
were
and
how
their
manners
and
beliefs
differed
from
and
influenced
it
was
at
this
psychological
instant
that
the
wave
of
suddenly
burst
upon
and
submerged
the
young
clergyman
it
passed
again
leaving
him
staring
fixedly
at
the
pile
of
books
he
had
taken
down
from
the
shelves
and
gasping
a
little
as
if
for
breath
then
the
humorous
side
of
the
thing
perversely
enough
appealed
to
him
and
he
grinned
feebly
to
himself
at
the
joke
of
his
having
imagined
that
he
could
write
learnedly
about
the
chaldeans
or
anything
else
but
no
it
remain
a
joke
his
long
mobile
face
grew
serious
under
the
new
resolve
he
would
learn
what
there
was
to
be
learned
about
the
chaldeans
he
rose
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
gathering
fresh
strength
of
purpose
as
this
inviting
field
of
research
spread
out
its
vistas
before
him
perhaps
yes
he
would
incidentally
explore
the
mysteries
of
the
moabitic
past
as
well
and
thus
put
the
rev
ray
mifflin
to
confusion
on
his
own
subject
that
would
in
itself
be
a
useful
thing
because
mifflin
wore
kid
gloves
at
the
conference
and
affected
an
intolerable
superiority
of
dress
and
demeanor
and
there
would
be
general
satisfaction
among
the
plainer
and
worthier
brethren
at
seeing
him
taken
down
a
peg
now
for
the
first
time
there
rose
distinctly
in
theron
mind
that
casual
allusion
which
father
forbes
had
made
to
the
turanians
he
recalled
too
his
momentary
feeling
of
mortification
at
not
knowing
who
the
turanians
were
at
the
time
possibly
if
he
had
probed
this
matter
more
deeply
now
as
he
walked
and
pondered
in
the
little
he
might
have
traced
the
whole
of
the
afternoon
mental
experiences
to
that
chance
remark
of
the
romish
priest
but
this
speculation
did
not
detain
him
he
mused
instead
upon
the
splendid
library
father
forbes
must
have
well
how
does
the
book
come
on
have
you
got
to
lady
yet
it
was
alice
who
spoke
opening
the
door
from
the
kitchen
and
putting
in
her
head
with
a
pretence
of
great
and
solemn
caution
but
with
a
correcting
twinkle
in
her
eyes
i
have
got
to
anybody
yet
answered
theron
absently
these
big
things
must
be
approached
come
out
to
supper
then
while
the
beans
are
hot
said
alice
the
young
minister
sat
through
this
other
meal
again
in
deep
abstraction
his
wife
pursued
her
little
pleasantry
about
keturah
the
second
wife
urging
him
with
mock
gravity
to
scold
her
roundly
for
daring
to
usurp
sarah
place
but
theron
scarcely
heard
her
and
said
next
to
nothing
he
ate
sparingly
and
fidgeted
in
his
seat
waiting
with
obvious
impatience
for
the
finish
of
the
meal
at
last
he
rose
abruptly
i
got
a
call
to
make
something
with
reference
to
the
book
he
said
i
run
out
now
i
think
before
it
gets
he
put
on
his
hat
and
strode
out
of
the
house
as
if
his
errand
was
of
the
utmost
urgency
once
upon
the
street
however
his
pace
slackened
there
was
still
a
good
deal
of
daylight
outside
and
he
loitered
aimlessly
about
walking
with
bowed
head
and
hands
clasped
behind
him
until
dusk
fell
then
he
squared
his
shoulders
and
started
straight
as
the
crow
flies
toward
the
residence
of
father
forbes
chapter
vii
the
new
catholic
church
was
the
largest
and
most
imposing
public
building
in
octavius
even
in
its
unfinished
condition
with
a
bald
roofing
of
boards
marking
on
the
stunted
tower
the
place
where
a
spire
was
to
begin
later
on
it
dwarfed
every
other
edifice
of
the
sort
in
the
town
just
as
it
put
them
all
to
shame
in
the
matter
of
the
throngs
it
drew
rain
or
shine
to
its
services
these
facts
had
not
heretofore
been
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
the
rev
theron
ware
he
had
even
alluded
to
the
subject
in
terms
which
gave
his
wife
the
impression
that
he
actively
deplored
the
strength
and
size
of
the
catholic
denomination
in
this
new
home
of
theirs
and
was
troubled
in
his
mind
about
rome
generally
but
this
evening
he
walked
along
the
extended
side
of
the
big
structure
which
occupied
nearly
half
the
block
and
then
turning
the
corner
passed
in
review
its
looming
front
without
any
hostile
emotions
whatever
in
the
gathering
dusk
it
seemed
more
massive
than
ever
before
but
he
found
himself
only
passively
considering
the
odd
statement
he
had
heard
that
all
catholic
church
property
was
deeded
absolutely
in
the
name
of
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
only
a
narrow
separated
the
church
from
the
pastorate
a
fine
new
brick
residence
standing
flush
upon
the
street
theron
mounted
the
steps
and
looked
about
for
a
search
revealed
instead
a
little
ivory
button
set
in
a
ring
of
metal
work
he
picked
at
this
for
a
time
with
his
before
he
made
out
the
injunction
printed
across
it
to
push
of
course
how
stupid
of
him
this
was
one
of
those
electric
bells
he
had
heard
so
much
of
but
which
had
not
as
yet
made
their
way
to
the
class
of
homes
he
knew
for
custodians
of
a
mediaeval
superstition
and
fanaticism
the
catholic
clergy
seemed
very
much
up
to
date
this
bell
made
him
feel
rather
more
a
countryman
than
ever
the
door
was
opened
by
a
tall
gaunt
woman
who
stood
in
black
relief
against
the
radiance
of
the
while
theron
choosing
his
words
with
some
diffidence
asked
if
the
rev
forbes
was
in
he
is
came
the
answer
he
at
dinner
it
took
the
young
minister
a
second
or
two
to
bring
into
association
in
his
mind
this
evening
hour
and
this
midday
meal
then
he
began
to
say
that
he
would
call
again
it
was
nothing
special
but
the
woman
suddenly
cut
him
short
by
throwing
the
door
wide
open
it
ware
is
it
not
she
asked
in
a
greatly
altered
tone
sure
he
not
have
you
go
away
come
inside
do
sir
i
tell
theron
with
a
dumb
show
of
reluctance
crossed
the
threshold
he
noted
now
that
the
woman
who
had
bustled
down
the
hall
on
her
errand
was
and
incredibly
ugly
with
a
dark
sour
face
glowering
black
eyes
and
a
twisted
mouth
then
he
saw
that
he
was
not
alone
in
the
three
men
and
two
women
all
poorly
clad
and
obviously
working
people
were
seated
in
meek
silence
on
a
bench
beyond
the
they
glanced
up
at
him
for
an
instant
then
resumed
their
patient
study
of
the
linoleum
pattern
on
the
floor
at
their
feet
and
will
you
kindly
step
in
sir
the
elderly
gorgon
had
returned
to
ask
she
led
ware
along
the
to
a
door
near
the
end
and
opened
it
for
him
to
pass
before
her
he
entered
a
room
in
which
for
the
moment
he
could
see
nothing
but
a
central
glare
of
dazzling
light
beating
down
from
a
great
shaded
lamp
upon
a
circular
patch
of
white
table
linen
inside
this
ring
of
illumination
points
of
fire
sparkled
from
silver
and
porcelain
and
two
bars
of
burning
crimson
tracked
across
the
cloth
in
reflection
from
tall
glasses
filled
with
wine
the
rest
of
the
room
was
vague
darkness
but
the
gloom
seemed
saturated
with
novel
aromatic
odors
the
appetizing
scent
of
which
bore
clear
relation
to
what
theron
blinking
eyes
rested
upon
he
was
able
now
to
discern
two
figures
at
the
table
outside
the
glowing
circle
of
the
lamp
they
had
both
risen
and
one
came
toward
him
with
cordial
celerity
holding
out
a
white
plump
hand
in
greeting
he
took
this
proffered
hand
rather
limply
not
wholly
sure
in
the
that
this
really
was
father
forbes
and
began
once
more
that
everlasting
apology
to
which
he
seemed
doomed
in
the
presence
of
the
priest
it
was
broken
abruptly
off
by
the
other
protesting
laughter
my
dear
ware
i
beg
of
you
the
priest
urged
chuckling
with
hospitable
mirth
do
do
apologize
i
give
you
my
word
nothing
in
the
world
could
have
pleased
us
better
than
your
joining
us
here
tonight
it
was
quite
dramatic
your
coming
in
as
you
did
we
were
speaking
of
you
at
that
very
moment
oh
i
forgot
let
me
make
you
acquainted
with
my
friend
my
very
particular
friend
ledsmar
let
me
take
your
hat
pray
draw
up
a
chair
maggie
will
have
a
place
laid
for
you
in
a
oh
i
assure
you
i
could
think
of
it
i
just
eaten
my
my
dinner
expostulated
theron
he
murmured
more
inarticulate
remonstrances
a
moment
later
when
the
grim
old
domestic
appeared
with
plates
serviette
and
tableware
for
his
use
but
she
went
on
spreading
them
before
him
as
if
she
heard
nothing
thus
committed
against
a
decent
show
of
resistance
the
young
minister
did
eat
a
little
here
and
there
of
what
was
set
before
him
and
was
human
enough
to
regret
frankly
that
he
could
not
eat
more
it
seemed
to
him
very
remarkable
cookery
transfiguring
so
simple
a
thing
as
a
steak
for
example
quite
out
of
recognition
and
investing
the
humble
potato
with
a
charm
he
had
never
dreamed
of
he
wondered
from
time
to
time
if
it
would
be
polite
to
ask
how
the
potatoes
were
cooked
so
that
he
might
tell
alice
the
conversation
at
the
table
was
not
continuous
or
even
enlivened
after
the
lapses
into
silence
became
marked
theron
began
to
suspect
that
his
refusal
to
drink
wine
had
annoyed
them
the
more
so
as
he
had
drenched
a
large
section
of
in
his
efforts
to
manipulate
a
siphon
instead
he
was
greatly
relieved
therefore
when
father
forbes
explained
in
an
incidental
way
that
ledsmar
and
he
customarily
ate
their
meals
almost
without
a
word
it
a
philosophic
fad
of
his
the
priest
went
on
smilingly
and
i
have
fallen
in
with
it
for
the
sake
of
a
quiet
life
so
that
when
we
do
have
company
that
is
to
say
once
in
a
blue
moon
we
display
no
manners
to
speak
i
had
always
supposed
that
is
i
always
heard
that
it
was
more
healthful
to
talk
at
meals
said
theron
of
course
what
i
mean
i
took
it
for
granted
all
physicians
thought
ledsmar
laughed
that
depends
so
much
upon
the
quality
of
the
meals
he
remarked
holding
his
glass
up
to
the
light
he
seemed
a
man
of
middle
age
and
an
equable
disposition
theron
stealing
stray
glances
at
him
around
the
lampshade
saw
most
distinctly
of
all
a
broad
impressive
dome
of
skull
which
though
obviously
the
result
of
baldness
gave
the
effect
of
quite
belonging
to
the
face
there
were
spectacles
through
which
shone
now
and
again
the
vivid
sparkle
of
sharp
alert
eyes
and
there
was
a
nose
of
some
sort
not
easy
to
classify
at
once
long
and
thick
the
rest
was
thin
hair
and
short
round
beard
where
the
light
caught
them
but
losing
their
outlines
in
the
shadows
of
the
background
theron
had
not
heard
of
him
among
the
physicians
of
octavius
he
wondered
if
he
might
not
be
a
doctor
of
something
else
than
medicine
and
decided
upon
venturing
the
question
oh
yes
it
is
medicine
replied
ledsmar
i
am
a
doctor
three
or
four
times
over
so
far
as
parchments
can
make
one
in
some
other
respects
though
i
should
think
i
am
probably
less
of
a
doctor
than
anybody
else
now
living
i
have
practised
that
is
regularly
for
many
years
and
i
take
no
interest
whatever
in
keeping
abreast
of
what
the
profession
regards
as
its
progress
i
know
nothing
beyond
what
was
being
taught
in
the
sixties
and
that
i
am
glad
to
say
i
have
mostly
dear
me
said
theron
i
had
always
supposed
that
science
was
the
most
engrossing
of
pursuits
that
once
a
man
took
it
up
he
never
left
but
that
would
imply
a
connection
between
science
and
medicine
commented
the
doctor
my
dear
sir
they
are
not
even
on
speaking
shall
we
go
upstairs
put
in
the
priest
rising
from
his
chair
it
will
be
more
comfortable
to
have
our
coffee
there
unless
indeed
ware
tobacco
is
unpleasant
to
you
oh
my
no
the
young
minister
exclaimed
eager
to
free
himself
from
the
suggestion
of
being
a
i
do
smoke
myself
but
i
am
very
fond
of
the
odor
i
assure
father
forbes
led
the
way
out
it
could
be
seen
now
that
he
wore
a
long
of
black
silk
skilfully
moulded
to
his
erect
shapely
and
rounded
form
though
he
carried
this
with
the
natural
grace
of
a
proud
and
beautiful
belle
there
was
no
hint
of
the
feminine
in
his
bearing
or
in
the
contour
of
his
pale
handsome
face
as
he
moved
through
the
the
five
people
whom
theron
had
seen
waiting
rose
from
their
bench
and
two
of
the
women
began
in
humble
murmurs
if
you
please
father
and
to
your
riverence
but
the
priest
merely
nodded
and
passed
on
up
the
staircase
followed
by
his
guests
the
people
sat
down
on
their
bench
again
a
few
minutes
later
reclining
at
his
ease
in
a
huge
low
chair
and
feeling
himself
unaccountably
at
home
in
the
most
luxuriously
appointed
and
delightful
little
room
he
had
ever
seen
the
rev
theron
ware
sipped
his
unaccustomed
coffee
and
embarked
upon
an
explanation
of
his
errand
somehow
the
very
profusion
of
scholarly
symbols
about
him
the
great
dark
rows
of
encased
and
crowded
rising
to
the
ceiling
the
classical
engravings
upon
the
wall
the
revolving
the
the
mass
of
littered
magazines
reviews
and
papers
at
either
end
of
the
costly
and
elaborate
seemed
to
make
it
the
easier
for
him
to
explain
without
reproach
that
he
needed
information
about
abram
he
told
them
quite
in
detail
the
story
of
his
book
the
two
others
sat
watching
him
through
a
faint
haze
of
scented
smoke
with
polite
encouragement
on
their
faces
father
forbes
took
the
added
trouble
to
nod
understandingly
at
the
various
points
of
the
narrative
and
when
it
was
finished
gave
one
of
his
little
approving
chuckles
this
skirts
very
closely
upon
sorcery
he
said
smilingly
do
you
know
there
is
perhaps
not
another
man
in
the
country
who
knows
assyriology
so
thoroughly
as
our
friend
here
that
putting
it
too
strong
remarked
the
doctor
i
only
follow
at
a
distance
a
year
or
two
behind
but
i
daresay
i
can
help
you
you
are
quite
welcome
to
anything
i
have
my
books
cover
the
ground
pretty
well
up
to
last
year
delitzsch
is
very
interesting
but
baudissin
zur
semitischen
religionsgeschichte
would
come
closer
to
what
you
need
there
are
several
other
important
germans
schrader
bunsen
duncker
hommel
and
so
unluckily
i
i
do
read
german
readily
theron
explained
with
diffidence
that
a
pity
said
the
doctor
because
they
do
the
best
work
not
only
in
this
field
but
in
most
others
and
they
do
so
much
that
the
mass
defies
translation
well
the
best
thing
outside
of
german
of
course
is
sayce
i
daresay
you
know
him
the
rev
ware
shook
his
head
mournfully
i
do
seem
to
know
any
one
he
murmured
the
others
exchanged
glances
but
if
i
may
ask
ware
pursued
the
doctor
regarding
their
guest
with
interest
through
his
spectacles
why
do
you
specially
hit
upon
abraham
he
is
full
of
difficulties
enough
just
now
at
any
rate
to
warn
off
the
bravest
scholar
why
not
take
something
easier
theron
had
recovered
something
of
his
confidence
oh
no
he
said
that
is
just
what
attracts
me
to
abraham
i
like
the
complexities
and
contradictions
in
his
character
take
for
instance
all
that
strange
and
picturesque
episode
of
hagar
see
the
splendid
contrast
between
the
craft
and
commercial
guile
of
his
dealings
in
egypt
and
with
abimelech
and
the
simple
straightforward
godliness
of
his
later
years
no
all
those
difficulties
only
attract
me
do
you
happen
to
know
of
course
you
would
know
do
those
german
books
or
the
others
give
anywhere
any
additional
details
of
the
man
himself
and
his
sayings
and
doings
little
things
which
help
you
know
to
round
out
one
conception
of
the
individual
again
the
priest
and
the
doctor
stole
a
furtive
glance
across
the
young
minister
head
it
was
father
forbes
who
replied
i
fear
that
you
are
taking
our
friend
abraham
too
literally
ware
he
said
in
that
gentle
semblance
of
paternal
tones
which
seemed
to
go
so
well
with
his
gown
modern
research
you
know
quite
wipes
him
out
of
existence
as
an
individual
the
word
is
merely
an
eponym
it
means
father
practically
all
the
names
in
the
genesis
chronologies
are
what
we
call
eponymous
abram
is
not
a
person
at
all
he
is
a
tribe
a
sept
a
clan
in
the
same
way
shem
is
not
intended
for
a
man
it
is
the
name
of
a
great
division
of
the
human
race
heber
is
simply
the
throwing
back
into
allegorical
substance
so
to
speak
of
the
hebrews
heth
of
the
hittites
asshur
of
but
this
is
something
very
new
this
theory
is
it
queried
theron
the
priest
smiled
and
shook
his
head
bless
you
no
my
dear
sir
there
is
nothing
new
epicurus
and
lucretius
outlined
the
whole
darwinian
theory
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
as
for
this
eponym
thing
why
saint
augustine
called
attention
to
it
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
in
his
civitate
dei
he
expressly
says
of
these
genealogical
names
non
homines
that
is
not
persons
it
was
as
obvious
to
him
as
much
a
commonplace
of
knowledge
as
it
was
to
ezekiel
eight
hundred
years
before
it
seems
passing
strange
that
we
should
not
know
it
now
then
commented
theron
i
mean
that
everybody
should
know
father
forbes
gave
a
little
purring
chuckle
ah
there
we
get
upon
contentious
ground
he
remarked
why
should
be
supposed
to
know
anything
at
all
what
business
is
it
of
to
know
things
the
earth
was
just
as
round
in
the
days
when
people
supposed
it
to
be
flat
as
it
is
now
so
the
truth
remains
always
the
truth
even
though
you
give
a
charter
to
ten
hundred
thousand
separate
numskulls
to
examine
it
by
the
light
of
their
private
judgment
and
report
that
it
is
as
many
different
varieties
of
something
else
but
of
course
that
whole
question
of
private
judgment
versus
authority
is
for
us
we
were
speaking
of
yes
said
theron
it
is
very
there
is
a
curious
phase
of
the
subject
which
has
been
worked
out
much
continued
the
priest
probably
the
germans
will
get
at
that
too
sometime
they
are
doing
the
best
irish
work
in
other
fields
as
it
is
i
spoke
of
heber
and
heth
in
genesis
as
meaning
the
hebrews
and
the
hittites
now
my
own
people
the
irish
have
far
more
ancient
legends
and
traditions
than
any
other
nation
west
of
athens
and
you
find
in
their
myth
of
the
milesian
invasion
and
conquest
two
principal
leaders
called
heber
and
ith
or
heth
that
is
supposed
to
be
comparatively
modern
about
the
time
of
solomon
temple
but
these
independent
irish
myths
go
back
to
the
fall
of
the
tower
of
babel
and
they
have
there
an
ancestor
grandson
of
japhet
named
fenius
farsa
and
they
ascribe
to
him
the
invention
of
the
alphabet
they
took
their
ancient
name
of
feine
the
modern
fenian
from
him
oddly
enough
that
is
the
name
which
the
romans
knew
the
phoenicians
by
and
to
them
also
is
ascribed
the
invention
of
the
alphabet
the
irish
have
a
holy
salmon
of
knowledge
just
like
the
chaldean
the
druids
is
identical
with
that
of
the
chaldeans
those
pagan
groves
you
know
which
the
jews
were
always
being
punished
for
building
you
see
there
is
nothing
new
everything
is
built
on
the
ruins
of
something
else
just
as
the
material
earth
is
made
up
of
countless
billions
of
dead
men
bones
so
the
mental
world
is
all
alive
with
the
ghosts
of
dead
men
thoughts
and
beliefs
the
wraiths
of
dead
races
faiths
and
father
forbes
paused
then
added
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
that
peroration
is
from
an
old
sermon
of
mine
in
the
days
when
i
used
to
preach
i
remember
rather
liking
it
at
the
but
you
still
preach
asked
the
rev
ware
with
lifted
brows
no
no
more
i
only
talk
now
and
again
answered
the
priest
with
what
seemed
a
suggestion
of
curtness
he
made
haste
to
take
the
conversation
back
again
the
names
of
these
things
are
singularly
pertinacious
though
they
survive
indefinitely
take
the
modern
name
marmaduke
for
example
it
strikes
one
as
peculiarly
modern
does
it
well
it
is
the
oldest
name
on
earth
thousands
of
years
older
than
adam
it
is
the
ancient
chaldean
meridug
or
merodach
he
was
the
young
god
who
interceded
continually
between
the
angry
omnipotent
ea
his
father
and
the
humble
and
unhappy
damkina
or
earth
who
was
his
mother
this
is
interesting
from
another
point
of
view
because
this
merodach
or
marmaduke
is
so
far
as
we
can
see
now
the
original
prototype
of
our
intermediary
idea
i
daresay
though
that
if
we
could
go
back
still
other
scores
of
centuries
we
should
find
whole
receding
series
of
types
of
this
of
theron
ware
sat
upright
at
the
fall
of
these
words
and
flung
a
swift
startled
look
about
the
room
the
instinctive
glance
of
a
man
unexpectedly
confronted
with
peril
and
casting
desperately
about
for
means
of
defence
and
escape
for
the
instant
his
mind
was
aflame
with
this
vivid
impression
that
he
was
among
sinister
enemies
at
the
mercy
of
criminals
he
half
rose
under
the
impelling
stress
of
this
feeling
with
the
sweat
standing
on
his
brow
and
his
jaw
dropped
in
a
scared
and
bewildered
stare
then
quite
as
suddenly
the
sense
of
shock
was
gone
and
it
was
as
if
nothing
at
all
had
happened
he
drew
a
long
breath
took
another
sip
of
his
coffee
and
found
himself
all
at
once
reflecting
almost
pleasurably
upon
the
charm
of
contact
with
really
educated
people
he
leaned
back
in
the
big
chair
again
and
smiled
to
show
these
men
of
the
world
how
much
at
his
ease
he
was
it
required
an
effort
he
discovered
but
he
made
it
bravely
and
hoped
he
was
succeeding
it
has
been
in
my
power
to
at
all
lay
hold
of
what
the
world
keeps
on
learning
nowadays
about
its
babyhood
he
said
all
i
have
done
is
to
try
to
preserve
an
open
mind
and
to
maintain
my
faith
that
the
more
we
know
the
nearer
we
shall
approach
the
ledsmar
abruptly
scuffled
his
feet
on
the
floor
and
took
out
his
watch
i
afraid
he
began
no
no
there
plenty
of
time
remarked
the
priest
with
his
soft
and
purring
tones
you
finish
your
cigar
here
with
ware
and
excuse
me
while
i
run
down
and
get
rid
of
the
people
in
the
father
forbes
tossed
his
into
the
fender
then
he
took
from
the
mantel
a
strange
cap
with
a
dangling
silk
tassel
at
the
side
put
it
on
his
head
and
went
out
theron
being
left
alone
with
the
doctor
hardly
knew
what
to
do
or
say
he
took
up
a
paper
from
the
floor
beside
him
but
realized
that
it
would
be
impolite
to
go
farther
and
laid
it
on
his
knee
some
trace
of
that
earlier
momentary
feeling
that
he
was
in
hostile
hands
came
back
and
worried
him
he
lifted
himself
upright
in
the
chair
and
then
became
conscious
that
what
really
disturbed
him
was
the
fact
that
ledsmar
had
turned
in
his
seat
crossed
his
legs
and
was
contemplating
him
with
a
gravely
concentrated
scrutiny
through
his
spectacles
this
uncomfortable
gaze
kept
itself
up
a
long
way
beyond
the
point
of
good
manners
but
the
doctor
seemed
not
to
mind
that
at
all
chapter
viii
when
ledsmar
finally
spoke
it
was
in
a
kindlier
tone
than
the
young
minister
had
looked
for
i
had
half
a
notion
of
going
to
hear
you
preach
the
other
evening
he
said
but
at
the
last
minute
i
backed
out
i
daresay
i
shall
pluck
up
the
courage
sooner
or
later
and
really
go
it
must
be
fully
twenty
years
since
i
last
heard
a
sermon
and
i
had
supposed
that
that
would
suffice
for
the
rest
of
my
life
but
they
tell
me
that
you
are
worth
while
and
for
some
reason
or
other
i
find
myself
curious
on
the
involved
and
dubious
though
the
compliment
might
be
theron
felt
himself
flushing
with
satisfaction
he
nodded
his
acknowledgment
and
changed
the
topic
i
was
surprised
to
hear
father
forbes
say
that
he
did
not
preach
he
remarked
why
should
he
asked
the
doctor
indifferently
i
suppose
he
more
than
fifteen
parishioners
in
a
thousand
who
would
understand
him
if
he
did
and
of
these
probably
twelve
would
join
in
a
complaint
to
his
bishop
about
the
heterodox
tone
of
his
sermon
there
is
no
point
in
his
going
to
all
that
pains
merely
to
incur
that
risk
nobody
wants
him
to
preach
and
he
has
reached
an
age
where
personal
vanity
no
longer
tempts
him
to
do
so
what
is
wanted
of
him
is
that
he
should
be
the
paternal
ceremonial
authoritative
head
and
centre
of
his
flock
adviser
monitor
overseer
elder
brother
friend
patron
seigneur
whatever
you
like
everything
except
a
bore
they
draw
the
line
at
that
you
see
how
diametrically
opposed
this
catholic
point
of
view
is
to
the
the
difference
does
seem
extremely
curious
to
me
said
theron
now
those
people
in
the
hall
go
on
put
in
the
doctor
as
the
other
faltered
hesitatingly
i
know
what
you
were
going
to
say
it
struck
you
as
odd
that
he
should
let
them
wait
on
the
bench
there
while
he
came
up
here
to
theron
smiled
faintly
i
was
thinking
that
my
my
parishioners
have
taken
it
so
quietly
but
of
course
it
is
all
so
different
as
chalk
from
cheese
said
ledsmar
lighting
a
fresh
cigar
i
daresay
every
one
you
saw
there
had
come
either
to
take
the
pledge
or
see
to
it
that
one
of
the
others
took
it
that
is
the
chief
industry
in
the
hall
so
far
as
i
have
observed
now
discipline
is
an
important
element
in
the
machinery
here
coming
to
take
the
pledge
implies
that
you
have
been
drunk
and
are
now
ashamed
both
states
have
their
values
but
they
are
opposed
sitting
on
that
bench
tends
to
develop
penitence
to
the
prejudice
of
alcoholism
but
at
no
stage
would
it
ever
occur
to
the
occupant
of
the
bench
that
he
was
the
best
judge
of
how
long
he
was
to
sit
there
or
that
his
priest
should
interrupt
his
dinner
or
general
personal
routine
in
order
to
administer
that
pledge
now
i
daresay
you
have
no
people
at
all
coming
to
off
the
rev
ware
shook
his
head
no
if
a
man
with
us
got
as
bad
as
all
that
he
would
come
near
the
church
at
all
he
simply
drop
out
and
there
would
be
an
end
to
quite
so
interjected
the
doctor
that
is
the
voluntary
system
but
these
fellows
ca
drop
out
there
no
bottom
to
the
catholic
church
everything
that
in
stays
in
if
you
do
mind
my
saying
so
of
course
i
view
you
all
impartially
from
the
outside
but
it
seems
logical
to
me
that
a
church
should
exist
for
those
who
need
its
help
and
not
for
those
who
by
their
own
profession
are
so
good
already
that
it
is
they
who
help
the
church
now
you
turn
a
man
out
of
your
church
who
behaves
badly
that
must
be
on
the
theory
that
his
remaining
in
would
injure
the
church
and
that
in
turn
involves
the
idea
that
it
is
the
excellent
character
of
the
parishioners
which
imparts
virtue
to
the
church
the
catholics
conception
you
see
is
quite
the
converse
such
virtue
as
they
keep
in
stock
is
on
tap
so
to
speak
here
in
the
church
itself
and
the
parishioners
come
and
get
some
for
themselves
according
to
their
need
for
it
some
come
every
day
some
only
once
a
year
some
perhaps
never
between
their
baptism
and
their
funeral
but
they
all
have
a
right
here
the
professional
burglar
every
whit
as
much
as
the
speckless
saint
the
only
stipulation
is
that
they
ought
to
come
under
false
pretences
the
burglar
is
in
honor
bound
not
to
pass
himself
off
to
his
priest
as
the
saint
but
that
is
merely
a
moral
obligation
established
in
the
burglar
own
interest
it
does
him
no
good
to
come
unless
he
feels
that
he
is
playing
the
rules
of
the
game
and
one
of
these
is
confession
if
he
cheats
there
he
knows
that
he
is
cheating
nobody
but
himself
and
might
much
better
have
stopped
away
theron
nodded
his
head
comprehendingly
he
had
a
great
many
views
about
the
romanish
rite
of
confession
which
did
not
at
all
square
with
this
statement
of
the
case
but
this
did
not
seem
a
specially
fit
time
for
bringing
them
forth
there
was
indeed
a
sense
of
languid
repletion
in
his
mind
as
if
it
had
been
overfed
and
wanted
to
lie
down
for
awhile
he
contented
himself
with
nodding
again
and
murmuring
reflectively
yes
it
is
all
strangely
his
tone
was
an
invitation
to
silence
and
the
doctor
turned
his
attention
to
the
cigar
studying
its
ash
for
a
minute
with
an
air
of
deep
meditation
and
then
solemnly
blowing
out
a
slow
series
of
theron
watched
him
with
an
indolent
placid
eye
wondering
lazily
if
it
was
after
all
so
very
pleasant
to
smoke
there
fell
upon
this
silence
with
a
softness
so
delicate
that
it
came
almost
like
a
progression
in
the
hush
the
sound
of
sweet
music
for
a
little
strain
and
source
were
alike
indefinite
an
impalpable
setting
to
harmony
of
the
mellowed
light
the
perfumed
opalescence
of
the
air
the
luxury
and
charm
of
the
room
then
it
rose
as
by
a
sweeping
curve
of
beauty
into
a
firm
calm
severe
melody
delicious
to
the
ear
but
as
cold
in
the
mind
vision
as
moonlit
sculpture
it
went
on
upward
with
stately
collectedness
of
power
till
the
atmosphere
seemed
all
alive
with
the
trembling
consciousness
of
the
presence
of
lofty
souls
sternly
pure
and
pitilessly
great
theron
found
himself
moved
as
he
had
never
been
before
he
almost
resented
the
discovery
when
it
was
presented
to
him
by
the
prosaic
mechanical
side
of
his
brain
that
he
was
listening
to
and
that
it
came
through
the
open
window
from
the
church
close
by
he
would
fain
have
reclined
in
his
chair
and
closed
his
eyes
and
saturated
himself
with
the
uttermost
fulness
of
the
sensation
yet
in
absurd
despite
of
himself
he
rose
and
moved
over
to
the
window
only
a
narrow
alley
separated
the
pastorate
from
the
church
ware
could
have
touched
with
a
the
opposite
wall
indirectly
facing
him
was
the
arched
and
mullioned
top
of
a
great
window
a
dim
light
from
within
shone
through
the
more
translucent
portions
of
the
glass
below
throwing
out
faint
little
bars
of
radiance
upon
the
blackness
of
the
deep
he
could
vaguely
trace
by
these
the
outlines
of
some
sort
of
picture
on
the
window
there
were
human
figures
in
it
and
yes
up
here
in
the
centre
nearest
him
was
a
woman
head
there
was
a
halo
about
it
engirdling
rich
flowing
waves
of
reddish
hair
the
lights
in
which
glowed
like
flame
the
face
itself
was
barely
distinguishable
but
its
form
raised
a
curious
sense
of
resemblance
to
some
other
face
he
looked
at
it
closely
blankly
the
noble
music
throbbing
through
his
brain
meanwhile
it
that
madden
girl
he
suddenly
heard
a
voice
say
by
his
side
ledsmar
had
followed
him
to
the
window
and
was
close
at
his
shoulder
theron
thoughts
were
upon
the
puzzling
shadowed
lineaments
on
the
stained
glass
he
saw
now
in
a
flash
the
resemblance
which
had
baffled
him
it
is
like
her
of
course
he
said
yes
unfortunately
it
is
just
like
her
replied
the
doctor
with
a
hostile
note
in
his
voice
whenever
i
am
dining
here
she
always
goes
in
and
kicks
up
that
racket
she
knows
i
hate
oh
you
mean
that
it
is
she
who
is
playing
remarked
theron
i
thought
you
referred
to
at
least
i
was
thinking
of
his
sentence
died
off
in
inconsequence
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
did
not
want
to
talk
with
the
doctor
about
the
likeness
the
music
had
sunk
away
now
into
fragmentary
and
unconnected
passages
broken
here
and
there
by
abrupt
stops
ledsmar
stretched
an
arm
out
past
him
and
shut
the
window
let
hear
as
little
of
the
row
as
we
can
he
said
and
the
two
went
back
to
their
chairs
pardon
me
for
the
question
the
rev
ware
said
after
a
pause
which
began
to
affect
him
as
constrained
but
something
you
said
about
dining
you
do
live
here
then
in
the
house
i
mean
the
doctor
laughed
a
characteristically
abrupt
dry
little
laugh
which
struck
theron
at
once
as
bearing
a
sort
of
relationship
to
the
priest
habitual
chuckle
that
must
have
been
puzzling
you
no
end
he
said
that
notion
that
the
pastorate
kept
a
devil
advocate
on
the
premises
no
ware
i
do
live
here
i
inhabit
a
house
of
my
own
you
may
have
seen
it
an
place
up
beyond
the
with
a
sort
of
tower
at
the
back
and
a
big
garden
but
i
dine
here
three
or
four
times
a
week
it
is
an
old
arrangement
of
ours
vincent
and
i
have
been
friends
for
many
years
now
we
are
quite
alone
in
the
world
we
two
much
to
our
mutual
satisfaction
you
must
come
up
and
see
me
some
time
come
up
and
have
a
look
over
the
books
we
were
speaking
i
am
much
obliged
said
theron
without
enthusiasm
the
thought
of
the
doctor
by
himself
did
not
attract
him
greatly
the
reservation
in
his
tone
seemed
to
interest
the
doctor
i
suppose
you
are
the
first
man
i
have
asked
in
a
dozen
years
he
remarked
frankly
willing
that
the
young
minister
should
appreciate
the
favor
extended
him
it
must
be
fully
that
since
anybody
but
vincent
forbes
has
been
under
my
roof
that
is
of
my
own
species
i
you
live
there
quite
alone
commented
theron
quite
with
my
dogs
and
cats
and
lizards
and
my
chinaman
i
forget
the
doctor
noted
the
inquiry
in
the
other
lifted
brows
and
smilingly
explained
he
is
my
solitary
servant
possibly
he
might
not
appeal
to
you
much
but
i
can
assure
you
he
used
to
interest
octavius
a
great
deal
when
i
first
brought
him
here
ten
years
ago
or
so
he
afforded
occupation
for
all
the
idle
boys
in
the
village
for
a
at
least
they
used
to
lie
in
wait
for
him
all
day
long
with
stones
or
or
snowballs
according
to
the
season
the
irishmen
from
the
nearly
killed
him
once
or
twice
but
he
patiently
lived
it
all
down
the
chinaman
has
the
patience
to
live
everything
down
the
caucasian
races
included
he
will
see
us
all
to
bed
will
that
gentleman
with
the
pigtail
the
music
over
in
the
church
had
lifted
itself
again
into
form
and
sequence
and
defied
the
closed
window
if
anything
it
was
louder
than
before
and
the
sonorous
roar
of
the
seemed
to
be
shaking
the
very
walls
it
was
something
with
a
exultant
triumphing
swing
in
it
something
which
ought
to
have
been
sung
on
the
battlefield
at
the
close
of
day
by
the
whole
jubilant
army
of
victors
it
was
impossible
to
pretend
not
to
be
listening
to
it
but
the
doctor
submitted
with
an
obvious
scowl
and
bit
off
the
tip
of
his
third
cigar
with
an
annoyed
air
you
do
seem
to
care
much
for
music
suggested
ware
when
a
lull
came
ledsmar
looked
up
lighted
match
in
hand
say
musicians
he
growled
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
he
went
on
between
puffs
at
the
flame
that
the
only
animals
who
make
the
noises
we
call
music
are
of
the
bird
family
a
debased
offshoot
of
the
reptilian
creation
the
very
lowest
types
of
the
vertebrata
now
in
existence
i
insist
upon
the
parallel
among
humans
i
have
in
my
time
sir
had
considerable
opportunities
for
studying
close
at
hand
the
various
orders
of
mammalia
who
devote
themselves
to
what
they
describe
as
the
arts
it
may
sound
a
harsh
judgement
but
i
am
convinced
that
musicians
stand
on
the
very
bottom
rung
of
the
ladder
in
the
of
human
intelligence
even
lower
than
painters
and
this
seemed
such
unqualified
nonsense
to
the
rev
ware
that
he
offered
no
comment
whatever
upon
it
he
tried
instead
to
divert
his
thoughts
to
the
stormy
strains
which
rolled
in
through
the
vibrating
brickwork
and
to
picture
to
himself
the
large
capable
figure
of
miss
madden
seated
in
the
at
the
swaying
to
and
fro
in
a
splendid
ecstasy
of
power
as
she
evoked
at
will
this
superb
and
ordered
uproar
but
the
doctor
broke
insistently
in
upon
his
musings
all
art
is
decay
he
said
raising
his
voice
when
a
race
begins
to
brood
on
the
beautiful
it
is
a
sign
of
rot
of
getting
ready
to
fall
from
the
tree
take
the
jews
those
marvellous
old
fellows
who
were
never
more
than
a
handful
yet
have
imposed
the
rule
of
their
ideas
and
their
gods
upon
us
for
fifteen
hundred
years
why
they
were
forbidden
by
their
most
fundamental
law
to
make
sculptures
or
pictures
that
was
at
a
time
when
the
egyptians
when
the
assyrians
and
other
semites
were
running
to
artistic
riot
every
great
museum
in
the
world
now
has
whole
floors
devoted
to
statues
from
the
nile
and
marvellous
carvings
from
the
palaces
of
sargon
and
assurbanipal
you
can
get
the
artistic
remains
of
the
jews
during
that
whole
period
into
a
child
wheelbarrow
they
had
the
sense
and
strength
to
penalize
art
they
alone
survived
they
saw
the
egyptians
go
the
assyrians
go
the
greeks
go
the
late
romans
go
the
moors
in
spain
go
all
the
artistic
peoples
perish
they
remained
triumphing
over
all
now
at
last
their
apogee
is
here
their
decline
is
at
hand
i
am
told
that
in
this
present
generation
in
europe
the
jews
are
producing
a
great
lot
of
young
painters
and
sculptors
and
actors
just
as
for
a
century
they
have
been
producing
famous
composers
and
musicians
that
means
the
end
of
the
jews
what
have
you
only
got
as
far
as
that
came
the
welcome
interruption
of
a
cheery
voice
father
forbes
had
entered
the
room
and
stood
looking
down
with
a
whimsical
twinkle
in
his
eye
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
guests
you
must
have
been
taken
over
the
ground
at
a
very
slow
pace
ware
he
continued
chuckling
softly
to
have
arrived
merely
at
the
collapse
of
the
new
jerusalem
i
fancied
i
had
given
him
time
enough
to
bring
you
straight
up
to
the
end
of
all
of
us
with
that
chinaman
of
his
gently
slapping
our
graves
with
his
pigtail
that
where
the
doctor
always
winds
up
if
he
allowed
to
run
his
it
has
all
been
very
interesting
extremely
so
i
assure
you
faltered
theron
it
had
become
suddenly
apparent
to
him
that
he
desired
nothing
so
much
as
to
make
his
escape
that
he
had
indeed
only
been
waiting
for
the
host
return
to
do
so
he
rose
at
this
and
explained
that
he
must
be
going
no
special
effort
being
put
forth
to
restrain
him
he
presently
made
his
way
out
father
forbes
hospitably
following
him
down
to
the
door
and
putting
a
very
gracious
cordiality
into
his
adieux
the
night
was
warm
and
black
theron
stood
still
in
it
the
moment
the
pastorate
door
had
closed
the
sudden
darkness
was
so
thick
that
it
was
as
if
he
had
closed
his
eyes
his
dominant
sensation
was
of
a
deep
relief
and
rest
after
some
undue
fatigue
it
crossed
his
mind
that
drunken
men
probably
felt
like
that
as
they
leaned
against
things
on
their
way
home
he
was
affected
himself
he
saw
by
the
weariness
and
following
a
mental
intoxication
the
conceit
pleased
him
and
he
smiled
to
himself
as
he
turned
and
took
the
first
homeward
steps
it
must
be
growing
late
he
thought
alice
would
be
wondering
as
she
waited
there
was
a
street
lamp
at
the
corner
and
as
he
walked
toward
it
he
noted
all
at
once
that
his
feet
were
keeping
step
to
the
movement
of
the
music
proceeding
from
the
organ
within
the
church
a
vaguely
processional
air
marked
enough
in
measure
but
still
with
a
dreamy
effect
it
became
a
pleasure
to
identify
his
progress
with
the
quaint
rhythm
of
sound
as
he
sauntered
along
he
discovered
as
he
neared
the
light
that
he
was
instinctively
stepping
over
the
seams
in
the
flagstone
sidewalk
as
he
had
done
as
a
boy
he
smiled
again
at
this
there
was
something
exceptionally
juvenile
and
buoyant
about
his
mood
now
that
he
examined
it
he
set
it
down
as
a
reaction
from
that
extravagant
and
incendiary
talk
one
thing
was
certain
he
would
never
be
caught
up
at
that
house
beyond
the
with
its
reptiles
and
its
chinaman
should
he
ever
even
go
to
the
pastorate
again
he
decided
not
to
quite
definitely
answer
that
in
the
negative
but
as
he
felt
now
the
chances
were
all
against
it
turning
the
corner
and
walking
off
into
the
shadows
along
the
side
of
the
huge
church
building
theron
noted
almost
at
the
end
of
the
edifice
a
small
door
the
entrance
to
a
porch
coming
out
to
the
sidewalk
which
stood
wide
open
a
thin
pale
vertical
line
of
light
showed
that
the
inner
door
too
was
ajar
through
this
wee
aperture
the
reduced
and
mellowed
by
distance
came
to
him
again
with
that
same
curious
intimate
personal
relation
which
had
so
moved
him
at
the
start
before
the
doctor
closed
the
window
it
was
as
if
it
was
being
played
for
him
alone
he
paused
for
a
doubting
minute
or
two
with
bowed
head
listening
to
the
exquisite
harmony
which
floated
out
to
caress
and
soothe
and
enfold
him
there
was
no
spiritual
or
at
least
pious
effect
in
it
now
he
fancied
that
it
must
be
secular
music
or
if
not
then
something
adapted
to
marriage
ceremonies
rich
vivid
passionate
a
celebration
of
beauty
and
the
glory
of
possession
with
its
ruling
note
of
joy
only
heightened
by
soft
wooing
interludes
and
here
and
there
the
tremor
of
a
fond
timid
little
sob
theron
turned
away
irresolutely
half
frightened
at
the
impression
this
music
was
making
upon
him
then
all
at
once
he
wheeled
and
stepped
boldly
into
the
porch
pushing
the
inner
door
open
and
hearing
it
rustle
against
its
leathern
frame
as
it
swung
to
behind
him
he
had
never
been
inside
a
catholic
church
before
chapter
ix
jeremiah
madden
was
supposed
to
be
probably
the
richest
man
in
octavius
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
about
his
being
its
least
pretentious
citizen
the
huge
and
ornate
modern
mansion
which
he
had
built
putting
to
shame
every
other
house
in
the
place
gave
an
effect
of
ostentation
to
the
maddens
as
a
family
it
seemed
only
to
accentuate
the
air
of
humility
which
enveloped
jeremiah
as
with
a
garment
everybody
knew
some
version
of
the
many
tales
afloat
which
in
a
kindly
spirit
illustrated
the
incongruity
between
him
and
his
splendid
habitation
some
had
it
that
he
slept
in
the
shed
others
told
whimsical
stories
of
his
sitting
alone
in
the
kitchen
evenings
smoking
his
old
clay
pipe
and
sorrowing
because
the
second
madden
would
not
suffer
the
pigs
and
chickens
to
come
in
and
bear
him
company
but
no
matter
how
comic
the
exaggeration
these
legends
were
invariably
amiable
it
lay
in
no
man
mouth
to
speak
harshly
of
jeremiah
madden
he
had
been
born
a
connemara
peasant
and
he
would
die
one
when
he
was
ten
years
old
he
had
seen
some
of
his
own
family
and
most
of
his
neighbors
starve
to
death
he
could
remember
looking
at
the
stiffened
figure
of
a
woman
stretched
on
the
stones
by
the
roadside
with
the
green
stain
of
nettles
on
her
white
lips
a
girl
five
years
or
so
older
than
himself
also
a
madden
and
distantly
related
had
started
in
despair
off
across
the
mountains
to
the
town
where
it
was
said
the
officers
were
dealing
out
food
he
could
recall
her
coming
back
next
day
with
hunger
and
the
fever
the
officers
had
refused
her
relief
because
her
bare
legs
were
not
wholly
shrunken
to
the
bone
while
there
a
calf
on
the
shank
there
no
starvation
they
had
explained
to
her
the
girl
died
without
profiting
by
this
official
apothegm
the
boy
found
it
burned
ineffaceably
upon
his
brain
now
after
a
lapse
of
more
than
forty
years
it
seemed
the
thing
that
he
remembered
best
about
ireland
he
had
drifted
westward
as
an
unconsidered
unresisting
item
in
that
vast
flight
of
the
famine
years
others
whom
he
rubbed
against
in
that
melancholy
exodus
and
deemed
of
much
greater
promise
than
himself
had
done
badly
somehow
he
did
well
he
learned
the
wheelwright
trade
and
really
that
seemed
all
there
was
to
tell
the
rest
had
been
calm
and
sequent
progression
steady
employment
as
a
journeyman
first
then
marriage
and
a
house
and
lot
the
modest
start
as
a
master
the
move
to
octavius
and
cheap
lumber
the
growth
of
his
business
always
marked
of
late
years
stupendous
all
following
naturally
easily
one
thing
out
of
another
jeremiah
encountered
the
idea
among
his
fellows
now
and
again
that
he
was
entitled
to
feel
proud
of
all
this
he
smiled
to
himself
at
the
thought
and
then
sent
a
sigh
after
the
smile
what
was
it
all
but
empty
and
transient
vanity
the
score
of
other
connemara
boys
he
had
known
none
very
fortunate
several
broken
tragically
in
prison
or
the
gutter
nearly
all
now
gone
the
way
of
flesh
were
as
good
as
he
he
could
not
have
it
in
his
heart
to
take
credit
for
his
success
it
would
have
been
like
sneering
over
their
poor
graves
jeremiah
madden
was
now
a
little
man
of
a
reddened
skin
and
a
meditative
almost
saddened
aspect
he
had
blue
eyes
but
his
scanty
hair
showed
raven
black
in
its
shadows
the
width
and
prominence
of
his
dominated
all
recollections
of
his
face
the
long
vertical
and
irregular
teeth
made
in
repose
an
unshapely
mouth
its
smile
though
sweetened
the
whole
countenance
he
wore
a
fringe
of
stiff
beard
passing
from
ear
to
ear
under
his
chin
his
clothes
were
as
simple
as
his
workaday
manners
fitting
his
short
black
pipe
and
his
steadfast
devotion
to
his
business
on
sundays
he
dressed
with
a
certain
rigor
of
respectability
all
in
black
and
laid
aside
tobacco
at
least
to
the
public
view
he
never
missed
going
to
the
early
low
mass
quite
alone
his
family
always
came
later
at
the
ten
high
mass
there
had
been
at
one
time
or
another
a
good
many
members
of
this
family
two
wives
had
borne
jeremiah
madden
a
total
of
over
a
dozen
children
of
these
there
survived
now
only
two
of
the
first
madden
offspring
michael
and
celia
and
a
son
of
the
present
wife
who
had
been
baptized
terence
but
called
himself
theodore
this
minority
of
the
family
inhabited
the
great
new
house
on
main
street
jeremiah
went
every
sunday
afternoon
by
himself
to
kneel
in
the
presence
of
the
majority
there
where
they
lay
in
saint
agnes
consecrated
ground
if
the
weather
was
good
he
generally
extended
his
walk
through
the
fields
to
an
old
deserted
catholic
which
had
been
used
only
in
the
first
years
after
the
famine
invasion
and
now
was
clean
forgotten
the
old
liked
to
look
over
the
primitive
neglected
stones
which
marked
the
graves
of
these
earlier
exiles
fully
half
of
the
inscriptions
mentioned
his
county
galway
there
were
two
naming
the
very
parish
adjoining
his
the
latest
date
on
any
stone
was
of
the
remoter
they
had
all
been
stricken
down
here
in
this
strange
land
with
its
bitter
winters
while
the
memory
of
their
own
soft
humid
gentle
air
was
fresh
within
them
musing
upon
the
clumsy
sculpture
with
its
or
pray
for
the
soul
of
half
to
be
guessed
under
the
stain
and
moss
of
a
generation
there
would
seem
to
him
but
a
step
from
this
present
to
that
awful
past
what
had
happened
between
was
a
meaningless
vision
as
impersonal
as
the
passing
of
the
planets
overhead
he
rarely
had
an
impulse
to
tears
in
the
new
cemetery
where
his
ten
children
were
he
never
left
this
forsaken
old
one
must
not
construct
from
all
this
the
image
of
a
melancholy
man
as
his
fellows
met
and
knew
him
madden
kept
his
griefs
racial
and
individual
for
his
own
use
to
the
men
about
him
in
the
offices
and
the
shops
he
presented
day
after
day
year
after
year
an
imperturbable
cheeriness
of
demeanor
he
had
been
always
fortunate
in
the
selection
of
lieutenants
and
chief
helpers
two
of
these
had
grown
now
into
partners
and
were
almost
as
much
a
part
of
the
big
enterprise
as
jeremiah
himself
they
spoke
often
of
their
inability
to
remember
any
unjust
or
petulant
word
of
his
much
less
any
unworthy
deed
once
they
had
seen
him
in
a
great
rage
all
the
more
impressive
because
he
said
next
to
nothing
a
thoughtless
fellow
told
a
dirty
story
in
the
presence
of
some
apprentices
and
madden
listening
to
this
drove
the
offender
implacably
from
his
employ
it
was
years
now
since
any
one
who
knew
him
had
ventured
upon
lewd
pleasantries
in
his
hearing
jokes
of
the
sort
which
women
might
hear
he
was
very
fond
of
though
he
had
not
much
humor
of
his
own
of
books
he
knew
nothing
whatever
and
he
made
only
the
most
perfunctory
pretence
now
and
again
of
reading
the
newspapers
the
elder
son
michael
was
very
like
his
father
diligent
unassuming
kindly
and
simple
a
plain
tall
thin
red
man
of
nearly
thirty
who
toiled
in
paper
cap
and
as
the
superintendent
in
the
and
put
on
no
airs
whatever
as
the
son
of
the
master
if
there
was
surprise
felt
at
his
not
being
taken
into
the
firm
as
a
partner
he
gave
no
hint
of
sharing
it
he
attended
to
his
religious
duties
with
great
zeal
and
was
president
of
the
sodality
as
a
matter
of
course
this
was
regarded
as
his
blind
side
and
young
employees
who
cultivated
it
and
made
broad
their
phylacteries
under
his
notice
certainly
had
an
added
chance
of
getting
on
well
in
the
works
to
some
few
whom
he
knew
specially
well
michael
would
confess
that
if
he
had
had
the
brains
for
it
he
should
have
wished
to
be
a
priest
he
displayed
no
inclination
to
marry
the
other
son
terence
was
some
eight
years
younger
and
seemed
the
product
of
a
wholly
different
race
the
contrast
between
michael
sandy
skin
and
long
gaunt
visage
and
this
dark
boy
handsome
rounded
face
with
its
prettily
curling
black
hair
large
heavily
fringed
brown
eyes
and
delicately
modelled
features
was
not
more
obvious
than
their
temperamental
separation
this
second
lad
had
been
away
for
years
at
school
indeed
at
a
good
many
schools
for
no
one
seemed
to
manage
to
keep
him
long
he
had
been
with
the
jesuits
at
georgetown
with
the
christian
brothers
at
manhattan
the
sectarian
mt
mary
and
the
severely
secular
annapolis
had
both
been
tried
and
proved
misfits
the
young
man
was
home
again
now
and
save
that
his
name
had
become
theodore
he
appeared
in
no
wise
changed
from
the
beautiful
wilful
bold
and
showy
boy
who
had
gone
away
in
his
teens
he
was
still
rather
small
for
his
years
but
so
gracefully
moulded
in
form
and
so
perfectly
tailored
that
the
fact
seemed
rather
an
advantage
than
otherwise
he
never
dreamed
of
going
near
the
but
he
did
go
a
good
deal
in
fact
most
of
the
time
to
the
nedahma
club
his
mother
spoke
often
to
her
friends
about
her
fears
for
his
health
he
never
spoke
to
his
friends
about
his
mother
at
all
the
second
madden
did
not
indeed
appeal
strongly
to
the
family
pride
she
had
been
a
miss
foley
a
and
an
old
maid
jeremiah
had
married
her
after
a
brief
widowerhood
principally
because
she
was
the
sister
of
his
parish
priest
and
had
a
considerable
reputation
for
piety
it
was
at
a
time
when
the
expansion
of
his
business
was
promising
certain
wealth
and
suggesting
the
removal
to
octavius
he
was
conscious
of
a
notion
that
his
obligations
to
social
respectability
were
increasing
it
was
certain
that
the
embarrassments
of
a
motherless
family
were
miss
foley
had
shown
a
good
deal
of
attention
to
his
little
children
she
was
not
she
bore
herself
with
modesty
she
was
the
priest
sister
the
niece
once
removed
of
a
and
so
it
came
about
although
those
most
concerned
did
not
say
so
everybody
could
see
from
the
outset
the
pity
of
its
ever
having
come
about
at
all
the
pious
and
stiffly
respectable
priest
sister
had
been
harmless
enough
as
a
spinster
it
made
the
heart
ache
to
contemplate
her
as
a
wife
incredibly
ignorant
suspicious
vain
and
she
must
have
driven
a
less
equable
and
man
than
jeremiah
madden
to
drink
or
flight
he
may
have
had
his
temptations
but
they
made
no
mark
on
the
even
record
of
his
life
he
only
worked
the
harder
concentrating
upon
his
business
those
extra
hours
which
another
sort
of
would
have
claimed
instead
the
end
of
twenty
years
found
him
a
rich
man
but
still
toiling
pertinaciously
day
by
day
as
if
he
had
his
wage
to
earn
in
the
great
house
which
had
been
built
to
please
or
rather
placate
his
wife
he
kept
to
himself
as
much
as
possible
the
popular
story
of
his
smoking
alone
in
the
kitchen
was
more
or
less
true
only
michael
as
a
rule
sat
with
him
too
for
tobacco
himself
but
reading
stray
scraps
from
the
papers
to
the
lonely
old
man
and
talking
with
him
about
the
works
the
while
jeremiah
meditatively
sucked
his
clay
pipe
one
or
two
evenings
in
the
week
the
twain
spent
up
in
celia
part
of
the
house
listening
with
the
awe
of
simple
honest
mechanics
to
the
music
she
played
for
them
celia
was
to
them
something
indefinably
less
indescribably
more
than
a
daughter
and
sister
they
could
not
think
there
had
ever
been
anything
like
her
before
in
the
world
the
notion
of
criticising
any
deed
or
word
of
hers
would
have
appeared
to
them
monstrous
and
unnatural
she
seemed
to
have
come
up
to
this
radiant
and
wise
and
marvellously
talented
womanhood
of
hers
to
their
minds
quite
spontaneously
there
had
been
a
little
celia
a
sulky
mutinous
slip
of
a
girl
always
at
war
with
her
and
affording
no
special
comfort
or
hope
to
the
rest
of
the
family
then
there
was
a
long
gap
during
which
the
father
four
times
a
year
handed
michael
a
letter
he
had
received
from
the
superioress
of
a
distant
convent
referring
with
cold
formality
to
the
studies
and
discipline
by
which
miss
madden
might
profit
more
if
she
had
been
better
brought
up
and
enclosing
a
large
bill
then
all
at
once
they
beheld
a
big
celia
whom
they
spoke
of
as
being
home
again
but
who
really
seemed
never
to
have
been
there
before
a
tall
handsome
confident
young
woman
swift
of
tongue
and
apprehension
appearing
to
know
everything
there
was
to
be
known
by
the
most
learned
able
to
paint
pictures
carve
wood
speak
in
divers
languages
and
make
music
for
the
gods
yet
with
it
all
a
very
proud
lady
one
might
say
a
queen
the
miracle
of
such
a
celia
as
this
impressed
itself
even
upon
the
madden
had
looked
forward
with
a
certain
grim
tightening
of
her
combative
jaws
to
the
of
the
she
felt
herself
much
more
the
fine
lady
now
than
she
had
been
when
the
girl
went
away
she
had
her
carriage
now
and
the
magnificent
new
house
was
nearly
finished
and
she
had
a
greater
number
of
ailments
and
spent
far
more
money
on
doctor
bills
than
any
other
lady
in
the
whole
section
the
flush
of
pride
in
her
greatest
achievement
up
to
date
having
the
most
celebrated
of
new
york
physicians
brought
up
to
octavius
by
special
train
still
prickled
in
her
blood
it
was
in
all
the
papers
and
the
admiration
of
the
flatterers
and
wives
of
irish
merchants
and
smaller
professional
men
who
formed
her
social
circle
was
raising
visions
in
her
poor
head
of
going
next
year
with
theodore
to
saratoga
and
fastening
the
attention
of
the
whole
fashionable
republic
upon
the
variety
and
resources
of
her
invalidism
madden
fancy
did
not
run
to
the
length
of
seeing
her
also
at
saratoga
it
pictured
her
still
as
the
sullen
and
hated
moping
defiantly
in
corners
or
courting
by
her
insolence
the
punishments
which
leaped
against
their
leash
in
the
mind
to
get
at
her
the
real
celia
when
she
came
fairly
took
madden
breath
away
the
peevish
little
plans
for
annoyance
and
tyranny
the
resolutions
born
of
ignorant
and
jealous
egotism
found
themselves
swept
out
of
sight
by
the
very
first
swirl
of
celia
when
she
came
down
from
her
room
robed
in
peacock
blue
the
could
only
stare
now
after
two
years
of
it
madden
still
viewed
her
with
uncertainty
not
unmixed
with
wrathful
fear
she
still
drove
about
behind
two
magnificent
horses
the
new
house
had
become
almost
tiresome
by
familiarity
her
in
the
interested
minds
of
the
dearborn
county
medical
society
was
as
towering
as
ever
but
somehow
it
was
all
different
there
was
a
note
of
unreality
nowadays
in
donnelly
professions
of
wonder
at
her
bearing
up
under
her
multiplied
maladies
there
was
almost
a
leer
of
mockery
in
the
sympathetic
smirk
with
which
the
misses
mangan
listened
to
her
symptoms
even
the
doctors
though
they
kept
their
faces
turned
toward
her
obviously
did
not
pay
much
attention
the
people
in
the
street
seemed
no
longer
to
look
at
her
and
her
equipage
at
all
worst
of
all
something
of
the
meaning
of
this
managed
to
penetrate
her
own
mind
she
caught
now
and
again
a
dim
glimpse
of
herself
as
others
must
have
been
seeing
her
for
years
as
a
stupid
ugly
boastful
and
old
nuisance
and
it
was
always
as
if
she
saw
this
in
a
mirror
held
up
by
celia
of
open
discord
there
had
been
next
to
none
celia
would
not
permit
it
and
showed
this
so
clearly
from
the
start
that
there
was
scarcely
need
for
her
saying
it
it
seemed
hardly
necessary
for
her
to
put
into
words
any
of
her
desires
for
that
matter
all
existing
arrangements
in
the
madden
household
seemed
to
shrink
automatically
and
make
room
for
her
whichever
way
she
walked
a
whole
quarter
of
the
unfinished
house
set
itself
apart
for
her
partitions
altered
themselves
moved
across
to
opposite
sides
a
recess
opened
itself
tall
and
deep
for
it
knew
not
what
statue
simply
because
it
seemed
the
lady
celia
willed
it
so
when
the
family
moved
into
this
mansion
it
was
with
a
consciousness
that
the
only
one
who
really
belonged
there
was
celia
she
alone
could
behave
like
one
perfectly
at
home
it
seemed
entirely
natural
to
the
others
that
she
should
do
just
what
she
liked
shut
them
off
from
her
portion
of
the
house
take
her
meals
there
if
she
felt
disposed
and
keep
such
hours
as
pleased
her
instant
whim
if
she
awakened
them
at
midnight
by
her
piano
or
deferred
her
breakfast
to
the
late
afternoon
they
felt
that
it
must
be
all
right
since
celia
did
it
she
had
one
room
furnished
with
only
divans
and
huge
soft
cushions
its
walls
covered
with
large
copies
of
statuary
not
too
strictly
clothed
which
she
would
suffer
no
one
not
even
the
servants
to
enter
michael
fancied
sometimes
when
he
passed
the
draped
entrance
to
this
sacred
chamber
that
the
portiere
smelt
of
tobacco
but
he
would
not
have
spoken
of
it
even
had
he
been
sure
old
jeremiah
whose
established
habit
it
was
to
audit
minutely
the
expenses
of
his
household
covered
over
round
sums
to
celia
separate
banking
account
upon
the
mere
playful
hint
of
her
holding
her
up
without
a
dream
of
questioning
her
that
the
had
joy
or
indeed
anything
but
gall
and
wormwood
out
of
all
this
is
not
to
be
pretended
there
lingered
along
in
the
recollection
of
the
family
some
vague
memories
of
her
having
tried
to
assert
an
authority
over
celia
comings
and
goings
at
the
outset
but
they
grouped
themselves
as
only
parts
of
the
general
disorder
of
moving
and
settling
which
a
or
so
quite
righted
madden
still
permitted
herself
a
certain
license
of
hostile
comment
when
her
was
not
present
and
listened
with
gratification
to
what
the
women
of
her
acquaintance
ventured
upon
saying
in
the
same
spirit
but
actual
interference
or
remonstrance
she
never
offered
nowadays
the
two
rarely
met
for
that
matter
and
exchanged
only
the
baldest
and
curtest
forms
of
speech
celia
madden
interested
all
octavius
deeply
this
she
must
have
done
in
any
case
if
only
because
she
was
the
only
daughter
of
its
richest
citizen
but
the
bold
luxuriant
quality
of
her
beauty
the
original
and
piquant
freedom
of
her
manners
the
stories
told
in
gossip
about
her
lawlessness
at
home
her
intellectual
attainments
and
artistic
vagaries
these
were
even
more
exciting
the
unlikelihood
of
her
marrying
any
one
at
least
any
octavian
was
felt
to
add
a
certain
romantic
zest
to
the
image
she
made
on
the
local
perceptions
there
was
no
visible
young
irishman
at
all
approaching
the
social
and
financial
standard
of
the
maddens
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
a
mixed
marriage
was
quite
out
of
the
question
in
this
case
she
seemed
to
have
more
business
about
the
church
than
even
the
priest
she
was
always
playing
the
organ
or
drilling
the
choir
or
decorating
the
altars
with
flowers
or
looking
over
the
robes
of
the
acolytes
for
rents
and
stains
or
going
in
or
out
of
the
pastorate
clearly
this
was
not
the
sort
of
girl
to
take
a
protestant
husband
the
gossip
of
the
town
concerning
her
was
however
exclusively
protestant
the
irish
spoke
of
her
even
among
themselves
but
seldom
there
was
no
occasion
for
them
to
pretend
to
like
her
they
did
not
know
her
except
in
the
most
distant
and
formal
fashion
even
the
members
of
the
choir
of
both
sexes
had
the
sense
of
being
held
away
from
her
at
haughty
arm
length
no
single
parishioner
dreamed
of
calling
her
friend
but
when
they
referred
to
her
it
was
always
with
a
cautious
and
respectful
reticence
for
one
thing
she
was
the
daughter
of
their
chief
man
the
man
they
most
esteemed
and
loved
for
another
reservations
they
may
have
had
in
their
souls
about
her
touched
close
upon
a
delicately
sore
spot
it
could
not
escape
their
notice
that
their
protestant
neighbors
were
watching
her
with
vigilant
curiosity
and
with
a
certain
tendency
to
wink
when
her
name
came
into
conversation
along
with
that
of
father
forbes
it
had
never
yet
got
beyond
a
tendency
the
barest
fluttering
suggestion
of
a
tempted
eyelid
but
the
whole
irish
population
of
the
place
felt
themselves
to
be
waiting
with
clenched
fists
but
sinking
hearts
for
the
wink
itself
the
rev
theron
ware
had
not
caught
even
the
faintest
hint
of
these
overtures
to
suspicion
when
he
had
entered
the
huge
dark
cool
vault
of
the
church
he
could
see
nothing
at
first
but
a
faint
light
up
over
the
gallery
far
at
the
other
end
then
little
by
little
his
surroundings
shaped
themselves
out
of
the
gloom
to
his
right
was
a
rail
and
some
broad
steps
rising
toward
a
softly
confused
mass
of
little
gray
vertical
bars
and
the
pale
twinkle
of
tiny
spots
of
gilded
reflection
which
he
made
out
in
the
dusk
to
be
the
candles
and
trappings
of
the
altar
overhead
the
great
arches
faded
away
from
foundations
of
dimly
discernible
capitals
into
utter
blackness
there
was
a
strange
medicinal
odor
as
of
cubeb
cigarettes
in
the
air
after
a
little
pause
he
tiptoed
noiselessly
up
the
side
aisle
toward
the
end
of
the
church
toward
the
light
above
the
gallery
this
radiance
from
a
single
expanded
as
he
advanced
and
spread
itself
upward
over
a
burnished
row
of
monster
metal
pipes
which
went
towering
into
the
darkness
like
giants
they
were
roaring
at
him
now
a
sonorous
deafening
angry
bellow
which
made
everything
about
him
vibrate
the
gallery
balustrade
hid
the
keyboard
and
the
organist
from
view
there
were
only
these
jostling
brazen
tubes
as
big
round
as
trees
and
as
tall
trembling
with
their
own
furious
thunder
it
was
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
had
wandered
into
some
vast
tragical
enchanted
cave
and
was
being
drawn
against
his
will
like
fascinated
bird
and
python
toward
fate
at
the
savage
hands
of
these
swollen
and
enraged
genii
he
stumbled
in
the
obscure
light
over
a
making
a
considerable
racket
on
the
instant
the
noise
from
the
organ
ceased
and
he
saw
the
black
figure
of
a
woman
rise
above
the
and
look
down
who
is
it
the
indubitable
voice
of
miss
madden
demanded
sharply
theron
had
a
sudden
sheepish
notion
of
turning
and
running
with
the
best
grace
he
could
summon
he
called
out
an
explanation
instead
wait
a
minute
i
through
now
i
coming
down
she
returned
he
thought
there
was
a
note
of
amusement
in
her
tone
she
came
to
him
a
moment
later
accompanied
by
a
thin
tall
man
whom
theron
could
barely
see
in
the
dark
now
that
the
too
was
gone
this
man
lighted
a
match
or
two
to
enable
them
to
make
their
way
out
when
they
were
on
the
sidewalk
celia
spoke
walk
on
ahead
michael
she
said
i
have
some
matters
to
speak
of
with
chapter
x
well
what
did
you
think
of
ledsmar
the
girl
abrupt
question
came
as
a
relief
to
theron
they
were
walking
along
in
a
darkness
so
nearly
complete
that
he
could
see
next
to
nothing
of
his
companion
for
some
reason
this
seemed
to
suggest
a
sort
of
impropriety
he
had
listened
to
the
footsteps
of
the
man
ahead
whom
he
guessed
to
be
a
servant
and
pictured
him
as
intent
upon
getting
up
early
next
morning
to
tell
everybody
that
the
methodist
minister
had
stolen
into
the
catholic
church
at
night
to
walk
home
with
miss
madden
that
was
going
to
be
very
awkward
yes
worse
than
awkward
it
might
mean
ruin
itself
she
had
mentioned
aloud
that
she
had
matters
to
talk
over
with
him
that
of
course
implied
confidences
and
the
man
might
put
heaven
only
knew
what
construction
on
that
it
was
notorious
that
servants
did
ascribe
the
very
worst
motives
to
those
they
worked
for
the
bare
thought
of
the
delight
an
irish
servant
would
have
in
also
dragging
a
protestant
clergyman
into
the
thing
was
sickening
and
what
could
she
want
to
talk
to
him
about
anyway
the
minute
of
silence
stretched
itself
out
upon
his
nerves
into
an
interminable
period
of
anxious
unhappiness
her
mention
of
the
doctor
at
last
somehow
seemed
to
lighten
the
situation
oh
i
thought
he
was
very
he
made
haste
to
answer
it
be
better
to
keep
close
to
your
man
he
may
think
we
gone
some
other
it
would
matter
if
he
did
remarked
celia
she
appeared
to
comprehend
his
nervousness
and
take
pity
on
it
for
she
added
it
is
my
brother
michael
as
good
a
soul
as
ever
lived
he
is
quite
used
to
my
the
rev
ware
drew
a
long
comforting
breath
oh
i
see
he
went
with
you
to
bring
you
to
blow
the
organ
said
the
girl
in
the
dark
correctingly
but
about
that
doctor
did
you
like
him
well
theron
began
is
rather
a
strong
word
for
so
short
an
acquaintance
he
talked
very
well
that
is
fluently
but
he
is
so
different
from
any
other
man
i
have
come
into
contact
with
that
what
i
wanted
you
to
say
was
that
you
hated
him
put
in
celia
firmly
i
do
make
a
practice
of
saying
that
of
anybody
returned
theron
so
much
at
his
ease
again
that
he
put
an
effect
of
gentle
smiling
reproof
into
the
words
and
why
specially
should
i
make
an
exception
for
him
because
he
a
beast
theron
fancied
that
he
understood
i
noticed
that
he
seemed
not
to
have
much
of
an
ear
for
music
he
commented
with
a
little
laugh
he
shut
down
the
window
when
you
began
to
play
his
doing
so
annoyed
me
because
i
i
wanted
very
much
to
hear
it
all
i
never
heard
such
music
before
i
i
came
into
the
church
to
hear
more
of
it
but
then
you
stopped
i
will
play
for
you
some
other
time
celia
said
answering
the
reproach
in
his
tone
but
tonight
i
wanted
to
talk
with
you
she
kept
silent
in
spite
of
this
so
long
now
that
theron
was
on
the
point
of
jestingly
asking
when
the
talk
was
to
begin
then
she
put
a
question
abruptly
it
is
a
conventional
way
of
putting
it
but
are
you
fond
of
poetry
ware
well
yes
i
suppose
i
am
replied
theron
much
mystified
i
say
that
i
am
any
great
judge
but
i
like
the
things
that
i
like
and
meredith
interposed
celia
makes
one
of
his
women
emilia
in
england
say
that
poetry
is
like
talking
on
tiptoe
like
animals
in
cages
always
going
to
one
end
and
back
again
does
it
impress
you
that
way
i
do
know
that
it
does
said
he
dubiously
it
seemed
however
to
be
her
whim
to
talk
literature
and
he
went
on
i
hardly
read
meredith
at
all
i
once
borrowed
his
but
somehow
i
never
got
interested
in
it
i
heard
a
recitation
of
his
once
though
a
piece
about
a
dead
wife
and
the
husband
and
another
man
quarrelling
as
to
whose
portrait
was
in
the
locket
on
her
neck
and
of
their
going
up
to
settle
the
dispute
and
finding
that
it
was
the
likeness
of
a
third
man
a
young
priest
and
though
it
was
very
striking
it
did
give
me
a
thirst
to
know
his
other
poems
i
fancied
i
should
like
them
but
i
daresay
i
was
wrong
as
i
get
older
i
find
that
i
take
less
narrow
views
of
literature
that
is
of
course
of
light
literature
and
that
that
celia
mercifully
stopped
him
the
reason
i
asked
you
was
she
began
and
then
herself
paused
or
no
never
mind
that
tell
me
something
else
are
you
fond
of
pictures
statuary
the
beautiful
things
of
the
world
do
great
works
of
art
the
big
achievements
of
the
big
artists
appeal
to
you
stir
you
up
alas
that
is
something
i
can
only
guess
at
myself
answered
theron
humbly
i
have
always
lived
in
little
places
i
suppose
from
your
point
of
view
i
have
never
seen
a
good
painting
in
my
life
i
can
only
say
this
though
that
it
has
always
weighed
on
my
mind
as
a
great
and
sore
deprivation
this
being
shut
out
from
knowing
what
others
mean
when
they
talk
and
write
about
art
perhaps
that
may
help
you
to
get
at
what
you
are
after
if
i
ever
went
to
new
york
i
feel
that
one
of
the
first
things
i
should
do
would
be
to
see
all
the
picture
galleries
is
that
what
you
meant
and
would
you
mind
telling
me
why
you
why
i
asked
you
celia
supplied
his
halting
question
no
i
mind
i
have
a
reason
for
wanting
to
know
to
satisfy
myself
whether
i
had
guessed
rightly
or
not
about
the
kind
of
man
you
are
i
mean
in
the
matter
of
temperament
and
bent
of
mind
and
the
girl
seemed
to
be
speaking
seriously
and
without
intent
to
offend
theron
did
not
find
any
comment
ready
but
walked
along
by
her
side
wondering
much
what
it
was
all
about
i
daresay
you
think
me
familiar
on
short
acquaintance
she
continued
after
a
little
my
dear
miss
madden
he
protested
perfunctorily
no
it
is
a
matter
of
a
good
deal
of
importance
she
went
on
i
can
see
that
you
are
going
to
be
thrown
into
friendship
close
contact
with
father
forbes
he
likes
you
and
you
ca
help
liking
him
there
is
nobody
else
in
this
raw
overgrown
place
for
you
and
him
to
like
nobody
except
that
man
that
ledsmar
and
if
you
like
him
i
shall
hate
you
he
has
done
mischief
enough
already
i
am
counting
on
you
to
help
undo
it
and
to
choke
him
off
from
doing
more
it
would
be
different
if
you
were
an
ordinary
orthodox
minister
all
encased
like
a
terrapin
in
prejudices
and
nonsense
of
course
if
you
had
been
that
kind
we
should
never
have
got
to
know
you
at
all
but
when
i
saw
you
in
macevoy
cottage
there
it
was
plain
that
you
were
one
of
us
i
mean
a
man
and
not
a
marionette
or
a
mummy
i
am
talking
very
frankly
to
you
you
see
i
want
you
on
my
side
against
that
doctor
and
his
heartless
bloodless
i
feel
myself
very
heartily
on
your
side
replied
theron
she
had
set
their
progress
at
a
slower
pace
now
that
the
lights
of
the
main
street
were
drawing
near
as
if
to
prolong
their
talk
all
his
earlier
reservations
had
fled
it
was
almost
as
if
she
were
a
parishioner
of
his
own
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
the
doctor
whole
attitude
toward
toward
revelation
was
deeply
repugnant
to
me
it
does
make
it
any
the
less
hateful
to
call
it
science
i
am
afraid
though
he
went
on
hesitatingly
that
there
are
difficulties
in
the
way
of
my
helping
as
you
call
it
you
see
the
very
fact
of
my
being
a
methodist
minister
and
his
being
a
catholic
priest
rather
puts
my
interference
out
of
the
no
that
does
matter
a
button
said
celia
lightly
none
of
us
think
of
that
at
there
is
the
other
embarrassment
then
pursued
theron
diffidently
that
father
forbes
is
a
vastly
broader
and
deeper
scholar
in
all
these
matters
than
i
am
how
could
i
possibly
hope
to
influence
him
by
my
poor
arguments
i
do
know
even
the
alphabet
of
the
language
he
thinks
in
on
these
subjects
i
of
course
you
do
interposed
the
girl
with
a
confidence
which
the
other
for
all
his
meekness
rather
winced
under
that
was
what
i
meant
at
all
we
do
want
arguments
from
our
friends
we
want
sympathies
sensibilities
emotional
bonds
the
right
person
silence
is
worth
more
for
companionship
than
the
wisest
talk
in
the
world
from
anybody
else
it
is
your
mind
that
is
needed
here
or
what
you
know
it
is
your
heart
and
what
you
feel
you
are
full
of
poetry
of
ideals
of
generous
unselfish
impulses
you
see
the
human
the
side
of
things
that
is
what
is
really
valuable
that
is
how
you
can
help
you
overestimate
me
sadly
protested
theron
though
with
considerable
tolerance
for
her
error
in
his
tone
but
you
ought
to
tell
me
something
about
this
ledsmar
he
spoke
of
being
an
old
friend
of
the
pr
of
father
oh
yes
they
always
known
each
other
that
is
for
many
years
they
were
professors
together
in
a
college
once
heaven
only
knows
how
long
ago
then
they
separated
i
fancy
they
quarrelled
too
before
they
parted
the
doctor
came
here
where
some
relative
had
left
him
the
place
he
lives
in
then
in
time
the
bishop
chanced
to
send
father
forbes
here
that
was
about
three
years
ago
and
the
two
men
after
a
while
renewed
their
old
relations
they
dine
together
that
is
the
stronghold
he
knows
more
about
eating
than
any
other
man
alive
i
believe
he
studies
it
as
you
would
study
a
language
he
has
taught
old
maggie
at
the
pastorate
there
to
cook
like
the
mother
of
all
the
delmonicos
and
while
they
sit
and
stuff
themselves
or
loll
about
afterward
like
gorged
snakes
they
think
it
is
smart
to
laugh
at
all
the
sweet
and
beautiful
things
in
life
and
to
sneer
at
people
who
believe
in
ideals
and
to
talk
about
mankind
being
merely
a
fortuitous
product
of
fermentation
and
twaddle
of
that
sort
it
makes
me
sick
i
can
readily
see
said
theron
with
sympathy
how
such
a
cold
material
and
infidel
influence
as
that
must
shock
and
revolt
an
essentially
religious
temperament
like
miss
madden
looked
up
at
him
they
had
turned
into
the
main
street
and
there
was
light
enough
for
him
to
detect
something
startlingly
like
a
grin
on
her
beautiful
face
but
i
not
religious
at
all
you
know
he
heard
her
say
i
as
pagan
as
anything
of
course
there
are
forms
to
be
observed
and
so
on
i
rather
like
them
than
otherwise
i
can
make
them
serve
very
well
for
my
own
system
for
i
am
myself
you
know
an
why
i
had
supposed
that
you
were
full
blooded
irish
the
rev
ware
found
himself
remarking
and
then
on
the
instant
was
overwhelmed
by
the
consciousness
that
he
had
said
a
foolish
thing
precisely
where
the
folly
lay
he
did
not
know
but
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
the
gesture
of
annoyance
which
his
companion
had
instinctively
made
at
his
words
she
had
widened
the
distance
between
them
now
and
quickened
her
step
they
went
on
in
silence
till
they
were
within
a
block
of
her
house
several
people
had
passed
them
who
theron
felt
sure
must
have
recognized
them
both
what
i
meant
was
the
girl
all
at
once
began
drawing
nearer
again
and
speaking
with
patient
slowness
that
i
find
myself
much
more
in
sympathy
with
the
greek
thought
the
greek
theology
of
the
beautiful
and
the
strong
the
greek
philosophy
of
life
and
all
that
than
what
is
taught
nowadays
personally
i
take
much
more
stock
in
plato
than
i
do
in
peter
but
of
course
it
is
a
wholly
personal
affair
i
had
no
business
to
bother
you
with
it
and
for
that
matter
i
ought
to
have
troubled
you
with
any
of
our
i
assure
you
miss
madden
the
young
minister
began
with
fervor
no
she
broke
in
in
a
resigned
and
even
downcast
tone
let
it
all
be
as
if
i
had
spoken
do
mind
anything
i
have
said
if
it
is
to
be
it
will
be
you
ca
say
more
than
that
can
you
she
looked
into
his
face
again
and
her
large
eyes
produced
an
impression
of
deep
melancholy
which
theron
found
himself
somehow
impelled
to
share
things
seemed
all
at
once
to
have
become
very
sad
indeed
it
is
one
of
my
unhappy
nights
she
explained
in
gloomy
confidence
i
get
them
every
once
in
a
while
as
if
some
vicious
planet
or
other
was
crossing
in
front
of
my
good
star
and
then
i
a
caution
to
snakes
i
shut
myself
up
that
the
only
thing
to
do
and
have
it
out
with
myself
i
did
know
but
the
would
calm
me
down
but
it
has
i
sha
sleep
a
wink
tonight
but
just
rage
around
from
one
room
to
another
piling
all
the
cushions
from
the
divans
on
to
the
floor
and
then
kicking
them
away
again
do
you
ever
have
fits
like
that
theron
was
able
to
reply
with
a
good
conscience
in
the
negative
it
occurred
to
him
to
add
with
jocose
intent
i
am
curious
to
know
do
these
fits
as
you
call
them
occupy
a
prominent
part
in
grecian
philosophy
as
a
general
rule
celia
gave
a
little
snort
which
might
have
signified
amusement
but
did
not
speak
until
they
were
upon
her
own
sidewalk
there
is
my
brother
waiting
at
the
gate
she
said
then
briefly
well
then
i
will
bid
you
here
i
think
theron
remarked
coming
to
a
halt
and
offering
his
hand
it
must
be
getting
very
late
and
my
that
is
i
have
to
be
up
particularly
early
tomorrow
so
i
hope
you
will
be
feeling
ever
so
much
better
in
spirits
in
the
oh
that
does
matter
replied
the
girl
listlessly
it
a
very
paltry
little
affair
this
life
of
ours
at
the
best
of
it
luckily
soon
done
with
like
a
bad
tut
tut
i
wo
have
you
talk
like
that
interrupted
theron
with
a
swift
and
smart
assumption
of
authority
such
talk
is
sensible
and
it
is
good
i
have
no
patience
with
it
well
try
and
have
a
little
patience
with
me
anyway
just
for
tonight
said
celia
taking
the
reproof
with
gentlest
humility
rather
to
her
censor
surprise
i
really
am
unhappy
tonight
ware
very
unhappy
it
seems
as
if
all
at
once
the
world
had
swelled
out
in
size
a
thousandfold
and
that
poor
me
had
dwindled
down
to
the
merest
wee
little
atom
the
most
helpless
and
forlorn
and
lonesome
of
atoms
at
she
seemed
to
force
a
sorrowful
smile
on
her
face
as
she
added
but
all
the
same
it
has
done
me
good
to
be
with
you
i
am
sure
it
has
and
i
daresay
that
by
tomorrow
i
shall
be
quite
out
of
the
blues
ware
forgive
my
making
such
an
exhibition
of
myself
i
was
going
to
be
such
a
fine
early
greek
you
know
and
i
have
turned
out
only
a
late
milesian
quite
of
the
decadence
i
shall
do
better
next
time
and
again
and
ever
so
many
she
was
walking
briskly
away
toward
the
gate
now
where
the
shadowy
michael
still
patiently
stood
theron
strode
off
in
the
opposite
direction
taking
long
deliberate
steps
and
bowing
his
head
in
thought
he
had
his
hands
behind
his
back
as
was
his
wont
and
the
sense
of
their
recent
contact
with
her
firm
ungloved
hands
was
curiously
enough
the
thing
which
pushed
itself
uppermost
in
his
mind
there
had
been
a
frank
almost
manly
vigor
in
her
grasp
he
said
to
himself
that
of
course
that
came
from
her
playing
so
much
on
the
keyboard
the
exercise
naturally
would
give
her
large
robust
hands
suddenly
he
remembered
about
the
piano
he
had
quite
forgotten
to
solicit
her
aid
in
selecting
it
he
turned
upon
the
impulse
to
go
back
she
had
not
entered
the
gate
as
yet
but
stood
shiningly
visible
under
the
street
lamp
on
the
sidewalk
and
she
was
looking
in
his
direction
he
turned
again
like
a
shot
and
started
homeward
the
front
door
of
the
parsonage
was
unlocked
and
he
made
his
way
on
tiptoe
through
the
unlighted
hall
to
the
the
stuffy
air
here
was
almost
suffocating
with
the
evil
smell
of
a
kerosene
lamp
turned
down
too
low
alice
sat
asleep
in
her
old
farmhouse
with
an
inelegant
on
the
table
by
her
side
the
whole
effect
of
the
room
was
as
bare
and
squalid
to
newly
informed
eye
as
the
atmosphere
was
offensive
to
his
nostrils
he
coughed
sharply
and
his
wife
sat
up
and
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
after
eleven
where
on
earth
have
you
been
she
asked
with
a
yawn
turning
up
the
wick
of
her
again
you
ought
never
to
turn
down
a
light
like
that
said
theron
with
a
complaining
note
in
his
voice
it
smells
up
the
whole
place
i
never
dreamed
of
your
sitting
up
for
me
like
this
you
ought
to
have
gone
to
but
how
could
i
guess
that
you
were
going
to
be
so
late
she
retorted
and
you
have
told
me
where
you
were
is
this
book
of
yours
going
to
keep
you
up
like
this
right
along
the
episode
of
the
book
was
buried
in
the
young
minister
mind
beneath
such
a
mass
of
subsequent
experiences
that
it
required
an
effort
for
him
to
grasp
what
she
was
talking
about
it
seemed
as
if
months
had
elapsed
since
he
was
in
earnest
about
that
book
and
yet
he
had
left
the
house
full
of
it
only
a
few
hours
before
he
shook
his
wits
together
and
made
answer
oh
bless
you
no
only
there
arose
a
very
curious
question
you
have
no
idea
literally
no
conception
of
the
interesting
and
important
problems
which
are
raised
by
the
mere
fact
of
abraham
leaving
the
city
of
ur
it
amazing
i
assure
you
i
had
realized
it
well
remarked
alice
rising
and
with
and
petulance
struggling
sleepily
ill
her
tone
all
i
got
to
say
is
that
if
abraham
has
anything
better
to
do
than
to
keep
young
ministers
of
the
gospel
out
goodness
knows
where
till
all
hours
of
the
night
i
wish
to
gracious
he
stayed
in
the
city
of
ur
right
straight
you
have
no
idea
what
a
scholarly
man
ledsmar
is
theron
suddenly
found
himself
inspired
to
volunteer
he
has
the
most
marvellous
collection
of
books
a
whole
library
devoted
to
this
very
subject
and
he
has
put
them
all
quite
freely
at
my
disposal
extremely
kind
of
him
is
it
ledsmar
ledsmar
queried
alice
i
do
seem
to
remember
the
name
he
is
the
little
man
with
the
birthmark
who
sits
in
the
pew
behind
the
lovejoys
is
he
i
think
some
one
said
he
was
a
yes
a
horse
doctor
said
theron
with
a
sniff
no
you
have
seen
this
ledsmar
at
all
i
i
do
know
that
he
attends
any
church
regularly
i
scraped
his
acquaintance
quite
by
accident
he
is
really
a
character
he
lives
in
the
big
house
just
beyond
the
you
know
the
one
with
the
tower
at
the
back
no
i
do
know
how
should
i
i
hardly
poked
my
nose
outside
of
the
yard
since
i
have
been
well
you
shall
go
said
the
husband
consolingly
you
have
been
cooped
up
here
too
much
poor
girl
i
must
take
you
out
more
really
i
do
know
that
i
could
take
you
to
the
doctor
place
without
an
invitation
i
mean
he
is
very
queer
about
some
things
he
lives
there
all
alone
for
instance
with
only
a
chinaman
for
a
servant
he
told
me
i
was
almost
the
only
man
he
had
asked
under
his
roof
for
years
he
is
a
practising
physician
at
all
you
know
he
is
a
scientist
he
makes
experiments
with
lizards
and
theron
the
wife
said
pausing
lamp
in
hand
on
her
way
to
the
bedroom
do
you
be
careful
now
for
all
you
know
this
doctor
may
be
a
loose
man
or
pretty
near
an
infidel
you
got
to
be
mighty
particular
in
such
matters
you
know
or
you
have
the
trustees
down
on
you
like
a
of
bricks
i
will
thank
the
trustees
to
mind
their
own
business
said
theron
stiffly
and
the
subject
dropped
the
bedroom
window
upstairs
was
open
and
upon
the
fresh
night
air
was
borne
in
the
shrill
jangling
sound
of
a
piano
being
played
off
somewhere
in
the
distance
but
so
vehemently
that
the
noise
imposed
itself
upon
the
silence
far
and
wide
theron
listened
to
this
as
he
undressed
it
proceeded
from
the
direction
of
the
main
street
and
he
knew
as
by
instinct
that
it
was
the
madden
girl
who
was
playing
the
incongruity
of
the
hour
escaped
his
notice
he
mused
instead
upon
the
wild
and
tropical
tangle
of
moods
emotions
passions
which
had
grown
up
in
that
strange
temperament
he
found
something
very
pathetic
in
that
picture
she
had
drawn
of
herself
in
forecast
roaming
disconsolate
through
her
rooms
the
livelong
night
unable
to
sleep
the
woful
moan
of
insomnia
seemed
to
make
itself
heard
in
every
strain
from
her
piano
alice
heard
it
also
but
being
unillumined
she
missed
the
romantic
pathos
i
call
it
disgraceful
she
muttered
from
her
pillow
for
folks
to
be
banging
away
on
a
piano
at
this
time
of
night
there
ought
to
be
a
law
to
prevent
it
may
be
some
distressed
soul
said
theron
gently
seeking
relief
from
the
curse
of
the
wife
laughed
almost
contemptuously
distressed
fiddlesticks
was
her
only
other
comment
the
music
went
on
for
a
long
time
rising
now
to
strident
heights
now
sinking
off
to
the
merest
tinkling
murmur
and
broken
ever
and
again
by
intervals
of
utter
hush
it
did
not
prevent
alice
from
at
once
falling
sound
asleep
but
theron
lay
awake
it
seemed
to
him
for
hours
listening
tranquilly
and
letting
his
mind
wander
at
will
through
the
pleasant
antechambers
of
sleep
where
are
more
unreal
fantasies
than
dreamland
itself
affords
part
ii
chapter
xi
for
some
weeks
the
rev
theron
ware
saw
nothing
of
either
the
priest
or
the
doctor
or
the
interesting
miss
madden
there
were
indeed
more
urgent
matters
to
think
about
june
had
come
and
every
succeeding
day
brought
closer
to
hand
the
ordeal
of
his
first
quarterly
conference
in
octavius
the
waters
grew
distinctly
rougher
as
his
pastoral
bark
neared
this
difficult
passage
he
would
have
approached
the
great
event
with
an
easier
mind
if
he
could
have
made
out
just
how
he
stood
with
his
congregation
unfortunately
nothing
in
his
previous
experiences
helped
him
in
the
least
to
measure
or
guess
at
the
feelings
of
these
curious
octavians
their
methodism
seemed
to
be
sound
enough
and
to
stick
quite
to
the
letter
of
the
discipline
so
long
as
it
was
expressed
in
formulae
it
was
its
spirit
which
he
felt
to
be
complicated
by
all
sorts
of
conditions
wholly
novel
to
him
the
existence
of
a
line
of
in
the
town
for
example
would
not
impress
the
casual
thinker
as
likely
to
prove
a
rock
in
the
path
of
peaceful
religion
theron
in
his
simplicity
had
even
thought
when
he
first
saw
these
bobtailed
cars
bumping
along
the
rails
in
the
middle
of
the
main
street
that
they
must
be
a
great
convenience
to
people
living
in
the
outskirts
who
wished
to
get
in
to
church
of
a
sunday
morning
he
was
imprudent
enough
to
mention
this
in
conversation
with
one
of
his
new
parishioners
then
he
learned
to
his
considerable
chagrin
that
when
this
line
was
built
some
years
before
a
bitter
war
of
words
had
been
fought
upon
the
question
of
its
being
worked
on
the
sabbath
day
the
then
occupant
of
the
methodist
pulpit
had
so
distinguished
himself
above
the
rest
by
the
solemnity
and
fervor
of
his
protests
against
this
insolent
desecration
of
god
day
that
the
methodists
of
octavius
still
felt
themselves
peculiarly
bound
to
hold
this
line
its
management
and
everything
connected
with
it
in
unbending
aversion
at
least
once
a
year
they
were
accustomed
to
expect
a
sermon
denouncing
it
and
all
its
impious
sunday
patrons
theron
made
a
mental
resolve
that
this
year
they
should
be
disappointed
another
burning
problem
which
he
had
not
been
called
upon
before
to
confront
he
found
now
entangled
with
the
mysterious
line
which
divided
a
circus
from
a
menagerie
those
itinerant
had
never
come
his
way
heretofore
and
he
knew
nothing
of
that
fine
balancing
proportion
between
ladies
in
tights
on
horseback
and
cages
full
of
deeply
educational
animals
which
even
as
the
impartial
rain
was
designed
to
embrace
alike
the
just
and
the
unjust
there
had
arisen
inside
the
methodist
society
of
octavius
some
painful
episodes
connected
with
members
who
took
their
children
just
to
see
the
animals
and
were
convicted
of
having
also
watched
the
of
the
arena
in
her
unequalled
flying
leap
through
eight
hoops
with
an
ardent
and
unashamed
eye
one
of
these
cases
still
remained
on
the
censorial
docket
of
the
church
and
theron
understood
that
he
was
expected
to
name
a
committee
of
five
to
examine
and
try
it
this
he
neglected
to
do
he
was
no
longer
at
all
certain
that
the
congregation
as
a
whole
liked
his
sermons
the
truth
was
no
doubt
that
he
had
learned
enough
to
cease
regarding
the
congregation
as
a
whole
he
could
still
rely
upon
carrying
along
with
him
in
his
discourses
from
the
pulpit
a
large
majority
of
interested
and
approving
faces
but
here
unhappily
was
a
case
where
the
majority
did
not
rule
the
minority
relatively
small
in
numbers
was
prodigious
in
virile
force
more
than
twenty
years
had
now
elapsed
since
that
minor
schism
in
the
methodist
episcopal
church
the
result
of
which
was
the
independent
body
known
as
free
methodists
had
relieved
the
parent
flock
of
its
principal
disturbing
element
the
rupture
came
fittingly
at
that
time
when
all
the
isms
of
the
argumentative
fifties
were
hurled
violently
together
into
the
of
civil
war
the
great
methodist
church
south
had
broken
bodily
off
on
the
question
of
state
rights
the
smaller
and
domestic
fraction
of
free
methodism
separated
itself
upon
an
issue
which
may
be
most
readily
described
as
one
of
civilization
the
seceders
resented
growth
in
material
prosperity
they
repudiated
the
introduction
of
written
sermons
and
they
deplored
the
increasing
laxity
in
meddlesome
piety
the
introduction
of
polite
manners
in
the
pulpit
and
classroom
and
the
development
of
even
a
rudimentary
desire
among
the
younger
people
of
the
church
to
be
like
others
outside
in
dress
and
speech
and
deportment
they
did
battle
as
long
as
they
could
inside
the
fold
to
restore
it
to
the
severely
straight
and
narrow
path
of
primitive
methodism
when
the
adverse
odds
became
too
strong
for
them
they
quitted
the
church
and
set
up
a
bethel
for
themselves
octavius
chanced
to
be
one
of
the
places
where
they
were
able
to
hold
their
own
within
the
church
organization
the
methodism
of
the
town
had
gone
along
without
any
local
secession
it
still
held
in
full
fellowship
the
radicals
who
elsewhere
had
followed
their
unbridled
bent
into
the
strongest
emotional
vagaries
where
excited
brethren
worked
themselves
up
into
epileptic
fits
and
women
whirled
themselves
about
in
weird
religious
ecstasies
like
dervishes
of
the
orient
till
they
fell
headlong
in
a
state
of
trance
octavian
methodism
was
spared
extravagances
of
this
sort
it
is
true
but
it
paid
a
price
for
the
immunity
the
people
whom
an
open
split
would
have
taken
away
remained
to
leaven
and
dominate
the
whole
lump
this
small
advanced
section
with
its
men
of
a
type
all
the
more
aggressive
from
its
narrowness
and
women
who
went
about
solemnly
in
plain
gray
garments
with
unadorned
sunbonnets
had
not
been
able
wholly
to
enforce
its
views
upon
the
social
life
of
the
church
members
but
of
its
controlling
influence
upon
their
official
and
public
actions
there
could
be
no
doubt
the
situation
had
begun
to
unfold
itself
to
theron
from
the
outset
he
had
recognized
the
episodes
of
the
forbidden
sunday
milk
and
of
the
flowers
in
poor
alice
bonnet
as
typical
of
much
more
that
was
to
come
no
week
followed
without
bringing
some
new
fulfilment
of
this
foreboding
now
at
the
end
of
two
months
he
knew
well
enough
that
the
hitherto
dominant
minority
was
hostile
to
him
and
his
ministry
and
would
do
whatever
it
could
against
him
though
theron
at
once
decided
to
show
fight
and
did
not
at
all
waver
in
that
resolve
his
courage
was
in
the
main
of
a
despondent
sort
sometimes
it
would
flutter
up
to
the
point
of
confidence
or
at
least
hopefulness
when
he
met
with
substantial
men
of
the
church
who
obviously
liked
him
and
whom
he
found
himself
mentally
ranging
on
his
side
in
the
struggle
which
was
to
come
but
more
often
it
was
blankly
apparent
to
him
that
the
moment
flags
were
flying
and
drums
on
the
roll
these
amiable
friends
would
probably
take
to
their
heels
still
such
as
they
were
his
sole
hope
lay
in
their
support
he
must
make
the
best
of
them
he
set
himself
doggedly
to
the
task
of
gathering
together
all
those
who
were
not
his
enemies
into
what
when
the
proper
time
came
should
be
known
as
the
pastor
party
there
was
plenty
of
apostolic
warrant
for
this
if
there
had
not
been
theron
felt
that
the
mere
elementary
demands
of
would
have
justified
his
use
of
strategy
the
institution
of
pastoral
calling
particularly
that
inquisitorial
form
of
it
laid
down
in
the
discipline
had
never
attracted
theron
he
and
alice
had
gone
about
among
their
previous
flocks
in
quite
a
haphazard
fashion
without
thought
of
system
much
less
of
deliberate
purpose
theron
made
lists
now
and
devoted
thought
and
examination
to
the
personal
tastes
and
characteristics
of
the
people
to
be
cultivated
there
were
some
for
example
who
would
expect
him
to
talk
pretty
much
as
the
discipline
ordained
that
is
to
ask
if
they
had
family
prayer
to
inquire
after
their
souls
and
generally
to
minister
grace
to
his
hearers
and
these
in
turn
subdivided
themselves
into
classes
ranging
from
those
who
would
wish
nothing
else
to
those
who
needed
only
a
mild
spiritual
flavor
there
were
others
whom
he
would
please
much
better
by
not
talking
shop
at
all
although
he
could
ill
afford
it
he
subscribed
now
for
a
daily
paper
that
he
might
have
a
perpetually
renewed
source
of
good
conversational
topics
for
these
more
worldly
calls
he
also
bought
several
pounds
of
candy
pleasing
in
color
but
warranted
to
be
entirely
harmless
and
he
made
a
large
mysterious
mark
on
the
inside
of
his
new
silk
hat
to
remind
him
not
to
go
out
calling
without
some
of
this
in
his
pocket
for
the
children
alice
he
felt
was
not
helping
him
in
this
matter
as
effectively
as
he
could
have
wished
her
attitude
toward
the
church
in
octavius
might
best
be
described
by
the
word
great
allowance
was
to
be
made
he
realized
for
her
humiliation
over
the
flowers
in
her
bonnet
that
might
justify
her
fairly
enough
in
being
kept
away
from
meeting
now
and
again
by
headaches
or
undefined
megrims
but
it
ought
not
to
prevent
her
from
going
about
and
making
friends
among
the
kindlier
parishioners
who
would
welcome
such
a
thing
and
whom
he
from
time
to
time
indicated
to
her
she
did
go
to
some
extent
it
is
true
but
she
produced
in
doing
so
an
effect
of
performing
a
duty
he
did
not
find
traces
anywhere
of
her
having
created
a
brilliant
social
impression
when
they
went
out
together
he
was
peculiarly
conscious
of
having
to
do
the
work
unaided
this
was
not
at
all
like
the
alice
of
former
years
of
other
charges
why
she
had
been
beyond
comparison
the
most
popular
young
woman
in
tyre
what
possessed
her
to
mope
like
this
in
octavius
theron
looked
at
her
attentively
nowadays
when
she
was
unaware
of
his
gaze
to
try
if
her
face
offered
any
answer
to
the
riddle
it
could
not
be
suggested
that
she
was
never
in
her
life
had
she
been
looking
so
well
she
had
thrown
herself
all
at
once
and
with
what
was
to
him
an
unaccountable
energy
into
the
creation
and
management
of
a
she
was
out
the
better
part
of
every
day
rain
or
shine
digging
transplanting
pruning
pottering
generally
about
among
her
plants
and
shrubs
this
work
in
the
open
air
had
given
her
an
aspect
of
physical
which
it
was
impossible
to
be
mistaken
about
her
husband
was
glad
of
course
that
she
had
found
some
occupation
which
at
once
pleased
her
and
so
obviously
conduced
to
health
this
was
so
much
a
matter
of
course
in
fact
that
he
said
to
himself
over
and
over
again
that
he
was
glad
only
only
sometimes
the
thought
would
force
itself
upon
his
attention
that
if
she
did
not
spend
so
much
of
her
time
in
her
own
garden
she
would
have
more
time
to
devote
to
winning
friends
for
them
in
the
garden
of
the
lord
friends
whom
they
were
going
to
need
badly
the
young
minister
in
taking
anxious
stock
of
the
chances
for
and
against
him
turned
over
often
in
his
mind
the
fact
that
he
had
already
won
rank
as
a
pulpit
orator
his
sermons
had
attracted
almost
universal
attention
at
tyre
and
his
achievement
before
the
conference
at
tecumseh
if
it
did
fail
to
receive
practical
reward
had
admittedly
distanced
all
the
other
preaching
there
it
was
a
part
of
the
evil
luck
pursuing
him
that
here
in
this
perversely
enigmatic
octavius
his
special
gift
seemed
to
be
of
no
use
whatever
there
were
times
indeed
when
he
was
tempted
to
think
that
bad
preaching
was
what
octavius
wanted
somewhere
he
had
heard
of
a
presbyterian
minister
in
charge
of
a
big
city
church
who
managed
to
keep
well
in
with
a
watchfully
orthodox
congregation
and
at
the
same
time
establish
himself
in
the
affections
of
the
community
at
large
by
simply
preaching
two
kinds
of
sermons
in
the
morning
when
almost
all
who
attended
were
his
own
communicants
he
gave
them
very
cautious
and
edifying
doctrinal
discourses
treading
loyally
in
the
path
of
the
westminster
confession
to
the
evening
assemblages
made
up
for
the
larger
part
of
outsiders
he
addressed
broadly
liberal
sermons
literary
in
form
and
full
of
respectful
allusions
to
modern
science
and
the
philosophy
of
the
day
thus
he
filled
the
church
at
both
services
and
put
money
in
its
treasury
and
his
own
fame
before
the
world
there
was
of
course
the
obvious
danger
that
the
pious
elders
who
in
the
forenoon
heard
infant
damnation
vigorously
proclaimed
would
revolt
when
they
heard
after
supper
that
there
was
some
doubt
about
even
adults
being
damned
at
all
but
either
because
the
same
people
did
not
attend
both
services
or
because
the
minister
perfect
regularity
in
the
morning
was
each
week
regarded
as
a
retraction
of
his
latest
vagaries
of
an
evening
no
trouble
ever
came
theron
had
somewhat
tentatively
tried
this
on
in
octavius
it
was
no
good
his
parishioners
were
of
the
sort
who
would
have
come
to
church
eight
times
a
day
on
sunday
instead
of
two
if
occasion
offered
the
hope
that
even
a
portion
of
them
would
stop
away
and
that
their
places
would
be
taken
in
the
evening
by
less
prejudiced
strangers
who
wished
for
intellectual
rather
than
theological
food
fell
by
the
wayside
the
strangers
did
not
come
the
familiar
faces
of
the
morning
service
all
turned
up
in
their
accustomed
places
every
evening
they
were
faces
which
confused
and
disheartened
theron
in
the
daytime
under
the
gaslight
they
seemed
even
harder
and
more
unsympathetic
he
timorously
experimented
with
them
for
an
evening
or
two
then
abandoned
the
effort
once
there
had
seemed
the
beginning
of
a
chance
the
richest
banker
in
octavius
a
fat
sensual
old
bachelor
surprised
everybody
one
evening
by
entering
the
church
and
taking
a
seat
theron
happened
to
know
who
he
was
even
if
he
had
not
known
the
suppressed
excitement
visible
in
the
congregation
the
way
the
sisters
turned
round
to
look
the
way
the
more
important
brethren
put
their
heads
together
and
exchanged
furtive
whispers
would
have
warned
him
that
big
game
was
in
view
he
recalled
afterward
with
something
like
the
eager
almost
tremulous
pains
he
himself
took
to
please
this
banker
there
was
a
part
of
the
sermon
as
it
had
been
written
out
which
might
easily
give
offence
to
a
single
man
of
wealth
and
free
notions
of
life
with
the
alertness
of
a
mental
gymnast
theron
ran
ahead
excised
this
portion
and
had
ready
when
the
gap
was
reached
some
very
pretty
general
remarks
all
the
more
effective
and
eloquent
he
felt
for
having
been
extemporized
people
said
it
was
a
good
sermon
and
after
the
benediction
and
dispersion
some
of
the
officials
and
principal
remained
to
talk
over
the
likelihood
of
a
capture
having
been
effected
theron
did
not
get
away
without
having
this
mentioned
to
him
and
he
was
conscious
of
sharing
deeply
the
hope
of
the
brethren
with
the
added
reflection
that
it
would
be
a
personal
triumph
for
himself
into
the
bargain
he
was
ashamed
of
this
feeling
a
little
later
and
of
his
trick
with
the
sermon
but
this
chastening
product
of
introspection
was
all
the
fruit
which
the
incident
bore
the
banker
never
came
again
theron
returned
one
afternoon
a
little
earlier
than
usual
from
a
group
of
pastoral
calls
alice
who
was
plucking
weeds
in
a
border
at
the
shady
side
of
the
house
heard
his
step
and
rose
from
her
labors
he
was
walking
slowly
and
seemed
weary
he
took
off
his
high
hat
as
he
saw
her
and
wiped
his
brow
the
broiling
june
sun
was
still
high
overhead
doubtless
it
was
its
insufferable
heat
which
was
accountable
for
the
worn
lines
in
his
face
and
the
spiritless
air
which
the
eye
detected
she
went
to
the
gate
and
kissed
him
as
he
entered
i
believe
if
i
were
you
she
said
i
carry
an
umbrella
such
scorching
days
as
this
nobody
think
anything
of
it
i
do
see
why
a
minister
should
carry
one
as
much
as
a
woman
carries
a
theron
gave
her
a
rueful
meditative
sort
of
smile
i
suppose
people
really
do
think
of
us
as
a
kind
of
hybrid
female
he
remarked
then
holding
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
at
finding
himself
in
the
shade
and
looked
about
him
why
you
got
more
posies
here
on
this
one
side
of
the
house
alone
than
mother
had
in
her
whole
yard
he
said
after
a
little
see
i
know
that
one
that
columbine
is
it
and
that
london
pride
and
that
ragged
robin
i
do
know
any
of
the
alice
recited
various
unfamiliar
names
as
she
pointed
out
the
several
plants
which
bore
them
and
he
listened
with
a
kindly
semblance
of
interest
they
strolled
thus
to
the
rear
of
the
house
where
thick
clumps
of
fragrant
pinks
lined
both
sides
of
the
path
she
picked
some
of
these
for
him
and
gave
him
more
names
with
which
to
label
the
considerable
number
of
other
plants
he
saw
about
him
i
had
no
idea
we
were
so
well
provided
as
all
this
he
commented
at
last
those
van
sizers
must
have
been
tremendous
hands
for
flowers
you
were
lucky
in
following
such
van
sizers
echoed
alice
with
contempt
all
they
left
was
old
tomato
cans
and
clamshells
why
i
put
in
every
blessed
one
of
these
myself
all
except
those
peonies
there
and
one
brier
on
the
side
good
for
you
exclaimed
theron
approvingly
then
it
occurred
to
him
to
ask
but
where
did
you
get
them
all
around
among
our
friends
some
few
responded
alice
with
a
note
of
hesitation
in
her
voice
sister
bult
gave
me
the
verbenas
there
and
the
white
pinks
were
a
present
from
miss
stevens
but
most
of
them
levi
gorringe
was
good
enough
to
send
me
from
his
i
did
know
that
gorringe
had
a
garden
said
theron
i
thought
he
lived
over
his
in
the
brick
block
well
i
do
know
that
it
exactly
his
explained
alice
but
it
a
big
garden
somewhere
outside
where
he
can
have
anything
he
she
went
on
with
a
little
laugh
i
did
like
to
question
him
too
closely
for
fear
he
think
i
was
looking
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth
or
else
hinting
for
more
it
was
quite
his
own
offer
you
know
he
picked
them
all
out
for
me
and
brought
them
here
and
lent
me
a
book
telling
me
just
what
to
do
with
each
one
and
in
a
few
days
now
i
am
to
have
another
big
batch
of
plants
dahlias
and
zinnias
and
asters
and
so
on
i
almost
ashamed
to
take
them
but
it
such
a
change
to
find
some
one
in
this
octavius
who
is
all
self
yes
gorringe
is
a
good
fellow
said
theron
i
wish
he
was
a
professing
then
some
new
thought
struck
him
alice
he
exclaimed
i
believe
i
go
and
see
him
this
very
afternoon
i
know
why
it
has
occurred
to
me
before
he
just
the
man
whose
advice
i
need
most
he
knows
these
people
here
he
can
tell
me
what
to
are
you
too
tired
now
suggested
alice
as
theron
put
on
his
hat
no
the
sooner
the
better
he
replied
moving
now
toward
the
gate
well
she
began
if
i
were
you
i
would
say
too
much
about
that
is
i
but
never
what
is
it
asked
her
husband
nothing
whatever
replied
alice
positively
it
was
only
some
nonsense
of
mine
and
theron
placidly
accepting
the
feminine
whim
went
off
down
the
street
again
chapter
xii
the
rev
ware
found
levi
gorringe
readily
enough
but
its
owner
was
not
in
he
probably
would
be
back
again
though
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
the
boy
said
and
the
minister
at
once
decided
to
wait
theron
was
interested
in
finding
that
this
was
no
other
than
harvey
the
lad
who
brought
milk
to
the
parsonage
every
morning
he
remembered
now
that
he
had
heard
good
things
of
this
urchin
as
to
the
hard
work
he
did
to
help
his
mother
the
widow
semple
in
her
struggle
to
keep
a
roof
over
her
head
and
also
bad
things
in
that
he
did
not
come
regularly
either
to
church
or
the
clergyman
recalled
too
that
harvey
had
impressed
him
as
a
character
well
sonny
are
you
going
to
be
a
lawyer
he
asked
as
he
seated
himself
by
the
window
and
looked
about
him
first
at
the
dusty
litter
of
old
papers
pamphlets
and
documents
in
bundles
which
crowded
the
stuffy
chamber
and
then
at
the
boy
himself
harvey
was
busy
at
a
big
box
a
rough
pine
box
which
bore
the
flaring
label
of
an
express
company
and
also
of
a
seed
firm
in
a
western
city
and
which
the
boy
had
apparently
just
opened
he
was
lifting
from
it
and
placing
on
the
table
after
he
had
shaken
off
the
sawdust
and
moss
in
which
they
were
packed
small
parcels
of
what
looked
in
the
fading
light
to
be
plants
well
i
do
know
i
rather
guess
not
he
made
answer
as
he
pursued
his
task
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
this
would
be
the
place
to
start
in
at
if
i
was
going
to
be
a
lawyer
a
boy
can
learn
here
how
to
load
cartridges
and
clean
a
gun
and
braid
on
to
leaders
but
i
do
see
much
law
laying
around
loose
anyway
he
went
on
i
could
afford
to
read
law
and
not
be
getting
any
wages
i
have
to
earn
money
you
theron
felt
that
he
liked
the
boy
yes
he
said
with
a
kindly
tone
i
heard
that
you
are
a
good
industrious
youngster
i
daresay
gorringe
will
see
to
it
that
you
get
a
chance
to
read
law
and
get
wages
oh
i
can
read
all
there
is
here
and
welcome
the
boy
explained
stepping
toward
the
window
to
decipher
the
label
on
a
bundle
of
roots
in
his
hand
but
that
no
good
unless
there
regular
practice
coming
into
the
office
all
the
while
that
how
you
learn
to
be
a
lawyer
but
gorringe
do
have
what
i
call
a
practice
at
all
he
just
sees
men
in
the
other
room
there
with
the
door
shut
and
whatever
there
is
to
do
he
does
it
all
the
minister
remembered
a
stray
hint
somewhere
that
gorringe
was
a
what
was
colloquially
called
a
to
his
rustic
sense
there
was
something
not
quite
nice
about
that
occupation
it
would
be
indecorous
he
felt
to
encourage
further
talk
about
it
from
the
boy
what
are
you
doing
there
he
inquired
to
change
the
subject
sorting
out
some
plants
replied
harvey
i
do
know
what
got
into
gorringe
lately
this
is
the
third
big
box
he
had
since
i
been
here
that
is
in
six
weeks
besides
two
baskets
full
of
i
do
know
what
he
does
with
them
he
carries
them
off
himself
somewhere
i
had
kind
of
half
a
notion
that
he
figurin
on
getting
married
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
that
would
make
a
man
spend
money
like
water
just
for
flowers
and
bushes
they
do
get
foolish
you
know
when
they
got
marriage
on
the
theron
found
himself
only
imperfectly
following
the
theories
of
the
young
philosopher
it
was
his
fact
that
monopolized
the
attention
but
as
i
understand
it
he
remarked
hesitatingly
brother
gorringe
or
rather
gorringe
gets
all
the
plants
he
wants
everything
he
likes
from
a
big
garden
somewhere
outside
i
know
that
it
is
exactly
his
but
i
remember
hearing
something
to
that
the
boy
slapped
the
last
litter
off
his
hands
and
as
he
came
to
the
window
shook
his
head
these
do
come
from
no
garden
outside
he
declared
they
come
from
the
dealers
and
he
pays
solid
cash
for
the
invoice
for
this
lot
alone
was
dollars
and
sixty
cents
there
it
is
on
the
table
you
can
see
it
for
ware
did
not
offer
to
look
very
likely
these
are
for
the
garden
i
was
speaking
of
he
said
of
course
you
ca
go
on
taking
plants
out
of
a
garden
indefinitely
without
putting
others
i
do
know
anything
about
any
garden
that
he
takes
plants
out
of
answered
harvey
and
looked
meditatively
for
a
minute
or
two
out
upon
the
street
below
then
he
turned
to
the
minister
your
wife
doing
a
good
deal
of
gardening
this
spring
i
notice
he
said
casually
hardly
think
it
was
the
same
place
she
fixed
it
up
so
if
she
wants
any
extra
hoeing
done
i
can
always
get
off
saturday
i
will
remember
said
theron
he
also
looked
out
of
the
window
and
nothing
more
was
said
until
a
few
moments
later
gorringe
himself
came
in
the
lawyer
seemed
both
surprised
and
pleased
at
discovering
the
identity
of
his
visitor
with
whom
he
shook
hands
in
almost
an
excess
of
cordiality
he
spread
a
large
newspaper
over
the
pile
of
seedling
plants
on
the
table
pushed
the
under
the
table
with
his
foot
and
said
almost
peremptorily
to
the
boy
you
can
go
now
then
he
turned
again
to
theron
well
ware
i
glad
to
see
you
he
repeated
and
drew
up
a
chair
by
the
window
things
are
going
all
right
with
you
i
theron
noted
again
the
waving
black
hair
the
dark
skin
and
the
carefully
trimmed
mustache
and
which
gave
the
lawyer
face
a
combined
effect
of
romance
and
smartness
no
it
was
the
eyes
cool
shrewd
eyes
which
suggested
this
latter
quality
the
recollection
of
having
seen
one
of
them
wink
in
deliberate
hostility
of
sarcasm
when
those
other
trustees
had
their
backs
turned
came
mercifully
at
the
moment
to
recall
the
young
minister
to
his
errand
i
thought
i
would
drop
in
and
have
a
chat
with
you
he
said
getting
better
under
way
as
he
went
on
quarterly
conference
is
only
a
fortnight
off
and
i
am
a
good
deal
at
sea
about
what
is
going
to
i
not
a
church
member
you
know
interposed
gorringe
that
shuts
me
out
of
the
quarterly
alas
yes
said
theron
i
wish
it
did
i
afraid
i
not
going
to
have
any
friends
to
spare
what
are
you
afraid
of
asked
the
lawyer
seeming
now
to
be
wholly
at
his
ease
again
they
ca
eat
no
they
keep
me
too
lean
for
that
responded
theron
with
a
pensive
smile
i
was
going
to
ask
you
know
for
an
increase
of
salary
or
an
extra
allowance
i
do
see
how
i
can
go
on
as
it
is
the
sum
fixed
by
the
last
quarterly
conference
of
the
old
year
and
which
i
am
getting
now
is
one
hundred
dollars
less
than
my
predecessor
had
that
fair
and
it
is
right
but
so
far
from
its
looking
as
if
i
could
get
an
increase
the
prospect
seems
rather
that
they
will
make
me
pay
for
the
gas
and
that
sidewalk
i
never
recovered
more
than
about
half
of
my
moving
expenses
as
you
know
and
and
frankly
i
do
know
which
way
to
turn
it
keeps
me
miserable
all
the
that
where
you
wrong
said
gorringe
if
you
let
things
like
that
worry
you
you
keep
a
sore
skin
all
your
life
you
take
my
advice
and
just
go
ahead
your
own
gait
and
let
other
folks
do
the
worrying
they
are
pretty
here
for
a
fact
but
you
can
manage
to
rub
along
somehow
if
you
should
get
into
any
real
difficulties
why
i
guess
the
lawyer
paused
to
smile
in
a
hesitating
significant
way
i
guess
some
road
out
can
be
found
all
right
the
main
thing
is
do
fret
and
do
allow
your
wife
to
to
fret
he
stopped
abruptly
theron
nodded
in
recognition
of
his
amiable
tone
and
the
found
the
nod
lengthening
itself
out
into
almost
a
bow
as
the
thought
spread
through
his
mind
that
this
had
been
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
promise
to
help
him
with
money
if
worst
came
to
worst
he
looked
at
levi
gorringe
and
said
to
himself
that
the
intuition
of
women
was
wonderful
alice
had
picked
him
out
as
a
friend
of
theirs
merely
by
seeing
him
pass
the
house
yes
he
said
i
am
specially
anxious
to
keep
my
wife
from
worrying
she
was
surrounded
in
her
girlhood
by
a
good
deal
of
what
relatively
we
should
call
luxury
and
that
makes
it
all
the
harder
for
her
to
be
a
poor
minister
wife
i
had
quite
decided
to
get
her
a
hired
girl
come
what
might
but
she
thinks
she
rather
get
on
without
one
her
health
is
better
i
must
admit
than
it
was
when
we
came
here
she
works
out
in
her
garden
a
great
deal
and
that
seems
to
agree
with
octavius
is
a
healthy
place
that
generally
admitted
replied
the
lawyer
with
indifference
he
seemed
not
to
be
interested
in
health
but
looked
intently
out
through
the
window
at
the
buildings
opposite
and
drummed
with
his
fingers
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
theron
made
haste
to
revert
to
his
errand
of
course
your
not
being
in
the
quarterly
conference
he
said
renders
certain
things
impossible
but
i
did
know
but
you
might
have
some
knowledge
of
how
matters
are
going
what
plans
the
officials
of
the
church
had
they
seem
to
have
agreed
to
tell
me
well
i
have
heard
this
much
responded
gorringe
they
figuring
on
getting
the
soulsbys
here
to
raise
the
debt
and
kind
o
shake
things
up
generally
i
guess
that
about
as
good
as
settled
had
you
heard
of
it
not
a
breath
exclaimed
theron
mournfully
well
he
added
upon
reflection
i
sorry
downright
sorry
the
seems
to
me
about
the
thing
we
produce
i
heard
of
those
soulsbys
i
think
i
saw
him
indeed
once
at
conference
but
i
believe
she
is
the
head
of
the
yes
she
wears
the
breeches
i
understand
said
gorringe
sententiously
i
had
hoped
the
young
minister
began
with
a
rueful
sigh
in
fact
i
felt
quite
confident
at
the
outset
that
i
could
pay
off
this
debt
and
put
the
church
generally
on
a
new
footing
by
giving
extra
attention
to
my
pulpit
work
it
is
hardly
for
me
to
say
it
but
in
other
places
where
i
have
been
my
preaching
has
been
rather
rather
a
feature
in
the
town
itself
i
have
always
been
accustomed
to
attract
to
our
services
a
good
many
and
that
as
you
know
helps
tremendously
from
a
money
point
of
view
but
somehow
that
has
failed
here
i
doubt
if
the
average
congregations
are
a
whit
larger
now
than
they
were
when
i
came
in
april
i
know
the
collections
are
no
commented
the
lawyer
slowly
you
never
do
anything
in
that
line
in
octavius
you
might
of
course
if
you
were
to
stay
here
and
work
hard
at
it
for
five
or
six
years
heaven
forbid
groaned
ware
quite
so
put
in
the
other
the
point
is
that
the
methodists
here
are
a
little
set
by
themselves
i
do
know
that
they
like
one
another
specially
but
i
do
know
that
they
are
not
what
you
might
call
popular
with
people
outside
now
a
new
preacher
at
the
presbyterian
church
or
even
the
baptist
he
might
have
a
chance
to
create
talk
and
make
a
stir
but
methodist
no
people
who
do
belong
wo
come
near
the
methodist
church
here
so
long
as
there
any
other
place
with
a
roof
on
it
to
go
to
give
a
dog
a
bad
name
you
know
well
the
methodists
here
have
got
a
bad
name
and
if
you
could
preach
like
henry
ward
beecher
himself
you
would
change
it
or
get
folks
to
come
and
hear
i
see
what
you
mean
theron
responded
i
not
particularly
surprised
myself
that
octavius
does
love
us
or
look
to
us
for
intellectual
stimulation
i
myself
leave
that
pulpit
more
often
than
otherwise
feeling
like
a
wet
rag
utterly
limp
and
discouraged
but
if
you
mind
my
speaking
of
it
you
do
belong
and
yet
you
it
was
evident
that
the
lawyer
did
not
mind
he
spoke
freely
in
reply
oh
yes
i
got
into
the
habit
of
it
i
began
going
when
i
first
came
here
and
and
so
it
grew
to
be
natural
for
me
to
go
then
of
course
being
the
only
lawyer
you
have
a
considerable
amount
of
my
business
is
mixed
up
in
one
way
or
another
with
your
membership
you
see
those
are
really
the
things
which
settle
a
man
in
a
rut
and
keep
him
i
suppose
your
people
were
methodists
said
theron
to
fill
in
the
pause
and
that
is
how
you
originally
started
with
levi
gorringe
shook
his
head
he
leaned
back
half
closed
his
eyes
put
his
together
and
almost
smiled
as
if
something
in
retrospect
pleased
and
moved
him
no
he
said
i
went
to
the
church
first
to
see
a
girl
who
used
to
go
there
it
was
long
before
your
time
all
her
family
moved
away
years
ago
you
would
know
any
of
them
i
was
younger
then
and
i
know
as
much
as
i
do
now
i
worshipped
the
very
ground
that
girl
walked
on
and
like
a
fool
i
never
gave
her
so
much
as
a
hint
of
it
looking
back
now
i
can
see
that
i
might
have
had
her
if
i
asked
her
but
i
went
instead
and
sat
around
and
looked
at
her
at
church
and
and
thursday
nights
and
after
the
sermon
she
was
devoted
to
religion
and
church
work
and
thinking
it
would
please
her
i
joined
the
church
on
probation
men
can
fool
themselves
easier
than
they
can
other
people
i
actually
believed
at
the
time
that
i
had
experienced
religion
i
felt
myself
full
of
all
sorts
of
awakenings
of
the
soul
and
so
forth
but
it
was
really
that
girl
you
see
i
telling
you
the
thing
just
as
it
was
i
was
very
happy
i
think
it
was
the
happiest
time
of
my
life
i
remember
there
was
a
while
i
was
on
probation
and
i
sat
down
in
front
right
beside
her
and
we
ate
the
little
square
chunks
of
bread
and
drank
the
water
together
and
i
held
one
corner
of
her
when
we
stood
up
and
sang
that
was
the
nearest
i
ever
got
to
her
or
to
full
membership
in
the
church
that
very
next
week
i
think
it
was
we
learned
that
she
had
got
engaged
to
the
minister
son
a
young
man
who
had
just
become
a
minister
himself
they
got
married
and
went
away
and
i
somehow
i
never
took
up
my
membership
when
the
six
months
probation
was
over
that
how
it
it
is
very
interesting
remarked
theron
softly
after
a
little
silence
and
very
full
of
human
well
now
you
see
said
the
lawyer
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
there
has
been
another
minister
here
since
that
i
should
have
felt
like
telling
this
story
to
they
would
have
understood
it
at
all
they
would
have
thought
it
was
blasphemy
for
me
to
say
straight
out
that
what
i
took
for
experiencing
religion
was
really
a
girl
but
you
are
different
i
felt
that
at
once
the
first
time
i
saw
you
in
a
pulpit
or
out
of
it
what
i
like
in
a
human
being
is
that
he
should
be
it
pleases
me
beyond
measure
that
you
should
like
me
then
returned
the
young
minister
with
frank
gratification
shining
on
his
face
the
world
is
made
all
the
sweeter
and
more
lovable
by
these
these
elements
of
romance
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
would
wish
to
see
them
banished
or
frowned
upon
i
do
mind
admitting
to
you
that
there
is
a
good
deal
in
methodism
i
mean
the
strict
practice
of
its
letter
which
you
find
here
in
octavius
that
is
personally
distasteful
to
me
i
read
the
other
day
of
an
english
bishop
who
said
boldly
publicly
that
no
modern
nation
could
practise
the
principles
laid
down
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
and
survive
for
ha
ha
that
good
laughed
the
lawyer
i
felt
that
it
was
good
too
pursued
theron
i
am
getting
to
see
a
great
many
things
differently
here
in
octavius
our
methodist
discipline
is
like
the
beatitudes
very
helpful
and
beautiful
if
treated
as
spiritual
suggestion
but
more
or
less
of
a
if
insisted
upon
literally
i
declare
he
added
sitting
up
in
his
chair
i
never
talked
like
this
to
a
living
soul
before
in
all
my
life
your
confidences
were
the
rev
ware
rose
as
he
spoke
and
took
up
his
hat
must
you
be
going
asked
the
lawyer
also
rising
well
i
glad
i
have
shocked
you
come
in
oftener
when
you
are
passing
and
if
you
see
anything
i
can
help
you
in
always
tell
the
two
men
shook
hands
with
an
emphatic
and
lingering
clasp
i
am
glad
said
theron
that
you
did
stop
coming
to
church
just
because
you
lost
the
levi
gorringe
answered
the
minister
pleasantry
with
a
smile
which
curled
his
mustache
upward
and
expanded
in
little
wrinkles
at
the
ends
of
his
eyes
no
he
said
jestingly
i
death
on
collecting
debts
and
i
reckon
that
the
church
still
owes
me
a
girl
i
have
one
so
with
merriment
the
echoes
of
which
pleasantly
accompanied
theron
down
the
stairway
the
two
men
parted
chapter
xiii
though
time
lagged
in
passing
with
a
slowness
which
seemed
born
of
studied
insolence
there
did
arrive
at
last
a
day
which
had
something
definitive
about
it
to
theron
disturbed
and
restless
mind
it
was
a
thursday
and
the
to
be
held
that
evening
would
be
the
last
before
the
quarterly
conference
now
only
four
days
off
for
some
reason
the
young
minister
found
himself
dwelling
upon
this
fact
and
investing
it
with
importance
but
yesterday
the
quarterly
conference
had
seemed
a
long
way
ahead
today
brought
it
alarmingly
close
to
hand
he
had
not
heretofore
regarded
the
weekly
assemblage
for
prayer
and
song
as
a
thing
calling
for
preparation
or
for
any
preliminary
thought
now
on
this
thursday
morning
he
went
to
his
desk
after
breakfast
which
was
a
sign
that
he
wanted
the
room
to
himself
quite
as
if
he
had
the
task
of
a
weighty
sermon
before
him
he
sat
at
the
desk
all
the
forenoon
doing
no
writing
it
is
true
but
remembering
every
once
in
a
while
when
his
mind
turned
aside
from
the
book
in
his
hands
that
there
was
that
in
the
evening
sometimes
he
reached
the
point
of
vaguely
wondering
why
this
strictly
commonplace
affair
should
be
forcing
itself
thus
upon
his
attention
then
with
a
kind
of
mental
shiver
at
the
recollection
that
this
was
thursday
and
that
the
great
struggle
came
on
monday
he
would
go
back
to
his
book
there
were
a
volumes
on
the
open
desk
before
him
he
had
taken
them
out
from
beneath
a
pile
of
old
advocates
and
church
magazines
where
they
had
lain
hidden
from
alice
view
most
of
the
week
if
there
had
been
a
locked
drawer
in
the
house
he
would
have
used
it
instead
to
hold
these
books
which
had
come
to
him
in
a
neat
parcel
which
also
contained
an
amiable
note
from
ledsmar
recalling
a
pleasant
evening
in
may
and
expressing
the
hope
that
the
accompanying
works
would
be
of
some
service
theron
had
glanced
at
the
backs
of
the
uppermost
two
and
discovered
that
their
author
was
renan
then
he
had
hastily
put
the
lot
in
the
best
place
he
could
think
of
to
escape
his
wife
observation
he
realized
now
that
there
had
been
no
need
for
this
secrecy
of
the
other
four
books
by
sayce
budge
smith
and
lenormant
three
indeed
revealed
themselves
to
be
published
under
religious
auspices
as
for
renan
he
might
have
known
that
the
name
would
be
meaningless
to
alice
the
feeling
that
he
himself
was
not
much
wiser
in
this
matter
than
his
wife
may
have
led
him
to
pass
over
the
learned
on
chaldean
antiquity
and
even
the
volume
of
renan
which
appeared
to
be
devoted
to
oriental
inscriptions
and
take
up
his
other
book
entitled
in
the
translation
recollections
of
my
this
he
rather
glanced
through
at
the
outset
following
with
a
certain
inattention
the
introductory
sketches
and
essays
which
dealt
with
an
unfamiliar
and
to
his
notion
somewhat
preposterous
breton
racial
type
then
little
by
little
it
dawned
upon
him
that
there
was
a
connected
story
in
all
this
and
suddenly
he
came
upon
it
out
in
the
open
as
it
were
it
was
the
story
of
how
a
deeply
devout
young
man
trained
from
his
earliest
boyhood
for
the
sacred
office
and
desiring
passionately
nothing
but
to
be
worthy
of
it
came
to
a
point
where
at
infinite
cost
of
pain
to
himself
and
of
anguish
to
those
dearest
to
him
he
had
to
declare
that
he
could
no
longer
believe
at
all
in
revealed
religion
theron
ware
read
this
all
with
an
excited
interest
which
no
book
had
ever
stirred
in
him
before
much
of
it
he
read
over
and
over
again
to
make
sure
that
he
penetrated
everywhere
the
husk
of
french
habits
of
thought
and
catholic
methods
in
which
the
kernel
was
wrapped
he
broke
off
midway
in
this
part
of
the
book
to
go
out
to
the
kitchen
to
dinner
and
began
the
meal
in
silence
to
alice
questions
he
replied
briefly
that
he
was
preparing
himself
for
the
evening
she
lifted
her
brows
in
such
frank
surprise
at
this
that
he
made
a
further
and
somewhat
rambling
explanation
about
having
again
taken
up
the
work
on
his
book
the
book
about
abraham
i
thought
you
said
you
given
that
up
altogether
she
remarked
well
he
said
i
was
discouraged
about
it
for
a
while
but
a
man
never
does
anything
big
without
getting
discouraged
over
and
over
again
while
he
doing
it
i
do
say
now
that
i
shall
write
precisely
that
book
i
merely
reading
scientific
works
about
the
period
just
now
but
if
not
that
i
shall
write
some
other
book
else
how
will
you
get
that
piano
he
added
with
an
attempt
at
a
smile
i
thought
you
had
given
that
up
too
she
replied
ruefully
then
before
he
could
speak
she
went
on
never
mind
the
piano
that
can
wait
what
i
got
on
my
mind
just
now
is
piano
it
potatoes
do
you
know
i
saw
some
the
other
day
at
rasbach
splendid
potatoes
these
are
some
of
them
and
fifteen
cents
a
bushel
cheaper
than
those
old
things
brother
barnum
keeps
and
so
i
bought
two
bushels
and
sister
barnum
met
me
on
the
street
this
morning
and
threw
it
in
my
face
that
the
discipline
commands
us
to
trade
with
each
other
is
there
any
such
command
yes
said
the
husband
it
section
do
you
remember
i
looked
it
up
in
tyre
we
are
to
our
desire
of
salvation
by
doing
good
especially
to
them
that
are
of
the
household
of
faith
or
groaning
so
to
be
by
employing
them
preferably
to
others
buying
one
of
another
helping
each
other
in
business
and
so
on
yes
it
all
well
i
told
her
i
did
believe
it
was
put
in
alice
and
i
said
that
even
if
it
was
there
ought
to
be
another
section
about
selling
potatoes
to
their
minister
for
more
than
they
worth
potatoes
that
turn
all
green
when
you
boil
them
too
i
believe
i
read
up
that
old
discipline
myself
and
see
if
it
has
got
some
things
that
i
can
talk
back
the
very
section
before
that
number
enjoins
members
against
or
unprofitable
conversation
particularly
speaking
evil
of
magistrates
or
ministers
you
have
there
i
theron
had
begun
cheerfully
enough
but
the
careworn
preoccupied
look
returned
now
to
his
face
i
sorry
if
we
fallen
out
with
the
barnums
he
said
his
davis
the
superintendent
is
a
member
of
the
quarterly
conference
you
know
and
i
been
hoping
that
he
was
on
my
side
i
been
taking
a
good
deal
of
pains
to
make
up
to
he
ended
with
a
sigh
the
pathos
of
which
impressed
alice
if
you
think
it
will
do
any
good
she
volunteered
i
go
and
call
on
the
davises
this
very
afternoon
i
sure
to
find
her
at
home
she
tied
hand
and
foot
with
that
brood
of
hers
and
you
better
give
me
some
of
that
candy
for
theron
nodded
his
approval
and
thanks
and
relapsed
into
silence
when
the
meal
was
over
he
brought
out
the
confectionery
to
his
wife
and
without
a
word
went
back
to
that
remarkable
book
when
alice
returned
toward
the
close
of
day
to
prepare
the
simple
tea
which
was
always
laid
a
earlier
on
thursdays
and
sundays
she
found
her
husband
where
she
had
left
him
still
busy
with
those
new
scientific
works
she
recounted
to
him
some
incidents
of
her
call
upon
davis
as
she
took
off
her
hat
and
put
on
the
big
kitchen
apron
how
pleased
davis
seemed
to
be
how
her
affection
for
her
the
grocer
wife
disclosed
itself
to
be
not
even
how
the
children
leaped
upon
the
candy
as
if
they
had
never
seen
any
before
and
how
in
her
belief
davis
would
be
heart
and
soul
on
theron
side
at
the
conference
to
her
surprise
the
young
minister
seemed
not
at
all
interested
he
hardly
looked
at
her
during
her
narrative
but
reclined
in
the
with
his
head
thrown
back
and
an
abstracted
gaze
wandering
aimlessly
about
the
ceiling
when
she
avowed
her
faith
in
the
superintendent
loyal
partisanship
which
she
did
with
a
pardonable
pride
in
having
helped
to
make
it
secure
her
husband
even
closed
his
eyes
and
moved
his
head
with
a
gesture
which
plainly
bespoke
indifference
i
expected
you
be
tickled
to
death
she
remarked
with
evident
disappointment
i
a
bad
headache
he
explained
after
a
minute
pause
no
wonder
alice
rejoined
sympathetically
enough
but
with
a
note
of
reproof
as
well
what
can
you
expect
staying
cooped
up
in
here
all
day
long
poring
over
those
books
people
are
all
the
while
remarking
that
you
study
too
much
i
tell
them
of
course
that
you
a
great
hand
for
reading
and
always
were
but
i
think
myself
it
would
be
better
if
you
got
out
more
and
took
more
exercise
and
saw
people
you
know
lots
and
slathers
more
than
they
do
now
or
ever
will
if
you
never
opened
another
theron
regarded
her
with
an
expression
which
she
had
never
seen
on
his
face
before
you
do
realize
what
you
are
saying
he
replied
slowly
he
sighed
as
he
added
with
increased
gravity
i
am
the
most
ignorant
man
alive
alice
began
a
little
laugh
of
wifely
incredulity
and
then
let
it
die
away
as
she
recognized
that
he
was
really
troubled
and
sad
in
his
mind
she
bent
over
to
kiss
him
lightly
on
the
brow
and
tiptoed
her
way
out
into
the
kitchen
i
believe
i
will
let
you
make
my
excuses
at
the
this
evening
he
said
all
at
once
as
the
supper
came
to
an
end
he
had
eaten
next
to
nothing
during
the
meal
and
had
sat
in
a
sort
of
from
which
alice
kindly
forbore
to
arouse
him
i
know
i
hardly
feel
equal
to
it
they
wo
take
it
amiss
for
once
if
you
explain
to
them
that
i
i
am
not
at
all
oh
i
do
hope
you
not
coming
down
with
anything
alice
had
risen
too
and
was
gazing
at
him
with
a
solicitude
the
tenderness
of
which
at
once
comforted
and
in
some
obscure
way
jarred
on
his
nerves
is
there
anything
i
can
do
or
shall
i
go
for
a
doctor
we
got
mustard
in
the
house
and
senna
i
think
there
some
senna
left
and
jamaica
theron
shook
his
head
wearily
at
her
oh
no
no
he
expostulated
it
is
anything
that
needs
drugs
or
doctors
either
it
just
mental
worry
and
fatigue
that
all
an
evening
quiet
rest
in
the
big
chair
and
early
to
bed
that
will
fix
me
up
all
but
you
read
and
that
will
make
your
head
worse
said
alice
no
i
wo
read
any
more
he
promised
her
walking
slowly
into
the
and
settling
himself
in
the
big
chair
the
while
she
brought
out
a
pillow
from
the
adjoining
best
bedroom
and
adjusted
it
behind
his
head
that
nice
i
just
lie
quiet
here
and
perhaps
doze
a
little
till
you
come
back
i
feel
in
the
mood
for
the
rest
it
will
do
me
all
sorts
of
he
closed
his
eyes
and
alice
regarding
his
upturned
face
anxiously
decided
that
already
it
looked
more
at
peace
than
awhile
ago
well
i
hope
you
be
better
when
i
get
back
she
said
as
she
began
preparations
for
the
evening
service
these
consisted
in
combing
stiffly
back
the
strands
of
hair
which
during
the
day
had
exuberantly
loosened
themselves
over
her
temples
into
something
almost
like
curls
in
fastening
down
upon
this
rebellious
hair
a
plain
bonnet
guiltless
of
all
ornament
save
a
binding
ribbon
of
dull
umber
hue
and
in
putting
on
a
thin
shawl
and
a
pair
of
equally
subdued
gloves
thus
attired
she
made
a
mischievous
little
grimace
of
dislike
at
her
puritanical
image
in
the
over
the
mantel
and
then
turned
to
announce
her
departure
well
i
off
she
said
theron
opened
his
eyes
to
take
in
this
figure
of
his
wife
dressed
for
and
then
closed
them
again
abruptly
all
right
he
murmured
and
then
he
heard
the
door
shut
behind
her
although
he
had
been
alone
all
day
there
seemed
to
be
quite
a
unique
value
and
quality
in
this
present
solitude
he
stretched
out
his
legs
on
the
opposite
chair
and
looked
lazily
about
him
with
the
feeling
that
at
last
he
had
secured
some
leisure
and
could
think
undisturbed
to
his
heart
content
there
were
nearly
two
hours
of
unbroken
quiet
before
him
and
the
mere
fact
of
his
having
stepped
aside
from
the
routine
of
his
duty
to
procure
it
marked
it
in
his
thoughts
as
a
special
occasion
which
ought
in
the
nature
of
things
to
yield
more
than
the
ordinary
harvest
of
mental
profit
theron
musings
were
broken
in
upon
from
time
to
time
by
rumbling
outbursts
of
from
the
church
next
door
surely
he
said
to
himself
there
could
be
no
other
congregation
in
the
conference
or
in
all
methodism
which
sang
so
badly
as
these
octavians
did
the
noise
as
it
came
to
him
now
and
again
divided
itself
familiarly
into
a
main
strain
of
hard
high
sharp
and
tinny
female
voices
with
three
or
four
concurrent
and
clashing
branch
strains
of
by
men
who
did
not
know
how
how
well
he
already
knew
these
voices
through
two
wooden
walls
he
could
detect
the
conceited
and
pushing
note
of
brother
lovejoy
who
tried
always
to
drown
the
rest
out
and
the
lifeless
unmeasured
weight
of
shrill
clamor
which
sister
barnum
hurled
into
every
chorus
half
closing
her
eyes
and
sticking
out
her
chin
as
she
did
so
they
drawled
their
hymns
too
these
people
till
theron
thought
he
understood
that
injunction
in
the
discipline
against
singing
too
slowly
it
had
puzzled
him
heretofore
now
he
felt
that
it
must
have
been
meant
in
prophecy
for
octavius
it
was
impossible
not
to
recall
in
contrast
that
other
church
music
he
had
heard
a
month
before
and
the
whole
atmosphere
of
that
other
pastoral
sitting
room
from
which
he
had
listened
to
it
the
startled
and
crowded
impressions
of
that
strange
evening
had
been
lying
hidden
in
his
mind
all
this
while
driven
into
a
corner
by
the
pressure
of
more
ordinary
everyday
matters
they
came
forth
now
and
passed
across
his
brain
no
longer
confusing
and
distorted
but
in
orderly
and
intelligible
sequence
their
earlier
effect
had
been
one
of
frightened
fascination
now
he
looked
them
over
calmly
as
they
lifted
themselves
one
by
one
and
found
himself
not
shrinking
at
all
or
evading
anything
but
dwelling
upon
each
in
turn
as
a
natural
and
welcome
part
of
the
most
important
experience
of
his
life
the
young
minister
had
arrived
all
at
once
at
this
conclusion
he
did
not
question
at
all
the
means
by
which
he
had
reached
it
nothing
was
clearer
to
his
mind
than
the
conclusion
itself
that
his
meeting
with
the
priest
and
the
doctor
was
the
in
his
career
they
had
lifted
him
bodily
out
of
the
slough
of
ignorance
of
contact
with
low
minds
and
sordid
narrow
things
and
put
him
on
solid
ground
this
book
he
had
been
reading
this
gentle
tender
lovable
book
which
had
as
much
true
piety
in
it
as
any
devotional
book
he
had
ever
read
and
yet
unlike
all
devotional
books
put
its
foot
firmly
upon
everything
which
could
not
be
proved
in
human
reason
to
be
true
must
be
merely
one
of
a
thousand
which
men
like
father
forbes
and
ledsmar
knew
by
heart
the
very
thought
that
he
was
on
the
way
now
to
know
them
too
made
theron
tremble
the
prospect
wooed
him
and
he
thrilled
in
response
with
the
wistful
and
delicate
eagerness
of
a
young
lover
somehow
the
fact
that
the
priest
and
the
doctor
were
not
religious
men
and
that
this
book
which
had
so
impressed
and
stirred
him
was
nothing
more
than
renan
recital
of
how
he
too
ceased
to
be
a
religious
man
did
not
take
a
form
which
theron
could
look
square
in
the
face
it
wore
the
shape
instead
of
a
vague
premise
that
there
were
a
great
many
different
kinds
of
religions
the
past
and
dead
races
had
multiplied
these
in
their
time
literally
into
thousands
and
that
each
no
doubt
had
its
central
support
of
truth
somewhere
for
the
good
men
who
were
in
it
and
that
to
call
one
of
these
divine
and
condemn
all
the
others
was
a
part
fit
only
for
untutored
bigots
renan
had
formally
repudiated
catholicism
yet
could
write
in
his
old
age
with
the
deepest
filial
affection
of
the
mother
church
he
had
quitted
father
forbes
could
talk
coolly
about
the
without
even
ceasing
to
be
a
priest
and
apparently
a
very
active
and
devoted
priest
evidently
there
was
an
intellectual
world
a
world
of
culture
and
grace
of
lofty
thoughts
and
the
inspiring
communion
of
real
knowledge
where
creeds
were
not
of
importance
and
where
men
asked
one
another
not
is
your
soul
saved
but
is
your
mind
well
furnished
theron
had
the
sensation
of
having
been
invited
to
become
a
citizen
of
this
world
the
thought
so
dazzled
him
that
his
impulses
were
dragging
him
forward
to
take
the
new
oath
of
allegiance
before
he
had
had
time
to
reflect
upon
what
it
was
he
was
abandoning
the
droning
of
the
doxology
from
the
church
outside
stirred
theron
suddenly
out
of
his
revery
it
had
grown
quite
dark
and
he
rose
and
lit
the
gas
blest
be
the
tie
that
binds
they
were
singing
he
paused
with
hand
still
in
air
to
listen
that
phrase
arrested
his
attention
and
gave
itself
a
new
meaning
he
was
bound
to
those
people
it
was
true
but
he
could
never
again
harbor
the
delusion
that
the
tie
between
them
was
blessed
there
was
vaguely
present
in
his
mind
the
consciousness
that
other
ties
were
loosening
as
well
be
that
as
it
might
one
thing
was
certain
he
had
passed
definitely
beyond
pretending
to
himself
that
there
was
anything
spiritually
in
common
between
him
and
the
methodist
church
of
octavius
the
necessity
of
his
keeping
up
the
pretence
with
others
rose
on
the
instant
like
a
looming
shadow
before
his
mental
vision
he
turned
away
from
it
and
bent
his
brain
to
think
of
something
else
the
noise
of
alice
opening
the
front
door
came
as
a
pleasant
digression
a
second
later
it
became
clear
from
the
sound
of
voices
that
she
had
brought
some
one
back
with
her
and
theron
hastily
stretched
himself
out
again
in
the
armchair
with
his
head
back
in
the
pillow
and
his
feet
on
the
other
chair
he
had
come
mighty
near
forgetting
that
he
was
an
invalid
and
he
protected
himself
the
further
now
by
assuming
an
air
of
lassitude
verging
upon
prostration
yes
there
a
light
burning
it
all
right
he
heard
alice
say
she
entered
the
room
and
theron
head
was
too
bad
to
permit
him
to
turn
it
and
see
who
her
companion
was
theron
dear
alice
began
i
knew
you
be
glad
to
see
her
even
if
you
were
out
of
sorts
and
i
persuaded
her
just
to
run
in
for
a
minute
let
me
introduce
you
to
sister
soulsby
sister
soulsby
my
the
rev
ware
sat
upright
with
an
energetic
start
and
fastened
upon
the
stranger
a
look
which
conveyed
anything
but
the
satisfaction
his
wife
had
been
so
sure
about
it
was
at
the
first
blush
an
undisguised
scowl
and
only
some
fleeting
memory
of
that
reflection
about
needing
now
to
dissemble
prevented
him
from
still
frowning
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
perfunctorily
held
out
his
hand
delighted
i
sure
he
mumbled
then
looking
up
he
discovered
that
sister
soulsby
knew
he
was
not
delighted
and
that
she
seemed
not
to
mind
in
the
least
as
your
good
lady
said
i
just
ran
in
for
a
moment
she
remarked
shaking
his
limp
hand
with
a
brisk
grasp
and
dropping
it
i
hate
bothering
sick
people
but
as
we
to
be
thrown
together
a
good
deal
this
next
week
or
so
i
thought
i
like
to
lose
no
time
in
saying
i
wo
keep
you
up
now
your
wife
has
been
sweet
enough
to
ask
me
to
move
my
trunk
over
here
in
the
morning
so
that
you
see
enough
of
me
and
to
theron
looked
falteringly
into
her
face
as
he
strove
for
words
which
should
sufficiently
mask
the
disgust
this
intelligence
stirred
within
him
a
in
the
town
was
bad
enough
a
quartered
in
the
very
parsonage
he
ground
his
teeth
to
think
of
it
alice
read
his
hesitation
aright
sister
soulsby
went
to
the
hotel
she
hastily
put
in
and
loren
pierce
was
after
her
to
come
and
stay
at
his
house
and
i
ventured
to
tell
her
that
i
thought
we
could
make
her
more
comfortable
she
accompanied
this
by
so
daring
a
grimace
and
nod
that
her
husband
woke
up
to
the
fact
that
a
point
in
conference
politics
was
involved
he
squeezed
a
doubtful
smile
upon
his
features
we
shall
both
do
our
best
he
said
it
was
not
easy
but
he
forced
increasing
amiability
into
his
glance
and
tone
is
brother
soulsby
here
too
he
asked
the
shook
her
head
again
the
prompt
decisive
movement
so
like
a
busy
man
of
affairs
no
she
answered
he
doing
supply
down
on
the
hudson
this
week
but
he
be
here
in
time
for
the
sunday
morning
i
always
like
to
come
on
ahead
and
see
how
the
land
lies
well
your
head
will
be
all
right
in
the
precisely
what
she
meant
by
this
assurance
theron
did
not
attempt
to
guess
he
received
her
adieu
noted
the
masterful
manner
in
which
she
kissed
his
wife
and
watched
her
pass
out
into
the
hall
with
the
feeling
uppermost
that
this
was
a
person
who
decidedly
knew
her
way
about
much
as
he
was
prepared
to
dislike
her
and
much
as
he
detested
the
vulgar
methods
her
profession
typified
he
could
not
deny
that
she
seemed
a
very
capable
sort
of
woman
this
mental
concession
did
not
prevent
his
fixing
upon
alice
when
she
returned
to
the
room
a
glance
of
obvious
disapproval
theron
she
broke
forth
to
anticipate
his
reproach
i
did
it
for
the
best
the
pierces
would
have
got
her
if
i
had
cut
in
i
thought
it
would
help
to
have
her
on
our
side
and
besides
i
like
her
she
the
first
sister
i
seen
since
we
been
in
this
hole
that
had
a
kind
word
for
me
or
or
sympathized
with
me
and
and
if
you
going
to
be
offended
i
shall
cry
there
were
real
tears
on
her
lashes
ready
to
make
good
the
threat
oh
i
guess
i
would
said
theron
with
an
approach
to
his
old
manner
if
you
like
her
that
the
chief
alice
shook
her
away
no
she
replied
with
a
wistful
smile
the
chief
thing
is
to
have
her
like
you
she
as
smart
as
a
steel
trap
that
woman
is
and
if
she
took
the
notion
i
believe
she
could
help
get
us
a
better
chapter
xiv
the
ensuing
week
went
by
with
a
buzz
and
whirl
circling
about
theron
ware
dizzy
consciousness
like
some
huge
impalpable
teetotum
sent
spinning
under
sister
soulsby
resolute
hands
whenever
his
vagrant
memory
recurred
to
it
in
after
months
he
began
by
marvelling
and
ended
with
a
shudder
of
repulsion
it
was
a
week
crowded
with
events
which
seemed
to
him
to
shoot
past
so
swiftly
that
in
effect
they
came
all
of
a
heap
he
never
essayed
the
task
in
retrospect
of
arranging
them
in
their
order
of
sequence
they
had
however
a
definite
and
interdependent
chronology
which
it
is
worth
the
while
to
trace
soulsby
brought
her
trunk
round
to
the
parsonage
bright
and
early
on
friday
morning
and
took
up
her
lodgement
in
the
best
bedroom
and
her
headquarters
in
the
house
at
large
with
a
cheerful
and
manner
she
desired
nothing
so
much
she
said
as
that
people
should
not
put
themselves
out
on
her
account
or
allow
her
to
get
in
their
way
she
appeared
to
mean
this
too
and
to
have
very
good
ideas
about
securing
its
realization
during
both
friday
and
the
following
day
indeed
theron
saw
her
only
at
the
family
meals
there
she
displayed
a
hearty
relish
for
all
that
was
set
before
her
which
quite
won
ware
heart
and
though
she
talked
rather
more
than
theron
found
himself
expecting
from
a
woman
he
could
not
deny
that
her
conversation
was
both
seemly
and
entertaining
she
had
evidently
been
a
great
traveller
and
referred
to
things
she
had
seen
in
savannah
or
montreal
or
los
angeles
in
as
fashion
as
he
could
have
spoken
of
a
visit
to
tecumseh
theron
asked
her
many
questions
about
these
and
other
cities
and
her
answers
were
all
so
pat
and
showed
so
keen
and
clear
an
eye
that
he
began
in
spite
of
himself
to
think
of
her
with
a
certain
admiration
she
in
turn
plied
him
with
inquiries
about
the
principal
and
members
of
his
congregation
their
means
their
disposition
and
the
measure
of
their
devotion
she
put
these
queries
with
such
intelligence
and
seemed
to
assimilate
his
replies
with
such
an
alert
understanding
that
the
young
minister
was
spurred
to
put
dashes
of
character
in
his
descriptions
and
set
forth
the
idiosyncrasies
and
distinguishing
earmarks
of
his
flock
with
what
he
felt
afterward
might
have
been
too
free
a
tongue
but
at
the
time
her
fine
air
of
appreciation
led
him
captive
he
gossiped
about
his
parishioners
as
if
he
enjoyed
it
he
made
a
specially
happy
sketch
for
her
of
one
of
his
trustees
erastus
winch
the
ostentatiously
jovial
and
really
she
was
particularly
interested
in
hearing
about
this
man
the
personality
of
winch
seemed
to
have
impressed
her
and
she
brought
the
talk
back
to
him
more
than
once
and
prompted
theron
to
the
very
threshold
of
indiscretion
in
his
confidences
on
the
subject
save
at
sister
soulsby
spent
the
two
days
out
around
among
the
methodists
of
octavius
she
had
little
or
nothing
to
say
about
what
she
thus
saw
and
heard
but
used
it
as
the
basis
for
still
further
inquiries
she
told
more
than
once
however
of
how
she
had
been
pressed
here
or
there
to
stay
to
dinner
or
supper
and
how
she
had
excused
herself
i
knocked
about
too
much
she
would
explain
to
the
wares
not
to
fight
shy
of
random
country
cooking
when
i
find
such
a
born
cook
as
you
are
well
i
know
when
i
well
alice
flushed
with
pleased
pride
at
this
and
theron
himself
felt
that
their
visitor
showed
great
good
sense
by
saturday
noon
the
two
women
were
calling
each
other
by
their
first
names
theron
learned
with
a
certain
interest
that
sister
soulsby
christian
name
was
candace
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
give
even
more
thought
to
her
than
to
her
quaint
and
unfamiliar
old
ethiopian
name
she
was
undoubtedly
a
very
smart
woman
to
his
surprise
she
had
never
introduced
in
her
talk
any
of
the
stock
religious
and
devotional
phrases
which
official
methodists
so
universally
employed
in
mutual
converse
she
might
have
been
an
insurance
agent
or
a
visiting
in
a
purely
secular
household
so
little
parade
of
cant
was
there
about
her
he
caught
himself
wondering
how
old
she
was
she
seemed
to
have
been
pretty
well
over
the
whole
american
continent
and
that
must
take
years
of
time
perhaps
however
the
exertion
of
so
much
travel
would
tend
to
age
one
in
appearance
her
eyes
were
still
youthful
decidedly
wise
eyes
but
still
juvenile
they
had
sparkled
with
almost
girlish
merriment
at
some
of
his
jokes
she
turned
them
about
a
good
deal
when
she
spoke
making
their
glances
fit
and
illustrate
the
things
she
said
he
had
never
met
any
one
whose
eyes
played
so
constant
and
prominent
a
part
in
their
owner
conversation
theron
had
never
seen
a
play
but
he
had
encountered
the
portraits
of
famous
queens
of
the
drama
several
times
in
illustrated
papers
or
shop
windows
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
some
of
the
more
marked
contortions
of
sister
soulsby
eyes
notably
a
trick
she
had
of
rolling
them
swiftly
round
and
plunging
them
so
to
speak
into
an
intent
yearning
one
might
almost
say
devouring
gaze
at
the
speaker
were
probably
employed
by
eminent
actresses
like
ristori
and
fanny
davenport
the
rest
of
sister
soulsby
was
undoubtedly
subordinated
in
interest
to
those
eyes
of
hers
sometimes
her
face
seemed
to
be
reviving
temporarily
a
comeliness
which
had
been
constant
in
former
days
then
again
it
would
look
decidedly
organically
plain
it
was
the
worn
and
face
of
a
nervous
woman
who
had
had
more
than
her
share
of
trouble
and
drank
too
much
tea
she
wore
the
collar
of
her
dress
rather
low
and
theron
found
himself
wondering
at
this
because
though
long
and
expansive
her
neck
certainly
showed
more
cords
and
cavities
than
consorted
with
his
vague
ideal
of
statuesque
beauty
then
he
wondered
at
himself
for
thinking
about
it
and
abruptly
reined
up
his
fancy
only
to
find
that
it
was
playing
with
speculations
as
to
whether
her
yellowish
complexion
was
due
to
that
or
came
to
her
as
a
legacy
of
southern
blood
he
knew
that
she
was
born
in
the
south
because
she
said
so
from
the
same
source
he
learned
that
her
father
had
been
a
wealthy
planter
who
was
ruined
by
the
war
and
sank
into
a
premature
grave
under
the
weight
of
his
accumulated
losses
the
large
dark
rings
around
her
eyes
grew
deeper
still
in
their
shadows
when
she
told
about
this
and
her
ordinarily
sharp
voice
took
on
a
mellow
cadence
with
a
soft
drawling
accent
turning
u
into
o
and
having
no
r
to
speak
of
theron
had
imbibed
somewhere
in
early
days
the
conviction
that
the
south
was
the
land
of
romance
of
cavaliers
and
gallants
and
black
eyes
flashing
behind
mantillas
and
outspread
fans
and
somehow
when
sister
soulsby
used
this
intonation
she
suggested
all
these
things
but
almost
all
her
talk
was
in
another
key
a
brisk
direct
idiomatic
manner
of
speech
with
an
intonation
hinting
at
no
section
in
particular
it
was
merely
that
of
the
as
distinguished
from
the
rustic
she
was
of
about
alice
height
perhaps
a
shade
taller
it
did
not
escape
the
attention
of
the
wares
that
she
wore
clothes
of
a
more
stylish
cut
and
a
livelier
arrangement
of
hues
than
any
alice
had
ever
dared
own
even
in
tyre
the
two
talked
of
this
in
their
room
on
friday
night
and
theron
explained
that
congregations
would
tolerate
things
of
this
sort
with
a
stranger
which
would
be
sharply
resented
in
the
case
of
local
folk
whom
they
controlled
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
alice
in
turn
told
theron
she
was
sure
soulsby
had
false
teeth
a
confidence
which
she
immediately
regretted
as
an
act
of
treachery
to
her
sex
on
saturday
afternoon
toward
evening
brother
soulsby
arrived
and
was
guided
to
the
parsonage
by
his
wife
who
had
gone
to
the
depot
to
meet
him
they
must
have
talked
over
the
situation
pretty
thoroughly
on
the
way
for
by
the
time
the
had
washed
his
face
and
hands
and
put
on
a
clean
collar
sister
soulsby
was
ready
to
announce
her
plan
of
campaign
in
detail
her
husband
was
a
man
of
small
stature
and
like
herself
of
uncertain
age
he
had
a
gentle
if
rather
dry
face
and
wore
his
hair
long
behind
his
little
figure
was
clad
in
black
clothes
of
a
distinctively
clerical
fashion
and
he
had
a
white
neatly
tied
under
his
collar
the
wares
noted
that
he
looked
clean
and
amiable
rather
than
intellectually
or
spiritually
powerful
as
he
took
the
vacant
seat
between
theirs
and
joined
them
in
concentrating
attention
upon
soulsby
this
lady
holding
herself
erect
and
alert
on
the
edge
of
the
low
big
had
the
air
of
presiding
over
a
meeting
my
idea
is
she
began
with
an
easy
implication
that
no
one
idea
was
needed
that
your
quarterly
conference
when
it
meets
on
monday
must
be
adjourned
to
tuesday
we
will
have
the
people
all
out
tomorrow
morning
to
and
announcement
can
be
made
there
and
at
the
morning
service
afterward
that
a
series
of
revival
meetings
are
to
be
begun
that
same
evening
soulsby
and
i
can
take
charge
in
the
evening
and
we
see
to
it
that
that
packs
the
house
fills
the
church
to
overflowing
monday
evening
then
we
quietly
turn
the
meeting
into
a
convention
before
they
know
where
they
are
and
wipe
off
the
best
part
of
the
load
now
do
you
see
she
turned
her
eyes
full
upon
theron
as
she
spoke
you
want
to
hold
your
quarterly
conference
after
this
money
been
raised
not
i
see
what
you
mean
ware
responded
gravely
but
but
what
sister
soulsby
interjected
with
vivacity
well
said
theron
picking
his
words
in
the
first
place
it
rests
with
the
presiding
elder
to
say
whether
an
adjournment
can
be
made
until
tuesday
not
with
that
all
right
leave
that
to
me
said
the
lady
in
the
second
place
theron
went
on
still
more
hesitatingly
there
seems
a
certain
what
shall
i
say
indirection
in
in
in
getting
them
together
for
a
revival
and
springing
a
on
them
sister
soulsby
put
in
why
man
alive
that
the
best
part
of
it
you
ought
to
be
getting
some
notion
by
this
time
what
these
octavius
folks
of
yours
are
like
i
only
been
here
two
days
but
i
got
their
measure
down
to
an
allspice
supposing
you
were
to
announce
tomorrow
that
the
debt
was
to
be
raised
monday
how
many
men
with
would
turn
up
do
you
think
you
could
put
them
all
in
your
eye
sir
all
in
your
eye
very
possibly
you
right
faltered
the
young
minister
right
why
of
course
i
right
she
said
with
placid
confidence
you
got
to
take
folks
as
you
find
them
and
you
got
to
find
them
the
best
way
you
can
one
place
can
be
worked
managed
in
one
way
and
another
needs
quite
a
different
way
and
both
ways
would
be
dead
frosts
complete
failures
in
a
brother
soulsby
coughed
softly
here
and
shuffled
his
feet
for
an
instant
on
the
carpet
his
wife
resumed
her
remarks
with
slightly
abated
animation
and
at
a
slower
pace
my
experience
she
said
has
shown
me
that
the
apostle
was
right
to
properly
serve
the
cause
one
must
be
all
things
to
all
men
i
have
known
very
queer
things
indeed
turn
out
to
be
means
of
grace
you
simply
ca
get
along
without
some
of
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
we
are
commanded
to
have
it
for
that
matter
and
now
speaking
of
that
do
you
know
when
the
presiding
elder
arrives
in
town
today
and
where
he
is
going
to
eat
supper
and
sleep
theron
shook
his
head
all
i
know
is
he
is
likely
to
come
here
he
said
and
added
sadly
i
afraid
he
not
an
admirer
of
perhaps
that
not
all
his
fault
commented
sister
soulsby
i
tell
you
something
he
came
in
on
the
same
train
as
my
husband
and
that
old
trustee
pierce
of
yours
was
waiting
for
him
with
his
buggy
and
i
saw
like
a
flash
what
was
in
the
wind
and
the
minute
the
train
stopped
i
caught
the
presiding
elder
and
invited
him
in
your
name
to
come
right
here
and
stay
told
him
you
and
alice
were
just
set
on
his
coming
would
take
no
for
an
answer
of
course
he
could
come
i
knew
well
enough
he
had
promised
old
pierce
but
we
got
in
our
invitation
anyway
and
it
wo
do
you
any
harm
now
that
what
i
call
having
some
gumption
wisdom
of
the
serpent
and
so
i
sure
remarked
alice
i
should
have
been
mortified
to
death
if
he
had
come
we
lost
the
to
our
table
in
moving
and
four
is
all
it
seat
sister
soulsby
smiled
winningly
into
the
wife
honest
face
do
you
see
dear
she
explained
patiently
i
only
asked
him
because
i
knew
he
could
come
a
little
butter
spreads
a
long
way
if
it
only
intelligently
it
was
certainly
very
ingenious
of
you
theron
began
almost
stiffly
then
he
yielded
to
the
humanities
and
with
a
kindling
smile
added
and
it
was
as
kind
as
kind
could
be
i
afraid
you
wrong
about
it
doing
me
any
good
but
i
can
see
how
well
you
meant
it
and
we
could
have
sneaked
in
the
kitchen
table
perhaps
while
he
was
out
in
the
garden
and
put
on
the
extra
long
tablecloth
interjected
alice
musingly
sister
soulsby
smiled
again
at
sister
ware
but
without
any
words
this
time
and
alice
on
the
instant
rose
with
the
remark
that
she
must
be
going
out
to
see
about
supper
i
going
to
insist
on
coming
out
to
help
you
soulsby
declared
as
soon
as
i
talked
over
one
little
matter
with
your
husband
oh
yes
you
must
let
me
this
time
i
insist
as
the
kitchen
door
closed
behind
ware
a
swift
and
apparently
significant
glance
shot
its
way
across
from
sister
soulsby
roving
eloquent
eyes
to
the
calmer
and
smaller
gray
orbs
of
her
husband
he
rose
to
his
feet
made
some
little
explanation
about
being
a
gardener
himself
and
desiring
to
inspect
more
closely
some
rhododendrons
he
had
noticed
in
the
garden
and
forthwith
moved
decorously
out
by
the
other
door
into
the
front
hall
they
heard
his
footsteps
on
the
gravel
beneath
the
window
before
soulsby
spoke
again
you
right
about
the
presiding
elder
and
you
wrong
she
said
he
is
what
one
might
call
precisely
in
love
with
you
oh
i
know
the
story
how
you
got
into
debt
at
tyre
and
he
stepped
in
and
insisted
on
your
being
denied
tecumseh
and
sent
here
he
was
responsible
for
that
then
was
he
broke
in
theron
with
contracted
brows
why
do
you
make
any
effort
to
find
out
anything
at
all
she
asked
pertly
enough
but
with
such
obvious
that
he
could
not
but
have
pleasure
in
her
speech
why
of
course
he
did
it
who
else
did
you
suppose
well
said
the
young
minister
despondently
if
he
as
much
against
me
as
all
that
i
might
as
well
hang
up
my
fiddle
and
go
sister
soulsby
gave
a
little
involuntary
groan
of
impatience
she
bent
forward
and
lifting
her
eyes
rolled
them
at
him
in
a
curve
of
downward
motion
which
suggested
to
his
fancy
the
image
of
two
eagles
in
a
concerted
pounce
upon
a
lamb
my
friend
she
began
with
a
new
note
of
impressiveness
in
her
voice
if
you
pardon
my
saying
it
you
have
got
the
spunk
of
a
mouse
if
you
going
to
lay
down
and
let
everybody
trample
over
you
just
as
they
please
you
right
you
might
as
well
go
home
but
now
here
this
is
what
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
do
you

hands

next
few
days
and
leave
this
whole
thing
to
me
i
pull
it
into
shipshape
for
you
no
wait
a
minute
do
interrupt
now
i
have
taken
a
liking
to
you

got
brains
and
you
got
human
nature
in
you
and
heart
what
you
lack
is
sabe

that
too
in
time
and
meanwhile

good
honest
little
soul
and
she
worships
the
very
ground

tread
on
of
course
as
long
as
people
will
marry
in
their
teens
the
wrong
people
will
get
yoked
up
together
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
she
a
kind
sweet
little
body
and
she
devoted
to
you
and
it
is
every
intellectual
man
that
gets
even
that
much
but
now
it
a
go
is
it
you
promise
to
keep
quiet
do
you
and
leave
the
whole
show
absolutely
to
me
shake
hands
on
sister
soulsby
had
risen
and
stood
now
holding
out
her
hand
in
a
frank
manly
fashion
theron
looked
at
the
hand
and
made
mental
notes
that
there
were
a
good
many
veins
discernible
on
the
small
wrist
and
that
the
forearm
seemed
to
swell
out
more
than
would
have
been
expected
in
a
woman
producing
such
a
general
effect
of
leanness
he
caught
the
shine
of
a
thin
of
gold
under
the
sleeve
a
delicate
significant
odor
just
hinted
its
presence
in
the
air
about
this
outstretched
arm
something
which
was
not
a
perfume
yet
deserved
as
gracious
a
name
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
took
the
proffered
hand
with
a
deliberate
gesture
as
if
he
had
been
cautiously
weighing
all
the
possible
arguments
for
and
against
this
momentous
compact
i
promise
he
said
gravely
and
the
two
palms
squeezed
themselves
together
in
an
earnest
clasp
right
you
are
exclaimed
the
lady
once
more
with
cheery
vivacity
mind
when
it
all
over
i
going
to
give
you
a
good
serious
downright
talking
to
a
regular
i
not
sure
i
sha
give
you
a
sound
shaking
into
the
bargain
you
need
it
and
now
i
going
out
to
help
the
reverend
ware
remained
standing
after
his
new
friend
had
left
the
room
and
his
meditative
face
wore
an
even
unusual
air
of
abstraction
he
strolled
aimlessly
over
after
a
time
to
the
desk
by
the
window
and
stood
there
looking
out
at
the
slight
figure
of
brother
soulsby
who
was
bending
over
and
attentively
regarding
some
pink
blossoms
on
a
shrub
through
what
seemed
to
be
a
pocket
what
remained
uppermost
in
his
mind
was
not
this
interesting
confident
pledge
of
championship
in
his
material
difficulties
he
found
himself
dwelling
instead
upon
her
remark
about
the
incongruous
results
of
early
marriages
he
wondered
idly
if
the
little
man
in
the
white
tie
fussing
out
there
over
that
had
figured
in
her
thoughts
as
an
example
of
these
evils
then
he
reflected
that
they
had
been
mentioned
in
clear
relation
to
talk
about
alice
now
that
he
faced
this
question
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
consciously
ignoring
and
putting
it
aside
for
a
long
time
how
was
it
he
asked
himself
now
that
alice
who
had
once
seemed
so
bright
and
who
had
in
truth
started
out
immeasurably
his
superior
in
swiftness
of
apprehension
and
readiness
in
humorous
quips
and
conceits
should
have
grown
so
dull
for
she
was
undoubtedly
slow
to
understand
things
nowadays
her
absurd
lugging
in
of
the
problem
when
the
great
strategic
point
of
that
invitation
foisted
upon
the
presiding
elder
came
up
was
only
the
latest
sample
of
a
score
of
these
exhibitions
that
recalled
themselves
to
him
and
outsiders
were
apparently
beginning
to
notice
it
he
knew
by
intuition
what
those
phrases
good
honest
little
soul
and
kind
sweet
little
body
signified
when
another
woman
used
them
to
a
husband
about
his
wife
the
very
employment
of
that
word
little
was
enough
considering
that
there
was
scarcely
more
than
a
hair
difference
between
soulsby
and
alice
and
that
they
were
both
rather
tall
than
otherwise
as
the
stature
of
women
went
what
she
had
said
about
the
chronic
misfortunes
of
intellectual
men
in
such
matters
gave
added
point
to
those
meaning
phrases
nobody
could
deny
that
geniuses
and
men
of
conspicuous
talent
had
as
a
rule
all
through
history
contracted
unfortunate
marriages
in
almost
every
case
where
their
wives
were
remembered
at
all
it
was
on
account
of
their
abnormal
stupidity
or
bad
temper
or
something
of
that
sort
take
xantippe
for
example
and
shakespeare
wife
and
and
well
there
was
byron
and
and
ever
so
many
others
of
course
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
about
it
these
things
happened
and
one
could
only
put
the
best
possible
face
on
them
and
live
appointed
life
as
patiently
and
contentedly
as
might
be
and
alice
undoubtedly
merited
all
the
praise
which
had
been
so
generously
bestowed
upon
her
she
was
good
and
honest
and
kindly
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
her
utter
devotion
to
him
these
were
tangible
solid
qualities
which
must
always
secure
respect
for
her
it
was
true
that
she
no
longer
seemed
to
be
very
popular
among
people
he
questioned
whether
men
for
instance
like
father
forbes
and
ledsmar
would
care
much
about
her
visions
of
the
wifeless
and
academic
calm
in
which
these
men
spent
their
lives
an
existence
consecrated
to
literature
and
knowledge
and
familiarity
with
all
the
loftiest
and
noblest
thoughts
of
the
past
rose
and
enveloped
him
in
a
cloud
of
depression
no
such
lot
would
be
his
he
must
labor
along
among
ignorant
and
spiteful
people
to
the
end
of
his
days
pocketing
their
insults
and
fawning
upon
the
harsh
hands
of
jealous
nonentities
who
happened
to
be
his
official
masters
just
to
keep
a
roof
over
his
head
or
rather
alice
he
must
sacrifice
everything
to
this
his
ambitions
his
passionate
desires
to
do
real
good
in
the
world
on
a
large
scale
his
mental
freedom
yes
even
his
chance
of
having
truly
elevating
intellectual
friendships
for
it
was
plain
enough
that
the
men
whose
friendship
would
be
of
genuine
and
stimulating
profit
to
him
would
not
like
her
now
that
he
thought
of
it
she
seemed
latterly
to
make
no
friends
at
all
suddenly
as
he
watched
in
a
blank
sort
of
way
brother
soulsby
take
out
a
penknife
and
lop
an
offending
twig
from
a
against
the
fence
something
occurred
to
him
there
was
a
curious
exception
to
that
rule
of
alice
isolation
she
had
made
at
least
one
friend
levi
gorringe
seemed
to
like
her
extremely
as
if
his
mind
had
been
a
camera
theron
snapped
a
shutter
down
upon
this
odd
unbidden
idea
and
turned
away
from
the
window
the
sounds
of
an
active
almost
strenuous
conversation
in
female
voices
came
from
the
kitchen
theron
opened
the
door
noiselessly
and
put
in
his
head
conscious
of
something
furtive
in
his
intention
you
must
dreen
every
drop
of
water
off
the
spinach
mind
before
you
put
it
over
or
else
it
was
sister
soulsby
sharp
and
penetrating
tones
which
came
to
him
theron
closed
the
door
again
and
surrendered
himself
once
more
to
the
circling
whirl
of
his
thoughts
chapter
xv
a
at
nine
in
the
morning
opened
the
public
services
of
a
sunday
still
memorable
in
the
annals
of
octavius
methodism
this
ceremony
which
four
times
a
year
preceded
the
sessions
of
the
quarterly
conference
was
not
necessarily
an
event
of
importance
it
was
an
occasion
upon
which
the
brethren
and
sisters
who
clung
to
the
primitive
ways
of
the
itinerant
let
themselves
go
with
emphasized
independence
putting
up
more
vehement
prayers
than
usual
and
adding
a
special
fervor
of
noise
to
their
amens
and
other
interjections
and
that
was
all
it
was
theron
first
in
octavius
and
as
the
big
in
the
church
basement
began
to
fill
up
and
he
noted
how
the
men
with
ultra
radical
views
and
the
women
clad
in
the
most
ostentatious
drabs
and
grays
were
crowding
into
the
front
seats
he
felt
his
spirits
sinking
he
had
literally
to
force
himself
from
sentence
to
sentence
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
rise
and
open
the
proceedings
with
an
exhortation
he
had
eagerly
offered
this
function
to
the
presiding
elder
the
rev
aziel
larrabee
who
sat
in
severe
silence
on
the
little
platform
behind
him
but
had
been
informed
that
the
dignitary
would
lead
off
in
giving
testimony
later
on
so
theron
feeling
all
the
while
the
hostile
eyes
of
the
elder
burning
holes
in
his
back
dragged
himself
somehow
through
the
task
he
had
never
known
any
such
difficulty
of
speech
before
the
relief
was
almost
overwhelming
when
he
came
to
the
customary
part
where
all
are
adjured
to
be
as
brief
as
possible
in
witnessing
for
the
lord
because
the
time
belongs
to
all
the
people
and
the
discipline
forbids
the
feast
to
last
more
than
ninety
minutes
he
delivered
this
injunction
to
brevity
with
marked
earnestness
and
then
sat
down
abruptly
there
was
some
rather
boisterous
singing
during
which
the
stewards
beginning
with
the
platform
passed
plates
of
bread
cut
in
small
cubes
and
water
in
big
plated
pitchers
and
tumblers
about
among
the
congregation
threading
their
way
between
the
long
wooden
benches
ordinarily
occupied
at
this
hour
by
the
children
of
the
and
helping
each
brother
and
sister
in
turn
they
held
by
the
old
custom
here
in
octavius
and
all
along
the
seats
the
sexes
alternated
as
they
do
at
a
polite
theron
impassively
watched
the
familiar
scene
the
early
nervousness
had
passed
away
he
felt
now
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
these
people
even
with
the
presiding
elder
thrown
in
folks
who
sang
with
such
unintelligence
and
who
threw
themselves
with
such
undignified
fervor
into
this
childish
business
of
the
bread
and
water
could
not
be
formidable
antagonists
for
a
man
of
intellect
he
had
never
realized
before
what
a
spectacle
the
methodist
probably
presented
to
outsiders
what
must
they
think
of
it
he
had
noticed
that
the
soulsbys
sat
together
in
the
centre
and
toward
the
front
next
to
brother
soulsby
sat
alice
he
thought
she
looked
pale
and
preoccupied
and
set
it
down
in
passing
to
her
innate
distaste
for
the
somber
garments
she
was
wearing
and
for
the
company
she
perforce
found
herself
in
another
head
was
in
the
way
and
for
a
time
theron
did
not
observe
who
sat
beside
alice
on
the
other
side
when
at
last
he
saw
that
it
was
levi
gorringe
his
instinct
was
to
wonder
what
the
lawyer
must
be
saying
to
himself
about
these
noisy
and
shallow
enthusiasts
a
recurring
emotion
of
loyalty
to
the
simple
people
among
whom
after
all
he
had
lived
his
whole
life
prompted
him
to
feel
that
it
was
wholly
nice
of
gorringe
to
come
and
enjoy
this
revelation
of
their
foolish
side
as
if
it
were
a
circus
there
was
some
vague
memory
in
his
mind
which
associated
gorringe
with
other
and
with
a
cynical
attitude
toward
them
oh
yes
he
had
told
how
he
went
to
one
just
for
the
sake
of
sitting
beside
the
girl
he
admired
and
was
pursuing
the
stewards
had
completed
their
round
and
the
loud
discordant
singing
came
to
an
end
there
ensued
a
little
pause
during
which
theron
turned
to
the
presiding
elder
with
a
gesture
of
invitation
to
take
charge
of
the
further
proceedings
the
elder
responded
with
another
gesture
calling
his
attention
to
something
going
on
in
front
brother
and
sister
soulsby
to
the
considerable
surprise
of
everybody
had
risen
to
their
feet
and
were
standing
in
their
places
quite
motionless
and
with
an
air
of
professional
dimly
discernible
under
a
large
show
of
humility
they
stood
thus
until
complete
silence
had
been
secured
then
the
woman
lifting
her
head
began
to
sing
the
words
were
rock
of
ages
but
no
one
present
had
heard
the
tune
to
which
she
wedded
them
her
voice
was
full
and
very
sweet
and
had
in
it
tender
cadences
which
all
her
hearers
found
touching
she
knew
how
to
sing
and
she
put
forth
the
words
so
that
each
was
distinctly
intelligible
there
came
a
part
where
brother
soulsby
lifting
his
head
in
turn
took
up
a
tuneful
second
to
her
air
although
the
two
did
not
as
one
could
hear
by
listening
closely
sing
the
same
words
at
the
same
time
they
produced
none
the
less
most
moving
and
delightful
harmonies
of
sound
the
experience
was
so
novel
and
charming
that
listeners
ran
ahead
in
their
minds
to
fix
the
number
of
verses
there
were
in
the
hymn
and
to
hope
that
none
would
be
left
out
toward
the
end
when
some
of
the
intolerably
local
singers
fancying
they
had
caught
the
tune
started
to
join
in
they
were
stopped
by
an
indignant
which
rose
from
all
parts
of
the
and
the
soulsbys
with
a
patient
and
pensive
kindliness
written
on
their
uplifted
faces
gave
that
verse
over
again
what
followed
seemed
obviously
restrained
and
modified
by
the
effect
of
this
and
tranquillizing
overture
the
presiding
elder
was
known
to
enjoy
visits
to
congregations
like
that
of
octavius
where
he
could
indulge
to
the
full
his
inner
passion
for
passionate
invocations
and
violent
spiritual
demeanor
but
this
time
he
spoke
temperately
almost
soothingly
the
most
tempestuous
of
the
local
witnesses
for
the
lord
gave
in
their
testimony
in
relatively
pacific
tones
under
the
influence
of
the
spell
which
good
music
had
laid
upon
the
gathering
there
was
the
deepest
interest
as
to
what
the
two
visitors
would
do
in
this
way
brother
soulsby
spoke
first
very
briefly
and
in
well
rounded
and
if
conventional
phrases
his
wife
following
him
delivered
in
a
melodious
monotone
some
equally
hackneyed
remarks
the
assemblage
listening
in
rapt
attention
felt
the
suggestion
of
reserved
power
in
every
sentence
she
uttered
and
burst
forth
as
she
dropped
into
her
seat
in
a
loud
chorus
of
approving
ejaculations
the
soulsbys
had
captured
octavius
with
their
first
outer
skirmish
line
everything
seemed
to
move
forward
now
with
a
new
zest
and
spontaneity
theron
had
picked
out
for
the
occasion
the
best
of
those
sermons
which
he
had
prepared
in
tyre
at
the
time
when
he
was
justifying
his
ambition
to
be
accounted
a
pulpit
orator
it
was
orthodox
enough
but
had
been
planned
as
the
framework
for
picturesque
and
emotional
rhetoric
rather
than
doctrinal
edification
he
had
never
dreamed
of
trying
it
on
octavius
before
and
only
on
the
yesterday
had
quavered
at
his
own
daring
in
choosing
it
now
nothing
but
the
desire
to
show
sister
soulsby
what
was
in
him
had
held
him
to
the
selection
something
of
this
same
desire
no
doubt
swayed
and
steadied
him
now
in
the
pulpit
the
labored
slowness
of
his
beginning
seemed
to
him
to
be
due
to
nervous
timidity
until
suddenly
looking
down
into
those
big
eyes
of
sister
soulsby
which
were
bent
gravely
upon
him
from
where
she
sat
beside
alice
in
the
minister
pew
he
remembered
that
it
was
instead
the
studied
deliberation
which
art
had
taught
him
he
went
on
feeling
more
and
more
that
the
skill
and
histrionic
power
of
his
best
days
were
returning
to
him
were
as
marked
as
ever
nay
had
never
triumphed
before
as
they
were
triumphing
now
the
congregation
watched
and
listened
with
open
steadfast
eyes
and
parted
lips
for
the
first
time
in
all
that
weary
quarter
their
faces
shone
the
sustaining
sparkle
of
their
gaze
lifted
him
to
a
peroration
unrivalled
in
his
own
recollection
of
himself
he
sat
down
and
bent
his
head
forward
upon
the
open
bible
breathing
hard
but
suffused
with
a
glow
of
satisfaction
his
ears
caught
the
music
of
that
sighing
rustle
through
the
audience
which
bespeaks
a
profound
impression
he
could
scarcely
keep
the
fingers
of
his
hands
covering
his
bowed
face
in
a
devotional
posture
as
they
were
from
drumming
a
jubilant
tattoo
his
pulses
did
this
in
every
vein
throbbing
with
excited
exultation
the
insistent
whim
seized
him
as
he
still
bent
thus
before
his
people
to
whisper
to
his
own
heart
at
last
the
dogs
the
announcement
that
in
the
evening
a
series
of
revival
meetings
was
to
be
inaugurated
had
been
made
at
the
and
it
was
repeated
now
from
the
pulpit
with
the
added
statement
that
for
the
once
the
usually
following
this
morning
service
would
be
suspended
then
theron
came
down
the
steps
conscious
after
a
fashion
that
the
presiding
elder
had
laid
a
propitiatory
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
spoken
amiably
about
the
sermon
and
that
several
groups
of
more
or
less
important
parishioners
were
waiting
in
the
aisle
and
the
vestibule
to
shake
hands
and
tell
him
how
much
they
had
enjoyed
the
sermon
his
mind
perversely
kept
hold
of
the
thought
that
all
this
came
too
late
he
politely
smiled
his
way
along
out
and
overtaking
the
soulsbys
and
his
wife
near
the
parsonage
gate
went
in
with
them
at
the
cold
noonday
meal
which
was
the
sunday
rule
of
the
house
theron
rather
expected
that
his
guests
would
talk
about
the
sermon
or
at
any
rate
about
the
events
of
the
morning
a
sabbath
chill
seemed
to
have
settled
upon
both
their
tongues
they
ate
almost
in
silence
and
their
sparse
remarks
touched
upon
topics
far
removed
from
church
affairs
alice
too
seemed
strangely
disinclined
to
conversation
the
husband
knew
her
face
and
its
varying
moods
so
well
that
he
could
see
she
was
laboring
under
some
very
powerful
and
deep
emotion
no
doubt
it
was
the
sermon
the
oratorical
swing
of
which
still
tingled
in
his
own
blood
that
had
so
affected
her
if
she
had
said
so
it
would
have
pleased
him
but
she
said
nothing
after
dinner
brother
soulsby
disappeared
in
his
bedroom
with
the
remark
that
he
guessed
he
would
lie
down
awhile
sister
soulsby
put
on
her
bonnet
and
explaining
that
she
always
prepared
herself
for
an
evening
work
by
a
long
solitary
walk
quitted
the
house
alice
after
she
had
put
the
dinner
things
away
went
upstairs
and
stayed
there
left
to
himself
theron
spent
the
afternoon
in
the
and
in
the
intervals
of
confused
introspection
read
recollections
of
my
youth
through
again
from
cover
to
cover
he
went
through
the
remarkable
experiences
attending
the
opening
of
the
revival
when
evening
came
as
one
in
a
dream
long
before
the
hour
for
the
service
arrived
the
sexton
came
in
to
tell
him
that
the
church
was
already
nearly
full
and
that
it
was
going
to
be
impossible
to
present
any
distinction
in
the
matter
of
pews
when
the
party
from
the
parsonage
went
over
after
another
cold
and
mostly
silent
meal
it
was
to
find
the
interior
of
the
church
densely
packed
and
people
being
turned
away
from
the
doors
theron
was
supposed
to
preside
over
what
followed
and
he
did
sit
on
the
central
chair
in
the
pulpit
between
the
presiding
elder
and
brother
soulsby
and
on
the
several
needful
occasions
did
rise
and
perfunctorily
make
the
formal
remarks
required
of
him
the
elder
preached
a
short
but
vigorously
phrased
sermon
the
soulsbys
sang
three
or
four
times
on
each
occasion
with
familiar
hymnal
words
set
to
novel
concerted
music
and
then
separately
exhorted
the
assemblage
the
husband
part
seemed
well
done
if
his
speech
lacked
some
of
the
fire
of
the
divine
girdings
which
older
methodists
recalled
it
still
led
straight
and
with
kindling
fervency
up
to
a
season
of
power
the
wife
took
up
the
word
as
he
sat
down
she
had
risen
from
one
of
the
and
speaking
as
she
walked
she
moved
forward
till
she
stood
within
the
immediately
under
the
pulpit
and
from
this
place
facing
the
listening
throng
she
delivered
her
harangue
those
who
watched
her
words
most
intently
got
the
least
sense
of
meaning
from
them
the
phrases
were
all
familiar
enough
jesus
a
very
present
help
sprinkled
by
the
blood
comforted
by
the
word
sanctified
by
the
spirit
born
into
the
kingdom
and
a
hundred
others
but
it
was
as
in
the
case
of
her
singing
the
words
were
old
the
music
was
new
what
sister
soulsby
said
did
not
matter
the
way
she
said
it
the
splendid
searching
sweep
of
her
great
eyes
the
vibrating
roll
of
her
voice
now
full
of
tears
now
scornful
now
boldly
jubilantly
triumphant
the
sympathetic
swaying
of
her
willowy
figure
under
the
stress
of
her
eloquence
was
all
wonderful
when
she
had
finished
and
stood
flushed
and
panting
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
pulpit
she
held
up
a
hand
deprecatingly
as
the
resounding
amens
and
bless
the
lords
began
to
well
up
about
her
you
have
heard
us
sing
she
said
smiling
to
apologize
for
her
shortness
of
breath
now
we
want
to
hear
you
sing
her
husband
had
risen
as
she
spoke
and
on
the
instant
with
a
far
greater
volume
of
voice
than
they
had
hitherto
disclosed
the
two
began
from
greenland
icy
mountains
in
the
old
familiar
tune
it
did
not
need
sister
soulsby
urgent
and
dramatic
gesture
to
lift
people
to
their
feet
the
whole
assemblage
sprang
up
and
under
the
guidance
of
these
two
powerful
leading
voices
thundered
the
hymn
out
as
octavius
had
never
heard
it
before
while
its
echoes
were
still
alive
the
woman
began
speaking
again
do
sit
down
she
cried
you
would
stand
up
if
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
going
by
even
if
he
was
only
going
fishing
how
much
more
should
you
stand
up
in
honor
of
living
souls
passing
forward
to
find
their
saviour
the
psychological
moment
was
upon
them
groans
and
cries
arose
and
a
palpable
ferment
stirred
the
throng
the
exhortation
to
sinners
to
declare
themselves
to
come
to
the
altar
was
not
only
on
the
revivalist
lips
it
seemed
to
quiver
in
the
very
air
to
be
borne
on
every
inarticulate
exclamation
in
the
clamor
of
the
brethren
a
young
woman
with
a
dazed
and
startled
look
in
her
eyes
rose
in
the
body
of
the
church
tremblingly
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
with
bowed
head
and
blushing
cheeks
pressed
her
way
out
from
the
end
of
a
crowded
pew
and
down
the
aisle
to
the
rail
a
triumphant
outburst
of
welcoming
ejaculations
swelled
to
the
roof
as
she
knelt
there
and
under
its
impetus
others
followed
her
example
with
interspersed
snatches
of
song
and
shouted
encouragements
the
excitement
reached
its
height
only
when
twoscore
people
mostly
young
were
tightly
clustered
upon
their
knees
about
the
rail
and
in
the
space
opening
upon
the
aisle
above
the
confusion
of
penitential
sobs
and
moans
and
the
hysterical
murmurings
of
members
whose
conviction
of
entire
sanctity
kept
them
in
their
seats
could
be
heard
the
voices
of
the
presiding
elder
the
soulsbys
and
the
elderly
deacons
of
the
church
who
moved
about
among
the
kneeling
mourners
bending
over
them
and
patting
their
shoulders
and
calling
out
to
them
fasten
your
thoughts
on
jesus
oh
the
precious
blood
blessed
be
his
name
seek
him
and
you
shall
find
him
cling
to
jesus
and
him
crucified
the
rev
theron
ware
did
not
with
the
others
descend
from
the
pulpit
seated
where
he
could
not
see
sister
soulsby
he
had
failed
utterly
to
be
moved
by
the
wave
of
enthusiasm
she
had
evoked
what
he
heard
her
say
disappointed
him
he
had
expected
from
her
more
originality
more
spice
of
her
own
idiomatic
individual
sort
he
viewed
with
a
cold
sense
of
aloofness
the
evidences
of
her
success
when
they
began
to
come
forward
and
abase
themselves
at
the
altar
the
instant
resolve
that
come
what
might
he
would
not
go
down
there
among
them
sprang
up
in
his
mind
he
saw
his
two
companions
pass
him
and
descend
the
pulpit
stairs
and
their
action
only
hardened
his
resolution
if
an
excuse
were
needed
he
was
presiding
and
the
place
to
preside
in
was
the
pulpit
but
he
waived
in
his
mind
the
whole
question
of
an
excuse
after
a
little
he
put
his
hand
over
his
face
leaning
the
elbow
forward
on
the
the
scene
below
would
have
thrilled
him
to
the
marrow
six
months
yes
three
months
ago
he
put
a
finger
across
his
eyes
now
to
half
shut
it
out
the
spectacle
of
these
silly
young
mourners
kneeling
they
knew
not
why
trembling
at
they
could
not
tell
what
pledging
themselves
frantically
to
dogmas
and
mysteries
they
knew
nothing
of
under
the
influence
of
a
hubbub
of
outcries
as
meaningless
in
their
way
and
inspiring
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
racket
of
a
fife
and
drum
corps
the
spectacle
saddened
and
humiliated
him
now
he
was
conscious
of
a
dawning
sense
of
shame
at
being
even
tacitly
responsible
for
such
a
thing
his
fancy
conjured
up
the
idea
of
ledsmar
coming
in
and
beholding
this
maudlin
and
unseemly
scene
and
he
felt
his
face
grow
hot
at
the
bare
thought
looking
through
his
fingers
theron
all
at
once
saw
something
which
caught
at
his
breath
with
a
sharp
clutch
alice
had
risen
from
the
minister
pew
the
most
conspicuous
one
in
the
church
and
was
moving
down
the
aisle
toward
the
rail
her
uplifted
face
in
its
whiteness
and
her
eyes
looking
straight
ahead
the
young
pastor
could
scarcely
credit
his
sight
he
thrust
aside
his
hand
and
bent
forward
only
to
see
his
wife
sink
upon
her
knees
among
the
rest
and
to
hear
this
notable
accession
to
the
mourners
hailed
by
a
tumult
of
approving
shouts
then
remembering
himself
he
drew
back
and
put
up
his
hand
shutting
out
the
strange
scene
altogether
to
see
nothing
at
all
was
a
relief
and
under
cover
he
closed
his
eyes
and
bit
his
teeth
together
a
fresh
outburst
of
thanksgivings
spreading
noisily
through
the
congregation
prompted
him
to
peer
through
his
fingers
again
levi
gorringe
was
making
his
way
down
the
aisle
was
at
the
moment
quite
in
front
theron
found
himself
watching
this
man
with
the
stern
composure
of
a
fatalist
the
clamant
brethren
down
below
were
stirred
to
new
excitement
by
the
thought
that
the
sceptical
lawyer
so
long
with
them
yet
not
of
them
had
been
humbled
and
won
by
the
outpourings
of
the
spirit
theron
perceptions
were
keener
he
knew
that
gorringe
was
coming
forward
to
kneel
beside
alice
the
knowledge
left
him
curiously
undisturbed
he
saw
the
lawyer
advance
gently
insinuate
himself
past
the
form
of
some
kneeling
mourner
who
was
in
his
way
and
drop
on
his
knees
close
beside
the
bowed
figure
of
alice
the
two
touched
shoulders
as
they
bent
forward
beneath
sister
soulsby
outstretched
hands
held
over
them
as
in
a
blessing
theron
looked
fixedly
at
them
and
professed
to
himself
that
he
was
barely
interested
a
little
afterward
he
was
standing
up
in
his
place
and
reading
aloud
a
list
of
names
which
one
of
the
stewards
had
given
him
they
were
the
names
of
those
who
had
asked
that
evening
to
be
taken
into
the
church
as
members
on
probation
the
sounds
of
the
recent
excitement
were
all
hushed
now
save
as
two
or
three
enthusiasts
in
a
corner
raised
their
voices
in
abrupt
greeting
of
each
name
in
its
turn
but
theron
felt
somehow
that
this
noise
had
been
transferred
to
the
inside
of
his
head
a
continuous
buzzing
went
on
there
so
that
the
sound
of
his
voice
was
and
unfamiliar
in
his
ears
he
read
through
the
list
comprising
some
fifteen
items
and
pronounced
the
names
with
great
distinctness
it
was
necessary
to
take
pains
with
this
because
the
only
name
his
blurred
eyes
seemed
to
see
anywhere
on
the
foolscap
sheet
was
that
of
levi
gorringe
when
he
had
finished
and
was
taking
his
seat
some
one
began
speaking
to
him
from
the
body
of
the
church
he
saw
that
this
was
the
steward
who
was
explaining
to
him
that
the
most
important
name
of
the
lot
that
of
brother
gorringe
had
not
been
read
out
theron
smiled
and
shook
his
head
then
when
the
presiding
elder
touched
him
on
the
arm
and
assured
him
that
he
had
not
mentioned
the
name
in
question
he
replied
quite
simply
and
with
another
smile
i
thought
it
was
the
only
name
i
did
read
then
he
sat
down
abruptly
and
let
his
head
fall
to
one
side
there
were
hurried
movements
inside
the
pulpit
and
people
in
the
audience
had
begun
to
stand
up
wonderingly
when
the
presiding
elder
with
uplifted
hands
confronted
them
we
will
omit
the
doxology
and
depart
quietly
after
the
benediction
he
said
brother
ware
seems
to
have
been
overcome
by
the
chapter
xvi
when
theron
woke
next
morning
alice
seemed
to
have
dressed
and
left
the
room
a
thing
which
had
never
happened
before
this
fact
connected
itself
at
once
in
his
brain
with
the
recollection
of
her
having
made
an
exhibition
of
herself
the
previous
evening
going
forward
before
all
eyes
to
join
the
unconverted
and
penitent
sinners
as
if
she
were
some
tramp
or
shady
female
instead
of
an
educated
lady
a
professing
member
from
her
girlhood
and
a
minister
wife
it
crossed
his
mind
that
probably
she
had
risen
and
got
away
noiselessly
for
very
shame
at
looking
him
in
the
face
after
such
absurd
behavior
then
he
remembered
more
and
grasped
the
situation
he
had
fainted
in
church
and
had
been
brought
home
and
helped
to
bed
dim
memories
of
unaccustomed
faces
in
the
bedroom
of
nauseous
drugs
and
hushed
voices
came
to
him
out
of
the
now
that
he
thought
of
it
he
was
a
sick
man
having
settled
this
he
went
off
to
sleep
again
a
feverish
and
broken
sleep
and
remained
in
this
state
most
of
the
time
for
the
following
hours
in
the
brief
though
numerous
intervals
of
waking
he
found
certain
things
clear
in
his
mind
one
was
that
he
was
annoyed
with
alice
but
would
dissemble
his
feelings
another
was
that
it
was
much
pleasanter
to
be
ill
than
to
be
forced
to
attend
and
take
part
in
those
revival
meetings
these
two
ideas
came
and
went
in
a
lazy
drowsy
fashion
mixing
themselves
up
with
other
vagrant
fancies
yet
always
remaining
on
top
in
the
evening
the
singing
from
the
church
next
door
filled
his
room
the
soulsbys
part
of
it
was
worth
keeping
awake
for
he
turned
over
and
deliberately
dozed
when
the
congregation
sang
alice
came
up
a
number
of
times
during
the
day
to
ask
how
he
felt
and
to
bring
him
broth
or
on
several
occasions
when
he
heard
her
step
the
perverse
inclination
mastered
him
to
shut
his
eyes
and
pretend
to
be
asleep
so
that
she
might
out
again
she
had
a
depressed
and
thoughtful
air
and
spoke
to
him
like
one
whose
mind
was
on
something
else
neither
of
them
alluded
to
what
had
happened
the
previous
evening
toward
the
close
of
the
long
day
she
came
to
ask
him
whether
he
would
prefer
her
to
remain
in
the
house
instead
of
attending
the
meeting
go
by
all
means
he
said
almost
curtly
the
presiding
elder
and
the
superintendent
called
early
tuesday
morning
at
the
parsonage
to
make
brotherly
inquiries
and
theron
was
feeling
so
much
better
that
he
himself
suggested
their
coming
upstairs
to
see
him
the
elder
was
in
good
spirits
he
smiled
approvingly
and
even
put
in
a
jocose
word
or
two
while
the
superintendent
sketched
for
the
invalid
in
a
cheerful
way
the
leading
incidents
of
the
previous
evening
there
had
been
an
enormous
crowd
even
greater
than
that
of
sunday
night
and
everybody
had
been
looking
forward
to
another
notable
and
exciting
season
of
grace
these
expectations
were
especially
heightened
when
sister
soulsby
ascended
the
pulpit
stairs
and
took
charge
of
the
proceedings
she
deferred
to
paul
views
about
women
preachers
on
sundays
she
said
but
on
weekdays
she
had
just
as
much
right
to
snatch
brands
from
the
burning
as
paul
or
peter
or
any
other
man
she
went
on
like
that
in
a
breezy
fashion
which
tickled
the
audience
immensely
and
led
to
the
liveliest
anticipations
of
what
would
happen
when
she
began
upon
the
evening
harvest
of
souls
but
it
was
something
else
that
happened
at
a
signal
from
sister
soulsby
the
steward
got
up
and
in
an
unconcerned
sort
of
way
went
through
the
throng
to
the
rear
of
the
church
locked
the
doors
and
put
the
keys
in
their
pockets
the
sister
dryly
explained
now
to
the
surprised
congregation
that
there
was
a
season
for
all
things
and
that
on
the
present
occasion
they
would
suspend
the
glorious
work
of
redeeming
fallen
human
nature
and
take
up
instead
the
equally
noble
task
of
raising
some
fifteen
hundred
dollars
which
the
church
needed
in
its
business
the
doors
would
only
be
opened
again
when
this
had
been
accomplished
the
brethren
were
much
taken
aback
by
this
trick
and
they
permitted
themselves
to
exchange
a
good
many
scowling
and
indignant
glances
the
while
their
professional
visitors
sang
another
of
their
delightfully
novel
sacred
duets
its
charm
of
harmony
for
once
fell
upon
unsympathetic
ears
but
then
sister
soulsby
began
another
monologue
defending
this
way
of
collecting
money
chaffing
the
assemblage
with
impudence
on
their
having
been
trapped
and
scoring
one
after
another
neat
and
jocose
little
personal
points
on
local
characteristics
at
which
everybody
but
the
individual
touched
grinned
broadly
she
was
so
droll
and
cheeky
and
withal
effective
in
her
talk
that
she
quite
won
the
crowd
over
she
told
a
story
about
a
woodchuck
which
fairly
brought
down
the
house
a
man
she
began
with
a
quizzical
twinkle
in
her
eye
told
me
once
about
hunting
a
woodchuck
with
a
pack
of
dogs
and
they
chased
it
so
hard
that
it
finally
escaped
only
by
climbing
a
my
friend
i
said
to
him
ca
climb
trees
or
any
other
kind
and
you
know
it
all
he
said
in
reply
to
me
was
woodchuck
had
to
climb
a
tree
and
that
the
way
with
this
congregation
you
think
you
ca
raise
but
you
got
so
it
went
on
she
set
them
all
laughing
and
then
with
a
twist
of
the
eyes
and
a
change
of
voice
lo
and
behold
she
had
them
nearly
crying
in
the
same
breath
under
the
pressure
of
these
jumbled
emotions
brethren
began
to
rise
up
in
their
pews
and
say
what
they
would
give
the
wonderful
woman
had
something
smart
and
apt
to
say
about
each
fresh
contribution
and
used
it
to
screw
up
the
general
interest
a
notch
further
toward
benevolent
hysteria
with
songs
and
jokes
and
impromptu
exhortations
and
prayers
she
kept
the
thing
whirling
until
a
sort
of
duel
of
generosity
began
between
two
of
the
most
unlikely
men
erastus
winch
and
levi
gorringe
everybody
had
been
surprised
when
winch
gave
his
first
but
when
he
rose
again
half
an
hour
afterward
and
said
that
owing
to
the
high
public
position
of
some
of
the
new
members
on
probation
he
foresaw
a
great
future
for
the
church
and
so
felt
moved
to
give
another
there
was
general
amazement
moved
by
a
common
instinct
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
levi
gorringe
and
he
without
the
slightest
hesitation
stood
up
and
said
he
would
give
there
was
something
in
his
tone
which
must
have
annoyed
brother
winch
for
he
shot
up
like
a
dart
and
called
out
put
me
down
for
fifty
more
and
that
brought
gorringe
to
his
feet
with
an
added
and
then
the
two
went
on
raising
each
other
till
the
assemblage
was
agape
with
admiring
stupefaction
this
gladiatorial
combat
might
have
been
going
on
till
now
the
superintendent
concluded
if
winch
had
subsided
the
amount
of
the
contributions
had
been
figured
up
yet
for
sister
soulsby
kept
the
list
but
there
had
been
a
tremendous
lot
of
money
raised
of
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
the
presiding
elder
now
told
theron
that
the
quarterly
conference
had
been
adjourned
yesterday
till
today
he
and
brother
davis
were
even
now
on
their
way
to
attend
the
session
in
the
church
next
door
the
elder
added
with
an
obvious
kindly
significance
that
though
theron
was
too
ill
to
attend
it
he
guessed
his
absence
would
do
him
no
harm
then
the
two
men
left
the
room
and
theron
went
to
sleep
again
another
almost
blank
period
ensued
this
time
lasting
for
hours
the
young
minister
was
enfolded
in
the
coils
of
a
fever
of
some
sort
which
brother
soulsby
who
had
dabbled
considerably
in
medicine
admitted
that
he
was
puzzled
about
sometimes
he
thought
that
it
was
typhoid
and
then
again
there
were
symptoms
which
looked
suspiciously
like
brain
fever
the
methodists
of
octavius
counted
no
physician
among
their
numbers
and
when
on
the
second
day
alice
grew
scared
and
decided
with
brother
soulsby
assent
to
call
in
professional
advice
the
only
doctor
name
she
could
recall
was
that
of
ledsmar
she
was
conscious
of
an
instinctive
dislike
for
the
vague
image
of
him
her
fancy
had
conjured
up
but
the
reflection
that
he
was
theron
friend
and
so
probably
would
be
more
moderate
in
his
charges
decided
her
brother
soulsby
showed
a
most
comforting
tact
and
swiftness
of
apprehension
when
alice
in
mentioning
ledsmar
name
disclosed
by
her
manner
a
fear
that
his
being
sent
for
would
create
talk
among
the
church
people
he
volunteered
at
once
to
act
as
messenger
himself
and
with
no
better
guide
than
her
dim
hints
at
direction
found
the
doctor
and
brought
him
back
to
the
parsonage
ledsmar
expressly
disclaimed
to
soulsby
all
pretence
of
professional
skill
and
made
him
understand
that
he
went
along
solely
because
he
liked
ware
and
was
interested
in
him
and
in
any
case
would
probably
be
of
as
much
use
as
the
wisest
of
strange
physicians
a
view
which
the
little
revivalist
received
with
comprehending
nods
of
tacit
acquiescence
ledsmar
came
and
was
taken
up
to
the
he
sat
on
the
bedside
and
talked
with
theron
awhile
and
then
went
downstairs
again
to
alice
anxious
inquiries
he
replied
that
it
seemed
to
him
merely
a
case
of
and
about
which
there
was
not
the
slightest
occasion
for
alarm
but
he
says
the
strangest
things
the
wife
put
in
he
has
been
quite
delirious
at
that
means
only
that
his
brain
is
taking
a
rest
as
well
as
his
body
remarked
ledsmar
that
is
nature
way
of
securing
an
equilibrium
of
repose
of
recuperation
he
will
come
out
of
it
with
his
mind
all
the
fresher
and
i
do
believe
he
knows
shucks
was
alice
comment
when
she
closed
the
street
door
upon
ledsmar
anybody
could
have
come
in
and
looked
at
a
sick
man
and
said
him
alone
you
expect
something
more
from
a
doctor
it
his
business
to
say
what
to
do
and
i
suppose
charge
two
dollars
for
just
telling
me
that
my
husband
was
resting
no
said
brother
soulsby
he
said
he
never
practised
and
that
he
would
come
only
as
a
well
it
is
my
idea
of
a
friend
not
to
prescribe
a
single
thing
protested
alice
yet
it
seemed
that
no
prescription
was
needed
after
all
the
next
morning
theron
woke
to
find
himself
feeling
quite
restored
in
spirits
and
nerves
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
after
an
instant
of
weakly
giddiness
recognized
that
he
was
all
right
again
greatly
pleased
he
got
up
and
proceeded
to
dress
himself
there
were
little
recurring
hints
of
faintness
and
vertigo
while
he
was
shaving
but
he
had
the
sense
to
refer
these
to
the
fact
that
he
was
very
very
hungry
he
went
downstairs
and
smiled
with
the
pleased
pride
of
a
child
at
the
surprise
which
his
appearance
at
the
door
created
alice
and
the
soulsbys
were
at
breakfast
he
joined
them
and
ate
voraciously
declaring
that
it
was
worth
a
month
illness
to
have
things
taste
so
good
once
more
you
still
look
white
as
a
sheet
said
alice
warningly
if
i
were
you
i
be
careful
in
my
diet
for
a
spell
for
answer
theron
let
sister
soulsby
help
him
again
to
ham
and
eggs
he
talked
exclusively
to
sister
soulsby
or
rather
invited
her
by
his
manner
to
talk
to
him
and
listened
and
watched
her
with
indolent
content
there
was
a
sort
of
happy
and
purified
languor
in
his
physical
and
mental
being
which
needed
and
appreciated
just
this
to
sit
next
a
bright
and
attractive
woman
at
a
good
breakfast
and
be
ministered
to
by
her
sprightly
conversation
by
the
flash
of
her
informing
and
inspiring
eyes
and
the
nameless
sense
of
support
and
repose
which
her
near
proximity
exhaled
he
felt
himself
figuratively
leaning
against
sister
soulsby
buoyant
personality
and
resting
brother
soulsby
like
the
intelligent
creature
he
was
ate
his
breakfast
in
peace
but
alice
would
interpose
remarks
from
time
to
time
theron
was
conscious
of
a
certain
annoyance
at
this
and
knew
that
he
was
showing
it
by
an
exaggerated
display
of
interest
in
everything
sister
soulsby
said
and
persisted
in
it
there
trembled
in
the
background
of
his
thoughts
ever
and
again
the
recollection
of
a
grievance
against
his
wife
an
offence
which
she
had
committed
but
he
put
it
aside
as
something
to
be
grappled
and
dealt
with
when
he
felt
again
like
taking
up
the
serious
and
disagreeable
things
of
life
for
the
moment
he
desired
only
to
be
amused
by
sister
soulsby
her
casual
mention
of
the
fact
that
she
and
her
husband
were
taking
their
departure
that
very
day
appealed
to
him
as
an
added
reason
for
devoting
his
entire
attention
to
her
you
must
forget
that
famous
you
threatened
me
with
that
you
know
he
reminded
her
when
he
found
himself
alone
with
her
after
breakfast
he
smiled
as
he
spoke
in
frank
enjoyment
of
the
prospect
sister
soulsby
nodded
and
aided
with
a
roll
of
her
eyes
the
effect
of
in
her
uplifted
forefinger
oh
never
fear
she
cried
you
catch
it
hot
and
strong
but
that
keep
till
afternoon
tell
me
do
you
feel
strong
enough
to
go
in
next
door
and
attend
the
trustees
meeting
this
forenoon
it
rather
important
that
you
should
be
there
if
you
can
spur
yourself
up
to
it
by
the
way
you
asked
what
happened
at
the
quarterly
conference
theron
sighed
and
made
a
little
grimace
of
repugnance
if
you
knew
how
little
i
cared
he
said
i
did
hope
you
forget
all
about
mentioning
that
and
everything
else
connected
with
the
next
door
you
talk
so
much
more
interestingly
about
other
here
gratitude
for
you
exclaimed
sister
soulsby
with
a
gay
simulation
of
despair
why
man
alive
do
you
know
what
i
done
for
you
i
got
around
on
the
presiding
elder
blind
side
i
captured
old
pierce
i
wound
winch
right
around
my
little
finger
i
worked
two
or
three
of
the
all
on
your
account
the
result
was
you
went
through
as
if
you
had
your
ears
pinned
back
and
been
greased
all
over
you
got
an
extra
hundred
dollars
added
to
your
salary
do
you
hear
on
the
sixth
question
of
the
order
of
business
the
elder
ruled
that
the
recommendation
of
the
last
conference
estimating
committee
could
be
revised
between
ourselves
he
was
wrong
but
that
matter
and
so
you
in
clover
and
very
friendly
things
were
said
about
you
it
was
very
kind
of
you
said
theron
i
am
really
extremely
grateful
to
he
shook
her
by
the
hand
to
make
up
for
what
he
realized
to
be
a
lack
of
fervor
in
his
tones
well
then
sister
soulsby
replied
you
pull
yourself
together
and
take
your
place
as
chairman
of
the
trustees
meeting
and
see
to
it
that
whatever
comes
up
you
side
with
old
pierce
and
oh
they
my
friends
now
are
they
asked
theron
with
a
faint
play
of
irony
about
his
lips
yes
that
your
ticket
this
election
she
answered
briskly
and
mind
you
vote
it
straight
do
bother
about
reasons
now
just
take
it
from
me
as
the
song
says
things
have
changed
since
willie
died
that
all
and
then
come
back
here
and
this
afternoon
we
have
a
good
the
rev
ware
walking
with
ostentatious
feebleness
and
forcing
a
conventional
smile
upon
his
wan
face
duly
made
his
unexpected
appearance
at
the
trustees
meeting
in
one
of
the
smaller
classrooms
he
received
their
congratulations
gravely
and
shook
hands
with
all
three
it
required
an
effort
to
do
this
impartially
because
upon
sight
of
levi
gorringe
there
rose
up
suddenly
within
him
an
emotion
of
fierce
dislike
and
enmity
in
some
enigmatic
way
his
thoughts
had
kept
themselves
away
from
gorringe
ever
since
sunday
evening
now
they
concentrated
with
furious
energy
and
swiftness
upon
him
theron
seemed
able
in
a
flash
of
time
to
coordinate
many
recollections
of
gorringe
the
early
liking
alice
had
professed
for
him
the
mystery
of
those
purchased
plants
in
her
garden
the
story
of
the
girl
he
had
lost
in
church
his
offer
to
lend
him
money
the
way
in
which
he
had
sat
beside
alice
at
the
and
followed
her
to
the
in
the
evening
these
raced
abreast
through
the
young
minister
brain
yet
with
each
its
own
image
and
its
relation
to
the
others
clearly
defined
he
found
the
nerve
all
the
same
to
take
this
third
trustee
by
the
hand
and
to
thank
him
for
his
congratulations
and
even
to
say
with
a
surface
smile
of
welcome
it
is
brother
gorringe
now
i
the
work
before
the
meeting
was
chiefly
of
a
routine
kind
in
most
places
this
would
have
been
transacted
by
the
stewards
but
in
octavius
these
minor
officials
had
degenerated
into
mere
ceremonial
abstractions
who
humbly
ratified
or
by
arrangement
anticipated
the
will
of
the
powerful
trustees
theron
sat
languidly
at
the
head
of
the
table
while
these
matters
passed
in
their
course
noting
the
intonations
of
gorringe
voice
as
he
read
from
his
secretary
book
and
finding
his
ear
displeased
by
them
no
issue
arose
upon
any
of
these
trivial
affairs
and
the
minister
feeling
faint
and
weary
in
the
heat
wondered
why
sister
soulsby
had
insisted
on
his
coming
all
at
once
he
sat
up
straight
with
an
instinctive
warning
in
his
mind
that
here
was
the
thing
gorringe
had
taken
up
the
subject
of
the
evening
and
read
out
its
essentials
as
they
had
been
embodied
in
a
report
of
the
stewards
the
gross
sum
obtained
in
cash
and
promises
was
the
stewards
had
collected
of
this
a
trifle
less
than
half
but
hoped
to
get
it
all
in
during
the
ensuing
quarter
there
were
also
the
bill
of
and
soulsby
for
and
the
increases
of
in
the
pastor
salary
and
in
the
apportioned
contribution
of
the
charge
toward
the
presiding
elder
maintenance
the
two
latter
items
of
which
the
quarterly
conference
had
sanctioned
i
want
to
hear
the
names
of
the
subscribers
and
their
amounts
read
out
put
in
brother
pierce
when
this
was
done
it
became
apparent
that
much
more
than
half
of
the
entire
amount
had
been
offered
by
two
men
levi
gorringe
and
erastus
winch
left
only
to
be
divided
up
among
some
seventy
or
eighty
other
members
of
the
congregation
brother
pierce
speedily
stopped
the
reading
of
these
subordinate
names
they
of
no
concern
whatever
he
said
despite
the
fact
that
his
own
might
have
been
reached
in
time
those
first
names
are
what
i
was
getting
at
have
those
two
first
amounts
the
big
ones
paid
one
has
the
other
not
replied
gorringe
remarked
the
senior
trustee
and
i
goin
to
move
that
it
need
be
paid
either
when
brother
winch
here
began
out
those
extra
and
fifties
that
evening
it
was
under
a
complete
misapprehension
he
on
the
cheese
board
that
same
monday
afternoon
and
he
done
what
he
thought
was
a
mighty
big
stroke
of
business
and
he
felt
liberal
according
i
know
just
what
that
is
myself
if
i
makin
a
mint
o
money
instead
o
losin
all
the
while
as
i
do
i
done
just
the
same
but
the
next
day
lo
and
behold
brother
winch
found
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
he
had
made
a
single
fact
is
i
lost
by
the
whole
transaction
put
in
erastus
winch
defiantly
just
so
brother
pierce
went
on
he
lost
money
you
have
his
own
word
for
it
well
then
i
say
it
would
be
a
burning
shame
for
us
to
consent
to
touch
one
penny
of
what
he
offered
to
give
in
the
fullness
of
his
heart
while
he
was
laborin
under
that
delusion
and
i
move
he
be
not
asked
for
it
we
got
quite
as
much
as
we
need
without
it
i
put
my
that
is
you
do
put
it
suggested
winch
correctingly
you
move
it
and
brother
ware
whom
we
all
so
glad
to
see
able
to
come
and
preside
he
put
there
was
a
moment
silence
you
heard
the
motion
said
theron
tentatively
and
then
paused
for
possible
remarks
he
was
not
going
to
meddle
in
this
thing
himself
and
gorringe
was
the
only
other
who
might
have
an
opinion
to
offer
the
necessities
of
the
situation
forced
him
to
glance
at
the
lawyer
inquiringly
he
did
so
and
turned
his
eyes
away
again
like
a
shot
gorringe
was
looking
him
squarely
in
the
face
and
the
look
was
freighted
with
satirical
contempt
the
young
minister
spoke
between
clinched
teeth
all
those
in
favor
will
say
brothers
pierce
and
winch
put
up
a
simultaneous
and
confident
no
you
do
interposed
the
lawyer
with
deliberate
sneering
emphasis
i
decidedly
protest
against
winch
voting
he
directly
interested
and
he
must
vote
your
chairman
knows
that
perfectly
yes
i
think
brother
winch
ought
not
to
vote
decided
theron
with
great
calmness
he
saw
now
what
was
coming
and
underneath
his
surface
composure
there
were
sharp
flutterings
very
well
then
said
gorringe
i
vote
no
and
it
a
tie
it
rests
with
the
chairman
now
to
cast
the
deciding
vote
and
say
whether
this
interesting
arrangement
shall
go
through
or
me
said
theron
eying
the
lawyer
with
a
cool
which
had
come
all
at
once
to
him
me
oh
i
vote
chapter
xvii
well
i
did
what
you
told
me
to
do
theron
ware
remarked
to
sister
soulsby
when
at
last
they
found
themselves
alone
in
the
after
the
midday
meal
it
had
taken
not
a
little
strategic
skirmishing
to
secure
the
room
to
themselves
for
the
hospitable
alice
much
touched
by
the
thought
of
her
new
friend
departure
that
very
evening
had
gladly
proposed
to
let
all
the
work
stand
over
until
night
and
devote
herself
entirely
to
sister
soulsby
when
finally
brother
soulsby
conceived
and
deftly
executed
the
coup
of
interesting
her
in
the
budding
of
roses
and
then
leading
her
off
into
the
garden
to
see
with
her
own
eyes
how
it
was
done
theron
had
a
sense
of
being
left
alone
with
a
conspirator
the
notion
impelled
him
to
plunge
at
once
into
the
heart
of
their
mystery
i
did
what
you
told
me
to
do
he
repeated
looking
up
from
his
low
to
where
she
sat
by
the
desk
and
i
dare
say
you
wo
be
surprised
when
i
add
that
i
have
no
respect
for
myself
for
doing
and
yet
you
would
go
and
do
it
right
over
again
eh
the
woman
said
in
bright
pert
tones
nodding
her
head
and
smiling
at
him
with
roguish
comprehending
eyes
yes
that
the
way
we
built
we
spend
our
lives
doing
that
sort
of
i
do
know
that
you
would
precisely
grasp
my
meaning
said
the
young
minister
with
a
polite
effort
in
his
words
to
mask
the
untoward
side
of
the
suggestion
it
is
a
matter
of
conscience
with
me
and
i
am
pained
and
shocked
at
sister
soulsby
drummed
for
an
absent
moment
with
her
thin
nervous
fingers
on
the
i
guess
maybe
you
better
go
and
lie
down
again
she
said
gently
you
a
sick
man
still
and
it
no
good
your
worrying
your
head
just
now
with
things
of
this
sort
you
see
them
differently
when
you
quite
yourself
no
no
pleaded
theron
do
let
us
have
our
talk
out
i
all
right
my
mind
is
clear
as
a
bell
truly
i
really
counted
on
this
talk
with
but
there
something
else
to
talk
about
is
there
besides
besides
your
conscience
she
asked
her
eyes
bent
upon
him
a
kindly
pressure
as
she
spoke
which
took
all
possible
harshness
from
her
meaning
theron
answered
the
glance
rather
than
her
words
i
know
that
you
are
my
friend
he
said
simply
sister
soulsby
straightened
herself
and
looked
down
upon
him
with
a
new
intentness
well
then
she
began
let
thrash
this
thing
out
right
now
and
be
done
with
it
you
say
it
hurt
your
conscience
to
do
just
one
little
hundredth
part
of
what
there
was
to
be
done
here
ask
yourself
what
you
mean
by
that
mind
i
not
quarrelling
and
i
not
thinking
about
anything
except
just
your
own
state
of
mind
you
think
you
soiled
your
hands
by
doing
what
you
did
that
is
to
say
you
wanted
all
the
dirty
work
done
by
other
people
that
it
is
it
the
rev
ware
sat
up
in
turn
and
looked
doubtingly
into
his
companion
face
oh
we
were
going
to
be
frank
you
know
she
added
with
a
pleasant
play
of
mingled
mirth
and
honest
liking
in
her
eyes
no
he
said
picking
his
words
my
point
would
rather
be
that
that
there
ought
not
to
have
been
any
of
what
you
yourself
call
this
this
work
that
is
my
now
we
getting
at
it
said
sister
soulsby
briskly
my
dear
friend
you
might
just
as
well
say
that
potatoes
are
unclean
and
unfit
to
eat
because
manure
is
put
into
the
ground
they
grow
in
just
look
at
the
case
your
church
here
was
running
behind
every
year
your
people
had
got
into
a
habit
of
putting
in
nickels
instead
of
dimes
and
letting
you
sweat
for
the
difference
that
a
habit
like
tobacco
or
biting
your
fingernails
or
anything
else
either
you
were
all
to
come
to
smash
here
or
the
people
had
to
be
shaken
up
stood
on
their
heads
broken
of
their
habit
it
my
business
mine
and
soulsby
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
we
came
here
and
we
did
it
did
it
up
brown
too
we
not
only
raised
all
the
money
the
church
needs
and
to
spare
but
i
took
a
personal
shine
to
you
and
went
out
of
my
way
to
fix
up
things
for
you
it
is
only
the
extra
hundred
dollars
but
the
whole
tone
of
the
congregation
is
changed
toward
you
now
you
see
that
they
be
asking
to
have
you
back
here
next
spring
and
you
solid
with
your
presiding
elder
too
well
now
tell
me
straight
is
that
worth
while
or
not
i
told
you
that
i
am
very
grateful
answered
the
minister
and
i
say
it
again
and
i
shall
never
be
tired
of
repeating
it
but
but
it
was
the
means
i
had
in
quite
so
rejoined
the
sister
patiently
if
you
saw
the
way
a
hotel
dinner
was
cooked
you
would
be
able
to
stomach
it
did
you
ever
see
a
play
in
a
theatre
i
mean
i
supposed
not
but
you
understand
when
i
say
that
the
performance
looks
one
way
from
where
the
audience
sit
and
quite
a
different
way
when
you
are
behind
the
scenes
there
you
see
that
the
trees
and
houses
are
cloth
and
the
moon
is
tissue
paper
and
the
flying
fairy
is
a
woman
strung
up
on
a
rope
that
does
prove
that
the
play
out
in
front
is
beautiful
and
affecting
and
all
that
it
only
shows
that
everything
in
this
world
is
produced
by
machinery
by
organization
the
trouble
is
that
been
let
in
on
the
stage
behind
the
scenes
so
to
speak
and
you
so
green
if
you
pardon
me
that
you
want
to
sit
down
and
cry
because
the
trees
are
cloth
and
the
moon
is
a
lantern
and
i
say
do
be
such
a
goose
i
see
what
you
mean
theron
said
with
an
answering
smile
he
added
more
gravely
all
the
same
the
winch
business
seems
to
me
now
the
winch
business
is
my
own
affair
sister
soulsby
broke
in
abruptly
i
take
all
the
responsibility
for
that
you
need
know
nothing
about
it
you
simply
voted
as
you
did
on
the
merits
of
the
case
as
he
presented
them
that
but
theron
began
and
then
paused
something
had
occurred
to
him
and
he
knitted
his
brows
to
follow
its
course
of
expansion
in
his
mind
suddenly
he
raised
his
head
then
you
arranged
with
winch
to
make
those
bogus
offers
just
to
lead
others
on
he
demanded
sister
soulsby
large
eyes
beamed
down
upon
him
in
reply
at
first
in
open
merriment
then
more
soberly
till
their
regard
was
almost
pensive
let
us
talk
of
something
else
she
said
all
that
is
past
and
gone
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
anyway
i
got
some
advice
to
give
you
about
keeping
up
this
grip
you
got
on
your
the
young
minister
had
risen
to
his
feet
while
she
spoke
he
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
with
rounded
shoulders
began
slowly
pacing
the
room
after
a
turn
or
two
he
came
to
the
desk
and
leaned
against
it
i
doubt
if
it
worth
while
going
into
that
he
said
in
the
solemn
tone
of
one
who
feels
that
an
irrevocable
thing
is
being
uttered
she
waited
to
hear
more
apparently
i
think
i
shall
go
away
give
up
the
ministry
he
added
sister
soulsby
eyes
revealed
no
such
shock
of
consternation
as
he
unconsciously
had
looked
for
they
remained
quite
calm
and
when
she
spoke
they
deepened
to
fit
her
speech
with
what
he
read
to
be
a
gaze
of
affectionate
melancholy
one
might
say
pity
she
shook
her
head
slowly
no
do
let
any
one
else
hear
you
say
that
she
replied
my
poor
young
friend
it
no
good
to
even
think
it
the
real
wisdom
is
to
school
yourself
to
move
along
smoothly
and
not
fret
and
get
the
best
of
what
going
i
known
others
who
felt
as
you
do
of
course
there
are
times
when
every
young
man
of
brains
and
high
notions
feels
that
way
but
there
no
help
for
it
those
who
tried
to
get
out
only
broke
themselves
those
who
stayed
in
and
made
the
best
of
it
well
one
of
them
will
be
a
bishop
in
another
ten
theron
had
started
walking
again
but
the
moral
degradation
of
it
he
snapped
out
at
her
over
his
shoulder
i
rather
earn
the
meanest
living
at
an
honest
trade
and
be
free
from
that
may
all
be
responded
sister
soulsby
but
it
is
a
question
of
what
you
rather
do
it
what
you
can
do
how
could
you
earn
a
living
what
trade
or
business
do
you
suppose
you
could
take
up
now
and
get
a
living
out
of
not
one
my
man
not
theron
stopped
and
stared
at
her
this
view
of
his
capabilities
came
upon
him
with
the
force
and
effect
of
a
blow
i
do
discover
myself
he
began
stumblingly
that
i
so
conspicuously
inferior
to
the
men
i
see
about
me
who
do
make
livings
and
very
good
ones
of
course
you
not
she
replied
with
easy
promptness
greatly
the
other
way
or
i
should
be
taking
this
trouble
with
you
but
you
what
you
are
because
you
where
you
are
the
moment
you
try
on
being
somewhere
else
you
done
for
in
all
this
world
nobody
else
comes
to
such
unmerciful
and
universal
grief
as
the
unfrocked
the
phrase
sent
theron
fancy
roving
i
know
a
catholic
priest
he
said
irrelevantly
who
does
believe
an
atom
in
in
very
likely
said
sister
soulsby
most
of
us
do
but
you
do
hear
him
talking
about
going
and
earning
his
living
i
bet
or
if
he
does
he
takes
powerful
good
care
not
to
go
all
the
same
they
got
those
priests
they
artists
too
they
know
how
to
allow
for
the
machinery
behind
the
but
it
all
so
different
urged
the
young
minister
the
same
things
are
not
expected
of
them
now
i
sat
the
other
night
and
watched
those
people
you
got
up
around
the
groaning
and
shouting
and
crying
and
the
others
jumping
up
and
down
with
excitement
and
sister
lovejoy
did
you
see
her
coming
out
of
her
pew
and
regularly
waltzing
in
the
aisle
with
her
eyes
shut
like
a
whirling
dervish
i
positively
believe
it
was
all
that
made
me
ill
i
could
stand
it
i
ca
stand
it
now
i
wo
go
back
to
it
nothing
shall
make
me
yes
you
will
she
rejoined
soothingly
there
nothing
else
to
do
just
put
a
good
face
on
it
and
make
up
your
mind
to
get
through
by
treading
on
as
few
corns
as
possible
and
keeping
your
own
toes
well
in
and
you
be
surprised
how
easy
it
all
come
to
be
you
were
speaking
of
the
revival
business
now
that
exemplifies
just
what
i
was
saying
it
a
part
of
our
machinery
now
a
church
is
like
everything
else
it
got
to
have
a
boss
a
head
an
authority
of
some
sort
that
people
will
listen
to
and
mind
the
catholics
are
different
as
you
say
their
church
is
of
authority
all
the
way
from
the
pope
down
to
the
priest
and
accordingly
they
do
as
they
told
but
the
protestants
your
methodists
most
of
all
they
say
we
wo
have
any
authority
we
wo
obey
any
boss
very
well
what
happens
we
who
are
responsible
for
running
the
thing
and
raising
the
money
and
so
on
we
have
to
put
on
a
spurt
every
once
in
a
while
and
work
up
a
general
state
of
excitement
and
while
it
going
do
you
see
that
that
is
the
authority
the
motive
power
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
by
which
things
are
done
other
denominations
do
need
it
we
do
and
that
why
we
got
but
the
mean
dishonesty
of
it
all
theron
broke
forth
he
moved
about
again
his
bowed
face
drawn
as
with
bodily
suffering
the
tricks
the
hypocrisies
i
feel
as
if
i
could
never
so
much
as
look
at
these
people
here
again
without
oh
now
that
where
you
make
your
mistake
sister
soulsby
put
in
placidly
these
people
of
yours
are
not
a
whit
worse
than
other
people
they
got
their
good
streaks
and
their
bad
streaks
just
like
the
rest
of
us
take
them
by
and
large
they
quite
on
a
par
with
other
folks
the
whole
country
i
do
believe
there
another
congregation
in
the
conference
where
where
this
sort
of
thing
would
have
been
needed
or
i
might
say
tolerated
insisted
theron
perhaps
you
right
the
other
assented
but
that
only
shows
that
your
people
here
are
different
from
the
others
not
that
they
worse
you
do
seem
to
realize
octavius
so
far
as
the
methodists
are
concerned
is
twenty
or
thirty
years
behind
the
times
now
that
has
its
advantages
and
its
disadvantages
the
church
here
is
tough
and
coarse
and
full
of
grit
like
a
grindstone
and
it
does
ministers
from
other
more
places
all
sorts
of
good
to
come
here
once
in
a
while
and
rub
themselves
up
against
it
it
scours
the
rust
and
mildew
off
from
their
piety
and
they
go
back
singing
and
shouting
but
of
course
it
had
a
different
effect
with
you
you
instead
of
and
the
grinding
been
too
rough
and
violent
for
you
but
you
see
what
i
mean
these
people
here
really
take
their
primitive
methodism
seriously
to
them
the
profession
of
entire
sanctification
is
truly
a
genuine
thing
well
do
you
see
when
people
just
know
that
they
saved
it
does
seem
to
them
to
matter
so
much
what
they
do
they
feel
that
ordinary
rules
may
well
be
bent
and
twisted
in
the
interest
of
people
so
supernaturally
good
as
they
are
that
pure
human
nature
it
always
been
like
theron
paused
in
his
walk
to
look
absently
at
her
that
thought
he
said
in
a
vague
slow
way
seems
to
be
springing
up
in
my
path
whichever
way
i
turn
it
oppresses
me
and
yet
it
fascinates
me
this
idea
that
the
dead
men
have
known
more
than
we
know
done
more
than
we
do
that
there
is
nothing
new
anywhere
that
never
mind
the
dead
men
interposed
sister
soulsby
just
you
come
and
sit
down
here
i
hate
to
have
you
straddling
about
the
room
when
trying
to
talk
to
theron
obeyed
and
as
he
sank
into
the
low
seat
sister
soulsby
drew
up
her
chair
and
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
her
gaze
rested
upon
his
with
impressive
steadiness
and
now
i
want
to
talk
seriously
to
you
as
a
friend
she
began
you
must
breathe
to
any
living
soul
the
shadow
of
a
hint
of
this
nonsense
about
leaving
the
ministry
i
could
see
how
you
were
feeling
i
saw
the
book
you
were
reading
the
first
time
i
entered
this
room
and
that
made
me
like
you
only
i
expected
to
find
you
mixing
up
more
worldly
gumption
with
your
renan
well
perhaps
i
like
you
all
the
better
for
not
having
it
for
being
so
delightfully
fresh
at
any
rate
that
made
me
sail
in
and
straighten
your
affairs
for
you
and
now
for
god
sake
keep
them
straight
just
put
all
notions
of
anything
else
out
of
your
head
watch
your
chief
men
and
women
and
be
friends
with
them
keep
your
eye
open
for
what
they
think
you
ought
to
do
and
do
it
have
your
own
ideas
as
much
as
you
like
read
what
you
like
say
under
your
breath
as
much
as
you
like
but
do
let
go
of
your
job
i
knocked
about
too
much
and
i
seen
too
many
promising
young
fellows
cut
their
own
throats
for
pure
moonshine
not
to
have
a
right
to
say
theron
could
not
be
insensible
to
the
friendly
hand
on
his
shoulder
or
to
the
strenuous
sincerity
of
the
voice
which
thus
adjured
him
well
he
said
vaguely
smiling
up
into
her
earnest
eyes
if
we
agree
that
it
is
see
here
she
exclaimed
with
renewed
animation
patting
his
shoulder
in
a
brisk
automatic
way
to
point
the
beginnings
of
her
confidences
i
tell
you
something
it
about
myself
i
got
a
religion
of
my
own
and
it
got
just
one
plank
in
it
and
that
is
that
the
time
to
separate
the
sheep
from
the
goats
is
on
judgment
day
and
that
it
be
done
a
minute
the
young
minister
took
in
the
thought
and
turned
it
about
in
his
mind
and
smiled
upon
it
and
that
brings
me
to
what
i
going
to
tell
you
sister
soulsby
continued
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
crossed
her
knees
so
that
one
and
artistically
shod
foot
poised
itself
close
to
theron
hand
her
eyes
dwelt
upon
his
face
with
an
engaging
candor
i
began
life
she
said
as
a
girl
by
running
away
from
a
stupid
home
with
a
man
that
i
knew
was
married
already
after
that
i
supported
myself
for
a
good
many
years
generally
at
first
on
the
stage
been
a
in
amazon
ballets
and
i
been
leading
lady
in
comic
opera
companies
out
west
i
told
fortunes
in
one
room
of
a
hotel
where
the
biggest
game
of
faro
in
the
territory
went
on
in
another
i
been
a
professional
clairvoyant
and
i
been
a
professional
medium
and
i
been
within
one
vote
of
being
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
and
the
money
that
bought
that
vote
was
put
up
by
the
smartest
and
most
famous
between
omaha
and
a
gentleman
who
died
in
his
boots
and
took
three
sheriff
deputies
along
with
him
to
now
that
my
theron
looked
earnestly
at
her
and
said
nothing
and
now
take
soulsby
she
went
on
of
course
i
take
it
for
granted
there
a
good
deal
that
he
has
never
felt
called
upon
to
mention
he
has
what
you
may
call
a
talkative
temperament
but
there
is
also
a
good
deal
that
i
do
know
he
been
an
actor
too
and
to
this
day
back
him
against
edwin
booth
himself
to
recite
dream
and
he
been
a
medium
and
then
he
was
a
travelling
phrenologist
and
for
a
long
time
he
was
advance
agent
for
a
british
blondes
show
and
when
i
first
saw
him
he
was
lecturing
on
female
diseases
and
he
had
his
little
turn
with
a
grand
jury
too
in
fact
he
was
what
you
may
call
a
regular
bad
old
again
theron
suffered
the
pause
to
lapse
without
comment
save
for
an
amorphous
sort
of
conversation
which
he
felt
to
be
going
on
between
his
eyes
and
those
of
sister
soulsby
well
then
she
resumed
so
much
for
us
apart
now
about
us
together
we
liked
each
other
from
the
start
we
compared
notes
and
we
found
that
we
had
both
soured
on
living
by
fakes
and
that
we
were
tired
of
the
road
and
wanted
to
settle
down
and
be
respectable
in
our
old
age
we
had
a
little
money
enough
to
see
us
through
a
year
or
two
soulsby
had
always
hungered
and
longed
to
own
a
garden
and
raise
flowers
and
had
never
been
able
to
stay
long
enough
in
one
place
to
see
so
much
as
a
ripen
so
we
took
a
little
place
in
a
quiet
country
village
down
on
the
southern
tier
and
he
planted
everything
three
deep
all
over
the
place
and
i
bought
a
roomful
of
cheap
good
books
and
we
started
in
we
took
to
it
like
ducks
to
water
for
a
while
and
i
do
say
that
we
could
have
stood
it
out
just
doing
nothing
to
this
very
day
but
as
luck
would
have
it
during
the
first
winter
there
was
a
revival
at
the
local
methodist
church
and
we
went
every
evening
at
first
just
to
kill
time
and
then
because
we
found
we
liked
the
noise
and
excitement
and
general
racket
of
the
thing
after
it
was
all
over
each
of
us
found
that
the
other
had
been
mighty
near
going
up
to
the
rail
and
joining
the
mourners
and
another
thing
had
occurred
to
each
of
us
too
that
is
what
tremendous
improvements
there
were
possible
in
the
way
that
amateur
revivalist
worked
up
his
business
this
stuck
in
our
crops
and
we
figured
on
it
all
through
the
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
we
finally
went
into
the
thing
tell
me
one
thing
interposed
theron
i
anxious
to
understand
it
all
as
we
go
along
were
you
and
he
at
any
time
sincerely
converted
that
is
i
mean
genuinely
convicted
of
sin
and
conscious
of
you
know
what
i
mean
oh
bless
you
yes
responded
sister
soulsby
not
only
once
dozens
of
times
i
may
say
every
time
we
could
do
good
work
if
we
were
but
that
a
matter
of
temperament
of
precisely
that
was
what
i
was
getting
at
explained
theron
well
then
hear
what
i
was
getting
at
she
went
on
you
were
talking
very
loudly
here
about
frauds
and
hypocrisies
and
so
on
a
few
minutes
ago
now
i
say
that
soulsby
and
i
do
good
and
that
we
good
fellows
now
take
him
for
example
there
is
a
better
citizen
in
all
chemung
county
than
he
is
or
a
kindlier
neighbor
or
a
better
or
more
charitable
man
i
known
him
to
stay
up
a
whole
winter
night
in
a
poor
irishman
stinking
and
freezing
stable
trying
to
save
his
for
him
that
had
been
seized
with
some
sort
of
fit
the
man
whole
livelihood
and
his
family
was
in
that
horse
and
when
it
died
soulsby
bought
him
another
and
never
told
even
me
about
it
now
that
i
call
real
piety
if
you
so
do
i
put
in
theron
cordially
and
this
question
of
fraud
pursued
his
companion
look
at
it
in
this
light
you
heard
us
sing
well
now
i
was
a
singer
of
course
but
soulsby
hardly
knew
one
note
from
another
i
taught
him
to
sing
and
he
went
at
it
patiently
and
diligently
like
a
little
man
and
i
invented
that
scheme
of
finding
tunes
which
the
crowd
did
know
and
so
could
break
in
on
and
smother
i
simply
took
chopin
he
is
full
of
sixths
you
know
and
i
got
all
sorts
of
melodies
out
of
his
waltzes
and
mazurkas
and
nocturnes
and
so
on
and
i
trained
soulsby
just
to
sing
those
sixths
so
as
to
make
the
harmony
and
there
you
are
he
sing
by
himself
any
more
than
a
crow
but
he
got
those
sixths
of
his
down
to
a
hair
now
that
machinery
management
organization
we
take
these
tunes
written
by
a
pole
who
was
living
with
george
sand
openly
at
the
time
and
pass
off
on
the
brethren
for
hymns
it
a
fraud
yes
but
it
a
good
fraud
so
they
are
all
good
frauds
i
say
frankly
that
i
glad
that
the
change
and
the
chance
came
to
help
soulsby
and
me
to
be
good
and
the
point
is
that
i
to
be
a
good
fraud
too
commented
the
young
minister
she
had
risen
and
he
got
to
his
feet
as
well
he
instinctively
sought
for
her
hand
and
pressed
it
warmly
and
held
it
in
both
his
with
an
exuberance
of
gratitude
and
liking
in
his
manner
sister
soulsby
danced
her
eyes
at
him
with
a
saucy
little
shake
of
the
head
i
afraid
you
never
make
a
really
good
fraud
she
said
you
have
got
it
in
you
your
intentions
are
all
right
but
your
execution
is
hopelessly
clumsy
i
came
up
to
your
bedroom
there
twice
while
you
were
sick
just
to
say
and
you
kept
your
eyes
shut
and
all
the
while
a
blind
horse
could
have
told
that
you
were
wide
i
must
have
thought
it
was
my
wife
said
theron
part
iii
chapter
xviii
when
the
lingering
dusk
finally
settled
down
upon
this
long
summer
evening
the
train
bearing
the
soulsbys
homeward
was
already
some
score
of
miles
on
its
way
and
the
methodists
of
octavius
had
nearly
finished
their
weekly
after
the
stirring
events
of
the
revival
it
was
only
to
be
expected
that
this
routine
affair
should
suffer
from
a
reaction
the
attendance
was
larger
than
usual
perhaps
but
the
proceedings
were
spiritless
and
tame
neither
the
pastor
nor
his
wife
was
present
at
the
beginning
and
the
upon
whom
control
devolved
made
but
feeble
headway
against
the
spell
of
inertia
which
the
hot
laid
upon
the
gathering
long
pauses
intervened
between
the
perfunctory
and
supplications
and
the
hymns
weariedly
raised
from
time
to
time
fell
again
in
languor
by
the
wayside
alice
came
in
just
as
people
were
beginning
to
hope
that
some
one
would
start
the
doxology
and
bring
matters
to
a
close
her
appearance
apparently
suggested
this
to
the
for
in
a
few
moments
the
meeting
had
been
dismissed
and
some
of
the
members
on
their
way
out
were
shaking
hands
with
their
minister
wife
and
expressing
the
polite
hope
that
he
was
better
the
worried
look
in
her
face
and
the
obvious
stains
of
recent
tears
upon
her
cheeks
imparted
an
added
point
and
fervor
to
these
inquiries
but
she
replied
to
all
in
tones
of
studied
tranquillity
that
although
not
feeling
well
enough
to
attend
brother
ware
was
steadily
recovering
strength
and
confidently
expected
to
be
in
complete
health
by
sunday
they
left
her
and
could
hardly
wait
to
get
into
the
vestibule
to
ask
one
another
in
whispers
what
on
earth
she
could
have
been
crying
about
meanwhile
brother
ware
improved
his
convalescent
state
by
pacing
slowly
up
and
down
under
the
elms
on
the
side
of
the
street
opposite
the
catholic
church
there
were
no
houses
here
for
a
block
and
more
the
sidewalk
was
broken
in
many
places
so
that
avoided
it
the
overhanging
boughs
shrouded
it
all
in
obscurity
it
was
preeminently
a
place
to
be
alone
in
theron
had
driven
to
the
depot
with
his
guests
an
hour
before
and
after
a
period
of
pleasant
waiting
on
the
platform
had
said
to
them
as
the
train
moved
away
then
he
turned
to
alice
who
had
also
accompanied
them
in
the
carriage
and
was
conscious
of
a
certain
annoyance
at
her
having
come
that
long
familiar
talk
of
the
afternoon
had
given
him
the
feeling
that
he
was
entitled
to
bid
farewell
to
sister
soulsby
to
both
the
soulsbys
by
himself
i
am
afraid
folks
will
think
it
strange
neither
of
us
attending
the
he
said
with
a
suggestion
of
reproof
in
his
tone
as
they
left
the
if
we
get
back
in
time
i
run
in
for
a
minute
answered
alice
with
docility
no
no
he
broke
in
i
not
equal
to
walking
so
fast
you
run
on
ahead
and
explain
matters
and
i
will
come
along
the
hack
we
came
in
is
still
there
in
the
yard
the
wife
suggested
we
could
drive
home
in
that
i
do
believe
it
would
cost
more
than
a
quarter
and
if
you
feeling
badly
but
i
am
not
feeling
badly
theron
replied
with
frank
impatience
only
i
feel
i
feel
that
being
alone
with
my
thoughts
would
be
good
for
oh
certainly
by
all
means
alice
had
said
and
turned
sharply
on
her
heel
being
alone
with
these
thoughts
theron
strolled
aimlessly
about
and
did
not
think
at
all
the
shadows
gathered
and
fireflies
began
to
disclose
their
tiny
gleams
among
the
shrubbery
in
the
gardens
a
came
along
and
passed
him
leaving
in
his
wake
a
straggling
double
line
of
lights
glowing
radiantly
against
the
of
the
trees
this
recalled
to
theron
that
he
had
heard
that
the
town
council
lit
the
street
lamps
by
the
almanac
and
economized
gas
when
moonshine
was
due
the
idea
struck
him
as
droll
and
he
dwelt
upon
it
in
various
aspects
smiling
at
some
of
its
comic
possibilities
looking
up
in
the
middle
of
one
of
these
whimsical
conceits
the
sportive
impulse
died
suddenly
within
him
he
realized
that
it
was
dark
and
that
the
massive
black
bulk
reared
against
the
sky
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
was
the
catholic
church
the
other
fact
that
he
had
been
there
walking
to
and
fro
for
some
time
was
borne
in
upon
him
more
slowly
he
turned
and
resumed
the
pacing
up
and
down
with
a
still
more
leisurely
step
musing
upon
the
curious
way
in
which
people
minds
all
unconsciously
follow
about
where
instincts
and
intuitions
lead
no
doubt
it
was
what
sister
soulsby
had
said
about
catholics
which
had
insensibly
guided
his
purposeless
stroll
in
this
direction
what
a
woman
that
was
somehow
the
purport
of
her
talk
striking
and
even
astonishing
as
he
had
found
it
did
not
stand
out
so
clearly
in
his
memory
as
did
the
image
of
the
woman
herself
she
must
have
been
extremely
pretty
once
for
that
matter
she
still
was
a
most
woman
it
had
been
a
genuine
pleasure
to
have
her
in
the
house
to
see
her
intelligent
responsive
face
at
the
table
to
have
it
in
one
power
to
make
drafts
at
will
upon
the
fund
of
sympathy
and
appreciation
of
facile
mirth
and
ready
tenderness
in
those
big
eyes
of
hers
he
liked
that
phrase
she
had
used
about
herself
a
good
it
seemed
to
fit
her
to
a
and
soulsby
was
a
good
fellow
too
all
at
once
it
occurred
to
him
to
wonder
whether
they
were
married
or
not
but
really
that
was
no
affair
of
his
he
reflected
a
citizen
of
the
intellectual
world
should
be
above
soiling
his
thoughts
with
mean
curiosities
of
that
sort
and
he
drove
the
impertinent
query
down
again
under
the
surface
of
his
mind
he
refused
to
tolerate
as
well
sundry
vagrant
imaginings
which
rose
to
cluster
about
and
literalize
the
romance
of
her
youth
which
sister
soulsby
had
so
frankly
outlined
he
would
think
upon
nothing
but
her
as
he
knew
her
the
kindly
capable
and
charming
woman
who
had
made
such
a
brilliant
break
in
the
monotony
of
life
at
that
dull
parsonage
of
his
the
only
genuine
happiness
in
life
must
consist
in
having
bright
smart
attractive
women
like
that
always
about
the
lights
were
visible
now
in
the
upper
rooms
of
father
pastorate
across
the
way
theron
paused
for
a
second
to
consider
whether
he
wanted
to
go
over
and
call
on
the
priest
he
decided
that
mentally
he
was
too
fagged
and
flat
for
such
an
undertaking
he
needed
another
sort
of
companionship
some
restful
soothing
human
contact
which
should
exact
nothing
from
him
in
return
but
just
take
charge
of
him
with
soft
wise
words
and
pleasant
plays
of
fancy
and
jokes
and
and
something
of
the
general
effect
created
by
sister
eyes
the
thought
expanded
itself
and
he
saw
that
he
had
never
realized
before
nay
never
dreamt
before
what
a
mighty
part
the
comradeship
of
talented
and
beautiful
women
must
play
in
the
development
of
genius
the
achievement
of
lofty
aims
out
in
the
great
world
of
great
men
to
know
such
women
ah
that
would
never
fall
to
his
hapless
lot
the
priest
lamps
blinked
at
him
through
the
trees
he
remembered
that
priests
were
supposed
to
be
even
further
removed
from
the
possibilities
of
such
contact
than
he
was
himself
his
memory
reverted
to
that
horribly
ugly
old
woman
whom
father
forbes
had
spoken
of
as
his
housekeeper
life
under
the
same
roof
with
such
a
hag
must
be
even
worse
than
worse
than
the
young
minister
did
not
finish
the
comparison
even
in
the
privacy
of
his
inner
soul
he
stood
instead
staring
over
at
the
pastorate
in
a
kind
of
stupor
of
arrested
thought
the
figure
of
a
woman
passed
in
view
at
the
nearest
window
a
tall
figure
with
pale
summer
clothes
of
some
sort
and
a
broad
summer
hat
a
flitting
effect
of
diaphanous
shadow
between
him
and
the
light
which
streamed
from
the
casement
theron
felt
a
little
shiver
run
over
him
as
if
the
delicate
coolness
of
the
changing
had
got
into
his
blood
the
window
was
open
and
his
strained
hearing
thought
it
caught
the
sound
of
faint
laughter
he
continued
to
gaze
at
the
place
where
the
vision
had
appeared
the
while
a
novel
and
strange
perception
unfolded
itself
upon
his
mind
he
had
come
there
in
the
hope
of
encountering
celia
madden
now
that
he
looked
this
fact
in
the
face
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
it
in
truth
it
was
simplicity
itself
he
was
still
a
sick
man
weak
in
body
and
dejected
in
spirits
the
thought
of
how
unhappy
and
unstrung
he
was
came
to
him
now
with
an
insistent
pathos
that
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
he
was
only
obeying
the
universal
law
of
nature
the
law
which
prompts
the
pallid
spindling
sprout
of
the
potato
in
the
cellar
to
strive
feebly
toward
the
light
from
where
he
stood
in
the
darkness
he
stretched
out
his
hands
in
the
direction
of
that
open
window
the
gesture
was
his
confession
to
the
overhanging
boughs
to
the
soft
to
the
stars
above
and
it
bore
back
to
him
something
of
the
confessional
vague
and
wistful
solace
he
seemed
already
to
have
drawn
down
into
his
soul
a
taste
of
the
refreshment
it
craved
he
sighed
deeply
and
the
hot
moisture
smarted
again
upon
his
eyelids
but
this
time
not
all
in
grief
with
his
tender
compassion
for
himself
there
mingled
now
a
flutter
of
buoyant
prescience
of
exquisite
expectancy
fate
walked
abroad
this
summer
night
the
street
door
of
the
pastorate
opened
and
in
the
flood
of
illumination
which
spread
suddenly
forth
over
the
steps
and
sidewalk
theron
saw
again
the
tall
form
with
the
indefinitely
flowing
garments
and
the
wide
straw
hat
he
heard
a
tuneful
woman
voice
call
out
maggie
and
caught
no
response
save
the
abrupt
closing
of
the
door
which
turned
everything
black
again
with
a
bang
he
listened
acutely
for
another
instant
and
then
with
long
noiseless
strides
made
his
way
down
his
deserted
side
of
the
street
he
moderated
his
pace
as
he
turned
to
cross
the
road
at
the
corner
and
then
still
masked
by
the
trees
halted
altogether
in
a
momentary
tumult
of
apprehension
no
yes
it
was
all
right
the
girl
sauntered
out
from
the
total
darkness
into
the
dim
starlight
of
the
open
corner
why
bless
me
is
that
you
miss
madden
celia
seemed
to
discern
readily
enough
through
the
accents
of
surprise
the
identity
of
the
tall
slim
man
who
addressed
her
from
the
shadows
ware
she
said
with
prompt
affability
i
so
glad
to
find
you
out
again
we
heard
you
were
i
have
been
very
ill
responded
theron
as
they
shook
hands
and
walked
on
together
he
added
with
a
quaver
in
his
voice
i
am
still
far
from
strong
i
really
ought
not
to
be
out
at
all
but
but
the
longing
for
for
well
i
could
stay
in
any
longer
even
if
it
kills
me
i
shall
be
glad
i
came
out
oh
we
wo
talk
of
killing
said
celia
i
do
believe
in
illnesses
but
you
believe
in
collapses
of
the
nerves
put
in
theron
with
gentle
sadness
in
moral
and
spiritual
and
mental
breakdowns
i
remember
how
i
was
touched
by
the
way
you
told
me
you
suffered
from
them
i
had
to
take
what
you
said
then
for
granted
i
had
had
no
experience
of
it
myself
but
now
i
know
what
it
he
drew
a
long
pathetic
sigh
oh
do
i
know
what
it
is
he
repeated
gloomily
come
my
friend
cheer
up
celia
purred
at
him
in
soothing
tones
he
felt
that
there
was
a
deliciously
feminine
and
sisterly
intuition
in
her
speech
and
in
the
helpful
way
in
which
she
drew
his
arm
through
hers
he
leaned
upon
this
support
and
was
glad
of
it
in
every
fibre
of
his
being
do
you
remember
you
promised
that
last
time
i
saw
you
to
play
for
me
he
reminded
her
they
were
passing
the
little
covered
postern
door
at
the
side
and
rear
of
the
church
as
he
spoke
and
he
made
a
half
halt
to
point
the
coincidence
oh
there
no
one
to
blow
the
organ
she
said
divining
his
suggestion
and
i
have
the
key
and
besides
the
organ
is
too
heavy
and
severe
for
an
invalid
it
would
overwhelm
you
not
as
you
would
know
how
to
play
it
for
me
urged
theron
pensively
i
feel
as
if
good
music
would
make
me
well
again
i
am
really
very
ill
and
weak
and
unhappy
the
girl
seemed
moved
by
the
despairing
note
in
his
voice
she
invited
him
by
a
sympathetic
gesture
to
lean
even
more
directly
on
her
arm
come
home
with
me
and
i
play
chopin
to
you
she
said
in
compassionate
friendliness
he
is
the
real
medicine
for
bruised
and
wounded
nerves
you
shall
have
as
much
of
him
as
you
the
idea
thus
unexpectedly
thrown
forth
spread
itself
like
some
vast
and
inexpressibly
alluring
vista
before
theron
imagination
the
spice
of
adventure
in
it
fascinated
his
mind
as
well
but
for
a
shrinking
moment
the
flesh
was
weak
i
afraid
your
people
would
would
think
it
strange
he
faltered
and
began
also
to
recall
that
he
had
some
people
of
his
own
who
would
be
even
more
amazed
nonsense
said
celia
in
fine
bold
confidence
and
with
a
reassuring
pressure
on
his
arm
i
allow
none
of
my
people
to
question
what
i
do
they
never
dream
of
such
a
preposterous
thing
besides
you
will
see
none
of
them
madden
is
at
the
seaside
and
my
father
and
brother
have
their
own
part
of
the
house
i
sha
listen
for
a
minute
to
your
not
coming
come
i
your
doctor
i
to
make
you
well
there
was
further
conversation
and
theron
more
or
less
knew
that
he
was
bearing
a
part
in
it
but
his
whole
mind
seemed
concentrated
in
a
sort
of
delicious
terror
upon
the
wonderful
experience
to
which
every
footstep
brought
him
nearer
his
magnetized
fancy
pictured
a
great
spacious
parlor
such
as
a
mansion
like
the
maddens
would
of
course
contain
and
there
would
be
a
grand
piano
and
lace
curtains
and
paintings
in
gold
frames
and
a
chandelier
and
velvet
and
he
would
sit
in
one
of
these
surrounded
by
all
the
luxury
of
the
rich
while
celia
played
to
him
there
would
be
servants
about
he
presumed
and
very
likely
they
would
recognize
him
and
of
course
they
would
talk
about
it
to
tom
dick
and
harry
afterward
but
he
said
to
himself
defiantly
that
he
did
care
he
withdrew
his
arm
from
hers
as
they
came
upon
the
main
street
he
passed
no
one
who
seemed
to
know
him
presently
they
came
to
the
madden
place
and
celia
without
waiting
for
the
gravelled
walk
struck
obliquely
across
the
lawn
theron
who
had
been
lagging
behind
with
a
certain
circumspection
stepped
briskly
to
her
side
now
their
progress
over
the
soft
turf
in
the
dark
together
with
the
scent
of
lilies
and
perfumed
shrubs
heavy
on
the
night
air
and
the
majestic
bulk
of
the
big
silent
house
rising
among
the
trees
before
them
gave
him
a
thrilling
sense
of
the
glory
of
individual
freedom
i
feel
a
new
man
already
he
declared
as
they
swung
along
on
the
grass
he
breathed
a
long
sigh
of
content
and
drew
nearer
so
that
their
shoulders
touched
now
and
again
as
they
walked
in
a
minute
more
they
were
standing
on
the
doorstep
and
theron
heard
the
significant
jingle
of
a
bunch
of
keys
which
his
companion
was
groping
for
in
her
elusive
pocket
he
was
conscious
of
trembling
a
little
at
the
sound
it
seemed
that
unlike
other
people
the
maddens
did
not
have
their
parlor
on
the
opening
off
the
front
hall
theron
stood
in
the
complete
darkness
of
this
hall
till
celia
had
lit
one
of
several
candles
which
were
in
their
on
a
sort
of
sideboard
next
the
she
beckoned
him
with
a
gesture
of
her
head
and
he
followed
her
up
a
broad
staircase
magnificent
in
its
structural
appointments
of
inlaid
woods
and
carpeted
with
what
to
his
feet
felt
like
down
the
tiny
light
which
his
guide
bore
before
her
half
revealed
as
they
passed
in
their
ascent
tall
lengths
of
tapestry
and
the
dull
glint
of
armor
and
brazen
discs
in
shadowed
niches
on
the
nearer
wall
over
the
lay
an
open
space
of
such
stately
dimensions
bounded
by
terminal
lines
of
decoration
so
distant
in
the
faint
that
the
young
country
minister
could
think
of
no
word
but
palatial
to
fit
it
all
at
the
head
of
the
flight
celia
led
the
way
along
a
wide
corridor
to
where
it
ended
here
stretched
from
side
to
side
and
suspended
from
broad
hoops
of
a
metal
was
a
thick
curtain
of
a
uniform
color
which
theron
at
first
thought
was
green
and
then
decided
must
be
blue
she
pushed
its
heavy
folds
aside
and
unlocked
another
door
he
passed
under
the
curtain
behind
her
and
closed
the
door
the
room
into
which
he
had
made
his
way
was
not
at
all
after
the
fashion
of
any
parlor
he
had
ever
seen
in
the
obscure
light
it
was
difficult
to
tell
what
it
resembled
he
made
out
what
he
took
to
be
a
easel
standing
forth
independently
in
the
centre
of
things
there
were
rows
of
books
on
rude
low
shelves
against
one
of
the
two
windows
was
a
big
flat
or
was
it
a
littered
with
papers
under
the
other
window
was
a
carpenter
bench
with
a
large
mound
of
something
at
one
end
covered
with
a
white
cloth
on
a
table
behind
the
easel
rose
a
tall
mechanical
contrivance
the
chief
feature
of
which
was
a
thick
upright
spiral
screw
the
floor
was
of
bare
wood
stained
brown
the
walls
of
this
queer
room
had
photographs
and
pictures
taken
apparently
from
illustrated
papers
pinned
up
at
random
for
their
only
ornament
celia
had
lighted
three
or
four
other
candles
on
the
mantel
she
caught
the
dumfounded
expression
with
which
her
guest
was
surveying
his
surroundings
and
gave
a
merry
little
laugh
this
is
my
workshop
she
explained
i
keep
this
for
the
things
i
do
badly
things
i
fool
with
if
i
want
to
paint
or
model
in
clay
or
bind
books
or
write
or
draw
or
turn
on
the
lathe
or
do
some
carpentering
here
where
i
do
it
all
the
things
that
make
a
mess
which
has
to
be
cleaned
up
they
are
kept
out
here
because
this
is
as
far
as
the
servants
are
allowed
to
she
unlocked
still
another
door
as
she
spoke
a
door
which
was
also
concealed
behind
a
curtain
now
she
said
holding
up
the
candle
so
that
its
reddish
flare
rounded
with
warmth
the
creamy
fulness
of
her
chin
and
throat
and
glowed
upon
her
hair
in
a
flame
of
orange
light
now
i
will
show
you
what
is
my
very
chapter
xix
theron
ware
looked
about
him
with
frankly
undisguised
astonishment
the
room
in
which
he
found
himself
was
so
dark
at
first
that
it
yielded
little
to
the
eye
and
that
little
seemed
altogether
beyond
his
comprehension
his
gaze
helplessly
followed
celia
and
her
candle
about
as
she
busied
herself
in
the
work
of
illumination
when
she
had
finished
and
pinched
out
the
taper
there
were
seven
lights
in
the
apartment
lights
beaming
softly
through
alternating
rectangles
of
blue
and
yellow
glass
they
must
be
set
in
some
sort
of
lanterns
around
against
the
wall
he
thought
but
the
shape
of
these
he
could
hardly
make
out
gradually
his
sight
adapted
itself
to
this
subdued
light
and
he
began
to
see
other
things
these
queer
lamps
were
placed
apparently
so
as
to
shed
a
special
radiance
upon
some
statues
which
stood
in
the
corners
of
the
chamber
and
upon
some
pictures
which
were
embedded
in
the
walls
theron
noted
that
the
statues
the
marble
of
which
lost
its
aggressive
whiteness
under
the
tinted
lights
were
mostly
of
naked
men
and
women
the
pictures
four
or
five
in
number
were
all
variations
of
a
single
theme
the
virgin
mary
and
the
child
a
less
untutored
vision
than
his
would
have
caught
more
swiftly
the
scheme
of
color
and
line
in
which
these
works
of
art
bore
their
share
the
walls
of
the
room
were
in
part
of
flat
upright
wooden
columns
terminating
high
above
in
simple
capitals
and
they
were
all
painted
in
pale
amber
and
straw
and
primrose
hues
irregularly
wavering
here
and
there
toward
suggestions
of
white
between
these
pilasters
were
broader
panels
of
stamped
leather
in
gently
varying
shades
of
peacock
blue
these
contrasted
colors
vaguely
interwove
and
mingled
in
what
he
could
see
of
the
shadowed
ceiling
far
above
they
were
repeated
in
the
draperies
and
huge
cushions
and
pillows
of
the
low
wide
divan
which
ran
about
three
sides
of
the
room
even
the
floor
where
it
revealed
itself
among
the
scattered
rugs
was
laid
in
a
mosaic
pattern
of
matched
woods
which
like
the
rugs
gave
back
these
same
shifting
blues
and
uncertain
yellows
the
fourth
side
of
the
apartment
was
broken
in
outline
at
one
end
by
the
door
through
which
they
had
entered
and
at
the
other
by
a
broad
square
opening
hung
with
curtains
of
a
thin
silken
stuff
between
the
two
apertures
rose
against
the
wall
what
theron
took
at
first
glance
to
be
an
altar
there
were
pyramidal
rows
of
tall
candles
here
on
either
side
each
masked
with
a
little
silken
hood
below
in
the
centre
a
projection
supported
what
seemed
a
massive
carved
casket
and
in
the
beautiful
intricacies
of
this
and
the
receding
canopy
of
delicate
ornamentation
which
depended
above
it
the
dominant
color
was
white
deepening
away
in
its
shadows
by
tenderly
minute
gradations
to
the
tints
which
ruled
the
rest
of
the
room
celia
lighted
some
of
the
high
thick
tapers
in
these
candelabra
and
opened
the
top
of
the
casket
theron
saw
with
surprise
that
she
had
uncovered
the
keyboard
of
a
piano
he
viewed
with
much
greater
amazement
her
next
proceeding
which
was
to
put
a
cigarette
between
her
lips
and
bending
over
one
of
the
candles
with
it
for
an
instant
turn
to
him
with
a
filmy
opalescent
veil
of
smoke
above
her
head
make
yourself
comfortable
anywhere
she
said
with
a
gesture
which
comprehended
all
the
divans
and
pillows
in
the
place
will
you
smoke
i
have
never
tried
since
i
was
a
little
boy
said
theron
but
i
think
i
could
if
you
do
mind
i
should
like
to
lounging
at
his
ease
on
the
oriental
couch
theron
experimented
cautiously
upon
the
unaccustomed
tobacco
and
looked
at
celia
with
what
he
felt
to
be
the
confident
quiet
of
a
man
of
the
world
she
had
thrown
aside
her
hat
and
in
doing
so
had
half
released
some
of
the
heavy
strands
of
hair
coiled
at
the
back
of
her
head
his
glance
instinctively
rested
upon
this
wonderful
hair
of
hers
there
was
no
mistaking
the
sudden
fascination
its
disorder
had
for
his
eye
she
stood
before
him
with
the
cigarette
poised
daintily
between
thumb
and
finger
of
a
shapely
hand
and
smiled
comprehendingly
down
on
her
guest
i
suffered
the
horrors
of
the
damned
with
this
hair
of
mine
when
i
was
a
child
she
said
i
daresay
all
children
have
a
taste
for
persecuting
but
it
a
specialty
with
irish
children
they
get
hold
somehow
of
an
ancient
national
superstition
or
legend
that
red
hair
was
brought
into
ireland
by
the
danes
it
been
a
term
of
reproach
with
us
since
brian
boru
time
to
call
a
child
a
dane
i
used
to
be
pursued
and
baited
with
it
every
day
of
my
life
until
the
one
dream
of
my
ambition
was
to
get
old
enough
to
be
a
sister
of
charity
so
that
i
might
hide
my
hair
under
one
of
their
big
beastly
white
linen
caps
got
rather
away
from
that
ideal
since
i
afraid
she
added
with
a
droll
downward
curl
of
her
lip
your
hair
is
very
beautiful
said
theron
in
the
calm
tone
of
a
connoisseur
i
like
it
myself
celia
admitted
and
blew
a
little
toward
him
i
made
this
whole
room
to
match
it
the
colors
i
mean
she
explained
in
deference
to
his
uplifted
brows
between
us
we
make
up
what
whistler
would
call
a
symphony
that
reminds
me
i
was
going
to
play
for
you
let
me
finish
the
cigarette
theron
felt
grateful
for
her
reticence
about
the
fact
that
he
had
laid
his
own
aside
i
have
never
seen
a
room
at
all
like
this
he
remarked
you
are
right
it
does
fit
you
she
nodded
her
sense
of
his
appreciation
it
is
what
i
like
she
said
it
expresses
me
i
will
not
have
anything
about
me
or
anybody
either
that
i
do
like
i
suppose
if
an
old
greek
could
see
it
it
would
make
him
sick
but
it
represents
what
i
mean
by
being
a
greek
it
is
as
near
as
an
irishman
can
get
to
i
remember
your
puzzling
me
by
saying
that
you
were
a
celia
laughed
and
tossed
the
away
i
puzzle
you
more
i
afraid
if
i
tried
to
explain
to
you
what
i
really
meant
by
it
i
divide
people
up
into
two
classes
you
know
greeks
and
jews
once
you
get
hold
of
that
principle
all
other
divisions
and
classifications
such
as
by
race
or
language
or
nationality
seem
pure
foolishness
it
is
the
only
true
division
there
is
it
is
just
as
true
among
negroes
or
wild
indians
who
never
heard
of
greece
or
jerusalem
as
it
is
among
white
folks
that
is
the
beauty
of
it
it
works
everywhere
try
it
on
me
urged
theron
with
a
twinkling
eye
which
am
i
both
said
the
girl
with
a
merry
nod
of
the
head
but
now
i
play
i
told
you
you
were
to
hear
chopin
i
prescribe
him
for
you
he
is
the
greekiest
of
the
greeks
there
was
a
nation
where
all
the
people
were
artists
where
everybody
was
an
intellectual
aristocrat
where
the
philistine
was
as
unknown
as
extinct
as
the
dodo
chopin
might
have
written
his
music
for
i
am
interested
in
shopang
put
in
theron
suddenly
recalling
sister
soulsby
confidences
as
to
the
source
of
her
tunes
he
lived
with
what
his
name
george
something
we
were
speaking
about
him
only
this
celia
looked
down
into
her
visitor
face
at
first
inquiringly
then
with
a
latent
grin
about
her
lips
yes
george
something
she
said
in
a
tone
which
mystified
him
the
rev
ware
was
sitting
up
a
minute
afterward
in
a
ferment
of
awakened
consciousness
that
he
had
never
heard
the
piano
played
before
after
a
little
he
noiselessly
rearranged
the
cushions
and
settled
himself
again
in
a
recumbent
posture
it
was
beyond
his
strength
to
follow
that
first
impulse
and
keep
his
mind
abreast
with
what
his
ears
took
in
he
sighed
and
lay
back
and
surrendered
his
senses
to
the
mere
unthinking
charm
of
it
all
it
was
the
fourth
prelude
that
was
singing
in
the
air
about
him
a
simple
plaintive
strain
wandering
at
will
over
a
surface
of
steady
rhythmic
movement
underneath
always
creeping
upward
through
mysteries
of
sweetness
always
sinking
again
in
cadences
of
with
only
a
moment
pause
there
came
the
seventh
waltz
a
rich
bold
confusion
which
yet
was
not
confused
theron
ears
dwelt
with
eager
delight
upon
the
chasing
medley
of
swift
tinkling
sounds
but
it
left
his
thoughts
free
from
where
he
reclined
he
turned
his
head
to
scrutinize
one
by
one
the
statues
in
the
corners
no
doubt
they
were
beautiful
for
this
was
a
department
in
which
he
was
all
humility
and
one
of
them
the
figure
of
a
stately
though
woman
bending
slightly
forward
and
with
both
arms
broken
off
was
decently
robed
from
the
hips
downward
the
others
were
not
robed
at
all
theron
stared
at
them
with
the
erratic
rippling
jangle
of
the
waltz
in
his
ears
and
felt
that
he
possessed
a
new
and
disturbing
conception
of
what
female
emancipation
meant
in
these
later
days
roving
along
the
wall
his
glance
rested
again
upon
the
largest
of
the
virgin
pictures
a
figure
in
sweeping
draperies
its
radiant
aureoled
head
upturned
in
rapt
adoration
its
feet
resting
on
a
crescent
moon
which
shone
forth
in
bluish
silver
through
festooned
clouds
of
cherubs
the
incongruity
between
the
unashamed
statues
and
this
serene
incarnation
of
holy
womanhood
jarred
upon
him
for
the
instant
then
his
mind
went
to
the
piano
without
a
break
the
waltz
had
slowed
and
expanded
into
a
passage
of
what
might
be
church
music
an
exquisitely
modulated
and
gently
solemn
chant
through
which
a
soft
lingering
song
roved
capriciously
forcing
the
listener
to
wonder
where
it
was
coming
out
even
while
it
caressed
and
soothed
to
repose
he
looked
from
the
madonna
to
celia
beyond
the
carelessly
drooping
braids
and
coils
of
hair
which
blazed
between
the
candles
he
could
see
the
outline
of
her
brow
and
cheek
the
noble
contour
of
her
lifted
chin
and
full
modelled
throat
all
pink
as
the
most
delicate
rose
leaf
is
pink
against
the
cool
lights
of
the
wall
the
sight
convicted
him
in
the
court
of
his
own
soul
as
a
prurient
and
rustic
in
the
presence
of
such
a
face
of
such
music
there
ceased
to
be
any
such
thing
as
nudity
and
statues
no
more
needed
clothes
than
did
those
slow
deep
magnificent
chords
which
came
now
gravely
accumulating
their
spell
upon
him
it
is
all
singing
the
player
called
out
to
him
over
her
shoulder
in
a
minute
of
rest
that
is
what
chopin
does
he
sings
she
began
with
an
effect
of
thinking
of
something
else
the
sixth
nocturne
and
theron
at
first
thought
she
was
not
playing
anything
in
particular
so
deliberately
haltingly
did
the
chain
of
charm
unwind
itself
into
sequence
then
it
came
closer
to
him
than
the
others
had
done
the
dreamy
wistful
meditative
beauty
of
it
all
at
once
oppressed
and
inspired
him
he
saw
celia
shoulders
sway
under
the
impulse
of
the
rubato
license
the
privilege
to
invest
each
measure
with
the
stress
of
the
whole
to
loiter
to
weep
to
run
and
laugh
at
will
and
the
music
she
made
spoke
to
him
as
with
a
human
voice
there
was
the
wooing
sense
of
roses
and
moonlight
of
perfumes
white
skins
alluring
languorous
eyes
and
then
you
know
this
part
of
course
he
heard
her
say
on
the
instant
they
had
stepped
from
the
dark
scented
starlit
garden
where
the
nightingale
sang
into
a
great
cathedral
a
sombre
and
lofty
anthem
arose
and
filled
the
place
with
the
splendor
of
such
dignified
pomp
of
harmony
and
such
suggestions
of
measureless
choral
power
and
authority
that
theron
sat
abruptly
up
then
was
drawn
resistlessly
to
his
feet
he
stood
motionless
in
the
strange
room
feeling
most
of
all
that
one
should
kneel
to
hear
such
music
this
you
know
too
the
funeral
march
from
the
second
sonata
she
was
saying
before
he
realized
that
the
end
of
the
other
had
come
he
sank
upon
the
divan
again
bending
forward
and
clasping
his
hands
tight
around
his
knees
his
heart
beat
furiously
as
he
listened
to
the
weird
mediaeval
processional
with
its
wild
clashing
chords
held
down
in
the
bondage
of
an
orderly
sadness
there
was
a
propelling
motion
in
the
thing
a
sense
of
being
borne
bodily
along
which
affected
him
like
dizziness
he
breathed
hard
through
the
robust
portions
of
stern
vigorous
noise
and
rocked
himself
to
and
fro
when
as
rosy
morn
breaks
upon
a
night
the
drums
are
silenced
for
the
sweet
comforting
strain
of
solitary
melody
the
clanging
minor
harmonies
into
which
the
march
relapses
came
to
their
abrupt
end
theron
rose
once
more
and
moved
with
a
hesitating
step
to
the
piano
i
want
to
rest
a
little
he
said
with
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
whew
so
do
i
exclaimed
celia
letting
her
hands
fall
with
an
exaggerated
gesture
of
weariness
the
sonatas
take
it
out
of
one
they
are
hideously
difficult
you
know
they
are
rarely
i
did
know
remarked
theron
she
seemed
not
to
mind
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
he
kept
it
there
i
did
know
anything
about
music
at
all
what
i
do
know
now
is
that
that
this
evening
is
an
event
in
my
she
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled
he
read
unsuspected
tendernesses
and
tolerances
of
friendship
in
the
depths
of
her
eyes
which
emboldened
him
to
stir
the
fingers
of
that
audacious
hand
in
a
lingering
caressing
trill
upon
her
shoulder
the
movement
was
of
the
faintest
but
having
ventured
it
he
drew
his
hand
abruptly
away
you
are
getting
on
she
said
to
him
there
was
an
enigmatic
twinkle
in
the
smile
with
which
she
continued
to
regard
him
we
are
hellenizing
you
at
a
great
a
sudden
thought
seemed
to
strike
her
she
shifted
her
eyes
toward
vacancy
with
a
swift
abstracted
glance
reflected
for
a
moment
then
let
a
sparkling
and
the
dimpling
beginnings
of
an
almost
roguish
smile
mark
her
assent
to
the
conceit
whatever
it
might
be
i
will
be
with
you
in
a
moment
he
heard
her
say
and
while
the
words
were
still
in
his
ears
she
had
risen
and
passed
out
of
sight
through
the
broad
open
doorway
to
the
right
the
looped
curtains
fell
together
behind
her
presently
a
mellow
light
spread
over
their
delicately
translucent
surface
a
creamy
undulating
radiance
which
gave
the
effect
of
moving
about
among
the
myriad
folds
of
the
silk
theron
gazed
at
these
curtains
for
a
little
then
straightened
his
shoulders
with
a
gesture
of
decision
and
turning
on
his
heel
went
over
and
examined
the
statues
in
the
further
corners
minutely
if
you
would
like
some
more
i
will
play
you
the
berceuse
her
voice
came
to
him
with
a
delicious
shock
he
wheeled
round
and
beheld
her
standing
at
the
piano
with
one
hand
resting
palm
upward
on
the
keys
she
was
facing
him
her
tall
form
was
robed
now
in
some
shapeless
clinging
drapery
lustrous
and
creamy
and
exquisitely
soft
like
the
curtains
the
wonderful
hair
hung
free
and
luxuriant
about
her
neck
and
shoulders
and
glowed
with
an
intensity
of
fiery
color
which
made
all
the
other
hues
of
the
room
pale
and
vague
a
fillet
of
faint
blue
drew
a
gracious
span
through
the
flame
of
red
above
her
temples
and
from
this
there
rose
the
gleam
of
jewels
her
head
inclined
gently
gravely
toward
him
with
the
posture
of
that
armless
woman
in
marble
he
had
been
studying
and
her
brown
eyes
regarding
him
from
the
shadows
emitted
light
it
is
a
lullaby
the
only
one
he
wrote
she
said
as
theron
and
with
tightened
lips
approached
her
no
you
stand
there
she
added
sinking
into
the
seat
before
the
instrument
go
back
and
sit
where
you
the
most
perfect
of
lullabies
with
its
swaying
abandonment
to
cooing
rhythm
ever
and
again
rising
in
ripples
to
the
point
of
insisting
on
something
one
knows
not
what
and
then
rocking
melting
away
once
more
passed
so
to
speak
over
theron
head
he
leaned
back
upon
the
cushions
and
watched
the
white
rounded
forearm
which
the
falling
folds
of
this
strange
drapery
made
bare
there
was
more
that
appealed
to
his
mood
in
the
third
ballade
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
were
words
going
along
with
it
incoherent
and
impulsive
yet
very
earnest
words
appealing
to
him
in
strenuous
argument
and
persuasion
each
time
he
almost
knew
what
they
said
and
strained
after
their
meaning
with
a
passionate
desire
and
then
there
would
come
a
kind
of
cuckoo
call
and
everything
would
swing
dancing
off
again
into
a
mockery
of
inconsequence
upon
the
silence
there
fell
the
pure
liquid
mellifluous
melody
of
a
woman
singing
to
her
lover
it
is
like
heine
simply
a
said
the
girl
over
her
shoulder
theron
followed
now
with
all
his
senses
as
she
carried
the
ninth
nocturne
onward
the
stormy
passage
which
she
banged
finely
forth
was
in
truth
a
lover
quarrel
and
then
the
mild
placid
flow
of
sweet
harmonies
into
which
the
furore
sank
dying
languorously
away
upon
a
silence
all
alive
with
tender
memories
of
sound
was
that
not
also
a
part
of
love
they
sat
motionless
through
a
minute
the
man
on
the
divan
the
girl
at
the
piano
and
theron
listened
for
what
he
felt
must
be
the
audible
thumping
of
his
heart
then
throwing
back
her
head
with
upturned
face
celia
began
what
she
had
withheld
for
the
last
the
sixteenth
mazurka
this
strange
foreign
thing
she
played
with
her
eyes
closed
her
head
tilted
obliquely
so
that
theron
could
see
the
beautiful
countenance
framed
as
if
asleep
in
the
billowing
luxuriance
of
unloosed
auburn
hair
he
fancied
her
beholding
visions
as
she
wrought
the
music
visions
full
of
barbaric
color
and
romantic
forms
as
his
mind
swam
along
with
the
gliding
tricksy
phantom
of
a
tune
it
seemed
as
if
he
too
could
see
these
visions
as
if
he
gazed
at
them
through
her
eyes
it
could
not
be
helped
he
lifted
himself
noiselessly
to
his
feet
and
stole
with
caution
toward
her
he
would
hear
the
rest
of
this
weird
voluptuous
fantasy
standing
thus
so
close
behind
her
that
he
could
look
down
upon
her
full
uplifted
lace
so
close
that
if
she
moved
that
glowing
nimbus
of
hair
would
touch
him
there
had
been
some
curious
and
awkward
pauses
in
this
last
piece
which
theron
by
some
side
cerebration
had
put
down
to
her
not
watching
what
her
fingers
did
there
came
another
of
these
pauses
now
an
odd
unaccountable
halt
in
what
seemed
the
middle
of
everything
he
stared
intently
down
upon
her
statuesque
dreaming
face
during
the
hush
and
caught
his
breath
as
he
waited
there
fell
at
last
a
few
faltering
ascending
notes
making
a
strain
and
then
again
there
was
silence
celia
opened
her
eyes
and
poured
a
direct
deep
gaze
into
the
face
above
hers
its
pale
lips
were
parted
in
suspense
and
the
color
had
faded
from
its
cheeks
that
is
the
end
she
said
and
with
a
turn
of
her
lithe
body
stood
swiftly
up
even
while
the
echoes
of
the
broken
melody
seemed
panting
in
the
air
about
her
for
completion
theron
put
his
hands
to
his
face
and
pressed
them
tightly
against
eyes
and
brow
for
an
instant
then
throwing
them
aside
with
an
expansive
downward
sweep
of
the
arms
and
holding
them
clenched
he
returned
celia
glance
it
was
as
if
he
had
never
looked
into
a
woman
eyes
before
it
ca
be
the
end
he
heard
himself
saying
in
a
low
voice
charged
with
deep
significance
he
held
her
gaze
in
the
grasp
of
his
with
implacable
tenacity
there
was
a
trouble
about
breathing
and
the
mosaic
floor
seemed
to
stir
under
his
feet
he
clung
defiantly
to
the
one
idea
of
not
releasing
her
eyes
how
could
it
be
the
end
he
demanded
lifting
an
uncertain
hand
to
his
breast
as
he
spoke
and
spreading
it
there
as
if
to
control
the
tumultuous
fluttering
of
his
heart
things
do
end
that
way
a
sharp
blinding
spasm
of
giddiness
closed
upon
and
shook
him
while
the
brave
words
were
on
his
lips
he
blinked
and
tottered
under
it
as
it
passed
and
then
backed
humbly
to
his
divan
and
sat
down
gasping
a
little
and
patting
his
hand
on
his
heart
there
was
fright
written
all
over
his
whitened
face
we
we
forgot
that
i
am
a
sick
man
he
said
feebly
answering
look
of
surprised
inquiry
with
a
forced
wan
smile
i
was
afraid
my
heart
had
gone
she
scrutinized
him
for
a
further
moment
with
growing
reassurance
in
her
air
then
piling
up
the
pillows
and
cushions
behind
him
for
support
for
all
the
world
like
a
big
sister
again
she
stepped
into
the
inner
room
and
returned
with
a
flagon
of
quaint
shape
and
a
tiny
glass
she
poured
this
latter
full
to
the
brim
of
a
thick
yellowish
aromatic
liquid
and
gave
it
him
to
drink
this
benedictine
is
all
i
happen
to
have
she
said
swallow
it
down
it
will
do
you
theron
obeyed
her
it
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
but
upon
reflection
it
was
grateful
and
warming
he
did
feel
better
almost
immediately
a
great
wave
of
comfort
seemed
to
enfold
him
as
he
settled
himself
back
on
the
divan
for
that
one
flashing
instant
he
had
thought
that
he
was
dying
he
drew
a
long
grateful
breath
of
relief
and
smiled
his
content
celia
had
seated
herself
beside
him
a
little
away
she
sat
with
her
head
against
the
wall
and
one
foot
curled
under
her
and
almost
faced
him
i
dare
say
we
forced
the
pace
a
little
she
remarked
after
a
pause
looking
down
at
the
floor
with
the
puckers
of
a
ruminating
amusement
playing
in
the
corners
of
her
mouth
it
does
do
for
a
man
to
get
to
be
a
greek
all
of
a
sudden
he
must
work
along
up
to
it
he
remembered
the
music
oh
if
i
only
knew
how
to
tell
you
he
murmured
ecstatically
what
a
revelation
your
playing
has
been
to
me
i
had
never
imagined
anything
like
it
i
shall
think
of
it
to
my
dying
he
began
to
remember
as
well
the
spirit
that
was
in
the
air
when
the
music
ended
the
details
of
what
he
had
felt
and
said
rose
vaguely
in
his
mind
pondering
them
his
eye
roved
past
celia
figure
to
the
broad
open
doorway
beyond
the
curtains
behind
which
she
had
disappeared
were
again
parted
and
fastened
back
a
dim
light
was
burning
within
out
of
sight
and
its
faint
illumination
disclosed
a
room
filled
with
white
marbles
white
silks
white
draperies
of
varying
sorts
which
shaped
themselves
as
he
looked
into
the
canopy
and
trappings
of
an
extravagantly
and
sumptuous
bed
he
looked
away
again
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
you
really
mean
by
that
greek
idea
of
yours
he
said
with
the
abruptness
of
confusion
celia
did
not
display
much
enthusiasm
in
the
tone
of
her
answer
oh
she
said
almost
indifferently
lots
of
things
absolute
freedom
from
moral
bugbears
for
one
thing
the
recognition
that
beauty
is
the
only
thing
in
life
that
is
worth
while
the
courage
to
kick
out
of
one
life
everything
that
is
worth
while
and
so
but
said
theron
watching
the
mingled
delicacy
and
power
of
the
bared
arm
and
the
shapely
grace
of
the
hand
which
she
had
lifted
to
her
face
i
am
going
to
get
you
to
teach
it
all
to
the
memories
began
crowding
in
upon
him
now
and
the
baffling
note
upon
which
the
mazurka
had
stopped
short
chimed
like
a
in
his
ears
i
want
to
be
a
greek
myself
if
you
one
i
want
to
get
as
close
to
you
to
your
ideal
that
is
as
i
can
you
open
up
to
me
a
whole
world
that
i
had
not
even
dreamed
existed
we
swore
our
friendship
long
ago
you
know
and
now
after
tonight
you
and
the
music
have
decided
me
i
am
going
to
put
the
things
out
of
my
life
that
are
not
worthwhile
only
you
must
help
me
you
must
tell
me
how
to
he
looked
up
as
he
spoke
to
enforce
the
almost
tender
entreaty
of
his
words
the
spectacle
of
a
yawn
only
fractionally
concealed
behind
those
talented
fingers
chilled
his
soft
speech
and
sent
a
flush
over
his
face
he
rose
on
the
instant
celia
was
nothing
abashed
at
his
discovery
she
laughed
gayly
in
confession
of
her
fault
and
held
her
hand
out
to
let
him
help
her
disentangle
her
foot
from
her
draperies
and
get
off
the
divan
it
seemed
to
be
her
meaning
that
he
should
continue
holding
her
hand
after
she
was
also
standing
you
forgive
me
do
you
she
urged
smilingly
chopin
always
first
excites
me
then
sends
me
to
sleep
you
see
how
you
sleep
tonight
the
brown
velvety
eyes
rested
upon
him
from
under
their
heavy
lids
with
a
languorous
kindliness
her
warm
large
palm
clasped
his
in
frank
liking
i
do
want
to
sleep
at
all
ware
was
impelled
to
say
i
want
to
lie
awake
and
think
about
about
everything
all
over
she
smiled
drowsily
and
you
sure
you
feel
strong
enough
to
walk
home
yes
he
replied
with
a
lingering
dilatory
note
which
deepened
upon
reflection
into
a
sigh
oh
he
followed
her
and
her
candle
down
the
magnificent
stairway
again
she
blew
the
light
out
in
the
hall
and
opening
the
front
door
stood
with
him
for
a
silent
moment
on
the
threshold
then
they
shook
hands
once
more
and
with
a
whispered
parted
celia
returning
to
the
blue
and
yellow
room
lighted
a
cigarette
and
helped
herself
to
some
benedictine
in
the
glass
which
theron
had
used
she
looked
meditatively
at
this
little
glass
for
a
moment
turning
it
about
in
her
fingers
with
a
smile
the
smile
warmed
itself
suddenly
into
a
joyous
laugh
she
tossed
the
glass
aside
and
holding
out
her
flowing
skirts
with
both
hands
executed
a
swinging
pirouette
in
front
of
the
gravely
beautiful
statue
of
the
armless
woman
chapter
xx
it
was
apparent
to
the
rev
theron
ware
from
the
very
first
moment
of
waking
next
morning
that
both
he
and
the
world
had
changed
over
night
the
metamorphosis
in
the
harsh
toils
of
which
he
had
been
laboring
blindly
so
long
was
accomplished
he
stood
forth
so
to
speak
in
a
new
skin
and
looked
about
him
with
perceptions
of
quite
an
altered
kind
upon
what
seemed
in
every
way
a
fresh
existence
he
lacked
even
the
impulse
to
turn
round
and
inspect
the
cocoon
from
which
he
had
emerged
let
the
past
bury
the
past
he
had
no
vestige
of
interest
in
it
the
change
was
not
premature
he
found
himself
not
in
the
least
confused
by
it
or
frightened
before
he
had
finished
shaving
he
knew
himself
to
be
easily
and
comfortably
at
home
in
his
new
state
and
master
of
all
its
requirements
it
seemed
as
if
alice
too
recognized
that
he
had
become
another
man
when
he
went
down
and
took
his
chair
at
the
breakfast
table
they
had
exchanged
no
words
since
their
parting
in
the
the
previous
evening
an
event
now
faded
off
into
remote
vagueness
in
mind
he
smiled
brilliantly
in
answer
to
the
furtive
glance
she
stole
at
him
as
she
brought
the
dishes
in
ah
potatoes
warmed
up
in
cream
he
said
with
hearty
pleasure
in
his
tone
what
a
you
are
to
be
sure
i
glad
you
feeling
so
much
better
she
said
briefly
taking
her
seat
better
he
returned
i
a
new
being
she
ventured
to
look
him
over
more
freely
upon
this
assurance
he
perceived
and
catalogued
one
by
one
the
emotions
which
the
small
brain
was
expressing
through
those
shallow
blue
eyes
of
hers
she
was
turning
over
this
that
and
the
other
hostile
thought
and
childish
grievance
most
of
all
she
was
dallying
with
the
idea
of
asking
him
where
he
had
been
till
after
midnight
he
smiled
affably
in
the
face
of
this
scattering
fire
of
peevish
glances
and
did
not
dream
of
resenting
any
phase
of
them
all
i
am
going
down
to
thurston
this
morning
and
order
that
piano
sent
up
today
he
announced
presently
in
a
casual
way
why
theron
can
we
afford
it
the
wife
asked
regarding
him
with
surprise
oh
easily
enough
he
replied
you
know
increased
my
she
shook
her
head
no
i
did
how
should
i
you
do
realize
it
she
went
on
dolefully
but
you
getting
so
you
do
tell
me
the
least
thing
about
your
affairs
theron
laughed
aloud
you
ought
to
be
grateful
such
melancholy
affairs
as
mine
have
been
till
now
he
declared
that
is
if
it
were
absurd
to
think
such
a
then
more
soberly
he
explained
no
my
girl
it
is
you
who
do
realize
i
am
carrying
big
projects
in
my
mind
big
ambitious
thoughts
and
plans
upon
which
great
things
depend
they
no
doubt
make
me
seem
preoccupied
and
but
it
is
a
part
to
understand
and
make
allowances
and
not
intrude
trifles
which
may
throw
everything
out
of
gear
do
think
i
scolding
my
girl
i
only
speak
to
reassure
you
and
and
help
you
to
comprehend
of
course
i
know
that
you
would
willingly
embarrass
my
my
of
course
not
responded
alice
dubiously
but
but
but
what
theron
felt
compelled
by
civility
to
say
though
on
the
instant
he
reproached
himself
for
the
weakness
of
it
well
i
hardly
know
how
to
say
it
she
faltered
but
it
was
nicer
in
the
old
days
before
you
bothered
your
head
about
big
projects
and
your
career
as
you
call
it
and
were
just
a
good
earnest
simple
young
servant
of
the
lord
oh
theron
she
broke
forth
suddenly
with
tearful
zeal
i
get
sometimes
lately
almost
scared
lest
you
should
turn
out
to
be
a
a
backslider
the
husband
sat
upright
and
hardened
his
countenance
but
yesterday
the
word
would
have
had
in
it
all
sorts
of
inherited
terrors
for
him
this
morning
dawn
of
a
new
existence
revealed
it
as
merely
an
empty
and
stupid
epithet
these
are
things
not
to
be
said
he
admonished
her
after
a
pause
and
speaking
with
carefully
measured
austerity
least
of
all
are
they
to
be
said
to
a
clergyman
by
his
it
was
on
the
tip
of
alice
tongue
to
retort
better
by
his
wife
than
by
outsiders
but
she
bit
her
lips
and
kept
the
gibe
back
a
rebuke
of
this
form
and
gravity
was
a
novelty
in
their
relations
the
fear
that
it
had
been
merited
troubled
even
while
it
did
not
convince
her
mind
and
the
puzzled
apprehension
was
to
be
read
plainly
enough
on
her
face
theron
noting
it
saw
a
good
deal
more
behind
really
it
was
amazing
how
much
wiser
he
had
grown
all
at
once
he
had
been
married
for
years
and
it
was
only
this
morning
that
he
suddenly
discovered
how
a
wife
ought
to
be
handled
he
continued
to
look
sternly
away
into
space
for
a
little
then
his
brows
relaxed
slowly
and
under
the
visible
influence
of
melting
considerations
he
nodded
his
head
turned
toward
her
abruptly
and
broke
the
silence
with
labored
amiability
come
come
the
day
began
so
pleasantly
it
was
so
good
to
feel
well
again
let
us
talk
about
the
piano
instead
that
is
he
added
with
an
obvious
overture
to
playfulness
if
the
thought
of
having
a
piano
is
not
too
distasteful
to
alice
yielded
almost
effusively
to
his
altered
mood
they
went
together
into
the
to
measure
and
decide
between
the
two
available
spaces
which
were
at
their
disposal
and
he
insisted
with
resolute
magnanimity
on
her
settling
this
question
entirely
by
herself
when
at
last
he
mentioned
the
fact
that
it
was
friday
and
he
would
look
over
some
sermon
memoranda
before
he
went
out
alice
retired
to
the
kitchen
in
openly
cheerful
spirits
theron
spread
some
old
manuscript
sermons
before
him
on
his
desk
and
took
down
his
as
well
but
there
his
application
flagged
and
he
surrendered
himself
instead
chin
on
hand
to
staring
out
at
the
rhododendron
in
the
yard
he
recalled
how
he
had
seen
soulsby
patiently
studying
this
identical
bush
the
notion
of
soulsby
not
knowing
at
all
how
to
sing
yet
diligently
learning
those
sixths
brought
a
smile
to
his
mind
and
then
he
seemed
to
hear
celia
calling
out
over
her
shoulder
that
what
chopin
does
he
sings
the
spirit
of
that
wonderful
music
came
back
to
him
enfolded
him
in
its
wings
it
seemed
to
raise
itself
up
a
palpable
barrier
between
him
and
all
that
he
had
known
and
felt
and
done
before
that
was
his
new
birth
that
marvellous
night
with
the
piano
the
conceit
pleased
him
not
the
less
because
there
flashed
along
with
it
the
thought
that
it
was
a
poet
that
had
been
born
yes
the
former
country
lout
the
narrow
zealot
the
untutored
slave
groping
about
in
the
dark
after
silly
superstitions
cringing
at
the
scowl
of
mean
pierces
and
winches
was
dead
there
was
an
end
of
him
and
good
riddance
in
his
place
there
had
been
born
a
poet
he
spelled
the
word
out
now
unabashed
a
child
of
light
a
lover
of
beauty
and
sweet
sounds
a
recognizable
brother
to
renan
and
chopin
and
celia
out
of
the
soothing
tenderly
grateful
revery
a
practical
suggestion
suddenly
took
shape
he
acted
upon
it
without
a
moment
delay
getting
out
his
and
writing
hurriedly
dear
miss
madden
life
will
be
more
tolerable
to
me
if
before
nightfall
i
can
know
that
there
is
a
piano
under
my
roof
even
if
it
remains
dumb
it
will
be
some
comfort
to
have
it
here
and
look
at
it
and
imagine
how
a
great
master
might
make
it
speak
would
it
be
too
much
to
beg
you
to
look
in
at
thurston
say
at
eleven
this
forenoon
and
give
me
the
inestimable
benefit
of
your
judgment
in
selecting
an
instrument
do
not
trouble
to
answer
this
for
i
am
leaving
home
now
but
shall
call
at
thurston
at
eleven
and
wait
thanking
you
in
anticipation
i
am
here
theron
fluency
came
to
a
sharp
halt
there
were
adverbs
enough
and
to
spare
on
the
point
of
his
pen
but
the
right
one
was
not
easy
to
come
at
gratefully
faithfully
sincerely
truly
each
in
turn
struck
a
false
note
he
felt
himself
not
quite
any
of
these
things
at
last
he
decided
to
write
just
the
simple
word
yours
and
then
wavered
between
satisfaction
at
his
boldness
dread
lest
he
had
been
and
worst
of
the
lot
fear
that
she
would
not
notice
it
one
way
or
the
other
all
the
while
he
sealed
and
addressed
the
letter
put
it
carefully
in
an
inner
pocket
and
got
his
hat
there
was
a
moment
hesitation
as
to
notifying
the
kitchen
of
his
departure
the
interests
of
domestic
discipline
seemed
to
point
the
other
way
he
walked
softly
through
the
hall
and
let
himself
out
by
the
front
door
without
a
sound
down
by
the
canal
bridge
he
picked
out
an
idle
boy
to
his
mind
a
lad
whose
aspect
appeared
to
promise
intelligence
as
a
messenger
combined
with
large
impartiality
in
sectarian
matters
he
was
to
have
ten
cents
on
his
return
and
he
might
report
himself
to
his
patron
at
the
bookstore
yonder
theron
was
grateful
to
the
old
bookseller
for
remaining
at
his
desk
in
the
rear
there
was
a
tacit
compliment
in
the
suggestion
that
he
was
not
a
mere
customer
demanding
instant
attention
besides
there
was
no
keeping
thurston
out
of
conversations
in
this
place
loitering
along
the
shelves
the
young
minister
eye
suddenly
found
itself
arrested
by
a
name
on
a
cover
there
were
a
dozen
narrow
volumes
in
uniform
binding
huddled
together
under
a
cardboard
label
of
eminent
women
oddly
enough
one
of
these
bore
the
title
george
theron
saw
there
must
be
some
mistake
as
he
took
the
book
down
and
opened
it
his
glance
hit
by
accident
upon
the
name
of
chopin
then
he
read
attentively
until
almost
the
stroke
of
eleven
we
have
to
make
ourselves
acquainted
with
all
sorts
of
queer
phases
of
life
he
explained
in
to
the
old
bookseller
then
counting
out
the
money
for
the
book
from
his
lean
purse
he
smiled
as
he
added
there
seems
something
almost
wrong
about
taking
advantage
of
the
clergyman
discount
for
a
life
of
george
i
do
know
answered
the
other
pleasantly
guess
she
so
much
different
from
the
rest
of
except
that
she
did
mind
appearances
we
know
about
her
we
do
know
about
the
i
must
hurry
said
theron
turning
on
his
heel
the
haste
with
which
he
strode
out
of
the
store
crossed
the
street
and
made
his
way
toward
thurston
did
not
prevent
his
thinking
much
upon
the
astonishing
things
he
had
encountered
in
this
book
their
relation
to
celia
forced
itself
more
and
more
upon
his
mind
he
could
recall
the
twinkle
in
her
eye
the
in
her
tone
as
she
commented
with
that
yes
george
something
upon
his
blundering
ignorance
his
mortification
at
having
thus
exposed
his
dull
rusticity
was
swallowed
up
in
conjectures
as
to
just
what
her
tolerant
familiarity
with
such
things
involved
he
had
never
before
met
a
young
unmarried
woman
who
would
have
confessed
to
him
any
such
knowledge
but
then
of
course
he
had
never
known
a
girl
who
resembled
celia
in
any
other
way
he
recognized
vaguely
that
he
must
provide
himself
with
an
entire
new
set
of
standards
by
which
to
measure
and
comprehend
her
but
it
was
for
the
moment
more
interesting
to
wonder
what
her
standards
were
did
she
object
to
george
sand
behavior
or
did
she
sympathize
with
that
sort
of
thing
did
those
statues
and
the
diaphonous
toga
and
unbound
hair
the
cigarettes
the
fiery
liqueur
the
deliberately
sensuous
music
was
he
to
believe
that
they
signified
ware
you
have
managed
by
a
miracle
to
hit
on
one
of
my
punctual
days
said
celia
she
was
standing
on
the
doorstep
at
the
entrance
to
the
musical
department
of
thurston
he
had
not
noticed
before
the
fact
that
the
sun
was
shining
the
full
glare
of
its
strong
light
enveloping
her
figure
as
she
stood
and
drawing
the
dazzled
eye
for
relief
to
the
bower
of
softened
color
close
beneath
her
parasol
of
creamy
silk
and
lace
was
what
struck
him
now
first
of
all
it
was
as
if
celia
had
brought
the
sun
with
her
theron
shook
hands
with
her
and
found
joy
in
the
perception
that
his
own
hand
trembled
he
put
boldly
into
words
the
thought
that
came
to
him
it
was
generous
of
you
he
said
to
wait
for
me
out
here
where
all
might
delight
in
the
sight
of
you
instead
of
squandering
the
privilege
on
a
handful
of
clerks
miss
madden
beamed
upon
him
and
nodded
approval
alcibiades
never
turned
a
prettier
compliment
she
remarked
they
went
in
together
at
this
and
theron
made
a
note
of
the
name
during
the
ensuing
the
young
minister
followed
about
even
more
humbly
than
the
clerks
in
celia
commanding
wake
there
were
a
good
many
pianos
in
the
big
overhead
and
theron
found
himself
almost
awed
by
their
size
and
brilliancy
of
polish
and
the
thought
of
the
tremendous
sum
of
money
they
represented
altogether
not
so
with
the
organist
she
ordered
them
rolled
around
this
way
or
that
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
checkers
on
a
she
threw
back
their
covers
with
the
scant
ceremony
of
a
dispensary
dentist
opening
mouths
she
exploited
their
several
capacities
with
masterful
hands
not
deigning
to
seat
herself
but
just
slightly
bending
forward
and
sweeping
her
fingers
up
and
down
their
keyboards
able
domineering
fingers
which
pounded
tinkled
meditated
assented
condemned
all
in
a
flash
and
amid
what
affected
the
layman
ears
as
a
hopelessly
discordant
hubbub
theron
moved
about
in
the
group
nursing
her
parasol
in
his
arms
and
watching
her
the
exaggerated
deference
which
the
clerks
and
salesmen
showed
to
her
as
the
rich
miss
madden
seemed
to
him
to
be
mixed
with
a
certain
assertion
of
the
claims
of
on
the
score
of
her
being
a
musician
there
undoubtedly
was
a
sense
of
freemasonry
between
them
they
alluded
continually
in
technical
terms
to
matters
of
which
he
knew
nothing
and
were
amused
at
remarks
of
hers
which
to
him
carried
no
meaning
whatever
it
was
evident
that
the
young
men
liked
her
and
that
their
liking
pleased
her
it
thrilled
him
to
think
that
she
knew
he
liked
her
too
and
to
recall
what
abundant
proofs
she
had
given
that
here
also
she
had
pleasure
in
the
fact
he
clung
insistently
to
the
memory
of
these
evidences
they
helped
him
to
resist
a
disagreeable
tendency
to
feel
himself
an
intruder
an
outsider
among
these
pianoforte
experts
when
it
was
all
over
celia
waved
the
others
aside
and
talked
with
theron
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
she
said
there
nothing
here
really
good
it
is
always
much
better
to
buy
of
the
makers
do
they
sell
on
the
instalment
plan
he
asked
there
was
a
wistful
effect
in
his
voice
which
caught
her
attention
she
looked
away
out
through
the
window
on
the
street
below
for
a
moment
then
her
eyes
returned
to
his
and
regarded
him
with
a
comforting
friendly
glance
recalling
for
all
the
world
the
way
sister
soulsby
had
looked
at
him
at
odd
times
oh
you
want
it
at
once
i
see
she
remarked
softly
well
this
adelberger
is
the
best
value
for
the
ware
followed
her
finger
and
beheld
with
dismay
that
it
pointed
toward
the
largest
instrument
in
the
room
a
veritable
leviathan
among
pianos
the
price
of
this
had
been
mentioned
as
he
turned
over
the
fact
that
this
was
his
yearly
salary
and
found
the
courage
to
shake
his
head
it
would
be
too
large
much
too
large
for
the
room
he
explained
and
besides
it
is
more
than
i
like
to
pay
or
can
pay
for
that
it
was
pitiful
to
be
explaining
such
details
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
they
picked
out
a
smaller
one
which
celia
said
was
at
least
of
fair
quality
now
leave
all
the
bargaining
to
me
she
adjured
him
these
prices
that
they
talk
about
in
the
piano
trade
are
all
in
the
air
there
are
tremendous
discounts
if
one
knows
how
to
insist
upon
them
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
tell
them
to
send
it
to
your
house
you
wanted
it
today
you
said
yes
in
memory
of
yesterday
he
murmured
she
herself
gave
the
directions
and
thurston
people
now
all
salesmen
again
bowed
grateful
acquiescence
then
she
sailed
regally
across
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
drawing
theron
in
her
train
the
hirelings
made
salaams
to
him
as
well
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
interpose
anything
so
trivial
and
squalid
as
talk
about
terms
and
dates
of
payment
i
am
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
he
said
fervently
in
the
comparative
solitude
of
the
lower
floor
she
had
paused
to
look
at
something
in
the
of
course
i
was
entirely
at
your
service
do
mention
it
she
replied
reaching
forth
her
hand
in
an
absent
way
for
her
parasol
he
held
up
instead
the
volume
he
had
purchased
guess
what
that
is
you
never
would
guess
in
this
wide
world
his
manner
was
surcharged
with
a
sense
of
the
surreptitious
well
then
there
no
good
trying
is
there
commented
celia
her
glance
roving
again
toward
the
shelves
it
is
a
life
of
george
sand
whispered
theron
i
been
reading
it
this
morning
all
the
chopin
part
while
i
was
waiting
for
to
his
surprise
there
was
an
apparently
displeased
contraction
of
her
brows
as
he
made
this
revelation
for
the
instant
a
dreadful
fear
of
having
offended
her
seized
upon
and
sickened
him
but
then
her
face
cleared
as
by
magic
she
smiled
and
let
her
eyes
twinkle
in
laughter
at
him
and
lifted
a
forefinger
in
the
most
winning
mockery
of
admonition
naughty
naughty
she
murmured
back
with
a
roguishly
solemn
wink
he
had
no
response
ready
for
this
but
mutely
handed
her
the
parasol
the
situation
had
suddenly
grown
too
confused
for
words
or
even
sequent
thoughts
uppermost
across
the
of
his
mind
there
scudded
the
singular
reflection
that
he
should
never
hear
her
play
on
that
new
piano
of
his
even
as
it
flashed
by
out
of
sight
he
recognized
it
for
one
of
the
griefs
of
his
life
and
the
darkness
which
followed
seemed
nothing
but
a
revolt
against
the
idea
of
having
a
piano
at
all
he
would
countermand
the
order
he
would
but
she
was
speaking
again
they
had
strolled
toward
the
door
and
her
voice
was
as
placidly
conventional
as
if
the
talk
had
never
strayed
from
the
subject
of
pianos
theron
with
an
effort
pulled
himself
together
and
laid
hold
of
her
words
i
suppose
you
will
be
going
the
other
way
she
was
saying
i
shall
have
to
be
at
the
church
all
day
we
have
just
got
a
new
mass
over
from
vienna
and
i
head
over
heels
in
work
at
it
i
can
have
father
forbes
to
myself
today
too
that
bear
of
a
doctor
has
got
the
rheumatism
and
ca
come
out
of
his
cave
thank
heaven
and
then
she
was
receding
from
view
up
the
sunlit
busy
sidewalk
and
theron
standing
on
the
doorstep
ruefully
rubbed
his
chin
she
had
said
he
was
going
the
other
way
and
after
a
little
pause
he
made
her
words
good
though
each
step
he
took
seemed
all
in
despite
of
his
personal
inclinations
some
of
the
bowed
to
him
and
one
or
two
paused
as
if
to
shake
hands
and
exchange
greetings
he
nodded
responses
mechanically
but
did
not
stop
it
was
as
if
he
feared
to
interrupt
the
process
of
lifting
his
reluctant
feet
and
propelling
them
forward
lest
they
should
wheel
and
scuttle
off
in
the
opposite
direction
chapter
xxi
deliberate
as
his
progress
was
the
diminishing
number
of
along
the
sidewalk
and
the
increasing
proportion
of
enclosing
domestic
lawns
forced
upon
theron
attention
the
fact
that
he
was
nearing
home
it
was
a
trifle
past
the
hour
for
his
midday
meal
he
was
not
in
the
least
hungry
still
less
did
he
feel
any
desire
just
now
to
sit
about
in
that
library
of
his
why
should
he
go
home
at
all
there
was
no
reason
whatever
save
that
alice
would
be
expecting
him
upon
reflection
that
hardly
amounted
to
a
reason
wives
with
their
limited
grasp
of
the
realities
of
life
were
always
expecting
their
husbands
to
do
things
which
it
turned
out
not
to
be
feasible
for
them
to
do
the
customary
male
animal
spent
a
considerable
part
of
his
life
in
explaining
to
his
mate
why
it
had
been
necessary
to
disappoint
or
upset
her
little
plans
for
his
comings
and
goings
it
was
in
the
very
nature
of
things
that
it
should
be
so
sustained
by
these
considerations
ware
slackened
his
steps
then
halted
irresolutely
and
after
a
minute
hesitation
entered
the
small
temperance
restaurant
before
which
as
by
intuition
he
had
paused
the
elderly
woman
who
placed
on
the
tiny
table
before
him
the
tea
and
rolls
he
ordered
was
entirely
unknown
to
him
he
felt
sure
yet
none
the
less
she
smiled
at
him
and
spoke
almost
familiarly
i
suppose
ware
is
at
the
seaside
and
you
are
keeping
bachelor
hall
not
quite
that
he
responded
stiffly
and
hurried
through
the
meagre
and
distasteful
repast
to
avoid
any
further
conversation
there
was
an
idea
underlying
her
remark
however
which
recurred
to
him
when
he
had
paid
his
ten
cents
and
got
out
on
the
street
again
there
was
something
interesting
in
the
thought
of
alice
at
the
seaside
neither
of
them
had
ever
laid
eyes
on
salt
water
but
theron
took
for
granted
the
most
extravagant
landsman
conception
of
its
curative
and
invigorating
powers
it
was
apparent
to
him
that
he
was
going
to
pay
much
greater
attention
to
alice
happiness
and
in
the
future
than
he
had
latterly
done
he
had
bought
her
this
very
day
a
superb
new
piano
he
was
going
to
simply
insist
on
her
having
a
hired
girl
and
this
seaside
notion
why
that
was
best
of
all
his
fancy
built
up
pleasant
visions
of
her
feasting
her
delighted
eyes
upon
the
marvel
of
a
great
ocean
storm
or
roaming
along
a
beach
strewn
with
wonderful
marine
shells
exhibiting
an
innocent
joy
in
their
beauty
the
fresh
blew
through
her
hair
as
he
saw
her
in
mind
eye
and
brought
the
hardy
flush
of
health
back
upon
her
rather
pallid
cheeks
he
was
prepared
already
hardly
to
know
her
so
robust
and
revivified
would
she
have
become
by
the
time
he
went
down
to
the
depot
to
meet
her
on
her
return
for
his
imagination
stopped
short
of
seeing
himself
at
the
seaside
it
sketched
instead
pictures
of
whole
weeks
of
solitary
academic
calm
alone
with
his
books
and
his
thoughts
the
facts
that
he
had
no
books
and
that
nobody
dreamed
of
interfering
with
his
thoughts
subordinated
themselves
humbly
to
his
mood
the
prospect
as
he
mused
fondly
upon
it
expanded
to
embrace
the
priest
and
the
doctor
libraries
the
thoughts
which
he
longed
to
be
alone
with
involved
close
communion
with
their
thoughts
it
could
not
but
prove
a
season
of
immense
mental
stimulation
and
ethical
broadening
it
would
have
its
lofty
poetic
and
artistic
side
as
well
the
languorous
melodies
of
chopin
stole
over
his
revery
as
he
dwelt
upon
these
things
and
soft
azure
and
golden
lights
modelled
forth
the
exquisite
outlines
of
tall
marble
forms
he
opened
the
gate
leading
to
ledsmar
house
his
walk
had
brought
him
quite
out
of
the
town
and
up
by
a
broad
main
highway
which
yet
took
on
all
sorts
of
sylvan
charms
to
a
commanding
site
on
the
hillside
below
in
the
valley
lay
octavius
at
one
end
in
factory
smoke
at
the
other
where
narrow
bands
of
water
gleamed
upon
the
surface
of
a
broad
plain
piled
symmetrically
with
lumber
presenting
an
oddly
incongruous
suggestion
of
forest
odors
and
the
simplicity
of
the
wilderness
in
the
middle
distance
on
gradually
rising
ground
stretched
a
wide
belt
of
dense
artificial
foliage
peeping
through
which
tiled
turrets
and
ornamented
chimneys
marked
the
polite
residences
of
those
who
though
they
neither
stoked
the
furnace
fires
to
the
west
nor
sawed
the
lumber
on
the
east
lived
in
purple
and
fine
linen
from
the
profits
of
this
toil
nearer
at
hand
pastures
with
grazing
cows
on
the
one
side
of
the
road
and
the
nigh
board
fence
of
the
on
the
other
completed
the
jumble
of
primitive
rusticity
and
urban
complications
characterizing
the
whole
picture
ledsmar
house
toward
which
theron
impulses
had
been
secretly
leading
him
ever
since
celia
parting
remark
about
the
rheumatism
was
of
that
spacious
and
satisfying
order
of
houses
which
men
of
leisure
and
means
built
for
themselves
while
the
early
traditions
of
a
sparse
and
contented
homogeneous
population
were
still
strong
in
the
republic
there
was
a
hospitable
look
about
its
wide
veranda
its
broad
low
bulk
and
its
big
double
front
door
which
did
not
fit
at
all
with
the
sketch
of
a
recluse
that
the
doctor
had
drawn
of
himself
theron
had
prepared
his
mind
for
the
effect
of
being
admitted
by
a
chinaman
and
was
taken
somewhat
aback
when
the
door
was
opened
by
the
doctor
himself
his
reception
was
pleasant
enough
almost
cordial
but
the
sense
of
awkwardness
followed
him
into
his
host
inner
room
and
rested
heavily
upon
his
opening
speech
i
heard
quite
by
accident
that
you
were
ill
he
said
laying
aside
his
hat
it
nothing
at
all
replied
ledsmar
merely
a
stiff
shoulder
that
i
wear
from
time
to
time
in
memory
of
my
father
it
ought
to
be
quite
gone
by
nightfall
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
all
the
same
sit
down
if
you
can
find
a
chair
as
usual
we
are
littered
up
to
our
eyes
here
it
throw
those
things
on
the
ware
carefully
deposited
an
armful
of
pamphlets
on
the
rug
at
his
feet
and
sat
down
litter
was
indeed
the
word
for
what
he
saw
about
him
bookcases
chairs
tables
the
corners
of
the
floor
were
all
buried
deep
under
disorderly
strata
of
papers
diagrams
and
opened
books
one
could
hardly
walk
about
without
treading
on
them
the
dust
which
danced
up
into
the
bar
of
sunshine
streaming
in
from
the
window
as
the
doctor
stepped
across
to
another
chair
gave
theron
new
ideas
about
the
value
of
chinese
servants
i
must
thank
you
first
of
all
doctor
he
began
for
your
kindness
in
coming
when
i
was
was
sick
and
ye
visited
me
you
must
think
of
it
that
way
said
ledsmar
your
friend
came
for
me
and
of
course
i
went
and
gladly
too
there
was
nothing
that
i
could
do
or
that
anybody
could
do
very
interesting
man
that
friend
of
yours
and
his
wife
too
both
quite
out
of
the
common
i
do
know
when
i
seen
two
such
really
genuine
people
i
should
like
to
have
known
more
of
them
are
they
still
here
they
went
yesterday
theron
replied
his
earlier
shyness
had
worn
off
and
he
felt
comfortably
at
his
ease
i
do
know
he
went
on
that
the
word
is
just
what
would
have
occurred
to
me
to
describe
the
soulsbys
they
are
very
interesting
people
as
you
say
most
interesting
and
there
was
a
time
i
dare
say
when
i
should
have
believed
in
their
sincerity
but
of
course
i
saw
them
and
their
performance
from
the
inside
like
one
on
the
stage
of
a
theatre
you
know
instead
of
in
the
audience
and
well
i
understand
things
better
than
i
used
the
doctor
looked
over
his
spectacles
at
him
with
a
suggestion
of
inquiry
in
his
glance
and
theron
continued
i
had
several
long
talks
with
her
she
told
me
very
frankly
the
whole
story
of
her
life
and
and
it
was
decidedly
queer
i
can
assure
you
i
may
say
to
you
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
that
since
my
talk
with
you
and
the
books
you
lent
me
i
see
many
things
differently
indeed
when
i
think
upon
it
sometimes
my
old
state
of
mind
seems
quite
incredible
to
me
i
can
use
no
word
for
my
new
state
short
of
ledsmar
continued
to
regard
his
guest
with
that
calm
interrogatory
scrutiny
of
his
he
did
not
seem
disposed
to
take
up
the
great
issue
of
illumination
i
suppose
he
said
after
a
little
no
woman
can
come
in
contact
with
a
priest
for
any
length
of
time
without
telling
him
the
of
her
life
as
you
call
it
they
all
do
it
the
thing
amounts
to
a
the
young
minister
veins
responded
with
a
pleasurable
thrill
to
the
use
of
the
word
priest
in
obvious
allusion
to
himself
perhaps
in
fairness
i
ought
to
explain
he
said
that
in
her
case
it
was
only
done
in
the
course
of
a
long
talk
about
myself
i
might
say
that
it
was
by
way
of
kindly
warning
to
me
she
saw
how
i
had
become
unsettled
in
many
many
of
my
former
views
and
she
was
nervous
lest
this
should
lead
me
to
to
to
throw
up
the
priesthood
the
doctor
interposed
upon
his
hesitation
yes
i
know
the
tribe
why
my
dear
sir
your
entire
profession
would
have
perished
from
the
memory
of
mankind
if
it
had
been
for
women
it
is
a
very
curious
subject
lots
of
thinkers
have
dipped
into
it
but
no
one
has
gone
resolutely
in
with
a
and
exploited
the
whole
thing
our
boys
for
instance
traverse
in
their
younger
years
all
the
stages
of
the
childhood
of
the
race
they
have
terrifying
dreams
of
awful
monsters
and
giant
animals
of
which
they
have
never
so
much
as
heard
in
their
waking
hours
they
pass
through
the
lust
for
digging
caves
building
fires
sleeping
out
in
the
woods
hunting
with
bows
and
arrows
all
remote
ancestral
impulses
they
play
games
with
stones
marbles
and
so
on
at
regular
stated
periods
of
the
year
which
they
instinctively
know
just
as
they
were
played
in
the
bronze
age
and
heaven
only
knows
how
much
earlier
but
the
boy
goes
through
all
this
and
leaves
it
behind
him
so
completely
that
the
grown
man
feels
himself
more
a
stranger
among
boys
of
his
own
place
who
are
thinking
and
doing
precisely
the
things
he
thought
and
did
a
few
years
before
than
he
would
among
kurds
or
esquimaux
but
the
woman
is
totally
different
she
is
infinitely
more
precocious
as
a
girl
at
an
age
when
her
slow
brother
is
still
stubbing
along
somewhere
in
the
neolithic
period
she
has
flown
way
ahead
to
a
kind
of
mediaeval
stage
or
dawn
of
mediaevalism
which
is
peculiarly
her
own
having
got
there
she
stays
there
she
dies
there
the
boy
passes
her
as
the
tortoise
did
the
hare
he
goes
on
if
he
is
a
philosopher
and
lets
her
remain
in
the
dark
ages
where
she
belongs
if
he
happens
to
be
a
fool
which
is
customary
he
stops
and
hangs
around
in
her
theron
smiled
we
priests
he
said
and
paused
again
to
enjoy
the
words
i
suppose
i
ought
to
inquire
too
closely
just
where
we
belong
in
the
we
are
considering
the
question
impersonally
said
the
doctor
first
of
all
what
you
regard
as
religion
is
especially
calculated
to
attract
women
they
remain
as
superstitious
today
down
in
the
marrow
of
their
bones
as
they
were
ten
thousand
years
ago
even
the
cleverest
of
them
are
secretly
afraid
of
omens
and
respect
auguries
think
of
the
broadest
women
you
know
one
of
them
will
throw
salt
over
her
shoulder
if
she
spills
it
another
drinks
money
from
her
cup
by
skimming
the
bubbles
in
a
spoon
another
forecasts
her
future
by
the
arrangement
of
they
make
the
constituency
to
which
an
institution
based
on
mysteries
miracles
and
the
supernatural
generally
would
naturally
appeal
secondly
there
is
the
personality
of
the
yes
assented
ware
there
rose
up
before
him
on
the
instant
the
graceful
portly
figure
and
strong
comely
face
of
father
forbes
women
are
not
a
metaphysical
people
they
do
not
easily
follow
abstractions
they
want
their
dogmas
and
religious
sentiments
embodied
in
a
man
just
as
they
do
their
romantic
fancies
of
course
you
protestants
with
your
married
clergy
see
less
of
the
effects
of
this
than
celibates
do
but
even
with
you
there
is
a
great
deal
in
it
why
the
very
institution
of
celibacy
itself
was
forced
upon
the
early
christian
church
by
the
scandal
of
rich
roman
ladies
loading
bishops
and
handsome
priests
with
fabulous
gifts
until
the
passion
for
currying
favor
with
women
of
wealth
and
marrying
them
or
wheedling
their
fortunes
from
them
debauched
the
whole
priesthood
you
should
read
your
i
will
certainly
said
the
listener
resolving
to
remember
the
name
and
refer
it
to
the
old
bookseller
well
whatever
laws
one
sect
or
another
makes
the
woman
attitude
toward
the
priest
survives
she
desires
to
see
him
surrounded
by
and
candles
to
have
him
smelling
of
musk
she
would
like
to
curl
his
hair
and
weave
garlands
in
it
although
she
is
not
learned
enough
to
have
ever
heard
of
such
things
she
intuitively
feels
in
his
presence
a
sort
of
backwash
of
the
old
pagan
sensuality
and
lascivious
mysticism
which
enveloped
the
priesthood
in
greek
and
roman
days
ugh
it
makes
one
sick
ledsmar
rose
as
he
spoke
and
dismissed
the
topic
with
a
dry
little
laugh
come
let
me
show
you
round
a
bit
he
said
my
shoulder
is
easier
walking
than
have
you
never
written
a
book
yourself
asked
theron
getting
to
his
feet
i
have
a
thing
on
the
scientist
replied
written
years
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
should
enjoy
reading
it
urged
the
other
the
doctor
laughed
again
you
have
to
learn
german
then
i
afraid
it
is
still
in
circulation
in
germany
i
believe
on
its
merits
as
a
serious
book
i
have
a
copy
of
the
edition
in
english
that
was
all
exhausted
by
collectors
who
bought
it
for
its
supposed
obscenity
like
burton
nights
come
this
way
and
i
will
show
you
my
they
moved
out
of
the
room
and
through
a
passage
ledsmar
talking
as
he
led
the
way
i
took
up
that
subject
when
i
was
at
college
by
a
curious
chance
i
kept
a
young
monkey
in
my
rooms
which
had
been
born
in
captivity
i
brought
home
from
a
beer
hall
it
was
in
germany
some
pretzels
one
night
and
tossed
one
toward
the
monkey
he
jumped
toward
it
then
screamed
and
ran
back
shuddering
with
fright
i
understand
it
at
first
then
i
saw
that
the
curled
pretzel
lying
there
on
the
floor
was
very
like
a
little
snake
the
monkey
had
never
seen
a
snake
but
it
was
in
his
blood
to
be
afraid
of
one
that
incident
changed
my
whole
life
for
me
up
to
that
evening
i
had
intended
to
be
a
theron
did
not
feel
sure
that
he
had
understood
the
point
of
the
anecdote
he
looked
now
without
much
interest
at
some
dark
little
tanks
containing
thick
water
a
row
of
small
glass
cases
with
adders
and
other
lesser
reptiles
inside
and
a
general
collection
of
boxes
jars
and
similar
receptacles
connected
with
the
doctor
pursuits
further
on
was
a
smaller
chamber
with
a
big
empty
furnace
and
shelves
bearing
bottles
and
apparatus
like
a
drugstore
it
was
pleasanter
in
the
conservatory
a
low
spacious
structure
with
broad
pathways
between
the
plants
and
an
awning
over
the
sunny
side
of
the
roof
the
plants
were
mostly
orchids
he
learned
he
had
read
of
them
but
never
seen
any
before
no
doubt
they
were
curious
but
he
discovered
nothing
to
justify
the
great
fuss
made
about
them
the
heat
grew
oppressive
inside
and
he
was
glad
to
emerge
into
the
garden
he
paused
under
the
grateful
shade
of
a
trellis
took
off
his
hat
and
looked
about
him
with
a
sigh
of
relief
everything
seemed
and
natural
and
delightfully
free
from
pretence
in
the
big
overgrown
field
of
flowers
and
shrubs
theron
recalled
with
some
surprise
celia
indictment
of
the
doctor
as
a
man
with
no
poetry
in
his
soul
you
must
be
extremely
fond
of
flowers
he
remarked
ledsmar
shrugged
his
well
shoulder
they
have
their
points
he
said
briefly
these
are
all
dioecious
here
over
beyond
are
monoecious
species
my
work
is
to
test
the
probabilities
for
or
against
theory
that
hermaphroditism
in
plants
is
a
late
of
these
earlier
and
is
his
theory
right
asked
ware
with
a
polite
show
of
interest
we
may
know
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
hundred
years
replied
ledsmar
he
looked
up
into
his
guest
face
with
a
quizzical
that
is
a
very
brief
period
for
observation
when
such
a
complicated
question
as
sex
is
involved
he
added
we
have
been
studying
the
female
of
our
own
species
for
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
and
we
have
arrived
at
the
most
elementary
rules
governing
her
they
had
moved
along
to
a
bed
of
tall
plants
the
more
forward
of
which
were
beginning
to
show
bloom
here
another
task
will
begin
next
month
the
doctor
observed
these
are
salvias
pentstemons
and
antirrhinums
or
snapdragons
planted
very
thick
for
the
purpose
bore
holes
through
their
base
to
save
the
labor
of
climbing
in
and
out
of
the
flowers
and
we
do
quite
know
yet
why
some
discover
and
utilize
these
holes
at
once
while
others
never
do
it
may
be
merely
the
conservatism
of
the
individual
or
there
may
be
a
law
in
these
seemed
very
paltry
things
for
a
man
of
such
wisdom
to
bother
his
head
about
theron
looked
as
he
was
bidden
at
the
rows
of
hives
shining
in
the
hot
sun
on
a
bench
along
the
wall
but
offered
no
comment
beyond
a
casual
my
mother
was
always
going
to
keep
bees
but
somehow
she
never
got
around
to
it
they
say
it
pays
very
well
the
discovery
of
the
reason
why
no
bee
will
touch
the
nectar
of
the
epipactis
latifolia
though
it
is
sweet
to
our
taste
and
wasps
are
greedy
for
it
would
pay
commented
the
doctor
not
like
a
blue
rhododendron
in
mere
money
but
in
recognition
lots
of
men
have
achieved
a
in
the
britannica
on
a
smaller
basis
than
they
stood
now
at
the
end
of
the
garden
before
a
small
dilapidated
on
the
bench
inside
facing
him
theron
saw
a
strange
recumbent
figure
stretched
at
full
length
apparently
sound
asleep
or
it
might
be
dead
looking
closer
with
a
startled
surprise
he
made
out
the
shaven
skull
and
outlandish
garb
of
a
chinaman
he
turned
toward
his
guide
in
the
expectation
of
a
scene
the
doctor
had
already
taken
out
a
and
pencil
and
was
drawing
his
watch
from
his
pocket
he
stepped
into
the
and
lifting
the
oriental
limp
arm
took
account
of
his
pulse
then
with
head
bowed
low
he
listened
for
the
finally
he
somewhat
brusquely
pushed
back
one
of
the
chinaman
eyelids
and
made
a
minute
inspection
of
what
the
operation
disclosed
returning
to
the
light
he
inscribed
some
notes
in
his
book
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
and
came
out
in
answer
to
theron
marvelling
stare
he
pointed
toward
a
pipe
of
odd
construction
lying
on
the
floor
beneath
the
sleeper
this
is
one
of
my
regular
afternoon
duties
he
explained
again
with
the
whimsical
i
am
increasing
his
dose
monthly
by
regular
stages
and
the
results
promise
to
be
rather
remarkable
heretofore
observations
have
been
made
mostly
on
diseased
or
morbidly
deteriorated
subjects
this
fellow
of
mine
is
strong
as
an
ox
perfectly
nourished
and
watched
over
intelligently
he
can
assimilate
opium
enough
to
kill
you
and
me
and
every
other
vertebrate
creature
on
the
premises
without
turning
a
hair
and
he
has
got
even
fairly
under
way
the
thing
was
unpleasant
and
the
young
minister
turned
away
they
walked
together
up
the
path
toward
the
house
his
mind
was
full
now
of
the
hostile
things
which
celia
had
said
about
the
doctor
he
had
vaguely
sympathized
with
her
then
upon
no
special
knowledge
of
his
own
now
he
felt
that
his
sentiments
were
vehemently
in
accord
with
hers
the
doctor
was
a
beast
and
yet
as
they
moved
slowly
along
through
the
garden
the
thought
took
sudden
shape
in
his
mind
it
would
be
only
justice
for
him
to
get
also
the
doctor
opinion
of
celia
even
while
they
offended
and
repelled
him
he
could
not
close
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
experiments
and
occupations
were
those
of
a
patient
and
exact
man
of
science
a
philosopher
and
what
he
had
said
about
women
there
was
certainly
a
great
deal
of
acumen
and
shrewd
observation
in
that
if
he
would
only
say
what
he
really
thought
about
celia
and
about
her
relations
with
the
priest
yes
theron
recognized
now
there
was
nothing
else
that
he
so
much
needed
light
upon
as
those
puzzling
ties
between
celia
and
father
forbes
he
paused
with
a
simulated
curiosity
about
one
of
the
speaking
of
women
and
religion
he
began
in
as
casual
a
tone
as
he
could
command
i
notice
curiously
enough
in
my
own
case
that
as
i
develop
in
what
you
may
call
the
the
other
direction
my
wife
who
formerly
was
not
especially
devote
is
being
strongly
attracted
by
the
most
unthinking
and
hysterical
side
of
of
our
church
the
doctor
looked
at
him
nodded
and
stooped
to
nip
some
buds
from
a
stalk
in
the
bed
and
another
case
theron
went
on
of
course
it
was
all
so
new
and
strange
to
me
but
the
position
which
miss
madden
seems
to
occupy
about
the
catholic
church
here
i
suppose
you
had
her
in
mind
when
you
ledsmar
stood
up
my
mind
has
better
things
to
busy
itself
with
than
mad
asses
of
that
description
he
replied
she
is
not
worth
talking
about
a
mere
bundle
of
egotism
ignorance
and
lewdness
if
she
were
even
a
type
she
might
be
worth
considering
but
she
is
simply
an
abnormal
sport
with
a
little
brain
addled
by
notions
that
she
is
like
hypatia
and
a
large
impudence
rendered
intolerable
by
the
fact
that
she
has
money
her
father
is
a
decent
man
he
ought
to
have
her
ware
drew
himself
erect
as
he
listened
to
these
outrageous
words
it
would
be
unmanly
he
felt
to
allow
such
comments
upon
an
absent
friend
to
pass
unrebuked
yet
there
was
the
courtesy
due
to
a
host
to
be
considered
his
mind
fluttering
between
these
two
extremes
alighted
abruptly
upon
a
compromise
he
would
speak
so
as
to
show
his
disapproval
yet
not
so
as
to
prevent
his
finding
out
what
he
wanted
to
know
the
desire
to
hear
ledsmar
talk
about
celia
and
the
priest
seemed
now
to
have
possessed
him
for
a
long
time
to
have
dictated
his
unpremeditated
visit
out
here
to
have
been
growing
in
intensity
all
the
while
he
pretended
to
be
interested
in
orchids
and
bees
and
the
drugged
chinaman
it
tugged
passionately
at
his
as
he
spoke
i
can
not
in
the
least
assent
to
your
characterization
of
the
lady
he
began
with
rhetorical
dignity
bless
me
interposed
the
doctor
with
deceptive
cheerfulness
that
is
not
required
of
you
at
all
it
is
a
strictly
personal
opinion
offered
merely
as
a
contribution
to
the
general
sum
of
but
theron
went
on
feeling
his
way
of
course
i
gathered
that
evening
that
you
had
prejudices
in
the
matter
but
these
are
rather
apart
from
the
point
i
had
in
view
we
were
speaking
you
will
remember
of
the
traditional
attitude
of
women
toward
priests
wanting
to
curl
their
hair
and
put
flowers
in
it
you
know
and
that
suggested
to
me
some
individual
illustrations
and
it
occurred
to
me
to
wonder
just
what
were
the
relations
between
miss
madden
and
and
father
forbes
she
said
this
morning
for
instance
i
happened
to
meet
her
quite
by
accident
that
she
was
going
to
the
church
to
practise
a
new
piece
and
that
she
could
have
father
forbes
to
herself
all
day
now
that
would
be
quite
an
impossible
remark
in
our
that
is
in
any
protestant
circles
and
purely
as
a
matter
of
comparison
i
was
curious
to
ask
you
just
how
much
there
was
in
it
i
ask
you
because
going
there
so
much
you
have
had
exceptional
opportunities
for
a
sharp
exclamation
from
his
companion
interrupted
the
hesitating
monologue
it
began
like
a
violent
word
but
dwindled
suddenly
into
a
groan
of
pain
the
doctor
face
too
which
had
on
the
flash
of
theron
turning
seemed
given
over
to
unmixed
anger
took
on
an
expression
of
bodily
suffering
instead
my
shoulder
has
grown
all
at
once
excessively
painful
he
said
hastily
i
afraid
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
carrying
the
afflicted
side
with
ostentatious
caution
he
led
the
way
without
ado
round
the
house
to
the
front
gate
on
the
road
he
had
put
his
left
hand
under
his
coat
to
press
it
against
his
aching
shoulder
and
his
right
hung
palpably
helpless
this
rendered
it
impossible
for
him
to
shake
hands
with
his
guest
in
parting
you
sure
there
nothing
i
can
do
said
theron
lingering
on
the
outer
side
of
the
gate
i
used
to
rub
my
father
shoulders
and
back
i
gladly
oh
not
for
worlds
groaned
the
doctor
his
anguish
was
so
impressive
that
theron
as
he
walked
down
the
road
quite
missed
the
fact
that
there
had
been
no
invitation
to
come
again
ledsmar
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
his
gaze
meditatively
following
the
retreating
figure
then
he
went
in
opening
the
front
door
with
his
right
hand
and
carrying
himself
once
more
as
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
rheumatism
in
the
world
he
wandered
on
through
the
hall
into
the
laboratory
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
row
of
little
tanks
full
of
water
some
deliberation
was
involved
in
whatever
his
purpose
might
be
for
he
looked
from
one
tank
to
another
with
a
pondering
dilatory
gaze
at
last
he
plunged
his
hand
into
the
opaque
fluid
and
drew
forth
a
long
slim
lizard
with
a
coiling
sinuous
tail
and
a
pointed
evil
head
the
reptile
squirmed
and
doubled
itself
backward
around
his
wrist
darting
out
and
in
with
dizzy
swiftness
its
tiny
forked
tongue
the
doctor
held
the
thing
up
to
the
light
and
scrutinizing
it
through
his
spectacles
nodded
his
head
in
sedate
approval
a
grim
smile
curled
in
his
beard
yes
you
are
the
type
he
murmured
to
it
with
evident
enjoyment
in
the
conceit
your
name
is
johnny
any
more
it
the
rev
theron
chapter
xxii
the
annual
of
the
combined
methodist
districts
of
octavius
and
thessaly
was
held
this
year
in
the
second
half
of
september
a
little
later
than
usual
of
the
nine
days
devoted
to
this
curious
survival
of
primitive
wesleyanism
the
fifth
fell
upon
a
saturday
on
the
noon
of
that
day
the
rev
theron
ware
escaped
for
some
hours
from
the
burden
of
work
and
incessant
observation
which
he
shared
with
twenty
other
preachers
and
walked
alone
in
the
woods
the
scene
upon
which
he
turned
his
back
was
one
worth
looking
at
a
spacious
irregularly
defined
clearing
in
the
forest
lay
level
as
a
under
the
soft
haze
of
autumn
sunlight
in
the
centre
was
a
large
roughly
constructed
frame
building
untouched
by
paint
but
stained
and
with
time
behind
it
were
some
lines
of
and
still
further
on
in
that
direction
where
the
trees
began
the
eye
caught
fragmentary
glimpses
of
low
roofs
and
the
fronts
of
tiny
cottages
withdrawn
from
full
view
among
the
saplings
and
underbrush
at
the
other
side
of
the
clearing
fully
fourscore
tents
were
pitched
some
gray
and
mended
others
dazzlingly
white
in
their
newness
the
more
remote
of
these
tents
fell
into
an
orderly
arrangement
of
form
facing
that
part
of
the
engirdling
woods
where
the
trees
were
largest
and
their
canopy
of
overhanging
foliage
was
lifted
highest
from
the
ground
inside
this
of
tents
were
many
rounded
rows
of
benches
which
followed
in
narrowing
lines
the
idea
of
an
amphitheatre
cut
in
two
in
the
centre
just
under
the
edge
of
the
roof
of
boughs
rose
a
wooden
pagoda
in
form
not
unlike
an
stand
for
musicians
in
front
of
this
and
leading
from
it
on
the
level
of
its
floor
there
projected
a
platform
railed
round
with
aggressively
rustic
woodwork
the
nearest
benches
came
close
about
this
platform
at
the
hour
when
theron
started
away
there
were
few
enough
signs
of
life
about
this
encampment
the
four
or
five
hundred
people
who
were
in
constant
residence
were
eating
their
dinners
in
the
big
or
the
cottages
or
the
tents
it
was
not
the
time
of
day
for
strangers
even
when
services
were
in
progress
by
daylight
the
regular
attendants
did
not
make
much
of
a
show
huddled
in
a
mass
at
the
front
of
the
auditorium
by
comparison
with
the
great
green
and
blue
expanses
of
nature
about
them
the
real
spectacle
was
in
the
evening
when
as
the
shadows
gathered
big
clusters
of
kerosene
torches
hung
on
the
trees
facing
the
audience
were
lighted
the
falling
darkness
magnified
the
glow
of
the
lights
and
the
size
and
importance
of
what
they
illumined
the
preacher
bending
forward
over
the
rails
of
the
platform
and
fastening
his
eyes
upon
the
abashed
faces
of
those
on
the
anxious
seat
beneath
him
borrowed
an
effect
of
druidical
mystery
from
the
wall
of
blackness
about
him
from
the
flickering
reflections
on
the
branches
far
above
from
the
cool
night
air
which
stirred
across
the
clearing
the
change
was
in
the
blood
of
those
who
saw
and
heard
him
too
the
decorum
and
of
their
devotions
by
day
deepened
under
the
glare
of
the
torches
into
a
fervent
enthusiasm
even
before
the
services
began
and
if
there
was
in
the
rustic
pulpit
a
man
whose
prayers
or
exhortations
could
stir
their
pulses
they
sang
and
groaned
and
bellowed
out
their
praises
with
an
almost
barbarous
license
such
as
befitted
the
wilderness
but
in
the
evening
not
all
were
worshippers
for
a
dozen
miles
round
on
the
young
and
their
girls
regarded
the
as
perhaps
the
chief
event
of
the
year
no
more
to
be
missed
than
the
country
fair
or
the
circus
and
offering
from
many
points
of
view
more
opportunities
for
genuine
enjoyment
than
either
their
behavior
when
they
came
was
pretty
bad
not
the
less
so
because
all
the
rules
established
by
the
presiding
elders
for
the
regulation
of
strangers
took
it
for
granted
that
they
would
act
as
viciously
as
they
knew
how
these
sometimes
ventured
to
occupy
the
back
benches
where
the
light
was
dim
more
often
they
stood
outside
in
the
circular
space
between
the
tents
and
the
benches
and
mingled
drovers
yelps
and
all
sorts
of
mocking
cries
and
noises
with
the
amens
of
the
earnest
congregation
their
rough
on
the
fringe
of
the
sanctified
gathering
was
grievous
enough
everybody
knew
that
much
worse
things
went
on
further
out
in
the
surrounding
darkness
indeed
popular
report
gave
to
these
external
phases
of
the
an
even
more
evil
fame
than
attached
to
the
later
moonlight
or
the
least
reputable
of
the
midwinter
dances
at
dave
randall
low
halfway
house
cynics
said
that
the
methodists
found
consolation
for
this
scandal
in
the
large
income
they
derived
from
their
unruly
visitors
this
was
unfair
no
doubt
the
money
played
its
part
but
there
was
something
else
far
more
important
the
pious
dwellers
in
the
camp
intent
upon
reviving
in
their
poor
modern
way
the
character
and
environment
of
the
heroic
early
days
felt
the
need
of
just
this
hostile
and
scoffing
mob
about
them
to
bring
out
the
spirit
they
sought
theirs
was
a
fighting
religion
which
languished
in
peaceful
fair
weather
but
flamed
high
in
the
storm
the
throng
of
loafers
and
worldlings
of
both
sexes
with
their
jeering
interruptions
and
lewd
levity
of
conduct
brought
upon
the
scene
a
kind
of
visible
personal
devil
with
whom
the
chosen
could
do
battle
face
to
face
the
daylight
services
became
more
and
more
perfunctory
as
the
sojourn
in
the
woods
ran
its
course
and
interest
concentrated
itself
upon
the
night
meetings
for
the
reason
that
then
came
the
fierce
wrestle
with
a
beelzebub
of
flesh
and
blood
and
it
was
not
so
a
contest
either
no
evening
passed
without
its
victories
for
the
pulpit
careless
or
mischievous
young
people
who
were
pushed
into
the
foremost
ranks
of
the
mockers
and
stood
grinning
and
grimacing
under
the
lights
would
of
a
sudden
feel
a
spell
clamped
upon
them
they
would
hear
a
strange
quavering
note
in
the
preacher
voice
catch
the
sense
of
a
piercing
gleam
in
his
eye
not
at
all
to
be
resisted
these
occult
forces
would
take
control
of
them
drag
them
forward
as
in
a
dream
to
the
benches
under
the
pulpit
and
abase
them
there
like
worms
in
the
dust
and
then
the
preacher
would
descend
and
the
elders
advance
and
the
would
sway
and
dip
before
the
wind
of
the
mighty
roar
that
went
up
in
triumph
from
the
brethren
these
combats
with
satan
at
close
quarters
if
they
made
the
evenings
exciting
reacted
with
an
effect
of
crushing
dulness
upon
the
sunday
services
the
rule
was
to
admit
no
strangers
to
the
grounds
from
saturday
night
to
monday
morning
every
year
attempts
were
made
to
rescind
or
modify
this
rule
and
this
season
at
least
of
the
laymen
in
attendance
had
signed
a
petition
in
favor
of
opening
the
gates
the
two
presiding
elders
supported
by
a
dozen
of
the
older
preachers
resisted
the
change
and
they
had
the
backing
of
the
more
bigoted
section
of
the
congregation
from
octavius
the
controversy
reached
a
point
where
theron
presiding
elder
threatened
to
quit
the
grounds
and
the
leaders
of
the
movement
spoke
freely
of
the
ridiculous
figure
which
its
cranks
and
fanatics
made
poor
methodism
cut
in
the
eyes
of
modern
american
civilization
then
theron
ware
saw
his
opportunity
and
preached
an
impromptu
sermon
upon
the
sanctity
of
the
sabbath
which
ended
all
discussion
sometimes
its
arguments
seemed
to
be
on
one
side
sometimes
on
the
other
but
always
they
were
clothed
with
so
serene
a
beauty
of
imagery
and
moved
in
such
a
lofty
and
rarefied
atmosphere
of
spiritual
exaltation
that
it
was
impossible
to
link
them
to
so
sordid
a
thing
as
this
question
of
when
he
had
finished
nobody
wanted
the
gates
opened
the
two
factions
found
that
the
difference
between
them
had
melted
out
of
existence
they
sat
entranced
by
the
charm
of
the
sermon
then
glancing
around
at
the
empty
benches
glaringly
numerous
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
they
whispered
regrets
that
ten
thousand
people
had
not
been
there
to
hear
that
marvellous
discourse
theron
conquest
was
of
exceptional
dimensions
the
majority
whose
project
he
had
defeated
were
strangers
who
appreciated
and
admired
his
effort
most
the
little
minority
of
his
own
flock
though
less
susceptible
to
the
influence
of
graceful
diction
and
delicately
balanced
rhetoric
were
proud
of
the
distinction
he
had
reflected
upon
them
and
delighted
with
him
for
having
won
their
fight
the
presiding
elders
wrung
his
hand
with
a
significant
grip
the
extremists
of
his
own
charge
beamed
friendship
upon
him
for
the
first
time
he
was
the
veritable
hero
of
the
week
the
prestige
of
this
achievement
made
it
the
easier
for
theron
to
get
away
by
himself
next
day
and
walk
in
the
woods
a
man
of
such
power
had
a
right
to
solitude
those
who
noted
his
departure
from
the
camp
remembered
with
pleasure
that
he
was
to
preach
again
on
the
morrow
he
was
going
to
commune
with
god
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
that
the
message
next
day
might
be
clearer
and
more
luminous
still
theron
strolled
for
a
little
with
an
air
of
aimlessness
until
he
was
well
outside
the
more
or
less
frequented
neighborhood
of
the
camp
then
he
looked
at
the
sun
and
the
lay
of
the
land
with
that
informing
scrutiny
of
which
the
boy
never
loses
the
trick
turned
and
strode
at
a
rattling
pace
down
the
hillside
he
knew
nothing
personally
of
this
piece
of
woodland
a
spur
of
the
great
adirondack
wilderness
thrust
southward
into
the
region
of
homesteads
and
dairies
and
but
he
had
prepared
himself
by
a
study
of
the
map
and
he
knew
where
he
wanted
to
go
very
soon
he
hit
upon
the
path
he
had
counted
upon
finding
and
at
this
he
quickened
his
gait
three
months
of
the
new
life
had
wrought
changes
in
theron
he
bore
himself
more
erectly
for
one
thing
his
shoulders
were
thrown
back
and
seemed
thicker
the
alteration
was
even
more
obvious
in
his
face
the
effect
of
lank
wistful
sallow
juvenility
had
vanished
it
was
the
countenance
of
a
mature
and
confident
man
firmer
and
more
rounded
in
its
outlines
and
with
a
glow
of
health
on
its
whole
surface
under
the
chin
were
the
suggestions
of
fulness
which
bespeak
an
easy
mind
his
clothes
were
new
the
fitted
him
and
the
thin
autumn
overcoat
with
its
silk
lining
exposed
at
the
breast
gave
a
masculine
bulk
and
shape
to
his
figure
he
wore
a
shining
tall
hat
and
in
haste
though
he
was
took
pains
not
to
knock
it
against
branches
all
had
gone
well
more
than
well
with
him
the
second
quarterly
conference
had
passed
without
a
ripple
both
the
attendance
and
the
collections
at
his
church
were
larger
than
ever
before
and
the
tone
of
the
congregation
toward
him
was
altered
distinctly
for
the
better
as
for
himself
he
viewed
with
astonished
delight
the
progress
he
had
made
in
his
own
estimation
he
had
taken
sister
soulsby
advice
and
the
results
were
already
wonderful
he
had
put
aside
once
and
for
all
the
thousand
foolish
trifles
and
childish
perplexities
which
formerly
had
racked
his
brain
and
worried
him
out
of
sleep
and
strength
he
borrowed
all
sorts
of
books
boldly
now
from
the
octavius
public
library
and
could
swim
with
a
calm
mastery
and
enjoyment
upon
the
deep
waters
into
which
draper
and
lecky
and
laing
and
the
rest
had
hurled
him
he
dallied
pleasurably
a
little
languorously
with
a
dozen
aspects
of
the
case
against
revealed
religion
ranging
from
the
mild
heterodoxy
of
qualms
to
the
rude
ingersoll
rollicking
negation
of
god
himself
as
a
woman
of
coquetry
might
play
with
as
many
lovers
they
amused
him
they
were
all
before
him
to
choose
and
he
was
free
to
postpone
indefinitely
the
act
of
selection
there
was
a
sense
of
the
luxurious
in
this
position
which
softened
bodily
as
well
as
mental
fibres
he
ceased
to
grow
indignant
at
things
below
or
outside
his
standards
and
he
bought
a
small
book
which
treated
of
the
care
of
the
hand
and
finger
nails
alice
had
accepted
with
deference
his
explanation
that
shapely
hands
played
so
important
a
part
in
pulpit
oratory
for
that
matter
she
now
accepted
whatever
he
said
or
did
with
admirable
docility
it
was
months
since
he
could
remember
her
venturing
upon
a
critical
attitude
toward
him
she
had
not
wished
to
leave
home
for
the
seaside
or
any
other
resort
during
the
summer
but
had
worked
outside
in
her
garden
more
than
usual
this
was
inexpensive
and
it
seemed
to
do
her
as
much
good
as
a
holiday
could
have
done
her
new
devotional
zeal
was
now
quite
an
odd
thing
it
had
not
slackened
at
all
from
the
revival
pitch
at
the
outset
she
had
tried
several
times
to
talk
with
her
husband
upon
this
subject
he
had
discouraged
conversation
about
her
soul
and
its
welfare
at
first
obliquely
then
under
compulsion
with
some
directness
his
thoughts
were
absorbed
he
said
by
the
contemplation
of
vast
abstract
schemes
of
creation
and
the
government
of
the
universe
and
it
only
diverted
and
embarrassed
his
mind
to
try
to
fasten
it
upon
the
details
of
personal
salvation
thereafter
the
topic
was
not
broached
between
them
she
bestowed
a
good
deal
of
attention
too
upon
her
piano
the
knack
of
a
girlish
nimbleness
of
touch
had
returned
to
her
after
a
few
weeks
and
she
made
music
which
theron
supposed
was
very
good
for
her
it
pleased
him
at
all
events
when
he
sat
and
listened
to
it
but
he
had
a
far
greater
pleasure
as
he
listened
in
dwelling
upon
the
memories
of
the
yellow
and
blue
room
which
the
sounds
always
brought
up
although
three
months
had
passed
thurston
had
never
asked
for
the
first
payment
on
the
piano
or
even
sent
in
a
bill
this
impressed
him
as
being
peculiarly
graceful
behavior
on
his
part
and
he
recognized
its
delicacy
by
not
going
near
thurston
at
all
an
hour
sharp
walk
occasionally
broken
by
short
cuts
across
open
pastures
but
for
the
most
part
on
forest
paths
brought
theron
to
the
brow
of
a
small
knoll
free
from
underbrush
and
covered
sparsely
with
the
ground
was
soft
with
moss
and
the
powdered
remains
of
last
year
foliage
the
leaves
above
him
were
showing
the
first
yellow
stains
of
autumn
a
sweet
smell
of
ripening
nuts
was
thick
upon
the
air
and
busy
rustlings
and
chirpings
through
the
stillness
told
how
the
chipmunks
and
squirrels
were
attending
to
their
harvest
theron
had
no
ears
for
these
noises
of
the
woodland
he
had
halted
and
was
searching
through
the
little
vistas
offered
between
the
stout
gray
trunks
of
the
beeches
for
some
sign
of
a
more
sophisticated
sort
yes
there
were
certainly
voices
to
be
heard
down
in
the
hollow
and
now
beyond
all
possibility
of
mistake
there
came
up
to
him
the
low
rhythmic
throb
of
music
it
was
the
merest
faint
murmur
of
music
made
up
almost
wholly
of
groaning
bass
notes
but
it
was
enough
he
moved
down
the
slope
swiftly
at
first
then
with
increasing
caution
the
sounds
grew
louder
as
he
advanced
until
he
could
hear
the
harmony
of
the
other
strings
in
its
place
beside
the
uproar
of
the
big
fiddles
and
distinguish
from
both
the
measured
noise
of
many
feet
moving
as
one
he
reached
a
place
from
which
himself
unobserved
he
could
overlook
much
of
what
he
had
come
to
see
the
bottom
of
the
glade
below
him
lay
out
in
the
full
sunshine
as
flat
and
as
velvety
in
its
fresh
greenness
as
a
garden
lawn
its
open
expanse
was
big
enough
to
accommodate
several
distinct
crowds
and
here
the
crowds
were
one
massed
about
an
enclosure
in
which
young
men
were
playing
at
football
another
gathered
further
off
in
a
curve
at
the
end
of
a
baseball
diamond
and
a
third
thronging
at
a
point
where
the
shade
of
overhanging
woods
began
focussed
upon
a
centre
of
interest
which
theron
could
not
make
out
closer
at
hand
where
a
shallow
stream
rippled
along
over
its
bed
some
little
boys
with
legs
bared
to
the
thighs
were
paddling
about
under
the
charge
of
two
men
clad
in
long
black
gowns
there
were
others
of
these
frocked
monitors
scattered
here
and
there
upon
the
scene
pallid
monkish
figures
who
none
the
less
wore
modern
hats
and
superintended
with
knowledge
the
games
of
the
period
theron
remembered
that
these
were
the
christian
brothers
the
teachers
of
the
catholic
school
and
this
was
the
picnic
of
the
catholics
of
octavius
he
gazed
in
mingled
amazement
and
exhilaration
upon
the
spectacle
there
seemed
to
be
literally
thousands
of
people
on
the
open
fields
before
him
and
apparently
there
were
still
other
thousands
in
the
fringes
of
the
woods
round
about
the
noises
which
arose
from
this
multitude
the
shouts
of
the
lads
in
the
water
the
playful
squeals
of
the
girls
in
the
swings
the
fused
uproar
of
the
more
distant
crowds
and
above
all
the
diligent
ordered
strains
of
the
proceeding
from
some
invisible
distance
in
the
greenwood
charmed
his
ears
with
their
suggestion
of
universal
merriment
he
drew
a
long
breath
half
pleasure
half
wistful
regret
as
he
remembered
that
other
gathering
in
the
forest
which
he
had
left
behind
at
any
rate
it
should
be
well
behind
him
today
whatever
the
morrow
might
bring
evidently
he
was
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
circle
for
the
headquarters
of
the
festivities
he
turned
and
walked
to
the
right
through
the
beeches
making
a
detour
under
cover
of
the
crowds
at
play
at
last
he
rounded
the
long
oval
of
the
clearing
and
found
himself
at
the
very
edge
of
that
largest
throng
of
all
which
had
been
too
far
away
for
comprehension
at
the
beginning
there
was
no
mystery
now
a
rough
narrow
shed
fully
fifty
feet
in
length
imposed
itself
in
an
arbitrary
line
across
the
face
of
this
crowd
dividing
it
into
two
compact
halves
inside
this
shed
protected
all
round
by
a
barrier
of
boards
on
top
of
which
ran
a
flat
covering
were
twenty
men
in
their
toiling
ceaselessly
to
keep
abreast
of
the
crowd
thirst
for
beer
the
actions
of
these
bartenders
greatly
impressed
theron
they
moved
like
so
many
machines
using
one
hand
apparently
to
take
money
and
give
change
and
with
the
other
incessantly
sweeping
off
rows
of
empty
glasses
and
tossing
forward
in
their
place
fresh
foaming
glasses
five
at
a
time
hundreds
of
arms
and
hands
were
continually
stretched
out
on
both
sides
of
the
shed
toward
this
streaming
bar
and
through
the
babel
of
eager
cries
rose
without
pause
the
racket
of
mallets
tapping
new
kegs
theron
had
never
seen
any
considerable
number
of
his
engaged
in
drinking
lager
beer
before
his
surprise
at
the
facility
of
those
behind
the
bar
began
to
yield
upon
observation
to
a
profound
amazement
at
the
thirst
of
those
before
it
the
same
people
seemed
to
be
always
in
front
emptying
the
glasses
faster
than
the
busy
men
inside
could
replenish
them
and
clamoring
tirelessly
for
more
newcomers
had
to
force
their
way
to
the
bar
by
violent
efforts
and
once
there
they
stayed
until
pushed
bodily
aside
there
were
actually
women
to
be
seen
here
and
there
in
the
throng
elbowing
and
shoving
like
the
rest
for
a
place
at
the
front
some
of
the
more
gallant
young
men
fought
their
way
outward
from
time
to
time
carrying
for
safety
above
their
heads
glasses
of
beer
which
they
gave
to
young
and
pretty
girls
standing
on
the
fringe
of
the
crowd
among
the
trees
everywhere
a
remarkable
prevailed
once
a
sharp
fight
broke
out
just
at
the
end
of
the
bar
nearest
theron
and
one
young
man
was
knocked
down
a
rush
of
the
onlookers
confused
everything
before
the
minister
eyes
for
a
minute
and
then
he
saw
the
aggrieved
combatant
up
on
his
legs
again
consenting
under
the
kindly
pressure
of
the
crowd
to
shake
hands
with
his
antagonist
and
join
him
in
more
beer
the
incident
caught
his
fancy
there
was
something
very
pleasingly
human
he
thought
in
this
primitive
readiness
to
resort
to
fisticuffs
and
this
frank
and
genial
reconciliation
perhaps
there
was
something
contagious
in
this
wholesale
display
of
thirst
for
the
rev
ware
became
conscious
of
a
notion
that
he
should
like
to
try
a
glass
of
beer
he
recalled
having
heard
that
lager
was
really
a
most
harmless
beverage
of
course
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
he
should
show
himself
at
the
bar
perhaps
some
one
would
bring
him
out
a
glass
as
if
he
were
a
pretty
girl
he
looked
about
for
a
possible
messenger
turning
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
two
smiling
people
into
whose
eyes
he
stared
for
an
instant
in
dumfounded
blankness
then
his
countenance
flashed
with
joy
and
he
held
out
both
hands
in
greeting
it
was
father
forbes
and
celia
we
stole
down
upon
you
unawares
said
the
priest
in
his
cheeriest
manner
he
wore
a
brown
straw
hat
and
loose
clothes
hardly
at
all
clerical
in
form
and
had
miss
madden
arm
drawn
lightly
within
his
own
we
could
barely
believe
our
eyes
that
it
could
be
you
whom
we
saw
here
among
the
sinners
i
am
in
love
with
your
sinners
responded
theron
as
he
shook
hands
with
celia
and
trusted
himself
to
look
fully
into
her
eyes
i
had
five
days
of
the
saints
over
in
another
part
of
the
woods
and
bored
the
head
off
chapter
xxiii
at
the
command
of
father
forbes
a
lad
who
was
loitering
near
them
went
down
through
the
throng
to
the
bar
and
returned
with
three
glasses
of
beer
it
pleased
the
rev
ware
that
the
priest
should
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
he
would
do
as
the
others
did
he
knocked
his
glass
against
theirs
in
compliance
with
a
custom
strange
to
him
but
which
they
seemed
to
understand
very
well
the
beer
itself
was
not
so
agreeable
to
the
taste
as
he
had
expected
but
it
was
cold
and
refreshing
when
the
boy
had
returned
with
the
glasses
the
three
stood
for
a
moment
in
silence
meditatively
watching
the
curious
scene
spread
below
them
beyond
the
bar
theron
could
catch
now
through
the
trees
regularly
recurring
glimpses
of
four
or
five
swings
in
motion
these
were
nearest
him
and
clearest
to
the
vision
as
well
at
the
instant
when
they
reached
their
highest
forward
point
the
seats
were
filled
with
girls
some
of
them
quite
grown
young
women
and
their
curving
upward
sweep
through
the
air
was
disclosing
at
its
climax
a
remarkable
profusion
of
white
skirts
and
black
stockings
the
sight
struck
him
as
indecorous
in
the
extreme
and
he
turned
his
eyes
away
they
met
celia
and
there
was
something
latent
in
their
brown
depths
which
prompted
him
after
a
brief
dalliance
of
interchanging
glances
to
look
again
at
the
swings
that
old
maid
curran
is
really
too
ridiculous
with
those
white
stockings
of
hers
remarked
celia
some
friend
ought
to
tell
her
to
dye
or
pad
them
suggested
father
forbes
with
a
gay
little
chuckle
i
daresay
the
question
of
swings
and
ladies
stockings
hardly
arises
with
you
over
at
the
ware
theron
laughed
aloud
at
the
conceit
i
should
say
not
he
replied
i
just
dying
to
see
a
said
celia
you
hear
such
racy
accounts
of
what
goes
on
at
do
go
i
beg
of
you
urged
theron
with
doleful
emphasis
let
even
talk
about
them
i
should
like
to
feel
this
afternoon
as
if
there
was
no
such
thing
within
a
thousand
miles
of
me
as
a
do
you
know
all
this
interests
me
enormously
it
is
a
revelation
to
me
to
see
these
thousands
of
good
decent
ordinary
people
just
frankly
enjoying
themselves
like
human
beings
i
suppose
that
in
this
whole
huge
crowd
there
is
a
single
person
who
will
mention
the
subject
of
his
soul
to
any
other
person
all
day
i
should
think
the
assumption
was
a
safe
one
said
the
priest
smilingly
unless
he
added
on
afterthought
it
be
by
way
of
a
genial
profanity
there
used
to
be
some
old
clare
men
who
said
to
my
soul
when
they
missed
at
quoits
but
i
have
heard
it
for
a
long
time
i
daresay
they
all
i
shall
never
forget
that
where
i
saw
you
first
remarked
theron
musingly
i
date
from
that
experience
a
whole
new
life
i
have
been
greatly
struck
lately
in
reading
our
christian
to
see
in
the
obituary
notices
of
prominent
methodists
how
over
and
over
again
it
is
recorded
that
they
got
religion
in
their
youth
through
being
frightened
by
some
illness
of
their
own
or
some
epidemic
about
them
the
cholera
year
of
seems
to
have
made
methodists
hand
over
fist
even
to
this
day
our
most
successful
revivalists
those
who
work
conversions
wholesale
wherever
they
go
do
it
more
by
frightful
pictures
of
surrounding
the
sinner
than
anything
else
you
could
hear
the
same
thing
at
our
tonight
if
you
were
there
is
so
much
difference
as
you
think
said
father
forbes
dispassionately
your
people
keep
examining
their
souls
just
as
children
keep
pulling
up
the
bulbs
they
have
planted
to
see
are
there
any
roots
yet
our
people
are
more
satisfied
to
leave
their
souls
alone
once
they
have
been
planted
so
to
speak
by
baptism
but
fear
of
hell
governs
them
both
pretty
much
alike
as
i
remember
saying
to
you
once
before
there
is
really
nothing
new
under
the
sun
even
the
saying
new
though
there
seem
to
have
been
the
most
tremendous
changes
in
races
and
civilizations
and
religions
stretching
over
many
thousands
of
years
yet
nothing
is
in
fact
altered
very
much
where
religions
are
concerned
the
human
race
are
still
very
like
savages
in
a
dangerous
wood
in
the
dark
telling
one
another
ghost
stories
around
a
they
have
always
been
like
what
nonsense
cried
celia
i
have
no
patience
with
such
gloomy
rubbish
the
greeks
had
a
religion
full
of
beauty
and
happiness
and
and
they
were
frightened
of
death
at
all
they
made
the
image
of
death
a
beautiful
boy
with
a
torch
turned
down
their
greatest
philosophers
openly
preached
and
practised
the
doctrine
of
suicide
when
one
was
tired
of
life
our
own
early
church
was
full
of
these
broad
and
beautiful
greek
ideas
you
know
that
yourself
and
it
was
only
when
your
miserable
jeromes
and
augustines
and
cyrils
brought
in
the
abominable
meannesses
and
cruelties
of
the
jewish
old
testament
and
stamped
out
the
sane
and
lovely
greek
elements
in
the
church
that
christians
became
the
poor
whining
cowardly
egotists
they
are
troubling
about
their
little
souls
and
scaring
themselves
in
their
churches
by
skulls
and
my
dear
celia
interposed
the
priest
patting
her
shoulder
gently
we
will
have
no
greek
debate
today
ware
has
been
permitted
to
taboo
and
i
claim
the
privilege
to
cry
off
on
greeks
look
at
those
fellows
down
there
trampling
over
one
another
to
get
more
beer
what
have
they
to
do
with
athens
or
athens
with
them
i
take
it
ware
he
went
on
with
a
grave
face
but
a
twinkling
eye
that
what
we
are
observing
here
in
front
of
us
is
symbolical
of
a
great
ethical
and
theological
revolution
which
in
time
will
modify
and
control
the
destiny
of
the
entire
american
people
you
see
those
young
irishmen
there
struggling
like
pigs
at
a
trough
to
get
their
fill
of
german
beer
that
signifies
a
conquest
of
teuton
over
kelt
more
important
and
in
its
results
than
the
landing
of
hengist
and
horsa
the
kelt
has
come
to
grief
heretofore
or
at
least
been
forced
to
play
second
fiddle
to
other
races
because
he
lacked
the
right
sort
of
a
drink
he
has
in
his
blood
an
excess
of
impulsive
imaginative
even
fantastic
qualities
it
is
much
easier
for
him
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
to
begin
with
than
it
is
for
people
of
slower
wits
and
more
sluggish
temperaments
when
you
add
whiskey
to
that
or
that
essence
of
melancholia
which
in
ireland
they
call
you
get
the
kelt
at
his
very
weakest
and
worst
these
young
men
down
there
are
changing
all
that
they
have
discovered
lager
already
many
of
them
can
outdrink
the
germans
at
their
own
beverage
the
irishman
in
a
few
generations
will
be
a
new
type
of
humanity
the
kelt
at
his
best
he
will
dominate
america
he
will
be
the
american
and
his
church
with
the
italian
element
thrown
clean
out
of
it
and
its
pope
living
say
in
baltimore
or
georgetown
will
be
the
church
of
let
us
have
some
more
lager
at
once
put
in
celia
this
revolution
ca
be
hurried
forward
too
theron
could
not
feel
sure
how
much
of
the
priest
discourse
was
in
jest
how
much
in
earnest
it
seems
to
me
he
said
that
as
things
are
going
it
does
look
much
as
if
the
america
of
the
future
will
trouble
itself
about
any
kind
of
a
church
the
march
of
science
must
very
soon
produce
a
universal
scepticism
it
is
in
the
nature
of
human
progress
what
all
intelligent
men
recognize
today
the
masses
must
surely
come
to
see
in
father
forbes
laughed
outright
this
time
my
dear
ware
he
said
as
they
touched
glasses
again
and
sipped
the
fresh
beer
that
had
been
brought
them
of
all
our
fictions
there
is
none
so
utterly
baseless
and
empty
as
this
idea
that
humanity
progresses
the
savage
natural
impression
is
that
the
world
he
sees
about
him
was
made
for
him
and
that
the
rest
of
the
universe
is
subordinated
to
him
and
his
world
and
that
all
the
spirits
and
demons
and
gods
occupy
themselves
exclusively
with
him
and
his
affairs
that
idea
was
the
basis
of
every
pagan
religion
and
it
is
the
basis
of
the
christian
religion
simply
because
it
is
the
foundation
of
human
nature
that
foundation
is
just
as
firm
and
unshaken
today
as
it
was
in
the
stone
age
it
will
always
remain
and
upon
it
will
always
be
built
some
kind
of
a
religious
superstructure
men
as
you
call
them
really
have
very
little
influence
even
when
they
all
pull
one
way
the
people
as
a
whole
soon
get
tired
of
them
they
give
too
much
trouble
the
most
powerful
forces
in
human
nature
are
and
inertia
the
man
has
found
out
that
the
chief
wisdom
in
life
is
to
bend
to
the
pressures
about
him
to
shut
up
and
do
as
others
do
even
when
he
thinks
he
has
rid
his
own
mind
of
superstitions
he
sees
that
he
will
best
enjoy
a
peaceful
life
by
leaving
other
peoples
superstitions
alone
that
is
always
the
ultimate
view
of
the
but
i
do
see
observed
theron
granting
that
all
this
is
true
how
you
think
the
catholic
church
will
come
out
on
top
i
could
understand
it
of
unitarianism
or
universalism
or
the
episcopal
church
where
nobody
seems
to
have
to
believe
particularly
in
anything
except
the
beauty
of
its
burial
service
but
i
should
think
the
very
rigidity
of
the
catholic
creed
would
make
it
impossible
there
everything
is
hard
and
fast
nothing
is
elastic
there
is
no
room
for
the
church
is
always
compromising
explained
the
priest
only
it
does
it
so
slowly
that
no
one
man
lives
long
enough
to
quite
catch
it
at
the
trick
no
the
great
secret
of
the
catholic
church
is
that
it
debate
with
sceptics
no
matter
what
points
you
make
against
it
it
is
never
betrayed
into
answering
back
it
simply
says
these
things
are
sacred
mysteries
which
you
are
quite
free
to
accept
and
be
saved
or
reject
and
be
damned
there
is
something
intelligible
and
fine
about
an
attitude
like
that
when
people
have
grown
tired
of
their
absurd
and
fruitless
wrangling
over
texts
and
creeds
which
humanly
speaking
are
all
barbaric
nonsense
they
will
come
back
to
repose
pleasantly
under
the
catholic
roof
in
that
restful
house
where
things
are
taken
for
granted
there
the
manners
are
charming
the
service
excellent
the
decoration
and
upholstery
most
acceptable
to
the
eye
and
the
music
he
made
a
little
mock
bow
here
to
celia
the
music
at
least
is
divine
there
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
be
agreeable
and
avoid
scandal
and
observe
the
convenances
you
are
no
more
expected
to
express
doubts
about
the
immaculate
conception
than
you
are
to
ask
the
lady
whom
you
take
down
to
dinner
how
old
she
is
now
that
is
as
i
have
said
an
intelligent
and
rational
church
for
people
to
have
as
the
irish
civilize
themselves
you
observe
them
diligently
engaged
in
the
process
down
below
there
and
the
social
roughness
of
their
church
becomes
softened
and
ameliorated
americans
will
inevitably
be
attracted
toward
it
in
the
end
it
will
embrace
them
all
and
be
modified
by
them
and
in
turn
influence
their
development
till
you
will
have
a
new
nation
and
a
new
national
church
each
representative
of
the
and
all
this
is
to
be
done
by
lager
beer
theron
ventured
to
comment
jokingly
he
was
conscious
of
a
novel
perspiration
around
the
bridge
of
his
nose
which
was
obviously
another
effect
of
the
drink
the
priest
passed
the
pleasantry
by
no
he
said
seriously
what
you
must
see
is
that
there
must
always
be
a
church
if
one
did
not
exist
it
would
be
necessary
to
invent
it
it
is
needed
first
and
foremost
as
a
police
force
it
is
needed
secondly
so
to
speak
as
a
fire
insurance
it
provides
the
most
even
temperature
and
pure
atmosphere
for
the
growth
of
young
children
it
furnishes
the
best
obtainable
social
machinery
for
marrying
off
one
daughters
getting
to
know
the
right
people
patching
up
quarrels
and
so
on
the
priesthood
earn
their
salaries
as
the
agents
for
these
valuable
social
arrangements
their
theology
is
thrown
in
as
a
sort
of
intellectual
diversion
like
the
ritual
of
a
benevolent
organization
there
are
some
who
get
excited
about
this
part
of
it
just
as
one
hears
of
who
believe
that
the
sun
rises
and
sets
to
exemplify
their
ceremonies
others
take
their
duties
more
quietly
and
understanding
just
what
it
all
amounts
to
make
the
best
of
it
like
you
and
theron
assented
to
the
philosophy
and
the
compliment
by
a
grave
bow
yes
that
is
the
idea
to
make
the
best
of
it
he
said
and
fastened
his
regard
boldly
this
time
upon
the
swings
we
were
both
ordained
by
our
bishops
continued
the
priest
at
an
age
when
those
worthy
old
gentlemen
would
not
have
trusted
our
combined
wisdom
to
buy
a
horse
for
and
i
was
married
broke
in
theron
with
an
eagerness
almost
vehement
when
i
had
only
just
been
ordained
at
the
worst
you
had
only
the
church
fastened
upon
your
back
before
you
were
old
enough
to
know
what
you
wanted
it
is
easy
enough
to
make
the
best
of
that
but
it
is
different
with
a
marked
silence
followed
this
outburst
the
rev
ware
had
never
spoken
of
his
marriage
to
either
of
these
friends
before
and
something
in
their
manner
seemed
to
suggest
that
they
did
not
find
the
subject
inviting
now
that
it
had
been
broached
he
himself
was
filled
with
a
desire
to
say
more
about
it
he
had
never
clearly
realized
before
what
a
genuine
grievance
it
was
the
moisture
at
the
top
of
his
nose
merged
itself
into
tears
in
the
corners
of
his
eyes
as
the
cruel
enormity
of
the
sacrifice
he
had
made
in
his
youth
rose
before
him
his
whole
life
had
been
fettered
and
darkened
by
it
he
turned
his
gaze
from
the
swings
toward
celia
to
claim
the
sympathy
he
knew
she
would
feel
for
him
but
celia
was
otherwise
engaged
a
young
man
had
come
up
to
her
a
tall
and
extremely
thin
young
man
soberly
dressed
and
with
a
long
gaunt
face
the
skin
of
which
seemed
at
once
florid
and
pale
he
had
sandy
hair
and
the
rough
hands
of
a
workman
but
he
was
speaking
to
miss
madden
in
the
confidential
tones
of
an
equal
i
can
do
nothing
at
all
with
him
this
newcomer
said
to
her
not
be
said
by
me
perhaps
he
listen
to
you
it
likely
i
go
down
there
said
celia
he
may
do
what
he
likes
for
all
me
take
my
advice
michael
and
just
go
your
way
and
leave
him
to
himself
there
was
a
time
when
i
would
have
taken
out
my
eyes
for
him
but
it
was
love
wasted
and
thrown
away
after
the
warnings
had
if
he
will
bring
trouble
on
himself
let
make
it
no
affair
of
theron
had
found
himself
exchanging
glances
of
inquiry
with
this
young
man
mr
ware
said
celia
here
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
brother
michael
my
full
ware
remembered
him
now
and
began
in
response
to
the
formal
bow
to
say
something
about
their
having
met
in
the
dark
inside
the
church
but
celia
held
up
her
hand
i
afraid
ware
she
said
hurriedly
that
you
are
in
for
a
glimpse
of
the
family
skeleton
i
will
apologize
for
the
infliction
in
wonderingly
theron
followed
her
look
and
saw
another
young
man
who
had
come
up
the
path
from
the
crowd
below
and
was
close
upon
them
the
minister
recognized
in
him
a
figure
which
had
seemed
to
be
the
centre
of
almost
every
group
about
the
bar
that
he
had
studied
in
detail
he
was
a
small
dapper
elegantly
attired
youth
with
dark
hair
and
the
handsome
regularly
carved
face
of
an
actor
he
advanced
with
a
smiling
countenance
and
unsteady
step
his
silk
hat
thrust
back
upon
his
head
his
and
vest
unbuttoned
and
his
neckwear
disarranged
and
saluted
the
company
with
amiability
i
saw
you
up
here
father
forbes
he
said
with
a
thickened
and
erratic
utterance
why
you
come
down
and
join
us
i
setting
up
for
everybody
you
got
to
take
care
of
the
boys
you
know
i
blow
in
the
last
cent
i
got
in
the
world
for
the
boys
every
time
and
they
know
it
they
solider
for
me
than
they
ever
were
for
anybody
how
it
is
if
you
stand
by
the
boys
the
boys
stand
by
you
i
going
to
the
assembly
for
this
district
and
they
ai
nobody
can
stop
me
the
boys
are
just
red
hot
for
me
wish
you
come
down
father
forbes
and
address
a
few
words
to
the
meeting
just
mention
that
i
a
candidate
and
say
i
bound
to
win
hands
down
that
make
you
solid
with
the
boys
and
we
be
all
good
fellows
together
come
on
down
the
priest
affably
disengaged
his
arm
from
the
clutch
which
the
speaker
had
laid
upon
it
and
shook
his
head
in
gentle
deprecation
no
no
you
must
excuse
me
theodore
he
said
we
must
meddle
in
politics
you
politics
be
damned
urged
theodore
grabbing
the
priest
other
arm
and
tugging
at
it
stoutly
to
pull
him
down
the
path
i
say
boys
he
shouted
to
those
below
here
father
forbes
and
he
going
to
come
down
and
address
the
meeting
come
on
father
come
down
and
have
a
drink
with
the
boys
it
was
celia
who
sharply
pulled
his
hand
away
from
the
priest
arm
this
time
go
away
with
you
she
snapped
in
low
angry
tones
at
the
intruder
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
if
you
ca
keep
sober
yourself
you
can
at
least
keep
your
hands
off
the
priest
i
should
think
you
have
more
decency
when
you
in
such
a
state
as
this
than
to
come
where
i
am
if
you
no
respect
for
yourself
you
might
have
that
much
respect
for
me
and
before
strangers
too
oh
i
must
come
where
you
are
eh
remarked
the
peccant
theodore
straightening
himself
with
an
elaborate
effort
you
bought
these
woods
have
you
i
got
a
hundred
friends
here
all
the
same
for
every
one
you
ever
have
in
your
life
and
do
you
forget
go
and
spend
your
money
with
them
then
and
do
come
insulting
decent
people
said
celia
before
strangers
too
the
young
man
called
out
with
beery
sarcasm
oh
we
take
care
of
the
strangers
all
he
had
not
seemed
to
be
aware
of
theron
presence
much
less
his
identity
before
but
he
turned
to
him
now
with
a
knowing
grin
i
running
for
the
assembly
ware
he
said
speaking
loudly
and
with
deliberate
effort
to
avoid
the
drunken
elisions
and
comminglings
to
which
his
speech
tended
and
i
want
you
to
fix
up
the
methodists
solid
for
me
i
going
to
drive
over
to
the
tonight
me
and
some
of
the
boys
in
a
barouche
and
i
put
a
bill
on
their
plate
here
it
is
now
if
you
want
to
see
as
the
young
man
began
fumbling
in
a
theron
gathered
his
wits
together
you
better
not
go
this
evening
he
said
as
convincingly
as
he
knew
how
because
the
gates
will
be
closed
very
early
and
the
services
are
of
a
particularly
special
nature
quite
reserved
for
those
living
on
the
rats
said
theodore
raising
his
head
and
abandoning
the
search
for
the
bill
why
do
you
speak
out
like
a
man
and
say
you
think
i
too
drunk
i
do
think
that
is
a
question
which
need
arise
between
us
madden
murmured
theron
confusedly
oh
do
you
make
any
mistake
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
questions
arise
between
us
ware
cried
theodore
with
a
sudden
accession
of
vigor
in
tone
and
mien
and
one
of
is
go
away
from
me
michael
one
of
is
i
say
why
do
you
leave
our
girls
alone
they
got
their
own
priests
to
make
fools
of
themselves
over
without
any
sneak
of
a
protestant
parson
coming
meddling
round
them
you
a
married
man
into
the
bargain
and
you
got
in
your
house
this
minute
a
piano
that
my
sister
bought
and
paid
for
oh
i
seen
the
entry
in
thurston
books
you
have
the
cheek
to
talk
to
me
about
being
drunk
why
these
remarks
were
never
concluded
for
father
forbes
here
clapped
a
hand
abruptly
over
the
offending
mouth
and
flung
his
free
arm
in
a
tight
grip
around
the
young
man
waist
come
with
me
michael
he
said
and
the
two
men
led
the
reluctant
and
resisting
theodore
at
a
sharp
pace
off
into
the
woods
theron
and
celia
stood
and
watched
them
disappear
among
the
undergrowth
it
the
dirty
foley
blood
that
in
him
he
heard
her
say
as
if
between
clenched
teeth
the
girl
big
brown
eyes
when
theron
looked
into
them
again
were
still
fixed
upon
the
screen
of
foliage
and
dilated
like
those
of
a
medusa
mask
the
blood
had
gone
away
and
left
the
fair
face
and
neck
as
white
it
seemed
to
him
as
marble
even
her
lips
fiercely
bitten
together
appeared
colorless
the
picture
of
consuming
and
powerless
rage
which
she
presented
and
the
shuddering
tremor
which
ran
over
her
form
as
visible
as
the
quivering
track
of
a
gust
of
wind
across
a
pond
awed
and
frightened
him
tenderness
toward
her
helpless
state
came
too
and
uppermost
he
drew
her
arm
into
his
and
turned
their
backs
upon
the
picnic
scene
let
us
walk
a
little
up
the
path
into
the
woods
he
said
and
get
away
from
all
the
further
away
the
better
she
answered
bitterly
and
he
felt
the
shiver
run
through
her
again
as
she
spoke
the
methodical
from
that
unseen
dancing
platform
rose
again
above
all
other
sounds
they
moved
up
the
woodland
path
their
steps
insensibly
falling
into
the
rhythm
of
its
strains
and
vanished
from
sight
among
the
trees
chapter
xxiv
theron
and
celia
walked
in
silence
for
some
minutes
until
the
noises
of
the
throng
they
had
left
behind
were
lost
the
path
they
followed
had
grown
indefinite
among
the
grass
and
creepers
of
the
forest
carpet
now
it
seemed
to
end
altogether
in
a
little
copse
of
young
birches
the
delicately
graceful
stems
of
which
were
clustered
about
a
parent
stump
long
since
decayed
and
overgrown
with
lichens
and
layers
of
thick
moss
as
the
two
paused
the
girl
suddenly
sank
upon
her
knees
then
threw
herself
face
forward
upon
the
soft
green
bark
which
had
formed
itself
above
the
roots
of
the
ancient
her
companion
looked
down
in
pained
amazement
at
what
he
saw
her
body
shook
with
the
violence
of
recurring
sobs
or
rather
gasps
of
wrath
and
grief
her
hands
with
stiffened
fingers
dug
into
the
moss
and
tangle
of
tiny
vines
and
tore
them
by
the
roots
the
sounds
of
weeping
that
arose
from
where
her
face
grovelled
in
the
leaves
were
terrible
to
his
ears
he
knew
not
what
to
say
or
do
but
gazed
in
resourceless
suspense
at
the
strange
figure
she
made
it
seemed
a
cruelly
long
time
that
she
lay
there
almost
at
his
feet
struggling
fiercely
with
the
fury
that
was
in
her
all
at
once
the
paroxysms
passed
away
the
sounds
of
wild
weeping
ceased
celia
sat
up
and
with
her
handkerchief
wiped
the
tears
and
leafy
fragments
from
her
face
she
rearranged
her
hat
and
the
braids
of
her
hair
with
swift
instinctive
touches
brushed
the
woodland
debris
from
her
front
and
sprang
to
her
feet
i
all
right
now
she
said
briskly
there
was
palpable
effort
in
her
light
tone
and
in
the
stormy
sort
of
smile
which
she
forced
upon
her
blotched
and
perturbed
countenance
but
they
were
only
too
welcome
to
theron
anxious
mood
thank
god
he
blurted
out
all
radiant
with
relief
i
feared
you
were
going
to
have
a
fit
or
celia
laughed
a
little
artificially
at
first
then
with
a
genuine
surrender
to
the
comic
side
of
his
visible
fright
the
mirth
came
back
into
the
brown
depths
of
her
eyes
again
and
her
face
cleared
itself
of
and
the
marks
of
agitation
i
am
a
nice
quiet
party
for
a
methodist
minister
to
go
walking
in
the
woods
with
am
i
not
she
cried
shaking
her
skirts
and
smiling
at
him
i
am
not
a
methodist
minister
please
answered
theron
at
least
not
today
and
here
with
you
i
am
just
a
man
nothing
more
a
man
who
has
escaped
from
lifelong
imprisonment
and
feels
for
the
first
time
what
it
is
to
be
free
ah
my
friend
celia
said
shaking
her
head
slowly
i
afraid
you
deceive
yourself
you
are
not
by
any
means
free
you
are
only
looking
out
of
the
window
of
your
prison
as
you
call
it
the
doors
are
locked
just
the
i
will
smash
them
he
declared
with
confidence
or
for
that
matter
i
have
smashed
them
battered
them
to
pieces
you
do
realize
what
progress
i
have
made
what
changes
there
have
been
in
me
since
that
night
you
remember
that
wonderful
night
i
am
quite
another
being
i
assure
you
and
really
it
dates
from
way
beyond
that
why
from
the
very
first
evening
when
i
came
to
you
in
the
church
the
window
in
father
forbes
room
was
open
and
i
stood
by
it
listening
to
the
music
next
door
and
i
could
just
faintly
see
on
the
dark
window
across
the
a
picture
of
a
woman
i
suppose
it
was
the
virgin
mary
she
had
hair
like
yours
and
your
face
too
and
that
is
why
i
went
into
the
church
and
found
you
yes
that
is
celia
regarded
him
with
gravity
you
will
get
yourself
into
great
trouble
my
friend
she
said
that
where
you
wrong
put
in
theron
not
that
i
mind
any
trouble
in
this
wide
world
so
long
as
you
called
me
friend
but
i
not
going
to
get
into
any
at
all
i
know
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
i
learned
to
be
a
showman
i
can
preach
now
far
better
than
i
used
to
and
i
can
get
through
my
work
in
half
the
time
and
keep
on
the
right
side
of
my
people
and
get
along
with
perfect
smoothness
i
was
too
green
before
i
took
the
thing
seriously
and
i
let
every
curmudgeon
and
crazy
fanatic
worry
me
and
keep
me
on
pins
and
needles
i
do
do
that
any
more
i
taken
a
new
measure
of
life
i
see
now
what
life
is
really
worth
and
i
going
to
have
my
share
of
it
why
should
i
deliberately
deny
myself
all
possible
happiness
for
the
rest
of
my
days
simply
because
i
made
a
fool
of
myself
when
i
was
in
my
teens
other
men
are
not
eternally
punished
like
that
for
what
they
did
as
boys
and
i
wo
submit
to
it
either
i
will
be
as
free
to
enjoy
myself
as
as
father
celia
smiled
softly
and
shook
her
head
again
poor
man
to
call
him
free
she
said
why
he
is
bound
hand
and
foot
you
do
in
the
least
realize
how
he
is
hedged
about
the
work
he
has
to
do
the
thousand
suspicious
eyes
that
watch
his
every
movement
eager
to
bring
the
bishop
down
upon
him
and
then
think
of
his
sacrifice
the
great
sacrifice
of
all
to
never
know
what
love
means
to
forswear
his
manhood
to
live
a
forlorn
celibate
life
you
have
no
idea
how
sadly
that
appeals
to
a
let
us
sit
down
here
for
a
little
said
theron
we
seem
at
the
end
of
the
she
seated
herself
on
the
mound
and
he
reclined
at
her
side
with
an
arm
carelessly
extended
behind
her
on
the
moss
i
can
see
what
you
mean
he
went
on
after
a
pause
but
to
me
do
you
know
there
is
an
enormous
fascination
in
celibacy
you
forget
that
i
know
the
reverse
of
the
medal
i
know
how
the
mind
can
be
cramped
the
nerves
harassed
the
ambitions
spoiled
and
rotted
the
whole
existence
darkened
and
belittled
by
by
the
other
thing
i
have
never
talked
to
you
before
about
my
i
do
think
we
better
talk
about
it
now
observed
celia
there
must
be
many
more
amusing
he
missed
the
spirit
of
her
remark
you
are
right
he
said
slowly
it
is
too
sad
a
thing
to
talk
about
but
there
it
is
my
load
and
i
bear
it
and
there
nothing
more
to
be
theron
drew
a
heavy
sigh
and
let
his
fingers
toy
abstractedly
with
a
ribbon
on
the
outer
edge
of
celia
penumbra
of
apparel
no
she
said
we
must
snivel
and
we
must
sulk
when
i
get
into
a
rage
it
makes
me
ill
and
i
storm
my
way
through
it
and
tear
things
but
it
does
last
long
and
i
come
out
of
it
feeling
all
the
better
i
do
know
that
i
ever
seen
your
wife
i
suppose
she
has
got
red
hair
i
think
it
a
kind
of
light
brown
answered
theron
with
an
effect
of
exerting
his
memory
it
seems
that
you
only
take
notice
of
hair
in
windows
was
celia
comment
he
murmured
reproachfully
as
if
as
if
but
i
wo
say
what
i
was
going
that
not
fair
she
said
the
little
touch
of
whimsical
mockery
which
she
gave
to
the
serious
declaration
was
delicious
to
him
you
have
me
at
such
a
disadvantage
here
am
i
rattling
out
whatever
comes
into
my
head
exposing
all
my
lightest
emotions
and
laying
bare
my
very
heart
in
candor
and
you
meditate
you
turn
things
over
cautiously
in
your
mind
like
a
second
machiavelli
i
grow
afraid
of
you
you
are
so
subtle
and
mysterious
in
your
theron
gave
a
tug
at
the
ribbon
to
show
the
joy
he
had
in
her
delicate
chaff
no
it
is
you
who
are
secretive
he
said
you
never
told
me
about
about
the
the
word
was
out
a
minute
before
it
had
seemed
incredible
to
him
that
he
should
ever
have
the
courage
to
utter
it
but
here
it
was
he
laid
firm
hold
upon
the
ribbon
which
it
appeared
hung
from
her
waist
and
drew
himself
a
trifle
nearer
to
her
i
could
never
have
consented
to
take
it
i
afraid
he
went
on
in
a
low
voice
if
i
had
known
and
even
as
it
is
i
fear
it
wo
be
what
are
you
afraid
of
asked
celia
why
should
you
take
it
people
in
your
profession
never
do
get
anything
unless
it
given
to
them
do
they
i
always
understood
it
was
like
that
i
often
read
of
donation
parties
that
what
they
called
is
it
where
everybody
is
supposed
to
bring
some
gift
to
the
minister
very
well
then
i
simply
had
a
donation
party
of
my
own
that
all
unless
you
mean
that
my
being
a
catholic
makes
a
difference
i
had
supposed
you
were
quite
free
from
that
kind
of
so
i
am
believe
me
i
am
urged
theron
when
i
with
you
it
seems
impossible
to
realize
that
there
are
people
so
narrow
and
contracted
in
their
natures
as
to
take
account
of
such
things
it
is
another
atmosphere
that
i
breathe
near
you
how
could
you
imagine
that
such
a
thought
about
our
difference
of
creed
would
enter
my
head
in
fact
he
concluded
with
a
nervous
there
is
any
such
difference
whatever
your
religion
is
it
mine
too
you
remember
you
adopted
me
as
a
did
i
she
rejoined
well
if
that
the
case
it
leaves
you
without
a
leg
to
stand
on
i
challenge
you
to
find
any
instance
where
a
greek
made
any
difficulties
about
accepting
a
piano
from
a
friend
but
seriously
while
we
are
talking
about
it
you
introduced
the
subject
i
did
i
might
as
well
explain
to
you
that
i
had
no
such
intention
when
i
picked
the
instrument
out
it
was
later
when
i
was
talking
to
thurston
people
about
the
price
that
the
whim
seized
me
now
it
is
the
one
fixed
rule
of
my
life
to
obey
my
whims
whatever
occurs
to
me
as
a
possibly
pleasant
thing
to
do
straight
like
a
hash
i
go
and
do
it
it
is
the
only
way
that
a
person
with
means
with
plenty
of
money
can
preserve
any
freshness
of
character
if
they
stop
to
think
what
it
would
be
prudent
to
do
they
get
crusted
over
immediately
that
is
the
curse
of
rich
people
they
teach
themselves
to
distrust
and
restrain
every
impulse
toward
unusual
actions
they
get
to
feel
that
it
is
more
necessary
for
them
to
be
cautious
and
conventional
than
it
is
for
others
i
would
rather
work
at
a
than
occupy
that
attitude
toward
my
bank
account
i
fight
against
any
sign
of
it
that
i
detect
rising
in
my
mind
the
instant
a
wish
occurs
to
me
i
rush
to
gratify
it
that
is
my
theory
of
life
that
accounts
for
the
piano
and
i
see
that
you
anything
to
say
about
it
at
it
seemed
very
convincing
this
theory
of
life
somehow
the
thought
of
miss
madden
riches
had
never
before
assumed
prominence
in
mind
of
course
her
father
was
very
wealthy
but
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
the
daughter
emancipation
might
run
to
the
length
of
a
personal
fortune
he
knew
so
little
of
rich
people
and
their
ways
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
up
at
celia
with
an
awakened
humility
and
awe
in
his
glance
the
glamour
of
a
separate
shone
upon
her
where
the
soft
woodland
light
played
in
among
the
strands
of
her
disordered
hair
he
saw
the
veritable
gleam
of
gold
a
mysterious
new
suggestion
of
power
blended
itself
with
the
beauty
of
her
face
was
exhaled
in
the
faint
perfume
of
her
garments
he
maintained
a
timorous
hold
upon
the
ribbon
wondering
at
his
hardihood
in
touching
it
or
being
near
her
at
all
what
surprises
me
he
heard
himself
saying
is
that
you
are
contented
to
stay
in
octavius
i
should
think
that
you
would
travel
go
abroad
see
the
beautiful
things
of
the
world
surround
yourself
with
the
luxuries
of
big
cities
and
that
sort
of
celia
regarded
the
forest
prospect
straight
in
front
of
her
with
a
pensive
gaze
sometime
no
doubt
i
will
sometime
she
said
abstractedly
one
reads
so
much
nowadays
he
went
on
of
american
heiresses
going
to
europe
and
marrying
dukes
and
noblemen
i
suppose
you
will
do
that
too
princes
would
fight
one
another
for
the
least
touch
of
a
smile
softened
for
an
instant
the
impassivity
of
her
countenance
then
she
stared
harder
than
ever
at
the
vague
leafy
distance
that
is
the
idea
she
said
in
a
musing
tone
that
women
must
belong
to
somebody
as
if
they
were
curios
or
statues
or
you
do
understand
my
friend
that
i
have
a
different
view
i
am
myself
and
i
belong
to
myself
exactly
as
much
as
any
man
the
notion
that
any
other
human
being
could
conceivably
obtain
the
slightest
property
rights
in
me
is
as
preposterous
as
ridiculous
as
what
shall
i
say
as
the
notion
of
your
being
taken
out
with
a
chain
on
your
neck
and
sold
by
auction
as
a
slave
down
on
the
canal
bridge
i
should
be
ashamed
to
be
alive
for
another
day
if
any
other
thought
were
possible
to
that
is
not
the
generally
accepted
view
i
should
think
faltered
theron
no
more
is
it
the
accepted
view
that
young
married
methodist
ministers
should
sit
out
alone
in
the
woods
with
irish
girls
no
my
friend
let
us
find
what
the
generally
accepted
views
are
and
as
fast
as
we
find
them
set
our
heels
on
them
there
is
no
other
way
to
live
like
real
human
beings
what
on
earth
is
it
to
me
that
other
women
crawl
about
on
and
fawn
like
dogs
on
any
hand
that
will
buckle
a
collar
onto
them
and
toss
them
the
leavings
of
the
table
i
am
not
related
to
them
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
they
can
not
make
any
rules
for
me
if
pride
and
dignity
and
independence
are
dead
in
them
why
so
much
the
worse
for
them
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
certainly
it
is
no
reason
why
i
should
get
down
and
grovel
also
no
i
at
least
stand
erect
on
my
ware
sat
up
and
stared
confusedly
with
round
eyes
and
parted
lips
at
his
companion
instinctively
his
brain
dragged
forth
to
the
surface
those
epithets
which
the
doctor
had
hurled
in
bitter
contempt
at
her
mad
ass
a
mere
bundle
of
egotism
ignorance
and
the
words
rose
in
their
order
on
his
memory
hard
and
like
but
to
sit
there
quite
at
her
side
to
breathe
the
same
air
and
behold
the
calm
loveliness
of
her
profile
to
touch
the
ribbon
of
her
dress
and
all
the
while
to
hold
these
poisoned
darts
of
abuse
levelled
in
thought
at
her
breast
it
was
monstrous
he
could
have
killed
the
doctor
at
that
moment
with
an
effort
he
drove
the
foul
things
from
his
mind
scattered
them
back
into
the
darkness
he
felt
that
he
had
grown
pale
and
wondered
if
she
had
heard
the
groan
that
seemed
to
have
been
forced
from
him
in
the
struggle
or
was
the
groan
imaginary
celia
continued
to
sit
unmoved
composedly
looking
upon
vacancy
theron
eyes
searched
her
face
in
vain
for
any
sign
of
consciousness
that
she
had
astounded
and
bewildered
him
she
did
not
seem
to
be
thinking
of
him
at
all
the
proud
calm
of
her
thoughtful
countenance
suggested
instead
occupation
with
lofty
and
remote
abstractions
and
noble
ideals
contemplating
her
he
suddenly
perceived
that
what
she
had
been
saying
was
great
wonderful
magnificent
an
involuntary
thrill
ran
through
his
veins
at
recollection
of
her
words
his
fancy
likened
it
to
the
sensation
he
used
to
feel
as
a
youth
when
the
fourth
of
july
reader
bawled
forth
that
opening
clause
when
in
the
course
of
human
events
it
becomes
necessary
etc
it
was
nothing
less
than
another
declaration
of
independence
he
had
been
listening
to
he
sank
again
recumbent
at
her
side
and
stretched
the
arm
behind
her
nearer
than
before
apparently
then
you
will
never
his
voice
trembled
a
little
most
certainly
not
said
celia
you
spoke
so
feelingly
a
little
while
ago
he
ventured
along
with
hesitation
about
how
sadly
the
notion
of
a
priest
sacrificing
himself
never
knowing
what
love
meant
appealed
to
a
woman
i
should
think
that
the
idea
of
sacrificing
herself
would
seem
to
her
even
sadder
i
do
remember
that
we
mentioned
that
she
replied
how
do
you
mean
sacrificing
herself
theron
gathered
some
of
the
outlying
folds
of
her
dress
in
his
hand
and
boldly
patted
and
caressed
them
you
so
beautiful
and
so
free
with
such
fine
talents
and
abilities
he
murmured
you
who
could
have
the
whole
world
at
your
feet
are
you
too
never
going
to
know
what
love
means
do
you
call
that
no
sacrifice
to
me
it
is
the
most
terrible
that
my
imagination
can
celia
laughed
a
gentle
amused
little
laugh
in
which
theron
ears
traced
elements
of
tenderness
you
must
regulate
that
imagination
of
yours
she
said
playfully
it
conceives
the
thing
that
is
not
pray
when
and
here
turning
her
head
she
bent
down
upon
his
face
a
gaze
of
arch
pray
when
did
i
describe
myself
in
these
terms
when
did
i
say
that
i
should
never
know
what
love
meant
for
answer
theron
laid
his
head
down
upon
his
arm
and
closed
his
eyes
and
held
his
face
against
the
draperies
encircling
her
i
can
not
think
he
groaned
the
thing
that
came
uppermost
in
his
mind
as
it
swayed
and
rocked
in
the
tempest
of
emotion
was
the
strange
reminiscence
of
early
childhood
in
it
all
it
was
like
being
a
little
boy
again
nestling
in
an
innocent
unthinking
transport
of
affection
against
his
mother
skirts
the
tears
he
felt
scalding
his
eyes
were
the
spontaneous
unashamed
tears
of
a
child
the
tremulous
and
exquisite
joy
which
spread
over
him
at
once
reposeful
and
yearning
was
full
of
infantile
purity
and
sweetness
he
had
not
comprehended
at
all
before
what
wellsprings
of
spiritual
beauty
what
limpid
depths
of
idealism
his
nature
contained
we
were
speaking
of
our
respective
religions
he
heard
celia
say
as
imperturbably
as
if
there
had
been
no
digression
worth
mentioning
yes
he
assented
and
moved
his
head
so
that
he
looked
up
at
her
back
hair
and
the
leaves
high
above
mottled
against
the
sky
the
wish
to
lie
there
where
now
he
could
just
catch
the
line
of
her
as
well
was
very
strong
upon
him
yes
he
repeated
i
can
not
talk
to
you
like
that
she
said
and
he
sat
up
again
shamefacedly
yes
i
think
we
were
speaking
of
religions
some
time
ago
he
faltered
to
relieve
the
situation
the
dreadful
thought
that
she
might
be
annoyed
began
to
oppress
him
well
you
said
whatever
my
religion
was
it
was
yours
too
that
entitles
you
at
least
to
be
told
what
the
religion
is
now
i
am
a
theron
much
mystified
nodded
his
head
could
it
be
possible
was
there
coming
a
deliberate
suggestion
that
he
should
become
a
convert
yes
i
know
he
murmured
but
i
should
explain
that
i
am
only
a
catholic
in
the
sense
that
its
symbolism
is
pleasant
to
me
you
remember
what
schopenhauer
said
you
can
not
have
the
water
by
itself
you
must
also
have
the
jug
that
it
is
in
very
well
the
catholic
religion
is
my
jug
i
put
into
it
the
things
i
like
they
were
all
there
long
ago
thousands
of
years
ago
the
jews
threw
them
out
we
will
put
them
back
again
we
will
restore
art
and
poetry
and
the
love
of
beauty
and
the
gentle
spiritual
soulful
life
the
greeks
had
it
and
christianity
would
have
had
it
too
if
it
been
for
those
brutes
they
call
the
fathers
they
loved
ugliness
and
dirt
and
the
thought
of
they
hated
women
in
all
the
earlier
stages
of
the
church
women
were
very
prominent
in
it
jesus
himself
appreciated
women
and
delighted
to
have
them
about
him
and
talk
with
them
and
listen
to
them
that
was
the
very
essence
of
the
greek
spirit
and
it
breathed
into
christianity
at
its
birth
a
sweetness
and
a
grace
which
twenty
generations
of
cranks
and
savages
like
paul
and
jerome
and
tertullian
were
able
to
extinguish
but
the
very
man
cyril
who
killed
hypatia
and
thus
began
the
dark
ages
unwittingly
did
another
thing
which
makes
one
almost
forgive
him
to
please
the
egyptians
he
secured
the
church
acceptance
of
the
adoration
of
the
virgin
it
is
that
idea
which
has
kept
the
greek
spirit
alive
and
grown
and
grown
till
at
last
it
will
rule
the
world
it
was
only
epileptic
jews
who
could
imagine
a
religion
without
sex
in
i
remember
the
pictures
of
the
virgin
in
your
room
said
theron
feeling
more
himself
again
i
wondered
if
they
quite
went
with
the
the
remark
won
a
smile
from
celia
lips
they
get
along
together
better
than
you
suppose
she
answered
besides
they
are
not
all
pictures
of
mary
one
of
them
standing
on
the
moon
is
of
isis
with
the
infant
horus
in
her
arms
another
might
as
well
be
mahamie
bearing
the
miraculously
born
buddha
or
olympias
with
her
child
alexander
or
even
perictione
holding
her
babe
plato
all
these
were
similar
cases
you
know
almost
every
religion
had
its
immaculate
conception
what
does
it
all
come
to
except
to
show
us
that
man
turns
naturally
toward
the
worship
of
the
maternal
idea
that
is
the
deepest
of
all
our
instincts
love
of
woman
who
is
at
once
daughter
and
wife
and
mother
it
is
that
that
makes
the
world
go
brave
thoughts
shaped
themselves
in
theron
mind
and
shone
forth
in
a
confident
yet
wistful
smile
on
his
face
it
is
a
pity
you
can
not
change
estates
with
me
for
one
minute
he
said
in
steady
low
tone
then
you
would
realize
the
tremendous
truth
of
what
you
have
been
saying
it
is
only
your
intellect
that
has
reached
out
and
grasped
the
idea
if
you
were
in
my
place
you
would
discover
that
your
heart
was
bursting
with
it
as
celia
turned
and
looked
at
him
i
myself
he
went
on
would
not
have
known
half
an
hour
ago
what
you
meant
by
the
worship
of
the
maternal
idea
i
am
much
older
than
you
i
am
a
strong
mature
man
but
when
i
lay
down
there
and
shut
my
eyes
because
the
charm
and
marvel
of
this
whole
experience
had
for
the
moment
overcome
me
the
strangest
sensation
seized
upon
me
it
was
absolutely
as
if
i
were
a
boy
again
a
good
fond
little
child
and
you
were
the
mother
that
i
celia
had
not
taken
her
eyes
from
his
face
i
find
myself
liking
you
better
at
this
moment
she
said
with
gravity
than
i
have
ever
liked
you
then
as
by
a
sudden
impulse
she
sprang
to
her
feet
come
she
cried
her
voice
and
manner
all
vivacity
once
more
we
have
been
here
long
upon
the
instant
as
theron
was
more
laboriously
getting
up
it
became
apparent
to
them
both
that
perhaps
they
had
been
there
too
long
a
boy
with
a
gun
under
his
arm
and
two
gray
squirrels
tied
by
the
tails
slung
across
his
shoulder
stood
at
the
entrance
to
the
glade
some
dozen
paces
away
regarding
them
with
undisguised
interest
upon
the
discovery
that
he
was
in
turn
observed
he
resumed
his
interrupted
progress
through
the
woods
whistling
softly
as
he
went
and
vanished
among
the
trees
heavens
above
groaned
theron
shudderingly
know
him
he
went
on
in
answer
to
the
glance
of
inquiry
on
his
companion
face
i
should
think
i
did
he
spades
my
my
wife
garden
for
her
he
used
to
bring
our
milk
he
works
in
the
law
office
of
one
of
my
trustees
the
one
who
is
friendly
to
me
but
is
very
friendly
indeed
with
my
with
ware
oh
what
shall
i
do
it
may
easily
mean
my
ruin
celia
looked
at
him
attentively
the
color
had
gone
out
of
his
face
and
with
it
the
effect
of
earnestness
and
mental
elevation
which
a
minute
before
had
caught
her
fancy
somehow
i
fear
that
i
do
not
like
you
quite
so
much
just
now
my
friend
she
remarked
in
god
name
do
say
that
urged
theron
he
raised
his
voice
in
agitated
entreaty
you
do
know
what
these
people
are
how
they
would
leap
at
the
barest
hint
of
a
scandal
about
me
in
my
position
i
am
a
thousand
times
more
defenceless
than
any
woman
just
a
single
whisper
and
i
am
done
for
let
me
point
out
to
you
ware
said
celia
slowly
that
to
be
seen
sitting
and
talking
with
me
whatever
doubts
it
may
raise
as
to
a
gentleman
intellectual
condition
need
not
necessarily
blast
his
social
reputation
beyond
all
hope
theron
stared
at
her
as
if
he
had
not
grasped
her
meaning
then
he
winced
visibly
under
it
and
put
out
his
hands
to
implore
her
forgive
me
forgive
me
he
pleaded
i
was
beside
myself
for
the
moment
with
the
fright
of
the
thing
oh
say
you
do
forgive
me
celia
he
made
haste
to
support
this
daring
use
of
her
name
i
have
been
so
happy
today
so
deeply
so
vastly
happy
like
the
little
child
i
spoke
of
and
that
is
so
new
in
my
lonely
life
that
the
suddenness
of
the
thing
it
just
for
the
instant
unstrung
me
do
be
too
hard
on
me
for
it
and
i
had
hoped
too
i
had
had
such
genuine
heartfelt
pleasure
in
the
thought
that
an
hour
or
two
ago
when
you
were
unhappy
perhaps
it
had
been
some
sort
of
consolation
to
you
that
i
was
with
celia
was
looking
away
when
he
took
her
hand
she
did
not
withdraw
it
but
turned
and
nodded
in
musing
general
assent
to
what
he
had
said
yes
we
have
both
been
unstrung
as
you
call
it
today
she
said
decidedly
out
of
pitch
let
each
forgive
the
other
and
say
no
more
about
she
took
his
arm
and
they
retraced
their
steps
along
the
path
again
in
silence
the
labored
noise
of
the
orchestra
as
it
were
returned
to
meet
them
they
halted
at
an
intersecting
footpath
i
go
back
to
my
slavery
my
double
bondage
said
theron
letting
his
voice
sink
to
a
sigh
but
even
if
i
am
put
on
the
rack
for
it
i
shall
have
had
one
day
of
i
think
you
may
kiss
me
in
memory
of
that
one
day
or
of
a
few
minutes
in
that
day
said
celia
their
lips
brushed
each
other
in
a
swift
almost
perfunctory
caress
theron
went
his
way
at
a
hurried
pace
the
sobered
tones
of
her
beating
upon
his
brain
with
every
measure
of
the
droning
part
iv
chapter
xxv
the
memory
of
the
kiss
abode
with
theron
like
aaron
rod
it
swallowed
up
one
by
one
all
competing
thoughts
and
recollections
and
made
his
brain
its
slave
even
as
he
strode
back
through
the
woods
to
the
it
was
the
kiss
that
kept
his
feet
in
motion
and
guided
their
automatic
course
all
along
the
watches
of
the
restless
night
it
was
the
kiss
that
bore
him
sweet
company
and
wandered
with
him
from
one
broken
dream
of
bliss
to
another
next
day
it
was
the
kiss
that
made
of
life
for
him
a
sort
of
sunlit
wonderland
he
preached
his
sermon
in
the
morning
and
took
his
appointed
part
in
the
other
services
of
afternoon
and
evening
apparently
to
everybody
satisfaction
to
him
it
was
all
a
vision
when
the
beautiful
full
moon
rose
this
sunday
evening
and
glorified
the
clearing
and
the
forest
with
its
mellow
harvest
radiance
he
could
have
groaned
with
the
burden
of
his
joy
he
went
out
alone
into
the
light
and
bared
his
head
to
it
and
stood
motionless
for
a
long
time
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
been
impelled
as
powerfully
toward
earnest
and
soulful
thanksgiving
the
impulse
to
kneel
there
in
the
pure
tender
moonlight
and
lift
up
offerings
of
praise
to
god
kept
uppermost
in
his
mind
some
formless
resignation
restrained
him
from
the
act
itself
but
the
spirit
of
it
hallowed
his
mood
he
gazed
up
at
the
broad
luminous
face
of
the
satellite
you
are
our
god
he
murmured
hers
and
mine
you
are
the
most
beautiful
of
heavenly
creatures
as
she
is
of
the
angels
on
earth
i
am
speechless
with
reverence
for
you
it
was
not
until
the
broke
up
four
days
later
and
theron
with
the
rest
returned
to
town
that
the
material
aspects
of
what
had
happened
and
might
be
expected
to
happen
forced
themselves
upon
his
mind
the
kiss
was
a
child
of
the
forest
so
long
as
theron
remained
in
the
camp
the
image
of
the
kiss
which
was
enshrined
in
his
heart
and
ministered
to
by
all
his
thoughts
continued
enveloped
in
a
haze
of
sylvan
mystery
like
a
dryad
suggestions
of
its
beauty
and
holiness
came
to
him
in
the
odors
of
the
woodland
at
the
sight
of
wild
flowers
and
when
he
walked
alone
in
unfamiliar
parts
of
the
forest
he
carried
about
with
him
the
idea
of
somewhere
coming
upon
a
strange
hidden
pool
which
mortal
eye
had
not
seen
before
a
deep
sequestered
mere
of
waters
walled
in
by
rich
tangled
growths
of
verdure
and
bearing
upon
its
virgin
bosom
only
the
shadows
of
the
primeval
wilderness
and
the
light
of
the
eternal
skies
his
fancy
dwelt
upon
some
such
nook
as
the
enchanted
home
of
the
fairy
that
possessed
his
soul
the
place
though
he
never
found
it
became
real
to
him
as
he
pictured
it
there
rose
sometimes
from
among
the
stirring
the
translucent
depths
and
fluttering
over
the
water
surface
drops
like
gems
the
wonderful
form
of
a
woman
with
pale
leaves
wreathed
in
her
luxuriant
red
hair
and
a
skin
which
gave
forth
light
with
the
homecoming
to
octavius
his
dreams
began
to
take
more
account
of
realities
in
a
day
or
two
he
was
wide
awake
and
thinking
hard
the
kiss
was
as
much
as
ever
the
ceaseless
companion
of
his
hours
but
it
no
longer
insisted
upon
shrouding
itself
in
vines
and
woodland
creepers
or
outlining
itself
in
phosphorescent
vagueness
against
mystic
backgrounds
of
glades
it
advanced
out
into
the
noonday
and
assumed
tangible
dimensions
and
substance
he
saw
that
it
was
related
to
the
facts
of
his
daily
life
and
had
in
turn
altered
his
own
relations
to
all
these
facts
what
ought
he
to
do
what
could
he
do
apparently
nothing
but
wait
he
waited
for
a
week
then
for
another
week
the
conclusion
that
the
initiative
had
been
left
to
him
began
to
take
shape
in
his
mind
from
this
it
seemed
but
a
step
to
the
passionate
resolve
to
act
at
once
turning
the
situation
over
and
over
in
his
anxious
thoughts
two
things
stood
out
in
special
prominence
one
was
that
celia
loved
him
the
other
was
that
the
boy
in
gorringe
law
office
and
possibly
gorringe
and
heaven
only
knew
how
many
others
besides
had
reasons
for
suspecting
this
to
be
true
and
what
about
celia
side
by
side
with
the
moving
rapture
of
thinking
about
her
as
a
woman
there
rose
the
substantial
satisfaction
of
contemplating
her
as
miss
madden
she
had
kissed
him
and
she
was
very
rich
the
things
gradually
linked
themselves
before
his
eyes
he
tried
a
thousand
varying
guesses
at
what
she
proposed
to
do
and
each
time
reined
up
his
imagination
by
the
reminder
that
she
was
confessedly
a
creature
of
whims
who
proposed
to
do
nothing
but
was
capable
of
all
things
and
as
to
the
boy
if
he
had
blabbed
what
he
saw
it
was
incredible
that
somebody
should
not
take
the
subject
up
and
impart
a
scandalous
twist
to
it
and
send
it
rolling
like
a
snowball
to
gather
up
exaggeration
and
foul
innuendo
till
it
was
big
enough
to
overwhelm
him
what
would
happen
to
him
if
a
formal
charge
were
preferred
against
him
he
looked
it
up
in
the
discipline
of
course
if
his
accusers
magnified
their
mean
suspicions
and
calumnious
imaginings
to
the
point
of
formulating
a
charge
it
would
be
one
of
immorality
they
could
prove
nothing
there
was
nothing
to
prove
at
the
worst
it
was
an
indiscretion
which
would
involve
his
being
admonished
by
his
presiding
elder
or
if
these
narrow
bigots
confused
slanders
with
proofs
and
showed
that
they
intended
to
convict
him
then
it
would
be
open
to
him
to
withdraw
from
the
ministry
in
advance
of
his
condemnation
his
relation
to
the
church
would
be
the
same
as
if
he
had
been
expelled
but
to
the
outer
world
it
would
be
different
and
supposing
he
did
withdraw
from
the
ministry
yes
this
was
the
important
point
what
if
he
did
abandon
this
mistaken
profession
of
his
on
its
mental
side
the
relief
would
be
prodigious
unthinkable
but
on
the
practical
side
the
side
for
some
days
theron
paused
with
a
shudder
when
he
reached
this
question
the
thought
of
the
plunge
into
unknown
material
responsibilities
gave
him
a
sinking
heart
he
tried
to
imagine
himself
lecturing
canvassing
for
books
or
insurance
policies
writing
for
newspapers
and
remained
frightened
but
suddenly
one
day
it
occurred
to
him
that
these
qualms
and
forebodings
were
sheer
folly
was
not
celia
rich
would
she
not
with
lightning
swiftness
draw
forth
that
like
the
flashing
sword
of
a
champion
from
its
scabbard
and
run
to
his
relief
why
of
course
it
was
absurd
not
to
have
thought
of
that
before
he
recalled
her
momentary
anger
with
him
that
afternoon
in
the
woods
when
he
had
cried
out
that
discovery
would
mean
ruin
to
him
he
saw
clearly
enough
now
that
she
had
been
grieved
at
his
want
of
faith
in
her
protection
in
his
flurry
of
fright
he
had
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
if
exposure
and
trouble
came
to
him
she
would
naturally
feel
that
she
had
been
the
cause
of
his
martyrdom
it
was
plain
enough
now
if
he
got
into
hot
water
it
would
be
solely
on
account
of
his
having
been
seen
with
her
he
had
walked
into
the
woods
with
her
the
further
the
better
had
been
her
own
words
out
of
pure
kindliness
and
the
desire
to
lead
her
away
from
the
scene
of
her
brother
and
her
own
humiliation
but
why
amplify
arguments
her
own
warm
heart
would
tell
her
on
the
instant
how
he
had
been
sacrificed
for
her
sake
and
would
bring
her
eager
and
devoted
to
his
succor
that
was
all
right
then
slowly
from
this
point
suggestions
expanded
themselves
the
future
could
be
if
he
willed
it
one
long
serene
triumph
of
love
and
lofty
intellectual
companionship
and
existence
softened
and
enriched
at
every
point
by
all
that
wealth
could
command
and
the
most
exquisite
tastes
suggest
should
he
will
it
ah
the
question
answered
itself
but
he
could
not
enter
upon
this
beckoning
heaven
of
a
future
until
he
had
freed
himself
when
celia
said
to
him
come
he
must
not
be
in
the
position
to
reply
i
should
like
to
but
unfortunately
i
am
tied
by
the
he
should
have
to
leave
octavius
leave
the
ministry
leave
everything
he
could
not
begin
too
soon
to
face
these
contingencies
very
likely
celia
had
not
thought
it
out
as
far
as
this
with
her
it
was
a
mere
vague
sometime
i
but
the
harder
masculine
sense
theron
felt
existed
for
the
very
purpose
of
correcting
and
giving
point
to
these
loose
feminine
notions
of
time
and
space
it
was
for
him
to
clear
away
the
obstacles
and
map
the
plans
out
with
definite
decision
one
warm
afternoon
as
he
lolled
in
his
under
the
open
window
of
his
study
musing
upon
the
phases
of
this
vast
complicated
urgent
problem
some
chance
words
from
the
sidewalk
in
front
came
to
his
ears
and
coming
remained
to
clarify
his
thoughts
two
ladies
whose
voices
were
strange
to
him
had
stopped
as
so
many
people
almost
daily
stopped
to
admire
the
garden
of
the
parsonage
one
of
them
expressed
her
pleasure
in
general
terms
said
the
other
my
husband
declares
those
dahlias
alone
could
be
matched
for
thirty
dollars
and
that
some
of
those
gladiolus
must
have
cost
three
or
four
dollars
apiece
i
know
we
spent
simply
oceans
of
money
on
our
garden
and
it
does
begin
to
compare
with
it
seems
like
a
sinful
waste
to
me
said
her
companion
the
other
hesitated
no
i
do
think
quite
that
if
you
can
afford
it
just
as
well
as
not
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
i
rather
live
in
a
little
better
house
and
not
spend
it
all
on
flowers
just
look
at
that
cactus
the
voices
died
away
theron
sat
up
with
a
look
of
arrested
thought
upon
his
face
then
sprang
to
his
feet
and
moved
hurriedly
through
the
parlor
to
an
open
front
window
peering
out
with
caution
he
saw
that
the
two
women
receding
from
view
were
fashionably
dressed
and
evidently
came
from
homes
of
means
he
stared
after
them
in
a
blank
way
until
they
turned
a
corner
he
went
into
the
hall
then
put
on
his
and
hat
and
stepped
out
into
the
garden
he
was
conscious
of
having
rather
avoided
it
heretofore
not
altogether
without
reasons
of
his
own
lying
unexamined
somewhere
in
the
recesses
of
his
mind
now
he
walked
slowly
about
and
examined
the
flowers
with
great
attentiveness
the
season
was
advancing
and
he
saw
that
many
plants
had
gone
out
of
bloom
but
what
a
magnificent
plenitude
of
blossoms
still
remained
thirty
dollars
worth
of
dahlias
that
was
what
the
stranger
had
said
theron
hardly
brought
himself
to
credit
the
statement
but
all
the
same
it
was
apparent
to
even
his
uninformed
eye
that
these
huge
imbricated
flowering
masses
with
their
extraordinary
must
be
unusual
he
remembered
that
the
boy
in
gorringe
office
had
spoken
of
just
one
lot
of
plants
costing
dollars
and
sixty
cents
and
there
had
been
two
other
lots
as
well
the
figures
remained
surprisingly
distinct
in
his
memory
it
was
no
good
deceiving
himself
any
longer
of
course
these
were
the
plants
that
gorringe
had
spent
his
money
upon
here
all
about
him
as
he
surveyed
them
with
a
sour
regard
a
cool
breeze
stirred
across
the
garden
the
tall
of
gladioli
bent
and
nodded
at
him
the
hollyhocks
and
flaming
alvias
the
clustered
blossoms
on
the
standard
roses
the
delicately
painted
lilies
on
their
stems
fluttered
in
the
wind
and
seemed
all
bowing
satirically
to
him
yes
levi
gorringe
paid
for
us
he
almost
heard
their
mocking
declaration
out
in
the
where
a
longer
day
of
sunshine
dwelt
there
were
many
other
flowers
and
notably
a
bed
of
geraniums
which
literally
made
the
eye
ache
standing
at
this
rear
corner
of
the
house
he
caught
the
droning
sound
of
alice
voice
humming
a
hymn
to
herself
as
she
went
about
her
kitchen
work
he
saw
her
through
the
open
window
she
was
sweeping
and
had
a
sort
of
cap
on
her
head
which
did
not
add
to
the
graces
of
her
appearance
he
looked
at
her
with
a
hard
glance
recalling
as
a
fresh
grievance
the
ten
days
of
intolerable
boredom
he
had
spent
cooped
up
in
a
ridiculous
little
tent
with
her
at
the
she
must
have
realized
at
the
time
how
odious
the
enforced
companionship
was
to
him
yes
beyond
doubt
she
did
it
came
back
to
him
now
that
they
had
spoken
but
rarely
to
each
other
she
had
not
even
praised
his
sermon
upon
the
which
every
one
else
had
been
in
raptures
over
for
that
matter
she
no
longer
praised
anything
he
did
and
took
obvious
pains
to
preserve
toward
him
a
distant
demeanor
so
much
the
better
he
felt
himself
thinking
if
she
chose
to
behave
in
that
offish
and
unwifely
fashion
she
could
blame
no
one
but
herself
for
its
results
she
had
seen
him
and
came
now
to
the
window
and
broom
in
hand
she
put
her
head
out
to
breathe
a
breath
of
dustless
air
and
began
as
if
she
would
smile
on
him
then
her
face
chilled
and
stiffened
as
she
caught
his
look
shall
you
be
home
for
supper
she
asked
in
her
iciest
tone
he
had
not
thought
of
going
out
before
the
question
and
the
manner
of
it
gave
immediate
urgency
to
the
idea
of
going
somewhere
i
may
or
i
may
not
he
replied
it
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
he
turned
on
his
heel
with
this
and
walked
briskly
out
of
the
yard
and
down
the
street
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
that
presently
he
should
be
strolling
past
the
madden
house
and
letting
a
covert
glance
stray
over
its
front
and
the
grounds
about
it
as
he
loitered
along
every
day
since
his
return
from
the
woods
he
had
given
the
fates
this
chance
of
bringing
celia
to
meet
him
without
avail
he
had
hung
about
in
the
vicinity
of
the
catholic
church
on
several
evenings
as
well
but
to
no
purpose
the
organ
inside
was
dumb
and
he
could
detect
no
signs
of
celia
presence
on
the
curtains
of
the
pastorate
next
door
this
day
too
there
was
no
one
visible
at
the
home
of
the
maddens
and
he
walked
on
a
little
sadly
it
was
weary
work
waiting
for
the
signal
that
never
came
but
there
were
compensations
his
mind
reverted
doggedly
to
the
flowers
in
his
garden
and
to
alice
behavior
toward
him
they
insisted
upon
connecting
themselves
in
his
thoughts
why
should
levi
gorringe
a
and
therefore
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
incur
reckless
expenditure
go
and
buy
perhaps
a
hundred
dollars
worth
of
flowers
for
his
wife
garden
it
was
time
high
time
to
face
this
question
and
his
experiencing
religion
afterward
just
when
alice
did
and
marching
down
to
the
rail
to
kneel
beside
her
that
was
a
thing
to
be
thought
of
too
meditation
it
is
true
hardly
threw
fresh
light
upon
the
matter
it
was
incredible
of
course
that
there
should
be
anything
wrong
to
even
shape
a
thought
of
alice
in
connection
with
gallantry
would
be
wholly
impossible
nor
could
it
be
said
that
gorringe
in
his
new
capacity
as
a
professing
had
disclosed
any
sign
of
ulterior
motives
or
of
insincerity
yet
there
the
facts
were
while
theron
pondered
them
their
mystery
if
they
involved
a
mystery
baffled
him
altogether
but
when
he
had
finished
he
found
himself
all
the
same
convinced
that
neither
alice
nor
gorringe
would
be
free
to
blame
him
for
anything
he
might
do
he
had
grounds
for
complaint
against
them
if
he
did
not
himself
know
just
what
these
grounds
were
it
was
certain
enough
that
they
knew
very
well
then
let
them
take
the
responsibility
for
what
happened
it
was
indeed
awkward
that
at
the
moment
as
theron
chanced
to
emerge
temporarily
from
his
his
eyes
fell
full
upon
the
spare
form
of
levi
gorringe
himself
standing
only
a
few
feet
away
in
the
staircase
entrance
to
his
law
office
his
lean
face
browned
by
the
summer
exposure
had
a
more
arabian
aspect
than
ever
his
hands
were
in
his
pockets
and
he
held
an
unlighted
cigar
between
his
teeth
he
looked
the
rev
ware
over
calmly
and
nodded
recognition
theron
had
halted
instinctively
on
the
instant
he
would
have
given
a
great
deal
not
to
have
stopped
at
all
it
was
stupid
of
him
to
have
paused
but
it
would
not
do
now
to
go
on
without
words
of
some
sort
he
moved
over
to
the
and
made
a
pretence
of
looking
at
the
photographs
in
one
of
the
at
its
side
as
gorringe
did
not
take
his
hands
from
his
pockets
there
was
no
occasion
for
any
formal
greeting
i
had
no
idea
that
they
took
such
good
pictures
in
octavius
theron
remarked
after
a
minute
silence
still
bending
in
examination
of
the
photographs
they
ought
to
they
charge
new
york
prices
observed
the
lawyer
sententiously
theron
found
in
the
words
confirmation
of
his
feeling
that
gorringe
was
not
naturally
a
lavish
or
extravagant
man
rather
was
he
a
careful
and
calculating
man
who
spent
money
only
for
a
purpose
though
the
minister
continued
gazing
at
the
stiff
presentments
of
local
beauties
and
swains
his
eyes
seemed
to
see
hollyhocks
and
spotted
lilies
instead
suddenly
a
resolve
came
to
him
he
stood
erect
and
faced
his
trustee
speaking
of
the
price
of
things
he
said
with
an
effort
of
arrogance
in
his
measured
tone
i
have
never
had
an
opportunity
before
of
mentioning
the
subject
of
the
flowers
you
have
so
kindly
furnished
for
my
for
my
why
mention
it
now
queried
gorringe
with
nonchalance
he
turned
his
cigar
about
with
a
movement
of
his
lips
and
worked
it
into
the
corner
of
his
mouth
he
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
look
at
theron
at
all
because
began
ware
and
then
hesitated
because
well
it
raises
a
question
of
my
being
under
obligation
which
i
oh
no
sir
said
the
lawyer
put
that
out
of
your
mind
you
are
no
more
under
obligation
to
me
than
i
am
to
you
oh
no
make
yourself
easy
about
that
neither
of
us
owes
the
other
not
even
i
take
that
to
be
your
meaning
retorted
theron
with
some
heat
the
words
are
yours
sir
responded
gorringe
coolly
i
do
not
object
to
as
you
like
put
in
the
other
if
it
be
so
why
then
all
the
more
reason
why
i
should
under
the
circumstances
under
what
circumstances
interposed
the
lawyer
let
us
be
clear
about
this
thing
as
we
go
along
to
what
circumstances
do
you
refer
he
had
turned
his
eyes
now
and
looked
theron
in
the
face
a
slight
protrusion
of
his
lower
jaw
had
given
the
cigar
an
upward
tilt
under
the
black
mustache
the
circumstances
are
that
you
have
brought
or
sent
to
my
garden
a
great
many
very
expensive
and
bushes
and
so
and
you
object
i
had
not
supposed
that
clergymen
in
general
and
you
in
particular
were
so
sensitive
have
donation
parties
then
gone
out
of
date
i
understand
your
sneer
well
enough
retorted
theron
but
that
can
pass
the
main
point
is
that
you
did
me
the
honor
to
send
these
plants
or
to
smuggle
them
in
but
never
once
deigned
to
hint
to
me
that
you
had
done
so
no
one
told
me
except
by
mere
accident
i
should
not
have
known
to
this
day
where
they
came
gorringe
twisted
the
cigar
at
another
angle
with
lines
of
grim
amusement
about
the
corner
of
his
mouth
i
should
have
thought
he
said
with
dry
deliberation
that
possibly
this
fact
might
have
raised
in
your
mind
the
conceivable
hypothesis
that
the
plants
might
not
be
intended
for
you
at
that
is
precisely
it
sir
said
theron
there
were
people
passing
and
he
was
forced
to
keep
his
voice
down
it
would
have
been
a
relief
he
felt
to
shout
that
is
it
they
were
not
intended
for
well
then
what
are
you
talking
about
the
lawyer
speech
had
become
abrupt
almost
to
incivility
i
think
my
remarks
have
been
perfectly
clear
said
the
minister
with
dignity
it
was
a
new
experience
to
be
addressed
in
that
fashion
it
occurred
to
him
to
add
please
remember
that
i
am
not
in
the
to
be
bullied
or
insulted
by
a
gorringe
studied
theron
face
attentively
with
a
cold
searching
scrutiny
you
may
thank
your
stars
you
not
he
said
with
significance
what
on
earth
could
he
mean
the
words
and
the
menacing
tone
greatly
impressed
theron
indeed
upon
reflection
he
found
that
they
frightened
him
the
disposition
to
adopt
a
high
tone
with
the
lawyer
was
melting
away
i
do
not
see
he
began
and
then
deliberately
allowed
his
voice
to
take
on
an
injured
and
plaintive
inflection
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
adopt
this
tone
toward
me
brother
the
lawyer
scowled
and
bit
sharply
into
the
cigar
but
said
nothing
if
i
have
unconsciously
offended
you
in
any
way
theron
went
on
i
beg
you
to
tell
me
how
i
liked
you
from
the
beginning
of
my
pastorate
here
and
the
thought
that
latterly
we
seemed
to
be
drifting
apart
has
given
me
much
pain
but
now
it
is
still
more
distressing
to
find
you
actually
disposed
to
quarrel
with
me
surely
brother
gorringe
between
a
pastor
and
a
probationer
who
no
gorringe
broke
in
quarrel
is
the
word
for
it
there
is
any
quarrel
he
stepped
down
from
the
to
the
sidewalk
as
he
spoke
and
stood
face
to
face
with
theron
with
and
factory
girls
were
passing
close
to
them
and
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
sharp
incisive
as
he
added
it
would
be
worth
any
grown
man
while
to
quarrel
with
so
poor
a
creature
as
you
theron
stood
confounded
with
an
empty
stare
of
bewilderment
on
his
face
it
rose
in
his
mind
that
the
right
thing
to
feel
was
rage
righteous
indignation
fury
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
muster
any
manly
anger
the
character
of
the
insult
stupefied
him
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
anything
to
say
to
you
in
reply
he
remarked
after
what
seemed
to
him
a
silence
of
minutes
his
lips
framed
the
words
automatically
but
they
expressed
well
enough
the
blank
vacancy
of
his
mind
the
suggestion
that
anybody
deemed
him
a
poor
creature
grew
more
astounding
incomprehensible
as
it
swelled
in
his
brain
no
i
suppose
not
snapped
gorringe
you
not
the
sort
to
stand
up
to
men
your
form
is
to
go
round
the
corner
and
take
it
out
of
somebody
weaker
than
yourself
a
defenceless
woman
for
oh
ho
said
theron
the
exclamation
had
uttered
itself
the
sound
of
it
seemed
to
clarify
his
muddled
thoughts
and
as
they
ranged
themselves
in
order
he
began
to
understand
oh
ho
he
said
again
and
nodded
his
head
in
token
of
comprehension
the
lawyer
chewing
his
cigar
with
increased
activity
glared
at
him
what
do
you
mean
he
demanded
peremptorily
mean
said
the
minister
oh
nothing
that
i
feel
called
upon
to
explain
to
it
was
passing
strange
but
his
had
all
at
once
returned
to
him
as
it
became
more
apparent
that
the
lawyer
was
losing
his
temper
theron
found
the
courage
to
turn
up
the
corners
of
his
lips
in
show
of
a
bitter
little
smile
of
confidence
he
looked
into
the
dusky
face
and
flaunted
this
smile
at
it
in
contemptuous
defiance
it
is
not
a
subject
that
i
can
discuss
with
propriety
at
this
stage
he
added
damn
you
are
you
talking
about
those
flowers
oh
i
am
not
talking
about
anything
in
particular
returned
theron
not
even
the
curious
choice
of
language
which
my
latest
probationer
seems
to
go
and
strike
my
name
off
the
list
said
gorringe
with
rising
passion
i
was
a
fool
to
ever
have
it
there
to
think
of
being
a
probationer
of
yours
my
god
that
will
be
a
pity
from
one
point
of
view
remarked
theron
still
with
the
ironical
smile
on
his
lips
you
seemed
to
enter
upon
the
new
life
with
such
deliberation
and
fixity
of
purpose
too
i
can
imagine
the
regrets
your
withdrawal
will
cause
in
certain
quarters
i
only
hope
that
it
will
not
discourage
those
who
accompanied
you
to
the
altar
and
shared
your
enthusiasm
at
the
he
had
spoken
throughout
with
studied
slowness
and
an
insolent
nicety
of
utterance
you
had
better
go
away
broke
forth
gorringe
if
you
do
i
shall
forget
for
the
first
time
asked
theron
then
warned
by
the
flash
in
the
lawyer
eye
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
sauntered
with
a
painstaking
assumption
of
a
mind
quite
at
ease
up
the
street
gorringe
own
face
twitched
and
his
veins
tingled
as
he
looked
after
him
he
spat
the
shapeless
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
into
the
gutter
and
drawing
forth
another
from
his
pocket
clenched
it
between
his
teeth
his
gaze
following
the
tall
form
of
the
methodist
minister
till
it
was
merged
in
the
crowd
well
i
damned
he
said
aloud
to
himself
the
photographer
had
come
down
to
take
in
his
showcases
for
the
night
he
looked
up
from
his
task
at
the
exclamation
and
grinned
inquiringly
i
just
been
talking
to
a
man
said
the
lawyer
who
so
much
meaner
than
any
other
man
i
ever
heard
of
that
it
takes
my
breath
away
he
got
a
wife
that
as
pure
and
good
as
gold
and
he
knows
it
and
she
worships
the
ground
he
walks
on
and
he
knows
that
too
and
yet
the
scoundrel
is
around
trying
to
sniff
out
some
shadow
of
a
pretext
for
misusing
her
worse
than
he
already
done
yes
sir
he
be
actually
tickled
to
death
if
he
could
nose
up
some
hint
of
a
scandal
about
her
something
that
he
could
pretend
to
believe
and
work
for
his
own
advantage
to
levy
blackmail
or
get
rid
of
her
or
whatever
suited
his
book
i
did
think
there
was
such
an
cur
on
this
whole
footstool
i
almost
wish
by
god
i
thrown
him
into
the
canal
yes
you
lawyers
must
run
against
some
pretty
snide
specimens
remarked
the
photographer
lifting
one
of
the
cases
from
its
sockets
chapter
xxvi
theron
spent
half
an
hour
in
aimless
strolling
about
the
streets
from
earliest
boyhood
his
mind
had
always
worked
most
clearly
when
he
walked
alone
every
mental
process
which
had
left
a
mark
upon
his
memory
and
his
career
the
daydreams
of
future
academic
greatness
and
fame
which
had
fashioned
themselves
in
his
brain
as
a
farm
lad
the
meditations
raptures
and
high
resolves
of
his
student
period
at
the
seminary
the
more
notable
sermons
and
powerful
discourse
by
which
he
had
revealed
the
genius
that
was
in
him
to
astonished
and
delighted
assemblages
all
were
associated
in
his
retrospective
thoughts
with
solitary
rambles
he
had
a
very
direct
and
vivid
consciousness
now
that
it
was
good
to
be
on
his
legs
and
alone
he
had
never
in
his
life
been
more
sensible
of
the
charm
of
his
own
companionship
the
encounter
with
gorringe
seemed
to
have
cleared
all
the
clouds
out
of
his
brain
and
restored
lightness
to
his
heart
after
such
an
object
lesson
the
impossibility
of
his
continuing
to
sacrifice
himself
to
a
notion
of
duty
to
these
and
villagers
was
beyond
all
argument
there
could
no
longer
be
any
doubt
about
his
moral
right
to
turn
his
back
upon
them
to
wash
his
hands
of
the
miserable
combination
of
hypocrisy
and
hysterics
which
they
called
their
spiritual
life
and
the
question
of
gorringe
and
alice
that
too
stood
precisely
where
he
wanted
it
even
in
his
own
thoughts
he
preferred
to
pursue
it
no
further
between
them
somewhere
an
offence
of
concealment
it
might
be
of
conspiracy
had
been
committed
against
him
it
was
no
business
of
his
to
say
more
or
to
think
more
he
rested
his
case
simply
on
the
fact
which
could
not
be
denied
and
which
he
was
not
in
the
least
interested
to
have
explained
one
way
or
the
other
the
recollection
of
obvious
disturbance
of
mind
was
especially
pleasant
to
him
he
himself
had
been
magnanimous
almost
to
the
point
of
weakness
he
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
call
the
man
brother
and
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
behaving
like
a
gentleman
but
his
kindly
forbearance
had
been
wasted
gorringe
was
not
the
man
to
understand
generous
feelings
much
less
rise
to
their
level
he
had
merely
shown
that
he
would
be
vicious
if
he
knew
how
it
was
more
important
and
satisfactory
to
recall
that
he
had
also
shown
a
complete
comprehension
of
the
injured
husband
grievance
the
fact
that
he
had
recognized
it
was
enough
was
in
fact
everything
in
the
background
of
his
thoughts
theron
had
carried
along
a
notion
of
going
and
dining
with
father
forbes
when
the
time
for
the
evening
meal
should
arrive
the
idea
in
itself
attracted
him
as
a
fitting
capstone
to
his
resolve
not
to
go
home
to
supper
it
gave
just
the
right
kind
of
character
to
his
domestic
revolt
but
when
at
last
he
stood
on
the
doorstep
of
the
pastorate
waiting
for
an
answer
to
the
tinkle
of
the
electric
bell
he
had
heard
ring
inside
his
mind
contained
only
the
single
thought
that
now
he
should
hear
something
about
celia
perhaps
he
might
even
find
her
there
but
he
put
that
suggestion
aside
as
slightly
unpleasant
the
housekeeper
led
him
as
before
into
the
it
was
still
daylight
and
he
saw
on
the
glance
that
the
priest
was
alone
at
the
table
with
a
book
beside
him
to
read
from
as
he
ate
father
forbes
rose
and
came
forward
greeting
his
visitor
with
profuse
urbanity
and
smiles
if
there
was
a
perfunctory
note
in
the
invitation
to
sit
down
and
share
the
meal
theron
did
not
catch
it
he
frankly
displayed
his
pleasure
as
he
laid
aside
his
hat
and
took
the
chair
opposite
his
host
it
is
really
only
a
few
months
since
i
was
here
in
this
room
before
he
remarked
as
the
priest
closed
his
book
and
tossed
it
to
one
side
and
the
housekeeper
came
in
to
lay
another
place
yet
it
might
have
been
years
many
long
years
so
tremendous
is
the
difference
that
the
lapse
of
time
has
wrought
in
i
am
afraid
we
have
nothing
to
tempt
you
very
much
ware
remarked
father
forbes
with
a
gesture
of
his
plump
white
hand
which
embraced
the
dishes
in
the
centre
of
the
table
may
i
send
you
a
bit
of
this
boiled
mutton
i
have
very
homely
tastes
when
i
am
by
i
was
saying
theron
observed
after
some
moments
had
passed
in
silence
that
i
date
such
a
tremendous
revolution
in
my
thoughts
my
beliefs
my
whole
mind
and
character
from
my
first
meeting
with
you
my
first
coming
here
i
do
know
how
to
describe
to
you
the
enormous
change
that
has
come
over
me
and
i
owe
it
all
to
i
can
only
hope
then
that
it
is
entirely
of
a
satisfactory
nature
said
the
priest
politely
smiling
oh
it
is
so
splendidly
satisfactory
said
theron
with
fervor
i
look
back
at
myself
now
with
wonder
and
pity
it
seems
incredible
that
such
a
little
while
ago
i
should
have
been
such
an
ignorant
and
unimaginative
clod
of
earth
content
with
such
petty
ambitions
and
actually
proud
of
my
and
you
have
larger
ambitions
now
asked
the
other
pray
let
me
help
you
to
some
potatoes
i
am
afraid
that
ambitions
only
get
in
our
way
and
trip
us
up
we
clergymen
are
like
horses
the
more
steadily
we
jog
along
between
the
rails
the
better
it
is
for
oh
i
do
intend
to
remain
in
the
ministry
declared
theron
the
statement
seemed
to
him
a
little
bald
now
that
he
had
made
it
and
as
his
companion
lifted
his
brows
in
surprise
he
added
stumblingly
that
is
as
i
feel
now
it
seems
to
me
impossible
that
i
should
remain
much
longer
with
you
of
course
it
is
different
you
have
a
thousand
things
to
interest
and
pleasantly
occupy
you
in
your
work
and
its
ceremonies
so
that
mere
belief
or
in
the
dogma
hardly
matters
but
in
our
church
dogma
is
everything
if
you
take
that
away
or
cease
to
have
its
support
the
rest
is
intolerable
father
forbes
cut
another
slice
of
mutton
for
himself
it
is
a
pretty
serious
business
to
make
such
a
change
at
your
time
of
life
i
take
it
for
granted
you
will
think
it
all
over
very
carefully
before
you
commit
he
said
this
with
an
almost
indifferent
air
which
rather
chilled
his
listener
enthusiasm
oh
yes
theron
made
answer
i
shall
do
nothing
rash
but
i
have
a
good
many
plans
for
the
father
forbes
did
not
ask
what
these
were
and
a
brief
further
period
of
silence
fell
upon
the
table
i
hope
everything
went
off
smoothly
at
the
picnic
theron
ventured
at
last
i
have
not
seen
any
of
you
since
the
priest
shook
his
head
and
sighed
no
he
said
it
is
a
bad
business
i
have
had
a
great
deal
of
unhappiness
out
of
it
this
past
fortnight
that
young
man
who
was
rude
to
you
of
course
it
was
mere
drunken
irresponsible
nonsense
on
his
part
has
got
himself
into
a
serious
scrape
i
afraid
it
is
being
kept
quite
within
the
family
and
we
hope
to
manage
so
that
it
will
remain
there
but
it
has
terribly
upset
his
father
and
his
sister
but
that
after
all
is
not
so
hard
to
bear
as
the
other
affliction
that
has
come
upon
the
maddens
you
remember
michael
the
other
brother
he
seems
to
have
taken
cold
that
evening
or
perhaps
himself
he
has
been
seized
with
quick
consumption
he
will
hardly
last
till
snow
oh
i
am
grieved
to
hear
that
theron
spoke
with
tremulous
earnestness
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
michael
were
in
some
way
related
to
him
it
is
very
hard
upon
them
all
the
priest
went
on
michael
is
as
sweet
and
holy
a
character
as
it
is
possible
for
any
one
to
think
of
he
is
the
apple
of
his
father
eye
they
were
inseparable
those
two
do
you
know
the
father
madden
theron
shook
his
head
i
think
i
have
seen
him
he
said
a
small
man
with
gray
a
peasant
said
father
forbes
but
with
a
heart
of
gold
poor
man
he
has
had
little
enough
out
of
his
riches
ah
the
west
coast
people
what
tragedies
i
have
seen
among
them
over
here
they
have
rudimentary
lung
organizations
like
a
frog
to
fit
the
mild
wet
soft
air
they
live
in
the
sharp
air
here
kills
them
off
like
flies
in
a
frost
whole
families
go
i
should
think
there
are
a
dozen
of
old
jeremiah
children
in
the
cemetery
if
michael
could
have
passed
his
year
there
would
have
been
hope
for
him
at
least
till
his
these
pulmonary
things
seem
to
go
by
sevens
you
i
did
know
said
theron
it
is
very
strange
and
very
his
startled
mind
was
busy
all
at
once
with
conjectures
as
to
celia
age
the
sister
miss
madden
seems
extremely
strong
he
remarked
tentatively
celia
may
escape
the
general
doom
said
the
priest
his
guest
noted
that
he
clenched
his
shapely
white
hand
on
the
table
as
he
spoke
and
that
his
gentle
carefully
modulated
voice
had
a
gritty
hardness
in
its
tone
that
would
be
too
dreadful
to
think
of
he
added
theron
shuddered
in
silence
and
strove
to
shut
his
mind
against
the
thought
she
has
taken
michael
illness
so
deeply
to
heart
the
priest
proceeded
and
devoted
herself
to
him
so
untiringly
that
i
get
a
little
nervous
about
her
i
have
been
urging
her
to
go
away
and
get
a
change
of
air
and
scene
if
only
for
a
few
days
she
does
not
sleep
well
and
that
is
always
a
bad
i
think
i
remember
her
telling
me
once
that
sometimes
she
had
sleepless
spells
said
theron
she
said
that
then
she
banged
on
her
piano
at
all
hours
or
dragged
the
cushions
about
from
room
to
room
like
a
wild
woman
a
very
interesting
young
lady
do
you
find
her
so
father
forbes
let
a
wan
smile
play
on
his
lips
what
our
celia
he
said
interesting
why
ware
there
is
no
one
like
her
in
the
world
she
is
as
unique
as
what
shall
i
say
as
the
irish
are
among
races
her
father
and
mother
were
both
born
in
and
she
she
might
be
the
daughter
of
a
hundred
kings
except
that
they
seem
mostly
rather
than
otherwise
she
always
impresses
me
as
a
sort
of
atavistic
idealization
of
the
old
kelt
at
his
finest
and
best
there
in
ireland
you
got
a
strange
mixture
of
elementary
early
peoples
walled
off
from
the
outer
world
by
the
four
seas
and
free
to
work
out
their
own
racial
amalgam
on
their
own
lines
they
brought
with
them
at
the
outset
a
great
inheritance
of
eastern
mysticism
others
lost
it
but
the
irish
all
alone
on
their
island
kept
it
alive
and
brooded
on
it
and
rooted
their
whole
spiritual
side
in
it
their
religion
is
full
of
it
their
blood
is
full
of
it
our
celia
is
fuller
of
it
than
anybody
else
the
ireland
of
two
thousand
years
ago
is
incarnated
in
her
they
are
the
merriest
people
and
the
saddest
the
most
turbulent
and
the
most
docile
the
most
talented
and
the
most
unproductive
the
most
practical
and
the
most
visionary
the
most
devout
and
the
most
pagan
these
impossible
contradictions
war
ceaselessly
in
their
blood
when
i
look
at
celia
i
seem
to
see
in
my
mind
eye
the
fair
mother
of
them
theron
gazed
at
the
speaker
with
open
admiration
i
love
to
hear
you
talk
he
said
simply
an
unbidden
memory
flitted
upward
in
his
mind
those
were
the
very
words
that
alice
had
so
often
on
her
lips
in
their
old
courtship
days
how
curious
it
was
he
looked
at
the
priest
and
had
a
quaint
sensation
of
feeling
as
a
romantic
woman
must
feel
in
the
presence
of
a
specially
impressive
masculine
personality
it
was
indeed
strange
that
this
portly
creature
in
a
gown
with
his
white
fat
hands
and
his
feline
suavity
of
manner
should
produce
such
a
commanding
and
unique
effect
of
virility
no
doubt
this
was
a
part
of
the
great
sex
mystery
which
historically
surrounded
the
figure
of
the
celibate
priest
as
with
an
atmosphere
women
had
always
been
prostrating
themselves
before
it
theron
watching
his
companion
full
pallid
face
in
the
tried
to
fancy
himself
in
the
priest
place
looking
down
upon
these
worshipping
female
forms
he
wondered
what
the
attitude
really
was
the
enigma
fascinated
him
father
forbes
after
his
rhetorical
outburst
and
been
eating
he
pushed
aside
his
i
grow
enthusiastic
on
the
subject
of
my
race
sometimes
he
remarked
with
the
suggestion
of
an
apology
but
i
make
up
for
it
other
times
most
of
the
time
by
scolding
them
if
it
were
not
such
a
noble
thing
to
be
an
irishman
it
would
be
ah
said
theron
deprecatingly
who
would
not
be
enthusiastic
in
talking
of
miss
madden
what
you
said
about
her
was
perfect
as
you
spoke
i
was
thinking
how
proud
and
thankful
we
ought
to
be
for
the
privilege
of
knowing
her
we
who
do
know
her
well
although
of
course
your
friendship
with
her
is
vastly
more
intimate
than
mine
than
mine
could
ever
hope
to
the
priest
offered
no
comment
and
theron
went
on
i
hardly
know
how
to
describe
the
remarkable
impression
she
makes
upon
me
i
ca
imagine
to
myself
any
other
young
woman
so
brilliant
or
broad
in
her
views
or
so
courageous
of
course
her
being
so
rich
makes
it
easier
for
her
to
do
just
what
she
wants
to
do
but
her
bravery
is
astonishing
all
the
same
we
had
a
long
and
very
sympathetic
talk
in
the
woods
that
day
of
the
picnic
after
we
left
you
i
do
know
whether
she
spoke
to
you
about
it
father
forbes
made
a
movement
of
the
head
and
eyes
which
seemed
to
negative
the
suggestion
her
talk
continued
theron
gave
me
quite
new
ideas
of
the
range
and
capacity
of
the
female
mind
i
wonder
that
everybody
in
octavius
full
of
praise
and
admiration
for
her
talents
and
exceptional
character
in
such
a
small
town
as
this
you
would
think
she
would
be
the
centre
of
attention
the
pride
of
the
i
think
she
has
as
much
praise
as
is
good
for
her
remarked
the
priest
quietly
and
here
a
thing
that
puzzles
me
pursued
ware
i
was
immensely
surprised
to
find
that
ledsmar
does
even
think
she
is
smart
or
at
least
he
professes
the
utmost
intellectual
contempt
for
her
and
says
he
dislikes
her
into
the
bargain
but
of
course
she
dislikes
him
too
so
that
only
natural
but
i
ca
understand
his
denying
her
great
the
priest
smiled
in
a
dubious
way
do
borrow
unnecessary
alarm
about
that
ware
he
said
with
studied
smoothness
of
modulated
tones
these
two
good
friends
of
mine
have
much
enjoyment
out
of
the
idea
that
they
are
fighting
for
the
mastery
over
my
poor
unstable
character
it
has
grown
to
be
a
habit
with
them
and
a
hobby
as
well
and
they
pursue
it
with
tireless
zest
there
are
not
many
intellectual
diversions
open
to
us
here
and
they
make
the
most
of
this
one
it
amuses
them
and
it
is
not
without
its
charms
for
me
in
my
capacity
as
an
interested
observer
it
is
a
part
of
the
game
that
they
should
pretend
to
themselves
that
they
detest
each
other
in
reality
i
fancy
that
they
like
each
other
very
much
at
any
rate
there
is
nothing
to
be
disturbed
his
mellifluous
tones
had
somehow
the
effect
of
suggesting
to
theron
that
he
was
an
outsider
and
would
better
mind
his
own
business
ah
if
this
purring
of
a
priest
only
knew
how
little
of
an
outsider
he
really
was
the
thought
gave
him
an
easy
of
course
he
said
our
warm
mutual
friendship
makes
the
observation
of
these
little
individual
vagaries
merely
a
part
of
a
delightful
whole
i
should
not
dream
of
discussing
miss
madden
confidences
to
me
or
the
doctor
either
outside
our
own
little
father
forbes
reached
behind
him
and
took
from
a
chair
his
black
cap
with
the
tassel
unfortunately
i
have
a
sick
call
waiting
me
he
said
gathering
up
his
gown
and
slowly
rising
yes
i
saw
the
man
sitting
in
the
hall
remarked
theron
getting
to
his
feet
i
would
ask
you
to
go
upstairs
and
wait
the
priest
went
on
but
my
return
unhappily
is
quite
uncertain
another
evening
i
may
be
more
fortunate
i
am
leaving
town
tomorrow
for
some
days
but
when
i
get
back
the
polite
sentence
did
not
complete
itself
father
forbes
had
come
out
into
the
hall
giving
a
cool
nod
to
the
who
rose
from
the
bench
as
they
passed
and
shook
hands
with
his
guest
on
the
doorstep
when
the
door
had
closed
upon
ware
the
priest
turned
to
the
man
you
have
come
about
those
frames
he
said
if
you
will
come
upstairs
i
will
show
you
the
prints
and
you
can
give
me
a
notion
of
what
can
be
done
with
them
i
rather
fancy
the
idea
of
a
triptych
in
carved
old
english
if
you
can
manage
after
the
workman
had
gone
away
father
forbes
put
on
slippers
and
an
old
loose
soutane
lighted
a
cigar
and
pushing
an
over
to
the
reading
lamp
sat
down
with
a
book
then
something
occurred
to
him
and
he
touched
the
at
his
elbow
maggie
he
said
gently
when
the
housekeeper
appeared
at
the
door
i
will
have
the
coffee
and
fine
champagne
up
here
if
it
is
no
trouble
and
oh
maggie
i
was
compelled
this
evening
to
turn
the
blameless
visit
of
the
framemaker
into
a
venial
sin
and
that
involves
a
needless
wear
and
tear
of
conscience
i
think
that
hereafter
you
understand
i
am
not
invariably
at
home
when
the
rev
ware
does
me
the
honor
to
chapter
xxvii
that
night
brought
the
first
frost
of
the
season
worth
counting
in
the
morning
when
theron
came
downstairs
his
casual
glance
through
the
window
caught
a
desolate
picture
of
blackened
dahlia
stalks
and
shrivelled
blooms
the
gayety
and
color
of
the
garden
were
gone
and
in
their
place
was
shabby
and
dishevelled
ruin
he
flung
the
sash
up
and
leaned
out
the
nipping
autumn
air
was
good
to
breathe
he
looked
about
him
surveying
the
havoc
the
frost
had
wrought
among
the
flowers
and
smiled
at
breakfast
he
smiled
again
a
mirthless
and
calculated
smile
i
see
that
brother
gorringe
flowers
have
come
to
grief
over
night
he
remarked
alice
looked
at
him
before
she
spoke
and
saw
on
his
face
a
confirmation
of
the
hostile
hint
in
his
voice
she
nodded
in
a
constrained
way
and
said
nothing
or
rather
i
should
say
theron
went
on
with
deliberate
words
the
late
brother
gorringe
how
do
you
mean
late
asked
his
wife
swiftly
oh
calm
yourself
replied
the
husband
he
is
not
dead
he
has
only
intimated
to
me
his
desire
to
sever
his
connection
i
may
add
that
he
did
so
in
a
highly
offensive
i
am
very
sorry
said
alice
in
a
low
tone
and
with
her
eyes
on
her
plate
i
took
it
for
granted
you
would
be
grieved
at
his
backsliding
remarked
theron
making
his
phrases
as
pointed
as
he
could
he
was
such
a
promising
probationer
and
you
took
such
a
keen
interest
in
his
spiritual
awakening
but
the
frost
has
nipped
his
zeal
along
with
the
hundred
or
more
dollars
worth
of
flowers
by
which
he
testified
his
faith
i
find
something
interesting
in
their
having
been
blasted
alice
dropped
all
pretence
of
interest
in
her
breakfast
with
a
flushed
face
and
lips
tightly
compressed
she
made
a
movement
as
if
to
rise
from
her
chair
then
changing
her
mind
she
sat
bolt
upright
and
faced
her
husband
i
think
we
had
better
have
this
out
right
now
she
said
in
a
voice
which
theron
hardly
recognized
you
have
been
hinting
round
the
subject
long
enough
too
long
there
are
some
things
nobody
is
obliged
to
put
up
with
and
this
is
one
of
them
you
will
oblige
me
by
saying
out
in
so
many
words
what
it
is
you
are
driving
the
outburst
astounded
theron
he
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
gazed
at
his
wife
in
frank
surprise
she
had
so
accustomed
him
of
late
to
a
demeanor
almost
abject
in
its
depressed
docility
that
he
had
quite
forgotten
the
alice
of
the
old
days
when
she
had
spirit
and
courage
enough
for
two
and
a
notable
tongue
of
her
own
the
flash
in
her
eyes
and
the
lines
of
resolution
about
her
mouth
and
chin
for
a
moment
daunted
him
then
he
observed
by
a
flutter
of
the
frill
at
her
wrist
that
she
was
trembling
i
am
sure
i
have
nothing
to
out
in
so
many
words
as
you
put
it
he
replied
forcing
his
voice
into
cool
impassive
tones
i
merely
commented
upon
a
coincidence
that
was
all
if
for
any
reason
under
the
sun
the
subject
chances
to
be
unpleasant
to
you
i
have
no
earthly
desire
to
pursue
but
i
insist
upon
having
it
pursued
returned
alice
i
had
just
all
i
can
stand
of
your
insinuations
and
innuendoes
and
it
high
time
we
had
some
plain
talk
ever
since
the
revival
you
have
been
dropping
sly
underhand
hints
about
gorringe
and
and
me
now
i
ask
you
what
you
mean
by
yes
there
was
a
shake
in
her
voice
and
he
could
see
how
her
bosom
heaved
in
a
tremor
of
nervousness
it
was
easy
for
him
to
be
very
calm
it
is
you
who
introduce
these
astonishing
suggestions
not
i
he
replied
coldly
it
is
you
who
couple
your
name
with
his
somewhat
to
my
surprise
i
admit
but
let
me
suggest
that
we
drop
the
subject
you
are
excited
just
now
and
you
might
say
things
that
you
would
prefer
to
leave
unsaid
it
would
surely
be
better
for
all
concerned
to
say
no
more
about
alice
staring
across
the
table
at
him
with
knitted
brows
emitted
a
sharp
little
snort
of
indignation
well
i
never
theron
i
have
thought
it
of
you
there
are
so
many
things
you
would
have
thought
on
such
a
variety
of
subjects
he
observed
with
a
show
of
resuming
his
breakfast
but
why
continue
we
are
only
angering
each
never
mind
that
she
replied
with
more
control
over
her
speech
i
guess
things
have
come
to
a
pass
where
a
little
anger
wo
do
any
harm
i
have
a
right
to
insist
on
knowing
what
you
mean
by
your
theron
sighed
why
will
you
keep
harping
on
the
thing
he
asked
wearily
i
have
displayed
no
curiosity
i
do
ask
for
any
explanations
i
think
i
mentioned
that
the
man
had
behaved
insultingly
to
me
but
that
does
matter
i
do
bring
it
up
as
a
grievance
i
am
very
well
able
to
take
care
of
myself
i
have
no
wish
to
recur
to
the
incident
in
any
way
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
topic
is
listen
to
me
broke
in
alice
with
eager
gravity
she
hesitated
as
he
looked
up
with
a
nod
of
attention
and
reflected
as
well
as
she
was
able
among
her
thoughts
for
a
minute
or
two
this
is
what
i
want
to
say
to
you
ever
since
we
came
to
this
hateful
octavius
you
and
i
have
been
drifting
apart
or
no
that
does
express
it
simply
rushing
away
from
each
other
it
only
began
last
spring
and
now
the
space
between
us
is
so
wide
that
we
are
worse
than
complete
strangers
for
strangers
at
least
do
hate
each
other
and
i
had
a
good
many
occasions
lately
to
see
that
you
positively
do
hate
me
what
grotesque
absurdity
interposed
theron
impatiently
no
it
is
absurdity
it
gospel
truth
retorted
alice
and
interrupt
me
there
have
been
times
too
when
i
have
had
to
ask
myself
if
i
was
getting
almost
to
hate
you
in
return
i
tell
you
this
yes
you
are
undoubtedly
frank
commented
the
husband
toying
with
his
teaspoon
a
hypercritical
person
might
consider
almost
too
alice
scanned
his
face
closely
while
he
spoke
and
held
her
breath
as
if
in
expectant
suspense
her
countenance
clouded
once
more
you
realize
theron
she
said
gravely
your
voice
when
you
speak
to
me
your
look
your
manner
they
have
all
changed
you
are
like
another
man
some
man
who
never
loved
me
and
does
even
know
me
much
less
like
me
i
want
to
know
what
the
end
of
it
is
to
be
up
to
the
time
of
your
sickness
last
summer
until
after
the
soulsbys
went
away
i
let
myself
get
downright
discouraged
it
seemed
too
monstrous
for
belief
that
you
should
go
away
out
of
my
life
like
that
it
did
seem
possible
that
god
could
allow
such
a
thing
it
came
to
me
that
i
had
been
lax
in
my
christian
life
especially
in
my
position
as
a
wife
and
that
this
was
my
punishment
i
went
to
the
altar
to
intercede
with
him
and
to
try
to
loose
my
burden
at
his
feet
but
nothing
has
come
of
it
i
got
no
help
from
really
alice
broke
in
theron
i
explained
over
and
over
again
to
you
how
preoccupied
i
was
with
the
book
and
affairs
i
got
no
assistance
from
heaven
either
she
went
on
declining
the
diversion
he
offered
i
do
want
to
talk
impiously
but
if
there
is
a
god
he
has
forgotten
me
his
poor
you
are
talking
impiously
alice
observed
her
husband
and
you
are
doing
me
cruel
injustice
into
the
i
only
wish
i
were
she
replied
i
only
wish
to
god
i
were
well
then
accept
my
complete
assurance
that
you
are
that
your
whole
conception
of
me
and
of
what
you
are
pleased
to
describe
as
my
change
toward
you
is
an
entire
and
utter
mistake
of
course
the
married
state
is
no
more
exempt
from
the
universal
law
of
growth
development
alteration
than
any
other
human
institution
on
its
spiritual
side
of
course
viewed
either
as
a
sacrament
or
as
do
let
us
go
into
that
interposed
alice
abruptly
in
fact
there
is
no
good
in
talking
any
more
at
all
it
is
as
if
we
did
speak
the
same
language
you
do
understand
what
i
say
it
makes
no
impression
upon
your
quite
to
the
contrary
he
assured
her
i
have
been
deeply
interested
and
concerned
in
all
you
have
said
i
think
you
are
laboring
under
a
great
delusion
and
i
have
tried
my
best
to
convince
you
of
it
but
i
have
never
heard
you
speak
more
intelligibly
or
i
might
say
a
little
gleam
of
softness
stole
over
alice
face
if
you
only
gave
me
a
little
more
credit
for
intelligence
she
said
you
would
find
that
i
am
not
such
a
blockhead
as
you
think
i
come
come
he
said
with
a
smiling
show
of
impatience
you
really
must
impute
things
to
me
wholesale
like
she
was
glad
to
answer
the
smile
in
kind
no
but
truly
she
pleaded
you
do
realize
it
but
you
have
grown
into
a
way
of
treating
me
as
if
i
had
absolutely
no
mind
at
you
have
a
very
admirable
mind
he
responded
and
took
up
his
teaspoon
again
she
reached
for
his
cup
and
poured
out
hot
coffee
for
him
an
almost
cheerful
spirit
had
suddenly
descended
upon
the
breakfast
table
and
now
let
me
say
the
thing
i
have
been
aching
to
say
for
months
she
began
in
less
burdened
voice
he
lifted
his
brows
have
things
been
discussed
pretty
fully
already
he
asked
the
doubtful
harassed
expression
clouded
upon
her
face
at
his
words
and
she
paused
no
she
said
resolutely
after
an
instant
reflection
it
is
my
duty
to
discuss
this
too
it
is
a
misunderstanding
all
round
you
remember
that
i
told
you
gorringe
had
given
me
some
plants
which
he
got
from
some
garden
or
other
if
you
really
wish
to
go
on
with
the
subject
yes
i
have
a
recollection
of
that
particular
falsehood
of
he
did
it
with
the
kindest
and
friendliest
motives
in
the
world
protested
alice
he
saw
how
and
moping
i
was
here
among
these
strangers
and
i
really
was
getting
quite
peaked
and
and
he
said
i
stayed
indoors
too
much
and
it
would
do
me
all
sorts
of
good
to
work
in
the
garden
and
he
would
send
me
some
plants
the
next
i
knew
here
they
were
with
a
book
about
mixing
soils
and
planting
and
so
on
when
i
saw
him
next
and
thanked
him
i
suppose
i
showed
some
apprehension
about
his
having
laid
out
money
on
them
and
he
just
to
ease
my
mind
invented
the
story
about
his
getting
them
for
nothing
when
i
found
out
the
truth
i
got
it
out
of
that
boy
harvey
semple
he
admitted
it
quite
frankly
said
he
was
wrong
to
deceive
this
was
in
the
fine
first
fervor
of
his
term
of
probation
i
suppose
put
in
theron
he
made
no
effort
to
dissemble
the
sneer
in
his
voice
well
answered
alice
with
a
touch
of
acerbity
i
have
told
you
now
and
it
is
off
my
mind
there
never
would
have
been
the
slightest
concealment
about
it
if
you
had
begun
by
keeping
me
at
arm
length
and
making
it
next
door
to
impossible
to
speak
to
you
at
all
and
if
and
if
he
had
theron
as
he
finished
her
sentence
for
her
rose
from
the
table
dallying
for
a
brief
moment
by
his
chair
there
seemed
the
magnetic
premonition
in
the
air
of
some
further
and
kindlier
word
then
he
turned
and
walked
sedately
into
the
next
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
the
talk
was
finished
and
alice
left
alone
passed
the
knuckle
of
her
thumb
over
one
swimming
eye
and
then
the
other
and
bit
her
lips
and
swallowed
down
the
sob
that
rose
in
her
throat
chapter
xxviii
it
was
early
afternoon
when
theron
walked
out
of
his
yard
bestowing
no
glance
upon
the
withered
and
tarnished
show
of
the
garden
and
started
with
a
definite
step
down
the
street
the
tendency
to
ruminative
loitering
which
those
who
saw
him
abroad
always
associated
with
his
tall
spare
figure
was
not
suggested
today
he
moved
forward
like
a
man
with
a
purpose
all
the
forenoon
in
the
seclusion
of
the
with
a
book
opened
before
him
he
had
been
thinking
hard
it
was
not
the
talk
with
alice
that
occupied
his
thoughts
that
rose
in
his
mind
from
time
to
time
only
as
a
disagreeable
blur
and
he
refused
to
dwell
upon
it
it
was
nothing
to
him
he
said
to
himself
what
gorringe
motives
in
lying
had
been
as
for
alice
he
hardened
his
heart
against
her
just
now
it
was
her
mood
to
try
and
make
up
to
him
but
it
had
been
something
different
yesterday
and
who
could
say
what
it
would
be
tomorrow
he
really
had
passed
the
limit
of
patience
with
her
shifting
emotional
vagaries
now
lurching
in
this
direction
now
in
that
she
had
had
her
chance
to
maintain
a
hold
upon
his
interest
and
imagination
and
had
let
it
slip
these
were
the
accidents
of
life
the
inevitable
harsh
happenings
in
the
great
tragedy
of
nature
they
could
not
be
helped
and
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
he
had
bestowed
much
more
attention
upon
what
the
priest
had
said
the
previous
evening
he
passed
in
review
all
the
glowing
tributes
father
forbes
had
paid
to
celia
they
warmed
his
senses
as
he
recalled
them
but
they
also
in
a
curious
indefinite
way
caused
him
uneasiness
there
had
been
a
personal
fervor
about
them
which
was
something
more
than
priestly
he
remembered
how
the
priest
had
turned
pale
and
faltered
when
the
question
whether
celia
would
escape
the
general
doom
of
her
family
came
up
it
was
not
a
merely
pastoral
agitation
that
he
felt
sure
a
hundred
obscure
hints
doubts
stray
little
suspicions
crowded
upward
together
in
his
thoughts
it
became
apparent
to
him
now
that
from
the
outset
he
had
been
conscious
of
something
queer
yes
from
that
very
first
day
when
he
saw
the
priest
and
celia
together
and
noted
their
glance
of
recognition
inside
the
house
of
death
he
realized
now
upon
reflection
that
the
tone
of
other
people
his
own
parishioners
and
his
casual
acquaintances
in
octavius
alike
had
always
had
a
certain
note
of
reservation
in
it
when
it
touched
upon
miss
madden
her
running
in
and
out
of
the
pastorate
at
all
hours
the
way
the
priest
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
before
others
the
obvious
dislike
the
priest
ugly
old
housekeeper
bore
her
the
astonishing
freedom
of
their
talk
with
each
other
these
dark
memories
loomed
forth
out
of
a
mass
of
sinister
conjecture
he
could
bear
the
uncertainty
no
longer
was
it
indeed
not
entirely
his
own
fault
that
it
had
existed
thus
long
no
man
with
the
spirit
of
a
mouse
would
have
in
this
preposterous
fashion
week
after
week
with
the
fever
of
a
beautiful
woman
kiss
in
his
blood
and
the
woman
herself
living
only
round
the
corner
the
whole
world
had
been
as
good
as
offered
to
him
a
bewildering
world
of
wealth
and
beauty
and
spiritual
exaltation
and
love
and
he
like
a
weak
fool
had
waited
for
it
to
be
brought
to
him
on
a
salver
as
it
were
and
actually
forced
upon
his
acceptance
that
is
my
failing
he
reflected
these
miserable
ecclesiastical
bandages
of
mine
have
dwarfed
my
manly
side
the
meanest
of
thurston
clerks
would
have
shown
a
more
adventurous
spirit
and
a
bolder
nerve
if
i
do
not
act
at
once
with
courage
and
resolution
everything
will
be
lost
already
she
must
think
me
unworthy
of
the
honor
it
was
in
her
sweet
will
to
then
he
remembered
that
she
was
now
always
at
home
not
another
hour
of
foolish
indecision
he
whispered
to
himself
i
will
put
my
destiny
to
the
test
i
will
see
her
today
a
servant
answered
his
ring
at
the
of
the
madden
mansion
she
was
palpably
irish
and
looked
at
him
with
a
saddened
preoccupation
in
her
gray
eyes
holding
the
door
only
a
little
ajar
theron
had
got
out
one
of
his
cards
i
wish
to
make
inquiry
about
young
madden
michael
madden
he
said
holding
the
card
forth
tentatively
i
have
only
just
heard
of
his
illness
and
it
has
been
a
great
grief
to
he
is
no
better
answered
the
woman
briefly
i
am
the
rev
ware
he
went
on
and
you
may
say
that
if
he
is
well
enough
i
should
be
glad
to
see
the
servant
peered
out
at
him
with
a
suddenly
altered
expression
then
shook
her
head
i
do
think
he
would
be
wishing
to
see
you
she
replied
it
was
evident
from
her
tone
that
she
suspected
the
intentions
theron
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
i
have
not
come
as
a
clergyman
he
explained
but
as
a
friend
of
the
family
if
you
will
tell
miss
madden
that
i
am
here
it
will
do
just
as
well
yes
we
wo
bother
him
if
you
will
kindly
hand
my
card
to
his
when
the
domestic
turned
at
this
and
went
in
theron
felt
like
throwing
his
hat
in
the
air
there
where
he
stood
the
woman
churlish
sectarian
prejudices
had
played
ideally
into
his
hands
in
no
other
imaginable
way
could
he
have
asked
for
celia
so
naturally
he
wondered
a
little
that
a
servant
at
such
a
grand
house
as
this
should
leave
callers
standing
on
the
doorstep
still
more
he
wondered
what
he
should
say
to
the
lady
of
his
dream
when
he
came
into
her
presence
will
you
please
to
walk
this
way
the
woman
had
returned
she
closed
the
door
noiselessly
behind
him
and
led
the
way
not
up
the
sumptuous
staircase
as
theron
had
expected
but
along
through
the
broad
hall
past
several
large
doors
to
a
small
curtained
archway
at
the
end
she
pushed
aside
this
curtain
and
theron
found
himself
in
a
sort
of
conservatory
full
of
the
hot
vague
light
of
sunshine
falling
through
the
air
was
moist
and
close
and
heavy
with
the
smell
of
verdure
and
wet
earth
a
tall
bank
of
palms
with
ferns
sprawling
at
their
base
reared
itself
directly
in
front
of
him
the
floor
was
of
mosaic
and
he
saw
now
that
there
were
rugs
upon
it
and
that
there
were
chairs
and
sofas
and
other
signs
of
habitation
it
was
indeed
only
half
a
greenhouse
for
the
lower
part
of
it
was
in
rosewood
panels
with
floral
paintings
on
them
like
a
room
moving
to
one
side
of
the
barrier
of
palms
he
discovered
to
his
great
surprise
the
figure
of
michael
sitting
propped
up
with
pillows
in
a
huge
the
sick
man
was
looking
at
him
with
big
gravely
intent
eyes
his
face
did
not
show
as
much
change
as
theron
had
in
fancy
pictured
it
had
seemed
almost
as
bony
and
cadaverous
on
the
day
of
the
picnic
the
hands
spread
out
on
the
were
very
white
and
thin
though
and
the
gaze
in
the
blue
eyes
had
a
spectral
quality
which
disturbed
him
michael
raised
his
right
hand
and
theron
stepping
forward
took
it
limply
in
his
for
an
instant
then
he
laid
it
down
again
the
touch
of
people
about
to
die
had
always
been
repugnant
to
him
he
could
feel
on
his
own
warm
palm
the
very
damp
of
the
grave
i
only
heard
from
father
forbes
last
evening
of
your
your
he
said
somewhat
hesitatingly
he
seated
himself
on
a
bench
beneath
the
palms
facing
the
invalid
but
still
holding
his
hat
i
hope
very
sincerely
that
you
will
soon
be
all
right
my
sister
is
lying
down
in
her
room
answered
michael
he
had
not
once
taken
his
sombre
and
embarrassing
gaze
from
the
other
face
the
voice
in
which
he
uttered
this
remark
was
thin
in
fibre
cold
and
impassive
it
fell
upon
theron
ears
with
a
suggestion
of
hidden
meaning
he
looked
uneasily
into
michael
eyes
and
then
away
again
they
seemed
to
be
looking
straight
through
him
and
there
was
no
shirking
the
sensation
that
they
saw
and
comprehended
things
with
an
unnatural
prescience
i
hope
she
is
feeling
better
theron
found
himself
saying
father
forbes
mentioned
that
she
was
a
little
under
the
weather
i
dined
with
him
last
i
am
glad
that
you
came
said
michael
after
a
little
pause
his
earnest
unblinking
eyes
seemed
to
supplement
his
tongue
with
speech
of
their
own
i
do
be
thinking
a
great
deal
about
you
i
have
matters
to
speak
of
to
you
now
that
you
are
theron
bowed
his
head
gently
in
token
of
grateful
attention
he
tried
the
experiment
of
looking
away
from
michael
but
his
glance
went
back
again
irresistibly
and
fastened
itself
upon
the
sick
man
gaze
and
clung
there
i
am
next
door
to
a
dead
man
he
went
on
paying
no
heed
to
the
other
deprecatory
gesture
it
is
not
years
or
months
with
me
but
weeks
then
i
go
away
to
stand
up
for
judgment
on
my
sins
and
if
it
is
his
merciful
will
i
shall
see
god
so
i
say
my
now
and
so
you
will
let
me
speak
plainly
and
not
think
ill
of
what
i
say
you
are
much
changed
ware
since
you
came
to
octavius
and
it
is
not
a
change
for
the
theron
lifted
his
brows
in
unaffected
surprise
and
put
inquiry
into
his
glance
i
do
know
if
protestants
will
be
saved
in
god
good
time
or
not
continued
michael
i
find
there
are
different
opinions
among
the
clergy
about
that
and
of
course
it
is
not
for
me
only
a
plain
mechanic
to
be
sure
where
learned
and
pious
scholars
are
in
doubt
but
i
am
sure
about
one
thing
those
protestants
and
others
too
mind
you
who
profess
and
preach
good
deeds
and
themselves
do
bad
deeds
they
will
never
be
saved
they
will
have
no
chance
at
all
to
escape
i
think
we
are
all
agreed
upon
that
madden
said
theron
with
surface
suavity
then
i
say
to
you
ware
you
are
yourself
in
a
bad
path
take
the
warning
of
a
dying
man
sir
and
turn
from
it
the
impulse
to
smile
tugged
at
theron
facial
muscles
this
was
really
too
droll
he
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
the
while
he
forced
his
countenance
into
a
polite
composure
then
turned
again
to
michael
with
some
conciliatory
commonplace
ready
for
utterance
but
he
said
nothing
and
all
suggestion
of
levity
left
his
mind
under
the
searching
inspection
bent
upon
him
by
the
young
man
hollow
eyes
what
did
michael
suspect
what
did
he
know
what
was
he
hinting
at
in
this
strange
talk
of
his
i
saw
you
often
on
the
street
when
first
you
came
here
continued
michael
i
knew
the
man
who
was
here
before
you
that
is
by
sight
and
he
was
not
a
good
man
but
your
face
when
you
came
pleased
me
i
liked
to
look
at
you
i
was
tormented
just
then
do
you
see
that
so
many
decent
kindly
people
old
and
friends
and
neighbors
of
mine
and
for
that
matter
others
all
over
the
country
must
lose
their
souls
because
they
were
protestants
at
my
boyhood
and
young
manhood
that
thought
took
the
joy
out
of
me
sometimes
i
use
to
sleep
a
whole
night
long
for
thinking
that
some
lad
i
had
been
playing
with
perhaps
in
his
own
house
that
very
day
would
be
taken
when
he
died
and
his
mother
too
when
she
died
and
thrown
into
the
flames
of
hell
for
all
eternity
it
made
me
so
unhappy
that
finally
i
would
go
to
any
protestant
boy
house
and
have
his
mother
be
nice
to
me
and
give
me
cake
and
apples
and
me
thinking
all
the
while
that
they
were
bound
to
be
damned
no
matter
how
good
they
were
to
the
primitive
humanity
of
this
touched
theron
and
he
nodded
approbation
with
a
tender
smile
in
his
eyes
forgetting
for
the
moment
that
a
personal
application
of
the
monologue
had
been
hinted
at
but
then
later
as
i
grew
up
the
sick
man
went
on
i
learned
that
it
was
not
altogether
certain
some
of
the
authorities
i
found
maintained
that
it
was
doubtful
and
some
said
openly
that
there
must
be
salvation
possible
for
good
people
who
lived
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
through
no
fault
of
their
own
then
i
had
hope
one
day
and
no
hope
the
next
and
as
i
did
my
work
i
thought
it
over
and
in
the
evenings
my
father
and
i
talked
it
over
and
we
settled
nothing
of
it
at
all
of
course
how
could
we
did
you
ever
discuss
the
question
with
your
sister
it
occurred
suddenly
to
theron
to
interpose
he
was
conscious
of
some
daring
in
doing
so
and
he
fancied
that
michael
drawn
face
clouded
a
little
at
his
words
my
sister
is
no
theologian
he
answered
briefly
women
have
no
call
to
meddle
with
such
matters
but
i
was
saying
it
was
in
the
middle
of
these
doubtings
of
mine
that
you
came
here
to
octavius
and
i
noticed
you
on
the
streets
and
once
in
the
evening
i
made
no
secret
of
it
to
my
people
i
sat
in
the
back
of
your
church
and
heard
you
preach
as
i
say
i
liked
you
it
was
your
face
and
what
i
thought
it
showed
of
the
man
underneath
it
that
helped
settle
my
mind
more
than
anything
else
i
said
to
myself
is
a
young
man
only
about
my
own
age
and
he
has
education
and
talents
and
he
does
not
seek
to
make
money
for
himself
or
a
great
name
but
he
is
content
to
live
humbly
on
the
salary
of
a
and
devote
all
his
time
to
prayer
and
the
meditation
of
his
religion
and
preaching
and
visiting
the
sick
and
the
poor
and
comforting
them
his
very
face
is
a
pleasure
and
a
help
for
those
in
suffering
and
trouble
to
look
at
the
very
sight
of
it
makes
one
believe
in
pure
thoughts
and
merciful
deeds
i
will
not
credit
it
that
god
intends
damning
such
a
man
as
that
or
any
like
him
theron
bowed
with
a
slow
hesitating
gravity
of
manner
and
deep
not
wholly
complacent
attention
on
his
face
evidently
all
this
was
by
way
of
preparation
for
something
unpleasant
that
was
only
last
spring
said
michael
his
tired
voice
sank
for
a
sentence
or
two
into
a
meditative
and
it
was
my
last
spring
of
all
i
shall
not
be
growing
weak
any
more
or
drawing
hard
breaths
when
the
first
warm
weather
comes
it
will
be
one
season
to
me
hereafter
always
the
he
lifted
his
voice
with
perceptible
effort
i
am
talking
too
much
the
rest
i
can
say
in
a
word
only
half
a
year
has
gone
by
and
you
have
another
face
on
you
entirely
i
had
noticed
the
small
changes
before
one
by
one
i
saw
the
great
change
all
of
a
sudden
the
day
of
the
picnic
i
see
it
a
hundred
times
more
now
as
you
sit
there
if
it
seemed
to
me
like
the
face
of
a
saint
before
it
is
more
like
the
face
of
a
now
this
was
quite
too
much
theron
rose
flushed
to
the
temples
and
scowled
down
at
the
helpless
man
in
the
chair
he
swallowed
the
sharp
words
which
came
uppermost
and
bit
and
moistened
his
lips
as
he
forced
himself
to
remember
that
this
was
a
dying
man
and
celia
brother
to
whom
she
was
devoted
and
whom
he
himself
felt
he
wanted
to
be
very
fond
of
he
got
the
shadow
of
a
smile
on
to
his
countenance
i
fear
you
have
tired
yourself
unduly
he
said
in
as
a
tone
as
he
could
manage
he
even
contrived
a
little
deprecatory
laugh
i
am
afraid
your
real
quarrel
is
with
the
air
of
octavius
it
agrees
with
me
so
wonderfully
i
am
getting
as
fat
as
a
seal
but
i
do
hope
i
am
not
paying
for
it
by
such
a
wholesale
deterioration
inside
if
my
own
opinion
could
be
of
any
value
i
should
assure
you
that
i
feel
myself
an
infinitely
better
and
broader
and
stronger
man
than
i
was
when
i
came
michael
shook
his
head
dogmatically
that
is
the
greatest
pity
of
all
he
said
with
renewed
earnestness
you
are
entirely
deceived
about
yourself
you
do
not
at
all
realize
how
you
have
altered
your
direction
or
where
you
are
going
it
was
a
great
misfortune
for
you
sir
that
you
did
not
keep
among
your
own
people
that
poor
of
mine
though
the
drink
was
in
him
when
he
said
that
same
to
you
never
spoke
a
truer
word
keep
among
your
own
people
ware
when
you
go
among
others
you
know
what
i
mean
you
have
no
proper
understanding
of
what
their
sayings
and
doings
really
mean
you
do
not
realize
that
they
are
held
up
by
the
power
of
the
true
church
as
a
little
child
learning
to
walk
is
held
up
with
a
belt
by
its
nurse
they
can
say
and
do
things
and
no
harm
at
all
come
to
them
which
would
mean
destruction
to
you
because
they
have
help
and
you
are
walking
alone
and
so
be
said
by
me
ware
go
back
to
the
way
you
were
brought
up
in
and
leave
alone
the
people
whose
ways
are
different
from
yours
you
are
a
married
man
and
you
are
the
preacher
of
a
religion
such
as
it
is
there
can
be
nothing
better
for
you
than
to
go
and
strive
to
be
a
good
husband
and
to
set
a
good
example
to
the
people
of
your
church
who
look
up
to
you
and
mix
yourself
up
no
more
with
outside
people
and
outside
notions
that
only
do
you
mischief
and
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
say
to
theron
took
up
his
hat
i
take
in
all
kindness
what
you
have
felt
it
your
duty
to
say
to
me
madden
he
said
i
am
not
sure
that
i
have
altogether
followed
you
but
i
am
very
sure
you
mean
it
i
mean
well
by
you
replied
michael
wearily
moving
his
head
on
the
pillow
and
speaking
in
an
undertone
of
languor
and
pain
and
i
mean
well
by
others
that
are
nearer
to
me
and
that
i
have
a
right
to
care
more
about
when
a
man
lies
by
the
site
of
his
open
grave
he
does
not
be
meaning
ill
to
any
human
yes
thanks
quite
so
faltered
theron
he
dallied
for
an
instant
with
the
temptation
to
seek
some
further
explanation
but
the
sight
of
michael
eyes
and
expression
decided
him
against
it
it
did
not
seem
to
be
expected
either
that
he
should
shake
hands
and
with
a
few
perfunctory
words
of
hope
for
the
invalid
recovery
which
fell
with
a
jarring
note
of
falsehood
upon
his
own
ears
he
turned
and
left
the
room
as
he
did
so
michael
touched
a
bell
on
the
table
beside
him
theron
drew
a
long
breath
in
the
hall
as
the
curtain
fell
behind
him
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
escape
from
the
oppressive
humidity
and
heat
of
the
and
from
that
ridiculous
bore
of
a
michael
as
well
the
servant
warned
by
the
bell
stood
waiting
to
conduct
him
to
the
door
i
am
sorry
to
have
missed
miss
madden
he
said
to
her
she
must
be
quite
worn
out
perhaps
later
in
the
day
she
will
not
be
seeing
anybody
today
returned
the
woman
she
is
going
to
new
york
this
evening
and
she
is
taking
some
rest
against
the
will
she
be
away
long
he
asked
mechanically
the
servant
answer
i
have
no
idea
hardly
penetrated
his
consciousness
at
all
he
moved
down
the
steps
and
along
the
gravel
to
the
street
in
a
maze
of
mental
confusion
when
he
reached
the
sidewalk
under
the
familiar
elms
he
paused
and
made
a
definite
effort
to
pull
his
thoughts
together
and
take
stock
of
what
had
happened
of
what
was
going
to
happen
but
the
thing
baffled
him
it
was
as
if
some
drug
had
stupefied
his
faculties
he
began
to
walk
and
gradually
saw
that
what
he
was
thinking
about
was
the
fact
of
celia
departure
for
new
york
that
evening
he
stared
at
this
fact
at
first
in
its
nakedness
then
clothed
with
reassuring
suggestions
that
this
was
no
doubt
a
trip
she
very
often
made
there
was
a
blind
sense
of
comfort
in
this
idea
and
he
rested
himself
upon
it
yes
of
course
she
travelled
a
great
deal
new
york
must
be
as
familiar
to
her
as
octavius
was
to
him
her
going
there
now
was
quite
a
matter
of
course
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
then
there
burst
suddenly
uppermost
in
his
mind
the
other
fact
that
father
forbes
was
also
going
to
new
york
that
evening
the
two
things
spindled
upward
side
by
side
yet
separately
in
his
mental
vision
then
they
twisted
and
twined
themselves
together
he
followed
their
convolutions
miserably
walking
as
if
his
eyes
were
shut
in
slow
fashion
matters
defined
and
arranged
themselves
before
him
the
process
of
tracing
their
sequence
was
all
torture
but
there
was
no
possibility
no
notion
of
shirking
any
detail
of
the
pain
the
priest
had
spoken
of
his
efforts
to
persuade
celia
to
go
away
for
a
few
days
for
rest
and
change
of
air
and
scene
he
must
have
known
only
too
well
that
she
was
going
but
of
that
he
had
been
careful
to
drop
no
hint
the
possibility
of
accident
was
too
slight
to
be
worth
considering
people
on
such
intimate
terms
as
celia
and
the
priest
people
with
such
facilities
for
seeing
each
other
whenever
they
desired
did
not
find
themselves
on
the
same
train
of
cars
with
the
same
long
journey
in
view
by
mere
chance
theron
walked
until
dusk
began
to
close
in
upon
the
autumn
day
it
grew
colder
as
he
turned
his
face
homeward
he
wondered
if
it
would
freeze
again
and
then
remembered
the
shrivelled
flowers
in
his
wife
garden
for
a
moment
they
shaped
themselves
in
a
picture
before
his
mind
eye
he
saw
their
blackened
foliage
their
sicklied
drooping
stalks
and
wilted
blooms
and
as
he
looked
they
restored
themselves
to
the
vigor
and
grace
and
richness
of
color
of
as
vividly
as
if
they
had
been
painted
on
a
canvas
or
no
the
picture
he
stared
at
was
not
on
canvas
but
on
the
glossy
varnished
panel
of
a
luxurious
he
shook
his
head
angrily
and
blinked
his
eyes
again
and
again
to
prevent
their
seeing
seated
together
in
the
open
window
above
this
panel
the
two
people
he
knew
were
there
gloved
and
habited
for
the
night
journey
waiting
for
the
train
to
start
very
much
to
my
surprise
he
found
himself
saying
to
alice
watching
her
nervously
as
she
laid
the
i
find
i
must
go
to
albany
tonight
that
is
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
that
matter
but
i
think
it
may
easily
turn
out
to
be
greatly
to
my
advantage
to
go
something
has
arisen
i
ca
speak
about
it
as
yet
but
the
sooner
i
see
the
bishop
about
it
the
better
things
like
that
occur
in
a
life
where
boldly
striking
out
a
line
of
action
and
following
it
up
without
an
instant
delay
may
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
to
him
tomorrow
it
might
be
too
late
and
besides
i
can
be
home
the
sooner
alice
face
showed
surprise
but
no
trace
of
suspicion
she
spoke
with
studied
amiability
during
the
meal
and
deferred
with
such
unexpected
tact
to
his
implied
desire
not
to
be
questioned
as
to
the
mysterious
motives
of
the
journey
that
his
mood
instinctively
softened
and
warmed
toward
her
as
they
finished
supper
he
smiled
a
little
i
do
hope
i
sha
have
to
go
on
tomorrow
to
new
york
but
these
bishops
of
ours
are
such
one
never
knows
where
to
catch
them
as
like
as
not
sanderson
may
be
down
in
new
york
on
business
or
something
and
if
he
is
i
shall
have
to
chase
him
up
but
after
all
perhaps
the
trip
will
do
me
good
the
change
of
air
and
scene
you
i
sure
i
hope
so
said
alice
honestly
enough
if
you
do
go
on
to
new
york
i
suppose
you
go
by
the
everybody
talks
so
much
of
that
beautiful
sail
down
the
that
an
idea
exclaimed
theron
welcoming
it
with
enthusiasm
it
had
occurred
to
me
if
i
do
have
to
go
and
it
is
as
lovely
as
they
make
out
the
next
time
i
promise
i
wo
go
without
you
my
girl
i
have
been
rather
out
of
sorts
lately
he
continued
when
i
come
back
i
daresay
i
shall
be
feeling
better
more
like
my
old
self
then
going
to
try
alice
to
be
nicer
to
you
than
i
have
been
of
late
afraid
there
was
only
too
much
truth
in
what
you
said
this
never
mind
what
i
said
this
morning
or
any
other
time
broke
in
alice
softly
do
ever
remember
it
again
theron
if
only
only
he
rose
as
she
spoke
moved
round
the
table
to
where
she
sat
and
bending
over
her
stopped
the
faltering
sentence
with
a
kiss
when
was
it
he
wondered
that
he
had
last
kissed
her
it
seemed
years
ages
ago
an
hour
later
with
hat
and
overcoat
on
and
his
valise
in
his
hand
he
stood
on
the
doorstep
of
the
parsonage
and
kissed
her
once
more
before
he
turned
and
descended
into
the
darkness
he
felt
like
whistling
as
his
feet
sounded
firmly
on
the
plank
sidewalk
beyond
the
gate
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
never
been
in
such
capital
good
spirits
before
in
his
life
chapter
xxix
the
train
was
at
a
standstill
somewhere
and
the
dull
ashen
beginnings
of
daylight
had
made
a
first
feeble
start
toward
effacing
the
lamps
in
the
when
the
new
day
opened
for
theron
a
man
who
had
just
come
in
stopped
at
the
seat
upon
which
he
had
been
stretched
through
the
night
and
tapping
him
brusquely
on
the
knee
said
i
afraid
i
must
trouble
you
after
a
moment
of
confusion
he
sat
up
and
the
man
took
the
other
half
of
the
seat
and
opened
a
newspaper
still
damp
from
the
press
it
was
morning
then
theron
rubbed
a
clear
space
upon
the
clouded
window
with
his
thumb
and
looked
out
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
a
broad
stretch
of
tracks
and
beyond
this
the
shadowed
outlines
of
wagons
and
machinery
in
a
yard
with
a
background
of
factory
buildings
the
atmosphere
in
the
car
was
vile
beyond
belief
he
thought
of
opening
the
window
but
feared
that
the
man
with
the
paper
who
had
wakened
him
and
made
him
sit
up
might
object
they
were
the
only
people
in
the
car
who
were
sitting
up
backwards
and
forwards
on
either
side
of
the
narrow
aisle
the
dim
light
disclosed
recumbent
forms
curled
uncomfortably
into
corners
or
sprawling
at
difficult
angles
which
involved
the
least
interference
with
one
another
here
and
there
an
upturned
face
gave
a
livid
patch
of
surface
for
the
mingled
play
of
the
gray
dawn
and
the
yellow
a
ceaseless
noise
of
snoring
was
in
the
air
he
got
up
and
walked
to
the
tank
of
at
the
end
of
the
aisle
and
took
a
drink
from
the
most
inaccessible
portion
of
the
common
rim
the
happy
idea
of
going
out
on
the
platform
struck
him
and
he
acted
upon
it
the
morning
air
was
deliciously
cool
and
fresh
by
contrast
and
he
filled
his
lungs
with
it
again
and
again
standing
here
he
could
discern
beyond
the
buildings
to
the
right
the
faint
purplish
outlines
of
great
rounded
hills
some
workmen
one
of
them
bearing
a
torch
were
crouching
along
under
the
side
of
the
train
pounding
upon
the
resonant
wheels
with
small
hammers
he
recalled
having
heard
the
same
sound
in
the
watches
of
the
night
during
a
prolonged
halt
some
one
had
said
it
was
albany
he
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
at
the
thought
that
bishop
sanderson
would
never
know
about
the
visit
he
had
missed
swinging
himself
to
the
ground
he
bent
sidewise
and
looked
forward
down
the
long
train
there
were
five
six
perhaps
more
on
in
front
which
one
of
them
he
wondered
and
then
there
came
the
sharp
all
aboard
from
the
other
side
and
he
bundled
up
the
steps
again
and
entered
the
car
as
the
train
slowly
resumed
its
progress
he
was
now
and
quite
at
his
ease
he
took
his
seat
and
diverted
himself
by
winking
gravely
at
a
little
child
facing
him
on
the
next
seat
but
one
there
were
four
other
children
in
the
family
party
encamped
about
the
tired
and
still
sleeping
mother
whose
back
was
turned
to
theron
he
recalled
now
having
noticed
this
poor
woman
last
night
in
the
first
stage
of
his
journey
how
she
fed
her
brood
from
one
of
the
numerous
baskets
piled
under
their
feet
and
brought
water
in
a
tin
dish
of
her
own
from
the
tank
to
use
in
washing
their
faces
with
a
rag
and
loosened
their
clothes
to
dispose
them
for
the
night
sleep
the
face
of
the
woman
her
manner
and
slatternly
aspect
and
the
general
effect
of
her
belongings
bespoke
squalid
ignorance
and
poverty
watching
her
theron
had
felt
curiously
interested
in
the
performance
in
one
sense
it
was
scarcely
more
human
than
the
spectacle
of
a
cat
licking
her
kittens
or
a
cow
giving
suck
to
her
calf
yet
in
another
was
there
anything
more
human
the
child
who
had
wakened
before
the
rest
regarded
him
with
placidity
declining
to
be
amused
by
his
winkings
but
exhibiting
no
other
emotion
she
had
been
playing
by
herself
with
a
couple
of
buttons
tied
on
a
string
and
after
giving
a
civil
amount
of
attention
to
grimaces
she
turned
again
to
the
superior
attractions
of
this
toy
her
her
capacity
for
the
care
she
took
not
to
arouse
the
others
all
impressed
him
very
much
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
a
small
coin
and
reaching
forward
offered
it
to
her
she
took
it
calmly
bestowed
a
tranquil
gaze
upon
him
for
a
moment
and
went
back
to
the
buttons
her
indifference
produced
an
unpleasant
sensation
upon
him
somehow
and
he
rubbed
the
steaming
window
clear
again
and
stared
out
of
it
the
wide
river
lay
before
him
flanked
by
a
precipitous
wall
of
cliffs
which
he
knew
instantly
must
be
the
palisades
there
was
an
advertisement
painted
on
them
which
he
tried
in
vain
to
read
he
was
surprised
to
find
they
interested
him
so
slightly
he
had
heard
all
his
life
of
the
hudson
and
especially
of
it
just
at
this
point
the
reality
seemed
to
him
almost
commonplace
his
failure
to
be
thrilled
depressed
him
for
the
moment
i
suppose
those
are
the
palisades
he
asked
his
neighbor
the
man
glanced
up
from
his
paper
nodded
and
made
as
if
to
resume
his
reading
but
his
eye
had
caught
something
in
the
prospect
through
the
window
which
arrested
his
attention
by
george
he
exclaimed
and
lifted
himself
to
get
a
clearer
view
what
is
it
asked
theron
peering
forth
as
well
nothing
only
barclay
wendover
yacht
is
still
there
there
been
a
hitch
of
some
sort
they
were
to
have
left
is
that
it
that
long
black
thing
queried
theron
that
ca
be
a
yacht
can
it
what
do
you
think
it
is
answered
the
other
they
were
looking
at
a
slim
narrow
hull
lying
at
anchor
silent
and
motionless
on
the
drab
expanse
of
water
if
that
ai
a
yacht
they
have
begun
building
any
yet
they
taking
her
over
to
the
mediterranean
for
a
cruise
you
know
around
india
and
japan
for
the
winter
and
home
by
the
south

islands
friend
o
mine
in
the
party
would
mind
the
trip
but
do
you
mean
to
say
asked
theron
that
that
little
shell
of
a
thing
can
sail
across
the
ocean
why
how
many
people
would
she
hold
the
man
laughed
well
he
said
there
room
for
two
sets
of
quadrilles
in
the
chief
saloon
if
the
rest
keep
their
legs
well
up
on
the
sofas
but
there
only
ten
or
a
dozen
in
the
party
this
time
more
than
that
rather
get
in
one
another
way
especially
with
so
many
ladies
on
theron
asked
no
more
questions
but
bent
his
head
to
see
the
last
of
this
wonderful
craft
the
sight
of
it
and
what
he
had
heard
about
it
suddenly
gave
point
and
focus
to
his
thoughts
he
knew
at
last
what
it
was
that
had
lurked
formless
and
undesignated
these
many
days
in
the
background
of
his
dreams
the
picture
rose
in
his
mind
now
of
celia
as
the
mistress
of
a
yacht
he
could
see
her
reclining
in
a
low
upon
the
polished
deck
with
the
big
white
sails
billowing
behind
her
and
the
sun
shining
upon
the
deep
blue
waves
and
glistening
through
the
splash
of
spray
in
the
air
and
weaving
a
halo
of
glowing
gold
about
her
fair
head
ah
how
the
tender
visions
crowded
now
upon
him
eternal
summer
basked
round
this
enchanted
yacht
of
his
fancy
summer
sought
now
in
scottish
firths
or
norwegian
fiords
now
in
quaint
old
southern
harbors
ablaze
with
the
hues
of
strange
costumes
and
flowers
and
fruits
now
in
oriental
bays
and
lagoons
or
among
the
coral
reefs
and
of
the
luxurious
pacific
he
dwelt
upon
these
new
imaginings
with
the
fervent
longing
of
an
boy
every
vague
yearning
he
had
ever
felt
toward
stirred
again
in
his
blood
at
the
thought
of
the
sea
with
celia
why
not
she
had
never
visited
any
foreign
land
sometime
she
had
said
sometime
no
doubt
i
he
could
hear
again
the
wistful
musing
tone
of
her
voice
the
thought
had
fascinations
for
her
it
was
clear
how
irresistibly
would
it
not
appeal
to
her
presented
with
the
added
charm
of
a
roving
vagrant
independence
on
the
high
seas
free
to
speed
in
her
chariot
wherever
she
willed
over
the
deep
loitering
in
this
place
or
to
another
with
no
more
care
or
weight
of
responsibility
than
the
gulls
tossing
through
the
air
in
her
wake
theron
felt
rather
than
phrased
to
himself
that
there
would
not
be
ten
or
a
dozen
in
the
party
on
that
yacht
without
defining
anything
in
his
mind
he
breathed
in
fancy
the
same
bold
ocean
breeze
which
filled
the
sails
and
toyed
with
celia
hair
he
looked
with
her
as
she
sat
by
the
rail
and
saw
the
same
waves
racing
past
the
same
vast
dome
of
cloud
and
ether
that
were
mirrored
in
her
brown
eyes
and
there
was
no
one
else
anywhere
near
them
even
the
men
in
sailors
clothes
who
would
be
pulling
at
ropes
or
climbing
up
tarred
ladders
kept
themselves
considerately
outside
the
picture
only
celia
sat
there
and
at
her
feet
gazing
up
again
into
her
face
as
in
the
forest
the
man
whose
whole
being
had
been
consecrated
to
her
service
her
worship
by
the
kiss
you
passed
it
now
i
was
trying
to
point
out
the
jumel
house
to
you
where
aaron
burr
lived
you
theron
roused
himself
from
his
and
nodded
with
a
confused
smile
at
his
neighbor
thanks
he
faltered
i
did
hear
you
the
train
makes
such
a
noise
and
i
must
have
been
he
looked
about
him
the
night
aspect
as
of
a
tramps
had
quite
disappeared
from
the
car
everybody
was
sitting
up
and
the
more
impatient
were
beginning
to
collect
their
bundles
and
from
the
racks
and
floor
an
expressman
came
through
jangling
a
huge
bunch
of
brass
checks
on
leathern
thongs
over
his
arm
and
held
parley
with
passengers
along
the
aisle
outside
citified
streets
with
stores
and
factories
were
alternating
in
the
moving
panorama
with
open
fields
and
even
as
he
looked
these
vacant
spaces
ceased
altogether
and
successive
regular
lines
of
pavement
between
two
tall
rows
of
houses
all
alike
began
to
stretch
out
wheel
to
the
right
and
swing
off
out
of
view
for
all
the
world
like
the
avenues
of
he
remembered
as
a
boy
then
was
a
long
tunnel
its
darkness
broken
at
stated
intervals
by
brief
bursts
of
daylight
from
overhead
and
out
of
this
all
at
once
the
train
drew
up
its
full
length
in
some
vast
vaguely
lighted
enclosure
and
stopped
yes
this
is
new
york
said
the
man
folding
up
his
paper
and
springing
to
his
feet
the
narrow
aisle
was
filled
with
many
others
who
had
been
prompter
still
and
theron
stood
bag
in
hand
waiting
till
this
energetic
throng
should
have
pushed
itself
bodily
past
him
forth
from
the
car
then
he
himself
made
his
way
out
drifting
with
a
sense
of
helplessness
in
their
resolute
wake
there
rose
in
his
mind
the
sudden
conviction
that
he
would
be
too
late
all
the
passengers
in
the
forward
sleepers
would
be
gone
before
he
could
get
there
yet
even
this
terror
gave
him
no
new
power
to
get
ahead
of
anybody
else
in
the
tightly
packed
throng
once
on
the
broad
platform
the
others
started
off
briskly
they
all
seemed
to
know
just
where
they
wanted
to
go
and
to
feel
that
no
instant
of
time
was
to
be
lost
in
getting
there
theron
himself
caught
some
of
this
urgent
spirit
and
hurled
himself
along
in
the
throng
with
reckless
haste
knocking
his
bag
against
peoples
legs
but
never
pausing
for
apology
or
comment
until
he
found
himself
abreast
of
the
locomotive
at
the
head
of
the
train
he
drew
aside
from
the
main
current
here
and
began
searching
the
platform
far
and
near
for
those
he
had
travelled
so
far
to
find
the
platform
emptied
itself
theron
lingered
on
in
puzzled
hesitation
and
looked
about
him
in
the
whole
immense
station
with
its
acres
of
tracks
and
footways
and
its
incessantly
shifting
processions
of
people
there
was
visible
nobody
else
who
seemed
also
in
doubt
or
who
appeared
capable
of
sympathizing
with
indecision
in
any
form
another
train
came
in
some
way
over
to
the
right
and
before
it
had
fairly
stopped
swarms
of
eager
men
began
boiling
out
of
each
end
of
each
car
literally
precipitating
themselves
over
one
another
it
seemed
to
theron
in
their
excited
dash
down
the
steps
as
they
caught
their
footing
below
they
started
racing
down
the
platform
to
its
end
there
he
saw
them
looking
more
than
ever
like
clustered
bees
in
the
distance
struggling
vehemently
in
a
dense
mass
up
a
staircase
in
the
remote
corner
of
the
building
what
are
those
folks
running
for
is
there
a
fire
he
asked
an
young
mulatto
in
the
uniform
of
the
service
who
passed
him
with
some
light
no
they
harlem
people
i
guess
jes
catchin
the
elevated
all
sir
he
answered
obligingly
at
the
moment
some
passengers
emerged
slowly
from
one
of
the
and
came
loitering
toward
him
why
are
there
people
still
in
these
cars
he
asked
eagerly
they
all
gone
some
has
some
ai
the
porter
replied
they
most
generally
take
their
time
about
it
they
ai
no
hurry
so
long
they
get
out
we
drawn
round
to
the
there
was
still
hope
then
theron
took
up
his
bag
and
walked
forward
intent
upon
finding
some
place
from
which
he
could
watch
unobserved
the
belated
stragglers
issuing
from
the
he
started
back
all
at
once
confronted
by
a
of
violent
men
with
whips
and
badges
who
stunned
his
hearing
by
a
sudden
vociferous
outburst
of
shouts
and
yells
they
made
furious
gestures
at
him
with
their
whips
and
fists
to
enforce
the
incoherent
babel
of
their
voices
and
in
these
gestures
as
in
their
faces
and
cries
there
seemed
a
great
deal
of
menace
and
very
little
invitation
there
was
a
big
policeman
sauntering
near
by
and
theron
got
the
idea
that
it
was
his
presence
alone
which
protected
him
from
open
violence
at
the
hands
of
these
savage
hackmen
he
tightened
his
clutch
on
his
valise
and
turning
his
back
on
them
and
their
uproar
tried
to
brave
it
out
and
stand
where
he
was
but
the
policeman
came
lounging
slowly
toward
him
with
such
authority
in
his
swaying
gait
and
such
urban
omniscience
written
all
over
his
broad
sandy
face
that
he
lost
heart
and
beat
an
abrupt
retreat
off
to
the
right
where
there
were
a
number
of
doorways
near
which
other
people
had
ventured
to
put
down
baggage
on
the
floor
here
somewhat
screened
from
observation
he
stood
for
a
long
time
watching
at
odd
moments
the
ceaselessly
varying
phases
of
the
strange
scene
about
him
but
always
keeping
an
eye
on
the
train
he
had
himself
arrived
in
it
was
slow
and
dispiriting
work
a
dozen
times
his
heart
failed
him
and
he
said
to
himself
mournfully
that
he
had
had
his
journey
for
nothing
then
some
new
figure
would
appear
alighting
from
the
steps
of
a
sleeper
and
hope
revived
in
his
breast
at
last
when
over
half
an
hour
of
expectancy
had
been
marked
off
by
the
big
clock
overhead
his
suspense
came
to
an
end
he
saw
father
erect
and
substantial
form
standing
on
the
car
platform
nearest
of
all
balancing
himself
with
his
white
hands
on
the
rails
waiting
for
something
then
after
a
little
he
came
down
followed
by
a
black
porter
whose
arms
were
burdened
by
numerous
bags
and
parcels
the
two
stood
a
minute
or
so
more
in
hesitation
at
the
side
of
the
steps
then
celia
descended
and
the
three
advanced
the
importance
of
not
being
discovered
was
uppermost
in
theron
mind
now
that
he
saw
them
actually
coming
toward
him
he
had
avoided
this
the
previous
evening
in
the
octavius
depot
with
some
skill
he
flattered
himself
it
gave
him
a
pleasurable
sense
of
being
a
man
of
affairs
almost
a
detective
to
be
confronted
by
the
necessity
now
of
baffling
observation
once
again
he
was
still
rather
without
plans
for
keeping
them
in
view
once
they
left
the
station
he
had
supposed
that
he
would
be
able
to
hear
what
hotel
they
directed
their
driver
to
take
them
to
and
failing
that
he
had
fostered
a
notion
based
upon
a
story
he
had
read
when
a
boy
of
throwing
himself
into
another
carriage
and
bidding
his
driver
to
pursue
them
in
hot
haste
and
on
his
life
not
fail
to
track
them
down
these
devices
seemed
somewhat
empty
now
that
the
urgent
moment
was
at
hand
and
as
he
drew
back
behind
some
other
loiterers
out
of
view
he
sharply
racked
his
wits
for
some
way
of
coping
with
this
most
pressing
problem
it
turned
out
however
that
there
was
no
difficulty
at
all
father
forbes
and
celia
seemed
to
have
no
use
for
the
hackmen
but
moved
straight
forward
toward
the
street
through
the
doorway
next
to
that
in
which
theron
cowered
he
stole
round
and
followed
them
at
a
safe
distance
making
celia
hat
and
the
portmanteau
perched
on
the
shoulder
of
the
porter
behind
her
his
guides
to
his
surprise
they
still
kept
on
their
course
when
they
had
reached
the
sidewalk
and
went
over
the
pavement
across
an
open
square
which
spread
itself
directly
in
front
of
the
station
hanging
as
far
behind
as
he
dared
he
saw
them
pass
to
the
other
sidewalk
diagonally
opposite
proceed
for
a
block
or
so
along
this
and
then
separate
at
a
corner
celia
and
the
negro
lad
went
down
a
side
street
and
entered
the
door
of
a
vast
tall
building
which
occupied
the
whole
block
the
priest
turning
on
his
heel
came
back
again
and
went
boldly
up
the
broad
steps
of
the
front
entrance
to
this
same
structure
which
theron
now
discovered
to
be
the
murray
hill
hotel
fortune
had
indeed
favored
him
he
not
only
knew
where
they
were
but
he
had
been
himself
a
witness
to
the
furtive
way
in
which
they
entered
the
house
by
different
doors
nothing
in
his
own
limited
experience
of
hotels
helped
him
to
comprehend
the
notion
of
a
separate
entrance
for
ladies
and
their
luggage
he
did
not
feel
quite
sure
about
the
significance
of
what
he
had
observed
in
his
own
mind
but
it
was
apparent
to
him
that
there
was
something
underhanded
about
it
after
lingering
awhile
on
the
steps
of
the
hotel
and
satisfying
himself
by
peeps
through
the
glass
doors
that
the
coast
was
clear
he
ventured
inside
the
great
corridor
contained
many
people
coming
going
or
standing
about
but
none
of
them
paid
any
attention
to
him
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
and
beckoned
a
colored
boy
to
him
from
a
group
gathered
in
the
shadows
of
the
big
central
staircase
explaining
that
he
did
not
at
that
moment
wish
a
room
but
desired
to
leave
his
bag
the
boy
took
him
to
a
and
got
him
a
check
for
the
thing
with
this
in
his
pocket
he
felt
himself
more
at
his
ease
and
turned
to
walk
away
then
suddenly
he
wheeled
and
bending
his
body
over
the
counter
of
the
astonished
the
attendant
inside
by
the
eagerness
with
which
he
scrutinized
the
piled
rows
of
portmanteaus
trunks
overcoats
and
bundles
in
the
little
enclosure
what
is
it
you
want
here
your
bag
if
you
looking
for
that
this
man
said
to
him
no
thanks
it
nothing
replied
theron
straightening
himself
again
he
had
had
a
narrow
escape
father
forbes
and
celia
walking
side
by
side
had
come
down
the
small
passage
in
which
he
stood
and
had
passed
him
so
closely
that
he
had
felt
her
dress
brush
against
him
fortunately
he
had
seen
them
in
time
and
by
throwing
himself
half
into
the
had
rendered
recognition
impossible
he
walked
now
in
the
direction
they
had
taken
till
he
came
to
the
polite
colored
man
at
an
open
door
on
the
left
who
was
bowing
people
into
the
breakfast
room
standing
in
the
doorway
he
looked
about
him
till
his
eye
lighted
upon
his
two
friends
seated
at
a
small
table
by
a
distant
window
with
a
black
waiter
card
in
hand
bending
over
in
consultation
with
them
returning
to
the
corridor
he
made
bold
now
to
march
up
to
the
desk
and
examine
the
register
the
priest
name
was
not
there
he
found
only
the
brief
entry
miss
madden
octavius
written
not
by
her
but
by
father
forbes
on
the
line
were
two
numbers
in
pencil
with
an
and
between
them
an
indirect
question
to
one
of
the
clerks
helped
him
to
an
explanation
of
this
when
there
were
two
numbers
it
meant
that
the
guest
in
question
had
a
parlor
as
well
as
a
bedroom
here
he
drew
a
long
satisfied
breath
and
turned
away
the
first
half
of
his
quest
stood
completed
and
that
much
more
fully
and
easily
than
he
had
dared
to
hope
he
could
not
but
feel
a
certain
new
respect
for
himself
as
a
man
of
resource
and
energy
he
had
demonstrated
that
people
could
not
fool
with
him
with
impunity
it
remained
to
decide
what
he
would
do
with
his
discovery
now
that
it
had
been
so
satisfactorily
made
as
yet
he
had
given
this
hardly
a
thought
even
now
it
did
not
thrust
itself
forward
as
a
thing
demanding
instant
attention
it
was
much
more
important
first
of
all
to
get
a
good
breakfast
he
had
learned
that
there
was
another
and
less
formal
downstairs
in
the
basement
by
the
bar
with
an
entrance
from
the
street
he
walked
down
by
the
inner
stairway
instead
feeling
himself
already
at
home
in
the
big
hotel
he
ordered
an
ample
breakfast
and
came
out
while
it
was
being
served
to
wash
and
have
his
boots
blacked
and
he
gave
the
man
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
his
pockets
were
filled
with
silver
quarters
and
dollars
almost
to
a
burdensome
point
and
in
his
valise
was
a
bag
full
of
smaller
change
including
many
rolls
of
copper
cents
which
alice
always
counted
and
packed
up
on
mondays
in
the
hurry
of
leaving
he
had
brought
with
him
the
church
collections
for
the
past
two
weeks
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
must
keep
a
strict
account
of
his
expenditure
meanwhile
he
gave
ten
cents
to
another
man
in
a
cardigan
jacket
who
had
merely
stood
by
and
looked
at
him
while
his
boots
were
being
polished
there
was
a
sense
of
metropolitan
affluence
in
the
very
atmosphere
the
little
table
in
the
adjoining
room
on
which
theron
found
his
meal
in
waiting
for
him
seemed
a
vision
of
delicate
napery
and
refined
appointments
in
his
eyes
he
was
wolfishly
hungry
and
the
dishes
he
looked
upon
gave
him
back
assurances
by
sight
and
smell
that
he
was
very
happy
as
well
the
servant
in
attendance
had
an
extremely
white
apron
and
a
kindly
black
face
he
bowed
when
theron
looked
at
him
with
the
air
of
a
lifelong
admirer
and
humble
friend
i
suppose
you
have
claret
with
your
breakfast
sir
he
remarked
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
course
why
certainly
answered
theron
stretching
his
legs
contentedly
under
the
table
and
tucking
the
corner
of
his
napkin
in
his
certainly
my
good
chapter
xxx
at
ten
theron
loitering
near
the
bookstall
in
the
corridor
saw
father
forbes
come
downstairs
pass
out
through
the
big
front
doors
get
into
a
carriage
and
drive
away
this
relieved
him
of
a
certain
sense
of
responsibility
and
he
retired
to
a
corner
sofa
and
sat
down
the
detective
side
of
him
being
off
duty
so
to
speak
there
was
leisure
at
last
for
reflection
upon
the
other
aspects
of
his
mission
yes
it
was
high
time
for
him
to
consider
what
he
should
do
next
it
was
easier
to
recognize
this
fact
however
than
to
act
upon
it
his
mind
was
full
of
tricksy
devices
for
eluding
this
task
of
serious
thought
which
he
sought
to
impose
upon
it
it
seemed
so
much
pleasanter
not
to
think
at
all
but
just
to
drift
he
found
himself
watching
with
envy
the
men
who
as
they
came
out
from
their
breakfast
walked
over
to
the
bookstall
and
bought
cigars
from
the
row
of
boxes
nestling
there
among
the
newspaper
piles
they
had
such
evident
delight
in
the
work
of
selection
they
took
off
the
ends
of
the
cigars
so
carefully
and
lighted
them
with
such
meditative
attention
he
could
see
that
he
was
wofully
handicapped
by
not
knowing
how
to
smoke
he
had
had
the
most
wonderful
breakfast
of
his
life
but
even
in
the
consciousness
of
comfortable
repletion
which
pervaded
his
being
there
was
an
obstinate
sense
of
something
lacking
no
doubt
a
good
cigar
was
the
thing
needed
to
round
out
the
perfection
of
such
a
breakfast
he
half
rose
once
fired
by
a
sudden
resolution
to
go
over
and
get
one
but
of
course
that
was
nonsense
it
would
only
make
him
sick
he
sat
down
and
determinedly
set
himself
to
thinking
the
effort
finally
brought
fruit
and
of
a
kind
which
gave
him
a
very
unhappy
quarter
of
an
hour
the
lover
part
of
him
was
uppermost
now
insistently
exposing
all
its
raw
surfaces
to
the
stings
and
scalds
of
jealousy
up
to
this
moment
his
brain
had
always
evaded
the
direct
question
of
how
he
and
the
priest
relatively
stood
in
estimation
it
forced
itself
remorselessly
upon
him
now
and
his
thoughts
so
far
from
shirking
the
subject
seemed
to
rise
up
to
meet
it
it
was
extremely
unpleasant
all
this
but
then
a
calmer
view
asserted
itself
why
go
out
of
his
way
to
invent
anguish
for
himself
the
relations
between
celia
and
the
priest
whatever
they
might
be
were
certainly
of
old
standing
they
had
begun
before
his
time
his
own
romance
was
a
more
recent
affair
and
must
take
its
place
of
course
subject
to
existing
conditions
it
was
all
right
for
him
to
come
to
new
york
and
satisfy
his
legitimate
curiosity
as
to
the
exact
character
and
scope
of
these
conditions
but
it
was
foolish
to
pretend
to
be
amazed
or
dismayed
at
the
discovery
of
their
existence
they
were
a
part
of
the
situation
which
he
with
his
eyes
wide
open
had
accepted
it
was
his
function
to
triumph
over
them
to
supplant
them
to
rear
the
edifice
of
his
own
victorious
passion
upon
their
ruins
it
was
to
this
that
celia
kiss
had
invited
him
it
was
for
this
that
he
had
come
to
new
york
to
let
his
purpose
be
hampered
or
thwarted
now
by
childish
doubts
and
jealousies
would
be
ridiculous
he
rose
and
holding
himself
very
erect
walked
with
measured
deliberation
across
the
corridor
and
up
the
broad
staircase
there
was
an
elevator
near
at
hand
he
had
noticed
but
he
preferred
the
stairs
one
or
two
of
the
colored
boys
clustered
about
the
foot
of
the
stairs
looked
at
him
and
he
had
a
moment
of
dreadful
apprehension
lest
they
should
stop
his
progress
nothing
was
said
and
he
went
on
the
numbers
on
the
first
floor
were
not
what
he
wanted
and
after
some
wandering
about
he
ascended
to
the
next
and
then
to
the
third
every
now
and
then
he
encountered
attendants
but
intuitively
he
bore
himself
with
an
air
of
knowing
what
he
was
about
which
protected
him
from
inquiry
finally
he
came
upon
the
he
sought
passing
along
he
found
the
doors
bearing
the
numbers
he
had
memorized
so
well
they
were
quite
close
together
and
there
was
nothing
to
help
him
guess
which
belonged
to
the
parlor
he
hesitated
gazing
wistfully
from
one
to
the
other
in
the
instant
of
indecision
even
while
his
alert
ear
caught
the
sound
of
feet
coming
along
toward
the
passage
in
which
he
stood
a
thought
came
to
quicken
his
resolve
it
became
apparent
to
him
that
his
discovery
gave
him
a
certain
new
measure
of
freedom
with
celia
a
sort
of
right
to
take
things
more
for
granted
than
heretofore
he
chose
a
door
at
random
and
rapped
distinctly
on
the
panel
come
the
voice
he
knew
for
celia
the
single
word
however
recalled
the
usage
of
father
forbes
which
he
had
noted
more
than
once
at
the
pastorate
when
maggie
had
knocked
he
straightened
his
shoulders
took
his
hat
off
and
pushed
open
the
door
it
was
the
parlor
a
room
of
sofas
pianos
big
and
luxurious
a
tall
woman
was
walking
up
and
down
in
it
with
bowed
head
her
back
was
at
the
moment
toward
him
and
he
looked
at
her
saying
to
himself
that
this
was
the
lady
of
his
dreams
the
enchantress
of
the
kiss
the
woman
who
loved
him
but
somehow
it
did
not
seem
to
his
senses
to
be
celia
she
turned
and
moved
a
step
or
two
in
his
direction
before
she
mechanically
lifted
her
eyes
and
saw
who
was
standing
in
her
doorway
she
stopped
short
and
regarded
him
her
face
was
in
the
shadow
and
he
could
make
out
nothing
of
its
expression
save
that
there
was
a
general
effect
of
gravity
about
it
i
can
not
receive
you
she
said
you
must
go
away
you
have
no
business
to
come
like
this
without
sending
up
your
theron
smiled
at
her
the
notion
of
taking
in
earnest
her
inhospitable
words
did
not
at
all
occur
to
him
he
could
see
now
that
her
face
had
vexed
and
saddened
lines
upon
it
and
the
sharpness
of
her
tone
remained
in
his
ears
but
he
smiled
again
gently
to
reassure
her
i
ought
to
have
sent
up
my
name
i
know
he
said
but
i
could
bear
to
wait
i
just
saw
your
name
on
the
register
and
you
will
forgive
me
wo
you
i
ran
to
you
at
once
i
know
you
wo
have
the
heart
to
send
me
away
she
stood
where
she
had
halted
her
arms
behind
her
looking
him
fixedly
in
the
face
he
had
made
a
movement
to
advance
and
offer
his
hand
in
greeting
but
her
posture
checked
the
impulse
his
courage
began
to
falter
under
her
inspection
must
i
really
go
down
again
he
pleaded
it
a
crushing
penalty
to
suffer
for
such
little
indiscretion
i
was
so
excited
to
find
you
were
here
i
never
stopped
to
think
do
send
me
away
please
do
celia
raised
her
head
well
shut
the
door
then
she
said
since
you
are
so
anxious
to
stay
you
would
have
done
much
better
though
very
much
better
indeed
to
have
taken
the
hint
and
gone
will
you
shake
hands
with
me
celia
he
asked
softly
as
he
came
near
her
sit
there
please
she
made
answer
indicating
a
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
obeyed
her
but
to
his
surprise
instead
of
seating
herself
as
well
she
began
walking
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
floor
again
after
a
turn
or
two
she
stopped
in
front
of
him
and
looked
him
full
in
the
eye
the
light
from
the
windows
was
on
her
countenance
now
and
its
revelations
vaguely
troubled
him
it
was
a
celia
he
had
never
seen
before
who
confronted
him
i
am
much
occupied
by
other
matters
she
said
speaking
with
cold
impassivity
but
still
i
find
myself
curious
to
know
just
what
limits
you
set
to
your
theron
stared
up
at
her
his
lips
quivered
but
no
speech
came
to
them
if
this
was
all
merely
fond
playfulness
it
was
being
carried
to
a
point
i
saw
you
hiding
about
in
the
depot
at
home
last
evening
she
went
on
you
come
up
here
pretending
to
have
discovered
me
by
accident
but
i
saw
you
following
me
from
the
grand
central
this
yes
i
did
both
these
things
said
theron
boldly
a
fine
bravery
tingled
in
his
veins
all
at
once
he
looked
into
her
face
and
found
the
spirit
to
disregard
its
frowning
aspect
yes
i
did
them
he
repeated
defiantly
that
is
not
the
hundredth
part
or
the
thousandth
part
of
what
i
would
do
for
your
sake
i
have
got
way
beyond
caring
for
any
consequences
position
reputation
the
good
opinion
of
fools
what
are
they
life
itself
what
does
it
amount
to
nothing
at
all
with
you
in
the
balance
yes
but
i
am
not
in
the
balance
observed
celia
quietly
that
is
where
you
have
made
your
theron
laid
aside
his
hat
women
were
curious
creatures
he
reflected
some
were
susceptible
to
one
line
of
treatment
some
to
another
his
own
reading
of
celia
had
always
been
that
she
liked
opposition
of
a
smart
rattling
almost
cheeky
sort
one
got
on
best
with
her
by
saying
bright
things
he
searched
his
brain
now
for
some
clever
quip
that
would
strike
sparks
from
the
adamantine
mood
which
for
the
moment
it
was
her
whim
to
assume
to
cover
the
process
he
smiled
a
little
then
her
beauty
as
she
stood
before
him
her
queenly
form
clad
in
a
more
stiffly
fashionable
dress
than
he
had
seen
her
wearing
before
appealed
afresh
and
overwhelmingly
to
him
he
rose
to
his
feet
have
you
forgotten
our
talk
in
the
woods
he
murmured
with
a
wooing
note
have
you
forgotten
the
kiss
she
shook
her
head
calmly
i
have
forgotten
then
why
play
with
me
so
cruelly
now
he
went
on
in
a
voice
of
tender
deprecation
i
know
you
do
mean
it
but
all
the
same
it
bruises
my
heart
a
little
i
build
myself
so
wholly
upon
you
i
have
made
existence
itself
depend
so
completely
upon
your
smile
upon
a
soft
glance
in
your
eyes
that
when
they
are
not
there
why
i
suffer
i
do
know
how
to
live
at
all
so
be
kinder
to
me
celia
i
was
kinder
as
you
call
it
when
you
came
in
she
replied
i
told
you
to
go
away
that
was
pure
kindness
more
kindness
than
you
theron
looked
at
his
hat
where
it
stood
on
the
carpet
by
his
feet
he
felt
tears
coming
into
his
eyes
you
tell
me
that
you
remember
he
said
in
depressed
tones
and
yet
you
treat
me
like
this
perhaps
i
am
wrong
no
doubt
it
is
my
own
fault
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
have
come
down
here
at
celia
nodded
her
head
in
assent
to
this
view
but
i
swear
that
i
was
helpless
in
the
matter
he
burst
forth
i
had
to
come
it
would
have
been
literally
impossible
for
me
to
have
stayed
at
home
knowing
that
you
were
here
and
knowing
also
that
that
go
on
said
celia
thrusting
forth
her
a
trifle
and
hardening
still
further
the
gleam
in
her
eye
as
he
stumbled
over
his
sentence
and
left
it
unfinished
what
was
the
other
thing
that
you
were
knowing
he
took
up
the
word
hesitatingly
knowing
that
life
would
be
insupportable
to
me
if
i
could
not
be
near
she
curled
her
lip
at
him
you
skated
over
the
thin
spot
very
well
she
commented
it
was
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
to
mention
the
fact
that
father
forbes
came
with
me
oh
i
can
read
you
through
and
through
in
a
misty
way
theron
felt
things
slipping
from
his
grasp
the
rising
moisture
blurred
his
eyes
as
their
gaze
clung
to
celia
then
if
you
do
read
me
he
protested
you
must
know
how
utterly
my
heart
and
brain
are
filled
with
you
no
other
man
in
all
the
world
can
yield
himself
so
absolutely
to
the
woman
he
worships
as
i
can
you
have
taken
possession
of
me
so
wholly
i
am
not
in
the
least
master
of
myself
any
more
i
do
know
what
i
say
or
what
i
do
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
i
know
no
man
alive
could
be
that
but
no
one
else
will
idolize
and
reverence
you
as
i
do
believe
me
when
i
say
that
celia
and
how
can
you
blame
me
in
your
heart
for
following
you
thou
goest
i
will
go
and
where
thou
lodgest
i
will
lodge
thy
people
shall
be
my
people
and
thy
god
my
god
where
thou
diest
will
i
die
and
there
will
i
be
buried
the
lord
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
if
aught
but
death
part
thee
and
me
celia
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
moved
a
few
steps
away
from
him
something
like
despair
seized
upon
him
surely
he
urged
with
passion
surely
i
have
a
right
to
remind
you
of
the
kiss
she
turned
the
kiss
she
said
meditatively
yes
you
have
a
right
to
remind
me
of
it
oh
yes
an
undoubted
right
you
have
another
right
too
the
right
to
have
the
kiss
explained
to
you
it
was
of
the
order
it
signified
that
we
were
to
meet
again
and
that
just
for
one
little
moment
i
permitted
myself
to
be
sorry
for
you
that
was
he
held
himself
erect
under
the
incredible
words
and
gazed
blankly
at
her
the
magnitude
of
what
he
confronted
bewildered
him
his
mind
was
incapable
of
taking
it
in
you
mean
he
started
to
say
and
then
stopped
helplessly
staring
into
her
face
with
a
dropped
jaw
it
was
too
much
to
try
to
think
what
she
meant
a
little
sprouted
in
the
confusion
of
his
brain
it
grew
until
it
spread
a
bitter
smile
over
his
pale
face
i
know
so
little
about
kisses
he
said
i
am
such
a
greenhorn
at
that
sort
of
thing
you
should
have
had
pity
on
my
inexperience
and
told
me
just
what
brand
of
kiss
it
was
i
was
getting
probably
i
ought
to
have
been
able
to
distinguish
but
you
see
i
was
brought
up
in
the
country
on
a
farm
they
do
have
kisses
in
assorted
varieties
she
bowed
her
head
slightly
yes
you
are
entitled
to
say
that
she
assented
i
was
to
blame
and
it
is
quite
fair
that
you
should
tell
me
so
you
spoke
of
your
inexperience
your
innocence
that
was
why
i
kissed
you
in
saying
it
was
in
memory
of
that
innocence
of
yours
to
which
you
yourself
had
been
busy
saying
ever
since
i
first
saw
you
the
idea
seemed
to
me
to
mean
something
at
the
moment
i
see
now
that
it
was
too
subtle
i
do
not
usually
err
on
that
theron
kept
his
hold
upon
her
gaze
as
if
it
afforded
him
bodily
support
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
stoop
and
take
up
his
hat
but
he
dared
not
look
away
from
her
do
you
not
err
now
on
the
side
of
cruelty
he
asked
her
piteously
it
seemed
for
the
instant
as
if
she
were
wavering
and
he
swiftly
thrust
forth
other
pleas
i
admit
that
i
did
wrong
to
follow
you
to
new
york
i
see
that
now
but
it
was
an
offence
committed
in
entire
good
faith
think
of
it
celia
i
have
never
seen
you
since
that
day
that
day
in
the
woods
i
have
waited
and
waited
with
no
sign
from
you
no
chance
of
seeing
you
at
all
think
what
that
meant
to
me
everything
in
the
world
had
been
altered
for
me
torn
up
by
the
roots
i
was
a
new
being
plunged
into
a
new
existence
the
kiss
had
done
that
but
until
saw
you
again
i
could
not
tell
whether
this
vast
change
in
me
and
my
life
was
for
good
or
for
bad
whether
the
kiss
had
come
to
me
as
a
blessing
or
a
curse
the
suspense
was
killing
me
celia
that
is
why
when
i
learned
that
you
were
coming
here
i
threw
everything
to
the
winds
and
followed
you
you
blame
me
for
it
and
i
bow
my
head
and
accept
the
blame
but
are
you
justified
in
punishing
me
so
terribly
in
going
on
after
i
have
confessed
my
error
and
cutting
my
heart
into
little
strips
putting
me
to
death
by
torture
sit
down
said
celia
with
a
softened
weariness
in
her
voice
she
seated
herself
in
front
of
him
as
he
sank
into
his
chair
again
i
want
to
give
you
unnecessary
pain
but
you
have
insisted
on
forcing
yourself
into
a
position
where
there
is
anything
else
but
pain
i
warned
you
to
go
away
but
you
would
no
matter
how
gently
i
may
try
to
explain
things
to
you
you
are
bound
to
get
nothing
but
suffering
out
of
the
explanation
now
shall
i
still
go
on
he
inclined
his
head
in
token
of
assent
and
did
not
lift
it
again
but
raised
toward
her
a
disconsolate
gaze
from
a
pallid
drooping
face
it
is
all
in
a
single
word
ware
she
proceeded
in
low
tones
i
speak
for
others
as
well
as
myself
mind
you
we
find
that
you
are
a
theron
stiffened
countenance
remained
immovable
he
continued
to
stare
unblinkingly
up
into
her
eyes
we
were
disposed
to
like
you
very
much
when
we
first
knew
you
celia
went
on
you
impressed
us
as
an
innocent
simple
genuine
young
character
full
of
mother
milk
it
was
like
the
smell
of
early
spring
in
the
country
to
come
in
contact
with
you
your
honesty
of
nature
your
sincerity
in
that
absurd
religion
of
yours
your
general
naivete
of
mental
and
spiritual
all
pleased
us
a
great
deal
we
thought
you
were
going
to
be
a
real
just
a
moment
whom
do
you
mean
by
he
asked
the
question
calmly
enough
but
in
a
voice
with
an
effect
of
distance
in
it
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
enter
into
that
she
replied
let
me
go
on
but
then
it
became
apparent
little
by
little
that
we
had
misjudged
you
we
liked
you
as
i
have
said
because
you
were
unsophisticated
and
delightfully
fresh
and
natural
somehow
we
took
it
for
granted
you
would
stay
so
rut
that
is
just
what
you
did
do
just
what
you
had
the
sense
to
try
to
do
instead
we
found
you
inflating
yourself
with
all
sorts
of
egotisms
and
vanities
we
found
you
presuming
upon
the
friendships
which
had
been
mistakenly
extended
to
you
do
you
want
instances
you
went
to
ledsmar
house
that
very
day
after
i
had
been
with
you
to
get
a
piano
at
thurston
and
tried
to
inveigle
him
into
talking
scandal
about
me
you
came
to
me
with
tales
about
him
you
went
to
father
forbes
and
sought
to
get
him
to
gossip
about
us
both
neither
of
those
men
will
ever
ask
you
inside
his
house
again
but
that
is
only
one
part
of
it
your
whole
mind
became
an
unpleasant
thing
to
contemplate
you
thought
it
would
amuse
and
impress
us
to
hear
you
ridiculing
and
reviling
the
people
of
your
church
whose
money
supports
you
and
making
a
mock
of
the
things
they
believe
in
and
which
you
for
your
life
would
dare
let
them
know
you
did
believe
in
you
talked
to
us
slightingly
about
your
wife
what
were
you
thinking
of
not
to
comprehend
that
that
would
disgust
us
you
showed
me
once
do
you
remember
a
life
of
george
sand
that
you
had
just
bought
bought
because
you
had
just
discovered
that
she
had
an
unclean
side
to
her
life
you
chuckled
as
you
spoke
to
me
about
it
and
you
were
for
all
the
world
like
a
little
nasty
boy
giggling
over
something
dirty
that
older
people
had
learned
not
to
notice
these
are
merely
random
incidents
they
are
just
samples
picked
of
the
things
in
you
which
have
been
opening
our
eyes
little
by
little
to
our
mistake
i
can
understand
that
all
the
while
you
really
fancied
that
you
were
expanding
growing
in
all
directions
what
you
took
to
be
improvement
was
degeneration
when
you
thought
that
you
were
impressing
us
most
by
your
smart
sayings
and
doings
you
were
reminding
us
most
of
the
fable
about
the
donkey
trying
to
play
and
it
was
even
an
honest
straightforward
donkey
at
that
she
uttered
these
last
words
sorrowfully
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
and
her
eyes
sinking
to
the
floor
a
silence
ensued
then
theron
reached
a
groping
hand
out
for
his
hat
and
rising
walked
with
a
lifeless
automatic
step
to
the
door
he
had
it
half
open
when
the
impossibility
of
leaving
in
this
way
towered
suddenly
in
his
path
and
overwhelmed
him
he
slammed
the
door
to
and
turned
as
if
he
had
been
whirled
round
by
some
mighty
wind
he
came
toward
her
with
something
almost
menacing
in
the
vigor
of
his
movements
and
in
the
wild
look
upon
his
white
set
face
halting
before
her
he
covered
the
figure
the
coiled
red
hair
the
upturned
face
with
its
simulated
calm
the
big
brown
eyes
the
rings
upon
the
clasped
fingers
with
a
sweeping
comprehensive
glare
of
passion
this
is
what
you
have
done
to
me
then
his
voice
was
unrecognizable
in
his
own
ears
hoarse
and
broken
but
with
a
something
in
it
which
stimulated
his
rage
the
horrible
notion
of
killing
her
there
where
she
sat
spread
over
the
chaos
of
his
mind
with
an
effect
of
unearthly
light
red
and
abnormally
evil
it
was
like
that
first
devilish
radiance
ushering
in
creation
of
which
the
was
cain
why
should
he
not
kill
her
in
all
ages
women
had
been
slain
for
less
yes
and
men
had
been
hanged
something
rose
and
stuck
in
his
dry
throat
and
as
he
swallowed
it
down
the
sinister
flare
of
murderous
fascination
died
suddenly
away
into
darkness
the
world
was
all
black
again
plunged
in
the
egyptian
night
which
lay
upon
the
face
of
the
deep
while
the
earth
was
yet
without
form
and
void
he
was
alone
on
it
alone
among
awful
planetary
solitudes
which
crushed
him
the
sight
of
celia
sitting
motionless
only
a
pace
in
front
of
him
was
plain
enough
to
his
eyes
it
was
an
illusion
she
was
really
a
star
many
millions
of
miles
away
these
things
were
hard
to
understand
but
they
were
true
none
the
less
people
seemed
to
be
about
him
but
in
fact
he
was
alone
he
recalled
that
even
the
little
child
in
the
car
playing
with
those
two
buttons
on
a
string
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
take
his
money
yes
take
all
he
would
give
her
but
not
smile
at
him
not
come
within
reach
of
him
men
closed
the
doors
of
their
houses
against
him
the
universe
held
him
at
arm
length
as
a
nuisance
he
was
standing
with
one
knee
upon
a
sofa
unconsciously
he
had
moved
round
to
the
side
of
celia
and
as
he
caught
the
effect
of
her
face
now
in
profile
began
at
once
building
themselves
in
his
brain
pictures
of
her
standing
in
the
darkened
room
of
the
cottage
of
death
declaiming
the
confiteor
of
her
seated
at
the
piano
under
the
pure
mellowed
of
her
leaning
her
chin
on
her
hands
and
gazing
meditatively
at
the
leafy
background
of
the
woods
they
were
in
of
her
lying
back
indolently
content
in
the
on
the
yacht
of
his
fancy
that
yacht
which
a
few
hours
before
had
seemed
so
brilliantly
and
bewitchingly
real
to
him
and
now
now
he
sank
in
a
heap
upon
the
couch
and
burying
his
face
among
its
cushions
wept
and
groaned
aloud
his
collapse
was
absolute
he
sobbed
with
the
abandonment
of
one
who
in
the
veritable
presence
of
death
lets
go
all
sense
of
relation
to
life
presently
some
one
was
touching
him
on
the
shoulder
an
incisive
pointed
touch
and
he
checked
himself
and
lifted
his
face
you
will
have
to
get
up
and
present
some
sort
of
an
appearance
and
go
away
at
once
celia
said
to
him
in
low
rapid
tones
some
gentlemen
are
at
the
door
whom
i
have
been
waiting
as
he
stupidly
sat
up
and
tried
to
collect
his
faculties
celia
had
opened
the
door
and
admitted
two
visitors
the
foremost
was
father
forbes
and
he
with
some
whispered
smiling
words
presented
to
her
his
companion
a
tall
robust
florid
man
of
with
a
and
a
gray
mustache
sharply
waxed
the
three
spoke
for
a
moment
together
then
the
priest
wandering
eye
suddenly
lighted
upon
the
figure
on
the
sofa
he
stared
knitted
his
brows
and
then
lifted
them
in
inquiry
as
he
turned
to
celia
poor
man
she
said
readily
in
tones
loud
enough
to
reach
theron
it
is
our
neighbor
father
the
rev
ware
he
hit
upon
my
name
in
the
register
quite
unexpectedly
and
i
had
him
come
up
he
is
in
sore
distress
a
great
and
sudden
bereavement
he
is
going
now
wo
you
speak
to
him
in
the
hall
a
few
words
father
it
would
please
him
he
is
terribly
the
words
had
drawn
theron
to
his
feet
as
by
some
mechanical
process
he
took
up
his
hat
and
moved
dumbly
to
the
door
it
seemed
to
him
that
celia
intended
offering
to
shake
hands
but
he
went
past
her
with
only
some
confused
exchange
of
glances
and
a
murmured
word
or
two
the
tall
stranger
who
drew
aside
to
let
him
pass
had
acted
as
if
he
expected
to
be
introduced
theron
emerging
into
the
hall
leaned
against
the
wall
and
looked
dreamily
at
the
priest
who
had
stepped
out
with
him
i
am
very
sorry
to
learn
that
you
are
in
trouble
ware
father
forbes
said
gently
enough
but
in
hurried
tones
miss
madden
is
also
in
trouble
i
mentioned
to
you
that
her
brother
had
got
into
a
serious
scrape
i
have
brought
my
old
friend
general
brady
to
consult
with
her
about
the
matter
he
knows
all
the
parties
concerned
and
he
can
set
things
right
if
anybody
it
a
mistake
about
me
i
not
in
any
trouble
at
all
said
theron
i
just
dropped
in
to
make
a
friendly
the
priest
glanced
sharply
at
him
noting
with
a
swift
informed
scrutiny
how
he
sprawled
against
the
wall
and
what
vacuity
his
eyes
and
loosened
lips
expressed
then
you
have
a
talent
for
the
inopportune
amounting
to
positive
genius
said
father
forbes
with
a
stormy
smile
tell
me
this
father
forbes
the
other
demanded
with
impulsive
suddenness
is
it
true
that
you
do
want
me
in
your
house
again
is
that
the
truth
or
not
the
truth
is
always
relative
ware
replied
the
priest
turning
away
and
closing
the
door
of
the
parlor
behind
him
with
a
decisive
sound
left
alone
theron
started
to
make
his
way
downstairs
he
found
his
legs
wavering
under
him
and
making
zigzag
movements
of
their
own
in
a
bewildering
fashion
he
referred
this
at
first
in
an
outburst
of
fresh
despair
to
the
effects
of
his
great
grief
then
as
he
held
tight
to
the
banister
and
governed
his
descent
step
by
step
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
must
be
the
wine
he
had
had
for
breakfast
upon
examination
he
was
not
so
unhappy
after
all
chapter
xxxi
at
the
second
peal
of
the
brother
soulsby
sat
up
in
bed
it
was
still
and
the
memory
of
the
first
ringing
fluttered
musically
in
his
awakening
consciousness
as
a
part
of
some
dream
he
had
been
having
who
the
deuce
can
that
be
he
mused
aloud
in
querulous
resentment
at
the
interruption
put
your
head
out
of
the
window
and
ask
suggested
his
wife
drowsily
the
scraped
violently
in
its
socket
and
a
third
outburst
of
shrill
reverberations
clamored
through
the
silent
house
whatever
you
do
i
do
it
before
he
yanked
the
whole
thing
to
pieces
added
the
wife
with
more
decision
brother
soulsby
was
wide
awake
now
he
sprang
to
the
floor
and
groping
about
in
the
obscurity
began
drawing
on
some
of
his
clothes
he
rapped
on
the
window
during
the
process
to
show
that
the
house
was
astir
and
a
minute
afterward
made
his
way
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
the
boards
creaking
under
his
stockinged
feet
as
he
went
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
before
he
returned
sister
soulsby
lying
in
sleepy
quiescence
heard
vague
sounds
of
voices
at
the
front
door
and
did
not
feel
interested
enough
to
lift
her
head
and
listen
a
noise
of
footsteps
on
the
sidewalk
followed
first
receding
from
the
door
then
turning
toward
it
this
second
time
marking
the
presence
of
more
than
one
person
there
seemed
in
this
the
implication
of
a
guest
and
she
shook
off
the
dozing
impulses
which
enveloped
her
faculties
and
waited
to
hear
more
there
came
up
after
further
muttering
of
male
voices
the
undeniable
chink
of
coins
striking
against
one
another
then
more
footsteps
the
resonant
slam
of
a
carriage
door
out
in
the
street
the
grinding
of
wheels
turning
on
the
frosty
road
and
the
racket
of
a
vehicle
and
horses
going
off
at
a
smart
pace
into
the
night
somebody
had
come
then
she
yawned
at
the
thought
but
remained
well
awake
tracing
idly
in
her
mind
as
various
slight
sounds
rose
from
the
lower
floor
the
different
things
soulsby
was
probably
doing
their
spare
room
was
down
there
directly
underneath
but
curiously
enough
no
one
seemed
to
enter
it
the
faint
murmur
of
conversation
which
from
time
to
time
reached
her
came
from
the
parlor
instead
at
last
she
heard
her
husband
soft
tread
coming
up
the
staircase
and
still
there
had
been
no
hint
of
employing
the
what
could
he
be
about
she
wondered
brother
soulsby
came
in
bearing
a
small
lamp
in
his
hand
the
reddish
light
of
which
flaring
upward
revealed
an
display
of
amusement
on
his
thin
beardless
face
he
advanced
to
the
bedside
shading
the
glare
from
her
blinking
eyes
with
his
palm
and
grinned
a
thousand
guesses
old
lady
he
said
with
a
dry
chuckle
and
you
would
have
a
ghost
of
a
chance
you
might
guess
till
hades
froze
over
seven
feet
thick
and
still
you
would
hit
she
sat
up
in
turn
good
gracious
man
she
began
you
do
mean
here
the
cheerful
gleam
in
his
small
eyes
reassured
her
and
she
sighed
relief
then
smiled
confusedly
i
half
thought
just
for
the
minute
she
explained
it
might
be
some
bounder
who
come
east
to
try
and
blackmail
me
but
no
who
is
it
and
what
on
earth
have
you
done
with
him
brother
soulsby
cackled
in
merriment
it
brother
ware
of
octavius
out
on
a
little
bat
all
by
himself
he
says
he
been
on
the
loose
only
two
days
but
it
looks
more
like
a
our
brother
ware
she
regarded
him
with
surprise
well
yes
i
suppose
he
our
brother
ware
some
returned
soulsby
genially
he
seems
to
think
so
but
tell
me
about
it
she
urged
eagerly
what
the
matter
with
him
how
does
he
explain
it
well
he
explains
it
pretty
badly
if
you
ask
me
said
soulsby
with
a
droll
joking
eye
and
a
voice
he
seated
himself
on
the
side
of
the
bed
facing
her
and
still
considerately
shielding
her
from
the
light
of
the
lamp
he
held
but
do
think
i
suggested
any
explanations
i
been
a
mother
myself
he
merely
filled
himself
up
to
the
neck
with
rum
in
the
simple
ordinary
good
way
that
all
what
is
there
to
explain
about
that
she
looked
meditatively
at
him
for
a
time
shaking
her
head
no
soulsby
she
said
gravely
at
last
this
is
any
laughing
matter
you
may
be
sure
something
bad
has
happened
to
set
him
off
like
that
i
going
to
get
up
and
dress
right
now
what
time
is
it
now
do
you
do
anything
of
the
sort
he
urged
persuasively
it
is
five
it
be
dark
for
nearly
an
hour
yet
just
you
turn
over
and
have
another
nap
he
all
right
i
put
him
on
the
sofa
with
the
buffalo
robe
round
him
you
find
him
there
safe
and
sound
when
it
time
for
white
folks
to
get
up
you
know
how
it
breaks
you
up
all
day
not
to
get
your
full
i
do
care
if
it
makes
me
look
as
old
as
the
everlasting
hills
she
said
ca
you
understand
soulsby
the
thing
worries
me
gets
on
my
nerves
i
could
close
an
eye
if
i
tried
i
took
a
great
fancy
to
that
young
man
i
told
you
so
at
the
soulsby
nodded
and
turned
down
the
wick
of
his
lamp
a
trifle
yes
i
know
you
did
he
remarked
in
placidly
tones
i
ca
say
i
saw
much
in
him
myself
but
i
daresay
you
there
followed
a
moment
silence
during
which
he
experimented
in
turning
the
wick
up
again
but
anyway
he
went
on
there
is
anything
you
can
do
he
sleep
it
off
and
the
longer
he
left
alone
the
better
it
is
as
if
we
had
a
hired
girl
who
come
down
and
find
him
there
and
give
the
whole
thing
away
he
fixed
up
there
perfectly
comfortable
and
when
he
had
his
sleep
out
and
wakes
up
on
his
own
account
be
feeling
a
heap
the
argument
might
have
carried
conviction
but
on
the
instant
the
sound
of
footsteps
came
to
them
from
the
room
below
the
subdued
noise
rose
regularly
as
of
one
pacing
to
and
fro
no
soulsby
you
come
back
to
bed
and
get
your
sleep
out
i
going
downstairs
it
no
good
talking
i
brother
soulsby
offered
no
further
opposition
either
by
talk
or
demeanor
but
returned
contentedly
to
bed
pulling
the
comforter
over
his
ears
and
falling
into
the
slow
measured
respiration
of
tranquil
slumber
before
his
wife
was
ready
to
leave
the
room
the
dim
cold
gray
of
twilight
was
sifting
furtively
through
the
lace
curtains
of
the
front
windows
when
soulsby
lamp
in
hand
entered
the
parlor
she
confronted
a
figure
she
would
have
hardly
recognized
the
man
seemed
to
have
been
submerged
in
a
bath
of
disgrace
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
soles
of
his
feet
everything
about
him
was
altered
distorted
smeared
with
an
intangible
effect
of
shame
in
the
vague
gloom
of
the
middle
distance
between
lamp
and
window
she
noticed
that
his
shoulders
were
crouched
like
those
of
some
shambling
tramp
the
frowsy
shadows
of
a
stubble
beard
lay
on
his
jaw
and
throat
his
clothes
were
crumpled
and
hung
awry
his
boots
were
stained
with
mud
the
silk
hat
on
the
piano
told
its
battered
story
with
dumb
eloquence
lifting
the
lamp
she
moved
forward
a
step
and
threw
its
light
upon
his
face
a
little
groan
sounded
involuntarily
upon
her
lips
out
of
a
mask
of
unpleasant
features
swollen
with
drink
and
weighted
by
the
physical
craving
for
rest
and
sleep
there
stared
at
her
two
bloodshot
eyes
shining
with
the
wild
light
of
hysteria
the
effect
of
dishevelled
hair
relaxed
muscles
and
rough
lower
face
lent
to
these
eyes
as
she
caught
their
first
glance
an
unnatural
glare
the
lamp
shook
in
her
hand
for
an
instant
then
ashamed
of
herself
she
held
out
her
other
hand
fearlessly
to
him
tell
me
all
about
it
theron
she
said
calmly
and
with
a
soothing
motherly
intonation
in
her
voice
he
did
not
take
the
hand
she
offered
but
suddenly
with
a
wailing
moan
cast
himself
on
his
knees
at
her
feet
he
was
so
tall
a
man
that
the
movement
could
have
no
grace
he
abased
his
head
awkwardly
to
bury
it
among
the
folds
of
the
skirts
at
her
ankles
she
stood
still
for
a
moment
looking
down
upon
him
then
blowing
out
the
light
she
reached
over
and
set
the
smoking
lamp
on
the
piano
near
by
the
daylight
made
things
distinguishable
in
a
wan
uncertain
way
throughout
the
room
i
have
come
out
of
hell
for
the
sake
of
hearing
some
human
being
speak
to
me
like
that
the
thick
utterance
proceeded
in
a
muffled
fashion
from
where
his
face
grovelled
against
her
dress
its
despairing
accents
appealed
to
her
but
even
more
was
she
touched
by
the
ungainly
figure
he
made
sprawling
on
the
carpet
well
since
you
are
out
stay
out
she
answered
as
reassuringly
as
she
could
but
get
up
and
take
a
seat
here
beside
me
like
a
sensible
man
and
tell
me
all
about
it
come
i
insist
in
obedience
to
her
tone
and
the
sharp
tug
at
his
shoulder
with
which
she
emphasized
it
he
got
slowly
to
his
feet
and
listlessly
seated
himself
on
the
sofa
to
which
she
pointed
he
hung
his
head
and
began
catching
his
breath
with
a
periodical
gasp
half
hiccough
half
sob
first
of
all
she
said
in
her
brisk
manner
you
want
to
lie
down
there
again
and
have
me
tuck
you
up
snug
with
the
buffalo
robe
and
go
to
sleep
that
would
be
the
best
thing
you
could
he
shook
his
head
disconsolately
from
side
to
side
i
ca
he
groaned
with
a
swifter
recurrence
of
the
convulsions
dying
for
sleep
but
i
too
too
frightened
come
i
sit
beside
you
till
you
drop
off
she
said
with
masterful
decision
he
suffered
himself
to
be
pushed
into
recumbency
on
the
couch
and
put
his
head
with
docility
on
the
pillow
she
brought
from
the
spare
room
when
she
had
spread
the
fur
over
him
and
pushed
her
chair
close
to
the
sofa
she
stood
by
it
for
a
little
looking
down
in
meditation
at
his
demoralized
face
under
the
painful
of
wretchedness
and
fatigued
debauchery
she
traced
reflectively
the
lineaments
of
the
younger
and
cleanlier
countenance
she
had
seen
a
few
months
before
nothing
essential
had
been
taken
away
there
was
only
this
pestiferous
overlaying
of
shame
and
cowardice
to
be
removed
the
face
underneath
was
still
all
right
with
a
soft
maternal
touch
she
smoothed
the
hair
from
his
forehead
into
order
then
she
seated
herself
and
when
he
got
his
hand
out
from
under
the
robe
and
thrust
it
forth
timidly
she
took
it
in
hers
and
held
it
in
a
warm
sympathetic
grasp
he
closed
his
eyes
at
this
and
gradually
the
paroxysmal
catch
in
his
breathing
lapsed
the
daylight
strengthened
until
at
last
tiny
flecks
of
sunshine
twinkled
in
the
meshes
of
the
further
curtains
at
the
window
she
fancied
him
asleep
and
gently
sought
to
disengage
her
hand
but
his
fingers
clutched
at
it
with
vehemence
and
his
eyes
were
wide
open
i
ca
sleep
at
all
he
murmured
i
want
to
there
nothing
in
the
world
to
hinder
you
she
commented
smilingly
i
tell
you
the
solemn
truth
he
said
lifting
his
voice
in
dogged
assertion
the
best
sermon
i
ever
preached
in
my
life
i
preached
only
three
weeks
ago
at
the
it
was
admitted
by
everybody
to
be
far
and
away
my
finest
effort
they
will
tell
you
the
same
it
quite
likely
assented
sister
soulsby
i
quite
believe
then
how
can
anybody
say
that
i
degenerated
that
i
become
a
fool
he
demanded
i
have
heard
anybody
hint
at
such
a
thing
she
answered
quietly
no
of
course
you
have
heard
them
he
cried
i
heard
them
though
then
forcing
himself
to
a
sitting
posture
against
the
restraint
of
her
hand
he
flung
back
the
covering
i
burning
hot
already
yes
those
were
the
identical
words
i
have
improved
degenerated
people
hate
me
they
wo
have
me
in
their
houses
they
say
i
a
nuisance
and
a
bore
i
like
a
little
nasty
boy
that
what
they
say
even
a
young
man
who
was
dying
lying
right
on
the
edge
of
his
open
grave
told
me
solemnly
that
i
reminded
him
of
a
saint
once
but
i
was
only
fit
for
a
barkeeper
now
they
say
i
really
do
know
anything
at
all
and
i
not
only
a
fool
they
say
i
a
dishonest
fool
into
the
bargain
but
who
says
such
twaddle
as
that
she
returned
consolingly
the
violence
of
his
emotion
disturbed
her
you
must
imagine
such
things
you
are
among
friends
here
other
people
are
your
friends
too
they
have
the
very
highest
opinion
of
i
have
a
friend
on
earth
but
you
he
declared
solemnly
his
eyes
glowed
fiercely
and
his
voice
sank
into
a
grave
intensity
of
tone
i
was
going
to
kill
myself
i
went
on
to
the
big
bridge
to
throw
myself
off
and
a
policeman
saw
me
trying
to
climb
over
the
railing
and
he
grabbed
me
and
marched
me
away
then
he
threw
me
out
at
the
entrance
and
said
he
would
club
my
head
off
if
i
came
there
again
and
then
i
went
and
stood
and
let
the
pass
close
by
me
and
twenty
times
i
thought
i
had
the
nerve
to
throw
myself
under
the
next
one
and
then
i
waited
for
the
next
and
i
was
afraid
and
then
i
was
in
a
crowd
somewhere
and
the
warning
came
to
me
that
i
was
going
to
die
the
fool
need
go
kill
himself
god
would
take
care
of
that
it
was
my
heart
you
know
i
had
that
terrible
fluttering
once
before
it
seized
me
this
time
and
i
fell
down
in
the
crowd
and
some
people
walked
over
me
but
some
one
else
helped
me
up
and
let
me
sit
down
in
a
big
lighted
hallway
the
entrance
to
some
theatre
and
some
one
brought
me
some
brandy
but
somebody
else
said
i
was
drunk
and
they
took
it
away
again
and
put
me
out
they
could
see
i
was
a
fool
that
i
had
a
friend
on
earth
and
when
i
went
out
there
was
a
big
picture
of
a
woman
in
tights
and
the
word
overhead
and
then
i
remembered
you
i
knew
you
were
my
friend
the
only
one
i
have
on
it
is
very
flattering
to
be
remembered
like
that
said
sister
soulsby
gently
the
disposition
to
laugh
was
smothered
by
a
pained
perception
of
the
suffering
he
was
undergoing
his
face
had
grown
drawn
and
haggard
under
the
burden
of
his
memories
as
he
rambled
on
so
i
came
straight
to
you
he
began
again
i
had
just
money
enough
left
to
pay
my
fare
the
rest
is
in
my
valise
at
the
hotel
the
murray
hill
hotel
it
belongs
to
the
church
i
stole
it
from
the
church
when
i
am
dead
they
can
get
it
back
again
sister
soulsby
forced
a
smile
to
her
lips
what
nonsense
you
talk
about
dying
she
exclaimed
why
man
alive
you
sleep
this
all
off
like
a
top
if
you
only
lie
down
and
give
yourself
a
chance
come
now
you
must
do
as
you
with
a
resolute
hand
she
made
him
lie
down
again
and
once
more
covered
him
with
the
fur
he
submitted
and
did
not
even
offer
to
put
out
his
arm
this
time
but
looked
in
piteous
dumbness
at
her
for
a
long
time
while
she
sat
thus
in
silence
the
sound
of
brother
soulsby
moving
about
upstairs
became
audible
theron
heard
it
and
the
importance
of
hurrying
on
some
further
disclosure
seemed
to
suggest
itself
i
can
see
you
think
i
just
drunk
he
said
in
low
sombre
tones
of
course
that
what
he
thought
the
hackman
thought
so
and
so
did
the
conductor
and
everybody
but
i
hoped
you
would
know
better
i
was
sure
you
would
see
that
it
was
something
worse
than
that
see
here
i
tell
you
then
you
understand
i
been
drinking
for
two
days
and
one
whole
night
on
my
feet
all
the
while
wandering
alone
in
that
big
strange
new
york
going
through
places
where
they
murdered
men
for
ten
cents
mixing
myself
up
with
the
worst
people
in
low
and
and
they
saw
i
had
money
in
my
pocket
too
and
yet
nobody
touched
me
or
offered
to
lay
a
finger
on
me
do
you
know
why
they
understood
that
i
wanted
to
get
drunk
and
could
the
indians
wo
harm
an
idiot
or
lunatic
you
know
well
it
was
the
same
with
these
vilest
of
the
vile
they
saw
that
i
was
a
fool
whom
god
had
taken
hold
of
to
break
his
heart
first
and
then
to
craze
his
brain
and
then
to
fling
him
on
a
dunghill
to
die
like
a
dog
they
believe
in
god
those
people
the
only
ones
who
do
it
seems
to
me
and
they
would
interfere
when
they
saw
what
he
was
doing
to
me
but
i
tell
you
i
was
drunk
i
have
been
drunk
i
only
and
crushed
out
of
shape
and
life
that
all
and
i
crawled
here
just
to
have
a
friend
by
me
when
when
i
come
to
the
you
not
talking
very
sensibly
or
very
bravely
either
theron
ware
remarked
his
companion
it
cowardly
to
give
way
to
notions
like
oh
i
not
afraid
to
die
do
think
that
he
remonstrated
wearily
if
there
is
a
judgment
it
has
hit
me
as
hard
as
it
can
already
there
ca
be
any
hell
worse
than
that
i
gone
through
here
i
am
talking
about
hell
he
continued
with
a
pained
contraction
of
the
muscles
about
his
mouth
a
stillborn
malformed
smile
as
if
i
believed
in
one
i
got
way
through
all
my
beliefs
you
know
i
tell
you
that
it
none
of
my
business
she
reassured
him
i
not
your
bishop
or
your
confessor
i
just
your
friend
your
pal
that
look
here
he
broke
in
with
some
animation
and
a
new
intensity
of
glance
and
voice
if
i
was
going
to
live
i
have
some
funny
things
to
tell
six
months
ago
i
was
a
good
man
i
not
only
seemed
to
be
good
to
others
and
to
myself
but
i
was
good
i
had
a
soul
i
had
a
conscience
i
was
going
along
doing
my
duty
and
i
was
happy
in
it
we
were
poor
alice
and
i
and
people
behaved
rather
hard
toward
us
and
sometimes
we
were
a
little
down
in
the
mouth
about
it
but
that
was
all
we
really
were
happy
and
i
i
really
was
a
good
man
here
the
kind
of
joke
god
plays
you
see
me
here
six
months
after
look
at
me
i
have
got
an
honest
hair
in
my
head
i
a
bad
man
through
and
through
that
what
i
am
i
look
all
around
at
myself
and
there
is
an
atom
left
anywhere
of
the
good
man
i
used
to
be
and
mind
you
i
never
lifted
a
finger
to
prevent
the
change
i
did
resist
once
i
did
make
any
fight
i
just
walked
deliberately
with
my
eyes
wide
open
i
told
myself
all
the
while
that
i
was
climbing
uphill
instead
but
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
it
was
a
lie
everything
about
me
was
a
lie
i
would
be
telling
the
truth
even
now
if
if
i
had
come
to
the
end
of
my
rope
now
how
do
you
explain
that
how
can
it
be
explained
was
i
really
rotten
to
the
core
all
the
time
years
ago
when
i
seemed
to
everybody
myself
and
the
rest
to
be
good
and
straight
and
sincere
was
it
all
a
sham
or
does
god
take
a
good
man
and
turn
him
into
an
bad
one
in
just
a
few
months
in
the
time
that
it
takes
an
ear
of
corn
to
form
and
ripen
and
go
off
with
the
mildew
or
is
there
any
god
at
all
but
only
men
who
live
and
die
like
animals
and
that
would
explain
my
case
would
it
i
got
bitten
and
went
vicious
and
crazy
and
they
had
to
chase
me
out
and
hunt
me
to
my
death
like
a
mad
dog
yes
that
makes
it
all
very
simple
it
is
worth
while
to
discuss
me
at
all
as
if
i
had
a
soul
is
it
i
just
one
more
mongrel
cur
that
gone
mad
and
must
be
put
out
of
the
way
that
see
here
said
sister
soulsby
alertly
i
half
believe
that
a
good
cuffing
is
what
you
really
stand
in
need
of
now
you
stop
all
this
nonsense
and
lie
quiet
and
keep
still
do
you
hear
me
the
jocose
sternness
which
she
assumed
in
words
and
manner
seemed
to
soothe
him
he
almost
smiled
up
at
her
in
a
melancholy
way
and
sighed
profoundly
i
told
you
my
religion
before
she
went
on
with
gentleness
the
sheep
and
the
goats
are
to
be
separated
on
judgment
day
but
not
a
minute
sooner
in
other
words
as
long
as
human
life
lasts
good
bad
and
indifferent
are
all
braided
up
together
in
every
man
nature
and
every
woman
too
you
were
altogether
good
a
year
ago
any
more
than
you
altogether
bad
now
you
were
some
of
both
then
you
some
of
both
now
if
you
been
making
an
extra
sort
of
fool
of
yourself
lately
why
now
that
you
recognize
it
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
slow
steam
pull
up
and
back
engine
in
the
other
direction
in
that
way
you
find
things
will
even
themselves
up
it
a
with
all
of
us
theron
ware
sometimes
up
sometimes
down
but
nobody
is
rotten
clear
to
the
he
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
in
silence
for
a
time
this
is
what
day
of
the
week
he
asked
at
last
friday
the
wednesday
that
would
be
the
seventeenth
that
was
the
day
ordained
for
my
slaughter
on
that
morning
i
was
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
no
king
could
have
been
so
proud
and
confident
as
i
was
a
wonderful
romance
had
come
to
me
the
most
beautiful
young
woman
in
the
world
the
most
talented
too
was
waiting
for
me
an
express
train
was
carrying
me
to
her
and
it
could
go
fast
enough
to
keep
up
with
my
eagerness
she
was
very
rich
and
she
loved
me
and
we
were
to
live
in
eternal
summer
wherever
we
liked
on
a
big
beautiful
yacht
no
one
else
had
such
a
life
before
him
as
that
it
seemed
almost
too
good
for
me
but
i
thought
i
had
grown
and
developed
so
much
that
perhaps
i
would
be
worthy
of
it
oh
how
happy
i
was
i
tell
you
this
because
because
you
are
not
like
the
others
you
will
yes
i
understand
she
said
patiently
well
you
were
being
so
that
was
in
the
morning
wednesday
the
seventeenth
early
in
the
morning
there
was
a
little
girl
in
the
car
playing
with
some
buttons
and
when
i
tried
to
make
friends
with
her
she
looked
at
me
and
she
saw
right
at
a
glance
that
i
was
a
fool
of
the
mouths
of
babes
and
sucklings
you
know
she
was
the
first
to
find
it
out
it
began
like
that
early
in
the
morning
but
then
after
that
everybody
knew
it
they
had
only
to
look
at
me
and
they
said
this
is
a
fool
like
a
little
nasty
boy
we
wo
let
him
into
our
houses
we
find
him
a
bore
that
is
what
they
did
she
say
it
sister
soulsby
permitted
herself
to
ask
for
answer
theron
bit
his
lips
and
drew
his
chin
under
the
fur
and
pushed
his
scowling
face
into
the
pillow
the
spasmodic
gasps
began
to
shake
him
again
she
laid
a
compassionate
hand
upon
his
hot
brow
that
is
why
i
made
my
way
here
to
you
he
groaned
piteously
i
knew
you
would
sympathize
i
could
tell
it
all
to
you
and
it
was
so
awful
to
die
there
alone
in
the
strange
city
i
could
do
it
with
nobody
near
me
who
liked
me
or
thought
well
of
me
alice
would
hate
me
there
was
no
one
but
you
i
wanted
to
be
with
you
at
the
his
quavering
voice
broke
off
in
a
gust
of
weeping
and
his
face
frankly
surrendered
itself
to
the
distortions
of
a
crying
child
countenance
and
tragically
grotesque
in
its
abandonment
of
control
sister
soulsby
as
her
husband
boots
were
heard
descending
the
stairs
rose
and
drew
the
robe
up
to
half
cover
his
agonized
visage
she
patted
the
sufferer
softly
on
the
head
and
then
went
to
the
i
think
he
go
to
sleep
now
she
said
lifting
her
voice
to
the
and
with
a
backward
nod
toward
the
couch
come
out
into
the
kitchen
while
i
get
breakfast
or
into
the
or
somewhere
so
as
not
to
disturb
him
he
promised
me
to
lie
perfectly
quiet
and
try
to
when
they
had
passed
together
out
of
the
room
she
turned
soulsby
she
said
with
asperity
i
disappointed
in
you
for
a
man
who
knocked
about
as
much
as
you
have
i
must
say
you
picked
up
an
astonishingly
small
outfit
of
gumption
that
poor
creature
in
there
is
no
more
drunk
than
i
am
he
been
drinking
yes
drinking
like
a
fish
but
it
was
able
to
make
him
drunk
he
past
being
drunk
it
a
case
of
some
girl
has
made
a
fool
of
him
and
decoyed
him
up
in
a
balloon
and
let
him
drop
he
been
hurt
bad
we
have
all
been
hurt
in
our
day
and
generation
responded
brother
soulsby
genially
do
you
worry
he
sleep
that
off
too
it
takes
longer
than
drink
and
it
does
begin
to
be
so
pleasant
but
it
can
be
slept
off
take
my
word
for
it
he
be
a
different
man
by
when
noon
came
however
brother
soulsby
was
on
his
way
to
summon
one
of
the
village
doctors
toward
nightfall
he
went
out
again
to
telegraph
for
alice
chapter
xxxii
spring
fell
early
upon
the
pleasant
southern
slopes
of
the
susquehanna
country
the
snow
went
off
as
by
magic
the
trees
budded
and
leaved
before
their
time
the
birds
came
and
set
up
their
chorus
in
the
elms
while
winter
seemed
still
a
thing
of
yesterday
alice
clad
gravely
in
black
stood
again
upon
a
and
looked
across
an
intervening
space
of
and
fences
to
where
the
tall
boughs
fresh
in
their
new
verdure
were
silhouetted
against
the
pure
blue
sky
the
prospect
recalled
to
her
irresistibly
another
sunlit
morning
a
year
ago
when
she
had
stood
in
the
doorway
of
her
own
kitchen
and
surveyed
a
scene
not
unlike
this
it
might
have
been
with
the
same
carolling
robins
the
same
trees
the
same
azure
segment
of
the
tranquil
speckless
dome
then
she
was
looking
out
upon
surroundings
novel
and
strange
to
her
among
which
she
must
make
herself
at
home
as
best
she
could
but
at
least
the
ground
was
secure
under
her
feet
at
least
she
had
a
home
and
a
word
from
her
lips
could
summon
her
husband
out
to
stand
beside
her
with
his
arm
about
her
and
share
her
buoyant
hopeful
joy
in
the
promises
of
spring
to
think
that
that
was
only
one
little
year
ago
the
mere
revolution
of
four
brief
seasons
and
now
sister
soulsby
wiping
her
hands
on
her
apron
came
briskly
out
upon
the
stoop
some
cheerful
commonplace
was
on
her
tongue
but
a
glance
at
alice
wistful
face
kept
it
back
she
passed
an
arm
around
her
waist
instead
and
stood
in
silence
looking
at
the
elms
it
brings
back
memories
to
me
all
this
said
alice
nodding
her
head
and
not
seeking
to
dissemble
the
tears
which
sprang
to
her
eyes
the
men
will
be
down
in
a
minute
dear
the
other
reminded
her
they
nearly
finished
packing
before
i
put
the
biscuits
in
the
oven
we
must
wear
long
faces
before
folks
you
yes
i
know
murmured
alice
then
with
a
sudden
impulse
she
turned
to
her
companion
candace
she
said
fervently
we
alone
here
for
the
moment
i
must
tell
you
that
if
i
do
talk
gratitude
to
you
simply
and
solely
because
i
do
know
where
to
begin
or
what
to
say
i
just
dumfounded
at
your
goodness
it
takes
my
speech
away
i
only
know
this
candace
god
will
be
very
good
to
tut
tut
replied
sister
soulsby
that
all
right
you
dear
thing
i
know
just
how
you
feel
do
dream
of
being
under
obligation
to
explain
it
to
me
or
to
thank
us
at
all
we
had
all
sorts
of
comfort
out
of
the
thing
soulsby
and
i
we
used
to
get
downright
lonesome
here
all
by
ourselves
and
we
simply
had
a
winter
of
pleasant
company
instead
that
s
all
besides
there
solid
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
at
last
for
once
in
our
lives
we
had
a
chance
to
be
of
some
real
use
to
somebody
who
truly
needed
it
you
ca
imagine
how
stuck
up
that
makes
us
in
our
own
conceit
we
feel
as
if
we
were
george
peabody
and
lady
and
several
other
philanthropists
thrown
in
no
seriously
do
think
of
it
again
we
glad
to
have
been
able
to
do
it
all
and
if
you
only
go
ahead
now
and
prosper
and
be
happy
why
that
will
be
the
only
reward
we
i
hope
we
shall
do
well
said
alice
only
tell
me
this
candace
you
do
think
i
was
right
do
you
in
insisting
on
theron
leaving
the
ministry
altogether
he
seems
convinced
enough
now
that
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
but
i
grow
nervous
sometimes
lest
he
should
find
it
harder
than
he
thought
to
get
along
in
business
and
regret
the
change
and
blame
i
think
you
may
rest
easy
in
your
mind
about
that
the
other
responded
whatever
else
he
does
he
will
never
want
to
come
within
gunshot
of
a
pulpit
again
it
came
too
near
murdering
him
for
alice
looked
at
her
doubtfully
something
came
near
murdering
him
i
know
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
i
would
say
it
was
the
ministry
and
i
guess
you
know
pretty
well
yourself
what
it
was
of
course
never
asked
any
questions
and
i
hushed
up
everybody
at
octavius
who
tried
to
quiz
me
about
it
his
disappearance
and
my
packing
up
and
leaving
and
all
that
and
i
never
discussed
the
question
with
you
but
no
and
there
no
good
going
into
it
now
put
in
sister
soulsby
with
amiable
decisiveness
it
all
past
and
gone
in
fact
i
hardly
remember
much
about
it
now
myself
he
simply
got
into
deep
water
poor
soul
and
we
floated
him
out
again
safe
and
sound
that
all
but
all
the
same
i
was
right
in
what
i
said
he
was
a
mistake
in
the
but
if
you
known
him
in
previous
years
urged
alice
plaintively
before
we
were
sent
to
that
awful
octavius
he
was
the
very
ideal
of
all
a
young
minister
should
be
people
used
to
simply
worship
him
he
was
such
a
perfect
preacher
and
so
and
friendly
with
everybody
and
threw
himself
into
his
work
so
it
was
all
that
miserable
contemptible
octavius
that
did
the
sister
soulsby
slowly
shook
her
head
if
there
had
been
a
screw
loose
somewhere
she
said
gently
octavius
would
have
hurt
him
no
take
my
word
for
it
he
never
was
the
right
man
for
the
place
he
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
but
he
was
when
pressure
was
put
on
him
it
found
out
his
weak
spot
like
a
shot
and
pushed
on
it
and
well
it
came
near
smashing
him
that
and
do
you
think
he
always
be
a
a
mourned
alice
for
mercy
sake
do
ever
try
to
have
him
pretend
to
be
anything
else
exclaimed
the
other
the
last
state
of
that
man
would
be
worse
than
the
first
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
that
and
you
must
show
that
you
nervous
about
it
you
must
get
nervous
you
must
be
afraid
of
things
just
you
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
and
say
you
will
get
along
you
will
be
happy
that
your
only
chance
alice
he
is
going
to
be
an
angel
of
light
or
a
saint
or
anything
of
that
sort
and
no
good
expecting
it
but
he
be
just
an
average
kind
of
man
a
little
sore
about
some
things
a
little
wiser
than
he
was
about
some
others
you
can
get
along
perfectly
with
him
if
you
only
keep
your
courage
up
and
do
show
the
white
yes
i
know
but
i
had
it
pretty
well
taken
out
of
me
commented
alice
it
used
to
come
easy
to
me
to
be
cheerful
and
resolute
and
all
that
but
it
different
sister
soulsby
stole
a
swift
glance
at
the
unsuspecting
face
of
her
companion
which
was
not
all
admiration
but
her
voice
remained
patiently
affectionate
oh
that
all
come
back
to
you
right
enough
have
your
hands
full
you
know
finding
a
house
and
unpacking
all
your
old
furniture
and
buying
new
things
and
getting
your
home
settled
it
keep
you
so
busy
you
wo
have
time
to
feel
strange
or
lonesome
one
bit
you
see
how
it
tone
you
up
in
a
year
time
you
know
yourself
in
the
oh
my
health
is
good
enough
said
alice
but
i
ca
help
thinking
suppose
theron
should
be
taken
sick
again
away
out
there
among
strangers
you
know
he
never
appeared
to
me
to
have
quite
got
his
strength
back
these
long
illnesses
you
know
they
always
leave
a
mark
on
a
nonsense
he
strong
as
an
ox
insisted
sister
soulsby
you
mark
my
word
he
thrive
in
seattle
like
a
green
seattle
echoed
alice
meditatively
it
sounds
like
the
other
end
of
the
world
does
it
the
noise
of
feet
in
the
house
broke
upon
the
colloquy
and
the
women
went
indoors
to
join
the
breakfast
party
during
the
meal
it
was
brother
soulsby
who
bore
the
burden
of
the
conversation
he
was
full
of
the
future
of
seattle
and
the
magnificent
impending
development
of
that
pacific
section
he
had
been
out
there
years
ago
when
it
was
next
door
to
uninhabited
he
had
visited
the
district
twice
since
and
the
changes
discoverable
each
new
time
were
more
wonderful
than
anything
lamp
ever
wrought
he
had
secured
for
theron
through
some
of
his
friends
in
portland
the
superintendency
of
a
land
and
real
estate
company
which
had
its
headquarters
in
seattle
but
ambitiously
linked
its
affairs
with
the
future
of
all
washington
territory
in
an
time
the
hack
would
come
to
take
the
wares
and
their
baggage
to
the
depot
the
first
stage
in
their
long
journey
across
the
continent
to
their
new
home
brother
soulsby
amiably
filled
the
interval
with
reminiscences
of
the
oregon
of
twenty
years
back
with
instructive
dissertations
upon
the
soil
climate
and
seasons
of
puget
sound
and
the
columbia
valley
and
above
all
with
helpful
characterizations
of
the
social
life
which
had
begun
to
take
form
in
this
remotest
west
he
had
nothing
but
confidence
to
all
appearances
in
the
success
of
his
young
friend
now
embarking
on
this
new
career
he
seemed
so
sanguine
about
it
that
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
breakfast
room
lightened
up
and
the
parting
meal
surrounded
by
so
many
temptations
to
distraught
broodings
and
silences
as
it
was
became
almost
jovial
in
its
spirit
at
last
it
was
time
to
look
for
the
carriage
the
trunks
and
were
ready
in
the
hall
and
sister
soulsby
was
tying
up
a
package
of
sandwiches
for
alice
to
keep
by
her
in
the
train
theron
with
hat
in
hand
and
overcoat
on
arm
loitered
restlessly
into
the
kitchen
and
watched
this
proceeding
for
a
moment
then
he
sauntered
out
upon
the
stoop
and
lifting
his
head
and
drawing
as
long
a
breath
as
he
could
looked
over
at
the
elms
perhaps
the
face
was
older
and
graver
it
was
hard
to
tell
the
long
winter
illness
with
its
recurring
crises
and
sustained
confinement
had
bleached
his
skin
and
reduced
his
figure
to
gauntness
but
there
was
none
the
less
an
air
of
restored
and
secure
good
health
about
him
only
in
the
eyes
themselves
as
they
rested
briefly
upon
the
prospect
did
a
substantial
change
suggest
itself
they
did
not
dwell
fondly
upon
the
picture
of
the
lofty
spreading
boughs
with
their
waves
of
leafage
stirring
against
the
blue
they
did
not
soften
and
glow
this
time
at
the
thought
of
how
wholly
one
felt
sure
of
god
goodness
in
these
wonderful
new
mornings
of
spring
they
looked
instead
straight
through
the
fairest
and
most
moving
spectacle
in
nature
processional
and
saw
afar
off
in
conjectural
vision
a
formless
sort
of
place
which
was
seattle
they
surveyed
its
impalpable
outlines
its
undefined
dimensions
with
a
certain
cool
glitter
of
resolve
there
rose
before
his
fancy
out
of
the
chaos
of
these
shapeless
imaginings
some
faces
of
men
then
more
behind
them
then
a
great
concourse
of
uplifted
countenances
crowded
close
together
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
they
were
attentive
faces
all
rapt
eager
credulous
to
a
degree
their
eyes
were
admiringly
bent
upon
a
common
object
of
excited
interest
they
were
looking
at
him
they
strained
their
ears
to
miss
no
cadence
of
his
voice
involuntarily
he
straightened
himself
stretched
forth
his
hand
with
the
pale
thin
fingers
gracefully
disposed
and
passed
it
slowly
before
him
from
side
to
side
in
a
comprehensive
stately
gesture
the
audience
rose
at
him
as
he
dropped
his
hand
and
filled
his
with
a
mighty
roar
of
applause
in
volume
like
an
ocean
tempest
yet
pitched
for
his
hearing
alone
he
smiled
shook
himself
with
a
little
delighted
tremor
and
turned
on
the
stoop
to
the
open
door
what
soulsby
said
about
politics
out
there
interested
me
enormously
he
remarked
to
the
two
women
i
should
be
surprised
if
i
found
myself
doing
something
in
that
line
i
can
speak
you
know
if
i
do
anything
else
talk
is
what
tells
these
days
who
knows
i
may
turn
up
in
washington
a
senator
before
i
forty
stranger
things
have
happened
than
that
out
west
we
come
down
and
visit
you
then
soulsby
and
i
said
sister
soulsby
cheerfully
you
shall
take
us
to
the
white
house
alice
and
introduce
oh
it
is
likely
i
would
come
east
said
alice
pensively
most
probably
i
be
left
to
amuse
myself
in
seattle
but
there
i
think
that
the
carriage
driving
up
to
the
door
