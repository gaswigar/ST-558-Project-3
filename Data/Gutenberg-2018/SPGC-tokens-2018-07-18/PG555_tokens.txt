chapter
i
francesca
bassington
sat
in
the
of
her
house
in
blue
street
regaling
herself
and
her
estimable
brother
henry
with
china
tea
and
small
cress
sandwiches
the
meal
was
of
that
elegant
proportion
which
while
ministering
sympathetically
to
the
desires
of
the
moment
is
happily
reminiscent
of
a
satisfactory
luncheon
and
blessedly
expectant
of
an
elaborate
dinner
to
come
in
her
younger
days
francesca
had
been
known
as
the
beautiful
miss
greech
at
forty
although
much
of
the
original
beauty
remained
she
was
just
dear
francesca
bassington
no
one
would
have
dreamed
of
calling
her
sweet
but
a
good
many
people
who
scarcely
knew
her
were
punctilious
about
putting
in
the
her
enemies
in
their
honester
moments
would
have
admitted
that
she
was
svelte
and
knew
how
to
dress
but
they
would
have
agreed
with
her
friends
in
asserting
that
she
had
no
soul
when
one
s
friends
and
enemies
agree
on
any
particular
point
they
are
usually
wrong
francesca
herself
if
pressed
in
an
unguarded
moment
to
describe
her
soul
would
probably
have
described
her
not
that
she
would
have
considered
that
the
one
had
stamped
the
impress
of
its
character
on
the
other
so
that
close
scrutiny
might
reveal
its
outstanding
features
and
even
suggest
its
hidden
places
but
because
she
might
have
dimly
recognised
that
her
was
her
soul
francesca
was
one
of
those
women
towards
whom
fate
appears
to
have
the
best
intentions
and
never
to
carry
them
into
practice
with
the
advantages
put
at
her
disposal
she
might
have
been
expected
to
command
a
more
than
average
share
of
feminine
happiness
so
many
of
the
things
that
make
for
fretfulness
disappointment
and
discouragement
in
a
woman
s
life
were
removed
from
her
path
that
she
might
well
have
been
considered
the
fortunate
miss
greech
or
later
lucky
francesca
bassington
and
she
was
not
of
the
perverse
band
of
those
who
make
a
of
their
souls
by
dragging
into
them
all
the
stoney
griefs
and
unclaimed
troubles
they
can
find
lying
around
them
francesca
loved
the
smooth
ways
and
pleasant
places
of
life
she
liked
not
merely
to
look
on
the
bright
side
of
things
but
to
live
there
and
stay
there
and
the
fact
that
things
had
at
one
time
and
another
gone
badly
with
her
and
cheated
her
of
some
of
her
early
illusions
made
her
cling
the
closer
to
such
good
fortune
as
remained
to
her
now
that
she
seemed
to
have
reached
a
calmer
period
of
her
life
to
undiscriminating
friends
she
appeared
in
the
guise
of
a
rather
selfish
woman
but
it
was
merely
the
selfishness
of
one
who
had
seen
the
happy
and
unhappy
sides
of
life
and
wished
to
enjoy
to
the
utmost
what
was
left
to
her
of
the
former
the
vicissitudes
of
fortune
had
not
soured
her
but
they
had
perhaps
narrowed
her
in
the
sense
of
making
her
concentrate
much
of
her
sympathies
on
things
that
immediately
pleased
and
amused
her
or
that
recalled
and
perpetuated
the
pleasing
and
successful
incidents
of
other
days
and
it
was
her
in
particular
that
enshrined
the
memorials
or
tokens
of
past
and
present
happiness
into
that
comfortable
room
of
angles
and
bays
and
alcoves
had
sailed
as
into
a
harbour
those
precious
personal
possessions
and
trophies
that
had
survived
the
buffetings
and
storms
of
a
not
very
tranquil
married
life
wherever
her
eyes
might
turn
she
saw
the
embodied
results
of
her
successes
economies
good
luck
good
management
or
good
taste
the
battle
had
more
than
once
gone
against
her
but
she
had
somehow
always
contrived
to
save
her
baggage
train
and
her
complacent
gaze
could
roam
over
object
after
object
that
represented
the
spoils
of
victory
or
the
salvage
of
honourable
defeat
the
delicious
bronze
fremiet
on
the
mantelpiece
had
been
the
outcome
of
a
grand
prix
sweepstake
of
many
years
ago
a
group
of
dresden
figures
of
some
considerable
value
had
been
bequeathed
to
her
by
a
discreet
admirer
who
had
added
death
to
his
other
kindnesses
another
group
had
been
a
present
purchased
in
blessed
and
unfading
memory
of
a
wonderful
bridge
winnings
at
a
party
there
were
old
persian
and
bokharan
rugs
and
worcester
of
glowing
colour
and
little
treasures
of
antique
silver
that
each
enshrined
a
history
or
a
memory
in
addition
to
its
own
intrinsic
value
it
amused
her
at
times
to
think
of
the
bygone
craftsmen
and
artificers
who
had
hammered
and
wrought
and
woven
in
far
distant
countries
and
ages
to
produce
the
wonderful
and
beautiful
things
that
had
come
one
way
and
another
into
her
possession
workers
in
the
studios
of
medieval
italian
towns
and
of
later
paris
in
the
bazaars
of
baghdad
and
of
central
asia
in
english
workshops
and
german
factories
in
all
manner
of
queer
hidden
corners
where
craft
secrets
were
jealously
guarded
nameless
unremembered
men
and
men
whose
names
were
and
deathless
and
above
all
her
other
treasures
dominating
in
her
estimation
every
other
object
that
the
room
contained
was
the
great
van
der
meulen
that
had
come
from
her
father
s
home
as
part
of
her
wedding
dowry
it
fitted
exactly
into
the
central
wall
panel
above
the
narrow
buhl
cabinet
and
filled
exactly
its
right
space
in
the
composition
and
balance
of
the
room
from
wherever
you
sat
it
seemed
to
confront
you
as
the
dominating
feature
of
its
surroundings
there
was
a
pleasing
serenity
about
the
great
pompous
battle
scene
with
its
solemn
courtly
warriors
bestriding
their
heavily
prancing
steeds
grey
or
skewbald
or
dun
all
gravely
in
earnest
and
yet
somehow
conveying
the
impression
that
their
campaigns
were
but
vast
serious
picnics
arranged
in
the
grand
manner
francesca
could
not
imagine
the
without
the
crowning
complement
of
the
stately
picture
just
as
she
could
not
imagine
herself
in
any
other
setting
than
this
house
in
blue
street
with
its
crowded
pantheon
of
cherished
household
gods
and
herein
sprouted
one
of
the
thorns
that
obtruded
through
the
damask
of
what
might
otherwise
have
been
francesca
s
peace
of
mind
one
s
happiness
always
lies
in
the
future
rather
than
in
the
past
with
due
deference
to
an
esteemed
lyrical
authority
one
may
safely
say
that
a
sorrow
s
crown
of
sorrow
is
anticipating
unhappier
things
the
house
in
blue
street
had
been
left
to
her
by
her
old
friend
sophie
chetrof
but
only
until
such
time
as
her
niece
emmeline
chetrof
should
marry
when
it
was
to
pass
to
her
as
a
wedding
present
emmeline
was
now
seventeen
and
passably
and
four
or
five
years
were
all
that
could
be
safely
allotted
to
the
span
of
her
continued
spinsterhood
beyond
that
period
lay
chaos
the
wrenching
asunder
of
francesca
from
the
sheltering
habitation
that
had
grown
to
be
her
soul
it
is
true
that
in
imagination
she
had
built
herself
a
bridge
across
the
chasm
a
bridge
of
a
single
span
the
bridge
in
question
was
her
schoolboy
son
comus
now
being
educated
somewhere
in
the
southern
counties
or
rather
one
should
say
the
bridge
consisted
of
the
possibility
of
his
eventual
marriage
with
emmeline
in
which
case
francesca
saw
herself
still
reigning
a
trifle
squeezed
and
incommoded
perhaps
but
still
reigning
in
the
house
in
blue
street
the
van
der
meulen
would
still
catch
its
requisite
afternoon
light
in
its
place
of
honour
the
fremiet
and
the
dresden
and
old
worcester
would
continue
undisturbed
in
their
accustomed
niches
emmeline
could
have
the
japanese
snuggery
where
francesca
sometimes
drank
her
coffee
as
a
separate
where
she
could
put
her
own
things
the
details
of
the
bridge
structure
had
all
been
carefully
thought
out
was
an
unfortunate
circumstance
that
comus
should
have
been
the
span
on
which
everything
balanced
francesca
s
husband
had
insisted
on
giving
the
boy
that
strange
pagan
name
and
had
not
lived
long
enough
to
judge
as
to
the
appropriateness
or
otherwise
of
its
significance
in
seventeen
years
and
some
odd
months
francesca
had
had
ample
opportunity
for
forming
an
opinion
concerning
her
son
s
characteristics
the
spirit
of
mirthfulness
which
one
associates
with
the
name
certainly
ran
riot
in
the
boy
but
it
was
a
twisted
wayward
sort
of
mirth
of
which
francesca
herself
could
seldom
see
the
humorous
side
in
her
brother
henry
who
sat
eating
small
cress
sandwiches
as
solemnly
as
though
they
had
been
ordained
in
some
immemorial
book
of
observances
fate
had
been
undisguisedly
kind
to
her
he
might
so
easily
have
married
some
pretty
helpless
little
woman
and
lived
at
notting
hill
gate
and
been
the
father
of
a
long
string
of
pale
clever
useless
children
who
would
have
had
birthdays
and
the
sort
of
illnesses
that
one
is
expected
to
send
grapes
to
and
who
would
have
painted
fatuous
objects
in
a
south
kensington
manner
as
christmas
offerings
to
an
aunt
whose
cubic
space
for
lumber
was
limited
instead
of
committing
these
unbrotherly
actions
which
are
so
frequent
in
family
life
that
they
might
almost
be
called
brotherly
henry
had
married
a
woman
who
had
both
money
and
a
sense
of
repose
and
their
one
child
had
the
brilliant
virtue
of
never
saying
anything
which
even
its
parents
could
consider
worth
repeating
then
he
had
gone
into
parliament
possibly
with
the
idea
of
making
his
home
life
seem
less
dull
at
any
rate
it
redeemed
his
career
from
insignificance
for
no
man
whose
death
can
produce
the
item
another
on
the
news
posters
can
be
wholly
a
nonentity
henry
in
short
who
might
have
been
an
embarrassment
and
a
handicap
had
chosen
rather
to
be
a
friend
and
counsellor
at
times
even
an
emergency
bank
balance
francesca
on
her
part
with
the
partiality
which
a
clever
and
woman
often
feels
for
a
reliable
fool
not
only
sought
his
counsel
but
frequently
followed
it
when
convenient
moreover
she
repaid
his
loans
against
this
good
service
on
the
part
of
fate
in
providing
her
with
henry
for
a
brother
francesca
could
well
set
the
plaguy
malice
of
the
destiny
that
had
given
her
comus
for
a
son
the
boy
was
one
of
those
untameable
young
lords
of
misrule
that
frolic
and
chafe
themselves
through
nursery
and
preparatory
and
days
with
the
utmost
allowance
of
storm
and
dust
and
dislocation
and
the
least
possible
amount
of
and
come
somehow
with
a
laugh
through
a
series
of
catastrophes
that
has
reduced
everyone
else
concerned
to
tears
or
forebodings
sometimes
they
sober
down
in
and
become
uninteresting
forgetting
that
they
were
ever
lords
of
anything
sometimes
fate
plays
royally
into
their
hands
and
they
do
great
things
in
a
spacious
manner
and
are
thanked
by
parliaments
and
the
press
and
acclaimed
by
crowds
but
in
most
cases
their
tragedy
begins
when
they
leave
school
and
turn
themselves
loose
in
a
world
that
has
grown
too
civilised
and
too
crowded
and
too
empty
to
have
any
place
for
them
and
they
are
very
many
henry
greech
had
made
an
end
of
biting
small
sandwiches
and
settled
down
like
a
refreshed
to
discuss
one
of
the
fashionably
prevalent
topics
of
the
moment
the
prevention
of
destitution
it
is
a
question
that
is
only
being
nibbled
at
smelt
at
one
might
say
at
the
present
moment
he
observed
but
it
is
one
that
will
have
to
engage
our
serious
attention
and
consideration
before
long
the
first
thing
that
we
shall
have
to
do
is
to
get
out
of
the
dilettante
and
academic
way
of
approaching
it
we
must
collect
and
assimilate
hard
facts
it
is
a
subject
that
ought
to
appeal
to
all
thinking
minds
and
yet
you
know
i
find
it
surprisingly
difficult
to
interest
people
in
francesca
made
some
monosyllabic
response
a
sort
of
sympathetic
grunt
which
was
meant
to
indicate
that
she
was
to
a
certain
extent
listening
and
appreciating
in
reality
she
was
reflecting
that
henry
possibly
found
it
difficult
to
interest
people
in
any
topic
that
he
enlarged
on
his
talents
lay
so
thoroughly
in
the
direction
of
being
uninteresting
that
even
as
an
of
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
he
would
probably
have
infused
a
flavour
of
boredom
into
his
descriptions
of
the
event
i
was
speaking
down
in
leicestershire
the
other
day
on
this
subject
continued
henry
and
i
pointed
out
at
some
length
a
thing
that
few
people
ever
stop
to
francesca
went
over
immediately
but
decorously
to
the
majority
that
will
not
stop
to
consider
did
you
come
across
any
of
the
barnets
when
you
were
down
there
she
interrupted
eliza
barnet
is
rather
taken
up
with
all
those
in
the
propagandist
movements
of
sociology
as
in
other
arenas
of
life
and
struggle
the
fiercest
competition
and
rivalry
is
frequently
to
be
found
between
closely
allied
types
and
species
eliza
barnet
shared
many
of
henry
greech
s
political
and
social
views
but
she
also
shared
his
fondness
for
pointing
things
out
at
some
length
there
had
been
occasions
when
she
had
extensively
occupied
the
strictly
limited
span
allotted
to
the
platform
oratory
of
a
group
of
speakers
of
whom
henry
greech
had
been
an
impatient
unit
he
might
see
eye
to
eye
with
her
on
the
leading
questions
of
the
day
but
he
persistently
wore
mental
blinkers
as
far
as
her
estimable
qualities
were
concerned
and
the
mention
of
her
name
was
a
skilful
lure
drawn
across
the
trail
of
his
discourse
if
francesca
had
to
listen
to
his
eloquence
on
any
subject
she
much
preferred
that
it
should
be
a
disparagement
of
eliza
barnet
rather
than
the
prevention
of
destitution
i
ve
no
doubt
she
means
well
said
henry
but
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
she
could
be
induced
to
keep
her
own
personality
a
little
more
in
the
background
and
not
to
imagine
that
she
is
the
necessary
mouthpiece
of
all
the
progressive
thought
in
the
countryside
i
fancy
canon
besomley
must
have
had
her
in
his
mind
when
he
said
that
some
people
came
into
the
world
to
shake
empires
and
others
to
move
francesca
laughed
with
genuine
amusement
i
suppose
she
is
really
wonderfully
well
up
in
all
the
subjects
she
talks
about
was
her
provocative
comment
henry
grew
possibly
conscious
of
the
fact
that
he
was
being
drawn
out
on
the
subject
of
eliza
barnet
and
he
presently
turned
on
to
a
more
personal
topic
from
the
general
air
of
tranquillity
about
the
house
i
presume
comus
has
gone
back
to
thaleby
he
observed
yes
said
francesca
he
went
back
yesterday
of
course
i
m
very
fond
of
him
but
i
bear
the
separation
well
when
he
s
here
it
s
rather
like
having
a
live
volcano
in
the
house
a
volcano
that
in
its
quietest
moments
asks
incessant
questions
and
uses
strong
it
is
only
a
temporary
respite
said
henry
in
a
year
or
two
he
will
be
leaving
school
and
then
what
francesca
closed
her
eyes
with
the
air
of
one
who
seeks
to
shut
out
a
distressing
vision
she
was
not
fond
of
looking
intimately
at
the
future
in
the
presence
of
another
person
especially
when
the
future
was
draped
in
doubtfully
auspicious
colours
and
then
what
persisted
henry
then
i
suppose
he
will
be
upon
my
don
t
sit
there
looking
judicial
i
m
quite
ready
to
listen
to
suggestions
if
you
ve
any
to
in
the
case
of
any
ordinary
boy
said
henry
i
might
make
lots
of
suggestions
as
to
the
finding
of
suitable
employment
from
what
we
know
of
comus
it
would
be
rather
a
waste
of
time
for
either
of
us
to
look
for
jobs
which
he
wouldn
t
look
at
when
we
d
got
them
for
he
must
do
something
said
francesca
i
know
he
must
but
he
never
will
at
least
he
ll
never
stick
to
anything
the
most
hopeful
thing
to
do
with
him
will
be
to
marry
him
to
an
heiress
that
would
solve
the
financial
side
of
his
problem
if
he
had
unlimited
money
at
his
disposal
he
might
go
into
the
wilds
somewhere
and
shoot
big
game
i
never
know
what
the
big
game
have
done
to
deserve
it
but
they
do
help
to
deflect
the
destructive
energies
of
some
of
our
social
henry
who
never
killed
anything
larger
or
fiercer
than
a
trout
was
scornfully
superior
on
the
subject
of
big
game
shooting
francesca
brightened
at
the
matrimonial
suggestion
i
don
t
know
about
an
heiress
she
said
reflectively
there
s
emmeline
chetrof
of
course
one
could
hardly
call
her
an
heiress
but
she
s
got
a
comfortable
little
income
of
her
own
and
i
suppose
something
more
will
come
to
her
from
her
grandmother
then
of
course
you
know
this
house
goes
to
her
when
she
that
would
be
very
convenient
said
henry
probably
following
a
line
of
thought
that
his
sister
had
trodden
many
hundreds
of
times
before
him
do
she
and
comus
hit
it
off
at
all
well
together
oh
well
enough
in
boy
and
girl
fashion
said
francesca
i
must
arrange
for
them
to
see
more
of
each
other
in
future
by
the
way
that
little
brother
of
hers
that
she
dotes
on
lancelot
goes
to
thaleby
this
term
i
ll
write
and
tell
comus
to
be
specially
kind
to
him
that
will
be
a
sure
way
to
emmeline
s
heart
comus
has
been
made
a
prefect
you
know
heaven
knows
it
can
only
be
for
prominence
in
games
sniffed
henry
i
think
we
may
safely
leave
work
and
conduct
out
of
the
comus
was
not
a
favourite
with
his
uncle
francesca
had
turned
to
her
writing
cabinet
and
was
hastily
scribbling
a
letter
to
her
son
in
which
the
delicate
health
timid
disposition
and
other
inevitable
attributes
of
the
new
boy
were
brought
to
his
notice
and
commanded
to
his
care
when
she
had
sealed
and
stamped
the
envelope
henry
uttered
a
belated
caution
perhaps
on
the
whole
it
would
be
wiser
to
say
nothing
about
the
boy
to
comus
he
doesn
t
always
respond
to
directions
you
francesca
did
know
and
already
was
more
than
half
of
her
brother
s
opinion
but
the
woman
who
can
sacrifice
a
clean
unspoiled
penny
stamp
is
probably
yet
unborn
chapter
ii
lancelot
chetrof
stood
at
the
end
of
a
long
bare
passage
restlessly
consulting
his
watch
and
fervently
wishing
himself
half
an
hour
older
with
a
certain
painful
experience
already
registered
in
the
past
unfortunately
it
still
belonged
to
the
future
and
what
was
still
more
horrible
to
the
immediate
future
like
many
boys
new
to
a
school
he
had
cultivated
an
unhealthy
passion
for
obeying
rules
and
requirements
and
his
zeal
in
this
direction
had
proved
his
undoing
in
his
hurry
to
be
doing
two
or
three
estimable
things
at
once
he
had
omitted
to
study
the
in
more
than
a
perfunctory
fashion
and
had
thereby
missed
a
football
practice
specially
ordained
for
boys
his
fellow
juniors
of
a
term
s
longer
standing
had
graphically
enlightened
him
as
to
the
inevitable
consequences
of
his
lapse
the
dread
which
attaches
to
the
unknown
was
at
any
rate
deleted
from
his
approaching
doom
though
at
the
moment
he
felt
scarcely
grateful
for
the
knowledge
placed
at
his
disposal
with
such
lavish
solicitude
you
ll
get
six
of
the
very
best
over
the
back
of
a
chair
said
one
they
ll
draw
a
chalk
line
across
you
of
course
you
know
said
another
a
chalk
line
rather
so
that
every
cut
can
be
aimed
exactly
at
the
same
spot
it
hurts
much
more
that
lancelot
tried
to
nourish
a
wan
hope
that
there
might
be
an
element
of
exaggeration
in
this
uncomfortably
realistic
description
meanwhile
in
the
prefects
room
at
the
other
end
of
the
passage
comus
bassington
and
a
fellow
prefect
sat
also
waiting
on
time
but
in
a
mood
of
far
more
pleasurable
expectancy
comus
was
one
of
the
most
junior
of
the
prefect
caste
but
by
no
means
the
least
and
outside
the
masters
he
enjoyed
a
certain
fitful
popularity
or
at
any
rate
admiration
at
football
he
was
too
erratic
to
be
a
really
brilliant
player
but
he
tackled
as
if
the
act
of
bringing
his
man
headlong
to
the
ground
was
in
itself
a
sensuous
pleasure
and
his
weird
whenever
he
got
hurt
were
eagerly
treasured
by
those
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
hear
them
at
athletics
in
general
he
was
a
showy
performer
and
although
new
to
the
functions
of
a
prefect
he
had
already
established
a
reputation
as
an
effective
and
artistic
caner
in
appearance
he
exactly
fitted
his
fanciful
pagan
name
his
large
eyes
seemed
for
ever
asparkle
with
goblin
mischief
and
the
joy
of
revelry
and
the
curved
lips
might
have
been
those
of
some
faun
one
almost
expected
to
see
embryo
horns
fretting
the
smoothness
of
his
sleek
dark
hair
the
chin
was
firm
but
one
looked
in
vain
for
a
redeeming
touch
of
in
the
handsome
face
with
a
strain
of
sourness
in
him
comus
might
have
been
leavened
into
something
creative
and
masterful
fate
had
fashioned
him
with
a
certain
whimsical
charm
and
left
him
all
unequipped
for
the
greater
purposes
of
life
perhaps
no
one
would
have
called
him
a
lovable
character
but
in
many
respects
he
was
adorable
in
all
respects
he
was
certainly
damned
rutley
his
companion
of
the
moment
sat
watching
him
and
wondering
from
the
depths
of
a
very
ordinary
brain
whether
he
liked
or
hated
him
it
was
easy
to
do
either
it
s
not
really
your
turn
to
cane
he
said
i
know
it
s
not
said
comus
fingering
a
very
cane
as
lovingly
as
a
pious
violinist
might
handle
his
strad
i
gave
greyson
some
to
let
me
toss
whether
i
caned
or
him
and
i
won
he
was
rather
decent
over
it
and
let
me
have
half
the
chocolate
the
droll
lightheartedness
which
won
comus
bassington
such
measure
of
popularity
as
he
enjoyed
among
his
fellows
did
not
materially
help
to
endear
him
to
the
succession
of
masters
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
during
the
course
of
his
schooldays
he
amused
and
interested
such
of
them
as
had
the
saving
grace
of
humour
at
their
disposal
but
if
they
sighed
when
he
passed
from
their
immediate
responsibility
it
was
a
sigh
of
relief
rather
than
of
regret
the
more
enlightened
and
experienced
of
them
realised
that
he
was
something
outside
the
scope
of
the
things
that
they
were
called
upon
to
deal
with
a
man
who
has
been
trained
to
cope
with
storms
to
foresee
their
coming
and
to
minimise
their
consequences
may
be
pardoned
if
he
feels
a
certain
reluctance
to
measure
himself
against
a
tornado
men
of
more
limited
outlook
and
with
a
correspondingly
larger
belief
in
their
own
powers
were
ready
to
tackle
the
tornado
had
time
permitted
i
think
i
could
tame
young
bassington
if
i
had
your
opportunities
a
once
remarked
to
a
colleague
whose
house
had
the
embarrassing
distinction
of
numbering
comus
among
its
inmates
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
try
replied
the
housemaster
but
why
asked
the
reformer
because
nature
hates
any
interference
with
her
own
arrangements
and
if
you
start
in
to
tame
the
obviously
untameable
you
are
taking
a
fearful
responsibility
on
nonsense
boys
are
nature
s
raw
millions
of
boys
are
there
are
just
a
few
and
bassington
is
one
of
them
who
are
nature
s
highly
finished
product
when
they
are
in
the
schoolboy
stage
and
we
who
are
supposed
to
be
moulding
raw
material
are
quite
helpless
when
we
come
in
contact
with
but
what
happens
to
them
when
they
grow
up
they
never
do
grow
up
said
the
housemaster
that
is
their
tragedy
bassington
will
certainly
never
grow
out
of
his
present
now
you
are
talking
in
the
language
of
peter
pan
said
the
i
am
not
thinking
in
the
manner
of
peter
pan
said
the
other
with
all
reverence
for
the
author
of
that
masterpiece
i
should
say
he
had
a
wonderful
and
tender
insight
into
the
child
mind
and
knew
nothing
whatever
about
boys
to
make
only
one
criticism
on
that
particular
work
can
you
imagine
a
lot
of
british
boys
or
boys
of
any
country
that
one
knows
of
who
would
stay
contentedly
playing
children
s
games
in
an
underground
cave
when
there
were
wolves
and
pirates
and
red
indians
to
be
had
for
the
asking
on
the
other
side
of
the
trap
door
the
laughed
you
evidently
think
that
the
boy
who
would
not
grow
up
must
have
been
written
by
a
who
could
never
have
been
a
perhaps
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
i
daresay
you
re
right
in
your
criticism
but
i
don
t
agree
with
you
about
bassington
he
s
a
handful
to
deal
with
as
anyone
knows
who
has
come
in
contact
with
him
but
if
one
s
hands
weren
t
full
with
a
thousand
and
one
other
things
i
hold
to
my
opinion
that
he
could
be
and
he
went
his
way
having
maintained
a
s
inalienable
privilege
of
being
in
the
right
in
the
prefects
room
comus
busied
himself
with
the
exact
position
of
a
chair
planted
out
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
i
think
everything
s
ready
he
said
rutley
glanced
at
the
clock
with
the
air
of
a
roman
elegant
in
the
circus
languidly
awaiting
the
introduction
of
an
expected
christian
to
an
expectant
tiger
the
kid
is
due
in
two
minutes
he
said
he
d
jolly
well
better
not
be
late
said
comus
comus
had
gone
through
the
mill
of
many
scorching
castigations
in
his
earlier
school
days
and
was
able
to
appreciate
to
the
last
ounce
the
panic
that
must
be
now
possessing
his
foredoomed
victim
probably
at
this
moment
hovering
miserably
outside
the
door
after
all
that
was
part
of
the
fun
of
the
thing
and
most
things
have
their
amusing
side
if
one
knows
where
to
look
for
it
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
lancelot
entered
in
response
to
a
hearty
friendly
summons
to
come
i
ve
come
to
be
caned
he
said
breathlessly
adding
by
way
of
identification
my
name
s
that
s
quite
bad
enough
in
itself
said
comus
but
there
is
probably
worse
to
follow
you
are
evidently
keeping
something
back
from
i
missed
a
footer
practice
said
lancelot
six
said
comus
briefly
picking
up
his
cane
i
didn
t
see
the
notice
on
the
board
hazarded
lancelot
as
a
forlorn
hope
we
are
always
pleased
to
listen
to
excuses
and
our
charge
is
two
extra
cuts
that
will
be
eight
get
and
comus
indicated
the
chair
that
stood
in
sinister
isolation
in
the
middle
of
the
room
never
had
an
article
of
furniture
seemed
more
hateful
in
lancelot
s
eyes
comus
could
well
remember
the
time
when
a
chair
stuck
in
the
middle
of
a
room
had
seemed
to
him
the
most
horrible
of
manufactured
things
lend
me
a
piece
of
chalk
he
said
to
his
brother
prefect
lancelot
ruefully
recognised
the
truth
of
the
story
comus
drew
the
desired
line
with
an
anxious
exactitude
which
he
would
have
scorned
to
apply
to
a
diagram
of
euclid
or
a
map
of
the
frontier
bend
a
little
more
forward
he
said
to
the
victim
and
much
tighter
don
t
trouble
to
look
pleasant
because
i
can
t
see
your
face
anyway
it
may
sound
unorthodox
to
say
so
but
this
is
going
to
hurt
you
much
more
than
it
will
hurt
there
was
a
carefully
measured
pause
and
then
lancelot
was
made
vividly
aware
of
what
a
good
cane
can
be
made
to
do
in
really
efficient
hands
at
the
second
cut
he
projected
himself
hurriedly
off
the
chair
now
i
ve
lost
count
said
comus
we
shall
have
to
begin
all
over
again
kindly
get
back
into
the
same
position
if
you
get
down
again
before
i
ve
finished
rutley
will
hold
you
over
and
you
ll
get
a
lancelot
got
back
on
to
the
chair
and
was
to
the
taste
of
his
executioner
he
stayed
there
somehow
or
other
while
comus
made
eight
accurate
and
agonisingly
effective
shots
at
the
chalk
line
by
the
way
he
said
to
his
gasping
and
gulping
victim
when
the
infliction
was
over
you
said
chetrof
didn
t
you
i
believe
i
ve
been
asked
to
be
kind
to
you
as
a
beginning
you
can
clean
out
my
study
this
afternoon
be
awfully
careful
how
you
dust
the
old
china
if
you
break
any
don
t
come
and
tell
me
but
just
go
and
drown
yourself
somewhere
it
will
save
you
from
a
worse
i
don
t
know
where
your
study
is
said
lancelot
between
his
chokes
you
d
better
find
it
or
i
shall
have
to
beat
you
really
hard
this
time
here
you
d
better
keep
this
chalk
in
your
pocket
it
s
sure
to
come
in
handy
later
on
don
t
stop
to
thank
me
for
all
i
ve
done
it
only
embarrasses
as
comus
hadn
t
got
a
study
lancelot
spent
a
feverish
in
looking
for
it
incidentally
missing
another

practice
everything
is
very
jolly
here
wrote
lancelot
to
his
sister
emmeline
the
prefects
can
give
you
an
awful
hot
time
if
they
like
but
most
of
them
are
rather
decent
some
are
beasts
bassington
is
a
prefect
though
only
a
junior
one
he
is
the
limit
as
beasts
go
at
least
i
think

chapter
iii
on
the
evening
of
a
certain
november
day
two
years
after
the
events
heretofore
chronicled
francesca
bassington
steered
her
way
through
the
crowd
that
filled
the
rooms
of
her
friend
serena
golackly
bestowing
nods
of
vague
recognition
as
she
went
but
with
eyes
that
were
obviously
intent
on
focussing
one
particular
figure
parliament
had
pulled
its
energies
together
for
an
autumn
session
and
both
political
parties
were
fairly
well
represented
in
the
throng
serena
had
a
harmless
way
of
inviting
a
number
of
more
or
less
public
men
and
women
to
her
house
and
hoping
that
if
you
left
them
together
long
enough
they
would
constitute
a
in
pursuance
of
the
same
instinct
she
planted
the
flower
borders
at
her
cottage
retreat
in
surrey
with
a
large
mixture
of
bulbs
and
called
the
result
a
dutch
garden
unfortunately
though
you
may
bring
brilliant
talkers
into
your
home
you
can
not
always
make
them
talk
brilliantly
or
even
talk
at
all
what
is
worse
you
can
not
restrict
the
output
of
those
dullards
who
seem
to
have
on
all
subjects
so
much
to
say
that
was
well
worth
leaving
unsaid
one
group
that
francesca
passed
was
discussing
a
spanish
painter
who
was
and
had
painted
thousands
of
square
yards
of
canvas
in
his
time
but
of
whom
no
one
in
london
had
heard
till
a
few
months
ago
now
the
seemed
determined
that
one
should
hear
of
very
little
else
three
women
knew
how
his
name
was
pronounced
another
always
felt
that
she
must
go
into
a
forest
and
pray
whenever
she
saw
his
pictures
another
had
noticed
that
there
were
always
pomegranates
in
his
later
compositions
and
a
man
with
an
indefensible
collar
knew
what
the
pomegranates
what
i
think
so
splendid
about
him
said
a
stout
lady
in
a
loud
challenging
voice
is
the
way
he
defies
all
the
conventions
of
art
while
retaining
all
that
the
conventions
stand
ah
but
have
you
put
in
the
man
with
the
atrocious
collar
and
francesca
pushed
desperately
on
wondering
dimly
as
she
went
what
people
found
so
unsupportable
in
the
affliction
of
deafness
her
progress
was
impeded
for
a
moment
by
a
couple
engaged
in
earnest
and
voluble
discussion
of
some
smouldering
question
of
the
day
a
thin
spectacled
young
man
with
the
receding
forehead
that
so
often
denotes
advanced
opinions
was
talking
to
a
spectacled
young
woman
with
a
similar
type
of
forehead
and
exceedingly
untidy
hair
it
was
her
ambition
in
life
to
be
taken
for
a
russian
and
she
had
spent
weeks
of
patient
research
in
trying
to
find
out
exactly
where
you
put
the
in
a
samovar
she
had
once
been
introduced
to
a
young
jewess
from
odessa
who
had
died
of
pneumonia
the
following
week
the
experience
slight
as
it
was
constituted
the
spectacled
young
lady
an
authority
on
all
things
russian
in
the
eyes
of
her
immediate
set
talk
is
helpful
talk
is
needful
the
young
man
was
saying
but
what
we
have
got
to
do
is
to
lift
the
subject
out
of
the
furrow
of
indisciplined
talk
and
place
it
on
the
of
practical
the
young
woman
took
advantage
of
the
rhetorical
to
dash
in
with
the
remark
which
was
already
marshalled
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
in
emancipating
the
serfs
of
poverty
we
must
be
careful
to
avoid
the
mistakes
which
russian
bureaucracy
stumbled
into
when
liberating
the
serfs
of
the
she
paused
in
her
turn
for
the
sake
of
declamatory
effect
but
recovered
her
breath
quickly
enough
to
start
afresh
on
level
terms
with
the
young
man
who
had
jumped
into
the
stride
of
his
next
sentence
they
got
off
to
a
good
start
that
time
said
francesca
to
herself
i
suppose
it
s
the
prevention
of
destitution
they
re
hammering
at
what
on
earth
would
become
of
these
dear
good
people
if
anyone
started
a
crusade
for
the
prevention
of
mediocrity
midway
through
one
of
the
smaller
rooms
still
questing
for
an
elusive
presence
she
caught
sight
of
someone
that
she
knew
and
the
shadow
of
a
frown
passed
across
her
face
the
object
of
her
faintly
signalled
displeasure
was
courtenay
youghal
a
political
who
seemed
absurdly
youthful
to
a
generation
that
had
never
heard
of
pitt
it
was
youghal
s
perhaps
his
infuse
into
the
greyness
of
modern
political
life
some
of
the
colour
of
disraelian
dandyism
tempered
with
the
correctness
of
taste
and
supplemented
by
the
flashes
of
wit
that
were
inherent
from
the
celtic
strain
in
him
his
success
was
only
a
the
public
missed
in
him
that
touch
of
blatancy
which
it
looks
for
in
its
rising
public
men
the
decorative
smoothness
of
his
hair
and
the
lively
sparkle
of
his
epigrams
were
counted
to
him
for
good
but
the
restrained
sumptuousness
of
his
waistcoats
and
cravats
were
as
wasted
efforts
if
he
had
habitually
smoked
cigarettes
in
a
pink
coral
mouthpiece
or
worn
spats
of
mackenzie
tartan
the
great
heart
of
the
and
the
gush
of
the
might
have
been
unreservedly
his
the
art
of
public
life
consists
to
a
great
extent
of
knowing
exactly
where
to
stop
and
going
a
bit
further
it
was
not
youghal
s
lack
of
political
sagacity
that
had
brought
the
momentary
look
of
disapproval
into
francesca
s
face
the
fact
was
that
comus
who
had
left
off
being
a
schoolboy
and
was
now
a
social
problem
had
lately
enrolled
himself
among
the
young
politician
s
associates
and
admirers
and
as
the
boy
knew
and
cared
nothing
about
politics
and
merely
copied
youghal
s
waistcoats
and
less
successfully
his
conversation
francesca
felt
herself
justified
in
deploring
the
intimacy
to
a
woman
who
dressed
well
on
comparatively
nothing
a
year
it
was
an
anxious
experience
to
have
a
son
who
dressed
sumptuously
on
absolutely
nothing
the
cloud
that
had
passed
over
her
face
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
offending
youghal
was
presently
succeeded
by
a
smile
of
gratified
achievement
as
she
encountered
a
bow
of
recognition
and
welcome
from
a
portly
gentleman
who
seemed
genuinely
anxious
to
include
her
in
the
rather
meagre
group
that
he
had
gathered
about
him
we
were
just
talking
about
my
new
charge
he
observed
genially
including
in
the
we
his
somewhat
listeners
who
in
all
human
probability
had
done
none
of
the
talking
i
was
just
telling
them
and
you
may
be
interested
to
hear
francesca
with
spartan
stoicism
continued
to
wear
an
ingratiating
smile
though
the
character
of
the
deaf
adder
that
stoppeth
her
ear
and
will
not
hearken
seemed
to
her
at
that
moment
a
beautiful
one
sir
julian
jull
had
been
a
member
of
a
house
of
commons
distinguished
for
its
high
standard
of
mediocrity
and
had
harmonised
so
thoroughly
with
his
surroundings
that
the
most
attentive
observer
of
parliamentary
proceedings
could
scarcely
have
told
even
on
which
side
of
the
house
he
sat
a
baronetcy
bestowed
on
him
by
the
party
in
power
had
at
least
removed
that
doubt
some
weeks
later
he
had
been
made
governor
of
some
west
indian
dependency
whether
as
a
reward
for
having
accepted
the
baronetcy
or
as
an
application
of
a
theory
that
west
indian
islands
get
the
governors
they
deserve
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
to
sir
julian
the
appointment
was
doubtless
one
of
some
importance
during
the
span
of
his
governorship
the
island
might
possibly
be
visited
by
a
member
of
the
royal
family
or
at
the
least
by
an
earthquake
and
in
either
case
his
name
would
get
into
the
papers
to
the
public
the
matter
was
one
of
absolute
indifference
who
is
he
and
where
is
it
would
have
correctly
epitomised
the
sum
total
of
general
information
on
the
personal
and
geographical
aspects
of
the
case
francesca
however
from
the
moment
she
had
heard
of
the
likelihood
of
the
appointment
had
taken
a
deep
and
lively
interest
in
sir
julian
as
a
member
of
parliament
he
had
not
filled
any
very
pressing
social
want
in
her
life
and
on
the
rare
occasions
when
she
took
tea
on
the
terrace
of
the
house
she
was
wont
to
lapse
into
rapt
contemplation
of
thomas
s
hospital
whenever
she
saw
him
within
bowing
distance
but
as
governor
of
an
island
he
would
of
course
want
a
private
secretary
and
as
a
friend
and
colleague
of
henry
greech
to
whom
he
was
indebted
for
many
little
acts
of
political
support
they
had
once
jointly
drafted
an
amendment
which
had
been
ruled
out
of
order
what
was
more
natural
and
proper
than
that
he
should
let
his
choice
fall
on
henry
s
nephew
comus
while
privately
doubting
whether
the
boy
would
make
the
sort
of
secretary
that
any
public
man
would
esteem
as
a
treasure
henry
was
thoroughly
in
agreement
with
francesca
as
to
the
excellence
and
desirability
of
an
arrangement
which
would
transplant
that
troublesome
young
animal
from
the
too
restricted
and
conspicuous
area
that
centres
in
the
parish
of
james
s
to
some
misty
corner
of
the
british
dominion
overseas
brother
and
sister
had
conspired
to
give
an
elaborate
and
at
the
same
time
cosy
little
luncheon
to
sir
julian
on
the
very
day
that
his
appointment
was
officially
announced
and
the
question
of
the
secretaryship
had
been
mooted
and
sedulously
fostered
as
occasion
permitted
until
all
that
was
now
needed
to
clinch
the
matter
was
a
formal
interview
between
his
excellency
and
comus
the
boy
had
from
the
first
shewn
very
little
gratification
at
the
prospect
of
his
deportation
to
live
on
a
remote
island
as
he
expressed
it
with
the
jull
family
as
his
chief
social
mainstay
and
sir
julian
s
conversation
as
a
daily
item
of
his
existence
did
not
inspire
him
with
the
same
degree
of
enthusiasm
as
was
displayed
by
his
mother
and
uncle
who
after
all
were
not
making
the
experiment
even
the
necessity
for
an
entirely
new
outfit
did
not
appeal
to
his
imagination
with
the
force
that
might
have
been
expected
but
however
lukewarm
his
adhesion
to
the
project
might
be
francesca
and
her
brother
were
clearly
determined
that
no
lack
of
deft
persistence
on
their
part
should
endanger
its
success
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
reminding
sir
julian
of
his
promise
to
meet
comus
at
lunch
on
the
following
day
and
definitely
settle
the
matter
of
the
secretaryship
that
francesca
was
now
enduring
the
ordeal
of
a
long
harangue
on
the
value
of
the
west
indian
group
as
an
imperial
asset
other
listeners
dexterously
detached
themselves
one
by
one
but
francesca
s
patience
outlasted
even
sir
julian
s
flow
of
commonplaces
and
her
devotion
was
duly
rewarded
by
a
renewed
acknowledgment
of
the
lunch
engagement
and
its
purpose
she
pushed
her
way
back
through
the
throng
of
chatterers
fortified
by
a
sense
of
victory
dear
serena
s
absurd
served
some
good
purpose
after
all
francesca
was
not
an
early
riser
and
her
breakfast
was
only
just
beginning
to
mobilise
on
the
next
morning
when
a
copy
of
sent
by
special
messenger
from
her
brother
s
house
was
brought
up
to
her
room
a
heavy
margin
of
blue
pencilling
drew
her
attention
to
a
letter
which
bore
the
ironical
heading
julian
jull
the
matter
of
the
letter
was
a
cruel
of
some
fatuous
and
forgotten
speeches
made
by
sir
julian
to
his
constituents
not
many
years
ago
in
which
the
value
of
some
of
our
colonial
possessions
particularly
certain
west
indian
islands
was
decried
in
a
medley
of
pomposity
ignorance
and
amazingly
cheap
humour
the
extracts
given
sounded
weak
and
foolish
enough
taken
by
themselves
but
the
writer
of
the
letter
had
interlarded
them
with
comments
of
his
own
which
sparkled
with
an
ironical
brilliance
that
was
in
its
polished
cruelty
remembering
her
ordeal
of
the
previous
evening
francesca
permitted
herself
a
certain
feeling
of
amusement
as
she
read
the
merciless
stabs
inflicted
on
the
governor
then
she
came
to
the
signature
at
the
foot
of
the
letter
and
the
laughter
died
out
of
her
eyes
comus
bassington
stared
at
her
from
above
a
thick
layer
of
blue
pencil
lines
marked
by
henry
greech
s
shaking
hand
comus
could
no
more
have
devised
such
a
letter
than
he
could
have
written
an
episcopal
charge
to
the
clergy
of
any
given
diocese
it
was
obviously
the
work
of
courtenay
youghal
and
comus
for
a
palpable
purpose
of
his
own
had
wheedled
him
into
foregoing
for
once
the
pride
of
authorship
in
a
clever
piece
of
political
raillery
and
letting
his
young
friend
stand
sponsor
instead
it
was
a
daring
stroke
and
there
could
be
no
question
as
to
its
success
the
secretaryship
and
the
distant
island
faded
away
into
the
horizon
of
impossible
things
francesca
forgetting
the
golden
rule
of
strategy
which
enjoins
a
careful
choosing
of
ground
and
opportunity
before
entering
on
hostilities
made
straight
for
the
bathroom
door
behind
which
a
lively
din
of
splashing
betokened
that
comus
had
at
least
begun
his
toilet
you
wicked
boy
what
have
you
done
she
cried
reproachfully
me
washee
came
a
cheerful
shout
me
washee
from
the
neck
all
the
way
down
to
the
merrythought
and
now
washee
down
from
the
merrythought
you
have
ruined
your
future
has
printed
that
miserable
letter
with
your
a
loud
squeal
of
joy
came
from
the
bath
oh
mummy
let
me
see
there
were
sounds
as
of
a
sprawling
dripping
body
clambering
hastily
out
of
the
bath
francesca
fled
one
can
not
effectively
scold
a
moist
old
boy
clad
only
in
a
and
a
cloud
of
steam
another
messenger
arrived
before
francesca
s
breakfast
was
over
this
one
brought
a
letter
from
sir
julian
jull
excusing
himself
from
fulfilment
of
the
luncheon
engagement
chapter
iv
francesca
prided
herself
on
being
able
to
see
things
from
other
people
s
points
of
view
which
meant
as
it
usually
does
that
she
could
see
her
own
point
of
view
from
various
aspects
as
regards
comus
whose
doings
and
bulked
largely
in
her
thoughts
at
the
present
moment
she
had
mapped
out
in
her
mind
so
clearly
what
his
outlook
in
life
ought
to
be
that
she
was
peculiarly
unfitted
to
understand
the
drift
of
his
feelings
or
the
impulses
that
governed
them
fate
had
endowed
her
with
a
son
in
limiting
the
endowment
to
a
solitary
offspring
fate
had
certainly
shown
a
moderation
which
francesca
was
perfectly
willing
to
acknowledge
and
be
thankful
for
but
then
as
she
pointed
out
to
a
certain
complacent
friend
of
hers
who
cheerfully
sustained
an
endowment
of
male
offsprings
and
a
girl
or
two
her
one
child
was
comus
moderation
in
numbers
was
more
than
counterbalanced
in
his
case
by
extravagance
in
characteristics
francesca
mentally
compared
her
son
with
hundreds
of
other
young
men
whom
she
saw
around
her
steadily
and
no
doubt
happily
engaged
in
the
process
of
transforming
themselves
from
nice
boys
into
useful
citizens
most
of
them
had
occupations
or
were
industriously
engaged
in
qualifying
for
such
in
their
leisure
moments
they
smoked
cigarettes
went
to
the
cheaper
seats
at
watched
an
occasional
cricket
match
at
lord
s
with
apparent
interest
saw
most
of
the
world
s
spectacular
events
through
the
medium
of
the
cinematograph
and
were
wont
to
exchange
at
parting
seemingly
superfluous
injunctions
to
be
the
whole
of
bond
street
and
many
of
the
tributary
thoroughfares
of
piccadilly
might
have
been
swept
off
the
face
of
modern
london
without
in
any
way
interfering
with
the
supply
of
their
daily
wants
they
were
doubtless
dull
as
acquaintances
but
as
sons
they
would
have
been
eminently
restful
with
a
growing
sense
of
irritation
francesca
compared
these
deserving
young
men
with
her
own
intractable
offspring
and
wondered
why
fate
should
have
singled
her
out
to
be
the
parent
of
such
a
vexatious
variant
from
a
comfortable
and
desirable
type
as
far
as
remunerative
achievement
was
concerned
comus
copied
the
insouciance
of
the
field
lily
with
a
dangerous
fidelity
like
his
mother
he
looked
round
with
wistful
irritation
at
the
example
afforded
by
contemporary
youth
but
he
concentrated
his
attention
exclusively
on
the
richer
circles
of
his
acquaintance
young
men
who
bought
cars
and
polo
ponies
as
unconcernedly
as
he
might
purchase
a
carnation
for
his
buttonhole
and
went
for
trips
to
cairo
or
the
tigris
valley
with
less
difficulty
and
than
he
encountered
in
contriving
a
at
brighton
gaiety
and
had
carried
comus
successfully
and
on
the
whole
pleasantly
through
schooldays
and
a
recurring
succession
of
holidays
the
same
desirable
assets
were
still
at
his
service
to
advance
him
along
his
road
but
it
was
a
disconcerting
experience
to
find
that
they
could
not
be
relied
on
to
go
all
distances
at
all
times
in
an
animal
world
and
a
fiercely
competitive
animal
world
at
that
something
more
was
needed
than
the
decorative
of
the
field
lily
and
it
was
just
that
something
more
which
comus
seemed
unable
or
unwilling
to
provide
on
his
own
account
it
was
just
the
lack
of
that
something
more
which
left
him
sulking
with
fate
over
the
numerous
breakdowns
and
that
held
him
up
on
what
he
expected
to
be
a
triumphal
or
at
any
rate
unimpeded
progress
francesca
was
in
her
own
way
fonder
of
comus
than
of
anyone
else
in
the
world
and
if
he
had
been
browning
his
skin
somewhere
east
of
suez
she
would
probably
have
kissed
his
photograph
with
genuine
fervour
every
night
before
going
to
bed
the
appearance
of
a
cholera
scare
or
rumour
of
native
rising
in
the
columns
of
her
daily
would
have
caused
her
a
flutter
of
anxiety
and
she
would
have
mentally
likened
herself
to
a
spartan
mother
sacrificing
her
on
the
altar
of
state
necessities
but
with
the
installed
under
her
roof
occupying
an
unreasonable
amount
of
cubic
space
and
demanding
daily
sacrifices
instead
of
providing
the
raw
material
for
one
her
feelings
were
tinged
with
irritation
rather
than
affection
she
might
have
forgiven
comus
generously
for
misdeeds
of
some
gravity
committed
in
another
continent
but
she
could
never
overlook
the
fact
that
out
of
a
dish
of
five
plovers
eggs
he
was
certain
to
take
three
the
absent
may
be
always
wrong
but
they
are
seldom
in
a
position
to
be
inconsiderate
thus
a
wall
of
ice
had
grown
up
gradually
between
mother
and
son
a
barrier
across
which
they
could
hold
converse
but
which
gave
a
wintry
chill
even
to
the
sparkle
of
their
lightest
words
the
boy
had
the
gift
of
being
irresistibly
amusing
when
he
chose
to
exert
himself
in
that
direction
and
after
a
long
series
of
moody
or
jangling
he
would
break
forth
into
a
torrential
flow
of
small
talk
scandal
and
malicious
anecdote
true
or
more
generally
invented
to
which
francesca
listened
with
a
relish
and
appreciation
that
was
all
the
more
flattering
from
being
so
unwillingly
bestowed
if
you
chose
your
friends
from
a
rather
more
reputable
set
you
would
be
doubtless
less
amusing
but
there
would
be
compensating
francesca
snapped
the
remark
out
at
lunch
one
day
when
she
had
been
betrayed
into
a
broader
smile
than
she
considered
the
circumstances
of
her
attitude
towards
comus
warranted
i
m
going
to
move
in
quite
decent
society
replied
comus
with
a
pleased
chuckle
i
m
going
to
meet
you
and
uncle
henry
and
heaps
of
nice
dull
people
at
francesca
gave
a
little
gasp
of
surprise
and
annoyance
you
don
t
mean
to
say
caroline
has
asked
you
to
dinner
she
said
and
of
course
without
telling
me
how
exceedingly
like
her
lady
caroline
benaresq
had
reached
that
age
when
you
can
say
and
do
what
you
like
in
defiance
of
people
s
most
sensitive
feelings
and
most
cherished
antipathies
not
that
she
had
waited
to
attain
her
present
age
before
pursuing
that
line
of
conduct
she
came
of
a
family
whose
individual
members
went
through
life
from
the
nursery
to
the
grave
with
as
much
tact
and
consideration
as
a
might
show
in
going
through
a
crowded
bathing
tent
it
was
a
compensating
mercy
that
they
disagreed
rather
more
among
themselves
than
they
did
with
the
outside
world
every
known
variety
and
shade
of
religion
and
politics
had
been
pressed
into
the
family
service
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
any
agreement
on
the
larger
essentials
of
life
and
such
happenings
as
the
home
rule
schism
the
upheaval
and
the
suffragette
crusade
were
thankfully
seized
on
as
furnishing
occasion
for
further
differences
and
lady
caroline
s
favourite
scheme
of
entertaining
was
to
bring
jarring
and
antagonistic
elements
into
close
contact
and
play
them
remorselessly
one
against
the
other
one
gets
much
better
results
under
those
circumstances
she
used
to
observe
than
by
asking
people
who
wish
to
meet
each
other
few
people
talk
as
brilliantly
to
impress
a
friend
as
they
do
to
depress
an
she
admitted
that
her
theory
broke
down
rather
badly
if
you
applied
it
to
parliamentary
debates
at
her
own
dinner
table
its
success
was
usually
triumphantly
vindicated
who
else
is
to
be
there
francesca
asked
with
some
pardonable
misgiving
courtenay
youghal
he
ll
probably
sit
next
to
you
so
you
d
better
think
out
a
lot
of
annihilating
remarks
in
readiness
and
elaine
de
i
don
t
think
i
ve
heard
of
her
who
is
she
nobody
in
particular
but
rather
in
a
solemn
sort
of
way
and
almost
indecently
marry
her
was
the
advice
which
sprang
to
francesca
s
lips
but
she
choked
it
back
with
a
salted
almond
having
a
rare
perception
of
the
fact
that
words
are
sometimes
given
to
us
to
defeat
our
purposes
caroline
has
probably
marked
her
down
for
toby
or
one
of
the
she
said
carelessly
a
little
money
would
be
rather
useful
in
that
quarter
i
comus
tucked
in
his
underlip
with
just
the
shade
of
pugnacity
that
she
wanted
to
see
an
advantageous
marriage
was
so
obviously
the
most
sensible
course
for
him
to
embark
on
that
she
scarcely
dared
to
hope
that
he
would
seriously
entertain
it
yet
there
was
just
a
chance
that
if
he
got
as
far
as
the
flirtation
stage
with
an
attractive
and
attracted
girl
who
was
also
an
heiress
the
sheer
perversity
of
his
nature
might
carry
him
on
to
more
definite
courtship
if
only
from
the
desire
to
thrust
other
more
genuinely
enamoured
suitors
into
the
background
it
was
a
forlorn
hope
so
forlorn
that
the
idea
even
crossed
her
mind
of
throwing
herself
on
the
mercy
of
her
courtenay
youghal
and
trying
to
enlist
the
influence
which
he
seemed
to
possess
over
comus
for
the
purpose
of
furthering
her
hurriedly
conceived
project
anyhow
the
dinner
promised
to
be
more
interesting
than
she
had
originally
anticipated
lady
caroline
was
a
professed
socialist
in
politics
chiefly
it
was
believed
because
she
was
thus
enabled
to
disagree
with
most
of
the
liberals
and
conservatives
and
all
the
socialists
of
the
day
she
did
not
permit
her
socialism
however
to
penetrate
below
stairs
her
cook
and
butler
had
every
encouragement
to
be
individualists
francesca
who
was
a
keen
and
intelligent
food
critic
harboured
no
misgivings
as
to
her
hostess
s
kitchen
and
cellar
departments
some
of
the
human
at
the
feast
gave
her
more
ground
for
uneasiness
courtenay
youghal
for
instance
would
probably
be
brilliantly
silent
her
brother
henry
would
almost
certainly
be
the
reverse
the
dinner
party
was
a
large
one
and
francesca
arrived
late
with
little
time
to
take
preliminary
stock
of
the
guests
a
card
with
the
name
miss
de
frey
immediately
opposite
her
own
place
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
indicated
however
the
whereabouts
of
the
heiress
it
was
characteristic
of
francesca
that
she
first
carefully
read
the
menu
from
end
to
end
and
then
indulged
in
an
equally
careful
though
less
open
scrutiny
of
the
girl
who
sat
opposite
her
the
girl
who
was
nobody
in
particular
but
whose
income
was
everything
that
could
be
desired
she
was
pretty
in
a
restrained
fashion
and
had
a
look
of
grave
reflective
calm
that
probably
masked
a
speculative
unsettled
temperament
her
pose
if
one
wished
to
be
critical
was
just
a
little
too
elaborately
careless
she
wore
some
excellently
set
rubies
with
that
indefinable
air
of
having
more
at
home
that
is
so
difficult
to
improvise
francesca
was
distinctly
pleased
with
her
survey
you
seem
interested
in
your
said
courtenay
youghal
i
almost
think
i
ve
seen
her
before
said
francesca
her
face
seems
familiar
to
the
narrow
gallery
at
the
louvre
attributed
to
leonardo
da
vinci
said
youghal
of
course
said
francesca
her
feelings
divided
between
satisfaction
at
capturing
an
elusive
impression
and
annoyance
that
youghal
should
have
been
her
helper
a
stronger
tinge
of
annoyance
possessed
her
when
she
heard
the
voice
of
henry
greech
raised
in
painful
prominence
at
lady
caroline
s
end
of
the
table
i
called
on
the
trudhams
yesterday
he
announced
it
was
their
silver
wedding
you
know
at
least
the
day
before
was
such
lots
of
silver
presents
quite
a
show
of
course
there
were
a
great
many
duplicates
but
still
very
nice
to
have
i
think
they
were
very
pleased
to
get
so
we
must
not
grudge
them
their
show
of
presents
after
their
years
of
married
life
said
lady
caroline
gently
it
is
the
silver
lining
to
their
a
third
of
the
guests
present
were
related
to
the
trudhams
lady
caroline
is
beginning
well
murmured
courtenay
youghal
i
should
hardly
call
years
of
married
life
a
cloud
said
henry
greech
lamely
don
t
let
s
talk
about
married
life
said
a
tall
handsome
woman
who
looked
like
some
modern
painter
s
conception
of
the
goddess
bellona
it
s
my
misfortune
to
write
eternally
about
husbands
and
wives
and
their
variants
my
public
expects
it
of
me
i
do
so
envy
journalists
who
can
write
about
plagues
and
strikes
and
anarchist
plots
and
other
pleasing
things
instead
of
being
tied
down
to
one
stale
old
who
is
that
woman
and
what
has
she
written
francesca
asked
youghal
she
dimly
remembered
having
seen
her
at
one
of
serena
golackly
s
gatherings
surrounded
by
a
little
court
of
admirers
i
forget
her
name
she
has
a
villa
at
san
remo
or
mentone
or
somewhere
where
one
does
have
villas
and
plays
an
extraordinary
good
game
of
bridge
also
she
has
the
reputation
rather
rare
in
your
sex
of
being
a
wonderfully
sound
judge
of
but
what
has
she
written
oh
several
novels
of
the
thinnish
ice
order
her
last
one
the
woman
who
wished
it
was
wednesday
has
been
banned
at
all
the
libraries
i
expect
you
ve
read
i
don
t
see
why
you
should
think
so
said
francesca
coldly
only
because
comus
lent
me
your
copy
yesterday
said
youghal
he
threw
back
his
handsome
head
and
gave
her
a
sidelong
glance
of
quizzical
amusement
he
knew
that
she
hated
his
intimacy
with
comus
and
he
was
secretly
rather
proud
of
his
influence
over
the
boy
shallow
and
negative
though
he
knew
it
to
be
it
had
been
on
his
part
an
unsought
intimacy
and
it
would
probably
fall
to
pieces
the
moment
he
tried
seriously
to
take
up
the
of
mentor
the
fact
that
comus
s
mother
openly
disapproved
of
the
friendship
gave
it
perhaps
its
chief
interest
in
the
young
politician
s
eyes
francesca
turned
her
attention
to
her
brother
s
end
of
the
table
henry
greech
had
willingly
availed
himself
of
the
invitation
to
leave
the
subject
of
married
life
and
had
launched
forthwith
into
the
equally
theme
of
current
politics
he
was
not
a
person
who
was
in
much
demand
for
public
meetings
and
the
house
showed
no
great
impatience
to
hear
his
views
on
the
topics
of
the
moment
its
impatience
indeed
was
manifested
rather
in
the
opposite
direction
hence
he
was
prone
to
unburden
himself
of
accumulated
political
wisdom
as
occasion
presented
indeed
to
assume
an
occasion
that
was
hardly
visible
to
the
naked
intelligence
our
opponents
are
engaged
in
a
hopelessly
uphill
struggle
and
they
know
it
he
chirruped
defiantly
they
ve
become
possessed
like
the
gadarene
swine
with
a
whole
legion
surely
the
gadarene
swine
went
downhill
put
in
lady
caroline
in
a
gently
enquiring
voice
henry
greech
hastily
abandoned
simile
and
fell
back
on
platitude
and
the
safer
kinds
of
fact
francesca
did
not
regard
her
brother
s
views
on
statecraft
either
in
the
light
of
gospel
or
revelation
as
comus
once
remarked
they
more
usually
suggested
exodus
in
the
present
instance
she
found
distraction
in
a
renewed
scrutiny
of
the
girl
opposite
her
who
seemed
to
be
only
moderately
interested
in
the
conversational
efforts
of
the
diners
on
either
side
of
her
comus
who
was
looking
and
talking
his
best
was
sitting
at
the
further
end
of
the
table
and
francesca
was
quick
to
notice
in
which
direction
the
girl
s
glances
were
continually
straying
once
or
twice
the
eyes
of
the
young
people
met
and
a
swift
flush
of
pleasure
and
a
that
spoke
of
good
understanding
came
to
the
heiress
s
face
it
did
not
need
the
gift
of
the
traditional
intuition
of
her
sex
to
enable
francesca
to
guess
that
the
girl
with
the
desirable
banking
account
was
already
considerably
attracted
by
the
lively
young
pagan
who
had
when
he
cared
to
practise
it
such
an
art
of
winning
admiration
for
the
first
time
for
many
many
months
francesca
saw
her
son
s
prospects
in
a
setting
and
she
began
unconsciously
to
wonder
exactly
how
much
wealth
was
summed
up
in
the
expressive
label
almost
indecently
a
wife
with
a
really
large
fortune
and
a
correspondingly
big
dower
of
character
and
ambition
might
perhaps
succeed
in
turning
comus
s
latent
energies
into
a
groove
which
would
provide
him
if
not
with
a
career
at
least
with
an
occupation
and
the
young
serious
face
opposite
looked
as
if
its
owner
lacked
neither
character
or
ambition
francesca
s
speculations
took
a
more
personal
turn
out
of
the
coffers
with
which
her
imagination
was
toying
an
inconsiderable
sum
might
eventually
be
devoted
to
the
leasing
or
even
perhaps
the
purchase
of
the
house
in
blue
street
when
the
present
convenient
arrangement
should
have
come
to
an
end
and
francesca
and
the
van
der
meulen
would
not
be
obliged
to
seek
fresh
quarters
a
woman
s
voice
talking
in
a
discreet
undertone
on
the
other
side
of
courtenay
youghal
broke
in
on
her
tons
of
money
and
really
very
presentable
just
the
wife
for
a
rising
young
politician
go
in
and
win
her
before
she
s
snapped
up
by
some
fortune
youghal
and
his
instructress
in
worldly
wisdom
were
looking
straight
across
the
table
at
the
leonardo
da
vinci
girl
with
the
grave
reflective
eyes
and
the
air
of
repose
francesca
felt
a
quick
throb
of
anger
against
her
neighbour
why
she
asked
herself
must
some
women
with
no
end
or
purpose
of
their
own
to
serve
except
the
sheer
love
of
meddling
in
the
affairs
of
others
plunge
their
hands
into
plots
and
schemings
of
this
sort
in
which
the
happiness
of
more
than
one
person
was
concerned
and
more
clearly
than
ever
she
realised
how
thoroughly
she
detested
courtenay
youghal
she
had
disliked
him
as
an
evil
influence
setting
before
her
son
an
example
of
showy
ambition
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
likely
to
follow
and
providing
him
with
a
model
of
extravagant
dandyism
that
he
was
only
too
certain
to
copy
in
her
heart
she
knew
that
comus
would
have
embarked
just
as
surely
on
his
present
course
of
idle
if
he
had
never
known
of
the
existence
of
youghal
but
she
chose
to
regard
that
young
man
as
her
son
s
evil
genius
and
now
he
seemed
likely
to
justify
more
than
ever
the
character
she
had
fastened
on
to
him
for
once
in
his
life
comus
appeared
to
have
an
idea
of
behaving
sensibly
and
making
some
use
of
his
opportunities
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
courtenay
youghal
arrived
on
the
scene
as
a
possible
and
very
dangerous
rival
against
the
good
looks
and
fitful
powers
of
fascination
that
comus
could
bring
into
the
field
the
young
politician
could
match
dazzling
qualities
which
would
go
far
to
recommend
him
in
the
eyes
of
a
woman
of
the
world
still
more
in
those
of
a
young
girl
in
search
of
an
ideal
in
his
own
way
if
not
on
such
showy
lines
as
comus
always
well
witty
without
being
bumptious
with
a
conspicuous
parliamentary
career
alongside
him
and
heaven
knew
what
else
in
front
of
him
courtenay
youghal
certainly
was
not
a
rival
whose
chances
could
be
held
very
lightly
francesca
laughed
bitterly
to
herself
as
she
remembered
that
a
few
hours
ago
she
had
entertained
the
idea
of
begging
for
his
good
offices
in
helping
on
comus
s
wooing
one
consolation
at
least
she
found
for
herself
if
youghal
really
meant
to
step
in
and
try
and
cut
out
his
young
friend
the
latter
at
any
rate
had
snatched
a
useful
start
comus
had
mentioned
miss
de
frey
at
luncheon
that
day
casually
and
dispassionately
if
the
subject
of
the
dinner
guests
had
not
come
up
he
would
probably
not
have
mentioned
her
at
all
but
they
were
obviously
already
very
good
friends
it
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
state
of
domestic
tension
at
blue
street
that
francesca
should
only
have
come
to
know
of
this
highly
interesting
heiress
by
an
accidental
sorting
of
guests
at
a
dinner
party
lady
caroline
s
voice
broke
in
on
her
reflections
it
was
a
gentle
purring
voice
that
possessed
an
uncanny
quality
of
being
able
to
make
itself
heard
down
the
longest
dinner
table
the
dear
archdeacon
is
getting
so
he
read
a
list
of
for
the
opera
as
the
first
lesson
the
other
sunday
instead
of
the
families
and
lots
of
the
tribes
of
israel
that
entered
canaan
fortunately
no
one
noticed
the
chapter
v
on
a
conveniently
secluded
bench
facing
the
northern
pheasantry
in
the
zoological
society
s
gardens
regent
s
park
courtenay
youghal
sat
immersed
in
mature
flirtation
with
a
lady
who
though
certainly
young
in
fact
and
appearance
was
some
four
or
five
years
his
senior
when
he
was
a
schoolboy
of
sixteen
molly
mcquade
had
personally
conducted
him
to
the
zoo
and
stood
him
dinner
afterwards
at
kettner
s
and
whenever
the
two
of
them
happened
to
be
in
town
on
the
anniversary
of
that
bygone
festivity
they
religiously
repeated
the
programme
in
its
entirety
even
the
menu
of
the
dinner
was
adhered
to
as
nearly
as
possible
the
original
selection
of
food
and
wine
that
schoolboy
exuberance
tempered
by
schoolboy
shyness
had
pitched
on
those
many
years
ago
confronted
youghal
on
those
occasions
as
a
drowning
man
s
past
life
is
said
to
rise
up
and
parade
itself
in
his
last
moments
of
consciousness
the
flirtation
which
was
thus
perennially
restored
to
its
footing
owed
its
longevity
more
to
the
enterprising
solicitude
of
miss
mcquade
than
to
any
conscious
sentimental
effort
on
the
part
of
youghal
himself
molly
mcquade
was
known
to
her
neighbours
in
a
minor
hunting
shire
as
a
conventionally
unconventional
type
of
young
woman
who
came
naturally
into
the
classification
a
good
she
was
just
sufficiently
sufficiently
reticent
about
her
own
illnesses
when
she
had
any
and
sufficiently
appreciative
of
her
neighbours
gardens
children
and
hunters
to
be
generally
popular
most
men
liked
her
and
the
percentage
of
women
who
disliked
her
was
not
inconveniently
high
one
of
these
days
it
was
assumed
she
would
marry
a
brewer
or
a
master
of
otter
hounds
and
after
a
brief
interval
be
known
to
the
world
as
the
mother
of
a
boy
or
two
at
malvern
or
some
similar
seat
of
learning
the
romantic
side
of
her
nature
was
altogether
unguessed
by
the
countryside
her
romances
were
mostly
in
serial
form
and
suffered
perhaps
in
fervour
from
their
disconnected
course
what
they
gained
in
length
of
days
her
affectionate
interest
in
the
several
young
men
who
figured
in
her
affairs
of
the
heart
was
perfectly
honest
and
she
certainly
made
no
attempt
either
to
conceal
their
separate
existences
or
to
play
them
off
one
against
the
other
neither
could
it
be
said
that
she
was
a
husband
hunter
she
had
made
up
her
mind
what
sort
of
man
she
was
likely
to
marry
and
her
forecast
did
not
differ
very
widely
from
that
formed
by
her
local
acquaintances
if
her
married
life
were
eventually
to
turn
out
a
failure
at
least
she
looked
forward
to
it
with
very
moderate
expectations
her
love
affairs
she
put
on
a
very
different
footing
and
apparently
they
were
the
element
in
her
life
she
possessed
the
happily
constituted
temperament
which
enables
a
man
or
woman
to
be
a
pluralist
and
to
observe
the
sage
precaution
of
not
putting
all
one
s
eggs
into
one
basket
her
demands
were
not
exacting
she
required
of
her
affinity
that
he
should
be
young
and
at
least
moderately
amusing
she
would
have
preferred
him
to
be
invariably
faithful
but
with
her
own
example
before
her
she
was
prepared
for
the
probability
bordering
on
certainty
that
he
would
be
nothing
of
the
sort
the
philosophy
of
the
garden
of
kama
was
the
compass
by
which
she
steered
her
barque
and
thus
far
if
she
had
encountered
some
storms
and
buffeting
she
had
at
least
escaped
being
either
shipwrecked
or
becalmed
courtenay
youghal
had
not
been
designed
by
nature
to
fulfil
the
of
an
ardent
or
devoted
lover
and
he
scrupulously
respected
the
limits
which
nature
had
laid
down
for
molly
however
he
had
a
certain
responsive
affection
she
had
always
obviously
admired
him
and
at
the
same
time
she
never
beset
him
with
crude
flattery
the
principal
reason
why
the
flirtation
had
stood
the
test
of
so
many
years
was
the
fact
that
it
only
flared
into
active
existence
at
convenient
intervals
in
an
age
when
the
telephone
has
undermined
almost
every
fastness
of
human
privacy
and
the
sanctity
of
one
s
seclusion
depends
often
on
the
ability
for
tactful
falsehood
shown
by
a
club
pageboy
youghal
was
duly
appreciative
of
the
circumstance
that
his
lady
fair
spent
a
large
part
of
the
year
pursuing
foxes
in
lieu
of
pursuing
him
also
the
honestly
admitted
fact
that
in
her
human
hunting
she
rode
after
more
than
one
quarry
made
the
inevitable
of
the
affair
a
matter
to
which
both
could
look
forward
without
a
sense
of
coming
embarrassment
and
recrimination
when
the
time
for
gathering
ye
rosebuds
should
be
over
neither
of
them
could
accuse
the
other
of
having
wrecked
his
or
her
entire
life
at
the
most
they
would
only
have
disorganised
a
on
this
particular
afternoon
when
old
reminiscences
had
been
gone
through
and
the
intervening
gossip
of
past
months
duly
recounted
a
lull
in
the
conversation
made
itself
rather
obstinately
felt
molly
had
already
guessed
that
matters
were
about
to
slip
into
a
new
phase
the
affair
had
reached
maturity
long
ago
and
a
new
phase
must
be
in
the
nature
of
a
wane
you
re
a
clever
brute
she
said
suddenly
with
an
air
of
affectionate
regret
i
always
knew
you
d
get
on
in
the
house
but
i
hardly
expected
you
to
come
to
the
front
so
i
m
coming
to
the
front
admitted
youghal
judicially
the
problem
is
shall
i
be
able
to
stay
there
unless
something
happens
in
the
financial
line
before
long
i
don
t
see
how
i
m
to
stay
in
parliament
at
all
economy
is
out
of
the
question
it
would
open
people
s
eyes
i
fancy
if
they
knew
how
little
i
exist
on
as
it
is
and
i
m
living
so
far
beyond
my
income
that
we
may
almost
be
said
to
be
living
it
will
have
to
be
a
rich
wife
i
suppose
said
molly
slowly
that
s
the
worst
of
success
it
imposes
so
many
conditions
i
rather
knew
from
something
in
your
manner
that
you
were
drifting
that
youghal
said
nothing
in
the
way
of
contradiction
he
gazed
steadfastly
at
the
aviary
in
front
of
him
as
though
exotic
pheasants
were
for
the
moment
the
most
absorbing
study
in
the
world
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
mind
was
centred
on
the
image
of
elaine
de
frey
with
her
clear
untroubled
eyes
and
her
leonardo
da
vinci
air
he
was
wondering
whether
he
was
likely
to
fall
into
a
frame
of
mind
concerning
her
which
would
be
in
the
least
like
falling
in
love
i
shall
mind
horribly
continued
molly
after
a
pause
but
of
course
i
have
always
known
that
something
of
the
sort
would
have
to
happen
one
of
these
days
when
a
man
goes
into
politics
he
can
t
call
his
soul
his
own
and
i
suppose
his
heart
becomes
an
impersonal
possession
in
the
same
most
people
who
know
me
would
tell
you
that
i
haven
t
got
a
heart
said
youghal
i
ve
often
felt
inclined
to
agree
with
them
said
molly
and
then
now
and
again
i
think
you
have
a
heart
tucked
away
i
hope
i
have
said
youghal
because
i
m
trying
to
break
to
you
the
fact
that
i
think
i
m
falling
in
love
with
molly
mcquade
turned
sharply
to
look
at
her
companion
who
still
fixed
his
gaze
on
the
pheasant
run
in
front
of
him
don
t
tell
me
you
re
losing
your
head
over
somebody
useless
someone
without
money
she
said
i
don
t
think
i
could
stand
for
the
moment
she
feared
that
courtenay
s
selfishness
might
have
taken
an
unexpected
turn
in
which
ambition
had
given
way
to
the
fancy
of
the
hour
he
might
be
going
to
sacrifice
his
parliamentary
career
for
a
life
of
stupid
lounging
in
momentarily
attractive
company
he
quickly
undeceived
her
she
s
got
heaps
of
molly
gave
a
grunt
of
relief
her
affection
for
courtenay
had
produced
the
anxiety
which
underlay
her
first
question
a
natural
jealousy
prompted
the
next
one
is
she
young
and
pretty
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
or
is
she
just
a
good
sort
with
a
sympathetic
manner
and
nice
eyes
as
a
rule
that
s
the
kind
that
goes
with
a
lot
of
young
and
quite
in
her
way
and
a
distinct
style
of
her
own
some
people
would
call
her
beautiful
as
a
political
hostess
i
should
think
she
d
be
splendid
i
imagine
i
m
rather
in
love
with
and
is
she
in
love
with
you
youghal
threw
back
his
head
with
the
slight
assertive
movement
that
molly
knew
and
liked
she
s
a
girl
who
i
fancy
would
let
judgment
influence
her
a
lot
and
without
being
stupidly
conceited
i
think
i
may
say
she
might
do
worse
than
throw
herself
away
on
me
i
m
young
and
quite
and
i
m
making
a
name
for
myself
in
the
house
she
ll
be
able
to
read
all
sorts
of
nice
and
horrid
things
about
me
in
the
papers
at
i
can
be
brilliantly
amusing
at
times
and
i
understand
the
value
of
silence
there
is
no
fear
that
i
shall
ever
degenerate
into
that
fearsome
cheerful
talkative
husband
for
a
girl
with
money
and
social
ambitions
i
should
think
i
was
rather
a
good
you
are
certainly
in
love
courtenay
said
molly
but
it
s
the
old
love
and
not
a
new
one
i
m
rather
glad
i
should
have
hated
to
have
you
in
love
with
a
pretty
woman
even
for
a
short
time
you
ll
be
much
happier
as
it
is
and
i
m
going
to
put
all
my
feelings
in
the
background
and
tell
you
to
go
in
and
win
you
ve
got
to
marry
a
rich
woman
and
if
she
s
nice
and
will
make
a
good
hostess
so
much
the
better
for
everybody
you
ll
be
happier
in
your
married
life
than
i
shall
be
in
mine
when
it
comes
you
ll
have
other
interests
to
absorb
you
i
shall
just
have
the
garden
and
dairy
and
nursery
and
lending
library
as
like
as
two
peas
to
all
the
gardens
and
dairies
and
nurseries
for
hundreds
of
miles
round
you
won
t
care
for
your
wife
enough
to
be
worried
every
time
she
has
a
and
you
ll
like
her
well
enough
to
be
pleased
to
meet
her
sometimes
at
your
own
house
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
you
were
quite
happy
she
will
probably
be
miserable
but
any
woman
who
married
you
would
there
was
a
short
pause
they
were
both
staring
at
the
pheasant
cages
then
molly
spoke
again
with
the
swift
nervous
tone
of
a
general
who
is
hurriedly
altering
the
disposition
of
his
forces
for
a
strategic
retreat
when
you
are
safely
married

and

that

of

put
your

through
her
paces

she
disapproved
it
is
true
of
a
great
many
of
her
son
s
friends
and
associates
but
this
particular
one
was
a
special
and
persistent
source
of
irritation
to
her
from
the
fact
that
he
figured
prominently
and
more
or
less
successfully
in
the
public
life
of
the
day
there
was
something
peculiarly
exasperating
in
reading
a
brilliant
and
incisive
attack
on
the
government
s
rash
handling
of
public
expenditure
delivered
by
a
young
man
who
encouraged
her
son
in
every
imaginable
extravagance
the
actual
extent
of
youghal
s
influence
over
the
boy
was
of
the
slightest
comus
was
quite
capable
of
deriving
encouragement
to
rash
outlay
and
frivolous
conversation
from
an
anchorite
or
an
parson
if
he
had
been
thrown
into
close
companionship
with
such
an
individual
francesca
however
exercised
a
mother
s
privilege
in
assuming
her
son
s
bachelor
associates
to
be
industrious
in
labouring
to
achieve
his
undoing
therefore
the
young
politician
was
a
source
of
unconcealed
annoyance
to
her
and
in
the
same
degree
as
she
expressed
her
disapproval
of
him
comus
was
careful
to
maintain
and
parade
the
intimacy
its
existence
or
rather
its
continued
existence
was
one
of
the
things
that
faintly
puzzled
the
young
lady
whose
favour
might
have
been
expected
to
furnish
an
occasion
for
its
rapid
dissolution
with
two
suitors
one
of
whom
at
least
she
found
markedly
attractive
courting
her
at
the
same
moment
elaine
should
have
had
reasonable
cause
for
being
on
good
terms
with
the
world
and
with
herself
in
particular
happiness
was
not
however
at
this
auspicious
moment
her
dominant
mood
the
grave
calm
of
her
face
masked
as
usual
a
certain
degree
of
grave
perturbation
a
succession
of
governesses
and
a
plentiful
supply
of
moralising
aunts
on
both
sides
of
her
family
had
impressed
on
her
young
mind
the
theoretical
fact
that
wealth
is
a
great
responsibility
the
consciousness
of
her
responsibility
set
her
continually
wondering
not
as
to
her
own
fitness
to
discharge
her
stewardship
but
as
to
the
motives
and
merits
of
people
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
the
knowledge
that
there
was
so
much
in
the
world
that
she
could
buy
invited
speculation
as
to
how
much
there
was
that
was
worth
buying
gradually
she
had
come
to
regard
her
mind
as
a
sort
of
appeal
court
before
whose
secret
sittings
were
examined
and
judged
the
motives
and
actions
the
motives
especially
of
the
world
in
general
in
her
schoolroom
days
she
had
sat
in
conscientious
judgment
on
the
motives
that
guided
or
misguided
charles
and
cromwell
and
monck
wallenstein
and
savonarola
in
her
present
stage
she
was
equally
occupied
in
examining
the
political
sincerity
of
the
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
the
of
a
but
possibly
and
the
disinterestedness
of
a
whole
circle
of
indulgent
and
flattering
acquaintances
even
more
absorbing
and
in
her
eyes
more
urgently
necessary
was
the
task
of
dissecting
and
appraising
the
characters
of
the
two
young
men
who
were
favouring
her
with
their
attentions
and
herein
lay
cause
for
much
thinking
and
some
perturbation
youghal
for
example
might
have
baffled
a
more
experienced
observer
of
human
nature
elaine
was
too
clever
to
confound
his
dandyism
with
foppishness
or
he
admired
his
own
toilet
effect
in
a
mirror
from
a
genuine
sense
of
pleasure
in
a
thing
good
to
look
upon
just
as
he
would
feel
a
sensuous
appreciation
of
the
sight
of
a
pair
of
horses
behind
his
careful
political
flippancy
and
cynicism
one
might
also
detect
a
certain
careless
sincerity
which
would
probably
in
the
long
run
save
him
from
moderate
success
and
turn
him
into
one
of
the
brilliant
failures
of
his
day
beyond
this
it
was
difficult
to
form
an
exact
appreciation
of
courtenay
youghal
and
elaine
who
liked
to
have
her
impressions
distinctly
labelled
and
was
perpetually
scrutinising
the
outer
surface
of
his
characteristics
and
utterances
like
a
baffled
art
critic
vainly
searching
beneath
the
varnish
and
scratches
of
a
doubtfully
assigned
picture
for
an
enlightening
signature
the
young
man
added
to
her
perplexities
by
his
deliberate
policy
of
never
trying
to
show
himself
in
a
favourable
light
even
when
most
anxious
to
impart
a
favourable
impression
he
preferred
that
people
should
hunt
for
his
good
qualities
and
merely
took
very
good
care
that
as
far
as
possible
they
should
never
draw
blank
even
in
the
matter
of
selfishness
which
was
the
of
his
existence
he
contrived
to
be
noted
and
justly
noted
for
doing
remarkably
unselfish
things
as
a
ruler
he
would
have
been
reasonably
popular
as
a
husband
he
would
probably
be
unendurable
comus
was
to
a
certain
extent
as
great
a
mystification
as
youghal
but
here
elaine
was
herself
responsible
for
some
of
the
perplexity
which
enshrouded
his
character
in
her
eyes
she
had
taken
more
than
a
passing
fancy
for
the
the
boy
as
he
might
be
that
was
to
she
was
desperately
unwilling
to
see
him
and
appraise
him
as
he
really
was
thus
the
mental
court
of
appeal
was
constantly
engaged
in
examining
witnesses
as
to
character
most
of
whom
signally
failed
to
give
any
testimony
which
would
support
the
favourable
judgment
which
the
tribunal
was
so
anxious
to
arrive
at
a
woman
with
wider
experience
of
the
world
s
ways
and
shortcomings
would
probably
have
contented
herself
with
an
endeavour
to
find
out
whether
her
liking
for
the
boy
outweighed
her
dislike
of
his
characteristics
elaine
took
her
judgments
too
seriously
to
approach
the
matter
from
such
a
simple
and
convenient
standpoint
the
fact
that
she
was
much
more
than
half
in
love
with
comus
made
it
dreadfully
important
that
she
should
discover
him
to
have
a
lovable
soul
and
comus
it
must
be
confessed
did
little
to
help
forward
the
discovery
at
any
rate
he
is
honest
she
would
observe
to
herself
after
some
outspoken
admission
of
unprincipled
conduct
on
his
part
and
then
she
would
ruefully
recall
certain
episodes
in
which
he
had
figured
from
which
honesty
had
been
conspicuously
absent
what
she
tried
to
label
honesty
in
his
candour
was
probably
only
a
cynical
defiance
of
the
laws
of
right
and
wrong
you
look
more
than
usually
thoughtful
this
afternoon
said
comus
to
her
as
if
you
had
invented
this
summer
day
and
were
trying
to
think
out
if
i
had
the
power
to
create
improvements
anywhere
i
think
i
should
begin
with
you
retorted
elaine
i
m
sure
it
s
much
better
to
leave
me
as
i
am
protested
comus
you
re
like
a
relative
of
mine
up
in
argyllshire
who
spends
his
time
producing
improved
breeds
of
sheep
and
pigs
and
chickens
so
patronising
and
irritating
to
the
almighty
i
should
think
to
go
about
putting
superior
finishing
touches
to
elaine
frowned
and
then
laughed
and
finally
gave
a
little
sigh
it
s
not
easy
to
talk
sense
to
you
she
said
whatever
else
you
take
in
hand
said
youghal
you
must
never
improve
this
garden
it
s
what
our
idea
of
heaven
might
be
like
if
the
jews
hadn
t
invented
one
for
us
on
totally
different
lines
it
s
dreadful
that
we
should
accept
them
as
the
impresarios
of
our
religious
dreamland
instead
of
the
you
are
not
very
fond
of
the
jews
said
elaine
i
ve
travelled
and
lived
a
good
deal
in
eastern
europe
said
youghal
it
seems
largely
a
question
of
geography
said
elaine
in
england
no
one
really
is
youghal
shook
his
head
i
know
a
great
many
jews
who
servants
had
quietly
almost
reverently
placed
tea
and
its
accessories
on
the
wicker
table
and
quietly
receded
from
the
landscape
elaine
sat
like
a
grave
young
goddess
about
to
dispense
some
mysterious
potion
to
her
devotees
her
mind
was
still
sitting
in
judgment
on
the
jewish
question
comus
scrambled
to
his
feet
it
s
too
hot
for
tea
he
said
i
shall
go
and
feed
the
and
he
walked
off
with
a
little
silver
containing
brown
elaine
laughed
quietly
it
s
so
like
comus
she
said
to
go
off
with
our
one
dish
of
youghal
chuckled
responsively
it
was
an
undoubted
opportunity
for
him
to
put
in
some
disparaging
criticism
of
comus
and
elaine
sat
alert
in
readiness
to
judge
the
critic
and
reserve
judgment
on
the
criticised
his
selfishness
is
splendid
but
absolutely
futile
said
youghal
now
my
selfishness
is
commonplace
but
always
thoroughly
practical
and
calculated
he
will
have
great
difficulty
in
getting
the
swans
to
accept
his
offering
and
he
incurs
the
odium
of
reducing
us
to
a
condition
incidentally
he
will
get
very
elaine
again
had
the
sense
of
being
thoroughly
baffled
if
youghal
had
said
anything
unkind
it
was
about
himself
if
my
cousin
suzette
had
been
here
she
observed
with
the
shadow
of
a
malicious
smile
on
her
lips
i
believe
she
would
have
gone
into
a
flood
of
tears
at
the
loss
of
her
and
comus
would
have
figured
ever
after
in
her
mind
as
something
black
and
destroying
and
hateful
in
fact
i
don
t
really
know
why
we
took
our
loss
so
for
two
reasons
said
youghal
you
are
rather
fond
of
comus
and
not
very
fond
of
the
jesting
remark
brought
a
throb
of
pleasure
to
elaine
s
heart
she
had
known
full
well
that
she
cared
for
comus
but
now
that
courtenay
youghal
had
openly
proclaimed
the
fact
as
something
unchallenged
and
understood
matters
seemed
placed
at
once
on
a
more
advanced
footing
the
warm
sunlit
garden
grew
suddenly
into
a
heaven
that
held
the
secret
of
eternal
happiness
youth
and
comeliness
would
always
walk
here
under
the
mulberry
trees
as
unchanging
as
the
leaden
otter
that
for
ever
preyed
on
the
leaden
salmon
on
the
edge
of
the
old
fountain
and
somehow
the
lovers
would
always
wear
the
aspect
of
herself
and
the
boy
who
was
talking
to
the
four
white
swans
by

he
was
possessed
by
an
overmastering
desire
to
keep

at
all
costs
a
look
of
greedy
determination
dominated
his
face
and
he
had
not
for
an
instant
relaxed
his
grip
of
the
coveted
object
elaine
was
genuinely
angry
by
this
time
and
was
busily
telling
herself
that
it
was
absurd
to
be
put
out
over
such
a
trifle
at
the
same
moment
a
sense
of
justice
was
telling
her
that
comus
was
displaying
a
good
deal
of
rather
shabby
selfishness
and
somehow
her
chief
anxiety
at
the
moment
was
to
keep
courtenay

seeing
that

was

i

an
industrious
worker
on

blathlington
the
afternoon
seemed
to
get
instantly
hotter
merla
was
one
of
those
human
flies
that
buzz
in
crowded
streets
at
bazaars
and
in
warm
weather
she
attained
to
the
proportions
of
a
human
bluebottle
lady
caroline
benaresq
had
openly
predicted
that
a
special
was
being
reserved
for
her
accommodation
in
another
world
others
however
held
the
opinion
that
she
would
be
miraculously
multiplied
in
a
future
state
and
that
four
or
more
merla
blathlingtons
according
to
deserts
would
be
in
perpetual
and
unremitting
attendance
on
each
lost
soul
here
we
are
she
cried
with
a
glad
eager
buzz
popping
in
and
out
of
shops
like
rabbits
not
that
rabbits
do
pop
in
and
out
of
shops
very
it
was
evidently
one
of
her
bluebottle
days
don
t
you
love
bond
street
she
gabbled
on
there
s
something
so
unusual
and
distinctive
about
it
no
other
street
anywhere
else
is
quite
like
it
don
t
you
know
those
ikons
and
images
and
things
scattered
up
and
down
europe
that
are
supposed
to
have
been
painted
or
carved
as
the
case
may
be
by
luke
or
zaccheus
or
somebody
of
that
sort
i
always
like
to
think
that
some
notable
person
of
those
times
designed
bond
street
paul
perhaps
he
travelled
about
a
not
in
middlesex
though
said
francesca
one
can
t
be
sure
persisted
merla
when
one
wanders
about
as
much
as
he
did
one
gets
mixed
up
and
forgets
where
one
been
i
can
never
remember
whether
i
ve
been
to
the
tyrol
twice
and
moritz
once
or
the
other
way
about
i
always
have
to
ask
my
maid
and
there
s
something
about
the
name
bond
that
suggests
paul
didn
t
he
write
a
lot
about
the
bond
and
the
free
i
fancy
he
wrote
in
hebrew
or
greek
objected
francesca
the
word
wouldn
t
have
the
least
so
dreadfully
to
go
about
pamphleteering
in
those
bizarre
languages
complained
merla
that
s
what
makes
all
those
people
so
elusive
as
soon
as
you
try
to
pin
them
down
to
a
definite
statement
about
anything
you
re
told
that
some
vitally
important
word
has
fifteen
other
meanings
in
the
original
i
wonder
our
cabinet
ministers
and
politicians
don
t
adopt
a
sort
of
or
esperanto
jargon
to
deliver
their
speeches
in
what
a
lot
of
subsequent
explaining
away
would
be
saved
but
to
go
back
to
bond
that
we
ve
left
i
m
afraid
i
must
leave
it
now
said
francesca
preparing
to
turn
up
grafton
street
must
you
be
going
come
and
have
tea
somewhere
i
know
of
a
cosy
little
place
where
one
can
talk
francesca
repressed
a
shudder
and
pleaded
an
urgent
engagement
i
know
where
you
re
going
said
merla
with
the
resentful
buzz
of
a
bluebottle
that
finds
itself
thwarted
by
the
cold
unreasoning
resistance
of
a
windowpane
you
re
going
to
play
bridge
at
serena
golackly
s
she
never
asks
me
to
her
bridge
francesca
shuddered
openly
this
time
the
prospect
of
having
to
play
bridge
anywhere
in
the
near
neighbourhood
of
merla
s
voice
was
not
one
that
could
be
contemplated
with
ordinary
calmness
she
said
again
firmly
and
passed
out
of
earshot
it
was
rather
like
leaving
the
machinery
section
of
an
exhibition
merla
s
diagnosis
of
her
destination
had
been
a
correct
one
francesca
made
her
way
slowly
through
the
hot
streets
in
the
direction
of
serena
golackly
s
house
on
the
far
side
of
berkeley
square
to
the
blessed
certainty
of
finding
a
game
of
bridge
she
hopefully
added
the
possibility
of
hearing
some
fragments
of
news
which
might
prove
interesting
and
enlightening
and
of
enlightenment
on
a
particular
subject
in
which
she
was
acutely
and
personally
interested
she
stood
in
some
need
comus
of
late
had
been
provokingly
reticent
as
to
his
movements
and
doings
partly
perhaps
because
it
was
his
nature
to
be
provoking
partly
because
the
daily
bickerings
over
money
matters
were
gradually
choking
other
forms
of
conversation
francesca
had
seen
him
once
or
twice
in
the
park
in
the
desirable
company
of
elaine
de
frey
and
from
time
to
time
she
heard
of
the
young
people
as
having
danced
together
at
various
houses
on
the
other
hand
she
had
seen
and
heard
quite
as
much
evidence
to
connect
the
heiress
s
name
with
that
of
courtenay
youghal
beyond
this
meagre
and
conflicting
and
altogether
tantalising
information
her
knowledge
of
the
present
position
of
affairs
did
not
go
if
either
of
the
young
men
was
seriously
making
the
running
it
was
probable
that
she
would
hear
some
sly
hint
or
open
comment
about
it
from
one
of
serena
s
friends
without
having
to
go
out
of
her
way
to
introduce
the
subject
and
unduly
disclose
her
own
state
of
ignorance
and
a
game
of
bridge
played
for
moderately
high
points
gave
ample
excuse
for
convenient
lapses
into
reticence
if
questions
took
an
embarrassingly
inquisitive
turn
one
could
always
find
refuge
in
a
defensive
spade
the
afternoon
was
too
warm
to
make
bridge
a
generally
popular
diversion
and
serena
s
party
was
a
comparatively
small
one
only
one
table
was
incomplete
when
francesca
made
her
appearance
on
the
scene
at
it
was
seated
serena
herself
confronted
by
ada
spelvexit
whom
everyone
was
wont
to
explain
as
one
of
the
cheshire
spelvexits
as
though
any
other
variety
would
have
been
intolerable
ada
spelvexit
was
one
of
those
naturally
stagnant
souls
who
take
infinite
pleasure
in
what
are
called
most
of
the
really
great
lessons
i
have
learned
have
been
taught
me
by
the
poor
was
one
of
her
favourite
statements
the
one
great
lesson
that
the
poor
in
general
would
have
liked
to
have
taught
her
that
their
kitchens
and
sickrooms
were
not
unreservedly
at
her
disposal
as
private
lecture
halls
she
had
never
been
able
to
assimilate
she
was
ready
to
give
them
unlimited
advice
as
to
how
they
should
keep
the
wolf
from
their
doors
but
in
return
she
claimed
and
enforced
for
herself
the
penetrating
powers
of
an
east
wind
or
a
dust
storm
her
visits
among
her
wealthier
acquaintances
were
equally
extensive
and
enterprising
and
hardly
more
welcome
in
parties
while
partaking
to
the
fullest
extent
of
the
hospitality
offered
her
she
made
a
practice
of
unburdening
herself
of
homilies
on
the
evils
of
leisure
and
luxury
which
did
not
particularly
endear
her
to
her
fellow
guests
hostesses
regarded
her
philosophically
as
a
form
of
social
measles
which
everyone
had
to
have
once
the
third
prospective
player
francesca
noted
without
any
special
enthusiasm
was
lady
caroline
benaresq
lady
caroline
was
far
from
being
a
remarkably
good
bridge
player
but
she
always
managed
to
domineer
mercilessly
over
any
table
that
was
favoured
with
her
presence
and
generally
managed
to
win
a
domineering
player
usually
inflicts
the
chief
damage
and
demoralisation
on
his
partner
lady
caroline
s
special
achievement
was
to
harass
and
demoralise
partner
and
opponents
alike
weak
and
weak
she
announced
in
her
gentle
voice
as
she
cut
her
hostess
for
a
partner
i
suppose
we
had
better
play
only
five
shillings
a
francesca
wondered
at
the
old
woman
s
moderate
assessment
of
the
stake
knowing
her
fondness
for
highish
play
and
her
usual
good
luck
in
card
holding
i
don
t
mind
what
we
play
said
ada
spelvexit
with
an
incautious
parade
of
elegant
indifference
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
inwardly
relieved
and
rejoicing
at
the
reasonable
figure
proposed
by
lady
caroline
and
she
would
certainly
have
demurred
if
a
higher
stake
had
been
suggested
she
was
not
as
a
rule
a
successful
player
and
money
lost
at
cards
was
always
a
poignant
bereavement
to
her
then
as
you
don
t
mind
we
ll
make
it
ten
shillings
a
hundred
said
lady
caroline
with
the
pleased
chuckle
of
one
who
has
spread
a
net
in
the
sight
of
a
bird
and
disproved
the
vanity
of
the
proceeding
it
proved
a
tiresome
rubber
with
the
strength
of
the
cards
slightly
on
francesca
s
side
and
the
luck
of
the
table
going
mostly
the
other
way
she
was
too
keen
a
player
not
to
feel
a
certain
absorption
in
the
game
once
it
had
started
but
she
was
conscious
of
a
distracting
interest
that
competed
with
the
momentary
importance
of
leads
and
discards
and
declarations
the
little
accumulations
of
talk
that
were
unpent
during
the
dealing
of
the
hands
became
as
noteworthy
to
her
alert
attention
as
the
play
of
the
hands
themselves
yes
quite
a
small
party
this
afternoon
said
serena
in
reply
to
a
seemingly
casual
remark
on
francesca
s
part
and
two
or
three
which
is
unusual
on
a
wednesday
canon
besomley
was
here
just
before
you
came
you
know
the
big
preaching
i
ve
been
to
hear
him
scold
the
human
race
once
or
twice
said
francesca
a
strong
man
with
a
wonderfully
strong
message
said
ada
spelvexit
in
an
impressive
and
assertive
tone
the
sort
of
popular
pulpiteer
who
spanks
the
vices
of
his
age
and
lunches
with
them
afterwards
said
lady
caroline
hardly
a
fair
summary
of
the
man
and
his
work
protested
ada
i
ve
been
to
hear
him
many
times
when
i
ve
been
depressed
or
discouraged
and
i
simply
can
t
tell
you
the
impression
his
words
at
least
you
can
tell
us
what
you
intend
to
make
trumps
broke
in
lady
caroline
gently
diamonds
pronounced
ada
after
a
rather
flurried
survey
of
her
hand
doubled
said
lady
caroline
with
increased
gentleness
and
a
few
minutes
later
she
was
pencilling
an
addition
of
to
her
score
i
stayed
with
his
people
down
in
herefordshire
last
may
said
ada
returning
to
the
unfinished
theme
of
the
canon
such
an
exquisite
rural
retreat
and
so
restful
and
healing
to
the
nerves
real
country
scenery
apple
blossom
surely
only
on
the
apple
trees
said
lady
caroline
ada
spelvexit
gave
up
the
attempt
to
reproduce
the
decorative
setting
of
the
canon
s
homelife
and
fell
back
on
the
small
but
practical
consolation
of
scoring
the
odd
trick
in
her
opponent
s
declaration
of
hearts
if
you
had
led
your
highest
club
to
start
with
instead
of
the
nine
we
should
have
saved
the
trick
remarked
lady
caroline
to
her
partner
in
a
tone
of
coldly
gentle
reproof
it
s
no
use
my
dear
she
continued
as
serena
flustered
out
a
halting
apology
no
earthly
use
to
attempt
to
play
bridge
at
one
table
and
try
to
see
and
hear
what
s
going
on
at
two
or
three
other
i
can
generally
manage
to
attend
to
more
than
one
thing
at
a
time
said
serena
rashly
i
think
i
must
have
a
sort
of
double
much
better
to
economise
and
have
one
really
good
one
observed
lady
caroline
belle
dame
sans
scoring
a
verbal
trick
or
two
as
usual
said
a
player
at
another
table
in
a
discreet
undertone
did
i
tell
you
sir
edward
roan
is
coming
to
my
next
big
evening
said
serena
hurriedly
by
way
perhaps
of
restoring
herself
a
little
in
her
own
esteem
poor
dear
good
sir
edward
what
have
you
made
trumps
asked
lady
caroline
in
one
breath
clubs
said
francesca
and
pray
why
these
adjectives
of
commiseration
francesca
was
a
ministerialist
by
family
interest
and
allegiance
and
was
inclined
to
take
up
the
cudgels
at
the
suggested
disparagement
aimed
at
the
foreign
secretary
he
amuses
me
so
much
purred
lady
caroline
her
amusement
was
usually
of
the
sort
that
a
sporting
cat
derives
from
watching
the
swedish
exercises
of
a
and
carefully
mouse
really
he
has
been
rather
a
brilliant
success
at
the
foreign
office
you
know
said
francesca
he
reminds
one
so
of
a
circus
more
intelligent
than
the
people
who
direct
him
but
quite
content
to
go
on
putting
his
foot
down
or
taking
it
up
as
may
be
required
quite
unconcerned
whether
he
steps
on
a
meringue
or
a
hornet
s
nest
in
the
process
of
going
where
he
s
expected
to
how
can
you
say
such
things
protested
francesca
i
can
t
said
lady
caroline
courtenay
youghal
said
it
in
the
house
last
night
didn
t
you
read
the
debate
he
was
really
rather
in
form
i
disagree
entirely
with
his
point
of
view
of
course
but
some
of
the
things
he
says
have
just
enough
truth
behind
them
to
redeem
them
from
being
merely
smart
for
instance
his
summing
up
of
the
government
s
attitude
towards
our
embarrassing
colonial
empire
in
the
wistful
phrase
happy
is
the
country
that
has
no
what
an
absurdly
unjust
thing
to
say
put
in
francesca
i
daresay
some
of
our
party
at
some
time
have
taken
up
that
attitude
but
every
one
knows
that
sir
edward
is
a
sound
imperialist
at
most
politicians
are
something
or
other
at
heart
but
no
one
would
be
rash
enough
to
insure
a
politician
against
heart
failure
particularly
when
he
happens
to
be
in
anyhow
i
don
t
see
that
the
opposition
leaders
would
have
acted
any
differently
in
the
present
case
said
francesca
one
should
always
speak
guardedly
of
the
opposition
leaders
said
lady
caroline
in
her
gentlest
voice
one
never
knows
what
a
turn
in
the
situation
may
do
for
you
mean
they
may
one
day
be
at
the
head
of
affairs
asked
serena
briskly
i
mean
they
may
one
day
lead
the
opposition
one
never
lady
caroline
had
just
remembered
that
her
hostess
was
on
the
opposition
side
in
politics
francesca
and
her
partner
scored
four
tricks
in
clubs
the
game
stood
irresolutely
at
all
if
you
had
followed
the
excellent
lyrical
advice
given
to
the
maid
of
athens
and
returned
my
heart
we
should
have
made
two
more
tricks
and
gone
game
said
lady
caroline
to
her
partner
mr
youghal
seems
pushing
himself
to
the
fore
of
late
remarked
francesca
as
serena
took
up
the
cards
to
deal
since
the
young
politician
s
name
had
been
introduced
into
their
conversation
the
opportunity
for
turning
the
talk
more
directly
on
him
and
his
affairs
was
too
good
to
be
missed
i
think
he
s
got
a
career
before
him
said
serena
the
house
always
fills
when
he
s
speaking
and
that
s
a
good
sign
and
then
he
s
young
and
got
rather
an
attractive
personality
which
is
always
something
in
the
political
his
lack
of
money
will
handicap
him
unless
he
can
find
himself
a
rich
wife
or
persuade
someone
to
die
and
leave
him
a
fat
legacy
said
francesca
since
s
have
become
the
recipients
of
a
salary
rather
more
is
expected
and
demanded
of
them
in
the
expenditure
line
than
yes
the
house
of
commons
still
remains
rather
at
the
opposite
pole
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
as
regards
entrance
qualifications
observed
lady
caroline
there
ought
to
be
no
difficulty
about
youghal
picking
up
a
girl
with
money
said
serena
with
his
prospects
he
would
make
an
excellent
husband
for
any
woman
with
social
and
she
half
sighed
as
though
she
almost
regretted
that
a
previous
matrimonial
arrangement
precluded
her
from
entering
into
the
competition
on
her
own
account
francesca
under
an
assumption
of
languid
interest
was
watching
lady
caroline
narrowly
for
some
hint
of
suppressed
knowledge
of
youghal
s
courtship
of
miss
de
frey
whom
are
you
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
the
question
came
from
george
michael
who
had
strayed
over
from
a
neighbouring
table
attracted
by
the
fragments
of
that
had
reached
his
ears
michael
was
one
of
those
dapper
men
who
seem
to
have
been
in
a
certain
stage
of
for
as
long
as
human
memory
can
recall
them
a
peaked
beard
lent
a
certain
dignity
to
his
loan
which
the
rest
of
his
features
and
mannerisms
were
continually
and
successfully
repudiating
his
profession
if
he
had
one
was
submerged
in
his
hobby
which
consisted
of
being
an
for
small
happenings
or
possible
happenings
that
were
or
seemed
imminent
in
the
social
world
around
him
he
found
a
perpetual
and
unflagging
satisfaction
in
acquiring
and
retailing
any
stray
items
of
gossip
or
information
particularly
of
a
matrimonial
nature
that
chanced
to
come
his
way
given
the
bare
outline
of
an
officially
announced
engagement
he
would
immediately
fill
it
in
with
all
manner
of
details
true
or
at
any
rate
probable
drawn
from
his
own
imagination
or
from
some
equally
exclusive
source
the
might
content
itself
with
the
mere
statement
of
the
arrangement
which
would
shortly
take
place
but
it
was
michael
s
breathless
little
voice
that
proclaimed
how
the
contracting
parties
had
originally
met
over
a
incident
why
the
guards
chapel
would
not
be
used
why
her
aunt
mary
had
at
first
opposed
the
match
how
the
question
of
the
children
s
religious
upbringing
had
been
compromised
to
all
whom
it
might
interest
and
to
many
whom
it
might
not
beyond
his
in
this
special
branch
of
intelligence
he
was
chiefly
noteworthy
for
having
a
wife
reputed
to
be
the
tallest
and
thinnest
woman
in
the
home
counties
the
two
were
sometimes
seen
together
in
society
where
they
passed
under
the
collective
name
of
michael
and
all
angles
we
are
trying
to
find
a
rich
wife
for
courtenay
youghal
said
serena
in
answer
to
michael
s
question
ah
there
i
m
afraid
you
re
a
little
late
he
observed
glowing
with
the
importance
of
pending
revelation
i
m
afraid
you
re
a
little
late
he
repeated
watching
the
effect
of
his
words
as
a
gardener
might
watch
the
development
of
a
bed
of
carefully
tended
asparagus
i
think
the
young
gentleman
has
been
before
you
and
already
found
himself
a
rich
mate
in
he
lowered
his
voice
as
he
spoke
not
with
a
view
to
imparting
impressive
mystery
to
his
statement
but
because
there
were
other
table
groups
within
hearing
to
whom
he
hoped
presently
to
have
the
privilege
of
his
revelation
do
you
began
serena
miss
de
frey
broke
in
michael
hurriedly
fearful
lest
his
revelation
should
be
forestalled
even
in
guesswork
quite
an
ideal
choice
the
very
wife
for
a
man
who
means
to
make
his
mark
in
politics
thousand
a
year
with
prospects
of
more
to
come
and
a
charming
place
of
her
own
not
too
far
from
town
quite
the
type
of
girl
too
who
will
make
a
good
political
hostess
brains
without
being
brainy
you
know
just
the
right
thing
of
course
it
would
be
premature
to
make
any
definite
announcement
at
it
would
hardly
be
premature
for
my
partner
to
announce
what
she
means
to
make
trumps
interrupted
lady
caroline
in
a
voice
of
such
sinister
gentleness
that
michael
fled
headlong
back
to
his
own
table
oh
is
it
me
i
beg
your
pardon
i
leave
it
said
serena
thank
you
no
trumps
declared
lady
caroline
the
hand
was
successful
and
the
rubber
ultimately
fell
to
her
with
a
comfortable
margin
of
honours
the
same
partners
cut
together
again
and
this
time
the
cards
went
distinctly
against
francesca
and
ada
spelvexit
and
a
heavily
score
confronted
them
at
the
close
of
the
rubber
francesca
was
conscious
that
a
certain
amount
of
rather
erratic
play
on
her
part
had
at
least
contributed
to
the
result
michael
s
incursion
into
the
conversation
had
proved
rather
a
powerful
distraction
to
her
ordinarily
sound
ada
spelvexit
emptied
her
purse
of
several
gold
pieces
and
infused
a
corresponding
degree
of
superiority
into
her
manner
i
must
be
going
now
she
announced
i
m
dining
early
i
have
to
give
an
address
to
some
charwomen
why
asked
lady
caroline
with
a
disconcerting
directness
that
was
one
of
her
most
formidable
characteristics
oh
well
i
have
some
things
to
say
to
them
that
i
daresay
they
will
like
to
hear
said
ada
with
a
thin
laugh
her
statement
was
received
with
a
silence
that
betokened
profound
unbelief
in
any
such
probability
i
go
about
a
good
deal
among
women
she
added
no
one
has
ever
said
it
observed
lady
caroline
but
how
painfully
true
it
is
that
the
poor
have
us
always
with
ada
spelvexit
hastened
her
departure
the
marred
impressiveness
of
her
retreat
came
as
a
culminating
discomfiture
on
the
top
of
her
at
the
possibly
however
the
multiplication
of
her
own
annoyances
enabled
her
to
survey
charwomen
s
troubles
with
increased
cheerfulness
none
of
them
at
any
rate
had
spent
an
afternoon
with
lady
caroline
francesca
cut
in
at
another
table
and
with
better
fortune
attending
on
her
succeeded
in
winning
back
most
of
her
losses
a
sense
of
satisfaction
was
distinctly
dominant
as
she
took
leave
of
her
hostess
michael
s
gossip
or
rather
the
manner
in
which
it
had
been
received
had
given
her
a
clue
to
the
real
state
of
affairs
which
however
slender
and
conjectural
at
least
pointed
in
the
desired
direction
at
first
she
had
been
horribly
afraid
lest
she
should
be
listening
to
a
definite
announcement
which
would
have
been
the
to
her
hopes
but
as
the
recitation
went
on
without
any
of
those
assured
little
minor
details
which
michael
so
loved
to
supply
she
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
merely
a
piece
of
intelligent
guesswork
and
if
lady
caroline
had
really
believed
in
the
story
of
elaine
de
frey
s
virtual
engagement
to
courtenay
youghal
she
would
have
taken
a
malicious
pleasure
in
encouraging
michael
in
his
confidences
and
in
watching
francesca
s
discomfiture
under
the
recital
the
irritated
manner
in
which
she
had
cut
short
the
discussion
betrayed
the
fact
that
as
far
as
the
old
woman
s
information
went
it
was
comus
and
not
courtenay
youghal
who
held
the
field
and
in
this
particular
case
lady
caroline
s
information
was
likely
to
be
nearer
the
truth
than
michael
s
confident
gossip
francesca
always
gave
a
penny
to
the
first
or
she
chanced
across
after
a
successful
sitting
at
bridge
this
afternoon
she
had
come
out
of
the
fray
some
fifteen
shillings
to
the
bad
but
she
gave
two
pennies
to
a
at
the
corner
of
berkeley
square
as
a
sort
of
to
the
gods
chapter
viii
it
was
a
fresh
afternoon
following
a
morning
that
had
been
sultry
and
torrentially
wet
by
turns
the
sort
of
afternoon
that
impels
people
to
talk
graciously
of
the
rain
as
having
done
a
lot
of
good
its
chief
merit
in
their
eyes
probably
having
been
its
recognition
of
the
art
of
moderation
also
it
was
an
afternoon
that
invited
bodily
activity
after
the
convalescent
languor
of
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
elaine
had
instinctively
found
her
way
into
her
and
sent
an
order
down
to
the
blessed
oasis
that
still
smelt
sweetly
of
horse
and
hay
and
cleanliness
in
a
world
that
reeked
of
petrol
and
now
she
set
her
mare
at
a
smart
pace
through
a
succession
of
country
lanes
she
was
due
some
time
that
afternoon
at
a
but
she
rode
with
determination
in
an
opposite
direction
in
the
first
place
neither
comus
or
courtenay
would
be
at
the
party
which
fact
seemed
to
remove
any
valid
reason
that
could
be
thought
of
for
inviting
her
attendance
thereat
in
the
second
place
about
a
hundred
human
beings
would
be
gathered
there
and
human
gatherings
were
not
her
most
crying
need
at
the
present
moment
since
her
last
encounter
with
her
wooers
under
the
cedars
in
her
own
garden
elaine
realised
that
she
was
either
very
happy
or
cruelly
unhappy
she
could
not
quite
determine
which
she
seemed
to
have
what
she
most
wanted
in
the
world
lying
at
her
feet
and
she
was
dreadfully
uncertain
in
her
more
reflective
moments
whether
she
really
wanted
to
stretch
out
her
hand
and
take
it
it
was
all
very
like
some
situation
in
an
arabian
nights
tale
or
a
story
of
pagan
hellas
and
consequently
the
more
puzzling
and
disconcerting
to
a
girl
brought
up
on
the
methodical
lines
of
victorian
christianity
her
appeal
court
was
in
permanent
session
these
last
few
days
but
it
gave
no
decisions
at
least
none
that
she
would
listen
to
and
the
ride
on
her
fast
little
mare
alone
and
unattended
through
the
leafy
lanes
into
unexplored
country
seemed
just
what
she
wanted
at
the
moment
the
mare
made
some
small
delicate
pretence
of
being
roadshy
not
the
staring
kind
of
nervousness
that
shows
itself
in
an
irritating
as
each
conspicuous
wayside
object
presents
itself
but
the
of
an
imaginative
animal
that
merely
results
in
a
quick
whisk
of
the
head
and
a
swifter
bound
forward
she
might
have
paraphrased
the
mental
attitude
of
the
immortalised
peter
bell
into
a
basket
underneath
a
tree
a
yellow
tiger
is
to
me
if
it
is
nothing
more
the
more
really
alarming
episodes
of
the
road
the
hoot
and
whir
of
a
passing
or
the
loud
vibrating
hum
of
a
wayside
were
treated
with
indifference
on
turning
a
corner
out
of
a
narrow
lane
into
a
wider
road
that
sloped
steadily
upward
in
a
long
stretch
of
hill
elaine
saw
coming
toward
her
at
no
great
distance
a
string
of
vans
drawn
for
the
most
part
by
skewbald
or
speckled
horses
a
certain
rakish
air
about
these
oncoming
proclaimed
them
as
belonging
to
a
travelling
show
decked
out
in
the
rich
primitive
colouring
that
one
s
taste
in
childhood
would
have
insisted
on
before
it
had
been
schooled
in
the
artistic
value
of
dulness
it
was
an
and
distinctly
unwelcome
encounter
the
mare
had
already
commenced
a
sixfold
scrutiny
with
nostrils
eyes
and
ears
one
ear
made
hurried
little
backward
movements
to
hear
what
elaine
was
saying
about
the
eminent
niceness
and
respectability
of
the
approaching
caravan
but
even
elaine
felt
that
she
would
be
unable
satisfactorily
to
explain
the
elephants
and
camels
that
would
certainly
form
part
of
the
procession
to
turn
back
would
seem
rather
craven
and
the
mare
might
take
fright
at
the
manœuvre
and
try
to
bolt
a
gate
standing
ajar
at
the
entrance
to
a
farmyard
lane
provided
a
convenient
way
out
of
the
difficulty
as
elaine
pushed
her
way
through
she
became
aware
of
a
man
standing
just
inside
the
lane
who
made
a
movement
forward
to
open
the
gate
for
her
thank
you
i
m
just
getting
out
of
the
way
of
a
show
she
explained
my
mare
is
tolerant
of
motors
and
but
i
expect
she
broke
off
recognising
the
man
as
an
old
acquaintance
i
heard
you
had
taken
rooms
in
a
farmhouse
somewhere
fancy
meeting
you
in
this
in
the
not
very
distant
days
of
her
tom
keriway
had
been
a
man
to
be
looked
upon
with
a
certain
awe
and
envy
indeed
the
glamour
of
his
roving
career
would
have
fired
the
imagination
and
wistful
desire
to
do
likewise
of
many
young
englishmen
it
seemed
to
be
the
realisation
of
the
games
played
in
dark
rooms
in
winter
evenings
and
the
dreams
dreamed
over
favourite
books
of
adventure
making
vienna
his
headquarters
almost
his
home
he
had
rambled
where
he
listed
through
the
lands
of
the
near
and
middle
east
as
leisurely
and
thoroughly
as
tamer
souls
might
explore
paris
he
had
wandered
through
hungarian
hunted
shy
crafty
beasts
on
lonely
balkan
hillsides
dropped
himself
into
the
stagnant
human
pool
of
some
bulgarian
monastery
threaded
his
way
through
the
strange
racial
mosaic
of
salonika
listened
with
amused
politeness
to
the
shallow
opinions
of
a
voluble
editor
or
lawyer
in
some
wayside
russian
town
or
learned
wisdom
from
a
chance
tavern
companion
one
of
the
atoms
of
the
busy
of
men
and
merchandise
that
moves
untiringly
round
the
shores
of
the
black
sea
and
far
and
wide
as
he
might
roam
he
always
managed
to
turn
up
at
frequent
intervals
at
ball
and
supper
and
theatre
in
the
gay
hauptstadt
of
the
habsburgs
haunting
his
favourite
cafés
and
skimming
through
his
favourite
greeting
old
acquaintances
and
friends
from
ambassadors
down
to
cobblers
in
the
social
scale
he
seldom
talked
of
his
travels
but
it
might
be
said
that
his
travels
talked
of
him
there
was
an
air
about
him
that
a
german
diplomat
once
summed
up
in
a
phrase
a
man
that
wolves
have
sniffed
and
then
two
things
happened
which
he
had
not
mapped
out
in
his
route
a
severe
illness
shook
half
the
life
and
all
the
energy
out
of
him
and
a
heavy
money
loss
brought
him
almost
to
the
door
of
destitution
with
something
perhaps
of
the
impulse
which
drives
a
stricken
animal
away
from
its
kind
tom
keriway
left
the
haunts
where
he
had
known
so
much
happiness
and
withdrew
into
the
shelter
of
a
secluded
farmhouse
lodging
more
than
ever
he
became
to
elaine
a
hearsay
personality
and
now
the
chance
meeting
with
the
caravan
had
flung
her
across
the
threshold
of
his
retreat
what
a
charming
little
nook
you
ve
got
hold
of
she
exclaimed
with
instinctive
politeness
and
then
looked
searchingly
round
and
discovered
that
she
had
spoken
the
truth
it
really
was
charming
the
farmhouse
had
that
intensely
english
look
that
one
seldom
sees
out
of
normandy
over
the
whole
scene
of
rickyard
garden
outbuildings
horsepond
and
orchard
brooded
that
air
which
seems
rightfully
to
belong
to
farmyards
an
air
of
wakeful
dreaminess
which
suggests
that
here
man
and
beast
and
bird
have
got
up
so
early
that
the
rest
of
the
world
has
never
caught
them
up
and
never
will
elaine
dismounted
and
keriway
led
the
mare
round
to
a
little
paddock
by
the
side
of
a
great
grey
barn
at
the
end
of
the
lane
they
could
see
the
show
go
past
a
string
of
lumbering
vans
and
great
striding
beasts
that
seemed
to
link
the
vast
silences
of
the
desert
with
the
noises
and
sights
and
smells
the
and
advertisement
hoardings
and
trampled
of
an
endless
succession
of
towns
you
had
better
let
the
caravan
pass
well
on
its
way
before
you
get
on
the
road
again
said
keriway
the
smell
of
the
beasts
may
make
your
mare
nervous
and
restive
going
then
he
called
to
a
boy
who
was
busy
with
a
hoe
among
some
defiantly
prosperous
weeds
to
fetch
the
lady
a
glass
of
milk
and
a
piece
of
currant
loaf
i
don
t
know
when
i
ve
seen
anything
so
utterly
charming
and
peaceful
said
elaine
propping
herself
on
a
seat
that
a
had
obligingly
designed
in
the
fantastic
curve
of
its
trunk
charming
certainly
said
keriway
but
too
full
of
the
stress
of
its
own
little
life
struggle
to
be
peaceful
since
i
have
lived
here
i
ve
learnt
what
i
ve
always
suspected
that
a
country
farmhouse
set
away
in
a
world
of
its
own
is
one
of
the
most
wonderful
studies
of
interwoven
happenings
and
tragedies
that
can
be
imagined
it
is
like
the
old
chronicles
of
medieval
europe
in
the
days
when
there
was
a
sort
of
ordered
anarchy
between
feudal
lords
and
overlords
and
and
mitred
abbots
and
robber
barons
and
merchant
guilds
and
electors
and
so
forth
all
striving
and
contending
and
and
interfering
with
each
other
under
some
vague
code
of
rules
here
one
sees
it
reproduced
under
one
s
eyes
like
a
musty
page
of
come
to
life
look
at
one
little
section
of
it
the
on
the
farm
villa
poultry
dull
with
records
kept
of
how
many
ounces
of
food
they
eat
and
how
many
pennyworths
of
eggs
they
lay
give
you
no
idea
of
the
of
these
their
feuds
and
jealousies
and
carefully
maintained
prerogatives
their
unsparing
tyrannies
and
persecutions
their
calculated
courage
and
bravado
or
sedulously
hidden
cowardice
it
might
all
be
some
human
chapter
from
the
annals
of
the
old
rhineland
or
medieval
italy
and
then
outside
their
own
bickering
wars
and
hates
the
grim
enemies
that
come
up
against
them
from
the
woodlands
the
hawk
that
dashes
among
the
coops
like
a
raiding
the
border
knowing
well
that
a
charge
of
shot
may
tear
him
to
bits
at
any
moment
and
the
stoat
a
creeping
slip
of
brown
fur
a
few
inches
long
intently
and
unstayably
out
for
blood
and
the
master
of
craft
the
red
fox
who
has
waited
perhaps
half
the
afternoon
for
his
chance
while
the
fowls
were
dusting
themselves
under
the
hedge
and
just
as
they
were
turning
to
the
yard
one
has
stopped
a
moment
to
give
her
feathers
a
final
shake
and
found
death
springing
upon
her
do
you
know
he
continued
as
elaine
fed
herself
and
the
mare
with
morsels
of
i
don
t
think
any
tragedy
in
literature
that
i
have
ever
come
across
impressed
me
so
much
as
the
first
one
that
i
spelled
out
slowly
for
myself
in
words
of
three
letters
the
bad
fox
has
got
the
red
hen
there
was
something
so
dramatically
complete
about
it
the
badness
of
the
fox
added
to
all
the
traditional
guile
of
his
race
seemed
to
heighten
the
horror
of
the
hen
s
fate
and
there
was
such
a
suggestion
of
masterful
malice
about
the
word
one
felt
that
a
countryside
in
arms
would
not
get
that
hen
away
from
the
bad
fox
they
used
to
think
me
a
slow
dull
reader
for
not
getting
on
with
my
lesson
but
i
used
to
sit
and
picture
to
myself
the
red
hen
with
its
wings
beating
helplessly
screeching
in
terrified
protest
or
perhaps
if
he
had
got
it
by
the
neck
with
beak
wide
agape
and
silent
and
eyes
staring
as
it
left
the
farmyard
for
ever
i
have
seen
and
and
abject
defeat
here
and
there
in
my
time
but
the
red
hen
has
remained
in
my
mind
as
the
type
of
helpless
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
again
musing
over
the
drama
that
had
so
dwelt
in
his
childhood
s
imagination
tell
me
some
of
the
things
you
have
seen
in
your
time
was
the
request
that
was
nearly
on
elaine
s
lips
but
she
hastily
checked
herself
and
substituted
another
tell
me
more
about
the
farm
and
he
told
her
of
a
whole
world
or
rather
of
several
intermingled
worlds
set
apart
in
this
sleepy
hollow
in
the
hills
of
beast
lore
and
wood
lore
and
farm
craft
at
times
touching
almost
the
border
of
lightly
here
not
with
the
probing
eagerness
of
those
who
know
nothing
but
with
the
averted
glance
of
those
who
fear
to
see
too
much
he
told
her
of
those
things
that
slept
and
those
that
prowled
when
the
dusk
fell
of
strange
hunting
cats
of
the
yard
swine
and
the
stalled
cattle
of
the
farm
folk
themselves
as
curious
and
remote
in
their
way
in
their
ideas
and
fears
and
wants
and
tragedies
as
the
brutes
and
feathered
stock
that
they
tended
it
seemed
to
elaine
as
if
a
musty
store
of
children
s
books
had
been
fetched
down
from
some
cobwebbed
and
brought
to
life
sitting
there
in
the
little
paddock
grown
thickly
with
tall
weeds
and
rank
grasses
and
shadowed
by
the
old
grey
barn
listening
to
this
chronicle
of
wonderful
things
half
fanciful
half
very
real
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
a
few
miles
away
there
was
a
in
full
swing
with
smart
frocks
and
smart
conversation
fashionable
refreshments
and
fashionable
music
and
a
fevered
undercurrent
of
social
strivings
and
snubbings
did
vienna
and
the
balkan
mountains
and
the
black
sea
seem
as
remote
and
hard
to
believe
in
she
wondered
to
the
man
sitting
by
her
side
who
had
discovered
or
invented
this
wonderful
fairyland
was
it
a
true
and
merciful
arrangement
of
fate
and
life
that
the
things
of
the
moment
thrust
out
the
of
the
things
that
had
been
here
was
one
who
had
held
much
that
was
priceless
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
lost
it
all
and
he
was
happy
and
absorbed
and
with
the
little
wayside
corner
of
the
world
into
which
he
had
crept
and
elaine
who
held
so
many
desirable
things
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
be
even
moderately
happy
she
did
not
even
know
whether
to
take
this
hero
of
her
childhood
down
from
his
pedestal
or
to
place
him
on
a
higher
one
on
the
whole
she
was
inclined
to
resent
rather
than
approve
the
idea
that
and
misfortune
could
so
completely
subdue
and
tame
an
erstwhile
bold
and
roving
spirit
the
mare
was
showing
signs
of
impatience
the
paddock
with
its
teasing
insects
and
very
indifferent
grazing
had
not
thrust
out
the
image
of
her
own
comfortable
elaine
divested
her
habit
of
some
remaining
crumbs
of
and
jumped
lightly
on
to
her
saddle
as
she
rode
slowly
down
the
lane
with
keriway
escorting
her
as
far
as
its
gate
she
looked
round
at
what
had
seemed
to
her
a
short
while
ago
just
a
picturesque
old
farmstead
a
place
of
and
hollyhocks
and
gabled
now
it
was
in
her
eyes
a
magic
city
with
an
undercurrent
of
reality
beneath
its
magic
you
are
a
person
to
be
envied
she
said
to
keriway
you
have
created
a
fairyland
and
you
are
living
in
it
envied
he
shot
the
question
out
with
sudden
bitterness
she
looked
down
and
saw
the
wistful
misery
that
had
come
into
his
face
once
he
said
to
her
in
a
german
paper
i
read
a
short
story
about
a
tame
crippled
crane
that
lived
in
the
park
of
some
small
town
i
forget
what
happened
in
the
story
but
there
was
one
line
that
i
shall
always
remember
it
was
lame
that
is
why
it
was
he
had
created
a
fairyland
but
assuredly
he
was
not
living
in
it
chapter
ix
in
the
warmth
of
a
late
june
morning
the
long
shaded
stretch
of
raked
earth
and
rhododendron
bush
that
is
known
affectionately
as
the
row
was
alive
with
the
monotonous
movement
and
alert
stagnation
appropriate
to
the
time
and
place
the
seekers
after
health
the
seekers
after
notoriety
and
recognition
and
the
lovers
of
good
exercise
were
all
well
represented
on
the
galloping
ground
the
and
chairs
and
long
seats
held
a
population
whose
varied
instincts
and
motives
would
have
baffled
a
social
the
children
handled
or
in
perambulators
might
be
excused
from
instinct
or
motive
they
were
brought
pleasingly
conspicuous
among
a
bunch
of
indifferent
riders
pacing
along
by
the
rails
where
the
onlookers
were
thickest
was
courtenay
youghal
on
his
handsome
gelding
anne
de
joyeuse
that
delicately
stepping
animal
had
taken
a
prize
at
islington
and
nearly
taken
the
life
of
a
of
whom
he
disapproved
but
his
strongest
claims
to
distinction
were
his
good
looks
and
his
high
opinion
of
himself
youghal
evidently
believed
in
thorough
accord
between
horse
and
rider
please
stop
and
talk
to
me
said
a
quiet
beckoning
voice
from
the
other
side
of
the
rails
and
youghal
drew
rein
and
greeted
lady
veula
croot
lady
veula
had
married
into
a
family
of
commercial
solidity
and
enterprising
political
nonentity
she
had
a
devoted
husband
some
blonde
teachable
children
and
a
look
of
unutterable
weariness
in
her
eyes
to
see
her
standing
at
the
top
of
an
expensively
horticultured
staircase
receiving
her
husband
s
guests
was
rather
like
watching
an
animal
performing
on
a
stage
one
always
tells
oneself
that
the
animal
likes
it
and
one
always
knows
that
it
doesn
t
lady
veula
is
an
ardent
free
trader
isn
t
she
someone
once
remarked
to
lady
caroline
i
wonder
said
lady
caroline
in
her
gently
questioning
voice
a
woman
whose
dresses
are
made
in
paris
and
whose
marriage
has
been
made
in
heaven
might
be
equally
biassed
for
and
against
free
lady
veula
looked
at
youghal
and
his
mount
with
slow
critical
appraisement
and
there
was
a
note
of
blended
raillery
and
wistfulness
in
her
voice
you
two
dear
things
i
should
love
to
stroke
you
both
but
i
m
not
sure
how
joyeuse
would
take
it
so
i
ll
stroke
you
down
verbally
instead
i
admired
your
attack
on
sir
edward
immensely
though
of
course
i
don
t
agree
with
a
word
of
it
your
description
of
him
building
a
hedge
round
the
german
cuckoo
and
hoping
he
was
isolating
it
was
rather
sweet
seriously
though
i
regard
him
as
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
so
do
i
said
youghal
the
misfortune
is
that
he
is
merely
propping
up
a
canvas
roof
it
s
just
his
regrettable
solidity
and
integrity
that
makes
him
so
expensively
dangerous
the
average
briton
arrives
at
the
same
judgment
about
roan
s
handling
of
foreign
affairs
as
omar
does
of
the
supreme
being
in
his
dealings
with
the
world
he
s
a
good
fellow
and
twill
all
be
lady
veula
laughed
lightly
my
party
is
in
power
so
i
may
exercise
the
privilege
of
being
optimistic
who
is
that
who
bowed
to
you
she
continued
as
a
dark
young
man
with
an
inclination
to
stoutness
passed
by
them
on
foot
i
ve
seen
him
about
a
good
deal
lately
he
s
been
to
one
or
two
of
my
andrei
drakoloff
said
youghal
he
s
just
produced
a
play
that
has
had
a
big
success
in
moscow
and
is
certain
to
be
extremely
popular
all
over
russia
in
the
first
three
acts
the
heroine
is
supposed
to
be
dying
of
consumption
in
the
last
act
they
find
she
is
really
dying
of
are
the
russians
really
such
a
gloomy
people
but
not
in
the
least
gloomy
they
merely
take
their
sadness
pleasurably
just
as
we
are
accused
of
taking
our
pleasures
sadly
have
you
noticed
that
dreadful
klopstock
youth
has
been
pounding
past
us
at
shortening
intervals
he
ll
come
up
and
talk
if
he
half
catches
your
i
only
just
know
him
isn
t
he
at
an
agricultural
college
or
something
of
the
sort
yes
studying
to
be
a
gentleman
farmer
he
told
me
i
didn
t
ask
if
both
subjects
were
you
re
really
rather
dreadful
said
lady
veula
trying
to
look
as
if
she
thought
so
remember
we
are
all
equal
in
the
sight
of
for
a
preacher
of
wholesome
truths
her
voice
rather
lacked
conviction
if
i
and
ernest
klopstock
are
really
equal
in
the
sight
of
heaven
said
youghal
with
intense
complacency
i
should
recommend
heaven
to
consult
an
eye
there
was
a
heavy
spattering
of
loose
earth
and
a
squelching
of
as
the
klopstock
youth
lumbered
up
to
the
rails
and
delivered
himself
of
loud
cheerful
greetings
joyeuse
laid
his
ears
well
back
as
the
ungainly
bay
cob
and
his
appropriately
matched
rider
drew
up
beside
him
his
verdict
was
reflected
and
endorsed
by
the
cold
stare
of
youghal
s
eyes
i
ve
been
having
a
nailing
fine
time
recounted
the
newcomer
with
clamorous
enthusiasm
i
was
over
in
paris
last
month
and
had
lots
of
strawberries
there
then
i
had
a
lot
more
in
london
and
now
i
ve
been
having
a
late
crop
of
them
in
herefordshire
so
i
ve
had
quite
a
lot
this
and
he
laughed
as
one
who
had
deserved
well
and
received
well
of
fate
the
charm
of
that
story
said
youghal
is
that
it
can
be
told
in
any
and
with
a
sweep
of
his
hat
to
lady
veula
he
turned
the
impatient
joyeuse
into
the
moving
stream
of
horse
and
horsemen
that
woman
reminds
me
of
some
verse
i
ve
read
and
liked
thought
youghal
as
joyeuse
sprang
into
a
light
showy
canter
that
gave
full
recognition
to
the
existence
of
observant
human
beings
along
the
side
walk
ah
i
have
and
he
quoted
almost
aloud
as
one
does
in
the
exhilaration
of
a
canter
how
much
i
loved
that
way
you
had
of
smiling
most
when
very
sad
a
smile
which
carried
tender
hints
of
sun
and
spring
and
yet
more
than
all
other
thing
of
weariness
beyond
all
and
having
satisfactorily
fitted
lady
veula
on
to
a
quotation
he
dismissed
her
from
his
mind
with
the
constancy
of
her
sex
she
thought
about
him
his
good
looks
and
his
youth
and
his
railing
tongue
till
late
in
the
afternoon
while
youghal
was
putting
joyeuse
through
his
paces
under
the
elm
trees
of
the
row
a
little
drama
in
which
he
was
directly
interested
was
being
played
out
not
many
hundred
yards
away
elaine
and
comus
were
indulging
themselves
in
two
pennyworths
of
park
chair
drawn
aside
just
a
little
from
the
serried
rows
of
sitters
who
were
set
out
like
bedded
plants
over
an
acre
or
so
of
turf
comus
was
for
the
moment
in
a
mood
of
pugnacious
gaiety
disbursing
a
fund
of
pointed
criticism
and
unsparing
anecdote
concerning
those
of
the
promenaders
or
loungers
whom
he
knew
personally
or
by
sight
elaine
was
rather
quieter
than
usual
and
the
grave
serenity
of
the
leonardo
da
vinci
portrait
seemed
intensified
in
her
face
this
morning
in
his
leisurely
courtship
comus
had
relied
almost
exclusively
on
his
physical
attraction
and
the
fitful
drollery
of
his
wit
and
high
spirits
and
these
graces
had
gone
far
to
make
him
seem
a
very
desirable
and
rather
lovable
thing
in
elaine
s
eyes
but
he
had
left
out
of
account
the
disfavour
which
he
constantly
risked
and
sometimes
incurred
from
his
frank
and
undisguised
indifference
to
other
people
s
interests
and
wishes
including
at
times
elaine
s
and
the
more
that
she
felt
that
she
liked
him
the
more
she
was
irritated
by
his
lack
of
consideration
for
her
without
expecting
that
her
every
wish
should
become
a
law
to
him
she
would
at
least
have
liked
it
to
reach
the
formality
of
a
second
reading
another
important
factor
he
had
also
left
out
of
his
reckoning
namely
the
presence
on
the
scene
of
another
suitor
who
also
had
youth
and
wit
to
recommend
him
and
who
certainly
did
not
lack
physical
attractions
comus
marching
carelessly
through
unknown
country
to
effect
what
seemed
already
an
assured
victory
made
the
mistake
of
disregarding
the
existence
of
an
unbeaten
army
on
his
flank
elaine
felt
that
without
having
actually
quarrelled
she
and
comus
had
drifted
a
little
bit
out
of
sympathy
with
one
another
the
fault
she
knew
was
scarcely
hers
in
fact
from
the
most
point
of
view
it
could
hardly
be
denied
that
it
was
almost
entirely
his
the
incident
of
the
silver
dish
had
lacked
even
the
attraction
of
novelty
it
had
been
one
of
a
series
all
bearing
a
strong
connecting
likeness
there
had
been
small
unrepaid
loans
which
elaine
would
not
have
grudged
in
themselves
though
the
application
for
them
brought
a
certain
qualm
of
distaste
with
the
perversity
which
seemed
inseparable
from
his
doings
comus
had
always
flung
away
a
portion
of
his
borrowings
in
some
ostentatious
piece
of
glaring
and
utterly
profitless
extravagance
which
outraged
all
the
canons
of
her
upbringing
without
bringing
him
an
atom
of
understandable
satisfaction
under
these
repeated
discouragements
it
was
not
surprising
that
some
small
part
of
her
affection
should
have
slipped
away
but
she
had
come
to
the
park
that
morning
with
an
unconfessed
expectation
of
being
gently
wooed
back
to
the
mood
of
gracious
forgetfulness
that
she
was
only
too
eager
to
assume
it
was
almost
worth
while
being
angry
with
comus
for
the
sake
of
experiencing
the
pleasure
of
being
coaxed
into
friendliness
again
with
the
charm
which
he
knew
so
well
how
to
exert
it
was
delicious
here
under
the
trees
on
this
perfect
june
morning
and
elaine
had
the
blessed
assurance
that
most
of
the
women
within
range
were
envying
her
the
companionship
of
the
handsome
youth
who
sat
by
her
side
with
special
complacence
she
contemplated
her
cousin
suzette
who
was
but
not
very
elatedly
basking
in
the
attentions
of
her
fiancé
an
young
man
who
was
superintendent
of
a
people
s
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
and
whose
clothes
comus
had
described
as
having
been
made
in
southwark
rather
than
in
anger
most
of
the
pleasures
in
life
must
be
paid
for
and
the
vendor
in
due
time
made
his
appearance
in
quest
of
pennies
comus
paid
him
from
out
of
a
varied
assortment
of
coins
and
then
balanced
the
remainder
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
elaine
felt
a
sudden
foreknowledge
of
something
disagreeable
about
to
happen
and
a
red
spot
deepened
in
her
cheeks
four
shillings
and
fivepence
and
a
said
comus
reflectively
it
s
a
ridiculous
sum
to
last
me
for
the
next
three
days
and
i
owe
a
card
debt
of
over
two
yes
commented
elaine
dryly
and
with
an
apparent
lack
of
interest
in
his
exchequer
statement
surely
she
was
thinking
hurriedly
to
herself
he
could
not
be
foolish
enough
to
broach
the
matter
of
another
loan
the
card
debt
is
rather
a
nuisance
pursued
comus
with
fatalistic
persistency
you
won
seven
pounds
last
week
didn
t
you
asked
elaine
don
t
you
put
by
any
of
your
winnings
to
balance
losses
the
four
shillings
and
the
fivepence
and
the
represent
the
rearguard
of
the
seven
pounds
said
comus
the
rest
have
fallen
by
the
way
if
i
can
pay
the
two
pounds
i
daresay
i
shall
win
something
more
to
go
on
with
i
m
holding
rather
good
cards
just
now
but
if
i
can
t
pay
it
of
course
i
shan
t
show
up
at
the
club
so
you
see
the
fix
i
am
elaine
took
no
notice
of
this
indirect
application
the
appeal
court
was
assembling
in
haste
to
consider
new
evidence
and
this
time
there
was
the
rapidity
of
sudden
determination
about
its
movement
the
conversation
strayed
away
from
the
fateful
topic
for
a
few
moments
and
then
comus
brought
it
deliberately
back
to
the
danger
zone
it
would
be
awfully
nice
if
you
would
let
me
have
a
fiver
for
a
few
days
elaine
he
said
quickly
if
you
don
t
i
really
don
t
know
what
i
shall
if
you
are
really
bothered
about
your
card
debt
i
will
send
you
the
two
pounds
by
messenger
boy
early
this
she
spoke
quietly
and
with
great
decision
and
i
shall
not
be
at
the
connor
s
dance
she
continued
it
s
too
hot
for
dancing
i
m
going
home
now
please
don
t
bother
to
accompany
me
i
particularly
wish
to
go
comus
saw
that
he
had
overstepped
the
mark
of
her
good
nature
wisely
he
made
no
immediate
attempt
to
force
himself
back
into
her
good
graces
he
would
wait
till
her
indignation
had
cooled
his
tactics
would
have
been
excellent
if
he
had
not
forgotten
that
unbeaten
army
on
his
flank
elaine
de
frey
had
known
very
clearly
what
qualities
she
had
wanted
in
comus
and
she
had
known
against
all
efforts
at
that
he
fell
far
short
of
those
qualities
she
had
been
willing
to
lower
her
standard
of
moral
requirements
in
proportion
as
she
was
fond
of
the
boy
but
there
was
a
point
beyond
which
she
would
not
go
he
had
hurt
her
pride
besides
alarming
her
sense
of
caution
suzette
on
whom
she
felt
a
thoroughly
justified
tendency
to
look
down
had
at
any
rate
an
attentive
and
considerate
lover
elaine
walked
towards
the
park
gates
feeling
that
in
one
essential
suzette
possessed
something
that
had
been
denied
to
her
and
at
the
gates
she
met
joyeuse
and
his
spruce
young
rider
preparing
to
turn
homeward
get
rid
of
joyeuse
and
come
and
take
me
out
to
lunch
somewhere
demanded
elaine
how
jolly
said
youghal
let
s
go
to
the
corridor
restaurant
the
head
waiter
there
is
an
old
viennese
friend
of
mine
and
looks
after
me
beautifully
i
ve
never
been
there
with
a
lady
before
and
he
s
sure
to
ask
me
afterwards
in
his
fatherly
way
if
we
re
the
lunch
was
a
success
in
every
way
there
was
just
enough
orchestral
effort
to
immerse
the
conversation
without
drowning
it
and
youghal
was
an
attentive
and
inspired
host
through
an
open
doorway
elaine
could
see
the
café
with
its
imposing
array
of
freie
and
other
exotic
newspapers
hanging
on
the
wall
she
looked
across
at
the
young
man
seated
opposite
her
who
gave
one
the
impression
of
having
centred
the
most
serious
efforts
of
his
brain
on
his
toilet
and
his
food
and
recalled
some
of
the
flattering
remarks
that
the
press
had
bestowed
on
his
recent
speeches
doesn
t
it
make
you
conceited
courtenay
she
asked
to
look
at
all
those
foreign
newspapers
hanging
there
and
know
that
most
of
them
have
got
paragraphs
and
articles
about
your
persian
speech
youghal
laughed
there
s
always
a
chastening
corrective
in
the
thought
that
some
of
them
may
have
printed
your
portrait
when
once
you
ve
seen
your
features
hurriedly
reproduced
in
the
for
instance
you
feel
you
would
like
to
be
a
veiled
turkish
woman
for
the
rest
of
your
and
youghal
gazed
long
and
lovingly
at
his
reflection
in
the
nearest
mirror
as
an
antidote
against
possible
incitements
to
humility
in
the
portrait
gallery
of
fame
elaine
felt
a
certain
soothed
satisfaction
in
the
fact
that
this
young
man
whose
knowledge
of
the
middle
east
was
an
embarrassment
to
ministers
at
question
time
and
in
debate
was
showing
himself
equally
on
the
subject
of
her
culinary
likes
and
dislikes
if
suzette
could
have
been
forced
to
attend
as
a
witness
at
a
neighbouring
table
she
would
have
felt
even
happier
did
the
head
waiter
ask
if
we
were
engaged
asked
elaine
when
courtenay
had
settled
the
bill
and
she
had
finished
collecting
her
sunshade
and
gloves
and
other
impedimenta
from
the
hands
of
obsequious
attendants
yes
said
youghal
and
he
seemed
quite
crestfallen
when
i
had
to
say
it
would
be
horrid
to
disappoint
him
when
he
s
looked
after
us
so
charmingly
said
elaine
tell
him
that
we
chapter
x
the
rutland
galleries
were
crowded
especially
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
by
a
fashionable
throng
of
which
had
gathered
to
inspect
mervyn
quentock
s
collection
of
society
portraits
quentock
was
a
young
artist
whose
abilities
were
just
receiving
due
recognition
from
the
critics
that
the
recognition
was
not
overdue
he
owed
largely
to
his
perception
of
the
fact
that
if
one
hides
one
s
talent
under
a
bushel
one
must
be
careful
to
point
out
to
everyone
the
exact
bushel
under
which
it
is
hidden
there
are
two
manners
of
receiving
recognition
one
is
to
be
discovered
so
long
after
one
s
death
that
one
s
grandchildren
have
to
write
to
the
papers
to
establish
their
relationship
the
other
is
to
be
discovered
like
the
infant
moses
at
the
very
outset
of
one
s
career
mervyn
quentock
had
chosen
the
latter
and
happier
manner
in
an
age
when
many
aspiring
young
men
strive
to
advertise
their
wares
by
imparting
to
them
a
freakish
imbecility
quentock
turned
out
work
that
was
characterised
by
a
pleasing
delicate
restraint
but
he
contrived
to
herald
his
output
with
a
certain
fanfare
of
personal
eccentricity
thereby
compelling
an
attention
which
might
otherwise
have
strayed
past
his
studio
in
appearance
he
was
the
ordinary
cleanly
young
englishman
except
perhaps
that
his
eyes
rather
suggested
a
library
edition
of
the
arabian
nights
his
clothes
matched
his
appearance
and
showed
no
taint
of
the
sartorial
disorder
by
which
the
bourgeois
of
the
and
the
latin
quarter
anxiously
seeks
to
proclaim
his
kinship
with
art
and
thought
his
eccentricity
took
the
form
of
flying
in
the
face
of
some
of
the
prevailing
social
currents
of
the
day
but
as
a
reactionary
never
as
a
reformer
he
produced
a
gasp
of
admiring
astonishment
in
fashionable
circles
by
refusing
to
paint
of
course
those
who
had
left
the
legitimate
drama
to
appear
between
the
boards
of
debrett
he
absolutely
declined
to
execute
portraits
of
americans
unless
they
hailed
from
certain
favoured
states
his
as
a
new
york
paper
phrased
it
earned
for
him
a
crop
of
angry
criticisms
and
a
shoal
of
transatlantic
commissions
and
criticism
and
commissions
were
the
things
that
quentock
most
wanted
of
course
he
is
perfectly
right
said
lady
caroline
benaresq
calmly
rescuing
a
plate
of
caviare
sandwiches
from
the
neighbourhood
of
a
trio
of
young
ladies
who
had
established
themselves
hopefully
within
easy
reach
of
it
art
she
continued
addressing
herself
to
the
rev
poltimore
vardon
has
always
been
geographically
exclusive
london
may
be
more
important
from
most
points
of
view
than
venice
but
the
art
of
portrait
painting
which
would
never
concern
itself
with
a
lord
mayor
simply
grovels
at
the
feet
of
the
doges
as
a
socialist
i
m
bound
to
recognise
the
right
of
ealing
to
compare
itself
with
avignon
but
one
can
not
expect
the
muses
to
put
the
two
on
a
exclusiveness
said
the
reverend
poltimore
has
been
the
salvation
of
art
just
as
the
lack
of
it
is
proving
the
downfall
of
religion
my
colleagues
of
the
cloth
go
about
zealously
proclaiming
the
fact
that
christianity
in
some
form
or
other
is
attracting
shoals
of
converts
among
all
sorts
of
races
and
tribes
that
one
had
scarcely
ever
heard
of
except
in
reviews
of
books
of
travel
that
one
never
read
that
sort
of
thing
was
all
very
well
when
the
world
was
more
sparsely
populated
but
nowadays
when
it
simply
teems
with
human
beings
no
one
is
particularly
impressed
by
the
fact
that
a
few
million
more
or
less
of
converts
of
a
low
stage
of
mental
development
have
accepted
the
teachings
of
some
particular
religion
it
not
only
chills
one
s
enthusiasm
it
positively
shakes
one
s
convictions
when
one
hears
that
the
things
one
has
been
brought
up
to
believe
as
true
are
being
very
favourably
spoken
of
by
buriats
and
samoyeds
and
the
rev
poltimore
vardon
had
once
seen
a
resemblance
in
himself
to
voltaire
and
had
lived
alongside
the
comparison
ever
since
no
modern
cult
or
fashion
he
continued
would
be
favourably
influenced
by
considerations
based
on
statistics
fancy
adopting
a
certain
style
of
hat
or
cut
of
coat
because
it
was
being
largely
worn
in
lancashire
and
the
midlands
fancy
favouring
a
certain
brand
of
champagne
because
it
was
being
extensively
patronised
in
german
summer
resorts
no
wonder
that
religion
is
falling
into
disuse
in
this
country
under
such
you
can
t
prevent
the
heathen
being
converted
if
they
choose
to
be
said
lady
caroline
this
is
an
age
of
you
could
always
deny
it
said
the
rev
poltimore
like
the
belgians
do
with
regrettable
occurrences
in
the
congo
but
i
would
go
further
than
that
i
would
stimulate
the
waning
enthusiasm
for
christianity
in
this
country
by
labelling
it
as
the
exclusive
possession
of
a
privileged
few
if
one
could
induce
the
duchess
of
pelm
for
instance
to
assert
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
as
far
as
the
british
isles
are
concerned
is
strictly
limited
to
herself
two
of
the
at
pelmby
and
possibly
but
not
certainly
the
dean
of
dunster
there
would
be
an
instant
reshaping
of
the
popular
attitude
towards
religious
convictions
and
observances
once
let
the
idea
get
about
that
the
christian
church
is
rather
more
exclusive
than
the
lawn
at
ascot
and
you
would
have
a
quickening
of
religious
life
such
as
this
generation
has
never
witnessed
but
as
long
as
the
clergy
and
the
religious
organisations
advertise
their
creed
on
the
lines
of
everybody
ought
to
believe
in
us
millions
do
one
can
expect
nothing
but
indifference
and
waning
time
is
just
as
exclusive
in
its
way
as
art
said
lady
caroline
in
what
way
said
the
reverend
poltimore
your
pleasantries
about
religion
would
have
sounded
quite
clever
and
advanced
in
the
early
nineties
they
have
a
dreadfully
flavour
that
is
the
great
delusion
of
you
advanced
satirists
you
imagine
you
can
sit
down
comfortably
for
a
couple
of
decades
saying
daring
and
startling
things
about
the
age
you
live
in
which
whatever
other
defects
it
may
have
is
certainly
not
standing
still
the
whole
of
the
sherard
blaw
school
of
discursive
drama
suggests
to
my
mind
early
victorian
furniture
in
a
travelling
circus
however
you
will
always
have
relays
of
people
from
the
suburbs
to
listen
to
the
mocking
bird
of
yesterday
and
sincerely
imagine
it
is
the
harbinger
of
something
new
and
you
mind
passing
that
plate
of
sandwiches
asked
one
of
the
trio
of
young
ladies
emboldened
by
famine
with
pleasure
said
lady
caroline
deftly
passing
her
a
nearly
empty
plate
of
i
meant
the
place
of
caviare
sandwiches
so
sorry
to
trouble
you
persisted
the
young
lady
her
sorrow
was
misapplied
lady
caroline
had
turned
her
attention
to
a
newcomer
a
very
interesting
exhibition
ada
spelvexit
was
saying
faultless
technique
as
far
as
i
am
a
judge
of
technique
and
quite
a
in
the
way
of
poses
but
have
you
noticed
how
very
animal
his
art
is
he
seems
to
shut
out
the
soul
from
his
portraits
i
nearly
cried
when
i
saw
dear
winifred
depicted
simply
as
a
healthy
i
wish
you
had
said
lady
caroline
the
spectacle
of
a
strong
brave
woman
weeping
at
a
private
view
in
the
rutland
galleries
would
have
been
so
sensational
it
would
certainly
have
been
reproduced
in
the
next
drury
lane
drama
and
i
m
so
unlucky
i
never
see
these
sensational
events
i
was
ill
with
appendicitis
you
know
when
lulu
braminguard
dramatically
forgave
her
husband
after
seventeen
years
of
estrangement
during
a
state
luncheon
party
at
windsor
the
old
queen
was
furious
about
it
she
said
it
was
so
disrespectful
to
the
cook
to
be
thinking
of
such
a
thing
at
such
a
lady
caroline
s
recollections
of
things
that
hadn
t
happened
at
the
court
of
queen
victoria
were
notoriously
vivid
it
was
the
very
widespread
fear
that
she
might
one
day
write
a
book
of
reminiscences
that
made
her
so
universally
respected
as
for
his
picture
of
lady
brickfield
continued
ada
ignoring
lady
caroline
s
commentary
as
far
as
possible
all
the
expression
seems
to
have
been
deliberately
concentrated
in
the
feet
beautiful
feet
no
doubt
but
still
hardly
the
most
distinctive
part
of
a
human
to
paint
the
right
people
at
the
wrong
end
may
be
an
eccentricity
but
it
is
scarcely
an
indiscretion
pronounced
lady
caroline
one
of
the
portraits
which
attracted
more
than
a
passing
flutter
of
attention
was
a
costume
study
of
francesca
bassington
francesca
had
secured
some
highly
desirable
patronage
for
the
young
artist
and
in
return
he
had
enriched
her
pantheon
of
personal
possessions
with
a
clever
piece
of
work
into
which
he
had
thrown
an
unusual
amount
of
imaginative
detail
he
had
painted
her
in
a
costume
of
the
great
louis
s
brightest
period
seated
in
front
of
a
tapestry
that
was
so
prominent
in
the
composition
that
it
could
scarcely
be
said
to
form
part
of
the
background
flowers
and
fruit
in
exotic
profusion
were
its
dominant
note
quinces
pomegranates
giant
convolvulus
great
roses
and
grapes
that
were
already
being
pressed
by
gleeful
cupids
in
a
riotous
arcadian
vintage
stood
out
on
its
woven
texture
the
same
note
was
struck
in
the
beflowered
satin
of
the
lady
s
kirtle
and
in
the
pomegranate
pattern
of
the
brocade
that
draped
the
couch
on
which
she
was
seated
the
artist
had
called
his
picture
and
after
one
had
taken
in
all
the
details
of
fruit
and
flower
and
foliage
that
earned
the
composition
its
name
one
noted
the
landscape
that
showed
through
a
broad
casement
in
the
corner
it
was
a
landscape
clutched
in
the
grip
of
winter
naked
bleak
a
winter
in
which
things
died
and
knew
no
rewakening
if
the
picture
typified
harvest
it
was
a
harvest
of
artificial
growth
it
leaves
a
great
deal
to
the
imagination
doesn
t
it
said
ada
spelvexit
who
had
edged
away
from
the
range
of
lady
caroline
s
tongue
at
any
rate
one
can
tell
who
it
s
meant
for
said
serena
golackly
oh
yes
it
s
a
good
likeness
of
dear
francesca
admitted
ada
of
course
it
flatters
that
too
is
a
fault
on
the
right
side
in
portrait
painting
said
serena
after
all
if
posterity
is
going
to
stare
at
one
for
centuries
it
s
only
kind
and
reasonable
to
be
looking
just
a
little
better
than
one
s
what
a
curiously
unequal
style
the
artist
has
continued
ada
almost
as
if
she
felt
a
personal
grievance
against
him
i
was
just
noticing
what
a
lack
of
soul
there
was
in
most
of
his
portraits
dear
winifred
you
know
who
speaks
so
beautifully
and
feelingly
at
my
gatherings
for
old
women
he
s
made
her
look
just
an
ordinary
blonde
and
francesca
who
is
quite
the
most
soulless
woman
i
ve
ever
met
well
he
s
given
her
hush
said
serena
the
bassington
boy
is
just
behind
comus
stood
looking
at
the
portrait
of
his
mother
with
the
feeling
of
one
who
comes
suddenly
across
a
acquaintance
in
unfamiliar
surroundings
the
likeness
was
undoubtedly
a
good
one
but
the
artist
had
caught
an
expression
in
francesca
s
eyes
which
few
people
had
ever
seen
there
it
was
the
expression
of
a
woman
who
had
forgotten
for
one
short
moment
to
be
absorbed
in
the
small
cares
and
excitements
of
her
life
the
money
worries
and
little
social
plannings
and
had
found
time
to
send
a
look
of
friendliness
to
some
sympathetic
companion
comus
could
recall
that
look
fitful
and
fleeting
in
his
mother
s
eyes
when
she
had
been
a
few
years
younger
before
her
world
had
grown
to
be
such
a
of
ways
and
means
almost
as
a
he
remembered
that
she
had
once
figured
in
his
boyish
mind
as
a
rather
good
sort
more
ready
to
see
the
laughable
side
of
a
piece
of
mischief
than
to
labour
forth
a
reproof
that
the
bygone
feeling
of
good
fellowship
had
been
stamped
out
was
he
knew
probably
in
great
part
his
own
doing
and
it
was
possible
that
the
old
friendliness
was
still
there
under
the
surface
of
things
ready
to
show
itself
again
if
he
willed
it
and
friends
were
becoming
scarcer
with
him
than
enemies
in
these
days
looking
at
the
picture
with
its
wistful
hint
of
a
long
ago
comradeship
comus
made
up
his
mind
that
he
very
much
wanted
things
to
be
back
on
their
earlier
footing
and
to
see
again
on
his
mother
s
face
the
look
that
the
artist
had
caught
and
perpetuated
in
its
momentary
flitting
if
the
projected
came
off
and
in
spite
of
recent
maladroit
behaviour
on
his
part
he
still
counted
it
an
assured
thing
much
of
the
immediate
cause
for
estrangement
between
himself
and
his
mother
would
be
removed
or
at
any
rate
easily
removable
with
the
influence
of
elaine
s
money
behind
him
he
promised
himself
that
he
would
find
some
occupation
that
would
remove
from
himself
the
reproach
of
being
a
waster
and
idler
there
were
lots
of
careers
he
told
himself
that
were
open
to
a
man
with
solid
financial
backing
and
good
connections
there
might
yet
be
jolly
times
ahead
in
which
his
mother
would
have
her
share
of
the
good
things
that
were
going
and
carking
henry
greech
and
other
of
comus
s
detractors
could
take
their
sour
looks
and
words
out
of
sight
and
hearing
thus
staring
at
the
picture
as
though
he
were
studying
its
every
detail
and
seeing
really
only
that
wistful
friendly
smile
comus
made
his
plans
and
dispositions
for
a
battle
that
was
already
fought
and
lost
the
crowd
grew
thicker
in
the
galleries
cheerfully
enduring
an
amount
of
overcrowding
that
would
have
been
fiercely
resented
in
a
railway
carriage
near
the
entrance
mervyn
quentock
was
talking
to
a
serene
highness
a
lady
who
led
a
life
of
obtrusive
usefulness
largely
imposed
on
her
by
a
inability
to
say
that
woman
creates
a
positive
draught
with
the
number
of
bazaars
she
opens
a
minister
had
once
remarked
at
the
present
moment
she
was
being
whimsically
apologetic
when
i
think
of
the
legions
of
young
men
and
women
to
whom
i
ve
given
away
prizes
for
proficiency
in
curriculum
i
feel
that
i
ought
not
to
show
my
face
inside
a
picture
gallery
i
always
imagine
that
my
punishment
in
another
world
will
be
perpetually
sharpening
pencils
and
cleaning
palettes
for
unending
relays
of
misguided
young
people
whom
i
deliberately
encouraged
in
their
artistic
do
you
suppose
we
shall
all
get
appropriate
punishments
in
another
world
for
our
sins
in
this
asked
quentock
not
so
much
for
our
sins
as
for
our
indiscretions
they
are
the
things
which
do
the
most
harm
and
cause
the
greatest
trouble
i
feel
certain
that
christopher
columbus
will
undergo
the
endless
torment
of
being
discovered
by
parties
of
american
tourists
you
see
i
am
quite
old
fashioned
in
my
ideas
about
the
terrors
and
inconveniences
of
the
next
world
and
now
i
must
be
running
away
i
ve
got
to
open
a
free
library
somewhere
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
that
unveils
a
bust
of
carlyle
and
makes
a
speech
about
ruskin
and
then
people
come
in
their
thousands
and
read
rabid
ralph
or
should
he
have
bitten
her
don
t
forget
please
i
m
going
to
have
the
medallion
with
the
fat
cupid
sitting
on
a
sundial
and
just
one
thing
i
ought
not
to
ask
you
but
you
have
such
nice
kind
eyes
you
embolden
one
to
make
daring
requests
would
you
send
me
the
recipe
for
those
lovely
sandwiches
i
know
the
ingredients
of
course
but
it
s
the
proportions
that
make
such
a
how
much
liver
to
how
much
chestnut
and
what
amount
of
red
pepper
and
other
things
thank
you
so
much
i
really
am
going
staring
round
with
a
vague
at
everybody
within
nodding
distance
her
serene
highness
made
one
of
her
characteristic
exits
which
lady
caroline
declared
always
reminded
her
of
a
scrambled
egg
slipping
off
a
piece
of
toast
at
the
entrance
she
stopped
for
a
moment
to
exchange
a
word
or
two
with
a
young
man
who
had
just
arrived
from
a
corner
where
he
was
momentarily
hemmed
in
by
a
group
of
dowagers
comus
recognised
the
newcomer
as
courtenay
youghal
and
began
slowly
to
labour
his
way
towards
him
youghal
was
not
at
the
moment
the
person
whose
society
he
most
craved
for
in
the
world
but
there
was
at
least
the
possibility
that
he
might
provide
an
opportunity
for
a
game
of
bridge
which
was
the
dominant
desire
of
the
moment
the
young
politician
was
already
surrounded
by
a
group
of
friends
and
acquaintances
and
was
evidently
being
made
the
recipient
of
a
salvo
of
on
his
recent
performances
in
the
foreign
office
debate
comus
concluded
but
youghal
himself
seemed
to
be
announcing
the
event
with
which
the
congratulations
were
connected
had
some
dramatic
catastrophe
overtaken
the
government
comus
wondered
and
then
as
he
pressed
nearer
a
chance
word
the
coupling
of
two
names
told
him
the
news
chapter
xi
after
the
momentous
lunch
at
the
corridor
restaurant
elaine
had
returned
to
manchester
square
where
she
was
staying
with
one
of
her
numerous
aunts
in
a
frame
of
mind
that
embraced
a
tangle
of
competing
emotions
in
the
first
place
she
was
conscious
of
a
dominant
feeling
of
relief
in
a
moment
of
impetuosity
not
wholly
uninfluenced
by
pique
she
had
settled
the
problem
which
hours
of
hard
thinking
and
serious
had
brought
no
nearer
to
solution
and
although
she
felt
just
a
little
inclined
to
be
scared
at
the
headlong
manner
of
her
final
decision
she
had
now
very
little
doubt
in
her
own
mind
that
the
decision
had
been
the
right
one
in
fact
the
wonder
seemed
rather
that
she
should
have
been
so
long
in
doubt
as
to
which
of
her
wooers
really
enjoyed
her
honest
approval
she
had
been
in
love
these
many
weeks
past
with
an
imaginary
comus
but
now
that
she
had
definitely
walked
out
of
her
dreamland
she
saw
that
nearly
all
the
qualities
that
had
appealed
to
her
on
his
behalf
had
been
absent
from
or
only
fitfully
present
in
the
character
of
the
real
comus
and
now
that
she
had
installed
youghal
in
the
first
place
of
her
affections
he
had
rapidly
acquired
in
her
eyes
some
of
the
qualities
which
ranked
highest
in
her
estimation
like
the
proverbial
buyer
she
had
the
happy
feminine
tendency
of
magnifying
the
worth
of
her
possession
as
soon
as
she
had
acquired
it
and
courtenay
youghal
gave
elaine
some
justification
for
her
sense
of
having
chosen
wisely
above
all
other
things
selfish
and
cynical
though
he
might
appear
at
times
he
was
unfailingly
courteous
and
considerate
towards
her
that
was
a
circumstance
which
would
always
have
carried
weight
with
her
in
judging
any
man
in
this
case
its
value
was
enormously
heightened
by
contrast
with
the
behaviour
of
her
other
wooer
and
youghal
had
in
her
eyes
the
advantage
which
the
glamour
of
combat
even
the
combat
of
words
and
throws
over
the
fighter
he
stood
well
in
the
forefront
of
a
battle
which
however
carefully
however
honeycombed
with
personal
insincerities
and
overlaid
with
calculated
really
meant
something
really
counted
for
good
or
wrong
in
the
nation
s
development
and
the
world
s
history
shrewd
parliamentary
observers
might
have
warned
her
that
youghal
would
never
stand
much
higher
in
the
political
world
than
he
did
at
present
as
a
brilliant
opposition
freelance
leading
lively
and
rather
meaningless
forays
against
the
dull
and
rather
purposeless
foreign
policy
of
a
government
that
was
scarcely
either
to
be
blamed
for
or
congratulated
on
its
handling
of
foreign
affairs
the
young
politician
had
not
the
strength
of
character
or
convictions
that
keeps
a
man
naturally
in
the
forefront
of
affairs
and
gives
his
counsels
a
sterling
value
and
on
the
other
hand
his
insincerity
was
not
deep
enough
to
allow
him
to
pose
artificially
and
successfully
as
a
leader
of
men
and
shaper
of
movements
for
the
moment
however
his
place
in
public
life
was
sufficiently
marked
out
to
give
him
a
secure
footing
in
that
world
where
people
are
counted
individually
and
not
in
herds
the
woman
whom
he
would
make
his
wife
would
have
the
chance
too
if
she
had
the
will
and
the
skill
to
become
an
individual
who
counted
there
was
balm
to
elaine
in
this
reflection
yet
it
did
not
wholly
suffice
to
drive
out
the
feeling
of
pique
which
comus
had
called
into
being
by
his
slighting
view
of
her
as
a
convenient
cash
supply
in
moments
of
emergency
she
found
a
certain
satisfaction
in
scrupulously
observing
her
promise
made
earlier
on
that
eventful
day
and
sent
off
a
messenger
with
the
stipulated
loan
then
a
reaction
of
compunction
set
in
and
she
reminded
herself
that
in
fairness
she
ought
to
write
and
tell
her
news
in
as
friendly
a
fashion
as
possible
to
her
dismissed
suitor
before
it
burst
upon
him
from
some
other
quarter
they
had
parted
on
more
or
less
quarrelling
terms
it
was
true
but
neither
of
them
had
foreseen
the
finality
of
the
parting
nor
the
permanence
of
the
breach
between
them
comus
might
even
now
be
thinking
himself
and
the
awakening
would
be
rather
cruel
the
letter
however
did
not
prove
an
easy
one
to
write
not
only
did
it
present
difficulties
of
its
own
but
it
suffered
from
the
competing
urgency
of
a
desire
to
be
doing
something
far
pleasanter
than
writing
explanatory
and
valedictory
phrases
elaine
was
possessed
with
an
unusual
but
quite
overmastering
hankering
to
visit
her
cousin
suzette
brankley
they
met
but
rarely
at
each
other
s
houses
and
very
seldom
anywhere
else
and
elaine
for
her
part
was
never
conscious
of
feeling
that
their
opportunities
for
intercourse
lacked
anything
in
the
way
of
adequacy
suzette
accorded
her
just
that
touch
of
patronage
which
a
moderately
and
immoderately
dull
girl
will
usually
try
to
mete
out
to
an
acquaintance
who
is
known
to
be
wealthy
and
suspected
of
possessing
brains
in
return
elaine
armed
herself
with
that
particular
brand
of
mock
humility
which
can
be
so
terribly
disconcerting
if
properly
wielded
no
quarrel
of
any
description
stood
between
them
and
one
could
not
legitimately
have
described
them
as
enemies
but
they
never
disarmed
in
one
another
s
presence
a
misfortune
of
any
magnitude
falling
on
one
of
them
would
have
been
sincerely
regretted
by
the
other
but
any
minor
discomfiture
would
have
produced
a
feeling
very
much
akin
to
satisfaction
human
nature
knows
millions
of
these
inconsequent
little
feuds
springing
up
and
flourishing
apart
from
any
basis
of
racial
political
religious
or
economic
causes
as
a
hint
perhaps
to
crass
unseeing
altruists
that
enmity
has
its
place
and
purpose
in
the
world
as
well
as
benevolence
elaine
had
not
personally
congratulated
suzette
since
the
formal
announcement
of
her
engagement
to
the
young
man
with
the
dissentient
tailoring
effects
the
impulse
to
go
and
do
so
now
overmastered
her
sense
of
what
was
due
to
comus
in
the
way
of
explanation
the
letter
was
still
in
its
blank
unwritten
stage
an
unmarshalled
sequence
of
sentences
forming
in
her
brain
when
she
ordered
her
car
and
made
a
hurried
but
change
into
her
most
sumptuously
sober
afternoon
toilette
suzette
she
felt
tolerably
sure
would
still
be
in
the
costume
that
she
had
worn
in
the
park
that
morning
a
costume
that
aimed
at
elaboration
of
detail
and
was
damned
with
overmuch
success
suzette
s
mother
welcomed
her
unexpected
visitor
with
obvious
satisfaction
her
daughter
s
engagement
she
explained
was
not
so
brilliant
from
the
social
point
of
view
as
a
girl
of
suzette
s
attractions
and
advantages
might
have
legitimately
aspired
to
but
egbert
was
a
thoroughly
commendable
and
dependable
young
man
who
would
very
probably
win
his
way
before
long
to
membership
of
the
county
council
from
there
of
course
the
road
would
be
open
to
him
to
higher
yes
said
elaine
he
might
become
an
have
you
seen
their
photographs
taken
together
asked
brankley
abandoning
the
subject
of
egbert
s
prospective
career
no
do
show
me
said
elaine
with
a
flattering
show
of
interest
i
ve
never
seen
that
sort
of
thing
before
it
used
to
be
the
fashion
once
for
engaged
couples
to
be
photographed
together
didn
t
it
it
s
much
the
fashion
now
said
brankley
assertively
but
some
of
the
complacency
had
filtered
out
of
her
voice
suzette
came
into
the
room
wearing
the
dress
that
she
had
worn
in
the
park
that
morning
of
course
you
ve
been
hearing
all
about
engagement
from
mother
she
cried
and
then
set
to
work
conscientiously
to
cover
the
same
ground
we
met
at
grindelwald
you
know
he
always
calls
me
his
ice
maiden
because
we
first
got
to
know
each
other
on
the
skating
rink
quite
romantic
wasn
t
it
then
we
asked
him
to
tea
one
day
and
we
got
to
be
quite
friendly
then
he
he
wasn
t
the
only
one
who
was
smitten
with
suzette
brankley
hastened
to
put
in
fearful
lest
elaine
might
suppose
that
egbert
had
had
things
all
his
own
way
there
was
an
american
millionaire
who
was
quite
taken
with
her
and
a
polish
count
of
a
very
old
family
i
assure
you
i
felt
quite
nervous
at
some
of
our
brankley
had
given
grindelwald
a
sinister
but
rather
alluring
reputation
among
a
large
circle
of
untravelled
friends
as
a
place
where
the
insolence
of
birth
and
wealth
was
held
in
precarious
check
from
breaking
forth
into
scenes
of
savage
violence
my
marriage
with
egbert
will
of
course
enlarge
the
sphere
of
my
life
enormously
pursued
suzette
yes
said
elaine
her
eyes
were
rather
remorselessly
taking
in
the
details
of
her
cousin
s
toilette
it
is
said
that
nothing
is
sadder
than
victory
except
defeat
suzette
began
to
feel
that
the
tragedy
of
both
was
concentrated
in
the
creation
which
had
given
her
such
unalloyed
gratification
till
elaine
had
come
on
the
scene
a
woman
can
be
so
immensely
helpful
in
the
social
way
to
a
man
who
is
making
a
career
for
himself
and
i
m
so
glad
to
find
that
we
ve
a
great
many
ideas
in
common
we
each
made
out
a
list
of
our
idea
of
the
hundred
best
books
and
quite
a
number
of
them
were
the
he
looks
bookish
said
elaine
with
a
critical
glance
at
the
photograph
oh
he
s
not
at
all
a
bookworm
said
suzette
quickly
though
he
s
tremendously
he
s
quite
the
man
of
does
he
hunt
asked
elaine
no
he
doesn
t
get
much
time
or
opportunity
for
what
a
pity
commented
elaine
i
don
t
think
i
could
marry
a
man
who
wasn
t
fond
of
of
course
that
s
a
matter
of
taste
said
suzette
stiffly
horsey
men
are
not
usually
gifted
with
overmuch
brains
are
they
there
is
as
much
difference
between
a
horseman
and
a
horsey
man
as
there
is
between
a
man
and
a
dressy
one
said
elaine
judicially
and
you
may
have
noticed
how
seldom
a
dressy
woman
really
knows
how
to
dress
as
an
old
lady
of
my
acquaintance
observed
the
other
day
some
people
are
born
with
a
sense
of
how
to
clothe
themselves
others
acquire
it
others
look
as
if
their
clothes
had
been
thrust
upon
she
gave
lady
caroline
her
due
quotation
marks
but
the
sudden
tactfulness
with
which
she
looked
away
from
her
cousin
s
frock
was
entirely
her
own
idea
a
young
man
entering
the
room
at
this
moment
caused
a
diversion
that
was
rather
welcome
to
suzette
here
comes
egbert
she
announced
with
an
air
of
subdued
triumph
it
was
at
least
a
satisfaction
to
be
able
to
produce
the
captive
of
her
charms
alive
and
in
good
condition
on
the
scene
elaine
might
be
as
critical
as
she
pleased
but
a
live
lover
outweighed
any
number
of
cavaliers
who
existed
only
as
a
distant
vision
of
the
delectable
husband
egbert
was
one
of
those
men
who
have
no
small
talk
but
possess
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
the
larger
variety
in
whatever
society
he
happened
to
be
and
particularly
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
an
table
with
a
limited
audience
of
womenfolk
he
gave
the
impression
of
someone
who
was
addressing
a
public
meeting
and
would
be
happy
to
answer
questions
afterwards
a
suggestion
of
wet
umbrellas
and
discreet
applause
seemed
to
accompany
him
everywhere
he
was
an
exponent
among
other
things
of
what
he
called
new
thought
which
seemed
to
lend
itself
conveniently
to
the
employment
of
a
good
deal
of
rather
stale
phraseology
probably
in
the
course
of
some
thirty
odd
years
of
existence
he
had
never
been
of
any
notable
use
to
man
woman
child
or
animal
but
it
was
his
intention
to
leave
the
world
a
better
happier
purer
place
than
he
had
found
it
against
the
danger
of
any
relapse
to
earlier
conditions
after
his
disappearance
from
the
scene
he
was
of
course
powerless
to
guard
tis
not
in
mortals
to
insure
succession
and
egbert
was
admittedly
mortal
elaine
found
him
immensely
entertaining
and
would
certainly
have
exerted
herself
to
draw
him
out
if
such
a
proceeding
had
been
at
all
necessary
she
listened
to
his
conversation
with
the
complacent
appreciation
that
one
bestows
on
a
stage
tragedy
from
whose
calamities
one
can
escape
at
any
moment
by
the
simple
process
of
leaving
one
s
seat
when
at
last
he
checked
the
flow
of
his
opinions
by
a
hurried
reference
to
his
watch
and
declared
that
he
must
be
moving
on
elsewhere
elaine
almost
expected
a
vote
of
thanks
to
be
accorded
him
or
to
be
asked
to
signify
herself
in
favour
of
some
resolution
by
holding
up
her
hand
when
the
young
man
had
bidden
the
company
a
rapid
farewell
tempered
in
suzette
s
case
by
the
exact
degree
of
tender
intimacy
that
it
would
have
been
considered
improper
to
omit
or
overstep
elaine
turned
to
her
expectant
cousin
with
an
air
of
cordial
congratulation
he
is
exactly
the
husband
i
should
have
chosen
for
you
for
the
second
time
that
afternoon
suzette
felt
a
sense
of
waning
enthusiasm
for
one
of
her
possessions
brankley
detected
the
note
of
ironical
congratulation
in
her
visitor
s
verdict
i
suppose
she
means
he
s
not
her
idea
of
a
husband
but
he
s
good
enough
for
suzette
she
observed
to
herself
with
a
snort
that
expressed
itself
somewhere
in
the
nostrils
of
the
brain
then
with
a
smiling
air
of
heavy
patronage
she
delivered
herself
of
her
one
idea
of
a
damaging
and
when
are
we
to
hear
of
your
engagement
my
dear
now
said
elaine
quietly
but
with
electrical
effect
i
came
to
announce
it
to
you
but
i
wanted
to
hear
all
about
suzette
first
it
will
be
formally
announced
in
the
papers
in
a
day
or
but
who
is
it
is
it
the
young
man
who
was
with
you
in
the
park
this
morning
asked
suzette
let
me
see
who
was
i
with
in
the
park
this
morning
a
very
dark
boy
oh
no
not
comus
bassington
someone
you
know
by
name
anyway
and
i
expect
you
ve
seen
his
portrait
in
the
a
asked
brankley
courtenay
youghal
said
elaine
brankley
and
suzette
had
often
rehearsed
in
the
privacy
of
their
minds
the
occasion
when
elaine
should
come
to
pay
her
personal
congratulations
to
her
engaged
cousin
it
had
never
been
in
the
least
like
this
on
her
return
from
her
enjoyable
afternoon
visit
elaine
found
an
express
messenger
letter
waiting
for
her
it
was
from
comus
thanking
her
for
her
returning
it
i
suppose
i
ought
never
to
have
asked
you
for
it
he
wrote
but
you
are
always
so
deliciously
solemn
about
money
matters
that
i
couldn
t
resist
just
heard
the
news
of
your
engagement
to
courtenay
congrats
to
you
both
i
m
far
too
stoney
broke
to
buy
you
a
wedding
present
so
i
m
going
to
give
you
back
the
dish
luckily
it
still
has
your
crest
on
it
i
shall
love
to
think
of
you
and
courtenay
eating
out
of
it
for
the
rest
of
your
that
was
all
he
had
to
say
on
the
matter
about
which
elaine
had
been
preparing
to
write
a
long
and
letter
closing
a
rather
momentous
chapter
in
her
life
and
his
there
was
not
a
trace
of
regret
or
upbraiding
in
his
note
he
had
walked
out
of
their
mutual
fairyland
as
abruptly
as
she
had
and
to
all
appearances
far
more
unconcernedly
reading
the
letter
again
and
again
elaine
could
come
to
no
decision
as
to
whether
this
was
merely
a
courageous
gibe
at
defeat
or
whether
it
represented
the
real
value
that
comus
set
on
the
thing
that
he
had
lost
and
she
would
never
know
if
comus
possessed
one
useless
gift
to
perfection
it
was
the
gift
of
laughing
at
fate
even
when
it
had
struck
him
hardest
one
day
perhaps
the
laughter
and
mockery
would
be
silent
on
his
lips
and
fate
would
have
the
advantage
of
laughing
last
chapter
xii
a
door
closed
and
francesca
bassington
sat
alone
in
her
the
visitor
who
had
been
enjoying
the
hospitality
of
her
table
had
just
taken
his
departure
the
had
not
been
a
pleasant
one
at
any
rate
as
far
as
francesca
was
concerned
but
at
least
it
had
brought
her
the
information
for
which
she
had
been
seeking
her
rôle
of
from
a
tactful
distance
had
necessarily
left
her
much
in
the
dark
concerning
the
progress
of
the
wooing
but
during
the
last
few
hours
she
had
on
slender
though
significant
evidence
exchanged
her
complacent
expectancy
for
a
conviction
that
something
had
gone
wrong
she
had
spent
the
previous
evening
at
her
brother
s
house
and
had
naturally
seen
nothing
of
comus
in
that
uncongenial
quarter
neither
had
he
put
in
an
appearance
at
the
breakfast
table
the
following
morning
she
had
met
him
in
the
hall
at
eleven
o
clock
and
he
had
hurried
past
her
merely
imparting
the
information
that
he
would
not
be
in
till
dinner
that
evening
he
spoke
in
his
sulkiest
tone
and
his
face
wore
a
look
of
defeat
thinly
masked
by
an
air
of
defiance
it
was
not
the
defiance
of
a
man
who
is
losing
but
of
one
who
has
already
lost
francesca
s
conviction
that
things
had
gone
wrong
between
comus
and
elaine
de
frey
grew
in
strength
as
the
day
wore
on
she
lunched
at
a
friend
s
house
but
it
was
not
a
quarter
where
special
social
information
of
any
importance
was
likely
to
come
early
to
hand
instead
of
the
news
she
was
hankering
for
she
had
to
listen
to
trivial
gossip
and
speculation
on
the
flirtations
and
cases
and
affairs
of
a
string
of
acquaintances
whose
matrimonial
projects
interested
her
about
as
much
as
the
nesting
arrangements
of
the
wildfowl
in
james
s
park
of
course
said
her
hostess
with
the
duly
impressive
emphasis
of
a
privileged
chronicler
we
ve
always
regarded
claire
as
the
marrying
one
of
the
family
so
when
emily
came
to
us
and
said
i
ve
got
some
news
for
you
we
all
said
claire
s
engaged
oh
no
said
emily
it
s
not
claire
this
time
it
s
so
then
we
had
to
guess
who
the
lucky
man
was
it
can
t
be
captain
parminter
we
all
said
because
he
s
always
been
sweet
on
and
then
emily
the
recording
voice
reeled
off
the
catalogue
of
inane
remarks
with
a
comfortable
purring
complacency
that
held
out
no
hope
of
an
early
abandoning
of
the
topic
francesca
sat
and
wondered
why
the
innocent
acceptance
of
a
cutlet
and
a
glass
of
indifferent
claret
should
lay
one
open
to
such
unsparing
punishment
a
stroll
homeward
through
the
park
after
lunch
brought
no
further
enlightenment
on
the
subject
that
was
uppermost
in
her
mind
what
was
worse
it
brought
her
without
possibility
of
escape
within
hailing
distance
of
merla
blathington
who
fastened
on
to
her
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
lonely
tsetse
fly
encountering
an
outpost
of
civilisation
just
think
she
buzzed
inconsequently
my
sister
in
cambridgeshire
has
hatched
out
white
orpington
chickens
in
her
incubator
what
eggs
did
she
put
in
it
asked
francesca
oh
some
very
special
strain
of
white
then
i
don
t
see
anything
remarkable
in
the
result
if
she
had
put
in
crocodile
s
eggs
and
hatched
out
white
orpingtons
there
might
have
been
something
to
write
to
what
funny
fascinating
things
these
little
green
are
said
merla
starting
off
on
a
fresh
topic
they
always
look
so
quaint
and
knowing
when
they
re
stuck
away
in
pairs
by
themselves
under
the
trees
as
if
they
were
having
a
talk
or
discussing
a
piece
of
very
private
scandal
if
they
could
only
speak
what
tragedies
and
comedies
they
could
tell
us
of
what
flirtations
and
let
us
be
devoutly
thankful
that
they
can
t
said
francesca
with
a
shuddering
recollection
of
the
conversation
of
course
it
would
make
one
very
careful
what
one
said
before
above
them
rather
merla
rattled
on
and
then
to
francesca
s
infinite
relief
she
espied
another
acquaintance
sitting
in
unprotected
solitude
who
promised
to
supply
a
more
durable
audience
than
her
present
rapidly
moving
companion
francesca
was
free
to
return
to
her
in
blue
street
to
await
with
such
patience
as
she
could
command
the
coming
of
some
visitor
who
might
be
able
to
throw
light
on
the
subject
that
was
puzzling
and
disquieting
her
the
arrival
of
george
michael
boded
bad
news
but
at
any
rate
news
and
she
gave
him
an
almost
cordial
welcome
well
you
see
i
wasn
t
far
wrong
about
miss
de
frey
and
courtenay
youghal
was
i
he
chirruped
almost
before
he
had
seated
himself
francesca
was
to
be
spared
any
further
of
her
period
of
uncertainty
yes
it
s
officially
given
out
he
went
on
and
it
s
to
appear
in
the
i
heard
it
from
colonel
deel
this
morning
and
he
had
it
direct
from
youghal
himself
yes
please
one
lump
i
m
not
fashionable
you
he
had
made
the
same
remark
about
the
sugar
in
his
tea
with
unfailing
regularity
for
at
least
thirty
years
fashions
in
sugar
are
apparently
stationary
they
say
he
continued
hurriedly
that
he
proposed
to
her
on
the
terrace
of
the
house
and
a
division
bell
rang
and
he
had
to
hurry
off
before
she
had
time
to
give
her
answer
and
when
he
got
back
she
simply
said
the
ayes
have
michael
paused
in
his
narrative
to
give
an
appreciative
giggle
just
the
sort
of
inanity
that
would
go
the
rounds
remarked
francesca
with
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
was
making
the
criticism
direct
to
the
author
and
begetter
of
the
inanity
in
question
now
that
the
blow
had
fallen
and
she
knew
the
full
extent
of
its
weight
her
feeling
towards
the
bringer
of
bad
news
who
sat
complacently
nibbling
at
her
and
scattering
crumbs
of
tiresome
at
her
feet
was
one
of
wholehearted
dislike
she
could
sympathise
with
or
at
any
rate
understand
the
tendency
of
oriental
despots
to
inflict
death
or
ignominious
chastisement
on
messengers
bearing
tidings
of
misfortune
and
defeat
and
michael
she
perfectly
well
knew
was
thoroughly
aware
of
the
fact
that
her
hopes
and
wishes
had
been
centred
on
the
possibility
of
having
elaine
for
a
every
purring
remark
that
his
mean
little
soul
prompted
him
to
contribute
to
the
conversation
had
an
easily
recognizable
undercurrent
of
malice
fortunately
for
her
powers
of
polite
endurance
which
had
been
put
to
such
searching
and
repeated
tests
that
day
michael
had
planned
out
for
himself
a
busy
little
of
afternoon
visits
at
each
of
which
his
task
of
forestalling
and
embellishing
the
newspaper
announcements
of
the
frey
engagement
would
be
hurriedly
but
thoroughly
performed
they
ll
be
quite
one
of
the
and
most
interesting
couples
of
the
season
won
t
they
he
cried
by
way
of
farewell
the
door
closed
and
francesca
bassington
sat
alone
in
her
before
she
could
give
way
to
the
bitter
luxury
of
reflection
on
the
downfall
of
her
hopes
it
was
prudent
to
take
precautionary
measures
against
unwelcome
intrusion
summoning
the
maid
who
had
just
speeded
the
departing
michael
she
gave
the
order
i
am
not
at
home
this
afternoon
to
lady
caroline
on
second
thoughts
she
extended
the
taboo
to
all
possible
callers
and
sent
a
telephone
message
to
catch
comus
at
his
club
asking
him
to
come
and
see
her
as
soon
as
he
could
manage
before
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
then
she
sat
down
to
think
and
her
thinking
was
beyond
the
relief
of
tears
she
had
built
herself
a
castle
of
hopes
and
it
had
not
been
a
castle
in
spain
but
a
structure
well
on
the
probable
side
of
the
pyrenees
there
had
been
a
solid
foundation
on
which
to
build
miss
de
frey
s
fortune
was
an
assured
and
unhampered
one
her
liking
for
comus
had
been
an
obvious
fact
his
courtship
of
her
a
serious
reality
the
young
people
had
been
much
together
in
public
and
their
names
had
naturally
been
coupled
in
the
gossip
of
the
day
the
only
serious
shadow
cast
over
the
scene
had
been
the
persistent
presence
in
foreground
or
background
of
courtenay
youghal
and
now
the
shadow
suddenly
stood
forth
as
the
reality
and
the
castle
of
hopes
was
a
ruin
a
hideous
mortification
of
dust
and
débris
with
the
skeleton
outlines
of
its
chambers
still
standing
to
make
mockery
of
its
discomfited
architect
the
daily
anxiety
about
comus
and
his
extravagant
ways
and
intractable
disposition
had
been
gradually
lulled
by
the
prospect
of
his
making
an
advantageous
marriage
which
would
have
transformed
him
from
a
ne
and
adventurer
into
a
wealthy
idler
he
might
even
have
been
moulded
by
the
resourceful
influence
of
an
ambitious
wife
into
a
man
with
some
definite
purpose
in
life
the
prospect
had
vanished
with
cruel
suddenness
and
the
anxieties
were
crowding
back
again
more
insistent
than
ever
the
boy
had
had
his
one
good
chance
in
the
matrimonial
market
and
missed
it
if
he
were
to
transfer
his
attentions
to
some
other
girl
he
would
be
marked
down
at
once
as
a
and
that
would
constitute
a
heavy
handicap
to
the
most
plausible
of
wooers
his
liking
for
elaine
had
evidently
been
genuine
in
its
way
though
perhaps
it
would
have
been
rash
to
read
any
deeper
sentiment
into
it
but
even
with
the
spur
of
his
own
inclination
to
assist
him
he
had
failed
to
win
the
prize
that
had
seemed
so
temptingly
within
his
reach
and
in
the
dashing
of
his
prospects
francesca
saw
the
threatening
of
her
own
the
old
anxiety
as
to
her
precarious
tenure
of
her
present
quarters
put
on
again
all
its
familiar
terrors
one
day
she
foresaw
in
the
horribly
near
future
george
michael
would
come
pattering
up
her
stairs
with
the
breathless
intelligence
that
emmeline
chetrof
was
going
to
marry
somebody
or
other
in
the
guards
or
the
record
office
as
the
case
might
be
and
then
there
would
be
an
uprooting
of
her
life
from
its
home
and
haven
in
blue
street
and
a
wandering
forth
to
some
cheap
unhappy
dwelling
where
the
stately
van
der
meulen
and
its
companion
host
of
beautiful
and
desirable
things
would
be
stuffed
and
stowed
away
in
soulless
surroundings
like
courtly
émigrés
fallen
on
evil
days
it
was
unthinkable
but
the
trouble
was
that
it
had
to
be
thought
about
and
if
comus
had
played
his
cards
well
and
transformed
himself
from
an
encumbrance
into
a
son
with
wealth
at
his
command
the
tragedy
which
she
saw
looming
in
front
of
her
might
have
been
avoided
or
at
the
worst
whittled
down
to
easily
bearable
proportions
with
money
behind
one
the
problem
of
where
to
live
approaches
more
nearly
to
the
simple
question
of
where
do
you
wish
to
live
and
a
rich
would
have
surely
seen
to
it
that
she
did
not
have
to
leave
her
square
mile
of
mecca
and
go
out
into
the
wilderness
of
bricks
and
mortar
if
the
house
in
blue
street
could
not
have
been
compounded
for
there
were
other
desirable
residences
which
would
have
been
capable
of
consoling
francesca
for
her
lost
eden
and
now
the
detested
courtenay
youghal
with
his
mocking
eyes
and
air
of
youthful
cynicism
had
stepped
in
and
overthrown
those
golden
hopes
and
plans
whose
would
make
such
a
world
of
change
in
her
future
assuredly
she
had
reason
to
feel
bitter
against
that
young
man
and
she
was
not
disposed
to
take
a
very
lenient
view
of
comus
s
own
mismanagement
of
the
affair
her
greeting
when
he
at
last
arrived
was
not
couched
in
a
sympathetic
strain
so
you
have
lost
your
chance
with
the
heiress
she
remarked
abruptly
yes
said
comus
coolly
courtenay
youghal
has
added
her
to
his
other
and
you
have
added
her
to
your
other
failures
pursued
francesca
relentlessly
her
temper
had
been
tried
that
day
beyond
ordinary
limits
i
thought
you
seemed
getting
along
so
well
with
her
she
continued
as
comus
remained
uncommunicative
we
hit
it
off
rather
well
together
said
comus
and
added
with
deliberate
bluntness
i
suppose
she
got
rather
sick
at
my
borrowing
money
from
her
she
thought
it
was
all
i
was
you
borrowed
money
from
her
said
francesca
you
were
fool
enough
to
borrow
money
from
a
girl
who
was
favourably
disposed
towards
you
and
with
courtenay
youghal
in
the
background
waiting
to
step
in
and
oust
you
francesca
s
voice
trembled
with
misery
and
rage
this
great
stroke
of
good
luck
that
had
seemed
about
to
fall
into
their
laps
had
been
thrust
aside
by
an
act
or
series
of
acts
of
wanton
paltry
folly
the
good
ship
had
been
lost
for
the
sake
of
the
traditional
ha
porth
of
tar
comus
had
paid
some
pressing
tailor
s
or
tobacconist
s
bill
with
a
loan
unwillingly
put
at
his
disposal
by
the
girl
he
was
courting
and
had
flung
away
his
chances
of
securing
a
wealthy
and
in
every
way
desirable
bride
elaine
de
frey
and
her
fortune
might
have
been
the
making
of
comus
but
he
had
hurried
in
as
usual
to
effect
his
own
undoing
calmness
did
not
in
this
case
come
with
reflection
the
more
francesca
thought
about
the
matter
the
more
exasperated
she
grew
comus
threw
himself
down
in
a
low
chair
and
watched
her
without
a
trace
of
embarrassment
or
concern
at
her
mortification
he
had
come
to
her
feeling
rather
sorry
for
himself
and
bitterly
conscious
of
his
defeat
and
she
had
met
him
with
a
taunt
and
without
the
least
hint
of
sympathy
he
determined
that
she
should
be
tantalised
with
the
knowledge
of
how
small
and
stupid
a
thing
had
stood
between
the
realisation
and
ruin
of
her
hopes
for
him
and
to
think
she
should
be
captured
by
courtenay
youghal
said
francesca
bitterly
i
ve
always
deplored
your
intimacy
with
that
young
it
s
hardly
my
intimacy
with
him
that
s
made
elaine
accept
him
said
comus
francesca
realised
the
futility
of
further
upbraiding
through
the
tears
of
vexation
that
stood
in
her
eyes
she
looked
across
at
the
handsome
boy
who
sat
opposite
her
mocking
at
his
own
misfortune
perversely
indifferent
to
his
folly
seemingly
almost
indifferent
to
its
consequences
comus
she
said
quietly
and
wearily
you
are
an
exact
reversal
of
the
legend
of
pandora
s
box
you
have
all
the
charm
and
advantages
that
a
boy
could
want
to
help
him
on
in
the
world
and
behind
it
all
there
is
the
fatal
damning
gift
of
utter
i
think
said
comus
that
is
the
best
description
that
anyone
has
ever
given
of
for
the
moment
there
was
a
flush
of
sympathy
and
something
like
outspoken
affection
between
mother
and
son
they
seemed
very
much
alone
in
the
world
just
now
and
in
the
general
overturn
of
hopes
and
plans
there
flickered
a
chance
that
each
might
stretch
out
a
hand
to
the
other
and
summon
back
to
their
lives
an
old
dead
love
that
was
the
best
and
strongest
feeling
either
of
them
had
known
but
the
sting
of
disappointment
was
too
keen
and
the
flood
of
resentment
mounted
too
high
on
either
side
to
allow
the
chance
more
than
a
moment
in
which
to
flicker
away
into
nothingness
the
old
fatal
topic
of
estrangement
came
to
the
fore
the
question
of
immediate
ways
and
means
and
mother
and
son
faced
themselves
again
as
antagonists
on
a
field
what
is
done
is
done
said
francesca
with
a
movement
of
tragic
impatience
that
belied
the
philosophy
of
her
words
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
crying
over
spilt
milk
there
is
the
present
and
the
future
to
be
thought
about
though
one
can
t
go
on
indefinitely
as
a
in
a
fools
then
she
pulled
herself
together
and
proceeded
to
deliver
an
ultimatum
which
the
force
of
circumstances
no
longer
permitted
her
to
hold
in
reserve
it
s
not
much
use
talking
to
you
about
money
as
i
know
from
long
experience
but
i
can
only
tell
you
this
that
in
the
middle
of
the
season
i
m
already
obliged
to
be
thinking
of
leaving
town
and
you
i
m
afraid
will
have
to
be
thinking
of
leaving
england
at
equally
short
notice
henry
told
me
the
other
day
that
he
can
get
you
something
out
in
west
africa
you
ve
had
your
chance
of
doing
something
better
for
yourself
from
the
financial
point
of
view
and
you
ve
thrown
it
away
for
the
sake
of
borrowing
a
little
ready
money
for
your
luxuries
so
now
you
must
take
what
you
can
get
the
pay
won
t
be
very
good
at
first
but
living
is
not
dear
out
west
africa
said
comus
reflectively
it
s
a
sort
of
modern
substitute
for
the
a
convenient
depository
for
tiresome
people
dear
uncle
henry
may
talk
lugubriously
about
the
burden
of
empire
but
he
evidently
recognises
its
uses
as
a
refuse
my
dear
comus
you
are
talking
of
the
west
africa
of
yesterday
while
you
have
been
wasting
your
time
at
school
and
worse
than
wasting
your
time
in
the
west
end
other
people
have
been
grappling
with
the
study
of
tropical
diseases
and
the
west
african
coast
country
is
being
rapidly
transformed
from
a
lethal
chamber
into
a
comus
laughed
mockingly
what
a
beautiful
bit
of
persuasive
prose
it
reminds
one
of
the
psalms
and
even
more
of
a
company
prospectus
if
you
were
honest
you
d
confess
that
you
lifted
it
straight
out
of
a
rubber
or
railway
promotion
scheme
seriously
mother
if
i
must
grub
about
for
a
living
why
can
t
i
do
it
in
england
i
could
go
into
a
brewery
for
francesca
shook
her
head
decisively
she
could
foresee
the
sort
of
steady
work
comus
was
likely
to
accomplish
with
the
lodestone
of
town
and
the
minor
attractions
of
and
similar
festivities
always
beckoning
to
him
from
a
conveniently
attainable
distance
but
apart
from
that
aspect
of
the
case
there
was
a
financial
obstacle
in
the
way
of
his
obtaining
any
employment
at
home
breweries
and
all
those
sort
of
things
necessitate
money
to
start
with
one
has
to
pay
premiums
or
invest
capital
in
the
undertaking
and
so
forth
and
as
we
have
no
money
available
and
can
scarcely
pay
our
debts
as
it
is
it
s
no
use
thinking
about
can
t
we
sell
something
asked
comus
he
made
no
actual
suggestion
as
to
what
should
be
sacrificed
but
he
was
looking
straight
at
the
van
der
meulen
for
a
moment
francesca
felt
a
stifling
sensation
of
weakness
as
though
her
heart
was
going
to
stop
beating
then
she
sat
forward
in
her
chair
and
spoke
with
energy
almost
fierceness
when
i
am
dead
my
things
can
be
sold
and
dispersed
as
long
as
i
am
alive
i
prefer
to
keep
them
by
in
her
holy
place
with
all
her
treasured
possessions
around
her
this
dreadful
suggestion
had
been
made
some
of
her
cherished
household
gods
souvenirs
and
keepsakes
from
past
days
would
perhaps
not
have
fetched
a
very
considerable
sum
in
the
others
had
a
distinct
value
of
their
own
but
to
her
they
were
all
precious
and
the
van
der
meulen
at
which
comus
had
looked
with
impious
appraising
eyes
was
the
most
sacred
of
them
all
when
francesca
had
been
away
from
her
town
residence
or
had
been
confined
to
her
bedroom
through
illness
the
great
picture
with
its
stately
solemn
representation
of
a
painted
to
flatter
the
soul
of
a
who
was
dignified
even
in
his
was
the
first
thing
she
visited
on
her
return
to
town
or
convalescence
if
an
alarm
of
fire
had
been
raised
it
would
have
been
the
first
thing
for
whose
safety
she
would
have
troubled
and
comus
had
almost
suggested
that
it
should
be
parted
with
as
one
sold
railway
shares
and
other
soulless
things
scolding
she
had
long
ago
realised
was
a
useless
waste
of
time
and
energy
where
comus
was
concerned
but
this
evening
she
unloosed
her
tongue
for
the
mere
relief
that
it
gave
to
her
surcharged
feelings
he
sat
listening
without
comment
though
she
purposely
let
fall
remarks
that
she
hoped
might
sting
him
into
or
protest
it
was
an
unsparing
indictment
the
more
damaging
in
that
it
was
so
irrefutably
true
the
more
tragic
in
that
it
came
from
perhaps
the
one
person
in
the
world
whose
opinion
he
had
ever
cared
for
and
he
sat
through
it
as
silent
and
seemingly
unmoved
as
though
she
had
been
rehearsing
a
speech
for
some
comedy
when
she
had
had
her
say
his
method
of
retort
was
not
the
soft
answer
that
turneth
away
wrath
but
the
inconsequent
one
that
shelves
it
let
s
go
and
dress
for
the
meal
like
so
many
that
francesca
and
comus
had
eaten
in
each
other
s
company
of
late
was
a
silent
one
now
that
the
full
bearings
of
the
disaster
had
been
discussed
in
all
its
aspects
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
any
attempt
at
ignoring
the
situation
and
passing
on
to
less
controversial
topics
would
have
been
a
mockery
and
pretence
which
neither
of
them
would
have
troubled
to
sustain
so
the
meal
went
forward
with
its
dreary
intimacy
of
two
people
who
were
separated
by
a
gulf
of
bitterness
and
whose
hearts
were
hard
with
resentment
against
one
another
francesca
felt
a
sense
of
relief
when
she
was
able
to
give
the
maid
the
order
to
serve
her
coffee
upstairs
comus
had
a
sullen
scowl
on
his
face
but
he
looked
up
as
she
rose
to
leave
the
room
and
gave
his
little
laugh
you
needn
t
look
so
tragic
he
said
you
re
going
to
have
your
own
way
i
ll
go
out
to
that
west
african
chapter
xiii
comus
found
his
way
to
his
seat
in
the
stalls
of
the
straw
exchange
theatre
and
turned
to
watch
the
stream
of
distinguished
and
distinguishable
people
who
made
their
appearance
as
a
matter
of
course
at
a
first
night
in
the
height
of
the
season
pit
and
gallery
were
already
packed
with
a
throng
tense
expectant
and
alert
that
waited
for
the
rise
of
the
curtain
with
the
eager
patience
of
a
terrier
watching
a
dilatory
human
prepare
for
outdoor
exercises
stalls
and
boxes
filled
slowly
and
hesitatingly
with
a
crowd
whose
component
units
seemed
for
the
most
part
to
recognise
the
probability
that
they
were
quite
as
interesting
as
any
play
they
were
likely
to
see
those
who
bore
no
particular
themselves
derived
a
certain
amount
of
social
dignity
from
the
near
neighbourhood
of
obvious
notabilities
if
one
could
not
obtain
recognition
oneself
there
was
some
vague
pleasure
in
being
able
to
recognise
notoriety
at
intimately
close
quarters
who
is
that
woman
with
the
auburn
hair
and
a
rather
effective
belligerent
gleam
in
her
eyes
asked
a
man
sitting
just
behind
comus
she
looks
as
if
she
might
have
created
the
world
in
six
days
and
destroyed
it
on
the
i
forget
her
name
said
his
neighbour
she
writes
she
s
the
author
of
that
book
the
woman
who
wished
it
was
wednesday
you
know
it
used
to
be
the
convention
that
women
writers
should
be
plain
and
dowdy
now
we
have
gone
to
the
other
extreme
and
build
them
on
extravagantly
decorative
a
buzz
of
recognition
came
from
the
front
rows
of
the
pit
together
with
a
craning
of
necks
on
the
part
of
those
in
less
favoured
seats
it
heralded
the
arrival
of
sherard
blaw
the
dramatist
who
had
discovered
himself
and
who
had
given
so
ungrudgingly
of
his
discovery
to
the
world
lady
caroline
who
was
already
directing
little
conversational
onslaughts
from
her
box
gazed
gently
for
a
moment
at
the
new
arrival
and
then
turned
to
the
archdeacon
sitting
beside
her
they
say
the
poor
man
is
haunted
by
the
fear
that
he
will
die
during
a
general
election
and
that
his
obituary
notices
will
be
seriously
curtailed
by
the
space
taken
up
by
the
election
results
the
curse
of
our
party
system
from
his
point
of
view
is
that
it
takes
up
so
much
room
in
the
the
archdeacon
smiled
indulgently
as
a
man
he
was
so
exquisitely
worldly
that
he
fully
merited
the
name
of
the
heavenly
worldling
bestowed
on
him
by
an
admiring
duchess
and
withal
his
texture
was
shot
with
a
pattern
of
such
genuine
saintliness
that
one
felt
that
whoever
else
might
hold
the
keys
of
paradise
he
at
least
possessed
a
private
latchkey
to
that
abode
is
it
not
significant
of
the
altered
grouping
of
things
he
observed
that
the
church
as
represented
by
me
sympathises
with
the
message
of
sherard
blaw
while
neither
the
man
nor
his
message
find
acceptance
with
unbelievers
like
you
lady
lady
caroline
blinked
her
eyes
my
dear
archdeacon
she
said
no
one
can
be
an
unbeliever
nowadays
the
christian
apologists
have
left
one
nothing
to
the
archdeacon
rose
with
a
delighted
chuckle
i
must
go
and
tell
that
to
de
la
poulett
he
said
indicating
a
clerical
figure
sitting
in
the
third
row
of
the
stalls
he
spends
his
life
explaining
from
his
pulpit
that
the
glory
of
christianity
consists
in
the
fact
that
though
it
is
not
true
it
has
been
found
necessary
to
invent
the
door
of
the
box
opened
and
courtenay
youghal
entered
bringing
with
him
subtle
suggestion
of
chaminade
and
an
atmosphere
of
political
tension
the
government
had
fallen
out
of
the
good
graces
of
a
section
of
its
supporters
and
those
who
were
not
in
the
know
were
busy
predicting
a
serious
crisis
over
a
forthcoming
division
in
the
committee
stage
of
an
important
bill
this
was
saturday
night
and
unless
some
successful
cajolery
were
effected
between
now
and
monday
afternoon
ministers
would
be
seemingly
in
danger
of
defeat
ah
here
is
youghal
said
the
archdeacon
he
will
be
able
to
tell
us
what
is
going
to
happen
in
the
next
hours
i
hear
the
prime
minister
says
it
is
a
matter
of
conscience
and
they
will
stand
or
fall
by
his
hopes
and
sympathies
were
notoriously
on
the
ministerial
side
youghal
greeted
lady
caroline
and
subsided
gracefully
into
a
chair
well
in
the
front
of
the
box
a
buzz
of
recognition
rippled
slowly
across
the
house
for
the
government
to
fall
on
a
matter
of
conscience
he
said
would
be
like
a
man
cutting
himself
with
a
safety
lady
caroline
purred
a
gentle
approval
i
m
afraid
it
s
true
archdeacon
she
said
no
one
can
effectively
defend
a
government
when
it
s
been
in
office
several
years
the
archdeacon
took
refuge
in
light
skirmishing
i
believe
lady
caroline
sees
the
makings
of
a
great
socialist
statesman
in
you
youghal
he
observed
great
socialist
statesmen
aren
t
made
they
re
stillborn
replied
youghal
what
is
the
play
about
asked
a
pale
young
woman
who
had
taken
no
part
in
the
talk
i
don
t
know
said
lady
caroline
but
i
hope
it
s
dull
if
there
is
any
brilliant
conversation
in
it
i
shall
burst
into
in
the
front
row
of
the
upper
circle
a
woman
with
a
restless
was
discussing
the
work
of
a
temporarily
fashionable
composer
chiefly
in
relation
to
her
own
emotions
which
she
seemed
to
think
might
prove
generally
interesting
to
those
around
her
whenever
i
hear
his
music
i
feel
that
i
want
to
go
up
into
a
mountain
and
pray
can
you
understand
that
feeling
the
girl
to
whom
she
was
unburdening
herself
shook
her
head
you
see
i
ve
heard
his
music
chiefly
in
switzerland
and
we
were
up
among
the
mountains
all
the
time
so
it
wouldn
t
have
made
any
in
that
case
said
the
woman
who
seemed
to
have
emergency
emotions
to
suit
all
geographical
conditions
i
should
have
wanted
to
be
in
a
great
silent
plain
by
the
side
of
a
rushing
what
i
think
is
so
splendid
about
his
commenced
another
on
the
further
side
of
the
girl
like
sheep
that
feed
greedily
before
the
coming
of
a
storm
the
seemed
impelled
to
extra
effort
by
the
knowledge
of
four
imminent
intervals
of
acting
during
which
they
would
be
hushed
into
constrained
silence
in
the
back
row
of
the
dress
circle
a
after
a
cursory
glance
at
the
programme
had
settled
down
into
a
comfortable
narrative
which
was
evidently
the
resumed
thread
of
an
unfinished
monologue
we
all
said
it
can
t
be
captain
parminter
because
he
s
always
been
sweet
on
joan
and
then
emily
the
curtain
went
up
and
emily
s
contribution
to
the
discussion
had
to
be
held
over
till
the
entr
acte
the
play
promised
to
be
a
success
the
author
avoiding
the
pitfall
of
brilliancy
had
aimed
at
being
interesting
and
as
far
as
possible
bearing
in
mind
that
his
play
was
a
comedy
he
had
striven
to
be
amusing
above
all
he
had
remembered
that
in
the
laws
of
stage
proportions
it
is
permissible
and
generally
desirable
that
the
part
should
be
greater
than
the
whole
hence
he
had
been
careful
to
give
the
leading
lady
such
a
clear
and
commanding
lead
over
the
other
characters
of
the
play
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
of
them
ever
to
get
on
level
terms
with
her
the
action
of
the
piece
was
now
and
then
delayed
thereby
but
the
duration
of
its
run
would
be
materially
prolonged
the
curtain
came
down
on
the
first
act
amid
an
encouraging
instalment
of
applause
and
the
audience
turned
its
back
on
the
stage
and
began
to
take
a
renewed
interest
in
itself
the
authoress
of
the
woman
who
wished
it
was
wednesday
had
swept
like
a
convalescent
whirlwind
subdued
but
potentially
tempestuous
into
lady
caroline
s
box
i
ve
just
trodden
with
all
my
weight
on
the
foot
of
an
eminent
publisher
as
i
was
leaving
my
seat
she
cried
with
a
peal
of
delighted
laughter
he
was
such
a
dear
about
it
i
said
i
hoped
i
hadn
t
hurt
him
and
he
said
i
suppose
you
think
who
drives
hard
bargains
should
himself
be
wasn
t
it
of
him
i
ve
never
trodden
on
a
pet
lamb
said
lady
caroline
so
i
ve
no
idea
what
its
behaviour
would
be
under
the
tell
me
said
the
authoress
coming
to
the
front
of
the
box
the
better
to
survey
the
house
and
perhaps
also
with
a
charitable
desire
to
make
things
easy
for
those
who
might
pardonably
wish
to
survey
her
tell
me
please
where
is
the
girl
sitting
whom
courtenay
youghal
is
engaged
to
elaine
was
pointed
out
to
her
sitting
in
the
fourth
row
of
the
stalls
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
to
where
comus
had
his
seat
once
during
the
interval
she
had
turned
to
give
him
a
friendly
nod
of
recognition
as
he
stood
in
one
of
the
side
gangways
but
he
was
absorbed
at
the
moment
in
looking
at
himself
in
the
glass
panel
the
grave
brown
eyes
and
the
mocking
ones
had
looked
their
last
into
each
other
s
depths
for
comus
this
performance
with
its
brilliant
gathering
of
spectators
its
groups
and
coteries
of
lively
talkers
even
its
counterfoil
of
dull
chatterers
its
pervading
atmosphere
of
stage
and
social
movement
and
its
intruding
undercurrent
of
political
flutter
all
this
composed
a
tragedy
in
which
he
was
the
chief
character
it
was
the
life
he
knew
and
loved
and
basked
in
and
it
was
the
life
he
was
leaving
it
would
go
on
reproducing
itself
again
and
again
with
its
stage
interest
and
social
interest
and
intruding
outside
interests
with
the
same
lively
chattering
crowd
the
people
who
had
done
things
being
pointed
out
by
people
who
recognised
them
to
people
who
didn
would
all
go
on
with
unflagging
animation
and
sparkle
and
enjoyment
and
for
him
it
would
have
stopped
utterly
he
would
be
in
some
wilderness
where
natives
and
pariah
dogs
and
crows
fringed
round
mockingly
on
one
s
loneliness
where
one
rode
for
sweltering
miles
for
the
chance
of
meeting
a
collector
or
police
officer
with
whom
most
likely
on
closer
acquaintance
one
had
hardly
two
ideas
in
common
where
female
society
was
represented
at
long
intervals
by
some
woman
missionary
or
official
s
wife
where
food
and
sickness
and
veterinary
lore
became
at
last
the
three
outstanding
subjects
on
which
the
mind
settled
or
rather
sank
that
was
the
life
he
foresaw
and
dreaded
and
that
was
the
life
he
was
going
to
for
a
boy
who
went
out
to
it
from
the
dulness
of
some
country
rectory
from
a
neighbourhood
where
a
flower
show
and
a
cricket
match
formed
the
social
landmarks
of
the
year
the
feeling
of
exile
might
not
be
very
crushing
might
indeed
be
lost
in
the
sense
of
change
and
adventure
but
comus
had
lived
too
thoroughly
in
the
centre
of
things
to
regard
life
in
a
backwater
as
anything
else
than
stagnation
and
stagnation
while
one
is
young
he
justly
regarded
as
an
offence
against
nature
and
reason
in
keeping
with
the
perverted
mockery
that
sends
decrepit
invalids
touring
painfully
about
the
world
and
shuts
panthers
up
in
narrow
cages
he
was
being
put
aside
as
a
wine
is
put
aside
but
to
deteriorate
instead
of
gaining
in
the
process
to
lose
the
best
time
of
his
youth
and
health
and
good
looks
in
a
world
where
youth
and
health
and
good
looks
count
for
much
and
where
time
never
returns
lost
possessions
and
thus
as
the
curtain
swept
down
on
the
close
of
each
act
comus
felt
a
sense
of
depression
and
deprivation
sweep
down
on
himself
bitterly
he
watched
his
last
evening
of
social
gaiety
slipping
away
to
its
end
in
less
than
an
hour
it
would
be
over
in
a
few
months
time
it
would
be
an
unreal
memory
in
the
third
interval
as
he
gazed
round
at
the
chattering
house
someone
touched
him
on
the
arm
it
was
lady
veula
croot
i
suppose
in
a
week
s
time
you
ll
be
on
the
high
seas
she
said
i
m
coming
to
your
farewell
dinner
you
know
your
mother
has
just
asked
me
i
m
not
going
to
talk
the
usual
rot
to
you
about
how
much
you
will
like
it
and
so
on
i
sometimes
think
that
one
of
the
advantages
of
hell
will
be
that
no
one
will
have
the
impertinence
to
point
out
to
you
that
you
re
really
better
off
than
you
would
be
anywhere
else
what
do
you
think
of
the
play
of
course
one
can
foresee
the
end
she
will
come
to
her
husband
with
the
announcement
that
their
child
is
going
to
be
born
and
that
will
smooth
over
everything
so
conveniently
effective
to
wind
up
a
comedy
with
the
commencement
of
someone
else
s
tragedy
and
every
one
will
go
away
saying
i
m
glad
it
had
a
happy
lady
veula
moved
back
to
her
seat
with
her
pleasant
smile
on
her
lips
and
the
look
of
infinite
weariness
in
her
eyes
the
interval
the
last
interval
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
the
house
began
to
turn
with
fidgetty
attention
towards
the
stage
for
the
unfolding
of
the
final
phase
of
the
play
francesca
sat
in
serena
golackly
s
box
listening
to
colonel
springfield
s
story
of
what
happened
to
a
in
his
compound
at
poona
everyone
who
knew
the
colonel
had
to
listen
to
that
story
a
good
many
times
but
lady
caroline
had
mitigated
the
boredom
of
the
infliction
and
in
fact
invested
it
with
a
certain
sporting
interest
by
offering
a
prize
to
the
person
who
heard
it
oftenest
in
the
course
of
the
season
the
competitors
being
under
an
honourable
understanding
not
to
lead
up
to
the
subject
ada
spelvexit
and
a
boy
in
the
foreign
office
were
at
present
at
the
top
of
the
list
with
five
recitals
each
to
their
score
but
the
former
was
suspected
of
doubtful
adherence
to
the
rules
and
spirit
of
the
competition
and
there
dear
lady
concluded
the
colonel
were
the
eleven
dead
pigeons
what
had
become
of
the
bandicoot
no
one
ever
francesca
thanked
him
for
his
story
and
complacently
inscribed
the
figure
on
the
margin
of
her
theatre
programme
almost
at
the
same
moment
she
heard
george
michael
s
voice
pattering
out
a
breathless
piece
of
intelligence
for
the
edification
of
serena
golackly
and
anyone
else
who
might
care
to
listen
francesca
galvanised
into
sudden
attention
emmeline
chetrof
to
a
fellow
in
the
indian
forest
department
he
s
got
nothing
but
his
pay
and
they
can
t
be
married
for
four
or
five
years
an
absurdly
long
engagement
don
t
you
think
so
all
very
well
to
wait
seven
years
for
a
wife
in
patriarchal
times
when
you
probably
had
others
to
go
on
with
and
you
lived
long
enough
to
celebrate
your
own
tercentenary
but
under
modern
conditions
it
seems
a
foolish
michael
spoke
almost
with
a
sense
of
grievance
a
marriage
project
that
tied
up
all
the
small
pleasant
nuptial
about
bridesmaids
and
honeymoon
and
recalcitrant
aunts
and
so
forth
for
an
indefinite
number
of
years
seemed
scarcely
decent
in
his
eyes
and
there
was
little
satisfaction
or
importance
to
be
derived
from
early
and
special
knowledge
of
an
event
which
loomed
as
far
distant
as
a
presidential
election
or
a
change
of
viceroy
but
to
francesca
who
had
listened
with
startled
apprehension
at
the
mention
of
emmeline
chetrof
s
name
the
news
came
in
a
flood
of
relief
and
thankfulness
short
of
entering
a
nunnery
and
taking
celibate
vows
emmeline
could
hardly
have
behaved
more
conveniently
than
in
tying
herself
up
to
a
lover
whose
circumstances
made
it
necessary
to
relegate
marriage
to
the
distant
future
for
four
or
five
years
francesca
was
assured
of
undisturbed
possession
of
the
house
in
blue
street
and
after
that
period
who
knew
what
might
happen
the
engagement
might
stretch
on
indefinitely
it
might
even
come
to
nothing
under
the
weight
of
its
accumulated
years
as
sometimes
happened
with
these
protracted
affairs
emmeline
might
lose
her
fancy
for
her
absentee
lover
and
might
never
replace
him
with
another
a
golden
possibility
of
perpetual
tenancy
of
her
present
home
began
to
float
once
more
through
francesca
s
mind
as
long
as
emmeline
had
been
unbespoken
in
the
marriage
market
there
had
always
been
the
haunting
likelihood
of
seeing
the
dreaded
announcement
a
marriage
has
been
arranged
and
will
shortly
take
place
in
connection
with
her
name
and
now
a
marriage
had
been
arranged
and
would
not
shortly
take
place
might
indeed
never
take
place
michael
s
information
was
likely
to
be
correct
in
this
instance
he
would
never
have
invented
a
piece
of
matrimonial
intelligence
which
gave
such
little
scope
for
supplementary
detail
of
the
kind
he
loved
to
supply
as
francesca
turned
to
watch
the
fourth
act
of
the
play
her
mind
was
singing
a
pæan
of
thankfulness
and
exultation
it
was
as
though
some
artificer
sent
by
the
gods
had
reinforced
with
a
substantial
cord
the
horsehair
thread
that
held
up
the
sword
of
damocles
over
her
head
her
love
for
her
home
for
her
treasured
household
possessions
and
her
pleasant
social
life
was
able
to
expand
once
more
in
present
security
and
feed
on
future
hope
she
was
still
young
enough
to
count
four
or
five
years
as
a
long
time
and
she
was
optimistic
enough
to
prophesy
smooth
things
of
the
future
that
lay
beyond
that
span
of
the
fourth
act
with
its
carefully
held
back
but
obviously
imminent
reconciliation
between
the
leading
characters
she
took
in
but
little
except
that
she
vaguely
understood
it
to
have
a
happy
ending
as
the
lights
went
up
she
looked
round
on
the
dispersing
audience
with
a
feeling
of
friendliness
uppermost
in
her
mind
even
the
sight
of
elaine
de
frey
and
courtenay
youghal
leaving
the
theatre
together
did
not
inspire
her
with
a
tenth
part
of
the
annoyance
that
their
entrance
had
caused
her
serena
s
invitation
to
go
on
to
the
savoy
for
supper
fitted
in
exactly
with
her
mood
of
exhilaration
it
would
be
a
fit
and
appropriate
to
an
auspicious
evening
the
cold
chicken
and
modest
brand
of
chablis
waiting
for
her
at
home
should
give
way
to
a
banquet
of
more
festive
nature
in
the
crush
of
the
vestibule
friends
and
enemies
personal
and
political
were
jostled
and
locked
together
in
the
general
effort
to
rejoin
temporarily
estranged
garments
and
secure
the
attendance
of
elusive
vehicles
lady
caroline
found
herself
at
close
quarters
with
the
estimable
henry
greech
and
experienced
some
of
the
joy
which
comes
to
the
homeward
wending
sportsman
when
a
chance
shot
presents
itself
on
which
he
may
expend
his
remaining
cartridges
so
the
government
is
going
to
climb
down
after
all
she
said
with
a
provocative
assumption
of
private
information
on
the
subject
i
assure
you
the
government
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
replied
the
member
of
parliament
with
befitting
dignity
the
prime
minister
told
me
last
night
that
under
no
my
dear
greech
said
lady
caroline
we
all
know
that
prime
ministers
are
wedded
to
the
truth
but
like
other
wedded
couples
they
sometimes
live
for
her
at
any
rate
the
comedy
had
had
a
happy
ending
comus
made
his
way
slowly
and
lingeringly
from
the
stalls
so
slowly
that
the
lights
were
already
being
turned
down
and
great
were
being
swaythed
over
the
ornamental
the
laughing
chattering
yawning
throng
had
filtered
out
of
the
vestibule
and
was
melting
away
in
final
groups
from
the
steps
of
the
theatre
an
impatient
attendant
gave
him
his
coat
and
locked
up
the
cloak
room
comus
stepped
out
under
the
portico
he
looked
at
the
posters
announcing
the
play
and
in
anticipation
he
could
see
other
posters
announcing
its
performance
two
hundred
performances
by
that
time
the
straw
exchange
theatre
would
be
to
him
something
so
remote
and
unreal
that
it
would
hardly
seem
to
exist
or
to
have
ever
existed
except
in
his
fancy
and
to
the
laughing
chattering
throng
that
would
pass
in
under
that
portico
to
the
performance
he
would
be
to
those
that
had
known
him
something
equally
remote
and
the
bassington
boy
oh
dead
or
or
or
something
of
that
chapter
xiv
the
farewell
dinner
which
francesca
had
hurriedly
organised
in
honour
of
her
son
s
departure
threatened
from
the
outset
to
be
a
doubtfully
successful
function
in
the
first
place
as
he
observed
privately
there
was
very
little
of
comus
and
a
good
deal
of
farewell
in
it
his
own
particular
friends
were
unrepresented
courtenay
youghal
was
out
of
the
question
and
though
francesca
would
have
stretched
a
point
and
welcomed
some
of
his
other
male
associates
of
whom
she
scarcely
approved
he
himself
had
been
opposed
to
including
any
of
them
in
the
invitations
on
the
other
hand
as
henry
greech
had
provided
comus
with
this
job
that
he
was
going
out
to
and
was
moreover
finding
part
of
the
money
for
the
necessary
outfit
francesca
had
felt
it
her
duty
to
ask
him
and
his
wife
to
the
dinner
the
obtuseness
that
seems
to
cling
to
some
people
like
a
garment
throughout
their
life
had
caused
greech
to
accept
the
invitation
when
comus
heard
of
the
circumstance
he
laughed
long
and
boisterously
his
spirits
francesca
noted
seemed
to
be
rising
fast
as
the
hour
for
departure
drew
near
the
other
guests
included
serena
golackly
and
lady
veula
the
latter
having
been
asked
on
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
at
the
theatrical
in
the
height
of
the
season
it
was
not
easy
to
get
together
a
goodly
selection
of
guests
at
short
notice
and
francesca
had
gladly
fallen
in
with
serena
s
suggestion
of
bringing
with
her
stephen
thorle
who
was
alleged
in
loose
feminine
phrasing
to
know
all
about
tropical
africa
his
travels
and
experiences
in
those
regions
probably
did
not
cover
much
ground
or
stretch
over
any
great
length
of
time
but
he
was
one
of
those
individuals
who
can
describe
a
continent
on
the
strength
of
a
few
days
stay
in
a
coast
town
as
intimately
and
dogmatically
as
a
paleontologist
will
reconstruct
an
extinct
mammal
from
the
evidence
of
a
stray
shin
bone
he
had
the
loud
penetrating
voice
and
the
prominent
penetrating
eyes
of
a
man
who
can
do
no
listening
in
the
ordinary
way
and
whose
eyes
have
to
perform
the
function
of
listening
for
him
his
vanity
did
not
necessarily
make
him
unbearable
unless
one
had
to
spend
much
time
in
his
society
and
his
need
for
a
wide
field
of
audience
and
admiration
was
mercifully
calculated
to
spread
his
operations
over
a
considerable
human
area
moreover
his
craving
for
attentive
listeners
forced
him
to
interest
himself
in
a
wonderful
variety
of
subjects
on
which
he
was
able
to
discourse
fluently
and
with
a
certain
semblance
of
special
knowledge
politics
he
avoided
the
ground
was
too
well
known
and
there
was
a
definite
no
to
every
definite
yes
that
could
be
put
forward
moreover
argument
was
not
congenial
to
his
disposition
which
preferred
an
unchallenged
flow
of
dissertation
modified
by
occasional
helpful
questions
which
formed
the
starting
point
for
new
offshoots
of
the
promotion
of
cottage
industries
the
prevention
of
juvenile
street
trading
the
extension
of
the
borstal
prison
system
the
furtherance
of
vague
talkative
religious
movements
the
fostering
of
all
found
in
him
a
tireless
exponent
a
fluent
and
entertaining
though
perhaps
not
very
convincing
advocate
with
the
real
motive
power
behind
these
various
causes
he
was
not
very
closely
identified
to
the
who
carried
on
the
actual
labours
of
each
particular
movement
he
bore
the
relation
of
a
delving
superficially
at
the
surface
but
able
to
devote
a
proportionately
far
greater
amount
of
time
to
the
advertisement
of
his
progress
and
achievements
such
was
stephen
thorle
a
governess
in
the
nursery
of
religions
a
skilled
in
the
emporium
of
his
own
personality
and
needless
to
say
evanescently
popular
amid
a
wide
but
shifting
circle
of
acquaintances
he
improved
on
the
record
of
a
socially
individual
whose
experience
has
become
classical
and
went
to
most
of
the
best
his
inclusion
as
a
guest
at
this
particular
was
not
a
very
happy
inspiration
he
was
inclined
to
patronise
comus
as
well
as
the
african
continent
and
on
even
slighter
acquaintance
with
the
exception
of
henry
greech
whose
feelings
towards
his
nephew
had
been
soured
by
many
years
of
overt
antagonism
there
was
an
uncomfortable
feeling
among
those
present
that
the
topic
of
the
export
trade
as
comus
would
have
himself
expressed
it
was
being
given
undue
prominence
in
what
should
have
been
a
festive
farewell
banquet
and
comus
in
whose
honour
the
feast
was
given
did
not
contribute
much
towards
its
success
though
his
spirits
seemed
strung
up
to
a
high
pitch
his
merriment
was
more
the
merriment
of
a
cynical
and
amused
onlooker
than
of
one
who
responds
to
the
gaiety
of
his
companions
sometimes
he
laughed
quietly
to
himself
at
some
chance
remark
of
a
scarcely
nature
and
lady
veula
watching
him
narrowly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
an
element
of
fear
was
blended
with
his
seemingly
buoyant
spirits
once
or
twice
he
caught
her
eye
across
the
table
and
a
certain
sympathy
seemed
to
grow
up
between
them
as
though
they
were
both
consciously
watching
some
lugubrious
comedy
that
was
being
played
out
before
them
an
untoward
little
incident
had
marked
the
commencement
of
the
meal
a
small
picture
that
hung
over
the
sideboard
had
snapped
its
cord
and
slid
down
with
an
alarming
clatter
on
to
the
crowded
board
beneath
it
the
picture
itself
was
scarcely
damaged
but
its
fall
had
been
accompanied
by
a
tinkle
of
broken
glass
and
it
was
found
that
a
liqueur
glass
one
out
of
a
set
of
seven
that
would
be
impossible
to
match
had
been
shivered
into
fragments
francesca
s
almost
motherly
love
for
her
possessions
made
her
peculiarly
sensible
to
a
feeling
of
annoyance
and
depression
at
the
accident
but
she
turned
politely
to
listen
to
greech
s
account
of
a
misfortune
in
which
four
were
involved
henry
was
not
a
brilliant
conversationalist
and
her
flank
was
speedily
turned
by
stephen
thorle
who
recounted
a
slum
experience
in
which
two
entire
families
did
all
their
feeding
out
of
one
damaged
the
gratitude
of
those
poor
creatures
when
i
presented
them
with
a
set
of
table
crockery
apiece
the
tears
in
their
eyes
and
in
their
voices
when
they
thanked
me
would
be
impossible
to
thank
you
all
the
same
for
describing
it
said
comus
the
listening
eyes
went
swiftly
round
the
table
to
gather
evidence
as
to
how
this
rather
disconcerting
remark
had
been
received
but
thorle
s
voice
continued
uninterruptedly
to
retail
stories
of
gratitude
never
failing
to
mention
the
particular
deeds
of
disinterested
charity
on
his
part
which
had
evoked
and
justified
the
gratitude
greech
had
to
suppress
the
interesting
sequel
to
her
narrative
to
wit
how
she
subsequently
matched
the
shattered
at
harrod
s
like
an
imported
plant
species
that
sometimes
flourishes
exceedingly
and
makes
itself
at
home
to
the
dwarfing
and
overshadowing
of
all
native
species
thorle
dominated
the
and
thrust
its
original
purport
somewhat
into
the
background
serena
began
to
look
helplessly
apologetic
it
was
altogether
rather
a
relief
when
the
filling
of
champagne
glasses
gave
francesca
an
excuse
for
bringing
matters
back
to
their
intended
footing
we
must
all
drink
a
health
she
said
comus
my
own
dear
boy
a
safe
and
happy
voyage
to
you
much
prosperity
in
the
life
you
are
going
out
to
and
in
due
time
a
safe
and
happy
her
hand
gave
an
involuntary
jerk
in
the
act
of
raising
the
glass
and
the
wine
went
streaming
across
the
tablecloth
in
a
froth
of
yellow
bubbles
it
certainly
was
not
turning
out
a
comfortable
or
auspicious
dinner
party
my
dear
mother
cried
comus
you
must
have
been
drinking
healths
all
the
afternoon
to
make
your
hand
so
he
laughed
gaily
and
with
apparent
carelessness
but
again
lady
veula
caught
the
frightened
note
in
his
laughter
henry
with
practical
sympathy
was
telling
francesca
two
good
ways
for
getting
wine
stains
out
of
tablecloths
the
smaller
economies
of
life
were
an
unnecessary
branch
of
learning
for
greech
but
she
studied
them
as
carefully
and
conscientiously
as
a
english
child
commits
to
memory
the
measurements
and
altitudes
of
the
world
s
principal
mountain
peaks
some
women
of
her
temperament
and
mentality
know
by
heart
the
favourite
colours
flowers
and
of
all
the
members
of
the
royal
family
greech
would
possibly
have
failed
in
an
examination
of
that
nature
but
she
knew
what
to
do
with
carrots
that
have
been
in
storage
francesca
did
not
renew
her
a
chill
seemed
to
have
fallen
over
all
efforts
at
festivity
and
she
contented
herself
with
refilling
her
glass
and
simply
drinking
to
her
boy
s
good
health
the
others
followed
her
example
and
comus
drained
his
glass
with
a
brief
thank
you
all
very
the
sense
of
constraint
which
hung
over
the
company
was
not
however
marked
by
any
uncomfortable
pause
in
the
conversation
henry
greech
was
a
fluent
thinker
of
the
kind
that
prefer
to
do
their
thinking
aloud
the
silence
that
descended
on
him
as
a
mantle
in
the
house
of
commons
was
an
official
livery
of
which
he
divested
himself
as
thoroughly
as
possible
in
private
life
he
did
not
propose
to
sit
through
dinner
as
a
mere
listener
to
thorle
s
personal
narrative
of
philanthropic
movements
and
experiences
and
took
the
first
opportunity
of
launching
himself
into
a
flow
of
satirical
observations
on
current
political
affairs
lady
veula
was
inured
to
this
sort
of
thing
in
her
own
home
circle
and
sat
listening
with
the
stoical
indifference
with
which
an
esquimau
might
accept
the
occurrence
of
one
snowstorm
the
more
in
the
course
of
an
arctic
winter
serena
golackly
felt
a
certain
relief
at
the
fact
that
her
imported
guest
was
not
after
all
monopolising
the
conversation
but
the
latter
was
too
determined
a
personality
to
allow
himself
to
be
thrust
aside
for
many
minutes
by
the
talkative
henry
greech
paused
for
an
instant
to
chuckle
at
one
of
his
own
shafts
of
satire
and
immediately
thorle
s
penetrating
voice
swept
across
the
table
oh
you
politicians
he
exclaimed
with
pleasant
superiority
you
are
always
fighting
about
how
things
should
be
done
and
the
consequence
is
you
are
never
able
to
do
anything
would
you
like
me
to
tell
you
what
a
unitarian
horsedealer
said
to
me
at
brindisi
about
politicians
a
unitarian
horsedealer
at
brindisi
had
all
the
allurement
of
the
unexpected
henry
greech
s
witticisms
at
the
expense
of
the
front
opposition
bench
were
destined
to
remain
as
unfinished
as
his
wife
s
history
of
the
broken
thorle
was
primed
with
an
ample
succession
of
stories
and
themes
chiefly
concerning
poverty
thriftlessness
reclamation
reformed
characters
and
so
forth
which
carried
him
in
an
almost
uninterrupted
sequence
through
the
remainder
of
the
dinner
what
i
want
to
do
is
to
make
people
think
he
said
turning
his
prominent
eyes
on
to
his
hostess
it
s
so
hard
to
make
people
at
any
rate
you
give
them
the
opportunity
said
comus
cryptically
as
the
ladies
rose
to
leave
the
table
comus
crossed
over
to
pick
up
one
of
lady
veula
s
gloves
that
had
fallen
to
the
floor
i
did
not
know
you
kept
a
dog
said
lady
veula
we
don
t
said
comus
there
isn
t
one
in
the
i
could
have
sworn
i
saw
one
follow
you
across
the
hall
this
evening
she
said
a
small
black
dog
something
like
a
schipperke
asked
comus
in
a
low
voice
yes
that
was
i
saw
it
myself
it
ran
from
behind
my
chair
just
as
i
was
sitting
down
don
t
say
anything
to
the
others
about
it
it
would
frighten
my
have
you
ever
seen
it
before
lady
veula
asked
quickly
once
when
i
was
six
years
old
it
followed
my
father
lady
veula
said
nothing
she
knew
that
comus
had
lost
his
father
at
the
age
of
six
in
the
serena
made
nervous
excuses
for
her
talkative
friend
really
rather
an
interesting
man
you
know
and
up
to
the
eyes
in
all
sorts
of
movements
just
the
sort
of
person
to
turn
loose
at
a
meeting
or
to
send
down
to
a
in
some
neighbourhood
given
a
and
a
harmonium
and
a
titled
woman
of
some
sort
in
the
chair
and
he
ll
be
perfectly
happy
i
must
say
i
hadn
t
realised
how
overpowering
he
might
be
at
a
small
i
should
say
he
was
a
very
good
man
said
greech
she
had
forgiven
the
mutilation
of
her
story
the
party
broke
up
early
as
most
of
the
guests
had
other
engagements
to
keep
with
a
belated
recognition
of
the
farewell
nature
of
the
occasion
they
made
pleasant
little
remarks
to
comus
with
the
usual
predictions
of
prosperity
and
anticipations
of
an
ultimate
auspicious
return
even
henry
greech
sank
his
personal
dislike
of
the
boy
for
the
moment
and
made
hearty
jocular
allusions
to
a
which
in
the
elder
man
s
eyes
seemed
possibly
pleasantly
remote
lady
veula
alone
made
no
reference
to
the
future
she
simply
said
comus
but
her
voice
was
the
kindest
of
all
and
he
responded
with
a
look
of
gratitude
the
weariness
in
her
eyes
was
more
marked
than
ever
as
she
lay
back
against
the
cushions
of
her
carriage
what
a
tragedy
life
is
she
said
aloud
to
herself
serena
and
stephen
thorle
were
the
last
to
leave
and
francesca
stood
alone
for
a
moment
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
watching
comus
laughing
and
chatting
as
he
escorted
the
departing
guests
to
the
door
the
was
melting
under
the
influence
of
coming
separation
and
never
had
he
looked
more
adorably
handsome
in
her
eyes
never
had
his
merry
laugh
and
gaiety
seemed
more
infectious
than
on
this
night
of
his
farewell
banquet
she
was
glad
enough
that
he
was
going
away
from
a
life
of
idleness
and
extravagance
and
temptation
but
she
began
to
suspect
that
she
would
miss
for
a
little
while
at
any
rate
the
boy
who
could
be
so
attractive
in
his
better
moods
her
impulse
after
the
guests
had
gone
was
to
call
him
to
her
and
hold
him
once
more
in
her
arms
and
repeat
her
wishes
for
his
happiness
and
in
the
land
he
was
going
to
and
her
promise
of
his
welcome
back
some
not
too
distant
day
to
the
land
he
was
leaving
she
wanted
to
forget
and
to
make
him
forget
the
months
of
irritable
jangling
and
sharp
discussions
the
months
of
cold
aloofness
and
indifference
and
to
remember
only
that
he
was
her
own
dear
comus
as
in
the
days
of
yore
before
he
had
grown
from
an
unmanageable
pickle
into
a
weariful
problem
but
she
feared
lest
she
should
break
down
and
she
did
not
wish
to
cloud
his
gaiety
on
the
very
eve
of
his
departure
she
watched
him
for
a
moment
as
he

her
it
had
not
been
a
very
successful
dinner
party
and
the
general
effect
it
had
left
on
her
was
one
of
depression
comus
with
a
lively
air
on
his
lips
and
a
look
of
wretchedness
in
his
eyes
went
out

sat
at
lunch
in
the
speise
saal
of
one
of
vienna
s
costlier
hotels
the
eagle
with
its
legend
everywhere
met
the
eye
and
announced
the
imperial
favour
in
which
the
establishment
basked
some
several
square
yards
of
yellow
bunting
charged
with
the
image
of
another
eagle
floating
from
the
highest
above
the
building
betrayed
to
the
initiated
the
fact
that
a
russian
grand
duke
was
concealed
somewhere
on
the
premises
unannounced
by
heraldic
symbolism
but
unconcealable

members
of
the
british
parliament
engaged
in
the
useful
task
of
proving
that
the
cost
of
living
in
vienna
was
on
an
exorbitant
scale

with
restrained
importance
through
a
land
whose
fatness
they
had
come
to
spy
out
every
fancied
in
their
bills
was
welcome
as
providing
another
nail
in
the
coffin
of
their
fiscal
opponents
it
is
the
glory
of
democracies
that
they
may
be
misled
but
never
driven
here
and
there
like
brave
deeds
in
a
world
flashed
and
glittered
the
sumptuous
uniforms
of
representatives
of
the
austrian
military
caste
also
in
evidence
at
discreet
intervals
were
stray
units
of
the
semetic
tribe
that
nineteen
centuries
of
european
neglect
had
been
unable
to
mislay
elaine
sitting
with
courtenay
at
an
elaborately
appointed
luncheon
table
gay
with
high
goblets
of
bohemian
glassware
was
mistress
of
three
discoveries
first
to
her
disappointment
that
if
you
frequent
the
more
expensive
hotels
of
europe
you
must
be
prepared
to
find
in
whatever
country
you
may
chance
to
be
staying
a
depressing
international
likeness
between
them
all
secondly
to
her
relief
that
one
is
not
expected
to
be
sentimentally
amorous
during
a
modern
honeymoon
thirdly
rather
to
her
dismay
that
courtenay
youghal
did
not
necessarily
expect
her
to
be
markedly
affectionate
in
private
someone
had
described
him
after
their
marriage
as
one
of
nature
s
bachelors
and
she
began
to
see
how
aptly
the
description
fitted
him
will
those
germans
on
our
left
never
stop
talking
she
asked
as
an
undying
flow
of
teutonic
small
talk
rattled
and
jangled
across
the
intervening
stretch
of
carpet
not
one
of
those
three
women
has
ceased
talking
for
an
instant
since
we
ve
been
sitting
they
will
presently
if
only
for
a
moment
said
courtenay
when
the
dish
you
have
ordered
comes
in
there
will
be
a
deathly
silence
at
the
next
table
no
german
can
see
a
brought
in
for
someone
else
without
being
possessed
with
a
great
fear
that
it
represents
a
more
toothsome
morsel
or
a
better
money
s
worth
than
what
he
has
ordered
for
the
exuberant
teutonic
chatter
was
balanced
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
by
an
even
more
penetrating
conversation
unflaggingly
maintained
by
a
party
of
americans
who
were
sitting
in
judgment
on
the
cuisine
of
the
country
they
were
passing
through
and
finding
few
extenuating
circumstances
what
lonkins
wants
is
a
real
cherry
pie
announced
a
lady
in
a
tone
of
dramatic
and
honest
conviction
why
yes
that
is
so
corroborated
a
gentleman
who
was
apparently
the
lonkins
in
question
a
real
cherry
we
had
the
same
trouble
way
back
in
paris
proclaimed
another
lady
little
jerome
and
the
girls
don
t
want
to
eat
any
more
i
d
give
anything
if
they
could
get
some
real
cherry
real
cherry
pie
assented
lonkins
way
down
in
ohio
we
used
to
have
peach
pie
that
was
real
good
said
lonkins
turning
on
a
tap
of
reminiscence
that
presently
flowed
to
a
cascade
the
subject
of
pies
seemed
to
lend
itself
to
indefinite
expansion
do
those
people
think
of
nothing
but
their
food
asked
elaine
as
the
virtues
of
roasted
mutton
suddenly
came
to
the
fore
and
received
emphatic
recognition
even
the
absent
and
youthful
jerome
being
quoted
in
its
favour
on
the
contrary
said
courtenay
they
are
a
set
and
the
man
has
had
a
notably
interesting
career
it
is
a
form
of
with
them
to
discuss
and
lament
the
cookery
and
foods
that
they
ve
never
had
the
leisure
to
stay
at
home
and
digest
the
wandering
jew
probably
babbled
unremittingly
about
some
breakfast
dish
that
took
so
long
to
prepare
that
he
had
never
time
to
eat
a
waiter
deposited
a
dish
of
wiener
nierenbraten
in
front
of
elaine
at
the
same
moment
a
magic
hush
fell
upon
the
three
german
ladies
at
the
adjoining
table
and
the
flicker
of
a
great
fear
passed
across
their
eyes
then
they
burst
forth
again
into
tumultuous
chatter
courtenay
had
proved
a
reliable
prophet
almost
at
the
same
moment
as
the
appeared
on
the
scene
two
ladies
arrived
at
a
neighbouring
table
and
bowed
with
dignified
cordiality
to
elaine
and
courtenay
they
were
two
of
the
more
worldly
and
travelled
of
elaine
s
extensive
stock
of
aunts
and
they
happened
to
be
making
a
short
stay
at
the
same
hotel
as
the
young
couple
they
were
far
too
correct
and
rationally
minded
to
intrude
themselves
on
their
niece
but
it
was
significant
of
elaine
s
altered
view
as
to
the
sanctity
of
honeymoon
life
that
she
secretly
rather
welcomed
the
presence
of
her
two
relatives
in
the
hotel
and
had
found
time
and
occasion
to
give
them
more
of
her
society
than
she
would
have
considered
necessary
or
desirable
a
few
weeks
ago
the
younger
of
the
two
she
rather
liked
in
a
restrained
fashion
as
one
likes
an
unpretentious
or
a
restaurant
that
does
not
try
to
give
one
a
musical
education
in
addition
to
one
s
dinner
one
felt
instinctively
about
her
that
she
would
never
wear
rather
more
valuable
diamonds
than
any
other
woman
in
the
room
and
would
never
be
the
only
person
to
be
saved
in
a
steamboat
disaster
or
hotel
fire
as
a
child
she
might
have
been
perfectly
well
able
to
recite
on
linden
when
the
sun
was
low
but
one
felt
certain
that
nothing
ever
induced
her
to
do
so
the
elder
aunt
goldbrook
did
not
share
her
sister
s
character
as
a
human
most
people
found
her
rather
disturbing
chiefly
perhaps
from
her
habit
of
asking
unimportant
questions
with
enormous
solemnity
her
manner
of
enquiring
after
a
trifling
ailment
gave
one
the
impression
that
she
was
more
concerned
with
the
fortunes
of
the
malady
than
with
oneself
and
when
one
got
rid
of
a
cold
one
felt
that
she
almost
expected
to
be
given
its
postal
address
probably
her
manner
was
merely
the
defensive
outwork
of
an
innate
shyness
but
she
was
not
a
woman
who
commanded
confidences
a
telephone
call
for
courtenay
commented
the
younger
of
the
two
women
as
youghal
hurriedly
flashed
through
the
room
the
telephone
system
seems
to
enter
very
largely
into
that
young
man
s
the
telephone
has
robbed
matrimony
of
most
of
its
sting
said
the
elder
so
much
more
discreet
than
pen
and
ink
communications
which
get
read
by
the
wrong
elaine
s
aunts
were
conscientiously
worldly
they
were
the
natural
outcome
of
a
stock
that
had
been
conscientiously
for
many
generations
elaine
had
progressed
to
the
pancake
stage
before
courtenay
returned
sorry
to
be
away
so
long
he
said
but
i
ve
arranged
something
rather
nice
for
there
s
rather
a
jolly
masquerade
ball
on
i
ve
phoned
about
getting
a
costume
for
you
and
it
s
alright
it
will
suit
you
beautifully
and
i
ve
got
my
harlequin
dress
with
me
madame
kelnicort
excellent
soul
is
going
to
chaperone
you
and
she
ll
take
you
back
any
time
you
like
i
m
quite
unreliable
when
i
get
into
fancy
dress
i
shall
probably
keep
going
till
some
unearthly
hour
of
the
a
masquerade
ball
in
a
strange
city
hardly
represented
elaine
s
idea
of
enjoyment
carefully
to
disguise
one
s
identity
in
a
neighbourhood
where
one
was
entirely
unknown
seemed
to
her
rather
meaningless
with
courtenay
of
course
it
was
different
he
seemed
to
have
friends
and
acquaintances
everywhere
however
the
matter
had
progressed
to
a
point
which
would
have
made
a
refusal
to
go
seem
rather
ungracious
elaine
finished
her
pancake
and
began
to
take
a
polite
interest
in
her
costume
what
is
your
character
asked
madame
kelnicort
that
evening
as
they
uncloaked
preparatory
to
entering
the
already
crowded
i
believe
i
m
supposed
to
represent
marjolaine
de
montfort
whoever
she
may
have
been
said
elaine
courtenay
declares
he
only
wanted
to
marry
me
because
i
m
his
ideal
of
but
what
a
mistake
to
go
as
a
character
you
know
nothing
about
to
enjoy
a
masquerade
ball
you
ought
to
throw
away
your
own
self
and
be
the
character
you
represent
now
courtenay
has
been
harlequin
since
through
dinner
i
could
see
it
dancing
in
his
eyes
at
about
six
o
clock
morning
he
will
fall
asleep
and
wake
up
a
member
of
the
british
house
of
parliament
on
his
honeymoon
but
he
is
unrestrainedly
elaine
stood
in
the
surrounded
by
a
laughing
jostling
throng
of
pierrots
jockeys
shepherdesses
roumanian
and
all
the
lively
creatures
that
form
the
ingredients
of
a
ball
as
she
stood
watching
them
she
experienced
a
growing
feeling
of
annoyance
chiefly
with
herself
she
was
assisting
as
the
french
say
at
one
of
the
gayest
scenes
of
europe
s
gayest
capital
and
she
was
conscious
of
being
absolutely
unaffected
by
the
gaiety
around
her
the
costumes
were
certainly
interesting
to
look
at
and
the
music
good
to
listen
to
and
to
that
extent
she
was
amused
but
the
of
the
scene
made
no
appeal
to
her
it
was
like
watching
a
game
of
which
you
did
not
know
the
rules
and
in
the
issue
of
which
you
were
not
interested
elaine
began
to
wonder
what
was
the
earliest
moment
at
which
she
could
drag
madame
kelnicort
away
from
the
revel
without
being
guilty
of
sheer
cruelty
then
courtenay
wriggled
out
of
the
crush
and
came
towards
her
a
joyous
laughing
courtenay
looking
younger
and
handsomer
than
she
had
ever
seen
him
she
could
scarcely
recognise
in
him
the
rising
young
debater
who
made
embarrassing
onslaughts
on
the
government
s
foreign
policy
before
a
crowded
house
of
commons
he
claimed
her
for
the
dance
that
was
just
starting
and
steered
her
dexterously
into
the
heart
of
the
waltzing
crowd
you
look
more
like
marjolaine
than
i
should
have
thought
a
mortal
woman
of
these
days
could
look
he
declared
only
marjolaine
did
smile
sometimes
you
have
rather
the
air
of
wondering
if
you
d
left
out
enough
tea
for
the
servants
breakfast
don
t
mind
my
teasing
i
love
you
to
look
like
that
and
besides
it
makes
a
splendid
foil
to
my
selfishness
coming
to
the
fore
again
you
see
but
you
really
are
to
go
home
the
moment
you
re
bored
the
excellent
kelnicort
gets
heaps
of
dances
throughout
the
winter
so
don
t
mind
sacrificing
a
little
later
in
the
evening
elaine
found
herself
standing
out
a
dance
with
a
grave
young
gentleman
from
the
russian
embassy
monsieur
courtenay
enjoys
himself
doesn
t
he
he
observed
as
the
harlequin
flashed
past
them
looking
like
some
restless
dragonfly
why
is
it
that
the
good
god
has
given
your
countrymen
the
boon
of
eternal
youth
some
of
your
countrywomen
too
but
all
of
the
elaine
could
think
of
many
of
her
countrymen
who
were
not
and
never
could
have
been
youthful
but
as
far
as
courtenay
was
concerned
she
recognised
the
fitness
of
the
remark
and
the
recognition
carried
with
it
a
sense
of
depression
would
he
always
remain
youthful
and
keen
on
gaiety
and
revelling
while
she
grew
staid
and
retiring
she
had
thrust
the
lively
intractable
comus
out
of
her
mind
as
by
his
perverseness
he
had
thrust
himself
out
of
her
heart
and
she
had
chosen
the
brilliant
young
man
of
affairs
as
her
husband
he
had
honestly
let
her
see
the
selfish
side
of
his
character
while
he
was
courting
her
but
she
had
been
prepared
to
make
due
sacrifices
to
the
selfishness
of
a
public
man
who
had
his
career
to
consider
above
all
other
things
would
she
also
have
to
make
sacrifices
to
the
harlequin
spirit
which
was
now
revealing
itself
as
an
undercurrent
in
his
nature
when
one
has
inured
oneself
to
the
idea
of
a
particular
form
of
victimisation
it
is
disconcerting
to
be
confronted
with
another
many
a
man
who
would
patiently
undergo
martyrdom
for
religion
s
sake
would
be
furiously
unwilling
to
be
a
martyr
to
neuralgia
i
think
that
is
why
you
english
love
animals
so
much
pursued
the
young
diplomat
you
are
such
splendid
animals
yourselves
you
are
lively
because
you
want
to
be
lively
not
because
people
are
looking
on
at
you
monsieur
courtenay
is
certainly
an
animal
i
mean
it
as
a
high
am
i
an
animal
asked
elaine
i
was
going
to
say
you
are
an
angel
said
the
russian
in
some
embarrassment
but
i
do
not
think
that
would
do
angels
and
animals
would
never
get
on
together
to
get
on
with
animals
you
must
have
a
sense
of
humour
and
i
don
t
suppose
angels
have
any
sense
of
humour
you
see
it
would
be
no
use
to
them
as
they
never
hear
any
perhaps
said
elaine
with
a
tinge
of
bitterness
in
her
voice
perhaps
i
am
a
i
think
you
most
remind
me
of
a
picture
said
the
russian
it
was
not
the
first
time
elaine
had
heard
the
simile
i
know
she
said
the
narrow
gallery
at
the
louvre
attributed
to
leonardo
da
evidently
the
impression
she
made
on
people
was
solely
one
of
externals
was
that
how
courtenay
regarded
her
was
that
to
be
her
function
and
place
in
life
a
painted
background
a
decorative
setting
to
other
people
s
triumphs
and
tragedies
somehow
she
had
the
feeling
that
a
general
might
have
who
brought
imposing
forces
into
the
field
and
could
do
nothing
with
them
she
possessed
youth
and
good
looks
considerable
wealth
and
had
just
made
what
would
be
thought
by
most
people
a
very
satisfactory
marriage
and
already
she
seemed
to
be
standing
aside
as
an
onlooker
where
she
had
expected
herself
to
be
taking
a
leading
part
does
this
sort
of
thing
appeal
to
you
she
asked
the
young
russian
nodding
towards
the
gay
scrimmage
of
masqueraders
and
rather
prepared
to
hear
an
amused
but
yes
of
course
he
answered
costume
balls
fancy
fairs
café
chantant
casino
anything
that
is
not
real
life
appeals
to
us
russians
real
life
with
us
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
maxim
gorki
deals
in
it
interests
us
immensely
but
we
like
to
get
away
from
it
madame
kelnicort
came
up
with
another
prospective
partner
and
elaine
delivered
her
ukase
one
more
dance
and
then
back
to
the
hotel
without
any
special
regret
she
made
her
retreat
from
the
revel
which
courtenay
was
enjoying
under
the
impression
that
it
was
life
and
the
young
russian
under
the
firm
conviction
that
it
was
not
elaine
breakfasted
at
her
aunts
table
the
next
morning
at
much
her
usual
hour
courtenay
was
sleeping
the
sleep
of
a
happy
tired
animal
he
had
given
instructions
to
be
called
at
eleven
o
clock
from
which
time
onward
the
freie
the
and
his
toilet
would
occupy
his
attention
till
he
appeared
at
the
luncheon
table
there
were
not
many
people
breakfasting
when
elaine
arrived
on
the
scene
but
the
room
seemed
to
be
fuller
than
it
really
was
by
reason
of
a
penetrating
voice
that
was
engaged
in
recounting
how
far
the
standard
of
viennese
breakfast
fare
fell
below
the
expectations
and
desires
of
little

the
girls
if
ever
little
jerome
becomes

said
elaine
i
shall
be
able
to
contribute
quite
an
informing
article
on
his
gastronomic
likes
and
dislikes
to
the
the
aunts
were
discreetly
inquisitive
as
to
the
previous
evening
s
entertainment
if
elaine
would
flirt
mildly
with
somebody
it
would
be
such
a
good
thing
said
goldbrook
it
would
remind
courtenay
that
he
s
not
the
only
attractive
young
man
in
the
elaine
however
did
not
gratify
their
hopes
she
referred
to
the
ball
with
the
detachment
she
would
have
shown
in
describing
a
show
of
cottage
industries
it
was
not
difficult
to
discern
in
her
description
of
the
affair
the
confession
that
she
had
been
slightly
bored
from
courtenay
later
in
the
day
the
aunts
received
a
much
livelier
impression
of
the
festivities
from
which
it
was
abundantly
clear
that
he
at
any
rate
had
managed
to
amuse
himself
neither
did
it
appear
that
his
good
opinion
of
his
own
attractions
had
suffered
any
serious
shock
he
was
distinctly
in
a
very
good
temper
the
secret
of
enjoying
a
honeymoon
said
goldbrook
afterwards
to
her
sister
is
not
to
attempt
too
you
courtenay
is
content
to
try
and
keep
one
person
amused
and
happy
and
he
thoroughly
i
certainly
don
t
think
elaine
is
going
to
be
very
happy
said
her
sister
but
at
least
courtenay
saved
her
from
making
the
greatest
mistake
she
could
have
that
young
he
has
also
said
goldbrook
helped
her
to
make
the
next
biggest
mistake
of
her
courtenay
chapter
xvi
it
was
late
afternoon
by
the
banks
of
a
swiftly
rushing
river
a
river
that
gave
back
a
haze
of
heat
from
its
waters
as
though
it
were
some
stagnant
steaming
lagoon
and
yet
seemed
to
be
whirling
onward
with
the
determination
of
a
living
thing
perpetually
eager
and
remorseless
leaping
savagely
at
any
obstacle
that
attempted
to
stay
its
course
an
unfriendly
river
to
whose
waters
you
committed
yourself
at
your
peril
under
the
hot
breathless
shade
of
the
trees
on
its
shore
arose
that
acrid
smell
that
seems
to
hang
everywhere
about
the
tropics
a
smell
as
of
some
monstrous
musty
where
herbs
and
spices
have
been
crushed
and
distilled
and
stored
for
hundreds
of
years
and
where
the
windows
have
seldom
been
opened
in
the
dazzling
heat
that
still
held
undisputed
sway
over
the
scene
insects
and
birds
seemed
preposterously
alive
and
active
flitting
their
gay
colours
through
the
sunbeams
and
crawling
over
the
baked
dust
in
the
full
swing
and
pursuit
of
their
several
businesses
the
flies
engaged
in
heaven
knows
what
and
the
busy
with
the
flies
beasts
and
humans
showed
no
such
indifference
to
the
temperature
the
sun
would
have
to
slant
yet
further
downward
before
the
earth
would
become
a
fit
arena
for
their
revived
activities
in
the
sheltered
basement
of
a
wayside
a
gang
of
native
slept
or
chattered
drowsily
through
the
last
hours
of
the
long
halt
wide
awake
yet
almost
motionless
in
the
thrall
of
a
heavy
lassitude
their
european
master
sat
alone
in
an
upper
chamber
staring
out
through
a
narrow
at
the
native
village
spreading
away
in
thick
clusters
of
huts
girt
around
with
cultivated
vegetation
it
seemed
a
vast
human
which
would
presently
be
astir
with
its
teeming
human
life
as
though
the
sun
god
in
his
last
departing
stride
had
roused
it
with
a
careless
kick
even
as
comus
watched
he
could
see
the
beginnings
of
the
evening
s
awakening
women
squatting
in
front
of
their
huts
began
to
pound
away
at
the
rice
or
maize
that
would
form
the
evening
meal
girls
were
collecting
their
water
pots
preparatory
to
a
walk
down
to
the
river
and
enterprising
goats
made
tentative
forays
through
gaps
in
the
fences
of
neighbouring
garden
plots
their
hurried
retreats
showed
that
here
at
least
someone
was
keeping
alert
and
wakeful
vigil
behind
a
hut
perched
on
a
steep
hillside
just
opposite
to
the
two
boys
were
splitting
wood
with
a
certain
languid
industry
further
down
the
road
a
group
of
dogs
were
leisurely
working
themselves
up
to
quarrelling
pitch
here
and
there
bands
of
pigs
roamed
about
busy
with
foraging
excursions
that
came
unpleasantly
athwart
the
of
scavenging
and
from
the
trees
that
bounded
and
intersected
the
village
rose
the
horrible
tireless
squawking
of
the
crows
comus
sat
and
watched
it
all
with
a
sense
of
growing
aching
depression
it
was
so
utterly
trivial
to
his
eyes
so
devoid
of
interest
and
yet
it
was
so
real
so
serious
so
implacable
in
its
continuity
the
brain
grew
tired
with
the
thought
of
its
unceasing
reproduction
it
had
all
gone
on
as
it
was
going
on
now
by
the
side
of
the
great
rushing
swirling
river
this
tilling
and
planting
and
harvesting
marketing
and
and
and
burying
and
giving
in
marriage
and
all
this
had
been
going
on
in
the
shimmering
blistering
heat
and
the
warm
nights
while
he
had
been
a
youngster
at
school
dimly
recognising
africa
as
a
division
of
the
earth
s
surface
that
it
was
advisable
to
have
a
certain
nodding
acquaintance
with
it
had
been
going
on
in
all
its
trifling
detail
all
its
serious
intensity
when
his
father
and
his
grandfather
in
their
day
had
been
little
boys
at
school
it
would
go
on
just
as
intently
as
ever
long
after
comus
and
his
generation
had
passed
away
just
as
the
shadows
would
lengthen
and
fade
under
the
mulberry
trees
in
that
far
away
english
garden
round
the
old
stone
fountain
where
a
leaden
otter
for
ever
preyed
on
a
leaden
salmon
comus
rose
impatiently
from
his
seat
and
walked
wearily
across
the
hut
to
another
which
commanded
a
broad
view
of
the
river
there
was
something
which
fascinated
and
then
depressed
one
in
its
ceaseless
hurrying
onward
sweep
its
tons
of
water
rushing
on
for
all
time
as
long
as
the
face
of
the
earth
should
remain
unchanged
on
its
further
shore
could
be
seen
spread
out
at
intervals
other
teeming
villages
with
their
cultivated
plots
and
pasture
clearings
their
moving
dots
which
meant
cattle
and
goats
and
dogs
and
children
and
far
up
its
course
lost
in
the
forest
growth
that
fringed
its
banks
were
hidden
away
yet
more
villages
human
where
men
dwelt
and
worked
and
bartered
squabbled
and
worshipped
sickened
and
perished
while
the
river
went
by
with
its
endless
swirl
and
rush
of
gleaming
waters
one
could
well
understand
primitive
early
races
making
propitiatory
sacrifices
to
the
spirit
of
a
great
river
on
whose
shores
they
dwelt
time
and
the
river
were
the
two
great
forces
that
seemed
to
matter
here
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
turn
back
to
that
other
outlook
and
watch
the
village
life
that
was
now
beginning
to
wake
in
earnest
the
procession
of
had
formed
itself
in
a
long
chattering
line
that
stretched
comus
wondered
how
many
tens
of
thousands
of
times
that
procession
had
been
formed
since
first
the
village
came
into
existence
they
had
been
doing
it
while
he
was
playing
in
the
at
school
while
he
was
spending
christmas
holidays
in
paris
while
he
was
going
his
careless
round
of
theatres
dances
suppers
and
just
as
they
were
doing
it
now
they
would
be
doing
it
when
there
was
no
one
alive
who
remembered
comus
bassington
this
thought
recurred
again
and
again
with
painful
persistence
a
morbid
growth
arising
in
part
from
his
loneliness
staring
dumbly
out
at
the
toiling
sweltering
human
comus
marvelled
how
missionary
enthusiasts
could
labour
hopefully
at
the
work
of
transplanting
their
religion
with
its
homegrown
accretions
of
fatherly
parochial
benevolence
in
this
wilderness
where
men
lived
like
groundbait
and
died
like
flies
demons
one
might
believe
in
if
one
did
not
hold
one
s
imagination
in
healthy
check
but
a
kindly
god
never
somewhere
in
the
west
country
of
england
comus
had
an
uncle
who
lived
in
a
rectory
and
taught
a
wholesome
creed
that
expressed
itself
in
the
spirit
of
little
lamb
who
made
thee
and
faithfully
reflected
the
beautiful
homely
sentiment
of
saxon
europe
what
a
far
away
unreal
fairy
story
it
all
seemed
here
in
this
west
african
land
where
the
bodies
of
men
were
of
as
little
account
as
the
bubbles
that
floated
on
the
oily
froth
of
the
great
flowing
river
and
where
it
required
a
stretch
of
wild
profitless
imagination
to
credit
them
with
undying
souls
in
the
life
he
had
come
from
comus
had
been
accustomed
to
think
of
individuals
as
definite
masterful
personalities
making
their
several
marks
on
the
circumstances
that
revolved
around
them
they
did
well
or
ill
or
in
most
cases
indifferently
and
were
criticised
praised
blamed
thwarted
or
tolerated
or
given
way
to
in
any
case
humdrum
or
outstanding
they
had
their
spheres
of
importance
little
or
big
they
dominated
a
breakfast
table
or
harassed
a
government
according
to
their
capabilities
or
opportunities
or
perhaps
they
merely
had
irritating
mannerisms
at
any
rate
it
seemed
highly
probable
that
they
had
souls
here
a
man
simply
made
a
unit
in
an
unnumbered
population
an
inconsequent
dot
in
a
deathroll
even
his
own
position
as
a
white
man
exalted
conspicuously
above
a
horde
of
black
natives
did
not
save
comus
from
the
depressing
sense
of
nothingness
which
his
first
experience
of
fever
had
thrown
over
him
he
was
a
lost
soulless
body
in
this
great
uncaring
land
if
he
died
another
would
take
his
place
his
few
effects
would
be
inventoried
and
sent
down
to
the
coast
someone
else
would
finish
off
any
tea
or
whisky
that
he
left
would
be
all
it
was
nearly
time
to
be
starting
towards
the
next
halting
place
where
he
would
dine
or
at
any
rate
eat
something
but
the
lassitude
which
the
fever
had
bequeathed
him
made
the
tedium
of
travelling
through
interminable
a
weariness
to
be
deferred
as
long
as
possible
the
bearers
were
nothing
loth
to
let
another
or
so
slip
by
and
comus
dragged
a
battered
novel
from
the
pocket
of
his
coat
it
was
a
story
dealing
with
the
elaborately
tangled
love
affairs
of
a
surpassingly
uninteresting
couple
and
even
in
his
almost
bookless
state
comus
had
not
been
able
to
plough
his
way
through
more
than
of
its
dull
length
bound
up
with
the
cover
however
were
some
pages
of
advertisement
and
these
the
exile
scanned
with
a
hungry
intentness
that
the
romance
itself
could
never
have
commanded
the
name
of
a
shop
of
a
street
the
address
of
a
restaurant
came
to
him
as
a
bitter
reminder
of
the
world
he
had
lost
a
world
that
ate
and
drank
and
flirted
gambled
and
made
merry
a
world
that
debated
and
intrigued
and
fought
or
compromised
political
recked
nothing
of
its
outcasts
wandering
through
forest
paths
and
steamy
swamps
or
lying
in
the
grip
of
fever
comus
read
and
those
few
lines
of
advertisement
just
as
he
treasured
a
programme
of
a
performance
at
the
straw
exchange
theatre
they
seemed
to
make
a
little
more
real
the
past
that
was
already
so
shadowy
and
so
utterly
remote
for
a
moment
he
could
almost
capture
the
sensation
of
being
once
again
in
those
haunts
that
he
loved
then
he
looked
round
and
pushed
the
book
wearily
from
him
the
steaming
heat
the
forest
the
rushing
river
hemmed
him
in
on
all
sides
the
two
boys
who
had
been
splitting
wood
ceased
from
their
labours
and
straightened
their
backs
suddenly
the
smaller
of
the
two
gave
the
other
a
resounding
whack
with
a
split
lath
that
he
still
held
in
his
hand
and
flew
up
the
hillside
with
a
scream
of
laughter
and
simulated
terror
the
bigger
lad
following
in
hot
pursuit
up
and
down
the
steep
slope
they
raced
and
twisted
and
dodged
coming
sometimes
to
close
quarters
in
a
hurricane
of
squeals
and
smacks
rolling
over
and
over
like
fighting
kittens
and
breaking
away
again
to
start
fresh
provocation
and
fresh
pursuit
now
and
again
they
would
lie
for
a
time
panting
in
what
seemed
the
last
stage
of
exhaustion
and
then
they
would
be
off
in
another
wild
scamper
their
dusky
bodies
flitting
through
the
bushes
disappearing
and
reappearing
with
equal
suddenness
presently
two
girls
of
their
own
age
who
had
returned
from
the
sprang
out
on
them
from
ambush
and
the
four
joined
in
one
joyous
gambol
that
lit
up
the
hillside
with
shrill
echoes
and
glimpses
of
flying
limbs
comus
sat
and
watched
at
first
with
an
amused
interest
then
with
a
returning
flood
of
depression
and
those
wild
young
human
kittens
represented
the
joy
of
life
he
was
the
outsider
the
lonely
alien
watching
something
in
which
he
could
not
join
a
happiness
in
which
he
had
no
part
or
lot
he
would
pass
presently
out
of
the
village
and
his
bearers
feet
would
leave
their
indentations
in
the
dust
that
would
be
his
most
permanent
memorial
in
this
little
oasis
of
teeming
life
and
that
other
life
in
which
he
once
moved
with
such
confident
sense
of
his
own
necessary
participation
in
it
how
completely
he
had
passed
out
of
it
amid
all
its
laughing
throngs
its
card
parties
and
and
gatherings
he
was
just
a
mere

forgotten

went
away
he
had
loved
himself
very
well
and
never
troubled
greatly
whether
anyone
else
really
loved
him
and
now
he
realised
what
he
had
made
of
his
life
and
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
if
his
chance
were
to
come
again
he
would
throw
it
away
just
as
surely
just
as
perversely
fate
played
with
him
with
loaded
dice
he
would
lose
always

for
him

a

mounted
up
between

and

and
across
it
there
blew
that
that
chills
or
kills
affection
the
words
of
a
old
song
the
wistful
cry
of

lost

rang
with
insistent
mockery

ever
his
epitaph
in
the
mouths
of
those
that
remembered
him

be

the
boy
who
never
came
back
and
in
his
unutterable
loneliness

his

not
see

joyous
scrambling
frolic

chapter

the
bleak
rawness
of
a
grey
december
day
held
sway
over
james
s
park
that
sanctuary
of
lawn
and
tree
and
pool
into
which
the
bourgeois
innovator
has
rushed
ambitiously
time
and
again
to
find
that
he
must
take
the
patent
leather
from
off
his
feet
for
the
ground
on
which
he
stands
is
hallowed
ground
in
the
lonely
hour
of
early
afternoon
when
the
workers
had
gone
back
to
their
work
and
the
loiterers
were
scarcely
yet
gathered
again
francesca
bassington
made
her
way
restlessly
along
the
stretches
of
gravelled
walk
that
bordered
the
ornamental
water
the
overmastering
unhappiness
that
filled
her
heart
and
stifled
her
thinking
powers
found
answering
echo
in
her
surroundings
there
is
a
sorrow
that
lingers
in
old
parks
and
gardens
that
the
busy
streets
have
no
leisure
to
keep
by
them
the
dead
must
bury
their
dead
in
whitehall
or
the
place
de
la
concorde
but
there
are
quieter
spots
where
they
may
still
keep
tryst
with
the
living
and
intrude
the
memory
of
their
bygone
selves
on
generations
that
have
almost
forgotten
them
even
in
versailles
the
desolation
of
a
tragedy
that
can
not
die
haunts
the
terraces
and
fountains
like
a
bloodstain
that
will
not
wash
out
in
the
saxon
garden
at
warsaw
there
broods
the
memory
of
things
coeval
with
the
stately
trees
that
shade
its
walks
and
with
the
carp
that
swim
in
its
ponds
as
they
doubtless
swam
there
when
lieber
augustin
was
a
living
person
and
not
as
yet
an
immortal
couplet
and
james
s
park
with
its
lawns
and
walks
and
waterfowl
harbours
still
its
associations
with
a
bygone
order
of
men
and
women
whose
happiness
and
sadness
are
woven
into
its
history
dim
and
grey
as
they
were
once
bright
and
glowing
like
the
faded
pattern
worked
into
the
fabric
of
an
old
tapestry
it
was
here
that
francesca
had
made
her
way
when
the
intolerable
inaction
of
waiting
had
driven
her
forth
from
her
home
she
was
waiting
for
that
worst
news
of
all
the
news
which
does
not
kill
hope
because
there
has
been
none
to
kill
but
merely
ends
suspense
an
early
message
had
said
that
comus
was
ill
which
might
have
meant
much
or
little
then
there
had
come
that
morning
a
cablegram
which
only
meant
one
thing
in
a
few
hours
she
would
get
a
final
message
of
which
this
was
the
preparatory
forerunner
she
already
knew
as
much
as
that
awaited
message
would
tell
her
she
knew
that
she
would
never
see
comus
again
and
she
knew
now
that
she
loved
him
beyond
all
things
that
the
world
could
hold
for
her
it
was
no
sudden
rush
of
pity
or
compunction
that
clouded
her
judgment
or
gilded
her
recollection
of
him
she
saw
him
as
he
was
the
beautiful
wayward
laughing
boy
with
his
naughtiness
his
exasperating
selfishness
his
insurmountable
folly
and
perverseness
his
cruelty
that
spared
not
even
himself
and
as
he
was
as
he
always
had
been
she
knew
that
he
was
the
one
thing
that
the
fates
had
willed
that
she
should
love
she
did
not
stop
to
accuse
or
excuse
herself
for
having
sent
him
forth
to
what
was
to
prove
his
death
it
was
doubtless
right
and
reasonable
that
he
should
have
gone
out
there
as
hundreds
of
other
men
went
out
in
pursuit
of
careers
the
terrible
thing
was
that
he
would
never
come
back
the
old
cruel
hopelessness
that
had
always
chequered
her
pride
and
pleasure
in
his
good
looks
and
high
spirits
and
fitfully
charming
ways
had
dealt
her
a
last
crushing
blow
he
was
dying
somewhere
thousands
of
miles
away
without
hope
of
recovery
without
a
word
of
love
to
comfort
him
and
without
hope
or
shred
of
consolation
she
was
waiting
to
hear
of
the
end
the
end
that
last
dreadful
piece
of
news
which
would
write
nevermore
across
his
life
and
hers
the
lively
bustle
in
the
streets
had
been
a
torture
that
she
could
not
bear
it
wanted
but
two
days
to
christmas
and
the
gaiety
of
the
season
forced
or
genuine
rang
out
everywhere
christmas
shopping
with
its
anxious
solicitude
or
absorption
overspread
the
west
end
and
made
the
pavements
scarcely
passable
at
certain
favoured
points
proud
parents
and
surrounded
by
escorts
of
their
young
people
compared
notes
with
one
another
on
the
looks
and
qualities
of
their
offspring
and
exchanged
loud
hurried
confidences
on
the
difficulty
or
success
which
each
had
experienced
in
getting
the
right
presents
for
one
and
all
shouted
directions
where
to
find
this
or
that
article
at
its
best
mingled
with
salvos
of
christmas
good
wishes
to
francesca
making
her
way
frantically
through
the
carnival
of
happiness
with
that
lonely
deathbed
in
her
eyes
it
had
seemed
a
callous
mockery
of
her
pain
could
not
people
remember
that
there
were
crucifixions
as
well
as
joyous
birthdays
in
the
world
every
mother
that
she
passed
happy
in
the
company
of
a
schoolboy
son
sent
a
fresh
stab
at
her
heart
and
the
very
shops
had
their
bitter
memories
there
was
the
where
he
and
she
had
often
taken
tea
together
or
in
the
days
of
their
estrangement
sat
with
their
separate
friends
at
separate
tables
there
were
other
shops
where
bills
had
furnished
material
for
those
frequently
recurring
scenes
of
recrimination
and
the
colonial
outfitters
where
as
he
had
phrased
it
in
whimsical
mockery
he
had
bought
for
his
the
oubliette
she
remembered
the
bitter
petulant
name
he
had
flung
at
his
destined
exile
there
at
least
he
had
been
harder
on
himself
than
the
fates
were
pleased
to
will
never
as
long
as
francesca
lived
and
had
a
brain
that
served
her
would
she
be
able
to
forget
that
narcotic
would
never
be
given
to
her
unrelenting
unsparing
memory
would
be
with
her
always
to
remind
her
of
those
last
days
of
tragedy
already
her
mind
was
dwelling
on
the
details
of
that
ghastly
farewell
and
recalling
one
by
one
the
incidents
of
that
had
marked
it
how
they
had
sat
down
seven
to
table
and
how
one
liqueur
glass
in
the
set
of
seven
had
been
shivered
into
fragments
how
her
glass
had
slipped
from
her
hand
as
she
raised
it
to
her
lips
to
wish
comus
a
safe
return
and
the
strange
quiet
hopelessness
of
lady
veula
s
she
remembered
now
how
it
had
chilled
and
frightened
her
at
the
moment
the
park
was
filling
again
with
its
floating
population
of
loiterers
and
francesca
s
footsteps
began
to
take
a
homeward
direction
something
seemed
to
tell
her
that
the
message
for
which
she
waited
had
arrived
and
was
lying
there
on
the
hall
table
her
brother
who
had
announced
his
intention
of
visiting
her
early
in
the
afternoon
would
have
gone
by
now
he
knew
nothing
of
this
morning
s
bad
instinct
of
a
wounded
animal
to
creep
away
by
itself
had
prompted
her
to
keep
her
sorrow
from
him
as
long
as
possible
his
visit
did
not
necessitate
her
presence
he
was
bringing
an
austrian
friend
who
was
compiling
a
work
on
the
school
of
painting
to
inspect
the
van
der
meulen
which
henry
greech
hoped
might
perhaps
figure
as
an
illustration
in
the
book
they
were
due
to
arrive
shortly
after
lunch
and
francesca
had
left
a
note
of
apology
pleading
an
urgent
engagement
elsewhere
as
she
turned
to
make
her
way
across
the
mall
into
the
green
park
a
gentle
voice
hailed
her
from
a
carriage
that
was
just
drawing
up
by
the
sidewalk
lady
caroline
benaresq
had
been
favouring
the
victoria
memorial
with
a
long
unfriendly
stare
in
primitive
days
she
remarked
i
believe
it
was
the
fashion
for
great
chiefs
and
rulers
to
have
large
numbers
of
their
relatives
and
dependents
killed
and
buried
with
them
in
these
more
enlightened
times
we
have
invented
quite
another
way
of
making
a
great
sovereign
universally
regretted
my
dear
francesca
she
broke
off
suddenly
catching
the
misery
that
had
settled
in
the
other
s
eyes
what
is
the
matter
have
you
had
bad
news
from
out
there
i
am
waiting
for
very
bad
news
said
francesca
and
lady
caroline
knew
what
had
happened
i
wish
i
could
say
something
i
can
lady
caroline
spoke
in
a
harsh
grunting
voice
that
few
people
had
ever
heard
her
use
francesca
crossed
the
mall
and
the
carriage
drove
on
heaven
help
that
poor
woman
said
lady
caroline
which
was
for
her
startlingly
like
a
prayer
as
francesca
entered
the
hall
she
gave
a
quick
look
at
the
table
several
packages
evidently
an
early
batch
of
christmas
presents
were
there
and
two
or
three
letters
on
a
salver
by
itself
was
the
cablegram
for
which
she
had
waited
a
maid
who
had
evidently
been
on
the
lookout
for
her
brought
her
the
salver
the
servants
were
well
aware
of
the
dreadful
thing
that
was
happening
and
there
was
pity
on
the
girl
s
face
and
in
her
voice
this
came
for
you
ten
minutes
ago
ma
am
and
greech
has
been
here
ma
am
with
another
gentleman
and
was
sorry
you
weren
t
at
home
greech
said
he
would
call
again
in
about
francesca
carried
the
cablegram
unopened
into
the
and
sat
down
for
a
moment
to
think
there
was
no
need
to
read
it
yet
for
she
knew
what
she
would
find
written
there
for
a
few
pitiful
moments
comus
would
seem
less
hopelessly
lost
to
her
if
she
put
off
the
reading
of
that
last
terrible
message
she
rose
and
crossed
over
to
the
windows
and
pulled
down
the
blinds
shutting
out
the
waning
december
day
and
then
reseated
herself
perhaps
in
the
shadowy
her
boy
would
come
and
sit
with
her
again
for
awhile
and
let
her
look
her
last
upon
his
loved
face
she
could
never
touch
him
again
or
hear
his
laughing
petulant
voice
but
surely
she
might
look
on
her
dead
and
her
starving
eyes
saw
only
the
hateful
soulless
things
of
bronze
and
silver
and
porcelain
that
she
had
set
up
and
worshipped
as
gods
look
where
she
would
they
were
there
around
her
the
cold
ruling
deities
of
the
home
that
held
no
place
for
her
dead
boy
he
had
moved
in
and
out
among
them
the
warm
living
breathing
thing
that
had
been
hers
to
love
and
she
had
turned
her
eyes
from
that
youthful
comely
figure
to
adore
a
few
feet
of
painted
canvas
a
musty
relic
of
a
long
departed
craftsman
and
now
he
was
gone
from
her
sight
from
her
touch
from
her
hearing
for
ever
without
even
a
thought
to
flash
between
them
for
all
the
dreary
years
that
she
should
live
and
these
things
of
canvas
and
pigment
and
wrought
metal
would
stay
with
her
they
were
her
soul
and
what
shall
it
profit
a
man
if
he
save
his
soul
and
slay
his
heart
in
torment
on
a
small
table
by
her
side
was
mervyn
quentock
s
portrait
of
prophetic
symbol
of
her
tragedy
the
rich
dead
harvest
of
unreal
things
that
had
never
known
life
and
the
bleak
thrall
of
black
unending
winter
a
winter
in
which
things
died
and
knew
no
francesca
turned
to
the
small
envelope
lying
in
her
lap
very
slowly
she
opened
it
and
read
the
short
message
then
she
sat
numb
and
silent
for
a
long
long
time
or
perhaps
only
for
minutes
the
voice
of
henry
greech
in
the
hall
enquiring
for
her
called
her
to
herself
hurriedly
she
crushed
the
piece
of
paper
out
of
sight
he
would
have
to
be
told
of
course
but
just
yet
her
pain
seemed
too
dreadful
to
be
laid
bare
comus
is
dead
was
a
sentence
beyond
her
power
to
speak
i
have
bad
news
for
you
francesca
i
m
sorry
to
say
henry
announced
had
he
heard
too
henneberg
has
been
here
and
looked
at
the
picture
he
continued
seating
himself
by
her
side
and
though
he
admired
it
immensely
as
a
work
of
art
he
gave
me
a
disagreeable
surprise
by
assuring
me
that
it
s
not
a
genuine
van
der
meulen
it
s
a
splendid
copy
but
still
unfortunately
only
a
henry
paused
and
glanced
at
his
sister
to
see
how
she
had
taken
the
unwelcome
announcement
even
in
the
dim
light
he
caught
some
of
the
anguish
in
her
eyes
my
dear
francesca
he
said
soothingly
laying
his
hand
affectionately
on
her
arm
i
know
that
this
must
be
a
great
disappointment
to
you
you
ve
always
set
such
store
by
this
picture
but
you
mustn
t
take
it
too
much
to
heart
these
disagreeable
discoveries
come
at
times
to
most
picture
fanciers
and
owners
why
about
twenty
per
cent
of
the
alleged
old
masters
in
the
louvre
are
supposed
to
be
wrongly
attributed
and
there
are
heaps
of
similar
cases
in
this
country
lady
dovecourt
was
telling
me
the
other
day
that
they
simply
daren
t
have
an
expert
in
to
examine
the
van
dykes
at
columbey
for
fear
of
unwelcome
disclosures
and
besides
your
picture
is
such
an
excellent
copy
that
it
s
by
no
means
without
a
value
of
its
own
you
must
get
over
the
disappointment
you
naturally
feel
and
take
a
philosophical
view
of
the
matter
francesca
sat
in
stricken
silence
crushing
the
folded
morsel
of
paper
tightly
in
her
hand
and
wondering
if
the
thin
cheerful
voice
with
its
pitiless
ghastly
mockery
of
consolation
would
never
stop
