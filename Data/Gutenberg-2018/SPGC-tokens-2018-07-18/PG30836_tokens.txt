chapter
i
weep
no
more
my
lady
a
young
woman
was
crying
bitterly
in
the
of
the
railway
station
at
upper
asquewan
falls
new
york
a
beautiful
young
woman
that
is
exactly
what
billy
magee
wanted
to
know
as
closing
the
door
behind
him
he
stood
staring
just
inside
were
the
features
against
which
that
frail
bit
of
cambric
was
agonizingly
pressed
of
a
pleasing
contour
the
girl
neatly
tailored
corduroy
suit
and
her
flippant
but
charming
millinery
augured
well
should
he
step
gallantly
forward
and
inquire
in
sympathetic
tones
as
to
the
cause
of
her
woe
should
he
carry
chivalry
even
to
the
lengths
of
upper
asquewan
falls
no
magee
decided
he
would
not
the
train
that
had
just
roared
away
into
the
dusk
had
not
brought
him
from
the
region
of
skyscrapers
and
derby
hats
for
deeds
of
knight
errantry
up
state
anyhow
the
tears
were
none
of
his
business
a
railway
station
was
a
natural
place
for
grief
a
field
of
many
partings
upon
whose
floor
fell
often
in
torrents
the
tears
of
those
left
behind
a
friend
mayhap
a
lover
had
been
whisked
off
into
the
night
by
the
relentless
five
local
why
not
a
lover
surely
about
such
a
dainty
trim
figure
as
this
courtiers
hovered
as
moths
about
a
flame
upon
a
tender
intimate
sorrow
it
was
not
the
place
of
an
unknown
magee
to
intrude
he
put
his
hand
gently
upon
the
latch
of
the
door
and
yet
dim
and
heartless
and
cold
was
the
interior
of
that
no
place
surely
for
a
gentleman
to
leave
a
lady
sorrowful
particularly
when
the
lady
was
so
alluring
oh
beyond
question
she
was
most
alluring
magee
stepped
softly
to
the
ticket
window
and
made
inquiry
of
the
man
inside
what
she
crying
about
he
asked
a
thin
sallow
face
on
the
forehead
of
which
a
mop
of
hair
lay
listlessly
was
pressed
against
the
bars
thanks
said
the
ticket
agent
i
get
asked
the
same
old
questions
so
often
one
like
yours
sort
of
breaks
the
monotony
sorry
i
ca
help
you
she
a
woman
and
the
lord
only
knows
why
women
cry
and
sometimes
i
reckon
even
he
must
be
a
little
puzzled
now
my
wife
i
think
i
ask
her
confided
magee
in
a
hoarse
whisper
oh
i
would
advised
the
man
behind
the
bars
it
best
to
let
alone
they
stop
quicker
if
they
ai
noticed
but
she
in
trouble
argued
billy
magee
and
so
you
be
most
likely
responded
the
cynic
if
you
interfere
no
siree
take
my
advice
shoot
old
asquewan
rapids
in
a
barrel
if
you
want
to
but
keep
away
from
crying
women
the
heedless
billy
magee
however
was
already
moving
across
the
unscrubbed
floor
with
chivalrous
intention
the
girl
trim
shoulders
no
longer
heaved
so
unhappily
magee
approaching
thought
himself
again
in
the
college
yard
at
dusk
with
the
great
elms
sighing
overhead
and
the
fresh
young
voices
of
the
glee
club
ringing
out
from
the
steps
of
a
building
what
were
the
words
they
sang
so
many
times
weep
no
more
my
lady
oh
weep
no
more
he
regretted
that
he
could
not
make
use
of
them
they
had
always
seemed
to
him
so
sad
and
beautiful
but
troubadours
he
knew
went
out
of
fashion
long
before
railway
stations
came
in
so
his
remark
to
the
young
woman
was
not
at
all
melodious
can
i
do
anything
a
portion
of
the
handkerchief
was
removed
and
an
eye
which
magee
noted
was
of
an
admirable
blue
peeped
out
at
him
to
the
gaze
of
even
a
solitary
eye
magee
aspect
was
decidedly
pleasing
young
williams
who
posed
at
the
club
as
a
wit
had
once
said
that
billy
magee
came
as
near
to
being
a
magazine
artist
idea
of
the
proper
hero
of
a
story
as
any
man
could
and
at
the
same
time
retain
the
respect
and
affection
of
his
fellows
magee
thought
he
read
approval
in
the
lone
eye
of
blue
when
the
lady
spoke
however
he
hastily
revised
his
opinion
yes
she
said
you
can
do
something
you
can
go
away
far
far
away
magee
stiffened
thus
chivalry
fared
in
upper
asquewan
falls
in
the
year
i
beg
your
pardon
he
remarked
you
seemed
to
be
in
trouble
and
i
thought
i
might
possibly
be
of
some
assistance
the
girl
removed
the
entire
handkerchief
the
other
eye
proved
to
be
the
same
admirable
blue
a
blue
between
the
shade
of
her
corduroy
suit
and
that
of
the
jacky
costume
in
the
see
the
world
join
the
navy
poster
that
served
as
background
to
her
woe
i
do
mean
to
be
rude
she
explained
more
gently
but
i
crying
you
see
and
a
girl
simply
ca
look
attractive
when
she
cries
if
i
had
only
been
regularly
introduced
to
you
and
all
that
responded
magee
i
could
make
a
very
flattering
reply
and
a
true
one
he
added
to
himself
for
even
in
the
faint
flickering
light
of
the
station
he
found
ample
reason
for
rejoicing
that
the
bit
of
cambric
was
no
longer
agonizingly
pressed
as
yet
he
had
scarcely
looked
away
from
her
eyes
but
he
was
dimly
aware
that
up
above
wisps
of
golden
hair
peeped
impudently
from
beneath
a
saucy
black
hat
he
would
look
at
those
wisps
shortly
he
told
himself
as
soon
as
he
could
look
away
from
the
eyes
which
was
not
just
yet
my
grief
said
the
girl
is
utterly
silly
and
womanish
i
think
it
would
be
best
to
leave
me
alone
with
it
thank
you
for
your
interest
and
would
you
mind
asking
the
gentleman
who
is
pressing
his
face
so
feverishly
against
the
bars
to
kindly
close
his
window
certainly
replied
magee
he
turned
away
as
he
did
so
he
collided
with
a
rather
excessive
lady
she
gave
the
impression
of
solidity
and
bulk
her
mouth
was
hard
and
knowing
magee
felt
that
she
wanted
to
vote
and
that
she
would
say
as
much
from
time
to
time
the
lady
had
a
glittering
eye
she
put
it
to
its
use
and
fixed
magee
with
it
i
was
crying
mamma
the
girl
explained
and
this
gentleman
inquired
if
he
could
be
of
any
service
mamma
magee
wanted
to
add
his
tears
to
those
of
the
girl
this
frail
and
lovely
damsel
in
distress
owning
as
her
maternal
parent
a
heavy
unnecessary
person
the
older
woman
also
had
yellow
hair
but
it
was
the
sort
that
suggests
the
white
enamel
pallor
of
a
drug
store
with
the
fizzing
and
the
bottles
of
perfume
ranged
in
an
odorous
row
mamma
thus
rolled
the
world
along
well
they
ai
no
use
gettin
all
worked
up
for
nothing
advised
the
unpleasant
parent
magee
was
surprised
that
in
her
tone
there
was
no
hostility
to
him
thus
belying
her
looks
mebbe
the
gentleman
can
direct
us
to
a
good
hotel
she
added
with
a
rather
stagy
smile
i
a
stranger
here
too
magee
replied
i
interview
the
man
over
there
in
the
cage
the
gentleman
referred
to
was
not
cheerful
in
his
replies
there
was
he
said
baldpate
inn
oh
yes
baldpate
inn
repeated
billy
magee
with
interest
yes
that
a
pretty
swell
place
said
the
ticket
agent
but
it
open
now
it
a
summer
resort
there
ai
no
place
open
now
but
the
commercial
house
and
i
would
recommend
no
human
being
there
especially
no
lady
who
was
sad
before
she
ever
saw
it
magee
explained
to
the
incongruous
family
pair
waiting
on
the
bench
there
only
one
hotel
he
said
and
i
told
it
not
exactly
the
place
for
any
one
whose
outlook
on
life
is
not
rosy
at
the
moment
sorry
it
will
do
very
well
answered
the
girl
whatever
it
is
she
smiled
at
billy
magee
my
outlook
on
life
in
upper
asquewan
falls
she
said
grows
rosier
every
minute
we
must
find
a
cab
she
began
to
gather
up
her
and
magee
hastened
to
assist
the
three
went
out
on
the
station
platform
upon
which
lay
a
thin
carpet
of
snowflakes
there
the
older
woman
in
a
harsh
rasping
voice
found
fault
with
upper
asquewan
falls
its
geography
its
public
spirit
its
brand
of
weather
a
dejected
cab
at
the
end
of
the
platform
stood
mourning
its
lonely
lot
in
it
magee
placed
the
large
lady
and
the
bags
then
while
the
driver
climbed
to
his
seat
he
spoke
into
the
invisible
ear
of
the
girl
you
have
told
me
why
you
cried
he
reminded
her
she
waved
her
hand
toward
the
wayside
village
the
lamps
of
which
shone
sorrowfully
through
the
snow
upper
asquewan
falls
she
said
is
it
reason
enough
billy
magee
looked
saw
a
row
of
gloomy
buildings
that
seemed
to
list
as
the
wind
blew
a
blurred
sign
liquors
and
cigars
a
street
that
staggered
away
into
the
dark
like
a
man
who
had
lingered
too
long
at
the
emporium
back
of
the
sign
are
you
doomed
to
stay
here
long
he
asked
come
on
mary
cried
a
deep
voice
from
the
cab
get
in
and
shut
the
door
i
freezing
it
all
depends
said
the
girl
thank
you
for
being
so
kind
and
good
night
the
door
closed
with
a
muffled
bang
the
cab
creaked
wearily
away
and
magee
turned
back
to
the
dim
well
what
was
she
crying
for
inquired
the
ticket
agent
when
magee
stood
again
at
his
cell
window
she
did
think
much
of
your
town
responded
magee
she
intimated
that
it
made
her
heavy
of
heart
h
it
ai
much
of
a
place
admitted
the
man
though
it
ai
the
general
rule
with
visitors
to
burst
into
tears
at
sight
of
it
yes
upper
asquewan
is
slow
and
no
mistake
it
gets
on
my
nerves
sometimes
nothing
to
do
but
work
work
work
and
then
lay
down
and
wait
for
i
used
to
think
maybe
some
day
they
transfer
me
down
to
hooperstown
there
moving
pictures
and
such
down
there
but
the
railroad
never
notices
you
unless
you
go
wrong
yes
sir
sometimes
i
want
to
clear
out
of
this
town
myself
a
natural
wanderlust
sympathized
magee
you
said
something
just
now
about
baldpate
inn
yes
it
a
little
more
lively
in
summer
when
that
open
answered
the
agent
we
get
a
lot
of
complaints
about
trunks
not
coming
from
pretty
swell
people
too
it
sort
of
cheers
things
his
eye
roamed
with
interest
over
magee
new
york
attire
but
baldpate
inn
is
shut
up
tight
now
this
is
nothing
but
an
annex
to
a
graveyard
in
winter
you
was
thinking
of
stopping
off
here
was
you
well
i
want
to
see
a
man
named
elijah
quimby
magee
replied
do
you
know
him
of
course
said
the
yearner
for
pastures
new
he
caretaker
of
the
inn
his
house
is
about
a
mile
out
on
the
old
miller
road
that
leads
up
baldpate
come
outside
and
i
tell
you
how
to
get
there
the
two
men
went
out
into
the
whirling
snow
and
the
agent
waved
a
hand
indefinitely
up
at
the
night
if
it
was
clear
he
said
you
could
see
baldpate
mountain
over
yonder
looking
down
on
the
falls
sort
of
keeping
an
eye
on
us
to
make
sure
we
do
get
reckless
and
up
you
see
baldpate
inn
black
and
peaceful
and
just
follow
this
street
to
the
third
corner
and
turn
to
your
left
elijah
lives
in
a
little
house
back
among
the
trees
a
mile
out
there
a
gate
you
sure
hear
creaking
on
a
night
like
this
billy
magee
thanked
him
and
gathering
up
his
two
bags
walked
up
main
street
a
dreary
forbidding
building
at
the
first
corner
bore
the
sign
commercial
house
under
the
white
gaslight
in
the
office
window
three
born
pessimists
slouched
low
in
hotel
chairs
gazing
sourly
out
at
the
storm
weep
no
more
my
lady
oh
weep
no
more
hummed
magee
cynically
under
his
breath
and
glanced
up
at
the
solitary
window
that
gleamed
yellow
in
the
night
at
a
corner
on
which
stood
a
little
shop
that
advertised
groceries
and
provisions
he
paused
let
me
see
he
pondered
the
lights
will
be
turned
off
of
course
candles
and
a
little
something
for
the
inner
man
in
case
it
the
closed
season
for
cooks
he
went
inside
where
a
weary
old
woman
served
him
what
sort
of
candles
she
inquired
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
an
infinite
variety
in
stock
magee
remembered
that
christmas
was
near
for
a
christmas
tree
he
explained
he
asked
for
two
hundred
i
only
got
forty
the
woman
said
what
this
tree
for
the
orphans
home
with
the
added
burden
of
a
package
containing
his
purchases
in
the
tiny
store
magee
emerged
and
continued
his
journey
through
the
stinging
snow
upper
asquewan
falls
on
its
way
home
for
supper
flitted
past
him
in
the
silvery
darkness
he
saw
in
the
lighted
windows
of
many
of
the
houses
the
green
wreath
of
christmas
cheer
finally
the
houses
became
infrequent
and
he
struck
out
on
an
uneven
road
that
wound
upward
once
he
heard
a
dog
faint
bark
then
a
carriage
lurched
by
him
and
a
strong
voice
cursed
the
roughness
of
the
road
magee
half
smiled
to
himself
as
he
strode
on
don
quixote
my
boy
he
muttered
i
know
how
you
felt
when
you
moved
on
the
windmills
it
was
not
the
whir
of
windmills
but
the
creak
of
a
gate
in
the
storm
that
brought
magee
at
last
to
a
stop
he
walked
gladly
up
the
path
to
elijah
quimby
door
in
answer
to
billy
magee
gay
knock
a
man
of
about
sixty
years
appeared
evidently
he
had
just
finished
supper
at
the
moment
he
was
engaged
in
lighting
his
pipe
he
admitted
magee
into
the
intimacy
of
the
kitchen
and
took
a
number
of
calm
judicious
puffs
on
the
pipe
before
speaking
to
his
visitor
in
that
interval
the
visitor
cheerily
seized
his
hand
oblivious
of
the
warm
burnt
match
that
was
in
it
the
match
fell
to
the
floor
whereupon
the
older
man
cast
an
anxious
glance
at
a
woman
who
stood
beside
the
kitchen
stove
my
name
magee
blithely
explained
that
gentleman
dragging
in
his
bags
and
you
elijah
quimby
of
course
how
are
you
glad
to
see
you
his
air
was
that
of
one
who
had
known
this
quimby
intimately
in
many
odd
corners
of
the
world
the
older
man
did
not
reply
but
regarded
magee
wonderingly
through
white
puffs
of
smoke
his
face
was
kindly
gentle
ineffectual
he
seemed
to
lack
the
final
punch
that
send
men
over
the
line
to
success
this
was
evident
in
the
way
his
necktie
hung
the
way
his
thin
hands
fluttered
yes
he
admitted
at
last
yes
i
quimby
magee
threw
back
his
coat
and
sprayed
with
snow
immaculate
floor
i
magee
he
elucidated
again
william
hallowell
magee
the
man
hal
bentley
wrote
to
you
about
you
got
his
letter
did
you
quimby
removed
his
pipe
and
forgot
to
close
the
aperture
as
he
stared
in
amazement
good
lord
he
cried
you
do
mean
you
really
come
what
better
proof
could
you
ask
said
magee
flippantly
than
my
presence
here
why
stammered
quimby
we
we
thought
it
was
all
a
joke
hal
bentley
has
his
humorous
moments
agreed
magee
but
it
his
habit
to
fling
his
jests
into
upper
asquewan
falls
and
and
you
really
going
to
quimby
could
get
no
further
yes
said
magee
brightly
slipping
into
a
yes
going
to
spend
the
next
few
months
at
baldpate
inn
quimby
who
seemed
to
have
settled
into
a
stout
little
mound
of
a
woman
through
standing
too
long
in
the
warm
presence
of
her
stove
came
forward
and
inspected
magee
of
all
things
she
murmured
it
closed
expostulated
quimby
the
inn
is
closed
young
fellow
i
know
it
closed
smiled
magee
that
the
very
reason
i
going
to
honor
it
with
my
presence
i
sorry
to
take
you
out
on
a
night
like
this
but
i
have
to
ask
you
to
lead
me
up
to
baldpate
i
believe
those
were
hal
bentley
instructions
in
the
letter
quimby
towered
above
magee
a
statue
of
honest
american
manhood
he
scowled
excuse
a
plain
question
young
man
he
said
but
what
are
you
hiding
from
quimby
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
stove
paused
to
hear
the
reply
billy
magee
laughed
i
not
hiding
he
said
did
bentley
explain
well
i
try
to
though
i
not
sure
you
understand
sit
down
quimby
you
are
not
i
take
it
the
sort
of
man
to
follow
closely
the
light
and
frivolous
literature
of
the
day
what
that
inquired
quimby
you
do
read
continued
magee
the
sort
of
novels
that
are
sold
by
the
pound
in
the
department
stores
now
if
you
had
a
daughter
a
fluffy
daughter
inseparable
from
a
hammock
in
the
summer
she
could
help
me
explain
you
see
i
write
those
novels
wild
thrilling
tales
for
the
tired
business
man
tired
wife
shots
in
the
night
chases
after
fortunes
cupid
busy
with
his
arrows
all
over
the
place
it
good
fun
and
i
like
to
do
it
there
money
in
it
is
there
asked
quimby
with
a
show
of
interest
considerable
replied
magee
but
now
and
then
i
get
a
longing
to
do
something
that
will
make
the
critics
sit
up
the
real
thing
you
know
the
other
day
i
picked
up
a
newspaper
and
found
my
latest
advertised
as
best
fall
novel
magee
ever
wrote
it
got
on
my
nerves
i
felt
like
a
literary
dressmaker
and
i
could
see
my
public
laying
down
my
fall
novel
and
sighing
for
my
early
spring
styles
in
fiction
i
remembered
that
once
upon
a
time
a
critic
advised
me
to
go
away
for
ten
years
to
some
quiet
spot
and
think
i
decided
to
do
it
baldpate
inn
is
the
quiet
spot
you
do
mean
gasped
quimby
that
you
going
to
stay
there
ten
years
bless
you
no
said
magee
critics
exaggerate
two
months
will
do
they
say
i
am
a
cheap
melodramatic
ranter
they
say
i
do
go
deep
they
say
my
thinking
process
is
a
scream
i
afraid
they
right
now
i
going
to
go
up
to
baldpate
inn
and
think
i
going
to
get
away
from
melodrama
i
going
to
do
a
novel
so
fine
and
literary
that
henry
cabot
lodge
will
come
to
me
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
ask
me
to
join
his
bunch
of
immortals
i
going
to
do
all
this
up
there
at
the
inn
sitting
on
the
mountain
and
looking
down
on
this
little
old
world
as
jove
looked
down
from
olympus
i
do
know
who
you
mean
objected
quimby
he
was
a
god
the
god
of
the
men
explained
magee
picture
me
if
you
can
depressed
by
the
overwhelming
success
of
my
latest
picture
me
meeting
hal
bentley
in
a
street
club
and
asking
him
for
the
location
of
the
lonesomest
spot
on
earth
hal
thought
a
minute
got
it
he
said
lonesomest
spot
that
happened
to
date
is
a
summer
resort
in
it
makes
crusoe
island
look
like
coney
on
a
warm
sunday
afternoon
in
comparison
the
talk
flowed
on
along
with
other
things
hal
told
me
his
father
owned
baldpate
inn
and
that
you
were
an
old
friend
of
his
who
would
be
happy
for
the
entire
winter
over
the
chance
to
serve
him
he
happened
to
have
a
key
to
the
place
the
key
to
the
big
front
door
i
guess
from
the
weight
of
it
and
he
gave
it
to
me
he
also
wrote
you
to
look
after
me
so
here
i
am
quimby
ran
his
fingers
through
his
white
hair
here
i
am
repeated
billy
magee
fleeing
from
the
great
glitter
known
as
broadway
to
do
a
little
rational
thinking
in
the
solitudes
getting
late
and
i
suggest
that
we
start
for
baldpate
inn
at
once
this
ai
exactly
regular
quimby
protested
no
it
ai
what
you
might
call
a
frequent
occurrence
i
glad
to
do
anything
i
can
for
young
bentley
but
i
ca
help
wondering
what
his
father
will
say
and
there
a
lot
of
things
you
have
took
into
consideration
there
certainly
is
young
man
remarked
quimby
bustling
forward
how
are
you
going
to
keep
warm
in
that
big
barn
of
a
place
the
suites
on
the
second
floor
said
magee
are
i
hear
equipped
with
fireplaces
quimby
will
keep
me
supplied
with
fuel
from
the
forest
primeval
for
which
service
he
will
receive
twenty
dollars
a
week
and
light
asked
quimby
for
the
present
candles
i
have
forty
in
that
package
later
perhaps
you
can
find
me
an
oil
lamp
oh
everything
will
be
provided
for
well
remarked
quimby
looking
in
a
dazed
fashion
at
his
wife
i
reckon
i
have
to
talk
it
over
with
ma
the
two
retired
to
the
next
room
and
magee
fixed
his
eyes
on
a
god
bless
our
home
motto
while
he
awaited
their
return
presently
they
reappeared
was
you
thinking
of
eating
inquired
quimby
sarcastically
while
you
stayed
up
there
i
certainly
was
smiled
magee
for
the
most
part
i
will
prepare
my
own
meals
from
cans
and
er
jars
and
such
pagan
sources
but
now
and
then
you
quimby
are
going
to
send
me
something
cooked
as
no
other
woman
in
the
county
can
cook
it
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
in
my
poor
way
i
shall
try
to
repay
you
he
continued
to
smile
into
quimby
broad
cheerful
face
magee
had
the
type
of
smile
that
moves
men
to
part
with
ten
until
saturday
and
women
to
close
their
eyes
and
dream
of
sir
launcelot
quimby
could
not
long
resist
she
smiled
back
whereupon
billy
magee
sprang
to
his
feet
it
all
fixed
he
cried
we
get
on
splendidly
and
now
for
baldpate
inn
not
just
yet
said
quimby
i
ai
one
to
let
anybody
go
up
to
baldpate
inn
unfed
i
we
sort
o
responsible
for
you
while
you
up
here
you
just
set
right
down
and
i
have
your
supper
hot
and
smoking
on
the
table
in
no
time
magee
entered
into
no
dispute
on
this
point
and
for
half
an
hour
he
was
the
pleased
recipient
of
advice
philosophy
and
food
when
he
had
assured
quimby
that
he
had
eaten
enough
to
last
him
the
entire
two
months
he
intended
spending
at
the
inn
quimby
came
in
attired
in
a
huge
before
the
war
ulster
and
carrying
a
lighted
lantern
so
you
going
to
sit
up
there
and
write
things
he
commented
well
i
reckon
you
be
left
to
yourself
all
right
i
hope
so
responded
magee
i
want
to
be
so
lonesome
i
sob
myself
to
sleep
every
night
it
the
only
road
to
immortality
quimby
in
my
fortress
on
the
mountain
i
shall
expect
an
occasional
culinary
message
from
you
he
took
her
plump
hand
this
motherly
little
woman
seemed
the
last
link
binding
him
to
the
world
of
reality
smiled
quimby
be
careful
of
matches
quimby
led
the
way
with
the
lantern
and
presently
they
stepped
out
upon
the
road
the
storm
had
ceased
but
it
was
still
very
dark
far
below
in
the
valley
twinkled
the
lights
of
upper
asquewan
falls
by
the
way
quimby
remarked
magee
is
there
a
girl
in
your
town
who
has
blue
eyes
light
hair
and
the
general
air
of
a
queen
out
shopping
light
hair
repeated
quimby
there
sally
perry
she
teaches
in
the
methodist
no
said
magee
my
description
was
poor
i
afraid
this
one
i
refer
to
when
she
weeps
gives
the
general
effect
of
mist
on
the
sea
at
dawn
the
methodists
do
not
monopolize
her
i
read
books
and
i
read
newspapers
said
quimby
but
a
lot
of
your
talk
i
do
understand
the
critics
replied
billy
magee
could
explain
my
stuff
is
only
for
lead
on
mr
quimby
quimby
stood
for
a
moment
in
dazed
silence
then
he
turned
and
the
yellow
of
his
lantern
fell
on
the
dazzling
snow
ahead
together
the
two
climbed
baldpate
mountain
chapter
ii
enter
a
lovelorn
haberdasher
baldpate
inn
did
not
stand
tiptoe
on
the
misty
instead
it
clung
with
grim
determination
to
the
side
of
baldpate
about
up
much
as
a
city
man
clings
to
the
running
board
of
an
open
this
was
the
comparison
magee
made
and
even
as
he
made
it
he
knew
that
atmospheric
conditions
rendered
it
questionable
for
an
open
suggests
summer
and
the
ball
park
baldpate
inn
as
it
shouldered
darkly
into
magee
ken
suggested
winter
at
its
most
wintry
about
the
great
black
shape
that
was
the
inn
like
arms
stretched
broad
verandas
magee
remarked
upon
them
to
his
companion
those
porches
and
balconies
and
things
he
said
will
come
in
handy
in
cooling
the
fevered
brow
of
genius
there
ai
much
fever
in
this
locality
the
practical
quimby
assured
him
especially
not
in
winter
silenced
magee
followed
the
lantern
of
quimby
over
the
snow
to
the
broad
steps
and
up
to
the
great
front
door
there
magee
produced
from
beneath
his
coat
an
impressive
key
quimby
made
as
though
to
assist
but
was
waved
aside
this
is
a
ceremony
magee
told
him
some
day
sunday
newspaper
stories
will
be
written
about
it
baldpate
inn
opening
its
doors
to
the
great
american
novel
he
placed
the
key
in
the
lock
turned
it
and
the
door
swung
open
the
coldest
blast
of
air
magee
had
even
encountered
swept
out
from
the
dark
interior
he
shuddered
and
wrapped
his
coat
closer
he
seemed
to
see
the
white
trail
from
dawson
city
the
sled
dogs
straggling
on
with
the
dwindling
provisions
the
fat
eskimo
guide
begging
for
by
his
side
whew
he
cried
we
discovered
another
pole
it
stale
air
remarked
quimby
you
mean
the
polar
atmosphere
replied
magee
yes
it
is
pretty
stale
jack
london
and
doctor
cook
have
worked
it
to
death
i
mean
said
quimby
this
air
has
been
in
here
alone
too
long
as
stale
as
last
week
newspaper
we
could
heat
it
with
a
million
fires
we
have
to
let
in
some
warm
air
from
outside
first
warm
air
humph
remarked
magee
well
live
and
learn
the
two
stood
together
in
a
great
bare
room
the
rugs
had
been
removed
and
such
furniture
as
remained
had
huddled
together
as
if
for
warmth
in
the
center
of
the
floor
when
they
stepped
forward
the
sound
of
their
shoes
on
the
hard
wood
seemed
the
boom
that
should
wake
the
dead
this
is
the
hotel
office
explained
quimby
at
the
left
of
the
door
was
the
clerk
desk
behind
it
loomed
a
great
safe
and
a
series
of
for
the
mail
of
the
guests
opposite
the
front
door
a
wide
stairway
led
to
a
landing
up
where
the
stairs
were
divorced
and
went
to
the
right
and
left
in
search
of
the
floor
above
magee
surveyed
the
stairway
critically
a
great
place
he
remarked
to
show
off
the
talents
of
your
dressmaker
eh
quimby
ca
you
just
see
the
stunning
gowns
coming
down
that
stair
in
state
and
the
young
men
below
here
agitated
in
their
bosoms
no
i
ca
said
quimby
frankly
i
ca
either
to
tell
the
truth
laughed
billy
magee
he
turned
up
his
collar
it
like
picturing
a
summer
girl
sitting
on
an
iceberg
and
swinging
her
hosiery
over
the
edge
i
do
suppose
necessary
to
register
i
go
right
up
and
select
my
apartments
it
was
upon
a
suite
of
rooms
that
bore
the
number
seven
on
their
door
that
magee
choice
fell
a
large
parlor
with
a
fireplace
that
a
few
blazing
logs
would
cheer
a
bedroom
whose
bed
was
destitute
of
all
save
mattress
and
springs
and
a
bathroom
comprised
his
kingdom
here
too
all
the
furniture
was
piled
in
the
center
of
the
rooms
after
quimby
had
opened
the
windows
he
began
straightening
the
furniture
about
magee
inspected
his
apartment
the
windows
were
all
of
the
low
french
variety
and
opened
out
upon
a
broad
balcony
which
was
in
reality
the
roof
of
the
first
floor
veranda
on
this
balcony
magee
stood
a
moment
watching
the
trees
on
baldpate
wave
their
black
arms
in
the
wind
and
the
lights
of
upper
asquewan
falls
wink
knowingly
up
at
him
then
he
came
inside
and
his
investigations
brought
him
presently
to
the
tub
in
the
bathroom
fine
he
cried
a
cold
plunge
in
the
morning
before
the
daily
struggle
for
immortality
begins
he
turned
the
spigot
nothing
happened
i
reckon
drawled
quimby
from
the
bedroom
you
carry
your
cold
plunge
up
from
the
well
back
of
the
inn
before
you
plunge
into
it
the
water
turned
off
we
ca
take
chances
with
busted
pipes
of
course
replied
magee
less
blithely
his
ardor
was
somewhat
dampened
a
paradox
by
the
failure
of
the
spigot
to
gush
forth
a
response
there
nothing
i
enjoy
more
than
carrying
eight
pails
of
water
every
morning
to
get
up
an
appetite
for
what
oh
well
the
lord
will
provide
if
we
propose
to
heat
up
the
great
american
outdoors
quimby
i
think
it
time
we
had
a
fire
quimby
went
out
without
comment
and
left
magee
to
light
his
first
candle
in
the
dark
for
a
time
he
occupied
himself
with
lighting
a
few
of
the
forty
and
distributing
them
about
the
room
soon
quimby
came
back
with
kindling
and
logs
and
subsequently
a
noisy
fire
roared
in
the
grate
again
quimby
retired
and
returned
with
a
generous
armful
of
bedding
which
he
threw
upon
the
brass
bed
in
the
inner
room
then
he
slowly
closed
and
locked
the
windows
after
which
he
came
and
looked
down
with
contempt
at
magee
who
sat
in
a
chair
before
the
fire
i
would
wander
round
none
he
advised
you
might
fall
down
something
or
something
i
been
living
in
these
parts
off
and
on
for
sixty
years
and
more
and
nothing
like
this
ever
came
under
my
observation
before
howsomever
i
guess
it
all
right
if
bentley
says
so
i
come
up
in
the
morning
and
see
you
down
to
the
train
what
train
inquired
magee
your
train
back
to
new
york
city
replied
quimby
do
try
to
start
back
in
the
night
there
ai
no
train
till
morning
ah
quimby
laughed
magee
you
taunt
me
you
think
i
wo
stick
it
out
but
i
show
you
i
tell
you
i
hungry
for
solitude
that
all
right
quimby
responded
you
ca
make
three
square
meals
a
day
off
solitude
i
desperate
said
magee
henry
cabot
lodge
must
come
to
me
i
say
with
tears
in
his
eyes
ever
see
the
senator
that
way
no
it
going
to
be
an
easy
job
i
must
put
it
over
i
must
go
deep
into
the
hearts
of
men
up
here
and
write
what
i
find
no
more
shots
in
the
night
just
the
adventure
of
soul
and
soul
do
you
see
by
the
way
here
twenty
dollars
your
first
week
pay
as
caretaker
of
a
new
york
quixote
what
that
asked
quimby
quixote
explained
magee
was
a
spanish
lad
who
was
a
little
confused
in
his
mind
and
went
about
the
country
putting
up
at
summer
resorts
in
i
expect
it
of
a
spaniard
quimby
said
be
careful
of
that
fire
i
be
up
in
the
morning
he
stowed
away
the
bill
magee
had
given
him
i
guess
nothing
will
interfere
with
your
lonesomeness
leastways
i
hope
it
wo
good
night
magee
bade
the
man
good
night
and
listened
to
the
thump
of
his
boots
and
the
closing
of
the
great
front
door
from
his
windows
he
watched
the
caretaker
move
down
the
road
without
looking
back
to
disappear
at
last
in
the
white
night
throwing
off
his
great
coat
magee
noisily
attacked
the
fire
the
blaze
flared
red
on
his
strong
humorous
mouth
in
his
smiling
eyes
next
in
the
flickering
of
suite
seven
he
distributed
the
contents
of
his
about
on
the
table
he
placed
a
number
of
new
magazines
and
a
few
books
then
magee
sat
down
in
the
big
leather
chair
before
the
fire
and
caught
his
breath
here
he
was
at
last
the
wild
plan
he
and
hal
bentley
had
cooked
up
in
that
street
club
had
actually
come
to
be
seclusion
magee
had
cried
bermuda
bentley
had
suggested
a
mixture
of
sea
hotel
clerks
and
honeymooners
the
seeker
for
solitude
had
sneered
some
winter
place
down
south
from
bentley
and
a
flirtation
lurking
in
every
corner
from
magee
a
country
town
where
you
do
know
any
one
the
easiest
place
in
the
world
to
get
acquainted
i
must
be
alone
man
alone
baldpate
inn
bentley
had
cried
in
his
idiom
why
billy
baldpate
inn
at
christmas
it
must
be
old
john
seclusion
himself
yes
here
he
was
and
here
was
the
solitude
he
had
come
to
find
magee
looked
nervously
about
and
the
smile
died
out
of
his
gray
eyes
for
the
first
time
misgivings
smote
him
might
one
not
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
a
silence
like
that
of
the
tomb
had
descended
he
recalled
stories
of
men
who
went
mad
from
loneliness
what
place
lonelier
than
this
the
wind
howled
along
the
balcony
it
rattled
the
windows
outside
his
door
lay
a
great
black
cave
in
summer
gay
with
men
and
maids
now
like
crusoe
island
before
the
old
man
landed
alone
alone
all
all
alone
quoted
magee
if
i
ca
think
here
it
will
be
because
i
not
equipped
with
the
apparatus
i
will
show
the
gloomy
old
critics
i
wonder
what
doing
in
new
york
new
york
magee
looked
at
his
watch
eight
the
great
street
was
ablaze
the
crowds
were
parading
from
the
restaurants
to
the
theaters
the
electric
signs
were
pasting
lurid
legends
on
a
long
suffering
sky
the
taxis
were
spraying
throats
with
gasoline
the
traffic
cop
at
broadway
and
street
was
madly
earning
his
pay
magee
got
up
and
walked
the
floor
new
york
probably
the
telephone
in
his
rooms
was
jangling
vainly
calling
forth
to
sport
with
amaryllis
in
the
shade
of
the
rubber
trees
billy
magee
billy
magee
who
sat
alone
in
the
silence
on
baldpate
mountain
few
knew
of
his
departure
this
was
the
night
of
that
stupid
attempt
at
theatricals
at
the
plaza
stupid
in
itself
but
gay
almost
giddy
since
helen
faulkner
was
to
be
there
this
was
the
night
of
the
dinner
to
carey
at
the
club
this
was
the
night
of
many
diverting
things
magee
picked
up
a
magazine
he
wondered
how
they
read
in
the
old
days
by
candlelight
he
wondered
if
they
would
have
found
his
own
stories
worth
the
strain
on
the
eyes
and
he
also
wondered
if
absolute
solitude
was
quite
the
thing
necessary
to
the
composition
of
the
novel
that
should
forever
silence
those
who
sneered
at
his
ability
absolute
solitude
only
the
crackle
of
the
fire
the
roar
of
the
wind
and
the
ticking
of
his
watch
bore
him
company
he
strode
to
the
window
and
looked
down
at
the
few
dim
lights
that
proclaimed
the
existence
of
upper
asquewan
falls
somewhere
down
there
was
the
commercial
house
somewhere
the
girl
who
had
wept
so
bitterly
in
that
gloomy
little
she
was
only
three
miles
away
and
the
thought
cheered
magee
after
all
he
was
not
on
a
desert
island
and
yet
he
was
alone
intensely
almost
painfully
alone
alone
in
a
vast
moaning
house
that
must
be
his
only
home
until
he
could
go
back
to
the
gay
city
with
his
masterpiece
what
a
masterpiece
as
though
with
a
surgeon
knife
it
would
lay
bare
the
hearts
of
men
no
tricks
of
plot
no
magee
paused
for
sharply
in
the
silence
the
bell
of
his
room
telephone
rang
out
he
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
in
wonder
his
heart
beating
swiftly
his
eyes
upon
the
instrument
on
the
wall
it
was
a
house
phone
he
knew
that
it
could
only
be
rung
from
the
switchboard
in
the
hall
below
i
going
mad
already
he
remarked
and
took
down
the
receiver
a
blur
of
talk
an
electric
muttering
a
click
and
all
was
still
magee
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
shadows
he
heard
a
voice
below
noiselessly
he
crept
to
the
landing
and
gazed
down
into
the
office
a
young
man
sat
at
the
telephone
switchboard
magee
could
see
in
the
dim
light
of
a
solitary
candle
that
he
was
a
person
of
rather
hilarious
raiment
the
candle
stood
on
the
top
of
the
safe
and
the
door
of
the
latter
swung
open
sinking
down
on
the
steps
in
the
dark
magee
waited
hello
the
young
man
was
saying
how
do
you
work
this
thing
anyhow
i
tried
every
peg
but
the
right
one
hello
hello
i
want
long
distance
reuton
west
andy
rutter
will
you
get
him
for
me
sister
another
wait
a
long
one
ensued
the
candle
sputtered
the
young
man
fidgeted
in
his
chair
at
last
he
spoke
again
hello
andy
is
that
you
andy
what
the
good
word
as
quiet
as
the
tomb
of
napoleon
shall
i
close
up
shop
sure
what
next
oh
see
here
andy
i
die
up
here
did
you
ever
hit
a
place
like
this
in
winter
i
ca
i
oh
well
if
he
says
so
yes
i
could
do
that
but
no
longer
i
could
stand
it
long
tell
him
that
tell
him
everything
yes
all
right
well
good
night
andy
he
turned
away
from
the
switchboard
and
as
he
did
so
magee
walked
calmly
down
the
stairs
toward
him
with
a
cry
the
young
man
ran
to
the
safe
threw
a
package
inside
and
swung
shut
the
door
he
turned
the
knob
of
the
safe
several
times
then
he
faced
magee
the
latter
saw
something
glitter
in
his
hand
good
evening
remarked
magee
pleasantly
what
are
you
doing
here
cried
the
youth
wildly
i
live
here
magee
assured
him
wo
you
come
up
to
my
room
it
right
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
i
have
a
fire
you
know
back
into
the
young
man
lean
face
crept
the
assurance
that
belonged
with
the
gay
attire
he
wore
he
dropped
the
revolver
into
his
pocket
and
smiled
a
sneering
smile
you
gave
me
a
turn
he
said
of
course
you
live
here
are
any
of
the
other
guests
about
and
who
won
the
tennis
match
you
are
facetious
magee
smiled
too
so
much
the
better
a
lively
companion
is
the
very
sort
i
should
have
ordered
come
the
young
man
looked
suspiciously
about
his
thin
nose
seemingly
scenting
plots
he
nodded
and
picked
up
the
candle
all
right
he
said
but
i
have
to
ask
you
to
go
first
you
know
the
way
his
right
hand
sought
the
pocket
into
which
the
revolver
had
fallen
you
honor
my
poor
and
drafty
house
said
magee
this
way
he
mounted
the
stairs
after
him
followed
the
youth
of
flashy
habiliments
looking
fearfully
about
him
as
he
went
he
seemed
surprised
that
they
came
to
magee
room
without
incident
inside
magee
drew
up
an
easy
chair
before
the
fire
and
offered
his
guest
a
cigar
you
must
be
cold
he
said
sit
here
bad
night
stranger
as
they
remark
in
stories
you
said
it
replied
the
young
man
accepting
the
cigar
thanks
he
walked
to
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
and
opened
it
about
a
foot
i
afraid
he
explained
jocosely
we
get
to
talking
and
miss
the
breakfast
bell
he
dropped
into
the
chair
and
lighted
his
cigar
at
a
candle
end
say
you
never
can
tell
can
you
climbing
up
old
baldpate
i
thought
to
myself
that
hotel
certainly
makes
the
sahara
desert
look
like
a
cozy
corner
and
here
you
are
as
snug
and
comfortable
and
at
home
as
if
you
were
in
a
harlem
flat
you
never
can
tell
and
what
now
the
story
of
my
life
you
might
relate
magee
told
him
that
portion
of
it
that
has
led
you
trespassing
on
a
gentleman
seeking
seclusion
at
baldpate
inn
the
stranger
looked
at
magee
he
had
an
eye
that
not
only
looked
but
weighed
estimated
and
classified
magee
met
it
smilingly
trespassing
eh
said
the
young
man
far
be
it
from
me
to
quarrel
with
a
man
who
smokes
as
good
cigars
as
you
do
but
there
something
i
have
quite
doped
out
that
is
who
trespassing
me
or
you
my
right
here
said
magee
is
indisputable
it
a
big
word
replied
the
other
but
you
can
tack
it
to
my
right
here
and
tell
no
lie
we
ca
dispute
so
let
drop
the
matter
with
that
settled
i
encouraged
to
pour
out
the
story
of
why
you
see
me
here
far
from
the
madding
crowd
have
you
a
stray
tear
need
it
it
a
sad
touching
story
concerned
with
haberdashery
and
a
trusting
heart
and
a
fair
woman
fair
but
oh
how
false
proceed
laughed
magee
i
an
admirer
of
the
vivid
imagination
do
curb
yours
i
beg
of
you
it
all
straight
said
the
other
in
a
hurt
tone
every
word
true
my
name
is
joseph
bland
my
profession
until
love
entered
my
life
was
that
of
haberdasher
and
outfitter
in
the
city
of
reuton
fifty
miles
from
here
i
taught
the
beau
brummels
of
the
thoroughfares
what
was
doing
in
london
in
the
necktie
line
i
sold
them
coats
with
padded
shoulders
and
collars
high
and
awe
inspiring
i
was
happy
twisting
a
piece
of
silk
over
my
hand
to
show
them
how
it
would
look
on
their
heaving
bosoms
and
then
she
came
mr
bland
puffed
on
his
cigar
yes
he
said
arabella
sparkled
on
the
horizon
of
my
life
when
i
have
been
here
in
the
quiet
for
about
two
centuries
maybe
i
can
do
justice
to
her
beauty
i
wo
attempt
to
describe
her
now
i
loved
her
madly
she
said
i
made
a
hit
with
her
i
spent
on
her
the
profits
of
my
haberdashery
i
whispered
marriage
she
did
scream
i
had
my
wedding
necktie
picked
out
from
the
samples
of
a
drummer
from
troy
he
paused
and
looked
at
magee
have
you
ever
stood
poised
on
that
brink
he
asked
never
replied
magee
but
go
on
your
story
attracts
me
strangely
from
here
on
the
tear
i
spoke
of
please
there
flashed
on
the
scene
a
man
she
had
known
and
loved
in
jersey
city
i
said
flashed
he
did
just
that
a
swell
dresser
say
he
had
john
drew
beat
by
two
mauve
neckties
and
a
purple
frock
coat
i
had
a
haberdashery
back
of
me
no
use
he
me
i
saw
that
arabella
love
for
me
was
waning
with
his
hands
that
new
guy
fanned
the
ancient
flame
he
paused
emotion
or
the
smoke
of
the
cigar
choked
him
let
make
the
short
story
shorter
he
said
she
threw
me
down
in
my
haberdashery
i
thought
it
over
i
was
blue
bitter
i
resolved
on
a
dreadful
step
in
the
night
i
wrote
her
a
letter
and
carried
it
down
to
the
box
and
posted
it
life
without
arabella
said
the
letter
was
shakespeare
with
hamlet
left
out
it
hinted
at
the
river
carbolic
acid
revolvers
yes
i
posted
it
and
then
and
then
urged
magee
mr
bland
felt
tenderly
of
the
horseshoe
pin
in
his
purple
tie
this
is
just
between
us
he
said
at
that
point
the
trouble
began
it
came
from
my
being
naturally
a
very
brave
man
i
could
have
died
easy
the
brave
thing
was
to
live
to
go
on
day
after
day
devoid
of
arabella
say
that
took
courage
i
wanted
to
try
it
i
a
courageous
man
as
i
say
you
seem
so
magee
agreed
assented
mr
bland
i
determined
to
show
my
nerve
and
live
but
there
was
my
letter
to
arabella
i
feared
she
appreciate
my
bravery
women
are
dull
sometimes
it
came
to
me
maybe
she
would
be
hurt
if
i
did
keep
my
word
and
die
so
i
had
to
disappear
i
had
a
friend
mixed
up
in
affairs
at
baldpate
no
i
ca
give
his
name
i
told
him
my
story
he
was
impressed
by
my
spirit
as
you
have
been
he
gave
me
a
key
he
had
the
key
of
the
door
opening
from
the
east
veranda
into
the
so
i
came
up
here
i
came
here
to
be
alone
to
forgive
and
forget
to
be
forgot
and
maybe
to
plan
a
new
haberdashery
in
distant
parts
was
it
your
wedding
necktie
asked
magee
that
you
threw
into
the
safe
when
you
saw
me
coming
no
replied
mr
bland
sighing
deeply
a
package
of
letters
written
to
me
by
arabella
at
various
times
i
want
to
forget
if
i
kept
them
on
hand
i
might
look
at
them
from
time
to
time
my
great
courage
might
give
way
you
might
find
my
body
on
the
stairs
that
why
i
hid
them
magee
laughed
and
stretched
forth
his
hand
believe
me
he
said
your
touching
confidence
in
me
will
not
be
betrayed
i
congratulate
you
on
your
narrative
power
you
want
my
story
why
am
i
here
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
worthy
to
follow
yours
but
it
has
its
good
points
as
i
have
thought
it
out
he
went
over
to
the
table
and
picked
up
a
popular
novel
upon
which
his
gaze
had
rested
while
the
haberdasher
spun
his
fabric
of
love
and
gloom
on
the
cover
was
a
picture
of
a
very
dashing
maiden
do
you
see
that
girl
he
asked
she
is
beautiful
is
she
not
even
arabella
in
her
most
splendid
moments
could
get
a
few
points
from
her
i
fancy
perhaps
you
are
not
familiar
with
the
important
part
such
a
picture
plays
in
the
success
of
a
novel
the
truth
is
however
that
the
noble
art
of
fiction
writing
has
come
to
lean
more
and
more
heavily
on
its
illustrators
the
mere
words
that
go
with
the
pictures
grow
less
important
every
day
there
are
dozens
of
distinguished
novelists
in
the
country
at
this
moment
who
might
be
haberdashers
if
it
were
for
the
long
lean
haughty
ladies
who
are
scattered
tastefully
through
their
works
mr
bland
stirred
uneasily
i
can
see
you
are
at
a
loss
to
know
what
my
search
for
seclusion
and
privacy
has
to
do
with
all
this
continued
magee
i
am
an
artist
for
years
i
have
drawn
these
lovely
ladies
who
make
fiction
salable
to
the
masses
many
a
novelist
owes
his
and
his
country
house
to
my
brush
two
months
ago
i
determined
to
give
up
illustration
forever
and
devote
my
time
to
painting
i
turned
my
back
on
the
novelists
can
you
imagine
what
happened
my
imagination
a
little
tired
apologized
mr
bland
never
mind
i
tell
you
the
leading
authors
whose
work
i
had
so
long
illustrated
saw
ruin
staring
them
in
the
face
they
came
to
me
on
their
knees
figuratively
they
begged
they
pleaded
they
hid
in
the
vestibule
of
my
flat
i
should
say
my
studio
they
even
came
up
in
my
having
bribed
the
janitor
they
would
take
no
for
an
answer
in
order
to
escape
them
and
their
really
pitiful
pleadings
i
had
to
flee
i
happened
to
have
a
friend
involved
in
the
management
of
baldpate
inn
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
give
his
name
he
gave
me
a
key
so
here
i
am
i
rely
on
you
to
keep
my
secret
if
you
perceive
a
novelist
in
the
distance
lose
no
time
in
warning
me
magee
paused
chuckling
inwardly
he
stood
looking
down
at
the
lovelorn
haberdasher
the
latter
got
to
his
feet
and
solemnly
took
magee
hand
i
i
oh
well
you
got
me
beat
a
mile
old
man
he
said
you
do
mean
to
say
began
the
hurt
magee
oh
that
all
right
mr
bland
assured
him
i
believe
every
word
of
it
it
all
as
real
as
the
haberdashery
to
me
i
keep
my
eye
peeled
for
novelists
what
gets
me
is
when
you
boil
our
two
stories
down
i
come
here
to
be
alone
you
want
to
be
alone
we
be
alone
here
together
one
of
us
must
clear
out
nonsense
answered
billy
magee
i
be
glad
to
have
you
here
stay
as
long
as
you
like
the
haberdasher
looked
magee
fully
in
the
eye
and
the
latter
was
startled
by
the
hostility
he
saw
in
the
other
face
the
point
is
said
mr
bland
i
do
want
you
here
why
maybe
because
you
recall
beautiful
dames
on
book
covers
and
in
that
way
arabella
maybe
but
what
the
use
i
put
it
simply
i
got
to
be
alone
alone
on
baldpate
mountain
i
wo
put
you
out
see
here
my
friend
cried
magee
your
grief
has
turned
your
head
you
wo
put
me
out
or
i
here
to
stay
you
welcome
to
do
the
same
if
you
like
but
you
stay
with
me
i
know
you
are
a
man
of
courage
but
it
would
take
at
least
ten
men
of
courage
to
put
me
out
of
baldpate
inn
they
stood
eying
each
other
for
a
moment
bland
thin
lips
twisted
into
a
sneer
we
see
he
said
we
settle
all
that
in
the
morning
his
tone
took
on
a
more
friendly
aspect
i
going
to
pick
out
a
downy
couch
in
one
of
these
rooms
he
said
and
lay
me
down
to
sleep
say
i
could
greet
a
blanket
like
a
friend
magee
proffered
some
of
the
covers
that
quimby
had
given
him
and
accompanied
mr
bland
to
suite
ten
across
the
hall
he
explained
the
matter
of
stale
air
and
assisted
in
the
opening
of
windows
the
conversation
was
mostly
facetious
and
mr
bland
last
remark
concerned
the
fickleness
of
woman
with
a
brisk
good
night
magee
returned
to
number
seven
but
he
made
no
move
toward
the
chilly
brass
bed
in
the
inner
room
instead
he
sat
a
long
time
by
the
fire
he
reflected
on
the
events
of
his
first
few
hours
in
that
supposedly
uninhabited
solitude
where
he
was
to
be
alone
with
his
thoughts
he
pondered
the
way
and
manner
of
the
flippant
young
man
who
posed
as
a
lovelorn
haberdasher
and
under
whose
flippancy
there
was
certainly
an
air
of
hostility
who
was
andy
rutter
down
in
reuton
what
did
the
young
man
mean
when
he
asked
if
he
should
close
up
shop
who
was
the
he
from
whom
came
the
orders
and
most
important
of
all
what
was
in
the
package
now
resting
in
the
great
safe
magee
smiled
was
this
the
stuff
of
which
solitude
was
made
he
recalled
the
ludicrous
literary
tale
he
had
invented
to
balance
the
moving
fiction
of
arabella
and
his
smile
grew
broader
his
imagination
at
least
was
in
a
healthy
state
he
looked
at
his
watch
a
quarter
of
twelve
probably
they
were
having
supper
at
the
plaza
now
and
helen
faulkner
was
listening
to
the
banalities
of
young
williams
he
settled
in
his
seat
to
think
of
miss
faulkner
he
thought
of
her
for
ten
seconds
then
stepped
to
the
window
the
moon
had
risen
and
the
snowy
roofs
of
upper
asquewan
falls
sparkled
in
the
of
the
heavens
under
one
of
those
roofs
was
the
girl
of
the
station
weeping
no
more
he
hoped
certainly
she
had
eyes
that
held
even
the
least
susceptible
to
which
class
magee
prided
himself
he
belonged
he
wished
he
might
see
her
again
might
talk
to
her
without
interruption
from
that
impossible
mamma
magee
turned
back
into
the
room
his
fire
was
but
red
glowing
ashes
he
threw
off
his
and
began
to
unlace
his
shoes
there
been
too
much
crude
melodrama
in
my
novels
he
reflected
it
so
easy
to
write
but
i
going
to
get
away
from
all
that
up
here
i
going
magee
paused
with
one
shoe
poised
in
his
hand
for
from
below
came
the
sharp
crack
of
a
pistol
followed
by
the
crash
of
breaking
glass
chapter
iii
blondes
and
suffragettes
magee
slipped
into
his
dressing
gown
seized
a
candle
and
like
the
boy
in
the
nursery
rhyme
with
one
shoe
off
and
one
shoe
on
ran
into
the
hall
all
was
silent
and
dark
below
he
descended
to
the
landing
and
stood
there
holding
the
candle
high
above
his
head
it
threw
a
dim
light
as
far
as
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
but
quickly
lost
the
battle
with
the
shadows
that
lay
beyond
hello
the
voice
of
bland
the
haberdasher
came
out
of
the
blackness
the
goddess
of
liberty
as
i
live
what
your
next
imitation
there
seems
to
be
something
doing
said
magee
mr
bland
came
into
the
light
partially
disrobed
his
revolver
in
his
hand
somebody
trying
to
get
in
by
the
front
door
he
explained
i
shot
at
him
to
scare
him
away
probably
one
of
your
novelists
or
arabella
remarked
magee
coming
down
no
answered
bland
i
distinctly
saw
a
derby
hat
with
magee
descended
the
yellow
candlelight
and
brushing
aside
the
shadows
of
the
hotel
office
it
revealed
a
mattress
lying
on
the
floor
close
to
the
clerk
desk
behind
which
stood
the
safe
on
the
mattress
was
the
bedding
magee
had
presented
to
the
haberdasher
hastily
thrown
back
by
the
lovelorn
one
on
rising
you
prefer
to
sleep
down
here
magee
commented
near
the
letters
of
arabella
yes
replied
bland
his
keen
eyes
met
magee
there
was
a
challenge
in
them
magee
turned
and
the
yellow
light
of
the
candle
flickered
wanly
over
the
great
front
door
even
as
he
looked
at
it
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
a
queer
figure
of
a
man
stood
framed
against
a
background
of
glittering
snow
mr
bland
arm
flew
up
do
shoot
cried
magee
no
please
do
urged
the
man
in
the
doorway
a
beard
a
pair
of
round
owlish
spectacles
and
two
ridiculous
left
only
a
suggestion
of
face
here
and
there
he
closed
the
door
and
stepped
into
the
room
i
have
every
right
here
i
assure
you
even
though
my
arrival
is
somewhat
unconventional
see
i
have
the
key
he
held
up
a
large
brass
key
that
was
the
counterpart
of
the
one
hal
bentley
had
bestowed
upon
magee
in
that
club
on
street
keys
to
burn
muttered
mr
bland
sourly
i
bear
no
ill
will
with
regard
to
the
shooting
went
on
the
newcomer
he
took
off
his
derby
hat
and
ruefully
regarded
a
hole
through
the
crown
his
bald
head
seemed
singularly
frank
and
naked
above
a
face
of
so
many
disguises
it
is
only
natural
that
men
alone
on
a
mountain
should
defend
themselves
from
invaders
at
two
in
the
morning
my
escape
was
narrow
but
there
is
no
ill
will
he
blinked
about
him
his
breath
a
white
cloud
in
the
cold
room
life
young
gentlemen
he
remarked
setting
down
his
bag
and
leaning
a
green
umbrella
against
it
has
its
surprises
even
at
last
night
i
was
ensconced
by
my
own
library
fire
preparing
a
paper
on
the
pagan
renaissance
i
am
on
baldpate
mountain
with
a
perforation
in
my
hat
mr
bland
shivered
i
going
back
to
bed
he
said
in
disgust
first
went
on
the
gentleman
with
the
perforated
derby
permit
me
to
introduce
myself
i
am
professor
thaddeus
bolton
and
i
hold
the
chair
of
comparative
literature
in
a
big
eastern
university
magee
took
the
mittened
hand
of
the
professor
glad
to
see
you
i
sure
he
said
my
name
is
magee
this
is
mr
bland
he
is
impetuous
but
estimable
i
trust
you
will
forgive
his
first
salute
what
a
bullet
among
gentlemen
it
seems
to
me
that
as
explanations
may
be
lengthy
and
this
room
is
very
cold
we
would
do
well
to
go
up
to
my
room
where
there
is
a
fire
delighted
cried
the
old
man
a
fire
i
long
to
see
one
let
us
go
to
your
room
by
all
means
mr
bland
sulkily
stalked
to
his
mattress
and
secured
a
gaily
colored
bed
quilt
which
he
wound
about
his
thin
form
this
is
positively
the
last
experience
meeting
i
attend
he
growled
they
ascended
to
number
seven
magee
piled
fresh
logs
on
the
fire
mr
bland
saw
to
it
that
the
door
was
not
tightly
closed
the
professor
removed
along
with
other
impedimenta
his
ear
tabs
which
were
connected
by
a
rubber
cord
he
waved
them
like
frisky
detached
ears
before
him
an
old
man
weakness
he
remarked
foolish
they
may
seem
to
you
but
i
assure
you
i
found
them
useful
companions
in
climbing
baldpate
mountain
at
this
hour
he
sat
down
in
the
largest
chair
suite
seven
owned
and
from
its
depths
smiled
benignly
at
the
two
young
men
but
i
am
not
here
to
apologize
for
my
apparel
am
i
hardly
you
are
saying
to
yourselves
is
he
here
yes
that
is
the
question
that
disturbs
you
what
has
brought
this
domesticated
college
professor
scampering
from
the
pagan
renaissance
to
baldpate
inn
for
answer
i
must
ask
you
to
go
back
with
me
a
week
time
and
gaze
at
a
picture
from
the
rather
dreary
academic
kaleidoscope
that
is
my
life
i
am
seated
back
of
a
desk
on
a
platform
in
a
bare
yellow
room
in
front
of
me
tier
on
tier
sit
a
hundred
young
men
in
various
attitudes
of
inattention
i
am
trying
to
tell
them
something
of
the
ideal
poetry
that
marked
the
rebirth
of
the
saxon
genius
they
are
bored
i
well
gentlemen
in
confidence
even
the
mind
of
a
college
professor
has
been
known
to
wander
at
times
from
the
subject
in
hand
and
then
i
begin
to
read
a
poem
a
poem
descriptive
of
a
woman
dead
six
hundred
years
and
more
ah
gentlemen
he
sat
erect
on
the
edge
of
his
great
chair
back
of
the
thick
lenses
of
his
spectacles
he
had
eyes
that
still
could
flash
this
is
not
an
era
of
romance
he
said
our
people
grub
in
the
dirt
for
the
dollar
their
visions
perish
their
souls
grow
stale
yet
now
and
then
at
most
inopportune
times
comes
the
flash
that
reveals
to
us
the
glories
that
might
be
a
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
caught
a
glimpse
of
perfect
happiness
while
he
was
in
the
midst
of
an
effort
to
corner
the
pickle
market
another
evolved
the
scheme
of
a
perfect
ode
to
the
essential
purity
of
woman
in
a
broadway
restaurant
so
like
lightning
across
the
blackest
sky
our
poetic
moments
come
mr
bland
wrapped
his
gay
quilt
more
securely
about
him
magee
smiled
encouragement
on
the
newest
raconteur
i
shall
be
brief
continued
professor
bolton
heaven
knows
that
pedagogic
room
was
no
place
for
visions
nor
were
those
athletic
young
men
fit
companions
for
a
soul
gone
giddy
yet
i
lost
my
head
as
i
read
on
there
returned
to
my
heart
a
glow
i
had
not
known
in
forty
years
the
bard
spoke
of
her
hair
yellow
lockes
crisped
like
golden
wyre
about
her
shoulders
weren
loosely
and
i
saw
as
in
a
dream
ahem
i
can
trust
you
gentlemen
a
girl
i
supposed
i
had
forever
forgot
in
the
mold
and
dust
of
my
later
years
i
will
not
go
further
into
the
matter
my
wife
hair
is
black
and
reading
on
but
losing
the
thread
of
the
poet
eulogy
in
the
golden
fabric
of
my
resurrected
dream
it
came
to
me
to
compare
that
maid
i
knew
in
the
long
ago
with
the
women
i
know
ah
gentlemen
lips
made
but
for
smiling
fling
weighty
arguments
on
the
unoffending
atmosphere
eyes
made
to
light
with
that
light
that
never
was
by
land
or
sea
blaze
instead
with
what
they
call
the
injustice
of
servitude
white
hands
made
to
find
their
way
to
the
hands
of
some
young
man
in
the
moonlight
carry
banners
in
the
dusty
streets
it
seemed
i
saw
the
blue
eyes
of
that
girl
of
long
ago
turned
sad
rebuking
on
her
sisters
of
as
i
finished
reading
my
heart
was
awhirl
i
said
to
the
young
men
before
me
a
woman
gentlemen
a
woman
worth
a
million
suffragettes
they
applauded
the
fire
in
me
died
down
soon
i
was
my
old
meek
academic
self
the
vision
had
left
no
trace
i
dismissed
my
class
and
went
home
i
found
that
my
wife
she
of
the
black
hair
had
left
my
slippers
by
the
library
fire
i
put
them
on
and
plunged
into
a
pamphlet
lately
published
by
a
distinguished
member
of
a
german
university
faculty
i
thought
the
incident
closed
forever
he
gazed
sorrowfully
at
the
two
young
men
but
gentlemen
i
had
not
counted
on
that
viper
that
we
nourish
in
our
bosom
the
american
newspaper
at
present
i
will
not
take
time
to
denounce
the
press
i
am
preparing
an
article
on
the
subject
for
a
respectable
weekly
of
select
circulation
suffice
it
to
record
what
happened
the
next
day
an
evening
paper
appeared
with
a
huge
picture
of
me
on
its
front
page
and
the
hideous
statement
that
this
was
the
professor
bolton
who
had
said
that
peroxide
blonde
is
worth
a
million
suffragettes
yes
that
was
the
dreadful
version
of
my
remark
that
was
spread
broadcast
up
to
the
time
that
story
appeared
i
had
no
idea
as
to
what
sort
of
creature
the
peroxide
blonde
might
be
i
protested
of
course
i
might
as
well
have
tried
to
dam
a
tidal
wave
with
a
table
fork
the
wrath
of
the
world
swept
down
upon
me
i
was
deluged
with
telegrams
editorials
letters
denouncing
me
females
lay
in
wait
for
me
and
waved
umbrellas
in
my
eyes
even
my
wife
turned
from
me
saying
that
while
she
did
not
ask
me
to
hold
her
views
on
the
question
of
suffrage
she
thought
i
might
at
least
refrain
from
publicly
commending
a
type
of
woman
found
chiefly
in
musical
comedy
choruses
i
received
a
note
from
the
president
of
the
university
asking
me
to
be
more
circumspect
in
my
remarks
me
thadeus
bolton
the
most
conservative
man
on
earth
by
instinct
and
still
the
denunciations
of
me
poured
in
still
women
clubs
held
meetings
resolving
against
me
still
a
steady
stream
of
reporters
flowed
through
my
life
urging
me
to
state
my
views
further
to
name
the
ten
greatest
blondes
in
history
to
heaven
knows
what
yesterday
i
resolved
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
i
determined
to
go
away
until
the
whole
thing
was
forgotten
they
said
to
me
is
no
place
on
land
or
sea
where
the
reporters
will
not
find
you
i
talked
the
matter
over
with
my
old
friend
john
bentley
owner
of
baldpate
inn
and
he
in
his
kindness
gave
me
the
key
to
this
hostelry
the
old
man
paused
and
passed
a
silk
handkerchief
over
his
bald
head
that
sirs
he
said
is
my
story
that
is
why
you
see
me
on
baldpate
mountain
this
chill
december
morning
that
is
why
loneliness
can
have
no
terrors
exile
no
sorrows
for
me
that
is
why
i
bravely
faced
your
again
let
me
repeat
i
bear
no
malice
on
that
score
you
have
ruined
a
new
derby
hat
and
the
honorarium
of
professor
even
at
a
leading
university
is
not
such
as
to
permit
of
many
purchases
in
that
line
but
i
forgive
you
freely
even
at
the
cannon
mouth
i
would
have
fled
from
reputation
to
paraphrase
the
poet
wisely
professor
bolton
blinked
about
him
mr
bland
was
half
asleep
in
his
chair
but
magee
was
quick
with
sympathy
professor
he
said
you
are
a
much
suffering
man
i
feel
for
you
here
i
am
sure
you
are
safe
from
reporters
and
the
yellow
journals
will
soon
forget
you
in
their
discovery
of
the
next
distorted
wonder
briefly
mr
bland
and
myself
will
outline
the
tangle
of
events
that
brought
us
to
the
inn
briefly
is
right
broke
in
bland
and
then
it
me
for
that
mountainous
mattress
of
mine
i
can
rattle
my
story
off
in
short
order
and
give
you
the
fine
points
up
to
a
short
time
ago
but
billy
magee
interrupted
an
idea
magnificent
delicious
mirthful
had
come
to
him
why
not
he
chuckled
inwardly
but
his
face
was
most
serious
i
should
like
to
tell
my
story
first
if
you
please
he
said
the
haberdasher
grunted
the
professor
nodded
magee
looked
bland
squarely
in
the
eye
strangled
the
laugh
inside
him
and
began
up
to
a
short
time
ago
i
was
a
haberdasher
in
the
city
of
reuton
my
name
let
me
state
is
magee
william
magee
i
fitted
the
gay
of
reuton
with
clothing
from
the
back
pages
of
the
magazines
and
as
for
neckties
mr
bland
sly
eyes
had
opened
wide
he
rose
to
a
majestic
height
majestic
considering
the
bed
quilt
see
here
he
began
please
do
interrupt
requested
magee
sweetly
i
was
as
i
have
said
a
happy
carefree
haberdasher
and
then
she
entered
my
life
arabella
was
her
name
ah
professor
you
lady
of
the
yellow
locks
crisped
liken
golden
wire
even
she
must
never
in
my
presence
be
compared
with
arabella
she
she
had
a
face
noah
webster
have
found
words
to
describe
it
and
her
heart
was
true
to
yours
truly
at
least
i
thought
that
it
was
magee
rattled
on
the
haberdasher
his
calling
and
his
tragedy
snatched
from
him
by
the
humorous
magee
retired
with
sullen
face
into
his
bed
quilt
carefully
magee
led
up
to
the
coming
of
the
man
from
jersey
city
in
detail
he
laid
bare
the
duel
of
haberdashery
fought
in
the
name
of
the
fair
arabella
as
he
proceeded
his
enthusiasm
grew
he
added
fine
bits
that
had
escaped
mr
bland
he
painted
with
free
hand
the
picture
of
tragedy
dark
hour
the
note
hinting
at
suicide
he
gave
in
full
then
he
told
of
how
his
courage
grew
again
of
how
he
put
the
cowardice
of
death
behind
him
resolved
to
dare
all
and
live
he
finished
at
last
his
voice
husky
with
emotion
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
glanced
triumphantly
at
bland
that
gentleman
was
gazing
thoughtfully
at
the
blazing
logs
you
did
quite
right
commented
professor
bolton
in
making
up
your
mind
to
live
i
congratulate
you
on
your
common
sense
and
perhaps
as
the
years
go
by
you
will
realize
that
had
you
married
your
arabella
you
would
not
have
found
life
all
honey
and
roses
she
was
fickle
unworthy
of
you
soon
you
will
forget
youth
ah
youth
throws
off
its
sorrow
like
a
cloak
a
figure
not
original
with
me
and
now
the
gentleman
in
the
er
the
bed
quilt
has
he
too
a
story
yes
laughed
magee
let
hear
now
from
the
gentleman
in
the
bed
quilt
has
he
too
a
story
and
if
so
what
is
it
he
smiled
delightedly
into
the
eyes
of
bland
what
would
the
do
shorn
of
his
fictional
explanation
would
he
rise
in
his
wrath
and
denounce
the
man
who
had
stolen
his
arabella
mr
bland
smiled
back
he
stood
up
and
a
contingency
that
had
not
entered
magee
mind
came
to
be
mr
bland
walked
calmly
to
the
table
and
picked
up
a
popular
novel
that
lay
thereon
on
its
cover
was
the
picture
of
a
very
beautiful
maiden
see
that
dame
he
inquired
of
the
professor
sort
of
makes
a
man
sit
up
and
take
notice
does
she
even
the
haberdasher
here
has
got
to
admit
that
in
some
ways
she
has
this
arabella
person
looking
like
a
faded
chromo
in
your
grandmother
parlor
on
a
rainy
afternoon
ever
get
any
notion
professor
the
way
a
picture
like
that
boosts
a
novel
in
the
busy
marts
of
trade
no
well
mr
bland
continued
magee
leaned
back
overjoyed
in
his
chair
here
was
a
man
not
to
be
annoyed
by
the
mere
filching
of
his
story
here
was
a
man
with
a
sense
of
humor
an
opponent
worthy
his
foe
best
efforts
in
his
rôle
of
a
haberdasher
overcome
with
woe
magee
listened
i
used
to
paint
dames
like
that
bland
was
saying
to
the
dazed
professor
he
explained
how
his
pictures
had
enabled
many
a
novelist
to
eat
up
the
highway
in
a
as
he
approached
the
time
when
the
novelists
besieged
him
he
gave
full
play
to
his
imagination
one
he
said
sought
out
his
apartments
in
an
aeroplane
say
professor
he
finished
we
in
the
same
boat
both
hiding
from
writers
a
fellow
that
spent
his
life
selling
neckties
well
he
exactly
appreciate
our
situation
there
what
you
might
call
a
bond
between
you
and
me
d
know
i
felt
drawn
to
you
just
after
i
fired
that
first
shot
that
why
i
did
blaze
away
again
we
going
to
be
great
friends
i
can
read
it
in
the
stars
he
took
the
older
man
hand
feelingly
shook
it
and
walked
away
casting
a
covert
glance
of
triumph
at
magee
the
face
of
the
holder
of
the
crandall
chair
of
comparative
literature
was
a
study
he
looked
first
at
one
young
man
then
at
the
other
again
he
applied
the
handkerchief
to
his
shining
head
all
this
is
very
odd
he
said
thoughtfully
a
man
of
particularly
one
who
has
long
lived
in
the
uninspired
circle
surrounding
a
university
has
not
the
quick
wit
of
youth
i
afraid
i
do
but
no
matter
it
very
odd
though
he
permitted
magee
to
escort
him
into
the
hall
and
to
direct
his
search
for
a
bed
that
should
serve
him
through
the
scant
remainder
of
the
night
overcoats
and
rugs
were
pressed
into
service
as
cover
mr
bland
blithely
assisted
if
i
see
any
newspaper
reporters
he
assured
the
professor
on
parting
i
damage
more
than
their
derbies
thank
you
replied
the
old
man
heartily
you
are
very
kind
we
shall
become
better
acquainted
good
night
the
two
young
men
came
out
and
stood
in
the
hallway
magee
spoke
in
a
low
tone
forgive
me
he
said
for
stealing
your
arabella
take
her
and
welcome
said
bland
she
was
beginning
to
bore
me
anyhow
and
i
not
in
your
class
as
an
actor
he
came
close
to
magee
in
the
dim
light
that
streamed
out
from
number
seven
the
latter
saw
the
look
on
his
face
and
knew
that
underneath
all
this
was
a
very
much
worried
young
man
for
god
sake
cried
bland
tell
me
who
you
are
and
what
doing
here
in
three
words
tell
me
if
i
did
magee
replied
you
would
believe
me
let
such
minor
matters
as
the
truth
wait
over
till
well
anyhow
bland
said
his
foot
on
the
top
step
we
are
sure
of
one
thing
we
do
trust
each
other
i
got
one
parting
word
for
you
do
try
to
come
i
got
a
gun
and
i
afraid
to
shoot
he
paused
a
look
of
fright
passed
over
his
face
for
on
the
floor
above
they
both
heard
soft
footsteps
then
a
faint
click
as
though
a
door
had
been
gently
closed
this
inn
whispered
bland
has
more
keys
than
a
literary
club
in
a
prohibition
town
and
every
one
in
use
i
guess
remember
do
try
to
come
i
warned
you
or
arabella
romeo
may
be
found
with
a
bullet
in
him
yet
i
sha
forget
what
you
say
answered
magee
shall
we
look
about
bland
shook
his
head
no
he
said
go
in
and
go
to
bed
it
the
that
that
concerns
me
good
night
he
went
swiftly
down
the
steps
leaving
magee
staring
wonderingly
after
him
like
a
wraith
he
merged
with
the
shadows
below
magee
turned
slowly
and
entered
number
seven
a
fantastic
film
of
frost
was
on
the
windows
the
inner
room
was
drear
and
chill
partially
undressing
he
lay
down
on
the
brass
bed
and
pulled
the
covers
over
him
the
events
of
the
night
danced
in
giddy
array
before
him
as
he
closed
his
eyes
with
every
groan
baldpate
inn
uttered
in
the
wind
he
started
up
keen
for
a
new
adventure
at
length
his
mind
seemed
to
stand
still
and
there
remained
of
all
that
amazing
evening
pictures
but
one
that
of
a
girl
in
a
blue
corduroy
suit
who
wept
wept
only
that
her
smile
might
be
the
more
dazzling
when
it
flashed
behind
the
tears
with
yellow
locks
crisped
like
golden
wire
murmured
magee
and
so
he
fell
asleep
chapter
iv
a
professional
hermit
appears
every
morning
at
eight
when
slumber
chains
had
bound
magee
in
his
new
york
apartments
he
was
awakened
by
a
pompous
valet
named
geoffrey
whom
he
shared
with
the
other
young
men
in
the
building
it
was
geoffrey
custom
to
enter
raise
the
curtains
and
speak
of
the
weather
in
a
voice
vibrant
with
feeling
as
of
something
he
had
prepared
himself
and
was
anxious
to
have
magee
try
so
when
a
rattling
noise
came
to
his
ear
on
his
first
morning
at
baldpate
inn
magee
breathed
sleepily
from
the
covers
good
morning
geoffrey
but
no
cheery
voice
replied
in
terms
of
sun
wind
or
rain
surprised
magee
sat
up
in
bed
about
him
the
furniture
of
suite
seven
stood
shivering
in
the
chill
of
a
december
morning
through
the
door
at
his
left
he
caught
sight
of
a
white
tub
into
which
he
recalled
sadly
not
even
a
geoffrey
could
coax
a
glittering
drop
yes
he
was
at
baldpate
inn
he
remembered
the
climb
with
the
dazed
quimby
up
the
snowy
road
the
plaint
of
the
lovelorn
haberdasher
the
vagaries
of
the
professor
with
a
penchant
for
blondes
the
mysterious
click
of
the
on
the
floor
above
and
last
of
all
strange
that
it
should
have
been
last
a
girl
in
blue
corduroy
somewhat
darker
than
her
eyes
who
wept
amid
the
station
gloom
i
wonder
reflected
magee
staring
at
the
very
brassy
bars
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
what
new
variations
on
seclusion
the
day
will
bring
forth
again
came
the
rattling
noise
that
had
awakened
him
he
looked
toward
the
nearest
window
and
through
an
unfrosted
corner
of
the
pane
he
saw
the
eyes
of
the
newest
variation
staring
at
him
in
wonder
they
were
dark
eyes
and
kindly
they
spoke
a
desire
to
enter
rising
from
his
warm
retreat
magee
took
his
shivering
way
across
the
uncarpeted
floor
and
unfastened
the
window
catch
from
the
blustering
balcony
a
plump
little
man
stepped
inside
he
had
a
market
basket
on
his
arm
his
face
was
a
stranger
to
razors
his
hair
to
shears
he
reminded
magee
of
the
celebrated
doctor
who
came
every
year
to
the
small
town
of
his
boyhood
there
to
sell
a
wonderful
healing
herb
to
the
crowds
on
the
street
corner
magee
dived
hastily
back
under
the
covers
well
he
questioned
so
you
the
fellow
remarked
the
little
man
in
awe
he
placed
the
basket
on
the
floor
it
appeared
to
be
filled
with
bromidic
groceries
such
as
the
most
subdued
householder
carries
home
which
fellow
asked
magee
the
fellow
elijah
quimby
told
me
about
explained
he
of
the
long
brown
locks
the
fellow
that
come
up
to
baldpate
inn
to
be
alone
with
his
thoughts
you
one
of
the
villagers
i
take
it
guessed
magee
you
dead
wrong
i
no
villager
my
instincts
are
all
in
the
other
direction
away
from
the
crowd
i
live
up
near
the
top
of
baldpate
in
a
little
shack
i
built
myself
my
name
peters
jake
peters
in
the
winter
but
in
the
summer
when
the
inn
open
and
the
red
and
white
awnings
are
out
and
the
band
plays
in
the
casino
every
night
then
the
hermit
of
baldpate
mountain
i
come
down
here
and
sell
picture
of
myself
to
the
ladies
magee
appeared
overcome
with
mirth
a
professional
hermit
by
the
gods
he
cried
say
i
did
know
baldpate
mountain
was
fitted
up
with
all
the
modern
improvements
this
is
great
luck
i
an
amateur
at
the
hermit
business
you
have
to
teach
me
the
fine
points
sit
down
just
between
ourselves
i
not
a
regular
hermit
said
the
plump
bewhiskered
one
sitting
gingerly
on
the
edge
of
a
frail
chair
not
one
of
these
for
love
of
a
woman
hermits
you
read
about
in
books
of
course
i
have
to
pretend
i
am
in
summer
in
order
to
sell
the
cards
and
do
my
whole
duty
by
the
inn
management
a
lot
of
the
women
ask
me
in
soft
tones
about
the
great
disappointment
that
drove
me
to
old
baldpate
and
i
give
various
answers
according
to
how
i
feel
speaking
to
you
as
a
friend
and
considering
the
fact
that
it
the
dead
of
winter
i
may
say
there
was
little
or
no
romance
in
my
life
i
married
early
and
stayed
married
a
long
time
i
came
up
here
for
peace
and
quiet
and
because
i
felt
a
man
ought
to
read
something
besides
and
tradesmen
bills
and
have
something
over
his
head
besides
a
first
and
second
mortgage
back
to
nature
in
other
words
remarked
magee
yes
sir
back
with
a
rush
i
was
down
to
the
village
this
morning
for
a
few
groceries
and
i
stopped
off
at
quimby
as
i
often
do
he
told
me
about
you
i
help
him
a
lot
around
the
inn
and
we
arranged
i
was
to
stop
in
and
start
your
fire
and
do
any
other
little
errands
you
might
want
done
i
thought
we
ought
to
get
acquainted
you
and
me
being
as
we
both
literary
men
after
a
manner
of
speaking
no
cried
magee
yes
said
the
hermit
of
baldpate
i
dip
into
that
work
a
little
now
and
then
some
of
my
verses
on
the
joys
of
solitude
have
appeared
in
print
on
the
i
sell
to
the
guests
in
the
summer
but
my
as
you
might
call
it
is
a
book
i
had
under
way
for
some
time
it
called
simply
just
that
one
word
but
oh
the
meaning
in
it
that
book
is
going
to
prove
that
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
from
the
beginning
of
time
was
caused
by
females
not
just
say
so
mind
you
prove
it
a
difficult
task
i
afraid
smiled
magee
not
difficult
long
corrected
the
hermit
when
i
started
out
four
years
ago
i
thought
it
would
just
be
a
case
of
a
chapter
on
eve
and
honorable
mention
for
cleopatra
and
helen
of
troy
and
a
few
more
like
that
and
the
thing
would
be
done
but
as
i
got
into
the
subject
i
was
fairly
buried
under
new
evidence
then
carnegie
came
along
and
gave
upper
asquewan
falls
a
library
it
wonderful
to
think
the
great
works
that
man
will
be
responsible
for
i
dedicated
to
him
since
the
new
library
i
dug
up
information
about
a
thousand
disasters
i
never
dreamed
of
before
and
i
contend
that
if
you
go
back
a
ways
in
any
one
of
you
find
the
fluffy
little
lady
that
started
the
whole
rumpus
so
i
hunt
the
woman
i
reckon
the
french
would
call
me
the
greatest
la
in
history
a
fascinating
pursuit
laughed
magee
i
glad
you
told
me
about
it
and
i
shall
watch
the
progress
of
the
work
with
interest
although
i
ca
say
that
i
entirely
agree
with
you
here
and
there
is
a
woman
who
more
than
makes
amends
for
whatever
trouble
her
sisters
have
caused
one
for
instance
with
golden
hair
and
eyes
that
when
they
weep
you
young
interrupted
the
little
man
rising
there
ai
no
use
to
debate
it
with
you
i
might
as
well
try
to
argue
with
a
storm
at
sea
some
men
keep
the
illusion
to
the
end
of
their
days
and
i
hope
one
i
reckon
i
start
your
fire
he
went
into
the
outer
room
and
magee
lay
for
a
few
moments
listening
to
his
preparations
about
the
fireplace
this
was
comfort
he
thought
and
yet
something
was
wrong
was
it
the
growing
feeling
of
emptiness
inside
undoubtedly
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
leaning
over
gazed
into
the
hermit
basket
the
packages
he
saw
there
made
his
feeling
of
emptiness
the
more
acute
i
say
peters
he
cried
leaping
from
bed
and
running
into
the
other
room
where
the
hermit
was
persuading
a
faint
blaze
i
an
idea
you
can
cook
ca
you
cook
repeated
the
hermit
well
yes
i
had
to
learn
a
few
things
about
it
living
far
from
the
rathskellars
the
way
i
do
the
very
man
rejoiced
magee
you
must
stay
here
and
cook
for
me
for
us
us
asked
the
hermit
staring
yes
i
forgot
to
tell
you
after
quimby
left
me
last
night
two
other
amateur
hermits
hove
in
view
one
is
a
haberdasher
with
a
broken
heart
woman
cried
the
triumphant
peters
name
arabella
laughed
magee
the
other
a
college
professor
who
made
an
indiscreet
remark
about
blondes
you
wo
mind
them
i
sure
and
they
may
be
able
to
help
you
a
lot
with
your
great
work
i
do
know
what
quimby
will
say
studied
the
hermit
i
reckon
run
out
he
against
this
thing
afraid
of
fire
quimby
will
come
later
magee
assured
him
drawing
on
a
just
now
the
idea
is
a
little
water
in
yonder
tub
and
a
nice
cheerful
breakfast
after
it
going
to
pay
you
a
lot
better
than
selling
to
romantic
ladies
i
promise
you
i
wo
take
you
away
from
a
work
for
which
the
world
is
panting
without
more
than
making
it
up
to
you
financially
where
do
you
stand
as
a
coffee
maker
wait
till
you
taste
it
said
peters
reassuringly
i
bring
you
up
some
water
he
started
for
the
door
but
magee
preceded
him
the
haberdasher
he
explained
sleeps
below
and
he
a
nervous
man
he
might
commit
the
awful
error
of
shooting
the
only
cook
on
baldpate
mountain
magee
went
out
into
the
hall
and
called
from
the
depths
the
figure
of
bland
fully
attired
in
his
flashy
garments
and
looking
tawdry
and
tired
in
the
morning
light
i
been
up
hours
he
remarked
heard
somebody
knocking
round
the
kitchen
but
i
ai
seen
any
breakfast
brought
in
on
a
silver
tray
my
inside
feels
like
the
mammoth
cave
magee
introduced
the
hermit
of
baldpate
pleased
to
meet
you
said
bland
i
guess
it
was
you
i
heard
in
the
kitchen
so
you
going
to
cater
to
this
select
few
are
you
believe
me
you
ca
get
on
the
job
any
too
soon
to
suit
me
out
of
a
door
stepped
the
figure
of
professor
thaddeus
bolton
and
him
magee
included
in
the
presentation
ceremonies
after
the
hermit
had
disappeared
below
burdened
with
his
market
basket
and
the
supplies
magee
had
brought
the
night
before
the
three
amateurs
at
the
hermit
game
gathered
by
the
fire
in
number
seven
and
mr
bland
spoke
feelingly
i
do
know
where
you
plucked
that
cook
but
believe
me
you
get
a
vote
of
thanks
from
yours
truly
what
is
he
an
advertisement
for
a
hair
restorer
he
a
hermit
explained
magee
and
lives
in
a
shack
near
the
hermits
and
barbers
are
supposed
to
mix
he
also
an
author
and
is
writing
a
book
in
which
he
lays
all
the
trouble
of
the
ages
at
the
feet
of
woman
please
treat
him
with
the
respect
all
these
dignified
activities
demand
a
writer
you
say
commented
professor
bolton
let
us
hope
it
will
not
interfere
with
his
cooking
abilities
for
even
i
who
am
not
much
given
to
thought
about
material
things
must
admit
the
presence
of
a
gnawing
hunger
within
they
talked
little
being
men
unfed
while
jake
peters
started
proceedings
in
the
kitchen
and
tramped
with
many
pails
of
water
magee
requested
warm
water
for
shaving
whereupon
he
was
regarded
with
mingled
emotions
by
his
companions
you
ai
going
to
see
any
skirts
up
here
mr
bland
promised
him
and
peters
bringing
the
water
from
below
took
occasion
to
point
out
that
shaving
was
one
of
man
troubles
directly
attributable
to
presence
in
the
world
at
length
the
hermit
summoned
them
to
breakfast
and
as
they
descended
the
broad
stair
the
heavenly
odor
of
coffee
sent
a
glow
to
their
hearts
peters
had
built
a
rousing
fire
in
the
big
fireplace
opposite
the
clerk
desk
in
the
office
and
in
front
of
this
he
had
placed
a
table
which
held
promise
of
a
satisfactory
breakfast
as
the
three
sat
down
mr
bland
spoke
i
do
know
about
you
gentlemen
but
i
could
fall
on
peters
neck
and
call
him
blessed
the
gentleman
thus
referred
to
served
them
genially
he
brought
to
magee
between
whom
and
himself
he
recognized
the
tie
of
authorship
a
copy
of
a
new
york
paper
that
he
claimed
to
get
each
morning
from
the
station
agent
and
which
helped
him
greatly
he
said
in
his
eternal
search
for
the
woman
as
the
meal
passed
magee
glanced
it
through
twice
he
looked
up
from
it
to
study
keenly
his
queer
companions
at
baldpate
inn
finally
he
handed
it
across
the
table
to
the
haberdasher
the
dull
yellow
sun
of
a
winter
morning
drifted
in
from
the
white
outdoors
the
fire
sputtered
gaily
in
the
grate
also
failing
for
literature
interfered
in
no
way
with
his
talents
as
cook
the
three
finished
the
repast
in
great
good
humor
and
magee
handed
round
cigars
gentlemen
he
remarked
pushing
back
his
chair
we
find
ourselves
in
a
peculiar
position
three
lone
men
knowing
nothing
of
one
another
we
have
sought
the
solitude
of
baldpate
inn
at
almost
the
same
moment
why
last
night
before
you
came
professor
bolton
mr
bland
gave
me
as
his
reason
for
being
here
the
story
of
arabella
which
i
afterward
appropriated
as
a
joke
and
gave
as
my
own
reason
i
related
to
mr
bland
the
fiction
about
the
artist
and
the
besieging
novelists
we
swapped
stories
when
you
came
it
was
our
merry
little
method
of
doubting
each
other
word
perhaps
it
was
bad
taste
at
any
rate
looking
at
it
in
the
morning
light
i
am
inclined
to
return
mr
bland
arabella
and
no
questions
asked
he
is
again
the
lovelorn
haberdasher
i
am
inclined
to
believe
implicitly
your
story
that
is
my
proposition
no
doubts
of
one
another
we
are
here
for
whatever
reasons
we
say
we
are
the
professor
nodded
gravely
last
night
went
on
magee
there
was
some
talk
between
mr
bland
and
myself
about
one
of
us
leaving
the
inn
mr
bland
demanded
it
i
trust
he
sees
the
matter
differently
this
morning
i
for
one
should
be
sorry
to
see
him
go
i
changed
my
mind
said
mr
bland
the
look
on
his
thin
face
was
not
a
pleasant
one
very
good
went
on
magee
i
see
no
reason
why
we
should
not
proceed
on
friendly
terms
peters
has
agreed
to
cook
for
us
he
can
no
doubt
be
persuaded
to
attend
to
our
other
wants
for
his
services
we
shall
pay
him
generously
in
view
of
the
circumstances
as
for
quimby
i
leave
you
to
make
your
peace
with
him
i
have
a
letter
to
quimby
from
my
old
friend
john
bentley
said
the
professor
which
i
am
sure
will
win
me
the
caretaker
warm
regard
magee
looked
at
bland
i
get
andy
rutter
on
the
wire
said
that
gentleman
quimby
will
listen
to
him
i
guess
maybe
remarked
magee
carelessly
who
is
rutter
he
manager
of
the
inn
when
it
open
answered
bland
he
looked
suspiciously
at
magee
i
only
know
him
slightly
he
added
those
matters
you
will
arrange
for
yourselves
magee
went
on
i
shall
be
very
glad
of
your
company
if
you
can
fix
it
to
stay
believe
it
or
not
i
forgot
we
agreed
to
believe
did
we
i
am
here
to
do
some
writing
i
going
up
to
my
room
now
to
do
a
little
work
all
i
ask
of
you
gentlemen
is
that
as
a
favor
to
me
you
refrain
from
shooting
at
each
other
while
i
am
gone
you
see
i
am
trying
to
keep
crude
melodrama
out
of
my
stuff
i
am
sure
remarked
professor
bolton
that
the
use
of
firearms
as
a
means
of
social
diversion
between
mr
bland
and
myself
is
unthought
of
i
hope
so
responded
magee
there
then
the
matter
rests
we
are
here
that
is
all
he
hesitated
as
though
in
doubt
then
with
a
decisive
motion
he
drew
toward
him
the
new
york
paper
with
his
eyes
on
the
of
the
first
page
he
continued
i
shall
demand
no
further
explanations
and
except
for
this
once
i
shall
make
no
reference
to
this
story
in
the
newspaper
to
the
effect
that
early
yesterday
morning
in
a
laboratory
at
one
of
our
leading
universities
a
young
assistant
instructor
was
found
dead
under
peculiar
circumstances
he
glanced
keenly
at
the
little
man
across
from
him
nor
shall
i
make
conversation
of
the
fact
he
added
that
the
professor
of
chemistry
at
the
university
a
man
past
middle
age
respected
highly
in
the
university
circle
is
missing
an
oppressive
silence
followed
this
remark
mr
bland
sly
eyes
sought
quickly
the
professor
face
the
older
man
sat
staring
at
his
plate
then
he
raised
his
head
and
the
round
spectacles
were
turned
full
on
magee
you
are
very
kind
said
professor
bolton
evenly
there
is
another
story
in
this
paper
went
on
magee
glancing
at
the
haberdasher
that
it
seems
to
me
i
ought
to
taboo
as
table
talk
at
baldpate
inn
it
relates
that
a
few
days
ago
the
youthful
cashier
of
a
bank
in
a
small
pennsylvania
town
disappeared
with
thirty
thousand
dollars
of
the
bank
funds
no
he
concluded
we
are
simply
here
gentlemen
and
i
am
very
glad
to
let
it
go
at
that
mr
bland
sneered
knowingly
i
should
think
you
would
be
he
said
if
you
turn
that
paper
over
you
read
on
the
back
page
that
day
before
yesterday
a
lot
of
expensive
paintings
in
a
new
york
millionaire
house
were
cut
from
their
frames
and
that
the
young
artist
who
was
doing
retouching
in
the
house
at
the
time
has
been
just
careless
enough
not
to
send
his
address
to
the
police
it
a
small
matter
of
course
and
the
professor
and
i
will
never
mention
it
again
magee
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
heartily
we
understand
one
another
it
seems
he
said
i
look
forward
to
pleasant
companionship
where
i
had
expected
solitude
you
will
excuse
me
now
there
is
the
work
to
which
i
referred
ah
here
peters
he
added
as
the
hermit
entered
through
the
door
at
the
side
of
the
stairs
all
finished
gentlemen
he
asked
coming
forward
now
this
is
solid
comfort
ai
it
i
reckon
when
you
get
a
few
days
of
this
you
all
become
hermits
and
build
yourselves
shacks
on
the
mountain
solid
comfort
no
woman
to
make
you
put
on
overshoes
when
you
go
out
or
lecture
you
about
the
effects
of
alcohol
on
the
stomach
heaven
i
call
it
peters
said
magee
we
have
been
wondering
if
you
will
stay
on
here
and
cook
for
us
we
need
you
how
about
it
well
i
be
glad
to
help
you
out
the
hermit
replied
i
guess
i
can
manage
to
give
satisfaction
seeing
there
ai
no
women
around
if
there
was
i
would
think
of
it
yes
i
stay
and
do
what
i
can
to
boost
the
hermit
life
in
your
estimation
i
he
stopped
his
eyes
were
on
the
door
toward
which
magee
back
was
turned
the
jaw
of
peters
fell
and
his
mouth
stood
wide
open
behind
the
underbrush
of
beard
a
very
surprised
face
was
discernible
magee
turned
quickly
a
few
feet
inside
the
door
stood
the
girl
of
the
station
weeping
no
more
but
radiant
with
smiles
back
of
her
was
the
determined
impossible
companion
of
yesterday
oh
mamma
laughed
the
girl
we
too
late
for
breakfast
is
it
a
shame
mr
bland
lean
hands
went
quickly
to
adjust
his
purple
tie
professor
bolton
looked
every
inch
the
owl
as
he
blinked
in
dazed
fashion
at
the
blue
corduroy
vision
gingerly
peters
set
down
the
plates
he
had
taken
from
the
table
still
neglecting
his
open
mouth
magee
rose
from
the
table
and
went
forward
with
outstretched
hand
chapter
v
the
mayor
casts
a
shadow
before
from
tears
to
smiles
said
magee
taking
the
girl
hand
what
worked
the
transformation
not
the
commercial
house
i
know
for
i
passed
it
last
evening
no
hardly
the
commercial
house
laughed
the
girl
rather
the
sunshine
of
a
winter
morning
the
brisk
walk
up
the
mountain
and
the
sight
of
the
hermit
of
baldpate
with
eyes
like
saucers
staring
at
a
little
girl
who
once
bought
his
postal
cards
then
you
know
mr
peters
inquired
magee
is
that
his
name
you
see
i
never
met
him
in
private
life
he
was
just
the
hermit
when
i
knew
him
i
used
to
come
to
baldpate
in
the
summers
and
send
his
cards
back
to
the
folks
at
home
and
dream
dreams
of
his
when
from
my
window
i
saw
the
light
of
his
shack
at
night
i
so
glad
to
meet
peters
informally
she
held
out
her
hand
but
peters
by
long
practise
wary
of
women
had
burdened
himself
with
breakfast
plates
which
prevented
his
clasping
it
he
muttered
how
d
do
and
fled
toward
the
door
narrowly
averting
what
would
have
proved
a
serious
collision
with
the
large
woman
on
the
way
peters
meets
so
few
of
your
sex
in
winter
magee
apologized
you
must
pardon
his
clumsiness
this
gentleman
he
indicated
the
professor
who
arose
is
thaddeus
bolton
a
distinguished
member
of
a
certain
university
faculty
who
has
fled
to
baldpate
to
escape
the
press
of
america
and
this
is
mr
bland
who
hides
here
from
the
world
the
scars
of
a
broken
heart
but
let
us
not
go
into
details
the
girl
smiled
brightly
and
you
she
asked
william
hallowell
magee
he
returned
bowing
low
i
have
a
neat
little
collection
of
stories
accounting
for
my
presence
here
from
which
i
shall
allow
you
to
choose
later
not
to
mention
the
real
one
which
is
simple
almost
to
a
fault
i
am
so
happy
to
meet
you
all
said
the
girl
we
shall
no
doubt
become
very
good
friends
for
mamma
and
i
have
also
come
to
baldpate
inn
to
stay
mr
bland
opened
wide
his
usually
narrow
eyes
and
ran
his
hand
thoughtfully
over
his
one
day
beard
professor
bolton
blinked
his
astonishment
magee
smiled
i
for
one
am
delighted
to
hear
it
he
said
my
name
went
on
the
girl
is
mary
norton
may
i
present
my
mother
mrs
norton
the
older
woman
adopted
what
was
obviously
her
society
manner
once
again
magee
felt
a
pang
of
regret
that
this
should
be
the
parent
of
a
girl
so
charming
i
certainly
am
pleased
to
meet
you
all
she
said
in
her
heavy
voice
ai
it
a
lovely
morning
after
the
storm
the
sun
almost
blinding
some
explanation
put
in
miss
norton
quickly
is
due
you
if
i
am
to
thrust
myself
thus
upon
you
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
tell
why
i
am
here
but
the
matter
must
leak
out
i
can
trust
you
i
sure
magee
drew
up
chairs
and
the
two
women
were
seated
before
the
fire
the
bandits
of
baldpate
he
remarked
flippantly
glancing
at
the
two
men
have
their
own
code
of
honor
and
the
first
rule
is
never
to
betray
a
pal
splendid
laughed
the
girl
you
said
i
believe
that
professor
bolton
was
fleeing
from
the
newspapers
i
am
fleeing
for
the
newspapers
to
attract
their
attention
to
lure
them
into
giving
me
that
thing
so
necessary
to
a
woman
in
my
profession
publicity
you
see
i
am
an
actress
the
name
i
gave
you
is
not
my
stage
name
that
perhaps
you
would
know
i
employ
a
gentleman
to
keep
me
before
the
public
as
much
as
possible
it
horrid
i
know
but
it
means
bread
and
butter
to
me
that
gentleman
my
evolved
the
present
scheme
a
mysterious
disappearance
she
paused
and
looked
at
the
others
magee
surveyed
her
narrowly
the
youthful
bloom
of
her
cheek
carried
to
him
no
story
of
grease
paint
her
unaffected
manner
was
far
from
suggesting
anything
remotely
connected
with
the
stage
he
wondered
i
am
to
disappear
completely
for
a
time
she
went
on
though
the
earth
had
swallowed
me
will
be
the
good
old
phrase
of
the
reporters
i
am
to
linger
here
at
baldpate
inn
a
key
to
which
my
has
secured
for
me
meanwhile
the
papers
will
speak
tearfully
of
me
in
their
at
least
i
hope
they
will
ca
you
just
see
them
those
actress
drops
from
sight
she
stopped
blushing
every
woman
who
gets
into
print
you
know
is
beautiful
but
it
be
no
lie
in
your
case
dearie
put
in
norton
feeling
carefully
of
her
atrociously
blond
store
hair
your
mother
takes
the
words
from
my
mouth
smiled
magee
guard
as
they
will
against
it
the
newspapers
let
the
truth
crop
out
occasionally
and
this
will
be
such
an
occasion
from
what
part
of
ireland
do
you
come
laughed
the
girl
she
seemed
somewhat
embarrassed
by
her
mother
open
admiration
well
setting
all
blarney
aside
such
will
be
the
and
when
the
last
clue
is
exhausted
and
my
is
the
same
i
come
back
to
appear
in
a
new
play
a
actress
of
such
flippant
things
is
a
broadway
reputation
built
we
all
wish
you
success
i
sure
magee
searched
his
memory
in
vain
for
this
actress
name
and
fame
could
it
be
possible
he
wondered
at
this
late
day
that
any
one
would
try
for
publicity
by
such
an
obvious
road
hardly
the
answer
was
simple
another
fable
was
being
spun
from
whole
cloth
beneath
the
roof
of
baldpate
inn
we
have
a
new
york
paper
here
he
went
on
but
as
yet
there
seems
to
be
no
news
of
your
sad
disappearance
would
it
be
the
limit
if
they
did
fall
for
it
queried
the
older
woman
fall
for
it
repeated
professor
bolton
not
questioningly
but
with
the
air
of
a
scientist
about
to
add
a
new
and
rare
specimen
to
his
alcohol
jar
she
means
if
they
did
accept
my
disappearance
as
legitimate
news
explained
the
girl
that
would
be
very
disappointing
but
surely
there
was
no
harm
in
making
the
experiment
they
a
clever
lot
those
newspaper
guys
sneered
mr
bland
in
their
own
opinion
but
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
every
one
of
has
a
nice
little
collection
of
gold
bricks
in
his
closet
i
guess
you
got
them
going
i
hope
so
thank
you
smiled
the
girl
you
are
very
kind
you
are
here
i
understand
because
of
an
unfortunate
er
affair
of
the
heart
mr
bland
smoothed
back
his
black
oily
hair
from
his
forehead
and
smirked
oh
now
he
protested
arabella
put
in
magee
was
her
name
the
beauties
of
history
and
mythology
hobbled
into
oblivion
at
sight
of
her
i
quick
to
forget
insisted
mr
bland
that
does
you
no
credit
i
sure
replied
the
girl
severely
and
now
mamma
i
think
we
had
better
select
our
rooms
she
paused
for
elijah
quimby
had
come
in
through
the
door
and
stood
gazing
at
the
group
before
the
fire
his
face
reflecting
what
magee
the
novelist
would
not
have
hesitated
a
moment
in
terming
mingled
emotions
well
drawled
quimby
he
strode
into
the
room
magee
he
said
that
letter
from
bentley
asked
me
to
let
you
stay
at
baldpate
inn
there
was
anything
in
it
about
your
bringing
parties
of
friends
along
these
are
not
friends
i
brought
along
explained
magee
simply
some
more
amateur
hermits
who
have
strolled
in
from
time
to
time
all
have
their
individual
to
the
hermitage
and
all
i
believe
have
credentials
for
you
to
examine
quimby
stared
in
angry
wonder
is
the
world
crazy
he
demanded
any
one
think
it
was
july
the
way
people
act
the
inn
closed
i
tell
you
it
ai
running
professor
bolton
rose
from
his
chair
so
you
are
quimby
he
said
in
a
soothing
tone
i
glad
to
meet
you
at
last
my
old
friend
john
bentley
has
spoken
of
you
so
often
i
have
a
letter
from
him
he
drew
the
caretaker
to
one
side
and
took
an
envelope
from
his
pocket
the
two
conversed
in
low
tones
quickly
the
girl
in
the
corduroy
suit
leaned
toward
magee
she
whispered
and
her
tone
was
troubled
stand
by
me
i
afraid
i
need
your
help
what
the
matter
inquired
magee
i
have
much
of
any
right
here
i
guess
but
i
had
to
come
but
your
key
i
fear
my
my
stole
it
a
scornful
remark
as
to
the
antiquated
methods
of
that
mythical
publicity
promoter
rose
to
magee
lips
but
before
he
spoke
he
looked
into
her
eyes
and
the
remark
was
never
made
for
in
their
wonderful
depths
he
saw
worry
and
fear
and
unhappiness
as
he
had
seen
them
there
amid
tears
in
the
station
never
mind
he
said
very
gently
i
see
you
through
quimby
was
standing
over
mr
bland
how
about
you
he
asked
call
up
andy
rutter
and
ask
about
me
replied
bland
in
the
tone
of
one
who
prefers
war
to
peace
i
work
for
bentley
said
quimby
rutter
has
any
authority
here
he
is
to
be
manager
next
season
i
understand
however
the
professor
wants
me
to
let
you
stay
he
says
he
be
responsible
mr
bland
looked
in
astonishment
at
the
unexpected
sponsor
he
had
found
and
you
went
on
quimby
to
the
women
why
began
miss
norton
absolutely
all
right
said
magee
they
come
from
hal
bentley
like
myself
he
put
them
in
my
care
i
answer
for
them
he
saw
the
girl
eyes
they
spoke
her
thanks
quimby
shook
his
head
as
one
in
a
dream
all
this
is
beyond
me
way
beyond
he
ruminated
nothing
like
it
ever
happened
before
that
i
heard
of
i
going
to
write
all
about
it
to
bentley
and
i
suppose
i
got
to
let
you
stay
till
i
hear
from
him
i
think
he
ought
to
come
up
here
if
he
can
the
more
the
merrier
said
magee
reflecting
cheerfully
that
the
bentleys
were
in
florida
at
last
accounts
come
mamma
said
miss
norton
rising
let
go
up
and
pick
out
a
suite
there
one
i
used
to
have
a
few
years
ago
you
can
see
the
hermit
shack
from
the
windows
by
the
way
magee
will
you
send
peters
up
to
us
he
may
be
able
to
help
us
get
settled
ahem
muttered
magee
i
i
have
a
talk
with
peters
to
be
quite
frank
i
anticipate
trouble
you
see
the
hermit
of
baldpate
does
approve
of
women
do
approve
of
women
cried
norton
her
green
eyes
flashing
why
not
i
like
to
know
my
dear
madam
responded
magee
only
echo
answers
and
it
but
vacuously
repeats
not
that
however
is
the
situation
peters
loathes
the
sex
i
imagine
that
until
he
was
not
particularly
happy
in
the
examples
of
it
he
encountered
why
he
has
even
gone
so
far
as
to
undertake
a
book
attributing
all
the
trouble
of
the
world
to
woman
the
idiot
cried
norton
delicious
laughed
the
girl
i
shall
ask
peters
to
serve
you
said
magee
i
shall
appeal
to
his
gallant
side
but
i
must
proceed
gently
this
is
his
first
day
as
our
cook
and
you
know
how
necessary
a
good
first
impression
is
with
a
new
cook
i
appeal
to
his
better
nature
do
do
it
cried
the
girl
do
emphasize
us
to
him
in
any
way
or
he
may
exercise
his
right
as
cook
and
leave
just
ignore
us
we
play
at
being
our
own
ignore
you
cried
magee
what
herculean
tasks
you
set
i
not
equal
to
that
one
he
picked
up
their
and
led
the
way
i
something
of
a
myself
when
roused
he
said
the
girl
selected
suite
seventeen
at
the
farther
end
of
the
corridor
from
magee
apartments
it
the
very
one
i
used
to
have
years
and
years
ago
at
least
two
or
three
years
ago
she
said
is
it
stupid
all
the
furniture
in
a
heap
and
cold
said
norton
my
land
i
wish
i
was
back
by
my
own
fire
i
make
you
regret
your
words
norton
cried
magee
he
threw
up
the
windows
pulled
off
his
coat
and
set
to
work
on
the
furniture
the
girl
bustled
about
lightening
his
work
by
her
smile
norton
managed
to
get
consistently
in
the
way
when
he
had
the
furniture
distributed
he
procured
logs
and
tried
his
hand
at
a
fire
then
he
stood
his
black
hair
disheveled
his
hands
soiled
but
his
heart
very
gay
before
the
girl
of
the
station
i
hope
you
do
expect
a
tip
she
said
laughing
i
do
he
said
coming
closer
and
speaking
in
a
voice
that
was
not
for
the
ear
of
the
chaperon
i
want
a
tip
on
this
do
you
really
act
she
looked
at
him
steadily
once
she
said
when
i
was
sixteen
i
appeared
in
an
amateur
play
at
school
it
was
my
first
and
last
appearance
on
the
stage
thanks
lady
remarked
magee
in
imitation
of
the
he
was
supposed
to
be
he
sought
number
seven
there
he
made
himself
again
presentable
after
which
he
descended
to
the
office
mr
bland
sat
reading
the
new
york
paper
before
the
fire
from
the
little
and
the
parlor
the
two
rooms
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
hotel
front
door
quimby
had
brought
forth
extra
chairs
he
stood
now
by
the
large
chair
that
held
professor
bolton
engaged
in
conversation
with
that
gentleman
yes
he
was
saying
i
lived
three
years
in
reuton
and
five
years
in
new
york
it
took
me
eight
years
eight
years
to
realize
the
truth
i
heard
about
it
from
john
bentley
the
professor
said
gently
he
been
pretty
kind
to
me
bentley
has
replied
quimby
when
the
money
was
all
gone
he
offered
me
this
job
once
the
quimbys
owned
most
of
the
land
around
baldpate
mountain
it
all
went
in
those
eight
years
to
think
that
it
took
all
those
years
for
me
to
find
it
out
if
i
not
impertinent
quimby
put
in
magee
to
find
what
out
that
what
i
wanted
the
railroad
men
did
want
replied
quimby
bitterly
and
that
was
the
safety
of
the
public
you
see
i
invented
a
new
rail
joint
one
that
was
a
great
improvement
on
the
old
kind
i
had
sort
of
an
idea
when
i
was
doing
it
an
idea
of
service
to
the
world
you
know
god
what
a
joke
i
sold
all
the
quimby
lands
and
went
to
reuton
and
then
to
new
york
to
place
it
not
one
of
the
railroad
men
but
admitted
that
it
was
an
improvement
and
a
big
one
and
not
one
but
fought
like
mad
to
keep
me
from
getting
it
down
where
the
public
would
see
it
they
did
want
the
expense
of
a
change
quimby
looked
out
at
the
sunlit
stretch
of
snow
eight
years
he
repeated
i
fought
and
pleaded
no
i
begged
that
was
the
word
i
begged
you
be
surprised
to
know
the
names
of
some
of
the
men
who
kept
me
waiting
in
their
private
offices
and
sneered
at
me
over
their
polished
desks
they
turned
me
down
every
one
some
of
them
played
me
as
though
i
been
a
fish
they
referred
me
to
other
ends
of
the
same
big
game
laughing
in
their
sleeves
i
guess
at
the
knowledge
of
how
hopeless
it
was
oh
they
made
a
fine
fool
of
me
you
might
have
put
down
some
of
your
joints
at
your
own
expense
suggested
the
professor
did
i
try
cried
quimby
do
you
think
they
let
me
no
the
public
might
see
them
and
demand
them
everywhere
once
i
thought
i
had
convinced
somebody
it
was
down
in
reuton
the
suburban
railway
there
was
a
rustle
as
mr
bland
let
his
paper
fall
to
the
floor
old
henry
thornhill
was
president
of
the
road
he
is
yet
i
guess
but
young
hayden
and
a
fellow
named
david
kendrick
were
running
it
kendrick
was
on
my
side
he
almost
had
hayden
they
were
going
to
let
me
lay
a
stretch
of
track
with
my
joints
then
something
happened
maybe
you
remember
kendrick
disappeared
in
the
night
he
never
been
seen
since
i
do
remember
said
the
professor
softly
hayden
turned
me
down
went
on
quimby
the
money
was
all
gone
so
i
came
back
to
upper
asquewan
caretaker
of
an
inn
that
overlooks
the
property
my
father
owned
the
property
i
squandered
for
a
chance
to
save
human
lives
it
all
like
a
dream
now
those
eight
years
and
it
nearly
drives
me
mad
sometimes
to
think
that
it
took
me
eight
years
eight
years
to
find
it
out
i
just
straighten
things
around
a
bit
he
moved
away
and
the
men
sat
in
silence
for
a
time
then
the
professor
spoke
very
gently
poor
devil
to
have
had
his
dream
of
service
and
then
grow
old
on
baldpate
the
two
joined
mr
bland
by
the
fire
magee
had
put
from
his
mind
all
intention
of
work
the
maze
of
events
through
which
he
wandered
held
him
bewildered
and
enthralled
he
looked
at
the
haberdasher
and
the
university
scholar
and
asked
himself
if
they
were
real
or
if
he
was
still
asleep
in
a
room
on
a
side
street
in
new
york
waiting
for
the
cheery
coming
of
geoffrey
he
asked
himself
still
more
perplexedly
if
the
creature
that
came
toward
him
now
through
the
door
was
real
the
hairy
hermit
of
baldpate
like
a
figure
out
of
some
old
print
his
market
basket
on
his
arm
again
his
coat
buttoned
to
the
chin
well
everything
shipshape
in
the
kitchen
announced
the
hermit
cheerfully
i
could
go
without
seeing
to
that
i
wish
you
the
best
of
luck
gentlemen
and
cried
the
professor
by
the
gods
he
leaving
us
almost
wept
mr
bland
it
ca
be
said
magee
it
has
to
be
said
the
hermit
of
baldpate
solemnly
shaking
his
head
i
like
to
stay
with
you
and
i
would
of
if
they
had
come
but
here
they
are
and
when
women
come
in
the
door
i
fly
out
of
the
window
as
the
saying
is
but
peters
pleaded
magee
you
not
going
to
leave
us
in
the
hole
like
this
sorry
replied
peters
i
can
please
men
but
i
ca
please
women
i
tried
to
please
one
once
but
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
i
live
on
baldpate
in
a
shack
to
escape
the
sex
and
it
would
be
consistent
for
me
to
stay
here
now
i
got
to
go
i
hate
to
like
a
dog
but
i
got
to
peters
said
magee
i
surprised
after
giving
your
word
to
stay
and
who
knows
you
may
be
able
to
gather
valuable
data
for
your
book
stick
around
these
women
wo
bother
you
i
make
them
promise
never
to
ask
about
the
you
did
have
never
even
to
come
near
you
and
we
pay
you
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
of
a
broadway
chef
wo
we
gentlemen
the
others
nodded
peters
visibly
weakened
well
he
began
i
his
eyes
were
on
the
stair
magee
also
looked
in
that
direction
and
saw
the
girl
of
the
station
smiling
down
she
no
longer
wore
coat
and
hat
and
the
absence
of
the
latter
revealed
a
glory
of
golden
hair
that
became
instantly
a
rival
to
the
sunshine
in
that
drear
bare
room
no
peters
she
said
you
must
go
we
could
permit
it
mamma
and
i
will
go
she
continued
to
smile
at
the
obviously
dazzled
peters
suddenly
he
spoke
in
a
determined
tone
no
do
do
that
i
stay
then
he
turned
to
magee
and
continued
for
that
gentleman
ear
alone
it
we
all
alike
we
resolve
and
resolve
and
then
one
of
them
looks
at
us
and
it
all
forgot
i
had
a
friend
who
advertised
for
a
wife
leastways
he
was
a
friend
until
he
advertised
he
got
replies
seventy
of
from
married
men
advising
against
the
step
cured
he
says
to
me
for
me
did
he
keep
his
word
no
a
week
after
he
married
a
widow
just
to
see
if
what
the
seventy
said
was
true
i
mortal
i
hang
around
the
if
you
give
me
a
little
money
i
go
down
to
the
village
and
buy
the
provisions
for
lunch
gleefully
magee
started
the
hermit
on
his
way
and
then
went
over
to
where
the
girl
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
promised
him
he
told
her
you
ask
no
questions
regarding
his
broken
heart
it
seems
he
has
any
that
horrid
of
him
is
it
she
smiled
every
good
hermit
is
equipped
with
a
broken
heart
i
certainly
sha
bother
him
i
came
down
to
get
some
water
they
went
together
to
the
kitchen
found
a
pail
and
filled
it
with
icy
water
from
the
pump
at
the
rear
of
the
inn
inside
once
more
magee
remarked
thoughtfully
who
would
have
guessed
a
week
ago
that
i
would
be
climbing
the
broad
staircase
of
a
summer
hotel
carrying
a
pail
of
water
for
a
lady
fair
they
paused
on
the
landing
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
horatio
smiled
the
girl
than
are
dreamed
of
even
by
novelists
magee
started
had
she
recognized
him
as
the
magee
of
light
fiction
it
seemed
hardly
likely
they
read
his
books
but
they
rarely
remembered
his
name
her
face
went
suddenly
grave
she
came
closer
i
ca
help
wondering
she
said
which
side
you
are
on
which
side
of
what
asked
magee
why
of
this
she
answered
waving
her
hand
toward
the
office
below
i
do
understand
objected
magee
let
not
be
silly
she
replied
you
know
what
brought
me
here
i
know
what
brought
you
there
are
three
sides
and
only
one
is
honest
i
hope
so
very
much
that
you
are
on
that
side
upon
my
word
began
magee
will
it
interest
you
to
know
she
continued
i
saw
the
big
mayor
of
reuton
in
the
village
this
morning
with
him
was
his
shadow
lou
max
let
see
you
had
the
first
key
mr
bland
the
second
the
professor
the
third
and
i
had
the
fourth
the
mayor
has
the
fifth
key
of
course
he
be
here
soon
the
mayor
gasped
magee
really
i
have
the
slightest
idea
what
you
mean
i
here
to
work
very
well
said
the
girl
coldly
if
you
wish
it
that
way
they
came
to
the
door
of
seventeen
and
she
took
the
pail
from
magee
hand
thanks
are
you
going
my
pretty
maid
asked
magee
indicating
the
pail
i
see
you
at
luncheon
sir
she
said
responded
miss
norton
and
the
door
of
seventeen
slammed
shut
magee
returned
to
number
seven
and
thoughtfully
stirred
the
fire
the
tangle
of
events
bade
fair
to
swamp
him
the
mayor
of
reuton
he
mused
has
the
fifth
key
what
in
the
name
of
common
sense
is
going
on
it
too
much
even
for
melodramatic
me
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
anyhow
i
like
her
eyes
he
said
and
i
should
want
to
be
quoted
as
disapproving
of
her
hair
either
i
on
her
side
whichever
it
may
be
chapter
vi
ghosts
of
the
summer
crowd
i
wonder
miss
norton
smiled
up
into
magee
face
if
you
ever
watched
the
people
at
a
summer
hotel
get
set
on
their
mark
for
the
sprint
through
the
door
no
answered
magee
but
i
have
visited
the
zoo
at
they
tell
me
it
is
much
the
same
a
brutal
comparison
said
the
girl
but
just
the
same
i
sure
that
the
head
waiter
who
opens
the
door
here
at
baldpate
must
feel
much
the
same
at
the
moment
as
the
keeper
who
proffers
the
raw
meat
on
the
end
of
the
pitchfork
he
faces
such
a
wild
determined
mob
the
front
rank
is
made
up
of
women
worn
out
by
veranda
gossip
usually
some
stiff
old
dowager
crosses
the
tape
first
i
was
thinking
that
perhaps
we
resembled
that
crowd
in
the
eyes
of
peters
now
it
was
past
one
and
magee
with
his
four
mysterious
companions
stood
before
the
fire
in
the
office
each
with
an
eager
eye
out
for
the
progress
of
the
hermit
who
was
preparing
the
table
beside
them
through
the
kindness
of
quimby
the
board
was
resplendent
with
snowy
linen
we
may
seem
commented
professor
bolton
i
have
no
doubt
we
do
it
is
only
natural
with
nothing
to
look
forward
to
but
the
next
meal
the
human
animal
attaches
a
preposterous
importance
to
his
feeding
we
are
in
the
same
case
as
the
summer
guests
are
we
interrupted
magee
have
we
nothing
but
the
next
meal
to
look
forward
to
i
think
not
i
have
i
come
to
value
too
highly
the
capacity
for
excitement
of
baldpate
inn
in
december
i
look
forward
to
startling
things
i
expect
before
the
day
is
out
at
least
two
kings
an
exiled
poet
and
a
lord
mayor
all
armed
with
keys
to
baldpate
inn
and
stories
strange
and
unconvincing
your
adventures
of
the
last
hours
remarked
the
professor
smiling
wanly
have
led
you
to
expect
too
much
i
have
made
inquiries
of
quimby
there
are
aside
from
his
own
but
seven
keys
in
all
to
the
various
doors
of
baldpate
inn
four
are
here
represented
it
is
hardly
likely
that
the
other
three
will
send
delegates
and
if
they
should
you
have
but
a
slim
chance
for
kings
and
poets
even
baldpate
capacity
for
excitement
you
see
is
limited
by
the
number
of
little
steel
keys
which
open
its
portals
to
exiles
from
the
outside
world
i
am
reminded
of
the
words
of
the
philosopher
well
peters
old
top
broke
in
mr
bland
in
robust
tones
is
she
nearly
off
the
fire
now
see
here
said
the
hermit
setting
down
the
armful
of
dishes
with
which
he
had
entered
the
office
i
ca
be
hurried
i
all
upset
as
it
is
i
ca
cook
to
please
women
i
do
pretend
to
i
have
to
take
all
sorts
of
precautions
with
this
lunch
without
meaning
to
be
impolite
but
just
because
of
a
passion
for
cold
facts
i
may
say
that
women
are
faultfinding
i
sure
said
miss
norton
sweetly
that
i
shall
consider
your
luncheon
perfect
they
get
more
faultfinding
as
they
get
older
replied
peters
ungallantly
glancing
at
the
other
woman
norton
glared
meaning
me
i
suppose
she
rasped
well
do
worry
i
ai
going
to
find
anything
wrong
i
ai
asking
the
impossible
responded
peters
i
ai
asking
you
not
to
find
anything
wrong
i
just
asking
you
not
to
mention
it
when
you
do
he
retired
to
the
kitchen
norton
caressed
her
puffs
lovingly
what
that
man
needs
she
said
is
a
woman
guiding
hand
he
lived
alone
too
long
i
like
to
have
charge
of
him
for
a
while
not
that
i
would
be
kind
but
i
be
firm
if
poor
norton
was
alive
testify
that
i
was
always
kindness
itself
but
i
insisted
on
his
living
up
to
his
promises
when
i
was
a
girl
i
was
mighty
popular
i
had
a
lot
of
admirers
no
one
could
possibly
doubt
that
magee
assured
her
then
norton
came
along
she
went
on
rewarding
magee
with
a
smile
and
said
he
wanted
to
make
me
happy
so
i
thought
i
let
him
try
he
was
a
splendid
man
but
there
no
denying
that
in
the
years
we
were
married
he
sometimes
forgot
what
he
started
out
to
do
i
always
brought
him
up
sharp
great
desire
i
told
him
to
make
me
happy
keep
on
the
job
if
i
was
you
and
he
did
to
the
day
of
his
death
a
perfectly
lovely
man
though
careless
in
money
matters
if
he
had
had
that
failing
i
would
be
miss
norton
her
cheeks
flushed
broke
in
hurriedly
mamma
these
gentlemen
ca
be
at
all
interested
deftly
she
turned
the
conversation
to
generalities
peters
at
last
seated
the
winter
guests
of
baldpate
inn
and
opened
his
luncheon
with
a
soup
which
he
claimed
to
have
wrested
from
a
can
this
news
drew
from
professor
bolton
a
learned
discourse
on
the
tinned
aids
to
the
hermit
of
he
pictured
the
seeker
for
solitude
setting
out
for
a
desert
isle
with
canned
foods
for
his
body
and
canned
music
for
his
soul
robinson
crusoe
he
said
should
be
rewritten
with
a
in
the
leading
rôle
norton
gave
the
talk
a
more
practical
turn
by
bringing
up
the
topic
of
ptomaine
poisoning
while
the
conversation
drifted
on
magee
pondered
in
silence
the
weird
mesh
in
which
he
had
become
involved
what
did
it
all
mean
what
brought
these
people
to
baldpate
christmas
week
his
eyes
sought
the
great
safe
back
of
the
desk
and
stayed
there
a
long
time
in
that
safe
he
was
sure
lay
the
answer
to
this
preposterous
riddle
when
his
thoughts
came
back
to
the
table
he
found
mr
bland
eying
him
narrowly
there
was
a
troubled
look
on
the
haberdasher
lean
face
that
could
never
be
ascribed
to
the
cruelty
of
arabella
the
luncheon
over
miss
norton
and
her
mother
prepared
to
ascend
to
their
rooms
magee
maneuvered
so
as
to
meet
the
girl
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
wo
you
come
back
he
whispered
softly
and
explain
things
to
a
poor
hermit
who
is
completely
at
sea
what
things
she
asked
what
it
all
means
he
whispered
why
you
wept
in
the
station
why
you
invented
the
story
of
the
actress
why
you
came
here
to
brighten
my
drab
exile
what
this
whole
comedy
of
baldpate
inn
amounts
to
anyhow
i
assure
you
i
am
as
innocent
of
understanding
it
as
is
the
czar
of
russia
on
his
golden
throne
she
only
looked
at
him
with
unbelieving
eyes
you
can
hardly
expect
me
to
credit
that
she
said
i
must
go
up
now
and
read
mamma
into
the
pleasant
land
of
thin
girlish
figures
that
is
her
afternoon
siesta
i
may
come
back
and
talk
to
you
after
a
while
but
i
do
promise
to
explain
come
back
pleaded
magee
that
is
all
i
ask
a
tiny
boon
she
smiled
i
grant
it
she
followed
the
generous
figure
of
the
other
woman
up
the
stair
and
casting
back
a
dazzling
smile
from
the
landing
disappeared
magee
turned
to
find
professor
bolton
discoursing
to
mr
bland
on
some
aspects
of
the
pagan
renaissance
mr
bland
face
was
pained
that
great
stuff
professor
he
said
and
usually
i
like
it
but
just
now
i
do
seem
in
the
mood
somehow
would
you
mind
saving
it
for
me
till
later
certainly
sighed
the
professor
mr
bland
slouched
into
the
depths
of
his
chair
professor
bolton
turned
his
disappointed
face
ceilingward
laughing
magee
sought
the
solitude
of
number
seven
after
all
i
here
to
work
he
told
himself
alarms
and
excursions
and
blue
eyes
must
not
turn
me
from
my
task
let
see
what
was
my
task
a
deep
novel
a
novel
devoid
of
rabid
melodrama
it
becomes
more
difficult
every
minute
here
at
baldpate
inn
but
that
should
only
add
more
zest
to
the
struggle
i
devote
the
next
two
hours
to
thought
he
pulled
his
chair
up
before
the
blazing
hearth
and
gazed
into
the
red
depths
but
his
thoughts
refused
to
turn
to
the
masterpiece
that
was
to
be
born
on
baldpate
they
roamed
to
broadway
they
strolled
with
helen
faulkner
the
girl
he
meant
to
marry
if
he
ever
got
round
to
it
along
dignified
fifth
avenue
then
joyously
they
trooped
to
a
far
more
alluring
more
human
girl
who
pressed
a
bit
of
cambric
to
her
face
in
a
railway
station
while
a
agent
peeped
through
the
bars
how
ridiculously
small
that
bit
of
cambric
had
been
to
hide
so
much
beauty
soon
magee
thoughts
were
climbing
baldpate
mountain
there
to
wander
in
a
mystic
maze
of
ghostly
figures
which
appeared
from
the
shadows
holding
aloft
in
triumph
gigantic
keys
magee
had
slept
but
little
the
night
before
the
quick
december
dusk
filled
number
seven
when
he
awoke
with
a
start
he
remembered
that
he
had
asked
the
girl
to
come
back
to
the
office
and
berated
himself
to
think
that
probably
she
had
done
so
only
to
find
that
he
was
not
there
hastily
straightening
his
tie
and
dashing
the
traces
of
sleep
from
his
eyes
with
the
aid
of
cold
water
he
ran
the
great
bare
room
was
in
darkness
save
for
the
faint
red
of
the
fire
before
the
fireplace
sat
the
girl
of
the
station
her
hair
gleaming
with
a
new
splendor
in
that
light
she
looked
in
mock
reproval
at
magee
for
shame
she
said
to
be
late
at
the
a
thousand
pardons
magee
replied
i
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
of
a
girl
who
wept
in
a
railway
station
and
she
was
so
altogether
charming
i
could
not
tear
myself
away
i
fear
she
laughed
you
are
old
in
the
ways
of
the
world
a
passion
for
sleep
seems
to
have
seized
the
hermits
the
professor
has
gone
to
his
room
for
that
purpose
and
mr
bland
his
broken
heart
forgot
slumbers
over
there
she
pointed
to
the
haberdasher
inert
in
a
big
chair
drawn
up
near
the
clerk
desk
only
you
and
i
in
all
the
world
awake
pretty
lonesome
is
it
magee
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
shadows
that
crept
in
on
them
i
was
finding
it
very
busy
when
you
came
she
answered
you
see
i
have
known
the
inn
when
it
was
gay
with
summer
people
and
as
i
sat
here
by
the
fire
i
pretended
i
saw
the
ghosts
of
a
lot
of
the
people
i
knew
flitting
about
in
the
dusk
the
fleet
sailed
by
the
what
black
flag
flying
decks
cleared
for
action
i
saw
the
fleet
go
by
she
smiled
faintly
we
always
called
them
that
bitter
unkind
old
women
who
sat
hour
after
hour
on
the
veranda
and
rocked
and
gossiped
and
gossiped
and
rocked
all
the
old
women
in
the
world
seem
to
gather
at
summer
hotels
and
oh
the
cruel
mouths
the
fleet
had
just
thin
lines
of
mouths
i
used
to
look
at
them
and
wonder
if
any
one
had
ever
kissed
them
the
girl
eyes
were
very
large
and
tender
in
the
firelight
and
i
saw
some
poor
little
ghosts
weeping
in
a
corner
she
went
on
a
few
that
the
fleet
had
run
down
and
sunk
in
the
sea
of
gossip
a
little
ghost
whose
mother
had
not
been
all
she
should
have
been
and
the
fleet
found
it
out
and
rocked
and
whispered
and
she
went
away
and
a
few
who
were
poor
the
most
terrible
of
sins
to
them
the
fleet
showed
no
mercy
and
a
fine
proud
girl
myra
thornhill
who
was
engaged
to
a
man
named
kendrick
and
who
never
dared
come
here
again
after
kendrick
suddenly
disappeared
because
of
the
whispered
dishonors
the
fleet
heaped
upon
his
head
what
wicked
women
said
magee
the
wickedest
women
in
the
world
answered
the
girl
but
every
summer
resort
must
have
its
fleet
i
doubt
if
any
other
ever
had
its
admiral
though
and
that
makes
baldpate
supreme
its
admiral
yes
he
is
really
that
i
imagine
sort
of
a
vice
or
an
assistant
or
whatever
it
is
long
ago
retired
from
the
navy
every
summer
he
comes
here
and
the
place
revolves
about
him
it
all
so
funny
i
wonder
if
any
other
crowd
attains
such
heights
of
snobbishness
as
that
at
a
summer
resort
it
the
admiral
this
and
the
admiral
that
from
the
moment
he
enters
the
door
nearly
every
day
the
manager
of
baldpate
has
a
new
picture
of
the
admiral
taken
and
hangs
it
here
in
the
hotel
i
show
them
to
you
when
it
light
there
one
over
there
by
the
desk
of
the
admiral
and
the
manager
together
and
the
manager
has
thrown
his
arm
carelessly
over
the
admiral
shoulder
with
how
well
i
know
written
all
over
his
stupid
face
oh
what
snobs
they
are
and
the
fleet
asked
magee
worships
him
they
fish
all
day
for
a
smile
from
him
they
keep
track
of
his
goings
and
comings
and
when
he
is
in
the
playing
his
silly
old
game
of
solitaire
they
run
down
their
victims
in
subdued
tones
so
as
not
to
disturb
him
what
an
interesting
place
said
magee
i
must
visit
baldpate
next
summer
shall
shall
you
be
here
it
so
amusing
she
smiled
ignoring
the
question
you
enjoy
it
and
it
is
all
fleet
and
admiral
there
happiness
and
romance
and
whispering
on
the
stairs
at
night
when
the
lights
are
all
blazing
and
the
band
is
playing
waltzes
in
the
casino
and
somebody
is
giving
a
dinner
in
the
and
the
girls
flit
about
in
the
shadows
looking
too
sweet
for
words
well
baldpate
inn
is
a
rather
entrancing
spot
i
remember
those
nights
very
often
now
magee
leaned
closer
the
flicker
of
the
firelight
on
her
delicate
face
he
decided
was
an
excellent
effect
i
can
well
believe
you
do
remember
them
he
said
and
it
no
effort
at
all
to
me
to
picture
you
as
one
of
those
who
flitted
through
the
shadows
too
sweet
for
words
i
can
see
you
the
heroine
of
whispering
scenes
on
the
stair
i
can
see
you
walking
with
a
dazzled
happy
man
on
the
mountain
in
the
moonlight
many
men
have
loved
you
are
you
reading
my
palm
she
asked
laughing
no
your
face
answered
magee
many
men
have
loved
you
for
very
few
men
are
blind
i
am
sorry
i
was
not
the
man
on
the
stair
or
on
the
mountain
in
the
moonlight
who
knows
i
might
have
been
the
favored
one
for
my
single
summer
of
joy
the
autumn
always
came
smiled
the
girl
it
would
never
have
come
for
me
he
answered
wo
you
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
have
no
part
in
this
strange
drama
that
is
going
on
at
baldpate
wo
you
credit
it
when
i
say
that
i
have
no
idea
why
you
and
the
professor
and
mr
bland
are
here
nor
why
the
mayor
of
reuton
has
the
fifth
key
wo
you
tell
me
what
it
all
means
i
must
she
replied
shaking
her
head
i
can
trust
no
one
not
even
you
i
must
believe
that
you
do
know
it
preposterous
i
must
say
over
and
over
even
he
is
simply
will
you
pardon
me
flirting
trying
to
learn
what
he
can
learn
i
must
you
ca
even
tell
me
why
you
wept
in
the
station
for
a
simple
silly
reason
i
was
afraid
i
had
taken
up
a
task
too
big
for
me
by
far
taken
it
up
bravely
when
i
was
out
in
the
sunlight
of
reuton
but
when
i
saw
upper
asquewan
falls
and
the
dark
came
and
that
dingy
station
swallowed
me
up
something
gave
way
inside
me
and
i
felt
i
was
going
to
fail
so
i
cried
a
woman
way
if
i
were
only
permitted
to
help
magee
pleaded
no
i
must
go
forward
alone
i
can
trust
no
one
now
perhaps
things
will
change
i
hope
they
will
listen
said
magee
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
perhaps
you
read
a
novel
called
lost
he
was
resolved
to
claim
its
authorship
tell
her
of
his
real
purpose
in
coming
to
baldpate
and
urge
her
to
confide
in
him
regarding
the
odd
happenings
at
the
inn
yes
said
the
girl
before
he
could
continue
i
did
read
it
and
it
hurt
me
it
was
so
terribly
insincere
the
man
had
talent
who
wrote
it
but
he
seemed
to
say
all
a
great
big
joke
i
do
believe
in
these
people
myself
i
just
created
them
to
make
them
dance
for
you
do
be
fooled
it
only
a
novel
i
do
like
that
sort
of
thing
i
want
a
writer
really
to
mean
all
he
says
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
magee
bit
his
lip
his
determination
to
claim
the
authorship
of
lost
was
quite
gone
i
want
him
to
make
me
feel
with
his
people
the
girl
went
on
seriously
perhaps
i
can
explain
by
telling
you
of
something
that
happened
to
me
once
it
was
while
i
was
at
college
there
was
a
blind
girl
in
my
class
and
one
night
i
went
to
call
on
her
i
met
her
in
the
corridor
of
her
dormitory
somebody
had
just
brought
her
back
from
an
evening
lecture
and
left
her
there
she
unlocked
her
door
and
we
went
in
it
was
pitch
dark
in
the
room
the
first
thing
i
thought
of
was
a
light
but
she
she
just
sat
down
and
began
to
talk
she
had
forgot
to
light
the
gas
the
girl
paused
her
eyes
very
wide
and
it
seemed
to
magee
that
she
shivered
slightly
can
you
imagine
it
she
asked
she
chatted
on
quite
cheerfully
as
i
remember
it
and
i
i
stumbled
round
and
fell
into
a
chair
cold
and
trembly
and
sick
with
the
awful
horror
of
blindness
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
thought
i
had
imagined
before
what
it
was
to
be
blind
just
by
shutting
my
eyes
for
a
second
but
as
i
sat
there
in
the
blackness
and
listened
to
that
girl
chatter
and
realized
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
to
light
a
lamp
then
for
the
first
time
i
knew
i
knew
again
she
stopped
and
magee
looking
at
her
felt
what
he
had
never
experienced
before
a
thrill
at
a
woman
near
presence
that
what
i
ask
of
a
writer
she
said
that
he
make
me
feel
for
his
people
as
i
felt
for
that
girl
that
night
am
i
asking
too
much
it
need
not
be
for
one
who
is
enmeshed
in
tragedy
it
may
be
for
one
whose
heart
is
as
glad
as
a
may
morning
but
he
must
make
me
feel
and
he
ca
do
that
if
he
does
feel
himself
can
he
william
hallowell
magee
actually
hung
his
head
he
ca
he
confessed
softly
you
quite
right
i
like
you
immensely
more
than
i
can
say
and
even
if
you
feel
you
ca
trust
me
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
on
your
side
in
whatever
happens
at
baldpate
inn
you
have
only
to
ask
and
i
am
your
ally
thank
you
she
answered
i
may
be
very
glad
to
ask
i
shall
remember
she
rose
and
moved
toward
the
stairs
we
had
better
disperse
now
the
fleet
will
get
us
if
we
do
watch
out
her
small
slipper
was
on
the
first
step
of
the
stair
when
they
heard
a
door
slammed
shut
and
the
sound
of
steps
on
the
bare
floor
of
the
then
a
husky
voice
called
bland
magee
felt
his
hand
grasped
by
a
much
smaller
one
and
before
he
knew
it
he
had
been
hurried
to
the
shadows
of
the
landing
the
fifth
key
whispered
a
scared
little
voice
in
his
ear
and
then
he
felt
the
faint
brushing
of
across
his
lips
a
mad
desire
seized
him
to
grasp
those
fingers
and
hold
them
on
the
lips
they
had
scarcely
touched
but
the
impulse
was
lost
in
the
thrill
of
seeing
the
door
thrown
open
and
a
great
bulk
of
a
man
cross
the
floor
of
the
office
and
stand
beside
bland
chair
at
his
side
was
a
thin
waif
who
had
not
unjustly
been
termed
the
mayor
of
reuton
shadow
asleep
bellowed
the
big
man
how
this
for
a
lou
right
on
the
job
ai
he
sneered
the
thin
one
mr
bland
started
suddenly
from
slumber
and
looked
up
into
the
eyes
of
the
newcomers
hello
cargan
he
said
hello
lou
for
the
love
of
heaven
shout
so
the
place
is
full
of
them
full
of
what
asked
the
mayor
of
spotters
maybe
i
do
know
what
they
are
there
an
old
and
a
fresh
young
guy
and
two
women
people
gasped
the
mayor
people
here
sure

asleep
bland
no
i
not
cargan
cried
the
haberdasher
look
around
for
yourself
the
inn
overrun
with
them
cargan
leaned
weakly
against
a
chair
well
what
do
you
know
about
that
he
said
and
they
kept
telling
me
baldpate
inn
was
the
best
place
say
this
is
one
on
andy
rutter
why
did
you
get
it
out
and
beat
it
how
could
i
mr
bland
asked
i
have
got
the
combination
the
safe
was
left
open
for
me
that
was
the
agreement
with
rutter
you
might
have
phoned
us
not
to
come
remarked
lou
with
an
uneasy
glance
around
cargan
hit
the
mantelpiece
with
his
huge
fist
by
heaven
no
he
cried
i
lift
it
from
under
their
very
noses
i
done
it
before
i
can
do
it
now
i
do
care
who
they
are
they
ca
touch
me
they
ca
touch
jim
cargan
i
ai
afraid
magee
on
the
landing
whispered
into
his
companion
ear
i
think
i
go
down
and
greet
our
guests
he
felt
her
grasp
his
arm
suddenly
as
though
in
fear
but
he
shook
off
her
hand
and
debonairly
descended
to
the
group
below
good
evening
gentlemen
he
said
suavely
welcome
to
baldpate
please
do
attempt
to
explain
we
fed
up
on
explanations
now
you
have
the
fifth
key
of
course
welcome
to
our
small
but
growing
circle
the
big
man
advanced
threateningly
magee
saw
that
his
face
was
very
red
his
neck
very
thick
but
his
mouth
a
cute
little
cupid
bow
that
might
well
have
adorned
a
dainty
baby
in
the
park
who
are
you
bellowed
the
mayor
of
reuton
in
a
tone
meant
to
be
cowering
i
forget
replied
magee
easily
bland
who
am
i
the
lover
of
arabella
the
fleeing
artist
or
the
thief
of
portraits
from
a
new
york
millionaire
home
really
it
does
matter
we
shift
our
stories
from
time
to
time
as
the
first
of
the
baldpate
hermits
however
it
is
my
duty
to
welcome
you
which
i
hereby
do
the
mayor
pointed
dramatically
to
the
stair
i
give
you
fifteen
minutes
he
roared
to
pack
up
and
get
out
i
do
want
you
here
understand
to
cargan
side
came
the
slinking
figure
of
lou
max
his
face
was
the
withered
yellow
of
an
old
lemon
his
garb
suggested
on
dirty
side
streets
unpleasant
eyes
shifted
behind
a
pair
of
glasses
his
attitude
was
that
of
the
dog
who
crouches
by
its
master
clear
out
he
snarled
by
no
means
replied
magee
looking
the
mayor
squarely
in
the
eye
i
was
here
first
i
here
to
stay
put
me
out
will
you
well
perhaps
after
a
fight
but
i
be
back
in
an
hour
and
with
me
whatever
police
upper
asquewan
falls
owns
to
he
saw
that
the
opposing
force
wavered
at
this
i
want
no
trouble
gentlemen
he
went
on
believe
me
i
shall
be
happy
to
have
your
company
to
dinner
your
command
that
i
withdraw
is
not
to
say
and
impolite
let
us
all
forget
it
the
mayor
of
reuton
turned
away
and
his
dog
slid
into
the
shadows
have
i
your
promise
to
stay
to
dinner
went
on
magee
no
answer
came
from
the
trio
in
the
dusk
silence
gives
consent
he
added
gaily
you
must
excuse
me
while
i
dress
bland
will
you
inform
peters
that
we
are
to
have
company
to
dinner
handle
him
gently
emphasize
the
fact
that
our
guests
are
men
he
ran
up
the
stairs
at
the
top
of
the
second
flight
he
met
the
girl
and
her
eyes
he
thought
shone
in
the
dark
oh
i
so
glad
she
whispered
glad
of
what
asked
magee
that
you
are
not
on
their
side
she
answered
magee
paused
at
the
door
of
number
seven
i
should
say
not
he
remarked
whatever
it
all
about
i
should
say
not
put
on
your
prettiest
gown
my
lady
i
invited
the
mayor
to
dinner
chapter
vii
the
mayor
begins
a
vigil
one
summer
evening
in
dim
dead
days
gone
by
an
inexperienced
head
waiter
at
baldpate
inn
had
attempted
to
seat
sanderson
clark
of
pittsburgh
at
the
same
table
with
the
unassuming
smiths
of
tiffin
ohio
the
remarks
of
clark
who
was
at
the
time
busily
engaged
in
trying
to
found
a
first
family
lingered
long
in
the
memory
of
those
who
heard
them
so
long
in
fact
that
miss
norton
standing
with
magee
in
the
hotel
office
awaiting
the
signal
from
peters
that
dinner
was
ready
could
repeat
them
almost
verbatim
magee
cast
a
humorous
look
about
lucky
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
summer
folks
are
carried
over
into
the
winter
he
said
imagine
a
clark
asked
to
sit
at
table
with
the
mayor
of
reuton
and
his
picturesque
but
somewhat
soiled
friend
max
i
hope
the
dinner
is
a
huge
success
the
girl
laughed
the
natural
nervousness
of
a
host
she
remarked
do
worry
the
hermit
and
his
tins
wo
fail
you
it
not
the
culinary
end
that
worries
me
smiled
magee
it
the
repartee
and
wit
i
want
the
mayor
to
feel
at
home
do
you
know
any
good
stories
ascribed
to
congressman
jones
of
the
asquewan
district
together
they
strolled
to
a
window
the
snow
had
begun
to
fall
again
and
the
lights
of
the
little
hamlet
below
showed
but
dimly
through
the
white
blur
i
want
you
to
know
said
the
girl
that
i
trust
you
now
and
when
the
time
comes
as
it
will
soon
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
help
me
i
may
ask
a
rather
big
thing
and
ask
you
to
do
it
blindly
just
trusting
in
me
as
i
refused
to
trust
in
you
she
stopped
and
looked
very
seriously
into
magee
face
i
mighty
glad
he
answered
in
a
low
tone
from
the
moment
i
saw
you
weeping
in
the
station
i
wanted
to
be
of
help
to
you
the
station
agent
advised
me
not
to
interfere
he
said
to
become
involved
with
a
weeping
woman
meant
trouble
the
fool
as
though
any
trouble
he
was
right
put
in
the
girl
it
probably
will
mean
trouble
as
though
any
storm
finished
magee
would
not
be
worth
the
rainbow
of
your
smile
at
the
end
a
very
fancy
figure
laughed
she
but
storms
are
nice
there
are
a
few
of
us
replied
magee
who
can
be
merry
through
the
worst
of
them
because
of
the
rainbow
to
come
for
answer
she
flattened
her
nose
into
shapelessness
against
the
cold
pane
back
of
them
in
the
room
the
motley
crew
of
baldpate
winter
guests
stood
about
in
various
attitudes
of
waiting
in
front
of
the
fire
the
holder
of
the
chair
of
comparative
literature
quoted
poetry
to
norton
and
probably
it
never
occurred
to
the
old
man
that
the
woman
to
whom
he
talked
was
that
nightmare
of
his
life
a
peroxide
blonde
ten
feet
away
in
the
flickering
the
immense
bulk
of
the
mayor
of
reuton
reposed
on
the
arm
of
a
leather
couch
and
before
him
stood
his
lithe
unpleasant
companion
lou
max
side
by
side
with
mr
bland
whose
talk
of
haberdashery
was
forever
stilled
the
candles
sputtered
the
storm
angrily
rattled
the
windows
peters
flitted
like
a
hairy
wraith
about
the
table
so
the
strange
game
that
was
being
played
at
baldpate
inn
followed
the
example
of
good
digestion
and
waited
on
appetite
what
magee
flippantly
termed
his
dinner
party
was
seated
at
last
and
there
began
a
meal
destined
to
linger
long
in
the
memories
of
those
who
partook
if
it
puzzled
beyond
words
the
host
took
stock
of
his
guests
opposite
him
at
the
foot
of
the
table
he
could
see
the
lined
tired
face
of
norton
dazed
uncomprehending
a
little
frightened
at
his
right
the
great
red
acreage
of
cargan
face
held
defiance
and
some
amusement
beside
it
sneered
the
cruel
face
of
max
beyond
that
mr
bland
countenance
told
a
story
of
worry
and
impotent
anger
and
on
magee
left
sat
the
professor
bearded
spectacled
calm
seemingly
undisturbed
by
this
queer
flurry
of
events
beside
the
fair
girl
of
the
station
who
trusted
magee
at
last
in
the
first
few
moments
of
silence
magee
compared
her
delicate
features
with
the
coarse
knowing
face
of
the
woman
at
the
table
foot
and
inwardly
answered
no
without
the
genial
complement
of
talk
the
dinner
began
peters
appeared
with
another
variety
of
his
canned
soup
whereupon
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
gastronomic
endeavors
of
max
and
the
mayor
magee
was
reflecting
that
conversation
must
be
encouraged
when
cargan
suddenly
spoke
i
hope
i
ai
putting
you
folks
out
none
he
remarked
with
obvious
sarcasm
it
ai
my
habit
to
drop
in
unexpected
like
this
but
business
we
delighted
i
sure
said
magee
politely
i
suppose
you
want
to
know
why
i
here
the
mayor
went
on
well
he
hesitated
it
like
this
dear
cargan
magee
broke
in
spare
us
i
pray
and
spare
yourself
we
have
had
explanations
until
we
are
weary
we
have
decided
to
drop
them
altogether
and
just
to
take
it
for
granted
that
in
the
words
of
the
song
we
here
because
we
here
all
right
replied
cargan
evidently
relieved
that
suits
me
tired
explaining
anyhow
there
a
bunch
of
reformers
rose
up
lately
in
reuton
maybe
you
heard
about
a
lovely
bunch
a
white
necktie
and
a
of
brains
apiece
they
say
they
going
to
do
for
me
at
the
next
election
max
laughed
harshly
from
the
vicinity
of
his
soup
they
wrote
the
first
joke
book
them
people
he
said
well
went
on
cargan
there
ai
nobody
so
insignificant
and
piffling
that
people
wo
listen
to
when
they
attack
a
man
in
public
life
so
i
had
to
reply
to
this
comic
opera
bunch
and
as
i
say
i
about
wore
out
explaining
i
had
to
explain
that
i
never
stole
the
town
i
used
to
live
in
in
indiana
and
that
i
did
stick
up
my
father
with
a
knife
it
gets
monotonous
so
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
passing
the
explanations
up
we
wo
bother
you
long
me
and
lou
i
got
a
little
business
here
and
then
we
mosey
along
we
clear
out
about
nine
no
protested
magee
so
soon
we
must
make
it
pleasant
for
you
while
you
stay
i
always
hate
hosts
who
talk
about
their
servants
i
have
a
friend
who
bores
me
to
death
because
he
has
a
jap
butler
he
believes
was
at
mukden
but
i
think
i
am
justified
in
calling
your
attention
to
ours
peters
the
hermit
of
baldpate
mountain
cooking
is
merely
his
avocation
he
is
writing
a
book
that
guy
remarked
cargan
incredulous
what
do
you
know
about
that
asked
mr
bland
it
certainly
will
get
a
lot
of
hot
advertising
if
it
ever
appears
it
meant
to
prove
that
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
has
been
caused
by
woman
the
mayor
considered
he
off
he
nutty
that
fellow
he
announced
it
ai
women
that
cause
all
of
the
trouble
thank
you
cargan
said
miss
norton
smiling
anybody
know
it
to
look
at
you
miss
replied
the
mayor
in
his
most
gallant
manner
then
he
added
hastily
and
you
with
a
nod
in
the
other
woman
direction
i
do
know
as
i
got
the
evidence
in
my
face
responded
norton
easily
but
women
do
make
no
trouble
i
know
that
i
think
the
crazy
myself
and
i
tell
him
so
if
he
was
the
cook
she
paused
for
peters
had
entered
the
room
there
was
silence
while
he
changed
the
courses
it
getting
so
now
you
ca
say
the
things
to
a
cook
you
can
to
a
king
she
finished
after
the
hermit
had
retired
ahem
cargan
put
in
professor
bolton
you
give
it
as
your
opinion
that
woman
is
no
and
i
must
admit
that
i
agree
with
your
premise
in
general
although
occasionally
she
may
cause
a
a
slight
annoyance
undeniably
there
is
a
lot
of
trouble
in
the
world
to
whose
efforts
do
you
ascribe
it
the
mayor
ran
his
thick
fingers
through
his
hair
i
got
you
he
said
and
i
got
your
answer
too
who
makes
the
trouble
who
made
it
from
the
beginning
of
time
the
reformers
doc
yes
sir
who
was
the
first
reformer
the
snake
in
the
garden
of
eden
this
hermit
guy
probably
has
that
affair
laid
down
at
woman
door
not
much
everything
was
running
all
right
around
the
garden
and
then
the
snake
came
along
it
a
twenty
to
one
shot
he
just
finished
a
series
of
articles
on
shame
of
eden
for
a
magazine
d
mean
he
says
to
the
woman
letting
well
enough
alone
things
are
all
wrong
here
the
present
administration
is
running
everything
into
the
ground
i
can
tell
you
a
few
things
that
will
open
your
eyes
what
that
what
you
do
know
wo
hurt
you
the
old
cry
he
says
old
cry
against
which
progressives
got
to
fight
he
says
up
you
need
a
change
here
try
this
nice
red
apple
and
you
see
things
the
way
i
do
and
the
woman
fell
for
it
you
know
what
happened
an
original
point
of
view
said
the
dazed
professor
yes
doc
went
on
cargan
evidently
on
a
favorite
topic
it
the
reformers
that
have
caused
all
the
trouble
from
that
snake
down
things
are
running
smooth
folks
all
prosperous
and
satisfied
then
they
come
along
in
their
gum
shoes
and
white
neckties
and
they
knock
away
at
the
existing
order
until
the
public
begins
to
believe
and
gives
a
chance
to
run
things
what
the
result
the
world
in
a
worse
tangle
than
ever
before
you
feel
deeply
on
the
subject
cargan
remarked
magee
i
ought
to
the
mayor
replied
i
ai
no
writer
but
if
i
was
turn
out
a
book
that
would
drive
this
whiskered
hermit
argument
to
the
wall
woman
bah
the
only
way
women
make
trouble
is
by
falling
for
the
reform
gag
peters
here
interrupted
with
the
dessert
and
through
that
course
cargan
elaborated
on
his
theory
he
pointed
out
how
in
many
states
reform
had
interrupted
the
smooth
flow
of
life
set
everything
awhirl
and
cruelly
sent
the
boys
who
had
always
been
faithful
out
into
the
cold
world
seeking
the
stranger
work
while
he
talked
the
eyes
of
lou
max
looked
out
at
him
from
behind
the
incongruous
glasses
with
the
devotion
of
the
dog
to
its
master
clearly
written
in
them
magee
had
read
many
articles
about
this
picturesque
cargan
who
had
fought
his
way
with
his
fists
to
the
position
of
practical
dictator
in
the
city
of
reuton
the
story
was
seldom
told
without
a
mention
of
his
man
max
lou
max
who
kept
the
south
end
of
reuton
in
line
for
the
mayor
and
in
that
low
neighborhood
of
dives
and
squalor
made
cargan
a
name
to
conjure
with
watching
him
now
magee
marveled
at
this
cheap
creature
evident
capacity
for
loyalty
it
was
the
reformers
got
napoleon
the
mayor
finished
yes
they
sent
napoleon
to
an
island
at
the
end
and
him
without
an
equal
since
the
world
began
is
your
begging
your
pardon
is
your
history
just
straight
demurred
professor
bolton
timidly
is
it
frowned
cargan
you
can
bet
it
is
i
know
napoleon
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
i
ai
an
educated
man
doc
i
can
hire
all
the
educated
men
i
want
for
eighteen
dollars
a
week
but
i
up
on
bonaparte
it
seems
to
me
miss
norton
put
in
i
have
heard
did
i
read
it
in
a
paper
that
a
picture
of
napoleon
hangs
above
your
desk
they
say
that
you
see
in
your
own
career
a
similarity
to
his
may
i
ask
is
it
true
no
miss
replied
cargan
that
a
joking
story
some
newspaper
guy
wrote
up
it
ai
got
no
more
truth
in
it
than
most
newspaper
yarn
no
i
ai
no
napoleon
there
lots
of
differences
between
us
one
in
particular
he
raised
his
voice
and
glared
at
the
company
around
the
table
one
in
particular
the
reformers
got
napoleon
at
the
end
but
the
end
is
not
yet
suggested
magee
smiling
cargan
gave
him
a
sudden
and
interested
look
i
ai
worrying
he
replied
and
do
you
young
fellow
magee
responded
that
he
was
not
one
to
indulge
in
needless
worry
and
a
silence
fell
upon
the
group
peters
entered
with
coffee
and
was
engaged
in
pouring
it
when
mr
bland
started
up
wildly
from
the
table
with
an
expression
of
alarm
on
his
face
what
that
he
cried
the
others
looked
at
him
in
wonder
i
heard
steps
he
declared
nonsense
said
cargan
you
dreaming
this
peace
and
quiet
has
got
to
you
bland
without
replying
mr
bland
rose
and
ran
up
the
stair
in
his
absence
the
hermit
of
baldpate
spoke
into
magee
ear
i
ai
one
to
complain
he
said
livin
alone
as
much
as
i
do
sort
of
got
out
of
the
habit
having
nobody
to
complain
to
but
if
folks
keep
coming
and
coming
to
this
hotel
i
got
to
resign
as
cook
seems
as
though
every
few
minutes
there
a
new
face
at
the
table
and
it
a
vital
matter
to
me
cheer
up
peters
whispered
magee
there
are
only
two
more
keys
to
the
inn
there
will
be
a
limit
to
our
guests
what
i
getting
at
is
replied
peters
there
a
limit
to
my
endurance
mr
bland
came
his
face
was
very
pale
as
he
took
his
seat
but
in
reply
to
cargan
question
he
remarked
that
he
must
have
been
mistaken
it
was
the
wind
i
guess
he
said
the
mayor
made
facetious
comment
on
mr
bland
skittishness
and
max
also
indulged
in
a
gibe
or
two
these
the
haberdasher
met
with
a
wan
smile
so
the
dinner
came
to
an
end
and
the
guests
of
baldpate
sat
about
while
peters
removed
all
traces
of
it
from
the
table
magee
sought
to
talk
to
miss
norton
but
found
her
nervous
and
distrait
has
mr
bland
frightened
you
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
i
have
other
things
to
think
of
she
replied
peters
shortly
bade
the
company
for
the
night
with
the
warmly
expressed
hope
in
magee
ear
that
there
would
be
no
further
additions
to
the
circle
in
the
near
future
when
he
had
started
off
through
the
snow
for
his
shack
cargan
took
out
his
watch
you
been
pretty
kind
to
us
poor
wanderers
already
he
said
i
got
one
more
favor
to
ask
i
come
up
here
to
see
mr
bland
we
got
some
business
to
transact
and
we
consider
it
a
great
kindness
if
you
was
to
leave
us
alone
here
in
the
office
magee
hesitated
he
saw
the
girl
nod
her
head
slightly
and
move
toward
the
stairs
certainly
if
you
wish
he
said
i
hope
you
wo
go
without
saying
mr
cargan
that
all
depends
replied
the
mayor
i
enjoyed
knowing
you
one
and
all
good
night
the
women
the
professor
and
magee
moved
up
the
broad
stairway
on
the
landing
magee
heard
the
voice
of
norton
somewhere
in
the
darkness
ahead
i
worried
dearie
real
worried
hush
came
the
girl
voice
meet
again
soon
magee
seized
the
professor
arm
and
together
they
stood
in
the
shadows
i
do
like
the
looks
of
things
came
bland
hoarse
complaint
from
below
what
time
is
it
cargan
answered
a
good
yet
there
was
somebody
on
the
second
floor
when
i
went
up
bland
continued
i
saw
him
run
into
one
of
the
rooms
and
lock
the
door
i
got
charge
now
the
mayor
reassured
him
do
you
worry
there
something
doing
this
seemed
to
be
max
voice
there
sure
is
laughed
cargan
but
what
do
i
care
i
own
young
drayton
i
put
him
where
he
is
i
ai
afraid
let
them
gumshoe
round
as
much
as
they
want
to
they
ca
touch
me
maybe
not
said
bland
but
baldpate
inn
ai
the
grand
idea
it
looked
at
first
is
it
it
a
hell
of
an
idea
answered
cargan
there
was
any
need
of
all
this
folderol
i
told
hayden
so
does
that
phone
ring
no
it
just
flash
a
light
when
they
want
us
bland
told
him
magee
and
professor
bolton
continued
softly
up
the
stairs
and
in
answer
to
the
former
invitation
the
old
man
entered
number
seven
and
took
a
chair
by
the
fire
it
is
an
amazing
tangle
he
remarked
in
which
we
are
involved
i
have
no
idea
what
your
place
is
in
the
scheme
of
things
up
here
but
i
assume
you
grasp
what
is
going
on
if
i
do
not
i
am
not
so
keen
of
wit
as
i
once
was
if
you
think
answered
magee
proffering
a
cigar
that
i
am
in
on
this
little
game
of
who
then
you
are
vastly
mistaken
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
as
much
in
the
dark
as
you
are
the
professor
smiled
indeed
he
said
in
a
tone
that
showed
his
unbelief
indeed
he
was
deep
in
a
discussion
of
the
meters
of
the
poet
chaucer
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
lou
max
unpleasant
head
was
thrust
inside
i
been
assigned
he
said
to
sit
up
here
in
the
hall
and
keep
an
eye
out
for
the
ghost
bland
heard
tramping
about
and
being
of
a
sociable
nature
i
like
to
sit
in
your
doorway
if
you
do
mind
by
all
means
replied
magee
here
a
chair
do
you
smoke
thanks
max
placed
the
chair
sidewise
in
the
doorway
of
number
seven
and
sat
down
from
his
place
he
commanded
a
view
of
apartments
and
of
the
head
of
the
stairs
with
his
yellow
teeth
he
viciously
bit
the
end
from
the
cigar
do
let
me
interrupt
the
conversation
gentlemen
he
pleaded
we
were
speaking
said
the
professor
calmly
of
the
versification
of
chaucer
magee
he
continued
his
discussion
in
an
even
voice
magee
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
smiled
in
a
pleased
way
at
the
settings
of
the
stage
max
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
on
guard
at
his
door
the
mayor
and
mr
bland
keeping
vigil
by
a
telephone
switchboard
in
the
office
below
watching
for
the
flash
of
light
that
should
tell
them
some
one
in
the
outside
world
wanted
to
speak
to
baldpate
inn
a
mysterious
figure
who
flitted
about
in
the
dark
a
beautiful
girl
who
was
going
to
ask
magee
to
do
her
a
service
blindly
trusting
her
the
professor
droned
on
monotonously
once
magee
interrupted
to
engage
lou
max
in
spirited
conversation
for
through
the
squares
of
light
outside
the
windows
he
had
seen
the
girl
of
the
station
pass
hurriedly
down
the
balcony
the
snowflakes
falling
white
on
her
yellow
hair
chapter
viii
max
tells
a
tale
of
suspicion
an
hour
passed
max
admitted
when
pressed
that
a
good
cigar
soothed
the
soul
and
accepted
another
from
magee
stock
the
professor
continued
to
talk
obviously
it
was
his
favorite
diversion
he
seemed
to
be
quoting
from
addresses
magee
pictured
him
on
a
chautauqua
platform
the
white
water
pitcher
by
his
side
as
he
talked
magee
studied
that
portion
of
his
delicate
scholarly
face
that
the
beard
left
exposed
to
the
world
what
part
had
thaddeus
bolton
holder
of
the
crandall
chair
of
comparative
literature
in
this
network
of
odd
alarms
why
was
he
at
baldpate
and
why
was
he
so
little
moved
by
the
rapid
changes
in
the
of
the
inn
colony
changes
that
left
magee
gasping
he
took
them
as
calmly
as
he
would
take
his
grapefruit
at
the
only
that
morning
magee
by
way
of
experiment
had
fastened
upon
him
the
suspicion
of
murder
and
the
old
man
had
not
flickered
an
eyelash
not
the
least
strange
of
all
the
strange
figures
that
floated
about
baldpate
magee
reflected
was
this
man
who
fiddled
now
with
chaucer
while
metaphorically
rome
burned
he
could
not
make
it
out
max
inserted
a
loud
yawn
into
the
professor
discourse
once
i
played
chess
with
a
german
he
said
and
another
time
i
went
to
a
lecture
on
purifying
politics
but
i
never
struck
anything
so
monotonous
as
this
job
i
got
now
so
sorry
replied
magee
that
our
company
bores
you
no
offense
remarked
the
one
i
was
just
thinking
as
i
set
here
how
it
all
comes
of
people
being
suspicious
of
one
another
now
i
always
held
that
the
world
would
be
a
better
place
if
there
no
suspicion
in
it
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
suspicion
ai
got
a
leg
to
stand
on
if
suspicion
can
be
said
to
have
a
leg
evidently
max
desired
the
floor
graciously
professor
bolton
conceded
it
to
him
speaking
of
suspicion
continued
the
drab
little
man
on
the
threshold
turning
his
cigar
thoughtfully
between
his
thin
lips
reminds
me
of
a
case
told
me
by
pueblo
sam
a
few
years
ago
in
some
ways
it
real
funny
and
in
others
it
sad
as
hell
pueblo
sam
was
called
in
them
terms
because
he
never
been
west
of
sixth
avenue
he
was
a
swell
refined
gentleman
who
lived
by
his
wits
and
he
had
considerable
a
confidence
man
suggested
magee
something
along
that
order
admitted
max
but
a
good
sport
among
his
friends
you
understand
well
this
case
of
suspicion
sam
tells
me
about
happened
something
like
this
one
scorching
hot
day
in
summer
sam
gets
aboard
the
coney
boat
his
idea
being
to
put
all
business
cares
away
for
an
hour
or
two
and
just
float
calm
and
peaceful
down
the
bay
and
cool
off
so
he
grabs
out
a
camp
chair
and
hustles
through
the
crowd
up
to
the
top
deck
beside
the
pilot
hangout
and
sits
down
to
get
acquainted
with
the
breeze
if
such
there
was
well
he
been
sitting
there
about
ten
minutes
sam
tells
me
when
along
came
about
the
easiest
picking
that
ever
got
loose
from
the
old
homestead
i
beg
your
pardon
protested
professor
bolton
the
ready
money
the
loosened
kale
the
posies
in
the
garden
waiting
to
be
plucked
elucidated
max
this
guy
sam
says
was
such
a
perfect
rube
he
just
naturally
looked
past
him
to
see
if
there
was
a
trail
of
wisps
of
hay
on
the
floor
for
a
while
sam
sits
there
with
a
grouch
as
he
thought
how
hard
it
was
to
put
business
aside
and
get
a
little
rest
now
and
then
and
debating
whether
being
on
a
vacation
as
it
was
exert
himself
enough
to
stretch
forth
his
hand
and
take
whatever
money
the
guy
had
while
he
was
arguing
the
matter
with
himself
the
jay
settled
the
question
by
coming
over
and
sitting
down
near
him
he
in
the
city
he
tells
sam
to
enjoy
the
moving
pictures
of
the
streets
and
otherwise
forget
the
trees
back
home
that
grow
the
cherries
in
the
bottom
of
the
cocktail
glasses
believe
me
he
says
to
sam
ai
none
of
those
confidence
men
going
to
get
me
i
too
wise
he
says
bet
money
you
are
sam
tells
him
laughing
all
over
at
the
fish
that
was
fighting
to
get
into
the
net
siree
says
the
last
of
the
mohicans
ca
fool
me
i
can
tell
them
as
fur
away
as
i
can
see
and
my
eyesight
perfect
one
of
comes
up
to
me
in
city
hall
park
and
tries
to
sell
me
some
mining
stock
i
guess
he
ai
recovered
yet
from
what
i
said
to
him
i
tell
you
they
ca
fool
mark
dennen
says
the
guy
sam
told
me
that
at
them
words
he
just
leaned
back
in
his
seat
and
stared
at
the
jay
and
whistled
under
his
breath
years
ago
it
seemed
sam
had
lived
in
the
town
of
readsboro
vermont
and
run
up
and
down
the
streets
with
one
suspender
and
a
stone
bruise
and
the
kid
that
had
run
with
him
was
mark
dennen
and
sam
says
he
looked
at
this
guy
from
the
woods
that
was
running
round
crying
to
high
heaven
he
needed
a
guardian
and
he
sees
that
sure
enough
it
was
the
mark
dennen
and
sam
told
me
something
seemed
to
bust
inside
him
and
he
wanted
to
stretch
out
his
arms
and
hug
this
guy
dennen
shouts
sam
i
live
of
readsboro
vermont
the
kid
i
used
to
play
with
under
the
arc
lights
do
you
remember
me
but
sam
says
the
guy
just
looked
him
straight
in
the
eye
and
shut
his
jaw
and
says
suppose
you
be
asking
after
my
brother
george
next
ai
got
any
brother
george
you
idiot
laughs
sam
he
told
me
he
was
thinking
how
he
treat
his
old
friend
mark
to
a
dinner
that
would
go
down
in
history
in
readsboro
you
old
rascal
he
says

me
do
you
remember
little
sam
burns
that
used
to
play
with
you
and
that
stole
your
girl
in
do
you
remember
the
old
days
in
readsboro
he
was
all
het
up
by
this
time
sam
tells
me
and
all
the
old
memories
came
creeping
back
and
he
kept
thinking
he
never
was
so
glad
to
run
across
anybody
in
his
life
remember
little
sam
burns
do
you
he
asks
once
more
but
this
guy
just
looks
back
into
sam
eye
with
his
own
cold
as
steel
and
he
says
says
he
pretty
clever
mister
but
you
do
fool
me
no

games

across
from

miss

and
a
high
squeaky
voice

business

wonderful
how
you
know
all
these
things
wonderful
but
you
ca
fool
me
he
says
ca
fool
mark
dennen
max
paused
in
his
narrative
for
a
moment
the
sound
of
voices
came
up
from
the
office
of
baldpate
inn
one
that
of
the
mayor
boomed
loudly
and
angrily
in
an
evident
desire
to
drown
it
max
went
on
with
spirit
well
gentlemen
it
got
to
be
a
point
of
honor
as
you
might
say
for
sam
to
convince
that
guy
he
told
me
he
never
wanted
anything
so
much
in
his
life
as
for
mark
dennen
to
give
in
it
was
a
hot
afternoon
and
come
aboard
that
boat
for
a
rest
but
he
peeled
off
his
collar
and
started
in
he
gave
mark
dennen
the
number
of
bricks
in
the
methodist
church
as
reported
in
the
readsboro
at
the
time
it
was
built
he
told
him
the
name
of
the
piece
mark
sister
recited
at
the
school
entertainment
in
the
spring
of
he
bounded
on
all
four
sides
the
lot
where
the
circuses
played
when
they
came
to
readsboro
he
named
every
citizen
of
the
town
living
or
dead
that
ever
got
to
be
known
outside
his
own
family
and
he
brought
children
into
the
world
and
married
them
and
read
the
funeral
service
over
them
and
still
that
bonehead
from
the
woods
sat
there
his
mouth
open
and
says
beyond
me
how
you
know
all
that
you
new
yorkers
are
slicker
then
i
give
ye
credit
for
but
you
ca
fool
me
you
ai
sam
burns
why
i
went
to
school
with
him
they
was
drawing
near
coney
now
went
on
max
and
sam
face
was
purple
and
he
was
dripping
with
perspiration
and
rattling
off
readsboro
happenings
at
the
rate
of
ten
a
second
but
that
mark
dennen
he
sat
there
and
would
budge
from
his
high
horse
so
they
came
up
to
the
pier
sam
almost
weeping
real
tears
and
pleading
like
his
heart
would
break
do
you
remember
that
time
we
threw
little
bill
barnaby
into
the
swimming
hole
and
he
could
swim
a
stroke
and
nearly
drowned
on
us
and
still
getting
the
stony
face
from
his
old
pal
and
on
the
pier
this
dennen
held
out
his
hand
to
sam
who
was
a
physical
wreck
and
a
broken
man
by
this
time
and
says
sure
are
cute
mister
i
have
great
times
telling
this
in
readsboro
once
you
met
one
too
smart
for
ye
eh
much
obliged
for
your
company
anyhow
and
he
went
away
and
left
sam
leaning
against
the
railing
with
no
faith
in
human
nature
no
more
hope
somebody
got
to
him
says
sam
to
me
got
to
him
good
he
the
kind
that
if
you
work
right
you
can
sell
stock
in
a
company
for
starting
roof
gardens
on
the
tops
of
the
pyramids
in
egypt
i
trimmed
him
myself
says
sam
to
me
i
had
the
heart
max
finished
and
again
from
below
came
the
sound
of
voices
raised
in
anger
an
interesting
story
max
commented
professor
bolton
i
shall
treasure
it
told
with
a
remarkable
feeling
for
detail
added
magee
in
fact
it
seems
to
me
that
only
one
of
the
two
participants
in
it
could
remember
all
the
fine
points
so
well
max
you
do
exactly
look
like
mark
dennen
to
me
therefore
if
you
will
pardon
the
liberty
i
get
you
replied
max
sadly
the
same
old
story

does
a
lot
of
harm

me
i
would
he
jumped
from
his
chair
and
disappeared
for
the
voice
of
cargan
had
hailed
him
from
below
magee
and
the
professor
with
one
accord
followed
hiding
in
the
friendly
shadows
of
the
landing
once
again
they
heard
the
loud
tones
of
the
mayor
booming
voice
and
the
softer
tones
of
bland
how
about
this
bellowed
the
mayor
hayden
squealed

and
the
professor
turned
and
ascended
to
the
second
floor
in
front
of
number
seven
they
paused
and
looked
into
each
other
eyes
professor
bolton
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
going
to
bed
he
said
and
i
advise
you
to
do
the
same
yes
replied
magee
but
had
no
idea
what
he
had
said
as
for
the
old

he
had
no
intention
of
taking
it
melodrama
the
thing
he
had
come
to
baldpate
inn
to

raged
through
that
home
of
solitude
men
spoke
of
guns
and
swore
and
threatened
what
was
it
all
about
and
what
part
could
he
play
in
it
all
he
entered
number
seven
and
paused
in
amazement
outside
one
of
his
windows
miss
norton
stood
rapping
on
the
glass
for
him
to
open
when
he
stood
facing
her
at
last
the
window
no
longer
between
he
saw
that
her
face
was
very
pale
and
that
her
chin
trembled
as
it
had
in
the
station
what

the
girl
with
a
little
catch
in
her
voice
the
snow
lay
white
on
her
hair
even
in
the
shadows
her
eyes

june

some
people

he
went
into
the
room
and
put
on
a
gay
plaid
cap
makes
me
look
like
sherlock
holmes
he
smiled
at
the
girl
framed
in
the
window
when
he
turned
to
his
door
to
lock
it
he
discovered
that
the
key
was
gone
and
that
it
had
been
locked
on
the
outside
oh

well
he
said
flippantly
he
buttoned
his
coat
to
the
chin
blew
out
the
candles
in
number
seven
and
joined
the
girl
on
the
balcony

whispered

he
ran
to
the
end
of
the
balcony
and
dropping
softly
to
the
ground
was
ready
for
his
first
experiment
in
the
gentle
art
of
highway
robbery

no

crept
along
the
ground
close
to
the
veranda
the

down
upon
him

of
the
blackness

three
feet
ahead
the
world
seemed
to
end
a
corking
night
he
muttered
humorously
for
my
debut
in
the
business
he
swung
up
over
the
rail
on
to
the
veranda
and
walked
softly
along
it
until
he
came
to
a
window
opening
into
the
office
cautiously
he
peered
in
the
vast
lonely
room
was
lighted
by
a
single
candle
at
the
foot
of
the
broad
stair
he
could
discern
a
great
bulk
seated
on
the
lowest
step
which
he
correctly
took
to
be
the
mayor
of
reuton
back
of
the
desk
on
which
stood
the
candle
max
head
and
shoulders
were
visible
he
was
working
industriously
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
safe
door
occasionally
he
consulted
the
small
that
stood
on
the
desk
many
other
professions
had
claimed
max
before
his
advent
into
reuton
politics
evidently
he
was
putting
into
operation
the
training
acquired
in
one
of
them
mr
bland
was
nowhere
in
sight
shivering
with
cold
and
excitement
magee
leaned
against
the
side
of
baldpate
inn
and
waited
max
worked
eagerly
turning
frequently
to
his
bag
as
a
physician
might
turn
to
his
no
word
was
spoken
in
the
office
minutes
passed
the
bulk
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
surged
restlessly
max
operations
were
mostly
hidden
by
the
desk
at
which
in
summer
timid
old
ladies
inquired
for
their
mail
having
time
to
think
magee
pictured
the
horror
of
those
ladies
could
they
come
up
to
the
desk
at
baldpate
now
suddenly
max
ran
out
into
the
center
of
the
office
almost
on
the
instant
there
was
a
white
puff
of
smoke
and
a
roar
the
inn
seemed
about
to
roll
down
the
mountain
after
all
those
years
of
sticking
tight
the
mayor
looked
apprehensively
up
the
stair
behind
him
max
ran
to
the
open
safe
door
and
came
back
before
the
desk
with
a
package
in
his
hand
after
examining
it
hastily
cargan
placed
the
loot
in
his
pocket
the
greedy
eyes
of
max
followed
it
for
a
second
then
he
ran
over
and
gathered
up
his
tools
now
they
were
ready
to
depart
the
mayor
lifted
the
candle
from
the
desk
its
light
fell
on
a
big
chair
by
the
fire
and
magee
saw
in
that
chair
the
figure
of
mr
bland
bound
and
gagged
cargan
and
his
companion
paused
and
appeared
to
address
triumphant
and
jesting
comment
in
mr
bland
direction
then
they
buttoned
their
coats
and
holding
aloft
the
candle
disappeared
through
the
door
i
must
have
that
package
standing
on
the
balcony
of
baldpate
inn
her
yellow
hair
white
with
snow
her
eyes
shining
even
in
shadow
thus
had
the
lady
of
this
weird
drama
spoken
to
magee
and
gladly
he
had
undertaken
the
quest
now
he
knew
the
moment
had
come
to
act
max
he
could
quickly
dispose
of
he
felt
cargan
would
require
time
and
attention
he
hurried
round
to
the
front
door
of
the
inn
and
taking
the
big
key
from
his
pocket
unlocked
it
as
a
means
of
retreat
where
the
men
he
was
about
to
attack
could
not
follow
already
he
heard
their
muffled
steps
in
the
distance
crossing
the
veranda
he
dropped
down
into
the
snow
by
the
side
of
the
great
stone
steps
that
led
to
baldpate
inn
chief
entrance
he
heard
cargan
and
max
on
the
veranda
just
above
his
head
they
were
speaking
of
trains
to
reuton
in
great
good
humor
evidently
they
started
down
the
steps
magee
crouched
resolved
that
he
would
spring
the
moment
they
reached
the
ground
they
were
on
the
last
step
now
suddenly
from
the
other
side
of
the
steps
a
black
figure
rose
a
fist
shot
out
and
max
went
spinning
like
a
whirling
dervish
down
the
snowy
path
to
land
in
a
heap
five
feet
away
the
next
instant
the
mayor
of
reuton
and
the
black
figure
were
locked
in
terrific
conflict
magee
astounded
by
this
turn
of
affairs
could
only
stand
and
stare
through
the
dark
for
fifteen
seconds
muttering
slipping
grappling
the
two
figures
waltzed
grotesquely
about
in
the
falling
snow
then
the
mayor
feet
slid
from
under
him
on
the
treacherous
white
carpet
and
the
two
went
down
together
as
magee
swooped
down
upon
them
he
saw
the
hand
of
the
stranger
find
the
mayor
pocket
and
draw
from
it
the
package
that
had
been
placed
there
in
the
office
a
few
moments
before
unfortunately
for
the
demands
of
the
drama
in
which
he
had
become
involved
magee
had
never
been
an
athlete
at
the
university
but
he
was
a
young
man
of
average
strength
and
agility
and
he
had
the
advantage
of
landing
most
unexpectedly
on
his
antagonist
before
that
gentleman
realized
what
had
happened
magee
had
wrenched
the
package
from
his
hand
thrown
him
back
on
the
prostrate
form
of
the
highest
official
of
reuton
and
fled
up
the
steps
quickly
the
stranger
regained
his
feet
and
started
in
pursuit
but
he
arrived
at
the
great
front
door
of
baldpate
inn
just
in
time
to
hear
the
lock
click
inside
safe
for
the
moment
behind
a
locked
door
magee
paused
to
get
his
breath
the
glory
of
battle
filled
his
soul
it
was
not
until
long
afterward
that
he
realized
the
battle
had
been
a
mere
scuffle
in
the
dark
he
felt
his
cheeks
burn
with
excitement
like
a
sweet
girl
graduate
the
cheeks
of
a
man
who
had
always
prided
himself
he
was
the
unmoved
cynic
in
any
situation
with
no
thought
for
mr
bland
bound
in
his
uneasy
chair
magee
hurried
up
the
broad
staircase
of
baldpate
now
came
the
most
gorgeous
scene
of
all
a
lady
a
knight
she
had
sent
forth
to
battle
the
knight
returned
you
asked
me
to
bring
you
this
my
lady
business
of
surprise
and
joy
on
the
lady
part
business
also
perhaps
of
adoration
for
the
knight
at
the
right
of
the
stairs
lay
seventeen
and
the
lady
at
the
left
a
supposedly
uninhabited
land
as
magee
reached
the
second
floor
blithely
picturing
the
scene
in
which
he
was
to
play
so
satisfactory
a
part
he
paused
for
down
the
corridor
to
the
left
an
open
door
threw
a
faint
light
into
the
hall
and
in
that
light
stood
a
woman
he
had
never
seen
before
in
this
order
came
magee
impressions
of
her
tall
dark
handsome
with
the
haughty
manner
of
one
engaging
a
chauffeur
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
but
are
you
by
any
chance
mr
magee
the
knight
leaned
weakly
against
the
wall
and
tried
to
think
i
i
am
he
managed
to
say
i
so
glad
i
found
you
replied
the
girl
it
seemed
to
the
dazed
magee
that
her
dark
eyes
were
not
overly
happy
i
can
not
ask
you
in
i
afraid
i
do
not
know
the
custom
on
such
an
occasion
does
anybody
i
am
alone
with
my
maid
hal
bentley
when
i
wrote
to
him
for
a
key
to
this
place
told
me
of
your
being
here
and
said
that
i
was
to
put
myself
under
your
protection
magee
arranged
a
bow
most
of
which
was
lost
in
the
dark
delighted
i
sure
he
murmured
i
shall
try
not
to
impose
on
you
she
went
on
the
whole
affair
is
so
unusual
as
to
be
almost
absurd
but
bentley
said
that
you
were
very
kind
he
said
i
might
trust
you
i
am
in
great
trouble
i
have
come
here
to
get
something
and
i
have
the
least
idea
how
to
proceed
i
came
because
i
must
have
it
so
much
depends
on
it
prophetically
magee
clutched
in
his
pocket
the
package
for
which
he
had
done
battle
i
may
be
too
late
the
girl
eyes
grew
wide
that
would
be
terribly
unfortunate
i
do
not
wish
you
to
be
injured
serving
me
she
lowered
her
voice
but
if
there
is
any
way
in
which
you
can
help
me
in
in
this
difficulty
i
can
never
be
grateful
enough
in
the
safe
there
is
i
believe
a
package
containing
a
large
sum
of
money
magee
hand
closed
convulsively
in
his
pocket
if
there
is
any
way
possible
said
the
girl
i
must
obtain
that
package
i
give
you
my
word
i
have
as
much
right
to
it
as
any
one
who
will
appear
at
the
inn
the
honor
and
happiness
of
one
who
is
very
dear
to
me
is
involved
i
ask
you
made
bold
as
i
am
by
my
desperation
and
hal
bentley
assurances
to
aid
me
if
you
find
you
can
with
the
eyes
of
a
man
in
a
dream
magee
looked
into
the
face
of
the
latest
comer
to
baldpate
hal
bentley
is
an
old
friend
and
a
bully
chap
he
said
it
will
be
a
great
pleasure
to
serve
a
friend
of
his
he
paused
congratulating
himself
that
these
were
words
idle
words
when
did
you
arrive
may
i
ask
i
believe
you
were
having
dinner
when
i
came
she
answered
bentley
gave
me
a
key
to
the
kitchen
door
and
we
found
a
back
stairway
there
seemed
to
be
a
company
below
i
wanted
to
see
only
you
i
repeat
said
magee
i
shall
be
happy
to
help
you
if
i
can
his
word
to
another
lady
he
reflected
was
binding
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
harm
in
waiting
until
morning
but
i
am
afraid
it
was
she
began
i
understand
magee
replied
the
plans
went
wrong
you
may
safely
let
your
worries
rest
until
he
was
on
the
point
of
adding
something
about
relying
on
him
but
remembered
in
time
which
girl
he
was
addressing
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
make
you
more
comfortable
the
girl
drew
the
fur
coat
closer
about
her
shoulders
she
suggested
to
magee
a
sheltered
luxurious
life
he
could
see
her
regaling
young
men
with
tea
before
a
fireplace
in
a
beautiful
room
insipid
tea
in
cups
you
are
very
kind
she
said
i
hardly
expected
to
be
here
the
night
through
it
is
rather
cold
but
i
am
sure
we
have
rugs
and
coats
enough
magee
duty
was
clear
i
build
you
a
fire
he
announced
the
girl
seemed
distressed
at
the
thought
no
i
could
let
you
she
said
i
am
sure
it
is
necessary
i
will
say
good
night
now
good
night
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
i
shall
tell
you
she
finished
smiling
i
believe
i
forgot
to
give
you
my
name
i
am
myra
thornhill
of
reuton
until
she
went
in
and
closed
the
door
magee
sat
limply
down
on
the
cold
stair
all
the
glory
was
gone
from
the
scene
he
had
pictured
a
moment
ago
he
had
the
money
yes
the
money
procured
in
valiant
battle
but
at
the
moment
he
bore
the
prize
to
his
lady
another
appeared
from
the
dark
to
claim
it
what
should
he
do
he
got
up
and
started
for
number
seventeen
the
girl
who
waited
there
was
very
charming
and
attractive
but
what
did
he
know
about
her
what
did
she
want
with
this
money
he
paused
this
other
girl
came
from
hal
bentley
a
friend
of
friends
and
she
claimed
to
have
every
right
to
this
precious
package
what
were
her
exact
words
why
not
wait
until
morning
perhaps
in
the
cold
gray
dawn
he
would
see
more
clearly
his
way
through
this
preposterous
tangle
anyhow
it
would
be
dangerous
to
give
into
any
woman
keeping
just
then
a
package
so
earnestly
sought
by
desperate
men
yes
he
would
wait
until
morning
that
was
the
only
reasonable
course
reasonable
that
was
the
word
he
used
a
knight
prating
of
the
reasonable
magee
unlocked
the
door
of
number
seven
and
entered
lighting
his
candles
and
prodding
the
fire
he
composed
a
note
to
the
waiting
girl
in
seventeen
everything
all
right
sleep
peacefully
i
am
on
the
job
will
see
you
billy
slipping
this
message
under
her
door
the
hurried
away
to
avoid
an
interview
and
sat
down
in
his
chair
before
the
fire
i
must
think
he
muttered
i
must
get
this
thing
straight
for
an
hour
he
pondered
threshing
out
as
best
he
could
this
mysterious
game
in
which
he
played
a
leading
part
unequipped
with
a
book
of
rules
he
went
back
to
the
very
beginning
even
to
the
station
at
upper
asquewan
falls
where
the
undeniable
charm
of
the
first
of
these
girls
had
won
him
completely
he
reviewed
the
arrival
of
bland
and
his
babble
of
haberdashery
of
professor
bolton
and
his
weird
tale
of
peroxide
blondes
and
suffragettes
of
miss
norton
and
her
impossible
mother
of
cargan
hater
of
reformers
and
lou
max
foe
of
suspicion
he
thought
of
the
figure
in
the
dark
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
that
had
fought
so
savagely
for
the
package
now
in
his
own
pocket
of
the
girl
who
had
pleaded
so
convincingly
on
the
balcony
for
his
help
of
the
colder
more
sophisticated
woman
who
came
with
hal
bentley
authority
to
ask
of
him
the
same
favor
myra
thornhill
he
had
heard
the
name
surely
but
where
magee
thoughts
went
back
to
new
york
he
wondered
what
they
would
say
if
they
could
see
him
now
whirling
about
in
a
queer
romance
not
of
his
own
writing
he
who
had
come
to
baldpate
inn
to
get
away
from
mere
romancing
and
look
into
men
hearts
a
philosopher
he
laughed
out
loud
is
another
day
he
reflected
i
solve
this
whole
thing
then
they
ca
go
on
playing
without
me
i
got
the
ball
he
took
the
package
from
his
pocket
its
seals
had
already
been
broken
untying
the
strings
he
began
carefully
to
unwrap
the
paper
the
thick
yellow
banking
manila
and
then
the
oiled
inner
wrapping
so
finally
he
opened
up
the
solid
mass
of
what
he
looked
closer
crisp
beautiful
one
thousand
dollar
bills
whew
he
had
never
seen
a
bill
of
this
size
before
and
here
were
two
hundred
of
them
he
wrapped
the
package
up
once
more
and
prepared
for
bed
just
as
he
was
about
to
retire
he
remembered
mr
bland
bound
and
gagged
below
he
went
into
the
hall
with
the
idea
of
releasing
the
unlucky
haberdasher
but
from
the
office
rose
the
voices
of
the
mayor
max
and
bland
himself
peace
evidently
had
been
declared
between
them
magee
returned
to
number
seven
locked
all
the
windows
placed
the
package
beneath
his
pillow
and
after
a
of
puzzling
and
tossing
fell
asleep
it
was
still
quite
dark
when
he
awoke
with
a
start
in
the
blackness
he
could
make
out
a
figure
standing
by
the
side
of
his
bed
he
put
his
hand
quickly
beneath
his
pillow
the
package
was
still
there
what
do
you
want
he
asked
sitting
up
in
bed
for
answer
the
intruder
sprang
through
the
door
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
of
the
outer
room
magee
followed
one
of
his
windows
slammed
back
and
forth
in
the
wind
slipping
on
a
and
lighting
a
candle
he
made
an
investigation
the
glass
above
the
lock
had
been
broken
outside
in
the
snow
on
the
balcony
were
recent
footprints
sleepily
magee
procured
the
precious
package
and
put
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
gown
then
drawing
on
his
shoes
he
added
a
greatcoat
to
his
equipment
took
a
candle
and
went
out
on
to
the
balcony
the
storm
had
increased
the
snow
flurried
and
blustered
the
windows
of
baldpate
inn
rattled
wildly
all
about
it
was
difficult
to
keep
the
candle
burning
in
that
wind
magee
followed
the
footprints
along
the
east
side
of
the
inn
to
the
corner
then
along
the
more
sheltered
rear
and
finally
to
the
west
side
on
the
west
was
a
rather
unlovely
annex
to
the
main
building
which
increasing
patronage
had
made
necessary
it
was
connected
with
the
inn
by
a
covered
passageway
from
the
second
floor
balcony
at
the
entrance
to
this
passageway
the
footprints
stopped
entering
the
dark
passageway
magee
made
his
way
to
the
door
of
the
annex
he
tried
it
it
was
locked
but
as
he
turned
away
he
heard
voices
on
the
other
side
magee
had
barely
enough
time
to
extinguish
his
candle
and
slip
into
the
shadows
of
the
corner
the
door
of
the
annex
opened
a
man
stepped
out
into
the
passageway
he
stood
there
the
light
from
a
candle
held
by
some
one
in
the
doorway
whom
magee
could
not
see
fell
full
upon
his
face
the
bespectacled
wise
face
of
professor
thaddeus
bolton
better
luck
next
time
said
the
professor
keep
an
eye
an
him
said
the
voice
from
inside
if
he
tries
to
leave
the
inn
there
be
a
big
row
we
must
be
in
on
it
and
win
i
imagine
said
professor
bolton
smiling
his
academic
smile
that
the
inmates
of
baldpate
will
make
a
rather
interesting
day
for
him
it
will
be
an
interesting
day
for
every
one
answered
the
voice
if
i
should
manage
to
secure
the
package
by
any
chance
the
professor
went
on
i
shall
undoubtedly
need
your
help
in
getting
away
with
it
let
us
arrange
a
signal
should
a
window
of
my
room
be
open
at
any
time
you
will
know
the
money
is
in
my
hands
very
good
replied
the
other
good
night
and
good
luck
the
same
to
you
answered
professor
bolton
the
door
was
closed
and
the
old
man
moved
off
down
the
passageway
after
him
crept
magee
he
followed
the
professor
to
the
east
balcony
and
saw
him
pause
at
the
open
window
of
number
seven
there
the
old
man
looked
slyly
about
as
though
in
doubt
he
peered
into
the
room
and
one
foot
was
across
the
sill
when
magee
came
up
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
professor
bolton
leaped
in
evident
fright
out
upon
the
balcony
it
it
a
wonderful
night
he
said
i
was
out
for
a
little
walk
on
the
balcony
enjoying
it
seeing
your
open
window
i
was
afraid
the
night
you
speak
so
highly
of
replied
magee
is
at
your
left
you
have
lost
your
way
good
night
professor
he
stepped
inside
and
closed
the
window
then
he
pulled
down
the
curtains
in
both
rooms
of
his
suite
and
spent
some
time
exploring
finally
he
paused
before
the
fireplace
and
with
the
aid
of
a
knife
unloosed
a
brick
under
this
he
placed
the
package
of
money
removing
the
traces
of
his
act
as
best
he
could
now
he
said
standing
up
i
a
regular
hermit
with
a
buried
treasure
as
per
all
hermit
specifications
i
going
to
hand
my
treasure
to
somebody
it
too
much
for
a
man
who
came
up
here
to
escape
the
excitement
and
melodrama
of
the
world
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
past
three
entering
the
inner
room
for
the
second
time
that
night
he
sought
to
sleep
they
play
without
me
i
got
the
ball
he
repeated
with
a
smile
and
safe
in
this
thought
he
closed
his
eyes
and
slumbered
chapter
x
the
cold
gray
dawn
the
gayest
knight
must
have
a
morning
after
magee
awakened
to
his
to
find
suite
seven
wrapped
again
in
its
favorite
polar
atmosphere
filling
the
door
leading
to
the
outer
room
he
beheld
the
cause
of
his
awakening
the
mayor
of
reuton
cargan
regarded
him
with
the
cold
steely
eye
of
a
disraeli
in
action
but
when
he
spoke
he
opened
the
jaws
of
a
cocktail
mixer
well
young
fellow
he
remarked
it
seems
to
me
it
was
time
you
got
up
and
faced
the
responsibilities
of
the
day
first
of
which
i
may
mention
is
a
little
talk
with
me
he
stepped
into
the
room
and
through
the
doorway
he
vacated
max
came
slinking
the
unlovely
face
of
the
foe
of
suspicion
was
badly
bruised
and
he
looked
upon
the
world
with
no
cheerful
eye
pushing
aside
one
of
the
frail
bedroom
chairs
as
untrustworthy
the
mayor
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
magee
bed
it
creaked
in
protest
you
used
us
pretty
rough
last
night
in
the
snow
cargan
went
on
that
why
i
ai
disposed
to
go
in
for
kid
gloves
and
diplomacy
this
morning
it
my
experience
that
when
you
dealing
with
a
man
got
the
good
old
irish
name
of
magee
it
best
to
hit
first
and
debate
afterward
i
i
used
you
roughly
mr
cargan
said
magee
no
debate
mind
you
protested
the
mayor
lou
and
me
are
making
this
morning
call
to
inquire
after
a
little
package
that
went
astray
somewhere
last
night
there
two
courses
open
to
you
hand
over
the
package
or
let
us
take
it
i
give
you
a
tip
the
first
is
the
best
if
we
have
to
take
it
we
might
get
real
rough
in
our
actions
max
slipped
closer
to
the
bed
an
ugly
look
on
his
face
the
mayor
glared
fixedly
into
magee
eyes
the
knight
who
fought
for
fair
ladies
in
the
snow
lay
on
his
pillow
and
considered
briefly
i
get
what
i
go
after
remarked
cargan
emphatically
yes
sparred
magee
but
the
real
point
is
keeping
what
you
get
after
you
gone
after
it
you
did
make
much
of
an
impression
on
me
last
night
in
that
line
mr
cargan
i
never
cared
much
for
humor
replied
the
mayor
especially
at
this
early
hour
of
the
morning
and
i
hate
a
fresh
guy
put
in
max
like
poison
i
not
fresh
magee
smiled
i
stating
facts
you
say
come
for
that
package
all
right
but
you
come
to
the
wrong
room
i
have
got
it
the
hell
you
have
roared
the
mayor
lou
look
about
a
bit
look
about
all
you
like
agreed
magee
you
wo
find
it
cargan
i
admit
that
i
laid
for
you
last
night
i
saw
you
open
the
safe
according
to
the
latest
approved
methods
and
i
saw
you
come
forth
with
a
package
of
money
but
i
was
rough
with
you
i
might
have
been
to
be
frank
but
somebody
beat
me
to
it
who
the
man
with
the
seventh
key
i
suppose
the
man
bland
heard
walking
about
last
night
when
we
were
at
dinner
do
tell
me
you
did
see
him
in
that
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
well
i
did
think
there
was
another
guy
the
mayor
answered
but
lou
said
i
was
crazy
lou
does
you
an
injustice
there
was
another
guy
and
if
you
are
anxious
to
recover
your
precious
package
i
advise
you
to
wake
him
up
to
the
responsibilities
of
the
day
not
me
the
mayor
considered
max
who
had
hastily
made
the
rounds
of
the
three
rooms
came
back
with
empty
hands
well
said
the
mayor
i
might
as
well
admit
it
i
up
in
the
air
i
do
know
just
at
this
minute
where
to
get
off
but
that
state
of
affairs
do
last
long
with
me
young
fellow
i
go
to
the
bottom
of
this
before
the
day
is
out
believe
me
and
if
i
ca
do
anything
else
i
take
you
back
to
reuton
myself
and
throw
you
in
jail
for
robbery
i
would
do
that
smiled
magee
think
of
the
awful
job
of
explaining
to
the
white
necktie
crowd
how
you
happened
to
be
dynamiting
a
safe
on
baldpate
mountain
at
midnight
oh
i
guess
i
can
get
around
that
said
the
mayor
that
money
belongs
to
a
friend
of
mine
andy
rutter
i
happen
to
go
to
the
inn
for
a
little
rest
and
i
grab
you
dynamiting
the
safe
i
keep
an
eye
on
you
magee
and
let
me
tell
you
now
that
if
i
catch
you
or
any
of
the
bunch
that
with
you
trying
to
make
a
getaway
from
baldpate
there
going
to
be
a
war
break
out
i
do
know
about
the
other
hermits
laughed
magee
but
personally
i
expect
to
be
here
for
several
weeks
to
come
whew
it
cold
in
here
where
the
hermit
why
has
he
been
up
to
fix
my
fire
yes
where
is
he
repeated
cargan
that
what
everybody
like
to
know
he
has
showed
up
not
a
sign
of
breakfast
and
me
as
hollow
as
a
reformer
victory
he
backslid
cried
magee
the
quitter
sneered
max
it
only
a
quitter
would
live
on
the
mountain
in
a
shack
anyhow
you
rather
hard
on
poor
old
peters
remarked
magee
but
when
i
think
that
i
have
to
get
up
and
dress
in
a
refrigerating
plant
i
say
i
blame
you
if
only
the
fire
were
lighted
he
smiled
his
most
ingratiating
smile
on
his
companion
by
the
way
cargan
you
up
and
dressed
i
read
a
lot
of
magazine
articles
about
you
and
they
one
and
all
agree
that
you
a
good
fellow
you
find
kindling
and
paper
beside
the
hearth
what
the
mayor
roar
seemed
to
shake
the
windows
young
man
with
a
nerve
like
yours
you
could
wheedle
the
price
of
a
battleship
from
carnegie
i
i
he
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
almost
in
awe
at
magee
then
he
burst
forth
into
a
laugh
i
am
a
good
fellow
he
said
i
show
you
he
went
into
the
other
room
and
despite
the
horrified
protests
of
lou
max
busied
himself
amid
the
ashes
of
the
fireplace
when
he
had
a
blaze
under
way
magee
came
shivering
from
the
other
room
and
held
out
his
hand
cargan
he
laughed
you
a
prince
he
noted
with
interest
that
the
mayor
broad
shoes
were
mighty
near
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
while
magee
drew
on
his
clothes
the
mayor
and
max
sat
thoughtfully
before
the
fire
the
former
with
his
pudgy
hands
folded
over
the
vast
expanse
where
no
breakfast
reposed
magee
explained
to
them
that
the
holder
of
the
sixth
key
had
arrived
a
handsome
young
lady
he
remarked
her
name
is
myra
thornhill
old
henry
thornhill
daughter
reflected
the
mayor
well
seems
sort
of
lost
the
habit
of
being
surprised
now
i
tell
you
lou
breaking
into
the
orchid
division
up
here
while
magee
shaved
in
water
another
black
mark
against
the
hermit
of
baldpate
he
turned
over
in
his
mind
the
events
of
the
night
before
the
vigil
in
the
office
the
pleading
of
the
fair
girl
on
the
balcony
the
battle
by
the
steps
the
sudden
appearance
of
miss
thornhill
the
figure
in
his
room
the
conversation
by
the
annex
door
like
a
moving
picture
film
the
story
of
that
weird
night
unrolled
itself
the
film
was
not
yet
at
an
end
he
had
given
himself
the
night
to
think
soon
he
would
stand
before
the
girl
of
the
station
soon
he
must
answer
her
questions
what
was
he
to
do
with
the
fortune
that
lay
beneath
the
feet
of
the
mayor
of
reuton
at
this
minute
he
hardly
knew
he
was
ready
to
descend
at
last
and
came
into
the
parlor
of
his
suite
with
greatcoat
and
hat
in
reply
to
cargan
unasked
question
he
said
i
going
up
the
mountain
presently
to
reason
with
our
striking
cook
you
ai
going
to
leave
this
inn
magee
said
the
mayor
not
even
to
bring
back
a
cook
come
cargan
be
reasonable
you
may
go
with
me
if
you
suspect
my
motives
they
went
out
into
the
hall
and
magee
passed
down
the
corridor
to
the
farther
end
where
he
rapped
on
the
door
of
miss
thornhill
room
she
appeared
almost
immediately
buried
beneath
furs
and
wraps
you
must
be
nearly
frozen
remarked
magee
pityingly
you
and
your
maid
come
down
to
the
office
i
want
you
to
meet
the
other
guests
i
come
she
replied
magee
i
a
confession
to
make
i
invented
the
maid
it
seemed
so
horribly
unconventional
and
shocking
i
could
admit
that
i
was
alone
that
was
why
i
would
let
you
build
a
fire
for
me
do
worry
smiled
magee
you
find
we
have
all
the
conveniences
up
here
i
present
you
to
a
chaperon
shortly
a
norton
who
is
here
with
her
daughter
allow
me
to
introduce
cargan
and
mr
max
the
girl
bowed
with
a
rather
startled
air
and
cargan
mumbled
something
that
had
pleasure
in
it
in
the
office
they
found
professor
bolton
and
mr
bland
sitting
gloomily
before
the
fireplace
got
the
news
magee
asked
the
haberdasher
peters
has
done
a
disappearing
act
it
was
evident
to
magee
that
everybody
looked
upon
peters
as
his
creature
and
laid
the
hermit
sins
at
his
door
he
laughed
i
going
to
head
a
search
party
shortly
he
said
do
i
detect
the
odor
of
coffee
in
the
distance
norton
remarked
professor
bolton
dolefully
has
kindly
consented
to
do
what
she
can
the
girl
of
the
station
came
through
the
door
it
was
evident
she
had
no
share
in
the
general
gloom
that
the
hermit
absence
cast
over
baldpate
her
eyes
were
bright
with
the
glories
of
morning
on
a
mountain
in
their
depths
there
was
no
room
for
petty
annoyances
good
morning
she
said
to
magee
is
it
bracing
have
you
been
outside
oh
i
miss
norton
miss
thornhill
explained
magee
miss
thornhill
has
the
sixth
key
you
know
she
came
last
night
without
any
of
us
knowing
with
lukewarm
smiles
the
two
girls
shook
hands
outwardly
the
glances
they
exchanged
were
nonchalant
and
casual
but
somehow
magee
felt
that
among
the
matters
they
established
were
social
position
wit
cunning
guile
and
taste
in
dress
may
i
help
with
the
coffee
asked
miss
thornhill
only
to
drink
it
replied
the
girl
of
the
station
it
all
made
now
you
see
as
if
in
proof
of
this
norton
appeared
in
the
door
with
a
tray
and
simultaneously
opened
an
endless
monologue
i
do
know
what
you
men
will
say
to
this
i
sure
nothing
in
the
house
but
some
coffee
and
a
few
crackers
not
even
any
canned
soup
and
i
thought
from
the
way
things
went
yesterday
he
had
ten
thousand
cans
of
it
at
the
very
least
but
men
are
all
alike
what
name
did
you
say
oh
yes
miss
thornhill
pleased
to
meet
you
i
sure
excuse
my
not
shaking
hands
as
i
was
saying
men
are
all
alike
norton
thought
if
he
brought
home
a
roast
on
saturday
night
it
ought
to
last
the
week
out
she
rattled
on
unheeding
her
flow
of
talk
the
hermits
of
baldpate
inn
swallowed
the
coffee
she
offered
when
the
rather
unsatisfactory
substitute
for
breakfast
was
consumed
magee
rose
briskly
now
he
said
i
going
to
run
up
to
the
hermit
shack
and
reason
with
him
as
best
i
can
i
shall
paint
in
touching
colors
our
sad
plight
if
the
man
has
an
atom
of
decency
a
walk
on
the
mountain
in
the
morning
said
miss
thornhill
quickly
splendid
i
wonderful
put
in
miss
norton
i
for
one
ca
resist
even
though
i
have
been
invited
i
going
along
she
smiled
sweetly
she
had
beaten
the
other
girl
by
the
breadth
of
a
hair
and
she
knew
it
new
glories
shone
in
her
eyes
good
for
you
said
magee
the
evil
hour
of
explanations
was
at
hand
surely
run
up
and
get
your
things
while
miss
norton
was
gone
cargan
and
lou
max
engaged
in
earnest
converse
near
a
window
after
which
max
pulled
on
his
overcoat
i
ai
been
invited
either
he
said
but
i
reckon
i
go
along
i
always
wanted
to
see
what
a
hermit
lived
like
when
he
really
buckled
down
to
the
hermit
business
and
then
a
walk
in
the
morning
has
always
been
my
first
rule
for
health
you
do
mind
do
you
who
am
i
asked
magee
that
i
should
stand
between
you
and
health
come
along
by
all
means
with
the
blue
corduroy
suit
again
complete
and
the
saucy
hat
perched
on
her
blond
head
miss
norton
ran
down
the
stairs
and
received
the
news
that
max
also
was
enthralled
by
the
possibilities
of
a
walk
up
baldpate
the
three
went
out
through
the
front
door
and
found
under
the
snow
a
hint
of
the
path
that
led
to
the
shack
of
the
merchant
will
you
go
ahead
asked
magee
of
max
sorry
grinned
max
but
i
guess
i
bring
up
the
rear
suspicion
said
magee
shaking
his
head
has
caused
a
lot
of
trouble
in
the
world
remember
the
cruelty
practised
on
pueblo
sam
i
do
replied
max
and
it
nearly
breaks
my
heart
but
there
a
little
matter
i
forgot
to
mention
last
night
suspicion
is
all
right
in
its
place
where
that
asked
magee
max
tapped
his
narrow
chest
here
he
said
so
the
three
began
the
climb
magee
and
the
girl
ahead
max
leering
at
their
heels
the
snow
still
fell
and
the
picture
of
the
world
was
painted
in
grays
and
whites
at
some
points
along
the
way
to
the
hermit
abode
it
had
drifted
deep
at
others
the
was
swept
almost
bare
by
the
wind
for
a
time
max
kept
so
close
that
the
conversation
of
the
two
in
the
lead
was
necessarily
of
the
commonplaces
of
the
wind
and
sky
and
mountain
covertly
magee
glanced
at
the
girl
striding
along
by
his
side
the
red
flamed
in
her
cheeks
her
long
lashes
were
flecked
with
the
white
of
the
snow
her
face
was
such
a
one
as
men
dream
of
while
their
fat
wives
read
the
evening
paper
beauty
hints
at
their
side
far
beyond
the
ordinary
woman
was
she
desirable
and
pleasing
magee
told
himself
he
had
been
a
fool
for
he
who
had
fought
so
valiantly
for
her
heart
desire
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
had
faltered
when
the
time
came
to
hand
her
the
prize
why
what
place
had
caution
in
the
wild
scheme
of
the
night
before
none
surely
and
yet
he
dolt
idiot
coward
had
in
the
moment
of
triumph
turned
cautious
full
confession
he
decided
was
the
only
way
out
max
was
panting
along
quite
ten
feet
behind
over
her
shoulder
the
girl
noted
this
she
turned
her
questioning
eyes
on
magee
he
felt
that
his
moment
had
come
i
do
know
how
to
begin
muttered
the
novelist
whose
speeches
had
always
been
so
apt
last
night
you
sent
me
on
a
sort
of
quest
for
the
golden
fleece
i
did
know
who
had
been
fleeced
or
what
the
idea
was
but
i
fared
forth
as
they
say
i
got
it
for
you
the
eyes
of
the
girl
glowed
happily
she
was
beaming
i
so
glad
she
said
but
why
why
did
you
give
it
to
me
last
night
it
would
have
meant
so
much
if
you
had
that
replied
magee
is
what
i
coming
to
very
reluctantly
did
you
note
any
spirit
of
caution
in
the
fellow
who
set
forth
on
your
quest
and
dropped
over
the
balcony
rail
you
did
not
i
waited
on
the
porch
and
saw
max
tap
the
safe
i
saw
him
and
cargan
come
out
i
waited
for
them
just
as
i
was
about
to
jump
on
them
somebody
the
man
with
the
seventh
key
i
guess
did
it
for
me
there
was
a
scuffle
i
joined
it
i
emerged
with
the
package
everybody
seems
so
interested
in
yes
said
the
girl
breathlessly
and
then
i
started
to
bring
it
to
you
went
on
magee
glancing
over
his
shoulder
at
max
i
was
all
aglow
with
romance
and
battle
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
pictured
the
thrill
of
handing
you
the
thing
you
had
asked
i
ran
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
i
saw
her
the
light
died
in
her
eyes
reproach
entered
there
yes
continued
magee
your
knight
errant
lost
his
nerve
he
ceased
to
run
on
schedule
she
too
asked
me
for
that
package
of
money
and
you
gave
it
to
her
said
the
girl
scornfully
oh
no
answered
magee
quickly
not
so
bad
as
that
i
simply
sat
down
on
the
steps
and
thought
i
got
cautious
i
decided
to
wait
until
i
i
did
wait
he
paused
the
girl
strode
on
looking
straight
ahead
magee
thought
of
adding
that
he
had
felt
it
might
be
dangerous
to
place
a
package
so
voraciously
desired
in
her
frail
hands
he
decided
he
better
not
on
second
thought
i
know
he
said
what
you
think
i
a
fine
specimen
of
a
man
to
send
on
a
hunt
like
that
a
mollycoddle
who
passes
into
a
state
of
coma
at
the
crucial
moment
but
i
going
to
give
you
that
package
yet
the
girl
turned
her
head
magee
saw
that
her
eyes
were
misty
with
tears
you
playing
with
me
she
said
brokenly
i
might
have
known
and
i
trusted
you
you
in
the
game
with
the
others
and
i
thought
you
were
i
staked
my
whole
chance
of
success
on
you
now
you
making
sport
of
me
you
never
intended
to
give
me
that
money
you
do
intend
to
now
on
my
word
cried
magee
i
do
intend
to
give
it
to
you
the
minute
we
get
back
to
the
inn
i
have
it
safe
in
my
room
give
it
to
her
said
the
girl
bitterly
why
do
you
give
it
to
her
oh
the
perversity
of
women
it
you
i
want
to
give
it
to
replied
magee
warmly
i
do
know
what
was
the
matter
with
me
last
night
i
was
a
fool
you
do
believe
in
me
i
know
her
face
was
cold
and
expressionless
and
i
wanted
to
believe
in
you
so
much
she
said
why
did
you
want
to
cried
magee
why
she
plodded
on
through
the
snow
you
must
believe
he
pleaded
i
do
know
what
all
this
is
about
on
my
word
of
honor
but
i
want
to
give
you
that
money
and
i
will
the
minute
we
get
back
to
the
inn
will
you
believe
then
will
you
i
hate
you
said
the
girl
simply
she
should
not
have
said
that
as
far
back
as
he
could
remember
such
opposition
had
stirred
magee
to
wild
deeds
he
opened
his
mouth
and
words
flowed
forth
what
were
the
words
i
love
you
i
love
you
ever
since
that
moment
in
the
station
i
have
loved
you
i
love
you
faintly
he
heard
himself
saying
it
over
and
over
by
the
gods
he
was
proposing
inanely
in
words
of
one
syllable
as
the
butcher
boy
might
have
told
his
love
to
the
second
kitchen
maid
i
love
you
he
continued
idiot
often
magee
had
thought
of
the
moment
when
he
would
tell
his
love
to
a
woman
it
was
a
moment
of
dim
lights
music
perhaps
in
the
distance
two
souls
caught
up
in
the
magic
of
the
moonlit
night
a
pretty
graceful
speech
from
him
a
sweet
gracious
surrender
from
the
girl
and
this
instead
i
love
you
in
heaven
name
was
he
never
going
to
stop
saying
it
i
want
you
to
believe
bright
morning
on
the
mountain
a
girl
in
an
angry
mood
at
his
side
a
seedy
chaperon
on
his
trail
an
erring
cook
ahead
good
lord
he
recalled
that
a
fellow
novelist
whose
love
scenes
were
regarded
as
models
by
young
people
suffering
the
tender
passion
had
once
confessed
that
he
proposed
to
his
wife
on
a
and
was
accepted
just
as
the
conductor
handed
him
his
transfers
magee
had
been
scornful
he
could
never
be
scornful
again
by
a
tremendous
effort
he
avoided
repeating
his
childish
refrain
the
girl
deliberately
stopped
there
was
never
less
of
sweet
gracious
surrender
in
a
suffragette
hurling
a
stone
through
a
window
she
eyed
magee
pityingly
and
they
stood
until
max
caught
up
with
them
so
that
the
hermit
shack
said
max
indicating
the
little
wooden
hut
at
which
they
had
arrived
a
funny
place
for
a
guy
to
bury
himself
i
should
think
he
get
to
longing
for
the
white
lights
and
the
table
with
red
wine
a
very
unromantic
speech
reproved
the
girl
you
should
be
deeply
thrilled
at
the
thought
of
penetrating
the
secrets
of
the
hermitage
i
am
are
you
mr
magee
she
smiled
up
at
magee
and
he
was
in
that
state
where
he
thought
that
in
the
blue
depths
of
her
eyes
he
saw
the
sunny
slopes
of
the
islands
of
the
blest
i
he
caught
himself
in
time
he
would
not
be
idiot
enough
to
babble
it
again
he
pulled
himself
together
i
going
to
make
you
believe
in
me
he
said
with
a
touch
of
his
old
jauntiness
max
was
knocking
with
characteristic
loudness
at
the
hermit
door
chapter
xi
a
falsehood

the
palms
make
me
a
willow
cabin
at
your
gate
quoted
magee
looking
at
the
hermit
shack
with
interest
replied
miss
norton
thus
beautiful
sentiments
frequently
fare
even
at
the
hands
of
the
most
beautiful
magee
abandoned
his
project
of
completing
the
speech
the
door
of
the
hermit
abode
opened
before
max
masterful
knock
and
the
bearded
little
man
appeared
on
the
threshold
he
was
clad
in
a
purple
that
suggested
some
woman
had
picked
it
surely
no
man
could
have
fallen
victim
to
that
riot
of
color
come
in
said
the
hermit
in
a
tone
so
colorless
it
called
added
attention
to
the
gown
miss
you
have
the
chair
you
have
to
be
contented
with
that
davenport
gentlemen
well
he
stood
facing
them
in
the
middle
of
his
hermitage
with
curious
eyes
they
examined
its
architecture
exiled
hands
had
built
it
of
poles
and
clay
and
a
reliable
brand
of
roofing
in
the
largest
room
where
they
sat
were
chairs
a
table
and
a
hammered
together
from
stray
boards
furniture
midway
between
that
in
a
hut
on
a
desert
isle
and
that
of
a
home
made
happy
from
the
back
pages
of
a
woman
magazine
on
the
wall
were
various
posters
that
defined
the
hermit
taste
in
art
as
inflammatory
bold
arresting
through
one
door
at
the
rear
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
tiny
kitchen
through
another
the
white
covering
of
a
cot
could
be
seen
well
repeated
peters
i
suppose
you
a
delegation
so
to
speak
a
cold
unfeeling
word
objected
magee
we
have
come
to
plead
began
miss
norton
turning
her
eyes
at
their
full
on
the
hermit
bearded
face
i
beg
pardon
miss
interrupted
peters
but
it
ai
any
use
i
thought
it
all
out
in
the
night
watches
as
the
poet
says
i
came
up
here
to
be
alone
i
ca
be
a
hermit
and
a
cook
too
i
ca
and
be
true
to
myself
no
you
have
to
accept
my
resignation
to
take
effect
at
once
he
sat
down
on
an
uncertain
chair
and
regarded
them
sorrowfully
his
long
fingers
clutched
the
cord
of
the
purple
gown
it
is
as
though
we
were
asking
you
to
give
up
the
hermit
business
for
good
argued
magee
it
just
for
a
short
time
maybe
only
for
a
few
days
i
should
think
you
would
welcome
the
diversion
peters
shook
his
head
vigorously
the
brown
curls
waved
flippantly
about
his
shoulders
my
instincts
he
replied
are
away
from
the
crowd
i
explained
that
to
you
when
we
first
met
mr
magee
any
man
commented
max
ought
to
be
able
to
strangle
his
instincts
for
a
good
salary
payable
in
advance
you
come
here
said
the
hermit
with
annoyance
and
you
bring
with
you
the
sentiments
of
the
outside
world
the
world
i
have
foresworn
do
it
i
ask
you
i
do
get
you
reflected
max
no
pal
i
do
quite
grab
this
hermit
game
it
ai
human
nature
i
say
way
up
here
miles
from
the
little
brass
rail
and
the
sporting
extra
and
other
things
that
make
life
worth
living
it
beyond
me
i
not
asking
your
approval
replied
the
hermit
all
i
ask
is
to
be
let
alone
let
me
speak
said
miss
norton
peters
and
i
have
been
friends
you
might
say
for
three
years
it
was
three
years
ago
my
awed
eyes
first
fell
upon
him
selling
his
at
the
inn
he
was
to
me
then
the
true
romance
the
man
to
whom
the
world
means
nothing
without
a
certain
woman
at
his
side
that
is
what
he
has
meant
to
all
the
girls
who
came
to
baldpate
he
is
going
to
shatter
my
ideal
of
him
he
is
going
to
refuse
a
lady
in
distress
you
will
come
for
just
a
little
while
wo
you
mr
peters
but
peters
shook
his
head
again
i
dislike
women
as
a
sex
he
said
but
i
always
been
gentle
and
easy
with
isolated
examples
of
it
ai
my
style
to
turn
down
but
this
is
asking
too
much
i
sorry
but
i
got
to
be
true
to
my
oath
i
got
to
be
a
hermit
maybe
sneered
max
he
got
good
reason
for
being
a
hermit
maybe
there
brass
buttons
and
blue
uniforms
mixed
up
in
it
you
come
from
the
great
world
of
suspicion
answered
the
hermit
turning
reproving
eyes
upon
him
your
talk
is
natural
it
goes
with
the
life
you
lead
but
it
is
true
and
max
is
the
last
who
should
insinuate
rebuked
magee
why
only
last
night
he
denounced
suspicion
and
bemoaned
the
fact
that
there
is
so
much
of
it
in
the
world
well
he
might
replied
the
hermit
suspicion
is
the
of
modern
life
especially
in
new
york
he
drew
the
purple
closer
about
his
plump
form
i
remember
the
last
time
i
was
in
the
big
town
seeing
a
crowd
of
men
in
the
of
the
hoffman
house
one
of
them
long
lean
like
an
eel
stooped
down
and
whispered
in
the
ear
of
a
little
fellow
with
a
diamond
horseshoe
desecrating
his
haberdashery
and
pointing
to
another
man
near
by
i
wo
says
the
man
with
the
diamonds
do
introduce
nobody
to
nobody
let
every
man
play
his
own
game
i
say
that
new
york
that
the
essence
of
the
town
introduce
nobody
to
nobody
it
seems
odd
remarked
magee
to
hear
you
speak
of
the
time
you
walked
on
pavements
i
have
always
been
on
baldpate
mountain
replied
the
hermit
once
i
too
paid
taxes
and
wore
a
derby
hat
and
sat
in
barbers
chairs
yes
i
sat
in
in
many
towns
in
many
corners
of
this
little
round
globe
but
that
all
over
now
the
three
visitors
gazed
at
peters
with
a
new
interest
new
york
said
max
softly
as
a
better
man
might
have
spoken
the
name
of
the
girl
he
loved
its
a
great
little
christmas
tree
the
candles
are
always
burning
and
the
tinsel
presents
always
look
good
to
me
the
hermit
eyes
strayed
far
away
down
the
mountain
and
beyond
new
york
said
he
and
his
tone
was
that
in
which
max
had
said
the
words
a
great
little
christmas
tree
it
is
with
fine
presents
for
the
reaching
sometimes
at
night
here
i
see
it
as
it
was
four
years
ago
i
see
the
candles
lit
on
the
great
white
way
i
hear
the
elevated
roar
and
the
newsboys
shout
and
diamond
jim
brady
applauding
at
a
musical
comedy
first
night
new
york
max
rose
pompously
and
pointed
a
yellow
finger
at
the
hermit
of
baldpate
mountain
i
got
you
he
cried
in
triumph
i
wise
you
want
to
go
back
a
smile
crossed
the
visible
portion
of
the
hermit
face
i
guess
i
about
the
poorest
liar
in
the
world
he
said
i
never
got
away
with
but
one
lie
in
my
life
and
that
was
only
for
a
little
while
it
was
a
masterpiece
while
it
lasted
too
but
it
was
my
only
hit
as
a
liar
usually
i
fail
as
i
have
failed
now
i
lied
when
i
said
i
could
cook
for
you
because
i
had
to
be
true
to
my
hermit
oath
that
is
the
reason
i
afraid
afraid
echoed
magee
scared
said
peters
of
temptation
your
seventh
son
of
a
seventh
son
friend
here
has
read
my
palm
i
want
to
go
back
not
in
the
summer
when
the
inn
blazes
like
broadway
every
evening
and
i
can
sit
here
and
listen
to
the
latest
comic
opera
tunes
come
drifting
up
from
the
casino
and
go
down
and
mingle
with
the
muslin
brigade
any
time
i
want
and
see
the
sympathetic
look
in
their
eyes
as
they
buy
my
postals
it
ai
then
i
want
to
go
back
it
when
fall
comes
and
the
trees
on
the
mountain

bare
and
quimby
locks
up
the
inn
and
there
only
the
wind
and
me
on
the
mountain
then
i
get
the
fever

have
the
trade
to
think
of

think
of
ellen
and
new
york
she
my
wife
new
york
it
my
town
that
why
i
ca
come
among
you
to
cook

leading
me
into
temptation
greater
than
i
could
stand
i
hear
your
talk
and
like
as
not
when
you
went
away
i
shave
off
this
beard
and
burn
the
manuscript

and

down
into
the
marts
of
trade
last
night
i
walked
the
floor
till
two
i
ca
stand
such
temptation
peters
auditors
regarded
him
in
silence
he
rose
and
moved
toward
the
kitchen
door
now
you
understand
how
it
is
he
said
perhaps
you
will
go
and
leave
me
to
my
baking
one
minute
objected
magee
you
spoke
of
one
lie
your
masterpiece
we
must
hear
about
that
yes
spin
the
yarn
pal
requested
max
well
said
the
hermit
reluctantly
if
you
quite
comfortable
it
ai
very
short
please
beamed
miss
norton
with
a
sigh
the
hermit
of
baldpate
mountain
sank
upon
a
most
unsocial
seat
and
drew
his
purple
splendor
close
it
was
like
this
he
began
five
years
ago
i
worked
for
a
fruit
company
and
business
sent
me
sliding
along
the
edges
of
strange
seas
and
lands
i
met
little
brown
men
and
listened
to
the
soft
swish
of
the
banana
growing
and
had
an
orchestra
seat
at
a
revolution
or
two
do
look
for
a
magazine
story
about
overthrown
tyrants
or
anything
like
that
it
just
a
quiet
little
lie
i
speaking
of
told
on
a
quiet
little
afternoon
by
the
sands
of
a
sea
as
blue
as
baldpate
inn
must
have
been
this
morning
when
i
did
show
up
with
breakfast
sitting
on
those
yellow
sands
the
afternoon
i
speak
of
wearing
carpet
slippers
made
for
me
by
loving
so
to
speak
hands
i
saw
alexander
mcmann
come
along
he
was
tall
and
straight
and
young
and
free
and
i
envied
him
for
even
in
those
days
my
figure
would
never
have
done
in
a
clothing
advertisement
owing
to
the
heritage
of
too
many
table
about
the
middle
well
mcmann
sat
at
my
side
and
little
by
little
with
the
sea
washing
near
by
i
got
from
him
the
story
of
his
exile
and
why
i
do
need
to
tell
you
it
was
woman
had
sent
him
off
for
the
equator
this
one
name
was
marie
i
think
and
she
worked
at
a
in
kansas
city
from
the
young
man
description
of
her
i
gathered
that
she
had
cheeks
like
peaches
and
cream
but
a
heart
like
a
doughnut
which
is
hard
cast
you
off
i
asked
threw
me
down
said
he
well
it
seems
he
bought
a
ticket
for
that
country
where
i
met
him
and
come
down
there
to
forget
could
buy
the
ticket
he
said
soon
as
i
learned
how
to
pronounce
the
name
of
this
town
but
i
ca
forget
i
tried
it
hopeless
and
he
sat
there
looking
like
a
man
whose
best
friend
has
died
owing
him
money
i
wo
go
into
his
emotions
mr
bland
up
at
the
inn
is
suffering
them
at
the
present
moment
i
told
they
unimportant
i
hurry
on
to
the
lie
i
simply
say
he
was
sorrowful
and
it
seemed
to
me
a
crime
what
with
the
sun
so
bright
and
the
sea
so
blue
and
the
world
so
full
of
a
number
of
things
yes
it
certainly
was
a
crime
and
i
decided
he
had
to
be
cheered
up
at
any
cost
how
i
thought
a
while
gazing
up
at
the
sky
and
then
it
came
to
me
the
lie
the
great
glorious
lie
and
i
told
it
the
hermit
looked
in
defiance
round
the
listening
circle
chuck
full
of
sorrow
now
i
said
to
mcmann
it
wo
last
long
he
shook
his
head
i
told
him
at
me
do
you
see
me
doing
a
act
under
the
palms
do
you
find
anything
but
joy
in
my
face
and
he
could
the
lie
unfolding
itself
in
such
splendor
to
me
he
asked
i
said
years
ago
i
was
where
you
are
a
woman
had
spoken
to
me
as
mabel
or
marie
or
what
was
it
spoke
to
you
i
could
see
i
had
the
boy
interested
i
unfolded
my
story
as
it
occurred
to
me
at
the
moment
said
i
years
ago
i
saw
her
first
dancing
as
a
butterfly
dances
from
flower
to
flower
dancing
on
the
stage
a
fairy
sprite
i
loved
her
worshiped
her
it
could
never
be
there
in
the
dark
of
the
wings
she
told
me
so
and
she
shed
a
tear
a
sweet
tear
of
sorrow
at
parting
went
to
my
room
i
told
mcmann
a
lot
of
and
steamship
books
bright
red
books
the
color
came
off
on
my
eager
hands
i
picked
out
a
country
and
sailed
away
like
you
i
thought
i
could
never
be
happy
never
even
smile
again
look
at
me
he
looked
i
guess
my
face
radiated
bliss
the
idea
was
so
lovely
he
was
impressed
i
could
see
it
supremely
happy
i
told
him
am
my
own
master
i
wander
where
i
will
no
woman
tells
me
my
hour
for
going
out
or
my
hour
for
coming
in
i
wander
for
company
i
have
her
picture
as
i
saw
her
last
with
twinkling
feet
that
never
touched
earth
as
the
spirit
moves
i
go
you
can
move
the
memory
of
a
woman
in
a
flash
my
boy
but
it
takes
two
months
to
get
the
real
article
started
and
then
like
as
not
she
forgot
everything
of
importance
ever
thought
of
that
you
should
you
going
to
be
as
happy
as
i
am
study
me
reflect
i
waved
my
feet
toward
the
palms
i
had
certainly
made
an
impression
on
alexander
mcmann
as
we
walked
back
over
the
sands
and
streets
to
the
hotel
his
heart
got
away
from
that
cupid
and
he
was
almost
cheerful
i
was
gay
to
the
last
but
as
i
parted
from
him
my
own
heart
sank
i
knew
i
had
to
go
back
to
her
and
that
she
would
probably
give
me
a
scolding
about
the
carpet
slippers
i
parted
from
mcmann
with
a
last
word
of
cheer
then
i
went
to
the
ship
to
her
my
wife
that
was
the
lie
you
understand
she
traveled
everywhere
with
me
she
never
trusted
me
we
were
due
to
sail
that
night
and
i
was
glad
for
i
worried
some
over
what
i
had
done
suppose
my
wife
and
alexander
mcmann
should
meet
an
estimable
woman
but
large
determined
little
suggesting
the
butterfly
of
the
footlights
i
married
long
before
we
had
a
bad
session
over
the
carpet
slippers
the
boat
was
ready
to
sail
when
mcmann
came
aboard
he
carried
a
bag
and
his
face
shone
sent
for
me
he
said
wants
me
i
got
a
letter
from
my
brother
i
blow
into
kansas
like
a
cyclone
and
claim
her
i
was
paralyzed
at
that
minute
a
large
black
figure
appeared
on
deck
it
headed
for
me
it
says
sat
up
long
enough
go
below
now
mcmann
face
was
terrible
i
saw
it
was
all
up
lied
mcmann
i
explained
idea
just
came
to
me
it
fascinated
me
and
i
lied
she
did
turn
me
down
there
in
the
wings
and
she
shed
that
tear
i
spoke
of
too
but
when
i
was
looking
over
the
railroad
folders
she
sent
for
me
i
went
on
the
wings
of
love
it
was
two
blocks
but
i
went
on
the
wings
of
love
we
been
married
twenty
years
forgive
me
mcmann
mcmann
turned
around
he
picked
up
the
bag
i
asked
where
he
was
going
he
said
think
i
may
go
back
to
kansas
city
i
may
but
i
just
think
a
bit
first
and
he
climbed
into
the
ship
boat
i
never
saw
him
again
the
hermit
paused
and
gazed
dreamily
into
space
that
he
said
was
my
one
great
lie
my
masterpiece
a
year
afterward
i
came
up
here
on
the
mountain
to
be
a
hermit
as
a
result
of
it
asked
miss
norton
yes
answered
peters
i
told
the
story
to
a
friend
i
thought
he
was
a
friend
so
he
was
but
married
my
wife
got
to
hear
of
it
you
denied
my
existence
she
said
a
joke
i
told
her
joke
on
you
she
says
that
was
the
end
she
went
her
way
and
i
went
mine
just
unanimously
gone
her
way
so
long
i
was
a
little
dazed
at
first
with
my
freedom
after
fighting
for
a
living
alone
for
a
time
i
came
up
here
it
cheap
i
get
the
solitude
i
need
for
my
book
not
long
ago
i
heard
i
could
go
back
to
her
if
i
apologized
stick
to
your
guns
advised
max
i
trying
to
peters
replied
but
it
lonesome
here
in
winter
and
at
christmas
in
particular
this
was
a
christmas
present
from
ellen
she
picked
it
pretty
ai
it
you
see
why
i
come
down
and
cook
for
you
i
might
get
the
fever
for
society
and
shave
and
go
to
brooklyn
where
she
living
with
her
sister
but
said
magee
we
in
an
awful
fix
you
put
us
there
peters
as
a
man
of
honor
i
appeal
to
you
your
sense
of
fairness
must
tell
you
my
appeal
is
just
risk
it
one
more
day
and
i
have
a
cook
sent
up
from
the
village
just
one
day
there
no
danger
in
that
surely
you
can
resist
temptation
one
little
day
a
man
of
your
character
miss
norton
rose
and
stood
before
peters
she
fixed
him
with
her
eyes
eyes
into
which
no
man
could
gaze
and
go
his
way
unmoved
just
one
tiny
day
she
pleaded
peters
sighed
he
rose
i
a
fool
he
said
i
ca
help
it
i
take
chances
on
another
day
though
nobody
knows
where
it
lead
brooklyn
maybe
whispered
lou
max
to
magee
in
mock
horror
the
hermit
donned
his
coat
attended
to
a
few
household
duties
and
led
the
delegation
outside
dolefully
he
locked
the
door
of
his
shack
the
four
started
down
the
mountain
back
to
baldpate
with
our
cook
said
magee
into
the
girl
ear
i
know
now
how
cæsar
felt
when
he
rode
through
rome
with
his
festooned
about
his
chariot
wheels
max
again
chose
the
rear
triumphantly
escorting
peters
as
magee
and
the
girl
swung
into
the
lead
the
former
was
moved
to
recur
to
the
topic
he
had
handled
so
amateurishly
a
short
time
before
i
make
you
believe
in
me
yet
he
said
she
did
not
turn
her
head
the
moment
we
reach
the
inn
he
went
on
i
shall
come
to
you
with
the
package
of
money
in
my
hand
then
you
believe
i
want
to
help
you
tell
me
you
believe
then
very
likely
i
shall
answered
the
girl
without
interest
if
you
really
do
intend
to
give
me
that
money
no
one
must
know
about
it
no
one
shall
know
he
answered
but
you
and
me
they
walked
on
in
silence
then
shyly
the
girl
turned
her
head
oh
most
assuredly
she
was
desirable
clumsy
as
had
been
his
declaration
magee
resolved
to
stick
to
it
through
eternity
i
sorry
i
spoke
as
i
did
she
said
will
you
forgive
me
forgive
you
he
cried
why
i
and
now
she
interrupted
let
us
talk
of
other
things
of
ships
and
shoes
and
all
the
topics
in
the
world
he
replied
can
lead
to
but
one
with
me
ships
asked
the
girl
for
honeymoons
he
suggested
shoes
in
some
circles
of
society
i
believe
they
are
flung
at
bridal
parties
and
on
the
license
is
it
he
queried
i
not
try
you
on
cabbage
and
kings
laughed
the
girl
please
oh
please
do
fail
me
you
wo
will
you
her
face
was
serious
you
see
it
means
so
very
much
to
me
fail
you
cried
magee
i
hardly
do
that
now
in
ten
minutes
that
package
will
be
in
your
hands
along
with
my
fate
my
lady
i
shall
be
so
relieved
she
turned
her
face
away
there
was
a
faint
flush
in
the
cheek
toward
magee
and
happy
she
whispered
under
her
breath
they
were
then
at
the
great
front
door
of
baldpate
inn
chapter
xii
woe
in
number
seven
inside
before
the
office
fire
miss
thornhill
read
a
magazine
in
the
indolent
fashion
so
much
affected
at
baldpate
inn
during
the
heated
term
while
the
mayor
of
reuton
chatted
amiably
with
the
ponderously
coy
norton
into
this
circle
burst
the
envoys
to
the
hermitage
flushed
energetic
snowflaked
hail
to
the
chef
who
in
triumph
advances
cried
magee
he
pointed
to
the
door
through
which
max
was
leading
the
captured
peters
you
got
him
didyu
rasped
norton
without
the
use
of
anesthetics
answered
magee
everybody
ready
for
one
of
peters
inimitable
lunches
put
me
down
at
the
head
of
the
list
contributed
the
mayor
myra
thornhill
laid
down
her
magazine
and
fixed
her
great
black
eyes
upon
the
radiant
girl
in
corduroy
and
was
the
walk
in
the
morning
air
she
asked
all
you
expected
all
and
much
more
laughed
miss
norton
mischievously
regarding
the
man
who
had
babbled
to
her
of
love
on
the
mountain
by
the
way
enjoy
peters
while
you
can
he
back
for
just
one
day
eat
drink
and
be
merry
for
the
cook
leaves
as
the
fellow
says
supplemented
max
removing
his
overcoat
how
about
a
quick
lunch
peters
inquired
magee
out
of
what
i
like
to
know
put
in
norton
not
a
thing
in
the
house
to
eat
just
like
a
man
you
did
look
in
the
right
place
replied
peters
with
relish
i
got
supplies
for
a
couple
of
days
in
the
kitchen
well
what
the
sense
in
hiding
the
large
lady
inquired
it
ai
hiding
it
system
explained
peters
something
women
do
understand
he
came
close
to
magee
and
whispered
low
you
did
warn
me
there
was
another
of
the
last
on
my
word
of
honor
magee
told
him
the
last
sneered
peters
there
is
any
last
up
here
and
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
new
eve
in
his
mountain
eden
he
turned
away
to
the
kitchen
now
whispered
magee
to
miss
norton
i
get
you
that
package
prove
that
it
was
for
you
i
fought
and
bled
the
mayor
of
reuton
watch
for
our
chance
when
i
see
you
again
i
have
it
in
my
pocket

must
fail
me
she
replied
it
means
so
much
magee
started
for
the
stairs
between
him
and
them
loomed
suddenly
the
great
bulk
of
cargan
his
hard
menacing
eyes
looked
full
into
magee
i
want
to
speak
to
you
young
fellow
he
remarked
i
flattered

magee
that
you

my
company

enchanting
in
ten
minutes
i
be
ready
for
another
interview

now
answered
the
mayor
even
if
you
do
know
it
his
tone
was
that
of
one
correcting
a
child
he
took
magee
arm
in
a
grip
which
recalled
to
that
gentleman
a
fact
the
muckraking
stories
always
dwelt
on
how
this
cargan
had
in
the
old
days
put
away
his
man
in
many
shady
corners
of
a
great
city
come
over
here
said
cargan
he
led
the
way
to
a
window
over
his
shoulder

noted
the
troubled
eyes
of
miss
norton
following

seeing
stories
on
the
corruption
of
the
courts
is
so
plentiful
you
let
the
shame
of
the
city
halls
alone
for
a
while
but
well
i
guess
i
what
you
guys
call
good
copy
big
brutal
uneducated
picturesque
you
see
i
read
them
stories
myself
how
long
will
the
american
public
stand
being
ruled
by
a
man
like
this
when
it
might
be
authorizing
pretty
boys
with
kid
gloves
to
get
next
to
the
good
things
that
the
dope
ai
it
the
old
dope
of
the
reform
gang
the
ballyhoo
of
the
bunch
that
ca
let
the
existing
order
stand
do
worry
i
ai
going
to
get
started
on
that
again
but
i
want
to
talk
to
you
serious
like
a
father
there
was
a
young
fellow
like
you
once
like
me
exactly
he
was
out
working
on
long
hours
and
short
pay
for
the
reform
gang
and
he
happened
to
get
hold
of
something
that
a
man
i
knew
a
man
high
up
in
public
office
wanted
and
wanted
bad
the
young
fellow
was
going
to
get
two
hundred
dollars
for
the
article
he
was
writing
my
friend
offered
him
twenty
thousand
to
call
it
off
what
the
young
fellow
do
wrote
the
article
of
course
said
magee
now
now
reproved
cargan
that
remark
do
fit
in
with
the
estimate
i
made
of
you
i
think
you
a
smart
boy
do
disappoint
me
this
young
fellow
i
speak
of
he
was
smart
all
right
he
thought
the
matter
over
he
knew
the
reform
bunch
through
and
through
all
glory
and
no
pay
serving
them
he
knew
how
they
chased
bubbles
and
made
a
lot
of
noise
and
never
got
anywhere
in
the
end
he
thought
it
over
magee
the
same
as
you
going
to
do
on
says
this
lad
and
added
five
figures
to
his
roll
as
easy
as
we
add
a
nickel
he
had
brains
that
guy
and
no
conscience
commented
magee
conscience
said
cargan
ai
worth
much
except
as
an
excuse
for
a
man
that
has
made
good
to
give
his
wife
how
much
did
you
say
you
was
going
to
get
for
this
article
magee
looked
him
coolly
in
the
eye
if
it
ever
written
he
said
it
will
be
a
story
there
ai
anything
like
that
in
it
for
you
replied
the
mayor
think
over
what
i
told
you
i
afraid
smiled
magee
i
too
busy
to
think
he
again
crossed
the
office
floor
to
the
stairway
before
the
fire
sat
the
girl
of
the
station
her
big
eyes
upon
him
pleadingly
with
a
reassuring
smile
in
her
direction
he
darted
up
the
stairs
and
now
he
thought
as
he
closed
and
locked
the
door
of
number
seven
behind
him
for
the
swag
so
cargan
would
give
twenty
thousand
for
that
little
package
i
do
blame
him
he
opened
a
window
and
glanced
out
along
the
balcony
it
was
deserted
in
either
direction
its
snowy
floor
was
innocent
of
footprints
number
seven
he
knelt
by
the
fireplace
and
dug
up
the
brick
under
which
lay
the
package
so
dear
to
many
hearts
on
baldpate
mountain
i
might
have
known
he
muttered
for
the
money
was
gone
he
dug
up
several
of
the
bricks
and
rummaged
about
beneath
them
no
use
the
fat
little
bundle
of
bills
had
flown
only
an
ugly
hole
gaped
up
at
him
he
sat
down
of
course
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
suppose
that
such
treasure
as
this
would
stay
long
in
a
so
obvious
he
who
had
made
a
luxurious
living
writing
tales
of
the
chase
of
gems
and
plate
and
gold
had
bungled
the
thing
from
the
first
he
could
hammer
out
on
a
typewriter
wild
plots
and
with
a
cupid
busy
all
over
the
place
but
he
could
not
live
them
a
cupid
good
lord
he
remembered
the
eyes
of
the
girl
in
blue
corduroy
as
they
had
met
his
when
he
turned
to
the
stairs
what
would
she
say
now
on
this
he
had
gaily
staked
her
faith
in
him
this
was
to
be
the
test
of
his
sincerity
the
proof
of
his
devotion
and
now
he
must
go
to
her
looking
like
a
fool
once
more
go
to
her
and
confess
that
again
he
had
failed
her
his
rage
blazed
forth
so
they
had
got
to
him
after
all
who
he
thought
of
the
smooth
crafty
mountain
of
a
man
who
had
detained
him
a
moment
ago
who
but
cargan
and
max
of
course
they
had
found
his
childish
and
the
money
had
come
home
to
their
eager
hands
no
doubt
they
were
laughing
slyly
at
him
now
well
he
would
show
them
yet
he
got
up
and
walked
the
floor
once
he
had
held
them
up
in
the
snow
and
spoiled
their
little
game
he
would
do
it
again
how
when
he
did
not
know
his
soul
cried
for
action
of
some
sort
but
he
was
up
against
a
blind
alley
and
he
knew
it
he
unlocked
the
door
of
number
seven
to
go
to
meet
the
sweet
eagerness
of
the
girl
who
depended
on
him
to
confess
himself
tricked
it
took
all
the
courage
he
had
why
had
it
all
happened
anyhow
confound
it
had
he
come
up
here
to
be
alone
with
his
thoughts
but
brighter
side
it
had
given
him
her
or
it
would
give
him
her
before
the
last
card
was
played
he
shut
his
teeth
tightly
and
went
down
the
stairs
mr
bland
had
added
himself
to
the
group
about
the
fire
quickly
the
eyes
of
miss
norton
met
magee
she
was
trembling
with
excitement
cargan
huge
red
cheery
got
in
magee
path
once
more
i
annihilate
this
man
thought
magee
i
been
figuring
said
the
mayor
that
was
one
thing
he
did
have
to
contend
with
no
sir
there
was
any
bright
young
men
hunting
up
old
napoleon
and
knocking
him
in
the
monthly
magazines
they
did
go
down
to
sardinia
and
pump
it
out
of
the
neighbors
that
he
started
business
on
borrowed
money
and
that
his
father
drank
more
than
was
good
for
him
they
did
run
illustrated
articles
about
the
diamonds
he
wore
and
moving
pictures
of
him
eating
soup
no
i
guess
not
replied
magee
abstractedly
i
reckon
there
was
a
lot
in
record
was
meant
for
the
newspapers
continued
cargan
reflectively
and
it
did
get
there
nap
was
lucky
he
had
it
on
the
reformers
there
they
could
squash
him
with
the
power
of
the
press
magee
broke
away
from
the
mayor
rehashed
history
and
hurried
to
miss
norton
you
promised
yesterday
he
reminded
her
to
show
me
the
pictures
of
the
admiral
so
i
did
she
replied
rising
quickly
to
think
you
have
spent
all
this
time
in
baldpate
inn
and
not
paid
homage
to
its
own
particular
cock
of
the
walk
she
led
him
to
a
portrait
hanging
beside
the
desk
behold
she
said
the
admiral
on
a
sunny
day
in
july
note
the
starchy
grandeur
of
him
even
with
the
thermometer
up
in
the
clouds
that
one
of
the
things
the
fleet
adores
in
him
can
you
imagine
the
flurry
at
the
approach
of
all
that
superiority
theodore
roosevelt
william
faversham
and
richard
harding
davis
all
arriving
together
could
overshadow
the
admiral
for
a
minute
magee
gazed
at
the
picture
of
a
pompous
little
man
whose
fierce
mustache
seemed
anxious
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
hair
on
his
head
a
bald
hero
at
a
summer
resort
he
commented
it
seems
incredible
oh
they
think
he
lost
his
hair
fighting
for
the
flag
she
laughed
it
winter
and
snowing
or
i
should
dare
and
over
here
is
the
admiral
on
the
veranda
playing
it
a
quarter
deck
and
here
the
great
portrait
andrew
rutter
with
a
profaning
arm
over
the
admiral
shoulder
the
old
ladies
make
their
complaints
to
rutter
in
softer
tones
after
seeing
that
picture
and
this
asked
magee
moving
farther
from
the
group
by
the
fire
a
precious
one
i
wonder
they
leave
it
here
in
winter
this
is
the
admiral
as
a
young
man
clipped
from
a
magazine
article
even
without
the
mustache
you
see
he
had
a
certain
martial
bearing
and
now
he
the
ruler
of
the
queen
navee
smiled
magee
he
looked
about
is
it
possible
to
see
the
room
where
the
admiral
plays
his
famous
game
step
softly
she
answered
in
here
there
stands
the
very
table
they
went
into
the
small
at
the
right
of
the
entrance
to
the
office
and
magee
quietly
closed
the
door
behind
them
the
time
had
come
he
felt
his
heart
sink
well
said
the
girl
with
an
eagerness
she
could
not
conceal
magee
groped
for
words
and
found
his
old
friends
of
the
mountain
i
love
you
he
cried
desperately
you
must
believe
i
want
to
help
you
it
looks
rather
the
other
way
now
i
admit
i
want
you
to
have
that
money
i
do
know
who
you
are
nor
what
this
all
means
but
i
want
you
to
have
it
i
went
determined
to
give
it
to
you
really
the
word
was
at
least
fifty
degrees
below
the
temperature
of
the
yes
really
i
wo
ask
you
to
believe
but
i
telling
the
truth
i
went
to
the
place
where
i
had
fatuously
hid
the
money
under
a
brick
of
my
fireplace
it
was
gone
how
terribly
unfortunate
yes
is
it
magee
rejoiced
that
she
took
so
calm
a
view
of
it
they
searched
the
room
of
course
and
they
found
the
money
they
on
top
now
but
i
going
he
stopped
for
he
had
seen
her
face
she
taking
a
calm
view
of
it
no
indeed
billy
magee
saw
that
she
was
furiously
wildly
angry
he
remembered
always
having
written
it
down
that
beautiful
women
were
even
more
beautiful
in
anger
how
he
wondered
had
he
fallen
into
that
error
please
do
not
bore
me
she
said
through
her
teeth
with
any
further
recital
of
what
you
going
to
do
you
seem
to
have
a
fatal
facility
in
that
line
your
record
of
accomplishment
is
pathetically
weak
and
oh
what
a
fool
i
been
i
believed
even
after
last
night
i
believed
no
she
was
not
going
to
cry
hers
was
no
mood
for
tears
what
said
the
librettist
there
is
beauty
in
the
roaring
of
the
gale
and
the
tiger
when
of
his
tail
such
was
the
beauty
of
a
woman
in
anger
and
nothing
to
get
enthusiastic
about
thought
magee
i
know
he
said
helplessly
you
terribly
disappointed
and
i
blame
you
but
you
will
find
out
that
you
done
me
an
injustice
going
one
thing
said
she
smiling
a
smile
that
could
have
cut
glass
you
are
going
to
do
i
know
that
you
wo
fail
this
time
because
i
shall
personally
see
you
through
with
it
you
going
to
stop
making
a
fool
of
me
tell
me
pleaded
billy
magee
tell
me
who
you
are
what
this
is
all
about
ca
you
see
i
working
in
the
dark
you
must
she
threw
open
the
door
an
english
officer
she
remarked
loudly
stepping
out
into
the
other
room
taught
the
admiral
the
game
at
least
so
he
said
it
added
so
much
romance
to
it
in
the
eyes
of
the
fleet
ca
you
see
india
the
hot
sun
the
kipling
local
color
a
silent
tanned
handsome
man
eternally
playing
solitaire
on
the
porch
of
the
barracks
has
the
barracks
a
porch
roused
humiliated
baffled
magee
felt
his
cheeks
burn
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
he
muttered
why
coin
the
inevitable
into
a
bromide
she
asked
magee
joined
the
group
by
the
fire
never
before
in
his
life
had
he
been
so
determined
on
anything
as
he
was
now
that
the
package
of
money
should
return
to
his
keeping
but
how
how
trace
through
this
maze
of
humans
the
present
holder
of
that
precious
bundle
of
collateral
he
looked
at
max
sneering
his
sneer
at
the
mayor
side
at
the
mayor
himself
nonchalant
as
the
admiral
being
photographed
at
bland
author
of
the
arabella
fiction
sprawling
at
ease
before
the
fire
at
the
tawdry
norton
and
at
myra
thornhill
who
had
by
her
pleading
the
night
before
made
him
ridiculous
who
of
these
had
the
money
now
who
but
cargan
and
max
their
faces
serene
their
eyes
eagerly
on
the
preparations
for
lunch
their
plans
for
leaving
baldpate
inn
no
doubt
already
made
and
then
magee
saw
coming
down
the
stairs
another
figure
one
he
had
forgot
professor
thaddeus
bolton
he
of
the
mysterious
dialogue
by
the
annex
door
on
the
professor
forehead
was
a
surprising
red
scratch
and
his
eyes
no
longer
hidden
by
the
double
convex
lenses
stood
revealed
a
gray
in
the
light
of
noon
a
most
unfortunate
accident
explained
the
old
man
most
distressing
i
have
broken
my
glasses
i
am
almost
blind
without
them
how
it
happen
doc
asked
cargan
easily
i
came
into
unexpected
juxtaposition
with
an
open
door
returned
professor
bolton
stupid
of
me
but
i
always
doing
it
really
the
agility
displayed
by
doors
in
getting
in
my
path
is
surprising
you
and
max
can
sympathize
with
each
other
said
magee
i
thought
for
a
moment
your
injuries
might
have
been
received
in
the
same
cause
do
worry
doc
mr
bland
soothed
him
we
all
keep
a
weather
eye
out
for
reporters
that
want
to
connect
you
up
with
the
peroxide
blondes
the
professor
turned
his
ineffectual
gaze
on
the
haberdasher
and
there
was
a
startlingly
ironic
smile
on
his
face
i
know
mr
bland
he
said
that
my
safety
is
your
dearest
wish
the
hermit
of
baldpate
announced
that
lunch
was
ready
and
with
the
others
magee
took
his
place
at
the
table
food
for
thought
was
also
his
the
spectacles
of
professor
thaddeus
bolton
were
broken
somewhere
in
the
scheme
of
things
those
smashed
lenses
must
fit
but
where
chapter
xiii
the
exquisite
hayden
it
was
past
three
the
early
twilight
crept
up
the
mountain
and
the
shadows
began
to
lengthen
in
the
great
bare
office
of
baldpate
inn
in
the
red
flicker
of
firelight
magee
sat
and
pondered
the
interval
since
luncheon
had
passed
lazily
he
was
no
nearer
to
guessing
which
of
baldpate
inn
winter
guests
hugged
close
the
precious
package
exasperated
angry
he
waited
for
he
knew
not
what
restless
all
the
while
to
act
but
having
not
the
glimmer
of
an
inspiration
as
to
what
his
course
ought
to
be
he
heard
the
rustle
of
skirts
on
the
stair
landing
and
looked
up
down
the
broad
stairway
so
well
designed
to
serve
as
a
for
the
sartorial
triumphs
of
baldpate
gay
summer
people
came
the
tall
handsome
girl
who
had
the
night
before
set
all
his
plans
awry
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
inn
she
had
hitherto
been
to
magee
but
a
puppet
of
the
shadows
a
figure
more
fictitious
than
real
now
for
the
first
time
he
looked
upon
her
as
a
girl
noted
the
red
in
her
olive
cheeks
the
fire
in
her
dark
eyes
and
realized
that
her
interest
in
that
package
of
money
might
be
something
more
than
another
queer
quirk
in
the
tangle
of
events
she
smiled
a
friendly
smile
at
magee
and
took
the
chair
he
offered
one
small
slipper
beat
a
discreet
tattoo
on
the
polished
floor
of
office
again
she
suggested
to
billy
magee
a
house
of
wealth
and
warmth
and
luxury
a
house
where
arnold
bennett
and
the
are
often
discussed
a
house
the
head
of
which
becomes
purple
and
apoplectic
at
the
mention
of
colonel
roosevelt
name
last
night
magee
she
said
i
told
you
frankly
why
i
had
come
to
baldpate
inn
you
were
good
enough
to
say
that
you
would
help
me
if
you
could
the
time
has
come
when
you
can
i
think
yes
answered
magee
his
heart
sank
what
now
i
must
confess
that
i
spied
this
morning
she
went
on
it
was
rude
of
me
perhaps
but
i
think
almost
anything
is
excusable
under
the
circumstances
do
you
i
witnessed
a
scene
in
the
hall
above
magee
i
know
who
has
the
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
you
know
cried
magee
his
heart
gave
a
great
bound
at
last
and
then
he
stopped
i
afraid
i
must
ask
you
not
to
tell
me
he
added
sadly
the
girl
looked
at
him
in
wonder
she
was
of
a
type
common
in
world
delicate
sensitive
true
in
her
pride
and
haughtiness
she
suggested
the
heights
of
the
eternal
hills
but
at
sight
of
those
feminine
heights
billy
magee
had
always
been
one
to
seize
his
alpenstock
in
a
more
determined
grip
and
climb
witness
his
attentions
to
the
supurb
helen
faulkner
he
had
a
moment
of
faltering
here
was
a
girl
who
at
least
did
not
doubt
him
who
ascribed
to
him
the
virtues
of
a
gentleman
who
was
glad
to
trust
in
him
should
he
transfer
his
allegiance
no
he
could
hardly
do
that
now
you
ask
me
not
to
tell
you
repeated
the
girl
slowly
that
demands
an
explanation
replied
billy
magee
i
want
you
to
understand
to
be
certain
that
i
would
delight
to
help
you
if
i
could
but
the
fact
is
that
before
you
came
i
gave
my
word
to
secure
the
package
you
speak
of
for
another
woman
i
can
not
break
my
promise
to
her
i
see
she
answered
her
tone
was
cool
i
very
sorry
magee
went
on
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
seem
to
be
of
very
little
service
to
any
one
just
now
i
would
give
a
great
deal
to
have
the
information
you
were
about
to
give
me
but
since
i
could
not
use
it
helping
you
you
will
readily
see
that
i
must
not
listen
sorry
i
sorry
too
replied
the
girl
thank
you
very
much
for
telling
me
now
i
must
go
forward
alone
she
smiled
unhappily
i
afraid
you
must
answered
billy
magee
on
the
stairs
appeared
the
slim
figure
of
the
other
girl
her
great
eyes
were
wistful
her
face
was
pale
she
came
toward
them
through
the
red
firelight
magee
saw
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
waver
in
his
allegiance
even
for
a
moment
for
he
loved
her
wanted
her
surely
the
heights
are
inspiring
but
far
more
companionable
is
the
brook
that
sparkles
in
the
valley
it
rather
dull
is
it
asked
miss
norton
of
the
thornhill
girl
by
the
side
of
the
taller
woman
she
seemed
slight
almost
childish
have
you
seen
the
pictures
of
the
admiral
miss
thornhill
looking
at
them
is
our
one
diversion
i
do
not
care
to
see
them
thank
you
myra
thornhill
replied
moving
toward
the
stairs
he
is
a
very
dear
friend
of
my
father
she
passed
up
and
out
of
sight
miss
norton
turned
away
from
the
fire
and
magee
rose
hastily
to
follow
he
stood
close
behind
her
gazing
down
at
her
golden
hair
shimmering
in
the
dark
i
just
been
thinking
he
said
lightly
what
an
absolutely
ridiculous
figure
i
must
be
in
your
eyes
buzzing
round
and
round
like
a
bee
in
a
bottle
and
getting
nowhere
at
all
listen
no
one
has
left
the
inn
while
they
stay
there
hope
am
i
not
to
have
one
more
chance
a
chance
to
prove
to
you
how
much
i
care
she
turned
and
even
in
the
dusk
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
wet
oh
i
do
know
i
do
know
she
whispered
i
not
angry
any
more
i
just
at
sea
i
do
know
what
to
think
what
to
do
why
try
any
longer
i
think
i
go
away
and
give
up
you
must
do
that
urged
magee
they
came
back
into
the
firelight
miss
thornhill
has
just
informed
me
that
she
knows
who
has
the
package
indeed
said
the
girl
calmly
but
her
face
had
flushed
i
did
let
her
tell
me
of
course
why
not
oh
how
maddening
women
could
be
why
not
magee
tone
was
hurt
because
i
could
use
her
information
in
getting
the
money
for
you
you
are
still
to
get
the
money
for
me
maddening
certainly
as
a
collar
of
magee
began
but
caught
himself
no
he
would
prate
no
more
of
to
i
not
ask
you
to
believe
it
he
said
until
i
bring
it
to
you
and
place
it
in
your
hand
she
turned
her
face
slowly
to
his
and
lifted
her
blue
eyes
i
wonder
she
said
i
wonder
the
firelight
fell
on
her
lips
her
hair
her
eyes
and
magee
knew
that
his
selfish
bachelorhood
was
at
an
end
hitherto
marriage
had
been
to
him
the
picture
drawn
by
the
pathetic
exiled
master
there
are
no
more
pleasant
down
which
you
may
wander
but
the
road
lies
long
and
straight
and
dusty
to
the
grave
what
if
it
were
so
with
the
hand
of
a
girl
like
this
in
his
what
if
the
pleasant
of
his
solitude
did
bear
hereafter
the
no
thoroughfare
sign
long
the
road
might
be
and
he
would
rejoice
in
its
length
dusty
perhaps
but
her
smile
through
the
dust
would
make
it
all
worth
while
he
stooped
to
her
give
me
please
he
said
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
it
was
a
poor
speech
compared
to
what
was
in
his
heart
but
billy
magee
was
rapidly
learning
that
most
of
the
pretty
speeches
went
with
puppets
who
could
not
feel
bland
and
max
came
in
from
a
brisk
walk
on
the
veranda
the
mayor
of
reuton
who
had
been
dozing
near
the
desk
stirred
great
air
up
here
remarked
max
rubbing
his
hands
before
the
fire
ought
to
be
pumped
down
into
the
region
of
the
white
lights
it
sure
would
stir
things
up
it
would
put
out
the
lights
at
ten
answered
magee
and
inculcate
other
wholesome
habits
of
living
disastrous
to
the
restaurant
impresarios
miss
norton
rose
and
ascended
the
stairs
still
the
protesting
magee
was
at
her
heels
at
the
head
of
the
stair
she
turned
you
shall
have
your
final
chance
she
said
the
mayor
max
and
bland
are
alone
in
the
office
i
do
approve
of
eavesdropping
at
baldpate
in
the
summer
it
has
spoiled
a
lot
of
perfectly
adorable
engagements
but
in
winter
it
different
whether
you
really
want
to
help
me
or
not
sure
i
do
know
but
if
you
do
the
conversation
below
now
might
prove
of
interest
i
sure
it
would
magee
replied
well
i
have
a
scheme
listen
baldpate
inn
is
located
in
a
temperance
county
that
does
mean
that
people
do
drink
here
it
simply
means
that
there
a
lot
of
mystery
and
romance
connected
with
the
drinking
sometimes
those
who
follow
the
god
of
chance
in
the
late
at
night
grow
thirsty
now
it
happens
that
there
is
a
in
the
floor
of
the
up
which
drinks
are
frequently
passed
from
the
cellar
is
that
exciting
a
hotel
clerk
who
became
human
once
in
my
presence
told
me
all
about
it
if
you
went
into
the
cellar
and
hunted
about
you
might
find
that
door
and
climb
up
into
the
a
bully
idea
agreed
magee
i
hurry
down
there
this
minute
i
more
grateful
than
you
can
guess
for
this
chance
and
this
time
but
you
see
he
found
the
back
stairs
and
descended
in
the
kitchen
the
hermit
got
in
his
path
magee
he
pleaded
i
consider
that
in
a
way
i
work
for
you
here
i
got
something
important
to
tell
you
just
a
minute
sorry
answered
magee
but
i
ca
possibly
stop
now
in
an
hour
talk
to
you
show
me
the
cellar
door
and
do
mention
where
i
gone
there
a
good
fellow
peters
protested
that
his
need
of
talk
was
urgent
but
to
no
avail
magee
hurried
to
the
cellar
and
with
the
aid
of
a
box
of
matches
found
a
ladder
leading
to
a
door
cut
in
the
floor
above
he
climbed
through
dust
and
cobwebs
unfastened
the
catch
and
pushed
cautiously
upward
in
another
minute
he
was
standing
in
the
chill
little
softly
he
opened
the
door
about
half
an
inch
and
put
his
ear
to
it
the
three
men
were
grouped
very
close
at
hand
and
he
heard
mr
bland
speaking
in
low
tones
i
talking
to
you
boys
as
a
friend
the
show
is
over
there
ai
no
use
hanging
round
for
the
concert
there
wo
be
none
go
home
and
get
some
clean
collars
and
a
square
meal
if
you
think
i
going
to
be
shook
off
by
any
fairy
story
like
that
said
the
mayor
of
reuton
you
a
child
with
all
a
child
touching
faith
all
right
replied
mr
bland
i
thought
i
pass
you
the
tip
all
it
ai
nothing
to
me
what
you
do
but
it
all
over
and
lost
out
i
sorry
you
have
but
i
take
hayden
orders
damn
hayden
snarled
the
mayor
it
was
his
idea
to
make
a
play
out
of
this
thing
he
responsible
for
this
silly
trip
to
baldpate
this
audience
we
been
acting
for
he
let
us
in
for
them
i
know
said
bland
but
you
ca
deny
that
baldpate
inn
looked
like
the
ideal
spot
at
first
secluded
off
the
beaten
path
you
know
and
all
that
yes
sneered
the
mayor
as
secluded
as
a
the
sunday
before
christmas
well
who
could
have
guessed
it
went
on
mr
bland
as
i
say
i
care
what
you
do
i
just
passed
you
the
tip
i
got
that
nice
little
package
of
the
long
green
i
got
it
where
you
never
find
it
yes
sir
it
returned
to
the
loving
hands
of
little
joe
bland
that
brought
it
here
first
it
ai
going
to
roam
no
more
so
what
the
use
of
your
sticking
around
how
did
you
get
hold
of
it
inquired
lou
max
i
had
my
eye
on
this
little
professor
person
explained
mr
bland
this
morning
when
magee
went
up
the
mountain
i
trailed
the
to
magee
room
when
i
busted
in
unannounced
by
the
butler
he
was
making
his
getaway
i
do
like
to
talk
about
what
followed
he
an
old
man
and
i
sure
did
mean
to
break
his
glasses
nor
scratch
his
dome
of
thought
there
ideas
in
that
dome
go
back
to
the
time
of
anthony
chaucer
but
he
always
talking
about
that
literature
chair
of
his
why
could
he
stay
at
home
and
sit
in
it
anyhow
i
got
the
bundle
all
right
all
right
i
wonder
what
the
little
fossil
wants
with
it
the
doc
glasses
broke
said
max
evidently
to
the
mayor
of
reuton
came
cargan
voice
bland
how
much
do
you
make
working
for
this
nice
kind
gentleman
mr
hayden
oh
about
two
thousand
a
year
with
pickings
replied
bland
yes
went
on
cargan
i
ai
no
charles
dana
gibson
with
words
my
talk
a
little
rough
and
sketchy
i
guess
but
here
the
outline
plain
as
i
can
make
it
two
thousand
a
year
from
hayden
twenty
thousand
in
two
seconds
if
you
hand
that
package
to
me
no
objected
bland
i
been
honest
after
a
fashion
i
ca
quite
stand
for
that
i
working
for
hayden
do
be
a
fool
sneered
max
of
course
said
the
mayor
i
appreciate
your
scruples
having
had
a
few
in
my
day
myself
though
you
never
think
so
to
read
the
but
look
at
it
sensible
the
money
belongs
to
me
if
you
was
to
hand
it
over
you
be
just
doing
plain
justice
what
right
has
hayden
on
his
side
i
did
what
was
agreed
do
i
get
my
pay
no
who
are
you
to
defeat
the
ends
of
justice
this
way
that
how
you
ought
to
look
at
it
you
give
me
what
my
due
and
you
put
twenty
thousand
in
your
pocket
by
an
honest
act
hayden
comes
he
asks
for
the
bundle
you
point
to
the
dynamited
safe
you
did
your
best
no
said
bland
but
his
tone
was
less
firm
i
ca
go
back
on
hayden
no
it
would
twenty
thousand
repeated
cargan
ten
years
salary
the
way
going
ahead
at
present
a
lot
of
money
for
a
young
man
if
i
was
you
i
would
hesitate
a
minute
think
what
hayden
ever
done
for
you
he
throw
you
down
some
day
the
way
he
thrown
me
i
i
do
know
wavered
bland
magee
in
the
knew
that
hayden
emissary
was
tottering
on
the
brink
you
could
set
up
in
business
whined
max
why
if
i
had
that
much
money
at
your
age
i
be
a
millionaire
you
get
the
package
suggested
the
mayor
take
twenty
thousand
out
and
slip
the
rest
to
me
no
questions
asked
i
guess
there
ai
nobody
mixed
up
in
this
affair
will
go
up
on
the
housetops
and
shout
about
it
when
we
get
back
to
reuton
well
began
bland
he
was
lost
suddenly
the
quiet
of
baldpate
mountain
was
assailed
by
a
loud
pounding
at
the
inn
door
and
a
voice
crying
bland
let
me
in
there
hayden
now
cried
mr
bland
it
ai
too
late
came
the
mayor
voice
you
can
do
it
yet
it
ai
too
late
do
what
cried
bland
in
a
firm
tone
you
ca
bribe
me
cargan
he
raised
his
voice
go
round
to
the
east
door
mr
hayden
then
he
added
to
cargan
that
my
answer
i
going
to
let
him
in
let
him
in
bellowed
the
mayor
let
the
hound
in
i
guess
i
got
something
to
say
to
mr
hayden
there
came
to
magee
ears
the
sound
of
opening
doors
and
of
returning
footsteps
how
do
you
do
cargan
said
a
voice
new
to
baldpate
cut
the
society
howdydoes
replied
the
mayor
hotly
there
a
little
score
to
be
settled
between
me
and
you
hayden
i
ai
quite
wise
to
your
ways
i
do
quite
follow

me
when

any
new
deal

was
to

two
hundred
thousand

i
get

because
replied
hayden
smoothly

er
little
favor

were
to
grant
me
in
return
is
to
be
made
useless
by
the
courts

bland
begged
wait
to
get
my
own
money
i
guess
not
show
me
where
it
is
remember
put
in
cargan
that
money
mine
and
do
have
any
pipe
dreams
about
the
law
the
law
ai
called
into
things
of
this
sort
as
a
rule
i
guess
you
be
the
last
to
call
it
you
never
get
away
from
here
with
my
money
magee
opened
the
door
farther
and
saw
the
figure
of
the
stranger
hayden
confronting
the
mayor
cargan
title
of
exquisite
best
described
him
the
newcomer
was
tall
fair
fastidious
in
dress
and
manner
a
revolver
gleamed
in
his
hand
joe
he
said
firmly
take
me
to
that
money
at
once
it
out
here
replied
bland
he
and
hayden
disappeared
through
the
door
into
the
darkness
cargan
and
max
followed
close
behind
hot
with
excitement
magee
slipped
from
his
place
of
concealment
a
battle
fit
for
the
gods
was
in
the
air
he
must
be
in
the
midst
of
it
perhaps
again
in
a
fight
it
would
be
the
third
party
that
would
emerge
victorious
in
the
darkness
of
the
he
bumped
into
a
limp
clinging
figure
it
proved
to
be
the
hermit
of
baldpate
mountain
i
got
to
talk
to
you
magee
he
whispered
in
a
frightened
tremolo
i
got
to
have
a
word
with
you
this
minute
not
now
cried
magee
pushing
him
aside
later
the
hermit
wildly
seized
his
arm
no
now
he
said
there
strange
here
magee
i
got
something
to
tell
you
about
a
package
of
money
i
found
in
the
kitchen
magee
stood
very
still
beside
him
in
the
darkness
he
heard
the
hermit
excited
breathing
chapter
xiv
the
sign
of
the
open
window
undecided
magee
looked
toward
the
kitchen
door
from
behind
which
came
the
sound
of
men
voices
then
he
smiled
turned
and
led
peters
back
into
the
office
the
hermit
of
baldpate
fairly
trembled
with
news
since
i
broke
in
on
you
yesterday
morning
he
said
in
a
low
tone
as
he
took
a
seat
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
one
thing
has
followed
another
so
fast
that
i
a
little
dazed
i
ca
just
get
the
full
meaning
of
it
all
you
have
nothing
on
me
there
peters
magee
answered
i
either
well
went
on
the
hermit
as
i
say
through
all
this
downpour
of
people
including
women
i
hung
on
to
one
idea
i
working
for
you
you
give
me
my
wages
you
the
boss
that
why
i
feel
i
ought
to
give
what
information
i
got
to
you
yes
yes
magee
agreed
impatiently
go
ahead
where
you
find
women
peters
continued
there
you
find
things
beyond
understanding
history
get
to
the
point
well
yes
this
afternoon
i
was
looking
round
through
the
kitchen
sort
of
reconnoitering
you
might
say
and
finding
out
what
i
have
to
work
with
for
just
between
us
when
some
of
this
bunch
goes
i
easily
be
persuaded
to
come
back
and
cook
for
you
i
was
hunting
round
in
the
big
refrigerator
with
a
candle
thinking
maybe
some
little
token
of
food
had
been
left
over
from
last
summer
rush
something
in
a
can
that
time
can
not
wither
nor
custom
stale
as
the
poet
says
and
away
up
on
the
top
shelf
in
the
darkest
corner
i
found
a
little
package
quick
peters
cried
magee
where
is
that
package
now
i
coming
to
that
went
on
the
hermit
not
to
be
hurried
what
struck
me
first
about
the
thing
was
it
did
have
any
dust
on
it
i
says
or
words
to
that
effect
i
opened
it
what
do
you
think
was
in
it
i
do
have
to
think
i
know
said
magee
money
in
the
name
of
heaven
peters
tell
me
where
you
got
the
thing
just
a
minute
magee
let
me
tell
it
my
way
you
right
there
was
money
in
that
package
lots
of
it
enough
to
found
a
university
or
buy
a
woman
gowns
for
a
year
i
was
examining
it
when
a
shadow
came
in
the
doorway
i
looked
up
who
asked
magee
breathlessly
that
little
professor
bolton
was
standing
there
most
owlish
and
interested
he
came
into
the
refrigerator
package
you
have
in
your
hand
peters
he
says
to
me
i
put
it
in
cold
storage
so
it
would
keep
i
take
it
now
well
magee
i
a
peaceful
man
i
could
have
battered
that
professor
into
a
learned
sort
of
jelly
if
i
wanted
to
but
i
a
great
admirer
of
carnegie
on
account
of
the
library
and
i
go
in
for
peace
i
knew
it
was
exactly
the
thing
but
you
gave
him
the
package
that
hardly
the
way
i
would
put
it
magee
i
made
no
outcry
or
resistance
when
he
took
it
just
a
cook
i
says
this
house
i
ai
the
trusted
old
family
retainer
that
retains
its
fortunes
like
a
safety
deposit
vault
so
i
let
go
the
bundle
it
was
weak
of
me
i
know
but
i
sort
of
got
the
habit
of
giving
up
money
being
married
so
many
years
peters
said
magee
i
sorry
your
grip
was
so
insecure
but
mighty
glad
you
came
to
me
with
this
matter
he
told
me
i
was
to
mention
it
to
anybody
replied
the
hermit
but
as
i
say
i
sort
of
look
on
it
that
we
were
here
first
and
if
our
guests
get
to
chasing
untold
wealth
up
and
down
the
place
we
ought
to
let
each
other
in
on
it
correct
answered
magee
you
are
a
valuable
man
peters
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
appreciate
the
way
you
have
acted
in
this
affair
four
shadowy
figures
tramped
in
through
the
door
i
should
say
he
continued
that
the
menu
you
propose
for
dinner
will
prove
most
gratifying
what
oh
yes
sir
said
peters
is
that
all
quite
smiled
magee
unless
just
a
minute
this
may
concern
you
on
my
word
there
another
new
face
at
baldpate
he
stood
up
and
in
the
light
of
the
fire
met
hayden
now
he
saw
that
the
face
of
the
latest
comer
was
scheming
and
weak
and
that
under
a
small
blond
mustache
a
very
cruel
mouth
sought
to
hide
the
stranger
gazed
at
magee
with
an
annoyance
plainly
marked
a
friend
of
mine
er
downs
magee
muttered
bland
oh
come
now
smiled
magee
let
tell
our
real
names
i
heard
you
greeting
your
friend
a
minute
ago
how
are
you
mr
hayden
he
held
out
his
hand
hayden
looked
him
angrily
in
the
eyes
who
the
devil
are
you
he
asked
do
you
mean
said
magee
that
you
did
catch
the
name
magee
william
hallowell
magee
i
hold
a
record
hereabouts
hayden
i
spent
nearly
an
hour
at
baldpate
inn
alone
you
see
i
was
the
first
of
our
amiable
little
party
to
arrive
let
me
make
you
welcome
are
you
staying
to
dinner
you
must
i
not
growled
hayden
do
believe
him
magee
sneered
the
mayor
he
does
always
say
what
he
means
he
going
to
stay
all
right
yes
you
better
hayden
advised
bland
huh
delighted
i
sure
snapped
hayden
he
strolled
over
to
the
wall
and
in
the
light
of
the
fire
examined
a
picture
nonchalantly
the
pride
of
our
inn
magee
following
explained
pleasantly
the
admiral
it
is
within
these
very
walls
in
summer
that
he
plays
his
famous
game
of
solitaire
hayden
wheeled
quickly
and
looked
magee
in
the
eyes
a
flush
crossed
his
face
leaving
it
paler
than
before
he
turned
away
without
speaking
peters
said
magee
you
heard
what
hayden
said
an
extra
plate
at
dinner
please
i
must
leave
you
for
a
moment
gentlemen
he
saw
that
their
eyes
followed
him
eagerly
full
of
suspicion
menacing
we
shall
all
meet
again
very
shortly
hayden
slipped
quickly
between
magee
and
the
stairs
the
latter
faced
him
smilingly
reflecting
as
he
did
so
that
he
could
love
this
man
but
little
who
are
you
said
hayden
again
what
is
your
business
here
magee
laughed
outright
and
turned
to
the
other
men
how
unfortunate
he
said
this
gentleman
does
not
know
the
manners
and
customs
of
baldpate
in
winter
those
are
questions
hayden
that
we
are
never
impolite
enough
to
ask
of
one
another
up
here
he
moved
on
toward
the
stairs
and
reluctantly
hayden
got
out
of
his
path
i
am
very
happy
he
added
that
you
are
to
be
with
us
at
dinner
it
will
not
take
you
long
to
accustom
yourself
to
our
ways
i
sure
he
ran
up
the
stairs
and
passed
through
number
seven
out
upon
the
balcony
trudging
through
the
snow
he
soon
sighted
the
room
of
professor
bolton
and
as
he
did
so
a
little
shiver
that
was
not
due
to
atmospheric
conditions
ran
down
his
spine
for
one
of
the
windows
stood
wide
open
bidding
a
welcome
to
the
mountain
storm
peters
had
spoken
the
truth
once
more
that
tight
little
right
little
package
was
within
magee
ken
he
stepped
through
the
open
window
and
closed
it
after
him
by
the
table
sat
professor
bolton
wrapped
in
coats
and
blankets
reading
by
the
light
of
a
solitary
candle
the
book
was
held
almost
touching
his
nose
a
reminder
of
the
spectacles
that
were
gone
as
magee
entered
the
old
man
looked
up
and
a
very
obvious
expression
of
fright
crossed
his
face
good
evening
professor
said
magee
easily
do
you
find
it
rather
cool
with
the
window
open
magee
replied
the
much
wrapped
gentleman
i
am
that
rather
disturbing
progressive
a
fresh
air
devotee
i
feel
that
god
good
air
was
meant
to
be
breathed
not
barricaded
from
our
bodies
perhaps
suggested
magee
i
should
have
left
the
window
open
the
old
man
regarded
him
narrowly
i
have
no
wish
to
be
inhospitable
he
replied
but
if
you
please
certainly
answered
magee
he
threw
open
the
window
the
professor
held
up
his
book
i
was
passing
the
time
before
dinner
with
my
pleasant
old
companion
montaigne
magee
have
you
ever
read
his
essay
on
liars
never
said
magee
but
i
do
not
blame
you
for
brushing
up
on
it
at
the
present
time
professor
i
have
come
to
apologize
yesterday
morning
i
referred
in
a
rather
unpleasant
way
to
a
murder
in
the
chemical
laboratory
at
one
of
our
universities
i
said
that
the
professor
of
chemistry
was
missing
this
morning
paper
which
i
secured
from
peters
informs
me
that
he
has
been
apprehended
you
need
not
have
troubled
to
tell
me
said
the
old
man
he
smiled
his
bleak
smile
i
did
you
an
injustice
went
on
magee
let
us
say
no
more
of
it
pleaded
professor
bolton
magee
walked
about
the
room
warily
the
professor
turned
so
that
the
other
was
at
no
instant
at
his
back
he
looked
so
helpless
so
little
so
ineffectual
that
magee
abandoned
his
first
plan
of
leaping
upon
him
there
in
the
silence
by
more
subtle
means
than
this
must
his
purpose
be
attained
i
suppose
he
said
your
love
of
fresh
air
accounts
for
the
strolls
on
the
balcony
at
all
hours
of
the
night
the
old
man
merely
blinked
at
him
i
must
stop
magee
continued
i
just
wanted
to
make
my
apology
that
all
it
was
unjust
of
me
murder
that
is
hardly
in
your
line
by
the
way
were
you
by
any
chance
in
my
room
this
morning
professor
bolton
silence
pardon
me
remarked
the
professor
at
last
if
i
do
not
answer
in
this
very
essay
on
on
liars
montaigne
has
expressed
it
so
well
how
much
is
a
false
speech
less
sociable
than
silence
i
am
a
sociable
man
of
course
smiled
magee
he
stood
looking
down
at
the
frail
old
scholar
before
him
and
considered
of
what
avail
a
scuffle
there
in
that
chill
room
the
package
was
no
doubt
safely
hidden
in
a
corner
he
could
not
quickly
find
no
he
must
wait
and
watch
until
dinner
he
said
and
may
you
find
much
in
your
wise
companion
book
to
justify
your
conduct
he
went
out
through
the
open
window
and
in
another
moment
stood
just
outside
miss
norton
room
she
put
a
startled
head
out
at
his
knock
oh
it
you
she
said
i
ca
invite
you
in
you
might
learn
terrible
secrets
of
the
mamma
is
bedecking
herself
for
dinner
has
anything
happened
throw
something
over
your
head
juliet
smiled
magee
the
balcony
is
waiting
for
you
she
was
at
his
side
in
a
moment
and
they
walked
briskly
along
the
shadowy
white
floor
i
know
who
has
the
money
said
magee
softly
simply
through
a
turn
of
luck
i
know
i
realize
that
my
protestations
of
what
i
am
going
to
do
have
bored
you
but
it
looks
very
much
to
me
as
if
that
package
would
be
in
your
hands
very
soon
she
did
not
reply
and
when
i
have
got
it
and
have
given
it
to
you
if
i
do
he
continued
what
then
then
she
answered
i
must
go
away
very
quickly
and
no
one
must
know
or
they
will
try
to
stop
me
and
after
that
the
deluge
she
laughed
without
mirth
up
above
them
the
great
trees
of
baldpate
mountain
waved
their
black
arms
constantly
as
though
sparring
with
the
storm
at
the
foot
of
the
buried
roadway
they
could
see
the
lamps
of
upper
asquewan
falls
under
those
lamps
prosaic
citizens
were
hurrying
home
with
the
supper
groceries
through
the
night
and
not
one
of
those
citizens
was
within
miles
of
guessing
that
up
on
the
balcony
of
baldpate
inn
a
young
man
had
seized
a
young
woman
hand
and
was
saying
wildly
beautiful
girl
i
love
you
yet
that
was
exactly
what
billy
magee
was
doing
the
girl
had
turned
her
face
away
you
known
me
just
two
days
she
said
if
i
can
care
this
much
in
two
days
he
said
think
but
that
old
is
it
sometime
soon
i
going
to
say
to
you
girl
are
you
and
you
going
to
look
up
at
me
with
a
little
heaven
for
two
in
your
eyes
and
say
billy
magee
girl
so
before
we
go
any
further
i
must
confess
everything
i
must
tell
you
who
this
billy
magee
is
this
man
you
going
to
admit
you
belong
to
my
dear
you
read
the
future
glibly
she
replied
are
your
prophecies
true
i
wonder
absolutely
some
time
ago
on
my
soul
it
was
only
yesterday
i
asked
if
you
had
read
a
certain
novel
called
lost
and
you
said
you
had
and
that
it
was
sincere
well
i
wrote
it
oh
cried
the
girl
yes
said
magee
and
i
done
others
like
it
oh
yes
my
muse
has
been
a
lady
in
a
worth
gown
my
ambition
a
big
red
i
been
a
a
cent
mister
troubadour
beckoning
from
the
it
was
good
fun
writing
those
things
and
it
brought
me
more
money
than
was
good
for
me
i
not
ashamed
of
them
they
were
all
right
as
a
beginning
in
the
game
but
the
other
day
i
thought
an
advertisement
did
the
trick
i
turned
tired
of
that
sort
and
i
decided
to
try
the
other
kind
the
real
kind
i
thought
it
was
an
advertisement
that
did
it
but
i
see
now
it
was
because
you
were
just
a
few
days
away
do
tell
me
whispered
the
girl
that
you
came
up
here
to
to
yes
smiled
magee
i
came
up
here
to
forget
forever
the
world
giddy
melodrama
the
wild
chase
for
money
through
deserted
rooms
shots
in
the
night
cupid
in
the
middle
distance
i
came
here
to
do
literature
if
it
in
me
to
do
it
the
girl
leaned
limply
against
the
side
of
baldpate
inn
oh
the
irony
of
it
she
cried
i
know
he
said
it
ridiculous
i
think
all
this
is
meant
just
for
temptation
i
shall
be
firm
i
remember
your
parable
of
the
blind
girl
and
the
lamp
that
was
not
lighted
i
do
the
real
stuff
so
that
when
you
say
as
you
certainly
must
some
day
billy
girl
you
can
say
it
proudly
i
sure
she
said
softly
that
if
i
ever
do
say
it
oh
no
i
say
i
would
for
he
had
seized
her
hands
quickly
if
i
ever
do
say
it
it
will
certainly
be
proudly
but
now
you
do
even
know
my
name
my
right
one
you
do
know
what
i
do
nor
where
i
come
from
nor
what
i
want
with
this
disgusting
bundle
of
money
i
sort
of
feel
you
know
that
this
is
in
the
air
at
baldpate
even
in
the
winter
time
no
sooner
have
the
men
come
than
they
begin
to
talk
of
love
to
whatever
girls
they
find
here
on
this
very
balcony
down
there
under
the
trees
and
the
girls
listen
for
it
in
the
air
that
all
then
autumn
comes
and
everybody
laughs
and
forgets
may
not
our
autumn
come
when
i
go
away
never
cried
magee
this
is
no
summer
hotel
affair
to
me
it
a
real
in
winter
and
summer
love
my
dear
in
spring
and
fall
and
when
you
go
away
i
going
too
about
ten
feet
behind
yes
she
laughed
they
talk
that
way
at
baldpate
the
last
weeks
of
summer
it
part
of
the
game
they
had
come
to
the
side
of
the
hotel
on
which
was
the
annex
and
the
girl
stopped
and
pointed
look
she
whispered
breathlessly
in
a
window
of
the
annex
had
appeared
for
a
moment
a
flickering
yellow
light
but
only
for
a
moment
i
know
said
magee
there
somebody
in
there
but
that
important
in
comparison
this
is
no
summer
affair
dear
look
to
the
thermometer
for
proof
i
love
you
and
when
you
go
away
i
shall
follow
and
the
book
i
have
found
better
inspiration
than
baldpate
inn
they
walked
along
for
a
time
in
silence
you
forget
said
the
girl
you
only
know
who
has
the
money
i
will
get
it
he
answered
confidently
something
tells
me
i
will
until
i
do
i
am
content
to
say
no
more
said
the
girl
she
stood
in
the
window
of
her
room
while
a
harsh
voice
called
that
you
dearie
from
inside
and
i
may
add
she
smiled
that
in
my
profession
a
following
is
considered
quite
desirable
she
disappeared
and
magee
after
a
few
minutes
in
his
room
descended
again
to
the
office
in
the
center
of
the
room
elijah
quimby
and
hayden
stood
face
to
face
what
is
it
quimby
asked
magee
i
just
ran
up
to
see
how
things
were
going
quimby
replied
and
i
find
him
here
our
latest
guest
smiled
magee
i
was
just
reminding
hayden
quimby
said
his
teeth
set
an
angry
light
in
his
eyes
that
the
last
time
we
met
he
ordered
me
from
his
office
i
told
you
magee
that
the
suburban
railway
once
promised
to
make
use
of
my
invention
then
kendrick
went
away
and
this
man
took
charge
when
i
came
around
to
the
offices
again
he
laughed
at
me
when
i
came
the
second
time
he
called
me
a
loafer
and
ordered
me
out
he
paused
and
faced
hayden
again
i
grown
bitter
here
on
the
mountain
he
said
as
i
thought
over
what
you
and
men
like
you
said
to
me
as
i
thought
of
what
might
have
been
and
what
was
yes
i
grown
pretty
bitter
time
after
time
i
gone
over
in
my
mind
that
scene
in
your
office
as
i
sat
here
thinking
you
come
to
mean
to
me
all
the
crowd
that
made
a
fool
of
me
you
come
to
mean
to
me
all
the
crowd
that
said
public
be
in
my
ear
i
have
ever
forgot
how
you
ordered
me
out
of
your
office
well
asked
hayden
and
now
quimby
went
on
i
find
you
trespassing
in
a
hotel
left
in
my
care
the
tables
are
turned
i
ought
to
show
you
the
door
i
ought
to
put
you
out
try
it
sneered
hayden
no
answered
quimby
i
ai
going
to
do
it
maybe
it
because
grown
timid
brooding
over
my
failure
and
maybe
it
because
i
know
who
got
the
seventh
key
hayden
made
no
reply
no
one
stirred
for
a
minute
and
then
quimby
moved
away
and
went
out
through
the
door
chapter
xv
table
talk
the
seventh
key
magee
thrilled
at
the
mention
of
it
so
elijah
quimby
knew
the
identity
and
the
mission
of
the
man
who
hid
in
the
annex
did
any
one
else
magee
looked
at
the
broad
acreage
of
the
mayor
face
at
the
ancient
lemon
of
max
at
bland
frightened
and
thoughtful
at
hayden
concerned
but
smiling
did
any
one
else
know
ah
yes
of
course
down
the
stairs
the
professor
of
comparative
literature
felt
his
way
to
food
is
dinner
ready
he
asked
peering
about
the
candles
flickered
weakly
as
they
fought
the
stronger
shadows
winter
roared
at
the
windows
somewhere
above
a
door
crashed
shut
close
to
its
final
scene
drew
the
drama
at
baldpate
inn
magee
knew
it
he
could
not
have
told
why
the
others
seemed
to
know
it
too
in
silence
they
waited
while
the
hermit
scurried
along
his
dim
way
preparing
the
meal
in
silence
they
sat
while
miss
norton
and
her
mother
descended
once
there
was
a
little
flurry
of
interest
when
miss
thornhill
and
hayden
met
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
myra
hayden
cried
in
heaven
name
what
does
this
mean
unfortunately
said
the
girl
i
know
all
it
means
and
hayden
fell
back
into
the
shadows
finally
the
attitude
of
the
hermit
suggested
that
the
dinner
was
ready
i
guess
you
might
as
well
sit
down
he
remarked
it
all
fixed
what
there
is
to
fix
this
place
do
need
a
cook
it
needs
a
commissary
department
peters
reproved
magee
that
hardly
courteous
to
our
guests
living
alone
on
the
mountain
replied
the
hermit
from
the
door
you
get
to
have
such
a
high
regard
for
the
truth
you
ca
put
courtesy
first
you
want
to
but
you
have
the
heart
the
winter
guests
took
their
places
at
the
table
and
the
second
december
dinner
at
baldpate
inn
got
under
way
but
not
so
genially
as
on
the
previous
night
did
it
progress
on
the
faces
of
those
about
him
magee
noted
worry
and
suspicion
now
and
again
menacing
cold
eyes
were
turned
upon
him
evidently
first
in
the
thoughts
of
those
at
table
was
a
little
package
rich
in
treasure
and
evidently
first
in
the
thoughts
of
most
of
them
as
the
probable
holder
of
that
package
was
magee
himself
several
times
he
looked
up
to
find
max
eyes
upon
him
sinister
and
cruel
behind
the
incongruous
glasses
several
times
he
saw
hayden
eyes
hostile
and
angry
seek
his
face
they
were
desperate
they
would
stop
at
nothing
magee
felt
that
as
the
drama
drew
to
its
close
they
saw
him
and
him
alone
between
them
and
their
golden
desires
before
i
came
up
here
to
be
a
hermit
remarked
cargan
contemporaneously
with
the
removal
of
the
soup
which
i
may
say
in
passing
i
ai
been
able
to
be
with
any
success
owing
to
the
popularity
of
the
sport
on
baldpate
mountain
there
was
never
any
candles
on
the
table
where
i
et
no
sir
i
left
them
to
the
people
up
on
the
avenue
to
hayden
and
his
kind
that
like
to
work
in
dim
surroundings
i
was
always
strong
for
a
bright
light
on
my
food
what
i
afraid
of
is
that
i
get
the
habit
up
here
and
will
be
wanting
charlie
to
set
out
a
silver
candelabrum
with
my
lager
candles
be
quite
an
innovation
at
charlie
would
they
lou
too
swell
for
charlie
commented
max
except
after
closing
hours
i
seen
in
use
there
then
but
the
idea
was
glory
and
decoration
i
hope
you
do
dislike
the
candles
cargan
remarked
miss
norton
they
add
such
a
lot
to
the
romance
of
the
affair
do
you
think
i
terribly
thrilled
by
all
this
the
rattling
of
the
windows
and
the
flickering
light
two
lines
of
a
poem
keep
running
through
my
head
lord
he
followed
after
one
who
whispered
in
his
ear
the
weeping
of
the
candles
and
the
wind
is
all
i
hear
i
do
know
who
the
lord
was
nor
what
he
followed
perhaps
the
seventh
key
but
the
weeping
candles
and
the
wind
seem
so
romantic
and
so
like
baldpate
inn
if
i
had
a
daughter
your
age
commented
cargan
not
unkindly
be
at
home
reading
laura
jean
libbey
by
the
fire
and
not
chasing
after
romance
on
a
mountain
that
would
be
best
for
her
i
sure
replied
the
girl
sweetly
for
then
she
would
be
likely
to
find
out
things
about
her
father
that
would
prove
disquieting
dearie
cried
norton
no
one
else
spoke
but
all
looked
at
the
mayor
he
was
busily
engaged
with
his
food
smiling
his
amusement
magee
sought
to
direct
the
conversation
into
less
personal
channels
we
hear
so
much
about
romance
especially
since
its
widely
advertised
death
he
said
and
to
every
man
i
ever
met
it
meant
something
different
cargan
speaking
as
a
man
of
the
world
what
does
romance
mean
to
you
the
mayor
ran
his
fingers
through
his
graying
hair
and
considered
seriously
romance
he
reflected
well
i
ai
much
on
the
talk
out
of
books
but
here
what
i
see
when
you
say
that
word
to
me
it
the
night
before
election
and
i
standing
in
the
front
window
of
the
little
room
on
main
street
where
the
boys
can
always
find
me
down
the
street
i
hear
the
snarl
and
rumble
of
bands
and
pretty
soon
i
see
the
yellow
flicker
of
torches
like
the
flicker
of
that
candle
and
the
bobbing
of
banners
and
then
the
boys
march
by
all
the
boys
pat
doherty
and
bob
larsen
and
matt
sanders
all
the
boys
and
when
they
get
to
my
window
they
wave
their
hats
and
cheer
just
a
fat
old
man
in
that
window
but
they
go
to
the
pavement
with
any
guy
that
knocks
him
they
loyal
they
for
me
and
so
they
march
by
cheering
and
singing
all
the
boys
just
for
me
to
see
and
hear
well
that
that
romance
to
me
power
translated
magee
yes
sir
cried
the
mayor
i
know
i
got
them
all
the
reformers
in
the
world
ca
spoil
my
thrill
then
they
mine
i
guess
old
napoleon
knew
that
thrill
i
guess
he
was
the
greatest
romancer
the
world
ever
knew
when
he
marched
over
the
mountains
with
his
starving
bunch
and
looked
back
and
saw
them
in
rags
and
suffering
for
him
well
i
reckon
old
nap
was
as
close
to
romance
then
as
any
man
ever
gets
i
wonder
answered
magee
it
came
to
him
suddenly
that
in
each
person
definition
of
this
intangible
thing
might
lie
exposed
something
of
both
character
and
calling
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
lined
tired
face
met
his
gaze
to
her
he
put
his
question
well
she
answered
and
her
voice
seemed
softer
than
its
wont
i
ai
thought
much
of
that
word
for
a
good
many
years
now
but
when
i
do
say
i
seem
to
see
myself
sitting
on
our
porch
back
home
thirty
years
ago
i
got
on
a
simple
little
muslin
dress
and
i
slender
as
elsie
janis
and
the
color
in
my
cheeks
is
well
it
the
sort
that
norton
likes
and
my
hair
but
i
thinking
of
him
of
norton
told
me
he
wants
to
make
me
happy
for
life
and
i
about
decided
let
him
try
i
see
him
coming
up
our
front
walk
coming
to
call
on
me
have
i
mentioned
i
got
a
figure
a
real
sweet
figure
about
what
romance
means
to
me
youth
dear
asks
miss
norton
gently
that
it
dearie
answered
the
older
woman
dreamily
youth
for
a
time
those
about
the
table
sat
in
silence
picturing
no
doubt
the
slender
figure
on
the
steps
of
that
porch
long
ago
not
without
a
humorous
sort
of
pity
did
they
glance
occasionally
toward
the
woman
whom
norton
had
begged
to
make
happy
the
professor
of
comparative
literature
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
the
dictionary
he
remarked
academically
would
define
romance
as
a
species
of
fictitious
writing
originally
composed
in
the
romance
dialects
and
afterward
in
prose
but
the
dictionary
is
prosaic
it
has
no
soul
shall
i
tell
you
what
romance
means
to
me
i
will
i
see
a
man
toiling
in
a
dim
laboratory
where
there
are
strange
fires
and
stranger
odors
night
and
day
he
experiments
the
love
of
his
kind
in
his
eyes
a
desire
to
help
in
his
heart
and
then
the
golden
moment
the
great
moment
in
that
quiet
dreary
cell
the
moment
of
the
discovery
a
serum
a
formula
what
not
he
gives
it
to
the
world
and
a
few
of
the
sick
are
well
again
and
a
few
of
the
sorrowful
are
glad
romance
means
neither
youth
nor
power
to
me
it
means
service
he
bent
his
dim
old
eyes
on
his
food
and
magee
gazed
at
him
with
a
new
wonder
odd
sentiments
these
from
an
old
man
who
robbed
fireplaces
held
up
hermits
and
engaged
in
midnight
conferences
by
the
annex
door
more
than
ever
magee
was
baffled
enthralled
amused
now
max
leered
about
the
table
and
contributed
his
unsavory
bit
funny
ai
it
he
remarked
the
different
things
the
same
word
means
to
a
bunch
of
folks
say
romance
to
me
and
i
do
see
no
dim
laboratory
i
do
see
nothing
dim
i
see
the
brightest
lights
in
the
world
and
the
best
food
and
somebody
maybe
dancing
the
latest
freak
dance
in
between
the
tables
and
an
orchestra
playing
in
the
distance
classy
dames
all
about
a
taxi
clicking
at
the
door
and
me
sending
word
to
the
chauffeur
her
click
till
the
milk
carts
rumble
i
can
pay
say
that
sure
is
romance
to
me
hayden
remarked
magee
are
we
to
hear
from
you
hayden
hesitated
and
looked
for
a
moment
into
the
black
eyes
of
myra
thornhill
my
idea
has
often
been
contradicted
he
said
keeping
his
gaze
on
the
girl
it
may
be
again
but
to
me
the
greatest
romance
in
the
world
is
the
romance
of
money
making
dollar
piling
on
dollar
in
the
vaults
of
the
man
who
started
with
a
and
hope
and
nerve
i
see
him
fighting
for
the
first
thousand
and
then
i
see
his
pile
growing
slowly
at
first
faster
faster
faster
until
a
brings
him
to
his
office
and
men
speak
his
name
with
awe
in
the
streets
money
commented
miss
thornhill
contemptuously
what
an
idea
of
romance
for
a
man
i
did
not
expect
replied
hayden
that
my
definition
would
pass
unchallenged
my
past
experiences
he
looked
meaningly
at
the
girl
had
led
me
to
be
prepared
for
that
but
it
is
my
definition
i
spoke
the
truth
you
must
give
me
credit
for
that
i
ai
one
to
blame
you
sneered
cargan
for
wanting
it
noticed
when
you
do
a
lie
yes
i
certainly
see
here
cargan
blazed
hayden
yes
you
did
speak
the
truth
put
in
miss
thornhill
hastily
you
mentioned
one
word
in
your
definition
it
was
a
desecration
to
drag
it
in
hope
for
me
romance
means
only
hope
and
i
afraid
there
are
a
pitiful
number
in
the
world
to
whom
it
means
the
same
we
ai
heard
from
the
young
woman
who
started
all
this
fuss
over
a
little
word
cargan
reminded
them
that
right
dearie
said
norton
you
got
to
contribute
yes
agreed
the
girl
with
the
locks
crisped
like
golden
wire
i
will
but
it
hard
one
ideas
change
so
rapidly
a
moment
ago
if
you
had
said
romance
to
me
i
might
have
babbled
of
shady
corners
of
whisperings
on
the
stair
of
walks
down
the
mountain
in
the
moonlight
or
even
on
the
hotel
balcony
she
smiled
gaily
at
magee
perhaps
too
the
word
might
mean
such
rapturous
things
to
me
but
life
is
too
real
and
earnest
service
professor
bolton
was
right
service
is
often
romance
it
may
mean
the
discovery
of
a
serum
it
may
mean
so
cruel
a
thing
as
the
blighting
of
another
life
romance
she
gazed
steadily
at
the
stolid
cargan
it
may
mean
putting
an
end
forever
to
those
picturesque
parades
past
the
window
of
the
little
room
on
main
street
the
room
where
the
boys
can
always
find
the
mayor
of
reuton
still
she
gazed
steadily
into
cargan
eyes
and
with
an
amused
smile
the
mayor
gazed
back
you
would
be
so
cruel
as
that
he
assured
her
easily
a
nice
attractive
girl
like
you
the
dinner
was
at
an
end
without
a
word
the
sly
little
professor
rose
from
the
table
and
hurriedly
ascended
the
stairs
magee
watched
him
disappear
and
resolved
to
follow
quickly
on
his
heels
but
first
he
paused
to
give
his
own
version
of
the
word
under
discussion
strange
he
remarked
that
none
of
you
gets
the
picture
i
do
romance
it
is
here
at
your
feet
in
baldpate
inn
a
man
climbs
the
mountain
to
be
alone
with
his
thoughts
to
forget
the
melodrama
of
life
to
get
away
from
the
swift
action
of
the
world
and
meditate
he
is
alone
for
very
near
an
hour
then
a
telephone
bell
tinkles
and
a
youth
rises
out
of
the
dark
to
prate
of
a
lost
arabella
and
haberdashery
a
shot
rings
out
as
the
immemorial
custom
with
shots
and
in
comes
a
professor
of
comparative
literature
with
a
perforation
in
his
derby
hat
a
professional
hermit
arrives
to
teach
the
amateur
the
fine
points
of
the
game
a
charming
maid
comes
in
too
late
for
breakfast
but
in
plenty
of
time
for
walks
on
the
balcony
in
the
moonlight
the
mayor
of
a
municipality
condescends
to
stay
for
dinner
a
battle
in
the
snow
ensues
there
is
a
weird
talk
of
a
sum
of
money
more
guests
arrive
dark
hints
of
a
seventh
key
why
bless
you
you
need
stir
from
baldpate
inn
in
search
of
your
romance
he
crossed
the
floor
hastily
and
put
one
foot
on
the
lower
step
of
baldpate
grand
stairway
he
kept
it
there
for
from
the
shadows
of
the
landing
professor
bolton
emerged
his
blasted
derby
once
more
on
his
head
his
overcoat
buttoned
tight
his
in
place
his
and
green
umbrella
in
tow
what
professor
cried
magee
you
leaving
now
truly
the
end
of
the
drama
had
come
magee
felt
his
heart
beat
wildly
what
was
the
end
to
be
what
did
this
calm
departure
mean
surely
the
little
man
descending
the
stair
was
not
thrusting
himself
into
this
lion
den
with
the
precious
package
in
his
possession
yes
the
old
man
was
saying
slowly
i
am
about
to
leave
the
decision
came
suddenly
i
am
sorry
to
go
certainly
i
have
enjoyed
these
chance
meetings
see
here
doc
said
mr
bland
uneasily
feeling
of
his
purple
tie
you
not
going
back
and
let
them
reporters
have
another
fling
at
you
i
fear
i
must
replied
the
old
man
my
duty
calls
yes
they
will
hound
me
i
shall
hear
much
of
peroxide
blondes
i
shall
be
asked
again
to
name
the
ten
greatest
in
history
a
difficult
not
to
say
dangerous
task
but
i
must
face
the
er
music
as
the
vulgar
expression
goes
i
bid
you
mr
bland
we
part
friends
i
am
sure
again
be
comforted
by
the
thought
that
i
do
not
hold
the
ruined
derby
against
you
even
though
as
i
have
remarked
with
unpleasant
truth
the
honorarium
of
a
professor
at
our
university
is
not
large
he
turned
to
magee
i
regret
more
than
i
can
say
he
continued
parting
from
you
my
eyes
fell
upon
you
first
on
entering
this
place
we
have
had
exciting
times
together
my
dear
miss
norton
knowing
you
has
refreshed
an
old
heart
i
might
compare
you
to
another
with
yellow
locks
but
i
leave
that
to
my
younger
er
colleagues
cargan
my
acquaintance
with
you
i
shall
always
look
back
on
but
the
mayor
of
reuton
max
and
bland
closed
in
on
the
old
man
now
look
here
doc
interrupted
cargan
you
bluffing
do
you
get
me
you
trying
to
put
something
over
i
do
want
to
be
rough
i
like
you
but
i
got
to
get
a
glimpse
at
the
inside
of
that
satchel
and
i
got
to
examine
your
personal
a
bit
dear
dear
smiled
professor
bolton
you
do
think
i
would
steal
a
man
in
my
position
absurd
look
through
my
poor
luggage
if
you
desire
you
will
find
nothing
but
the
usual
appurtenances
of
travel
he
stood
docilely
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
blinked
at
the
group
around
him
magee
waited
to
hear
no
more
it
was
quite
apparent
that
this
wise
little
man
carried
no
package
wildly
sought
by
baldpate
winter
guests
quietly
and
quickly
magee
disappeared
up
the
broad
stair
and
tried
the
professor
door
it
was
locked
inside
he
could
hear
a
window
banging
back
and
forth
in
the
storm
he
ran
through
number
seven
and
out
upon
the
balcony
there
he
bumped
full
into
a
shadowy
figure
hurrying
in
the
opposite
direction
chapter
xvi
a
man
from
the
dark
for
fully
five
seconds
magee
and
the
man
with
whom
he
had
collided
stood
facing
each
other
on
the
balcony
the
identical
moon
of
the
summer
romances
now
hung
in
the
sky
and
in
its
white
glare
baldpate
mountain
glittered
like
a
suddenly
the
wind
broke
a
small
branch
from
one
of
the
trees
and
tossed
it
lightly
on
the
snow
beside
the
two
men
as
though
it
were
a
signal
for
battle
a
lucky
chance
said
magee
you
a
man
i
been
longing
to
meet
especially
since
the
professor
left
his
window
open
this
afternoon
indeed
replied
the
other
calmly
may
i
ask
what
you
want
of
me
certainly
magee
laughed
a
little
package
i
think
it
in
your
pocket
at
this
minute
a
package
no
bigger
than
a
man
hand
the
stranger
made
no
reply
but
looked
quickly
about
over
his
shoulder
at
the
path
along
which
he
had
come
and
then
past
magee
at
the
road
that
led
to
freedom
i
think
it
in
your
pocket
repeated
magee
and
i
going
to
find
out
i
have
time
to
argue
with
you
said
the
holder
of
the
seventh
key
his
voice
was
cold
calculating
harsh
get
out
of
my
way
and
let
me
pass
or
or
what
asked
billy
magee
he
watched
the
man
lunge
toward
him
in
the
moonlight
he
saw
the
fist
that
had
the
night
before
been
the
waterloo
of
max
and
the
mayor
start
on
a
swift
true
course
for
his
head
quickly
he
dodged
to
one
side
and
closed
with
his
opponent
back
and
forth
through
the
snow
they
ploughed
panting
grappling
straining
magee
soon
realized
that
his
adversary
was
no
weakling
he
was
forced
to
call
into
play
muscles
he
had
not
used
in
what
seemed
ages
not
since
he
sported
of
an
afternoon
in
a
rather
odorous
college
gymnasium
in
moonlight
and
shadow
up
and
down
they
reeled
staggered
stumbled
the
sole
jarring
notes
in
that
picture
of
baldpate
on
a
quiet
winter
night
you
queered
the
game
last
time
muttered
the
stranger
but
never
queer
it
again
magee
saved
his
breath
together
they
crashed
against
the
side
of
the
inn
together
they
squirmed
away
across
the
balcony
to
the
railing
still
back
and
forth
now
in
the
moonlight
now
in
shadow
wildly
they
fought
once
magee
felt
his
feet
slip
from
beneath
him
but
caught
himself
in
time
his
strength
was
going
surely
quickly
then
suddenly
his
opponent
seemed
to
weaken
in
his
grip
with
a
supreme
effort
magee
forced
him
down
upon
the
balcony
floor
and
tumbled
on
top
of
him
he
felt
the
chill
of
the
snow
under
his
knees
and
its
wetness
in
his
cuffs
now
he
cried
to
himself
the
other
still
struggled
desperately
but
his
struggle
was
without
success
for
deftly
billy
magee
drew
from
his
pocket
the
precious
package
about
which
there
had
been
so
much
debate
on
baldpate
mountain
he
clasped
it
close
rose
and
ran
in
another
second
he
was
inside
number
seven
and
had
lighted
a
candle
at
the
blazing
logs
once
more
he
examined
that
closely
packed
little
bundle
once
more
he
found
it
rich
in
greenbacks
assuredly
it
was
the
greatly
desired
thing
he
had
fought
for
the
night
before
he
had
it
again
and
this
time
he
told
himself
he
would
not
lose
sight
of
it
until
he
had
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
the
girl
of
the
station
the
dark
shadow
of
the
man
he
had
just
robbed
was
hovering
at
his
windows
magee
turned
hastily
to
the
door
as
he
did
so
it
opened
and
hayden
entered
he
carried
a
pistol
in
his
hand
his
face
was
hard
cruel
determined
his
usually
expressionless
eyes
lighted
with
pleasure
as
they
fell
on
the
package
in
magee
possession
it
seems
i
just
in
time
he
said
to
prevent
highway
robbery
you
think
so
asked
magee
see
here
young
man
remarked
hayden
glancing
nervously
over
his
shoulder
i
ca
waste
any
time
in
talk
does
that
money
belong
to
you
no
well
it
does
belong
to
me
i
going
to
have
it
do
think
i
afraid
to
shoot
to
get
it
the
law
permits
a
man
to
fire
on
the
thief
who
tries
to
fleece
him
the
law
did
you
say
laughed
billy
magee
i
would
drag
the
law
into
this
if
i
were
you
hayden
i
sure
it
has
no
connection
with
events
on
baldpate
mountain
you
would
be
the
last
to
want
its
attention
to
be
directed
here
i
got
this
money
and
i
going
to
keep
it
hayden
considered
a
brief
moment
and
then
swore
under
his
breath
you
right
he
said
i
not
going
to
shoot
but
there
are
other
ways
you
he
dropped
the
revolver
into
his
pocket
and
sprang
forward
for
the
second
time
within
ten
minutes
magee
steadied
himself
for
conflict
but
hayden
stopped
some
one
had
entered
the
room
through
the
window
behind
magee
in
the
dim
light
of
the
single
candle
magee
saw
face
go
white
his
lip
twitch
his
eyes
glaze
with
horrible
surprise
his
arms
fell
limply
to
his
sides
good
god
kendrick
he
cried
the
voice
of
the
man
with
whom
billy
magee
had
but
a
moment
before
struggled
on
the
balcony
answered
yes
hayden
i
back
hayden
wet
his
lips
with
his
tongue
what
what
brought
you
he
asked
his
voice
trailing
off
weakly
on
the
last
word
what
brought
me
suddenly
as
from
a
volcano
that
had
long
been
cold
fire
blazed
up
in
kendrick
eyes
if
a
man
knew
the
road
from
hell
back
home
what
would
it
need
to
bring
him
back
hayden
stood
with
his
mouth
partly
open
almost
a
grotesque
picture
of
terror
he
looked
in
that
dim
light
then
he
spoke
in
an
odd
strained
tone
more
to
himself
than
to
any
one
else
i
thought
you
were
dead
he
said
i
told
myself
you
never
come
back
over
and
over
in
the
night
i
told
myself
that
but
all
the
time
i
knew
i
knew
you
come
a
cry
a
woman
cry
sounded
from
just
outside
the
door
of
number
seven
into
the
room
came
myra
thornhill
quickly
she
crossed
and
took
kendrick
hands
in
hers
david
she
sobbed
oh
david
is
it
a
dream
a
wonderful
dream
kendrick
looked
into
her
eyes
sheepishly
at
first
then
gladly
as
he
saw
what
was
in
them
for
the
light
there
under
the
tears
was
such
as
no
man
could
mistake
magee
saw
it
hayden
saw
it
too
and
his
voice
was
even
more
lifeless
when
he
spoke
forgive
me
david
he
said
i
did
mean
and
then
as
he
saw
that
kendrick
did
not
listen
he
turned
and
walked
quietly
into
the
bedroom
of
number
seven
taking
no
notice
of
cargan
and
bland
who
with
the
other
winter
guests
of
baldpate
now
crowded
the
doorway
leading
to
the
hall
hayden
closed
the
bedroom
door
magee
and
the
others
stood
silent
wondering
their
answer
came
quickly
the
sharp
cry
of
a
revolver
behind
that
closed
door
it
was
magee
who
went
into
the
bedroom
the
moonlight
streamed
in
through
the
low
windows
and
fell
brightly
on
the
bed
across
this
hayden
lay
magee
made
sure
it
was
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
make
sure
of
then
he
took
the
revolver
from
the
hand
that
still
clasped
it
covered
the
quiet
figure
on
the
bed
and
stepped
back
into
the
outer
room
he
he
has
killed
himself
he
said
in
a
low
voice
closing
the
bedroom
door
behind
him
there
was
a
moment
frightened
hush
then
the
voice
of
kendrick
rang
out
killed
himself
i
do
understand
why
should
he
do
that
surely
not
because
no
he
looked
questioningly
into
the
white
face
of
the
girl
at
his
side
she
only
shook
her
head
killed
himself
he
repeated
like
a
man
wakened
from
sleep
i
do
understand
on
tiptoe
the
amateur
hermits
of
baldpate
descended
to
the
hotel
office
magee
saw
the
eyes
of
the
girl
of
the
station
upon
him
wide
with
doubt
and
alarm
while
the
others
gathered
in
little
groups
and
talked
he
took
her
to
one
side
when
does
the
next
train
leave
for
reuton
he
asked
her
in
two
hours
at
she
replied
you
must
be
on
it
he
told
her
with
you
will
go
the
package
i
have
it
in
my
pocket
now
she
took
the
news
stolidly
and
made
no
reply
are
you
afraid
asked
magee
gently
you
must
be
no
harm
can
touch
you
i
shall
stay
here
and
see
that
no
one
follows
i
not
afraid
she
replied
just
startled
that
all
did
he
did
he
do
it
because
you
took
this
money
because
he
was
afraid
of
what
would
happen
you
mean
hayden
magee
said
no
this
money
was
not
concerned
in
his
death
that
is
an
affair
between
kendrick
and
him
i
see
answered
the
girl
slowly
i
so
glad
it
was
the
money
i
could
bear
it
if
it
were
may
i
call
your
attention
remarked
magee
to
the
fact
that
the
long
reign
of
going
to
is
ended
and
the
rule
of
done
it
has
begun
i
actually
got
the
money
somehow
it
does
seem
to
thrill
you
the
way
i
thought
it
would
but
it
does
oh
it
does
cried
the
girl
i
was
upset
for
a
moment
it
glorious
news
and
with
you
on
guard
here
i
not
afraid
to
carry
it
away
down
the
mountain
and
to
reuton
i
be
with
you
in
a
moment
ready
for
the
journey
she
called
norton
and
the
two
went
rather
timidly
together
magee
turned
to
his
companions
in
the
room
and
mentally
called
their
roll
they
were
all
there
the
professor
the
mayor
max
bland
peters
miss
thornhill
and
the
newcomer
kendrick
a
man
prematurely
old
grayed
at
the
temples
and
with
a
face
yellowed
by
fever
he
and
the
professor
were
talking
earnestly
together
and
now
the
old
man
came
and
stood
before
magee
magee
he
said
seriously
i
learn
from
kendrick
that
you
have
in
your
possession
a
certain
package
of
money
that
has
been
much
buffeted
about
here
at
baldpate
inn
now
i
suggest
no
i
demand
pardon
me
professor
magee
interrupted
i
have
something
to
suggest
even
to
demand
it
is
that
you
and
every
one
else
present
select
a
chair
and
sit
down
i
suggest
though
i
do
not
demand
that
you
pick
comfortable
chairs
for
the
vigil
that
you
are
about
to
begin
will
prove
a
long
one
what
mean
asked
the
mayor
of
reuton
coming
militantly
to
professor
bolton
side
magee
did
not
reply
miss
norton
and
her
mother
came
down
the
stair
the
former
wrapped
in
a
great
coat
she
stood
on
the
bottom
step
her
cheeks
flushed
her
eyes
ablaze
magee
going
to
her
side
reflected
that
she
looked
charming
and
wonderful
and
wished
he
had
time
to
admire
but
he
had
he
took
from
one
pocket
the
pistol
he
had
removed
from
the
hand
of
hayden
from
the
other
the
celebrated
package
of
money
i
warn
you
all
he
said
i
will
shoot
any
one
who
makes
a
move
for
this
bundle
miss
norton
is
going
to
take
it
away
with
her
she
is
to
catch
the
train
for
reuton
the
train
arrives
at
its
destination
at
twelve
much
as
it
pains
me
to
say
it
no
one
will
leave
this
room
before
you
crook
roared
cargan
magee
smiled
as
he
put
the
package
in
the
girl
hand
possibly
he
said
but
cargan
the
blackness
of
the
kettle
always
has
annoyed
the
pot
do
not
be
afraid
he
added
to
the
girl
every
gentleman
in
this
room
is
to
spend
the
evening
with
me
you
will
not
be
annoyed
in
any
way
he
looked
around
the
menacing
circle
go
he
said
and
may
the
gods
of
the
mountain
take
care
of
you
the
little
professor
of
comparative
literature
stepped
forward
and
stood
pompously
before
magee
one
moment
he
remarked
before
you
steal
this
money
in
front
of
our
very
eyes
i
want
to
inform
you
who
i
am
and
who
i
represent
here
this
is
no
time
replied
magee
for
light
talk
on
the
subject
of
blondes
this
is
the
time
said
the
professor
warmly
for
me
to
tell
you
that
kendrick
here
and
myself
represent
at
baldpate
inn
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
reuton
county
we
cargan
big
red
volcanic
interrupted
drayton
he
bellowed
drayton
sent
you
here
the
rat
the
pup
why
i
made
that
kid
i
put
him
where
he
is
he
wo
dare
touch
me
wo
he
returned
professor
bolton
my
dear
sir
you
are
mistaken
drayton
fully
intends
to
prosecute
you
on
the
ground
that
you
arranged
to
pass
ordinance
number
granting
the
suburban
railway
the
privilege
of
merging
with
the
civic
in
exchange
for
this
bribe
of
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
he
wo
dare
cried
cargan
i
made
him
before
election
said
the
professor
i
believe
he
often
insisted
to
you
that
he
would
do
his
duty
as
he
saw
it
of
course
he
did
replied
cargan
but
that
what
they
all
say
he
intends
to
keep
his
word
the
mayor
of
reuton
slid
into
the
shadows
to
think
he
do
this
thing
to
me
he
whined
after
all
i
done
for
him
as
i
was
saying
magee
continued
the
professor
kendrick
and
i
came
up
here
to
secure
this
package
of
money
as
evidence
against
cargan
and
the
man
above
i
speak
with
the
voice
of
the
law
when
i
say
you
must
turn
this
money
over
to
me
for
answer
magee
smiled
at
the
girl
you
better
go
now
he
said
it
a
long
walk
down
the
mountain
you
refuse
cried
the
professor
absolutely
do
we
miss
norton
said
magee
absolutely
she
repeated
bravely
then
sir
announced
the
old
man
crushingly
you
are
little
better
than
a
thief
and
this
girl
is
your
accomplice
so
it
must
look
on
the
face
of
it
assented
magee
the
girl
moved
to
the
big
front
door
and
magee
with
his
eyes
still
on
the
room
backed
away
until
he
stood
beside
her
he
handed
her
his
key
i
give
you
he
said
to
the
gods
of
the
mountain
but
it
only
a
loan
i
shall
surely
want
you
back
i
ca
follow
ten
feet
behind
as
i
threatened
it
will
be
ten
hours
instead
good
night
and
good
luck
she
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
billy
magee
she
whispered
yours
is
a
faith
beyond
understanding
i
shall
tell
the
gods
of
the
mountain
that
i
am
to
be
returned
good
night
you
dear
she
went
out
quickly
and
magee
locking
the
door
after
her
thrust
the
key
into
his
pocket
for
a
moment
no
one
stirred
then
max
leaped
up
and
ran
through
the
flickering
light
to
the
nearest
window
there
was
a
flash
a
report
and
max
came
back
into
the
firelight
examining
a
torn
trousers
leg
i
do
mean
to
kill
anybody
explained
magee
just
to
wing
them
but
i
not
an
expert
i
might
shoot
higher
than
i
intend
so
i
suggest
that
no
one
else
try
a
break
for
it
magee
said
miss
thornhill
i
do
believe
you
have
the
slightest
idea
who
that
girl
is
nor
what
she
wants
with
the
money
that
he
replied
makes
it
all
the
more
exciting
do
you
think
do
you
mean
the
professor
exploded
you
do
know
her
well
you
young
fool
it
rather
fine
of
you
remarked
miss
thornhill
it
asinine
if
it
true
the
professor
voiced
the
other
side
of
it
you
have
said
yourself
or
at
least
you
claim
to
have
said
magee
reminded
him
one
girl
like
that
is
worth
a
million
suffragettes
and
can
make
just
as
much
trouble
complained
professor
bolton
i
shall
certainly
see
to
it
that
the
hermit
book
has
an
honored
place
in
our
college
library
out
of
the
big
chair
into
which
he
had
sunk
came
the
wail
of
the
uncomprehending
cargan
he
done
this
thing
to
me
after
all
i
done
for
him
i
hope
every
one
is
quite
comfortable
remarked
magee
selecting
a
seat
facing
the
crowd
it
to
be
a
long
wait
you
know
there
was
no
answer
the
wind
roared
lustily
at
the
windows
the
firelight
flickered
redly
on
the
faces
of
magee
prisoners

struck
nine
magee
on
guard
in
baldpate
dreary
office
counted
the
strokes
she
must
be
down
the
mountain
now
perhaps
at
this
very
moment
she
heard
quimby
ancient
gate
creaking
in
the
wind
he
could
almost
see
her
as
she
tramped
along
through
the
snow
the
lovely
heroine
of
the
most
romantic
walk
of
all
romantic
walks
on
baldpate
to
date
to
the
where
she
had
wept
so
bitterly
to
the
curious
station
agent
with
the
mop
of
ginger
hair
there
would
be
no
need
of
a
troubadour
to
implore
weep
no
more
my
lady
william
hallowell
magee
had
removed
the
cause
for
tears
it
was
a
long
vigil
he
had
begun
but
there
was
no
boredom
in
it
for
billy
magee
he
was
too
great
a
lover
of
contrast
for
that
as
he
looked
around
on
the
group
he
guarded
he
compared
them
with
the
happier
people
of
the
inn
summer
nights
about
whom
the
girl
had
told
him
instead
of
these
surly
or
sad
folk
sitting
glumly
under
the
pistol
of
romantic
youth
he
saw
maids
garbed
in
the
magic
of
muslin
flit
through
the
shadows
lights
glowed
softly
a
waltz
came
up
from
the
casino
on
the
breath
of
the
summer
breeze
under
the
red
and
white
awnings
youth
and
joy
and
love
had
their
day
or
their
night
the
hermit
was
on
hand
with
his
romance
the
trees
gossiped
in
whispers
on
the
mountain
and
too
the
fleet
gossiped
in
whispers
on
the
veranda
pausing
only
when
the
admiral
sailed
by
in
his
glory
eagerly
it
ran
down
its
game
this
girl
this
myra
thornhill
he
remembered
had
herself
been
a
victim
after
kendrick
disappeared
she
had
come
there
no
more
for
there
were
ugly
rumors
of
the
man
who
had
fled
magee
saw
the
girl
and
her
lover
whispering
together
in
the
firelight
he
wondered
if
they
too
imagined
themselves
at
baldpate
in
the
summer
if
they
heard
the
waltz
in
the
casino
and
the
laughter
of
men
in
the
ten
said
the
town
hall
pompously
she
was
at
the
station
now
in
the
room
of
her
tears
she
was
waiting
perhaps
her
only
companion
the
jacky
of
the
see
the
world
poster
whose
garb
was
but
a
shade
bluer
than
her
eyes
who
was
she
what
was
the
bribe
money
of
the
suburban
railway
to
her
magee
did
not
know
but
he
trusted
her
and
he
was
glad
she
had
won
through
him
he
saw
professor
bolton
walk
through
the
flickering
to
join
myra
thornhill
and
kendrick
it
must
be
half
past
by
now
yes
from
far
below
in
the
valley
came
the
whistle
of
a
train
now
she
was
boarding
it
she
and
the
money
boarding
it
for
where
for
what
purpose
again
the
train
whistled
the
siege
remarked
magee
is
more
than
half
over
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
professor
of
comparative
literature
approached
him
and
took
a
chair
at
his
side
i
want
to
talk
with
you
magee
he
said
a
welcome
diversion
assented
magee
his
eyes
still
on
the
room
i
have
discussed
matters
with
miss
thornhill
said
the
professor
in
a
low
voice
she
has
convinced
me
that
in
this
affair
you
have
acted
from
a
wholly
disinterested
point
of
view
a
mistaken
idea
of
chivalry
perhaps
the
infatuation
of
the
moment
for
a
pretty
face
a
thing
to
which
all
men
with
red
blood
in
their
veins
are
susceptible
a
pleasant
thing
that
i
would
be
the
last
to
want
banished
from
the
world
miss
thornhill
replied
billy
magee
has
sized
up
the
situation
perfectly
except
for
one
rather
important
detail
it
is
not
the
infatuation
of
the
moment
professor
say
rather
that
of
a
lifetime
ah
yes
the
old
man
returned
youth
how
sure
it
always
is
of
that
i
do
not
deprecate
the
feeling
once
long
ago
i
too
had
youth
and
faith
we
will
not
dwell
on
that
however
miss
thornhill
assures
me
that
henry
bentley
the
son
of
my
friend
john
bentley
esteems
you
highly
she
asserts
that
you
are
in
every
respect
as
far
as
her
knowledge
goes
an
admirable
young
man
i
feel
sure
that
after
calm
contemplation
you
will
see
that
what
you
have
done
is
very
unfortunate
the
package
of
money
which
in
a
giddy
moment
you
have
given
into
a
young
lady
keeping
is
much
desired
by
the
authorities
as
evidence
against
a
very
corrupt
political
ring
i
am
certain
that
when
you
know
all
the
details
you
will
be
glad
to
return
with
me
to
reuton
and
do
all
in
your
power
to
help
us
regain
possession
of
that
package
and
now
the
town
hall
informed
magee
that
the
hour
was
eleven
he
pictured
a
train
flying
like
a
black
shadow
through
the
white
night
was
she
on
it
safe
professor
bolton
he
said
there
could
possibly
be
any
one
anywhere
more
eager
than
i
to
learn
all
the
details
of
this
affair
to
hear
your
real
reason
for
coming
to
baldpate
inn
and
to
have
the
incident
properly
classified
and
given
its
niche
in
history
but
let
me
tell
you
again
my
action
of
was
no
mere
madness
of
the
moment
i
shall
stick
to
it
through
thick
and
thin
now
about
the
blondes
the
blondes
repeated
the
professor
dreamily
ah
yes
i
must
make
a
small
confession
of
guilt
there
i
did
not
come
here
to
escape
the
results
of
that
indiscreet
remark
but
i
really
made
it
about
a
year
ago
shall
i
ever
forget
hardly
the
newspapers
and
my
wife
wo
let
me
i
can
never
again
win
a
new
honor
however
dignified
without
being
referred
to
in
print
as
the
advocate
the
thing
has
made
me
furious
however
i
did
not
come
to
baldpate
inn
to
avoid
the
results
of
a
lying
newspaper
story
though
many
a
time
a
year
ago
when
i
started
to
leave
my
house
and
saw
the
reporters
camped
on
my
i
longed
for
the
seclusion
of
some
such
spot
as
this
on
the
night
when
kendrick
and
i
climbed
baldpate
mountain
i
remarked
as
much
to
him
and
so
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
found
any
need
of
explaining
my
presence
here
the
blond
incident
would
do
very
well
it
was
only
a
white
lie
a
blond
one
corrected
magee
i
forgive
you
professor
and
mighty
glad
the
incident
really
happened
despite
the
pain
it
caused
you
for
it
in
a
way
condones
my
own
offense
and
it
makes
you
human
too
if
to
err
is
human
it
does
agreed
professor
bolton
to
begin
with
i
am
a
member
of
the
faculty
of
the
university
of
reuton
situated
as
you
no
doubt
know
in
the
city
of
the
same
name
for
a
long
time
i
have
taken
a
quiet
interest
in
our
municipal
politics
i
have
been
up
in
arms
linguistic
arms
against
this
odd
character
cargan
who
came
from
the
slums
to
rule
us
with
a
rod
of
iron
every
one
knows
he
is
corrupt
that
he
is
wealthy
through
the
sale
of
privilege
that
there
is
actually
a
fixed
schedule
of
prices
for
favors
in
the
way
of
city
ordinances
i
have
often
denounced
him
to
my
friends
since
i
have
met
him
well
it
is
remarkable
is
it
not
the
effect
of
personality
on
one
opinions
i
expected
to
face
a
devil
with
the
usual
appurtenances
instead
i
have
found
a
human
rather
likable
man
i
can
well
understand
now
why
it
is
that
the
mob
follows
him
like
sheep
however
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
he
is
a
crook
and
must
be
punished
even
though
i
do
like
him
immensely
magee
smiled
over
to
where
the
great
bulk
of
cargan
slouched
in
a
chair
he
a
bully
old
scout
he
remarked
even
so
replied
the
professor
his
career
of
graft
in
reuton
must
come
to
a
speedy
close
he
is
of
a
type
fast
vanishing
through
the
awakening
public
conscience
and
his
career
will
end
i
assure
you
despite
the
fact
that
you
magee
have
seen
fit
to
send
our
evidence
scurrying
through
the
night
at
the
behest
of
a
chit
of
a
girl
i
beg
your
pardon
i
shall
continue
young
drayton
the
new
county
prosecutor
was
several
years
back
a
favorite
pupil
of
mine
after
he
left
law
school
he
fell
under
the
spell
of
the
picturesque
mayor
of
reuton
cargan
liked
him
and
he
rose
rapidly
drayton
had
no
thought
of
ever
turning
against
his
benefactor
when
he
accepted
the
first
favors
but
later
the
open
selling
of
men
souls
began
to
disgust
him
when
cargan
offered
him
the
place
of
prosecutor
a
few
months
ago
drayton
assured
him
that
he
would
keep
his
oath
of
office
the
mayor
laughed
drayton
insisted
cargan
had
not
yet
met
the
man
he
could
not
handle
he
gave
drayton
the
place
the
old
man
leaned
forward
and
tapped
magee
on
the
knee
it
was
in
me
remember
he
went
on
that
drayton
confided
his
resolve
to
serve
the
public
i
was
delighted
at
the
news
a
few
weeks
ago
he
informed
me
his
first
opportunity
was
at
hand
through
one
of
the
men
in
his
office
he
had
learned
that
hayden
of
the
suburban
electric
was
seeking
to
consolidate
that
road
which
had
fallen
into
partial
disrepute
under
his
management
during
the
illness
of
thornhill
the
president
with
the
civic
the
consolidation
would
raise
the
value
of
the
suburban
nearly
two
million
dollars
at
the
public
expense
hayden
had
seen
cargan
cargan
had
drafted
ordinance
number
and
informed
hayden
that
his
price
for
passing
it
through
the
council
would
be
the
sum
you
have
juggled
in
your
possession
on
baldpate
mountain
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
a
mere
trifle
remarked
magee
sarcastically
so
cargan
made
hayden
see
through
long
experience
in
these
matters
the
mayor
has
become
careless
he
is
the
thing
above
the
law
if
not
the
law
itself
he
would
have
had
no
fear
in
accepting
this
money
on
main
street
at
midday
he
had
no
fear
when
he
came
here
and
found
he
was
being
spied
on
but
hayden
there
was
the
difficulty
that
began
the
drama
of
baldpate
inn
hayden
had
few
scruples
but
as
events
have
well
proved
magee
he
was
a
coward
at
heart
i
do
not
know
just
why
he
lies
on
your
bed
at
this
moment
a
suicide
that
is
a
matter
between
kendrick
and
him
and
one
which
kendrick
himself
has
not
yet
fathomed
as
i
say
hayden
was
afraid
of
being
caught
andy
rutter
manager
of
baldpate
inn
for
the
last
few
summers
is
in
some
way
mixed
up
in
the
suburban
it
was
he
who
suggested
to
hayden
that
an
absolutely
secluded
spot
for
passing
this
large
sum
of
money
would
be
the
inn
the
idea
appealed
to
hayden
cargan
tried
to
laugh
him
out
of
it
the
mayor
did
not
relish
the
thought
of
a
visit
to
baldpate
mountain
in
the
dead
of
winter
particularly
as
he
considered
such
precautions
unnecessary
but
hayden
was
firm
this
spot
he
pointed
out
was
ideal
and
the
mayor
at
last
laughingly
gave
in
the
sum
involved
was
well
worth
taking
a
little
trouble
to
gain
professor
bolton
paused
and
blinked
his
dim
old
eyes
so
the
matter
was
arranged
he
continued
mr
bland
a
clerk
in
hayden
employ
was
sent
up
here
with
the
money
which
he
placed
in
the
safe
on
the
very
night
of
our
arrival
the
safe
had
been
left
open
by
rutter
bland
did
not
have
the
combination
he
put
the
package
inside
swung
shut
the
door
and
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
mayor
i
was
present
smiled
magee
at
the
ceremony
you
mention
yes
all
these
plans
as
i
have
said
were
known
to
drayton
a
few
nights
ago
he
came
to
me
he
wanted
to
send
an
emissary
to
baldpate
a
man
whom
cargan
had
never
met
one
who
could
perhaps
keep
up
the
pretense
of
being
here
for
some
other
reason
than
a
connection
with
the
bribe
he
asked
me
to
undertake
the
mission
to
see
all
i
could
and
if
possible
to
secure
the
package
of
money
this
last
seemed
hardly
likely
at
any
rate
i
was
to
gather
all
the
evidence
i
could
i
hesitated
my
library
fire
never
looked
so
alluring
as
on
that
night
also
i
was
engaged
in
some
very
entertaining
researches
i
beg
your
pardon
said
billy
magee
some
very
entertaining
research
work
yes
reflected
magee
slowly
i
suppose
such
things
do
exist
go
on
please
i
had
loudly
proclaimed
my
championship
of
civic
virtue
however
and
here
was
a
chance
to
serve
reuton
i
acquiesced
the
day
i
was
to
start
up
here
poor
kendrick
came
back
he
too
had
been
a
student
of
mine
a
friend
of
both
drayton
and
hayden
seven
years
ago
he
and
hayden
were
running
the
suburban
together
under
thornhill
direction
the
two
young
men
became
mixed
up
in
a
rather
shady
business
deal
which
was
more
of
hayden
weaving
than
kendrick
hayden
came
to
kendrick
with
the
story
that
they
were
about
to
be
found
out
and
suggested
that
one
assume
the
blame
and
go
away
i
am
telling
you
all
this
in
confidence
as
a
friend
of
my
friends
the
bentleys
and
a
young
man
whom
i
like
and
trust
despite
your
momentary
madness
in
the
matter
of
yellow
locks
we
are
all
susceptible
kendrick
went
for
seven
years
he
stayed
away
in
an
impossible
tropic
town
believing
himself
sought
by
the
law
for
so
hayden
wrote
him
not
long
ago
he
discovered
that
the
matter
in
which
he
and
hayden
had
offended
had
never
been
disclosed
after
all
he
hurried
back
to
the
states
you
can
imagine
his
bitterness
he
had
been
engaged
to
myra
thornhill
and
the
fact
that
hayden
was
also
in
love
with
her
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
his
treachery
to
his
friend
magee
eyes
strayed
to
where
the
two
victims
of
the
dead
falsehood
whispered
together
in
the
shadows
and
he
wondered
at
the
calmness
with
which
kendrick
had
greeted
hayden
in
the
room
above
when
kendrick
arrived
professor
bolton
went
on
first
of
all
he
consulted
his
old
friend
drayton
drayton
informed
him
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
should
his
misstep
be
made
public
for
in
reality
there
was
at
this
late
day
no
crime
committed
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
he
also
told
kendrick
how
matters
stood
and
of
the
net
he
was
spreading
for
hayden
he
had
some
fears
he
said
about
sending
a
man
of
my
years
alone
to
baldpate
inn
kendrick
begged
for
the
chance
to
come
too
so
without
making
his
return
known
in
reuton
three
nights
ago
he
accompanied
me
here
three
nights
it
seems
years
i
had
secured
keys
for
us
both
from
john
bentley
as
we
climbed
the
mountain
i
noticed
your
light
and
we
agreed
it
would
be
best
if
only
one
of
us
revealed
ourselves
to
the
intruders
in
the
inn
so
kendrick
let
himself
in
by
a
side
door
while
i
engaged
you
and
bland
in
the
office
he
spent
the
night
on
the
third
floor
in
the
morning
i
told
the
whole
affair
to
quimby
knowing
his
interest
in
both
hayden
and
kendrick
and
secured
for
kendrick
the
key
to
the
annex
almost
as
soon
as
i
arrived
the
curtain
went
up
on
the
melodrama
suggested
magee
you
state
it
vividly
and
with
truth
professor
bolton
replied
night
before
last
the
ordinance
numbered
was
due
to
pass
the
council
it
was
arranged
that
when
it
did
hayden
through
his
man
rutter
or
personally
would
telephone
the
combination
of
the
safe
to
the
mayor
of
reuton
cargan
and
bland
sat
in
the
office
watching
for
the
flash
of
light
at
the
telephone
switchboard
while
you
and
i
were
max
prisoners
above
something
went
wrong
hayden
heard
that
the
courts
would
issue
an
injunction
making
ordinance
number
worthless
so
although
the
council
obeyed
cargan
instructions
and
passed
the
bill
hayden
refused
to
give
the
mayor
the
combination
the
old
man
paused
and
shook
his
head
wonderingly
then
melodrama
began
in
dead
earnest
he
continued
i
have
always
been
a
man
of
peace
and
the
wild
scuffle
that
claimed
me
for
one
of
its
leading
actors
from
that
moment
will
remain
in
my
memory
as
long
as
i
live
cargan
dynamited
the
safe
kendrick
held
him
up
you
held
up
kendrick
i
peeked
through
your
window
and
saw
you
place
the
package
of
money
under
a
brick
in
your
fireplace
you
the
curtains
were
down
interrupted
magee
i
found
a
of
open
space
explained
the
old
man
yes
i
actually
lay
on
my
stomach
in
the
snow
and
watched
you
in
the
morning
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
committed
robbery
my
punishment
was
swift
and
sure
bland
swooped
down
upon
me
again
this
afternoon
i
came
upon
the
precious
package
after
a
long
search
in
the
hands
of
the
hermit
of
baldpate
i
thought
we
were
safe
at
last
when
i
handed
the
package
to
kendrick
in
my
room
but
i
had
not
counted
on
the
wild
things
a
youth
like
you
will
do
for
love
of
a
designing
maid
twelve
the
civic
center
of
upper
asquewan
falls
proclaimed
it
magee
had
never
been
in
reuton
he
was
sorry
he
had
he
had
to
construct
from
imagination
alone
the
great
reuton
station
through
which
the
girl
and
the
money
must
now
be
hurrying
where
the
question
would
not
down
was
she
as
the
professor
believed
designing
no
said
magee
answering
aloud
his
own
question
you
are
wrong
sir
i
do
not
know
just
what
the
motives
of
miss
norton
were
in
desiring
this
money
but
i
will
stake
my
reputation
as
an
honest
man
that
they
were
perfectly
all
right
perhaps
replied
the
other
quite
unconvinced
but
what
honest
motive
could
she
have
i
am
able
to
assign
her
no
rôle
in
this
little
drama
i
have
tried
i
am
able
to
see
no
connection
between
her
and
the
other
characters
what
pardon
me
broke
in
magee
but
would
you
mind
telling
me
why
miss
thornhill
came
up
to
baldpate
to
join
in
the
chase
for
the
package
her
motive
replied
the
professor
does
her
great
credit
for
several
years
her
father
henry
thornhill
has
been
forced
through
illness
to
leave
the
management
of
the
railway
affairs
to
his
hayden
late
yesterday
the
old
man
heard
of
this
proposed
bribe
on
his
sick
bed
he
was
very
nearly
insane
at
the
thought
of
the
disgrace
it
would
bring
upon
him
he
tried
to
rise
himself
and
prevent
the
passing
of
the
package
his
daughter
a
brave
loyal
girl
herself
undertook
the
task
then
said
magee
miss
thornhill
is
not
distressed
at
the
loss
of
the
most
important
evidence
in
the
case
i
have
explained
the
matter
to
her
returned
professor
bolton
there
is
no
chance
whatever
that
her
father
name
will
be
implicated
both
drayton
and
myself
have
the
highest
regard
for
his
integrity
the
whole
affair
was
arranged
when
he
was
too
ill
to
dream
of
it
his
good
name
will
be
smirched
in
no
way
the
only
man
involved
on
the
giver
side
is
dead
in
the
room
above
the
man
we
are
after
now
is
cargan
miss
thornhill
has
agreed
that
it
is
best
to
prosecute
that
eliminates
her
did
miss
thornhill
and
kendrick
meet
for
the
first
time
after
his
exile
in
number
seven
magee
wanted
to
know
yes
answered
professor
bolton
in
one
of
his
letters
long
ago
hayden
told
kendrick
he
was
engaged
to
the
girl
it
was
the
last
letter
kendrick
received
from
him
there
was
a
pause
the
important
point
now
the
old
man
went
on
is
the
identity
of
this
girl
to
whom
you
have
made
your
princely
gift
out
of
the
goodness
of
your
young
heart
i
propose
to
speak
to
the
woman
she
has
introduced
as
her
mother
and
elicit
what
information
i
can
he
crossed
the
floor
followed
by
magee
and
stood
by
the
chair
she
looked
up
her
eyes
heavy
with
sleep
her
appearance
more
tawdry
than
ever
in
that
faint
light
madam
remarked
the
professor
with
the
air
of
a
judge
trying
a
case
your
daughter
has
made
her
escape
from
this
place
with
a
large
sum
of
money
earnestly
desired
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
reuton
county
in
the
name
of
the
law
i
command
you
to
tell
me
her
destination
and
what
she
proposes
to
do
with
that
package
of
greenbacks
the
woman
blinked
stupidly
in
the
dusk
she
ai
my
daughter
she
replied
and
magee
heart
leaped
up
i
can
tell
you
that
much
i
keep
a
in
reuton
and
miss
the
girl
you
speak
about
has
been
my
boarder
for
three
years
she
brought
me
up
here
as
a
sort
of
chaperon
though
i
do
see
as
i
old
enough
for
that
yet
you
do
get
nothing
else
out
of
me
except
that
she
is
a
perfectly
lovely
young
woman
and
your
money
could
be
safer
with
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
puzzled
professor
of
comparative
literature
caressed
his
bald
head
thoughtfully
i
er
he
remarked
magee
could
have
embraced
this
faded
woman
for
her
news
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
the
siege
is
over
he
cried
i
shall
not
attempt
to
direct
your
actions
any
longer
peters
will
you
please
go
down
to
the
village
and
bring
back
quimby
and
the
coroner
the
coroner
the
mayor
of
reuton
jumped
to
his
feet
i
do
want
to
be
in
on
any
inquest
scene
come
on
max
let
get
out
of
here
bland
stood
up
his
face
was
white
and
worried
his
gay
plumage
no
longer
set
the
tone
for
his
mood
i
think
i
go
too
he
announced
looking
hopefully
at
magee
i
no
longer
your
jailer
magee
said
professor
these
gentlemen
are
your
witnesses
do
you
wish
to
detain
them

cried
the
mayor
angrily
there
ai
no
question
but
that
you
can
find
me
in
reuton
any
time
you
want
me
at
the
little
room
on
main
street
anybody
can
tell
you
my
hours
the
door
always
open
to
any
reformer
that
has
the
nerve
to
climb
the
stairs
look
me
up
there
i
make
it
interesting
for
you
i
certainly
shall
the
professor
replied
and
very
soon
until
then
you
may
go
when
and
where
you
please
thanks
sneered
the
mayor
i
expect
you
i
be
ready
i
had
to
get
ready
to
answer
your
kind
before
you
think
you
got
me
eh
well

fool

think
that
as
for
drayton

pup

drayton
when
i
get
back
to
reuton
before

remarked
magee
smiling
i
want
to
ask
about
arabella
where
did
you
get
her
some
of
it
happened
to
a
friend
of
mine
the
answered
a
friend
that
keeps
a
clothing
store
i
got
this
suit
there
i
changed
the
story
here
and
there
he
did
write
her
no
note
though
he
thought
seriously
of
it
and
he
did
run
away
and
hide
the
last
i
seen
of
him
he
was
testing
the
effect
of
the
on
sale
behind
the
swinging
doors
magee
laughed
but
over
the
long
lean
face
of
bland
not
the
ghost
of
a
smile
flitted
he
was
frightened
through
and
through
you
a
fine
bunch
sneered
max
reformers
eh
well
you
get
what
the
rest
of
always
got
we
tie
you
up
in
knots
and
leave
you

the
of
some
orphan
asylum
before
we
through
with
you
come
on
lou
said
cargan
drayton
a
smart
guy
doc
where
his
proof
eloped
with
the
bundle
of
dry
goods
this
young
man
taken
a
fancy
to
and
even
if
he
had
the
money
i
been
up
against

you
wasting
your

doc
good
night
come
on
boys
the
three
stamped
out
through
the

from

watched

disappear
down
the
road
that
stretched
to
asquewan
falls
chapter
xviii
a
red
card
magee
turned
back
from
the
window
to
the
dim
interior
of
the
hotel
office
he
who
had
come
to
baldpate
inn
to
court
loneliness
had
never
felt
so
lonely
in
his
life
for
he
had
lost
sight
of
her
in
the
great
reuton
station
of
his
imagination
she
had
slipped
from
his
dreams
to
go
where
he
could
not
follow
even
in
thought
he
felt
as
he
knew
this
great
bare
room
must
feel
each
fall
when
the
last
laugh
died
away
down
the
mountain
and
the
gloom
of
winter
descended
from
drab
skies
selecting
a
log
of
the
hermit
cutting
from
the
stock
beside
the
hearth
magee
tossed
it
on
the
fire
there
followed
a
shower
of
sparks
and
a
flood
of
red
light
in
the
room
through
this
light
kendrick
advanced
to
magee
side
and
the
first
of
the
baldpate
hermits
saw
that
the
man
face
was
lined
by
care
that
his
eyes
were
tired
even
under
the
new
light
in
them
that
his
mouth
was
twisted
bitterly
poor
devil
thought
magee
kendrick
drew
up
chairs
for
himself
and
magee
and
they
sat
down
behind
them
the
bulky
norton
dozed
dreaming
perhaps
of
her
reuton
while
miss
thornhill
and
the
professor
talked
intermittently
in
low
tones
the
ranks
at
baldpate
were
thinning
rapidly
before
long
the
place
must
settle
back
with
a
sigh
in
the
cold
to
wait
for
its
first
summer
girl
magee
said
kendrick
nervously
you
have
become
involved
in
an
unkind
a
tragic
story
i
do
not
mean
the
affair
of
the
bribe
i
refer
to
the
matter
between
hayden
and
myself
before
peters
comes
back
with
the
men
he
went
for
i
should
like
to
tell
you
some
of
the
facts
of
that
story
if
you
had
rather
not
began
magee
no
replied
kendrick
i
prefer
that
you
should
know
it
was
you
who
took
the
pistol
from
his
hand
i
do
not
believe
that
even
i
can
tell
you
all
that
was
in
hayden
mind
when
he
went
into
that
other
room
and
closed
the
door
it
seems
to
me
preposterous
that
a
man
of
his
sort
should
take
his
life
under
the
circumstances
i
feel
somehow
that
there
is
a
part
of
the
story
even
i
do
not
know
but
let
that
be
he
bowed
his
head
in
his
hands
ever
since
i
came
into
this
room
he
went
on
the
eyes
of
a
pompous
little
man
have
been
following
me
about
they
have
constantly
recalled
to
me
the
nightmare
of
my
life
you
have
noticed
no
doubt
the
pictures
of
the
admiral
that
decorate
these
walls
i
have
replied
magee
he
gazed
curiously
at
the
nearest
of
the
portraits
how
persistently
this
almost
mythical
starched
man
wove
in
and
out
of
the
melodrama
at
baldpate
inn
well
continued
kendrick
the
admiral
eyes
haunt
me
perhaps
you
know
that
he
plays
a
game
a
game
of
solitaire
i
have
good
reason
to
remember
that
game
it
is
a
silly
inconsequential
game
you
would
scarcely
believe
that
it
once
sent
a
man
to
hell
he
stopped
i
am
beginning
in
the
middle
of
my
story
he
apologized
let
me
go
back
six
years
ago
i
was
hardly
the
man
you
see
now
i
was
at
least
twenty
years
younger
hayden
and
i
worked
together
in
the
office
of
the
suburban
railway
we
had
been
close
friends
at
college
i
believed
in
him
and
trusted
him
although
i
knew
he
had
certain
weaknesses
i
was
a
happy
man
i
had
risen
rapidly
i
was
young
the
future
was
lying
golden
before
me
and
i
was
engaged
the
daughter
of
henry
thornhill
our
employer
the
girl
you
have
met
here
at
baldpate
had
promised
to
be
my
wife
hayden
had
also
been
a
suitor
but
when
our
engagement
was
announced
he
came
to
me
like
a
man
and
i
thought
his
words
were
sincere
one
day
hayden
told
me
of
a
chance
we
might
take
which
would
make
us
rich
it
was
not
altogether
within
the
law
but
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
other
men
were
doing
constantly
and
hayden
assured
me
that
as
he
had
arranged
matters
it
was
absolutely
safe
my
great
sin
is
that
i
agreed
we
should
take
the
chance
a
sin
for
which
i
have
paid
magee
over
and
over
again
he
paused
and
gazed
steadily
at
the
fire
again
magee
noted
the
gray
at
his
temples
the
aftermath
of
fevers
in
his
cheeks
we
took
the
chance
he
went
on
for
a
time
everything
went
well
then
one
blustering
march
night
hayden
came
to
me
and
told
me
we
were
certain
to
be
caught
some
of
his
plans
had
gone
awry
i
trusted
him
fully
at
the
time
you
understand
he
was
the
man
with
whom
i
had
sat
on
the
of
my
room
at
college
settling
the
question
of
immortality
and
all
the
other
great
questions
young
men
settle
at
such
times
i
have
at
this
moment
no
doubt
that
he
was
quite
truthful
when
he
said
we
were
in
danger
of
arrest
we
arranged
to
meet
the
next
night
at
the
argots
club
and
decide
on
what
we
should
do
we
met
in
the
library
of
the
club
hayden
came
in
to
me
from
the
adjoining
where
he
had
been
watching
the
admiral
doddering
over
his
eternal
game
the
old
man
had
become
a
fixture
at
the
club
like
parker
down
at
the
door
or
the
great
chandelier
in
the
hall
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
when
he
tried
to
talk
to
the
younger
men
about
his
game
they
fled
as
from
a
pestilence
well
as
i
say
hayden
came
to
meet
me
and
just
at
that
moment
the
admiral
finished
his
game
and
went
out
we
were
alone
in
the
library
hayden
told
me
he
had
thought
the
matter
over
carefully
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
clear
out
of
reuton
forever
but
why
he
argued
should
we
both
go
why
wreck
two
lives
it
would
be
far
better
he
told
me
for
one
to
assume
the
guilt
of
both
and
go
away
i
can
see
him
now
how
funny
and
white
his
face
looked
in
that
room
how
his
hands
trembled
i
was
far
the
calmer
of
the
two
i
agreed
to
his
plan
hayden
led
the
way
into
the
room
where
the
admiral
had
been
playing
we
went
up
to
the
table
over
which
the
light
still
burned
on
it
lay
two
decks
of
cards
face
up
hayden
picked
up
the
nearest
deck
and
shuffled
it
nervously
his
face
god
it
was
like
the
snow
out
there
on
the
mountain
kendrick
closed
his
eyes
and
magee
gazed
at
him
in
silent
pity
he
held
out
the
deck
went
on
the
exile
softly
he
told
me
to
draw
he
said
if
the
card
was
black
he
clear
out
if
it
red
david
he
said
you
got
to
go
i
held
my
breath
and
drew
it
was
a
full
minute
before
i
dared
look
at
the
card
in
my
hand
then
i
turned
it
over
and
it
was
red
a
measly
little
red
i
do
suppose
a
man
ever
realizes
all
at
once
what
such
a
moment
means
i
remember
that
i
was
much
cooler
than
hayden
it
was
i
who
had
to
brace
him
up
i
i
even
tried
to
joke
with
him
but
his
face
was
like
death
he
hardly
spoke
at
all
at
first
and
then
suddenly
he
became
horribly
talkative
i
left
him
talking
wildly
i
left
reuton
i
left
the
girl
to
whom
i
was
engaged
to
break
the
silence
that
followed
magee
leaned
forward
and
stirred
the
logs
i
do
want
to
bore
you
kendrick
said
trying
to
smile
i
went
to
a
little
town
in
south
america
there
was
no
treaty
of
extradition
there
nor
anything
else
civilized
and
decent
i
smoked
cigarettes
and
drank
what
passed
for
rum
on
the
balcony
of
an
impossible
hotel
and
otherwise
groped
about
for
the
path
that
leads
to
the
devil
after
a
year
i
wrote
to
hayden
he
answered
urging
me
to
stay
away
he
intimated
that
the
thing
we
had
done
was
on
my
shoulders
i
was
ashamed
frightfully
unhappy
i
did
dare
write
to
her
i
had
disgraced
her
i
asked
hayden
about
her
and
he
wrote
back
that
she
was
shortly
to
marry
him
after
that
i
did
want
to
come
back
to
reuton
i
wanted
most
to
die
the
years
crept
by
on
the
balcony
of
that
impossible
hotel
six
of
them
the
first
in
bitter
memories
memories
of
a
red
card
that
danced
fiendishly
before
my
eyes
when
i
closed
them
the
last
in
a
fierce
biting
desire
to
come
back
to
the
world
i
had
left
at
last
a
few
months
ago
i
wrote
to
another
college
friend
of
mine
drayton
and
told
him
the
whole
story
i
did
not
know
that
he
had
been
elected
prosecutor
in
reuton
he
answered
with
a
kind
pitying
letter
and
finally
i
knew
the
horrible
truth
nothing
had
ever
happened
the
thing
we
had
done
had
never
been
discovered
hayden
had
lied
he
had
even
lied
about
his
engagement
to
myra
thornhill
there
he
had
made
a
reality
out
of
what
was
simply
his
great
desire
you
can
imagine
my
feelings
six
years
in
a
tomb
a
comic
opera
sort
of
tomb
where
a
silly
surf
was
forever
pounding
and
foolish
palms
kept
waving
six
years
for
nothing
six
years
while
hayden
guiltier
than
i
stayed
behind
to
enjoy
the
good
things
of
life
to
plead
for
the
girl
whose
lover
he
had
banished
i
lost
no
time
in
coming
north
three
days
ago
i
entered
office
i
was
ready
and
willing
that
the
wrong
hayden
and
i
had
done
should
be
made
public
drayton
informed
me
that
legally
there
had
been
no
crime
that
hayden
had
straightened
things
out
in
time
that
we
had
defrauded
no
one
and
he
told
me
that
for
whatever
sin
i
had
committed
he
thought
i
had
more
than
atoned
down
there
in
that
town
that
god
forgot
i
think
i
had
he
explained
to
me
about
the
trap
he
had
laid
for
hayden
up
here
at
baldpate
inn
i
begged
to
help
what
happened
after
you
know
as
well
as
i
yes
i
think
i
do
agreed
magee
softly
i
have
told
you
the
whole
story
kendrick
replied
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
still
it
is
not
all
told
why
should
hayden
have
killed
himself
he
had
lied
to
me
it
is
true
but
life
was
always
sweet
to
him
and
it
hardly
seems
to
me
that
he
was
the
sort
to
die
simply
because
his
falsehood
was
discovered
was
there
some
other
act
of
cruelty
some
side
to
the
story
of
which
we
are
none
of
us
aware
i
wonder
he
was
silent
a
moment
anyhow
i
have
told
you
all
i
know
he
said
shall
i
tell
it
also
to
the
coroner
or
shall
we
allow
hayden
suicide
to
pass
as
the
result
of
his
implication
in
this
attempt
at
bribery
i
ask
your
advice
mr
magee
my
advice
returned
magee
is
that
you
befuddle
no
pompous
little
village
doctor
with
the
complication
of
this
unhappy
tale
no
let
the
story
be
that
hayden
killed
himself
as
the
toils
closed
in
on
him
the
toils
of
the
law
that
punishes
the
bribe
giver
now
and
then
and
occasionally
kendrick
you
have
my
deepest
sympathy
is
it
too
much
for
me
to
hope
he
glanced
across
the
room
to
where
myra
thornhill
sat
beside
the
professor
that
the
best
of
your
life
is
yet
to
come
that
out
of
the
wreck
this
man
made
of
it
you
may
yet
be
happy
kendrick
smiled
you
are
very
kind
he
said
twice
we
have
met
and
battled
in
the
snow
and
i
do
not
hold
it
against
you
that
both
times
you
were
the
victor
life
in
a
tropic
town
magee
is
not
exactly
a
experience
once
i
might
have
given
the
whole
proceeding
a
different
turn
yes
miss
thornhill
has
waited
for
me
all
these
years
waited
believing
it
is
a
loyalty
of
which
i
can
not
speak
without
you
understand
she
knows
why
i
went
away
why
i
stayed
away
she
is
still
ready
to
marry
me
i
shall
go
again
into
the
suburban
office
and
try
to
lift
the
road
from
the
muck
into
which
it
has
fallen
yes
it
is
not
too
much
for
me
to
hope
and
for
you
in
your
kindness
that
a
great
happiness
is
still
for
me
believe
me
i
glad
replied
magee
with
youthful
enthusiasm
holding
out
his
hand
i
sorry
i
spoiled
your
little
game
up
here
but
i
understand
smiled
kendrick
i
think
none
the
less
of
you
for
what
you
have
done
and
who
knows
it
may
turn
out
to
have
been
the
wisest
course
after
all
ah
would
it
magee
walked
to
the
window
pondering
on
the
odd
tangle
of
events
that
had
not
yet
been
completely
straightened
out
certainly
her
eyes
were
an
honest
blue
as
well
as
a
beautiful
but
who
was
she
where
was
she
the
great
figure
of
norton
stirred
restlessly
near
at
hand
the
puffed
lids
of
her
eyes
opened
magee
she
said
when
she
had
made
out
his
figure
by
the
window
you
been
a
true
friend
as
i
might
say
to
a
couple
of
mad
females
who
ought
to
have
been
at
home
by
their
own
firesides
and
i
going
to
ask
one
more
favor
of
you
find
out
when
the
next
train
goes
to
reuton
and
see
that
i
at
the
station
an
hour
or
two
before
it
pulls
out
i
do
that
norton
smiled
magee
by
the
way
is
norton
the
name
yes
answered
the
woman
that
my
name
of
course
it
ai
hers
i
ca
tell
that
no
matter
said
magee
she
probably
change
it
soon
ca
you
tell
me
something
about
her
just
a
tiny
bit
of
information
just
a
picture
of
where
she
is
now
and
what
she
doing
with
that
small
fortune
i
gave
her
where
is
she
now
repeated
norton
she
home
and
in
bed
in
my
second
floor
front
unless
she
gone
clear
crazy
and
that
where
i
wish
i
was
this
minute
in
bed
though
it
a
question
in
my
mind
if
i
ever
be
able
to
sleep
again
what
with
the
uproar
and
confusion
my
house
is
probably
in
by
this
time
leaving
it
in
charge
of
a
girl
norton
always
used
to
say
if
you
want
a
thing
done
right
do
it
yourself
and
though
he
did
always
live
up
to
the
sentiment
letting
me
do
most
things
he
wanted
done
right
there
was
a
lot
of
truth
in
his
words
i
certainly
must
get
back
to
reuton
just
as
quick
as
the
railroad
will
take
me
why
did
you
come
prodded
magee
why
did
you
leave
your
house
on
this
strange
mission
the
lord
knows
replied
the
woman
i
certainly
never
intended
to
but
she
begged
and
pleaded
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
was
on
a
train
she
has
winning
ways
that
girl
maybe
you
noticed
i
have
assented
billy
magee
i
thought
so
no
magee
i
ca
tell
you
nothing
about
her
i
ai
allowed
to
even
you
that
has
been
so
kind
she
made
me
promise
know
soon
enough
she
kept
saying
but
i
will
tell
you
as
i
told
you
before
there
no
occasion
to
worry
about
her
unless
you
was
to
think
was
she
held
up
and
murdered
with
all
that
money
on
her
the
brave
little
dear
if
you
was
considering
offering
yourself
for
the
job
of
changing
her
name
magee
i
say
go
in
and
do
it
it
sure
is
time
she
settled
down
and
gave
up
this
this
gave
it
all
up
before
something
awful
happens
to
her
you
wo
forget
the
very
next
train
mr
magee
the
very
next
magee
agreed
in
through
the
door
stamped
quimby
grave
of
face
dazed
at
being
roused
from
sleep
and
with
him
an
important
little
man
whose
duty
it
was
to
investigate
at
upper
asquewan
falls
such
things
as
had
happened
that
night
at
baldpate
even
from
his
slumber
he
rose
with
the
air
of
a
judge
and
the
manner
of
a
sherlock
holmes
for
an
hour
he
asked
questions
and
in
the
end
he
prepared
to
go
in
a
seemingly
satisfied
state
of
mind
quimby
face
was
very
awed
when
he
came
after
a
visit
to
the
room
above
poor
fellow
he
said
to
magee
i
sorry
he
was
so
young
for
such
as
quimby
carry
no
feud
beyond
the
gates
he
went
over
and
took
kendrick
hand
i
never
had
a
chance
he
said
to
thank
you
for
all
you
tried
to
do
for
me
and
my
invention
and
it
came
to
nothing
in
the
end
kendrick
asked
nothing
quimby
answered
i
i
had
to
creep
back
to
baldpate
mountain
finally
broke
and
discouraged
i
have
been
here
ever
since
all
my
blue
prints
all
my
models
they
locked
away
forever
in
a
chest
up
in
the
attic
not
forever
quimby
kendrick
replied
i
always
did
believe
in
your
invention
i
believe
in
it
still
when
i
get
back
into
the
harness
sure
i
can
do
something
for
you
quimby
shook
his
head
he
looked
to
be
half
asleep
it
do
seem
possible
he
said
no
it
all
been
buried
so
long
all
the
hope
all
the
plans
it
do
seem
possible
it
could
ever
come
to
life
again
but
it
can
and
it
will
cried
kendrick
i
going
to
lay
a
stretch
of
track
in
reuton
with
your
joints
that
all
you
need
they
have
to
use
then
we
force
the
civic
into
it
we
can
do
it
quimby
we
surely
can
quimby
rubbed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
you
lay
a
stretch
of
track
he
repeated
that
great
news
to
me
kendrick
i
i
ca
thank
you
now
his
voice
was
husky
i
come
back
and
take
care
of
him
he
said
jerking
his
head
toward
the
room
i
got
to
go
now
this
minute
i
got
to
go
and
tell
my
wife
i
got
to
tell
her
what
you
said
chapter
xix
exeunt
omnes
as
shakespeare
has
it
at
four
in
the
morning
baldpate
inn
wrapped
in
the
arms
of
winter
had
all
the
rare
gaiety
and
charm
of
a
baseball
bleechers
on
christmas
eve
looking
gloomily
out
the
window
magee
heard
behind
him
the
steps
on
the
stairs
and
the
low
cautions
of
quimby
and
two
men
he
had
brought
from
the
village
who
were
carrying
something
down
to
the
dark
carriage
that
waited
outside
he
did
not
look
round
it
was
a
picture
he
wished
to
avoid
so
this
was
the
end
the
end
of
his
two
and
a
half
days
of
solitude
the
end
of
his
exile
on
baldpate
mountain
he
thought
of
bland
lean
and
white
of
face
gay
of
garb
fleeing
through
the
night
his
arabella
fiction
disowned
in
the
real
tragedy
that
had
followed
he
thought
of
cargan
and
max
also
fleeing
wrathful
sneering
by
side
he
thought
of
hayden
jolting
down
the
mountain
in
that
black
wagon
so
it
ended
so
it
ended
most
preposterous
end
with
william
hallowell
magee
madly
desperately
in
love
by
the
gods
in
love
in
love
with
a
fair
girl
for
whom
he
had
fought
and
stolen
and
snapped
his
fingers
at
the
law
as
it
blinked
at
him
in
the
person
of
professor
bolton
billy
magee
the
calm
the
unsusceptible
who
wrote
of
a
popular
cupid
but
had
always
steered
clear
of
his
shots
in
love
with
a
girl
whose
name
he
did
not
know
whose
motives
were
mostly
in
the
fog
and
he
had
come
up
here
to
be
alone
for
the
first
time
in
many
hours
he
thought
of
new
york
of
the
fellows
at
the
club
of
what
they
would
say
when
the
jocund
news
came
that
billy
magee
had
gone
mad
on
a
mountainside
he
thought
of
helen
faulkner
haughty
unperturbed
bred
to
hold
herself
above
the
swift
catastrophies
of
the
world
he
could
see
the
arch
of
her
patrician
eyebrows
the
shrug
of
her
exquisite
shoulders
when
young
williams
hastened
up
the
avenue
and
poured
into
her
ear
the
merry
story
well
so
be
it
he
had
never
cared
for
her
in
her
superiority
he
had
found
a
challenge
in
her
icy
indifference
a
trap
that
lured
him
on
to
try
his
hand
at
winning
her
but
he
had
never
for
a
moment
caught
a
glimmering
of
what
it
was
really
to
care
to
care
as
he
cared
now
for
the
girl
who
had
gone
from
him
somewhere
down
the
mountain
quimby
dragged
into
the
room
the
strain
of
a
rather
wild
night
in
upper
asquewan
falls
in
his
eyes
jake
peters
asked
me
to
tell
you
he
ai
coming
back
he
said
quimby
is
getting
breakfast
for
you
down
at
our
house
you
better
pack
up
now
and
start
down
i
reckon
your
train
goes
at
half
past
six
norton
jumped
up
proclaiming
that
she
must
be
aboard
that
train
at
any
cost
miss
thornhill
the
professor
and
kendrick
ascended
the
stairs
and
in
a
moment
magee
followed
he
stepped
softly
into
number
seven
for
the
tragedy
of
the
rooms
was
still
in
the
air
vague
shapes
seemed
to
flit
about
him
as
he
lighted
a
candle
they
whispered
in
his
ear
that
this
was
to
have
been
the
scene
of
achievement
that
here
he
was
to
have
written
the
book
that
should
make
his
place
secure
ah
well
fate
had
decreed
it
otherwise
it
had
set
plump
in
his
path
the
melodrama
he
had
come
up
to
baldpate
to
avoid
ironic
fate
she
must
be
laughing
now
in
the
sleeve
of
her
kimono
feeling
about
in
the
shadows
magee
gathered
his
things
together
put
them
in
his
bags
and
with
a
last
look
at
number
seven
closed
the
door
forever
on
its
many
excitements
a
shivering
group
awaited
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
hat
was
on
at
an
angle
even
the
most
imaginative
milliner
could
not
have
approved
the
professor
looked
older
than
ever
even
miss
thornhill
seemed
a
little
less
statuesque
and
handsome
in
the
dusk
quimby
led
the
way
to
the
door
they
passed
through
it
and
magee
locked
it
after
them
with
the
key
hal
bentley
had
blithely
given
him
on
street
new
york
so
baldpate
inn
dropped
back
into
the
silence
to
slumber
and
to
wait
to
wait
for
the
magic
of
muslin
the
lilt
of
waltzes
the
tinkle
of
laughter
the
rhythm
of
the
rockers
of
the
fleet
on
its
verandas
the
formal
tread
of
the
admiral
boots
across
its
polished
floors
the
clink
of
dimes
in
the
pockets
of
its
for
a
few
brief
hours
strange
figures
had
replaced
the
unromantic
quimby
in
its
rooms
they
had
come
to
talk
of
money
and
of
love
to
plot
and
scheme
and
as
they
came
in
the
dark
and
moved
most
swiftly
in
the
dark
so
in
the
dark
they
went
away
and
baldpate
startling
winter
drama
took
reluctantly
its
final
curtain
down
the
snowy
road
the
five
followed
quimby
lead
magee
picturing
in
fancy
one
who
had
fled
along
this
path
but
a
short
time
before
the
others
busy
with
many
thoughts
not
the
least
of
which
was
of
quimby
breakfast
at
the
door
of
the
kitchen
she
met
them
maternal
concerned
eager
to
pamper
and
to
serve
just
as
magee
remembered
her
on
that
night
that
now
seemed
so
long
ago
he
smiled
down
into
her
eyes
and
he
had
an
engaging
smile
even
at
in
the
morning
well
quimby
he
cried
here
is
the
prodigal
straight
from
that
old
husk
of
an
inn
and
believe
me
he
pretty
anxious
to
sit
down
to
some
food
that
woman
starter
of
all
the
trouble
since
the
world
began
had
a
hand
in
come
right
in
all
of
you
chirruped
quimby
ushering
them
into
a
pleasant
odor
of
cookery
take
off
your
things
and
sit
down
breakfast
most
ready
my
land
i
guess
you
must
be
pretty
nigh
starved
to
death
quimby
told
me
who
was
cooking
for
you
and
i
says
to
quimby
i
says
no
account
messing
round
at
a
job
like
that
i
says
pity
the
people
at
the
inn
i
says
peters
may
be
able
to
amuse
them
with
stories
of
how
cleopatra
whiled
away
the
quiet
egyptian
evenings
i
says
he
may
be
able
to
throw
a
little
new
light
on
helen
of
troy
who
would
object
to
having
it
thrown
if
she
was
alive
and
the
lady
i
think
her
but
i
says
it
comes
to
cooking
i
guess
he
stands
about
where
you
do
quimby
you
see
quimby
repertory
consists
of
coffee
and
soup
and
sometimes
hard
to
tell
which
he
means
for
which
so
peters
has
taken
you
in
on
the
secret
of
the
book
he
is
writing
against
your
sex
remarked
billy
magee
not
exactly
that
quimby
answered
brushing
back
a
wisp
of
gray
hair
but
he
discussed
it
in
my
presence
ignoring
me
at
the
time
you
see
he
comes
down
here
and
reads
his
latest
chapters
to
quimby
nights
and
i
caught
quite
a
lot
of
it
on
my
way
between
the
and
the
sink
i
ai
no
judge
of
books
remarked
norton
from
a
comfortable
but
i
bet
that
one
the
limit
you
right
quimby
told
her
i
ai
saying
that
some
of
it
ai
real
pretty
worded
but
that
just
to
hide
the
falsehood
underneath
my
land
the
lies
there
is
in
that
book
you
do
need
to
know
much
about
history
to
know
that
jake
peters
has
made
it
over
to
fit
his
argument
and
that
he
ai
made
it
over
so
well
but
what
the
old
seams
show
here
and
there
and
the
place
where
the
braid
was
is
plain
as
daylight
after
ten
more
minutes
of
bustle
quimby
announced
that
they
could
sit
down
and
they
were
not
slow
to
accept
the
invitation
the
breakfast
she
served
them
moved
magee
to
remark
i
want
to
know
where
i
stand
as
a
judge
of
character
on
the
first
night
i
saw
quimby
without
tasting
a
morsel
of
food
cooked
by
her
i
said
she
was
the
best
cook
in
the
county
the
professor
looked
up
from
his
griddle
cakes
why
limit
it
to
the
county
he
asked
i
should
say
you
were
too
parsimonious
in
your
judgment
quimby
detecting
in
the
old
man
words
a
compliment
flushed
an
even
deeper
red
as
she
bent
above
the
stove
under
the
benign
influence
of
the
food
and
the
woman
cheery
personality
the
spirits
of
the
crowd
rose
baldpate
inn
was
in
the
past
its
doors
locked
its
seven
keys
scattered
through
the
dawn
quimby
as
she
continued
to
press
food
upon
them
spoke
with
interest
of
the
events
that
had
come
to
pass
at
the
inn
it
so
seldom
anything
really
happens
around
here
she
said
i
just
been
hungering
for
news
of
the
strange
up
there
and
i
must
say
quimby
ai
been
none
too
newsy
on
the
subject
i
threatened
to
come
up
and
join
in
the
proceedings
myself
especially
when
i
heard
about
the
cook
providence
had
sent
you
you
would
have
found
us
on
the
porch
with
outstretched
arms
magee
assured
her
it
was
on
kendrick
that
quimby
showered
her
attentions
and
when
the
group
rose
to
seek
the
station
amid
a
consultation
of
watches
that
recalled
the
commuter
who
rises
at
dawn
to
play
tag
with
a
flippant
train
magee
heard
her
say
to
the
railroad
man
in
a
heartfelt
aside
i
do
know
as
i
can
ever
thank
you
enough
kendrick
for
putting
new
hope
into
quimby
you
never
understand
what
it
means
when
given
up
and
your
life
seems
all
done
and
wasted
to
hear
that
a
chance
left
wo
i
replied
kendrick
warmly
quimby
it
will
make
me
a
very
happy
man
to
give
your
husband
his
chance
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
were
in
the
sky
when
the
hermits
of
baldpate
filed
through
the
gate
into
the
road
waving
to
quimby
and
his
wife
who
stood
in
their
dooryard
for
the
farewell
down
through
sleepy
little
asquewan
falls
they
paraded
meeting
here
and
there
a
tired
man
with
a
lunch
basket
in
his
hand
who
stepped
to
one
side
and
frankly
stared
while
the
odd
procession
passed
in
the
station
magee
encountered
an
old
friend
he
of
the
mop
of
hair
the
man
who
had
complained
of
the
slowness
of
the
village
gazed
with
wide
eyes
at
magee
i
figured
he
said
that
you
come
this
way
again
well
i
must
say
you
put
a
little
life
into
this
place
if
i
known
when
i
saw
you
here
the
other
night
all
the
exciting
things
you
had
up
your
sleeve
right
up
to
baldpate
with
you
but
i
had
anything
up
my
sleeve
protested
magee
maybe
replied
the
agent
winking
there
some
pretty
giddy
stories
going
round
about
the
up
at
baldpate
shots
fired
and
strange
lights
flashing
it
the
only
thing
that
happened
here
in
years
and
i
was
in
on
it
i
certainly
wish
you
put
me
wise
to
it
by
the
way
inquired
magee
did
you
notice
the
passengers
from
here
on
the
train
last
night
repeated
the
agent
say
what
sort
of
hours
do
you
think
i
keep
a
man
has
to
get
some
sleep
even
if
he
does
work
for
a
railroad
i
was
here
at
last
night
young
cal
hunt
was
on
duty
then
he
home
and
in
bed
now
no
help
there
into
the
night
the
girl
and
the
two
hundred
thousand
had
fled
together
and
magee
could
only
wait
and
wonder
as
to
the
meaning
of
that
flight
two
drooping
figures
entered
the
station
the
mayor
and
his
faithful
lieutenant
max
the
dignity
of
the
former
had
faded
like
a
flower
and
the
same
withered
simile
might
have
been
applied
with
equal
force
to
the
accustomed
jauntiness
of
lou
good
morning
said
magee
in
greeting
taking
an
early
train
too
eh
have
a
pleasant
night
young
man
replied
cargan
if
you
ever
put
up
at
a
hotel
in
a
town
the
size
of
this
called
the
commercial
house
you
know
that
last
question
has
just
one
answer
manslaughter
i
heard
a
minister
say
once
that
all
drummers
are
bound
for
hell
if
they
are
it
be
a
pleasant
change
for
max
delved
beneath
his
overcoat
and
brought
forth
the
materials
for
a
cigarette
which
he
rolled
between
yellow
fingers
if
i
was
a
drummer
he
said
dolefully
one
breakfast
was
that
what
they
called
it
jim
one
breakfast
like
we
just
passed
through
would
drive
me
into
the
awful
habit
of
reading
one
of
these
here
books
of
sorry
smiled
magee
we
had
an
excellent
breakfast
at
quimby
really
you
should
have
stayed
by
the
way
where
is
bland
got
shaky
in
the
knees
said
cargan
afraid
of
the
reformers
had
much
experience
in
these
things
or
he
know
he
might
just
as
well
tremble
at
the
approach
of
a
fly
we
put
him
on
a
train
going
the
other
direction
from
reuton
early
this
morning
he
thinks
better
seek
his
fortune
elsewhere
he
leaned
in
heavy
confidence
toward
magee
say
young
fellow
he
whispered
put
me
wise
that
little
sleight
of
hand
game
you
worked
last
night
had
me
dizzy
where
the
coin
where
the
girl
what
the
game
take
the
boodle
and
welcome
it
ai
mine
but
put
me
next
to
what
doing
so
i
know
how
my
instalment
of
this
serial
story
ought
to
read
cargan
replied
magee
you
know
as
much
about
that
girl
as
i
do
she
asked
me
to
get
her
the
money
and
i
did
but
what
your
place
in
the
game
a
in
athens
returned
magee
translated
a
guy
who
had
bumped
into
a
cyclone
and
was
sitting
tight
waiting
for
it
to
blow
over
i
i
took
a
fancy
to
her
as
you
might
put
it
she
wanted
the
money
i
got
it
for
her
a
pretty
fairy
story
my
boy
the
mayor
commented
absolutely
true
smiled
magee
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
an
explanation
lou
inquired
cargan
she
asked
him
for
the
money
and
he
gave
it
to
her
max
leered
say
a
broadway
chorus
would
be
pleased
to
meet
you
magee
he
commented
do
tell
any
of
your
chorus
friends
about
me
replied
magee
i
might
not
always
prove
so
complacent
every
man
has
his
moments
of
falling
for
romance
even
you
probably
fell
once
and
what
a
fall
was
there
can
the
romance
stuff
pleaded
max
this
chilly
railway
station
was
meant
for
such
giddy
language
was
it
magee
looked
around
at
the
dingy
walls
at
the
soiled
at
the
disreputable
stove
no
place
for
romance
it
was
here
he
had
seen
her
first
in
the
dusk
weeping
bitterly
over
the
seemingly
hopeless
task
in
which
he
was
destined
to
serve
her
no
place
for
romance
and
here
had
begun
his
life
romance
the
blue
blithe
sailor
still
stood
at
attention
in
the
see
the
world
poster
magee
winked
at
him
he
knew
about
it
all
he
knew
he
knew
he
knew
how
alluring
she
had
looked
in
the
blue
corduroy
suit
the
bit
of
cambric
pressed
agonizingly
to
her
face
verily
even
the
sailor
of
the
posters
saw
the
world
and
all
its
glories
the
agent
leaned
his
face
against
the
bars
your
train
he
called
is
crossing
the
main
street
trestle
they
filed
out
upon
the
platform
magee
carrying
luggage
amid
her
effusive
thanks
on
the
platform
waited
a
stranger
equipped
for
travel
it
was
max
who
made
the
great
discovery
by
the
lord
harry
he
cried
it
the
hermit
of
baldpate
mountain
and
so
it
was
his
beard
gone
his
hair
clumsily
hacked
his
body
garbed
in
the
height
of
an
old
and
ludicrous
fashion
his
face
set
bravely
toward
the
cities
once
more
yes
he
said
i
walked
the
floor
thinking
it
all
over
i
knew
it
would
happen
and
it
has
the
winters
are
hard
and
the
sight
of
you
it
was
too
much
the
excitement
the
talk
it
did
for
me
did
for
my
oath
so
i
going
back
to
her
back
to
brooklyn
for
christmas
a
merry
one
to
you
growled
cargan
maybe
replied
peters
very
likely
if
she
feeling
that
way
i
hope
so
i
ai
giving
up
the
hermit
job
altogether
i
come
back
in
the
summers
to
my
business
there
money
in
it
if
handled
right
but
i
spent
my
last
winter
on
that
lonesome
hill
as
author
to
author
asked
magee
how
about
your
book
there
wo
be
any
mention
of
that
the
hermit
predicted
in
brooklyn
i
packed
it
away
maybe
i
can
work
on
it
summers
if
she
does
come
up
here
with
me
and
insist
on
running
my
hermit
business
for
me
i
hope
she
wo
it
would
sort
of
put
a
crimp
in
it
but
if
she
wants
to
i
wo
refuse
and
maybe
that
book
never
get
done
sometimes
as
i
sat
in
my
shack
at
night
and
read
it
come
to
me
that
all
the
greatest
works
since
the
world
began
have
been
those
that
never
got
finished
the
reuton
train
roared
up
to
them
through
the
gray
morning
and
paused
impatiently
at
upper
asquewan
falls
aboard
it
clambered
the
hermits
amateur
and
professional
magee
from
the
platform
waved
to
the
agent
standing
forlorn
in
the
station
door
he
watched
the
building
until
it
was
only
a
blur
in
the
dawn
a
kindly
feeling
for
it
was
in
his
heart
after
all
it
had
been
in
the
chapter
xx
the
admiral
game
the
village
of
upper
asquewan
falls
gave
a
correct
imitation
of
snow
upon
the
desert
dusty
face
and
was
no
more
bidding
a
reluctant
to
romance
magee
entered
the
solitary
day
coach
which
with
a
smoker
made
up
the
local
to
reuton
he
spent
a
few
moments
adjusting
norton
to
her
new
environment
and
listened
to
her
voluble
expressions
of
joy
in
the
fact
that
her
loomed
ahead
then
he
started
for
the
smoker
on
his
way
he
paused
at
the
seat
occupied
by
the
of
baldpate
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
pale
blue
necktie
peters
had
resurrected
for
his
return
to
the
world
of
men
pretty
ai
it
remarked
the
hermit
seeing
whither
magee
gaze
drifted
she
picked
it
i
did
exactly
like
it
when
she
first
gave
it
to
me
but
i
see
my
mistake
now
i
wearing
it
home
as
a
sort
of
a
white
flag
of
truce
or
almost
white
do
you
know
magee
somewhat
nervous
about
what
i
say
when
i
come
into
her
presence
again
about
my
inaugural
address
you
might
put
it
what
would
be
your
conversation
on
such
an
occasion
if
you
been
away
from
a
wife
for
five
years
what
would
you
say
when
you
drifted
back
that
would
depend
replied
magee
on
the
amount
of
time
she
allowed
me
for
my
speech
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
replied
peters
admiringly
quick
she
like
lightning
she
wo
give
me
any
time
if
she
can
help
it
that
why
i
like
to
have
a
wonderful
speech
all
ready
something
that
would
hold
her
spellbound
and
until
i
finished
it
would
take
a
literary
classic
to
do
that
what
you
want
laughed
magee
is
a
speech
with
the
punch
exactly
agreed
peters
i
guess
i
wo
go
over
to
brooklyn
the
minute
i
hit
new
york
i
guess
i
study
the
lights
along
the
big
street
and
brush
elbows
with
the
world
a
bit
before
i
reveal
myself
to
her
maybe
if
i
took
in
a
few
shows
but
do
think
i
wo
go
to
her
my
mind
is
made
up
and
i
guess
she
be
glad
to
see
me
too
in
her
way
i
got
to
fix
it
with
her
though
to
come
back
to
my
trade
in
the
summers
i
wonder
what
she
say
to
that
maybe
she
could
stay
at
the
inn
under
an
assumed
name
while
i
was
hermiting
up
at
the
shack
he
laughed
softly
it
be
funny
would
it
he
said
her
sitting
on
the
veranda
watching
me
sell
to
the
ladies
and
listening
to
the
various
stories
of
how
a
lost
love
has
blighted
my
life
and
so
forth
yes
be
real
funny
only
ellen
never
had
much
sense
of
humor
that
was
always
her
great
trouble
if
you
ever
marry
magee
and
i
suppose
you
will
take
my
advice
marry
a
sense
of
humor
first
and
a
woman
magee
promised
to
bear
this
counsel
in
mind
and
went
forward
into
the
long
rows
of
red
plush
seats
unoccupied
save
for
the
mayor
and
max
greeted
his
eye
he
strolled
to
where
they
sat
about
down
the
car
and
lighted
an
cigar
max
slouched
in
the
unresponsive
company
of
a
cigarette
on
one
side
of
the
car
across
the
aisle
the
mayor
of
reuton
leaned
heavily
above
a
placed
between
two
seats
he
was
playing
solitaire
magee
wondered
whether
this
was
merely
a
display
of
bravado
against
scheming
reformers
or
whether
cargan
found
in
it
real
diversion
curious
he
slid
into
the
place
across
the
table
from
the
mayor
napoleon
he
remarked
lightly
whiled
away
many
a
dull
hour
with
cards
i
believe
clumsily
the
mayor
shuffled
the
cards
he
flung
them
down
one
by
one
on
the
polished
surface
of
the
table
rudely
as
though
they
were
reform
votes
he
was
counting
his
thick
lips
were
tightly
closed
his
big
hands
hovered
with
unaccustomed
uncertainty
over
the
pasteboards
quit
your
kidding
he
replied
i
do
believe
cards
was
invented
in
nap
day
was
they
it
a
shame
a
fellow
ca
have
a
little
admiration
for
a
great
leader
like
nap
without
all
you
funny
boys
jollying
him
about
it
that
boy
sure
knew
how
to
handle
the
voters
read
a
lot
about
him
and
i
like
his
style
you
let
history
alone
snarled
max
across
the
aisle
or
repeat
itself
and
another
guy
i
know
go
to
the
island
if
you
mean
me
returned
cargan
forget
it
there
ai
no
helena
in
my
future
he
winked
at
magee
lou
a
little
peevish
this
morning
he
said
had
a
bad
night
he
busied
himself
with
the
cards
magee
looked
on
only
half
interested
then
suddenly
his
interest
grew
he
watched
the
mayor
build
in
two
piles
he
saw
that
the
deck
from
which
he
built
was
thick
a
weird
suspicion
shot
across
his
mind
tell
me
he
asked
is
this
the
admiral
game
of
solitaire
exactly
what
i
was
going
to
ask
said
a
voice
magee
looked
up
kendrick
had
come
in
and
stood
now
above
the
table
his
tired
eyes
were
upon
it
fascinated
his
lips
twitched
strangely
yes
answered
the
mayor
this
is
the
admiral
game
you
hardly
expect
me
to
know
it
would
you
i
do
hang
out
at
the
swell
clubs
where
the
admiral
does
they
wo
have
me
there
but
once
i
took
the
admiral
on
a
public
service
board
with
me
one
time
when
i
wanted
a
lot
of
dignity
and
no
brains
pretty
bad
and
he
sort
of
come
back
by
teaching
me
his
game
in
the
long
dull
hours
when
we
had
nothing
to
do
but
serve
the
public
the
thing
gets
a
hold
on
you
somehow
see
now
the
spade
now
the
heart
kendrick
leaned
closer
his
breath
came
with
a
noisy
quickness
that
brought
the
fact
of
his
breathing
insistently
to
magee
mind
i
never
knew
how
it
was
played
he
said
something
told
magee
that
he
ought
to
rise
and
drag
kendrick
away
from
that
table
why
he
did
not
know
still
it
ought
to
be
done
but
the
look
in
kendrick
eyes
showed
clearly
that
the
proverbial
wild
horses
could
not
do
it
then
tell
me
how
it
played
went
on
kendrick
trying
to
be
calm
you
must
be
getting
old
replied
the
mayor
the
admiral
told
me
the
young
men
at
his
club
never
took
any
interest
in
his
game
he
says
to
me
an
old
man
trade
it
a
great
game
mr
kendrick
a
great
game
repeated
kendrick
yes
it
a
great
game
his
tone
was
dull
i
want
to
know
how
it
played
he
said
again
the
six
of
clubs
reflected
the
mayor
throwing
down
another
card
say
she
going
fine
now
there
ai
much
to
it
you
use
two
decks
exactly
alike
shuffle
together
the
eight
of
hearts
the
jack
of
say
that
great
you
lay
the
cards
down
here
just
as
they
come
like
this
he
paused
his
huge
hand
held
a
giddy
pasteboard
a
troubled
look
was
on
his
face
then
he
smiled
happily
and
went
on
in
triumph
and
then
you
build
kendrick
he
said
the
reds
and
the
blacks
you
build
the
blacks
on
the
left
and
the
reds
on
the
right
do
you
get
me
then
say
what
the
matter
for
kendrick
had
swayed
and
almost
fallen
on
the
admiral
game
the
game
that
had
once
sent
a
man
to
hell
go
on
he
said
bracing
nothing
the
matter
go
on
build
damn
it
build
the
mayor
looked
at
him
a
moment
in
surprise
then
continued
now
the
king
he
muttered
now
the
ace
we
on
the
home
stretch
going
strong
there
it
finished
it
come
out
right
a
great
game
i
tell
you
he
leaned
back
kendrick
face
was
like
a
bronze
mask
his
eyes
were
fiercely
on
the
table
and
the
two
decks
of
cards
that
lay
there
and
when
you
finished
he
pointed
when
you
finished
cargan
picked
up
the
deck
on
the
left
all
black
he
said
when
the
game
comes
out
right
and
the
other
kendrick
persisted
softly
he
pointed
to
the
remaining
deck
a
terrible
smile
of
understanding
drew
his
thin
lips
taut
and
the
other
mr
cargan
red
replied
cargan
what
else
could
it
be
all
red
he
picked
it
up
and
shuffled
through
it
to
prove
his
point
kendrick
turned
like
a
drunken
man
and
staggered
back
down
the
aisle
magee
rose
and
hurried
after
him
at
the
door
he
turned
and
the
look
on
his
face
caused
magee
to
shudder
you
heard
he
said
helplessly
my
god
it
funny
is
it
he
laughed
hysterically
and
drawing
out
his
handkerchief
passed
it
across
his
forehead
a
pleasant
thing
to
think
about
a
pleasant
thing
to
remember
professor
bolton
pushed
open
the
smoker
door
i
thought
i
join
you
he
began
why
david
what
is
it
what
the
matter
nothing
replied
kendrick
wildly
there
nothing
the
matter
let
me
by
please
he
crossed
the
swaying
platform
and
disappeared
into
the
other
car
for
a
moment
the
professor
and
magee
gazed
after
him
and
then
without
a
word
moved
down
the
car
to
join
cargan
and
max
magee
mind
was
dazed
by
the
tragedy
he
had
witnessed
a
pleasant
thing
to
think
about
he
did
not
envy
kendrick
his
thoughts
the
mayor
of
reuton
had
pushed
aside
the
cards
and
lighted
a
huge
cigar
well
doc
he
remarked
jocosely
how
trade
sold
any
new
schemes
for
renovating
the
world
to
the
rubes
i
should
think
this
would
be
sort
of
an
for
the
reform
business
peace
on
earth
good
will
toward
men
that
ai
exactly
a
good
advertisement
for
the
reformers
is
it
it
an
excellent
one
replied
professor
bolton
the
first
essential
of
good
will
toward
men
is
not
to
rob
and
debauch
them
oh
well
doc
do
let
argue
the
matter
replied
cargan
easily
i
ai
in
the
humor
for
it
anyhow
you
got
your
beliefs
and
i
got
my
beliefs
and
that
ai
no
reason
why
we
should
not
smoke
a
couple
of
good
cigars
together
have
one
thanks
i
reluctantly
the
old
man
took
a
havana
from
the
mayor
huge
fist
you
very
kind
i
suppose
it
sort
of
a
blow
to
you
the
mayor
went
on
that
your
plans
up
there
on
the
mountain
went
all
to
smash
it
ought
to
teach
you
a
lesson
doc
there
ai
nothing
to
the
reform
gag
the
train
slowed
down
at
a
small
yellow
station
magee
peered
out
the
window
hooperstown
he
read
reuton
miles
he
saw
max
get
up
and
leave
the
car
not
a
thing
to
it
doc
cargan
repeated
your
bunch
has
tried
to
get
me
before
you
shouted
from
the
housetops
that
you
had
the
goods
on
me
what
always
happened
your
own
creatures
have
acquitted
you
replied
the
professor
from
a
cloud
of
cargan
cigar
smoke
men
decided
that
i
had
done
wrong
i
tell
you
doc
there
dishonest
graft
and
i
against
that
always
and
there
honest
graft
the
rightful
perquisites
of
a
high
office
that
the
trouble
with
you
church
politicians
you
ca
see
the
difference
between
the
two
i
not
a
church
politician
protested
the
professor
i
bitterly
opposed
to
the
crowd
who
continually
rant
against
the
thing
they
do
understand
i
practical
as
practical
as
you
and
when
noiselessly
max
slid
up
to
the
group
and
stood
silent
his
eyes
wide
his
yellow
face
pitiful
the
fear
of
a
dog
about
to
be
whipped
in
his
every
feature
jim
he
cried
jim
you
got
to
get
me
out
of
this
you
got
to
stand
by
me
why
what
the
matter
lou
asked
the
mayor
in
surprise
matter
enough
whined
max
do
you
know
what
happened
well
tell
max
was
thrust
aside
and
replaced
by
a
train
newsboy
magee
felt
that
he
should
always
remember
that
boy
his
straw
colored
hair
his
freckled
beaming
face
his
lips
with
their
fresh
perpetual
smile
all
the
morning
papers
gents
proclaimed
the
boy
get
the
all
about
the
bribery
he
held
up
the
paper
it
huge
black
looked
dull
and
old
and
soggy
but
the
story
they
told
was
new
and
live
and
startling
the
mayor
trapped
shrilled
the
attempt
to
pass
big
bribe
at
baldpate
inn
foiled
by
star
reporter
hayden
of
the
suburban
commits
suicide
to
avoid
disgrace
give
me
a
paper
boy
said
the
mayor
yes
a
his
voice
was
even
his
face
unmoved
he
took
the
sheet
and
studied
it
with
an
easy
smile
clinging
in
fear
to
his
side
max
read
too
at
length
cargan
spoke
looking
up
at
magee
so
he
remarked
so
reporters
eh

and
your
lady
friend
reporters

this
lying
sheet
the
magee
smiled
up
from
his
own
copy
of
the
paper
not
i
he
answered
but
my
lady
friend
yes
it
seems
she
was
just
that
a
reporter
you
can
call
her
and
tell
no
lie
mr
mayor
chapter
xxi
the
mayor
is
welcomed
home
it
was
a
good
story
the
story
which
the
mayor
max
the
professor
and
magee
read
with
varying
emotions
there
in
the
the
girl
had
served
her
employers
well
and
magee
as
he
read
felt
a
thrill
of
pride
in
her
evidently
the
employers
had
felt
that
same
thrill
for
in
the
captions
under
the
pictures
in
the
and
in
a
editorial
none
of
which
the
girl
had
written
the
spoke
admiringly
of
its
woman
reporter
who
had
done
a
man
work
who
had
gone
to
baldpate
inn
and
had
brought
back
a
gigantic
bribe
fund
alone
and
unaided
indeed
smiled
magee
to
himself
in
the
editorial
on
that
first
page
the
triumphant
cry
of
the
arose
to
shatter
its
fellows
in
the
heavens
at
last
said
the
editor
the
long
campaign
which
his
paper
alone
of
all
the
reuton
papers
had
waged
against
a
corrupt
city
administration
was
brought
to
a
successful
close
the
victory
was
won
how
had
this
been
accomplished
into
the
office
had
come
rumors
a
few
days
back
of
the
proposed
payment
of
a
big
bribe
at
the
inn
on
baldpate
mountain
the
paper
had
decided
that
one
of
its
representatives
must
be
on
the
ground
it
had
debated
long
whom
to
send
miss
evelyn
rhodes
its
special
writer
had
got
the
tip
in
question
she
had
pleaded
to
go
to
the
inn
the
editor
considering
her
sex
had
sternly
refused
then
gradually
he
had
been
brought
to
see
the
wisdom
of
sending
a
girl
rather
than
a
man
the
sex
of
the
former
would
put
the
guilty
parties
under
surveillance
off
guard
so
miss
rhodes
was
despatched
to
the
inn
here
was
her
story
it
convicted
cargan
beyond
a
doubt
the
very
money
offered
as
a
bribe
was
now
in
the
hands
of
the
editor
and
would
be
turned
over
to
prosecutor
drayton
at
his
request
all
this
under
the
disquieting
title
prison
stripes
for
the
mayor
the
girl
story
told
how
with
one
companion
she
had
gone
to
upper
asquewan
falls
there
was
no
mention
of
the
station
nor
of
the
tears
shed
therein
on
a
certain
evening
magee
noted
she
had
reached
the
inn
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
the
combination
was
to
be
phoned
bland
was
already
there
shortly
after
came
the
mayor
and
max
you
got
to
get
me
out
of
this
magee
heard
max
pleading
over
shoulder

still
replied
the
mayor
roughly
he
was
reading
his
copy
of
the
with
keen
interest
now
i
done
your
dirty
work
for
years
whined
max
who
puts
on
the
rubber
shoes
and
sneaks
up
dark
alleys
hunting
votes
among
the
garbage
while
you
do
the
old
glory
stunt
on
main
street
i
do
you
got
to
get
me
out
of
this
it
may
mean
jail
i
could
stand
that
i
die
a
horrible
parody
of
a
man
real
fear
was
in
his
face
the
mayor
shook
himself
as
though
he
would
be
rid
forever
of
the
coward
hanging
on
his
arm
hush
up
ca
you
he
said
i
see
you
through
you
got
to
lou
max
wailed
miss
rhodes
story
went
on
to
tell
how
hayden
refused
to
phone
the
combination
how
the
mayor
and
max
dynamited
the
safe
and
secured
the
precious
package
only
to
lose
it
in
another
moment
to
a
still
different
contingent
at
the
inn
how
hayden
had
come
of
his
suicide
when
he
found
that
his
actions
were
in
danger
of
exposure
a
bitter
smile
for
kendrick
in
that
reflected
magee
and
how
finally
through
a
strange
series
of
accidents
the
money
came
into
the
hands
of
the
writer
for
the
these
accidents
were
not
given
in
detail
an
amusing
feature
of
the
whole
affair
said
miss
evelyn
rhodes
was
the
presence
at
the
inn
of
william
hallowell
magee
the
new
york
writer
of
light
fiction
who
had
come
there
to
escape
the
distractions
of
a
great
city
and
to
work
in
the
solitude
and
who
immediately
on
his
arrival
became
involved
in
the
surprising
drama
of
baldpate
i
an
amusing
feature
reflected
magee
magee
continued
miss
rhodes
will
doubtless
be
one
of
the
state
chief
witnesses
when
the
case
against
cargan
comes
to
trial
as
will
also
professor
thaddeus
bolton
holder
of
the
crandall
chair
of
comparative
literature
at
reuton
university
and
david
kendrick
formerly
of
the
suburban
but
who
retired
six
years
ago
to
take
up
his
residence
abroad
the
latter
two
went
to
the
inn
to
represent
prosecutor
drayton
and
made
every
effort
in
their
power
to
secure
the
package
of
money
from
the
reporter
for
the
not
knowing
her
connection
with
the
affair
well
mr
magee
asked
professor
bolton
laying
down
the
paper
which
he
had
been
perusing
at
a
distance
of
about
an
inch
from
his
nose
once
again
professor
laughed
magee
reporters
have
entered
your
life
the
old
man
sighed
it
was
very
kind
of
her
he
said
not
to
mention
that
i
was
the
person
who
compared
blondes
of
the
peroxide
variety
with
suffragettes
others
will
not
be
so
kind
the
matter
will
be
resurrected
and
used
against
me
at
the
trial
i
sure
a
plucky
girl
magee
a
very
plucky
girl
how
times
do
change
when
i
was
young
girls
of
her
age
would
scarcely
have
thought
of
venturing
forth
into
the
highways
on
such
perilous
missions
i
congratulate
you
you
showed
unusual
perception
you
deserve
a
great
reward
the
young
lady
favor
let
us
say
you
got
to
get
me
out
of
this
max
was
still
telling
the
mayor
for
god
sake
cried
cargan
shut
up
and
let
me
think
he
sat
for
a
moment
staring
at
one
place
his
face
still
lacking
all
emotion
but
his
eyes
a
trifle
narrower
than
before
you
have
got
me
yet
he
cried
standing
up
by
the
eternal
i
fight
to
the
last
ditch
and
win
i
show
drayton
he
ca
play
this
game
on
me
i
show
the
that
dirty
sheet
has
hounded
me
for
years
i
put
it
out
of
business
and
i
send
the
reformers
howling
into
the
alleys
sick
of
the
fuss
they
started
themselves
perhaps
said
professor
bolton
but
only
after
the
fight
of
your
life
cargan
i
ready
for
it
cried
cargan
i
ai
down
and
out
yet
but
to
think
a
woman
a
little
bit
of
a
girl
i
could
have
put
in
my
pocket
it
all
a
big
joke
i
beat
them
i
show
them
the
far
from
played
out
i
win
and
if
i
do
he
crumbled
suddenly
into
his
seat
his
eyes
on
that
unpleasant
line
about
prison
stripes
for
the
mayor
for
an
instant
it
seemed
as
though
his
fight
was
irrevocably
lost
and
he
knew
it
lines
of
age
appeared
to
creep
from
out
the
fat
folds
of
his
face
and
stand
mockingly
there
he
looked
a
beaten
man
if
i
do
he
stammered
pitifully
well
they
sent
him
to
an
island
at
the
end
the
reformers
got
napoleon
at
the
last
i
wo
be
alone
in
that
at
this
unexpected
sight
of
weakness
in
his
hero
max
set
up
a
renewed
babble
of
fear
at
his
side
the
train
was
in
the
reuton
suburbs
now
at
a
neat
little
station
it
slowed
down
to
a
stop
and
a
florid
policeman
entered
the
cargan
looked
up
hello
dan
he
said
his
voice
was
lifeless
the
ring
was
gone
the
policeman
removed
his
helmet
and
shifted
it
nervously
i
thought
i
tell
you
cargan
he
said
i
thought
i
warn
you

off
here

a
big
crowd

sir
and
go
on
a
car
if
the
mighty
cargan
had
looked
limp
and
beaten
for
a
moment
he
looked
that
way
no
more
he
stood
up
and
his
head
seemed
almost
to
touch
the
roof
of
the
car
over
that
big
patrolman
he
towered
his
eyes
were
cold
and
hard
again
his
lips
curved
in
the
smile
of
the
master
and
why
he
bellowed
should
i
get
off
here

me
that
dan

the

crowd

streets

the
first
paving
stone
under

but
jim
cargan
wo
be
in
the
mollycoddle
class
for
a
century
or
two
yet
yes
sir
said
the
patrolman
admiringly
he
hurried
out
of
the
car
and
the
mayor
turned
to
find
lou
max
pale
and
fearful
by
his
side
what
ails
you
now
he
asked
i
afraid
cried
max
did
you
hear
what
he
said
a
mob
i
saw
a
mob
once
never
again
for
me
he
tried
to
smile
to
pass
it
off
as
a
pleasant
jest
but
he
had
to
wet
his
lips
with
his
tongue
before
he
could
go
on
come
on
jim
get
off
here
do
be
a
fool
the
train
began
to
move
get
off
yourself
you
coward
sneered
cargan
oh
i
know
you
it
does
take
much
to
make
your
stomach
shrink
get
off
max
eagerly
seized
his
hat
and
bag
i
will
if
you
do
mind
he
said
see
you
later
at
charlie
and
in
a
flash
of
tawdry
attire
he
was
gone
the
mayor
of
reuton
no
longer
sat
limp
in
his
seat
that
brief
moment
of
seeming
surrender
was
put
behind
forever
he
walked
the
aisle
of
the
car
fire
in
his
eyes
battle
in
his
heart
so
they
waiting
for
me
eh
he
said
aloud
waiting
for
jim
cargan
now
ai
it
nice
of
them
to
come
and
meet
their
mayor
magee
and
the
professor
went
into
the
day
coach
for
their
baggage
norton
motioned
to
the
former
well
she
said
you
know
now
i
suppose
and
it
did
do
you
no
harm
to
wait
i
sure
am
glad
this
is
all
over
and
that
child
is
safe
and
i
hope
you
remember
what
i
said
it
ai
no
work
for
a
woman
no
how
what
with
the
shooting
and
the
late
hours
your
words
said
magee
are
engraven
on
my
heart
he
proceeded
to
gather
her
baggage
with
his
own
and
was
thus
engaged
when
kendrick
came
up
the
shadow
of
his
discovery
in
the
an
hour
before
still
haunted
his
sunken
eyes
but
his
lips
were
half
smiling
with
the
new
joy
of
living
that
had
come
to
him
magee
he
began
i
hardly
need
mention
that
the
terrible
thing
which
happened
in
there
is
between
you
and
me
and
the
man
who
dead
no
one
must
know
least
of
all
the
girl
who
is
to
become
my
wife
it
would
embitter
her
whole
life
as
it
has
mine
do
say
that
magee
pleaded
you
will
forget
in
time
i
sure
and
you
may
trust
me
i
had
forgotten
already
and
indeed
he
had
on
the
instant
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
miss
thornhill
approached
her
dark
smiling
eyes
on
magee
kendrick
looked
at
her
proudly
and
spoke
suddenly
determinedly
you
right
i
will
forget
she
shall
help
me
magee
said
the
girl
i
so
pleased
at
the
splendid
end
to
your
impulsive
philanthropy
i
just
knew
the
adventure
could
have
anything
but
a
happy
ending
it
was
so
full
of
youth
and
faith
and
and
charity
or
its
synonym
this
must
be
you
must
come
and
see
me
come
and
see
us
all
i
shall
be
happy
to
answered
magee
sincerely
it
will
always
be
a
matter
of
regret
to
me
that
i
was
not
able
to
serve
you
also
on
baldpate
mountain
but
out
of
it
you
come
with
something
more
precious
than
fine
gold
and
that
shall
be
my
consolation
let
it
be
smiled
myra
thornhill
as
it
is
surely
mine
and
good
luck
whispered
magee
as
he
took
kendrick
hand
over
his
shoulder
as
he
passed
to
the
platform
he
saw
them
look
into
each
other
eyes
and
he
felt
that
the
memory
of
the
admiral
game
would
in
time
cease
to
haunt
david
kendrick
a
shadow
had
fallen
upon
the
train
the
shadow
of
the
huge
reuton
station
in
the
on
the
platform
magee
encountered
the
mayor
of
reuton
above
the
lessening
roar
of
the
train
there
sounded
ahead
of
them
the
voices
of
men
in
turmoil
and
riot
cargan
turned
upon
magee
a
face
as
placid
and
dispassionate
as
that
of
one
who
enters
an
apple
orchard
in
may
the
boys
he
smiled
grimly
welcoming
me
home
then
the
train
came
to
a
stop
and
magee
looked
down
into
a
great
array
of
faces
and
heard
for
the
first
time
the
low
unceasing
rumble
of
an
angry
mob
afterward
he
marveled
at
that
constant
guttural
roar
how
it
went
on
and
on
humming
like
a
tune
never
stopping
disconnected
quite
from
the
occasional
shrill
or
heavy
voices
that
rang
out
in
distinguishable
words
the
mayor
looked
coolly
down
into
those
upturned
faces
he
listened
a
moment
to
the
rumble
of
a
thousand
throats
then
he
took
off
his
derby
with
satiric
politeness
glad
to
see
one
and
all
he
cried
and
now
above
the
mutterings
angry
words
could
be
heard
that
him
that
cargan
how
the
weather
on
baldpate
and
other
sarcastic
flings
then
a
fashion
of
derisive
came
and
went
after
which
here
and
there
voices
spoke
of
ropes
of
tar
and
feathers
and
still
the
mayor
smiled
as
one
for
whom
the
orchard
gate
swung
open
in
may
a
squad
of
policemen
who
had
entered
the
car
from
the
rear
forced
their
way
out
on
to
the
platform
want
us
to
see
you
through
the
crowd
mr
cargan
the
lieutenant
asked
new
hoots
and
cries
ascended
to
the
station
rafters
who
pays
the
police
we
do
who
owns
cargan
thus
question
and
answer
were
bandied
back
and
forth
again
a
voice
demanded
in
strident
tones
the
ignominious
tar
and
feathers
jim
cargan
had
not
risen
from
the
slums
to
be
master
of
his
town
without
a
keen
sense
of
the
theatric
he
ordered
the
police
back
into
the
car
and
stay
there
he
demanded
the
lieutenant
demurred
one
look
from
the
mayor
sent
him
scurrying
cargan
took
from
his
pocket
a
big
cigar
and
calmly
lighted
it
some
of
them
guys
out
there
he
remarked
to
magee
belong
to
the
crowd
pretty
actions
for
them
pillars
of
the
church
howling
like
beasts
and
still
like
that
of
beasts
the
mutter
of
the
mob
went
on
now
in
an
undertone
now
louder
and
still
that
voice
that
first
had
plead
for
tar
and
feathers
plead
still
for
feathers
and
tar
and
here
a
group
preferred
the
rope
and
toward
them
with
the
bland
smile
of
a
child
on
his
great
face
his
cigar
tilted
at
one
angle
his
derby
at
another
the
mayor
of
reuton
walked
unflinchingly
the
roar
became
mad
defiant
but
cargan
stepped
forward
boldly
now
he
reached
the
leaders
of
the
mob
he
pushed
his
way
in
among
them
smiling
but
determined
they
closed
in
on
him
a
little
man
got
firmly
in
his
path
he
took
the
little
man
by
the
shoulders
and
stood
him
aside
with
some
friendly
word
and
now
he
was
past
ten
rows
or
more
of
them
on
his
way
through
and
the
crowd
began
to
scurry
away
they
scampered
like
ants
clawing
at
one
another
backs
to
make
a
path
and
so
finally
between
two
rows
of
them
the
mayor
of
reuton
went
his
way
triumphantly
somewhere
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
an
admiring
voice
spoke
hello
jim
the
mayor
waved
his
hand
the
rumble
of
their
voices
ceased
at
last
jim
cargan
was
still
master
of
the
city
say
what
you
will
remarked
magee
to
the
professor
as
they
stood
together
on
the
platform
of
the
car
there
goes
a
man
he
did
not
wait
to
hear
the
professor
answer
for
he
saw
the
girl
of
the
upper
asquewan
station
standing
on
a
baggage
truck
far
to
the
left
of
the
mob
wave
to
him
over
their
heads
eagerly
he
fought
his
way
to
her
side
it
was
a
hard
fight
the
crowd
would
not
part
for
him
as
it
had
parted
for
the
man
who
owned
the
city
chapter
xxii
the
usual
thing
hello
man
the
girl
seized
magee
proffered
hand
and
leaped
down
from
the
truck
to
his
side
bless
the
gods
of
the
mountain
said
magee
they
have
given
me
back
my
accomplice
safe
and
sound
they
were
black
lonesome
gods
she
replied
and
they
kept
whispering
fearful
things
in
my
ear
i
could
understand
i
glad
they
keep
me
so
am
i
the
crowd
surged
about
them
many
in
it
smiled
and
spoke
admiringly
to
the

row
of
such
vehicles
norton

the
girl
following

like

always
putting
me
in
a
cab
remarked
the
older
woman
as
she
climbed
inside
i
do

what
mary

me
would
have
done
if
it
had
been
for
you
you
a
mighty
handy
person
to
have
around
magee
ai
he
dearie
she
winked
openly
at
magee
and
a
delightful
one
agreed
the
girl
in
a
tone
norton
was
driven
away
up
the
snowy
street
as
magee
and
the
girl
turned
they
beheld
the
hermit
of
baldpate
staring
with
undisguised
exultation
at
the
tall
buildings
of
reuton
why
it
mr
peters
the
girl
cried
yes
replied
magee
his
prediction
has
come
true
we
and
our
excitement
proved
too
much
for
him
he
going
back
to
brooklyn
and
to
her
i
so
glad
she
cried
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
the
hermit
he
took
it
somewhat
embarrassed
glad
to
see
you
he
said
you
certainly
appear
to
have
stirred
things
up
miss
but
women
are
good
at
that
i
always
said
magee
tells
me
you
going
back
after
all
she
broke
in
yes
returned
peters
i
knew
it
i
told
you
so
it
was
all
right
in
the
summer
when
the
bands
played
and
the
warm
wind
was
hermiting
on
the
mountain
too
but
in
the
fall
it
always
been
hard
and
heard
the
white
lights
calling
calling
why
i
even
heard
her
heard
ellen
this
fall
you
came
and
there
was
something
doing
on
baldpate
and
i
knew
that
when
you
went
i
just
naturally
have
to
go
too
so
i
going
splendid
commented
the
girl
it
be
somewhat
delicate
continued
the
hermit
bursting
in
on
ellen
after
all
these
years
as
i
told
magee
i
wish
i
had
an
inaugural
address
or
something
like
that
i
have
it
responded
evelyn
rhodes
i
write
a
story
about
you
for
morning
paper
all
about
how
the
christmas
spirit
has
overcome
the
hermit
of
baldpate
and
how
he
going
back
to
his
wife
with
his
heart
filled
with
love
for
her
it
is
filled
is
it
well
yes
agreed
peters
i
reckon
you
might
call
it
that
and
then
you
can
send
her
a
copy
of
the
paper
and
follow
it
up
in
person
a
good
idea
commented
billy
magee
at
first
glance
yes
studied
peters
but
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
the
death
knell
of
my
business
and
i
calculating
to
go
back
to
baldpate
next
summer
and
take
it
up
again
no
i
afraid
i
ca
let
it
be
generally
known
that
i
quit
living
in
a
shack
on
the
mountain
for
love
of
somebody
or
other
once
more
smiled
magee
big
business
muzzles
the
press

ai
obliged
to
you

the
hermit
of

the
girl

i
wish

best
of

merry
christmas

the
hermit
heartily

miss
rhodes
and
i
will
see

predicted
magee
next
summer
at
baldpate
inn
the
hermit
looked
at
the
girl
who
turned
her
face
away
i
hope

out
that
way
i
sure
he
said
i
let
you
have
a
reduction
on
all
just
for
old
times
sake
now
i
must
find
out
about
the
new
york
trains
he
melted
into
the
crowd
an
odd
figure
still
his
garb
in
a
fashion
long
forgotten
his
clumsily
hacked
hair
brushing
the
collar
of
his
ancient
coat
magee
and
the
girl
found
the
check
room
and
after
he
had
been
relieved
of
the
burden
of
his
baggage
set
out
up
the
main
street
of
reuton
it
was
a
typical
town
deep
in
the
throes
of
the
holiday
season
the
windows
of
the
stores
were
green
with
holly
the
faces
of
the
reflected
the
excitements
of
christmas
and
of
the
upheaval
in
civic
politics
which
were
upon
them
almost
together
tell
me
said
the
girl
are
you
glad
at
the
way
it
has
turned
out
are
you
glad
i
was
no
lady
captain
kidd
it
has
all
turned
out
or
is
about
to
turn
out
beautifully
magee
answered
you
may
remember
that
on
the
veranda
of
baldpate
inn
i
spoke
of
one
summer
hotel
flirtation
that
was
going
to
prove
more
than
that
let
me
her
laugh
interrupted
you
do
even
know
my
name
what
the
matter
with
evelyn
rhodes
suggested
magee
nothing
it
a
perfectly
good
name
but
it
is
mine
i
just
write
under
it
i
prefer
mary
anyhow
smiled
billy
magee
she
called
you
that
mary
mary
what
you
have
no
idea
said
he
how
immaterial
that
is
they
came
upon
a
throng
blocking
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
a
tall
building
of
stone
the
eyes
of
the
throng
were
on
bulletins
it
muttered
much
as
they
had
muttered
who
gathered
in
the
station
the
office
of
the
explained
the
girl
the
crowd
is
looking
for
new
excitement
do
you
know
for
two
whole
hours
this
morning
we
had
on
exhibition
in
the
window
a
certain
package
a
package
of
money
i
think
smiled
magee
i
seen
it
somewhere
i
think
you
have
drayton
came
and
took
it
from
us
as
soon
as
he
heard
but
it
was
the
very
best
proof
we
could
have
offered
the
people
they
like
to
see
for
themselves
it
a
passion
with
them
we
done
for
cargan
forever
cargan
says
he
will
fight
of
course
he
will
she
replied
but
this
will
prove
waterloo
whether
or
not
he
is
sent
to
prison
and
perhaps
he
can
escape
that
he
very
clever
his
power
in
reuton
is
broken
he
ca
possibly
win
at
the
next
election
it
comes
very
soon
i
so
glad
for
years
our
editor
has
been
fighting
corruption
in
the
face
of
terrible
odds
and
temptations
i
so
glad
it
over
now
and
the
has
won
through
you
said
magee
softly
with
some
one
to
help
she
smiled
i
must
go
now
and
find
out
what
new
task
is
set
for
me
magee
postponed
the
protest
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
and
climbing
the
gloomy
stairs
that
newspapers
always
affect
they
came
into
the
city
room
of
the
though
the
paper
had
been
long
on
the
street
the
excitement
of
the
greatest
coup
of
years
still
lingered
in
the
place
magee
saw
the
deferential
smiles
that
greeted
the
girl
and
watched
her
as
she
made
her
way
to
the
city
editor
desk
in
a
moment
she
was
back
at
his
side
i
got
my
assignment
she
smiled
ruefully
they
descended
to
the
street
it
wonderful
she
went
on
how
curt
a
city
editor
can
be
with
any
one
who
pulls
off
a
good
story
the
job
i
got
now
reminds
me
of
the
experience
of
an
old
new
york
reporter
who
used
to
work
on
the
with
difficulty
they
threaded
their
way
through
the
crowd
and
moved
along
beside
the
windows
he
was
the
first
man
sent
out
by
his
paper
on
park
row
on
the
spanish
war
assignment
she
went
on
and
he
behaved
rather
brilliantly
i
believe
well
he
came
back
after
the
fight
was
over
all
puffed
up
and
important
and
they
told
him
the
city
editor
wanted
him
going
to
send
me
to
the
philippines
he
told
me
he
thought
as
he
went
into
the
presence
when
the
city
editor
ordered
him
to
rush
down
to
a
fire
in
houston
street
he
nearly
collapsed
i
know
how
he
felt
i
feel
that
way
now
what
was
it
a
fire
asked
magee
no
she
replied
a
sweet
little
story
about
the
christmas
toys
done
it
to
death
every
christmas
for
three
years
oh
well
i
can
do
it
again
but
it
have
to
wait
until
after
norton
lunch
she
led
him
into
a
street
where
every
house
was
like
its
neighbor
even
to
the
rooms
sign
in
the
windows
and
up
the
steps
of
one
she
could
have
recognized
only
by
counting
from
the
corner
they
entered
the
murky
and
stereotyped
atmosphere
of
a
hallway
with
its
inevitable
and
the
uncollected
letters
of
the
homeless
on
a
table
norton
came
breezily
forth
to
meet
them
well
magee
she
said
i
certainly
am
glad
you
came
i
busy
on
that
lunch
now
dearie
show
him
into
the
parlor
to
wait
magee
was
shown
in
that
parlor
seemed
to
moan
dismally
as
it
received
him
he
strolled
about
and
gazed
at
the
objects
of
art
which
had
at
various
times
accrued
to
norton
personality
a
steel
engraving
called
which
depicted
an
angry
father
arriving
at
a
church
door
to
find
his
eloping
daughter
in
the
arms
of
stalwart
youth
with
the
clergy
looking
on
approvingly
another
of
john
drew
assuming
a
commanding
posture
as
petruchio
in
taming
of
the
some
ennuied
flabby
angels
riding
on
the
clouds
a
child
of
unhealthy
pink
clasping
lovingly
an
inflammable
dog
on
the
mantel
a
miniature
ship
under
glass
and
some
lady
statuettes
whose
toilettes
slipped
down
down
and
on
an
easel
the
sad
portrait
of
a
gentleman
undoubtedly
the
late
lamented
norton
his
uninteresting
nose
appeared
to
turn
up
at
the
constant
odor
of
cookery
in
which
it
dwelt
his
hair
was
plastered
down
over
his
forehead
in
a
gorgeous
abandoned
curve
such
as
some
of
the
least
sophisticated
of
john
mccutcheon
gentlemen
affect
magee
stared
round
the
room
and
smiled
was
the
romance
of
reality
never
to
resemble
the
romance
of
his
dreams
where
were
the
dim
lights
where
the
distant
waltz
where
the
magic
of
moonlight
amid
which
he
was
some
day
to
have
told
a
beautiful
girl
of
his
love
hardly
in
norton
parlor
she
came
and
stood
in
the
doorway
hatless
coatless
smiling
she
flooded
the
place
with
her
beauty
magee
looked
at
the
flabby
angels
on
the
wall
expecting
them
to
hide
their
faces
in
shame
but
no
they
still
rode
brazenly
their
unstable
clouds
come
in
he
cried
do
leave
me
alone
here
again
please
and
tell
me
is
this
the
gentleman
who
took
the
contract
for
making
norton
happy
i
i
ca
come
in
she
said
blushing
she
seemed
to
wish
to
avoid
him
yes
that
is
mr
norton
she
came
nearer
the
easel
and
smiled
at
the
late
lamented
tonsorial
crown
i
must
leave
you
just
a
moment
billy
magee
heart
beat
wildly
his
breath
came
fast
he
seized
her
by
the
hand
you
never
going
to
leave
me
again
he
cried
do
you
know
that
i
thought
you
knew
you
mine
i
love
you
i
love
you
it
all
i
can
say
my
dearest
look
at
me
look
at
me
please
it
has
happened
so
quickly
she
murmured
things
ca
be
true
when
they
happen
so
quickly
a
woman
logic
said
magee
it
has
happened
my
beautiful
girl
look
at
me
and
then
she
looked
trembling
flushed
half
frightened
half
exultant
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
my
little
girl
he
cried
down
at
her
a
moment
longer
she
held
off
and
then
limply
she
surrendered
and
billy
magee
held
her
close
in
his
arms
take
care
of
me
she
whispered
i
i
love
you
so
her
arm
went
timidly
about
his
shoulders
do
you
want
to
know
my
name
it
mary
mary
what
the
answer
was
seemingly
of
no
importance
for
lips
were
on
hers
crushing
the
word
at
its
birth
so
they
stood
amid
norton
gloomy
objects
of
art
and
presently
she
asked
how
about
the
book
dear
but
magee
had
forgot
what
book
he
asked
the
novel
you
went
to
baldpate
to
write
do
you
remember
dearest
no
melodrama
no
wild
chase
no
love
why
magee
paused
for
a
moment
in
the
joy
of
his
discovery
then
he
came
back
to
the
greater
joy
in
his
arms
why
darling
he
explained
gently
this
is
it
the
end
