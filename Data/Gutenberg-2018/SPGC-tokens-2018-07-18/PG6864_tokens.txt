chapter
i
the
trombone
three
men
sat
in
the
cosmic
club
discussing
the
question
what
the
matter
with
jones
waldemar
the
oldest
of
the
conferees
was
the
owner
and
at
times
the
operator
of
an
important
and
decent
newspaper
his
heavy
face
wore
the
expression
of
power
characteristic
of
the
experienced
and
successful
journalist
beside
him
sat
robert
bertram
the
club
idler
slender
and
languidly
elegant
the
third
member
of
the
conference
was
jones
himself
average
jones
had
come
by
his
nickname
inevitably
his
parents
had
foredoomed
him
to
it
when
they
furnished
him
with
the
initials
as
preface
to
his
birthright
of
j
for
jones
his
character
apparently
justified
the
chance
concomitance
he
was
so
to
speak
a
composite
photograph
of
any
thousand
americans
between
the
ages
of
and
thirty
happily
his
otherwise
commonplace
face
was
relieved
by
the
one
unfailing
characteristic
of
composite
photographs
large
and
thoughtful
eyes
otherwise
he
would
have
passed
in
any
crowd
and
nobody
would
have
noticed
him
pass
now
at
he
looked
back
over
the
five
years
since
his
graduation
from
college
and
wondered
what
he
had
done
with
them
and
at
the
four
previous
years
of
undergraduate
life
and
wondered
how
he
had
done
so
well
with
those
and
why
he
had
not
in
some
manner
justified
the
parting
words
of
his
favorite
professor
you
have
one
rare
faculty
jones
you
can
when
you
choose
sharpen
the
pencil
of
your
mind
to
a
very
fine
point
specialize
my
boy
if
the
recipient
of
this
admonition
had
specialized
in
anything
it
was
in
life
having
thousand
a
year
of
his
own
he
might
have
continued
in
that
path
indefinitely
but
for
two
influences
one
was
an
irruptive
craving
within
him
to
take
some
part
in
the
dynamic
activities
of
the
surrounding
world
the
other
was
the
freak
will
of
his
late
and
uncle
from
whom
he
had
his
present
income
and
his
future
expectations
of
some
ten
millions
adrian
van
reypen
egerton
had
as
waldemar
once
put
it
one
into
the
mayor
chair
with
a
good
name
and
come
out
with
a
block
of
ice
in
a
will
whose
cynical
humor
was
the
topic
of
its
day
egerton
jeered
posthumously
at
the
public
which
he
had
despoiled
and
promised
restitution
of
a
sort
through
his
heir
therefore
he
had
written
i
give
and
bequeath
to
the
said
adrian
van
reypen
egerton
jones
the
residue
of
my
property
the
principal
to
be
taken
over
by
him
at
such
time
as
he
shall
have
completed
five
years
of
continuous
residence
in
new
york
city
after
such
time
the
virus
of
the
metropolis
will
have
worked
through
his
entire
being
he
will
squander
his
unearned
and
undeserved
fortune
thus
completing
the
vicious
circle
and
returning
the
millions
acquired
by
my
political
activities
in
a
poisoned
shower
upon
the
city
for
which
having
bossed
bullied
and
looted
it
i
feel
no
sentiment
other
than
and
now
remarked
waldemar
in
his
heavy
rumbling
voice
you
aspire
to
disappoint
that
good
old
it
only
human
nature
you
know
said
average
jones
when
a
man
puts
a
curse
on
you
and
suggests
that
you
have
the
backbone
of
a
shrimp
you
you
naturally
yearn
to
prove
him
a
liar
supplied
bertram
exactly
anyway
i
no
taste
for
dissipation
either
moral
or
financial
i
want
action
something
to
do
i
bored
in
this
infernal
the
wail
of
the
unslaked
romanticist
commented
bertram
romanticist
nothing
protested
the
other
my
ambitions
are
practical
enough
if
i
could
only
get
stirred
exactly
boredom
is
simply
romanticism
with
a
thirst
you
panting
for
romance
for
something
bizarre
egypt
and
petersburg
and
buenos
ayres
and
samoa
have
all
become
commonplace
to
you
you
overdone
them
that
why
you
back
here
in
new
york
waiting
with
stretched
nerves
for
the
adventure
of
life
to
up
from
behind
and
toss
the
lariat
of
rainbow
dreams
over
your
waldemar
laughed
not
a
bad
diagnosis
why
do
you
take
up
a
hobby
jones
what
kind
of
a
hobby
any
kind
the
club
is
full
of
of
all
people
that
i
know
they
have
the
keenest
appetite
for
life
look
at
old
denechaud
he
was
a
misanthrope
until
he
took
to
gathering
scarabs
fenton

has
the
finest
collection
of

terriberry
has
a
mania
for
old
railroad
tickets
some
are
really
very
curious
often
wished
i
had
the
time
to
be
a
crank
it
a
happy
what
line
would
you
choose
asked
bertram
languidly
nobody
has
gone
in
for
queer
advertisements
yet
i
believe
replied
the
older
man
if
one
could
take
the
time
to
follow
them
up
it
would
mean
all
one
would
it
be
so
demanding
a
career
said
average
jones
smiling
decidedly
i
once
knew
a
man
who
gave
away
twenty
dollars
daily
on
clues
from
the
day
news
he
was
bored
for
lack
of
but
the
ordinary
run
of
advertising
is
nothing
more
than
an
effort
to
sell
something
by
yelling
in
print
objected
average
jones
is
it
well
perhaps
you
do
look
in
the
right
waldemar
reached
for
the
morning
copy
of
the
universal
and
ran
his
eye
down
the
columns
of
classified
matter
hark
to
this
he
said
and
read
is
there
any
work
on
god
green
earth
for
a
man
who
has
just
got
to
have
it
or
this
wanted
a
venerable
looking
man
with
white
beard
and
medical
degree
good
pay
to
right
what
that
asked
average
jones
with
awakened
interest
only
a
quack
medical
concern
looking
for
a
stall
to
impress
their
explained
waldemar
average
jones
leaned
over
to
scan
the
paper
in
his
turn
here
one
said
he
and
read
wanted
performer
on
trombone
can
use
at
once
apply
with
instrument
after
east
street
that
seems
ordinary
enough
said
waldemar
what
it
doing
in
a
daily
paper
there
must
be
er
technical
publications
er
journals
you
know
for
this
sort
of
when
average
words
come
slow
you
got
him
interested
commented
bertram
sure
nevertheless
he
right
said
waldemar
it
is
rather
how
is
this
for
one
that
says
what
it
means
said
bertram
wanted
at
once
a
brass
howitzer
and
a
man
who
is
afraid
to
handle
it
anne
cullen
pier
east
river
the
woman
who
is
fighting
the
barge
combine
explained
waldemar
not
so
good
as
it
looks
she
anyway
i
like
a
shy
at
this
business
declared
average
jones
with
sudden
conviction
it
looks
to
me
like
something
to
make
it
a
business
then
advised
waldemar
if
you
care
really
to
go
in
for
it
my
newspaper
would
be
glad
to
pay
for
information
such
as
you
might
collect
we
have
time
for
example
to
trace
down
fraudulent
advertisers
if
you
could
start
an
enterprise
of
that
sort
certainly
find
it
amusing
and
at
times
perhaps
even
i
would
know
how
to
establish
it
objected
average
jones
the
newspaper
owner
drew
a
rough
diagram
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
filled
it
in
with
writing
crossing
out
and
revising
liberally
divided
upon
his
pattern
into
lines
the
final
draft
read
have
you
been
stung
thousands
have
thousands
will
be
they
laying
for
you
who
the
advertising
crooks
jones
can
protect
you
against
them
before
spending
your
money
call
on
him
advice
on
all
subjects
connected
with
newspaper
magazine
or
display
advertising
free
consultation
to
persons
unable
to
pay
call
or
write
enclosing
postage
this
is
on
the
level
do
you
expect
me
to
blight
my
budding
career
by
a
poisonous
pun
like
that
demanded
average
jones
with
a
wry
face
it
may
be
a
poisonous
pun
but
it
an
arresting
said
waldemar
unmoved
single
column
about
fifty
lines
will
do
it
in
nice
open
style
caps
and
lower
case
and
type
for
the
name
and
title
insert
twice
a
week
in
every
new
york
and
brooklyn
is
it
er
a
little
blatant
suggested
bertram
with
lifted
eyebrows
blatant
repeated
its
inventor
it
more
than
that
it
howlingly
vulgar
it
a
riot
of
glaring
yellow
how
else
would
you
expect
to
catch
the
public
suppose
then
i
do
burst
into
flame
to
this
effect
queried
the
prospective
et
apres
as
we
proudly
say
after
spending
a
week
in
apres
oh
plenty
of
things
you
hire
an
office
a
clerk
two
stenographers
and
a
clipping
export
and
prepare
to
take
care
of
the
work
that
comes
in
you
be
flooded
promised
waldemar
and
between
times
i
to
go
skipping
about
chasing
long
white
whiskers
and
brass
howitzers
and
trombones
i
until
you
get
your
work
systematized
you
have
no
time
for
skipping
within
six
months
if
you
not
sandbagged
or
jailed
on
fake
libel
suits
you
have
a
unique
bibliography
of
swindles
then
i
begin
to
come
and
buy
your
knowledge
to
keep
my
own
columns
the
speaker
looked
up
to
meet
the
gaze
of
an
man
with
a
harsh
sallow
face
excuse
my
interrupting
said
the
just
one
question
waldemar
who
going
to
be
the
nominee
linder
surely
not
why
his
name
has
been
it
will
his
federal
job
he
resigns
in
two
his
record
will
kill
what
record
you
and
i
know
he
a
grafter
but
can
we
prove
anything
his
clerk
has
always
handled
all
the
was
there
an
old
scandal
a
woman
case
asked
the
questioner
vaguely
that
washington
man
wife
too
old
linder
would
deny
it
flatly
and
there
would
be
no
witnesses
the
woman
is
dead
killed
by
his
brutal
treatment
of
her
they
say
but
the
whole
thing
was
hushed
up
at
the
time
by
linder
pull
and
when
the
husband
threatened
to
kill
him
linder
quietly
set
a
commissioner
of
insanity
on
the
case
and
had
the
man
put
away
he
never
appeared
since
no
that
would
be
politically
the
gray
man
nodded
and
walked
away
musing
egbert
the
traction
boss
explained
waldemar
we
generally
on
opposite
sides
but
this
time
we
both
against
linder
egbert
wants
a
cheaper
man
for
mayor
i
want
a
straighter
one
and
i
could
get
him
this
year
if
linder
was
so
well
fortified
however
to
get
back
to
our
project
jones
get
back
to
it
they
did
with
such
absorption
that
when
the
group
broke
up
several
hours
later
average
jones
was
committed
by
plan
and
rote
to
the
new
and
hopeful
adventure
of
life
in
the
great
human
hunt
which
ever
has
been
and
ever
shall
be
till
the
last
bird
flies
into
the
last
light
some
call
it
business
some
call
it
art
some
call
it
love
and
a
very
few
know
it
for
what
it
is
the
very
mainspring
of
existence
the
path
of
the
pursuer
and
the
prey
often
run
obscurely
parallel
what
time
the
honorable
william
linder
matured
his
designs
on
the
mayoralty
average
jones
sat
in
a
suite
of
offices
in
astor
court
a
location
which
waldemar
had
advised
as
being
central
expensive
and
inspirational
of
confidence
and
considered
with
a
whirling
brain
the
minor
woes
of
humanity
other
people
troubles
had
swarmed
down
upon
him
in
answer
to
his
advertised
offer
of
help
as
sparrows
flock
to
scattered
bread
crumbs
mostly
these
were
of
the
lesser
order
of
difficulties
but
for
what
he
gave
in
advice
and
help
the
took
payment
in
experience
and
knowledge
of
human
nature
still
it
was
the
hard
honest
study
and
the
helpful
toil
which
held
him
to
his
task
rather
than
the
romance
and
adventure
which
he
had
hoped
for
and
waldemar
had
foretold
until
in
a
quiet
street
in
brooklyn
of
which
he
had
never
so
much
as
heard
there
befell
that
which
first
of
many
events
justified
the
prophetic
waldemar
and
gave
average
jones
a
part
in
the
greater
drama
of
the
metropolis
the
party
of
the
second
part
was
the
honorable
william
linder
linder
sat
at
five
of
an
early
summer
day
behind
lock
and
bolt
the
third
floor
front
room
of
his
ornate
mansion
on
park
slope
was
dedicated
to
peaceful
thought
sprawled
in
a
huge
and
softly
upholstered
chair
at
the
window
he
took
his
ease
in
his
house
the
chair
had
been
a
recent
gift
from
an
anonymous
admirer
whose
political
necessities
the
honorable
linder
idly
surmised
had
not
yet
driven
him
to
reveal
his
identity
its
occupant
stretched
his
shoeless
feet
as
was
his
custom
upon
the
broad
flooded
by
the
seasonable
warmth
of
sunshine
the
while
he
considered
the
ripening
mayoralty
situation
he
found
it
highly
satisfactory
in
the
language
of
his
inner
man
it
was
a
cinch
below
in
kennard
street
a
solitary
musician
plodded
his
brass
rested
against
his
shoulder
he
appeared
to
be
the
scout
of
one
of
those
prevalent
and
melancholious
german
bands
which
under
brooklyn
easy
ordinances
are
privileged
to
draw
echoes
of
the
past
writhing
from
their
forgotten
recesses
the
man
looked
slowly
about
him
as
if
apprising
potential
returns
his
gravid
glance
encountered
the
prominent
feet
in
the
third
story
window
of
the
linder
mansion
and
rested
he
moved
forward
opposite
the
window
he
paused
he
raised
the
mouthpiece
to
his
lips
and
embarked
on
a
perilous
sea
of
notes
from
which
the
tutored
ear
might
have
inferred
that
once
popular
ditty
egypt
love
of
music
was
not
one
of
the
honorable
william
linder
attributes
an
irascible
temper
was
of
all
instruments
the
trombone
possesses
the
most
tone
the
master
of
the
mansion
leaped
from
his
restful
chair
where
his
feet
had
ornamented
the
coping
his
face
now
appeared
far
out
he
leaned
and
roared
at
the
musician
below
the
brass
throat
blared
back
at
him
while
the
soloist
his
eyes
closed
in
the
ecstasy
of
art
brought
the
verse
part
of
his
selection
to
an
excruciating
conclusion
half
a
tone
below
pitch
before
the
chorus
there
was
a
brief
pause
for
effect
in
this
pause
from
open
face
a
voice
fell
like
a
falling
star
although
it
did
not
cry
excelsior
its
output
of
vocables
might
have
been
mistaken
by
a
casual
ear
for
that
clarion
call
what
the
honorable
linder
actually
shouted
was
getthehelloutofhere
the
performer
upturned
a
mild
and
vacant
face
what
you
say
he
inquired
in
a
softly
teutonic
accent
the
honorable
william
linder
made
urgent
gestures
like
a
brakeman
go
away
move
on
the
musician
smiled
reassuringly
i
got
already
paid
for
this
he
explained
up
went
the
brass
to
his
lips
again
the
tonal
stairway
which
leads
up
to
the
chorus
of
egypt
rose
in
rasping
wailfulness
it
culminated
in
an
excessive
unendurable
brazen
shriek
and
the
honorable
william
linder
experienced
upon
the
undefended
rear
of
his
person
the
most
violent
kick
of
a
lifetime
not
always
devoted
to
the
arts
of
peace
it
projected
him
clear
of
the
his
last
sensible
vision
was
the
face
of
the
musician
the
mouth
absurdly
hollow
and
pursed
above
the
suddenly
removed
mouthpiece
then
an
awning
intercepted
the
politician
flight
he
passed
through
this
penetrated
a
second
and
similar
stretch
of
canvas
shading
the
next
window
below
and
lay
placid
on
his
own
front
steps
with
three
ribs
caved
in
and
a
variegated
fracture
of
the
by
the
time
the
descent
was
ended
the
german
musician
had
tucked
his
brass
under
his
arm
and
was
hurrying
in
panic
down
the
street
his
ears
still
ringing
with
the
concussion
which
had
blown
the
angry
householder
from
his
own
front
window
he
was
intercepted
by
a
running
policeman
where
was
the
explosion
demanded
the
officer
explosion
i
hear
a
noise
in
the
larch
house
on
the
corner
replied
the
musician
dully
the
policeman
grabbed
his
arm
come
along
back
you
fer
a
witness
come
on
you
an
yer
it
iss
not

explained
the
german
patiently

with
several
million
other
readers
average
jones
followed
the
linder
bomb
outrage
through
the
scandalized
of
the
local
press
the
perpetrator
declared
the
excited
journals
had
been
skilful
no
clue
was
left
the
explosion
had
taken

the

with
the
characteristic
stupidity
of
a
corps
of
former
and
bartenders
decorated
with
brass
buttons
and
shields
and
without
further
qualification
dubbed
detectives
vacillated
from
theory
to
theory
their
fantasies
did
not
long
survive
the
honorable
william
linder
return
to
consciousness
and
coherence
an
inside
job
they
had
said
the
door
was
locked
and
bolted
linder
declared
and
there
was
no
possible
place
for
an
intruder
to
conceal
himself
then
how
would
any
human
being
guess
what
time
to
set
it
for
demanded
the
politician
in
disgust
when
i
never
know
myself
where
i
going

of

propounded
the

ponderously
of
course
tossed
it
right
up
three
stories
and
kept
playing
his
infernal
trombone
with
the
other
hand
all
the
time
you
ought
to
be
carrying
a
hod
nevertheless
the
police
hung
tenaciously
to
the
theory
that
the
musician
was
involved
chiefly
because
they
had
nothing
else
to
hang
to
the
explosion
had
been
very
localized
the
room
not
generally
wrecked
but
the
chair
which
seemed
to
be
the
center
of
disturbance
and
from
which
the
honorable
william
linder
had
risen
just
in
time
to
save
his
life
was
blown
to
pieces
and
a
portion
of
the
floor
beneath
it
was
much
shattered
the
force
of
the
explosion
had
been
from
above
the
floor
downward
not
up
through
the
flooring
as
to
murderously
inclined
foes
linder
disclaimed
knowledge
of
any
the
notion
that
the
trombonist
had
given
a
signal
he
derided
as
an
old
sleuth
as
time
went
on
and
clues
came
to
nothing
the
police
had
no
greater
concern
than
quietly
to
forget
according
to
custom
a
problem
beyond
their
limited
powers
with
the
release
of
the
german
musician
who
was
found
to
be
to
the
verge
of
public
interest
waned
and
the
case
faded
out
of
current
print
average
jones
who
was
much
occupied
with
a
pair
of
blackmailers
operating
through
faked
photographs
about
that
time
had
almost
forgotten
the
linder
case
when
one
day
a
month
after
the
explosion
waldemar
dropped
in
at
the
astor
court
offices
he
found
a
changed
jones
much
thinner
and
finer
than
when
eight
weeks
before
he
had
embarked
on
his
new
career
at
the
newspaper
owner
instance
the
young
man
color
was
less
pronounced
and
his
eyes
though
alert
and
eager
showed
rings
under
them
you
have
found
the
work
interesting
i
take
it
remarked
the
visitor
ra
ather
drawled
average
jones
appreciatively
that
was
a
good
initial
effort
running
down
the
opium
pill
it
was
simple
enough
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
catchword
in
the
anything
is
easy
to
a
man
who
sees
returned
the
older
man
sententiously
the
open
eye
of
the
open
mind
that
has
more
to
do
with
real
detective
work
than
all
the
deduction
and
induction
and
analysis
ever
it
is
the
detective
part
that
interests
me
most
in
the
game
but
i
have
had
much
of
it
yet
you
have
run
across
any
promising
ads
lately
have
you
waldemar
wide
florid
brow
wrinkled
i
have
thought
or
dreamed
of
anything
for
a
month
but
this
infernal
bomb
oh
the
linder
case
you
personally
interested
politically
it
makes
linder
nomination
certain
persecution
attempted
assassination
he
becomes
a
i
almost
ready
to
believe
that
he
planted
a
fake
bomb
and
fell
out
of
a
window
to
carry
out
the
idea
pushing
realism
rather
far
is
it
waldemar
laughed
there
the
weakness
unless
we
suppose
that
he
the
charge
of
they
let
the
musician
go
did
they
yes
there
was
absolutely
no
proof
against
him
except
that
he
was
in
the
street
below
besides
he
seemed
quite
lacking
might
that
have
been
a
sham
alienists
of
good
standing
examined
him
they
reported
him
just
a
shade
better
than
he
was
like
a
child
his
whole
being
comprised
in
his
ability
and
ambition
to
play
his
well
if
i
needed
an
accomplice
said
average
jones
thoughtfully
i
would
want
any
better
one
than
a
man
did
he
play
well
atrociously
and
if
you
know
what
a
blare
exudes
from
a
trombone
waldemar
lifted
expressive
hands
within
average
jones
overstocked
mind
something
stirred
at
the
repetition
of
the
words
somewhere
they
had
attracted
his
notice
in
print
and
somehow
they
were
connected
with
waldemar
then
from
amidst
the
hundreds
of
advertisements
with
which
in
the
past
weeks
he
had
crowded
his
brain
one
stood
out
clear
it
voiced
the
desire
of
an
unknown
gentleman
on
the
near
border
of
harlem
for
the
services
of
a
performer
upon
that
instrument
one
among
several
it
had
been
cut
from
the
columns
of
the

the
evening
which
had
launched
him
upon
his
new
enterprise
average

made
two
steps
to
a
bookcase
took
down
a
huge
from
an
alphabetized
row
and
turned
the
leaves
rapidly
three
hundred

one

said
he
slamming
the

shut
again
three
hundred
east
one

you
wo
mind
will
you
he
said
to
waldemar
if
i
leave
you
unceremoniously
recalled
a
forgotten
engagement
asked
the
other
rising
yes
no
i
mean
i
going
to
harlem
to
hear
some
music
the
nearest
station
is
it
thanks
so
waldemar
rubbed
his
head
thoughtfully
as
the
door
slammed
behind
the
speeding
now
what
kind
of
a
tune
is
he
on
the
track
of
i
wonder
he
mused
i
wish
it
had
struck
him
until
i
had
time
to
go
over
the

business
with

while
waldemar
rubbed
his

in
cogitatation
and
the

in
his
brooklyn
headquarters
breathed
charily
out
of
respect
to
his
creaking

was
following

northward
three

east
one

decrepit
with
a
disease
of
the

its

eyes
are
rheumy
it
sags
backward
on

joints
all
its
poor
old
bones
creak
when
the
winds
shake
it
to
average
jones
inquiring
gaze
on
this
summer
day
it
opposed
the
secrecy
of
a
senile
indifference
he
hesitated
to
pull
at
its
lest
by
that
act
he
should
exert
a
disruptive
force
which
might
bring
all
the
frail
structure
rattling
down
in
ruin
when
at
length
he
forced
himself
to
the
summons
the
merest
ghost
of
a
tinkle
complained
petulantly
from
within
against
his
violence
an
old
lady
came
to
the
door
she
was
sleek
and
placid
round
and
comfortable
she
did
not
seem
to
belong
in
that
house
at
all
average
jones
felt
as
if
he
had
cracked
open
one
of
the
grisly
locust
shells
which
cling
lifelessly
to
tree
trunks
and
had
found
within
a
plump
and
prosperous
beetle
was
an
advertisement
for
a
trombone
player
inserted
from
this
house
he
inquired
long
ago
said
she
am
i
too
late
then
much
it
was
answered
nearly
two
months
since
i
have
never
said
the
old
lady
with
conviction
seen
such
a
frazzled
lot
of
folks
as
trombone
the
person
who
inserted
the
advertisement
has
left
a
month
could
you
tell
where
he
went
left
no
his
name
was
telford
was
it
said
average
jones
strategically
might
be
said
the
old
lady
who
had
evidently
formed
no
favorable
impression
of
her
but
he
called
himself
he
had
a
furnished
room
the

third
floor
is
it

said
the

abruptly
and
with
suspicion
all
varieties
replied
her
prospective
lodger
cheerfully
i
will
bring
with
my
for
five
successive
evenings
thereafter
average
jones
sat
in
the
senile
house
awaiting
personal
response
to
the
following
advertisement
which
he
had
inserted
in

have
had

as

between
the
ebb
and
flow
of
applicant
musicians
he
read
exhaustively
upon
the
unallied
subjects
of
trombones
and
high
explosives
or
talked
with
his
landlady
who
proved
to
be
a
sociable
person
not
disinclined
to
discuss
the
departed
guest
ransom
his
supplanter
learned
had
come
light
and
gone
light
two
dress
suit
cases
had
sufficed
to
bring
in
all
his
belongings
he
went
out
but
little
and
then
she
opined
with
a
disgustful
sniff
for
purposes
strictly
alcoholic
parcels
came
for
him
occasionally
these
were
usually
labeled
glass

with
oh
there
was
one
other
thing
a
huge
easy
from
carruthers
and
company
mighty
luxurious
for
an
lodger
did
he
take
that
with
him
asked
average
jones
no
after
he
had
been
here
a
while
he
had
a
man
come
in
and
box
it
up
he
must
have
sent
it
away
but
i
never
saw
it
was
this
before
or
after
the
trombone
players
came
long
after
it
was
after
he
had
picked
out
his
man
and
had
him
up
here
did
er
you
ever
er
see
this
musician
drawled
average
jones
in
the
slow
tones
of
his
peculiar
excitement
bless
you
yes
talked
with
what
was
he
like
he
was
a
stupid
old
german
i
always
thought
he
was
a
sort
of
a
yes
average
jones
peered
out
of
the
window
is
this
the
man
coming
up
the
street
it
surely
is
said
the
old
lady
now
mister
jones
if
he
commences
his
blaring
and
blatting
and
there
be
no
more
music
promised
the
young
man
laughing
as
she
went
out
to
answer
the
the
musician
ushered
in
looked
about
him
an
expression
of
bewildered
and
childish
surprise
on
his
face
i
am
schlichting
he
murmured
i
come
to
play
the
glad
to
see
you
schlichting
said
average
jones
leading
the
way
sit
the
visitor
put
his
trombone
down
and
shook
his
head
with
conviction
it
iss
the
same
room
yes
he
observed
but
it
iss
not
the
same
gent
you
expected
to
find
mr
ransom
here
i
do
know
mr
ransom
i
know
only
to
play
the
mr
ransom
the
gentleman
who
employed
you
to
play
in
the
street
in
schlichting
made
large
and
expansive
gestures
it
iss
a
pleasure
to
play
for
such
a
gent
he
said
warmly
two
dollars
a
you
have
played
often
in
kennard
street
i
do
know
kennard
street
i
know
only
to
play
the
kennard
street
in
brooklyn
where
the
fat
gentleman
told
you
to
stop
and
fell
out
of
the
a
look
of
fear
overspread
the
worn
and
innocent
face
i
do
go
there
no
more
the
they
take
but
you
had
gone
there
before
not
to
play
not
to
play
are
you
sure
the
german
considered
painfully
there
vass
no
feet
in
the
window
he
explained
brightening
upon
that
surprising
phrase
average
jones
pondered
you
were
not
to
play
unless
there
were
feet
the
window
he
said
at
length
was
that
it
the
musician
assented
it
does
look
like
a
signal
to
show
that
linder
was
in
mused
the
interrogator
do
you
know
linder
i
do
know
nothing
only
to
play
the
trombone
repeated
the
other
patiently
now
schlichting
said
average
jones
here
is
a
dollar
every
evening
you
must
come
here
whether
i
am
here
or
not
there
will
be
a
dollar
for
you
do
you
understand
by
way
of
answer
the
german
reached
down
and
listed
his
instrument
to
his
lips
no
not
that
forbade
average
jones
put
it
not
to
play
my
trombone
asked
the
other
innocently
hurt
the
other
gent
he
make
play
here
did
he
drawled
average
jones
and
he
er
listened
he
listened
from
out
the
musician
pointed
to
the
other
room
how
long
different
times
was
the
placid
reply
but
he
was
always
in
the
other
always
and
i
play
egypt
like
no
said
average
jones
as
the
other
stretched
out
a
hopeful
hand
he
liked
it
egypt
said
the
german
wistfully
he
said
encore
bis
sometimes
nine
sometimes
ten
times
over
i
play
it
the
and
then
he
sent
you
home
then
sometimes
something
goes
like
that
in
the
back
room
then
he
comes
out
and
i
may
go
um
m
muttered
average
jones
discontentedly
when
did
you
begin
to
play
in
the
street
after
a
long
time
he
take
me
away
to
brooklyn
and
tell
me
you
see
the
feet
iss
in
the
window
you
play
hard
there
was
a
long
pause
then
average
jones
asked
casually
did
you
ever
notice
a
big
easy
chair
here
i
do
not
notice
nothing
i
play
my
and
there
his
limitations
were
established
but
the
old
lady
had
something
to
add
it
all
true
that
he
said
she
confirmed
i
could
hear
his
racket
in
the
front
room
and
mr
ransom
working
in
the
back
and
then
after
the
old
man
was
gone
mr
ransom
sweeping
up
something
by
sweeping
what
er
was
he
er
sweeping
glass
i
think
the
girl
used
to
find
little
slivers
of
it
first
in
one
part
of
the
room
then
in
another
i
raised
the
rent
for
that
and
for
the
the
next
thing
said
average
jones
is
to
find
out
where
that
big
easy
chair
went
from
here
can
you
help
me
there
the
old
lady
shook
her
head
all
i
can
do
is
to
tell
you
the
truck
canvass
of
the
local
trucking
industry
brought
to
light
the
conveyor
of
that
elegant
article
of
furniture
it
had
gone
average
jones
learned
not
to
the
mansion
of
the
honorable
william
linder
as
he
had
fondly
hoped
but
to
an
obscure
address
not
far
from
the
navy
yard
in
brooklyn
to
this
address
having
looked
up
and
gathered
in
the
trombonist
average
jones
led
the
way
the
pair
lurked
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
ramshackle
house
watching
the
entrance
until
toward
evening
as
the
door
opened
to
let
out
a
tremulous
wreck
of
a
man
palsied
with
debauch
schlichting
observed
that
iss
him
he
hass
been
drinking
again
average
jones
hurried
the
musician
around
the
corner
into
concealment
you
have
been
here
before
to
meet
mr
ransom
where
did
he
meet
you
to
pay
you
your
wages
on
some
corner
said
the
other
vaguely
then
he
took
you
to
the
big
house
and
left
you
there
urged
jones
no
he
left
me
on
the
street
corner
the
feet
iss
in
the
window
he
says
play
it
comes
to
this
drawled
average
jones
intently
looking
the
employee
between
his
vacuous
eyes
ransom
shipped
the
chair
to
plymouth
street
and
from
there
to
linder
house
he
figured
out
that
linder
would
put
it
in
his
study
and
do
his
sitting
at
the
window
in
it
and
you
were
to
know
when
he
was
there
by
seeing
his
feet
in
the
window
and
give
the
signal
when
you
saw
him
it
must
have
been
a
signal
to
somebody
pretty
far
off
or
he
would
have
chosen
so
loud
an
instrument
as
a
i
can
play
the
trombone
louder
as
any
man
in
the
business
asserted
schlichting
with
proud
conviction
but
what
gets
me
pursued
average
jones
is
the
purpose
of
the
signal
whom
was
it
for
i
do
know
nothing
said
the
other
complacently
i
only
know
to
play
the
trombone
louder
as
any
man
in
the
average
jones
paid
him
a
lump
sum
dismissed
him
and
returned
to
the
cosmic
club
there
to
ponder
the
problem
what
next
to
accuse
ransom
the
mysterious
hirer
of
a
trombone
virtuosity
without
sufficient
proof
upon
which
to
base
even
a
claim
of
would
be
to
block
his
own
game
then
and
there
for
ransom
could
and
very
likely
would
go
away
leaving
no
trace
who
was
ransom
anyway
and
what
relation
if
any
did
he
bear
to
linder
absorbed
in
these
considerations
he
failed
to
notice
that
the
club
was
filling
up
beyond
its
wont
a
hand
fell
on
his
shoulder
hello
average

seen
you
at
a

waldemar

at
our
table
come
and
join
conversation
at
the
was
general
and
lively
that
evening
and
not
until
the
port
came
on
the
prideful
club
port
served
only
on
special
occasions
and
in
wonderful
delicate
glasses
did
average
jones
get
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
waldemar
aside
i
been
looking
into
that
linder
matter
a
indeed
i
about
given
up
you
spoke
of
an
old
scandal
in
linder
career
what
was
the
name
arbuthnot
i
do
you
know
what
sort
of
looking
man
he
was
no
i
could
find
out
from
what
was
his
business
government
employment
i
in
the
er
scientific
line
perhaps
drawled
jones
why
yes
i
believe
it
suppose
now
linder
should
drop
out
of
the
combination
who
would
be
the
most
likely
nominee
marsden
the
man
i
been
grooming
for
the
place
a
honorable
fearless
well
it
only
a
chance
but
if
i
can
get
one
dark
point
cleared
up
he
paused
as
a
curious
tingling
note
came
from
the
platform
where
the
musicians
were
tuning
tip
one
of
bellerding
sweet
dulcets
observed
bertram
the
performer
nearest
them
was
running
a
slow
bass
scale
on
a
sort
of
of
a
strange
shape
average
jones
still
untouched
glass
almost
full
of
the
precious
port
trembled
and
sang
a
little
tentative
response
mounted
the
thrilling
notes
in
crescendo
force
what
a
racking
sort
of
tone
for
all
its
sweetness
said
average
jones
his
delicate
and
fragile
port
glass
evidently
shared
the
opinion
for
without
further
warning
it
split
and
shivered
they
used
to
show
that
experiment
in
the
laboratory
said
bertram
you
must
have
had
just
the
accurate
amount
of
liquid
in
the
glass
average
move
back
you
lunatic
it
dripping
all
over
but
average
jones
sat
unheeding
the
liquor
dribbled
down
into
his
lap
he
kept
his
fascinated
gaze
fixed
on
the
shattered
glass
bertram
dabbed
him
with
a
napkin
tha
a
anks
bertram
drawled
the
beneficiary
of
this
attention
does
matter
excuse
me
good
leaving
his
surprised
companions
he
took
hat
and
cane
and
caught
a
third
avenue
car
by
the
time
he
had
reached
brooklyn
bridge
he
had
his
campaign
mapped
out
it
all
depended
upon
the
opening
question
average
jones
decided
to
hit
out
and
hit
quick
at
the
house
near
the
navy
yard
he
learned
that
his
man
was
out
so
he
sat
upon
the
front
steps
while
one
of
the
wines
in
new
york
dried
into
his
knees
shortly
before
eleven
a
shuffling
figure
paused
at
the
steps
feeling
for
a
key
mr
arbuthnot
otherwise
ransom
said
average
jones
blandly
the
man
chin
jerked
back
his
jaw
dropped
would
you
like
to
hire
another
trombonist
pursued
the
young
man
who
are
you
gasped
the
other
what
do
you
want
i
want
to
know
drawled
average
jones
how
planted
the
glass
bulb
er
the
sulphuric
acid
bulb
you
know
in
the
chair
that
you
sent
er
to
the
honorable
william
linder
so
that
er
it
would
be
shattered
by
anything
but
the
middle
c
note
of
a
trombone
the
man
sat
down
weakly
and
bowed
his
face
in
his
hands
presently
he
looked
up
i
do
care
he
said
come
at
the
end
of
an
hour
talk
arbuthnot
alias
ransom
agreed
to
everything
that
average
jones
proposed
mind
you
he
said
i
do
promise
i
wo
kill
him
later
but
meantime
it
be
some
satisfaction
to
put
him
down
and
out
politically
you
can
find
me
here
any
time
you
want
me
you
say
you
see
linder
said
average
jones
in
the
next
day
papers
for
the
setting
his
telephone
receiver
down
the
honorable
william
linder
lost
himself
in
conjecture
he
had
just
given
an
appointment
to
his
tried
and
true
but
quite
impersonal
enemy
horace
waldemar
what
can
waldemar
want
of
me
ran
his
thoughts
and
who
is
this
friend
jones
that
he
bringing
jones
jones
jones
he
tried
it
in
three
different
accents
without
extracting
any
particular
meaning
therefrom
nothing
much
in
the
political
game
he
decided
it
was
with
a
mingling
of
gruffness
and
dignity
that
he
greeted
waldemar
an
hour
later
the
introduction
to
average
jones
he
acknowledged
with
a
curt
nod
want
a
job
for
this
young
man
waldemar
he
grunted
not
at
present
thank
you
returned
the
newspaper
owner
mr
jones
has
a
few
arguments
to
present
to
arguments
repeated
the
honorable
william
lender
contemptuously
what
kind
of
arguments
political
arguments
mayoralty
to
be
specific
to
be
more
specific
still
arguments
showing
why
you
should
drop
out
of
the
a
reformer
eh
the
politician
turned
to
meet
average
jones
steady
gaze
and
mildly
inquiring
smile
do
you
er
know
anything
of
submarine
mines
linder
drawled
the
visitor
huh
returned
the
honorable
william
linder
startled
submarine
mines
explained
the
mines
in
the
sea
if
you
wish
words
of
one
the
lids
of
the
honorable
linder
contracted
you
in
the
wrong
joint
he
said
this
ai
the
naval
thank
you
a
submarine
mine
is
a
very
ingenious
affair
i
recently
been
reading
somewhat
extensively
on
the
subject
the
main
charge
is
some
high
explosive
usually
of
the
dynamite
type
above
it
is
a
small
jar
of
sulphuric
acid
teeth
working
on
levers
surround
this
jar
the
levers
project
outside
the
mine
when
a
ship
strikes
the
mine
one
or
more
of
the
levers
are
pressed
in
the
teeth
crush
the
jar
the
sulphuric
acid
drops
upon
the
main
charge
and
explodes
it
do
you
follow
i
follow
you
as
far
as
the
front
door
said
the
politician
balefully
he
rose
if
the
charge
were
in
a
chair
in
the
cushion
of
an
easy
chair
say
on
the
third
floor
of
a
house
in
brooklyn
the
honorable
william
linder
sat
down
again
he
sat
heavily
the
problem
would
be
somewhat
different
of
course
it
would
be
easy
to
arrange
that
the
first
person
to
sit
down
in
the
chair
would
by
his
own
weight
blow
himself
up
but
the
first
person
might
not
be
the
right
person
you
know
do
you
still
follow
me
the
honorable
william
linder
made
a
remark
like
a
fish
now
we
have
if
you
will
forgive
my
professorial
method
continued
average
jones
a
chair
sent
to
a
gentleman
of
prominence
from
an
anonymous
source
in
this
chair
is
a
charge
of
high
explosive
and
above
it
a
glass
bulb
containing
sulphuric
acid
the
bulb
we
will
assume
is
so
as
to
resist
any
ordinary
shock
of
moving
but
when
this
gentleman
sitting
at
ease
in
his
chair
is
noticed
by
a
trombonist
placed
for
that
purpose
in
the
street
below
the
dutch
cried
the
politician
then
it
was
him
and
i
only
an
innocent
tool
interrupted
average
jones
in
his
turn
he
had
no
comprehension
of
what
he
was
doing
he
did
understand
that
the
vibration
from
his
trombone
on
one
particular
note
by
the
slide
up
the
scale
as
in
the
chorus
of
egypt
would
shiver
that
glass
and
set
off
the
charge
all
that
he
knew
was
to
play
the
trombone
and
take
his
his
pay
the
question
leaped
to
the
politician
lips
who
paid
him
a
man
named
er
arbuthnot
drawled
average
jones
linder
eyes
did
not
drop
but
a
film
seemed
to
be
drawn
over
them
you
once
knew
er
a
arbuthnot
the
thick
shoulders
quivered
a
little
her
husband
her
widower
is
in
brooklyn
shall
i
push
the
argument
any
further
to
convince
you
that
you
better
drop
out
of
the
mayoralty
race
linder
recovered
himself
a
little
what
kind
of
a
game
are
you
ringing
in
on
me
he
demanded
do
you
think
suggested
average
jones
sweetly
that
considered
as
news
this
linder
caught
the
word
out
of
his
mouth
news
he
roared
a
fake
story
ten
years
old
news
that
ai
news
it
spite
work
even
your
dirty
paper
waldemar
would
rake
that
kind
of
muck
up
after
ten
years
it
be
a
boomerang
you
have
to
put
up
a
stronger
line
of
blackmail
and
bluff
than
blackmail
is
perhaps
the
correct
word
technically
admitted
the
newspaper
owner
but
bluff
there
you
go
wrong
you
forgotten
one
thing
that
arbuthnot
arrest
and
confession
would
make
the
whole
story
news
we
stand
ready
to
arrest
arbuthnot
and
he
stands
ready
to
there
was
a
long
tense
minute
of
silence
then
what
do
you
want
the
question
was
an
admission
of
defeat
your
announcement
of
withdrawal
i
rather
print
that
than
the
arbuthnot
there
was
a
long
silence
finally
the
honorable
linder
dropped
his
hand
on
the
table
you
win
he
declared
curtly
but
you
give
me
the
benefit
in
the
announcement
of
bad
health
caused
by
the
shock
of
the
explosion
to
explain
my
quitting
waldemar
it
will
certainly
make
it
more
plausible
assented
the
newspaper
owner
with
a
smile
linder
turned
on
average
jones
did
you
dope
this
out
young
fellow
he
demanded
well
you
put
me
in
the
all
right
and
i
just
curious
enough
to
want
to
know
how
you
did
by
abstaining
returned
average
jones
cryptically
from
the
best
wine
that
ever
came
out
of
the
cosmic
club
chapter
ii
red
dot
from
his
inner
sanctum
average
jones
stared
obliquely
out
upon
the
whirl
of
fifth
avenue
warming
itself
under
a
late
march
sun
in
the
outer
offices
a
line
of
anxious
applicants
was
being
disposed
of
by
his
trained
assistants
to
the
advertising
expert
offices
had
come
that
day
but
three
cases
difficult
enough
to
be
referred
to
the
himself
two
were
rather
intricate
financial
lures
which
average
jones
was
able
to
dispose
of
by
a
mere
the
third
was
a
spiritualist
announcement
behind
which
lurked
a
shrewd
plot
to
entrap
a
senile
millionaire
into
a
marriage
with
the
medium
these
having
been
settled
the
expert
was
free
to
muse
upon
a
paragraph
which
had
appeared
in
all
the
important
new
york
morning
papers
of
the
day
before
reward
for
information
as
to
slayer
of
brindle
bulldog
rags
killed
in
office
of
malcolm
dorr
stengel
building
union
square
march
that
too
much
money
for
a
dog
decided
average
jones
particularly
one
that
has
any
bench
record
i
just
have
a
glance
into
the
slipping
on
his
coat
he
walked
briskly
down
the
avenue
and
crossing
over
to
union
square
entered
the
gloomy
old
building
which
is
the
sole
survival
of
the
days
when
the
stengel
estate
foresaw
the
upward
trend
of
business
toward
fourteenth
street
stepping
from
the
elevator
at
the
seventh
floor
he
paused
underneath
this
sign
malcolm
dorr
analytical
and
consulting
chemist
hours
to
entering
average
jones
found
a
fat
young
man
with
mild
blue
eyes
sitting
at
a
desk
mr
dorr
he
asked
yes
replied
the
fat
young
man
nervously
but
if
you
are
a
reporter
i
must
i
am
not
interrupted
the
other
i
am
an
expert
on
advertising
and
i
want
that
one
thousand
dollars
the
chemist
pushed
his
chair
back
and
rubbed
his
forehead
you
mean
you
have
have
found
out
something
not
yet
but
i
intend
dorr
stared
at
him
in
silence
you
are
very
fond
of
dogs
dorr
eh
oh
yes
yes
certainly
said
the
other
mechanically
average
jones
shot
a
sudden
glance
of
surprise
at
him
then
looked
dreamily
at
his
own
i
can
sympathize
with
you
i
have
exhibited
for
some
years
your
dog
was
perhaps
a
green
ribboner
er
oh
yes
i
believe
ah
several
of
mine
have
been
one
in
particular
took
medal
after
medal
a
beautiful
glossy
brown
bulldog
with
long
silky
ears
and
the
slender
legs
that
are
so
highly
prized
but
so
seldom
seen
nowadays
his
tail
too
had
the
truly
willoughby
curve
from
his
dam
who
was
a
famous
dorr
looked
puzzled
i
did
know
they
used
that
kind
of
dog
for
coursing
he
said
vaguely
average
jones
smiled
with
almost
affectionate
admiration
at
the
crease
along
the
knee
of
his
carefully
pressed
trousers
his
tone
when
next
he
spoke
was
that
of
a
youth
bored
with
life
any
of
his
intimates
would
have
recognized
in
it
however
the
characteristic
evidence
that
his
mind
was
ranging
swift
and
far
to
a
conclusion
mr
dorr
he
drawled
who
er
owned
your
er
dog
why
i
i
did
said
the
startled
chemist
who
gave
him
to
you
a
quite
so
was
it
that
er
friend
who
er
offered
the
reward
what
makes
you
think
that
this
to
be
frank
a
man
who
does
know
a
bulldog
from
a
is
likely
to
be
offering
a
thousand
dollars
to
avenge
the
death
of
one
and
the
minute
you
answered
my
question
as
to
whether
you
cared
for
dogs
i
knew
you
did
when
you
fell
for
a
green
ribbon
and
a
in
the
brindle
bull
class
there
no
such
class
by
the
way
i
knew
you
were
bluffing
dorr
who
er
has
been
er
threatening
your
life
the
chemist
swung
around
in
his
chair
what
do
you
know
he
demanded
nothing
i
guessing
it
a
fair
guess
that
a
reasonably
valuable
brindle
bull
is
presented
to
a
man
who
cares
nothing
for
dogs
without
some
reason
the
most
likely
reason
is
protection
is
it
in
your
case
yes
it
is
replied
the
other
after
some
hesitation
and
now
the
protection
is
gone
do
you
think
you
better
let
me
in
on
this
let
me
speak
to
my
my
legal
adviser
he
called
up
a
number
on
the
telephone
and
asked
to
be
connected
with
judge
elverson
i
may
have
to
ask
you
to
leave
the
office
for
a
moment
he
said
to
his
caller
very
well
but
if
that
is
united
states
district
attorney
roger
elverson
tell
him
that
it
is
jones
who
wants
to
know
and
remind
him
of
the
missing
letter
opium
almost
immediately
average
jones
was
called
back
from
the
hallway
whither
he
had
gone
elverson
says
to
tell
you
the
whole
thing
said
the
chemist
in
confidence
of
understood
now
who
is
it
that
wants
to
get
rid
of
you
the
paragon
pressed
meat
average
jones
became
vitally
concerned
in
removing
an
infinitesimal
speck
from
his
left
cuff
ah
he
commented
the
canned
meat
trust
what
have
you
been
doing
to
them
sold
them
a
preparation
of
my
invention
for
deodorizing
certain
used
for
manufacturing
purposes
several
months
ago
i
found
they
were
using
it
on
canned
meats
that
had
gone
bad
and
then
selling
the
would
the
meat
so
treated
be
poisonous
well
dangerous
to
any
one
eating
it
habitually
i
wrote
warning
them
that
they
must
did
they
reply
a
man
came
to
see
me
and
told
me
i
was
mistaken
he
hinted
that
if
i
thought
my
invention
was
worth
more
than
i
received
his
principals
would
be
glad
to
take
the
matter
up
with
me
shortly
after
i
heard
that
the
federal
authorities
were
going
after
the
trust
so
i
called
on
mistake
number
one
elverson
is
straight
but
his
office
is
fuller
of
leaks
than
a
that
probably
why
i
found
my
private
laboratory
reeking
of
cyanide
fumes
a
fortnight
later
remarked
dorr
dryly
i
got
to
the
outer
air
alive
but
not
much
more
a
week
later
there
was
an
explosion
in
the
laboratory
i
did
happen
to
be
there
at
the
time
the
odd
feature
of
the
explosion
was
that
i
had
any
explosive
drugs
in
the
where
is
this
laboratory
over
in
flatbush
where
i
live
or
did
live
within
a
month
after
that
a
friendly
neighbor
took
a
at
a
man
who
was
sneaking
up
behind
me
as
i
was
going
home
late
one
night
the
man
shot
too
but
missed
me
i
reported
it
to
the
police
and
they
told
me
to
be
sure
and
not
let
the
newspapers
know
then
they
forgot
average
jones
laughed
of
course
they
did
some
day
new
york
will
find
out
that
finest
police
force
in
the
world
is
the
biggest
sham
outside
the
dime
museum
except
in
the
case
of
crimes
by
the
regular
advertised
criminals
they
as
helpless
as
babies
did
you
take
any
other
precautions
oh
yes
i
reported
the
attempt
to
judge
elverson
he
sent
a
secret
service
man
over
to
live
with
me
then
i
got
a
commission
out
in
denver
when
i
came
back
about
a
month
ago
judge
elverson
gave
me
the
two
two
yes
rags
and
where
tatters
dead
by
the
same
road
as
killed
at
your
place
in
flatbush
no
right
here
in
this
average
jones
became
suddenly
very
much
worried
about
the
second
button
of
his
coat
having
satisfied
himself
of
its
stability
he
drawled
er
both
of
er
them
yes
ten
days
where
were
you
on
the
spot
that
is
i
was
here
when
tatters
got
his
death
i
had
gone
to
the
at
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
when
rags
was
why
do
you
say
poisoned
what
else
could
it
have
been
there
was
no
wound
on
either
of
the
was
there
evidence
of
poison
pathological
only
in
tatters
case
it
was
very
marked
he
was
dozing
in
a
corner
near
the
radiator
when
i
heard
him
yelp
and
saw
him
snapping
at
his
belly
he
ran
across
the
room
lay
down
and
began
licking
himself
within
fifteen
minutes
he
began
to
whine
then
he
stiffened
out
in
a
sort
of
a
spasm
it
was
like
strychnine
poisoning
before
could
get
a
veterinary
here
he
was
did
you
make
any
examination
i
analyzed
the
contents
of
his
stomach
but
did
not
obtain
positive
what
about
the
other
dog
rags
that
was
the
day
before
yesterday
we
had
just
come
over
from
flatbush
and
razs
was
nosing
around
in
the
corner
was
it
the
same
corner
where
tatters
was
attacked
yes
near
the
radiator
he
seemed
to
be
interested
in
something
there
when
i
left
the
room
i
was
gone
not
more
than
two
lock
the
door
after
you
it
has
a
special
spring
lock
which
i
had
put
on
average
jones
crossed
over
and
looked
at
the
contrivance
then
his
glance
fell
to
a
huge
keyhole
below
the
new
fastening
you
did
use
that
larger
lock
no
i
have
for
months
the
key
is
lost
i
retracing
his
steps
the
investigator
sighted
the
hole
from
the
radiator
and
shook
his
head
it
not
in
range
he
said
go
as
i
reached
the
door
on
my
return
i
heard
rags
yelp
you
may
believe
i
got
to
him
quickly
he
was
pawing
wildly
at
his
nose
i
called
up
the
nearest
veterinary
within
ten
minutes
the
convulsions
came
on
the
veterinary
was
here
when
rags
died
which
was
within
fifteen
minutes
of
the
first
spasm
he
did
believe
it
was
strychnine
said
the
attacks
were
different
whatever
it
was
i
could
find
any
trace
of
it
in
the
stomach
the
veterinary
took
the
body
away
and
made
a
complete
did
he
discover
anything
yes
the
blood
was
coagulated
and
on
the
upper
lip
he
found
a
circle
of
small
pustules
he
agreed
that
both
dogs
probably
swallowed
something
that
was
left
in
my
office
though
i
do
see
how
it
could
have
got
that
wo
do
returned
average
jones
positively
a
dog
does
cry
out
when
he
swallows
poison
unless
it
some
it
was
no
corrosive
i
examined
the
what
about
the
radiator
asked
average
jones
getting
down
on
his
knees
beside
that
antiquated
contrivance
it
seems
to
have
been
the
center
of
if
you
thinking
of
fumes
replied
the
chemist
i
tested
for
that
it
is
no
i
suppose
not
and
yet
there
the
curious
feature
that
the
fatal
influence
seems
to
have
emanated
from
the
corner
which
is
the
most
remote
from
both
windows
and
door
are
your
windows
left
open
at
night
the
windows
sometimes
the
transom
is
kept
do
they
face
any
other
windows
near
by
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
they
there
no
and
it
too
far
up
for
anything
to
come
in
from
the
average
examined
the
walls
with
attention
and
returned
to
the
big
keyhole
through
which
he
peeped
do
you
ever
chew
gum
he
asked
suddenly
the
chemist
stared
at
him
it
is
a
habit
of
mine
to
he
said
but
you
would
have
any
objection
to
my
sending
for
some
in
satisfaction
of
a
sudden
irresistible
craving
any
particular
brand
i
phone
the
corner
drug
any
sort
will
suit
thank
when
the
gum
arrived
average
jones
after
politely
offering
some
to
his
host
chewed
up
a
single
stick
thoroughly
this
he
rolled
out
to
an
extremely
tenuous
consistency
and
spread
it
deftly
across
the
unused
keyhole
which
it
completely
though
thinly
veiled
now
what
that
for
inquired
the
chemist
eying
the
improvised
closure
with
some
contempt
do
know
exactly
yet
replied
the
deviser
cheerfully
but
when
queer
and
fatal
things
happen
in
a
room
and
there
only
one
opening
it
just
as
well
to
keep
your
eye
on
that
no
matter
how
small
it
is
better
still
perhaps
if
you
shift
your
the
fat
young
chemist
pushed
his
hair
back
looked
out
of
the
window
and
then
turned
to
average
jones
the
rather
flabby
lines
of
his
face
had
abruptly
hardened
over
the
firm
contour
below
no
i
hanged
if
i
will
he
said
simply
an
amiable
grin
overspread
average
jones
face
you
got
more
nerve
than
prudence
he
observed
but
i
do
say
you
are
right
since
you
going
to
stick
to
the
ship
keep
your
eye
on
that
gum
if
it
lets
go
its
hold
wire
all
right
agreed
young
dorr
whatever
your
little
game
is
play
it
give
me
your
address
in
case
you
leave
as
i
may
do
i
am
going
to
hire
a
bureau
on
special
order
to
dig
through
the
files
of
the
local
and
neighboring
city
newspapers
for
recent
items
concerning
cases
if
our
unknown
has
devised
a
new
method
of
canicide
it
quite
possible
he
may
have
worked
it
somewhere
else
too
and
if
you
ca
be
wise
be
seemed
to
average
jones
to
have
become
a
popular
pastime
in
and
around
new
york
judging
from
the
succession
of
news
items
which
poured
in
upon
him
from
the
clipping
bureau
several
days
were
exhausted
by
false
clues
then
one
morning
there
arrived
among
other
data
an
article
from
the
bridgeport
morning
delineator
which
caused
the
to
sit
up
with
a
jerk
it
detailed
the
poisoning
of
several
dogs
under
peculiar
circumstances
three
hours
later
he
was
in
the
bustling
connecticut
city
there
he
took
carriage
for
the
house
of
curtis
fleming
whose
valuable
great
dane
dog
had
been
the
last
victim
curtis
fleming
revealed
himself
as
an
elderly
gentleman
all
grown
to
a
point
pointed
white
nose
eyes
that
were
of
irascible
gleam
and
a
most
pointed
manner
of
speech
who
are
you
he
demanded
rancidly
as
his
visitor
was
ushered
in
average
jones
recognized
the
type
he
knew
of
but
one
way
to
deal
with
it
jones
he
retorted
with
such
astounding
emphasis
that
the
monosyllable
fairly
exploded
in
the
other
face
well
well
well
said
the
elder
man
his
aspect
suddenly
mollified
do

kind
of
a

are
you

what
do
you

into
a

in
fifteen
minutes
and

cried
the
old
man
bringing
his

down
on

knee
if
i
see
how
the
poison

him
for
he
was
muzzled
to
the

sir
muzzled
then

drawled
the
young

to
go
the

way
in
the
last
all
in
this
locality
yes
all
on
golden
any

suspicions
certainly
young

certainly
look
at

took
the
smutted
newspaper
proof
which
his

extended
and
read
of
the

neighborhood
are
earnestly
cautioned
against
unguarded
handling

about

or
outbuildings
until
further
notice
danger
when

it

it
was
a
case
of

of
mine
frame
house
on
the
next
corner
with
how
long
ago
about
a
all
the
dogs
you
speak
of
died
since
then
did
he
give
any
explanation
of
the
advertisement
no
acted
when
he
brought
it
to
the
office
the
business
manager
said
would
sign
his
name
to
the
thing
would
say
anything
about
it
begged
the
manager
to
let
him
have
the
weather
reports
in
advance
every
day
the
manager
put
the
advertisement
in
type
decided
not
to
it
and
returned
the
reports
eh
average
jones
mused
a
moment
how
long
was
the
ad
to
run
until
the
first
hard
has
there
er
been
a
er
frost
since
drawled
average
jones
who
is
this
moseley
do
know
much
about
him
scientific
experimenter
of
some
kind
i
believe
very
exclusive
added
curtis
fleming
with
a
grin
never
sociated
with
any
of
us
neighbors
rent
on
the
nail
though
insane
too
i
think
writes
letters
to
himself
with
nothing
in
how
that
inquired
average
jones
the
other
took
an
envelope
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
over
it
got
enclosed
by
mistake
with
the
copy
for
the
advertisement
the
handwriting
on
the
envelope
is
his
own
look
a
glance
had
shown
average
jones
that
the
letter
had
been
mailed
in
new
york
on
march
he
took
out
the
enclosure
it
was
a
small
slip
of
paper
the
date
was
stamped
on
with
a
rubber
stamp
there
was
no
writing
of
any
kind
near
the
center
of
the
sheet
were
three
dots
they
seemed
to
have
been
made
with
red
ink
you
sure
the
address
is
in
professor
moseley
writing
i
swear
to
it
does
follow
that
he
mailed
it
to
himself
in
fact
i
should
judge
that
it
was
sent
by
someone
who
was
particularly
anxious
not
to
have
any
specimen
of
his
handwriting
lying
about
for
identification
perhaps
what
your
interest
in
all
this
anyway
my
mysterious
young
friend
two
dogs
in
new
york
poisoned
in
something
the
same
way
as
well
i
got
my
man
he
confessed
echoed
average
jones
practically
i
kept
the
point
of
the
story
to
the
last
professor
moseley
committed
suicide
this
if
curtis
fleming
had
designed
to
make
an
impression
on
his
visitor
his
ambition
was
fulfilled
average
jones
got
to
his
feet
slowly
walked
over
to
the
window
returned
picked
up
the
strange
proof
with
its
message
of
suggested
peril
studied
it
returned
to
the
window
and
stared
out
into
the
day
cut
his
throat
about
nine
this
morning
pursued
the
other
dead
when
they
found
do
you
mind
not
talking
to
me
for
a
minute
said
average
jones
curtly
told
to
hold
my
tongue
in
my
own
house
by
uninvited
stripling
cackled
the
other
you
re
a
singular
young
man
have
it
your
own
after
a
five
minutes
silence
the
visitor
turned
from
the
window
and
spoke
there
has
been
a
deadly
danger
loose
about
here
for
which
professor
moseley
felt
himself
responsible
he
has
killed
himself
why
because
i
was
on
his
trail
declared
curtis
fleming
afraid
to
face
nonsense
i
believe
some
human
being
has
been
killed
by
this
thing
whatever
it
may
be
and
that
the
horror
of
it
drove
moseley
to
prove
give
me
a
morning
his
host
handed
him
the
current
issue
of
the
delineator
average
jones
studied
the
local
page
where
galvin
alley
he
asked
presently
two
short
blocks
from
in
the
golden
hill
section
read
curtis
fleming
took
the
paper
his
eyes
were
directed
to
a
paragraph
telling
of
the
death
of
an
italian
child
living
in
galvin
alley
cause
convulsions
by
jove
said
he
somewhat
awed
you
can
reason
young
i
got
to
reason
a
lot
further
if
i
to
get
anywhere
in
this
affair
said
average
jones
with
conviction
do
you
care
to
come
to
galvin
alley
with
me
together
they
went
down
the
hill
to
a
poor
little
house
marked
by
white
crepe
the
occupants
were
italians
who
spoke
some
english
they
said
that
pietro
had
been
playing
around
a
woodpile
the
afternoon
before
when
he
was
taken
sick
and
came
home
staggering
the
doctor
could
do
nothing
the
little
one
passed
from
spasm
into
spasm
and
died
in
an
hour
was
there
a
mark
like
a
ring
anywhere
on
the
hand
or
face
asked
average
jones
the
dead
child
father
looked
surprised
that
he
said
was
what
the
strange
gentleman
who
had
come
that
very
morning
asked
a
queer
bent
little
gentlemen
very
bald
and
with
big
who
was
kind
and
wept
with
them
and
gave
them
money
to
bury
the
moseley
by
the
lord
harry
exclaimed
curtis
fleming
but
what
was
the
average
jones
shook
his
head
too
early
to
do
more
than
guess
will
you
take
me
to
professor
moseley
place
the
old
house
stood
with
a
conservatory
on
one
wing
in
the
front
room
they
found
the
recluse
body
decently
disposed
with
an
undertaker
assistant
in
charge
from
the
greenhouse
came
a
subdued
hissing
what
that
asked
jones
fumigating
the
conservatory
there
was
a
note
found
near
the
body
insisting
on
its
being
done
safety
it
said
so
i
ordered
it
looked
you
in
charge
then
it
my
house
and
there
are
no
relatives
so
far
as
i
know
come
and
look
at
his
papers
you
wo
find
in
the
desk
was
a
heap
of
undecipherable
matter
interspersed
with
dates
apparently
bearing
upon
scientific
experiments
a
package
of
letters
from
the
denny
research
laboratories
of
louis
mentioning
enclosure
of
checks
and
three
envelopes
bearing
new
york
postmarks
of
dates
respectively
march
march
and
march
each
contained
a
sheet
of
paper
similar
to
that
which
curtis
fleming
had
shown
to
average
jones
the
one
of
earliest
date
bore
two
red
dots
the
second
three
red
dots
and
the
third
two
all
the
envelopes
were
endorsed
in
professor
handwriting
the
first
with
the
one
word
the
second
writing
was
held
for
warmer
the
last
was
inscribed
one
in
poor
of
these
average
jones
made
careful
note
as
well
as
of
the
laboratory
address
by
this
time
the
hissing
of
the
fumigating
apparatus
had
ceased
the
two
men
went
to
the
conservatory
and
gazed
in
upon
a
ruin
of
limp
leaves
and
flaccid
petals
killed
by
the
powerful
gases
suddenly
with
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
the
investigator
stooped
and
lifted
from
the
floor
a
marvel
of
ermine
body
and
pale
green
wings
the
moth
spreading
nearly
a
foot
was
quite
dead
here
the
mate
sir
said
the
fumigating
expert
handing
him
another
specimen
a
trifle
smaller
the
place
was
crowded
with
all
kinds
of
pretty
ones
all
gone
where
the
good
bugs
go
average
jones
took
the
pair
of
moths
to
the
desk
measured
them
and
laid
them
carefully
away
in
a
drawer
the
rest
must
wait
he
said
i
have
to
send
a
with
the
interested
curtis
fleming
in
attendance
he
went
to
the
telegraph
office
where
he
wrote

a
dispatch
mr

said
the
operator
there
a

took
the

read
found

that
unheard
of

next
number
of
the
national
science
weekly
and
in
coming
issues
of
the
new
york
evening
he
handed
out
a
rough
draft
of
this
advertisement
for
sale
two
largest
known
specimens
of
tropaea
luna
unmounted
respectively
and
inches
spread
also
various
other
specimens
from
collection
of
late
gerald
moseley
of
write
for
particulars
jones
room
astor
court
temple
new
what
about
further
danger
here
inquired
fleming
as
average
jones
bade
him
would
we
better
run
that
warning
of
poor
moseley
after
all
for
reply
jones
pointed
out
the
window
a
late
season
whirl
of
snow
enveloped
the
streets
i
see
said
the
old
man
the
frost
well
mr
mysterious
jones
i
do
know
what
you
up
to
but
you
given
me
an
interesting
day
let
me
know
what
comes
of
on
the
train
back
to
new
york
average
jones
wrote
two
letters
one
was
to
the
denny
research
laboratories
in
louis
the
other
to
the
department
of
agriculture
at
washington
on
the
following
morning
he
went
to
dorr
office
that
young
chemist
was
in
a
recalcitrant
frame
of
mind
i
done
about
ten
dollars
worth
of
fumigating
and
a
hundred
worth
of
damage
he
said
and
now
i
like
to
have
a
missouri
sign
in
other
words
i
want
to
be
shown
what
did
some
skunk
want
to
kill
my
dogs
for
he
but
they
dead
are
they
what
kind
of
an
accident
the
kind
in
which
the
innocent
bystander
gets
the
worst
of
it
the
one
it
was
meant
me
certainly
you
probably
have
got
it
if
the
dog
the
speaker
examined
the
keyhole
then
walked
over
to
the
radiator
and
looked
over
under
and
through
it
minutely
nothing
there
he
observed
and
after
extending
his
examination
to
the
windows
and
desk
added
i
guess
we
might
have
spared
the
fumigation
however
the
safest
side
is
the
what
is
it
some
new
game
in
projective
germs
demanded
the
chemist
oh
disinfectants
will
kill
other
things
besides
germs
returned
average
jones
luna
moths
for
instance
wait
a
few
days
and
i
have
some
mail
to
show
you
on
that
subject
in
the
meantime
have
a
plumber
solder
up
that
keyhole
so
tight
that
nothing
short
of
dynamite
can
get
through
collectors
of
lepidoptera
rose
in
shoals
to
the
printed
offer
of
luna
moths
measuring
ten
and
eleven
inches
across
the
wings
letters
came
in
by
every
mail
responding
variously
with
fervor
suspicion
yearning
eagerness
and
bitter
skepticism
to
average
jones
advertisement
all
of
these
he
put
aside
except
such
as
bore
a
new
york
postmark
and
each
day
he
compared
the
new
names
signed
to
the
new
york
letters
with
the
directory
of
occupants
of
the
stengel
building
less
than
a
week
after
the
luna
moth
advertisement
appeared
average
jones
walked
into
malcolm
dorr
office
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
do
you
know
a
man
named
marcus
ross
he
asked
the
chemist
never
heard
of
marcus
ross
is
interested
not
only
in
luna
moths
but
in
the
rest
of
the
moseley
collection
he
writes
from
the
delamater
apartments
where
he
lives
to
tell
me
so
also
he
has
an
office
in
this
building
likewise
he
works
frequently
at
night
finally
he
is
one
of
the
confidential
lobbyists
of
the
paragon
pressed
meat
company
do
you
see
i
begin
replied
young
dorr
it
would
be
very
easy
for
ross
whose
office
is
on
the
floor
above
to
stop
at
this
door
on
his
way
after
quitting
work
late
at
night
when
the
elevator
had
stopped
running
and
let
us
say
peep
through
the
malcolm
dorr
got
up
and
stretched
himself
slowly
the
sharp
clean
lines
of
his
face
suddenly
stood
out
again
under
the
creasy
flesh
i
do
know
what
you
going
to
do
to
ross
he
said
but
i
want
to
see
him
i
not
going
to
do
anything
to
him
returned
average
jones
because
in
the
first
place
i
suspect
that
he
is
far
far
away
having
noted
doubtless
the
plugged
keyhole
and
suffered
a
crisis
of
the
nerves
strange
how
nervous
your
scientific
murderer
is
anyway
ross
is
only
an
agent
i
going
to
aim
as
how
well
i
expect
to
do
three
things
first
i
expect
to
scare
a
peaceful
but
murderous
trust
multimillionaire
almost
out
of
his
senses
second
i
expect
to
dispatch
a
costly
yacht
to
unknown
seas
and
third
i
expect
to
raise
the
street
selling
price
of
the
evening
journals
temporarily
about
one
thousand
per
cent
what
the
answer
the
answer
is
papers
new
york
that
afternoon
saw
something
new
in
advertising
that
it
really
was
advertising
was
shown
by
the
sign
large
and
plain
in
both
the
papers
which
carried
it
the
favored
journals
were
the
only
two
which
indulged
in
fudge
editions
that
is
editions
with
glaring
inserts
of
special
news
on
the
front
page
of
each
stretching
narrowly
across
three
columns
was
a
device
showing
a
tiny
mapped
outline
in
black
marked
bridgeport
and
a
large
skeleton
draft
of
manhattan
island
showing
the
principal
streets
from
the
connecticut
city
downward
ran
a
line
of
dots
in
red
the
dots
entered
new
york
from
the
north
passed
down
fourth
avenue
to
the
south
side
of
union
square
turned
west
and
terminated
beneath
this
map
was
the
legend
also
in
red
watch
the
line
advance
in
later
editions
it
was
the
first
time
in
the
records
of
journalism
that
the
fudge
device
had
been
used
in
advertising
great
was
the
rejoicing
of
the
newsies
when
public
curiosity
made
a
run
upon
these
papers
greater
it
grew
when
the
afternoon
edition
appeared
and
with
their
keen
business
instinct
the
urchins
saw
that
they
could
run
the
price
upward
which
they
promptly
did
in
some
cases
even
to
a
nickel
this
edition
carried
the
same
fudge
advertisement
but
now
the
red
dots
crossed
over
to
fifth
avenue
and
turned
northward
as
far
as
street
the
inscription
was
upward
and
onward
see
next
extra
for
the
night
extra
people
paid
five
ten
even
fifteen
cents
rumor
ran
wild
other
papers
even
look
the
matter
up
as
news
and
commented
upon
the
meaning
of
the
extraordinary
advertisement
this
time
the
line
went
as
far
up
fifth
ave
title
as
fiftieth
street
and
the
legend
was
ominous
when
i
turn
i
strike
that
was
all
that
evening
the
dotted
line
did
not
turn
keen
as
newspaper
conjecture
is
it
failed
to
connect
the
maps
with
the
fame
of
which
the
city
was
raging
with
an
item
of
shipping
news
printed
in
the
evening
papers
of
the
following
day
cleared
for
south
american
ports
steam
yacht
electra
new
york
owner
john
colwell
and
not
until
the
following
morning
did
the
papers
announce
that
president
colwell
of
the
canned
meat
trust
having
been
ordered
by
his
physician
on
a
long
sea
voyage
to
refurbish
his
depleted
nerves
after
closing
his
house
on
west
street
had
sailed
in
his
own
yacht
the
same
issue
carried
a
few
lines
about
the
freak
which
had
so
sensationally
blazed
and
so
suddenly
waned
from
the
the
opinion
was
offered
that
they
represented
the
exploitation
of
some
new
brand
of
whisky
which
would
announce
itself
later
but
that
announcement
never
came
and
president
colwell
sailed
to
far
seas
and
curtis
fleming
came
to
new
york
keen
for
explanations
for
he
too
had
seen
the
fudge
and
marveled
hence
average
jones
had
him
together
with
young
dorr
at
a
private
room
luncheon
at
the
cosmic
club
where
he
offered
an
explanation
and
elucidation
the
whole
affair
he
said
was
a
problem
in
the
connecting
up
of
loose
ends
at
the
new
york
terminus
we
had
two
deaths
in
the
office
of
a
man
with
powerful
and
subtle
enemies
that
office
being
practically
sealed
against
intrusion
except
for
a
very
large
keyhole
some
deadly
thing
is
introduced
through
that
keyhole
so
much
is
practically
proven
by
the
breaking
out
of
the
chewing
gum
with
which
i
coated
it
probably
the
scheme
was
carried
out
in
the
evening
when
the
building
was
nearly
deserted
the
killing
influence
reaches
a
corner
far
out
of
the
direct
line
of
the
keyhole
being
near
the
radiator
that
corner
represents
the
attraction
of
warmth
therefore
the
invading
force
was
some
sentient
dorr
shuddered
some
kind
of
venomous
snake
he
surmised
not
a
bad
guess
but
a
snake
however
small
would
have
been
instantly
noticed
by
the
dogs
now
let
look
at
the
bridgeport
end
here
again
we
have
a
deadly
influence
loosed
this
time
by
accident
a
scientific
experimentalist
is
the
innocent
cause
of
the
disaster
here
too
the
peril
is
somewhat
dependent
upon
warmth
since
we
know
from
professor
moseley
agonized
eagerness
for
a
frost
that
cold
weather
would
have
put
an
end
to
it
the
cold
weather
fails
to
come
dogs
are
killed
finally
a
child
falls
victim
and
on
that
child
is
found
a
circular
mark
similar
to
the
mark
on
dorr
dog
lip
you
see
the
striking
points
of
analogy
do
you
mean
us
to
believe
poor
old
moseley
a
murderer
demanded
curtis
fleming
far
from
it
at
worst
an
unhappy
victim
of
his
own
carelessness
in
loosing
a
peril
upon
his
neighborhood
you
forgetting
a
connecting
link
the
secretive
communications
from
new
york
city
addressed
by
moseley
to
himself
on
behalf
of
some
customer
who
ordered
simply
by
a
code
of
ink
dots
he
was
the
man
i
had
to
find
the
giant
luna
moths
helped
to
do
i
do
see
where
they
come
in
at
all
declared
dorr
bluntly
a
moth
a
foot
wide
could
crawl
through
a
no
nor
do
any
damage
if
it
did
the
luna
is
as
harmless
as
it
is
lovely
in
this
case
the
moths
were
active
agents
they
were
important
only
as
clues
and
bait
their
enormous
size
showed
professor
moseley
line
of
work
the
selective
breeding
of
certain
forms
of
life
to
two
or
three
times
the
normal
proportions
very
well
i
had
to
ascertain
some
creature
which
if
magnified
several
times
would
be
deadly
and
which
would
still
be
capable
of
entering
a
large
keyhole
having
determined
that
you
found
what
it
was
cried
dorr
one
moment
having
determined
that
i
had
still
to
get
in
touch
with
professor
moseley
mysterious
new
york
correspondent
i
figured
that
he
must
be
interested
in
professor
moseley
particular
branch
of
research
or
he
never
could
have
devised
his
murderous
scheme
so
i
constructed
the
luna
moth
advertisement
to
draw
him
and
when
i
got
a
reply
from
ross
who
is
a
of
dorr
the
chain
was
complete
now
you
see
where
the
luna
moths
were
useful
if
i
had
advertised
instead
of
them
the
lathrodectus
he
might
have
suspected
and
refrained
from
what
the
lathrodectus
demanded
both
the
hearers
at
once
for
answer
average
jones
took
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
read
bureau
of
entomology
department
of
agriculture
washington
april
jones
astor
court
temple
new
york
city
dear
sir
replying
to
your
letter
of
inquiry
the
only
insect
answering
your
specifications
is
a
small
spider
lathrodectus
mactans
sometimes
popularly
called
the
red
dot
from
a
bright
red
mark
upon
the
back
rare
cases
are
known
where
death
has
been
caused
by
the
bite
of
this
insect
fortunately
its
fangs
are
so
weak
that
they
can
penetrate
only
very
tender
skin
otherwise
death
from
its
bite
would
be
more
common
as
the
venom
drop
for
drop
is
perhaps
the
most
virulent
known
to
science
this
bureau
knows
nothing
of
any
experiments
in
breeding
the
lathrodectus
for
size
your
surmise
that
specimens
of
two
or
three
times
the
normal
size
would
be
dangerous
to
life
is
undoubtedly
correct
and
selected
breeding
to
that
end
should
be
conducted
only
under
adequate
scientific
safeguards
a
lathrodectus
mactans
with
fangs
large
enough
to
penetrate
the
skin
of
the
hand
and
a
double
or
triple
supply
of
venom
would
be
perhaps
more
deadly
than
a
cobra
the
symptoms
of
poisoning
by
this
species
are
spasms
similar
to
those
of
trismus
and
agonizing
general
pains
there
are
no
local
symptoms
except
in
some
cases
a
circle
of
small
pustules
about
the
bitten
spot
commercially
the
lathrodectus
has
value
in
that
the
poison
is
used
in
certain
affections
of
the
heart
for
details
i
would
refer
you
to
the
denny
laboratories
of
louis
which
are
purchasers
of
the
venom
the
species
is
very
susceptible
to
cold
and
would
hardly
survive
a
severe
frost
it
frequents
woodpiles
and
outhouses
yours
truly
howard
chief
of
bureau
then
ross
was
sneaking
down
here
at
night
and
putting
the
spiders
which
he
had
got
from
professor
moseley
through
my
keyhole
in
the
hope
that
sooner
or
later
one
of
them
would
get
me
said
dorr
a
very
reasonable
expectation
too
vide
the
dogs
returned
average
jones
and
now
said
curtis
fleming
will
some
one
kindly
explain
to
me
what
this
ross
fiend
had
against
our
friend
dorr
nothing
replied
average
jones
nothing
was
he
coursing
with
spiders
merely
for
sport
oh
no
you
see
dorr
was
interfering
with
the
machinery
of
one
of
our
ruling
institutions
the
canned
meat
trust
he
possessed
information
which
would
have
indicted
all
the
officials
therefore
it
was
desirable
even
essential
that
he
should
be
removed
from
the
pathway
of
nonsense
socialistic
nonsense
snapped
curtis
fleming
trusts
may
be
unprincipled
but
they
do
commit
individual
do
they
returned
average
jones
smiling
amiably
at
his
own
did
you
ever
hear
of
adel
meyer
little
corset
steel
which
he
invented
to
stick
in
the
customs
scales
and
rob
the
government
for
the
profit
of
his
syrup
trust
or
of
the
individual
oil
refineries
which
mysteriously
disappeared
in
fire
and
smoke
at
a
time
when
they
became
annoying
to
the
combination
oil
trust
or
of
the
traction
trust
two
plots
to
murder
prosecutor
henry
in
san
francisco
i
just
mentioning
a
few
cases
from
memory
why
when
a
criminal
trust
faces
only
loss
it
will
commit
forgery
theft
or
arson
when
it
faces
jail
it
will
commit
murder
just
as
determinedly
you
know
as
for
the
case
of
dorr
and
he
proceeded
to
detail
the
various
attempts
on
the
young
chemist
life
but
why
so
roundabout
a
method
asked
dorr
skeptically
well
they
tried
the
ordinary
methods
of
murder
on
you
through
agents
that
did
work
it
was
up
to
the
trust
to
put
one
of
its
own
confidential
men
on
it
ross
is
an
amateur
entomologist
he
devised
a
means
that
looked
to
be
pretty
safe
and
in
the
long
run
and
would
have
been
but
for
your
skill
young
jones
declared
curtis
fleming
with
emphasis
do
forget
the
fortunate
coincidences
replied
average
jones
modestly
they
about
half
of
it
in
fact
detective
work
for
all
that
is
said
on
the
other
side
is
mostly
the
ability
to
recognize
and
connect
coincidences
the
coincidence
of
the
escape
of
the
red
dots
from
professor
moseley
breeding
cages
the
coincidence
of
the
death
of
the
dogs
on
golden
hill
followed
by
the
death
of
the
child
the
coincidence
of
poor
moseley
having
left
the
red
dot
letters
on
the
desk
instead
of
destroying
them
the
coincidence
of
dorr
dogs
being
bitten
when
it
might
easily
have
been
himself
had
he
gone
to
turn
on
the
radiator
and
disturbed
the
savage
little
spider
and
the
chief
coincidence
of
your
having
become
interested
in
the
advertisement
which
judge
elverson
had
me
insert
really
more
to
scare
off
further
attempts
than
anything
else
put
in
dorr
what
became
of
the
spiders
that
were
slipped
through
my
keyhole
anyway
two
of
them
as
you
know
were
probably
killed
by
the
dogs
the
others
may
well
have
died
of
cold
at
night
when
the
heat
was
off
and
the
windows
open
the
cleaning
woman
would
have
been
likely
to
notice
them
when
she
swept
the
bodies
out
and
sooner
or
later
if
ross
had
continued
to
insert
red
dots
through
the
keyhole
one
of
them
would
have
bitten
you
dorr
and
the
canned
meat
trust
would
have
gone
on
its
way
well
you
certainly
saved
my
life
declared
dorr
and
it
a
case
of
sheer
force
of
average
jones
shook
his
head
you
might
give
some
of
the
credit
to
providence
he
said
just
one
little
event
would
have
meant
the
saving
of
the
italian
child
and
of
professor
moseley
and
the
death
of
yourself
instead
of
the
other

not

enough
said
average

laying
aside
a
sheet
of
paper
upon
which
was
pasted
a
newspaper
clipping
we
ca
afford

the
confidential

rubbed
his
high
pale
forehead
indeterminately
but
five
thousand
dollars
jones
he
protested
would
pay
a
year
office
rent
you
thinking
true
nevertheless
i
ca
see
the
missing
hoff
as
a
sound
professional
so
you
think
it
would
be
impossible
to
find
him
now
why
should
i
think
any
such
absurd
thing
i
think
if
you
choose
that
he
would
be
worth
the
amount
when
found
to
the
ad
says
different
simpson
raised
the
paper
and
read
five
thousand
dollars
the
aforesaid
sum
will
be
paid
without
question
to
anyone
furnishing
information
which
leads
to
the
discovery
of
roderick
hoff
years
old
who
left
his
home
in
toledo
on
april
communicate
with
conrad
hoff
toledo
surely
doctor
hoff
is
good
for
the
oh
he
good
for
millions
thanks
to
his
much
advertised
quack
the
point
is
from
what
i
can
discover
roderick
hoff
is
worth
retrieving
at
any
price
above
one
was
the
information
about
him
that
you
wished
in
the
telegram
asked
the
confidential
clerk
yes
all
i
wanted
thanks
for
looking
after
it
have
the
toledo
reporter
who
sent
it
forward
his
bill
and
if
the
old
inventor
been
haunted
by
disembodied
voices
comes
again
bring
him
to
yes
sir
said
simpson
going
out
left
to
himself
average
jones
again
ran
over
the
dispatches
conveying
the
information
as
to
the
lost
toledo
youth
they
had
given
a
fairly
complete
sketch
of
young
hoff
life
and
character
at
it
appeared
roderick
hoff
had
achieved
a
career
emerging
by
the
propulsive
method
from
college
in
the
first
term
of
his
freshman
year
he
had
taken
a
course
in
the
cigarette
ward
of
a
polite
retreat
for
nervous
wrecks
he
had
subsequently
endured
two
suits
had
broken
the
state
automobile
record
for
number
of
speed
violation
arrests
had
been
buncoed
badgered
paneled
blackmailed
and
out
of
sums
varying
between
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
dollars
and
now
in
the
year
of
grace
was
the
horror
of
the
pulpit
and
the
delight
of
the
press
of
the
city
which
he
called
his
home
for
the
rest
he
was
a
large
mild
pulpy
individual
with
a
fixed
delusion
that
the
human
organism
can
absorb
a
quart
of
alcoholic
miscellany
per
day
and
be
none
the
worse
for
it
the
major
premise
of
his
proposition
was
perfectly
correct
he
proved
it
daily
the
minor
premise
was
an
error
bets
were
even
in
the
toledo
clubs
as
to
whether
delirium
tremens
or
paresis
would
win
the
event
around
young
hoff
of
a
brain
with
his
tastes
the
income
of
thousand
dollars
per
annum
which
his
father
allowed
him
from
the
profits
of
dr
proved
sadly
insufficient
to
his
needs
he
mentioned
this
fact
to
his
father
so
average
jones
information
ran
early
in
april
and
suggested
an
increase
only
to
be
refused
with
some
acerbity
oh
very
well
said
he
i
go
and
make
it
the
amazement
inspired
in
doctor
hoff
mind
by
this
pronouncement
was
augmented
in
the
next
few
days
by
the
fact
that
roderick
was
very
busy
about
town
in
his
and
was
changed
to
vivid
alarm
immediately
thereafter
by
the
young

through

of
the

this
advertisement
it
was
upon
the
practical
merits
of
which
average

and
his
confidential
clerk
had
differed
if
there
were
any
chance
of
sport
in
it
mused
average

i
go
in
but
to
follow
the
trail
of
a
spurious
young
sport
from
to
brothel
and
from
brothel
to
gambling
hell
he
shook
his
head
not
good
enough
he
repeated
simpson

appeared
at
the
door
his
blond
forehead
was
wrinkled
with
excitement
doctor

is
here

i
told
him
you
could
see
him
but
he
would
take
no

he
was
recommended
to
you
by
a
former
following
the

burst
into

a
gross
old

up

to

analysis
of

inspired
average

with
a
profound
contempt
and
dislike
for
the
cruelest
of
all
forms
of
swindling
medical
quackery
and
this
swollen

looked
a
particularly
offensive

of

did
you

it

out
from

a
personality
resolute
forceful
and
quietly
alert
it
was
apparently
belied
by
the
hesitant
drawl
which
as
all
who
had
ever
seen

awakened

how

the

spread

a

the

got
there
just
after

upon

two

him
dassent
say
no
more
from
a

average
jones
examined
the
wrapper
it
was
postmarked
cincinnati
he
next
smoothed
out
the
creased
silk
and
studied
minutely
the
blotches
which
were
heaviest
about
the
left
breast
and
shoulder
to
the
surprise
of
doctor
hoff
the
young
man
glance
roved
the
big
desk
before
him
settling
with
satisfaction
upon
a
for
moistening
stamps
applying
this
to
one
of
the
spots
on
the

he
rubbed
the
wetted
portion
vigorously
on
a
sheet
of
paper
which
lay
near
at
hand
his
lips
pursed
he
whistled
very
softly
and
meditatively
he
scratched
his
chin
with
a
slow
movement
is
that
all
he
shot
out
suddenly
at
the
older
man
all
ai
it
enough

tell
you
an
you

average
jones
directed
a
dreamy
smile
toward
a
far
comer
of
the
room
i
do
see
anything
so
far
he
observed
to
indicate
that
your
son
is
not
alive
and
well
at
this
doctor
hoff
struck
his
fist
down
heavily
on
the
desk
what
this
you
givin
me
ca
you

look
at
that
note
there
an

said
the
mildly
moreover
not

what
is
it
then
that
beside
the
question
dried
blood
rubs
off
a
faint
buff
he
picked
up
the
sheet
of
paper
from
his
desk
a
deep
brownish
streak
showed
where
he
had
applied
the
moistened
cloth
it
the
rawest
kind
of
a
blind
why
the
idiot
who
sent
the
shirt
did
even
have
the
sense
to
fake
bullet
holes
enough
to
make
one
lose
all
interest
in
the

he
added
disgustedly
doctor
hoff
began
tugging
at
his
do
do
nothing
like
that
he
pleaded
come
with
me
to
cincinnati
if
he
ai
dead
kidnapped
him
for
a
then
cincinnati
is
the
last
place
on
the
map
to
look
because
where
they
want
you
to
think
he
is
but
it
does
look
like
a
case
of
ransom
to
me
let
see
was
he
particularly
drunk
the
day
before
he
disappeared
no
he
was
unusually
sober
maybe
suggested
the
other
yes
he
was
been
sober
for
a
week
an
he
was
studyin
ah
studying
what
spanish
eh
ever
exhibit
any
interest
in
foreign
tongues
before
not
enough
to
get
him
through
one
term
in
college
returned
the
other
grimly
how
did
you
know
about
his
studying
seen
the
perfessor
in
the
some
one
you
knew
no
i
asked
him
roddy
was
sore
because
i
found
out
what
he
was
up
upon
that
point
average
jones
meditated
a
moment
did
you
see
this
spanish
professor
again
he
inquired
presently
now
that
you
speak
of
it
i
did
see
him
but
the
can
you
leave
for
toledo
on
train
you
goin
to
take
the
case
then
the
quack
clawed
nervously
at
his
professional
white
whiskers
what
your
terms
he
demanded
that
i
to
have
full
control
and
that
you
to
take
orders
and
not
give
doctor
hoff
swallowed
that
with
a
gulp
you
on
he
said
finally
on
the
train
doctor
hoff
regaled
his
companion
with
a
strictly
paternal
view
of
his
son
character
and
pursuits
as
he
knew
them
this
served
at
least
to
enlarge
his
auditor
ideas
as
to
the
average
american
father
vast
and
profound
ignorance
of
the
life
habits
manners
and
customs
of
that
common
but
variable
species
the
offspring
beyond
this
it
had
little
value
average
jones
gave
its
author
a
few
specific
instructions
as
to
minor
lines
of
home
investigation
and
retired
to
map
out
a
tentative
campaign
his
first
call
on
arriving
at
toledo
was
at
the
business
office
of
the
daily
saw
in
which
he
inserted
the
following
paragraph
on
a
order
wanted
instructor
in
spanish
one
with
recent
experience
preferred
apply
between
and
doctor
hoff
fairfield
avenue
thence
he
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
den
of
the
city
editor
to
whom
he
stated
his
errand
openly
being
too
wise
in
his
day
and
generation
to
attempt
concealment
or
evasion
with
a
newspaper
man
from
whom
he
wanted
information
the
city
editor
obligingly
furnished
further
details
regarding
rickey
hoff
as
he
called
the
young
man
which
while
differing
in
important
respects
from
doctor
hoff
bore
the
of
superior
accuracy
the
worst
of
it
is
said
the
newspaper
man
that
there
are
elements
of
decency
about
the
young
cub
if
he
keep
sober
he
wo
go
into
the
old
boy
business
because
he
hates
it
says
it
all
rot
and
lies
he
dead
right
of
course
but
there
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
so
he
just
fights
booze
better
make
a
few
inquiries
at
silent
what
that
quiet
little
bar
kept
by
a
talkative
swede
hoff
hung
out
there
a
lot
charley
even
had
a
room
fixed
up
for
him
to
lay
off
in
when
he
was
too
pickled
to
go
would
er
young
hoff
er
perhaps
keep
a
few
er
extra
clothes
there
asked
average
jones
seemingly
struggling
with
a
yawn
the
city
editor
stared
oh
i
dare
say
he
used
to
end
his
sprees
pretty
much
mussed
that
would
perhaps
explain
where
the
shirt
came
from
murmured
the
much
obliged
for
the
suggestion
i
just
step
silent
charley
he
found
ready
even
eager
to
talk
yes
rickey
hoff
had
been
in
his
place
right
along
drunk
no
not
even
drinking
much
lately
two
other
gentlemen
had
met
him
there
quite
often
they
sat
in
the
back
room
and
talked
no
neither
of
them
was
spanish
one
was
big
and
and
wore
a
silk
hat
they
called
him
a
swell
dresser
the
other
man
drank
gin
and
a
lot
of
it
his
name
was
fred
he
was
very
tanned
one
day
there
had
been
a
hot
discussion
over
a
sheet
of
paper
that
lay
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
three
men
in
the
back
room
rickey
had
called
a
messenger
boy
and
sent
him
out
for
a
geography
i
told
you
there
was
any
such
thing
there
the
heard
him
say
triumphantly
when
the
geography
arrived
then
fred
replied
to
with
you
and
your
schoolbook
i
tell
you
i
waded
across
the
colonel
smoothed
things
over
and
it
ended
in
a
magnum
of
champagne
being
ordered
for
which
the
colonel
paid
asked
average
jones
why
yes
he
did
assented
the
saloon
man
he
said
it
a
go
then
here
luck
to
us
he
was
a
good
spender
the
and
you
have
seen
any
of
them
since
i
suppose
nary
a
on
his
return
to
the
hoff
mansion
the
investigator
found
the
head
thereof
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
say
i
found
out
something
he
cried
roddy
gone
to
where
did
you
find
that
out
asked
average
jones
with
a
smile
i
been
going
through
his
papers
like
you
told
me
he
been
outfitting
for
a
trip
bought
lots
of
truck
the
last
few
days
and
i
found
the
duplicate
that
come
in
the
packages
there
stubs
for
a
steamer
rug
and
for
a
dope
for
seasickness
and
for
a
compass
he
concluded
triumphantly
compass
eh
observed
average
jones
thoughtfully
ship
compass
is
good
enough
for
most
of
us
going
to
europe
anything
else
lot
of
what
kind
of
clothes
cheap
stuff
mostly
khaki
neglyjee
shirts
and
not
much
suggestion
of
europe
there
what
more
doctor
hoff
consulted
a
list
colored
that
looks
like
desert
aneroid
mountain
permanganate
of
potash
snake
country
commented
the
other
patent
average
jones
leaned
forward
how
big
do
know
cost
twenty
little
one
then
that
means
about
three
people
taken
with
the
compass
it
means
a
trip
on
salt
small
boat
nothin
retorted
the
other
his
doctor
met
me
this
morning
an
told
me
roddy
had
sent
for
him
and
ast
him
a
lot
of
questions
about
eatin
aboard
ship
and
which
way
to
have
his
berth
made
up
and
all
a
trip
following
a
sea
trip
then
what
else
have
you
found
nothin
much
mosquito
nettin
pills
surgeon
plaster
and
odds
and
ends
of
let
me
see
the
drug
he
ran
his
eye
down
the
paper
then
he
looked
at
doctor
hoff
with
a
half
smile
you
did
notice
anything
peculiar
about
this
list
do
know
as
i
not
the
er
nitric
acid
for
instance
nope
what
of
it
mr
hoff
your
son
has
been
caught
by
one
of
the
oldest
tricks
in
the
whole
bunco
list
the
lost
spanish
mine
swindle
that
acid
together
with
the
rest
of
the
outfit
means
a
as
plain
as
if
it
were
spelled
out
and
the
spanish
professor
was
sent
for
not
to
give
lessons
but
to
translate
the
fake
letter
where
does
your
son
bank
fifth
telephone
there
and
find
out
how
much
he
doctor
hoff
sat
down
at
the
five
hundred
dollars
he
said
presently
is
that
all
asked
the
other
disappointed
yes
wait
he
had
six
checks
certified
aggregating
ten
thousand
then
it
is
south
america
or
the
west
indies
he
want
a
letter
of
credit
there
must
be
some
part
of
the
united
states
or
just
across
the
border
well
we
done
a
good
day
work
and
i
got
a
hard
evening
thinking
before
me
we
might
be
able
to
head
off
the
personally
conducted
expedition
yet
if
we
could
locate
the
evening
thinking
formulated
itself
into
a
telegram
to
average
jones
club
the
cosmic
it
was
one
among
the
many
distinctions
of
the
modest
little
club
in
gramercy
park

do

when

up

out

how
they

an
old

easy
but
i
did
he
was
that
to
do
him
justice
he
is
quite
they
put
it
up
on
him
rather
cleverly
in
the
period
of
waiting
to
hear
from
the
geographical
expert
i
put
in
some
fairly
hard
work
going
over
your

effects
and
in
the

over
silent
charley
bar
i
found
a

with

in

handed
to

after
reading
it
over
twice
that
do
tell
me
no
yet
it
pretty
plain
the
two
crooks
the
letter
and
map
on
your
son
probably
slipped
them
into
a
pocket
of
his
coat
while
he
was
drunk
then
they
inserted
their
little
ad
waited
until
he
had
time
to
find
the
letter
and
casually
called
the
advertisement
to
his
attention
the
rest
would
be
easy
but
i
have
something
to
say
to
my
clerk
who
failed
to

blustered

you

ye
snarled
the

his
avaricious
soul
in
revolt
at
the

outlay
when
i
hire
a
man
i
expect
him
to
pay
his
own

and
send

agreed
the

blandly
but
you
see
you
are
hiring
me
i
doing
this
on

i
do
propose
to
invest
anything
in

the
other
i
good
for
five
million
dollars
in
this
i
know
you
are
in

agreed
the
other
equably
that
why
i
want
your
valued
signature
you
see
to
be
quite
frank
i
have
the
fullest
confidence
in
gentlemen
in
your

my

draw
up
a

it
after
you
promised
the

with
a
crafty
look
no
you
wo
began
average
jones
but
he
broke
off
with
a
smile
very
well
he
amended
if
things
work
out
as
i
figure
them
that
will
do
and
he
added
dropping
into
his
significant
drawl
and
looking
the

flatly
in
the
eye

you

bank
on
my

uncomfortably
pondering
this

doctor

set
about
the
matter
of
the
expense
money
mean
time
a
telegram
came
which
settled
the
matter
of
immediate
destination
it
apprised
average
jones
that
a
fortnight
previous
this
paragraph
had
appeared
in
the
paid
columns
of
the
yuma
yucca
sailboat
centerboard
type
preferred
hasty
care
this
office
average
jones
bought
a
ticket
for
yuma
disembarking
at
the
yuma
station
three
days
later
average
jones
blinked
in
the
harsh
sunlight
at
a
small
compactly
built
man
roughly
dressed
for
the
trail
i
captain
funcke
said
the
stranger
his
speech
was
gentle
slow
even
hesitant
but
there
was
something
competent
and
reliable
in
his
bearing
which
satisfied
the
shrewd
young
reader
of
men
characters
from
the
outset
your
wire
got
me
two
days
since
and
i
came
right
any
trace
left
here
two
days
three
of
them
yes
boat
pretty
know
anything
of
the
men
only
the
big
one
calls
himself
colonel
richford
had
a
fake
copper
outfit
in
the
mountains
east
of
where
do
you
think
they
headed
for
probably
the
wildest
country
they
can
find
if
they
want
to
get
rid
of
young
hoff
said
the
other
who
had
been
apprised
of
the
main
points
of
the
situation
that
would
likely
be
the
pinto
range
to
the
southwest
of
the
laguna
richford
knows
that
country
a
little
he
was
in
there
two
years
they
would
probably
want
to
get
rid
of
him
without
obvious
murder
said
average
jones
you
see
his
money
is
in
certified
checks
which
they
have
to
get
cashed
if
some
one
should
find
his
body
with
a
in
it
they
have
some
explaining
to
nobody
be
likely
to
find
it
only
about
two
parties
a
year
get
down
there
still
somebody
might
trail
him
and
i
guess
old
richford
is
too
foxy
to
do
any
killing
when
he
turns
the
trick
just
as
well
without
suppose
it
the
pintos
then
how
do
we
get
there
breeze
returned
the
other
succinctly
our
rowboat
is
outfitted
and
good
work
said
jones
heartily
how
far
is
it
sixty
miles
to
the
turn
of
the
laguna
there
a
current
to
help
they
a
scant
two
days
start
and
we
catch
up
some
for
their
boat
is
heavier
and
their
sail
is
no
good
with
the
wind
in
this
direction
if
we
do
catch
up
some
he
added
grimly
i
would
want
to
insure
our
young
friend
life
so
it
all
aboard
if
you
for
the
first
time
since
embarking
upon
the
strange
seas
of
advertising
in
his
quest
of
the
adventure
of
life
average
jones
now
met
the
experience
of
grilling
physical
toil
all
that
day
and
all
the
night
the
two
men
swung
at
the
oars
swung
until
every
muscle
in
the
young
easterner
back
had
turned
to
live
and
the
flesh
had
begun
to
strip
from
the
palms
of
his
hands
even
so
the
hardy
captain
had
done
most
of
the
work
aided
by
the
current
they
turned
the
shoulder
of
the
cocopah
range
as
the
dawn
shone
lurid
in
the
east
and
the
captain
swung
the
boat
head
to
the
southern
shore
of
the
lake
meantime
between
spells
at
the
oars
average
jones
had
outlined
the
case
in
full
to
funcke
he
could
have
found
no
better
coadjutor
by
nature
and
equipment
every
really
expert
hunter
and
tracker
is
a
detective
the
subtleties
of
the
trail
sharpen
both
physical
and
mental
sensibility
captain
funcke
was
by
instinct
a
student
of
that
continuous
logic
which
constitutes
the
science
of
the
chase
whether
the
prize
of
pursuit
be
a
mountain
sheep
horns
or
the
scholar
need
of
praise
for
the
interpreting
of
some
inscription
on
a
tomb
after
long
and
silent
consideration
the
captain
gave
his
views
it
is
bunco
it
a
if
richford
had
wanted
to
stick
young
hoff
he
never
have
brought
him
here
there
is
enough
within
eighty
miles
to
gild
a
cigar
band
it
looks
to
me
like
the
scheme
is
this
they
get
him
off
in
the
mountains
out
of
sight
of
the
lake
so
he
have
no
landmark
to
go
by
then
they
scare
him
into
signing
papers
and
make
him
turn
over
those
certified
checks
to
them
with
the
papers
to
show
for
it
they
go
out
by
calexico
and
cash
the
checks
in
los
angeles
they
could
put
up
the
bluff
that
their
partner
was
guarding
the
mine
while
they
bought
machinery
and
outfitted
that
be
good
enough
to
cash
certified
checks
yes
that
about
the
way
i
figure
it
out
you
spoke
of
being
able
to
get
rid
of
young
hoff
effectually
without
actual
all
he
have
to
do
would
be
to
quit
the
boy
while
he
was
asleep
a
tenderfoot
would
die
of
thirst
over
there
in
a
short
is
there
no
water
there
a
tenaja
they
depending
on
but
i
doubt
if
they
find
any
water
there
now
it
been
an
extra
dry
a
tenaja
queried
the
holding
rainwater
explained
the
hunter
there
been
no
rainfall
since
august
if
they
find
the
tenaja
empty
they
have
barely
enough
in
the
canteens
they
pack
to
get
them
to
the
next
water
the
tenaja
poquita
around
behind
the
mountains
and
across
the
desert
into
the
next
what
the
next
water
to
that
the
stream
of
palms
that
a
day
and
a
half
on
for
the
space
of
a
hundred
average
jones
ruminated
suppose
er
they
did
er
find
any
water
in
the
tenaja
poquita
either
he
drawled
then
they
would
be
up
against
and
there
no
other
water
in
the
pintos
yes
there
is
said
the
captain
there
a
tenaja
that
so
high
up
and
so
hidden
that
it
only
known
to
one
other
man
besides
me
and
an
indian
it
less
than
an
hour
from
the
tenaja
that
richford
will
take
his
party
to
and
we
sure
of
finding
water
there
it
never
dries
up
this
get
me
to
young
hoff
then
captain
you
in
command
from
the
moment
we
it
was
broad
day
when
the
keel
pushed
softly
into
the
muddy
bottom
of
a
long
shallow
arm
of
the
lake
captain
funcke
rose
stretched
the
kinks
out
of
his
back
and
jumped
ashore
you
say
i
in
command
he
inquired
then
you
roll
up
under
that
mesquite
and
fall
asleep
i
going
to
cast
about
for
their
to
the
oarsman
it
seemed
only
a
few
moments
later
that
an
insistent
grip
on
his
shoulder
aroused
him
but
the
overhead
sun
whose
direct
rays
were
fairly
boiling
the
sweat
out
of
him
harshly
corrected
this
impression
i
found
their
boat
said
captain
funcke
the
trail
heads
for
the
pintos
they
traveling
heavy
i
do
believe
they
hours
ahead
of
average
jones
stumbled
to
his
feet
i
ready
he
said
it
a
case
of
travel
the
hunter
handed
over
a
small
bag
of
food
and
a
large
canteen
full
of
water
he
himself
packed
a
much
larger
load
including
two
canteens
and
a
powerful
taking
a
shotgun
from
the
boat
he
shouldered
it
and
set
out
at
a
long
easy
stride
to
average
jones
the
memory
of
that
day
has
never
been
wholly
clear
sodden
with
weariness
dazzled
and
muddled
by
the
savage
he
followed
with
eyes
fixed
the
rhythmically
monotonously
moving
feet
of
his
leader
through
an
interminable
desert
of
soft
clogging
sand
a
desert
which
dropped
away
into
parched
arroyos
and
rose
to
scorched
mesas
whereon
fierce
cacti
thrust
at
him
with
thorns
and
spikes
a
desert
dead
and
mummified
in
the
dreadful
heat
a
lifeless
inferno
wherein
moved
neither
beast
bird
nor
insect
he
remembers
dimly
lying
as
he
fell
when
the
indefatigable
captain
called
a
halt
and
being
wakened
in
the
chill
breeze
of
evening
to
see
a
wall
of
mountains
blocking
the
advance
food
brought
him
to
his
normal
self
again
and
in
the
crisp
air
of
night
he
set
his
face
to
the
task
of
climbing
severe
as
this
was
upon
his
unaccustomed
muscles
the
firm
rocks
were
still
a
welcome
relief
after
the
racking
looseness
of
sand
that
interminably
sank
away
from
foothold
at
midnight
the
wearied
pursuers
dropped
down
from
a
high
plateau
to
a
narrow
arroyo
here
again
was
sand
fortunately
this
time
for
in
it
footprints
stood
out
clear
illuminated
by
the
white
moonlight
they
led
direct
to
a
side
barranca
there
the
pursuers
found
the
camp
it
was
deserted
like
a
hound
on
the
trail
captain
funcke
cast
about
him
here
where
they
came
in
no
yes
this
is
it
confound
the
here
one
of
them
cuts
across
the
ridge
to
the
tenaja
for
water
wait
what
this
coyote
trail
yes
but
trail
brushed
over
by
thunder
they
did
do
it
carefully
enough
straight
for
the
rocky
mesa
that
it
they
made
their
sneak
while
hoff
was
asleep
probably
covering
trail
behind
them
and
struck
out
for
the
inside
desert
route
to
the
tenaja
he
took
a
quick
look
about
the
camp
and
picked
up
an
empty
canteen
of
course
they
would
leave
him
any
then
he
gone
to
hunt
it
suggested
average
jones
which
way
you
ca
tell
which
way
a
tenderfoot
will
go
said
the
hunter
philosophically
if
he
had
any
savvy
at
all
he
follow
the
old
beaten
track
around
by
the
arroyo
to
the
we
try
on
the
way
average
jones
noticed
his
companion
stop
frequently
to
examine
the
sand
for
something
which
he
evidently
did
find
these
are
fresh
footsteps
we
following
are
they
he
asked
yes
it
is
that
he
went
this
way
all
right
but
the
tenaja
gone
how
can
you
tell
that
no
fresh
sign
of
animals
going
this
way
must
have
been
dry
for
weeks
our
mining
friends
have
taken
what
little
water
there
was
and

of
thirst
said
the

grimly
well
that

the
empty
canteen
all
he
turned
and
renewed
his
quick
progress
leaping
from
boulder
to
boulder
between
narrowing
walls
of
rock
just
as
average
jones
was
spent
and
almost
ready
to
collapse
the
leader
checked
hark
he
whispered
above
the
beating
of
the
blood
in
his
ears
jones
heard
an
irregular
insistent
scuffing
sound
he
crouched
in
silence
while
the
captain
crept
up
to
a
ledge
and
cautiously
peered
over
then
went
forward
in
response
to
the
other
urgent
beckoning
they
looked
down
into
a
of
wild
and
curious
beauty
to
this
day
average
jones
remembers
the
luminous
grace
and
splendor
of
a
matilija
poppy
which
rooted
between
two
boulders
swayed
gently
in
the
white
moonlight
above
a
figure
of
dread
the
figure
naked
from
the
waist
up
huddled
upon
the
mud
digging
madly
at
the
earth
a
sharp
exclamation
broke
from
average
jones
the
digger
turned
collapsed
to
his
knees
and
pointed
with
bleeding
fingers
to
his
open
mouth
in
which
the
tongue
showed
black
and
swollen
they
went
down
to
him
an
hour
later
rickey
hoff
was
sleeping
the
sleep
of
utter
exhaustion
in
camp
average
jones
felt
amply
qualified
to
join
him
but
it
was
not
in
the
character
to
quit
an
enterprise
before
it
was
wholly
completed
so
long
as
the
two
bandits
were
on
their
way
to
cash
the
young
spendthrift
checks
jones
had
heard
from
the
victim
a
brief
account
of
the
extortion
success
was
not
fully
won
we
got
to
get
that
money
back
he
said
to
captain
funcke
with
conviction
the
hunter
made
no
reply
in
words
he
merely
leaned
his
shotgun
against
his
thigh
reached
around
beneath
his
coat
and
produced
a
caliber
revolver
this
he
held
out
toward
jones
good
thing
to
have
conceded
the
other
but
well
no
not
in
this
case
they
got
the
booty
with
a
show
of
legality
since
hoff
signed
the
copartnership
agreement
and
turned
over
the
checks
it
was
under
duress
and
threats
it
true
but
who
to
prove
that
they
being
two
to
one
and
this
being
mexico
no
they
within
the
law
and
i
a
notion
that
we
can
get
the
swag
back
by
straight
sale
and
barter
provided
always
we
can
catch
them
in
they
want
to
make
pretty
good
time
to
the
tenaja
poquita
pointed
out
the
captain
they
shy
on
on
wind
too
they
traveled
hard
and
they
ca
be
in
the
pink
of
condition
according
to
hoff
they
deserted
him
while
he
was
taking
a
nap
about
four
in
the
afternoon
it
a
fair
bet
they
camp
for
the
night
as
you
say
it
an
eight
hour
hike
to
the
eight
the
way
they
then
er
there
a
er
shorter
way
drawled
average
jones
removing
some
sand
from
a
wrinkle
in
his
scarified
and
soiled
trousers
as
carefully
as
if
that
were
the
one
immediate
and
important
consideration
in
life
yes
across
the
padre
cliffs
it
cuts
off
about
four
hours
and
it
takes
us
almost
to
the
secret
tenaja
i
spoke
of
we
can
fill
up
there
but
it
not
what
you
call
safe
even
in
but
to
a
hunter
would
it
be
well
worth
the
risk
for
a
record
pair
of
horns
even
if
they
were
only
tin
horns
queried
average
jones
suggestively
captain
funcke
relaxed
into
a
grin
he
nodded
what
we
do
with
him
he
asked
jerking
his
head
toward
the
sleeper
leave
him
water
food
and
a
note
now
about
this
tenaja
poquita
headed
for
how
much
water
do
you
think
there
is
in
it
if
there
a
hundred
gallons
it
doing
well
this
dry
average
jones
got
painfully
to
his
feet
looking
carefully
over
the
scattered
camp
outfit
he
selected
from
it
a
collapsible
pail
captain
funcke
glanced
at
it
with
curiosity
but
characteristically
forebore
to
ask
any
questions
he
himself
shouldered
the
largest
canteen
this
be
enough
for
both
until
we
reach
the
supply
he
said
need
so
much
water
at
but
the
tenderfoot
hung
upon
his
own
shoulder
not
only
the
smallest
of
their
three
canteens
but
also
the
empty
one
which
they
had
found
in
the
camp
their
own
third
tin
almost
full
they
left
beside
hoff
with
a
note
i
a
notion
said
jones
that
i
need
all
these
receptacles
for
water
in
my
own
peculiar
all
right
assented
the
other
patiently
he
took
one
of
them
and
the
pail
from
jones
and
skillfully
disposed
them
on
his
own
back
ready
hike
two
hours
of
the
roughest
kind
of
climbing
brought
them
to
a
landslide
these
sudden
shiftings
of
the
slopes
are
a
frequent
feature
of
travel
in
the
lower
california
mountains
often
obliterating
trails
and
costing
the
wayfarer
painful
and
perilous
search
for
a
new
path
on
the
padre
cliffs
however
had
occurred
that
rare
phenomenon
a
benevolent
avalanche
piling
up
a
safe
and
feasible
embankment
around
the
angle
of
an
impracticable
precipice
and
thus
saving
an
hour
of
the
most
ticklish
going
of
the
journey
thanks
to
this
dispensation
the
two
men
reached
the
tenaja
poquita
before
dawn
scouting
ahead
the
captain
reported
no
fresh
trail
except
coyotes
and
mule
deer
and
not
more
than
gallons
of
water
in
the
basin
of
this
they
both
drank
deeply
then
after
they
had
filled
all
the
canteens
average
jones
unfolded
his
scheme
to
the
captain
if
any
one
caught
us
at
it
commented
that
experienced
hunter
be
shot
without
warning
however
the
water
would
be
evaporated
in
a
few
days
anyhow
and
i
post
notices
at
the
next
watercamps
i
with
taking
turn
and
turn
about
with
the
pail
they
bailed
out
the
scattering
the
water
upon
the
greedy
sand
what
little
moisture
remained
in
the
sticky
mud
at
the
bottom
they
blotted
up
with
more
sand
they
then
rolled
in
boulders
average
jones
looked
down
into
the
hollow
with
satisfaction
and
moved
his
full
canteens
into
a
grotto
this
company
he
said
is
now
open
for
at
eight
there
was
a
clatter
of
boots
upon
the
rocks
and
two
men
came
staggering
up
the
defile
colonel
richford
and
his
partner
did
not
look
to
be
in
good
repair
the
colonel
face
was
drawn
and
his
companion
the
fred
of
silent
charley
bar
was
bloated
and
shaken
with
liquor
both
panted
with
the
hard
dry
breath
of
the
first
stage
of
the
colonel
who
was
in
the
lead
checked
and
started
upon
discovering
astride
of
a
rock
a
pleasant
visaged
young
man
of
a
familiar
american
type
whose
appearance
was
in
nowise
remarkable
except
as
to
locality
with
a
grunt
that
might
have
been
greeting
but
was
more
probably
surprise
the
newcomer
passed
the
seated
man
captain
funcke
he
did
not
see
at
all
that
astute
hunter
had
dropped
behind
a
boulder
at
the
brink
of
the
tenaja
the
colonel
stopped
dead
then
with
an
outburst
of
flaming
language
he
leaped
in
burrowing
among
the
rocks
dry
he
yelled
lifting
a
furious
and
appalled
face
to
his
companion
fred
stood
staring
from
average
jones
to
his
three
canteens
there
was
a
murderous
look
on
his
sinister
face
got
water
he
growled
yes
replied
the
young
man
here
colonel
said
fred
here
drink
for

added
average
jones
calmly
people

returned
average
jones
cheerfully
you

a
soulless
corporation
the
north
pinto
gold
mining
what
that
cried
the
colonel
thickly
his
hand
flew
back
to
his
belt
then
it
dropped
limp
at
his
side
for
he
was
gazing
into
the
two
barrels
of
a
shotgun
which
materializing
over
a
rock
were
pointing
accurately
and
disconcertingly
at
the
pit
of
his
stomach
from
behind
the
gun
captain
funcke
quiet
voice
remarked
i
would
colonel
as
for
you
he
added
turning
to
the
other
wayfarer
who
carried
a
rifle
you
want
to
remember
that
a
shotgun
has
two
barrels
usually
both
stepping
forward
average
jones
lifted
the
financier
weapon
then
he
deprived
fred
of
his
rifle
amid
a
surprisingly
brilliant
outburst
of
verbal
pyrotechnics
now
we
can
talk
business
comfortably
he
observed
i
ca
talk
at
all
pretty
quick
if
i
do
git
a
moistener
said
fred
piteously
pouring
out
a
scant
cupful
of
water
into
his
hat
average
jones
handed
it
over
drink
slowly
he
advised
you
got
about
a
hundred
dollars
worth
there
at
present
colonel
richford
head
went
up
with
a
jerk
hundred
dollars
worth
he
croaked
his
eyes
fiery
with
suspicion
are
you
going
to
hold
up
two
men
dying
of
thirst
there
been
only
one
man
in
danger
of
that
death
around
here
his
name
is
the
redoubtable
colonel
gasped
and
leaned
back
against
a
rock
you
be
relieved
to
learn
that
he
safe
now
to
answer
your
question
no
i
do
propose
to
hold
up
two
men
for
anything
i
propose
to
deal
with
the
president
and
treasurer
of
the
north
pinto
gold
mining
company
as
a
practical
mining
man
you
will
appreciate
the
absolute
necessity
of
water
in
your
operations
the
nearest
available
supply
is
some
ten
hours
distant
before
you
could
reach
it
i
fear
that
er
your
company
would
er
have
gone
out
of
existence
therefore
i
am
fortunate
in
being
able
to
offer
you
a
small
supply
which
i
will
put
on
the
market
at
the
low
rate
of
ten
thousand
dollars
i
may
add
that
er
certified
checks
will
er
be
for
two
hours
the
colonel
with
the
occasional
objurgatory
assistance
of
his
partner
talked
begged
argued
threatened
and
even
wept
by
the
end
of
that
time
his
tongue
was
making
sounds
like
a
muffled
castanet
and
his
resolution
was
scorched
out
of
him
you
got
us
he
croaked
here
your
checks
give
me
the
in
proper
and
legal
form
please
said
average
jones
he
produced
a
contract
and
a
the
contract
was
duly
signed
and
witnessed
it
provided
for
the
transfer
of
the
water
in
consideration
of
one
revolver
and
ten
thousand
dollars
in
checks
these
checks
were
endorsed
over
to
jones
whereupon
he
turned
over
the
pail
of
water
and
the
largest
canteen
to
the
parched
miners
then
sorting
out
the
checks
he
pocketed
two
aggregating
five
thousand
dollars
tore
up
three
and
holding
the
other
in
his
hand
turned
to
captain
funcke
will
five
hundred
dollars
pay
you
for
keeping
young
hoff
down
here
a
couple
of
months
and
making
the
beginning
of
a
man
of
him
he
asked
yes
and
more
replied
the
captain
it
a
go
said
average
jones
i
like
to
make
the
job
then
courteously
bidding
the
north
pinto
gold
mining
company
farewell
the
two
clambered
up
the
rocks
and
disappeared
beyond

abrupt

conrad

sat
in
the
private
office
of

the
young

was
thinner

harder

than
the

of
two
weeks
previous
doctor
hoff
looked
him
over
with
shrewd
eyes
say
your

ai
done
you
no
harm
has
it
he
exclaimed
with
a
boisterous
and
false
good
nature
you
look
like
a
hope
the
boy
comes
out
as
good
you
say
he
all
right
you
got
his
letter
in
which
he
says
so
himself
that
enough
proof
is
it
oh
i
got
the
letter
all
right
an
it
enough
as
far
as
it
goes
but
it
ai
proof
not
the
kind
of
proof
a

pays
out

money
on
he
added
cunningly
you
say
you
left
roddy
down
there
with
that
funcke
feller
hey
yes
it
make
a
man
of
him
if

or

or
anywhere
else
for

said
average
jones
indifferently
is
that
so
the
quack
voice
had
taken
on
a
sneering
intonation
you
come
back
here
with
your
job
not
half
done
with
the
guilty
fellers
loose
an
runnin
an
you
expect
me
to
pay
over
the
five
thousand
dollars
to
you
huh
no
i
er
do
expect
er
anything
of
the
sort
said
average
jones
slowly
doctor
hoff
little
restless
eyes
puckered
at
the
corners
he
was
puzzled
what
did
the
young
fellow
mean
do
eh
he
said
groping
in
his
mind
for
a
solution
no
you
forgot
to
send
me
that
promised
form
of
agreement
did
you
thought
you
fooled
me
perhaps
well
i
would
be
so
foolish
as
to
expect
anything
in
the
way
of
fair
and
honorable
dealing
when
i

to
do
up
a
mining
swindler
for
the
benefit
of
the
only
meaner

i
took
say
be
careful
of
what
you

young
man
blustered
the
quack
i
am
quite
particular
and
before
you
leave
would
you
like
to
hear
about
the
five
thousand
dollars
i
got

doctor
hoff
blinked
rapidly
what

he
finally
inquired
five
er
thousand
er

got
it
in
the
where
dje
get
it
from

doctor

blinked
more
rapidly
and
moistened
his
lips
with
an
effortful
tongue
dje
work

asked
in
a
voice

that
in
the
opening
sentence
and
the
specification
that
the
applicant
must
be
without
family
does
that
inspire
any
notion
above
a
yawn
in
your
palsied
processes
of
mind
it
does
several
notions
i
yawned
explained
average
jones
with
dignity
because
i
perceive
with
pain
that
i
shall
have
to
go
to
work
what
do
you
make
of
the
thing
yourself
well
this
man
smith
what
man
smith
smith
of
bellair
street
who
signs
the
average
jones
laughed
there
is
any
smith
he
said
what
do
you
know
about
it
demanded
bertram
sitting
up
only
what
the
advertisement
tells
me
it
was
written
by
a
foreigner
that
too
obvious
for
argument
generous
in
proper
person
did
a
smith
ever
write
that
no
a
borgrevsky
might
have
or
a
greiffenhauser
or
even
a
mavronovoupoulos
but
never
well
it
nothing
to
me
what
his
name
is
only
i
thought
you
might
be
the
aspiring
young
scientist
he
was
yearning
would
wonder
if
i
were
thank
you
let
see
bellair
street
where
the
directory
thanks
yes
it
is
greenwich
village
well
i
think
i
just
stroll
down
that
way
and
have
a
look
after
thus
it
was
that
adrian
van
reypen
egerton
jones
found
himself
on
a
hot
may
evening
pursuing
the
adventure
of
life
into
the
vestibule
of
a
rather
dingy
old
house
which
had
once
been
the
abode
of
solemn
prosperity
if
not
actual
aristocracy
in
the
olden
days
of
new
york
city
almost
immediately
the
telegraphic
click
of
the
lock
apprised
him
that
he
might
enter
and
as
he
stepped
into
the
hallway
the
door
of
the
apartment
opened
to
him
you
will
please
come
in
said
a
voice
the
tone
was
gentle
and
measured
also
it
was
by
its
accent
alien
to
any
rightful
smith
the
visitor
stepped
into
a
passageway
which
was
dim
until
he
entered
it
and
the
door
swung
behind
him
then
it
became
pitch
black
you
will
pardon
this
said
the
voice
a
severe
affection
of
the
eyes
compels
you
are
smith
asked
average
jones
yes
your
hand
if
you
the
visitor
groping
brushed
with
his
fingers
the
back
of
a
hand
which
felt
strangely
hot
and
pulpy
immediately
the
hand
turned
and
closed
and
he
was
led
forward
to
an
inner
room
and
seated
in
a
chair
the
gentle
hot
clasp
relaxed
and
left
his
wrist
free
a
door
facing
him
if
his
ears
could
be
trusted
opened
and
shut
you
will
find
matches
at
your
elbow
said
the
voice
coming
dulled
from
a
further
apartment
doubtless
you
would
be
more
comfortable
with
a
thank
you
returned
average
jones
enormously
entertained
by
the
setting
which
his
host
had
provided
for
him
he
lighted
the
gas
and
looked
about
a
sparsely
furnished
room
without
a
single
distinguishing
feature
unless
a
high
and
which
stood
on
a
chair
near
by
could
be
so
regarded
the
voice
interrupted
his
survey
you
have
come
in
answer
to
my
advertisement
yes
you
are
then
of
scientific
pursuit
of
scientific
ambition
at
least
i
hope
to
meet
your
your
name
if
you
jones
jones
of
new
york
you
live
with
your
family
i
have
no
family
or
near
that
is
well
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
there
are
risks
but
the
pay
is
high
can
you
endure
exposure
laboring
in
all
weathers
subsisting
on
rough
fare
and
sleeping
as
you
may
i
have
camped
in
the
northern
yes
mused
the
voice
you
look
average
jones
arose
you
er
are
spying
upon
me
then
he
drawled
quietly
i
might
have
er
suspected
a
he
advanced
slowly
toward
the
door
whence
the
voice
came
a
chair
blocked
his
way
without
lowering
his
gaze
he
shoved
at
the
obstacle
with
his
foot
have
a
care
warned
the
voice
the
chair
toppled
and
overturned
from
it
fell
with
a
light
shock
the
strange
valise
which
striking
the
floor
flew
open
disclosing
a
small
cardboard
cabinet
across
the
front
of
the
cabinet
was
a
strip
of
white
paper
labeled
in
handwriting
each
letter
being
individual
with
what
looked
to
the
young
man
like
the
word
he
stooped
to
replace
the
bag
do
not
touch
it
ordered
the
voice
peremptorily
average
jones
straightened
up
to
face
the
door
again
i
will
apologize
for
my
clumsiness
he
said
slowly
when
you
explain
why
you
have
tried
to
trick
there
was
a
pause
then
presently
said
the
voice
meantime
after
what
you
have
accidentally
seen
you
will
perhaps
appreciate
that
the
employment
is
not
without
its
peril
average
jones
stared
from
the
door
to
the
floored
cabinet
and
back
again
in
stupefaction
perhaps
i
stupid
he
said
but
a
misshapen
valise
containing
a
cabinet
with
a
girl
name
on
it
does
seem
calculated
to
scare
an
man
to
death
it
is
full
of
dynamite
is
it
what
is
your
branch
of
scientific
work
the
other
botany
replied
the
young
man
at
random
no
other
physics
entomology
astronomy
chemistry
biology
the
applicant
shook
his
head
in
repeated
negation
none
that
specialized
ah
i
fear
you
will
not
suit
my
all
right
but
you
have
explained
yet
why
you
been
studying
me
through
a
when
i
am
not
allowed
to
see
after
a
pause
of
consideration
the
voice
spoke
again
you
are
right
since
i
can
not
employ
you
i
owe
you
every
courtesy
for
having
put
you
to
this
trouble
you
will
observe
that
i
am
not
very
the
side
door
swung
open
in
the
dimness
of
the
apartment
average
jones
saw
a
man
huddled
in
a
chair
he
wore
a
black
skull
cap
so
far
as
identification
went
he
was
safe
his
whole
face
was
grotesquely
blotched
and
swollen
so
also
were
the
hands
which
rested
on
his
knees
you
will
pardon
me
said
average
jones
but
i
am
by
nature
cautious
you
have
touched
me
is
it
contagious
a
contortion
of
the
features
probably
indicating
a
smile
made
the
changeling
face
more
hideous
than
before
be
at
peace
he
said
it
is
not
you
can
find
your
way
out
i
bid
you
good
evening
now
i
wonder
mused
average
jones
as
he
jolted
on
the
rear
platform
of
an
eighth
avenue
car
by
what
lead
i
could
have
landed
that
job
i
rather
think
i
missed
all
that
night
and
recurrently
on
many
nights
thereafter
the
poisoned
and
contorted
face
and
the
scrawled
mercy
on
the
cabinet
lurked
troublously
in
his
mind
nor
did
bertram
cease
to
scoff
him
for
his
maladroitness
until
both
of
them
temporarily
forgot
the
strange
smith
and
his
advertisement
in
the
entrancement
of
a
chase
which
led
them
for
a
time
far
back
through
the
centuries
to
a
climax
that
might
well
have
cost
average
jones
his
life
they
had
returned
from
baltimore
and
the
society
of
the
man
who
spoke
latin
a
few
days
when
bertram
at
the
club
called
up
average
jones
office
i
sending
professor
paul
gehren
to
you
was
his
message
he
call
or
average
jones
knew
professor
gehren
by
sight
knew
of
him
further
by
repute
as
an
impulsive
violent
and
learned
pundit
who
for
a
typically
meager
recompense
furnished
sundry
classes
of
young
gentlemen
with
amusement
alarm
and
instruction
in
about
equal
parts
through
the
medium
of
lectures
at
the
metropolitan
university
during
vacations
the
professor
pursued
with
some
degree
of
passion
experiments
which
added
luster
and
selected
portions
of
the
alphabet
to
his
name
twice
a
week
he
walked
to
the
cosmic
club
where
he
was
wont
to
dine
and
express
destructive
and
anarchistic
views
upon
the
nature
conduct
motives
and
personality
of
the
organization
governing
committees
on
the
day
following
bertram
telephone
professor
gehren
entered
astor
court
temple
took
the
elevator
to
the
ninth
floor
and
following
directions
found
himself
scanning
a
window
flaunting
the
capitalized
and
gilded
legend
jones
commented
the
professor
rancorously
a
vicious
verbal
monstrosity
he
read
on
advice
upon
advertising
in
all
forms
consultation
free
step
in
consultation
free
repeated
the
educator
with
virulence
a
trap
a
manifest
pitfall
i
do
know
why
bertram
should
have
sent
me
hither
the
enterprise
is
patently
quack
he
asseverated
in
a
rising
voice
upon
the
word
a
young
man
opened
the
door
and
emerging
received
the
accusation
full
in
the
face
the
young
man
smiled
quack
i
said
repeated
the
exasperated
mentor
and
i
repeat
it
quack
if
you
suffering
from
the
delusion
that
you
a
duck
observed
the
young
man
mildly
you
find
a
taxidermist
on
the
top
the
caller
turned
purple
if
you
are
jones
of
the
cosmic
club
i
there
are
certain
things
which
bertram
must
yes
bertram
said
that
you
were
coming
but
i
almost
given
you
up
come
into
a
a
den
where
free
advice
is
offered
of
all
the
patent
and
infernal
rascalities
sir
the
offer
of
free
advice
there
there
soothed
the
younger
man
i
know
all
about
the
free
swindles
this
is
one
of
them
it
just
a
fad
of
he
led
the
perturbed
scholar
inside
and
got
him
settled
in
a
chair
now
go
ahead
show
me
the
advertisement
and
tell
me
how
much
you
i
lost
my
assistant
there
is
no
advertisement
about
it
what
i
came
for
is
advice
but
upon
seeing
your
tricky
oh
that
merely
to
encourage
the
timorous
who
is
this
assistant
harvey
craig
a
youth
hardly
more
than
a
boy
for
whom
i
feel
a
certain
responsibility
as
his
deceased
parents
left
him
in
my
yes
said
jones
as
the
professor
paused
he
has
when
permanently
since
ten
days
permanently
up
to
that
time
he
had
absented
himself
without
reporting
to
me
for
only
three
or
four
days
at
a
he
lived
with
you
no
he
had
been
aiding
me
in
certain
investigations
at
my
in
what
line
when
did
he
stop
about
four
weeks
did
he
give
any
reason
he
requested
indefinite
leave
work
had
been
offered
him
he
hinted
at
a
very
high
rate
of
you
do
know
by
whom
no
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
have
you
any
definite
suspicions
as
to
his
absence
i
gravely
fear
that
the
boy
has
made
away
with
why
so
after
his
first
absence
i
called
to
see
him
at
his
room
he
had
obviously
undergone
a
violent
paroxysm
of
grief
or
he
told
you
this
no
but
his
eyes
and
indeed
his
whole
face
were
abnormally
swollen
as
with
ah
average
jones
voice
had
suddenly
taken
on
a
bored
indifference
were
er
his
hands
also
his
hands
why
should
they
of
course
why
indeed
you
noted
them
i
did
not
did
he
seem
depressed
or
morose
i
can
not
say
that
he
professor
gehren
what
newspaper
do
you
take
the
scholar
stared
the
citizen
in
the
morning
the
register
in
the
are
either
of
them
delivered
to
your
laboratory
yes
the
do
you
keep
it
on
file
ah
that
a
pity
then
you
would
know
if
one
were
missing
the
professor
reflected
yes
there
was
a
copy
containing
a
letter
upon
von
studeborg
recent
experiments
can
you
recall
the
date
after
the
middle
of
june
i
average
jones
sent
for
a
file
and
handed
it
to
professor
gehren
is
this
it
he
asked
indicating
the
copy
of
june
that
is
the
letter
said
that
gentleman
average
jones
turned
the
paper
and
found
upon
an
inside
page
the
strange
advertisement
from
bellair
street
one
more
question
professor
said
he
when
did
you
last
see
craig
nine
or
ten
days
ago
i
think
it
was
july
how
did
he
impress
you
as
being
somewhat
preoccupied
otherwise
was
his
face
swollen
then
where
did
you
see
him
the
first
time
at
my
laboratory
about
eleven
you
saw
him
again
that
day
then
yes
we
met
by
accident
at
a
little
before
two
on
street
i
was
surprised
because
he
had
told
me
he
had
to
catch
a
noon
train
and
return
to
his
then
he
had
done
so
yes
he
explained
that
he
had
but
that
he
had
been
sent
back
to
buy
some
you
believe
he
was
telling
the
truth
in
an
extensive
experience
with
young
men
i
have
never
known
a
more
truthful
one
than
between
the
first
day
of
his
coming
back
to
new
york
and
the
last
had
you
seen
him
i
had
talked
with
him
over
the
telephone
he
called
up
two
or
three
times
to
say
that
he
was
well
and
working
hard
and
that
he
hoped
to
be
back
in
a
few
where
did
he
call
up
from
as
he
did
not
volunteer
the
information
i
am
unable
to
unfortunate
again
well
i
think
you
may
drop
the
notion
of
suicide
if
anything
of
importance
occurs
please
notify
me
at
once
otherwise
send
you
word
when
i
have
made
having
dismissed
the
anxious
pundit
average
jones
so
immersed
in
thought
as
to
be
oblivious
to
outer
things
made
his
way
to
the
cosmic
club
in
a
series
of
caroms
from
indignant
pedestrian
to
indignant
pedestrian
there
as
he
had
foreseen
he
found
robert
bertram
can
i
detach
you
from
your
usual
bridge
game
this
evening
he
demanded
of
that
languid
gentleman
very
possibly
what
the
inducement
chapter
second
of
the
bellair
street
advertisement
i
told
you
the
first
chapter
you
been
the
so
far
now
come
on
together
they
went
to
the
greenwich
village
house
the
name
smith
had
disappeared
from
the
vestibule
as
i
expected
said
jones
our
hope
be
in
the
landlord
the
landlord
turned
out
to
be
a
german
landlady
who
knew
little
concerning
her
late
tenant
and
evinced
no
interest
in
the
subject
the
perfessor
as
she
termed
smith
had
taken
the
flat
by
the
month
was
prompt
in
payment
quiet
in
habit
given
to
long
and
frequent
absences
had
been
there
hardly
at
all
in
the
last
few
weeks
where
had
he
moved
to
hummel
only
knew
he
had
left
no
address
where
did
his
furniture
go
nowhere
he
left
it
behind
was
any
one
in
the
house
acquainted
with
him
marron
in
the
other
flat
had
tried
to
be
not
much
luck
she
thought
marron
was
voluble
ignorant
and
a
willing
source
of
information
the
perfessor
sure
i
knew
was
me
give
the
name
he
was
a
mejum
naw
not
for
money
too
swell
for
that
but
a
mejum
a
big
one
one
of
the
kind
it
comes
to
nacheral
somethin
fierce
my
kitchen
window
is
on
the
so
his
many
the
time
in
the
still
evenin
i
heard
the
on
his
window
an
on
the
wall
but
mostly
on
the
window
blip
out
of
the
dark
it
make
you
just
hop
and
him
sittin
quiet
and
peaceful
in
the
front
room
all
the
time
yep
my
little
girl
seen
him
there
while
i
was
hearin
the
did
you
ask
him
about
them
inquired
jones
sure
he
would
have
it
at
first
then
he
kinder
smiled
and
half
owned
up
and
once
i
seen
him
with
his
materializin
wand
sittin
in
the
room
almost
his
what
materializin
wand
you
know
as
tall
as
himself
and
all
shiny
and
slick
it
was
slim
and
sort
o
knobby
like
this
wood
the
name
of
it
now
they
make
fish
poles
out
of

dangerous
you
would
caich
me
touchin
it
or
goin
in
there
even
now
i
says
to
kraus
i
says
and
so
the
stream
of
eager
talk
flowed
until
the
two
men
escaped
from
it
into
the
vacant
apartment
this
was
much
as
average
jones
had
seen
on
his
former
visit
only
the
strange
valise
was
missing
going
to
the
kitchen
which
he
opened
through
intermediate
doors
on
a
straight
line
with
the
front
room
average
jones
inspected
the
window
the
glass
was
thickly
marked
with
faint
bluish
blurs
being
indeed
almost
opaque
from
them
in
the
middle
of
the
upper
pane
there
was
nothing
indicative
below
the
window
unless
it
were
a
considerable
amount
of
crumbled
putty
which
he
fingered
with
puzzled
curiosity
in
the
front
room
a
mass
of
papers
had
been
half
burned
some
of
them
were
local
journals
mostly
the
evening
register
a
few
were
publications
in
the
arabic

oriental
newspapers
remarked
bertram
average
jones
picked
them
up
and
began
to
fold
them
from
between
two
sheets
fluttered
a
very
small
bit
of
paper
narrow
and
half
curled
as
if
from
the
drying
of
mucilage
he
lifted
and
read
it
here
we
are
again
bert
he
remarked
in
his
most
casual
tone
the
quality
of
this
mercy
is
strained
all
the
two
men
bent
over
the
slip
studying
it
the
word
was
as
average
jones
had
said
in
a
strained
effortful
handwriting
and
each
letter
stood
distinct
these
were
the
characters
mercy
is
it
mathematical
do
you
think
possibly
asked
average
jones
all
alone
by
itself
like
that
rather
not
more
like
a
label
if
you
ask
the
little
sister
of
the
label
on
the
cabinet
cherchez
la
femme
observed
bertram
it
sounds
like
perfect
foolishness
to
me
a
swollen
faced
outlander
who
rules
familiar
spirits
with
a
wand
and
between
investigations
in
the
realms
of
science
writes
a
girl
name
all
over
the
place
like
a
lovesick
is
mercy
his
do
you
suppose
oh
let
get
out
of
here
said
average
jones
i
getting
dizzy
with
it
all
the
next
step
he
observed
as
they
walked
slowly
up
the
street
is
by
train
want
to
take
a
short
trip
bert
or
perhaps
several
short
trips
whither
away
fair
youth
to
the
place
where
the
fake
and
the
lost
craig
have
been
doing
their
little
i
thought
you
said
professor
gehren
could
tell
you
where
craig
had
no
more
he
could
so
i
got
to
find
out
for
myself
here
the
way
i
figure
it
out
the
two
men
have
been
engaged
in
some
work
that
is
extra
hazardous
so
much
we
know
harvey
craig
has
i
afraid
succumbed
to
it
otherwise
he
have
sent
some
word
to
professor
gehren
he
may
be
dead
or
he
may
only
be
disabled
by
the
dangerous
character
of
the
work
whatever
it
was
in
any
case
our
mysterious
foreign
friend
has
probably
skipped
out
hastily
now
i
propose
to
find
the
railroad
station
they
passed
through
coming
and
going
and
interview
the
ticket
you
got
a
fine
large
contract
on
your
hands
to
find
not
so
large
either
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
look
for
a
place
that
is
very
isolated
and
yet
quite
near
new
how
do
you
know
it
is
quite
near
new
york
because
harvey
craig
went
there
and
back
between
noon
and
two
professor
gehren
says
now
we
got
to
find
such
a
place
which
is
near
a
stretch
of
deserted
swampy
ground
very
badly
infested
with
mosquitoes
i
thought
of
the
hackensack
meadows
just
across
the
river
in
that
is
all
very
well
said
bertram
but
why
mosquitoes
why
the
poisoned
and
swollen
face
and
hands
both
of
them
suffered
from
explained
average
jones
what
else
could
it
be
i
thought
of
or
some
kind
of
plant
they
been
grubbing
so
had
i
but
i
happened
to
think
that
anything
of
that
sort
if
it
had
poisoned
them
once
would
keep
on
poisoning
them
while
mosquitoes
they
could
protect
themselves
against
if
they
did
become
immune
as
they
most
likely
would
as
there
must
have
been
a
lot
of
to
do
the
kind
of
job
that
face
showed
i
naturally
figured
on
a
average
said
bertram
solemnly
there
are
times
when
i
conceive
a
sort
of
respect
for
your
commonplace
and
plodding
intellect
now
let
me
have
my
little
inning
i
used
to
commute
on
the
jersey
and
delaware
short
line
there
a
station
on
that
line
pearlington
by
name
a
combination
of
mosquitoville
lonesomehurst
and
nutting
doon
it
in
the
mathematical
center
of
the
ghastliest
marsh
anywhere
between
here
and
somewhere
else
i
think
that
our
little
summer
resort
and
yours
for
the
nine
train
dismounting
from
that
rather
casual
accommodation
on
the
following
day
the
two
friends
found
pearlington
to
consist
of
a
windowed
inhabited
by
a
hermit
in
a
blue
this
lonely
official
readily
identified
the
subjects
of
average
jones
inquiry
i
guess
i
know
your
friends
all
right
the
dago
was
tall
and
thin
and
had
white
hair
almost
no
he
was
old
neither
he
talked
very
soft
and
slow
used
to
stay
off
in
the
reeds
three
and
four
days
at
a
time
no
ai
seen
him
for
near
a
week
him
nor
his
boat
nor
the
young
fellow
that
was
with
him
sort
of
bugologists
or
something
was
have
you
any
idea
where
we
could
find
their
camp
the
railroad
man
laughed
fine
chance
you
got
of
finding
anything
in
that
swamp
there
ten
square
miles
of
it
every
square
just
like
every
other
square
and
a
hundred
little
islands
and
a
thousand
creeks
and
rivers
winding
you
right
agreed
average
jones
it
would
take
a
month
to
search
it
you
spoke
of
a
it
my
notion
they
must
have
had
a
houseboat
they
could
it
up
on
the
tide
from
the
kills
a
little
one
i
never
saw
no
tent
with
and
they
had
to
have
something
over
their
heads
the
boat
i
seen
have
was
a
rowboat
i
they
used
it
to
go
back
and
forth
thanks
said
average
jones
that
a
good
idea
about
the
on
the
following
day
this
advertisement
appeared
in
the
newspapers
of
several
shore
towns
along
the
new
jersey
and
staten
island
coast
a
drift
a
small
houseboat
lost
several
days
ago
from
the
hackensack
meadows
fifty
dollars
reward
paid
for
information
leading
to
recovery
jones
astor
court
temple
new
york
two
days
later
came
a
reply
locating
the
lost
craft
at
bayonne
average
jones
went
thither
and
identified
it
within
its
single
room
was
uttermost
confusion
testifying
to
the
simplest
kind
of
housekeeping
sharply
terminated
attempt
had
been
made
to
burn
the
boat
before
it
was
given
to
wind
and
current
but
certain
evidences
of
charred
wood
and
the
fact
of
a
succession
of
furious
in
the
week
past
suggested
the
reason
for
failure
in
a
heap
of
rubbish
where
the
fire
had
apparently
started
average
jones
found
first
a
washington
newspaper
which
he
pocketed
next
with
a
swelling
heart
the
wreck
of
the
pasteboard
cabinet
but
no
sign
of
the
strange
valise
which
had
held
it
the
mercy
sign
was
gone
from
the
cabinet
its
place
being
supplied
by
a
placard
larger
in
a
different
handwriting
and
startlingly
more
specific
danger
if
found
destroy
at
once
do
not
touch
with
bare
there
was
nothing
else
gingerly
average
jones
detached
the
sign
the
cabinet
proved
to
be
empty
he
pushed
a
rock
into
it
lifted
it
on
the
end
of
a
stick
and
dropped
it
overboard
one
after
another
eight
little
fishes
glinted
up
through
the
water
turned
their
white
bellies
to
the
sunlight
and
bobbed
motionless
the
investigator
hastily
threw
away
the
label
and
cast
his
gloves
after
it
but
on
his
return
to
the
city
he
was
able
to
give
a
reproduction
of
the
writing
to
professor
gehren
which
convinced
that
anxious
scholar
that
harvey
craig
had
been
alive
and
able
to
write
not
long
before
the
time
when
the
houseboat
was
set
adrift
chapter
the
mercy
sign
two
some
days
after
the
recovery
of
the
houseboat
average
jones
sat
at
breakfast
according
to
his
custom
in
the
cafe
of
the
hotel
palatia
several
matters
were
troubling
his
normally
serene
mind
first
of
these
was
the
loss
of
the
trail
which
should
have
led
to
harvey
craig
second
as
a
minor
issue
the
oriental
papers
found
in
the
deserted
bellair
street
apartment
had
been
proved
by
translation
to
consist
mainly
of
revolutionary
sound
and
fury
signifying
to
the
person
most
concerned
nothing
as
for
the
issue
of
the
washington
daily
culled
from
the
houseboat
there
was
amidst
the
usual
melange
of
social
diplomatic
political
and
city
news
no
marked
passage
to
show
any
reason
for
its
having
been
in
the
possession
of
average
jones
had
studied
and
restudied
the
columns
both
reading
matter
and
advertising
until
he
knew
them
almost
by
heart
during
the
period
of
waiting
for
his
order
to
be
brought
he
was
brooding
over
the
problem
when
he
felt
a
on
his
shoulder
and
turned
to
confront
thomas
colvin
mcintyre
solemn
of
countenance
and
groomed
with
a
supernal
modesty
of
elegance
as
befitted
a
rising
young
diplomat
already
fifth
assistant
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
states
of
america
hello
tommy
said
the
breakfaster
what
you
have
to
drink
an
entente
cordialer
do
joke
said
the
other
i
in
a
pale
pink
funk
i
afraid
to
look
into
the
morning
hello
what
have
you
been
up
to
that
scandalous
it
is
me
replied
the
diplomat
ungrammatically
it
telfik
telfik
bey
wait
a
minute
let
me
the
name
had
struck
a
response
from
some
thought
wire
within
average
jones
perturbed
brain
presently
it
came
to
him
as
visualized
print
in
small
reproduced
to
the
mind
eye
from
the
washington
newspaper
which
he
had
so
exhaustively
studied
this
turk
a
quick
jumper
telfik
bey
guest
of
turkish
embassy
barely
escapes
a
speeding
no
arrest
it
appeared
had
been
made
the
story
indeed
was
brief
and
of
no
intrinsic
importance
other
than
as
a
social
note
but
to
average
jones
it
began
to
glow
luminously
who
is
telfik
bey
he
inquired
he
is
up
to
yesterday
he
was
a
guest
of
this
indeed
skipped
without
paying
his
bill
yes
ah
skipped
that
is
left
suddenly
without
paying
his
bill
if
you
choose
to
put
it
that
the
tone
was
significant
average
jones
good
natured
face
became
grave
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
tommy
was
he
a
friend
of
yours
no
he
was
in
a
sense
a
ward
of
the
department
over
here
on
invitation
this
is
what
has
almost
driven
me
fumbling
nervously
in
the
pocket
of
his
creaseless
white
waistcoat
he
brought
forth
a
death
notice
from
the
dial
he
said
handing
it
to
average
jones
the
clipping
looked
conventional
enough
died

at
the

funeral
services
from
the
turkish
embassy
washington
on
ana
alhari
if
the
newspapers
ever
discover
the
young
diplomat
stopped
short
before
the
enormity
of
the
hypothesis
it
looks
straight
enough
to
me
as
a
death
notice
except
for
the
tail
what
does
alhari
mean
sort
of
a
requiescat
yes
like
a
mice
said
young
mcintyre
bitterly
it
means
that
the
sort
of
requiescat
it
is
ah
then
they
got
him
the
second
what
do
you
mean
by
time
the
washington
incident
of
course
was
the
first
the
attempted
murder
that
is
the
narrow
escape
of
telfik
young
mcintyre
looked
baffled
i
blessed
if
i
know
what
up
to
jones
he
said
but
if
you
do
know
anything
of
this
case
i
need
your
help
in
washington
where
they
failed
we
fooled
the
newspapers
here
where
they
succeeded
who
are
interrupted
jones
that
what
i
here
to
get
at
the
murderers
of
telfik
bey
of
course
my
instructions
are
to
find
out
secretly
if
at
all
for
if
it
does
get
into
the
newspapers
there
be
the
very
deuce
to
pay
it
desirable
that
even
telfik
bey
presence
here
should
have
been
known
for
reasons
which
ah
here
average
jones
remarked
the
resumption
of
his
friend
official
bearing
which
not
being
for
the
public
i
need
not
detail
to
you
need
not
in
point
of
fact
tell
me
anything
about
it
at
all
observed
average
jones
equably
pomposity
fell
away
from
thomas
colvin
mcintyre
leaving
him
palpably
shivering
but
i
need
your
help
need
it
very
much
you
know
something
about
handling
the
newspapers
do
you
i
know
how
to
get
things
in
not
how
to
keep
them
the
other
groaned
it
may
already
be
too
late
what
newspapers
have
you
there
all
of
want
me
to

that
all
and
the

ran
them
swiftly
over
about
the
same
hold
on
here
a
little
something
extra
in
the
on
the
floor
who
discovered
the
tragedy

serious
supposedly

what
that
interrupted
young
mcintyre
half
rising
shot
you
nervous
tommy
i
did

oh
of

shock
the
it
see
here
first
thing
you
know
you
be
getting
me
interested
you
better
open
up
or
shut
up
mcintyre
took
a
long
breath
and
a
resolution
simultaneously
at
any
rate
i
can
trust
you
he
said
telfik
bey
is
not
a
merchant
he
is
a
secret
confidential
agent
of
the
turkish
government
he
came
over
to
new
york
from
washington
in
spite
of
warnings
that
he
would
be
you
certain
he
was
killed
i
only
wish
i
could
believe
anything
shot
the
coroner
and
a
physician
whom
i
sent
can
find
no
trace
of
a
what
do
they
say
the
refuge
of
the
mystified
medico
it
does
satisfy
you
it
wo
satisfy
the
state
and
possibly
not
the
newspapers
come
up
with
me
and
look
the
place
over
average
let
me
send
for
the
that
functionary
came
a
vision
of
perturbation
in
a
coat
upon
assurance
that
average
jones
was
safe
he
led
the
way
to
the
rooms
so
hastily
vacated
by
the
spirit
of
the
turkish
guest
we
succeeded
in
keeping
two
recent
suicides
and
a
blackmail
scheme
in
this
hotel
out
of
the
newspapers
observed
the
manager
morosely
but
this
would
be
the
worst
of
all
if
i
could
have
known
when
the
turkish
embassy
reserved
the
apartment
the
turkish
embassy
never
reserved
any
apartment
for
telfik
bey
put
in
the
fifth
assistant
secretary
of
state
surely
you
are
mistaken
sir
replied
the
hotel
man
i
saw
their
emissary
myself
he
specified
for
rooms
on
the
south
side
either
the
third
or
fourth
floor
would
have
anything
you
gave
him
a
definite
reservation
asked
jones
yes
and
has
the
man
been
here
since
not
to
my
a
turk
you
think
i
suppose
so
foreign
anything
about
him
strike
you
particularly
well
he
was
tall
and
thin
and
looked
sickly
he
talked
very
soft
too
like
a
sick
the
characterization
of
the
pearlington
station
agent
recurred
to
the
interrogator
mind
had
he
er
white
hair
he
half
yawned
replied
the
manager
and
in
the
same
breath
the
budding
diplomat
demanded
what
are
you
up
to
average
why
should
he
average
jones
turned
to
him
to
what
other
hotels
would
the
turkish
embassy
be
likely
to
send
its
men
sometimes
their
charge
goes
to
the
go
up
there
and
find
out
whether
a
room
has
been
reserved
for
telfik
bey
and
if
so
they
would
reserve
at
two
hotels
would
they
by
whom
concluded
average
jones
shaking
his
head
at
the
interruption
find
out
who
occupied
or
reserved
the
apartments
on
either
thomas
colvin
mcintyre
lifted
a
wrinkling
eyebrow
really
jones
he
observed
you
seem
to
be
employing
me
rather
in
the
capacity
of
a
messenger
if
you
think
a
messenger
boy
could
do
it
as
well
ring
for
one
drawled
average
jones
in
his
mildest
voice
meantime
i
be
in
the
turk
room
numbers
and
which
the
manager
opened
after
the
prompt
if
somewhat
sulky
departure
of
mcintyre
proved
to
consist
of
a
small
sitting
room
a
bedroom
and
a
bath
each
with
a
large
window
giving
on
the
well
back
from
fifth
avenue
here
where
he
was
the
manager
indicated
a
spot
near
the
wall
of
the
and
opposite
the
window
he
had
just
pushed
the
button
when
he
how
do
you
know
that
bronson
the
on
that
call
answered
he
knocked
several
times
and
got
no
answer
then
he
opened
the
door
and
saw
telfik
down
all
in
a
where
is
bronson
at
the
hospital
what
from
shock
the
doctors
what
er
about
the
er
shot
the
manager
looked
startled
well
bronson
says
that
just
as
he
opened
the
door
he
saw
a
bullet
cross
the
room
and
strike
the
wall
above
the
you
ca
see
a
bullet
in
he
saw
this
one
insisted
the
manager
as
soon

lost
his
head
and
ran
out
he
had
got
halfway
to
the
elevator
when
he
fell
in
a
sort
of
fainting
fit
he
came
to
long
enough
to
tell
his
story
then
he
got
terribly
nauseated
and
went
off
he
sure
the
man
had
fallen
before
the
explosion
and
he
got
no
answer
to
his
knocking
no
that
why
he
went
in
he
thought
something
might
be
had
anybody
else
been
in
the

past

no

anything

heard
the

and
a
minute
or
two
before
she
had
heard
and
felt
a
jar
from
the
corroborative
of
the
man
having
fallen
before
the
shot
commented
jones
when
i
got
here
five
minutes
later
he
was
quite
dead
continued
the
manager
evidence
of
the
explosion
was
slight
to
the
investigating
eye
of
average
jones
the
wall
showed
an
abrasion
but
as
the
investigator
expected
no
bullet
hole
against
the
leg
of
a
desk
he
found
a
small
metal
shell
which
he
laid
on
the
table
there
your
bullet
he
observed
with
a
smile
it
a
cartridge
anyway
cried
the
hotel
man
he
must
have
been
shot
after
from
inside
the
room
hardly
and
certainly
not
with
that
it
a
very
small
fulminate
of
mercury
shell
and
never
held

no
the
man
was
down
if
not
dead
before
that
went

jones
was
now
at
the
window
taking
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
he
brushed
the
contents
of
the

it
a
dozen
dead
flies
rolled
upon

paper
he
examined
them
thoughtfully
cast
them
aside
and
turned
back
to
the
manager
who
occupy
the
adjoining
rooms
two
maiden
ladies
did
on
the

they
left
said
the
manager
bitterly
been
coming
here
for
ten
years
and
now
they
quit
if
the
facts
ever
get
in
the
newspapers
what
on
the
west
adjoining
nothing
the
corridor
runs
down
then
it
is
probable
that
any

got
into

from

impossible
said
the
manager
here
thomas

arrived
with
a
flushed
face
you
are

said
the

tell
me
to

the
glenargan
office
building
just
opened
jones
volunteered
the
manager
average
jones
turned
again
to
the
window
closed
it
and
fastened
his
handkerchief
in
the
catch
leave
that
there
he
directed
the
manager
do
let
any
one
into
this
room
i
stopping
to
telephone
average
jones
ascertained
that
there
were
no
vacant
offices
on
the
tenth
floor
south
side
of
the
glenargan
apartment
building
facing
the
nederstrom
hotel
the
last
one
had
been
let
two
weeks
before
to
this
he
ascertained
by
judicious
questioning
a
dark
foreign
gentleman
who
was
an
expert
on
rugs
well
satisfied
the
investigator
crossed
over
to
the
skyscraper
across
from
the
palatia
there
he
demanded
of
the
superintendent
a
single
office
on
the
third
floor
facing
north
he
was
taken
to
a
clean
and
vacant
room
one
glance
out
of
the
window
showed
him
his
handkerchief
not
opposite
but
well
to
the
west
too
near
fifth
avenue
he
said
i
do
like
the
roar
of
the
there
one
other
room
on
this
floor
farther
along
said
the
superintendent
but
it
is
in
order
perkins
time
is
up
till
day
after
tomorrow
and
his
things
are
there
yet
he
told
the
janitor
though
that
he
was
leaving
town
and
would
bother
to
take
away
the
things
they
are
worth
much
here
the
they
entered
the
office
in
it
were
only
a
desk
two
chairs
and
a
scrap
basket
the
basket
was
crammed
with
newspapers
one
of
them
was
the
hotel
register
average
jones
found
telfik
bey
name
as
he
had
expected
in
its
roster
i
give
fifty
dollars
for
the
furniture
as
it
glad
to
get
it
was
the
prompt
response
will
you
want
anything
else
now
yes
send
the
janitor
that
worthy
upon
receipt
of
a
considerable
benefaction
expressed
himself
ready
to
serve
the
new
tenant
to
the
best
of
his
ability
do
you
know
when
perkins
left
the
building
yes
sir
this
morning
this
morning
sure
it
was
yesterday
am
i
sure
did
i
help
him
to
the
and
hand
him
his
little
package
that
sick
he
was
he
could
hardly
walk
average
jones
pondered
a
moment
do
you
think
he
could
have
passed
the
night
here
i
know
he
did
was
the
prompt
response
the
scrubwoman
heard
him
when
she
came
this
heard
him
yes
sir
sobbing
the
nerves
of
average
jones
gave
a
sharp
kickback
like
a
his
trend
of
thought
had
suddenly
been
reversed
the
devious
and
scientific
slayer
of
telfik
bey
in
tears
it
seemed
completely
out
of
the
picture
you
may
go
said
he
and
seating
himself
at
the
desk
proceeded
to
an
examination
of
his
newly
acquired
property
the
newspapers
in
the
scrap
basket
mainly
copies
of
the
evening
register
seemed
to
contain
upon
cursory
examination
nothing
germane
to
the
issue
but
scattered
among
them
the
searcher
found
a
number
of
fibrous
chips
they
were
short
and
thick
such
chips
as
might
be
made
by
cutting
a
bamboo
pole
into
cross
lengths
convenient
for
carrying
the
observed
average
jones
with
gusto
that
was
the
package
of
next
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
desk
it
was
bare
except
for
a
few
scraps
of
paper
and
some
writing
implements
but
in
a
crevice
there
shone
a
glimmer
of
glass
with
a
careful
average
jones
pushed
out
a
small
phial
it
had
evidently
been
sealed
with
lead
nothing
was
in
it
its
discoverer
leaned
back
and
contemplated
it
with
stiffened
eyelids
for
upon
its
tiny
improvised
label
was
scrawled
the
mercy
sign
mysterious
before
now
all
but
incredible
for
silent
minutes
average
jones
sat
bemused
then
turning
in
a
messenger
call
he
drew
to
him
a
sheet
of
paper
upon
which
he
slowly
and
consideringly
wrote
a
few
words
you
get
a
dollar
extra
if
this
reaches
the
advertising
desk
of
the
register
office
within
half
an
hour
he
advised
the
uniformed
urchin
who
answered
the
call
the
modern
mercury
seized
the
paper
and
fled
forthwith
punctuality
was
a
virtue
which
average
jones
had
cultivated
to
the
point
of
a
fad
hence
it
was
with
some
discountenance
that
his
clerk
was
obliged
to
apologize
for
his
lateness
first
at
of
july
to
a
very
dapper
and
spruce
young
gentleman
in
pale
mauve
spats
who
would
give
his
name
then
at
of
the
same
day
to
professor
gehren
of
the
metropolitan
university
and
finally
at
to
robert
bertram
when
only
a
moment
before
five
the
entered
the
manner
of
his
apology
was
more
absent
than
fervent
bertram
held
out
a
newspaper
to
him
cast
your
eye
on
that
said
he
the
register
fairly
reeks
with
freaks
average
jones
read
aloud

about

oh
i
do
know
about
its
being
so
freakish
said
average

nonsense
look
at
it
turkish

that
a

is
it
what
that
and
signed
mercy
why
it
the
work
of
a
lunatic
it
my
work
observed
average
jones
blandly
the
three
visitors
stared
a
him
in
silence
rather
a
forlorn
hope
but
sometimes
a
bluff
will
go
he
continued
if
indicates
harvey
craig
as
i
infer
said
professor
gehren
impatiently
are
you
so
infantile
as
to
suppose
that
his
murderer
will
give
information
about
him
average
jones
smiled
drew
a
letter
from
his
pocket
glanced
at
it
and
called
for
a
number
in
hackensack
take
the
professor
gehren
he
said
when
the
reply
came
the
cairnside
hospital
ask
for
information
about
harvey
with
absorbed
intentness
the
other
three
listened
to
the
conversation
hello
may
i
speak
to
harvey
craig
doctor
this
is
professor
gehren
of
the
metropolitan
university
thank
you
doctor
how
is
he
very
grave
ah
has
been
very
grave
wholly
out
of
danger
what
was
the
nature
of
his
illness
when
may
i
see
him
very
well
i
will
visit
the
hospital
morning
thank
you
i
should
have
expected
that
you
would
notify
me
of
his
intervened
then
it
is
most
inexplicable
declared
professor
gehren
turning
to
the
others
the
doctor
states
that
harvey
was
brought
there
at
night
by
a
foreigner
who
left
a
large
sum
of
money
to
pay
for
his
care
and
certain
suggestions
for
his
treatment
one
detail
carefully
set
down
in
writing
was
that
if
reddish
or
purple
dots
appeared
under
nails
he
was
to
be
told
that
smith
released
him
and
advised
his
sending
for
his
friends
at
reddish
or
purple
dots
eh
repeated
average
jones
i
should
like
er
to
have
talked
with
er
that
doctor
before
you
cut
and
i
sir
said
the
professor
with
the
grim
repression
of
the
thinker
stirred
to
wrath
should
like
to
interview
this
perfectly
feasible
i
think
returned
average
jones
a
long
silence
you
do
mean
that
you
located
him
already
cried
young
mcintyre
he
was
so
obliging
as
to
save
me
the
average
jones
held
up
the
letter
from
which
he
had
taken
the
cairnside
hospital
telephone
number
the
advertisement
worked
to
a
charm
smith
gives
his
address
in
this
and
intimates
that
i
may
call
upon
young
mcintyre
rose
you
going
to
see
him
then
at
did
i
understand
you
to
imply
that
i
am
at
liberty
to
accompany
you
inquired
professor
gehren
if
you
care
to
take
the
think
there
be
excitement
asked
bertram
languidly
i
like
to
go
average
jones
nodded
one
or
a
dozen
i
fancy
it
will
be
all
the
same
to
you
think
we
find
him
young
mcintyre
leaped
to
this
conclusion
count
me
in
on
not
perhaps
his
friend
has
gone
back
on
him
then
suggested
mcintyre
unabashed
yes
i
rather
think
that
it
said
average
jones
in
a
curious
accent
has
gone
back
on
him
i
believe
though
i
ca
quite
accurately
place
her
as
yet
here
the
taxi
he
broke
off
all
aboard
that
going
aboard
but
it
likely
to
be
across
town
and
far
up
the
east
side
whizzed
the
car
over
the
bridge
that
leads
away
from
manhattan
island
to
the
north
and
through
quiet
streets
as
little
known
to
the
average
new
yorker
as
are
hong
kong
and
caracas
in
front
of
a
frame
house
it
stopped
on
a
side
porch
over
which
bright
roses
swarmed
like
children
clambering
into
a
hospitable
lap
sat
a
man
with
a
gray
face
he
was
tall
and
slender
and
his
hair
a
dingy
black
was
already
showing
worn
streaks
where
the
color
had
faded
at
average
jones
he
gazed
with
unconcealed
surprise
ah
it
is
you
he
exclaimed
you
he
smiled
are
the
of
the
advertisement
and
these
gentlemen
are
my
you
will
come
in
average
jones
examined
a
nodding
rose
with
an
indulgent
almost
a
paternal
expression
if
you
er
think
it
er
safe
he
murmured
as
if
exacting
a
pledge
the
young
man
held
out
his
hand
the
older
one
unhesitatingly
grasped
it
average
jones
turned
the
long
fingers
which
enclosed
his
back
upward
and
glanced
at
them
ah
he
said
and
nodded
soberly
so
it
is
yes
it
is
that
assented
the
other
i
perceive
that
you
have
communicated
with
craig
how
is
he
out
of
that
is
well
a
fine
and
manly
youth
i
should
have
sorely
regretted
it
if
professor
gehren
broke
in
upon
him
for
the
peril
in
which
you
have
involved
him
sir
you
have
to
answer
to
me
his
the
foreigner
raised
a
hand
he
was
without
family
or
ties
i
told
him
the
danger
he
accepted
it
once
he
was
careless
and
one
is
not
careless
twice
in
that
work
but
he
was
fortunate
too
i
also
was
fortunate
in
that
the
task
was
then
so
far
advanced
that
i
could
complete
it
alone
i
got
him
to
the
hospital
at
night
no
matter
how
for
his
danger
and
illness
i
have
indemnified
him
in
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
dollars
is
it
enough
professor
gehren
bowed
and
you
jones
are
you
a
detective
no
merely
a
follower
of
strange
trails
by
ah
you
have
set
yourself
to
a
dark
one
you
wish
to
know
how
telfik
bey
his
eyes
narrowed
and
glinted
came
to
his
reward
will
you
enter
gentlemen
i
know
this
much
replied
average
jones
as
followed
by
his
friends
he
passed
through
the
door
which
their
host
held
open
with
young
craig
as
an
assistant
you
prepared
in
the
loneliest
part
of
the
hackensack
meadows
some
kind
of
poison
which
i
believe
can
be
made
with
safety
only
in
the
open
the
foreigner
smiled
and
shook
his
head
not
with
safety
even
then
he
said
but
go
you
found
that
your
man
was
coming
to
new
york
knowing
that
he
would
probably
put
up
at
the
palatia
or
the
nederstrom
you
reserved
rooms
for
him
at
both
and
took
an
office
across
from
each
as
it
was
hot
weather
you
calculated
upon
his
windows
being
open
you
watched
for
him
when
he
came
you
struck
him
down
in
his
own
room
with
the
but
how
it
was
the
diplomat
who
interrupted
i
think
with
a
long
by
george
said
bertram
softly
so
the
of
bamboo
was
a
what
led
you
to
that
average
the
spirit
rappings
which
the
talky
woman
in
the
bellair
street
apartment
used
to
hear
that
and
the
remnants
of
putty
i
found
near
the
window
you
see
the
doors
opening
through
the
whole
length
of
the
apartment
gave
a
long
range
where
er
smith
could
practice
he
had
a
sort
of
target
on
the
window
and
every
time
he
blew
a
putty
ball
doubletongue
heard
the
spirit
am
i
right
sir
the
host
bowed
the
fumes
whatever
they
were
killed
swiftly
they
did
instantly
mercifully
too
how
could
you
know
it
was
fumes
demanded
thomas
colvin
mcintyre
by
the
dead
flies
the
effect
upon
the
and
the
fact
that
no
wound
was
found
on
the
body
then
too
there
was
the
fulminate
of
mercury
of
what
possible
use
was
that
asked
professor
gehren
a
question
that
i
asked
myself
sir
a
great
many
times
over
in
the
last
hours
perhaps
smith
could
answer
that
best
though
er
i
think
the
shell
was
blown
through
the
blowpipe
to
clear
the
deadly
fumes
from
the
room
by
its
explosion
before
any
one
else
should
suffer
smith
is
at
least
not
a
wanton
you
are
right
sir
and
i
thank
you
said
the
foreigner
he
drew
himself
up
weakly
but
with
pride
gentlemen
i
am
not
a
murderer
i
am
an
avenger
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
my
conscience
had
any
innocent
person
met
death
through
me
as
for
that
turkish
dog
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
whether
he
did
not
die
too
from
among
the
papers
in
a
tiroir
against
the
wall
he
took
a
french
journal
and
read
translating
fluently
the
article
was
a
bald
account
of
the
torture
outrage
and
massacre
of
armenian
women
and
girls
at
adana
by
the
turks
the
most
hideous
portion
of
it
was
briefly
descriptive
of
the
atrocities
perpetrated
by
order
of
a
high
turkish
official
upon
a
mother
and
two
young
daughters
an
armenian
prisoner
being
dragged
by
in
chains
went
mad
at
the
sight
the
correspondent
stated
i
was
that
prisoner
said
the
reader
the
official
was
telfik
bey
i
saw
my
naked
daughter
break
from
the
soldiers
and
run
to
him
pleading
for
pity
as
he
sat
his
horse
and
i
saw
him
strike
his
spur
into
her
bare
breast
my
wife
the
mother
of
my
children
do
the
protest
came
from
the
fifth
assistant
secretary
of
state
he
had
risen
his
face
was
contracted
and
the

stood
beaded
on
his
forehead
i
i
ca
stand
it
i
got
my
duty
to
do
this
man

made
a
your
pardon
said
the
foreigner
i
have
lived
and
fed
on
and
slept
with
that
memory
ever
since
on
my
release
i
left
my
country
the
enterprise
of
which
i
had
been
the
head
manufacturing
had
interested
me
in
chemistry
i
went
to
england
to
study
further
thence
i
came
to
america
to
you
have
heard
his
confession
all
of
you
said
young
mcintyre
rising
i
shall
have
him
put
under
arrest
pending
advice
from
you
may
save
yourself
the
trouble
i
think
tommy
drawled
average
jones
mr
smith
will
never
be
called
to
account
in
this
world
for
the
murder
execution
of
telfik
you
saw
the
marks
on
my
said
the
foreigner
that
is
the
sure
sign
i
may
live
hours
i
may
live
twice
or
three
times
that
period
the
poison
does
its
work
once
it
gets
into
the
blood
and
there
is
no
help
it
matters
nothing
my
ambition
is
and
it
is
because
of
this
that
you
let
us
find
you
asked
bertram
i
had
a
curiosity
to
know
who
had
so
strangely
traced
my
but
what
was
the
poison
asked
professor
gehren
i
think
jones
has
more
than
a
suspicion
replied
the
doomed
man
with
a
smile
you
will
find
useful
references
on
yonder
shelf
moving
across
to
the
shelf
average
jones
took
down
a
heavy
volume
and
ran
quickly
over
the
leaves
ah
he
said
presently
and
not
noticing
in
his
absorption
that
the
host
had
crossed
again
to
the
tiroir
and
was
quietly
searching
in
a
compartment
he
read
aloud
little
is
known
of
cyanide
of
cacodyl
in
its
action
the
swiftest
and
most
deadly
of
existing
poisons
in
the
bunsen
the
german
chemist
combined
oxide
of
cacodyl
with
cyanogen
a
radical
of
prussic
acid
producing
cyanide
of
cacodyl
or
diniethyl
arsine
cyanide
as
both
of
its
components
are
of
the
deadliest
description
it
is
extremely
dangerous
to
make
it
can
be
made
only
in
the
open
air
and
not
without
the
most
extreme
precaution
known
to
science
lacelles
scott
of
england
nearly
lost
his
life
experimenting
with
it
in
a
small
fraction
of
a
grain
gives
off
vapor
sufficient
to
kill
a
human
being
had
you
known
about
this
stuff
average
asked
bertram
no
i
never
beard
of
it
but
from
its
action
and
from
the
lettered
cabinet
i
judged
that
this
is
all
very
well
broke
in
assistant
secretary
thomas
colvin
mcintyre
but
i
want
this
man
arrested
how
can
we
know
that
he
shamming
and
may
not
escape
us
after
all
by
this
retorted
their
host
he
held
aloft
a
small
glass
vial
and
staggered
weakly
to
the
door
stop
him
said
average
jones
sharply
the
door
closed
on
the
words
there
was
a
heavy
fall
without
followed
by
the
light
tinkle
of
glass
average

who
had
half
crossed
the
room
in
a
leap

to
his
friends
warning
them
back
too
late
we
ca
go
out
yet
wait
for
the
fumes
to

stood
the
four
men
rigid
presently
average
jones
opening
a
rear
window
leaped
to
the
ground
followed
by
the
others
and
came
around
the
corner
of
the
porch
the
dead
man
lay
with
peaceful
face
professor
gehren
uncovered
god
forgive
him
he
said
who
shall
say
that
he
was
not
right
not
i
said
the
young
assistant
secretary
in
awed
tones
i
glad
he
escaped
but
what
am
i
to
do
here
we
are
with
a
dead
body
on
our
hands
and
a
state
secret
to
be
kept
from
the
prying
average
jones
stood
thinking
for
a
moment
then
he
entered
the
room
and
called
up
the
coroner
office
on
the
telephone
listen
you
men
he
said
to
his
companions
then
to
the
official
who
answered
there
a
suicide
at
oliver
avenue
the
bronx
four
of
us
witnessed
it
we
had
come
to
keep
an
appointment
with
the
man
in
connection
with
a
discovery
he
claimed
in
metallurgy
and
found
him
dying
yes
we
will
wait
here
returning
to
the
porch
again
he
cleared
away
the
fragments
of
glass
aided
by
bertram
to
one
of
these
clung
a
shred
of

all

a
little
as
he
thrust
at
it
with
a
stick
look
average
it
the
sign
again
what
a
hideous
travesty
average
jones
shook
his
bead
it
is
bert
it
the
label
that
he
attached
for
precaution
to
everything
that
had
to
do
with
his
deadly
stuff
the
formula
for
cyanide
of
cacodyl
is
it

the
scrawly

was
right
when
i
suggested
that

said
thomas
colvin
mcintyre
with
a
giggle
average
jones
looked
from
the
peaceful
face
of
the
dead
to
the
label
fluttering
in
the
light
breeze
no
he
said
gravely
you
were
wrong
it
was
his
friend
to
the
chapter
vi
blue
fires
cabs
for
comfort
cars
for
company
was
an
apothegm
which
average
jones
had
evolved
from
experience
a
professed
student
of
life
he
maintained
must
keep
in
touch
with
life
at
every
feasible
angle
no
experience
should
come
amiss
to
a
detective
he
should
be
a
pundit
of
all
knowledge
a
detective
he
now
frankly
considered
himself
and
the
real
drudgery
of
his
unique
profession
of
was
supportable
only
because
of
the
compensating
thrill
of
the
occasional
chase
the
radiance
of
the
adventure
of
life
glinting
from
time
to
time
across
his
path
there
were
few
places
average
jones
held
where
human
nature
in
the
rough
can
be
studied
to
better
advantage
than
in
the
stifling
tunnels
of
the
subway
or
the
sardine
boxes
of
the
metropolitan
surface
lines
it
was
in
pursuance
of
this
theory
that
he
encountered
the
westerner
on
third
avenue
car
by
custom
average
jones
picked
out
the
most
interesting
or
unusual
human
being
in
any
assembly
where
he
found
himself
for
study
and
analysis
this
man
was
peculiar
in
that
he
alone
was
not
perspiring
in
the
sodden
august
humidity
the
skin
and
the
rangy
strength
of
the
figure
gave
him
a
certain
distinction
he
held
in
his
sinewy
hands
a
doubly
folded
newspaper
presently
it
slipped
from
his
hold
to
the
seat
beside
him
he
stared
at
the
window
opposite
with
harassed
and
unseeing
eyes
abruptly
he
rose
and
went
out
on
the
platform
average
jones
picked
up
the
paper
in
the
middle
of
the
column
to
which
it
was
folded
was
a
marked
advertisement

suite
owl
building
brooklyn
the
car
was
nearing
brooklyn
bridge
average
jones
saw
his
man
drop
lightly
off
he
followed
and
at
the
bridge
entrance
caught
him
up
you
left
your
paper
he
said
the
stranger
whirled
quickly
right
he
said
thanks
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
where
the
owl
building
are
you
going
there
i
a
slight
wrinkle
of
surprise
appeared
on
the
man
tanned
forehead
perhaps
you
would
he
returned
coolly
in
other
words
your
business
said
average
jones
with
a
smile
something
of
that
sort
admitted
the
stranger
nevertheless
i
would
consult
with
everbody
friend
over
in
the
owl
er
because
er
if
i
may
speak
plainly
drawled
average
jones
i
would
risk
a
woman
name
with
a
gang
of
you
got
your
nerve
retorted
the
stranger
the
keen
eyes
flattening
almost
to
slits
fixed
on
the
impassive
face
of
the
other
well
i
go
you
he
decided
after
a
moment
his
glance
swept
the
range
of
vision
and
settled
upon
a
rathskeller
sign
come
over
there
where
we
can
they
crossed
the
grilling
roadway
and
being
wise
in
the
heat
ordered
soft
drinks
now
said
the
stranger
you
declared
in
on
my
game
make
good
what
your
interest
none
personally
i
like
your
looks
that
all
replied
the
other
frankly
and
i
do
like
to
see
you
run
into
that
spider
you
know
them
twice
in
the
last
year
i
made
change
their
place
of
but
you
do
know
me
and
you
spoke
of
a
i
been
studying
you
on
the
car
explained
average
jones
hard
as
nails
yet
your
nerves
are
on
edge
it
is
illness
so
it
must
be
trouble
on
your
you
got
a
solitaire
diamond
ring
not
for
ornament
you
are
that
sort
of
a
dresser
it
there
for
convenience
until
you
can
find
a
place
to
put
it
when
a
deeply
troubled
man
wears
an
engagement
ring
on
his
watch
chain
it
a
fair
inference
that
there
been
an
obstruction
in
the
course
of
true
love
unless
mistaken
you
being
a
stranger
newly
come
to
town
were
going
to
take
your
case
to
those
sharks
how
do
you
know
i
just
come
to
town
when
you
looked
at
your
watch
i
noticed
it
was
three
hours
slow
that
must
mean
the
pacific
coast
or
near
it
therefore
you
just
got
in
from
the
far
west
and
have
thought
to
rectify
your
time
at
a
venture
i
say
you
were
a
mining
man
from
down
around
the
copper
district
in
arizona
that
peculiar
translucent
copper
silicate
in
your
comes
from
those
the
blue
fire
i
wish
it
had
stayed
there
all
of
it
anything
else
yes
returned
average
jones
warming
to
the
game
you
an
eastern
college
man
i
think
anyway
your
father
or
some
older
member
of
your
family
graduated
from
one
of
the
older

the

from

your

time
in
the
latter
forties
or
early
fifties
hamilton
i
name
a
gleam
of
pleasure
appeared
in
average
jones
keen
eyes
that
rather
a
coincidence
he
said
two
of
us
from
the
old
hill
i
jones
of
had
a
cousin
in
your
class
carl
van
they
plunged
into
the
intimate
community
of
interest
which
is
the
peculiar
heritage
and
asset
of
the
small
old
college
presently
however
kirby
forehead
wrinkled
again
he
sat
silent
communing
with
himself
at
length
he
lifted
his
head
like
one
who
has
taken
a
resolution
you
made
a
good
guess
at
a
woman
in
the
case
he
said
and
you
call
this
a
coincidence
she
say
it
was
a
case
of
intuition
she
very
strong
on
intuition
and
superstition
there
was
a
mixture
of
tenderness
and
bitterness
in
his
tone
chance
brought
that
advertisement
to
her
eyes
a
she
dropped
stuck
through
it
or
something
of
the
sort
enough
for
her
nothing
would
do
but
that
i
should
chase
over
to
see
the
owl
building
bunch
at
that
maybe
her
hunch
was
right
it
brought
me
up
against
you
perhaps
you
can
help
me
what
are
you
a
sort
of
detective
only
on
the
average

drew
a
card
from

and
tendered

in

truth
by
me
here
a
proof
of
average
jones
took
the
slip
and
read
it
lost
necklace
of
curious
blue
stones
from
hotel
denton
night
of
august
reward
greater
than
value
of

for
return
to

no
questions
asked
reward
greater

commented
average
jones
a
sentimental
interest
then
will
you
take
the
case
returned
kirby
abruptly
at
least
i
look
into
it
replied
average
jones
come
to
the
hotel
then
and
lunch
with
me
and
i
open
up
the
whole
across
a
at
the
quiet

denton
kirby
unburdened
himself
you
know
all
that
necessary
about
me
the
the
other
party
in
the
matter
is
hale
she
a
young
widow
we
been
engaged
for
six
months
were
to
be
married
in
a
fortnight
now
she
insists
on
a
postponement
that
where
i
want
your
average
jones
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
really
kirby
quarrels
are
in
my
there
been
no
quarrel
we
as
much
engaged
now
as
ever
in
spite
of
the
return
of
the
ring
it
only
her
infern
her
superstition
that
caused
this
trouble
one
ca
blame
her
her
father
and
mother
were
both
killed
in
an
accident
after
some
sort
of
warning
the
first
thing
i
gave
her
after
our
engagement
was
a
necklace
of
these
stones
he
tapped
his
scarf
pin
that
i
selected
one
by
one
myself
they
beautiful
as
you
see
but
they
not
particularly
valuable
only
semiprecious
the
devil
of
it
is
that
they
the
subject
of
an
indian
legend
the
indians
and
mexicans
call
them
blue
fires
and
say
they
have
the
power
to
bind
and
loose
in
love
edna
has
been
out
in
that
country
she
naturally
high
strung
and
responsive
to
that
sort
of
thing
as
i
told
you
and
she
fairly
soaked
in
all
that
nonsense
to
make
it
worse
when
i
sent
them
to
her
i
wrote
that
that
a
dull
red
surged
up
under
the
tan
skin
that
as
long
as
the
fire
in
the
stones
burned
blue
for
her
my
heart
would
be
all
hers
now
the
necklace
is
gone
you
can
imagine
the
effect
on
a
woman
of
that
temperament
and
you
can
see
the
he
pointed
with
a
face
of
misery
to
the
solitaire
on
his
she
insisted
on
giving
this
back
says
that
a
woman
as
careless
as
she
proved
herself
ca
be
trusted
with
jewelry
and
she
hysterically
sure
that
misfortune
will
follow
us
for
ever
if
we
married
without
recovering
the
fool
necklace
so
she
begged
a
details
said
average
jones
crisply
she
here
at
this
hotel
has
a
small
suite
on
the
third
floor
came
down
from
her
home
in
central
new
york
to
meet
my
mother
whom
she
had
never
seen
mother
here
too
on
the
same
floor
night
before
last
hale
thought
she
heard
a
noise
in
her
outer
room
she
made
a
but
found
nothing
in
the
morning
when
she
got
up
about
ten
she
a
late
riser
the
necklace
was
where
had
it
been
left
on
a
stand
in
her
anything
else
taken
that
the
strange
part
of
it
her
purse
with
over
a
hundred
dollars
in
it
which
lay
under
the
necklace
was
does
she
usually
leave
valuables
around
in
that
casual
way
well
you
see
she
always
stayed
at
the
denton
and
she
felt
perfectly
secure
any
other
thefts
in
the
hotel
not
that
i
can
discover
but
one
of
the
guests
on
the
same
floor
with
hale
saw
a
fellow
acting
queerly
that
same
night
there
he
sits
yonder
at
that
table
i
ask
him
to
come
the
guest
an
elderly
man
already
interested
in
the
case
was
willing
enough
to
tell
all
he
knew
i
was
awakened
by
some
one
fumbling
at
my
door
and
making
a
clinking
noise
he
explained
i
called
out
nobody
answered
almost
immediately
i
heard
a
noise
across
the
hall
i
opened
my
door
a
man
was
fussing
at
the
keyhole
of
the
room
opposite
he
was
very
clumsy
i
said
that
your
room
he
did
even
look
at
me
in
a
moment
he
started
down
the
hallway
he
walked
very
fast
and
i
could
hear
him
muttering
to
himself
he
seemed
to
be
carrying
something
in
front
of
him
with
both
hands
it
was
his
keys
i
suppose
anyway
i
could
hear
it
clink
at
the
end
of
the
hall
he
stopped
turned
to
the
door
at
the
left
and
fumbled
at
the
keyhole
for
quite
a
while
i
could
bear
his
keys
clink
again
this
time
i
suppose
he
had
the
right
room
for
be
unlocked
it
and
went
in
i
listened
for
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
there
was
nothing
average
jones
looked
at
kirby
with
lifted
brows
of
inquiry
kirby
nodded
indicating
that
the
end
room
was
hales
how
was
the
man
dressed
asked
average
jones
grayish
and
he
was
tall
and
had
gray
many
thanks
now
kirby
will
you
take
me
to
see
hale
the
young
widow
received
them
in
her
she
was
of
the
slender
sensitive
type
of
womanhood
her
piquant
face
marred
by
the
evidences
of
sleeplessness
and
tears
to
average
jones
she
gave
her
confidence
at
once
people
usually
did
i
felt
sure
the
advertisement
would
bring
us
help
she
said
wistfully
now
i
feel
surer
than
faith
helps
the
worst
case
said
the
young
man
smiling
mr
kirby
tells
me
that
the
intruder
awakened
yes
and
i
a
very
heavy
sleeper
still
i
ca
say
positively
that
anything
definite
roused
me
it
was
rather
an
impression
of
some
being
about
i
came
out
of
my
bedroom
and
looked
around
the
outer
room
but
there
was
nobody
you
did
think
to
look
for
the
necklace
no
she
said
with
a
little
gasp
if
i
only
had
and
er
you
did
happen
to
hear
a
clinking
noise
did
you
after
he
got
into
the
room
he
put
the
key
up
would
he
suggested
kirby
you
assuming
that
he
had
a
of
course
he
had
a
key
the
guest
across
the
ball
saw
him
trying
it
on
the
other
doors
and
heard
it
clink
against
the
if
he
had
a
key
to
this
room
why
did
he
try
it
on
several
other
doors
first
propounded
average
jones
as
for
the
clinking
noise
in
which
i
a
good
deal
interested
may
i
look
at
your
key
hale
she
handed
it
to
him
he
tried
it
on
the
lock
outside
jabbing
at
the
metal
setting
the
resultant
sound
was
dull
and
wooden
not
much
of
the
clink
which
our
friend
describes
as
having
heard
is
it
he
remarked
then
how
could
he
get
into
my
room
cried
hale
are
you
sure
your
door
was
locked
certain
as
soon
as
i
missed
the
necklace
i
looked
at
the
that
was
in
the
morning
but
the
night
before
i
always
slip
the
spring
and
i
know
i
did
this
time
because
it
had
been
left
unsprung
so
that
kirby
mother
could
come
in
and
out
of
my
and
i
remember
springing
it
when
she
left
for
sometimes
these
locks
do
slipping
the
catch
back
average
jones
pressed
the
lever
down
there
was
a
click
but
the
ward
failed
to
slip
at
the
second
attempt
the
lock
worked
but
repeated
trials
proved
that
more
than
half
the
time
the
door
did
not
lock
so
observed
average
jones
i
think
we
may
dismiss
the
key
but
the
locked
door
this
morning
cried
hale
the
intruder
may
have
done
that
as
he
i
do
see
why
protested
kirby
in
a
tone
which
indicated
a
waning
faith
in
jones
by
way
of
confusing
the
trail
possibly
he
hoped
to
suggest
that
escaped
by
the
presumably
he
was
on
the
balcony
when
hale
came
out
into
this
as
he
spoke
average
jones
laid
a
hand
on
the
heavy
net
curtains
which
hung
before
the
balcony
window
instead
of
parting
them
however
he
stood
with
upturned
eyes
was
that
curtain
torn
before
yesterday
he
asked
hale
i
hardly
think
so
the
hotel
people
are
very
careful
in
the
of
the
jones
mounted
a
chair
with
scant
respect
for
the
upholstery
and
examined
the
damaged
drapery
descending
he
tugged
tentatively
at
the
other
curtain
first
with
his
right
hand
then
with
his
left
then
with
both
the
fabric
gave
a
little
at
the
last
test
jones
disappeared
through
the
window
when
he
returned
after
five
minutes
he
held
in
his
hand
some
scrapings
of
the
rusted
iron
which
formed
the
balcony
railing
you
a
mining
man
kirby
he
said
would
you
say
that
assayed
anything
kirby
examined
the
glinting
particles
gold
he
said
decisively
ah
then
the
necklace
rubbed
with
some
violence
against
the
railing
now
hale
how
long
were
you
awake
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
i
remember
that
a
continuous
rattling
of
wagons
below
kept
up
for
a
little
while
and
i
heard
one
of
the
drivers
call
out
something
about
taking
the
er
really
average
jones
became
suddenly
absorbed
in
his
seal
ring
he
turned
it
around
five
accurate
times
and
turned
it
back
an
equal
number
of
revolutions
did
he
er
get
any
answer
not
that
i
the
young
man
pondered
then
drew
a
chair
up
to
hale
escritoire
and
with
an
abrupt
excuse
me
helped
himself
to
pen
ink
and
paper
there
he
said
after
five
minutes
work
that
do
for
a
starter
you
see
he
added

the

of
his

broke
off
shaking

when

left

took
three
days
for

on
the
afternoon
of

said
the

and
went
out

jones
went
to
the
hotel
denton
and
spent
a
busy
morning
i
had
a
little
talk
with
the
hotel
servants
said
he
to
kirby
when
the
latter
called
to
make
inquiries
mr
henry
gillespie
of
locke
new
york
had
room
it
on
the
same
floor
with
hale
suite
at
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
he
had
only
one
piece
of
luggage
a
suitcase
marked
that
information
i
got
from
the
porter
he
left
his
room
in
perfect
order
except
for
one
thing
one
of
the
knobs
on
the
headboard
of
the
old
fashioned
bed
was
broken
off
short
he
mention
the
matter
to
the
hotel
what
do
you
make
of
that
it
was
a
stout
knob
only
a
considerable
effort
of
strength
exerted
in
a
peculiar
way
would
have
broken
it
as
it
was
broken
there
was
something
unusual
going
on
in
room
all
then
you
think
henry
gillespie
of
locke
new
york
is
our
no
said
average
jones
the
westerner
square
jaw
fell
why
not
because
there
no
such
person
as
henry
gillespie
of
locke
new
york
i
just
sent
there
and
found
three
stones
of
the
necklace
returned
on
the
current
of
advertised
appeal
one
was
brought
in
by
the
night
bartender
of
a
sporting
club
he
had
bought
it
from
a
man
who
had
picked
it
up
in
a
gutter
just
where
the
finder
could
remember
for
the
second
a
south
brooklyn
pawnbroker
demanded
and
received
an
exorbitant
reward
a
florist
in
greenwich
connecticut
contributed
the
last
with
that
patient
attention
to
detail
which
is
the
a
of
detective
work
average
jones
traced
down
these
apparently
incongruous
wanderings
of
the
stones
and
then
followed
them
all
back
to
hale
the
bartender
stone
offered
no
difficulties
the
setting
which
the
pawnbroker
brought
in
had
been
found
on
the
city
refuse
heap
by
a
scavenger
it
had
fallen
through
a
grating
into
the
hotel
cellar
and
had
been
swept
out
with
the
rubbish
to
go
to
the
municipal
the
apparent
mystery
of
the
florist
was
lucid
when
jones
found
that
the
hotel
exchanged
its
plants
with
the
greenwich
floral
company
his
roaming
eye
keen
for
every
detail
had
noticed
a
row
of
tubbed
azaleas
within
the
ground
enclosure
of
the
denton
recalling
this
to
mind
it
was
easy
for
the
to
surmise
that
the
gem
had
dropped
from
the
into
a
tub
which
was
shortly
after
shipped
to
the
florist
thus
it
was
apparent
that
the
three
jewels
had
been
stripped
from
the
necklace
by
forcible
contact
with
the
iron
rail
of
the
at
the
point
where
average
jones
had
found
the
color
of
precious
metal
the
stones
were
identified
by
kirby
from
a
peculiarity
in
the
setting
as
the
end
three
nearest
the
clasp
at
the
back
a
point
which
jones
carefully
noted
but
there
the
trail
ended
no
more
stones
came
in
for
three
weeks
average
jones
issued
advertisements
like
commands
the
advertisements
would
perhaps
have
struck
the
kirby
as
evidences
of
a
wavering
intellect
indeed
they
present
a
curious
and
incongruous
appearance
upon
the
page
of
average
jones
scrapbook
where
they
now
mark
a
successful
conclusion
the
first
reads
as
follows
oh

within
a

days
after
receiving
that
answer
jones
wired
to
kirby
probably
found
bring
hale
at
answer
kirby
answered
he
also
telegraphed
voluminously
to
his
who
had
returned
to
her
home
and
who
replied
that
she
would
leave
by
the
night
train
some
minutes
before
the
hour
the
pair
were
at
average
jones
office
kirby
fairly
pranced
with
impatience
while
they
were
kept
waiting
in
a
side
room
the
only
other
occupant
was
a
man
with
a
large
black
case
who
sat
at
the
window
in
a
slump
of
dejection
he
raised
his
head
for
a
moment
when
they
were
summoned
and
let
it
sag
down
again
as
they
left
average
jones
greeted
his
guests
cordially
their
first
questions
to
him
were
significant
of
the
masculine
and
feminine
differences
in
point
of
view
have
you
got
the
necklace
cried
hale
have
you
got
the
thief
queried
kirby
i
have
got
the
necklace
and
i
have
got
the
thief
announced
average
jones
but
i
think
i
got
the
man
who
got
the
did
the
thief
hand
it
over
to
him
demanded
kirby
are
you
conversant
with
the
baconian
system
of
thought
which
old
chips
used
to
preach
to
us
at
hamilton
countered
average
jones
forgotten
it
if
i
ever
knew
it
returned
kirby
so
i
infer
from
your
repeated
use
of
the
word
principle
an
admirable
principle
in
detective
work
is
that
we
should
learn
from
things
and
not
from
the
names
of
things
you
are
deluding
yourself
with
a
name
because
the
law
which
is
always
rigid
and
sometimes
stupid
says
that
a
man
who
takes
that
which
does
not
belong
to
him
is
a
thief
you
got
your
mind
fixed
on
the
name
and
the
idea
of
theft
if
i
had
gone
off
on
that
tack
i
should
have
the
interesting
privilege
of
introducing
to
you
harvey
greene
who
now
sits
in
the
outer
h
said
kirby
quickly
is
it
possible
that
that
old
boy
out
there
is
the
man
who
stole
it
is
not
interrupted
average
jones
with
emphasis
and
i
shall
ask
you
whatever
may
occur
to
guard
your
speech
from
offensive
expressions
of
that
sort
while
he
is
all
right
if
you
say
so
acquiesced
the
other
but
do
you
mind
telling
me
how
you
figure
out
a
man
traveling
under
an
alias
and
helping
himself
to
other
people
property
on
any
other
basis
than
that
he
a
thief
a
b
c
replied
average
jones
as
thus
a
thieves
do
wander
about
in
b
nor
take
necklaces
and
leave
purses
c
nor
strip
gems
violently
apart
and
scatter
them
like
largess
from
the
rest
of
the
alphabet
i
postpone
now
for
the
man
from
the
outer
room
entered
and
nervously
acknowledged
his
introduction
to
the
others
mr
greene
explained
jones
has
kindly
consented
to
help
clear
up
the
events
of
the
night
of
august
sixth
at
the
hotel
denton
and
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
shifted
his
gaze
to
the
newcomer
narrow
shoes
and
er
the
loss
of
er
hale
jeweled
the
boots
retracted
sharply
as
under
the
impulse
of
some
sudden
emotion
startled
surprise
for
example
what
cried
greene
in
obvious
amazement
i
do
know
anything
about
a
a
twinkle
of
satisfaction
appeared
at
the
corners
of
average
eyes
that
also
is
possible
he
admitted
if
you
permit
the
form
of
an
examination
when
you
came
to
the
hotel
denton
on
august
sixth
did
you
carry
the
same
suitcase
you
now
have
with
you
and
similarly
packed
as
nearly
as
thank
you
you
were
registered
under
the
name
of
henry
gillespie
the
other
voice
was
low
and
strained
as
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
for
good
reasons
of
your
own
for
which
same
reasons
you
left
the
hotel
quite
early
on
the
following
morning
your
business
compels
you
to
travel
a
great
deal
do
you
often
register
under
an
alias
yes
returned
the
other
his
face
twitching
but
not
always
in
a
large
city
and
a
strange
hotel
for
example
you
take
any
name
which
would
correspond
to
the
initials
on
your
case
but
in
a
small
town
where
you
were
known
you
be
obliged
to
register
under
your
real
name
of
harvey
greene
it
was
that
necessity
which
enabled
me
to
find
i
like
to
know
how
you
did
it
said
the
other
gloomily
from
the
drawer
of
his
desk
jones
produced
a
piece
of
netting
with
hooks
along
one
end
do
you
recognize
the
material
hale
he
asked
why
it
the
same
stuff
as
the
hotel
denton
curtains
is
it
she
asked
yes
said
average
jones
attaching
it
to
the
curtain
rod
at
the
side
door
now
will
you
jerk
that
violently
with
one
hand
it
will
tear
loose
wo
it
she
asked
that
just
what
it
will
do
try
the
fabric
ripped
from
the
hooks
as
she
jerked
you
remember
said
jones
that
your
curtain
was
torn
partly
across
and
not
ripped
from
the
hook
at
all
now
he
caught
the
netting
in
both
hands
and
tautened
it
sharply
it
began
to
part
awkward
he
said
yet
it
the
only
way
it
could
have
been
done
now
here
a
bedpost
exactly
like
the
one
in
room
occupied
by
greene
at
the
denton
kirby
you
a
powerful
man
can
you
break
that
knob
off
with
one
hand
he
wedged
the
post
firmly
in
a
chair
for
the
trial
the
bedpost
resisted
could
you
do
it
with
both
hands
he
asked
probably
if
i
could
get
a
hold
but
there
is
surface
enough
for
a
good
no
there
is
but
jones
coiled
a
rope
around
the
post
and
handed
the
end
to
kirby
he
pulled
sharply
the
knob
snapped
and
rolled
on
the
floor
q
said
kirby
but
it
does
mean
anything
to
does
it
let
me
recall
some
other
evidence
the
guest
who
saw
greene
in
the
hallway
thought
he
was
carrying
something
in
both
hands
the
milk
driver
who
hailed
him
on
the
balcony
noticed
that
he
gestured
awkwardly
with
both
hands
in
what
circumstances
would
a
man
use
both
hands
for
action
normally
performed
with
one
too
much
drink
hazarded
kirby
looking
dubiously
at
greene
who
had
been
following
jones
discourse
with
absorbed
attention
possibly
but
it
would
fit
this
physical
weakness
suggested
hale
rather
a
shrewd
suggestion
but
no
weakling
broke
off
that
bedpost
in
henry
gillespie
room
i
assumed
the
theory
that
the
phenomena
of
that
night
were
symptomatic
rather
than
accidental
therefore
i
set
out
to
find
in
what
other
places
the
mysterious
had
how
did
you
know
my
initials
really
were
asked
greene
the
porter
at
the
denton
had
seen
them
gillespie
suitcase
so
i
sent
out
loudly
printed
call
to
all
hotel
clerks
for
information
about
a
troublesome
he
handed
the
oh
you
hotel
men
advertisement
to
the
little
group
plenty
of
replies
came
you
have
if
i
may
say
it
without
offense
greene
an
unfortunate
reputation
among
hotel
proprietors
small
wonder
that
you
use
an
alias
from
the
hotel
carpathia
in
boston
i
got
a
response
more
valuable
than
i
had
dared
to
hope
an
guest
morton
garson
of
pillston
pennsylvania
greene
nodded
had
wrecked
his
room
and
left
behind
him
this
leaning
over
jones
pulled
clinking
from
the
a
fine
steel
chain
it
was
endless
and
some
twelve
feet
in
total
length
and
had
two
small
loops
about
a
foot
apart
hale
and
kirby
stared
at
it
in
speechless
surprise
yes
that
is
mine
said
greene
with
composure
i
left
it
because
it
had
ceased
to
be
serviceable
to
ah
that
very
interesting
said
average
jones
with
a
keen
glance
of
course
when
i
examined
it
and
found
no
locks
i
guessed
that
it
was
a
trick
chain
and
that
there
were
invisible
springs
in
the
wrist
but
why
should
any
one
chain
greene
to
his
bed
with
a
trick
chain
questioned
hale
whose
mind
had
been
working
swiftly
he
chained
himself
explained
jones
for
excellent
reasons
as
there
is
no
regular
trade
in
these
things
i
figured
that
he
probably
bought
it
from
some
juggler
whose
performance
had
given
him
the
idea
so
continued
jones
producing
a
specimen
of
his
advertisements
in
the
theatrical
publications
i
set
out
to
find
what
professional
had
sold
a
to
an
amateur
i
found
the
sale
had
been
made
at
marsfield
ohio
late
in
november
of
last
year
by
a
sam
termed
elusive
edwardes
on
november
of
last
year
harvey
greene
of
richmond
virginia
was
registered
at
the
principal
in
fact
the
only
decent
hotel
at
barsfield
i
wrote
to
him
and
here
he
yes
but
where
is
my
necklace
cried
hale
on
my
word
of
honor
madam
i
know
nothing
of
your
necklace
asserted
greene
with
a
painful
contraction
of
his
features
if
this
gentleman
can
throw
any
more
light
i
think
i
can
said
average
jones
do
you
remember
anything
of
that
night
events
after
you
broke
off
the
bedpost
and
left
your
room
the
meeting
with
a
guest
who
questioned
you
in
the
hall
for
example
nothing
not
a
thing
until
i
awoke
and
found
myself
on
the
awoke
cried
kirby
were
you
asleep
all
the
time
certainly
i
a
confirmed
worst
type
that
why
i
go
under
an
alias
that
why
i
got
the
trick
handcuff
chain
and
chained
myself
up
with
it
until
i
found
it
drove
me
fighting
crazy
in
my
sleep
when
i
could
break
away
that
why
i
slept
in
my
that
night
at
the
denton
there
was
a
red
light
in
the
hall
outside
and
any
light
particularly
a
colored
one
is
likely
to
set
me
going
i
probably
dreamed
i
was
escaping
from
a
locomotive
that
a
common
delusion
of
mine
and
sought
refuge
in
the
first
door
that
was
wait
a
minute
said
average
jones
you
er
say
that
you
are
er
peculiarly
susceptible
to
er
colored
mrs
hale
was
the
table
on
which
the
necklace
lay
in
line
with
any
light
outside
i
think
probably
with
the
direct
ray
of
an
electric
globe
shining
through
the
farther
then
greene
said
average
jones
the
glint
of
the
stones
undoubtedly
caught
your
eye
you
seized
on
the
necklace
and
carried
it
out
on
the
balcony
where
the
cool
air
or
the
hail
awakened
you
have
you
no
recollection
of
seeing
such
a
thing
not
the
faintest
then
he
must
have
dropped
it
to
the
ground
below
said
kirby
i
do
think
so
controverted
jones
slowly
mr
greene
must
have
been
clinging
to
it
tenaciously
when
it
swung
and
caught
against
the
railing
stripping
off
the
three
end
stones
if
the
whole
necklace
had
dropped
it
would
have
broken
up
fine
and
more
than
three
stones
would
have
returned
to
us
in
reply
to
the
advertisements
and
in
that
case
too
the
chances
against
the
end
stones
alone
returning
out
of
all
the
are
too
unlikely
to
be
considered
no
the
necklace
never
fell
to
the
it
certainly
did
remain
on
the
balcony
said
kirby
it
would
have
been
discovered
quite
so
assented
average
jones
we
getting
at
it
by
the
process
of
exclusion
the
necklace
did
fall
it
did
stay
therefore
he
looked
inquiringly
at
hale
it
returned
she
said
quickly
with
greene
added
average
jones
i
tell
you
cried
that
gentleman
vehemently
i
have
set
eyes
on
the
wretched
agreed
returned
average
jones
which
does
at
all
affect
the
point
i
wish
to
make
you
may
recall
greene
that
in
my
message
i
asked
you
to
pack
your
suitcase
exactly
as
it
was
when
you
left
the
hotel
with
it
on
the
morning
of
august
i
done
so
with
the
exception
of
the
conjurer
chain
of
including
the
you
had
on
that
night
i
assume
have
you
worn
it
since
no
it
hung
in
my
closet
until
yesterday
when
i
folded
it
to
pack
you
see
i
i
had
to
give
up
the
road
on
account
of
my
unhappy
then
permit
average
jones
stooped
to
the
case
drew
out
the
garment
and
thrust
his
hand
into
its
one
pocket
he
turned
to
hale
would
you
er
mind
er
leaning
over
a
bit
he
said
she
bent
her
dainty
head
then
gave
a
startled
cry
of
delight
as
the
young
man
with
a
swift
motion
looped
over
her
shoulders
a
chain
of
living
blue
fires
which
gleamed
and
glinted
in
the
sunlight
they
were
there
all
the
time
she
exclaimed
and
you
knew
guessed
it
he
corrected
by
figuring
out
that
they
could
well
be
elsewhere
unless
on
the
untenable
hypothesis
that
our
friend
greene
here
was
a
which
only
goes
to
prove
said
kirby
soberly
that
evidence
may
be
a
mighty
deceptive
which
only
goes
to
prove
amended
average
jones
that
there
no
fire
even
the
bluest
without
traceable
chapter
vii
the
thing
is
a
fake
declared
bertram
he
slumped
heavily
into
a
chair
and
scowled
at
average
jones
desk
whereon
he
had
just
tossed
a
sheet
of
paper
his
usually
impeccable
hair
was
tousled
his
trousers
evinced
a
distinct
tendency
to
bag
at
the
knees
and
his
coat
was
undeniably
wrinkled
that
the
elegant
and
flawless
dilettante
of
the
cosmic
club
should
have
come
forth
at
eleven
of
a
morning
in
such
a
state
of
comparative
disreputability
argued
an
upheaval
of
mind
little
short
of
phenomenal
a
fake
he
reiterated
i
spent
a
night
of
riot
and
ruin
over
it
you
almost
destroyed
a
young
and
innocent
mind
with
your
infernal
palimpsest
you
would
have
it
returned
average
jones
with
a
smile
and
i
seem
to
recall
a
lofty
intimation
on
your
part
that
there
never
was
a
cipher
so
tough
but
what
you
could
rope
throw
bind
and
tie
a
pink
ribbon
on
its
tail
in
record
cipher
yes
returned
the
other
bitterly
that
thing
is
a
cipher
it
an
alphabetical
riot
maybe
he
added
hopefully
there
was
some
mistake
in
my
copy
look
for
yourself
said
average
jones
handing
him
the
original
it
was
a
singular
document
this
problem
in
letters
which
had
come
to
light
up
the
gloom
of
a
november
day
for
average
jones
a
stiffish
sheet
of
paper
ornamented
on
one
side
with
color
prints
of
alluring
spinners
and
on
the
other
inscribed
with
an
appeal
in
print
its
original
vehicle
was
an
envelope
bearing
a
stamp
and
addressed
in
typewriting
william
robinson
the
caronia
broadway
and
evenside
new
york
city
the
advertisement
on
the
reverse
of
the
sheet
ran
as
follows
anglers
when
you
are
looking
for
baits
that
catch
fish
do
you
see
these
spinners
in
the
store
where
you
buy
tackle
you
will
find
here
twelve
baits
every
one
of
which
has
a
record
and
has
literally
caught
tons
of
fish
we
call
them
the
surety
we
want
you
to
try
them
for
casting
and
trolling
these
next
two
months
because
all
varieties
of
bass
are
particularly
savage
in
striking
these
baits
late
in
the
season
dealers
you
want
your
customers
to
have
these
shoemaker
surety
baits
that
catch
fish
this
case
will
sell
itself
empty
over
and
over
again
for
every
bait
is
a
and
they
catch
fish
we
want
you
to
put
in
one
of
these
cases
so
that
the
anglers
will
not
be
disappointed
and
have
to
wait
for
baits
to
be
ordered
it
will
be
furnished
free
charges
prepaid
with
your
order
for
the
dozen
bait
it
contains
the
peculiar
feature
of
the
communication
was
that
it
was
profusely
with
tiny
projections
evidently
made
by
thrusting
a
pin
in
from
the
side
which
bore
the
illustrations
the
perforations
were
liberally
scattered
most
though
not
all
of
them
transfixed
certain
letters
accepting
this
as
indicative
bertram
had
copied
out
all
the
letters
thus
distinguished
with
the
following
cryptic
result

the

all
right
growled
bertram
tell
me
again
how
you
came
by
robinson
came
here
twice
and
missed
me
yesterday
i
got
the
note
from
him
which
you
seen
with
the
enclosure
which
has
so
threatened
your
reason
you
know
the
rest
perhaps
you
have
done
well
to
study
the
note
for
clues
to
the
other
something
in
his
friend
tone
made
bertram
glance
up
suspiciously
let
me
see
the
note
he
demanded
average
jones
handed
it
to
him
there
was
no
stamp
on
it
it
had
been
left
by
the
writer
it
was
addressed
in
rather
scrawly
chirography
to
a
jones
and
read
the
caronia
jones
astor
court
temple
i
have
tried
unsuccessfully
to
see
you
twice
enclosed
you
will
find
the
reason
please
read
through
it
carefully
then
i
am
sure
you
will
see
and
help
me
money
is
no
object
i
will
call
at
noon
respectfully
william
robinson
well
i
see
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
in
that
observed
bertram
nothing
inquired
average
jones
bertram
read
the
message
again
of
course
the
man
is
rattled
obvious
in
his
handwriting
also
he
has
inverted
one
sentence
in
his
haste
and
said
through
it
instead
of
it
through
otherwise
it
ordinary
it
must
be
vanity
that
keeps
you
from
eyeglasses
bert
average
jones
observed
with
a
sigh
well
i
afraid
i
set
you
on
the
wrong
track
myself
bertram
lifted
an
eyebrow
with
an
effort
meaning
i
suppose
that
you
on
the
tight
and
have
solved
the
cipher
be
jiggered
you
were
right
in
your
opening
remark
there
any
cipher
if
you
read
robinson
note
correctly
and
if
you
had
the
advantage
of
working
on
the
original
of
the
advertisement
as
i
have
you
undoubtedly
have
noticed
at
once
thank
you
murmured
bertram
that
fully
of
the
do
touch
any
letters
at
then
we
should
have
taken
the
letters
which
lie
between
the
holes
no
the
letters
do
count
it
the
punctures
force
your
eyes
to
consider
those
alone
and
you
will
see
that
the
holes
themselves
form
letters
and
words
read
through
it
carefully
as
robins
he
held
the
paper
up
to
the
light
bertram
made
out
in
straggling
characters
formed
in
skeleton
the
perforations
this
legend
all
points
to
you
take
the
short
cut
death
is
easier
than
some
things
whew
that
a
cheery
little
greeting
remarked
bertram
but
why
did
friend
robinson
point
it
out
definitely
in
his
letter
wanted
to
test
my
capacity
perhaps
or
it
may
have
been
simply
that
he
was
too
frightened
and
rattled
to
know
just
what
he
was
know
anything
of
him
only
what
the
directory
tells
and
directories
do
deal
in
really
intimate
details
of
biography
you
know
there
quite
an
assortment
of
william
robinsons
but
the
one
who
lives
at
the
caronia
appears
to
be
a
commission
merchant
on
pearl
street
as
the
caronia
is
one
of
the
most
elegant
and
quite
the
most
enormous
of
those
small
cities
within
themselves
which
we
call
apartment
houses
i
take
it
that
robinson
is
and
probably
married
you
can
ask
him
yourself
if
you
like
he
due
any
moment
promptly
as
befitted
a
business
man
william
robinson
arrived
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
he
was
a
citizen
of
who
would
have
been
wholly
ordinary
save
for
one
peculiarity
in
a
room
more
than
temperately
cool
he
was
sweating
profusely
and
that
despite
the
fact
that
his
light
overcoat
was
on
his
arm
not
polite
perspiration
be
it
noted
such
as
would
have
been
excusable
in
a
gentleman
of
his
pale
and
sleek
plumpness
but
sweat
the
globules
whereof
gathered
in
the
grayish
hollows
under
his
eyes
and
assailed
not
without
effect
the
glistening
expanse
of
his
tall
white
collar
he
darted
a
glance
at
bertram
then
turned
to
average
jones
i
had
hoped
for
a
private
interview
he
said
in
a
high
piping
voice
mr
bertram
is
my
friend
and
business
very
good
you
you
have
read
it
then
then
then
the
visitor
fumble
with
nerveless
fingers
at
his
tightly
buttoned
coat
it
resisted
his
efforts
suddenly
with
a
snarl
of
exasperation
he
dragged
violently
at
the
lapel
tearing
the
button
outright
from
the
cloth
look
what
i
have
done
he
said
staring
stupidly
for
a
moment
at
the
button
which
had
shot
across
the
room
then
to
the
amazed
consternation
of
the
others
he
burst
into
tears
average
jones
pushed
a
chair
behind
him
while
bertram
brought
him
a
glass
of
water
he
gulped
out
his
thanks
and
mastering
himself
after
a
moment
effort
drew
a
paper
from
his
inner
pocket
which
he
placed
on
the
desk
it
was
a
certified
check
for
one
hundred
dollars
made
payable
to
jones
there
the
rest
of
a
thousand
ready
if
you
can
help
me
he
said
we
talk
of
that
later
said
the
prospective
beneficiary
sit
tight
until
you
able
to
answer
able
now
piped
the
other
in
his
shrill
voice
i
ashamed
of
myself
gentlemen
but
the
strain
i
been
under
when
you
heard
my
story
just
a
moment
please
interrupted
average
jones
let
me
get
at
this
my
own
any
way
you
like
returned
the
visitor
good
now
what
is
it
that
points
to
you
i
do
know
any
more
than
what
are
the
things
that
are
worse
than
death
robinson
shook
his
head
i
have
the
slightest
notion
in
the
nor
of
the
cut
which
you
are
advised
to
take
i
suppose
it
means
he
paused
for
a
moment
they
ca
drive
me
to
that
unless
they
drive
me
crazy
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
under
his
eyes
breathing
hard
who
are
they
robinson
shook
his
head
in
the
next
question
the
tone
altered
and
became
more
insistent
have
you
ever
called
in
a
doctor
robinson
only
once
in
five
years
that
was
when
my
nerves
broke
down
under
when
you
do
call
in
a
doctor
is
it
your
habit
to
conceal
your
symptoms
from
him
of
course
not
i
see
what
you
mean
jones
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
as
i
hope
to
be
saved
from
this
persecution
i
do
know
any
more
than
yourself
what
it
then
er
i
am
er
to
believe
replied
jones
drawling
as
he
always
did
when
interest
in
his
mind
was
verging
on
excitement
that
a
simple
blind
threat
like
this
er
without
any
backing
from
your
own
conscience
er
could
shake
you
er
as
this
has
done
why
robinson
the
thing
er
may
be
er
only
a
raw
practical
but
the
others
cried
the
visitor
his
face
changed
and
fell
i
believe
i
am
going
crazy
he
groaned
i
did
tell
you
about
the
diving
into
his
overcoat
pocket
he
drew
out
a
packet
of
letters
which
he
placed
on
the
desk
with
a
sort
of
dismal
flourish
read
those
he
cried
average
jones
ran
rapidly
over
the
eight
envelopes
with
one
exception
each
bore
the
imprint
of
some
firm
name
made
familiar
by
extensive
advertising
all
the
envelopes
were
of
softish
manila
paper
varying
in
grade
and
hue
under
stamps
which
is
the
first
of
the
series
he
asked
it
is
among
those
unfortunately
it
was
lost
by
a
stupid
mistake
pin
and
pin
yes
where
i
cut
open
the
envelope
wait
a
moment
you
say
you
cut
it
open
all
these
being
postage
must
have
come
unsealed
was
the
first
different
yes
it
had
a
stamp
it
was
a
circular
announcement
of
the
encyclopedia
in
a
sealed
envelope
there
was
a
pin
bent
over
the
fold
of
the
letter
so
you
could
help
but
notice
it
its
head
was
stuck
through
the
blank
part
of
the
circular
leading
from
it
were
three
very
small
pins
arranged
as
a
pointer
to
the
do
you
remember
the
message
could
i
forget
it
it
was
pricked
out
quite
small
on
the
blank
fold
of
the
paper
it
said
the
most
of
your
freedom
your
time
is
short
call
at
general
delivery
main
for
your
warning
i
you
went
there
the
next
and
found
an
ordinary
sealed
envelope
addressed
in
pinpricks
connected
by
pencil
lines
the
address
was
scrawly
but
quite
well
what
did
it
contain
a
commitment
blank
to
an
insane
average
jones
absently
drew
out
his
handkerchief
elaborately
whisked
from
his
coat
sleeve
an
imaginary
speck
of
dust
and
smiled
benignantly
where
the
dust
was
supposed
to
have
been
insane
asylum
he
murmured
was
er
the
blank
er
filled
in
only
partly
my
name
was
pricked
in
and
there
was
a
specification
of
dementia
from
drug
habit
with
suicidal
with
a
quick
signal
unseen
by
the
visitor
average
jones
opened
the
way
to
bertram
who
in
wide
range
of
experience
and
study
had
once
specialized
upon
abnormal
mental
phenomena
pardon
me
that
gentleman
put
in
gently
has
there
ever
been
any
dementia
in
your
family
not
as
far
as
i
or
suicidal
mania
all
my
people
have
died
respectably
in
their
beds
declared
the
visitor
with
some
vehemence
once
more
if
i
may
venture
have
you
ever
been
addicted
to
any
drug
never
now
average
jones
took
up
the
examination
will
you
tell
me
of
any
enemy
who
would
have
reason
to
persecute
you
i
have
an
enemy
in
the
you
fortunate
returned
the
other
smiling
but
surely
some
time
in
your
career
business
rivalry
family
alienation
any
one
of
a
thousand
causes
no
answered
the
harassed
man
not
for
me
my
business
runs
smoothly
my
relations
are
mostly
dead
i
have
no
friends
and
no
enemies
my
wife
and
i
live
alone
and
all
we
ask
he
added
in
a
sudden
outburst
of
almost
childish
resentment
is
to
be
left
the
inquisitor
gaze
returned
to
the
packet
of
letters
you
complained
to
the
authorities
and
risk
the
publicity
returned
robinson
with
a
shudder
well
give
me
over
night
with
these
oh
and
i
may
want
to
you
presently
you
be
at
home
thank
you
good
now
said
average
jones
to
bertram
as
their
caller
plump
back
disappeared
this
looks
pretty
queer
to
me
what
did
you
think
of
our
friend
scared
but
straight
was
bertram
verdict
glad
to
hear
it
that
my
idea
too
let
have
a
look
at
the
material
we
already
got
the
opening
threat
and
the
general
delivery
which
shows
at
least
that
it
is
a
case
of
somebody
in
the
apartment
house
tampering
with
the
not
only
that
it
a
dodge
to
find
out
whether
he
got
the
first
message
people
do
always
read
advertisements
even
when
sealed
as
the
first
one
was
therefore
our
mysterious
persecutor
says
just
have
robinson
prove
it
to
me
if
he
did
get
the
first
message
by
calling
for
the
second
then
after
a
lapse
of
time
he
himself
goes
to
the
general
delivery
asks
for
a
letter
for
william
robinson
finds
it
gone
and
is
yes
and
he
be
sure
then
that
robinson
would
go
through
all
the
mailed
ads
with
a
comb
after
that
but
why
the
just
to
disguise
his
hand
possibly
it
a
fairly
effectual
why
did
he
address
the
envelope
that
way
then
the
address
would
be
legible
against
the
white
background
of
the
paper
inside
on
the
other
hand
if
he
addressed
all
his
envelopes
by
pinpricks
filled
in
with
pencil
lines
the
people
might
get
curious
and
look
into
one
sending
threats
through
the
mail
is
a
serious
average
jones
ran
over
the
letter
again

bertram
feebly
what
has
a

i
should
say
the

confirmed
bertram
it
falls
and
average
jones
pushed
the
collection
of
advertisements
aside
and
returned
to
the
opening
phase
of
the
problem
the
circular
which
robinson
had
mailed
him
so
long
after
that
bertram
hardly
recognized
it
as
a
response
to
his
last
remark
the
investigator
drawled
out
not
such
er
impenetrable
darkness
in
fact
er
eureka
or
words
to
that
effect
bert
when
does
the
bass
season
end

hereabouts
i
the

carried

advises
the

be
using
after
the

bert
it
a
pity
i
ca
waggle
my
waggle
your
ears
for
heaven
sake
why
because
then
i
be
such
a
perfect
jackass
that
i
could
win
medals
at
a
show
i
ought
to
have
guessed
it
at
first
glance
from
the
fact
that
the
advertisement
could
well
have
been
mailed
to
robinson
originally
why
not
because
he
not
in
the
business
and
the
advertisement
is
obviously
addressed
to
the
retail
trade
do
you
remember
it
offers
a
showcase

does
a

in

jones
held
the

the

curled

and
dropped
off
beneath
it
were
the
remains
of
a
small
portion
of
a
former
postmark
i
thought
so
murmured
average

remailed
exclaimed
bertram
remailed
corroborated
his

i
expect
we
find
the

the

one
he
submitted
the
envelopes
to
the
steam
bath
each
of
them
as
the

was
peeled
off
exhibited
more
or
less
fragmentary
signs
of
a
previous
cancellation
careless
work
criticized
average
jones
every
bit
of
the
mark
should
have
been
removed
instead
of
trusting
to
the
second
stamp
to
cover
what
little
was
left
by
shifting
it
a
bit
toward
the
center
of
the
envelope
look
you
can
see
on
this
one
where
the
original
stamp
was
peeled
off
on
this
the
traces
of
erasure
are
plain
enough
that
why
manila
paper
was
selected
it
easier
to
erase
is
robinson
faking
asked
bertram
or
has
some
one
been
rifling
his
that
would
mean
an
accomplice
in
the
house
which
would
be
dangerous
i
think
it
was
done
at
longer
range
as
for
the
question
of
our
faking
in
his
claim
of
complete
ignorance
of
all
this
i
propose
to
find
that
out
right
drawing
the
telephone
to
him
he
called
the
caronia
apartments
thus
it
was
that
william
robinson
for
two
unhappy
minutes
profoundly
feared
that
at
last
he
had
really
lost
his
mind
this
is
the
conversation
in
which
he
found
himself
implicated
hello
robinson
this
is

you
hear

yes

what
is

i
beg
your

said
average
jones
in
a
swift
aside
to

certainly
would
know
the
more
obscure
latin
of
the

robinson
is
there
in
all
your

any
person
who
never
goes
out
without
an
attendant
take
time
to
think
why
why
why
stuttered
the
appalled
subject
of
this
examination
and
fell
into
silence
from
the
depths
of
the
silence
he
presently
exhumed
the
following
i
did
have
a
paralytic
cousin
who
always
went
out
in
a
wheeled
chair
but
she
and
there
no
one
else
no
i
quite
that
all
thank
heaven
what
was
that
about
an
attendant
inquired
bertram
as
his
friend
replaced
the
receiver
oh
i
just
a
hunch
that
the
sender
of
those
messages
does
go
out
insane
or
it
does
rather
look
like
delusional
as
nearly
as
imperfect
humanity
may
average
jones
appeared
to
be
smiling
indulgently
at
the
end
of
his
own
nose
dare
say
you
right
er
in
part
bert
but
i
also
a
hunch
that
our

is
himself

delusion

well
as
the

wish
you

worked
at

threw
it
down

disgust
this

practice

here

cleverer
with

afterward
the

of
the
face
was
mere
wreckage
the
chin
quivering
and
fallen
from
the
fine
lines
of
the
nose
coarsened
by
the
spreading
nostrils
the
mouth
showing
both
the
soft
contours
of
sensuality
and
the
hard
fine
line
of
craft
and
cruelty
the
man
eyes
were
unholy
they
stared
straight
before
him
and
were
dead
with
his
entrance
there
was
infused
in
the
atmosphere
a
sense
of
something
venomous
mr
alden
honeywell
said
average
jones
the
voice
had
refinement
and
calm
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
william
the
head
turned
slowly
to
his
right
shoulder
then
back
his
eyes
remained
rigid
why
the
man
blind
burst
out
robins
in
his
piping
voice
blind
echoed
bertram
did
you
know
this
average
of
course
the
showed
it
and
the
letter
mailed
to
robinson
at
the
general
delivery
which
if
you
remember
had
the
address
penciled
in
from
when
you
have
quite
done
discussing
my
personal
misfortune
said
honeywell
patiently
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
which
is
william
i
am
returned
the
owner
of
that
name
and
do
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
why
you
hound
me
with
your
hellish
that
is
not
william
robinson
voice
said
the
blind
man
who
are
you
william
not
william
honeywell
robinson
no
william
hunter
then
why
am
i
brought
here
to
make
a
statement
for
publication
in
morning
newspaper
returned
average
jones
crisply
statement
is
this
a
yellow
journal
trap
as
a
courtesy
to
robinson
i
explain
how
long
have
you
lived
in
the
caronia
robinson
about
eight
then
some
three
or
four
months
before
you
moved
in
another
william
robinson
lived
there
for
a
short
time
his
middle
name
was
honeywell
he
is
a
cousin
and
an
object
of
great
solicitude
to
this
gentleman
here
in
fact
he
is
or
will
be
the
chief
witness
against
honeywell
in
his
effort
to
break
the
famous
holden
honeywell
will
disposing
of
some
ten
million
dollars
am
i
right
honeywell
thus
far
replied
the
blind
man
composedly
five
years
ago
william
honeywell
robinson
became
addicted
to
a
patent
headache
it
ended
as
such
habits
do
in
insanity
he
was
confined
two
years
suffering
from
psychasthenia
with
suicidal
melancholia
and
delusion
of
persecution
then
he
was
released
cured
but
with
a
supersensitive
mental
then
the
messages
were
intended
to
drive
him
out
of
his
mind
again
said
bertram
in
sudden
enlightenment
what
a
devil
either
that
or
to
impel
him
by
suggestion
to
suicide
or
to
revert
to
the
headache
powders
which
would
have
meant
the
asylum
again
anything
to
put
him
out
of
the
way
or
to
make
his
testimony
incompetent
for
the
will
contest
so
when
the
returned
from
europe
a
year
ago
our
friend
honeywell
here
in
some
way
located
him
at
the
caronia
he
matured
his
little
scheme
through
a
letter
broker
who
deals
with
the
rag
and
refuse
collectors
he
got
all
the
mail
from
the
caronia
meantime
william
honeywell
robinson
had
moved
away
and
as
chance
would
have
it
william
hunter
robinson
moved
in
receiving
the
pinprick
letters
which
had
they
reached
their
goal
would
probably
have
produced
the
desired
if
they
drove
a
sane
man
nearly
crazy
what
would
they
have
done
to
one
whose
mind
was
quite
right
cried
the
wronged
robinson
but
since
honeywell
is
blind
said
bertram
how
could
he
see
to
erase
the
cancellations
ah
that
what
i
asked
myself
obviously
he
could
he
have
to
get
that
done
for
him
presumably
he
get
some
stranger
to
do
it
that
why
i
advertised
for
a
professional
eraser
who
was
experienced
judging
that
it
would
fetch
the
person
who
had
done
honeywell
is
there
any
such
thing
as
a
professional
envelope
eraser
asked
bertram
no
so
a
person
of
experience
in
this
line
would
be
almost
unique
i
was
sure
to
find
the
right
one
if
he
or
she
saw
my
advertisement
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
turned
out
to
be
an
unimaginative
young
woman
who
has
told
me
all
about
her
former
employment
with
honeywell
apparently
with
no
thought
that
there
was
anything
strange
in
erasing
cancellations
from
hundreds
of
envelopes
for
honeywell
was
cautious
enough
not
to
confine
her
to
the
robinson
mail
alone
and
then
pasting
on
stamps
to
remail
you
appear
to
have
followed
out
my
moves
with
some
degree
of
acumen
er
jones
said
the
blind
schemer
suavely
yet
i
might
not
have
solved
your
processes
easily
if
you
had
not
made
one
rather
if
you
will
pardon
me
stupid
for
the
first
time
the
man
bloated
lips
shook
his
evil
pride
of
intellectuality
was
stung
you
lie
he
said
hastily
i
do
not
make
no
well
have
it
as
you
will
the
point
that
you
are
to
sign
here
a
statement
which
i
shall
read
to
you
before
these
witnesses
announcing
for
publication
the
withdrawal
of
your
contest
for
the
honeywell
and
if
i
decline
the
painful
necessity
will
be
mine
of
turning
over
these
instructive
documents
to
the
united
states
postal
authorities
but
not
before
giving
them
to
the
newspapers
how
would
you
look
in
court
in
view
of
this
attempt
to
murder
a
fellow
man
reason
honeywell
had
now
gained
his
composure
you
are
right
he
assented
you
seem
to
have
a
singular
faculty
for
being
right
be
careful
it
does
not
fail
you
thank
you
returned
average
jones
now
you
will
listen
please
all
of
he
read
the
brief
document
placed
it
before
the
blind
man
and
set
a
pin
between
his
finger
and
thumb
sign
there
he
said
honeywell
smiled
as
he
pricked
in
his
name
for
identification
i
suppose
he
said
am
i
to
assign
no
cause
to
the
newspapers
for
my
sudden
action
a
twinkle
of
malice
appeared
in
average
jones
eye
i
would
suggest
waning
mental
acumen
he
said
the
blind
man
winced
palpably
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
that
is
the
second
time
you
have
taunted
me
on
that
kindly
tell
me
my
average
jones
led
him
to
the
door
and
opened
it
your
mistake
he
drawled
as
he
sped
his
parting
guest
into
the
grasp
of
a
waiting
attendant
was
er
in
not
remembering
that
er
you
must
fish
for
bass
in
chapter
viii
big
print
in
the
cosmic
club
algernon
spofford
was
a
figure
of
distinction
amidst
the
varied
curious
eccentric
brilliant
and
even
slightly
unbalanced
minds
which
made
the
organization
unique
his
was
the
only
wholly
stolid
and
stupid
one
club
tradition
declared
that
he
had
been
admitted
solely
for
the
beneficent
purpose
of
keeping
the
more
egotistic
members
in
a
permanent
and
pleasing
glow
of
superiority
he
was
very
rich
but
otherwise
quite
harmless
in
an
access
of
unappreciated
cynicism
average
jones
had
once
suggested
to
him
as
a
device
for
his
newly
acquired
rocks
et
praeterea
but
the
praeterea
nihil
was
something
less
than
fair
to
spofford
with
whom
it
was
not
strictly
a
case
of
nothing
further
besides
his
rocks
ambition
the
vice
of
great
souls
burned
within
he
longed
to
distinguish
himself
in
the
line
of
endeavor
of
his
friend
jones
and
was
prone
to
proffer
suggestions
hints
and
even
advice
to
the
great
tribulation
of
the
recipient
hence
it
was
with
misgiving
that
the
opened
the
door
of
his
sanctum
to
spofford
on
a
harsh
december
noon
but
the
misgivings
were
supplanted
by
pleased
surprise
when
the
caller
laid
in
his
hand
a
clipping
from
a
small
country
town
paper
to
this
effect
ransom
lost
lad
from
harwick
not
drowned
or
harmed
retained
for
ransom
safe
and
sound
to
parents
for
write
mortimer
morley
general
delivery
thought
that
catch
you
chuckled
spofford
in
great
see
into
this
i
says
to
myself
he
do
i
explain
somethin
to
that
ay
average
jones
looked
from
the
advertisement
to
the
vacuous
smile
of
algernon
spofford
oh
you
explain
will
you
he
said
softly
well
the
thing
i
like
to
have
explained
is
come
over
here
to
the
window
a
minute
will
you
algy
spofford
came
and
gazed
down
upon
a
dispiriting
area
of
street
and
bedraggled
wayfarers
see
that
office
building
across
the
way
pursued
average
jones
what
would
you
do
if
coming
in
here
at
midnight
you
were
to
see
rats
ooze
out
of
that
building
and
disperse
about
their
business
i
i
quit
said
the
startled
promptly
that
the
obvious
solution
retorted
but
my
question
was
intended
to
elicit
a
brand
of
spofford
contemplated
the
building
uneasily
i
do
know
what
up
to
average
he
complained
is
it
a
catch
no
it
a
test
case
what
would
you
do
i
think
it
was
queer
answered
spofford
with
profound
conviction
you
getting
on
said
jones
tartly
and
next
ay
how
do
i
know
what
you
devilin
me
this
way
for
you
would
call
a
policeman
no
said
spofford
staring
you
would
hustle
around
and
central
bosh
yet
if
any
one
told
you
you
had
the
sense
a
policeman
you
resent
of
course
i
would
well
jimmy
mccue
the
night
special
who
patrols
past
the
corner
saw
that
very
thing
happen
a
few
nights
ago
at
the
sterriter
building
knowing
that
rats
do
go
out
at
midnight
for
a
saunter
two
dozen
strong
he
began
to
suspect
what
growled
spofford
that
there
must
be
some
abnormal
cause
for
so
abnormal
a
proceeding
think
now
i
heard
of
rats
leavin
a
sinkin
ship
the
building
might
have
been
sinkin
suggested
the
visitor
hopefully
is
that
the
best
you
can
do
i
give
you
one
more
i
know
said
spofford
a
on
my
soul
declared
average
jones
gazing
at
his
with
increased
interest
you
the
most
remarkable
specimen
of
inverted
mentality
i
ever
encountered
think
a
cat
habitually
rounds
up
two
dozen
rats
and
then
chivies
out
into
the
street
for
sport
mccue
did
have
any
cat
theory
he
figured
that
when
rats
come
out
of
a
place
that
way
the
place
is
afire
so
he
turned
in
an
alarm
and
saved
a
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollar
umph
grunted
spofford
well
what
that
got
to
do
with
the
advertisement
i
brought
you
nothing
in
the
world
directly
i
merely
trying
to
figure
out
in
my
own
way
how
a
mind
like
yours
could
see
under
the
surface
print
into
the
really
interesting
peculiarity
of
this
clipping
now
i
know
that
your
mind
did
do
anything
of
the
sort
come
on
now
algy
who
sent
this
to
you
cousin
of
mine
up
in
harwick
i
wish
you
were
so
sharp
average
i
used
to
visit
in
harwick
so
they
asked
me
to
get
you
interested
in
bailey
prentice
case
he
the
lost
you
done
it
now
tell
me
all
you
spofford
produced
a
letter
which
gave
the
outlines
of
the
case
bailey
prentice
disappearance
it
was
set
forth
was
the
lesser
of
two
simultaneous
phenomena
which
violently
jarred
the
somnolent
new
england
village
of
harwick
from
its
wonted
calm
the
greater
was
the
harwick
at
on
the
night
of
december
twelfth
the
streets
being
full
of
people
coming
from
the
moving
picture
show
there
was
a
startling
concussion
from
the
overhanging
clouds
and
the
astounded
populace
saw
a
ball
of
flame
plunging
earthward
to
the
northwest
of
the
town
and
waxing
in
intensity
as
it
fell
darkness
succeeded
but
within
a
minute
a
lurid
radiance
rose
and
spread
in
the
night
the
aerial
bolt
had
gone
crashing
through
an
old
barn
on
the
tuxall
place
setting
it
afire
bailey
prentice
was
among
the
very
few
who
did
not
go
to
the
fire
taken
in
connection
with
the
fact
that
he
was
fourteen
years
old
and
very
thoroughly
a
boy
this
in
itself
was
phenomenal
in
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
however
his
absence
was
not
noted
but
when
on
the
following
morning
the
reverend
peter
prentice
going
up
to
call
his
son
found
the
boy
room
empty
and
the
bed
untouched
the
second
sensation
of
the
day
was
launched
bailey
prentice
had
quite
simply
vanished
some
one
offered
the
theory
that
playing
truant
from
the
house
while
his
father
was
engaged
in
work
below
stairs
he
had
been
overwhelmed
and
perhaps
wholly
consumed
by
a
detached
fragment
from
the
fiery
visitant
this
picturesque
suggestion
found
many
supporters
until
on
the
afternoon
of
december
fourteenth
a
coat
and
waistcoat
were
found
on
the
seashore
a
mile
north
of
the
village
the
reverend
prentice
identified
the
clothes
as
his
son
searching
parties
covered
the
beach
for
miles
looking
for
the
body
preparations
were
made
for
the
funeral
services
when
a
new
and
astonishing
factor
was
injected
into
the
situation
an
advertisement
received
by
mail
from
new
york
with
stamps
affixed
to
the
copy
to
pay
for
its
insertion
appeared
in
the
local
paper
and
here
the
advertisement
concluded
algernon
spofford
indicating
the
slip
of
paper
which
he
had
turned
over
to
average
jones
and
if
you
are
going
up
to
harwick
and
need
help
there
why
i
got
time
to
thank
you
algy
replied
average
jones
gravely
but
i
think
better
stay
here
in
case
anything
turns
up
at
this
end
suppose
he
added
with
an
inspiration
you
trace
this
mortimer
morley
through
the
general
all
right
agreed
spofford
innocently
satisfied
with
this
errand
lem
me
know
if
anything
good
turns
average
jones
took
train
for
harwick
and
within
a
few
hours
was
rubbing
his
hands
over
an
open
fire
in
the
parsonage
whose
stiff
and
cheerless
aspect
bespoke
the
lack
of
a
woman
humanizing
touch
for
the
reverend
prentice
was
a
widower
overwrought
with
anxiety
and
strain
the
clergyman
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
coat
began
a
hurried
inconsequential
narrative
broke
off
tried
again
fell
into
an
inextricable
confusion
of
words
and
dropping
his
head
in
his
hands
cried
i
ca
tell
you
it
is
all
a
hopeless
come
said
the
younger
man
encouragingly
comfort
yourself
with
the
idea
that
your
son
is
alive
at
any
but
how
can
i
be
sure
even
of
that
average
jones
glanced
at
a
copy
of
the
advertisement
which
he
held
i
think
we
can
take
morley
word
so
even
so
fifty
thousand
dollars
ransom
said
the
minister
and
stopped
with
a
groan
nonsense
said
average
jones
heartily
that
advertisement
counts
for
nothing
professional
kidnappers
do
not
select
the
sons
of
impecunious
ministers
for
their
prey
nor
do
they
give
addresses
through
which
they
may
be
found
you
can
dismiss
the
advertisement
as
a
blind
the
second
blind
in
the
second
certainly
the
first
was
the
clothing
on
the
shore
it
was
put
there
to
create
the
impression
that
your
son
was
yes
we
all
supposed
that
he
must
by
what
possible
hypothesis
a
boy
should
be
supposed
to
take
off
coat
and
waistcoat
and
wade
into
a
winter
sea
is
beyond
my
poor
powers
of
conjecture
said
the
other
no
somebody
the
clothes
it
seems
to
me
said
the
reverend
prentice
doubtfully
who
would
have
any
motive
for
doing
such
a
thing
that
is
what
we
have
to
find
out
what
time
did
your
son
go
to
his
room
the
night
of
his
disappearance
earlier
than
usual
as
i
remember
a
little
before
nine
any
special
reason
for
his
going
up
earlier
he
wanted
to
experiment
with
a
new
fishing
outfit
just
given
him
for
his
i
see
will
you
take
me
to
his
room
they
mounted
to
the
boy
quarters
which
overlooked
the
roof
of
the
side
porch
from
a
window
facing
north
the
charred
ruins
of
a
barn
about
half
a
mile
away
were
plainly
visible
through
this
window
the
barn
which
the
meteor
destroyed
said
the
reverend
prentice
pointing
it
out
one
glance
was
all
that
average
jones
bestowed
upon
a
spot
which
for
a
few
days
had
been
of
national
interest
his
concern
was
inside
the
room
a
stand
against
the
wall
was
littered
with
bits
of
shining
mechanism
an
unjointed
lay
on
the
bed
near
at
hand
were
a
small
and
a
knife
with
a
broken
blade
were
things
in
this
condition
when
you
came
to
call
bailey
in
the
morning
and
found
him
gone
asked
average
jones
nothing
has
been
touched
said
the
clergyman
in
a
low
voice
average
jones
straightened
up
and
stretched
himself
languidly
his
voice
when
he
spoke
again
took
on
the
slow
drawl
of
boredom
one
might
have
thought
that
he
had
lost
all
interest
in
the
case
but
for
the
thoughtful
pucker
of
the
broad
forehead
which
belied
his
halting
accents
then
er
when
bailey
left
here
he
had
any
idea
of
er
running
i
do
follow
you
psychology
said
average
jones
elementary
psychology
here
your
son
new
reel
a
normal
boy
does
abandon
a
fad
when
he
runs
away
it
is
in
boy
nature
no
he
was
taking
this
reel
apart
to
study
it
when
some
unexpected
occurrence
checked
him
and
drew
him
the
i
made
some
inquiries
in
the
village
on
my
way
up
none
of
the
hundreds
of
people
who
turned
out
for
the
fire
remembers
seeing
bailey
that
is
the
meteor
fell
at
bailey
went
upstairs
before
nine
allow
half
an
hour
for
taking
apart
the
reel
i
do
believe
he
have
been
longer
at
it
so
it
probable
that
he
was
out
of
the
house
before
the
meteor
i
should
have
heard
him
go
out
of
the
front
that
is
perhaps
why
he
went
out
of
the
window
observed
average
jones
indicating
certain
marks
on
the
sill
swinging
his
feet
over
he
stepped
upon
the
roof
of
the
porch
and
peered
at
the
ground
below
and
down
the
lightning
rod
he
added
for
a
moment
he
stood
meditating
the
ground
is
now
frozen
hard
he
said
presently
bailey
footprints
where
he
landed
are
deeply
marked
therefore
the
soil
must
have
been
pretty
soft
at
the
very
agreed
the
clergyman
there
had
been
a
downpour
up
to
the
evening
of
bailey
disappearance
about
nine
the
wind
shift
to
the
northeast
and
everything
froze
hard
there
has
been
no
thaw
you
seem
very
clear
on
these
points
i
noted
them
specially
having
in
mind
to
write
a
paper
on
the
meteorite
for
the
ah
perhaps
you
could
tell
me
then
how
soon
after
the
meteor
fall
the
barn
yonder
was
discovered
to
be
afire
almost
instantly
it
was
in
full
blaze
within
very
short
time
how
short
five
minutes
or
so
not
so
much
certainly
not
more
than
h
peculiar
drawled
average
jones
particularly
in
view
of
the
in
what
respect
in
respect
to
a
barn
by
a
rain
bursting
into
flame
like
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
but
the
friction
and
heat
of
the
meteorite
must
have
been
extremely
and
extremely
momentary
except
as
to
the
lower
floor
and
the
fire
should
have
taken
some
time
to
spread
from
that
however
to
turn
to
other
matters
he
swung
himself
over
the
edge
of
the
roof
and
went
briskly
down
the
lightning
rod
across
the
frozen
ground
he
moved
with
his
eyes
on
the
soil
and
presently
called
up
to
his
host
at
any
rate
he
started
across
lots
in
the
direction
of
the
barn
will
you
come
down
and
let
me
in
back
in
the
study
average
jones
sat
meditating
a
few
moments
presently
he
asked
did
you
go
to
the
spot
where
your
son
clothes
were
found
yes
some
time
where
was
it
on
the
seashore
some
half
a
mile
to
the
east
of
the
tuxall
place
and
a
little
is
there
a
roadway
from
the
tuxall
place
to
the
spot
no
i
believe
not
but
one
could
go
across
the
fields
and
through
the
barn
to
the
old
deserted
ah
there
an
old
roadway
is
there
yes
it
skirts
the
shore
to
join
boston
pike
about
three
miles
and
how
far
from
this
roadway
were
your
son
clothes
found
just
a
few
h
any
tracks
in
the
roadway
yes
i
recall
seeing
some
buggy
tracks
and
being
surprised
because
no
one
ever
drives
that
then
it
is
conceivable
that
your
son
clothes
might
have
been
tossed
from
a
passing
vehicle
to
the
spot
where
they
were
conceivable
certainly
but
i
can
see
no
grounds
for
such
a
how
far
down
the
road
in
this
direction
did
tracks
run
not
beyond
the
opening
from
the
tuxall
field
if
that
is
what
you
it
is
exactly
do
you
know
this
tuxall
hardly
at
all
he
is
a
recent
comer
among
well
i
shall
probably
want
to
make
his
acquaintance
have
a
care
then
he
is
very
jealous
of
his
precious
meteor
and
guards
the
ruins
of
the
barn
where
it
lies
with
a
shot
indeed
he
promises
to
be
an
interesting
study
meantime
i
like
to
look
at
your
son
from
a
closet
prentice
brought
out
a
coat
and
waistcoat
of
the
pattern
which
is
sold
by
the
hundreds
of
thousands
the
whole
country
over
these
the
visitor
examined
carefully
the
coat
was
caked
with
mud
particularly
thick
on
one
shoulder
he
called
the
minister
attention
to
it
that
would
be
from
lying
wet
on
the
shore
said
the
reverend
prentice
not
at
all
this
is
mud
not
sand
and
it
ground
or
pressed
in
has
any
one
tampered
with
these
since
they
were
found
i
went
through
the
average
jones
frowned
find
anything
nothing
of
importance
a
handkerchief
some
odds
and
ends
of
string
oh
and
a
paper
with
some
gibberish
on
what
was
the
nature
of
this
gibberish
why
it
might
have
been
some
sort
of
boyish
secret
code
though
it
was
hardly
decipherable
enough
to
judge
from
i
remember
some
flamboyant
adjectives
referring
to
something
three
feet
high
i
threw
the
paper
into
the
turning
that
receptacle
out
on
the
table
average
jones
discovered
in
the
debris
a
sheet
of
cheap
ruled
paper
covered
with
penciled
words
in
print
characters
most
of
these
had
been
crossed
out
in
favor
of
other
words
or
sentences
which
in
turn
had
been
evidently
the
writer
had
been
toilfully
experimenting
toward
some
elegance
or
emphasis
of
expression
which
persistently
eluded
him
amidst
the
wreck
and
ruin
of
rhetoric
however
one
phrase
stood
out
clear
stupendous
scientific
below
this
was
a
huddle
and
smudge
of
words
from
which
adjectives
darted
out
like
dim
flame
amidst
smoke
gigantic
showed
in
its
entity
followed
by
an
unintelligible
erasure
at
the
end
this
line
was
the
legend
feet
verita
visitor
appeared
below
and
beyond
it
what
seemed
to
be
the
word
and
near
the
foot
of
the
sheet
the
student
of
all
this
chaos
could
make
faintly
but
unmistakably
marvelous
the
rest
of
the
word
being
cut
off
by
a
broad
black
smear
monster
the
remainder
was
wholly
undecipherable
average
jones
looked
up
from
this
curio
and
there
was
a
strange
expression
in
the
eyes
which
met
the
minister
you
er
threw
this
in
the
er
he
drawled
in
which
pocket
was
it
the
waistcoat
an
upper
one
i
believe
there
was
a
pencil
there
have
you
an
old
pair
of
shoes
of
bailey
asked
the
visitor
abruptly
why
i
suppose
so
in
the
attic
please
bring
them
to
the
reverend
prentice
left
the
room
no
sooner
had
the
door
closed
after
him
than
average
jones
jumped
out
of
his
chair
stripped
to
his
shirt
caught
up
the
waistcoat
tried
it
on
and
buttoned
it
across
his
chest
without
difficulty
then
thrust
his
arm
into
the
coat
which
went
with
it
and
wormed
his
way
effortfully
partly
into
that
he
laid
it
aside
only
when
he
had
determined
that
he
could
get
it
no
farther
on
he
was
clothed
and
in
his
right
garments
when
the
reverend
prentice
returned
with
a
pair
of
shoes
will
these
do
he
asked
average
jones
hardly
gave
them
the
courtesy
of
a
glance
yes
he
said
indifferently
and
set
them
aside
have
you
a
here
you
going
to
leave
cried
the
clergyman
in
sharp
disappointment
in
just
half
an
hour
replied
the
visitor
holding
his
finger
on
the
but
cried
prentice
that
is
the
train
back
to
new
and
you
not
going
to
see
tuxall
nor
to
examine
the
place
where
the
clothes
were
found
have
mr

you
giving
up
the
attempt
to
discover
what
became
of
my
boy

what
became

minister
put
out
a
hand
and
grasped
the
back
of
a
chair
for
support
his
lips
parted
no
sound
came
from
them

jones
carefully
folded
the
paper
of
gibberish

tucked
it
away
in
his
card

bailey
has
been
carried
away
by
two
people
in
a
buggy
they
were
strangers
to
the
town
he
was
injured
and
unconscious
they
still
have
him
incidentally
he
has
seriously
interfered
with
a
daring
and
highly
ingenious
enterprise
that
is
all
i
can
tell
you
at
the
clergyman
found
his
voice
in
heaven
jones
he
cried
tell
me
who
and
what
these
people
i
do
know
who
they
are
i
do
know
what
they
are
but
it
can
do
no
good
to
tell
you
the
one
until
i
can
find
out
the
other
be
sure
of
one
thing
bailey
is
in
no
further
danger
you
hear
from
me
as
soon
as
i
have
anything
definite
to
with
that
the
reverend
prentice
had
to
be
content
that
and
a
few
days
later
a
sheet
of
bearing
the

court
temple
y

had
the
reverend
prentice
been
a
reader
of
journals
devoted
to
the
art
and
practice
of
printing
he
might
have
observed
that
message
widely
scattered
to
the
trade
it
was
answered
by
a
number
of
printing
shops
but
as
the
answers
came
in
to
average
jones
he
put
them
aside
because
none
of
the
seekers
for
business
was
able
to
show
finally
there
came
a
letter
from
hoke
and
hollins
of
rose
street
they
would
like
jones
to
call
and
inspect
some
special
type
upon
which
they
were
then
at
work
jones
called
the
junior
member
received
him
quite
providential
jones
he
said
we
turning
out
some
type
of
just
the
size
you
want
only
part
of
the
alphabet
however
is
that
a
fine
piece
of
lettering
he
held
up
an
enormous
m
to
the
admiration
of
his
visitor
excellent
approved
average
jones
i
like
to
see
other
letters
a
for
hollins
produced
a
symmetrical
a
and
now
an
r
if
you
please
and
perhaps
a
hollis
looked
at
his
visitor
with
suspicion
you
appear
to
be
selecting
the
very
letters
which
i
have
he
remarked
those
which
er
would
make
up
the
er
legend
monster
drawled
average
jones
then
you
know
the
farleys
said
the
print
man
the
flying
farleys
said
average
jones
they
used
to
do
ascensions
with
firework
trimmings
did
they
no
i
do
exactly
know
them
but
i
like
that
another
matter
retorted
hollins
annoyed
at
having
betrayed
himself
this
type
is
decidedly
a
private
even
a
i
had
no
right
to
say
anything
about
it
or
the
customers
who
ordered
still
you
could
see
that
a
letter
left
here
for
them
reached
them
i
after
some
hesitation
the
other
agreed
average
jones
sat
down
to
the
composition
of
an
epistle
which
should
be
sufficiently
imperative
without
being
too
alarming
having
completed
this
delicate
task
to
his
satisfaction
he
handed
the
result
to
hollins
if
you
have
already
struck
off
a
line
you
might
do
so
he
suggested
i
asked
the
farleys
for
a
print
of
it
and
i
fancy
they
be
sending
for
leaving
the
shop
he
went
direct
to
a
telegraph
office
whence
he
dispatched
two
messages
to
harwick
one
was
to
the
reverend
peter
prentice
the
other
was
to
the
local
chief
of
police
on
the
following
afternoon
prentice
trembling
in
the
anteroom
of
the
with
the
briefest
word
of
greeting
average
jones
led
him
into
his
private
office
where
a
boy
with
his
head
swathed
in
bandages
sat
waiting
as
the
closed
the
door
after
him
he
heard
the
breathless
boyish
hello
father
merged
in
the
broken
cry
of
the
reverend
peter
prentice
five
minutes
he
gave
father
and
son
when
he
returned
to
the
room
carrying
a
loose
roll
of
reddish
paper
he
was
followed
by
a
strange
couple
the
woman
was
plumply
muscular
her
attractive
face
was
both
defiant
and
uneasy
behind
her
strode
a
wiry
man
of
forty
his
chief
claim
to
notice
lay
in
an
outrageously
fancy
waistcoat
which
was
with
his
sober
commonplace
suit
mr
and
farley
the
reverend
prentice
said
average
jones
in
introduction
the
strangers
in
the
wagon
asked
the
clergyman
quickly
the
same
admitted
the
woman
briefly
the
reverend
prentice
turned
upon
farley
why
did
you
want
to
steal
my
boy
away
he
demanded
did
want
to
had
to
replied
that
gentleman
succinctly
let
do
this
in
order
suggested
average
jones
the
principal
actor
story
first
speak
up
do
know
my
own
story
said
the
boy
with
a
grin
only
part
of
it
farley
been
awful
good
to
me
takin
care
of
me
an
all
that
but
she
would
tell
me
how
i
got
hurt
or
where
i
was
when
i
woke
naturally
well
we
must
piece
it
out
among
us
now
bailey
you
were
working
over
your
reel
the
night
the
meteor
fell
when
what
meteor
i
do
know
anything
about
a
of
course
you
do
said
average
jones
laughing
stupid
of
me
for
the
moment
i
had
forgotten
that
you
were
out
of
the
world
then
well
about
nine
of
the
night
you
got
the
reel
you
looked
out
of
your
window
and
saw
a
queer
light
over
at
the
tuxall
that
right
but
say
jones
how
do
you
know
about
the
light
what
else
but
a
light
could
you
have
seen
on
a
night
average
jones
with
a
smile
and
it
must
have
been
something
unusual
or
you
would
have
dropped
everything
to
go
to
that
what
corroborated
the
boy
a
kind
of
flame
shot
up
from
the
ground
then
it
spread
a
little
then
it
went
out
and
there
were
people
running
around
ah
some
one
must
have
got
careless
with
the
oil
observed
average
jones
that
fool
tuxall
broke
in
farley
with
an
oath
it
was
him
gummed
the
whole
mr
tuxall
i
regret
to
say
remarked
average
jones
has
left
for
parts
unknown
so
the
harwick
authorities
inform
me
probably
foreseeing
a
charge
of
arson
repeated
the
reverend
prentice
in
astonishment
of
course
only
oil
and
matches
could
have
made
a
barn
flare
up
after
a
rain
as
his
did
now
bailey
to
continue
you
ran
across
the
fields
to
the
tuxall
place
and
went
around
let
me
see
the
wind
had
shifted
to
the
northeast
yes
to
the
northeast
of
the
barn
and
quite
a
distance
away
there
you
saw
a
man
at
work
in
his
said
the
boy
in
measured
tones
where
were
you
hiding
jones
not
behind
the
tree
there
anyway
returned
the
with
a
chuckle
there
is
a
tree
there
i
suppose
yes
and
there
was
something
alive
tied
up
in
it
with
a
well
not
exactly
alive
returned
average
jones
though
the
mistake
is
a
natural
i
tell
you
i
know
persisted
bailey
while
and
farley
were
workin
over
some
kind
of
a
box
i
shinned
up
the
bold
young
adventurer
and
what
did
you
find
one
of
the
limbs
was
shakin
and
thrashin
i
crawled
out
on
it
i
guess
it
was
kind
o
crazy
me
but
i
was
goin
to
find
out
what
was
what
if
i
broke
my
neck
there
was
a
rope
tied
to
it
and
some
big
thing
up
above
pullin
and
jerkin
at
it
tryin
to
get
away
pretty
soon
and
farley
came
almost
under
me
he
says
tuxall
all
ready
and
she
says
thinks
we
ought
to
wait
half
an
hour
the
be
full
of
folks
then
then
he
says
i
hate
to
risk
it
but
maybe
it
better
just
then
the
rope
gave
a
twist
and
came
swingin
over
on
me
and
knocked
me
right
off
the
limb
i
gave
a
yell
and
then
i
landed
next
i
knew
i
was
in
bed
and
that
now
i
take
up
the
wondrous
tale
said
average
jones
the
farleys
naturally
discomfited
by
bailey
abrupt
and
informal
arrival
were
in
a
quandary
here
was
an
inert
boy
on
their
hands
he
might
be
dead
which
would
be
bad
or
he
might
be
alive
which
would
be
worse
if
they
left
how
so
asked
the
reverend
prentice
why
you
see
explained
average
jones
they
could
tell
how
much
he
might
have
seen
and
heard
before
he
made
his
hasty
descent
he
might
have
enough
information
to
spoil
their
whole
careful
and
elaborate
but
what
in
the
world
was
their
plan
demanded
the
minister
that
comes
later
they
took
off
bailey
coat
and
waistcoat
perhaps
to
see
if
his
back
was
broken
farley
nodded
and
finding
him
alive
tossed
his
clothes
into
the
buggy
where
farley
had
left
his
own
and
completed
their
necessary
work
of
course
there
was
danger
that
bailey
might
come
to
at
any
moment
and
ruin
everything
so
they
worked
at
top
speed
and
left
the
final
performance
to
tuxall
in
their
excitement
they
forgot
to
find
out
from
their
accomplice
who
bailey
was
consequently
they
found
themselves
presently
driving
across
country
with
an
unknown
and
undesired
white
elephant
of
a
boy
on
their
hands
one
of
them
conceived
the
idea
of
tossing
his
clothes
upon
the
to
establish
a
false
clue
of
drowning
until
they
could
decide
what
was
to
be
done
with
him
in
carrying
this
out
they
made
the
mistake
which
lighted
up
the
whole
well
i
do
see
it
at
all
said
farley
glumly
how
did
you
ever
get
to
us
average
jones
mildly
contemplated
the
mathematical
center
of
his
questioner
new
waistcoat
he
asked
farley
glanced
down
at
the
outrageous
pattern
with
pride
yep
got
it
last
lost
the
one
that
came
with
the
suit
you
wearing
damn
exploded
farley
in
sudden
enlightenment
just
so
your
waistcoat
got
mixed
with
the
boy
clothes
which
are
of
the
same
common
pattern
and
was
tossed
out
on
the
beach
with
his
well
i
did
leave
a
card
in
it
did
i
retorted
the
other
something
just
as
the
ad
tim
cried
the
woman
do
you
remember
you
could
find
the
rough
draft
you
made
while
we
were
waiting
that
right
too
he
said
it
was
in
that
but
it
have
no
name
on
then
that
put
in
the
reverend
peter
prentice
was
the
scrawled
nonsense
which
you
er
threw
into
the
drawled
average
jones
with
a
smile
those
were
not
bailey
clothes
at
all
the
coat
was
his
not
the
waistcoat
his
waistcoat
may
have
fallen
out
of
the
buggy
or
it
may
be
there
but
what
does
all
this
talk
of
people
at
work
in
the
dark
and
arson
and
a
mysterious
creature
tied
in
a
tree
lead
to
it
leads
said
average
jones
to
a
very
large
rock
much
scorched
and
with
a
peculiar
carving
on
it
which
now
lies
imbedded
in
the
earth
beneath
tuxall
if
you
seen
that
said
farley
it
all
i
have
seen
it
i
inferred
it
but
it
all
up
serves
us
right
said
the
woman
disgustedly
i
wish
we
never
heard
of
tuxall
and
his
line
of
mystification
upon
mystification
cried
the
clergyman
will
some
one
please
give
a
clue
to
the
maze
in
a
word
said
average
jones
the
harwick
what
connection
pardon
me
one
moment
the
thing
in
the
tree
was
a
captive
balloon
the
box
on
the
ground
was
a
battery
the
wire
from
the
battery
was
connected
with
a
firework
bomb
which
when
tuxall
pressed
the
switch
exploded
releasing
a
flaming
about
the
time
the
reached
the
earth
tuxall
lighted
up
his
barn
all
harwick
having
had
its
attention
attracted
by
the
explosion
and
seen
the
portent
with
its
own
eyes
believed
that
a
huge
meteor
had
fired
the
building
so
tuxall
and
company
had
a
well
attested
wonder
from
the
heavens
that
the
little
plan
which
bailey
presence
threatened
to
wreck
is
it
your
opinion
that
the
stars
are
inhabited
prentice
what
cried
the
minister
gaping
stars
inhabited
living
sentient
how
should
i
know
you
be
interested
to
know
though
would
you
why
certainly
any
one
exactly
the
point
any
one
would
and
almost
any
one
would
pay
money
to
see
with
his
own
eye
the
attested
evidence
of
human
or
approximately
human
life
in
other
spheres
it
was
a
big
stake
that
tuxall
farley
and
company
were
playing
for
do
you
begin
to
see
the
meaning
of
the
big
print
now
i
heard
nothing
about
big
prints
said
the
puzzled
clergyman
pardon
me
you
heard
but
you
have
understood
however
to
go
on
tuxall
and
our
friends
here
fixed
up
a
plan
on
the
prospects
of
a
rich
harvest
from
public
curiosity
and
credulity
tuxall
planted
a
big
rock
under
the
barn
fixed
it
up
appropriately
with
torch
and
chisel
and
sent
for
the
farleys
who
are
expert
firework
and
balloon
people
to
counterfeit
a
amazing
cried
the
clergyman
such
a
meteor
furthermore
as
had
never
been
dreamed
of
before
if
you
were
to
visit
tuxall
barn
you
would
undoubtedly
find
on
the
boulder
underneath
it
a
carving
resembling
a
human
form
a
hoax
more
ambitious
than
the
cardiff
giant
he
carted
the
rock
in
from
some
quarry
and
did
the
scorching
and
carving
himself
i
and
you
discovered
all
that
in
a
visit
to
harwick
asked
the
reverend
prentice
incredulously
no
but
in
reading
of
the
which
you
threw
taking
from
the
desk
the
reddish
roll
which
he
had
brought
into
the
room
with
him
he
sent
the
loose
end
of
it
wheeling
across
the
floor
until
it
lay
fully
outspread
in
black
letters
against
red
the
legend
glared
and
blared
its
announcement
marvelous
monster
those
letters
prentice
pursued
the
measure
just
three
feet
from
top
to
bottom
the
phrase
feet
high
which
so
puzzled
you
as
combined
with
the
adjectives
of
great
size
was
obviously
a
printer
direction
all
through
the
smudged
which
you
threw
away
there
run
alliterative
lines
scientific
sensation
visitor
void
and
finally
monster
only
one
trade
is
irretrievably
committed
to
and
indubitably
by
alliteration
the
circus
trade
you
recall
that
farley
insensibly
fell
into
the
habit
even
in
his
advertisement
lad
for
ransom
and
morley
therefore
i
had
the
combination
circus
poster
an
alleged
meteor
which
burned
a
barn
in
a
highly
suspicious
manner
and
an
apparently
purposeless
kidnapping
the
inference
was
as
simple
as
it
was
certain
the
two
strangers
with
tuxall
aid
had
prepared
the
fake
meteor
with
a
view
to
exploiting
the
bailey
had
literally
tumbled
into
the
plot
they
did
know
how
much
he
had
seen
the
whole
affair
hinged
on
his
being
kept
quiet
so
they
took
him
along
all
that
i
had
to
do
then
was
to
find
the
deviser
of
the
poster
he
was
sure
to
be
bailey
say
said
farley
with
conviction
i
believe
you
the
devil
first
when
you
left
me
in
harwick
said
the
reverend
peter
prentice
before
average
jones
could
acknowledge
this
flattering
surmise
you
said
that
strangers
had
done
the
kidnapping
how
did
you
tell
they
were
strangers
then
from
the
fact
that
they
did
know
who
bailey
was
and
had
to
advertise
him
indefinitely
as
lad
from
harwick
and
that
there
were
two
of
them
pursued
the
minister
i
surmised
two
minds
one
that
schemed
out
the
of
the
clothes
on
the
shore
the
other
more
compassionate
that
promulgated
the
finally
then
how
could
you
know
that
bailey
was
injured
and
unconscious
if
he
had
been
unconscious
then
and
for
long
after
he
have
revealed
his
identity
to
his
captors
would
he
explained
the
there
was
a
long
pause
then
the
woman
said
timidly
well
and
now
what
nothing
answered
average
jones
tuxall
has
got
away
prentice
has
recovered
his
son
you
and
farley
have
had
your
lesson
and
i
yes
and
you
said
the
woman
as
he
paused
what
do
you
get
out
of
it
average
jones
cast
an
affectionate
glance
at
the
sprawling
legend
which
disfigured
his
floor
a
unique
curio
in
my
own
special
line
he
replied
an
ad
which
never
has
been
published
and
never
will
be
that
enough
for
there
was
a
double
knock
at
the
door
and
algernon
spofford
burst
in
wearing
a
face
of
gloom
say
average
he
began
but
broke
off
with
a
snort
of
amazement
you
found
him
cried
hello
prentice
well
bailey
alive
and
kicking
eh
yes
i
found
him
and
them
replied
average
jones
you
done
better
than
me
then
i
been
through
the
department
from
the
information
window
here
to
the
in
washington
and
nobody
help
me
find
mortimer
then
let
me
introduce
him
algy
this
is
mortimer
morley
in
less
private
life
tim
farley
and
his
wife
farley
well
i
be
exploded
spofford
how
did
you
work
it
out
average
on
the
previously
enunciated
principle
returned
average
jones
with
a
smile
that
when
rats
leave
a
sinking
ship
or
a
burning
building
there
usually
something
behind
worth

who
spoke

of

his
chosen
field

see
the

dated
sheet
of
paper
framed
in
with
the

of
a
chemist
and
an
advertised
sale
of

which
drove

of

near
by
are
displayed
the
exploitation
of
a
lure
for
strangely
perforated
a
man
reason
hung
on
those
and
a
scrawled
legend
which
seems
to
spell
mercy
two
men
lives
were
sacrificed
to
that
while
below
them
set
in
somber
black
is
the
funeral
notice
of
a
dog
worth

facing
the
call
for

made

and
the

formula
which
saved

nowhere
does
the
observer
find
any

of
one
of
the
most
curious
cases
running
back
two
thousand
years
for
its
owner
keeps
it
in
his
desk
drawer
whence
the
present
chronicler
exhumed
it
by
accident
one
day
average
jones
has
always
insisted
that
he
scored
a
failure
on
this
because
through
no
possible
fault
of
his
own
he
was
unable
to
restore
a
document
of
the
highest
historical
and
literary
importance
of
that
let
the
impartial
reader
judge
it
was
while
average
jones
was
waiting
for
a
break
of
that
deadlock
of
events
which
starting
from
the
with
the
poisoned
face
finally
worked
out
the
strange
fate
of
telfik
bey
that
he
sat
one
morning
breakfasting
late
the
cool
and
breezy
inner
portico
of
the
cosmic
club
where
small
tables
overlook
a
gracious
fountain
shimmering
with
the
dart
and
poise
of
goldfish
was
deserted
save
for
himself
a
star
actor
a
specialist
in
and
a
famous
adjuster
of
labor
troubles
the
four
men
being
fairly
typical
of
the
club
catholicity
of
membership
contrary
to
his
impeccant
habit
average
jones
bore
the
somewhat
frazzled
aspect
of
a
man
who
has
been
up
all
night
further
indication
of
this
inhered
in
the
wide
yawn
of
which
he
was
in
when
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
cut
short
his
ecstasy
sorry
to
interrupt
so
valuable
an
exercise
said
a
languid
voice
but
and
the
voice
stopped
hello
bert
returned
the
looking
up
at
the
faultlessly
clad
slenderness
of
his
occasional
coadjutor
robert
bertram
sit
down
and
keep
me
awake
till
the
human
snail
who
hypothetically
ministering
to
my
wants
can
get
me
some
what
particular
phase
of
intellectual
debauchery
have
you
been
up
to
now
inquired
bertram
lounging
into
the
chair
opposite
trying
to
forget
my
troubles
by
chasing
up
a
promising
lead
which
failed
to
pan
out
a
tin
nose
sounds
pretty
good
eh
it
is
music
to
my
untutored
ear
answered
bertram
but
it
turned
out
to
be
merely
an
error
of
the
imbecile
or
perhaps
facetious
printer
who
sets
up
the
trumpeter
personal
column
it
should
have
read
a
tea
even
that
seems
far
from
only
a
code
summons
for
a
meeting
of
the
rosicrucians
i
suppose
you
know
that
the
order
has
been
revived
here
in
not
the
true
rosicrucians
surely
said
bertram
they
pretend
to
be
a
stupid
lot
who
make
child
play
of
it
said
average
jones
impatiently
never
mind
them
i
rather
know
on
your
mind
you
made
an
observation
when
you
came
in
rather
more
interesting
than
your
usual
output
of
you
said
and
nothing
further
the
conjunction
in
polite
grammar
ordinarily
has
a
tail
to
apropos
of
polite
grammar
do
you
speak
latin
asked
bertram
carelessly
not
enough
to
be
gossipy
in
then
you
would
care
to
give
a
job
to
a
man
who
ca
speak
anything
else
on
that
qualification
alone
not
entirely
he
is
a
good
military
engineer
i
so
that
the
other
end
of
the
is
it
said
average
jones
go
on
bertram
laid
before
his
friend
a
printed
clipping
in
clear
large
type
saying
when
i
read
this
i
could
resist
the
notion
that
somehow
or
other
it
was
in
your
line
pursuit
of
the
adventure
of
life
and
all
that
let
see
what
you
make
of
average
jones
straightened
in
his
chair
latin
he
said
and
an
ad
by
the
look
of
it
can
our
blind
friend
alden
honeywell
have
taken
to
the

i
think
this
is
from
the
classical

a
baltimore
publication
of
small
and
select
hm
looks
alluring
commented
average
jones
with
a
prolonged
drawl
better
than
the

he
bent

you

asked
bertram
well
the

livius

to
yearn
in
modern

for
any
honest
employment
but
especially
scrapping
of
the
ancient
variety
or
secretarying
apply
to
agrippa
for
references
since
he
describes
his
conversation
as
being
confined
to

i
take
it
he
wo
find
many
jobs
reaching

for
him
anybody

him
can

now
what

suggested
bertram
association
with
agrippa
would
put
him
back
in
the
first

would
it
besides
my
informant
tells
me
that
livius
who
seems
to
have
been
an
sort
of
person
helped
organize
fire
brigades
for
crassus
and
was
one
of
the

you

do
you
retorted
jones
if
the
apology
is
i
suppose
not
owned
the

with
a
sigh
i
often
thought
that
my

would
gain
more

with

is
this
colonel
graeme
a
friend
of
yours
friend
and
foe
tried
and
true
we
meet
twice
a
week
usually
at
his
house
to
squabble
over
his
method
of
latin
pronunciation
and
his
construction
of
the
ablative
case
he
got
a
theory
of
the
ablative
absolute
said
warren
with
a
scowl
fit
to
fetch
tacitus
howling
from
the
a
scholar
then
a
very
fine
and
finished
scholar
though
a
faddist
of
the
rankest
type
speaks

as
readily
as
he
does
old
over
rich
not
in
money
taxes
on
his
big
place
keep
him
pinched
that
and
his
passion
for
buying
all
kinds
of
old
and
rare
books
he
got
perhaps
an
income
of
five
thousand
clear
of
which
about
three
thousand

any

no
lives
with
two
ancient
colored
servants
who
look
after
how
did
our
friend
from
connect
up
with
him
oh
he
ran
to
the
old
colonel
like
a
chick
to
its
hen
you
see
there
are
so
very
many
latinists
in
town
during
the
hot
weather
perhaps
eighteen
or
twenty
in
all
came
from
about
here
and
from
washington
to
see
the
prodigy
in
park
of
the
boar
after
the
advertisement
appeared
he
would
have
anything
to
do
with
any
of
us
pretended
he
did
understand
our
kind
of
latin
i
offered
him
a
place
myself
at
a
wage
of
more
denarii
than
i
could
well
afford
i
wanted
a
chance
to
study
him
then
came
the
colonel
and
fairy
grabbed
him
so
i
sent
for
you
in
my
artless
professional
why
such
enthusiasm
on
the
part
of
colonel
graeme
simple
enough
livius
spoke
latin
with
in
accent
which
bore
out
the
old
boy
contention
i
believe
they
also
agreed
on
the
ablative
yes
er
naturally
drawled
average
jones
does
our
early
roman
speak
pretty
ready
latin
he
fairly
fluent
sometimes
he
stumbles
a
little
on
his
constructions
and
he
apt
to
be
well
monkish
rather
than
classical
when
in
full
does
wear
the
toga
virilis
i
oh
no
plain
american
clothes
it
only
his
inner
man
that
roman
of
course
he
met
with
bump
on
the
head
this
is
his
story
and
got
a
the
scar
to
show
for
it
and
when
he
came
to
he
lost
ground
a
couple
of
thousand
years
and
returned
to
his
former
existence
no
english
no
memory
of
who
or
what
he
been
no
money
connection
whatsoever
with
the
living
humph
wonder
if
he
been
a
student
of
kippling
you
remember
greatest
story
in
the
world
the
reincarnated
galley
slave
now
as
to
this
colonel
graeme
has
he
ever
published
yes
two
small
pamphlets
issued
by
the
classicist
press
which
publishes
the
classical
supporting
his
fads
i
right
he
devoted
one
pamphlet
to
average
jones
contemplated
with
absorbed
attention
an
ant
which
was
making
a
laborious
spiral
ascent
of
his
cane
not
until
it
had
gained
a
vantage
point
on
the
bone
handle
did
he
speak
again
see
here
professor
warren
i
a
passionate
devotee
of
the
latin
tongue
i
have
my
deep
and
dark
suspicions
of
our
present
modes
of
pronunciation
all
three
of
as
for
the
ablative
absolute
its
reconstruction
and
regeneration
have
been
the
inspiring
principle
of
my
studious
manhood
humbly
i
have
sat
at
the
feet
of
learning
enshrined
in
the
ridgway
graeme
pamphlets
i
must
meet
colonel
graeme
after
reading
the
pamphlets
i
hope
they
not
warren
frowned
colonel
graeme
is
a
gentleman
and
my
friend
jones
he
said
with
emphasis
i
wo
have
him
made
a
he
sha
be
by
me
said
average
jones
quietly
has
it
perhaps
struck
you
as
his
friend
that
er
a
close
daily
association
with
the
psychic
remnant
of
a
roman
citizen
might
conceivably
be
to
his
best
interest
yes
it
has
i
see
your
point
you
want
to
approach
him
on
his
weak
side
but
have
you
latin
enough
to
sustain
the
part
he
shrewd
as
a
weasel
in
all
matters
of
scholarship
though
a
child
whom
any
one
could
fool
in
practical
no
i
have
admitted
average
jones
therefore
i
a
mute
a
shock
in
early
childhood
paralyzed
my
centers
of
speech
i
talk
to
you
by
sign
language
and
you
but
i
hardly
know
the
nor
i
but
i
waggle
my
fingers
like
lightning
if
he
says
anything
to
me
requiring
an
answer
and
you
give
the
proper
reply
does
colonel
graeme
implicitly
credit
the
romanism
of
his
guest
he
does
because
he
wants
to
to
have
an
educated
man
of
the
classic
period
of
the
latin
tongue
a
friend
of
caesar
an
auditor
of
cicero
and
a
contemporary
of
virgil
horace
and
ovid
come
back
and
speak
in
the
accent
he
contended
for
make
a
powerful
support
for
his
theories
he
at
work
on
a
supplementary
thesis
what
do
the
other
latin
men
who
seen
livius
think
of
the
metempsychosis
claim
they
do
know
livius
explained
his
remote
antecedents
only
after
he
had
got
colonel
graeme
private
ear
the
colonel
has
kept
it
quiet
want
a
rabble
of
psychologists
and
worrying
him
to
death
he
making
it
pretty
plain
sailing
for
the
roman
well
arrange
to
take
me
there
as
soon
as
at
the
graeme
house
average
jones
was
received
with
simple
courtesy
by
a
thin
old
gentleman
with
a
imperial
and
a
dreamy
eye
who
on
warren
introduction
made
him
free
of
the
unkempt
old
place
hospitality
they
conversed
for
a
time
average
jones
maintaining
his
end
with
nods
and
gestures
and
ostensibly
through
the
digital
mediumship
of
his
sponsor
presently
warren
said
to
the
host
and
where
is
your
visitor
from
the
past
prowling
among
my
books
answered
the
old
gentleman
are
we
not
going
to
see
him
the
colonel
looked
a
little
embarrassed
the
fact
is
professor
warren
livius
has
taken
rather
an
aversion
to
i
sorry
how
so
a
twinkle
of
malice
shone
in
the
old
scholar
eye
he
says
your
latin
accent
frets
his
nerves
he
explained
in
that
case
said
warren
obeying
a
quick
signal
from
his
accomplice
i
stroll
in
the
garden
while
you
present
jones
to
colonel
graeme
led
the
way
to
a
lofty
wing
once
used
as
a
but
now
the
repository
for
thousands
of
books
which
not
only
filled
the
shelves
but
were
heaped
up
in
every
corner
i
must
apologize
for
this
confusion
sir
said
the
host
no
one
is
permitted
to
arrange
my
books
but
myself
and
my
efforts
i
fear
serve
only
to
make
confusion
more
confounded
there
are
four
other
rooms
even
more
chaotic
than
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
a
man
who
had
been
seated
behind
a
tumulus
of
volumes
rose
and
stood
average
jones
looked
at
him
keenly
he
was
perhaps
years
of
age
thin
and
sinewy
with
a
face
pale
blue
eyes
and
a
narrow
forehead
running
high
into
a
mop
of
grizzled
locks
diagonally
across
the
front
part
of
the
scalp
a
scar
could
be
dimly
perceived
through
the
hair
average
jones
glanced
at
the
stranger
hands
to
gain
if
possible
some
hint
of
his
former
employment
with
his
faculty
of
swift
observation
he
noticed
that
the
long
slender
fingers
were
not
only
mottled
with
dust
but
also
scuffed
and
in
places
scarified
as
if
their
owner
had
been
hurriedly
handling
a
great
number
of
books
colonel
graeme
presented
the
in
formal
latin
he
bowed
the
scarred
man
made
a
curious
gesture
of
the
hand
addressing
average
jones
in
an
accent
which
even
to
the
young
man
cars
sounded
strange
and
strained
di
illi
linguam
astrinxere
mutus
est
said
colonel
graeme
indicating
the
younger
man
and
added
a
sentence
in
sonorous
metrical
greek
average
jones
recalled
the
aeschylean
line
well
though
great
ox
hath
stepped
on
my
tongue
it
has
trodden
out
my
eyes
praises
be
said
he
to
himself
as
he
caught
the
uneasy
glance
of
the
roman
by
way
of
allaying
suspicion
he
scribbled
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
a
few
complimentary
latin
sentences
in
which
warren
had
sedulously
coached
him
for
the
occasion
and
withdrew
to
the
front
room
where
he
was
presently
joined
by
the
johns
hopkins
man
fortunately
the
colonel
gave
them
a
few
moments
together
arrange
for
me
to
come
here
daily
to
study
in
the
library
whispered
jones
to
the
latin
professor
the
other
nodded
now
sit
tight
added
jones
he
stepped
on
the
thick
old
rug
across
to
the
library
door
and
threw
it
open
just
inside
stood
livius
an
expression
of
startled
anger
on
his
thin
face
quickly
recovering
himself
he
explained
in
his
ready
latin
that
he
was
about
to
enter
and
speak
to
his
patron
shows
a
remarkable
interest
in
possible
conversation
whispered
jones
on
his
withdrawal
for
a
man
who
understands
no
english
also
does
me
the
honor
to
suspect
me
he
must
have
been
a
wily
chap
in
the
consulship
of
before
leaving
average
jones
had
received
from
colonel
graeme
a
general
invitation
to
spend
as
much
time
as
he
chose
studying
among
the
books
the
old
saul
had
orders
to
admit
him
at
any
hour
he
returned
to
his
hotel
to
write
a
courteous
note
of
acknowledgment
many
hours
has
average
jones
spent
more
tediously
than
those
passed
in
the
cool
seclusion
of
colonel
ridgway
graeme
of
print
he
burrowed
among
quaint
accumulations
of
forgotten
classics
he
dipped
with
astonishment
into
the
savage
and
satire
of
von
hutter
epistola
obscurorum
virorumf
which
set
early
sixteenth
century
europe
with
laughter
at
the
discomfited
monks
and
he
cleansed
himself
from
that
tainted
atmosphere
in
the
fresh
air
and
free
english
of
a
splendid
audubon
first
and
all
the
time
he
was
conscious
that
the
roman
watched
watched
watched
more
than
once
livius
offered
aid
seeking
to
apprise
himself
of
the
supposed
mute
line
of
investigation
but
the
other
smilingly
fended
him
off
at
the
end
of
four
days
average
jones
had
satisfied
himself
that
if
livius
were
seeking
anything
in
particular
he
had
an
indefinite
task
before
him
for
the
colonel
bound
treasures
were
in
indescribable
confusion
apparently
he
had
bought
from
far
and
near
without
definite
theme
or
purpose
as
he
bought
he
read
and
having
read
cast
aside
and
where
a
volume
fell
there
it
had
license
to
lie
no
cataloguer
had
ever
sought
to
restore
order
to
that
bibliographic
riot
to
seek
any
given
book
meant
a
blind
voyage
without
compass
or
chart
throughout
the
mingled
centuries
often
colonel
graeme
spent
hours
in
one
or
the
other
of
the
huge
talking
with
his
strange
protege
and
making
copious
notes
usually
the
old
gentleman
questioned
and
the
other
answered
but
one
morning
the
attitude
seemed
to
the
listening
to
be
reversed
livius
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
was
speaking
in
a
low
tone
to
judge
from
the
older
man
impatient
manner
the
roman
was
interrupting
his
host
current
of
queries
with
interrogations
of
his
own
average
jones
made
a
mental
note
and
in
conference
with
warren
that
evening
asked
him
to
ascertain
from
colonel
graeme
whether
livius
inquiries
had
indicated
a
specific
interest
in
any
particular
line
of
reading
on
the
following
day
however
an
event
of
more
immediate
import
occupied
his
mind
he
had
spent
the
morning
in
the
library
at
the
unevadable
suggestion
of
colonel
graeme
while
the
colonel
and
his
roman
collogued
below
coming
down
about
noon
average
jones
entered
the
colonel
small
study
just
in
time
to
see
livius
who
was
alone
in
the
room
turn
away
sharply
from
the
desk
his
elbow
was
held
close
to
his
ribs
in
a
peculiar
manner
he
was
concealing
something
under
his
coat
with
a
pretense
of
clumsiness
average
jones
stumbled
against
him
in
passing
livius
drew
away
his
high
forehead
working
with
suspicion
the
expression
of
blank
apology
eked
out
with
a
bow
and
a
grimace
belied
the
mind
within
for
in
the
contact
he
had
heard
the
crisp
rustle
of
paper
from
beneath
the
coat
what
paper
had
the
man
from
taken
furtively
from
his
table
it
must
be
large
otherwise
he
could
have
readily
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
no
sooner
was
livius
out
of
the
room
than
average
jones
scanned
the
desk
his
face
lighted
with
a
sudden
smile
colonel
graeme
never
read
a
newspaper
boasted
in
fact
that
he
would
have
one
about
the
place
but
as
average
jones
distinctly
recalled
he
had
himself
that
very
morning
brought
in
a
copy
of
the
globe
and
dropped
it
into
the
scrap
basket
near
the
it
was
gone
livius
had
taken
it
if
he
got
the
habit
said
average
jones
to
himself
i
set
a
trap
for
him
but
warren
must
furnish
the
he
went
to
look
up
his
aide
the
conference
between
them
was
long
and
exhaustive
covering
the
main
points
of
the
case
from
the
beginning
did
you
find
out
from
colonel
graeme
inquired
average
jones
whether
livius
affected
any
particular
brand
of
literature
yes
he
seems
to
be
specializing
on
late
seventeenth
century
british
classicism
apparently
he
considers
that
the
flower
of
british
scholarship
of
that
time
wrote
a
very
inferior
kind
of
dog
late
seventeenth
century
latinity
commented
average
jones
that
er
gives
us
a
fair
start
now
as
to
the
old
saul
i
questioned
him
about
strange
callers
he
said
he
remembered
only
two
besides
an
occasional
peddler
or
agent
they
were
looking
for
what
kind
of
work
inside
the
house
one
wanted
to
catalogue
the
what
did
he
look
like
saul
says
he
wore
glasses
and
a
worse
tall
hat
than
the
colonel
and
had
a
full
and
the
other
bookbinder
and
repairer
wanted
to
fix
up
colonel
graeme
collection
youngish
smartly
dressed
with
a
small
waxed
and
our
livius
is
murmured
average
jones
how
long
apart
did
they
call
about
two
weeks
the
second
applicant
came
on
the
day
of
the
last
snowfall
i
looked
that
up
it
was
march
do
you
know
warren
observed
average
jones
i
sometimes
think
that
part
of
your
talents
at
least
are
wasted
in
a
chair
of
certainly
there
is
more
excitement
in
this
game
as
you
play
it
than
in
the
pursuits
of
a
musty
pedant
admitted
the
other
crackling
his
large
knuckles
but
when
are
we
going
to
spring
upon
friend
livius
and
strip
him
of
his
fake
toga
that
the
easiest
part
of
it
i
already
caught
him
filling
a
as
if
he
been
brought
up
on
them
and
humming
the
spinning
chorus
from
the
flying
dutchman
not
to
mention
the
lifting
of
my
nemo
mortalium
omnibus
horis
sapit
murmured
warren
no
as
you
say
no
fellow
can
be
on
the
job
all
the
time
but
our
problem
is
not
to
catch
livius
but
to
find
out
what
it
is
he
been
after
for
the
last
three
three
months
you
assuming
that
it
was
he
who
applied
for
work
in
the
certainly
and
when
he
failed
at
that
he
set
about
a
very
carefully
developed
scheme
to
get
at
colonel
graeme
books
anyway
by
inquiries
he
found
out
the
old
gentleman
fad
and
proceeded
to
get
in
training
for
it
you
do
know
perhaps
that
i
have
a
corps
of
assistants
who
clip
catalogue
and
file
all
unusual
advertisements
here
is
one
which
they
turned
up
for
me
on
my
order
to
send
me
any
queer
educational
advertisements
daily
lessons
in
latin
speech
from
competent
spanish
scholar
write
box
banner
office
that
is
from
the
new
york
banner
of
april
third
shortly
after
the
strange
caller
second
abortive
attempt
to
get
into
the
graeme
i
suppose
our
livius
figured
out
that
colonel
graeme
theory
of
accent
was
about
what
a
spaniard
would
have
but
he
could
have
learned
all
his
latin
in
four
he
did
he
was
a
scholar
already
an
accomplished
one
who
went
wrong
through
drink
and
became
a
crook
specializing
in
rare
books
and
prints
his
name
is
enderby
you
find
it
in
the
harvard
catalogue
he
supposed
to
be
dead
my
assistant
traced
him
through
his
teacher
a
but
even
allowing
for
his
scholarship
he
must
have
put
in
a
deal
of
work
perfecting
himself
in
readiness
of
speech
and
so
he
did
therefore
the
prize
must
be
big
a
man
of
enderby
caliber
does
concoct
a
scheme
of
such
ingenuity
and
go
into
bondage
with
it
for
nothing
do
you
belong
to
the
cosmic
club
the
assistant
professor
stared
no
he
said
i
like
to
put
you
up
there
one
advantage
of
membership
is
that
its
roster
includes
experts
in
every
known
line
of
erudition
from
scarabs
to
skeeing
for
example
i
am
now
going
to
telegraph
for
aid
from
old
millington
who
seldom
misses
a
book
auction
and
is
a
human
bibliography
of
the
wanderings
of
all
rare
volumes
i
going
to
find
out
from
him
what
british
publication
of
the
late
seventeenth
century
in
latin
is
very
valuable
also
what
volumes
of
that
time
have
changed
hands
in
the
last
six
colonel
graeme
went
to
a
big
book
auction
in
new
york
early
in
march
volunteered
warren
but
he
told
me
he
did
pick
up
anything
of
particular
then
it
something
he
does
know
about
and
livius
does
i
going
to
take
advantage
of
our
roman
rather
habit
of
reading
the
daily
papers
by
trying
him
out
with
this
average
jones
wrote
rapidly
and
tossed
the
result
to
his
coadjutor
who
read
lost
old
book
printed
in
latin
buff
leather
binding
a
little
faded
safe
to
be
that
explained
average
jones
no
great
value
except
to
owner
return
to
colonel
ridgway
graeme
carteret
street
and
receive
the
advertisement
made
its
appearance
in
big
type
on
the
front
pages
of
the
baltimore
paper
of
the
following
day
that
evening
average
jones
met
warren
for
dinner
with
a
puckered
brow
did
livius
rise
to
the
bait
asked
the
scholar
did
he
chuckled
average
jones
he
been
nervous
as
a
cat
all
day
and
hardly
has
looked
at
the
library
but
what
puzzles
me
is
he
exhibited
a
telegram
from
new
york
millington
says
positively
no
book
of
that
time
and
description
any
great
value
enderby
at
barclay
auction
in
march
and
made
row
over
some
book
which
he
missed
because
it
was
put
up
out
of
turn
in
catalogue
barclay
auctioneer
thinks
it
was
one
of
percival
privately
bound
books
am
anonymous
book
of
percival
library
de
meritis
librorum
britannorum
was
sold
to
colonel
graeme
for
a
good
price
when
do
i
get
in
on
this
signed
robert
i
know
that
treatise
said
warren
it
is
particularly
average
jones
stared
at
the
telegram
in
silence
finally
he
drawled
there
are
er
books
and
er
books
and
er
things
in
books
wait
here
for
three
hours
later
he
reappeared
with
collar
wilted
but
spirits
elate
and
abruptly
announced
warren
i
a
a
what
a
cobbler
mend
your
boots
you
are
you
in
earnest
certainly
have
you
ever
remarked
that
a
earnestness
always
goes
with
cobbling
though
i
not
really
a
practical
cobbler
but
a
proprietary
one
our
friend
bertram
will
dress
and
act
the
practical
part
i
wired
him
and
he
replied
collect
accepting
the
job
you
and
i
will
be
in
the
where
no
jasmine
street
not
a
very
savory
locality
why
is
it
warren
that
the
beauty
of
a
city
street
is
generally
in
inverse
ratio
to
the
poetic
quality
of
its
name
there
i
hired
the
shop
and
stock
of
hans
fichtel
for
two
days
at
the
handsome
rental
of
ten
dollars
per

fichtel
purposes
to
take
a
keg
of
beer
i
think
two
days
will
be
for
the
keg
for
that
noble
roman
livius
he
be
reading
the
papers
pretty
keenly
now
and
in
he
find
this
average
jones
read
from
a
sheet
of
paper
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
found
old
book
in
foreign
language
probably
latin
marked
owner
may
recover
by
giving
satisfactory
description
of
peculiar
and
obscure
feature
and
refunding
for

fichtel
jasmine
what
is
the
peculiar
and
obscure
feature
jones
asked
warren
i
do
how
do
you
know
there
is
any
must
be
something
peculiar
about
the
book
or
enderby
would
put
in
four
months
of
work
on
the
chance
of
stealing
it
and
it
must
be
obscure
otherwise
the
auctioneer
would
have
spotted
sound
enough
approved
the
other
what
could
it
be
some
interpolated
page
hardly
i
a
treatise
in
my
pocket
on
seventeenth
century
which
i
going
to
study
be
ready
for
an
early
start
to
meet
that
languid
and
elegant
gentleman
arrived
by
the
first
morning
train
he
protested
mightily
when
he
was
led
to
the
humble
he
protested
more
mightily
when
invited
to
don
a
leather
apron
and
smudge
his
face
appropriately
to
his
trade
his
protests
waxing
vehement
and
eventually
profane
as
he
barked
his
fingers
in
rehearsal
for
giving
a
correct
representation
of
an
honest
artisan
cobbling
a
boot
died
away
when
average
jones
explained
to
him
that
on
pretense
of
having
found
a
rare
book
he
was
to
worm
out
of
a
cautious
and
probably
suspicious
criminal
the
nature
of
some
unique
and
hidden
feature
of
the
volume
trust
me
for
diplomacy
said
bertram
airily
i
will
because
i
got
to
retorted
average
jones
well
get
to
work
to
you
the
outer
shop
to
warren
and
me
this
rear
room
and
remember
if
you
hear
me
whetting
a
knife
that
means
come
at
uncomfortably
twisted
into
a
supposedly
professional
posture
bertram
wrought
with
hammer
and
last
while
putting
off
with
lame
blind
and
halting
excuses
such
as
came
to
call
for
their
promised
footgear
by
a
triumph
of
tact
he
had
just
disposed
of
a
female
who
demanded
her
husband
boots
a
satisfactory
explanation
or
the
arbitrament
of
the
lists
when
the
bell
tinkled
and
the
two
watchers
in
the
back
room
heard
a
nervous
cultivated
voice
say
is
fichtel
here
that
me
said
bertram
landing
an
agonizing
blow
on
his
you
advertised
that
you
had
found
an
old
yes
sir
somebody
left
it
in
the
ah
that
must
have
been
when
i
went
to
mail
some
letters
to
new
york
said
the
other
glibly
from
the
advertised
description
the
book
is
without
doubt
mine
now
as
to
the
reward
excuse
me
but
you
would
expect
me
to
give
it
up
without
any
identification
sir
certainly
not
it
was
the
de
meritis
libror
i
ca
read
latin
but
you
could
make
that
much
out
said
the
visitor
with
rising
exasperation
come
if
it
a
matter
of
the
reward
how
much
i
would
mind
having
a
good
reward
say
ten
dollars
but
i
want
to
be
sure
it
your
book
there
something
about
it
that
you
could
easily
tell
me
sir
for
any
one
could
see
a
very
observing
shoemaker
commented
the
other
with
a
slight
sneer
you
mean
the
the
half
split
cover
sounded
from
the
rear
room
excuse
me
said
bertram
who
had
not
ceased
from
his
pretended
work
i
have
to
get
a
piece
of
he
stepped
into
the
back
room
where
average
jones
his
face
alight
held
up
a
piece
of
paper
upon
which
he
had
hurriedly
scrawled
mss
bound
into
cover
get
it
out
of
him
tell
him
you
a
brother
who
is
a
latin
bertram
nodded
caught
up
a
strip
of
and
returned
yes
sir
he
said
the
split
cover
and
what
inside
the
other
started
you
did
get
it
out
he
cried
you
did
tear
it
no
sir
it
there
safe
enough
but
some
of
it
can
be
made
you
said
you
did
read
no
sir
but
i
have
a
brother
that
went
through
the
academy
he
reads
a
this
was
thin
ice
but
bertram
went
forward
with
assumed
assurance
he
thinks
the
manuscript
is
quite
rare
oh
fritz
come
any
letter
of
bacon
is
rare
of
course
returned
the
other
impatiently
therefore
i
purpose
offering
you
fifty
dollars
he
looked
up
as
average
jones
entered
the
young
man
sleeves
were
rolled
up
his
face
was
generously
smudged
and
a
strip
of
cobbler
wax
beneath
the
tipper
lip
puffed
and
distorted
the
firm
line
of
his
mouth
further
his
head
was
louting
low
on
his
neck
so
that
the
visitor
got
no
view
sufficient
for
recognition
lord
bacon
letter
er
must
be
pretty
rare
mister
he
drawled
thickly
but
a
letter
er
from
lord
bacon
er
about
shakespeare
that
ought
to
be
worth
a
lot
of
average
jones
had
taken
his
opening
with
his
customary
incisive
shrewdness
the
mention
of
bacon
had
settled
it
to
his
mind
only
one
imaginable
character
of
manuscript
from
the
philosopher
could
have
value
enough
to
tempt
a
thief
of
calibre
enderby
expression
told
that
the
shot
was
a
true
one
as
for
bertram
he
had
dropped
his
shoemaker
knife
and
his
shoemaker
role
bacon
on
shakespeare
shades
of
the
departed
glory
of
ignatius
donnelly
the
visitor
drew
back
warren
gaunt
frame
appeared
in
the
doorway
jones
head
lifted
it
ought
to
be
as
er
unique
he
drawled
as
an
er
ancient
roman
speaking
perfect
like
a
flash
the
false
livius
caught
up
the
knife
from
the
bench
where
the
false
cobbler
had
dropped
it
and
swung
toward
average
jones
at
the
moment
the
ample
hand
of
professor
warren
bunched
into
a
highly
competent
fist
flicked
across
and
caught
the
assailant
under
the
ear
enderby
alias
livius
fell
as
if
smitten
by
a
cestus
as
his
arm
touched
the
floor
average
jones
kicked
unerringly
at
the
wrist
and
the
knife
flew
and
tinkled
in
a
far
corner
bertram
with
a
bound
landed
on
the
fallen
man
chest
and
pinned
him
he
get
you
average
he
cried
not
er
this
time
pretty
good

team
work
drawled
the
we
got
our
man
for
felonious
assault
at
enderby
panting
under
bertram
solid
knee
blinked
and
struggled
no
use
livius
said
average
jones
might
as
well
quiet
down
and
confess
ease
up
a
little
on
him
bert
take
a
look
at
that
scar
of
his
first
superficial
cut
treated
with
paint
a
clever
job
pronounced
bertram
after
a
quick
examination
as
i
supposed
said
average
jones
let
me
in
on
the
deal
pleaded
livius
that
letter
is
worth
ten
thousand
twelve
thousand
fifteen
thousand
dollars
anything
you
want
to
ask
if
you
find
the
right
purchaser
and
you
ca
manage
it
without
me
let
me
thinks
we
crooks
too
remarked
average
jones
exactly
what
in
this
wonderful
letter
it
from
bacon
to
the
author
of
the
book
who
wrote
about
bacon
prophesies
that
shakespeare
vagabond
and
humble
mummer
would
outshine
and
outlive
in
fame
all
the
genius
of
his
time
that
all
i
could
make
out
by
loosening
the
well
that
is
worth
anything
one
could
demand
said
warren
in
a
somewhat
awed
tone
why
did
you
get
the
letter
when
you
were
examining
it
at
the
auction
room
inquired
average
jones
some
fool
of
a
binder
had
overlooked
the
double
cover
and
sewed
it
in
i
noticed
it
at
the
auction
gummed
the
opening
together
while
no
one
was
watching
and
had
gone
to
get
cash
to
buy
the
book
but
the
auctioneer
put
it
up
out
of
turn
and
old
graeme
got
it
bring
it
to
me
and
i
show
you
the
cover
many
of
the
percival
books
were
bound
that
we
never
had
it
nor
seen
it
replied
average
jones
the
advertisement
was
only
a
trap
into
which
you
enderby
jaw
dropped
then
it
still
at
the
graeme
house
he
cried
beating
on
the
floor
with
his
free
hand
take
me
back
there
oh
we
take
you
said
warren
grimly
among
them
in
a
cab
they
drove
him
back
to
carteret
street
colonel
ridgway
graeme
was
at
home
and
greeted
them
courteously
you
found
livius
he
said
with
relief
i
had
begun
to
fear
for
colonel
graeme
began
average
jones
you
have
what
speech
cried
the
old
gentleman
and
you
a
mute
what
does
this
mean
never
mind
him
broke
in
enderby
livius
there
something
more
but
the
colonel
had
shrunk
back
english
from
you
livius
he
cried
setting
his
hand
to
his
brow
all
will
be
explained
in
time
colonel
warren
assured
him
meanwhile
you
have
a
document
of
the
utmost
importance
and
value
do
you
remember
buying
one
of
the
percival
volumes
at
the
barclay
auction
the
collector
drew
his
brows
down
in
an
effort
to
remember
an
octavo
in
fairly
good
condition
he
asked
yes
yes
cried
enderby
eagerly
where
is
it
what
did
you
do
with
it
it
was
in
latin
very
false
the
four
men
leaned
forward
breathless
oh
i
remember
it
slipped
from
my
pocket
and
fell
into
the
river
as
i
was
crossing
the
ferry
to
there
was
a
dead
flat
stricken
silence
then
average
jones
turned
hollow
eyes
upon
warren

he
said
with
a
rueful
attempt
at
a
smile
what
the
past
participle
passive
plural
of
the
latin
verb
sting
chapter
x
the
one
best
bet
morrison
has
jammed
the
personal
liberty
bill
through
said
waldemar
scrawling
a
head
on
his
completed
editorial
with
one
eye
on
the
clock
which
pointed
to
midnight
that
was
to
be
expected
was
it
asked
average
jones
oh
yes
replied
the
of
the
universal
in
his
heavy
bass
and
now
the
governor
announces
he
will
veto
thereby
bringing
the
whole
power
of
the
gambling
ring
down
on
him
like
an
naturally
morrison
has
declared
open
war
against
phil
as
he
calls

arthur
says
he
pass
the
bill
over
his
veto
in
his
heart
he
knows
he
ca
do
it
still
he
a
hard
average
jones
tipped
his
chair
back
against
the
wall
of
the
editorial
sanctum
what
do
you
suppose
he
inquired
with
an
air
of
philosophic
speculation
that
the
devil
will
do
with
carroll
morrison
soul
when
he
gets
it
deodorize
it
harsh
words
young
sir
harsh
words
and
treasonable
against
one
of

of

companies
and

and

retorted
average
jones
improve
the
breed
of
horses
if
you
please
to
make
thieves
of
men
and
harlots
of
women
because
carroll
morrison
must
have
his
dividends
and
now
he
has
our
legislature
working
for
him
to
that
honorable
end
man
to
see
you
waldemar
said
an
office
boy
appearing
at
the
door
too
late
grunted
the
editor
he
says
it
very
particular
sir
and
to
tell
you
it
something
morrison
is
interested
morrison
eh
all
right
just
step
into
the
inner
office
will
you
jones
leave
the
door
open
there
might
be
something
hardly
had
average
jones
found
a
chair
in
the
darkened
office
when
the
late
caller
appeared
he
was
pursy
and
dressed
with
ostentation
his
face
was
bloated
and
seared
with
excesses
but
it
was
not
intoxication
that
sweated
on
his
forehead
and
quivered
in
his
jaw
it
was
terror
he
slumped
into
the
waiting
chair
and
mouthed
mutely
at
the
editor
well
the
snap
of
the
interrogation
stung
the
man
into
babbling
speech
like

misser

gawsake
kill

the
visitor
stood
up
and
dug
both
hands
into
his
side
pockets
he
produced
first
a
binocular
which
with
a
snarl
he
flung
upon
the
floor
before
it
had
stopped
bumping
there
fluttered
down
upon
the
seat
of
his
chair
a
handful
of
greenbacks
another
followed
and
another
and
another
the
bills
toppled
and
spread
and
some
of
them
slid
to
the
floor

the
man
delved
there

panted

put

there
was
something
loathsome
and
obscene
in
the
creature
gibbering
flux
of
words
the
editor
leaned
forward
bribery

inquired
softly
the
man
flinched
from
the
tone

oh

if
he
finds
out
put
that
money
back
in
your
with
an
ashen
face
of
despair
the
man
obeyed
as
he
finished
he
began
to
sag
at
the
joints
slowly
he
slackened
down
until
he
was
on
his
knees
an
abject
spectacle
of
disgust
stand
up
ordered
waldemar
t
me
moaned
the
man
i
make
it
three
thousand
fi
thou
stand
up
the
editor
hearty
grip
on
his
coat
collar
heaved
the
creature
to
his
feet
for
a
moment
he
struggled
panting
then
spun
helpless
and
headlong
from
the
room
striking
heavily
against
the
passage
wall
outside
there
was
a
groan
then
his
footsteps
slumped
away
into
silence
ugh
grunted
waldemar
come
back
average
jones
reentered
have
you
no
curiosity
in
your
composition
he
asked
not
much
having
been
reared
in
the
newspaper
stooping
average
jones
picked
up
the
glasses
which
the
man
had
thrown
on
the
floor
and
examined
them
carefully
rather
a
fine
instrument
he
observed
marked
i
think
i
follow
up
the
you
never
find
him
now
he
has
too
much
not
at
all
when
a
man
is
in
his
state
of
abject
funk
it
ten
to
one
he
lands
at
the
nearest
bar
wait
for
in
fifteen
minutes
average
jones
was
back
there
was
a
curious
expression
on
his
face
as
he
nodded
an
assent
to
his
friend
inquiring
eyebrows
where
asked
waldemar
on
the
floor
of
a
park
row
dead
drunk
eh
no
er
not
er
drunk
waldemar
stiffened
in
his
chair
dead
he
repeated
poison
probably
the
ad
was
his
finish
as
he
said
the
next
thing
is
to
find
the
first
edition
will
be
down
any
minute
now
but
it
take
some
finding
why
counting
we
carrying
fifteen
hundred
ads
in
every
issue
with
no
clue
to
the
character
of
this
one
plenty
of
clue
said
average
jones
suavely
you
find
it
on
the
sporting
page
i
judging
from
the
man
appearance
rather
is
it
judging
from
a
pair
of
very
fine
binoculars
a
mention
of
carroll
morrison
name
and
principally
some
two
thousand
dollars
in
a
huge
i
do
quite
see
where
that
no
the
bills
must
have
been
mostly
ones
and
twos
those
are
a
takings
the
binocular
is
a
glass
our
late
friend
used
the
language
of
the
track
i
think
we
find
him
on
page
try
said
waldemar
handing
him
a
paper
still
spicy
with
the
keen
odor
of
printer
ink
swiftly
the
practiced
eye
ran
over
the
column
it
checked
at
the
offer
of
a
notorious
firm
of
tipsters
who
advertised
to
sell
inside
information
on
the
races
to
their
patrons
as
a
special
lure
they
were
on
this
day
letting
the
public
in
on
a
few
particularly
good
things
free
there
you
are
said
average
jones
pointing
out
the
advertisement
to
his
astonishment
waldemar
noted
that
his
friend
indicatory
finger
shook
a
little
normally
average
jones
was
the
coolest
and
most
controlled
of
men
noble
and
gale
form
ad
he
observed
i
see
nothing
unusual
in
yet
er
i
fancy
it
quite
important
er
in
its
the
editor
stared
when
you
talk
like
a
bored
britisher
average
he
remarked
there
sure
to
be
something
in
the
air
what
is
it
look
at
the
last
again
waldemar
turned
to
the
paper
best
bet
he
read
the
pharisee
will
never
finish
well
that
the
pharisee
will
never
finish
repeated
average
jones
if
the
pharisee
is
a
horse
the
line
becomes
absurd
at
once
how
could
any
one
know
that
a
horse
would
fail
to
finish
in
a
race
but
if
it
er
referred
er
to
a
man
an
official
known
er
as
pharisee
phil
wait
waldemar
had
jumped
to
his
feet
a
thrill
increasing
and
pulsating
through
the
floor
beneath
them
shook
the
building
the
editor
jumped
for
the
telephone
composing
room
quick
give
me
the
foreman
hello
that
you
corrigan
stop
the
presses
i
do
care
if
we
miss
every
train
in
the
country
do
answer
back
this
is
waldemar
stop
the
presses
the
thrill
waned
and
ceased
at
the
telephone
waldemar
continued
look
up
the
noble
and
gale
tip
ad
page
nine
column
six
kill
the
last
line
the
one
best
bet
do
ask
me
how
chisel
it
out
burn
it
out
dynamite
it
out
but
kill
it
after
that
done
print
hello
dan
send
the
sporting
editor
in
here
in
a
good
work
said
average
jones
they
never
know
how
near
their
idea
of
removing
governor
arthur
came
to
being
boasted
of
in
plain
waldemar
took
his
huge
head
in
his
hands
and
rocked
it
gently
on
he
said
and
yet
it
tries
to
tell
me
that
a
man
plotting
to
murder
the
governor
advertises
the
fact
in
my
paper
i
get
a
new
keep
that
one
for
a
while
advised
average
jones
it
may
be
better
than
you
think
anyway
here
the
ad
and
down
yonder
is
the
dead
man
whom
it
killed
when
he
failed
to
kill
it
so
much
is
and
here
bendig
said
the
other
as
the
sporting
editor
entered
any
such
horse
as
pharisee
bendig
no
sir
i
suppose
you
mean
that
noble
and
gale
ad
i
saw
it
in
proof
some
of
nick
karboe
funny
work
i
nick
karboe
murmured
average
jones
laying
a
hand
on
the
abandoned
field
glass
who
is
this
man
karboe
bendig
junior
partner
of
noble
and
gale
he
puts
out
their
any
connection
whatever
with
carroll
morrison
why
yes
before
he
went
to
pieces
he
used
to
be
confidential
man
and
lately
he
been
doing
some
lobbying
for
the
association
i
understood
he
quit
it
quit
what
asked
waldemar
drink
worse
the
white
stuff
average
jones
whistled
softly
that
explains
it
all
he
said
a
cocaine
fiend
on
a
debauch
becomes
a
mental
and
moral
imbecile
it
would
be
perfectly
in
character
that
he
should
boast
of
a
projected
very
well
said
waldemar
after
the
sporting
editor
had
left
but
you
do
really
connect
morrison
with
this
do
i
at
least
i
propose
to
try
see
here
waldemar
two
months
ago
at
a
private
dinner
morrison
made
a
speech
in
which
he
said
that
men
who
interfered
with
the
rights
of
property
like
governor
arthur
were
no
better
than
anarchists
and
ought
to
be
handled
accordingly
therefore
i
do
think
that
a
plan
a
safe
one
of
course
to
put
phil
away
would
greatly
disturb
our
friend
distorted
conscience
you
see
the
governor
has
laid
impious
hands
on
holy
of
holies
the
dividend
by
the
way
where
is
governor
arthur
on
the
train
for
this
city
he
to
review
the
parade
at
the
harrisonia
centennial
and
unveil
the
statute
night
that
is
to
be
a
good
opportunity
murmured
average
jones
what
in
the
sight
of
a
hundred
thousand
people
that
might
be
the
very
core
of
the
opportunity
and
at
if
you
feel
certain
it
a
case
for
the
police
is
it
hardly
the
gambling
gang
control
the
police
wholly
they
would
destroy
the
trail
at
then
why
not
warn
the
governor
i
do
know
suppose
i
make
an
appointment
to
take
you
to
see
him
in
the
morning
this
was
agreed
upon
at
ten
governor
arthur
received
them
at
his
hotel
greeting
average
jones
with
flattering
warmth
you
the
amateur
detective
who
scared
the
honorable
william
linder
out
of
the
mayoralty
nomination
said
he
shaking
hands
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
me
give
you
some
racing
news
to
read
the
governor
took
the
advertisement
proof
and
read
it
carefully
characteristically
he
then
it
throughout
you
think
this
is
meant
for
me
he
asked
handing
it
back
i
do
you
not
exactly
what
one
would
call
popular
with
the
racing
crowd
you
know
mr
morrison
in
the
politest
manner
in
the
world
has
allowed
me
to
surmise
as
much
said
the
other
smiling
broadly
a
very
polished
person
morrison
he
can
make
threats
of
extinction
political
of
course
more
delicately
than
any
other
subtle
blackmailer
i
have
ever
met
and
i
have
met
several
in
my
if
this
were
merely
political
extinction
which
i
fancy
you
can
take
care
of
yourself
i
should
be
taking
up
your
time
my
dear
jones
a
friendly
hand
fell
on
the
visitor
shoulder
i
gravely
fear
that
you
lack
the
judicial
mind
it
a
great
thing
to
lack
at
governor
arthur
eyes
twinkled
again
and
his
visitor
wondered
whence
had
come
his
reputation
as
a
dry
unhumorous
man
as
to
assassination
he
pursued
i
a
sort
of
christian
scientist
the
best
protection
is
a
profound
conviction
that
you
safe
that
reacts
on
the
mind
of
any
assassin
to
my
mind
my
best
chance
of
safety
lies
in
never
thinking
of
then
said
waldemar
any
attempt
to
persuade
you
against
appearing
at
harrisonia
would
be
time
absolutely
my
dear
waldemar
but
do
think
that
i
not
appreciative
of
your
thoughtfulness
and
that
of
what
is
the
program
of
the
day
governor
asked
average
jones
rather
a
theatrical
one
i
to
ride
along
harrison
avenue
to
the
reviewing
stand
in
the
old
of
the
harrison
family
a
lofty
old
ark
high
as
a
circus
wagon
which
has
been
patched
up
for
the
occasion
just
before
i
reach
the
reviewing
stand
a
silk
cord
is
to
be
handed
to
me
and
i
am
to
pull
the
veil
from
the
great
civic
statue
with
that
as
i
move
then
i
think
that
waldemar
and
i
will
look
the
ground
over
could
we
get
you
by
telephone
sir
if
necessary
any
time
up
to
seven
what
do
you
think
of
the
chance
of
their
passing
the
bill
over
your
veto
asked
waldemar
they
are
spending
money
as
it
has
never
been
spent
before
replied
governor
arthur
i
admit
to
you
waldemar
that
if
i
could
find
any
legitimate
method
of
calling
morrison
off
i
would
not
scruple
to
use
it
it
is
of
course
morrison
money
that
we
are
possibly
er
that
too
er
might
be
done
drawled
average
jones
the
governor
looked
at
him
sharply
after
the
linder
affair
jones
said
he
i
would
follow
you
far
call
my
secretary
at
any
time
if
you
want
now
to
look
over
the
line
of
parade
said
average
jones
as
he
and
waldemar
emerged
from
the
hotel
half
an
hour
ride
brought
them
to
the
lively
suburban
city
of
harrisonia
gay
with
flags
and
bunting
from
the
railroad
station
where
the
guest
of
honor
was
to
be
met
by
the
old
coach
to
the
spot
where
the
civic
statue
awaited
its
unveiling
at
his
hands
was
about
half
a
mile
along
harrison
avenue
the
principal
street
the
walk
along
this
street
developed
nothing
of
interest
to
average
jones
until
they
reached
the
statue
here
he
paused
to
look
curiously
at
a
number
of
square
platforms
built
out
from
windows
in
the
business
blocks
for
outfits
explained
waldemar
one
of
them
is
our
eh
said
average
jones
and
there
be
fireworks
and
the
air
will
be
full
of
light
and
noise
under
cover
of
which
almost
anything
might
be
done
i
do
like
it
hello
what
here
he
turned
to
the
glass
front
of
a
cigar
store
on
the
south
side
of
the
avenue
and
pointed
to
a
shattered
hole
in
the
window
behind
it
a
bullet
swung
on
a
thread
from
the
ceiling
and
this
agent
of
disaster
the
proprietor
had
ingeniously
turned
to
account
in
advertising
by
the
following
placard
aim
lower
if
you
expect
to
shoot
holes
in
our
prices
we
challenge
our
competition
not
bad
approved
average
jones
i
feel
a
great
yearning
to
smoke
they
entered
the
store
and
were
served
by
the
proprietor
as
he
was
making
change
average
jones
asked
when
was
the
bombardment
night
before
last
some
time
replied
the
man
done
by
a
deflected
bullet
was
it
have
any
idea
how
it
was
done
or
why
i
got
here
in
the
morning
and
there
she
was
what
makes
you
think
it
was
a
deflected
bullet
because
it
was
whirling
normally
a
bullet
bores
a
pretty
clean
hole
in
plate
that
so
too
agreed
the
man
with
some
interest
average
jones
handed
a
cigar
to
waldemar
and
lighted
one
himself
puffing
at
it
as
he
walked
to
the
door
he
gazed
casually
around
and
finally
centered
his
attention
on
a
telegraph
pole
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
he
even
walked
out
and
around
the
pole
returning
he
remarked
to
the
tobacconist
very
good
cigars
these
ever
advertise
the
man
displayed
a
tin
square
vaunting
the
virtues
of
his
outside
the
shop
i
meant
why
would
one
of
those
signs
look
good
on
that
telegraph
pole
it
would
look
good
to
me
said
the
vendor
but
it
would
look
good
to
the
telegraph
people
they
have
it
oh
i
do
know
give
me
one
lend
me
a
ladder
and
i
make
the
the
tobacconist
stared
all
right
he
said
go
as
far
as
you
and
he
got
the
required
articles
for
his
customer
with
silent
curiosity
waldemar
watched
average
jones
place
the
ladder
against
the
outside
of
the
pole
mount
nail
up
the
sign
drop
a
improvised
from
a
key
and
a
length
of
string
to
the
ground
set
a
careful
knot
in
the
string
and
return
to
earth
what
did
you
find
asked
the
editor
four
holes
that
you
could
cover
with
a
silver
dollar
some
gunnery
that
then
how
did
the
other
shot
happen
to
go
so
far
do
you
see
that
steel
work
over
there
average
jones
pointed
across
to
the
north
side
of
the
street
just
opposite
where
a
number
of
buildings
had
been
torn
down
to
permit
of
the
erection
of
a
new
one
the
frame
had
risen
three
stories
and
through
the
open
spaces
in
the
gaunt
skeleton
the
rear
of
the
houses
facing
on
the
street
next
northward
could
be
seen
waldemar
indicated
that
he
did
see
the
edifice
pointed
out
by
average
jones
the
bullet
came
from
back
of
that
perhaps
from
the
next
street
they
sighted
by
the
telegraph
pole
suppose
now
a
man
riding
in
a
high
coach
passes
along
this
avenue
between
the
pole
and
the
gun
operator
over
yonder
to
the
northward
every
one
of
the
bullets
which
hit
the
pole
would
have
gone
right
through
his
body
probably
a
fixed
gun
as
for
the
wide
shot
we
as
he
spoke
the
was
leading
the
way
across
the
street
with
upturned
face
he
carefully
studied
the
steel
joists
from
end
to
end
presently
he
pointed
following
the
line
of
his
finger
waldemar
saw
a
raw
scar
on
the
under
side
of
one
of
the
joists
there
it
is
said
average
jones
the
sights
were
a
trifle
off
at
the
first
shot
and
the
bullet
ticked
the
steel
and
so
far
so
good
approved
waldemar
i
can
approximate
the
height
of
the
steel
beam
from
the
ground
close
enough
for
a
trial
formula
continued
average
jones
now
waldemar
i
call
your
attention
to
that
restaurant
on
the
opposite
waldemar
conned
the
designated
building
with
attention
well
he
said
finally
what
of
it
i
do
see
anything
wrong
with
precisely
my
point
returned
the
with
a
grin
neither
do
i
therefore
suppose
you
go
there
and
order
luncheon
for
two
while
i
walk
down
to
the
next
block
and
back
again
i
be
with
you
in
four
he
was
somewhat
better
than
his
word
dropping
into
the
chair
opposite
his
friend
he
figured
swiftly
and
briefly
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
which
he
returned
to
his
pocket
i
suppose
you
done
a
vast
amount
of
investigating
since
you
left
me
remarked
the
editor
sardonically
meanwhile
the
plot
to
murder
the
governor
goes
merrily
i
done
a
fair
amount
of
pacing
over
distance
retorted
average
jones
imperturbably
as
for
the
governor
they
ca
kill
him
till
he
comes
can
they
besides
there
plenty
of
time
for
them
to
change
their
minds
as
a
result
of
my
little
constitutional
just
now
and
a
simple
exercise
in
mathematics
you
and
i
will
call
at
a
house
on
spencer
street
the
next
street
north
after
what
house
ah
that
i
do
know
as
yet
we
see
when
we
get
comfortably
fed
the
two
strolled
up
to
spencer
street
and
turned
into
it
average
jones
eying
the
upper
windows
of
the
houses
he
stopped
in
front
of
an
frame
structure
which
was
built
on
a
different
plan
of
floor
level
from
its
smaller
neighbors
of
brick
up
the
low
steps
went
jones
followed
by
the
editor
an
aged
lady
of
the
species
commonly
conjectured
as
maiden
opened
the
door
madam
said
average
jones
could
we
rent
your
third
floor
rear
for
this
evening
no
sir
said
she
it
perhaps
i
could
buy
the
renters
off
suggested
jones
could
i
see
them
both
out
she
answered
shortly
and
i
do
believe
you
could
get
the
room
from
them
for
they
all
fixed
up
to
take
photographs
of
the
drawled
average
jones
in
accents
so
prolonged
even
for
him
that
waldemar
interest
flamed
within
him
i
er
ra
hoped
er
when
do
you
expect
them
back
about
four
thank
you
please
tell
them
that
er
nick
karboe
for
heaven
sake
average
rumbled
waldemar
as
they
regained
the
pavement
why
did
you
use
the
dead
man
name
it
gave
me
a
it
give
them
a
worse
one
replied
the
grimly
i
want
to
prepare
their
nerves
for
a
subsequent
shock
if
you
meet
me
here
this
evening
at
seven
i
think
i
can
promise
you
a
queer
and
meantime
on
that
point
i
want
your
advice
shall
we
make
a
sure
catch
of
two
hired
assassins
who
do
amount
to
much
or
take
a
chance
at
the
bigger
game
meaning
morrison
meaning
morrison
incidentally
if
we
get
him
we
be
able
to
kill
the
personal
liberty
bill
so
dead
it
will
never
raise
its
head
then
i
for
that
course
decided
the
editor
after
a
little
consideration
though
i
ca
yet
make
myself
believe
that
carroll
morrison
is
party
to
a
deliberate
murder
how
the
normal
mind
does
shrink
from
connecting
crime
with
good
clothes
and
a
social
position
remarked
the
just
give
me
a
the
moment
he
spent
jotting
down
words
on
a
bit
of
paper
which
after
some
emendation
he
put
away
that
do
for
a
heading
he
remarked
now
waldemar
i
want
you
to
get
the
governor
on
the
and
tell
him
if
he
follow
directions
we
put
the
personal
liberty
bill
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
morrison
is
to
be
in
the
reviewing
stand
is
he
yes
there
a
special
place
reserved
for
him
next
the
press
good
by
the
way
you
better
send
for
two
press
seats
for
you
and
myself
now
what
i
want
the
governor
to
do
is
this
get
a
copy
of
the
harrisonia
evening
bell
fold
it
to
an
advertisement
headed
to
photographers
and
as
he
passes
carroll
morrison
on
the
stand
hold
it
up
and
say
to
him
just
this
luck
next
time
for
anything
further
i
see
you
in
the
reviewing
stand
do
you
think
he
do
it
it
sounds
as
foolish
as
a
college
initiation
stunt
still
you
heard
what
governor
arthur
said
about
his
confidence
in
you
but
what
is
this
advertisement
as
yet
it
is
but
it
will
be
as
soon
as
i
can
get
to
the
office
of
the
bell
you
meet
me
on
this
corner
at
seven
then
yes
meantime
to
be
safe
i
look
after
the
reviewing
stand
tickets
at
the
hour
named
the
editor
arrived
average
jones
was
already
there
accompanied
by
a
messenger
boy
the
boy
wore
the
cheerful
grin
of
one
who
has
met
with
an
unexpected
favor
of
fortune
they
returned
both
of
said
average
jones
as
waldemar
approached
what
about
the
governor
it
took
a
mighty
lot
of
persuasion
but
he
do
it
replied
the
editor
skip
son
said
the
handing
the
messenger
boy
a
folded
newspaper
the
two
gentlemen
on
the
third
floor
rear
and
be
sure
you
say
that
it
a
personal
marked
the
boy
crossed
the
street
and
entered
the
house
in
two
minutes
he
emerged
nodded
to
average
jones
and
walked
away
five
minutes
passed
then
the
front
door
opened
cautiously
and
a
tall
man
slunk
into
the
vestibule
a
second
man
followed
him
they
glanced
eagerly
from
left
to
right
average
jones
stepped
out
to
the
here
the
message
from
karboe
he
called
my
god
gasped
the
tall
man
for
an
instant
he
made
as
if
to
turn
back
then
clearing
the
steps
at
one
jump
he
stumbled
sprawled
was
up
again
instantly
and
speeding
up
the
street
away
from
average
jones
turned
the
corner
neck
and
neck
with
his
companion
who
running
powerfully
had
overtaken
him
the
door
of
the
house
stood
ajar
before
waldemar
had
recovered
from
his
surprise
average
jones
was
inside
the
house
hesitation
beset
the
editor
should
he
follow
or
wait
he
paused
one
foot
on
the
step
a
loud
crash
within
resolved
his
doubts
up
he
started
when
the
voice
of
average
jones
in
colloquy
with
the
woman
who
had
received
them
before
checked
him
the
colloquy
seemed
excited
but
peaceful
presently
average
jones
came
down
the
steps
they
left
the
ad
said
he
have
you
seen
it
no
i
had
time
to
get
a
paper
replied
waldemar
taking
the
copy
extended
to
him
and
reading
in
large
display
offer
to
photographers
reward
for
special
photo
of
governor
arthur

be
taken
according
to

and
specifications
designated

the
late

karboe

to

new
york
city
no
wonder
they
ran
said
waldemar
with
a
grin
as
he
digested
this
document
and
so
must
we
if
we
to
get
through
the
crowd
and
reach
the
reviewing
stand
warned
average
jones
glancing
at
his
watch
their
seats
which
they
attained
with
some
difficulty
were
within
a
few
feet
of
the
governor
box
within
reach
of
them
sat
carroll
morrison
his
long
pale
face
set
in
that
immobility
to
which
he
had
schooled
it
but
the
cold
eyes
roved
restlessly
and
the
little
muscles
at
the
corners
of
the
lips
twitched
tell
me
that
he
is
in
on
the
game
whispered
average
jones
and
waldemar
nodded
the
sound
of
music
from
down
the
street
turned
all
faces
in
that
direction
a
roar
of
cheering
swept
toward
them
and
was
taken
up
in
the
stands
the
governor
in
his
high
coach
came
in
sight
and
at
that
moment
terror
struck
into
the
soul
of
waldemar
suppose
they
came
back
he
whispered
to
average
jones
we
left
the
house
i
fixed
that
replied
the
in
the
same
tone
watch
morrison
governor
arthur
approached
the
civic
statue
an
official
running
out
to
the
coach
handed
him
a
silken
cord
which
he
secured
with
a
turn
around
the
wrist
the
coach
rolled
on
the
cord
tautened
the
swathings
sundered
and
fell
from
the
gleaming
splendor
of
marble
and
a
blinding
flash
followed
by
another
and
a
third
blotted
out
the
scene
in
unbearable
radiance
involuntarily
morrison
like
thousands
of
others
had
screened
his
sight
with
his
hands
after
the
second
flash
now
as
the
kindlier
light
returned
he
half
rose
rubbing
his
eyes
furiously
a
escaped
him
he
sank
back
staring
in
amaze
for
governor
arthur
was
riding
on
calm
and
smiling
amid
the
shouts
morrison
shrank
could
it
be
that
the
governor
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
he
strove
to
shake
off
the
delusion
he
felt
rather
than
saw
the
guest
of
honor
descend
from
the
coach
felt
rather
than
saw
him
making
straight
toward
himself
and
he
winced
and
quivered
at
the
sound
of
his
own
name
mr
morrison
the
governor
was
saying
at
his
elbow
mr
morrison
here
is
a
paper
that
may
interest
you
better
luck
next
morrison
strove
to
reply
his
voice
clucked
in
his
throat
and
the
hand
with
which
he
took
the
folded
newspaper
was
as
the
hand
of
a
paralytic
he
broken
whispered
average
jones
he
went
straight
to
governor
arthur
speaking
in
his
ear
the
governor
nodded
average
jones
returned
to
his
seat
to
watch
carroll
morrison
who
sat
with
of
fear
scorching
him
until
the
last
band
had
blared
its
way
into
silence
again
the
governor
was
speaking
to
him
morrison
i
want
you
to
visit
a
house
near
here
jones
and
waldemar
will
come
along
you
know
them
perhaps
please
do
protest
i
positively
will
not
take
a
refusal
we
have
a
furious
but
not
daring
to
refuse
morrison
found
himself
whirled
swiftly
away
and
after
a
few
turns
to
shake
off
the
crowd
into
spencer
street
with
his
captors
he
mounted
to
the
third
floor
of
an
old
frame
house
the
rear
room
door
had
been
broken
in
inside
stood
a
strange
instrument
resembling
a
large
camera
which
had
once
stood
upright
on
a
steel
tripod
riveted
to
the
floor
the
legs
of
the
tripod
were
twisted
and
bent
a
chair
near
by
suggested
the
agency
of
destruction
just
to
render
it
harmless
explained
average
jones
it
formerly
pointed
through
that
window
so
that
a
bullet
from
the
barrel
would
strike
that
pole
way
yonder
in
harrison
street
after
first
passing
through
any
intervening
body
yours
for
instance
do
i
understand
that
this
is
a
gun
jones
asked
that
official
of
a
sort
replied
the
opening
up
the
and
showing
a
large
barrel
superimposed
on
a
smaller
one
this
is
a
he
explained
tapping
the
larger
barrel
and
this
tapping
the
smaller
carries
a
small
but
efficient
bullet
this
curious
sheath
he
pointed
to
a
cylindrical
jacket
around
part
of
the
rifle
barrel
is
a
coulomb
silencer
which
reduces
a
report
almost
to
a
whisper
here
is
an
electric
button
which
was
connected
with
yonder
battery
before
i
operated
on
it
with
the
chair
and
distributed
its
spark
part
to
the
gun
part
to
the
powder
on
this
little
shelf
do
you
see
the
plan
now
the
instant
that
the
governor
riding
through
the
street
yonder
is
sighted
through
this
glass
the
operator
presses
the
button
and
and
bullet
go
off
but
why
the
asked
the
governor
merely
a
blind
to
fool
the
landlady
and
avert
any
possible
suspicion
they
had
told
her
that
they
had
a
new
invention
to
take
at
a
distance
amidst
the
other
flashes
this
one
would
be
noticed
particularly
they
had
covered
their
trail
well
indeed
said
the
governor
may
i
congratulate
you
morrison
on
this
interesting
achievement
in
ballistics
as
there
is
no
way
of
properly
resenting
an
insult
from
a
man
in
your
position
said
morrison
venomously
i
will
reserve
my
answer
to
that
outrageous
meantime
put
in
average
jones
let
me
direct
your
attention
to
a
simple
mathematical
he
drew
from
his
pocket
an
envelope
on
which
were
drawn
some
angles
subjoined
by
a
formula
morrison
waved
it
aside
not
interested
in
mathematics
asked
average
jones
solicitously
very
well
i
elucidate
informally
given
a
bullet
hole
in
a
telegraph
pole
at
a
certain
distance
a
bullet
scar
on
an
iron
girder
at
a
certain
lesser
distance
and
the
length
of
a
block
from
here
to
harrison
avenue
which
i
paced
off
while
you
were
skillfully
ordering
luncheon
waldemar
and
an
easy
triangulation
brings
us
direct
to
this
room
and
to
two
fugitive
gentlemen
with
whom
i
mention
the
hypothesis
with
all
deference
morrison
you
are
probably
and
who
may
they
have
been
retorted
morrison
contemptuously
i
do
know
said
average
jones
then
sir
retorted
the
racing
king
your
hypothesis
is
as
impudent
as
your
company
is
intolerable
have
you
anything
further
to
say
to
me
yes
it
would
greatly
please
waldemar
to
publish
in
paper
an
authorized
statement
from
you
to
the
effect
that
the
personal
liberty
bill
will
be
withdrawn
mr
waldemar
may
go
to
the
devil
i
have
endured
all
the
hectoring
i
propose
to
men
in
my
position
are
targets
for
muckrakers
and
blackmailers
wait
a
moment
waldemar
heavy
voice
broke
in
you
speak
of
men
in
your
position
do
you
understand
just
what
position
you
are
in
at
present
morrison
rose
governor
arthur
he
said
with
with
stony
dignity
i
bid
you
good
waldemar
set
his
bulky
back
against
the
door
the
lips
drew
back
from
morrison
strong
teeth
with
the
snarl
of
an
animal
in
the
fury
and
terror
of
approaching
peril
do
you
know
nick
karboe
morrison
whirled
about
to
face
average
jones
but
he
did
not
answer
the
question
he
only
stared
carroll
morrison
continued
average
jones
in
his
quiet
drawl
the
before
he
er
committed
suicide
er
nick
karboe
spent
in
the
office
of
the
er
universal
with
waldemar
and
er
myself
catch
him
waldemar
for
morrison
had
wilted
they
propped
him
against
the
wall
and
he
the
man
who
had
insolently
defied
the
laws
of
a
great
commonwealth
who
had
bribed
legislatures
and
bossed
judges
and
browbeaten
the
public
slobbered
denied
and
begged
for
two
disgustful
minutes
they
extracted
from
him
his
solemn
promise
that
henceforth
he
would
keep
his
hands
off
the
laws
then
they
turned
him
out
suppose
you
enlighten
me
with
the
story
gentlemen
suggested
the
governor
average
jones
told
it
simply
and
modestly
at
the
conclusion
governor
arthur
looked
from
the
wrecked
to
the
mathematical
formula
which
had
fallen
to
the
floor
mr
jones
he
said
you
done
me
the
service
of
saving
my
life
you
done
the
public
the
service
of
killing
a
vicious
bill
i
wish
i
could
thank
you
more
publicly
than
thank
you
governor
said
average
jones
modestly
but
i
owed
the
public
something
you
know
on
account
of
my
uncle
the
late
mayor
van
governor
arthur
nodded
the
debt
is
paid
he
said
that
knowledge
must
be
your
reward
that
and
the
consciousness
of
having
worked
out
a
remarkable
and
original
original
said
average
jones
eying
the
diagram
on
the
back
with
his
quaint
smile
why
governor
you
giving
me
too
much
credit
it
was
worked
out
by
one
of
the
greatest
detectives
of
all
time
some
two
thousand
years
ago
his
name
was
chapter
xi
the
dog
to
this
day
average
jones
maintains
that
he
felt
a
distinct
thrill
at
first
sight
of
the
advertisement
yet
fate
might
well
have
chosen
a
more
appropriate
ambush
in
any
one
of
a
hundred
of
the
strange
clippings
which
were
grist
to
the
mill
out
of
a
bulky
pile
of
the
day
paragraphs
however
it
was
this
one
that
leaped
significant
to
his
eye
wanted
ten
thousand
loathly
black
beetles
by
a
leaseholder
who
contracted
to
leave
a
house
in
the
same
condition
as
he
found
it
ackroyd
sixteenth
new
york
black
beetles
eh
observed
average
jones
this
ackroyd
person
seems
to
be
a
merry
little
jester
well
i
feeling
rather
jocular
myself
this
morning
how
does
one
collect
black
beetles
i
wonder
when
in
doubt
inquire
of
the
resourceful
he
pressed
a
button
and
his
confidential
clerk
entered
good
morning
simpson
said
average
jones
are
you
acquainted
with
that
shy
but
pervasive
animal
the
domestic
black
beetle
yes
sir
i
board
said
simpson
simply
i
suppose
there
are
ten
thousand
black
beetles
in
your
though
inquired
average
jones
simpson
took
it
under
advisement
hardly
he
decided
i
got
to
have
to
fill
an
order
at
least
i
got
to
have
an
installment
of
and
being
wholly
without
imagination
the
confidential
clerk
was
impervious
to
surprise
or
shock
this
was
fortunate
for
otherwise
his
employment
as
practical
aide
to
average
jones
would
probably
have
driven
him
into
a
madhouse
he
now
ran
his
long
thin
clerkly
hands
through
his
long
thin
clerkly
hair
ramson
down
on
fulton
street
will
have
them
if
any
one
has
he
said
presently
he
does
business
under
the
title
of
the
insect
nemesis
you
know
i
go
there
at
returning
to
his
routine
work
average
jones
found
himself
unable
to
dislodge
the
advertisement
from
his
mind
so
presently
he
gave
way
to
temptation
called
up
bertram
at
the
cosmic
club
and
asked
him
to
come
to
the
astor
court
temple
office
at
his
convenience
scenting
more
adventure
bertram
found
it
convenient
to
come
promptly
average
jones
handed
him
the
clipping
bertram
read
it
with
ascending
eyebrows
hoots
he
said
the
man
i
did
ask
you
here
to
diagnose
the
advertiser
trouble
plain
enough
though
you
made
a
bad
guess
what
i
want
of
you
is
to
tap
your
flow
of
information
about
old
new
york
what
at
one
hundred
west
sixteenth
street
one
hundred
west
sixteenth
let
me
see
why
of
course
it
the
old
feltner
mansion
you
must
know
it
it
has
a
walled
garden
at
the
side
the
only
one
left
in
the
city
south
of
central
any
one
named
ackroyd
there
that
must
be
hawley
ackroyd
i
remember
now
hearing
that
he
had
rented
it
judge
ackroyd
you
know
better
known
as
ackroyd
a
smooth
old
indeed
what
particular
sort
oh
most
sorts
in
private
professionally
he
a
legislative
crook
head
lobbyist
of
the
ever
hear
of
his
collecting
insects
never
heard
of
his
collecting
anything
but
graft
in
fact
he
have
been
in
jail
years
ago
but
for
his
family
connections
he
married
a
van
haltern
you
remember
the
famous
van
haltern
will
case
surely
the
dog
the
papers
fairly
reeked
of
it
a
year
ago
sylvia
graham
had
to
take
the
dog
and
leave
the
country
to
escape
the
notoriety
she
back
now
i
i
heard
of
miss
graham
remarked
average
jones
through
friends
of
mine
whom
she
well
if
you
only
heard
of
her
and
not
seen
her
returned
bertram
with
something
as
nearly
resembling
enthusiasm
as
his
habitual
languor
permitted
you
got
something
to
look
forward
to
sylvia
graham
is
a
distinct
asset
to
the
scheme
of
an
asset
with
assets
of
her
own
i
believe
said
average
jones
the
million
dollars
left
by
her
grandmother
old
van
haltern
goes
to
her
eventually
does
it
provided
she
carries
out
the
terms
of
the
will
keeps
the
dog
in
proper
luxury
and
buries
him
in
the
grave
on
the
family
estate
at
schuylkill
designated
by
the
testator
if
these
terms
are
not
rigidly
carried
out
the
fortune
is
to
be
divided
most
of
it
going
to
hawley
ackroyd
which
would
mean
the
judge
himself
i
should
say
that
the
dog
was
as
good
as
sausage
meat
if
ever
gets
hold
of
h
what
about
ackroyd
poor
sickly
frightened
lady
she
very
fond
of
sylvia
graham
who
is
her
niece
but
she
completely
dominated
by
her
information
is
your
long
suit
bert
now
if
you
only
had
intelligence
to
correspond
average
jones
broke
off
and
grinned
mildly
first
at
his
friend
then
at
the
advertisement
bertram
caught
up
the
paper
and
studied
it
well
what
does
it
mean
he
demanded
it
means
that
ackroyd
being
about
to
give
up
his
rented
house
intends
to
saddle
it
with
a
bad
name
probably
he
had
a
row
with
the
agent
or
owner
and
is
getting
even
by
making
the
place
difficult
to
rent
again
nobody
wants
to
take
a
house
with
the
reputation
of
an
entomological
it
would
be
just
like
oily
ackroyd
remarked
bertram
he
a
vindictive
scoundrel
only
a
few
days
ago
he
nearly
killed
a
poor
devil
of
a
drug
clerk
over
some
trifling
dispute
he
managed
to
keep
it
out
of
the
newspapers
but
he
had
to
pay
a
stiff
that
might
be
worth
looking
up
too
ruminated
average
jones
thoughtfully
he
turned
to
his
telephone
in
answer
to
a
ring
all
right
come
in
simpson
he
said
the
confidential
clerk
appeared
ramson
says
that
regular
black
beetles
are
out
of
season
sir
he
reported
but
he
can
send
to
the
country
and
dig
up
plenty
of
that
will
do
returned
the
tell
him
to
have
two
or
three
hundred
here
bertram
bent
a
severe
gaze
on
his
friend
meaning
that
you
going
to
follow
up
this
freak
affair
he
inquired
just
that
i
ca
explain
why
but
well
bert
i
a
hunch
at
the
worst
ackroyd
face
when
he
sees
the
beetles
should
be
worth
the
when
you
frivol
average
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
but
i
warn
you
look
out
for
ackroyd
he
as
big
as
he
is
ugly
a
tough
all
right
i
just
put
on
some
old
clothes
to
dress
the
part
of
a
correctly
and
also
in
case
i
get
torn
in
my
meeting
with
judge
i
see
you
later
and
report
if
i
survive
his
thus
it
was
that
on
the
morning
after
this
dialogue
a
young
fellow
walked
along
west
sixteenth
street
appreciatively
sniffing
the
sunny
crispness
of
the
may
air
he
was
rather
shabby
looking
yet
his
demeanor
was
by
no
means
shabby
it
was
confident
and
easy
on
the
evidence
of
the
bandbox
which
he
carried
his
mission
should
have
been
menial
but
he
bore
himself
wholly
unlike
one
subdued
to
petty
employments
his
steady
gray
eyes
showed
a
glint
of
anticipation
as
he
turned
in
at
the
gate
of
the
high
broad
brown
house
standing
back
aloof
and
indignant
from
the
roaring
encroachments
of
trade
he
set
his
burden
down
and
pulled
the
bell
the
door
opened
promptly
to
the
deep
clangor
a
flashing
impression
of
girlish
freshness
vigor
and
grace
was
disclosed
to
the
caller
against
a
background
of
interior
gloom
he
stared
a
little
more
patently
than
was
polite
whatever
his
expectation
of
amusement
this
evidently
was
not
the
manifestation
looked
for
the
girl
glanced
not
at
him
but
at
the
box
and
spoke
a
trifle
impatiently
if
it
my
hat
it
very
late
you
should
have
gone
to
the
it
is
miss
said
the
young
man
in
a
form
of
address
the
of
which
seemed
distinctly
out
of
tone
with
the
quietly
clear
and
assured
voice
it
the
the
what
the
bugs
he
extracted
from
his
pocket
a
slip
of
paper
looked
from
it
to
the
numbered
door
as
one
verifying
an
address
and
handed
it
to
her
from
yesterday
copy
of
the
banner
miss
you
not
going
back
on
that
surely
he
said
somewhat
reproachfully
she
read
and
as
she
read
her
eyes
widened
to
lakes
of
limpid
brown
then
they
crinkled
at
the
corners
and
her
laugh
rose
from
the
contralto
to
a
high
trill
of
joyousness
the
infection
of
it
tugged
at
the
young
man
throat
but
he
successfully
preserved
his
mask
of
flat
and
respectful
dullness
it
must
have
been
uncle
she
gasped
finally
he
said
he
be
quits
with
the
real
estate
agent
before
he
left
how
perfectly
absurd
and
are
those
the
creatures
in
that
box
the
first
couple
of
hundred
of
two
hundred
again
the
access
of
laughter
swelled
the
rounded
bosom
as
the
breeze
fills
a
sail
where
did
you
get
them
woodpile
said
the
young
man
stolidly
any
particular
kind
preferred
miss
ackroyd
the
girl
looked
at
him
with
suspicion
but
his
face
was
blankly
innocent
i
not
miss
ackroyd
she
began
with
emphasis
when
a
querulous
voice
from
an
inner
room
called
out
whom
are
you
talking
to
sylvia
a
young
man
with
a
boxful
of
beetles
returned
the
girl
adding
in
brisk
french
il
est
tres
amusant
ce
farceur
je
ne
le
comprends
pas
du
tout
cest
une
blague
si
on
dans
la
maison
pour
un
moment
through
one
of
the
considerately
punched
in
the
cardboard
cover
of
the
box
a
sturdy
crawler
had
succeeded
in
pushing
himself
he
was
in
the
main
of
a
shiny
and
black
but
two
large
patches
of
crimson
gave
him
the
festive
appearance
of
being
garbed
in
a
brilliant
sash
as
he
stood
rubbing
his
together
in
over
his
exploit
his
bearer
addressed
him
in
french
quite
as
ready
as
the
girl
monsieur
le
colioptere
de
vous
presenter
mes
excuses
pour
cette
demoiselle
qui
en
langue
etrangere
chez
do
apologize
to
the
beetle
on
my
account
retorted
the
girl
with
spirit
you
here
on
your
own
terms
you
know
both
of
average
jones
mutely
held
up
the
box
in
one
hand
and
the
advertisement
in
the
other
the
flourished
a
farewell
to
the
girl
with
his
antennae
and
retired
within
to
advise
his
fellows
of
the
charms
of
freedom
very
well
said
the
girl
in
demure
tones
though
lambent
mirth
still
flickered
golden
in
the
depths
of
the
brown
eyes
if
you
persist
i
can
only
suggest
that
you
come
back
when
judge
ackroyd
is
here
you
wo
find
him
particularly
amenable
to
humor
particularly
when
perpetrated
by
a
practical
joker
in
discovered
murmured
average
jones
i
should
have
vaunted
my
poor
french
but
must
i
really
take
my
little
friends
all
the
way
back
you
suggested
to
the
mystic
voice
within
that
i
might
be
invited
you
seem
a
decidedly
unconventional
person
began
the
other
with
dawning
disfavor
conventionality
like
charity
begins
at
home
he
replied
quickly
and
one
would
hardly
call
this
advertisement
a
pattern
of
formal
true
enough
she
admitted
dimpling
and
average
jones
was
congratulating
himself
on
his
diplomacy
when
the
querulous
voice
broke
in
again
this
time
too
low
for
his
ears
i
do
ask
you
the
real
reason
for
your
extraordinary
call
pursued
the
girl
with
a
glint
of
mischief
in
her
eyes
after
she
had
responded
in
an
aside
but
auntie
thinks
you
come
to
steal
my
dog
she
thinks
that
of
every
one
auntie
your
dog
then
you
sylvia
graham
i
might
have
known
i
do
know
how
you
might
have
known
it
but
i
am
sylvia
graham
if
you
insist
on
introducing
me
to
miss
graham
said
the
visitor
promptly
and
gravely
let
me
present
jones
a
friend
not
the
famous
average
jones
cried
the
girl
that
is
why
your
face
seemed
so
familiar
i
seen
your
picture
at
edna
hale
you
got
her
fires
back
for
her
but
really
that
hardly
explains
your
being
here
in
this
way
you
frankly
miss
graham
it
was
just
as
a
lark
that
i
answered
the
advertisement
but
now
that
i
here
and
find
you
here
it
looks
er
as
if
it
might
er
be
more
a
tinge
of
pink
came
into
the
girl
cheeks
but
she
answered
lightly
enough
indeed
it
may
for
you
if
uncle
finds
you
here
with
those
never
mind
me
or
the
beetles
i
like
to
know
about
the
dog
that
your
aunt
is
worrying
over
is
he
here
with
you
the
soft
curve
of
miss
graham
lips
straightened
a
little
i
really
think
she
said
with
decision
that
you
had
better
explain
further
before
nothing
simpler
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
a
young
don
quixote
who
wandered
through
an
age
of
buried
romance
piously
searching
for
trouble
and
twice
upon
a
time
there
dwelt
in
an
enchanted
stone
castle
in
west
sixteenth
street
an
enchanting
young
damsel
in
distress
i
not
a
damsel
in
distress
interrupted
miss
graham
passing
over
the
adjective
the
young
man
leaned
to
her
the
half
smile
had
passed
from
his
lips
and
his
eyes
were
very
grave
not
er
if
your
dog
were
to
er
disappear
he
drawled
quietly
the
swift
unexpectedness
of
the
counter
broke
down
the
girl
guard
you
mean
uncle
hawley
she
said
and
your
suspicions
jump
with
they
do
she
denied
hotly
you
very
unjust
and
i
do
mean
to
be
impertinent
he
said
evenly
and
i
have
no
monopoly
of
what
do
you
know
about
uncle
hawley
your
aunt
i
wo
hear
a
word
against
my
not
from
me
be
assured
your
aunt
so
you
have
just
told
me
believes
that
your
dog
is
in
danger
of
being
stolen
why
because
she
knows
that
the
person
most
interested
has
been
scheming
against
the
animal
and
yet
she
is
afraid
to
warn
you
openly
does
that
indicate
who
it
is
mr
jones
i
no
right
even
to
let
you
talk
like
this
to
me
have
you
anything
definite
against
judge
ackroyd
in
this
case
only
her
head
went
up
then
i
think
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
the
young
man
flushed
but
his
voice
was
steady
as
he
returned
i
disagree
with
you
and
i
beg
you
to
cut
short
your
visit
here
and
return
to
your
home
at
in
spite
of
herself
the
girl
was
shaken
by
his
persistence
i
ca
do
that
she
said
uneasily
and
added
with
a
flash
of
anger
i
think
you
had
better
leave
this
if
i
leave
this
house
now
i
may
never
have
any
chance
to
see
you
the
girl
regarded
him
with
level
eyes
and
i
have
every
intention
of
seeing
you
again
and
again
and
again
give
me
a
chance
a
average
jones
mind
was
of
the
emergency
type
it
summoned
to
its
aid
without
effort
of
cerebration
on
the
part
of
its
owner
whatever
was
most
needed
at
the
moment
now
it
came
to
his
rescue
with
the
memory
of
judge
ackroyd
encounter
with
the
drug
clerk
as
mentioned
by
bertram
there
was
a
strangely
hopeful
suggestion
of
some
link
between
a
quarrel
and
the
arrival
of
a
dog
better
dead
in
the
hopes
of
his
host
miss
graham
i
gone
rather
far
i
admit
said
jones
but
if
you
give
me
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
i
think
i
can
show
you
some
basis
to
work
on
if
i
can
produce
something
tangible
may
i
come
back
here
this
afternoon
i
promise
not
to
come
unless
i
have
good
very
well
conceded
miss
graham
reluctantly
it
a
most
unusual
thing
but
i
agree
to
au
revoir
then
he
said
and
was
gone
somewhat
to
her
surprise
and
uneasiness
sylvia
graham
experienced
a
distinct
satisfaction
when
late
that
afternoon
she
beheld
her
unconventional
acquaintance
mounting
the
steps
with
a
buoyant
and
assured
step
upon
being
admitted
he
went
promptly
to
the
point
i
got
your
justification
for
coming
back
she
asked
exactly
have
you
heard
anything
of
some
trouble
in
which
judge
ackroyd
was
involved
last
week
uncle
has
a
very
violent
temper
admitted
the
girl
evasively
but
i
do
see
what
pardon
me
you
will
see
that
row
was
with
a
drug
in
an
obscure
drug
store
several
blocks
from
the
drug
clerk
insisted
as
the
law
requires
on
judge
ackroyd
registering
for
a
certain
perhaps
he
was
impertinent
about
possibly
the
point
is
that
the
prospective
purchase
was
cyanide
of
potassium
a
deadly
and
instantaneous
are
you
sure
asked
the
girl
in
a
low
voice
i
just
come
from
the
store
how
long
have
you
been
here
at
your
uncle
a
then
just
about
the
time
of
your
coming
with
the
dog
your
uncle
undertook
to
obtain
a
swift
and
sure
poison
have
i
gone
far
enough
i
i
do
well
am
i
still
ordered
out
of
the
house
thank
you
for
your
enthusiastic
hospitality
said
average
jones
so
dryly
that
a
smile
relaxed
the
girl
troubled
face
with
that
encouragement
we
go
on
what
is
your
uncle
attitude
toward
the
dog
almost
what
you
might
call
ingratiating
but
peter
paul
that
my
dog
name
you
know
does
take
to
uncle
he
a
crotchety
old
he
a
wise
old
doggie
amended
the
other
with
emphasis
has
your
uncle
taken
him
out
at
all
once
he
tried
to
i
met
them
at
the
corner
all
four
of
peter
poor
old
fat
legs
were
braced
and
he
was
hauling
back
as
hard
as
he
could
against
the
and
the
occurrence
did
strike
you
as
peculiar
well
not
when
does
your
uncle
give
up
this
house
at
the
end
of
the
week
uncle
and
aunt
leave
for
then
let
me
suggest
again
that
you
and
peter
paul
go
at
miss
graham
pondered
that
would
mean
explanations
and
a
quarrel
and
more
strain
for
auntie
who
is
nervous
enough
anyway
no
i
ca
do
do
you
realize
that
every
day
peter
paul
remains
here
is
an
added
opportunity
for
judge
ackroyd
to
make
a
million
dollars
or
a
big
share
of
it
by
some
very
simple
stratagem
i
have
admitted
yet
that
i
believe
my
uncle
to
be
a
a
murderer
miss
graham
quietly
reminded
him
a
strong
word
said
average
jones
smiling
the
law
would
hardly
support
your
view
now
miss
graham
would
it
grieve
you
very
much
if
peter
paul
were
to
die
i
wo
have
him
put
to
death
said
she
quickly
that
would
be
cheating
my
grandmother
i
supposed
you
would
yet
it
would
be
the
simplest
way
once
dead
and
buried
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
will
the
dog
would
be
out
of
his
troubles
and
you
would
be
out
of
it
would
really
be
a
relief
peter
paul
suffers
so
from
asthma
poor
old
beastie
the
vet
says
he
can
live
only
a
month
or
two
longer
anyway
but
i
got
to
do
as
grandmother
wished
and
keep
peter
paul
alive
as
long
as
average
jones
fell
into
a
baffled
silence
studying
the
pattern
of
the
rug
with
restless
eyes
when
he
looked
up
into
miss
graham
face
again
it
was
with
a
changed
expression
miss
graham
he
said
slowly
wo
you
try
to
forget
for
the
moment
the
circumstances
of
our
meeting
and
think
of
me
only
as
a
friend
of
your
friends
who
is
very
honestly
eager
to
be
a
friend
to
you
when
you
most
need
one
now
average
jones
had
endowed
him
with
one
priceless
gift
the
power
of
inspiring
an
instinctive
confidence
in
himself
sylvia
graham
felt
suddenly
that
a
hand
sure
and
firm
had
been
outstretched
to
guide
her
on
a
dark
path
in
one
of
those
rare
flashes
of
companionship
which
come
only
when
clean
and
honorable
spirits
recognize
one
another
all
consciousness
of
sex
was
lost
between
them
the
girl
gaze
met
the
man
level
and
was
held
in
a
long
silent
regard
yes
she
said
simply
and
the
heart
of
average
jones
rose
and
swore
a
high
loyalty
listen
then
i
think
i
see
a
clear
way
judge
ackroyd
will
kill
the
dog
if
he
can
and
so
effectually
conceal
the
body
that
no
funeral
can
be
held
over
it
thereby
rendering
your
grandmother
bequest
to
you
void
he
has
only
a
few
days
to
do
it
in
but
i
do
think
that
all
your
watchfulness
can
restrain
him
now
on
the
other
hand
if
the
dog
should
die
a
natural
death
and
be
buried
he
can
still
contest
the
will
but
if
he
should
kill
peter
paul
and
hide
the
body
where
we
could
discover
it
the
game
would
be
up
for
him
as
he
then
would
even
dare
to
come
into
court
with
a
contest
do
you
follow
me
yes
but
you
would
ask
me
to
be
a
party
to
any
such
you
a
party
involuntarily
by
remaining
here
but
do
your
best
to
save
peter
paul
if
you
will
and
please
call
me
up
immediately
at
the
cosmic
club
if
anything
in
my
line
turns
what
is
your
line
asked
miss
graham
the
smile
returning
to
her
lips
creepy
crawly
bugs
or
imperiled
dogs
or
rescuing
prospectively
distressed
damsels
technically
it
advertising
replied
average
jones
who
had
been
formulating
a
shrewd
little
plan
of
his
own
let
me
recommend
to
you
the
advertising
columns
of
the
daily
press
they
often
amusing
moreover
your
uncle
might
break
out
in
print
again
who
knows
who
indeed
i
read
and
by
the
way
my
beetles
i
forgot
and
left
them
here
oh
the
box
i
may
have
a
very
specific
use
for
them
later
au
revoir
and
may
it
be
soon
the
two
days
succeeding
seemed
to
average
jones
haunted
as
he
was
by
an
importunate
craving
to
look
again
into
miss
graham
limpid
and
changeful
eyes
a
dull
and
sodden
period
of
probation
the
messenger
boy
who
finally
brought
her
expected
note
looked
to
him
like
a
greek
godling
the
note
enclosed
this
clipping
dog
answering
to
the
name
of
peter
paul
very
old
and
asthmatic
last
seen
on
west
street
liberal
reward
for
information
to
anxious
care
of
banner
office
dear
jones
she
had
written
are
you
a
prophet
average
jones
chuckled
at
this
point
the
enclosed
seems
to
be
distinctly
in
our
line
could
you
come
some
time
this
afternoon
i
puzzled
and
a
little
anxious
sincerely
yours
sylvia
graham
average
jones
could
and
did
he
found
miss
graham
piquant
face
under
the
stress
of
excitement
distinctly
more
alluring
than
before
is
it
strange
she
said
holding
out
a
hand
in
welcome
why
should
any
one
advertise
for
my
peter
paul
he
is
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
said
the
caller
gravely
i
kept
my
promise
you
see
pursued
the
girl
can
you
do
as
well
and
live
up
to
your
profession
of
aid
try
very
well
do
you
know
what
that
advertisement
means
then
you
a
very
extraordinary
not
in
the
least
i
wrote
wrote
it
you
well
really
why
in
the
world
did
you
write
it
because
of
an
unconquerable
longing
to
see
average
jones
paused
and
his
quick
glance
caught
the
storm
signal
in
her
eyes
your
uncle
he
concluded
calmly
for
one
fleeting
instant
a
dimple
flickered
at
the
corner
of
her
mouth
it
departed
but
departing
it
swept
the
storm
before
it
what
do
you
want
to
see
uncle
about
if
it
is
an
impertinent
question
it
is
rather
returned
the
young
man
judicially
particularly
as
i
not
sure
myself
i
may
want
to
quarrel
with
you
wo
have
the
slightest
difficulty
in
that
the
girl
assured
him
she
rang
the
bell
dispatched
a
servant
and
presently
judge
ackroyd
stalked
into
the
room
as
average
jones
was
being
presented
he
took
comprehensive
note
and
estimate
of
the
face
the
square
shoulders
and
corded
neck
and
the
lithe
and
formidable
carriage
of
the
man
judge
oily
ackroyd
greeting
of
the
guest
within
his
gates
did
not
bear
out
the
sobriquet
of
his
public
life
it
was
curt
to
the
verge
of
harshness
what
is
the
market
quotation
on
beetles
judge
asked
the
young
man
tapping
the
rug
with
his
stick
what
are
you
talking
about
demanded
the
other
drawing
down
his
heavy
brows
the
black
beetle
the
humble
but
brisk
haunter
of
household
crevices
explained
average
jones
you
advertised
for
ten
thousand
specimens
i
got
a
few
thousand
i
like
to
dispose
of
if
the
inducements
are
i
in
no
mood
for
joking
young
man
retorted
the
other
rising
you
seldom
are
i
understand
replied
average
jones
blandly
well
if
you
wo
talk
about
bugs
let
talk
about
the
topic
does
not
interest
me
sir
retorted
the
other
and
the
glance
of
his
eye
was
baleful
but
uneasy
the
tapping
of
the
young
man
cane
ceased
he
looked
up
into
his
glowering
face
with
a
seraphic
and
innocent
smile
not
even
if
it
er
touched
upon
a
device
for
guarding
the
street
corners
in
case
er
peter
paul
went
walking
er
once
too
often
judge
ackroyd
took
one
step
forward
average
jones
was
on
his
feet
instantly
and
even
in
her
alarm
sylvia
graham
noticed
how
swiftly
and
naturally
his
whole
form
but
the
big
man
turned
away
and
abruptly
left
the
room
were
you
wise
to
anger
him
asked
the
girl
as
the
heavy
tread
died
away
on
the
stairs
sometimes
open
declaration
of
war
is
the
soundest
war
she
repeated
you
make
me
feel
like
a
traitor
to
my
own
that
the
unfortunate
part
of
it
he
said
but
it
ca
be
you
spoke
of
having
some
one
guard
the
corners
of
the
block
continued
the
girl
after
a
thoughtful
silence
do
you
think
i
better
arrange
for
that
no
need
there
be
a
hundred
people
on
have
you
called
out
the
militia
she
asked

better
than
that
i
employed
the
tools
of
my

handed
her
a
galley
proof
marked
with
many
corrections
she
ran
through

growing
amazement

said
the

any
one
who
attempts
to
take
peter
paul
away
will
be
tracked
by
a
band
of
boy
detectives
a
stroke
of
genius
average
she
curtsied
low
to
him
but
average
jones
was
in
no
mood
for
playfulness
now
that
restricts
the
judge
endeavors
to
the
house
and
garden
said
he
since
of
course
he
see
the
i
see
that
he
does
said
miss
graham
maliciously
good
i
also
ask
you
to
watch
the
garden
for
any
suspicious
very
well
but
is
that
all
miss
graham
voice
was
wistful
is
it
enough
you
been
so
good
to
me
she
said
hesitantly
i
do
like
to
think
of
you
as
setting
those
boys
to
an
impossible
oh
bless
you
returned
the
heartily
that
all
arranged
for
one
of
my
men
will
duly
parade
with
a
canine
especially
obtained
for
the
occasion
i
not
going
to
swindle
the
it
did
seem
like
you
returned
miss
graham
warmly
but
you
must
let
me
pay
for
it
that
and
the
advertising
as
an
unauthorized
expense
he
began
she
laid
a
small
persuasive
hand
on
his
arm
you
must
let
me
pay
it
wo
you
average
jones
was
conscious
of
a
strange
sensation
starting
from
the
point
where
the
firm
little
hand
lay
it
spread
in
his
veins
and
thickened
his
speech
of
course
he
drawled
uncertainly
if
you
er
put
it
er
that
way
the
hand
lifted
mr
average
jones
said
the
owner
do
you
know
you
have
once
disappointed
me
in
speech
or
action
during
our
short
but
rather
eventful
acquaintance
i
hope
you
be
able
to
say
the
same
ten
years
from
now
he
returned
significantly
she
flushed
a
little
at
the
implication
what
am
i
to
do
next
she
asked
do
as
you
would
ordinarily
do
only
do
take
peter
paul
into
the
street
or
you
have
a
score
of
boys
trailing
you
and
this
is
the
most
important
if
the
dog
fails
to
answer
your
call
at
any
time
and
you
ca
readily
find
him
by
searching
telephone
me
at
once
at
my
office
i
think
you
are
a
very
staunch
friend
to
those
who
need
you
she
said
gravely
and
sweetly
giving
him
her
hand
she
clung
in
his
mind
like
a
remembered
fragrance
after
he
had
gone
back
to
astor
court
temple
to
wait
and
though
he
plunged
into
an
intricate
scheme
of
political
advertising
which
was
to
launch
a
new
local
party
her
eyes
and
her
voice
haunted
him
nor
had
he
banished
them
when
two
days
later
the
telephone
brought
him
her
clear
accents
a
little
tremulous
now
peter
paul
is
since
when
since
ten
this
morning
the
house
is
in
an
i
be
up
in
half
an
hour
at
the
do
come
quickly
i
i
a
little
then
you
must
have
something
to
do
said
average
jones
decisively
have
you
been
keeping
an
eye
on
the
garden
go
through
it
again
looking
carefully
for
signs
of
disarranged
earth
i
do
think
you
find
it
but
it
well
to
be
sure
let
me
in
at
the
basement
door
at
one
judge
ackroyd
must
see
it
was
a
strangely
misshapen
presentation
of
the
normally
average
jones
that
gently
rang
the
basement
bell
of
the
old
house
at
the
specified
hour
all
his
pockets
bulged
with
lumpy
angles
immediately
upon
being
admitted
by
miss
graham
herself
he
proceeded
to
disenburden
himself
of
box
after
box
such
as
elastic
bands
come
in
all
exhibiting
a
homogeneous
peculiarity
a
hole
at
one
end
thinly
covered
with
a
gelatinous
substance
be
very
careful
not
to
let
that
get
broken
he
instructed
the
mystified
girl
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
so
it
will
melt
away
itself
did
you
see
anything
suspicious
in
the
garden
no
replied
the
girl
she
picked
up
one
of
the
boxes
how
odd
she
cried
why
there
something
in
it
that
alive
very
much
so
your
friends
the
beetles
in
what
again
are
you
carrying
the
joke
rather
far
it
not
a
joke
any
more
it
deadly
serious
i
quite
sure
he
concluded
in
the
manner
of
one
who
picks
his
words
carefully
that
it
may
turn
out
to
be
just
the
most
serious
matter
in
the
world
to
as
bad
as
that
she
queried
but
the
color
that
flamed
in
her
cheeks
belied
the
lightness
of
her
tone
quite
however
that
must
wait
where
is
your
uncle
in
his
do
you
think
you
could
take
me
all
through
the
house
sometime
this
afternoon
without
his
seeing
me
no
i
sure
i
could
he
been
wandering
like
an
uneasy
spirit
since
peter
paul
disappeared
and
he
wo
go
out
because
he
is
so
much
the
worse
either
for
him
or
me
where
are
your
rooms
on
the
second
very
well
now
i
want
one
of
these
little
boxes
left
in
every
room
in
the
house
if
possible
except
on
your
floor
which
is
probably
out
of
the
reckoning
do
you
think
you
could
manage
it
soon
i
think
so
i
do
most
of
the
rooms
open
into
one
another
yes
all
through
the
please
see
that
they
all
unlocked
and
as
far
as
possible
open
i
be
here
at
four
and
will
call
for
judge
ackroyd
you
must
be
sure
that
he
receives
me
tell
him
it
is
a
matter
of
great
importance
it
you
putting
a
fearful
strain
on
my
feminine
curiosity
said
miss
graham
the
provocative
smile
quirking
at
the
comers
of
her
mouth
doubtless
returned
the
other
dryly
if
you
strictly
follow
directions
i
undertake
to
satisfy
it
in
time
four
sharp
i
be
here
do
be
frightened
whatever
happens
you
keep
ready
but
out
of
the
way
until
i
call
you
with
even
more
than
his
usual
nicety
was
average
jones
attired
when
at
four
he
sent
his
card
to
judge
ackroyd
small
favor
however
did
his
appearance
find
in
the
scowling
eyes
of
the
judge
what
do
you
want
he
growled
i
take
a
cigar
thank
you
very
much
said
average
jones
innocently
you
take
your
leave
or
state
your
it
has
to
do
with
your
then
what
do
you
take
my
time
for
damn
your
do
average
jones
was
deliberately
provoking
the
older
man
to
an
outbreak
let
er
sit

and
er
be
the
drawl
actually
an
evidence
of
excitement
had
all
the
effect
of
studied
insolence
judge
ackroyd
big
frame
shook
i
going
to
you
out
into
the
street
you
young
he
stuttered
in
his
rage
his
knotted
fingers
writhed
out
for
a
hold
on
the
other
collar
with
a
sinuous
movement
the
visitor
swerved
aside
and
struck
the
other
man
across
the
face
there
was
an
answering
howl
of
demoniac
fury
then
a
strange
thing
happened
the
assailant
turned
and
fled
not
to
the
ready
egress
of
the
front
door
but
down
the
dark
stairway
to
the
basement
the
judge
thundered
after
in
maddened
unthinking
pursuit
average
jones
ran
fleetly
and
easily
and
his
running
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
flight
alone
for
as
he
sped
through
the
basement
rooms
he
kept
casting
swift
glances
from
side
to
side
and
up
and
down
the
walls
the
heavyweight
pursuer
could
not
get
nearer
than
half
a
dozen
paces
from
the
kitchen
average
jones
burst
into
the
hallway
doubled
back
up
the
stairs
and
made
a
tour
of
the
big
and
of
the
first
floor
here
too
his
glance
swept
room
after
room
from
floor
to
ceiling
the
chase
then
led
upward
to
the
second
floor
and
by
direct
ascent
to
the
third
breathing
heavily
judge
ackroyd
lumbered
after
the
more
active
man
in
his
dogged
rage
he
never
thought
to
stop
and
block
the
but
trailed
his
quarry
like
a
bloodhound
through
every
room
of
the
third
floor
and
upward
to
the
fourth
up
this
stairway
average
jones
checked
his
speed
and
surveyed
the
hall
above
as
he
started
again
he
stumbled
and
sprawled
a
more
competent
observer
than
the
infuriated
pursuer
might
have
noticed
that
he
fell
cunningly
but
judge
ackroyd
gave
a
shout
of
savage
triumph
and
increased
his
speed
he
stretched
his
hand
to
grip
the
fugitive
it
had
almost
touched
him
when
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
resumed
his
flight
i
get
you
now
panted
the
judge
the
fourth
floor
of
the
old
house
was
almost
bare
in
a
hung
a
mirror
all
along
the
borders
of
this
average
quick
ranging
vision
had
discerned
small
objects
which
moved
and
shifted
as
the
glass
reflected
his
extended
figure
it
showed
almost
at
the
same
instant
the
outstretched
bony
hand
of
oily
ackroyd
with
a
snarl
half
rage
half
satisfaction
the
pursuer
hurled
himself
forward
and
fell
with
a
plunge
that
rattled
the
house
old
bones
for
as
he
reached
jones
trained
on
many
a
field
had
whirled
and
dived
at
his
knees
before
the
fallen
man
could
gather
his
shaken
wits
he
was
pinned
with
the
most
disabling
grip
known
in
the
science
of
combat
a
with
the
assailant
wrist
clamped
in
below
and
behind
the
ear
average
jones
lifted
his
voice
and
the
name
that
came
to
his
lips
was
the
name
that
had
lurked
subconsciously
in
his
heart
for
days
sylvia
he
cried
the
fourth
floor
come
there
was
a
stir
and
a
cry
from
two
floors
below
sylvia
graham
had
broken
from
the
grasp
of
her
terrified
aunt
and
now
came
up
the
sharp
ascent
like
a
deer
her
eyes
blazing
with
resolve
and
courage
the
mirror
said
average
jones
push
it
aside
pull
it
down
get
behind
it
somehow
lie
quiet
ackroyd
or
i
have
to
choke
your
worthless
head
with
an
effort
of
nervous
strength
the
girl
lifted
aside
the
big
glass
behind
it
a
hundred
scarlet
banded
insects
swarmed
and
scampered
it
a
panel
open
she
tugged
at
the
woodwork
with
quick
clever
fingers
a
section
loosened
and
fell
outward
with
a
bang
the
beetles
fled
in
all
directions
and
now
judge
ackroyd
found
his
voice
help
he
roared
murder
the
sinewy
pressure
of
average
jones
wrist
smothered
further
attempts
at
vocality
to
a
gurgle
he
looked
up
into
sylvia
graham
tense
face
and
jerked
his
head
toward
the
opening
unless
my
little
detectives
have
deceived
me
he
said
you
find
the
body
in
she
groped
and
drew
forth
a
large
box
in
it
was
packed
the
body
of
peter
paul
there
was
a
cord
about
the
fat
neck
strangled
whispered
the
girl
poor
old
doggie
then
she
whirled
upon
the
prostrate
man
you
murderer
she
said
very
low
it
not
murder
to
put
a
dying
brute
out
of
the
way
said
the
shaken
man
sullenly
but
it
fraud
in
this
case
retorted
average
jones
a
fraud
of
which
you
get
he
himself
rose
and
stepped
back
but
his
eye
was
intent
and
his
muscles
were
in
readiness
there
was
no
more
fight
in
judge
oily
ackroyd
he
slunk
to
the
stairs
and
limped
heavily
down
to
his
frightened
and
sobbing
wife
miss
graham
leaned
against
the
wall
white
and
spent
average
jones
his
heart
in
his
eyes
took
a
step
forward
no
she
said
peremptorily
do
touch
me
i
shall
be
all
do
you
mind
my
saying
said
he
very
low
that
you
are
the
bravest
and
finest
human
being
i
met
in
a
a
somewhat
varied
the
girl
shuddered
i
could
have
stood
it
all
she
said
but
for
those
awful
crawling
red
those
said
average
jones
why
they
were
my
bloodhounds
my
little
detectives
there
nothing
very
awful
about
those
sylvia
they
done
their
work
as
nature
gave
to
do
it
i
knew
that
as
soon
as
they
got
out
they
would
find
the
and
what
are
they
carrion
beetles
said
average
jones
where
the
vultures
of
the
insect
kingdom
are
gathered
together
there
the
quarry
sylvia
graham
drew
a
long
breath
i
all
right
now
she
pronounced
there
nothing
left
i
suppose
but
to
leave
this
house
and
to
thank
you
how
am
i
ever
to
thank
you
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
never
mind
the
thanks
said
average
jones
unevenly
it
was
it
was
everything
it
was
wonderful
cried
the
girl
and
held
out
her
slender
hands
to
him
as
they
clasped
warmly
upon
his
average
jones
reason
lost
its
balance
he
forgot
that
he
was
in
that
house
on
an
equivocal
footing
he
forgot
that
he
had
exposed
and
disgraced
sylvia
graham
near
relative
he
forgot
that
this
was
but
his
third
meeting
with
sylvia
graham
herself
he
forgot
everything
except
that
the
sum
total
of
all
that
was
sweetest
and
finest
and
most
desirable
in
womanhood
stood
warm
and
vivid
before
him
and
bending
over
the
little
clinging
hands
he
pressed
his
lips
to
them
only
for
a
moment
the
hands
slipped
from
his
there
was
a
quick
frightened
gasp
and
the
girl
face
all
aflush
with
a
new
sweet
fearfulness
and
wondering
confusion
vanished
behind
a
ponderous
swinging
door
the
young
man
knees
shook
a
little
as
he
walked
forward
and
put
his
lips
close
to
the
lintel
there
was
a
faint
rustle
from
within
i
sorry
i
mean
i
glad
gladder
than
of
anything
i
ever
done
in
my
silence
from
within
if
i
frightened
you
forgive
me
i
could
help
it
it
was
stronger
than
i
this
is
the
place
where
i
can
tell
you
sylvia
i
going
no
answer
the
work
is
done
he
continued
you
wo
need
me
any
did
he
hear
from
within
a
faint
indrawn
breath
not
for
any
help
that
i
can
give
but
i
i
shall
need
you
always
and
long
for
you
listen
there
must
be
any
misunderstanding
about
this
dear
if
you
send
for
me
it
must
be
because
you
want
me
knowing
that
when
i
come
i
shall
come
for
you
it
was
the
merest
whisper
from
behind
the
door
but
it
echoed
in
the
tones
of
a
thousand
golden
hopes
and
dismal
fears
in
the
whirling
brain
of
average
jones
as
he
walked
back
to
his
offices
two
days
later
he
sat
at
his
desk
in
a
murk
of
woe
nor
word
nor
sign
had
come
to
him
from
miss
sylvia
graham
he
frowned
heavily
as
simpson
entered
the
inner
sanctum
with
the
usual
packet
of
clippings
leave
them
he
ordered
yes
the
confidential
clerk
lingered
looking
uncomfortable
anything
from
yesterday
lot
sir
have
looked
them
over
or
day
before
have
taken
those
up
pardon
me
mr
but
are
you
ill
sir
no
snapped
average
jones
ramson
is
inquiring
whether
he
shall
ship
more
beetles
i
see
in
the
paper
that
judge
ackroyd
has
sailed
for
europe
on
six
hours
notice
so
i
suppose
you
wo
want
any
more
average
jones
mentioned
a
destination
for
rawson
beetles
deeper
than
they
had
ever
digged
for
prey
yes
sir
assented
simpson
but
if
i
might
suggest
there
a
very
interesting
advertisement
in
yesterday
paper
repeated
this
morn
i
do
want
to
see
no
sir
but
but
still
it
it
seems
to
have
a
strange
reference
to
the
burial
of
the
dog
and
an
invitation
that
i
thought
where
is
it
give
it
to
me
for
once
in
his
life
high
pressure
of
excitement
had
blotted
out
average
jones
drawl
his
employee
thrust
into
his
hand
this
announcement
from
the
banner
of
that
morning
west
street
peter
paul
a
dog
for
many
years
the
faithful
and
fond
companion
of
the
late
amelia
van
haltern
burial
in
accordance
with
the
wish
and
will
of
van
haltern
at
the
family
estate
schuylkill
at
his
friend
don
quixote
is
especially
bidden
to
come
if
he
will
average
jones
leaped
to
his
feet
my
parable
he
cried
don
quixote
and
the
damsel
in
distress
where
my
hat
where
the
get
a
cab
simpson
you
idiot
why
did
you
make
me
read
this
before
confound
you
i
mean
god
bless
you
your
salary
doubled
from
i
yes
sir
said
the
bewildered
simpson
but
about
ramson
beetles
tell
him
to
turn
out
to
pasture
and
keep
as
long
as
they
live
at
my
expense
called
back
average
jones
as
the
door
slammed
behind
him
miss
sylvia
graham
looked
down
upon
a
slender
finger
ornamented
with
the
oddest
and
the
most
appropriate
of
engagement
rings
a
scarab
beetle
with
three
rubies
but
average
she
said
and
the
golden
laughter
flickered
again
in
the
brown
depths
of
her
eyes
not
even
you
could
expect
a
girl
to
accept
a
man
through
a
i
suppose
not
said
average
jones
with
a
sigh
of
profoundest
content
some
are
for
privacy
in
these
matters
others
for
publicity
but
i
suppose
i
the
first
man
in
history
who
ever
got
his
heart
answer
in
an
the
end
