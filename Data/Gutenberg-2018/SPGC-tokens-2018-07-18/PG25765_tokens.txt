my
two
dixie
neighbors
whose
entertaining
tales
of
their
childhood
escapades
have
helped
to
make
these

this
first
volume
of
the
dixie
girl
is
most
affectionately
inscribed
by
their
friend
j
chapter
i
full
speed
for
four
corners
four
straight
country
roads
running
at
right
angles
you
can
not
see
where
they
begin
because
they
have
their
beginning
over
the
hills
and
far
away
but
you
can
see
where
they
end
at
four
corners
the
hub
of
that
universe
for
there
stand
the
general
store
which
is
also
the
postoffice
the
tavern
as
it
is
called
in
that
part
of
the
world
the
church
the
rectory
and
perhaps
a
dozen
private
dwellings
four
corners
is
oddly
because
there
are
no
corners
there
at
all
it
is
a
circle
maybe
it
was
originally
four
corners
but
today
it
is
certainly
a
circle
with
a
big
open
space
in
the
center
and
in
the
very
middle
of
that
stands
a
flag
staff
upon
which
floats
the
stars
and
stripes
the
whole
open
space
is
covered
with
the
softest
green
turf
a
lawn
mind
you
such
as
one
may
see
in
almost
any
immaculately
kept
northern
town
with
artistic
flower
beds
dotting
it
and
a
carefully
trimmed
border
of
foliage
plants
surrounding
it
no
this
circle
has
real
virginia
turf
the
thick
rich
indestructible
turf
one
finds
in
england
which
as
an
old
gardener
told
the
writer
we
rolls
and
tills
it
for
a
thousand
years
nature
had
been
rolling
and
tilling
this
green
plot
of
ground
for
a
good
many
thousand
years
the
circle
was
encompassed
by
an
iron
rail
fence
to
which
the
people
from
the
surrounding
community
hitched
their
saddle
or
carriage
horses
when
they
came
to
the
store
for
their
mail
or
to
make
various
purchases
and
there
the
beasties
often
stood
for
hours
rubbing
noses
and
exchanging
the
gossip
of
the
paddocks
horse
or
mule
fashion
there
were
always
several
hitched
there
and
they
were
always
gossiping
or
dozing
as
they
waited
for
their
owners
to
start
toward
home
and
they
represented
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
their
kind
just
as
those
owners
represented
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
some
were
young
men
some
some
old
some
were
of
the
gentry
of
the
surrounding
country
some
the
humbler
white
folk
some
the
negroes
who
had
managed
to
acquire
small
tracts
of
land
which
they
farmed
successfully
or
otherwise
among
them
too
was
the
typical
shiftless
triflin
darkey
who
jist
sits
though
it
would
be
hard
for
him
to
tell
what
he
was
waiting
for
nevertheless
the
corners
is
the
center
of
the
activities
of
that
community
though
to
make
those
who
most
frequently
gather
there
comprehend
the
limitations
of
its
activities
they
would
have
to
be
set
down
in
the
midst
of
some
big
hustling
city
still
some
who
go
to
the
corners
are
very
much
alive
to
this
fact
for
they
have
journeyed
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
their
own
land
and
many
other
lands
beside
but
they
do
not
tell
their
less
travelled
brothers
much
of
the
wonders
which
lie
beyond
the
towering
mountains
which
is
just
as
well
perhaps
the
might
be
less
happy
and
content
were
they
to
learn
of
the
doings
of
the
big
world
beyond
the
barriers
of
their
snug
peaceful
valley
which
seems
to
the
wiser
ones
so
far
away
from
the
trials
struggles
and
worries
of
the
world
beyond
and
curiously
enough
when
those
of
wider
knowledge
return
to
the
valley
they
find
again
the
peace
and
tranquility
which
they
left
there
and
breathing
a
sigh
of
relief
settle
back
into
its
restful
atmosphere
and
tranquil
content
as
one
settles
into
a
comfortable
old
chair
the
nearest
real
town
to
the
corners
is
sprucy
branch
and
that
is
fourteen
miles
from
luray
with
its
famous
caverns
to
reach
sprucy
branch
from
four
corners
one
must
drive
or
ride
a
right
smart
distance
and
then
to
reach
luray
take
a
railway
trip
or
drive
the
fourteen
miles
it
is
a
beautiful
part
of
this
big
world
and
the
valley
is
a
happy
one
moreover
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
more
delightful
little
social
world
than
its
gentlefolk
represent
not
the
formal
artificial
rigidly
conventional
social
world
of
the
big
northern
cities
where
few
have
time
or
inclination
to
be
absolutely
genuine
but
the
rare
true
social
life
of
the
southerner
to
whom
friendship
means
much
kinship
more
and
family
ties
everything
whose
sons
go
forth
into
the
world
to
make
their
mark
and
often
their
fortunes
too
yet
still
retain
the
charm
of
their
the
traditions
of
their
families
and
their
intense
love
of
the
home
back
yonder
whose
daughters
though
brought
up
raised
they
often
say
in
the
simplicity
of
country
life
and
more
often
than
not
having
very
limited
financial
resources
are
in
the
truest
sense
of
that
beautiful
old
word
the
gentlewomen
we
picture
prepared
to
grace
their
homes
or
the
outer
world
and
reflect
credit
upon
the
land
of
their
birth
and
this
is
the
conviction
of
her
northern
sister
the
first
of
nine
generations
to
be
born
beyond
the
borders
of
the
old
bay
state
so
she
can
hardly
be
accused
of
a
biased
opinion
and
this
lovely
september
morning
when
the
air
holds
just
the
faintest
suggestion
of
autumn
when
the
leaves
are
beginning
to
hint
of
richer
tints
than
the
soft
greens
which
they
have
worn
all
summer
when
the
native
birds
are
hobnobbing
and
gossiping
with
their
friends
who
are
journeying
farther
south
all
the
news
of
the
north
to
the
sunny
south
bringing
and
the
squirrels
are
chattering
and
scolding
as
they
gather
their
hoard
of
chinkapins
and
other
fodder
for
the
long
winter
at
hand
something
is
stirring
yes
stirring
vigorously
too
if
one
may
judge
by
the
hullabaloo
which
suddenly
arises
far
down
the
east
pike
the
people
gathered
upon
the
porch
at
the
store
prick
up
their
ears
to
listen
there
are
a
dozen
or
more
there
upon
one
errand
or
another
for
the
store
is
the
commercial
center
of
the
district
and
from
it
can
be
bought
or
ordered
every
nameable
thing
under
the
sun
it
is
also
the
postoffice
so
once
at
least
each
day
there
wends
his
or
her
way
to
it
every
human
being
who
expects
hopes
for
or
by
any
chance
may
receive
a
letter
it
was
mail
time
hence
the
number
of
people
gathered
about
to
prick
up
their
ears
as
the
racket
down
the
road
grew
louder
and
louder
each
second
and
the
thud
of
horses
hoofs
the
shouts
of
boys
voices
and
a
girl
ringing
laugh
were
borne
to
them
yonder
comes
the
woodbine
bunch
i
bet
a
dollar
and
they
sure
enough
it
up
too
reckon
that
young
one
of
the
old
is
the
pace
too
she
a
clipper
all
right
commented
a
man
seated
upon
a
chair
his
hat
pushed
far
back
upon
his
shock
head
he
was
guiltless
of
coat
and
his
jean
trousers
were
hitched
high
about
his
waist
by
a
pair
of
wool
suspenders
hardly
had
he
ceased
speaking
when
three
horses
came
pounding
into
view
the
leader
ridden
by
a
girl
about
fifteen
years
of
age
the
animal
was
a
little
beastie
with
white
markings
and
eyes
which
gave
a
pretty
strong
hint
of
a
good
bit
of
broncho
disposition
to
which
the
markings
also
pointed
he
was
lithe
and
agile
as
a
cat
and
moved
with
something
of
the
sinuous
gliding
of
that
animal
rather
than
the
bounding
motions
of
his
mates
the
two
horses
running
neck
and
neck
behind
him
were
evidently
blooded
animals
and
all
three
were
from
the
pace
set
by
their
leader
all
to
the
point
of
being
wholly
disreputable
for
a
shower
the
previous
night
had
left
many
a
wide
puddle
in
the
road
the
girl
leading
rode
as
only
a
southern
girl
accustomed
to
a
saddle
all
her
life
can
ride
the
saddle
was
of
the
mexican
type
but
the
headstall
was
the
lightest
possible
with
a
simple
snaffle
bit
even
that
seeming
almost
superfluous
for
she
guided
her
mount
more
by
the
motions
of
her
body
than
the
bridle
she
held
the
reins
at
arm
length
in
her
left
hand
while
with
her
right
she
waved
above
her
head
a
soft
felt
hat
her
banner
of
defiance
and
derision
of
her
pursuers
swaying
ever
so
slightly
in
her
saddle
she
brought
her
wiry
little
mount
up
to
the
platform
and
slid
from
his
back
as
snow
slides
from
a
hillside
the
reins
were
tossed
over
his
head
and
the
race
was
ended
running
across
the
porch
she
nodded
or
bowed
comprehensively
to
all
seated
or
standing
upon
it
the
greeting
accompanied
by
a
sunny
happy
smile
which
revealed
faultlessly
pretty
teeth
as
she
disappeared
within
the
store
her
friends
came
rushing
up
to
the
platform
shouting
after
her
as
they
drew
up
their
horses
here
come
back
hold
on
that
no
fair
even
if
you
did
beat
going
to
decide
the
kind
of
candy
you
do
us
out
of
our
last
cent
if
we
let
you
get
it
of
course
why
not
was
called
back
banteringly
do
you
think
i
going
to
run
apache
off
his
legs
risk
breaking
my
neck
and
then
not
have
the
in
the
end
i
reckon
not
it
just
to
be
chocolates
time
cinnamon
suckers
are
all
right
enough
for
a
little
race
but
this
was
a
one
and
besides
you
better
be
nice
to
me
while
you
have
the
chance
because
you
wo
have
me
with
you
very
much
longer
ah
cut
that
out
we
know
it
well
enough
you
need
rub
it
in
was
the
chorus
of
answers
shut
up
bev
added
the
taller
of
the
two
boys
a
fair
haired
lad
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
he
was
a
handsome
boy
with
eyes
of
such
a
deep
blue
that
they
seemed
violet
wavy
golden
hair
and
a
fine
clear
skin
though
it
was
tanned
many
shades
darker
than
nature
intended
it
to
be
the
nose
was
clean
cut
and
the
mouth
and
chin
indicated
considerable
strength
of
character
he
carried
himself
as
though
very
sure
of
his
place
in
the
world
and
his
intention
to
hold
it
nevertheless
the
face
was
a
cheery
happy
one
the
other
boy
was
so
like
the
girl
that
it
was
laughable
exchange
their
garments
and
it
would
have
puzzled
the
cleverest
person
to
tell
to
label
them
twins
would
have
been
superfluous
nature
had
attended
to
that
little
matter
fifteen
years
earlier
in
their
lives
and
even
their
old
mammy
used
to
say
now
don
none
of
yo
other
chillern

ter
projectin
wid

babies
whilst
i

haid

pintedly
an
den
i
gwine
ter
have
ter
spend
a
hull
hour
mebbe
my
mind
settled
pon
which
is
which
again
moreover
the
fifteen
years
of
daily
association
had
only
served
to
consummate
what
dame
nature
had
so
ably
begun
for
the
girl
and
the
boy
almost
thought
and
felt
in
unison
in
all
those
years
they
had
hardly
been
separated
for
a
day
that
is
no
further
than
a
strict
quarantine
beneath
the
same
roof
had
separated
them
and
that
had
been
entirely
beverly
doings
at
five
she
began
the
performance
by
contracting
at
seven
she
tried
mumps
at
nine
turned
a
beautiful
lobster
hue
from
measles
and
at
eleven
capped
the
climax
by
scaring
the
family
nearly
to
death
with
scarlet
fever
and
thereby
causing
her
grandfather
admiral
ashby
to
exclaim
lord
bless
my
soul
beverly
you
are
worse
than
the
potato
bugs
they
skip
the
fatal
second
year
now
and
again
but
you
never
let
up
perhaps
this
criticism
had
called
a
halt
in
her
performances
in
the
line
of
contagious
diseases
for
since
the
scarlet
fever
scare
she
had
quit
frightening
the
family
into
spasms
and
at
fifteen
was
as
charming
healthy
and
tantalizing
a
bit
of
girlhood
as
one
could
wish
to
see
though
about
as
much
of
a
tomboy
as
one
could
find
chapter
ii
woodbine
while
beverly
ashby
is
squabbling
with
her
brother
and
chum
suppose
we
take
this
opportune
moment
in
which
to
learn
something
about
the
trio
beverly
and
her
brother
athol
had
elected
to
enter
this
world
exactly
fifteen
years
and
four
months
prior
to
the
opening
of
this
story
they
also
chose
the
thirteenth
of
may
to
spring
their
first
surprise
upon
their
family
by
arriving
together
and
had
managed
to
sustain
their
reputations
for
surprising
the
grownups
by
never
permitting
a
single
year
to
pass
without
some
new
outbreak
though
it
must
be
admitted
that
beverly
could
certainly
claim
the
greater
distinction
of
the
two
in
that
direction
woodbine
their
home
had
been
the
family
seat
for
many
generations
it
had
seen
many
a
seldon
enter
this
world
and
many
a
one
depart
from
it
it
had
witnessed
the
outgoing
of
many
brides
from
its
broad
halls
and
seen
many
enter
to
become
its
mistress
it
was
a
wonderful
old
place
beautiful
stately
and
so
situated
upon
its
wooded
upland
that
it
commanded
a
magnificent
view
of
the
broad
valley
of
sprucy
stream
over
against
it
lay
the
foothills
of
the
blue
blue
mountains
the
blue
ridge
range
and
far
to
the
westward
the
peaks
of
the
alleghanies
peeped
above
the
massanutton
range
nearer
at
hand
the
valley
itself
was
like
a
rare
painting
the
silvery
stream
running
through
the
foreground
the
rich
woodlands
and
fertile
fields
the
marvelous
lights
and
shadows
ever
holding
the
one
looking
upon
it
entranced
and
all
this
lay
before
the
broad
acres
of
woodbine
so
named
because
that
graceful
vine
hung
in
rich
festoons
from
every
column
gallery
portico
and
even
the
eaves
to
which
it
had
climbed
a
delicate
adornment
in
early
spring
a
rich
darker
tone
in
midsummer
and
a
gorgeous
crimson
in
the
autumn
it
was
a
spacious
old
mansion
and
would
have
been
considered
a
large
one
even
in
the
north
where
during
the
past
fifty
years
palaces
have
sprung
into
existence
under
the
misnomer
of
cottages
happily
it
did
not
tower
up
into
the
air
as
many
of
the
cottages
do
but
spread
itself
comfortably
over
the
greensward
the
central
building
being
the
only
one
ambitious
enough
to
attain
to
two
stories
and
a
sharply
peaked
roof
in
which
were
set
several
dormer
windows
from
which
a
most
entrancing
view
of
the
valley
and
distant
mountain
ranges
could
be
obtained
these
dormer
window
chambers
were
rarely
used
and
excepting
during
the
house
cleaning
rarely
visited
that
one
of
these
rare
visits
should
have
been
paid
one
of
them
upon
this
particular
day
of
which
we
are
writing
was
simply
kismet
but
of
that
a
little
later
let
us
finish
our
picture
of
lovely
woodbine
across
the
entire
front
of
the
main
floor
as
well
as
the
second
story
ran
a
wide
piazza
gallery
they
call
it
in
that
part
of
the
country
the
lower
gallery
gave
upon
a
broad
velvety
lawn
dotted
with
elms
beeches
oaks
and
feathery
pines
no
path
led
to
this
gallery
and
when
one
stepped
from
it
one
feet
sank
into
the
softest
green
turf
the
door
which
opened
upon
it
fairly
spoke
hospitality
and
welcome
from
its
beautiful
arch
to
its
side
lights
and
the
hall
within
was
considered
one
of
the
more
perfect
specimens
of
the
architecture
of
its
period
to
be
found
in
the
state
as
was
the
stately
circular
double
stairway
leading
to
the
floor
above
half
way
up
upon
a
broad
landing
a
stained
glass
window
brought
long
long
ago
from
england
let
the
western
sunlight
filter
through
its
richly
tinted
panes
and
lie
in
patches
of
exquisite
color
upon
polished
stairs
and
floor
at
the
north
and
south
ends
of
the
house
were
the
real
entrances
from
the
carefully
raked
wide
driveway
which
described
almost
a
complete
circle
from
the
great
stone
gateway
half
a
mile
across
woodbine
lawn
could
this
driveway
have
run
straight
through
the
house
the
circle
would
have
been
perfect
but
it
had
to
stop
at
the
big
south
portico
with
its
graceful
columns
and
resume
its
sweep
from
the
north
one
which
gave
upon
the
office
the
overseer
cottage
the
various
buildings
devoted
to
the
business
ob
de
house
as
the
darkies
called
it
and
away
further
to
the
stables
carriage
house
granaries
and
other
buildings
of
the
estate
with
the
servants
cabins
behind
these
all
upon
the
north
side
of
woodbine
was
devoted
to
the
practical
utilitarian
needs
of
the
place
all
upon
its
southern
to
its
pleasures
and
luxuries
for
in
the
buildings
circling
away
from
the
south
end
were
the
spacious
kitchens
dairy
smoke
house
laundry
and
other
buildings
necessary
to
the
domestic
economy
of
the
household
none
of
these
buildings
touched
directly
upon
the
main
house
but
were
connected
with
it
by
a
colonnade
upon
which
the
woodbine
ran
riot
as
it
did
upon
all
the
detached
buildings
producing
an
effect
charming
beyond
description
the
colonnades
described
a
semicircle
from
the
and
corners
of
the
big
house
and
led
from
the
kitchen
to
the
big
dining
room
and
from
the
office
to
the
admiral
study
all
the
buildings
were
constructed
of
rich
red
brick
brought
from
england
generations
ago
the
pillars
being
of
white
marble
the
effect
against
the
dark
green
foliage
was
picturesque
to
agreed
unlike
many
of
the
old
southern
homes
woodbine
had
always
been
kept
in
perfect
repair
and
by
some
miracle
of
good
fortune
had
escaped
the
ravages
of
the
civil
war
its
present
owner
admiral
athol
seldon
enjoyed
a
very
comfortable
income
having
been
wise
enough
during
the
troublous
times
of
the
war
to
invest
his
fortune
where
it
would
be
reasonably
safe
he
would
not
have
been
called
a
wealthy
man
as
wealth
is
gauged
in
the
great
northern
cities
but
in
this
peaceful
valley
where
needs
were
simple
and
diversions
sensible
he
was
regarded
as
a
man
of
affluence
and
no
little
importance
during
the
war
he
had
served
in
the
confederate
navy
and
served
with
all
the
strength
of
his
convictions
when
it
ended
in
a
lost
cause
he
returned
to
woodbine
to
learn
in
what
condition
the
home
he
so
loved
had
come
through
the
conflict
for
it
was
situated
in
the
very
vortex
of
the
disturbance
finding
it
but
slightly
harmed
and
having
sufficient
means
to
repair
it
he
resolved
to
end
his
days
there
he
had
never
married
an
early
romance
having
come
to
a
tragic
end
in
the
death
of
his
fiancee
soon
after
the
outbreak
of
the
war
consequently
beautiful
woodbine
lacked
a
mistress
to
the
great
distress
of
the
old
family
servants
to
remedy
this
he
sent
for
his
brother
widow
and
her
little
daughter
mary
beverly
seldon
two
years
his
junior
had
been
killed
at
the
battle
of
winchester
in
and
the
little
mary
had
entered
this
world
exactly
five
months
after
her
death
her
mother
came
very
near
following
her
father
into
the
great
beyond
but
survived
the
shock
to
live
beneath
athol
seldon
hospitable
roof
until
mary
was
eleven
years
of
age
then
quietly
went
to
sleep
leaving
mary
to
her
uncle
care
the
child
then
and
there
became
mistress
not
only
of
woodbine
but
of
every
living
thing
upon
the
place
her
uncle
included
and
no
only
daughter
could
have
been
cared
for
petted
spoiled
or
spanked
more
systematically
than
the
madcap
mary
seldon
at
she
married
turner
ashby
the
grandson
of
one
of
the
admiral
oldest
friends
two
years
later
a
little
daughter
was
born
but
died
before
she
was
a
year
old
then
just
when
the
old
admiral
was
beginning
to
grumble
because
there
seemed
to
be
no
prospect
of
a
to
inherit
woodbine
mary
ashby
presented
him
with
not
only
an
heir
but
an
heiress
as
well
and
the
old
gentleman
came
very
near
a
balloon
ascension
the
twins
were
christened
athol
seldon
ashby
and
beverly
turner
ashby
before
they
had
fully
decided
that
they
were
really
american
citizens
and
for
seven
years
no
happier
household
could
have
been
found
in
the
state
then
another
calamity
visited
it
turner
ashby
was
killed
in
a
railway
accident
while
north
on
a
business
trip
it
was
a
frightful
blow
to
the
home
in
which
he
was
adored
by
every
member
from
the
admiral
straight
down
to
the
blackest
little
piccaninny
upon
the
estate
and
to
make
it
if
possible
more
tragic
all
that
ever
came
back
to
woodbine
was
the
seal
ring
he
had
worn
picked
up
in
the
charred
ruins
of
the
parlor
coach
more
than
eight
years
had
passed
since
that
tragedy
and
those
years
had
changed
mary
ashby
from
a
happy
young
wife
and
joyous
mother
to
a
quiet
dignified
woman
never
again
did
her
children
find
in
her
the
romping
they
had
always
known
though
she
never
ceased
to
be
the
gentle
tender
mother
and
how
they
missed
it
they
were
too
young
to
fully
appreciate
their
loss
though
they
grieved
deeply
for
the
tall
handsome
father
who
had
been
their
jolly
comrade
riding
romping
with
them
rowing
playing
all
manner
of
games
and
always
ready
to
relate
some
thrilling
tale
and
who
after
eleven
years
of
married
life
had
remained
as
much
their
mother
lover
as
upon
the
day
he
married
her
indeed
all
the
countryside
mourned
for
turner
ashby
for
such
a
personality
could
not
be
snatched
from
its
environment
without
leaving
a
terrible
blank
for
many
years
athol
was
like
him
in
character
but
not
the
least
in
personal
appearance
for
both
children
were
seldon
from
the
crowns
of
their
dark
heads
to
the
tips
of
their
small
feet
their
chum
and
inseparable
companion
archie
carey
might
more
readily
have
been
taken
for
turner
ashby
son
he
was
so
tall
and
two
years
their
senior
and
living
upon
the
adjacent
estate
of
uplands
he
had
grown
up
in
an
uninterrupted
companionship
with
athol
and
beverly
and
was
regarded
by
them
very
much
as
an
elder
brother
so
far
as
camaraderie
went
though
by
no
means
accorded
an
older
brother
privileges
by
miss
beverly
indeed
she
was
more
often
the
leading
spirit
in
the
fun
frolics
or
scrapes
into
which
they
were
constantly
plunging
as
for
example
the
one
alluded
to
in
the
opening
chapter
but
that
must
have
a
chapter
all
to
itself
chapter
iii
from
the
dormer
window
woodbine
as
has
been
said
lay
about
two
miles
from
four
corners
the
road
leading
to
the
post
office
clearly
visible
for
almost
its
entire
length
it
had
always
been
the
custom
at
woodbine
and
uplands
to
send
to
four
corners
twice
daily
for
the
mail
the
children
as
a
rule
doing
the
errand
and
only
too
glad
of
the
diversion
for
they
never
failed
to
hear
some
bit
of
neighborhood
gossip
at
the
post
office
or
meet
friends
from
some
of
the
adjacent
estates
moreover
there
was
invariably
the
speculation
regarding
the
writers
of
the
letters
taken
from
the
box
even
when
the
letters
were
addressed
to
other
members
of
their
respective
families
for
neither
beverly
athol
or
archie
had
extensive
correspondence
with
the
world
beyond
the
mountains
just
now
however
a
new
and
vital
interest
had
arisen
for
after
a
grave
family
conclave
it
had
been
definitely
settled
that
the
time
had
arrived
when
beverly
and
athol
must
break
away
from
the
old
order
of
things
and
be
sent
to
boarding
schools
up
to
the
present
time
a
governess
or
a
tutor
had
taught
their
young
ideas
to
shoot
straight
or
otherwise
with
admiral
seldon
as
head
of
the
discipline
department
a
position
by
no
means
a
sinecure
since
beverly
represented
the
need
of
such
a
department
until
the
children
were
twelve
the
governess
had
been
all
sufficient
but
at
that
point
athol
rebelled
at
being
a
sissy
and
demanded
a
tutor
beverly
entirely
concurring
in
his
views
so
a
tutor
had
been
installed
and
had
remained
until
the
previous
july
when
he
was
called
to
fill
a
more
lucrative
position
elsewhere
thus
woodbine
young
shoots
were
left
without
a
trainer
to
the
dismay
of
its
older
members
and
distress
of
its
younger
ones
for
both
beverly
and
athol
had
grown
very
fond
of
norman
lee
who
seemed
but
little
older
than
themselves
though
in
reality
quite
ten
years
their
senior
in
the
schoolroom
he
had
been
the
staid
dignified
instructor
but
beyond
its
walls
no
better
chum
and
comrade
could
have
been
found
he
was
in
all
their
good
times
and
frolics
consequently
his
resignation
just
broke
up
the
whole
outfit
as
athol
put
it
and
both
children
vowed
they
would
have
anybody
else
at
woodbine
because
nobody
else
could
ever
be
half
so
nice
as
norman
lee
long
before
the
three
years
of
his
tutorship
ended
he
had
become
norman
to
all
the
household
even
the
children
adopting
the
more
familiar
appellation
beyond
the
schoolroom
doors
though
within
it
the
concession
of
norman
was
yielded
which
secretly
amused
the
young
tutor
not
a
little
and
often
caused
him
to
wonder
how
the
boy
and
girl
contrived
to
maintain
the
attitude
so
consistently
and
with
such
perfect
gravity
for
four
hours
of
the
day
he
might
have
been
methuselah
own
brother
from
their
standpoint
but
upon
the
threshold
they
dropped
as
garments
the
relations
of
pupils
and
teacher
and
became
the
best
of
good
chums
it
had
been
a
singularly
happy
relation
and
it
was
not
surprising
that
it
seemed
to
them
impossible
to
renew
it
with
an
entire
stranger
and
truth
to
tell
the
admiral
and
ashby
were
not
in
the
least
sanguine
of
being
able
to
find
any
one
else
capable
of
repeating
it
and
for
a
time
were
a
good
deal
daunted
by
the
outlook
for
the
coming
year
the
previous
year
archie
carey
had
gone
away
to
school
and
during
his
holidays
had
come
back
to
uplands
brimful
of
enthusiasm
and
determined
to
have
athol
join
him
athol
was
quite
as
eager
to
do
so
the
one
fly
in
his
ointment
of
pure
joy
being
the
thought
of
the
separation
from
beverly
though
he
kept
this
fact
deep
buried
in
his
heart
nevertheless
it
made
him
feel
queer
when
the
possibility
of
going
upon
divided
ways
to
different
schools
became
a
very
definite
one
indeed
the
boy
and
girl
were
like
a
pair
of
horses
which
has
been
driven
together
fifteen
years
and
suddenly
separated
true
the
separation
was
not
as
yet
a
fact
but
human
beings
can
suffer
more
in
anticipation
than
the
brute
creation
can
in
reality
the
great
question
at
present
was
which
of
many
schools
to
select
admiral
seldon
had
written
to
several
for
circulars
and
information
and
had
been
nearly
swamped
with
replies
in
every
conceivable
form
at
length
he
had
weeded
the
mass
down
to
three
entering
into
more
definite
correspondence
with
these
and
the
replies
to
his
last
letters
were
now
being
eagerly
awaited
by
beverly
athol
and
archie
the
school
now
under
most
favorable
consideration
for
beverly
was
about
miles
from
sprucy
branch
the
town
nearest
four
corners
and
woodbine
it
was
the
coming
of
these
letters
which
had
caused
the
excitement
at
woodbine
as
the
boys
and
girl
were
about
to
go
for
the
morning
mail
athol
upon
his
little
thoroughbred
royal
archie
mounted
upon
his
own
handsome
hunter
snowdrift
and
beverly
on
a
wiry
little
broncho
which
had
been
sent
to
her
by
an
old
friend
of
the
admiral
who
had
become
the
owner
of
a
ranche
in
arizona
the
friend
had
assured
admiral
seldon
that
apache
had
been
thoroughly
gentled
and
beverly
who
had
never
known
the
meaning
of
fear
from
the
hour
she
could
bestride
a
horse
had
welcomed
him
with
delight
whether
the
old
admiral
had
done
likewise
is
open
to
doubt
but
ashby
frankly
protested
as
a
girl
had
ridden
every
ridable
thing
upon
the
place
but
it
was
literally
a
horse
of
another
color
when
it
came
to
the
point
of
beverly
doing
as
she
had
done
so
apache
had
been
tolerated
not
welcomed
by
ashby
and
having
been
an
to
some
of
the
little
beast
astonishing
performances
when
he
first
came
two
years
before
she
has
exacted
from
beverly
a
promise
to
be
very
cautious
when
riding
him
until
his
arrival
beverly
had
ridden
jewel
her
pony
and
been
quite
content
but
jewel
luster
was
dimmed
by
apache
brilliant
shines
as
old
uncle
abel
called
his
cavortings
when
feeling
exceptionally
fit
from
his
unaccustomed
diet
of
oats
and
feed
out
in
arizona
his
food
had
consisted
of
alfalfa
grass
with
an
occasional
feed
thrown
in
so
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
new
order
of
high
living
somewhat
intoxicated
him
but
apache
had
won
his
place
at
woodbine
as
the
young
people
were
about
to
set
forth
upon
their
trip
for
the
mail
ashby
warned
now
beverly
be
careful
dear
apache
has
a
lively
tickle
in
his
toes
this
crisp
morning
and
besides
the
roads
are
terribly
muddy
and
slippery
from
last
night
shower
i
be
careful
mumsey
dear
answered
the
girl
as
she
ran
down
the
steps
to
spring
upon
her
mount
careful
and
racing
with
the
boys
remember
ashby
called
after
her
perhaps
beverly
did
not
hear
the
concluding
admonition
at
any
rate
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
for
at
that
moment
apache
gave
testimony
of
the
tickle
in
his
toes
by
springing
straight
up
into
the
air
in
as
good
an
imitation
of
a
buck
as
any
thoroughly
gentled
little
broncho
could
give
in
the
polite
society
of
his
aristocratic
virginia
cousins
ashby
gave
a
startled
exclamation
but
beverly
secure
in
her
seat
waved
a
merry
and
was
off
after
the
boys
who
were
calling
to
her
to
hurry
up
of
course
they
had
not
heard
one
word
of
the
foregoing
conversation
had
they
done
so
it
is
safe
to
say
that
they
would
never
had
proposed
the
race
to
the
post
office
nor
tormented
beverly
for
being
no
sort
of
a
sport
and
scared
to
back
her
painted
plug
against
their
thoroughbreds
they
were
honorable
lads
and
would
have
felt
to
respect
ashby
wishes
but
not
having
heard
they
gave
beverly
all
that
was
coming
to
her
for
riding
a
calico
nag
though
said
nag
was
certainly
a
little
beauty
nearly
a
quarter
of
the
distance
to
four
corners
had
been
ridden
when
beverly
temper
never
too
elastic
snapped
her
riding
crop
descended
with
a
thwack
first
upon
royal
round
flank
then
upon
snowdrift
and
finally
upon
apache
side
as
she
cried
hush
up
and
i
beat
you
to
four
corners
or
die
in
the
attempt
the
sudden
onslaught
brought
the
result
to
be
expected
the
two
thoroughbreds
plunged
forward
with
snorts
of
indignant
protest
answered
by
apache
very
plebian
squeal
of
rage
as
he
shook
his
bony
little
head
and
struck
into
a
gait
such
as
beverly
had
never
dreamed
a
horse
could
strike
it
was
like
a
tornado
let
loose
and
expert
little
horsewoman
that
she
was
she
found
ample
occupation
for
all
her
wits
and
equestrian
skill
though
she
managed
to
jerk
out
as
she
whirled
past
her
companions
two
pounds
of
huyler
candy
if
i
beat
those
giraffes
of
yours
hence
the
commotion
at
four
corners
a
few
moments
later
the
whirlwind
arrived
and
the
conversation
recorded
in
the
first
chapter
telford
have
you
got
any
huyler
boxes
asked
the
winner
of
the
race
resting
her
gauntleted
hands
and
her
riding
crop
upon
the
counter
these
boys
are
trying
to
make
me
take
two
pounds
of
cinnamon
suckers
on
a
bet
did
you
ever
hear
such
nonsense

could
eat

i
reckon
answered
the
shop
keeper
drawing
two
or
three
boxes
from
his
case
and
placing
them
upon
his
counter
from
the
appearance
of
the
wrappings
they
belied
advertisement
of
being
fresh
every
hour
though
one
of
the
boxes
bore
that
firm
name
the
others
were
stamped
by
martha
washington
lowney
and
one
or
two
other
widely
known
manufacturers
yes
this
one
huyler
but
i
got
to
have
this
time
yes
i
have
too
athol
got
to
put
up
for
one
and
you
for
the
other
why
just
look
at
me
the
mud
on
me
ought
to
just
naturally
make
you
both
to
do
something
to
pay
up
for
making
me
get
into
such
a
state
we
did
make
you
you
started
the
circus
protested
her
brother
blessed
if
i
do
a
thing
for
you
if
it
was
likely
to
be
the
last
race
we
have
in
one
while
look
at
interjected
archie
carey
coming
over
from
the
letter
window
where
he
had
gone
to
ask
for
the
mail
and
slamming
upon
the
counter
beside
the
boxes
of
candy
half
a
dozen
plump
letters
three
bore
the
addresses
of
the
schools
under
consideration
all
three
faces
grew
sober
i
bet
those
will
settle
your
hash
bev
was
athol
comment
ah
why
could
you
have
been
a
boy
instead
of
a
girl
anyhow
protested
archie
then
you
have
come
along
with
us
as
a
matter
of
course
and
our
good
times
would
have
all
been
knocked
into
a
cocked
hat
come
on
let
go
home
said
beverly
soberly
as
she
gathered
up
her
boxes
nodded
to
telford
and
took
her
self
from
the
store
the
boys
lingering
to
pay
the
bill
she
had
remounted
apache
when
they
joined
her
archie
carrying
the
letters
which
he
stuffed
viciously
into
the
strapped
to
his
saddle
then
the
two
boys
sprang
upon
their
waiting
horses
as
they
rode
in
silence
beverly
glanced
down
at
her
khaki
riding
skirt
and
at
body
and
the
next
moment
had
stopped
short
exclaiming
look
at
us
and
i
promised
mother
i
would
race
you
did
exclaimed
the
boys
in
duet
i
sure
did
she
repeated
with
a
solemn
nod
this
was
too
much
for
her
companions
and
the
woodland
bordering
the
road
echoed
to
their
shouts
when
they
had
regained
some
athol
asked
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
do
i
going
to
stop
at
the
branch
and
scrub
some
of
this
mud
off
apache
and
myself
for
if
we
show
up
like
this
mother
will
think
been
acting
ten
times
worse
that
i
really
have
though
goodness
knows
it
bad
enough
as
it
is
i
did
mean
to
break
my
promise
but
i
could
let
you
boys
put
it
all
over
me
like
you
did
and
not
get
back
at
you
now
get
out
of
the
way
while
i
clean
up
and
maybe
you
could
do
a
little
on
your
own
accounts
and
not
suffer
for
it
either
he
looks
exactly
like
one
after
a
spring
thaw
the
boys
glanced
at
the
beautiful
white
horse
and
then
at
each
other
the
ensuing
fifteen
minutes
were
spent
in
the
vigorous
grooming
of
their
steeds
beverly
scrubbing
apache
as
energetically
as
archie
and
athol
did
royal
and
snowdrift
flat
sticks
served
as
scrapers
and
bunches
of
dry
grass
for
cloths
when
the
animals
looked
a
little
less
like
animated
mud
pies
beverly
turned
her
attention
to
her
riding
skirt
to
restore
that
to
its
pristine
freshness
might
have
daunted
a
professional
scourer
the
more
she
rubbed
and
scrubbed
the
worse
the
result
and
finally
when
she
was
a
sight
from
alternate
streaks
of
mud
and
wet
splotches
she
sprang
upon
the
startled
apache
crying
come
along
home
quick
if
i
got
to
face
the
music
the
quicker
done
the
better
and
was
off
down
the
road
in
a
fair
way
to
being
as
muddy
when
she
reached
woodbine
as
she
was
when
she
began
her
cleansing
processes
at
the
branch
while
up
in
one
of
the
dormer
windows
of
the
big
house
her
mother
stood
smiling
to
herself
it
was
one
of
the
rare
occasions
when
she
had
occasion
to
go
to
that
room
for
some
stored
away
winter
clothing
against
beverly
pending
departure
for
boarding
school
as
the
riders
resumed
their
homeward
journey
she
smiled
and
said
softly
how
exactly
like
beverly
now
will
come
confession
and
repentance
and
shall
i
be
able
to
keep
a
sober
face
chapter
iv
divided
ways
yes
i
just
forgot
all
about
it
for
of
course
i
was
going
to
let
the
boys
run
me
to
death
and
oh
mother
apache
can
get
over
the
ground
i
never
saw
anything
like
the
way
he
ran
no
neither
have
replied
ashby
significantly
you
asked
beverly
in
surprise
ashby
nodded
though
her
lips
twitched
beverly
face
clouded
and
her
lips
set
how
did
you
see
me
she
demanded
from
the
window
of
the
dormer
chamber
the
girl
dark
eyes
grew
darker
and
signs
of
a
pending
tempest
lowered
as
she
asked
mother
did
you
go
up
there
to
spy
upon
me
you
almost
go
into
that
room
did
you
believe
me
did
you
think
i
had
to
be
watched
i
think
that
was
horrid
horrid
of
you
you
know
i
did
mean
to
break
my
word
i
just
forgot
when
the
boys
teased
me
about
my
calico
plug
and
would
have
stood
for
that
if
you
been
in
my
place
you
just
know
you
would
you
used
to
do
crazier
things
when
you
were
a
girl
for
uncle
athol
has
told
me
just
dozens
and
dozens
of
them
why
did
you
spy
upon
me
why
why
i
loathe
being
distrusted
the
storm
had
burst
with
a
vengeance
beverly
hush
and
listen
to
me
if
you
will
pause
a
moment
you
will
know
perfectly
well
that
i
had
no
idea
of
upon
you
have
i
ever
done
so
you
know
better
it
seems
to
me
you
are
displaying
some
doubt
also
if
i
did
not
know
it
to
be
the
outcome
of
your
excitement
i
should
decline
to
make
any
explanation
as
it
is
i
tell
you
that
i
went
up
there
to
get
out
your
winter
things
in
order
to
have
them
remodeled
by
chance
i
looked
out
of
the
window
it
is
a
view
rather
worth
looking
upon
you
admit
and
well
i
saw
a
moving
picture
instead
of
the
usual
quiet
landscape
and
it
was
some
as
athol
would
say
ashby
smiled
involuntarily
as
she
recalled
the
spirited
action
of
that
moving
picture
yes
was
it
cried
beverly
eagerly
and
oh
that
little
apache
is
some
horse
mumsey
then
her
face
resumed
its
defiant
expression
and
she
continued
but
i
showed
them
that
they
could
put
it
all
over
me
and
not
pay
for
it
they
got
the
of
their
lives
and
got
two
pounds
of
candy
if
i
did
get
some
mud
into
the
bargain
i
have
come
home
to
tell
you
anyway
you
i
would
do
you
have
i
intimated
a
doubt
of
it
dear
the
tone
was
very
disarming
and
quick
tempered
little
beverly
succumbed
throwing
her
arms
about
her
mother
neck
she
buried
her
head
upon
her
shoulder
as
she
sobbed
oh
do
forgive
me
i
was
the
horrid
one
for
doubting
you
and
saying
such
nasty
things
please
give
me
bally
hack
and
send
me
away
to
school
quick
then
maybe
i
learn
to
think
twice
before
i
sass
once
as
mammy
riah
says
i
reckon
what
i
need
is
a
good
strict
schoolmarm
to
boss
me
i
hope
the
element
will
be
absent
from
the
school
we
shall
choose
i
doubt
it
would
work
very
well
with
you
beverly
sparks
and
gunpowder
are
apt
to
lead
to
pretty
serious
explosions
and
i
dislike
pyrotechnics
which
are
likely
to
spread
disaster
now
go
change
your
clothes
and
make
yourself
presentable
for
i
hear
uncle
athol
calling
and
i
dare
say
the
momentous
question
is
about
to
be
answered
but
what
am
i
going
to
do
without
my
little
whirlwind
to
keep
things
stirring
ended
ashby
tenderly
drawing
the
penitent
into
her
arms
and
oh
mumsey
mumsey
where
shall
i
ever
find
any
one
who
will
be
as
patient
with
the
whirlwind
i
suspect
i
going
to
be
desperately
homesick
more
days
than
once
but
i
truly
truly
try
not
to
disgrace
you
and
woodbine
yes
we
coming
uncle
athol
as
the
stentorian
tones
came
booming
up
the
broad
stairway
mary
beverly
come
along
quick
and
hear
these
letters
lord
save
us
rather
run
a
blockade
than
choose
a
school
for
a
couple
of
youngsters
i
be
gray
dead
and
buried
before
it
done
come
down
i
say
we
are
coming
uncle
called
ashby
laughing
softly
as
she
pictured
the
old
admiral
striding
up
and
down
the
wide
hall
anathematizing
all
the
schools
in
creation
and
launching
side
shots
at
the
boys
because
they
were
laughing
at
him
his
roar
was
far
worse
than
his
attack
as
the
lads
well
knew
as
sitting
no
sprawling
upon
the
big
sofa
they
did
not
hesitate
to
let
fly
a
projectile
or
two
in
return
only
to
howl
at
the
result
for
well
both
knew
his
weakness
for
his
grandniece
she
could
wind
him
around
her
little
finger
they
said
a
moment
later
ashby
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
landing
to
be
greeted
by
come
and
hear
these
letters
where
beverly
she
will
be
down
as
soon
as
she
changes
her
riding
skirt
the
boys
snickered
turning
upon
them
the
admiral
demanded
what
are
you
young
scamps
chortling
about
bev
answered
his
nephew
did
you
see
her
when
she
came
in
now
what
was
the
matter
with
her
she
usually
all
right
oh
nothing
just
a
trifle
muddy
mother
can
describe
her
appearance
better
than
we
can
i
reckon
laughed
athol
jr
the
admiral
bent
his
keen
eyes
upon
the
boys
he
was
a
handsome
old
gentleman
and
wonderfully
for
his
years
and
i
lay
a
wager
you
fellows
started
the
ball
rolling
and
beverly
had
to
brace
up
and
stop
it
he
nodded
we
did
honest
uncle
athol
we
did
did
we
arch
ask
bev
here
she
comes
laughed
archie
pointing
toward
the
stairs
down
which
a
demure
spick
and
span
young
lady
was
making
her
way
with
all
the
propriety
of
a
young
instantly
athol
had
sprung
to
his
feet
and
was
mincing
along
behind
the
admiral
in
such
perfect
mimicry
of
his
sister
that
archie
hooted
beverly
scorned
to
notice
the
and
asked
do
you
want
me
uncle
athol
yes
come
along
into
my
study
for
this
well
perplexing
question
is
going
to
be
settled
right
here
and
now
realizing
that
the
settling
meant
a
separation
for
a
shorter
or
longer
time
and
for
a
greater
or
less
distance
however
determined
the
boys
sobered
down
and
followed
the
others
into
the
study
there
is
no
use
going
into
details
the
letters
were
duly
read
and
discussed
and
it
was
decided
that
early
the
next
morning
admiral
seldon
and
ashby
should
visit
two
of
the
schools
those
nearest
sprucy
branch
being
selected
and
please
uncle
athol
choose
leslie
manor
it
so
near
kilton
hall
that
the
boys
can
ride
over
to
see
me
and
i
can
go
to
see
them
begged
beverly
clasping
her
hands
about
her
arm
and
looking
up
into
his
face
in
a
manner
to
coax
the
birds
off
the
bushes
he
drew
her
into
his
circling
arm
and
turning
her
face
up
to
his
asked
as
he
kissed
the
soft
lips
and
how
in
kingdom
come
do
you
suppose
going
to
get
on
without
your
coming
to
see
me
often
you
torment
of
my
soul
and
how
do
you
expect
the
boys
to
cover
those
ten
miles
between
leslie
manor
and
kilton
hall
much
less
you
and
a
pretty
it
would
make
if
you
were
to
go
to
their
school
would
it
you
huzzy
why
i
athol
sister
and
almost
archie
too
why
could
i
go
we
have
our
horses
of
course
lord
bless
my
soul
are
you
counting
on
moving
the
whole
of
woodbine
up
yonder
asked
the
admiral
in
dismay
why
no
uncle
athol
but
of
course
we
must
take
snowdrift
royal
and
apache
answered
beverly
as
a
matter
of
course
whereupon
archie
and
athol
standing
just
behind
the
admiral
and
beverly
fell
upon
each
other
necks
such
an
idea
as
taking
their
horses
with
them
had
never
for
a
moment
entered
the
boy
heads
well
we
see
we
see
temporized
the
old
gentleman
no
seeming
to
have
been
left
out
of
the
vocabulary
he
employed
in
speaking
to
beverly
an
hour
was
spent
in
discussing
the
subject
pro
and
con
and
at
its
end
admiral
seldon
cried
quit
running
on
dead
reckoning
and
tell
mammy
riah
to
pack
our
grips
for
your
mother
and
i
are
off
on
the
from
sprucy
branch
and
that
means
stepping
lively
tomorrow
morning
mary
and
i
want
uncle
abel
to
understand
that
the
carriage
is
to
be
at
the
door
at
and
so
the
die
was
cast
at
the
following
morning
the
carriage
accompanied
by
the
three
most
interested
in
what
the
verdict
would
be
upon
its
return
sped
down
the
broad
driveway
the
leaves
which
had
fallen
during
the
night
crinkling
beneath
the
wheels
the
carriage
horses
cutting
all
sorts
of
antics
in
sympathy
with
their
saddle
companions
cavorting
beside
them
for
the
young
people
were
acting
as
body
guard
it
was
not
at
all
likely
that
the
older
people
would
return
that
night
for
train
service
was
limited
so
all
preparations
were
made
for
an
overnight
trip
bidding
them
at
the
railway
station
beverly
athol
and
archie
rode
back
to
woodbine
in
no
mood
for
one
of
their
wild
stampedes
the
real
parting
was
too
close
at
hand
that
day
and
evening
seemed
the
longest
to
beverly
that
she
had
ever
known
archie
was
to
spend
the
night
at
woodbine
and
aunt
caroline
mammy
riah
and
earl
queen
the
butler
did
their
best
to
make
up
for
the
absence
of
the
heads
of
the
house
but
it
surely
was
a
sober
little
group
which
sat
down
at
the
brightly
polished
mahogany
dining
table
beverly
in
her
mother
seat
athol
in
his
uncle
and
archie
as
guest
aunt
caroline
had
sent
up
her
daintiest
preserves
and
had
prepared
a
supper
fitten
for
a
queen
she
averred
her
fried
chicken
would
have
put
delmonico
to
shame
and
her
hot
waffles
were
lak
ter
fly
up
offen
de
dish
i
serve
on
was
queen
affirmation
as
he
took
them
from
her
but
nothing
was
eaten
with
its
usual
relish
at
ten
the
next
morning
came
a
long
distance
phone
call
from
admiral
seldon
beverly
reached
the
phone
first
and
it
all
settled
which
one
leslie
manor
good
and
ath
going
to
kilton
hall
oh
splendid
you
be
down
on
the
three
train
meet
you
of
course
yes
i
tell
the
boys
mother
sends
love
give
her
ours
and
tell
her
we
are
all
right
and
have
been
as
good
as
gold
and
the
phone
was
hung
up
with
a
snap
as
beverly
spun
round
and
catching
the
one
nearest
at
hand
who
happened
to
be
archie
turkey
trotted
him
the
length
of
the
big
hall
before
she
end
their
curiosity
and
thus
came
the
selection
of
the
two
schools
athol
with
archie
at
kilton
hall
and
beverly
at
leslie
manor
ten
miles
away
and
near
one
of
the
most
wonderful
and
beautiful
caprices
of
that
capricious
lady
dame
nature
that
human
eye
is
ever
likely
to
rest
upon
they
were
to
leave
woodbine
and
uplands
on
the
last
day
of
september
as
the
school
term
began
october
first
the
intervening
days
being
full
of
the
excitement
incident
to
their
departure
the
thirtieth
of
september
came
at
once
too
rapidly
and
too
slowly
and
dawned
crisp
and
clear
a
good
omen
for
the
start
were
said
to
the
servants
ashby
was
embraced
tempestuously
by
beverly
and
given
a
bear
hug
by
athol
archie
shook
hands
and
all
three
followed
admiral
seldon
in
to
the
waiting
carriage
to
wave
to
ashby
who
stood
upon
the
south
portico
and
to
all
the
servants
gathered
in
the
south
colonnade
then
ashby
the
silent
house
went
upstairs
to
deserted
room
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
her
bed
and
burying
her
head
in
the
tumbled
pillow
wept
like
a
girl
a
moment
later
mammy
riah
entered
the
room
caught
sight
of
the
weeper
grabbed
up
an
old
muddy
shoe
of
beverly
and
raining
tears
into
it
forthwith
raised
a
genuine
darkey
wail
of
woe
which
very
nearly
turned
ashby
tears
into
hysterics
chapter
v
leslie
manor
it
was
the
opening
day
at
leslie
manor
late
the
evening
before
the
last
girl
had
come
straggling
reluctantly
back
after
a
long
summer
vacation
this
morning
all
was
hustle
and
bustle
at
the
rear
of
the
building
the
last
trunks
were
being
bumped
down
from
the
express
wagon
which
had
brought
them
from
the
railway
station
and
under
the
direction
of
wesley
watts
mather
the
dusky
porter
janitor
and
general
handy
man
were
being
conveyed
to
the
various
rooms
in
which
they
and
their
owners
would
bide
for
the
ensuing
eight
months
for
leslie
manor
did
not
open
its
doors
to
its
pupils
until
october
first
and
closed
them
the
first
week
in
june
this
was
at
the
option
of
miss
woodhull
the
principal
who
went
abroad
each
june
taking
with
her
several
of
her
pupils
for
a
european
tour
to
return
with
her
enlightened
edified
charges
in
september
it
was
a
pleasurable
as
well
as
a
profitable
arrangement
for
the
lady
who
was
absolutely
free
of
encumbrance
and
could
do
as
she
chose
leslie
manor
had
once
been
the
home
of
a
widely
known
southern
family
whose
fortunes
had
sadly
decreased
during
the
war
and
completely
evaporated
after
it
for
several
years
the
place
was
entirely
deserted
and
neglected
then
miss
woodhull
recently
graduated
from
a
new
england
college
and
fairly
bristling
with
degrees
for
which
she
had
exchanged
the
freshness
sweetness
and
spontaneity
of
youth
and
health
was
ordered
to
spend
at
least
a
year
in
the
south
in
the
doubtful
hope
of
recovering
the
youth
and
health
just
where
to
find
these
valuable
assets
was
the
hardest
question
to
answer
her
only
relatives
were
an
elderly
maiden
aunt
and
an
irascible
old
uncle
whose
time
was
too
filled
with
providing
the
wherewithal
to
maintain
a
very
elaborate
establishment
for
a
very
vain
wife
and
three
frivolous
daughters
to
leave
any
left
over
in
which
to
think
of
the
welfare
of
his
only
sister
child
moreover
his
wife
and
daughters
could
not
endure
her
and
truth
to
tell
they
had
about
as
much
affinity
for
one
another
as
have
oil
and
water
they
might
flow
side
by
side
forever
but
never
mingle
the
maiden
aunt
was
her
father
sister
an
austere
dignified
old
party
who
resided
most
exclusively
in
her
ancestral
home
on
beacon
street
and
lived
in
a
rut
worn
deep
by
tradition
conviction
and
virginia
was
not
that
she
was
likely
to
be
supplanted
by
the
birth
of
some
one
having
greater
claim
to
her
aunt
fortune
her
possible
rivals
for
the
very
substantial
income
which
her
aunt
enjoyed
were
foundling
asylums
a
new
religious
cult
just
then
in
its
infancy
in
the
hub
of
the
universe
and
innumerable
movements
and
reforms
she
had
sent
virginia
through
college
provided
her
with
a
fair
allowance
bidden
her
make
something
of
herself
for
the
sake
of
her
name
and
then
washed
her
hands
of
all
responsibility
in
her
own
sight
she
had
fulfilled
all
her
duty
when
virginia
woodhull
left
college
after
attaining
degrees
galore
but
in
broken
health
and
with
years
checked
off
upon
her
life
calendar
she
seemed
to
have
run
plump
up
against
a
stone
wall
dozens
of
positions
were
almost
forced
upon
her
mentally
she
was
qualified
to
fill
any
of
them
physically
nor
could
she
remain
near
the
only
relatives
she
possessed
had
they
even
cared
two
straws
to
have
her
remain
while
in
this
depressing
state
of
mind
and
body
a
girl
whom
she
had
coached
in
the
college
graduated
and
was
about
to
return
to
her
home
in
virginia
she
was
several
years
virginia
junior
pretty
and
charming
and
possessed
the
power
of
looking
a
little
deeper
below
the
surface
than
the
average
human
being
possesses
she
invited
miss
woodhull
to
accompany
her
to
roanoke
and
fate
stepped
in
and
did
the
rest
the
month
was
spent
in
a
lovely
old
home
virginia
woodhull
gained
in
health
and
strength
and
recovered
something
in
the
way
of
nerve
control
and
mental
poise
when
the
month
ended
she
decided
to
do
the
state
whose
name
she
bore
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
year
in
going
from
one
point
to
another
in
it
until
she
knew
its
entire
topography
by
heart
in
the
course
of
her
journeyings
she
visited
the
luray
caverns
as
a
matter
of
course
and
enroute
came
upon
picturesque
deserted
decrepit
leslie
manor
and
fell
as
enthusiastically
in
love
with
it
as
it
was
given
to
her
repressed
nature
to
fall
in
love
moreover
for
a
long
time
she
had
been
obsessed
with
a
desire
to
bring
into
this
happy
contented
state
something
of
the
energy
progress
intellectual
activities
as
she
gauged
them
of
new
england
the
general
uplift
inspired
by
the
seat
of
learning
she
had
just
left
after
courses
unto
the
nth
degree
to
thoroughly
stir
things
up
and
make
these
comfortable
contented
virginians
sit
up
and
take
notice
of
their
shortcomings
she
was
given
a
work
in
life
though
quite
unsought
and
she
meant
to
undertake
it
exactly
as
she
has
undertaken
her
college
course
and
make
a
fine
job
of
it
fortunately
or
unfortunately
according
to
the
viewpoint
taken
the
aunt
in
boston
was
ceremoniously
tucked
away
in
the
tomb
of
her
ancestors
just
as
this
resolution
crystalized
and
virginia
woodhull
found
herself
in
possession
of
a
very
comfortable
income
though
said
income
had
a
string
attached
to
it
which
was
intended
to
yank
it
back
to
the
religious
cult
before
mentioned
in
the
event
of
virginia
or
death
either
way
considered
it
was
a
rather
dubious
heritage
but
it
served
to
purchase
leslie
manor
and
the
school
became
a
fait
accompli
this
was
in
the
early
eighties
and
from
its
opening
day
the
school
had
flourished
perhaps
this
was
due
to
new
england
energy
and
culture
or
possibly
some
credit
rested
with
bonnell
the
matron
and
real
head
of
the
house
a
sweet
lovable
gracious
southern
gentlewoman
whose
own
family
and
fortunes
had
vanished
when
she
was
a
tiny
child
but
who
had
grown
up
with
relatives
in
whose
home
love
ruled
supreme
and
in
which
the
little
veronica
dulany
had
blossomed
as
a
flower
at
forty
years
of
age
she
still
retained
a
genuine
love
and
understanding
of
her
in
spite
of
many
sorrows
and
the
death
when
she
was
still
a
mere
girl
of
husband
and
little
daughter
before
she
had
been
called
percy
bonnell
five
years
at
any
rate
for
ten
years
bonnell
had
ruled
supreme
at
leslie
manor
engaging
its
servants
as
she
saw
fit
directing
the
household
economizing
as
she
felt
wisest
feeding
hungry
girls
cuddling
the
homesick
ones
caring
for
the
ailing
ones
and
loved
by
every
creature
human
or
animal
upon
the
place
miss
woodhull
had
no
time
for
domestic
matters
and
all
the
sentiment
in
her
had
been
killed
in
her
early
childhood
and
curiously
enough
the
academic
force
at
leslie
manor
was
about
equally
divided
into
woodhull
and
bonnell
factions
miss
stetson
the
teacher
of
mathematics
was
in
keen
sympathy
with
miss
woodhull
as
was
miss
forsdyke
the
latin
teacher
and
miss
baylis
the
teacher
of
history
and
literature
but
miss
dalton
the
gymnasium
and
physical
culture
teacher
and
miss
powell
who
had
charge
of
the
little
girls
sided
with
bonnell
as
did
monsieur
santelle
and
old
herr
professor
stenzel
even
miss
juliet
atwell
who
came
twice
each
week
for
aesthetic
dancing
and
several
other
stunts
openly
worshiped
at
the
bonnell
shrine
herr
stenzel
admiration
had
more
than
once
proved
an
embarrassing
proposition
to
the
lady
for
herr
stenzel
loved
the
flesh
pots
of
leslie
manor
and
knew
right
well
who
presided
over
them
but
bonnell
was
equal
to
a
good
many
herr
stenzels
but
in
one
sense
we
have
wandered
a
long
way
from
beverly
ashby
and
opening
day
at
leslie
manor
though
all
these
people
vitally
concern
her
leslie
manor
stood
in
the
centre
of
a
wide
rolling
thickly
wooded
estate
encompassed
by
a
holly
hedge
noted
for
miles
around
for
its
beauty
and
its
prickly
barrier
to
freedom
the
house
had
been
restored
and
added
to
in
order
to
meet
the
demands
of
a
school
harboring
sixty
or
seventy
girls
though
it
still
retained
its
old
lines
of
beauty
and
its
air
of
hominess
miss
woodhull
first
concern
had
been
to
make
the
place
sanitary
the
last
word
spelled
with
italics
and
to
this
end
modern
improvements
and
conveniences
had
supplanted
the
old
expedients
of
domestic
economy
everything
in
leslie
manor
became
strictly
modern
and
the
upper
floors
were
arranged
in
the
most
approved
single
or
suites
for
the
teachers
and
the
seniors
the
lower
ones
were
accurately
divided
into
living
dining
and
reception
rooms
in
one
wing
were
the
model
recitation
rooms
and
miss
woodhull
office
in
another
the
undergraduate
rooms
nor
had
the
grounds
been
overlooked
they
were
very
trim
very
prim
very
perfectly
kept
and
made
one
realize
this
at
every
turn
it
also
made
one
wonder
how
the
old
owner
would
feel
could
he
return
from
his
nameless
grave
at
appomatox
and
be
obliged
to
pace
along
the
faultless
walks
where
formerly
he
had
romped
with
his
children
across
the
velvety
turf
but
he
and
his
were
dead
and
gone
and
the
spirit
of
new
england
primness
personified
in
virginia
woodhull
spinster
aged
now
dominated
the
place
it
was
lovely
to
look
upon
and
compelled
one
admiration
though
it
left
some
indefinable
longing
unsatisfied
it
was
so
orderly
it
almost
made
one
ache
perhaps
something
of
this
ache
unconsciously
obsessed
beverly
ashby
as
she
sat
upon
one
of
the
immaculate
garden
seats
placed
at
the
side
of
an
immaculate
gravel
walk
and
looked
through
a
vista
of
immaculately
trimmed
trees
at
the
dozens
of
girls
out
of
the
door
of
the
wing
in
which
most
of
the
undergraduate
rooms
were
situated
for
all
members
of
the
under
classes
were
housed
in
the
south
wing
the
seniors
rooming
in
the
more
luxurious
quarters
of
the
main
building
not
that
the
seniors
were
the
happier
for
their
exaltation
they
had
enjoyed
some
pretty
merry
hours
in
that
old
south
wing
but
with
the
advent
of
the
senior
year
were
forced
to
live
up
to
the
dignity
of
the
main
building
the
faculty
occupied
the
north
end
of
it
beverly
had
arrived
the
previous
afternoon
and
owing
to
the
fact
that
she
had
never
been
at
school
before
in
all
her
fifteen
years
nor
journeyed
very
far
afield
from
dear
old
woodbine
she
did
not
know
a
soul
at
leslie
manor
so
far
as
she
now
knew
the
parting
of
the
ways
when
athol
and
archie
bade
her
at
front
royal
and
accompanied
by
admiral
seldon
went
on
to
kilton
hall
gave
beverly
an
entirely
new
sensation
she
then
fully
realized
that
she
was
growing
up
and
that
the
old
days
of
boy
and
girl
frolicking
were
slipping
into
the
background
that
from
that
very
spot
where
the
roads
branched
she
must
begin
her
journey
toward
as
the
boys
must
begin
theirs
toward
manhood
and
the
thought
hurt
like
a
physical
pain
she
did
want
to
grow
up
and
leave
those
happy
days
behind
she
had
been
met
at
front
royal
by
one
of
the
teachers
who
was
returning
to
the
school
beverly
had
tried
to
talk
to
her
as
she
would
have
talked
with
any
one
at
home
but
miss
baylis
did
not
encourage
familiarity
upon
the
part
of
the
pupils
and
promptly
decided
that
beverly
was
one
of
those
irresponsible
impulsive
southern
girls
who
always
proved
such
trials
to
her
and
miss
woodhull
before
they
could
be
brought
to
understand
strict
conventions
consequently
she
had
met
spontaneous
manner
with
frigid
politeness
and
had
relieved
herself
of
the
young
girl
society
the
moment
the
school
was
reached
luckily
beverly
had
fallen
into
bonnell
hands
directly
she
reached
leslie
manor
so
some
of
the
ice
coating
in
which
she
had
made
the
drive
from
the
railway
station
had
been
thawed
by
that
lovable
lady
but
she
had
passed
a
desperately
lonely
evening
in
her
room
unpacking
and
getting
settled
and
had
gone
to
bed
in
a
frame
of
mind
rarely
experienced
by
beverly
ashby
her
like
many
other
tardy
ones
would
not
arrive
until
the
next
day
and
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
place
spelled
desolation
for
beverly
her
first
waterloo
had
been
encountered
early
that
morning
when
feeling
lonelier
than
she
ever
had
felt
in
all
her
life
she
dressed
early
and
ran
out
to
the
stable
to
visit
apache
he
seemed
as
lonely
and
forlorn
as
his
little
mistress
and
thinking
to
cheer
him
as
well
as
herself
she
had
led
him
forth
by
his
halter
and
together
they
had
enjoyed
one
grand
prance
down
the
driveway
unluckily
miss
baylis
had
seen
this
harmless
little
performance
and
not
being
able
to
appreciate
perfect
human
and
equine
grace
had
been
promptly
scandalized
it
was
at
once
reported
to
miss
woodhull
and
beverly
was
informed
that
such
hoydenish
actions
should
be
relegated
to
the
uncultured
herd
beverly
did
not
ask
whether
she
must
number
herself
among
that
herd
but
the
fact
had
been
implied
nevertheless
and
she
smarted
under
what
she
felt
to
be
an
unmerited
and
unduly
severe
rebuke
if
not
an
open
insult
she
was
still
smarting
as
she
sat
hidden
in
her
nook
and
sorely
in
need
of
an
antidote
for
the
smart
presently
it
came
in
the
homeopathic
form
of
like
curing
like
chapter
vi
new
friends
naturally
no
real
work
was
done
on
opening
day
miss
woodhull
stately
and
austere
sat
in
her
office
directing
her
staff
with
the
air
of
an
empress
one
of
the
old
girls
declared
that
all
she
lacked
was
a
crown
and
sceptre
and
the
new
ones
who
entered
that
office
to
be
registered
tagged
the
above
mentioned
girl
called
it
came
out
of
it
feeling
at
least
three
inches
shorter
than
when
they
entered
during
her
reign
in
leslie
manor
miss
woodhull
had
grown
much
stouter
and
one
seeing
her
upon
this
opening
day
would
scarcely
have
recognized
in
her
the
slender
woman
who
had
opened
its
doors
to
the
budding
girlhood
of
the
land
nearly
thirty
years
before
she
was
now
a
stately
woman
who
carried
herself
with
an
air
of
owning
the
state
of
her
adoption
and
looked
comparatively
younger
in
her
year
than
she
had
in
her
as
beverly
sat
in
her
nook
watching
the
little
girls
of
the
primary
grades
run
out
to
their
playground
at
the
rear
of
the
building
the
old
girls
of
the
upper
classes
pair
off
and
stroll
away
through
the
extensive
grounds
and
the
new
ones
drift
thither
and
yonder
like
rudderless
craft
she
saw
two
girls
come
from
miss
woodhull
office
one
was
a
trifle
shorter
than
beverly
and
plump
as
a
woodcock
she
was
not
pretty
but
piquant
with
a
pair
of
hazel
eyes
that
crinkled
at
the
corners
a
saucy
pug
nose
a
mouth
like
a
cupid
bow
and
a
mop
of
the
curliest
hair
beverly
had
ever
seen
her
companion
was
tall
slight
graceful
distinguished
a
little
aristocrat
from
the
top
of
her
raven
black
hair
to
the
tips
of
her
daintily
shod
feet
was
aileen
norman
and
though
only
sixteen
she
was
the
one
girl
in
the
school
who
could
hold
miss
woodhull
within
the
limits
of
absolute
courtesy
under
circumstances
although
descended
from
new
england
finest
stock
miss
woodhull
also
possessed
her
full
share
of
the
new
englander
nervous
irritability
which
all
the
good
breeding
and
discipline
ever
brought
to
bear
can
never
wholly
eradicate
her
sarcasm
and
irony
had
caused
more
than
one
cheeks
to
grow
crimson
and
her
blood
to
boil
under
their
stinging
injustice
for
miss
woodhull
did
not
invariably
get
to
the
root
of
things
she
was
a
trifle
superior
to
minor
details
but
aileen
possessed
an
armor
to
combat
just
such
a
temperament
and
her
companion
sally
conant
wits
were
sharp
enough
to
get
out
of
most
of
the
scrapes
into
which
she
led
her
friend
so
the
pair
were
a
very
fair
foil
to
each
other
and
a
match
for
miss
woodhull
what
their
ability
would
prove
augmented
by
beverly
characteristics
we
will
learn
later
as
they
came
down
the
steps
from
miss
woodhull
office
said
office
being
in
the
wing
in
which
the
recitation
rooms
were
situated
and
quite
separate
from
the
main
building
sally
eyes
were
snapping
and
her
head
wagging
ominously
aileen
cheeks
were
even
a
deeper
tint
than
they
ordinarily
were
and
her
head
was
held
a
little
higher
evidently
something
of
a
disturbing
nature
had
taken
place
they
did
not
see
beverly
in
her
bosky
nook
and
she
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
reveal
herself
to
them
it
was
all
very
well
to
stick
of
us
together
when
we
were
freshmen
and
sophomores
but
juniors
deserve
consideration
i
think
if
peggy
westfield
had
come
back
this
year
it
would
have
been
all
well
and
good
but
to
put
a
perfect
stranger
in
that
room
is
a
pure
and
simple
outrage
why
we
have
even
an
idea
what
she
like
or
whether
she
be
congenial
or
nice
or
or
anything
why
could
she
have
given
us
one
of
the
girls
we
know
stormed
sally
because
she
likes
to
prove
that
she
is
great
and
we
are
small
i
dare
say
answered
aileen
of
course
the
new
girl
may
be
perfectly
lovely
and
maybe
we
get
to
like
her
a
lot
but
it
the
of
the
thing
which
enrages
me
it
seems
to
me
we
might
have
some
voice
in
the
choice
of
a
after
being
in
the
school
three
years
there
are
a
dozen
in
our
class
from
which
we
could
choose
the
third
girl
if
we
got
to
have
her
though
i
do
see
why
just
you
and
i
could
have
a
suite
to
ourselves
mercy
knows
there
are
enough
rooms
in
our
wing
and
next
year
we
have
to
be
in
the
main
house
anyway
and
i
just
loathe
the
thought
of
it
too
ugh
so
do
i
but
let
reconnoiter
and
try
to
spot
our
bugbear
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
appropriate
to
call
her
by
another
name
got
to
share
our
with
her
even
if
we
have
got
to
share
our
bed
why
did
the
empress
tell
us
her
name
the
stubborn
old
thing
just
girl
from
sprucy
branch
will
share
your
suite
this
year
she
arrived
last
evening
and
has
already
arranged
her
things
in
a
of
suite
a
of
course
the
very
nicest
of
the
three
bedrooms
opening
out
of
that
study
and
the
only
one
which
has
sunshine
all
day
long
you
or
i
should
have
had
it
i
do
call
it
fair
she
probably
trying
to
make
a
good
impression
upon
miss
sprucy
branch
the
name
sounds
sort
of
japanesy
does
it
wonder
if
she
looks
like
a
jap
too
well
if
you
are
speaking
of
me
i
can
tell
you
right
now
that
miss
woodhull
has
succeeded
in
making
any
pleasing
an
impression
upon
miss
sprucy
branch
and
so
far
as
keeping
room
a
in
suite
is
concerned
either
of
you
is
welcome
to
it
because
it
would
take
just
mighty
little
to
make
me
beat
it
for
the
stables
mount
apache
habit
or
no
habit
and
do
those
miles
between
this
place
and
woodbine
in
just
about
four
hours
and
that
is
allowing
something
for
the
mountains
too
apache
equal
to
a
good
deal
better
time
but
i
should
hate
to
push
him
when
we
were
heading
toward
that
would
pay
up
for
any
amount
of
delay
thus
far
i
have
found
leslie
manor
as
hospitable
as
our
servant
quarters
at
woodbine
beverly
cheeks
were
as
red
as
aileen
and
her
eyes
snapping
as
menacingly
as
sally
by
the
time
she
had
come
to
the
end
of
her
very
deliberately
uttered
speech
though
she
had
not
moved
a
hair
breadth
upon
her
bench
nor
had
she
changed
her
position
her
head
was
propped
upon
her
hand
as
her
arm
rested
upon
the
back
of
the
seat
but
she
was
looking
straight
at
the
astonished
girls
as
she
spoke
never
had
there
been
a
more
complete
ambush
sprung
upon
a
reconnoitering
party
and
for
a
moment
both
girls
were
speechless
it
was
sally
who
saved
the
day
by
springing
away
from
aileen
and
landing
upon
the
seat
beside
beverly
as
she
cried
are
to
be
our
i
do
know
i
sure
i
got
to
be
i
suppose
and
been
assigned
a
and
from
your
conversation
which
i
could
very
well
help
overhearing
you
two
seem
to
have
been
assigned
b
and
c
for
study
but
i
just
given
vent
to
my
point
of
view
there
was
still
a
good
bit
of
electricity
in
the
atmosphere
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
for
the
past
eighteen
hours
beverly
had
been
pretty
steadily
brushed
the
wrong
way
and
it
was
an
entirely
new
experience
for
her
add
to
this
a
good
dose
of
homesickness
and
a
sense
of
utter
loss
at
her
separation
from
athol
and
her
present
frame
of
mind
is
not
difficult
to
understand
are
you
beverly
of
woodbine
persisted
sally
while
aileen
dropped
down
upon
the
seat
beside
sally
to
listen
yes
was
the
laconic
if
uncompromising
reply
well
that
the
best
news
i
heard
since
i
left
richmond
and
i
just
tickled
nearly
to
death
exclaimed
sally
spinning
about
to
hug
aileen
rapturously
this
sudden
change
of
base
was
so
astonishing
that
sense
of
humor
came
to
her
rescue
and
she
laughed
sally
again
pivoted
toward
her
crying
why
i
know
you
perfectly
well
i
known
you
all
my
life
and
you
know
me
just
as
well
as
i
know
you
do
you
know
you
do
not
so
that
it
overwhelms
me
laughed
beverly
where
did
you
meet
miss
ashby
asked
aileen
who
felt
it
was
about
time
she
came
in
for
this
wholesale
discovery
of
auld
acquaintance
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
this
is
aileen
norman
the
third
girl
for
suite
she
from
charlottesville
and
ought
to
know
your
family
too
i
reckon
you
know
hers
everybody
does
just
like
they
know
yours
why
your
mother
and
mine
went
to
catonsville
to
school
together
did
you
know
that
she
was
sarah
wirt
then
why
i
think
it
too
lovely
for
words
and
we
were
just
as
mad
as
fury
when
we
started
out
to
hunt
up
the
new
girl
we
had
to
room
with
this
year
and
here
you
are
a
new
girl
at
all
but
one
we
always
known
why
i
so
tickled
i
foolish
hug
me
aileen
or
it
will
all
seem
like
a
dream
and
i
wake
up
and
find
we
got
to
roost
with
someone
like
that
stupid
electra
sanderson
or
petty
gordon
who
ca
do
a
thing
but
talk
about
that
midshipman
at
annapolis
to
whom
she
says
she
engaged
and
she
only
just
seventeen
she
makes
me
tired
i
hope
you
forgive
us
for
all
we
said
as
we
came
down
the
walk
we
certainly
had
no
personal
feeling
as
you
must
understand
but
we
were
pretty
well
stirred
up
over
the
idea
of
having
to
begin
junior
year
with
someone
we
did
know
after
having
had
the
same
for
three
years
explained
aileen
diplomatically
striving
to
pour
a
drop
or
two
of
oil
upon
perturbed
waters
i
could
very
well
feel
any
resentment
toward
you
or
miss
conant
when
i
did
know
either
of
you
from
eve
and
i
sorry
if
i
seemed
to
the
truth
is
i
was
lonely
and
homesick
and
just
ready
to
light
into
anybody
is
miss
woodhull
always
so
high
and
mighty
and
miss
baylis
so
like
an
iceberg
mercy
did
you
fall
into
her
clutches
the
first
jump
she
the
limit
oh
miss
woodhull
so
deadly
afraid
she
wo
uphold
the
dignity
of
dear
bosting
and
her
massy
alma
mater
that
she
almost
dies
under
the
burden
but
thank
goodness
we
do
see
much
of
her
and
miss
baylis
is
a
fool
we
laugh
behind
her
back
she
trying
to
make
herself
solid
with
the
empress
because
she
thinks
she
will
succeed
to
her
honors
when
the
high
and
mighty
lady
retires
but
she
harmless
because
all
her
airs
and
graces
are
veneer
give
her
one
good
scratch
some
day
and
you
see
how
thin
the
veneer
really
is
but
come
on
up
to
no
and
let
get
settled
neither
aileen
nor
i
had
any
heart
to
do
a
thing
until
we
found
out
who
had
been
popped
into
cricky
but
i
glad
it
and
slipping
her
arm
through
beverly
right
one
while
aileen
took
possession
of
the
left
all
three
hurried
toward
the
house
sally
announcing
we
introduce
you
to
all
the
nice
girls
and
we
call
ourselves
the
three
mousquetaires
there
may
not
be
any
such
word
but
that
matter
in
the
least
it
frenchy
and
i
french
and
besides
we
mean
to
band
together
to
fight
for
our
rights
and
down
oppression
asserted
this
young
jacobin
as
arm
in
arm
all
three
made
their
way
to
the
pretty
suite
allotted
to
them
on
the
second
floor
of
the
wing
for
beverly
had
entered
leslie
manor
as
a
junior
her
previous
work
under
norman
lee
having
well
fitted
her
to
do
so
chapter
vii
a
runaway
by
the
end
of
october
the
golden
month
and
always
beautiful
in
virginia
things
had
shaken
into
routine
during
that
time
suite
number
had
become
one
of
the
most
popular
in
the
school
as
well
as
one
of
the
most
attractive
for
to
the
intense
satisfaction
of
the
trio
their
belongings
were
in
as
perfect
harmony
as
themselves
beverly
things
being
pink
sally
the
softest
green
and
aileen
all
white
and
gold
consequently
all
went
merry
as
a
marriage
bell
but
there
had
been
hours
of
intense
longing
upon
beverly
part
for
the
freedom
of
bygone
days
and
athol
the
brother
and
sister
had
been
entirely
too
united
in
every
way
to
find
perfect
compensation
in
the
companionship
of
others
however
warm
the
friendships
formed
and
each
missed
the
other
sorely
of
course
letters
had
been
exchanged
during
the
month
but
letters
are
a
poor
substitute
for
the
voice
of
those
we
love
best
only
ashby
realized
how
intense
was
the
brother
and
longing
to
see
each
other
archie
also
fumed
under
the
enforced
separation
and
vowed
that
something
was
going
to
break
loose
mighty
sudden
if
his
people
and
athol
did
get
busy
and
something
had
beverly
been
at
liberty
to
ride
apache
as
formerly
the
ten
miles
separating
the
two
schools
would
have
meant
merely
a
jolly
cross
country
run
but
she
was
only
permitted
to
ride
when
the
other
girls
rode
and
under
the
supervision
of
a
groom
who
was
held
responsible
for
his
charges
nor
had
the
boys
been
allowed
to
visit
beverly
the
male
sex
being
regarded
by
miss
woodhull
as
a
sort
of
natural
enemy
whose
sole
aim
in
life
was
to
circumvent
deprive
and
rob
hers
of
its
just
rights
miss
woodhull
was
essentially
a
militant
suffragette
and
her
stanch
admirers
miss
baylis
and
miss
stetson
were
her
enthusiastic
partisans
miss
atwell
the
teacher
of
esthetic
dancing
and
posing
who
came
thrice
weekly
to
instill
grace
into
the
graceless
and
emphasize
it
in
those
who
were
already
graceful
sat
so
to
speak
upon
the
fence
undecided
which
way
to
jump
she
inclined
strongly
to
the
strictly
feminine
attitude
of
dependence
upon
the
stronger
sex
but
was
wise
to
the
advantage
of
keeping
in
touch
with
those
occupying
the
seats
of
the
mighty
at
leslie
manor
at
kilton
hall
rules
were
less
stringent
the
boys
could
ride
every
afternoon
if
they
chose
and
often
did
so
ranging
the
country
far
and
wide
many
a
time
they
had
gone
tearing
past
leslie
manor
when
the
girls
were
stived
up
within
and
been
exasperated
at
being
so
near
and
yet
so
far
as
an
old
song
puts
it
hence
archie
frame
of
mind
and
his
determination
to
change
the
existing
state
of
affairs
before
long
if
possible
letters
sent
home
by
the
boys
and
those
beverly
wrote
to
her
mother
were
the
seeds
sown
which
the
three
hoped
would
later
start
the
something
doing
meanwhile
beverly
chafed
under
the
restraint
and
such
chafing
generally
leads
to
some
sort
of
an
outbreak
it
was
wednesday
afternoon
october
and
day
every
wednesday
and
saturday
andrew
jackson
jefferson
whose
name
was
as
queer
a
combination
as
himself
for
he
seemed
to
be
about
half
so
wonderful
was
his
understanding
of
those
animals
and
so
more
than
wonderful
of
him
took
his
ladies
de
windin
ob
de
kentry
roads
proud
as
a
drum
major
of
his
charges
and
well
he
might
be
for
andrew
jackson
jefferson
had
not
only
entire
charge
of
the
horses
belonging
to
leslie
manor
but
he
had
bought
them
and
he
knew
good
horseflesh
so
the
leslie
manor
horses
as
well
as
the
half
dozen
boarded
there
by
the
students
were
always
a
credit
to
the
school
their
coats
shone
like
satin
their
hoofs
were
spick
and
span
no
shoes
ever
clicked
for
want
of
the
proverbial
nail
fetlocks
were
trimmed
like
a
bridegroom
hair
and
manes
and
forelocks
brushed
to
the
silkiness
of
a
bride
harness
and
bits
were
scrupulous
jefferson
knew
his
business
when
apache
was
sent
to
leslie
manor
he
was
such
a
contrast
to
the
other
horses
that
jefferson
at
first
looked
askance
at
him
but
apache
was
a
wise
little
beast
as
a
preliminary
move
he
gently
nozzled
jefferson
then
by
way
of
showing
him
that
he
was
not
to
be
taken
too
seriously
he
flew
up
into
the
air
executed
a
wild
fling
and
descended
upon
the
exact
spot
from
which
he
had
risen
which
exhibition
so
tickled
jefferson
that
he
grinned
broadly
and
announced
to
his
underlings
dat
some
hawse
yo
hyar
me
befo
he
done
been
in
dis
hyre
stable
a
week
he
gwine
ter
be
eatin
outer
ma
hand
and
apache
verified
the
statement
by
becoming
jefferson
abject
slave
before
four
days
had
passed
and
beverly
basked
in
reflected
glory
for
was
she
not
kyant
tech
dat
chile
nothin
was
jefferson
fiat
when
he
saw
beverly
astride
her
little
and
white
mount
paht
ob
dat
hawse
there
had
already
been
several
riding
lessons
since
school
opened
and
each
time
jefferson
delight
in
his
newest
charges
increased
born
and
brought
up
with
the
race
beverly
knew
how
to
handle
the
negroes
and
jefferson
as
promptly
became
her
slave
as
apache
had
become
his
now
the
prescribed
route
for
these
riding
excursions
was
within
a
radius
of
the
school
no
further
said
miss
woodhull
those
bounds
seemed
safe
from
encroachment
upon
the
part
of
the
kilton
hall
students
even
had
their
wednesday
and
saturday
mornings
and
afternoons
not
been
entirely
given
over
to
athletics
thus
precluding
excursions
upon
horseback
as
a
rule
jefferson
took
out
eight
or
ten
girls
but
this
particular
wednesday
afternoon
several
had
obtained
permission
to
go
to
town
with
bonnell
to
do
some
shopping
have
some
photographs
taken
see
the
dentists
and
what
not
so
the
riders
were
reduced
to
sally
aileen
petty
gaylord
hope
macleod
a
senior
and
beverly
all
were
well
mounted
and
each
was
looking
her
best
in
her
trim
habit
it
was
customary
for
the
party
to
stop
at
the
porte
cochere
to
be
inspected
by
miss
woodhull
but
on
this
particular
afternoon
miss
woodhull
was
absent
at
a
social
function
in
the
neighborhood
and
the
duty
devolved
upon
miss
stetson
the
teacher
of
mathematics
a
lady
with
very
pronounced
views
she
dressed
as
nearly
like
a
man
as
was
compatible
with
law
and
decency
wore
her
hair
short
and
affected
a
masculine
stride
she
came
from
miss
woodhull
state
jefferson
drew
up
his
cavalcade
of
five
and
awaited
the
appearance
of
miss
stetson
whom
he
despised
with
all
your
true
negro
power
to
despise
white
folks
what
does
know
dey
is
white
miss
stetson
insisted
upon
calling
him
jefferson
affirming
that
the
race
never
be
or
indeed
wholly
emancipated
until
treated
as
the
equals
of
the
white
race
she
now
strode
out
upon
the
piazza
cast
a
critical
eye
upon
the
horses
nodded
and
said
very
fit
very
fit
quite
in
order
you
are
to
be
commended
jefferson
but
er
is
there
something
a
little
peculiar
in
the
appearance
of
your
horses
er
er
headgear
their
seem
to
be
exposed
more
than
usual
and
look
somewhat
bare
so
to
speak
can
it
be
possible
that
you
have
forgotten
something
fergot
queried
jefferson
looking
from
one
animal
to
the
other
ah
cyant
see
nothin
done
fergot
miss
what
it
look
lak
on
de
hawses
why
their
eyes
seem
so
prominent
they
seem
to
too
much
er
beverly
was
attacked
with
a
sudden
paroxysm
of
coughing
jefferson
nearly
disgraced
himself
but
managed
to
stammer
we
does
put
blinders
on
de
saddle
hawses
miss
but
ef
yer
says
so
i
tak
long
back
ter
de
stables
an
change
de
saddle
headstalls
fer
de
ones
tho
it
sure
would
look
mighty
no
no
certainly
not
it
was
merely
a
remark
in
passing
you
are
the
better
judge
of
the
requirements
i
dare
say
and
miss
stetson
beat
a
hasty
retreat
entirely
forgetting
to
warn
her
charges
against
venturing
beyond
bounds
could
she
have
seen
beverly
lips
set
she
might
have
grown
suspicious
the
riding
party
started
jefferson
muttering
ma
lawd
dat
suah
do
make
me
tired
blinders
on
ma
saddle
hawses
huh
jefferson
reckon
i
bettah
tek
ter
callin
her
angeline
angeline
being
miss
stetson
christian
name
when
the
grounds
of
the
school
were
left
a
few
miles
behind
her
beverly
drew
up
to
sally
side
and
said
significantly
she
did
not
tell
us
to
keep
within
bounds
she
forgot
to
she
was
too
busy
missing
the
blinders
laughed
sally
beverly
laughed
softly
and
continued
you
girls
hold
in
your
horses
when
we
gone
a
little
further
i
want
to
ride
on
ahead
with
jefferson
i
a
word
to
say
and
i
an
idea
he
is
in
a
receptive
mood
what
are
you
up
to
bev
asked
aileen
just
watch
out
we
take
a
new
route
today
unless
i
much
mistaken
and
touching
apache
lightly
with
her
heel
she
cavorted
to
side
he
had
been
too
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
of
miss
stetson
to
leave
room
for
any
others
your
darkie
is
not
unlike
a
horse
in
that
respect
his
brain
is
rarely
capable
of
holding
ideas
at
once
perhaps
that
explains
why
darkies
and
horses
are
usually
in
such
accord
as
apache
careened
against
jumbo
side
the
big
horse
gave
a
plunge
forward
which
jerked
jefferson
wits
back
to
his
surroundings
that
was
exactly
what
beverly
wished
lor
miss
you
done
scare
jumbo
an
me
foolish
he
exclaimed
striving
to
bring
jumbo
down
to
his
usual
easy
pace
for
the
tall
hack
had
resented
the
little
broncho
familiarity
though
he
could
not
know
that
his
own
grandsire
and
apache
were
the
same
jefferson
will
you
do
something
to
please
me
this
afternoon
she
asked
eagerly
i
shore
will
if
it
aint
gwine
ter
get
me
into
no
fuss
wid
de
misses
temporized
jefferson
it
wo
get
you
into
any
fuss
with
anybody
miss
woodhull
is
not
at
home
and
miss
stetson
was
too
busy
trying
to
find
out
where
the
horses
had
lost
their
blinders
to
tell
us
to
take
the
road
to
kilton
hall
jefferson
almost
chortled
so
when
we
come
to
that
road
will
you
turn
down
it
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
and
do
be
surprised
or
frightened
at
anything
apache
may
do
i
aint
scared
none
at
what
you
an
dat
hawse
doin
he
got
sense
and
added
jefferson
with
concession
so
has
you
i
aint
got
no
time
ter
be
a
troublin
it
dese
ladies
i
has
ter
bat
my
eyes
at
an
dey
shore
do
keep
me
busy
sometimes
now
what
i
tell
you
look
at
dat
and
as
though
in
sympathy
with
beverly
schemes
chicadee
the
little
mare
petty
gaylord
was
riding
chose
that
moment
to
shy
at
some
leaves
which
fluttered
to
the
ground
and
of
course
petty
shrieked
and
then
followed
up
the
shriek
with
the
which
punctuated
every
tenth
word
she
spoke
whether
apropos
or
not
that
was
exactly
the
cue
beverly
needed
a
slight
pressure
of
her
knee
upon
apache
side
was
sufficient
he
was
off
like
a
comet
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
entirely
beyond
his
rider
control
sally
and
aileen
laughed
outright
petty
stopped
her
giggle
to
scream
oh
she
being
run
away
with
not
so
much
as
it
would
seem
was
hope
macleod
quiet
comment
as
she
laid
in
place
a
lock
of
satin
gloss
mane
and
quieted
him
after
his
sympathetic
plunge
well
ef
she
is
she
but
i
bettin
she
knows
whar
she
said
andrew
jackson
jefferson
more
quietly
than
the
situation
seemed
to
warrant
but
just
de
same
i
thinkin
we
might
as
well
fool
oursefs
some
and
he
hastened
his
pace
the
others
doing
likewise
it
would
never
do
to
let
one
of
his
charges
be
run
away
with
and
not
make
an
effort
to
save
her
from
a
possible
calamity
chapter
viii
climaxes
meanwhile
the
runaways
were
having
the
very
time
of
their
lives
not
since
that
race
to
four
corners
for
the
letter
which
proved
the
wedge
to
divide
her
own
and
athol
ways
had
beverly
been
able
to
let
out
a
notch
as
she
put
it
nor
had
the
little
broncho
been
permitted
to
twinkle
his
legs
as
they
were
now
twinkling
over
that
soft
dirt
road
virginia
roads
were
made
for
equestrians
automobiles
head
thrust
forward
as
far
as
his
graceful
slender
neck
permitted
ears
laid
back
for
the
first
unwelcome
word
to
halt
eyes
flashing
with
exhilaration
and
nostrils
wide
for
the
deep
full
inhalations
and
exhalations
which
sent
the
rich
blood
coursing
through
each
pulsing
artery
little
apache
was
enjoying
his
freedom
as
much
as
his
rider
in
two
seconds
they
were
at
the
top
of
a
rise
of
ground
down
at
the
further
side
and
out
of
sight
of
the
others
then
to
make
the
exhibition
realistic
beverly
drew
out
her
hat
pin
gave
it
a
toss
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
the
wind
completed
the
job
by
whisking
her
soft
felt
hat
off
her
head
and
landing
it
upon
the
roadside
bush
oh
it
was
glorious
five
miles
what
were
five
miles
to
the
little
beastie
which
had
many
a
time
pounded
off
without
turning
a
hair
or
to
beverly
who
had
often
ridden
fifty
in
one
day
with
uncle
athol
and
her
brother
just
a
breather
and
when
there
swept
through
the
gateway
of
kilton
hall
a
most
exalted
hatless
lassie
mounted
upon
a
most
hilarious
steed
the
came
within
an
ace
of
having
apoplexy
for
she
was
a
portly
old
body
but
beverly
did
not
pause
for
explanations
her
objective
point
was
the
athletic
field
at
the
rear
of
the
building
and
her
appearance
upon
it
might
have
been
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
distinct
sensation
it
would
never
do
to
forsake
too
promptly
the
role
of
being
run
away
with
there
were
coaches
and
referees
upon
tennis
court
cinder
path
and
football
field
and
boys
galore
in
every
sort
of
athletic
garb
performing
every
sort
of
athletic
stunt
when
beverly
set
out
to
do
anything
she
rarely
omitted
any
detail
to
make
it
as
near
perfect
as
possible
as
she
tore
across
the
lawn
which
led
to
the
field
her
sharp
eyes
discovered
athol
upon
one
of
the
tennis
courts
and
closer
at
hand
a
lot
of
other
boys
sprinting
gracefully
or
otherwise
around
the
cinder
path
taking
hurdles
placed
about
a
hundred
feet
apart
now
if
there
was
one
thing
in
this
world
upon
which
apache
and
his
young
mistress
agreed
more
entirely
than
another
it
was
the
pure
delight
of
skimming
over
a
fence
a
was
a
mere
trifle
the
hurdles
upon
the
cinder
path
a
big
joke
the
tennis
nets
pouf
if
beverly
really
was
tugging
upon
apache
bridle
he
was
not
permitting
anything
so
trivial
as
a
girl
strength
to
bother
him
and
her
knees
told
him
quite
a
different
story
as
he
swept
upon
the
cinder
path
took
two
hurdles
like
a
deer
and
was
off
over
the
tennis
courts
and
over
a
net
before
the
astonished
players
could
draw
a
full
breath
then
they
woke
up
it
a
runaway
cried
cushman
who
had
charge
of
the
football
coaching
to
be
echoed
by
the
tall
quarter
back
in
football
togs
as
both
broke
away
in
pursuit
the
whole
field
quickly
taking
the
alarm
also
but
that
tennis
court
held
one
individual
whose
wits
worked
as
quickly
as
the
star
performer
and
there
and
then
shrilled
across
it
a
peculiar
whistle
which
they
both
knew
mighty
well
and
the
one
obeyed
instanter
by
wheeling
so
suddenly
that
he
put
a
very
realistic
climax
upon
the
scene
by
nearly
unseating
the
one
as
he
tore
pell
mell
for
the
whistler
and
came
to
a
sudden
halt
in
front
of
him
to
the
increased
astonishment
of
the
general
audience
gee
whiz
bev
what
let
loose
cried
athol
trying
to
respond
to
apache
nozzling
whinnying
demonstrations
of
delight
and
reach
his
sister
extended
hands
at
the
same
time
while
archie
did
his
sprint
across
the
gridiron
and
the
whole
field
came
boiling
toward
them
have
do
you
see
i
been
run
away
with
it
lucky
apache
turned
in
here
answered
beverly
with
remarkable
calmness
for
one
so
lately
escaped
from
disaster
or
sudden
death
as
she
brushed
back
her
flying
locks
for
well
reasons
run
away
nothing
run
away
with
piffle
ah
cut
it
out
apache
i
know
you
ready
to
throw
a
fit
at
seeing
me
but
keep
bottled
up
for
a
minute
wo
you
he
ended
as
apache
lay
hold
of
his
tennis
shirt
and
tried
to
jerk
him
into
attention
but
he
gave
the
bony
little
head
a
mauling
nevertheless
as
archie
rushing
up
exclaimed
you
a
winner
bev
then
the
others
surrounded
them
the
two
coaches
really
concerned
lest
the
young
lady
had
suffered
some
mishap
and
cushman
brushing
the
boys
aside
as
he
asked
are
you
faint
can
we
be
of
any
assistance
and
ford
the
new
instructor
from
yale
and
mighty
good
to
look
upon
so
decided
beverly
in
the
space
of
one
glance
pressed
to
her
side
to
ask
were
you
riding
alone
when
your
mount
bolted
before
beverly
could
draw
breath
to
reply
the
answer
came
from
another
quarter
now
there
is
no
such
accomplished
actor
or
liar
upon
the
face
of
the
round
world
as
your
genuine
darkey
indeed
he
can
do
both
so
perfectly
that
he
actually
lives
in
the
characters
he
temporarily
creates
and
believes
his
own
prevarications
and
that
it
must
be
admitted
is
when
beverly
departed
so
suddenly
upon
her
route
jefferson
naturally
had
but
a
very
hazy
idea
of
her
intentions
he
knew
kilton
hall
lay
over
five
miles
straight
ahead
and
he
knew
also
that
brother
was
at
school
there
but
jefferson
did
not
possess
an
analytical
mind
it
could
not
apache
he
knew
however
that
he
must
put
up
a
pretty
good
bluff
if
he
wished
to
save
his
kinky
scalp
upon
his
return
to
leslie
manor
so
he
set
about
planning
to
hand
out
dat
fool
a
corker
moreover
petty
was
inclined
to
take
the
situation
seriously
petty
was
sweetly
romantic
but
stupidly
literal
at
times
a
hopeless
combination
the
riding
party
had
cantered
along
in
the
fleeing
wake
for
a
little
more
than
a
mile
when
petty
spied
the
hat
upon
the
bush
nothing
further
was
needed
to
confirm
her
misgivings
she
been
run
away
with
girls
she
has
i
think
it
perfectly
awful
not
to
ride
faster
she
may
be
lying
on
the
road
by
this
time
jefferson
thought
it
might
be
politic
to
manifest
more
concern
so
throwing
a
anxiety
into
voice
and
manner
he
said
hastily
now
you
fo
ladies
jist
come
careful
an
orderly
so
not
ter
bring
no
mo
trebbulations
us
an
i
light
out
fer
dat
ma
lawd
been
clar
distracted
fer
de
las
ten
minutes
fer
ter
know
ter
i
aint
really
believe
miss
is
in
no
danger
miss
petty
done
got
me
so
sympathizin
but
now
shore
rattled
an
gwin
ter
find
out
fer
sartin
come
on
yo
jumbo
yo
laigs
fer
fair
and
under
touch
of
the
spur
the
big
horse
broke
into
a
gait
which
bade
fair
to
speedily
overhand
the
scapegraces
jefferson
let
him
do
a
turn
in
the
road
simplified
the
problem
now
don
yo
tak
ter
sweatin
so
i
has
ter
spend
a
hull
hour
yo
down
admonished
jefferson
when
well
out
of
sight
git
there
an
when
we
does
we
mak
one
fair
show
down
and
thereupon
jefferson
restrained
his
steed
to
a
long
swinging
run
which
told
off
the
miles
without
making
him
turn
a
hair
until
kilton
hall
was
in
sight
the
dusky
actor
and
his
mount
prepared
to
make
their
spectacular
entré
pulling
up
at
the
roadside
jefferson
threw
his
cap
upon
the
ground
twisted
his
tie
awry
and
let
fly
the
belt
of
his
riding
blouse
then
dismounting
he
caught
up
a
few
handfuls
of
dust
and
promptly
transformed
big
bay
jumbo
into
as
disreputable
looking
a
horse
as
dust
rubbed
upon
his
muzzle
his
chest
and
his
warm
moist
flanks
could
transform
him
it
was
this
likely
pair
which
came
pounding
across
the
athletic
field
of
kilton
hall
at
the
moment
of
ford
question
the
human
of
the
species
with
eyes
rolling
until
they
were
nearly
all
whites
shouting
as
he
drew
near
my
miss
is
yo
is
yo
daid
it
was
a
good
enough
bit
of
acting
to
have
won
the
actor
fame
and
fortune
as
a
matter
of
fact
beverly
gave
one
glance
at
the
figure
then
clasping
both
arms
around
apache
neck
buried
her
face
in
his
mane
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
collapsed
into
a
paroxysm
of
tears
to
the
entire
dismay
of
cushman
and
the
skeptical
sizing
up
of
the
situation
by
ford
more
lately
from
the
campus
it
was
athol
who
promptly
turned
a
few
handsprings
behind
their
backs
and
archie
who
rolled
over
upon
the
grass
chortling
do
be
alarmed
do
be
alarmed
my
good
man
your
young
lady
is
none
the
worse
for
her
involuntary
run
just
here
a
distinct
snort
came
from
the
ground
behind
cushman
though
i
dare
say
a
little
unstrung
and
exhausted
but
we
stopped
her
mount
yes
you
did
came
sotto
voce
from
athol
and
now
we
will
lead
your
mistress
back
to
the
house
where
kilton
will
be
delighted
to
minister
to
her
comfort
are
you
too
nervous
to
ride
to
the
rear
entrance
miss
ashby
for
during
the
few
words
spoken
cushman
had
discovered
that
this
was
athol
ashby
sister
had
the
resemblance
left
any
doubt
of
that
fact
beverly
resumed
an
upright
position
hastily
wiped
away
her
tears
one
laugh
as
well
as
weep
them
and
answered
oh
no
sir
of
course
i
was
a
little
startled
at
first
but
apache
is
never
vicious
and
it
was
only
the
need
of
exercise
which
made
us
bolt
you
know
the
acrobat
came
to
an
upright
position
and
very
nearly
upset
the
whole
show
meantime
jefferson
with
many
flutterings
and
gesticulations
had
dismounted
and
managed
to
work
his
way
to
archie
side
and
whisper
do

yo
suh
not
on
your
sweet
life
it
the
best
ever
but
where
the
rest
of
the
bunch
there
must

oh
cushman
the
groom
had
to
leave
the
other
young
ladies
back
yonder
on
the
road
and
he
a
good
bit
upset
about
it
had
he

they
be
scared
blue
you
know
certainly
certainly
by
all

at

this
young

be
carefully
looked

and
jefferson
lost
no
time
in
going
you
better
bring
the
whole
outfit
i
er
i
mean
you
better
bring
the
other
young
ladies
to
the
hall
called
ford
deciding
that
if
beverly
was
a
sample
of
the
leslie
manor
girls
it
would
be
just
as
well
to
see
more
of
the
material
had
he
caught
the
sudden
flash
in
eyes
perhaps
he
would
have
grown
a
bit
wiser
twenty
minutes
later
all
five
girls
were
seated
in
kilton
cozy
living
room
the
boys
and
the
instructors
who
had
shifted
into
garments
in
record
time
serving
hot
chocolate
and
little
iced
cakes
as
they
were
not
expected
home
until
five
anyway
there
was
no
cause
for
concern
there
would
be
no
alarm
at
leslie
manor
meanwhile
jefferson
who
had
looked
after
the
horses
was
holding
the
floor
in
the
quarters
if
a
report
of
that
afternoon
experiences
did
reach
leslie
manor
he
meant
to
have
first
scoop
after
an
hour
spent
very
delightfully
for
ford
was
attention
itself
to
beverly
to
archie
disgust
hope
macleod
advised
a
move
toward
home
as
they
were
about
to
start
beverly
asked
sweetly
oh
dear
kilton
would
you
mind
if
athol
showed
me
his
room
you
know
we
have
never
before
in
all
our
lives
been
separated
and
i
get
so
homesick
for
him
and
his
traps
it
just
seems
as
though
i
could
stand
it
why
of
course
you
may
go
up
my
dear
smiled
kindly
kilton
she
was
too
wholesome
to
see
the
least
impropriety
in
so
simple
a
request
oh
hold
on
a
second
ath
keep
her
a
minute
until
i
rush
up
and
stow
a
few
of
our
duds
we
did
stop
to
slick
things
up
when
we
shifted
and
archie
bounded
away
come
on
now
bev
i
reckon
he
had
time
to
make
number
presentable
said
athol
three
minutes
later
and
the
brother
and
sister
went
demurely
from
the
room
chapter
ix
while
goblins
danced
although
in
little
sympathy
with
frivolous
forms
of
entertainment
miss
woodhull
did
condescend
to
a
masquerade
each
year
and
two
nights
after
beverly
john
gilpin
performance
the
girls
were
preparing
for
the
dance
in
the
big
gymnasium
a
collection
had
been
taken
up
among
the
sixty
girls
constituting
the
academic
grades
and
a
couple
of
musicians
engaged
for
the
occasion
they
came
from
an
adjacent
town
where
they
formed
part
of
a
colored
orchestra
of
more
than
local
fame
which
was
in
great
demand
for
miles
around
consequently
the
girls
would
have
good
music
for
their
frolic
and
as
bonnell
looked
to
the
refreshments
everything
was
satisfactory
excepting
miss
woodhull
veto
upon
the
absurd
practices
of
meaning
the
love
tests
of
fate
and
fortune
usually
made
that
night
those
were
debarred
though
many
a
one
was
indulged
in
in
secret
of
which
that
practical
lady
little
kenned
as
a
hostess
and
chaperone
were
deemed
absolutely
indispensable
upon
any
occasion
however
informal
bonnell
was
always
eagerly
sought
after
by
the
girls
to
act
in
the
former
capacity
and
miss
dalton
the
gym
instructor
in
the
latter
miss
dalton
seemed
just
like
a
girl
herself
and
was
in
fact
not
many
years
her
pupils
senior
she
was
in
her
year
but
looked
about
nineteen
a
jolly
chummy
lovable
woman
though
no
instructor
maintained
better
discipline
or
was
more
willingly
obeyed
she
and
bonnell
worked
in
perfect
harmony
when
their
duties
brought
them
together
now
it
is
only
reasonable
to
surmise
that
beverly
and
the
boys
had
made
the
very
utmost
of
the
fifteen
minutes
spent
in
athol
room
the
previous
wednesday
and
some
communications
had
been
interchanged
on
the
way
back
to
leslie
manor
beverly
sally
and
aileen
had
kept
somewhat
in
the
rear
petty
and
hope
by
the
latter
finesse
contriving
to
keep
jefferson
between
them
this
had
not
been
difficult
because
jefferson
simply
to
have
someone
to
talk
to
what
the
three
in
the
rear
discussed
will
be
seen
later
those
leading
were
needlessly
trying
to
convince
jefferson
of
the
folly
of
making
any
reference
whatsoever
to
the
unexpected
route
taken
that
afternoon
had
they
only
known
it
he
was
as
anxious
as
they
were
to
keep
the
affair
from
headquarters
his
chief
misgivings
resting
in
the
possibility
of
the
report
coming
from
kilton
hall
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
never
occurred
to
either
or
kilton
to
report
it
it
was
a
mere
incident
which
had
ended
rather
pleasantly
than
otherwise
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
relations
between
the
two
schools
were
not
over
cordial
and
kilton
had
made
very
gracious
overtures
to
miss
woodhull
when
she
first
opened
leslie
manor
but
desiring
to
keep
distantly
at
arm
length
all
relations
with
a
school
that
harbored
boys
her
response
had
been
as
frigid
as
her
new
england
coast
line
in
february
this
was
rather
fortunate
in
the
present
case
and
kilton
not
only
requested
the
instructors
not
to
give
needless
publicity
to
the
affair
or
anxiety
to
miss
woodhull
by
permitting
any
report
of
the
runaway
to
become
circulated
but
also
warned
the
servants
and
forbade
the
boys
discussing
it
abroad
and
the
boys
were
wise
enough
to
put
two
and
two
together
so
a
discreet
silence
was
maintained
and
miss
woodhull
spared
a
nerve
shock
at
on
suite
number
buzzed
like
a
the
three
occupants
were
dressing
two
or
three
girls
were
assisting
at
the
robing
and
two
or
three
more
who
were
already
costumed
were
acting
as
spectators
beverly
was
going
as
her
costume
consisting
of
funny
little
ruffled
trousers
a
lord
fauntleroy
shirt
jacket
and
collar
her
hair
braided
and
tucked
inside
her
waist
and
her
head
covered
by
a
huge
glengarry
bonnet
tiny
pumps
and
little
blue
socks
completed
the
funny
makeup
she
was
as
bonny
a
little
lad
as
one
could
find
her
name
being
plainly
printed
upon
her
big
collar
who
would
complete
the
pair
by
being
no
one
had
been
able
to
coax
from
her
her
reply
to
all
the
girl
importunities
being
just
wait
and
see
if
we
do
match
well
sally
was
to
be
and
a
plump
spooky
sprite
she
made
with
dabs
of
phosphorus
upon
her
fluttering
black
cambric
costume
and
funny
peaked
cap
which
glowed
uncannily
when
the
room
was
darkened
she
carried
a
little
electric
bulb
lantern
which
unexpectedly
flashed
its
blinding
rays
into
people
faces
aileen
chose
to
be
the
evening
star
and
very
lovely
she
looked
in
her
costume
made
of
several
scarfs
draped
over
one
of
her
dainty
nighties
which
of
course
fell
straight
from
her
shoulders
her
hair
was
caught
up
with
every
rhinestone
pin
or
buckle
she
owned
or
could
borrow
and
bonnell
had
supplied
from
the
properties
kept
for
private
theatricals
the
glittering
star
she
wore
above
her
forehead
aileen
moved
a
goddess
and
she
looked
a
queen
for
she
was
a
very
stately
lovely
young
girl
at
the
stroke
of
eight
all
were
ready
and
a
general
rush
was
made
for
the
gym
the
girls
laughing
talking
jostling
each
other
and
in
most
hilarious
mood
but
when
they
reached
that
gaily
decorated
room
was
not
among
them
the
gym
presented
a
pretty
picture
that
night
lighted
by
pumpkin
jack
lanterns
in
which
electric
bulbs
had
been
hidden
and
by
grotesque
paper
lanterns
representing
bats
owls
and
all
sorts
of
flying
nocturnal
creatures
the
side
walls
had
been
covered
with
gorgeous
autumn
foliage
palms
and
potted
rubber
plants
stood
all
about
and
last
but
by
no
means
least
there
was
a
long
table
laden
with
goodies
and
more
pumpkin
decorations
the
room
was
a
fitting
scene
for
goblin
revels
a
barn
dance
had
just
begun
when
down
through
the
gym
pranced
and
so
identical
were
the
figures
that
no
mortal
being
could
have
told
one
from
the
other
had
they
chanced
to
become
separated
but
this
they
seemed
to
have
no
intention
of
doing
together
they
went
through
the
figures
of
the
pretty
fancy
dance
prancing
twirling
advancing
retreating
arms
clasped
or
held
above
each
other
heads
feet
twinkling
in
perfect
time
heads
nodding
eyes
dancing
through
the
peepers
of
their
little
black
lips
smiling
to
reveal
faultless
teeth
in
two
minutes
everybody
was
asking
who
it
who
they
how
they
look
so
exactly
alike
we
did
know
there
were
two
girls
in
the
school
who
matched
so
well
and
who
could
do
everything
so
exactly
alike
but
neither
nor
enlightened
the
questioners
indeed
neither
spoke
one
word
signs
having
to
answer
to
all
queries
presently
the
musicians
struck
up
a
hornpipe
when
away
they
went
in
the
jolliest
dance
eyes
ever
looked
upon
and
would
have
absorbed
all
attention
had
not
a
new
diversion
been
created
just
then
during
their
prancing
sally
in
her
costume
had
been
darting
in
and
out
between
the
tall
potted
plants
and
bowers
constructed
of
autumn
leaves
her
luminous
tatters
fluttering
and
her
dancing
light
blinding
every
dancer
into
whose
face
she
flashed
it
just
as
and
were
in
the
height
of
their
performance
she
darted
from
her
bosky
nook
and
flitted
down
the
room
closely
followed
by
a
tall
jack
o
lantern
with
his
pumpkin
light
no
one
in
the
room
was
so
tall
who
could
it
be
there
was
just
one
person
in
the
school
who
might
look
as
tall
if
so
disguised
and
that
was
miss
stetson
but
even
the
liveliest
imagination
could
hardly
fancy
miss
stetson
in
that
guise
moreover
miss
stetson
could
never
have
pranced
with
such
supple
grace
as
this
dancing
jack
was
prancing
after
the
no
it
could
not
be
miss
stetson
towering
above
the
nimble
little
will
jack
cavorted
swung
his
lantern
and
by
signs
indicated
his
desire
to
imitate
and
performances
to
which
will
promptly
acceded
and
the
quartette
hornpipe
was
on
now
it
was
miss
woodhull
custom
to
grace
all
festive
occasions
by
her
presence
just
prior
to
the
stroke
of
when
refreshments
were
served
the
revelers
were
to
unmask
before
partaking
of
the
feast
after
the
feast
they
were
at
liberty
to
dance
until
but
not
a
moment
later
the
fun
was
at
its
height
and
had
danced
with
every
other
goblin
the
evening
star
included
though
it
must
be
confessed
that
had
been
unanimously
pronounced
the
better
leader
by
his
partners
and
jack
almost
as
good
as
a
boy
she
was
so
strong
and
danced
so
divinely
though
none
had
as
yet
guessed
the
identity
of
either
then
miss
woodhull
escorted
by
miss
baylis
entered
the
gym
had
it
been
possible
to
suddenly
reduce
the
temperature
of
the
room
and
thus
congeal
the
dancers
the
effect
produced
could
hardly
have
been
more
chilling
from
the
merriest
most
hilarious
frolicing
the
gayest
cheeriest
bantering
and
laughter
to
the
utmost
decorum
was
the
transformation
effected
in
two
minutes
after
miss
woodhull
and
miss
baylis
entrance
with
the
exception
of
and
jack
o
lantern
the
girls
ceased
dancing
and
stood
in
groups
and
even
the
musicians
played
more
softly
there
was
not
the
vestige
of
a
smile
on
miss
woodhull
face
as
she
looked
upon
the
four
dancers
she
tolerated
such
frivolity
she
was
compelled
to
do
so
her
school
would
have
been
unpopular
had
she
not
done
so
other
schools
approved
of
them
raising
her
lorgnettes
she
looked
sharply
at
the
four
dancing
figures
then
turning
to
bonnell
who
had
crossed
from
the
table
to
receive
her
she
asked
who
is
that
strikingly
tall
figure
in
the
jack
o
lantern
costume
i
did
not
know
we
had
so
tall
a
girl
in
the
school
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
miss
woodhull
she
came
in
after
the
dancing
began
she
sustains
the
character
well
does
she
i
wish
to
know
she
is
send
someone
for
her
if
you
please
answered
the
principal
ignoring
the
question
she
was
a
little
doubtful
of
that
tall
girl
in
times
gone
by
some
of
her
pupils
had
been
guilty
of
indiscretions
if
this
were
a
repetition
it
must
be
nipped
in
the
bud
bonnell
beckoned
to
one
of
the
masqueraders
a
jolly
little
tam
shanta
and
bade
him
bring
jack
he
nodded
and
instantly
darted
off
in
pursuit
of
him
as
well
have
tried
to
capture
the
original
of
the
character
the
mad
chase
lasted
perhaps
five
minutes
miss
woodhull
was
powerless
how
could
she
accuse
jack
of
disrespect
to
her
or
disregard
of
her
commands
when
he
could
not
possibly
have
known
them
he
was
only
acting
his
part
to
perfection
any
way
besides
tam
never
had
caught
the
goblins
the
shoe
had
been
on
the
other
foot
but
at
that
second
jack
tripped
over
a
ring
set
in
the
floor
of
the
gym
and
went
sprawling
his
pumpkin
lantern
flying
out
of
his
hand
and
breaking
into
a
dozen
fragments
tam
was
almost
upon
him
but
before
he
could
lay
hold
jack
was
up
again
had
made
a
spring
caught
one
of
the
flying
rings
which
dangled
high
above
his
head
swung
like
a
monkey
from
that
to
the
next
and
so
on
down
the
line
until
he
was
in
range
of
the
gallery
at
which
he
hurled
himself
bodily
landed
upon
the
railing
balanced
a
and
was
safe
upon
the
gallery
floor
to
the
boundless
amazement
of
the
onlookers
and
absolute
banishment
of
their
suspicions
regarding
the
identity
of
miss
stetson
that
spring
settled
his
fate
with
miss
woodhull
no
girl
in
leslie
manor
could
have
performed
such
a
feat
and
all
the
dancers
were
staring
speechless
it
was
the
ominous
silence
before
the
storm
that
masquerader
is
not
a
girl
miss
bonnell
it
is
some
boy
who
has
perpetrated
this
outrage
miss
baylis
order
all
the
outer
doors
closed
and
guarded
and
a
thorough
search
made
this
matter
shall
be
sifted
to
the
very
bottom
no
you
will
all
remain
in
this
room
and
immediately
unmask
under
bonnell
eyes
i
shall
superintend
the
search
and
miss
woodhull
sailed
majestically
from
the
room
chapter
x
the
search
we
in
for
it
whispered
to
as
the
two
comical
figures
drew
unobtrusively
into
the
rear
of
the
group
of
girls
now
removing
their
masks
under
bonnell
eyes
for
she
began
to
suspect
that
some
sort
of
innocent
prank
had
been
played
which
like
many
another
would
have
harmlessly
played
itself
out
if
let
alone
she
had
always
been
opposed
to
the
rigorous
ban
placed
upon
boys
and
their
visits
to
leslie
manor
by
miss
woodhull
believing
and
justifiably
too
that
such
arbitrary
rules
only
led
to
a
livelier
desire
in
the
girls
to
meet
said
boys
by
hook
or
by
crook
hush
whispered
and
come
behind
this
rubber
plant
now
get
down
on
your
hands
and
knees
and
follow
me
promptly
obeyed
orders
and
the
next
moment
was
in
front
of
the
spiral
stairway
which
led
to
the
gallery
make
yourself
as
small
as
possible
and
crawl
on
your
up
this
staircase
at
the
other
end
of
the
gallery
is
a
door
leading
into
our
wing
i
ca
tell
you
another
thing
just
use
your
wits
and
flitted
back
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
crowd
of
girls
who
once
more
restored
to
an
equable
frame
of
mind
were
laughing
merrily
everyone
asking
everyone
else
if
she
knew
who
the
jack
o
lantern
really
was
this
very
fact
was
sufficient
reassurance
for
bonnell
she
knew
girls
better
than
miss
woodhull
knew
them
in
spite
of
having
else
for
more
than
forty
years
but
she
resolved
then
and
there
not
to
ask
too
many
questions
which
fact
made
two
girls
her
slaves
for
life
the
discipline
department
was
not
her
province
nor
was
it
one
which
anything
could
have
induced
her
to
undertake
if
was
aware
of
the
name
of
her
partner
in
the
quartette
hornpipe
or
knew
surname
miss
woodhull
was
the
one
to
find
it
out
not
she
so
smiling
upon
the
group
before
her
she
asked
are
you
now
all
visible
to
the
naked
eye
and
all
accounted
for
if
so
let
us
to
the
feast
for
time
is
speeding
no
urging
was
needed
and
lots
were
promptly
drawn
for
the
privilege
of
cutting
the
fate
cake
bonnell
had
not
considered
it
necessary
to
mention
the
fact
that
she
had
ordered
aunt
sally
the
cook
to
bake
one
for
the
occasion
and
while
good
fellowship
and
hilarity
reign
below
let
us
follow
two
less
fortunate
mortals
whom
the
witches
seemed
to
have
marked
for
their
sport
that
night
agreeable
with
miss
woodhull
orders
miss
baylis
who
was
only
too
delighted
to
shine
so
advantageously
in
her
superior
eyes
had
scuttled
away
issuing
as
she
went
the
order
to
close
outer
doors
and
guard
them
allowing
no
one
to
pass
through
guileless
souls
both
hers
and
miss
woodhull
though
another
adjective
might
possibly
be
more
apt
the
house
had
a
few
windows
as
well
as
doors
meeting
miss
stetson
on
the
stairs
she
found
in
her
a
militant
coadjutor
and
wireless
could
not
have
flashed
the
orders
more
quickly
servants
went
until
one
might
have
suspected
the
presence
of
a
criminal
in
leslie
manor
rather
than
a
mere
boy
meanwhile
what
of
jack
o
lantern
and
jack
it
must
be
admitted
had
the
greater
advantage
in
having
made
a
quicker
but
leslie
manor
had
many
bewildering
turns
and
corners
and
when
one
has
been
an
inmate
of
a
house
less
than
well
we
wo
specify
the
length
of
time
one
can
not
be
blamed
for
growing
confused
jack
had
made
for
the
very
door
had
advised
to
make
for
and
darted
through
it
muttering
as
he
paused
a
second
to
listen
gee
i
wish
i
was
so
confoundedly
long
legged
no
sound
coming
to
his
ears
from
any
of
the
rooms
opening
upon
the
corridor
into
which
he
had
darted
he
sprinted
down
its
length
until
it
terminated
suddenly
in
a
flight
of
stairs
leading
to
the
lower
hall
he
had
descended
about
half
way
when
a
babel
of
voices
sent
him
scuttling
back
again
and
a
moment
later
a
voice
commanded
wesley
hurry
up
to
the
south
wing
whoever
is
in
the
house
certainly
tried
to
make
an
escape
from

night
an
awesome
one
and
not
to
be
regarded
lightly
moreover
nearly
all
the
electric
lights
were
turned
off
only
those
necessary
to
light
the
halls
being
left
on
and
this
fact
made
the
rooms
seem
the
darker
now
jack

costume
like
had
been
liberally
daubed
with
phosphorus
and
he
still
grasped
the
electric
which
had
illuminated
his
shattered
pumpkin
there
was
no
time
to
stand
upon
ceremony
for
wesley
was
almost
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
a
door
stood
open
at
hand
and
he
darted
through
it
into
the
room
overturning
a
chair
in
the
darkness
hi
you
i
done

shouted
his
dusky
pursuer
and
burst
into
the
room
in
hot
chase
the
next
instant
the
exaltant
shout
changed
to
a
howl
of
terror
for
in
the
middle
of
that
room
stood
a
towering
motionless
figure
from
which
radiated
sheets
of
lightning
one
blinding
flash
darting
straight
into
the
terrified

nor

and
miss
stetson
the
was
obliged
to
go
up
to
investigate
but
though
every
room
was
searched
there
was
no
sign
of
mortal
being
all
the
window
sashes
in
leslie
manor
had
been
rehung
in
the
most
approved
modern
methods
and
could
be
raised
and

without

sound
a

and
a

are
quite
as
available
as
flying
rings
to
a
born
acrobat
as
she
was
returning
from
her
fruitless
search
she
encountered
miss
woodhull
well
queried
that
lady
it
is
well
if
there
really
was
any
one
in
that
wing
which
i
am
compelled
to
doubt
he
has
made
a
most
amazing
escape
doubt
repeated
miss
woodhull
with
no
little
asperity
you
will
hardly
doubt
the
evidence
of
my
own
eyesight
will
you
miss

i
that
person
cross
the
gallery
and
enter
the
south
wing
be
good
enough
to
go
down
to
the
gymnasium
and
call
the
roll
i
desire
to
know
if
all
the
girls
are
accounted
for
to
judge
by
miss
stetson
expression
she
was
none
too
well
pleased
by
the
principal
tone
nevertheless
she
repaired
to
the
gym
and
ignoring
bonnell
assurance
that
no
girls
were
missing
proceeded
to
call
the
roll
of
course
all
responded
meanwhile
miss
woodhull
had
summoned
jefferson
who
if
no
less
superstitious
was
backed
up
by
her
august
presence
and
together
they
mounted
the
stairs
and
made
a
inspection
peering
into
every
closet
or
any
possible
hiding
place
not
a
sign
of
human
being
was
found
until
they
came
to
the
study
of
suite
then
a
faint
sound
was
audible
in
bedroom
a
beyond
quicker
than
it
would
seem
possible
for
a
person
of
her
proportions
to
move
miss
woodhull
entered
the
study
reached
the
electric
switch
and
turned
on
the
lights
calling
at
the
same
moment
who
is
in
that
room
there
was
no
reply
and
the
irate
lady
speedily
covering
the
distance
between
the
electric
switch
and
the
bedroom
door
turned
on
the
light
in
that
room
also
there
stood
he
had
removed
his
mask
and
was
about
to
don
a
long
gray
automobile
coat
what
are
you
doing
here
beverly
when
i
gave
explicit
orders
that
no
one
should
leave
the
gymnasium
demanded
miss
woodhull
frowning
portentously
upon
the
delinquent
my
costume
is
so
thin
i
was
cold
i
came
up
after
my
coat
miss
woodhull
was
the
smiling
answer
spoken
quite
softly
enough
to
turn
away
wrath
you
came
in
direct
disobedience
to
my
orders
you
may
now
remain
here
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
oh
please
miss
woodhull
let
me
go
back
they
are
to
have
a
reel
begged
her
victim
no
i
have
spoken
you
will
remain
in
your
room
without
more
ado
the
defrauded
one
hurled
herself
into
the
middle
of
the
bed
buried
her
head
in
the
immaculate
pillows
and
burst
into
a
paroxysm
of
sobs
you
have
brought
this
upon
yourself
had
you
obeyed
me
there
would
have
been
no
occasion
for
this
punishment
i
was
freezing
i
just
wo
stay
stived
up
here
while
all
the
girls
are
having
such
fun
in
the
gym
it
is
fair
i
have
done
a
single
thing
but
get
this
coat
was
sobbed
from
the
bed
as
a
vigorous
kick
sent
the
eiderdown
cover
flying
almost
in
miss
woodhull
face
a
little
more
energy
would
have
compassed
it
miss
woodhull
deigned
no
reply
but
turning
swept
from
the
room
locking
the
door
behind
her
she
could
deal
summarily
with
rebellious
pupils
then
the
search
was
resumed
under
her
eagle
eye
but
without
results
not
a
creature
was
to
be
found
and
dismissing
her
followers
she
returned
to
the
gym
to
get
miss
stetson
report
are
the
older
pupils
present
she
asked
they
are
replied
miss
stetson
somewhat
icily
excepting
beverly
ashby
of
course
beverly
ashby
is
here
she
is
standing
in
the
group
near
the
table
corrected
miss
stetson
with
some
satisfaction
impossible
i
have
just
this
moment
locked
her
in
her
room
for
disobedience
and
insolence
you
are
mistaken
hardly
as
you
may
convince
yourself
by
merely
looking
miss
woodhull
did
look
and
for
a
moment
felt
as
though
caught
in
the
spell
of
that
mystic
night
beverly
ashby
stood
laughing
and
talking
with
sally
conant
aileen
and
bonnell
as
merry
a
little
as
one
could
picture
miss
woodhull
caught
her
eye
and
motioned
her
to
approach
ye
gods
and
little
fishes
whispered
beverly
to
sally
as
she
left
the
group
and
went
toward
miss
woodhull
that
lady
expression
was
most
forbidding
why
are
you
here
she
demanded
icily
beverly
looked
at
her
innocently
as
she
answered
i
do
think
i
quite
understand
you
miss
woodhull
not
understand
me
is
your
intellect
impaired
did
i
not
order
you
to
remain
in
your
room
for
the
remainder
of
this
evening
no
miss
woodhull
miss
woodhull
turned
crimson
such
barefaced
audacity
was
unheard
of
how
did
you
manage
to
leave
the
room
may
i
inquire
i
have
not
left
the
room
since
i
entered
it
at
eight
miss
woodhull
bonnell
called
the
now
thoroughly
exasperated
principal
did
you
see
beverly
ashby
return
to
this
gymnasium
less
than
ten
minutes
ago
beverly
has
not
been
of
it
miss
woodhull
she
has
been
enjoying
her
refreshments
with
the
other
pupils
ridiculous
miss
stetson
perhaps
have
a
clearer
idea
of
facts
since
i
requested
you
to
return
to
the
gymnasium
and
call
the
roll
was
beverly
present
when
you
did
so
she
was
standing
not
ten
feet
from
me
miss
woodhull
of
this
i
am
positive
because
her
cap
fell
from
her
head
as
she
replied
and
delayed
the
response
of
the
girl
next
on
the
roll
who
stopped
to
pick
it
up
i
believe
you
are
all
irresponsible
these
silly
customs
have
turned
your
heads
i
have
never
approved
such
inane
proceedings
why
you
may
as
well
try
to
convince
me
that
i
myself
did
not
enter
suite
and
that
i
did
not
speak
to
beverly
ashby
in
it
not
ten
minutes
ago
and
leave
her
there
in
the
middle
of
her
bed
weeping
and
conducting
herself
like
a
spoiled
child
because
she
could
not
participate
in
the
closing
virginia
reel
utter
nonsense
utter
nonsense
but
we
will
have
no
more
hoodwinking
rest
assured
there
has
been
quite
enough
already
you
may
all
go
to
your
rooms
reels
or
no
reels
i
have
experienced
enough
folly
for
one
night
if
not
much
worse
for
a
second
there
was
profound
silence
then
a
general
cry
of
protest
arose
to
be
defrauded
of
their
virginia
reel
for
no
justifiable
reason
and
sent
to
bed
before
ten
like
a
lot
of
naughty
children
when
they
really
had
not
done
a
single
thing
was
too
much
petty
wept
openly
petty
griefs
sorrow
or
joys
could
invariably
find
prompt
relief
in
tears
or
giggles
she
existed
in
a
perpetual
state
of
emotion
of
some
sort
aileen
murmured
look
at
miss
stetson
face
she
does
know
whether
to
frown
or
smile
she
will
lose
her
reason
presently
oh
why
need
the
empress
have
come
in
at
all
we
were
having
such
fun
and
sally
paused
significantly
beverly
nodded
a
quick
comprehension
of
what
the
conclusion
of
sentence
would
have
been
and
said
under
cover
of
the
babel
of
voices
for
even
the
empress
stalking
along
ahead
of
her
rebellious
ones
could
not
entirely
subdue
their
protests
and
i
am
wondering
what
we
shall
find
up
in
number
and
especially
in
bedroom
a
and
in
spite
of
those
possibilities
she
laughed
softly
and
not
a
single
mouthful
of
that
delicious
spread
after
those
ten
miles
i
call
it
a
perfect
outrage
muttered
sally
like
a
distant
beverly
flashed
one
quizzical
tantalizing
glance
at
her
do
let
worry
you
she
said
what
whispered
sally
eagerly
hush
listen
to
the
empress
oh
is
this
the
richest
you
ever
heard
chapter
xi
de
hants
done
got
dis
hyer
house
sure
they
had
now
reached
the
south
corridor
miss
woodhull
in
the
full
force
of
her
convictions
again
heading
straight
for
suite
and
bedroom
a
in
order
to
substantiate
her
statement
of
having
within
the
past
twenty
minutes
locked
beverly
in
she
was
affirming
in
no
doubtful
voice
to
miss
stetson
there
is
no
reason
that
i
should
try
to
justify
myself
or
endeavor
to
prove
that
my
faculties
are
unimpaired
unless
i
choose
to
do
so
but
i
prefer
to
convince
both
you
and
bonnell
that
i
generally
know
what
i
am
talking
about
you
will
find
that
door
securely
locked
they
needed
no
urging
but
the
door
opened
at
a
touch
locks
nevertheless
and
notwithstanding
the
light
was
switched
on
instanter
the
room
was
absolutely
undisturbed
likewise
the
bed
the
puff
cover
so
lately
hurtling
through
space
and
straight
for
miss
woodhull
august
head
lay
neatly
folded
in
a
triangle
across
the
foot
of
the
bed
the
pillow
case
did
not
show
a
line
or
crease
the
spread
was
absolutely
unrumpled
in
short
not
one
single
thing
was
out
of
place
or
tumbled
the
room
might
not
have
been
occupied
for
hours
so
far
as
any
sign
of
disturbance
was
evident
miss
stetson
looked
just
a
trifle
skeptical
bonnell
lips
twitched
a
bit
at
the
corners
though
her
face
was
most
respectfully
sober
with
one
withering
glance
at
beverly
the
teachers
and
all
concerned
miss
woodhull
remarked
scathingly
if
you
were
capable
of
such
expedition
in
worthier
causes
you
would
lead
the
school
and
glancing
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
swept
from
the
room
you
are
to
retire
at
once
and
no
noise
young
ladies
ordered
miss
stetson
divided
between
satisfaction
at
having
proved
her
statement
regarding
beverly
presence
in
the
gym
and
her
resentment
at
being
doubted
at
the
outset
bonnell
had
already
retreated
to
her
special
sanctum
there
to
have
a
quiet
laugh
over
the
whole
absurd
situation
she
had
guessed
of
course
who
and
jack
o
lantern
were
and
in
spite
of
rules
to
the
contrary
thought
it
a
rather
good
joke
than
otherwise
presently
she
would
send
the
servants
into
the
gym
to
clear
away
the
remains
of
the
feast
but
she
would
have
her
laugh
first
miss
baylis
whose
room
was
in
the
main
building
with
the
seniors
had
repaired
thither
to
enforce
compliance
with
miss
woodhull
commands
no
easy
task
for
some
of
the
girls
were
long
past
baby
days
and
resented
baby
treatment
the
other
teachers
also
had
their
hands
full
consequently
the
south
wing
was
left
entirely
to
miss
supervision
and
the
south
wing
was
a
pretty
sizable
building
and
naturally
under
existing
circumstances
it
did
not
simmer
down
as
promptly
as
under
ordinary
conditions
miss
stetson
was
compelled
to
go
from
room
to
room
girls
be
quick
get
undressed
as
fast
as
you
can
and
put
out
your
light
urged
beverly
what
up
demanded
sally
who
was
inclined
to
dawdle
from
very
perversity
springing
another
one
on
us
bev
asked
aileen
laughing
softly
but
hastily
complying
with
orders
beverly
vouchsafed
no
answer
beyond
a
significant
little
jerk
of
her
head
in
five
minutes
the
lights
were
out
in
a
b
and
c
and
study
was
in
darkness
also
miss
stetson
ever
suspicious
tiptoed
back
to
peep
in
but
found
nothing
amiss
then
a
new
outbreak
far
down
the
corridor
summoned
her
to
that
end
and
number
was
for
the
time
being
left
in
peace
this
was
the
cue
beverly
let
about
five
minutes
pass
then
slipped
out
of
bed
and
into
her
bathrobe
and
bedroom
slippers
in
a
jiffy
sally
and
aileen
needed
no
hint
to
follow
suit
come
quick
whispered
beverly
number
was
fortunately
or
unfortunately
nearer
the
door
leading
to
the
gym
gallery
than
some
other
suites
the
corridor
was
now
conveniently
dark
the
lights
having
been
extinguished
by
miss
stetson
only
the
patches
of
moonlight
shining
through
the
windows
showed
the
prowlers
which
way
to
turn
in
two
seconds
the
gallery
door
was
reached
and
the
three
were
upon
the
gym
side
of
it
now
miss
woodhull
pet
economy
was
lights
and
woe
betide
the
luckless
inmate
of
leslie
manor
who
needlessly
used
electricity
the
girls
often
said
that
if
the
house
ever
caught
fire
miss
woodhull
would
pause
in
rushing
from
it
to
switch
off
any
electric
bulb
left
burning
from
sheer
force
of
habit
she
had
switched
off
the
lights
in
the
gym
as
she
hurried
from
it
a
key
happening
to
be
at
the
side
of
the
door
through
which
she
led
her
brood
that
the
of
the
crowd
might
have
stumbled
over
something
was
a
trifling
consideration
beverly
quick
wits
which
had
grasped
many
details
of
miss
idiosyncrasies
had
taken
in
this
one
it
served
her
turn
now
the
gym
was
lighted
only
by
moonlight
and
silent
as
silence
itself
the
girls
tittered
is
the
joke
on
you
bev
asked
aileen
oh
look
quick
whispered
sally
beverly
merely
nodded
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
something
glowed
uncannily
then
two
figures
stole
into
a
patch
of
moonlight
one
tall
and
tattered
the
other
enveloped
in
a
long
garment
which
resembled
a
girl
coat
and
from
out
the
darkness
came
a
sepulchral
whisper
where
the
dickens
did
you
say
that
key
was
under
the
last
beverly
whispered
back
ca
you
find
it
ah
i
looked
under
the
first
one
was
the
disgusted
answer
did
you
get
the
box
yes
i
got
it
all
replied
the
taller
figure
and
now
going
to
beat
it
did
you
get
ragged
again
nothing
stirring
but
we
wanted
to
be
sure
you
got
the
eats
great
whispered
beverly
so
long
and
spook
number
one
having
evidently
found
the
key
in
question
made
for
a
door
which
gave
upon
the
rear
terrace
just
as
he
was
about
to
insert
the
key
the
door
was
opened
from
the
outside
and
wooley
head
was
outlined
in
the
moonlight
the
spooks
darted
behind
the
refreshment
table
and
the
three
watchers
dropped
into
inconspicuous
heaps
upon
the
gallery
floor
wesley
had
entered
with
his
pass
key
in
compliance
with
orders
the
maids
who
were
to
help
him
had
lingered
to
get
their
trays
wesley
would
have
given
a
good
deal
could
the
clearing
up
have
been
deferred
until
the
light
of
day
but
he
was
obliged
to
obey
bonnell
whar
dose
fool
gals
at
wid
dey
trays
he
muttered
seem
lak
gals
never
whar
yo
want
yo
want
an
pintedly

when
don
ma
lawd
whar

switch

he
ended
as
he
clawed
about
the
dark
wall
at
the
side
of
the
door
for
the
duplicate
of
the
switch
miss
woodhull
had
so
carefully
turned
off
as
he
found
it
a
groan
just
behind
him
caused
him
to
swing
sharply
about
unless
one
has
heard
a
darkie
howl
of
terror
at
what
he
believes
to
be
an
apparition
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
convey
any
idea
of
its
weirdness
wesley
tried
to
reach
the
door
so
did
the
tall
spook
the
result
was
a
collision
which
sent
wesley
heels
over
head
and
before
he
could
scramble
to
his
feet
again
two
spooks
instead
of
one
had
vanished
with
a
second
howl
the
darkie
shot
across
the
gym
and
out
of
the
door
which
led
into
the
main
building
where
his
cries
speedily
brought
an
audience
to
which
he
protested
that
de
hants
done
got
dis
house
suah
and
so
successfully
drew
attention
to
the
main
floor
that
the
three
girls
had
no
difficulty
in
slipping
back
to
number
and
raising
a
window
to
listen
to
the
thud
of
hoofbeats
down
the
driveway
so
ended
all
saint
eve
though
wesley
watts
mather
long
retained
his
horror
of
that
gymnasium
after
nightfall
then
for
a
time
all
moved
serenely
at
leslie
manor
thanksgiving
recess
was
drawing
nigh
and
the
girls
were
planning
for
their
holiday
which
would
begin
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
before
and
last
until
the
following
monday
morning
beverly
was
of
course
going
to
woodbine
the
boys
to
be
her
escort
from
front
royal
to
which
junction
she
would
be
duly
escorted
by
miss
stetson
in
company
with
sally
and
aileen
who
were
also
going
home
petty
gaylord
was
to
join
her
doting
mamma
in
washington
and
proceed
from
that
city
to
annapolis
to
attend
the
thanksgiving
hop
at
the
naval
academy
with
the
idol
of
her
affections
and
also
go
up
to
the
game
in
philadelphia
upon
the
saturday
following
and
petty
was
a
very
geyser
of
gurgling
giggles
at
the
prospect
beverly
five
days
at
home
with
the
boys
seemed
only
to
emphasize
the
separation
of
the
past
two
months
and
make
the
ensuing
ones
harder
to
contemplate
the
sunday
evening
before
she
must
go
back
to
school
she
was
nestling
upon
the
arm
of
the
admiral
big
chair
her
arm
about
his
neck
her
dark
head
resting
lovingly
against
his
white
one
as
she
confessed
her
sins
from
baby
days
this
had
been
a
sunday
night
custom
and
more
passed
between
these
two
in
those
twilight
hours
than
anyone
else
ever
kenned
the
admiral
study
was
one
of
those
rooms
which
seem
full
to
the
very
ceiling
of
wonderful
memories
and
was
also
one
of
the
homiest
rooms
at
woodbine
it
was
the
hour
before
tea
time
across
the
big
hall
could
be
heard
earl
queen
mellow
tenor
as
he
softly
intoned
swing
low
sweet
chariot
while
laying
the
table
for
the
evening
meal
the
little
clink
of
silver
and
glass
betraying
his
occupation
ashby
had
gone
upstairs
with
athol
to
unearth
some
treasures
he
wished
to
take
back
to
school
with
him
the
big
house
was
very
silent
a
peaceful
restful
spirit
pervading
it
upon
the
hearth
in
the
study
the
logs
blazed
brightly
filling
the
big
room
with
a
rich
red
glow
and
the
sweet
odor
of
burning
spruce
for
some
time
neither
beverly
nor
her
uncle
had
spoken
he
was
thinking
intently
of
the
confessions
just
made
as
he
gazed
at
the
darting
flames
and
absently
stroked
the
hand
she
had
slipped
into
his
her
other
one
gently
patting
his
shoulder
now
and
again
she
kissed
the
thick
silvery
curls
which
crowned
the
dear
old
head
presently
he
said
abruptly
and
now
that
you
gotten
your
load
of
sins
off
your
shoulders
and
bundled
onto
mine
do
you
feel
better
no
i
ca
say
that
i
do
but
i
had
to
unload
all
the
same
there
is
no
one
at
the
school
to
unload
upon
you
see
besides
it
could
never
be
like
you
any
way
you
always
let
things
sort
of
percolate
before
you
let
off
steam
but
it
mostly
all
steam
or
at
leslie
manor
reckon
you
can
supply
your
share
of
the
latter
ca
you
was
the
half
serious
retort
somehow
i
have
felt
exactly
since
i
been
there
it
makes
me
feel
more
steamy
as
though
i
blow
up
sometimes
it
seems
so
sort
of
of
oh
i
do
know
just
how
to
tell
you
i
to
like
miss
woodhull
but
she
freeze
a
polar
bear
and
i
believe
she
just
hates
girls
even
though
she
keeps
a
girl
school
and
miss
stetson
must
have
been
fed
on
vinegar
when
she
was
a
baby
and
miss
baylis
is
the
and
miss
forsdyke
lives
in
rome
is
anybody
just
right
asked
the
admiral
quizzically
some
of
them
would
be
all
right
if
they
had
half
a
chance
or
dared
bonnel
is
a
dear
miss
dalton
lovely
but
has
no
chance
to
prove
it
miss
powell
is
the
most
loveable
girl
you
ever
knew
and
the
little
kindergarteners
adore
her
miss
forsdyke
would
be
lovely
if
she
scared
to
death
of
miss
woodhull
and
miss
atwell
would
be
sort
of
nice
if
she
was
so
silly
oh
uncle
athol
if
you
only
see
her
pose
and
make
us
do
stunts
and
she
just
like
a
jelly
fish
all
floppy
and
i
feel
just
exactly
as
though
i
had
a
bone
in
my
body
after
two
hours
flopping
under
her
instructions
what
in
thunder
do
they
waste
time
on
such
nonsense
for
blurted
out
the
admiral
to
make
us
supple
and
graceful
am
i
stiff
uncle
athol
i
always
felt
ten
times
more
supple
after
a
rattling
good
gallop
with
ath
and
archie
or
half
a
dozen
games
of
tennis
than
after
i
turned
and
twisted
myself
into
with
miss
atwell
oh
i
miss
the
old
good
times
uncle
athol
why
ca
ath
come
to
see
me
or
i
go
to
see
him
sometimes
if
they
only
let
me
i
never
think
of
running
away
as
i
did
that
day
good
lord
how
can
i
tell
the
workings
of
an
old
maid
mind
exploded
admiral
seldon
it
too
big
a
question
for
me
to
answer
i
always
had
an
idea
that
it
was
a
good
thing
for
boys
and
girls
to
grow
up
together
and
so
has
your
mother
i
reckon
or
she
never
have
allowed
you
to
romp
with
athol
and
archie
as
long
as
you
have
and
i
for
the
life
of
me
see
that
you
any
the
worse
for
it
but
maybe
just
exactly
the
difference
between
an
old
maid
and
an
old
viewpoint
ca
you
wheedle
her
as
you
wheedle
seems
to
me
if
you
went
at
it
like
this
you
might
make
her
believe
that
the
port
and
starboard
lights
were
black
and
white
instead
of
red
and
green
try
it
miss
woodhull
uncle
athol
would
like
to
cuddle
miss
woodhull
demanded
beverly
tragically
god
bless
my
soul
no
i
as
soon
cuddle
that
statue
of
diana
yonder
on
the
lawn
so
would
was
the
prompt
reply
i
reckon
i
rather
she
half
so
cold
wheedle
hum
would
it
be
funny
if
i
could
i
think
about
it
but
if
she
were
as
cuddable
as
you
it
would
be
she
ended
with
a
bear
hug
here
queen
to
announce
tea
come
along
you
artful
huzzy
i
never
have
an
atom
of
justice
or
logic
in
me
when
i
talk
to
you
nevertheless
he
kissed
her
very
tenderly
as
he
untwined
her
circling
arms
the
past
two
months
had
been
very
lonely
ones
for
him
without
her
will
you
try
to
make
miss
woodhull
let
us
see
each
other
she
begged
i
think
about
it
i
think
about
it
and
do
you
do
some
thinking
too
lest
you
disgrace
woodbine
i
to
think
she
added
as
together
they
entered
the
cheerful
dining
room
chapter
xii
after
the
holidays
the
session
between
the
thanksgiving
and
christmas
vacation
always
seemed
a
brief
one
filled
as
it
is
with
plans
for
the
latter
holiday
when
the
thanksgiving
holiday
was
over
beverly
and
the
boys
went
back
to
their
respective
schools
under
admiral
seldon
escort
at
least
he
went
as
far
as
front
royal
with
athol
and
archie
leaving
them
at
that
point
to
go
on
by
themselves
while
he
accompanied
beverly
to
leslie
manor
he
was
minded
to
have
a
few
words
with
miss
woodhull
and
know
something
more
of
the
lady
character
than
he
already
knew
the
outcome
of
that
interview
left
a
good
deal
to
be
desired
upon
the
admiral
part
he
returned
to
woodbine
with
every
gun
silenced
and
the
lady
triumphant
in
her
convictions
that
methods
of
conducting
a
school
for
girls
were
quite
beyond
criticism
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
beverly
to
even
think
of
visiting
her
brother
at
kilton
hall
she
said
nor
could
she
consent
to
athol
visiting
leslie
manor
she
did
not
wish
to
establish
a
precedent
as
to
archie
coming
there
idea
was
preposterous
why
every
boy
for
miles
around
would
feel
at
liberty
to
call
upon
her
pupils
and
they
would
be
simply
besieged
she
had
conducted
her
school
successfully
for
many
years
under
its
present
methods
and
until
she
saw
more
cogent
reasons
for
changing
she
should
continue
to
do
so
had
not
the
admiral
made
arrangements
for
the
year
it
is
safe
to
surmise
that
beverly
would
have
returned
to
woodbine
with
him
and
his
frame
of
mind
and
the
remarks
to
which
he
gave
utterance
as
he
drove
back
to
the
junction
elicited
more
than
one
broad
grin
or
chuckle
from
andrew
jefferson
as
he
drove
but
beverly
did
not
know
anything
about
it
so
the
weeks
sped
by
until
the
christmas
recess
drew
near
and
the
girls
were
once
more
planning
to
scatter
far
and
wide
for
their
holiday
now
be
it
known
that
petty
had
returned
from
her
thanksgiving
trip
to
annapolis
in
a
more
sentimental
frame
of
mind
than
ever
and
filled
as
full
of
romance
as
an
egg
is
of
meat
each
day
brought
a
letter
always
addressed
in
a
feminine
handwriting
to
be
sure
or
there
would
have
been
little
chance
of
said
letter
ever
reaching
petty
they
were
she
confided
to
every
girl
in
the
school
under
strictest
promises
of
secrecy
for
reggy
by
darling
mamma
for
mamma
knowing
how
desperate
was
their
devotion
to
each
other
just
simply
could
not
help
acting
as
a
and
she
knew
very
well
too
that
she
petty
would
not
have
remained
at
school
a
single
day
unless
she
did
this
why
mamma
herself
had
eloped
with
papa
before
she
was
sixteen
one
whole
year
younger
than
she
herself
was
at
that
moment
was
that
romantic
where
is
papa
now
asked
beverly
she
had
never
heard
him
mentioned
oh
why
well
he
has
business
interests
which
keep
him
in
south
america
nearly
all
the
time
and
er
oh
you
need
go
into
details
it
does
make
any
difference
to
me
said
beverly
and
walked
away
with
sally
is
she
odious
and
so
perfectly
callous
to
sentiment
cried
petty
she
a
dear
and
it
a
pity
you
had
a
small
portion
of
her
common
sense
championed
aileen
emphatically
i
have
sense
enough
to
be
engaged
before
i
and
to
know
what
it
means
to
be
which
is
more
than
any
other
girl
in
this
school
can
boast
brindled
petty
well
i
should
hope
it
is
was
aileen
disgusted
retort
and
if
you
do
watch
out
you
boast
just
once
too
often
and
miss
woodhull
will
get
wise
to
your
boasting
then
there
will
be
something
stirring
unless
i
mighty
mistaken
pouf
who
cares
for
miss
woodhull
i
do
believe
she
ever
had
a
proposal
in
all
her
life
well
you
better
be
careful
was
aileen
final
warning
as
she
left
the
girls
of
which
petty
formed
the
bright
particular
star
those
three
feel
themselves
so
superior
yet
they
are
such
children
was
petty
withering
remark
aileen
was
two
months
her
junior
sally
less
than
a
year
and
beverly
exactly
fifteen
months
but
being
engaged
very
naturally
developes
and
broadens
one
views
of
life
dear
reggie
was
just
twenty
and
had
his
lady
love
but
known
that
interesting
fact
had
already
been
engaged
to
three
other
susceptible
damsels
during
his
brief
sojourn
upon
the
earth
moreover
he
was
openly
boasting
of
it
to
his
fellow
midshipmen
and
regarding
it
as
a
good
joke
oh
reggie
was
a
happily
he
was
not
a
representative
among
his
companions
most
of
them
are
gentlemen
they
can
do
a
good
bit
of
fussing
as
they
term
it
but
this
wholesale
engagement
business
is
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
nevertheless
petty
had
sang
of
the
charms
of
annapolis
until
all
her
set
were
wild
to
go
there
and
her
enthusiasm
had
spread
like
chickenpox
if
the
affairs
at
annapolis
were
all
petty
pictured
them
and
the
midshipmen
as
fascinating
the
place
must
indeed
be
a
sort
of
paradise
of
course
all
the
girls
knew
that
beverly
was
a
real
true
grandniece
that
he
had
left
annapolis
upon
his
graduation
to
take
sides
with
his
native
state
so
why
had
beverly
never
been
to
that
alluring
place
beverly
had
never
given
annapolis
a
thought
now
however
she
meant
to
know
a
few
facts
regarding
it
and
while
home
on
her
vacation
learned
a
number
she
also
learned
that
sometime
in
the
spring
during
the
easter
holiday
possibly
her
uncle
might
take
her
and
the
boys
to
washington
and
while
stopping
in
the
capital
visit
the
old
town
which
lay
adjacent
to
the
naval
academy
reservation
upon
her
return
after
the
christmas
recess
beverly
made
some
casual
allusion
to
this
fact
and
at
once
started
a
new
and
livelier
interest
why
could
a
party
of
girls
be
chaperoned
there
by
one
of
the
teachers
choosing
the
same
time
in
five
minutes
it
was
all
planned
but
they
had
miss
woodhull
to
reckon
with
and
easter
was
still
many
weeks
ahead
on
the
calendar
when
not
long
after
came
the
examinations
the
girls
had
been
working
hard
all
the
week
and
were
tired
examinations
had
ended
the
day
before
and
they
had
about
reached
the
limit
for
that
week
february
was
the
month
most
dreaded
of
all
the
eight
the
last
period
of
each
day
was
twelve
to
one
the
juniors
had
history
and
english
literature
under
miss
baylis
now
miss
baylis
at
her
very
best
was
not
a
restful
individual
with
whom
to
come
in
touch
and
after
a
long
morning
of
hard
work
and
the
growing
hunger
of
healthy
appetites
for
food
for
the
body
rather
than
for
the
mind
the
girls
did
not
find
a
barbed
tongue
and
a
caustic
disposition
soothing
english
literature
as
taught
by
miss
baylis
was
not
inspiring
to
say
the
least
and
the
half
hour
devoted
to
it
had
not
aroused
enthusiasm
then
came
the
second
half
hour
for
english
history
miss
woodhull
believing
it
well
to
take
up
the
kindred
subject
while
the
girl
minds
were
well
imbued
with
the
first
one
just
as
miss
baylis
was
about
to
begin
she
was
summoned
from
the
recitation
room
by
miss
forsdyke
take
your
books
and
refresh
your
memories
for
a
moment
or
two
i
shall
be
back
immediately
and
i
you
will
employ
this
special
privilege
in
studying
diligently
in
particular
electra
for
you
certainly
did
not
make
a
brilliant
showing
in
your
literature
recitation
remember
i
shall
expect
you
to
redeem
yourself
in
history
for
the
periods
are
identical
was
her
admonition
as
she
went
toward
the
door
as
she
was
about
to
pass
through
it
she
paused
to
repeat
her
words
sally
yawned
behind
her
book
as
the
door
closed
petty
inevitable
was
audible
the
next
second
the
door
was
hastily
opened
i
and
miss
baylis
suspicious
eyes
were
upon
her
charges
then
she
vanished
naturally
someone
else
tittered
barely
five
minutes
passed
and
when
she
returned
her
first
words
were
i
hope
then
she
paused
for
a
smile
appeared
upon
every
face
bringing
the
abstracted
lady
back
to
earth
it
was
beverly
who
asked
innocently
excuse
me
miss
baylis
but
did
you
tell
us
to
begin
our
literature
papers
at
the
line
of
pope
essay
on
man
springs
eternal
we
ended
our
literature
recitation
ten
minutes
ago
beverly
if
you
were
so
inattentive
as
to
miss
what
i
said
that
is
your
misfortune
was
the
austere
retort
nevertheless
the
shot
had
told
ten
more
minutes
of
the
period
slipped
by
nay
crawled
by
in
which
miss
baylis
darting
from
one
victim
to
another
bent
upon
reaching
their
vulnerable
points
then
it
came
electra
sanderson
turn
to
recite
now
electra
sanderson
was
distinctly
of
the
nouveau
riche
she
came
from
an
eastern
city
where
money
is
the
god
of
things
why
her
father
a
kindly
soul
who
had
risen
from
hod
carrier
to
contractor
happened
to
choose
leslie
manor
for
his
youngest
daughter
must
remain
one
of
the
unanswered
questions
perhaps
mommer
made
the
selection
on
account
of
the
name
which
had
appealed
to
her
manors
or
manners
were
all
one
to
her
at
any
rate
electra
christened
ellen
was
a
pupil
at
miss
woodhull
very
select
school
a
big
generous
dull
girl
of
seventeen
who
never
could
and
never
would
change
her
spots
but
was
inevitably
destined
to
marry
someone
of
her
own
class
rear
a
flourishing
family
and
settle
down
into
a
commonplace
matron
leslie
manor
nevertheless
and
notwithstanding
miss
woodhull
and
her
staff
might
polish
until
exhausted
the
only
result
would
be
the
removal
of
the
plating
and
the
exposure
of
the
alloy
beneath
electra
did
care
a
whoop
for
the
old
fogies
who
had
lived
and
ruled
in
england
generations
before
she
was
born
indeed
she
would
not
have
wept
had
england
and
all
the
histories
ever
written
about
her
disappeared
beneath
the
sea
which
surrounded
that
country
what
she
wanted
now
was
to
get
out
of
that
classroom
and
into
the
dining
room
visible
from
the
window
near
which
she
was
sitting
and
through
which
she
gazed
longingly
for
there
could
be
found
something
tangible
her
thoughts
had
been
in
the
dining
room
for
the
past
five
minutes
consequently
she
was
not
aware
that
sally
had
surreptitiously
reached
toward
her
from
the
seat
behind
laid
hold
of
about
eighteen
inches
of
the
lacing
of
her
peter
thomson
dangling
as
usual
and
while
petty
gaylord
sitting
next
sally
was
secretly
reading
a
letter
concealed
behind
her
book
had
made
fast
electra
peter
thomson
lacing
to
petty
boot
lacing
adrift
and
then
soberly
awaited
developments
sally
could
manage
to
do
more
things
unobserved
than
any
other
girl
in
the
school
though
she
had
found
a
fair
rival
in
beverly
thus
lay
the
train
of
things
as
they
ought
not
to
be
when
miss
baylis
fired
her
first
shot
at
poor
electra
electra
suppose
you
return
to
world
of
facts
you
seem
to
be
in
dreamland
at
present
and
tell
me
who
brought
a
rather
unpleasant
notoriety
upon
himself
at
this
period
electra
returned
to
england
and
english
affairs
at
a
bound
but
to
which
period
was
miss
baylis
referring
electra
had
not
the
ghost
of
an
idea
but
would
make
a
stab
at
it
any
way
it
man
who
made
extensive
use
of
bricks
in
the
house
of
commons
she
ventured
at
random
what
demanded
miss
baylis
utterly
bewildered
yes
i
mean
yes
miss
baylis
i
ca
remember
his
name
but
he
did
i
learned
that
by
heart
last
night
at
study
period
staunchly
asserted
electra
sure
for
once
in
her
life
of
her
point
for
had
she
those
very
words
of
repeated
miss
baylis
yes
m
miss
baylis
miss
baylis
eyes
snapped
as
much
as
any
pair
of
colorless
blue
eyes
set
too
close
together
can
snap
one
of
the
many
hopeless
tasks
which
she
had
undertaken
with
electra
had
been
to
banish
from
her
vocabulary
that
impossible
yet
like
banquo
ghost
it
refused
to
be
laid
open
your
book
at
that
page
and
read
the
sentence
commanded
the
history
teacher
electra
obediently
did
as
bidden
and
read
glibly
made
extensive
use
of
and
just
there
came
to
an
embarrassed
halt
as
a
titter
went
around
the
schoolroom
silence
miss
baylis
tone
of
voice
did
not
encourage
levity
well
she
interrogated
crisply
it
miss
baylis
said
poor
electra
covered
with
confusion
and
blushes
exactly
the
greatest
simpleton
would
understand
that
are
you
more
familiar
with
bricks
than
bribes
it
was
a
cruel
thrust
under
the
circumstances
and
miss
baylis
had
the
grace
to
blush
at
the
look
of
scorn
which
darted
from
beverly
eyes
straight
into
her
own
and
the
curl
which
aileen
lips
held
but
even
a
worm
may
turn
and
for
once
miss
baylis
was
taken
off
her
feet
by
having
electra
reply
i
guess
it
more
honest
to
be
good
came
from
someone
but
miss
baylis
thought
it
wiser
to
ignore
it
you
may
stand
and
read
that
sentence
five
times
perhaps
it
may
percolate
after
so
doing
electra
still
smarting
under
the
sting
of
miss
baylis
sarcasm
rose
hastily
and
with
her
as
hastily
rose
petty
foot
to
a
horizontal
position
encountering
in
its
ascent
the
rung
of
electra
chair
and
toppling
it
over
with
a
crash
chapter
xiii
culinary
experiments
most
of
the
girls
gave
vent
to
startled
exclamations
but
miss
baylis
was
speechless
with
rage
electra
turned
and
twisted
in
her
frantic
endeavors
to
discover
the
origin
of
the
upheaval
and
petty
made
a
mad
scramble
for
her
history
book
which
the
sudden
jerk
had
sent
flying
out
of
her
hands
the
sentimental
missive
fluttering
from
its
hiding
place
to
drop
at
beverly
feet
stooping
hastily
beverly
caught
it
up
unnoticed
in
the
greater
confusion
though
she
could
not
help
seeing
darling
little
sweetheart
in
a
large
immature
hand
at
the
heading
with
a
scarcely
repressed
laugh
she
hid
it
in
her
book
and
turned
to
face
the
storm
center
miss
baylis
who
is
responsible
for
this
folly
demanded
the
irate
one
there
was
no
reply
i
wish
an
answer
reiterated
miss
baylis
turning
to
beverly
who
sat
near
petty
is
this
your
idea
of
a
joke
not
exactly
miss
baylis
are
you
guilty
of
this
act
no
miss
baylis
do
you
know
who
is
i
could
not
tell
if
i
did
miss
baylis
i
shall
force
you
to
tell
was
the
unguarded
retort
it
is
rather
hard
to
force
an
ashby
or
a
seldon
to
do
something
they
consider
dishonorable
miss
baylis
was
the
quiet
reply
you
are
insolent
i
did
not
intend
to
be
of
this
miss
baylis
was
quite
well
aware
she
had
begun
to
understand
something
of
beverly
character
and
to
learn
something
of
the
importance
of
this
woodbine
family
and
their
standing
in
the
community
consequently
she
turned
her
attention
to
sally
and
asked
is
your
sense
of
honor
equally
nice
which
of
your
classmates
played
this
senseless
trick
sally
remained
silent
did
you
hear
my
question
i
did
miss
baylis
then
why
do
you
not
answer
me
if
you
are
aware
which
girl
did
this
silly
thing
why
do
you
keep
silent
when
you
know
i
am
sure
to
discover
sooner
or
later
perhaps
for
the
same
reason
beverly
has
answered
sally
but
why
you
ask
me
if
did
it
miss
baylis
i
often
done
far
worse
i
you
are
rarely
vulgar
in
your
pranks
was
miss
baylis
amazing
retort
which
caused
the
class
to
gasp
what
was
back
of
this
extraordinary
hedging
well
i
do
it
miss
baylis
and
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
stand
the
punishment
shall
i
go
to
miss
woodhull
office
after
class
no
i
wish
to
talk
with
you
myself
sally
looked
scornful
well
she
knew
that
miss
baylis
had
passed
her
vacation
at
kittery
point
where
uncle
tom
conant
a
bachelor
had
also
passed
his
uncle
tom
was
rich
good
looking
and
dapper
a
lady
man
who
charmed
every
member
of
the
fair
sex
with
whom
he
was
thrown
but
with
no
more
idea
of
matrimony
than
of
murder
in
his
heart
he
was
devoted
to
his
brother
children
as
well
as
the
fair
sex
in
general
and
could
no
more
help
flattering
every
one
of
them
than
he
could
help
petting
the
children
who
were
always
crowding
about
him
some
of
his
stories
of
miss
shining
up
to
him
had
nearly
convulsed
his
nieces
it
was
the
memory
of
these
which
brought
the
smile
to
sally
lips
at
the
lady
last
words
at
that
moment
the
last
bell
sounded
and
miss
baylis
was
obliged
to
dismiss
her
class
as
quickly
as
possible
miss
woodhull
was
very
intolerant
of
tardiness
at
meals
upon
the
instant
the
release
bell
sounded
the
classes
must
be
dismissed
and
each
girl
must
hurry
to
her
room
to
make
herself
presentable
at
luncheon
sally
you
will
come
to
me
after
luncheon
i
am
deeply
pained
that
you
could
be
guilty
of
such
deportment
i
wish
to
talk
seriously
with
you
was
miss
baylis
concluding
admonition
to
the
incorrigible
one
yes
miss
baylis
replied
sally
as
she
scrambled
up
her
books
and
joined
the
girls
all
hurrying
to
their
rooms
petty
lingered
to
glance
beneath
chairs
and
desks
for
the
lost
letter
to
her
dismay
it
had
vanished
completely
she
never
suspected
that
beverly
running
upstairs
with
the
others
held
it
safe
in
her
history
she
would
return
it
to
petty
later
just
at
present
she
was
too
much
amused
by
miss
baylis
attitude
toward
sally
who
had
told
her
of
some
of
the
funny
scenes
at
kittery
point
to
think
much
about
petty
love
affairs
and
before
luncheon
was
over
a
diversion
was
created
which
made
her
entirely
forget
it
for
some
time
aunt
sally
jefferson
the
cook
at
leslie
manor
had
been
ailing
and
had
recently
gone
away
to
res
up
bonnell
knew
well
enough
that
it
was
useless
to
protest
these
ups
were
periodical
usually
she
substituted
a
colored
woman
who
lived
at
luray
but
rebecca
had
taken
a
permanent
situation
and
was
not
available
jefferson
came
to
her
rescue
he
had
a
lady
frien
who
could
cook
nearly
as
well
as
his
mother
bonnell
was
skeptical
but
it
was
a
case
of
needs
must
when
the
drives
and
juno
daphne
came
as
substitute
cook
then
bonnell
trials
began
one
morning
girl
after
girl
left
her
fried
smelts
untasted
though
ordinarily
they
were
a
rare
delicacy
in
that
part
of
the
world
bonnell
investigated
what
the
trouble
had
juno
prepared
them
properly
yas
i
did
i
just
done
fry
did
you
clean
and
wash
them
carefully
persisted
bonnell
no
dey
such
triflin
fish
i
ain
see
no
sense
botherin
ter
clean
and
wash
the
next
morning
such
smelts
as
had
been
left
uncooked
for
the
previous
breakfast
came
to
the
table
a
truly
tempting
sight
but
with
the
first
mouthful
a
distinct
murmur
arose
and
bonnell
exclaimed
mercy
upon
me
has
she
done
this
time
inquiries
followed
yas
i
done
wash
dis
time
i
wash

soap
what
aunt
sally
done
made
befo
she
took
sick
and
then
for
more
than
a
week
all
went
serenely
now
dessert
was
being
brought
on
bonnell
always
served
it
wesley
came
in
from
the
pantry
bearing
a
large
platter
upon
which
rested
a
mold
of
pudding
of
the
most
amazing
color
mortal
eye
ever
rested
upon
it
was
a
vivid
beautiful
and
wesley
disclosed
every
ivory
in
his
ample
mouth
as
he
set
the
dish
upon
the
table
bonnell
had
ordered
pudding
with
chocolate
sauce
when
she
looked
upon
the
viand
before
her
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
dismay
wesley
what

de
lawd

i

i
chuckled
wesley
as
he
hurried
off
in
five
minutes
he
was
back
his
hand
across
his
mouth
and
struggling
manfully
not
to
disgrace
himself
well
queried
bonnell
her
lips
twitching
she
she
he
strove
to
articulate
she
she
say

and
wesley
beat
a
hasty
retreat
juno
daphne
departed
that
afternoon
bonnell
wishing
to
avoid
the
services
of
a
coroner
as
there
was
no
study
period
on
friday
evenings
the
girls
were
at
liberty
to
amuse
themselves
as
they
chose
at
least
within
limitations
though
they
often
miscalculated
the
limitations
the
afternoon
had
been
too
dull
and
cold
for
much
outdoor
exercise
so
they
had
spent
it
in
the
gymnasium
practicing
in
march
they
would
play
a
game
with
a
team
from
a
town
a
few
miles
from
leslie
manor
beverly
sally
and
aileen
were
all
on
the
team
beverly
having
made
it
through
adaptability
rather
than
knowledge
for
she
had
never
seen
a
basketball
before
coming
to
school
but
being
as
quick
as
a
cat
had
made
good
consequently
the
occupants
of
suite
were
glad
to
rest
their
weary
bodies
upon
couch
or
easy
chairs
when
dinner
was
over
and
sally
was
entertaining
them
with
an
account
of
her
interview
with
miss
baylis
after
luncheon
she
makes
me
tired
if
it
had
been
you
bev
she
would
have
sent
you
down
to
miss
woodhull
office
in
jig
time
but
i
a
good
one
for
uncle
tom
and
sally
laughed
i
would
have
cared
if
she
had
sent
me
i
rather
come
to
an
issue
with
the
empress
anytime
than
with
miss
baylis
but
the
whole
thing
was
funny
as
the
mischief
answered
beverly
from
her
big
wicker
chair
let
make
some
fudge
i
got
the
needfuls
and
it
will
sweeten
our
tempers
such
things
make
me
cross
for
hours
we
do
indulge
in
petty
squabbles
at
home
mother
would
be
disgusted
if
she
knew
of
some
of
the
things
which
take
place
here
and
father
would
say
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
gasoline
he
just
bought
a
new
car
so
his
metaphors
are
apt
to
be
gasoliney
laughed
aileen
what
will
you
make
the
fudge
in
you
let
hope
macleod
have
the
chafing
dish
aileen
looked
daunted
for
a
moment
then
her
face
lighted
i
a
tin
pail
i
can
make
it
in
that
but
you
ca
boil
it
without
the
lamp
ca
i
just
you
watch
me
do
it
aileen
was
resourceful
in
a
few
minutes
she
had
the
mixture
in
her
pail
and
the
pail
swinging
by
a
string
over
the
gas
jet
leslie
manor
was
quite
it
had
gas
as
well
as
electricity
though
gas
was
not
supposed
to
be
used
excepting
in
cases
of
emergency
once
or
twice
the
electric
current
had
failed
aileen
had
fastened
the
string
from
one
side
of
the
room
to
the
other
on
a
couple
of
picture
hooks
a
none
too
secure
support
then
all
three
sat
down
to
wait
until
the
fudge
gave
signs
of
boiling
and
promptly
became
absorbed
in
a
new
interest
the
easter
vacation
in
the
midst
of
the
conversation
beverly
paused
she
had
suddenly
remembered
petty
note
what
the
matter
asked
sally
i
forgotten
something
she
answered
scrambling
from
her
chair
and
crossing
to
her
desk
for
her
history
she
would
take
the
note
back
to
petty
it
was
utter
nonsense
of
course
but
it
was
petty
and
if
she
was
pleased
with
such
nonsense
she
was
welcome
to
it
she
looked
hurriedly
through
the
book
the
note
was
not
in
it
where
could
she
have
dropped
it
no
she
had
not
dropped
it
of
that
she
was
certain
she
had
taken
pains
to
keep
the
book
tightly
closed
she
meant
to
have
given
the
note
to
petty
directly
after
luncheon
how
provoking
maybe
petty
had
seen
her
catch
it
up
and
had
come
for
it
herself
she
would
go
and
ask
her
as
she
turned
to
make
her
intention
known
to
the
others
there
was
a
snap
overhead
the
heat
had
burned
aileen
string
before
the
fudge
had
begun
to
boil
and
pail
and
contents
descended
upon
the
study
table
with
a
rattle
and
splash
the
hot
mass
scattering
in
every
direction
for
the
ensuing
half
hour
the
three
girls
had
their
hands
full
and
petty
notes
history
examination
and
all
minor
affairs
were
forgotten
chapter
xiv
complications
but
petty
had
taken
the
note
from
beverly
history
it
had
been
removed
by
quite
a
different
person
in
fact
about
the
last
one
either
beverly
or
petty
would
have
dreamed
of
but
of
this
a
little
later
by
the
time
the
fudge
had
been
cleaned
off
from
everything
within
a
radius
of
five
feet
for
a
more
complete
splash
had
never
been
made
by
any
descending
mass
the
lights
out
bells
were
ringing
in
all
the
corridors
miss
woodhull
had
only
to
press
a
series
of
buttons
arranged
in
the
hall
just
outside
her
study
door
to
produce
the
effect
of
the
in
the
fairy
tale
every
inmate
immediately
dropped
asleep
every
well
exceptions
prove
a
rule
it
is
said
the
following
morning
beverly
told
petty
the
circumstances
of
picking
up
the
note
and
of
its
subsequent
disappearance
petty
was
in
despair
and
scolded
and
wept
alternately
accusing
beverly
of
having
deliberately
confiscated
it
and
hinting
pretty
broadly
that
she
had
also
read
it
the
moment
this
accusation
left
her
lips
she
regretted
it
because
she
knew
it
to
be
utterly
unfounded
and
the
blaze
which
sprung
into
eyes
warned
the
little
shallow
pate
that
she
had
ventured
a
bit
too
far
she
tried
to
retract
by
saying
she
was
nervous
and
excited
and
at
the
loss
of
the
letter
it
was
the
first
of
reggie
letters
she
had
lost
and
he
had
written
every
single
day
for
a
year
and
letters
and
every
one
mushy
cried
beverly
incredulously
i
should
think
it
would
be
worse
than
eating
a
pound
of
nougat
every
day
petty
alternately
moped
and
searched
all
saturday
but
of
course
to
no
purpose
when
monday
morning
came
she
was
in
despair
and
went
to
her
first
recitation
in
a
most
emotional
frame
of
mind
it
happened
to
be
french
and
monsieur
sautelle
had
been
the
french
instructor
but
four
months
moreover
he
had
not
yet
been
in
america
a
year
and
american
girls
and
things
american
were
not
only
new
but
a
constant
source
of
marvel
to
him
he
lived
in
a
world
of
hitherto
unknown
sensations
and
this
morning
was
destined
to
experience
an
entirely
new
one
the
period
was
nearly
over
before
it
came
petty
turn
to
recite
and
petty
as
the
result
of
having
spent
all
her
study
period
in
a
vain
search
for
the
lost
letter
was
totally
unprepared
madamoiselle
gaylor
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
come
the
conjugation
of
the
verb
love
mood
if
you
please
unfortunate
choice
petty
was
in
a
very
indicative
mood
already
had
he
chosen
any
other
verb
she
might
have
survived
the
ordeal
but
under
the
circumstances
to
openly
affirm
i
love
thou
lovest
loves
well
there
are
limits
to
every
one
endurance
under
extreme
emotion
petty
hesitated
and
was
lost
not
a
word
would
come
her
throat
throbbed
and
it
seemed
as
though
that
pound
of
nougat
beverly
had
alluded
to
must
be
stuck
in
it
proceed
if
you
please
madamoiselle
urged
monsieur
petty
sat
almost
directly
in
front
of
him
or
rather
she
stood
miss
woodhull
wished
each
pupil
to
stand
while
reciting
and
upon
being
urged
to
proceed
raised
to
him
a
pair
of
violet
eyes
swimming
in
tears
and
a
face
of
abject
woe
monsieur
sautelle
was
not
over
thirty
a
dapper
exquisite
little
man
he
was
distraught
at
the
sight
of
this
tearful
damsel
and
very
naturally
attributed
her
distress
to
unpreparedness
petty
was
a
pretty
inconsequential
little
creature
born
to
play
upon
the
feelings
of
one
man
or
another
it
did
not
much
matter
who
he
happened
to
be
so
long
as
he
could
satisfy
the
sentimental
element
in
her
makeup
and
she
was
mostly
sentimentality
madamoiselle
i
implore
why
these
tears
you
quite
desolate
me
it
is
no
such
crushing
matter
that
you
do
not
know
love
but
oh
i
do
i
sobbed
petty
then
you
will
most
kindly
demonstrate
that
fact
to
the
class
they
wait
if
ever
instructor
was
taken
literally
monsieur
sautelle
was
then
and
there
for
with
an
overpowering
sob
she
swayed
forward
flung
both
arms
about
the
dismayed
man
neck
and
burying
her
face
against
his
immaculate
collar
gurgled
oh
i
love
i
love
thou
he
he
loves
it
was
the
most
astonishing
conjugation
the
startled
professor
had
ever
heard
in
all
his
thirty
years
and
he
frantically
strove
to
remove
the
clinging
damsel
at
the
same
time
commanding
madamoiselle
madamoiselle
make
yourself
tranquil
you
will
cease
at
once
mees
woodhull
mees
stetson
mees
mees
now
it
so
happened
that
miss
stetson
recitation
room
adjoined
monsieur
sautelle
she
heard
his
call
and
responded
with
wingéd
feet
arriving
upon
the
scene
just
as
eleanor
allen
petty
bosom
friend
had
sprung
to
her
side
and
while
in
reality
striving
to
untwine
petty
clinging
arms
seemed
also
to
be
in
the
act
of
embracing
the
french
teacher
what
followed
is
almost
too
painful
to
dwell
upon
but
within
ten
minutes
all
three
actors
in
the
little
drama
were
arraigned
before
miss
woodhull
and
it
was
only
eleanor
clever
tongue
which
saved
the
situation
she
stated
very
emphatically
that
petty
had
been
too
ill
to
study
on
saturday
evening
she
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
name
the
nature
of
the
malady
that
it
had
been
impossible
for
petty
to
prepare
her
lessons
for
monday
and
that
her
act
was
purely
the
outcome
of
nervous
excitement
and
held
no
personal
demonstration
toward
professor
sautelle
this
statement
the
professor
was
more
than
delighted
to
back
up
and
petty
tears
clenched
it
miss
woodhull
could
not
endure
tears
she
had
never
shed
one
in
her
life
so
far
as
she
could
recall
and
she
wished
to
end
the
scene
forthwith
consequently
the
professor
was
politely
dismissed
and
speedily
went
to
procure
fresh
linen
under
miss
charge
petty
was
sent
to
the
infirmary
where
she
was
detained
a
week
and
eleanor
was
bidden
to
go
to
her
next
recitation
but
eleanor
who
was
petty
confidant
in
all
things
instantly
decided
to
keep
her
trump
card
to
be
played
when
the
moment
should
be
ripe
eleanor
had
missed
her
vocation
in
life
she
should
have
been
in
the
turkish
diplomatic
service
instead
of
in
an
american
boarding
school
eleanor
had
taken
the
note
from
beverly
history
she
did
so
because
having
seen
beverly
pick
it
up
and
place
it
there
she
decided
from
innate
suspicion
of
all
her
fellow
beings
that
beverly
meant
to
use
it
to
petty
undoing
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
beverly
could
entertain
a
generous
motive
toward
a
girl
whom
she
held
in
aversion
if
not
contempt
then
the
note
once
in
her
possession
she
wished
to
keep
it
a
day
or
so
in
the
hope
that
petty
might
discover
for
herself
where
it
had
gone
it
never
entered
her
head
that
beverly
would
go
straight
to
petty
and
explain
the
situation
and
in
a
reticent
freak
quite
uncommon
to
her
nature
petty
had
not
confided
this
fact
to
eleanor
and
now
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
do
so
for
the
pupils
were
not
permitted
to
visit
the
girls
in
the
infirmary
two
weeks
later
the
game
with
the
rival
school
was
imminent
and
the
team
was
working
like
mad
leslie
manor
had
been
beaten
the
year
before
and
a
second
defeat
would
spell
disgrace
eleanor
was
on
the
so
was
electra
the
captain
and
one
forward
were
seniors
aileen
center
sally
a
forward
beverly
had
made
good
as
guard
and
was
working
like
a
trojan
for
the
great
event
the
friday
afternoon
before
the
game
a
party
of
girls
were
taken
to
the
village
to
do
some
shopping
nothing
more
diverting
than
purchasing
new
shoe
ties
hairpins
bows
and
various
other
trifles
also
to
make
sure
that
the
decorations
ordered
for
the
gymnasium
would
be
punctually
sent
over
to
the
school
that
afternoon
and
last
but
by
no
means
least
to
indulge
in
chocolate
sodas
at
the
big
drug
store
it
so
happened
that
miss
forsdyke
the
latin
teacher
was
acting
as
chaperone
that
afternoon
and
miss
forsdyke
was
alive
just
exactly
two
thousand
years
after
her
time
she
should
have
lived
about
for
in
reality
she
was
living
in
that
period
right
in
the
twentieth
century
and
was
so
lost
to
all
things
modern
and
so
buried
in
all
things
ancient
that
she
was
never
quite
fully
alive
to
those
happening
all
around
her
as
a
chaperone
she
was
just
dead
easy
sally
said
a
more
creature
it
would
have
been
hard
to
come
upon
sally
aileen
and
beverly
were
lingering
over
the
last
delicious
mouthfuls
of
nut
sundaes
electra
had
finished
hers
and
gone
to
an
adjoining
counter
to
make
a
purchase
miss
forsdyke
who
had
declined
sally
invitation
to
have
a
sundae
was
selecting
a
tooth
brush
at
an
adjoining
counter
when
beverly
asked
miss
forsdyke
why
ca
we
carry
the
flags
and
ribbons
back
with
us
then
we
would
be
sure
of
them
miss
forsdyke
laid
down
the
tooth
brush
picked
it
up
again
hesitated
then
walked
toward
beverly
saying
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
miss
woodhull
would
approve
she
does
not
like
the
pupils
to
carry
parcels
large
ones
i
mean
and
these
would
be
quite
large
would
they
not
then
why
not
phone
to
her
to
ask
if
we
may
suggested
sally
could
will
you
kindly
direct
me
to
the
public
tooth
brush
she
turned
to
the
clerk
to
ask
oh
no
no
i
mean
the
public
telephone
booth
she
corrected
coloring
a
deep
pink
it
behind
you
answered
the
clerk
trying
not
to
laugh
and
pointing
to
the
booth
which
was
exactly
behind
miss
forsdyke
still
grasping
her
tooth
brush
she
scuttled
into
the
booth
naturally
electra
had
been
an
interested
listener
and
electra
mind
did
not
grasp
two
ideas
simultaneously
as
a
rule
she
had
not
yet
made
her
wants
known
to
the
clerk
who
stood
deferentially
waiting
for
her
to
do
so
as
the
possibility
seemed
vague
he
asked
politely
what
can
i
do
for
you
miss
and
nearly
disappeared
beneath
the
show
case
when
electra
answered
will
you
please
give
me
a
glass
eye
no
no
i
mean
a
glass
eye
that
no
school
it
a
blooming
lunatic
asylum
clerk
no
declared
to
clerk
no
as
the
last
pair
of
shoeheels
disappeared
through
the
door
an
the
one
the
looniest
of
them
all
nevertheless
some
of
those
lunatics
put
up
a
good
game
of
the
next
afternoon
as
the
game
progressed
the
school
and
the
spectators
were
jubilant
at
least
of
the
latter
were
and
none
more
so
than
two
girls
who
had
come
with
the
rival
team
as
all
the
leslie
manor
girls
believed
and
although
strangers
certainly
enthused
more
over
the
blue
and
yellow
the
leslie
manor
colors
than
over
the
green
and
red
look
at
those
two
stunning
girls
in
the
third
row
on
the
left
side
aileen
do
you
know
who
they
are
asked
sally
during
one
of
the
intermissions
never
laid
eyes
on
them
before
replied
aileen
is
the
tall
fair
one
beautiful
though
i
never
seen
such
eyes
and
skin
in
all
my
life
she
knows
how
to
dress
too
believe
me
was
sally
admiring
comment
that
a
stunning
velveteen
suit
she
has
on
and
her
hat
well
new
york
or
paris
sure
the
smaller
one
must
be
attractive
too
but
is
it
funny
that
she
should
wear
her
chiffon
veil
under
her
lace
one
instead
of
outside
of
it
i
wish
she
raise
them
properly
i
want
to
get
a
good
look
at
her
face
somehow
she
reminds
me
of
someone
i
met
before
but
i
ca
think
of
whom
we
ask
beverly
but
just
then
the
whistle
blew
and
the
game
was
on
again
when
leslie
manor
won
on
a
score
of
twenty
to
seven
the
girl
in
the
chiffon
veil
jumped
to
her
feet
pitched
her
muff
high
into
the
air
and
yelled
then
evidently
overwhelmed
with
mortification
at
her
wild
demonstration
instantly
dropped
back
upon
her
chair
aided
in
her
descent
thereto
by
a
vigorous
tug
from
her
companion
at
beverly
grasping
oh
aileen
and
sally
started
beverly
had
not
noticed
the
two
girls
until
that
instant
what
the
matter
asked
sally
nothing
just
a
funny
kink
in
my
side
it
all
over
now
you
played
too
hard
i
knew
you
would
come
quick
and
get
a
good
you
nearly
all
in
why
did
we
realize
it
sooner
come
on
and
full
of
solicitude
they
hurried
her
away
to
the
her
supposed
indisposition
driving
all
thoughts
of
the
strange
girls
from
their
heads
and
when
the
three
were
dressed
and
ready
to
join
their
companions
the
visitors
had
disappeared
gone
undoubtedly
with
others
who
had
come
to
witness
the
game
and
they
never
thought
to
mention
their
presence
to
beverly
that
they
in
common
with
the
other
guests
had
been
ushered
into
miss
woodhull
library
where
agreeable
to
custom
hot
chocolate
was
served
had
each
by
some
miraculous
means
contrived
to
be
served
and
had
held
a
brief
but
most
flattering
conversation
with
miss
woodhull
sally
beverly
and
aileen
never
suspected
when
they
took
their
departure
miss
woodhull
suddenly
remembered
that
they
had
not
been
introduced
to
her
and
that
she
had
not
the
vaguest
idea
of
their
names
which
of
her
teachers
or
pupils
had
been
so
very
remiss
chapter
xv
the
trump
card
it
so
happened
that
the
presence
of
the
two
strange
girls
had
aroused
the
curiosity
of
someone
else
and
that
this
somebody
being
of
a
suspicious
nature
at
all
times
required
but
little
to
set
her
fancies
she
had
watched
the
girls
all
through
the
game
and
at
its
end
sped
away
to
the
dressing
room
and
changed
her
clothes
with
remarkable
expedition
then
instead
of
joining
her
companions
in
miss
woodhull
reception
room
where
tea
was
to
be
served
to
pupils
and
guests
she
hurried
into
her
outdoor
garments
and
slipped
out
of
a
side
door
made
her
way
around
the
house
to
a
clump
of
fir
trees
in
which
she
could
watch
undetected
all
who
left
the
main
entrance
of
leslie
manor
she
did
not
have
to
wait
long
the
two
girls
were
among
the
first
to
leave
but
instead
of
following
the
broad
main
walk
as
the
other
guests
did
they
turned
into
a
side
path
as
though
wishing
to
stroll
about
the
grounds
the
moment
they
were
out
of
sight
the
suspicious
one
was
upon
their
trail
and
miss
eleanor
allen
was
compelled
to
do
some
lively
stepping
out
in
order
to
overtake
her
quarry
only
they
were
certainly
most
athletic
young
women
if
one
might
judge
from
the
manner
in
which
they
strode
forward
naturally
at
that
season
of
the
year
the
outskirts
of
the
grounds
were
entirely
deserted
the
elegantly
dressed
young
ladies
hurried
toward
a
dense
clump
of
cedars
which
grew
near
the
prickly
holly
hedge
and
to
eleanor
amazement
the
wearer
of
the
big
chiffon
veil
began
to
tug
and
haul
at
it
until
it
came
loose
while
the
taller
girl
began
to
divest
herself
of
her
handsome
fur
collar
and
coat
eleanor
gasped
and
the
next
moment
nearly
passed
away
for
now
miss
skirts
fell
from
her
and
miss
began
to
wriggle
out
of
garments
as
a
boy
might
wriggle
out
of
his
coat
and
vest
it
was
all
eleanor
could
do
to
repress
a
cry
of
horror
then
off
fell
the
big
hat
the
hair
coming
with
it
and
before
her
stood
a
tall
fair
boy
in
his
trousers
and
shirt
gee
whiz
ath
pitch
me
my
coat
quick
those
girl
togs
nearly
smothered
me
and
now
i
freezing
he
cried
the
garments
desired
were
picked
out
of
a
bundle
of
things
hidden
in
the
cedars
and
flung
at
the
shivering
blonde
who
promptly
scrambled
into
it
and
drew
from
one
of
the
pockets
a
cap
which
he
jammed
down
upon
his
curly
pate
then
swooping
down
he
caught
up
the
feminine
gear
lying
upon
the
ground
jammed
it
pell
mell
into
a
laundry
bag
and
heaved
it
over
the
hedge
into
the
road
beyond
his
companion
now
having
cast
his
outer
raiment
doing
precisely
the
same
thing
then
both
shinned
up
a
tall
tree
whose
branches
overhung
the
road
walked
like
along
a
branch
which
topped
the
hedge
and
dropped
lightly
to
the
ground
eleanor
ran
to
the
hedge
in
time
to
see
the
laundry
bags
pitched
upon
the
backs
of
two
waiting
horses
the
boys
scramble
upon
their
mounts
and
with
a
whoop
of
triumph
go
pelting
off
down
the
road
well
i
never
well
i
never
gasped
miss
paulina
pry
which
was
unquestionably
the
absolute
truth
though
not
characteristic
that
was
beverly
ashby
brother
and
her
beau
eleanor
selection
of
common
nouns
was
at
times
decidedly
common
now
miss
we
will
see
what
happens
to
girls
who
are
so
very
superior
to
other
girls
but
can
read
their
letters
and
sneak
boys
into
our
school
against
rules
and
back
she
sped
to
the
house
filled
to
the
brim
with
knowledge
but
with
such
a
paucity
of
wisdom
in
her
brain
that
it
was
a
wonder
she
kept
to
the
path
it
was
a
pity
that
no
one
was
at
hand
to
quote
for
her
benefit
knowledge
is
haughty
that
she
knows
so
much
but
wisdom
is
humble
that
she
knows
no
more
from
the
moment
eleanor
allen
entered
leslie
manor
she
had
been
petty
gaylord
slave
and
a
more
complete
crush
never
was
known
flowers
candy
books
and
what
not
were
lavished
upon
her
adored
one
everything
that
petty
would
accept
and
since
petty
discrimination
was
not
of
the
nicest
order
all
proved
fish
which
fell
into
her
net
eleanor
lived
in
the
atmosphere
of
petty
thrilling
romance
until
she
almost
felt
it
to
be
her
own
she
had
seen
the
lost
letter
flutter
to
the
schoolroom
floor
and
had
also
seen
beverly
pick
it
up
her
first
impulse
was
to
run
and
tell
petty
but
had
no
opportunity
to
do
so
in
the
classroom
then
she
decided
to
effect
its
rescue
herself
and
while
the
others
were
at
luncheon
had
slipped
into
beverly
room
and
extracted
the
note
from
her
history
she
never
dreamed
that
beverly
meant
to
return
it
to
petty
and
did
not
know
that
she
had
gone
to
her
the
following
morning
to
explain
its
loss
as
well
as
she
was
able
eleanor
intended
to
give
petty
the
note
at
once
but
when
circumstances
had
prevented
her
from
doing
so
for
several
hours
she
made
up
her
mind
to
keep
it
in
her
own
possession
in
order
to
use
it
to
beverly
undoing
just
how
this
was
to
be
compassed
she
had
no
very
clear
idea
and
had
come
a
fine
opening
she
hated
beverly
because
she
had
laughed
at
petty
love
affair
and
ignored
completely
the
one
who
worshipped
at
petty
shrine
the
scene
in
professor
sautelle
room
had
nearly
thrown
beverly
into
hysterics
and
eleanor
had
also
witnessed
that
oh
she
had
a
long
score
against
beverly
ashby
that
evening
as
miss
woodhull
sat
by
her
study
table
reading
a
tap
came
upon
her
door
and
eleanor
entered
at
the
word
come
miss
woodhull
was
not
at
being
interrupted
in
the
midst
of
a
thrilling
article
on
the
suffrage
question
and
the
militant
doings
of
her
wronged
sisters
in
england
well
she
queried
crisply
i
would
like
to
speak
to
you
miss
woodhull
very
well
speak
was
the
terse
reply
this
was
somewhat
disconcerting
eleanor
coughed
will
you
be
good
enough
to
state
your
errand
without
further
peroration
i
do
not
relish
being
interrupted
in
my
reading
i
i
thought
i
ought
to
tell
you
to
show
you
i
mean
you
ought
to
see
this
note
which
i
found
and
eleanor
crossed
the
room
to
miss
side
the
note
held
toward
her
she
took
it
asking
as
she
did
so
why
come
to
me
about
so
trivial
a
matter
what
is
it
where
did
you
find
it
i
did
think
it
trivial
and
that
is
why
i
came
right
to
you
eleanor
replied
ignoring
the
embarrassing
questions
miss
woodhull
opened
the
note
the
first
line
acted
like
a
galvanic
shock
she
sat
up
rigid
as
a
lamp
post
the
words
were
darling
little
sweetheart
then
she
read
on
when
i
close
my
eyes
i
can
still
feel
your
soft
arms
about
my
neck
and
your
kisses
upon
my
lips
i
ca
wait
much
longer
for
you
darling
something
must
be
done
i
just
ca
stand
it
i
got
to
see
you
before
easter
it
no
use
to
say
i
ca
because
i
going
to
somehow
so
do
be
surprised
at
anything
leslie
manor
is
not
so
many
miles
away
and
ways
and
means
can
be
contrived
in
spite
of
all
the
old
maid
guardians
that
ever
lived
wonder
if
the
old
lady
knows
how
it
feels
to
have
a
man
kiss
her
i
bet
she
do
i
never
seen
your
suffragette
queen
but
i
do
need
to
after
all
you
told
me
about
her
she
must
be
a
cuckoo
so
keep
your
weather
eye
piped
sweetness
and
leave
the
rest
to
your
adoring
by
the
time
the
empress
reached
the
last
word
of
that
missive
her
face
had
assumed
the
color
of
a
gobbler
wattles
and
her
eyes
were
blazing
eleanor
was
nearly
frightened
to
death
at
the
genius
of
wrath
which
she
had
invoked
to
whom
does
this
nauseating
thing
belong
it
was
not
in
an
envelope
when
i
found
it
miss
woodhull
where
did
you
find
it
eleanor
hesitated
it
would
never
do
to
seem
too
communicative
did
you
understand
my
question
yes
miss
woodhull
then
reply
at
once
i
found
it
in
the
south
wing
she
said
hesitatingly
ah
the
word
was
exhaled
triumphantly
in
the
lower
end
of
that
wing
yes
miss
woodhull
near
suite
she
recalled
the
tall
acrobatic
visitor
of
all
saints
eve
she
had
always
suspected
beverly
and
her
suspicions
had
been
confirmed
when
admiral
ashby
asked
her
to
sanction
visits
from
athol
and
archie
you
did
quite
right
to
come
to
me
with
this
letter
it
is
far
too
serious
a
matter
to
be
dealt
with
by
my
subordinates
i
highly
commend
your
discretion
i
shall
sift
the
matter
to
the
bottom
eleanor
winced
that
sifting
might
change
from
a
small
affair
to
a
large
one
as
a
snowball
may
grow
into
an
avalanche
then
she
said
with
contrition
oh
miss
woodhull
i
would
not
for
the
world
accuse
it
may
be
just
fun
there
is
no
element
of
fun
in
such
a
letter
as
this
and
absolutely
no
humor
i
have
realized
for
some
time
that
a
decided
atmosphere
was
being
created
in
this
school
but
have
been
unable
to
discover
its
origin
and
giving
the
letter
the
vicious
shake
a
terrier
would
give
a
rat
may
prove
the
touchstone
i
need
hardly
enjoin
absolute
secrecy
upon
your
part
you
have
already
proved
your
discretion
if
you
make
any
further
discoveries
you
will
of
course
come
to
me
at
once
when
did
you
find
the
letter
why
er
several
days
ago
miss
woodhull
then
why
have
you
so
long
delayed
coming
to
me
the
eyes
were
very
searching
i
was
afraid
afraid
i
might
be
mistaken
that
after
all
it
really
did
mean
anything
the
girls
often
play
jokes
upon
one
another
you
know
not
such
senseless
jokes
as
this
one
i
trust
what
caused
you
to
alter
your
opinion
the
professional
stage
certainly
missed
a
star
when
it
failed
to
discover
eleanor
she
hesitated
looked
down
then
up
with
appealing
eyes
she
twisted
her
fingers
together
and
untwisted
them
she
shifted
from
one
foot
to
the
other
all
of
which
was
maddeningly
irritating
to
miss
woodhull
this
is
no
time
for
hesitation
speak
this
afternoon
whispered
eleanor
sit
in
that
chair
and
tell
me
everything
without
further
circumlocution
the
tone
was
final
with
appropriate
hesitancy
the
events
of
the
afternoon
were
graphically
pictured
for
the
empress
when
they
were
completely
drawn
she
said
with
the
grimness
of
fate
you
may
go
but
remember
not
one
word
to
your
companions
a
most
superfluous
admonition
for
eleanor
was
nearly
petrified
with
fear
as
it
was
she
retreated
to
her
room
with
all
possible
speed
and
her
wondered
what
had
taken
place
to
make
her
look
so
pale
but
refrained
from
asking
questions
eleanor
and
her
were
not
entirely
congenial
it
was
close
to
when
she
entered
her
room
which
was
on
the
floor
above
beverly
down
in
hospitable
suite
the
social
spirit
was
rampant
the
victory
was
being
celebrated
by
a
spread
light
bell
did
not
ring
until
ten
saturday
nights
beverly
was
in
the
act
of
biting
into
a
chocolate
eclair
when
miss
stetson
came
to
the
door
beverly
was
sitting
back
to
it
and
supposed
it
was
one
of
her
companions
as
all
will
concede
an
eclair
is
to
say
the
least
an
uncertain
quantity
even
upon
a
plate
and
carefully
manipulated
with
a
fork
it
is
given
to
erratic
performances
when
held
between
a
thumb
and
forefinger
and
into
its
possibilities
are
beyond
conjecture
miss
stetson
appeared
at
a
most
inopportune
moment
she
usually
did
and
each
girl
rose
to
her
feet
beverly
under
the
circumstances
being
the
last
to
do
so
because
she
had
no
idea
that
miss
stetson
was
anywhere
near
no
her
tardy
uprising
brought
about
the
inevitable
result
her
teeth
came
together
upon
her
eclair
and
the
filling
escaped
its
bounds
landing
in
many
places
that
it
should
not
have
landed
when
miss
stetson
had
removed
about
a
tablespoonful
of
cream
filling
from
her
bosom
she
said
icily
miss
ashby
you
are
to
report
at
miss
woodhull
study
at
once
and
utterly
ignored
beverly
apologies
report
at
miss
woodhull
office
at
at
night
consternation
fell
upon
the
revellers
the
hair
had
snapped
and
sword
had
certainly
fallen
chapter
xvi
a
crisis
fully
as
bewildered
as
the
girls
she
had
left
behind
her
beverly
went
quickly
to
miss
woodhull
study
so
far
as
she
could
recollect
nothing
could
be
scored
against
her
deportment
unless
at
this
late
date
her
wild
gallop
to
kilton
hall
had
become
known
or
the
presence
of
athol
and
archie
at
the
frolic
had
been
discovered
true
she
had
recognized
athol
and
his
companion
as
they
were
leaving
the
gymnasium
that
afternoon
but
she
did
not
believe
that
any
one
else
had
as
to
any
foreknowledge
of
that
prank
she
had
not
had
the
slightest
so
her
conscience
was
quite
clear
on
that
score
anyway
she
tapped
at
the
door
and
was
bidden
enter
miss
woodhull
expression
as
she
looked
at
beverly
was
most
forbidding
miss
woodhull
miss
stetson
said
you
wished
to
see
me
utterly
ignoring
the
greeting
miss
woodhull
thrust
toward
beverly
the
incriminating
letter
at
the
same
time
demanding
who
has
had
the
audacity
to
send
such
a
thing
as
this
to
you
while
you
are
a
pupil
in
my
school
beverly
started
at
sight
of
the
lost
love
billet
miss
woodhull
noted
the
start
and
a
sneer
curved
her
set
lips
no
one
sent
it
to
me
miss
woodhull
she
answered
calmly
you
will
probably
add
that
you
have
never
seen
it
before
beverly
did
not
reply
answer
me
at
once
yes
i
have
seen
it
before
where
did
you
last
see
it
in
my
english
history
book
how
came
it
there
pray
i
put
it
there
myself
and
yet
you
have
the
temerity
to
tell
me
that
it
is
not
yours
are
you
in
the
habit
of
reading
letters
which
are
addressed
to
other
people
was
the
letter
addressed
miss
woodhull
it
was
not
even
in
an
envelope
when
it
came
into
my
possession
you
have
no
doubt
destroyed
the
envelope
nevertheless
i
must
insist
upon
knowing
who
wrote
that
letter
i
can
not
tell
you
miss
woodhull
i
have
never
looked
at
the
signature
how
dare
you
resort
to
such
fencing
with
me
you
can
not
evade
a
direct
answer
for
i
have
resolved
to
learn
the
writer
name
and
report
him
to
the
principal
of
his
school
asserted
miss
woodhull
jumping
at
conclusions
i
can
not
tell
you
the
writer
name
you
mean
that
you
not
but
i
warn
you
this
obstinacy
only
adds
to
the
gravity
of
the
situation
it
is
not
obstinacy
miss
woodhull
i
do
not
know
it
yet
you
admit
having
had
this
open
letter
in
your
possession
and
insist
that
it
is
not
your
own
a
curious
combination
to
say
the
least
was
the
sarcastic
retort
i
had
the
letter
but
it
is
not
mine
i
never
read
it
and
i
do
not
know
the
writer
name
this
was
entirely
true
beverly
had
never
heard
dear
reggie
surname
perhaps
you
are
likewise
ignorant
of
the
identity
of
the
two
people
who
masqueraded
as
and
jack
o
lantern
they
were
my
brother
and
his
friend
archie
was
the
prompt
reply
ah
then
you
will
admit
something
of
this
intrigue
if
it
can
be
called
by
so
portentious
a
name
answered
beverly
smiling
that
smile
acted
like
a
match
to
gunpowder
miss
woodhull
temper
and
vanished
together
and
for
a
few
moments
beverly
was
the
object
of
a
scathing
volley
of
sarcastic
invective
as
it
waxed
hotter
and
hotter
beverly
grew
colder
and
colder
though
her
eyes
and
cheeks
were
blazing
it
is
useless
to
keep
up
this
silly
deception
you
may
as
well
try
to
make
me
believe
that
you
were
not
aware
of
the
presence
of
your
brother
and
your
silly
sweetheart
disguised
as
girls
this
afternoon
and
that
you
did
not
lay
the
whole
disgraceful
plan
for
them
to
escape
at
the
rear
of
the
grounds
miss
woodhull
did
not
confide
to
beverly
that
she
had
been
most
beautifully
hoodwinked
by
those
same
girls
who
had
actually
gone
into
the
reception
room
partaken
of
the
eats
with
the
other
guests
held
charmingly
lisping
conversations
with
two
or
three
of
the
faculty
miss
woodhull
included
who
had
afterward
commented
upon
the
charming
manners
of
the
two
young
girls
who
had
come
from
luray
they
having
so
informed
that
lady
sweetheart
repeated
beverly
in
amazement
it
was
the
one
word
which
burned
itself
into
her
brain
the
tone
in
which
she
echoed
it
ought
to
have
enlightened
miss
woodhull
archie
my
sweetheart
i
dare
say
that
is
what
you
call
him
since
he
so
terms
you
in
this
missive
sneered
miss
woodhull
archie
is
like
an
older
brother
to
me
miss
woodhull
we
were
raised
together
said
beverly
with
a
simple
dignity
which
should
have
prohibited
further
taunts
of
the
kind
raised
queried
the
lady
do
you
class
yourself
with
the
vegetable
or
the
lower
animal
kingdom
i
think
you
must
have
heard
that
expression
used
before
in
virginia
was
the
quiet
reply
though
her
cheeks
grew
a
deeper
red
and
had
ashby
been
present
and
occupying
the
tribunal
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
she
would
have
been
prepared
for
something
to
happen
right
speedily
indeed
it
was
a
wonder
something
had
not
happened
long
ago
it
is
just
such
barbarisms
of
speech
that
i
have
spent
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
a
vain
endeavor
to
eliminate
from
the
extraordinary
vocabulary
of
this
section
of
the
united
states
but
i
recognize
it
to
be
a
sisyphus
task
that
however
is
aside
the
question
the
vital
ones
at
this
moment
are
by
whom
was
this
letter
written
when
did
you
receive
it
what
is
the
meaning
of
its
contents
and
how
you
could
have
had
the
audacity
to
hold
clandestine
meetings
with
this
young
man
also
how
many
times
he
has
actually
forced
himself
into
my
school
disguised
as
a
girl
in
a
slow
even
voice
beverly
replied
to
each
question
i
do
not
know
the
name
of
the
person
who
wrote
that
letter
i
never
received
it
i
can
not
tell
you
the
meaning
of
the
contents
because
i
do
not
know
them
i
have
never
held
any
clandestine
meetings
with
athol
or
archie
and
so
far
as
i
knew
until
after
the
game
today
they
had
been
in
this
school
but
once
at
that
time
i
knew
they
were
coming
and
we
did
it
partly
for
a
lark
and
partly
because
i
wanted
so
terribly
to
see
athol
a
little
catch
came
into
her
voice
just
there
miss
woodhull
wholly
misinterpreted
the
reason
for
it
and
murmured
sarcastically
athol
yes
my
twin
brother
miss
woodhull
i
do
not
expect
to
understand
what
we
have
always
been
to
each
other
as
to
their
presence
here
this
afternoon
i
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
it
until
athol
pitched
his
muff
into
the
air
and
gave
our
old
yell
of
victory
at
the
end
of
the
game
and
beverly
nearly
laughed
at
the
recollection
of
her
start
when
the
old
familiar
sound
fell
upon
her
ears
and
the
memory
of
the
way
in
which
that
muff
had
hurtled
into
the
air
your
mirth
is
most
miss
ashby
this
is
by
no
means
a
facetious
occasion
please
understand
i
do
not
lightly
tolerate
the
infringement
of
my
rules
as
you
will
learn
to
your
cost
if
as
you
state
you
are
ignorant
of
the
contents
of
this
letter
you
may
now
read
it
aloud
in
my
presence
perhaps
that
may
refresh
your
memory
and
enable
you
to
answer
the
other
questions
miss
woodhull
held
the
letter
toward
beverly
the
girl
did
not
stir
did
you
understand
my
command
i
did
miss
woodhull
i
have
already
told
you
the
entire
truth
but
i
must
decline
to
read
that
letter
because
it
is
not
mine
decline
decline
almost
shrieked
the
infuriated
principal
do
you
dare
defy
my
commands
i
do
not
wish
to
defy
your
orders
miss
woodhull
but
i
can
not
read
someone
else
letter
beverly
voice
was
trembling
partly
from
nervousness
partly
from
outraged
pride
you
shall
read
that
letter
to
me
whether
it
is
yours
or
not
though
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
it
is
yours
and
that
you
are
trying
to
shield
yourself
behind
some
purely
fictitious
person
you
seem
to
possess
a
lively
imagination
beverly
stood
rigid
miss
woodhull
waited
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
give
a
name
to
your
fictitious
being
i
do
know
to
whom
that
letter
was
sent
for
i
saw
her
drop
it
i
picked
it
up
to
return
it
to
her
but
before
i
could
do
so
it
disappeared
from
my
history
i
could
not
help
reading
the
first
line
because
it
stood
out
so
plainly
before
me
when
i
picked
the
letter
from
the
floor
i
know
nothing
further
of
its
contents
and
i
do
not
wish
to
that
line
was
silly
enough
the
girl
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
it
until
i
went
to
her
later
and
told
her
about
finding
it
and
also
about
its
loss
afterward
from
that
moment
to
this
i
have
never
laid
eyes
upon
it
and
i
wish
i
never
had
seen
it
at
all
you
may
believe
me
or
not
as
you
choose
but
until
i
came
into
this
school
such
things
had
never
entered
my
head
and
mother
and
uncle
athol
would
be
perfectly
disgusted
with
the
whole
showdown
and
so
am
i
beverly
paused
for
want
of
breath
who
dropped
that
letter
the
words
were
in
italics
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
some
vague
doubts
were
beginning
to
form
in
the
back
of
the
principal
brain
do
you
for
one
second
think
that
i
will
tell
you
blazed
beverly
i
am
very
positive
that
you
will
tell
me
without
a
moment
delay
or
you
will
be
suspended
from
this
school
within
hours
if
not
expelled
her
name
at
once
i
shall
never
tell
you
no
matter
what
you
do
to
me
what
do
you
take
me
for
how
you
think
me
capable
of
such
a
mucker
trick
unconsciously
she
had
lapsed
into
athol
vernacular
it
was
the
last
touch
to
miss
woodhull
wrath
she
actually
flew
up
out
of
her
chair
and
catching
beverly
by
her
shoulders
shook
her
soundly
then
it
all
happened
in
a
flash
miss
woodhull
was
a
tall
woman
and
a
large
woman
as
well
she
weighed
at
least
pounds
but
from
lack
of
proper
exercise
she
loathed
walking
and
the
enjoyment
of
the
many
luxuries
which
the
past
successful
years
had
made
possible
she
was
exactly
like
a
india
rubber
figure
beverly
was
tall
for
a
girl
not
yet
sixteen
and
as
the
result
of
having
grown
up
with
two
active
healthy
boys
and
having
done
every
earthly
thing
which
they
had
done
she
was
a
living
vital
bunch
of
energy
and
muscles
and
fully
as
strong
as
athol
never
since
tiny
childhood
when
mammy
riah
had
smacked
her
for
some
misdeed
or
her
mother
had
spanked
her
for
some
real
transgression
had
hand
been
laid
upon
her
excepting
in
a
caress
that
any
human
being
could
so
lose
her
as
to
resort
to
such
methods
of
correction
she
would
not
have
believed
possible
then
in
a
flash
all
the
fighting
blood
of
the
ashbys
and
seldons
boiled
and
with
a
cry
of
outraged
feelings
beverly
ashby
laid
hold
of
miss
woodhull
flabby
arms
with
a
pair
of
slender
muscular
hands
backed
her
by
main
force
against
the
chair
which
she
had
so
hastily
vacated
and
plumped
that
dumbfounded
lady
down
upon
it
with
a
force
which
made
her
teeth
crack
together
as
she
cried
indignantly
how
dare
you
touch
me
how
dare
you
then
with
a
whirl
she
was
across
the
room
out
of
the
door
and
up
the
stairs
to
study
which
she
entered
like
a
cyclone
and
rushed
across
into
her
bedroom
slamming
and
locking
the
door
what
mental
processes
took
place
behind
that
locked
door
her
astonished
who
had
been
eagerly
awaiting
her
return
could
not
even
guess
and
dared
not
venture
to
inquire
not
a
sound
came
from
the
room
what
do
you
suppose
has
happened
asked
sally
breathlessly
something
a
good
deal
more
serious
than
we
have
any
idea
of
beverly
ashby
is
not
the
kind
of
girl
to
look
or
act
like
that
without
a
mighty
good
cause
did
you
notice
her
face
it
frightened
me
was
aileen
awed
reply
what
can
we
do
asked
sally
in
deep
distress
not
one
single
solitary
thing
and
that
the
very
worst
of
it
we
do
even
know
what
has
happened
and
the
two
girls
began
to
prepare
for
bed
in
a
bewildered
sort
of
way
meanwhile
down
in
that
perfectly
appointed
study
a
very
dazed
woman
sat
rigid
and
silent
for
the
very
first
time
in
all
her
life
she
had
encountered
a
will
stronger
than
her
own
had
met
in
the
person
of
an
individual
only
a
quarter
of
her
own
age
a
force
which
had
literally
and
figuratively
swept
her
off
her
feet
and
set
at
naught
a
resolution
which
she
believed
to
be
indomitable
and
worst
of
all
it
had
all
come
to
pass
because
she
had
lost
her
up
to
her
own
outbreak
miss
woodhull
was
forced
to
admit
that
beverly
had
been
absolutely
courteous
it
was
purely
her
own
act
which
had
precipitated
that
climax
for
fully
half
an
hour
she
sat
as
one
stunned
then
she
said
and
the
words
almost
hissed
from
her
colorless
lips
i
shall
make
an
example
of
her
she
shall
be
expelled
in
disgrace
though
then
and
there
she
resolved
that
none
should
ever
learn
of
that
final
scene
and
well
somehow
though
she
could
not
explain
her
conviction
she
knew
that
the
outside
world
would
never
learn
of
it
through
beverly
chapter
xvii
in
the
wee
sma
hours
when
beverly
swept
into
her
room
her
thoughts
were
like
a
seething
cauldron
one
instant
one
impression
boiled
to
the
surface
only
to
be
submerged
the
very
next
by
others
surging
to
the
top
she
could
not
think
connectedly
everything
seemed
jumbled
pell
mell
in
her
brains
just
one
incident
took
definite
shape
she
had
been
shaken
like
a
naughty
child
and
told
that
she
was
lying
and
all
because
every
instinct
of
honor
and
justice
forbade
her
betraying
a
even
though
she
entertained
for
her
little
less
than
contempt
and
the
effect
of
miss
woodhull
act
was
very
much
as
though
a
man
had
deliberately
walked
up
to
admiral
seldon
accused
him
of
lying
and
slapped
his
face
during
the
six
months
which
she
had
spent
at
leslie
manor
beverly
ashby
had
been
no
more
nor
less
than
just
herself
neither
better
nor
worse
than
the
average
girl
but
for
her
six
months
in
a
presided
over
by
a
woman
who
had
never
known
any
real
girlhood
or
girlhood
exuberance
was
an
experience
far
different
than
for
the
average
girl
miss
woodhull
had
grown
more
and
more
iconoclastic
and
more
of
a
law
unto
herself
with
each
advancing
year
she
had
become
as
adamant
to
all
natural
impulses
and
apparently
dead
to
all
affection
bitterly
intolerant
of
suggestion
advice
or
even
the
natural
laws
of
ethics
with
each
year
she
had
grown
more
difficult
to
live
with
and
less
and
less
fitted
to
govern
growing
girls
but
in
the
beginning
the
school
had
established
a
reputation
for
the
thoroughness
of
its
curriculum
and
its
instruction
as
well
as
for
its
discipline
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
some
of
the
girls
which
had
come
to
it
during
the
past
thirty
years
were
in
need
of
some
discipline
but
beverly
ashby
was
not
of
the
type
who
required
discipline
of
the
order
miss
woodhull
believed
in
beverly
had
lived
for
more
than
fifteen
years
under
the
discipline
of
love
and
good
judgement
and
had
developed
fairly
well
in
that
atmosphere
her
mother
had
never
reproved
or
punished
her
in
anger
the
admiral
while
adoring
her
was
boss
of
the
ship
and
both
she
and
athol
had
always
recognized
that
fact
his
word
was
law
moreover
she
had
always
been
treated
as
a
reasoning
human
being
trusted
a
nice
code
of
honor
having
been
established
from
the
moment
the
twins
could
understand
the
meaning
of
that
fine
old
word
and
that
is
much
earlier
in
children
lives
than
a
good
many
grownups
believe
no
wonder
an
outraged
little
mortal
now
sat
at
her
window
her
heart
beating
tattoo
her
temples
throbbing
her
cheeks
blazing
her
eyes
flashing
but
her
hands
clenched
and
icy
cold
there
she
sat
until
all
sounds
in
the
big
house
were
hushed
she
was
as
rigid
as
though
carved
from
marble
even
though
her
breath
came
and
went
pantingly
the
hand
upon
the
clock
in
the
stable
tower
crept
from
hour
to
hour
the
bell
telling
off
the
she
neither
saw
nor
heard
then
came
the
twelve
long
deliberate
strokes
announcing
the
witching
hour
at
the
first
stroke
beverly
started
into
life
by
the
time
the
last
had
sounded
the
pretty
pink
dinner
gown
she
had
been
wearing
lay
in
a
tumbled
heap
upon
the
bed
where
she
had
tossed
it
by
this
time
the
moon
which
had
been
pouring
its
flood
of
light
into
her
room
was
dropping
behind
the
tall
trees
and
the
room
was
growing
dark
the
steam
heat
had
long
since
died
down
and
the
room
was
cold
she
was
entirely
unconscious
of
physical
conditions
silently
as
a
shadow
she
worked
and
with
the
swiftness
of
a
cloud
scudding
before
a
gale
of
wind
in
ten
minutes
the
room
was
in
perfect
order
and
she
was
garbed
in
her
stout
heavy
riding
skirt
a
warm
flannel
shirt
waist
and
heavy
sweater
her
wool
skating
cap
was
pulled
tight
down
about
her
ears
and
she
carried
her
riding
crop
in
her
gloved
hands
gently
raising
her
window
she
slipped
out
upon
the
piazza
roof
crawled
upon
her
hands
and
knees
to
the
edge
tossed
her
riding
crop
to
the
ground
and
then
slid
down
the
piazza
pillar
as
easily
as
athol
could
have
done
it
picking
up
the
riding
crop
she
sped
across
the
lawn
to
the
stable
well
hidden
by
the
foliage
andrew
jackson
jefferson
and
his
two
assistants
slept
in
a
little
cottage
behind
the
stable
the
stable
door
was
locked
but
a
small
window
at
the
side
had
been
left
open
for
ventilation
she
scrambled
up
and
through
it
a
low
nickering
from
the
horses
greeted
her
they
knew
her
at
once
apache
was
contentedly
munching
his
hay
horses
sleep
or
eat
capriciously
to
slip
on
his
bridle
adjust
and
cinch
his
saddle
took
but
a
few
minutes
then
she
led
him
from
his
stall
silently
unbarred
the
big
doors
led
him
outside
again
closed
the
doors
carefully
and
mounted
him
the
night
was
clear
and
cold
the
moon
though
now
well
toward
the
western
mountains
still
made
it
bright
not
a
sound
had
beverly
uttered
for
over
two
hours
but
now
leaning
forward
she
clasped
both
arms
around
the
little
broncho
neck
rested
her
face
against
his
mane
and
whispered
apache
no
seldon
or
ashby
can
ever
be
told
that
they
are
lying
do
you
understand
we
are
going
back
to
people
who
do
say
such
things
it
a
long
distance
and
i
do
know
the
way
very
well
i
may
get
lost
but
i
do
believe
that
will
take
me
safely
home
apache
take
me
home
to
dear
old
woodbine
and
mother
and
uncle
athol
and
mammy
riah
and
athol
and
and
everybody
i
love
a
little
sob
ended
the
entreaty
and
as
though
he
understood
every
word
she
had
spoken
apache
gave
a
neigh
loud
enough
to
waken
the
seven
sleepers
beverly
clapped
her
hand
across
his
nostrils
as
she
cried
oh
you
must
you
will
wake
everybody
up
go
and
with
a
bound
apache
went
but
as
though
he
now
fully
understood
he
swept
like
a
shadow
across
the
lawn
out
through
a
side
gate
and
down
the
pike
jefferson
on
his
cot
in
the
cottage
roused
enough
to
mutter
dat
hawse
i
bettah
get
up
an
see
and
then
resumed
his
snore
just
where
apache
farewell
had
interrupted
it
and
out
in
the
great
lonely
silent
night
the
little
horse
sped
away
like
the
wind
for
a
mile
beverly
let
apache
gang
his
ain
gait
then
she
drew
him
down
to
the
steady
lope
which
he
could
keep
up
for
hours
without
tiring
the
lines
but
there
is
a
road
from
winchester
town
a
good
broad
highway
leading
down
might
have
been
written
of
the
first
five
miles
of
the
road
beverly
was
following
and
which
led
to
front
royal
those
miles
were
covered
in
less
than
half
an
hour
but
over
thirty
still
lay
ahead
and
some
of
them
would
have
been
pretty
rough
riding
even
in
summer
time
and
with
the
roads
in
good
condition
the
moon
was
now
dropping
behind
the
distant
range
of
the
great
north
mountains
the
air
was
chill
and
penetrating
and
the
dense
darkness
which
precedes
the
dawn
enveloped
all
the
world
front
royal
save
for
a
few
scattered
flickering
lights
lay
in
absolute
darkness
beverly
drew
a
quick
breath
and
shut
her
teeth
hard
from
front
royal
to
luray
her
way
must
be
on
dead
reckoning
and
apache
incomprehensible
instinct
and
those
miles
seemed
to
beverly
to
be
double
the
length
of
ordinary
miles
still
she
knew
that
she
could
not
go
far
astray
if
she
kept
between
the
railroad
and
the
river
so
plucking
up
her
courage
she
fled
through
the
sleeping
town
like
a
wraith
once
beyond
it
the
roads
branched
and
her
first
doubt
had
to
be
settled
dismounting
she
went
close
to
the
stone
mile
post
and
tried
to
read
the
sign
she
managed
to
make
out
the
name
but
it
might
as
well
have
been
greek
she
knew
nothing
of
the
town
indicated
three
miles
beyond
apache
she
said
desperately
do
you
know
that
it
up
to
then
she
looked
to
her
saddle
cinch
and
her
stirrup
straps
took
the
little
beast
head
in
her
arms
and
hugged
him
and
kissed
his
velvety
muzzle
yes
it
up
to
you
you
got
to
pull
out
for
woodbine
and
uncle
abel
somehow
perhaps
uncle
abel
name
was
the
pass
word
at
any
rate
apache
nuzzled
beverly
neighed
pawed
the
ground
impatiently
and
indicated
in
every
possible
way
that
he
would
do
all
any
horse
could
all
right
then
now
make
good
and
with
a
light
spring
she
was
again
in
the
saddle
there
is
no
time
to
dwell
in
detail
upon
that
dark
cold
terrible
ride
between
front
royal
and
luray
beverly
had
never
been
so
cold
in
all
her
life
she
let
apache
choose
his
own
way
and
take
his
own
gait
which
was
now
slow
and
doubtful
and
then
like
an
arrow
as
his
confidence
grew
luray
was
reached
in
time
and
skirted
then
all
was
plain
sailing
to
sprucy
branch
fourteen
miles
beyond
apache
had
often
been
to
luray
and
knew
every
inch
of
that
road
but
beverly
was
by
that
time
nearly
numb
from
the
cold
then
as
if
he
knew
the
terrible
need
he
stretched
away
with
the
utmost
speed
hills
rose
and
fell
but
his
heart
was
gay
with
only
eight
miles
away
had
just
been
struck
by
the
ship
clock
near
the
head
of
admiral
seldon
bed
the
seven
bells
rousing
him
slightly
he
had
never
ceased
counting
time
by
watches
and
as
sure
as
morning
watch
drew
near
he
would
waken
the
habits
of
early
years
are
not
readily
forsaken
the
faintest
suggestion
of
dawn
was
visible
over
the
blue
ridge
when
instead
of
turning
over
again
and
settling
down
for
his
last
snug
morning
nap
the
old
gentleman
started
wide
awake
and
keenly
alert
had
he
heard
a
horse
neigh
impossible
the
stables
were
too
far
from
his
bedchamber
for
any
such
sound
to
reach
him
reckon
i
must
have
been
dreaming
of
beverly
and
her
little
skallawag
he
said
softly
and
was
about
to
settle
down
once
more
when
a
neigh
loud
clear
and
insistent
pierced
the
crisp
morning
air
what
the
he
cried
springing
out
of
bed
with
surprising
agility
for
his
years
and
switching
on
the
electric
lights
hurrying
to
the
window
which
commanded
the
sweep
of
the
driveway
he
peered
out
in
the
faint
light
the
indistinct
outline
of
a
horse
was
visible
now
which
of
those
young
devils
of
colts
has
escaped
was
his
query
as
he
hastily
donned
his
clothes
and
started
down
stairs
but
that
neigh
had
been
heard
by
others
also
and
as
the
admiral
reached
the
end
of
the
hall
ashby
came
from
her
bedroom
arrayed
in
bath
robe
and
bed
slippers
what
is
it
she
asked
the
lord
only
knows
one
of
those
confounded
colts
broken
loose
i
dare
say
and
if
it
is
i
crack
uncle
abel
head
for
him
and
away
he
hurried
but
uncle
abel
who
possessed
six
instead
of
five
senses
the
sixth
being
horse
sense
had
heard
that
neigh
too
and
the
ceremony
of
his
robing
requiring
less
time
than
the
admiral
he
was
already
speeding
toward
that
sound
as
fast
as
his
old
legs
would
carry
him
as
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
he
was
welcomed
by
a
most
jubilant
neigh
and
the
next
second
had
reached
the
steaming
apache
and
exclaiming
ma
what
done
happen
is
dat
yo
miss
baby
honey
is
yo
daid
for
a
rigid
unconscious
little
figure
was
leaning
forward
with
her
arms
clasped
tightly
around
the
panting
horse
neck
quicker
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
abel
had
unclasped
the
clinging
arms
and
was
tenderly
lifting
her
from
the
horse
back
at
that
moment
the
admiral
burst
through
the
big
front
door
and
came
striding
across
the
lawn
storming
at
each
step
you
abel
you
old
fool
how
did
that
horse
break
loose
how
my
god
who
is
that
for
he
was
now
near
enough
to
see
the
three
figures
and
to
hear
abel
sobs
which
punctuated
his
words
as
he
held
the
helpless
little
figure
in
his
arms
what
is
it
what
has
happened
gawd
only
knows
mars
athol
but
me
wid
dis
chile
quick
please
sur
she
lak
ter
die
ef
we
don
do
no
need
of
that
request
relieved
of
his
precious
burden
apache
sped
away
for
the
stable
his
duty
faithfully
performed
there
many
willing
hands
cared
for
him
while
his
little
mistress
the
excitement
fatigue
and
cold
having
completed
miss
woodhull
cruel
work
was
tenderly
carried
into
the
house
by
old
abel
and
her
uncle
the
latter
muttering
it
some
of
that
damned
woman
work
i
know
it
is
and
i
bring
the
whole
school
down
about
her
ears
unless
i
find
out
the
truth
of
it
all
my
little
girl
my
little
girl
over
miles
in
the
dead
of
night
alone
and
nearly
frozen
mary
mary
mammy
everybody
come
quick
and
phone
for
doctor
marshall
but
beverly
was
not
dying
and
within
an
hour
under
her
mother
and
good
old
mammy
riah
ministrations
was
warm
and
snug
in
her
bed
though
weak
and
exhausted
when
the
doctor
came
he
ordered
absolute
quiet
and
undisturbed
rest
she
will
soon
drop
off
to
sleep
and
let
her
sleep
for
hours
if
she
can
she
is
utterly
worn
out
and
as
much
from
nerve
strain
as
physical
fatigue
if
i
know
anything
of
symptoms
what
happened
seldon
the
good
lord
who
brought
her
through
it
only
knows
for
i
do
though
i
mean
to
learn
as
soon
as
that
child
is
in
a
condition
to
tell
me
and
then
by
the
great
guns
something
going
to
let
loose
i
talked
with
that
stone
image
of
a
woman
at
leslie
manor
and
i
know
what
it
can
say
it
is
a
woman
it
a
blight
upon
the
sex
a
freak
it
and
when
lightning
strikes
stone
something
bursts
to
smithereens
and
by
all
that
powerful
the
lightning
going
to
strike

all
alone
in
the
dead
of

night

i
all
bowled

good

the

paced
the

like
a

lion

a
woman
sputtered
fat
little
doctor
marshall
i
be
in
again
toward
evening

worry
about
her
for

out
all
right

a
constitution
like
india
rubber
well
may
the
lord
help
that
old
maid
if
she
does
was
the
significant
answer
chapter
xviii
when
the
lightning
struck
hurry
up
bev
you
be
late
for
breakfast
you
done
some
sleeping
since
ten
last
night
called
sally
pounding
upon
the
door
of
bedroom
a
but
getting
no
response
aileen
had
already
knocked
and
called
without
eliciting
a
reply
and
both
the
girls
were
worried
but
tried
not
to
show
it
when
ten
more
minutes
passed
in
silence
aileen
looked
troubled
and
asked
do
you
think
she
is
ill
ought
we
to
call
miss
stetson
miss
stetson
snapped
sally
if
she
is
ill
she
would
rather
see
the
old
nick
himself
than
miss
stetson
i
run
and
get
mrs
bonnell
in
spite
of
her
anxiety
aileen
laughed
true
enough
miss
stetson
was
not
exactly
the
person
to
call
in
when
one
was
that
true
bonnell
will
be
the
one
to
call
but
i
wish
bev
answer
it
scares
me
almost
to
death
and
i
like
right
well
to
know
what
happened
last
night
beverly
ashby
is
not
the
sort
of
girl
to
go
up
in
the
air
over
nothing
believe
me
but
she
was
pretty
high
up
last
night
do
go
for
bonny
sally
i
too
nervous
to
wait
another
minute
all
right
and
away
sped
sally
down
the
corridor
as
she
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
almost
ran
into
wesley
has
yo
heard
what
done
happen
las
night
miss
sally
he
asked
excitedly
no
what
was
it
asked
sally
eagerly
miss
hawse
done
been
stole
de
stable
saddle
bridle
all
never
cried
sally
yas
dey
done
been
yonder
in
de
study
miss
woodhull
it
right
dis
minute
and
wesley
hurried
away
to
the
dining
room
apache
stolen
oh
sally
gasped
she
recalled
the
words
which
beverly
had
spoken
the
very
first
hour
of
their
acquaintance
it
would
take
very
little
to
make
me
light
out
for
woodbine
six
months
had
passed
since
those
words
had
been
spoken
and
during
those
months
beverly
had
known
some
lonely
hours
as
well
as
happy
ones
she
had
been
made
miserable
more
than
once
by
miss
bayliss
miss
stetson
and
miss
woodhull
who
seemed
to
have
conceived
a
most
unmerited
dislike
for
the
girl
sally
knew
nothing
of
miss
woodhull
dislike
for
admiral
seldon
because
he
had
presumed
to
question
her
policy
nor
could
a
girl
of
sally
sweet
nature
possibly
understand
the
smallness
of
one
which
would
take
out
upon
a
defenceless
young
girl
the
resentment
which
she
harbored
toward
her
older
relative
nevertheless
that
was
precisely
the
situation
and
miss
stetson
and
miss
bayliss
were
miss
mirrors
sally
soon
found
bonnell
and
together
they
hurried
up
stairs
but
bonnell
was
no
more
successful
in
getting
a
response
to
her
calls
than
the
girls
had
been
sally
can
you
climb
she
asked
yes
bonnell
answered
sally
wholly
bewildered
then
crawl
through
your
window
and
along
the
roof
to
beverly
i
not
going
to
stir
up
a
fuss
unless
i
am
compelled
to
look
in
and
tell
me
what
you
see
be
careful
dear
she
ended
as
sally
scuttled
over
the
window
sill
they
leaned
out
to
watch
her
she
gave
a
little
cry
when
she
discovered
that
the
room
was
empty
what
is
it
they
asked
in
a
breath
she
she
is
there
at
all
gasped
sally
not
there
raise
the
window
and
go
in
and
unfasten
the
door
sally
be
quick
for
the
breakfast
bell
will
ring
in
a
few
minutes
sally
did
as
bidden
the
room
was
as
undisturbed
as
it
had
been
twelve
hours
before
aileen
ran
to
the
closet
her
riding
things
are
gone
she
cried
and
wesley
just
told
me
that
apache
had
been
stolen
in
the
night
wailed
sally
there
is
more
to
this
than
we
thought
said
bonnell
considerably
perturbed
now
i
report
to
miss
woodhull
she
turned
and
hurried
from
the
room
but
had
not
gone
ten
steps
down
the
corridor
when
she
met
that
lady
with
wrath
and
fire
in
her
eye
what
is
this
fresh
annoyance
concerning
beverly
ashby
jefferson
has
just
told
me
that
her
horse
was
stolen
in
the
night
a
likely
story
it
is
some
new
deception
upon
her
part
such
duplicity
it
has
never
been
my
misfortune
to
encounter
i
wish
to
speak
to
her
at
once
stormed
the
principal
striding
into
the
study
now
to
be
responsible
for
a
young
girl
not
yet
sixteen
years
of
age
and
one
whose
family
is
widely
known
throughout
the
entire
state
and
to
discover
that
said
young
lady
has
been
missing
from
beneath
one
roof
all
night
is
to
say
the
least
disconcerting
for
the
first
time
in
her
domineering
life
the
empress
was
thoroughly
alarmed
alarmed
for
beverly
safety
the
reputation
of
the
school
and
last
but
by
no
means
least
for
what
such
a
denouement
might
bring
to
pass
in
the
future
financial
outlook
for
her
business
the
school
had
paid
well
but
how
long
would
its
patronage
continue
if
the
facts
of
this
case
became
widely
known
miss
woodhull
was
an
alien
in
the
land
of
her
adoption
she
had
never
tried
to
be
anything
else
she
had
established
herself
at
leslie
manor
because
she
wished
to
acquire
health
and
wealth
and
she
had
achieved
her
objects
to
a
wonderful
degree
but
she
had
made
no
friends
she
did
not
wish
to
make
friends
among
the
southerners
she
despised
them
and
all
their
customs
and
though
in
the
beginning
they
had
made
many
gracious
overtures
of
friendship
she
had
repulsed
them
at
every
turn
consequently
they
soon
began
to
regard
her
with
indifference
if
not
with
contempt
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
common
between
them
she
was
merely
a
business
proposition
in
their
midst
their
children
could
acquire
beneath
her
roof
the
education
they
desired
for
them
and
there
it
ended
if
as
rumor
stated
she
really
came
of
gentle
northern
blood
it
must
have
received
a
very
peculiar
infusion
in
her
immediate
forebears
they
missed
something
of
the
noblesse
oblige
which
was
to
them
as
a
matter
of
course
so
with
each
passing
year
the
gulf
had
imperceptibly
widened
until
miss
woodhull
was
as
much
alone
in
hospitable
virginia
as
though
she
lived
in
borneo
upon
realizing
that
beverly
was
really
missing
her
first
impulse
was
to
phone
to
kilton
hall
for
of
course
she
had
risen
early
and
rushed
off
to
see
athol
miss
woodhull
blood
boiled
at
the
thought
kilton
hall
of
all
places
the
one
she
detested
most
it
had
been
a
thorn
in
her
flesh
from
the
moment
she
knew
of
its
existence
for
its
policy
was
diametrically
opposed
to
her
own
still
inquiries
must
be
made
without
further
delay
but
she
would
be
discreet
so
she
called
the
school
up
by
phone
had
they
seen
anything
of
a
stray
horse
one
of
her
pupil
horses
had
escaped
during
the
night
and
she
was
phoning
in
every
direction
in
her
endeavors
to
find
it
it
was
miss
ashby
horse
and
he
might
have
made
his
way
as
far
as
the
hall
no
there
was
no
stray
animal
there
but
kilton
would
have
a
thorough
search
made
in
their
neighborhood
but
kilton
was
a
far
cry
from
being
a
fool
why
should
miss
woodhull
think
a
runaway
horse
had
run
all
that
distance
and
if
he
kilton
was
fully
convinced
that
he
had
not
run
riderless
he
had
not
forgotten
that
october
runaway
moreover
he
had
detected
a
repressed
excitement
in
the
voice
over
that
phone
he
very
quietly
conferred
with
kilton
and
that
lady
was
quite
as
as
her
spouse
they
decided
to
maintain
a
discreet
silence
but
to
make
some
quiet
inquiries
a
few
hours
later
smedes
the
doctor
body
servant
was
sent
upon
an
errand
to
the
little
village
nearest
leslie
manor
and
smedes
knew
every
servant
at
that
school
when
he
returned
and
kilton
became
considerably
wiser
regarding
the
true
facts
of
the
case
but
decided
to
say
nothing
to
beverly
brother
for
the
present
but
they
kept
in
constant
communication
with
leslie
manor
via
smedes
and
jefferson
far
and
wide
did
leslie
manor
send
messages
and
messengers
no
horse
was
to
be
found
in
the
school
chaos
reigned
and
the
usual
sunday
decorum
and
peace
went
by
the
board
completely
some
of
the
girls
were
rebellious
some
hysterical
some
scolded
and
some
wept
silently
and
to
a
unit
they
all
blamed
miss
woodhull
for
the
situation
bonnell
and
several
of
the
teachers
were
wholly
indignant
that
she
had
not
instantly
communicated
with
beverly
family
as
was
obviously
her
duty
bonnell
openly
urged
it
miss
woodhull
the
idea
beverly
would
come
back
when
she
recovered
from
her
fit
of
sulks
and
would
be
properly
punished
for
her
conduct
by
expulsion
she
had
already
transgressed
to
a
degree
to
warrant
it
and
had
been
warned
the
evening
before
to
that
effect
ah
breathed
bonnell
at
this
admission
communicate
with
people
absurd
why
magnify
such
a
trivial
matter
girls
had
made
believe
to
run
away
from
the
school
before
and
would
doubtless
do
so
again
they
invariably
ran
back
again
and
beverly
would
do
likewise
when
she
got
ready
she
was
probably
with
some
friend
in
the
neighborhood
she
was
in
the
habit
of
forming
friendships
with
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
people
that
her
horse
was
also
gone
might
be
a
mere
coincidence
or
else
she
was
trying
to
frighten
them
all
and
would
come
riding
back
by
sundown
she
was
capable
of
almost
any
insubordination
and
rising
at
dawn
and
riding
off
somewhere
was
merely
a
fresh
demonstration
of
it
that
miss
woodhull
was
merely
whistling
to
keep
her
courage
up
all
well
knew
but
sunset
failed
to
bring
the
runaway
and
kilton
hall
knew
of
this
fact
right
speedily
then
athol
was
called
to
the
doctor
study
and
the
facts
told
him
the
boy
was
thunderstruck
and
blurted
out
it
that
old
harridan
then
blushed
crimson
and
kilton
did
not
reprove
the
outbreak
but
pardoned
it
upon
the
ground
of
excitement
you
would
better
call
up
your
uncle
at
once
athol
i
do
not
wish
to
interfere
or
criticise
but
i
know
what
i
should
wish
if
it
were
my
daughter
said
kilton
thank
you
ever
so
much
kilton
i
do
it
right
off
and
he
hurried
into
the
little
room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
where
the
phone
stood
kilton
following
while
the
doctor
wondered
what
the
next
move
must
be
a
moment
later
he
joined
them
athol
soon
had
woodbine
on
the
wire
and
then
ensued
a
funny
conversation
oh
uncle
athol
is
that

say

jerked
over
his
shoulder
but
they
are
all

almost
worried
to
death
they
heard
of
it
early
this
morning
and
wanted
to
get
word
to

off
but
did
dare
butt
in

coming
to
her
she
rates
it
all
right
all
right
she
made
things
just
too
darned
hot
for
bev
and
a
whole
bunch
of
the
girls
up
there
everybody
hates
her
eh
as
kilton
hand
was
laid
warningly
upon
his
shoulder
kilton
had
turned
hastily
away
he
could
not
trust
his
countenance
nor
did
he
wish
to
hear
too
much
the
boy
which
had
never
died
in
him
was
rebelling
in
sympathy
with
athol
a
few
more
sentences
and
athol
hung
up
the
receiver
and
sought
the
doctor
he
was
boiling
with
rage
brace
up
old
chap
it
nothing
serious
you
may
be
sure
of
that
or
your
uncle
would
have
sent
for
you
at
once
and
remember
mum
the
word
yes
sir
i
remember
sir
and
thank
you
a
whole
lot
sir
for
letting
me
phone
i
hold
my
jaw
i
mean
i
wo
say
a
single
word
a
pretty
state
of
things
i
be
bound
stormed
kilton
when
athol
had
gone
why
that
woman
he
did
not
complete
his
sentence
i
wish
she
would
sell
out
and
go
to
live
in
jericho
or
some
other
remote
place
cried
kilton
petulantly
then
added
eagerly
oh
avary
perhaps
she
will
after
all
this
it
will
stir
the
whole
countryside
chapter
xix
for
happier
days
while
athol
was
fuming
at
kilton
hall
and
trying
to
keep
his
promise
to
his
uncle
to
hold
his
jaw
though
it
very
nearly
resulted
in
lockjaw
the
ferment
at
leslie
manor
grew
the
older
girls
had
grown
rebellious
almost
to
a
unit
and
the
entire
school
was
or
hysterical
the
inevitable
outcome
of
a
discipline
which
had
steadily
grown
more
severe
and
arbitrary
a
nagging
surveillance
which
only
incited
in
the
pupils
a
wild
desire
to
do
the
very
things
of
which
they
were
unjustly
suspected
and
accused
they
were
never
trusted
their
simplest
most
innocent
acts
were
misconstrued
their
word
doubted
and
as
in
beverly
case
miss
woodhull
had
more
than
once
cruelly
baited
and
insulted
them
truly
the
years
had
wrought
strangenesses
in
her
and
a
more
policy
than
she
had
adopted
for
the
past
five
it
would
be
hard
to
conceive
bonnell
and
some
of
the
teachers
had
been
painfully
alive
to
all
this
for
a
long
time
two
or
three
of
the
instructors
had
resigned
and
sought
positions
elsewhere
unable
to
work
in
the
unhappy
atmosphere
which
miss
woodhull
created
once
bonnell
had
bearded
the
lioness
in
her
den
and
striven
to
remonstrate
with
her
which
had
drawn
upon
her
devoted
head
such
a
storm
of
resentment
that
she
had
then
and
there
tendered
her
resignation
also
at
that
point
miss
woodhull
realizing
how
entirely
dependent
she
was
upon
bonnell
perfect
management
of
leslie
manor
had
actually
apologized
and
begged
bonnell
to
remain
she
excused
her
language
upon
the
score
of
excessive
fatigue
after
so
many
years
of
unremitting
work
unremitting
bonnell
smiled
but
accepted
the
apology
her
livelihood
depended
upon
her
own
work
and
she
also
loved
the
place
and
had
many
friends
in
that
part
of
the
world
but
the
idea
of
miss
woodhull
arduous
work
was
certainly
amusing
miss
woodhull
never
did
a
thing
but
criticise
from
one
day
end
to
the
next
she
had
long
since
given
up
all
classes
and
now
merely
presided
as
the
autocrat
of
the
establishment
unloved
by
any
feared
by
many
disliked
by
all
if
miss
stetson
and
miss
baylis
really
did
like
her
they
also
shared
the
fear
she
inspired
more
than
one
upheaval
had
occurred
in
the
course
of
the
existence
but
had
always
been
quickly
hushed
up
though
vague
rumors
had
circulated
throughout
the
community
during
later
years
however
more
than
one
girl
had
been
dismissed
so
miss
woodhull
stated
for
unbecoming
conduct
the
girls
themselves
told
different
stories
for
the
past
three
years
and
kilton
had
been
quietly
trying
to
purchase
leslie
manor
through
agents
in
richmond
for
a
good
bit
of
inside
information
had
come
to
them
regarding
the
manner
in
which
matters
were
shaping
there
and
their
pride
in
the
community
and
in
warren
county
shrank
from
some
possible
crisis
which
would
bring
upon
it
an
unpleasant
notoriety
in
one
sense
the
girls
in
leslie
manor
were
well
cared
for
their
physical
and
personal
welfare
were
safe
in
bonnell
hands
and
the
instruction
was
thorough
and
excellent
but
in
the
wise
development
of
character
in
the
trustful
happy
confidence
which
girlhood
should
know
in
the
harmony
which
is
girlhood
right
or
the
harmless
frolicing
and
healthful
bodily
development
from
spontaneous
activities
they
were
sadly
lacking
everything
was
cut
and
dried
all
things
ordered
from
miss
woodhull
austere
standpoint
no
wonder
that
the
school
harbored
pettys
and
eleanors
and
electras
and
a
few
other
oddities
until
this
year
it
had
never
sheltered
a
beverly
and
this
same
beverly
was
likely
to
prove
though
with
no
such
intention
upon
her
part
its
waterloo
and
thus
stood
affairs
that
sunday
evening
after
beverly
flight
and
then
from
a
source
least
expected
bomb
number
was
hurled
all
day
long
electra
sanderson
had
been
strangely
silent
at
eight
she
marched
down
to
miss
woodhull
study
rapped
upon
the
door
and
was
bidden
enter
that
lady
sat
with
her
hand
upon
the
telephone
receiver
about
to
remove
it
she
now
fully
realized
that
admiral
seldon
must
be
communicated
with
at
once
she
must
face
the
music
this
time
she
almost
hailed
electra
with
joy
as
the
source
of
a
brief
respite
electra
crossed
the
room
rested
one
hand
upon
the
corner
of
miss
woodhull
desk
plucked
up
her
courage
and
plunged
in
head
first
you
scolded
beverly
ashby
for
receivin
a
letter
she
did
it
was
hers
at
all
it
was
petty
gaylord
i
saw
her
receive
it
i
want
to
tell
tales
but
i
have
beverly
blamed
for
something
she
never
done
she
always
been
nice
and
polite
to
me
and
petty
aint
been
eleanor
allen
that
letter
and
brought
it
down
here
to
you
just
to
get
beverly
into
trouble
i
her
do
it
she
took
it
right
out
of
beverly
history
book
petty
dropped
it
in
history
class
and
never
knew
what
had
become
of
it
the
next
morning
beverly
came
into
our
room
and
told
petty
that
she
had
picked
it
up
to
return
it
to
her
but
when
she
opened
her
book
to
get
it
it
was
gone
but
petty
believe
her
and
said
awful
things
to
her
till
beverly
just
looked
at
her
the
way
she
look
when
she
people
well
miss
woodhull
knew
that
look
and
went
out
of
the
room
but
eleanor
had
that
letter
all
the
time
i
saw
her
sneak
into
beverly
room
and
snitch
it
i
do
know
what
she
wanted
with
it
but
after
i
saw
her
take
it
i
watched
her
every
single
minute
i
thought
she
would
give
it
to
petty
of
course
they
so
stuck
on
each
other
but
she
did
she
just
kept
and
kept
it
for
some
mucker
trick
and
when
i
saw
her
comin
down
to
your
study
last
night
i
knew
just
as
well
as
anything
what
she
was
up
to
she
hates
beverly
just
because
she
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
her
and
laughs
at
petty
and
her
mash
petty
just
dead
in
love
with
that
feller
at
annapolis
now
if
you
do
believe
what
i
told
you
you
can
just
send
for
both
of
them
and
ask
them
yourself
i
do
care
a
cent
what
you
do
for
i
going
to
leave
this
hateful
school
tomorrow
and
you
ca
stop
me
and
i
tell
dad
all
about
this
fracas
too
i
hate
you
and
everything
in
the
school
so
there
now
and
with
this
final
explosion
eleanor
turned
and
fled
from
the
room
erin
go
bra
if
eleanor
story
had
not
collapsed
miss
woodhull
her
english
certainly
would
have
compassed
that
result
she
fell
back
upon
her
chair
panting
just
then
her
phone
rang
bomb
no
no
admiral
seldon
your
niece
is
not
here
this
evening
she
is
temporarily
absent
when
do
i
expect
her
to
return
oh
er
i
think
by
tomorrow
at
latest
is
she
where
you
can
communicate
with
her
by
phone
oh
certainly
certainly
the
number
why
er
i
must
ascertain
for
you
you
must
know
immediately
you
have
heard
alarming
rumors
ridiculous
your
niece
missing
since
last
evening
preposterous
absurd
yes
of
course
if
you
insist
and
you
will
be
over
by
the
first
train
in
the
morning
really
you
are
my
pupils
are
well
looked
after
and
cared
for
you
have
reason
to
believe
they
are
your
tone
hardly
bears
out
your
statement
she
must
be
here
to
receive
you
when
you
arrive
oh
certainly
well
the
empress
came
nearer
fainting
after
that
conversation
than
she
had
ever
come
in
all
her
life
but
such
a
nature
as
hers
must
have
a
vent
for
its
spleen
and
what
better
ones
than
eleanor
and
petty
the
cause
of
all
the
mischief
the
electric
bell
which
summoned
them
to
miss
woodhull
study
fairly
sputtered
sparks
eleanor
was
sulkily
silent
petty
as
usual
in
tears
tears
were
petty
long
suit
we
have
not
time
to
dwell
upon
the
details
of
that
interview
even
if
we
would
eleanor
was
one
of
the
few
girls
to
really
be
expelled
from
the
school
and
petty
promptly
fled
to
darling
mamma
and
reggie
early
monday
morning
admiral
seldon
arrived
upon
the
scene
and
was
closeted
with
the
empress
for
two
solid
hours
this
time
his
guns
were
silenced
and
those
passing
the
study
door
could
hear
a
steady
rumble
like
heavy
firing
afar
off
and
in
the
intervals
lighter
shots
as
though
a
gatling
gun
were
popping
its
stacatto
fire
ultimately
the
heavy
gun
silenced
the
gatling
the
last
shot
was
something
upon
this
order
your
methods
madam
may
prevail
elsewhere
but
permit
me
to
say
that
they
are
a
dead
failure
here
you
are
not
training
cart
horses
but
thoroughbreds
and
you
ca
lash
and
spur
breed
no
my
niece
will
return
to
leslie
manor
while
it
continues
under
its
present
management
and
the
next
time
i
select
a
school
for
her
the
character
and
personality
of
its
head
will
influence
my
choice
far
more
than
the
curriculum
or
modern
methods
we
have
managed
in
bygone
days
to
produce
some
pretty
fine
specimens
of
the
true
gentlewoman
by
the
old
methods
in
vogue
in
this
part
of
the
united
states
and
i
am
hopeful
that
we
may
produce
a
few
more
before
the
race
dies
out
yes
i
assuredly
advise
a
rest
madam
and
that
you
prolong
it
indefinitely
it
will
benefit
you
immensely
i
am
sure
and
also
a
great
many
others
i
have
the
honor
to
wish
you
and
you
need
feel
no
further
concern
regarding
my
niece
the
following
week
the
easter
recess
began
during
that
recess
miss
woodhull
went
to
a
famous
sanitarium
in
the
state
in
order
to
restore
her
nerves
she
did
not
know
that
the
physician
in
charge
was
one
of
admiral
seldon
oldest
friends
he
strongly
advised
against
resuming
her
duties
after
the
easter
recess
and
urged
her
to
discontinue
all
work
for
at
least
a
year
and
to
seek
an
entire
change
of
scene
she
followed
his
advice
so
far
as
change
of
scene
was
concerned
but
her
idea
of
a
complete
rest
was
an
immediate
and
very
active
affiliation
with
her
suffering
sisters
in
a
crusade
for
their
rights
and
the
overthrow
of
the
oppression
of
the
sterner
sex
she
sailed
for
england
and
once
in
london
became
one
of
the
most
rampant
of
the
wronged
ones
meanwhile
the
school
was
being
conducted
by
miss
baylis
who
for
five
blissful
weeks
reigned
supreme
while
hope
hinted
a
permanent
one
but
alas
nothing
is
so
delusive
as
human
hope
that
city
across
the
sea
settled
miss
baylis
plans
and
miss
woodhull
future
that
lady
had
found
her
true
place
among
england
gentlewomen
though
she
had
utterly
failed
to
do
so
among
virginia
over
there
she
could
chuck
books
at
the
heads
of
dignified
judges
and
glory
in
seeing
the
old
gentlemen
dodge
she
could
heave
her
shoes
at
the
chancellor
and
shout
and
yell
with
her
wronged
sisters
she
could
smash
windows
blow
up
people
houses
arrange
and
cavort
with
the
maddest
of
her
feminine
friends
and
give
a
glorious
vent
to
all
the
long
belligerence
in
her
makeup
to
the
everlasting
humiliation
mortification
shame
and
horror
of
the
gentlewomen

her
own

no

but
during
the
following
month
workmen
appeared
as
by
magic
and
labored
like
gnomes
all
day
and
almost
all
night
too
new
buildings
were
erected
all
sorts
of
strange
changes
made
in
the
old
ones
the
place
assumed
huge
proportions
what
could
it
all
mean
in
august
the

a

of

for
any
pupils
who
were
ailing
or
in
need
of
a
complete
rest
the
school
was
to
be
opened
september
thirtieth
under
an
entirely
new
auspices
and
certainly
under
very
new
conditions
it
was
a
daring
venture
a
complete
innovation
but
and
kilton
were
sanguine
of
success
whether
their
dreams
were
realized
or
not
must
be
told
in
a
dixie
girl
and
down
in
woodbine
well
three
hilarious
young
people
were
nearly
tearing
the
world
to
tatters
in
their
joy
in
may
admiral
seldon
had
taken
them
to
washington
and
annapolis
where
they
had
sure
enough
had
the
time
of
their
lives
then
the
fever
increasing
ashby
joined
them
in
philadelphia
and
away
they
went
to

niagara
and
finally
to
europe
where
the
summer
was
spent
in
one
round
of
ecstasy
