note
socialism
utopian
and
scientific
needs
no
preface
it
ranks
with
the
communist
manifesto
as
one
of
the
indispensable
books
for
any
one
desiring
to
understand
the
modern
socialist
movement
it
has
been
translated
into
every
language
where
capitalism
prevails
and
its
circulation
is
more
rapid
than
ever
before
in
when
our
publishing
house
had
just
begun
the
circulation
of
socialist
books
we
brought
out
the
first
american
reprint
of
the
authorized
translation
of
this
work
the
many
editions
required
by
the
growing
demand
have
worn
out
the
plates
and
we
are
now
reprinting
it
in
more
attractive
form
it
will
be
observed
that
the
author
in
his
introduction
says
that
from
to
copies
of
the
book
were
sold
in
germany
our
own
sales
of
the
book
in
america
from
to
were
not
less
than
last
year
we
published
the
first
english
version
of
the
larger
work
to
which
the
author
refers
in
the
opening
page
of
his
introduction
the
translation
is
by
austin
lewis
and
bears
the
title
landmarks
of
scientific
socialism
cloth
it
includes
the
greater
portion
of
the
original
work
omitting
what
is
presented
here
and
also
some
of
the
personalities
due
to
the
heat
of
controversy
frederick
engels
is
second
only
to
karl
marx
among
socialist
writers
and
his
influence
in
the
united
states
is
only
beginning
june
introduction
the
present
little
book
is
originally
a
part
of
a
larger
whole
about
dühring
at
berlin
university
suddenly
and
rather
clamorously
announced
his
conversion
to
socialism
and
presented
the
german
public
not
only
with
an
elaborate
socialist
theory
but
also
with
a
complete
practical
plan
for
the
reorganization
of
society
as
a
matter
of
course
he
fell
foul
of
his
predecessors
above
all
he
honored
marx
by
pouring
out
upon
him
the
full
vials
of
his
wrath
this
took
place
about
the
time
when
the
two
sections
of
the
socialist
party
in
germany
eisenachers
and
lassallians
had
just
effected
their
fusion
and
thus
obtained
not
only
an
immense
increase
of
strength
but
what
was
more
the
faculty
of
employing
the
whole
of
this
strength
against
the
common
enemy
the
socialist
party
in
germany
was
fast
becoming
a
power
but
to
make
it
a
power
the
first
condition
was
that
the
unity
should
not
be
imperiled
and
dühring
openly
proceeded
to
form
around
himself
a
sect
the
nucleus
of
a
future
separate
party
it
thus
became
necessary
to
take
up
the
gauntlet
thrown
down
to
us
and
to
fight
out
the
struggle
whether
we
liked
it
or
not
this
however
though
it
might
not
be
an
over
difficult
was
evidently
a
business
as
is
well
known
we
germans
are
of
a
terribly
ponderous
radical
profundity
or
profound
radicality
whatever
you
may
like
to
call
it
whenever
anyone
of
us
expounds
what
he
considers
a
new
doctrine
he
has
first
to
elaborate
it
into
an
system
he
has
to
prove
that
both
the
first
principles
of
logic
and
the
fundamental
laws
of
the
universe
had
existed
from
all
eternity
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
ultimately
lead
to
this
crowning
theory
and
dühring
in
this
respect
was
quite
up
to
the
national
mark
nothing
less
than
a
complete
system
of
philosophy
mental
moral
natural
and
historical
a
complete
system
of
political
economy
and
socialism
and
finally
a
critical
history
of
political
economy
three
big
volumes
in
octavo
heavy
extrinsically
and
intrinsically
three
of
arguments
mobilized
against
all
previous
philosophers
and
economists
in
general
and
against
marx
in
particular
in
fact
an
attempt
at
a
complete
revolution
in
science
these
were
what
i
should
have
to
tackle
i
had
to
treat
of
all
and
every
possible
subject
from
the
concepts
of
time
and
space
to
bimetallism
from
the
eternity
of
matter
and
motion
to
the
perishable
nature
of
moral
ideas
from
darwin
natural
selection
to
the
education
of
youth
in
a
future
society
anyhow
the
systematic
comprehensiveness
of
my
opponent
gave
me
the
opportunity
of
developing
in
opposition
to
him
and
in
a
more
connected
form
than
had
previously
been
done
the
views
held
by
marx
and
myself
on
this
great
variety
of
subjects
and
that
was
the
principal
reason
which
made
me
undertake
this
otherwise
ungrateful
task
my
reply
was
first
published
in
a
series
of
articles
in
the
leipzig
vorwärts
the
chief
organ
of
the
socialist
party
and
later
on
as
a
book
herrn

dühring
revolution
in
science
a
second
edition
of
which
appeared
in
zürich
at
the
request
of
my
friend
paul
lafargue
now
representative
of
lille
in
the
french
chamber
of
deputies
i
arranged
three
chapters
of
this
book
as
a
pamphlet
which
he
translated
and
published
in
under
the
title
utopique
et
socialisme
from
this
french
text
a
polish
and
a
spanish
edition
were
prepared
in
our
german
friends
brought
out
the
pamphlet
in
the
original
language
italian
russian
danish
dutch
and
roumanian
translations
based
upon
the
german
text
have
since
been
published
thus
with
the
present
english
edition
this
little
book
circulates
in
ten
languages
i
am
not
aware
that
any
other
socialist
work
not
even
our
communist
manifesto
of
or
marx
capital
has
been
so
often
translated
in
germany
it
has
had
four
editions
of
about
copies
in
all
the
economic
terms
used
in
this
work
as
far
as
they
are
new
agree
with
those
used
in
the
english
edition
of
marx
capital
we
call
production
of
commodities
that
economic
phase
where
articles
are
produced
not
only
for
the
use
of
the
producers
but
also
for
purposes
of
exchange
that
is
as
not
as
this
phase
extends
from
the
first
beginnings
of
production
for
exchange
down
to
our
present
time
it
attains
its
full
development
under
capitalist
production
only
that
is
under
conditions
where
the
capitalist
the
owner
of
the
means
of
production
employs
for
wages
laborers
people
deprived
of
all
means
of
production
except
their
own
and
pockets
the
excess
of
the
selling
price
of
the
products
over
his
outlay
we
divide
the
history
of
industrial
production
since
the
middle
ages
into
three
periods
handicraft
small
master
craftsmen
with
a
few
journeymen
and
apprentices
where
each
laborer
produces
the
complete
article
manufacture
where
greater
numbers
of
workmen
grouped
in
one
large
establishment
produce
the
complete
article
on
the
principle
of
division
of
labor
each
workman
performing
only
one
partial
operation
so
that
the
product
is
complete
only
after
having
passed
successively
through
the
hands
of
all
modern
industry
where
the
product
is
produced
by
machinery
driven
by
power
and
where
the
work
of
the
laborer
is
limited
to
superintending
and
correcting
the
performances
of
the
mechanical
agent
i
am
perfectly
aware
that
the
contents
of
this
work
will
meet
with
objection
from
a
considerable
portion
of
the
british
public
but
if
we
continentals
had
taken
the
slightest
notice
of
the
prejudices
of
british
respectability
we
should
be
even
worse
off
than
we
are
this
book
defends
what
we
call
historical
materialism
and
the
word
materialism
grates
upon
the
ears
of
the
immense
majority
of
british
readers
agnosticism
might
be
tolerated
but
materialism
is
utterly
inadmissible
and
yet
the
original
home
of
all
modern
materialism
from
the
seventeenth
century
onwards
is
england
materialism
is
the
son
of
great
britain
already
the
british
schoolman
duns
scotus
asked
it
was
impossible
for
matter
to
think
in
order
to
effect
this
miracle
he
took
refuge
in
god
omnipotence
he
made
theology
preach
materialism
moreover
he
was
a
nominalist
nominalism
the
first
form
of
materialism
is
chiefly
found
among
the
english
schoolmen
the
real
progenitor
of
english
materialism
is
bacon
to
him
natural
philosophy
is
the
only
true
philosophy
and
physics
based
upon
the
experience
of
the
senses
is
the
chiefest
part
of
natural
philosophy
anaxagoras
and
his
homoiomeriæ
democritus
and
his
atoms
he
often
quotes
as
his
authorities
according
to
him
the
senses
are
infallible
and
the
source
of
all
knowledge
all
science
is
based
on
experience
and
consists
in
subjecting
the
data
furnished
by
the
senses
to
a
rational
method
of
investigation
induction
analysis
comparison
observation
experiment
are
the
principal
forms
of
such
a
rational
method
among
the
qualities
inherent
in
matter
motion
is
the
first
and
foremost
not
only
in
the
form
of
mechanical
and
mathematical
motion
but
chiefly
in
the
form
of
an
impulse
a
vital
spirit
a
tension
or
a
to
use
a
term
of
jacob
böhme
a
of
matter
in
bacon
its
first
creator
materialism
still
occludes
within
itself
the
germs
of
a
development
on
the
one
hand
matter
surrounded
by
a
sensuous
poetic
glamour
seems
to
attract
man
whole
entity
by
winning
smiles
on
the
other
the
aphoristically
formulated
doctrine
pullulates
with
inconsistencies
imported
from
theology
in
its
further
evolution
materialism
becomes
hobbes
is
the
man
who
systematizes
baconian
materialism
knowledge
based
upon
the
senses
loses
its
poetic
blossom
it
passes
into
the
abstract
experience
of
the
mathematician
geometry
is
proclaimed
as
the
queen
of
sciences
materialism
takes
to
misanthropy
if
it
is
to
overcome
its
opponent
misanthropic
fleshless
spiritualism
and
that
on
the
latter
own
ground
materialism
has
to
chastise
its
own
flesh
and
turn
ascetic
thus
from
a
sensual
it
passes
into
an
intellectual
entity
but
thus
too
it
evolves
all
the
consistency
regardless
of
consequences
characteristic
of
the
intellect
hobbes
as
bacon
continuator
argues
thus
if
all
human
knowledge
is
furnished
by
the
senses
then
our
concepts
and
ideas
are
but
the
phantoms
divested
of
their
sensual
forms
of
the
real
world
philosophy
can
but
give
names
to
these
phantoms
one
name
may
be
applied
to
more
than
one
of
them
there
may
even
be
names
of
names
it
would
imply
a
contradiction
if
on
the
one
hand
we
maintained
that
all
ideas
had
their
origin
in
the
world
of
sensation
and
on
the
other
that
a
word
was
more
than
a
word
that
besides
the
beings
known
to
us
by
our
senses
beings
which
are
one
and
all
individuals
there
existed
also
beings
of
a
general
not
individual
nature
an
unbodily
substance
is
the
same
absurdity
as
an
unbodily
body
body
being
substance
are
but
different
terms
for
the
same
reality
is
impossible
to
separate
thought
from
matter
that
this
matter
is
the
substratum
of
all
changes
going
on
in
the
world
the
word
infinite
is
meaningless
unless
it
states
that
our
mind
is
capable
of
performing
an
endless
process
of
addition
only
material
things
being
perceptible
to
us
we
can
not
know
anything
about
the
existence
of
god
my
own
existence
alone
is
certain
every
human
passion
is
a
mechanical
movement
which
has
a
beginning
and
an
end
the
objects
of
impulse
are
what
we
call
good
man
is
subject
to
the
same
laws
as
nature
power
and
freedom
are
identical
hobbes
had
systematized
bacon
without
however
furnishing
a
proof
for
bacon
fundamental
principle
the
origin
of
all
human
knowledge
from
the
world
of
sensation
it
was
locke
who
in
his
essay
on
the
human
understanding
supplied
this
proof
hobbes
had
shattered
the
theistic
prejudices
of
baconian
materialism
collins
dodwall
coward
hartley
priestley
similarly
shattered
the
last
theological
bars
that
still
locke
sensationalism
at
all
events
for
practical
materialists
theism
is
but
an
way
of
getting
rid
of
religion
b
thus
karl
marx
wrote
about
the
british
origin
of
modern
materialism
if
englishmen
nowadays
do
not
exactly
relish
the
compliment
he
paid
their
ancestors
more
the
pity
it
is
none
the
less
undeniable
that
bacon
hobbes
and
locke
are
the
fathers
of
that
brilliant
school
of
french
materialists
which
made
the
eighteenth
century
in
spite
of
all
battles
on
land
and
sea
won
over
frenchmen
by
germans
and
englishmen
a
french
century
even
before
that
crowning
french
revolution
the
results
of
which
we
outsiders
in
england
as
well
as
in
germany
are
still
trying
to
acclimatize
there
is
no
denying
it
about
the
middle
of
this
century
what
struck
every
cultivated
foreigner
who
set
up
his
residence
in
england
was
what
he
was
then
bound
to
consider
the
religious
bigotry
and
stupidity
of
the
english
respectable
we
at
that
time
were
all
materialists
or
at
least
very
advanced
freethinkers
and
to
us
it
appeared
inconceivable
that
almost
all
educated
people
in
england
should
believe
in
all
sorts
of
impossible
miracles
and
that
even
geologists
like
buckland
and
mantell
should
contort
the
facts
of
their
science
so
as
not
to
clash
too
much
with
the
myths
of
the
book
of
genesis
while
in
order
to
find
people
who
dared
to
use
their
own
intellectual
faculties
with
regard
to
religious
matters
you
had
to
go
amongst
the
uneducated
the
great
unwashed
as
they
were
then
called
the
working
people
especially
the
owenite
socialists
but
england
has
been
civilized
since
then
the
exhibition
of
sounded
the
knell
of
english
insular
exclusiveness
england
became
gradually
internationalized
in
diet
in
manners
in
ideas
so
much
so
that
i
begin
to
wish
that
some
english
manners
and
customs
had
made
as
much
headway
on
the
continent
as
other
continental
habits
have
made
here
anyhow
the
introduction
and
spread
of
before
known
only
to
the
aristocracy
has
been
accompanied
by
a
fatal
spread
of
continental
scepticism
in
matters
religious
and
it
has
come
to
this
that
agnosticism
though
not
yet
considered
the
thing
quite
as
much
as
the
church
of
england
is
yet
very
nearly
on
a
par
as
far
as
respectability
goes
with
baptism
and
decidedly
ranks
above
the
salvation
army
and
i
can
not
help
believing
that
under
these
circumstances
it
will
be
consoling
to
many
who
sincerely
regret
and
condemn
this
progress
of
infidelity
to
learn
that
these
notions
are
not
of
foreign
origin
are
not
made
in
germany
like
so
many
other
articles
of
daily
use
but
are
undoubtedly
old
english
and
that
their
british
originators
two
hundred
years
ago
went
a
good
deal
further
than
their
descendants
now
dare
to
venture
what
indeed
is
agnosticism
but
to
use
an
expressive
lancashire
term
shamefaced
materialism
the
agnostic
conception
of
nature
is
materialistic
throughout
the
entire
natural
world
is
governed
by
law
and
absolutely
excludes
the
intervention
of
action
from
without
but
he
adds
we
have
no
means
either
of
ascertaining
or
of
disproving
the
existence
of
some
supreme
being
beyond
the
known
universe
now
this
might
hold
good
at
the
time
when
laplace
to
napoleon
question
why
in
the
great
astronomer
the
creator
was
not
even
mentioned
proudly
replied
pas
besoin
de
cette
but
nowadays
in
our
evolutionary
conception
of
the
universe
there
is
absolutely
no
room
for
either
a
creator
or
a
ruler
and
to
talk
of
a
supreme
being
shut
out
from
the
whole
existing
world
implies
a
contradiction
in
terms
and
as
it
seems
to
me
a
gratuitous
insult
to
the
feelings
of
religious
people
again
our
agnostic
admits
that
all
our
knowledge
is
based
upon
the
information
imparted
to
us
by
our
senses
but
he
adds
how
do
we
know
that
our
senses
give
us
correct
representations
of
the
objects
we
perceive
through
them
and
he
proceeds
to
inform
us
that
whenever
he
speaks
of
objects
or
their
qualities
he
does
in
reality
not
mean
these
objects
and
qualities
of
which
he
can
not
know
anything
for
certain
but
merely
the
impressions
which
they
have
produced
on
his
senses
now
this
line
of
reasoning
seems
undoubtedly
hard
to
beat
by
mere
argumentation
but
before
there
was
argumentation
there
was
action
anfang
war
die
and
human
action
had
solved
the
difficulty
long
before
human
ingenuity
invented
it
the
proof
of
the
pudding
is
in
the
eating
from
the
moment
we
turn
to
our
own
use
these
objects
according
to
the
qualities
we
perceive
in
them
we
put
to
an
infallible
test
the
correctness
or
otherwise
of
our
if
these
perceptions
have
been
wrong
then
our
estimate
of
the
use
to
which
an
object
can
be
turned
must
also
be
wrong
and
our
attempt
must
fail
but
if
we
succeed
in
accomplishing
our
aim
if
we
find
that
the
object
does
agree
with
our
idea
of
it
and
does
answer
the
purpose
we
intended
it
for
then
that
is
positive
proof
that
our
perceptions
of
it
and
of
its
qualities
agree
with
reality
outside
ourselves
and
whenever
we
find
ourselves
face
to
face
with
a
failure
then
we
generally
are
not
long
in
making
out
the
cause
that
made
us
fail
we
find
that
the
perception
upon
which
we
acted
was
either
incomplete
and
superficial
or
combined
with
the
results
of
other
perceptions
in
a
way
not
warranted
by
them
what
we
call
defective
reasoning
so
long
as
we
take
care
to
train
and
to
use
our
senses
properly
and
to
keep
our
action
within
the
limits
prescribed
by
perceptions
properly
made
and
properly
used
so
long
we
shall
find
that
the
result
of
our
action
proves
the
conformity
of
our
perceptions
with
the
objective
nature
of
the
things
perceived
not
in
one
single
instance
so
far
have
we
been
led
to
the
conclusion
that
our
scientifically
controlled
induce
in
our
minds
ideas
respecting
the
outer
world
that
are
by
their
very
nature
at
variance
with
reality
or
that
there
is
an
inherent
incompatibility
between
the
outer
world
and
our
of
it
but
then
come
the
agnostics
and
say
we
may
correctly
perceive
the
qualities
of
a
thing
but
we
can
not
by
any
sensible
or
mental
process
grasp
the
thing
in
itself
this
thing
in
itself
is
beyond
our
ken
to
this
hegel
long
since
has
replied
if
you
know
all
the
qualities
of
a
thing
you
know
the
thing
itself
nothing
remains
but
the
fact
that
the
said
thing
exists
without
us
and
when
your
senses
have
taught
you
that
fact
you
have
grasped
the
last
remnant
of
the
thing
in
itself
kant
celebrated
unknowable
an
to
which
it
may
be
added
that
in
kant
time
our
knowledge
of
natural
objects
was
indeed
so
fragmentary
that
he
might
well
suspect
behind
the
little
we
knew
about
each
of
them
a
mysterious
thing
in
itself
but
one
after
another
these
ungraspable
things
have
been
grasped
analyzed
and
what
is
more
by
the
giant
progress
of
science
and
what
we
can
produce
we
certainly
can
not
consider
as
unknowable
to
the
chemistry
of
the
first
half
of
this
century
organic
substances
were
such
mysterious
objects
now
we
learn
to
build
them
up
one
after
another
from
their
chemical
elements
without
the
aid
of
organic
processes
modern
chemists
declare
that
as
soon
as
the
chemical
constitution
of
no
matter
what
body
is
known
it
can
be
built
up
from
its
elements
we
are
still
far
from
knowing
the
constitution
of
the
highest
organic
substances
the
albuminous
bodies
but
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
if
only
after
centuries
arrive
at
that
knowledge
and
armed
with
it
produce
artificial
albumen
but
if
we
arrive
at
that
we
shall
at
the
same
time
have
produced
organic
life
for
life
from
its
lowest
to
its
highest
forms
is
but
the
normal
mode
of
existence
of
albuminous
bodies
as
soon
however
as
our
agnostic
has
made
these
formal
mental
reservations
he
talks
and
acts
as
the
rank
materialist
he
at
bottom
is
he
may
say
that
as
far
as
know
matter
and
motion
or
as
it
is
now
called
energy
can
neither
be
created
nor
destroyed
but
that
we
have
no
proof
of
their
not
having
been
created
at
some
time
or
other
but
if
you
try
to
use
this
admission
against
him
in
any
particular
case
he
will
quickly
put
you
out
of
court
if
he
admits
the
possibility
of
spiritualism
he
will
have
none
of
it
as
far
as
we
know
and
can
know
he
will
tell
you
there
is
no
creator
and
no
ruler
of
the
universe
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
matter
and
energy
can
neither
be
created
nor
annihilated
for
us
mind
is
a
mode
of
energy
a
function
of
the
brain
all
we
know
is
that
the
material
world
is
governed
by
immutable
laws
and
so
forth
thus
as
far
as
he
is
a
scientific
man
as
far
as
he
anything
he
is
a
materialist
outside
his
science
in
spheres
about
which
he
knows
nothing
he
translates
his
ignorance
into
greek
and
calls
it
agnosticism
at
all
events
one
thing
seems
clear
even
if
i
was
an
agnostic
it
is
evident
that
i
could
not
describe
the
conception
of
history
sketched
out
in
this
little
book
as
historical
agnosticism
religious
people
would
laugh
at
me
agnostics
would
indignantly
ask
was
i
going
to
make
fun
of
them
and
thus
i
hope
even
british
respectability
will
not
be
overshocked
if
i
use
in
english
as
well
as
in
so
many
other
languages
the
term
historical
materialism
to
designate
that
view
of
the
course
of
history
which
seeks
the
ultimate
cause
and
the
great
moving
power
of
all
important
historic
events
in
the
economic
development
of
society
in
the
changes
in
the
modes
of
production
and
exchange
in
the
consequent
division
of
society
into
distinct
classes
and
in
the
struggles
of
these
classes
against
one
another
this
indulgence
will
perhaps
be
accorded
to
me
all
the
sooner
if
i
show
that
historical
materialism
may
be
of
advantage
even
to
british
respectability
i
have
mentioned
the
fact
that
about
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
any
cultivated
foreigner
settling
in
england
was
struck
by
what
he
was
then
bound
to
consider
the
religious
bigotry
and
stupidity
of
the
english
respectable
i
am
now
going
to
prove
that
the
respectable
english
of
that
time
was
not
quite
as
stupid
as
it
looked
to
the
intelligent
foreigner
its
religious
leanings
can
be
explained
when
europe
emerged
from
the
middle
ages
the
rising
of
the
towns
constituted
its
revolutionary
element
it
had
conquered
a
recognized
position
within
mediæval
feudal
organization
but
this
position
also
had
become
too
narrow
for
its
expansive
power
the
development
of
the
the
became
incompatible
with
the
maintenance
of
the
feudal
system
the
feudal
system
therefore
had
to
fall
but
the
great
international
center
of
feudalism
was
the
roman
catholic
church
it
united
the
whole
of
feudalized
western
europe
in
spite
of
all
internal
wars
into
one
grand
political
system
opposed
as
much
to
the
schismatic
greeks
as
to
the
mohammedian
countries
it
surrounded
feudal
institutions
with
the
halo
of
divine
consecration
it
had
organized
its
own
hierarchy
on
the
feudal
model
and
lastly
it
was
itself
by
far
the
most
powerful
feudal
lord
holding
as
it
did
fully
of
the
soil
of
the
catholic
world
before
profane
feudalism
could
be
successively
attacked
in
each
country
and
in
detail
this
its
sacred
central
organization
had
to
be
destroyed
moreover
parallel
with
the
rise
of
the
went
on
the
great
revival
of
science
astronomy
mechanics
physics
anatomy
physiology
were
again
cultivated
and
the
bourgeoisie
for
the
development
of
its
industrial
production
required
a
science
which
ascertained
the
physical
properties
of
natural
objects
and
the
modes
of
action
of
the
forces
of
nature
now
up
to
then
science
had
but
been
the
humble
handmaid
of
the
church
had
not
been
allowed
to
overstep
the
limits
set
by
faith
and
for
that
reason
had
been
no
science
at
all
science
rebelled
against
the
church
the
bourgeoisie
could
not
do
without
science
and
therefore
had
to
join
in
the
rebellion
the
above
though
touching
but
two
of
the
points
where
the
rising
was
bound
to
come
into
collision
with
the
established
religion
will
be
sufficient
to
show
first
that
the
class
most
directly
interested
in
the
struggle
against
the
pretensions
of
the
roman
church
was
the
bourgeoisie
and
second
that
every
struggle
against
feudalism
at
that
time
had
to
take
on
a
religious
disguise
had
to
be
directed
against
the
church
in
the
first
instance
but
if
the
universities
and
the
traders
of
the
cities
started
the
cry
it
was
sure
to
find
and
did
find
a
strong
echo
in
the
masses
of
the
country
people
the
peasants
who
everywhere
had
to
struggle
for
their
very
existence
with
their
feudal
lords
spiritual
and
temporal
the
long
fight
of
the
bourgeoisie
against
feudalism
culminated
in
three
great
decisive
battles
the
first
was
what
is
called
the
protestant
reformation
in
germany
the
raised
against
the
church
by
luther
was
responded
to
by
two
insurrections
of
a
political
nature
first
that
of
the
lower
nobility
under
franz
von
sickingen
then
the
great
war
both
were
defeated
chiefly
in
consequence
of
the
indecision
of
the
parties
most
interested
the
burghers
of
the
towns
an
indecision
into
the
causes
of
which
we
can
not
here
enter
from
that
moment
the
struggle
degenerated
into
a
fight
between
the
local
princes
and
the
central
power
and
ended
by
blotting
out
germany
for
two
hundred
years
from
the
politically
active
nations
of
europe
the
lutheran
reformation
produced
a
new
creed
indeed
a
religion
adapted
to
absolute
monarchy
no
sooner
were
the
peasants
of
germany
converted
to
lutheranism
than
they
were
from
freemen
reduced
to
serfs
but
where
luther
failed
calvin
won
the
day
calvin
creed
was
one
fit
for
the
boldest
of
the
bourgeoisie
of
his
time
his
predestination
doctrine
was
the
religious
expression
of
the
fact
that
in
the
commercial
world
of
competition
success
or
failure
does
not
depend
upon
a
man
activity
or
cleverness
but
upon
circumstances
uncontrollable
by
him
it
is
not
of
him
that
willeth
or
of
him
that
runneth
but
of
the
mercy
of
unknown
superior
economic
powers
and
this
was
especially
true
at
a
period
of
economic
revolution
when
all
old
commercial
routes
and
centers
were
replaced
by
new
ones
when
india
and
america
were
opened
to
the
world
and
when
even
the
most
sacred
economic
articles
of
faith
the
value
of
gold
and
silver
began
to
totter
and
to
break
down
calvin
church
constitution
was
thoroughly
democratic
and
republican
and
where
the
kingdom
of
god
was
republicanized
could
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
remain
subject
to
monarchs
bishops
and
lords
while
german
lutheranism
became
a
willing
tool
in
the
hands
of
princes
calvinism
founded
a
republic
in
holland
and
active
republican
parties
in
england
and
above
all
scotland
in
calvinism
the
second
great
bourgeois
upheaval
found
its
doctrine
ready
cut
and
dried
this
upheaval
took
place
in
england
the
of
the
towns
brought
it
on
and
the
yeomanry
of
the
country
districts
fought
it
out
curiously
enough
in
all
the
three
great
bourgeois
risings
the
peasantry
furnishes
the
army
that
has
to
do
the
fighting
and
the
peasantry
is
just
the
class
that
the
victory
once
gained
is
most
surely
ruined
by
the
economic
consequences
of
that
victory
a
hundred
years
after
cromwell
the
yeomanry
of
england
had
almost
disappeared
anyhow
had
it
not
been
for
that
yeomanry
and
for
the
element
in
the
towns
the
bourgeoisie
alone
would
never
have
fought
the
matter
out
to
the
bitter
end
and
would
never
have
brought
charles
to
the
scaffold
in
order
to
secure
even
those
conquests
of
the
bourgeoisie
that
were
ripe
for
gathering
at
the
time
the
revolution
had
to
be
carried
considerably
further
exactly
as
in
in
france
and
in
germany
this
seems
in
fact
to
be
one
of
the
laws
of
evolution
of
bourgeois
society
well
upon
this
excess
of
revolutionary
activity
there
necessarily
followed
the
inevitable
reaction
which
in
its
turn
went
beyond
the
point
where
it
might
have
maintained
itself
after
a
series
of
oscillations
the
new
center
of
gravity
was
at
last
attained
and
became
a
new
the
grand
period
of
english
history
known
to
respectability
under
the
name
of
the
great
rebellion
and
the
struggles
succeeding
it
were
brought
to
a
close
by
the
comparatively
puny
event
entitled
by
liberal
historians
the
glorious
revolution
the
new
was
a
compromise
between
the
rising
and
the
landowners
the
latter
though
called
as
now
the
aristocracy
had
been
long
since
on
the
way
which
led
them
to
become
what
louis
philippe
in
france
became
at
a
much
later
period
the
first
bourgeois
of
the
kingdom
fortunately
for
england
the
old
feudal
barons
had
killed
one
another
during
the
wars
of
the
roses
their
successors
though
mostly
scions
of
the
old
families
had
been
so
much
out
of
the
direct
line
of
descent
that
they
constituted
quite
a
new
body
with
habits
and
tendencies
far
more
bourgeois
than
feudal
they
fully
understood
the
value
of
money
and
at
once
began
to
increase
their
rents
by
turning
hundreds
of
small
farmers
out
and
replacing
them
by
sheep
henry
while
squandering
the
church
lands
created
fresh
bourgeois
landlords
by
wholesale
the
innumerable
confiscations
of
estates
regranted
to
absolute
or
relative
upstarts
and
continued
during
the
whole
of
the
seventeenth
century
had
the
same
result
consequently
ever
since
henry
the
english
aristocracy
far
from
counteracting
the
development
of
industrial
production
had
on
the
contrary
sought
to
indirectly
profit
thereby
and
there
had
always
been
a
section
of
the
great
landowners
willing
from
economical
or
political
reasons
to
with
the
leading
men
of
the
financial
and
industrial
bourgeoisie
the
compromise
of
was
therefore
easily
accomplished
the
political
spoils
of
pelf
and
place
were
left
to
the
great
families
provided
the
economic
interests
of
the
financial
manufacturing
and
commercial
were
sufficiently
attended
to
and
these
economic
interests
were
at
that
time
powerful
enough
to
determine
the
general
policy
of
the
nation
there
might
be
squabbles
about
matters
of
detail
but
on
the
whole
the
aristocratic
oligarchy
knew
too
well
that
its
own
economic
prosperity
was
irretrievably
bound
up
with
that
of
the
industrial
and
commercial
from
that
time
the
bourgeoisie
was
a
humble
but
still
a
recognized
component
of
the
ruling
classes
of
england
with
the
rest
of
them
it
had
a
common
interest
in
keeping
in
subjection
the
great
working
mass
of
the
nation
the
merchant
or
manufacturer
himself
stood
in
the
position
of
master
or
as
it
was
until
lately
called
of
natural
superior
to
his
clerks
his
workpeople
his
domestic
servants
his
interest
was
to
get
as
much
and
as
good
work
out
of
them
as
he
could
for
this
end
they
had
to
be
trained
to
proper
submission
he
was
himself
religious
his
religion
had
supplied
the
standard
under
which
he
had
fought
the
king
and
the
lords
he
was
not
long
in
discovering
the
opportunities
this
same
religion
offered
him
for
working
upon
the
minds
of
his
natural
inferiors
and
making
them
submissive
to
the
behests
of
the
masters
it
had
pleased
god
to
place
over
them
in
short
the
english
bourgeoisie
now
had
to
take
a
part
in
keeping
down
the
lower
orders
the
great
producing
mass
of
the
nation
and
one
of
the
means
employed
for
that
purpose
was
the
influence
of
religion
there
was
another
fact
that
contributed
to
strengthen
the
religious
leanings
of
the
bourgeoisie
that
was
the
rise
of
materialism
in
england
this
new
doctrine
not
only
shocked
the
pious
feelings
of
the
it
announced
itself
as
a
philosophy
only
fit
for
scholars
and
cultivated
men
of
the
world
in
contrast
to
religion
which
was
good
enough
for
the
uneducated
masses
including
the
bourgeoisie
with
hobbes
it
stepped
on
the
stage
as
a
defender
of
royal
prerogative
and
omnipotence
it
called
upon
absolute
monarchy
to
keep
down
that
robustus
sed
to
wit
the
people
similarly
with
the
successors
of
hobbes
with
bolingbroke
shaftesbury
the
new
deistic
form
of
materialism
remained
an
aristocratic
esoteric
doctrine
and
therefore
hateful
to
the
both
for
its
religious
heresy
and
for
its
political
connections
accordingly
in
opposition
to
the
materialism
and
deism
of
the
aristocracy
those
protestant
sects
which
had
furnished
the
flag
and
the
fighting
contingent
against
the
stuarts
continued
to
furnish
the
main
strength
of
the
progressive
and
form
even
the
backbone
of
the
great
liberal
party
in
the
meantime
materialism
passed
from
england
to
france
where
it
met
and
coalesced
with
another
materialistic
school
of
philosophers
a
branch
of
cartesianism
in
france
too
it
remained
at
first
an
exclusively
aristocratic
doctrine
but
soon
its
revolutionary
character
asserted
itself
the
french
materialists
did
not
limit
their
criticism
to
matters
of
religious
belief
they
extended
it
to
whatever
scientific
tradition
or
political
institution
they
met
with
and
to
prove
the
claim
of
their
doctrine
to
universal
application
they
took
the
shortest
cut
and
boldly
applied
it
to
all
subjects
of
knowledge
in
the
giant
work
after
which
they
were
named
the
thus
in
one
or
the
other
of
its
two
forms
avowed
materialism
or
deism
it
became
the
creed
of
the
whole
cultured
youth
of
france
so
much
so
that
when
the
great
revolution
broke
out
the
doctrine
hatched
by
english
royalists
gave
a
theoretical
flag
to
french
republicans
and
terrorists
and
furnished
the
text
for
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
the
great
french
revolution
was
the
third
uprising
of
the
bourgeoisie
but
the
first
that
had
entirely
cast
off
the
religious
cloak
and
was
fought
out
on
undisguised
political
lines
it
was
the
first
too
that
was
really
fought
out
to
the
destruction
of
one
of
the
combatants
the
aristocracy
and
the
complete
triumph
of
the
other
the
bourgeoisie
in
england
the
continuity
of
and
institutions
and
the
compromise
between
landlords
and
capitalists
found
its
expression
in
the
continuity
of
judicial
precedents
and
in
the
religious
preservation
of
the
feudal
forms
of
the
law
in
france
the
revolution
constituted
a
complete
breach
with
the
traditions
of
the
past
it
cleared
out
the
very
last
vestiges
of
feudalism
and
created
in
the
a
masterly
adaptation
of
the
old
roman
law
that
almost
perfect
expression
of
the
juridical
relations
corresponding
to
the
economic
stage
called
by
marx
the
production
of
commodities
to
modern
capitalistic
conditions
so
masterly
that
this
french
revolutionary
code
still
serves
as
a
model
for
reforms
of
the
law
of
property
in
all
other
countries
not
excepting
england
let
us
however
not
forget
that
if
english
law
continues
to
express
the
economic
relations
of
capitalistic
society
in
that
barbarous
feudal
language
which
corresponds
to
the
thing
expressed
just
as
english
spelling
corresponds
to
english
pronunciation
écrivez
londres
et
vous
prononcez
said
a
frenchman
that
same
english
law
is
the
only
one
which
has
preserved
through
ages
and
transmitted
to
america
and
the
colonies
the
best
part
of
that
old
germanic
personal
freedom
local
and
independence
from
all
interference
but
that
of
the
law
courts
which
on
the
continent
has
been
lost
during
the
period
of
absolute
monarchy
and
has
nowhere
been
as
yet
fully
recovered
to
return
to
our
british
bourgeois
the
french
revolution
gave
him
a
splendid
opportunity
with
the
help
of
the
continental
monarchies
to
destroy
french
maritime
commerce
to
annex
french
colonies
and
to
crush
the
last
french
pretensions
to
maritime
rivalry
that
was
one
reason
why
he
fought
it
another
was
that
the
ways
of
this
revolution
went
very
much
against
his
grain
not
only
its
execrable
terrorism
but
the
very
attempt
to
carry
bourgeois
rule
to
extremes
what
should
the
british
bourgeois
do
without
his
aristocracy
that
taught
him
manners
such
as
they
were
and
invented
fashions
for
him
that
furnished
officers
for
the
army
which
kept
order
at
home
and
the
navy
which
conquered
colonial
possessions
and
new
markets
abroad
there
was
indeed
a
progressive
minority
of
the
bourgeoisie
that
minority
whose
interests
were
not
so
well
attended
to
under
the
compromise
this
section
composed
chiefly
of
the
less
wealthy
did
sympathize
with
the
revolution
but
it
was
powerless
in
parliament
thus
if
materialism
became
the
creed
of
the
french
revolution
the
english
bourgeois
held
all
the
faster
to
his
religion
had
not
the
reign
of
terror
in
paris
proved
what
was
the
upshot
if
the
religious
instincts
of
the
masses
were
lost
the
more
materialism
spread
from
france
to
neighboring
countries
and
was
reinforced
by
similar
doctrinal
currents
notably
by
german
philosophy
the
more
in
fact
materialism
and
freethought
generally
became
on
the
continent
the
necessary
qualifications
of
a
cultivated
man
the
more
stubbornly
the
english
stuck
to
its
manifold
religious
creeds
these
creeds
might
differ
from
one
another
but
they
were
all
of
them
distinctly
religious
christian
creeds
while
the
revolution
ensured
the
political
triumph
of
the
bourgeoisie
in
france
in
england
watt
arkwright
cartwright
and
others
initiated
an
industrial
revolution
which
completely
shifted
the
center
of
gravity
of
economic
power
the
wealth
of
the
bourgeoisie
increased
considerably
faster
than
that
of
the
landed
aristocracy
within
the
bourgeoisie
itself
the
financial
aristocracy
the
bankers
were
more
and
more
pushed
into
the
background
by
the
manufacturers
the
compromise
of
even
after
the
gradual
changes
it
had
undergone
in
favor
of
the
bourgeoisie
no
longer
corresponded
to
the
relative
position
of
the
parties
to
it
the
character
of
these
parties
too
had
changed
the
bourgeoisie
of
was
very
different
from
that
of
the
preceding
century
the
political
power
still
left
to
the
aristocracy
and
used
by
them
to
resist
the
pretensions
of
the
new
industrial
bourgeoisie
became
incompatible
with
the
new
economic
interests
a
fresh
struggle
with
the
aristocracy
was
necessary
it
could
end
only
in
a
victory
of
the
new
economic
power
first
the
reform
act
was
pushed
through
in
spite
of
all
resistance
under
the
impulse
of
the
french
revolution
of
it
gave
to
the
bourgeoisie
a
recognized
and
powerful
place
in
parliament
then
the
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
which
settled
once
for
all
the
supremacy
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
especially
of
its
most
active
portion
the
manufacturers
over
the
landed
aristocracy
this
was
the
greatest
victory
of
the
bourgeoisie
it
was
however
also
the
last
it
gained
in
its
own
exclusive
interest
whatever
triumphs
it
obtained
later
on
it
had
to
share
with
a
new
social
power
first
its
ally
but
soon
its
rival
the
industrial
revolution
had
created
a
class
of
large
manufacturing
capitalists
but
also
a
class
and
a
far
more
numerous
one
of
manufacturing
this
class
gradually
increased
in
numbers
in
proportion
as
the
industrial
revolution
seized
upon
one
branch
of
manufacture
after
another
and
in
the
same
proportion
it
increased
in
power
this
power
it
proved
as
early
as
by
forcing
a
reluctant
parliament
to
repeal
the
acts
forbidding
combinations
of
workmen
during
the
reform
agitation
the
constituted
the
radical
wing
of
the
reform
party
the
act
of
having
excluded
them
from
the
suffrage
they
formulated
their
demands
in
the
people
charter
and
constituted
themselves
in
opposition
to
the
great
bourgeois
law
party
into
an
independent
party
the
chartists
the
first
party
of
modern
times
then
came
the
continental
revolutions
of
february
and
march
in
which
the
working
people
played
such
a
prominent
part
and
at
least
in
paris
put
forward
demands
which
were
certainly
inadmissible
from
the
point
of
view
of
capitalistic
society
and
then
came
the
general
reaction
first
the
defeat
of
the
chartists
on
the
april
then
the
crushing
of
the
paris
insurrection
in
june
of
the
same
year
then
the
disasters
of
in
italy
hungary
south
germany
and
at
last
the
victory
of
louis
bonaparte
over
paris
december
for
a
time
at
least
the
bugbear
of
pretensions
was
put
down
but
at
what
cost
if
the
british
bourgeois
had
been
convinced
before
of
the
necessity
of
maintaining
the
common
people
in
a
religious
mood
how
much
more
must
he
feel
that
necessity
after
all
these
experiences
regardless
of
the
sneers
of
his
continental
compeers
he
continued
to
spend
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
year
after
year
upon
the
evangelization
of
the
lower
orders
not
content
with
his
own
native
religious
machinery
he
appealed
to
brother
jonathan
the
greatest
organizer
in
existence
of
religion
as
a
trade
and
imported
from
america
revivalism
moody
and
sankey
and
the
like
and
finally
he
accepted
the
dangerous
aid
of
the
salvation
army
which
revives
the
propaganda
of
early
christianity
appeals
to
the
poor
as
the
elect
fights
capitalism
in
a
religious
way
and
thus
fosters
an
element
of
early
christian
class
antagonism
which
one
day
may
become
troublesome
to
the
people
who
now
find
the
ready
money
for
it
it
seems
a
law
of
historical
development
that
the
bourgeoisie
can
in
no
european
country
get
hold
of
political
power
at
least
for
any
length
of
time
in
the
same
exclusive
way
in
which
the
feudal
aristocracy
kept
hold
of
it
during
the
middle
ages
even
in
france
where
feudalism
was
completely
extinguished
the
bourgeoisie
as
a
whole
has
held
full
possession
of
the
government
for
very
short
periods
only
during
louis
philippe
reign
a
very
small
portion
of
the
bourgeoisie
ruled
the
kingdom
by
far
the
larger
part
were
excluded
from
the
suffrage
by
the
high
qualification
under
the
second
republic
the
whole
bourgeoisie
ruled
but
for
three
years
only
their
incapacity
brought
on
the
second
empire
it
is
only
now
in
the
third
republic
that
the
bourgeoisie
as
a
whole
have
kept
possession
of
the
helm
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
they
are
already
showing
lively
signs
of
decadence
a
durable
reign
of
the
bourgeoisie
has
been
possible
only
in
countries
like
america
where
feudalism
was
unknown
and
society
at
the
very
beginning
started
from
a
bourgeois
basis
and
even
in
france
and
america
the
successors
of
the
bourgeoisie
the
working
people
are
already
knocking
at
the
door
in
england
the
bourgeoisie
never
held
undivided
sway
even
the
victory
of
left
the
landed
aristocracy
in
almost
exclusive
possession
of
all
the
leading
government
offices
the
meekness
with
which
the
wealthy
submitted
to
this
remained
inconceivable
to
me
until
the
great
liberal
manufacturer
forster
in
a
public
speech
implored
the
young
men
of
bradford
to
learn
french
as
a
means
to
get
on
in
the
world
and
quoted
from
his
own
experience
how
sheepish
he
looked
when
as
a
cabinet
minister
he
had
to
move
in
society
where
french
was
at
least
as
necessary
as
english
the
fact
was
the
english
of
that
time
were
as
a
rule
quite
uneducated
upstarts
and
could
not
help
leaving
to
the
aristocracy
those
superior
government
places
where
other
qualifications
were
required
than
mere
insular
narrowness
and
insular
conceit
seasoned
by
business
sharpness
c
even
now
the
endless
newspaper
debates
about
education
show
that
the
english
does
not
yet
consider
itself
good
enough
for
the
best
education
and
looks
to
something
more
modest
thus
even
after
the
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
it
appeared
a
matter
of
course
that
the
men
who
had
carried
the
day
the
cobdens
brights
forsters
should
remain
excluded
from
a
share
in
the
official
government
of
the
country
until
twenty
years
afterwards
a
new
reform
act
opened
to
them
the
door
of
the
cabinet
the
english
bourgeoisie
are
up
to
the
present
day
so
deeply
penetrated
by
a
sense
of
their
social
inferiority
that
they
keep
up
at
their
own
expense
and
that
of
the
nation
an
ornamental
caste
of
drones
to
represent
the
nation
worthily
at
all
state
functions
and
they
consider
themselves
highly
honored
whenever
one
of
themselves
is
found
worthy
of
admission
into
this
select
and
privileged
body
manufactured
after
all
by
themselves
the
industrial
and
commercial
had
therefore
not
yet
succeeded
in
driving
the
landed
aristocracy
completely
from
political
power
when
another
competitor
the
appeared
on
the
stage
the
reaction
after
the
chartist
movement
and
the
continental
revolutions
as
well
as
the
unparalleled
extension
of
english
trade
from
ascribed
vulgarly
to
free
trade
alone
but
due
far
more
to
the
colossal
development
of
railways
ocean
steamers
and
means
of
intercourse
generally
had
again
driven
the
into
the
dependency
of
the
liberal
party
of
which
they
formed
as
in
times
the
radical
wing
their
claims
to
the
franchise
however
gradually
became
irresistible
while
the
whig
leaders
of
the
liberals
funked
disraeli
showed
his
superiority
by
making
the
tories
seize
the
favorable
moment
and
introduce
household
suffrage
in
the
boroughs
along
with
a
redistribution
of
seats
then
followed
the
ballot
then
in
the
extension
of
household
suffrage
to
the
counties
and
a
fresh
redistribution
of
seats
by
which
electoral
districts
were
to
some
extent
equalized
all
these
measures
considerably
increased
the
electoral
power
of
the
so
much
so
that
in
at
least
to
constituencies
that
class
now
furnishes
the
majority
of
voters
but
parliamentary
government
is
a
capital
school
for
teaching
respect
for
tradition
if
the
look
with
awe
and
veneration
upon
what
lord
john
manners
playfully
called
our
old
nobility
the
mass
of
the
then
looked
up
with
respect
and
deference
to
what
used
to
be
designated
as
their
betters
the
indeed
the
british
workman
some
fifteen
years
ago
was
the
model
workman
whose
respectful
regard
for
the
position
of
his
master
and
whose
modesty
in
claiming
rights
for
himself
consoled
our
german
economists
of
the
school
for
the
incurable
communistic
and
revolutionary
tendencies
of
their
own
at
home
but
the
english
the
good
men
of
business
as
they
are
saw
farther
than
the
german
professors
they
had
shared
their
power
but
reluctantly
with
the
they
had
learnt
during
the
chartist
years
what
that
robustus
sed
the
people
is
capable
of
and
since
that
time
they
had
been
compelled
to
incorporate
the
better
part
of
the
people
charter
in
the
statutes
of
the
united
kingdom
now
if
ever
the
people
must
be
kept
in
order
by
moral
means
and
the
first
and
foremost
of
all
moral
means
of
action
upon
the
masses
is
and
remains
religion
hence
the
majorities
on
the
school
boards
hence
the
increasing
of
the
bourgeoisie
for
the
support
of
all
sorts
of
revivalism
from
ritualism
to
the
salvation
army
and
now
came
the
triumph
of
british
respectability
over
the
freethought
and
religious
laxity
of
the
continental
bourgeois
the
workmen
of
france
and
germany
had
become
rebellious
they
were
thoroughly
infected
with
socialism
and
for
very
good
reasons
were
not
at
all
particular
as
to
the
legality
of
the
means
by
which
to
secure
their
own
ascendency
the
here
turned
from
day
to
day
more
nothing
remained
to
the
french
and
german
bourgeoisie
as
a
last
resource
but
to
silently
drop
their
freethought
as
a
youngster
when
creeps
upon
him
quietly
drops
the
burning
cigar
he
brought
swaggeringly
on
board
one
by
one
the
scoffers
turned
pious
in
outward
behavior
spoke
with
respect
of
the
church
its
dogmas
and
rites
and
even
conformed
with
the
latter
as
far
as
could
not
be
helped
french
bourgeoisie
dined
on
fridays
and
german
ones
sat
out
long
protestant
sermons
in
their
pews
on
sundays
they
had
come
to
grief
with
materialism
religion
muss
dem
volk
erhalten
religion
must
be
kept
alive
for
the
people
that
was
the
only
and
the
last
means
to
save
society
from
utter
ruin
unfortunately
for
themselves
they
did
not
find
this
out
until
they
had
done
their
level
best
to
break
up
religion
for
ever
and
now
it
was
the
turn
of
the
british
bourgeois
to
sneer
and
to
say
why
you
fools
i
could
have
told
you
that
two
hundred
years
ago
however
i
am
afraid
neither
the
religious
stolidity
of
the
british
nor
the
conversion
of
the
continental
bourgeois
will
stem
the
rising
proletarian
tide
tradition
is
a
great
retarding
force
is
the
of
history
but
being
merely
passive
is
sure
to
be
broken
down
and
thus
religion
will
be
no
lasting
safeguard
to
capitalist
society
if
our
juridical
philosophical
and
religious
ideas
are
the
more
or
less
remote
offshoots
of
the
economical
relations
prevailing
in
a
given
society
such
ideas
can
not
in
the
long
run
withstand
the
effects
of
a
complete
change
in
these
relations
and
unless
we
believe
in
supernatural
revelation
we
must
admit
that
no
religious
tenets
will
ever
suffice
to
prop
up
a
tottering
society
in
fact
in
england
too
the
have
begun
to
move
again
they
are
no
doubt
shackled
by
traditions
of
various
kinds
bourgeois
traditions
such
as
the
widespread
belief
that
there
can
be
but
two
parties
conservatives
and
liberals
and
that
the
must
work
out
its
salvation
by
and
through
the
great
liberal
party
traditions
inherited
from
their
first
tentative
efforts
at
independent
action
such
as
the
exclusion
from
ever
so
many
old
trade
unions
of
all
applicants
who
have
not
gone
through
a
regular
apprenticeship
which
means
the
breeding
by
every
such
union
of
its
own
blacklegs
but
for
all
that
the
english
is
moving
as
even
professor
brentano
has
sorrowfully

to
report
to

moves
like
all
things
in

with
a
slow
and
measured
step
with
hesitation
here
with
more
or
less
unfruitful
tentative
attempts
there
it
moves
now
and
then
with
an
mistrust
of
the
name
of
socialism
while
it
gradually
absorbs
the
substance
and
the
movement
spreads
and
seizes
one
layer
of
the
workers
after
another
it
has
now
shaken
out
of
their
torpor
the
unskilled
laborers
of
the
east
end
of
london
and
we
all
know
what
a
splendid
impulse
these
fresh
forces
have
given
it
in
return
and
if
the
pace
of
the
movement
is
not
up
to
the
impatience
of
some
people
let
them
not
forget
that
it
is
the
which
keeps
alive
the
finest
qualities
of
the
english
character
and
that
if
a
step
in
advance
is
once
gained
in
england
it
is
as
a
rule
never
lost
afterwards
if
the
sons
of
the
old
chartists
for
reasons
explained
above
were
not
quite
up
to
the
mark
the
grandsons
bid
fair
to
be
worthy
of
their
forefathers
but
the
triumph
of
the
european
does
not
depend
upon
england
alone
it
can
only
be
secured
by
the
of
at
least
england
france
and
germany
in
both
the
latter
countries
the
movement
is
well
ahead
of
england
in
germany
it
is
even
within
measurable
distance
of
success
the
progress
it
has
there
made
during
the
last
years
is
unparalleled
it
advances
with
velocity
if
the
german
have
shown
themselves
lamentably
deficient
in
political
capacity
discipline
courage
energy
and
perseverance
the
german
have
given
ample
proof
of
all
these
qualities
four
hundred
years
ago
germany
was
the
of
the
first
upheaval
of
the
european
as
things
are
now
is
it
outside
the
limits
of
possibility
that
germany
will
be
the

the
conceit
of
national
chauvinism
is
but
a
sorry
adviser
up
to
quite
recently
the
average
english
manufacturer
considered
it
derogatory
from
an
englishman
to
speak
any
language
but
his
own
and
felt
rather
proud
than
otherwise
of
the
fact
that
poor
devils
of
foreigners
settled
in
england
and
took
off
his
hands
the
trouble
of
disposing
of
his
products
abroad
he
never
noticed
that
these
foreigners
mostly
germans
thus
got
command
of
a
very
large
part
of
british
foreign
trade
imports
and
exports
and
that
the
direct
foreign
trade
of
englishmen
became
limited
almost
entirely
to
the
colonies
china
the
united
states
and
south
america
nor
did
he
notice
that
these
germans
traded
with
other
germans
abroad
who
gradually
organized
a
complete
network
of
commercial
colonies
all
over
the
world
but
when
germany
about
forty
years
ago
seriously
began
manufacturing
for
export
this
network
served
her
admirably
in
her
transformation
in
so
short
a
time
from
a
into
a
manufacturing
country
then
about
ten
years
ago
the
british
manufacturer
got
frightened
and
asked
his
ambassadors
and
consuls
how
it
was
that
he
could
no
longer
keep
his
customers
together
the
unanimous
answer
was
you
do
learn
your
customer
language
but
expect
him
to
speak
your
own
you
even
try
to
suit
your
customer
wants

to

socialism
utopian

i
modern
socialism
is
in
its
essence
the
direct
product
of
the
recognition
on
the
one
hand
of
the
class
antagonisms
existing
in
the
society
of
between
proprietors
and
between
capitalists
and
on
the
other
hand
of
the
anarchy
existing
in
production
but
in
its
theoretical
form
modern
socialism
originally
appears
ostensibly
as
a
more
logical
extension
of
the
principles
laid
down
by
the
great
french
philosophers
of
the
eighteenth
century
like
every
new
theory
modern
socialism
had
at
first
to
connect
itself
with
the
intellectual
ready
to
its
hand
however
deeply
its
roots
lay
in
material
economic
facts
the
great
men
who
in
france
prepared
men
minds
for
the
coming
revolution
were
themselves
extreme
revolutionists
they
recognized
no
external
authority
of
any
kind
whatever
religion
natural
science
society
political
institutions
everything
was
subjected
to
the
most
unsparing
criticism
everything
must
justify
its
existence
before
the
of
reason
or
give
up
existence
reason
became
the
sole
measure
of
everything
it
was
the
time
when
as
hegel
says
the
world
stood
upon
its
head
first
in
the
sense
that
the
human
head
and
the
principles
arrived
at
by
its
thought
claimed
to
be
the
basis
of
all
human
action
and
association
but
by
and
by
also
in
the
wider
sense
that
the
reality
which
was
in
contradiction
to
these
principles
had
in
fact
to
be
turned
upside
down
every
form
of
society
and
government
then
existing
every
old
traditional
notion
was
flung
into
the
as
irrational
the
world
had
hitherto
allowed
itself
to
be
led
solely
by
prejudices
everything
in
the
past
deserved
only
pity
and
contempt
now
for
the
first
time
appeared
the
light
of
day
the
kingdom
of
reason
henceforth
superstition
injustice
privilege
oppression
were
to
be
superseded
by
eternal
truth
eternal
right
equality
based
on
nature
and
the
inalienable
rights
of
man
we
know
that
this
kingdom
of
reason
was
nothing
more
than
the
idealized
kingdom
of
the
bourgeoisie
that
this
eternal
right
found
its
realization
in
bourgeois
justice
that
this
equality
reduced
itself
to
bourgeois
equality
before
the
law
that
bourgeois
property
was
proclaimed
as
one
of
the
essential
rights
of
man
and
that
the
government
of
reason
the
contrat
social
of
rousseau
came
into
being
and
only
could
come
into
being
as
a
democratic
bourgeois
republic
the
great
thinkers
of
the
eighteenth
century
could
no
more
than
their
predecessors
go
beyond
the
limits
imposed
upon
them
by
their
epoch
but
side
by
side
with
the
antagonism
of
the
feudal
nobility
and
the
burghers
who
claimed
to
represent
all
the
rest
of
society
was
the
general
antagonism
of
exploiters
and
exploited
of
rich
idlers
and
poor
workers
it
was
this
very
circumstance
that
made
it
possible
for
the
representatives
of
the
bourgeoisie
to
put
themselves
forward
as
representing
not
one
special
class
but
the
whole
of
suffering
humanity
still
further
from
its
origin
the
bourgeoisie
was
saddled
with
its
antithesis
capitalists
can
not
exist
without
and
in
the
same
proportion
as
the
mediæval
burgher
of
the
guild
developed
into
the
modern
bourgeois
the
guild
journeyman
and
the
outside
the
guilds
developed
into
the
proletarian
and
although
upon
the
whole
the
bourgeoisie
in
their
struggle
with
the
nobility
could
claim
to
represent
at
the
same
time
the
interests
of
the
different
of
that
period
yet
in
every
great
bourgeois
movement
there
were
independent
outbursts
of
that
class
which
was
the
forerunner
more
or
less
developed
of
the
modern
proletariat
for
example
at
the
time
of
the
german
reformation
and
the
peasants
war
the
anabaptists
and
thomas
münzer
in
the
great
english
revolution
the
levellers
in
the
great
french
revolution
baboeuf
there
were
theoretical
enunciations
corresponding
with
these
revolutionary
uprisings
of
a
class
not
yet
developed
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
utopian
pictures
of
ideal
social
conditions
in
the
eighteenth
actual
communistic
theories
morelly
and
mably
the
demand
for
equality
was
no
longer
limited
to
political
rights
it
was
extended
also
to
the
social
conditions
of
individuals
it
was
not
simply
class
privileges
that
were
to
be
abolished
but
class
distinctions
themselves
a
communism
ascetic
denouncing
all
the
pleasures
of
life
spartan
was
the
first
form
of
the
new
teaching
then
came
the
three
great
utopians
saint
simon
to
whom
the
movement
side
by
side
with
the
proletarian
still
had
a
certain
significance
fourier
and
owen
who
in
the
country
where
capitalist
production
was
most
developed
and
under
the
influence
of
the
antagonisms
begotten
of
this
worked
out
his
proposals
for
the
removal
of
class
distinction
systematically
and
in
direct
relation
to
french
materialism
one
thing
is
common
to
all
three
not
one
of
them
appears
as
a
representative
of
the
interests
of
that
proletariat
which
historical
development
had
in
the
meantime
produced
like
the
french
philosophers
they
do
not
claim
to
emancipate
a
particular
class
to
begin
with
but
all
humanity
at
once
like
them
they
wish
to
bring
in
the
kingdom
of
reason
and
eternal
justice
but
this
kingdom
as
they
see
it
is
as
far
as
heaven
from
earth
from
that
of
the
french
philosophers
for
to
our
three
social
reformers
the
bourgeois
world
based
upon
the
principles
of
these
philosophers
is
quite
as
irrational
and
unjust
and
therefore
finds
its
way
in
the
quite
as
readily
as
feudalism
and
all
the
earlier
stages
of
society
if
pure
reason
and
justice
have
not
hitherto
ruled
the
world
this
has
been
the
case
only
because
men
have
not
rightly
understood
them
what
was
wanted
was
the
individual
man
of
genius
who
has
now
arisen
and
who
understands
the
truth
that
he
has
now
arisen
that
the
truth
has
now
been
clearly
understood
is
not
an
inevitable
event
following
of
necessity
in
the
chain
of
historical
development
but
a
mere
happy
accident
he
might
just
as
well
have
been
born
years
earlier
and
might
then
have
spared
humanity
years
of
error
strife
and
suffering
we
saw
how
the
french
philosophers
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
forerunners
of
the
revolution
appealed
to
reason
as
the
sole
judge
of
all
that
is
a
rational
government
rational
society
were
to
be
founded
everything
that
ran
counter
to
eternal
reason
was
to
be
remorselessly
done
away
with
we
saw
also
that
this
eternal
reason
was
in
reality
nothing
but
the
idealized
understanding
of
the
eighteenth
century
citizen
just
then
evolving
into
the
bourgeois
the
french
revolution
had
realized
this
rational
society
and
government
but
the
new
order
of
things
rational
enough
as
compared
with
earlier
conditions
turned
out
to
be
by
no
means
absolutely
rational
the
state
based
upon
reason
completely
collapsed
rousseau
contrat
social
had
found
its
realization
in
the
reign
of
terror
from
which
the
bourgeoisie
who
had
lost
confidence
in
their
own
political
capacity
had
taken
refuge
first
in
the
corruption
of
the
directorate
and
finally
under
the
wing
of
the
napoleonic
despotism
the
promised
eternal
peace
was
turned
into
an
endless
war
of
conquest
the
society
based
upon
reason
had
fared
no
better
the
antagonism
between
rich
and
poor
instead
of
dissolving
into
general
prosperity
had
become
intensified
by
the
removal
of
the
guild
and
other
privileges
which
had
to
some
extent
bridged
it
over
and
by
the
removal
of
the
charitable
institutions
of
the
church
the
freedom
of
property
from
feudal
fetters
now
veritably
accomplished
turned
out
to
be
for
the
small
capitalists
and
small
proprietors
the
freedom
to
sell
their
small
property
crushed
under
the
overmastering
competition
of
the
large
capitalists
and
landlords
to
these
great
lords
and
thus
as
far
as
the
small
capitalists
and
peasant
proprietors
were
concerned
became
freedom
property
the
development
of
industry
upon
a
capitalistic
basis
made
poverty
and
misery
of
the
working
masses
conditions
of
existence
of
society
cash
payment
became
more
and
more
in
carlyle
phrase
the
sole
nexus
between
man
and
man
the
number
of
crimes
increased
from
year
to
year
formerly
the
feudal
vices
had
openly
stalked
about
in
broad
daylight
though
not
eradicated
they
were
now
at
any
rate
thrust
into
the
background
in
their
stead
the
bourgeois
vices
hitherto
practiced
in
secret
began
to
blossom
all
the
more
luxuriantly
trade
became
to
a
greater
and
greater
extent
cheating
the
fraternity
of
the
revolutionary
motto
was
realized
in
the
chicanery

rivalries
of
the
battle
of
competition
oppression
by
force
was
replaced
by
corruption
the
sword
as
the
first
social
lever
by
gold
the
right
of
the
first
night
was
transferred
from
the
feudal
lords
to
the
bourgeois
manufacturers
prostitution
increased
to
an
extent
never
heard
of
marriage
itself
remained
as
before
the
legally
recognized
form
the
official
cloak
of
prostitution
and
moreover
was
supplemented
by
rich

of

in
a
word
compared
with
the
splendid
promises
of
the
philosophers
the
social
and
political
institutions
born
of
the
triumph
of
reason
were
bitterly
disappointing
caricatures
all
that
was
wanting
was
the
men
to
formulate
this
disappointment
and
they
came
with
the
turn
of
the
century
in
saint
simon
geneva
letters
appeared
in

fourier
first

although
the
groundwork
of
his
theory
dated
from
on
january
robert
owen
undertook
the
direction
of
new
lanark
at
this
time
however
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
and
with
it
the
antagonism
between
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
proletariat
was
still
very
incompletely
developed
modern
industry
which
had
just
arisen
in
england
was
still
unknown
in
france
but
modern
industry
develops
on
the
one
hand
the
conflicts
which
make
absolutely
necessary
a
revolution
in
the
mode
of
production
and
the
doing
away
with
its
capitalistic
character
conflicts
not
only
between
the
classes
begotten
of
it
but
also
between
the
very
productive
forces
and
the
forms
of
exchange
created
by
it
and
on
the
other
hand
it
develops
in
these
very
gigantic
productive
forces
the
means
of
ending
these
conflicts
if
therefore
about
the
year
the
conflicts
arising
from
the
new
social
order
were
only
just
beginning
to
take
shape
this
holds
still
more
fully
as
to
the
means
of
ending
them
the
masses
of
paris
during
the
reign
of
terror
were
able
for
a
moment
to
gain
the
mastery
and
thus
to
lead
the
bourgeois
revolution
to
victory
in
spite
of
the
bourgeoisie
themselves
but
in
doing
so
they
only
proved
how
impossible
it
was
for
their
domination
to
last
under
the
conditions
then
obtaining
the
proletariat
which
then
for
the
first
time
evolved
itself
from
these
masses
as
the
nucleus
of
a
new
class
as
yet
quite
incapable
of
independent
political
action
appeared
as
an
oppressed
suffering
order
to
whom
in
its
incapacity
to
help
itself
help
could
at
best
be
brought
in
from
without
or
down
from
above
this
historical
situation
also
dominated
the
founders
of
socialism
to
the
crude
conditions
of
capitalistic
production
and
the
crude
class
conditions
corresponded
crude
theories
the
solution
of
the
social
problems
which
as
yet
lay
hidden
in
undeveloped
economic
conditions
the
utopians
attempted
to
evolve
out
of
the
human
brain
society
presented
nothing
but
wrongs
to
remove
these
was
the
task
of
reason
it
was
necessary
then
to
discover
a
new
and
more
perfect
system
of
social
order
and
to
impose
this
upon
society
from
without
by
propaganda
and
wherever
it
was
possible
by
the
example
of
model
experiments
these
new
social
systems
were
foredoomed
as
utopian
the
more
completely
they
were
worked
out
in
detail
the
more
they
could
not
avoid
drifting
off
into
pure
phantasies
these
facts
once
established
we
need
not
dwell
a
moment
longer
upon
this
side
of
the
question
now
wholly
belonging
to
the
past
we
can
leave
it
to
the
literary
small
fry
to
solemnly
quibble
over
these
phantasies
which
only
make
us
smile
and
to
crow
over
the
superiority
of
their
own
bald
reasoning
as
compared
with
such
insanity
for
ourselves
we
delight
in
the
stupendously
grand
thoughts
and
germs
of
thought
that
everywhere
break
out
through
their
phantastic
covering
and
to
which
these
philistines
are
blind
saint
simon
was
a
son
of
the
great
french
revolution
at
the
outbreak
of
which
he
was
not
yet
thirty
the
revolution
was
the
victory
of
the
third
estate
of
the
great
masses
of
the
nation
in
production
and
in
trade
over
the
privileged
classes
the
nobles
and
the
priests
but
the
victory
of
the
third
estate
soon
revealed
itself
as
exclusively
the
victory
of
a
small
part
of
this
estate
as
the
conquest
of
political
power
by
the
socially
privileged
section
of
it
the
propertied
bourgeoisie
and
the
bourgeoisie
had
certainly
developed
rapidly
during
the
revolution
partly
by
speculation
in
the
lands
of
the
nobility
and
of
the
church
confiscated
and
afterwards
put
up
for
sale
and
partly
by
frauds
upon
the
nation
by
means
of
army
contracts
it
was
the
domination
of
these
swindlers
that
under
the
directorate
brought
france
to
the
verge
of
ruin
and
thus
gave
napoleon
the
pretext
for
his
hence
to
saint
simon
the
antagonism
between
the
third
estate
and
the
privileged
classes
took
the
form
of
an
antagonism
between
workers
and
idlers
the
idlers
were
not
merely
the
old
privileged
classes
but
also
all
who
without
taking
any
part
in
production
or
distribution
lived
on
their
incomes
and
the
workers
were
not
only
the
but
also
the
manufacturers
the
merchants
the
bankers
that
the
idlers
had
lost
the
capacity
for
intellectual
leadership
and
political
supremacy
had
been
proved
and
was
by
the
revolution
finally
settled
that
the
classes
had
not
this
capacity
seemed
to
saint
simon
proved
by
the
experiences
of
the
reign
of
terror
then
who
was
to
lead
and
command
according
to
saint
simon
science
and
industry
both
united
by
a
new
religious
bond
destined
to
restore
that
unity
of
religious
ideas
which
had
been
lost
since
the
time
of
the
reformation
a
necessarily
mystic
and
rigidly
hierarchic
new
christianity
but
science
that
was
the
scholars
and
industry
that
was
in
the
first
place
the
working
bourgeois
manufacturers
merchants
bankers
these
bourgeoisie
were
certainly
intended
by
saint
simon
to
transform
themselves
into
a
kind
of
public
officials
of
social
trustees
but
they
were
still
to
hold
of
the
workers
a
commanding
and
economically
privileged
position
the
bankers
especially
were
to
be
called
upon
to
direct
the
whole
of
social
production
by
the
regulation
of
credit
this
conception
was
in
exact
keeping
with
a
time
in
which
modern
industry
in
france
and
with
it
the
chasm
between
bourgeoisie
and
proletariat
was
only
just
coming
into
existence
but
what
saint
simon
especially
lays
stress
upon
is
this
what
interests
him
first
and
above
all
other
things
is
the
lot
of
the
class
that
is
the
most
numerous
and
the
most
poor
classe
la
plus
nombreuse
et
la
plus
already
in
his
geneva
letters
saint
simon
lays
down
the
proposition
that
all
men
ought
to
work
in
the
same
work
he
recognizes
also
that
the
reign
of
terror
was
the
reign
of
the
masses
see
says
he
to
them
what
happened
in
france
at
the
time
when
your
comrades
held
sway
there
they
brought
about
a
famine
but
to
recognize
the
french
revolution
as
a
class
war
and
not
simply
one
between
nobility
and
bourgeoisie
but
between
nobility
bourgeoisie
and
the
was
in
the
year
a
most
pregnant
discovery
in
he
declares
that
politics
is
the
science
of
production
and
foretells
the
complete
absorption
of
politics
by
economics
the
knowledge
that
economic
conditions
are
the
basis
of
political
institutions
appears
here
only
in
embryo
yet
what
is
here
already
very
plainly
expressed
is
the
idea
of
the
future
conversion
of
political
rule
over
men
into
an
administration
of
things
and
a
direction
of
processes
of
production
that
is
to
say
the
abolition
of
the
state
about
which
recently
there
has
been
so
much
noise
saint
simon
shows
the
same
superiority
over
his
contemporaries
when
in
immediately
after
the
entry
of
the
allies
into
paris
and
again
in
during
the
hundred
days
war
he
proclaims
the
alliance
of
france
with
england
and
then
of
both
these
countries
with
germany
as
the
only
guarantee
for
the
prosperous
development
and
peace
of
europe
to
preach
to
the
french
in
an
alliance
with
the
victors
of
waterloo
required
as
much
courage
as
historical
foresight
if
in
saint
simon
we
find
a
comprehensive
breadth
of
view
by
virtue
of
which
almost
all
the
ideas
of
later
socialists
that
are
not
strictly
economic
are
found
in
him
in
embryo
we
find
in
fourier
a
criticism
of
the
existing
conditions
of
society
genuinely
french
and
witty
but
not
upon
that
account
any
the
less
thorough
fourier
takes
the
bourgeoisie
their
inspired
prophets
before
the
revolution
and
their
interested
eulogists
after
it
at
their
own
word
he
lays
bare
remorsely
the
material
and
moral
misery
of
the
bourgeois
world
he
confronts
it
with
the
earlier
philosophers
dazzling
promises
of
a
society
in
which
reason
alone
should
reign
of
a
civilization
in
which
happiness
should
be
universal
of
an
illimitable
human
perfectibility
and
with
the
phraseology
of
the
bourgeois
ideologists
of
his
time
he
points
out
how
everywhere
the
most
pitiful
reality
corresponds
with
the
most
phrases
and
he
overwhelms
this
hopeless
fiasco
of
phrases
with
his
mordant
sarcasm
fourier
is
not
only
a
critic
his
imperturbably
serene
nature
makes
him
a
satirist
and
assuredly
one
of
the
greatest
satirists
of
all
time
he
depicts
with
equal
power
and
charm
the
swindling
speculations
that
blossomed
out
upon
the
downfall
of
the
revolution
and
the
shopkeeping
spirit
prevalent
in
and
characteristic
of
french
commerce
at
that
time
still
more
masterly
is
his
criticism
of
the
bourgeois
form
of
the
relations
between
the
sexes
and
the
position
of
woman
in
bourgeois
society
he
was
the
first
to
declare
that
in
any
given
society
the
degree
of
woman
emancipation
is
the
natural
measure
of
the
general
emancipation
but
fourier
is
at
his
greatest
in
his
conception
of
the
history
of
society
he
divides
its
whole
course
thus
far
into
four
stages
of
evolution
savagery
barbarism
the
patriarchate
civilization
this
last
is
identical
with
the
civil
or
bourgeois
society
of
with
the
social
order
that
came
in
with
the
sixteenth
century
he
proves
that
the
civilized
stage
raises
every
vice
practiced
by
barbarism
in
a
simple
fashion
into
a
form
of
existence
complex
ambiguous
equivocal
hypocritical
that
civilization
moves
in
a
vicious
circle
in
contradictions
which
it
constantly
reproduces
without
being
able
to
solve
them
hence
it
constantly
arrives
at
the
very
opposite
to
that
which
it
wants
to
attain
or
pretends
to
want
to
attain
so
that
under
civilization
poverty
is
born
of
superabundance
itself
fourier
as
we
see
uses
the
dialectic
method
in
the
same
masterly
way
as
his
contemporary
hegel
using
these
same
dialectics
he
argues
against
the
talk
about
illimitable
human
perfectibility
that
every
historical
phase
has
its
period
of
ascent
and
also
its
period
of
descent
and
he
applies
this
observation
to
the
future
of
the
whole
human
race
as
kant
introduced
into
natural
science
the
idea
of
the
ultimate
destruction
of
the
earth
fourier
introduced
into
historical
science
that
of
the
ultimate
destruction
of
the
human
race
whilst
in
france
the
hurricane
of
the
revolution
swept
over
the
land
in
england
a
quieter
but
not
on
that
account
less
tremendous
revolution
was
going
on
steam
and
the
new
machinery
were
transforming
manufacture
into
modern
industry
and
thus
revolutionizing
the
whole
foundation
of
bourgeois
society
the
sluggish
march
of
development
of
the
manufacturing
period
changed
into
a
veritable
storm
and
stress
period
of
production
with
constantly
increasing
swiftness
the
of
society
into
large
capitalists
and
proletarians
went
on
between
these
instead
of
the
former
stable
an
unstable
mass
of
artisans
and
small
shopkeepers
the
most
fluctuating
portion
of
the
population
now
led
a
precarious
existence
the
new
mode
of
production
was
as
yet
only
at
the
beginning
of
its
period
of
ascent
as
yet
it
was
the
normal
regular
method
of
production
the
only
one
possible
under
existing
conditions
nevertheless
even
then
it
was
producing
crying
social
abuses
the
herding
together
of
a
homeless
population
in
the
worst
quarters
of
the
large
towns
the
loosening
of
all
traditional
moral
bonds
of
patriarchal
subordination
of
family
relations
overwork
especially
of
women
and
children
to
a
frightful
extent
complete
demoralization
of
the
suddenly
flung
into
altogether
new
conditions
from
the
country
into
the
town
from
agriculture
into
modern
industry
from
stable
conditions
of
existence
into
insecure
ones
that
changed
from
day
to
day
at
this
juncture
there
came
forward
as
a
reformer
a
manufacturer
years
old
a
man
of
almost
sublime
childlike
simplicity
of
character
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
few
born
leaders
of
men
robert
owen
had
adopted
the
teaching
of
the
materialistic
philosophers
that
man
character
is
the
product
on
the
one
hand
of
heredity
on
the
other
of
the
environment
of
the
individual
during
his
lifetime
and
especially
during
his
period
of
development
in
the
industrial
revolution
most
of
his
class
saw
only
chaos
and
confusion
and
the
opportunity
of
fishing
in
these
troubled
waters
and
making
large
fortunes
quickly
he
saw
in
it
the
opportunity
of
putting
into
practice
his
favorite
theory
and
so
of
bringing
order
out
of
chaos
he
had
already
tried
it
with
success
as
superintendent
of
more
than
five
hundred
men
in
a
manchester
factory
from
to
he
directed
the
great
cotton
mill
at
new
lanark
in
scotland
as
managing
partner
along
the
same
lines
but
with
greater
freedom
of
action
and
with
a
success
that
made
him
a
european
reputation
a
population
originally
consisting
of
the
most
diverse
and
for
the
most
part
very
demoralized
elements
a
population
that
gradually
grew
to
he
turned
into
a
model
colony
in
which
drunkenness
police
magistrates
lawsuits
poor
laws
charity
were
unknown
and
all
this
simply
by
placing
the
people
in
conditions
worthy
of
human
beings
and
especially
by
carefully
bringing
up
the
rising
generation
he
was
the
founder
of
infant
schools
and
introduced
them
first
at
new
lanark
at
the
age
of
two
the
children
came
to
school
where
they
enjoyed
themselves
so
much
that
they
could
scarcely
be
got
home
again
whilst
his
competitors
worked
their
people
thirteen
or
fourteen
hours
a
day
in
new
lanark
the
was
only
ten
and
a
half
hours
when
a
crisis
in
cotton
stopped
work
for
four
months
his
workers
received
their
full
wages
all
the
time
and
with
all
this
the
business
more
than
doubled
in
value
and
to
the
last
yielded
large
profits
to
its
proprietors
in
spite
of
all
this
owen
was
not
content
the
existence
which
he
secured
for
his
workers
was
in
his
eyes
still
far
from
being
worthy
of
human
beings
the
people
were
slaves
at
my
mercy
the
relatively
favorable
conditions
in
which
he
had
placed
them
were
still
far
from
allowing
a
rational
development
of
the
character
and
of
the
intellect
in
all
directions
much
less
of
the
free
exercise
of
all
their
faculties
and
yet
the
working
part
of
this
population
of
persons
was
daily
producing
as
much
real
wealth
for
society
as
less
than
half
a
century
before
it
would
have
required
the
working
part
of
a
population
of
to
create
i
asked
myself
what
became
of
the
difference
between
the
wealth
consumed
by
persons
and
that
which
would
have
been
consumed
by
the
answer
was
clear
it
had
been
used
to
pay
the
proprietors
of
the
establishment
per
cent
on
the
capital
they
had
laid
out
in
addition
to
over
clear
profit
and
that
which
held
for
new
lanark
held
to
a
still
greater
extent
for
all
the
factories
in
england
if
this
new
wealth
had
not
been
created
by
machinery
imperfectly
as
it
has
been
applied
the
wars
of
europe
in
opposition
to
napoleon
and
to
support
the
aristocratic
principles
of
society
could
not
have
been
maintained
and
yet
this
new
power
was
the
creation
of
the
to
them
therefore
the
fruits
of
this
new
power
belonged
the
gigantic
productive
forces
hitherto
used
only
to
enrich
individuals
and
to
enslave
the
masses
offered
to
owen
the
foundations
for
a
reconstruction
of
society
they
were
destined
as
the
common
property
of
all
to
be
worked
for
the
common
good
of
all
owen
communism
was
based
upon
this
purely
business
foundation
the
outcome
so
to
say
of
commercial
calculation
throughout
it
maintained
this
practical
character
thus
in
owen
proposed
the
relief
of
the
distress
in
ireland
by
communist
colonies
and
drew
up
complete
estimates
of
costs
of
founding
them
yearly
expenditure
and
probable
revenue
and
in
his
definite
plan
for
the
future
the
technical
working
out
of
details
is
managed
with
such
practical
knowledge
ground
plan
front
and
side
and
views
all
included
that
the
owen
method
of
social
reform
once
accepted
there
is
from
the
practical
point
of
view
little
to
be
said
against
the
actual
arrangement
of
details
his
advance
in
the
direction
of
communism
was
the
in
owen
life
as
long
as
he
was
simply
a
philanthropist
he
was
rewarded
with
nothing
but
wealth
applause
honor
and
glory
he
was
the
most
popular
man
in
europe
not
only
men
of
his
own
class
but
statesmen
and
princes
listened
to
him
approvingly
but
when
he
came
out
with
his
communist
theories
that
was
quite
another
thing
three
great
obstacles
seemed
to
him
especially
to
block
the
path
to
social
reform
private
property
religion
the
present
form
of
marriage
he
knew
what
confronted
him
if
he
attacked
these
outlawry
excommunication
from
official
society
the
loss
of
his
whole
social
position
but
nothing
of
this
prevented
him
from
attacking
them
without
fear
of
consequences
and
what
he
had
foreseen
happened
banished
from
official
society
with
a
conspiracy
of
silence
against
him
in
the
press
ruined
by
his
unsuccessful
communist
experiments
in
america
in
which
he
sacrificed
all
his
fortune
he
turned
directly
to
the
and
continued
working
in
their
midst
for
thirty
years
every
social
movement
every
real
advance
in
england
on
behalf
of
the
workers
links
itself
on
to
the
name
of
robert
owen
he
forced
through
in
after
five
years
fighting
the
first
law
limiting
the
hours
of
labor
of
women
and
children
in
factories
he
was
president
of
the
first
congress
at
which
all
the
trade
unions
of
england
united
in
a
single
great
trade
association
he
introduced
as
transition
measures
to
the
complete
communistic
organization
of
society
on
the
one
hand
cooperative
societies
for
retail
trade
and
production
these
have
since
that
time
at
least
given
practical
proof
that
the
merchant
and
the
manufacturer
are
socially
quite
unnecessary
on
the
other
hand
he
introduced
labor
bazaars
for
the
exchange
of
the
products
of
labor
through
the
medium
of
whose
unit
was
a
single
hour
of
work
institutions
necessarily
doomed
to
failure
but
completely
anticipating
proudhon
bank
of
exchange
of
a
much
later
period
and
differing
entirely
from
this
in
that
it
did
not
claim
to
be
the
panacea
for
all
social
ills
but
only
a
first
step
towards
a
much
more
radical
revolution
of
society
the
utopians
mode
of
thought
has
for
a
long
time
governed
the
socialist
ideas
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
still
governs
some
of
them
until
very
recently
all
french
and
english
socialists
did
homage
to
it
the
earlier
german
communism
including
that
of
weitling
was
of
the
same
school
to
all
these
socialism
is
the
expression
of
absolute
truth
reason
and
justice
and
has
only
to
be
discovered
to
conquer
all
the
world
by
virtue
of
its
own
power
and
as
absolute
truth
is
independent
of
time
space
and
of
the
historical
development
of
man
it
is
a
mere
accident
when
and
where
it
is
discovered
with
all
this
absolute
truth
reason
and
justice
are
different
with
the
founder
of
each
different
school
and
as
each
one
special
kind
of
absolute
truth
reason
and
justice
is
again
conditioned
by
his
subjective
understanding
his
conditions
of
existence
the
measure
of
his
knowledge
and
his
intellectual
training
there
is
no
other
ending
possible
in
this
conflict
of
absolute
truths
than
that
they
shall
be
mutually
exclusive
one
of
the
other
hence
from
this
nothing
could
come
but
a
kind
of
eclectic
average
socialism
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
has
up
to
the
present
time
dominated
the
minds
of
most
of
the
socialist
workers
in
france
and
england
hence
a
allowing
of
the
most
manifold
shades
of
opinion
a
of
such
critical
statements
economic
theories
pictures
of
future
society
by
the
founders
of
different
sects
as
excite
a
minimum
of
opposition
a
which
is
the
more
easily
brewed
the
more
the
definite
sharp
edges
of
the
individual
constituents
are
rubbed
down
in
the
stream
of
debate
like
rounded
pebbles
in
a
brook
to
make
a
science
of
socialism
it
had
first
to
be
placed
upon
a
real
basis
footnotes
this
is
the
passage
on
the
french
revolution
thought
the
concept
of
law
all
at
once
made
itself
felt
and
against
this
the
old
scaffolding
of
wrong
could
make
no
stand
in
this
conception
of
law
therefore
a
constitution
has
now
been
established
and
henceforth
everything
must
be
based
upon
this
since
the
sun
had
been
in
the
firmament
and
the
planets
circled
round
him
the
sight
had
never
been
seen
of
man
standing
upon
his
head
on
the
idea
and
building
reality
after
this
image
anaxagoras
first
said
that
the
nous
reason
rules
the
world
but
now
for
the
first
time
had
man
come
to
recognize
that
the
idea
must
rule
the
mental
reality
and
this
was
a
magnificent
sunrise
all
thinking
beings
have
participated
in
celebrating
this
holy
day
a
sublime
emotion
swayed
men
at
that
time
an
enthusiasm
of
reason
pervaded
the
world
as
if
now
had
come
the
reconciliation
of
the
divine
principle
with
the
world
hegel
philosophy
of
history
p
is
it
not
high
time
to
set
the
law
in
action
against
such
teachings
subversive
and
to
the
common
danger
by
the
late
professor
hegel
from
the
revolution
in
mind
and
practice
a
memorial
addressed
to
all
the
red
republicans
communists
and
socialists
of
europe
and
sent
to
the
provisional
government
of
france
and
also
to
queen

and
her
responsible

note
ii
in
the
meantime
along
with
and
after
the
french
philosophy
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
arisen
the
new
german
philosophy
culminating
in
hegel
its
greatest
merit
was
the
taking
up
again
of
dialectics
as
the
highest
form
of
reasoning
the
old
greek
philosophers
were
all
born
natural
dialecticians
and
aristotle
the
most
encyclopædic
intellect
of
them
had
already
analyzed
the
most
essential
forms
of
dialectic
thought
the
newer
philosophy
on
the
other
hand
although
in
it
also
dialectics
had
brilliant
exponents
descartes
and
spinoza
had
especially
through
english
influence
become
more
and
more
rigidly
fixed
in
the
metaphysical
mode
of
reasoning
by
which
also
the
french
of
the
eighteenth
century
were
almost
wholly
dominated
at
all
events
in
their
special
philosophical
work
outside
philosophy
in
the
restricted
sense
the
french
nevertheless
produced
masterpieces
of
dialectic
we
need
only
call
to
mind
diderot
le
neveu
de
rameau
and
rousseau
discours
sur
et
les
fondements
de
parmi
les
hommes
we
give
here
in
brief
the
essential
character
of
these
two
modes
of
thought
when
we
consider
and
reflect
upon
nature
at
large
or
the
history
of
mankind
or
our
own
intellectual
activity
at
first
we
see
the
picture
of
an
endless
entanglement
of
relations
and
reactions
permutations
and
combinations
in
which
nothing
remains
what
where
and
as
it
was
but
everything
moves
changes
comes
into
being
and
passes
away
we
see
therefore
at
first
the
picture
as
a
whole
with
its
individual
parts
still
more
or
less
kept
in
the
background
we
observe
the
movements
transitions
connections
rather
than
the
things
that
move
combine
and
are
connected
this
primitive
naïve
but
intrinsically
correct
conception
of
the
world
is
that
of
ancient
greek
philosophy
and
was
first
clearly
formulated
by
heraclitus
everything
is
and
is
not
for
everything
is
fluid
is
constantly
changing
constantly
coming
into
being
and
passing
away
but
this
conception
correctly
as
it
expresses
the
general
character
of
the
picture
of
appearances
as
a
whole
does
not
suffice
to
explain
the
details
of
which
this
picture
is
made
up
and
so
long
as
we
do
not
understand
these
we
have
not
a
clear
idea
of
the
whole
picture
in
order
to
understand
these
details
we
must
detach
them
from
their
natural
or
historical
connection
and
examine
each
one
separately
its
nature
special
causes
effects
etc
this
is
primarily
the
task
of
natural
science
and
historical
research
branches
of
science
which
the
greeks
of
classical
times
on
very
good
grounds
relegated
to
a
subordinate
position
because
they
had
first
of
all
to
collect
materials
for
these
sciences
to
work
upon
a
certain
amount
of
natural
and
historical
material
must
be
collected
before
there
can
be
any
critical
analysis
comparison
and
arrangement
in
classes
orders
and
species
the
foundations
of
the
exact
natural
sciences
were
therefore
first
worked
out
by
the
greeks
of
the
alexandrian
period
and
later
on
in
the
middle
ages
by
the
arabs
real
natural
science
dates
from
the
second
half
of
the
fifteenth
century
and
thence
onward
it
has
advanced
with
constantly
increasing
rapidity
the
analysis
of
nature
into
its
individual
parts
the
grouping
of
the
different
natural
processes
and
objects
in
definite
classes
the
study
of
the
internal
anatomy
of
organized
bodies
in
their
manifold
forms
these
were
the
fundamental
conditions
of
the
gigantic
strides
in
our
knowledge
of
nature
that
have
been
made
during
the
last
four
hundred
years
but
this
method
of
work
has
also
left
us
as
legacy
the
habit
of
observing
natural
objects
and
processes
in
isolation
apart
from
their
connection
with
the
vast
whole
of
observing
them
in
repose
not
in
motion
as
constants
not
as
essentially
variables
in
their
death
not
in
their
life
and
when
this
way
of
looking
at
things
was
transferred
by
bacon
and
locke
from
natural
science
to
philosophy
it
begot
the
narrow
metaphysical
mode
of
thought
peculiar
to
the
last
century
to
the
metaphysician
things
and
their
mental
reflexes
ideas
are
isolated
are
to
be
considered
one
after
the
other
and
apart
from
each
other
are
objects
of
investigation
fixed
rigid
given
once
for
all
he
thinks
in
absolutely
irreconcilable
antitheses
his
communication
is
yea
nay
nay
for
whatsoever
is
more
than
these
cometh
of
evil
for
him
a
thing
either
exists
or
does
not
exist
a
thing
can
not
at
the
same
time
be
itself
and
something
else
positive
and
negative
absolutely
exclude
one
another
cause
and
effect
stand
in
a
rigid
antithesis
one
to
the
other
at
first
sight
this
mode
of
thinking
seems
to
us
very
luminous
because
it
is
that
of
sound
commonsense
only
sound
commonsense
respectable
fellow
that
he
is
in
the
homely
realm
of
his
own
four
walls
has
very
wonderful
adventures
directly
he
ventures
out
into
the
wide
world
of
research
and
the
metaphysical
mode
of
thought
justifiable
and
necessary
as
it
is
in
a
number
of
domains
whose
extent
varies
according
to
the
nature
of
the
particular
object
of
investigation
sooner
or
later
reaches
a
limit
beyond
which
it
becomes
restricted
abstract
lost
in
insoluble
contradictions
in
the
contemplation
of
individual
things
it
forgets
the
connection
between
them
in
the
contemplation
of
their
existence
it
forgets
the
beginning
and
end
of
that
existence
of
their
repose
it
forgets
their
motion
it
can
not
see
the
wood
for
the
trees
for
everyday
purposes
we
know
and
can
say
whether
an
animal
is
alive
or
not
but
upon
closer
inquiry
we
find
that
this
is
in
many
cases
a
very
complex
question
as
the
jurists
know
very
well
they
have
cudgelled
their
brains
in
vain
to
discover
a
rational
limit
beyond
which
the
killing
of
the
child
in
its
mother
womb
is
murder
it
is
just
as
impossible
to
determine
absolutely
the
moment
of
death
for
physiology
proves
that
death
is
not
an
instantaneous
momentary
phenomenon
but
a
very
protracted
process
in
like
manner
every
organized
being
is
every
moment
the
same
and
not
the
same
every
moment
it
assimilates
matter
supplied
from
without
and
gets
rid
of
other
matter
every
moment
some
cells
of
its
body
die
and
others
build
themselves
anew
in
a
longer
or
shorter
time
the
matter
of
its
body
is
completely
renewed
and
is
replaced
by
other
molecules
of
matter
so
that
every
organized
being
is
always
itself
and
yet
something
other
than
itself
further
we
find
upon
closer
investigation
that
the
two
poles
of
an
antithesis
positive
and
negative
are
as
inseparable
as
they
are
opposed
and
that
despite
all
their
opposition
they
mutually
interpenetrate
and
we
find
in
like
manner
that
cause
and
effect
are
conceptions
which
only
hold
good
in
their
application
to
individual
cases
but
as
soon
as
we
consider
the
individual
cases
in
their
general
connection
with
the
universe
as
a
whole
they
run
into
each
other
and
they
become
confounded
when
we
contemplate
that
universal
action
and
reaction
in
which
causes
and
effects
are
eternally
changing
places
so
that
what
is
effect
here
and
now
will
be
cause
there
and
then
and
none
of
these
processes
and
modes
of
thought
enters
into
the
framework
of
metaphysical
reasoning
dialectics
on
the
other
hand
comprehends
things
and
their
representations
ideas
in
their
essential
connection
concatenation
motion
origin
and
ending
such
processes
as
those
mentioned
above
are
therefore
so
many
corroborations
of
its
own
method
of
procedure
nature
is
the
proof
of
dialectics
and
it
must
be
said
for
modern
science
that
it
has
furnished
this
proof
with
very
rich
materials
increasing
daily
and
thus
has
shown
that
in
the
last
resort
nature
works
dialectically
and
not
metaphysically
that
she
does
not
move
in
the
eternal
oneness
of
a
perpetually
recurring
circle
but
goes
through
a
real
historical
evolution
in
this
connection
darwin
must
be
named
before
all
others
he
dealt
the
metaphysical
conception
of
nature
the
heaviest
blow
by
his
proof
that
all
organic
beings
plants
animals
and
man
himself
are
the
products
of
a
process
of
evolution
going
on
through
millions
of
years
but
the
naturalists
who
have
learned
to
think
dialectically
are
few
and
far
between
and
this
conflict
of
the
results
of
discovery
with
preconceived
modes
of
thinking
explains
the
endless
confusion
now
reigning
in
theoretical
natural
science
the
despair
of
teachers
as
well
as
learners
of
authors
and
readers
alike
an
exact
representation
of
the
universe
of
its
evolution
of
the
development
of
mankind
and
of
the
reflection
of
this
evolution
in
the
minds
of
men
can
therefore
only
be
obtained
by
the
methods
of
dialectics
with
its
constant
regard
to
the
innumerable
actions
and
reactions
of
life
and
death
of
progressive
or
retrogressive
changes
and
in
this
spirit
the
new
german
philosophy
has
worked
kant
began
his
career
by
resolving
the
stable
solar
system
of
newton
and
its
eternal
duration
after
the
famous
initial
impulse
had
once
been
given
into
the
result
of
a
historic
process
the
formation
of
the
sun
and
all
the
planets
out
of
a
rotating
nebulous
mass
from
this
he
at
the
same
time
drew
the
conclusion
that
given
this
origin
of
the
solar
system
its
future
death
followed
of
necessity
his
theory
half
a
century
later
was
established
mathematically
by
laplace
and
half
a
century
after
that
the
spectroscope
proved
the
existence
in
space
of
such
incandescent
masses
of
gas
in
various
stages
of
condensation
this
new
german
philosophy
culminated
in
the
hegelian
system
in
this
system
and
herein
is
its
great
merit
for
the
first
time
the
whole
world
natural
historical
intellectual
is
represented
as
a
process
as
in
constant
motion
change
transformation
development
and
the
attempt
is
made
to
trace
out
the
internal
connection
that
makes
a
continuous
whole
of
all
this
movement
and
development
from
this
point
of
view
the
history
of
mankind
no
longer
appeared
as
a
wild
whirl
of
senseless
deeds
of
violence
all
equally
condemnable
at
the
judgment
seat
of
mature
philosophic
reason
and
which
are
best
forgotten
as
quickly
as
possible
but
as
the
process
of
evolution
of
man
himself
it
was
now
the
task
of
the
intellect
to
follow
the
gradual
march
of
this
process
through
all
its
devious
ways
and
to
trace
out
the
inner
law
running
through
all
its
apparently
accidental
phenomena
that
the
hegelian
system
did
not
solve
the
problem
it
propounded
is
here
immaterial
its
merit
was
that
it
propounded
the
problem
this
problem
is
one
that
no
single
individual
will
ever
be
able
to
solve
although
hegel
was
with
saint
simon
the
most
encyclopædic
mind
of
his
time
yet
he
was
limited
first
by
the
necessarily
limited
extent
of
his
own
knowledge
and
second
by
the
limited
extent
and
depth
of
the
knowledge
and
conceptions
of
his
age
to
these
limits
a
third
must
be
added
hegel
was
an
idealist
to
him
the
thoughts
within
his
brain
were
not
the
more
or
less
abstract
pictures
of
actual
things
and
processes
but
conversely
things
and
their
evolution
were
only
the
realized
pictures
of
the
idea
existing
somewhere
from
eternity
before
the
world
was
this
way
of
thinking
turned
everything
upside
down
and
completely
reversed
the
actual
connection
of
things
in
the
world
correctly
and
ingeniously
as
many
individual
groups
of
facts
were
grasped
by
hegel
yet
for
the
reasons
just
given
there
is
much
that
is
botched
artificial
labored
in
a
word
wrong
in
point
of
detail
the
hegelian
system
in
itself
was
a
colossal
miscarriage
but
it
was
also
the
last
of
its
kind
it
was
suffering
in
fact
from
an
internal
and
incurable
contradiction
upon
the
one
hand
its
essential
proposition
was
the
conception
that
human
history
is
a
process
of
evolution
which
by
its
very
nature
can
not
find
its
intellectual
final
term
in
the
discovery
of
any
absolute
truth
but
on
the
other
hand
it
laid
claim
to
being
the
very
essence
of
this
absolute
truth
a
system
of
natural
and
historical
knowledge
embracing
everything
and
final
for
all
time
is
a
contradiction
to
the
fundamental
law
of
dialectic
reasoning
this
law
indeed
by
no
means
excludes
but
on
the
contrary
includes
the
idea
that
the
systematic
knowledge
of
the
external
universe
can
make
giant
strides
from
age
to
age
the
perception
of
the
fundamental
contradiction
in
german
idealism
led
necessarily
back
to
materialism
but
not
to
the
simply
metaphysical
exclusively
mechanical
materialism
of
the
eighteenth
century
old
materialism
looked
upon
all
previous
history
as
a
crude
heap
of
irrationality
and
violence
modern
materialism
sees
in
it
the
process
of
evolution
of
humanity
and
aims
at
discovering
the
laws
thereof
with
the
french
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
even
with
hegel
the
conception
obtained
of
nature
as
a
whole
moving
in
narrow
circles
and
forever
immutable
with
its
eternal
celestial
bodies
as
newton
and
unalterable
organic
species
as
linnæus
taught
modern
materialism
embraces
the
more
recent
discoveries
of
natural
science
according
to
which
nature
also
has
its
history
in
time
the
celestial
bodies
like
the
organic
species
that
under
favorable
conditions
people
them
being
born
and
perishing
and
even
if
nature
as
a
whole
must
still
be
said
to
move
in
recurrent
cycles
these
cycles
assume
infinitely
larger
dimensions
in
both
aspects
modern
materialism
is
essentially
dialectic
and
no
longer
requires
the
assistance
of
that
sort
of
philosophy
which
pretended
to
rule
the
remaining
mob
of
sciences
as
soon
as
each
special
science
is
bound
to
make
clear
its
position
in
the
great
totality
of
things
and
of
our
knowledge
of
things
a
special
science
dealing
with
this
totality
is
superfluous
or
unnecessary
that
which
still
survives
of
all
earlier
philosophy
is
the
science
of
thought
and
its
laws
formal
logic
and
dialectics
everything
else
is
subsumed
in
the
positive
science
of
nature
and
history
whilst
however
the
revolution
in
the
conception
of
nature
could
only
be
made
in
proportion
to
the
corresponding
positive
materials
furnished
by
research
already
much
earlier
certain
historical
facts
had
occurred
which
led
to
a
decisive
change
in
the
conception
of
history
in
the
first
rising
took
place
in
lyons
between
and
the
first
national
movement
that
of
the
english
chartists
reached
its
height
the
class
struggle
between
proletariat
and
bourgeoisie
came
to
the
front
in
the
history
of
the
most
advanced
countries
in
europe
in
proportion
to
the
development
upon
the
one
hand
of
modern
industry
upon
the
other
of
the
political
supremacy
of
the
bourgeoisie
facts
more
and
more
strenuously
gave
the
lie
to
the
teachings
of
bourgeois
economy
as
to
the
identity
of
the
interests
of
capital
and
labor
as
to
the
universal
harmony
and
universal
prosperity
that
would
be
the
consequence
of
unbridled
competition
all
these
things
could
no
longer
be
ignored
any
more
than
the
french
and
english
socialism
which
was
their
theoretical
though
very
imperfect
expression
but
the
old
idealist
conception
of
history
which
was
not
yet
dislodged
knew
nothing
of
class
struggles
based
upon
economic
interests
knew
nothing
of
economic
interests
production
and
all
economic
relations
appeared
in
it
only
as
incidental
subordinate
elements
in
the
history
of
civilization
the
new
facts
made
imperative
a
new
examination
of
all
past
history
then
it
was
seen
that
past
history
with
the
exception
of
its
primitive
stages
was
the
history
of
class
struggles
that
these
warring
classes
of
society
are
always
the
products
of
the
modes
of
production
and
of
exchange
in
a
word
of
the
conditions
of
their
time
that
the
economic
structure
of
society
always
furnishes
the
real
basis
starting
from
which
we
can
alone
work
out
the
ultimate
explanation
of
the
whole
superstructure
of
juridical
and
political
institutions
as
well
as
of
the
religious
philosophical
and
other
ideas
of
a
given
historical
period
hegel
had
freed
history
from
metaphysics
he
had
made
it
dialectic
but
his
conception
of
history
was
essentially
idealistic
but
now
idealism
was
driven
from
its
last
refuge
the
philosophy
of
history
now
a
materialistic
treatment
of
history
was
propounded
and
a
method
found
of
explaining
knowing
by
his
being
instead
of
as
heretofore
his
being
by
his
knowing
from
that
time
forward
socialism
was
no
longer
an
accidental
discovery
of
this
or
that
ingenious
brain
but
the
necessary
outcome
of
the
struggle
between
two
historically
developed
classes
the
proletariat
and
the
bourgeoisie
its
task
was
no
longer
to
manufacture
a
system
of
society
as
perfect
as
possible
but
to
examine
the
succession
of
events
from
which
these
classes
and
their
antagonism
had
of
necessity
sprung
and
to
discover
in
the
economic
conditions
thus
created
the
means
of
ending
the
conflict
but
the
socialism
of
earlier
days
was
as
incompatible
with
this
materialistic
conception
as
the
conception
of
nature
of
the
french
materialists
was
with
dialectics
and
modern
natural
science
the
socialism
of
earlier
days
certainly
criticised
the
existing
capitalistic
mode
of
production
and
its
consequences
but
it
could
not
explain
them
and
therefore
could
not
get
the
mastery
of
them
it
could
only
simply
reject
them
as
bad
the
more
strongly
this
earlier
socialism
denounced
the
exploitation
of
the
inevitable
under
capitalism
the
less
able
was
it
clearly
to
show
in
what
this
exploitation
consisted
and
how
it
arose
but
for
this
it
was
necessary
to
present
the
capitalistic
method
of
production
in
its
historical
connection
and
its
inevitableness
during
a
particular
historical
period
and
therefore
also
to
present
its
inevitable
downfall
and
to
lay
bare
its
essential
character
which
was
still
a
secret
this
was
done
by
the
discovery
of
it
was
shown
that
the
appropriation
of
unpaid
labor
is
the
basis
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
and
of
the
exploitation
of
the
worker
that
occurs
under
it
that
even
if
the
capitalist
buys
the
of
his
laborer
at
its
full
value
as
a
commodity
on
the
market
he
yet
extracts
more
value
from
it
than
he
paid
for
and
that
in
the
ultimate
analysis
this
forms
those
sums
of
value
from
which
are
heaped
up
the
constantly
increasing
masses
of
capital
in
the
hands
of
the
possessing
classes
the
genesis
of
capitalist
production
and
the
production
of
capital
were
both
explained
these
two
great
discoveries
the
materialistic
conception
of
history
and
the
revelation
of
the
secret
of
capitalistic
production
through
we
owe
to
marx
with
these
discoveries
socialism
became
a
science
the
next
thing
was
to
work
out
all
its
details
and
relations
iii
the
materialist
conception
of
history
starts
from
the
proposition
that
the
production
of
the
means
to
support
human
life
and
next
to
production
the
exchange
of
things
produced
is
the
basis
of
all
social
structure
that
in
every
society
that
has
appeared
in
history
the
manner
in
which
wealth
is
distributed
and
society
divided
into
classes
or
orders
is
dependent
upon
what
is
produced
how
it
is
produced
and
how
the
products
are
exchanged
from
this
point
of
view
the
final
causes
of
all
social
changes
and
political
revolutions
are
to
be
sought
not
in
men
brains
not
in
man
better
insight
into
eternal
truth
and
justice
but
in
changes
in
the
modes
of
production
and
exchange
they
are
to
be
sought
not
in
the
but
in
the
of
each
particular
epoch
the
growing
perception
that
existing
social
institutions
are
unreasonable
and
unjust
that
reason
has
become
unreason
and
right
wrong
is
only
proof
that
in
the
modes
of
production
and
exchange
changes
have
silently
taken
place
with
which
the
social
order
adapted
to
earlier
economic
conditions
is
no
longer
in
keeping
from
this
it
also
follows
that
the
means
of
getting
rid
of
the
incongruities
that
have
been
brought
to
light
must
also
be
present
in
a
more
or
less
developed
condition
within
the
changed
modes
of
production
themselves
these
means
are
not
to
be
invented
by
deduction
from
fundamental
principles
but
are
to
be
discovered
in
the
stubborn
facts
of
the
existing
system
of
production
what
is
then
the
position
of
modern
socialism
in
this
connection
the
present
structure
of
society
this
is
now
pretty
generally
conceded
is
the
creation
of
the
ruling
class
of
of
the
bourgeoisie
the
mode
of
production
peculiar
to
the
bourgeoisie
known
since
marx
as
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
was
incompatible
with
the
feudal
system
with
the
privileges
it
conferred
upon
individuals
entire
social
ranks
and
local
corporations
as
well
as
with
the
hereditary
ties
of
subordination
which
constituted
the
framework
of
its
social
organization
the
bourgeoisie
broke
up
the
feudal
system
and
built
upon
its
ruins
the
capitalist
order
of
society
the
kingdom
of
free
competition
of
personal
liberty
of
the
equality
before
the
law
of
all
commodity
owners
of
all
the
rest
of
the
capitalist
blessings
thenceforward
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
could
develop
in
freedom
since
steam
machinery
and
the
making
of
machines
by
machinery
transformed
the
older
manufacture
into
modern
industry
the
productive
forces
evolved
under
the
guidance
of
the
bourgeoisie
developed
with
a
rapidity
and
in
a
degree
unheard
of
before
but
just
as
the
older
manufacture
in
its
time
and
handicraft
becoming
more
developed
under
its
influence
had
come
into
collision
with
the
feudal
trammels
of
the
guilds
so
now
modern
industry
in
its
more
complete
development
comes
into
collision
with
the
bounds
within
which
the
capitalistic
mode
of
production
holds
it
confined
the
new
productive
forces
have
already
outgrown
the
capitalistic
mode
of
using
them
and
this
conflict
between
productive
forces
and
modes
of
production
is
not
a
conflict
engendered
in
the
mind
of
man
like
that
between
original
sin
and
divine
justice
it
exists
in
fact
objectively
outside
us
independently
of
the
will
and
actions
even
of
the
men
that
have
brought
it
on
modern
socialism
is
nothing
but
the
reflex
in
thought
of
this
conflict
in
fact
its
ideal
reflection
in
the
minds
first
of
the
class
directly
suffering
under
it
the
now
in
what
does
this
conflict
consist
before
capitalistic
production
in
the
middle
ages
the
system
of
petty
industry
obtained
generally
based
upon
the
private
property
of
the
laborers
in
their
means
of
production
in
the
country
the
agriculture
of
the
small
peasant
freeman
or
serf
in
the
towns
the
handicrafts
organized
in
guilds
the
instruments
of
labor
land
agricultural
implements
the
workshop
the
tool
were
the
instruments
of
labor
of
single
individuals
adapted
for
the
use
of
one
worker
and
therefore
of
necessity
small
dwarfish
circumscribed
but
for
this
very
reason
they
belonged
as
a
rule
to
the
producer
himself
to
concentrate
these
scattered
limited
means
of
production
to
enlarge
them
to
turn
them
into
the
powerful
levers
of
production
of
the
present
day
this
was
precisely
the
historic
rôle
of
capitalist
production
and
of
its
upholder
the
bourgeoisie
in
the
fourth
section
of
capital
marx
has
explained
in
detail
how
since
the
fifteenth
century
this
has
been
historically
worked
out
through
the
three
phases
of
simple
manufacture
and
modern
industry
but
the
bourgeoisie
as
is
also
shown
there
could
not
transform
these
puny
means
of
production
into
mighty
productive
forces
without
transforming
them
at
the
same
time
from
means
of
production
of
the
individual
into
means
of
production
only
workable
by
a
collectivity
of
men
the
the
handloom
the
blacksmith
hammer
were
replaced
by
the
the
the
the
individual
workshop
by
the
factory
implying
the
of
hundreds
and
thousands
of
workmen
in
like
manner
production
itself
changed
from
a
series
of
individual
into
a
series
of
social
acts
and
the
products
from
individual
to
social
products
the
yarn
the
cloth
the
metal
articles
that
now
came
out
of
the
factory
were
the
joint
product
of
many
workers
through
whose
hands
they
had
successively
to
pass
before
they
were
ready
no
one
person
could
say
of
them
i
made
that
this
is
product
but
where
in
a
given
society
the
fundamental
form
of
production
is
that
spontaneous
division
of
labor
which
creeps
in
gradually
and
not
upon
any
preconceived
plan
there
the
products
take
on
the
form
of
whose
mutual
exchange
buying
and
selling
enable
the
individual
producers
to
satisfy
their
manifold
wants
and
this
was
the
case
in
the
middle
ages
the
peasant
sold
to
the
artisan
agricultural
products
and
bought
from
him
the
products
of
handicraft
into
this
society
of
individual
producers
of
the
new
mode
of
production
thrust
itself
in
the
midst
of
the
old
division
of
labor
grown
up
spontaneously
and
upon
definite
which
had
governed
the
whole
of
society
now
arose
division
of
labor
upon
definite
as
organized
in
the
factory
side
by
side
with
production
appeared
production
the
products
of
both
were
sold
in
the
same
market
and
therefore
at
prices
at
least
approximately
equal
but
organization
upon
a
definite
plan
was
stronger
than
spontaneous
division
of
labor
the
factories
working
with
the
combined
social
forces
of
a
collectivity
of
individuals
produced
their
commodities
far
more
cheaply
than
the
individual
small
producers
individual
production
succumbed
in
one
department
after
another
socialized
production
revolutionized
all
the
old
methods
of
production
but
its
revolutionary
character
was
at
the
same
time
so
little
recognized
that
it
was
on
the
contrary
introduced
as
a
means
of
increasing
and
developing
the
production
of
commodities
when
it
arose
it
found
and
made
liberal
use
of
certain
machinery
for
the
production
and
exchange
of
commodities
merchants
capital
handicraft
socialized
production
thus
introducing
itself
as
a
new
form
of
the
production
of
commodities
it
was
a
matter
of
course
that
under
it
the
old
forms
of
appropriation
remained
in
full
swing
and
were
applied
to
its
products
as
well
in
the
mediæval
stage
of
evolution
of
the
production
of
commodities
the
question
as
to
the
owner
of
the
product
of
labor
could
not
arise
the
individual
producer
as
a
rule
had
from
raw
material
belonging
to
himself
and
generally
his
own
handiwork
produced
it
with
his
own
tools
by
the
labor
of
his
own
hands
or
of
his
family
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
appropriate
the
new
product
it
belonged
wholly
to
him
as
a
matter
of
course
his
property
in
the
product
was
therefore
based
his
own
even
where
external
help
was
used
this
was
as
a
rule
of
little
importance
and
very
generally
was
compensated
by
something
other
than
wages
the
apprentices
and
journeymen
of
the
guilds
worked
less
for
board
and
wages
than
for
education
in
order
that
they
might
become
master
craftsmen
themselves
then
came
the
concentration
of
the
means
of
production
and
of
the
producers
in
large
workshops
and
manufactories
their
transformation
into
actual
socialized
means
of
production
and
socialized
producers
but
the
socialized
producers
and
means
of
production
and
their
products
were
still
treated
after
this
change
just
as
they
had
been
before
as
the
means
of
production
and
the
products
of
individuals
hitherto
the
owner
of
the
instruments
of
labor
had
himself
appropriated
the
product
because
as
a
rule
it
was
his
own
product
and
the
assistance
of
others
was
the
exception
now
the
owner
of
the
instruments
of
labor
always
appropriated
to
himself
the
product
although
it
was
no
longer
product
but
exclusively
the
product
of
the
of
thus
the
products
now
produced
socially
were
not
appropriated
by
those
who
had
actually
set
in
motion
the
means
of
production
and
actually
produced
the
commodities
but
by
the
the
means
of
production
and
production
itself
had
become
in
essence
socialized
but
they
were
subjected
to
a
form
of
appropriation
which
presupposes
the
private
production
of
individuals
under
which
therefore
every
one
owns
his
own
product
and
brings
it
to
market
the
mode
of
production
is
subjected
to
this
form
of
appropriation
although
it
abolishes
the
conditions
upon
which
the
latter
rests
this
contradiction
which
gives
to
the
new
mode
of
production
its
capitalistic
character
the
germ
of
the
whole
of
the
social
antagonisms
of
the
greater
the
mastery
obtained
by
the
new
mode
of
production
over
all
important
fields
of
production
and
in
all
manufacturing
countries
the
more
it
reduced
individual
production
to
an
insignificant
residuum
more
clearly
was
brought
out
the
incompatibility
of
socialized
production
with
capitalistic
the
first
capitalists
found
as
we
have
said
alongside
of
other
forms
of
labor
for
them
on
the
market
but
it
was
exceptional
complementary
accessory
transitory
the
agricultural
laborer
though
upon
occasion
he
hired
himself
out
by
the
day
had
a
few
acres
of
his
own
land
on
which
he
could
at
all
events
live
at
a
pinch
the
guilds
were
so
organized
that
the
journeyman
of
became
the
master
of
but
all
this
changed
as
soon
as
the
means
of
production
became
socialized
and
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
capitalists
the
means
of
production
as
well
as
the
product
of
the
individual
producer
became
more
and
more
worthless
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
but
to
turn
under
the
capitalist
aforetime
the
exception
and
accessory
now
became
the
rule
and
basis
of
all
production
aforetime
complementary
it
now
became
the
sole
remaining
function
of
the
worker
the
for
a
time
became
a
for
life
the
number
of
these
permanent
was
further
enormously
increased
by
the
of
the
feudal
system
that
occurred
at
the
same
time
by
the
disbanding
of
the
retainers
of
the
feudal
lords
the
eviction
of
the
peasants
from
their
homesteads
etc
the
separation
was
made
complete
between
the
means
of
production
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
the
capitalists
on
the
one
side
and
the
producers
possessing
nothing
but
their
on
the
other
contradiction
between
socialized
production
and
capitalistic
appropriation
manifested
itself
as
the
antagonism
of
proletariat
and
we
have
seen
that
the
capitalistic
mode
of
production
thrust
its
way
into
a
society
of
of
individual
producers
whose
social
bond
was
the
exchange
of
their
products
but
every
society
based
upon
the
production
of
commodities
has
this
peculiarity
that
the
producers
have
lost
control
over
their
own
social
each
man
produces
for
himself
with
such
means
of
production
as
he
may
happen
to
have
and
for
such
exchange
as
he
may
require
to
satisfy
his
remaining
wants
no
one
knows
how
much
of
his
particular
article
is
coming
on
the
market
nor
how
much
of
it
will
be
wanted
no
one
knows
whether
his
individual
product
will
meet
an
actual
demand
whether
he
will
be
able
to
make
good
his
cost
of
production
or
even
to
sell
his
commodity
at
all
anarchy
reigns
in
socialized
production
but
the
production
of
commodities
like
every
other
form
of
production
has
its
peculiar
inherent
laws
inseparable
from
it
and
these
laws
work
despite
anarchy
in
and
through
anarchy
they
reveal
themselves
in
the
only
persistent
form
of
social
in
exchange
and
here
they
affect
the
individual
producers
as
compulsory
laws
of
competition
they
are
at
first
unknown
to
these
producers
themselves
and
have
to
be
discovered
by
them
gradually
and
as
the
result
of
experience
they
work
themselves
out
therefore
independently
of
the
producers
and
in
antagonism
to
them
as
inexorable
natural
laws
of
their
particular
form
of
production
the
product
governs
the
producers
in
mediæval
society
especially
in
the
earlier
centuries
production
was
essentially
directed
towards
satisfying
the
wants
of
the
individual
it
satisfied
in
the
main
only
the
wants
of
the
producer
and
his
family
where
relations
of
personal
dependence
existed
as
in
the
country
it
also
helped
to
satisfy
the
wants
of
the
feudal
lord
in
all
this
there
was
therefore
no
exchange
the
products
consequently
did
not
assume
the
character
of
commodities
the
family
of
the
peasant
produced
almost
everything
they
wanted
clothes
and
furniture
as
well
as
means
of
subsistence
only
when
it
began
to
produce
more
than
was
sufficient
to
supply
its
own
wants
and
the
payments
in
kind
to
the
feudal
lord
only
then
did
it
also
produce
commodities
this
surplus
thrown
into
socialized
exchange
and
offered
for
sale
became
commodities
the
artisans
of
the
towns
it
is
true
had
from
the
first
to
produce
for
exchange
but
they
also
themselves
supplied
the
greatest
part
of
their
own
individual
wants
they
had
gardens
and
plots
of
land
they
turned
their
cattle
out
into
the
communal
forest
which
also
yielded
them
timber
and
firing
the
women
spun
flax
wool
and
so
forth
production
for
the
purpose
of
exchange
production
of
commodities
was
only
in
its
infancy
hence
exchange
was
restricted
the
market
narrow
the
methods
of
production
stable
there
was
local
exclusiveness
without
local
unity
within
the
mark
in
the
country
in
the
town
the
guild
but
with
the
extension
of
the
production
of
commodities
and
especially
with
the
introduction
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
the
laws
of
hitherto
latent
came
into
action
more
openly
and
with
greater
force
the
old
bonds
were
loosened
the
old
exclusive
limits
broken
through
the
producers
were
more
and
more
turned
into
independent
isolated
producers
of
commodities
it
became
apparent
that
the
production
of
society
at
large
was
ruled
by
absence
of
plan
by
accident
by
anarchy
and
this
anarchy
grew
to
greater
and
greater
height
but
the
chief
means
by
aid
of
which
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
intensified
this
anarchy
of
socialized
production
was
the
exact
opposite
of
anarchy
it
was
the
increasing
organization
of
production
upon
a
social
basis
in
every
individual
productive
establishment
by
this
the
old
peaceful
stable
condition
of
things
was
ended
wherever
this
organization
of
production
was
introduced
into
a
branch
of
industry
it
brooked
no
other
method
of
production
by
its
side
the
field
of
labor
became
a
the
great
geographical
discoveries
and
the
colonization
following
upon
them
multiplied
markets
and
quickened
the
transformation
of
handicraft
into
manufacture
the
war
did
not
simply
break
out
between
the
individual
producers
of
particular
localities
the
local
struggles
begat
in
their
turn
national
conflicts
the
commercial
wars
of
the
seventeenth
and
the
eighteenth
centuries
finally
modern
industry
and
the
opening
of
the
made
the
struggle
universal
and
at
the
same
time
gave
it
an
virulence
advantages
in
natural
or
artificial
conditions
of
production
now
decide
the
existence
or
of
individual
capitalists
as
well
as
of
whole
industries
and
countries
he
that
falls
is
remorselessly
cast
aside
it
is
the
darwinian
struggle
of
the
individual
for
existence
transferred
from
nature
to
society
with
intensified
violence
the
conditions
of
existence
natural
to
the
animal
appear
as
the
final
term
of
human
development
the
contradiction
between
socialized
production
and
capitalistic
appropriation
now
presents
itself
as
antagonism
between
the
organization
of
production
in
the
individual
workshop
and
the
anarchy
of
production
in
society
the
capitalistic
mode
of
production
moves
in
these
two
forms
of
the
antagonism
immanent
to
it
from
its
very
origin
it
is
never
able
to
get
out
of
that
vicious
circle
which
fourier
had
already
discovered
what
fourier
could
not
indeed
see
in
his
time
is
that
this
circle
is
gradually
narrowing
that
the
movement
becomes
more
and
more
a
spiral
and
must
come
to
an
end
like
the
movement
of
the
planets
by
collision
with
the
center
it
is
the
compelling
force
of
anarchy
in
the
production
of
society
at
large
that
more
and
more
completely
turns
the
great
majority
of
men
into
proletarians
and
it
is
the
masses
of
the
proletariat
again
who
will
finally
put
an
end
to
anarchy
in
production
it
is
the
compelling
force
of
anarchy
in
social
production
that
turns
the
limitless
perfectibility
of
machinery
under
modern
industry
into
a
compulsory
law
by
which
every
individual
industrial
capitalist
must
perfect
his
machinery
more
and
more
under
penalty
of
ruin
but
the
perfecting
of
machinery
is
making
human
labor
superfluous
if
the
introduction
and
increase
of
machinery
means
the
displacement
of
millions
of
manual
by
a
few
improvement
in
machinery
means
the
displacement
of
more
and
more
of
the
themselves
it
means
in
the
last
instance
the
production
of
a
number
of
available
in
excess
of
the
average
needs
of
capital
the
formation
of
a
complete
industrial
reserve

as
i
called
it
in
available
at
the
times
when
industry
is
working
at
high
pressure
to
be
cast
out
upon
the
street
when
the
inevitable
crash
comes
a
constant
dead
weight
upon
the
limbs
of
the
in
its
struggle
for
existence
with
capital
a
regulator
for
the
keeping
of
wages
down
to
the
low
level
that
suits
the
interests
of
capital
thus
it
comes
about
to
quote
marx
that
machinery
becomes
the
most
powerful
weapon
in
the
war
of
capital
against
the
that
the
instruments
of
labor
constantly
tear
the
means
of
subsistence
out
of
the
hands
of
the
laborer
that
the
very
product
of
the
worker
is
turned
into
an
instrument
for
his
subjugation
thus
it
comes
about
that
the
economizing
of
the
instruments
of
labor
becomes
at
the
same
time
from
the
outset
the
most
reckless
waste
of
and
robbery
based
upon
the
normal
conditions
under
which
labor
functions
that
machinery
the
most
powerful
instrument
for
shortening
becomes
the
most
unfailing
means
for
placing
every
moment
of
the
laborer
time
and
that
of
his
family
at
the
disposal
of
the
capitalist
for
the
purpose
of
expanding
the
value
of
his
capital
capital
american

thus
it
comes
about
that
of
some
becomes
the
preliminary
condition
for
the
idleness
of
others
and
that
modern
industry
which
hunts
after
new
consumers
over
the
whole
world
forces
the
consumption
of
the
masses
at
home
down
to
a
starvation
minimum
and
in
doing
thus
destroys
its
own
home
market
the
law
that
always
equilibrates
the
relative
surplus
population
or
industrial
reserve
army
to
the
extent
and
energy
of
accumulation
this
law
rivets
the
laborer
to
capital
more
firmly
than
the
wedges
of
vulcan
did
prometheus
to
the
rock
it
establishes
an
accumulation
of
misery
corresponding
with
accumulation
of
capital
accumulation
of
wealth
at
one
pole
is
therefore
at
the
same
time
accumulation
of
misery
agony
of
toil
slavery
ignorance
brutality
mental
degradation
at
the
opposite
pole
on
the
side
of
the
class
that
produces

vol

p
and
to
expect
any
other
division
of
the
products
from
the
capitalistic
mode
of
production
is
the
same
as
expecting
the
electrodes
of
a
battery
not
to
decompose
acidulated
water
not
to
liberate
oxygen
at
the
positive
hydrogen
at
the
negative
pole
so
long
as
they
are
connected
with
the
battery
we
have
seen
that
the
perfectibility
of
modern
machinery
is
by
the
anarchy
of
social
production
turned
into
a
compulsory
law
that
forces
the
individual
industrial
capitalist
always
to
improve
his
machinery
always
to
increase
its
productive
force
the
bare
possibility
of
extending
the
field
of
production
is
transformed
for
him
into
a
similar
compulsory
law
the
enormous
expansive
force
of
modern
industry
compared
with
which
that
of
gases
is
mere
play
appears
to
us
now
as
a
for
expansion
both
qualitative
and
quantitative
that
laughs
at
all
resistance
such
resistance
is
offered
by
consumption
by
sales
by
the
markets
for
the
products
of
modern
industry
but
the
capacity
for
extension
extensive
and
intensive
of
the
markets
is
primarily
governed
by
quite
different
laws
that
work
much
less
energetically
the
extension
of
the
markets
can
not
keep
pace
with
the
extension
of
production
the
collision
becomes
inevitable
and
as
this
can
not
produce
any
real
solution
so
long
as
it
does
not
break
in
pieces
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
the
collisions
become
periodic
capitalist
production
has
begotten
another
vicious
circle
as
a
matter
of
fact
since
when
the
first
general
crisis
broke
out
the
whole
industrial
and
commercial
world
production
and
exchange
among
all
civilized
peoples
and
their
more
or
less
barbaric
are
thrown
out
of

once
every
ten

are

cash

factories

closed
the
mass
of
the

are
in
want
of
the

because
they
have
produced
too
much
of
the
means
of
subsistence
bankruptcy
follows
upon
bankruptcy
execution
upon
execution
the
stagnation
lasts
for
years
productive
forces
and

are
wasted
and
destroyed
wholesale
until
the
accumulated
mass
of
commodities
finally
filter
off
more
or
less
depreciated
in
value
until
production
and
exchange
gradually
begin
to
move
again
little
by
little
the
pace
quickens
it
becomes
a
trot
the
industrial
trot
breaks
into
a
canter
the
canter
in
turn
grows
into
the
headlong
gallop
of
a
perfect
steeplechase
of
industry
commercial
credit
and
speculation
which
finally
after
breakneck
leaps
ends
where
it
began
in
the
ditch
of
a
crisis
and
so
over
and
over
again
we
have
now
since
the
year
gone
through
this
five
times
and
at
the
present
moment
we
are
going
through
it
for
the
sixth
time
and
the
character
of
these
crises
is
so
clearly
defined
that
fourier
hit
all
of
them
off
when
he
described
the
first
as
a
crisis
from
plethora
in
these
crises
the
contradiction
between
socialized
production
and
capitalist
appropriation
ends
in
a
violent
explosion
the
circulation
of
commodities
is
for
the
time
being
stopped
money
the
means
of
circulation
becomes
a
hindrance
to
circulation
all
the
laws
of
production
and
circulation
of
commodities
are
turned
upside
down
the
economic
collision
has
reached
its
apogee
mode
of
production
is
in
rebellion
against
the
mode
of
the
fact
that
the
socialized
organization
of
production
within
the
factory
has
developed
so
far
that
it
has
become
incompatible
with
the
anarchy
of
production
in
society
which
exists
side
by
side
with
and
dominates
it
is
brought
home
to
the
capitalists
themselves
by
the
violent
concentration
of
capital
that
occurs
during
crises
through
the
ruin
of
many
large
and
a
still
greater
number
of
small
capitalists
the
whole
mechanism
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
breaks
down
under
the
pressure
of
the
productive
forces
its
own
creations
it
is
no
longer
able
to
turn
all
this
mass
of
means
of
production
into
capital
they
lie
fallow
and
for
that
very
reason
the
industrial
reserve
army
must
also
lie
fallow
means
of
production
means
of
subsistence
available
laborers
all
the
elements
of
production
and
of
general
wealth
are
present
in
abundance
but
abundance
becomes
the
source
of
distress
and
want
fourier
because
it
is
the
very
thing
that
prevents
the
transformation
of
the
means
of
production
and
subsistence
into
capital
for
in
capitalistic
society
the
means
of
production
can
only
function
when
they
have
undergone
a
preliminary
transformation
into
capital
into
the
means
of
exploiting
human
the
necessity
of
this
transformation
into
capital
of
the
means
of
production
and
subsistence
stands
like
a
ghost
between
these
and
the
workers
it
alone
prevents
the
coming
together
of
the
material
and
personal
levers
of
production
it
alone
forbids
the
means
of
production
to
function
the
workers
to
work
and
live
on
the
one
hand
therefore
the
capitalistic
mode
of
production
stands
convicted
of
its
own
incapacity
to
further
direct
these
productive
forces
on
the
other
these
productive
forces
themselves
with
increasing
energy
press
forward
to
the
removal
of
the
existing
contradiction
to
the
abolition
of
their
quality
as
capital
to
the
recognition
of
their
character
as
social
productive
this
rebellion
of
the
productive
forces
as
they
grow
more
and
more
powerful
against
their
quality
as
capital
this
stronger
and
stronger
command
that
their
social
character
shall
be
recognized
forces
the
capitalist
class
itself
to
treat
them
more
and
more
as
social
productive
forces
so
far
as
this
is
possible
under
capitalist
conditions
the
period
of
industrial
high
pressure
with
its
unbounded
inflation
of
credit
not
less
than
the
crash
itself
by
the
collapse
of
great
capitalist
establishments
tends
to
bring
about
that
form
of
the
socialization
of
great
masses
of
means
of
production
which
we
meet
with
in
the
different
kinds
of
companies
many
of
these
means
of
production
and
of
distribution
are
from
the
outset
so
colossal
that
like
the
railroads
they
exclude
all
other
forms
of
capitalistic
exploitation
at
a
further
stage
of
evolution
this
form
also
becomes
insufficient
the
producers
on
a
large
scale
in
a
particular
branch
of
industry
in
a
particular
country
unite
in
a
trust
a
union
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
production
they
determine
the
total
amount
to
be
produced
parcel
it
out
among
themselves
and
thus
enforce
the
selling
price
fixed
beforehand
but
trusts
of
this
kind
as
soon
as
business
becomes
bad
are
generally
liable
to
break
up
and
on
this
very
account
compel
a
yet
greater
concentration
of
association
the
whole
of
the
particular
industry
is
turned
into
one
gigantic
company
internal
competition
gives
place
to
the
internal
monopoly
of
this
one
company
this
has
happened
in
with
the
english
production
which
is
now
after
the
fusion
of
large
works
in
the
hands
of
one
company
conducted
upon
a
single
plan
and
with
a
capital
of
in
the
trusts
freedom
of
competition
changes
into
its
very
opposite
into
monopoly
and
the
production
without
any
definite
plan
of
capitalistic
society
capitulates
to
the
production
upon
a
definite
plan
of
the
invading
socialistic
society
certainly
this
is
so
far
still
to
the
benefit
and
advantage
of
the
capitalists
but
in
this
case
the
exploitation
is
so
palpable
that
it
must
break
down
no
nation
will
put
up
with
production
conducted
by
trusts
with
so
barefaced
an
exploitation
of
the
community
by
a
small
band
of
in
any
case
with
trusts
or
without
the
official
representative
of
capitalist
society
the
state
will
ultimately
have
to
undertake
the
direction
of
production
this
necessity
for
conversion
into
is
felt
first
in
the
great
institutions
for
intercourse
and
communication
the
postoffice
the
telegraphs
the
railways
if
the
crisis
demonstrate
the
incapacity
of
the
bourgeoisie
for
managing
any
longer
modern
productive
forces
the
transformation
of
the
great
establishments
for
production
and
distribution
into
companies
trusts
and
state
property
show
how
unnecessary
the
bourgeoisie
are
for
that
purpose
all
the
social
functions
of
the
capitalist
are
now
performed
by
salaried
employees
the
capitalist
has
no
further
social
function
than
that
of
pocketing
dividends
tearing
off
coupons
and
gambling
on
the
stock
exchange
where
the
different
capitalists
despoil
one
another
of
their
capital
at
first
the
capitalistic
mode
of
production
forces
out
the
workers
now
it
forces
out
the
capitalists
and
reduces
them
just
as
it
reduced
the
workers
to
the
ranks
of
the
surplus
population
although
not
immediately
into
those
of
the
industrial
reserve
army
but
the
transformation
either
into
companies
and
trusts
or
into
does
not
do
away
with
the
capitalistic
nature
of
the
productive
forces
in
the
companies
and
trusts
this
is
obvious
and
the
modern
state
again
is
only
the
organization
that
bourgeois
society
takes
on
in
order
to
support
the
external
conditions
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
against
the
encroachments
as
well
of
the
workers
as
of
individual
capitalists
the
modern
state
no
matter
what
its
form
is
essentially
a
capitalist
machine
the
state
of
the
capitalists
the
ideal
personification
of
the
total
national
capital
the
more
it
proceeds
to
the
taking
over
of
productive
forces
the
more
does
it
actually
become
the
national
capitalist
the
more
citizens
does
it
exploit
the
workers
remain
proletarians
the
capitalist
relation
is
not
done
away
with
it
is
rather
brought
to
a
head
but
brought
to
a
head
it
topples
over
of
the
productive
forces
is
not
the
solution
of
the
conflict
but
concealed
within
it
are
the
technical
conditions
that
form
the
elements
of
that
solution
this
solution
can
only
consist
in
the
practical
recognition
of
the
social
nature
of
the
modern
forces
of
production
and
therefore
in
the
harmonizing
the
modes
of
production
appropriation
and
exchange
with
the
socialized
character
of
the
means
of
production
and
this
can
only
come
about
by
society
openly
and
directly
taking
possession
of
the
productive
forces
which
have
outgrown
all
control
except
that
of
society
as
a
whole
the
social
character
of
the
means
of
production
and
of
the
products
reacts
against
the
producers
periodically
disrupts
all
production
and
exchange
acts
only
like
a
law
of
nature
working
blindly
forcibly
destructively
but
with
the
taking
over
by
society
of
the
productive
forces
the
social
character
of
the
means
of
production
and
of
the
products
will
be
utilized
by
the
producers
with
a
perfect
understanding
of
its
nature
and
instead
of
being
a
source
of
disturbance
and
periodical
collapse
will
become
the
most
powerful
lever
of
production
itself
active
social
forces
work
exactly
like
natural
forces
blindly
forcibly
destructively
so
long
as
we
do
not
understand
and
reckon
with
them
but
when
once
we
understand
them
when
once
we
grasp
their
action
their
direction
their
effects
it
depends
only
upon
ourselves
to
subject
them
more
and
more
to
our
own
will
and
by
means
of
them
to
reach
our
own
ends
and
this
holds
quite
especially
of
the
mighty
productive
forces
of
as
long
as
we
obstinately
refuse
to
understand
the
nature
and
the
character
of
these
social
means
of
action
and
this
understanding
goes
against
the
grain
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
and
its
defenders
so
long
these
forces
are
at
work
in
spite
of
us
in
opposition
to
us
so
long
they
master
us
as
we
have
shown
above
in
detail
but
when
once
their
nature
is
understood
they
can
in
the
hands
of
the
producers
working
together
be
transformed
from
master
demons
into
willing
servants
the
difference
is
as
that
between
the
destructive
force
of
electricity
in
the
lightning
of
the
storm
and
electricity
under
command
in
the
telegraph
and
the
voltaic
arc
the
difference
between
a
conflagration
and
fire
working
in
the
service
of
man
with
this
recognition
at
last
of
the
real
nature
of
the
productive
forces
of
the
social
anarchy
of
production
gives
place
to
a
social
regulation
of
production
upon
a
definite
plan
according
to
the
needs
of
the
community
and
of
each
individual
then
the
capitalist
mode
of
appropriation
in
which
the
product
enslaves
first
the
producer
and
then
the
appropriator
is
replaced
by
the
mode
of
appropriation
of
the
products
that
is
based
upon
the
nature
of
the
modern
means
of
production
upon
the
one
hand
direct
social
appropriation
as
means
to
the
maintenance
and
extension
of
production
on
the
other
direct
individual
appropriation
as
means
of
subsistence
and
of
enjoyment
whilst
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
more
and
more
completely
transforms
the
great
majority
of
the
population
into
proletarians
it
creates
the
power
which
under
penalty
of
its
own
destruction
is
forced
to
accomplish
this
revolution
whilst
it
forces
on
more
and
more
the
transformation
of
the
vast
means
of
production
already
socialized
into
state
property
it
shows
itself
the
way
to
accomplishing
this
revolution
proletariat
seizes
political
power
and
turns
the
means
of
production
into
state
but
in
doing
this
it
abolishes
itself
as
proletariat
abolishes
all
class
distinctions
and
class
antagonisms
abolishes
also
the
state
as
state
society
thus
far
based
upon
class
antagonisms
had
need
of
the
state
that
is
of
an
organization
of
the
particular
class
which
was
the
exploiting
class
an
organization
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
any
interference
from
without
with
the
existing
conditions
of
production
and
therefore
especially
for
the
purpose
of
forcibly
keeping
the
exploited
classes
in
the
condition
of
oppression
corresponding
with
the
given
mode
of
production
slavery
serfdom
the
state
was
the
official
representative
of
society
as
a
whole
the
gathering
of
it
together
into
a
visible
embodiment
but
it
was
this
only
in
so
far
as
it
was
the
state
of
that
class
which
itself
represented
for
the
time
being
society
as
a
whole
in
ancient
times
the
state
of
citizens
in
the
middle
ages
the
feudal
lords
in
our
own
time
the
bourgeoisie
when
at
last
it
becomes
the
real
representative
of
the
whole
of
society
it
renders
itself
unnecessary
as
soon
as
there
is
no
longer
any
social
class
to
be
held
in
subjection
as
soon
as
class
rule
and
the
individual
struggle
for
existence
based
upon
our
present
anarchy
in
production
with
the
collisions
and
excesses
arising
from
these
are
removed
nothing
more
remains
to
be
repressed
and
a
special
repressive
force
a
state
is
no
longer
necessary
the
first
act
by
virtue
of
which
the
state
really
constitutes
itself
the
representative
of
the
whole
of
society
the
taking
possession
of
the
means
of
production
in
the
name
of
society
this
is
at
the
same
time
its
last
independent
act
as
a
state
state
interference
in
social
relations
becomes
in
one
domain
after
another
superfluous
and
then
dies
out
of
itself
the
government
of
persons
is
replaced
by
the
administration
of
things
and
by
the
conduct
of
processes
of
production
the
state
is
not
abolished
dies
this
gives
the
measure
of
the
value
of
the
phrase
a
free
state
both
as
to
its
justifiable
use
at
times
by
agitators
and
as
to
its
ultimate
scientific
insufficiency
and
also
of
the
demands
of
the
anarchists
for
the
abolition
of
the
state
out
of
hand
since
the
historical
appearance
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
the
appropriation
by
society
of
all
the
means
of
production
has
often
been
dreamed
of
more
or
less
vaguely
by
individuals
as
well
as
by
sects
as
the
ideal
of
the
future
but
it
could
become
possible
could
become
a
historical
necessity
only
when
the
actual
conditions
for
its
realization
were
there
like
every
other
social
advance
it
becomes
practicable
not
by
men
understanding
that
the
existence
of
classes
is
in
contradiction
to
justice
equality
not
by
the
mere
willingness
to
abolish
these
classes
but
by
virtue
of
certain
new
economic
conditions
the
separation
of
society
into
an
exploiting
and
an
exploited
class
a
ruling
and
an
oppressed
class
was
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
deficient
and
restricted
development
of
production
in
former
times
so
long
as
the
total
social
labor
only
yields
a
produce
which
but
slightly
exceeds
that
barely
necessary
for
the
existence
of
all
so
long
therefore
as
labor
engages
all
or
almost
all
the
time
of
the
great
majority
of
the
members
of
society
so
long
of
necessity
this
society
is
divided
into
classes
side
by
side
with
the
great
majority
exclusively
bond
slaves
to
labor
arises
a
class
freed
from
directly
productive
labor
which
looks
after
the
general
affairs
of
society
the
direction
of
labor
state
business
law
science
art
etc
it
is
therefore
the
law
of
division
of
labor
that
lies
at
the
basis
of
the
division
into
classes
but
this
does
not
prevent
this
division
into
classes
from
being
carried
out
by
means
of
violence
and
robbery
trickery
and
fraud
it
does
not
prevent
the
ruling
class
once
having
the
upper
hand
from
consolidating
its
power
at
the
expense
of
the
from
turning
their
social
leadership
into
an
intensified
exploitation
of
the
masses
but
if
upon
this
showing
division
into
classes
has
a
certain
historical
justification
it
has
this
only
for
a
given
period
only
under
given
social
conditions
it
was
based
upon
the
insufficiency
of
production
it
will
be
swept
away
by
the
complete
development
of
modern
productive
forces
and
in
fact
the
abolition
of
classes
in
society
presupposes
a
degree
of
historical
evolution
at
which
the
existence
not
simply
of
this
or
that
particular
ruling
class
but
of
any
ruling
class
at
all
and
therefore
the
existence
of
class
distinction
itself
has
become
an
obsolete
anachronism
it
presupposes
therefore
the
development
of
production
carried
out
to
a
degree
at
which
appropriation
of
the
means
of
production
and
of
the
products
and
with
this
of
political
domination
of
the
monopoly
of
culture
and
of
intellectual
leadership
by
a
particular
class
of
society
has
become
not
only
superfluous
but
economically
politically
intellectually
a
hindrance
to
development
this
point
is
now
reached
their
political
and
intellectual
bankruptcy
is
scarcely
any
longer
a
secret
to
the
bourgeoisie
themselves
their
economic
bankruptcy
recurs
regularly
every
ten
years
in
every
crisis
society
is
suffocated
beneath
the
weight
of
its
own
productive
forces
and
products
which
it
can
not
use
and
stands
helpless
face
to
face
with
the
absurd
contradiction
that
the
producers
have
nothing
to
consume
because
consumers
are
wanting
the
expansive
force
of
the
means
of
production
bursts
the
bonds
that
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
had
imposed
upon
them
their
deliverance
from
these
bonds
is
the
one
precondition
for
an
unbroken
development
of
the
productive
forces
and
therewith
for
a
practically
unlimited
increase
of
production
itself
nor
is
this
all
the
socialized
appropriation
of
the
means
of
production
does
away
not
only
with
the
present
artificial
restrictions
upon
production
but
also
with
the
positive
waste
and
devastation
of
productive
forces
and
products
that
are
at
the
present
time
the
inevitable
concomitants
of
production
and
that
reach
their
height
in
the
crises
further
it
sets
free
for
the
community
at
large
a
mass
of
means
of
production
and
of
products
by
doing
away
with
the
senseless
extravagance
of
the
ruling
classes
of
and
their
political
representatives
the
possibility
of
securing
for
every
member
of
society
by
means
of
socialized
production
an
existence
not
only
fully
sufficient
materially
and
becoming
day
by
day
more
full
but
an
existence
guaranteeing
to
all
the
free
development
and
exercise
of
their
physical
and
mental
faculties
this
possibility
is
now
for
the
first
time
here
but
is
with
the
seizing
of
the
means
of
production
by
society
production
of
commodities
is
done
away
with
and
simultaneously
the
mastery
of
the
product
over
the
producer
anarchy
in
social
production
is
replaced
by
systematic
definite
organization
the
struggle
for
individual
existence
disappears
then
for
the
first
time
man
in
a
certain
sense
is
finally
marked
off
from
the
rest
of
the
animal
kingdom
and
emerges
from
mere
animal
conditions
of
existence
into
really
human
ones
the
whole
sphere
of
the
conditions
of
life
which
environ
man
and
which
have
hitherto
ruled
man
now
comes
under
the
dominion
and
control
of
man
who
for
the
first
time
becomes
the
real
conscious
lord
of
nature
because
he
has
now
become
master
of
his
own
social
organization
the
laws
of
his
own
social
action
hitherto
standing
face
to
face
with
man
as
laws
of
nature
foreign
to
and
dominating
him
will
then
be
used
with
full
understanding
and
so
mastered
by
him
man
own
social
organization
hitherto
confronting
him
as
a
necessity
imposed
by
nature
and
history
now
becomes
the
result
of
his
own
free
action
the
extraneous
objective
forces
that
have
hitherto
governed
history
pass
under
the
control
of
man
himself
only
from
that
time
will
man
himself
more
and
more
consciously
make
his
own
history
only
from
that
time
will
the
social
causes
set
in
movement
by
him
have
in
the
main
and
in
a
constantly
growing
measure
the
results
intended
by
him
it
is
the
ascent
of
man
from
the
kingdom
of
necessity
to
the
kingdom
of
freedom
let
us
briefly
sum
up
our
sketch
of
historical
evolution
i
individual
production
on
a
small
scale
means
of
production
adapted
for
individual
use
hence
primitive
ungainly
petty
dwarfed
in
action
production
for
immediate
consumption
either
of
the
producer
himself
or
of
his
feudal
lord
only
where
an
excess
of
production
over
this
consumption
occurs
is
such
excess
offered
for
sale
enters
into
exchange
production
of
commodities
therefore
only
in
its
infancy
but
already
it
contains
within
itself

the

transformation
of

at
first
by
means
of
simple
and
manufacture

of
the
means
of
production
hitherto
scattered
into
great
workshops
as
a
consequence
their
transformation
from
individual
to
social
means
of
production
a
transformation
which
does
not
on
the
whole
affect
the
form
of
exchange
the
old
forms
of
appropriation
remain
in
force
the
capitalist
appears
in
his
capacity
as
owner
of
the
means
of
production
he
also
appropriates
the
products
and
turns
them
into
commodities
production
has
become
a
act
exchange
and
appropriation
continue
to
be
acts
the
acts
of
individuals
social
product
is
appropriated
by
the
individual
fundamental
contradiction
whence
arise
all
the
contradictions
in
which
our
present
day
society
moves
and
which
modern
industry
brings
to
light
a
severance
of
the
producer
from
the
means
of
production
condemnation
of
the
worker
to
for

between
the

and

and

the

of

complemented
by

but
these
two
levers
of

and
of
social
are
unable
to
work
together
because
the
capitalist
form
of
production
prevents
the
productive
forces
from
working
and
the
products
from
circulating
unless
they
are

turned
into

their
very
superabundance

grown
into

to

iii
solution
of
the
contradictions
the
proletariat
seizes
the
public
power
and
by
means
of
this
transforms
the
socialized
means
of
production
slipping
from
the
hands
of
the
bourgeoisie
into
public
property
by
this
act
the
proletariat
frees
the
means
of
production
from
the
character
of
capital
they
have
thus
far
borne
and
gives
their
socialized
character
complete
freedom
to
work
itself
out
socialized
production
upon
a
predetermined
plan
becomes
henceforth
possible
the
development
of
production
makes
the
existence
of
different
classes
of
society
thenceforth
an
anachronism
in
proportion
as
anarchy
in
social
production
vanishes
the
political
authority
of
the
state
dies
out
man
at
last
the
master
of
his
own
form
of
social
organization
becomes
at
the
same
time
the
lord
over
nature
his
own
master
free
to
accomplish
this
act
of
universal
emancipation
is
the
historical
mission
of
the
modern
proletariat
to
thoroughly
comprehend
the
historical
conditions
and
thus
the
very
nature
of
this
act
to
impart
to
the
now
oppressed
proletarian
class
a
full
knowledge
of
the
conditions
and
of
the
meaning
of
the
momentous
act
it
is
called
upon
to
accomplish
this
is
the
task
of
the
theoretical
expression
of
the
proletarian
movement
scientific
socialism
footnotes
it
is
hardly
necessary
in
this
connection
to
point
out
that
even
if
the
form
of
appropriation
remains
the
same
the
of
the
appropriation
is
just
as
much
revolutionized
as
production
is
by
the
changes
described
above
it
is
of
course
a
very
different
matter
whether
i
appropriate
to
myself
my
own
product
or
that
of
another
note
in
passing
that
which
contains
the
whole
capitalistic
mode
of
production
in
embryo
is
very
ancient
in
a
sporadic
scattered
form
it
existed
for
centuries
alongside
of
but
the
embryo
could
duly
develop
into
the
capitalistic
mode
of
production
only
when
the
necessary
historical
preconditions
had
been
furnished
the
condition
of
the
in
england
sonnenschein
i
say
have
to
for
only
when
the
means
of
production
and
distribution
have
outgrown
the
form
of
management
by
companies
and
when
therefore
the
taking
them
over
by
the
state
has
become
inevitable
only
then
even
if
it
is
the
state
of
that
effects
this
is
there
an
economic
advance
the
attainment
of
another
step
preliminary
to
the
taking
over
of
all
productive
forces
by
society
itself
but
of
late
since
bismarck
went
in
for
of
industrial
establishments
a
kind
of
spurious
socialism
has
arisen
degenerating
now
and
again
into
something
of
flunkeyism
that
without
more
ado
declares
even
of
the
bismarckian
sort
to
be
socialistic
certainly
if
the
taking
over
by
the
state
of
the
tobacco
industry
is
socialistic
then
napoleon
and
metternich
must
be
numbered
among
the
founders
of
socialism
if
the
belgian
state
for
quite
ordinary
political
and
financial
reasons
itself
constructed
its
chief
railway
lines
if
bismarck
not
under
any
economic
compulsion
took
over
for
the
state
the
chief
prussian
lines
simply
to
be
the
better
able
to
have
them
in
hand
in
case
of
war
to
bring
up
the
railway
employees
as
voting
cattle
for
the
government
and
especially
to
create
for
himself
a
new
source
of
income
independent
of
parliamentary
votes
this
was
in
no
sense
a
socialistic
measure
directly
or
indirectly
consciously
or
unconsciously
otherwise
the
royal
maritime
company
the
royal
porcelain
manufacture
and
even
the
regimental
tailor
of
the
army
would
also
be
socialistic
institutions
or
even
as
was
seriously
proposed
by
a
sly
dog
in
frederick
william
iii
reign
the
taking
over
by
the
state
of
the
brothels
a
few
figures
may
serve
to
give
an
approximate
idea
of
the
enormous
expansive
force
of
the
modern
means
of
production
even
under
capitalist
pressure
according
to
giffen
the
total
wealth
of
great
britain
and
ireland
amounted
in
round
numbers
in
to
to
to
as
an
instance
of
the
squandering
of
means
of
production
and
of
products
