the
flight
of
the
lone
star
the
air
above
the
brazilian
jungles
along
the
dark
waters
of
the
rio
branco
in
northern
brazil
was
full
of
sound
the
roar
and
thunder
of
many
motors
beat
down
upon
the
sea
of
waving
treetops
until
it
seemed
to
stir
them
into
animated
life
a
formation
of
great
planes
was
passing
over
two
natives
in
a
small
dugout
on
the
river
dropped
their
paddles
into
their
wooden
canoe
then
sat
staring
upward
the
river
s
current
swept
them
beneath
the
branches
of
a
dead
mango
tree
one
of
them
reached
up
to
snap
off
a
brittle
branch
breaking
pieces
from
this
branch
he
placed
them
one
by
one
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
when
there
were
pieces
he
stopped
to
sit
as
if
in
a
trance
watching
those
great
birds
go
sweeping
on
presently
his
companion
grunted
then
pointed
at
the
sky
upstream
the
first
native
again
looked
skyward
then
placed
two
more
sticks
with
the
others
making
forty
in
all
then
he
drawled
a
few
native
words
that
in
our
language
mean
one
of
these
big
birds
is
very
this
native
was
old
he
had
lived
long
beneath
the
overhanging
treetops
he
knew
the
ways
of
birds
and
men
but
not
of
airplanes
for
all
that
he
was
right
one
of
these
flying
things
of
metal
was
sick
very
sick
even
as
he
said
the
words
there
came
a
sudden
burst
of
thunder
and
the
larger
of
the
two
planes
the
one
that
was
not
sick
a
ship
so
well
and
a
native
s
eyes
shone
at
sight
of
it
pulled
away
from
its
slow
sick
companion
and
went
speeding
along
over
the
forest
that
lined
the
downsweep
of
the
river
gone
said
the
native
now
this
one
will
his
eyes
shone
with
a
new
light
once
on
the
rio
negro
he
had
seen
one
of
these
birds
there
had
been
much
on
that
plane
that
he
had
coveted
and
these
last
two
planes
were
not
bombers
but
transport
planes
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
speeding
plane
had
not
deserted
its
companion
for
in
a
short
time
it
came
roaring
back
and
a
girl
s
voice
speaking
into
a
radio
said
there
s
a
rather
large
clearing
about
fifty
miles
down
think
you
can
make
it
we
ll
have
to
try
came
in
a
man
s
strong
even
tone
we
re
on
one
motor
now
the
other
is
cutting
out
on
me
can
t
tell
how
soon
it
will
quit
we
ll
tag
along
came
in
the
girl
s
voice
if
you
make
if
we
get
that
far
we
ll
try
a
landing
was
the
answer
and
if
anything
goes
you
ll
fly
right
the
man
s
voice
was
harsh
insistent
remember
don
t
say
it
sparky
the
girl
s
voice
rose
sharp
as
an
alarmed
bird
s
don
t
say
it
all
right
all
right
the
man
s
voice
grumbled
into
the
tropical
air
then
i
won
t
say
it
all
the
all
the
same
if
you
go
down
there
we
re
coming
right
down
after
you
the
girl
insisted
you
know
what
our
orders
were
to
fly
in
pairs
if
one
plane
is
disabled
its
mate
must
go
to
the
rescue
all
other
planes
must
go
straight
on
we
re
on
a
mission
of
destruction
that
s
all
we
know
it
s
urgent
we
must
go
through
okay
sister
that
s
why
you
should
fly
right
but
we
won
the
girl
spoke
quietly
if
you
crack
up
we
ll
be
right
down
this
ship
has
control
i
can
land
her
on
a
but
don
t
i
never
forget
the
girl
snapped
now
go
on
down
there
and
try
your
luck
it
s
all
that
s
left
to
what
d
he
the
girl
who
sat
in
the
seat
beside
the
girl
who
had
carried
on
that
spirited
conversation
drawled
what
secret
sorry
janet
was
the
slow
reply
you
ve
heard
of
military
secrets
i
suppose
for
pete
s
sake
mary
mason
yes
of
course
i
have
but
i
don
t
this
is
one
of
mary
mason
the
little
girl
who
piloted
a
big
plane
favored
her
with
a
smile
after
that
save
for
the
slow
drone
of
motors
there
was
quiet
in
the
cabin
a
tense
sort
of
calm
such
as
comes
before
a
storm
after
a
time
the
janet
said
sparky
s
motors
didn
t
stop
all
by
of
course
they
didn
t
sparky
s
too
good
a
pilot
for
he
sure
is
it
s
the
work
of
the
enemy
that
s
what
it
is
he
knows
he
s
after
us
after
you
and
sparky
don
and
me
he
s
got
us
coming
down
in
a
jungle
and
we
re
only
just
out
of
good
old
and
think
of
the
dizzy
miles
still
ahead
of
us
and
the
enemy
dogging
our
luck
all
the
way
i
thought
of
him
before
i
started
mary
replied
quietly
let
him
do
his
worst
we
ll
win
you
ll
see
for
the
swift
powerful
transport
plane
flown
by
mary
mason
the
distance
to
that
native
clearing
on
the
rio
branco
was
just
a
jump
but
she
did
not
jump
instead
she
followed
doggedly
on
behind
her
limping
companion
and
as
she
followed
she
found
time
to
think
those
were
long
long
thoughts
she
was
a
member
of
the
wafs
women
s
auxiliary
ferrying
squadron
this
slender
girl
with
the
flashing
black
eyes
and
fingers
for
six
wintry
months
she
had
flown
planes
from
east
to
west
from
north
to
south
and
all
the
way
back
again
sometimes
these
planes
were
transport
planes
or
bombers
with
comfortable
heated
cabins
more
often
they
were
trainers
or
fighters
she
flew
them
in
wind
rain
and
snow
mile
after
weary
mile
in
lonely
solitude
she
had
gone
roaring
through
the
night
sky
to
arrive
at
last
at
her
destination
only
to
be
ushered
aboard
an
airways
plane
and
hurried
back
again
it
was
hard
she
said
to
janet
janes
her
companion
sure
it
was
the
other
girl
agreed
looks
as
if
this
would
be
perhaps
mary
answered
but
just
think
in
the
past
two
days
it
s
been
san
francisco
to
denver
to
chicago
to
miami
to
caracas
and
then
to
the
heart
of
a
jungle
where
headhunters
beat
on
hollow
logs
inviting
their
friends
to
a
janet
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
this
will
be
just
a
pause
mary
insisted
stoutly
after
that
it
will
be
para
to
dakar
in
africa
dakar
to
egypt
and
the
pyramids
egypt
to
under
the
persian
moon
janet
sang
softly
and
then
watch
mary
exclaimed
there
s
the
clearing
sparky
has
spotted
it
he
s
preparing
to
circle
he
s
going
down
suddenly
mary
set
her
motors
thundering
after
climbing
steeply
she
leveled
off
to
stare
down
at
the
clearing
he
didn
t
go
down
not
yet
janet
informed
her
no
there
are
people
running
from
that
row
of
native
huts
he
d
hit
they
re
like
ants
coming
from
an
ant
hill
they
don
t
seem
oh
but
they
are
mary
exclaimed
every
human
life
is
important
besides
if
sparky
killed
just
one
of
them
our
lives
wouldn
t
be
worth
a
penny
we
re
in
the
probably
not
a
white
man
within
a
hundred
or
perhaps
a
i
wish
we
might
go
a
suggestion
of
strain
crept
into
janet
s
voice
oh
but
we
can
mary
s
plane
was
circling
slowly
now
of
course
we
couldn
t
go
on
she
told
herself
not
even
if
sparky
through
her
racing
mind
whirled
memories
of
other
days
those
bad
days
of
winter
convoy
in
america
there
had
been
only
of
them
wafs
and
so
much
work
to
do
always
on
her
return
from
a
long
hard
trip
muddy
chilled
through
and
if
he
chanced
to
be
in
she
had
found
sparky
waiting
in
his
car
to
whisk
her
away
to
her
barracks
and
after
that
to
a
glorious
hot
meal
thick
juicy
steaks
french
fries
lemon
pie
and
barrels
of
hot
coffee
she
whispered
and
now
sparky
was
down
there
below
her
in
his
disabled
plane
waiting
waiting
for
the
last
darting
spot
to
glide
from
those
huts
into
the
bush
that
lay
beyond
no
they
could
not
go
on
not
even
for
the
she
spoke
aloud
then
checked
herself
just
in
time
he
can
t
climb
she
said
to
janet
he
can
only
circle
and
if
his
other
motor
quits
he
may
go
crashing
straight
down
there
janet
breathed
now
there
s
no
one
yes
just
one
a
very
small
black
spot
moving
oh
so
slowly
went
weaving
this
way
then
that
toward
the
forest
a
child
mary
exclaimed
how
sparky
would
hate
hitting
a
child
now
janet
breathed
no
mary
groaned
one
more
a
smaller
it
seemed
an
eternity
before
this
last
child
had
reached
safety
of
a
sudden
the
plane
beneath
them
lunged
downward
there
they
go
janet
gasped
while
mary
s
clutching
fingers
fairly
bit
into
the
stick
but
no
sparky
s
plane
seemed
to
shudder
no
doubt
his
motor
had
quit
then
gone
on
again
why
doesn
t
he
go
down
mary
groaned
here
take
the
plane
she
gave
janet
her
place
just
circle
with
long
swift
strides
she
reached
the
plane
s
door
there
she
braced
herself
then
stood
watching
the
plane
below
he
s
going
down
she
whispered
it
was
true
circling
slowly
cautiously
sparky
nursed
his
disabled
plane
at
last
into
a
smooth
glide
that
brought
him
swiftly
down
he
s
out
too
far
she
groaned
he
s
afraid
there
s
just
one
more
native
child
there
she
exclaimed
he
s
down
she
saw
the
big
plane
bump
hard
then
again
it
did
not
heel
over
but
went
gliding
straight
on
he
made
it
she
screamed
aloud
oh
glory
bright
hopes
sped
through
her
mind
the
defective
motors
would
soon
be
repaired
before
the
natives
returned
they
would
once
again
rise
high
above
the
jungle
and
speed
away
to
rejoin
their
convoy
she
had
begun
to
feel
dreadfully
lonesome
away
from
all
that
thundering
flight
at
para
they
would
be
united
and
her
thoughts
broke
off
her
lips
parted
in
a
scream
that
did
not
come
of
a
sudden
the
ship
down
there
on
the
ground
gliding
forward
had
whirled
half
about
its
right
wing
crumpled
it
turned
toward
the
black
waters
of
the
river
after
gliding
forward
half
the
distance
to
those
threatening
waters
it
came
to
a
sudden
halt
then
crumpled
into
a
heap
with
lips
parted
she
kept
her
eyes
glued
upon
the
plane
would
it
be
set
on
fire
a
slow
smoke
rose
but
no
flames
a
figure
came
tumbling
from
the
plane
one
more
she
whispered
just
one
more
the
figure
that
had
appeared
remained
motionless
for
a
space
of
seconds
then
he
leaped
forward
to
the
wreck
one
of
them
is
hurt
she
called
to
janet
keep
it
was
true
for
soon
the
single
figure
appeared
once
more
this
time
bearing
a
limp
burden
janet
mary
exclaimed
as
she
resumed
control
of
the
plane
we
re
going
down
this
said
janet
is
a
large
plane
larger
than
sparky
and
easier
to
control
this
said
mary
proudly
is
the
lone
star
the
only
plane
of
its
kind
in
the
world
it
s
almost
priceless
janet
agreed
yes
and
its
cargo
is
really
priceless
mary
might
have
added
but
did
not
for
that
was
her
military
secret
hers
and
sparky
s
the
had
told
just
that
to
her
before
they
took
off
i
am
putting
it
on
your
plane
the
had
said
because
your
lone
star
is
the
fastest
strongest
most
dependable
transport
plane
we
have
in
our
outfit
and
i
have
given
the
plane
to
you
because
other
than
two
pilots
that
can
not
be
spared
you
are
the
only
one
who
knows
her
and
can
take
her
safely
this
she
realized
had
been
high
praise
hers
was
a
grave
responsibility
but
sparky
her
good
pal
was
down
there
was
he
the
one
who
had
been
injured
she
had
no
way
of
knowing
i
m
going
down
she
repeated
softly
chapter
ii
savages
and
the
night
as
the
big
plane
circled
drifting
slowly
down
mary
leaned
over
to
say
in
a
deep
impressive
voice
janet
if
we
crash
and
there
s
a
spark
of
life
in
you
get
out
quick
and
run
crawl
anything
get
away
who
wouldn
t
janet
stared
if
the
ship
gets
on
fire
the
gas
tanks
will
explode
it
s
worse
than
that
mary
confided
this
ship
is
mined
janet
stared
it
certainly
is
and
by
our
own
people
this
is
one
ship
our
enemies
will
never
take
apart
piece
by
piece
nor
its
cargo
either
in
case
of
a
crash
it
will
be
torn
to
that
s
terrible
janet
s
voice
was
husky
not
as
bad
as
it
seems
was
the
slow
reply
only
fire
will
set
off
the
explosives
bumping
won
t
do
it
there
s
a
fuse
too
i
know
right
where
it
is
no
they
ll
never
get
the
lone
star
or
her
cargo
and
there
s
nothing
they
d
like
half
as
much
to
do
but
they
won
t
get
her
never
never
and
now
she
breathed
here
we
go
as
her
ship
glided
down
even
in
this
moment
when
her
own
fate
seemed
to
hang
in
the
balance
on
the
walls
of
mary
s
mind
was
painted
a
picture
that
would
not
soon
be
erased
it
was
as
if
her
first
glimpse
of
a
tropical
jungle
the
waving
palms
the
slow
rolling
black
river
the
native
huts
the
sloping
hillside
all
bathed
in
a
beautiful
sunset
had
been
painted
there
by
some
great
artist
and
then
her
ship
s
landing
wheels
touched
the
broad
path
of
the
natives
coming
in
closer
to
the
natives
shacks
she
had
avoided
the
treacherous
hillside
and
suddenly
there
she
was
graceful
as
a
plover
with
wings
outspread
the
lone
star
came
to
rest
we
made
it
mary
gave
vent
to
a
heavy
sigh
of
relief
but
now
she
was
up
and
away
in
the
same
breath
for
the
solving
of
one
difficult
problem
had
only
served
to
bring
her
closer
to
another
there
had
been
two
men
in
the
bomber
when
it
crashed
sparky
ames
and
don
nelson
one
had
been
injured
which
one
and
how
badly
she
had
to
know
i
m
going
over
there
she
exclaimed
as
she
leaped
from
the
plane
at
the
same
time
pointing
up
the
hill
okay
i
ll
watch
this
plane
janet
said
yes
i
think
that
s
wise
you
never
can
illustration
lone
star
came
to
rest
at
the
foot
of
the
mary
cast
an
apprehensive
glance
at
the
long
row
of
native
houses
homes
of
a
hundred
people
she
thought
perfectly
wild
but
now
nothing
stirred
there
with
long
quick
strides
she
made
her
way
where
one
man
bent
over
the
prostrate
form
of
another
when
she
was
half
way
there
she
saw
the
kneeling
man
turn
his
head
then
she
knew
oh
sparky
she
exclaimed
you
re
safe
sure
what
d
you
think
the
tall
strongly
built
young
man
with
black
kinky
hair
grinned
didn
t
she
was
closer
now
it
would
have
been
terrible
if
you
had
been
seriously
injured
you
her
voice
dropped
secret
cargo
yes
i
but
don
she
exclaimed
is
he
badly
injured
she
was
standing
beside
sparky
now
i
can
t
tell
yet
was
the
slow
answer
i
have
the
courage
to
hope
not
he
got
a
bang
on
the
head
that
knocked
him
out
i
ve
felt
him
over
pretty
carefully
no
bones
broken
is
my
guess
but
he
keeps
groaning
his
hand
comes
up
to
his
chest
got
a
cracked
rib
or
two
i
shouldn
t
that
s
bad
isn
t
it
bad
enough
but
it
might
be
worse
anyway
our
plane
can
never
be
repaired
not
here
it
can
and
how
will
you
ever
get
it
out
that
s
it
he
agreed
looks
as
if
we
re
least
our
plane
is
guess
we
ll
have
to
go
it
alone
mary
just
you
and
it
s
the
way
the
chief
would
want
his
voice
went
husky
that
secret
cargo
must
go
through
at
all
cost
those
were
the
orders
how
do
you
feel
about
that
how
would
you
feel
about
going
over
the
top
somewhere
in
africa
she
challenged
i
wouldn
t
think
i
d
just
go
same
as
any
other
soldier
it
s
the
same
with
me
now
she
replied
soberly
a
soldier
too
well
perhaps
not
quite
but
i
m
serving
in
a
soldier
s
plane
a
mighty
good
one
too
any
man
in
my
shoes
would
have
to
have
had
five
hundred
hours
in
the
and
so
where
duty
calls
or
he
quoted
i
shall
always
hope
to
be
there
she
saluted
but
look
she
exclaimed
don
is
trying
to
sit
up
he
must
not
do
that
no
no
old
man
not
yet
once
again
sparky
was
at
his
comrade
s
side
gently
pushing
him
down
am
i
happened
came
in
thick
tones
you
re
here
and
we
re
here
sparky
and
mary
said
sparky
oh
then
s
all
the
injured
man
settled
back
i
ll
go
get
some
pneumatic
pillows
mary
volunteered
yes
and
something
hot
to
drink
sparky
suggested
that
will
help
a
mary
was
away
when
don
had
fully
recovered
consciousness
and
had
been
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
they
gathered
around
him
for
a
council
of
war
it
s
getting
dark
said
sparky
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
it
will
be
darker
than
a
stack
of
black
cats
in
this
land
the
dawn
comes
up
like
thunder
and
the
sun
blinks
out
in
the
same
and
there
s
no
moon
said
janet
all
of
which
means
we
re
here
for
the
night
said
mary
sparky
her
voice
seemed
a
little
strained
what
kind
of
a
country
is
this
good
country
sparky
laughed
no
but
really
we
ve
got
to
face
facts
mary
insisted
truth
is
said
sparky
i
don
t
know
about
the
upper
waters
of
the
amazon
or
the
people
who
live
here
do
the
rest
of
you
there
came
a
chorus
of
no
s
all
right
then
we
ll
be
prepared
for
the
worst
and
hope
for
the
they
scattered
fast
enough
when
they
saw
us
coming
down
don
volunteered
that
was
natural
said
sparky
it
is
also
natural
to
suppose
that
in
the
end
they
ll
defend
their
homes
they
may
come
back
in
the
night
there
are
two
loose
machine
guns
in
each
plane
the
major
had
them
put
there
for
just
such
a
time
as
and
for
the
time
when
we
ll
be
over
battle
zones
mary
added
we
may
be
just
now
we
re
in
a
jungle
so
we
ll
limber
up
the
guns
said
sparky
how
about
you
ladies
fixing
up
a
little
chow
sure
oh
sure
we
ll
do
that
was
the
quick
response
by
the
time
sparky
had
two
guns
set
up
in
the
lone
star
which
he
figured
might
in
the
event
of
an
attack
in
force
be
used
as
a
fort
and
had
dragged
the
other
guns
to
the
spot
a
short
distance
away
which
they
had
chosen
as
a
camp
site
darkness
had
fallen
and
the
girls
had
coffee
brewing
over
a
cheerful
fire
say
this
is
great
sparky
exclaimed
i
ve
always
wanted
to
go
camping
but
never
had
time
well
don
drawled
you
ve
got
about
ten
hours
now
with
nothing
else
to
do
but
unless
we
re
attacked
janet
supplemented
with
a
shudder
why
bring
that
up
mary
laughed
dinner
is
about
ready
to
serve
let
s
make
it
a
a
date
it
is
sparky
agreed
their
grub
box
contained
a
little
more
than
iron
rations
sweet
potatoes
and
sausages
each
served
from
a
can
big
round
white
crackers
a
square
of
butter
and
aromatic
coffee
with
real
sugar
and
canned
cream
made
up
the
bulk
of
their
satisfying
meal
dessert
was
little
wild
bananas
and
huge
grapefruit
that
were
sweet
as
oranges
these
came
from
the
edge
of
the
jungle
um
janet
breathed
that
was
really
a
yes
and
listen
mary
exclaimed
low
what
was
that
really
something
different
a
low
rolling
sound
had
come
drifting
in
out
of
the
night
a
native
drum
was
sparky
s
instant
answer
as
they
listened
from
farther
away
came
the
answer
talking
drums
mary
whispered
i
never
expected
to
hear
she
was
hearing
them
all
the
same
and
coming
as
they
did
out
of
the
night
with
the
low
murmur
of
the
dark
rushing
river
as
their
accompaniment
they
sounded
weird
indeed
now
came
a
roar
close
at
hand
sharp
and
clear
and
now
from
far
away
with
the
booms
blended
into
one
long
roar
night
in
the
jungle
mary
whispered
crawl
into
your
ship
and
forget
it
sparky
suggested
we
ll
be
here
in
the
oh
i
never
could
do
that
janet
exclaimed
all
right
said
sparky
then
you
girls
keep
the
first
watch
and
i
ll
sleep
but
first
we
ll
fix
don
up
as
comfortable
as
we
it
was
don
whose
eyes
first
closed
in
slumber
with
soft
pneumatic
cushions
under
him
and
a
mosquito
canopy
to
protect
him
and
a
soothing
capsule
to
allay
his
pain
he
was
asleep
before
the
others
could
arrange
for
the
watches
of
the
night
just
as
sparky
crept
away
to
the
lone
star
for
three
winks
a
bright
golden
moon
came
rolling
along
the
fringe
of
the
forest
oh
that
s
better
janet
exclaimed
was
it
it
was
not
long
before
every
shadow
cast
by
the
moon
appeared
to
move
and
the
darkened
grass
houses
seemed
alive
with
people
ghosts
mary
whispered
ghosts
of
native
men
and
women
who
lived
here
long
before
we
were
be
still
janet
whispered
i
heard
a
voice
it
was
somewhere
down
the
river
listen
as
they
listened
a
voice
seemed
to
ask
why
why
why
that
mary
laughed
low
that
s
a
big
old
tree
frog
he
lives
in
a
pool
of
green
water
in
a
hollow
tree
way
up
high
i
read
about
it
once
if
you
drink
the
water
he
lives
in
you
ll
go
i
think
you
might
janet
whispered
what
do
you
suppose
he
wants
to
know
with
his
eternal
why
perhaps
he
wants
to
know
why
we
are
here
why
my
father
is
out
somewhere
in
and
why
my
two
brothers
are
in
australia
said
janet
do
you
know
the
answer
no
said
mary
at
least
not
all
the
answer
i
only
know
that
we
must
keep
on
being
here
and
in
africa
egypt
syria
india
china
wherever
we
re
sent
until
this
terrible
war
is
over
and
all
our
loved
ones
can
come
home
yes
that
s
right
but
mary
you
know
we
were
volunteers
we
didn
t
have
to
join
up
and
above
all
we
didn
t
have
to
go
on
this
long
long
trip
so
far
from
this
mary
knew
was
true
they
had
in
truth
volunteered
twice
joining
the
wafs
was
purely
on
a
voluntary
basis
once
they
were
in
they
were
expected
to
ferry
planes
from
place
to
place
in
their
own
country
but
a
sudden
urgent
call
had
come
from
china
for
forty
planes
all
but
two
of
them
bombers
there
were
not
enough
men
available
so
volunteers
were
called
from
among
the
women
all
of
us
volunteered
except
those
who
had
children
janet
said
thinking
aloud
who
wouldn
t
it
s
what
i
ve
always
wanted
mary
s
voice
rose
a
little
when
sparky
used
to
come
in
after
a
week
s
absence
and
say
hello
sister
i
m
just
back
from
russia
i
was
burned
up
with
envy
the
next
week
it
would
be
africa
and
after
that
london
and
there
we
were
plowing
through
the
sky
to
kansas
city
des
moines
or
peoria
and
now
she
breathed
we
are
on
our
way
to
china
by
way
of
africa
india
and
all
the
we
janet
exclaimed
do
they
expect
just
you
and
me
to
fly
the
atlantic
alone
why
not
mary
asked
teasingly
oh
she
added
sparky
told
me
tonight
that
he
and
i
would
go
on
nice
going
janet
s
tone
was
a
trifle
cold
oh
janet
mary
put
out
a
hand
don
t
look
at
it
that
way
there
s
something
aboard
the
lone
star
that
just
has
to
go
through
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
what
it
is
i
can
t
because
i
don
t
know
naturally
it
s
better
that
a
man
pilot
the
plane
one
who
has
flown
the
atlantic
many
times
it
would
be
natural
too
that
don
should
go
if
he
were
able
oh
sure
janet
was
her
old
friendly
self
again
i
understand
we
ll
have
to
get
don
to
a
hospital
somewhere
and
i
ll
stay
to
see
him
yes
and
you
may
get
to
china
yet
both
of
oh
china
janet
yawned
just
now
i
d
love
to
find
myself
on
broadway
in
little
old
new
york
with
a
run
to
denver
waiting
for
me
in
the
morning
it
s
a
funny
world
isn
t
it
it
certainly
is
mary
agreed
at
one
sparky
climbed
down
from
the
lone
star
s
cabin
go
on
up
there
and
sleep
was
his
gruff
but
kindly
order
we
ve
got
a
tough
day
they
obeyed
while
janet
wrapped
herself
up
in
blankets
mary
spread
out
an
eiderdown
robe
her
father
had
once
brought
from
the
far
north
and
they
were
soon
fast
asleep
three
hours
later
just
as
the
moon
was
nearing
the
crest
of
the
ridge
lying
off
to
the
west
mary
crept
down
from
the
plane
to
join
sparky
in
his
vigil
don
still
asleep
she
asked
sure
is
he
s
lucky
to
be
able
to
perhaps
he
s
not
so
badly
injured
after
bad
enough
sparky
sighed
we
ll
have
to
get
him
over
to
the
hospital
at
para
then
you
and
i
ll
have
to
hop
the
little
channel
that
lies
between
south
america
and
africa
your
cargo
must
go
secret
cargo
she
whispered
wonder
what
it
could
some
new
weapons
for
destroying
japs
perhaps
a
new
type
of
gun
or
just
a
badly
needed
medicine
for
the
soldiers
up
there
in
burma
they
say
it
s
plenty
bad
up
there
this
time
of
year
anyway
that
secret
cargo
must
go
ours
not
to
reason
ours
but
to
do
and
die
she
parodied
who
knows
his
voice
sounded
solemn
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
the
enemy
has
our
number
i
ve
been
looking
at
my
motors
they
ve
been
tampered
with
emery
dust
in
the
pistons
or
but
where
could
that
have
happened
she
exclaimed
caracas
but
there
were
soldiers
guarding
every
soldiers
of
foreign
lands
are
sometimes
traitors
so
too
are
mechanics
who
tune
up
the
motors
we
ll
have
to
be
on
our
guard
every
moment
this
time
we
were
over
the
land
the
next
it
may
be
the
we
ll
watch
she
vowed
day
and
night
night
and
but
it
s
all
so
strange
she
mused
after
a
time
why
should
there
be
a
sudden
demand
for
so
many
big
planes
in
china
there
are
rumors
of
a
plan
to
bomb
oh
i
d
like
to
be
in
on
that
wouldn
t
we
all
but
it
s
just
a
rumor
i
ve
heard
that
we
are
to
attack
burma
from
two
try
to
the
burma
road
that
would
be
glorious
then
i
ve
heard
the
japs
are
going
after
russia
and
that
these
bombers
are
for
our
russian
allies
all
these
are
rumors
we
may
never
know
the
truth
that
s
the
way
it
is
in
for
a
time
after
that
nothing
but
the
low
rush
of
the
river
and
the
croaking
of
the
why
frog
disturbed
the
silence
of
the
jungle
then
suddenly
mary
whispered
listen
singing
sparky
whispered
back
after
a
tense
moment
natives
on
the
the
moon
has
gone
behind
the
hills
they
re
coming
back
the
natives
are
yes
and
let
them
come
sparky
rattled
his
gun
if
they
re
peaceful
things
will
be
all
right
if
he
rattled
the
gun
once
more
this
is
war
the
lone
star
and
her
secret
cargo
must
go
through
after
that
for
some
time
they
sat
there
in
silence
listening
to
the
wild
native
chant
that
with
every
movement
grew
louder
then
suddenly
the
dark
waters
of
the
river
came
all
alight
the
long
canoes
had
turned
a
bend
of
the
river
in
each
canoe
were
a
dozen
torches
held
aloft
mary
counted
nine
canoes
in
all
to
her
heightened
imagination
each
canoe
seemed
a
hundred
feet
in
length
do
they
come
like
that
when
they
want
to
fight
she
asked
gripping
sparky
s
arm
hard
who
knows
was
the
brief
reply
chapter
iii
battling
a
spy
for
a
time
sparky
and
mary
sat
in
the
dark
silently
watching
the
procession
of
great
canoes
to
mary
it
was
a
fascinating
and
fearsome
spectacle
suddenly
sparky
let
out
a
low
exclamation
thunderation
at
that
he
jumped
from
the
log
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
to
kick
at
their
campfire
until
the
coals
glowed
red
again
then
gathering
up
an
armful
of
leaves
he
threw
them
on
the
coals
for
a
space
of
seconds
a
column
of
dense
smoke
rose
straight
toward
the
stars
then
as
the
whole
mass
burst
into
flames
all
about
them
the
native
huts
the
airplanes
and
the
jungle
at
their
backs
stood
out
in
bold
relief
sparky
mary
exclaimed
shrinking
back
why
did
you
do
that
i
ll
meet
any
man
half
way
was
the
reply
that
is
anyone
but
hitler
s
mob
and
those
dirty
little
but
those
men
are
savages
who
knows
what
s
a
savage
anyway
sparky
s
voice
sounded
strange
every
man
is
a
human
being
those
are
men
brazil
is
our
ally
at
war
and
this
is
brazil
when
men
come
to
you
singing
and
waving
torches
you
just
must
meet
them
half
by
this
time
the
dugout
canoes
were
pulling
up
to
the
shore
the
chant
had
ceased
in
its
place
was
only
the
murmur
of
voices
the
torches
still
flamed
soon
a
procession
came
moving
like
a
great
twisting
glowing
serpent
toward
the
campfire
sparky
mary
crowded
close
it
s
too
much
i
can
t
stand
it
steady
girl
sparky
s
voice
was
calm
his
hands
still
gripped
the
as
the
procession
came
closer
they
saw
that
most
of
the
natives
were
all
but
naked
that
some
carried
rifles
and
others
spears
and
that
they
were
led
by
a
little
man
wearing
striped
trousers
a
bright
jacket
and
a
sword
they
did
not
pause
until
as
if
in
a
drill
they
had
ranged
themselves
in
three
semicircular
rows
before
the
fire
the
little
man
stood
at
the
center
and
three
steps
before
them
mary
tried
to
think
what
one
swing
of
sparky
s
spitting
would
do
to
those
rows
and
shuddered
at
last
the
little
man
spoke
his
words
came
in
slow
precise
english
you
are
from
the
united
states
illustration
and
mary
watched
the
natives
come
that
s
right
pardner
sparky
agreed
the
united
states
and
brazil
are
united
against
a
common
right
as
our
ally
i
salute
the
little
man
s
hand
shot
up
in
a
salute
thrilled
to
her
fingertips
mary
managed
to
join
sparky
in
a
salute
the
little
man
spoke
a
single
word
in
a
strange
tongue
and
instantly
the
circle
of
natives
dropped
to
their
knees
in
a
position
of
ease
just
like
that
mary
whispered
she
wanted
terribly
to
cry
with
a
courteous
gesture
the
little
man
invited
mary
and
sparky
to
resume
their
positions
on
the
log
then
he
sat
down
at
sparky
s
side
i
he
said
am
doctor
salazar
i
have
studied
in
your
country
being
not
unskilled
in
the
medical
profession
and
also
possessed
of
an
interest
in
native
life
i
was
sent
to
this
place
that
i
might
make
friends
of
the
natives
this
you
will
see
i
ve
you
are
wonderful
mary
exclaimed
and
you
are
a
yes
that
is
my
one
member
of
our
party
has
been
injured
how
seriously
we
can
t
tell
sparky
explained
i
am
at
your
service
shall
we
have
a
look
at
this
man
they
rose
and
walked
over
to
don
s
side
he
had
been
sleeping
but
now
stared
at
them
with
questioning
eyes
we
have
brought
you
a
doctor
said
mary
and
not
a
medicine
man
either
sparky
laughed
with
practised
fingers
the
little
man
went
over
don
from
head
to
toe
no
bones
broken
was
his
diagnosis
probably
three
ribs
cracked
when
his
chest
is
taped
up
he
can
be
good
we
ll
take
him
to
para
in
the
in
that
large
plane
i
suppose
said
the
doctor
and
the
other
plane
asked
the
doctor
if
your
men
will
help
us
we
can
load
the
motors
in
our
good
plane
said
sparky
it
shall
be
done
you
are
americans
i
am
an
american
we
all
are
you
re
right
we
all
are
mary
exclaimed
the
motors
shall
go
said
the
doctor
but
that
which
remains
sparky
shrugged
in
a
war
there
will
always
be
my
men
and
i
can
take
it
in
pieces
we
shall
float
it
to
the
rio
negro
there
it
can
be
put
on
a
steamer
it
should
be
in
para
perhaps
in
two
weeks
so
there
you
the
doctor
made
another
bow
indeed
you
are
wonderful
mary
exclaimed
it
is
all
for
the
great
cause
speed
the
the
doctor
clicked
his
heels
and
saluted
the
salute
was
returned
in
good
measure
and
so
it
was
arranged
scarcely
had
the
red
of
dawn
disappeared
from
the
sky
when
the
lone
star
rose
to
greet
the
sun
then
began
winging
its
way
toward
the
city
of
para
four
hours
later
far
above
the
clouds
they
flew
across
the
broad
waters
of
the
para
river
at
its
mouth
then
began
circling
down
to
the
city
of
para
first
to
catch
mary
s
eye
was
the
city
s
ancient
fortifications
as
they
circled
lower
she
caught
the
gleam
of
the
cathedral
s
roof
the
governor
s
palace
and
other
public
buildings
stood
out
from
among
the
royal
palms
last
but
not
least
were
the
hundreds
of
homes
each
with
its
lovely
little
garden
surrounded
by
palms
the
broad
public
garden
caught
her
eye
then
the
airport
so
they
came
circling
down
to
ask
for
and
receive
permission
to
land
as
soon
as
they
were
down
an
ambulance
was
called
and
don
with
janet
in
attendance
was
whisked
away
to
the
hospital
i
m
staying
with
the
ship
sparky
said
to
mary
sure
mary
agreed
can
t
take
any
chances
this
that
s
right
besides
there
s
a
lot
to
be
done
the
motors
from
my
ship
must
be
unloaded
and
arrangements
made
for
the
repairing
and
assembling
of
the
other
plane
when
it
it
does
sparky
added
gloomily
oh
it
will
mary
exclaimed
i
d
trust
that
little
doctor
with
my
okay
we
ll
hope
for
it
sparky
agreed
you
just
hop
out
somewhere
and
get
yourself
a
good
square
one
good
brazilian
feed
she
laughed
that
s
it
one
dinner
in
every
land
that
s
our
i
ll
bring
you
a
dinner
on
a
tray
buy
tray
dishes
and
all
when
we
get
going
you
can
eat
the
food
and
throw
the
dishes
into
the
we
ll
be
taking
off
in
just
a
couple
of
hours
if
i
can
get
our
papers
all
cleared
up
so
don
t
admire
the
scenery
too
don
t
worry
i
ll
be
right
even
at
this
strange
corner
of
the
world
the
war
was
much
in
evidence
soldiers
were
all
over
the
field
army
planes
from
many
lands
came
and
went
at
the
gate
stood
two
guards
a
smile
and
her
uniform
were
all
the
passes
she
needed
not
so
the
youth
in
tattered
clothes
who
stood
outside
the
gate
gazing
in
at
mary
s
big
plane
that
s
some
plane
you
ve
he
tipped
his
seedy
hat
you
re
an
american
she
smiled
so
at
least
i
used
to
he
did
not
smile
now
well
i
guess
you
d
say
i
m
sort
of
a
tropical
tramp
been
down
here
for
five
but
his
voice
rose
boy
that
plane
of
yours
must
be
the
best
there
is
ever
do
any
flying
she
asked
she
should
be
going
on
but
this
boy
interested
her
ve
flown
quite
a
bit
here
and
in
why
don
t
you
join
up
your
outfit
he
grinned
broadly
you
re
a
oh
but
there
are
a
lot
more
men
than
women
flying
for
the
ferry
but
then
her
voice
dropped
they
probably
wouldn
t
take
why
his
shoulders
squared
that
s
just
it
was
the
quick
reply
you
re
too
fit
they
d
want
you
for
combat
duty
you
can
t
make
our
outfit
unless
you
re
too
old
for
combat
or
there
s
something
a
little
wrong
with
you
sparky
my
has
a
hole
in
his
eardrum
combat
wouldn
t
take
him
but
ferry
but
say
she
gave
him
a
good
square
look
why
don
t
you
ship
back
to
and
get
into
a
uniform
afraid
to
go
back
no
just
ashamed
i
ran
away
my
mother
s
a
peach
she
really
go
back
and
sign
up
get
into
uniform
then
breeze
back
home
you
ll
make
a
well
he
broke
short
off
to
leap
sideways
take
three
flying
steps
then
swing
his
arm
to
knock
something
from
a
stranger
s
hand
without
knowing
why
mary
followed
on
the
run
it
was
lucky
that
she
did
for
the
angry
man
flashed
a
knife
he
slashed
at
the
boy
once
and
drew
blood
his
second
blow
better
aimed
might
have
been
fatal
had
not
mary
done
a
flying
leap
to
knock
his
arm
high
in
the
air
and
send
the
knife
flying
away
instantly
they
were
surrounded
by
soldiers
the
youth
and
the
man
were
seized
two
soldiers
stepped
toward
mary
what
eez
zis
all
about
one
asked
really
don
t
know
was
her
faltering
answer
the
soldier
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
you
might
have
been
keeled
now
you
say
i
know
it
s
a
fact
for
all
she
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
do
things
like
that
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
s
about
the
boy
broke
in
holding
up
a
bloody
arm
that
man
he
pointed
to
the
stranger
is
a
spy
he
was
taking
pictures
of
that
big
plane
that
s
an
american
plane
and
i
m
an
american
he
can
t
get
by
with
that
good
for
you
the
words
were
on
mary
s
lips
she
did
not
say
them
instead
she
bent
down
and
picked
up
something
black
that
gave
off
a
bright
gleam
he
s
telling
the
truth
she
said
in
as
quiet
a
tone
as
she
could
command
here
s
the
proof
his
camera
that
boy
knocked
it
from
his
it
s
a
lie
the
man
snarled
i
never
saw
the
thing
before
it
s
one
of
those
costly
miniature
cameras
mary
went
on
it
takes
a
hundred
pictures
as
easy
as
firing
a
machine
gun
and
sometimes
it
s
twice
as
she
handed
it
to
the
soldier
have
the
film
developed
the
pictures
will
speak
for
it
s
a
lie
the
man
growled
trying
to
break
away
he
calls
himself
joe
stevens
now
said
the
boy
swabbing
his
bleeding
arm
with
a
soiled
handkerchief
i
knew
him
in
manos
that
was
before
we
entered
the
war
he
was
a
rubber
trader
then
they
called
him
we
ll
look
into
this
said
the
officer
to
mary
he
said
this
boy
needs
attention
there
s
a
red
cross
station
up
that
way
a
i
ll
have
him
fixed
up
said
mary
and
will
you
vouch
for
his
return
to
the
station
at
the
airport
gate
come
on
then
the
soldier
spoke
to
stevens
who
had
once
been
schnieder
then
they
marched
away
it
s
nothing
the
boy
said
hiding
his
hand
i
ll
fix
no
said
mary
we
re
going
to
the
station
then
you
re
going
to
take
me
to
some
place
where
i
can
get
a
swell
oh
so
that
s
how
it
is
his
face
lit
up
come
on
then
let
s
an
hour
later
with
his
arm
neatly
bandaged
the
boy
sat
opposite
her
smiling
the
grand
dinner
he
had
promised
was
coming
to
an
end
it
had
been
all
she
had
dreamed
of
and
more
they
were
having
their
black
coffee
and
ice
cream
taking
a
pencil
from
her
purse
she
wrote
on
a
card
then
handed
it
to
him
that
she
said
is
my
permanent
address
i
m
going
on
a
rather
long
journey
i
may
not
come
back
we
never
know
but
if
i
do
i
d
like
to
have
something
nice
waiting
for
me
send
me
your
picture
when
you
get
in
uniform
won
t
you
well
he
swallowed
hard
yes
i
will
if
i
make
that
was
all
he
said
at
the
airport
gate
he
put
out
a
hand
for
a
good
stout
handclasp
ships
that
pass
in
the
his
voice
was
husky
yes
she
replied
quickly
fighting
ships
that
are
going
to
put
things
to
rights
in
this
old
world
of
at
that
she
turned
to
march
away
by
the
way
he
called
after
her
just
in
case
you
might
like
to
know
my
name
s
jerry
thanks
she
smiled
then
without
thinking
she
added
i
ll
be
seeing
one
more
hour
passed
just
as
they
were
ready
to
take
off
mary
brought
sparky
his
dinner
on
a
tray
it
s
paid
for
tray
and
all
she
said
good
then
let
s
he
led
the
way
into
the
cabin
they
say
it
brings
good
luck
if
you
throw
your
dishes
into
the
sea
he
laughed
mary
did
not
laugh
one
word
sparky
had
spoken
stuck
in
her
mind
luck
she
whispered
to
herself
we
may
need
it
all
kinds
of
she
could
not
quite
forget
that
they
had
already
lost
one
plane
just
now
she
had
visions
of
herself
on
a
rubber
raft
in
casting
a
line
in
the
vain
hope
of
catching
a
fish
chapter
iv
the
big
hop
shaking
herself
free
from
these
disturbing
thoughts
mary
checked
the
no
card
sparky
handed
her
and
said
it
s
okay
then
watched
him
check
his
gas
working
together
like
the
team
that
they
were
they
threw
on
a
switch
here
to
release
it
then
snapped
on
another
there
only
to
reach
for
one
more
switch
mary
nodded
to
the
mechanic
waiting
outside
he
nodded
back
then
held
up
a
fire
bottle
one
engine
coughed
then
the
other
mary
reached
for
two
small
levers
sparky
eased
the
throttle
back
to
one
thousand
then
nodded
to
the
mechanic
the
mechanic
removed
the
chocks
from
before
their
wheels
sparky
eased
his
plane
slowly
down
the
runway
they
picked
up
speed
they
sped
and
then
that
magic
word
up
and
they
were
away
they
were
not
off
for
africa
not
yet
their
way
led
along
the
coast
toward
natal
the
jumping
off
place
sometimes
they
were
far
out
over
the
sea
and
then
again
the
beauty
of
tropical
forests
lay
beneath
them
it
was
a
glorious
trip
just
at
sunset
a
white
spot
appeared
before
them
and
mary
knew
that
this
lap
of
their
journey
was
nearing
its
end
there
are
good
american
mechanics
at
natal
sparky
said
they
ll
give
the
old
ship
a
real
going
over
we
ll
get
a
few
hours
of
good
sound
sleep
and
we
ll
be
mary
thrilled
to
the
tips
of
her
toes
off
for
the
old
world
we
re
going
abroad
sparky
just
think
really
going
abroad
it
s
just
another
trip
for
me
sparky
laughed
low
but
if
you
get
a
kick
out
of
it
that
s
just
get
a
kick
out
of
it
she
exclaimed
of
course
i
will
if
the
time
ever
comes
when
i
no
longer
get
a
kick
out
of
things
i
ll
be
ready
to
guess
you
re
right
at
that
sparky
agreed
but
then
what
s
a
thrill
to
you
may
be
just
another
headache
for
someone
else
i
too
have
my
big
let
me
know
when
you
have
one
she
asked
i
might
at
that
he
agreed
there
s
a
good
little
hotel
run
just
for
american
women
at
natal
he
said
run
by
an
old
lady
called
aunt
aunt
like
a
parrot
mary
laughed
she
s
got
one
too
said
sparky
she
keeps
a
nice
place
i
ll
run
over
there
soon
s
we
land
set
your
alarm
for
i
ll
be
after
you
at
two
we
ll
not
sleep
going
over
so
don
t
lie
awake
thinking
hit
the
pillow
fast
and
hard
that
s
my
fast
and
hard
it
shall
be
mary
agreed
at
that
they
began
circling
for
a
landing
at
that
night
they
had
breakfast
sitting
on
stools
in
a
little
stand
lots
of
coffee
and
plenty
of
oatmeal
with
cream
was
mary
s
order
and
good
brown
toast
with
bacon
sparky
added
nervous
he
asked
as
her
fingers
shook
a
bit
that
s
fine
i
wouldn
t
give
a
plugged
nickel
for
a
partner
that
didn
t
have
nerves
it
s
part
of
our
equipment
keeps
us
on
our
toes
but
you
re
not
scared
just
a
don
t
be
he
grinned
it
s
only
a
pretty
long
she
smiled
back
at
him
eighteen
hundred
miles
plus
and
water
under
us
all
the
way
what
could
be
sweeter
and
we
ll
be
flying
out
to
meet
the
oh
sparky
she
exclaimed
that
does
sound
swell
i
never
did
like
night
just
to
think
that
we
re
hurrying
away
to
meet
the
sun
that
is
just
popping
along
to
meet
us
that
sure
is
the
food
was
excellent
so
she
ordered
a
lunch
to
go
and
producing
a
gallon
thermos
bottle
ordered
it
filled
with
coffee
that
said
sparky
will
be
frozen
solid
we
re
going
to
be
flying
up
there
among
the
oh
no
it
won
t
she
gave
him
a
sly
smile
there
are
some
advantages
in
having
a
gal
for
a
one
of
the
advantages
is
a
hot
lunch
half
way
tasting
is
he
was
a
skeptic
wait
and
i
ll
ten
minutes
later
they
were
at
the
airport
and
with
their
arrival
a
burden
seemed
to
fall
upon
mary
s
slender
shoulders
she
had
started
out
enough
to
do
with
her
companion
janet
what
no
woman
of
the
ferry
command
had
ever
done
before
to
ferry
a
big
ship
half
way
round
the
world
what
was
more
their
ship
was
to
carry
a
light
cargo
of
vital
war
equipment
now
her
companion
was
gone
sparky
had
taken
her
place
they
had
started
out
forty
planes
strong
now
one
plane
was
out
of
action
and
were
a
full
day
ahead
of
them
we
ll
have
to
go
it
alone
she
said
speaking
half
to
herself
and
half
to
sparky
that
s
it
sparky
agreed
the
fates
have
arranged
illustration
we
ll
have
to
go
it
alone
said
and
our
cargo
is
priceless
that
s
what
the
major
priceless
he
agreed
it
s
quite
as
important
that
it
should
arrive
safely
as
well
perhaps
as
it
is
for
all
those
big
bombers
ahead
of
us
to
go
through
but
mary
his
voice
changed
don
t
think
of
it
that
way
you
ll
tighten
up
if
you
do
that
might
prove
fatal
you
have
to
be
relaxed
flexible
ready
for
anything
that
s
how
you
have
to
ll
try
to
forget
that
cargo
she
agreed
well
he
breathed
here
s
our
ship
all
primed
up
and
rarin
to
go
come
on
let
s
climb
once
again
he
handed
her
the
form
one
card
this
time
she
studied
it
with
supreme
care
it
told
her
that
the
engines
were
in
perfect
order
that
the
tubes
of
carbon
dioxide
snow
for
fire
prevention
were
full
as
were
their
oxygen
tubes
and
that
fuel
and
oil
supply
were
at
their
maximum
when
she
had
studied
the
card
she
nodded
to
sparky
and
at
once
he
began
thumbing
the
oil
gage
do
you
always
check
your
oil
supply
she
asked
always
was
the
emphatic
reply
regardless
of
the
report
on
the
card
test
your
fuel
if
you
want
to
keep
on
living
you
ll
always
do
that
men
are
human
an
attendant
may
read
your
report
note
that
your
no
tank
is
short
a
hundred
gallons
record
that
he
is
putting
that
amount
in
then
discover
that
he
has
but
fifty
gallons
to
spare
he
forgets
to
record
the
change
right
out
over
an
endless
forest
your
engine
coughs
and
dies
no
see
she
replied
soberly
gas
and
oil
okay
sparky
murmured
then
in
silence
he
flipped
on
the
ignition
and
gas
set
the
electric
primer
going
counted
five
allowed
it
to
snap
off
then
nodded
to
his
mechanic
the
mechanic
grinned
as
he
held
up
a
fire
extinguisher
that
s
one
more
thing
sparky
warned
don
t
ever
start
twin
motors
unless
someone
is
near
with
the
fire
bottle
and
don
t
you
let
me
do
it
is
that
so
bad
mary
asked
worst
in
the
world
sparky
exploded
if
one
motor
fails
to
start
popping
you
ll
have
a
fire
in
your
exhaust
pipe
a
fire
bottle
will
put
it
out
in
a
hurry
but
if
there
s
no
fire
bottle
your
ship
will
go
up
in
smoke
a
fire
of
high
octane
gas
is
something
to
think
about
he
started
the
energizing
wheel
going
waited
a
space
of
seconds
then
threw
on
the
switch
first
the
right
engine
began
coughing
mary
worked
her
two
levers
that
enriched
the
fuel
mixture
sparky
eased
his
throttle
back
to
one
thousand
then
nodded
to
the
mechanic
the
mechanic
removed
the
chocks
from
before
the
wheels
and
the
big
ship
started
to
move
we
re
off
mary
thought
with
a
little
choking
sensation
at
her
throat
sparky
cursed
some
small
foreign
plane
that
taxiing
across
the
field
caused
him
to
swing
sharply
to
the
right
looks
like
he
did
that
on
purpose
said
mary
may
have
at
that
was
the
reply
there
are
some
hitler
sympathizers
down
this
way
well
he
sighed
ten
seconds
later
i
fooled
him
now
the
runway
s
clear
so
here
we
the
powerful
motors
roared
in
unison
they
rose
sharply
toward
the
stars
ten
minutes
later
they
were
out
over
the
sea
and
still
slowly
climbing
the
sea
is
so
black
mary
thought
the
sky
is
all
filled
with
night
hours
of
this
how
can
i
bear
it
then
as
a
sense
of
real
joy
the
feeling
that
must
come
to
a
bird
passed
over
her
she
whispered
but
we
re
rushing
east
to
meet
the
get
on
your
oxygen
mask
sparky
commanded
crashing
into
her
dream
we
re
going
up
where
there
isn
t
any
weather
and
mighty
little
their
masks
were
attached
by
rubber
tubes
to
pipes
running
from
the
oxygen
storage
tanks
when
mary
had
pulled
on
her
mask
she
sighed
ah
that
s
great
isn
t
it
wonderful
that
they
should
mould
our
masks
to
fit
our
faces
it
s
a
grand
idea
sparky
agreed
but
you
ll
get
tired
enough
of
it
before
we
greet
that
dawn
of
yours
we
re
going
up
to
twenty
thousand
feet
and
stay
there
for
hours
we
ll
make
better
time
that
way
and
there
ll
be
no
bumps
you
can
even
sleep
if
you
want
sleep
mary
s
voice
rose
i
d
never
do
that
suppose
you
fell
asleep
something
happened
to
you
i
never
get
sleepy
and
nothing
ever
sparky
settled
back
in
his
place
talk
when
you
feel
like
it
he
drawled
i
like
the
sound
of
your
oh
you
do
mary
laughed
they
climbed
to
twenty
thousand
feet
it
seemed
to
mary
that
she
could
feel
the
intense
cold
creeping
through
their
cabin
s
walls
and
her
suit
of
wool
leather
and
fur
but
this
she
knew
was
pure
imagination
as
they
zoomed
along
through
the
blue
with
the
black
ocean
far
below
and
the
stars
apparently
scattered
all
about
them
she
felt
very
little
desire
to
talk
she
just
wanted
to
think
her
mind
went
back
to
childhood
days
happy
days
they
had
been
those
days
with
her
father
school
shut
out
much
of
this
and
then
had
come
college
college
vacations
found
her
flying
first
with
her
father
then
alone
she
had
learned
about
airplane
engines
from
the
ground
up
and
had
even
become
an
expert
with
a
machine
gun
that
she
told
herself
was
providence
a
dress
rehearsal
for
as
if
he
had
been
reading
her
thoughts
sparky
said
mary
there
were
a
dozen
or
more
who
volunteered
for
this
job
you
re
doing
now
i
wouldn
t
want
you
to
think
i
don
t
like
your
work
i
do
you
re
swell
but
how
come
they
picked
on
you
you
re
about
the
youngest
of
the
that
s
right
mary
agreed
but
i
ve
had
more
hours
of
solo
flight
than
any
of
them
fifteen
hundred
to
be
fifteen
hundred
sparky
whistled
practically
flew
from
your
cradle
when
i
was
sixteen
you
see
dad
is
as
much
at
home
in
the
air
as
on
the
and
you
take
after
him
sure
why
not
what
s
more
i
know
a
lot
about
airplane
engines
and
machine
handy
man
with
tools
eh
sparky
drawled
try
mary
did
not
laugh
who
knows
this
job
of
ours
may
call
for
all
the
tricks
we
know
before
it
s
guess
that
s
right
sparky
agreed
and
i
sure
am
glad
you
re
on
the
after
that
they
once
more
lapsed
into
silence
the
miles
and
the
stars
flew
by
there
were
times
when
mary
was
plagued
by
the
illusion
that
somehow
their
ship
had
stopped
traveling
that
they
were
there
suspended
in
space
their
motors
roaring
but
taking
them
nowhere
at
such
times
she
felt
an
all
but
desire
to
scream
for
her
overwrought
imagination
was
telling
her
that
the
motors
would
roar
on
until
the
fuel
was
gone
then
they
would
crash
into
the
sea
at
times
she
felt
drowsy
at
others
she
was
so
wide
awake
that
she
wanted
to
leave
her
seat
for
a
walk
this
she
knew
was
not
entirely
impossible
since
a
bottle
of
oxygen
attached
to
her
tube
and
slung
over
her
shoulder
would
give
her
freedom
of
movement
but
this
would
call
for
more
exertion
than
she
felt
like
and
she
lapsed
back
into
sleepiness
then
little
by
little
she
found
herself
drifting
into
a
light
and
hilarious
mood
she
wanted
to
sing
she
did
hum
little
snatches
of
funny
songs
she
knew
the
bear
went
over
the
mountain
the
old
gray
mare
she
ain
t
what
she
used
to
be
and
from
time
to
time
sparky
looked
at
her
and
growled
into
his
mask
oh
sparky
she
cried
at
last
i
m
tired
of
this
mask
can
t
i
take
it
off
she
meant
this
only
as
a
joke
but
sparky
roared
for
heaven
s
sake
no
you
wouldn
t
last
half
a
nothing
daunted
she
told
him
a
rather
long
funny
story
is
that
supposed
to
be
a
joke
he
growled
if
so
where
s
the
point
she
began
to
realize
that
something
was
wrong
either
sparky
has
turned
into
a
terrible
crab
or
i
m
plain
crazy
she
told
herself
half
in
despair
from
hilarity
she
went
into
gloomy
foreboding
then
of
a
sudden
she
sprang
out
of
both
she
knew
what
had
happened
both
she
and
sparky
were
drunk
on
oxygen
they
had
been
up
high
too
long
they
should
drop
to
lower
levels
at
once
but
how
was
she
ever
to
make
sparky
see
this
in
the
morose
mood
of
a
partially
intoxicated
man
he
would
perhaps
resist
all
her
suggestions
after
a
moment
s
thought
she
believed
she
had
the
very
idea
sparky
she
said
i
m
suck
your
thumb
like
a
bear
he
growled
the
coffee
s
hot
a
whole
gallon
of
it
s
frozen
solid
i
told
you
it
would
be
know
what
the
temperature
outside
is
yes
i
know
but
that
coffee
s
still
how
come
that
s
my
then
keep
i
ll
bet
you
five
dollars
it
s
hot
yes
and
the
bottle
of
soup
you
got
five
dollars
sure
i
right
it
s
a
sure
it
is
do
come
on
down
to
five
thousand
feet
and
i
ll
show
okay
here
we
go
but
i
get
the
they
started
down
anxiously
mary
watched
the
recording
gage
twenty
thousand
fifteen
thousand
ten
opened
a
ventilator
then
another
at
five
thousand
they
leveled
off
when
at
last
the
air
was
changed
they
dragged
off
their
masks
whew
sparky
breathed
deeply
that
s
great
you
don
t
know
half
of
it
said
mary
where
s
your
hot
coffee
i
ll
get
she
did
when
the
cork
was
removed
steam
rose
from
the
bottle
well
i
ll
be
sparky
exclaimed
you
win
how
do
you
do
it
little
electric
heat
that
s
she
pointed
at
the
connections
at
the
base
of
the
thermos
bottle
say
sparky
beamed
from
now
on
you
and
i
travel
at
least
for
some
little
time
she
agreed
with
a
wise
smile
it
was
a
grand
little
lunch
they
enjoyed
there
above
the
black
waters
of
the
atlantic
mary
flew
the
ship
while
sparky
drank
hot
coffee
and
soup
and
munched
hot
cheese
sandwiches
then
he
took
the
controls
while
she
carried
on
with
the
lunch
box
but
when
it
was
all
over
and
they
began
once
more
to
climb
weighty
problems
once
more
bore
down
upon
mary
s
tired
brain
would
they
again
climb
high
and
fly
too
far
then
become
again
she
hated
to
ask
sparky
and
thousands
of
weary
miles
lay
ahead
miles
where
danger
lurked
all
the
way
then
too
there
was
their
precious
cargo
would
it
reach
its
destination
safely
it
must
she
whispered
she
reached
for
her
mask
and
then
sparky
spoke
chapter
v
the
lady
in
black
forget
the
mask
sparky
was
saying
we
ve
got
loads
of
gas
dawn
will
soon
be
here
we
ll
stay
five
thousand
feet
go
back
and
get
a
little
reluctantly
she
obeyed
having
wrapped
herself
in
the
eiderdown
robe
she
fell
fast
asleep
but
not
for
long
she
awoke
with
a
start
from
a
disturbing
dream
to
find
an
eerie
light
shining
down
upon
her
the
ship
s
on
fire
she
thought
tumbling
out
of
her
robe
she
sprang
to
a
window
to
whisper
we
have
met
the
it
was
true
the
sun
a
red
disk
rolled
along
the
horizon
the
sea
and
the
sky
were
all
ablaze
with
light
sparky
she
exclaimed
it
s
wonderful
is
it
he
asked
sleepily
just
another
sunrise
that
s
all
it
seems
to
be
but
look
mary
you
ve
been
a
peach
i
suppose
i
should
apologize
for
being
gruff
with
you
back
there
when
we
were
way
up
oh
no
mary
exclaimed
don
t
ever
apologize
your
friends
don
t
demand
it
your
enemies
don
t
deserve
it
besides
i
never
quarrel
with
people
when
they
re
a
teasing
smile
played
about
the
corners
of
her
mouth
who
s
been
drunk
he
shot
her
a
quick
look
you
think
i
m
crazy
i
m
not
a
drinking
man
but
if
i
were
i
d
be
plain
mad
if
i
drank
before
a
trip
like
oh
so
you
weren
t
drunk
she
threw
back
her
head
for
a
good
laugh
you
were
all
the
what
sparky
seemed
ready
to
leave
the
controls
to
crown
her
yes
you
were
drunk
and
so
was
i
was
happy
and
you
were
sad
that
s
how
people
get
when
they
are
say
are
you
crazy
no
sparky
i
m
she
laughed
again
we
were
having
an
oxygen
drunk
it
might
have
been
dangerous
i
realized
the
danger
just
in
time
too
much
oxygen
too
long
that
s
too
much
oxygen
too
long
he
repeated
after
her
i
ve
heard
of
that
happening
but
just
think
of
an
oldtimer
like
me
getting
caught
with
it
the
bigger
they
are
the
harder
they
she
favored
him
with
a
good
laugh
but
it
s
not
really
strange
she
added
soberly
our
trip
this
far
has
been
a
hard
one
you
ve
worked
long
hours
you
were
too
tired
to
think
i
was
fresh
that
made
all
the
difference
and
just
for
that
how
would
you
like
to
crawl
back
for
a
few
winks
don
t
mind
if
i
he
offered
her
the
controls
but
promise
me
that
if
anything
unusual
occurs
seaplanes
show
up
or
anything
like
that
you
ll
call
i
ll
call
you
she
agreed
sparky
s
sleep
was
long
and
peaceful
never
had
mary
enjoyed
herself
half
so
much
as
on
that
morning
guiding
the
big
ship
through
the
blue
sky
over
a
sea
as
dark
and
mysterious
as
death
an
hour
passed
two
three
hours
sometimes
she
wondered
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
about
their
secret
cargo
would
it
go
through
safely
and
would
she
be
with
the
ship
to
its
journey
s
end
just
then
none
of
these
things
appeared
to
matter
much
it
was
good
to
live
that
for
the
moment
was
enough
there
was
a
warmth
in
the
air
and
a
faint
fragrance
as
of
flowers
they
were
going
against
a
mild
breeze
once
she
spotted
dark
dots
on
the
ocean
far
below
there
were
a
convoy
it
must
she
told
herself
be
an
american
convoy
she
wanted
terribly
to
drop
down
low
and
dip
a
wing
in
salute
but
this
she
knew
would
never
do
some
enemy
sub
might
see
that
dip
and
know
that
the
convoy
lay
beneath
her
they
would
close
in
and
would
never
do
so
she
drove
straight
on
toward
the
rising
sun
at
last
a
long
low
cloud
appeared
on
the
horizon
before
her
or
was
it
a
cloud
breathing
softly
she
waited
and
watched
the
long
narrow
line
widened
it
seemed
to
take
form
some
spots
were
higher
some
strips
greener
than
others
at
last
she
whispered
excitedly
it
s
land
land
africa
i
ll
soon
be
abroad
the
long
hop
is
nearing
its
she
wanted
to
shout
for
joy
to
scream
but
this
she
knew
was
not
expected
of
the
of
a
big
ship
so
all
she
said
was
sparky
sparky
wake
up
we
re
nearing
land
and
i
don
t
know
the
way
to
that
secret
sparky
groaned
sleepily
it
can
t
be
land
i
just
stretched
out
here
a
minute
yes
i
mary
laughed
for
sheer
joy
it
s
land
all
the
same
i
think
i
see
a
camel
come
and
sparky
came
forward
rubbing
his
eyes
adjusting
his
glasses
he
took

and
they

whisked
away
to
a
small
city
of
low
white
buildings
gleaming
streets
and
many
camels
my
mary
exclaimed
it
s
hot

said
sparky

is
the
scene

so
fast
i
can
t
keep
up
mary
said
fanning
herself
it
won
t
be
bad
in
here
said
sparky
motioning
her
to
enter
a
long
low
eating
place
it
s
more
than
half
american
patronized
mostly
by
our
people
they
run
a
sort
of
concession
and
get
real
food
supplies
from
the
place
was
all
open
screened
windows
there
was
a
breeze
from
the
sea
the
food
was
good
even
to
the
coffee
just
think
of
taking
off
in
two
hours
mary
exclaimed
i
d
like
to
make
it
two
sure
sparky
grinned
great
place
for
a
gal
hundred
american
soldiers
to
pick
sparky
forget
it
she
was
half
inclined
to
be
angry
what
i
mean
is
i
d
like
really
to
see
these
places
we
visit
not
go
to
it
seems
such
a
that
s
right
sparky
agreed
after
the
war
we
ll
do
it
all
a
whole
year
for
will
we
she
asked
who
knows
he
spoke
slowly
we
may
be
dead
this
is
sparky
hurried
through
the
meal
then
excused
himself
got
ta
see
about
our
papers
he
explained
be
back
in
half
an
hour
get
yourself
another
cup
of
java
and
wait
here
in
the
hardly
had
sparky
disappeared
when
a
tall
young
woman
entered
she
was
dressed
in
a
striking
manner
all
in
black
yet
it
was
not
the
black
of
mourning
for
she
wore
much
bright
costume
jewelry
the
place
was
fairly
empty
a
native
couple
in
one
corner
and
two
doughboys
in
another
do
you
mind
the
woman
indicated
the
chair
sparky
had
left
one
sees
so
few
women
mary
did
not
mind
the
woman
who
spoke
with
a
french
accent
took
a
seat
then
ordered
cakes
and
sour
wine
you
are
from
america
the
woman
suggested
mary
nodded
a
lady
soldier
mary
shook
her
head
but
your
uniform
in
america
many
women
wear
uniforms
we
like
mary
smiled
i
happen
to
be
a
member
of
the
ferry
and
you
flew
a
big
plane
all
the
way
how
wonderful
shall
there
be
many
more
of
you
mary
broke
off
she
had
been
about
to
say
i
may
be
the
only
one
mine
is
a
special
what
a
fool
i
am
she
thought
i
came
for
the
ride
really
she
said
covering
up
deftly
my
father
is
over
here
ah
you
brave
americans
the
woman
exclaimed
they
saved
my
country
france
in
the
last
war
and
now
you
expect
us
to
do
it
again
mary
wanted
to
say
and
over
here
you
are
divided
you
don
t
really
know
what
you
she
did
not
say
this
nor
did
the
woman
finish
for
at
that
moment
a
young
woman
in
khaki
entered
the
place
and
walked
straight
to
their
table
to
ask
are
you
mary
mason
mary
stood
up
i
ve
been
asked
to
speak
to
that
is
i
have
a
message
for
the
girl
seemed
embarrassed
no
no
the
french
woman
was
on
her
feet
i
have
urgent
business
i
was
about
to
go
it
is
good
to
have
seen
she
bowed
to
mary
and
was
gone
will
you
forgive
the
girl
in
khaki
dropped
into
a
seat
i
just
had
to
do
it
i
never
saw
that
woman
before
she
may
be
all
right
you
never
know
over
here
half
the
people
are
for
us
the
other
half
against
you
dare
trust
no
one
you

she
hesitated
i
didn
t
tell
her
a
thing
worth
mary
smiled
will
you
have
a
cup
of
coffee
oh
sure
the
other
girl
s
face
beamed
real
american
girls
are
so
rare
you
are
a
wac
mary
suggested
yes
of
course
there
are
very
few
of
us
here
now
but
there
will
be
more
and
her
voice
dropped
that
s
the
sort
of
things
they
want
to
know
she
confided
in
a
whisper
they
talked
sipped
coffee
and
munched
cakes
until
sparky
hurried
into
the
place
all
set
he
exclaimed
our
outfit
is
still
far
ahead
of
us
got
to
get
after
mary
had
introduced
lucy
merriman
the
wac
they
were
on
their
way
i
ll
be
seeing
you
mary
called
back
then
she
added
in
an
undertone
i
as
she
climbed
into
the
car
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
tall
french
woman
she
was
talking
to
a
small
man
with
a
round
face
that
s
a
pair
said
sparky
lady
of
quality
and
a
beggar
he
looks
like
a
jap
mary
gave
the
fellow
a
sharp
look
she
would
know
him
if
she
saw
him
again
besides
she
added
he
can
t
be
quite
a
beggar
he
s
got
a
you
meet
all
types
here
sparky
replied
absently
it
s
the
strangest
country
you
ever
may
hope
to
see
we
ve
sure
got
to
watch
our
step
by
rights
we
should
fly
square
across
the
desert
but
with
our
cargo
his
voice
dropped
it
s
too
so
we
ll
go
northeast
mary
suggested
that
s
that
takes
us
into
fighting
country
the
car
started
returning
them
to
the
airfield
there
s
a
secret
airport
on
an
oasis
sparky
told
mary
that
ll
be
our
first
stop
after
that
we
hit
egypt
and
another
secret
spot
egypt
is
safe
enough
it
s
those
miles
in
his
brow
wrinkled
in
a
frown
but
we
ll
make
chapter
vi
mysterious
moslem
to
mary
the
next
lap
in
their
long
journey
will
always
remain
a
blank
but
the
oasis
at
which
they
arrived
will
stand
out
vividly
in
her
memory
the
reason
for
the
blank
was
quite
simple
for
as
soon
as
they
were
safely
in
the
air
sparky
said
mary
you
look
tired
i
know
you
are
tough
as
a
hickory
limb
and
you
ve
got
all
kinds
of
oh
thanks
sparky
she
grinned
i
m
glad
you
ve
got
my
got
your
number
sparky
exploded
of
course
i
have
and
just
now
you
need
sleep
that
secret
cargo
of
ours
won
t
wait
and
sparky
tell
me
what
our
secret
cargo
is
she
begged
will
you
stop
interrupting
me
he
stormed
how
do
i
know
what
it
is
that
s
a
military
secret
all
i
know
is
that
china
needs
all
the
help
we
can
bring
her
every
bit
and
that
this
cargo
of
ours
is
of
the
greatest
importance
i
shouldn
t
wonder
his
voice
dropped
as
if
he
were
afraid
someone
were
listening
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
the
enemy
knows
it
s
important
i
got
a
warning
to
be
on
my
guard
not
an
hour
ago
and
that
goes
for
you
as
well
this
is
a
dangerous
land
it
s
all
full
of
italians
wild
natives
and
even
a
few
traitorous
frenchmen
that
would
sell
us
out
for
a
dime
or
kill
us
just
for
fun
and
he
paused
for
breath
and
mary
prompted
let
s
see
where
was
i
sparky
pulled
back
the
stick
to
climb
a
bit
oh
yes
and
so
we
ve
just
got
to
keep
right
on
flying
mighty
little
time
for
sleep
i
had
a
dandy
rest
before
we
hit
africa
now
it
s
your
turn
i
ll
do
this
lap
you
just
crawl
back
there
roll
up
in
your
robe
and
all
too
willingly
mary
rolled
up
in
her
robe
and
slept
when
she
awoke
they
were
circling
for
a
landing
at
one
of
the
most
fascinating
spots
she
had
ever
known
looking
down
upon
it
as
they
were
from
ten
thousand
feet
it
seemed
a
green
carpet
on
an
endless
gray
floor
an
oasis
mary
whispered
how
beautiful
yes
and
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
those
dark
moving
spots
over
there
on
the
grasslands
were
giraffes
or
maybe
yes
and
there
s
a
camel
caravan
just
coming
in
mary
exclaimed
how
long
it
is
must
be
fifty
camels
and
the
shadows
seem
darker
than
the
camels
oh
i
wish
we
could
stay
a
week
well
we
can
t
sparky
warned
few
hours
at
best
our
right
engine
isn
t
acting
properly
has
to
be
tuned
up
for
this
desert
air
i
guess
that
ll
give
you
a
breathing
spell
make
the
most
of
the
camel
shadows
on
the
desert
were
long
the
sun
was
almost
down
when
at
last
their
plane
came
to
rest
on
that
long
narrow
runway
there
in
the
desert
here
again
they
found
good
american
soldiers
and
mechanics
and
mary
once
more
found
herself
creating
a
sensation
hey
fellas
one
boy
with
bulging
eyes
shouted
it
s
a
lady
a
lady
pilot
right
out
here
just
a
mile
beyond
nowhere
joe
hey
jerry
you
tom
another
called
come
and
see
it
we
got
lions
an
elephants
zebras
giraffes
and
aardvarks
but
this
one
is
different
come
see
if
you
can
name
he
looked
at
mary
and
laughed
happily
they
were
grand
boys
all
of
them
and
those
who
were
not
on
duty
showed
her
the
time
of
her
life
they
hurried
her
off
to
mess
where
they
feasted
her
on
ripe
figs
bananas
strawberries
and
all
manner
of
african
delicacies
then
one
of
them
said
come
on
we
ll
show
you
something
you
ll
never
how
long
will
it
take
she
demurred
only
an
hour
or
i
ll
have
to
ask
sparky
about
illustration
found
herself
creating
a
she
found
sparky
perspiring
and
covered
with
grease
as
he
worked
with
the
mechanics
tuning
up
the
engine
two
hours
was
his
short
reply
be
back
in
two
hours
if
you
want
to
fly
with
we
ll
be
back
in
an
hour
a
boy
from
indiana
exclaimed
sure
sure
they
all
agreed
come
on
what
are
we
waiting
for
let
s
and
so
away
they
all
marched
to
the
shelter
where
the
jeeps
were
kept
it
was
while
on
this
march
that
mary
received
a
sudden
shock
as
they
hurried
along
they
met
a
woman
dressed
as
a
moslem
woman
always
is
she
wore
a
long
flowing
robe
and
her
face
save
for
her
eyes
was
covered
with
a
veil
yet
there
seemed
to
be
something
very
familiar
about
the
tall
erect
figure
and
the
brisk
springing
walk
jeepers
i
never
saw
her
before
a
boy
whispered
at
the
same
time
mary
was
thinking
i
must
have
seen
her
somewhere
but
how
could
just
then
the
dark
eyes
shining
out
from
behind
the
veil
gave
her
a
sharp
penetrating
look
in
her
shock
mary
stumbled
and
nearly
fell
can
she
be
the
woman
who
asked
me
questions
in
that
eating
place
way
back
there
in
the
little
city
by
the
sea
she
asked
herself
and
then
how
could
it
be
oh
she
exclaimed
stopping
short
i
can
t
go
with
you
boys
i
must
not
aw
come
on
a
boy
from
texas
begged
you
ll
never
see
a
thing
like
it
we
won
t
be
gone
an
sure
sure
you
must
come
they
were
such
nice
boys
and
she
knew
so
well
what
it
must
mean
to
be
escorting
a
real
american
girl
in
such
a
place
that
she
yielded
and
came
along
and
yet
i
shouldn
t
do
it
she
told
herself
before
they
were
gone
she
received
a
second
shock
just
as
they
were
all
piling
into
the
car
a
small
man
and
a
camel
came
shambling
down
the
road
can
he
be
the
little
man
i
saw
at
the
port
she
asked
herself
it
gave
her
a
shock
to
think
that
this
little
man
and
the
woman
in
black
had
somehow
made
their
way
here
before
them
this
thought
as
far
as
the
little
man
was
concerned
was
when
he
had
come
closer
she
saw
that
he
was
shorter
than
the
other
man
that
his
face
was
rounder
and
there
was
a
scar
across
his
left
cheek
she
heaved
a
sigh
on
making
this
discovery
but
her
relief
was
not
to
be
of
long
duration
and
so
they
rattled
away
nine
boys
and
a
lady
the
first
they
had
seen
in
many
a
day
i
shouldn
t
have
come
mary
whispered
to
herself
once
again
had
she
but
known
it
she
was
to
be
thinking
that
very
thought
hours
later
and
with
regrets
darkness
had
come
switching
on
the
lights
they
went
bumping
over
the
sand
ridges
rides
just
like
that
big
ship
of
yours
doesn
t
it
said
the
boy
from
kentucky
exactly
said
mary
giggling
like
a
kid
she
was
happy
but
some
sprite
seemed
to
whisper
not
for
after
rattling
along
for
a
while
with
the
lights
on
they
snapped
the
lights
off
but
rattled
straight
on
a
dark
bulk
loomed
up
before
them
shutting
off
the
gas
they
all
but
the
driver
piled
out
and
began
to
push
such
crazy
business
mary
whispered
wait
and
see
came
back
to
her
at
last
they
came
to
a
halt
the
dark
bulk
was
closer
now
mary
made
out
the
forms
of
palm
trees
one
of
the
boys
was
dragging
something
strange
sounds
came
from
before
them
low
grunts
splashes
then
a
loud
sound
that
made
mary
jump
say
what
is
this
she
whispered
someone
snapped
on
a
spot
light
connected
by
a
wire
to
the
car
then
she
knew
for
there
before
her
like
a
set
in
a
museum
was
a
water
hole
and
in
the
water
stood
all
manner
of
creatures
ugly
rhinoceros
graceful
gazelles
ungainly
giraffes
huge
elephants
and
who
could
say
what
else
are
they
really
alive
she
asked
in
an
awed
whisper
sure
what
do
you
think
the
boy
at
her
side
laughed
we
got
em
trained
now
you
should
have
seen
em
the
first
time
yes
an
heard
em
another
laughed
low
they
spilled
all
the
water
getting
it
s
about
all
the
fun
we
have
way
out
here
one
boy
added
with
a
touch
of
sorrow
oh
gee
why
don
t
you
stay
with
us
i
d
love
to
said
mary
but
i
ve
got
a
job
to
do
there
s
a
war
on
you
and
don
t
we
know
it
the
boy
whispered
one
night
we
were
bombed
two
boys
were
killed
and
three
went
to
the
hospital
gee
just
think
of
dying
way
out
here
mary
was
thinking
by
and
by
she
whispered
we
d
better
go
without
a
word
they
turned
about
to
go
shuffling
back
to
the
car
thanks
a
lot
for
coming
with
us
one
of
the
boys
shouted
when
they
unloaded
at
the
airport
sure
sure
they
shouted
hope
you
come
this
way
again
i
ll
be
seeing
you
she
called
then
with
a
lump
in
her
throat
she
walked
to
the
plane
where
the
men
were
just
replacing
the
motor
did
she
see
a
shadow
dart
away
from
the
other
wing
of
the
plane
it
was
too
dark
really
to
know
probably
a
sneaking
old
jackal
she
told
herself
sparky
she
said
as
they
soared
aloft
some
time
later
i
m
going
to
resign
from
this
job
of
and
then
what
sparky
asked
in
surprise
then
i
m
going
from
place
to
place
in
all
these
lonely
spots
cheering
up
the
that
said
sparky
would
be
a
noble
purpose
but
just
now
you
re
bound
to
this
big
plane
and
me
and
you
ll
not
leave
us
for
a
long
time
not
till
the
journey
s
not
till
the
journey
s
end
she
repeated
softly
and
how
soon
would
the
end
come
who
could
tell
perhaps
tonight
one
never
knew
she
shuddered
a
little
then
turned
her
attention
to
the
work
of
the
hour
that
night
mary
did
not
sleep
sparky
had
first
call
on
a
time
for
rest
and
he
surely
needed
it
he
told
her
to
call
him
in
two
hours
but
i
won
t
she
told
herself
not
if
all
goes
well
something
tells
me
i
won
t
sleep
if
i
have
the
she
found
herself
haunted
by
a
sense
of
impending
doom
the
tall
french
woman
all
in
black
and
the
stately
moslem
lady
were
constantly
being
blended
on
the
pictured
walls
of
her
mind
and
after
that
with
the
slow
sleepy
tread
of
the
desert
came
the
two
little
men
and
their
camels
they
too
seemed
part
of
the
same
picture
but
just
how
she
could
not
tell
what
foolishness
she
whispered
lie
down
you
but
they
would
not
they
continued
to
haunt
her
she
gave
herself
over
to
glimpses
of
the
desert
and
the
night
there
was
a
glorious
moon
the
desert
beneath
her
was
full
of
haunting
shadows
for
the
most
part
they
were
shadows
of
sandy
hills
but
at
times
they
loomed
dark
and
large
oases
she
told
herself
wonder
if
friend
or
foe
live
sparky
had
told
her
that
this
night
they
were
to
fly
over
dangerous
country
little
pockets
of
enemy
resistance
here
had
not
been
crushed
she
was
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
and
if
she
sighted
a
plane
was
to
call
him
at
once
we
can
outclimb
and
outfly
most
enemy
fighters
he
had
said
but
we
must
not
let
them
get
the
drop
on
so
with
eyes
and
ears
alert
she
rode
on
through
the
night
all
went
well
she
called
sparky
in
three
hours
he
scolded
her
for
waiting
so
long
it
was
the
spell
of
the
desert
at
night
she
told
him
seems
as
if
i
could
fly
on
and
on
forever
and
just
think
we
may
never
pass
this
way
again
life
is
like
that
so
why
bother
was
the
reply
she
went
back
for
her
turn
at
resting
but
did
not
sleep
was
it
the
spell
of
the
desert
night
that
kept
her
awake
who
can
say
at
least
she
did
not
sleep
just
lay
there
wrapped
in
her
robe
staring
into
the
darkness
listening
to
the
roar
of
the
motors
and
thinking
thinking
her
father
was
somewhere
in
africa
she
knew
that
and
no
more
it
would
seem
strange
to
pass
over
him
in
the
night
and
not
to
see
him
at
all
yet
that
might
happen
there
was
no
time
for
looking
around
no
time
for
anything
they
must
go
on
and
on
when
two
hours
had
passed
she
was
back
at
sparky
s
side
asking
for
the
controls
i
can
t
sleep
she
explained
flying
over
the
desert
is
fascinating
you
don
t
care
a
whoop
about
that
s
then
why
not
let
me
have
a
chance
at
it
sure
why
not
he
yielded
the
controls
as
she
took
over
the
words
of
an
old
song
were
running
through
her
mind
dance
gypsies
sing
gypsies
dance
while
you
it
is
in
time
of
war
that
such
simple
songs
as
this
take
on
a
world
of
meaning
she
had
not
been
at
the
controls
an
hour
when
the
first
faint
traces
of
dawn
began
to
appear
then
suddenly
a
signal
on
her
board
flashed
a
grim
warning
instantly
her
fingers
shut
off
the
fuel
and
oil
from
their
left
motor
the
next
instant
she
turned
the
snow
on
that
motor
as
she
called
sparky
sparky
quick
our
left
motor
is
on
fire
sparky
was
at
her
side
in
an
instant
chapter
vii
battling
at
close
quarters
let
me
see
sparky
s
eyes
flashed
over
the
instrument
board
fuel
and
oil
off
extinguisher
on
good
girl
he
patted
her
shoulder
you
know
what
to
i
know
more
than
her
lips
were
in
a
straight
line
what
s
that
i
should
have
stayed
with
the
ship
last
i
don
t
see
someone
tampered
with
our
left
motor
while
you
were
busy
with
the
other
not
necessarily
motors
have
caught
fire
many
times
without
tampering
your
motor
is
set
on
springs
that
s
to
prevent
vibration
because
of
this
your
fuel
and
oil
must
come
through
flexible
yes
i
know
all
that
she
broke
in
sometimes
the
connection
gets
loose
gas
drips
on
the
manifold
and
then
there
is
a
fire
all
the
you
think
our
motor
was
tampered
with
well
i
don
t
anyway
all
we
can
do
is
to
watch
everything
fly
on
one
and
hope
for
the
and
you
said
this
was
dangerous
very
dawn
is
the
most
dangerous
of
all
if
an
enemy
fighter
spots
us
he
s
sure
to
come
after
and
she
was
feeling
a
little
dizzy
then
we
ll
have
to
try
to
defend
ourselves
mind
if
i
leave
you
for
a
moment
ll
carry
we
ve
got
a
couple
of
free
machine
guns
i
ll
have
them
ready
just
in
must
we
fight
it
s
all
there
is
left
to
do
we
can
t
climb
on
one
motor
all
we
can
do
is
to
stay
up
a
mile
and
go
straight
oh
perhaps
a
fight
mary
thought
as
he
went
back
in
the
cabin
the
gray
sands
were
turning
white
before
the
rising
sun
she
saw
a
speck
in
the
distance
could
it
be
an
enemy
plane
she
wished
sparky
would
come
back
supposing
the
fire
broke
out
of
the
motor
enclosure
and
the
ship
burned
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
course
she
reassured
herself
we
d
take
to
our
parachutes
and
but
escape
to
what
a
voice
seemed
to
whisper
to
sifting
sands
that
was
the
answer
and
then
there
was
their
precious
cargo
here
was
sparky
again
all
his
voice
was
almost
cheerful
spoiling
for
a
fight
mary
teased
i
wouldn
t
mind
knocking
down
one
or
two
of
hitler
s
desert
rats
was
the
quick
reply
there
s
fighting
blood
in
my
family
grandfather
in
the
civil
war
and
dad
all
the
way
with
the
canadians
in
the
other
world
war
and
here
i
am
just
flying
flying
flying
flying
gets
a
bit
dull
at
times
except
he
hastened
to
add
when
you
have
an
attractive
he
was
talking
she
knew
just
to
quiet
her
nerves
there
s
worse
to
come
she
told
herself
and
she
was
not
mistaken
the
fire
must
be
about
out
by
now
he
said
a
moment
later
there
are
a
lot
of
sprays
shooting
snow
at
that
engine
it
s
under
pounds
of
pressure
turn
off
the
extinguisher
and
i
ll
work
my
way
back
there
through
the
she
snapped
off
the
extinguisher
can
you
do
anything
about
it
oh
sure
there
was
a
forced
cheerfulness
in
his
voice
i
can
get
to
that
engine
i
ll
take
tools
and
a
new
tube
i
ll
fix
it
wait
and
see
sparky
she
gripped
his
arm
be
careful
i
wouldn
t
you
know
that
desert
looks
awfully
i
ll
be
once
again
he
was
gone
leaving
her
to
the
ship
s
controls
the
desert
and
the
spreading
dawn
she
could
see
a
long
way
now
there
really
was
an
airplane
out
there
on
the
horizon
but
then
there
were
planes
everywhere
these
days
this
plane
acted
strangely
it
seemed
at
first
to
be
coming
straight
toward
her
then
it
took
a
broad
sweep
and
began
to
disappear
like
some
old
marauding
crow
going
back
to
tell
his
friends
she
thought
hope
sparky
won
t
be
long
but
then
of
course
in
that
cramped
place
he
can
t
work
fast
just
have
to
be
patient
that
s
the
truth
is
that
sparky
had
not
even
started
repairing
the
engine
there
were
he
had
discovered
other
matters
that
needed
attending
to
first
all
the
time
mary
was
watching
the
sky
the
plane
out
there
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
had
reappeared
a
mere
speck
against
the
blue
it
increased
in
size
even
at
that
great
distance
she
somehow
believed
this
was
a
different
plane
presently
this
plane
too
cut
a
broad
circle
then
began
to
fade
like
bees
coming
out
from
a
hive
she
thought
afraid
of
us
perhaps
our
big
fighting
planes
have
been
knocking
them
down
of
if
that
were
true
she
hoped
they
would
keep
on
being
afraid
as
sparky
crept
on
hands
and
knees
through
the
low
wing
section
of
the
plane
toward
this
disabled
engine
he
had
caught
a
disturbing
sound
like
the
hiss
of
a
goose
he
thought
he
flashed
a
light
before
him
then
recoiled
as
if
struck
a
blow
little
wonder
for
there
not
ten
feet
before
him
was
a
pair
of
bulging
eyes
beneath
the
eyes
was
a
mouth
with
a
tongue
moving
up
and
down
like
a
snake
he
thought
he
was
not
deceived
it
was
not
a
snake
but
of
all
persons
a
jap
our
engine
tampered
with
his
head
spun
but
his
temper
rose
to
a
white
heat
between
him
and
the
jap
was
a
leading
to
the
desert
below
providing
you
had
a
parachute
and
the
jap
had
one
strapped
to
his
back
ready
to
go
sparky
told
himself
he
would
have
gone
before
this
but
he
was
afraid
now
he
will
never
as
if
reading
his
thoughts
the
jap
sprang
forward
he
was
too
late
sparky
was
solidly
settled
on
the
door
hissing
like
a
snake
the
little
man
snatched
a
knife
from
his
belt
one
moment
it
hung
in
air
the
next
it
rattled
against
the
wing
s
floor
a
heavy
wrench
had
crushed
against
the
jap
s
arm
all
but
breaking
it
illustration
him
and
the
jap
was
a
then
they
came
to
grips
it
was
muscle
and
brawn
against
and
all
manner
of
oriental
tricks
now
an
arm
like
the
tail
of
a
was
about
sparky
s
neck
choking
choking
him
to
death
and
now
sparky
s
fingers
were
gripping
the
jap
s
arm
twisting
it
until
bones
cracked
it
was
a
battle
now
the
jap
was
clawing
at
sparky
s
eyes
and
now
sparky
had
those
claws
between
his
teeth
it
became
a
struggle
for
weapons
once
the
jap
gripped
the
handle
of
his
knife
only
to
receive
a
blow
in
the
face
from
sparky
s
fist
that
sent
him
reeling
regaining
possession
of
his
wrench
sparky
aimed
a
blow
at
the
head
of
that
serpent
of
the
rising
sun
only
a
sudden
upward
thrust
of
a
foot
saved
the
jap
i
ll
kill
you
the
jap
hissed
in
good
english
come
on
then
try
it
sparky
aimed
one
more
blow
at
the
jap
s
face
the
jap
dodged
sparky
lost
his
balance
and
fell
flat
for
a
space
of
seconds
he
was
at
the
enemy
s
mercy
but
to
get
the
knife
the
jap
must
crawl
over
sparky
s
body
he
tried
just
that
and
this
was
his
undoing
for
with
a
mighty
heave
sparky
pinned
him
flat
and
against
the
hard
slats
above
him
rising
to
hands
and
knees
sparky
put
all
the
power
of
his
splendid
muscles
into
the
task
of
crushing
the
last
gasp
from
the
now
thoroughly
beaten
enemy
when
the
last
gasp
came
he
slid
from
beneath
the
jap
to
let
him
down
with
a
dull
thud
you
wanted
to
go
down
sparky
panted
now
s
your
his
hands
were
on
the
s
fastening
the
jap
lay
on
that
door
then
he
paused
to
reflect
it
would
be
the
end
he
knew
well
enough
the
jap
was
not
dead
but
helpless
his
parachute
had
been
torn
from
his
back
you
ve
got
it
coming
sparky
grumbled
you
planned
all
this
it
would
have
been
our
end
not
yours
but
his
fingers
trembled
he
undid
a
catch
then
he
fastened
it
again
he
was
thinking
of
the
empty
desert
and
the
jackals
it
s
too
good
for
you
he
grumbled
but
i
can
t
do
at
that
he
bound
the
jap
who
by
this
time
was
stirring
and
breathing
then
pushing
him
far
back
in
the
wing
he
tied
him
fast
tomorrow
he
said
aloud
they
will
shoot
you
at
firing
squad
you
the
jap
s
eyes
rolled
as
a
low
hiss
escaped
his
lips
after
that
sparky
went
about
the
business
of
repairing
the
disabled
engine
and
all
the
time
mary
at
the
controls
was
growing
more
and
more
uneasy
at
his
prolonged
absence
little
wonder
for
out
there
on
the
horizon
there
were
movements
like
that
about
a
beehive
when
the
bees
begin
to
swarm
they
were
a
long
way
off
but
an
threat
for
all
that
now
there
was
one
now
two
now
three
and
now
five
airplanes
like
a
small
flock
of
birds
they
flocked
toward
the
sky
then
all
went
swooping
down
again
rehearsing
for
trouble
she
breathed
i
wish
sparky
would
come
what
was
to
be
done
trouble
soared
in
the
distant
air
she
feared
the
worst
for
sparky
yet
had
no
means
of
communication
with
him
and
could
not
for
a
single
instant
leave
the
controls
despair
had
begun
to
grip
her
heart
when
there
came
a
series
of
bumps
behind
her
and
there
stood
sparky
sparky
she
exclaimed
you
look
terrible
there
s
blood
on
your
face
blood
soot
and
grease
what
happened
you
were
he
leaned
heavily
on
the
back
of
the
seat
there
was
a
man
back
there
a
little
rat
of
a
i
knew
it
i
saw
him
back
there
at
that
oasis
she
exclaimed
there
may
be
a
tall
woman
in
black
in
that
other
now
you
crazy
he
exclaimed
let
me
tell
she
told
of
the
tall
woman
in
black
and
the
arab
woman
that
looked
like
her
were
those
two
the
same
person
she
asked
we
ll
ask
the
he
managed
a
smile
then
you
didn
she
hesitated
no
i
didn
t
kill
him
he
answered
but
i
should
have
i
had
a
coil
of
insulated
wire
in
my
kit
i
bound
him
hand
and
foot
with
that
and
left
him
back
there
i
hope
he
likes
he
won
t
get
loose
never
try
that
engine
i
cobbled
it
up
take
it
she
eased
the
engine
into
motion
once
more
soon
both
engines
were
roaring
their
best
sparky
that
s
wonderful
now
we
re
safe
not
for
sure
that
motor
needs
a
going
over
he
broke
off
to
stare
at
the
northern
sky
planes
headed
this
way
a
whole
formation
of
them
say
this
is
being
done
according
to
plan
the
enemy
knows
of
our
secret
cargo
the
jap
was
to
cripple
us
those
planes
were
to
finish
us
off
well
they
won
t
get
out
your
oxygen
mask
girl
we
re
going
up
to
visit
the
stars
there
s
not
a
fighter
made
by
those
rats
that
can
beat
us
to
the
stratosphere
she
set
the
ship
climbing
then
reached
for
her
oxygen
mask
when
she
had
it
handy
she
set
herself
for
this
new
ordeal
but
sparky
she
cried
what
about
the
jap
well
what
about
him
he
growled
he
ll
die
let
him
die
then
yes
but
you
didn
t
finish
him
you
let
him
all
right
i
ll
take
him
a
mask
and
two
oxygen
bottles
it
s
a
waste
of
that
precious
stuff
but
there
s
the
rule
of
war
i
ll
be
he
vanished
and
on
the
instant
mary
wished
that
she
had
not
spoken
what
is
one
spy
more
or
less
she
asked
herself
now
i
m
here
to
face
it
alone
chapter
viii
desert
battles
oddly
enough
as
mary
set
the
big
plane
climbing
she
recalled
sparky
s
words
you
are
with
me
to
the
journey
s
was
this
to
be
the
journey
s
end
one
thing
was
sure
during
their
moments
of
excitement
over
the
captured
spy
they
had
allowed
the
enemy
to
come
dangerously
close
six
fighting
planes
were
coming
roaring
toward
them
at
top
speed
breathless
with
suspense
mary
watched
their
altitude
increase
ten
thousand
feet
eleven
twelve
fifteen
thousand
it
was
not
as
fast
as
this
instead
to
her
excited
mind
the
figures
appeared
to
creep
upward
like
a
man
with
a
crutch
going
upstairs
one
plane
was
ahead
of
the
others
he
ll
get
us
i
am
sure
of
that
she
groaned
oh
if
sparky
were
only
here
then
the
enemy
did
a
strange
thing
instead
of
coming
right
on
like
a
catbird
after
a
hawk
he
circled
wide
going
completely
around
the
big
plane
there
was
contempt
in
her
voice
he
d
better
be
it
was
sparky
who
spoke
he
was
standing
in
the
center
of
the
cabin
in
his
hands
he
gripped
a
heavy
machine
gun
as
the
enemy
circled
closer
he
opened
a
window
a
crack
to
send
forth
a
burst
of
fire
the
plane
veered
off
swinging
around
before
them
then
coming
up
on
the
other
side
sparky
had
donned
his
mask
so
too
had
mary
they
were
getting
into
thin
air
if
only
we
can
hold
them
off
mary
thought
once
again
sparky
s
gun
spoke
then
again
and
yet
again
like
a
cowardly
the
fighters
were
closing
in
slowly
there
were
three
of
them
now
there
came
the
of
machine
gun
fire
from
the
distance
no
bullets
found
their
mark
in
desperation
mary
set
her
motors
going
at
a
dangerous
rate
if
that
burned
motor
fails
me
her
heart
paused
then
raced
on
good
girl
sparky
encouraged
her
we
re
leaving
them
behind
they
can
t
go
much
farther
not
at
this
altitude
you
you
re
looking
white
around
the
lips
here
i
ll
take
the
she
staggered
from
her
place
leaned
for
a
space
of
seconds
then
looking
down
watched
the
fighter
planes
still
battling
their
way
upward
with
shaking
hands
she
reached
for
the
machine
gun
this
can
t
be
the
journey
s
end
she
murmured
and
then
something
strange
happened
the
foremost
plane
that
had
been
straining
to
reach
them
faltered
in
midair
seemed
to
hang
there
for
a
moment
then
dropping
one
wing
went
into
a
spiral
dive
that
increased
in
speed
until
it
seemed
a
boy
s
top
spinning
in
the
sky
dragging
her
eyes
from
this
fascinating
and
terrible
sight
she
looked
for
the
other
planes
they
too
were
going
down
but
under
control
they
had
given
up
the
task
assigned
to
them
s
all
over
finished
she
sank
down
in
her
place
beside
sparky
that
first
plane
she
said
after
a
time
it
went
down
in
a
spin
the
pilot
didn
t
bale
out
it
just
went
down
i
ve
done
a
lot
of
duck
hunting
in
my
day
sparky
replied
quietly
sometimes
i
d
shoot
at
a
flock
of
ducks
in
midair
they
d
sail
right
on
but
a
mile
away
one
of
them
would
drop
behind
go
into
a
spin
and
come
plunging
you
mean
your
bullets
reached
that
plane
mary
asked
they
might
have
then
again
the
fellow
may
have
climbed
too
something
on
his
plane
froze
up
yes
or
he
did
whichever
way
it
was
there
s
one
less
of
them
for
our
boys
over
here
to
take
care
of
we
won
a
bloodless
after
that
maintaining
their
altitude
they
flew
on
for
a
hundred
miles
in
silence
then
after
a
good
look
at
the
empty
sky
sparky
tilted
the
plane
s
nose
downward
soon
they
were
dragging
off
their
masks
and
drinking
in
the
crisp
desert
air
of
the
upper
reaches
have
to
get
back
and
see
how
my
prisoner
is
getting
yes
that
jap
she
took
the
controls
there
was
a
strange
look
on
his
face
when
he
returned
well
she
asked
i
didn
t
mean
to
tell
you
he
replied
soberly
you
asked
for
it
so
here
it
is
he
s
gone
to
join
his
you
seems
his
mask
didn
t
suit
him
so
he
knocked
it
oh
i
in
other
words
he
committed
in
a
rather
strange
way
i
gave
him
a
desert
burial
he
explained
after
a
while
just
opened
the
trap
door
to
the
wing
and
let
him
she
nodded
it
had
been
a
long
hard
journey
that
day
she
hoped
there
would
be
sunshine
laughter
and
song
at
that
day
s
journey
s
end
and
for
once
she
was
not
to
be
disappointed
a
short
time
later
something
big
loomed
up
before
them
on
the
horizon
is
it
a
mountain
mary
asked
herself
it
seemed
a
little
strange
that
it
should
be
there
then
too
it
was
so
perfect
in
form
no
bumps
on
this
side
or
that
recognize
it
sparky
asked
no
could
it
yes
that
s
exactly
what
it
is
he
laughed
a
pyramid
and
this
is
egypt
she
was
impressed
yup
better
get
out
your
lipstick
we
ll
be
landing
in
about
fifteen
minutes
i
ve
never
been
here
but
the
other
boys
say
it
s
quite
a
spot
not
so
far
from
you
need
scrubbing
up
more
than
i
do
and
a
bit
of
first
don
t
bother
about
she
did
for
all
that
with
a
damp
cloth
she
washed
the
blood
and
engine
grease
from
his
face
then
applied
antiseptic
after
that
she
gave
herself
a
hurried
and
then
there
they
were
circling
for
one
more
landing
among
the
date
palms
she
found
herself
a
trifle
shaky
about
the
knees
when
at
last
she
stepped
down
to
the
good
earth
a
few
steps
away
a
strongly
built
man
was
standing
talking
to
another
he
looks
familiar
she
told
herself
just
then
the
man
turned
dad
she
cried
after
three
long
strides
she
was
in
his
arms
mary
it
s
good
to
see
you
he
boomed
i
knew
you
were
coming
but
i
couldn
t
let
you
know
where
i
was
why
did
you
volunteer
for
so
dangerous
an
assignment
because
i
am
your
daughter
she
replied
proudly
you
wouldn
t
want
me
to
stand
back
now
would
you
no
mary
i
wouldn
t
you
ve
made
it
safely
this
far
here
s
wishing
you
luck
and
safety
to
the
journey
s
the
journey
s
end
she
thought
if
he
but
knew
how
close
we
came
to
that
end
this
very
mary
her
father
was
saying
i
want
you
to
meet
the
finest
american
flier
in
egypt
captain
burt
ramsey
captain
ramsey
this
is
my
charmed
to
meet
her
sir
was
the
quick
response
i
am
pleased
to
meet
she
gave
the
young
man
her
best
smile
and
why
not
he
stood
and
looked
every
inch
the
hair
brown
eyes
and
that
look
that
fliers
especially
over
the
desert
acquire
i
am
surprised
at
that
introduction
colonel
the
captain
grinned
broadly
from
all
you
ve
been
telling
me
this
young
lady
must
be
the
best
flier
in
oh
that
s
purely
a
family
matter
paternal
pride
said
the
colonel
illustration
captain
ramsey
this
is
my
daughter
mary
he
said
you
must
be
starved
dead
for
sleep
and
visibly
shaken
she
added
yes
all
of
that
and
more
you
d
never
believe
it
but
we
did
away
with
two
desert
rats
on
this
that
s
right
sparky
who
had
just
come
up
agreed
one
yellow
rat
and
one
that
was
a
doubtful
tell
us
ramsey
demanded
not
now
mary
pleaded
perhaps
not
i
just
wanted
to
say
sparky
broke
in
that
we
ll
be
here
until
three
tomorrow
morning
our
next
hop
is
a
long
one
and
that
burned
engine
needs
a
going
oh
hours
of
rest
mary
nearly
collapsed
in
her
father
s
arms
you
ll
never
know
what
that
i
ll
leave
you
now
burt
ramsey
saluted
shall
i
see
you
at
waltz
time
tonight
waltz
time
on
the
radio
mary
stared
no
indeed
waltz
time
on
a
very
good
floor
and
with
an
orchestra
that
lifts
its
hat
to
oh
she
breathed
that
will
be
too
just
the
change
you
need
her
father
encouraged
you
can
do
a
man
s
work
but
no
woman
can
be
a
man
all
the
all
right
then
it
s
a
she
put
out
a
hand
father
and
i
will
be
once
again
the
captain
saluted
then
turning
about
he
marched
away
after
taking
her
overnight
bag
from
the
plane
mary
climbed
into
a
big
car
beside
her
father
and
went
rolling
away
this
is
like
old
times
she
sighed
i
wish
you
were
staying
a
he
drew
a
long
breath
that
of
course
is
out
that
big
flight
of
bombers
went
through
here
our
yes
i
suppose
so
planes
and
they
were
burning
up
the
air
looks
as
if
something
big
were
in
the
making
over
the
air
of
or
that
s
what
everyone
is
hoping
but
no
one
really
did
you
see
our
flight
leader
she
asked
yes
indeed
they
took
on
gas
here
he
was
very
much
concerned
about
your
plane
his
voice
dropped
about
your
cargo
made
me
promise
you
fighter
protection
across
the
arabian
fighter
protection
could
have
used
some
you
ll
have
the
very
best
tomorrow
captain
ramsey
is
going
as
fighter
flight
commander
he
ll
have
three
men
with
oh
that
will
be
wonderful
she
enthused
even
if
we
don
t
run
into
well
here
we
are
this
is
where
i
he
brought
the
car
to
a
stop
before
a
beautiful
little
chateau
some
class
she
exclaimed
how
about
my
staying
on
as
your
cook
the
cooking
is
taken
care
of
i
ll
give
you
a
job
as
hostess
after
your
journey
s
nope
not
interested
i
m
in
for
the
good
he
took
her
bag
we
ll
find
you
a
cool
dark
room
to
sleep
in
and
call
you
in
time
for
dinner
how
s
that
nothing
could
be
she
was
awake
and
dressed
for
dinner
before
he
called
her
and
in
spite
of
the
ordeals
of
the
day
felt
quite
refreshed
and
ready
for
anything
here
s
a
party
dress
i
managed
to
pick
up
for
you
her
father
said
holding
out
a
creation
of
thin
dark
blue
trimmed
with
some
strange
syrian
lace
bought
it
from
a
syrian
peddler
it
s
the
real
oh
dad
it
s
lovely
but
for
just
one
night
it
must
have
cost
a
fortune
not
so
great
a
fortune
was
his
smiling
reply
besides
in
times
like
these
when
we
live
so
fast
one
night
of
perfect
happiness
can
be
treasured
for
days
on
one
night
of
happiness
she
repeated
softly
that
sounds
wonderful
i
m
hoping
it
may
be
wonderful
the
dance
is
to
be
held
at
the
officers
club
quite
a
splendid
place
it
s
really
a
british
affair
but
we
re
all
in
on
it
just
as
we
are
in
the
big
fight
once
a
week
officers
motor
from
long
distances
and
bring
the
ladies
the
colonel
s
lady
he
laughed
i
tried
to
get
your
partner
sparky
in
on
the
dance
he
added
he
turned
me
down
said
he
needed
the
time
for
getting
the
plane
in
shape
but
he
did
promise
to
have
dinner
with
dad
he
s
wonderful
sparky
is
mary
enthused
the
only
trouble
with
him
is
a
wistful
note
stole
into
her
voice
he
s
just
a
machine
like
those
engines
he
watches
so
you
re
lucky
to
have
a
partner
like
that
there
s
only
one
in
a
hundred
like
him
you
could
fly
all
the
way
around
the
world
with
looks
as
if
we
might
do
just
your
destination
is
china
what
route
do
you
take
on
your
return
to
america
m
afraid
we
never
gave
it
a
thought
our
journey
s
end
comes
yes
of
course
you
ll
return
by
way
of
australia
or
alaska
either
will
be
and
dangerous
well
now
his
voice
changed
get
on
your
party
dress
and
we
ll
be
on
our
a
maid
appeared
from
nowhere
she
had
in
truth
been
borrowed
from
a
beauty
parlor
when
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
after
the
maid
had
done
her
work
mary
gasped
then
experienced
a
sinking
feeling
about
her
knees
sparky
she
thought
he
ll
put
on
his
everyday
coat
and
come
strolling
over
to
the
club
for
dinner
it
s
a
shame
i
wish
i
could
wear
my
uniform
with
a
few
spots
on
it
but
then
perhaps
she
did
not
know
sparky
or
was
it
young
captain
ramsey
who
had
engineered
the
transformation
be
that
as
it
may
as
she
entered
the
club
she
looked
sparky
up
and
down
for
a
full
ten
seconds
before
she
knew
him
sparky
you
old
rogue
she
exclaimed
why
you
re
actually
handsome
i
d
like
she
advanced
toward
him
with
shining
eyes
blushing
sparky
backed
away
it
says
in
the
bible
he
drawled
that
you
should
let
your
moderation
appear
before
all
men
you
re
not
looking
so
bad
yourself
he
added
in
a
low
tone
but
pardner
this
is
no
sort
of
armor
for
a
fightin
fool
when
do
we
eat
colonel
mason
led
them
to
a
table
in
the
corner
where
the
lights
were
subdued
and
there
they
took
their
places
mary
sparky
ramsey
and
the
colonel
the
food
mary
discovered
was
wonderful
she
whispered
to
her
father
something
like
that
he
smiled
however
it
gets
here
it
s
deserved
all
the
men
you
see
here
british
french
or
american
are
on
active
duty
most
of
them
are
fliers
some
have
just
returned
from
tunisia
where
they
have
been
on
duty
for
long
weeks
half
their
squadron
was
shot
down
some
are
guarding
the
airways
as
captain
ramsey
will
be
doing
tomorrow
almost
every
day
some
fine
fellow
fails
to
but
they
seem
so
happy
and
her
eyes
swept
the
large
room
filled
with
laughing
chattering
men
and
their
ladies
certainly
what
do
you
ask
was
the
quick
reply
you
just
must
believe
in
your
luck
and
keep
your
sense
of
humor
you
who
have
come
a
long
way
should
know
she
agreed
yes
of
course
i
know
just
then
young
captain
ramsey
claimed
her
attention
for
the
next
half
hour
he
held
it
while
the
colonel
and
sparky
were
busy
comparing
notes
on
the
performance
of
various
types
of
airplanes
she
and
ramsey
talked
and
laughed
as
they
compared
notes
on
the
lives
they
had
lived
before
the
war
descended
upon
them
it
will
never
be
the
same
she
sighed
at
last
of
course
it
won
t
he
agreed
but
do
you
really
wish
it
don
t
know
she
hesitated
of
course
you
don
t
none
of
us
does
we
ve
been
whirled
completely
out
of
that
world
when
we
get
back
if
we
his
voice
fell
then
s
the
only
time
we
ll
really
know
what
we
want
that
s
why
i
say
forget
the
problems
let
s
get
on
with
the
look
she
gripped
his
arm
there
s
an
arab
the
is
bringing
him
this
way
oh
i
m
arabs
are
harmless
he
gave
her
a
questioning
look
not
all
who
pass
as
arabs
are
harmless
she
insisted
there
was
no
time
for
explaining
the
arab
with
the
at
his
elbow
had
arrived
at
their
table
chapter
ix
a
roll
of
papyrus
i
tried
to
tell
him
sir
that
it
was
not
right
that
he
should
come
in
the
polite
waiter
apologized
to
the
colonel
mary
s
father
i
said
it
is
not
convenient
it
is
not
allowed
but
he
would
it
s
all
right
pierre
the
colonel
spoke
quietly
what
is
it
you
wish
he
turned
to
the
arab
oh
sir
if
you
the
arab
spoke
english
without
a
flaw
you
are
interested
in
egypt
all
her
past
yes
yes
i
know
it
is
the
man
drew
something
from
beneath
his
robe
both
sparky
and
ramsey
half
rose
in
their
places
then
settled
back
for
the
arab
s
fingers
long
and
thin
held
what
appeared
to
be
a
roll
of
paper
taking
the
roll
the
colonel
removed
the
outer
layer
of
green
paper
of
a
peculiar
tint
then
examined
the
dull
gray
roll
beneath
is
it
papyrus
he
asked
yes
colonel
came
in
a
whisper
from
an
ancient
tomb
it
is
i
believe
three
thousand
years
the
colonel
made
no
reply
instead
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
small
powerful
magnifying
glass
mary
who
was
watching
the
arab
saw
a
sudden
look
of
fear
pass
over
his
face
it
was
little
more
than
a
flitting
shadow
yet
she
was
to
recall
it
in
the
days
to
come
yes
said
the
colonel
after
a
minute
examination
of
the
roll
it
is
papyrus
beyond
a
doubt
it
is
quite
old
and
i
suppose
you
want
to
sell
it
oh
no
no
no
the
man
s
face
was
twisted
into
a
look
of
terror
it
is
not
for
me
to
sell
i
must
send
it
to
spinka
he
is
a
great
egyptologist
his
home
is
in
but
i
am
not
returning
to
america
perhaps
i
shall
never
ah
yes
but
the
young
the
arab
leaned
forward
hiding
the
roll
under
his
long
robe
she
is
but
a
visitor
is
it
not
so
she
will
return
very
soon
is
this
not
true
the
colonel
spoke
slowly
what
do
you
say
mary
will
you
accept
the
responsibility
no
was
the
quick
response
how
could
i
even
my
own
life
is
not
safe
only
ah
yes
it
is
true
the
arab
broke
in
today
yes
but
the
miserable
wretch
who
threatened
your
life
is
what
how
did
you
find
this
out
sparky
demanded
not
so
loud
my
friend
the
arab
spoke
in
a
hoarse
whisper
at
the
same
time
completely
covering
the
roll
there
are
those
who
would
kill
me
for
having
this
they
would
kill
me
as
quickly
mary
declared
ah
but
they
shall
not
know
it
shall
be
at
your
chateau
one
minute
before
you
go
you
fly
to
persia
i
do
not
ask
i
know
i
shall
not
speak
i
am
always
to
be
trusted
in
persia
they
do
not
care
for
papyrus
there
you
are
safe
wherever
you
go
you
are
mary
looked
to
her
father
for
the
answer
to
this
strange
problem
what
he
said
puzzled
her
more
than
a
little
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
take
this
with
you
at
my
house
and
the
airport
you
will
have
ample
protection
you
of
course
must
take
the
risk
of
its
being
destroyed
by
the
fortunes
of
he
spoke
to
the
arab
it
shall
be
in
the
hands
of
god
and
a
lady
was
the
reply
if
god
wills
its
destruction
i
shall
bare
my
head
as
for
the
lady
i
trust
it
is
then
so
the
colonel
the
roll
the
roll
must
be
in
my
hands
at
but
sir
the
plane
does
the
colonel
held
up
a
hand
none
but
god
is
permitted
to
know
the
hour
of
departure
do
you
say
it
is
the
will
of
the
arab
was
gone
the
two
hours
that
followed
will
linger
long
in
mary
s
memory
i
never
dreamed
of
anything
like
this
when
i
volunteered
for
this
trip
she
said
to
captain
ramsey
as
they
swung
away
for
the
dance
you
expected
only
blood
sweat
and
tears
he
replied
soberly
something
like
that
s
mostly
what
war
is
like
but
there
must
be
change
and
contrast
laughter
music
and
the
lighter
touch
or
we
break
and
then
we
re
no
music
laughter
and
the
lighter
touch
that
was
what
they
had
during
the
next
swiftly
passing
hours
the
dances
were
all
waltzes
the
strange
fantastic
could
not
name
half
the
very
well
there
was
a
wild
ecstasy
running
through
it
all
the
shrill
pipe
of
reed
instruments
the
of
strange
drums
at
times
set
her
blood
tingling
then
too
there
were
moments
of
quiet
swinging
rhythm
that
set
her
dreaming
the
people
too
were
interesting
intriguing
egyptian
women
slender
young
french
officers
smiling
little
french
ladies
with
faces
like
dolls
imperial
dames
from
the
british
these
swung
past
her
and
on
out
of
sight
illustration
quiet
swinging
rhythm
set
her
she
danced
with
ramsey
with
her
father
and
with
nice
british
and
american
boys
to
whom
she
was
introduced
this
she
said
to
ramsey
is
the
sort
of
life
i
used
to
but
not
now
he
asked
for
it
is
but
not
for
tomorrow
not
tomorrow
even
now
i
find
my
hands
reaching
for
the
controls
my
fingers
itching
for
the
feel
of
the
switches
and
my
ears
listening
for
the
roar
of
the
it
gets
in
your
blood
i
know
what
s
it
going
to
be
after
it
s
all
over
we
ll
know
when
it
is
all
over
if
we
re
still
around
to
know
let
s
have
tonight
for
and
tomorrow
for
the
music
ceased
that
dance
was
over
it
was
announced
that
the
orchestra
would
play
two
selections
that
were
not
dances
we
sit
these
out
come
on
he
led
her
by
the
hand
there
s
a
spot
before
the
fountain
where
we
can
sit
and
watch
the
does
it
need
watching
she
asked
with
a
laugh
it
seems
his
tone
was
sober
as
he
helped
her
to
a
seat
beneath
the
stars
i
like
to
watch
it
all
the
same
sometime
i
expect
it
to
speak
to
speak
to
you
yes
why
not
surely
it
s
stood
there
in
silence
long
enough
look
he
leaned
close
to
her
did
you
ever
think
what
that
great
pile
of
stone
over
there
stands
for
of
course
not
you
haven
t
watched
it
night
after
night
as
i
have
it
stands
for
power
that
s
what
the
power
one
man
wielded
over
thousands
and
thousands
of
others
think
of
the
weary
years
toiled
cutting
those
stones
with
primitive
tools
and
getting
them
up
up
up
toward
the
what
for
because
some
man
wanted
to
be
remembered
after
he
was
dead
they
did
remember
but
only
to
curse
him
we
have
our
monuments
today
skyscrapers
museums
places
for
fishes
to
live
in
homes
for
mummies
and
stuffed
elephants
they
have
been
built
by
men
who
wanted
to
be
remembered
but
the
people
who
pay
for
them
are
the
little
people
who
have
made
machines
sold
goods
and
all
that
for
a
little
pay
and
who
were
left
to
finish
their
lives
as
best
they
could
when
they
were
too
old
to
work
any
more
that
is
what
the
pyramid
will
say
to
me
some
moonlit
and
what
shall
you
do
about
it
probably
nothing
just
as
other
generations
have
done
but
see
here
he
sprang
to
his
feet
this
was
to
be
a
night
of
music
laughter
and
the
lighter
she
supplied
the
words
well
there
s
the
music
isn
t
it
lovely
when
it
was
over
and
they
were
sauntering
back
toward
the
dance
floor
he
said
i
m
to
be
up
there
with
you
over
the
arabian
desert
tomorrow
rommel
s
desert
rats
have
a
hidden
base
somewhere
out
there
we
lose
a
plane
now
and
then
never
get
a
trace
of
it
it
seems
your
father
doesn
t
want
you
to
get
i
think
you
re
there
will
be
three
other
escorting
planes
in
the
squad
they
will
all
be
double
seaters
i
ll
be
in
a
a
regular
blue
devil
of
a
fighting
so
i
ll
be
able
to
recognize
you
how
grand
she
enthused
you
shall
be
my
knight
in
shining
sure
it
s
like
going
back
to
ancient
days
when
fair
ladies
and
rich
treasure
in
coaches
were
guarded
on
their
way
by
armored
knights
on
swift
steeds
you
ride
now
she
laughed
real
enough
for
all
that
the
lady
is
real
too
and
the
treasure
never
forget
i
shall
not
have
you
any
notion
what
the
treasure
is
not
the
slightest
all
we
know
sparky
and
i
is
that
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
to
china
and
that
it
must
go
here
we
are
he
said
helping
her
up
the
steps
one
more
one
more
and
that
s
all
she
agreed
i
must
have
my
beauty
nap
for
tomorrow
i
am
a
working
woman
a
short
time
later
they
said
to
the
colonel
who
assured
them
he
was
leaving
at
once
then
he
drove
her
home
in
his
car
it
s
been
the
most
delightful
evening
of
my
life
she
declared
it
s
the
contrast
was
his
reply
today
you
were
in
great
she
had
told
him
of
her
adventure
with
the
spy
tonight
you
have
been
safe
with
the
right
kind
of
people
and
quite
and
tomorrow
who
knows
i
shall
be
with
you
in
the
arabian
skies
that
much
is
decided
the
rest
is
he
went
with
her
to
the
door
of
the
chateau
then
gripping
her
hand
he
whispered
just
something
to
she
did
not
refuse
a
moment
later
a
little
flushed
and
quite
happy
she
was
in
her
own
room
preparing
for
a
few
winks
of
sleep
she
was
just
putting
on
the
night
robe
that
had
been
left
for
her
when
her
father
entered
the
chateau
have
a
good
time
he
asked
best
that
s
splendid
i
wish
you
were
to
be
here
a
i
don
t
was
the
quick
reply
i
love
duty
and
i
m
ashamed
to
say
it
danger
but
dad
i
don
t
see
this
papyrus
business
why
should
i
take
that
roll
to
america
why
shouldn
t
you
it
might
be
there
s
scarcely
a
chance
in
the
first
place
i
know
that
arab
he
seems
an
honorable
old
man
in
the
second
i
shall
place
your
overnight
bag
in
your
plane
the
moment
before
you
and
the
roll
will
be
in
that
bag
exactly
once
you
are
in
the
air
the
roll
can
not
possibly
get
you
into
trouble
when
you
arrive
at
your
destination
there
is
not
a
chance
in
a
thousand
that
anyone
there
will
know
about
that
any
papyrus
for
that
matter
so
you
he
went
on
you
will
be
aiding
this
aged
arab
and
at
the
same
time
adding
a
little
to
our
american
collection
of
egyptian
lore
some
rare
discoveries
have
been
made
by
those
who
delve
into
the
mysteries
of
the
messages
recorded
thousands
of
years
perhaps
this
tells
of
some
war
fought
and
won
on
these
very
grounds
she
suggested
here
is
a
card
he
said
handing
her
a
square
of
cardboard
on
it
i
have
written
the
address
of
my
old
professor
of
egyptology
i
suggest
that
you
show
the
roll
to
him
before
you
deliver
it
to
this
doctor
why
well
he
hesitated
in
these
times
we
must
be
very
careful
there
is
an
off
chance
that
an
enemy
spy
is
working
through
this
arab
to
turn
a
sharp
trick
on
and
if
that
is
true
your
professor
will
discover
it
he
and
his
dad
you
ll
call
me
you
ll
be
at
the
airport
on
time
with
a
good
cup
of
coffee
and
toasted
english
muffins
under
your
the
off
chance
is
sometimes
the
real
chance
also
the
wisest
of
men
sometimes
make
mistakes
it
is
also
true
that
the
game
is
neither
won
nor
lost
until
the
last
card
is
played
the
roll
of
papyrus
went
aboard
mary
s
plane
as
planned
and
was
promptly
forgotten
chapter
x
two
can
hide
in
a
cloud
when
at
three
mary
walked
up
to
her
plane
she
found
ramsey
waiting
for
her
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
he
said
that
you
need
not
be
frightened
if
your
fighter
escort
seems
at
times
to
disappear
from
the
sky
how
could
you
even
over
the
desert
at
times
there
are
fleecy
white
clouds
like
a
filmy
party
and
you
hide
behind
the
dresses
but
the
quite
and
then
you
come
dashing
out
at
the
messerschmitts
right
again
that
may
seem
like
using
your
plane
as
a
decoy
perhaps
it
is
in
a
way
but
we
re
guarding
the
airways
and
we
must
get
those
flying
rats
two
of
our
finest
boys
the
grandest
in
the
world
vanished
over
that
desert
just
last
we
ll
be
seeing
she
climbed
up
to
take
her
place
in
the
plane
she
found
sparky
looking
rather
big
job
getting
that
burned
engine
into
shape
was
his
curt
explanation
i
m
all
rested
up
she
said
just
as
soon
as
we
re
well
in
the
sky
i
ll
take
the
ship
you
re
due
for
two
hour
s
guess
that
s
safe
he
handed
her
the
form
one
card
those
brigands
of
the
air
don
t
operate
close
to
this
she
studied
the
card
he
turned
on
fuel
and
ignition
then
tested
his
fuel
tanks
okay
he
murmured
at
that
he
primed
the
motors
set
the
energizer
whirling
nodded
to
the
mechanic
flipped
on
the
fuel
booster
nodded
once
more
to
the
mechanic
then
they
were
away
five
minutes
later
sparky
slipped
from
his
place
and
mary
had
the
big
ship
all
to
herself
it
was
a
marvelous
day
they
were
flying
at
eight
thousand
feet
the
indistinct
desert
trails
seemed
mere
lines
camel
trains
were
moving
insects
as
they
advanced
the
occasional
villages
began
to
disappear
at
times
she
imagined
that
she
saw
elephants
and
droves
of
zebras
close
to
the
same
water
hole
their
fighter
escort
caught
up
with
them
when
they
were
an
hour
from
port
that
was
the
name
mary
found
herself
giving
to
the
place
she
had
left
why
not
one
left
a
port
for
a
sea
lane
sea
lanes
were
carefully
guarded
these
days
their
fighter
escorts
were
like
destroyers
they
guarded
her
air
lane
and
her
plane
s
load
might
for
all
she
knew
be
more
precious
than
a
big
ocean
freighter
s
cargo
well
she
thought
we
re
fully
halfway
between
america
and
china
and
they
haven
t
got
us
yet
her
thoughts
broke
off
short
had
she
spotted
a
plane
flying
low
on
the
horizon
as
if
to
confirm
her
suspicion
her
escort
flew
in
close
she
recognized
the
long
slim
sleek
fighter
flown
by
ramsey
he
dropped
his
right
wing
in
salute
the
last
plane
in
ramsey
s
fighter
formation
gave
her
a
real
shock
the
pilot
dropped
the
plane
s
nose
then
pulled
it
up
short
as
if
he
were
riding
a
bucking
bronco
that
she
told
herself
is
one
of
dad
s
tricks
but
he
can
t
be
in
that
he
s
taught
the
trick
to
one
of
his
men
i
suppose
i
wonder
for
a
full
hour
after
that
she
zoomed
straight
on
we
ll
be
in
persia
in
a
few
hours
dining
in
one
of
those
rare
persian
for
her
persia
was
persia
the
persia
of
the
golden
moon
people
could
call
it
iran
if
they
chose
she
was
all
for
the
beauty
and
romance
that
had
been
persia
there
were
fleecy
white
clouds
in
the
sky
just
as
ramsey
had
said
the
members
of
their
flying
escort
seemed
to
be
playing
a
game
of
among
those
clouds
then
just
as
a
thicker
cloud
shut
her
off
from
the
light
of
the
sun
they
all
vanished
illustration
fighter
planes
guarded
her
air
at
that
moment
as
everything
took
on
a
darker
hue
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
lonely
little
world
all
her
own
she
wanted
to
call
sparky
but
could
not
get
the
consent
of
her
mind
to
do
so
poor
sparky
she
thought
he
works
so
hard
and
when
he
s
through
the
old
ship
moves
on
like
a
placid
another
quarter
hour
passed
and
then
suddenly
she
called
in
a
startled
voice
sparky
sparky
what
is
it
he
was
at
her
side
in
an
instant
she
did
not
answer
only
pointed
forward
and
down
then
set
her
plane
climbing
toward
a
cloud
at
the
same
time
driving
the
engines
into
a
tremendous
roar
four
powerful
enemy
fighters
were
all
but
upon
them
and
as
if
bent
upon
suicide
and
destruction
racing
straight
on
if
these
pilots
had
rejoiced
because
of
their
rare
find
their
exultation
was
short
lived
for
darting
from
a
cloud
a
flying
fury
sprang
straight
at
their
leader
ramsey
mary
exclaimed
it
s
ramsey
he
ll
be
killed
give
me
the
controls
sparky
s
voice
was
quiet
after
slowing
the
motors
he
continued
to
climb
it
s
our
only
chance
he
grumbled
not
much
of
a
chance
at
that
those
huns
are
too
close
if
it
wasn
t
for
those
fighters
of
ours
we
d
be
lost
before
you
could
say
it
mary
agreed
but
ramsey
ramsey
she
screamed
the
leader
of
the
messerschmitts
had
let
loose
a
burst
of
fire
at
ramsey
s
plane
but
tilting
his
ship
s
nose
he
had
gone
shooting
beneath
the
enemy
to
execute
a
turn
that
was
like
a
pinwheel
and
then
to
send
three
short
sharp
bursts
at
the
flying
hun
it
seemed
to
mary
as
she
looked
that
the
messerschmitt
had
been
sawed
squarely
in
two
it
doubled
up
began
to
smoke
then
went
spinning
down
i
ll
take
the
controls
she
said
you
man
the
machine
gun
they
may
come
straight
at
hardly
had
sparky
gripped
the
machine
gun
when
one
of
the
remaining
flying
bandits
came
zooming
in
he
s
got
a
cannon
mary
thought
he
ll
get
our
right
engine
and
but
he
didn
t
seeming
to
have
hopped
off
from
the
back
of
her
plane
a
fighter
leaped
straight
at
the
enemy
as
if
fearing
a
collision
in
the
enemy
pilot
banked
sharply
to
the
left
this
left
his
broadside
exposed
at
the
same
instant
both
the
gunner
of
the
and
sparky
let
go
a
smoking
fury
of
fire
for
a
moment
the
enemy
appeared
to
stand
still
in
then
its
nose
turned
swiftly
downward
as
it
went
into
a
spin
two
of
them
mary
exulted
we
ll
have
them
all
in
a
minute
but
when
it
comes
to
enemy
fighting
planes
it
would
seem
that
four
minus
two
equals
five
for
as
she
looked
again
she
saw
five
planes
zooming
straight
at
them
the
sun
came
out
from
behind
the
cloud
at
that
all
the
planes
shone
in
that
bright
light
mary
s
big
plane
with
its
precious
load
still
climbed
but
to
her
excited
mind
it
seemed
so
slow
like
a
lumbering
stage
coach
flashed
through
her
mind
the
fighters
too
climbed
it
was
one
of
those
times
when
a
minute
seems
an
hour
when
the
work
of
a
lifetime
is
rewarded
for
good
or
evil
in
a
trice
before
the
girl
s
astonished
eyes
a
rare
spectacle
of
the
air
formed
itself
then
put
on
its
deadly
show
six
planes
three
of
the
enemy
and
three
of
her
fighter
escort
formed
in
a
circle
each
striving
for
the
advantage
went
circling
round
and
round
it
was
ramsey
who
broke
this
up
darting
out
from
a
cloud
he
sent
a
burst
of
fire
into
the
enemy
plane
then
with
a
wide
swing
met
the
foremost
enemy
mary
caught
her
breath
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
must
crash
a
moment
more
and
they
were
hidden
by
smoke
one
had
been
hit
which
one
she
could
not
tell
free
for
the
moment
the
remaining
enemy
of
the
three
headed
straight
for
the
big
cargo
ship
then
it
was
that
the
pilot
who
had
given
her
the
salute
earlier
in
the
day
got
in
some
deadly
work
for
with
surprising
speed
he
got
on
this
last
plane
s
tail
and
brought
him
down
in
flames
good
work
she
screamed
but
ramsey
what
of
ramsey
she
was
soon
enough
to
know
after
allowing
her
eyes
to
sweep
the
sky
making
sure
that
the
two
other
enemy
planes
were
not
an
immediate
menace
she
turned
once
more
for
a
look
at
the
spot
where
ramsey
and
his
opponent
had
been
they
were
not
there
but
high
in
the
sky
and
still
climbing
ramsey
was
in
hot
pursuit
of
his
antagonist
both
planes
are
smoking
she
said
to
sparky
who
had
come
to
stand
at
her
side
but
neither
badly
was
the
quiet
reply
there
oh
there
she
exclaimed
the
spitfire
has
gone
into
a
nose
dive
don
t
expect
too
much
he
s
not
badly
scarcely
had
sparky
spoken
when
the
enemy
plane
coming
out
of
his
dive
spun
around
in
a
narrow
circle
to
get
on
ramsey
s
tail
and
let
forth
a
burst
of
fire
oh
he
s
got
him
poor
ramsey
s
gone
give
me
the
sparky
took
over
while
with
lips
parted
eyes
staring
mary
watched
for
the
end
the
end
was
not
yet
ramsey
s
slender
fighter
staggered
spun
half
about
tilted
over
did
two
complete
then
by
some
miracle
or
by
the
sheer
of
her
master
righted
herself
by
some
good
chance
ramsey
found
himself
facing
his
opponent
he
must
have
pressed
the
firing
button
and
given
her
the
works
for
the
enemy
plane
appeared
to
fall
to
pieces
in
however
until
its
pilot
had
sent
one
more
burst
of
fire
into
ramsey
s
smoking
plane
he
s
on
fire
he
s
going
down
mary
shouted
at
that
moment
she
was
seeing
war
in
all
its
stark
naked
horror
there
your
friend
ramsey
s
out
of
the
plane
sparky
said
quietly
as
ever
good
the
girl
settled
back
his
parachute
is
open
he
s
coming
down
but
sparky
we
ll
be
right
beneath
him
sparky
banked
sharply
to
the
right
mary
leaped
for
the
door
bracing
herself
against
the
current
of
air
she
threw
the
door
open
to
stand
there
waiting
looking
up
hoping
yes
there
he
was
drifting
down
he
was
closer
closer
much
closer
he
saw
her
she
could
see
him
smile
she
waved
he
waved
back
she
shouted
i
ll
be
seeing
you
he
could
not
hear
but
understood
with
his
hand
he
threw
her
a
kiss
then
he
was
gone
when
mary
brushed
her
hands
across
her
eyes
they
were
wet
with
tears
after
that
seated
beside
sparky
she
sat
in
silence
while
miles
of
desert
and
mountains
narrow
green
valleys
and
more
mountains
passed
beneath
them
until
with
surprising
suddenness
a
small
city
with
many
trees
domes
and
strange
rooftops
appeared
beneath
them
that
s
it
sparky
said
quietly
we
come
down
a
little
beyond
the
city
that
nestled
among
the
hills
they
dropped
into
a
narrow
valley
and
down
upon
a
landing
field
as
mary
stepped
from
the
plane
she
once
again
found
herself
staring
at
a
familiar
broad
back
and
as
the
man
turned
exclaimed
dad
it
s
you
chapter
xi
the
tumbling
donkey
ramsey
mary
caught
her
breath
did
did
he
land
safely
her
father
s
eyes
shone
of
course
he
did
i
followed
him
down
in
my
you
she
exclaimed
were
you
in
that
fight
surely
didn
t
you
recognize
my
salute
yes
you
didn
t
think
it
was
i
i
don
t
wonder
at
that
i
would
have
told
you
i
was
to
be
in
it
but
i
was
afraid
it
would
make
you
nervous
she
shuddered
after
today
i
shall
never
be
nervous
it
was
a
grand
fight
he
enthused
you
and
sparky
had
a
real
part
in
and
we
re
still
here
safe
and
sound
so
s
our
yes
he
frowned
but
that
was
a
narrow
escape
here
s
hoping
you
meet
with
nothing
like
that
on
the
remaining
laps
of
your
important
without
ramsey
and
you
it
would
have
been
ramsay
is
a
brave
and
skillful
fighter
i
ve
known
no
better
i
stayed
around
long
enough
to
see
that
he
was
picked
up
by
one
of
the
other
planes
then
my
gunner
and
i
flew
on
toward
persia
we
made
one
stop
for
fuel
but
beat
you
here
as
it
is
our
plane
is
really
fast
well
he
sighed
it
s
been
quite
a
day
we
cleaned
up
that
nest
of
hornets
two
of
them
got
away
but
we
ve
spotted
their
landing
field
and
can
finish
them
off
later
i
ve
got
a
little
business
here
you
ll
not
be
leaving
before
morning
he
said
turning
to
sparky
daylight
is
best
for
our
next
long
flight
said
sparky
and
it
pays
to
be
at
your
best
on
such
a
journey
colonel
mason
agreed
persia
is
worth
a
good
long
i
ll
be
looking
after
the
plane
said
sparky
hurrying
away
oh
my
overnight
bag
mary
called
hurrying
after
him
i
will
meet
you
at
the
desk
in
the
small
landing
field
depot
said
the
colonel
set
your
bag
in
this
corner
her
father
told
her
when
he
joined
her
in
the
depot
later
persian
coffee
is
not
bad
and
their
lemon
ice
is
really
hot
coffee
and
lemon
ice
she
laughed
as
she
dropped
into
a
low
rattan
chair
what
a
combination
try
it
you
ll
find
it
hits
the
spot
he
laughed
i
have
a
friend
in
the
city
he
told
her
a
wealthy
persian
merchant
he
takes
great
pride
in
his
garden
it
is
really
very
wonderful
i
want
you
to
see
it
but
first
we
ll
take
a
car
up
town
and
reserve
rooms
for
the
look
mary
exclaimed
springing
up
that
man
is
carrying
off
my
bag
quick
stop
him
that
roll
of
papyrus
why
no
her
father
stopped
her
there
s
your
bag
right
where
you
left
it
is
she
stared
in
surprise
but
think
of
a
man
having
an
overnight
bag
just
like
mine
and
in
such
a
strange
goods
go
everywhere
my
merchant
friend
sells
many
articles
from
america
most
of
the
cotton
used
in
his
prints
comes
from
for
all
that
mary
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
as
she
picked
up
her
bag
it
s
that
roll
of
papyrus
she
sighed
i
wouldn
t
mind
about
the
other
things
i
suppose
they
could
all
be
replaced
from
the
shops
right
up
here
in
the
city
every
item
he
agreed
at
that
they
did
not
know
the
half
of
it
a
few
moments
later
they
hailed
a
cab
and
rode
up
to
the
strange
little
city
half
hidden
among
the
barren
hills
you
ll
not
see
anything
like
it
for
a
long
time
he
assured
her
having
secured
a
suite
of
three
rooms
in
a
small
hotel
they
departed
after
depositing
their
bags
for
a
look
at
the
city
we
ll
hire
a
couple
of
donkeys
her
father
said
and
ride
up
to
the
bazaar
that
s
the
most
colorful
spot
of
all
and
that
too
is
where
we
will
find
my
friend
of
the
glorious
mary
felt
very
much
as
if
she
were
riding
astride
a
child
s
scooter
as
their
shaggy
donkeys
crept
down
the
hot
dusty
street
it
all
takes
you
back
into
the
past
she
said
yes
a
thousand
but
it
s
charming
for
all
that
a
glorious
place
to
after
riding
down
narrow
winding
streets
they
came
to
the
gates
of
the
bazaar
which
with
its
vaulted
roof
offered
cooling
shade
from
the
heat
of
the
day
we
ride
in
her
father
explained
how
odd
she
said
patted
her
donkey
and
in
they
went
at
once
they
found
themselves
in
a
jam
of
donkeys
camels
and
perspiring
men
avarda
avarda
sounded
on
every
side
what
do
they
mary
asked
that
means
make
room
her
father
explained
all
right
she
laughed
avarda
avarda
they
came
at
last
to
the
shops
where
men
sat
in
the
midst
of
their
wares
here
were
piles
of
cups
saucers
pitchers
and
plates
there
were
all
manner
of
brooms
here
piles
of
cheap
cotton
prints
and
over
in
this
corner
long
flowing
gowns
my
friend
has
a
large
shop
back
a
little
from
the
others
the
colonel
explained
this
seems
a
quiet
spot
hold
my
donkey
i
ll
be
he
hurried
up
a
flight
of
narrow
stairs
to
mary
the
passing
throng
arabs
syrians
black
slaves
jews
with
packs
on
their
backs
and
portly
strangers
of
seeming
importance
were
a
fascinating
study
in
character
and
life
it
was
a
man
of
portly
importance
who
at
last
caught
her
attention
she
had
seen
him
before
but
where
one
swift
glimpse
at
the
picture
walls
of
her
memory
and
she
knew
he
was
the
man
who
had
been
carrying
a
bag
exactly
like
her
own
just
then
their
eyes
met
for
ten
seconds
his
startled
eyes
were
upon
her
then
shouting
avarda
avarda
he
forced
his
stout
donkey
through
the
throng
all
but
running
several
people
down
at
last
disappearing
from
sight
how
strange
she
murmured
illustration
sat
in
the
midst
of
their
all
too
soon
she
was
to
learn
that
his
actions
had
more
meaning
than
they
appeared
to
have
it
is
all
her
father
was
again
at
her
side
we
are
to
be
at
the
garden
gate
in
just
two
hours
you
ll
find
it
fascinating
the
experience
of
a
in
these
days
she
replied
slowly
each
experience
is
one
of
a
lifetime
i
just
saw
the
man
who
has
an
overnight
bag
like
mine
she
added
did
you
what
of
that
i
don
t
really
know
he
ducked
that
s
all
rode
a
donkey
right
through
the
that
s
it
sure
when
some
twenty
minutes
later
in
search
of
a
clean
handkerchief
mary
opened
her
bag
she
let
out
a
gasp
why
this
is
not
my
bag
her
father
stared
it
must
be
it
s
not
these
garments
are
not
mine
nothing
is
mine
and
she
ran
her
hand
through
the
carefully
packed
bag
the
roll
of
papyrus
is
not
here
that
man
must
somehow
have
gotten
his
bag
mixed
with
but
this
is
a
lady
s
it
must
belong
to
his
but
he
s
fat
a
dutchman
or
german
i
think
who
ever
heard
of
a
slender
german
housefrau
and
these
clothes
are
my
she
held
up
a
shimmering
dream
robe
it
s
the
strangest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
she
said
when
after
five
minutes
of
examining
the
contents
of
the
bag
she
held
up
a
beautiful
party
dress
you
d
think
that
my
bag
had
been
burned
up
contents
and
all
and
that
someone
who
knew
the
contents
very
well
had
gone
to
the
trouble
of
replacing
it
piece
by
piece
every
article
here
is
brand
new
only
the
papyrus
roll
is
it
is
strange
her
father
agreed
but
the
ways
of
enemy
spies
are
past
finding
out
or
perhaps
he
was
only
an
oriental
a
thief
of
bagdad
something
like
that
the
roll
of
papyrus
may
be
quite
valuable
worth
many
thousands
that
depends
upon
the
egyptian
dynasty
from
which
it
came
museums
pay
almost
any
price
for
certain
rare
writings
from
those
ancient
why
did
i
accept
it
mary
moaned
why
did
i
encourage
you
to
accept
it
he
amended
perhaps
time
will
bring
the
answer
then
again
there
may
be
no
real
answer
come
let
s
get
ready
for
the
persian
garden
party
we
have
quite
a
way
to
go
and
donkeys
are
slow
you
didn
t
happen
to
have
any
secret
papers
in
your
traveling
bag
did
you
he
asked
as
they
rode
toward
his
friend
s
garden
home
none
whatever
not
even
a
letter
sparky
keeps
all
our
papers
in
a
secret
compartment
of
the
plane
that
s
where
the
papyrus
should
have
been
but
who
would
that
anyone
in
persia
would
be
interested
in
that
roll
yes
or
know
anything
about
the
enemy
s
network
of
spies
is
vast
and
endless
without
doubt
they
have
radio
connections
with
every
large
you
keep
hinting
that
the
papyrus
carries
a
secret
message
or
something
you
surely
don
t
think
a
message
written
so
long
ago
means
anything
to
this
generation
there
are
those
who
do
i
can
find
you
men
who
will
tell
you
how
this
war
is
to
end
they
found
it
all
written
out
in
the
koran
or
the
you
re
not
clearing
things
up
let
s
forget
the
whole
business
he
suggested
we
accepted
no
responsibility
only
agreed
to
try
to
get
the
roll
to
america
well
at
present
it
appears
that
we
have
failed
the
sun
is
lower
now
my
friend
s
garden
will
be
delightful
let
us
sing
while
we
the
garden
was
all
that
he
had
promised
and
more
having
arrived
at
a
massive
gate
in
a
wall
they
tethered
their
donkeys
then
knocked
the
gate
swung
open
and
they
stepped
inside
look
up
said
the
colonel
how
gorgeous
mary
exclaimed
as
her
eyes
feasted
themselves
on
the
scene
that
lay
above
them
up
a
steep
slope
ran
two
stone
walks
between
these
walks
a
small
stream
of
water
gurgled
and
danced
over
bright
colored
tiles
between
the
walks
and
water
were
narrow
flower
beds
all
aglow
with
blossoms
here
and
there
the
stream
spread
out
into
a
pool
or
rose
into
a
spouting
fountain
about
the
pools
were
more
flowers
while
on
the
surface
water
pads
with
yellow
as
they
walked
slowly
up
the
narrow
walk
the
valley
widened
a
little
low
trees
began
to
appear
on
either
side
beyond
this
they
saw
a
small
house
that
was
all
doors
and
windows
it
s
out
of
a
story
book
mary
whispered
yes
arabian
nights
her
father
agreed
they
entered
the
house
at
its
center
a
small
fountain
played
about
its
walls
were
low
benches
piled
high
with
cushions
oh
mary
breathed
settling
herself
among
the
cushions
why
must
life
go
on
and
on
when
it
could
end
itself
in
a
blaze
of
glory
right
here
her
father
laughed
but
made
no
reply
for
a
long
time
they
remained
silent
gazing
at
the
scene
before
them
bright
flowers
gently
swaying
trees
dashing
water
and
beyond
that
in
sharp
contrast
dull
brown
barren
hills
and
grassless
valleys
it
s
like
life
mary
whispered
beautiful
and
gay
then
somber
and
however
it
seemed
that
for
the
time
their
lives
were
to
be
filled
with
beauty
gayety
and
charm
for
here
was
their
jovial
host
and
with
him
two
black
slaves
bearing
trays
of
fruit
cakes
and
tea
when
the
tea
and
cakes
were
gone
they
sat
for
a
time
in
silence
just
resting
and
admiring
the
scene
that
lay
beneath
their
feet
this
is
one
time
when
i
wish
i
could
paint
pictures
mary
murmured
at
last
the
charm
of
our
little
world
here
is
its
contrast
said
the
host
pleased
by
her
words
without
the
brown
hills
beyond
our
gardens
would
not
seem
half
as
once
again
there
was
silence
for
a
time
and
then
came
the
slaves
bringing
rice
cooked
with
meat
a
roast
of
mutton
bread
cheese
fruit
and
light
red
wine
ah
a
feast
the
colonel
exclaimed
we
have
very
little
here
in
the
hills
his
host
apologized
in
true
eastern
fashion
it
is
wonderful
said
mary
and
more
wonderful
still
to
have
time
for
enjoying
it
tomorrow
we
shall
be
rushing
through
the
air
once
when
there
is
a
feast
one
forgets
tomorrow
said
their
host
illustration
it
s
out
of
a
story
book
mary
but
mary
could
not
forget
she
thought
of
many
things
the
bag
the
boy
beachcomber
she
had
left
behind
in
south
america
of
the
fine
boys
of
the
desert
and
ramsey
who
had
guarded
her
so
well
and
of
the
vanishing
papyrus
what
of
tomorrow
she
asked
herself
with
one
ear
she
was
catching
threads
of
a
conversation
yes
he
is
short
and
rather
fat
her
father
was
saying
rather
pompous
a
dutchman
or
perhaps
a
yes
i
think
i
know
him
was
their
host
s
reply
he
says
he
is
from
holland
he
trades
in
cheap
pottery
and
sometimes
in
toys
i
think
he
is
german
we
shall
catch
up
with
that
man
you
and
she
knew
they
were
speaking
of
the
man
who
had
taken
her
bag
they
were
to
catch
up
with
that
man
sooner
than
she
thought
not
her
father
and
their
host
but
her
father
and
herself
night
was
falling
as
they
rode
back
into
the
village
they
were
passing
along
a
street
lined
on
one
side
by
low
homes
and
on
the
other
by
a
hill
that
sloped
away
from
them
when
they
caught
up
with
a
vaguely
familiar
figure
it
can
t
be
that
i
know
him
the
girl
thought
he
is
wearing
a
long
persian
robe
i
am
acquainted
with
no
the
man
turned
to
look
back
starting
she
whispered
there
s
that
man
they
were
abreast
of
him
when
suddenly
the
wind
blew
back
his
robe
giving
them
a
moment
s
glimpse
at
a
flash
of
peculiar
green
then
it
was
that
the
colonel
did
a
strange
thing
apparently
he
kicked
his
donkey
in
the
back
of
the
forelegs
for
suddenly
he
stumbled
and
fell
to
his
knees
at
the
same
time
the
colonel
went
over
sideways
with
a
lunge
that
carried
both
him
and
the
astonished
pedestrian
in
a
persian
robe
over
the
edge
of
the
road
and
half
way
down
the
steep
decline
expecting
a
struggle
and
perhaps
shots
mary
sprang
from
her
donkey
there
were
no
shots
instead
in
the
half
darkness
she
saw
one
shadowy
figure
go
gliding
down
the
hill
while
the
other
came
struggling
back
up
dad
did
you
get
it
she
whispered
greatly
excited
if
i
hadn
t
i
would
be
going
down
not
he
was
panting
a
little
couldn
t
you
hold
him
didn
t
want
you
didn
t
want
to
you
don
t
know
the
laws
of
the
medes
and
her
father
laughed
low
they
alter
not
and
if
we
had
him
put
in
jail
you
d
be
here
until
christmas
as
a
wise
old
she
patted
him
on
the
back
but
see
our
donkeys
are
gone
let
them
go
i
have
paid
for
their
use
they
ll
find
their
own
way
home
to
their
supper
we
ll
catch
a
cab
and
get
out
to
the
airport
at
why
the
word
was
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
but
she
did
not
say
it
chapter
xii
sealed
orders
once
they
were
safely
stowed
away
in
a
cab
he
pulled
the
package
from
his
pocket
papyrus
he
said
softly
like
our
paper
of
today
has
caused
a
lot
of
trouble
in
the
world
today
a
printing
press
rattles
and
bangs
for
an
hour
or
two
and
not
many
weeks
later
two
groups
of
men
one
a
band
of
thugs
the
other
a
squad
of
officers
shoot
it
out
for
possession
of
that
printing
press
s
work
and
all
because
it
says
on
each
slip
of
paper
payable
to
the
bearer
on
but
why
would
that
man
risk
his
life
to
get
that
roll
of
ancient
papyrus
mary
asked
that
said
her
father
appears
to
be
something
i
must
find
out
you
or
i
you
are
practically
out
of
it
we
re
taking
the
roll
to
sparky
he
ll
hide
it
in
his
secret
compartment
for
the
night
when
i
fly
back
to
egypt
tomorrow
the
roll
will
go
with
why
mary
s
eyes
opened
wide
hasn
t
it
caused
you
enough
trouble
not
if
it
s
really
it
seems
to
be
all
of
then
why
should
i
give
it
up
now
she
was
very
much
in
earnest
you
know
in
a
very
old
book
i
sometimes
read
it
says
something
about
putting
your
hand
to
the
plow
then
turning
back
i
don
t
like
turning
back
or
giving
up
it
s
part
of
my
religion
not
so
that
s
the
way
you
feel
about
it
yes
she
hesitated
one
thing
is
more
important
than
the
your
ship
s
cargo
i
agree
with
you
it
is
helping
to
get
it
through
to
china
is
the
most
important
task
you
ve
ever
undertaken
or
perhaps
ever
will
taking
the
papyrus
make
that
harder
i
doubt
that
sparky
will
always
be
with
the
ship
it
is
true
that
somehow
the
enemy
agents
here
have
learned
of
the
papyrus
and
wanting
it
for
god
knows
what
reason
have
made
a
play
for
it
but
will
they
carry
this
on
even
in
india
and
china
i
doubt
that
when
you
hop
off
from
here
you
will
be
headed
for
quite
another
another
world
she
repeated
the
words
softly
that
sounds
strange
and
and
rather
frightening
but
unless
you
seriously
object
the
papyrus
goes
with
sparky
and
me
to
that
other
then
that
s
settled
he
agreed
and
now
here
they
were
at
the
airport
well
for
once
mary
exclaimed
as
they
came
up
to
the
plane
here
s
sparky
and
he
s
not
working
on
the
engines
what
s
the
matter
sparky
are
you
sick
he
drawled
couldn
t
think
of
a
thing
that
needed
doing
so
i
ve
just
been
reading
a
book
about
persia
quite
a
place
i
d
we
ll
watch
the
ship
while
you
look
the
city
over
the
colonel
volunteered
oh
no
thanks
all
the
sparky
s
face
crinkled
into
a
smile
i
m
turning
on
the
job
you
a
few
minutes
we
ll
take
off
at
dawn
you
ll
be
here
mary
yep
and
sparky
since
you
re
guarding
the
ship
here
s
one
more
little
thing
you
can
keep
an
eye
on
put
it
in
our
oh
sure
what
is
it
just
a
bunch
of
old
it
was
the
colonel
who
replied
very
old
mary
grinned
oh
yes
i
remember
that
old
arab
s
stuff
sparky
yawned
lot
of
trouble
for
very
little
i
d
yes
mary
agreed
a
whole
lot
of
she
laughed
and
sparky
wondered
why
when
mary
and
her
father
their
rooms
at
the
hotel
a
later
things
seemed
a
little
strange
i
left
that
bag
on
that
low
bench
mary
recalled
now
it
s
standing
beside
the
bench
what
s
more
it
doesn
t
look
quite
the
picking
it
up
she
turned
it
on
its
side
placed
it
on
the
bench
then
threw
back
the
snaps
up
came
the
lid
dad
she
exclaimed
it
s
my
bag
the
things
are
all
there
even
a
candy
bar
i
bought
at
the
in
very
kind
of
our
nazi
friends
to
return
it
probably
came
in
through
the
he
wandered
about
testing
the
catches
that
s
right
he
called
at
last
the
window
in
my
sleeping
room
is
lock
it
please
said
mary
m
feeling
a
little
you
ll
be
all
right
when
the
windows
are
locked
and
the
shades
and
she
was
dad
she
said
after
a
few
moments
of
quiet
thought
perhaps
that
other
bag
belonged
to
the
woman
in
the
woman
in
black
yes
don
t
you
remember
the
one
who
seemed
to
be
working
with
the
jap
spy
who
posed
as
an
she
was
in
west
yes
of
course
and
then
i
ll
never
be
sure
that
the
french
woman
at
the
port
and
the
arab
woman
at
the
secret
oasis
were
the
same
you
ll
probably
never
know
that
was
his
reply
however
it
would
be
my
guess
that
they
were
two
different
people
and
if
there
is
really
a
woman
mixed
up
in
this
affair
of
the
papyrus
that
she
is
still
another
in
this
country
and
in
africa
where
spies
are
common
it
is
not
difficult
to
maintain
a
regular
fraternity
of
lady
spies
to
pass
on
a
message
from
spy
to
spy
is
easy
but
for
one
spy
to
travel
by
plane
from
place
to
place
in
territory
controlled
by
our
friends
is
practically
impossible
at
any
rate
your
bag
is
back
and
so
is
the
papyrus
and
that
for
the
moment
is
all
that
matters
and
i
m
surely
going
to
see
you
safely
off
in
the
in
spite
of
the
mysterious
events
of
the
day
and
her
strange
surroundings
mary
slept
well
that
night
why
not
was
not
her
father
close
at
hand
had
he
not
been
with
her
during
the
greater
part
of
her
life
and
had
she
not
always
felt
secure
when
he
was
near
she
awoke
an
hour
before
dawn
to
wish
with
all
her
soul
that
he
was
going
with
them
all
the
way
to
the
very
end
but
this
she
knew
was
impossible
he
had
stretched
a
point
coming
this
far
his
work
was
in
egypt
keeping
the
airways
clear
he
must
turn
back
she
bounded
out
of
bed
and
a
half
hour
later
sprang
from
their
car
to
greet
the
cold
gray
dawn
sunshine
fountains
flowers
and
now
this
all
a
part
of
life
she
thought
with
a
shudder
after
switching
on
the
plane
s
lights
she
crowded
her
way
back
through
the
cabin
she
examined
each
package
with
care
counted
them
and
then
in
one
fleeting
thought
asked
herself
what
their
contents
might
be
for
the
time
the
roll
of
papyrus
was
forgotten
only
one
thing
mattered
cargo
finding
everything
she
worked
her
way
back
to
the
cabin
door
to
stand
there
polishing
her
glasses
suddenly
she
found
herself
staring
at
the
square
of
white
with
which
the
polishing
was
being
done
that
s
not
my
handkerchief
she
exclaimed
it
has
embroidery
in
the
corners
a
date
palm
in
one
corner
and
a
flying
bird
in
the
you
must
have
picked
it
up
somewhere
her
father
suggested
digging
into
her
purse
for
her
own
handkerchief
she
pulled
out
one
more
of
the
same
pattern
this
she
exclaimed
is
getting
then
oh
i
remember
there
was
that
strange
bag
last
night
you
know
i
needed
a
handkerchief
my
bag
was
so
you
took
those
and
you
have
them
still
well
you
got
something
out
of
that
adventure
he
laughed
they
were
up
and
away
at
dawn
as
the
sun
rose
over
the
gray
hills
painting
them
with
a
golden
light
it
seemed
to
mary
that
now
nothing
could
hinder
them
from
reaching
their
distant
goal
in
china
two
days
later
weary
but
happy
she
found
herself
looking
down
on
the
rooftops
and
strange
towers
of
a
great
city
like
a
broad
ribbon
a
river
divided
the
city
into
two
parts
while
far
away
glimmering
in
the
sun
lay
the
ocean
this
sparky
s
voice
was
hoarse
with
emotion
this
is
the
heart
of
as
usual
they
passed
over
the
city
to
drop
down
upon
a
secluded
airport
all
but
hidden
by
tropical
trees
they
had
made
an
overnight
stop
just
within
the
border
of
india
from
that
airport
they
had
radioed
the
probable
hour
of
arrival
mary
was
surprised
to
see
a
small
crowd
of
people
race
on
the
field
as
their
plane
came
to
a
stop
when
at
last
she
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
plane
blinking
from
the
bright
sun
there
came
a
loud
roar
of
applause
which
fairly
set
her
back
on
her
feet
what
is
it
she
turned
to
sparky
they
must
think
we
re
a
big
league
baseball
team
or
there
are
a
lot
of
americans
here
he
explained
that
s
including
the
soldiers
you
re
the
first
lady
member
of
the
ferry
command
that
s
ever
showed
up
ray
ray
ray
for
the
lady
pilot
a
soldier
shouted
hurrah
hurrah
came
roaring
back
mary
said
never
a
word
just
stood
there
blinking
in
the
sun
then
an
attractive
young
lady
came
up
close
i
m
judy
pierce
from
the
big
school
for
girls
here
i
heard
you
were
to
arrive
and
i
wish
you
would
be
my
guest
while
you
re
that
would
be
just
how
about
it
and
how
long
mary
asked
sparky
ought
to
be
swell
how
long
that
i
can
t
this
is
a
city
judy
pierce
said
we
have
phones
and
everything
we
can
keep
in
touch
with
you
at
the
that
will
be
quite
all
right
sparky
agreed
speech
we
want
a
speech
some
boy
from
kansas
iowa
or
oklahoma
shouted
speech
speech
speech
came
in
a
chorus
i
can
t
make
a
speech
mary
s
voice
carried
across
the
field
all
i
can
do
is
to
fly
a
plane
and
i
don
t
know
too
much
about
that
but
it
does
make
me
feel
as
if
i
had
gone
round
the
world
and
got
back
home
to
see
you
all
here
i
know
now
as
i
never
knew
before
that
the
sun
never
really
sets
on
the
army
of
the
illustration
i
m
judy
pierce
said
an
attractive
young
there
came
one
more
roar
of
applause
during
which
mary
leaned
over
to
say
to
her
friend
i
ll
be
ready
in
just
a
little
that
s
fine
judy
smiled
i
have
my
small
car
we
ll
be
in
the
city
before
you
know
oh
a
car
mary
exclaimed
then
i
must
be
back
at
that
she
dodged
back
into
the
plane
there
she
came
upon
sparky
waving
two
envelopes
in
the
air
sealed
orders
he
whispered
hoarsely
one
is
to
be
opened
here
that
s
got
to
be
done
before
you
oh
mary
breathed
now
we
ll
know
not
all
of
it
sparky
warned
only
part
and
the
least
exciting
part
is
my
they
crowded
back
into
a
dark
corner
of
the
plane

shoulder

read
the
note
that
came
from
the
envelope
the
boxes
marked
c
they
read
are
to
be
to
the
burma
front
they
contain
quinine
and
should
be
guarded
with
the
greatest
quinine
mary
dropped
down
upon
a
case
marked
c
is
that
what
we
re
risking
our
lives
to
defend
every
has
quinine
not
any
more
said
sparky
the
supply
in
those
cases
came
from
thousands
of
druggists
in
the
they
donated
it
to
the
men
who
are
fighting
in
the
mosquito
plagued
swamps
of
burma
and
don
t
you
think
it
doesn
t
he
shook
a
finger
at
our
last
landing
i
saw
a
man
who
came
from
those
swamps
he
was
being
sent
home
they
thought
he
might
live
but
you
should
have
seen
him
oh
no
you
shouldn
t
it
was
terrible
to
see
a
skeleton
that
s
still
alive
malaria
did
it
quinine
would
have
stopped
it
those
dirty
little
japs
have
all
the
quinine
trees
in
the
world
and
that
s
one
way
they
hope
to
win
the
world
that
s
how
they
fight
oh
sparky
her
voice
was
hoarse
you
re
always
wonderful
if
that
was
all
we
came
for
it
s
but
it
s
not
it
s
only
the
beginning
there
are
the
boxes
marked
d
we
won
t
know
what
s
in
them
until
we
are
at
the
foot
of
the
himalaya
and
that
we
hope
will
be
the
beginning
of
the
sparky
her
voice
was
tense
i
d
like
to
take
that
quinine
to
you
can
t
not
in
our
ship
this
ship
goes
straight
through
to
i
d
like
to
see
those
fighting
boys
that
would
be
sort
of
a
i
might
be
able
to
fix
it
he
conceded
anyway
i
ll
try
now
you
run
along
and
have
a
good
time
with
your
new
friends
you
ve
got
it
my
best
times
always
come
in
the
hardest
she
was
still
thinking
of
burma
for
all
that
she
left
the
plane
to
join
judy
pierce
in
her
bright
little
sport
car
chapter
xiii
snake
charmer
it
would
really
be
a
shame
to
pass
right
through
india
without
seeing
any
of
it
judy
said
as
they
slid
smoothly
over
a
paved
street
yes
i
suppose
so
mary
agreed
but
business
is
business
we
haven
t
much
time
i
must
always
be
in
touch
with
we
ll
arrange
it
that
way
judy
promised
we
ll
not
be
away
from
the
phone
more
than
an
hour
at
any
that
will
be
swell
you
see
we
have
part
of
a
ship
load
of
quinine
judy
exclaimed
it
s
for
oh
you
are
a
public
benefactor
what
a
wonderful
privilege
to
fly
half
way
round
the
world
to
bring
health
back
to
hundreds
of
our
boys
it
has
its
drawbacks
mary
spoke
slowly
how
do
you
mean
let
me
tell
you
later
just
now
i
d
like
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
do
that
i
ll
say
never
a
for
a
full
half
hour
after
that
they
wound
in
and
out
from
one
gorgeous
scene
to
another
in
a
world
s
paradise
beautiful
residences
set
back
among
tropical
trees
little
gardens
where
oranges
and
lemons
clung
to
branches
like
spheres
of
gold
narrow
arched
bridges
over
which
they
these
delighted
mary
s
eyes
the
people
were
strange
some
were
faultlessly
dressed
europeans
some
mohammedans
and
some
the
slender
hindus
but
all
even
the
children
seemed
bright
and
gay
why
this
is
a
golden
paradise
mary
exclaimed
i
never
dreamed
that
india
could
be
like
this
it
can
t
said
judy
not
all
of
it
in
america
there
are
two
sides
of
the
railroad
track
in
india
there
are
the
two
sides
to
the
river
this
is
the
bright
side
i
ll
show
you
the
other
side
after
tea
you
need
to
see
that
at
dusk
we
ll
have
to
be
getting
back
said
judy
there
may
be
a
phone
call
from
that
man
sparky
it
must
be
great
traveling
with
a
man
like
oh
it
is
you
must
have
lots
of
fun
we
do
on
the
and
the
rest
of
the
time
the
rest
of
the
time
he
s
too
busy
taking
care
of
his
so
he
sends
you
off
alone
to
have
all
the
fun
judy
laughed
but
when
you
ve
reached
the
journey
s
will
we
have
fun
mary
grinned
well
here
we
are
judy
swung
the
car
into
a
drive
before
a
stately
brick
building
this
is
the
school
classes
are
over
and
all
the
teachers
are
waiting
to
have
tea
with
they
walked
up
the
broad
path
that
lay
between
two
rows
of
stately
palms
judy
led
mary
to
her
own
room
that
she
might
wash
and
brush
up
then
hurried
away
to
ask
about
a
phone
call
no
call
yet
she
said
as
she
returned
listen
mary
held
up
a
hand
from
the
sky
came
a
thunder
of
sound
big
planes
a
lot
of
them
come
on
seizing
judy
s
hand
mary
dragged
her
outside
there
looking
up
they
saw
a
large
formation
of
heavy
bombers
all
but
breathless
mary
began
to
count
she
ended
judy
that
s
the
flight
sparky
and
i
started
out
with
we
re
going
to
have
company
over
the
mountains
and
you
re
going
to
need
it
judy
said
soberly
had
mary
consulted
her
own
wishes
she
would
have
hurried
away
to
the
airport
but
courtesy
decreed
that
she
remain
at
judy
s
tea
so
judy
s
tea
it
was
and
not
so
bad
after
all
there
were
teachers
in
the
group
waiting
to
welcome
mary
on
the
large
cool
porch
of
the
teachers
home
some
had
gray
hair
and
some
like
judy
were
young
one
and
all
they
were
eager
to
know
more
about
the
war
and
the
lands
they
had
left
behind
when
tea
had
been
served
and
they
had
chatted
informally
for
a
short
time
they
led
mary
to
a
large
easy
chair
and
bolstered
her
up
with
cushions
now
said
the
dean
you
are
our
queen
we
each
and
every
one
of
us
demand
an
a
queen
for
an
hour
mary
laughed
what
is
it
you
wish
to
know
and
what
is
your
supplication
tell
me
said
a
girl
with
glorious
red
hair
i
have
done
some
flying
oh
quite
a
bit
how
may
i
become
a
waf
and
go
flying
around
the
world
you
probably
can
t
was
the
disturbing
reply
i
it
seems
am
a
person
of
special
privilege
or
perhaps
you
might
say
with
a
dark
curse
upon
my
head
at
least
until
now
i
am
the
only
member
of
our
band
who
has
turned
into
a
world
traveler
but
if
you
are
extremely
she
added
oh
i
am
yes
i
also
came
from
another
corner
and
i
came
again
in
that
case
said
mary
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
get
back
to
very
simple
just
a
little
yes
mary
agreed
but
whether
i
will
make
it
or
how
i
don
t
really
when
you
are
in
america
she
went
on
make
sure
you
have
five
hundred
hours
of
flying
to
your
credit
then
step
right
in
there
are
rather
rigid
examinations
after
that
you
go
through
four
weeks
of
tireless
basic
training
learning
how
to
be
a
soldier
and
all
and
then
you
get
your
wings
the
red
head
suggested
you
might
call
it
that
after
that
you
fly
and
fly
and
fly
delivering
all
manner
of
planes
to
all
sorts
of
places
all
over
and
then
mary
drew
a
long
breath
if
you
ve
been
a
good
girl
and
if
the
gods
are
kind
you
get
a
trip
round
the
world
practically
tell
us
about
this
marvelous
trip
another
girl
said
mary
allowed
herself
a
fleeting
thought
of
all
the
grand
boys
of
the
bombing
flight
waiting
at
the
airport
then
launched
herself
into
the
bright
hilarious
sober
story
of
her
journey
the
crackup
in
the
brazilian
jungle
the
beachcomber
of
brazil
the
jap
spy
the
woman
in
black
the
battle
over
the
desert
with
burt
ramsey
as
hero
the
missing
traveling
bag
of
persia
were
all
there
oh
that
s
how
it
is
the
red
head
gasped
when
mary
had
finished
no
mary
laughed
that
s
how
it
was
once
we
have
delivered
our
plane
and
cargo
i
suspect
that
we
shall
drift
back
to
america
on
flowery
beds
of
ease
and
with
never
an
chapter
xiv
the
cast
assembles
as
she
left
the
cool
shade
of
that
porch
mary
was
thinking
of
just
two
things
her
reunion
with
the
men
of
the
big
bomber
flight
and
their
plans
for
the
immediate
future
one
thing
surprised
her
when
they
had
entered
the
school
an
hour
before
the
sun
had
been
shining
brightly
now
it
was
raining
hard
what
a
change
she
exclaimed
as
she
and
judy
raced
for
the
car
it
s
the
start
of
the
rainy
season
judy
explained
once
they
were
inside
the
car
gliding
along
when
it
starts
it
keeps
right
on
it
s
too
bad
you
didn
t
arrive
a
week
why
at
this
season
of
the
year
terrible
storms
sweep
over
the
himalaya
mountains
you
ve
got
to
cross
them
you
is
it
very
dangerous
they
say
it
s
one
of
the
most
dangerous
passes
in
the
world
once
a
flight
of
five
planes
with
chinese
pilots
started
over
the
pass
not
one
of
them
was
ever
heard
of
again
but
then
judy
hastened
to
add
those
were
small
planes
you
ve
got
a
real
yes
mary
thought
we
ve
got
a
real
for
all
that
she
could
not
help
recalling
the
many
times
real
ships
big
passenger
planes
had
crashed
against
the
stone
wall
of
the
rockies
the
himalayas
are
much
higher
than
the
rockies
she
said
oh
much
higher
one
peak
has
never
been
scaled
it
s
been
tried
time
and
again
many
a
poor
climber
is
buried
beneath
their
mary
scarcely
heard
this
last
remark
for
the
airport
loomed
just
ahead
having
bidden
judy
with
a
promise
to
join
her
again
in
an
hour
she
found
herself
in
the
midst
of
a
veritable
mob
of
airmen
who
in
their
joy
at
seeing
her
threatened
to
wreck
her
precious
flying
hands
squeezed
the
life
out
of
her
and
talked
her
deaf
and
dumb
all
in
the
same
five
minutes
after
that
order
was
restored
and
they
led
her
to
a
back
room
there
they
set
her
on
a
stool
to
join
her
in
a
toast
to
the
god
of
the
himalayas
and
the
future
drunk
with
american
coffee
by
the
time
she
managed
to
drag
sparky
into
a
corner
for
a
private
conference
she
was
quite
out
of
breath
illustration
cornered
sparky
for
a
private
sparky
she
spoke
in
a
low
tone
as
the
crooks
would
say
what
s
the
lay
we
ll
be
here
for
at
least
another
sparky
s
brow
wrinkled
i
don
t
like
it
the
rainy
season
is
here
every
day
it
will
get
worse
we
ve
made
it
this
far
alone
and
considering
the
circumstances
got
on
pretty
sure
we
have
but
orders
are
orders
sparky
sighed
we
re
to
go
over
with
the
rest
of
the
that
s
so
they
ll
pull
us
off
a
mountain
peak
in
case
we
get
stuck
mary
suggested
something
like
that
that
s
the
toughest
bit
of
flying
in
the
whole
trip
so
everything
has
to
be
a
little
more
than
all
right
our
ship
is
ready
to
go
right
thanks
to
sparky
s
endless
hours
of
sparky
grinned
have
it
any
way
you
like
the
other
planes
are
not
ready
won
t
be
for
a
day
what
about
the
quinine
mary
asked
eagerly
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
that
there
s
time
to
get
over
to
the
burma
line
and
back
before
we
oh
sparky
her
eyes
shone
but
not
with
our
plane
he
went
on
it
s
too
risky
the
balance
of
our
cargo
is
the
most
important
part
our
ship
must
be
in
first
class
shape
for
that
last
but
can
t
we
borrow
a
smaller
plane
for
the
burma
trip
well
we
might
sparky
spoke
slowly
thing
is
i
hate
to
leave
our
ship
and
its
cargo
for
a
single
hour
you
know
all
the
things
that
have
yes
sparky
i
her
voice
was
husky
we
ve
had
a
lot
of
luck
he
hesitated
tell
you
what
you
show
up
here
just
before
dawn
tomorrow
and
we
ll
see
what
can
be
cooked
i
ll
be
here
sparky
and
now
look
there
s
my
car
waiting
for
you
ve
made
some
swell
i
sure
have
see
you
in
the
she
went
racing
away
you
look
tired
said
judy
when
they
were
once
again
headed
for
the
school
how
would
you
like
to
take
a
nap
in
my
room
for
a
couple
of
hours
that
will
be
just
swell
said
mary
by
that
time
it
will
be
early
twilight
just
the
right
time
to
visit
the
other
side
of
the
oh
yes
the
other
side
of
the
it
s
quite
different
i
assure
you
when
i
am
in
a
strange
little
world
i
ve
never
seen
before
i
like
to
see
it
all
not
just
part
of
oh
so
do
well
this
time
you
ll
not
see
it
all
no
one
has
ever
seen
all
of
india
but
you
can
see
the
other
side
of
the
they
arrived
at
the
school
and
soon
with
the
shades
drawn
and
door
locked
mary
was
drifting
off
to
the
land
of
dreams
when
she
was
awakened
it
seemed
she
had
just
fallen
asleep
but
a
dash
of
cold
water
on
her
face
and
a
demitasse
of
very
black
coffee
brought
her
back
to
life
we
ll
do
the
other
side
said
judy
we
ll
not
take
too
long
for
it
then
we
ll
dine
in
one
of
those
strange
little
restaurants
you
may
not
like
the
food
but
you
ll
like
the
setting
the
fruit
is
always
good
and
the
tea
as
you
have
never
before
sounds
all
and
after
after
that
i
d
like
to
run
over
to
the
airport
for
just
a
moment
won
t
take
long
want
to
check
on
some
down
deep
in
her
heart
mary
was
hoping
that
sparky
would
have
things
all
fixed
for
her
trip
to
burma
with
the
quinine
she
really
had
her
heart
set
on
that
trip
to
visit
a
real
battlefield
to
see
the
men
who
for
months
had
been
fighting
in
mud
and
blood
for
victory
that
would
be
like
visiting
another
world
something
she
d
never
forget
and
to
be
able
to
tell
some
of
them
that
she
had
done
a
little
just
a
very
little
to
bring
them
new
health
and
happiness
ah
that
surely
would
bring
a
thrill
she
and
judy
were
crossing
the
bridge
as
she
thought
all
this
arriving
on
the
other
side
she
was
surprised
and
shocked
here
it
is
true
were
the
same
grand
old
palms
the
sweeping
drive
and
all
that
but
the
people
and
their
homes
here
were
dirt
squalor
ragged
children
slinking
dogs
and
shaggy
monkeys
staring
down
at
her
from
the
trees
why
don
t
they
kill
the
monkeys
she
asked
then
there
would
be
more
for
the
people
to
oh
you
can
t
do
that
if
you
killed
just
one
monkey
you
d
be
judy
was
shocked
in
goodness
name
why
the
monkeys
are
sacred
religion
is
a
potent
force
to
these
people
but
don
t
let
s
get
started
on
that
come
on
let
s
judy
hurried
on
each
filled
with
her
own
long
thoughts
they
wandered
on
and
on
as
the
shadows
darkened
the
streets
narrowed
at
last
they
were
in
the
very
heart
of
the
city
look
mary
whispered
suddenly
gripping
judy
s
arm
see
that
tall
woman
in
the
black
dress
yes
a
the
woman
was
moving
across
an
open
space
where
the
afterglow
of
the
sun
brought
her
out
in
bold
relief
does
you
say
there
was
anything
unusual
about
her
these
words
were
said
by
mary
in
so
tense
a
whisper
that
judy
turned
to
look
at
her
why
yes
she
replied
slowly
she
is
strange
i
should
say
that
she
doesn
t
belong
here
at
how
could
you
know
that
mary
asked
in
a
startled
voice
i
teach
art
and
i
paint
quite
a
bit
you
know
an
artist
a
really
good
one
makes
you
conscious
of
a
beautiful
figure
even
though
it
is
loaded
down
with
robes
it
s
the
way
you
sit
and
stand
and
move
that
woman
does
not
belong
here
i
ve
never
seen
anyone
like
her
there
is
a
spring
in
her
step
her
body
is
like
a
tight
wire
i
d
hate
to
meet
her
in
the
dark
just
then
as
if
conscious
of
the
fact
that
she
was
being
talked
about
the
woman
turned
and
looked
back
as
if
startled
she
quickened
her
pace
to
say
that
mary
was
startled
and
alarmed
would
be
to
put
it
very
mildly
she
was
not
dreaming
that
here
in
india
she
had
come
across
the
woman
in
black
and
yet
this
woman
did
seem
to
have
something
in
common
with
her
it
was
strange
come
on
she
whispered
i
want
to
she
did
not
finish
what
did
she
want
to
see
perhaps
she
did
not
know
she
saw
sooner
than
she
wished
the
woman
had
turned
a
corner
as
they
appeared
rounding
that
same
corner
she
made
a
sudden
movement
something
bright
gleamed
in
her
hand
in
the
nick
of
time
mary
dropped
flat
there
was
a
flash
and
a
report
then
a
scream
neither
mary
nor
judy
had
screamed
though
judy
would
have
done
so
had
she
not
lost
her
voice
it
was
that
woman
who
had
screamed
little
wonder
for
a
white
man
darting
from
a
corner
had
knocked
the
gun
from
her
hand
then
had
made
a
grab
for
her
quicker
than
any
cat
she
bent
low
to
escape
his
grasp
then
vanished
into
a
dark
and
narrow
street
after
bending
over
to
pick
up
the
woman
s
pistol
the
man
walked
toward
the
girls
in
long
strides
she
almost
got
you
that
time
miss
he
spoke
gruffly
now
what
would
nice
girls
like
you
be
doing
in
such
a
place
as
this
and
one
of
you
in
uniform
say
his
tone
changed
you
don
t
happen
to
be
the
young
lady
who
helped
bring
that
quinine
from
america
that
s
who
i
am
mary
admitted
say
you
re
a
real
hero
shake
he
gripped
her
hand
until
it
hurt
here
he
said
take
this
gun
you
may
need
he
held
out
the
pistol
mary
dropped
it
into
her
pocket
what
d
she
shoot
at
you
for
he
demanded
it
s
a
long
mary
hesitated
at
least
i
think
it
oh
it
is
then
let
s
get
out
of
here
she
might
come
with
long
swinging
strides
he
led
the
way
out
of
the
narrow
labyrinth
of
streets
what
were
you
doing
back
there
mary
asked
as
they
neared
the
river
me
he
laughed
hoarsely
that
s
a
good
one
me
i
m
a
flying
tiger
nobody
ever
touches
a
flying
tiger
they
don
t
dare
a
flying
tiger
mary
was
thrilled
judy
nodded
her
confirmation
then
she
whispered
that
s
what
he
is
and
one
of
the
best
you
d
be
honorin
me
if
you
d
have
a
bite
to
eat
with
me
said
mary
s
friend
both
of
you
i
m
scottie
burns
and
i
m
with
an
american
squadron
it
will
be
a
pleasure
mary
said
and
i
m
yes
yes
judy
hastened
to
add
it
will
be
a
real
and
will
you
name
the
place
scottie
begged
i
m
not
so
well
acquainted
judy
led
them
to
a
quiet
place
run
by
a
native
indian
chef
who
had
spent
several
years
in
america
and
who
knew
how
to
prepare
indian
food
as
americans
liked
it
it
was
a
jolly
and
delightful
occasion
after
some
urging
scottie
told
with
laughter
and
tears
of
his
experiences
with
the
flying
tigers
illustration
nobody
dares
touch
a
flying
tiger
that
s
one
spell
in
my
life
i
ll
never
forget
he
concluded
never
never
it
was
tough
but
it
was
glorious
when
the
last
battle
is
won
and
the
last
man
of
that
brave
band
is
laid
away
like
a
tattered
flag
for
keeps
we
ll
be
and
in
that
place
where
all
good
indians
go
and
now
he
turned
to
mary
how
about
this
lady
who
wishes
you
were
dead
oh
it
s
nothing
at
all
after
what
you
ve
been
telling
but
i
ll
tell
you
all
the
mary
told
the
story
of
her
journey
while
scottie
listened
with
rapt
attention
young
lady
he
exclaimed
when
she
had
finished
you
ve
got
what
it
takes
i
m
only
one
of
the
thousands
of
american
women
who
have
joined
up
to
help
win
the
war
said
mary
and
they
ve
all
got
what
it
glory
be
for
that
scottie
exclaimed
now
i
know
the
fight
will
soon
be
over
when
the
ladies
get
into
hitler
s
hair
there
s
nothing
left
but
the
shouting
and
here
s
a
he
leaned
forward
and
his
eyes
shone
there
is
talk
of
sending
me
to
burma
with
that
quinine
early
oh
judy
exclaimed
that
wouldn
t
be
fair
mary
and
sparky
should
do
it
they
ve
earned
the
exactly
what
i
said
scottie
agreed
but
sparky
won
t
risk
his
ship
and
he
won
t
leave
the
rest
of
his
cargo
alone
for
an
hour
and
as
for
this
young
he
hesitated
embarrassed
of
course
it
wouldn
t
be
safe
mary
stepped
in
i
don
t
know
the
route
the
quinine
is
too
precious
i
wouldn
t
think
of
risking
of
course
not
judy
smiled
but
if
scottie
were
sent
with
it
and
if
he
were
to
ask
that
you
be
sent
along
as
his
oh
i
d
accept
you
would
scottie
exclaimed
then
what
s
keeping
us
only
sparky
s
okay
and
orders
from
headquarters
i
ll
get
it
all
fixed
within
the
hour
where
s
my
hat
yes
waiter
waiter
bring
the
checks
with
the
least
possible
ceremony
and
no
apology
scottie
paid
the
charge
and
bounded
from
the
room
a
flying
tiger
judy
exclaimed
he
flies
even
when
he
s
on
the
all
the
same
i
like
him
a
mary
s
eyes
shone
who
wouldn
t
i
envy
you
that
will
be
something
to
everything
we
do
is
something
to
remember
said
mary
that
s
why
i
like
if
i
had
the
flying
hours
i
d
resign
tomorrow
and
join
the
you
can
get
the
necessary
training
at
the
woman
s
flying
training
detachment
said
mary
jacqueline
cochrane
is
the
i
ll
think
about
it
judy
replied
soberly
they
left
the
place
to
wander
slowly
back
toward
the
school
as
they
crossed
the
long
bridge
the
dark
waters
of
the
river
sweeping
beneath
them
seemed
to
whisper
of
the
thousands
who
had
swarmed
its
banks
since
time
began
do
you
know
said
mary
i
am
obsessed
with
a
strange
notion
that
this
woman
who
shot
at
me
tonight
is
a
french
woman
i
saw
at
the
port
we
reached
after
we
had
flown
the
in
north
africa
judy
exclaimed
that
s
yes
i
suppose
so
but
i
seem
to
have
been
haunted
by
women
in
black
all
the
that
s
possible
and
it
is
also
possible
that
they
were
all
but
they
were
all
so
very
much
alike
mary
insisted
that
said
judy
is
even
probable
i
have
a
friend
here
in
india
who
is
a
he
told
me
once
that
women
spies
were
all
very
much
alike
that
is
the
successful
ones
were
they
are
smart
he
says
keen
in
their
own
way
usually
well
educated
and
all
that
their
smartness
is
like
the
smartness
of
a
dagger
if
you
can
say
a
dagger
is
judy
paused
to
reflect
smart
as
a
dagger
mary
murmured
that
does
sound
a
little
smart
and
beautiful
said
judy
i
have
a
friend
who
has
a
collection
of
what
he
calls
beautiful
they
beautiful
too
hilts
of
gold
some
with
pearls
set
in
silver
handles
and
a
lot
more
but
they
all
have
one
thing
in
common
an
ugly
dangerous
blade
women
spies
are
alike
i
suppose
in
very
much
the
same
way
that
s
why
this
one
seems
like
the
probably
so
mary
agreed
but
say
i
d
like
to
go
over
and
see
sparky
before
we
go
to
bed
he
might
have
something
more
to
tell
i
ll
drive
you
over
judy
volunteered
it
s
all
fixed
mary
were
sparky
s
first
words
to
her
when
she
reached
the
airport
that
flying
tiger
scottie
will
fly
with
you
to
burma
first
thing
in
the
scottie
s
a
fast
mary
was
pleased
he
sure
is
and
a
good
one
they
say
he
s
downed
more
japs
than
anyone
in
china
and
he
s
barely
years
old
she
stared
that
s
right
they
grow
old
fast
over
here
but
he
ll
turn
young
again
when
this
is
sparky
her
voice
dropped
if
i
shouldn
t
come
back
you
can
get
a
good
to
go
with
you
on
that
last
lap
to
our
journey
s
oh
sure
but
you
ll
come
back
mary
if
i
wasn
t
dead
certain
of
that
i
d
never
let
you
oh
so
that
s
the
way
it
is
mary
laughed
you
bet
your
life
it
is
we
re
going
to
finish
this
thing
you
and
i
but
i
want
you
to
go
with
scottie
he
added
you
ve
had
a
lot
of
grief
on
this
trip
i
want
you
to
see
just
how
worthwhile
it
thanks
her
voice
went
husky
their
hands
met
in
a
good
stout
grip
a
half
hour
later
mary
crept
between
cool
white
sheets
in
the
teachers
home
at
the
school
prepared
for
a
good
sleep
before
the
dawn
of
one
more
big
day
chapter
xv
burma
detour
when
mary
arrived
at
the
airport
before
dawn
next
morning
guards
like
gray
ghosts
were
moving
silently
about
among
the
many
planes
assembled
there
having
been
challenged
by
one
of
the
guards
she
explained
her
mission
and
was
at
once
led
to
a
cabin
monoplane
that
was
just
warming
up
oh
there
you
are
scottie
exclaimed
i
hope
you
re
ready
for
a
bit
of
a
scrap
or
anything
that
comes
i
m
with
you
for
anything
that
comes
our
way
she
replied
good
said
scottie
well
then
let
s
get
up
and
get
climbing
to
his
place
he
released
the
mechanic
who
had
put
his
plane
in
motion
then
motioned
mary
to
the
s
seat
this
is
a
small
plane
alongside
yours
he
said
we
had
to
break
up
some
of
the
boxes
of
quinine
and
store
the
goods
in
the
wings
but
it
s
all
there
listen
to
her
he
exclaimed
as
the
motor
roared
snortin
to
go
she
s
the
sweetest
ship
i
ve
ever
flown
she
ll
jump
right
straight
up
from
the
ground
or
nearly
so
and
can
land
on
any
road
a
car
can
run
on
she
can
do
four
hundred
miles
an
hour
flying
straight
on
and
can
cut
circles
around
any
jap
plane
that
s
made
i
only
wish
i
could
show
you
what
a
fighter
she
is
but
they
say
all
s
quiet
on
the
burma
please
don
t
stir
it
up
on
my
mary
laughed
a
bit
nervously
all
i
m
interested
in
is
getting
that
quinine
to
the
sure
scottie
agreed
heartily
that
s
our
mission
and
that
s
what
we
ll
do
but
downing
a
couple
of
zeros
won
t
hurt
a
it
seemed
to
mary
as
they
rose
to
greet
the
dawn
that
he
had
spoken
the
exact
truth
his
ship
did
appear
to
leap
straight
into
the
air
like
a
frightened
bird
i
m
glad
sparky
is
getting
a
chance
to
have
a
real
rest
at
last
she
said
after
a
time
yes
i
imagine
he
can
use
it
all
right
said
scottie
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
sleep
late
after
that
he
and
one
of
the
boys
at
camp
will
fly
your
plane
to
the
foot
of
the
mountains
we
ll
meet
them
there
late
and
tomorrow
we
ll
go
over
the
himalayas
mary
drew
in
a
long
deep
breath
yes
providing
the
mountain
gods
permit
you
they
don
t
always
not
by
a
long
is
it
really
bad
it
s
the
toughest
bit
of
flying
between
china
and
chicago
every
pilot
who
s
done
the
trip
says
so
and
there
s
a
score
or
more
of
men
who
ve
flown
it
many
times
help
is
coming
to
china
from
america
in
a
big
plane
and
i
m
so
are
we
all
mary
agreed
for
an
hour
they
sailed
on
over
green
fields
of
rice
and
dark
tangled
forests
there
s
a
storm
gathering
over
there
scottie
nodded
in
the
direction
they
were
going
hope
we
can
beat
oh
i
hope
they
were
over
a
broad
stretch
of
water
now
it
s
getting
really
black
over
the
jungle
where
those
jap
rats
are
scottie
set
his
motor
roaring
they
ll
not
bother
us
as
mary
watched
the
gathering
storm
she
thought
she
saw
small
planes
like
birds
circling
before
the
clouds
scurrying
home
she
told
herself
they
had
reached
the
far
side
of
the
water
when
with
startling
suddenness
the
storm
struck
catching
their
plane
as
if
it
were
a
wisp
of
paper
the
wind
whirled
it
a
thousand
two
three
thousand
feet
then
sent
it
whirling
down
again
just
hold
your
seat
scottie
s
lips
were
drawn
into
a
straight
line
i
ve
been
all
through
this
when
their
downward
rush
had
slackened
he
kept
the
plane
headed
toward
the
earth
we
re
still
at
five
thousand
feet
he
murmured
might
be
a
bright
spot
all
the
time
mary
was
thinking
we
ve
come
all
that
long
way
with
the
quinine
and
suddenly
she
let
out
a
little
cry
of
joy
from
the
very
blackness
of
night
that
was
the
heart
of
a
storm
cloud
they
leaped
into
clear
bright
air
better
still
beneath
them
lay
a
large
clearing
and
at
its
far
end
half
hidden
was
a
small
airfield
scottie
spoke
a
few
words
into
his
radio
mary
caught
the
answer
come
on
down
you
monkey
what
you
want
to
do
stay
up
there
and
get
wet
roaring
with
laughter
scottie
set
the
plane
circling
down
the
next
minute
their
plane
and
they
slid
in
for
a
stop
here
we
are
scottie
exclaimed
yes
and
here
comes
the
rain
was
mary
s
answer
as
big
drops
began
beating
a
tattoo
on
their
fuselage
three
minutes
later
while
the
rain
was
coming
down
in
torrents
a
laughing
young
doughboy
carrying
slickers
on
his
arm
climbed
to
the
plane
s
cabin
to
thrust
in
his
head
for
a
look
i
win
he
shouted
to
someone
standing
in
a
tent
door
you
lose
your
two
bucks
she
s
a
lady
and
boy
oh
boy
is
she
there
came
a
roar
from
the
distant
tent
then
the
boy
crowded
past
the
boxes
of
quinine
to
hold
out
the
slickers
here
get
into
these
he
urged
we
heard
about
your
coming
and
about
the
quinine
you
won
t
be
here
long
got
ta
make
every
moment
smiling
happily
mary
hid
herself
in
a
slicker
six
sizes
too
big
then
raced
away
to
the
tent
where
she
found
a
score
of
young
men
most
of
them
with
full
beards
singing
it
ain
t
going
to
rain
no
the
instant
she
appeared
the
song
broke
off
short
here
she
is
danny
her
escort
shouted
now
where
s
the
two
you
got
ta
take
that
raincoat
off
her
before
i
m
convinced
came
the
defiant
reply
with
a
happy
smile
mary
threw
aside
her
raincoat
there
came
a
succession
of
low
gasps
then
whispers
it
is
it
s
a
gal
at
that
a
tall
doughboy
shuffled
forward
we
drew
straws
he
began
bashfully
i
lost
so
i
ve
got
to
make
you
a
speech
all
want
to
thank
you
for
the
quinine

and

drenching
rain
carried
her
away
to
the
hospital
there
safely
hidden
away
at
the
edge
of
the
jungle
they
put
her
down
in
a
big
tent
packed
full
of
cots
and
on
every
cot
rested

invalid
soldier

messages
of
the
sick
men
then
scottie
came
in
i

sparky
s
of
course
she
exclaimed
we
must
get
a
roar
of
farewell
from
the
soldiers
a
half
hour
later
a
burst
of
speed
and
once
again
they
were
in
the
air
for
some
time
they
were
silent
then
mary
said
in
a
solemn
voice
scottie
i
saw
things
in
that
field
hospital
today
that
i
hope
i
may
never
see
again
but
i
ll
never
forget
them
never
never
yes
i
know
scottie
replied
there
was
another
long
silence
then
scottie
spoke
i
don
t
often
speak
of
it
war
s
not
a
thing
to
be
talked
about
really
especially
when
you
re
talking
to
a
girl
but
did
you
happen
to
notice
those
two
boys
in
the
far
corner
of
the
hospital
yes
i
talked
to
them
such
nice
boys
both
college
men
they
were
yes
and
were
is
exactly
the
word
neither
of
them
will
ever
fly
again
and
one
will
never
even
terrible
she
murmured
it
is
scottie
s
voice
rose
they
were
my
buddies
those
boys
were
more
than
once
we
flew
in
the
same
formation
we
were
together
when
it
happened
want
me
to
tell
you
he
hesitated
yes
tell
her
voice
was
low
well
those
boys
were
flying
a
two
seater
one
was
pilot
the
other
radioman
and
gunner
we
were
four
planes
together
on
patrol
ten
zeros
dropped
down
upon
us
from
the
oh
the
clouds
mary
looked
up
large
white
clouds
left
by
the
storm
were
hovering
above
them
it
was
a
hot
fight
scottie
went
on
i
got
me
two
zeros
sent
them
down
in
flames
having
one
more
burst
of
fire
i
went
after
one
more
zero
he
was
a
tough
one
got
in
a
burst
of
slugs
on
me
and
cut
half
my
ship
s
tail
away
but
i
gave
him
one
that
set
one
of
his
wings
shaking
like
a
dead
leaf
with
my
guns
empty
i
was
heading
for
home
and
wondering
if
i
d
get
there
when
i
saw
a
good
american
going
down
in
flames
it
s
the
end
of
those
boys
i
thought
then
i
saw
two
parachutes
blossom
did
they
make
it
they
would
scottie
hesitated
you
might
not
believe
me
but
those
boys
would
tell
you
if
you
asked
why
the
jap
that
shot
them
down
followed
them
followed
until
their
parachutes
opened
up
shot
them
that
s
what
he
did
me
i
was
so
mad
i
went
after
him
and
without
ammunition
and
with
a
tail
i
d
have
got
him
too
if
i
d
had
to
ram
him
but
he
hid
in
a
and
didn
t
anyone
get
him
mary
asked
eagerly
not
that
day
they
didn
t
nor
ever
i
guess
we
d
know
his
plane
if
we
got
him
and
i
d
know
him
in
the
how
could
you
the
impudent
monkey
had
the
nose
of
his
plane
painted
to
represent
our
uncle
sam
with
a
long
beard
and
a
very
red
giving
you
something
to
shoot
at
i
let
me
see
the
target
just
one
more
time
scottie
exclaimed
and
i
ll
make
a
bull
s
for
a
long
time
after
that
mary
sat
staring
dreamily
down
at
the
tropical
beauty
that
glided
beneath
them
and
thinking
of
the
people
who
like
bits
of
the
jungle
had
come
and
gone
in
her
life
during
the
days
that
had
just
passed
she
saw
again
jerry
the
beachcomber
the
woman
in
black
captain
ramsey
and
her
father
a
dozen
other
familiar
figures
passed
before
her
mind
s
eye
and
then
of
a
sudden
scottie
exclaimed
look
there
s
four
of
those
little
slipping
out
of
a
cloud
right
now
i
don
t
he
hesitated
of
course
we
can
run
or
we
can
climb
they
d
never
come
near
us
perhaps
that
s
the
best
way
there
s
sparky
waiting
for
you
and
your
there
was
a
wistful
note
in
his
voice
it
was
mary
thought
like
the
singing
note
of
a
faithful
dog
s
whine
when
he
was
begging
to
be
loosened
for
a
fight
sparky
can
wait
if
need
her
voice
was
firm
the
cargo
will
go
through
even
if
i
m
not
then
go
get
them
scottie
her
words
came
short
and
quick
you
asked
for
his
motor
roared
so
did
the
four
zeros
sure
that
one
of
them
would
finish
scottie
off
came
right
at
them
as
if
by
thundering
straight
on
he
hoped
to
avoid
them
scottie
did
not
change
his
course
until
he
was
almost
beneath
them
then
with
a
hang
on
mary
he
tilted
his
plane
straight
up
to
climb
toward
the
stars
caught
off
guard
the
attackers
attempted
to
scatter
one
narrowly
escaped
crashing
into
the
other
and
in
the
confusion
found
scottie
beneath
him
with
every
gun
blazing
with
its
fuselage
sawed
half
in
two
the
zero
doubled
up
to
go
rolling
and
tumbling
toward
the
jungle
far
below
just
in
time
scottie
dropped
the
nose
of
his
plane
tilted
and
went
into
a
spiral
to
escape
an
enemy
on
his
tail
when
he
came
out
of
the
spiral
he
stood
for
a
second
on
his
wing
then
rising
like
a
comet
flashed
past
the
attacker
to
catch
a
second
zero
unawares
and
send
him
down
in
a
pillar
of
smoke
just
then
a
stream
of
slugs
cut
across
their
cabin
so
close
to
their
backs
that
mary
felt
the
heat
of
their
passing
the
scottie
did
not
finish
as
the
other
plane
flashed
past
him
he
had
seen
something
mary
had
seen
it
too
get
him
scottie
she
screamed
get
him
if
it
s
the
last
thing
you
ever
never
doubt
it
in
deathly
fear
lest
his
ship
had
suffered
from
the
attackers
bullets
he
set
his
motor
thundering
her
best
as
he
set
himself
to
beat
the
zero
to
a
cloud
a
mile
or
so
away
they
gained
they
halved
the
distance
between
them
they
quartered
it
the
plane
seemed
a
thing
alive
get
him
scottie
get
him
she
cried
hoarsely
it
was
a
long
chance
but
just
as
the
enemy
touched
the
edge
of
the
cloud
scottie
let
go
a
burst
of
fire
another
then
another
the
zero
had
completely
disappeared
when
the
last
burst
roared
from
his
guns
ten
seconds
passed
twenty
thirty
then
down
from
the
cloud
as
if
the
cloud
itself
were
falling
apart
came
broken
bits
of
something
that
once
had
been
a
zero
fighter
just
blasted
him
apart
scottie
muttered
can
you
beat
that
that
picture
of
uncle
sam
on
his
plane
s
that
mary
that
picture
scottie
laughed
hoarsely
that
s
blasted
into
bits
his
engine
must
have
blown
up
or
his
gas
tank
or
both
a
half
hour
later
as
they
circled
for
a
landing
over
the
field
where
sparky
awaited
them
scottie
said
what
s
the
use
of
a
good
american
flier
being
over
burma
without
doing
a
little
fighting
even
if
she
is
a
lady
fighting
scottie
said
mary

t
been
fighting

a
ride

and

the
meantime
with
a
borrowed
sparky
had
made
his
way
to
a
hidden
airbase
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
since
the
had
made
the
flight
several
times
before
the
trip
was
accomplished
without
mishap
or
adventure
the
moment
they
landed
a
chinese
boy
hopping
along
on
one
leg
and
a
crutch
came
out
to
greet
them
and
guide
them
back
into
the
bush
where
living
quarters
had
been
established
oh
he
exclaimed
after
looking
into
the
cabin
somebody
say

flier

t

were
not
mistaken

the
boy
mebby
bomb
maybe
yes
maybe
no
sparky
said
after
looking
the
plane
over
carefully
then
locking
it
up
tight
they
made
a
dash
through
the
pelting
rain
where
a
warm
welcome
and
a
good
american
dinner
awaited
them
when
mary
and
scottie
came
zooming
down
on
the
hidden
airfield
they
found
sparky
waiting
for
them
in
a
jeep
he
whisked
them
away
to
a
little
eating
place
where
they
had
coffee
and
sandwiches
and
where
sparky
listened
to
their
rather
amazing
story
i
wish
i
had
been
with
you
when
you
visited
that
hospital
sparky
said
when
the
story
was
told
oh
i
wish
you
could
have
been
mary
exclaimed
with
real
feeling
it
was
sad
but
just
wonderful
i
d
go
around
the
world
three
times
just
to
do
that
much
for
our
fine
boys
who
seem
to
feel
that
they
are
sort
of
forgotten
over
you
took
a
long
chance
sparky
said
to
scottie
when
we
went
for
that
jap
after
our
plane
had
been
shot
up
scottie
spoke
slowly
yes
that
s
right
we
did
but
if
you
had
seen
that
jap
in
his
plane
with
uncle
sam
s
face
painted
where
it
was
and
you
knew
what
that
rat
of
a
monkey
had
done
that
s
right
sparky
grinned
i
d
have
gone
after
of
course
you
would
mary
agreed
any
real
man
would
have
done
just
that
there
are
some
things
in
this
war
that
can
be
passed
up
others
are
on
the
list
and
that
was
one
of
them
but
sparky
she
leaned
forward
eagerly
what
comes
next
when
do
we
cross
the
mountains
tomorrow
morning
if
the
mountain
storm
gods
permit
was
his
reply
this
afternoon
however
i
have
a
little
trip
to
he
turned
to
scottie
do
you
know
the
road
to
a
town
called
gonagona
he
asked
very
well
said
scottie
i
ve
been
there
several
there
s
an
officer
over
there
with
secret
orders
for
us
sparky
explained
it
has
something
to
do
with
our
landing
place
once
we
are
over
the
mountains
i
must
get
over
there
will
you
drive
me
oh
sure
scottie
grinned
we
ll
leave
mary
in
charge
of
the
plane
said
sparky
think
you
can
manage
that
what
am
i
to
guard
it
from
in
this
wild
place
mary
asked
the
monkeys
of
the
snows
or
something
you
never
can
tell
sparky
did
not
smile
and
by
the
way
there
s
a
chinese
boy
who
will
help
you
out
in
a
pinch
he
has
a
gun
that
someone
loaned
him
it
s
a
businesslike
affair
and
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
he
could
shoot
it
he
s
looking
for
a
zero
plane
perhaps
you
can
find
one
for
him
he
calls
himself
hop
sing
sometimes
he
hops
and
sometimes
he
he
sounds
interesting
said
mary
please
tell
him
to
come
a
half
hour
later
sparky
and
scottie
motored
away
leaving
mary
seated
on
a
fallen
palm
tree
at
the
edge
of
the
narrow
airfield
mary
dreamed
of
many
things
of
wide
black
waters
sifting
desert
sands
glorious
dances
in
egypt
persian
gardens
and
many
more
but
suddenly
she
was
startled
from
her
dreaming
by
a
voice
saying
you
are
the
so
beautiful
flying
lady
and
i
am
hop
sing
me
i
got
machine
gun
many
times
aiming
the
gun
at
a
tree
the
chinese
boy
seemed
about
to
mow
it
down
but
instead
merely
clicked
his
gun
can
shoot
very
well
come
zero
plane
flying
very
low
i
show
you
i
m
glad
to
see
you
hop
she
slid
down
from
her
log
you
ll
protect
me
from
the
monkeys
won
t
you
she
added
with
a
laugh
monkeys
not
hurt
white
lady
was
his
laughing
reply
only
monkeys
wearing
glasses
they
hurt
white
lady
but
hurt
white
lady
me
i
shoot
them
them
shoot
mary
took
to
hop
sing
at
once
she
enjoyed
his
happy
chatter
he
told
her
many
amusing
stories
of
the
war
how
his
people
had
learned
to
trick
the
japs
and
lead
them
away
from
their
goals
how
they
had
hidden
their
food
to
return
for
it
and
so
save
their
own
lives
he
told
her
too
of
things
that
made
her
blood
run
cold
how
can
you
be
so
happy
when
such
terrible
things
are
going
on
she
asked
no
happy
dead
that
s
all
was
his
way
of
saying
that
happiness
come
what
may
is
a
human
necessity
after
a
time
hop
sing
wandered
away
taking
a
seat
on
the
plane
s
right
wing
mary
sat
dreaming
in
the
bright
tropical
sunlight
until
with
startling
suddenness
a
powerful
plane
appearing
to
come
from
nowhere
circled
once
then
swept
down
upon
the
field
the
plane
came
to
a
halt
not
thirty
paces
from
where
she
sat
immediately
four
big
men
in
officers
uniforms
leaped
from
the
plane
illustration
powerful
plane
swept
down
upon
the
this
the
plane
that
arrived
today
from
calcutta
the
younger
of
the
four
pointed
at
sparky
s
plane
i
wouldn
t
there
was
something
about
these
men
that
mary
didn
t
like
she
was
thinking
what
s
this
where
is
this
plane
s
pilot
the
man
demanded
i
don
t
see
here
the
man
took
a
step
forward
we
just
came
over
the
mountains
from
china
we
were
sent
to
pick
up
the
cargo
of
that
it
is
imperative
that
we
have
it
at
an
older
man
took
up
the
story
mary
did
not
like
his
accent
he
certainly
did
not
come
from
america
there
has
been
far
too
much
delay
the
man
went
on
bah
a
woman
for
a
what
can
you
expect
we
are
to
take
off
that
cargo
at
once
said
the
younger
man
and
fly
it
to
china
the
other
added
mary
who
had
been
studying
their
plane
made
no
reply
well
the
younger
man
took
a
step
forward
mary
backed
away
then
stood
her
ground
a
great
silence
had
fallen
over
the
jungle
from
far
away
came
the
scream
of
a
parrot
mary
s
words
scarcely
broke
the
silence
i
have
orders
to
guard
this
plane
until
the
man
who
flies
it
returns
he
ll
be
back
in
a
half
hour
if
you
ve
come
from
china
you
might
like
a
cup
of
preposterous
the
older
man
s
face
purpled
the
younger
man
took
another
step
forward
but
this
time
mary
did
not
retreat
she
just
stood
there
looking
him
squarely
in
the
eye
as
she
said
why
so
preposterous
what
does
this
mean
your
swooping
down
like
this
i
haven
t
been
long
in
the
orient
and
i
m
only
a
girl
but
all
this
seems
strange
and
irregular
the
older
man
stormed
you
can
t
run
a
war
in
this
country
in
what
you
call
a
regular
way
you
must
sometimes
act
in
a
hurry
china
can
not
wait
so
please
step
i
am
remaining
where
i
am
she
declared
stoutly
anyway
i
don
t
have
the
key
to
the
plane
i
may
be
right
then
again
i
may
be
wrong
if
i
am
wrong
i
may
lose
my
wings
but
you
ll
have
to
come
and
take
me
if
you
want
the
cargo
of
this
outwardly
mary
was
calm
but
inside
she
was
all
atremble
the
younger
man
s
lips
twitched
such
stupidity
he
muttered
as
his
hand
slipped
toward
a
something
that
showed
black
beneath
his
belt
mary
trembled
but
did
not
move
at
that
instant
there
came
a
sound
from
behind
the
plane
who
can
that
be
mary
asked
herself
her
heart
gave
a
great
leap
as
she
heard
a
thin
voice
say
i
got
me
a
tommy
gun
i
can
shoot
him
very
good
wan
na
see
before
mary
could
stop
him
hop
sing
sent
out
a
burst
of
fire
that
burned
the
air
above
the
four
men
s
heads
you
little
chinese
rat
the
older
man
stormed
he
broke
off
short
the
gleam
in
hop
sing
s
eyes
at
that
moment
was
a
terrible
thing
to
see
hop
sing
s
burst
of
gunfire
following
as
it
did
the
arrival
of
an
unidentified
airplane
brought
a
score
of
officers
soldiers
and
mechanics
rushing
to
the
scene
what
s
all
this
captain
noble
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
field
demanded
well
sir
said
mary
forgetting
to
salute
these
men
say
they
re
from
china
they
say
they
have
orders
to
take
the
cargo
from
sparky
s
let
s
see
your
orders
the
captain
said
turning
to
the
four
men
certainly
the
younger
of
the
four
drew
a
sheath
of
papers
from
his
pocket
here
they
are
he
shot
mary
an
ugly
look
oh
boy
mary
thought
if
i
m
wrong
i
ll
be
washed
out
of
this
man
s
army
just
like
hm
said
the
captain
papers
seem
all
in
order
suppose
you
d
like
a
cup
of
coffee
before
you
start
back
there
s
not
much
the
younger
man
frowned
time
enough
for
a
cup
of
the
captain
s
smile
was
disarming
are
you
guarding
the
plane
he
asked
mary
yes
and
hop
she
nodded
toward
the
chinese
boy
unlock
the
cabin
and
start
unloading
the
cargo
these
boys
will
help
the
captain
nodded
to
the
group
of
mechanics
mary
s
heart
sank
then
she
remembered
something
the
cabin
s
locked
she
said
quietly
sparky
has
the
where
is
sparky
oh
yes
he
went
to
see
the
major
i
m
afraid
we
can
t
do
a
thing
until
the
pilot
the
captain
smiled
once
again
break
the
lock
the
older
man
snarled
you
know
that
can
not
be
the
captain
did
not
smile
at
a
slight
nod
from
the
younger
men
the
four
moved
toward
the
plane
that
had
brought
them
oddly
enough
with
just
no
orders
at
all
but
with
guns
ready
for
action
the
soldiers
of
the
captain
s
squad
lined
up
in
front
of
that
plane
i
think
the
younger
of
the
four
licked
his
lips
we
ll
accept
your
offer
of
ten
minutes
later
when
sparky
returned
he
went
at
once
into
a
huddle
with
the
captain
a
half
hour
later
the
four
men
returned
to
their
plane
but
four
armed
doughboys
went
there
with
them
the
captain
and
a
took
charge
of
the
plane
mary
you
re
a
wonder
sparky
exclaimed
as
that
plane
climbed
the
sky
who
are
they
she
asked
in
a
whisper
that
said
sparky
is
a
military
where
are
they
going
she
asked
i
don
t
exactly
sparky
smiled
one
thing
i
m
sure
of
and
that
is
they
won
t
come
one
thing
still
puzzles
me
said
mary
what
s
that
sparky
asked
why
did
the
captain
order
me
to
open
the
plane
s
cabin
door
for
those
men
perhaps
he
knew
you
didn
t
have
the
key
then
again
he
may
have
known
you
wouldn
t
use
it
if
you
did
have
it
either
way
he
was
right
what
he
wanted
was
to
avoid
any
shooting
and
he
got
that
i
wouldn
t
trade
you
and
hop
sing
for
four
lieutenant
colonels
and
a
general
sparky
laughed
and
you
re
both
going
with
us
to
that
said
mary
will
be
swell
later
that
day
when
they
were
together
once
more
sparky
and
mary
lingered
long
over
their
tea
in
a
little
place
run
by
a
friend
of
hop
sing
when
mary
had
told
her
story
all
over
again
sparky
s
admiration
for
his
was
greater
than
ever
before
listen
she
held
up
her
hand
the
air
was
filled
with
sound
the
bombers
are
here
he
said
and
that
that
we
go
over
the
mountains
tomorrow
providing
the
storm
gods
chapter
xvii
in
swift
pursuit
that
night
lying
on
a
cot
in
a
tent
shared
with
three
red
cross
nurses
mary
did
not
fall
asleep
at
once
the
day
had
been
a
tremendous
one
much
that
war
means
had
come
crashing
in
upon
her
at
the
field
hospital
she
had
seen
what
war
could
do
to
fine
american
boys
she
had
not
known
that
she
could
feel
so
terribly
sad
and
yet
keep
on
smiling
as
she
had
done
as
she
moved
from
cot
to
cot
on
the
other
hand
she
had
never
been
quite
so
happy
in
her
life
as
she
was
on
realizing
that
she
had
helped
them
in
a
big
way
by
bringing
the
quinine
from
america
and
that
she
could
serve
them
still
more
by
contacting
their
relatives
and
friends
in
america
when
she
got
back
if
i
do
get
back
she
whispered
watching
scottie
down
those
jap
fighters
who
so
richly
deserved
to
die
she
had
realized
as
never
before
how
easy
it
was
for
a
life
just
any
life
her
life
to
go
out
like
a
match
in
a
high
wind
but
my
life
must
not
go
out
yet
she
told
herself
almost
fiercely
i
have
so
much
to
she
thought
again
of
the
messages
she
was
carrying
to
america
and
strangely
enough
of
the
roll
of
papyrus
she
could
not
but
feel
that
this
roll
was
somehow
very
important
most
important
of
all
was
the
cargo
it
must
go
through
she
told
herself
we
ve
only
a
little
farther
to
after
dinner
that
night
she
had
sat
on
a
log
beside
the
hop
sing
he
had
told
her
how
his
people
had
suffered
through
all
those
long
years
of
the
speechless
cruelties
of
the
japs
of
homes
destroyed
women
and
children
reduced
to
slavery
and
all
the
rest
and
now
help
was
enough
more
and
more
help
what
was
the
cargo
they
carried
once
again
this
question
came
up
to
intrigue
but
not
to
disturb
her
neither
she
nor
sparky
had
tried
hard
to
guess
the
answer
we
shall
know
she
assured
herself
it
won
t
be
long
why
were
all
those
bombers
heading
for
china
in
such
haste
would
they
help
retake
burma
and
with
it
the
burma
road
would
they
help
defend
russia
from
possible
jap
attack
would
they
bomb
tokio
she
could
not
guess
the
answer
but
having
visited
that
field
hospital
she
hoped
as
never
before
that
they
were
headed
for
tokio
and
i
d
love
to
go
with
them
she
told
herself
but
first
the
mountains
she
whispered
scottie
had
told
her
of
the
pass
how
during
the
monsoon
period
great
storms
went
roaring
up
the
sides
of
those
highest
mountains
of
the
world
you
can
t
imagine
those
were
his
words
snow
rising
like
smoke
a
thousand
two
three
thousand
feet
from
their
peaks
a
plane
caught
in
the
grip
of
such
a
storm
is
like
a
chip
caught
in
a
great
shivering
at
the
very
thought
mary
drew
the
covers
close
about
her
and
at
last
fell
fast
asleep
she
was
awake
an
hour
before
dawn
and
disturbed
by
an
overpowering
sense
of
something
wrong
drew
on
her
clothes
and
walked
outside
it
was
dark
gloomy
and
chilly
why
did
i
leave
my
cozy
bed
she
asked
herself
as
she
walked
across
the
narrow
airfield
and
then
among
the
shadows
of
many
planes
to
search
out
their
own
there
you
are
she
whispered
at
last
good
old
ship
to
her
surprise
she
saw
that
the
door
stood
slightly
ajar
instantly
her
curiosity
was
aroused
sparky
she
knew
had
not
slept
in
the
ship
for
all
that
he
may
have
arisen
early
to
look
things
over
before
the
big
day
that
there
were
guards
about
she
knew
quite
well
though
she
had
not
been
challenged
this
she
told
herself
was
not
strange
the
moon
was
down
it
was
the
darkest
hour
before
dawn
there
were
more
planes
on
the
field
than
ever
before
in
its
history
no
one
would
risk
a
light
and
yet
as
she
came
close
to
their
plane
she
thought
she
caught
a
faint
flicker
inside
its
cabin
this
did
not
startle
her
sparky
was
still
in
her
mind
she
would
surprise
him
it
would
be
nice
to
spend
an
hour
with
him
in
their
own
ship
before
dawn
on
a
day
that
should
mean
much
to
them
with
noiseless
footsteps
she
reached
the
plane
then
climbed
two
rounds
of
the
boarding
ladder
without
a
sound
she
opened
the
door
half
way
to
peer
into
the
darkness
did
some
good
gremlin
whisper
wait
who
can
say
she
did
wait
and
barely
suppressed
a
gasp
the
gleam
of
a
tiny
flashlight
reflected
by
some
bright
object
faintly
illuminated
a
face
within
the
cabin
it
was
not
sparky
not
a
man
at
all
but
a
woman
the
woman
in
black
she
thought
nearly
falling
from
the
ladder
she
was
sure
that
this
was
the
woman
who
had
fired
a
shot
at
her
back
there
in
the
city
fascinated
she
watched
the
woman
had
torn
the
top
from
a
corrugated
box
containing
a
unit
of
their
precious
cargo
and
was
studying
it
intently
this
mary
thought
must
be
her
heart
beat
a
wild
tattoo
in
her
excitement
she
must
have
made
some
slight
sound
the
light
blinked
out
there
came
the
sound
of
rushing
feet
and
before
she
could
think
or
move
she
was
knocked
from
the
ladder
landing
on
her
head
she
was
knocked
unconscious
momentarily
but
something
made
her
mind
fight
back
when
her
senses
started
returning
she
could
think
and
hear
but
could
neither
move
nor
speak
she
heard
steady
approaching
footsteps
a
guard
she
thought
oh
if
i
could
only
with
a
violent
effort
she
brought
back
her
power
of
motion
sitting
up
she
scream
it
was
not
a
loud
scream
but
enough
for
a
voice
said
mary
what
are
you
doing
here
what
has
happened
sparky
oh
i
m
so
glad
she
staggered
to
her
feet
what
is
it
he
was
near
now
the
lady
in
black
she
was
in
the
plane
she
broke
open
a
box
she
knows
the
secret
of
our
cargo
s
a
spy
perhaps
she
has
the
roll
of
papyrus
she
will
escape
and
she
must
not
there
her
voice
rose
as
there
came
the
sound
of
an
airplane
motor
there
s
a
plane
someone
is
with
her
they
must
have
stolen
a
plane
they
will
get
away
two
guards
came
racing
up
oh
it
s
you
the
taller
of
the
two
said
what
s
up
what
happened
a
woman
spy
was
going
over
the
cargo
of
our
plane
exclaimed
mary
she
saw
too
much
she
may
have
taken
something
with
her
we
ve
got
to
catch
illustration
the
lady
in
black
knows
the
secret
of
our
cargo
that
must
be
her
plane
warming
up
did
she
have
a
plane
why
was
she
allowed
to
land
sparky
demanded
no
plane
has
come
in
then
she
and
her
accomplice
are
planning
to
steal
a
plane
come
on
we
may
catch
them
yet
sparky
led
the
way
on
the
run
but
they
were
too
late
as
they
reached
the
runway
the
stolen
plane
went
gliding
over
the
cement
to
rise
into
the
air
that
s
a
fast
you
ll
need
a
fast
one
to
overtake
we
ll
take
scottie
s
plane
mary
exclaimed
it
s
gassed
and
oiled
ammunition
everything
i
helped
him
get
it
in
shape
last
night
it
s
really
fast
and
a
real
fighter
come
on
then
once
again
sparky
led
the
way
the
moment
his
feet
hit
the
ship
s
deck
he
had
the
motor
singing
all
right
mary
he
called
not
much
time
what
about
your
jacket
oxygen
mask
and
all
that
they
re
all
here
scottie
s
are
there
too
for
you
we
left
them
don
t
know
that
s
great
get
in
and
let
s
ramble
okay
boys
turn
us
loose
blocks
were
removed
from
before
the
wheels
the
motor
thundered
then
slowed
to
an
even
grind
they
glided
away
then
up
they
shot
into
the
sky
to
greet
the
dawn
that
comes
up
like
there
they
are
mary
exclaimed
heading
straight
for
the
mountains
what
luck
they
can
t
lose
us
now
we
ll
follow
them
straight
to
china
if
we
have
if
we
only
had
our
plane
perhaps
it
s
best
that
we
haven
t
this
may
be
tougher
than
you
imagine
and
this
plane
is
faster
than
our
yes
that
s
right
as
they
sped
on
the
sun
rose
the
sky
was
crystal
clear
far
ahead
of
them
triangles
of
deep
purple
where
shadows
lay
and
of
light
yellow
where
sunlight
fell
were
the
mountains
beautiful
she
murmured
beautiful
and
terrible
he
agreed
we
re
gaining
she
said
after
a
time
i
can
see
them
much
more
plainly
if
we
catch
up
with
mary
could
not
go
on
she
was
wondering
how
far
this
chase
would
take
them
and
how
it
was
to
end
sparky
had
said
they
were
headed
for
china
part
of
china
was
in
allied
hands
much
of
it
was
held
by
the
japs
they
ll
lead
us
over
she
spoke
aloud
and
fighters
may
come
out
to
meet
if
they
do
we
ll
shoot
them
down
she
declared
fiercely
you
should
have
seen
scottie
in
this
very
plane
yesterday
it
was
wonderful
you
have
all
the
luck
said
sparky
sparky
she
leaned
toward
him
suppose
we
don
t
come
from
this
trip
we
will
but
suppose
we
don
t
what
about
our
plane
and
its
cargo
scottie
knows
all
about
that
he
ll
take
it
through
none
of
us
is
absolutely
necessary
but
we
ll
come
back
mary
we
ll
take
our
own
plane
to
the
journey
s
look
she
pointed
toward
the
other
plane
that
momentarily
grew
larger
in
their
field
of
vision
they
ve
changed
their
course
they
re
heading
down
the
mountain
toward
the
highest
peak
of
all
said
sparky
the
one
nobody
s
ever
mary
had
read
of
this
peak
and
the
futile
attempts
men
had
made
to
scale
it
she
had
been
thrilled
then
but
now
she
shuddered
they
hope
to
tire
us
run
us
out
of
gas
sparky
tested
his
supply
of
fuel
they
ve
got
a
long
way
to
go
yet
but
we
must
be
careful
a
forced
landing
on
these
white
slopes
means
death
we
must
save
enough
gas
to
take
us
exactly
once
more
mary
s
mind
was
working
was
this
to
be
an
endurance
race
endurance
of
plane
of
fuel
and
human
courage
hardly
that
she
told
herself
we
should
be
up
with
them
in
less
than
a
half
through
the
clear
air
they
could
see
great
distances
far
ahead
perhaps
a
hundred
miles
stood
a
peak
much
higher
than
the
rest
was
this
the
highest
peak
of
all
she
had
no
way
of
telling
and
so
they
sped
on
ten
minutes
passed
fifteen
were
nearing
the
fleeing
plane
the
lofty
peak
was
very
near
sparky
studied
his
fuel
gages
in
twenty
minutes
we
must
turn
back
or
run
the
risk
of
crashing
among
these
or
in
jungles
at
the
mountain
they
came
nearer
ever
nearer
to
the
spy
and
her
plane
a
burst
of
fire
might
bring
them
down
even
now
said
sparky
but
his
fingers
did
not
reach
for
the
gun
controls
five
minutes
more
they
must
decide
to
turn
back
meant
defeat
could
they
face
that
or
should
they
turn
loose
the
fury
of
their
guns
but
what
was
this
the
fleeing
plane
faltered
began
to
fall
then
righted
itself
and
flew
on
ten
tense
seconds
passed
and
again
it
faltered
they
stole
the
sparky
s
voice
was
solemn
as
moses
they
did
not
take
time
to
check
the
ship
s
once
again
the
plane
picked
up
speed
only
once
and
then
like
a
kite
that
has
lost
its
tail
the
plane
began
to
fall
slowly
at
first
then
faster
and
faster
turning
over
and
over
she
was
a
spy
mary
said
forcing
her
eyes
away
from
the
sight
the
next
time
she
looked
the
plane
was
all
but
upon
the
mountain
the
slope
she
saw
it
crash
then
begin
rolling
over
and
over
down
it
spun
a
thousand
two
three
thousand
feet
they
followed
it
part
way
down
once
it
leaped
across
an
open
space
to
crash
again
then
to
roll
on
when
at
last
it
came
to
rest
a
faint
film
of
smoke
came
up
from
it
this
grew
dense
then
burst
into
a
red
flame
they
watched
nothing
moved
the
end
said
sparky
then
he
set
his
motor
roaring
to
speed
away
toward
the
small
airport
they
had
left
chapter
xviii
where
are
they
oh
they
re
gone
mary
exclaimed
in
dismay
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
airfield
what
they
can
t
be
but
they
are
the
bombers
are
gone
the
field
is
practically
it
was
true
warnings
of
an
approaching
storm
had
sent
the
big
bomber
squadron
roaring
on
its
way
over
the
mountains
but
mary
and
sparky
landed
a
moment
later
with
plenty
of
room
to
spare
to
mary
this
was
a
great
disappointment
she
dearly
loved
being
in
a
parade
always
had
and
flying
in
a
great
formation
like
that
was
a
big
parade
now
we
ll
have
to
go
it
alone
she
said
soberly
nothing
new
about
that
sparky
grinned
we
ve
made
it
alone
practically
all
the
way
and
you
re
bound
to
admit
that
we
ve
had
all
the
luck
any
flier
could
yes
all
the
luck
mary
repeated
slowly
you
re
tired
mary
sparky
said
with
a
show
of
sympathy
yes
i
guess
i
am
can
t
take
it
after
all
i
can
t
take
it
man
oh
man
he
roared
listen
to
you
talk
just
then
scottie
came
over
from
sparky
s
plane
i
covered
up
the
box
that
the
spy
pried
open
he
said
then
i
changed
the
loading
so
it
s
on
the
bottom
and
believe
it
or
not
he
added
i
didn
t
the
secret
compartment
mary
s
voice
rose
had
it
been
broken
open
don
t
know
a
thing
about
a
secret
compartment
was
scottie
s
reply
i
went
over
the
cabin
with
a
comb
everything
but
that
box
seemed
then
the
roll
of
papyrus
is
still
there
and
wasn
t
burned
up
in
that
mary
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
so
that
s
what
happened
said
scottie
their
plane
yes
it
mary
spoke
slowly
no
other
questions
were
asked
the
colonel
said
if
you
didn
t
bring
my
plane
back
in
hours
scottie
laughed
low
that
i
could
have
and
you
said
sparky
asked
i
said
it
would
be
a
fair
enough
trade
but
that
guys
like
you
and
mary
always
came
yes
mary
agreed
we
always
come
mary
said
sparky
i
m
going
over
our
plane
every
bit
of
it
people
who
open
secret
cargoes
also
put
emery
in
engines
cut
fuel
pipes
and
all
that
when
we
go
over
those
peaks
everything
has
to
be
it
certainly
mary
was
seeing
again
those
cold
white
slopes
where
a
plane
forced
to
land
goes
rolling
down
down
down
to
dizzy
depths
below
i
ll
go
get
a
cup
of
coffee
she
said
dreamily
and
have
a
good
rest
said
sparky
we
may
go
over
the
big
top
yet
today
that
all
while
she
was
drinking
her
coffee
mary
was
joined
by
the
captain
who
had
helped
her
save
the
secret
cargo
from
the
hijackers
sparky
tells
me
that
you
chased
that
woman
spy
to
her
death
he
said
mary
nodded
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
he
went
on
that
while
you
were
gone
i
did
a
little
investigating
that
woman
flew
to
a
small
airport
owned
by
a
rich
native
about
forty
miles
from
here
she
must
have
motored
over
here
though
her
car
wasn
t
found
had
an
accomplice
no
doubt
a
man
i
got
on
the
phone
he
went
on
tells
me
she
checks
with
a
native
indian
woman
who
studied
in
america
but
who
soured
on
americans
for
some
reason
or
other
and
so
went
into
spying
looks
as
if
you
and
sparky
have
done
the
country
a
great
m
glad
mary
swallowed
hard
but
for
my
part
i
ll
do
my
bit
some
other
way
after
two
hours
later
mary
was
wakened
from
a
dream
in
which
she
was
riding
on
an
ocean
liner
gliding
rapidly
down
a
swiftly
moving
mountain
stream
mary
mary
it
was
sparky
calling
outside
her
tent
i
m
sorry
but
orders
have
come
through
by
radio
we
are
to
start
within
the
hour
okay
i
ll
join
you
at
the
canteen
for
our
last
cup
of
java
in
here
s
sparky
was
away
it
s
not
too
promising
he
was
telling
her
a
half
hour
later
talking
between
gulps
of
steaming
hot
coffee
the
barometer
is
falling
a
storm
is
on
the
way
but
the
big
shots
figure
we
can
make
it
this
time
of
year
it
storms
for
weeks
once
it
gets
a
good
start
and
it
seems
our
cargo
is
vital
to
some
great
sparky
mary
drawled
sleepily
the
next
time
you
and
i
fly
together
we
ll
insist
on
having
a
cargo
of
toothpicks
crackers
chewing
gum
and
something
that
doesn
t
count
too
much
he
grinned
i
wonder
it
strikes
me
that
you
re
just
the
sort
that
insists
on
doing
hard
important
things
all
the
you
might
be
right
at
that
and
perhaps
i
ve
got
a
buddy
that
s
built
along
the
same
lines
she
answered
smiling
might
be
he
agreed
anyway
the
next
hop
promises
to
be
both
important
and
tough
so
we
d
better
get
he
slid
off
the
stool
five
minutes
later
having
been
joined
by
hop
sing
they
were
back
at
the
plane
heavily
padded
suits
jackets
and
marvelous
wool
socks
were
selected
with
great
care
for
all
sparky
went
through
the
business
of
getting
set
for
a
long
flight
then
when
his
motors
were
rolling
nodded
to
the
mechanic
and
they
went
gliding
away
as
if
by
way
of
a
warning
from
the
storm
gods
as
they
cleared
the
treetops
a
stiff
push
of
wind
lifted
their
plane
high
then
let
it
down
with
a
bump
oh
ho
sparky
shouted
so
that
s
how
it
is
blow
high
blow
low
not
all
your
snow
can
stop
our
motors
steady
he
was
in
high
spirits
but
mary
was
ill
at
ease
they
say
that
women
have
instincts
she
said
to
sparky
meaning
what
nothing
much
i
he
set
the
ship
climbing
they
went
speeding
on
toward
those
eternal
fields
of
white
perhaps
the
events
of
the
morning
had
shaken
mary
s
usually
steady
nerves
then
again
the
strain
of
long
exciting
days
and
nights
had
begun
to
tell
be
that
as
it
may
as
they
came
closer
and
closer
to
those
mountains
of
eternal
snow
her
apprehension
increased
they
came
close
to
the
place
where
they
must
climb
and
climb
again
to
make
the
pass
in
safety
and
she
was
obliged
to
confess
to
herself
that
she
was
really
frightened
at
that
moment
she
recalled
the
words
of
a
pilot
who
had
crossed
many
times
they
call
it
a
pass
but
it
s
only
a
slightly
lower
level
between
two
towering
she
looked
at
the
peaks
and
the
narrow
depression
that
lay
between
them
at
the
same
time
she
thought
she
had
discovered
a
change
in
the
peaks
that
lay
far
to
the
left
some
of
them
are
gone
she
said
gone
what
s
gone
sparky
asked
mountains
they
don
t
go
away
they
re
eternal
it
says
so
in
the
all
the
same
there
are
not
as
many
as
there
were
mary
insisted
sparky
gave
her
a
sharp
look
then
he
gazed
away
to
the
left
by
thunder
you
re
right
he
exclaimed
they
are
vanishing
know
what
that
means
a
storm
absolutely
with
the
direction
of
the
wind
quartering
to
the
direction
the
range
takes
that
storm
will
come
and
come
and
illustration
that
means
a
storm
sparky
even
as
mary
watched
the
view
away
to
the
left
changed
instead
of
simply
disappearing
each
mountain
began
to
it
wasn
t
smoke
she
knew
that
it
was
snow
blown
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
of
feet
into
the
air
as
the
moments
passed
the
thing
grew
in
horror
and
intensity
striking
the
mountains
at
an
angle
the
storm
appeared
to
creep
upon
them
like
a
thief
in
the
night
it
s
coming
sparky
she
exclaimed
yes
coming
he
agreed
and
we
re
can
we
beat
it
if
we
can
t
we
can
fight
it
i
ve
seen
storms
not
a
white
yes
white
not
over
the
have
it
your
own
way
he
grumbled
anyway
we
ll
fight
we
ve
got
it
to
frightened
within
an
inch
of
her
life
yet
fascinated
by
the
strangeness
the
expression
of
power
the
beauty
of
it
all
she
watched
the
storm
arrive
now
there
were
twelve
mountains
in
the
calm
that
lay
between
them
and
their
destiny
now
one
more
mountain
smoked
leaving
eleven
now
there
were
ten
eight
six
five
four
three
sparky
it
s
almost
here
no
a
grim
look
of
utter
determination
sparky
it
s
here
as
if
a
white
blanket
had
been
wrapped
about
their
plane
everything
before
them
vanished
at
the
same
time
as
if
it
were
a
child
s
toy
the
storm
caught
their
plane
and
carried
it
aloft
the
motors
still
turned
but
meant
nothing
had
the
plane
ever
traveled
so
fast
before
mary
doubted
it
where
were
they
where
was
the
mountain
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
must
be
approaching
the
stars
a
stinging
cold
crept
in
everywhere
and
then
just
as
she
had
begun
to
despair
still
as
if
they
were
toy
people
in
a
toy
plane
of
a
toy
world
the
storm
gave
their
plane
a
final
push
turned
it
completely
over
then
abandoned
it
to
its
fate
they
began
to
drop
the
motors
were
no
longer
turning
had
that
intense
cold
rendered
them
useless
if
so
their
fate
was
sealed
with
benumbed
fingers
sparky
tried
a
switch
here
another
there
there
came
a
faint
humming
sound
it
grew
and
grew
somewhere
a
wheel
turned
then
another
then
suddenly
the
motors
roared
with
great
skill
sparky
plied
his
wings
his
tail
controls
until
slowly
like
some
great
graceful
bird
the
plane
turned
over
the
motors
roared
on
five
minutes
more
and
they
were
hanging
in
calm
clouded
skies
question
right
now
is
where
are
we
sparky
said
after
a
moment
s
silence
the
bear
went
over
the
mountain
he
hummed
yes
but
did
we
mary
asked
no
one
cared
to
risk
his
reputation
on
an
answer
to
that
question
chapter
xix
elmo
s
fire
if
there
are
mountains
about
it
s
always
best
to
sparky
set
his
plane
to
reach
higher
altitudes
when
at
last
he
felt
the
push
of
strong
winds
behind
him
he
said
the
storm
took
us
over
the
mountains
all
that
s
something
to
be
thankful
for
said
mary
yes
but
we
re
still
more
or
less
this
they
discovered
was
truer
than
they
had
thought
for
the
cold
or
the
push
and
bang
of
the
storm
had
damaged
their
radio
try
as
she
might
mary
could
raise
no
one
for
a
time
flying
by
instrument
sparky
flew
across
what
he
hoped
was
low
level
land
since
he
could
not
be
sure
of
this
he
still
flew
high
among
the
thick
clouds
when
at
last
in
desperation
he
dropped
lower
and
lower
until
they
were
dangerously
close
to
the
earth
they
found
themselves
still
in
a
dense
formation
of
clouds
where
are
we
mary
asked
somewhere
over
the
part
held
by
our
own
people
or
by
the
enemy
there
is
no
sure
way
to
know
here
take
the
ship
let
me
at
that
radio
we
ve
just
got
to
get
it
whether
this
was
a
must
or
not
did
not
appear
to
matter
the
radio
was
dead
and
apparently
would
remain
so
to
make
matters
worse
the
shadows
within
the
plane
grew
darker
with
every
passing
moment
night
mary
thought
night
over
a
strange
night
settled
down
and
still
they
cruised
on
from
time
to
time
they
came
down
close
to
earth
often
too
close
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
break
in
the
clouds
of
spotting
a
landing
beacon
no
break
was
found
no
light
appeared
our
position
is
growing
desperate
sparky
said
at
last
our
fuel
is
running
low
in
less
than
a
half
hour
we
ll
be
obliged
to
make
a
blind
landing
and
that
yes
mary
knew
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
answer
i
think
i
d
better
get
the
ship
aloft
then
let
the
rest
of
you
take
to
sparky
s
voice
was
husky
for
better
or
worse
this
looks
like
journey
s
i
guess
you
d
better
let
hop
sing
use
his
parachute
it
will
be
safer
for
yes
and
for
not
so
much
better
sparky
perhaps
much
worse
for
me
if
we
re
over
enemy
territory
i
m
staying
with
the
okay
it
s
your
life
i
can
t
live
it
for
for
a
little
time
they
were
silent
about
time
to
do
a
little
sparky
shifted
his
controls
sparky
what
was
that
mary
cried
sharply
what
was
what
a
light
i
didn
t
see
any
yes
there
no
now
it
s
gone
yes
yes
there
it
is
by
the
nose
of
the
plane
yes
i
saw
it
sparky
seemed
unimpressed
but
look
sparky
she
exclaimed
look
at
the
radio
antennae
they
re
like
neon
tubes
they
they
re
burning
up
sparky
what
s
going
to
happen
is
the
ship
on
fire
not
so
you
can
notice
but
sparky
look
there
s
a
ball
of
fire
on
the
ship
s
as
a
fourth
of
july
balloon
now
it
s
gone
but
look
there
s
a
flash
right
across
the
propeller
blades
say
we
can
begin
to
see
things
she
was
fairly
beside
herself
i
just
saw
a
house
and
a
clump
of
the
clouds
are
lifting
said
sparky
there
may
be
a
s
a
road
it
s
broad
and
white
must
be
mary
grabbed
sparky
s
arm
sparky
we
re
going
to
be
safe
we
ve
been
saved
by
some
kind
of
miracle
miracle
my
eye
sparky
grumbled
as
he
set
his
ship
for
a
try
at
landing
on
that
road
if
i
don
t
hit
it
right
on
the
beam
he
said
grimly
we
ll
crash
and
that
means
like
as
not
that
this
whole
trip
has
been
made
for
no
not
for
nothing
don
t
forget
there
s
the
quinine
with
balls
of
fire
rolling
all
over
the
plane
and
with
their
landing
lights
on
for
a
space
of
seconds
they
hit
that
hard
road
bounced
hit
again
and
again
then
began
to
glide
just
before
the
ship
came
to
a
stop
the
right
wheel
left
the
road
to
bury
itself
in
soft
mud
nice
thing
to
do
at
the
very
end
sparky
growled
if
we
re
in
enemy
territory
we
re
in
a
bad
way
snapping
off
the
lights
he
headed
for
the
door
all
the
strange
rolling
balls
of
light
were
gone
about
them
it
was
dark
as
a
subway
when
the
lights
are
off
sparky
mary
insisted
as
her
feet
hit
the
pavement
it
was
a
miracle
you
don
t
dare
say
it
wasn
t
oh
can
t
i
sparky
squeezed
her
arm
at
least
i
m
bound
to
try
that
my
dear
mary
was
what
they
call
elmo
s
st
elmo
s
fire
sure
it
s
a
form
of
electrical
disturbance
i
picked
it
up
once
when
i
was
half
way
across
the
atlantic
the
scientists
say
it
s
harmless
probably
they
re
partly
right
but
i
claim
that
a
thing
that
scares
you
to
death
can
t
be
entirely
harmless
and
now
he
added
since
we
ve
put
one
more
ghost
to
rest
let
s
find
out
where
we
hop
sing
he
called
right
here
hop
sing
this
is
your
country
china
where
are
we
can
t
i
go
see
mebby
quick
find
somebody
who
live
here
then
quick
find
the
of
hop
sing
s
crutch
faded
into
the
distance
after
that
by
the
plane
for
quite
some
time
there
was
silence
sparky
i
m
tired
mary
said
at
last
i
hope
we
can
get
to
the
end
of
our
trip
don
t
hope
too
much
he
cautioned
we
wandered
about
in
the
sky
a
long
time
and
that
storm
may
really
have
taken
us
places
before
it
let
us
the
darkness
was
something
to
brood
about
the
big
plane
loomed
like
a
shadow
above
them
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
they
again
heard
the
of
hop
sing
s
crutch
as
it
came
closer
mary
became
conscious
of
another
sound
it
was
like
the
wind
rustling
through
dry
leaves
or
was
it
a
shuffling
sound
before
she
knew
it
she
found
herself
surrounded
by
silent
shadowy
forms
and
hop
sing
was
talking
in
a
hoarse
whisper
to
sparky
hop
sing
s
report
was
both
astonishing
and
terrifying
they
were
twenty
miles
behind
the
jap
lines
the
road
on
which
they
had
landed
ran
parallel
to
the
lines
that
was
why
on
a
dark
night
like
this
there
was
no
traffic
men
ammunition
and
supplies
going
to
the
front
traveled
a
road
some
fifteen
miles
away
a
road
that
crossed
this
one
the
shadowy
forms
about
them
were
chinese
men
women
and
children
these
astonishing
people
had
hidden
in
the
mountains
until
the
battle
lines
had
swept
over
them
now
still
hiding
in
holes
and
cellars
they
were
back
near
their
homes
most
surprising
of
all
sparky
whispered
to
mary
a
half
mile
down
this
road
and
off
to
one
side
there
is
a
small
an
airfield
didn
t
the
japs
destroy
it
or
do
they
use
it
neither
they
know
nothing
about
it
it
s
a
turnip
patch
just
a
turnip
patch
illustration
sing
s
report
was
sure
these
chinese
are
smart
this
airfield
has
always
been
a
secret
one
before
the
japs
came
they
kept
it
covered
with
nets
and
burlap
that
made
it
look
like
plowed
ground
they
only
used
it
at
night
for
fuel
that
s
what
we
need
yes
and
it
s
sparky
spoke
rapidly
it
s
in
a
hidden
underground
room
two
drums
of
what
are
we
going
to
do
nothing
these
people
like
gremlins
gnomes
or
something
are
going
to
do
it
for
us
they
ll
get
the
plane
back
on
the
road
that
s
what
they
re
doing
the
plane
gave
a
sudden
lurch
and
then
then
some
of
them
will
pull
and
push
the
plane
down
the
road
while
the
women
and
children
remove
enough
turnips
and
earth
from
the
airfield
to
make
us
a
and
then
we
ll
fuel
up
and
take
off
how
sweet
yes
if
the
japs
don
t
come
our
journey
s
end
is
only
two
hundred
miles
and
if
the
japs
come
we
ll
fight
these
chinese
have
arms
we
ve
got
two
machine
guns
we
ll
put
up
a
good
the
big
plane
with
its
precious
cargo
tilted
back
to
the
road
bed
then
slowly
yard
by
yard
it
rolled
down
the
half
mile
to
the
airfield
there
by
the
sense
of
touch
alone
since
no
lights
could
be
allowed
sparky
felt
his
way
across
the
prepared
runway
and
mary
supervised
the
refueling
of
the
plane
and
all
the
time
hop
sing
was
pouring
into
her
ears
stories
of
his
people
s
courage
and
heroism
oh
she
breathed
at
last
i
do
hope
we
can
make
it
i
don
t
know
what
it
s
all
about
but
i
do
know
that
it
will
mean
a
great
deal
to
these
noble
fighting
at
last
all
was
ready
with
the
aid
of
a
very
faint
light
sparky
and
mary
went
through
the
business
of
getting
the
ship
going
at
last
sparky
gave
an
order
to
hop
sing
hop
sing
passed
it
to
those
on
the
ground
the
motors
thundered
and
up
mary
exclaimed
we
re
in
the
air
again
that
s
not
all
sparky
added
happily
the
air
is
clearing
and
we
have
gas
to
carry
us
to
our
they
reached
it
before
the
hour
was
up
recognizing
the
roar
of
their
plane
a
member
of
the
bomber
squadron
s
crew
sent
up
a
small
plane
to
guide
them
in
ah
at
last
you
re
here
shouted
a
voice
the
bomber
squadron
s
flight
commander
pulled
himself
into
their
cabin
we
ll
have
men
here
in
a
moment
to
take
off
your
cargo
it
is
of
vital
importance
that
s
all
i
can
tell
you
me
said
mary
all
i
want
is
there
s
a
car
waiting
for
you
right
now
it
will
take
you
to
the
city
s
best
little
hotel
which
is
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
mary
fell
asleep
in
the
car
she
roused
herself
long
enough
to
reach
her
room
and
undress
then
she
traded
the
world
of
harsh
realities
for
one
of
pleasant
dreams
chapter
xx
deep
secrets
revealed
when
mary
awoke
with
the
sun
shining
on
her
face
through
a
small
window
next
morning
it
was
with
a
vague
feeling
that
something
was
gone
oh
she
exclaimed
jumping
out
of
bed
i
ve
slept
too
long
sparky
has
left
me
when
her
bare
feet
hit
the
floor
she
awoke
to
the
reality
of
things
it
s
all
over
she
sighed
sinking
back
on
her
bed
we
ve
reached
the
journey
s
end
at
then
with
a
fresh
thought
stirring
her
to
action
she
hurried
through
her
toilet
and
donned
her
dusty
uniform
perhaps
this
is
going
to
be
like
christmas
morning
when
secrets
are
revealed
just
perhaps
she
whispered
after
a
hasty
breakfast
she
begged
a
ride
out
to
the
airfield
it
was
a
fairly
large
airdrome
the
runways
were
neither
long
nor
numerous
but
back
among
the
trees
cement
had
been
laid
making
hiding
places
for
many
planes
and
the
planes
were
there
sparky
she
exclaimed
as
she
came
upon
her
companion
of
many
adventures
look
at
the
planes
there
must
be
two
hundred
of
fully
that
many
sparky
agreed
and
all
what
does
it
mean
what
is
their
mission
your
guess
is
as
good
as
mine
he
grinned
we
would
guess
the
same
thing
i
am
and
might
be
yes
but
one
thing
is
certain
about
a
hundred
of
them
are
being
equipped
with
the
same
type
of
gadget
and
they
all
came
from
the
packing
cases
that
only
a
few
hours
ago
rode
in
our
sparky
what
are
they
shush
he
whispered
it
s
still
a
deep
military
secret
they
are
being
provided
with
a
new
and
more
perfect
type
of
bombsight
than
ever
has
been
used
so
that
was
it
sounds
quite
simple
doesn
t
it
very
but
in
this
world
the
answers
to
most
great
mysteries
are
usually
quite
simple
in
this
case
however
the
mystery
concerned
something
of
tremendous
importance
these
planes
have
been
assembled
here
for
a
task
that
the
japs
would
give
a
prince
or
two
to
know
about
our
flight
of
bombers
of
course
brought
their
own
bombsights
and
they
brought
other
much
needed
equipment
for
some
reason
known
only
to
the
big
shots
the
bombsights
for
planes
already
here
were
entrusted
to
our
and
if
that
jap
spy
or
the
woman
in
black
had
wrecked
our
plane
that
would
have
been
just
too
bad
but
they
didn
t
so
you
and
i
are
to
be
attending
a
banquet
in
your
honor
tonight
it
s
to
be
quite
a
brilliant
affair
officers
from
the
armies
of
china
great
britain
and
america
are
to
be
there
what
s
more
you
are
to
make
a
oh
no
sparky
she
cried
no
no
no
it
won
t
be
hard
not
really
he
assured
her
they
ll
want
to
know
about
the
first
overseas
trip
made
by
a
waf
if
you
tell
them
half
the
things
that
have
happened
to
you
they
ll
be
forever
convinced
that
the
ladies
of
the
ferry
command
can
really
take
since
you
put
it
that
way
mary
replied
soberly
i
ve
got
to
that
s
the
girl
sparky
applauded
mary
could
be
quite
the
lady
when
occasion
demanded
the
wife
of
a
flying
colonel
took
her
under
her
wing
to
help
her
with
dress
and
the
beautiful
gown
she
had
worn
in
egypt
was
still
at
hand
and
so
it
happened
that
a
young
flying
lieutenant
was
heard
to
remark
as
she
entered
glorious
dame
she
never
flew
a
plane
in
her
life
catching
the
words
mary
blushed
but
forgave
the
lieutenant
on
the
spot
had
not
the
very
substantial
sparky
still
in
his
uniform
been
seated
at
her
side
to
nod
in
confirmation
to
every
strange
tale
she
told
there
might
have
been
many
an
older
head
that
would
have
questioned
her
story
as
it
turned
out
she
was
quite
the
lady
of
the
hour
for
all
that
when
she
found
sparky
next
morning
the
first
thing
she
asked
was
when
do
we
leave
and
how
we
re
leaving
the
good
old
lone
star
behind
he
admitted
sadly
it
s
needed
for
fighting
china
s
then
i
ll
forgive
them
she
replied
instantly
at
that
moment
she
was
once
again
seeing
shadowy
forms
and
a
heavy
plane
moving
down
a
dark
highway
and
hearing
the
crippled
hop
sing
tell
the
story
of
his
brave
people
but
how
are
we
going
to
america
is
that
it
yes
and
where
is
our
roll
of
papyrus
the
papyrus
is
still
in
the
secret
compartment
on
our
plane
we
ll
go
and
get
it
right
now
you
ll
carry
it
in
your
traveling
just
for
luck
and
perhaps
a
little
further
adventure
as
to
our
mode
of
travel
to
san
francisco
he
added
i
m
told
that
we
are
to
travel
just
as
we
have
done
in
america
after
we
have
delivered
a
by
transport
plane
that
s
dull
but
restful
she
sighed
i
m
all
for
two
days
later
together
with
a
score
of
officers
and
men
of
official
distinction
bound
for
home
on
leave
or
on
business
they
climbed
aboard
a
giant
airliner
and
headed
out
over
the
pacific
after
long
hours
of
travel
they
came
swooping
down
upon
a
broad
island
airfield
that
as
far
as
they
are
concerned
will
remain
forever
unnamed
here
they
were
greeted
by
hundreds
of
american
soldiers
who
at
first
stared
at
mary
in
disbelief
then
let
out
a
lusty
cheer
beneath
the
palms
that
night
with
only
the
stars
for
light
and
with
soldiers
sailors
and
nurses
as
an
audience
mary
told
her
story
all
over
again
in
the
very
midst
of
her
talk
someone
set
a
shiny
object
down
before
her
then
whispered
you
re
doing
great
sister
keep
right
cheered
by
the
marvelous
attention
of
her
audience
she
talked
for
an
hour
only
to
learn
in
the
end
what
she
had
suspected
all
along
that
the
last
half
of
her
talk
had
been
broadcast
by
short
wave
to
america
now
there
ll
be
no
living
with
you
mary
sparky
laughed
as
he
escorted
her
to
the
nurses
tent
where
she
was
to
spend
the
night
in
heaven
s
name
why
she
exclaimed
you
re
famous
nothing
like
that
she
laughed
just
a
flying
fool
of
the
ferry
from
here
they
hopped
along
in
a
leisurely
manner
to
honolulu
many
a
time
in
her
younger
days
mary
had
dreamed
of
sitting
beneath
the
palms
on
the
hawaiian
islands
but
on
this
trip
she
had
seen
palms
in
brazil
north
africa
egypt
persia
india
china
and
the
islands
of
the
sea
what
s
one
palm
more
or
less
she
said
to
sparky
here
s
hoping
we
catch
an
early
plane
they
were
obliged
to
wait
two
days
before
the
long
hop
for
san
francisco
it
was
on
the
evening
of
their
last
day
at
honolulu
while
they
were
seated
in
the
lounge
of
their
hotel
that
a
real
thrill
came
over
them
as
they
listened
to
the
radio
listen
sparky
sat
up
suddenly
mary
shifted
to
face
the
radio
we
are
now
permitted
to
report
said
a
voice
in
far
away
china
that
four
days
ago
tokio
was
heavily
bombed
by
an
airforce
of
great
strength
and
that
an
enormous
amount
of
damage
was
done
to
steel
mills
airplane
factories
and
other
objectives
all
our
planes
returned
safely
to
their
here
it
comes
mary
whispered
tensely
it
s
the
sparky
agreed
here
in
the
studio
with
me
now
the
voice
on
the
radio
went
on
is
flight
commander
major
tom
cole
major
cole
will
you
tell
us
a
little
about
that
raid
i
certainly
will
came
in
another
voice
it
was
magnificently
planned
and
executed
with
great
daring
and
tremendous
were
you
able
to
sight
your
objectives
and
how
those
bombardiers
just
laid
those
blockbusters
right
on
top
of
the
was
much
damage
done
i
should
say
that
fully
a
third
of
the
factories
mills
and
steel
mills
in
the
tokio
area
had
been
put
out
of
commission
for
weeks
perhaps
and
tokio
itself
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
i
lived
in
a
paper
house
i
d
never
start
a
thank
you
major
oh
one
thing
more
there
is
a
rumor
about
that
a
girl
mary
mason
of
the
wafs
had
something
to
do
with
the
success
of
this
effort
could
this
be
true
not
only
could
it
be
is
true
much
of
the
success
of
this
mission
is
due
to
the
loyal
service
of
the
young
lady
you
mentioned
i
of
course
can
t
give
you
details
i
will
say
that
she
no
longer
is
in
in
honolulu
i
wouldn
t
know
those
gals
really
get
about
all
i
want
to
say
is
that
wherever
mary
mason
is
tonight
our
hats
are
off
to
her
every
man
who
flew
on
that
mission
would
be
glad
to
shake
her
and
so
ladies
and
the
broadcast
ended
oh
mary
breathed
sinking
deep
into
her
big
chair
what
did
you
say
as
mary
started
for
her
room
a
short
while
later
a
reporter
stepped
up
to
her
might
you
be
mary
mason
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
i
might
and
i
might
not
you
should
know
that
we
are
not
permitted
to
divulge
secrets
to
strangers
particularly
when
we
are
on
once
more
mary
was
on
her
way
when
they
landed
in
san
francisco
one
morning
at
nine
mary
carried
a
mysterious
package
under
her
arm
sparky
she
said
i
ve
carried
this
roll
of
papyrus
half
way
round
the
world
the
first
thing
i
want
to
do
in
america
is
to
get
rid
of
okay
i
m
with
you
was
his
quick
response
we
ll
sit
on
a
stool
long
enough
for
coffee
toast
and
bacon
then
we
ll
be
on
our
when
three
hours
later
they
alighted
from
a
cab
before
an
imposing
home
hidden
behind
tall
shrubbery
in
one
of
the
city
s
finest
suburbs
mary
s
hands
gripped
the
roll
of
papyrus
her
tense
fingers
trembled
slightly
as
with
sparky
at
her
side
she
marched
up
the
winding
walk
this
is
the
place
she
whispered
and
this
the
hour
he
agreed
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
everything
will
be
fine
and
all
the
same
i
don
t
like
she
gripped
his
arm
i
d
rather
be
right
up
there
in
the
even
in
burma
yes
even
just
then
a
half
block
away
a
heavy
car
slid
up
to
the
curb
three
husky
men
sprang
out
and
marched
briskly
up
the
street
the
cast
is
all
here
the
stage
is
set
sparky
whispered
as
he
rang
the
door
bell
their
ring
was
answered
at
once
a
maid
ushered
them
in
she
led
them
to
a
door
tapped
then
waited
come
in
come
in
a
large
voice
welcomed
as
the
door
swung
open
i
have
been
expecting
the
large
man
waved
them
to
chairs
close
by
his
mahogany
desk
now
we
shall
see
he
breathed
heavily
as
his
hand
gripped
the
roll
of
papyrus
perhaps
this
is
genuine
and
perhaps
after
unrolling
the
parchment
he
sat
for
a
full
minute
studying
the
first
full
sheet
through
his
thick
intently
that
one
might
have
said
he
was
trying
to
read
something
not
written
there
at
all
sparky
gave
mary
a
meaningful
look
yes
the
big
man
drew
in
a
deep
breath
this
is
genuine
and
should
be
of
great
service
to
humanity
by
revealing
the
real
life
of
those
strange
beings
who
lived
so
long
ago
you
have
been
at
great
pains
to
bring
this
to
he
doesn
t
know
the
half
of
it
mary
thought
smiling
to
herself
you
must
allow
me
to
pay
you
for
your
trouble
he
went
on
how
much
do
i
owe
you
oh
mary
hated
herself
for
stammering
but
i
wish
you
would
look
at
all
the
sheets
and
count
them
she
added
hesitatingly
very
well
i
shall
do
as
you
the
big
man
s
thumb
and
finger
reached
for
the
first
sheet
sparky
half
rose
in
his
chair
from
outside
came
a
faint
sound
one
the
big
man
counted
two
three
mary
s
heart
fluttered
and
the
big
man
did
not
finish
instead
he
sat
there
staring
and
as
he
did
so
his
face
purpled
a
slip
of
paper
had
been
inserted
between
the
sheets
of
papyrus
on
it
had
been
written
these
words
you
are
peter
that
was
all
this
could
have
been
a
harmless
trick
had
he
not
for
years
lived
in
america
under
quite
another
name
and
had
not
peter
schwartz
been
wanted
for
some
time
by
certain
gentlemen
who
made
their
homes
in
washington
half
rising
in
his
chair
the
big
man
reached
for
the
drawer
of
his
desk
sparky
beat
him
to
it
striking
his
arm
down
and
then
the
big
man
found
himself
surrounded
by
three
men
each
as
large
as
himself
and
more
powerful
a
pair
of
handcuffs
clicked
come
on
schwartz
one
of
the
men
said
gruffly
while
another
lingered
for
a
word
with
mary
and
sparky
nice
work
he
commended
the
owes
you
a
debt
of
gratitude
as
does
our
most
of
the
credit
goes
to
mary
s
father
said
sparky
and
to
his
friends
the
egyptologist
and
the
one
who
knows
so
much
about
mary
amended
you
see
said
sparky
as
soon
as
we
showed
them
the
roll
of
papyrus
they
put
a
sheet
of
it
under
the
and
that
brought
out
all
sorts
of
things
you
couldn
t
see
with
the
eye
mary
broke
in
maps
charts
figures
and
all
kinds
of
messages
in
enough
to
tell
our
enemy
all
they
d
like
to
know
about
egypt
the
now
agreed
they
ll
never
know
now
the
proper
sort
of
bath
will
remove
all
their
fancy
maps
and
messages
and
he
paused
what
about
that
roll
of
papyrus
let
us
know
when
you
re
through
using
it
as
evidence
said
sparky
then
we
ll
try
to
find
out
what
will
happen
to
it
ten
minutes
later
they
were
once
more
out
in
the
glorious
sunshine
of
their
native
land
sparky
hailed
a
cab
and
together
they
rode
to
the
little
hotel
where
the
girls
of
the
ferry
command
stay
when
they
are
in
the
city
as
they
entered
the
lobby
mary
saw
one
of
the
girls
she
knew
greetings
she
called
same
to
you
came
back
where
did
you
just
come
in
from
been
round
the
world
mary
smiled
slyly
oh
yeah
then
the
girl
s
look
changed
say
that
s
right
you
re
mary
mason
i
heard
you
on
the
radio
oh
i
hoped
no
one
would
hear
mary
was
startled
everybody
did
say
it
was
great
and
now
all
the
girls
want
to
cross
the
ocean
and
say
there
s
a
telegram
for
you
at
the
desk
yes
and
a
a
telegram
a
letter
mary
marched
to
the
desk
received
the
telegram
and
the
letter
then
stood
staring
the
letter
had
given
her
a
real
thrill
it
was
not
really
a
letter
only
a
picture
on
a
postcard
with
some
writing
on
the
back
the
picture
was
of
a
fine
young
american
soldier
in
uniform
on
its
back
she
read
you
asked
for
it
so
here
it
it
was
signed
jerry
that
boy
in
south
america
she
whispered
how
grand
but
the
telegram
what
s
the
matter
bad
news
sparky
asked
i
ll
say
so
mary
made
a
face
it
s
from
the
waf
central
office
they
ve
booked
me
to
appear
before
three
women
s
flying
clubs
i
m
to
recruit
fliers
for
our
organization
oh
when
will
we
two
fly
again
time
enough
for
that
said
sparky
just
let
me
know
when
your
lecture
tour
is
over
and
i
ll
see
what
can
be
cooked
up
well
mary
he
said
as
their
hands
met
you
saw
a
lot
of
nice
boys
on
that
i
sure
did
her
eyes
shone
but
the
best
of
them
was
the
one
who
met
you
in
egypt
sparky
said
smilingly
that
s
right
next
to
him
the
finest
of
them
all
was
the
guy
who
went
with
me
all
the
thanks
mary
i
m
glad
you
feel
that
way
for
you
re
the
grandest
girl
i
know
