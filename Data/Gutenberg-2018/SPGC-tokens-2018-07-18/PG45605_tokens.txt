we

his
mysterious
head
through
the
veiled
eyes
no
flickering

from
his

gleaming
light
is
shed
as
from

inward
bent
his

there
glows

lingers
otherwise
the

not

you

the

steal

nor
could
this
stark

stunted

display
vibrance
beneath
the
shoulders
heavy

nor
shine
like
fur
upon
a

of
prey
nor
break
forth
from

like

each

kindling

preface
rodin
has
pronounced
rilke
essay
the
supreme
interpretation
of
his
work
a
few
years
ago
the
sculptor
expressed
to
the
translators
the
wish
that
some
day
the
book
might
be
placed
before
the
public
the
appreciation
was
published
originally
as
one
of
a
series
of
art
monographs
under
the
editorship
of
the
late
richard
muther
to
estimate
and
interpret
the
work
of
an
artist
is
to
be
creatively
just
to
him
for
this
reason
there
are
fewer
critics
than
there
are
artists
and
criticism
with
but
few
exceptions
is
almost
invariably
negligible
and
futile
the
strongest
and
most
procreant
contact
is
that
which
takes
place
between
two
creative
minds
this
book
of
rilke
on
rodin
is
the
fruit
of
such
a
contact
it
ripened
on
the
tree
of
a
great
friendship
for
the
master
for
a
number
of
years
rilke
lived
close
to
rodin
at
rue
de
varenne
in
the
old
mansion
surrounded
by
a
beautiful
park
which
was
subsequently
dedicated
to
france
by
the
artist
and
is
now
the
musée
de
rodin
here
the
young
poet
shared
the
life
of
the
aged
sculptor
and
his
most
silent
hours
rodin
felt
that
rilke
approached
his
sculptures
from
the
same
imaginative
sphere
whence
his
own
creative
impulse
sprang
he
knew
that
in
the
pellucid
and
illuminating
realm
of
the
poetic
his
works
found
their
spiritual
home
as
their
material
manifestation
partook
of
the
atmosphere
when
placed
under
the
open
sky
given
wholly
to
the
sun
and
wind
and
rain
auguste
rodin
work
through
words
sculptors
through
matter
pomponius
gauricus
in
his
essay
de
sculptura
the
hero
is
he
who
is
immovably
centred
rodin
was
solitary
before
fame
came
to
him
and
afterward
he
became
perhaps
still
more
solitary
for
fame
is
ultimately
but
the
summary
of
all
misunderstandings
that
crystallize
about
a
new
name
rodin
message
and
its
significance
are
little
understood
by
the
many
men
who
gathered
about
him
it
would
be
a
long
and
weary
task
to
enlighten
them
nor
is
this
necessary
for
they
assembled
about
the
name
not
about
the
work
a
work
that
has
grown
far
beyond
this
sound
and
limitations
and
that
has
become
nameless
as
a
plain
is
nameless
or
a
sea
that
has
a
name
but
on
the
map
in
books
and
to
men
but
which
is
in
reality
but
distance
movement
and
depth
the
work
that
is
to
be
spoken
of
in
these
pages
developed
through
long
years
it
has
grown
like
a
forest
and
has
not
lost
one
hour
one
walks
among
these
thousand
forms
overwhelmed
with
the
imagination
and
the
craftsmanship
which
they
represent
and
involuntarily
one
looks
for
the
two
hands
out
of
which
this
world
has
risen
one
thinks
of
how
small
man
hands
are
how
soon
they
tire
and
how
little
time
is
given
them
to
move
and
one
longs
to
see
these
hands
that
have
lived
like
a
hundred
hands
like
a
nation
of
hands
that
rose
before
sunrise
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
work
one
asks
for
the
man
who
directs
these
hands
who
is
this
man
he
is
a
man
rich
in
years
and
his
life
is
one
that
can
not
be
related
it
began
and
still
continues
stretches
out
deeply
into
a
great
age
and
to
us
it
seems
as
though
it
had
passed
many
hundreds
of
years
ago
it
perhaps
had
a
childhood
a
childhood
in
poverty
dark
groping
and
uncertain
and
maybe
it
possesses
this
childhood
still
for
says
augustine
somewhere
whither
should
it
have
gone
it
holds
perchance
all
its
past
hours
the
hours
of
expectation
and
abandonment
the
hours
of
doubt
and
the
long
hours
of
need
it
is
a
life
that
has
lost
nothing
and
has
forgotten
nothing
a
life
that
has
absorbed
all
things
as
it
passed
for
only
out
of
such
a
life
as
this
we
believe
could
have
risen
such
fulness
and
abundance
of
work
only
such
a
life
as
this
in
which
everything
is
simultaneous
and
awake
in
which
nothing
passes
unnoticed
could
remain
young
and
strong
and
rise
again
and
again
to
high
creations
perchance
the
time
will
come
when
someone
will
picture
this
life
its
details
its
episodes
and
its
conflicts
someone
will
tell
a
story
of
a
child
that
often
forgot
to
eat
because
it
seemed
more
important
to
him
to
carve
inferior
wood
with
a
cheap
knife
and
someone
will
relate
some
event
of
the
days
of
early
manhood
that
contained
promise
of
future
greatness
one
of
those
incidents
that
are
intimate
and
prophetic
perhaps
some
such
thought
as
that
which
five
hundred
years
ago
a
monk
expressed
to
young
michel
colombe
may
have
suggested
itself
to
rodin
on
one
of
the
crossways
at
the
beginning
of
his
work
travaille

et
tu

and
thou
wilt
have
the
grace
of
the
great
things
for
it
was
just
that
which
rodin
was
seeking
the
grace
of
the
great
things
the
galleries
of
the
louvre
revealed
to
the
young
artist
radiant
visions
of
the
antique
world
visions
of
southern
skies
and
of
the
sea
and
far
beyond
rose
heavy
stone
monuments
reaching
over
from
immemorial
civilizations
into
times
not
yet
existent
there
were
stones
that
lay
as
if
asleep
but
that
held
a
suggestion
that
they
would
awake
on
some
last
judgment
day
stones
on
which
there
was
nothing
mortal
there
were
others
that
bore
a
movement
a
gesture
that
had
remained
as
fresh
as
though
it
had
been
caught
there
in
order
to
be
given
to
some
child
that
was
passing
by
not
alone
in
the
great
works
and
in
these
monuments
was
this
vitality
alive
the
unnoticed
the
small
the
concealed
were
not
less
filled
with
this
deep
inward
excitement
with
this
rich
and
surprising
unrest
of
living
things
even
stillness
where
there
was
stillness
consisted
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
moments
of
motion
that
kept
their
equilibrium
there
were
small
figures
animals
particularly
that
moved
stretched
or
curled
and
although
a
bird
perched
quietly
it
contained
the
element
of
flight
a
sky
grew
back
of
it
and
hung
about
it
the
far
distance
was
folded
down
on
each
of
its
feathers
and
should
these
feathers
spread
out
like
wings
the
wide
expanse
of
them
would
be
quite
great
there
was
stillness
in
the
stunted
animals
that
stood
to
support
the
cornices
of
the
cathedrals
or
cowered
and
cringed
beneath
the
consoles
too
inert
to
bear
the
weight
and
there
were
dogs
and
squirrels
and
lizards
tortoises
rats
and
snakes
at
least
one
of
each
kind
these
creatures
seemed
to
have
been
caught
in
the
open
in
the
forest
and
on
roads
and
the
compulsion
to
live
under
stone
tendrils
flowers
and
leaves
must
have
changed
them
slowly
into
what
they
were
now
and
were
to
remain
forever
but
other
animals
could
be
found
that
were
born
in
this
petrified
environment
without
remembrance
of
a
former
existence
they
were
entirely
the
natives
of
this
erect
rising
steeply
ascending
world
over
arches
they
stood
in
their
fanatic
meagerness
with
mouths
open
like
those
of
pigeons
shrieking
for
the
nearness
of
the
bells
had
destroyed
their
hearing
they
did
not
bear
their
weight
where
they
stood
but
stretched
themselves
and
thus
helped
the
stones
to
rise
the
ones
were
perched
high
up
on
the
balustrades
as
though
they
were
on
the
way
to
other
climes
and
wanted
but
to
rest
a
few
centuries
and
look
down
upon
the
growing
city
others
in
the
forms
of
dogs
were
suspended
horizontally
from
the
eaves
high
up
in
the
air
ready
to
throw
the
rainwater
out
of
their
jaws
that
were
swollen
from
vomiting
all
had
transformed
and
accommodated
themselves
to
this
environment
they
had
lost
nothing
of
life
on
the
contrary
they
lived
more
strongly
and
more
vehemently
lived
forever
the
fervent
anu
impetuous
life
of
the
time
that
had
created
them
and
whosoever
saw
these
figures
felt
that
they
were
not
born
out
of
a
whim
nor
out
of
a
playful
attempt
to
find
forms
unheard
of
before
necessity
had
created
them
out
of
the
fear
of
invisible
doomsdays
of
a
hard
faith
men
had
freed
themselves
by
these
visible
things
from
uncertainty
men
had
taken
refuge
in
this
reality
they
sought
god
no
more
by
inventing
images
of
him
or
by
trying
to
conceive
the
but
they
evinced
their
piety
by
carrying
all
fear
and
poverty
all
anxiety
and
all
pleading
of
the
lowly
into
his
house
this
was
better
than
to
paint
for
painting
was
a
delusion
a
beautiful
and
skillful
deception
men
were
longing
for
the
more
real
and
simple
thus
originated
the
strange
sculpture
of
the
cathedrals
this
of
the
heavy
laden
and
of
the
animals
as
the
young
artist
looked
from
the
plastic
art
of
the
middle
ages
back
to
the
antique
and
again
beyond
the
antique
into
the
beginnings
of
untold
pasts
did
it
not
seem
as
though
the
human
soul
had
longed
again
and
again
through
the
bright
and
dark
periods
of
history
for
this
art
which
expressed
more
than
word
and
painting
more
than
picture
and
symbol
this
art
which
is
the
humble
materialization
of
hopes
and
fears
at
the
end
of
the
renaissance
there
was
the
flowering
of
a
great
plastic
art
at
that
time
when
life
renewed
itself
when
there
was
a
revealment
of
the
secret
of
faces
and
a
great
vital
movement
was
in
the
state
of
growth
and
now
had
not
a
time
come
again
that
was
urging
toward
this
expression
this
strong
and
impressive
exposition
of
what
was
unexpressed
confused
unrevealed
the
arts
somehow
had
renewed
themselves
zeal
and
expectation
filled
and
animated
them
but
perhaps
this
art
the
plastic
art
that
still
hesitated
in
the
fear
of
a
great
past
was
to
be
called
upon
to
find
that
which
the
others
sought
gropingly
and
longingly
this
art
was
to
help
a
time
whose
misfortune
was
that
all
its
conflicts
lay
in
the
invisible
the
language
of
this
art
was
the
body
and
this
body
when
had
one
last
seen
it
strata
after
strata
of
costumes
were
piled
over
it
like
an
ever
renewed
varnish
but
under
this
protecting
crust
the
growing
soul
had
changed
it
and
this
growing
soul
worked
breathlessly
at
remodeling
the
expression
of
die
faces
the
body
had
become
a
different
one
were
it
now
unveiled
it
would
perhaps
reveal
the
imprint
of
a
thousand
new
expressions
as
well
as
the
stamp
of
those
old
mysteries
that
rising
from
the
unconscious
reared
their
dripping
heads
like
strange
out
of
the
singing
blood
and
this
body
could
not
be
less
beautiful
than
that
of
the
antique
it
must
be
of
a
still
higher
beauty
for
two
thousand
years
life
had
held
this
body
in
its
hands
and
had
moulded
it
had
forged
it
now
listening
now
hammering
night
and
day
the
art
of
painting
dreamed
of
this
body
adorned
it
with
light
and
illumined
it
with
twilight
surrounded
it
with
all
softness
and
all
delight
touched
it
like
a
petal
and
in
turn
was
swept
by
it
as
by
a
wave
but
plastic
art
to
which
it
in
truth
belonged
as
yet
of
this
body
knew
nothing
here
was
a
task
as
great
as
the
world
and
he
who
stood
before
it
and
beheld
it
was
unknown
and
struggling
under
the
necessity
of
earning
his
bread
he
was
quite
alone
and
if
he
had
been
a
real
dreamer
he
would
have
dreamed
a
beautiful
and
deep
dream
a
dream
that
no
one
would
have
understood
one
of
those
long
long
dreams
in
which
a
life
could
pass
like
a
day
but
this
young
man
who
worked
in
the
factory
at
sèvres
was
a
dreamer
whose
dream
rose
in
his
hands
and
he
began
immediately
its
realization
he
sensed
where
he
had
to
begin
a
quietude
which
was
in
him
showed
him
the
wise
road
here
already
rodin
deep
harmony
with
nature
revealed
itself
that
harmony
which
the
poet
george
rodenbach
calls
an
elemental
power
and
indeed
it
is
an
underlying
patience
in
rodin
which
renders
him
so
great
a
silent
superior
forbearance
resembling
the
wonderful
patience
and
kindness
of
nature
that
begins
creation
with
a
trifle
in
order
to
proceed
silently
and
steadily
toward
abundant
consummation
rodin
did
not
presume
to
create
the
tree
in
its
full
growth
he
began
with
the
seed
beneath
the
earth
as
it
were
and
this
seed
grew
downward
sunk
deep
its
roots
and
anchored
them
before
it
began
to
shoot
upward
in
the
form
of
a
young
sprout
this
required
time
time
that
lengthened
into
years
one
must
not
hurry
said
rodin
to
the
few
friends
who
gathered
about
him
in
answer
to
their
urgence
at
that
time
the
war
came
and
rodin
went
to
brussels
he
modeled
some
figures
for
private
houses
and
several
of
the
groups
on
the
top
of
the
bourse
and
also
the
four
large
corner
figures
on
the
monument
erected
to
loos
in
the
parc
these
were
orders
which
he
carried
out
conscientiously
without
allowing
his
growing
personality
to
speak
his
real
development
took
place
outside
of
all
this
it
was
compressed
into
the
free
hours
of
the
evening
and
unfolded
itself
in
the
solitary
stillness
of
the
nights
and
he
had
to
bear
this
division
of
his
energy
for
years
he
possessed
the
quiet
perseverance
of
men
who
are
necessary
the
strength
of
those
for
whom
a
great
work
is
waiting
while
he
was
working
on
the
exchange
of
brussels
he
may
have
felt
that
there
were
no
more
buildings
which
admitted
of
the
worth
of
sculpture
as
the
cathedrals
had
done
those
great
magnets
of
plastic
art
of
past
times
sculpture
was
a
separate
thing
as
was
the
easel
picture
but
it
did
not
require
a
wall
like
the
picture
it
did
not
even
need
a
roof
it
was
an
object
that
could
exist
for
itself
alone
and
it
was
well
to
give
it
entirely
the
character
of
a
complete
thing
about
which
one
could
walk
and
which
one
could
look
at
from
all
sides
and
yet
it
had
to
distinguish
itself
somehow
from
other
things
the
ordinary
things
which
everyone
could
touch
it
had
to
become
unimpeachable
sacrosanct
separated
from
chance
and
time
through
which
it
rose
isolated
and
miraculous
like
the
face
of
a
seer
it
had
to
be
given
its
own
certain
place
in
which
no
arbitrariness
had
placed
it
and
it
must
be
intercalated
in
the
silent
continuance
of
space
and
its
great
laws
it
had
to
be
fitted
into
the
space
that
surrounded
it
as
into
a
niche
its
certainty
steadiness
and
loftiness
did
not
spring
from
its
significance
but
from
its
harmonious
adjustment
to
its
environment
rodin
knew
that
first
of
all
sculpture
depended
upon
an
infallible
knowledge
of
the
human
body
slowly
searchingly
he
had
approached
the
surface
of
this
body
from
which
now
a
hand
stretched
out
toward
him
and
the
form
the
gesture
of
this
hand
contained
the
semblance
of
the
force
within
the
body
the
farther
he
progressed
on
this
remote
road
the
more
chance
remained
behind
and
one
law
led
him
on
to
another
and
ultimately
it
was
this
surface
toward
which
his
search
was
directed
it
consisted
of
infinitely
many
movements
the
play
of
light
upon
these
surfaces
made
manifest
that
each
of
these
movements
was
different
and
each
significant
at
this
point
they
seemed
to
flow
into
one
another
at
that
to
greet
each
other
hesitatingly
at
a
third
to
pass
by
each
other
without
recognition
like
strangers
there
were
undulations
without
end
there
was
no
point
at
which
there
was
not
life
and
movement
rodin
had
now
discovered
the
fundamental
element
of
his
art
as
it
were
the
germ
of
his
world
it
was
the
surface
this
differently
great
surface
variedly
accentuated
accurately
measured
out
of
which
everything
must
rise
which
was
from
this
moment
the
subject
matter
of
his
art
the
thing
for
which
he
laboured
for
which
he
suffered
and
for
which
he
was
awake
his
art
was
not
built
upon
a
great
idea
but
upon
a
minute
conscientious
realization
upon
the
attainable
upon
a
craft
there
was
no
haughtiness
in
him
he
pledged
himself
to
a
humble
and
difficult
beauty
that
he
could
oversee
summon
and
direct
the
other
beauty
the
great
beauty
had
to
come
when
everything
was
prepared
as
animals
come
to
a
in
the
forest
in
the
late
night
when
nothing
foreign
is
there
with
this
awakening
rodin
most
individual
work
began
not
until
now
had
all
the
traditional
conceptions
of
plastic
art
become
worthless
to
him
pose
grouping
composition
now
meant
nothing
to
him
he
saw
only
innumerable
living
surfaces
only
life
the
means
of
expression
which
he
had
formed
for
himself
were
directed
to
and
brought
forward
this
aliveness
the
next
task
was
to
become
master
of
himself
and
of
his
abundance
rodin
seized
upon
the
life
that
was
everywhere
about
him
he
grasped
it
in
its
smallest
details
he
observed
it
and
it
followed
him
he
awaited
it
at
the
where
it
lingered
he
overtook
it
as
it
ran
before
him
and
he
found
it
in
all
places
equally
great
equally
powerful
and
overwhelming
there
was
not
one
part
of
the
human
body
that
was
insignificant
or
unimportant
it
was
alive
the
life
that
was
expressed
in
faces
was
easily
readable
life
manifested
in
bodies
was
more
dispersed
greater
more
mysterious
and
more
eternal
here
it
did
not
disguise
itself
it
carried
itself
carelessly
where
there
was
carelessness
and
proudly
with
the
proud
receding
from
the
stage
of
the
face
it
had
taken
off
its
mask
and
concealed
itself
behind
the
scenes
of
garments
here
in
the
body
rodin
found
the
world
of
his
time
as
he
had
recognized
the
world
of
the
middle
ages
in
the
cathedrals
a
universe
gathered
about
this
veiled
mystery
a
world
held
together
by
an
organism
was
adapted
to
this
organism
and
made
subject
to
it
man
had
become
church
and
there
were
thousands
and
thousands
of
churches
none
similar
to
the
other
and
each
one
alive
but
the
problem
was
to
show
that
they
were
all
of
one
god
for
years
rodin
walked
the
roads
of
life
searchingly
and
humbly
as
one
who
felt
himself
a
beginner
no
one
knew
of
his
struggles
he
had
no
confidants
and
few
friends
behind
the
work
that
provided
him
with
necessities
his
growing
work
hid
itself
awaiting
its
time
he
read
a
great
deal
at
this
time
he
might
have
been
seen
in
the
streets
of
brussels
always
with
a
book
in
his
hand
but
perhaps
this
book
was
but
a
pretext
for
the
absorption
in
himself
in
the
gigantic
task
that
lay
before
him
as
with
all
creative
people
the
feeling
of
having
a
great
work
before
him
was
an
incitement
something
that
augmented
and
concentrated
his
forces
and
if
doubts
or
uncertainties
assailed
him
or
he
was
possessed
of
the
great
impatience
of
those
who
rise
or
the
fear
of
an
early
death
or
the
threat
of
daily
want
all
these
influences
found
in
him
a
quiet
erect
resistance
a
defiance
a
strength
and
confidence
all
the
flags
of
a
great
victory
perhaps
it
was
the
past
that
in
such
moments
came
to
his
side
speaking
in
the
voice
of
the
cathedrals
that
he
went
to
hear
again
and
again
in
books
too
he
found
many
thoughts
that
gave
him
encouragement
he
read
for
the
first
time
dante
divina
comedia
it
was
a
revelation
the
suffering
bodies
of
another
generation
passed
before
him
he
gazed
into
a
century
the
garments
of
which
had
been
torn
off
he
saw
the
great
and
judgment
of
a
poet
on
his
age
there
were
pictures
that
justified
him
in
his
ideas
when
he
read
about
the
weeping
feet
of
nicholas
the
third
he
realized
that
there
such
feet
that
there
was
a
weeping
which
was
everywhere
over
the
whole
of
mankind
and
there
were
tears
that
came
from
all
pores
from
dante
he
came
to
baudelaire
here
was
no
judgment
no
poet
who
guided
by
the
hand
of
a
shadow
climbed
to
the
heavens
a
man
who
suffered
had
raised
his
voice
had
lifted
it
high
above
the
heads
of
others
as
though
to
save
them
from
perishing
in
this
poet
verses
there
were
passages
standing
out
prominently
that
did
not
seem
to
have
been
written
but
moulded
words
and
groups
of
words
that
had
melted
under
the
glowing
touch
of
the
poet
lines
that
were
like
reliefs
and
sonnets
that
carried
like
columns
with
interlaced
capitals
the
burden
of
a
cumulating
thought
he
felt
dimly
that
this
poetic
art
where
it
ended
abruptly
bordered
on
the
beginning
of
another
art
and
that
it
reached
out
toward
this
other
art
in
baudelaire
he
felt
the
artist
who
had
preceded
him
who
had
not
allowed
himself
to
be
deluded
by
faces
but
who
sought
bodies
in
which
life
was
greater
more
cruel
and
more
restless
after
having
read
the
works
of
these
two
poets
they
remained
always
near
him
his
thoughts
went
from
them
and
yet
returned
to
them
again
at
the
time
when
his
art
took
form
and
prepared
itself
for
expression
when
life
as
it
presented
itself
before
him
had
little
significance
rodin
dwelt
in
the
books
of
the
poets
and
gleaned
from
the
past
later
when
as
a
creator
he
again
touched
those
realms
their
forms
rose
like
memories
in
his
own
life
aching
and
real
and
entered
into
his
work
as
though
into
a
home
at
last
after
years
of
solitary
labor
he
made
the
attempt
at
a
step
forward
with
one
of
his
creations
it
was
a
question
put
before
the
public
the
public
answered
negatively
and
rodin
retired
once
more
for
thirteen
years
these
were
the
years
during
which
he
still
unknown
matured
to
a
master
and
became
the
absolute
ruler
of
his
own
medium
ever
working
ever
thinking
ever
experimenting
uninfluenced
by
the
age
that
did
not
participate
in
him
perhaps
the
fact
that
his
entire
development
had
taken
place
in
this
undisturbed
tranquility
gave
him
later
when
men
disputed
over
the
value
of
his
work
that
powerful
certainty
at
the
moment
when
they
began
to
doubt
him
he
doubted
himself
no
longer
all
uncertainty
lay
behind
him
his
fate
depended
no
more
upon
the
acclamation
or
the
criticism
of
the
people
it
was
decided
at
the
time
they
thought
to
crush
it
with
mockery
and
hostility
during
the
period
of
his
growth
no
strange
voice
sounded
no
praise
bewildered
no
blame
disturbed
him
as
parsifal
grew
so
his
art
grew
in
purity
alone
with
itself
and
with
a
great
eternal
nature
only
his
work
spoke
to
him
it
spoke
to
him
in
the
morning
when
he
awakened
and
at
even
it
sounded
in
his
hands
like
an
instrument
that
has
been
laid
away
hence
his
work
was
so
invincible
for
it
came
to
the
world
ripe
it
did
not
appear
as
something
unfinished
that
begged
for
justification
it
came
as
a
reality
that
had
wrought
itself
into
existence
a
reality
which
is
which
one
must
acknowledge
like
a
monarch
who
hearing
that
a
city
is
to
be
built
in
his
kingdom
meditates
whether
it
would
be
well
to
grant
the
privilege
and
hesitates
and
finally
goes
forth
to
see
the
place
and
finds
there
a
great
powerful
city
which
is
finished
which
stands
as
though
from
eternity
with
walls
towers
and
gates
so
the
world
came
when
ultimately
called
to
the
completed
work
of
rodin
this
period
of
rodin
maturescence
is
limited
by
two
works
at
its
beginning
stands
the
head
of
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
at
its
end
the
figure
of
the
man
of
the
primal
age
au
nez
cassé
was
refused
by
the
salon
in
the
year
of
one
comprehends
this
rejection
for
one
feels
that
in
this
work
rodin
art
was
mature
certain
and
perfected
with
the
inconsiderateness
of
a
great
confession
it
contradicted
the
requirements
of
academic
beauty
which
were
still
the
dominating
standard
in
vain
rude
had
given
his
goddess
of
rebellion
on
the
top
of
the
triumphal
gate
of
the
place
de
that
wild
gesture
and
that
cry
in
vain
barye
had
created
his
supple
animals
and
the
dance
by
carpeaux
was
merely
an
object
of
mockery
until
finally
it
became
so
accustomed
a
sight
that
it
was
passed
by
unnoticed
the
plastic
art
that
was
pursued
was
still
that
based
upon
models
poses
and
allegories
it
held
to
the
superficial
cheap
and
comfortable
metier
that
was
satisfied
with
the
more
or
less
skillful
repetition
of
some
sanctified
appeal
in
this
environment
the
head
of
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
should
have
roused
the
storm
that
did
not
break
out
until
the
occasion
of
the
exhibition
of
some
later
works
of
rodin
but
probably
it
was
returned
almost
unexamined
as
the
work
of
some
one
unknown
rodin
motive
in
modeling
this
head
the
head
of
an
ageing
ugly
man
whose
broken
nose
even
helped
to
emphasize
the
tortured
expression
of
the
face
must
have
been
the
fulness
of
life
that
was
cumulated
in
these
features
there
were
no
symmetrical
planes
in
this
face
at
all
nothing
repeated
itself
no
spot
remained
empty
dumb
or
indifferent
this
face
had
not
been
touched
by
life
it
had
been
permeated
through
and
through
with
it
as
though
an
inexorable
hand
had
thrust
it
into
fate
and
held
it
there
as
in
the
whirlpool
of
a
washing
gnawing
torrent
when
one
holds
and
turns
this
mask
in
the
hand
one
is
surprised
at
the
continuous
change
of
profiles
none
of
which
is
incidental
imagined
or
indefinite
there
is
on
this
head
no
line
no
exaggeration
no
contour
that
rodin
has
not
seen
and
willed
one
feels
that
some
of
these
wrinkles
came
early
others
later
that
between
this
and
that
deep
furrow
lie
years
terrible
years
one
knows
that
some
of
the
marks
on
this
face
were
engraved
slowly
hesitatingly
that
others
were
traced
gently
and
afterwards
drawn
in
strongly
by
some
habit
or
thought
that
came
again
and
again
one
recognizes
sharp
lines
that
must
have
been
cut
in
one
night
as
though
picked
by
a
bird
in
the
worn
forehead
of
a
sleepless
man
all
these
impressions
are
encompassed
in
the
hard
and
intense
life
that
rises
out
of
this
one
face
as
one
lays
down
this
mask
one
seems
to
stand
on
the
height
of
a
tower
and
to
look
down
upon
the
erring
roads
over
which
many
nations
have
wandered
and
as
one
lifts
it
up
again
it
becomes
a
thing
that
one
must
call
beautiful
for
the
sake
of
its
perfection
but
this
beauty
is
not
the
result
of
the
incomparable
technique
alone
it
rises
from
the
feeling
of
balance
and
equilibrium
in
all
these
moving
surfaces
from
the
knowledge
that
all
these
moments
of
emotion
originate
and
come
to
an
end
in
the
thing
itself
if
one
is
gripped
by
the
tortures
of
this
face
immediately
afterwards
there
comes
the
feeling
that
no
accusation
proceeds
from
it
it
does
not
plead
to
the
world
it
seems
to
carry
its
justice
within
itself
to
hold
the
reconciliation
of
all
its
contradictions
and
to
possess
a
forbearance
great
enough
for
all
its
burden
when
rodin
created
this
mask
he
had
before
him
a
man
who
sat
quiet
with
a
calm
face
but
the
face
was
that
of
a
living
person
and
when
he
searched
through
it
he
saw
that
it
was
as
full
of
motion
as
full
of
unrest
as
the
dashing
of
waves
in
the
course
of
the
lines
there
was
movement
there
was
movement
in
the
contours
of
the
surfaces
shadows
stirred
as
in
sleep
and
light
seemed
to
softly
touch
the
forehead
nothing
possessed
rest
not
even
death
for
decay
too
meant
movement
dead
matter
still
subject
to
life
nature
is
all
motion
and
an
art
that
wished
to
give
a
faithful
and
conscientious
interpretation
of
life
could
not
make
rest
that
did
not
exist
its
ideal
in
reality
the
antique
did
not
hold
such
an
ideal
one
has
only
to
think
of
the
nike
this
piece
of
sculpture
has
not
only
brought
down
to
us
the
movement
of
a
beautiful
maiden
who
goes
to
meet
her
lover
but
it
is
at
the
same
time
an
eternal
picture
of
hellenic
wind
in
all
its
sweep
and
splendour
there
was
no
quiet
even
in
the
stones
of
still
older
civilizations
the
hieratically
retained
gesture
of
very
ancient
cults
contained
an
unrest
of
living
surfaces
like
water
within
a
vessel
there
were
currents
in
the
taciturn
gods
that
were
sitting
and
those
that
were
standing
commanded
with
a
gesture
that
sprang
like
a
fountain
out
from
the
stone
and
fell
back
again
causing
many
ripples
this
was
not
movement
that
opposed
the
intrinsic
character
of
the
sculpture
only
the
movement
that
does
not
complete
itself
within
the
thing
that
is
not
kept
in
balance
by
other
movements
is
that
which
exceeds
beyond
the
boundaries
of
sculpture
the
plastic
work
of
art
resembles
those
cities
of
olden
times
where
the
life
was
spent
entirely
within
the
walls
the
inhabitants
did
not
cease
to
breathe
their
life
ran
on
but
nothing
urged
them
beyond
the
limits
of
the
walls
that
surrounded
them
nothing
pointed
beyond
the
gates
and
no
expectation
opened
a
vista
to
the
outer
world
however
great
the
movement
of
a
sculpture
may
be
though
it
spring
out
of
infinite
distances
even
from
the
depths
of
the
sky
it
must
return
to
itself
the
great
circle
must
complete
itself
the
circle
of
solitude
that
encloses
a
work
of
art
this
was
the
law
which
unwritten
lived
in
the
sculptures
of
times
gone
by
rodin
recognized
it
he
knew
that
that
which
gave
distinction
to
a
plastic
work
of
art
was
its
complete
it
must
not
demand
nor
expect
aught
from
outside
it
should
refer
to
nothing
that
lay
beyond
it
see
nothing
that
was
not
within
itself
its
environment
must
lie
within
its
own
boundaries
the
sculptor
leonardo
has
given
to
gioconda
that
unapproachableness
that
movement
that
turns
inward
that
look
which
one
can
not
catch
or
meet
probably
his
francesco
sforza
contained
the
same
element
it
carried
a
gesture
which
was
like
a
proud
envoy
of
state
who
returned
after
a
completed
commission
during
the
long
years
that
passed
between
the
mask
of
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
and
the
figure
of
the
man
of
primal
times
many
silent
developments
took
place
in
rodin
new
relations
connected
him
more
closely
with
the
past
of
the
art
of
sculpture
and
the
greatness
of
this
past
which
has
been
a
restriction
to
so
many
to
him
had
become
the
wing
that
carried
him
for
if
he
received
during
that
time
an
encouragement
and
confirmation
of
that
which
he
wished
and
sought
it
came
to
him
from
the
art
of
the
antique
world
and
from
the
dim
mystery
of
the
cathedrals
men
did
not
speak
to
him
stones
spoke
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
had
revealed
how
rodin
sought
his
way
through
a
face
the
man
of
primal
times
proved
his
unlimited
supremacy
over
the
body
souverain
tailleur
this
title
which
the
masters
of
the
middle
ages
bestowed
on
one
another
without
envy
and
with
serious
valuation
should
belong
to
him
here
was
a
figure
in
all
parts
of
which
life
was
equally
powerful
and
seemed
to
have
been
elevated
everywhere
to
the
same
height
of
expression
that
which
was
expressed
in
the
face
that
pain
of
a
heavy
awakening
and
at
the
same
time
the
longing
for
that
awakening
was
written
on
the
smallest
part
of
this
body
every
part
was
a
mouth
that
spoke
a
language
of
its
own
the
most
critical
eye
could
not
discover
a
spot
on
this
figure
that
was
the
less
alive
less
definite
and
clear
it
was
as
though
strength
rose
into
the
veins
of
this
man
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
this
figure
was
like
a
silhouette
of
a
tree
that
has
the
storms
of
march
still
before
it
and
trembles
because
the
fruit
and
fulness
of
its
summer
lives
no
more
in
its
roots
but
is
slowly
rising
to
the
trunk
about
which
the
great
winds
will
tear
the
figure
is
significant
in
still
another
sense
it
indicates
in
the
work
of
rodin
the
birth
of
gesture
that
gesture
which
grew
and
developed
to
such
greatness
and
power
here
bursts
forth
like
a
spring
that
softly
ripples
over
this
body
it
awakens
in
the
darkness
of
primal
times
and
in
its
growth
seems
to
flow
through
the
breadth
of
this
work
as
though
reaching
out
from
centuries
to
those
that
are
to
come
hesitatingly
it
unfolds
itself
in
the
lifted
arms
these
arms
are
still
so
heavy
that
the
hand
of
one
rests
upon
the
top
of
the
head
but
this
hand
is
roused
from
its
sleep
it
concentrates
itself
quite
high
on
the
top
of
the
brain
where
it
lies
solitary
it
prepares
for
the
work
of
centuries
a
work
that
has
no
measure
and
no
end
and
the
right
foot
stands
expectant
with
a
first
step
one
would
say
of
this
gesture
that
it
is
wrapped
into
a
hard
bud
in
a
thought
glow
and
a
storm
in
will
it
unfolds
itself
and
that
john
steps
forth
with
excited
speaking
arms
and
with
the
splendid
step
of
one
who
feels
another
follow
him
the
body
of
this
man
is
not
untested
deserts
have
glowed
through
it
hunger
has
made
it
ache
and
all
thirsts
have
tried
it
he
has
endured
and
has
become
hard
his
lean
ascetic
body
is
like
a
forked
piece
of
wood
that
encloses
as
it
were
the
wide
angle
of
his
stride
he
walks
he
walks
as
though
all
distances
of
the
world
were
within
him
and
he
distributed
them
through
his
mighty
step
he
strides
his
arms
speak
of
this
step
his
fingers
spread
and
seem
to
make
the
sign
of
striding
in
the
air
this
john
is
the
first
that
walks
in
the
work
of
rodin
many
follow
the
citizens
of
calais
begin
their
heavy
walk
and
all
walking
seems
to
prepare
for
the
mighty
challenging
step
of
balzac
the
gesture
of
the
standing
figure
develops
further
it
withdraws
into
itself
it
shrivels
like
burning
paper
it
becomes
stronger
more
concentrated
more
animated
that
eve
that
was
originally
to
be
placed
over
the
gates
of
hell
stands
with
head
sunk
deeply
into
the
shadow
of
the
arms
that
draw
together
over
the
breast
like
those
of
a
freezing
woman
the
back
is
rounded
the
nape
of
the
neck
almost
horizontal
she
bends
forward
as
though
listening
over
her
own
body
in
which
a
new
future
begins
to
stir
and
it
is
as
though
the
gravity
of
this
future
weighed
upon
the
senses
of
the
woman
and
drew
her
down
from
the
freedom
of
life
into
the
deep
humble
service
of
motherhood
again
and
again
in
his
figures
rodin
returned
to
this
bending
inward
to
this
intense
listening
to
one
own
depth
this
is
seen
in
the
wonderful
figure
which
he
has
called
la
méditation
and
in
that
immemorable
voix
intérieure
the
most
silent
voice
of
victor
songs
that
stands
on
the
monument
of
the
poet
almost
hidden
under
the
voice
of
wrath
never
was
human
body
assembled
to
such
an
extent
about
its
inner
self
so
bent
by
its
own
soul
and
yet
upheld
by
the
elastic
strength
of
its
blood
the
neck
bent
on
the
lowered
body
rises
and
stretches
and
holds
the
listening
head
over
the
distant
roar
of
life
this
is
so
impressively
and
strongly
conceived
that
one
does
not
remember
a
more
gripping
gesture
or
one
of
deeper
meaning
it
is
striking
that
the
arms
are
lacking
rodin
must
have
considered
these
arms
as
too
facile
a
solution
of
his
task
as
something
that
did
not
belong
to
that
body
which
desired
to
be
enwrapped
within
itself
without
the
aid
of
aught
external
when
one
looks
upon
this
figure
one
thinks
of
duse
in
a
drama
of
when
she
is
painfully
abandoned
and
tries
to
embrace
without
arms
and
to
hold
without
hands
this
scene
in
which
her
body
has
learned
a
caressing
that
reaches
beyond
it
belongs
to
the
unforgettable
moments
in
her
acting
it
conveys
the
impression
that
the
arms
are
something
superfluous
an
adornment
a
thing
of
the
rich
something
immoderate
that
one
can
throw
off
in
order
to
become
quite
poor
she
appeared
in
this
moment
as
though
she
had
forfeited
something
unimportant
rather
like
someone
who
gives
away
his
cup
in
order
to
drink
out
of
the
brook
the
same
completeness
is
conveyed
in
all
the
armless
statues
of
rodin
nothing
necessary
is
lacking
one
stands
before
them
as
before
something
whole
the
feeling
of
incompleteness
does
not
rise
from
the
mere
aspect
of
a
thing
but
from
the
assumption
of
a
pedantry
which
says
that
arms
are
a
necessary
part
of
the
body
and
that
a
body
without
arms
can
not
be
perfect
it
was
not
long
since
that
rebellion
arose
against
the
cutting
off
of
trees
from
the
edge
of
pictures
by
the
impressionists
custom
rapidly
accepted
this
impression
with
regard
to
the
painter
at
least
came
the
understanding
and
the
belief
that
an
artistic
whole
need
not
necessarily
coincide
with
the
complete
thing
that
new
values
proportions
and
balances
may
originate
within
the
pictures
in
the
art
of
sculpture
also
it
is
left
to
the
artist
to
make
out
of
many
things
one
thing
and
from
the
smallest
part
of
a
thing
an
entirety
there
are
among
the
works
of
rodin
hands
single
small
hands
which
without
belonging
to
a
body
are
alive
hands
that
rise
irritated
and
in
wrath
hands
whose
five
bristling
fingers
seem
to
bark
like
the
five
jaws
of
a
dog
of
hell
hands
that
walk
sleeping
hands
and
hands
that
are
awaking
criminal
hands
tainted
with
hereditary
disease
and
hands
that
are
tired
and
will
do
no
more
and
have
lain
down
in
some
corner
like
sick
animals
that
know
no
one
can
help
them
but
hands
are
a
complicated
organism
a
delta
into
which
many
divergent
streams
of
life
rush
together
in
order
to
pour
themselves
into
the
great
storm
of
action
there
is
a
history
of
hands
they
have
their
own
culture
their
particular
beauty
one
concedes
to
them
the
right
of
their
own
development
their
own
needs
feelings
caprices
and
tendernesses
rodin
knowing
through
the
education
which
he
has
given
himself
that
the
entire
body
consists
of
scenes
of
life
of
a
life
that
may
become
in
every
detail
individual
and
great
has
the
power
to
give
to
any
part
of
this
vibrating
surface
the
independence
of
a
whole
as
the
human
body
is
to
rodin
an
entirety
only
as
long
as
a
common
action
stirs
all
its
parts
and
forces
so
on
the
other
hand
portions
of
different
bodies
that
cling
to
one
another
from
an
inner
necessity
merge
into
one
organism
a
hand
laid
on
another
shoulder
or
thigh
does
not
any
more
belong
to
the
body
from
which
it
came
from
this
body
and
from
the
object
which
it
touches
or
seizes
something
new
originates
a
new
thing
that
has
no
name
and
belongs
to
no
one
this
comprehension
is
the
foundation
of
the
grouping
of
figures
by
rodin
from
it
springs
that
coherence
of
the
figures
that
concentration
of
the
forms
that
quality
of
clinging
together
he
does
not
proceed
to
work
from
figures
that
embrace
one
another
he
has
no
models
which
he
arranges
and
places
together
he
starts
with
the
points
of
the
strongest
contact
as
being
the
culminating
points
of
the
work
there
where
something
new
arises
he
begins
and
devotes
all
the
capacity
of
his
chisel
to
the
mysterious
phenomenon
that
accompanies
the
growth
of
a
new
thing
he
works
as
it
were
by
the
light
of
the
flame
that
flashes
out
from
these
points
of
contact
and
sees
only
those
parts
of
the
body
that
are
thus
illuminated
the
spell
of
the
great
group
of
the
girl
and
the
man
that
is
named
the
kiss
lies
in
this
understanding
distribution
of
life
in
this
group
waves
flow
through
the
bodies
a
shuddering
ripple
a
thrill
of
strength
and
a
presaging
of
beauty
this
is
the
reason
why
one
beholds
everywhere
on
these
bodies
the
ecstacy
of
this
kiss
it
is
like
a
sun
that
rises
and
floods
all
with
its
light
still
more
marvelous
is
that
other
kiss
idole
the
material
texture
of
this
creation
encloses
a
living
impulse
as
a
wall
encloses
a
garden
one
of
the
copies
of
this
marble
is
in
the
possession
of
eugène
carrière
and
in
the
silent
twilight
of
his
house
this
stone
pulsates
like
a
spring
in
which
there
is
an
eternal
motion
a
rising
and
falling
a
mysterious
stir
of
an
elemental
force
a
girl
kneels
her
beautiful
body
is
softly
bent
backward
her
right
arm
is
stretched
behind
her
her
hand
has
gropingly
found
her
foot
in
these
three
lines
which
shut
her
in
from
the
outer
world
her
life
lies
enclosed
with
its
secret
the
stone
beneath
her
lifts
her
up
as
she
kneels
there
and
suddenly
in
the
attitude
into
which
the
young
girl
has
fallen
from
idleness
or
reverie
or
solitude
one
recognizes
an
ancient
sacred
symbol
a
posture
like
that
into
which
the
goddess
of
distant
cruel
cults
had
sunk
the
head
of
this
woman
bends
somewhat
forward
with
an
expression
of
indulgence
majesty
and
forbearance
she
looks
down
as
from
the
height
of
a
still
night
upon
the
man
who
sinks
his
face
into
her
bosom
as
though
into
many
blossoms
he
too
kneels
but
deeper
deep
in
the
stone
his
hands
lie
behind
him
like
worthless
and
empty
things
the
right
hand
is
open
one
sees
into
it
from
this
group
radiates
a
mysterious
greatness
one
does
not
dare
to
give
it
one
meaning
it
has
thousands
thoughts
glide
over
it
like
shadows
new
meanings
arise
like
riddles
and
unfold
into
clear
significance
something
of
the
mood
of
a
purgatorio
lives
within
this
work
a
heaven
is
near
that
has
not
yet
been
reached
a
hell
is
near
that
has
not
yet
been
forgotten
here
too
all
splendour
flashes
from
the
contact
of
the
two
bodies
and
from
the
contact
of
the
woman
with
herself
another
conception
of
the
theme
of
the
contact
of
living
surfaces
and
moving
planes
is
that
stupendous
porte
de
on
which
rodin
has
worked
for
twenty
years
and
the
final
casting
into
bronze
of
which
is
imminent
advancing
simultaneously
in
the
pursuit
of
the
import
of
the
movements
of
planes
and
their
points
of
confluence
rodin
came
to
seek
bodies
that
touched
one
another
on
many
points
bodies
whose
movements
were
more
vehement
stronger
and
more
impetuous
the
more
mutual
points
of
contact
two
bodies
offered
the
more
impatiently
they
rushed
upon
each
other
like
chemicals
of
close
affinity
the
tighter
the
new
whole
which
they
formed
held
together
the
more
they
became
like
one
organism
from
the
gates
of
hell
memories
of
dante
emerged
ugolino
the
wandering
ones
dante
and
virgil
close
together
the
throng
of
the
voluptuous
from
among
whom
like
a
dried
up
tree
rose
the
grasping
gesture
of
the
avaricious
the
centaurs
the
giants
and
monsters
the
syrens
fauns
and
wives
of
fauns
all
the
wild
and
ravenous
of
the
forest
rose
before
him
he
conjured
all
the
forms
of
dante
dream
as
though
from
out
the
stirring
depths
of
personal
remembrance
and
gave
them
one
after
another
the
silent
deliverance
of
material
existence
hundreds
of
figures
and
groups
were
thus
created
the
visions
of
the
poet
who
belonged
to
another
age
awakened
the
artist
who
made
them
rise
again
to
the
knowledge
of
a
thousand
other
gestures
gestures
of
seizing
losing
suffering
and
abandoning
and
his
tireless
hands
stretched
out
farther
and
farther
beyond
the
world
of
the
florentine
to
ever
new
forms
and
revelations
this
earnest
worker
who
had
never
sought
for
material
and
who
desired
no
other
fulfilment
than
was
attainable
by
the
increasingly
maturing
mastery
of
his
chisel
thus
penetrated
through
all
the
dramas
of
life
the
depths
of
the
nights
of
love
unfolded
themselves
to
him
and
revealed
the
dark
sorrowful
and
blissful
breadth
of
a
realm
like
that
of
a
still
heroic
world
in
which
there
were
no
garments
in
which
faces
were
extinguished
and
bodies
were
supreme
with
senses
at
white
heat
he
sought
life
in
the
great
chaos
of
this
wrestling
and
what
he
saw
was
life
life
did
not
close
in
about
him
in
sultry
narrowness
the
atmosphere
of
the
alcoves
was
far
away
here
life
became
work
a
thousandfold
life
throbbed
in
every
moment
here
was
loss
and
gain
madness
and
fright
longing
and
sorrow
here
was
a
desire
that
was
immeasurable
a
thirst
so
great
that
all
the
waters
of
the
world
dried
up
in
it
like
a
single
drop
here
was
no
lying
and
denying
and
here
the
joys
of
giving
and
taking
were
genuine
and
great
here
were
the
vices
and
blasphemies
the
damnations
and
the
beatitudes
and
suddenly
it
became
evident
that
a
world
was
poor
that
concealed
or
buried
all
this
life
or
pretended
that
it
did
not
exist
was
alongside
of
the
whole
history
of
mankind
was
this
other
history
that
did
not
know
disguises
conventions
differences
or
ranks
that
only
knew
strife
this
history
too
had
its
evolution
from
an
instinct
it
had
become
a
longing
from
a
physical
possessorship
between
man
and
woman
it
had
become
an
uplifting
desire
of
human
being
for
human
being
thus
this
history
appears
in
the
work
of
rodin
still
the
eternal
struggle
of
the
sexes
but
the
woman
is
no
more
the
overpowered
or
willing
animal
she
is
longing
and
awake
like
the
man
and
both
man
and
woman
seem
to
have
met
in
order
to
find
their
souls
the
man
who
rises
at
night
and
softly
seeks
another
is
like
a
who
wishes
to
find
on
the
of
sex
the
great
happiness
to
discover
in
all
lusts
and
crimes
in
all
trials
and
all
despair
an
infinite
reason
for
existence
is
a
part
of
that
great
longing
that
creates
poets
here
humanity
hungers
for
something
beyond
itself
here
hands
stretch
out
for
eternity
here
eyes
open
see
death
and
do
not
fear
him
here
a
hopeless
heroism
reveals
itself
whose
glory
dawns
and
vanishes
like
a
smile
blossoms
and
withers
like
a
rose
here
are
all
the
storms
of
desire
and
the
calms
of
expectation
here
are
dreams
that
become
deeds
and
deeds
that
fade
into
dreams
here
as
at
a
gigantic
gambling
table
great
fortunes
are
lost
or
won
rodin
work
embodied
all
this
he
who
had
seen
so
much
life
found
here
life
fulness
and
abundance
the
body
each
part
of
which
was
will
the
mouths
that
had
the
form
of
cries
which
seemed
to
rise
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
he
found
the
gestures
of
the
ancient
gods
the
beauty
and
suppleness
of
animals
the
reeling
of
old
dances
the
movements
of
forgotten
divine
services
strangely
combined
with
new
gestures
that
had
originated
during
the
long
period
in
which
art
was
alien
and
blind
to
all
these
relations
these
new
gestures
were
particularly
interesting
to
him
they
were
impatient
as
someone
who
seeks
for
an
object
for
a
long
time
becomes
more
and
more
helpless
confused
and
hasty
and
finally
creates
a
disorder
in
an
accumulation
of
things
about
him
so
the
gestures
of
mankind
who
can
not
find
reason
for
existence
have
become
more
and
more
impatient
nervous
and
hurried
man
movements
have
become
more
hesitating
they
have
no
more
the
athletic
and
resolute
strength
with
which
former
men
grappled
all
things
they
do
not
resemble
those
movements
that
are
preserved
in
ancient
images
those
gestures
of
which
only
the
first
and
the
last
were
important
between
these
two
simple
movements
innumerable
transitions
have
been
interpolated
and
it
is
manifest
that
it
is
just
in
these
intervening
moments
that
the
life
of
the
man
of
passes
by
his
action
and
his
disability
for
action
the
seizing
the
holding
the
abandoning
has
changed
in
everything
there
is
much
more
experience
and
at
the
same
time
more
ignorance
there
is
despondency
and
a
continuous
attack
against
opposition
there
is
grief
over
things
lost
there
is
calculation
judgment
consideration
and
less
spontaneity
rodin
has
discovered
these
gestures
has
evolved
them
out
of
one
or
several
figures
and
moulded
them
into
sculptural
forms
he
has
endowed
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
figures
that
were
only
a
little
larger
than
his
hand
with
the
life
of
all
passions
the
blossoming
of
all
delights
and
the
burden
of
all
vices
he
nas
created
bodies
that
touch
each
other
all
over
and
cling
together
like
animals
bitten
into
each
other
that
fall
into
the
depth
of
oneness
like
a
single
organism
bodies
that
listen
like
faces
and
lift
themselves
like
arms
chains
of
bodies
garlands
and
tendrils
and
heavy
clusters
of
bodies
into
which
sweetness
rises
out
of
the
roots
of
pain
leonardo
only
with
equal
power
has
thus
joined
men
together
in
his
grandiose
representation
of
the
end
of
the
world
in
his
work
as
in
this
are
those
who
throw
themselves
into
the
abyss
in
order
to
forget
the
great
grief
and
those
who
shatter
their
children
heads
lest
they
should
grow
to
experience
the
great
woe
the
army
of
these
figures
became
much
too
numerous
to
fit
into
the
frame
and
wings
of
the
gates
of
hell
rodin
made
choice
after
choice
and
eliminated
everything
that
was
too
solitary
to
subject
itself
to
the
great
totality
everything
that
was
not
quite
necessary
was
rejected
he
made
the
figures
and
groups
find
their
own
places
he
observed
the
life
of
the
people
that
he
had
created
listened
to
them
and
left
every
one
to
his
will
thus
year
after
year
the
world
of
this
gate
grew
its
surface
to
which
plastic
forms
were
attached
began
to
live
and
as
the
reliefs
became
softer
and
softer
the
excitement
of
the
figures
died
away
into
the
surface
in
the
frame
there
is
from
both
sides
an
ascension
a
mutual
uplifting
in
the
wings
of
the
gates
the
predominating
motion
is
a
falling
gliding
and
precipitating
the
wings
recede
somewhat
and
their
upper
edge
is
separated
from
the
projecting
edge
of
the
by
a
large
surface
before
the
silent
closed
room
of
this
surface
is
placed
the
figure
of
the
thinker
the
man
who
realizes
the
greatness
and
terror
of
the
spectacle
about
him
because
he
it
he
sits
absorbed
and
silent
heavy
with
thought
with
all
the
strength
of
an
acting
man
he
thinks
his
whole
body
has
become
head
and
all
the
blood
in
his
veins
has
become
brain
he
occupies
the
center
of
the
gate
above
him
on
the
top
of
the
frame
are
three
male
figures
they
stand
with
heads
bent
together
as
though
overlooking
a
great
depth
each
stretches
out
an
arm
and
points
toward
the
abyss
which
drags
them
ever
downward
the
thinker
must
bear
this
weight
within
himself
among
the
groups
and
figures
that
have
been
modeled
for
this
gate
are
many
of
great
beauty
it
is
impossible
to
enumerate
all
of
them
as
it
is
impossible
to
describe
them
rodin
himself
once
said
that
he
would
have
to
speak
for
one
year
in
order
to
recreate
one
of
his
works
in
words
these
small
figures
which
are
preserved
in
plaster
bronze
and
stone
like
some
animal
figures
of
the
antique
give
the
impression
of
being
quite
large
there
is
in
rodin
studio
the
cast
of
a
panther
a
greek
work
hardly
as
large
as
a
hand
the
original
of
which
is
in
the
cabinet
of
medallions
in
the
national
library
of
paris
as
one
stands
in
front
of
this
beast
and
looks
under
its
body
into
the
room
formed
by
the
four
strong
supple
paws
one
seems
to
look
into
the
depth
of
an
indian
stone
temple
as
this
work
grows
and
extends
itself
to
the
greatness
of
its
suggestion
so
the
small
plastic
figures
of
rodin
convey
the
sense
of
largeness
by
the
play
of
innumerably
many
surfaces
and
by
the
perfect
and
decisive
planes
he
creates
an
effect
of
magnitude
the
atmosphere
about
these
figures
is
like
that
which
surrounds
rocks
an
upward
sweep
of
lines
seems
to
lift
up
the
heavens
the
flight
of
their
fall
to
tear
down
the
stars
at
this
time
perhaps
the
danaide
was
created
a
figure
that
has
thrown
itself
from
a
kneeling
position
down
into
a
wealth
of
flowing
hair
it
is
wonderful
to
walk
slowly
about
this
marble
to
follow
the
long
line
that
curves
about
the
richly
unfolded
roundness
of
the
back
to
the
face
that
loses
itself
in
the
stone
as
though
in
a
great
weeping
and
to
the
hand
which
like
a
broken
flower
speaks
softly
once
more
of
life
that
lies
deep
under
the
eternal
ice
of
the
block
illusion
the
daughter
of
icarus
is
a
luminous
materialization
of
a
long
helpless
fall
the
beautiful
group
that
is
called
et
sa
pensée
is
the
representation
of
a
man
who
kneels
and
with
the
touch
of
his
forehead
upon
the
stone
before
him
awakens
the
silent
form
of
a
woman
who
remains
imprisoned
in
the
stone
in
this
group
one
is
impressed
with
the
expression
of
the
inseparableness
with
which
the
man
thought
clings
to
his
forehead
for
it
is
his
thought
that
lives
and
is
always
present
before
him
the
thought
which
takes
shape
in
the
stone
the
work
most
nearly
related
to
this
in
conception
is
the
head
that
musingly
and
silently
frees
itself
from
a
block
la
pensée
is
a
transcendent
vision
of
life
that
rises
slowly
out
of
the
heavy
sleep
of
the
stone
the
caryatid
is
no
more
the
erect
figure
that
bears
lightly
or
unyieldingly
the
heaviness
of
the
marble
a
woman
form
kneels
crouching
as
though
bent
by
the
burden
the
weight
of
which
sinks
with
a
continuous
pressure
into
all
the
figure
limbs
upon
every
smallest
part
of
this
body
the
whole
stone
lies
like
the
insistence
of
a
will
that
is
greater
older
and
more
powerful
a
pressure
which
it
is
the
fate
of
this
body
to
continue
to
endure
the
figure
bears
its
burden
as
we
bear
the
impossible
in
dreams
from
which
we
can
find
no
escape
even
the
sinking
together
of
the
failing
figure
expresses
this
pressure
and
when
a
greater
weariness
forces
the
body
down
to
a
lying
posture
it
will
even
then
still
be
under
the
pressure
of
this
weight
bearing
it
without
end
such
is
the
caryatid
one
may
always
explain
accompany
and
surround
rodin
works
with
thoughts
for
all
to
whom
simple
contemplation
is
too
difficult
and
unaccustomed
a
road
to
beauty
there
are
other
roads
detours
leading
to
meanings
that
are
noble
great
complete
the
infinite
correctness
of
these
creations
the
perfect
balance
of
all
their
movements
the
wonderful
inward
justice
of
their
proportions
their
penetration
into
life
all
that
makes
them
beautiful
gives
them
the
strength
of
being
unsurpassable
materializations
of
the
ideas
which
the
master
called
into
being
when
he
named
them
rodin
lived
near
his
work
and
like
the
custodian
of
a
museum
continuously
evolved
from
it
new
meanings
one
learns
much
from
his
interpretations
but
in
the
contemplation
of
these
works
alone
and
undisturbed
one
gathers
a
still
fuller
and
richer
understanding
of
them
where
the
first
suggestion
comes
from
some
definite
subject
where
an
ancient
tale
a
passage
from
a
poem
an
historical
scene
or
some
real
person
is
the
inspiration
the
subject
matter
transforms
itself
more
and
more
into
reality
during
the
process
of
the
work
translated
into
the
language
of
the
hands
the
interpretations
acquire
entirely
new
characteristics
which
develop
into
plastic
fulfilment
the
drawings
of
rodin
prepare
the
way
for
the
sculptural
work
by
transforming
and
changing
the
suggestions
in
this
art
too
rodin
has
cultivated
his
own
methods
of
expression
the
individuality
of
these
drawings
there
are
many
hundreds
of
them
presents
an
independent
and
original
manifestation
of
his
artistic
personality
there
are
from
an
earlier
period
water
colours
with
surprisingly
strong
effects
of
light
and
shade
such
as
the
famous
homme
au
taureau
which
reminds
one
of
rembrandt
the
head
of
the
young
jean
baptiste
and
the
shrieking
mask
for
the
genius
of
war
all
these
are
sketches
and
studies
which
helped
the
artist
to
recognize
the
life
of
surfaces
and
their
relationship
to
the
atmosphere
there
are
drawings
that
are
done
with
a
direct
certainty
forms
complete
in
all
their
contours
drawn
in
with
many
quick
strokes
of
the
pen
there
are
others
enclosed
in
the
melody
of
a
single
vibrating
outline
rodin
acceding
to
the
wish
of
a
collector
has
illustrated
with
his
drawings
one
copy
of
the
fleurs
du
mal
to
speak
of
expressing
a
fine
understanding
of
baudelaire
verses
conveys
no
meaning
more
is
conveyed
if
it
is
recalled
that
these
poems
in
their
fulness
do
not
admit
of
supplement
yet
in
spite
of
this
one
feels
an
enhancement
where
rodin
lines
interpret
this
work
such
is
the
measure
of
the
overpowering
beauty
of
these
drawings
the
pen
and
ink
drawing
that
is
placed
opposite
the
poem
la
mort
des
pauvres
exceeds
these
great
verses
with
so
simple
and
a
breadth
of
meaning
that
the
sweep
of
its
lines
seems
to
include
the
universal
this
quality
of
enhancement
is
also
found
in
the
etchings
in
which
the
course
of
infinitely
tender
lines
appears
to
flow
with
an
absolute
accuracy
of
movement
over
the
underlying
essence
of
form
like
the
outer
markings
of
some
beautiful
crystalline
thing
the
strange
documents
of
the
momentary
and
of
the
unnoticeably
passing
originated
at
this
time
rodin
assumed
that
if
caught
quickly
the
simple
movements
of
the
model
when
he
believes
himself
unobserved
contain
the
strength
of
an
expression
which
is
not
surmised
because
one
is
not
wont
to
follow
it
with
intense
and
constant
attention
by
not
permitting
his
eyes
to
leave
the
model
for
an
instant
and
by
allowing
his
quick
and
trained
hand
free
play
over
the
drawing
paper
rodin
seized
an
enormous
number
of
never
before
observed
and
hitherto
unrecorded
gestures
of
which
the
radiating
force
of
expression
was
immense
conjoining
movements
that
had
been
overlooked
and
unrecognized
as
a
whole
represented
and
contained
all
the
directness
force
and
warmth
of
animal
life
a
brush
full
of
ochre
outlined
the
contours
with
quickly
changing
accentuation
modeled
the
enclosed
surface
with
such
incredible
force
that
the
drawing
appears
like
a
figure
in
terra
cotta
and
again
a
new
depth
was
discovered
full
of
unsurmised
life
a
depth
over
which
echoing
steps
had
passed
and
which
gave
its
waters
only
to
him
whose
hands
possessed
the
magic
wand
that
disclosed
its
secret
in
portraiture
the
pictorial
expression
of
the
theme
belonged
to
the
preparation
from
which
rodin
proceeded
slowly
to
the
completion
of
the
work
for
erroneous
as
it
is
to
see
in
rodin
plastic
art
a
kind
of
impressionism
it
is
the
multitude
of
precisely
and
boldly
seized
impressions
that
is
always
the
great
treasure
from
which
he
ultimately
chooses
the
important
and
necessary
in
order
to
comprehend
his
work
in
its
perfect
synthesis
as
he
proceeds
from
the
bodies
to
the
faces
it
must
seem
to
him
as
though
he
stepped
from
a
distance
into
a
room
in
which
many
men
are
gathered
here
everything
is
crowded
and
dim
and
the
mood
of
an
interior
predominates
under
the
arches
of
the
brow
and
in
the
shadows
of
the
mouth
over
the
bodies
there
is
always
change
an
ebb
and
flood
like
the
dashing
of
waves
the
faces
possess
an
atmosphere
like
that
of
rooms
in
which
many
things
have
happened
joyous
and
tragic
incidents
experiences
deadening
or
full
of
expectation
no
event
has
entirely
passed
none
has
taken
the
place
of
the
other
one
has
been
placed
beside
the
other
and
has
remained
there
and
has
withered
like
a
flower
in
a
glass
but
he
who
comes
from
the
open
out
of
the
great
wind
brings
distance
into
the
room
the
mask
of
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
was
the
first
portrait
that
rodin
modeled
in
this
work
his
individual
manner
of
portraying
a
face
is
entirely
formed
one
feels
his
admitted
devotion
to
reality
his
reverence
for
every
line
that
fate
has
drawn
his
confidence
in
life
that
creates
even
where
it
disfigures
in
a
kind
of
blind
faith
he
sculptured
au
nez
cassé
without
asking
who
the
man
was
who
lived
again
in
his
hands
he
made
this
mask
as
god
created
the
first
man
without
intention
of
presenting
anything
save
life
itself
immeasurable
life
but
he
returned
to
the
faces
of
men
with
an
richer
and
greater
knowledge
he
could
not
look
upon
their
features
without
thinking
of
the
days
that
had
left
their
impress
upon
them
without
dwelling
upon
the
army
of
thoughts
that
worked
incessantly
upon
a
face
as
though
it
could
never
be
finished
from
a
silent
and
conscientious
observation
of
life
the
mature
man
at
first
groping
and
experimenting
became
more
and
more
sure
and
audacious
in
his
understanding
and
interpretation
of
the
script
with
which
the
faces
were
covered
he
did
not
give
rein
to
his
imagination
he
did
not
invent
he
did
not
neglect
for
a
moment
the
hard
struggle
with
his
tools
it
would
have
been
easy
to
surmount
as
if
with
wings
these
difficulties
he
walked
side
by
side
with
his
work
over
the
far
and
distant
stretches
that
had
to
be
covered
like
the
behind
his
plough
while
he
traced
his
furrows
he
meditated
over
his
land
the
depth
of
it
the
sky
above
it
the
flights
of
the
winds
and
the
fall
of
the
rains
considered
all
that
existed
and
passed
by
and
returned
and
ceased
not
to
be
he
recognized
in
all
this
the
eternal
and
becoming
less
and
less
perplexed
by
the
many
things
he
perceived
the
one
great
thing
for
which
grief
was
good
and
heaviness
promised
maternity
and
pain
became
beautiful
the
interpretation
of
this
perception
began
with
the
portraits
and
from
that
time
penetrated
ever
deeper
into
his
work
it
is
the
last
step
the
last
cycle
in
his
development
rodin
began
slowly
and
with
infinite
precaution
entered
upon
this
new
road
he
advanced
from
surface
to
surface
following
nature
laws
nature
herself
pointed
out
to
him
as
it
were
the
places
in
which
he
saw
more
than
was
visible
he
evolved
one
great
simplification
out
of
many
confusions
as
christ
brought
unity
into
the
confusion
of
a
guilty
people
by
the
revelation
of
a
sublime
parable
he
fulfilled
an
intention
of
nature
completed
something
that
was
helpless
in
its
growth
he
disclosed
the
coherences
as
a
clear
evening
following
a
misty
day
unveils
the
mountains
which
rise
in
great
waves
out
of
the
far
distance
full
of
the
vital
abundance
of
his
knowledge
he
penetrated
into
the
faces
of
those
that
lived
about
him
like
a
prophet
of
the
future
this
intuitive
quality
gives
to
his
portraits
the
clear
accuracy
and
at
the
same
time
the
prophetic
greatness
which
rises
to
such
indescribable
perfection
in
the
figures
of
victor
hugo
and
of
balzac
to
create
an
image
meant
to
rodin
to
seek
eternity
in
a
countenance
that
part
of
eternity
with
which
the
face
was
allied
in
the
great
course
of
things
eternal
each
face
that
he
has
modeled
he
has
lifted
out
of
the
bondage
of
the
present
into
the
freedom
of
the
future
as
one
holds
a
thing
up
toward
the
light
of
the
sky
in
order
to
understand
its
purer
and
simpler
forms
rodin
conception
of
art
was
not
to
beautify
or
to
give
a
characteristic
expression
but
to
separate
the
lasting
from
the
transitory
to
sit
in
judgment
to
be
just
beside
the
etchings
his
portrait
work
embraces
a
great
number
of
finished
and
masterly
drawings
there
are
busts
in
plaster
in
bronze
in
marble
and
in
heads
and
masks
in
terra
cotta
portraits
of
women
occur
again
and
again
through
all
the
periods
of
his
work
the
famous
bust
of
the
luxembourg
is
one
of
the
earliest
this
bust
is
full
of
individual
life
of
a
certain
beautiful
womanly
charm
but
it
is
surpassed
in
simplicity
and
concentration
by
many
later
works
it
is
perhaps
the
only
bust
which
possesses
a
beauty
not
absolutely
characteristic
of
rodin
work
this
portrait
survives
partly
because
of
a
certain
graciousness
which
has
been
hereditary
for
centuries
in
french
plastic
art
it
shines
somewhat
with
the
elegance
of
the
inferior
sculptures
of
french
tradition
it
is
not
quite
free
from
that
gallant
conception
of
the
belle
femme
beyond
which
the
serious
and
the
deeply
penetrating
work
of
rodin
grew
so
quickly
one
should
remember
that
he
had
to
overcome
the
ancestral
conception
had
to
suppress
an
inborn
capacity
for
this
flowing
grace
in
order
to
begin
his
work
quite
simply
he
must
not
cease
to
be
a
frenchman
the
master
builders
of
the
cathedrals
were
also
frenchmen
his
later
sculptures
of
women
have
a
different
beauty
more
deeply
founded
and
less
traditional
rodin
has
for
the
most
part
executed
portraits
of
foreign
women
especially
american
women
there
are
among
these
busts
some
of
wonderful
craftsmanship
marbles
that
are
like
pure
and
perfect
antique
cameos
faces
whose
smiles
play
softly
over
the
features
like
veils
that
seem
to
rise
and
fall
with
every
breath
strangely
lips
and
eyes
which
seem
to
look
dreamily
into
the
bright
effulgence
of
an
everlasting
moonlit
night
to
rodin
the
face
of
a
woman
seems
to
be
a
part
of
her
beautiful
body
he
conceives
the
eyes
of
the
face
to
be
eyes
of
the
body
and
the
mouth
the
mouth
of
the
body
when
he
creates
both
face
and
body
as
a
whole
the
face
radiates
so
vital
an
expression
of
life
that
these
portraits
of
women
seem
prophetic
the
portraits
of
men
are
different
the
essence
of
a
man
can
be
more
easily
imagined
to
be
concentrated
within
the
limits
of
his
face
there
are
moments
of
calm
and
of
inward
excitement
in
which
all
life
seems
to
have
entered
into
his
face
rodin
chooses
or
rather
creates
these
moments
when
he
models
a
man
portrait
he
searches
far
back
for
individuality
or
character
does
not
yield
to
the
first
impression
nor
to
the
second
nor
to
any
of
those
following
he
observes
and
makes
notes
he
records
almost
unnoticeable
moments
turnings
and
of
many
profiles
from
many
perspectives
he
surprises
his
model
in
relaxation
and
in
effort
in
his
habitual
as
well
as
in
his
impulsive
expressions
he
catches
expressions
which
are
but
suggested
he
comprehends
transitions
in
all
their
phases
knows
from
whence
the
smile
comes
and
why
it
fades
the
face
of
man
is
to
him
like
a
scene
in
a
drama
in
which
he
himself
takes
part
nothing
that
occurs
is
indifferent
to
him
or
escapes
him
he
does
not
urge
the
model
to
tell
him
anything
he
does
not
wish
to
know
aught
save
that
which
he
sees
he
sees
everything
thus
a
long
time
passes
during
the
creation
of
each
work
the
conception
evolves
partly
through
drawings
seized
with
a
few
strokes
of
the
pen
or
a
few
lines
of
the
brush
partly
from
memory
for
rodin
has
trained
his
memory
to
be
a
means
of
assistance
as
dependable
as
it
is
comprehensive
during
the
hours
in
which
the
model
poses
he
perceives
much
more
than
he
can
execute
often
after
the
model
has
left
him
the
real
work
begins
to
take
form
from
out
the
fulness
of
his
memory
the
impressions
do
not
change
within
it
but
accustom
themselves
to
their
and
rise
from
it
into
his
hands
as
though
they
were
the
natural
gestures
of
these
hands
this
manner
of
work
leads
to
an
intense
comprehension
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
moments
of
life
and
such
is
the
impression
produced
by
these
busts
the
many
wide
contrasts
and
the
unexpected
changes
which
comprise
man
and
man
continuous
development
here
join
together
with
an
inner
strength
all
the
heights
and
depths
of
being
all
the
climates
of
temperament
of
these
men
are
concentrated
and
unfold
themselves
on
the
hemispheres
of
their
heads
there
is
the
bust
of
dalou
in
whom
a
nervous
fatigue
vibrates
side
by
side
with
a
tenacious
energy
there
is
henry
rochefort
adventurous
mask
and
there
is
octave
mirabeau
in
whom
behind
a
man
of
action
dawns
a
poet
dream
and
longing
and
puvis
de
chavannes
and
victor
hugo
whom
rodin
knows
so
well
and
there
is
above
all
the
indescribably
beautiful
bronze
portrait
bust
of
the
painter
jean
paul
laurens
which
is
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
luxembourg
museum
this
bust
is
penetrated
by
such
deep
feeling
there
is
such
tender
modeling
of
the
surface
it
is
so
fine
in
carriage
so
intense
in
expression
so
moved
and
so
awake
that
it
seems
as
if
nature
had
taken
this
work
out
of
the
hands
to
claim
it
as
one
of
her
most
precious
possessions
the
gleam
and
sparkle
of
the
metal
that
breaks
like
fire
through
the
patina
coating
adds
much
to
make
perfect
the
unique
beauty
of
this
work
there
is
also
a
bust
of
bastien
lepage
beautiful
and
melancholy
with
the
expression
of
the
suffering
of
the
man
whose
realization
is
a
continuous
departure
from
his
conception
this
bust
was
executed
for
damvillers
the
little
home
village
of
the
painter
and
was
placed
there
in
the
churchyard
as
a
monument
in
their
breadth
of
conception
these
busts
of
rodin
have
something
of
the
monumental
in
them
to
this
quality
is
added
a
greater
simplification
of
the
surfaces
and
a
still
more
severe
choice
of
the
necessary
with
a
view
to
perspective
and
placement
the
monuments
which
rodin
has
created
approach
more
and
more
these
requirements
he
began
with
the
monument
of
claude
gelée
for
nancy
and
there
is
a
steep
ascent
from
this
first
interesting
production
to
the
grandiose
triumph
of
balzac
several
of
the
monuments
by
rodin
were
sent
to
america
the
most
mature
of
them
was
destroyed
during
the
disturbances
in
chile
before
it
reached
its
destination
this
was
the
equestrian
statue
of
general
lynch
like
the
lost
masterpiece
of
leonardo
which
it
resembled
perhaps
in
the
force
of
expression
and
in
the
wonderfully
vital
unity
of
man
and
horse
this
statue
was
not
to
be
preserved
a
small
copy
in
plaster
in
rodin
museum
at
meudon
shows
that
it
was
the
plastic
portrait
of
a
lean
man
who
rises
commandingly
in
his
saddle
not
in
the
brutal
tyrannical
manner
of
a
condottiere
but
with
the
nervous
excitement
of
one
who
exercises
the
power
of
command
only
in
office
but
who
is
not
ordinarily
wont
to
use
this
authority
the
hand
of
the
general
rises
out
of
the
mass
of
the
monument
out
of
man
and
animal
this
gesture
of
command
gives
to
the
statue
of
victor
hugo
its
memorable
power
and
majesty
the
gesture
of
the
aged
man
strong
live
hand
raised
commandingly
toward
the
ocean
does
not
come
from
the
poet
alone
but
descends
from
the
summit
of
the
whole
group
as
though
from
a
mountain
on
which
it
had
prayed
before
it
spoke
victor
hugo
is
here
the
exile
the
solitary
of
guernsey
the
muses
that
surround
him
are
like
thoughts
of
his
solitude
become
visible
rodin
has
conveyed
this
impression
through
the
intensification
and
concentration
of
the
figures
about
the
poet
by
converging
the
points
of
contact
rodin
has
succeeded
in
creating
the
impression
that
these
wonderfully
vibrant
figures
are
parts
of
the
sitting
man
they
move
about
him
like
great
gestures
made
some
time
during
his
life
gestures
that
were
so
beautiful
and
young
that
a
goddess
granted
them
the
grace
not
to
perish
but
to
endure
for
ever
in
the
forms
of
beautiful
women
rodin
made
sketches
and
studies
of
the
figure
of
the
poet
at
the
time
of
the
receptions
in
the
hotel
lusignan
he
observed
from
a
window
and
made
notes
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
movements
and
of
the
changing
expressions
of
the
animated
face
of
the
old
man
these
preparations
resulted
in
the
several
portraits
of
hugo
which
rodin
modeled
the
monument
itself
embodied
a
still
deeper
interpretation
all
these
single
impressions
he
gathered
together
and
as
homer
created
a
perfect
poem
out
of
many
rhapsodies
so
he
created
from
all
the
pictures
in
his
memory
this
one
portrait
and
to
this
last
picture
he
gave
the
greatness
of
the
legendary
it
might
return
to
a
fantastically
towering
rock
in
the
sea
in
whose
strange
forms
peoples
see
life
asleep
the
most
supreme
instance
of
rodin
power
of
exalting
a
past
event
to
the
height
of
the
imperishable
whenever
historical
subjects
or
forms
demand
to
live
again
in
his
art
is
found
perhaps
in
the
citizens
of
calais
the
suggestion
for
this
group
was
taken
from
a
few
passages
in
the
chronicles
of
froissart
that
tell
the
story
of
the
city
of
calais
at
the
time
it
was
besieged
by
the
english
king
edward
the
third
the
king
not
willing
to
withdraw
from
the
city
then
on
the
verge
of
starvation
ultimately
consents
to
release
it
if
six
of
its
most
noble
citizens
deliver
themselves
into
the
hands
that
he
may
do
with
them
according
to
his
will
he
demands
that
they
leave
the
city
clad
only
in
their
shirts
with
a
rope
about
their
necks
and
the
keys
of
the
city
and
of
the
citadel
in
their
hands
the
chronicler
describes
the
scene
in
the
city
he
relates
how
the
burgomaster
messire
jean
de
vienne
orders
the
bells
to
be
rung
and
the
citizens
to
assemble
in
the
market
place
they
hear
the
final
message
and
wait
in
expectation
and
in
silence
then
heroes
rise
among
them
the
chosen
ones
who
feel
the
call
to
die
the
wailing
and
weeping
of
the
multitude
rises
from
the
words
of
the
chronicler
who
seems
to
be
touched
for
the
moment
and
to
write
with
a
trembling
pen
but
he
composes
himself
once
more
and
mentions
four
of
the
heroes
by
name
two
of
the
names
he
forgets
he
says
that
one
man
was
the
wealthiest
citizen
of
the
city
and
that
another
possessed
authority
and
wealth
and
had
two
beautiful
maidens
for
daughters
of
the
third
he
only
knows
that
he
was
rich
in
possessions
and
heritage
and
of
the
fourth
that
he
was
the
brother
of
the
third
he
reports
that
they
removed
all
their
clothing
save
their
shirts
that
they
tied
ropes
about
their
necks
and
thus
departed
with
the
keys
of
the
city
and
of
the
citadel
he
tells
how
they
came
to
the
king
camp
and
of
how
harshly
the
king
received
them
and
how
the
executioner
stood
beside
them
when
the
king
at
the
request
of
the
queen
gave
them
back
their
lives
he
listened
to
his
wife
says
froissart
because
she
was
very
pregnant
the
chronicle
does
not
continue
further
for
rodin
this
was
sufficient
material
he
felt
immediately
that
there
was
a
moment
in
this
story
when
something
portentous
took
place
something
independent
of
time
and
place
something
simple
something
great
he
concentrated
all
his
attention
upon
the
moment
of
the
departure
he
saw
how
the
men
started
on
their
way
he
felt
how
through
each
one
of
them
pulsated
once
more
his
entire
past
life
he
realized
how
each
one
stood
there
prepared
to
give
that
life
for
the
sake
of
the
old
city
six
men
rose
before
him
of
whom
no
two
were
alike
only
two
brothers
were
among
them
between
whom
there
was
possibly
a
certain
similarity
but
each
of
them
had
resolved
to
live
his
last
hour
in
his
own
way
to
celebrate
it
with
his
soul
and
to
suffer
for
it
with
his
body
which
clung
to
life
rodin
then
no
longer
saw
the
forms
of
these
men
gestures
rose
before
him
gestures
of
renunciation
of
farewell
of
resignation
gestures
over
gestures
he
gathered
them
together
and
gave
them
form
they
thronged
about
him
out
of
the
fulness
of
his
knowledge
a
hundred
heroes
rose
in
his
memory
and
demanded
to
be
sacrificed
and
he
concentrated
this
hundred
into
six
he
modeled
them
each
by
himself
in
heroic
size
to
represent
the
greatness
of
their
resolution
modeled
them
nude
in
the
appeal
of
their
shivering
bodies
he
created
the
old
man
with
hanging
arms
and
heavy
dragging
step
and
gave
him
the
walk
of
old
men
and
an
expression
of
weariness
that
flows
over
his
face
into
the
beard
he
created
the
man
that
carries
the
key
the
man
who
would
have
lived
for
many
years
to
come
but
whose
life
is
condensed
into
this
sudden
last
hour
which
he
can
hardly
bear
his
lips
are
tightly
pressed
together
his
hands
bite
into
the
key
there
is
fire
in
his
strength
and
it
burns
in
his
defiant
bearing
he
created
the
man
who
holds
his
bent
head
with
both
hands
to
compose
himself
to
be
once
more
alone
he
created
the
two
brothers
one
of
whom
looks
backward
while
the
other
bends
his
head
with
a
movement
of
resolution
and
submission
as
though
he
offered
it
to
the
executioner
he
created
the
man
with
the
vague
gesture
whom
gustave
geffroy
has
called
le
passant
this
man
moves
forward
but
he
turns
back
once
more
not
to
the
city
not
to
those
who
are
weeping
and
not
to
those
who
go
with
him
he
turns
back
to
himself
his
right
arm
is
raised
bent
vacillating
his
hands
open
in
the
air
as
though
to
let
something
go
as
one
gives
freedom
to
a
bird
this
gesture
is
symbolic
of
a
departure
from
all
uncertainty
from
a
happiness
that
has
not
yet
been
from
a
grief
that
will
now
wait
in
vain
from
men
who
live
somewhere
and
whom
he
might
have
met
some
time
from
all
possibilities
of
and
the
day
after
and
from
death
which
he
had
thought
far
distant
that
he
had
imagined
would
come
mildly
and
softly
and
at
the
end
of
a
long
long
time
this
figure
if
placed
by
itself
in
a
dim
old
garden
would
be
a
monument
for
all
who
have
died
young
thus
rodin
has
made
each
of
these
men
live
again
the
last
concentrated
moment
of
life
each
figure
is
majestic
in
its
simple
greatness
they
bring
to
mind
donatello
and
perhaps
claux
sluter
and
his
prophets
in
the
chartreuse
of
dijon
it
seems
at
first
as
though
rodin
had
done
nothing
more
than
gather
them
together
he
has
given
them
the
same
attire
the
shirt
and
the
rope
and
has
placed
them
together
in
two
rows
the
three
that
are
in
the
first
row
are
about
to
start
forward
the
other
three
turn
to
the
right
and
follow
behind
the
place
that
was
decided
upon
for
the
erection
of
the
monument
was
the
market
place
of
calais
the
same
spot
from
which
the
tragic
procession
had
formerly
started
there
the
silent
group
was
to
stand
raised
by
a
low
step
above
the
common
life
of
the
market
place
as
though
the
fearful
departure
were
always
pending
the
city
of
calais
refused
to
accept
a
low
pedestal
because
it
was
contrary
to
custom
rodin
then
suggested
that
a
square
tower
two
stories
high
and
with
walls
be
built
near
the
ocean
and
there
the
six
citizens
should
be
placed
surrounded
by
the
solitude
of
the
wind
and
the
sky
this
plan
as
might
have
been
expected
was
declined
although
it
was
in
harmony
with
the
character
of
the
work
if
the
trial
had
been
made
there
would
have
been
an
incomparable
opportunity
for
observing
the
unity
of
the
group
which
although
it
consisted
of
single
figures
held
closely
together
as
a
whole
the
figures
do
not
touch
one
another
but
stand
side
by
side
like
the
last
trees
of
a
forest
united
only
by
the
surrounding
atmosphere
from
every
point
of
view
the
gestures
stand
out
clear
and
great
from
the
dashing
waves
of
the
contours
they
rise
and
fall
back
into
the
mass
of
stone
like
flags
that
are
furled
the
entire
impression
of
this
group
is
precise
and
clear
like
all
of
rodin
compositions
this
one
too
appears
to
be
a
pulsating
world
enclosed
within
its
own
boundaries
beside
the
points
of
actual
contact
there
is
a
kind
of
contact
produced
by
the
surrounding
atmosphere
which
diminishes
influences
and
changes
the
character
of
the
group
contact
may
exist
between
objects
far
distant
from
one
another
like
the
conflux
of
forms
such
as
one
sees
sometimes
in
masses
of
clouds
where
the
interjacent
air
is
no
separating
abyss
but
rather
a
transition
a
conjunction
to
rodin
the
participation
of
the
atmosphere
in
the
composition
has
always
been
of
greatest
importance
he
has
adapted
all
his
figures
surface
after
surface
to
their
particular
space
and
environment
this
gives
them
the
greatness
and
independence
the
marvelous
completeness
and
life
which
distinguishes
them
from
all
other
works
when
interpreting
nature
he
found
as
he
intensified
an
expression
that
at
the
same
time
he
enhanced
the
relationship
of
the
atmosphere
to
his
work
to
such
a
degree
that
the
surrounding
air
seemed
to
give
more
life
more
passion
as
it
were
to
the
embraced
surfaces
a
similar
effect
may
be
observed
in
some
of
the
animals
on
the
cathedrals
to
which
the
air
relates
itself
in
strange
fashion
it
seems
to
become
calm
or
storm
according
to
whether
it
sweeps
over
emphasized
or
level
surfaces
when
rodin
concentrates
the
surfaces
of
his
works
into
culminating
points
when
he
uplifts
to
greater
height
the
exalted
or
gives
more
depth
to
a
cavity
he
creates
an
effect
like
that
which
atmosphere
produces
on
monuments
that
have
been
exposed
to
it
for
centuries
the
atmosphere
has
traced
deeper
lines
upon
these
monuments
has
shadowed
them
with
veils
of
dust
has
seasoned
them
with
rain
and
frost
with
sun
and
storm
and
has
thus
endowed
them
with
endurance
so
that
they
may
remain
imperishable
through
many
dusks
and
dawn
this
effect
of
atmosphere
which
is
the
monumental
principle
of
rodin
art
is
wonderfully
achieved
in
the
citizens
of
calais
these
sculptural
forms
seen
from
a
distance
are
not
only
surrounded
by
the
immediate
atmosphere
but
by
the
whole
sky
they
catch
on
their
surfaces
as
with
a
mirror
its
moving
distances
so
that
a
great
gesture
seems
to
live
and
to
force
space
to
participate
in
its
movement
this
impression
is
conveyed
also
by
the
figure
of
the
slender
youth
who
kneels
with
outstretched
imploring
arms
rodin
has
called
this
figure
the
prodigal
son
but
it
has
recently
received
the
name
from
whom
or
from
whence
no
one
knows
of
prière
the
gesture
of
this
figure
raises
it
even
beyond
this
name
this
is
no
son
kneeling
before
his
father
a
god
is
necessary
to
him
who
thus
implores
and
in
him
are
all
who
need
this
god
this
prayer
in
stone
reaches
out
to
such
distance
that
the
figure
seems
to
be
withdrawn
into
a
great
isolation
such
too
is
the
balzac
to
whom
rodin
has
given
a
greatness
which
perhaps
overtowers
the
figure
of
the
writer
rodin
has
seized
upon
the
essence
of
balzac
being
has
not
confined
himself
to
the
limitations
of
his
personality
but
has
gone
beyond
into
his
most
extreme
and
distant
possibilities
these
mighty
contours
might
have
been
formed
in
the
tombstones
of
nations
for
years
rodin
was
entirely
absorbed
in
this
figure
he
visited
balzac
home
he
went
to
the
landscapes
of
the
touraine
that
rise
continually
in
balzac
books
he
read
his
letters
he
studied
the
portraits
of
balzac
and
he
read
his
works
again
and
again
on
all
the
intricate
and
intertwining
roads
of
these
works
he
was
met
by
the
people
of
balzac
whole
families
and
generations
a
world
that
still
seemed
to
receive
life
from
its
creator
rodin
saw
that
all
these
thousands
of
people
no
matter
what
their
occupation
or
their
life
contained
him
who
had
created
them
as
one
may
perceive
the
character
and
the
mood
of
a
play
through
the
faces
of
an
audience
so
he
sought
in
all
these
faces
him
who
still
lived
in
them
he
believed
like
balzac
in
the
reality
of
his
world
and
he
became
for
a
time
a
part
of
it
he
lived
as
though
balzac
had
created
him
also
and
he
dwelt
unnoticed
among
the
multitude
of
his
people
thus
he
gathered
his
impressions
the
actual
world
appeared
at
this
time
vague
and
unimportant
the
daguerreotypes
of
balzac
offered
only
general
suggestions
and
nothing
new
the
face
which
they
represented
was
the
one
he
had
known
from
boyhood
days
the
one
that
had
been
in
the
possession
of
stéphan
mallarmé
which
showed
balzac
without
coat
and
suspenders
was
the
only
one
which
was
more
characteristic
reminiscences
of
contemporaries
helped
him
the
words
of
théophile
gautier
the
notes
of
the
goncourts
and
the
beautiful
essay
by
lamartine
beside
these
pen
portraits
there
was
only
the
bust
by
david
in
the
comédie
française
and
a
small
picture
by
louis
boulanger
completely
filled
with
the
spirit
of
balzac
rodin
with
the
aid
of
these
auxiliaries
began
to
model
the
figure
of
the
writer
he
used
living
models
of
similar
proportions
and
completed
seven
perfectly
executed
portraits
in
different
positions
the
models
were
men
with
heavy
limbs
and
short
arms
after
these
studies
he
created
a
balzac
much
like
the
one
in
nadar
daguerreotype
but
he
felt
this
was
not
final
he
returned
to
the
description
of
lamartine
to
the
lines
he
had
the
face
of
an
element
and
he
possessed
so
much
soul
that
his
heavy
body
seemed
not
to
exist
rodin
felt
that
a
great
part
of
his
task
was
suggested
in
these
sentences
he
approached
nearer
its
solution
by
dothing
the
seven
figures
with
monk
cowls
the
kind
of
garment
that
balzac
was
wont
to
wear
while
at
work
he
created
a
balzac
with
a
hood
a
garb
much
too
intimate
the
figure
much
too
retired
into
the
stillness
of
its
disguise
rodin
slowly
developed
form
after
form
at
last
he
saw
balzac
he
saw
a
mighty
striding
figure
that
lost
all
its
heaviness
in
the
fall
of
its
ample
cloak
the
hair
brisded
from
the
nape
of
the
powerful
neck
and
backward
against
the
thick
locks
leaned
the
face
of
a
visionary
in
the
intoxication
of
his
dream
a
face
flashing
with
creative
force
the
face
of
an
element
this
was
balzac
in
the
fulness
of
his
productivity
the
founder
of
generations
the
waster
of
fates
this
was
the
man
whose
eyes
were
those
of
a
seer
whose
visions
would
have
filled
the
world
had
it
been
empty
this
was
the
balzac
that
creation
itself
had
formed
to
manifest
itself
and
who
was
creation
boastfulness
vanity
ecstasy
and
intoxication
the
head
crowned
the
summit
of
this
figure
as
lightly
as
a
ball
is
upheld
by
the
spray
of
a
fountain
there
was
no
sense
of
weight
but
a
magnificent
vitality
in
the
free
strong
head
rodin
had
seen
in
a
moment
of
large
comprehension
and
tragic
exaggeration
his
balzac
and
thus
he
created
him
the
vision
did
not
fade
it
only
changed
the
comprehensiveness
which
gave
breadth
to
rodin
monumental
works
gave
to
the
others
also
a
new
beauty
it
gave
them
a
peculiar
nearness
there
are
among
the
more
recent
works
small
groups
that
are
striking
because
of
their
concentration
and
the
wonderful
treatment
of
the
marble
the
stones
preserve
even
in
the
midst
of
the
day
that
mysterious
shimmer
which
white
things
exhale
in
the
twilight
this
radiance
is
not
the
result
of
the
vibrant
quality
of
the
points
of
contact
alone
but
is
due
in
part
to
the
flat
ribbands
of
stone
that
lie
between
the
figures
like
small
bridges
which
connect
one
form
with
the
other
over
the
deepest
clefts
in
the
modeling
these
ribband
fillings
are
not
incidental
but
are
placed
there
to
prevent
too
sharp
an
outline
they
preserve
in
the
forms
that
otherwise
would
appear
too
clear
cut
an
effect
of
roundness
they
gather
the
light
like
vases
that
gently
and
continuously
overflow
when
rodin
seeks
to
condense
the
atmosphere
about
the
surfaces
of
his
works
the
stone
appears
to
almost
dissolve
in
the
air
the
marble
is
the
compact
fruitful
kernel
and
its
last
softest
contour
the
vibrating
air
the
light
touching
the
marble
loses
its
will
it
does
not
penetrate
into
the
stone
but
nestles
close
lingers
dwells
in
the
stone
this
closing
up
of
unessential
clefts
is
an
approach
to
the
relief
rodin
planned
a
great
work
in
relief
in
which
there
were
to
be
effects
of
light
such
as
he
achieved
in
the
smaller
groups
he
constructed
a
column
about
which
a
broad
ribband
of
relief
winds
upward
this
encircling
ribband
conceals
a
staircase
which
ascends
under
arched
vaultings
the
figures
in
this
ascending
relief
are
modeled
and
placed
so
as
to
receive
an
effect
of
life
and
vibrance
from
the
atmosphere
and
lighting
a
plastic
art
will
some
time
rise
which
will
disclose
the
secret
of
twilight
as
it
is
related
to
those
sculptures
that
stand
in
the
vestibules
of
old
cathedrals
this
monument
of
work
represents
a
history
of
work
which
develops
upon
these
slowly
rising
reliefs
the
long
line
begins
in
a
lower
chamber
or
crypt
with
the
figures
of
those
who
have
grown
old
in
mines
the
procession
traces
its
steps
through
all
the
phases
of
work
from
those
who
work
in
the
roar
and
red
glow
of
furnaces
to
those
who
work
in
silence
in
the
light
of
a
great
idea
from
the
hammers
to
the
brains
two
figures
guard
the
entrance
day
and
night
and
upon
the
summit
of
this
tower
stand
two
winged
forms
to
symbolize
the
blessings
descending
from
the
luminous
heights
rodin
did
not
conceive
work
as
a
monumental
figure
or
a
great
gesture
for
work
is
something
near
it
takes
place
in
the
shops
in
the
rooms
in
the
heads
in
the
dark
he
knows
for
he
too
worked
he
worked
incessantly
his
life
passed
like
a
single
working
day
rodin
had
several
studios
some
that
are
in
which
visitors
and
letters
found
him
there
were
others
in
secluded
places
of
which
no
one
knew
these
rooms
were
like
cells
bare
poor
and
grey
with
dust
but
their
poverty
was
like
the
great
grey
poverty
of
god
out
of
which
trees
bud
in
march
something
of
the
spring
was
in
each
of
these
rooms
a
silent
promise
and
a
deep
seriousness
in
one
of
these
studios
the
tower
of
work
has
risen
now
that
it
is
accomplished
it
is
time
to
speak
of
its
significance
some
time
after
this
monument
has
been
erected
it
will
be
recognized
that
rodin
willed
nothing
that
was
beyond
his
art
the
body
of
work
here
manifests
itself
as
did
formerly
the
body
of
love
it
is
a
new
revelation
of
life
this
creator
lived
so
completely
in
his
conceptions
so
entirely
in
the
depths
of
his
work
that
inspiration
or
revelation
came
to
him
only
through
the
medium
of
his
art
new
life
in
the
ultimate
sense
meant
to
him
new
surfaces
new
gestures
thus
to
him
the
meaning
of
life
became
simple
he
could
err
no
more
with
his
own
development
rodin
has
given
an
impetus
to
all
the
arts
in
this
confused
age
some
time
it
will
be
realized
what
has
made
this
great
artist
so
supreme
he
was
a
worker
whose
only
desire
was
to
penetrate
with
all
his
forces
into
the
humble
and
difficult
significance
of
his
tools
therein
lay
a
certain
renunciation
of
life
but
in
just
this
renunciation
lay
his
triumph
for
life
entered
into
his
work
