man
of
the
a
girl
in
crumpled
linen
slacks
skidded
to
a
fast
stop
on
the
polished
floor
of
the
business
office
with
a
flourish
she
pushed
a
slip
of
paper
through
the
bars
of
the
treasurer
cage
she
grinned
beguilingly
at
the
man
who
was
totaling
a
long
column
of
figures
top
o
the
morning
peters
she
chirped
how
about
cashing
a
little
check
for
me
the
tired
looking
man
peered
carefully
at
the
crisp
rectangle
of
paper
regretfully
he
shook
his
head
sorry
miss
parker
i
like
to
do
it
but
orders
are
orders
your
father
said
i
was
to
pass
out
a
penny
without
his
okay
but
i
stony
broke
i
destitute
the
blue
eyes
became
eloquent
pleading
my
allowance
does
come
due
for
another
ten
days
why
not
talk
it
over
with
your
father
penny
retrieved
the
check
and
tore
it
to
bits
i
already
worked
on
dad
until
i
blue
in
the
face
she
grumbled
talking
to
a
mountain
gives
one
a
lot
more
satisfaction
now
you
know
your
father
gives
you
almost
everything
you
want
the
treasurer
teased
you
have
a
car
of
your
own
and
no
gas
to
run
it
penny
cut
in
why
i
work
like
a
galley
slave
helping
dad
build
up
the
circulation
of
this
newspaper
you
have
brought
the
many
new
subscribers
peters
agreed
warmly
i
always
remember
that
fine
story
you
wrote
about
the
vanishing
houseboat
mystery
it
was
one
of
the
best
this
paper
ever
published
what
the
use
of
being
the
talented
only
daughter
of
a
prosperous
newspaper
owner
if
you
ca
cash
in
on
it
now
and
then
penny
went
on
why
the
coffers
of
this
old
paper
fairly
drip
gold
but
do
i
ever
get
any
of
it
i
let
you
have
a
few
dollars
peters
offered
unexpectedly
enough
to
tide
you
over
until
the
day
your
allowance
falls
due
you
see
i
know
how
it
is
because
i
have
a
daughter
of
my
own
penny
chubby
freckled
face
brightened
then
the
light
faded
she
asked
doubtfully
you
do
intend
to
give
me
the
money
out
of
your
own
pocket
mr
peters
why
yes
i
would
dare
go
against
your
father
orders
penny
he
said
no
more
of
your
checks
were
to
be
cashed
without
his
approval
unfolding
several
crisp
new
bills
from
his
wallet
the
treasurer
offered
them
to
penny
she
gazed
at
the
money
with
deep
longing
then
firmly
pushed
it
back
thanks
peters
but
it
has
to
be
dad
money
or
none
you
see
i
have
a
strict
code
of
honor
sorry
replied
the
treasurer
i
like
to
help
you
oh
i
struggle
on
somehow
with
a
deep
sigh
penny
turned
away
from
the
cage
she
was
a
slim
girl
whose
enthusiasms
often
carried
her
into
trouble
her
mother
was
dead
but
though
she
had
been
raised
by
weems
a
faithful
housekeeper
she
was
not
in
the
least
spoiled
nevertheless
because
her
father
anthony
parker
publisher
of
the
was
indulgent
she
usually
had
her
way
about
most
matters
from
him
she
had
learned
many
details
of
the
newspaper
business
in
fact
having
a
flare
for
reporting
she
had
written
many
of
the
paper
finest
stories
penny
was
a
friendly
loveable
little
person
not
for
long
could
she
remain
downhearted
as
she
walked
down
the
long
hallway
its
great
expanse
of
polished
floor
suddenly
looked
as
inviting
as
an
ice
pond
with
a
quick
little
run
she
slid
its
length
and
at
the
elevator
corner
she
collided
with
a
bent
old
man
who
hobbled
along
on
a
crooked
hickory
cane
oh
i
terribly
sorry
penny
apologized
i
did
know
anyone
was
coming
i
should
have
taken
this
hall
on
high
the
unexpected
collision
had
winded
the
old
man
he
staggered
a
step
backwards
and
penny
grasped
his
arm
to
offer
support
she
could
not
fail
to
stare
never
before
in
the
office
had
she
seen
such
a
queer
looking
old
fellow
he
wore
coarse
garments
with
heavy
boots
his
hair
snow
white
had
not
been
cut
in
many
weeks
the
grotesque
effect
was
heightened
by
a
straw
hat
several
sizes
too
small
which
was
perched
atop
his
head
i
sorry
penny
repeated
i
guess
i
did
know
where
i
was
going
like
we
is
in
the
same
boat
miss
replied
the
old
man
in
a
cracked
voice
as
how
i
do
know
where
i
goin
my
own
self
then
perhaps
i
can
help
you
are
you
looking
for
someone
in
this
building
the
old
man
took
a
grimy
sheet
of
paper
from
a
tattered
coat
pocket
i
want
to
find
the
feller
who
will
print
this
advertisement
for
me
he
explained
carefully
i
want
everybody
who
takes
the
newspaper
to
read
it
i
got
cash
money
to
pay
for
it
too
he
drew
a
greasy
bill
from
an
ancient
wallet
and
waved
it
proudly
before
penny
ye
see
miss
i
got
cash
money
i
ai
no
moocher
penny
hid
a
smile
not
only
did
the
old
man
look
queer
but
his
conversation
was
equally
quaint
she
thought
that
he
must
come
from
an
isolated
hill
community
many
miles
distant
i
show
you
the
way
to
the
ad
department
she
offered
guiding
him
down
the
hall
i
see
you
have
your
advertisement
written
out
yes
miss
the
old
man
hobbled
along
beside
her
my
old
woman
wrote
it
all
down
she
was
well
edijikated
before
we
got
hitched
proudly
he
offered
penny
the
paper
which
bore
several
lines
of
neatly
inscribed
script
the
advertisement
long
and
awkwardly
worded
offered
for
sale
an
old
spinning
wheel
an
ancient
loom
and
a
set
of
wool
carders
my
old
woman
used
to
be
one
o
the
best
weavers
in
hobostein
county
the
old
man
explained
with
pride
she
could
make
a
man
a
pair
o
jeans
that
wear
like
they
had
growed
to
his
hide
but
they
ai
no
call
for
real
weavin
no
more
everything
is
cheapened
down
machine
stuff
these
days
where
is
your
home
penny
questioned
curiously
me
and
my
old
woman
was
born
and
raised
in
the
red
river
valley
ever
been
there
no
i
ca
say
i
have
it
one
of
the
purtiest
spots
god
ever
made
the
old
man
said
proudly
you
never
seen
such
green
pastures
an
the
hills
kinda
take
your
breath
away
only
at
night
there
strange
creatures
trackin
through
the
woods
and
some
says
there
haunts
penny
glanced
quickly
at
her
companion
haunts
she
inquired
before
the
old
man
could
answer
they
had
reached
the
counter
an
employee
of
the
paper
immediately
appeared
to
accept
the
advertisement
his
questions
as
he
counted
words
and
assessed
charges
bewildered
the
old
hillman
penny
supplied
the
answers
as
best
she
could
however
in
her
haste
to
be
finished
with
the
task
she
forgot
to
have
the
old
fellow
leave
name
and
address
you
were
saying
something
about
haunts
she
reminded
him
eagerly
as
they
walked
away
from
the
desk
you
do
really
believe
in
ghosts
do
you
mister
silas
malcom
the
old
man
supplied
that
my
name
and
there
ai
a
better
one
in
hobostein
county
so
you
be
interested
in
haunts
well
yes
i
am
penny
admitted
her
eyes
dancing
i
like
all
types
of
mystery
just
lead
me
to
it
well
here
something
that
will
make
your
pretty
eyes
pop
chuckling
the
old
man
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
worn
newspaper
clipping
penny
saw
that
it
had
been
clipped
from
the
hobostein
county
weekly
it
read
five
hundred
dollars
reward
offered
for
any
information
leading
to
the
capture
of
the
headless
horseman
for
particulars
see
burmaster
sleepy
hollow
this
a
strange
advertisement
penny
commented
aloud
the
only
headless
horseman
to
my
knowledge
was
the
famous
galloping
hessian
in
the
story
of
sleepy
hollow
but
in
reality
such
things
exist
maybe
not
said
the
old
man
but
we
got
one
in
the
valley
just
the
same
an
if
what
folks
says
is
so
that
headless
horseman
likely
to
make
a
heap
o
trouble
fer
someone
before
he
through
his
hauntin
penny
stared
soberly
into
the
twinkling
blue
eyes
of
her
aged
companion
as
a
character
he
completely
baffled
her
did
he
mean
what
he
said
or
was
he
merely
trying
to
lead
her
on
with
hints
of
mystery
at
any
rate
the
bait
was
too
tempting
to
resist
tell
me
more
she
urged
exactly
what
do
you
know
about
this
advertisement
nothin
nary
a
thing
miss
but
there
haunts
at
sleepy
hollow
and
do
you
think
there
ai
i
seen
myself
from
witching
rock
and
where
is
witching
rock
even
the
words
intrigued
penny
jest
a
place
on
humpy
hill
lookin
down
over
the
valley
finding
her
companion
none
too
willing
to
impart
additional
information
penny
reread
the
advertisement
the
item
had
appeared
in
the
hobostein
county
paper
only
the
previous
week
the
words
themselves
rather
than
the
offer
of
a
reward
enchanted
her
headless
horseman
witching
rock
she
thought
excitedly
why
even
the
names
scream
of
mystery
aloud
she
urged
malcom
do
tell
me
more
about
the
matter
who
is
mr
burmaster
there
was
no
answer
penny
glanced
up
from
the
advertisement
and
stared
in
astonishment
the
elderly
man
no
longer
stood
beside
her
not
a
soul
was
in
the
long
empty
hall
the
old
man
of
the
hills
had
vanished
as
quietly
as
if
spirited
away
by
an
unseen
hand
chapter
now
what
became
of
that
old
man
penny
asked
herself
in
perplexity
i
did
hear
him
steal
away
he
could
have
vanished
into
thin
air
or
did
he
thinking
that
malcom
might
have
gone
back
to
the
department
she
hastily
returned
there
to
her
anxious
inquiry
the
clerk
responded
with
a
grin
no
old
whiskers
has
been
here
if
you
find
him
ask
for
his
address
he
forgot
to
leave
it
decidedly
disturbed
penny
ran
down
the
hall
which
gave
exit
to
the
street
breathlessly
she
asked
the
elevator
attendant
if
he
had
seen
an
old
man
leave
the
building
a
fellow
with
a
long
white
beard
yes
and
a
cane
which
way
did
he
go
ca
tell
you
that
but
you
did
see
him
penny
demanded
impatiently
sure
he
went
out
the
door
a
minute
or
two
ago
he
was
talking
to
himself
like
he
was
a
bit
cracked
in
the
head
he
was
chuckling
as
if
he
knew
a
great
joke
and
i
it
penny
muttered
she
darted
through
the
revolving
doors
to
the
street
with
the
noon
hour
close
at
hand
throngs
of
persons
poured
from
the
various
offices
amid
the
bustling
hurrying
crowd
she
saw
no
one
who
remotely
resembled
the
old
man
of
the
hills
he
slipped
away
on
purpose
she
thought
he
gave
me
the
newspaper
clipping
just
to
stir
my
interest
and
then
left
without
explaining
a
thing
abandoning
the
search
as
hopeless
penny
again
reread
the
clipping
five
hundred
dollars
offered
for
information
leading
to
the
capture
of
a
headless
horseman
why
it
sounded
fantastic
but
the
advertisement
actually
had
appeared
in
a
country
newspaper
therefore
it
must
have
some
basis
of
fact
still
mulling
the
matter
over
in
her
mind
penny
climbed
a
long
flight
of
stairs
to
the
news
room
near
the
door
stood
an
empty
desk
for
many
years
that
desk
had
been
occupied
by
jerry
livingston
crack
reporter
now
absent
on
military
leave
it
gave
penny
a
tight
feeling
to
see
the
covered
typewriter
for
she
and
jerry
had
shared
many
grand
times
together
she
went
quickly
on
past
a
long
row
of
desks
where
other
reporters
tapped
out
their
stories
she
nodded
to
dewitt
the
city
editor
waved
at
salt
sommers
photographer
and
entered
her
father
private
office
hello
dad
she
greeted
him
cheerfully
busy
i
was
anthony
parker
put
aside
the
mouthpiece
of
a
dictaphone
machine
to
smile
fondly
at
his
one
and
only
child
he
was
a
tall
lean
man
and
a
recent
illness
had
left
him
even
thinner
than
before
penny
sank
into
an
upholstered
chair
in
front
of
her
father
desk
if
it
money
you
want
began
parker
the
answer
is
no
not
one
cent
until
your
allowance
is
due
and
no
sob
story
please
why
dad
penny
shot
him
an
injured
look
i
was
even
thinking
of
money
at
least
not
such
a
trivial
amount
as
exchanges
hands
on
my
allowance
day
nothing
less
than
five
hundred
dollars
interests
me
five
hundred
dollars
oh
i
aim
to
earn
it
myself
penny
assured
him
hastily
how
may
i
ask
maybe
by
catching
a
headless
horseman
penny
grinned
mischievously
it
seems
that
one
is
galloping
wild
out
red
valley
way
red
valley
never
heard
of
the
place
parker
began
to
show
irritation
penny
what
are
you
talking
about
anyway
this
explained
penny
spreading
the
clipping
on
the
desk
an
old
fellow
who
looked
like
rip
van
winkle
gave
it
to
me
then
he
disappeared
before
i
could
ask
any
questions
what
do
you
think
dad
parker
read
the
advertisement
at
a
glance
bunk
he
exploded
pure
bunk
but
dad
protested
penny
hotly
it
was
printed
in
the
hobostein
weekly
i
do
care
who
published
it
or
where
i
still
say
was
that
the
same
word
you
used
not
so
long
ago
when
i
tried
to
tell
you
about
a
certain
witch
doll
teased
penny
i
started
off
on
what
looked
like
a
foolish
chase
but
i
came
back
dragging
one
of
the
best
news
stories
the
ever
published
remember
no
chance
you
ever
let
me
forget
dad
i
have
a
hunch
penny
went
on
ignoring
the
jibe
there
a
big
story
in
this
headless
horseman
business
i
just
feel
it
i
suppose
you
like
to
have
me
assign
you
the
task
of
tracking
down
your
front
page
gem
now
you
talking
my
language
penny
ca
you
see
it
only
a
joke
parker
asked
in
exasperation
the
headless
horseman
of
sleepy
hollow
that
story
was
written
years
ago
by
a
man
named
washington
irving
or
did
you
know
oh
i
read
the
of
sleepy
hollow
penny
retorted
loftily
i
remember
one
of
the
characters
was
ichabod
crane
he
was
chased
by
the
headless
horseman
and
nearly
died
of
fright
a
nice
bit
of
fiction
commented
parker
he
tapped
the
newspaper
clipping
and
so
is
this
the
best
place
for
it
is
in
the
scrap
basket
oh
no
it
is
penny
leaped
forward
to
rescue
the
precious
clipping
carefully
she
folded
it
into
her
purse
dad
i
convinced
sleepy
hollow
must
be
a
real
place
why
ca
i
go
there
to
interview
mr
burmaster
did
you
say
burmaster
yes
the
person
who
offers
the
reward
he
signed
himself
j
burmaster
that
name
is
rather
familiar
parker
said
thoughtfully
wonder
if
it
could
be
john
burmaster
the
millionaire
probably
not
but
i
recall
that
a
man
by
that
name
built
an
estate
called
sleepy
hollow
somewhere
in
the
hill
country
there
cried
penny
triumphantly
you
see
the
story
does
have
substance
after
all
may
i
make
the
trip
how
would
you
find
burmaster
a
big
estate
should
be
hard
to
locate
i
can
trace
him
through
the
hobostein
weekly
what
do
you
say
dad
the
matter
is
for
weems
to
decide
now
scram
out
of
here
i
have
work
to
do
thanks
for
letting
me
go
laughed
penny
giving
him
a
big
hug
now
about
finances
but
we
discuss
that
angle
later
blowing
her
father
an
airy
kiss
she
pranced
out
of
the
office
penny
fairly
trod
on
clouds
as
she
raced
toward
the
home
of
her
chum
louise
sidell
her
chum
sat
listlessly
on
the
porch
reading
a
book
but
she
jumped
to
her
feet
as
she
saw
her
friend
from
the
way
penny
took
the
steps
at
one
leap
she
knew
there
was
important
news
to
divulge
what
up
she
demanded
alertly
hop
skip
and
count
three
laughed
penny
we
about
to
launch
forth
into
a
grand
and
glorious
adventure
how
would
you
like
to
go
in
search
of
a
headless
horseman
any
kind
of
a
creature
suits
me
chuckled
louise
when
do
we
start
and
where
lead
me
to
a
map
and
i
try
to
answer
your
questions
our
first
problem
is
to
find
a
place
called
red
valley
for
a
half
hour
the
two
girls
poured
over
a
state
map
hobostein
county
was
an
area
close
by
while
red
valley
proved
to
be
an
isolated
little
locality
less
than
a
day
journey
from
riverview
penny
was
further
encouraged
to
learn
that
the
valley
she
proposed
to
visit
had
been
settled
by
dutch
pioneers
and
that
many
of
the
original
families
still
had
descendants
living
there
it
will
be
an
interesting
trip
even
if
we
do
run
into
any
mystery
louise
said
philosophically
are
you
sure
you
can
go
penny
well
pretty
sure
dad
said
it
was
up
to
weems
to
decide
louise
gave
her
chum
a
sideways
glance
that
seems
like
a
mighty
big
to
me
oh
i
bring
her
around
somehow
pack
your
suitcase
lou
we
start
tomorrow
morning
bright
and
early
though
penny
spoke
with
confidence
she
was
less
certain
of
her
powers
as
she
entered
her
own
home
a
few
minutes
later
she
found
weems
the
stout
housekeeper
in
the
kitchen
making
cookies
now
please
do
gobble
any
of
that
raw
dough
weems
remonstrated
as
the
girl
reached
for
one
of
the
freshly
cut
circles
ca
you
wait
until
they
baked
penny
perched
herself
on
the
sink
counter
reminded
that
her
heels
were
making
marks
on
the
cabinet
door
she
drew
them
up
beneath
her
and
balanced
like
an
acrobat
forthwith
she
launched
into
a
glowing
tale
of
her
morning
activities
the
story
failed
to
bring
a
responsive
warmth
from
the
housekeeper
i
declare
i
ca
make
sense
out
of
what
you
saying
she
protested
headless
horsemen
my
word
i
afraid
you
the
one
who
lost
your
head
the
ideas
you
do
get
weems
sadly
heaved
a
deep
sigh
since
the
death
of
parker
many
years
before
she
had
assumed
complete
charge
of
the
household
however
the
task
of
raising
penny
had
been
almost
too
much
for
the
patient
woman
though
she
loved
the
girl
as
her
own
there
were
times
when
she
felt
that
running
a
circus
would
be
much
easier
louise
and
i
plan
to
start
for
red
valley
by
train
early
tomorrow
said
penny
briskly
we
probably
catch
the
if
i
can
get
up
in
time
and
has
your
father
said
you
may
go
he
said
it
was
up
to
you
weems
smiled
grimly
then
the
matter
is
settled
i
shall
put
my
foot
down
oh
weems
penny
wailed
please
do
ruin
all
our
plans
the
trip
means
so
much
to
me
i
heard
that
argument
before
replied
weems
unmoved
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
allow
you
to
start
off
on
such
a
wild
chase
but
i
expect
to
get
a
dandy
story
for
dad
paper
that
only
an
excuse
sighed
the
housekeeper
the
truth
is
that
you
crave
adventure
and
excitement
it
a
trait
which
unfortunately
you
inherited
from
your
father
penny
decided
to
play
her
trump
card
weems
red
valley
is
one
of
those
picturesque
hidden
localities
where
families
have
gone
on
for
generation
after
generation
the
place
must
fairly
swim
with
antiques
would
you
like
to
have
me
buy
a
few
for
you
while
i
there
despite
her
intentions
weems
displayed
interest
as
penny
very
well
knew
collecting
antiques
had
become
an
absorbing
hobby
with
her
silas
malcom
has
a
spinning
wheel
for
sale
penny
went
on
pressing
home
the
advantage
she
had
gained
i
find
him
if
i
can
and
buy
it
for
you
your
schemes
are
as
transparent
as
glass
but
you
will
let
me
go
i
probably
will
sighed
weems
i
learned
to
my
sorrow
that
in
any
event
you
usually
get
your
way
penny
danced
out
of
the
kitchen
to
a
telephone
it
all
set
she
gleefully
told
louise
we
leave
early
tomorrow
morning
for
red
valley
and
if
i
do
earn
that
five
hundred
dollar
reward
then
my
name
is
penny
gumshoe
parker
chapter
the
the
slow
train
crept
around
a
bend
and
puffed
to
a
standstill
at
the
drowsing
little
station
of
hobostein
louise
and
penny
their
linen
suits
mussed
from
many
weary
hours
of
sitting
were
the
only
passengers
to
alight
yesterday
it
seemed
like
a
good
idea
sighed
louise
but
now
i
not
so
sure
penny
stepped
aside
to
avoid
a
which
was
being
pushed
down
the
deserted
platform
by
a
station
attendant
she
too
felt
ill
at
ease
in
this
strange
town
and
the
task
she
had
set
for
herself
suddenly
seemed
a
silly
one
but
not
for
anything
in
the
world
would
she
make
such
an
admission
first
we
find
the
newspaper
office
she
said
briskly
this
town
is
so
small
it
ca
be
far
away
they
carried
their
bags
into
the
stuffy
little
station
the
agent
in
shirt
sleeves
and
green
eye
shade
speared
a
train
order
on
the
spindle
and
then
glanced
curiously
at
the
girls
anything
i
can
do
for
you
yes
replied
penny
please
tell
us
how
to
find
the
offices
of
the
hobostein
weekly
it
just
a
piece
down
the
street
directed
the
agent
go
past
the
old
town
pump
and
the
livery
stable
a
red
brick
building
best
one
in
town
you
ca
miss
it
penny
and
louise
took
their
bags
and
crossed
to
the
shady
side
of
the
street
a
horse
and
carriage
had
been
tied
to
a
hitching
post
and
by
contrast
an
expensive
new
automobile
was
parked
beside
it
the
unpaved
road
was
thick
with
dust
the
broken
sidewalk
was
coated
with
it
as
were
the
little
plots
of
struggling
grass
in
the
entire
town
few
persons
were
abroad
an
old
lady
in
a
sunbonnet
busily
loaded
boxes
of
groceries
into
a
farm
wagon
the
only
other
sign
of
activity
was
at
the
livery
stable
where
a
group
of
men
slouched
on
the
street
benches
must
we
pass
there
louise
murmured
those
men
are
staring
as
if
they
never
saw
a
girl
before
let
them
said
penny
undisturbed
two
doors
beyond
the
livery
stable
stood
a
newly
built
red
brick
building
in
gold
paint
on
the
expanse
of
unwashed
plate
glass
window
were
the
words
hobostein
weekly
with
heads
high
the
girls
ran
the
gantlet
of
loungers
and
reached
the
newspaper
office
through
the
plate
glass
they
glimpsed
a
large
cluttered
room
where
desks
bins
of
type
table
forms
and
a
massive
press
all
seemed
jammed
together
a
rotund
man
they
took
to
be
the
editor
was
talking
to
a
customer
in
a
loud
voice
neither
took
the
slightest
notice
of
the
girls
as
they
pushed
open
the
door
i
do
care
who
you
are
or
how
much
money
you
have
the
editor
was
saying
heatedly
i
run
my
paper
as
i
please
see
if
you
do
like
my
editorials
you
do
have
to
read
them
you
a
stubborn
dutchman
the
other
man
retorted
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
what
you
run
in
your
stupid
old
weekly
providing
you
do
deliberately
try
to
stir
up
the
people
of
this
valley
worrying
about
your
pocketbook
i
the
largest
tax
payer
in
the
valley
if
there
an
assessment
for
repairs
on
the
huntley
lake
dam
it
will
cost
me
thousands
of
dollars
and
if
you
had
an
ounce
of
sense
you
see
that
without
the
repairs
your
property
may
not
be
worth
a
nickel
if
these
rains
keep
up
the
dam
apt
to
give
way
and
your
property
would
go
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
not
that
i
worried
about
your
property
but
i
am
concerned
about
the
folks
who
are
still
living
in
the
valley
schultz
you
a
the
other
accused
there
no
danger
of
the
dam
giving
way
and
you
know
it
by
writing
these
hot
editorials
you
just
trying
to
stir
up
public
feeling
you
hoping
to
shake
me
down
so
i
underwrite
a
costly
and
unnecessary
repair
bill
the
editor
pushed
back
his
chair
and
arose
his
voice
remained
controlled
but
his
eyes
snapped
like
fire
brands
get
out
of
this
office
he
ordered
the
hobostein
weekly
can
do
without
your
subscription
you
been
a
pain
to
this
community
ever
since
you
came
good
afternoon
you
ca
talk
like
that
to
me
byron
schultz
the
other
man
began
hotly
then
his
gaze
fell
upon
louise
and
penny
who
stood
just
inside
the
door
jamming
on
his
hat
he
went
angrily
from
the
building
the
editor
crumpled
a
sheet
of
paper
and
hurled
it
into
a
waste
basket
the
act
seemed
to
restore
his
good
humor
for
with
a
wry
grin
he
then
turned
toward
the
girls
yes
he
inquired
penny
scarcely
knew
how
to
begin
sliding
into
a
chair
beside
the
editor
desk
she
fumbled
in
her
purse
for
the
advertisement
clipped
from
the
hobostein
weekly
to
her
confusion
she
could
not
find
it
lose
something
the
editor
inquired
kindly
that
my
trouble
too
last
week
we
misplaced
the
copy
for
gregg
grocery
store
and
was
jake
hoppin
mad
found
it
again
just
before
the
weekly
went
to
press
here
it
is
said
penny
triumphantly
she
placed
the
clipping
on
schultz
desk
have
i
had
enough
of
that
man
in
one
day
the
editor
snorted
the
old
skinflint
never
paid
me
for
the
ad
either
who
is
j
burmaster
penny
inquired
eagerly
who
is
he
the
editor
eyes
sent
out
little
flashes
of
fire
he
the
most
egotistical
property
owner
in
this
community
not
the
man
who
was
just
here
yes
that
was
john
burmaster
then
he
lives
in
hobostein
he
does
not
said
the
editor
with
emphasis
it
bad
enough
having
him
seven
miles
away
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
have
seen
sleepy
hollow
estate
penny
shook
her
head
she
explained
that
as
strangers
to
the
town
she
and
louise
had
made
no
trips
or
inquiries
sleepy
hollow
is
quite
a
show
place
the
editor
went
on
grudgingly
old
burmaster
built
it
about
a
year
ago
imported
an
architect
and
workmen
from
the
city
the
house
has
a
long
bridge
leading
up
to
it
and
is
supposed
to
be
like
the
sleepy
hollow
of
legend
only
the
legend
kinda
backfired
you
speaking
about
the
headless
horseman
penny
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
when
burmaster
built
his
house
the
old
skinflint
did
calculate
on
getting
a
haunt
to
go
with
it
the
editor
chuckled
served
him
right
for
being
so
muleish
but
what
is
the
story
of
the
headless
horseman
penny
asked
has
burmaster
actually
offered
a
five
hundred
dollar
reward
for
its
capture
he
give
double
the
amount
to
get
that
horseman
off
his
neck
chuckled
the
editor
but
folks
up
delta
way
are
so
dumb
the
reward
never
will
be
collected
is
delta
the
name
of
a
town
yes
it
up
the
valley
a
piece
explained
schultz
you
do
seem
very
familiar
with
our
layout
here
no
my
friend
and
i
come
from
riverview
well
you
see
it
like
this
the
editor
drew
a
crude
map
for
the
girls
sleepy
hollow
estate
is
situated
in
a
sort
of
shaped
valley
just
below
it
is
the
little
town
of
delta
and
on
below
that
a
hamlet
called
raven
we
at
the
foot
of
the
valley
so
to
speak
huntley
lake
and
the
dam
are
just
above
sleepy
hollow
estate
and
is
there
really
danger
that
the
dam
will
give
way
if
you
want
my
opinion
read
the
hobostein
weekly
answered
the
editor
the
dam
wo
wash
out
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
but
if
these
rains
keep
on
the
whole
valley
in
danger
but
try
to
pound
any
sense
into
burmaster
thick
head
you
started
to
tell
me
about
the
headless
horseman
penny
reminded
him
did
i
now
smiled
the
editor
do
recollect
it
myself
fact
is
burmaster
ghost
troubles
do
interest
me
one
whit
but
we
come
all
the
way
from
riverview
just
to
find
out
about
the
headless
horseman
calculate
on
earning
that
reward
the
editor
eyes
twinkled
perhaps
then
you
do
want
to
waste
time
trying
to
get
information
burmaster
the
man
for
you
to
see
talk
to
him
well
no
you
talk
to
burmaster
the
editor
said
with
finality
only
tell
him
i
sent
you
but
how
will
we
find
the
man
penny
was
rather
dismayed
to
have
the
interview
end
before
it
was
well
launched
oh
his
car
is
parked
down
the
street
the
editor
answered
carelessly
everyone
in
town
knows
burmaster
i
talk
to
you
longer
only
i
so
busy
this
afternoon
burmaster
is
the
one
to
tell
you
his
own
troubles
thus
dismissed
the
girls
could
do
nothing
but
thank
the
editor
and
leave
the
newspaper
building
dubiously
they
looked
up
and
down
the
street
the
fine
new
car
they
had
noticed
a
little
while
earlier
no
longer
was
parked
at
the
curb
nor
was
there
any
sign
of
the
man
who
had
just
left
the
newspaper
office
all
we
can
do
is
inquire
for
him
said
penny
at
a
grocery
store
farther
down
the
street
they
paused
to
ask
if
burmaster
had
been
seen
the
store
keeper
finished
grinding
a
pound
of
coffee
for
a
customer
and
then
answered
penny
question
mr
burmaster
he
repeated
why
yes
he
was
in
town
but
he
pulled
out
about
five
minutes
ago
then
we
just
missed
him
penny
exclaimed
burmaster
on
his
way
to
sleepy
hollow
by
this
time
the
store
keeper
agreed
you
might
catch
him
there
but
how
can
we
get
to
sleepy
hollow
well
there
a
train
only
runs
once
a
day
though
and
it
went
through
about
half
an
hour
ago
that
was
the
train
we
came
in
on
is
there
a
car
one
can
hire
do
know
of
any
clem
williams
has
some
good
horses
though
he
keeps
the
livery
stable
down
the
street
their
faces
very
long
the
girls
picked
up
their
overnight
bags
and
went
outside
again
i
knew
this
trip
would
be
a
said
louise
disconsolately
here
we
are
stuck
high
and
dry
until
our
train
comes
in
tomorrow
but
why
give
up
so
easily
we
licked
that
why
we
missed
burmaster
and
we
ca
go
to
sleepy
hollow
after
him
penny
gazed
thoughtfully
down
the
street
at
clem
williams
livery
stable
why
ca
we
go
to
sleepy
hollow
she
demanded
let
rent
horses
louise
waxed
sarcastic
to
be
sure
we
can
canter
along
balancing
these
overnight
bags
on
the
pommel
of
our
saddles
we
have
to
leave
our
luggage
behind
penny
planned
briskly
the
most
essential
things
we
can
wrap
up
in
knapsacks
but
i
not
a
good
rider
louise
complained
the
last
time
we
rode
a
mile
i
could
walk
for
a
week
seven
miles
is
so
far
seven
miles
louise
gasped
why
it
slaughter
oh
you
last
chuckled
penny
confidently
i
see
to
that
i
am
curious
to
see
sleepy
hollow
estate
louise
admitted
with
reluctance
all
that
talk
about
the
huntley
dam
interested
me
too
and
the
headless
horseman
that
part
rather
worries
me
penny
do
you
realize
that
if
we
go
to
sleepy
hollow
we
may
run
into
more
than
we
bargain
for
penny
laughed
and
grasping
her
chums
arm
pulled
her
down
the
street
that
what
i
hope
she
confessed
unless
sleepy
hollow
lets
us
down
shamefully
our
adventure
is
just
starting
chapter
stranger
of
the
even
for
late
september
it
was
a
warm
day
the
horses
plodded
slowly
up
a
steep
winding
trail
heavily
canopied
with
yellowing
maple
leaves
louise
and
penny
swished
angrily
at
the
buzzing
mosquitoes
and
tried
to
urge
their
tired
mounts
to
a
faster
pace
i
warned
you
this
trip
would
be
slaughter
louise
complained
ducking
to
avoid
a
tree
limb
furthermore
i
suspect
we
lost
how
could
we
be
when
we
have
turned
off
the
trail
penny
called
over
her
shoulder
she
rode
ahead
on
a
sorry
looking
nag
appropriately
named
bones
the
animal
was
more
easily
managed
than
the
skittish
mare
louise
had
chosen
at
williams
livery
stable
but
had
an
annoying
appetite
for
foliage
williams
directions
were
clear
enough
penny
resumed
he
said
to
follow
this
trail
until
we
reach
a
little
town
named
delta
providing
we
survive
that
long
louise
interposed
crossly
how
far
from
delta
to
sleepy
hollow
not
more
than
two
or
three
miles
and
once
we
get
down
out
of
these
hills
into
the
valley
the
going
should
be
much
easier
penny
spoke
with
forced
cheerfulness
in
truth
she
too
had
wearied
of
the
trip
which
in
the
last
hour
had
become
sheer
torture
instead
of
adventure
her
freckled
face
was
blotched
with
mosquito
bites
every
hairpin
had
been
jolted
from
her
head
and
muscles
fairly
screamed
a
protest
louise
on
an
unruly
horse
had
taken
even
more
punishment
penny
gave
bones
a
dig
in
the
ribs
the
horse
quickened
his
step
weaving
a
corkscrew
path
around
the
trunks
of
the
giant
trees
gradually
the
tangle
of
brush
and
trees
began
to
thin
out
they
came
at
last
to
a
clearing
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
penny
drew
rein
beside
a
huge
rock
below
stretched
a
beautiful
rich
green
valley
through
which
wound
a
river
from
the
of
a
cluster
of
houses
smoke
curled
lazily
blending
into
the
blue
rim
of
the
distant
hills
did
you
ever
see
a
prettier
little
valley
penny
asked
her
interest
reviving
that
must
be
delta
down
there
louise
was
too
weary
to
look
or
answer
she
slid
out
of
the
saddle
and
tossed
the
reins
over
a
tree
limb
near
by
a
spring
gushed
from
between
the
rocks
she
walked
stiffly
to
it
and
drank
deeply
of
the
cool
water
lou
the
valley
looks
exactly
as
i
hoped
it
would
penny
went
on
eagerly
it
has
a
dreamy
drowsy
atmosphere
just
as
irving
described
the
sleepy
hollow
of
legend
louise
bent
to
drink
of
the
spring
again
she
sponged
her
hot
face
with
a
dampened
handkerchief
pulling
off
shoes
and
stockings
she
let
the
cool
water
trickle
over
her
bare
feet
according
to
legend
the
valley
and
its
inhabitants
were
bewitched
penny
rambled
on
why
the
indians
considered
these
hills
as
the
abode
of
spirits
sometimes
the
spirits
took
mischievous
delight
in
wreaking
trouble
upon
the
villagers
penny
voice
trailed
off
from
far
down
the
hillside
came
the
faint
thud
of
hoofbeats
the
girl
attention
became
fixed
upon
a
moving
horseman
on
the
road
below
now
what
inquired
louise
impatiently
do
try
to
tell
me
seen
the
headless
horseman
already
i
certainly
seen
a
horseman
my
can
that
fellow
ride
louise
picked
up
her
shoes
and
hobbled
over
the
stones
to
the
end
through
a
gap
in
the
trees
she
gazed
down
upon
a
winding
turnpike
fringed
on
either
side
with
an
rail
fence
a
horseman
mounted
on
a
roan
mare
rode
bareback
at
a
full
run
as
the
girls
watched
in
admiration
the
mare
took
the
low
fence
in
one
magnificent
leap
and
crashed
out
of
sight
through
the
trees
you
right
penny
louise
acknowledged
what
would
i
give
to
be
able
to
ride
like
that
one
of
the
villagers
i
suppose
the
hoofbeats
rapidly
died
away
louise
turned
wearily
around
intending
to
remount
her
horse
she
stared
in
astonishment
where
the
mare
had
grazed
there
now
was
only
trampled
grass
where
my
horse
she
demanded
where
white
foot
spirited
away
by
the
witches
maybe
this
is
no
time
for
any
of
your
feeble
jokes
penny
parker
that
stupid
horse
must
have
wandered
off
while
i
was
admiring
your
old
valley
and
that
rider
penny
remained
undisturbed
oh
we
find
the
mare
all
right
she
said
confidently
she
ca
be
far
away
the
girls
thought
that
they
heard
a
crashing
of
underbrush
to
the
left
of
the
trail
investigation
did
not
disclose
that
the
horse
had
gone
that
way
they
could
hear
no
hoofbeats
nor
was
any
of
the
grass
trampled
i
bet
white
foot
on
her
way
back
to
williams
stable
by
this
time
louise
declared
crossly
such
luck
she
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
put
on
her
shoes
and
stockings
we
did
hear
the
horse
run
off
lou
she
ca
be
far
then
you
find
her
i
had
all
i
can
stand
i
tired
and
i
hungry
and
i
wish
i
never
come
on
this
wild
silly
chase
tears
began
to
trickle
down
louise
face
penny
slid
down
from
bones
and
patted
her
chum
arm
awkwardly
louise
pulled
away
from
her
now
do
give
me
any
pep
talk
or
i
simply
bawl
she
warned
what
am
i
going
to
do
without
a
horse
why
that
easy
lou
we
ride
double
back
to
williams
stable
well
not
tonight
it
getting
late
and
after
coming
this
far
it
would
be
foolish
to
turn
around
and
start
right
back
it
would
be
the
most
sensible
act
of
our
lives
louise
retorted
but
then
i
might
know
you
insist
on
pushing
on
you
and
christopher
columbus
have
a
lot
in
common
we
came
to
find
out
about
that
headless
horseman
did
we
you
did
i
guess
louise
sighed
getting
up
from
the
rock
i
just
came
along
because
i
weak
minded
well
what
the
plan
let
ride
down
to
delta
and
try
to
get
a
room
for
the
night
louise
silence
gave
consent
she
climbed
up
behind
penny
on
bones
and
they
jogged
down
the
trail
toward
the
turnpike
it
queer
how
white
foot
sneaked
away
without
making
a
sound
penny
presently
commented
according
to
the
old
legend
strange
things
did
happen
in
the
sleepy
hollow
valley
the
spirit
was
supposed
to
wreak
all
sorts
of
vexations
upon
the
inhabitants
sometimes
he
would
take
the
shape
of
a
bear
or
a
deer
and
lead
bewildered
hunters
a
merry
chase
through
the
woods
you
the
one
who
is
bewitched
louise
broke
in
and
if
you
ask
me
you
been
that
way
ever
since
you
were
born
there
a
little
spark
something
deep
within
you
that
keeps
saying
on
penny
sic
penny
maybe
you
find
a
mystery
perhaps
i
shall
too
oh
i
do
doubt
that
you
turned
up
some
dandy
news
stories
for
your
father
paper
but
this
is
different
how
so
in
the
first
place
we
both
know
there
no
such
thing
as
a
headless
horseman
it
must
all
be
a
joke
would
you
call
that
advertisement
in
the
hobostein
paper
a
joke
it
could
have
been
we
do
know
many
of
the
facts
that
why
we
here
penny
guided
bones
onto
the
wide
turnpike
before
she
could
add
more
louise
grasp
about
her
waist
suddenly
tightened
listen
penny
someone
coming
penny
drew
rein
distinctly
both
girls
could
hear
the
of
approaching
hoofbeats
their
hope
that
it
might
be
white
foot
was
quickly
dashed
a
moment
later
the
same
horseman
they
had
observed
a
few
minutes
earlier
swung
around
the
bend
the
young
man
rapidly
overtook
the
girls
from
the
way
he
grinned
they
suspected
that
they
presented
a
ridiculous
sight
as
they
rocked
along
on
bones
swaying
back
he
sat
his
own
horse
a
handsome
roan
with
easy
grace
louise
tugged
at
her
skirt
which
kept
creeping
above
her
knees
laughing
at
us
she
muttered
under
her
breath
the
rider
cantered
up
then
deliberately
slowed
his
horse
to
a
walk
louise
stole
a
quick
sideways
glance
the
young
man
was
about
and
very
good
looking
his
flashing
brown
eyes
were
friendly
and
so
was
his
voice
as
he
spoke
a
cheery
girls
hello
penny
responded
briefly
louise
immediately
nudged
her
in
the
ribs
a
silent
warning
that
she
considered
the
stranger
fresh
nevertheless
penny
twisted
sideways
in
the
saddle
the
better
to
look
at
their
road
companion
he
wore
whipcord
riding
breeches
and
highly
polished
boots
from
the
cut
of
his
clothes
she
decided
that
he
too
was
a
comparative
stranger
to
the
hill
country
not
looking
for
a
horse
by
any
chance
are
you
the
young
man
inquired
louise
snub
nose
came
down
out
of
the
sky
oh
we
are
she
cried
where
did
you
see
her
a
mare
with
a
white
foot
her
left
hind
one
yes
that
white
foot
louise
exclaimed
joyfully
the
stupid
creature
wandered
off
saw
her
making
for
the
valley
about
five
minutes
ago
like
enough
she
turned
in
at
silas
malcom
place
the
name
took
penny
by
surprise
although
she
had
hoped
to
find
the
old
man
who
had
visited
the
office
she
had
not
thought
it
possible
without
a
long
search
does
malcom
live
near
here
she
inquired
yes
his
farm
on
down
the
pike
want
me
to
ride
along
and
show
you
the
way
under
the
circumstance
penny
and
louise
had
no
choice
but
to
accept
the
offer
however
they
both
thought
that
the
young
man
merely
was
making
an
excuse
to
accompany
them
he
seemed
to
read
their
minds
for
he
said
i
did
actually
see
your
missing
horse
turn
in
at
the
malcom
place
know
why
i
think
she
be
there
perhaps
you
have
supernatural
powers
penny
said
lightly
from
what
we
hear
this
valley
is
quite
a
place
for
witches
and
headless
horsemen
the
young
man
gave
her
an
amused
glance
the
explanation
is
quite
simple
he
laughed
silas
used
to
own
that
horse
all
horses
have
a
strong
homing
instinct
you
know
i
noticed
that
louise
contributed
a
bit
grimly
guess
i
should
introduce
myself
the
young
man
resumed
name
joe
quigley
i
the
station
agent
at
delta
we
glad
to
meet
you
penny
responded
though
louise
scowled
at
her
she
gave
their
own
names
she
added
that
they
had
come
to
the
valley
seeking
information
about
the
mysterious
headless
horseman
friends
of
mr
burmaster
quigley
inquired
casually
oh
no
penny
assured
him
we
just
came
for
the
fun
of
it
is
it
true
that
some
prankster
has
been
causing
trouble
in
the
valley
prankster
yes
someone
fixed
up
to
resemble
the
headless
horseman
of
fable
quigley
grinned
broadly
well
now
you
could
prove
it
by
me
some
folks
say
that
on
certain
foggy
nights
the
old
galloping
hessian
does
ride
down
out
of
the
hills
but
then
there
are
folks
who
claim
their
butter
wo
churn
because
it
been
bewitched
i
never
put
much
stock
in
such
talk
myself
then
you
never
actually
seen
such
a
rider
joe
quigley
remained
silent
after
a
thoughtful
interval
he
admitted
well
one
night
over
a
month
ago
i
did
see
something
strange
what
was
it
louise
asked
quickly
quigley
pointed
far
up
the
hillside
see
that
big
boulder
witching
rock
it
called
penny
nodded
we
were
there
only
a
few
minutes
ago
at
night
fog
rises
up
from
the
valley
and
gives
the
place
a
spooky
look
years
ago
a
tramp
was
killed
there
no
one
ever
did
learn
the
how
or
why
of
it
what
was
it
you
saw
penny
inquired
ca
rightly
say
quigley
returned
soberly
i
was
on
this
same
turnpike
when
i
chanced
to
glance
up
toward
that
big
rock
i
saw
something
there
in
the
mist
and
then
the
next
minute
it
was
gone
not
the
headless
horseman
penny
asked
maybe
it
was
maybe
it
was
i
have
thought
i
imagined
it
only
i
heard
clattering
hoofbeats
but
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
about
this
valley
what
that
asked
louise
all
the
inhabitants
are
said
to
be
bewitched
that
why
i
act
so
crazy
myself
penny
tossed
her
head
oh
you
just
laughing
at
us
she
accused
i
suppose
it
does
sound
silly
to
say
we
came
here
searching
for
a
headless
horseman
no
it
not
in
the
least
silly
quigley
corrected
i
might
pay
you
a
compliment
by
saying
you
impress
me
as
very
courageous
young
ladies
may
i
offer
a
word
of
advice
thank
you
i
do
think
we
care
for
it
nevertheless
i
aim
to
give
it
anyway
quigley
grinned
down
at
penny
you
see
i
know
who
you
are
you
anthony
parker
daughter
and
you
built
up
a
reputation
for
solving
mysteries
penny
was
astonished
for
she
had
not
mentioned
her
father
name
never
mind
how
i
knew
said
quigley
forestalling
questions
here
my
tip
no
one
ever
will
collect
burmaster
reward
offer
so
do
waste
time
and
energy
trailing
a
phantom
why
do
you
say
the
reward
never
will
be
collected
quigley
would
not
answer
with
a
provoking
shake
of
his
head
he
pointed
down
the
pike
to
an
unpainted
cabin
and
a
huge
new
barn
that
the
malcom
place
he
said
if
i
not
mistaken
your
missing
horse
is
grazing
by
the
gate
goodbye
and
good
luck
with
a
friendly
salute
he
wheeled
his
mount
the
next
instant
horse
and
rider
had
crashed
through
a
gap
in
the
roadside
brush
and
were
lost
to
view
chapter
hollow
i
afraid
that
young
man
was
having
fun
at
our
expense
penny
remarked
after
horse
and
rider
had
gone
how
do
you
suppose
he
knew
about
my
father
read
it
in
a
newspaper
probably
you
both
made
the
headlines
often
enough
louise
sighed
wearily
and
shifted
positions
i
certainly
wish
we
never
had
come
here
well
i
do
penny
said
with
emphasis
she
clucked
to
bones
and
when
he
failed
to
move
smartly
along
gave
him
a
quick
jab
with
her
heels
if
joe
quigley
wo
tell
us
about
that
galloping
ghost
perhaps
malcom
will
i
settle
for
my
missing
horse
louise
responded
the
girls
jogged
on
down
the
road
toward
the
malcom
cabin
already
the
hills
were
casting
long
blue
shadows
over
the
valley
floor
with
night
fast
approaching
penny
began
to
wonder
where
they
could
seek
lodging
you
do
catch
me
staying
at
the
malcom
place
louise
said
reading
her
chum
thought
it
too
ramshackle
drawing
nearer
the
cabin
both
girls
were
elated
to
see
white
foot
grazing
contentedly
in
a
stony
field
adjoining
the
malcom
barn
yard
at
the
gate
penny
alighted
nimbly
and
threw
it
open
so
that
louise
could
ride
through
the
creaking
of
the
rusty
hinges
brought
silas
malcom
from
the
house
he
stared
blankly
for
a
moment
and
then
recognized
penny
well
bless
my
heart
he
said
if
it
ai
the
young
lady
that
helped
me
at
the
newspaper
office
and
now
it
your
turn
to
help
us
laughed
penny
we
lost
our
horse
i
knowed
somebody
would
be
along
for
her
purty
soon
the
old
man
chuckled
she
run
into
the
barn
yard
ten
minutes
ago
an
i
turned
her
out
to
graze
i
git
her
for
you
if
malcom
was
surprised
to
see
penny
so
far
from
riverview
he
did
not
disclose
it
he
asked
no
questions
hobbling
to
the
fence
he
whistled
a
shrill
blast
white
foot
pricked
up
her
ears
and
then
came
trotting
over
to
nuzzle
the
old
man
hand
you
certainly
have
that
horse
under
control
said
penny
admiringly
i
guess
it
all
in
the
way
you
handle
it
also
all
in
the
way
you
handle
a
flying
fortress
or
a
stick
of
dynamite
louise
cut
in
you
may
have
my
share
of
horses
white
foot
did
throw
you
off
malcom
inquired
oh
no
louise
assured
him
and
explained
how
the
horse
had
run
away
old
silas
chuckled
appreciatively
white
foot
always
did
have
a
habit
sneakin
off
like
that
raised
her
from
a
colt
but
sold
her
to
williams
down
in
hobostein
when
i
got
short
o
cash
wrapping
the
reins
about
a
hitching
post
the
old
man
allowed
his
gaze
to
wander
toward
the
valley
with
a
gesture
that
was
hard
to
interpret
he
indicated
the
long
stretch
of
fertile
pasture
land
golden
grain
fields
and
orderly
rows
of
young
orchard
trees
see
that
he
commanded
it
a
beautiful
valley
louise
murmured
politely
it
mor
that
corrected
the
old
man
you
lookin
at
one
o
the
richest
parcels
o
land
in
this
here
state
me
and
the
old
woman
lived
down
there
fer
goin
on
twenty
years
then
we
was
put
out
o
our
cabin
now
that
burmaster
owns
every
acre
fer
as
you
can
see
not
countin
the
village
o
delta
an
three
acres
held
fer
spite
by
the
widder
lear
old
silas
took
a
chew
of
tobacco
and
pointed
to
a
trim
little
log
cabin
visible
through
a
gap
in
the
trees
stands
out
like
a
sore
thumb
do
it
burmaster
done
everything
he
can
to
git
rid
o
that
place
but
the
widder
lear
jes
sits
tight
wo
have
no
dealings
with
him
says
that
if
the
old
skinflint
comes
round
her
place
again
she
goin
to
drive
him
off
with
a
shotgun
penny
and
louise
waited
hoping
that
the
old
man
would
tell
more
after
a
little
silence
he
resumed
meditatively
the
widder
was
the
smartest
o
the
lot
of
us
from
the
first
she
said
burmaster
was
out
to
gobble
up
all
the
best
land
for
hisself
nobody
could
get
her
to
sign
no
papers
that
why
she
got
her
little
place
today
and
the
rest
of
us
is
tryin
to
make
a
livin
out
o
these
stone
patches
burmaster
forced
all
of
the
valley
folk
off
their
land
penny
inquired
perplexed
how
could
he
do
that
some
of
sold
out
to
him
old
silas
admitted
but
mostly
the
land
was
owned
by
a
rich
feller
in
boston
he
never
paid
no
attention
to
his
holdings
to
collect
a
bit
o
rent
now
and
then
but
last
spring
he
up
and
sold
out
to
burmaster
and
we
was
all
told
to
git
off
the
land
penny
nodded
thoughtfully
i
suppose
that
was
entirely
legal
if
burmaster
bought
and
paid
for
the
land
one
could
accuse
him
of
dishonest
dealings
i
ai
accusin
nobody
o
nothin
old
silas
replied
i
tellin
you
how
things
are
in
this
here
valley
ye
came
to
find
out
about
that
headless
horseman
did
ye
well
yes
we
did
penny
acknowledged
figured
you
would
you
never
win
that
reward
burmaster
offerin
but
you
could
do
a
heap
o
good
in
this
here
valley
how
asked
penny
even
more
puzzled
you
got
a
pa
that
runs
a
big
city
newspaper
when
he
prints
an
editorial
piece
in
that
paper
o
his
folks
read
it
and
pay
attention
i
afraid
i
do
understand
you
will
after
you
been
here
awhile
the
old
man
chuckled
where
you
gals
calculatin
to
spend
the
night
i
wish
we
knew
me
and
the
ole
woman
be
glad
to
take
you
in
only
we
ai
got
no
room
fitten
for
gals
the
widder
lear
be
glad
to
give
you
bed
and
fodder
the
girls
thanked
malcom
though
secretly
they
were
sure
they
would
keep
on
until
they
reached
delta
a
suspicion
was
growing
in
penny
mind
that
she
had
not
come
to
the
valley
of
her
own
free
will
rather
she
had
been
lured
there
by
old
silas
headless
horseman
tale
she
had
assumed
the
old
fellow
to
be
a
simple
trusting
hillman
while
in
truth
he
meant
to
make
use
of
her
calculate
you
to
git
down
to
the
valley
night
sets
on
the
old
man
resumed
the
turnpike
no
fitten
place
for
a
gal
after
dark
you
think
we
might
meet
the
headless
horseman
penny
asked
smiling
old
silas
deliberately
allowed
the
question
to
pass
jes
follow
the
turnpike
he
instructed
you
come
fust
to
the
burmaster
place
then
on
beyond
is
the
widder
lear
cabin
she
treat
you
right
penny
had
intended
to
ask
old
silas
if
he
still
had
a
spinning
wheel
for
sale
however
a
glimpse
of
the
darkening
sky
warned
her
there
was
no
time
to
waste
she
and
louise
must
hasten
on
unless
they
expected
to
be
overtaken
by
night
goodbye
penny
said
vaulting
into
the
saddle
we
probably
see
you
again
before
we
leave
the
valley
calculate
you
will
agreed
old
silas
as
he
opened
the
gate
for
the
girls
he
smiled
in
a
way
they
could
not
fathom
once
more
on
the
curving
turnpike
penny
and
louise
discussed
the
old
man
strange
words
both
were
agreed
that
silas
had
not
been
in
the
least
surprised
to
see
them
but
why
did
he
say
i
could
do
good
in
the
valley
penny
speculated
evidently
he
thinks
i
influence
my
father
to
write
something
in
the
against
burmaster
perhaps
nodded
louise
everyone
we
met
seems
to
dislike
that
man
the
girls
clattered
over
a
little
log
bridge
and
rounded
a
bend
giant
trees
arched
their
limbs
over
the
pike
creating
a
dark
cool
tunnel
penny
and
louise
urged
their
tired
horses
to
a
faster
pace
though
neither
would
have
admitted
it
they
had
no
desire
to
be
on
the
turnpike
after
nightfall
listen
louise
commanded
suddenly
what
was
that
sound
penny
drew
rein
to
listen
only
a
chirp
of
a
cricket
disturbed
the
eerie
stillness
just
for
a
minute
i
thought
i
heard
hoofbeats
louise
said
apologetically
guess
i
must
have
imagined
it
emerging
from
the
long
avenue
of
trees
the
girls
were
slightly
dismayed
to
see
how
swiftly
darkness
had
spread
its
cloak
on
the
valley
beyond
the
next
turn
of
the
corkscrew
road
stood
a
giant
tulip
tree
riding
beneath
it
penny
stared
up
at
the
gnarled
limbs
which
were
twisted
in
fantastic
shapes
there
was
an
old
tulip
tree
in
the
legend
of
sleepy
hollow
she
murmured
in
awe
and
it
was
close
by
that
the
headless
horseman
appeared
will
you
please
hush
louise
interrupted
i
jittery
enough
without
any
from
you
some
distance
ahead
stretched
a
long
narrow
bridge
with
a
high
wooden
railing
by
straining
their
eyes
the
girls
could
see
that
it
crossed
a
mill
pond
and
led
in
a
graceful
curve
to
a
rambling
manor
house
of
clapboard
and
stone
burmaster
estate
louise
exclaimed
and
it
looks
exactly
as
i
imagined
it
would
penny
added
in
delight
a
perfect
setting
for
the
galloping
hessian
too
spooky
if
you
ask
me
said
louise
with
a
shiver
why
would
anyone
build
an
expensive
home
in
such
a
lonely
place
the
girls
rode
on
a
group
of
oaks
heavily
matted
with
wild
grapevines
threw
a
deeper
gloom
over
the
road
for
a
short
distance
the
dense
growth
of
trees
hid
the
estate
from
view
suddenly
the
girls
were
startled
to
hear
the
sharp
ringing
of
hoofs
unmistakably
the
sound
came
from
the
direction
of
the
long
narrow
bridge
there
i
knew
i
heard
hoofbeats
a
moment
ago
louise
whispered
nervously
maybe
it
the
headless
horseman
be
your
age
chided
penny
we
both
know
there
no
such
thing
the
words
died
on
her
lips
from
somewhere
in
the
darkness
ahead
came
a
woman
terrified
scream
frightened
by
the
sound
bones
gave
a
startled
snort
with
a
jerk
which
nearly
flung
penny
from
the
saddle
he
plunged
on
toward
the
bridge
chapter
and
his
ears
laid
back
bones
plunged
headlong
toward
the
bridge
pins
shook
from
penny
head
and
her
hair
became
a
stream
of
gold
in
the
wind
she
hunched
low
in
the
saddle
but
could
not
stop
the
horse
though
she
pulled
hard
on
the
reins
as
she
reached
a
dense
growth
of
elder
bushes
a
man
leaped
out
to
grasp
the
bridle
bones
snorted
angrily
and
pounded
the
earth
with
his
hoofs
oh
thank
you
penny
gasped
and
then
she
realized
that
the
man
had
not
meant
to
help
her
so
you
the
one
who
been
causing
so
much
trouble
here
he
exclaimed
wrathfully
get
down
out
of
that
saddle
i
do
no
such
thing
penny
retorted
she
tried
to
push
him
away
louise
came
trotting
up
on
white
foot
her
unexpected
arrival
seemed
to
disconcert
the
man
for
he
released
bones
bridle
what
he
trying
to
do
louise
demanded
sharply
pulling
up
beside
her
chum
before
penny
could
find
tongue
another
man
heavily
built
came
running
across
the
narrow
bridge
his
bald
head
bore
no
covering
and
the
long
tails
of
his
coat
flapped
wildly
in
the
wind
you
let
that
rider
get
away
jennings
he
cried
accusingly
to
the
workman
did
you
see
him
ride
across
the
bridge
and
then
take
a
trail
along
the
creek
bed
no
i
did
burmaster
the
workman
mumbled
i
heard
hoof
beats
and
came
as
fast
as
i
could
from
the
grist
mill
the
only
rider
i
saw
was
this
girl
there
two
of
we
have
a
perfect
right
to
be
here
penny
declared
we
were
riding
along
the
pike
when
we
heard
hoofbeats
then
a
scream
my
horse
became
frightened
and
plunged
down
this
way
toward
the
bridge
i
sorry
i
grabbed
the
bridle
miss
the
workman
apologized
you
see
i
thought
your
trouble
jennings
is
that
you
never
think
cut
in
the
owner
of
sleepy
hollow
curtly
you
never
even
saw
the
rider
who
got
away
no
sir
but
i
get
the
other
workmen
and
go
after
him
do
waste
your
efforts
he
was
only
a
boy
not
the
man
we
after
only
a
boy
sir
the
scamp
clattered
a
stick
against
the
railing
of
the
bridge
just
to
frighten
my
wife
burmaster
is
a
very
nervous
woman
yes
sir
replied
the
workman
rather
emphatically
i
know
sir
oh
you
do
burmaster
asked
his
tone
unfriendly
well
get
to
the
house
and
tell
her
there
no
cause
to
scream
to
high
heaven
the
boy
whoever
he
was
is
gone
i
tell
her
the
workman
mumbled
starting
away
and
mind
next
time
i
order
you
to
watch
this
road
i
mean
watch
it
the
estate
owner
called
after
him
if
you
do
i
find
another
man
to
take
your
place
as
burmaster
turned
toward
the
girls
they
obtained
a
better
view
of
his
face
he
wore
glasses
and
his
cheeks
were
pouchy
a
hooked
nose
curved
down
toward
a
mouth
that
was
hard
and
firm
yet
when
he
spoke
it
was
with
a
surprisingly
pleasant
tone
of
voice
i
must
apologize
for
the
stupid
actions
of
my
workman
he
said
to
penny
he
should
have
known
that
you
were
not
the
one
we
are
after
not
the
headless
horseman
penny
asked
half
jokingly
burmaster
stepped
closer
so
that
he
could
gaze
up
into
the
face
he
scrutinized
it
for
a
moment
and
then
without
answering
her
question
said
you
are
a
stranger
to
the
valley
yes
we
are
then
may
i
ask
how
you
knew
about
our
difficulties
here
at
sleepy
hollow
penny
explained
that
she
had
seen
the
estate
owner
advertisement
in
the
she
did
not
add
that
it
was
the
real
reason
why
she
and
louise
had
made
the
long
trip
from
riverview
i
be
willing
to
pay
any
amount
to
be
rid
of
that
ghost
who
annoys
us
here
at
sleepy
hollow
burmaster
said
bitterly
night
after
night
my
wife
has
had
no
rest
the
slightest
sound
terrifies
her
tell
us
more
about
the
mysterious
rider
penny
urged
what
time
does
he
appear
oh
there
no
predicting
that
often
he
rides
over
the
bridge
on
stormy
or
foggy
nights
then
again
it
apt
to
be
just
after
dusk
tonight
we
thought
we
had
the
scamp
but
it
proved
to
be
only
a
mischievous
boy
your
workmen
stand
guard
they
have
orders
to
watch
this
bridge
day
and
night
but
the
men
are
a
lazy
lot
they
wander
off
or
they
go
to
sleep
is
it
possible
that
the
disturbance
always
has
been
caused
by
a
boy
perhaps
this
lad
who
clattered
over
the
bridge
tonight
impossible
burmaster
snapped
impatiently
i
seen
the
headless
horseman
at
least
five
times
myself
you
mean
the
rider
actually
has
no
head
louise
interposed
in
awe
the
appearance
is
that
of
course
there
no
question
but
someone
from
the
village
or
the
hills
has
been
impersonating
irving
celebrated
character
of
fiction
the
point
is
the
joke
gone
too
far
i
should
think
so
louise
murmured
sympathetically
my
wife
and
i
came
to
this
little
valley
with
only
one
thought
we
wanted
to
build
a
fine
home
for
ourselves
amid
peaceful
surroundings
we
brought
in
city
workmen
a
clever
architect
no
expense
was
spared
to
make
this
house
and
estate
perfect
but
when
we
tried
to
recreate
the
atmosphere
of
sleepy
hollow
we
did
anticipate
getting
a
ghost
with
it
when
did
the
trouble
first
start
penny
asked
almost
from
the
hour
of
our
arrival
the
country
folks
did
like
it
because
we
imported
city
labor
they
hindered
our
efforts
the
women
were
abusive
to
my
wife
then
last
halloween
the
headless
horseman
clattered
over
this
bridge
could
it
have
been
a
holiday
prank
we
thought
so
at
first
but
a
month
later
the
same
thing
happened
again
this
time
the
scamp
tossed
a
pebble
against
our
bedroom
window
since
then
the
rider
has
been
coming
at
fairly
frequent
intervals
if
you
know
it
a
prank
why
should
it
worry
you
penny
inquired
a
thing
like
that
wears
one
down
after
awhile
the
owner
of
the
estate
said
wearily
for
myself
i
should
mind
but
my
wife
going
to
pieces
was
it
your
wife
we
heard
scream
louise
asked
seeking
to
keep
the
conversational
ball
rolling
yes
she
apt
to
go
off
the
deep
end
whenever
anyone
rides
fast
over
the
bridge
my
wife
burmaster
did
not
complete
what
he
had
intended
to
say
at
that
moment
a
soft
padding
of
footsteps
was
heard
a
creaking
of
boards
on
the
bridge
from
the
direction
of
the
house
came
a
tall
shadowy
figure
what
were
you
saying
about
me
john
the
voice
was
that
of
a
woman
shrill
and
strident
my
wife
murmured
the
estate
owner
he
turned
toward
her
matilda
he
said
gently
these
girls
are
strangers
to
the
valley
you
were
complaining
about
me
to
them
the
woman
accused
oh
you
need
deny
it
i
distinctly
heard
you
you
always
saying
things
to
hurt
my
feelings
you
do
care
how
i
suffer
is
it
enough
that
i
have
to
live
in
this
horrible
community
among
such
cruel
hateful
people
without
you
turning
against
me
too
please
matilda
do
me
apologize
at
once
why
certainly
i
apologize
burmaster
said
soothingly
i
was
only
telling
the
girls
how
nervous
it
makes
you
when
anyone
rides
at
a
fast
pace
over
the
bridge
and
why
should
i
be
nervous
the
woman
demanded
since
we
come
to
this
community
i
been
subjected
to
every
possible
insult
i
suppose
you
let
that
rider
get
away
again
he
was
only
a
mischievous
boy
i
do
care
who
he
was
the
woman
cried
i
want
him
caught
and
turned
over
to
the
authorities
i
want
everyone
who
rides
over
this
bridge
arrested
this
is
a
public
highway
matilda
when
we
built
this
footbridge
over
the
brook
we
had
to
grant
permission
for
pedestrians
and
horseback
riders
to
pass
then
make
them
change
the
ruling
are
you
the
richest
man
in
the
valley
or
does
that
mean
anything
burmaster
glanced
apologetically
at
penny
and
louise
the
girls
quite
taken
aback
by
the
woman
tirade
felt
rather
sorry
for
him
it
was
plain
to
see
that
burmaster
was
not
a
well
woman
her
sharp
angular
face
was
drawn
as
if
from
constant
worry
and
she
kept
patting
nervously
at
the
stiff
rolls
of
her
hair
well
i
guess
we
better
be
moving
on
penny
said
significantly
to
louise
yes
we
must
her
companion
agreed
with
alacrity
burmaster
is
lear
place
on
down
this
road
the
owner
of
sleepy
hollow
was
given
no
opportunity
to
answer
before
he
could
speak
his
wife
stepped
closer
glaring
up
at
louise
in
the
saddle
so
you
friends
of
mrs

she
demanded
mockingly
i
suppose
that
old
hag
sent
you
here
to
snoop
and
pry
and
annoy
me
goodness
no
gasped
louise
we
never
even
seen
the
woman
penny
added
silas
malcom
told
us
that
lear
might
give
us
a
room
for
the
night
silas
malcom
burmaster
seized
upon
the
name
he
another
who
tries
to
make
trouble
for
us
if
you
in
need
of
a
place
to
stay
we
be
glad
to
have
you
remain
with
us
burmaster
invited
we
have
plenty
of
room
burmaster
remained
silent
but
in
the
the
girls
saw
her
give
her
husband
a
quick
nudge
no
need
to
be
told
that
they
were
unwelcome
by
the
eccentric
mistress
of
sleepy
hollow
thank
you
we
could
possibly
stay
penny
said
gathering
up
the
reins
she
and
louise
walked
their
horses
single
file
over
the
creaking
bridge
just
as
they
reached
the
far
end
burmaster
called
to
them
pulling
up
they
waited
for
him
please
do
mind
my
wife
he
said
in
an
undertone
she
does
mean
half
what
she
says
we
understand
penny
assured
him
kindly
you
said
you
were
interested
in
the
headless
horseman
the
estate
owner
went
on
hurriedly
well
my
offer
holds
i
pay
a
liberal
reward
to
anyone
who
can
learn
the
identity
of
the
prankster
it
no
boy
i
sure
of
that
penny
replied
that
she
and
louise
would
like
to
help
if
they
knew
how
we
talk
about
that
part
later
on
burmaster
said
he
glanced
quickly
over
his
shoulder
observing
that
his
wife
was
coming
no
chance
now
you
stay
with
lear
tonight
if
she
take
us
in
oh
she
will
though
her
place
is
an
now
this
is
what
you
might
do
get
the
old
lady
to
talking
if
she
should
give
you
the
slightest
hint
who
the
prankster
is
seize
upon
it
then
you
think
lear
knows
i
suspect
half
the
community
does
burmaster
answered
bitterly
everyone
except
ourselves
we
hated
here
no
one
will
cooperate
with
us
penny
thought
over
the
request
she
did
not
like
the
idea
of
going
to
lear
home
to
spy
well
we
see
she
answered
without
making
a
definite
promise
burmaster
was
coming
across
the
bridge
not
wishing
to
talk
to
her
the
girls
bade
the
owner
of
sleepy
hollow
a
hasty
farewell
and
rode
away
once
on
the
turnpike
they
discussed
the
queer
mistress
of
the
estate
if
you
ask
me
everyone
in
this
community
is
queer
louise
grumbled
burmaster
just
seems
a
bit
more
so
than
the
others
intent
upon
reaching
the
lear
homestead
the
girls
kept
on
along
the
winding
highway
it
was
impossible
to
make
good
time
for
white
foot
kept
giving
louise
trouble
presently
the
mare
stopped
dead
in
her
tracks
then
wheeled
and
started
back
toward
the
burmaster
estate
louise
bouncing
helplessly
shrieked
to
her
chum
for
help
rein
her
in
penny
shouted
when
louise
seemed
unable
to
obey
penny
rode
bones
alongside
and
seized
the
reins
white
foot
then
stopped
willingly
enough
all
i
ask
of
life
is
to
get
off
this
creature
louise
half
sobbed
tired
enough
to
die
and
we
had
nothing
to
eat
since
noon
oh
brace
up
penny
encouraged
her
it
ca
be
much
farther
to
lear
place
i
lead
your
horse
for
awhile
seizing
the
reins
again
she
led
white
foot
down
the
road
at
a
walk
they
met
no
one
on
the
lonely
twisting
highway
the
only
sound
other
than
the
steady
clop
of
hoofbeats
was
an
occasional
guttural
twang
from
a
bullfrog
the
night
grew
darker
louise
began
to
shiver
though
not
so
much
from
cold
as
nervousness
her
gaze
constantly
roved
along
the
deep
woods
to
the
left
of
the
road
seeing
something
white
and
ghostly
amid
the
trees
she
called
penny
attention
to
it
why
it
nothing
penny
scoffed
just
an
old
tree
trunk
split
by
lightning
that
streak
of
white
is
the
inner
wood
showing
a
bend
in
the
road
lay
just
ahead
rounding
it
the
girls
saw
what
appeared
to
be
a
camp
fire
glowing
in
the
distance
the
wind
carried
a
strong
odor
of
wood
smoke
now
what
that
louise
asked
uneasily
someone
camping
along
the
road
i
can
see
a
house
on
ahead
penny
replied
the
bonfire
seems
to
have
been
built
in
the
yard
both
girls
were
convinced
that
they
were
approaching
the
lear
place
the
fire
however
puzzled
them
and
their
wonderment
grew
as
they
rode
closer
in
the
glare
of
the
leaping
flames
they
saw
a
huge
hanging
iron
kettle
a
dark
figure
hovered
over
it
stirring
the
contents
with
a
stick
involuntarily
penny
hand
tightened
on
the
reins
and
bones
stopped
louise
pulled
up
so
short
that
white
foot
nearly
reared
back
on
her
hind
legs
a
witch
penny
exclaimed
half
jubilantly
i
always
wanted
to
meet
one
and
this
is
our
chance
chapter
and
for
a
moment
the
two
girls
watched
in
awe
the
dark
grotesque
figure
silhouetted
against
the
leaping
flames
of
the
fire
a
woman
in
a
long
flowing
gown
kept
stirring
the
contents
of
the
iron
kettle
does
she
look
exactly
like
a
witch
penny
exclaimed
again
maybe
it
mrs
lear
if
that
the
lear
place
i
know
one
thing
louise
announced
dramatically
i
going
straight
on
to
delta
penny
knew
better
than
to
argue
with
her
chum
softly
she
quoted
from
macbeth
double
toil
and
trouble
fire
burn
and
cauldron
bubble
trouble
is
all
we
had
since
we
started
this
wild
trip
louise
broke
in
and
now
you
ask
me
to
spend
the
night
with
a
witch
not
so
loud
or
the
witch
may
hear
you
penny
cautioned
do
be
silly
lou
it
only
a
woman
out
in
her
back
yard
cooking
supper
at
this
time
of
night
well
it
is
a
bit
late
but
so
are
we
any
port
in
a
storm
come
along
louise
i
venture
that
whatever
is
cooking
in
that
kettle
will
be
good
penny
rode
on
and
louise
had
no
choice
but
to
follow
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
they
came
to
an
ancient
farmhouse
set
back
from
the
road
dismounting
the
girls
tied
their
horses
to
an
hitching
rack
near
the
sagging
gate
a
mailbox
bore
the
name
lear
this
is
the
place
all
right
said
penny
just
inside
the
gate
stood
an
ancient
domicile
that
by
daylight
was
shaded
by
a
giant
sycamore
built
of
small
bricks
it
had
latticed
windows
and
a
gabled
front
an
iron
weathercock
perched
on
the
curling
shingle
roof
seemed
to
gaze
saucily
down
at
the
girls
going
around
the
house
to
the
back
yard
penny
and
louise
again
came
within
view
of
the
blazing
fire
an
old
woman
in
a
long
black
dress
bent
over
the
kettle
which
hung
from
the
iron
crane
hearing
footsteps
she
glanced
up
alertly
who
is
it
she
called
and
the
crackled
voice
was
sharp
rather
than
friendly
silas
malcom
sent
us
here
penny
said
moving
into
the
arc
of
flickering
light
and
who
be
you
friends
o
his
the
woman
peered
intently
almost
suspiciously
at
the
two
girls
penny
gave
her
name
and
louise
adding
that
they
were
seeking
lodging
for
the
night
we
pay
of
course
she
added
the
old
woman
scrutinized
the
girls
for
so
long
that
they
were
certain
she
would
send
them
away
but
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
friendly
well
well
she
cackled
anybody
that
a
friend
of
silas
is
a
friend
of
mine
you
welcome
to
bed
and
board
fer
as
long
as
you
want
to
stay
penny
thanked
her
and
stepped
closer
to
the
kettle
we
not
had
anything
to
eat
since
noon
she
said
suggestively
my
whatever
cooking
looks
good
she
sniffed
at
the
steam
arising
from
the
iron
pot
and
backed
hastily
away
old
lear
broke
into
cackling
laughter
you
gals
do
want
none
that
this
here
is
soap
and
i
head
over
heels
in
it
that
why
workin
so
late
soap
repeated
penny
with
deep
respect
why
i
thought
soap
was
made
in
a
factory
lear
was
pleased
at
the
girl
interest
most
of
it
is
she
said
but
not
my
soap
this
here
is
homemade
soap
and
i
would
trade
a
cake
of
it
for
all
the
store
soap
ye
can
lug
home
not
for
heavy
cleanin
i
would
moving
near
enough
to
the
fire
to
see
the
greasy
mixture
bubbling
in
the
kettle
penny
asked
lear
if
she
would
explain
how
soap
was
made
bless
you
yes
the
old
lady
replied
with
enthusiasm
you
are
the
first
gal
i
ever
ran
across
that
was
interested
in
anything
as
old
fashioned
as
soap
makin
why
when
i
was
young
every
girl
knew
how
to
make
soap
and
was
proud
of
it
but
nowdays
all
the
girls
think
about
is
gaddin
and
dancin
and
having
dates
with
some
worthless
come
right
up
to
the
fire
and
i
show
you
something
about
soap
makin
lear
poked
the
glowing
logs
beneath
the
kettle
first
thing
she
explained
is
to
get
your
fire
good
and
hot
then
you
add
your
scrap
grease
what
is
scrap
grease
louise
asked
greatly
intrigued
why
bless
you
child
that
the
odds
and
ends
of
cookin
that
most
folks
throw
away
not
me
though
i
make
soap
of
it
even
if
it
ai
so
good
smellin
it
better
soap
than
you
can
buy
the
girls
looked
over
the
rim
of
the
steaming
kettle
and
saw
a
quantity
of
bubbling
fats
with
surprising
dexterity
for
one
of
her
age
lear
inserted
a
paddle
and
stirred
the
mixture
vigorously
next
thing
ye
do
is
to
cook
in
the
lye
she
instructed
then
you
let
it
cool
off
and
slice
it
to
any
size
you
want
this
mess
soon
be
ready
and
that
all
there
is
to
making
soap
penny
said
a
bit
amazed
in
spite
of
herself
all
but
a
little
elbow
grease
and
some
git
up
and
git
the
old
lady
chuckled
them
two
commodities
are
mighty
scarce
these
days
while
the
girls
watched
lear
poured
off
the
soap
mixture
she
would
not
allow
them
to
help
lest
they
burn
themselves
i
kin
tell
that
you
girls
are
all
tuckered
out
she
said
when
the
task
was
finished
just
put
your
horses
in
the
barn
and
toss
some
corn
and
hay
while
you
gone
i
clean
up
these
soap
makin
things
and
start
a
mess
o
victuals
cookin
lear
waved
a
bony
hand
toward
a
large
unpainted
outbuilding
louise
and
penny
led
their
horses
to
it
opening
the
creaking
old
barn
door
somewhat
cautiously
a
sound
they
could
not
instantly
identify
greeted
their
ears
what
was
that
louise
whispered
holding
back
only
a
horse
gnawing
corn
penny
chuckled
lear
must
keep
a
steed
of
her
own
it
was
dark
in
the
barn
even
with
the
doors
left
wide
open
groping
their
way
to
empty
stalls
the
girls
unsaddled
and
tied
the
horses
up
for
the
night
lear
animal
they
noted
was
a
animal
evidently
a
thoroughbred
a
riding
horse
too
penny
remarked
wonder
how
she
can
afford
to
keep
it
finding
corn
in
the
bin
the
girls
fed
bones
and
white
foot
and
forked
them
an
ample
supply
of
hay
now
to
feed
ourselves
penny
sighed
as
they
left
the
barn
my
stomach
feels
as
empty
as
the
grand
canyon
the
girls
had
visions
of
a
bountiful
supper
cooked
over
the
camp
fire
however
lear
was
putting
out
the
glowing
coals
with
a
bucket
of
water
come
into
the
house
she
urged
it
wo
take
me
long
to
git
a
meal
knocked
up
that
is
if
you
ai
too
particular
anything
suits
us
louise
assured
her
and
the
more
of
it
the
better
penny
muttered
though
under
her
breath
lear
led
the
way
to
the
house
advising
the
girls
to
wait
at
the
door
until
she
could
light
a
kerosene
lamp
by
its
ruddy
glow
they
saw
a
kitchen
very
meagerly
furnished
with
cook
stove
a
homemade
table
and
a
few
chairs
while
you
washin
up
i
put
on
some
victuals
to
cook
lear
said
showing
the
girls
a
wash
basin
and
pitcher
it
wo
take
me
a
minute
with
a
speed
that
was
amazing
the
old
lady
lighted
the
cook
stove
and
soon
had
a
bed
of
glowing
coals
she
warmed
up
a
pan
of
potatoes
fried
salt
pork
and
hominy
from
a
pantry
shelf
she
brought
wild
grape
jelly
and
a
loaf
of
homemade
bread
to
complete
the
meal
she
set
before
the
girls
a
pitcher
of
milk
and
a
great
glass
dish
brimming
with
canned
peaches
it
ai
much
she
apologized
food
never
looked
better
penny
declared
drawing
a
chair
to
the
kitchen
table
it
a
marvelous
supper
louise
added
her
eyes
fairly
caressing
the
food
lear
sat
down
at
the
table
with
the
girls
and
seemed
to
take
keen
delight
in
watching
them
eat
whenever
their
appetites
lagged
for
an
instant
she
would
pass
them
another
dish
now
that
you
et
tell
me
who
you
are
and
why
you
came
lear
urged
after
the
girls
had
finished
you
say
silas
sent
you
good
food
had
stimulated
penny
and
louise
and
made
them
in
a
talkative
mood
they
told
of
their
long
trip
from
riverview
and
almost
before
they
realized
it
had
spoken
of
the
headless
horseman
lear
listened
attentively
her
watery
blue
eyes
dancing
with
interest
suddenly
penny
cut
her
story
short
conscious
that
the
old
lady
deliberately
was
pumping
her
of
information
so
you
like
to
collect
burmaster
reward
lear
chuckled
we
should
mind
penny
admitted
besides
we
be
doing
the
burmasters
a
good
turn
to
help
them
get
rid
of
their
ghost
rider
that
you
would
agreed
the
old
lady
exactly
as
if
the
burmasters
were
her
best
friends
yes
indeed
you
come
in
a
good
cause
then
perhaps
you
can
help
us
louise
said
eagerly
you
must
have
heard
about
the
headless
horseman
lear
nodded
brightly
perhaps
you
know
who
the
person
is
penny
added
maybe
maybe
not
lear
shrugged
and
getting
quickly
up
began
to
carry
the
dishes
to
the
sink
the
firm
tilt
of
her
thin
chin
warned
the
girls
that
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
the
topic
was
closed
rather
baffled
penny
and
louise
made
a
feeble
attempt
to
reopen
the
conversation
failing
they
offered
to
wipe
the
dishes
for
their
hostess
oh
it
ai
no
bother
to
do
myself
lear
said
shooing
them
away
you
both
look
tired
enough
to
drop
just
go
up
to
the
spare
bedroom
and
slip
beneath
the
covers
louise
and
penny
needed
no
further
urging
carrying
their
knapsacks
and
a
lamp
lear
gave
them
they
stumbled
up
the
stairs
the
spare
bedroom
was
a
huge
rather
cold
chamber
furnished
with
a
giant
fourposter
bed
and
a
chest
of
drawers
the
only
floor
covering
was
a
homemade
rag
rug
louise
quickly
undressed
and
left
penny
to
blow
out
the
light
the
latter
moving
to
the
latticed
window
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
out
across
the
moonlit
fields
toward
the
burmaster
estate
nothing
makes
sense
about
this
trip
she
remarked
from
the
bed
came
a
muffled
now
you
talking
ignoring
the
jibe
penny
resumed
did
you
notice
how
lear
acted
just
as
if
the
burmasters
were
her
friends
perhaps
she
did
that
to
throw
us
off
the
track
she
asked
us
plenty
of
questions
but
she
did
tell
us
one
thing
yet
she
knows
plenty
i
convinced
of
that
oh
come
on
to
bed
louise
pleaded
yawning
ca
you
do
your
speculating
in
the
morning
with
a
laugh
penny
leaped
into
the
very
center
of
the
feather
bed
missing
her
chum
anatomy
by
inches
soon
lear
came
upstairs
she
tapped
softly
on
the
door
and
inquired
if
the
girls
had
plenty
of
covers
assured
that
they
were
comfortable
she
went
on
down
the
hall
to
her
own
room
worn
from
the
long
horseback
ride
louise
fell
asleep
almost
at
once
penny
felt
too
excited
to
be
drowsy
she
lay
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
reflecting
upon
the
day
events
so
far
the
journey
to
the
valley
had
netted
little
more
than
sore
muscles
yet
there

and
intrigue
here
i
know
it
penny
thought
if
only
i
could
get
a
little
tangible
information
an
hour
elapsed
and
still
the
girl
could
not
sleep
as
she
stirred
restlessly
she
heard
lear
bedroom
door
softly
creak
in
the
hallway
boards
began
to
tremble
penny
stiffened
listening
distinctly
she
could
hear
someone
tiptoeing
past
her
door
to
the
stairway
that
must
be
lear
she
thought
but
what
can
she
be
doing
up
at
this
time
of
night
the
question
did
not
long
remain
unanswered
boards
squeaked
steadily
as
the
old
lady
descended
the
stairs
a
little
silence
then
penny
heard
two
long
rings
and
a
short
one
lear
is
calling
someone
on
the
telephone
she
identified
the
sound
lear
squeaky
voice
carried
clearly
up
the
stairway
through
the
half
open
bedroom
door
that
you
silas
penny
heard
her
say
well
those
gals
got
here
just
as
you
said
they
would
first
off
they
asked
me
about
the
headless
horseman
a
slight
pause
followed
before
lear
added
do
you
worry
none
silas
just
count
on
me
they
handle
soft
as
kittens
and
as
she
ended
the
telephone
conversation
the
old
lady
broke
into
cackling
laughter
chapter
rich
man
rain
was
drumming
on
the
roof
when
penny
awakened
the
next
morning
yawning
sleepily
she
sat
up
in
bed
beside
her
louise
curled
into
a
tight
ball
slumbered
undisturbed
but
not
for
long
penny
tickled
an
exposed
foot
until
she
opened
her
eyes
get
up
lou
she
ordered
pleasantly
we
overslept
oh
it
still
night
louise
grumbled
trying
to
snuggle
beneath
the
covers
again
penny
stripped
off
all
the
blankets
and
pulled
her
chum
from
the
bed
it
only
so
dark
because
it
raining
she
explained
anyway
i
have
something
important
to
tell
you
as
the
girls
dressed
in
the
cold
bedroom
penny
told
louise
of
the
telephone
conversation
she
had
heard
the
previous
night
lear
was
talking
to
silas
malcom
i
sure
she
concluded
and
about
us
too
she
said
we
handle
very
easily
louise
eyes
opened
a
trifle
wider
then
you
figure
silas
malcom
intended
to
get
us
here
on
purpose
i
beginning
to
think
so
but
why
do
ask
me
penny
said
with
a
shrug
these
valley
folk
are
simple
by
any
means
unless
we
watch
our
step
they
may
take
us
for
a
merry
ride
not
with
the
headless
horseman
i
hope
louise
chuckled
why
do
we
go
home
this
morning
and
forget
the
whole
silly
affair
penny
shook
her
head
i
sticking
until
i
find
out
what
going
on
here
she
announced
it
might
mean
a
story
for
dad
paper
oh
that
only
your
excuse
louise
teased
you
know
you
never
could
resist
a
mystery
and
this
one
certainly
has
baffling
angles
the
girls
washed
in
a
basin
of
cold
water
and
then
went
downstairs
lear
was
baking
pancakes
in
the
warm
kitchen
she
flipped
one
neatly
as
she
reached
with
the
other
hand
to
remove
the
coffee
pot
from
the
stove
good
morning
she
chirped
did
you
sleep
right
last
night
penny
and
louise
agreed
that
they
had
and
edged
close
to
the
stove
for
warmth
an
clock
on
the
mantel
showed
that
it
was
only
eight
but
eight
for
lear
was
a
late
hour
judging
by
the
amount
of
work
she
had
done
a
row
of
glass
jars
stood
on
the
table
filled
with
canned
plums
and
peaches
you
have
put
up
all
that
fruit
this
morning
gasped
louise
lear
admitted
that
she
had
but
that
ai
much
she
added
modestly
only
a
bushel
and
a
half
wo
hardly
last
no
time
at
all
lear
cleared
off
the
kitchen
table
set
it
in
a
twinkling
and
placed
before
the
girls
a
huge
mound
of
stacked
cakes
now
eat
hearty
she
advised
i
had
mine
hours
ago
as
penny
ate
she
sought
to
draw
a
little
information
from
the
eccentric
old
woman
deliberately
she
brought
up
the
subject
of
the
burmaster
family
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
lear
asked
smiling
wisely
why
is
burmaster
so
disliked
in
the
community
because
she
a
scheming
trouble
maker
if
there
ever
was
one
the
old
lady
replied
promptly
burmaster
ai
so
bad
only
he
pulled
around
by
the
nose
by
that
weepin
whinin
wife
of
his
burmaster
seems
to
think
that
the
valley
folk
treat
her
cruelly
she
should
talk
about
being
cruel
lear
dark
eyes
flashed
you
know
what
them
burmasters
done
only
in
a
general
way
well
they
come
here
and
forced
folks
to
git
off
the
land
did
burmaster
pay
for
what
he
bought
oh
it
was
done
legal
lear
admitted
grudgingly
you
see
most
this
valley
was
owned
by
a
man
in
the
east
he
rented
it
out
in
parcels
an
never
bothered
anyone
even
if
they
was
behind
in
their
payments
then
burmaster
bought
the
entire
track
of
land
from
the
eastern
owner
inquired
penny
that
right
all
except
these
here
four
acres
where
my
house
sets
they
ai
nothin
in
this
world
that
will
git
me
in
a
mood
to
sell
to
that
old
skinflint
he
tried
every
trick
in
the
bag
already
penny
thoughtfully
reached
for
another
pancake
as
an
impartial
judge
she
could
see
that
there
was
something
to
be
said
on
both
sides
of
the
question
burmaster
had
purchased
his
land
legally
and
so
could
not
be
blamed
for
asking
the
former
renters
to
move
yet
she
sympathized
with
the
farmers
who
for
so
many
years
had
considered
the
valley
their
own
this
house
o
mine
ai
much
to
look
at
lear
commented
reflectively
but
it
been
home
fer
a
long
time
ai
nobody
going
to
get
me
out
o
here
you
own
your
own
land
inquired
louise
that
i
do
nodded
lear
proudly
i
got
the
deed
hid
under
my
bed
mattress
wo
you
tell
us
about
burmaster
difficulty
with
the
headless
horseman
penny
urged
feeling
that
the
old
lady
was
in
a
talkative
mood
what
do
you
want
to
know
lear
asked
cautiously
is
there
really
such
a
thing
or
is
it
just
a
story
if
you
girls
stay
in
this
valley
long
enough
you
learn
fer
yourselves
lear
chuckled
i
warrant
you
see
that
horseman
and
you
know
who
the
prankster
is
penny
ventured
daringly
maybe
i
do
lear
admitted
with
a
chuckle
but
a
team
could
pry
it
out
o
me
and
neither
can
you
before
penny
could
resume
the
subject
chickens
began
to
squawk
and
scatter
in
the
barn
yard
a
large
expensive
looking
car
pulled
up
near
the
side
door
lear
peeped
out
of
a
window
and
her
jaw
set
in
a
firm
hard
line
that
burmaster
now
she
announced
in
a
stage
whisper
well
he
ai
goin
to
pressure
me
no
sir
i
give
him
as
good
as
he
sends
after
burmaster
pounded
on
the
kitchen
door
the
old
lady
took
her
time
before
she
let
him
in
good
morning
he
said
brightly
humph
what
good
about
it
lear
shot
back
it
rainin
it
and
if
we
git
much
more
o
it
this
fall
the
dam
up
huntley
goin
to
let
go
shore
as
i
a
standin
here
nonsense
replied
the
estate
owner
impatiently
he
stepped
into
the
kitchen
seeing
penny
and
louise
he
looked
rather
surprised
and
a
trifle
embarrassed
go
on
and
say
what
you
come
to
say
lear
encouraged
do
stand
on
no
ceremony
jus
cause
i
got
city
visitors
obviously
burmaster
did
not
like
to
speak
before
strangers
but
there
was
no
other
way
you
know
why
i
am
here
lear
he
began
i
already
made
several
offers
for
your
property
and
i
turned
all
down
yes
but
this
time
i
hope
you
listen
to
reason
last
night
my
wife
had
a
near
collapse
after
a
boy
rode
a
horse
across
the
bridge
by
our
house
all
this
stupid
talk
about
headless
horsemen
has
inspired
the
community
to
do
mischief
now
every
boy
in
the
valley
is
trying
pranks
then
why
not
ketch
the
horseman
and
put
an
end
to
it
lear
asked
impudently
nothing
would
please
me
better
but
we
had
no
success
my
wife
endure
the
strain
much
longer
it
driving
her
to
a
frenzy
i
sorry
about
that
replied
lear
stonily
there
ai
nothin
i
can
do
i
want
you
to
sell
this
property
burmaster
pleaded
at
least
that
will
remove
one
irritation
you
see
my
wife
considers
the
place
an
eyesore
she
can
see
your
house
from
our
living
room
window
it
ruins
an
otherwise
perfect
view
of
the
valley
now
ai
that
too
bad
lear
tone
was
sarcastic
well
let
me
tell
you
somethin
that
place
o
yorn
spoils
my
view
too
i
afraid
i
have
made
myself
clear
burmaster
said
hastily
it
a
matter
of
my
wife
health
your
wife
ai
no
more
ailin
than
i
be
lear
retorted
if
she
did
have
my
house
to
bother
her
it
would
be
somethin
else
i
goin
to
sell
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
you
not
heard
my
offer
i
give
you
two
thousand
dollars
for
this
place
cash
lear
looked
a
trifle
stunned
at
best
the
place
is
worth
five
hundred
burmaster
resumed
but
i
aim
to
be
generous
i
wo
sell
lear
said
firmly
not
at
any
price
them
my
final
words
burmaster
had
kept
his
voice
carefully
controlled
but
the
old
decision
angered
him
you
regret
this
he
said
in
a
harsh
tone
i
been
very
patient
but
i
warn
you
from
now
on
i
shall
act
in
my
own
interests
have
you
ever
acted
in
any
other
drawled
a
voice
from
behind
the
estate
owner
everyone
turned
quickly
joe
quigley
the
young
station
agent
stood
framed
in
the
open
doorway
smiling
at
burmaster
in
a
grim
way
he
came
slowly
into
the
kitchen
chapter
from
the
a
silence
had
fallen
upon
those
in
the
room
joe
quigley
shook
rain
drops
from
his
overcoat
deliberately
he
took
his
time
hanging
the
coat
over
a
chair
in
front
of
the
cook
stove
then
still
smiling
in
an
ironic
way
he
faced
burmaster
i
repeat
he
challenged
did
you
ever
act
in
any
manner
except
for
your
own
interest
you
are
insulting
insolent
burmaster
snapped
but
i
not
be
drawn
into
an
argument
with
you
good
morning
quigley
blocked
the
door
not
so
fast
he
drawled
matter
of
fact
i
was
on
my
way
to
your
house
saw
your
car
standing
in
lear
yard
so
i
figured
you
were
here
if
you
have
a
telegram
for
me
i
take
it
the
only
message
i
have
is
a
verbal
one
answered
quigley
our
mayor
from
delta
bradley
mason
asked
me
to
talk
to
you
about
the
huntley
dam
the
subject
does
interest
me
it
should
interest
every
man
woman
and
child
in
this
valley
quigley
retorted
if
the
dam
gives
way
flood
waters
will
sweep
straight
down
the
valley
your
house
would
be
destroyed
before
you
knew
there
was
any
danger
really
burmaster
smile
was
a
sneer
let
me
worry
about
my
own
property
as
a
matter
of
record
i
do
lose
any
sleep
over
you
quigley
responded
heatedly
but
i
am
thinking
about
lear
and
the
people
living
in
delta
not
to
mention
the
towns
on
down
the
line
which
would
be
in
the
direct
path
of
the
flood
if
the
good
people
of
delta
are
endangered
why
do
they
repair
the
dam
themselves
for
the
reason
that
we
ca
raise
the
money
we
tried
then
the
state
should
act
in
the
matter
i
willing
to
write
my
senator
repairs
are
needed
now
not
three
months
later
burmaster
you
have
the
money
and
you
be
doing
the
community
a
great
service
to
lend
help
we
not
asking
for
a
donation
it
as
much
to
your
interest
as
ours
to
protect
the
valley
there
no
danger
burmaster
said
angrily
not
a
particle
it
only
a
scheme
to
shake
me
down
for
money
brushing
past
the
station
agent
the
man
went
out
into
the
rain
in
driving
out
of
the
yard
he
turned
the
car
so
sharply
that
it
skidded
on
its
wheels
well
that
that
quigley
remarked
with
a
shrug
i
should
have
saved
my
breath
i
glad
gone
lear
announced
tartly
will
you
have
a
bite
o
breakfast
joe
no
thanks
the
young
station
agent
replied
i
due
for
my
trick
at
the
depot
in
twenty
minutes
have
to
run
along
the
girls
were
sorry
to
see
joe
quigley
go
so
soon
for
they
had
hoped
to
have
a
long
talk
with
him
after
he
had
disappeared
into
the
rain
they
tried
without
much
success
to
draw
more
information
from
lear
the
old
lady
was
in
no
mood
to
discuss
the
burmasters
but
she
did
have
a
great
deal
to
say
about
flood
danger
to
the
valley
usual
that
we
have
so
much
rain
she
declared
not
at
this
time
o
year
old
red
river
floodin
to
the
brim
an
keeps
pourin
more
and
more
into
the
huntley
lake
basin
the
dam
there
was
built
years
ago
and
it
was
much
to
brag
on
from
the
start
have
authorities
inspected
the
dam
recently
penny
inquired
thoughtfully
oh
some
young
whippersnapper
come
here
a
month
ago
and
took
a
quick
look
and
said
the
dam
would
hold
lear
replied
tossing
her
head
but
he
ai
livin
in
the
valley
we
want
repairs
made
and
we
want
quick
not
next
year
since
burmaster
refuses
to
help
is
there
nothing
that
can
be
done
there
some
as
thinks
a
little
piece
in
the
city
papers
might
help
lear
said
giving
penny
a
quick
shrewd
glance
your
pa
a
newspaper
owner
ai
he
yes
he
owns
the
penny
gazed
across
the
table
at
louise
it
struck
both
girls
that
lear
was
very
well
informed
about
their
affairs
how
had
the
old
lady
learned
that
parker
was
a
newspaper
man
if
not
from
silas
malcom
more
than
ever
penny
was
convinced
that
she
had
been
lured
to
red
valley
perhaps
for
the
purpose
of
interesting
her
famous
father
in
the
huntley
dam
project
you
been
very
kind
lear
she
said
abruptly
arising
from
the
table
louise
and
i
appreciate
your
hospitality
however
we
want
to
pay
for
our
room
and
meals
before
we
go
you
do
owe
me
a
penny
the
old
lady
laughed
furthermore
you
leavin
yet
we
must
there
an
afternoon
train
and
there
be
another
along
tomorrow
why
you
catch
your
death
cold
ridin
hoss
back
all
the
way
to
hobostein
the
rain
should
let
up
soon
it
should
but
it
wo
lear
declared
why
do
you
stay
until
tomorror
anyhow
then
you
could
go
to
the
barn
dance
tonight
at
place
at
the
moment
the
girls
were
not
greatly
intrigued
at
the
prospect
of
attending
a
barn
dance
the
steady
rain
had
depressed
them
though
the
long
journey
to
red
valley
had
proven
interesting
it
scarcely
seemed
worth
the
exhausting
effort
they
had
learned
very
little
about
the
headless
horseman
and
doubted
that
any
truly
valuable
information
would
come
their
way
if
you
stay
over
maybe
you
git
a
chance
to
see
that
ghost
lear
said
slyly
seems
like
it
mostly
on
bad
nights
that
he
does
his
prowlin
the
girls
helped
with
the
dishes
they
made
the
bed
and
watched
lear
sew
on
a
rag
rug
at
intervals
they
wandered
to
the
windows
rain
fell
steadily
showing
not
the
slightest
sign
of
a
let
up
did
i
tell
you
lear
said
gleefully
it
settlin
for
a
good
healthy
pour
you
might
jest
as
well
calculate
on
stayin
another
night
but
our
parents
will
be
expecting
us
home
louise
protested
send
a
wire
from
delta
lear
urged
reckon
this
rain
maybe
slacken
a
bit
come
afternoon
throughout
the
long
morning
louise
and
penny
wandered
restlessly
about
the
house
now
and
then
they
sought
without
success
to
draw
information
from
lear
about
the
mysterious
prankster
from
the
merry
twinkle
in
her
eyes
they
were
convinced
she
knew
a
great
deal
pry
it
from
her
they
could
not
maybe
that
headless
horseman
ai
nobody
human
she
chuckled
maybe
it
a
real
haunt
i
mind
the
time
somebody
witched
my
cow
the
stubborn
critter
did
give
no
milk
for
eight
days
steady
penny
and
louise
were
sure
whether
the
old
lady
was
serious
or
trying
to
tease
them
after
awhile
they
gave
up
attempting
to
solve
such
an
enigma
by
noon
they
had
reconciled
themselves
to
staying
another
night
at
red
valley
however
scarcely
had
they
made
their
decision
to
remain
than
the
sky
cleared
we
stuck
here
anyway
penny
sighed
we
could
possibly
ride
our
horses
back
to
hobostein
in
time
to
catch
the
afternoon
train
after
luncheon
the
girls
hiked
to
the
picturesque
little
town
of
delta
there
they
dropped
in
at
the
depot
to
chat
with
joe
quigley
and
send
a
telegram
to
their
parents
if
time
heavy
on
your
hands
why
not
take
a
little
jaunt
to
the
huntley
dam
the
station
agent
suggested
it
should
be
well
worth
your
time
penny
and
louise
decided
to
do
just
that
at
lear
once
more
they
saddled
their
horses
and
took
the
pike
road
to
a
trail
which
led
up
into
the
hills
ditches
were
brimming
with
fast
running
water
yet
there
was
no
other
evidence
of
flood
do
you
suppose
all
this
talk
about
the
dam
being
weak
is
just
talk
penny
speculated
as
they
rode
along
in
case
of
real
danger
one
would
think
state
authorities
would
step
into
the
picture
soon
the
girls
came
to
the
winding
red
river
swollen
by
the
fall
rains
the
current
raced
madly
over
rocks
and
stones
the
roar
of
rushing
water
warned
them
that
they
were
close
to
the
dam
in
another
moment
they
glimpsed
a
mighty
torrent
of
water
pouring
in
a
silvery
white
ribbon
over
the
high
barrier
men
could
be
seen
working
doggedly
as
they
piled
sandbag
upon
sandbag
to
strengthen
the
weakened
structure
suddenly
penny
noticed
a
man
and
woman
who
wore
raincoats
watching
the
workmen
lou
there
and
mrs
burmaster
she
exclaimed
they
drove
closer
to
the
dam
and
burmaster
were
talking
so
earnestly
together
that
they
did
not
observe
the
newcomers
the
roar
of
water
drowned
the
sound
of
hoofbeats
but
the
wind
blew
directly
toward
the
girls
burmaster
voice
shrill
and
angrily
came
to
them
clearly
you
ca
do
it
john
i
wo
allow
it
she
admonished
her
husband
you
not
to
give
the
people
of
this
valley
one
penny
the
dam
is
perfectly
safe
i
not
so
sure
he
said
pointing
to
the
far
side
of
the
structure
as
he
spoke
a
tiny
portion
of
the
dam
seemed
to
melt
away
the
girls
watching
tensely
saw
several
sandbags
swept
over
the
brink
workmen
raced
to
repair
the
damage
burmaster
seemed
stunned
by
the
sight
but
only
for
an
instant
i
do
care
she
cried
not
a
penny
of
our
money
goes
into
this
dam
it
will
hold
anyway
i
rather
drown
than
be
bested
by
that
hateful
old
lady
lear
but
matilda
do
speak
to
me
of
it
again
get
her
out
of
this
valley
tear
down
her
shack
if
you
do
i
warn
you
i
take
matters
into
my
own
hands
turning
abruptly
burmaster
walked
angrily
down
the
trail
chapter
burmaster
was
too
distracted
to
pay
heed
to
penny
and
louise
brushing
past
them
he
hastened
after
his
wife
neither
of
the
girls
commented
upon
the
conversation
they
had
overheard
for
a
long
while
they
sat
on
their
horses
gazing
in
awe
at
the
tumbling
water
if
ever
that
dam
should
let
go
penny
shuddered
why
the
valley
would
be
flooded
in
just
a
few
minutes
i
doubt
folks
could
be
warned
in
time
it
looks
as
if
it
could
give
way
any
second
too
louise
added
uneasily
why
do
we
get
out
of
this
valley
and
stay
away
and
forget
the
mystery
a
lot
of
good
a
mystery
would
do
us
if
that
dam
lets
go
penny
we
were
crazy
to
come
here
in
the
first
place
but
i
want
to
get
a
big
story
for
dad
paper
there
one
here
i
know
not
what
course
others
may
take
louise
quoted
grandly
as
for
myself
i
going
home
on
tomorrow
train
rain
or
shine
we
both
have
to
go
penny
agreed
in
a
discouraged
tone
i
had
my
chance
here
but
somehow
i
muffed
it
for
a
half
hour
longer
the
girls
remained
at
the
dam
watching
the
workmen
presently
returning
to
the
lear
cottage
they
found
lear
in
the
warm
kitchen
cooking
supper
i
settin
the
victuals
on
early
tonight
she
announced
we
ai
got
any
too
much
time
to
git
to
the
frolic
at
silas
place
penny
and
louise
were
not
sure
that
they
cared
to
attend
the
barn
dance
lear
however
was
deaf
to
all
excuses
she
whisked
supper
onto
the
table
and
the
instant
dishes
were
done
said
that
she
would
hitch
trinidad
to
the
buggy
it
wo
take
us
long
to
git
there
she
encouraged
the
girls
as
they
reluctantly
followed
her
to
the
barn
trinidad
a
fast
critter
best
horse
in
the
county
fer
that
matter
soon
the
ancient
buggy
was
rattling
at
a
brisk
clip
along
the
winding
woodland
road
lear
allowed
trinidad
to
slacken
pace
as
they
neared
the
burmaster
estate
look
at
that
house
she
chortled
waving
her
buggy
whip
every
light
in
the
place
lit
up
know
why
burmaster
afeared
o
her
shadder
come
dark
and
she
skeared
to
stick
her
nose
out
the
door
you
do
seem
to
be
afraid
of
anything
penny
remarked
in
admiration
me
afeared
the
old
lady
laughed
gleefully
what
there
to
be
skeared
of
well
perhaps
a
certain
headless
horseman
lear
hooted
if
i
was
to
see
that
critter
right
now
and
he
had
twenty
heads
i
would
even
bat
an
eye
horse
and
buggy
approached
the
giant
tulip
tree
whose
gnarled
branches
were
twisted
into
fantastic
shapes
see
that
tree
lear
demanded
in
revolutionary
days
a
traitor
was
hanged
from
that
lower
limb
sometimes
you
kin
still
hear
his
spirit
sighin
and
moanin
you
mean
the
wind
whistling
through
the
tree
limbs
penny
supplied
did
sound
like
wind
to
me
lear
corrected
with
a
grin
some
that
afeared
to
pass
under
this
tree
come
night
but
not
me
the
buggy
rattled
on
its
top
brushing
against
the
overhanging
branches
of
the
giant
tulip
it
had
grown
very
dark
and
the
shadows
of
the
woods
had
a
depressing
effect
upon
the
girls
they
were
glad
to
see
the
lights
of
the
malcom
place
on
the
hill
and
even
more
pleased
to
drive
into
the
yard
you
gals
go
right
on
in
lear
advised
leaping
lightly
from
the
buggy
i
look
after
trinidad
the
barn
dance
already
was
in
progress
crossing
the
yard
the
girls
could
hear
gay
laughter
above
the
lively
squeak
of
fiddles
through
the
open
barn
door
they
glimpsed
a
throng
of
young
people
whirling
in
the
intricate
steps
of
a
square
dance
we
certain
to
be
wall
flowers
at
a
party
such
as
this
louise
remarked
sadly
the
girls
found
themselves
a
quiet
corner
from
which
to
watch
the
merrymakers
however
they
were
not
permitted
to
remain
there
at
the
end
of
the
first
dance
joe
quigley
came
to
ask
penny
for
a
dance
to
louise
secret
joy
he
brought
along
a
young
man
who
promptly
invited
her
to
be
his
partner
but
we
do
know
how
to
square
dance
penny
protested
wo
take
you
long
to
learn
joe
chuckled
pulling
her
to
her
feet
the
fiddler
broke
into
a
lively
tune
silas
malcom
acting
as
caller
shouted
boisterous
directions
to
the
dancers
balance
all
balance
eight
swing
like
on
a
gate
joe
quigley
expert
dancer
that
he
was
fairly
swept
penny
through
the
intricate
formations
before
she
hardly
was
aware
of
it
the
dance
was
over
and
silas
called
out
meet
your
partner
and
promenade
home
after
that
the
girls
did
not
lack
for
partners
the
night
sped
on
magic
wings
penny
danced
many
times
with
joe
and
ate
supper
with
him
then
noticing
that
the
party
was
starting
to
break
up
she
looked
about
for
lear
the
old
lady
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
nor
could
louise
recall
having
seen
her
for
the
past
half
hour
somewhat
disturbed
they
crossed
the
room
to
talk
to
old
silas
malcom
lear
went
home
a
good
hour
ago
he
told
them
she
said
she
had
to
git
some
sleep
but
you
gals
was
havin
so
much
fun
she
did
have
the
heart
to
take
you
away
penny
and
louise
could
not
hide
their
consternation
with
lear
gone
they
would
have
no
way
of
getting
back
to
the
cottage
do
you
worry
none
old
silas
chuckled
joe
quigley
will
take
you
home
an
if
he
do
there
plenty
o
young
bucks
waitin
fer
the
chanst
the
arrangement
was
not
in
the
least
to
the
girls
liking
the
party
they
could
see
rapidly
was
breaking
up
joe
quigley
seemed
to
have
disappeared
nearly
all
of
the
girls
except
themselves
were
supplied
with
escorts
i
do
like
this
not
by
a
little
bit
penny
muttered
let
get
out
of
here
lou
how
will
we
get
back
to
lear
place
walk
without
an
escort
it
not
far
we
have
to
pass
the
burmaster
place
and
that
horrid
tulip
tree
who
afraid
of
a
tulip
tree
penny
laughed
come
on
if
we
do
get
away
quickly
old
silas
will
ask
some
young
man
to
take
us
home
that
would
be
humiliating
louise
reluctantly
followed
her
chum
the
girls
obtained
their
wraps
and
without
attracting
attention
slipped
out
a
side
door
why
do
you
suppose
lear
slipped
off
without
saying
a
word
louise
complained
as
she
and
penny
walked
rapidly
along
the
dark
muddy
road
our
shoes
will
be
ruined
so
is
my
ego
penny
added
irritably
joe
quigley
certainly
let
us
down
too
he
was
attentive
enough
until
after
supper
then
he
simply
vanished
the
night
was
very
dark
for
driving
clouds
had
blotted
out
the
stars
overhanging
trees
cast
a
cavernous
gloom
upon
the
twisting
hillside
road
louise
caught
herself
shivering
sternly
she
told
herself
that
it
came
from
the
cold
air
rather
than
nervousness
presently
the
girls
approached
the
burmaster
estate
no
lights
were
burning
but
the
rambling
building
loomed
up
white
and
through
the
trees
i
breathe
natural
when
we
across
the
bridge
penny
admitted
with
a
laugh
if
burmaster
keeps
a
guard
hidden
in
the
bushes
the
fellow
might
heave
a
rock
at
us
on
general
principles
there
was
no
sign
of
anyone
near
the
estate
yet
both
penny
and
louise
sensed
that
they
were
being
watched
the
unpleasant
sensation
of
uneasiness
increased
as
they
drew
nearer
the
foot
bridge
penny
i
scared
louise
suddenly
admitted
of
what
penny
asked
with
forced
cheerfulness
it
too
quiet
the
words
died
on
louise
lips
unexpectedly
the
stillness
of
the
night
was
broken
by
the
clatter
of
hoofbeats
startled
the
girls
whirled
around
a
horse
with
a
rider
had
plunged
through
the
dense
bushes
only
a
short
distance
behind
them
at
a
hard
run
he
came
straight
toward
the
foot
bridge
the
ghost
rider
louise
whispered
in
terror
she
and
penny
stood
frozen
in
their
tracks
plainly
they
could
see
the
figure
his
lumpy
misshapen
hulk
seemed
rigidly
fastened
to
the
horse
where
his
head
should
have
been
there
was
only
a
stub
chapter
headless
swift
as
the
wind
the
headless
horseman
approached
the
narrow
bridge
penny
seized
louise
hand
jerking
her
off
the
road
the
ghost
rider
thundered
past
them
onto
the
bridge
planks
which
resounded
beneath
the
hoofs
jeepers
creepers
penny
whispered
that
no
boy
prankster
this
time
it
the
real
thing
the
thunder
of
hoofbeats
had
not
gone
unheard
by
those
within
the
walls
of
sleepy
hollow
lights
flashed
on
in
the
house
two
men
with
lanterns
came
running
from
the
mill
shack
get
him
get
him
screamed
a
woman
voice
from
an
upstairs
window
of
the
house
the
clamor
did
not
seem
to
disturb
the
goblin
rider
at
unchanged
pace
he
clattered
across
the
bridge
to
its
far
side
as
the
two
men
ran
toward
him
he
suddenly
swerved
plunging
his
horse
across
a
ditch
and
up
a
steep
bank
there
he
drew
rein
for
an
instant
rising
in
his
stirrups
he
hurled
a
small
hard
object
at
the
two
guards
it
missed
them
by
inches
and
fell
with
a
thud
on
the
bridge
then
with
a
laugh
that
resembled
no
earthly
sound
the
headless
horseman
rode
through
a
gap
in
the
bushes
and
was
gone
louise
and
penny
ran
to
the
bridge
half
way
across
they
found
the
object
that
had
been
hurled
it
was
a
small
round
stone
to
which
had
been
fastened
a
piece
of
paper
penny
picked
up
the
missile
before
she
could
examine
it
burmaster
came
running
from
the
house
he
had
not
taken
time
to
dress
but
had
thrown
a
bathrobe
over
his
pajamas
you
let
that
fellow
get
away
again
he
shouted
angrily
to
the
two
workmen
ca
you
ever
stay
on
the
job
see
here
burmaster
one
of
the
men
replied
we
work
eight
hours
a
day
and
then
do
guard
duty
at
night
you
ca
expect
us
to
stay
awake
hours
a
day
all
right
all
right
burmaster
retorted
irritably
turning
toward
the
bridge
he
saw
louise
and
penny
well
so
you
here
again
he
observed
though
not
in
an
unfriendly
tone
penny
explained
that
she
and
louise
had
attended
the
barn
dance
and
were
on
their
way
to
the
lear
cabin
what
that
you
have
in
your
hand
he
interrupted
a
stone
that
the
headless
horseman
threw
at
your
workmen
there
a
paper
tied
to
it
let
have
it
burmaster
commanded
penny
handed
over
the
stone
though
she
would
have
preferred
to
have
examined
it
herself
burmaster
cut
the
string
which
kept
the
paper
in
place
he
held
it
beneath
one
of
the
lanterns
large
capital
letters
cut
from
newspaper
headlines
had
been
pasted
in
an
uneven
row
across
the
page
the
words
spelled
a
message
which
read
kick
in
handsomely
on
the
huntley
dam
fund
if
you
oblige
the
galloping
ghost
will
bother
you
no
more
burmaster
read
the
message
aloud
and
crumpling
the
paper
stuffed
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
robe
there
you
see
he
cried
angrily
it
all
a
plot
to
force
me
to
put
up
money
for
the
huntley
dam
who
do
you
think
the
prankster
is
penny
asked
how
should
i
know
burmaster
stormed
the
townspeople
of
delta
may
be
behind
the
scheme
or
those
hill
rats
like
silas
malcom
then
it
could
be
old
lady
lear
can
she
ride
a
horse
louise
interposed
can
that
old
witch
ride
burmaster
snorted
she
was
born
in
a
saddle
has
one
of
the
best
horses
in
the
valley
too
a
jumper
penny
and
louise
thought
of
trinidad
with
new
respect
not
without
misgiving
they
recalled
that
lear
had
slipped
away
from
the
barn
dance
ahead
of
them
wisely
they
kept
the
knowledge
to
themselves
i
give
a
thousand
dollars
for
the
capture
of
that
rascal
burmaster
went
on
and
if
it
proves
to
be
lear
i
add
another
five
hundred
why
not
be
rid
of
the
ghost
in
an
easier
way
penny
suggested
give
the
money
to
the
huntley
dam
fund
never
i
not
be
blackmailed
besides
the
rains
are
letting
up
there
no
danger
penny
and
louise
did
not
attempt
to
argue
the
matter
the
huntley
dam
feud
was
none
of
their
concern
by
the
following
day
they
expected
to
be
far
from
the
valley
there
another
person
who
might
be
behind
this
burmaster
continued
a
newspaper
editor
at
hobostein
he
always
hated
me
and
been
using
his
paper
to
write
ugly
editorials
i
ought
to
sue
him
for
slander
though
the
headless
horseman
episode
had
excited
the
girls
they
were
tired
and
eager
to
get
to
lear
accordingly
they
cut
the
conversation
short
and
started
on
down
the
road
burmaster
fell
into
step
walking
with
them
as
far
as
the
house
come
to
see
us
sometime
he
invited
with
a
cordiality
that
astonished
the
girls
burmaster
gets
very
lonesome
she
nervous
but
she
means
well
i
sure
she
does
penny
responded
kindly
she
hesitated
then
added
i
do
hope
you
catch
the
prankster
have
you
considered
putting
a
barricade
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
ca
do
it
when
we
built
this
place
we
had
to
agree
to
keep
the
footbridge
open
to
pedestrians
suppose
one
had
a
moveable
barrier
penny
suggested
could
your
workmen
keep
watch
and
swing
it
into
place
after
the
horseman
started
across
the
bridge
with
one
at
each
end
he
be
trapped
it
an
idea
to
be
considered
burmaster
admitted
the
only
trouble
is
that
my
workmen
are
worth
their
salt
as
guards
but
see
penny
and
louise
soon
bade
the
estate
owner
goodnight
and
went
on
down
the
road
once
beyond
hearing
they
discussed
the
possibility
that
lear
might
have
masqueraded
as
the
headless
horseman
it
was
queer
the
way
she
disappeared
from
the
dance
penny
speculated
granting
that
she
a
spry
old
lady
i
doubt
she
have
it
in
her
to
pull
off
the
trick
i
not
so
sure
louise
argued
burmaster
said
she
was
a
wonderful
rider
did
you
think
that
horse
tonight
looked
like
trinidad
goodness
it
was
too
dark
to
see
in
any
case
what
about
the
buggy
lear
could
have
unhitched
it
somewhere
in
the
woods
penny
shook
her
head
it
does
add
up
somehow
for
that
matter
nothing
about
this
affair
does
rounding
a
curve
the
girls
came
within
view
of
the
lear
cabin
no
light
burned
but
they
took
it
for
granted
lear
had
gone
to
bed
let
give
a
in
the
barn
penny
proposed
i
want
to
make
sure
that
our
horses
are
all
right
and
to
see
that
the
buggy
is
there
too
laughed
louise
they
went
past
the
dripping
water
trough
to
the
barn
and
opened
the
doors
white
foot
nickered
bones
kicked
at
the
stall
boards
penny
tossed
both
horses
a
few
ears
of
corn
and
then
walked
on
to
stall
it
was
empty
nor
was
there
any
evidence
of
a
buggy
well
what
do
you
think
of
that
penny
commented
lear
not
been
home
then
maybe
burmaster
theory
is
right
louise
exclaimed
staring
at
the
empty
stall
lear
could
have
been
the
one
listen
commanded
penny
plainly
the
girls
could
hear
a
horse
and
vehicle
coming
down
the
road
it
was
lear
and
a
moment
later
she
turned
into
the
yard
penny
swung
open
the
barn
doors
trinidad
rattled
in
and
pulled
up
short
his
sleek
body
was
covered
with
sweat
as
if
he
had
been
driven
hard
lear
leaped
lightly
to
the
barn
floor
and
began
to
unhitch
the
horse
well
i
mighty
glad
to
find
you
here
she
chirped
joe
brought
you
home
did
he
penny
replied
that
she
and
louise
had
walked
you
do
say
the
old
woman
exclaimed
i
went
down
the
road
a
piece
to
see
a
friend
o
mine
by
the
time
i
got
back
the
frolic
was
over
i
calculated
joe
must
have
brought
you
home
penny
and
louise
offered
little
comment
as
they
helped
lear
unhitch
trinidad
however
they
could
see
that
the
old
lady
was
fairly
with
suppressed
excitement
it
late
but
i
ai
one
bit
tired
lear
declared
as
they
all
entered
the
house
there
somethin
mighty
stimulatin
about
a
barn
dance
penny
was
tempted
to
remark
that
her
hostess
had
spent
very
little
time
at
silas
malcom
place
instead
she
remained
silent
the
girls
went
at
once
to
bed
lear
did
not
follow
them
upstairs
immediately
but
puttered
about
the
kitchen
preparing
herself
a
midnight
snack
finally
her
step
was
heard
on
the
stairs
good
night
girls
she
called
cheerfully
as
she
passed
their
door
sleep
tight
lear
entered
her
own
bedroom
her
door
squeaked
shut
a
shoe
was
heard
to
thud
on
the
floor
then
another
i
wish
i
knew
what
to
think
penny
confided
to
louise
in
a
whisper
she
the
queerest
old
lady
louise
had
no
opportunity
to
reply
for
both
girls
were
startled
to
hear
a
shrill
cry
from
the
far
end
of
the
hall
the
next
instant
their
bedroom
door
burst
open
lear
grotesque
in
old
fashioned
flannel
nightgown
staggered
into
the
room
why
what
wrong
penny
asked
in
astonishment
i
been
robbed
lear
proclaimed
wildly
i
been
robbed
chapter
penny
leaped
out
of
bed
and
touched
a
match
to
the
wick
of
an
oil
lamp
in
its
flickering
yellow
glow
lear
looked
as
pale
as
a
ghost
while
we
were
at
the
barn
dance
someone
broke
into
the
house
the
old
lady
explained
in
an
agitated
voice

deed

be
put
off
my
land
like
the
others
oh
lawseeme
i
wisht
i
was

asked
perplexed
why

deed
to
this
house
and

land
i
always
kept
it
under
the
mattress
o
my
bed
now
it

i
always
calculated
on
havin

as
i
could
figured
to
have
the
property

son
name
jes
before
i

and

and

deed

lost
and
not
recorded
you

in
difficulties
penny
agreed
perhaps
it
is
lost
said
louise
encouragingly
did
you
search
everywhere
mrs
lear
i
pulled
the
bed
half
to
pieces
we
help
you
look
for
it
penny
offered
it
must
be
here
somewhere
this
is
the
fust
time
in
twenty
years
that
anyone
ever
stole
anything
off
me
the
old
lady
wailed
as
she
led
the
way
down
the
dark
hall
but
i
kinda
knowed
somethin
like
this
was
goin
to
happen
lear
bedroom
was
in
great
disorder
blankets
had
been
strewn
over
the
floor
and
the
limp
mattress
lay
doubled
up
on
the
springs
you
see
the
old
lady
cried
the
deed
gone
i
looked
everywhere
penny
and
louise
carefully
folded
all
the
blankets
they
straightened
the
mattress
and
searched
carefully
along
the
springs
they
looked
beneath
the
bed
the
missing
paper
was
not
to
be
found
are
you
sure
you
did
hide
it
somewhere
else
penny
asked
fer
ten
years
i
kept
that
deed
under
the
bed
mattress
the
old
lady
snapped
oh
it
been
stole
all
right
an
there
the
tracks
o
the
thievin
rascal
that
did
it
too
lear
lowered
the
oil
lamp
closer
to
the
floor
plainly
visible
were
the
muddy
heelprints
of
a
woman
shoe
the
marks
had
left
smudges
on
the
rag
rugs
which
dotted
the
room
they
crisscrossed
the
bare
floor
to
the
door
the
window
and
the
bed
penny
and
louise
followed
the
trail
down
the
hallway
to
the
stairs
they
picked
it
up
again
in
the
kitchen
and
there
lost
it
you
do
need
to
follow
them
tracks
no
further
lear
advised
grimly
i
know
who
it
was
that
stole
the
deed
there
ai
nobody
could
o
done
it
but
mrs
burmaster
mrs
burmaster
louise
echoed
rather
stunned
by
the
accusation
she
move
heaven
and
earth
to
git
me
off
this
here
bit
o
land
she
hates
me
and
i
hate
her
but
how
could
burmaster
know
you
had
the
deed
penny
asked
you
never
told
her
did
you
seems
to
me
like
onest
in
an
argument
i
did
say
somethin
about
having
it
here
in
the
house
lear
admitted
we
was
goin
it
hot
and
heavy
one
day
an
i
do
remember
jest
what
i
did
tell
her
too
much
i
reckon
the
old
lady
sat
down
heavily
in
a
chair
by
the
stove
she
looked
sick
and
beaten
do
take
it
so
hard
penny
advised
kindly
you
ca
be
sure
that
burmaster
stole
the
deed
who
else
would
want
it
some
other
person
might
have
done
it
for
spite
lear
shook
her
head
so
far
i
know
i
ai
got
another
enemy
in
the
whole
world
oh
burmaster
done
it
all
right
but
what
can
she
hope
to
gain
asked
penny
she
aims
to
put
me
off
this
land
burmaster
seems
like
a
fairly
reasonable
man
i
doubt
he
make
any
use
of
the
deed
even
if
his
wife
turned
it
over
to
him
maybe
not
lear
agreed
but
burmaster
ai
likely
to
give
it
to
her
husband
she
find
some
other
way
to
git
at
me
you
see
nothing
penny
or
louise
could
say
cheered
the
old
lady
do
you
worry
none
about
me
she
told
them
i
brew
a
cup
o
tea
and
take
some
aspirin
then
maybe
i
kin
think
up
a
way
to
git
that
deed
back
i
ai
through
yet
not
by
a
long
shot
long
after
penny
and
louise
had
gone
back
to
bed
the
old
lady
remained
in
the
kitchen
it
was
nearly
three
before
they
heard
her
tiptoe
upstairs
to
her
room
but
at
seven
the
next
morning
she
was
abroad
as
usual
and
had
breakfast
waiting
for
them
i
thought
things
through
she
told
penny
as
she
poured
coffee
from
a
blackened
pot
it
wo
do
no
good
to
go
to
burmaster
and
try
to
make
her
give
up
that
deed
i
jes
wait
and
see
what
she
does
fust
and
in
the
meantime
the
deed
may
show
up
penny
replied
even
though
you
think
burmaster
took
it
there
always
a
chance
that
it
was
only
misplaced
foot
tracks
do
lie
the
old
lady
retorted
i
was
out
lookin
around
early
this
morning
them
prints
lead
from
my
door
straight
toward
the
burmasters
deeply
as
were
the
girls
interested
in
lear
problem
they
knew
that
they
could
be
of
no
help
to
her
already
they
had
lingered
in
red
valley
far
longer
than
their
original
plan
they
shuddered
to
think
what
their
parents
would
say
if
and
when
they
returned
to
riverview
lou
we
have
to
start
for
hobostein
right
away
penny
announced
be
lucky
if
we
get
there
in
time
to
catch
a
train
home
lear
urged
her
young
guests
to
remain
another
day
but
to
her
kind
invitation
they
turned
deaf
ears
in
vain
they
pressed
money
upon
her
she
refused
to
accept
anything
so
penny
was
compelled
to
hide
a
bill
in
the
teapot
where
it
would
be
found
later
you
come
again
the
old
lady
asked
almost
plaintively
as
she
bade
them
goodbye
we
try
to
penny
promised
mounting
bones
but
if
we
do
it
will
be
by
train
i
got
a
feeling
i
ai
goin
to
be
here
much
longer
lear
said
sadly
do
worry
about
the
deed
penny
tried
to
cheer
her
even
if
burmaster
should
have
it
she
may
be
afraid
to
try
to
make
trouble
for
you
it
ai
just
that
biddy
i
worried
about
it
somethin
deeper
lear
clear
gaze
swept
toward
the
hills
penny
and
louise
waited
for
her
to
go
on
after
a
moment
she
did
seen
a
rain
crow
a
settin
on
the
fence
this
morning
there
be
rain
an
a
lot
of
it
maybe
the
dam
will
hold
an
again
maybe
it
wo
should
you
move
to
the
hills
penny
asked
anxiously
lear
answer
was
a
tight
smile
hard
as
granite
nothin
on
earth
kin
move
me
off
this
land
nothin
if
the
flood
takes
my
house
it
take
me
with
it
the
old
lady
extended
a
bony
hand
and
gravely
bade
each
of
the
girls
goodbye
penny
and
louise
rode
their
horses
to
the
curve
of
the
road
and
then
looked
back
lear
stood
by
the
gate
for
all
the
world
like
a
statue
of
bronze
they
waved
a
fast
farewell
but
she
did
not
appear
to
see
her
eyes
were
raised
to
the
misty
hills
and
she
stood
thus
until
the
trees
blotted
her
from
view
chapter
somehow
i
ca
get
old
lear
out
of
my
mind
lou
i
keep
wondering
what
happened
at
red
valley
after
we
left
penny
sprawled
on
the
davenport
of
the
parker
home
one
blue
wedge
draped
over
its
rolling
upholstered
arm
her
chum
louise
had
curled
herself
kitten
fashion
in
a
chair
across
the
room
a
full
week
now
had
elapsed
since
the
two
girls
had
returned
to
riverview
from
red
valley
during
that
time
it
had
rained
nearly
every
day
even
now
a
misty
drizzle
kept
the
girls
indoors
wonder
if
it
raining
at
red
valley
penny
mused
why
do
you
tear
that
place
out
of
your
mind
louise
demanded
a
bit
impatiently
we
tried
to
solve
the
mystery
and
we
could
so
forget
it
i
do
try
but
i
ca
penny
sighed
i
keep
telling
myself
lear
must
be
the
person
who
masquerades
as
the
headless
horseman
yet
i
completely
accept
such
a
theory
you
go
batty
if
you
keep
on
the
worst
of
it
is
that
everyone
laughs
at
me
penny
complained
if
i
so
much
as
mention
the
headless
horseman
dad
starts
to
crack
jokes
a
step
sounded
on
the
porch
speaking
of
your
father
here
he
comes
now
louise
observed
and
straightened
in
her
chair
penny
did
not
bother
to
undrape
herself
from
the
davenport
dad
she
greeted
her
father
as
he
came
in
are
you
home
early
for
lunch
i
am
about
half
an
hour
ahead
of
schedule
parker
agreed
he
spoke
to
louise
as
he
casually
dropped
an
edition
of
the
into
his
daughter
hands
that
town
of
yours
has
smashed
into
print
penny
what
town
penny
feet
came
down
from
the
arm
of
the
davenport
and
she
seized
the
paper
not
red
valley
red
valley
is
very
much
in
the
news
parker
replied
these
rains
are
weakening
the
dam
and
some
of
the
experts
are
becoming
alarmed
they
are
sending
someone
up
to
look
it
over
oh
dad
i
tried
to
tell
you
penny
cried
excitedly
with
louise
peering
over
her
shoulder
she
spread
out
the
front
page
of
the
paper
and
read
the
story
oh
it
hardly
tells
a
thing
she
complained
after
she
had
scanned
it
so
far
there
not
been
much
to
report
parker
replied
but
if
the
dam
should
let
go
wow
would
that
be
a
story
i
sending
my
best
staff
photographer
there
to
get
pictures
penny
pricked
up
her
ears
salt
sommers
she
demanded
yes
the
ca
take
a
chance
on
being
scooped
by
another
paper
speaking
of
chances
lou
this
is
ours
penny
cried
why
do
we
go
to
red
valley
with
salt
now
just
a
minute
interrupted
parker
salt
going
there
on
business
and
he
have
no
time
for
any
you
be
a
bother
to
him
a
bother
to
salt
penny
protested
indignantly
why
the
very
idea
another
thing
parker
resumed
red
valley
is
considered
the
safest
place
in
the
world
just
now
while
it
unlikely
the
dam
will
give
way
still
the
possibility
exists
if
it
should
the
break
will
come
without
warning
and
there
apt
to
be
a
heavy
loss
of
life
but
not
mine
said
penny
with
great
confidence
do
forget
that
i
won
three
ribbons
and
a
medal
this
year
not
for
being
a
poor
swimmer
either
all
the
same
i
should
be
too
boastful
her
father
advised
dryly
when
is
salt
leaving
penny
demanded
any
time
now
but
i
sure
he
wo
let
you
tag
along
we
see
if
we
can
change
his
mind
penny
grinned
reaching
for
the
telephone
disregarding
her
father
frown
she
called
the
photographer
at
the
office
salt
was
leaving
for
red
valley
in
twenty
minutes
and
he
willingly
agreed
to
take
two
passengers
there
you
see
penny
cried
triumphantly
slamming
the
receiver
into
its
hook
i
do
like
the
idea
parker
grumbled
let
hear
what
weems
has
to
say
the
housekeeper
it
developed
had
a
great
deal
to
say
penny
however
was
equal
to
all
arguments
so
eloquently
did
she
plead
her
case
that
weems
weakened
you
wanted
an
old
spinning
wheel
for
months
penny
reminded
her
while
i
at
red
valley
i
get
one
for
you
it
seems
to
me
i
heard
that
argument
before
weems
said
dryly
i
did
get
a
chance
to
see
about
it
when
i
was
there
last
time
penny
hastened
on
this
time
i
make
it
a
point
i
promise
i
pretty
sure

the
one
silas
malcom
has
if
you
must
go
please
do
distract
salt
with
spinning
wheels
parker
said
crossly
or
headless
horseman
rot
remember
he
has
a
job
to
do
lou
and
i
will
help
him
penny
laughed
just
wait
and
see
in
the
end
parker
and
weems
reluctantly
said
that
penny
might
go
louise
obtained
permission
from
her
mother
to
make
the
trip
and
fifteen
minutes
later
the
girls
were
at
the
office
as
they
entered
the
wire
photo
room
a
loudspeaker
blared
forth
all
right
riverview
go
ahead
with
your
fire
picture
goodness
what
was
that
louise
exclaimed
startled
only
the
wire
photo
dispatcher
talking
over
the
loudspeaker
from
new
york
penny
chuckled
we
about
to
send
a
picture
out
over
the
network
but
how
watch
and
see
penny
advised
in
the
center
of
the
room
stood
two
machines
with
cylinders
one
for
transmitting
pictures
to
distant
stations
the
other
for
receiving
them
on
the
sending
cylinder
was
wrapped
a
glossy
by
photograph
of
a
fire
as
penny
spoke
an
attendant
pressed
a
starter
switch
on
the
sending
machine
there
was
a
high
pitched
rasp
as
the
clutch
threw
in
and
the
cylinder
bearing
the
picture
began
to
turn
at
a
steady
measured
pace
it
a
complicated
process
penny
said
glibly
a
photo
electric
cell
scans
the
picture
and
transmits
it
to
all
the
points
on
the
network
salt
here
could
tell
you
more
about
it
too
busy
just
now
grinned
the
young
photographer
he
stood
beside
a
cabinet
stuffing
flashbulbs
into
his
coat
pocket
it
time
traveling
salt
grinned
in
a
harassed
but
friendly
way
at
the
girls
he
was
tall
and
freckled
and
not
very
good
looking
nevertheless
he
was
the
best
photographer
on
the
i
afraid
we
took
advantage
of
you
in
asking
for
a
ride
to
red
valley
penny
apologized
tickled
to
have
you
ride
along
salt
cut
in
he
picked
up
his
speed
graphic
camera
and
slung
a
supply
case
over
his
shoulder
well
shove
off
for
the
wet
country
the
ride
by
press
car
to
delta
was
far
from
pleasant
salt
drove
too
fast
the
road
was
slippery
once
the
auto
left
the
pavement
and
ditches
brimmed
with
brown
muddy
water
at
one
point
they
were
forced
to
detour
five
miles
to
avoid
a
bridge
that
had
washed
out
instead
of
reaching
delta
early
in
the
day
as
they
had
planned
it
was
well
into
the
afternoon
before
they
arrived
where
shall
i
drop
you
girls
salt
inquired
wearily
i
have
to
work
fast
if
i
get
any
pictures
this
afternoon
drop
us
anywhere
penny
said
we
spend
the
night
with
lear
and
go
home
by
train
tomorrow
wonder
which
way
it
is
to
the
huntley
dam
we
show
you
the
road
penny
offered
it
directly
on
your
way
to
let
us
off
at
the
malcom
place
i
want
to
stop
there
to
see
about
a
spinning
wheel
guided
by
the
two
girls
salt
drove
up
the
winding
hillside
road
to
silas
malcom
little
farm
there
penny
and
louise
said
goodbye
to
him
and
sought
to
renew
acquaintances
with
the
elderly
hillman
the
old
man
got
up
from
a
porch
rocker
to
greet
them
cordially
well
well
i
knowed
you
come
back
one
o
these
days
he
chuckled
thank
ye
mightily
fer
puttin
them
about
red
valley
in
the
paper
i
afraid
i
did
have
much
to
do
with
it
penny
said
modestly
red
valley
really
is
a
news
center
these
days
we
sittin
on
a
stick
o
dynamite
here
the
old
man
agreed
worried
about
lear
me
and
the
wife
want
her
to
move
up
here
on
the
hill
where
she
be
safe
but
not
that
ole
gal
she
as
stubborn
as
a
mule
and
what
of
the
burmasters
i
ai
worryin
none
about
them
they
kin
look
after
themselves
they
so
cock
sure
there
ai
no
danger
then
you
feel
the
situation
really
is
serious
old
silas
spat
into
the
grass
when
that
dam
lets
go
he
said
there
ai
goin
to
be
no
written
notice
sent
ahead
the
burmaster
place
will
be
taken
and
then
lear
after
that
the
water
sweep
down
on
delta
an
express
train
from
there
it
spread
out
over
the
whole
valley
but
why
do
people
move
to
safety
down
at
delta
plenty
of
are
pullin
up
stakes
old
silas
admitted
the
burmasters
are
sittin
tight
though
and
so
is
mrs
lear
we
were
planning
on
staying
with
her
tonight
louise
contributed
uneasily
reckon
you
be
safe
enough
old
silas
assured
her
water
level
been
risin
none
in
the
last
ten
hours
but
if
we
have
another
rain
above
us
look
out
after
chatting
a
bit
longer
penny
broached
the
matter
of
the
spinning
wheel
to
her
delight
malcom
not
only
offered
to
sell
it
for
a
small
sum
but
he
volunteered
to
haul
it
to
the
railroad
station
for
shipment
the
slow
tedious
wagon
ride
down
to
delta
gave
the
girls
added
opportunity
to
seek
information
from
the
old
man
penny
deliberately
spoke
of
the
headless
horseman
had
the
mysterious
rider
been
seen
or
heard
of
in
the
valley
in
recent
days
you
ca
prove
it
by
me
the
old
man
chuckled
i
been
so
busy
in
my
crops
i
ai
had
no
time
fer
such
goins
on
arriving
at
delta
malcom
drove
directly
to
the
railroad
station
joe
quigley
ought
to
be
around
here
somewhere
he
remarked
see
if
you
can
run
him
down
while
i
unload
this
spinnin
wheel
penny
and
louise
entered
the
deserted
waiting
room
of
the
depot
the
door
of
the
little
station
office
was
closed
and
at
first
glance
they
thought
no
one
was
there
then
they
saw
joe
quigley
standing
with
his
back
toward
them
he
was
engrossed
in
examining
something
on
the
floor
an
object
that
was
below
their
field
of
vision
hello
mr
quigley
penny
sang
out
the
station
agent
straightened
so
suddenly
that
he
bumped
his
head
against
the
ticket
counter
he
stared
at
the
girls
then
as
they
moved
toward
the
little
window
he
hastily
gathered
up
whatever
he
had
been
examining
as
if
fearful
that
they
would
see
the
object
he
crammed
it
into
an
open
office
closet
and
slammed
the
door
chapter
moving
well
well
joe
quigley
greeted
the
girls
cordially
it
good
to
see
you
again
when
did
you
blow
into
town
louise
and
penny
came
close
to
the
ticket
window
they
were
curious
as
to
what
the
young
station
agent
had
hidden
in
the
closet
however
they
did
not
disclose
by
look
or
action
that
they
suspected
anything
was
wrong
we
drove
in
about
an
hour
ago
penny
replied
carelessly
we
want
to
ship
a
spinning
wheel
by
freight
to
riverview
i
advise
you
to
send
it
by
express
quigley
said
briskly
that
way
you
have
it
delivered
to
your
door
and
the
difference
will
be
trifling
any
way
you
say
penny
agreed
joe
went
outside
with
the
girls
silas
already
had
unloaded
the
spinning
wheel
he
turned
it
over
to
the
station
agent
and
after
a
bit
of
goodnatured
joshing
drove
away
i
can
get
this
out
for
you
on
no
joe
promised
the
girls
come
on
back
to
the
office
while
i
bill
it
out
penny
and
louise
followed
the
station
agent
into
the
little
ticket
room
their
ears
were
assailed
by
the
chatter
of
several
telegraph
instruments
mounted
around
the
edge
of
a
circular
work
desk
how
many
wires
come
in
here
penny
asked
curiously
three
the
dispatcher
wire
western
union
and
the
message
wire
penny
listened
attentively
to
the
staccato
chatter
of
one
of
the
wires
she
said
aloud
would
that
be
the
delta
station
call
it
is
quigley
agreed
giving
her
a
quick
look
of
surprise
he
sat
down
at
the
circular
desk
and
reached
for
the
telegraph
key
after
tapping
out
a
swift
brief
message
he
closed
the
circuit
get
that
he
grinned
at
penny
she
shook
her
head
ruefully
i
learned
the
morse
code
and
that
about
all
she
confessed
i
used
to
practice
on
a
homemade
outfit
dad
fixed
up
for
me
quite
a
gal
quigley
said
admiringly
what
ca
you
do
this
was
penny
opportunity
and
she
seized
it
quite
a
number
of
things
she
answered
for
one
i
ca
solve
a
certain
mystery
that
plagues
me
joe
quigley
finished
making
out
the
way
bill
his
eyes
danced
as
he
handed
penny
her
receipt
so
you
admit
that
you
met
your
waterloo
in
our
galloping
ghost
i
admit
nothing
penny
retorted
you
could
help
me
if
you
would
how
i
sure
you
know
the
person
who
has
been
causing
the
burmasters
so
much
trouble
trouble
quigley
eyebrows
jerked
the
way
i
look
at
it
that
headless
horseman
may
do
a
good
turn
he
may
actually
save
their
worthless
necks
by
driving
them
out
of
the
valley
meaning
meaning
that
burmaster
ca
keep
on
in
his
bull
headed
fashion
without
bringing
tragedy
upon
himself
as
well
as
the
valley
even
now
probably
too
late
to
reinforce
the
dam
then
what
does
your
prankster
hope
to
gain
you
have
to
ask
him
joe
quigley
shrugged
this
is
the
way
i
look
at
it
lear
and
the
burmasters
are
deep
in
a
feud
the
old
lady
lost
the
deed
to
her
place
and
she
figures
if
she
moves
off
the
burmasters
somehow
will
take
advantage
of
her
they
made
no
attempt
to
do
so
not
yet
but
old
lear
is
convinced
burmaster
is
biding
her
time
it
all
sounds
rather
silly
maybe
it
does
to
an
outsider
but
this
is
the
serious
part
if
the
dam
should
let
go
there
be
no
chance
to
warn
either
the
burmasters
or
lear
both
places
should
be
evacuated
then
why
is
it
done
because
two
stubborn
women
refuse
to
listen
to
reason
burmaster
wo
budge
because
she
says
there
no
danger
that
it
a
scheme
to
get
her
out
of
the
valley
lear
wo
leave
her
home
while
the
burmasters
stay
what
to
be
done
ask
me
something
easy
the
telegraph
instrument
was
chattering
the
delta
station
call
again
so
quigley
turned
to
answer
it
if
you
see
lear
before
you
leave
here
try
to
reason
with
her
he
tossed
over
his
shoulder
i
given
up
the
girls
nodded
goodbye
and
went
outside
silas
malcom
wagon
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
after
a
brief
debate
they
decided
to
walk
to
lear
place
maybe
we
still
can
catch
a
ride
home
with
salt
louise
remarked
dubiously
with
all
this
talk
about
the
dam
i
certainly
do
relish
spending
a
night
in
the
valley
oh
silas
said
there
was
no
immediate
danger
unless
it
rains
again
penny
reminded
her
chum
what
joe
quigley
said
about
lear
worries
me
we
must
try
to
get
her
to
leave
the
valley
why
not
move
a
mountain
louise
countered
it
would
be
a
lot
easier
when
the
girls
reached
lear
cabin
they
discovered
that
word
of
their
arrival
in
delta
had
traveled
ahead
of
them
your
room
all
ready
fer
you
the
old
lady
beamed
as
she
greeted
them
at
the
door
this
time
i
hope
you
stayin
fer
a
week
nothing
seemed
changed
at
the
lear
cabin
lear
had
spent
the
morning
canning
fruit
and
the
kitchen
table
was
loaded
with
containers
a
washing
flapped
lazily
on
the
line
while
waiting
for
the
clothes
to
dry
the
old
lady
filled
in
her
time
by
sewing
on
a
rag
rug
of
elaborate
pattern
i
a
mite
behind
in
my
work
she
confessed
to
her
young
visitors
these
infernal
rains
set
a
body
back
fer
three
days
i
could
get
my
washin
hung
an
i
never
will
git
my
corn
dried
less
i
do
it
in
the
oven
speaking
of
rain
penny
began
hesitantly
do
you
think
dangerous
to
remain
here
much
longer
maybe
it
is
maybe
it
ai
the
old
lady
retorted
either
way
i
not
worryin
there
ai
nothin
going
to
put
me
off
my
place
not
even
a
flood
joe
quigley
thinks
that
you
and
the
burmasters
both
should
move
to
a
safer
place
then
let
go
fust
lear
declared
did
burmaster
steal
the
deed
to
my
land
jest
fer
meanness
and
spite
if
i
was
dumb
enough
to
leave
this
place
fer
an
hour
she
find
some
way
to
git
it
away
from
me
that
could
be
done
so
easily
smiled
penny
after
all
burmaster
has
more
sense
than
his
wife
did
you
never
talk
to
him
about
the
missing
deed
we
had
words
lear
said
with
emphasis
he
stood
up
fer
his
wife
said
she
never
do
such
a
thing
but
i
know
better
yet
since
the
deed
disappeared
no
one
has
tried
to
put
you
off
your
land
that
cause
the
burmasters
are
waitin
their
chance
oh
they
sly
and
cunning
but
i
jest
as
smart
as
they
are
and
they
never
git
me
off
this
place
the
discussion
penny
felt
was
traveling
in
the
same
familiar
circle
one
could
not
influence
lear
her
mind
had
been
made
up
nothing
would
move
her
thinking
that
they
might
at
least
talk
matters
over
with
burmaster
the
girls
presently
walked
down
the
road
to
sleepy
hollow
estate
a
workman
who
was
busy
with
hammer
and
saw
told
them
that
and
burmaster
had
motored
to
delta
for
the
afternoon
what
are
you
building
penny
inquired
curiously
a
gate
you
might
call
it
that
he
grinned
burmaster
ordered
me
to
knock
together
a
couple
of
one
for
each
end
of
the
bridge
oh
i
see
light
dawned
upon
penny
moveable
barriers
to
trap
the
headless
horseman
prankster
it
a
lot
o
nonsense
if
you
ask
me
the
workman
grumbled
that
fellow
ai
been
around
here
in
a
week
reckon
he
may
never
show
up
again
yet
burmaster
keeps
watch
of
the
bridge
every
night
that
wife
of
his
would
give
him
no
peace
if
he
did
the
workman
hammered
a
nail
into
place
and
added
the
burmasters
have
got
something
to
worry
about
if
they
only
had
sense
enough
to
realize
it
you
mean
the
huntley
dam
the
workman
nodded
i
quittin
here
tonight
he
confessed
maybe
that
dam
will
hold
but
i
takin
no
chances
penny
and
louise
were
even
more
troubled
as
they
walked
back
to
lear
home
a
fine
supper
awaited
them
they
scarcely
did
justice
to
it
and
found
it
difficult
to
respond
to
the
old
lady
cheerful
conversation
she
just
does
seem
to
realize
that
she
in
any
danger
louise
whispered
despairingly
to
her
chum
as
they
did
the
dishes
together
oh
she
knows
penny
replied
but
lear
is
set
in
her
ways
i
doubt
anyone
can
induce
her
to
take
to
the
hills
after
the
dishes
had
been
put
away
the
girls
played
card
games
with
the
old
lady
promptly
at
nine
lear
announced
that
it
was
bed
time
as
she
locked
up
the
doors
for
the
night
she
stood
for
a
time
on
the
back
porch
staring
thoughtfully
at
the
clouds
it
looks
like
rain
again
penny
remarked
lear
said
nothing
she
closed
the
door
firmly
and
turned
the
key
once
in
their
bedroom
the
girls
undressed
quickly
and
blew
out
the
light
for
awhile
they
could
hear
lear
moving
about
on
the
bare
floor
of
her
own
room
then
the
house
became
quiet
i
be
glad
when
we
home
again
louise
whispered
snuggling
down
under
the
quilts
think
how
wet
we
get
if
that
dam
should
break
tonight
stop
talking
about
it
or
you
give
me
nightmares
penny
chided
let
go
to
sleep
try
as
they
would
the
girls
could
not
settle
down
first
penny
would
twist
and
turn
and
then
louise
would
do
her
share
of
squirming
finally
just
as
they
were
beginning
to
feel
drowsy
they
were
startled
to
hear
a
drumming
sound
on
the
tin
roof
above
their
heads
what
was
that
louise
muttered
sitting
up
the
sounds
were
coming
faster
and
faster
now
rain
penny
exclaimed
jumping
out
of
bed
she
went
to
the
window
already
the
panes
were
splashed
and
rivulets
were
chasing
one
another
to
the
sill
if
this
is
the
worst
luck
yet
she
muttered
it
looks
like
a
hard
rain
too
louise
joined
her
chum
at
the
window
disheartened
they
gazed
toward
the
woods
and
the
hills
ominous
warnings
arose
in
their
minds
to
plague
them
with
an
added
burden
of
water
could
the
dam
hold
sleep
seemed
out
of
the
question
wrapping
blankets
about
them
the
girls
drew
chairs
to
the
window
and
watched
then
as
suddenly
as
the
rain
had
started
it
ceased
a
moon
struggled
through
a
jagged
gap
of
the
clouds
the
woods
and
the
barn
became
discernible
once
more
rain
over
louise
said
covering
a
yawn
let
go
to
bed
penny
penny
gathered
up
the
quilts
from
the
floor
but
as
she
turned
away
from
the
window
an
object
outside
the
house
captured
her
attention
for
an
instant
she
thought
that
she
was
mistaken
then
she
gripped
hand
pulling
her
back
to
the
sill
what
is
it
louise
asked
in
bewilderment
look
over
there
penny
commanded
from
the
woods
across
the
road
the
girls
could
see
a
moving
light
someone
with
a
lantern
louise
said
indifferently
watch
penny
commanded
again
even
as
she
spoke
the
lantern
was
waved
in
a
half
circle
from
side
to
side
the
strange
movement
was
repeated
several
times
what
do
you
make
of
it
louise
whispered
in
awe
i
suspect
someone
is
trying
to
signal
this
house
penny
replied
soberly
let
keep
quiet
and
see
what
we
can
learn
chapter
the
for
several
minutes
nothing
very
spectacular
happened
at
intervals
the
strange
lantern
signals
were
repeated
it
looks
to
me
as
if
that
person
over
in
the
woods
is
trying
to
signal
someone
here
penny
said
peering
from
behind
the
window
curtain
mrs
lear
asked
louise
who
else
certainly
no
one
would
have
reason
to
try
to
attract
our
attention
but
why
should
anyone
come
here
tonight
as
the
girls
speculated
upon
the
meaning
of
the
mysterious
signals
they
heard
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
softly
open
footsteps
padded
noiselessly
past
their
door
are
you
asleep
girls
lear
voice
chirped
louise
would
have
answered
had
not
penny
clapped
a
hand
firmly
over
her
mouth
after
a
moment
the
footsteps
pattered
on
down
the
stairway
where
can
lear
be
going
penny
speculated
in
a
whisper
she
wanted
to
make
certain
that
we
were
asleep
the
girls
did
not
have
long
to
wait
soon
they
heard
an
outside
door
close
a
moment
later
they
saw
the
spry
old
lady
crossing
the
yard
to
the
barn
she
was
fully
dressed
and
wore
a
grotesque
jacket
as
protection
against
the
biting
night
wind
penny
turned
her
gaze
toward
the
woods
once
more
the
lantern
signals
had
ceased
what
do
you
think
is
going
on
louise
asked
in
bewilderment
penny
reached
for
her
clothing
which
had
been
left
in
an
untidy
heap
on
the
floor
i
do
know
she
replied
grimly
with
luck
we
find
out
they
dressed
as
quickly
as
they
could
as
penny
was
pulling
on
her
shoes
she
heard
the
barn
door
close
she
rushed
to
the
window
old
lady
lear
riding
with
an
easy
grace
that
belied
her
years
was
walking
trinidad
toward
the
road
now
where
she
going
penny
demanded
seizing
louise
by
the
hand
come
on
or
we
never
learn
clattering
down
the
stairs
they
reached
the
yard
in
time
to
see
lear
riding
into
the
woods
know
what
i
think
louise
asked
breathlessly
she
the
one
who
been
pulling
off
these
headless
horseman
stunts
someone
signaled
to
her
from
the
woods
penny
reminded
her
chum
starting
off
to
meet
whoever
flashed
the
lantern
to
attempt
to
follow
the
old
lady
afoot
seemed
a
foolish
thing
to
do
nevertheless
penny
was
convinced
that
lear
would
not
ride
far
into
the
woods
she
argued
that
a
golden
opportunity
would
be
lost
forever
if
they
did
not
try
to
learn
where
she
went
then
come
on
if
we
must
do
it
louise
consented
it
wo
be
easy
to
keep
her
in
sight
though
in
their
haste
the
girls
had
provided
themselves
with
no
light
nor
had
they
imagined
that
a
night
could
be
so
dark
once
among
the
trees
they
had
difficulty
in
keeping
to
the
trail
that
old
lear
had
chosen
let
turn
back
louise
pleaded
we
apt
to
get
lost
penny
however
was
stubbornly
determined
to
learn
the
old
destination
though
she
could
not
see
trinidad
she
could
hear
the
crashing
of
underbrush
only
a
short
distance
ahead
penny
i
ca
keep
on
louise
gasped
a
moment
later
i
winded
you
scared
penny
amended
well
so
am
i
but
it
just
as
easy
to
go
on
now
as
it
is
to
turn
back
the
trail
lear
had
taken
led
at
a
steep
angle
uphill
the
old
lady
allowed
her
horse
to
take
his
time
even
so
the
girls
were
hard
pressed
to
keep
fairly
close
listen
penny
presently
commanded
in
a
whisper
no
longer
could
they
hear
the
sound
of
trinidad
hoofbeats
we
lost
her
louise
said
anxiously
i
think
lear
has
stopped
penny
replied
keeping
her
voice
low
perhaps
she
heard
us
and
suspects
that
we
followed
her
more
cautiously
than
before
the
girls
moved
forward
it
was
well
that
they
did
for
unexpectedly
they
came
to
a
brook
and
a
clearing
lear
had
dismounted
and
tied
trinidad
to
an
elm
tree
close
to
the
edge
huddling
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
the
girls
waited
and
watched
lear
did
not
appear
to
be
expecting
anyone
she
gave
trinidad
a
friendly
pat
then
making
certain
that
he
was
securely
fastened
to
the
tree
walked
briskly
toward
the
girls
penny
and
louise
cringed
closer
to
the
ground
the
old
lady
passed
them
and
went
on
down
the
trail
you
stay
here
and
keep
watch
of
trinidad
penny
instructed
follow
mrs
lear
louise
did
not
want
to
remain
alone
she
started
to
say
so
but
penny
was
gone
the
moment
her
chum
had
vanished
from
sight
sheer
panic
took
possession
of
louise
an
owl
hooted
the
cry
sent
icy
chills
racing
down
the
spine
tensely
she
listened
she
was
certain
she
could
hear
footsteps
approaching
the
brook
suddenly
she
lost
all
interest
in
solving
the
mystery
her
one
desire
was
to
get
safely
out
of
the
woods
shamelessly
she
turned
and
fled
penny
doggedly
following
lear
was
startled
to
hear
a
crashing
of
the
bushes
behind
her
as
she
paused
louise
came
running
up
what
is
it
penny
demanded
did
someone
come
for
trinidad
i
do
know
and
i
do
care
louise
answered
grimly
call
me
a
coward
if
you
like
i
not
stay
by
myself
penny
did
not
chide
her
chum
though
she
was
disappointed
a
thought
convinced
her
that
since
louise
was
unwilling
to
remain
by
the
brook
it
now
would
be
better
for
them
both
to
trail
lear
if
they
were
not
to
lose
her
they
must
hasten
along
where
do
you
think
the
old
lady
is
going
louise
presently
asked
as
they
stumbled
over
a
trail
not
back
home
no
penny
agreed
in
a
whisper
we
going
in
the
wrong
direction
for
that
unexpectedly
the
girls
emerged
into
a
clearing
not
daring
to
cross
the
open
space
lest
lear
see
them
they
huddled
at
the
fringe
of
trees
overhead
dark
clouds
scudded
and
boiled
a
strengthening
wind
whipped
their
clothing
about
them
lear
moved
spryly
across
the
open
space
pausing
near
the
edge
of
a
cliff
she
crouched
beside
a
huge
boulder
grasping
a
bush
for
support
she
peered
down
into
the
valley
we
may
be
directly
above
sleepy
hollow
estate
penny
whispered
excitedly
let
try
to
get
closer
and
see
treading
cautiously
over
the
sodden
leaves
the
girls
made
a
wide
circle
along
the
edge
of
trees
keeping
a
safe
distance
from
lear
they
peered
down
over
the
rim
of
the
valley
as
penny
had
guessed
sleepy
hollow
was
to
be
seen
below
a
light
dimly
visible
burned
on
the
lower
floor
of
the
dwelling
they
barely
were
able
to
discern
the
long
narrow
bridge
spanning
the
mill
pond
now
why
do
you
suppose
lear
came
here
at
this
time
of
night
louise
speculated
do
you
think
penny
gave
her
chum
a
quick
little
jab
from
far
away
she
had
caught
the
sound
of
approaching
hoofbeats
the
headless
horseman
louise
whispered
in
awe
we
soon
see
lear
is
waiting
for
something
minutes
elapsed
penny
began
to
doubt
that
she
had
heard
an
approaching
horseman
then
suddenly
he
emerged
from
a
thicket
that
edged
the
valley
road
the
rider
was
garbed
in
white
which
plainly
silhouetted
his
huge
misshapen
body
where
his
head
should
have
been
there
was
nothing
the
sight
of
such
an
apparition
did
not
seem
to
dismay
old
lear
the
old
lady
leaned
farther
over
the
cliff
fairly
hugging
herself
with
delight
having
gained
the
road
leading
to
sleepy
hollow
the
horseman
came
on
at
a
swift
pace
sparks
flew
from
the
steel
shod
hoofs
as
they
clipped
smartly
on
the
stones
penny
gaze
swept
ahead
of
the
ghost
rider
to
the
bridge
her
heart
leaped
even
as
the
horseman
rode
onto
the
structure
workmen
sprang
from
the
thickets
at
either
side
of
the
road
high
wooden
barriers
were
jerked
into
place
at
both
ends
of
the
bridge
the
headless
horseman
retreat
was
cut
off
they
got
him
penny
whispered
tensely
he
trapped
on
the
bridge
the
horse
faltered
for
an
instant
and
slackened
speed
then
as
the
mysterious
rider
apparently
urged
him
on
he
bore
down
on
the
barrier
blocking
the
bridge
exit
he
going
to
try
to
jump
louise
murmured
but
no
one
could
take
such
a
high
barrier
nervously
the
girls
watched
by
this
time
they
were
certain
that
the
horse
was
trinidad
magnificent
though
he
was
age
had
crept
upon
him
and
the
wooden
gate
could
prove
a
difficult
test
for
a
trained
jumper
if
penny
and
louise
were
tense
lear
was
even
more
so
take
it
trinidad
they
heard
her
mutter
over
trinidad
did
not
falter
approaching
the
barrier
at
full
tilt
he
gathered
his
strength
and
cleared
the
structure
in
a
beautiful
clean
leap
the
startled
workmen
amazed
at
the
feat
fell
back
out
of
the
way
only
one
made
any
attempt
to
stop
the
rider
the
headless
horseman
plunged
his
gallant
steed
through
a
gap
in
the
trees
and
was
gone
you
did
it
trinidad
cackled
lear
you
showed
stooping
to
pick
up
a
pebble
the
old
lady
hurled
it
contemptuously
toward
the
bridge
her
aim
though
carelessly
taken
was
surprisingly
good
the
stone
fell
with
a
loud
resounding
thud
on
the
bridge
planks
let
wonder
where
that
came
from
the
old
lady
chuckled
gleefully
let
wonder
wrapping
her
black
coat
about
her
she
quickly
retreated
into
the
woods
chapter
fruitless
we
give
lear
a
little
start
and
then
follow
penny
instructed
undoubtedly
she
return
to
the
brook
to
meet
the
headless
horseman
then
you
believe
she
been
behind
the
scheme
from
the
first
louise
asked
backing
away
from
the
cliff
crumbling
edge
below
on
the
grounds
of
sleepy
hollow
men
roved
about
with
lighted
lanterns
apparently
no
very
vigorous
effort
was
being
made
to
pursue
the
mysterious
rider
into
the
woods
who
else
penny
countered
at
least
she
been
a
party
to
it
but
she
not
actually
the
rider
we
know
that
she
certainly
knows
the
identity
of
the
man
penny
said
with
conviction
and
we
should
too
before
the
night
over
come
on
fearful
lest
lear
get
too
much
of
a
start
the
girls
set
off
in
pursuit
however
they
had
not
gone
far
before
they
realized
that
the
old
lady
was
not
returning
to
the
brook
instead
she
seemed
to
be
heading
for
home
we
did
figure
this
so
well
after
all
penny
observed
in
deep
disgust
now
it
too
late
to
go
back
to
the
brook
so
we
lost
our
chance
to
learn
who
the
fellow
is
maybe
not
louise
said
cheerfully
someone
will
have
to
bring
trinidad
home
they
had
now
reached
the
main
road
with
lear
cabin
visible
over
the
hill
not
once
glancing
over
her
shoulder
the
old
lady
trod
a
muddy
path
to
her
own
gate
once
inside
the
grounds
she
peered
up
at
the
windows
of
the
bedroom
penny
and
louise
had
occupied
satisfied
that
no
light
was
burning
she
quietly
entered
the
house
the
two
girls
waited
for
awhile
in
the
woods
they
thought
it
wise
to
give
the
old
lady
ample
time
to
go
to
bed
and
fall
asleep
come
on
we
waited
long
enough
penny
said
at
last
they
crossed
the
road
and
stole
to
the
front
door
to
their
astonishment
it
was
locked
the
back
door
also
was
fastened
from
the
inside
we
have
to
try
a
window
penny
proposed
the
windows
also
were
locked
or
so
stuck
by
dampness
that
they
could
not
be
budged
if
this
is
a
pretty
mess
penny
exclaimed
impatiently
lear
never
used
to
lock
anything
she
must
have
started
doing
it
since
the
deed
to
her
property
disappeared
what
are
we
going
to
do
sleep
in
the
barn
that
might
not
be
such
a
bad
idea
then
if
trinidad
ever
comes
home
be
able
to
see
who
rode
him
you
have
to
get
another
idea
louise
retorted
that
old
barn
has
rats
and
mice
i
would
sleep
there
for
a
million
dollars
penny
circled
the
house
searching
for
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
she
could
find
no
ladder
a
rose
trellis
rising
along
the
front
wall
suggested
that
if
they
could
use
it
to
reach
the
second
story
they
might
creep
along
the
porch
roof
to
their
own
room
there
at
least
the
window
had
been
left
unlocked
it
looks
flimsy
penny
said
testing
the
structure
i
try
it
first
gingerly
she
climbed
the
trellis
trying
to
avoid
the
thorns
of
a
withered
rose
plant
she
reached
the
porch
roof
and
skillfully
rolled
onto
it
from
there
she
motioned
for
her
chum
to
follow
louise
was
heavier
than
penny
and
less
adept
at
climbing
the
rose
bush
tore
at
her
clothing
and
wounded
her
arms
just
as
she
was
reaching
for
penny
outstretched
hand
one
of
the
cross
pieces
gave
way
startled
louise
let
out
a
scream
of
terror
now
you
done
it
penny
muttered
pulling
her
by
brute
force
onto
the
porch
lear
deaf
if
she
did
hear
that
tiptoeing
with
frantic
haste
across
the
porch
roof
they
tested
the
window
of
their
bedroom
it
raised
easily
but
as
they
scrambled
over
the
sill
the
girls
were
dismayed
to
hear
lear
door
open
farther
down
the
hall
she
heard
us
louise
whispered
tensely
now
what
we
do
into
bed
and
cover
up
penny
ordered
not
even
taking
time
to
remove
their
shoes
they
made
a
dive
for
the
big
bed
scarcely
had
they
pulled
the
coverlet
up
to
their
ears
than
they
heard
lear
just
outside
the
door
are
you
all
right
she
called
anxiously
i
thought
i
heard
a
scream
the
girls
did
not
answer
they
closed
their
eyes
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
lear
opened
the
door
and
peeped
inside
not
entirely
satisfied
she
crossed
the
room
and
stood
for
a
moment
at
the
open
window
closing
it
half
way
she
then
tiptoed
out
the
door
was
that
a
close
call
penny
whispered
sitting
up
in
bed
lucky
for
us
she
did
notice
anything
wrong
waiting
a
few
minutes
longer
the
girls
slid
from
beneath
the
covers
and
quickly
undressed
at
least
we
learned
one
important
thing
tonight
penny
observed
quietly
lowering
a
shoe
to
the
floor
lear
is
behind
this
headless
horseman
escapade
but
who
is
the
fellow
silas
malcom
perhaps
only
he
a
bit
too
old
for
pranks
penny
did
not
reply
moving
to
the
window
she
gazed
thoughtfully
toward
the
barn
someone
may
bring
trinidad
back
she
commented
by
watching
not
for
me
louise
cut
in
she
rolled
back
into
bed
i
going
to
get
myself
a
little
before
dawn
penny
drew
a
chair
up
to
the
window
the
room
was
cold
her
chair
was
and
hard
minutes
dragged
by
and
still
trinidad
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
the
horse
may
not
come
back
tonight
penny
thought
covering
a
yawn
guess
i
jump
into
bed
i
can
hear
just
as
well
from
there
she
snuggled
in
beside
louise
and
enjoyed
the
warmth
of
the
covers
a
delightful
drowsiness
took
possession
of
her
though
she
struggled
to
stay
awake
her
eyelids
became
heavier
and
heavier
presently
penny
slept
she
slept
soundly
when
she
awakened
the
first
rays
of
morning
light
were
seeping
in
through
the
window
but
it
was
not
the
sun
that
had
aroused
her
from
slumber
as
she
stirred
drowsily
she
became
aware
of
an
unusual
sound
at
first
she
could
not
place
it
then
she
realized
that
someone
was
pounding
on
the
downstairs
screen
door
penny
nudged
louise
when
that
did
not
arouse
her
she
gave
her
a
vigorous
shake
what
now
louise
mumbled
crossly
wake
up
someone
downstairs
pounding
on
the
screen
door
let
pound
louise
rolled
away
from
her
chum
grasp
and
tried
to
go
back
to
sleep
the
thumping
noise
was
repeated
louder
and
more
insistent
penny
was
sure
she
heard
the
rumble
of
many
voices
thoroughly
puzzled
she
swung
out
of
bed
and
reached
for
a
robe
open
up
called
a
man
voice
from
below
penny
ran
to
the
window
the
porch
roof
half
obstructed
her
view
but
in
the
yard
she
could
see
at
least
half
a
dozen
men
others
were
at
the
door
hammering
to
be
let
in
by
this
time
the
thumpings
had
thoroughly
awakened
louise
she
too
deserted
the
bed
and
went
to
the
window
something
wrong
she
exclaimed
just
see
that
mob
of
men
warrant
they
here
to
make
trouble
for
lear
perhaps
because
of
what
happened
last
night
chapter
penny
and
louise
scrambled
into
their
clothes
as
they
pulled
on
their
shoes
they
heard
lear
going
down
the
hall
fearful
lest
she
encounter
trouble
they
hastened
to
overtake
her
before
she
reached
the
front
door
do
you
think
it
safe
to
let
those
men
in
penny
ventured
dubiously
why
should
i
open
the
door
lear
demanded
i
nothing
to
hide
she
gazed
sharply
at
penny
who
suddenly
was
at
a
loss
for
words
lear
swung
wide
the
door
to
face
the
group
of
men
on
the
porch
joe
quigley
was
there
and
so
was
silas
malcom
seeing
friends
penny
and
louise
felt
reassured
well
demanded
lear
though
not
in
an
unfriendly
tone
what
the
meaning
of
waking
a
body
up
in
the
middle
o
the
night
word
just
came
in
by
radio
joe
quigley
spoke
up
there
been
a
big
rain
over
goshen
way
i
could
have
told
you
that
last
night

replied
undisturbed

it
when
i
seen
them
big
clouds
bilin
up

oughter
get
out
o
here
right
away
added
silas
malcom
that
dam
at
huntley
lake
ai
safe

more
and
when
all
that
water
comes
down
from
goshen
it
ai
too
likely

hold

the
people
of
delta
leaving
for
the
hills
lear
asked
coldly
some
are
quigley
assured
her
we
urging
everyone
who
can
to
take
the
morning
train
a
few
stubborn
ones
like
yourself
refuse
to
budge
oh
so
i
stubborn
i
suppose
you
leaving
joe
quigley
that
different
i
have
a
job
to
do
and
i
ca
desert
my
post
at
the
depot
and
the
burmasters
are
they
leaving
we
on
our
way
up
to
the
estate
now
to
warn
them
i
make
you
a
bargain
lear
agreed
a
hard
glint
in
her
eye
if
burmaster
goes
then
i
go
too
but
so
long
as
she
stays
in
this
valley
i
not
stirrin
one
inch
you
both
as
stubborn
as
one
of
silas
mules
joe
quigley
said
impatiently
do
you
realize
that
your
life
is
in
danger
when
you
lived
as
long
as
i
have
young
man
life
ai
so
precious
as
some
other
things
if
you
wo
listen
to
reason
yourself
what
about
these
girls
quigley
turned
toward
penny
and
louise
lear
face
became
troubled
they
have
to
go
at
once
she
decided
what
time
that
train
out
o
delta
joe
quigley
replied
or
they
can
catch
it
at
witch
falls
at
eleven
getting
on
at
that
station
they
might
find
seats
we
pack
our
things
right
away
louise
promised
starting
for
the
stairs
penny
followed
reluctantly
though
she
realized
that
it
would
be
foolhardy
to
remain
she
did
not
want
to
leave
red
valley
particularly
she
disliked
to
desert
old
lear
if
lear
is
determined
to
stay
here
what
can
we
do
about
it
louise
argued
reasonably
you
know
our
folks
would
want
us
to
remain
the
girls
quickly
gathered
their
belongings
together
and
went
downstairs
again
to
their
surprise
lear
had
put
on
her
coat
and
was
preparing
to
accompany
the
men
to
sleepy
hollow
i
ai
leavin
fer
good
she
announced
observing
penny
astonished
gaze
leastwise
not
unless
the
burmasters
do
i
going
there
now
to
see
what
they
got
to
say
come
along
if
you
like
one
of
the
men
invited
the
girls
maybe
you
can
help
persuade
them
to
leave
the
valley
penny
and
louise
doubted
that
they
would
be
of
any
assistance
whatsoever
however
it
was
several
hours
before
train
time
so
they
were
very
glad
indeed
to
ride
in
one
of
the
cars
to
sleepy
hollow
estate
at
the
crossroad
joe
quigley
turned
back
to
delta
for
he
was
scheduled
to
go
on
duty
at
the
railroad
station
the
others
kept
on
until
they
reached
the
estate
silas
malcom
rapped
sharply
on
the
front
door
in
a
moment
a
light
went
on
in
an
upstairs
room
a
few
minutes
later
a
window
opened
and
burmaster
clad
in
pajamas
peered
down
what
wanted
he
demanded
angrily
there
been
a
big
rain
above
us
he
was
told
everyone
being
advised
to
get
out
while
there
time
burmaster
was
silent
a
moment
then
he
said
wait
a
minute
until
i
dress
we
talk
about
it
ten
minutes
elapsed
before
the
estate
owner
opened
the
front
door
and
bade
the
group
enter
he
led
the
party
into
a
luxuriously
furnished
living
room
now
what
is
all
this
burmaster
asked
we
had
one
disturbance
here
last
night
and
it
seems
to
me
that
about
enough
silas
malcom
explained
the
situation
speaking
quietly
but
with
force
and
who
says
that
the
dam
wo
hold
burmaster
interrupted
well
it
the
opinion
of
them
that
been
workin
on
it
for
the
past
two
weeks
if
we
had
money
and
enough
help
so
that
why
you
rooted
me
out
of
bed
we
came
here
to
do
you
a
favor
one
of
the
men
retorted
angrily
too
late
to
save
the
dam
unless
nature
sees
fit
to
spare
her
but
it
ai
too
late
for
you
and
your
household
to
get
out
of
here
i
have
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
sunk
in
this
place
that
a
heap
o
money
silas
said
thoughtfully
but
it
ai
going
to
mean
anything
to
you
if
that
dam
lets
go
you
ought
to
leave
here
without
waitin
perhaps
you
right
burmaster
said
pacing
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
fireplace
it
was
my
judgment
that
the
dam
would
hold
naturally
no
one
could
predict
these
heavy
unseasonable
rains
a
door
opened
everyone
turned
to
see
burmaster
on
the
threshold
her
hair
was
uncombed
and
she
wore
a
brilliant
red
housecoat
who
are
these
people
she
asked
her
husband
in
a
cold
voice
villagers
they
come
to
warn
us
that
we
ought
to
leave
here
warn
us
indeed
burmaster
retorted
bitterly
i
do
know
what
they
said
to
you
but
it
just
another
scheme
to
get
us
away
from
here
have
they
tried
everything
this
ai
no
headless
horseman
scare
spoke
silas
malcom
the
huntley
dam
is
likely
to
give
way
at
any
minute
i
heard
that
for
weeks
burmaster
gaze
was
scornful
oh
i
know
you
hated
us
ever
since
we
built
this
house
you
tried
every
imaginable
trick
to
make
us
leave
that
ai
true
silas
replied
soberly
burmaster
angry
gaze
swept
the
group
and
came
to
rest
on
lear
that
old
witch
who
lives
down
the
road
has
set
you
all
against
me
she
fairly
screamed
she
lied
and
fought
me
at
every
turn
lear
detached
herself
from
the
group
she
spoke
quietly
but
with
suppressed
fury
i
stood
a
lot
from
you
in
the
past
burmaster
she
retorted
but
there
ai
no
one
alive
can
call
me
a
witch
oh
i
ca
burmaster
mocked
well
you
worse
than
an
old
witch
at
least
i
ai
a
sneak
thief
i
do
go
breakin
into
folks
houses
to
steal
the
deed
to
their
property
how
dare
you
accuse
me
of
such
a
thing
because
i
know
you
got
the
deed
to
my
cabin
right
here
in
the
house
lear
accused
you
got
it
hid
away
that
a
lie
ladies
ladies
remonstrated
one
of
the
men
from
the
village
lear
paid
not
the
slightest
heed
advancing
toward
burmaster
she
waved
a
bony
finger
at
her
so
it
a
lie
is
it
she
cackled
well
let
me
tell
you
this
mary
gibson
that
worked
out
here
as
maid
until
last
wednesday
saw
that
deed
mine
in
your
bureau
drawer
she
told
me
herself
how
dare
you
say
such
a
thing
gasped
burmaster
burmaster
stepped
between
his
wife
and
lear
enough
of
this
he
said
firmly
we
know
nothing
about
the
deed
to
your
property
mrs
lear
then
prove
that
it
ai
here
the
old
lady
challenged
look
in
your
wife
bureau
drawer
and
see
certainly
since
you
have
made
such
an
accusation
we
shall
by
all
means
disprove
it
as
burmaster
started
toward
the
circular
stairway
his
wife
caught
nervously
at
his
arm
no
john
do
be
so
weak
as
to
give
in
to
her
lear
has
made
a
very
serious
accusation
against
you
we
must
prove
to
all
these
people
that
she
misjudged
you
you
ca
search
you
must
it
insulting
to
me
but
my
dear
i
never
speak
to
you
again
if
you
do
never
burmaster
hesitated
not
knowing
what
to
do
so
you
afraid
to
look
lear
needled
him
no
i
not
afraid
the
estate
owner
said
with
sudden
decision
furthermore
i
want
someone
to
accompany
me
as
witness
his
gaze
swept
the
little
group
and
singled
out
penny
will
you
come
penny
did
not
wish
to
be
drawn
into
the
feud
but
as
the
others
urged
her
to
accompany
burmaster
she
reluctantly
agreed
burmaster
bedroom
was
a
luxurious
chamber
directly
above
the
living
room
there
was
a
canopied
bed
with
beautiful
hangings
and
a
dressing
table
that
fairly
took
penny
breath
away
there
the
bureau
said
burmaster
pointing
to
another
massive
piece
of
furniture
suppose
you
search
rather
reluctantly
penny
opened
the
top
drawer
it
was
filled
with
lace
handkerchiefs
and
neat
boxes
of
stockings
the
second
drawer
contained
silk
lingerie
while
the
third
was
filled
with
odds
and
ends
so
it
not
there
burmaster
exclaimed
in
relief
as
penny
straightened
from
her
task
i
was
sure
it
would
be
from
the
tone
of
his
voice
it
was
evident
that
he
had
been
very
much
afraid
the
deed
would
be
found
penny
eyes
wandered
toward
the
dressing
table
you
may
as
well
search
there
too
burmaster
said
then
there
can
be
no
further
accusations
one
by
one
penny
opened
the
drawers
of
the
dressing
table
burmaster
jewel
box
caught
her
eye
it
was
filled
to
overflowing
with
bracelets
pins
and
valuable
necklaces
just
behind
the
big
silver
box
another
object
drew
her
attention
at
a
glance
she
knew
that
it
was
a
legal
document
as
she
picked
it
up
she
saw
that
it
was
the
deed
to
lear
property
what
that
burmaster
demanded
sharply
when
penny
did
not
speak
without
answering
she
gave
him
the
document
it
is
the
deed
he
exclaimed
dumbfounded
then
my
wife
did
steal
it
from
lear
but
why
why
would
she
do
such
a
thing
i
sure
she
did
realize
burmaster
is
a
sick
woman
a
very
sick
woman
the
estate
owner
said
unhappily
but
what
must
i
do
what
can
you
do
except
go
downstairs
and
tell
the
truth
face
them
all
admit
that
my
wife
is
a
thief
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
honorable
thing
is
to
return
the
deed
to
mrs
lear
the
deed
must
be
returned
burmaster
acknowledged
but
not
tonight
later
i
realize
that
you
wish
to
protect
your
wife
penny
said
quietly
natural
but
lear
has
to
be
considered
i
pay
you
handsomely
to
keep
quiet
about
this
burmaster
said
furthermore
i
promise
to
return
the
deed
to
lear
tomorrow
penny
shook
her
head
very
well
then
burmaster
sighed
i
suppose
i
must
face
them
i
do
mind
for
myself
it
my
wife
i
worried
about
she
apt
to
go
into
hysterics
tramping
down
the
stairs
the
estate
owner
confronted
the
little
group
of
villagers
in
a
few
words
he
acknowledged
that
the
deed
had
been
found
apologized
to
lear
and
placed
the
document
in
her
hands
throughout
the
speech
burmaster
stood
as
one
stricken
her
face
flushed
as
red
as
the
robe
she
wore
then
became
deathly
white
i
thank
you
burmaster
you
an
honorable
man
lear
said
stiffly
i
feel
mighty
sorry
fer
the
way
things
turned
out
maybe
oh
yes
everyone
can
see
that
you
sorry
burmaster
broke
in
shrilly
you
a
hateful
scheming
old
hag
now
get
out
of
my
house
get
out
all
of
you
and
never
come
back
about
the
dam
silas
malcom
started
to
say
the
dam
burmaster
screamed
let
it
break
i
wish
it
would
then
i
never
see
any
of
you
again
go
on
get
out
do
you
hear
me
get
out
the
little
group
retreated
toward
the
door
burmaster
did
not
wait
to
see
the
villagers
leave
weeping
hysterically
she
ran
from
the
room
chapter
rain
splattered
steadily
against
the
car
windows
as
the
noon
passenger
train
pulled
from
the
witch
falls
station
penny
and
louise
watched
the
plump
drops
join
into
fat
rivulets
which
raced
one
another
to
the
sill
since
saying
goodbye
to
lear
silas
malcom
and
their
other
valley
friends
they
had
not
done
much
talking
they
felt
too
discouraged
i
wish
we
decided
to
catch
the
train
at
delta
penny
remarked
settling
herself
for
the
long
ride
home
then
we
could
have
said
goodbye
to
joe
quigley
we
be
passing
through
the
station
soon
louise
nodded
morosely
things
certainly
ended
in
one
grand
mess
she
commented
lear
got
the
deed
to
her
property
back
but
the
feud
will
be
worse
than
ever
now
furthermore
we
never
did
solve
the
headless
horseman
mystery
not
that
it
matters
reaching
for
a
discarded
newspaper
which
lay
on
the
coach
seat
penny
shot
her
chum
a
quick
knowing
look
just
what
does
that
mean
louise
demanded
alertly
penny
pretended
not
to
understand
you
gave
me
one
of
those
looks
louise
accused
just
as
if
you
solved
the
mystery
i
assure
you
i
have
and
never
will
now
that
we
leaving
the
valley
but
you
do
have
an
idea
who
was
back
of
the
scheme
lear
of
course
we
saw
that
much
with
our
own
eyes
but
we
did
learn
who
actually
rode
the
horse
or
did
you
not
exactly
you
do
know
then
no
penny
denied
soberly
i
noticed
something
about
the
rider
that
made
me
think
but
then
i
better
not
say
it
please
go
on
no
i
have
no
proof
it
would
only
be
a
guess
i
think
you
mean
to
keep
me
in
the
dark
louise
pouted
maybe
i
tell
you
my
theory
later
penny
replied
opening
the
newspaper
just
now
i
not
in
the
mood
both
girls
had
been
strangely
depressed
by
their
last
few
hours
in
the
valley
lear
had
refused
to
come
with
them
or
to
seek
refuge
in
the
hills
gleeful
at
her
victory
over
burmaster
she
had
seemed
insensible
to
danger
look
at
this
headline
penny
said
indicating
the
black
type
of
the
newspaper
flood
menaces
red
valley
quickly
the
girls
scanned
the
story
the
account
mentioned
no
facts
new
to
them
it
merely
repeated
that
residents
of
the
valley
were
alarmed
by
heavy
rains
which
had
raised
lake
huntley
to
a
dangerous
height
behind
the
dam
wonder
if
salt
got
any
good
pictures
when
he
was
here
yesterday
penny
mused
probably
not
this
is
the
sort
of
news
story
that
does
amount
to
much
unless
the
big
calamity
falls
you
do
think
the
dam
actually
will
give
way
louise
asked
anxiously
how
should
i
know
even
the
experts
ca
agree
at
any
rate
we
leaving
here
and
i
glad
somehow
i
had
an
uneasy
feeling
ever
since
last
night
penny
nodded
and
glanced
from
the
car
window
again
rain
kept
splashing
fiercely
against
the
thick
pane
half
obscuring
the
distant
hills
along
the
right
of
way
muddy
water
ran
in
deep
torrents
washing
fence
and
hedgerow
as
the
train
snailed
along
toward
delta
there
was
increasing
evidence
of
flood
damage
a
row
of
shacks
near
the
railroad
tracks
was
half
submerged
along
the
creek
beds
giant
trees
bowed
their
branches
to
the
swirling
water
many
landmarks
were
completely
blotted
out
we
coming
into
delta
now
penny
presently
observed
perhaps
if
we
watch
sharp
we
see
joe
quigley
and
can
say
goodbye
the
train
stopped
with
a
jerk
while
still
some
distance
from
the
station
then
it
pulled
to
a
siding
and
there
it
waited
after
ten
minutes
penny
sauntered
through
the
train
thinking
that
if
she
could
find
an
open
door
she
might
get
out
and
walk
to
the
depot
stopping
a
porter
who
was
passing
through
the
car
she
asked
him
the
cause
of
the
delay
waitin
fo
ordehs
the
colored
man
answered
anyhow
dat
what
de
says
the
captain
the
conducteh
o
dis
heah
train
oh
and
what
does
he
say
about
the
high
water
he
says
de
track
between
heah
and
hobostein
a
foot
undeh
then
that
means
the
river
must
be
coming
up
fast
any
danger
we
be
stranded
at
delta
you
betteh
talk
to
de
conductor
the
porter
said
jerking
his
head
toward
a
fat
bespectacled
trainman
who
had
just
swung
aboard
the
coach
dat
mr
johnson
penny
stopped
the
conductor
to
ask
him
what
the
chances
were
of
getting
through
the
flooded
area
does
look
so
good
he
rumbled
the
rails
are
under
at
mile
posts
and
then
we
tied
up
here
no
we
going
as
far
as
we
can
the
conductor
answered
the
dispatcher
sending
a
work
train
on
ahead
to
feel
out
the
track
but
we
be
lucky
to
make
ten
miles
an
hour
penny
chatted
with
the
conductor
for
a
few
minutes
then
ambled
back
to
the
coach
where
she
had
left
louise
the
prospects
were
most
discouraging
at
best
it
would
be
late
afternoon
before
they
could
hope
to
reach
riverview
i
starving
too
louise
said
i
suppose
there
no
diner
on
this
train
as
a
stop
gap
the
girls
hailed
a
passing
vendor
and
bought
candy
bars
having
thus
satisfied
their
hunger
they
tried
to
read
magazines
presently
the
car
started
with
a
jerk
however
instead
of
proceeding
toward
the
station
it
backed
into
the
railroad
yard
now
what
penny
demanded
impatiently
are
we
ever
going
to
start
the
porter
hastened
through
the
car
his
manner
noticeably
nervous
and
tense
he
paid
no
heed
to
a
woman
passenger
who
sought
to
detain
him
something
wrong
penny
said
with
conviction
a
do
you
think
might
be
let
see
what
we
can
learn
with
a
vague
feeling
of
foreboding
they
could
not
have
explained
the
girls
arose
and
followed
the
porter
something
was
amiss
they
were
certain
of
it
losing
sight
of
the
colored
man
they
kept
on
until
they
reached
the
rear
platform
penny
started
to
open
the
screen
door
just
then
the
train
whistle
sounded
a
shrill
unending
blast
startled
louise
gripped
her
chum
hand
listening
tensely
in
the
car
behind
they
heard
the
conductor
husky
voice
he
was
shouting
run
run
for
your
lives
take
to
the
hills
penny
was
stunned
for
an
instant
then
seizing
louise
arm
she
pulled
her
out
on
the
train
platform
at
first
glance
nothing
appeared
wrong
the
tracks
were
well
above
the
river
level
between
the
road
bed
and
a
high
hill
on
the
left
flood
water
was
running
like
a
mill
race
but
the
ditch
was
narrow
and
represented
no
immediate
danger
listen
penny
cried
from
far
away
there
came
a
deep
rumbling
roar
not
unlike
the
sound
of
distant
thunder
leaning
far
over
the
train
platform
railing
penny
gazed
up
the
tracks
the
sight
which
met
her
eyes
left
her
momentarily
paralyzed
down
the
valley
charged
a
great
wall
of
water
taking
everything
before
it
trees
had
been
mowed
down
crushed
houses
were
being
carried
along
like
children
blocks
far
up
the
track
a
switch
engine
was
lifted
bodily
from
the
rails
and
hurled
backwards
penny
waited
to
see
no
more
the
dam
given
away
she
shouted
quick
louise
climb
over
the
railing
and
run
for
your
life
chapter
leaping
over
the
platform
railing
penny
held
up
her
arms
to
assist
louise
now
awakened
to
danger
her
chum
scrambled
wildly
after
her
only
to
stop
aghast
as
she
beheld
the
gigantic
wall
of
water
rushing
toward
them
jump
the
ditch
and
make
for
the
hill
penny
ordered
tersely
be
quick
passengers
were
pouring
from
the
other
cars
their
terrified
cries
drowned
by
the
grinding
roar
of
the
onrushing
torrent
the
wall
of
water
moved
with
incredible
speed
it
tore
into
the
railroad
yard
shattering
a
tool
house
and
a
coal
dock
it
roared
on
sweeping
a
row
of
empty
box
cars
into
its
maw
spurred
by
the
sight
penny
and
louise
tried
to
leap
the
ditch
they
fell
far
short
and
both
plunged
into
the
boiling
water
up
to
their
arm
pits
penny
feet
anchored
solidly
with
a
gigantic
shove
she
helped
louise
to
safety
by
swimming
with
the
current
she
then
reached
shore
a
few
yards
farther
down
the
railroad
right
of
way
run
she
shouted
to
the
bewildered
bedraggled
louise
up
the
hill
scrambling
over
the
muddy
edge
of
the
ditch
she
raced
after
her
chum
for
higher
ground
just
then
the
wall
of
water
swept
into
the
siding
as
the
train
was
struck
it
seemed
to
shudder
from
the
terrific
impact
then
slowly
settled
on
its
side
horrible
louise
shuddered
some
of
the
passengers
may
have
been
trapped
in
there
most
of
them
escaped
penny
gasped
there
goes
the
water
tower
a
building
borne
by
the
flood
rammed
into
the
ironwork
of
the
big
dripping
tower
it
crumpled
falling
with
a
great
shuddering
splash
with
the
of
the
flood
sloshing
against
their
knees
the
girls
raced
for
high
ground
reaching
a
point
midway
up
the
hill
where
other
passengers
had
paused
they
turned
to
glance
below
yellow
angry
water
rising
easily
ten
feet
flowed
over
the
railroad
right
of
way
with
unbelievable
speed
the
flood
rolled
on
in
one
angry
gulp
it
reached
a
long
freight
train
farther
down
the
track
the
caboose
and
a
string
of
coal
cars
were
lifted
and
hurled
strangely
the
coal
tender
and
engine
which
had
been
detached
remained
on
the
rails
oh
look
louise
gasped
in
horror
the
engineer
trapped
in
the
cab
the
trainman
plainly
visible
valiantly
kept
the
engine
whistle
blowing
higher
and
higher
rose
the
water
penny
and
louise
were
certain
the
courageous
man
must
meet
his
doom
but
the
crest
of
the
flood
already
had
swept
on
down
the
valley
and
in
a
moment
the
waters
about
the
engine
remained
at
a
standstill
so
quickly
had
disaster
struck
that
the
girls
could
not
immediately
comprehend
the
extent
of
the
tragedy
from
their
own
train
nearly
all
of
the
passengers
had
escaped
but
the
town
of
delta
had
not
fared
so
well
apparently
the
flood
had
roared
through
the
low
section
taking
all
before
it
farther
up
the
valley
directly
below
huntley
lake
where
the
gorge
was
narrow
damage
to
life
and
property
might
be
even
greater
what
chance
could
poor
lear
have
had
louise
said
brokenly
or
the
burmasters
there
a
possibility
they
took
to
the
hills
in
time
i
doubt
it
louise
said
grimly
the
flood
came
so
quickly
already
the
yellow
muddy
waters
were
carrying
evidence
of
their
work
houses
many
with
men
and
women
clinging
desperately
to
rooftops
floated
past
other
helpless
victims
clung
to
logs
orange
crates
and
chicken
coops
at
terrific
speed
they
sailed
past
the
base
of
the
hillside
several
shouted
piteously
for
help
we
must
do
something
to
save
those
people
penny
cried
desperately
what
louise
asked
by
this
time
the
hillside
was
dotted
with
people
who
had
saved
themselves
several
of
the
women
were
weeping
hysterically
another
had
fainted
for
the
most
part
everyone
stared
almost
stupidly
at
the
endless
stream
of
debris
which
was
swept
down
the
valley
no
one
knew
how
to
aid
the
agonized
victims
who
clung
to
whatever
their
fingers
could
clutch
on
one
rooftop
penny
counted
six
persons
the
sight
drove
her
to
action
if
only
we
had
a
rope
she
cried
and
broke
off
as
her
eyes
roved
up
the
hillside
two
hundred
yards
away
stood
a
farmhouse
i
see
if
i
can
get
one
there
she
cried
darting
away
the
hill
was
steep
the
ground
soft
penny
wet
clothing
impeded
her
she
tripped
over
a
stone
and
fell
but
scrambling
up
ran
on
finally
quite
out
of
breath
she
reached
the
farmhouse
a
woman
with
two
small
children
clinging
to
her
dress
met
the
girl
in
the
yard
ai
it
awful
she
murmured
brokenly
my
husband
workin
down
at
the
brandale
works
did
the
flood
strike
there
it
must
have
spread
through
all
of
delta
penny
answered
this
disaster
going
to
be
frightful
unless
we
can
get
help
quickly
do
you
have
a
telephone
yes
but
it
dead
the
wire
runs
into
delta
penny
had
been
afraid
of
that
she
doubted
that
a
single
telephone
pole
had
been
left
standing
in
the
town
nor
was
it
likely
that
the
other
valley
cities
had
service
do
you
have
a
rope
she
asked
a
long
one
in
the
barn
i
get
it
the
woman
came
back
in
a
moment
a
coil
of
rope
over
her
arm
send
some
of
those
poor
folks
up
here
she
urged
as
penny
started
away
with
the
rope
i
put
on
a
wash
boiler
of
coffee
and
take
care
of
as
many
as
i
can
half
sliding
penny
descended
the
steep
hillside
during
her
absence
two
persons
had
been
rescued
from
the
water
by
means
of
an
improvised
lasso
made
from
torn
strips
of
clothing
others
were
drifting
past
too
far
away
to
be
reached
a
woman
and
a
child
floated
past
clinging
to
a
log
penny
stood
ready
the
rope
coiled
neatly
at
her
feet
she
took
careful
aim
knowing
that
if
she
missed
she
would
have
no
second
chance
penny
hurled
the
rope
and
it
ran
free
falling
just
ahead
of
the
helpless
pair
the
mother
reached
with
one
hand
and
seized
it
before
it
sank
beneath
the
surface
hold
on
penny
shouted
do
let
go
several
men
ran
to
help
her
by
working
together
they
were
able
to
pull
the
woman
and
her
child
to
safety
abandoning
the
rope
to
skilled
hands
penny
rounded
the
hill
to
a
point
providing
a
clear
view
of
the
flooded
railroad
yard
the
roundhouse
the
coal
chutes
and
the
signal
tower
were
gone
but
her
heart
leaped
to
see
that
the
station
was
still
standing
built
on
high
ground
it
was
surrounded
with
water
which
did
not
appear
to
be
deep
penny
turned
to
louise
who
had
followed
her
just
then
they
both
heard
someone
shout
that
the
railroad
bridge
was
being
swept
away
they
saw
the
massive
steel
structure
swing
slowly
from
its
stone
foundation
one
side
held
firm
which
immediately
set
up
great
swirling
currents
any
persons
carried
that
way
would
be
faced
with
destruction
in
the
whirling
pools
of
water
it
too
late
to
warn
the
towns
directly
below
delta
penny
gasped
but
there
still
may
be
time
to
get
a
message
through
to
hobostein
in
any
case
we
must
get
help
here
but
how
louise
asked
hopelessly
any
wires
that
were
left
standing
must
have
been
torn
away
when
the
bridge
went
penny
gazed
again
toward
the
delta
depot
between
it
and
the
hillside
ran
a
stretch
of
water
yet
separated
from
the
main
body
of
the
racing
flood
if
only
i
could
get
over
to
the
station
i
might
somehow
send
a
message
do
be
crazy
louise
remonstrated
you
have
a
chance
to
cross
that
stretch
of
water
i
think
i
could
i
a
pretty
fair
swimmer
but
the
current
is
so
swift
there
a
certain
amount
of
risk
penny
admitted
soberly
but
we
stand
here
and
wait
someone
must
do
something
to
bring
help
do
do
it
penny
louise
pleaded
please
penny
hesitated
but
only
for
an
instant
she
understood
perfectly
that
if
she
misjudged
the
strength
of
the
current
it
would
sweep
her
down
perhaps
carry
her
along
into
the
main
body
of
water
once
in
the
grip
of
that
angry
torrent
no
one
could
hope
to
battle
against
it
the
risk
however
was
one
she
felt
she
must
take
struggling
free
from
louise
clinging
hands
she
kicked
off
her
shoes
and
tucked
up
her
skirt
then
she
plunged
into
the
swirling
water
chapter
the
current
was
much
swifter
than
penny
had
anticipated
it
tugged
viciously
at
her
feet
giving
her
no
opportunity
to
inch
her
way
along
the
ditch
a
dozen
steps
and
she
was
beyond
her
depth
fighting
desperately
to
keep
from
being
swept
with
the
current
although
a
strong
swimmer
penny
found
herself
no
match
for
the
wild
torrent
only
by
going
with
it
could
she
keep
her
head
above
water
to
attempt
to
swim
against
it
was
impossible
despairingly
she
saw
that
she
would
miss
the
railroad
station
by
many
yards
i
be
swept
into
the
main
body
of
the
flood
she
thought
in
panic
i
should
have
attempted
it
too
late
she
tried
to
turn
back
toward
the
hillside
the
swift
current
held
her
relentlessly
struggling
against
it
her
head
went
under
she
choked
as
she
breathed
water
then
fought
her
way
to
the
surface
again
the
current
carried
her
on
after
that
first
moment
of
panic
penny
did
not
waste
her
strength
uselessly
allowing
the
flood
to
carry
her
along
she
took
only
a
few
slow
strokes
swimming
just
enough
to
keep
from
being
pulled
beneath
the
surface
as
calmly
as
she
could
she
appraised
the
situation
the
station
now
was
very
close
scarcely
fifty
yards
separated
her
from
it
but
she
knew
her
physical
powers
her
strength
was
no
match
for
that
racing
swirling
current
she
could
not
hope
to
span
the
distance
short
though
it
was
penny
despaired
and
then
her
heart
leaped
with
new
hope
directly
ahead
a
foot
and
a
half
above
the
water
murky
surface
rose
a
steel
rod
with
red
and
green
signal
targets
she
recognized
the
object
as
a
switch
stand
used
by
trainmen
to
open
and
close
the
passing
track
switch
if
i
could
reach
that
steel
rod
i
could
hold
on
she
thought
but
do
i
have
the
strength
the
swift
current
swept
penny
on
toward
the
upright
rod
she
took
three
four
powerful
strokes
and
reached
frantically
for
the
standard
her
fingers
closed
around
the
metal
the
swift
flowing
water
whipped
her
violently
but
she
held
fast
drawing
herself
close
to
the
rod
she
shoved
her
feet
downward
still
she
could
find
no
bottom
hopefully
penny
glanced
toward
the
station
now
less
than
yards
away
although
water
completely
surrounded
the
squat
little
building
it
had
not
risen
to
the
window
level
yet
there
was
no
sign
of
anyone
near
the
place
no
one
to
help
her
still
clinging
to
the
rod
she
groped
again
with
her
bare
feet
this
time
she
located
a
steel
rail
by
standing
on
it
she
raised
herself
a
few
inches
and
found
firm
footing
suddenly
an
idea
came
to
her
if
i
shove
off
hard
from
this
rail
maybe
i
can
get
enough
momentum
to
carry
me
through
the
current
if
i
fail
penny
decided
not
to
think
about
that
releasing
her
hold
on
the
rod
she
pushed
off
with
all
her
strength
and
began
to
swim
digging
her
face
into
the
water
she
held
her
breath
and
put
everything
she
had
into
each
stroke
pull
pull
pull
she
had
to
keep
on
her
breath
was
nearly
gone
strength
fast
was
deserting
her
yet
to
turn
her
head
and
gulp
air
might
spell
defeat
when
victory
was
near
she
could
feel
the
torrent
swinging
her
downstream
she
made
a
final
desperate
spurt
i
ca
make
it
she
thought
i
ca
yet
she
struggled
on
then
suddenly
her
churning
feet
struck
a
solid
object
it
was
the
brick
platform
of
the
station
raising
her
head
she
saw
the
building
loom
up
in
front
of
her
the
current
no
longer
tugged
at
her
body
she
had
reached
quiet
water
penny
stood
still
a
moment
regaining
her
breath
then
she
waded
to
the
front
door
of
the
station
it
could
not
be
opened
penny
pounded
and
shouted
her
cries
went
unanswered
the
place
is
deserted
she
thought
with
a
sinking
heart
joe
quigley
must
have
taken
to
the
hills
when
the
flood
came
slowly
penny
waded
around
the
building
unwilling
to
acknowledge
failure
somehow
she
had
to
get
word
of
the
disaster
through
to
the
outside
world
yet
even
if
she
did
get
inside
the
station
she
was
far
from
certain
it
would
do
any
good
telephone
wires
undoubtedly
were
down
penny
made
a
complete
circuit
of
the
depot
without
seeing
anyone
sick
with
disappointment
she
paused
beside
the
bay
of
the
ticket
office
and
peered
inside
she
could
see
no
one
but
as
she
pressed
her
face
against
the
pane
of
glass
she
thought
she
heard
the
chatter
of
a
telegraph
instrument
that
means
there
still
must
be
a
wire
connection
she
thought
hopefully
nearby
the
flood
had
lodged
a
small
board
against
the
depot
wall
seizing
it
penny
smashed
the
lower
pane
of
glass
with
one
blow
she
scrambled
through
the
opening
crawled
over
the
operator
table
and
dropped
to
the
floor
the
little
ticket
office
was
deserted
though
joe
quigley
hat
still
lay
on
the
counter
if
only
i
knew
how
to
telegraph
penny
despaired
hearing
again
the
chatter
of
the
instrument
just
knowing
morse
code
wo
help
me
much
the
telegraph
sounder
was
signaling
the
station
call
for
delta
over
and
over
it
was
repeated
penny
hesitated
and
then
went
to
the
instrument
she
opened
the
key
and
answered
with
the
station
call
where
have
you
been
for
the
past
twenty
minutes
the
train
dispatcher
sent
angrily
at
top
speed
what
happened
to
no
penny
got
only
part
of
the
message
and
guessed
at
the
rest
nervously
at
very
slow
speed
she
tapped
out
in
morse
code
that
the
train
had
been
washed
off
the
track
the
dispatcher
next
message
came
very
slowly
disclosing
that
he
knew
from
penny
style
of
sending
that
he
was
talking
to
an
amateur
telegrapher
where
joe
quigley
he
asked
in
code
do
know
penny
tapped
again
station
half
under
water
can
you
send
help
shoot
me
the
facts
straight
came
the
terse
order
penny
described
what
had
happened
at
huntley
dam
and
told
how
the
railroad
bridge
had
washed
out
in
return
the
dispatcher
assured
her
that
a
relief
crew
would
be
sent
without
delay
stay
on
the
job
until
relieved
was
his
final
order
weak
with
excitement
penny
leaned
back
in
her
chair
help
actually
was
on
the
way
the
dispatcher
would
notify
the
proper
authorities
and
set
in
motion
the
wheels
of
various
relief
organizations
for
the
moment
she
had
done
all
she
could
she
listened
tensely
as
the
dispatcher
crisp
call
flashed
over
the
wire
he
was
notifying
stations
farther
up
the
line
to
hold
all
trains
running
into
the
valley
repeatedly
penny
heard
the
call
which
she
took
to
be
witch
falls
it
went
unanswered
half
sick
with
dread
she
waited
hoping
for
a
response
it
was
likely
almost
a
certainty
that
the
station
had
been
swept
away
for
the
town
would
have
been
squarely
in
the
path
of
the
flood
what
had
happened
to
old
lear
and
the
burmasters
penny
tried
not
to
think
about
it
unexpectedly
the
outside
office
door
opened
joe
quigley
bedraggled
and
haggard
one
arm
hanging
limp
at
his
side
splashed
toward
the
desk
seeing
penny
he
stopped
short
yet
seemed
too
dazed
to
question
the
girl
presence
in
the
inner
office
it
awful
he
mumbled
i
was
on
the
station
platform
when
i
saw
that
wall
of
water
coming
tried
to
warn
the
men
in
the
roundhouse
before
i
could
cross
the
tracks
it
was
too
late
one
terrific
crash
and
the
roundhouse
disappeared
you
hurt
penny
cried
as
the
agent
reeled
against
the
wall
your
arm
is
crushed
how
did
it
happen
do
know
joe
admitted
sinking
into
a
chair
the
girl
offered
i
was
knocked
off
my
feet
came
to
lying
in
a
pile
of
boards
that
had
snagged
against
a
tree
trunk
he
stared
at
penny
as
if
really
seeing
her
for
the
first
time
say
he
demanded
how
did
you
get
in
here
smashed
the
window
it
was
the
only
way
the
agent
got
to
his
feet
staggering
toward
the
telegraph
desk
i
got
to
send
a
message
he
said
jerkily
no
due
at
rodney
in
twenty
minutes
all
the
trains
have
been
stopped
by
the
dispatcher
penny
reassured
him
and
explained
how
she
had
sent
out
the
call
for
help
joe
quigley
slumped
back
in
the
chair
if
you
can
telegraph
let
the
dispatcher
know
i
on
the
job
again
this
hand
of
mine
not
so
hot
for
sending
penny
obediently
sent
the
stumbling
message
but
as
she
completed
it
the
telegraph
sounder
became
lifeless
although
she
still
could
manipulate
the
key
the
signals
had
faded
completely
now
what
she
cried
bewildered
the
wire
dead
quigley
exclaimed
anxiously
he
glanced
toward
the
storage
batteries
fearing
that
water
had
damped
them
out
however
the
boxes
were
high
above
the
floor
and
still
dry
what
can
be
wrong
penny
asked
the
operator
anything
can
happen
in
a
mess
like
this
reaching
across
the
table
with
his
good
hand
quigley
tested
the
wire
by
opening
and
closing
the
lifeless
telegraph
key
it
completely
out
he
declared
with
finality
is
there
anything
we
can
do
quigley
got
to
his
feet
there
just
one
chance
the
wire
may
have
grounded
when
the
bridge
was
swept
away
then
if
it
tore
loose
again
be
out
of
service
in
that
case
we
up
against
it
maybe
not
quigley
replied
he
splashed
across
the
room
to
the
switchboard
if
that
should
happen
to
be
the
trouble
we
can
ground
it
here
he
inserted
a
plug
in
the
groundplate
of
the
switchboard
immediately
the
sounder
came
to
life
closing
with
a
sharp
click
i
call
that
luck
grinned
quigley
now
let
try
that
dispatcher
want
to
get
him
on
the
wire
for
me
penny
nodded
and
sat
down
at
the
desk
again
insistently
she
sent
out
the
call
all
the
while
as
she
kept
the
key
moving
her
thoughts
raced
ahead
she
was
afraid
that
persons
had
lost
their
lives
in
the
flood
property
damage
was
beyond
estimate
but
catastrophe
spelled
big
news
and
she
was
certain
her
father
would
want
every
detail
of
the
story
for
the
if
only
she
could
send
word
to
him
what
the
matter
quigley
asked
his
voice
impatient
ca
you
get
an
answer
just
then
it
came
a
crisp
i
ds
which
told
the
two
listeners
that
the
train
dispatcher
again
was
on
the
wire
quigley
took
over
explaining
the
break
in
service
and
giving
the
dispatcher
such
facts
as
he
desired
hovering
at
the
agent
elbow
penny
asked
him
if
the
dispatcher
would
take
an
important
personal
message
for
the
she
added
quickly
my
father
newspaper
i
doubt
he
do
it
quigley
discouraged
her
this
one
wire
is
needed
for
vital
railroad
messages
but
we
see
he
tapped
out
a
message
and
the
reply
came
it
was
sent
so
fast
that
penny
could
not
understand
the
code
quigley
translated
it
as
okay
but
make
it
brief
with
no
time
to
compose
a
carefully
worded
message
penny
reported
the
bare
facts
of
the
disaster
she
addressed
the
message
to
her
father
and
signed
her
own
name
there
that
off
quigley
said
sagging
back
in
his
chair
penny
saw
that
the
station
agent
was
in
no
condition
to
carry
on
his
work
you
in
bad
shape
she
said
anxiously
let
me
bandage
that
smashed
hand
it
nothing
i
be
okay
i
find
something
to
tie
it
up
with
penny
insisted
in
search
of
bandage
material
she
crossed
the
room
to
a
wall
closet
as
she
reached
for
the
door
handle
quigley
turned
swiftly
in
his
chair
no
not
there
he
exclaimed
penny
already
had
opened
the
door
her
gaze
fastened
upon
a
white
roll
of
cloth
on
the
top
shelf
she
reached
for
it
and
it
came
fluttering
down
into
her
hands
a
loose
garment
fashioned
somewhat
like
a
cape
with
tiny
slits
cut
for
eyes
in
an
instant
she
knew
what
it
was
slowly
she
turned
to
face
joe
quigley
so
it
was
you
she
whispered
accusingly
the
headless
horseman
of
sleepy
hollow
chapter
mystery
joe
quigley
did
not
deny
the
accusation
he
slumped
at
the
telegraph
desk
staring
straight
before
him
why
did
you
do
it
penny
asked
how
could
you
i
do
know
now
quigley
answered
heavily
it
seemed
like
a
good
idea
at
the
time
penny
shook
out
the
garment
the
whole
when
worn
over
one
head
would
give
an
appearance
of
a
sheeted
goblin
with
body
cut
off
at
the
shoulders
she
tore
off
a
long
strip
of
the
material
and
began
to
wrap
quigley
injured
hand
you
known
for
a
long
time
have
you
he
asked
diffidently
i
suspected
it
but
i
was
sure
penny
replied
your
style
of
riding
is
rather
spectacular
last
night
when
i
saw
trinidad
leap
the
barrier
at
sleepy
hollow
i
thought
i
knew
nothing
matters
now
quigley
said
self
accusingly
sleepy
gone
do
you
think
lear
and
the
burmasters
had
any
chance
to
reach
the
hills
i
doubt
it
when
the
dam
broke
the
water
raced
down
the
valley
with
the
speed
of
an
express
train
probably
they
were
caught
like
rats
in
a
trap
it
seems
too
horrible
i
knew
this
would
happen
quigley
went
on
it
was
what
i
fought
against
we
tried
through
the
delta
citizens
committee
to
get
burmaster
to
help
repair
the
dam
before
it
was
too
late
you
know
what
luck
we
had
so
failing
in
ordinary
methods
you
tried
to
bring
him
around
with
your
headless
horseman
stunt
it
was
a
foolish
idea
quigley
acknowledged
lear
really
put
me
up
to
it
not
that
i
trying
to
throw
any
blame
on
her
she
never
liked
burmaster
and
for
good
reasons
the
headless
horseman
affair
started
out
as
a
prank
and
then
i
thought
i
saw
a
chance
to
influence
burmaster
that
way
at
that
he
might
have
come
around
if
it
had
been
for
his
wife
yes
she
was
against
the
town
from
the
first
she
hated
everyone
why
she
believed
that
our
only
thought
was
to
get
her
away
from
the
valley
just
to
trick
her
i
guess
it
does
matter
now
penny
said
the
estate
gone
and
everyone
with
it
somehow
i
ca
realize
it
things
happened
so
fast
this
is
a
horrible
disaster
and
it
will
be
worse
if
help
does
get
here
fast
quigley
replied
fortunately
the
water
does
seem
to
be
coming
higher
penny
had
completed
a
rough
bandaging
job
on
the
station
agent
hand
thanking
her
he
got
up
to
test
the
two
office
telephones
both
were
out
of
service
presently
a
message
came
in
over
the
telegraph
wire
it
was
addressed
to
penny
and
was
from
her
father
quigley
copied
it
on
a
pad
and
handed
it
to
her
thank
god
you
are
safe
the
message
read
a
special
circuit
will
be
cut
through
to
the
delta
station
as
soon
as
possible
can
you
give
us
a
complete
running
story
of
the
flood
what
a
running
story
quigley
asked
curiously
i
think
dad
wants
me
to
gather
every
fact
i
can
penny
explained
he
wants
a
continuous
story
enough
material
to
fill
a
wire
for
several
hours
you
do
it
i
do
know
penny
said
doubtfully
i
never
handled
a
story
as
big
as
this
i
had
no
experience
on
anything
so
important
there
no
other
person
to
do
it
i
want
to
find
louise
penny
went
on
rereading
the
message
i
ought
to
try
to
learn
what
happened
to
poor
lear
and
the
burmasters
listen
quigley
argued
quietly
you
ca
do
anything
for
your
friends
now
do
you
see
it
your
duty
to
get
news
out
to
the
country
your
father
expects
it
of
you
penny
remained
silent
do
you
realize
there
no
one
else
to
send
the
news
quigley
demanded
you
probably
the
only
reporter
within
miles
of
here
but
i
not
really
a
reporter
i
written
stories
for
dad
paper
it
true
but
not
big
stories
such
as
this
red
valley
needs
help
the
only
way
to
get
it
is
by
arousing
the
public
do
i
wire
your
father
or
make
it
penny
decided
tell
dad
i
try
to
have
something
for
him
in
an
hour
you
need
longer
than
that
quigley
advised
anyhow
it
apt
to
be
several
hours
before
we
get
a
special
wire
through
while
the
agent
sent
the
message
penny
searched
the
office
for
pencil
and
paper
you
wo
get
far
without
shoes
quigley
said
over
his
shoulder
what
became
of
yours
left
them
over
on
the
hillside
well
you
ca
go
back
for
them
now
quigley
replied
gazing
ruefully
through
the
window
at
the
racing
torrent
which
separated
the
station
from
the
high
hill
let
see
what
we
can
find
for
you
he
rummaged
through
the
closet
and
came
upon
a
pair
of
boots
which
looked
nearly
small
enough
for
penny
we
had
a
boy
who
wore
those
when
he
worked
here
he
explained
see
if
they
do
and
here
my
coat
oh
i
ca
take
it
penny
protested
you
need
it
yourself
no
i
sticking
here
at
my
post
quigley
answered
i
be
warm
enough
he
insisted
that
penny
wear
the
coat
she
left
the
station
and
waded
toward
higher
ground
the
coat
over
her
drenched
clothing
offered
only
slight
protection
from
the
chill
wind
with
the
sun
dropping
low
she
knew
that
soon
she
would
actually
suffer
from
cold
penny
wondered
where
to
start
in
gathering
vital
facts
for
her
father
the
flood
had
followed
the
narrow
valley
cutting
a
swath
of
destruction
above
delta
and
there
spreading
out
to
the
lowlands
she
decided
to
tour
the
outlying
section
of
delta
first
view
the
wreckage
and
question
survivors
if
only
salt
were
here
she
thought
dad
would
want
pictures
but
there
no
way
for
me
to
take
them
keeping
to
the
hillside
penny
reached
a
high
point
of
land
overlooking
what
had
been
the
town
of
delta
two
or
three
streets
remained
as
before
one
of
the
few
business
places
still
standing
was
the
big
white
stone
building
that
housed
the
local
telephone
company
elsewhere
there
was
only
water
and
scattered
debris
penny
headed
up
the
valley
passing
and
meeting
groups
of
bedraggled
refugees
who
had
taken
to
the
hills
at
the
first
alarm
she
questioned
everyone
nevertheless
definite
information
eluded
her
how
many
lives
had
been
lost
how
great
was
the
property
damage
what
fate
had
befallen
lear
and
the
burmasters
no
one
seemed
to
know
half
sick
with
despair
she
kept
on
she
jotted
down
names
and
facts
bibbs
an
old
man
who
ran
a
weekly
newspaper
at
delta
was
able
to
help
her
more
than
anyone
else
not
only
did
he
give
her
a
partial
list
of
the
known
missing
but
he
recited
many
other
facts
that
had
escaped
penny
a
million
thanks
she
began
gratefully
but
he
waved
her
into
silence
just
get
back
to
the
railroad
station
and
send
your
story
he
urged
penny
lost
all
count
of
time
as
she
retraced
her
way
along
the
muddy
hillside
everywhere
she
saw
suffering
and
destruction
her
mind
was
so
numbed
to
the
sight
that
she
recorded
impressions
automatically
it
was
long
after
nightfall
before
penny
reached
the
station
every
muscle
protested
as
she
dragged
herself
wearily
to
the
doorstep
during
her
absence
the
flood
had
lowered
by
nearly
a
foot
however
the
current
remained
swift
and
she
steadied
herself
for
a
moment
against
the
building
wall
who
there
called
quigley
sharply
penny
parker
okay
come
on
in
the
agent
invited
thought
you
might
be
a
looter
penny
pushed
open
the
door
the
waiting
room
was
filled
with
men
women
and
children
who
slumped
in
cold
misery
on
the
uncomfortable
row
of
seats
few
were
provided
with
any
warm
clothing
penny
splashed
through
the
dark
musty
room
to
the
inner
office
quigley
had
lighted
a
smoky
oil
lamp
which
revealed
that
he
had
made
himself
a
bed
on
top
of
the
telegraph
desk
i
turning
in
for
the
night
he
explained
there
nothing
more
we
can
do
until
morning
how
about
my
story
to
the
penny
asked
wearily
is
the
special
wire
set
up
yet
do
make
me
laugh
quigley
replied
the
dispatcher
wire
went
out
for
good
over
an
hour
ago
too
bad
you
killed
yourself
to
get
that
story
because
it
will
have
to
wait
but
it
must
wait
penny
protested
dad
counting
on
me
i
gave
my
promise
how
about
the
telephone
company
their
lines
are
all
down
western
union
it
the
same
with
them
repair
crews
are
on
their
way
here
but
it
will
take
time
the
valley
completely
cut
off
from
communication
for
how
long
listen
penny
you
know
as
much
about
it
as
i
do
the
airfields
are
under
water
how
about
the
roads
open
only
part
of
the
way
completely
discouraged
penny
sagged
into
a
chair
by
the
ticket
counter
she
was
wet
through
plastered
with
mud
hungry
and
tired
enough
to
collapse
after
all
of
her
work
and
suffering
her
efforts
had
been
in
vain
by
morning
experienced
city
reporters
and
photographers
would
swarm
into
the
valley
her
scoop
would
be
no
scoop
at
all
oh
brace
up
quigley
encouraged
carelessly
but
i
failed
dad
it
would
mean
a
lot
to
him
to
get
an
exclusive
story
of
this
disaster
i
gave
him
my
promise
i
send
the
facts
now
i
failed
it
not
your
fault
the
wire
could
be
set
up
quigley
tried
to
encourage
her
here
i
managed
to
get
ahold
of
a
blanket
for
you
wrap
up
in
it
and
grab
some
sleep
you
need
your
strength
tomorrow
i
guess
you
right
penny
acknowledged
gloomily
taking
off
the
muddy
boots
she
rolled
herself
into
the
warm
blanket
curling
up
into
the
chair
she
pillowed
her
head
on
the
desk
and
slept
the
untroubled
sleep
of
complete
exhaustion
chapter
a
toward
morning
penny
awoke
to
find
her
limbs
stiff
and
cramped
murky
fetid
water
still
flowed
over
the
floor
of
the
station
however
it
had
lowered
during
the
night
leaving
a
rim
of
oozy
mud
to
mark
the
office
walls
the
first
ray
of
light
streamed
through
the
broken
window
penny
yawned
and
stretched
her
cramped
feet
she
felt
wretched
and
dirty
her
clothing
was
stiff
and
caked
with
mud
she
scraped
off
what
she
could
and
washed
face
and
hands
in
a
basin
of
water
she
found
at
the
back
end
of
the
room
when
she
returned
joe
quigley
was
awake
my
neck
my
arm
my
whole
anatomy
he
complained
rubbing
a
hand
over
his
stubbly
beard
i
a
cripple
for
life
i
feel
the
same
way
penny
grinned
i
hungry
too
anything
to
eat
around
here
not
a
crumb
the
folks
out
in
the
waiting
room
broke
into
all
the
vending
machines
last
night
there
not
so
much
as
a
piece
of
candy
left
and
there
no
place
in
delta
where
food
can
be
bought
not
that
i
know
of
only
a
few
relief
kitchens
were
set
up
last
night
they
ca
begin
to
take
care
of
the
mob
penny
peered
out
into
the
crowded
waiting
room
mothers
with
babies
in
their
arms
had
sat
there
all
night
some
of
the
refugees
were
weeping
others
accepted
their
lot
with
stoical
calm
seeing
such
misery
penny
forgot
her
own
hunger
and
discomfort
do
you
think
help
will
come
soon
she
asked
quigley
hard
to
tell
he
replied
it
should
penny
went
out
into
the
waiting
room
but
there
was
very
little
she
could
do
to
help
the
unfortunate
sufferers
she
gave
one
of
the
women
her
blanket
that
was
foolish
of
you
quigley
told
her
a
moment
later
likely
need
it
yourself
i
rather
go
without
penny
replied
anyway
i
ca
bear
to
stay
here
any
longer
i
going
to
the
telephone
office
why
there
the
building
stands
high
and
should
be
one
of
the
first
places
to
reopen
penny
declared
hopefully
maybe
i
can
get
a
long
distance
call
through
to
dad
better
leave
some
of
your
story
with
me
advised
quigley
if
we
get
a
wire
before
the
telephone
company
does
i
try
to
send
it
for
you
penny
scribbled
a
hundred
word
message
packing
it
solidly
with
facts
if
ever
it
reached
riverview
a
rewrite
man
could
enlarge
it
to
at
least
a
column
saying
goodbye
to
joe
penny
made
her
way
toward
all
that
remained
of
delta
business
section
she
had
not
seen
louise
since
the
previous
afternoon
and
was
greatly
worried
about
her
i
know
she
safe
she
told
herself
but
i
must
find
her
penny
was
not
alone
on
the
devastated
streets
refugees
wandered
aimlessly
about
seeking
loved
ones
or
treasured
possessions
long
lines
of
shivering
people
waited
in
front
of
a
church
that
had
been
converted
into
a
soup
kitchen
penny
joined
the
line
just
as
a
woman
handed
her
a
steaming
cup
of
hot
broth
she
heard
her
name
spoken
turning
quickly
she
saw
louise
running
toward
her
from
across
the
street
penny
penny
her
chum
cried
joyfully
careful
penny
cautioned
balancing
the
cup
of
soup
this
broth
is
as
precious
as
gold
oh
you
poor
thing
cried
louise
hugging
her
convulsively
you
look
dreadful
that
because
i
so
hungry
penny
laughed
have
you
had
anything
to
eat
oh
yes
i
stayed
at
that
farmhouse
on
the
hill
last
night
i
actually
had
a
bed
to
sleep
in
and
a
good
hot
breakfast
this
morning
but
been
dreadfully
worried
about
you
and
that
goes
double
answered
penny
wait
until
i
gobble
this
soup
and
we
compare
notes
she
drank
the
broth
greedily
and
the
girls
walked
away
from
the
church
penny
then
told
of
her
experiences
since
leaving
her
chum
on
the
hillside
louise
was
much
relieved
to
learn
that
word
had
been
sent
to
riverview
of
their
safety
but
what
of
lear
and
the
burmasters
she
asked
anxiously
have
you
heard
what
happened
to
them
penny
shook
her
head
joe
quigley
thinks
they
did
have
a
chance
i
ca
comprehend
it
somehow
louise
said
with
a
shudder
it
just
does
seem
possible
why
we
were
guests
in
lear
home
less
than
hours
ago
i
know
agreed
penny
soberly
i
keep
hoping
that
somehow
they
escaped
if
only
we
could
learn
the
truth
there
not
a
chance
to
get
through
now
penny
said
slowly
the
water
gone
down
a
little
but
not
enough
if
we
had
a
boat
the
current
is
still
so
swift
we
could
handle
it
i
suppose
not
louise
admitted
hopelessly
when
do
you
suppose
the
relief
folks
will
get
here
they
should
be
moving
in
at
any
time
and
when
they
come
probably
be
trailed
by
a
flock
of
reporters
and
photographers
this
flood
will
be
a
big
story
louise
acknowledged
big
it
one
of
the
greatest
news
stories
of
the
year
and
here
i
am
helpless
to
send
out
a
single
word
of
copy
you
mean
that
folks
outside
of
the
valley
do
know
about
the
flood
louise
gasped
the
news
went
out
but
only
as
a
flash
before
we
could
give
any
details
our
only
wire
connection
was
lost
then
the
first
reporter
to
get
his
news
out
of
the
valley
will
have
a
big
story
that
the
size
of
it
penny
nodded
the
worst
of
it
is
that
depending
upon
me
but
he
ca
expect
you
to
do
the
impossible
if
there
are
no
wire
connections
it
not
your
fault
anyhow
as
soon
as
one
is
set
up
be
able
to
send
your
story
other
reporters
will
be
here
by
that
time
experienced
men
maybe
they
get
the
jump
on
me
i
venture
they
wo
louise
said
with
emphasis
you
never
failed
yet
on
a
story
this
is
more
than
a
story
lou
it
a
great
human
tragedy
somehow
i
do
feel
a
bit
like
a
reporter
i
just
feel
bewildered
and
rather
stunned
you
tired
and
half
sick
louise
said
she
linked
arms
with
penny
and
guided
her
away
from
the
long
line
of
refugees
where
to
she
asked
after
they
had
wandered
for
some
distance
i
was
starting
for
the
telephone
company
office
when
i
met
you
why
the
telephone
office
louise
asked
well
it
high
and
dry
i
thought
that
by
some
chance
they
might
have
a
wire
connection
then
let
go
there
by
all
means
urged
louise
farther
down
the
street
the
girls
came
to
the
telephone
company
offices
the
building
one
of
the
newest
and
tallest
in
delta
had
been
gutted
by
the
flood
however
the
upper
floors
remained
dry
and
emergency
quarters
had
been
established
there
nearly
all
employees
were
at
their
posts
penny
and
louise
pushed
their
way
through
the
throng
of
refugees
that
had
taken
possession
of
the
lower
floor
climbing
the
stairs
to
the
telephone
offices
they
asked
to
see
the
manager
nordwall
is
seeing
anyone
they
were
informed
he
very
busy
penny
persisted
she
explained
that
her
business
was
urgent
and
concerned
getting
a
news
story
through
to
riverview
after
a
long
delay
she
was
allowed
to
talk
to
the
manager
a
harassed
man
named
nordwall
please
state
your
case
briefly
he
said
wearily
penny
explained
again
that
she
wished
to
get
a
story
of
the
flood
through
to
her
father
paper
and
asked
what
hope
there
was
not
much
i
afraid
the
man
replied
we
have
a
single
toll
line
at
present
how
soon
do
you
expect
to
get
one
the
manager
hesitated
unwilling
to
commit
himself
by
noon
we
may
have
one
wire
west
he
said
reluctantly
penny
asked
if
she
could
have
first
chance
at
it
nordwall
regretfully
shook
his
head
relief
work
must
come
before
news
then
there
no
way
to
get
my
story
out
i
suggest
that
you
place
your
call
in
the
usual
way
nordwall
instructed
i
tell
our
long
distance
chief
operator
to
put
it
ahead
of
everything
except
relief
work
messages
penny
obeyed
the
manager
suggestion
however
she
and
louise
both
knew
that
there
was
slight
chance
the
call
would
go
through
in
time
to
do
any
good
no
use
waiting
around
here
penny
said
gloomily
the
wire
wo
even
be
set
up
before
noon
leaving
the
telephone
building
the
girls
sloshed
back
toward
the
railroad
suddenly
louise
drew
penny
attention
to
an
airplane
flying
low
overhead
it
flew
so
close
to
the
ground
that
they
could
read
united
press
on
the
wings
well
it
looks
as
if
the
news
boys
are
moving
in
penny
observed
probably
taking
photographs
of
the
flood
the
airplane
circled
delta
and
then
vanished
eastward
walking
on
the
girls
met
an
armed
soldier
who
passed
them
without
a
glance
the
national
guard
penny
commented
that
means
a
road
is
open
and
it
means
that
help
is
here
at
last
louise
cried
property
will
be
protected
now
and
some
order
will
be
established
penny
remained
silent
are
you
glad
louise
demanded
staring
at
her
companion
yes
i
glad
penny
said
slowly
i
truly
am
but
the
opening
of
the
road
means
that
within
a
very
little
while
every
news
service
in
the
country
will
have
men
here
and
you
lost
your
chance
to
send
an
exclusive
story
to
the
i
let
dad
down
penny
admitted
he
depended
upon
me
and
i
failed
him
dismally
chapter
line
to
penny
and
louise
trudged
slowly
on
toward
the
railroad
tracks
they
were
too
discouraged
for
much
conversation
and
avoided
speaking
of
lear
or
the
burmasters
sleepy
hollow
had
been
washed
away
but
no
one
could
tell
them
what
had
happened
to
the
unfortunate
ones
caught
in
the
valley
it
does
matter
now
penny
said
dispiritedly
but
i
know
who
masqueraded
as
the
headless
horseman
joe
quigley
the
station
agent
yes
he
told
me
about
it
last
night
of
course
lear
let
him
use
her
horse
and
no
doubt
she
encouraged
him
in
the
idea
they
did
it
to
plague
the
burmasters
joe
thought
he
could
bring
burmaster
around
to
his
way
of
thinking
about
the
huntley
dam
how
stupid
everyone
was
louise
sighed
if
it
had
been
for
burmaster
stubbornness
her
husband
might
have
given
the
money
to
save
the
dam
then
this
dreadful
disaster
would
have
been
prevented
penny
nodded
absently
her
gaze
was
fixed
upon
a
stout
man
just
ahead
who
wore
climbing
irons
on
his
heavy
shoes
she
nudged
louise
see
that
fellow
why
yes
what
about
him
i
sure
he
a
telephone
lineman
probably
he
working
on
the
line
by
the
railroad
probably
louise
agreed
without
much
interest
come
on
penny
urged
quickening
pace
let
talk
to
him
the
girls
overtook
the
workman
and
fell
into
step
penny
questioned
him
and
readily
learned
that
he
was
working
close
by
at
the
railroad
bridge
we
aiming
to
shoot
a
wire
across
the
river
the
man
volunteered
it
going
to
be
one
tough
little
job
mind
if
we
go
along
penny
asked
eagerly
it
okay
with
me
the
telephone
man
consented
hard
walking
though
flood
waters
had
receded
from
the
railroad
leaving
a
long
stretch
of
twisted
rails
and
slimey
they
waded
through
the
mud
soon
coming
to
the
break
where
the
bridge
had
swung
aside
debris
of
every
variety
had
piled
high
against
the
wrecked
steel
structure
flood
water
boiled
through
the
gap
at
a
furious
rate
i
do
see
how
they
ever
get
a
cable
across
there
penny
commented
dubiously
coast
guardsmen
are
helping
us
the
lineman
explained
they
shoot
it
over
with
a
lyle
gun
we
hope
penny
and
louise
wandered
toward
the
gap
in
the
roadbed
on
both
shores
linemen
and
cable
splicers
were
hard
at
work
coast
guardsmen
already
had
set
up
their
equipment
and
all
was
in
readiness
to
shoot
a
cable
across
the
river
okay
let
go
rang
out
the
terse
order
stand
clear
a
coast
guardsman
raised
the
lyle
gun
making
certain
that
the
steel
wire
would
run
free
he
released
the
trigger
the
weighted
cable
flashed
through
the
air
in
a
beautiful
arch
only
to
fall
short
of
its
goal
not
enough
allowance
for
the
wind
the
guardsman
said
in
disgust
we
need
a
heavier
charge
the
gun
was
reloaded
and
again
the
wire
spun
from
its
spool
again
it
fell
short
of
the
far
shore
by
three
feet
undaunted
by
failure
the
men
tried
once
more
this
time
the
aim
was
true
and
the
heavy
powder
charge
carried
rod
and
cable
to
its
mark
they
done
it
penny
cried
jubilantly
now
it
should
be
long
before
we
get
a
wire
connection
with
the
outside
world
immediately
telephone
company
men
seized
the
flexible
cable
anchoring
it
solidly
heavy
cables
then
were
drawn
across
and
made
fast
permitting
a
courageous
lineman
in
a
bosun
chair
to
work
high
above
the
turbulent
river
if
that
cable
should
break
he
be
lost
louise
said
with
a
shudder
it
makes
me
jumpy
to
watch
him
fearlessly
the
man
accomplished
his
task
suspending
a
temporary
emergency
telephone
line
cable
splicers
promptly
carried
the
ends
of
the
new
cable
to
terminal
boxes
so
absorbed
was
penny
in
watching
the
task
that
for
a
time
she
forgot
her
own
urgent
need
of
a
message
wire
but
as
she
observed
the
men
talking
over
a
test
phone
the
realization
suddenly
came
to
her
that
a
through
wire
had
been
established
west
from
red
valley
lou
they
done
it
she
exclaimed
the
wire
connection
is
made
it
does
look
that
way
if
only
i
could
use
that
test
set
to
get
my
news
story
through
to
dad
fat
chance
i
still
be
the
first
to
send
out
the
story
penny
went
on
excitedly
it
will
do
no
harm
to
ask
anyhow
breaking
away
from
louise
she
sought
the
lineman
of
her
acquaintance
eagerly
she
broached
her
request
not
a
chance
to
use
that
line
sister
he
answered
impatiently
our
are
for
testing
purposes
only
but
this
is
a
very
great
emergency
sorry
the
lineman
brought
her
up
short
you
have
to
put
your
call
through
the
regular
channels
regulations
baffled
by
the
cold
refusal
penny
turned
away
even
though
she
knew
the
telephone
man
had
no
authority
to
grant
her
request
she
was
none
the
less
annoyed
this
is
enough
to
drive
one
mad
she
complained
to
louise
it
may
be
hours
before
the
downtown
telephone
office
will
offer
toll
service
well
it
does
no
good
to
fret
about
it
her
chum
shrugged
nothing
you
can
do
i
not
so
sure
about
that
penny
muttered
her
attention
had
been
drawn
to
a
man
in
a
gray
business
suit
who
was
talking
earnestly
to
the
fireman
of
the
line
gang
that
mr
nordwall
she
announced
again
abandoning
louise
she
pushed
through
the
throng
of
spectators
touching
the
man
arm
to
attract
his
attention
she
said
breathlessly
nordwall
do
you
remember
me
he
gazed
at
her
without
recognition
i
penny
parker
i
want
to
get
a
message
through
to
my
father
oh
yes
now
i
remember
the
telephone
company
manager
exclaimed
you
trying
to
send
a
call
through
to
riverview
is
there
any
reason
why
i
ca
use
the
phone
now
the
test
instrument
such
a
procedure
would
be
very
irregular
but
it
would
save
hours
in
getting
my
story
through
penny
went
on
quickly
hundreds
of
persons
are
desperately
in
need
of
food
and
shelter
if
the
public
can
be
aroused
by
newspaper
publicity
funds
will
be
subscribed
generously
nordwall
you
must
let
me
send
my
story
this
is
a
very
great
emergency
the
manager
agreed
i
see
what
can
be
done
penny
waited
scarcely
daring
to
hope
however
nordwall
kept
his
word
to
the
delight
of
the
girls
the
call
was
put
through
within
ten
minutes
penny
was
summoned
to
the
test
box
you
have
your
connection
with
riverview
she
was
told
go
ahead
penny
raised
the
receiver
to
her
ear
her
hand
trembled
she
was
so
nervous
and
excited
she
spoke
tensely
into
the
transmitter
hello
is
this
the
office
anthony
parker
speaking
said
the
voice
of
her
father
dad
this
is
penny
i
have
the
story
for
you
she
heard
her
father
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
but
it
became
so
weak
she
could
not
distinguish
a
word
nor
could
he
understand
her
the
connection
had
failed
chapter
big
penny
despaired
fearing
that
she
never
could
make
her
father
understand
what
she
had
to
tell
him
then
unexpectedly
the
wire
trouble
cleared
and
parker
voice
fairly
boomed
in
her
ear
is
that
you
penny
are
you
all
right
oh
yes
dad
she
answered
eagerly
and
so
is
louise
we
have
the
story
for
you
could
get
it
out
before
thought
we
never
would
hear
from
you
again
parker
said
his
voice
vibrant
your
flash
on
the
flood
scooped
the
country
we
still
ahead
of
the
other
newspapers
shoot
me
all
the
facts
penny
talked
rapidly
but
distinctly
facts
had
been
imprinted
indelibly
on
her
memory
she
had
no
need
to
refer
to
notes
except
to
verify
names
now
and
then
parker
interrupted
to
ask
a
question
when
the
story
had
been
told
he
said
crisply
you
done
marvelously
penny
but
we
need
more
names
get
as
complete
a
list
of
the
missing
as
you
can
i
try
dad
and
pictures
so
far
all
we
have
are
a
few
airplane
shots
of
the
flooded
valley
can
you
get
ahold
of
a
camera
i
doubt
it
penny
said
dubiously
try
anyhow
her
father
urged
and
keep
on
the
lookout
for
salt
sommers
he
on
his
way
there
now
with
two
reporters
they
bringing
in
a
portable
wire
photo
set
then
you
plan
to
send
flood
pictures
direct
from
here
to
riverview
that
the
set
up
parker
replied
if
you
can
get
the
pictures
and
have
them
waiting
we
beat
every
other
paper
in
the
country
i
do
my
best
penny
promised
but
it
a
hard
assignment
she
talked
a
moment
longer
before
abandoning
the
test
to
one
of
the
linemen
seeking
louise
she
repeated
the
conversation
but
how
can
we
get
a
camera
her
chum
asked
hopelessly
delta
stores
are
under
water
most
of
them
at
least
though
the
situation
seemed
impossible
the
girls
tramped
from
one
street
to
another
after
an
hour
search
they
came
upon
a
man
who
was
snapping
pictures
with
a
box
camera
questioned
by
penny
he
agreed
to
part
with
it
for
twenty
dollars
i
have
that
many
cents
penny
admitted
but
my
father
is
owner
of
the
i
guarantee
that
you
receive
your
money
later
how
do
i
know
i
ever
see
you
again
you
do
said
penny
you
just
have
to
trust
me
you
look
honest
the
man
agreed
after
a
pause
i
take
a
chance
he
gave
penny
the
camera
together
with
three
rolls
of
film
the
girls
carefully
wrote
down
his
name
and
address
now
to
get
our
pictures
penny
said
as
she
and
louise
started
on
once
more
we
take
a
few
of
the
streets
then
i
want
to
get
some
shots
how
about
the
railroad
station
louise
suggested
a
great
many
of
the
refugees
are
being
cared
for
there
penny
nodded
assent
hastening
toward
the
depot
they
paused
several
times
to
snap
pictures
they
thought
were
especially
suitable
for
newspaper
reproduction
along
the
railroad
crews
of
men
were
hard
at
work
but
it
was
evident
that
it
would
be
days
before
train
service
could
be
resumed
penny
and
louise
went
into
the
crowded
waiting
room
of
the
depot
joe
quigley
had
locked
himself
into
the
inner
office
but
even
there
he
was
surrounded
by
a
group
of
argumentative
young
men
reporters
penny
observed
alertly
i
knew
it
would
take
them
long
to
get
here
the
newspaper
men
were
bombarding
quigley
with
questions
demanding
to
know
when
and
how
they
could
send
out
their
newspaper
copy
i
ca
help
you
boys
he
said
regretfully
it
will
be
two
hours
at
least
before
we
have
wire
service
better
try
the
telephone
company
just
then
one
of
the
newsmen
spied
penny
and
her
camera
immediately
he
hailed
her
the
other
reporters
flocked
about
the
two
girls
offering
to
buy
any
of
the
films
at
fancy
prices
sorry
penny
declined
my
pictures
are
earmarked
for
the
what
did
you
hear
one
of
the
men
bantered
their
wire
photo
car
broke
down
just
this
side
of
hobostein
the
wo
move
in
here
before
night
by
then
your
pictures
will
be
old
stuff
better
sell
to
us
urged
another
penny
shook
her
head
she
was
sure
whether
or
not
the
men
were
joking
in
any
case
she
meant
to
hold
her
pictures
until
her
father
released
them
between
hobostein
and
delta
there
was
only
one
highway
over
which
a
car
could
pass
the
arrival
of
newspaper
men
led
penny
to
believe
that
this
road
now
was
open
dad
told
me
to
keep
a
sharp
watch
for
salt
sommers
she
said
to
louise
let
post
ourselves
by
the
road
where
we
can
see
incoming
cars
what
about
the
pictures
we
planned
to
take
here
i
do
want
to
snap
one
or
two
penny
admitted
it
embarrassing
though
just
to
walk
up
to
a
group
and
ask
to
take
a
picture
as
the
girls
debated
the
door
swung
open
into
the
already
room
stumbled
a
new
group
of
refugees
suddenly
penny
gaze
fastened
upon
a
haggard
woman
who
looked
grotesque
in
a
man
overcoat
many
sizes
too
large
for
her
the
face
was
in
the
high
collar
and
she
could
not
see
it
plainly
then
the
woman
turned
and
penny
recognized
her
mrs
burmaster
she
cried
the
woman
stared
at
the
two
girls
with
leaden
eyes
she
did
not
seem
to
recognize
them
oh
we
so
glad
you
safe
penny
cried
rushing
to
her
your
husband
burmaster
lips
moved
but
no
sound
came
she
seemed
stunned
by
what
she
had
gone
through
do
you
know
what
happened
to
mrs
lear
penny
asked
anxiously
have
you
heard
even
then
burmaster
did
not
speak
but
a
strange
light
came
into
her
eyes
tell
me
penny
urged
please
her
words
seemed
to
penetrate
the
befogged
mind
of
the
dazed
woman
burmaster
lips
moved
slightly
penny
bent
closer
to
hear
lear
is
dead
the
woman
whispered
she
was
drowned
when
she
saved
me
chapter
the
information
shocked
penny
lear
dead
she
repeated
oh
i
was
hoping
that
somehow
she
escaped
she
would
have
if
it
had
been
for
me
burmaster
said
dully
ten
minutes
before
the
dam
gave
way
a
telephone
warning
was
sent
out
lear
thought
my
husband
and
i
might
not
have
heard
it
she
rode
her
horse
to
sleepy
hollow
intending
to
warn
us
and
then
what
happened
just
as
lear
reached
our
place
the
wall
of
water
came
roaring
down
the
valley
we
all
ran
out
of
the
house
hoping
to
reach
the
hills
we
did
get
to
higher
ground
but
we
saw
we
could
make
it
lear
made
my
husband
and
me
climb
into
a
tree
before
she
could
follow
us
the
water
came
lear
was
swept
away
yes
we
saw
her
struggling
and
then
the
water
carried
her
beyond
sight
burmaster
covered
her
face
oh
it
was
horrible
and
to
think
that
it
was
all
my
fault
where
is
your
husband
now
penny
inquired
kindly
outside
i
think
burmaster
murmured
we
were
brought
here
together
in
a
boat
penny
and
louise
went
outdoors
and
after
a
brief
search
found
burmaster
his
clothing
was
caked
with
mud
his
face
was
unshaven
and
he
looked
years
older
to
his
wife
story
he
could
add
little
this
has
been
a
dreadful
shock
he
told
penny
now
that
it
too
late
i
realize
what
a
stubborn
fool
i
was
my
wife
and
i
are
responsible
for
lear
death
no
no
you
must
say
that
penny
tried
to
comfort
him
it
was
impossible
for
anyone
to
predict
what
would
happen
sleepy
hollow
is
gone
completely
washed
away
burmaster
went
on
bitterly
the
estate
cost
me
a
fortune
but
you
can
rebuild
i
never
shall
my
wife
never
could
be
happy
in
red
valley
now
that
this
terrible
thing
has
occurred
it
would
be
intolerable
to
remain
i
been
thinking
matters
over
i
decided
to
deed
all
the
land
i
bought
back
to
the
valley
folk
it
the
least
i
can
do
to
right
a
great
wrong
it
would
be
very
generous
of
you
said
penny
her
eyes
shining
the
girls
talked
with
burmaster
for
a
little
while
and
then
started
toward
us
highway
intending
to
watch
incoming
cars
ambulances
army
and
supply
trucks
now
were
flowing
into
delta
in
a
steady
stream
however
midway
there
they
spied
a
car
coming
toward
them
which
bore
on
its
windshield
there
salt
now
penny
cried
signaling
frantically
the
car
stopped
with
a
jerk
the
photographer
sat
behind
the
wheel
while
beside
him
were
two
men
from
the
paper
news
department
well
well
salt
greeted
the
girls
jovially
he
swung
open
the
car
door
if
it
is
penny
the
child
wonder
meet
roy
daniels
and
joe
wiley
acknowledging
the
introduction
penny
and
louise
squeezed
into
the
front
seat
of
the
sedan
driving
on
salt
plied
them
with
questions
penny
told
him
how
rival
newsmen
had
tried
to
buy
her
camera
pictures
good
for
you
hanging
onto
them
salt
approved
warmly
our
car
never
did
break
down
by
the
way
where
can
we
set
up
our
portable
wire
photo
equipment
there
only
one
possibility
the
telephone
company
right
now
they
have
the
only
wire
service
in
delta
penny
directed
salt
through
the
few
streets
that
were
clear
of
debris
to
the
telephone
building
there
the
portable
wire
photo
equipment
quickly
was
set
up
penny
camera
pictures
were
developed
and
though
some
of
the
shots
were
there
were
four
good
enough
to
send
over
the
network
nordwall
has
six
toll
lines
out
of
delta
now
salt
told
the
girls
jubilantly
he
letting
us
have
one
of
them
carefully
the
photographer
tested
the
controls
of
the
wire
photo
machine
he
listened
briefly
to
the
hum
of
the
motor
satisfied
that
everything
was
running
properly
he
attached
one
of
the
freshly
printed
pictures
to
the
transmitting
cylinder
okay
he
signaled
to
nordwall
give
us
a
toll
to
the
within
a
few
minutes
the
order
came
network
clear
go
ahead
delta
salt
turned
on
a
switch
and
the
sending
cylinder
began
to
revolve
one
by
one
penny
pictures
were
transmitted
over
the
wire
your
shots
are
the
first
to
get
out
of
red
valley
salt
told
her
triumphantly
your
work
done
now
better
crawl
off
somewhere
and
sleep
penny
nodded
wearily
she
was
glad
to
know
that
the
would
scoop
every
other
paper
in
the
country
on
the
flood
story
and
pictures
still
for
some
reason
she
could
feel
very
happy
about
it
as
she
turned
away
salt
called
hey
wait
your
father
on
the
wire
photo
phone
he
wants
to
talk
to
you
penny
caught
up
the
receiver
eagerly
that
you
penny
a
blurred
voice
asked
in
her
ear
congratulations
you
came
through
with
flying
colors
guess
i
was
lucky
to
come
through
at
all
penny
said
slowly
some
were
so
fortunate
just
now
the
important
thing
is
when
are
you
coming
home
parker
asked
can
you
get
here
today
to
penny
the
thought
of
home
and
a
soft
bed
was
more
alluring
than
any
other
earthly
bliss
i
certainly
try
dad
she
promised
yes
somehow
i
get
there
after
penny
ended
the
conversation
with
her
father
she
and
louise
talked
to
salt
about
the
prospects
of
a
trip
home
regretfully
he
explained
that
with
a
big
story
to
cover
he
probably
would
not
be
leaving
that
day
but
there
are
plenty
of
cars
going
out
of
here
he
encouraged
them
why
not
go
down
to
the
depot
and
make
inquiries
the
idea
seemed
an
excellent
one
at
the
station
the
girls
talked
again
with
joe
quigley
who
assured
them
he
knew
of
a
car
that
was
leaving
very
shortly
hurry
out
to
highway
and
i
think
you
can
catch
the
fellow
he
urged
hastily
saying
goodbye
not
only
to
joe
but
to
and
burmaster
who
remained
in
the
crowded
station
the
girls
went
outside
as
they
rounded
a
corner
of
the
building
a
voice
fairly
boomed
at
them
hello
folks
penny
and
louise
whirled
around
to
see
silas
malcom
coming
toward
them
clinging
to
his
arm
was
a
spry
little
woman
in
a
borrowed
coat
and
hat
mrs
lear
gasped
the
girls
in
one
voice
it
takes
more
than
a
flood
to
wash
me
away
chirped
the
old
lady
bright
as
a
cricket
penny
and
louise
rushed
to
embrace
her
eagerly
they
plied
her
with
questions
i
jest
like
a
cat
with
nine
lives
old
lear
chuckled
when
the
flood
carried
me
off
i
did
give
up
not
me
i
was
a
purty
good
swimmer
as
a
gal
and
i
ai
so
bad
even
now
i
kinda
went
with
the
current
until
i
got
ahold
of
a
log
there
i
clung
until
a
red
cross
boat
picked
me
up
lear
safe
arrival
at
delta
thrilled
penny
and
louise
they
rushed
into
the
station
to
bring
and
burmaster
who
shared
their
great
relief
over
the
rescue
and
penny
was
delighted
when
burmaster
repeated
to
the
old
lady
what
he
had
told
her
