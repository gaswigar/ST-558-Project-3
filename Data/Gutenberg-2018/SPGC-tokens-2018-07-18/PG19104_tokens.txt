which
we
seldom
mention
in
this
house
i
mean
the
secret
societies
it
is
useless
to
deny
because
it
is
impossible
to
conceal
that
a
great
part
of
europe
the
whole
of
italy
and
france
and
a
great
portion
of
germany
to
say
nothing
of
other
countries
is
covered
with
a
network
of
these
secret
societies
just
as
the
superficies
of
the
earth
is
now
being
covered
with
railroads
and
what
are
their
objects
they
do
not
attempt
to
conceal
them
they
do
not
want
constitutional
government
they
do
not
want
ameliorated
institutions
they
want
to
change
the
tenure
of
land
to
drive
out
the
present
owners
of
the

and
to
put

end

preface
it
is
a
matter
of
some
regret
to
me
that
i
have
been
so
far
unable
to
continue
the
series
of
studies
on
the
french
revolution
of
which
chevalier
de
and
french
revolution
a
study
in
formed
the
first
two
volumes
but
the
state
of
the
world
at
the
end
of
the
great
war
seemed
to
demand
an
enquiry
into
the
present
phase
of
the
revolutionary
movement
hence
my
attempt
to
follow
its
course
up
to
modern
times
in
and
now
before
returning
to
that
first
cataclysm
i
have
felt
impelled
to
devote
one
more
book
to
the
revolution
as
a
whole
by
going
this
time
further
back
into
the
past
and
attempting
to
trace
its
origins
from
the
first
century
of
the
christian
era
for
it
is
only
by
taking
a
general
survey
of
the
movement
that
it
is
possible
to
understand
the
causes
of
any
particular
phase
of
its
existence
the
french
revolution
did
not
arise
merely
out
of
conditions
or
ideas
peculiar
to
the
eighteenth
century
nor
the
bolshevist
revolution
out
of
political
and
social
conditions
in
russia
or
the
teaching
of
karl
marx
both
these
explosions
were
produced
by
forces
which
making
use
of
popular
suffering
and
discontent
had
long
been
gathering
strength
for
an
onslaught
not
only
on
christianity
but
on
all
social
and
moral
order
it
is
of
immense
significance
to
notice
with
what
resentment
this
point
of
view
is
met
in
certain
quarters
when
i
first
began
to
write
on
revolution
a
london
publisher
said
to
me
remember
that
if
you
take
an
line
you
will
have
the
whole
literary
world
against
you
this
appeared
to
me
extraordinary
why
should
the
literary
world
sympathize
with
a
movement
which
from
the
french
revolution
onwards
has
always
been
directed
against
literature
art
and
science
and
has
openly
proclaimed
its
aim
to
exalt
the
manual
workers
over
the
intelligentsia
writers
must
be
proscribed
as
the
most
dangerous
enemies
of
the
people
said
robespierre
his
colleague
dumas
said
all
clever
men
should
be
guillotined
the
system
of
persecution
against
men
of
talents
was
organized
they
cried
out
in
the
sections
of
paris
of
that
man
for
he
has
written
a
book
precisely
the
same
policy
has
been
followed
in
russia
under
moderate
socialism
in
germany
the
professors
not
the
people
are
starving
in
garrets
yet
the
whole
press
of
our
country
is
permeated
with
subversive
influences
not
merely
in
partisan
works
but
in
manuals
of
history
or
literature
for
use
in
schools
burke
is
reproached
for
warning
us
against
the
french
revolution
and
carlyle
panegyric
is
applauded
and
whilst
every
slip
on
the
part
of
an
writer
is
seized
on
by
the
critics
and
held
up
as
an
example
of
the
whole
the
most
glaring
errors
not
only
of
conclusions
but
of
facts
pass
unchallenged
if
they
happen
to
be
committed
by
a
partisan
of
the
movement
the
principle
laid
down
by
collot
still
holds
good
tout
est
permis
pour
quiconque
agit
dans
le
sens
de
la
révolution
all
this
was
unknown
to
me
when
i
first
embarked
on
my
work
i
knew
that
french
writers
of
the
past
had
distorted
facts
to
suit
their
own
political
views
that
a
conspiracy
of
history
is
still
directed
by
certain
influences
in
the
masonic
lodges
and
the
sorbonne
i
did
not
know
that
this
conspiracy
was
being
carried
on
in
this
country
therefore
the
publisher
warning
did
not
daunt
me
if
i
was
wrong
either
in
my
conclusions
or
facts
i
was
prepared
to
be
challenged
should
not
years
of
laborious
historical
research
meet
either
with
recognition
or
with
reasoned
and
scholarly
refutation
but
although
my
book
received
a
great
many
generous
and
appreciative
reviews
in
the
press
criticisms
which
were
hostile
took
a
form
which
i
had
never
anticipated
not
a
single
honest
attempt
was
made
to
refute
either
my
or
by
the
usual
methods
of
controversy
statements
founded
on
documentary
evidence
were
met
with
flat
contradiction
unsupported
by
a
shred
of
counter
evidence
in
general
the
plan
adopted
was
not
to
disprove
but
to
discredit
by
means
of
flagrant
misquotations
by
attributing
to
me
views
i
had
never
expressed
or
even
by
means
of
offensive
personalities
it
will
surely
be
admitted
that
this
method
of
attack
is
unparalleled
in
any
other
sphere
of
literary
controversy
it
is
interesting
to
notice
that
precisely
the
same
line
was
adopted
a
hundred
years
ago
with
regard
to
professor
robison
and
the
abbé
barruel
whose
works
on
the
secret
causes
of
the
french
revolution
created
an
immense
sensation
in
their
day
the
legitimate
criticisms
that
might
have
been
made
on
their
work
find
no
place
in
the
diatribes
levelled
against
them
their
enemies
content
themselves
merely
with
calumnies
and
abuse
a
contemporary
american
writer
seth
payson
thus
describes
the
methods
employed
to
discredit
them
the
testimony
of
professor
robison
and
abbé
barruel
would
doubtless
have
been
considered
as
ample
in
any
case
which
did
not
interest
the
prejudices
and
passions
of
men
against
them
the
scurrility
and
odium
with
which
they
have
been
loaded
is
perfectly
natural
and
what
the
nature
of
their
testimony
would
have
led
one
to
expect
men
will
endeavour
to
invalidate
that
evidence
which
tends
to
unveil
their
dark
designs
and
it
can
not
be
expected
that
those
who
believe
that
the
end
sanctifies
the
means
will
be
very
scrupulous
as
to
their
measures
certainly
he
was
not
who
invented
the
following
character
and
arbitrarily
applied
it
to
robison
which
might
have
been
applied
with
as
much
propriety
to
any
other
person
in
europe
or
america
the
character
here
referred
to
is
taken
from
the
american
printed
at
hartford
september
by
babcock
in
this
paper
on
the
pretended
authority
of
professor
ebeling
we
are
told
that
robison
had
lived
too
fast
for
his
income
and
to
supply
deficiencies
had
undertaken
to
alter
a
bank
bill
that
he
was
detected
and
fled
to
france
that
having
been
expelled
the
lodge
in
edinburgh
he
applied
in
france
for
the
second
grade
but
was
refused
that
he
made
the
same
attempt
in
germany
and
afterwards
in
russia
but
never
succeeded
and
from
this
entertained
the
bitterest
hatred
to
masonry
and
after
wandering
about
europe
for
two
years
by
writing
to
secretary
dundas
and
presenting
a
copy
of
his
book
which
it
was
judged
would
answer
certain
purposes
of
the
ministry
the
prosecution
against
him
was
stopped
the
professor
returned
in
triumph
to
his
country
and
now
lives
upon
a
handsome
pension
instead
of
suffering
the
fate
of
his
predecessor
dodd
payson
goes
on
to
quote
a
writer
in
national
of
january
who
styles
himself
a
friend
to
truth
and
speaks
of
professor
robison
as
a
man
distinguished
by
abject
dependence
on
a
party
by
the
base
crimes
of
forgery
and
adultery
and
by
frequent
paroxysms
of
insanity
mounier
goes
further
still
and
in
his
pamphlet
attribuée
aux
philosophes
et
inspired
by
the
illuminatus
bode
quotes
a
story
that
robison
suffered
from
a
form
of
insanity
which
consisted
in
his
believing
that
the
posterior
portion
of
his
body
was
made
of
glass
in
support
of
all
this
farrago
of
nonsense
there
is
of
course
no
foundation
of
truth
robison
was
a
savant
who
lived
sane
and
respected
to
the
end
of
his
days
on
his
death
watt
wrote
of
him
he
was
a
man
of
the
clearest
head
and
the
most
science
of
anybody
i
have
ever
known
john
playfair
in
a
paper
read
before
the
royal
society
of
edinburgh
in
whilst
criticizing
his
of
a
though
at
the
same
time
admitting
he
had
himself
never
had
access
to
the
documents
robison
had
consulted
paid
the
following
tribute
to
his
character
and
erudition
his
range
in
science
was
most
extensive
he
was
familiar
with
the
whole
circle
of
the
accurate
sciences
nothing
can
add
to
the
esteem
which
they
those
who
were
personally
acquainted
with
him
felt
for
his
talents
and
worth
or
to
the
respect
in
which
they
now
hold
his
memory
nevertheless
the
lies
circulated
against
both
robison
and
barruel
were
not
without
effect
thirteen
years
later
we
find
another
american
this
time
a
freemason
confessing
with
shame
and
grief
and
indignation
that
he
had
been
carried
away
by
the
flood
of
vituperation
poured
upon
barruel
and
robison
during
the
past
thirty
years
that
the
title
pages
of
their
works
were
fearful
to
him
and
that
although
wishing
calmly
and
candidly
to
investigate
the
character
of
freemasonry
he
refused
for
months
to
open
their
books
yet
when
in
he
read
them
for
the
first
time
he
was
astonished
to
find
that
they
showed
a
manifest
tendency
towards
freemasonry
both
barruel
and
robison
he
now
realized
were
learned
men
candid
men
lovers
of
their
country
who
had
a
reverence
for
truth
and
religion
they
give
the
reasons
for
their
opinions
they
quote
their
authorities
naming
the
author
and
page
like
honest
people
they
both
had
a
wish
to
rescue
british
masonry
from
the
condemnation
and
fellowship
of
continental
masonry
and
appear
to
be
sincerely
actuated
by
the
desire
of
doing
good
by
giving
their
labours
to
the
public
that
the
author
was
right
here
in
his
description
of
barruel
attitude
to
freemasonry
is
shown
by
barruel
own
words
on
the
subject
england
above
all
is
full
of
those
upright
men
excellent
citizens
men
of
every
kind
and
in
every
condition
of
life
who
count
it
an
honour
to
be
masons
and
who
are
distinguished
from
other
men
only
by
ties
which
seem
to
strengthen
those
of
benevolence
and
fraternal
charity
it
is
not
the
fear
of
offending
a
nation
amongst
which
i
have
found
a
refuge
which
prompts
me
to
make
this
exception
gratitude
would
prevail
with
me
over
all
such
terrors
and
i
should
say
in
the
midst
of
london
england
is
lost
she
will
not
escape
the
french
revolution
if
the
masonic
lodges
resemble
those
i
have
to
unveil
i
would
even
say
more
government
and
all
christianity
would
long
ago
have
been
lost
in
england
if
one
could
suppose
its
freemasons
to
be
initiated
into
the
last
mysteries
of
the
sect
in
another
passage
barruel
observes
that
masonry
in
england
is
a
society
composed
of
good
citizens
in
general
whose
chief
object
is
to
help
each
other
by
principles
of
equality
which
for
them
is
nothing
else
but
universal
fraternity
and
again
let
us
admire
it
the
wisdom
of
england
for
having
known
how
to
make
a
real
source
of
benefit
to
the
state
out
of
those
same
mysteries
which
elsewhere
conceal
a
profound
conspiracy
against
the
state
and
religion
the
only
criticism
british
freemasons
may
make
on
this
verdict
is
that
barruel
regards
masonry
as
a
system
which
originally
contained
an
element
of
danger
that
has
been
eliminated
in
england
whilst
they
regard
it
as
a
system
originally
innocuous
into
which
a
dangerous
element
was
inserted
on
the
continent
thus
according
to
the
former
conception
freemasonry
might
be
compared
to
one
of
the
brass
brought
back
from
the
of
france
and
converted
into
a
holder
whilst
according
to
the
latter
it
resembles
an
innocent
brass
holder
which
has
been
used
as
a
receptacle
for
explosives
the
fact
is
that
as
i
shall
endeavour
to
show
in
the
course
of
this
book
freemasonry
being
a
composite
system
there
is
some
justification
for
both
these
theories
in
either
case
it
will
be
seen
that
continental
masonry
alone
stands
condemned
the
plan
of
representing
robison
and
barruel
as
the
enemies
of
british
masonry
can
therefore
only
be
regarded
as
a
method
for
discrediting
them
in
the
eyes
of
british
freemasons
and
consequently
for
bringing
the
latter
over
to
the
side
of
their
antagonists
exactly
the
same
method
of
attack
has
been
directed
against
those
of
us
who
during
the
last
few
years
have
attempted
to
warn
the
world
of
the
secret
forces
working
to
destroy
civilization
in
my
own
case
even
the
plan
of
accusing
me
of
having
attacked
british
masonry
has
been
adopted
without
the
shadow
of
a
foundation
from
the
beginning
i
have
always
differentiated
between
british
and
grand
orient
masonry
and
have
numbered
high
british
masons
amongst
my
friends
but
what
is
the
main
charge
brought
against
us
like
robison
and
barruel
we
are
accused
of
raising
a
false
alarm
of
creating
a
bogey
or
of
being
the
victims
of
an
obsession
up
to
a
point
this
is
comprehensible
whilst
on
the
continent
the
importance
of
secret
societies
is
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
and
the
libraries
of
foreign
capitals
teem
with
books
on
the
question
people
in
this
country
really
imagine
that
secret
societies
are
things
of
the
past
articles
to
this
effect
appeared
quite
recently
in
two
leading
london
newspapers
whilst
practically
nothing
of
any
value
has
been
written
about
them
in
our
language
during
the
last
hundred
years
hence
ideas
that
are
commonplaces
on
the
continent
here
appear
sensational
and
extravagant
the
mind
of
the
englishman
does
not
readily
accept
anything
he
can
not
see
or
even
sometimes
anything
he
can
see
which
is
unprecedented
in
his
experience
so
that
like
the
west
american
farmer
confronted
for
the
first
time
by
the
sight
of
a
giraffe
his
impulse
is
to
cry
out
angrily
i
do
believe
it
but
whilst
making
all
allowance
for
honest
ignorance
and
incredulity
it
is
impossible
not
to
recognize
a
certain
method
in
the
manner
in
which
the
cry
of
obsession
or
bogey
is
raised
for
it
will
be
noticed
that
people
who
specialize
on
other
subjects
are
not
described
as
obsessed
we
did
not
hear
for
example
that
the
late
professor
einstein
had
relativity
on
the
brain
because
he
wrote
and
lectured
exclusively
on
this
question
nor
do
we
hear
it
suggested
that
howard
carter
is
obsessed
with
the
idea
of
tutankhamen
and
that
it
would
be
well
if
he
were
to
set
out
for
the
south
pole
by
way
of
a
change
again
all
those
who
warn
the
world
concerning
eventualities
they
conceive
to
be
a
danger
are
not
accused
of
creating
bogeys
thus
although
lord
roberts
was
denounced
as
a
scaremonger
for
urging
the
country
to
prepare
for
defence
against
a
design
openly
avowed
by
germany
both
in
speech
and
print
and
in
the
duke
of
northumberland
was
declared
the
victim
of
a
delusion
for
believing
in
the
existence
of
a
plot
against
the
british
empire
which
had
been
proclaimed
in
a
thousand
revolutionary
harangues
and
pamphlets
people
who
without
bothering
to
produce
a
shred
of
documentary
evidence
had
sounded
the
alarm
on
the
menace
of
french
imperialism
and
asserted
that
our
former
allies
were
engaged
in
building
a
vast
fleet
of
aeroplanes
in
order
to
attack
our
coasts
they
were
not
held
to
be
either
scaremongers
or
insane
on
the
contrary
although
some
of
these
same
people
were
proved
by
events
to
have
been
completely
wrong
in
their
prognostications
at
the
beginning
of
the
great
war
they
are
still
regarded
as
oracles
and
sometimes
even
described
as
thinking
for
half
europe
another
instance
of
this
kind
may
be
cited
in
the
case
of
john
spargo
author
of
a
small
book
entitled
jew
and
american
on
page
of
this
work
spargo
in
refuting
the
accusations
brought
against
the
jews
observes
belief
in
widespread
conspiracies
directed
against
individuals
or
the
state
is
probably
the
commonest
form
assumed
by
the
human
mind
when
it
loses
its
balance
and
its
sense
of
proportion
yet
on
page
spargo
declares
that
when
visiting
this
country
in
september
and
october
i
found
in
england
great
organizations
obviously
well
financed
devoted
to
the
sinister
purpose
of
creating
feeling
and
sentiment
i
found
special
articles
in
influential
newspapers
devoted
to
the
same
evil
purpose
i
found
at
at
least
one
journal
obviously
well
financed
again
exclusively
devoted
to
the
fostering
of
suspicion
fear
and
hatred
against
the
jew
and
in
the
bookstores
i
discovered
a
whole
library
of
books
devoted
to
the
same
end
it
will
be
seen
then
that
a
belief
in
widespread
conspiracies
is
not
always
to
be
regarded
as
a
sign
of
loss
of
mental
balance
even
when
these
conspiracies
remain
completely
invisible
to
the
general
public
for
those
of
us
who
were
in
london
during
the
period
of
visit
saw
nothing
of
the
things
he
here
describes
where
we
ask
were
these
great
organizations
striving
to
create
sentiments
what
were
their
names
by
whom
were
they
led
it
is
true
however
that
there
were
organizations
in
existence
here
at
this
date
instituted
for
the
purpose
of
combating
bolshevism
is
then
synonymous
with
this
is
the
conclusion
to
which
one
is
inevitably
led
for
it
will
be
noticed
that
anyone
who
attempts
to
expose
the
secret
forces
behind
the
revolutionary
movement
whether
he
mentions
jews
in
this
connexion
or
even
if
he
goes
out
of
his
way
to
exonerate
them
will
incur
the
hostility
of
the
jews
and
their
friends
and
will
still
be
described
as
the
realization
of
this
fact
has
led
me
particularly
to
include
the
jews
in
the
study
of
secret
societies
the
object
of
the
present
book
is
therefore
to
carry
further
the
enquiry
i
began
in
by
tracing
the
course
of
revolutionary
ideas
through
secret
societies
from
the
earliest
times
indicating
the
rôle
of
the
jews
only
where
it
is
to
be
clearly
detected
but
not
seeking
to
implicate
them
where
good
evidence
is
not
forthcoming
for
this
reason
i
shall
not
base
assertions
on
merely
works
but
principally
on
the
writings
of
the
jews
themselves
in
the
same
way
with
regard
to
secret
societies
i
shall
rely
as
far
as
possible
on
the
documents
and
admissions
of
their
members
on
which
point
i
have
been
able
to
collect
a
great
deal
of
fresh
data
entirely
corroborating
my
former
thesis
it
should
be
understood
that
i
do
not
propose
to
give
a
complete
history
of
secret
societies
but
only
of
secret
societies
in
their
relation
to
the
revolutionary
movement
i
shall
therefore
not
attempt
to
describe
the
theories
of
occultism
nor
to
enquire
into
the
secrets
of
freemasonry
but
simply
to
relate
the
history
of
these
systems
in
order
to
show
the
manner
in
which
they
have
been
utilized
for
a
subversive
purpose
if
i
then
fail
to
convince
the
incredulous
that
secret
forces
of
revolution
exist
it
will
not
be
for
want
of
evidence

i
the
ancient
secret
tradition
the
east
is
the
cradle
of
secret
societies
for
whatever
end
they
may
have
been
employed
the
inspiration
and
methods
of
most
of
those
mysterious
associations
which
have
played
so
important
a
part
behind
the
scenes
of
the
world
history
will
be
found
to
have
emanated
from
the
lands
where
the
first
recorded
acts
of
the
great
human
drama
were
played
out
egypt
babylon
syria
and
persia
on
the
one
hand
eastern
mysticism
on
the
other
oriental
love
of
intrigue
framed
the
systems
later
on
to
be
transported
to
the
west
with
results
so
tremendous
and
in
the
study
of
secret
societies
we
have
then
a
double
line
to
follow
the
course
of
associations
enveloping
themselves
in
secrecy
for
the
pursuit
of
esoteric
knowledge
and
those
using
mystery
and
secrecy
for
an
ulterior
and
usually
a
political
purpose
but
esotericism
again
presents
a
dual
aspect
here
as
in
every
phase
of
earthly
life
there
is
the
de
la
white
and
black
light
and
darkness
the
heaven
and
hell
of
the
human
mind
the
quest
for
hidden
knowledge
may
end
with
initiation
into
divine
truths
or
into
dark
and
abominable
cults
who
knows
with
what
forces
he
may
be
brought
in
contact
beyond
the
veil
initiation
which
leads
to
making
use
of
spiritual
forces
whether
good
or
evil
is
therefore
capable
of
raising
man
to
greater
heights
or
of
degrading
him
to
lower
depths
than
he
could
ever
have
reached
by
remaining
on
the
purely
physical
plane
and
when
men
thus
unite
themselves
in
associations
a
collective
force
is
generated
which
may
exercise
immense
influence
over
the
world
around
hence
the
importance
of
secret
societies
let
it
be
said
once
and
for
all
secret
societies
have
not
always
been
formed
for
evil
purposes
on
the
contrary
many
have
arisen
from
the
highest
aspirations
of
the
human
mind
the
desire
for
a
knowledge
of
eternal
verities
the
evil
arising
from
such
systems
has
usually
consisted
in
the
perversion
of
principles
that
once
were
pure
and
holy
if
i
do
not
insist
further
on
this
point
it
is
because
a
vast
literature
has
already
been
devoted
to
the
subject
so
that
it
need
only
be
touched
on
briefly
here
now
from
the
earliest
times
groups
of
initiates
or
wise
men
have
existed
claiming
to
be
in
possession
of
esoteric
doctrines
known
as
the
mysteries
incapable
of
apprehension
by
the
vulgar
and
relating
to
the
origin
and
end
of
man
the
life
of
the
soul
after
death
and
the
nature
of
god
or
the
gods
it
is
this
exclusive
attitude
which
constitutes
the
essential
difference
between
the
initiates
of
the
ancient
world
and
the
great
teachers
of
religion
with
whom
modern
occultists
seek
to
confound
them
for
whilst
religious
leaders
such
as
buddha
and
mohammed
sought
for
divine
knowledge
in
order
that
they
might
impart
it
to
the
world
the
initiates
believed
that
sacred
mysteries
should
not
be
revealed
to
the
profane
but
should
remain
exclusively
in
their
own
keeping
although
the
desire
for
initiation
might
spring
from
the
highest
aspiration
the
gratification
whether
real
or
imaginary
of
this
desire
often
led
to
spiritual
arrogance
and
abominable
tyranny
resulting
in
the
fearful
trials
the
tortures
physical
and
mental
ending
even
at
times
in
death
to
which
the
neophyte
was
subjected
by
his
superiors
the
mysteries
according
to
a
theory
current
in
occult
and
masonic
circles
certain
ideas
were
common
to
all
the
more
important
mysteries
thus
forming
a
continuous
tradition
handed
down
through
succeeding
groups
of
initiates
of
different
ages
and
countries
amongst
these
ideas
is
said
to
have
been
the
conception
of
the
unity
of
god
whilst
to
the
multitude
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
preach
polytheism
since
only
in
this
manner
could
the
plural
aspects
of
the
divine
be
apprehended
by
the
multitude
the
initiates
themselves
believed
in
the
existence
of
one
supreme
being
the
creator
of
the
universe
pervading
and
governing
all
things
le
plongeon
whose
object
is
to
show
an
affinity
between
the
sacred
mysteries
of
the
mayas
and
of
the
egyptians
chaldeans
and
greeks
asserts
that
the
idea
of
a
sole
and
omnipotent
deity
who
created
all
things
seems
to
have
been
the
universal
belief
in
early
ages
amongst
all
the
nations
that
had
reached
a
high
degree
of
civilization
this
was
the
doctrine
of
the
egyptian
priests
the
same
writer
goes
on
to
say
that
the
doctrine
of
a
supreme
deity
composed
of
three
parts
distinct
from
each
other
yet
forming
one
was
universally
prevalent
among
the
civilized
nations
of
america
asia
and
the
egyptians
and
that
the
priests
and
learned
men
of
egypt
chaldea
india
or
china
kept
it
a
profound
secret
and
imparted
it
only
to
a
few
select
among
those
initiated
in
the
sacred
mysteries
this
view
has
been
expressed
by
many
other
writers
yet
lacks
historical
proof
that
monotheism
existed
in
egypt
before
the
days
of
moses
is
however
certain
adolf
erman
asserts
that
even
in
early
times
the
educated
class
believed
all
the
deities
of
the
egyptian
religion
to
be
identical
and
that
the
priests
did
not
shut
their
eyes
to
this
doctrine
but
strove
to
grasp
the
idea
of
the
one
god
divided
into
different
persons
by
poesy
and
myth
the
priesthood
however
had
not
the
courage
to
take
the
final
step
to
do
away
with
those
distinctions
which
they
declared
to
be
immaterial
and
to
adore
the
one
god
under
the
one
name
it
was
left
to
amenhotep
iv
later
known
as
ikhnaton
to
proclaim
this
doctrine
openly
to
the
people
professor
breasted
has
described
the
hymns
of
praise
to
the
sun
god
which
ikhnaton
himself
wrote
on
the
walls
of
the
amarna
they
show
us
the
simplicity
and
beauty
of
the
young
king
faith
in
the
sole
god
he
had
gained
the
belief
that
one
god
created
not
only
all
the
lower
creatures
but
also
all
races
of
men
both
egyptians
and
foreigners
moreover
the
king
saw
in
his
god
a
kindly
father
who
maintained
all
his
creatures
by
his
goodness
in
all
the
progress
of
men
which
we
have
followed
through
thousands
of
years
no
one
had
ever
before
caught
such
a
vision
of
the
great
father
of
all
may
not
the
reason
why
ikhnaton
was
later
described
as
a
heretic
be
that
he
violated
the
code
of
the
priestly
hierarchy
by
revealing
this
secret
doctrine
to
the
profane
hence
too
perhaps
the
necessity
in
which
the
king
found
himself
of
suppressing
the
priesthood
which
by
persisting
in
its
exclusive
attitude
kept
what
he
perceived
to
be
the
truth
from
the
minds
of
the
people
the
earliest
european
centre
of
the
mysteries
appears
to
have
been
greece
where
the
eleusinian
mysteries
existed
at
a
very
early
date
pythagoras
who
was
born
in
samos
about
spent
some
years
in
egypt
where
he
was
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
isis
after
his
return
to
greece
pythagoras
is
said
to
have
been
initiated
into
the
eleusinian
mysteries
and
attempted
to
found
a
secret
society
in
samos
but
this
proving
unsuccessful
he
journeyed
on
to
crotona
in
italy
where
he
collected
around
him
a
great
number
of
disciples
and
finally
established
his
sect
this
was
divided
into
two
classes
of
initiates
the
first
admitted
only
into
the
exoteric
doctrines
of
the
master
with
whom
they
were
not
allowed
to
speak
until
after
a
period
of
five
years
probation
the
second
consisting
of
the
real
initiates
to
whom
all
the
mysteries
of
the
esoteric
doctrines
of
pythagoras
were
unfolded
this
course
of
instruction
given
after
the
manner
of
the
egyptians
by
means
of
images
and
symbols
began
with
geometrical
science
in
which
pythagoras
during
his
stay
in
egypt
had
become
an
adept
and
led
up
finally
to
abstruse
speculations
concerning
the
transmigration
of
the
soul
and
the
nature
of
god
who
was
represented
under
the
conception
of
a
universal
mind
diffused
through
all
things
it
is
however
as
the
precursor
of
secret
societies
formed
later
in
the
west
of
europe
that
the
sect
of
pythagoras
enters
into
the
scope
of
this
book
early
masonic
tradition
traces
freemasonry
partly
to
pythagoras
who
is
said
to
have
travelled
in
england
and
there
is
certainly
some
reason
to
believe
that
his
geometrical
ideas
entered
into
the
system
of
the
operative
guilds
of
masons
the
jewish
cabala
according
to
fabre
moses
who
was
learned
in
all
the
wisdom
of
the
egyptians
drew
from
the
egyptian
mysteries
a
part
of
the
oral
tradition
which
was
handed
down
through
the
leaders
of
the
israelites
that
such
an
oral
tradition
distinct
from
the
written
word
embodied
in
the
pentateuch
did
descend
from
moses
and
that
it
was
later
committed
to
writing
in
the
talmud
and
the
cabala
is
the
opinion
of
many
jewish
writers
the
first
form
of
the
talmud
called
the
mischna
appeared
in
about
the
second
or
third
century
a
little
later
a
commentary
was
added
under
the
name
of
the
gemara
these
two
works
compose
the
jerusalem
talmud
which
was
revised
in
the
third
to
the
fifth
centry
a
this
later
edition
was
named
the
babylonian
talmud
and
is
the
one
now
in
use
the
talmud
relates
mainly
to
the
affairs
of
everyday
life
the
laws
of
buying
and
selling
of
making
contracts
also
to
external
religious
observances
on
all
of
which
the
most
meticulous
details
are
given
as
a
jewish
writer
has
expressed
it
the
oddest
rabbinical
conceits
are
elaborated
through
many
volumes
with
the
finest
dialectic
and
the
most
absurd
questions
are
discussed
with
the
highest
efforts
of
intellectual
power
for
example
how
many
white
hairs
may
a
red
cow
have
and
yet
remain
a
cow
what
sort
of
scabs
require
this
or
that
purification
whether
a
louse
or
a
flea
may
be
killed
on
the
sabbath
the
first
being
allowed
while
the
second
is
a
deadly
sin
whether
the
slaughter
of
an
animal
ought
to
be
executed
at
the
neck
or
the
tail
whether
the
high
priest
put
on
his
shirt
or
his
hose
first
whether
the
that
is
the
brother
of
a
man
who
died
childless
being
required
by
law
to
marry
the
widow
is
relieved
from
his
obligation
if
he
falls
off
a
roof
and
sticks
in
the
mire
but
it
is
in
the
cabala
a
hebrew
word
signifying
reception
that
is
to
say
a
doctrine
orally
received
that
the
speculative
and
philosophical
or
rather
the
theosophical
doctrines
of
israel
are
to
be
found
these
are
contained
in
two
books
the
and
the
the
or
book
of
the
creation
is
described
by
edersheim
as
a
monologue
on
the
part
of
abraham
in
which
by
the
contemplation
of
all
that
is
around
him
he
ultimately
arrives
at
the
conclusion
of
the
unity
of
god
but
since
this
process
is
accomplished
by
an
arrangement
of
the
divine
emanations
under
the
name
of
the
ten
sephiroths
and
in
the
permutation
of
numerals
and
of
the
letters
of
the
hebrew
alphabet
it
would
certainly
convey
no
such
idea
nor
probably
indeed
any
idea
at
all
to
the
mind
uninitiated
into
cabalistic
systems
the
sepher
yetzirah
is
in
fact
admittedly
a
work
of
extraordinary
obscurity
and
almost
certainly
of
extreme
antiquity
monsieur
paul
vulliaud
in
his
exhaustive
work
on
the
cabala
recently
published
says
that
its
date
has
been
placed
as
early
as
the
sixth
century
before
christ
and
as
late
as
the
tenth
century
but
that
it
is
at
any
rate
older
than
the
talmud
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
in
the
talmud
the
rabbis
are
described
as
studying
it
for
magical
purposes
the
sepher
yetzirah
is
also
said
to
be
the
work
referred
to
in
the
koran
under
the
name
of
the
book
of
abraham
the
immense
compilation
known
as
the
or
book
of
light
is
however
of
greater
importance
to
the
study
of
cabalistic
philosophy
according
to
the
zohar
itself
the
mysteries
of
wisdom
were
imparted
to
adam
by
god
whilst
he
was
still
in
the
garden
of
eden
in
the
form
of
a
book
delivered
by
the
angel
razael
from
adam
the
book
passed
on
to
seth
then
to
enoch
to
noah
to
abraham
and
later
to
moses
one
of
its
principal
exponents
other
jewish
writers
declare
however
that
moses
received
it
for
the
first
time
on
mount
sinai
and
communicated
it
to
the
seventy
elders
by
whom
it
was
handed
down
to
david
and
solomon
then
to
ezra
and
nehemiah
and
finally
to
the
rabbis
of
the
early
christian
era
until
this
date
the
zohar
had
remained
a
purely
oral
tradition
but
now
for
the
first
time
it
is
said
to
have
been
written
down
by
the
disciples
of
simon
ben
jochai
the
talmud
relates
that
for
twelve
years
the
rabbi
simon
and
his
son
eliezer
concealed
themselves
in
a
cavern
where
sitting
in
the
sand
up
to
their
necks
they
meditated
on
the
sacred
law
and
were
frequently
visited
by
the
prophet
elias
in
this
way
jewish
legend
adds
the
great
book
of
the
zohar
was
composed
and
committed
to
writing
by
the
rabbi
son
eliezer
and
his
secretary
the
rabbi
abba
the
first
date
at
which
the
zohar
is
definitely
known
to
have
appeared
is
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
when
it
was
committed
to
writing
by
a
spanish
jew
moses
de
leon
who
according
to
ginsburg
said
he
had
discovered
and
reproduced
the
original
document
of
simon
ben
jochai
his
wife
and
daughter
however
declared
that
he
had
composed
it
all
himself
which
is
the
truth
jewish
opinion
is
strongly
divided
on
this
question
one
body
maintaining
that
the
zohar
is
the
comparatively
modern
work
of
moses
de
leon
the
other
declaring
it
to
be
of
extreme
antiquity
vulliaud
who
has
collated
all
these
views
in
the
course
of
some
fifty
pages
shows
that
although
the
name
zohar
might
have
originated
with
moses
de
leon
the
ideas
it
embodied
were
far
older
than
the
thirteenth
century
how
he
asks
pertinently
would
it
have
been
possible
for
the
rabbis
of
the
middle
ages
to
have
been
deceived
into
accepting
as
an
ancient
document
a
work
that
was
of
completely
modern
origin
obviously
the
zohar
was
not
the
composition
of
moses
de
leon
but
a
compilation
made
by
him
from
various
documents
dating
from
very
early
times
moreover
as
vulliaud
goes
on
to
explain
those
who
deny
its
antiquity
are
the
headed
by
graetz
whose
object
is
to
prove
the
cabala
to
be
at
variance
with
orthodox
judaism
theodore
reinach
goes
so
far
as
to
declare
the
cabala
to
be
a
subtle
poison
which
enters
into
the
veins
of
judaism
and
wholly
infests
it
salomon
reinach
calls
it
one
of
the
worst
aberrations
of
the
human
mind
this
view
many
a
student
of
the
cabala
will
hardly
dispute
but
to
say
that
it
is
foreign
to
judaism
is
another
matter
the
fact
is
that
the
main
ideas
of
the
zohar
find
confirmation
in
the
talmud
as
the
observes
the
cabala
is
not
really
in
opposition
to
the
talmud
and
many
talmudic
jews
have
supported
and
contributed
to
it
adolphe
franck
does
not
hesitate
to
describe
it
as
the
heart
and
life
of
judaism
the
greater
number
of
the
most
eminent
rabbis
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
believed
firmly
in
the
sacredness
of
the
zohar
and
the
infallibility
of
its
teaching
the
question
of
the
antiquity
of
the
cabala
is
therefore
in
reality
largely
a
matter
of
names
that
a
mystical
tradition
existed
amongst
the
jews
from
remote
antiquity
will
hardly
be
denied
by
anyone
it
is
therefore
as
vulliaud
observes
only
a
matter
of
knowing
at
what
moment
jewish
mysticism
took
the
name
of
cabala
edersheim
asserts
that
it
is
undeniable
that
already
at
the
time
of
jesus
christ
there
existed
an
assemblage
of
doctrines
and
speculations
that
were
carefully
concealed
from
the
multitude
they
were
not
even
revealed
to
ordinary
scholars
for
fear
of
leading
them
towards
heretical
ideas
this
kind
bore
the
name
of
kabbalah
and
as
the
term
of
kabbalah
to
receive
transmit
indicates
it
represented
the
spiritual
traditions
transmitted
from
the
earliest
ages
although
mingled
in
the
course
of
time
with
impure
or
foreign
elements
is
the
cabala
then
as
gougenot
des
mousseaux
asserts
older
than
the
jewish
race
a
legacy
handed
down
from
the
first
patriarchs
of
the
world
we
must
admit
this
hypothesis
to
be
incapable
of
proof
yet
it
is
one
that
has
found
so
much
favour
with
students
of
occult
traditions
that
it
can
not
be
ignored
the
jewish
cabala
itself
supports
it
by
tracing
its
descent
from
the
patriarchs
adam
noah
enoch
and
abraham
who
lived
before
the
jews
as
a
separate
race
came
into
existence
eliphas
lévi
accepts
this
genealogy
and
relates
that
the
holy
cabala
was
the
tradition
of
the
children
of
seth
carried
out
of
chaldea
by
abraham
who
was
the
inheritor
of
the
secrets
of
enoch
and
the
father
of
initiation
in
israel
according
to
this
theory
which
we
find
again
propounded
by
the
american
freemason
mackey
there
was
besides
the
divine
cabala
of
the
children
of
seth
the
magical
cabala
of
the
children
of
cain
which
descended
to
the
sabeists
or
of
chaldea
adepts
in
astrology
and
necromancy
sorcery
as
we
know
had
been
practised
by
the
canaanites
before
the
occupation
of
palestine
by
the
israelites
egypt
india
and
greece
also
had
their
soothsayers
and
diviners
in
spite
of
the
imprecations
against
sorcery
contained
in
the
law
of
moses
the
jews
disregarding
these
warnings
caught
the
contagion
and
mingled
the
sacred
tradition
they
had
inherited
with
magical
ideas
partly
borrowed
from
other
races
and
partly
of
their
own
devising
at
the
same
time
the
speculative
side
of
the
jewish
cabala
borrowed
from
the
philosophy
of
the
persian
magi
of
the
and
of
the
there
is
then
some
justification
for
the
contention
that
what
we
know
as
the
cabala
is
not
of
purely
jewish
origin
gougenot
des
mousseaux
who
had
made
a
profound
study
of
occultism
asserts
that
there
were
therefore
two
cabalas
the
ancient
sacred
tradition
handed
down
from
the
first
patriarchs
of
the
human
race
and
the
evil
cabala
wherein
this
sacred
tradition
was
mingled
by
the
rabbis
with
barbaric
superstitions
combined
with
their
own
imaginings
and
henceforth
marked
with
their
seal
this
view
also
finds
expression
in
the
remarkable
work
of
the
converted
jew
drach
who
refers
to
the
ancient
and
true
cabala
which
we
distinguish
from
the
modern
cabala
false
condemnable
and
condemned
by
the
holy
see
the
work
of
the
rabbis
who
have
also
falsified
and
perverted
the
talmudic
tradition
the
doctors
of
the
synagogue
trace
it
back
to
moses
whilst
at
the
same
time
admitting
that
the
principal
truths
it
contains
were
those
known
by
revelation
to
the
first
patriarchs
of
the
world
further
on
drach
quotes
the
statement
of
sixtus
of
sienna
another
converted
jew
and
a
dominican
protected
by
pius
v
since
by
the
decree
of
the
holy
roman
inquisition
all
books
appertaining
to
the
cabala
have
lately
been
condemned
one
must
know
that
the
cabala
is
double
that
one
is
true
the
other
false
the
true
and
pious
one
is
that
which
elucidates
the
secret
mysteries
of
the
holy
law
according
to
the
principle
of
anagogy
figurative
interpretation
this
cabala
therefore
the
church
has
never
condemned
the
false
and
impious
cabala
is
a
certain
mendacious
kind
of
jewish
tradition
full
of
innumerable
vanities
and
falsehoods
differing
but
little
from
necromancy
this
kind
of
superstition
therefore
improperly
called
cabala
the
church
within
the
last
few
years
has
deservedly
condemned
the
modern
jewish
cabala
presents
a
dual
aspect
theoretical
and
practical
the
former
concerned
with
theosophical
speculations
the
latter
with
magical
practices
it
would
be
impossible
here
to
give
an
idea
of
cabalistic
theosophy
with
its
extraordinary
imaginings
on
the
sephiroths
the
attributes
and
functions
of
good
and
bad
angels
dissertations
on
the
nature
of
demons
and
minute
details
on
the
appearance
of
god
under
the
name
of
the
ancient
of
ancients
from
whose
head
worlds
receive
the
light
the
length
of
this
face
from
the
top
of
the
head
is
three
hundred
and
seventy
times
ten
thousand
worlds
it
is
called
the
face
for
such
is
the
name
of
the
ancient
of
ancients
the
description
of
the
hair
and
beard
alone
belonging
to
this
gigantic
countenance
occupies
a
large
place
in
the
zoharic
treatise
idra
raba
according
to
the
cabala
every
letter
in
the
scriptures
contains
a
mystery
only
to
be
solved
by
the
initiated
by
means
of
this
system
of
interpretation
passages
of
the
old
testament
are
shown
to
bear
meanings
totally
unapparent
to
the
ordinary
reader
thus
the
zohar
explains
that
noah
was
lamed
for
life
by
the
bite
of
a
lion
whilst
he
was
in
the
ark
the
adventures
of
jonah
inside
the
whale
are
related
with
an
extraordinary
wealth
of
imagination
whilst
the
beautiful
story
of
elisha
and
the
shunnamite
woman
is
travestied
in
the
most
grotesque
manner
in
the
practical
cabala
this
method
of
decoding
is
reduced
to
a
theurgic
or
magical
system
in
which
the
healing
of
diseases
plays
an
important
part
and
is
effected
by
means
of
the
mystical
arrangement
of
numbers
and
letters
by
the
pronunciation
of
the
ineffable
name
by
the
use
of
amulets
and
talismans
or
by
compounds
supposed
to
contain
certain
occult
properties
all
these
ideas
derived
from
very
ancient
cults
even
the
art
of
working
miracles
by
the
use
of
the
divine
name
which
after
the
appropriation
of
the
cabala
by
the
jews
became
the
particular
practice
of
jewish
appears
to
have
originated
in
chaldea
nor
can
the
insistence
on
the
chosen
people
theory
which
forms
the
basis
of
all
talmudic
and
cabalistic
writings
be
regarded
as
of
purely
jewish
origin
the
ancient
egyptians
likewise
believed
themselves
to
be
the
peculiar
people
specially
loved
by
the
gods
but
in
the
hands
of
the
jews
this
belief
became
a
pretension
to
the
exclusive
enjoyment
of
divine
favour
according
to
the
zohar
all
israelites
will
have
a
part
in
the
future
world
and
on
arrival
there
will
not
be
handed
over
like
the
or
races
to
the
hands
of
the
angel
douma
and
sent
down
to
hell
indeed
the
are
even
denied
human
attributes
thus
the
zohar
again
explains
that
the
words
of
the
scripture
jehovah
elohim
made
man
mean
that
he
made
israel
the
rabbinical
treatise
emek
ha
melek
observes
our
rabbis
of
blessed
memory
have
said
jews
are
men
because
of
the
soul
ye
have
from
the
supreme
man
god
but
the
nations
of
the
world
are
not
styled
men
because
they
have
not
from
the
holy
and
supreme
man
the
neschama
or
glorious
soul
but
they
have
the
nephesch
soul
from
adam
belial
that
is
the
malicious
and
unnecessary
man
called
sammael
the
supreme
devil
in
conformity
with
this
exclusive
attitude
towards
the
rest
of
the
human
race
the
messianic
idea
which
forms
the
dominating
theme
of
the
cabala
is
made
to
serve
purely
jewish
interests
yet
in
its
origins
this
idea
was
possibly
not
jewish
it
is
said
by
believers
in
an
ancient
secret
tradition
common
to
other
races
besides
the
jews
that
a
part
of
this
tradition
related
to
a
past
golden
age
when
man
was
free
from
care
and
evil
to
the
subsequent
fall
of
man
and
the
loss
of
this
primitive
felicity
and
finally
to
a
revelation
received
from
heaven
foretelling
the
reparation
of
this
loss
and
the
coming
of
a
redeemer
who
should
save
the
world
and
restore
the
golden
age
according
to
drach
the
tradition
of
a
who
should
present
himself
as
the
teacher
and
liberator
of
the
fallen
human
race
was
constantly
taught
amongst
all
the
enlightened
nations
of
the
globe
et
constans
as
suetonius
says
it
is
of
all
times
and
of
all
places
and
drach
goes
on
to
quote
the
evidence
of
volney
who
had
travelled
in
the
east
and
declared
that
the
sacred
and
mythological
traditions
of
earlier
times
had
spread
throughout
all
asia
the
belief
in
a
great
mediator
who
was
to
come
of
a
future
saviour
king
god
conqueror
and
legislator
who
would
bring
back
the
golden
age
to
earth
and
deliver
men
from
the
empire
of
evil
all
that
can
be
said
with
any
degree
of
certainty
with
regard
to
this
belief
is
that
it
did
exist
amongst
the
zoroastrians
of
persia
as
well
as
amongst
the
jews
quoting
abulfaraj
shows
that
five
hundred
years
before
christ
zerdascht
the
leader
of
the
zoroastrians
predicted
the
coming
of
the
messiah
at
whose
birth
a
star
would
appear
he
also
told
his
disciples
that
the
messiah
would
be
born
of
a
virgin
that
they
would
be
the
first
to
hear
of
him
and
that
they
should
bring
him
gifts
drach
believes
that
this
tradition
was
taught
in
the
ancient
synagogue
thus
explaining
the
words
of
paul
that
unto
the
jews
were
committed
the
oracles
of
god
this
oral
doctrine
which
is
the
cabala
had
for
its
object
the
most
sublime
truths
of
the
faith
which
it
brought
back
incessantly
to
the
promised
redeemer
the
foundation
of
the
whole
system
of
the
ancient
tradition
drach
further
asserts
that
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
formed
a
part
of
this
tradition
whoever
has
familiarized
himself
with
that
which
was
taught
by
the
ancient
doctors
of
the
synagogue
particularly
those
who
lived
before
the
coming
of
the
saviour
knows
that
the
trinity
in
one
god
was
a
truth
admitted
amongst
them
from
the
earliest
times
vulliaud
points
out
that
graetz
admits
the
existence
of
this
idea
in
the
zohar
it
even
taught
certain
doctrines
which
appeared
favourable
to
the
christian
dogma
of
the
trinity
and
again
it
is
incontestable
that
the
zohar
makes
allusions
to
the
beliefs
in
the
trinity
and
the
incarnation
vulliaud
adds
the
idea
of
the
trinity
must
therefore
play
an
important
part
in
the
cabala
since
it
has
been
possible
to
affirm
that
characteristic
of
the
zohar
and
its
particular
conception
is
its
attachment
to
the
principle
of
the
trinity
and
further
quotes
edersheim
as
saying
that
a
great
part
of
the
explanation
given
in
the
writings
of
the
cabalists
resembles
in
a
surprising
manner
the
highest
truths
of
christianity
it
would
appear
then
that
certain
remnants
of
the
ancient
secret
tradition
lingered
on
in
the
cabala
the
perhaps
unintentionally
endorses
this
opinion
since
in
deriding
the
christian
cabalists
for
asserting
that
the
cabala
contained
traces
of
christianity
it
goes
on
to
say
that
what
appears
to
be
christian
in
the
cabala
is
only
ancient
esoteric
doctrine
here
then
we
have
it
on
the
authority
of
modern
jewish
scholars
that
the
ancient
secret
tradition
was
in
harmony
with
christian
teaching
but
in
the
teaching
of
the
later
synagogue
the
philosophy
of
the
earlier
sages
was
narrowed
down
to
suit
the
exclusive
system
of
the
jewish
hierarchy
and
the
ancient
hope
of
a
redeemer
who
should
restore
man
to
the
state
of
felicity
he
had
lost
at
the
fall
was
transformed
into
the
idea
of
salvation
for
the
jews
alone
under
the
ægis
of
a
triumphant
and
even
an
avenging
messiah
it
is
this
messianic
dream
perpetuated
in
the
modern
cabala
which
nineteen
hundred
years
ago
the
advent
of
christ
on
earth
came
to
disturb
the
coming
of
the
redeemer
the
fact
that
many
christian
doctrines
such
as
the
conception
of
a
trinity
the
miraculous
birth
and
murder
of
a
deity
had
found
a
place
in
earlier
religions
has
frequently
been
used
as
an
argument
to
show
that
the
story
of
christ
was
merely
a
new
version
of
various
ancient
legends
those
of
attis
adonis
or
of
osiris
and
that
consequently
the
christian
religion
is
founded
on
a
myth
the
answer
to
this
is
that
the
existence
of
christ
on
earth
is
an
historic
fact
which
no
serious
authority
has
ever
denied
the
attempts
of
such
writers
as
drews
and
robertson
to
establish
the
theory
of
the
which
find
an
echo
in
the
utterances
of
socialist
orators
have
been
met
with
so
much
able
criticism
as
to
need
no
further
refutation
sir
james
frazer
who
will
certainly
not
be
accused
of
bigoted
orthodoxy
observes
in
this
connexion
the
doubts
which
have
been
cast
on
the
historical
reality
of
jesus
are
in
my
judgement
unworthy
of
serious
attention
to
dissolve
the
founder
of
christianity
into
a
myth
as
some
would
do
is
hardly
less
absurd
than
it
would
be
to
do
the
same
for
mohammed
luther
and
calvin
may
not
the
fact
that
certain
circumstances
in
the
life
of
christ
were
foreshadowed
by
earlier
religions
indicate
as
eliphas
lévi
observes
that
the
ancients
had
an
intuition
of
christian
mysteries
to
those
therefore
who
had
adhered
to
the
ancient
tradition
christ
appeared
as
the
fulfilment
of
a
prophecy
as
old
as
the
world
thus
the
wise
men
came
from
afar
to
worship
the
babe
of
bethlehem
and
when
they
saw
his
star
in
the
east
they
rejoiced
with
exceeding
great
joy
in
christ
they
hailed
not
only
him
who
was
born
king
of
the
jews
but
the
saviour
of
the
whole
human
race
in
the
light
of
this
great
hope
that
wondrous
night
in
bethlehem
is
seen
in
all
its
sublimity
throughout
the
ages
the
seers
had
looked
for
the
coming
of
the
redeemer
and
lo
he
was
here
but
it
was
not
to
the
mighty
in
israel
to
the
high
priests
and
the
scribes
that
his
birth
was
announced
but
to
humble
shepherds
watching
their
flocks
by
night
and
these
men
of
simple
faith
hearing
from
the
angels
the
good
tidings
of
great
joy
that
a
saviour
christ
the
lord
was
born
went
with
haste
to
see
the
babe
lying
in
the
manger
and
returned
glorifying
and
praising
god
so
also
to
the
devout
in
israel
to
simeon
and
to
anna
the
prophetess
the
great
event
appeared
in
its
universal
significance
and
simeon
departing
in
peace
knew
that
his
eyes
had
seen
the
salvation
that
was
to
be
a
light
to
lighten
the
gentiles
as
well
as
the
glory
of
the
people
of
israel
but
to
the
jews
in
whose
hands
the
ancient
tradition
had
been
turned
to
the
exclusive
advantage
of
the
jewish
race
to
the
rabbis
who
had
moreover
constituted
themselves
the
sole
guardians
within
this
nation
of
the
said
tradition
the
manner
of
its
fulfilment
was
necessarily
abhorrent
instead
of
a
resplendent
messiah
who
should
be
presented
by
them
to
the
people
a
saviour
was
born
amongst
the
people
themselves
and
brought
to
jerusalem
to
be
presented
to
the
lord
a
saviour
moreover
who
as
time
went
on
imparted
his
divine
message
to
the
poor
and
humble
and
declared
that
his
kingdom
was
not
of
this
world
this
was
clearly
what
mary
meant
when
she
said
that
god
had
scattered
the
proud
in
the
imagination
of
their
hearts
that
he
had
put
down
the
mighty
from
their
seats
and
exalted
them
of
low
degree
christ
was
therefore
doubly
hateful
to
the
jewish
hierarchy
in
that
he
attacked
the
privilege
of
the
race
to
which
they
belonged
by
throwing
open
the
door
to
all
mankind
and
the
privilege
of
the
caste
to
which
they
belonged
by
revealing
sacred
doctrines
to
the
profane
and
destroying
their
claim
to
exclusive
knowledge
unless
viewed
from
this
aspect
neither
the
antagonism
displayed
by
the
scribes
and
pharisees
towards
our
lord
nor
the
denunciations
he
uttered
against
them
can
be
properly
understood
woe
unto
you
lawyers
for
ye
have
taken
away
the
key
of
knowledge
ye
entered
not
in
yourselves
and
them
that
were
entering
in
ye
hindered
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
shut
up
the
kingdom
of
heaven
against
men
tor
ye
neither
go
in
yourselves
neither
suffer
ye
them
that
are
entering
to
go
in
what
did
christ
mean
by
the
key
of
knowledge
clearly
the
sacred
tradition
which
as
drach
explains
foreshadowed
the
doctrines
of
christianity
it
was
the
rabbis
who
perverted
that
tradition
and
thus
the
guilt
of
these
perfidious
doctors
consisted
in
their
concealing
from
the
people
the
traditional
explanation
of
the
sacred
books
by
means
of
which
they
would
have
been
able
to
recognize
the
messiah
in
the
person
of
jesus
christ
many
of
the
people
however
did
recognize
him
indeed
the
multitude
acclaimed
him
spreading
their
garments
before
him
and
crying
hosanna
to
the
son
of
david
blessed
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
writers
who
have
cited
the
choice
of
barabbas
in
the
place
of
christ
as
an
instance
of
misguided
popular
judgement
overlook
the
fact
that
this
choice
was
not
spontaneous
it
was
the
chief
priests
who
delivered
christ
from
envy
and
who
moved
the
people
that
pilate
should
rather
release
unto
them
barabbas
the
people
obediently
cried
out
crucify
him
so
also
it
was
the
rabbis
who
after
hiding
from
the
people
the
meaning
of
the
sacred
tradition
at
the
moment
of
its
fulfilment
afterwards
poisoned
that
same
stream
for
future
generations
abominable
calumnies
on
christ
and
christianity
occur
not
only
in
the
cabala
but
in
the
earlier
editions
of
the
talmud
in
these
says
barclay
our
lord
and
saviour
is
that
one
such
a
one
a
fool
the
leper
the
deceiver
of
israel
etc
efforts
are
made
to
prove
that
he
is
the
son
of
joseph
pandira
before
his
marriage
with
mary
his
miracles
are
attributed
to
sorcery
the
secret
of
which
he
brought
in
a
slit
in
his
flesh
out
of
egypt
he
is
said
to
have
been
first
stoned
and
then
hanged
on
the
eve
of
the
passover
his
disciples
are
called
heretics
and
opprobrious
names
they
are
accused
of
immoral
practices
and
the
new
testament
is
called
a
sinful
book
the
references
to
these
subjects
manifest
the
most
bitter
aversion
and
hatred
one
might
look
in
vain
for
passages
such
as
these
in
english
or
french
translations
of
the
talmud
for
the
reason
that
no
complete
translation
exists
in
these
languages
this
fact
is
of
great
significance
whilst
the
sacred
books
of
every
other
important
religion
have
been
rendered
into
our
own
tongue
and
are
open
to
everyone
to
study
the
book
that
forms
the
foundation
of
modern
judaism
is
closed
to
the
general
public
we
can
read
english
translations
of
the
koran
of
the
dhammapada
of
the
sutta
nipata
of
the
zend
avesta
of
the
shu
king
of
the
laws
of
manu
of
the
bhagavadgita
but
we
can
not
read
the
talmud
in
the
long
series
of
sacred
books
of
the
east
the
talmud
finds
no
place
all
that
is
accessible
to
the
ordinary
reader
consists
on
one
hand
in
expurgated
versions
or
judicious
selections
by
jewish
and
compilers
and
on
the
other
hand
in
publications
on
which
it
would
be
dangerous
to
place
reliance
the
principal
english
translation
by
rodkinson
is
very
incomplete
and
the
folios
are
nowhere
indicated
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
look
up
a
passage
the
french
translation
by
jean
de
pauly
b
professes
to
present
the
entire
text
of
the
venetian
talmud
of
but
it
does
nothing
of
the
kind
the
translator
in
the
preface
in
fact
admits
that
he
has
left
out
sterile
discussions
and
has
throughout
attempted
to
tone
down
the
brutality
of
certain
expressions
which
offend
our
ears
this
of
course
affords
him
infinite
latitude
so
that
all
passages
likely
to
prove
displeasing
to
the
hébraisants
to
whom
his
work
is
particularly
dedicated
are
discreetly
expunged
jean
de
pauly
translation
of
the
cabala
appears
however
to
be
complete
but
a
fair
and
honest
rendering
of
the
whole
talmud
into
english
or
french
still
remains
to
be
made
moreover
even
the
hebrew
scholar
is
obliged
to
exercise
some
discrimination
if
he
desires
to
consult
the
talmud
in
its
original
form
for
by
the
sixteenth
century
when
the
study
of
hebrew
became
general
amongst
christians
the
antisocial
and
tendencies
of
the
talmud
attracted
the
attention
of
the
censor
and
in
the
bâle
talmud
of
the
most
obnoxious
passages
and
the
entire
treatise
abodah
zara
were
suppressed
in
the
cracow
edition
of
that
followed
these
passages
were
restored
by
the
jews
a
proceeding
which
aroused
so
much
indignation
amongst
christian
students
of
hebrew
that
the
jews
became
alarmed
accordingly
a
jewish
synod
assembled
in
poland
in
ordered
the
offending
passages
to
be
expunged
again
but
according
to
drach
to
be
replaced
by
circles
which
the
rabbis
were
to
fill
in
orally
when
giving
instruction
to
young
jews
after
that
date
the
talmud
was
for
a
time
carefully
bowdlerized
so
that
in
order
to
discover
its
original
form
it
is
advisable
to
go
back
to
the
venetian
talmud
of
before
any
omissions
were
made
or
to
consult
a
modern
edition
for
now
that
the
jews
no
longer
fear
the
christians
these
passages
are
all
said
to
have
been
replaced
and
no
attempt
is
made
as
in
the
middle
ages
to
prove
that
they
do
not
refer
to
the
founder
of
christianity
thus
the
admits
that
jewish
legends
concerning
jesus
are
found
in
the
talmud
and
midrash
and
in
the
life
of
jesus
toledot
yeshu
that
originated
in
the
middle
ages
it
is
the
tendency
of
all
these
sources
to
belittle
the
person
of
jesus
by
ascribing
to
him
illegitimate
birth
magic
and
a
shameful
death
the
last
work
mentioned
the
or
the
toldos
described
here
as
originating
in
the
middle
ages
probably
belongs
in
reality
to
a
much
earlier
period
eliphas
lévi
asserts
that
the
sepher
toldos
to
which
the
jews
attribute
a
great
antiquity
and
which
they
hid
from
the
christians
with
such
precautions
that
this
book
was
for
a
long
while
unfindable
is
quoted
for
the
first
time
by
raymond
martin
of
the
order
of
the
preaching
brothers
towards
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
this
book
was
evidently
written
by
a
rabbi
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
cabala
whether
then
the
toledot
yeshu
had
existed
for
many
centuries
before
it
was
first
brought
to
light
or
whether
it
was
a
collection
of
jewish
traditions
woven
into
a
coherent
narrative
by
a
rabbi
the
ideas
it
contains
can
be
traced
back
at
least
as
far
as
the
second
century
of
the
christian
era
origen
who
in
the
middle
of
the
third
century
wrote
his
reply
to
the
attack
of
celsus
on
christianity
refers
to
a
scandalous
story
closely
resembling
the
toledot
yeshu
which
celsus
who
lived
towards
the
end
of
the
second
century
had
quoted
on
the
authority
of
a
jew
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
legend
it
contains
had
long
been
current
in
jewish
circles
but
the
book
itself
did
not
come
into
the
hands
of
christians
until
it
was
translated
into
latin
by
raymond
martin
later
on
luther
summarized
it
in
german
under
the
name
of
wagenseil
in
and
huldrich
in
published
latin
translations
it
is
also
to
be
found
in
french
in
gustave
however
repugnant
it
is
to
transcribe
any
portion
of
this
blasphemous
work
its
main
outline
must
be
given
here
in
order
to
trace
the
subsequent
course
of
the
secret
tradition
in
which
as
we
shall
see
it
has
been
perpetuated
up
to
our
own
day
briefly
then
the
toledot
yeshu
relates
with
the
most
indecent
details
that
miriam
a
hairdresser
of
bethlehem
affianced
to
a
young
man
named
jochanan
was
seduced
by
a
libertine
joseph
panther
or
pandira
and
gave
birth
to
a
son
whom
she
named
johosuah
or
jeschu
according
to
the
talmudic
authors
of
the
sota
and
the
sanhedrim
jeschu
was
taken
during
his
boyhood
to
egypt
where
he
was
initiated
into
the
secret
doctrines
of
the
priests
and
on
his
return
to
palestine
gave
himself
up
to
the
practice
of
magic
the
toledot
yeshu
however
goes
on
to
say
that
on
reaching
manhood
jeschu
learnt
the
secret
of
his
illegitimacy
on
account
of
which
he
was
driven
out
of
the
synagogue
and
took
refuge
for
a
time
in
galilee
now
there
was
in
the
temple
a
stone
on
which
was
engraved
the
tetragrammaton
or
schem
hamphorasch
that
is
to
say
the
ineffable
name
of
god
this
stone
had
been
found
by
king
david
when
the
foundations
of
the
temple
were
being
prepared
and
was
deposited
by
him
in
the
holy
of
holies
jeschu
knowing
this
came
from
galilee
and
penetrating
into
the
holy
of
holies
read
the
ineffable
name
which
he
transcribed
on
to
a
piece
of
parchment
and
concealed
in
an
incision
under
his
skin
by
this
means
he
was
able
to
work
miracles
and
to
persuade
the
people
that
he
was
the
son
of
god
foretold
by
isaiah
with
the
aid
of
judas
the
sages
of
the
synagogue
succeeded
in
capturing
jeschu
who
was
then
led
before
the
great
and
little
sanhedrim
by
whom
he
was
condemned
to
be
stoned
to
death
and
finally
hanged
such
is
the
story
of
christ
according
to
the
jewish
cabalists
which
should
be
compared
not
only
with
the
christian
tradition
but
with
that
of
the
moslems
it
is
perhaps
not
sufficiently
known
that
the
koran
whilst
denying
the
divinity
of
christ
and
also
the
fact
of
his
crucifixion
nevertheless
indignantly
denounces
the
infamous
legends
concerning
him
perpetuated
by
the
jews
and
confirms
in
beautiful
language
the
story
of
the
annunciation
and
the
doctrine
of
the
miraculous
conception
remember
when
the
angels
said
mary
verily
hath
god
chosen
thee
and
purified
thee
and
chosen
thee
above
the
women
of
the
worlds
remember
when
the
angels
said
mary
verily
god
announceth
to
thee
the
word
from
him
his
name
shall
be
messiah
jesus
the
son
of
mary
illustrious
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
and
one
of
those
who
have
near
access
to
god
the
mother
of
jesus
is
shown
to
have
been
pure
and
to
have
kept
her
maidenhood
it
was
the
jews
who
spoke
against
mary
a
grievous
calumny
jesus
himself
is
described
as
strengthened
with
the
holy
spirit
and
the
jews
are
reproached
for
rejecting
the
apostle
of
god
to
whom
was
given
the
evangel
with
its
guidance
and
light
confirmatory
of
the
preceding
law
thus
during
the
centuries
that
saw
the
birth
of
christianity
although
other
forces
arrayed
themselves
against
the
new
faith
it
was
left
to
the
jews
to
inaugurate
a
campaign
of
vilification
against
the
person
of
its
founder
whom
moslems
to
this
day
revere
as
one
of
the
great
teachers
of
the
world
the
essenes
a
subtler
device
for
discrediting
christianity
and
undermining
belief
in
the
divine
character
of
our
lord
has
been
adopted
by
modern
writers
principally
jewish
who
set
out
to
prove
that
he
belonged
to
the
sect
of
the
essenes
a
community
of
ascetics
holding
all
goods
in
common
which
had
existed
in
palestine
before
the
birth
of
christ
thus
the
jewish
historian
graetz
declares
that
jesus
simply
appropriated
to
himself
the
essential
features
of
essenism
and
that
primitive
christianity
was
nothing
but
an
offshoot
of
essenism
the
christian
jew
ginsburg
partially
endorses
this
view
in
a
small
pamphlet
containing
most
of
the
evidence
that
has
been
brought
forward
on
the
subject
and
himself
expresses
the
opinion
that
it
will
hardly
be
doubted
that
our
saviour
himself
belonged
to
this
holy
brotherhood
so
after
representing
christ
as
a
magician
in
the
toledot
yeshu
and
the
talmud
jewish
tradition
seeks
to
explain
his
miraculous
works
as
those
of
a
mere
healer
an
idea
that
we
shall
find
descending
right
through
the
secret
societies
to
this
day
of
course
if
this
were
true
if
the
miracles
of
christ
were
simply
due
to
a
knowledge
of
natural
laws
and
his
doctrines
were
the
outcome
of
a
sect
the
whole
theory
of
his
divine
power
and
mission
falls
to
the
ground
this
is
why
it
is
essential
to
expose
the
fallacies
and
even
the
bad
faith
on
which
the
attempt
to
identify
him
with
the
essenes
is
based
now
we
have
only
to
study
the
gospels
carefully
in
order
to
realize
that
the
teachings
of
christ
were
totally
different
from
those
peculiar
to
the
essenes
christ
did
not
live
in
a
fraternity
but
as
ginsburg
himself
points
out
associated
with
publicans
and
sinners
the
essenes
did
not
frequent
the
temple
and
christ
was
there
frequently
the
essenes
disapproved
of
wine
and
marriage
whilst
christ
sanctioned
marriage
by
his
presence
at
the
wedding
of
cana
in
galilee
and
there
turned
water
into
wine
a
further
point
the
most
conclusive
of
all
ginsburg
ignores
namely
that
one
of
the
principal
traits
of
the
essenes
which
distinguished
them
from
the
other
jewish
sects
of
their
day
was
their
disapproval
of
ointment
which
they
regarded
as
defiling
whilst
christ
not
only
commended
the
woman
who
brought
the
precious
jar
of
ointment
but
reproached
simon
for
the
omission
my
head
with
oil
thou
didst
not
anoint
but
this
woman
hath
anointed
my
feet
with
ointment
it
is
obvious
that
if
christ
had
been
an
essene
but
had
departed
from
his
usual
custom
on
this
occasion
out
of
deference
to
the
woman
feelings
he
would
have
understood
why
simon
had
not
offered
him
the
same
attention
and
at
any
rate
simon
would
have
excused
himself
on
these
grounds
further
if
his
disciples
had
been
essenes
would
they
not
have
protested
against
this
violation
of
their
principles
instead
of
merely
objecting
that
the
ointment
was
of
too
costly
a
kind
but
it
is
in
attributing
to
christ
the
communistic
doctrines
of
the
essenes
that
ginsburg
conclusions
are
the
most
misleading
a
point
of
particular
importance
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
is
on
this
false
hypothesis
that
christian
socialism
has
been
built
up
the
essenes
he
writes
had
all
things
in
common
and
appointed
one
of
the
brethren
as
steward
to
manage
the
common
bag
so
the
primitive
christians
acts
ii
iv
john
xii
xiii
it
is
perfectly
true
that
as
the
first
reference
to
the
acts
testifies
some
of
the
primitive
christians
after
the
death
of
christ
formed
themselves
into
a
body
having
all
things
in
common
but
there
is
not
the
slightest
evidence
that
christ
and
his
disciples
followed
this
principle
the
solitary
passages
in
the
gospel
of
john
which
are
all
that
ginsburg
can
quote
in
support
of
this
contention
may
have
referred
to
an
or
a
fund
for
certain
expenses
not
to
a
common
pool
of
all
monetary
wealth
still
less
is
there
any
evidence
that
christ
advocated
communism
to
the
world
in
general
when
the
young
man
having
great
possessions
asked
what
he
should
do
to
inherit
eternal
life
christ
told
him
to
follow
the
commandments
but
on
the
young
man
asking
what
more
he
could
do
answered
if
thou
wilt
be
perfect
go
and
sell
that
thou
hast
and
give
to
the
poor
renunciation
but
not
the
pooling
of
all
wealth
was
thus
a
counsel
of
perfection
for
the
few
who
desired
to
devote
their
lives
to
god
as
monks
and
nuns
have
always
done
and
bore
no
relation
to
the
communistic
system
of
the
essenes
ginsburg
goes
on
to
say
essenism
put
all
its
members
on
the
same
level
forbidding
the
exercise
of
authority
of
one
over
the
other
and
enjoining
mutual
service
so
christ
matt
xx
mark
ix
x
essenism
commanded
its
disciples
to
call
no
man
master
upon
the
earth
so
christ
matt
xxiii
as
a
matter
of
fact
christ
strongly
upheld
the
exercise
of
authority
not
only
in
the
passage
render
to
cæsar
the
things
that
are
cæsar
but
in
his
approval
of
the
centurion
speech
i
am
a
man
under
authority
having
soldiers
under
me
and
i
say
to
this
man
go
and
he
goeth
and
to
another
come
and
he
cometh
and
to
my
servant
do
this
and
he
doeth
it
everywhere
christ
commends
the
faithful
servant
and
enjoins
obedience
to
masters
if
we
look
up
the
reference
to
the
gospel
of
matthew
where
ginsburg
says
that
christ
commanded
his
disciples
to
call
no
man
master
on
earth
we
shall
find
that
he
has
not
only
perverted
the
sense
of
the
passage
but
reversed
the
order
of
the
words
which
following
on
a
denunciation
of
the
jewish
rabbis
runs
thus
but
be
not
ye
called
rabbi
for
one
is
your
master
even
christ
and
all
ye
are
brethren
neither
be
ye
called
masters
for
one
is
your
master
even
christ
but
he
that
is
greatest
among
you
shall
be
your
servant
the
apostles
were
therefore
never
ordered
to
call
no
man
master
but
not
to
be
called
master
themselves
moreover
if
we
refer
to
the
greek
text
we
shall
see
that
this
was
meant
in
a
spiritual
and
not
a
social
sense
the
word
for
master
here
given
is
in
the
first
verse
διδάσκαλος
teacher
in
the
second
καθηγητὴς
literally
guide
and
the
word
is
servant
is
διακὸνοσ
when
masters
and
servants
in
the
social
sense
are
referred
to
in
the
gospels
the
word
employed
for
master
is
κύριος
and
for
servant
δοῦλος
ginsburg
should
have
been
aware
of
this
distinction
and
that
the
passage
in
question
had
therefore
no
bearing
on
his
argument
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
would
appear
that
some
of
the
apostles
kept
servants
since
christ
commends
them
for
exacting
strict
attention
to
duty
which
of
you
having
a
servant
ploughing
or
feeding
cattle
will
say
unto
him
by
and
by
when
he
is
come
from
the
field
go
and
sit
down
to
meat
and
will
not
rather
say
unto
him
make
ready
wherewith
i
may
sup
and
gird
thyself
and
serve
me
till
i
have
eaten
and
drunken
and
afterwards
thou
shalt
eat
and
drink
doth
he
thank
that
servant
because
he
did
the
things
that
were
commanded
to
him
i
trow
not
this
passage
would
alone
suffice
to
show
that
christ
and
his
apostles
did
not
inhabit
communities
where
all
were
equal
but
followed
the
usual
practices
of
the
social
system
under
which
they
lived
though
adopting
certain
rules
such
as
taking
only
one
garment
and
carrying
no
money
when
they
went
on
journeys
those
resemblances
between
the
teaching
of
the
essenes
and
the
sermon
on
the
mount
which
ginsburg
indicates
refer
not
to
the
customs
of
a
sect
but
to
general
precepts
for
human
conduct
humility
meekness
charity
and
so
forth
at
the
same
time
it
is
clear
that
if
the
essenes
in
general
conformed
to
some
of
the
principles
laid
down
by
christ
certain
of
their
doctrines
were
completely
at
variance
with
those
of
christ
and
of
primitive
christians
in
particular
their
custom
of
praying
to
the
rising
sun
and
their
disbelief
in
the
resurrection
of
the
body
paul
denounces
asceticism
the
cardinal
doctrine
of
the
essenes
in
unmeasured
terms
warning
the
brethren
that
in
the
latter
times
some
shall
depart
from
the
faith
giving
heed
to
seducing
spirits
and
doctrines
of
devils
forbidding
to
marry
and
commanding
to
abstain
from
meats
which
god
hath
created
to
be
received
with
thanksgiving
of
them
which
believe
and
know
the
truth
for
every
creature
of
god
is
good
and
nothing
to
be
refused
if
it
be
received
with
thanksgiving
if
thou
put
the
brethren
in
remembrance
of
these
things
thou
shalt
be
a
good
minister
of
jesus
christ
this
would
suggest
that
certain
essenean
ideas
had
crept
into
christian
communities
and
were
regarded
by
those
who
remembered
christ
true
teaching
as
a
dangerous
perversion
the
essenes
were
therefore
not
christians
but
a
secret
society
practising
four
degrees
of
initiation
and
bound
by
terrible
oaths
not
to
divulge
the
sacred
mysteries
confided
to
them
and
what
were
those
mysteries
but
those
of
the
jewish
secret
tradition
which
we
now
know
as
the
cabala
ginsburg
throws
an
important
light
on
essenism
when
in
one
passage
alone
he
refers
to
the
obligation
of
the
essenes
not
to
divulge
the
secret
doctrines
to
anyone
carefully
to
preserve
the
books
belonging
to
their
sect
and
the
names
of
the
angels
or
the
mysteries
connected
with
the
tetragrammaton
and
the
other
names
of
god
and
the
angels
comprised
in
the
theosophy
as
well
as
with
the
cosmogony
which
also
played
so
important
a
part
among
the
jewish
mystics
and
the
kabbalists
the
truth
is
clearly
that
the
essenes
were
cabalists
though
doubtless
cabalists
of
a
superior
kind
the
cabal
they
possessed
very
possibly
descended
from
times
and
had
remained
uncontaminated
by
the
strain
introduced
into
it
by
the
rabbis
after
the
death
of
christ
the
essenes
are
of
importance
to
the
subject
of
this
book
as
the
first
of
the
secret
societies
from
which
a
direct
line
of
tradition
can
be
traced
up
to
the
present
day
but
if
in
this
peaceful
community
no
actually
influence
is
to
be
discerned
the
same
can
not
be
said
of
the
succeeding
sects
which
whilst
professing
christianity
mingled
with
christian
doctrines
the
poison
of
the
perverted
cabala
main
source
of
the
errors
which
henceforth
rent
the
christian
church
in
twain
the
gnostics
the
first
school
of
thought
to
create
a
schism
in
christianity
was
the
collection
of
sects
known
under
the
generic
name
of
gnosticism
in
its
purer
forms
gnosticism
aimed
at
supplementing
faith
by
knowledge
of
eternal
verities
and
at
giving
a
wider
meaning
to
christianity
by
linking
it
up
with
earlier
faiths
the
belief
that
the
divinity
had
been
manifested
in
the
religious
institutions
of
all
nations
thus
led
to
the
conception
of
a
sort
of
universal
religion
containing
the
divine
elements
of
all
gnosticism
however
as
the
points
out
was
jewish
in
character
long
before
it
became
christian
matter
indicates
syria
and
palestine
as
its
cradle
and
alexandria
as
the
centre
by
which
it
was
influenced
at
the
time
of
its
alliance
with
christianity
this
influence
again
was
predominantly
jewish
philo
and
aristobulus
the
leading
jewish
philosophers
of
alexandria
wholly
attached
to
the
ancient
religion
of
their
fathers
both
resolved
to
adorn
it
with
the
spoils
of
other
systems
and
to
open
to
judaism
the
way
to
immense
conquests
this
method
of
borrowing
from
other
races
and
religions
those
ideas
useful
for
their
purpose
has
always
been
the
custom
of
the
jews
the
cabala
as
we
have
seen
was
made
up
of
these
heterogeneous
elements
and
it
is
here
we
find
the
principal
progenitor
of
gnosticism
the
freemason
ragon
gives
the
clue
in
the
words
the
cabala
is
the
key
of
the
occult
sciences
the
gnostics
were
born
of
the
cabalists
for
the
cabala
was
much
older
than
the
gnostics
modern
historians
who
date
it
merely
from
the
publication
of
the
zohar
by
moses
de
leon
in
the
thirteenth
century
or
from
the
school
of
luria
in
the
sixteenth
century
obscure
this
most
important
fact
which
jewish
savants
have
always
clearly
recognized
the
whilst
denying
the
certainty
of
connexion
between
gnosticism
and
the
cabala
nevertheless
admits
that
the
investigations
of
the
graetz
must
be
resumed
on
a
new
basis
and
it
goes
on
to
show
that
it
was
alexandria
of
the
first
century
or
earlier
with
her
strange
commingling
of
egyptian
chaldean
judean
and
greek
culture
which
furnished
soil
and
seeds
for
that
mystic
philosophy
but
since
alexandria
was
at
the
same
period
the
home
of
gnosticism
which
was
formed
from
the
same
elements
enumerated
here
the
connexion
between
the
two
systems
is
clearly
evident
matter
is
therefore
right
in
saying
that
gnosticism
was
not
a
defection
from
christianity
but
a
combination
of
systems
into
which
a
few
christian
elements
were
introduced
the
result
of
gnosticism
was
thus
not
to
christianize
the
cabala
but
to
cabalize
christianity
by
mingling
its
pure
and
simple
teaching
with
theosophy
and
even
magic
the
quotes
the
opinion
that
the
central
doctrine
of
gnosticism
a
movement
closely
connected
with
jewish
mysticism
was
nothing
else
than
the
attempt
to
liberate
the
soul
and
unite
it
with
god
but
as
this
was
apparently
to
be
effected
through
the
employment
of
mysteries
incantations
names
of
angels
it
will
be
seen
how
widely
even
this
phase
of
gnosticism
differs
from
christianity
and
identifies
itself
with
the
magical
cabala
of
the
jews
indeed
the
man
generally
recognized
as
the
founder
of
gnosticism
a
jew
commonly
known
as
simon
magus
was
not
only
a
cabalist
mystic
but
avowedly
a
magician
who
with
a
band
of
jews
including
his
master
dositheus
and
his
disciples
menander
and
cerinthus
instituted
a
priesthood
of
the
mysteries
and
practised
occult
arts
and
exorcisms
it
was
this
simon
of
whom
we
read
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
that
he
bewitched
the
people
of
samaria
giving
out
that
himself
was
some
great
one
to
whom
they
all
gave
heed
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
saying
this
man
is
the
great
power
of
god
and
who
sought
to
purchase
the
power
of
the
laying
on
of
hands
with
money
simon
indeed
crazed
by
his
incantations
and
ecstasies
developed
megalomania
in
an
acute
form
arrogating
to
himself
divine
honours
and
aspiring
to
the
adoration
of
the
whole
world
according
to
a
contemporary
legend
he
eventually
became
sorcerer
to
nero
and
ended
his
life
in
rome
the
prevalence
of
sorcery
amongst
the
jews
during
the
first
century
of
the
christian
era
is
shown
by
other
passages
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
in
paphos
the
false
prophet
a
jew
whose
surname
was
otherwise
known
as
elymas
the
sorcerer
opposed
the
teaching
of
paul
and
brought
on
himself
the
imprecation
o
full
of
all
subtlety
and
all
mischief
thou
child
of
the
devil
thou
enemy
of
all
righteousness
wilt
thou
not
cease
to
pervert
the
right
ways
of
the
lord
perversion
is
the
keynote
of
all
the
debased
forms
of
gnosticism
according
to
eliphas
lévi
certain
of
the
gnostics
introduced
into
their
rites
that
profanation
of
christian
mysteries
which
was
to
form
the
basis
of
black
magic
in
the
middle
ages
the
glorification
of
evil
which
plays
so
important
a
part
in
the
modern
revolutionary
movement
constituted
the
creed
of
the
ophites
who
worshipped
the
serpent
ὅφις
because
he
had
revolted
against
jehovah
to
whom
they
referred
under
the
cabalistic
term
of
the
demiurgus
and
still
more
of
the
cainites
from
their
cult
of
cain
whom
with
dathan
and
abiram
the
inhabitants
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
and
finally
judas
iscariot
they
regarded
as
noble
victims
of
the
demiurgus
animated
by
hatred
of
all
social
and
moral
order
the
cainites
called
upon
all
men
to
destroy
the
works
of
god
and
to
commit
every
kind
of
infamy
these
men
were
therefore
not
only
the
enemies
of
christianity
but
of
orthodox
judaism
since
it
was
against
the
jehovah
of
the
jews
that
their
hatred
was
particularly
directed
another
gnostic
sect
the
carpocratians
followers
of
carpocrates
of
alexandria
and
his
son
epiphanus
who
died
from
his
debaucheries
and
was
venerated
as
a
god
likewise
regarded
all
written
laws
christian
or
mosaic
with
contempt
and
recognized
only
the
γνῶσις
or
knowledge
given
to
the
great
men
of
every
nation
plato
and
pythagoras
moses
and
christ
which
frees
one
from
all
that
the
vulgar
call
religion
and
makes
man
equal
to
god
so
in
the
carpocratians
of
the
second
century
we
find
already
the
tendency
towards
that
of
which
forms
the
supreme
doctrine
of
the
secret
societies
and
of
the
visionary
socialists
of
our
day
the
war
now
begins
between
the
two
contending
principles
the
christian
conception
of
man
reaching
up
to
god
and
the
secret
society
conception
of
man
as
god
needing
no
revelation
from
on
high
and
no
guidance
but
the
law
of
his
own
nature
and
since
that
nature
is
in
itself
divine
all
that
springs
from
it
is
praiseworthy
and
those
acts
usually
regarded
as
sins
are
not
to
be
condemned
by
this
line
of
reasoning
the
carpocratians
arrived
at
much
the
same
conclusions
as
modern
communists
with
regard
to
the
ideal
social
system
thus
epiphanus
held
that
since
nature
herself
reveals
the
principle
of
the
community
and
the
unity
of
all
things
human
laws
which
are
contrary
to
this
law
of
nature
are
so
many
culpable
infractions
of
the
legitimate
order
of
things
before
these
laws
were
imposed
on
humanity
everything
was
in
common
land
goods
and
women
according
to
certain
contemporaries
the
carpocratians
returned
to
this
primitive
system
by
instituting
the
community
of
women
and
indulging
in
every
kind
of
licence
the
further
gnostic
sect
of
antitacts
following
this
same
cult
of
human
nature
taught
revolt
against
all
positive
religion
and
laws
and
the
necessity
for
gratifying
the
flesh
the
adamites
of
north
africa
going
a
step
further
in
the
return
to
nature
cast
off
all
clothing
at
their
religious
services
so
as
to
represent
the
primitive
innocence
of
the
garden
of
eden
a
precedent
followed
by
the
adamites
of
germany
in
the
fifteenth
century
these
gnostics
says
eliphas
lévi
under
the
pretext
of
spiritualizing
matter
materialized
the
spirit
in
the
most
revolting
ways
rebels
to
the
hierarchic
order
they
wished
to
substitute
the
mystical
licence
of
sensual
passions
to
wise
christian
sobriety
and
obedience
to
laws
enemies
of
the
family
they
wished
to
produce
sterility
by
increasing
debauchery
by
way
of
systematically
perverting
the
doctrines
of
the
christian
faith
the
gnostics
claimed
to
possess
the
true
versions
of
the
gospels
and
professed
belief
in
these
to
the
exclusion
of
all
the
others
thus
the
ebionites
had
their
own
corrupted
version
of
the
gospel
of
matthew
founded
on
the
gospel
of
the
hebrews
known
earlier
to
the
jewish
christians
the
marcosians
had
their
version
of
luke
the
cainites
their
own
gospel
of
judas
and
the
valentinians
their
gospel
of
st
john
as
we
shall
see
later
the
gospel
of
john
is
the
one
that
throughout
the
war
on
christianity
has
been
specially
chosen
for
the
purpose
of
perversion
of
course
this
spirit
of
perversion
was
nothing
new
many
centuries
earlier
the
prophet
isaiah
had
denounced
it
in
the
words
woe
unto
them
that
call
evil
good
and
good
evil
that
put
darkness
for
light
and
light
for
darkness
but
the
role
of
the
gnostics
was
to
reduce
perversion
to
a
system
by
binding
men
together
into
sects
working
under
the
guise
of
enlightenment
in
order
to
obscure
all
recognized
ideas
of
morality
and
religion
it
is
this
which
constitutes
their
importance
in
the
history
of
secret
societies
whether
the
gnostics
themselves
can
be
described
as
a
secret
society
or
rather
as
a
ramification
of
secret
societies
is
open
to
question
matter
quoting
a
number
of
writers
shows
the
possibility
that
they
had
mysteries
and
initiations
the
church
fathers
definitely
asserted
this
to
be
the
case
according
to
tertullian
the
valentinians
continued
or
rather
perverted
the
mysteries
of
eleusis
out
of
which
they
made
a
sanctuary
of
prostitution
the
valentinians
are
known
to
have
divided
their
members
into
three
classes
the
pneumatics
the
psychics
and
the
hylics
materialists
the
basilideans
are
also
said
to
have
possessed
secret
doctrines
known
to
hardly
one
in
a
thousand
of
the
sect
from
all
this
matter
concludes
that
the
gnostics
professed
to
hold
by
means
of
tradition
a
secret
doctrine
superior
to
that
contained
in
the
public
writings
of
the
apostles
that
they
did
not
communicate
this
doctrine
to
everyone
that
they
communicated
it
by
means
of
emblems
and
symbols
as
the
diagram
of
the
ophites
proves
that
in
these
communications
they
imitated
the
rites
and
trials
of
the
mysteries
of
eleusis
this
claim
to
the
possession
of
a
secret
oral
tradition
whether
known
under
the
name
of
γνῶσις
or
of
cabala
confirms
the
conception
of
the
gnostics
as
cabalists
and
shows
how
far
they
had
departed
from
christian
teaching
for
if
only
in
this
idea
of
one
doctrine
for
the
ignorant
and
another
for
the
initiated
the
gnostics
had
restored
the
very
system
which
christianity
had
come
to
destroy
manicheism
whilst
we
have
seen
the
gnostic
sects
working
for
more
or
less
subversive
purposes
under
the
guise
of
esoteric
doctrines
we
find
in
the
manicheans
of
persia
who
followed
a
century
later
a
sect
embodying
the
same
tendencies
and
approaching
still
nearer
to
secret
society
organization
cubricus
or
corbicius
the
founder
of
manicheism
was
born
in
babylonia
about
the
year
whilst
still
a
child
he
is
said
to
have
been
bought
as
a
slave
by
a
rich
widow
of
ctesiphon
who
liberated
him
and
on
her
death
left
him
great
wealth
according
to
another
story
for
the
whole
history
of
manes
rests
on
legends
he
inherited
from
a
rich
old
woman
the
books
of
a
saracen
named
scythianus
on
the
wisdom
of
the
egyptians
combining
the
doctrines
these
books
contained
with
ideas
borrowed
from
zoroastrianism
gnosticism
and
christianity
and
also
with
certain
additions
of
his
own
he
elaborated
a
philosophic
system
which
he
proceeded
to
teach
cubricus
then
changed
his
name
to
mani
or
manes
and
proclaimed
himself
the
paraclete
promised
by
jesus
christ
his
followers
were
divided
into
two
classes
the
outer
circle
of
hearers
or
combatants
and
the
inner
circle
of
teachers
or
ascetics
described
as
the
elect
as
evidence
of
their
resemblance
with
freemasons
it
has
been
said
that
the
manicheans
made
use
of
secret
signs
grips
and
passwords
that
owing
to
the
circumstances
of
their
master
adoption
they
called
manes
the
son
of
the
widow
and
themselves
the
children
of
the
widow
but
this
is
not
clearly
proved
one
of
their
customs
is
however
interesting
in
this
connexion
according
to
legend
manes
undertook
to
cure
the
son
of
the
king
of
persia
who
had
fallen
ill
but
the
prince
died
whereupon
manes
was
flayed
alive
by
order
of
the
king
and
his
corpse
hanged
up
at
the
city
gate
every
year
after
this
on
good
friday
the
manicheans
carried
out
a
mourning
ceremony
known
as
the
bema
around
the
catafalque
of
manes
whose
real
sufferings
they
were
wont
to
contrast
with
the
unreal
sufferings
of
christ
the
fundamental
doctrine
of
manicheism
is
dualism
that
is
to
say
the
existence
of
two
opposing
principles
in
the
world
light
and
darkness
good
and
evil
founded
however
not
on
the
christian
conception
of
this
idea
but
on
the
zoroastrian
conception
of
ormuzd
and
ahriman
and
so
perverted
and
mingled
with
cabalistic
superstitions
that
it
met
with
as
vehement
denunciation
by
persian
priests
as
by
christian
fathers
thus
according
to
the
doctrine
of
manes
all
matter
is
absolute
evil
the
principle
of
evil
is
eternal
humanity
itself
is
of
satanic
origin
and
the
first
human
beings
adam
and
eve
are
represented
as
the
offspring
of
devils
much
the
same
idea
may
be
found
in
the
jewish
cabala
where
it
is
said
that
adam
after
other
abominable
practices
cohabited
with
female
devils
whilst
eve
consoled
herself
with
male
devils
so
that
whole
races
of
demons
were
born
into
the
world
eve
is
also
accused
of
cohabiting
with
the
serpent
in
the
yalkut
shimoni
it
is
also
related
that
during
the
years
that
adam
lived
apart
from
eve
he
begat
a
generation
of
devils
spirits
and
hobgoblins
manichean
demonology
thus
paved
the
way
for
the
placation
of
the
powers
of
darkness
practised
by
the
euchites
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
century
and
later
by
the
paulicians
the
bogomils
and
the
luciferians
so
it
is
in
gnosticism
and
manicheism
that
we
find
evidence
of
the
first
attempts
to
pervert
christianity
the
very
fact
that
all
such
have
been
condemned
by
the
church
as
heresies
has
tended
to
enlist
sympathy
in
their
favour
yet
even
eliphas
lévi
recognizes
that
here
the
action
of
the
church
was
right
for
the
monstrous
gnosis
of
manes
was
a
desecration
not
only
of
christian
doctrines
but
of
sacred
traditions
the
revolt
against
islam
we
have
followed
the
efforts
of
subversive
sects
hitherto
directed
against
christianity
and
orthodox
judaism
we
shall
now
see
this
attempt
reduced
by
gradual
stages
to
a
working
system
of
extraordinary
efficiency
organized
for
the
purpose
of
undermining
all
moral
and
religious
beliefs
in
the
minds
of
moslems
in
the
middle
of
the
seventh
century
an
immense
schism
was
created
in
islam
by
the
rival
advocates
of
successors
to
the
prophet
the
orthodox
islamites
known
by
the
name
of
sunnis
adhering
to
the
elected
khalifas
abu
bakr
omar
and
othman
whilst
the
party
of
revolt
known
as
the
shiahs
claimed
the
khalifate
for
the
descendants
of
mohammed
through
ali
son
of
and
husband
of
fatima
the
prophet
daughter
this
division
ended
in
open
warfare
ali
was
finally
assassinated
his
elder
son
hason
was
poisoned
in
medina
his
younger
son
husain
fell
at
the
battle
of
kerbela
fighting
against
the
supporters
of
othman
the
deaths
of
hasan
and
husain
are
still
mourned
yearly
by
the
shiahs
at
the
moharram
the
ismailis
the
shiahs
themselves
split
again
over
the
question
of
ali
successors
into
four
factions
the
fourth
of
which
divided
again
into
two
further
sects
both
of
these
retained
their
allegiance
to
the
descendants
of
ali
as
far
as
but
whilst
one

no

had
ever
deviated

fundamental

merely
claimed

had
been
handed

line
from
that
recognized

the

the

party

about

time

death
of

still
remained

declaring

that

descended

was
not
dead
but
would
return
in
the
fullness
of

that
he
was
the
mahdi
whom
moslems
must
await
but
in
about
an
intriguer
of
extraordinary
subtlety
succeeded
in
capturing
the
movement
which
hitherto
merely
schismatic
now
became
definitely
subversive
not
only
of
islamism
but
of
all
religious
belief
this
man
abdullah
ibn
maymūn
the
son
of
a
learned
and
doctor
in
southern
persia
brought
up
in
the
doctrines
of
gnostic
dualism
and
profoundly
versed
in
all
religions
was
in
reality
like
his
father
a
pure
materialist
by
professing
adherence
to
the
creed
of
orthodox
and
proclaiming
a
knowledge
of
the
mystic
doctrines
which
the
ismailis
believed
to
have
descended
through
ismail
to
his
son
mohammed
abdullah
succeeded
in
placing
himself
at
the
head
of
the
ismailis
his
advocacy
of
ismail
was
thus
merely
a
mask
his
real
aim
being
materialism
which
he
now
proceeded
to
make
into
a
system
by
founding
a
sect
known
as
the
batinis
with
seven
degrees
of
initiation
dozy
has
given
the
following
description
of
this
amazing
project
to
link
together
into
one
body
the
vanquished
and
the
conquerors
to
unite
in
the
form
of
a
vast
secret
society
with
many
degrees
of
initiation
who
regarded
religion
only
as
a
curb
for
the
people
and
bigots
of
all
sects
to
make
tools
of
believers
in
order
to
give
power
to
sceptics
to
induce
conquerors
to
overturn
the
empires
they
had
founded
to
build
up
a
party
numerous
compact
and
disciplined
which
in
due
time
would
give
the
throne
if
not
to
himself
at
least
to
his
descendants
such
was
abdullah
ibn
maymūn
general
aim
an
extraordinary
conception
which
he
worked
out
with
marvellous
tact
incomparable
skill
and
a
profound
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
the
means
which
he
adopted
were
devised
with
diabolical
cunning
it
was
not
among
the
that
he
sought
his
true
supporters
but
among
the
ghebers
the
manicheans
the
pagans
of
harran
and
the
students
of
greek
philosophy
on
the
last
alone
could
he
rely
to
them
alone
could
he
gradually
unfold
the
final
mystery
and
reveal
that
imams
religions
and
morality
were
nothing
but
an
imposture
and
an
absurdity
the
rest
of
mankind
the
asses
as
abdullah
called
them
were
incapable
of
understanding
such
doctrines
but
to
gain
his
end
he
by
no
means
disdained
their
aid
on
the
contrary
he
solicited
it
but
he
took
care
to
initiate
devout
and
lowly
souls
only
in
the
first
grades
of
the
sect
his
missionaries
who
were
inculcated
with
the
idea
that
their
first
duty
was
to
conceal
their
true
sentiments
and
adapt
themselves
to
the
views
of
their
auditors
appeared
in
many
guises
and
spoke
as
it
were
in
a
different
language
to
each
class
they
won
over
the
ignorant
vulgar
by
feats
of
legerdemain
which
passed
for
miracles
or
excited
their
curiosity
by
enigmatical
discourse
in
the
presence
of
the
devout
they
assumed
the
mask
of
virtue
and
piety
with
mystics
they
were
mystical
and
unfolded
the
inner
meanings
of
phenomena
or
explained
allegories
and
the
figurative
sense
of
the
allegories
themselves
by
means
such
as
these
the
extraordinary
result
was
brought
about
that
a
multitude
of
men
of
diverse
beliefs
were
all
working
together
for
an
object
known
only
to
a
few
of
them
i
quote
this
passage
at
length
because
it
is
of
immense
importance
in
throwing
a
light
on
the
organization
of
modern
secret
societies
it
does
not
matter
what
the
end
may
be
whether
political
social
or
religious
the
system
remains
the
same
the
setting
in
motion
of
a
vast
number
of
people
and
making
them
work
in
a
cause
unknown
to
them
that
this
was
the
method
adopted
by
weishaupt
in
organizing
the
illuminati
and
that
it
came
to
him
from
the
east
will
be
shown
later
on
we
shall
now
see
how
the
system
of
the
philosopher
abdullah
paved
the
way
for
bloodshed
by
the
most
terrible
sect
the
world
had
ever
seen
the
karmathites
the
first
open
acts
of
violence
resulting
from
the
doctrines
of
abdullah
were
carried
out
by
the
karmathites
a
new
development
of
the
ismailis
amongst
the
many
dais
sent
out
by
the
leader
which
included
his
son
ahmed
and
ahmed
son
was
the
dai
hosein
ahwazi
abdullah
envoy
to
irak
in
persia
who
initiated
a
certain
hamdan
surnamed
karmath
into
the
secrets
of
the
sect
karmath
who
was
a
born
intriguer
and
believed
in
nothing
became
the
leader
of
the
karmathites
in
arabia
where
a
number
of
arabs
were
soon
enlisted
in
the
society
with
extraordinary
skill
he
succeeded
in
persuading
these
dupes
to
make
over
all
their
money
to
him
first
by
means
of
small
contributions
later
by
larger
sums
until
at
last
he
convinced
them
of
the
advantages
of
abolishing
all
private
property
and
establishing
the
system
of
the
community
of
goods
and
wives
this
principle
was
enforced
by
the
passage
of
the
koran
remember
the
grace
of
god
in
that
whilst
you
were
enemies
he
has
united
your
hearts
so
that
by
his
grace
you
have
become
brothers
de
sacy
thus
the
methods
employed
as
given
by
the
historian
nowairi
when
karmath
had
succeeded
in
establishing
all
this
and
everyone
had
agreed
to
conform
to
it
he
ordered
the
dais
to
assemble
all
the
women
on
a
certain
night
so
that
they
should
mingle
promiscuously
with
all
the
men
this
he
said
was
perfection
and
the
last
degree
of
friendship
and
fraternal
union
often
a
husband
led
his
wife
and
presented
her
himself
to
one
of
his
brothers
when
that
gave
him
pleasure
when
he
karmath
saw
that
he
had
become
absolute
master
of
their
minds
had
assured
himself
of
their
obedience
and
found
out
the
degree
of
their
intelligence
and
discernment
he
began
to
lead
them
quite
astray
he
put
before
them
arguments
borrowed
from
the
doctrines
of
the
dualists
they
fell
in
easily
with
all
that
he
proposed
and
then
he
took
away
from
them
all
religion
and
released
them
from
all
those
duties
of
piety
devotion
and
the
fear
of
god
that
he
prescribed
for
them
in
the
beginning
he
permitted
them
pillage
and
every
sort
of
immoral
licence
and
taught
them
to
throw
off
the
yoke
of
prayer
fasting
and
other
precepts
he
taught
them
that
they
were
held
by
no
obligations
and
that
they
could
pillage
the
goods
and
shed
the
blood
of
their
adversaries
with
impunity
that
the
knowledge
of
the
master
of
truth
to
whom
he
had
called
them
took
the
place
of
everything
else
and
that
with
this
knowledge
they
need
no
longer
fear
sin
or
punishment
as
the
result
of
these
teachings
the
karmathites
rapidly
became
a
band
of
brigands
pillaging
and
massacring
all
those
who
opposed
them
and
spreading
terror
throughout
all
the
surrounding
districts
peaceful
fraternity
was
thus
turned
into
a
wild
lust
for
conquest
the
karmathites
succeeded
in
dominating
a
great
part
of
arabia
and
the
mouth
of
the
euphrates
and
in
extended
their
ravages
westwards
they
took
possession
of
the
holy
city
of
mecca
in
the
defence
of
which
moslems
fell
for
a
whole
century
says
von
hammer
the
pernicious
doctrines
of
karmath
raged
with
fire
and
sword
in
the
very
bosom
of
islamism
until
the
widespread
conflagration
was
extinguished
in
blood
but
in
proclaiming
themselves
revolutionaries
the
karmathites
had
departed
from
the
plan
laid
down
by
the
originator
of
their
creed
abdullah
ibn
maymūn
which
had
consisted
not
in
acts
of
open
violence
but
in
a
secret
doctrine
which
should
lead
to
the
gradual
undermining
of
all
religious
faith
and
a
condition
of
mental
anarchy
rather
than
of
material
chaos
for
violence
as
always
had
produced
and
it
was
thus
that
while
the
karmathites
were
rushing
to
their
own
destruction
through
a
series
of
bloody
conflicts
another
branch
of
the
ismailis
were
quietly
reorganizing
their
forces
more
in
conformity
with
the
original
method
of
their
founder
these
were
the
fatimites
from
their
professed
belief
that
the
doctrine
of
the
prophet
had
descended
from
ali
husband
of
fatima
mohammed
daughter
whilst
less
extreme
than
the
karmathites
or
than
their
predecessor
abdullah
ibn
maymūn
the
fatimites
according
to
the
historian
makrizi
adopted
the
method
of
instilling
doubts
into
the
minds
of
believers
and
aimed
at
the
substitution
of
a
natural
for
a
revealed
religion
indeed
after
the
establishment
of
their
power
in
egypt
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
any
appreciable
degree
of
difference
in
the
character
of
their
teaching
from
the
anarchic
code
of
abdullah
and
his
more
violent
exponent
karmath
the
fatimites
the
founder
of
the
fatimite
dynasty
of
the
khalifas
was
one
ubeidallah
known
as
the
mahdi
accused
of
jewish
ancestry
by
his
adversaries
the
abbasides
who
declared
apparently
without
truth
that
he
was
the
son
or
grandson
of
ahmed
son
of
adbullah
ibn
maymūn
by
a
jewess
under
the
fourth
fatimite
khalifa
egypt
fell
into
the
power
of
the
dynasty
and
before
long
assemblages
of
both
men
and
women
known
as
societies
of
wisdom
were
instituted
in
cairo
in
these
acquired
a
greater
importance
by
the
establishment
of
the
dar
ul
hikmat
or
the
house
of
knowledge
by
the
sixth
khalifa
hakim
who
was
raised
to
a
deity
after
his
death
and
is
worshipped
to
this
day
by
the
druses
under
the
direction
of
the
dar
ul
hikmat
or
grand
lodge
of
cairo
the
fatimites
continued
the
plan
of
abdullah
ibn
maymūn
secret
society
with
the
addition
of
two
more
degrees
making
nine
in
all
their
method
of
enlisting
proselytes
and
system
of
initiation
which
as
claudio
jannet
points
out
are
absolutely
those
which
weishaupt
the
founder
of
the
prescribed
to
the
brothers
were
transcribed
by
the
historian
nowairi
in
a
description
that
may
be
briefly
summarized
thus
the
proselytes
were
broadly
divided
into
two
classes
the
learned
and
the
ignorant
the
dai
was
to
agree
with
the
former
applauding
his
wisdom
and
to
impress
the
latter
with
his
own
knowledge
by
asking
him
perplexing
questions
on
the
koran
thus
in
initiating
him
into
the
first
degree
the
dai
assumed
an
air
of
profundity
and
explained
that
religious
doctrines
were
too
abstruse
for
the
ordinary
mind
but
must
be
interpreted
by
men
who
like
the
dais
had
a
special
knowledge
of
this
science
the
initiate
was
bound
to
absolute
secrecy
concerning
the
truths
to
be
revealed
to
him
and
obliged
to
pay
in
advance
for
these
revelations
in
order
to
pique
his
curiosity
the
dai
would
suddenly
stop
short
in
the
middle
of
a
discourse
and
should
the
novice
finally
decline
to
pay
the
required
sum
he
was
left
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
which
inspired
him
with
the
desire
to
know
more
in
the
second
degree
the
initiate
was
persuaded
that
all
his
former
teachers
were
wrong
and
that
he
must
place
his
confidence
solely
in
those
imams
endowed
with
authority
from
god
in
the
third
he
learnt
that
these
imams
were
those
of
the
ismailis
seven
in
number
ending
with
mohammed
son
of
ismail
in
contradistinction
to
the
twelve
imams
of
the
imamias
who
supported
the
claims
of
ismail
brother
musa
in
the
fourth
he
was
told
that
the
prophets
preceding
the
imams
descending
from
ali
were
also
seven
in
number
namely
adam
noah
abraham
moses
jesus
the
first
mohammed
and
finally
mohammed
son
of
ismail
so
far
then
nothing
was
said
to
the
initiate
in
contradiction
to
the
broad
tenets
of
orthodox
islamism
but
with
the
fifth
degree
the
process
of
undermining
his
religion
began
he
was
now
told
to
reject
tradition
and
to
disregard
the
precepts
of
mohammed
in
the
sixth
he
was
taught
that
all
religious
observances
prayer
fasting
were
only
emblematic
that
in
fact
all
these
things
were
devices
to
keep
the
common
herd
of
men
in
subordination
in
the
seventh
the
doctrines
of
dualism
of
a
greater
and
a
lesser
deity
were
introduced
and
the
unity
of
god
fundamental
doctrine
of
islamism
was
destroyed
in
the
eighth
a
great
vagueness
was
expressed
on
the
attributes
of
the
first
and
greatest
of
these
deities
and
it
was
pointed
out
that
real
prophets
were
those
who
concerned
themselves
with
practical
matters
political
institutions
and
good
forms
of
government
finally
in
the
ninth
the
adept
was
shown
that
all
religious
teaching
was
allegorical
and
that
religious
precepts
need
only
be
observed
in
so
far
as
it
is
necessary
to
maintain
order
but
the
man
who
understands
the
truth
may
disregard
all
such
doctrines
abraham
moses
jesus
and
the
other
prophets
were
therefore
only
teachers
who
had
profited
by
the
lessons
of
philosophy
all
belief
in
revealed
religion
was
thus
destroyed
it
will
be
seen
then
that
in
the
last
degrees
the
whole
teaching
of
the
first
five
was
reversed
and
therefore
shown
to
be
a
fraud
fraud
in
fact
constituted
the
system
of
the
society
in
the
instructions
to
the
dais
every
artifice
is
described
for
enlisting
proselytes
by
misrepresentation
jews
were
to
be
won
by
speaking
ill
of
christians
christians
by
speaking
ill
of
jews
and
moslems
alike
sunnis
by
referring
with
respect
to
the
orthodox
khalifas
abu
bakr
and
omar
and
criticizing
ali
and
his
descendants
above
all
care
was
to
be
taken
not
to
put
before
proselytes
doctrines
that
might
revolt
them
but
to
make
them
advance
step
by
step
by
these
means
they
would
be
ready
to
obey
any
commands
as
the
instructions
express
it
if
you
were
to
give
the
order
to
whoever
it
might
be
to
take
from
him
all
that
he
holds
most
precious
above
all
his
money
he
would
oppose
none
of
your
orders
and
if
death
surprised
him
he
would
leave
you
all
that
he
possesses
in
his
will
and
make
you
his
heir
he
will
think
that
in
the
whole
world
he
can
not
find
a
man
more
worthy
than
you
such
was
the
great
secret
society
which
was
to
form
the
model
for
the
illuminati
of
the
eighteenth
century
to
whom
the
summary
of
von
hammer
might
with
equal
truth
apply
to
believe
nothing
and
to
dare
all
was
in
two
words
the
sum
of
this
system
which
annihilated
every
principle
of
religion
and
morality
and
had
no
other
object
than
to
execute
ambitious
designs
with
suitable
ministers
who
daring
all
and
knowing
nothing
since
they
consider
everything
a
cheat
and
nothing
forbidden
are
the
best
tools
of
an
infernal
policy
a
system
which
with
no
other
aim
than
the
gratification
of
an
insatiable
lust
for
domination
instead
of
seeking
the
highest
of
human
objects
precipitates
itself
into
the
abyss
and
mangling
itself
is
buried
amidst
the
ruins
of
thrones
and
altars
the
wreck
of
national
happiness
and
the
universal
execration
of
mankind
the
druses
the
terrible
grand
lodge
of
cairo
before
long
became
the
centre
of
a
new
and
extraordinary
cult
hakim
sixth
fatimite
khalifa
and
founder
of
the
dar
ul
hikmat
a
monster
of
tyranny
and
crime
whose
reign
can
only
be
compared
to
that
of
caligula
or
nero
was
now
raised
to
the
place
of
a
divinity
by
one
ismail
darazi
a
turk
who
in
announced
in
a
mosque
in
cairo
that
the
khalifa
should
be
made
an
object
of
worship
hakim
who
believed
that
divine
reason
was
incarnate
in
him
four
years
later
proclaimed
himself
a
deity
and
the
cult
was
finally
established
by
one
of
his
viziers
the
persian
mystic
hamza
ibn
ali
hakim
cruelties
however
had
so
outraged
the
people
of
egypt
that
a
year
later
he
was
murdered
by
a
band
of
malcontents
led
it
is
said
by
his
sister
who
afterwards
concealed
his
body
a
circumstance
which
gave
his
followers
the
opportunity
to
declare
that
the
divinity
had
merely
vanished
in
order
to
test
the
faith
of
believers
but
would
reappear
in
time
and
punish
apostates
this
belief
became
the
doctrine
of
the
druses
of
lebanon
whom
darazi
had
won
over
to
the
worship
of
hakim
it
is
unnecessary
to
enter
into
the
details
of
this
strange
religion
which
still
persists
in
the
range
of
lebanon
suffice
it
to
say
that
although
the
outcome
of
the
ismailis
the
druses
do
not
appear
to
have
embraced
the
materialism
of
abdullah
ibn
maymūn
but
to
have
grafted
on
a
primitive
form
of
and
of
sabeism
the
avowed
belief
of
the
ismailis
in
the
dynasty
of
ali
and
his
successors
and
beyond
this
an
abstruse
esoteric
creed
concerning
the
nature
of
the
supreme
deity
god
they
declare
to
be
universal
reason
who
manifests
himself
by
a
series
of
avatars
hakim
was
the
last
of
the
divine
embodiments
and
when
evil
and
misery
have
increased
to
the
predestined
height
he
will
again
appear
to
conquer
the
world
and
to
make
his
religion
supreme
it
is
however
as
a
secret
society
that
the
druses
enter
into
the
scope
of
this
book
for
their
organization
presents
several
analogies
with
that
which
we
now
know
as
masonic
instead
of
the
nine
degrees
instituted
by
the
lodge
of
cairo
the
druses
are
divided
into
only
three
profanes
aspirants
and
wise
to
whom
their
doctrines
are
gradually
unfolded
under
seal
of
the
strictest
secrecy
to
ensure
which
signs
and
passwords
are
employed
after
the
manner
of
freemasonry
a
certain
degree
of
duplicity
appears
to
enter
into
their
scheme
much
resembling
that
enjoined
to
the
ismaili
dais
when
enlisting
proselytes
belonging
to
other
religions
thus
in
talking
to
mohammedans
the
druses
profess
to
be
followers
of
the
prophet
with
christians
they
pretend
to
hold
the
doctrines
of
christianity
an
attitude
they
defend
on
the
score
that
it
is
unlawful
to
reveal
the
secret
dogmas
of
their
creed
to
a
black
or
unbeliever
the
druses
are
in
the
habit
of
holding
meetings
where
as
in
the
dar
ul
hikmat
both
men
and
women
assemble
and
religious
and
political
questions
are
discussed
the
uninitiated
however
are
allowed
to
exercise
no
influence
on
decisions
which
are
reached
by
the
inner
circle
to
which
only
the
wise
are
admitted
the
resemblance
between
this
organization
and
that
of
grand
orient
freemasonry
is
clearly
apparent
the
druses
also
have
modes
of
recognition
which
are
common
to
freemasonry
and
achille
laurent
has
observed
the
formula
or
catechism
of
the
druses
resembles
that
of
the
freemasons
one
can
learn
it
only
from
the
or
akels
intelligent
a
small
group
of
higher
initiates
who
only
reveal
its
mysteries
after
having
subjected
one
to
tests
and
made
one
take
terrible
oaths
i
shall
refer
again
later
in
this
book
to
the
affinity
between
the
druses
and
freemasons
of
the
grand
orient
the
assassins
it
will
be
seen
that
the
druses
distinguishing
themselves
from
other
ismaili
sects
by
their
worship
of
hakim
yet
retaining
genuine
religious
beliefs
had
not
carried
on
the
atheistical
tradition
of
abdullah
ibn
maymūn
and
of
the
grand
lodge
of
cairo
but
this
tradition
was
to
find
in
an
exponent
in
the
persian
hasan
saba
a
native
of
khorasan
the
son
of
ali
a
strict
shiah
who
finding
himself
suspected
of
heretical
ideas
ended
by
declaring
himself
a
sunni
hasan
brought
up
in
this
atmosphere
of
duplicity
was
therefore
well
fitted
to
play
the
machiavellian
rôle
of
an
ismaili
dai
von
hammer
regards
hasan
as
a
mighty
genius
one
of
a
splendid
triad
of
which
the
two
others
were
his
schoolfellows
the
poet
omar
khayyám
and
nizam
ul
mulk
grand
vizier
under
the
seljuk
sultan
malik
shah
hasan
having
through
the
protection
of
nizam
ul
mulk
secured
titles
and
revenues
and
finally
risen
to
office
at
the
court
of
the
sultan
attempted
to
supplant
his
benefactor
and
eventually
retired
in
disgrace
vowing
vengeance
against
the
sultan
and
vizier
at
this
juncture
he
encountered
several
ismailis
one
of
whom
a
dai
named
mumin
finally
converted
him
to
the
principles
of
his
sect
and
hasan
declaring
himself
now
to
be
a
convinced
adherent
of
the
fatimite
khalifas
journed
to
cairo
where
he
was
received
with
honour
by
the
dar
ul
hikmat
and
also
by
the
khalifa
mustansir
to
whom
he
became
counsellor
but
his
intrigues
once
more
involving
him
in
disgrace
he
fled
to
aleppo
and
laid
the
foundations
of
his
new
sect
after
enlisting
proselytes
in
bagdad
ispahan
khusistan
and
damaghan
he
succeeded
in
obtaining
by
strategy
the
fortress
of
alamut
in
persia
on
the
caspian
sea
where
he
completed
the
plans
for
his
great
secret
society
which
was
to
become
for
ever
infamous
under
the
name
of
the
hashishiyīn
or
under
the
pretence
of
belief
in
the
doctrines
of
islam
and
also
of
adherence
to
the
ismaili
line
of
succession
from
the
prophet
hasan
saba
now
set
out
to
pave
his
way
to
power
and
in
order
to
achieve
this
end
adopted
the
same
method
as
abdullah
ibn
maymūn
but
the
terrible
efficiency
of
hasan
society
consisted
in
the
fact
that
a
system
of
physical
force
was
now
organized
in
a
manner
undreamt
of
by
his
predecessor
as
von
hammer
has
observed
in
an
admirable
passage
opinions
are
powerless
so
long
as
they
only
confuse
the
brain
without
arming
the

scepticism
and
as
long
as
they
occupied
only
the
minds
of
the
indolent
and
philosophical
have
caused
the
ruin
of
no
throne
for
which
purpose
religious
and
political
fanaticism
are
the
strongest
levers
in
the
hands
of
nations
it
is
nothing
to
the
ambitious
man
what
people
believe
but
it
is
everything
to
know
how
he
may
turn
them
for
the
execution
of
his
projects
thus
as
in
the
case
of
the
french
revolution
whose
first
movers
von
hammer
also
observes
were
the
tools
or
leaders
of
secret
societies
it
was
not
mere
theory
but
the
method
of
enlisting
numerous
dupes
and
placing
weapons
in
their
hands
that
brought
about
the
terror
of
the
assassins
six
centuries
before
that
of
their
spiritual
descendants
the
jacobins
of
taking
as
his
groundwork
the
organization
of
the
grand
lodge
of
cairo
hasan
reduced
the
nine
degrees
to
their
original
number
of
seven
but
these
now
received
a
definite
nomenclature
and
included
not
only
real
initiates
but
active
agents
descending
downwards
the
degrees
of
the
assassins
were
thus
as
follows
first
the
grand
master
known
as
the
or
old
man
of
the
mountain
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
order
always
possessed
itself
of
castles
in
mountainous
regions
second
the
dail
kebir
or
grand
priors
third
the
fully
initiated
dais
religious
nuncios
and
political
emissaries
fourth
the
rafiqs
or
associates
in
training
for
the
higher
degrees
fifth
the
fadais
or
devoted
who
undertook
to
deliver
the
secret
blow
on
which
their
superiors
had
decided
sixth
the
lasiqus
or
law
brothers
and
lastly
the
common
people
who
were
to
be
simply
blind
instruments
if
the
equivalents
to
the
words
dai
rafiqs
and
fadais
given
by
von
hammer
and
bussell
as
master
masons
fellow
crafts
and
entered
apprentices
are
accepted
an
interesting
analogy
with
the
degrees
of
freemasonry
is
provided
designs
against
religion
were
of
course
not
admitted
by
the
order
strict
uniformity
to
islam
was
demanded
from
all
the
lower
rank
of
uninitiated
but
the
was
taught
to
see
through
the
deception
of
and
works
he
believed
in
nothing
and
recognized
that
all
acts
or
means
were
indifferent
and
the
secular
end
alone
to
be
considered
thus
the
final
object
was
domination
by
a
few
men
consumed
with
the
lust
of
power
under
the
cloak
of
religion
and
piety
and
the
method
by
which
this
was
to
be
established
was
the
wholesale
assassination
of
those
who
opposed
them
in
order
to
stimulate
the
energy
of
the
fadais
who
were
required
to
carry
out
these
crimes
the
superiors
of
the
order
had
recourse
to
an
ingenious
system
of
delusion
throughout
the
territory
occupied
by
the
assassins
were
exquisite
gardens
with
fruit
trees
bowers
of
roses
and
sparkling
streams
here
were
arranged
luxurious
with
persian
carpets
and
soft
divans
around
which
hovered
houris
bearing
wine
in
gold
and
silver
whilst
soft
music
mingled
with
the
murmuring
water
and
the
song
of
birds
the
young
man
whom
the
assassins
desired
to
train
for
a
career
of
crime
was
introduced
to
the
grand
master
of
the
order
and
intoxicated
with
haschisch
hence
the
name
hashishiyīn
applied
to
the
sect
from
which
the
word
assassin
is
derived
under
the
brief
spell
of
unconsciousness
induced
by
this
seductive
drug
the
prospective
fadai
was
then
carried
into
the
garden
where
on
awaking
he
believed
himself
to
be
in
paradise
after
enjoying
all
its
delights
he
was
given
a
fresh
dose
of
the
opiate
and
once
more
unconscious
was
transported
back
to
the
presence
of
the
grand
master
who
assured
him
that
he
had
never
left
his
side
but
had
merely
experienced
a
foretaste
of
the
paradise
that
awaited
him
if
he
obeyed
the
orders
of
his
chiefs
the
neophyte
thus
spurred
on
by
the
belief
that
he
was
carrying
out
the
commands
of
the
prophet
who
would
reward
him
with
eternal
bliss
eagerly
entered
into
the
schemes
laid
down
for
him
and
devoted
his
life
to
murder
thus
by
the
lure
of
paradise
the
assassins
enlisted
instruments
for
their
criminal
work
and
established
a
system
of
organized
murder
on
a
basis
of
religious
fervour
is
true
and
all
is
allowed
was
the
ground
of
their
secret
doctrine
which
however
being
imparted
but
to
few
and
concealed
under
the
veil
of
the
most
austere
religionism
and
piety
restrained
the
mind
under
the
yoke
of
blind
obedience
to
the
outside
world
all
this
remained
a
profound
mystery
fidelity
to
islam
was
proclaimed
as
the
fundamental
doctrine
of
the
sect
and
when
the
envoy
of
sultan
sajar
was
sent
to
collect
information
on
the
religious
beliefs
of
the
order
he
was
met
with
the
assurance
we
believe
in
the
unity
of
god
and
consider
that
only
as
true
wisdom
which
accords
with
his
word
and
the
commands
of
the
prophet
von
hammer
answering
the
possible
contention
that
as
in
the
case
of
the
templars
and
the
bavarian
illuminati
these
methods
of
deception
might
be
declared
a
calumny
on
the
order
points
out
that
in
the
case
of
the
assassins
no
possible
doubt
existed
for
their
secret
doctrines
were
eventually
revealed
by
the
leaders
themselves
first
by
hasan
ii
the
third
successor
of
hasan
saba
and
later
by
hasan
who
publicly
anathematized
the
founders
of
the
sect
and
ordered
the
burning
of
the
books
that
contained
their
designs
against
religion
a
proceeding
which
however
appears
to
have
been
a
strategical
manoeuvre
for
restoring
confidence
in
the
order
and
enabling
him
to
continue
the
work
of
subversion
and
crime
a
veritable
reign
of
terror
was
thus
established
throughout
the
east
the
rafiqs
and
fadais
spread
themselves
in
troops
over
the
whole
of
asia
and
darkened
the
face
of
the
earth
and
in
the
annals
of
the
assassins
is
found
the
chronological
enumeration
of
celebrated
men
of
all
nations
who
have
fallen
the
victims
of
the
ismailis
to
the
joy
of
their
murderers
and
the
sorrow
of
the
world
inevitably
this
long
and
systematic
indulgence
in
recoiled
on
the
heads
of
the
leaders
and
the
assassins
like
the
terrorists
of
france
ended
by
turning
on
each
other
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
himself
was
murdered
by
his
and
his
son
mohammed
mohammed
in
his
turn
whilst
aiming
at
the
life
of
his
son
was
anticipated
by
him
with
poison
which
murder
was
again
avenged
by
poison
so
that
from
hasan
the
illuminator
down
to
the
last
of
his
line
the
grand
masters
fell
by
the
hands
of
their
and
poison
and
the
dagger
prepared
the
grave
which
the
order
had
opened
for
so
many
finally
in
the
conquering
hordes
of
the
mongol
mangu
khan
swept
away
the
dynasty
of
the
assassins
but
although
as
reigning
powers
the
assassins
and
fatimites
ceased
to
exist
the
sects
from
which
they
derived
have
continued
up
to
the
present
day
still
every
year
at
the
celebration
of
the
moharram
the
shiahs
beat
their
breasts
and
besprinkle
themselves
with
blood
calling
aloud
on
the
martyred
heroes
hasan
and
husain
the
druses
of
the
lebanon
still
await
the
return
of
hakim
and
in
that
inscrutable
east
the
cradle
of
all
the
mysteries
the
profoundest
european
adept
of
secret
society
intrigue
may
find
himself
outdistanced
by
pastmasters
in
the
art
in
which
he
believed
himself
proficient
the
sect
of
hasan
saba
was
the
supreme
model
on
which
all
systems
of
organized
murder
working
through
fanaticism
such
as
the
carbonari
and
the
irish
republican
brotherhood
were
based
and
the
signs
the
symbols
the
initiations
of
the
grand
lodge
of
cairo
formed
the
groundwork
for
the
great
secret
societies
of
europe
how
came
this
system
to
be
transported
to
the
west
by
what
channel
did
the
ideas
of
these
succeeding
eastern
sects
penetrate
to
the
christian
world
in
order
to
answer
this
question
we
must
turn
to
the
history
of
the
crusades
the
templers
in
the
year
nineteen
years
after
the
first
crusade
had
ended
with
the
defeat
of
the
moslems
the
capture
of
antioch
and
jerusalem
and
the
instalment
of
godefroi
de
bouillon
as
king
of
the
latter
city
a
band
of
nine
french
led
by
hugues
de
payens
and
godefroi
de
formed
themselves
into
an
order
for
the
protection
of
pilgrims
to
the
holy
sepulchre
baldwin
ii
who
at
this
moment
succeeded
to
the
throne
of
jerusalem
presented
them
with
a
house
near
the
site
of
the
temple
of
solomon
hence
the
name
of
knights
templar
under
which
they
were
to
become
famous
in
the
order
was
sanctioned
by
the
council
of
troyes
and
by
the
pope
and
a
rule
was
drawn
up
by
bernard
under
which
the
knights
templar
were
bound
by
the
vows
of
poverty
chastity
and
obedience
but
although
the
templars
distinguished
themselves
by
many
deeds
of
valour
the
regulation
that
they
were
to
live
solely
on
alms
led
to
donations
so
enormous
that
abandoning
their
vow
of
poverty
they
spread
themselves
over
europe
and
by
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
had
become
a
rich
and
powerful
body
the
motto
that
the
order
had
inscribed
upon
its
banner
nobis
domine
sed
nomini
tuo
da
was
likewise
forgotten
for
their
faith
waxing
cold
they
gave
themselves
up
to
pride
and
ostentation
thus
as
an
masonic
writer
has
expressed
it
the
war
which
for
the
greater
number
of
warriors
of
good
faith
proved
the
source
of
weariness
of
losses
and
misfortunes
became
for
them
the
templars
only
the
opportunity
for
booty
and
aggrandizement
and
if
they
distinguished
themselves
by
a
few
brilliant
actions
their
motive
soon
ceased
to
be
a
matter
of
doubt
when
they
were
seen
to
enrich
themselves
even
with
the
spoils
of
the
confederates
to
increase
their
credit
by
the
extent
of
the
new
possessions
they
had
acquired
to
carry
arrogance
to
the
point
of
rivalling
crowned
princes
in
pomp
and
grandeur
to
refuse
their
aid
against
the
enemies
of
the
faith
as
the
history
of
saladin
testifies
and
finally
to
ally
themselves
with
that
horrible
and
sanguinary
prince
named
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
prince
of
the
assassins
the
truth
of
the
last
accusation
is
however
open
to
question
for
a
time
at
any
rate
the
templars
had
been
at
war
with
the
assassins
when
in
the
assassins
murdered
raymond
comte
de
tripoli
the
templars
entered
their
territory
and
forced
them
to
sign
a
treaty
by
which
they
were
to
pay
a
yearly
tribute
of
gold
pieces
in
expiation
of
the
crime
some
years
later
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
sent
an
ambassador
to
amaury
king
of
jerusalem
to
tell
him
privately
that
if
the
templars
would
forgo
the
payment
of
this
tribute
he
and
his
followers
would
embrace
the
christian
faith
amaury
accepted
offering
at
the
same
time
to
compensate
the
templars
but
some
of
the
knights
assassinated
the
ambassador
before
he
could
return
to
his
master
when
asked
for
reparations
the
grand
master
threw
the
blame
on
an
evil
knight
named
gautier
de
maisnil
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
relations
between
the
templars
and
the
assassins
were
at
first
far
from
amicable
nevertheless
it
appears
probable
that
later
on
an
understanding
was
brought
about
between
them
both
on
this
charge
and
on
that
of
treachery
towards
the
christian
armies
bussell
impartial
view
of
the
question
may
be
quoted
when
in
the
emperor
conrad
iii
failed
before
damascus
the
templars
were
believed
to
have
a
secret
understanding
with
the
garrison
of
that
city
in
they
were
said
to
have
sold
for
gold
pieces
a
prince
of
egypt
who
had
wished
to
become
a
christian
he
was
taken
home
to
suffer
certain
death
at
the
hands
of
his
fanatical
family
in
amaury
king
of
jerusalem
hanged
twelve
members
of
the
order
for
betraying
a
fortress
to
nureddin
and
bussell
goes
on
to
say
that
it
can
not
be
disputed
that
they
had
long
and
important
dealings
with
the
assassins
and
were
therefore
suspected
not
unfairly
of
imbibing
their
precepts
and
following
their
principles
by
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
templars
had
become
suspect
not
only
in
the
eyes
of
the
clergy
but
of
the
general
public
amongst
the
common
people
one
of
their
latest
apologists
admits
vague
rumours
circulated
they
talked
of
the
covetousness
and
want
of
scruple
of
the
knights
of
their
passion
for
aggrandizement
and
their
rapacity
their
haughty
insolence
was
proverbial
drinking
habits
were
attributed
to
them
the
saying
was
already
in
use
drink
like
a
templar
the
old
german
word
indicated
a
house
of
the
same
rumours
had
reached
clement
v
even
before
his
accession
to
the
papal
throne
in
and
in
this
same
year
he
summoned
the
grand
master
of
the
order
jacques
du
molay
to
return
to
france
from
the
island
of
cyprus
where
he
was
assembling
fresh
forces
to
avenge
the
recent
reverses
of
the
christian
armies
du
molay
arrived
in
france
with
sixty
other
knights
templar
and
gold
florins
as
well
as
a
large
quantity
of
silver
that
the
order
had
amassed
in
the
east
the
pope
now
set
himself
to
make
enquiries
concerning
the
charges
of
unspeakable
apostasy
against
god
detestable
idolatry
execrable
vice
and
many
heresies
that
had
been
secretly
intimated
to
him
but
to
quote
his
own
words
because
it
did
not
seem
likely
nor
credible
that
men
of
such
religion
who
were
believed
often
to
shed
their
blood
and
frequently
expose
their
persons
to
the
peril
of
death
for
christ
name
and
who
showed
such
great
and
many
signs
of
devotion
both
in
divine
offices
as
well
as
in
fasts
as
in
other
devotional
observances
should
be
so
forgetful
of
their
salvation
as
to
do
these
things
we
were
unwilling
to
give
ear
to
this
kind
of
insinuation
insinuacioni
ac
delacioni
ipsorum
aurem
noluimus
the
king
of
france
philippe
le
bel
who
had
hitherto
been
the
friend
of
the
templars
now
became
alarmed
and
urged
the
pope
to
take
action
against
them
but
before
the
pope
was
able
to
find
out
more
about
the
matter
the
king
took
the
law
into
his
own
hands
and
had
all
the
templars
in
france
arrested
on
october
the
following
charges
were
then
brought
against
them
by
the
inquisitor
for
france
before
whom
they
were
examined
the
ceremony
of
initiation
into
their
order
was
accompanied
by
insults
to
the
cross
the
denial
of
christ
and
gross
obscenities
the
adoration
of
an
idol
which
was
said
to
be
the
image
of
the
true
god
the
omission
of
the
words
of
consecration
at
mass
the
right
that
the
lay
chiefs
arrogated
to
themselves
of
giving
absolution
the
authorization
of
unnatural
vice
to
all
these
infamies
a
great
number
of
the
knights
including
jacques
du
molay
confessed
in
almost
precisely
the
same
terms
at
their
admission
into
the
order
they
said
they
had
been
shown
the
cross
on
which
was
the
figure
of
christ
and
had
been
asked
whether
they
believed
in
him
when
they
answered
yes
they
were
told
in
some
cases
that
this
was
wrong
sibi
quod
male
because
he
was
not
god
he
was
a
false
prophet
falsus
propheta
erat
nec
erat
some
added
that
they
were
then
shown
an
idol
or
a
bearded
head
which
they
were
told
to
worship
one
added
that
this
was
of
such
a
terrible
aspect
that
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
face
of
some
devil
called
in
french
and
that
whenever
he
saw
it
he
was
so
overcome
with
fear
that
he
could
hardly
look
at
it
without
fear
and
trembling
all
who
confessed
declared
that
they
had
been
ordered
to
spit
on
the
crucifix
and
very
many
that
they
had
received
the
injunction
to
commit
obscenities
and
to
practise
unnatural
vice
some
said
that
on
their
refusal
to
carry
out
these
orders
they
had
been
threatened
with
imprisonment
even
perpetual
imprisonment
a
few
said
they
had
actually
been
incarcerated
one
declared
that
he
had
been
terrorized
seized
by
the
throat
and
threatened
with
death
since
however
a
number
of
these
confessions
were
made
under
torture
it
is
more
important
to
consider
the
evidence
provided
by
the
trial
of
the
knights
at
the
hands
of
the
pope
where
this
method
was
not
employed
now
at
the
time
the
templars
were
arrested
clement
deeply
resenting
the
king
interference
with
an
order
which
existed
entirely
under
papal
jurisdiction
wrote
in
the
strongest
terms
of
remonstrance
to
philippe
le
bel
urging
their
release
and
even
after
their
trial
neither
the
confessions
of
the
knights
nor
the
angry
expostulations
of
the
king
could
persuade
him
to
believe
in
their
guilt
but
as
the
scandal
concerning
the
templars
was
increasing
he
consented
to
receive
in
private
audience
a
certain
knight
of
the
order
of
great
nobility
and
held
by
the
said
order
in
no
slight
esteem
who
testified
to
the
abominations
that
took
place
on
the
reception
of
the
brethren
the
spitting
on
the
cross
and
other
things
which
were
not
lawful
nor
humanly
speaking
decent
the
pope
then
decided
to
hold
an
examination
of
french
knights
at
poictiers
in
order
to
discover
whether
the
confessions
made
by
them
before
the
inquisitor
at
paris
could
be
substantiated
and
at
this
examination
conducted
without
torture
or
pressure
of
any
kind
in
the
presence
of
the
pope
himself
the
witnesses
declared
on
oath
that
they
would
tell
the
full
and
pure
truth
they
then
made
confessions
which
were
committed
to
writing
in
their
presence
and
these
being
afterwards
read
aloud
to
them
they
expressly
and
willingly
approved
them
in
illis
eas
expresse
et
sponte
prout
recitate
fuerunt
besides
this
an
examination
of
the
grand
master
jacques
du
molay
and
the
preceptors
of
the
order
was
held
in
the
presence
of
three
cardinals
and
four
public
notaries
and
many
other
good
men
these
witnesses
says
the
official
report
having
sworn
with
their
hands
on
the
gospel
of
god
sancta
dei
evangelia
ab
iis
corporaliter
that
they
would
on
all
the
aforesaid
things
speak
the
pure
and
full
truth
they
separately
freely
and
spontaneously
without
any
coercion
and
fear
deposed
and
confessed
among
other
things
the
denial
of
christ
and
spitting
upon
the
cross
when
they
were
received
into
the
order
of
the
temple
and
some
of
them
deposed
and
confessed
that
under
the
same
form
namely
with
denial
of
christ
and
spitting
on
the
cross
they
had
received
many
brothers
into
the
order
some
of
them
too
confessed
certain
other
horrible
and
disgusting
things
on
which
we
are
silent
besides
this
they
said
and
confessed
that
those
things
which
are
contained
in
the
confessions
and
depositions
of
heretical
depravity
which
they
made
lately
before
the
inquisitor
of
paris
were
true
their
confessions
being
again
committed
to
writing
were
approved
by
the
witnesses
who
then
with
bended
knees
and
many
tears
asked
for
and
obtained
absolution
the
pope
however
still
refused
to
take
action
against
the
whole
order
merely
because
the
master
and
brethren
around
him
had
gravely
sinned
and
it
was
decided
to
hold
a
papal
commission
in
paris
the
first
sitting
took
place
in
november
when
the
grand
master
and
knights
were
summoned
before
the
pontifical
commissioners
this
enquiry
says
michelet
was
conducted
slowly
with
much
consideration
and
gentleness
beaucoup
de
ménagement
et
de
by
high
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
an
archbishop
several
bishops
etc
but
although
a
number
of
the
knights
including
the
grand
master
now
retracted
their
admissions
some
damning
confessions
were
again
forthcoming
it
is
impossible
within
the
scope
of
this
book
to
follow
the
many
trials
of
the
templars
that
took
place
in
different
countries
in
italy
at
ravenna
pisa
bologna
and
florence
where
torture
was
not
employed
and
blasphemies
were
admitted
or
in
germany
where
torture
was
employed
but
no
confessions
were
made
and
a
verdict
was
given
in
favour
of
the
order
a
few
details
concerning
the
trial
in
england
may
however
be
of
interest
it
has
generally
been
held
that
torture
was
not
applied
in
england
owing
to
the
humanity
of
edward
ii
who
at
first
absolutely
refused
to
listen
to
any
accusations
against
the
order
on
december
he
had
written
to
the
pope
in
these
terms
and
because
the
said
master
or
brethren
constant
in
the
purity
of
the
catholic
faith
have
been
frequently
commended
by
us
and
by
all
our
kingdom
both
in
their
life
and
morals
we
are
unable
to
believe
in
suspicious
stories
of
this
kind
until
we
know
with
greater
certainty
about
these
things
we
therefore
pity
from
our
souls
the
suffering
and
losses
of
the
sd
master
and
brethren
which
they
suffer
in
consequence
of
such
infamy
and
we
supplicate
most
affectionately
your
sanctity
if
it
please
you
that
considering
with
favour
suited
to
the
good
character
of
the
master
and
brethren
you
may
deem
fit
to
meet
with
more
indulgence
the
detractions
calumnies
and
charges
by
certain
envious
and
evil
disposed
persons
who
endeavour
to
turn
their
good
deeds
into
works
of
perverseness
opposed
to
divine
teaching
until
the
said
charges
attributed
to
them
shall
have
been
brought
legally
before
you
or
your
representatives
here
and
more
fully
proved
edward
ii
also
wrote
in
the
same
terms
to
the
kings
of
portugal
castile
aragon
and
sicily
but
two
years
later
after
clement
v
had
himself
heard
the
confessions
of
the
order
and
a
papal
bull
had
been
issued
declaring
that
the
unspeakable
wickednesses
and
abominable
crimes
of
notorious
heresy
had
now
come
to
the
knowledge
of
almost
everyone
edward
ii
was
persuaded
to
arrest
the
templars
and
order
their
examination
according
to
castle
whose
interesting
treatise
we
quote
here
the
king
would
not
allow
torture
to
be
employed
with
the
result
that
the
knights
denied
all
charges
but
later
it
is
said
he
allowed
himself
to
be
overpersuaded
and
torture
appears
to
have
been
applied
on
one
or
two
occasions
with
the
result
that
three
knights
confessed
to
all
and
were
given
absolution
at
southwark
however
a
considerable
number
of
brethren
admitted
that
they
had
been
strongly
accused
of
the
crimes
of
negation
and
spitting
they
did
not
say
they
were
guilty
but
that
they
could
not
purge
themselves
and
therefore
they
abjured
these
and
all
other
heresies
evidence
was
also
given
against
the
order
by
outside
witnesses
and
the
same
stories
of
intimidation
at
the
ceremony
of
reception
were
told
at
any
rate
the
result
of
the
investigation
was
not
altogether
satisfactory
and
the
templars
were
finally
suppressed
in
england
as
elsewhere
by
the
council
of
vienne
in
in
france
more
rigorous
measures
were
adopted
and
knights
who
had
retracted
their
confessions
were
burnt
at
the
stake
as
relapsed
heretics
on
may
four
years
later
on
march
the
grand
master
jacques
du
molay
suffered
the
same
fate
now
however
much
we
must
execrate
the
barbarity
of
this
sentence
as
also
the
cruelties
that
had
preceded
it
this
is
no
reason
why
we
should
admit
the
claim
of
the
order
to
noble
martyrdom
put
forward
by
the
historians
who
have
espoused
their
cause
the
character
of
the
templars
is
not
rehabilitated
by
condemning
the
conduct
of
the
king
and
pope
yet
this
is
the
line
of
argument
usually
adopted
by
the
defenders
of
the
order
thus
the
two
main
contentions
on
which
they
base
their
defence
are
firstly
that
the
confessions
of
the
knights
were
made
under
torture
therefore
they
must
be
regarded
as
null
and
void
and
secondly
that
the
whole
affair
was
a
plot
concerted
between
the
king
and
pope
in
order
to
obtain
possession
of
the
templars
riches
let
us
examine
these
contentions
in
turn
in
the
first
place
as
we
have
seen
all
confessions
were
not
made
under
torture
no
one
as
far
as
i
am
aware
disputes
michelet
assertion
that
the
enquiry
before
the
papal
commission
in
paris
at
which
a
number
of
knights
adhered
to
the
statements
they
had
made
to
the
pope
was
conducted
without
pressure
of
any
kind
but
further
the
fact
that
confessions
are
made
under
torture
does
not
necessarily
invalidate
them
as
evidence
guy
fawkes
also
confessed
under
torture
yet
it
is
never
suggested
that
the
whole
story
of
the
gunpowder
plot
was
a
myth
torture
however
much
we
may
condemn
it
has
frequently
proved
the
only
method
for
overcoming
the
intimidation
exercised
over
the
mind
of
a
conspirator
a
man
bound
by
the
terrible
obligations
of
a
confederacy
and
fearing
the
vengeance
of
his
will
not
readily
yield
to
persuasion
but
only
to
force
if
then
some
of
the
templars
were
terrorized
by
torture
or
even
by
the
fear
of
torture
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
terrorism
was
exercised
by
both
sides
few
will
deny
that
the
knights
were
bound
by
oaths
of
secrecy
so
that
on
one
hand
they
were
threatened
with
the
vengeance
of
the
order
if
they
betrayed
its
secrets
and
on
the
other
faced
with
torture
if
they
refused
to
confess
thus
they
found
themselves
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
it
was
therefore
not
a
case
of
a
mild
and
unoffending
order
meeting
with
brutal
treatment
at
the
hands
of
authority
but
of
the
victims
of
a
terrible
autocracy
being
delivered
into
the
hands
of
another
autocracy
moreover
do
the
confessions
of
the
knights
appear
to
be
the
outcome
of
pure
imagination
such
as
men
under
the
influence
of
torture
might
devise
it
is
certainly
difficult
to
believe
that
the
accounts
of
the
ceremony
of
initiation
given
in
detail
by
men
in
different
countries
all
closely
resembling
each
other
yet
related
in
different
phraseology
could
be
pure
inventions
had
the
victims
been
driven
to
invent
they
would
surely
have
contradicted
each
other
have
cried
out
in
their
agony
that
all
kinds
of
wild
and
fantastic
rites
had
taken
place
in
order
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
their
interlocutors
but
no
each
appears
to
be
describing
the
same
ceremony
more
or
less
completely
with
characteristic
touches
that
indicate
the
personality
of
the
speaker
and
in
the
main
all
the
stories
tally
the
further
contention
that
the
case
against
the
templars
was
manufactured
by
the
king
and
pope
with
a
view
to
obtaining
their
wealth
is
entirely
disproved
by
facts
the
latest
french
historian
of
mediæval
france
whilst
expressing
disbelief
in
the
guilt
of
the
templars
characterizes
this
as
puerile
philippe
le
bel
writes
has
never
been
understood
from
the
beginning
people
have
not
been
just
to
him
this
young
prince
was
one
of
the
greatest
kings
and
the
noblest
characters
that
have
appeared
in
history
without
carrying
appreciation
so
far
one
must
nevertheless
accord
to
statement
of
facts
the
attention
it
merits
philippe
has
been
blamed
for
debasing
the
coin
of
the
realm
in
reality
he
merely
ordered
it
to
be
mixed
with
alloy
as
a
necessary
measure
after
the
war
with
england
precisely
as
own
coinage
was
debased
in
consequence
of
the
recent
war
this
was
done
quite
openly
and
the
coinage
was
restored
at
the
earliest
opportunity
intensely
national
his
policy
of
attacking
the
lombards
exiling
the
jews
and
suppressing
the
templars
however
regrettable
the
methods
by
which
it
was
carried
out
resulted
in
immense
benefits
to
france
has
graphically
described
the
prosperity
of
the
whole
country
during
the
early
fourteenth
century
the
increase
of
population
flourishing
agriculture
and
industry
in
provence
and
languedoc
one
meets
swineherds
who
have
vineyards
simple
cowherds
who
have
town
houses
the
attitude
of
philippe
le
bel
towards
the
templars
must
be
viewed
in
this
light
ruthless
suppression
of
any
body
of
people
who
interfered
with
the
prosperity
of
france
his
action
was
not
that
of
arbitrary
authority
he
proceeded
says
by
means
of
an
appeal
to
the
people
in
his
name
nogaret
the
chancellor
spoke
to
the
parisians
in
the
garden
of
the
palace
october
popular
assemblies
were
convoked
all
over
france
the
parliament
of
tours
with
hardly
a
dissentient
vote
declared
the
templars
worthy
of
death
the
university
of
paris
gave
the
weight
of
their
judgement
as
to
the
fullness
and
authenticity
of
the
confessions
even
assuming
that
these
bodies
were
actuated
by
the
same
servility
as
that
which
has
been
attributed
to
the
pope
how
are
we
to
explain
the
fact
that
the
trial
of
the
order
aroused
no
opposition
among
the
far
from
docile
people
of
paris
if
the
templars
had
indeed
as
they
professed
been
leading
noble
and
upright
lives
devoting
themselves
to
the
care
of
the
poor
one
might
surely
expect
their
arrest
to
be
followed
by
popular
risings
but
there
appears
to
have
been
no
sign
of
this
as
to
the
pope
we
have
already
seen
that
from
the
outset
he
had
shown
himself
extremely
reluctant
to
condemn
the
order
and
no
satisfactory
explanation
is
given
of
his
change
of
attitude
except
that
he
wished
to
please
the
king
as
far
as
his
own
interests
were
concerned
it
is
obvious
that
he
could
have
nothing
to
gain
by
publishing
to
the
world
a
scandal
that
must
inevitably
bring
opprobrium
on
the
church
his
lamentations
to
this
effect
in
the
famous
bull
clearly
show
that
he
recognized
this
danger
and
therefore
desired
at
all
costs
to
clear
the
accused
knights
if
evidence
could
be
obtained
in
their
favour
it
was
only
when
the
templars
made
damning
admissions
in
his
presence
that
he
was
obliged
to
abandon
their
defence
yet
we
are
told
that
he
did
this
out
of
base
compliance
with
the
wishes
of
philippe
le
bel
philippe
le
bell
is
thus
represented
as
the
of
the
whole
piece
through
seven
long
years
hounding
down
a
blameless
order
from
whom
up
to
the
very
moment
of
their
arrest
he
had
repeatedly
received
loans
of
money
solely
with
the
object
of
appropriating
their
wealth
yet
after
all
we
find
that
the
property
of
the
templars
was
not
appropriated
by
the
king
but
was
given
by
him
to
the
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
what
was
the
fate
of
the
templars
goods
philippe
le
bel
decided
that
they
should
be
handed
over
to
the
hospitallers
clement
v
states
that
the
orders
given
by
the
king
on
this
subject
were
executed
even
the
domain
of
the
temple
in
paris
up
to
the
eve
of
the
revolution
was
the
property
of
the
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
the
royal
treasury
kept
for
itself
certain
sums
for
the
costs
of
the
trial
these
had
been
immense
these
facts
in
no
way
daunt
the
antagonists
of
philippe
who
we
are
now
assured
again
without
any
proof
whatever
was
overruled
by
the
pope
in
this
matter
but
setting
all
morality
aside
as
a
mere
question
of
policy
is
it
likely
that
the
king
would
have
deprived
himself
of
his
most
valuable
financial
supporters
and
gone
to
the
immense
trouble
of
bringing
them
to
trial
without
first
assuring
himself
that
he
would
benefit
by
the
affair
would
he
in
other
words
have
killed
the
goose
that
laid
the
golden
eggs
without
any
guarantee
that
the
body
of
the
goose
would
remain
in
his
possession
again
if
as
we
are
told
the
pope
suppressed
the
order
so
as
to
please
the
king
why
should
he
have
thwarted
him
over
the
whole
purpose
the
king
had
in
view
might
we
not
expect
indignant
remonstrances
from
philippe
at
thus
being
baulked
of
the
booty
he
had
toiled
so
long
to
gain
but
on
the
contrary
we
find
him
completely
in
agreement
with
the
pope
on
this
subject
in
november
clement
v
distinctly
stated
that
philippe
the
illustrious
king
of
france
to
whom
the
facts
concerning
the
templars
had
been
told
was
not
prompted
by
avarice
since
he
desired
to
keep
or
appropriate
for
himself
no
part
of
the
property
of
the
templars
but
liberally
and
devotedly
left
them
to
us
and
the
church
to
be
administered
etc
thus
the
whole
theory
concerning
the
object
for
which
the
templars
were
suppressed
falls
to
the
ground
a
theory
which
on
examination
is
seen
to
be
built
up
entirely
on
the
plan
of
imputing
motives
without
any
justification
in
facts
the
king
acted
from
cupidity
the
pope
from
servility
and
the
templars
confessed
from
fear
of
torture
on
these
pure
hypotheses
defenders
of
the
order
base
their
arguments
the
truth
is
far
more
probably
that
if
the
king
had
any
additional
reason
for
suppressing
the
templars
it
was
not
envy
of
their
wealth
but
fear
of
the
immense
power
their
wealth
conferred
the
order
dared
even
to
defy
the
king
and
to
refuse
to
pay
taxes
the
temple
in
fact
constituted
an
in
that
threatened
not
only
the
royal
authority
but
the
whole
social
system
an
important
light
is
thrown
on
the
situation
by
in
this
passage
as
the
templars
had
houses
in
all
countries
they
practised
the
financial
operations
of
the
international
banks
of
our
times
they
were
acquainted
with
letters
of
change
orders
payable
at
sight
they
instituted
dividends
and
annuities
on
deposited
capital
advanced
funds
lent
on
credit
controlled
private
accounts
undertook
to
raise
taxes
for
the
lay
and
ecclesiastical
seigneurs
through
their
proficiency
in
these
matters
acquired
very
possibly
from
the
jews
of
alexandria
whom
they
must
have
met
in
the
east
the
templars
had
become
the
international
financiers
and
international
capitalists
of
their
day
had
they
not
been
suppressed
all
the
evils
now
denounced
by
socialists
as
peculiar
to
the
system
they
describe
as
capitalism
trusts
monopolies
and
corners
would
in
all
probability
have
been
inaugurated
during
the
course
of
the
fourteenth
century
in
a
far
worse
form
than
at
the
present
day
since
no
legislation
existed
to
protect
the
community
at
large
the
feudal
system
as
marx
and
engels
perceived
was
the
principal
obstacle
to
exploitation
by
a
financial
autocracy
moreover
it
is
by
no
means
improbable
that
this
order
of
things
would
have
been
brought
about
by
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
french
monarchy
indeed
of
all
monarchies
the
templars
those
terrible
conspirators
says
eliphas
lévi
threatened
the
whole
world
with
an
immense
revolution
here
perhaps
we
may
find
the
reason
why
this
band
of
dissolute
and
rapacious
nobles
has
enlisted
the
passionate
sympathy
of
democratic
writers
for
it
will
be
noticed
that
these
same
writers
who
attribute
the
king
condemnation
of
the
order
to
envy
of
their
wealth
never
apply
this
argument
to
the
demagogues
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
suggest
that
their
accusations
against
the
nobles
of
france
were
inspired
by
cupidity
nor
would
they
ever
admit
that
any
such
motive
may
enter
into
the
diatribes
against
private
owners
of
wealth
the
templars
thus
remain
the
only
body
of
capitalists
with
the
exception
of
the
jews
to
be
not
only
pardoned
for
their
riches
but
exalted
as
noble
victims
of
prejudice
and
envy
is
it
merely
because
the
templars
were
the
enemies
of
monarchy
or
is
it
that
the
world
revolution
whilst
attacking
private
owners
of
property
has
never
been
opposed
to
international
finance
particularly
when
combined
with
tendencies
it
is
the
continued
defence
of
the
templars
which
to
the
present
writer
appears
the
most
convincing
evidence
against
them
for
even
if
one
believes
them
innocent
of
the
crimes
laid
to
their
charge
how
is
it
possible
to
admire
them
in
their
later
stages
the
fact
that
can
not
be
denied
is
that
they
were
false
to
their
obligations
that
they
took
the
vow
of
poverty
and
then
grew
not
only
rich
but
arrogant
that
they
took
the
vow
of
chastity
and
became
notoriously
immoral
are
all
these
things
then
condoned
because
the
templars
formed
a
link
in
the
chain
of
world
revolution
at
this
distance
of
time
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
templars
will
probably
never
be
conclusively
established
either
way
on
the
mass
of
conflicting
evidence
bequeathed
to
us
by
history
no
one
can
pronounce
a
final
judgement
without
attempting
to
digmatize
on
the
question
i
would
suggest
that
the
real
truth
may
be
that
the
knights
were
both
innocent
and
guilty
that
is
to
say
that
a
certain
number
were
initiated
into
the
secret
doctrine
of
the
order
whilst
the
majority
remained
throughout
in
ignorance
thus
according
to
the
evidence
of
stephen
de
stapelbrugge
an
english
knight
there
were
two
modes
of
reception
one
lawful
and
good
and
the
other
contrary
to
the
faith
this
would
account
for
the
fact
that
some
of
the
accused
declined
to
confess
even
under
the
greatest
pressure
these
may
really
have
known
nothing
of
the
real
doctrines
of
the
order
which
were
confided
orally
only
to
those
whom
the
superiors
regarded
as
unlikely
to
be
revolted
by
them
such
have
always
been
the
methods
of
secret
societies
from
the
ismailis
onward
this
theory
of
a
double
doctrine
is
put
forward
by
loiseleur
who
observes
if
we
consult
the
statutes
of
the
order
of
the
temple
as
they
have
come
down
to
us
we
shall
certainly
discover
there
is
nothing
that
justifies
the
strange
and
abominable
practices
revealed
at
the
inquiry
but
besides
the
public
rule
had
not
the
order
another
one
whether
traditional
or
written
authorizing
or
even
prescribing
these
practices
a
secret
rule
revealed
only
to
the
initiates
eliphas
lévi
also
exonerates
the
majority
of
the
templars
from
complicity
in
either
or
designs
these
tendencies
were
enveloped
in
profound
mystery
and
the
order
made
an
outward
profession
of
the
most
perfect
orthodoxy
the
chiefs
alone
knew
whither
they
were
going
the
rest
followed
unsuspectingly
what
then
was
the
templar
heresy
on
this
point
we
find
a
variety
of
opinions
according
to
wilcke
ranke
and
weber
it
was
the
unitarian
deism
of
islam
lecouteulx
de
canteleu
thinks
however
it
was
derived
from
heretical
islamic
sources
and
relates
that
whilst
in
palestine
one
of
the
knights
guillaume
de
montbard
was
initiated
by
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
in
a
cave
of
mount
lebanon
that
a
certain
resemblance
existed
between
the
templars
and
the
assassins
has
been
indicated
by
von
hammer
and
further
emphasized
by
the
freemason
clavel
oriental
historians
show
us
at
different
periods
the
order
of
the
templars
maintaining
intimate
relations
with
that
of
the
assassins
and
they
insist
on
the
affinity
that
existed
between
the
two
associations
they
remark
that
they
had
adopted
the
same
colours
white
and
red
that
they
had
the
same
organization
the
same
hierarchy
of
degrees
those
of
fedavi
refik
and
dai
in
one
corresponding
to
those
of
novice
professed
and
knight
in
the
other
that
both
conspired
for
the
ruin
of
the
religions
they
professed
in
public
and
that
finally
both
possessed
numerous
castles
the
former
in
asia
the
latter
in
europe
but
in
spite
of
these
outward
resemblances
it
does
not
appear
from
the
confessions
of
the
knights
that
the
secret
doctrine
of
the
templars
was
that
of
the
assassins
or
of
any
ismaili
sect
by
which
in
accordance
with
orthodox
islamism
jesus
was
openly
held
up
as
a
prophet
although
secretly
indifference
to
all
religion
was
inculcated
the
templars
as
far
as
can
be
discovered
were
deists
loiseleur
considers
that
their
ideas
were
derived
from
gnostic
or
manichean
dualists
cathari
paulicians
or
more
particularly
bogomils
of
which
a
brief
account
must
be
given
here
the
who
flourished
about
the
seventh
century
bore
a
resemblance
to
the
cainites
and
ophites
in
their
detestation
of
the
demiurgus
and
in
the
corruption
of
their
morals
later
in
the
ninth
century
the
whose
name
signifies
in
slavonic
friends
of
god
and
who
had
migrated
from
northern
syria
and
mesopotamia
to
the
balkan
peninsula
particularly
thrace
appeared
as
a
further
development
of
manichean
dualism
their
doctrine
may
be
summarized
thus
god
the
supreme
father
has
two
sons
the
elder
satanael
the
younger
jesus
to
satanael
who
sat
on
the
right
hand
of
god
belonged
the
right
of
governing
the
celestial
world
but
filled
with
pride
he
rebelled
against
his
father
and
fell
from
heaven
then
aided
by
the
companions
of
his
fall
he
created
the
visible
world
image
of
the
celestial
having
like
the
other
its
sun
moon
and
stars
and
last
he
created
man
and
the
serpent
which
became
his
minister
later
christ
came
to
earth
in
order
to
show
men
the
way
to
heaven
but
his
death
was
ineffectual
for
even
by
descending
into
hell
he
could
not
wrest
the
power
from
satanael
satan
this
belief
in
the
impotence
of
christ
and
the
necessity
therefore
for
placating
satan
not
only
the
prince
of
this
world
but
its
creator
led
to
the
further
doctrine
that
satan
being
should
be
adored
nicetas
choniates
a
byzantine
historian
of
the
twelfth
century
described
the
followers
of
this
cult
as
satanists
because
considering
satan
powerful
they
worshipped
him
lest
he
might
do
them
harm
subsequently
they
were
known
as
luciferians
their
doctrine
as
stated
by
neuss
and
vitoduranus
being
that
lucifer
was
unjustly
driven
out
of
heaven
that
one
day
he
will
ascend
there
again
and
be
restored
to
his
former
glory
and
power
in
the
celestial
world
the
bogomils
and
luciferians
were
thus
closely
akin
but
whilst
the
former
divided
their
worship
between
god
and
his
two
sons
the
latter
worshipped
lucifer
only
regarding
the
material
world
as
his
work
and
holding
that
by
indulging
the
flesh
they
were
propitiating
their
it
was
said
that
a
black
cat
the
symbol
of
satan
figured
in
their
ceremonies
as
an
object
of
worship
also
that
at
their
horrible
nocturnal
orgies
sacrifices
of
children
were
made
and
their
blood
used
for
making
the
eucharistic
bread
of
the
sect
thus
the
templars
recognize
at
the
same
time
a
good
god
incommunicable
to
man
and
consequently
without
symbolic
representation
and
a
bad
god
to
whom
they
give
the
features
of
an
idol
of
fearful
aspect
their
most
fervent
worship
was
addressed
to
this
god
of
evil
who
alone
could
enrich
them
they
said
with
the
luciferians
elder
son
of
god
satanael
or
lucifer
alone
has
a
right
to
the
homage
of
mortals
jesus
his
younger
brother
does
not
deserve
this
honour
although
we
shall
not
find
these
ideas
so
clearly
defined
in
the
confessions
of
the
knights
some
colour
is
lent
to
this
theory
by
those
who
related
that
the
reason
given
to
them
for
not
believing
in
christ
was
that
he
was
nothing
he
was
a
false
prophet
and
of
no
value
and
that
they
should
believe
in
the
higher
god
of
heaven
who
could
save
them
according
to
loiseleur
the
idol
they
were
taught
to
worship
the
bearded
head
known
to
history
as
baphomet
represented
the
inferior
god
organizer
and
dominator
of
the
material
world
author
of
good
and
evil
here
below
him
by
whom
evil
was
introduced
into
creation
the
etymology
of
the
word
baphomet
is
difficult
to
discover
raynouard
says
it
originated
with
two
witnesses
heard
at
carcassonne
who
spoke
of
figura
baflometi
and
suggests
that
it
was
a
corruption
of
mohammed
whom
the
inquisitors
wished
to
make
the
knights
confess
they
were
taught
to
adore
but
this
surmise
with
regard
to
the
intentions
of
the
inquisitors
seems
highly
improbable
since
they
must
have
been
well
aware
that
as
wilcke
points
out
the
moslems
forbid
all
idols
for
this
reason
wilcke
concludes
that
the
mohammedanism
of
the
templars
was
combined
with
cabalism
and
that
their
idol
was
in
reality
the
or
head
of
the
ancient
of
ancients
represented
as
an
old
man
with
a
long
beard
or
sometimes
as
three
heads
in
one
which
has
already
been
referred
to
under
the
name
of
the
long
face
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
book
a
theory
which
would
agree
with
eliphas
assertion
that
the
templars
were
initiated
into
the
mysterious
doctrines
of
the
cabala
but
lévi
goes
on
to
define
this
teaching
under
the
name
of
johannism
it
is
here
that
we
reach
a
further
theory
with
regard
to
the
secret
doctrine
of
the
templars
the
most
important
of
all
since
it
emanates
from
masonic
and
sources
thus
effectually
disposing
of
the
contention
that
the
charge
brought
against
the
order
of
apostasy
from
the
catholic
faith
is
solely
the
invention
of
catholic
writers
in
the
freemason
ragon
related
that
the
templars
learnt
from
the
initiates
of
the
east
a
certain
judaic
doctrine
which
was
attributed
to
john
the
apostle
therefore
they
renounced
the
religion
of
peter
and
became
johannites
eliphas
lévi
expresses
the
same
opinion
now
these
statements
are
apparently
founded
on
a
legend
which
was
first
published
early
in
the
nineteenth
century
when
an
association
calling
itself
the
du
and
claiming
direct
descent
from
the
original
templar
order
published
two
works
the
des
chevaliers
de
du
in
and
the
in
together
with
a
version
of
the
gospel
of
john
differing
from
the
vulgate
these
books
which
appear
to
have
been
printed
only
for
private
circulation
amongst
the
members
and
are
now
extremely
rare
relate
that
the
order
of
the
temple
had
never
ceased
to
exist
since
the
days
of
jacques
du
molay
who
appointed
jacques
de
larménie
his
successor
in
office
and
from
that
time
onwards
a
line
of
grand
masters
had
succeeded
each
other
without
a
break
up
to
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
it
ceased
for
a
brief
period
but
was
reinstituted
under
a
new
grand
master
fabré
palaprat
in
besides
publishing
the
list
of
all
grand
masters
known
as
the
charter
of
larmenius
said
to
have
been
preserved
in
the
secret
archives
of
the
temple
these
works
also
reproduce
another
document
drawn
from
the
same
repository
describing
the
origins
of
the
order
this
manuscript
written
in
greek
on
parchment
dated
purports
to
be
partly
taken
from
a
and
relates
that
hugues
de
payens
first
grand
master
of
the
templars
was
initiated
in
that
is
to
say
in
the
year
the
order
was
founded
into
the
religious
doctrine
of
the
primitive
christian
church
by
its
sovereign
pontiff
and
patriarch
theoclet
sixtieth
in
direct
succession
from
john
the
apostle
the
history
of
the
primitive
church
is
then
given
as
follows
moses
was
initiated
in
egypt
profoundly
versed
in
the
physical
theological
and
metaphysical
mysteries
of
the
priests
he
knew
how
to
profit
by
these
so
as
to
surmount
the
power
of
the
mages
and
deliver
his
companions
aaron
his
brother
and
the
chiefs
of
the
hebrews
became
the
depositaries
of
his
doctrine
the
son
of
god
afterwards
appeared
on
the
scene
of
the
world
he
was
brought
up
at
the
school
of
alexandria
imbued
with
a
spirit
wholly
divine
endowed
with
the
most
astounding
qualities
he
was
able
to
reach
all
the
degrees
of
egyptian
initiation
on
his
return
to
jerusalem
he
presented
himself
before
the
chiefs
of
the
synagogue
jesus
christ
directing
the
fruit
of
his
lofty
meditations
towards
universal
civilization
and
the
happiness
of
the
world
rent
the
veil
which
concealed
the
truth
from
the
peoples
he
preached
the
love
of
god
the
love
of
neighbour
and
equality
before
the
common
father
of
all
men
jesus
conferred
evangelical
initiation
on
his
apostles
and
disciples
he
transmitted
his
spirit
to
them
divided
them
into
several
orders
after
the
practice
of
john
the
beloved
disciple
the
apostle
of
fraternal
love
whom
he
had
instituted
sovereign
pontiff
and
patriarch
here
we
have
the
whole
cabalistic
legend
of
a
secret
doctrine
descending
from
moses
of
christ
as
an
egyptian
initiate
and
founder
of
a
secret
order
a
theory
of
course
absolutely
destructive
of
belief
in
his
divinity
the
legend
of
the
du
goes
on
to
say
up
to
about
the
year
the
year
the
order
of
the
temple
was
founded
the
mysteries
and
the
hierarchic
order
of
the
initiation
of
egypt
transmitted
to
the
jews
by
moses
then
to
the
christians
by
were
religiously
preserved
by
the
successors
of
john
the
apostle
these
mysteries
and
initiations
regenerated
by
the
evangelical
initiation
or
baptism
were
a
sacred
trust
which
the
simplicity
of
the
primitive
and
unchanging
morality
of
the
of
the
had
preserved
from
all
adulteration
the
christians
persecuted
by
the
infidels
appreciating
the
courage
and
piety
of
these
brave
crusaders
who
with
the
sword
in
one
hand
and
the
cross
in
the
other
flew
to
the
defence
of
the
holy
places
and
above
all
doing
striking
justice
to
the
virtues
and
the
ardent
charity
of
hugues
de
payens
held
it
their
duty
to
confide
to
hands
so
pure
the
treasures
of
knowledge
acquired
throughout
so
many
centuries
sanctified
by
the
cross
the
dogma
and
the
morality
of
the
hugues
was
invested
with
the
apostolic
patriarchal
power
and
placed
in
the
legitimate
order
of
the
successors
of
john
the
apostle
or
the
evangelist
such
is
the
origin
of
the
foundation
of
the
order
of
the
temple
and
of
the
fusion
in
this
order
of
the
different
kinds
of
initiation
of
the
christians
of
the
east
designated
under
the
title
of
primitive
christians
or
johannites
it
will
be
seen
at
once
that
all
this
story
is
subtly
subversive
of
true
christianity
and
that
the
appellation
of
christians
applied
to
the
johannites
is
an
imposture
indeed
fabré
palaprat
grand
master
of
the
du
in
who
in
his
book
on
the
templars
repeats
the
story
contained
in
the
and
the
manuel
des
chevaliers
du
whilst
making
the
same
profession
of
primitive
christian
doctrines
descending
from
john
through
theoclet
and
hugues
de
payens
to
the
order
over
which
he
presides
goes
on
to
say
that
the
secret
doctrine
of
the
templars
was
essentially
contrary
to
the
canons
of
the
church
of
rome
and
that
it
is
principally
to
this
fact
that
one
must
attribute
the
persecution
of
which
history
has
preserved
the
memory
the
belief
of
the
primitive
christians
and
consequently
that
the
templars
with
regard
to
the
miracles
of
christ
is
that
he
did
or
may
have
done
extraordinary
or
miraculous
things
and
that
since
god
can
do
things
incomprehensible
to
human
intelligence
the
primitive
church
venerates
all
the
acts
of
christ
as
they
are
described
in
the
gospel
whether
it
considers
them
as
acts
of
human
science
or
whether
as
acts
of
divine
power
belief
in
the
divinity
of
christ
is
thus
left
an
open
question
and
the
same
attitude
is
maintained
towards
the
resurrection
of
which
the
story
is
omitted
in
the
gospel
of
john
possessed
by
the
order
fabré
palaprat
further
admits
that
the
gravest
accusations
brought
against
the
templars
were
founded
on
facts
which
he
attempts
to
explain
away
in
the
following
manner
the
templars
having
in
carefully
abstracted
all
the
manuscripts
composing
the
secret
archives
of
the
order
from
the
search
made
by
authority
and
these
authentic
manuscripts
having
been
preciously
preserved
since
that
period
we
have
the
certainty
that
the
knights
endured
a
great
number
of
religious
and
moral
trials
before
reaching
the
different
degrees
of
initiation
thus
for
example
the
recipient
might
receive
the
injunction
under
pain
of
death
to
trample
on
the
crucifix
or
to
worship
an
idol
but
if
he
yielded
to
the
terror
which
they
sought
to
inspire
in
him
he
was
declared
unworthy
of
being
admitted
to
the
higher
grades
of
the
order
one
can
imagine
in
this
way
how
beings
too
feeble
or
too
immoral
to
endure
the
trials
of
initiation
may
have
accused
the
templars
of
giving
themselves
up
to
infamous
practices
and
of
having
superstitious
beliefs
it
is
certainly
not
surprising
that
an
order
which
gave
such
injunctions
as
these
for
whatever
purpose
should
have
become
the
object
of
suspicion
eliphas
lévi
who
like
ragon
accepts
the
statements
of
the
du
concerning
the
johannite
origin
of
the
templars
secret
doctrine
is
however
not
deceived
by
these
professions
of
christianity
and
boldly
asserts
that
the
sovereign
pontiff
theoclet
initiated
hugues
de
payens
into
the
mysteries
and
hopes
of
his
pretended
church
he
lured
him
by
the
ideas
of
sacerdotal
sovereignty
and
supreme
royalty
he
indicated
him
finally
as
his
successor
so
the
order
of
the
knights
of
the
temple
was
stained
from
its
origin
with
schism
and
conspiracy
against
kings
further
lévi
relates
that
the
real
story
told
to
initiates
concerning
christ
was
no
other
than
the
infamous
described
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
book
and
which
the
johannites
dared
to
attribute
to
st
john
this
would
accord
with
the
confession
of
the
catalonian
knight
templar
galcerandus
de
teus
who
stated
that
the
form
of
absolution
in
the
order
was
i
pray
god
that
he
may
pardon
your
sins
as
he
pardoned
mary
magdalene
and
the
thief
on
the
cross
but
the
witness
went
on
to
explain
by
the
thief
of
which
the
head
of
the
chapter
speaks
is
meant
according
to
our
statutes
that
jesus
or
christ
who
was
crucified
by
the
jews
because
he
was
not
god
and
yet
he
said
he
was
god
and
the
king
of
the
jews
which
was
an
outrage
to
the
true
god
who
is
in
heaven
when
jesus
a
few
moments
before
his
death
had
his
side
pierced
by
the
lance
of
longinus
he
repented
of
having
called
himself
god
and
king
of
the
jews
and
he
asked
pardon
of
the
true
god
then
the
true
god
pardoned
him
it
is
thus
that
we
apply
to
the
crucified
christ
these
words
as
god
pardoned
the
thief
on
the
cross
raynouard
who
quotes
this
deposition
stigmatizes
it
as
singular
and
extravagant
matter
agrees
that
it
is
doubtless
extravagant
but
that
it
merits
attention
there
was
a
whole
system
there
which
was
not
the
invention
of
galcerant
eliphas
lévi
provides
the
clue
to
that
system
and
to
the
reason
why
christ
was
described
as
a
thief
by
indicating
the
cabalistic
legend
wherein
he
was
described
as
having
the
sacred
name
from
the
holy
of
holies
elsewhere
he
explains
that
the
johannites
made
themselves
out
to
be
the
only
people
initiated
into
the
true
mysteries
of
the
religion
of
the
saviour
they
professed
to
know
the
real
history
of
jesus
christ
and
by
adopting
part
of
jewish
traditions
and
the
stories
of
the
talmud
they
made
out
that
the
facts
related
in
the
gospels
that
is
to
say
the
gospels
accepted
by
the
orthodox
church
were
only
allegories
of
which
john
gives
the
key
but
it
is
time
to
pass
from
legend
to
facts
for
the
whole
story
of
the
initiation
of
the
templars
by
the
johannites
rests
principally
on
the
documents
produced
by
the
ordre
du
temple
in
according
to
the
abbés
grégoire
and
münter
the
authenticity
and
antiquity
of
these
documents
are
beyond
dispute
grégoire
referring
to
the
parchment
manuscript
of
the
and
gospel
of
john
says
that
hellenists
versed
in
paleography
believe
this
manuscript
to
be
of
the
thirteenth
century
others
declare
it
to
be
earlier
and
to
go
back
to
the
eleventh
century
matter
on
the
other
hand
quoting
opinion
that
the
manuscripts
in
the
archives
of
the
modern
templars
date
from
the
thirteenth
century
observes
that
this
is
all
a
tissue
of
errors
and
that
the
critics
including
the
learned
professor
thilo
of
halle
have
recognized
that
the
manuscript
in
question
far
from
belonging
to
the
thirteenth
century
dates
from
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
from
the
arrangement
of
the
chapters
of
the
gospel
matter
arrives
at
the
conclusion
that
it
was
intended
to
accompany
the
ceremonies
of
some
masonic
or
secret
society
we
shall
return
to
this
possibility
in
a
later
chapter
the
antiquity
of
the
manuscript
containing
the
history
of
the
templars
thus
remains
an
open
question
on
which
no
one
can
pronounce
an
opinion
without
having
seen
the
original
in
order
then
to
judge
of
the
probability
of
the
story
that
this
manuscript
contained
it
is
necessary
to
consult
the
facts
of
history
and
to
discover
what
proof
can
be
found
that
any
such
sect
as
the
johannites
existed
at
the
time
of
the
crusades
or
earlier
certainly
none
is
known
to
have
been
called
by
this
name
or
by
one
resembling
it
before
when
some
portuguese
monks
reported
the
existence
of
a
sect
whom
they
described
as
christians
of
john
inhabiting
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
the
appellation
appears
however
to
have
been
wrongly
applied
by
the
monks
for
the
sectarians
in
question
variously
known
as
the
mandæans
mandaites
sabians
nazoreans
called
themselves
mandaï
iyahi
that
is
to
say
the
disciples
or
rather
the
wise
men
of
john
the
word
being
derived
from
the
chaldean
word
corresponding
to
the
greek
word
γνῶσις
or
wisdom
the
multiplicity
of
names
given
to
the
mandæans
arises
apparently
from
the
fact
that
in
their
dealings
with
other
communities
they
took
the
name
of
sabians
whilst
they
called
the
wise
and
learned
amongst
themselves
nazoreans
the
sect
formerly
inhabited
the
banks
of
the
jordan
but
was
driven
out
by
the
moslems
who
forced
them
to
retire
to
mesopotamia
and
babylonia
where
they
particularly
affected
the
neighbourhood
of
rivers
in
order
to
be
able
to
carry
out
their
peculiar
baptismal
rites
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
doctrines
of
the
mandæans
do
resemble
the
description
of
the
johannite
heresy
as
given
by
eliphas
lévi
though
not
by
the
du
in
that
the
mandæans
professed
to
be
the
disciples
of
john
the
baptist
however
not
the
apostle
but
were
at
the
same
time
the
enemies
of
jesus
christ
according
to
the
of
sidra
yahya
that
is
to
say
john
baptized
myriads
of
men
during
forty
years
in
the
jordan
by
a
mistake
or
in
response
to
a
written
mandate
from
heaven
saying
yahya
baptize
the
liar
in
the
jordan
he
baptized
the
false
prophet
yishu
meshiha
the
messiah
jesus
son
of
the
devil
ruha
kadishta
the
same
idea
is
found
in
another
book
of
the
sect
called
the
book
of
adam
which
represents
jesus
as
the
perverter
of
john
doctrine
and
the
disseminator
of
iniquity
and
perfidy
throughout
the
world
the
resemblance
between
all
this
and
the
legends
of
the
talmud
the
cabala
and
the
toledot
yeshu
is
at
once
apparent
moreover
the
mandæans
claim
for
the
book
of
adam
the
same
origin
as
the
jews
claimed
for
the
cabala
namely
that
it
was
delivered
to
adam
by
god
through
the
hands
of
the
angel
razael
this
book
known
to
scholars
as
the
is
described
by
münter
as
a
sort
of
mosaic
without
order
without
method
where
one
finds
mentioned
noah
abraham
moses
solomon
the
temple
of
jerusalem
john
the
baptist
jesus
christ
the
christians
and
mohammed
matter
whilst
denying
any
proof
of
the
templar
succession
from
the
mandæans
nevertheless
gives
good
reason
for
believing
that
the
sect
itself
existed
from
the
first
centuries
of
the
christian
era
and
that
its
books
dated
from
the
eighth
century
further
that
these
mandæans
or
nazoreans
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
nazarites
or
christian
nazarenes
were
jews
who
revered
john
the
baptist
as
the
prophet
of
ancient
mosaism
but
regarded
jesus
christ
as
a
false
messiah
sent
by
the
powers
of
darkness
modern
jewish
opinion
confirms
this
affirmation
of
judaic
inspiration
and
agrees
with
matter
in
describing
the
mandæans
as
gnostics
their
sacred
books
are
in
an
aramaic
dialect
which
has
close
affinities
with
that
of
the
talmud
of
babylon
the
jewish
influence
is
distinctly
visible
in
the
mandæan
religion
it
is
essentially
of
the
type
of
ancient
gnosticism
traces
of
which
are
found
in
the
talmud
the
midrash
and
in
a
modified
form
the
later
cabala
it
may
then
be
regarded
as
certain
that
a
sect
existed
long
before
the
time
of
the
crusades
corresponding
to
the
description
of
the
johannites
given
by
eliphas
lévi
in
that
it
was
cabalistic
yet
professedly
founded
on
the
doctrines
of
one
of
the
johns
whether
it
was
by
this
sect
that
the
templars
were
indoctrinated
must
remain
an
open
question
matter
objects
that
the
evidence
lacking
to
such
a
conclusion
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
templars
expressed
no
particular
reverence
for
john
but
loiseleur
asserts
that
the
templars
did
prefer
the
gospel
of
john
to
that
of
the
other
evangelists
and
that
modern
masonic
lodges
claiming
descent
from
the
templars
possess
a
special
version
of
this
gospel
said
to
have
been
copied
from
the
original
on
mount
athos
it
is
also
said
that
baphomets
were
preserved
in
the
masonic
lodges
of
hungary
where
a
debased
form
of
masonry
known
as
johannite
masonry
survives
to
this
day
if
the
templar
heresy
was
that
of
the
johannites
the
head
in
question
might
possibly
represent
that
of
john
the
baptist
which
would
accord
with
the
theory
that
the
word
baphomet
was
derived
from
greek
words
signifying
baptism
of
wisdom
this
would
moreover
not
be
incompatible
with
loiseleur
theory
of
an
affinity
between
the
templars
and
the
bogomils
for
the
bogomils
also
possessed
their
own
version
of
the
gospel
of
john
which
they
placed
on
the
heads
of
their
neophytes
during
the
ceremony
of
initiation
giving
as
the
reason
for
the
peculiar
veneration
they
professed
for
its
author
that
they
regarded
john
as
the
servant
of
the
jewish
god
satanael
eliphas
lévi
even
goes
so
far
as
to
accuse
the
templars
of
following
the
occult
practices
of
the
luciferians
who
carried
the
doctrines
of
the
bogomils
to
the
point
of
paying
homage
to
the
powers
of
darkness
let
us
declare
for
the
edification
of
the
vulgar
and
for
the
greater
glory
of
the
church
which
has
persecuted
the
templars
burned
the
magicians
and
excommunicated
the
let
us
say
boldly
and
loudly
that
all
the
initiates
of
the
occult
sciences
have
adored
do
and
will
always
adore
that
which
is
signified
by
this
frightful
symbol
the
sabbatic
goat
yes
in
our
profound
conviction
the
grand
masters
of
the
order
of
the
templars
adored
baphomet
and
caused
him
to
be
adored
by
their
initiates
it
will
be
seen
then
that
the
accusation
of
heresy
brought
against
the
templars
does
not
emanate
solely
from
the
catholic
church
but
also
from
the
secret
societies
even
our
freemasons
who
for
reasons
i
shall
show
later
have
generally
defended
the
order
are
now
willing
to
admit
that
there
was
a
very
real
case
against
them
thus
dr
ranking
who
has
devoted
many
years
of
study
to
the
question
has
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
johannism
is
the
real
clue
to
the
templar
heresy
in
a
very
interesting
paper
published
in
the
masonic
journal
quatuor
he
observes
that
the
record
of
the
templars
in
palestine
is
one
long
tale
of
intrigue
and
treachery
on
the
part
of
the
order
and
finally
that
from
the
very
commencement
of
christianity
there
has
been
transmitted
through
the
centuries
a
body
of
doctrine
incompatible
with
christianity
in
the
various
official
churches
that
the
bodies
teaching
these
doctrines
professed
to
do
so
on
the
authority
of
john
to
whom
as
they
claimed
the
true
secrets
had
been
committed
by
the
founder
of
christianity
that
during
the
middle
ages
the
main
support
of
the
gnostic
bodies
and
the
main
repository
of
this
knowledge
was
the
society
of
the
templars
what
is
the
explanation
of
this
choice
of
john
for
the
propagation
of
doctrines
which
we
shall
find
continuing
up
to
the
present
day
what
else
than
the
method
of
perversion
which
in
its
extreme
form
becomes
satanism
and
consists
in
always
selecting
the
most
sacred
things
for
the
purpose
of
desecration
precisely
then
because
the
gospel
of
john
is
the
one
of
all
the
four
which
most
insists
on
the
divinity
of
christ
the
occult
sects
have
habitually
made
it
the
basis
of
their
rites
three
centuries
of
occultism
it
has
been
shown
in
the
foregoing
chapters
that
from
very
early
times
occult
sects
had
existed
for
two
purposes
esoteric
and
political
whilst
the
manicheans
the
early
ismailis
the
bogomils
and
the
luciferians
had
concerned
themselves
mainly
with
religious
or
esoteric
doctrines
the
later
ismailis
the
fatimites
the
karmathites
and
templars
had
combined
secrecy
and
occult
rites
with
the
political
aim
of
domination
we
shall
find
this
double
tradition
running
through
all
the
secret
society
movement
up
to
the
present
day
the
dualist
doctrines
attributed
to
the
templars
were
not
however
confined
to
this
order
in
europe
but
had
been
as
we
have
seen
those
professed
by
the
bogomils
and
also
by
the
cathari
who
spread
westwards
from
bulgaria
and
bosnia
to
france
it
was
owing
to
their
sojourn
in
bulgaria
that
the
cathari
gained
the
popular
nickname
of
bulgars
or
bourgres
signifying
those
addicted
to
unnatural
vice

of
the
cathari
in
the
south
of
france
became
known
after
as
the
albigenses
thus
called
from
the
town
of
albi
although
their
headquarters
were
really
in
toulouse
christians
only
in
name
they
adhered
in
secret
to
the
gnostic
and
manichean
doctrines
of
the
earlier
cathari
which
they
would
appear
to
have
combined
with
johannism
since
like
this
eastern
sect
they
claimed
to
possess
their
own
gospel
of
st
john
although
not
strictly
a
secret
society
the
albigenses
were
divided
after
the
secret
society
system
into
initiates
and
the
former
few
in
number
known
as
the
led
in
appearance
an
austere
life
refraining
from
meat
and
professing
abhorrence
of
oaths
or
of
lying
the
mystery
in
which
they
enveloped
themselves
won
for
them
the
adoring
reverence
of
the
who
formed
the
great
majority
of
the
sect
and
gave
themselves
up
to
every
vice
to
usury
brigandage
and
perjury
and
whilst
describing
marriage
as
prostitution
condoning
incest
and
all
forms
of
licence
the
who
were
probably
not
fully
initiated
into
the
dualist
doctrines
of
their
superiors
looked
to
them
for
salvation
through
the
of
hands
according
to
the
system
of
the
manicheans
it
was
amongst
the
nobles
of
languedoc
that
the
albigenses
found
their
principal
support
this
judæa
of
france
as
it
has
been
called
was
peopled
by
a
medley
of
mixed
races
iberian
gallic
roman
and
semitic
the
nobles
very
different
from
the
ignorant
and
pious
chivalry
of
the
north
had
lost
all
respect
for
their
traditions
there
were
few
who
in
going
back
did
not
encounter
some
saracen
or
jewish
grandmother
in
their
genealogy
moreover
many
had
brought
back
to
europe
the
laxity
of
morals
they
had
contracted
during
the
crusades
the
comte
de
comminges
practised
polygamy
and
according
to
ecclesiastical
chronicles
raymond
vi
comte
de
toulouse
one
of
the
most
ardent
of
the
albigense
had
his
harem
the
albigensian
movement
has
been
falsely
represented
as
a
protest
merely
against
the
tyranny
of
the
church
of
rome
in
reality
it
was
a
rising
against
the
fundamental
doctrines
of
christianity
more
than
this
against
all
principles
of
religion
and
morality
for
whilst
some
of
the
sect
openly
declared
that
the
jewish
law
was
preferable
to
that
of
the
christians
to
others
the
god
of
the
old
testament
was
as
abhorrent
as
the
false
christ
who
suffered
at
golgotha
the
old
hatred
of
the
gnostics
and
manicheans
for
the
demiurgus
lived
again
in
these
rebels
against
the
social
order
forerunners
of
the
libertines
and
illuminati
the
albigense
nobles
under
the
pretext
of
fighting
the
priesthood
strove
to
throw
off
all
the
restraints
the
church
imposed
inevitably
the
disorders
that
took
place
throughout
the
south
of
france
led
to
reprisals
and
the
albigenses
were
suppressed
with
all
the
cruelty
of
the
age
a
fact
which
has
afforded
historians
the
opportunity
to
exalt
them
as
noble
martyrs
victims
of
ecclesiastical
despotism
but
again
as
in
the
case
of
the
templars
the
fact
that
they
were
persecuted
does
not
prove
them
innocent
of
the
crimes
laid
to
their
charge
satanism
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
another
development
of
dualism
far
more
horrible
than
the
manichean
heresy
of
the
albigenses
began
to
make
itself
felt
this
was
the
cult
of
satanism
or
black
magic
the
subject
is
one
that
must
be
approached
with
extreme
caution
owing
to
the
fact
that
on
one
hand
much
that
has
been
written
about
it
is
the
result
of
mediæval
superstition
which
sees
in
every
departure
from
the
roman
catholic
faith
the
direct
intervention
of
the
evil
one
whilst
on
the
other
hand
the
conspiracy
of
history
which
denies
the
existence
of
the
occult
power
discredits
all
revelations
on
this
question
from
whatever
source
they
emanate
as
the
outcome
of
hysterical
imagination
this
is
rendered
all
the
easier
since
the
subject
by
its
amazing
extravagance
lends
itself
to
ridicule
it
is
however
idle
to
deny
that
the
cult
of
evil
has
always
existed
the
invocation
of
the
powers
of
darkness
was
practised
in
the
earliest
days
of
the
human
race
and
after
the
christian
era
found
its
expression
as
we
have
seen
in
the
cainites
the
euchites
and
the
luciferians
these
are
not
surmises
but
actual
facts
of
history
towards
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
luciferianism
spread
eastwards
through
styria
the
tyrol
and
bohemia
even
as
far
as
brandenburg
by
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
it
had
invaded
western
germany
and
in
the
fourteenth
century
reached
its
zenith
in
that
country
as
also
in
italy
and
france
the
cult
had
now
reached
a
further
stage
in
its
development
and
it
was
not
the
mere
propitiation
of
satanael
as
the
prince
of
this
world
practised
by
the
luciferians
but
actual
satanism
the
love
of
evil
for
the
sake
of
evil
which
formed
the
doctrine
of
the
sect
known
in
italy
as
vecchia
or
the
old
religion
sorcery
was
adopted
as
a
profession
and
witches
not
as
is
popularly
supposed
sporadic
growths
were
trained
in
schools
of
magic
to
practise
their
art
these
facts
should
be
remembered
when
the
church
is
blamed
for
the
violence
it
displayed
against
witchcraft
it
was
not
individuals
but
a
system
which
it
set
out
to
destroy
the
essence
of
satanism
is
desecration
in
the
ceremonies
for
infernal
evocation
described
by
eliphas
lévi
we
read
it
is
requisite
to
profane
the
ceremonies
of
the
religion
one
belongs
to
and
to
trample
its
holiest
symbols
under
foot
this
practice
found
a
climax
in
desecrating
the
holy
sacrament
the
consecrated
wafer
was
given
as
food
to
mice
toads
and
pigs
or
denied
in
unspeakable
ways
a
revolting
description
of
the
black
mass
may
be
found
in
huysmans
book
it
is
unnecessary
to
transcribe
the
loathsome
details
here
suffice
it
then
to
show
that
this
cult
had
a
very
real
existence
and
if
any
further
doubt
remains
on
the
matter
the
life
of
gilles
de
rais
supplies
documentary
evidence
of
the
visible
results
of
black
magic
in
the
middle
ages
gilles
de
rais
was
born
at
machecoul
in
brittany
about
the
year
the
first
period
of
his
life
was
glorious
the
companion
and
guide
of
jeanne
he
became
maréchal
of
france
and
distinguished
himself
by
many
deeds
of
valour
but
after
dissipating
his
immense
fortune
largely
on
church
ceremonies
carried
out
with
the
wildest
extravagance
he
was
led
to
study
alchemy
partly
by
curiosity
and
partly
as
a
means
for
restoring
his
shattered
fortunes
hearing
that
germany
and
italy
were
the
countries
where
alchemy
flourished
he
enlisted
italians
in
his
service
and
was
gradually
drawn
into
the
further
region
of
magic
according
to
huysmans
gilles
de
rais
had
remained
until
this
moment
a
christian
mystic
under
the
influence
of
jeanne
but
after
her
death
possibly
in
despair
he
offered
himself
to
the
powers
of
darkness
evokers
of
satan
now
flocked
to
him
from
every
side
amongst
them
prelati
an
italian
by
no
means
the
old
and
wrinkled
sorcerer
of
tradition
but
a
young
and
attractive
man
of
charming
manners
for
it
was
from
italy
that
came
the
most
skilful
adepts
in
the
art
of
alchemy
astrology
magic
and
infernal
evocation
who
spread
themselves
over
europe
particularly
france
under
the
influence
of
these
initiators
gilles
de
rais
signed
a
letter
to
the
devil
in
a
meadow
near
machecoul
asking
him
for
knowledge
power
and
riches
and
offering
in
exchange
anything
that
might
be
asked
of
him
with
the
exception
of
his
life
or
his
soul
but
in
spite
of
this
appeal
and
of
a
pact
signed
with
the
blood
of
the
writer
no
satanic
apparitions
were
forthcoming
it
was
then
that
becoming
still
more
desperate
gilles
de
rais
had
recourse
to
the
abominations
for
which
his
name
has
remained
infamous
still
more
frightful
invocations
loathsome
debaucheries
perverted
vice
in
every
form
sadic
cruelties
horrible
sacrifices
and
finally
holocausts
of
little
boys
and
girls
collected
by
his
agents
in
the
surrounding
country
and
put
to
death
with
the
most
inhuman
tortures
during
the
years
literally
hundreds
of
children
disappeared
many
of
the
names
of
the
unhappy
little
victims
were
preserved
in
the
records
of
the
period
gilles
de
rais
met
with
a
end
in
he
was
hanged
and
burnt
so
far
he
does
not
appear
to
have
found
a
panegyrist
to
place
him
in
the
ranks
of
noble
martyrs
it
will
of
course
be
urged
that
the
crimes
here
described
were
those
of
a
criminal
lunatic
and
not
to
be
attributed
to
any
occult
cause
the
answer
to
this
is
that
gilles
was
not
an
isolated
unit
but
one
of
a
group
of
occultists
who
can
not
all
have
been
mad
moreover
it
was
only
after
his
invocation
of
the
evil
one
that
he
developed
these
monstrous
proclivities
so
also
his
replica
the
marquis
de
sade
combined
with
his
abominations
an
impassioned
hatred
of
the
christian
religion
what
is
the
explanation
of
this
craze
for
magic
in
western
europe
deschamps
points
to
the
cabala
that
science
of
demoniacal
arts
of
which
the
jews
were
the
initiators
and
undoubtedly
in
any
comprehensive
review
of
the
question
the
influence
of
the
jewish
cabalists
can
not
be
ignored
in
spain
portugal
provence
and
italy
the
jews
by
the
fifteenth
century
had
become
a
power
as
early
as
they
had
penetrated
into
the
intellectual
circles
of
florence
and
it
was
also
in
italy
that
a
century
later
the
modern
cabalistic
school
was
inaugurated
by
isaac
luria
whose
doctrines
were
organized
into
a
practical
system
by
the
hasidim
of
eastern
europe
for
the
writing
of
amulets
the
conjuration
of
devils
mystical
jugglery
with
numbers
and
letters
etc
italy
in
the
fifteenth
century
was
thus
a
centre
from
which
cabalistic
influences
radiated
and
it
may
be
that
the
italians
who
indoctrinated
gilles
de
rais
had
drawn
their
inspiration
from
this
source
indeed
eliphas
lévi
who
certainly
can
not
be
accused
of
declares
that
the
jews
the
most
faithful
trustees
of
the
secret
of
the
cabala
were
almost
always
the
reat
masters
of
magic
in
the
middle
ages
and
suggests
that
gilles
de
rais
took
his
monstrous
recipes
for
using
the
blood
of
murdered
children
from
some
of
those
old
hebrew
books
on
magic
which
if
they
had
been
known
would
have
sufficed
to
hold
up
the
jews
to
the
execration
of
the
whole
earth
voltaire
in
his
likewise
attributes
the
magical
practised
in
the
sixteenth
century
to
jewish
inspiration

voltaire
adds
in
a
footnote
it
was
ordinarily
jews
that
were
made
use
of
for
magical
operations
this
ancient
superstition
comes
from
the
secrets
of
the
cabala
of
which
the
jews
called
themselves
the
sole
depositaries
catherine
de
medicis
the
maréchal
and
many
others
employed
jews
for
these
spells
this
charge
of
black
magic
recurs
all
through
the
history
of
europe
from
the
earliest
times
the
jews
are
accused
of
poisoning
wells
of
practising
ritual
murder
of
using
stolen
church
property
for
purposes
of
desecration
etc
no
doubt
there
enters
into
all
this
a
great
amount
of
exaggeration
inspired
by
popular
prejudice
and
mediæval
superstition
yet
whilst
condeming
the
persecution
to
which
the
jews
were
subjected
on
this
account
it
must
be
admitted
that
they
laid
themselves
open
to
suspicion
by
their
real
addiction
to
magical
arts
if
ignorant
superstition
is
found
on
the
side
of
the
persecutors
still
more
amazing
superstition
is
found
on
the
side
of
the
persecuted
demonology
in
europe
was
in
fact
essentially
a
jewish
science
for
although
a
belief
in
evil
spirits
existed
from
the
earliest
times
and
has
always
continued
to
exist
amongst
primitive
races
and
also
amongst
the
ignorant
classes
in
civilized
countries
it
was
mainly
through
the
jews
that
these
dark
superstitions
were
imported
to
the
west
where
they
persisted
not
merely
amongst
the
lower
strata
of
the
jewish
population
but
formed
an
essential
part
of
jewish
tradition
thus
the
talmud
says
if
the
eye
could
perceive
the
demons
that
people
the
universe
existence
would
be
impossible
the
demons
are
more
numerous
than
we
are
they
surround
us
on
all
sides
like
trenches
dug
round
vineyards
every
one
of
us
has
a
thousand
on
his
left
hand
and
ten
thousand
on
his
right
the
discomfort
endured
by
those
who
attend
rabbinical
conferences
comes
from
the
demons
mingling
with
men
in
these
circumstances
besides
the
fatigue
one
feels
in
knees
in
walking
comes
from
the
demons
that
one
knocks
up
against
at
every
step
if
the
clothing
of
the
rabbis
wears
out
so
quickly
it
is
again
because
the
demons
rub
up
against
them
whoever
wants
to
convince
himself
of
their
presence
has
only
to
surround
his
bed
with
sifted
cinders
and
the
next
morning
he
will
see
the
imprints
of
cocks
feet
the
same
treatise
goes
on
to
give
directions
for
seeing
demons
by
burning
portions
of
a
black
cat
and
placing
the
ashes
in
one
eye
then
at
once
one
perceives
the
demons
the
talmud
also
explains
that
devils
particularly
inhabit
the
waterspouts
on
houses
and
are
fond
of
drinking
out
of
therefore
it
is
advisable
to
pour
a
little
water
out
of
a
jug
before
drinking
so
as
to
get
rid
of
the
unclean
part
these
ideas
received
a
fresh
impetus
from
the
publication
of
the
zohar
which
a
jewish
writer
tells
us
from
the
fourteenth
century
held
almost
unbroken
sway
over
the
minds
of
the
majority
of
the
jews
in
it
the
talmudic
legends
concerning
the
existence
and
activity
of
the
demons
are
repeated
and
amplified
and
a
hierarchy
of
demons
was
established
corresponding
to
the
heavenly
hierarchy
manasseh
ben
israel
is
full
of
information
concerning
belief
in
demons
even
the
scholarly
and
learned
rabbis
of
the
seventeenth
century
clung
to
the
belief
here
then
it
is
not
a
case
of
ignorant
peasants
evolving
fantastic
visions
from
their
own
scared
imaginations
but
of
the
rabbis
the
acknowledged
leaders
of
a
race
claiming
civilized
traditions
and
a
high
order
of
intelligence
deliberately
inculcating
in
their
disciples
the
perpetual
fear
of
demoniacal
influences
how
much
of
this
fear
communicated
itself
to
the
gentile
population
it
is
at
any
rate
a
curious
coincidence
to
notice
the
resemblances
between
popular
superstitions
and
the
writings
of
the
rabbis
for
example
the
vile
confessions
made
both
by
scotch
and
french
peasant
women
accused
of
witchcraft
concerning
the
nocturnal
visits
paid
them
by
male
devils
find
an
exact
counterpart
in
passages
of
the
cabala
where
it
is
said
that
the
demons
are
both
male
and
female
and
they
also
endeavour
to
consort
with
human
beings
a
conception
from
which
arises
the
belief
in
and
thus
on
jewish
authority
we
learn
the
judaic
origin
of
this
strange
delusion
it
is
clearly
to
the
same
source
that
we
may
trace
the
magical
formulæ
for
the
healing
of
diseases
current
at
the
same
period
from
the
earliest
times
the
jews
had
specialized
in
medicine
and
many
royal
personages
insisted
on
employing
jewish
doctors
some
of
whom
may
have
acquired
medical
knowledge
of
a
high
order
the
jewish
writer
margoliouth
dwells
on
this
fact
with
some
complacency
and
goes
on
to
contrast
the
scientific
methods
of
the
hebrew
doctors
with
the
quackeries
of
the
monks
in
spite
of
the
reports
circulated
by
the
monks
that
the
jews
were
sorcerers
in
consequence
of
their
superior
medical
skill
christian
patients
would
frequent
the
houses
of
the
jewish
physicians
in
preference
to
the
monasteries
where
cures
were
pretended
to
have
been
effected
by
some
extraordinary
relics
such
as
the
nails
of
augustine
the
extremity
of
peter
second
toe
etc
it
need
hardly
be
added
that
the
cures
effected
by
the
jewish
physicians
were
more
numerous
than
those
by
the
monkish
impostors
yet
in
reality
the
grotesque
remedies
which
margoliouth
attributes
to
christian
superstition
appear
to
have
been
partly
derived
from
jewish
sources
the
author
of
a
further
article
on
magic
in
goes
on
to
say
that
the
magical
formulæ
handed
down
in
latin
in
ancient
medical
writings
and
used
by
the
monks
were
mainly
of
eastern
origin
derived
from
babylonish
egyptian
and
jewish
magic
the
monks
therefore
played
merely
an
intermediate
rôle
indeed
if
we
turn
to
the
talmud
we
shall
find
cures
recommended
no
less
absurd
than
those
which
margoliouth
derides
for
example
the
eggs
of
a
grasshopper
as
a
remedy
for
toothache
the
tooth
of
a
fox
as
a
remedy
for
sleep
viz
the
tooth
of
a
live
fox
to
prevent
sleep
and
of
a
dead
one
to
cause
sleep
the
nail
from
the
gallows
where
a
man
was
hanged
as
a
remedy
for
swelling
a
strongly
writer
quotes
a
number
of
jewish
medical
writings
of
the
eighteenth
century
republished
as
late
as
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
which
show
the
persistence
of
these
magical
formulæ
amongst
the
jews
most
of
these
are
too
loathsome
to
transcribe
but
some
of
the
more
innocuous
are
as
follows
for
epilepsy
kill
a
cock
and
let
it
putrefy
in
order
to
protect
yourself
from
all
evils
gird
yourself
with
the
rope
with
which
a
criminal
has
been
hung
blood
of
different
kinds
also
plays
an
important
part
fox
blood
and
blood
are
good
for
stone
in
the
bladder
ram
blood
for
colic
weasel
blood
for
scrofula
these
to
be
externally
applied
but
to
return
to
satanism
whoever
were
the
secret
inspirers
of
magical
and
diabolical
practices
during
the
fourteenth
to
the
eighteenth
centuries
the
evidence
of
the
existence
of
satanism
during
this
long
period
is
overwhelming
and
rests
on
the
actual
facts
of
history
details
quite
as
extravagant
and
revolting
as
those
contained
in
the
works
of
eliphas
lévi
or
in
huysmans
are
given
in
documentary
form
by
margaret
alice
murray
in
her
singularly
passionless
work
relating
principally
to
the
witches
of
scotland
the
cult
of
evil
is
a
reality
by
whatever
means
we
may
seek
to
explain
it
eliphas
lévi
whilst
denying
the
existence
of
satan
as
a
superior
personality
and
power
admits
this
fundamental
truth
evil
exists
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
it
we
can
do
good
or
evil
there
are
beings
who
knowingly
and
voluntarily
do
evil
there
are
also
beings
who
love
evil
lévi
has
admirably
described
the
spirit
that
animates
such
beings
in
his
definition
of
black
magic
black
magic
is
really
but
a
combination
of
sacrileges
and
murders
graduated
with
a
view
to
the
permanent
perversion
of
the
human
will
and
the
realization
in
a
living
man
of
the
monstrous
phantom
of
the
fiend
it
is
therefore
properly
speaking
the
religion
of
the
devil
the
worship
of
darkness
the
hatred
of
goodness
exaggerated
to
the
point
of
paroxysm
it
is
the
incarnation
of
death
and
the
permanent
creation
of
hell
the
middle
ages
which
depicted
the
devil
fleeing
from
holy
water
were
not
perhaps
quite
so
benighted
as
our
superior
modern
culture
has
led
us
to
suppose
for
that
hatred
of
goodness
exaggerated
to
the
point
of
paroxysm
that
impulse
to
desecrate
and
defile
which
forms
the
basis
of
black
magic
and
has
manifested
itself
in
successive
phases
of
the
springs
from
fear
so
by
their
very
hatred
the
powers
of
darkness
proclaim
the
existence
of
the
powers
of
light
and
their
own
impotence
in
the
cry
of
the
demoniac
what
have
we
to
do
with
thee
jesus
of
nazareth
art
thou
come
to
destroy
us
i
know
thee
who
thou
art
the
holy
one
of
god
do
we
not
hear
the
unwilling
tribute
of
the
vanquished
to
the
victor
in
the
mighty
conflict
between
good
and
evil
the
rosicrucians
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
magic
it
is
necessary
to
realize
that
although
to
the
world
in
general
the
word
is
synonymous
with
necromancy
it
does
not
bear
this
significance
in
the
language
of
occultism
particularly
the
occultism
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
magic
at
this
date
was
a
term
employed
to
cover
many
branches
of
investigation
which
robert
fludd
the
english
rosicrucian
classified
under
various
headings
of
which
the
first
three
are
as
follows
that
most
occult
and
secret
department
of
physics
by
which
the
mystical
properties
of
natural
substances
are
extracted
which
enables
adepts
in
the
art
to
construct
marvellous
machines
by
means
of
their
geometrical
knowledge
whilst
is
familiar
with
potions
philtres
and
with
various
preparations
of
poisons
it
is
obvious
that
all
these
have
now
passed
into
the
realms
of
science
and
are
no
longer
regarded
as
magical
arts
but
the
further
categories
enumerated
by
fludd
and
comprised
under
the
general
heading
of
retain
the
popular
sense
of
the
term
these
are
described
as
i
which
consists
in
diabolical
commerce
with
unclean
spirits
in
rites
of
criminal
curiosity
in
illicit
songs
and
invocations
and
in
the
evocation
of
the
souls
of
the
dead
which
is
the
adjuration
of
the
devils
by
the
virtue
of
divine
names
and
purporting
to
be
governed
by
good
angels
and
the
divine
will
but
its
wonders
are
most
frequently
performed
by
evil
spirits
who
assume
the
names
of
god
and
of
the
angels
the
last
species
of
magic
is
the
begetting
illusory
phenomena
by
this
art
the
magi
produced
their
phantoms
and
other
marvels
to
this
list
might
be
added
or
knowledge
dealing
with
the
influence
of
the
heavenly
bodies
on
which
astrology
is
based
the
forms
of
magic
dealt
with
in
the
preceding
part
of
this
chapter
belong
therefore
to
the
second
half
of
these
categories
that
is
to
say
to
necromantic
magic
but
at
the
same
period
another
movement
was
gradually
taking
shape
which
concerned
itself
with
the
first
category
enumerated
above
that
is
to
say
the
secret
properties
of
natural
substances
a
man
whose
methods
appear
to
have
approached
to
the
modern
conception
of
scientific
research
was
theophrastus
bombastus
von
hohenheim
commonly
known
as
paracelsus
the
son
of
a
german
doctor
born
about
who
during
his
travels
in
the
east
is
said
to
have
acquired
a
knowledge
of
some
secret
doctrine
which
he
afterwards
elaborated
into
a
system
for
the
healing
of
diseases
although
his
ideas
were
thus
doubtless
drawn
from
some
of
the
same
sources
as
those
from
which
the
jewish
cabala
descended
paracelsus
does
not
appear
to
have
been
a
cabalist
but
a
scientist
of
no
mean
order
and
as
an
isolated
thinker
apparently
connected
with
no
secret
association
does
not
enter
further
into
the
scope
of
this
work
paracelsus
must
therefore
not
be
identified
with
the
school
of
christian
cabalists
who
from
raymond
lulli
the
doctor
illuminatus
of
the
thirteenth
century
onward
drew
their
inspiration
from
the
cabala
of
the
jews
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
influence
under
which
they
fell
was
wholly
pernicious
for
just
as
certain
jews
appear
to
have
acquired
some
real
medical
skill
so
also
they
appear
to
have
possessed
some
real
knowledge
of
natural
science
inherited
perhaps
from
the
ancient
traditions
of
the
east
or
derived
from
the
writings
of
hippocrates
galen
and
other
of
the
great
greek
physicians
and
as
yet
unknown
to
europe
thus
eliphas
lévi
relates
that
the
rabbi
jechiel
a
cabalistic
jew
protected
by
louis
possessed
the
secret
of
lamps
claimed
later
by
the
rosicrucians
which
suggests
the
possibility
that
some
kind
of
luminous
gas
or
electric
light
may
have
been
known
to
the
jews
in
alchemy
they
were
the
acknowledged
leaders
the
most
noted
alchemist
of
the
fourteenth
century
nicholas
flamel
discovered
the
secret
of
the
art
from
the
book
of
abraham
the
jew
prince
priest
levite
astrologer
and
philosopher
and
this
actual
book
is
said
to
have
passed
later
into
the
possession
of
cardinal
richelieu
it
was
likewise
from
a
florentine
jew
alemanus
or
datylus
that
pico
della
mirandola
the
mystic
received
instructions
in
the
cabala
and
imagined
that
he
had
discovered
in
it
the
doctrines
of
christianity
this
delighted
pope
sixtus
iv
who
thereupon
ordered
cabalistic
writings
to
be
translated
into
latin
for
the
use
of
divinity
students
at
the
same
time
the
cabala
was
introduced
into
germany
by
reuchlin
who
had
learnt
hebrew
from
the
rabbi
jacob
jechiel
loans
court
physician
to
frederick
iii
and
in
published
a
cabalistic
treatise
verbo
showing
that
all
wisdom
and
true
philosophy
are
derived
from
the
hebrews
considerable
alarm
appears
however
to
have
been
created
by
the
spread
of
rabbinical
literature
and
in
a
jew
converted
to
christianity
named
pfefferkorn
persuaded
the
emperor
maximilian
i
to
burn
all
jewish
books
except
the
old
testament
reuchlin
consulted
on
this
matter
advised
only
the
destruction
of
the
toledot
yeshu
and
of
the
sepher
nizzachon
by
the
rabbi
lipmann
because
these
works
were
full
of
blasphemies
against
christ
and
against
the
christian
religion
but
urged
the
preservation
of
the
rest
in
this
defence
of
jewish
literature
he
was
supported
by
the
duke
of
bavaria
who
appointed
him
professor
at
ingoldstadt
but
was
strongly
condemned
by
the
dominicans
of
cologne
in
reply
to
their
attacks
reuchlin
launched
his
defence
arte
glorifying
the
cabala
of
which
the
central
doctrine
for
him
was
the
messianology
around
which
all
its
other
doctrines
grouped
themselves
his
whole
philosophical
system
as
he
himself
admitted
was
in
fact
entirely
cabalistic
and
his
views
were
shared
by
his
contemporary
cornelius
agrippa
of
nettesheim
as
a
result
of
these
teachings
a
craze
for
cabalism
spread
amongst
christian
prelates
statesmen
and
warriors
and
a
number
of
christian
thinkers
took
up
the
doctrines
of
the
cabala
and
essayed
to
work
them
over
in
their
own
way
athanasius
kircher
and
knorr
baron
von
rosenroth
author
of
the
in
the
course
of
the
seventeenth
century
endeavoured
to
spread
the
cabala
among
the
christians
by
translating
cabalistic
works
which
they
regarded
as
most
ancient
wisdom
most
of
them
the
goes
on
to
observe
derisively
held
the
absurd
idea
that
the
cabala
contained
proofs
of
the
truth
of
christianity
much
that
appears
christian
in
the
cabala
is
in
fact
nothing
but
the
logical
development
of
certain
ancient
esoteric
doctrines
the
rosicrucians
appear
to
have
been
the
outcome
both
of
this
cabalistic
movement
and
of
the
teachings
of
paracelsus
the
earliest
intimation
of
their
existence
was
given
in
a
series
of
pamphlets
which
appeared
at
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
first
of
these
entitled
the
fraternitatis
or
a
discovery
of
the
fraternity
of
the
most
laudable
order
of
the
rosy
was
published
at
cassel
in
and
the
early
in
the
following
year
these
contain
what
may
be
described
as
the
grand
legend
of
rosicrucianism
which
has
been
repeated
with
slight
variations
up
to
the
present
day
briefly
this
story
is
as
follows
the
most
godly
and
father
our
brother
that
is
to
say
christian
rosenkreutz
a
german
the
chief
and
original
of
our
fraternity
was
born
in
and
some
sixteen
years
later
travelled
to
the
east
with
a
brother
who
had
determined
to
go
to
the
holy
land
on
reaching
cyprus
brother
died
and
so
never
came
to
jerusalem
brother
however
having
become
acquainted
with
certain
wise
men
of
damasco
in
arabia
and
beheld
what
great
wonders
they
wrought
went
on
alone
to
damasco
here
the
wise
men
received
him
and
he
then
set
himself
to
study
physick
and
mathematics
and
to
translate
the
book
m
into
latin
after
three
years
he
went
to
egypt
whence
he
journeyed
on
to
fez
where
he
did
get
acquaintance
with
those
who
are
called
the
elementary
inhabitants
who
revealed
to
him
many
of
their
secrets
of
those
of
fez
he
often
did
confess
that
their
magia
was
not
altogether
pure
and
also
that
their
cabala
was
defiled
with
their
religion
but
notwithstanding
he
knew
how
to
make
good
use
of
the
same
after
two
years
brother
departed
the
city
fez
and
sailed
away
with
many
costly
things
into
spain
where
he
conferred
with
the
learned
men
and
being
ready
bountifully
to
impart
all
his
arts
and
secrets
showed
them
amongst
other
things
how
there
might
be
a
society
in
europe
which
might
have
gold
silver
and
precious
stones
sufficient
for
them
to
bestow
on
kings
for
their
necessary
uses
and
lawful
purposes
christian
rosenkreutz
then
returned
to
germany
where
there
is
nowadays
no
want
of
learned
men
magicians
cabalists
physicians
and
philosophers
here
he
builded
himself
a
fitting
and
neat
habitation
in
which
he
ruminated
his
voyage
and
philosophy
and
reduced
them
together
in
a
true
memorial
at
the
end
of
five
years
meditation
there
came
again
into
his
mind
the
reformation
accordingly
he
chose
some
few
adjoyned
with
him
the
brethren
and
the
last
of
whom
was
very
expert
and
well
learned
in
cabala
as
his
book
h
witnesseth
to
form
a
circle
of
initiates
after
this
manner
began
the
fraternity
of
the
rosy
cross
five
other
brethren
were
afterwards
added
all
germans
except
and
these
eight
constituted
his
new
building
called
sancti
spiritus
the
following
agreement
was
then
drawn
up
first
that
none
of
them
should
profess
any
other
thing
than
to
cure
the
sick
and
that
gratis
second
none
of
the
posterity
should
be
constrained
to
wear
one
certain
kind
of
habit
but
therein
to
follow
the
custom
of
the
country
third
that
every
year
upon
the
day
they
should
meet
together
at
the
house
sancti
spiritus
or
write
the
cause
of
his
absence
fourth
every
brother
should
look
about
for
a
worthy
person
who
after
his
decease
might
succeed
him
fifth
the
word
should
be
their
seal
mark
and
character
sixth
the
fraternity
should
remain
secret
one
hundred
years
finally
brother
died
but
where
and
when
or
in
what
country
he
was
buried
remained
a
secret
the
date
however
is
generally
given
as
in
the
brethren
who
then
constituted
the
inner
circle
of
the
order
discovered
a
door
on
which
was
written
in
large
letters
post
annos
patebo
on
opening
the
door
a
vault
was
disclosed
to
view
where
beneath
a
brass
tablet
the
body
of
christian
rosenkreutz
was
found
whole
and
unconsumed
with
all
his
ornaments
and
attires
and
holding
in
his
hand
the
parchment
i
which
next
unto
the
bible
is
our
greatest
treasure
whilst
beside
him
lay
a
number
of
books
amongst
others
the
of
paracelsus
who
however
the
observes
earlier
was
none
of
our
fraternity
the
brethren
now
knew
that
after
a
time
there
would
be
a
general
reformation
both
of
divine
and
human
things
while
declaring
their
belief
in
the
christian
faith
the
goes
on
to
explain
that
our
philosophy
is
not
a
new
invention
but
as
adam
after
his
fall
hath
received
it
and
as
moses
and
solomon
used
it
wherein
plato
aristotle
pythagoras
and
others
did
hit
the
mark
and
wherein
enoch
abraham
moses
solomon
did
excel
but
especially
wherewith
that
wonderful
book
the
bible
agreeth
it
will
be
seen
that
according
to
this
manifesto
rosicrucianism
was
a
combination
of
the
ancient
secret
tradition
handed
down
from
the
patriarchs
through
the
philosophers
of
greece
and
of
the
first
cabala
of
the
jews
the
grand
legend
of
rosicrucianism
rests
however
on
no
historical
evidence
there
is
in
fact
not
the
least
reason
to
suppose
that
any
such
person
as
christian
rosenkreutz
ever
existed
the
illuminatus
von
knigge
in
the
eighteenth
century
asserted
that
it
is
now
recognized
amongst
enlightened
men
that
no
real
rosicrucians
have
existed
but
that
the
whole
of
what
is
contained
in
the
and
the
reformation
of
the
another
rosicrucian
pamphlet
which
appeared
in
the
same
year
was
only
a
subtle
allegory
of
valentine
andrea
of
which
afterwards
partly
deceivers
such
as
the
jesuits
and
partly
visionaries
made
use
in
order
to
realize
this
dream
what
then
was
the
origin
of
the
name
according
to
one
rosicrucian
tradition
the
word
rose
does
not
derive
from
the
flower
depicted
on
the
rosicrucian
cross
but
from
the
latin
word
signifying
dew
which
was
supposed
to
be
the
most
powerful
solvent
of
gold
whilst
the
cross
was
the
chemical
hieroglyphic
for
light
it
is
said
that
the
rosicrucians
interpreted
the
initials
on
the
cross
inri
by
the
sentence
igne
nitrum
roris
invenitur
supposing
this
derivation
to
be
correct
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
whether
any
connexion
could
be
traced
between
the
first
appearance
of
the
word
rosie
cross
in
the
at
the
date
of
and
the
cabalistic
treatise
of
the
celebrated
rabbi
of
prague
shabbethai
sheftel
horowitz
entitled
that
is
to
say
the
effusion
of
dew
which
appeared
in
although
this
book
has
often
been
reprinted
no
copy
is
to
be
found
in
the
british
museum
so
i
am
unable
to
pursue
this
line
of
enquiry
further
a
simpler
explanation
may
be
that
the
rosy
cross
derived
from
the
red
cross
of
the
templars
mirabeau
who
as
a
freemason
and
an
illuminatus
was
in
a
position
to
discover
many
facts
about
the
secret
societies
of
germany
during
his
stay
in
the
country
definitely
asserts
that
the
rose
croix
masons
of
the
seventeenth
century
were
only
the
ancient
order
of
the
templars
secretly
perpetuated
lecouteulx
de
canteleu
is
more
explicit
in
france
the
knights
templar
who
left
the
order
henceforth
hidden
and
so
to
speak
unknown
formed
the
order
of
the
flaming
star
and
of
the
which
in
the
fifteenth
century
spread
itself
in
bohemia
and
silesia
every
grand
officer
of
these
orders
had
all
his
life
to
wear
the
red
cross
and
to
repeat
every
day
the
prayer
of
st
bernard
eckert
states
that
the
ritual
symbols
and
names
of
the
were
borrowed
from
the
templars
and
that
the
order
was
divided
into
seven
degrees
according
to
the
seven
days
of
creation
at
the
same
time
signifying
that
their
principal
aim
was
that
of
the
mysterious
the
investigation
of
being
and
of
the
forces
of
nature
the
rosicrucian
kenneth
mackenzie
in
his
appears
to
suggest
the
same
possibility
of
templar
origin
under
the
heading
of
rosicrucians
he
refers
enigmatically
to
an
invisible
fraternity
that
has
existed
from
very
ancient
times
as
early
as
the
days
of
the
crusades
bound
by
solemn
obligations
of
impenetrable
secrecy
and
joining
together
in
work
for
humanity
and
to
glorify
the
good
at
various
periods
of
history
this
body
has
emerged
into
a
sort
of
temporary
light
but
its
true
name
has
never
transpired
and
is
only
known
to
the
innermost
adepts
and
rulers
of
the
society
the
rosicrucians
of
the
sixteenth
century
finally
disappeared
and
this
invisible
fraternity
from
which
they
had
presumably
emerged
whether
any
such
body
really
existed
or
whether
the
above
account
is
simply
an
attempt
at
mystification
devised
to
excite
curiosity
the
incredulous
may
question
the
writer
here
observes
that
it
would
be
indiscreet
to
say
more
but
elsewhere
he
throws
out
a
hint
that
may
have
some
bearing
on
the
matter
for
in
his
article
on
the
templars
he
says
that
after
the
suppression
of
the
order
it
was
revived
in
a
more
secret
form
and
subsists
to
the
present
day
this
would
exactly
accord
with
mirabeau
statement
that
the
rosicrucians
were
only
the
order
of
the
templars
secretly
perpetuated
moreover
as
we
shall
see
later
according
to
a
legend
preserved
by
the
royal
order
of
scotland
the
degree
of
the
rosy
cross
had
been
instituted
by
that
order
in
conjunction
with
the
templars
in
and
it
would
certainly
be
a
remarkable
coincidence
that
a
man
bearing
the
name
of
rosenkreutz
should
happen
to
have
inaugurated
a
society
founded
like
the
templars
on
eastern
secret
doctrines
during
the
course
of
the
same
century
without
any
connexion
existing
between
the
two
i
would
suggest
then
that
christian
rosenkreutz
was
a
purely
mythical
personage
and
that
the
whole
legend
concerning
his
travels
was
invented
to
disguise
the
real
sources
whence
the
rosicrucians
derived
their
system
which
would
appear
to
have
been
a
compound
of
ancient
esoteric
doctrines
of
arabian
and
syrian
magic
and
of
jewish
cabalism
partly
inherited
from
the
templars
but
reinforced
by
direct
contact
with
cabalistic
jews
in
germany
the
says
mirabeau
were
a
mystical
cabalistic
theological
and
magical
sect
and
rosicrucianism
thus
became
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
generic
title
by
which
everything
of
the
nature
of
cabalism
theosophy
alchemy
astrology
and
mysticism
was
designated
for
this
reason
it
has
been
said
that
they
can
not
be
regarded
as
the
descendants
of
the
templars
waite
in
referring
to
the
alleged
connexion
between
the
templars
and
the
brethren
of
the
rosy
cross
observes
the
templars
were
not
alchemists
they
had
no
scientific
pretensions
and
their
secret
so
far
as
it
can
be
ascertained
was
a
religious
secret
of
an
kind
the
rosicrucians
on
the
other
hand
were
a
learned
society
and
they
were
also
a
christian
sect
the
fact
that
the
templars
do
not
appear
to
have
practised
alchemy
is
beside
the
point
it
is
not
pretended
that
the
rosicrucians
followed
the
templars
in
every
particular
but
that
they
were
the
inheritors
of
a
secret
tradition
passed
on
to
them
by
the
earlier
order
moreover
that
they
were
a
learned
society
or
even
a
society
at
all
is
not
at
all
certain
for
they
would
appear
to
have
possessed
no
organization
like
the
templars
or
the
freemasons
but
to
have
consisted
rather
of
isolated
occultists
bound
together
by
some
tie
of
secret
knowledge
concerning
natural
phenomena
this
secrecy
was
no
doubt
necessary
at
a
period
when
scientific
research
was
liable
to
be
regarded
as
sorcery
but
whether
the
rosicrucians
really
accomplished
anything
is
extremely
doubtful
they
are
said
to
have
been
alchemists
but
did
they
ever
succeed
in
transmuting
metals
they
are
described
as
learned
yet
do
the
pamphlets
emanating
from
the
fraternity
betray
any
proof
of
superior
knowledge
the
chymical
marriage
of
christian
rosenkreutz
which
appeared
in
certainly
appears
to
be
the
purest
nonsense
magical
imaginings
of
the
most
puerile
kind
and
waite
himself
observes
that
the
publication
of
the
and
the
will
not
add
new
lustre
to
the
rosicrucian
reputations
we
are
accustomed
to
regard
the
adepts
of
the
rosy
cross
as
beings
of
sublime
elevation
and
preternatural
physical
powers
masters
of
nature
monarchs
of
the
intellectual
world
but
here
in
their
own
acknowledged
manifestos
they
avow
themselves
a
mere
theosophical
offshoot
of
the
lutheran
heresy
acknowledging
the
spiritual
supremacy
of
a
temporal
prince
and
calling
the
pope
we
find
them
intemperate
in
their
language
rabid
in
their
religious
prejudices
and
instead
of
towering
above
the
intellectual
average
of
their
age
we
see
them
buffeted
by
the
same
passions
and
identified
with
all
opinions
of
the
men
by
whom
they
were
environed
the
voice
which
addresses
us
behind
the
mystical
mask
of
the
does
not
come
from
an
intellectual
throne
so
much
for
the
rosicrucians
as
a
learned
society
what
then
of
their
claim
to
be
a
christian
body
the
rosicrucian
student
of
the
cabala
julius
sperber
in
his
of
the
divinely
illuminated
fraternity
of
the
admirable
order
of

has
indicated
the
place
assigned
to
christ
by
the
rosicrucians
in
de
quincey
words
having
maintained
the
probability
of
the
rosicrucian
pretensions
on
the
ground
that
such
had
from
the
creation
downwards
been
confided
to
the
keeping
of
a
few
individuals
agreeably
to
which
he
affirms
that
adam
was
the
first
rosicrucian
of
the
old
testament
and
simeon
the
last
he
goes
on
to
ask
whether
the
gospel
put
an
end
to
the
secret
tradition
by
no
means
he
answers
christ

a
new
college
of

among
his
disciples
and
the
greater
mysteries
were
revealed
to
john
and
paul
john
yarker
quoting
this
passage
adds
this
brother
findel
points
out
was
a
claim
of
the
carpocratian
gnostics
it
was
also
as
we
have
seen
a
part
of
the
johannite
tradition
which
is
said
to
have
been
imparted
to
the
templars
we
shall
find
the
same
idea
of
christ
as
an
initiate
running
all
through
the
secret
societies
up
to
the
present
day
these
doctrines
not
unnaturally
brought
on
the
rosicrucians
the
suspicion
of
being
an
body
the
writer
of
a
contemporary
pamphlet
published
in
declares
that
this
fraternity
is
a
stratagem
of
the
jews
and
cabalistic
hebrews
in
whose
philosophy
says
pic
de
la
mirandole
all
things
are
as
if
hidden
in
the
majesty
of
truth
or
as
in
very
sacred
mysteries
another
work
of
the
unknown
and
novel
cabala
of
the
brethren
of
the
agrees
with
the
assertion
that
the
chief
of
this
execrable
college
is
satan
that
its
first
rule
is
denial
of
god
blasphemy
against
the
most
simple
and
undivided
trinity
trampling
on
the
mysteries
of
the
redemption
spitting
in
the
face
of
the
mother
of
god
and
of
all
the
saints
the
sect
is
further
accused
of
compacts
with
the
devil
sacrifices
of
children
of
cherishing
toads
making
poisonous
powders
dancing
with
fiends
etc
now
although
all
this
would
appear
to
be
quite
incompatible
with
the
character
of
the
rosicrucians
as
far
as
it
is
known
we
have
already
seen
that
the
practices
here
described
were
by
no
means
imaginary
in
this
same
seventeenth
century
when
the
fame
of
the
rosicrucians
was
first
noised
abroad
black
magic
was
still
as
in
the
days
of
gilles
de
rais
a
horrible
reality
not
only
in
france
but
in
england
scotland
and
germany
where
sorcerers
of
both
sexes
were
continually
put
to
death
however
much
we
may
deplore
the
methods
employed
against
these
people
or
question
the
supernatural
origin
of
their
cult
it
would
be
idle
to
deny
that
the
cult
itself
existed
moreover
towards
the
end
of
the
century
it
assumed
in
france
a
very
tangible
form
in
the
series
of
mysterious
dramas
known
as
the
affaire
des
poisons
of
which
the
first
act
took
place
in
when
the
celebrated
marquise
de
brinvilliers
embarked
on
her
amazing
career
of
crime
in
collaboration
with
her
lover
this
extraordinary
woman
who
for
ten
years
made
a
hobby
of
trying
the
effects
of
various
slow
poisons
on
her
nearest
relations
thereby
causing
the
death
of
her
father
and
brothers
might
appear
to
have
been
merely
an
isolated
criminal
of
the
abnormal
type
but
for
the
sequel
to
her
exploits
in
the
epidemic
of
poisoning
which
followed
and
during
twenty
years
kept
paris
in
a
state
of
terror
the
investigations
of
the
police
finally
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
whole
band
of
magicians
and
alchemists
a
vast
ramification
of
malefactors
covering
all
france
who
specialized
in
the
art
of
poisoning
without
fear
of
detection
concerning
all
these
sorcerers
alchemists
compounders
of
magical
powders
and
philtres
frightful
rumours
circulated
pacts
with
the
devil
were
talked
of
sacrifices
of
babies
incantations
sacrilegious
masses
and
other
practices
as
disquieting
as
they
were
lugubrious
even
the
king
mistress
madame
de
montespan
is
said
to
have
had
recourse
to
black
masses
in
order
to
retain
the
royal
favour
through
the
agency
of
the
celebrated
sorceress
la
voisin
with
whom
she
was
later
implicated
in
an
accusation
of
having
attempted
the
life
of
the
king
all
the
extraordinary
details
of
these
events
have
recently
been
described
in
the
book
of
madame
latour
where
the
intimate
connexion
between
the
poisoners
and
the
magicians
is
shown
in
the
opinion
of
contemporaries
these
were
not
isolated
individuals
their
methods
were
too
certain
their
execution
of
crime
too
skilful
and
too
easy
for
them
not
to
have
belonged
either
directly
or
indirectly
to
a
whole
organization
of
criminals
who
prepared
the
way
and
studied
the
method
of
giving
to
crime
the
appearance
of
illness
of
forming
in
a
word
a
school
the
author
of
the
work
here
quoted
draws
an
interesting
parallel
between
this
organization
and
the
modern
traffic
in
cocaine
and
goes
on
to
describe
the
three
degrees
into
which
it
was
divided
firstly
the
heads
cultivated
and
intelligent
men
who
understood
chemistry
physics
and
nearly
all
useful
sciences
invisible
counsellors
but
supreme
without
whom
the
sorcerers
and
diviners
would
have
been
powerless
secondly
the
visible
magicians
employing
mysterious
processes
complicated
rites
and
terrifying
ceremonies
and
thirdly
the
crowd
of
nobles
and
plebeians
who
flocked
to
the
doors
of
the
sorcerers
and
filled
their
pockets
in
return
for
magic
potions
philtres
and
in
certain
cases
insidious
poisons
thus
la
voisin
must
be
placed
in
the
second
category
in
spite
of
her
luxury
her
profits
and
her
fame
she
is
only
a
subaltern
agent
in
this
vast
organization
of
criminals
she
depends
entirely
for
her
great
enterprises
on
the
intellectual
chiefs
of
the
corporation
who
were
these
intellectual
chiefs
the
man
who
first
initiated
madame
de
brinvilliers
lover
into
the
art
of
poisoning
was
an
italian
named
exili
or
eggidi
but
the
real
initiate
from
whom
eggidi
and
another
italian
poisoner
had
learnt
their
secrets
is
said
to
have
been
glaser
variously
described
as
a
german
or
a
swiss
chemist
who
followed
the
principles
of
paracelsus
and
occupied
the
post
of
physician
to
the
king
and
the
duc
this
man
about
whose
history
little
is
known
might
thus
have
been
a
kind
of
rosicrucian
for
since
as
has
been
said
the
intellectual
chiefs
from
whom
the
poisoners
derived
their
inspiration
were
men
versed
in
chemistry
in
science
in
physics
and
the
treatment
of
diseases
and
since
further
they
included
alchemists
and
people
professing
to
be
in
possession
of
the
philosopher
stone
their
resemblance
with
the
rosicrucians
is
at
once
apparent
indeed
in
turning
back
to
the
branches
of
magic
enumerated
by
the
rosicrucian
robert
fludd
we
find
not
only
natural
magic
that
most
occult
and
secret
department
of
physics
by
which
the
mystical
properties
of
natural
substances
are
extracted
but
also
venefic
magic
which
is
familiar
with
potions
philtres
and
with
various
preparations
of
poisons
the
art
of
poisoning
was
therefore
known
to
the
rosicrucians
and
although
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
it
was
ever
practised
by
the
heads
of
the
fraternity
it
is
possible
that
the
inspirers
of
the
poisoners
may
have
been
perverted
rosicrucians
that
is
to
say
students
of
those
portions
of
the
cabala
relating
to
magic
both
of
the
necromantic
and
venefic
varieties
who
turned
the
scientific
knowledge
which
the
fraternity
of
the
rosy
cross
used
for
healing
to
a
precisely
opposite
and
deadly
purpose
this
would
explain
the
fact
that
contemporaries
like
the
author
of
the
of
the
unknown
and
novel
cabala
of
the
brethren
of
the
should
identify
these
brethren
with
the
magicians
and
believe
them
to
be
guilty
of
practices
deriving
from
the
same
source
as
rosicrucian
knowledge
the
cabala
of
the
jews
their
modern
admirers
would
of
course
declare
that
they
were
the
poles
asunder
the
difference
being
between
white
and
black
magic
huysmans
however
scoffs
at
this
distinction
and
says
the
use
of
the
term
white
magic
was
a
ruse
of
the
but
of
the
real
doctrines
of
the
rosicrucians
no
one
can
speak
with
certainty
the
whole
story
of
the
fraternity
is
wrapped
in
mystery
mystery
was
avowedly
the
essence
of
their
system
their
identity
their
aims
their
doctrines
are
said
to
have
been
kept
a
profound
secret
from
the
world
indeed
it
is
said
that
no
real
rosicrucian
ever
allowed
himself
to
be
known
as
such
as
a
result
of
this
systematic
method
of
concealment
sceptics
on
the
one
hand
have
declared
the
rosicrucians
to
have
been
charlatans
and
impostors
or
have
denied
their
very
existence
whilst
on
the
other
hand
romancers
have
exalted
them
as
depositaries
of
supernatural
wisdom
the
question
is
further
obscured
by
the
fact
that
most
accounts
of
the
fraternity
as
for
example
those
of
eliphas
lévi
hargrave
jennings
kenneth
mackenzie
waite
wynn
westcott
and
cadbury
jones
are
the
work
of
men
claiming
or
believing
themselves
to
be
initiated
into
rosicrucianism
or
other
occult
systems
of
a
kindred
nature
and
as
such
in
possession
of
peculiar
and
exclusive
knowledge
this
pretension
may
at
once
be
dismissed
as
an
absurdity
nothing
is
easier
than
for
anyone
to
make
a
compound
out
of
jewish
cabalism
and
eastern
theosophy
and
to
label
it
rosicrucianism
but
no
proof
whatever
exists
of
any
affiliation
between
the
rosicrucians
of
and
the
brothers
of
the
rosy
cross
in
spite
of
wake
claim
the
real
history
of
the
rosicrucians
still
remains
to
be
written
at
any
rate
in
the
english
language
the
book
he
has
published
under
this
name
is
merely
a
superficial
study
of
the
question
largely
composed
of
reprints
of
rosicrucian
pamphlets
accessible
to
any
student
wigston
and
pott
merely
echo
waite
thus
everything
that
has
been
published
hitherto
consists
in
the
repetition
of
rosicrucian
legends
or
in
unsubstantiated
theorizings
on
their
doctrines
what
we
need
are
facts
we
want
to
know
who
were
the
early
rosicrucians
when
the
fraternity
originated
and
what
were
its
real
aims
these
researches
must
be
made
not
by
an
occultist
weaving
his
own
theories
into
the
subject
but
by
a
historian
free
from
any
prejudices
for
or
against
the
order
capable
of
weighing
evidence
and
bringing
a
judicial
mind
to
bear
on
the
material
to
be
found
in
the
libraries
of
the
continent
notably
the
bibliothèque
de
in
paris
such
a
work
would
be
a
valuable
contribution
to
the
history
of
secret
societies
in
our
country
but
if
the
continental
brethren
of
the
form
but
a
shadowy
group
of
invisibles
whose
identity
yet
remains
a
mystery
the
english
adepts
of
the
order
stand
forth
in
the
light
of
day
as
philosophers
well
known
to
their
age
and
country
that
francis
bacon
was
initiated
into
rosicrucianism
is
now
recognized
by
freemasons
but
a
more
definite
link
with
the
rosicrucians
of
the
continent
was
robert
fludd
who
after
travelling
for
six
years
in
france
germany
italy
and
spain
where
he
formed
connexions
with
jewish
cabalists
was
visited
by
the
german
jew
rosicrucian
michel
maier
doctor
to
the
emperor
rudolf
by
whom
he
appears
to
have
been
initiated
into
further
mysteries
in
fludd
published
his
defending
the
rosicrucians
against
the
charges
of
detestable
magic
and
diabolical
superstition
brought
against
them
by
libavius
twelve
years
later
fludd
was
attacked
by
father
mersenne
to
whom
a
reply
was
made
by
fludd
or
a
friend
of
fludd
containing
a
further
defence
of
the
order
the
book
says
waite
treats
of
the
noble
art
of
magic
the
foundation
and
nature
of
the
cabala
the
essence
of
veritable
alchemy
and
of
the
causa
fratrum
rosae
crucis
it
identifies
the
palace
or
home
of
the
rosicrucians
with
the
scriptural
house
of
wisdom
in
further
works
by
english
writers
the
eastern
origin
of
the
fraternity
is
insisted
on
thus
thomas
vaughan
known
as
eugenius
philalethes
writing
in
praise
of
the
rosicrucians
in
says
that
their
knowledge
at
first
was
not
purchased
by
their
own
disquisitions
for
they
received
it
from
the
arabians
amongst
whom
it
remained
as
the
monument
and
legacy
of
the
children
of
the
east
nor
is
this
at
all
improbable
for
the
eastern
countries
have
been
always
famous
for
magical
and
secret
societies
another
apologist
of
the
rosicrucians
john
heydon
who
travelled
in
egypt
persia
and
arabia
is
described
by
a
contemporary
as
having
been
in
many
strange
places
among
the
rosie
crucians
and
at
their
castles
holy
houses
temples
sepulchres
sacrifices
heydon
himself
whilst
declaring
that
he
is
not
a
rosicrucian
says
that
he
knows
members
of
the
fraternity
and
its
secrets
that
they
are
sons
of
moses
and
that
this
rosie
crucian
physick
or
medicine
i
happily
and
unexpectedly
alight
upon
in
arabia
these
references
to
castles
temples
sacrifices
encountered
in
egypt
persia
and
arabia
inevitably
recall
memories
of
both
templars
and
ismailis
is
there
no
connexion
between
the
invisible
mountains
of
the
brethren
referred
to
elsewhere
by
heydon
and
the
mountains
of
the
assassins
and
the
freemasons
between
the
scriptural
house
of
wisdom
and
the
or
grand
lodge
of
cairo
the
model
for
western
masonic
lodges
it
is
as
the
precursors
of
the
crisis
which
arose
in
that
the
english
rosicrucians
of
the
seventeenth
century
are
of
supreme
importance
no
longer
need
we
concern
ourselves
with
shadowy
brethren
laying
dubious
claim
to
supernatural
wisdom
but
with
a
concrete
association
of
professed
initiates
proclaiming
their
existence
to
the
world
under
the
name
of
freemasonry
origins
of
freemasonry
the
origin
of
freemasonry
says
a
masonic
writer
of
the
eighteenth
century
is
known
to
freemasons
alone
if
this
was
once
the
case
it
is
so
no
longer
for
although
the
question
would
certainly
appear
to
be
one
on
which
the
initiated
should
be
most
qualified
to
speak
the
fact
is
that
no
official
theory
on
the
origin
of
freemasonry
exists
the
great
mass
of
the
freemasons
do
know
or
care
to
know
anything
about
the
history
of
their
order
whilst
masonic
authorities
are
entirely
disagreed
on
the
matter
mackey
admits
that
the
origin
and
source
whence
first
sprang
the
institution
of
freemasonry
has
given
rise
to
more
difference
of
opinion
and
discussion
among
masonic
scholars
than
any
other
topic
in
the
literature
of
the
institution
nor
is
this
ignorance
maintained
merely
in
books
for
the
general
public
since
in
those
specially
addressed
to
the
craft
and
at
discussions
in
lodges
the
same
diversity
of
opinion
prevails
and
no
decisive
conclusions
appear
to
be
reached
thus
albert
churchward
a
freemason
of
the
thirtieth
degree
who
deplores
the
small
amount
of
interest
taken
in
this
matter
by
masons
in
general
observes
hitherto
there
have
been
so
many
contradictory
opinions
and
theories
in
the
attempt
to
supply
the
origin
and
the
reason
whence
where
and
why
the
brotherhood
of
freemasonry
came
into
existence
and
all
the
different
parts
and
various
rituals
of
the
different
degrees
all
that
has
been
written
on
this
has
hitherto
been
without
any
facts
for
their
fundation
in
the
absence
therefore
of
any
origin
universally
recognized
by
the
craft
it
is
surely
open
to
the
lay
mind
to
speculate
on
the
matter
and
to
draw
conclusions
from
history
as
to
which
of
the
many
explanations
put
forward
seems
to
supply
the
key
to
the
mystery
according
to
the
masonic
no
less
than
twelve
theories
have
been
advanced
as
to
the
origins
of
the
order
namely
that
masonry
derived
from
the
patriarchs
from
the
mysteries
of
the
pagans
from
the
construction
of
solomon
temple
from
the
crusades
from
the
knights
templar
from
the
roman
collegia
of
artificers
from
the
operative
masons
of
the
middle
ages
from
the
rosicrucians
of
the
sixteenth
century
from
oliver
cromwell
from
prince
charles
stuart
for
political
purposes
from
sir
christopher
wren
at
the
building
of
paul
from
desaguliers
and
his
friends
in
this
enumeration
is
however
misleading
for
it
implies
that
in
of
these
various
theories
the
true
origin
of
freemasonry
may
be
found
in
reality
modern
freemasonry
is
a
dual
system
a
blend
of
two
distinct
traditions
of
operative
masonry
that
is
to
say
the
actual
art
of
building
and
of
speculative
theory
on
the
great
truths
of
life
and
death
as
a
freemason
the
count
goblet
has
expressed
it
speculative
masonry
that
is
to
say
the
dual
system
we
now
know
as
freemasonry
is
the
legitimate
offspring
of
a
fruitful
union
between
the
professional
guild
of
mediæval
masons
and
of
a
secret
group
of
philosophical
adepts
the
first
having
furnished
the
form
and
the
second
the
spirit
in
studying
the
origins
of
the
present
system
we
have
therefore
to
examine
separately
the
history
of
each
of
these
two
traditions
and
to
discover
their
point
of
junction
operative
masonry
beginning
with
the
first
of
these
two
traditions
we
find
that
guilds
of
working
masons
existed
in
very
ancient
times
without
going
back
as
far
as
ancient
egypt
or
greece
which
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
the
present
work
the
course
of
these
associations
may
be
traced
throughout
the
history
of
western
europe
from
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
according
to
certain
masonic
writers
the
druids
originally
came
from
egypt
and
brought
with
them
traditions
relating
to
the
art
of
building
the
who
later
on
established
schools
and
colleges
in
this
country
for
the
teaching
of
arts
sciences
and
handicrafts
are
said
to
have
derived
from
the
druids
but
a
more
probable
source
of
inspiration
in
the
art
of
building
are
the
romans
who
established
the
famous
collegia
of
architects
referred
to
in
the
list
of
alternative
theories
given
in
the
advocates
of
the
roman
collegia
origin
of
freemasonry
might
be
right
as
far
as
operative
masonry
is
concerned
for
it
is
to
the
period
following
on
the
roman
occupation
of
britain
that
our
masonic
guilds
can
with
the
greatest
degree
of
certainty
be
traced
owing
to
the
importance
the
art
of
building
now
acquired
it
is
said
that
many
distinguished
men
such
as
alban
king
alfred
king
edwin
and
king
athelstan
were
numbered
amongst
its
patrons
so
that
in
time
the
guilds
came
to
occupy
the
position
of
privileged
bodies
and
were
known
as
free
corporations
further
that
york
was
the
first
masonic
centre
in
england
largely
under
the
control
of
the
culdees
who
at
the
same
period
exercised
much
influence
over
the
masonic
collegia
in
scotland
at
kilwinning
melrose
and
aberdeen
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
all
this
is
speculation
no
documentary
evidence
has
ever
been
produced
to
prove
the
existence
of
masonic
guilds
before
the
famous
york
charter
of
and
even
the
date
of
this
document
is
doubtful
only
with
the
period
of
gothic
architecture
do
we
reach
firm
ground
that
guilds
of
working
masons
known
in
france
as
compagnonnages
and
in
germany
as
steinmetzen
did
then
form
close
corporations
and
possibly
possess
secrets
connected
with
their
profession
is
more
than
probable
that
in
consequence
of
their
skill
in
building
the
magnificent
cathedrals
of
this
period
they
now
came
to
occupy
a
privileged
position
seems
fairly
certain
the
abbé
grandidier
writing
from
strasbourg
in
traces
the
whole
system
of
freemasonry
from
these
german
guilds
this
society
of
freemasons
is
nothing
but
a
servile
imitation
of
an
ancient
and
useful
of
real
masons
whose
headquarters
was
formerly
at
strasbourg
and
of
which
the
constitution
was
confirmed
by
the
emperor
maximilian
in
as
far
as
it
is
possible
to
discover
from
the
scanty
documentary
evidence
the
fourteenth
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
provide
the
same
privileges
appear
to
have
been
accorded
to
the
guilds
of
working
masons
in
england
and
scotland
which
although
presided
over
by
powerful
nobles
and
apparently
on
occasion
admitting
members
from
outside
the
craft
remained
essentially
operative
bodies
nevertheless
we
find
the
assemblies
of
masons
suppressed
by
act
of
parliament
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
henry
vi
and
later
on
an
armed
force
sent
by
queen
elizabeth
to
break
up
the
annual
grand
lodge
at
york
it
is
possible
that
the
fraternity
merely
by
the
secrecy
with
which
it
was
surrounded
excited
the
suspicions
of
authority
for
nothing
could
be
more
than
its
published
statutes
masons
were
to
be
true
men
to
god
and
the
holy
church
also
to
the
masters
that
they
served
they
were
to
be
honest
in
their
manner
of
life
and
to
do
no
villainy
whereby
the
craft
or
the
science
may
be
slandered
yet
the
writer
plot
in
his
history
of
expresses
some
suspicion
with
regard
to
the
secrets
of
freemasonry
that
these
could
not
be
merely
trade
secrets
relating
to
the
art
of
building
but
that
already
some
speculative
element
had
been
introduced
to
the
lodges
seems
the
more
probable
from
the
fact
that
by
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
not
only
noble
patrons
headed
the
craft
but
ordinary
gentlemen
entirely
unconnected
with
building
were
received
into
the
fraternity
the
entry
in
the
diary
of
elias
ashmole
under
the
date
of
october
clearly
proves
this
fact
i
was
made
a
freemason
at
warrington
in
lancashire
with
henry
mainwaring
of
karticham
in
cheshire
the
names
of
those
that
were
then
of
the
lodge
rich
penket
warden
james
collier
rich
sankey
henry
littler
john
ellam
rich
ellam
and
hugh
brewer
it
is
now
ascertained
says
yarker
that
the
majority
of
the
members
present
were
not
operative
masons
again
in
ashmole
relates
that
he
attended
a
meeting
held
at
mason
hall
in
london
where
with
a
number
of
other
gentlemen
he
was
admitted
into
the
fellowship
of
the
freemasons
that
is
to
say
into
the
second
degree
we
have
then
clear
proof
that
already
in
the
seventeenth
century
freemasonry
had
ceased
to
be
an
association
composed
exclusively
of
men
concerned
with
building
although
eminent
architects
ranked
high
in
the
order
inigo
jones
is
said
to
have
been
grand
master
under
james
i
and
sir
christopher
wren
to
have
occupied
the
same
position
from
about
to
but
it
was
not
until
that
the
lodge
of
paul
in
london
officially
announced
that
the
privileges
of
masonry
should
no
longer
be
restricted
to
operative
masons
but
extended
to
men
of
various
professions
provided
they
were
regularly
approved
and
initiated
into
the
order
this
was
followed
in
by
the
great
when
grand
lodge
was
founded
and
speculative
masonry
which
we
now
know
as
freemasonry
was
established
on
a
settled
basis
with
a
ritual
rules
and
constitution
drawn
up
in
due
form
it
is
at
this
important
date
that
the
official
history
of
freemasonry
begins
but
before
pursuing
the
course
of
the
order
through
what
is
known
as
the
grand
lodge
era
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
and
enquire
into
the
origins
of
the
philosophy
that
was
now
combined
with
the
system
of
operative
masonry
this
is
the
point
on
which
opinions
are
divided
and
to
which
the
various
theories
summarized
in
the
relate
let
us
examine
each
of
these
in
turn
speculative
masonry
according
to
certain
sceptics
concerning
the
mysteries
of
freemasonry
the
system
inaugurated
in
had
no
existence
before
that
date
but
was
devised
promulgated
and
palmed
upon
the
world
by
desaguliers
anderson
and
others
who
then
founded
the
grand
lodge
of
england
paton
in
an
admirable
little
pamphlet
has
shown
the
futility
of
this
contention
and
also
the
injustice
of
representing
the
founders
of
grand
lodge
as
perpetrating
so
gross
a
deception
this
theory
ascribes
to
men
of
the
highest
character
the
invention
of
a
system
of
mere
imposture
it
was
brought
forward
with
pretensions
which
its
framers
knew
to
be
false
pretensions
of
high
antiquity
whereas
it
had
newly
been
invented
in
their
studies
is
this
likely
or
is
it
reasonable
to
ascribe
such
conduct
to
honourable
men
without
even
assigning
a
probable
motive
for
it
we
have
indeed
only
to
study
masonic
ritual
which
is
open
to
everyone
to
read
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion
that
there
could
be
no
motive
for
this
imposture
and
further
that
these
two
clergymen
can
not
be
supposed
to
have
evolved
the
whole
thing
out
of
their
heads
obviously
some
movement
of
a
kindred
nature
must
have
led
up
to
this
crisis
and
since
elias
ashmole
diary
clearly
proves
that
a
ceremony
of
masonic
initiation
had
existed
in
the
preceding
century
it
is
surely
only
reasonable
to
conclude
that
drs
anderson
and
desaguliers
revised
but
did
not
originate
the
ritual
and
constitutions
drawn
up
by
them
now
although
the
ritual
of
freemasonry
is
couched
in
modern
and
by
no
means
classical
english
the
ideas
running
through
it
certainly
bear
traces
of
extreme
antiquity
the
central
idea
of
freemasonry
concerning
a
loss
which
has
befallen
man
and
the
hope
of
its
ultimate
recovery
is
in
fact
no
other
than
the
ancient
secret
tradition
described
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
book
certain
masonic
writers
indeed
ascribe
to
freemasonry
precisely
the
same
genealogy
as
that
of
the
early
cabala
declaring
that
it
descended
from
adam
and
the
first
patriarchs
of
the
human
race
and
thence
through
groups
of
wise
men
amongst
the
egyptians
chaldeans
persians
and
greeks
albert
churchward
insists
particularly
on
the
egyptian
origin
of
the
speculative
element
in
freemasonry
brother
gould
and
other
freemasons
will
never
understand
the
meaning
and
origin
of
our
sacred
tenets
till
they
have
studied
and
unlocked
the
mysteries
of
the
past
this
study
will
then
reveal
the
fact
that
the
druids
the
gymnosophists
of
india
the
magi
of
persia
and
the
chaldeans
of
assyria
had
all
the
same
religious
rites
and
ceremonies
as
practised
by
their
priests
who
were
initiated
to
their
order
and
that
these
were
solemnly
sworn
to
keep
the
doctrines
a
profound
secret
from
the
rest
of
mankind
all
these
flowed
from
one
source
egypt
churchward
further
quotes
the
speech
of
the
rev
william
dodd
at
the
opening
of
a
masonic
temple
in
who
traced
freemasonry
from
the
first
astronomers
on
the
plains
of
chaldea
the
wise
and
mystic
kings
and
priests
of
egypt
the
sages
of
greece
and
philosophers
of
rome
etc
but
how
did
these
traditions
descend
to
the
masons
of
the
west
according
to
a
large
body
of
masonic
opinion
in
this
country
which
recognizes
only
a
single
source
of
inspiration
to
the
system
we
now
know
as
freemasonry
the
speculative
as
well
as
the
operative
traditions
of
the
order
descended
from
the
building
guilds
and
were
imported
to
england
by
means
of
the
roman
collegia
churchward
however
strongly
dissents
from
this
view
in
the
new
and
revised
edition
of
the
perfect
ceremonies
according
to
our
working
a
theory
is
given
that
freemasonry
originated
from
certain
guilds
of
workmen
which
are
well
known
in
history
as
the
roman
college
of
artificers
there
is
no
foundation
of
fact
for
such
a
theory
freemasonry
is
now
and
always
was
an
eschatology
as
may
be
proved
by
the
whole
of
our
signs
symbols
and
words
and
our
rituals
but
what
churchward
fails
to
explain
is
how
this
eschatology
reached
the
working
masons
moreover
why
if
as
he
asserts
it
derived
from
egypt
assyria
india
and
persia
freemasonry
no
longer
bears
the
stamp
of
these
countries
for
although
vestiges
of
sabeism
may
be
found
in
the
decoration
of
the
lodges
and
brief
references
to
the
mysteries
of
egypt
and
phœnicia
to
the
secret
teaching
of
pythagoras
to
euclid
and
to
plato
in
the
ritual
and
instructions
of
the
craft
degrees
nevertheless
the
form
in
which
the
ancient
tradition
is
clothed
the
phraseology
and
employed
are
neither
egyptian
chaldean
greek
nor
persian
but
judaic
thus
although
some
portion
of
the
ancient
secret
tradition
may
have
penetrated
to
great
britain
through
the
druids
or
the
romans
versed
in
the
lore
of
greece
and
egypt
another
channel
for
its
introduction
was
clearly
the
cabala
of
the
jews
certain
masonic
writers
recognize
this
double
tradition
the
one
descending
from
egypt
chaldea
and
greece
the
other
from
the
israelites
and
assert
that
it
is
from
the
latter
source
their
system
is
derived
for
after
tracing
its
origin
from
adam
noah
enoch
and
abraham
they
proceed
to
show
its
line
of
descent
through
moses
david
and
solomon
descent
from
solomon
is
in
fact
officially
recognized
by
the
craft
and
forms
a
part
of
the
instructions
to
candidates
for
initiation
into
the
first
degree
but
as
we
have
already
seen
this
is
the
precise
genealogy
attributed
to
the
cabala
by
the
jews
moreover
modern
freemasonry
is
entirely
built
up
on
the
solomonic
or
rather
the
hiramic
legend
for
the
sake
of
readers
unfamiliar
with
the
ritual
of
freemasonry
a
brief
of
this
grand
legend
must
be
given
here
solomon
when
building
the
temple
employed
the
services
of
a
certain
artificer
in
brass
named
hiram
the
son
of
a
widow
of
the
tribe
of
naphthali
who
was
sent
to
him
by
hiram
king
of
tyre
so
much
we
know
from
the
book
of
kings
but
the
masonic
legend
goes
on
to
relate
that
hiram
the
widow
son
referred
to
as
hiram
abiff
and
described
as
the
met
with
an
untimely
end
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
order
the
masons
working
on
the
temple
were
divided
into
three
classes
entered
apprentices
fellow
crafts
and
master
masons
the
first
two
distinguished
by
different
and
grips
and
paid
at
different
rates
of
wages
the
last
consisting
only
of
three
persons
solomon
himself
hiram
king
of
tyre
who
had
provided
him
with
wood
and
precious
stones
and
hiram
abiff
now
before
the
completion
of
the
temple
fifteen
of
the
fellow
crafts
conspired
together
to
find
out
the
secrets
of
the
master
masons
and
resolved
to
waylay
hiram
abiff
at
the
door
of
the
temple
at
the
last
moment
twelve
of
the
fifteen
drew
back
but
the
remaining
three
carried
out
the
fell
design
and
after
threatening
hiram
in
vain
in
order
to
obtain
the
secrets
killed
him
with
three
blows
on
the
head
delivered
by
each
in
turn
they
then
conveyed
the
body
away
and
buried
it
on
mount
moriah
in
jerusalem
solomon
informed
of
the
disappearance
of
the
sent
out
fifteen
fellow
crafts
to
seek
for
him
five
of
these
having
arrived
at
the
mountain
noticed
a
place
where
the
earth
had
been
disturbed
and
there
discovered
the
body
of
hiram
leaving
a
branch
of
acacia
to
mark
the
spot
they
returned
with
their
story
to
solomon
who
ordered
them
to
go
and
exhume
the
body
an
order
that
was
immediately
carried
out
the
murder
and
exhumation
or
raising
of
hiram
accompanied
by
extraordinary
lamentations
form
the
climax
of
craft
masonry
and
when
it
is
remembered
that
in
all
probability
no
such
tragedy
ever
took
place
that
possibly
no
one
known
as
hiram
abiff
ever
existed
the
whole
story
can
only
be
regarded
as
the
survival
of
some
ancient
cult
relating
not
to
an
actual
event
but
to
an
esoteric
doctrine
a
legend
and
a
ceremony
of
this
kind
is
indeed
to
be
found
in
many
earlier
mythologies
the
story
of
the
murder
of
hiram
had
been
foreshadowed
by
the
egyptian
legend
of
the
murder
of
osiris
and
the
quest
for
his
body
by
isis
whilst
the
lamentations
around
the
tomb
of
hiram
had
a
counterpart
in
the
mourning
ceremonies
for
osiris
and
adonis
both
like
hiram
subsequently
raised
and
later
on
in
that
which
took
place
around
the
catafalque
of
manes
who
like
hiram
was
barbarously
put
to
death
and
is
said
to
have
been
known
to
the
manicheans
as
the
son
of
the
widow
but
in
the
form
given
to
it
by
freemasonry
the
legend
is
purely
judaic
and
would
therefore
appear
to
have
derived
from
the
judaic
version
of
the
ancient
tradition
the
pillars
of
the
temple
jachin
and
boaz
which
play
so
important
a
part
in
craft
masonry
are
symbols
which
occur
in
the
jewish
cabala
where
they
are
described
as
two
of
the
ten
sephiroths
a
writer
of
the
eighteenth
century
referring
to
fyve
curiosities
he
has
discovered
in
scotland
describes
one
as
the
mason
word
which
tho
some
make
a
misterie
of
it
i
will
not
conceal
a
little
of
what
i
know
it
is
lyke
a
rabbinical
tradition
in
way
of
comment
on
jachin
and
boaz
the
two
pillars
erected
in
solomon
temple
with
ane
addition
delyvered
from
hand
to
hand
by
which
they
know
and
become
familiar
one
with
another
this
is
precisely
the
system
by
which
the
cabala
was
handed
down
amongst
the
jews
the
lends
colour
to
the
theory
of
cabalistic
transmission
by
suggesting
that
the
story
of
hiram
may
possibly
trace
back
to
the
rabbinic
legend
concerning
the
temple
of
solomon
that
while
all
the
workmen
were
killed
so
that
they
should
not
build
another
temple
devoted
to
idolatry
hiram
himself
was
raised
to
heaven
like
enoch
how
did
this
rabbinic
legend
find
its
way
into
freemasonry
advocates
of
the
roman
collegia
theory
explain
it
in
the
following
manner
after
the
building
of
the
temple
of
solomon
the
masons
who
had
been
engaged
in
the
work
were
dispersed
and
a
number
made
their
way
to
europe
some
to
marseilles
some
perhaps
to
rome
where
they
may
have
introduced
judaic
legends
to
the
collegia
which
then
passed
on
to
the
comacini
masters
of
the
seventh
century
and
from
these
to
the
mediæval
working
guilds
of
england
france
and
germany
it
is
said
that
during
the
middle
ages
a
story
concerning
the
temple
of
solomon
was
current
amongst
the
of
france
in
one
of
these
groups
known
as
the
children
of
solomon
the
legend
of
hiram
appears
to
have
existed
much
in
its
present
form
according
to
another
group
the
victim
of
the
murder
was
not
hiram
abiff
but
one
of
his
companions
named
maître
jacques
who
whilst
engaged
with
hiram
on
the
construction
of
the
temple
met
his
death
at
the
hands
of
five
wicked
fellow
crafts
instigated
by
a
sixth
the
père
soubise
but
the
date
at
which
this
legend
originated
is
unknown
clavel
thinks
that
the
hebraic
mysteries
existed
as
early
as
the
roman
collegia
which
he
describes
as
largely
judaized
yarker
expresses
precisely
the
opposite
view
it
is
not
so
difficult
to
connect
freemasonry
with
the
collegia
the
difficulty
lies
in
attributing
jewish
traditions
to
the
collegia
and
we
say
on
the
evidence
of
the
oldest
charges
that
such
traditions
had
no
existence
in
saxon
times
again
so
far
as
this
country
is
concerned
we
know
nothing
from
documents
of
a
masonry
dating
from
solomon
temple
until
after
the
crusades
when
the
constitution
believed
to
have
been
sanctioned
by
king
athelstan
gradually
underwent
a
change
in
a
discussion
which
took
place
recently
at
the
quatuor
coronati
lodge
the
hiramic
legend
could
only
be
traced
back
and
then
without
absolute
certainty
to
the
fourteenth
century
which
would
coincide
with
the
date
indicated
by
yarker
up
to
this
period
the
lore
of
the
masonic
guilds
appears
to
have
contained
only
the
exoteric
doctrines
of
egypt
and
greece
which
may
have
reached
them
through
the
roman
collegia
whilst
the
traditions
of
masonry
are
traced
from
adam
jabal
tubal
cain
from
nimrod
and
the
tower
of
babel
with
hermes
and
pythagoras
as
their
more
immediate
progenitors
these
doctrines
were
evidently
in
the
main
geometrical
or
technical
and
in
no
sense
cabalistic
there
is
therefore
some
justification
for
eckert
statement
that
the
mysteries
were
not
yet
introduced
into
the
masonic
corporations
nowhere
can
we
find
the
least
trace
of
them
nowhere
do
we
find
any
classification
not
even
that
of
masters
and
apprentices
we
observe
no
symbol
of
the
temple
of
solomon
all
their
symbolism
relates
to
masonic
labours
and
to
a
few
philosophical
maxims
of
morality
the
date
at
which
eckert
like
yarker
places
the
introduction
of
these
judaic
elements
is
the
time
of
the
crusades
but
whilst
recognizing
that
modern
craft
masonry
is
largely
founded
on
the
cabala
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
between
the
different
cabalas
for
by
this
date
no
less
than
three
cabalas
appear
to
have
existed
firstly
the
ancient
secret
tradition
of
the
patriarchs
handed
down
from
the
egyptians
through
the
greeks
and
romans
and
possibly
through
the
roman
collegia
to
the
craft
masons
of
britain
secondly
the
jewish
version
of
this
tradition
the
first
cabala
of
the
jews
in
no
way
incompatible
with
christianity
descending
from
moses
david
and
solomon
to
the
essenes
and
the
more
enlightened
jews
and
thirdly
the
perverted
cabala
mingled
by
the
rabbis
with
magic
barbaric
superstitions
and
after
the
death
of
christ
with
legends
whatever
cabalistic
elements
were
introduced
into
craft
masonry
at
the
time
of
the
crusades
appear
to
have
belonged
to
the
second
of
these
traditions
the
unperverted
cabala
of
the
jews
known
to
the
essenes
there
are
in
fact
striking
resemblances
betwen
freemasonry
and
essenism
degrees
of
initiation
oaths
of
secrecy
the
wearing
of
the
apron
and
a
certain
masonic
sign
whilst
to
the
sabeist
traditions
of
the
essenes
may
perhaps
be
traced
the
solar
and
stellar
symbolism
of
the
lodges
the
hiramic
legend
may
have
belonged
to
the
same
tradition
the
templar
tradition
if
then
no
documentary
evidence
can
be
brought
forward
to
show
that
either
the
solomonic
legend
or
any
traces
of
judaic
symbolism
and
traditions
existed
either
in
the
monuments
of
the
period
or
in
the
ritual
of
the
masons
before
the
fourteenth
century
it
is
surely
reasonable
to
recognize
the
plausibility
of
the
contention
put
forward
by
a
great
number
of
masonic
writers
particularly
on
the
continent
that
the
judaic
elements
penetrated
into
masonry
by
means
of
the
templars
the
templars
as
we
have
already
seen
had
taken
their
name
from
the
temple
of
solomon
in
jerusalem
what
then
more
likely
than
that
during
the
time
they
had
lived
there
they
had
learnt
the
rabbinical
legends
connected
with
the
temple
according
to
george
sand
who
was
deeply
versed
in
the
history
of
secret
societies
the
hiramic
legend
was
adopted
by
the
templars
as
symbolic
of
the
destruction
of
their
order
they
wept
over
their
impotence
in
the
person
of
hiram
the
word
lost
and
recovered
is
their
empire
the
freemason
ragon
likewise
declares
that
the
catastrophe
they
lamented
was
the
catastrophe
that
destroyed
their
order
further
the
grand
master
whose
fate
they
deplored
was
jacques
du
molay
here
then
we
have
two
bodies
in
france
at
the
same
period
the
templars
and
the
both
possessing
a
legend
concerning
the
temple
of
solomon
and
both
mourning
a
maître
jacques
who
had
been
barbarously
put
to
death
if
we
accept
the
possibility
that
the
hiramic
legend
existed
amongst
the
masons
before
the
crusades
how
are
we
to
explain
this
extraordinary
coincidence
it
is
certainly
easier
to
believe
that
the
judaic
traditions
were
introduced
to
the
masons
by
the
templars
and
grafted
on
to
the
ancient
lore
that
the
masonic
guilds
had
inherited
from
the
roman
collegia
that
some
connexion
existed
between
the
templars
and
the
working
masons
is
indicated
by
the
new
influence
that
entered
into
building
at
this
period
a
modern
freemason
comparing
the
beautifully
designed
and
marks
of
the
true
gothic
period
say
circa
with
the
careless
and
roughly
executed
marks
many
of
them
mere
scratches
of
later
periods
points
out
that
the
knights
templars
rose
and
fell
with
that
wonderful
development
of
architecture
the
same
writer
goes
on
to
show
that
some
of
the
most
important
masonic
symbols
the
equilateral
triangle
and
the
mason
square
surmounting
two
pillars
came
through
from
gothic
times
yarker
asserts
that
the
level
the
flaming
star
and
the
tau
cross
which
have
since
passed
into
the
symbolism
of
freemasonry
may
be
traced
to
the
knights
templar
as
also
the
star
in
salisbury
cathedral
the
double
triangle
in
westminster
abbey
jachin
and
boaz
the
circle
and
the
pentagon
in
the
masonry
of
the
fourteenth
century
yarker
cites
later
in
the
eye
and
crescent
moon
the
three
stars
and
the
ladder
of
five
steps
as
further
evidences
of
templar
influence
the
templars
were
large
builders
and
jacques
du
molay
alleged
the
zeal
of
his
order
in
decorating
churches
in
the
process
against
him
in
hence
the
alleged
connexion
of
templary
and
freemasonry
is
bound
to
have
a
substratum
of
truth
moreover
according
to
a
masonic
tradition
an
alliance
definitely
took
place
between
the
templars
and
the
masonic
guilds
at
this
period
during
the
proceedings
taken
against
the
order
of
the
temple
in
france
it
is
said
that
pierre
and
seven
other
knights
escaped
to
scotland
in
the
guise
of
working
masons
and
landed
in
the
island
of
mull
on
john
day
they
held
their
first
chapter
robert
bruce
then
took
them
under
his
protection
and
seven
years
later
they
fought
under
his
standard
at
bannockburn
against
edward
ii
who
had
suppressed
their
order
in
england
after
this
battle
which
took
place
on
john
the
baptist
day
in
summer
june
robert
bruce
is
said
to
have
instituted
the
royal
order
of
heredom
and
knights
of
the
rosy
cross
these
two
degrees
now
constitute
the
royal
order
of
scotland
and
it
seems
not
improbable
that
in
reality
they
were
brought
to
scotland
by
the
templars
thus
according
to
one
of
the
early
writers
on
freemasonry
the
degree
of
the
originated
with
the
templars
in
palestine
as
early
as
whilst
the
eastern
origin
of
the
word
heredom
supposed
to
derive
from
a
mythical
mountain
on
an
island
south
of
the
hebrides
where
the
culdees
practised
their
rites
is
indicated
by
another
writer
who
traces
it
to
a
jewish
source
in
this
same
year
of
robert
bruce
is
said
to
have
united
the
templars
and
the
royal
order
of
with
the
guilds
of
working
masons
who
had
also
fought
in
his
army
at
the
famous
lodge
of
kilwinning
founded
in
which
now
added
to
its
name
that
of
heredom
and
became
the
chief
seat
of
the
order
scotland
was
essentially
a
home
of
operative
masonry
and
in
view
of
the
templar
prowess
in
the
art
of
building
what
more
natural
than
that
the
two
bodies
should
enter
into
an
alliance
already
in
england
the
temple
is
said
between
and
to
have
administered
the
craft
it
is
thus
at
heredom
of
kilwinning
the
holy
house
of
masonry
mother
kilwinning
as
it
is
still
known
to
freemasons
that
a
speculative
element
of
a
fresh
kind
may
have
found
its
way
into
the
lodges
is
it
not
here
then
that
we
may
see
that
fruitful
union
between
the
professional
guild
of
mediæval
masons
and
a
secret
group
of
philosophical
adepts
alluded
to
by
count
goblet
and
described
by
waite
in
the
following
words
the
mystery
of
the
building
guilds
whatever
it
may
be
held
to
have
been
was
that
of
a
simple
unpolished
pious
and
utilitarian
device
and
this
daughter
of
nature
in
the
absence
of
all
intention
on
her
own
part
underwent
or
was
coerced
into
one
of
the
strangest
marriages
which
has
been
celebrated
in
occult
history
it
so
happened
that
her
particular
form
and
figure
lent
itself
to
such
a
union
waite
with
his
usual
vagueness
does
not
explain
when
and
where
this
marriage
took
place
but
the
account
would
certainly
apply
to
the
alliance
between
the
templars
and
scottish
guilds
of
working
masons
which
as
we
have
seen
is
admitted
by
masonic
authorities
and
presents
exactly
the
conditions
described
the
templars
being
peculiarly
fitted
by
their
initiation
into
the
legend
concerning
the
building
of
the
temple
of
solomon
to
with
the
masons
and
the
masons
being
prepared
by
their
partial
initiation
into
ancient
mysteries
to
receive
the
fresh
influx
of
eastern
tradition
from
the
templars
a
further
indication
of
the
templar
influence
in
craft
masonry
is
the
system
of
degrees
and
initiations
the
names
of
entered
apprentice
fellow
craft
and
master
mason
are
said
to
have
derived
from
scotland
and
the
analogy
between
these
and
the
degrees
of
the
assassins
has
already
been
shown
indeed
the
resemblance
between
the
outer
organization
of
freemasonry
and
the
system
of
the
ismailis
is
shown
by
many
writers
thus
bussell
observes
no
doubt
together
with
some
knowledge
of
geometry
regarded
as
an
esoteric
trade
secret
many
symbols
current
did
pass
down
from
very
primitive
times
but
a
more
certain
model
was
the
grand
lodge
of
the
ismailis
in
cairo
that
is
to
say
the
syed
ameer
ali
also
expresses
the
opinion
that
makrisi
account
of
the
different
degrees
of
initiation
adopted
in
this
lodge
forms
an
invaluable
record
of
freemasonry
in
fact
the
lodge
at
cairo
became
the
model
of
all
the
lodges
created
afterwards
in
christendom
bernard
springett
a
freemason
quoting
this
passage
adds
in
this
last
assertion
i
am
myself
greatly
in
agreement
it
is
surely
therefore
legitimate
to
surmise
that
this
system
penetrated
to
craft
masonry
through
the
templars
whose
connexion
with
the
assassins
offshoot
of
the
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
the
question
of
the
templar
succession
in
freemasonry
forms
perhaps
the
most
controversial
point
in
the
whole
history
of
the
roman
collegia
theory
continental
masons
more
generally
accepting
it
and
even
glorying
in
it
mackey
in
his
of
thus
sums
up
the
matter
the
connexion
between
the
knights
templar
and
the
freemasons
has
been
repeatedly
asserted
by
the
enemies
of
both
institutions
and
has
often
been
admitted
by
their
friends
lawrie
on
this
subject
holds
the
following
language
we
know
that
the
knights
templar
not
only
possessed
the
mysteries
but
performed
the
ceremonies
and
inculcated
the
duties
of
freemasons
and
he
attributes
the
dissolution
of
the
order
to
the
discovery
of
their
being
freemasons
and
their
assembling
in
secret
to
practise
the
rites
of
the
order
this
explains
why
freemasons
have
always
shown
indulgence
to
the
templars
it
was
above
all
freemasonry
says
findel
which
because
it
falsely
held
itself
to
be
a
daughter
of
templarism
took
the
greatest
pains
to
represent
the
order
of
the
templars
as
innocent
and
therefore
free
from
all
mystery
for
this
purpose
not
only
legends
and
unhistorical
facts
were
brought
forward
but
manœuvres
were
also
resorted
to
in
order
to
suppress
the
truth
the
masonic
reverers
of
the
temple
order
bought
up
the
whole
edition
of
the
du
of
moldenhawer
because
this
showed
the
guilt
of
the
order
only
a
few
copies
reached
the
booksellers
already
several
decades
before
the
freemasons
in
their
unhistorical
efforts
had
been
guilty
of
real
forgery
dupuy
had
published
his
of
the
trial
of
the
as
early
as
in
paris
for
which
he
had
made
use
of
the
original
of
the
du
according
to
which
the
guilt
of
the
order
leaves
no
room
for
doubt
but
when
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
several
branches
of
freemasonry
wished
to
recall
the
templar
order
into
being
the
work
of
dupuy
was
naturally
very
displeasing
it
had
already
been
current
amongst
the
public
for
a
hundred
years
so
it
could
no
longer
be
bought
therefore
they
falsified
it
accordingly
in
a
reprint
of
dupuy
work
appeared
with
the
addition
of
a
number
of
notes
and
remarks
and
mutilated
in
such
a
way
as
to
prove
not
the
guilt
but
the
innocence
of
the
templars
now
although
british
masonry
has
played
no
part
in
these
intrigues
the
question
of
the
templar
succession
has
been
very
inadequately
dealt
with
by
the
masonic
writers
of
our
country
as
a
rule
they
have
adopted
one
of
two
courses
either
they
have
persistently
denied
connexion
with
the
templars
or
they
have
represented
them
as
a
blameless
and
cruelly
maligned
order
but
in
reality
neither
of
these
expedients
is
necessary
to
save
the
honour
of
british
masonry
for
not
even
the
bitterest
enemy
of
masonry
has
ever
suggested
that
british
masons
have
adopted
any
portion
of
the
templar
heresy
the
knights
who
fled
to
scotland
may
have
been
perfectly
innocent
of
the
charges
brought
against
their
order
indeed
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
this
was
the
case
thus
the
des
chevaliers
de
du
relates
the
incident
in
the
following
manner
after
the
death
of
jacques
du
molay
some
scottish
templars
having
become
apostates
at
the
instigation
of
robert
bruce
ranged
themselves
under
the
banners
of
a
new
order
instituted
by
this
prince
and
in
which
the
receptions
were
based
on
those
of
the
order
of
the
temple
it
is
there
that
we
must
seek
the
origin
of
scottish
masonry
and
even
that
of
the
other
masonic
rites
the
scottish
templars
were
excommunicated
in
by
larmenius
who
declared
them
to
be
and
the
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
militiæ
placed
for
ever
outside
the
pale
of
the
temple
girum
templi
nunc
et
in
futurum
volo
dico
et
a
similar
anathema
has
since
been
launched
by
several
grand
masters
against
templars
who
were
rebellious
to
legitimate
authority
from
the
schism
that
was
introduced
into
scotland
a
number
of
sects
took
birth
this
account
forms
a
complete
exoneration
of
the
scottish
templars
as
apostates
from
the
bogus
christian
church
and
the
doctrines
of
johannism
they
showed
themselves
loyal
to
the
true
church
and
to
the
christian
faith
as
formulated
in
the
published
statutes
of
their
order
what
they
appear
then
to
have
introduced
to
masonry
was
their
manner
of
reception
that
is
to
say
their
outer
forms
and
organization
and
possibly
certain
eastern
esoteric
doctrines
and
judaic
legends
concerning
the
building
of
the
temple
of
solomon
in
no
way
incompatible
with
the
teaching
of
christianity
it
will
be
noticed
moreover
that
in
the
ban
passed
by
the
du
on
the
scottish
templars
the
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
are
also
included
this
is
a
further
tribute
to
the
orthodoxy
of
the
scottish
knights
for
to
the
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
to
whom
the
templar
property
was
given
no
suspicion
of
heresy
had
ever
attached
after
the
suppression
of
the
order
of
the
temple
in
a
number
of
the
knights
joined
themselves
to
the
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
by
whom
the
templar
system
appears
to
have
been
purged
of
its
heretical
elements
as
we
shall
see
later
the
same
process
is
said
to
have
been
carried
out
by
the
royal
order
of
scotland
all
this
suggests
that
the
templars
had
imported
a
secret
doctrine
from
the
east
which
was
capable
either
of
a
christian
or
an
interpretation
that
through
their
connexion
with
the
royal
order
of
scotland
and
the
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
this
christian
interpretation
was
preserved
and
finally
that
it
was
this
pure
doctrine
which
passed
into
freemasonry
according
to
early
masonic
authorities
the
adoption
of
the
two
johns
as
the
patron
saints
of
masonry
arose
not
from
johannism
but
from
the
alliance
between
the
templars
and
the
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
theory
of
the
templar
connexion
with
freemasonry
was
held
by
the
continental
freemasons
of
the
eighteenth
century
who
living
at
the
time
the
order
was
reconstituted
on
its
present
basis
were
clearly
in
a
better
position
to
know
its
origins
than
we
who
are
separated
from
that
date
by
a
distance
of
two
hundred
years
but
since
their
testimony
first
comes
to
light
at
the
period
of
the
upper
degrees
in
which
the
templar
influence
is
more
clearly
visible
than
in
craft
masonry
it
must
be
reserved
for
a
later
chapter
before
passing
on
to
this
further
stage
in
the
history
of
the
craft
it
is
necessary
to
consider
one
more
link
in
the
chain
of
the
masonic
tradition
the
holy
vehm
the
vehmgerichts
these
dread
tribunals
said
to
have
been
established
by
charlemagne
in
in
westphalia
had
for
their
avowed
object
the
establishment
of
law
and
order
amidst
the
unsettled
and
even
anarchic
conditions
that
then
reigned
in
germany
but
by
degrees
the
power
arrogated
to
itself
by
the
holy
vehm
became
so
formidable
that
succeeding
emperors
were
unable
to
control
its
workings
and
found
themselves
forced
to
become
initiates
from
motives
of
during
the
twelfth
century
the
vehmgerichts
by
their
continual
executions
had
created
a
veritable
red
terror
so
that
the
east
of
germany
was
known
as
the
red
land
in
says
lecouteulx
de
canteleu
a
fresh
impetus
was
given
to
the
holy
vehm
by
a
number
of
the
knights
templar
who
on
the
dissolution
of
their
order
had
found
their
way
to
germany
and
now
sought
admission
to
the
secret
tribunals
how
much
of
templar
lore
passed
into
the
hand
of
the
vehmgerichts
it
is
impossible
to
know
but
there
is
certainly
a
resemblance
between
the
methods
of
initiation
and
intimidation
employed
by
the
vehms
and
those
described
by
certain
of
the
templars
still
more
between
the
ceremony
of
the
vehms
and
the
ritual
of
freemasonry
thus
the
members
of
the
vehms
known
as
the
or
enlightened
were
divided
into
three
degrees
of
initiation
the
free
judges
the
veritable
free
judges
and
the
holy
judges
of
the
secret
tribunal
the
candidate
for
initiation
was
led
blindfold
before
the
dread
tribunal
presided
over
by
a
or
master
of
the
chair
or
his
substitute
a
with
a
sword
and
branch
of
willow
at
his
side
the
initiate
was
then
bound
by
a
terrible
oath
not
to
reveal
the
secrets
of
the
holy
vehm
to
warn
no
one
of
danger
threatening
them
by
its
decrees
to
denounce
anyone
whether
father
mother
brother
sister
friend
or
relation
if
such
a
one
had
been
condemned
by
the
tribunal
after
this
he
was
given
the
password
and
grip
by
which
the
confederates
recognized
each
other
in
the
event
of
his
turning
traitor
or
revealing
the
secrets
confided
to
him
his
eyes
were
bandaged
his
hands
tied
behind
his
back
and
his
tongue
was
torn
out
through
the
back
of
his
neck
after
which
he
was
hanged
by
the
feet
till
he
was
dead
with
the
solemn
imprecation
that
his
body
should
be
given
as
a
prey
to
the
birds
of
the
air
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
the
points
of
resemblance
with
modern
masonic
ritual
which
may
here
be
discerned
can
be
a
mere
matter
of
coincidence
yet
it
would
be
equally
unreasonable
to
trace
the
origins
of
freemasonry
to
the
vehmgerichts
clearly
both
derived
from
a
common
source
either
the
old
pagan
traditions
on
which
the
early
vehms
were
founded
or
the
system
of
the
templars
the
latter
seems
the
more
probable
for
two
reasons
firstly
on
account
of
the
resemblance
between
the
methods
of
the
vehmgerichts
and
the
assassins
which
would
be
explained
if
the
templars
formed
the
connecting
link
and
secondly
the
fact
that
in
contemporary
documents
the
members
of
the
secret
tribunals
were
frequently
referred
to
under
the
name
of
now
since
as
we
have
seen
the
degree
of
the
rosy
cross
is
said
to
have
been
brought
to
europe
by
the
templars
this
would
account
for
the
persistence
of
the
name
in
the
vehmgerichts
as
well
as
in
the
rosicrucians
of
the
seventeenth
century
who
are
said
to
have
continued
the
templar
tradition
thus
templarism
and
rosicrucianism
appear
to
have
been
always
closely
connected
a
fact
which
is
not
surprising
since
both
derive
from
a
common
source
the
traditions
of
the
near
east
this
brings
us
to
an
alternative
theory
concerning
the
channel
through
which
eastern
doctrines
and
particularly
cabalism
found
their
way
into
freemasonry
for
it
must
be
admitted
that
one
obstacle
to
the
complete
acceptance
of
the
theory
of
the
templar
succession
exists
namely
that
although
the
judaic
element
can
not
be
traced
further
back
than
the
crusades
neither
can
it
with
certainty
be
pronounced
to
have
come
into
existence
during
the
three
centuries
that
followed
after
indeed
before
the
publication
of
anderson
constitutions
in
there
is
no
definite
evidence
that
the
solomonic
legend
had
been
incorporated
into
the
ritual
of
british
masonry
so
although
the
possession
of
the
legend
by
the
of
the
middle
ages
would
tend
to
prove
its
antiquity
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
it
was
introduced
by
some
later
body
of
adepts
than
the
templars
according
to
the
partisans
of
a
further
theory
these
adepts
were
the
rosicrucians
rosicrucian
origin
one
of
the
earliest
and
most
eminent
precursors
of
freemasonry
is
said
to
have
been
francis
bacon
as
we
have
already
seen
bacon
is
recognized
to
have
been
a
rosicrucian
and
that
the
secret
philosophical
doctrine
he
professed
was
closely
akin
to
freemasonry
is
clearly
apparent
in
his
the
reference
to
the
wise
men
of
the
society
of
solomon
house
can
not
be
a
mere
coincidence
the
choice
of
atlantis
the
legendary
island
supposed
to
have
been
submerged
by
the
atlantic
ocean
in
the
remote
past
would
suggest
that
bacon
had
some
knowledge
of
a
secret
tradition
descending
from
the
earliest
patriarchs
of
the
human
race
whom
like
the
modern
writer
le
plongeon
he
imagined
to
have
inhabited
the
western
hemisphere
and
to
have
been
the
predecessors
of
the
egyptian
initiates
le
plongeon
however
places
this
early
seat
of
the
mysteries
still
further
west
than
the
atlantic
ocean
in
the
region
of
mayax
and
yucatan
bacon
further
relates
that
this
tradition
was
preserved
in
its
pure
form
by
certain
of
the
jews
who
whilst
accepting
the
cabala
rejected
its
tendencies
thus
in
this
island
of
bensalem
there
are
jews
of
a
far
differing
disposition
from
the
jews
in
other
parts
for
whereas
they
hate
the
name
of
christ
and
have
a
secret
inbred
rancour
against
the
people
amongst
whom
they
live
these
contrariwise
give
unto
our
saviour
many
high
attributes
but
at
the
same
time
they
believe
that
moses
by
a
secret
cabala
ordained
the
laws
of
bensalem
which
they
now
use
and
that
when
the
messiah
should
come
and
sit
on
his
throne
at
jerusalem
the
king
of
bensalem
should
sit
at
his
feet
whereas
other
kings
should
keep
at
a
great
distance
this
passage
is
of
particular
interest
as
showing
that
bacon
recognized
the
divergence
between
the
ancient
secret
tradition
descending
from
moses
and
the
perverted
jewish
cabala
of
the
rabbis
and
that
he
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
tendency
even
among
the
best
of
jews
to
turn
the
former
to
the
advantage
of
the
messianic
dreams
pott
who
in
her
bacon
and
his
secret
sets
out
to
prove
that
bacon
was
the
founder
of
rosicrucianism
and
freemasonry
ignores
all
the
previous
history
of
the
secret
tradition
bacon
was
not
the
originator
but
the
inheritor
of
the
ideas
on
which
both
these
societies
were
founded
and
the
further
contention
that
bacon
was
at
the
same
time
the
author
of
the
greatest
dramas
in
the
english
language
and
of
chymical
marriage
of
christian
is
manifestly
absurd
nevertheless
bacon
influence
amongst
the
rosicrucians
is
apparent
heydon
to
the
land
of
the
is
in
fact
a
mere
plagiarism
of
bacon
pott
seems
to
imagine
that
by
proclaiming
bacon
to
have
been
the
founder
or
even
a
member
of
the
order
of
freemasonry
she
is
revealing
a
great
masonic
secret
which
freemasons
have
conspired
to
keep
dark
but
why
should
the
craft
desire
to
disown
so
illustrious
a
progenitor
or
seek
to
conceal
his
connexion
with
the
order
if
any
such
existed
findel
indeed
frankly
admits
that
the
contained
unmistakable
allusions
to
freemasonry
and
that
bacon
contributed
to
its
final
transformation
this
was
doubtless
brought
about
largely
by
the
english
rosicrucians
who
followed
after
to
suggest
then
that
freemasonry
originated
with
the
rosicrucians
is
to
ignore
the
previous
history
of
the
secret
tradition
rosicrucianism
was
not
the
beginning
but
a
link
in
the
long
chain
connecting
freemasonry
with
far
earlier
secret
associations
the
resemblance
between
the
two
orders
admits
of
no
denial
thus
yarker
writes
the
symbolic
tracing
of
the
rosicrucians
was
a
square
temple
approached
by
seven
steps
here
also
we
find
the
two
pillars
of
hermes
the
star
sun
and
moon
compasses
square
and
triangle
yarker
further
observes
that
even
wren
was
more
or
less
a
student
of
hermeticism
and
if
we
had
a
full
list
of
freemasons
and
rosicrucians
we
should
probably
be
surprised
at
the
numbers
who
belonged
to
both
systems
professor
bühle
emphatically
states
that
freemasonry
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
rosicrucianism
as
modified
by
those
who
transplanted
it
into
england
chambers
who
published
his
famous
in
observes
some
who
are
no
friends
to
freemasonry
make
the
present
flourishing
society
of
freemasons
a
branch
of
or
rather
the
rosicrucians
themselves
under
a
new
name
or
relation
viz
as
retainers
to
building
and
it
is
certain
there
are
some
freemasons
who
have
all
the
characters
of
rosicrucians
the
connexion
between
freemasonry
and
rosicrucianism
is
however
a
question
hardly
less
controversial
than
that
of
the
connexion
between
freemasonry
and
templarism
mackey
violently
disputes
the
theory
the
rosicrucians
he
writes
as
this
brief
history
indicates
had
no
connexion
whatever
with
the
masonic
fraternity
notwithstanding
this
fact
barruel
the
most
malignant
of
our
revilers
with
a
characteristic
spirit
of
misrepresentation
attempted
to
identify
the
two
institutions
but
the
aforesaid
brief
history
indicates
nothing
of
the
kind
and
the
reference
to
barruel
as
a
malignant
reviler
for
suggesting
a
connexion
which
as
we
have
seen
many
freemasons
admit
shows
on
which
side
this
spirit
of
misrepresentation
exists
it
is
interesting
however
to
note
that
in
the
eyes
of
certain
masonic
writers
connexion
with
the
rosicrucians
is
regarded
as
highly
discreditable
the
fraternity
would
thus
appear
to
have
been
less
blameless
than
we
have
been
taught
to
believe
waite
is
equally
concerned
with
proving
that
there
is
no
traceable
connexion
between
masonry
and
rosicrucianism
and
he
goes
on
to
explain
that
freemasonry
was
never
a
learned
society
that
it
never
laid
claim
to
any
transcendental
secrets
of
alchemy
and
magic
or
to
any
skill
in
medicine
etc
the
truth
may
lie
between
the
opposing
contentions
of
bühle
and
his
two
masonic
antagonists
the
freemasons
were
clearly
for
the
reasons
given
by
waite
not
a
mere
continuation
of
the
rosicrucians
but
more
likely
borrowed
from
the
rosicrucians
a
part
of
their
system
and
symbols
which
they
adapted
to
their
own
purpose
moreover
the
incontrovertible
fact
is
that
in
the
list
of
english
freemasons
and
rosicrucians
we
find
men
who
belonged
to
both
orders
and
amongst
these
two
who
contributed
largely
to
the
constitutions
of
english
freemasonry
the
first
of
these
is
robert
fludd
whom
waite
describes
as
the
central
figure
of
rosicrucian
literature
an
intellectual
giant
a
man
of
immense
erudition
of
exalted
mind
and
to
judge
by
his
writings
of
extreme
personal
sanctity
ennemoser
describes
him
as
one
of
the
most
distinguished
disciples
of
paracelsus
yarker
adds
this
clue
in
we
find
fludd
the
chief
of
the
rosicrucians
using
architectural
language
and
there
is
proof
that
his
society
was
divided
into
degrees
and
from
the
fact
that
the
masons
company
of
london
had
a
copy
of
the
masonic
charges
by
fflood
we
may
suppose
that
he
was
a
freemason
before
a
still
more
important
link
is
elias
ashmole
the
antiquary
astrologer
and
alchemist
founder
of
the
ashmolean
museum
at
oxford
who
was
born
in
an
avowed
rosicrucian
and
as
we
have
seen
also
a
freemason
ashmole
displayed
great
energy
in
reconstituting
the
craft
he
is
said
to
have
perfected
its
organization
to
have
added
to
it
further
mystic
symbols
and
according
to
ragon
it
was
he
who
drew
up
the
ritual
of
the
existing
three
craft
degrees
entered
apprentice
and
master
mason
which
was
adopted
by
grand
lodge
in
whence
did
these
fresh
inspirations
come
but
from
the
rosicrucians
for
as
ragon
also
informs
us
in
the
year
that
ashmole
was
received
into
freemasonry
the
rosicrucians
held
their
meeting
in
the
same
room
at
mason
hall
how
then
can
it
be
said
that
there
was
no
traceable
connexion
between
freemasonry
and
rosicrucianism
and
why
should
it
be
the
part
of
a
malignant
reviler
to
connect
them
it
is
not
suggested
that
rosicrucians
such
as
fludd
or
ashmole
imported
any
magical
elements
into
freemasonry
but
simply
the
system
and
symbols
of
the
with
a
certain
degree
of
esoteric
learning
that
rosicrucianism
forms
an
important
link
in
the
chain
of
the
secret
tradition
is
therefore
undeniable
the
rabbis
there
is
however
a
third
channel
through
which
the
judaic
legends
of
freemasonry
may
have
penetrated
to
the
craft
namely
the
rabbis
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
jewish
writer
bernard
lazare
has
declared
that
there
were
jews
around
the
cradle
of
freemasonry
and
if
this
statement
is
applied
to
the
period
preceding
the
institution
of
grand
lodge
in
it
certainly
finds
confirmation
in
fact
thus
it
is
said
that
in
the
preceding
century
the
now
used
by
grand
lodge
had
been
designed
by
an
amsterdam
jew
jacob
jehuda
leon
templo
colleague
of
cromwell
friend
the
cabalist
manasseh
ben
israel
to
quote
jewish
authority
on
this
question
lucien
wolf
writes
that
templo
had
a
monomania
for
everything
relating
to
the
temple
of
solomon
and
the
tabernacle
of
the
wilderness
he
constructed
gigantic
models
of
both
these
edifices
these
he
exhibited
in
london
which
he
visited
in
and
earlier
and
it
seems
not
unreasonable
to
conclude
that
this
may
have
provided
a
fresh
source
of
inspiration
to
the
freemasons
who
framed
the
masonic
ritual
some
forty
years
later
at
any
rate
the
masonic
still
used
by
grand
lodge
of
england
is
undoubtedly
of
jewish
design
this
coat
says
lucien
wolf
is
entirely
composed
of
jewish
symbols
and
is
an
attempt
to
display
heraldically
the
various
forms
of
the
cherubim
pictured
to
us
in
the
second
vision
of
ezekiel
an
ox
a
man
a
lion
and
an
eagle
and
thus
belongs
to
the
highest
and
most
mystical
domain
of
hebrew
symbolism
in
other
words
this
vision
known
to
the
jews
as
the
mercaba
belongs
to
the
cabala
where
a
particular
interpretation
is
placed
on
each
figure
so
as
to
provide
an
esoteric
meaning
not
perceptible
to
the
uninitiated
the
masonic
is
thus
entirely
cabalistic
as
is
also
the
seal
on
the
diplomas
of
craft
masonry
where
another
cabalistic
figure
that
of
a
man
and
woman
combined
is
reproduced
of
the
jewish
influence
in
masonry
after
i
shall
speak
later
to
sum
up
then
the
origins
of
the
system
we
now
know
as
freemasonry
are
not
to
be
found
in
one
source
alone
the
twelve
alternative
sources
enumerated
in
the
and
quoted
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
may
all
have
contributed
to
its
formation
thus
operative
masonry
may
have
descended
from
the
roman
collegia
and
through
the
operative
masons
of
the
middle
ages
whilst
speculative
masonry
may
have
derived
from
the
patriarchs
and
the
mysteries
of
the
pagans
but
the
source
of
inspiration
which
admits
of
no
denial
is
the
jewish
cabala
whether
this
penetrated
to
our
country
through
the
roman
collegia
the
the
templars
the
rosicrucians
or
through
the
jews
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
whose
activities
behind
the
scenes
of
freemasonry
we
shall
see
later
is
a
matter
of
speculation
the
fact
remains
that
when
the
ritual
and
constitutions
of
masonry
were
drawn
up
in
although
certain
fragments
of
the
ancient
egyptian
and
pythagorean
doctrines
were
retained
the
judaic
version
of
the
secret
tradition
was
the
one
selected
by
the
founders
of
grand
lodge
on
which
to
build
up
their
system
the
grand
lodge
era
whatever
were
the
origins
of
the
order
we
now
know
as
freemasonry
it
is
clear
that
during
the
century
preceding
its
reorganization
under
grand
lodge
of
london
the
secret
system
of
binding
men
together
for
a
common
purpose
based
on
eastern
esoteric
doctrines
had
been
anticipated
by
the
rosicrucians
was
this
secret
system
employed
however
by
any
other
body
of
men
it
is
certainly
easy
to
imagine
how
in
this
momentous
seventeenth
century
when
men
of
all
opinions
were
coalescing
against
opposing
forces
lutherans
combining
against
the
papacy
catholics
rallying
their
forces
against
invading
protestantism
republicans
plotting
in
favour
of
cromwell
royalists
in
their
turn
plotting
to
restore
the
stuarts
finally
royalists
plotting
against
each
other
on
behalf
of
rival
dynasties
an
organization
of
this
kind
enabling
one
to
work
secretly
for
a
cause
and
to
set
invisibly
vast
numbers
of
human
beings
in
motion
might
prove
invaluable
to
any
party
thus
according
to
certain
masonic
writers
on
the
continent
the
system
used
by
the
rosicrucians
in
their
fight
against
popery
was
also
employed
by
the
jesuits
for
a
directly
opposite
purpose
in
the
manuscripts
of
the
prince
of
hesse
published
by
lecouteulx
de
canteleu
it
is
declared
that
in
the
jesuits
used
the
mysteries
of
the
mirabeau
also
relates
that
the
jesuits
profited
by
the
internal
troubles
of
the
reign
of
charles
i
to
possess
themselves
of
the
symbols
the
allegories
and
the
carpets
tapis
of
the
masons
who
were
only
the
ancient
order
of
the
templars
secretly
perpetuated
it
may
be
seen
by
means
of
what
imperceptible
innovations
they
succeeded
in
substituting
their
catechism
to
the
instruction
of
the
templars
other
continental
writers
again
assert
that
cromwell
the
of
the
catholic
church
was
a
higher
initiate
of
masonic
mysteries
and
used
the
system
for
his
own
elevation
to
power
further
that
he
found
himself
outdistanced
by
the
levellers
that
this
sect
whose
name
certainly
suggests
masonic
inspiration
adopted
for
its
symbols
the
square
and
compass
and
in
its
claim
of
real
equality
threatened
the
supremacy
of
the
usurper
finally
elias
ashmole
the
rosicrucian
royalist
is
said
to
have
turned
the
masonic
system
against
cromwell
so
that
towards
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
order
rallied
to
the
stuart
cause
but
all
this
is
pure
speculation
resting
on
no
basis
of
known
facts
the
accusation
that
the
jesuits
used
the
system
of
the
as
a
cover
to
political
intrigues
is
referred
to
by
the
rosicrucian
eliphas
lévi
as
the
outcome
of
ignorance
which
refutes
itself
it
is
significant
to
notice
that
it
emanates
mainly
from
germany
and
from
the
illuminati
the
prince
of
hesse
was
a
member
of
the
and
mirabeau
an
illuminatus
at
the
time
he
wrote
the
passage
quoted
above
that
in
the
seventeenth
century
certain
jesuits
played
the
part
of
political
intriguers
i
suppose
their
warmest
friends
will
hardly
deny
but
that
they
employed
any
secret
or
masonic
system
seems
to
me
perfectly
incapable
of
proof
i
shall
return
to
this
point
later
however
in
connexion
with
the
illuminati
as
to
cromwell
the
only
circumstance
that
lends
any
colour
to
the
possibility
of
his
connexion
with
freemasonry
is
his
known
friendship
for
manasseh
ben
israel
the
colleague
of
the
rabbi
templo
who
designed
the
later
adopted
by
grand
lodge
if
therefore
the
jews
of
amsterdam
were
a
source
of
inspiration
to
the
freemasons
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
is
not
impossible
that
cromwell
may
have
been
the
channel
through
which
this
influence
first
penetrated
in
the
matter
of
the
stuarts
we
are
however
on
firm
ground
with
regard
to
freemasonry
that
the
lodges
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
were
royalist
is
certain
and
there
seems
good
reason
to
believe
that
when
the
revolution
of
divided
the
royalist
cause
the
jacobites
who
fled
to
france
with
james
ii
took
freemasonry
with
them
with
the
help
of
the
french
they
established
lodges
in
which
it
is
said
masonic
rites
and
symbols
were
used
to
promote
the
cause
of
the
stuarts
thus
the
land
of
promise
signified
great
britain
jerusalem
stood
for
london
and
the
murder
of
hiram
represented
the
execution
of
charles
i
meanwhile
freemasonry
in
england
did
not
continue
to
adhere
to
the
stuart
cause
as
it
had
done
under
the
ægis
of
elias
ashmole
and
by
is
said
to
have
become
hanoverian
from
this
important
date
the
official
history
of
the
present
system
may
be
said
to
begin
hitherto
everything
rests
on
stray
documents
of
which
the
authenticity
is
frequently
doubtful
and
which
provide
no
continuous
history
of
the
order
in
for
the
first
time
freemasonry
was
established
on
a
settled
basis
and
in
the
process
underwent
a
fundamental
change
so
far
it
would
seem
to
have
retained
an
operative
element
but
in
the
transformation
that
now
took
place
this
was
entirely
eliminated
and
the
whole
order
was
transformed
into
a
speculative
body
this
already
suggested
in
took
place
in
when
four
london
lodges
of
freemasons
met
together
at
the
apple
tree
tavern
in
charles
street
covent
garden
and
having
put
into
the
chair
the
oldest
master
mason
now
the
master
of
a
lodge
they
constituted
themselves
a
grand
lodge
in
due
form
on
john
the
baptist
day
june
of
the
next
year
the
annual
assembly
and
banquet
were
held
at
the
goose
and
gridiron
in
paul
churchyard
when
antony
sayer
was
elected
grand
master
and
invested
with
all
the
badges
of
office
it
is
evident
from
the
above
account
that
already
in
the
speculative
elements
must
have
predominated
in
the
lodges
otherwise
we
might
expect
to
find
the
operative
masons
taking
some
part
in
these
proceedings
and
expressing
their
opinion
as
to
whether
their
association
should
pass
under
the
control
of
men
entirely
unconnected
with
the
craft
but
no
the
leaders
of
the
new
movement
all
appear
to
have
belonged
to
the
middle
class
nor
from
this
moment
do
either
masons
or
architects
seem
to
have
played
any
prominent
part
in
freemasonry
but
the
point
that
official
history
does
not
attempt
to
elucidate
is
the
reason
for
this
decision
why
should
the
freemasons
of
london
whether
they
were
at
this
date
a
speculative
or
only
a
association
have
suddenly
recognized
the
necessity
of
establishing
a
grand
lodge
and
drawing
up
a
ritual
and
constitution
it
is
evident
then
that
some
circumstances
must
have
arisen
which
led
them
to
take
this
important
step
i
would
suggest
that
the
following
may
be
the
solution
to
the
problem
freemasonry
as
we
have
seen
was
a
system
that
could
be
employed
in
any
cause
and
had
now
come
to
be
used
by
intriguers
of
every
kind
and
not
only
by
intriguers
but
by
merely
convivial
bodies
jolly
brotherhoods
of
the
bottle
who
modelled
themselves
on
masonic
associations
but
the
honest
citizens
of
london
who
met
and
feasted
at
the
goose
and
gridiron
were
clearly
not
intriguers
they
were
neither
royalist
nor
republican
plotters
neither
catholic
nor
lutheran
fanatics
neither
alchemists
nor
magicians
nor
can
it
be
supposed
that
they
were
simply
revellers
if
they
were
political
they
were
certainly
not
supporters
of
the
stuarts
on
the
contrary
they
were
generally
reported
to
have
been
hanoverian
in
their
sympathies
indeed
bussell
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
grand
lodge
was
instituted
to
support
the
hanoverian
dynasty
it
would
be
perhaps
nearer
the
truth
to
conclude
that
if
they
were
hanoverian
it
was
because
they
were
constitutional
and
the
hanoverian
dynasty
having
now
been
established
they
wished
to
avoid
further
changes
in
a
word
then
they
were
simply
men
of
peace
anxious
to
put
an
end
to
dissensions
who
seeing
the
system
of
masonry
utilized
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
discord
determined
to
wrest
it
from
the
hands
of
political
intriguers
and
restore
it
to
its
original
character
of
brotherhood
though
not
of
brotherhood
between
working
masons
only
but
between
men
drawn
from
all
classes
and
professions
by
founding
a
grand
lodge
in
london
and
drawing
up
a
ritual
and
constitutions
they
hoped
to
prevent
the
perversion
of
their
signs
and
symbols
and
to
establish
the
order
on
a
settled
basis
according
to
nicolai
this
pacific
purpose
had
already
animated
english
freemasons
under
the
grand
mastership
of
sir
christopher
wren
its
principal
object
from
this
period
was
to
moderate
the
religious
hatreds
so
terrible
in
england
during
the
reign
of
james
ii
and
to
try
and
establish
some
kind
of
concord
or
fraternity
by
weakening
as
far
as
possible
the
antagonisms
arising
from
the
differences
of
religions
ranks
and
interests
an
manuscript
of
the
prince
of
hesse
quoted
by
lecouteulx
de
canteleu
expresses
the
view
that
in
mysteries
of
freemasonry
were
reformed
and
purified
in
england
of
all
political
in
the
matter
of
religion
craft
masonry
adopted
an
equally
attitude
the
first
constitutions
of
the
order
drawn
up
by
anderson
in
contain
the
following
paragraph
concerning
god
and
religion
a
mason
is
obliged
by
his
tenure
to
obey
the
moral
law
and
if
he
rightly
understands
the
art
he
will
never
be
a
stupid
atheist
nor
an
irreligious
libertine
but
though
in
ancient
times
masons
were
charged
in
every
country
to
be
of
the
religion
of
that
country
or
nation
whatever
it
was
yet
is
now
thought
more
expedient
only
to
oblige
them
to
that
religion
in
which
all
men
agree
leaving
their
particular
opinions
to
themselves
that
is
to
be
good
men
and
true
or
men
of
honour
and
honesty
by
whatever
denominations
or
persuasions
they
may
be
distinguish
whereby
masonry
becomes
the
centre
of
union
and
the
means
of
conciliating
true
friendship
among
persons
that
must
have
remained
at
a
perpetual
distance
the
phrase
that
religion
in
which
all
men
agree
has
been
censured
by
catholic
writers
as
advocating
a
universal
religion
in
the
place
of
christianity
but
this
by
no
means
follows
the
idea
is
surely
that
masons
should
be
men
adhering
to
that
law
of
right
and
wrong
common
to
all
religious
faiths
craft
masonry
may
thus
be
described
as
deist
in
character
but
not
in
the
accepted
sense
of
the
word
which
implies
the
rejection
of
christian
doctrines
if
freemasonry
had
been
deist
in
this
sense
might
we
not
expect
to
find
some
connexion
between
the
founders
of
grand
lodge
and
the
school
of
deists
toland
bolingbroke
woolston
hume
and
others
which
flourished
precisely
at
this
period
might
not
some
analogy
be
detected
between
the
organization
of
the
order
and
the
sodalities
described
in
toland
published
in
but
of
this
i
can
find
no
trace
whatever
the
principal
founders
of
grand
lodge
were
as
we
have
seen
clergymen
both
engaged
in
preaching
christian
doctrines
at
their
respective
churches
it
is
surely
therefore
reasonable
to
conclude
that
freemasonry
at
the
time
of
its
reorganization
in
was
deistic
only
in
so
far
that
it
invited
men
to
meet
together
on
the
common
ground
of
a
belief
in
god
moreover
some
of
the
early
english
rituals
contain
distinctly
christian
elements
thus
both
in
and
and
or
the
grand
master
key
to
the
door
of
both
antient
and
modern
freemasonry
by
a
member
of
the
royal
we
find
prayers
in
the
lodges
concluding
with
the
name
of
christ
these
passages
were
replaced
much
later
by
purely
deistic
formulas
under
the
grand
mastership
of
the
duke
of
sussex
in
but
in
spite
of
its
innocuous
character
freemasonry
merely
by
reason
of
its
secrecy
soon
began
to
excite
alarm
in
the
public
mind
as
early
as
a
work
entitled
grand
mystery
of
the
freemasons
had
provoked
an
angry
remonstrance
from
the
craft
and
when
the
french
edict
against
the
order
was
passed
a
letter
signed
jachin
appeared
in
gentleman
declaring
the
freemasons
who
have
lately
been
suppressed
not
only
in
france
but
in
holland
to
be
a
dangerous
race
of
men
no
government
ought
to
suffer
such
clandestine
assemblies
where
plots
against
the
state
may
be
carried
on
under
the
pretence
of
brotherly
love
and
good
fellowship
the
writer
evidently
unaware
of
possible
templar
traditions
goes
on
to
observe
that
the
sentinel
placed
at
the
door
of
the
lodge
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
is
not
the
only
mark
of
their
being
a
military
order
and
suggests
that
the
title
of
grand
master
is
taken
in
imitation
of
the
knights
of
malta
jachin
moreover
scents
a
popish
plot
they
not
only
admit
turks
jews
infidels
but
even
jacobites
and
papists
themselves
how
can
we
be
sure
that
those
persons
who
are
known
to
be
well
affected
are
let
into
all
their
mysteries
they
make
no
scruple
to
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
prentices
and
master
masons
and
who
knows
whether
they
may
not
have
an
higher
order
of
cabalists
who
keep
the
grand
secret
of
all
entirely
to
themselves
later
on
in
france
the
abbé
pérau
published
his
satires
on
freemasonry
secret
des
des
trahi
et
le
secret
des
mopses
and
and
in
about
another
english
writer
said
to
be
a
mason
brought
down
a
torrent
of
invective
on
his
head
by
the
publication
of
the
ritual
of
the
craft
degrees
under
the
name
of
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
from
all
this
controversy
no
party
emerges
in
a
very
charitable
light
catholics
and
protestants
alike
indulging
in
sarcasms
and
reckless
accusations
against
freemasonry
the
freemasons
retorting
with
far
from
brotherly
forbearance
but
again
one
must
remember
that
all
these
men
were
of
their
age
an
age
which
seen
through
the
eyes
of
hogarth
would
certainly
not
appear
to
have
been
distinguished
for
delicacy
it
should
be
noted
however
when
one
reads
in
masonic
works
of
the
persecutions
to
which
freemasonry
has
been
subjected
that
aggression
was
not
confined
only
to
the
one
side
in
the
conflict
moreover
that
the
freemasons
at
this
period
were
divided
amongst
themselves
and
expressed
with
regard
to
opposing
groups
much
the
same
suspicions
that
expressed
with
regard
to
the
order
as
a
whole
for
the
years
following
after
the
suppression
of
masonry
in
france
were
marked
by
the
most
important
development
in
the
history
of
the
modern
order
the
inauguration
of
the
additional
degrees
the
additional
degrees
the
origin
and
inspiration
of
the
additional
degrees
has
provoked
hardly
less
controversy
in
masonic
circles
than
the
origin
of
masonry
itself
it
should
be
explained
that
craft
masonry
or
blue
masonry
that
is
to
say
the
first
three
degrees
of
entered
apprentice
fellow
craft
and
master
mason
of
which
i
have
attempted
to
trace
the
history
were
the
only
degrees
recognized
by
grand
lodge
at
the
time
of
its
foundation
in
and
still
form
the
basis
of
all
forms
of
modern
masonry
on
this
foundation
were
erected
somewhere
between
and
the
degree
of
the
royal
arch
and
the
first
of
the
series
of
upper
degrees
now
known
as
the
scottish
rite
or
as
the
ancient
and
accepted
rite
the
acceptance
or
rejection
of
this
superstructure
has
always
formed
a
subject
of
violent
controversy
between
masons
one
body
affirming
that
craft
masonry
is
the
only
true
and
genuine
masonry
the
other
declaring
that
the
real
object
of
masonry
is
only
to
be
found
in
the
higher
degrees
it
was
this
controversy
centring
round
the
royal
arch
degree
that
about
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
split
masonry
into
opposing
camps
of
ancients
and
moderns
the
ancients
declaring
that
the
was
the
root
heart
and
marrow
of
freemasonry
the
moderns
rejecting
it
although
worked
by
the
ancients
from
onwards
this
degree
was
definitely
repudiated
by
grand
lodge
in
and
only
in
was
officially
received
into
english
freemasonry
the
degree
which
is
said
nevertheless
to
be
contained
in
embryo
in
the
book
of
constitutions
is
purely
judaic
a
glorification
of
israel
and
commemorating
the
building
of
the
second
temple
that
it
was
derived
from
the
jewish
cabala
seems
probable
and
yarker
commenting
on
the
phrase
in
the
quoted
above
who
knows
whether
they
the
freemasons
have
not
a
higher
order
of
cabalists
who
keep
the
grand
secret
of
all
entirely
to
themselves
observes
it
looks
very
like
an
intimation
of
the
royal
arch
degree
and
elsewhere
he
states
that
the
royal
arch
degree
when
it
had
the
three
veils
must
have
been
the
work
even
if
by
instruction
of
a
cabalistic
jew
about
and
from
this
time
we
may
expect
to
find
a
secret
tradition
grafted
upon
anderson
system
precisely
in
this
same
year
of
waite
says
that
an
itinerant
pedlar
of
the
royal
arch
degree
is
said
to
have
propagated
it
in
ireland
claiming
that
it
was
practised
at
york
and
london
and
in
a
certain
dassigny
wrote
that
the
minds
of
the
dublin
brethren
had
been
lately
disturbed
about
royal
arch
masonry
owing
to
the
activities
in
dublin
of
a
number
of
traders
or
hucksters
in
pretended
masonry
whom
the
writer
connects
with
italians
or
the
italic
order
a
freemason
quoting
this
passage
in
a
recent
discussion
on
the
upper
degrees
expresses
the
opinion
that
these
hucksters
were
jacobite
emissaries
disguised
under
the
form
of
a
pretended
masonry
and
that
by
italians
and
italian
order
he
intends
a
reference
to
the
court
of
king
james
iii
the
old
pretender
at
rome
and
to
the
ecossais
italic
order
of
masonry
it
is
much
more
likely
that
he
had
referred
to
another
source
of
masonic
instruction
in
italy
which
i
shall
indicate
in
a
later
chapter
but
precisely
at
the
moment
when
it
is
suggested
that
the
jacobites
were
intriguing
to
introduce
the
royal
arch
degree
into
masonry
they
are
also
said
to
have
been
engaged
in
elaborating
the
scottish
rite
let
us
examine
this
contention
freemasonry
in
france
the
foundation
of
grand
lodge
in
london
had
been
followed
by
the
inauguration
of
masonic
lodges
on
the
continent
in
at
mons
in
in
paris
in
at
madrid
in
at
the
hague
in
at
hamburg
etc
several
of
these
received
their
warrant
from
the
grand
lodge
of
england
but
this
was
not
the
case
with
the
grand
lodge
of
paris
which
did
not
receive
a
warrant
till
the
men
who
founded
this
lodge
far
from
being
were
jacobite
leaders
engaged
in
active
schemes
for
the
restoration
of
the
stuart
dynasty
the
leader
of
the
group
charles
radcliffe
had
been
imprisoned
with
his
brother
the
lord
derwentwater
who
was
executed
on
tower
hill
in
charles
had
succeeded
in
escaping
from
newgate
and
made
his
way
to
france
where
he
assumed
the
title
of
lord
derwentwater
although
the
earldom
had
ceased
to
exist
under
the
bill
of
attainder
against
his
brother
it
was
this
lord
derwentwater
afterwards
executed
for
taking
part
in
the
rebellion
who
with
several
other
jacobites
is
said
to
have
founded
the
grand
lodge
of
paris
in
and
himself
to
have
become
grand
master
the
jacobite
character
of
the
paris
lodge
is
not
a
matter
of
dispute
gould
relates
that
the
colleagues
of
lord
derwentwater
are
stated
to
have
been
a
chevalier
maskeline
a
squire
heguerty
and
others
all
partisans
of
the
stuarts
but
he
goes
on
to
contest
the
theory
that
they
used
freemasonry
in
the
stuart
cause
which
he
regards
as
amounting
to
a
charge
of
bad
faith
this
is
surely
unreasonable
the
founders
of
grand
lodge
in
paris
did
not
derive
from
grand
lodge
in
london
from
which
they
held
no
warrant
but
as
we
have
seen
took
their
freemasonry
with
them
to
france
before
grand
lodge
of
london
was
instituted
they
were
therefore
in
no
way
bound
by
its
regulations
and
until
the
constitutions
of
anderson
were
published
in
no
rule
had
been
laid
down
that
the
lodges
should
be
in
the
old
days
freemasonry
had
always
been
royalist
as
we
see
from
the
ancient
charges
that
members
should
be
true
liegemen
of
the
king
and
if
the
adherents
of
james
edward
saw
in
him
their
rightful
sovereign
they
may
have
conceived
that
they
were
using
freemasonry
for
a
lawful
purpose
in
adapting
it
to
his
cause
so
although
we
may
applaud
the
decision
of
the
london
freemasons
to
purge
freemasonry
of
political
tendencies
and
transform
it
into
a
harmonious
system
of
brotherhood
we
can
not
accuse
the
jacobites
in
france
of
bad
faith
in
not
conforming
to
a
decision
in
which
they
had
taken
no
part
and
in
establishing
lodges
on
their
own
lines
unfortunately
however
as
too
frequently
happens
when
men
form
secret
confederacies
for
a
wholly
honourable
purpose
their
ranks
were
penetrated
by
confederates
of
another
kind
it
has
been
said
in
an
earlier
chapter
that
according
to
the
documents
produced
by
the
du
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
templars
had
never
ceased
to
exist
in
spite
of
their
official
suppression
in
and
that
a
line
of
grand
masters
had
succeeded
each
other
in
unbroken
succession
from
jacques
du
molay
to
the
duc
de
who
was
killed
in
the
grand
master
appointed
in
is
stated
to
have
been
philippe
duc
later
the
regent
waite
has
expressed
the
opinion
that
all
this
was
an
invention
of
the
late
eighteenth
century
and
that
the
charter
of
larmenius
was
fabricated
at
this
date
though
not
published
until
by
the
revived
du
under
the
grand
master
fabré
palaprat
but
evidence
points
to
a
contrary
conclusion
matter
who
as
we
have
seen
disbelieves
the
story
of
the
du
and
the
authenticity
of
the
charter
of
larmenius
in
so
far
as
it
professes
to
be
a
genuine
document
nevertheless
asserts
that
the
who
have
examined
it
declare
it
to
date
from
the
early
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
at
which
period
matter
believes
the
gospel
of
john
used
by
the
order
to
have
been
arranged
so
as
to
accompany
the
ceremonies
of
some
masonic
or
secret
society
now
it
was
about
that
a
revival
of
templarism
took
place
in
france
and
germany
we
can
not
therefore
doubt
that
if
matter
is
right
in
this
hypothesis
the
secret
society
in
question
was
that
of
the
templars
whether
they
existed
as
lineal
descendants
of
the
order
or
merely
as
a
revival
of
that
order
the
existence
of
the
german
templars
at
this
date
under
the
name
of
the
which
we
shall
deal
with
in
a
further
chapter
is
indeed
a
fact
disputed
by
no
one
but
that
there
was
also
an
du
in
france
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
must
be
regarded
as
highly
probable
mackey
john
yarker
and
lecouteulx
de
canteleu
who
owing
to
his
possession
of
templar
documents
had
exclusive
sources
of
information
all
declare
this
to
have
been
the
case
and
accept
the
charter
of
larmenius
as
authentic
it
is
quite
certain
says
yarker
that
there
was
at
this
period
in
france
an
du
with
a
charter
from
john
mark
larmenius
who
claimed
appointment
from
jacques
du
molay
philippe
of
orléans
accepted
the
grand
mastership
in
and
signed
the
statutes
without
however
necessarily
accepting
the
charter
of
larmenius
as
authentic
let
us
examine
the
probability
of
this
assertion
with
regard
to
the
duc
amongst
the
jacobites
supporting
lord
derwentwater
at
the
grand
lodge
of
paris
was
a
certain
andrew
michael
ramsay
known
as
chevalier
ramsay
who
was
born
at
ayr
near
the
famous
lodge
of
kilwinning
where
the
templars
are
said
to
have
formed
their
alliance
with
the
masons
in
in
ramsay
was
converted
to
the
roman
catholic
faith
by
fénelon
and
in
became
tutor
to
the
sons
of
the
pretender
at
rome
gould
has
related
that
during
his
stay
in
france
ramsay
had
formed
a
friendship
with
the
regent
philippe
duc
who
was
grand
master
of
the
de
instituted
during
the
crusades
as
a
body
of
hospitallers
devoting
themselves
to
the
care
of
the
lepers
and
which
in
had
been
joined
to
the
du
it
seems
probable
from
all
accounts
that
ramsay
was
a
chevalier
of
this
order
but
he
can
not
have
been
admitted
into
it
by
the
duc
for
the
grand
master
of
the
ordre
de
was
not
the
duc
but
the
marquis
de
dangeau
who
on
his
death
in
was
succeeded
by
the
son
of
the
regent
the
duc
de
chartres
if
then
ramsay
was
admitted
to
any
order
by
the
regent
it
was
surely
the
du
of
which
the
regent
is
said
to
have
been
the
grand
master
at
this
date
now
the
infamous
character
of
the
duc
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
moreover
during
the
regency
that
period
of
impiety
and
moral
dissolution
hitherto
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
france
the
chief
of
council
was
the
duc
de
bourbon
who
later
placed
his
mistress
the
marquise
de
prie
and
the
financier
paris
duverney
at
the
head
of
affairs
thus
creating
a
scandal
of
such
magnitude
that
he
was
exiled
in
through
the
influence
of
cardinal
fleury
this
duc
de
bourbon
in
is
said
to
have
become
grand
master
of
the
temple
it
was
thus
observes
de
canteleu
that
these
two
grand
masters
of
the
temple
degraded
the
royal
authority
and
ceaselessly
increased
hatred
against
the
government
it
would
therefore
seem
strange
that
a
man
so
upright
as
ramsay
appears
to
have
been
who
had
moreover
but
recently
been
converted
to
the
catholic
church
should
have
formed
a
friendship
with
the
dissolute
regent
of
france
unless
there
had
been
some
bond
between
them
but
here
we
have
a
possible
explanation
templarism
doubtless
during
youth
at
kilwinning
many
templar
traditions
had
come
to
his
knowledge
and
if
in
france
he
found
himself
befriended
by
the
grand
master
himself
what
wonder
that
he
should
have
entered
into
an
alliance
which
resulted
in
his
admission
to
an
order
he
had
been
accustomed
to
revere
and
which
moreover
was
represented
to
him
as
the
et
of
the
masonic
brotherhood
to
which
he
also
belonged
it
is
thus
that
we
find
ramsay
in
the
very
year
that
the
duc
de
bourbon
is
said
to
have
been
made
grand
master
of
the
temple
artlessly
writing
to
cardinal
fleury
asking
him
to
extend
his
protection
to
the
society
of
freemasons
in
paris
and
enclosing
a
copy
of
the
speech
which
he
was
to
deliver
on
the
following
day
march
it
is
in
this
famous
oration
that
for
the
first
time
we
find
freemasonry
traced
to
the
crusades
at
the
time
of
the
crusades
in
palestine
many
princes
lords
and
citizens
associated
themselves
and
vowed
to
restore
the
temple
of
the
christians
in
the
holy
land
and
to
employ
themselves
in
bringing
back
their
architecture
to
its
first
institution
they
agreed
upon
several
ancient
signs
and
symbolic
words
drawn
from
the
well
of
religion
in
order
to
recognize
themselves
amongst
the
heathens
and
saracens
these
signs
and
words
were
only
communicated
to
those
who
promised
solemnly
and
even
sometimes
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
never
to
reveal
them
this
sacred
promise
was
therefore
not
an
execrable
oath
as
it
has
been
called
but
a
respectable
bond
to
unite
christians
of
all
nationalities
into
one
confraternity
some
time
afterwards
our
order
formed
an
intimate
union
with
the
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
from
that
time
our
lodges
took
the
name
of
lodges
of
st
john
this
speech
of
ramsay
has
raised
a
storm
of
controversy
amongst
freemasons
because
it
contains
a
very
decided
hint
of
a
connexion
between
templarism
and
freemasonry
tuckett
in
the
paper
referred
to
above
points
out
that
only
the
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
are
here
mentioned
but
ramsay
distinctly
speaks
of
our
order
forming
a
union
with
the
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
and
we
know
that
the
templars
did
eventually
form
such
a
union
the
fact
that
ramsay
does
not
mention
the
templars
by
name
admits
of
a
very
plausible
explanation
it
must
be
remembered
that
as
gould
has
shown
a
copy
of
the
oration
was
enclosed
by
ramsay
in
his
letter
to
cardinal
fleury
appealing
for
royal
protection
to
be
extended
to
freemasonry
it
is
therefore
hardly
likely
that
he
would
have
proclaimed
a
connexion
between
the
order
he
was
anxious
to
present
in
the
most
favourable
light
and
one
which
had
formerly
been
suppressed
by
king
and
pope
moreover
if
the
charter
of
larmenius
is
to
be
believed
the
newly
elected
grand
master
of
the
temple
was
the
duc
de
bourbon
who
had
already
incurred
the
displeasure
obviously
therefore
templar
influence
was
kept
in
the
background
this
is
not
to
imply
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
ramsay
who
doubtless
held
the
order
of
templars
to
be
wholly
praiseworthy
but
he
could
not
expect
the
king
or
cardinal
to
share
his
view
and
therefore
held
it
more
prudent
to
refer
to
the
progenitors
of
freemasonry
under
the
vague
description
of
a
crusading
body
ramsay
effort
met
however
with
no
success
whether
on
account
of
this
unlucky
reference
by
which
the
cardinal
may
have
detected
templar
influence
or
for
some
other
reason
the
appeal
for
royal
protection
was
not
only
refused
but
the
new
order
which
hitherto
catholics
had
been
allowed
to
enter
was
now
prohibited
by
royal
edict
in
the
following
year
the
pope
clement
xii
issued
a
bull
banning
freemasonry
and
excommunicating
catholics
who
took
part
in
it
but
this
prohibition
appears
to
have
been
without
effect
for
freemasonry
not
only
prospered
but
soon
began
to
manufacture
new
degrees
and
in
the
masonic
literature
of
the
following
thirty
years
the
templar
tradition
becomes
still
more
clearly
apparent
thus
the
chevalier
de
bérage
in
a
pamphlet
of
which
the
first
edition
is
said
to
have
appeared
in
gives
the
following
account
of
the
origins
of
freemasonry
this
order
was
instituted
by
godefroi
de
bouillon
in
palestine
in
after
the
decadence
of
the
christian
armies
and
was
only
communicated
to
the
french
masons
some
time
after
and
to
a
very
small
number
as
a
reward
for
the
obliging
services
they
rendered
to
several
of
our
english
and
scottish
knights
from
whom
true
masonry
is
taken
their
metropolitan
lodge
is
situated
on
the
mountain
of
heredom
where
the
first
lodge
was
held
in
europe
and
which
exists
in
all
its
splendour
the
general
council
is
still
held
there
and
it
is
the
seal
of
the
sovereign
grand
master
in
office
this
mountain
is
situated
between
the
west
and
north
of
scotland
at
sixty
miles
from
edinburgh
apart
from
the
historical
confusion
of
the
first
sentence
this
passage
is
of
interest
as
evidence
that
the
theory
of
a
connexion
between
certain
crusading
knights
and
the
lodge
of
heredom
of
kilwinning
was
current
as
early
as
the
baron
tschoudy
in
his
which
appeared
in
says
that
the
crusading
origin
of
freemasonry
is
the
one
officially
taught
in
the
lodges
where
candidates
for
initiation
are
told
that
several
knights
who
had
set
forth
to
rescue
the
holy
places
of
palestine
from
the
saracens
formed
an
association
under
the
name
of
free
masons
thus
indicating
that
their
principal
desire
was
the
reconstruction
of
the
temple
of
solomon
that
further
they
adopted
certain
signs
grips
and
passwords
as
a
defence
against
the
saracens
and
finally
that
our
society
fraternized
on
the
footing
of
an
order
with
the
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
from
which
it
is
apparent
that
the
freemasons
borrowed
the
custom
of
regarding
john
as
the
patron
of
the
whole
order
in
general
after
the
crusades
the
masons
kept
their
rites
and
methods
and
in
this
way
perpetuated
the
royal
art
by
establishing
lodges
first
in
england
then
in
scotland
etc
in
this
account
therefore
freemasonry
is
represented
as
having
been
instituted
for
the
defence
of
christian
doctrines
de
bérage
expresses
the
same
view
and
explains
that
the
object
of
these
crusaders
in
thus
binding
themselves
together
was
to
protect
their
lives
against
the
saracens
by
enveloping
their
sacred
doctrines
in
a
veil
of
mystery
for
this
purpose
they
made
use
of
jewish
symbolism
which
they
invested
with
a
christian
meaning
thus
the
temple
of
solomon
was
used
to
denote
the
church
of
christ
the
bough
of
acacia
signified
the
cross
the
square
and
the
compass
the
union
between
the
old
and
new
testaments
etc
so
the
mysteries
of
masonry
were
in
their
principle
and
are
still
nothing
else
than
those
of
the
christian
religion
baron
tschoudy
however
declares
that
all
this
stops
short
of
the
truth
that
freemasonry
originated
long
before
the
crusades
in
palestine
and
that
the
real
ancestors
fathers
authors
of
the
masons
those
illustrious
men
of
whom
i
will
not
say
the
date
nor
betray
the
secret
were
a
disciplined
body
whom
tschoudy
describes
by
the
name
of
the
knights
of
the
aurora
and
palestine
after
the
almost
total
destruction
of
the
jewish
people
these
knights
had
always
hoped
to
regain
possession
of
the
domains
of
their
fathers
and
to
rebuild
the
temple
and
they
carefully
preserved
their
regulations
and
particular
liturgy
together
with
a
sublime
treatise
which
was
the
object
of
their
continual
study
and
of
their
philosophical
speculations
tschoudy
further
relates
that
they
were
students
of
the
occult
sciences
of
which
alchemy
formed
a
part
and
that
they
had
abjured
the
principles
of
the
jewish
religion
in
order
to
follow
the
lights
of
the
christian
faith
at
the
time
of
the
crusades
the
knights
of
palestine
came
out
from
the
desert
of
the
thebaïd
where
they
had
remained
hidden
and
joined
to
themselves
some
of
the
crusaders
who
had
remained
in
jerusalem
declaring
that
they
were
the
descendants
of
the
masons
who
had
worked
on
the
temple
of
solomon
they
professed
to
concern
themselves
with
speculative
architecure
which
served
to
disguise
a
more
glorious
point
of
view
from
this
time
they
took
the
name
of
free
masons
presented
themselves
under
this
title
to
the
crusading
armies
and
assembled
under
their
banners
it
would
of
course
be
absurd
to
regard
any
of
the
foregoing
accounts
as
historical
facts
the
important
point
is
that
they
tend
to
prove
the
fallacy
of
supposing
that
the
theory
originated
with
the
revived
du
since
one
corresponding
to
it
so
closely
was
current
in
the
middle
of
the
preceding
century
it
is
true
that
in
these
earlier
accounts
the
actual
words
johannite
and
templar
do
not
occur
but
the
resemblance
between
the
sect
of
jews
professing
the
christian
faith
but
possessing
a
particular
liturgy
and
a
sublime
treatise
apparently
some
early
form
of
the
cabala
dealing
with
occult
science
and
the
mandæans
or
johannites
with
their
cabalistic
book
of
adam
their
book
of
john
and
their
ritual
is
at
once
apparent
further
the
allusions
to
the
connexion
between
the
knights
who
had
been
indoctrinated
in
the
holy
land
and
the
scottish
lodges
coincides
exactly
with
the
templar
tradition
published
not
only
by
the
du
but
handed
down
in
the
royal
order
of
scotland
from
all
this
the
following
facts
stand
out
that
whilst
british
craft
masonry
traced
its
origin
to
the
operative
guilds
of
masons
the
freemasons
of
france
from
onwards
placed
the
origin
of
the
order
in
crusading
chivalry
that
it
was
amongst
these
freemasons
that
the
upper
degrees
known
as
the
scottish
rite
arose
and
that
as
we
shall
now
see
these
degrees
clearly
suggest
templar
inspiration
the
earliest
form
of
the
upper
degrees
appears
to
have
been
the
one
given
by
de
bérage
as
follows
parfait
maçon
élu
élu
de
perignan
élu
des
quinze
petit
architecte
grand
architecte
chevalier
de
et
de
noachite
ou
chevalier
prussien
the
first
of
these
to
make
its
appearance
is
believed
to
have
been
the
one
here
assigned
to
the
sixth
place
this
degree
known
in
modern
masonry
as
prince
of
the
of
heredom
or
knight
of
the
pelican
and
eagle
became
the
eighteenth
and
the
most
important
degree
in
what
was
later
called
the
scottish
rite
or
at
the
present
time
in
england
the
ancient
and
accepted
rite
why
was
this
rite
called
scottish
it
can
not
be
too
strongly
insisted
on
says
gould
that
all
scottish
masonry
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
grand
lodge
of
scotland
nor
with
one
possible
exception
that
of
the
royal
order
of
scotland
did
it
ever
originate
in
that
country
but
in
the
case
of
the
degree
there
is
surely
some
justification
for
the
term
in
legend
if
not
in
proven
fact
for
as
we
have
already
seen
according
to
the
tradition
of
the
royal
order
of
scotland
this
degree
had
been
contained
in
it
since
the
fourteenth
century
when
the
degrees
of
heredom
and
rosy
cross
are
said
to
have
been
instituted
by
robert
bruce
in
collaboration
with
the
templars
after
the
battle
of
bannockburn
mackey
is
one
of
the
few
masons
who
admit
this
probable
affiliation
and
in
referring
to
the
tradition
of
the
royal
order
of
scotland
observes
from
that
order
it
seems
to
us
by
no
means
improbable
that
the
present
degree
of
de
heredom
may
have
taken
its
origin
but
the
degree
like
the
templar
tradition
from
which
it
appears
to
have
descended
is
capable
of
a
dual
interpretation
or
rather
of
a
multiple
interpretation
for
no
degree
in
masonry
has
been
subject
to
so
many
variations
that
on
the
continent
it
had
descended
through
the
rosicrucians
in
an
alchemical
form
seems
more
than
probable
it
would
certainly
be
difficult
to
believe
that
a
degree
of
was
imported
from
the
east
and
incorporated
in
the
royal
order
of
scotland
in
that
by
a
mere
coincidence
a
man
named
christian
rosenkreutz
was
according
to
the
rosicrucian
legend
born
in
the
same
century
and
transmitted
a
secret
doctrine
he
had
discovered
in
the
east
to
the
brethren
of
the
rosy
cross
and
finally
that
a
degree
of
the
was
founded
in
circ
without
any
connexion
existing
between
these
succeeding
movements
even
if
we
deny
direct
affiliation
we
must
surely
admit
a
common
source
of
inspiration
producing
if
not
a
continuation
at
any
rate
a
periodic
revival
of
the
same
ideas
oliver
indeed
admits
affiliation
between
the
fraternity
and
the
degree
and
after
pointing
out
that
the
first
indication
of
the
degree
appears
in
the
in
goes
on
to
say
it
was
known
much
sooner
although
not
probably
as
a
degree
in
masonry
for
it
existed
as
a
cabalistic
science
from
the
earliest
times
in
egypt
greece
and
rome
as
well
as
amongst
the
jews
and
moors
in
times
more
recent
and
in
our
own
country
the
names
of
roger
bacon
fludd
ashmole
and
many
others
are
found
in
its
list
of
adepts
mackey
quoting
this
passage
observes
that
oliver
confounds
the
masonic
with
the
alchemical
rosicrucians
and
proceeds
to
give
an
account
of
the
degree
as
worked
in
england
and
america
which
he
truly
describes
as
in
the
strictest
sense
a
christian
degree
but
the
point
mackey
overlooks
is
that
this
is
only
one
version
of
the
degree
which
as
we
shall
see
later
has
been
and
still
is
worked
in
a
very
different
manner
on
the
continent
it
is
however
certain
that
the
version
of
the
degree
first
adopted
by
the
freemasons
of
france
in
about
was
not
only
so
christian
but
so
catholic
in
character
as
to
have
given
rise
to
the
belief
that
it
was
devised
by
the
jesuits
in
order
to
counteract
the
attacks
of
which
catholicism
was
the
object
in
a
paper
on
the
additional
degrees
tuckett
writes
there
is
undeniable
evidence
that
in
their
the
ecossais
or
scots
degrees
were
roman
catholic
i
have
a
ms
ritual
in
french
of
what
i
believe
to
be
the
chev
de
or
souverain
prince
de
and
in
it
the
new
law
is
declared
to
be
la
foy
catholique
and
the
baron
tschoudy
in
his
of
describes
the
same
degree
as
le
catholicisme
mis
en
grade
vol
i
suggest
that
ecossais
or
scots
masonry
was
intended
to
be
a
roman
catholic
as
well
as
a
stuart
form
of
freemasonry
in
which
none
but
those
devoted
to
both
restorations
were
to
be
admitted
but
is
it
necessary
to
read
this
political
intention
into
the
degree
if
the
tradition
of
the
royal
order
of
scotland
is
to
be
believed
the
idea
of
the
degree
was
far
older
than
the
stuart
cause
and
dated
back
to
bannockburn
when
the
degree
of
heredom
with
which
it
was
coupled
was
instituted
in
order
to
correct
the
errors
and
reform
the
abuses
which
had
crept
in
among
the
three
degrees
of
masonry
and
to
provide
a
christianized
form
of
the
third
degree
purified
of
the
dross
of
paganism
and
even
of
judaism
whether
the
antiquity
attributed
to
these
degrees
can
be
proved
or
not
it
certainly
appears
probable
that
the
legend
of
the
royal
order
of
scotland
had
some
foundation
in
fact
and
therefore
that
the
ideas
embodied
in
the
degree
may
have
been
drawn
from
the
store
of
that
order
and
brought
by
the
jacobites
to
france
at
the
same
time
there
is
no
evidence
in
support
of
the
statement
made
by
certain
continental
writers
that
ramsay
actually
instituted
this
or
any
of
the
upper
degrees
on
the
contrary
in
his
oration
he
expressly
states
that
freemasonry
is
composed
of
the
craft
degrees
only
we
have
amongst
us
three
kinds
of
brothers
novices
or
apprentices
fellows
or
professed
brothers
masters
or
perfected
brethren
to
the
first
are
explained
the
moral
virtues
to
the
second
the
heroic
virtues
to
the
last
the
christian
virtues
it
might
be
said
then
that
the
degree
was
here
foreshadowed
in
the
masters
degree
in
that
the
latter
definitely
inculcated
christianity
this
would
be
perfectly
in
accord
with
ramsay
point
of
view
as
set
forth
in
his
account
of
his
conversion
by
fénelon
when
he
first
met
the
archbishop
of
cambrai
in
ramsay
relates
that
he
had
lost
faith
in
all
christian
sects
and
had
resolved
to
take
refuge
in
a
wise
deism
limited
to
respect
for
the
divinity
and
for
the
immutable
ideas
of
pure
virtue
but
that
his
conversation
with
fénelon
led
him
to
accept
the
catholic
faith
and
he
goes
on
to
show
that
monsieur
de
cambrai
turned
atheists
into
deists
deists
into
christians
and
christians
into
catholics
by
a
sequence
of
ideas
full
of
enlightenment
and
feeling
might
not
this
be
the
process
which
ramsay
aimed
at
introducing
into
freemasonry
the
process
which
in
fact
does
form
part
of
the
masonic
system
in
england
where
the
atheist
must
become
at
least
by
profession
a
deist
before
he
can
be
admitted
to
the
craft
degrees
whilst
the
degree
is
reserved
solely
for
those
who
profess
the
christian
faith
such
was
undoubtedly
the
idea
of
the
men
who
introduced
the
degree
into
france
and
ragon
who
gives
an
account
of
this
ancien
francais
which
is
almost
identical
with
the
degree
now
worked
in
england
but
long
since
abandoned
in
france
objects
to
it
on
the
very
score
of
its
christian
character
in
this
respect
the
amongst
all
the
upper
degrees
introduced
to
france
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
stands
alone
and
it
alone
can
with
any
probability
be
attributed
to
scottish
jacobite
inspiration
it
was
not
in
fact
until
three
or
four
years
after
lord
derwentwater
or
his
mysterious
successor
lord
harnouester
had
resigned
the
grand
mastership
in
favour
of
the
duc
in
that
the
additional
degrees
were
first
heard
of
and
it
was
not
until
eight
years
after
the
stuart
cause
had
received
its
at
culloden
that
is
to
say
in
that
the
rite
of
perfection
in
which
the
scots
degrees
were
incorporated
was
drawn
up
in
the

we
have
only
to

at
the
nomenclature
of
the
last
of
these
degrees
to
see
that
on
the
basis
of
mere
operative
masonry
there
has
been
built
up
a
system
composed
of
two
elements
crusading
chivalry
and
judaic
tradition
what
else
is
this
but
templarism
even
gould
usually
so
reticent
on
templar
influence
admits
it
at
this
period
in
france
some
of
the
scots
lodges
would
appear
to
have
very
early
manufactured
new
degrees
connecting
these
very
distinguished
scots
masons
with
the
knights
templar
and
thus
given
rise
to
the
subsequent
flood
of
templarism
the
earliest
of
all
are
supposed
to
have
been
the
masons
of
lyons
who
invented
the
kadosch
degree
representing
the
vengeance
of
the
templars
in
from
that
time
new
rites
multiplied
in
france
and
germany
but
all
those
of
french
origin
contain
knightly
and
almost
all
templar
grades
in
every
case
the
connecting
link
was
composed
of
one
or
more
scots
degrees
the
name
kadosch
here
mentioned
is
a
hebrew
word
signifying
holy
or
consecrated
which
in
the
cabala
is
found
in
conjunction
with
the
tetragrammaton
the
degree
is
said
to
have
developed
from
that
of
grand
elect
one
of
the
three
degrees
of
vengeance
celebrating
with
sanguinary
realism
the
avenging
of
the
murder
of
hiram
but
in
its
final
form
of
knight
kadosch
later
to
become
the
thirtieth
degree
of
the
ancient
and
accepted
scottish
rite
the
hiramic
legend
was
changed
into
the
history
of
the
templars
with
jacques
du
molay
as
the
victim
so
the
reprobation
of
attack
on
authority
personified
by
the
becomes
approbation
of
attack
on
authority
in
the
person
of
the
king
of
france
the
introduction
of
the
upper
degrees
with
their
political
and
later
on
tendencies
thus
marked
a
complete
departure
from
the
fundamental
principle
of
freemasonry
that
nothing
concerning
the
religion
or
government
shall
ever
be
spoken
of
in
the
lodge
for
this
reason
they
have
been
assailed
not
only
by
writers
but
by
freemasons
themselves
to
represent
barruel
and
robison
as
the
enemies
of
freemasonry
is
therefore
absolutely
false
neither
of
these
men
denounced
craft
masonry
as
practised
in
england
but
only
the
superstructure
erected
on
the
continent
barruel
indeed
incurs
the
reproaches
of
mounier
for
his
championship
of
english
freemasons
he
vaunts
their
respect
for
religious
opinion
and
for
authority
when
he
speaks
of
freemasons
in
general
they
are
impious
rebellious
successors
of
the
templars
and
albigenses
but
those
of
england
are
more
than
this
all
the
entered
apprentices
fellow
crafts
and
master
masons
in
all
parts
of
the
world
are
innocent
there
are
only
guilty
ones
in
the
higher
degrees
which
are
not
essential
to
the
institution
and
are
sought
by
a
small
number
of
people
in
this
opinion
of
barruel
a
great
number
of
masonic
writers
concur
clavel
ragon
rebold
thory
findel
and
others
too
numerous
to
mention
all
indicate
craft
masonry
as
the
only
true
kind
and
the
upper
degrees
as
constituting
a
danger
to
the
order
rebold
who
gives
a
list
of
these
writers
quotes
a
masonic
publication
authorized
by
the
grand
orient
and
the
supreme
council
of
france
in
which
it
is
said
that
from
all
these
rites
there
result
the
most
foolish
conceptions
the
most
absurd
legends
the
most
extravagant
systems
the
most
immoral
principles
and
those
the
most
dangerous
for
the
peace
and
preservation
of
states
and
that
therefore
except
the
first
three
degrees
of
masonry
which
are
really
ancient
and
universal
everything
is
chimera
extravagance
futility
and
lies
did
barruel
and
robison
ever
use
stronger
language
than
this
to
attribute
the
perversion
of
masonry
to
jacobite
influence
would
be
absurd
how
could
it
be
supposed
that
either
ramsay
or
lord
derwentwater
who
died
as
a
devout
catholic
on
the
scaffold
in
could
have
been
concerned
in
an
attempt
to
undermine
the
catholic
faith
or
the
monarchy
of
france
i
would
suggest
then
that
the
term
scots
masonry
became
simply
a
veil
for
templarism
templarism
moreover
of
a
very
different
kind
to
that
from
which
the
original
degree
of
the
was
derived
it
was
this
scots
masonry
that
after
the
resignation
of
lord
derwentwater
boldly
came
forward
and
claimed
to
be
not
merely
a
part
of
masonry
but
the
real
masonry
possessed
of
superior
knowledge
and
entitled
to
greater
privileges
and
the
right
to
rule
over
the
ordinary
craft
masonry
the
grand
lodge
of
france
seems
however
to
have
realized
the
danger
of
submitting
to
the
domination
of
the
templar
element
and
on
the
death
of
the
duc
and
his
replacement
by
the
comte
de
clermont
in
signified
its
adherence
to
english
craft
masonry
by
proclaiming
itself
grande
loge
de
france
and
reissued
the
constitutions
of
anderson
first
published
in
with
the
injunction
that
the
scots
masters
should
be
placed
on
the
same
level
as
the
simple
apprentices
and
fellow
crafts
and
allowed
to
wear
no
badges
of
distinction
grand
lodge
of
england
appears
to
have
been
reassured
by
this
proclamation
as
to
the
character
of
french
freemasonry
for
now
in
it
at
last
delivered
a
warrant
to
grand
lodge
of
france
yet
in
reality
it
was
from
this
moment
that
french
freemasonry
degenerated
the
most
rapidly
the
order
was
soon
invaded
by
intriguers
this
was
rendered
all
the
easier
by
the
apathy
of
the
comte
de
clermont
appointed
grand
master
in
who
seems
to
have
taken
little
interest
in
the
order
and
employed
a
substitute
in
the
person
of
a
dancing
master
named
lacorne
a
man
of
low
character
through
whose
influence
the
lodges
fell
into
a
state
of
anarchy
freemasonry
was
thus
divided
into
warring
factions
lacorne
and
the
crowd
of
supporters
who
had
followed
him
into
the
lodges
founded
a
grand
lodge
of
their
own
grande
loge
lacorne
and
in
the
original
freemasons
again
attempted
to
make
craft
masonry
the
national
masonry
of
france
by
deleting
the
word
anglaise
from
the
appellation
of
grand
lodge
and
renaming
it
grand
loge
nationale
de
france
but
many
lodges
still
continue
to
work
the
additional
degrees
the
rivalry
between
the
two
groups
became
so
violent
that
in
the
government
intervened
and
closed
down
grand
lodge
the
templar
group
had
however
formed
two
separate
associations
the
knights
of
the
east
and
the
council
of
the
emperors
of
the
east
and
west
in
a
jew
named
stephen
morin
was
sent
to
america
by
the
emperors
armed
with
a
warrant
from
the
duc
de
clermont
and
grand
lodge
of
paris
and
bearing
the
sonorous
title
of
grand
elect
perfect
and
sublime
master
with
orders
to
establish
a
lodge
in
that
country
in
he
was
accused
in
grand
lodge
of
propagating
strange
and
monstrous
doctrines
and
his
patent
of
grand
inspector
was
withdrawn
morin
however
had
succeeded
in
establishing
the
rite
of
perfection
sixteen
inspectors
nearly
all
jews
were
now
appointed
these
included
isaac
iong
isaac
de
costa
moses
hayes
spitser
moses
cohen
abraham
jacobs
and
hyman
long
meanwhile
in
france
the
closing
of
grand
lodge
had
not
prevented
meetings
of
lacorne
group
which
on
the
death
of
the
duc
de
clermont
in
instituted
the
grand
orient
with
the
duc
de
chartres
the
future
philippe
égalité
as
grand
master
the
grand
orient
then
invited
the
grande
loge
to
revoke
the
decree
of
expulsion
and
unite
with
it
and
this
offer
being
accepted
the
revolutionary
party
inevitably
carried
all
before
it
and
the
duc
de
chartres
was
declared
grand
master
of
all
the
councils
chapters
and
scotch
lodges
of
france
in
the
council
of
emperors
and
the
knights
of
the
east
combined
to
form
the
grand
chapitre
général
de
france
which
in
joined
up
with
the
grand
orient
the
victory
of
the
revolutionary
party
was
then
complete
it
is
necessary
to
enter
into
all
these
tedious
details
in
order
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
factions
grouped
together
under
the
banner
of
masonry
at
this
period
the
martinist
papus
attributes
the
revolutionary
influences
that
now
prevailed
in
the
lodges
to
their
invasion
by
the
templars
and
goes
on
to
explain
that
this
was
owing
to
a
change
that
had
taken
place
in
the
du
under
the
grand
mastership
of
the
regent
and
his
successor
the
duc
de
bourbon
the
revolutionary
elements
amongst
the
templars
had
had
full
play
but
from
onwards
the
grand
masters
of
the
order
were
supporters
of
the
monarchy
when
the
revolution
came
the
duc
de
who
had
been
grand
master
since
perished
amongst
the
defenders
of
the
throne
it
was
thus
that
by
the
middle
of
the
century
the
order
of
the
temple
ceased
to
be
a
revolutionary
force
and
the
discontented
elements
it
had
contained
no
longer
able
to
find
in
it
a
refuge
threw
themselves
into
freemasonry
and
entering
the
higher
degrees
turned
them
to
their
subversive
purpose
according
to
papus
lacorne
was
a
member
of
the
templar
group
and
the
dissensions
that
took
place
were
principally
a
fight
between
the
and
the
genuine
freemasons
which
ended
in
the
triumph
of
the
former
victorious
rebels
thus
founded
the
grand
orient
of
france
so
a
contemporary
mason
is
able
to
write
it
is
not
excessive
to
say
that
the
masonic
revolution
of
was
the
prelude
and
the
precursor
of
the
revolution
of
what
must
be
well
observed
is
the
secret
action
of
the
brothers
of
the
templar
rite
it
is
they
who
are
the
real
fomentors
of
revolution
the
others
are
only
docile
agents
but
all
this
attributes
the
baneful
influence
of
templarism
to
the
french
templars
alone
and
the
existence
of
such
a
body
rests
on
no
absolutely
certain
evidence
what
is
certain
and
admits
of
no
denial
on
the
part
of
any
historian
is
the
inauguration
of
a
templar
order
in
germany
at
the
very
moment
when
the
scottish
degrees
were
introduced
into
french
masonry
we
shall
now
return
to
and
follow
events
that
were
taking
place
at
this
important
moment
beyond
the
rhine
german
templarism
and
french
illuminism
the
year
after
ramsay
oration
that
is
to
say
in
frederick
crown
prince
of
prussia
the
future
frederick
the
great
who
for
two
years
had
been
carrying
on
a
correspondence
with
voltaire
suddenly
evinced
a
curiosity
to
know
the
secrets
of
freemasonry
which
he
had
hitherto
derided
as
kinderspiel
and
accordingly
went
through
a
hasty
initiation
during
the
night
of
august
whilst
passing
through
brunswick
the
ceremony
took
place
not
at
a
masonic
lodge
but
at
a
hotel
in
the
presence
of
a
deputation
summoned
by
the
graf
von
from
grand
lodge
of
hamburg
for
the
occasion
it
is
evident
that
something
of
an
unusual
kind
must
have
occurred
to
necessitate
these
speedy
and
makeshift
arrangements
carlyle
in
his
account
of
the
episode
endeavours
to
pass
it
off
as
a
very
trifling
circumstance
a
reason
the
more
for
regarding
it
as
of
the
highest
importance
since
we
know
now
from
facts
that
have
recently
come
to
light
how
carefully
carlyle
was
by
potsdam
whilst
writing
his
book
on
frederick
the
great
but
let
us
follow
frederick
masonic
career
in
june
after
his
accession
to
the
throne
his
interest
in
masonry
had
clearly
not
waned
for
we
find
him
presiding
over
a
lodge
at
charlottenburg
where
he
received
into
the
order
two
of
his
brothers
his
and
duke
frederick
william
of
at
his
desire
the
baron
de
bielfeld
and
his
privy
councillor
jordan
founded
a
lodge
at
berlin
the
three
globes
which
by
had
no
less
than
fourteen
lodges
under
its
jurisdiction
in
this
same
year
of
voltaire
in
response
to
urgent
invitations
paid
his
first
visit
to
frederick
the
great
in
germany
voltaire
is
usually
said
not
to
have
yet
become
a
mason
and
the
date
of
his
initiation
is
supposed
to
have
been
when
he
was
received
into
the
des
neuf
in
paris
but
this
by
no
means
precludes
the
possibility
that
he
had
belonged
to
another
masonic
order
at
an
earlier
date
at
any
rate
voltaire
visit
to
germany
was
followed
by
two
remarkable
events
in
the
masonic
world
of
france
the
first
of
these
was
the
institution
of
the
additional
degrees
the
second
perhaps
not
wholly
unconnected
with
the
first
was
the
arrival
in
paris
of
a
masonic
delegate
from
germany
named
von
marschall
who
brought
with
him
instructions
for
a
new
or
rather
a
revived
order
of
templarism
in
which
he
attempted
to
interest
prince
charles
edward
and
his
followers
von
marschall
was
followed
about
two
years
later
by
baron
von
hunt
who
had
been
initiated
in
into
the
three
degrees
of
craft
masonry
in
germany
and
now
came
to
consecrate
a
lodge
in
paris
according
to
von
hundt
own
account
he
was
then
received
into
the
order
of
the
temple
by
an
unknown
knight
of
the
red
plume
in
the
presence
of
lord
kilmarnock
and
was
presented
as
a
distinguished
brother
to
prince
charles
edward
whom
he
imagined
to
be
grand
master
of
the
order
but
all
this
was
afterwards
shown
to
be
a
pure
frabrication
for
prince
charles
edward
dened
all
knowledge
of
the
affair
and
von
hundt
himself
admitted
later
that
he
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
lodge
or
chapter
in
which
he
was
received
but
that
he
was
directed
from
a
hidden
centre
and
by
unknown
superiors
whose
identity
he
was
bound
not
to
reveal
in
reality
it
appears
that
von
hundt
account
was
exactly
the
opposite
of
the
truth
and
that
it
was
von
hundt
who
seconding
von
marschall
effort
tried
to
enrol
prince
charles
edward
in
the
new
german
order
by
assuring
him
that
he
could
raise
powerful
support
for
the
stuart
cause
under
the
cover
of
reorganizing
the
templar
order
of
which
he
claimed
to
possess
the
true
secrets
handed
down
from
the
knights
of
the
fourteenth
century
by
way
of
further
rehabilitating
the
order
von
hundt
declared
that
all
the
accusations
brought
against
it
by
philippe
le
bel
and
the
pope
were
based
on
false
charges
manufactured
by
two
recreant
knights
named
noffodei
and
florian
as
a
revenge
for
having
been
deprived
of
their
commands
by
the
order
in
consequence
of
certain
crimes
they
had
committed
according
to
lecouteulx
de
canteleu
von
hundt
eventually
succeeded
after
the
defeat
of
culloden
in
persuading
prince
charles
edward
to
enter
his
order
but
this
is
extremely
doubtful
at
any
rate
when
in
von
hundt
officially
founded
his
new
templar
order
under
the
name
of
the
the
unfortunate
charles
edward
played
no
part
at
all
in
the
scheme
as
gould
has
truly
observed
no
trace
of
jacobite
intrigues
ever
blended
with
the
teaching
of
the
the
of
the
stricte
was
in
reality
a
purely
german
association
composed
of
men
drawn
entirely
from
the
intellectual
and
aristocratic
classes
and
in
imitation
of
the
chivalric
orders
of
the
past
known
to
each
other
under
knightly
titles
thus
prince
charles
of
hesse
became
eques
a
leone
resurgente
duke
ferdinand
of
brunswick
eques
a
victoria
the
prussian
minister
von
bischoffswerder
eques
a
grypho
baron
de
wachter
eques
a
ceraso
christian
bode
councillor
of
legation
in
eques
a
lilio
convallium
von
haugwitz
cabinet
minister
of
frederick
the
great
eques
a
monte
sancto
etc
but
according
to
the
declarations
of
the
order
the
official
leaders
knights
of
the
moon
the
star
the
golden
sun
or
of
the
sacred
mountain
were
simply
the
real
leaders
known
as
the
unknown
superiors
remained
in
the
background
unadorned
by
titles
of
chivalry
but
exercising
supreme
jurisdiction
over
the
order
the
system
had
been
foreshadowed
by
the
invisibles
of
rosicrucianism
but
now
instead
of
an
intangible
group
whose
very
existence
was
only
known
vaguely
to
the
world
there
appeared
in
the
light
of
day
a
powerful
organization
led
apparently
by
men
of
influence
and
position
yet
secretly
directed
by
hidden
chiefs
mirabeau
has
described
the
advent
of
these
mysterious
directors
in
the
following
passage
in
about
there
appeared
as
if
they
had
come
out
of
the
ground
men
sent
they
said
by
unknown
superiors
and
armed
with
powers
to
reform
the
order
of
freemasonry
and
it
in
its
ancient
purity
one
of
these
missionaries
named
johnston
came
to
weimar
and
jena
where
he
established
himself
he
was
received
in
the
best
way
in
the
world
by
the
brothers
freemasons
who
were
lured
by
the
hope
of
great
secrets
of
important
discoveries
which
were
never
made
known
to
them
now
in
the
manuscripts
of
the
prince
of
hesse
published
by
lecouteulx
de
canteleu
it
is
said
that
this
man
johnston
or
rather
johnson
who
proclaimed
himself
to
be
grand
prior
of
the
order
was
a
jew
named
leicht
or
leucht
gould
says
that
his
real
name
was
either
leucht
or
becker
but
that
he
professed
to
be
an
englishman
although
unable
to
speak
the
english
language
hence
his
assumption
of
the
name
johnson
gould
has
described
johnson
as
a
consummate
rogue
and
an
unmitigated
vagabond
of
almost
repulsive
demeanour
and
of
no
education
but
gifted
with
boundless
impudence
and
low
cunning
indeed
von
hundt
himself
after
enlisting
johnson
services
found
him
too
dangerous
and
declared
him
to
be
an
adventurer
johnson
was
thereupon
arrested
by
von
hundt
friend
the
councillor
von
pritsch
and
thrown
into
the
castle
of
wartburg
where
sudden
death
ended
his
career
it
is
however
improbable
that
mirabeau
could
be
right
in
indicating
johnson
as
one
of
the
unknown
superiors
who
were
doubtless
men
of
vaster
conceptions
than
this
adventurer
appears
to
have
been
moreover
the
manner
of
his
end
clearly
proves
that
he
occupied
a
subordinate
position
in
the
here
then
we
have
a
very
curious
sequence
of
events
which
it
may
be
well
to
recapitulate
briefly
in
order
to
appreciate
their
full
significance
oration
of
chevalier
ramsay
indicating
templar
origin
of
freemasonry
but
making
no
mention
of
upper
degrees
duc
becomes
grand
master
of
french
freemasonry
in
the
place
of
lord
harnouester
frederick

prince
of
prussia
initiated
into
masonry
at
brunswick
voltaire
pays
his
first
visit
to
frederick
now
king
baron
von
marschall
arrives
in
paris
with
a
plan
for
reviving
the
templar
order
templar
degrees
first
heard
of
in
france
under
name
of
scots
masonry
arrival
in
france
of
baron
von
hundt
with
fresh
plans
for
reviving
the
templar
order
degree
of
knight
kadosch
celebrating
vengeance
of
templars
said
to
have
been
instituted
at
lyons
voltaire
goes
to
spend
three
years
with
frederick
templar
order
of
the
stricte
observance
founded
by
von
hundt
rite
of
perfection
early
form
of
scottish
rite
founded
in
france
frederick
acknowledged
head
of
scottish
morin
sent
to
found
rite
of
perfection
in
america
grand
masonic
constitutions
ratified
in
berlin
it
will
be
seen
then
that
what
gould
describes
as
the
flood
of
templarism
which
both
he
and
tuckett
attribute
to
the
scots
masons
corresponds
precisely
with
the
decline
of
jacobite
and
the
rise
of
german
influence
would
it
not
therefore
appear
probable
that
except
in
the
case
of
the
degree
the
authors
of
the
upper
degrees
were
not
scotsmen
nor
jacobites
that
scots
masonry
was
a
term
used
to
cover
not
merely
templarism
but
more
especially
german
templarism
and
that
the
real
author
and
inspirer
of
the
movement
was
frederick
the
great
no
it
is
significant
to
find
that
in
the
history
of
the
du
published
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
frederick
the
great
is
cited
as
one
of
the
most
distinguished
members
of
this
order
in
the
past
and
the
abbé
grégoire
adds
that
he
was
consecrated
at
remersberg
rheinsberg
in
that
is
to
say
in
the
same
year
that
he
was
initiated
into
masonry
at
brunswick
there
is
therefore
a
definite
reason
for
connecting
frederick
with
templarism
at
this
date
i
would
suggest
then
that
the
truth
about
the
templar
succession
may
be
found
in
one
of
the
two
following
theories
that
the
documents
produced
by
the
du
in
the
nineteenth
century
including
the
charter
of
larmenius
were
genuine
that
the
order
had
never
ceased
to
exist
since
the
days
of
the
crusades
that
the
templar
heresy
was
johannism
but
that
this
was
not
held
by
the
templars
who
escaped
to
scotland
that
the
degree
in
its
purely
christian
form
was
introduced
by
the
scottish
templars
to
scotland
and
four
hundred
years
later
brought
by
ramsay
to
france
that
the
master
of
the
temple
at
this
date
was
the
regent
philippe
duc
as
stated
in
the
charter
of
larmenius
finally
that
after
this
fresh
templar
degrees
were
introduced
from
germany
by
von
hundt
acting
on
behalf
of
frederick
the
great
that
the
documents
produced
by
the
du
in
the
nineteenth
century
were
as
matter
declares
early
fabrications
that
although
in
view
of
the
tradition
preserved
in
the
royal
order
of
scotland
there
appears
to
be
good
reason
to
believe
the
story
of
the
scottish
templars
and
the
origin
of
the
degree
the
rest
of
the
history
of
the
templars
including
the
charter
of
larmenius
was
an
invention
of
the
concealed
superiors
of
the
in
germany
and
that
the
most
important
of
these
concealed
superiors
were
frederick
the
great
and
voltaire
i
shall
not
attempt
to
decide
which
of
these
two
theories
is
correct
all
that
i
do
maintain
is
that
in
either
case
the
preponderating
rôle
in
templarism
at
this
crisis
was
played
by
frederick
the
great
probably
with
the
of
voltaire
who
in
his
sur
les
championed
the
cause
of
the
templars
let
us
follow
the
reasons
for
arriving
at
this
conclusion
ramsay
oration
in
connecting
freemasonry
with
the
templars
may
well
have
come
to
the
ears
of
frederick
and
suggested
to
him
the
idea
of
using
masonry
as
a
cover
for
his
intrigues
hence
his
hasty
initiation
at
brunswick
but
in
order
to
acquire
influence
in
a
secret
society
it
is
always
necessary
to
establish
a
claim
to
superior
knowledge
and
templarism
seemed
to
provide
a
fruitful
source
of
inspiration
for
this
purpose
new
light
must
be
thrown
on
the
order
now
there
was
probably
no
one
better
qualified
than
voltaire
with
his
knowledge
of
the
ancient
and
medieval
world
and
hatred
of
the
catholic
church
to
undertake
the
construction
of
a
historical
romance
subversive
of
the
catholic
faith
hence
the
urgent
summons
to
the
philosopher
to
visit
frederick
we
can
imagine
voltaire
delving
amongst
the
records
of
the
past
in
order
to
reconstruct
the
templar
heresy
this
was
clearly
gnostic
and
the
mandæans
or
christians
of
john
may
well
have
appeared
to
present
the
required
characteristics
if
it
could
be
shown
that
here
in
johannism
true
primitive
christianity
was
to
be
found
what
a
blow
for
the
infâme
a
skilful
forger
could
easily
be
found
to
fabricate
the
documents
said
to
have
been
preserved
in
the
secret
archives
of
the
order
further
we
find
von
marschall
arriving
in
the
following
year
in
france
to
reorganize
the
templars
and
von
hundt
later
claiming
to
be
in
possession
of
the
true
secrets
of
the
order
handed
down
from
the
fourteenth
century
that
some
documents
bearing
on
this
question
were
either
discovered
or
fabricated
under
the
direction
of
frederick
the
great
seems
the
more
probable
from
the
existence
of
a
masonic
tradition
to
this
effect
thus
oliver
quotes
a
report
of
the
grand
in
the
nineteenth
century
stating
that
during
the
crusades
at
which
masons
were
present
some
masonic
mss
of
great
importance
were
discovered
among
the
descendants
of
the
ancient
jews
and
that
other
valuable
documents
were
found
at
different
periods
down
to
the
year
of
light
at
which
time
a
record
came
to
light
in
syrian
characters
relating
to
the
most
remote
antiquity
and
from
which
it
would
appear
that
the
world
is
many
thousand
years
older
than
given
by
the
mosaic
account
few
of
these
characters
were
translated
till
the
reign
of
our
illustrious
and
most
enlightened
brother
frederick
ii
king
of
prussia
whose
zeal
for
the
craft
was
the
cause
of
so
much
improvement
in
the
society
over
which
he
condescended
to
preside
i
suggest
then
that
the
documents
here
referred
to
and
containing
the
secrets
claimed
by
von
hundt
may
have
been
the
ones
afterwards
published
by
the
du
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
that
if
unauthentic
they
were
the
work
of
voltaire
aided
probably
by
a
jew
capable
of
forging
syriac
manuscripts
that
johnson
was
the
jew
in
question
seems
probable
since
findel
definitely
asserts
that
the
history
of
the
continuation
of
the
order
of
knights
templar
was
his
work
frederick
as
we
know
was
in
the
habit
of
employing
jews
to
carry
out
shady
transactions
and
he
may
well
have
used
johnson
to
forge
documents
as
he
used
ephraim
to
coin
false
money
for
him
it
would
be
further
quite
in
keeping
with
his
policy
to
get
rid
of
the
man
as
soon
as
he
had
served
his
purpose
lest
he
should
betray
his
secrets
at
any
rate
whatever
were
the
methods
employed
by
frederick
the
great
for
obtaining
control
over
masonry
the
fruitful
results
of
that
very
trifling
circumstance
his
initiation
at
brunswick
become
more
and
more
apparent
as
the
century
advances
thus
when
in
the
rite
of
perfection
was
reorganized
and
rechristened
the
ancient
and
accepted
scottish
rite
always
the
same
scottish
cover
for
prussianism
it
is
said
to
have
been
frederick
who
conducted
operations
drew
up
the
new
constitutions
of
the
order
and
rearranged
the
degrees
so
as
to
bring
the
total
number
up
to
as
follows
prince
of
mercy
sovereign
commander
of
the
temple
knight
of
the
sun
grand
scotch
knight
of
andrew
grand
elect
knight
of
kadosch
grand
inspector
inquisitor
commander
sublime
prince
of
the
royal
secret
sovereign
grand
in
the
last
four
degrees
frederick
the
great
and
prussia
play
an
important
part
in
the
thirtieth
degree
of
knight
kadosch
largely
modelled
on
the
vehmgerichts
the
knights
wear
teutonic
crosses
the
throne
is
surmounted
by
the
eagle
of
prussia
and
the
president
who
is
called
thrice
puissant
grand
master
represents
frederick
himself
in
the
degree
of
sublime
prince
of
the
royal
secret
frederick
is
described
as
the
head
of
continental
freemasonry
in
the
degree
of
sovereign
grand
the
jewel
is
again
the
eagle
and
the
sovereign
grand
commander
is
frederick
who
at
the
time
this
degree
was
instituted
figured
with
philippe
duc
grand
master
of
the
grand
orient
as
his
lieutenant
the
most
important
of
these
innovations
was
the
degree
which
was
in
reality
a
system
rather
than
a
degree
for
bringing
together
the
masons
of
all
countries
under
one
head
hence
the
immense
power
acquired
by
frederick
by
french
masonry
was
thus
entirely
prussianized
and
frederick
had
indeed
become
the
idol
of
masonry
everywhere
yet
probably
no
one
ever
despised
freemasonry
more
profoundly
as
the
american
mason
albert
pike
shrewdly
observed
there
is
no
doubt
that
frederick
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
great
pretensions
of
masonry
in
the
blue
degrees
were
merely
imaginary
and
deceptive
he
ridiculed
the
order
and
thought
its
ceremonies
mere
child
play
and
some
of
his
sayings
to
that
effect
have
been
preserved
it
does
not
at
all
follow
that
he
might
not
at
a
later
day
have
found
it
politic
to
put
himself
at
the
head
of
an
order
that
had
become
a
power
it
is
not
without
significance
to
find
that
in
the
year
following
the
official
foundation
of
the
that
is
to
say
in
lord
holdernesse
in
a
letter
to
the
british
ambassador
in
paris
lord
albemarle
headed
very
secret
speaks
of
the
influence
which
the
king
of
prussia
has
of
late
obtained
over
all
the
french
councils
and
a
few
weeks
later
lord
albemarle
refers
to
the
great
influence
of
the
prussian
court
over
the
french
councils
by
which
they
are
so
blinded
as
not
to
be
able
to
judge
for
themselves
but
it
is
time
to
turn
to
another
sphere
of
activity
which
masonry
opened
out
to
the
ambitions
of
frederick
the
making
of
the
which
even
those
writers
the
most
sceptical
with
regard
to
secret
influences
behind
the
revolutionary
movement
admit
to
have
contributed
towards
the
final
cataclysm
is
a
question
on
which
official
history
has
thrown
but
little
light
according
to
the
authorized
version
of
the
story
as
related
for
example
in
lord
morley
work
on
the
encyclopædists
the
plan
of
translating
ephraim
chambers
which
had
appeared
in
was
suggested
to
diderot
some
fifteen
years
later
by
a
french
bookseller
named
le
breton
diderot
fertile
and
energetic
intelligence
transformed
the
scheme
it
was
resolved
to
make
chambers
work
a
mere
for
a
new
enterprise
of
far
wider
scope
we
then
go
on
to
read
of
the
financial
difficulties
that
now
beset
the
publisher
of
the
embarrassment
of
diderot
who
felt
himself
unequal
to
the
task
of
arranging
and
supervising
every
department
of
a
new
book
that
was
to
include
the
whole
circle
of
the
sciences
of
the
fortunate
enlisting
of
as
a
collaborator
and
later
of
men
belonging
to
all
kinds
of
professions
all
united
in
a
work
that
was
as
useful
as
it
was
laborious
without
any
view
of
interest
without
any
common
understanding
and
agreement
further
of
the
cruel
persecutions
encountered
at
the
hands
of
the
jesuits
who
had
expected
at
least
to
have
control
of
the
articles
on
theology
and
finally
of
the
tyrannical
suppression
of
the
great
work
on
account
of
the
tendencies
these
same
articles
displayed
now
for
a
further
light
on
the
matter
in
the
famous
speech
of
the
chevalier
ramsay
already
quoted
which
was
delivered
at
grand
lodge
of
paris
in
the
following
passage
occurs
the
fourth
quality
required
in
our
order
is
the
taste
for
useful
sciences
and
the
liberal
arts
thus
the
order
exacts
of
each
of
you
to
contribute
by
his
protection
liberality
or
labour
to
a
vast
work
for
which
no
academy
can
suffice
because
all
these
societies
being
composed
of
a
very
small
number
of
men
their
work
can
not
embrace
an
object
so
extended
all
the
grand
masters
in
germany
england
italy
and
elsewhere
exhort
all
the
learned
men
and
all
the
artisans
of
the
fraternity
to
unite
to
furnish
the
materials
for
a
universal
dictionary
of
all
the
liberal
arts
and
useful
sciences
excepting
only
theology
and
politics
the
work
has
already
been
commenced
in
london
and
by
means
of
the
unions
of
our
brothers
it
may
be
carried
to
a
conclusion
in
a
few
years
so
after
all
it
was
no
enterprising
bookseller
no
brilliantly
inspired
philosopher
who
conceived
the
idea
of
the
but
a
powerful
international
organization
able
to
employ
the
services
of
more
men
than
all
the
academies
could
supply
which
devised
the
scheme
at
least
six
years
before
the
date
at
which
it
is
said
to
have
occurred
to
diderot
thus
the
whole
story
as
usually
told
to
us
would
appear
to
be
a
complete
fabrication
struggling
publishers
toiling
carrying
out
their
superhuman
task
as
independent
men
of
letters
without
the
patronage
of
the
great
which
lord
morley
points
out
as
one
of
the
most
important
facts
in
the
history
of
the
encyclopædia
writers
of
all
kinds
bound
together
by
no
common
understanding
or
agreement
are
all
seen
in
reality
to
have
been
closely
associated
as
artisans
of
the
fraternity
carrying
out
the
orders
of
their
superiors
the
was
therefore
essentially
a
masonic
publication
and
papus
whilst
erroneously
attributing
the
famous
oration
and
consequently
the
plan
of
the
to
the
inspiration
of
the
duc
emphasizes
the
importance
of
this
fact
thus
he
writes
the
revolution
manifests
itself
by
two
stages
by
the
publication
of
the
due
to
french
freemasonry
under
the
high
inspiration
of
the
duc
in
the
lodges
due
in
great
part
to
the
members
of
the
templar
rite
and
executed
by
a
group
of
expelled
freemasons
afterwards
amnestied
the
masonic
authorship
of
the
and
the
consequent
dissemination
of
revolutionary
doctrines
has
remained
no
matter
of
doubt
to
the
freemasons
of
france
on
the
contrary
they
glory
in
the
fact
at
the
congress
of
the
grand
orient
in
the
freemason
bonnet
declared
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
glorious
line
of
encyclopædists
formed
in
our
temples
a
fervent
audience
which
was
then
alone
in
invoking
the
radiant
device
as
yet
unknown
to
the
crowd
liberty
equality
fraternity
the
revolutionary
seed
quickly
germinated
amidst
this
our
illustrious
freemasons
diderot
helvétius
voltaire
condorcet
completed
the
evolution
of
minds
and
prepared
the
new
era
and
when
the
bastille
fell
freemasonry
had
the
supreme
honour
of
giving
to
humanity
the
charter
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
which
it
had
elaborated
with
devotion
this
charter
the
orator
went
on
to
say
was
the
work
of
the
freemason
lafayette
and
was
adopted
by
the
constituent
assembly
of
which
more
than
members
were
freemasons
but
in
using
the
lodges
to
sow
the
seeds
of
revolution
the
encyclopædists
betrayed
not
only
the
cause
of
monarchy
but
of
masonry
as
well
it
will
be
noticed
that
in
conformity
with
true
masonic
principles
ramsay
in
his
oration
expressly
stated
that
the
encyclopædia
was
to
concern
itself
with
the
liberal
arts
and
sciences
and
that
theology
and
politics
were
to
be
excluded
from
the
contemplated
scheme
how
then
did
it
come
to
pass
that
these
were
eventually
the
two
subjects
to
which
the
encyclopædists
devoted
the
greatest
attention
so
that
their
work
became
principally
an
attack
on
church
and
monarchy
if
papus
was
right
in
attributing
this
revolutionary
tendency
to
the
from
the
time
of
the
famous
oration
then
ramsay
could
only
be
set
down
as
the
profoundest
hypocrite
or
as
the
mouthpiece
of
hypocrites
professing
intentions
the
very
reverse
of
their
real
designs
a
far
more
probable
explanation
seems
to
be
that
during
the
interval
between
ramsay
speech
and
the
date
when
the
was
begun
in
earnest
the
scheme
underwent
a
change
it
will
be
noticed
that
the
year
of
when
diderot
and
are
said
to
have
embarked
on
their
task
coincided
with
the
decadence
of
french
freemasonry
under
the
comte
de
clermont
and
the
invasion
of
the
lodges
by
the
subversive
elements
thus
the
project
propounded
with
the
best
intentions
by
the
freemasons
of
was
filched
by
their
revolutionary
successors
and
turned
to
a
diametrically
opposite
purpose
but
it
is
not
to
the
lacorne
and
his
following
that
we
can
attribute
the
efficiency
with
which
not
only
the
but
a
host
of
minor
revolutionary
publications
were
circulated
all
over
france
frederick
the
great
had
seen
his
opportunity
if
i
am
right
in
my
surmise
that
ramsay
speech
had
reached
the
ears
of
frederick
the
prospect
of
the
contained
therein
may
well
have
appeared
to
him
a
magnificent
method
for
obtaining
a
footing
in
the
intellectual
circles
of
france
hence
then
doubtless
an
additional
reason
for
his
hasty
initiation
into
masonry
his
summons
to
voltaire
and
his
subsequent
overtures
to
diderot
and
who
by
the
time
the
first
volume
of
the
appeared
in
had
both
been
made
members
of
the
royal
academy
of
prussia
in
the
following
year
frederick
offered
the
presidency
of
the
academy
in
place
of
maupertuis
an
offer
which
was
refused
but
in
and
again
in
visited
frederick
in
germany
and
received
his
pension
regularly
from
berlin
it
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
when
the
had
reached
the
letter
p
it
included
in
an
unsigned
article
on
prussia
a
panegyric
on
the
virtues
and
the
talents
of
the
illustrious
monarch
who
presided
over
the
destinies
of
that
favoured
country
the
art
of
frederick
the
great
as
of
his
successors
on
the
throne
of
the
hohenzollerns
was
to
make
use
of
every
movement
that
could
further
the
design
of
prussian
supremacy
he
used
the
freemasons
as
he
used
the
philosophers
and
as
he
used
the
jews
to
carry
out
his
great
scheme
the
destruction
of
the
french
monarchy
and
of
the
alliance
between
france
and
austria
whilst
through
his
representatives
at
the
court
of
france
he
was
able
to
create
discord
between
versailles
and
vienna
and
bring
discredit
on
marie
antoinette
through
his
allies
in
the
masonic
lodges
and
in
the
secret
societies
he
was
able
to
reach
the
people
of
france
the
gold
and
the
printing
presses
of
frederick
the
great
were
added
to
those
of
the
orléanistes
for
the
circulation
of
seditious
literature
throughout
the
provinces
so
as
the
century
advanced
the
association
founded
by
royalists
and
catholics
was
turned
into
an
engine
of
destruction
by
revolutionary
intriguers
the
rites
and
symbols
were
gradually
perverted
to
an
end
directly
opposed
to
that
for
which
they
had
been
instituted
and
the
two
degrees
of
and
knight
kadosch
came
to
symbolize
respectively
war
on
religion
and
war
on
the
monarchy
of
france
it
is
no
orthodox
catholic
but
an
occultist
and
rosicrucian
who
thus
describes
the
rôle
of
masonry
in
the
revolution
masonry
has
not
only
been
profaned
but
it
has
been
served
as
a
cover
and
pretext
for
the
plots
of
anarchy
by
the
occult
influence
of
the
avengers
of
jacques
du
molay
and
the
continuers
of
the
schismatic
work
of
the
temple
instead
of
avenging
the
death
of
hiram
they
have
avenged
his
assassins
the
anarchists
have
taken
the
the
square
and
the
mallet
and
have
written
on
them
liberty
equality
fraternity
that
is
to
say
liberty
for
envyings
equality
in
degradation
fraternity
for
destruction
those
are
the
men
whom
the
church
has
justly
condemned
and
that
she
will
always
condemn
but
it
is
time
to
turn
to
another
masonic
power
which
meanwhile
had
entered
the
lists
the
martinistes
or
french
illuminés
french
illuminism
whilst
frederick
the
great
the
freemasons
the
encyclopædists
and
the
orléanistes
were
working
on
the
material
plane
to
undermine
the
church
and
monarchy
in
france
another
cult
had
arisen
which
by
the
middle
of
the
century
succeeded
in
insinuating
itself
into
the
lodges
this
was
a
recrudescence
of
the
old
craze
for
occultism
which
now
spread
like
wildfire
all
over
europe
from
bordeaux
to
petersburg
during
the
reign
of
anna
of
courland
the
russian
court
was
permeated
with
superstition
and
professional
magicians
and
charlatans
of
every
kind
were
encouraged
the
upper
classes
of
germany
in
the
eighteenth
century
proved
equally
susceptible
to
the
attractions
of
the
supernatural
and
princes
desirous
of
long
life
or
greater
power
eagerly
pursued
the
quest
of
the
philosopher
stone
the
elixir
of
life
and
evoked
spirits
under
the
direction
of
occultists
in
their
service
in
france
occultism
reduced
to
a
system
adopted
the
outer
forms
of
masonry
as
a
cover
to
the
propagation
of
its
doctrines
it
was
in
that
martines
de
pasqually
or
paschalis
a
mason
founded
his
order
of
élus
cohens
elected
priests
known
later
as
the
or
the
french
although
brought
up
in
the
christian
faith
pasqually
has
been
frequently
described
as
a
jew
the
baron
de
gleichen
himself
a
martiniste
and
a
member
of
the
amis
réunis
throws
an
interesting
light
on
the
matter
in
this
passage
pasqualis
was
originally
spanish
perhaps
of
the
jewish
race
since
his
disciples
inherited
from
him
a
large
number
of
jewish
manuscripts
it
was
this
cabalistic
sect
the
martinistes
which
now
became
the
third
great
masonic
power
in
france
the
rite
of
the
martinistes
was
broadly
divided
into
two
classes
in
the
first
of
which
was
represented
the
fall
of
man
and
in
the
second
his
final
restoration
a
further
variation
on
the
masonic
theme
of
a
loss
and
a
recovery
after
the
first
three
craft
degrees
came
the
cohen
degrees
of
the
same
apprentice
cohen
fellow
craft
cohen
and
master
cohen
then
those
of
grand
architect
grand
elect
of
zerubbabel
or
knight
of
the
east
but
above
these
were
concealed
degrees
leading
up
to
the
which
formed
the
capstone
of
the
edifice
pasqually
first
established
his
rite
at
marseilles
toulouse
and
bordeaux
then
in
paris
and
before
long
martiniste
lodges
spread
all
over
france
with
the
centre
at
lyons
under
the
direction
of
willermoz
a
prosperous
merchant
living
there
from
this
moment
other
occult
orders
sprang
up
in
all
directions
in
dom
pernetti
founded
his
sect
of
illuminés
in
that
city
declaring
himself
a
high
initiate
of
freemasonry
and
teaching
the
doctrines
of
swedenborg
later
a
certain
chastanier
founded
the
illuminés
théosophes
a
modified
version
of
pernetti
rite
and
in
the
marquis
de
thomé
started
a
purified
variety
of
swedenborgianism
under
the
name
of
rite
of
swedenborg
beneath
all
these
occult
sects
one
common
source
of
inspiration
is
to
be
found
the
perverted
and
magical
cabala
of
the
jews
that
conglomeration
of
wild
theosophical
imaginings
and
barbaric
superstitions
founded
on
ancient
pagan
cults
and
added
to
throughout
seventeen
centuries
by
succeeding
generations
of
jewish
occultists
this
influence
is
particularly
to
be
detected
in
the
various
forms
of
the
degree
which
in
nearly
all
these
associations
forms
the
highest
and
most
secret
degree
the
ritual
of
the
eminent
order
of
the
knights
of
the
black
eagle
or
sovereigns
of
the
a
secret
and
unpublished
document
of
the
eighteenth
century
which
differs
entirely
from
the
published
rituals
explains
that
no
one
can
attain
to
knowledge
of
the
higher
sciences
without
the
clavicules
de
salomon
of
which
the
real
secrets
were
never
committed
to
print
and
which
is
said
to
contain
the
whole
of
cabalistic
science
the
catechism
of
this
same
degree
deals
mainly
with
the
transmutation
of
metals
the
stone
etc
in
the
rite
of
perfection
as
worked
in
france
and
america
this
cabalistic
influence
is
shown
in
those
degrees
known
under
the
name
of
the
ineffable
degrees
derived
from
the
jewish
belief
in
the
mystery
that
surrounds
the
ineflable
name
of
god
according
to
the
custom
of
the
jews
the
sacred
name
jehovah
or
composed
of
the
four
letters
yod
he
vau
he
which
formed
the
tetragrammaton
was
never
to
be
pronounced
by
the
profane
who
were
obliged
to
substitute
for
it
the
word
adonai
the
tetragrammaton
might
only
be
uttered
once
a
year
on
the
day
of
atonement
by
the
high
priest
in
the
holy
of
holies
amid
the
sound
of
trumpets
and
cymbals
which
prevented
the
people
from
hearing
it
it
is
said
that
in
consequence
of
the
people
thus
refraining
from
its
utterance
the
true
pronunciation
of
the
name
was
at
last
lost
the
jews
further
believed
that
the
tetragrammaton
was
possessed
of
unbounded
powers
he
who
pronounces
it
shakes
heaven
and
earth
and
inspires
the
very
angels
with
astonishment
and
terror
the
ineffable
name
thus
conferred
miraculous
gifts
it
was
engraved
on
the
rod
of
moses
and
enabled
him
to
perform
wonders
just
as
according
to
the
toledot
yeshu
it
conferred
the
same
powers
on
christ
this
superstition
was
clearly
a
part
of
rosicrucian
tradition
for
the
symbol
of
the
tetragrammaton
within
a
triangle
adopted
by
the
masonic
lodges
figures
in
fludd
cabalistic
system
in
the
ineffable
degrees
it
was
invested
with
all
the
mystic
awe
by
which
it
is
surrounded
in
jewish
theology
and
according
to
early
american
working
brothers
and
companions
of
these
degrees
received
the
name
of
god
as
it
was
revealed
to
enoch
and
were
sworn
to
pronounce
it
but
once
in
their
lives
in
the
alchemical
version
of
the
degree
referred
to
above
the
ineffable
name
is
actually
invested
with
magical
powers
as
in
the
jewish
cabala
ragon
after
describing
the
jewish
ceremony
when
the
word
jehovah
was
pronounced
by
the
high
priest
in
the
holy
of
holies
goes
on
to
say
that
another
term
for
the
tetragrammaton
forms
the
sacred
word
of
a
scotch
degree
and
that
this
belief
in
its
mystic
properties
will
be
found
at
the
head
of
the
instructions
for
the
third
degree
of
the
knight
of
the
black
eagle
called
thus
q
what
is
the
most
powerful
name
of
god
on
the
pentaculum
adonai
q
what
is
its
power
a
to
move
the
universe
that
one
of
the
knights
who
had
the
good
fortune
to
pronounce
it
cabalistically
would
have
at
his
disposal
the
powers
that
inhabit
the
four
elements
and
the
celestial
spirits
and
would
possess
all
the
virtues
possible
to
man
that
this
form
of
the
was
of
purely
jewish
origin
is
thus
clearly
evident
in
the
address
to
the
candidate
for
initiation
into
the
degree
at
the
lodge
of
the
contrat
social
it
is
stated
this
degree
which
includes
an
order
of
perfect
masons
was
brought
to
light
by
brother
who
took
it
from
the
kabbalistic
treasure
of
the
doctor
and
rabbi
néamuth
chief
of
the
synagogue
of
leyden
in
holland
who
had
preserved
its
precious
secrets
and
its
costume
both
of
which
we
shall
see
in
the
same
order
in
which
he
placed
them
in
his
mysterious
talmud
now
we
know
that
in
the
eighteenth
century
a
society
of
rosicrucian
magicians
had
been
instituted
in
florence
which
was
believed
to
date
back
to
the
fifteenth
century
and
to
have
been
partly
if
not
wholly
composed
of
orientals
as
we
shall
see
in
the
next
chapter
but
it
seems
probable
that
this
sect
whilst
secretly
inspiring
the
masons
was
itself
either
nameless
or
concealed
under
a
disguise
thus
in
an
english
freemason
writes
i
have
found
some
rather
curious
mss
in
algiers
in
hebrew
relating
to
the
society
of
the
rosicrucians
which
exists
at
present
under
another
name
with
the
same
forms
i
hope
moreover
to
be
admitted
to
their
knowledge
it
has
frequently
been
argued
that
jews
can
have
played
no
part
in
freemasonry
at
this
period
since
they
themselves
were
not
admitted
to
the
lodges
but
this
is
by
no
means
certain
in
the
article
from
gentleman
already
quoted
it
is
stated
that
jews
are
admitted
de
luchet
further
quotes
the
instance
of
david
moses
hertz
received
in
a
london
lodge
in
and
the
author
of
published
in
states
that
he
has
seen
three
jews
received
into
a
lodge
at
amsterdam
in
the
melchisedeck
lodges
of
the
continent
were
openly
admitted
and
here
again
the
degree
occupies
the
most
important
place
the
highest
degrees
of
this
rite
were
the
initiated
brothers
of
asia
the
masters
of
the
wise
and
the
royal
priests
otherwise
known
as
the
degree
of
melchisedeck
or
the
true
brothers
of
the
this
order
usually
described
as
the
of
which
the
centre
was
in
vienna
and
the
leader
a
certain
baron
von
eckhoffen
is
said
to
have
been
a
continuation
of
the
brothers
of
the
golden
and
rosy
cross
a
revival
of
the
rosicrucians
organized
in
by
a
saxon
priest
samuel
richter
known
as
sincerus
renatus
the
real
origins
of
the
asiatic
brethren
are
however
obscure
and
little
literature
on
the
subject
is
to
be
found
in
this
country
their
further
title
of
the
knights
and
brethren
of
john
the
evangelist
suggests
johannite
inspiration
and
was
clearly
an
imposture
since
they
included
jews
turks
persians
and
armenians
de
luchet
who
as
a
contemporary
was
in
a
position
to
acquire
information
thus
describes
the
organization
of
the
order
which
it
will
be
seen
was
entirely
judaic
the
superior
direction
is
called
the
small
and
constant
sanhedrim
of
europe
the
names
of
those
employed
by
which
they
conceal
themselves
from
their
inferiors
are
hebrew
the
signs
of
the
third
principal
degree
the
are
urim
and
thummim
the
order
has
the
true
secrets
and
the
explanations
moral
and
physical
of
the
hierogyphics
of
the
very
venerable
order
of
freemasonry
the
initiate
had
to
swear
absolute
submission
and
unswerving
obedience
to
the
laws
of
the
order
and
to
follow
its
laws
implicitly
to
the
end
of
his
life
without
asking
by
whom
they
were
given
or
whence
they
came
who
asks
de
luchet
gave
to
the
order
these
secrets
that
is
the
great
and
insidious
question
for
the
secret
societies
but
the
initiate
who
remains
and
must
remain
eternally
in
the
order
never
finds
this
out
he
dare
not
even
ask
it
he
must
promise
never
to
ask
it
in
this
way
those
who
participate
in
the
secrets
of
the
order
remain
the
masters
again
as
in
the
the
same
system
of
concealed
superiors
the
same
blind
obedience
to
unknown
directors
under
the
guidance
of
these
various
sects
of
illuminés
a
wave
of
occultism
swept
over
france
and
lodges
everywhere
became
centres
of
instruction
on
the
cabala
magic
divination
alchemy
and
theosophy
masonic
rites
degenerated
into
ceremonies
for
the
evocation
of
spirits
women
who
were
now
admitted
to
these
assemblies
screamed
fainted
fell
into
convulsions
and
lent
themselves
to
experiments
of
the
most
horrible
kind
by
means
of
these
occult
practices
the
in
time
became
the
third
great
masonic
power
in
france
and
the
rival
orders
perceived
the
expediency
of
joining
forces
accordingly
in
an
amalgamation
of
all
the
masonic
groups
was
effected
at
the
new
lodge
of
the
the
founder
of
this
lodge
was
savalette
de
langes
keeper
of
the
royal
treasury
grand
officer
of
the
grand
orient
and
a
high
initiate
of
masonry
versed
in
all
mysteries
in
all
the
lodges
and
in
all
the
plots
in
order
to
unite
them
he
made
his
lodge
a
mixture
of
all
sophistic
martiniste
and
masonic
systems
and
as
a
bait
to
the
aristocracy
organized
balls
and
concerts
at
which
the
adepts
male
and
female
danced
and
feasted
or
sang
of
the
beauties
of
their
liberty
and
equality
little
knowing
that
above
them
was
a
secret
committee
which
was
arranging
to
extend
this
equality
beyond
the
lodge
to
rank
and
fortune
to
castles
and
to
cottages
to
marquesses
and
bourgeois
alike
a
further
development
of
the
amis
réunis
was
the
rite
of
the
compounded
by
savalette
de
langes
in
out
of
swedenborgian
martiniste
and
rosicrucian
mysteries
into
which
the
higher
initiates
of
the
amis
réunis
court
de
gebelin
the
prince
de
hesse
condorcet
the
vicomte
de
tavannes
willermoz
and
others
were
initiated
a
modified
form
of
this
rite
was
instituted
at
narbonne
in
under
the
name
of
free
and
accepted
masons
du
rit
primitif
the
english
nomenclature
being
adopted
according
to
clavel
in
order
to
make
it
appear
that
the
rite
emanated
from
england
in
reality
its
founder
the
marquis
de
chefdebien
a
member
of
the
grand
orient
and
of
the
amis
réunis
drew
his
inspiration
from
certain
german
freemasons
with
whom
he
maintained
throughout
close
relations
and
who
were
presumably
members
of
the
stricte
observance
since
chefdebien
was
a
member
of
this
order
in
which
he
bore
the
title
of
eques
a
capite
galeato
the
correspondence
that
passed
between
chefdebien
and
salvalette
de
langes
recently
discovered
and
published
in
france
is
one
of
the
most
illuminating
records
of
the
masonic
ramifications
in
existence
before
the
revolution
ever
brought
to
light
to
judge
by
the
tone
of
these
letters
the
leaders
of
the
rit
primitif
would
appear
to
have
been
and
loyal
gentlemen
devoted
to
the
catholic
religion
yet
in
their
passion
for
new
forms
of
masonry
and
thirst
for
occult
lore
ready
to
associate
themselves
with
every
kind
of
adventurer
and
charlatan
who
might
be
able
to
initiate
them
into
further
mysteries
in
the
curious
notes
drawn
up
by
savalette
for
the
guidance
of
the
marquis
de
chefdebien
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
power
behind
the
philosophers
of
the
and
the
aristocratic
adepts
of
the
lodges
the
professional
magicians
and
men
of
mystery
and
behind
these
again
the
concealed
directors
of
the
secret
societies
the
the
magicians
the
part
played
by
magicians
during
the
period
preceding
the
french
revolution
is
of
course
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
and
has
never
been
disputed
by
official
history
but
like
the
schools
of
philosophers
this
sudden
crop
of
magicians
is
always
represented
as
a
sporadic
growth
called
into
being
by
the
idle
and
curious
society
of
the
day
the
important
point
to
realize
is
that
just
as
the
philosophers
were
all
freemasons
the
principal
magicians
were
not
only
freemasons
but
members
of
occult
secret
societies
it
is
therefore
not
as
isolated
charlatans
but
as
agents
of
some
hidden
power
that
we
must
regard
the
men
whom
we
will
now
pass
in
a
rapid
survey
one
of
the
first
to
appear
in
the
field
was
schroepfer
a
keeper
of
leipzig
who
declared
that
no
one
could
be
a
true
freemason
without
practising
magic
accordingly
he
proclaimed
himself
the
reformer
of
freemasonry
and
set
up
a
lodge
in
his
own
house
with
a
rite
based
on
the
degree
for
the
purpose
of
evoking
spirits
the
meetings
took
place
at
dead
of
night
when
by
means
of
carefully
arranged
lights
magic
mirrors
and
possibly
of
electricity
schroepfer
contrived
to
produce
apparitions
which
his
disciples
under
the
influence
of
strong
punch
took
to
be
visitors
from
the
other
world
in
the
end
schroepfer
driven
crazy
by
his
own
incantations
blew
out
his
brains
in
a
garden
near
leipzig
according
to
lecouteulx
de
canteleu
it
was
schroepfer
who
indoctrinated
the
famous
comte
de
the
master
of
our
modern
lodges
the
identity
of
this
mysterious
personage
has
never
been
established
by
some
contemporaries
he
was
said
to
be
a
natural
son
of
the
king
of
portugal
by
others
the
son
of
a
jew
and
a
polish
princess
the
duc
de
choiseul
on
being
asked
whether
he
knew
the
origin
of
replied
no
doubt
we
know
it
he
is
the
son
of
a
portuguese
jew
who
exploits
the
credulity
of
the
town
and
court
in
a
rumour
went
round
that
his
father
was
a
jew
of
bordeaux
but
according
to
the
of
the
marquise
de
the
baron
de
breteuil
discovered
from
the
archives
of
his
ministry
that
the
pretended
comte
de
was
the
son
of
a
jewish
doctor
of
strasburg
that
his
real
name
was
daniel
wolf
and
that
he
was
born
in
the
general
opinion
thus
appears
to
have
been
in
favour
of
his
jewish
ancestry
seems
first
to
have
been
heard
of
in
germany
about
where
his
marvellous
powers
attracted
the
attention
of
the
maréchal
de
who
always
the
ready
dupe
of
charlatans
brought
him
back
with
him
to
the
court
of
france
where
he
speedily
gained
the
favour
of
madame
de
pompadour
the
marquise
before
long
presented
him
to
the
king
who
granted
him
an
apartment
at
chambord
and
enchanted
by
his
brilliant
wit
frequently
spent
long
evenings
in
conversation
with
him
in
the
rooms
of
madame
de
pompadour
meanwhile
his
invention
of
boats
for
the
invasion
of
england
raised
him
still
higher
in
the
estimation
of
the
maréchal
de
in
we
hear
of
him
as
living
in
great
splendour
in
holland
and
giving
out
that
he
had
reached
the
age
of
though
appearing
to
be
only
fifty
if
this
were
so
he
must
have
been
at
the
time
of
his
death
in
at
schleswig
but
this
feat
of
longevity
is
far
from
satisfying
his
modern
admirers
who
declare
that
did
not
die
in
but
is
still
alive
in
some
corner
of
eastern
europe
this
is
in
accordance
with
the
theory
said
to
have
been
circulated
by
himself
that
by
the
eighteenth
century
he
had
passed
through
several
incarnations
and
that
the
last
one
had
continued
for
years
barruel
however
explains
that
in
thus
referring
to
his
age
spoke
in
masonic
language
in
which
a
man
who
has
taken
the
first
degree
is
said
to
be
three
years
old
after
the
second
five
or
the
third
seven
so
that
by
means
of
the
huge
increase
the
higher
degrees
conferred
it
might
be
quite
possible
for
an
exalted
adept
to
attain
the
age
of
has
been
represented
by
modern
writers
not
only
those
who
compose
his
following
as
a
person
of
extraordinary
attainments
a
sort
of
towering
over
the
minor
magicians
of
his
day
contemporaries
however
take
him
less
seriously
and
represent
him
rather
as
an
expert
charlatan
whom
the
wits
of
the
made
the
butt
of
pleasantries
his
principal
importance
to
the
subject
of
this
book
consists
however
in
his
influence
on
the
secret
societies
according
to
the
authentiques

the
grand
master
of
freemasonry
and
it
was
he
who
initiated
cagliostro
into
the
mysteries
of
egyptian
masonry
joseph
balsamo
born
in
who
assumed
the
name
of
comte
de
cagliostro
as
a
magician
far
eclipsed
his
master
like
he
was
generally
reputed
to
be
a
jew
the
son
of
pietro
balsamo
a
sicilian
tradesman
of
jewish
origin
and
he
made
no
secret
of
his
arden
admiration
for
the
jewish
race
after
the
death
of
his
parents
he
escaped
from
the
monastery
in
which
he
had
been
placed
at
palermo
and
joined
himself
to
a
man
known
as
altotas
said
to
have
been
an
armenian
with
whom
he
travelled
to
greece
and
egypt
cagliostro
travels
later
took
him
to
poland
and
germany
where
he
was
initiated
into
freemasonry
and
finally
to
france
but
it
was
in
england
that
he
himself
declared
that
he
elaborated
his
famous
egyptian
rite
which
he
founded
officially
in
according
to
his
own
account
this
rite
was
derived
from
a
manuscript
by
a
certain
george
cofton
whose
identity
has
never
been
discovered
which
he
bought
by
chance
in
london
yarker
however
expresses
the
opinion
that
the
rite
of
cagliostro
was
clearly
that
of
pasqually
and
that
if
he
acquired
it
from
a
manuscript
in
london
it
would
indicate
that
pasquilly
had
disciples
in
that
city
a
far
more
probable
explanation
is
that
cagliostro
derived
his
egyptian
masonry
from
the
same
source
as
that
on
which
pasqually
had
drawn
for
his
order
of
martinistes
namely
the
cabala
and
that
it
was
not
from
a
single
manuscript
but
from
an
eminent
jewish
cabalist
in
london
that
he
took
his
instructions
who
this
may
have
been
we
shall
soon
see
at
any
rate
in
a
contemporary
account
of
cagliostro
we
find
him
described
as
a
doctor
initiated
into
cabalistic
art
and
a
but
after
founding
his
own
rite
he
acquired
the
name
of
grand
copht
that
is
to
say
supreme
head
of
egyptian
masonry
a
new
branch
that
he
wished
to
graft
on
to
old
european
freemasonry
we
shall
return
to
his
further
masonic
adventures
later
in
a
superior
category
to
and
cagliostro
was
the
famous
swabian
doctor
mesmer
who
has
given
his
name
to
an
important
branch
of
natural
science
in
about
mesmer
announced
his
great
discovery
of
animal
magnetism
the
principle
of
life
in
all
organized
beings
the
soul
of
all
that
breathes
but
if
mesmerism
has
come
to
be
regarded
as
almost
synonymous
with
hypnotism
and
in
no
way
a
branch
of
occultism
mesmer
himself
stirring
the
fluid
in
his
magic
bucket
around
which
his
disciples
wept
slept
fell
into
trances
or
convulsions
raved
or
prophesied
earned
not
unnaturally
the
reputation
of
a
charlatan
the
freemasons
eager
to
discover
the
secret
of
the
magic
bucket
hastened
to
enrol
him
in
their
order
and
mesmer
was
received
into
the
primitive
rite
of
free
and
accepted
masons
in
space
forbids
a
description
of
the
minor
magicians
who
flourished
at
this
period
of
founder
in
of
a
chapter
of
true
and
ancient
masons
practising
certain
magical
theosophical
and
alchemical
degrees
of
worker
of
miracles
in
the
neighbourhood
of
ratisbonne
of
the
jew
leon
one
of
a
band
of
charlatans
who
made
large
sums
of
money
with
magic
mirrors
in
which
the
imaginative
were
able
to
see
their
absent
friends
and
who
was
finally
banished
from
france
by
the
police
all
these
and
many
others
exploited
the
credulity
and
curiosity
of
the
upper
classes
both
in
france
and
germany
between
the
years
of
and
de
luchet
writing
before
the
french
revolution
describes
the
part
played
in
their
mysteries
by
the
soul
of
a
cabalistic
jew
named
gablidone
who
had
lived
before
christ
and
who
predicted
that
in
the
year
there
will
be
on
our
globe
a
very
remarkable
revolution
and
there
will
be
no
other
religion
but
that
of
the
patriarchs
how
are
we
to
account
for
this
extraordinary
wave
of
cabalism
in
western
europe
by
whom
was
it
inspired
if
as
jewish
writers
assure
us
neither
marlines
pasqually
cagliostro
nor
any
of
the
visible
occultists
or
magicians
were
jews
the
problem
only
becomes
the
more
insoluble
we
can
not
believe
that
sanhedrims
hebrew
hieroglyphics
the
contemplation
of
the
tetragrammaton
and
other
cabalistic
rites
originated
in
the
brains
of
french
and
german
aristocrats
philosophers
and
freemasons
let
us
turn
then
to
events
taking
place
at
this
moment
in
the
world
of
jewry
and
see
whether
these
may
provide
some
clue
the
jewish
cabalists
it
has
been
shown
in
the
preceding
chapters
that
the
jewish
cabala
played
an
important
part
in
the
occult
and
sects
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
christian
era
the
time
has
now
come
to
enquire
what
part
jewish
influence
played
meanwhile
in
revolutions
merely
to
ask
the
question
is
to
bring
on
oneself
the
accusation
of
yet
the
jewish
writer
bernard
lazare
has
shown
the
falseness
of
this
charge
this
he
writes
is
what
must
separate
the
impartial
historian
from
the
says
the
jew
is
the
preparer
the
machinator
the
chief
engineer
of
revolutions
the
impartial
historian
confines
himself
to
studying
the
part
which
the
jew
considering
his
spirit
his
character
the
nature
of
his
philosophy
and
his
religion
may
have
taken
in
revolutionary
processes
and
movements
lazare
himself
expresses
the
opinion
however
that
the
complaint
of
the
seems
to
be
founded
the
jew
has
the
revolutionary
spirit
consciously
or
not
he
is
an
agent
of
revolution
yet
the
complaint
complicates
itself
for
accuses
the
jews
of
being
the
cause
of
revolutions
let
us
examine
what
this
accusation
is
worth
in
the
light
of
our
present
knowledge
it
would
certainly
be
absurd
to
ascribe
to
the
jews
the
authorship
of
the
conspiracy
of
catiline
or
of
the
gracchi
the
rising
of
jack
straw
and
wat
tyler
jack
rebellion
the
of
france
or
the
peasants
wars
in
germany
although
historical
research
may
lead
in
time
to
the
discovery
of
certain
occult
influences
not
necessarily
jewish
behind
the
european
insurrections
here
referred
to
moreover
apart
from
grievances
or
other
causes
of
rebellion
the
revolutionary
spirit
has
always
existed
independently
of
the
jews
in
all
times
and
in
all
countries
there
have
been
men
born
to
make
trouble
as
the
sparks
fly
upward
nevertheless
in
modern
revolutions
the
part
played
by
the
jews
can
not
be
ignored
and
the
influence
they
have
exercised
will
be
seen
on
examination
to
have
been
twofold
financial
and
occult
throughout
the
middle
ages
it
is
as
sorcerers
and
usurers
that
they
incur
the
reproaches
of
the
christian
world
and
it
is
still
in
the
same
role
under
the
more
modern
terms
of
magicians
and
that
we
detect
their
presence
behind
the
scenes
of
revolution
from
the
seventeenth
century
onward
wherever
money
was
to
be
made
out
of
social
or
political
upheavals
wealthy
jews
have
been
found
to
back
the
winning
side
and
wherever
the
christian
races
have
turned
against
their
own
institutions
jewish
rabbis
philosophers
professors
and
occultists
have
lent
them
their
support
it
was
not
then
necessarily
that
jews
created
these
movements
but
they
knew
how
to
make
use
of
them
for
their
own
ends
it
is
thus
that
in
the
great
rebellion
we
find
them
not
amongst
the
ironsides
of
cromwell
or
the
members
of
his
state
council
but
furnishing
money
and
information
to
the
insurgents
acting
as
army
contractors
and
or
to
use
the
more
euphonious
term
of
lucien
wolf
as
political
intelligencers
of
extraordinary
efficiency
thus
lucien
wolf
in
referring
to
carvajal
the
great
jew
of
the
commonwealth
explains
that
the
wide
ramifications
of
his
commercial
transactions
and
his
relations
with
other
all
over
the
world
placed
him
in
an
unrivalled
position
to
obtain
news
of
the
enemies
of
the
commonwealth
it
is
obvious
that
a
secret
service
of
this
kind
rendered
the
jews
a
formidable
hidden
power
the
more
so
since
their
very
existence
was
frequently
unknown
to
the
rest
of
the
population
around
them
this
precaution
was
necessary
because
jews
were
not
supposed
to
exist
at
that
date
in
england
in
edward
i
had
expelled
them
all
and
for
three
and
a
half
centuries
they
had
remained
in
exile
the
or
marranos
who
had
come
over
from
spain
contrived
however
to
remain
in
the
country
by
skilfully
taking
the
colour
of
their
surroundings
wolf
goes
on
to
observe
that
jewish
services
were
regularly
held
in
the
secret
synagogue
but
in
public
carvajal
and
his
friends
followed
the
practice
of
the
secret
jews
in
spain
and
portugal
passing
as
roman
catholics
and
regularly
attending
mass
in
the
spanish
chapel
but
when
war
between
england
and
spain
rendered
this
expedient
inadvisable
the
marranos
threw
off
the
disguise
of
christianity
and
proclaimed
themselves
followers
of
the
jewish
faith
now
just
at
this
period
the
messianic
era
was
generally
believed
by
the
jews
to
be
approaching
and
it
appears
to
have
occurred
to
them
that
cromwell
might
be
fitted
to
the
part
consequently
emissaries
were
despatched
to
search
the
archives
of
cambridge
in
order
to
discover
whether
the
protector
could
possibly
be
of
jewish
descent
this
quest
proving
fruitless
the
cabalist
rabbi
of
amsterdam
manasseh
ben
israel
addressed
a
petition
to
cromwell
for
the
readmission
of
the
jews
to
england
in
which
he
adroitly
insisted
on
the
retribution
that
overtakes
those
who
afflict
the
people
of
israel
and
the
rewards
that
await
those
who
cherish
them
these
arguments
were
not
without
effect
on
cromwell
who
entertained
the
same
superstition
and
although
he
is
said
to
have
declined
the
jews
offer
to
buy
paul
cathedral
and
the
bodleian
library
because
he
considered
the
they
offered
inadequate
he
exerted
every
effort
to
obtain
their
readmission
to
the
country
in
this
he
encountered
violent
opposition
and
it
seems
that
jews
were
not
permitted
to
return
in
large
numbers
or
at
any
rate
to
enjoy
full
rights
and
privileges
until
after
the
accession
of
charles
ii
who
in
his
turn
had
enlisted
their
financial
aid
later
in
the
jews
of
amsterdam
helped
with
their
credit
the
expedition
of
william
of
orange
against
james
ii
the
former
in
return
brought
many
jews
with
him
to
england
so
a
jewish
writer
is
able
to
boast
that
a
monarch
reigned
who
was
indebted
to
hebrew
gold
for
his
royal
diadem
in
all
this
it
is
impossible
to
follow
any
consecutive
political
plan
the
rôle
of
the
jews
seems
to
have
been
to
support
no
cause
consistently
but
to
obtain
a
footing
in
every
camp
to
back
any
venture
that
offered
a
chance
of
profit
yet
mingled
with
these
material
designs
were
still
their
ancient
messianic
dreams
it
is
curious
to
note
that
the
same
messianic
idea
pervaded
the
levellers
the
rebels
of
the
commonwealth
such
phrases
as
let
israel
go
free
israel
restoration
is
now
beginning
recur
frequently
in
the
literature
of
the
sect
gerard
winstanley
one
of
the
two
principal
leaders
addressed
an
epistle
to
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
that
are
circumcised
in
heart
and
scattered
through
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
and
promised
them
david
their
king
that
they
have
been
waiting
for
the
other
leader
of
the
movement
by
name
everard
in
fact
declared
when
summoned
before
the
lord
fairfax
at
whitehall
that
he
was
of
the
race
of
the
jews
it
is
true
that
the
levellers
were
by
profession
christian
but
after
the
manner
of
the
bavarian
illuminati
and
of
the
christian
socialists
two
centuries
later
claiming
christ
as
the
author
of
their
communistic
and
equalitarian
doctrines
for
jesus
christ
the
saviour
of
all
men
is
the
greatest
first
and
truest
leveller
that
ever
was
spoken
of
in
the
world
the
levellers
are
said
to
have
derived
originally
from
the
german
anabaptists
but
claudio
jannet
quoting
german
authorities
shows
that
there
were
jews
amongst
the
anabaptists
they
were
carried
away
by
their
hatred
of
the
name
of
christian
and
imagined
that
their
dreams
of
the
restoration
of
the
kingdom
of
israel
would
be
realized
amidst
the
conflagration
whether
this
was
so
or
not
it
is
clear
that
by
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
mystical
ideas
of
judaism
had
penetrated
into
all
parts
of
europe
was
there
then
some
cabalistic
centre
from
which
they
radiated
let
us
turn
our
eyes
eastward
and
we
shall
see
since
the
sixteenth
century
the
great
mass
of
jewry
had
settled
in
poland
and
a
succession
of
known
by
the
name
of
zaddikim
or
shems
had
arisen
the
latter
word
which
signifies
master
of
the
name
originated
with
the
german
polish
jews
and
was
derived
from
the
cabalistic
belief
in
the
miraculous
use
of
the
sacred
name
of
jehovah
known
as
the
tetragrammaton
according
to
cabalistic
traditions
certain
jews
of
peculiar
sanctity
or
knowledge
were
able
with
impunity
to
make
use
of
the
divine
name
a
shem
was
therefore
one
who
had
acquired
this
power
and
employed
it
in
writing
amulets
invoking
spirits
and
prescribing
cures
for
various
diseases
poland
and
particularly
podolia
which
had
not
yet
been
ceded
to
russia
became
thus
a
centre
of
cabalism
where
a
series
of
extraordinary
movements
of
a
mystical
kind
followed
each
other
in
when
the
messianic
era
was
still
believed
to
be
approaching
the
whole
jewish
world
was
convulsed
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
shabbethai
zebi
the
son
of
a
poulterer
in
smyrna
named
mordecai
who
proclaimed
himself
the
promised
messiah
and
rallied
to
his
support
a
huge
following
not
only
amongst
the
jews
of
palestine
egypt
and
eastern
europe
but
even
the
jews
of
the
continental
bourses
samuel
pepys
in
his
diary
refers
to
the
bets
made
amongst
the
jews
in
london
on
the
chances
of
a
certain
person
now
in
smyrna
being
acclaimed
king
of
the
world
and
the
true
messiah
shabbethai
who
was
an
expert
cabalist
and
had
the
temerity
to
utter
the
ineffable
name
jehovah
was
said
to
be
possessed
of
marvellous
powers
his
skin
exuded
exquisite
perfume
he
indulged
perpetually
in
and
lived
in
a
state
of
chronic
ecstasy
the
pretensions
of
shabbethai
who
took
the
title
of
king
of
the
kings
of
the
earth
split
jewry
in
two
many
rabbis
launched
imprecations
against
him
and
those
who
had
believed
in
him
were
bitterly
disillusioned
when
challenged
by
the
sultan
to
prove
his
claim
to
be
the
messiah
by
allowing
poisoned
arrows
to
be
shot
at
him
he
suddenly
renounced
the
jewish
faith
and
proclaimed
himself
a
mohammedan
his
conversion
however
appeared
to
be
only
partial
for
at
times
he
would
assume
the
rôle
of
a
pious
mohammedan
and
revile
judaism
at
others
he
would
enter
into
relations
with
jews
as
one
of
their
own
faith
by
this
means
he
retained
the
allegiance
both
of
moslems
and
of
jews
but
the
rabbis
alarmed
for
the
cause
of
judaism
succeeded
in
obtaining
his
incarceration
by
the
sultan
in
a
castle
near
belgrade
where
he
died
of
colic
in
this
prosaic
ending
to
the
career
of
the
messiah
did
not
however
altogether
extinguish
the
enthusiasm
of
his
followers
and
the
shabbethan
movement
continued
into
the
next
century
in
poland
cabalism
broke
out
with
renewed
energy
fresh
zaddikim
and
shems
arose
the
most
noted
of
these
being
israel
of
podolia
known
as
shem
tob
or
by
the
initial
letters
of
this
name
besht
who
founded
his
sect
of
hasidim
in
besht
whilst
opposing
bigoted
rabbinism
and
claiming
the
zohar
as
his
inspiration
did
not
however
adhere
strictly
to
the
doctrine
of
the
cabala
that
the
universe
was
an
emanation
of
god
but
evolved
a
form
of
pantheism
declaring
that
the
whole
universe
was
god
that
even
evil
exists
in
god
since
evil
is
not
bad
in
itself
but
only
in
its
relation
to
man
sin
therefore
has
no
positive
existence
as
a
result
the
followers
of
besht
calling
themselves
the
new
saints
and
at
his
death
numbering
no
less
than
threw
aside
not
only
the
precepts
of
the
talmud
but
all
the
restraints
of
morality
and
even
decency
another
shem
of
the
same
period
was
heilprin
alias
joel
ben
uri
of
satanov
who
like
israel
of
podolia
professed
to
perform
miracles
by
the
use
of
the
divine
name
and
collected
around
him
many
pupils
who
on
the
death
of
their
master
formed
a
band
of
charlatans
and
shamelessly
exploited
the
credulity
of
their
contemporaries
but
the
most
important
of
these
cabalistic
groups
was
that
of
the
frankists
who
were
sometimes
known
as
the
zoharists
or
the
illuminated
from
their
adherence
to
the
zohar
or
book
of
light
or
in
their
birthplace
podolia
as
the
shabbethan
zebists
from
their
allegiance
to
the
false
messiah
of
the
preceding
century
a
heresy
that
had
been
kept
alive
in
secret
circles
which
had
something
akin
to
a
masonic
organization
the
founder
of
this
sect
was
jacob
frank
a
brandy
distiller
profoundly
versed
in
the
doctrines
of
the
cabala
who
in
collected
around
him
a
large
following
in
podolia
and
lived
in
a
style
of
oriental
magnificence
maintained
by
vast
wealth
of
which
no
one
ever
discovered
the
source
the
persecution
to
which
he
was
subjected
by
the
rabbis
led
the
catholic
clergy
to
champion
his
cause
whereupon
frank
threw
himself
on
the
mercy
of
the
bishop
of
kaminick
and
publicly
burnt
the
talmud
declaring
that
he
recognized
only
the
zohar
which
he
alleged
admitted
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
thus
the
zoharists
claimed
that
they
regarded
the
as
one
of
the
three
divinities
but
failed
to
state
that
by
the
messiah
they
meant
shabbethai
zebi
the
bishop
was
apparently
deceived
by
this
manoeuvre
and
in
the
zoharites
declared
themselves
converted
to
christianity
and
were
baptized
including
frank
himself
who
took
the
name
of
joseph
the
insincerity
of
the
frankists
soon
became
apparent
however
for
they
continued
to
only
among
themselves
and
held
frank
in
reverence
calling
him
holy
master
it
soon
became
evident
that
whilst
openly
embracing
the
catholic
faith
they
had
in
reality
retained
their
secret
judaism
moreover
it
was
discovered
that
frank
endeavoured
to
pass
as
a
mohammedan
in
turkey
he
was
therefore
arrested
in
warsaw
and
delivered
to
the
church
tribunal
on
the
charge
of
feigned
conversion
to
christianity
and
the
spreading
of
a
pernicious
heresy
unlike
his
predecessor
in
apostasy
shabbethai
zebi
frank
however
came
to
no
untimely
end
but
after
his
release
from
prison
continued
to
prey
on
the
credulity
of
christians
and
frequently
travelled
to
vienna
with
his
daughter
eve
who
succeeded
in
duping
the
pious
maria
theresa
but
here
also
the
sectarian
plans
of
frank
were
found
out
and
he
was
obliged
to
leave
austria
finally
he
settled
at
offenbach
and
supported
by
liberal
subsidies
from
the
other
jews
he
resumed
his
former
splendour
with
a
retinue
of
several
hundred
beautiful
jewish
youth
of
both
sexes
carts
containing
treasure
were
reported
to
be
perpetually
brought
in
to
him
chiefly
from
poland
he
went
out
daily
in
great
state
to
perform
his
devotions
in
the
open
field
he
rode
in
a
chariot
drawn
by
noble
horses
ten
or
twelve
hulans
in
red
or
green
uniform
glittering
with
gold
by
his
side
with
pikes
in
their
hands
and
crests
on
their
caps
eagles
or
stags
or
the
sun
and
moon
his
followers
believed
him
immortal
but
in
he
died
his
burial
was
as
splendid
as
his
mode
of
living
persons
followed
him
to
the
grave
now
it
is
impossible
to
study
the
careers
of
these
magicians
in
poland
and
germany
without
being
reminded
of
their
counterparts
in
france
the
family
likeness
between
the
baron
von
offenbach
the
comte
de
and
the
comte
de
cagliostro
is
at
once
apparent
all
claimed
to
perform
miracles
all
lived
with
extraordinary
magnificence
on
wealth
derived
from
an
unknown
source
one
was
certainly
a
jew
the
other
two
were
believed
to
be
jews
and
all
were
known
to
be
cabalists
moreover
all
three
spent
many
years
in
germany
and
it
was
whilst
frank
was
living
as
baron
von
offenbach
close
to
frankfurt
that
cagliostro
was
received
into
the
order
of
the
stricte
observance
in
a
subterranean
chamber
a
few
miles
from
that
city
earlier
in
his
career
he
was
known
to
have
visited
poland
whence
frank
derived
are
we
to
believe
that
all
these
men
so
strangely
alike
in
their
careers
living
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
places
were
totally
unconnected
it
is
a
mere
coincidence
that
this
group
of
jewish
cabalist
should
have
existed
in
germany
and
poland
at
the
precise
moment
that
the
cabalist
magicians
sprang
up
in
france
is
it
again
a
coincidence
that
martines
pasqually
founded
his
kabbalistic
sect
of
illuminés
in
and
jacob
frank
his
sect
of
zoharites
or
illuminated
in
moreover
when
we
know
from
purely
jewish
sources
that
the
shem
heilprin
had
many
pupils
who
formed
a
band
of
charlatans
who
shamelessly
exploited
the
credulity
of
their
contemporaries
that
the
shem
tob
and
jacob
frank
both
had
large
followings
it
is
surely
here
that
we
may
find
the
origin
of
those
mysterious
magicians
who
spread
themselves
over
europe
at
this
date
it
will
at
once
be
asked
but
what
proof
is
there
that
any
one
of
these
shems
or
cabalists
was
connected
with
masonic
or
secret
societies
the
answer
is
that
the
most
important
shem
of
the
day
known
as
the
chief
of
all
the
jews
is
shown
by
documentary
evidence
to
have
been
an
initiate
of
freemasonry
and
in
direct
contact
with
the
leaders
of
the
secret
societies
if
then
it
is
agreed
that
neither
nor
cagliostro
can
be
proved
to
have
been
jews
here
we
have
a
man
concerned
in
the
movement
more
important
than
either
whose
nationality
admits
of
no
doubt
whatever
this
extraordinary
personage
known
as
the
shem
of
london
was
a
cabalistic
jew
named
hayyim
samuel
jacob
falk
also
called
falk
falc
de
falk
or
falkon
born
in
probably
in
podolia
the
further
fact
that
he
was
regarded
by
his
as
an
adherent
of
the
messiah
shabbethai
zebi
clearly
shows
his
connexion
with
the
podolian
zoharites
falk
was
thus
not
an
isolated
phenomenon
but
a
member
of
one
of
the
groups
described
in
the
foregoing
pages
the
following
is
a
summary
of
the
account
given
of
the
shem
of
london
in
the
falk
claimed
to
possess
thaumaturgic
powers
and
to
be
able
to
discover
hidden
treasure
archenholz
und
i
recounts
certain
marvels
which
he
had
seen
performed
by
falk
in
brunswick
and
which
he
attributes
to
a
special
knowledge
of
chemistry
in
westphalia
at
one
time
falk
was
sentenced
to
be
burned
as
a
sorcerer
but
escaped
to
england
here
he
was
received
with
hospitality
and
rapidly
gained
fame
as
a
cabalist
and
worker
of
miracles
many
stories
of
his
powers
were
current
he
would
cause
a
small
taper
to
remain
alight
for
weeks
an
incantation
would
fill
his
cellar
with
coal
plate
left
with
a
pawnbroker
would
glide
back
into
his
house
when
a
fire
threatened
to
destroy
the
great
synagogue
he
averted
the
disaster
by
writing
four
hebrew
letters
on
the
pillars
of
the
door
obviously
the
tetragrammaton
on
his
arrival
in
london
in
falk
appeared
to
be
without
means
but
soon
after
he
was
seen
to
be
in
possession
of
considerable
wealth
living
in
a
comfortable
house
in
wellclose
square
where
he
had
his
private
synagogue
whilst
gold
and
silver
plate
adorned
his
table
his
journal
still
preserved
in
the
library
of
the
united
synagogue
contains
references
to
mysterious
journeyings
to
and
from
epping
forest
to
meetings
a
in
the
forest
and
chests
of
gold
there
buried
it
was
said
that
on
one
occasion
when
he
was
driving
thither
along
whitechapel
road
a
back
wheel
of
his
carriage
came
off
which
alarmed
the
coachman
but
falk
ordered
him
to
drive
on
and
the
wheel
followed
the
carriage
all
the
way
to
the
forest
the
stories
of
falk
miraculous
powers
are
too
numerous
to
relate
here
but
a
letter
written
by
an
enthusiastic
jewish
admirer
sussman
shesnowzi
to
his
son
in
poland
will
serve
to
show
the
reputation
he
enjoyed
hear
my
beloved
son
of
the
marvellous
gifts
entrusted
to
a
son
of
man
who
verily
is
not
a
man
a
light
of
the
captivity
a
holy
light
a
saintly
man
who
dwells
at
present
in
the
great
city
of
london
albeit
i
could
not
fully
understand
him
on
account
of
his
volubility
and
his
speaking
as
an
inhabitant
of
jerusalem
his
chamber
is
lighted
by
silver
candlesticks
on
the
walls
with
a
central
lamp
made
of
pure
silver
of
beaten
work
and
albeit
it
contained
oil
to
burn
a
day
and
a
night
it
remained
enkindled
for
three
weeks
on
one
occasion
he
abode
in
seclusion
in
his
house
for
six
weeks
without
meat
and
drink
when
at
the
conclusion
of
this
period
ten
persons
were
summoned
to
enter
they
found
him
seated
on
a
sort
of
throne
his
head
covered
with
a
golden
turban
a
golden
chain
round
his
neck
with
a
pendant
silver
star
on
which
sacred
names
were
inscribed
verily
this
man
stands
alone
in
his
generation
by
reason
of
his
knowledge
of
holy
mysteries
i
can
not
recount
to
you
all
the
wonders
he
accomplishes
i
am
grateful
in
that
i
am
found
worthy
to
be
received
among
those
who
dwell
within
the
shadow
of
his
wisdom
i
know
that
many
will
believe
my
words
but
others
who
do
not
occupy
themselves
with
mysteries
will
laugh
thereat
therefore
my
son
be
very
circumspect
and
show
this
only
to
wise
and
discreet
men
for
here
in
london
this
master
has
not
been
disclosed
to
anyone
who
does
not
belong
to
our
brotherhood
the
esteem
in
which
falk
was
held
by
the
jewish
community
including
the
chief
rabbi
and
the
rabbi
of
the
new
synagogue
appears
to
have
roused
the
resentment
of
his
emden
who
denounced
him
as
a
follower
of
the
false
messiah
and
an
exploiter
of
christian
credulity
falk
he
wrote
in
a
letter
to
poland
had
made
his
position
by
his
pretence
to
be
an
adept
in
practical
cabala
by
which
means
he
professed
to
be
able
to
discover
hidden
treasures
by
his
pretensions
he
had
entrapped
a
wealthy
captain
whose
fortune
he
had
cheated
him
out
of
so
that
he
was
reduced
to
depending
on
the
rabbi
charity
and
yet
despite
this
wealthy
christians
spend
their
money
on
him
whilst
falk
spends
his
bounty
on
the
men
of
his
brotherhood
so
that
they
may
spread
his
fame
in
general
falk
appears
to
have
displayed
extreme
caution
in
his
relations
with
christian
seekers
after
occult
knowledge
for
the
goes
on
to
say
archenholz
mentions
a
royal
prince
who
applied
to
falk
in
his
quest
for
the
philosopher
stone
but
was
denied
admittance
nevertheless
hayyum
azulai
mentions
tob
that
when
in
paris
in
he
was
told
by
the
marchesa
de
crona
that
the
shem
of
london
had
taught
her
the
cabala
falk
seems
also
to
have
been
on
intimate
terms
with
that
strange
adventurer
baron
theodor
de
neuhoff
falk
principal
friends
were
the
london
bankers
aaron
goldsmid
and
his
son
pawnbroking
and
successful
speculation
enabled
him
to
acquire
a
considerable
fortune
he
left
large
sums
of
money
to
charity
and
the
overseers
of
the
united
synagogue
in
london
still
distribute
annually
certain
payments
left
by
him
for
the
poor
nothing
of
all
this
would
lead
one
to
suppose
that
falk
could
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
black
magician
it
is
therefore
surprising
to
find
adler
observing
that
a
horrible
account
of
a
jewish
cabalist
in
gentleman
for
september
obviously
refers
to
falk
though
his
name
is
not
mentioned
this
man
is
described
as
a
christened
jew
and
the
biggest
rogue
and
villain
in
all
the
world
who
had
been
imprisoned
everywhere
and
banished
out
of
all
countries
in
germany
and
also
sometimes
publicly
whipped
so
that
his
back
lost
all
the
old
skin
and
became
new
again
and
yet
left
never
off
from
his
villainies
but
grew
always
worse
the
writer
goes
on
to
relate
that
the
cabalist
offered
to
teach
him
certain
mysteries
but
explained
that
before
entering
on
any
experiments
of
the
said
godly
mysteries
we
must
first
avoid
all
churches
and
places
of
worshipping
as
unclean
he
then
bound
his
initiate
by
a
very
strong
oath
and
proceeded
to
tell
him
that
he
must
steal
a
hebrew
bible
from
a
protestant
and
also
procure
one
pound
of
blood
out
of
the
veins
of
an
honest
protestant
the
initiate
thereupon
robbed
a
protestant
of
all
his
effects
but
had
himself
bled
of
about
of
a
pound
of
blood
which
he
gave
to
the
magician
he
thus
describes
the
ceremony
that
took
place
then
the
next
night
about
we
both
went
into
the
garden
of
my
own
and
the
cabalist
put
a
cross
tainted
with
my
blood
in
each
corner
of
the
garden
and
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
a
threefold
circle
in
the
first
circle
were
written
all
the
names
of
god
in
hebrew
in
the
second
all
the
names
of
the
angels
and
in
the
third
the
first
chapter
of
the
holy
gospel
of
john
and
it
was
all
written
with
my
blood
the
cruelties
then
performed
by
the
cabalist
on
a
are
too
loathsome
to
transcribe
the
whole
story
indeed
appears
a
farrago
of
nonsense
and
would
not
be
worth
quoting
but
for
the
fact
that
it
appears
to
be
taken
seriously
by
adler
as
a
description
of
the
great
shem
the
death
of
falk
took
place
on
april
and
the
epitaph
on
his
grave
in
the
cemetery
at
globe
road
mile
end
bears
witness
to
his
excellencies
and
orthodoxy
here
is
interred
the
aged
and
honourable
man
a
great
personage
who
came
from
the
east
an
accomplished
sage
an
adept
in
cabbalah
his
name
was
known
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
distant
isles
etc
this
then
is
surely
the
portrait
of
a
most
remarkable
personage
a
man
known
for
his
powers
in
england
france
and
germany
visited
by
a
royal
prince
in
search
of
the
philosopher
stone
and
acclaimed
by
one
of
his
own
race
as
standing
alone
in
his
generation
by
reason
of
his
knowledge
yet
whilst
and
cagliostro
figure
in
every
account
of
magicians
it
is
only
in
exclusively
judaic
or
masonic
works
not
intended
for
the
general
public
that
we
shall
find
any
reference
to
falk
have
we
not
here
striking
evidence
of
the
truth
of
andré
baron
dictum
remember
that
the
constant
rule
of
the
secret
societies
is
that
the
real
authors
never
show
themselves
it
will
now
be
asked
what
proof
is
there
that
falk
is
connected
with
any
masonic
or
secret
societies
true
in
the
accounts
given
by
the
the
word
freemasonry
is
not
once
mentioned
but
in
the
curious
portrait
of
the
great
shem
appended
we
see
him
holding
in
his
hand
the
pair
of
compasses
and
before
him
on
the
table
at
which
he
is
seated
the
double
triangle
or
seal
of
solomon
known
amongst
jews
as
the
shield
of
david
which
forms
an
important
emblem
in
masonry
moreover
it
is
significant
to
find
in
the
masonic
by
the
rosicrucian
kenneth
mackenzie
that
a
long
and
detailed
article
is
devoted
to
falk
though
again
without
any
reference
to
his
connexion
with
freemasonry
may
we
not
conclude
that
in
certain
inner
masonic
circles
the
importance
of
falk
is
recognized
but
must
not
be
revealed
to
the
uninitiated
gordon
hills
in
the
paper
contributed
to
the
quatuor
indulges
in
some
innocent
speculation
as
to
the
part
falk
may
have
played
in
the
masonic
movement
if
he
observes
jewish
brethren
did
introduce
cabalistical
learning
into
the
high
degrees
here
we
have
one
who
if
a
mason
would
have
been
eminently
qualified
to
do
so
falk
inded
was
far
more
than
a
mason
he
was
a
high
initiate
the
supreme
oracle
to
which
the
secret
societies
applied
for
guidance
all
this
was
disclosed
a
few
years
ago
in
the
correspondence
between
savalette
de
langes
and
the
marquis
de
chefdebien
referred
to
in
the
previous
chapter
thus
in
the
of
the
leading
occultists
supplied
by
savalette
we
find
the
following
note
on
the
shem
of
london
this
doctor
falk
is
known
to
many
germans
he
is
a
very
extraordinary
man
from
every
point
of
view
some
people
believe
him
to
be
the
chief
of
all
the
jews
and
attribute
to
purely
political
schemes
all
that
is
marvellous
and
singular
in
his
life
and
conduct
he
is
referred
to
in
a
very
curious
manner
and
as
a
in
the
of
the
chevalier
de
rentzov
he
has
had
adventures
with
the
maréchal
de

great
seeker
of
the
philosophers
stone
he
had
a
strange
history
with
the
prince
de
rohan
guéménée
and
the
chevalier
de
luxembourg
relating
to
louis
xv
whose
death
he
foretold
he
is
almost
inaccessible
in
all
the
sects
of
savants
in
secret
sciences
he
passes
as
a
superior
man
he
is
at
present
in
england
the
baron
de
gleichen
can
give
good
information
about
him
try
to
get
more
at
frankfurt
again
in
notes
on
other
personages
the
name
of
falk
recurs
with
the
same
insistence
on
his
importance
as
a
high
initiate
leman
pupil
of
falk
the
baron
de
gleichen
intimately
connected
with
wecter
waechter
and
wakenfeldt
he
knows
falk
the
baron
de
waldenfels
is
according
to
what
i
know
from
the
baron
de
gleichen
the
princes
of
daimstadt
and
others
the
most
interesting
man
for
you
and
me
to
know
if
we
made
his
acquaintance
he
could
give
us
the
best
information
on
all
the
most
interesting
objects
of
instiuction
he
knows
falk
and
wecter
prince
louis
is
also
a
member
of
the
amis

and
in
charge
of
the
directories
he
worked
in
his
youth
with
a
jew
whom
he
believes
to
be
taught
by
falk
here
then
behind
the
organization
of
the
stricte
observance
of
the
amis
réunis
and
the
philalèthes
we
catch
a
glimpse
at
last
of
one
of
those
whose
identity
has
been
so
carefully
kept
dark
for
falk
as
we
see
in
these
notes
was
not
an
isolated
sage
he
had
pupils
and
to
be
one
of
these
was
to
be
admitted
to
the
inner
mysteries
was
cagliostro
one
of
these
adepts
is
it
here
we
may
seek
the
explanation
of
the
egyptian
rite
devised
by
him
in
london
and
of
his
chance
discovery
on
a
bookstall
in
that
city
of
a
cabalistic
document
by
the
mysterious
george
cofton
whose
identity
has
never
been
revealed
i
would
suggest
that
the
whole
story
of
the
bookstall
was
a
fable
and
that
it
was
not
from
any
manuscript
but
from
falk
that
cagliostro
received
his
directions
thus
cagliostro
rite
was
in
reality
concealed
cabalism
that
falk
was
only
one
of
several
concealed
superiors
is
further
suggested
by
the
intriguing
correspondence
of
savalette
de
langes
schroeder
we
read
had
for
his
master
an
old
man
of
suabia
by
whom
the
baron
de
waechter
was
also
said
to
have
been
instructed
in
masonry
and
to
have
become
one
of
the
most
important
initiates
of
germany
accordingly
de
waechter
was
despatched
by
his
order
to
florence
in
order
to
make
enquiries
on
further
secrets
and
on
certain
famous
treasures
about
which
schroepfer
the
baron
de
hundt
and
others
had
heard
that
aprosi
the
secretary
of
the
pretender
could
give
them
information
waechter
however
wrote
to
say
that
all
they
had
been
told
on
the
latter
point
was
fabulous
but
that
he
had
met
in
florence
certain
brothers
of
the
holy
land
who
had
initiated
him
into
marvellous
secrets
one
in
particular
who
is
described
as
a
man
who
is
not
a
european
had
perfectly
instructed
him
moreover
de
waechter
who
had
set
forth
poor
returned
loaded
with
riches
attributed
by
his
to
the
asiatic
brethren
he
had
frequented
in
florence
who
possessed
the
art
of
making
gold
i
would
suggest
then
that
these
were
the
members
of
the
italian
order
referred
to
by
tuckett
which
like
schroepfer
and
de
hundt
he
imagined
to
have
been
connected
with
the
jacobites
but
all
these
secret
sources
of
instruction
are
wrapped
in
mystery
whilst
and
cagliostro
who
is
referred
to
in
this
correspondence
in
terms
of
light
derision
emerge
into
the
limelight
the
real
initiates
remain
concealed
in
the
background
falk
is
almost
inaccessible
yet
one
more
almost
forgotten
document
of
the
period
may
throw
some
light
on
the
important
part
he
played
behind
the
scenes
in
masonry
it
may
be
remembered
that
archenholz
had
spoken
of
certain
marvels
he
had
seen
performed
by
falk
in
brunswick
now
in
the
german
poet
gotthold
ephraim
lessing
was
made
librarian
to
the
duke
of
brunswick
in
that
city
the
fame
of
falk
may
then
have
reached
his
ears
at
any
rate
in
lessing
after
having
mocked
at
freemasonry
was
initiated
in
a
masonic
lodge
at
hamburg
and
in
he
published
not
only
his
famous
masonic
drama
der
in
which
the
jew
of
jerusalem
is
shown
in
admirable
contrast
to
the
christians
and
mohammedans
but
he
also
wrote
five
dialogues
on
freemasonry
which
he
dedicated
to
the
duke
of
brunswick
grand
master
of
all
the
german
lodges
and
which
he
entitled
und
falk
gespräche
fur
lessing
friendship
with
moses
mendelssohn
has
led
to
the
popular
theory
unsupported
however
by
any
real
evidence
that
the
jewish
philosopher
of
berlin
provided
the
inspiration
for
the
character
of
nathan
but
might
it
not
equally
have
been
provided
by
the
of
brunswick
however
in
the
case
of
the
dialogues
less
room
is
left
for
doubt
falk
is
mentioned
by
name
and
represented
as
initiated
into
the
highest
mysteries
of
freemasonry
this
is
of
course
not
explained
by
lessing
commentators
who
give
no
clue
to
his
identity
it
is
evident
that
lessing
committed
an
enormous
blunder
in
thus
letting
so
important
a
cat
out
of
the
bag
for
after
the
publication
of
the
first
three
dialogues
and
whilst
the
last
two
were
circulating
privately
in
manuscript
amongst
the
freemasons
an
order
from
the
duke
of
brunswick
forbade
their
publication
as
dangerous
in
spite
of
this
prohibition
the
rest
of
the
series
was
printed
however
without
lessing
permission
in
with
a
preface
by
an
unknown
person
describing
himself
as
a
the
dialogues
between
ernst
and
falk
throw
a
curious
light
on
the
influences
at
work
behind
freemasonry
at
this
period
and
gain
immensely
in
interest
when
the
identity
of
the
two
men
in
question
is
understood
thus
ernst
by
whom
lessing
evidently
represents
himself
is
at
the
beginning
not
a
freemason
and
whilst
sitting
with
falk
in
a
wood
questions
the
high
initiate
on
the
aims
of
the
order
falk
explains
that
freemasonry
has
always
existed
but
not
under
this
name
its
real
purpose
has
never
been
revealed
on
the
surface
it
appears
to
be
a
purely
philanthropic
association
but
in
reality
philanthropy
forms
no
part
of
its
scheme
its
object
being
to
bring
about
a
state
of
things
which
will
render
philanthropy
unnecessary
man
gemeinlich
gute
thaten
zu
nennen
pflegt
entbehrlich
zu
as
an
illustration
falk
points
to
an
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
beneath
which
the
two
men
are
seated
why
he
asks
should
not
human
beings
exist
without
government
like
the
ants
or
bees
falk
then
goes
on
to
describe
his
idea
of
a
universal
state
or
rather
a
federation
of
states
in
which
men
will
no
longer
be
divided
by
national
social
or
religious
prejudices
and
where
greater
equality
will
exist
at
the
end
of
the
third
dialogue
an
interval
occurs
during
which
ernst
goes
away
and
becomes
a
freemason
but
on
his
return
expresses
his
disappointment
to
falk
at
finding
many
freemasons
engaged
in
such
futilities
as
alchemy
or
the
evocation
of
spirits
others
again
seek
to
revive
the
falk
replies
that
although
the
great
secrets
of
freemasonry
can
not
be
revealed
by
any
man
even
if
he
wished
it
one
thing
however
has
been
kept
dark
which
should
now
be
made
public
and
this
is
the
relationship
between
the
freemasons
and
the
the
were
in
fact
the
freemasons
of
their
time
it
seems
probable
from
the
context
and
from
falk
references
to
sir
christopher
wren
as
the
founder
of
the
modern
order
that
the
asterisks
denote
the
rosicrucians
the
most
interesting
point
of
these
dialogues
is
however
the
hint
continually
thrown
out
by
falk
that
there
is
something
behind
freemasonry
something
far
older
and
far
wider
in
its
aims
than
the
order
now
known
by
this
name
the
modern
freemasons
are
for
the
most
part
only
playing
at
it
thus
when
ernst
complains
that
true
equality
has
not
been
attained
in
the
lodges
since
jews
are
not
admitted
falk
observes
that
he
himself
does
not
attend
them
that
true
freemasonry
does
not
exist
in
outward
forms
a
lodge
bears
the
same
relation
to
freemasonry
as
a
church
to
belief
in
other
words
the
real
initiates
do
not
appear
upon
the
scene
here
then
we
see
the
role
of
the
concealed
superiors
what
wonder
that
lessing
dialogues
were
considered
too
dangerous
for
publication
moreover
in
falk
conception
of
the
ideal
social
order
and
his
indictment
of
what
he
calls
bourgeois
society
we
find
the
clue
to
movements
of
immense
importance
has
not
the
system
of
the
or
the
beehive
proved
as
i
have
pointed
out
elsewhere
the
model
on
which
modern
anarchists
from
proudhon
onwards
have
formed
their
schemes
for
the
reorganization
of
human
life
has
not
the
idea
of
the
world
state
the
universal
republic
become
the
of
the
internationalist
socialists
the
grand
orient
masons
the
theosophists
and
the
of
our
own
day
was
falk
then
a
revolutionary
this
again
will
be
disputed
falk
may
have
been
a
cabalist
a
freemason
a
high
initiate
but
what
proof
is
there
that
he
had
any
connexion
with
the
leaders
of
the
french
revolution
let
us
turn
again
to
the
falk
is
believed
to
have
given
the
duc
to
ensure
his
succession
to
the
throne
a
talisman
consisting
of
a
ring
which
philippe
egalité
before
mounting
the
scaffold
is
said
to
have
sent
to
a
jewess
juliet
goudchaux
who
passed
it
on
to
his
son
subsequently
louis
philippe
the
baron
de
gleichen
who
knew
falc
refers
to
a
talisman
of
which
the
due
had
received
in
england
from
the
celebrated
falk
scheck
first
rabbi
of
the
jews
and
says
that
a
certain
occultist
madame
de
la
croix
imagined
she
had
destroyed
it
by
the
power
of
prayer
but
the
theory
of
its
survival
is
further
confirmed
by
the
information
supplied
from
jewish
sources
to
gordon
hills
who
states
that
falk
was
in
touch
with
the
french
court
in
the
person
of
emanuel
whom
he
describes
as
a
servant
of
the
king
of
france
and
adds
that
the
talismanic
ring
which
he
gave
to
the
due
is
still
in
the
possession
of
the
family
having
passed
to
king
louis
philippe
and
thence
to
the
comte
de
paris
one
fact
then
looms
out
of
the
darkness
that
envelops
the
secret
power
behind
the
orléanist
conspiracy
one
fact
of
supreme
importance
and
based
moreover
on
purely
jewish
evidence
the
duke
was
in
touch
with
falk
when
in
london
and
falk
supported
his
scheme
of
usurpation
thus
behind
the
of
the
revolution
stood
the
chief
of
all
the
jews
is
it
here
perhaps
in
falk
chests
of
gold
that
we
might
find
the
source
of
some
of
those
loans
raised
in
london
by
the
due
to
finance
the
riots
of
the
revolution
so
absurdly
described
as
de
pitt
the
direct
connexion
between
the
attack
on
the
french
monarchy
and
jewish
circles
in
london
is
further
shown
by
the
curious
sequel
to
the
gordon
riots
in
the
lord
george
gordon
as
a
jewish
writer
describes
him
the
head
of
the
protestant
mob
marched
on
the
house
of
commons
to
protest
against
the
bill
for
the
relief
of
roman
catholic
disabilities
and
then
proceeded
to
carry
out
his
plan
of
burning
down
london
during
the
five
days
rioting
that
ensued
property
to
the
amount
of
was
destroyed
after
this
the
scion
of
the
ducal
house
of
gordon
proved
the
durability
of
his
love
for
protestantism
by
professing
the
hebrew
faith
and
was
received
with
the
highest
honours
into
the
synagogue
the
same
jewish
writer
who
has
described
him
earlier
as
quotes
this
panegyric
on
his
orthodoxy
he
was
very
regular
in
his
jewish
observances
every
morning
he
was
seen
with
the
philacteries
between
his
eyes
and
opposite
his
heart
his
saturday
bread
was
baked
according
to
the
manner
of
the
jews
his
wine
was
jewish
his
meat
was
jewish
and
he
was
the
best
jew
in
the
congregation
of
israel
and
it
was
immediately
after
his
conversion
to
judaism
that
he
published
in
public
the
libel
against
marie
antoinette
which
brought
about
his
imprisonment
in
newgate
now
we
know
that
lord
george
gordon
met
cagliostro
in
london
in
is
it
not
probable
that
the
author
of
the
scurrilous
pamphlet
and
the
magician
concerned
in
the
attack
on
the
queen
honour
through
the
affair
of
the
necklace
one
a
jew
by
profession
the
other
said
to
be
a
jew
by
race
may
have
had
some
connexion
with
philippe
jewish
supporter
the
miracle
worker
of
wellclose
square
but
already
a
vaster
genius
than
falk
or
cagliostro
than
pasqually
or
savalette
de
langes
had
arisen
who
gathering
into
his
hands
the
threads
of
all
the
conspiracies
was
able
to
weave
them
together
into
a
gigantic
scheme
for
the
destruction
of
france
and
of
the
world
the
bavarian
illuminati
the
question
of
the
system
to
which
i
shall
henceforth
refer
simply
as
illuminism
is
of
such
immense
importance
to
an
understanding
of
the
modern
revolutionary
movement
that
although
i
have
already
described
it
in
detail
in
it
is
necessary
to
devote
a
further
chapter
to
it
here
in
order
to
answer
the
objections
made
against
my
former
account
of
the
order
and
also
to
show
its
connexion
with
earlier
secret
societies
now
the
main
contentions
of
those
writers
who
either
consciously
or
unconsciously
attempt
to
mislead
the
public
on
the
true
nature
and
real
existence
of
illuminism
are
firstly
that
the
case
against
illuminism
rests
solely
on
the
works
of
robison
and
of
barruel
and
later
catholic
authorities
secondly
that
all
these
writers
misinterpreted
or
misquoted
the
illuminati
who
should
be
judged
only
by
their
own
works
thirdly
that
in
reality
the
illuminati
were
perfectly
innocuous
and
even
praiseworthy
fourthly
that
they
are
of
no
importance
since
they
ceased
to
exist
in
in
the
present
chapter
i
propose
therefore
to
answer
all
these
contentions
in
turn
and
at
the
same
time
to
make
further
examination
into
the
origins
of
the
order
origins
of
the
illuminati
that
weishaupt
was
not
the
originator
of
the
system
he
named
illuminism
will
be
already
apparent
to
every
reader
of
the
present
work
it
has
needed
in
fact
all
the
foregoing
chapters
to
trace
the
source
of
weishaupt
doctrines
throughout
the
history
of
the
world
from
these
it
will
be
evident
that
men
aiming
at
the
overthrow
of
the
existing
social
order
and
of
all
accepted
religion
had
existed
from
the
earliest
times
and
that
in
the
cainites
the
carpocratians
the
manichæns
the
batinis
the
fatimites
and
the
karmathites
many
of
weishaupt
ideas
had
already
been
foreshadowed
to
the
manichæans
in
fact
the
word
illuminati
may
be
traced
gloriantur
manichæi
se
de
caelo
illuminatos
it
is
in
the
sect
of
abdullah
ibn
maymūn
that
we
must
seek
the
model
for
weishaupt
system
of
organization
thus
de
sacy
has
described
in
the
following
words
the
manner
of
enlisting
proselytes
by
the
ismailis
they
proceeded
to
the
admission
and
initiation
of
new
proselytes
only
by
degrees
and
with
great
reserve
for
as
the
sect
had
at
the
same
time
a
political
object
and
ambitions
its
interest
was
above
all
to
have
a
great
number
of
partisans
in
all
places
and
in
all
classes
of
society
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
suit
themselves
to
the
character
the
temperament
and
the
prejudices
of
the
greater
number
what
one
revealed
to
some
would
have
revolted
others
and
alienated
for
ever
spirits
less
bold
and
consciences
more
easily
alarmed
this
passage
exactly
describes
the
methods
laid
down
by
weishaupt
for
his
insinuating
brothers
the
necessity
of
proceeding
with
caution
in
the
enlisting
of
adepts
of
not
revealing
to
the
novice
doctrines
that
might
be
likely
to
revolt
him
of
speaking
sometimes
in
one
way
sometimes
in
another
so
that
one
real
purpose
should
remain
impenetrable
to
members
of
the
inferior
grades
how
did
these
oriental
methods
penetrate
to
the
bavarian
professor
according
to
certain
writers
through
the
jesuits
the
fact
that
weishaupt
had
been
brought
up
by
this
order
has
provided
the
enemies
of
the
jesuits
with
the
argument
that
they
were
the
secret
inspirers
of
the
illuminati
gould
indeed
has
attributed
most
of
the
errors
of
the
latter
to
this
source
weishaupt
he
writes
incurred
the
implacable
enmity
of
the
jesuits
to
whose
intrigues
he
was
incessantly
exposed
in
reality
precisely
the
opposite
was
the
case
for
as
we
shall
see
it
was
weishaupt
who
perpetually
intrigued
against
the
jesuits
that
weishaupt
did
however
draw
to
a
certain
extent
on
jesuit
methods
of
training
is
recognized
even
by
barruel
himself
a
jesuit
who
quoting
mirabeau
says
that
weishaupt
admired
above
all
those
laws
that
of
the
jesuits
which
under
one
head
made
men
dispersed
over
the
universe
tend
towards
the
same
goal
he
felt
that
one
could
imitate
their
methods
whilst
holding
views
diametrically
opposed
and
again
on
the
evidence
of
mirabeau
de
luchet
and
von
knigge
barruel
says
elsewhere
it
is
here
that
weishaupt
appears
specially
to
have
wished
to
assimilate
the
régime
of
the
sect
to
that
of
the
religious
orders
and
above
all
that
of
the
jesuits
by
the
total
abandonment
of
their
own
will
and
judgement
which
he
demands
of
his
adepts
but
barruel
goes
on
to
show
the
enormous
difference
that
is
to
be
found
between
religious
obedience
and
illuminist
obedience
in
every
religious
order
men
know
that
the
voice
of
their
conscience
and
of
their
god
is
even
more
to
be
obeyed
than
that
of
their
superiors
there
is
not
a
single
one
who
in
the
event
that
his
superiors
should
order
him
to
do
things
contrary
to
the
duties
of
a
christian
or
of
a
good
man
would
not
see
an
exception
to
be
made
to
the
obedience
which
he
has
sworn
this
exception
is
often
expressed
and
always
clearly
announced
in
all
religious
institutions
it
is
above
all
formal
and
positively
repeated
many
times
in
that
of
the
jesuits
they
are
ordered
to
obey
their
superiors
but
it
is
in
the
event
that
they
see
no
sin
in
obeying
non
cerneretur
peccatum
constitution
des
part
chapter
i

vol
édition

indeed
implicit
obedience
and
the
total
surrender
of
one
own
will
and
judgement
forms
the
foundation
of
all
military
discipline
theirs
not
to
reason
why
theirs
not
to
make
reply
is
everywhere
recognized
as
the
duty
of
soldiers
the
jesuits
being
in
a
sense
a
military
order
acknowledging
a
general
at
their
head
are
bound
by
the
same
obligation
weishaupt
system
was
something
totally
different
for
whilst
all
soldiers
and
all
jesuits
when
obeying
their
superiors
are
well
aware
of
the
goal
towards
which
they
are
tending
weishaupt
followers
were
enlisted
by
the
most
subtle
methods
of
deception
and
led
on
towards
a
goal
entirely
unknown
to
them
it
is
this
that
as
we
shall
see
later
constitutes
the
whole
difference
between
honest
and
dishonest
secret
societies
the
fact
is
that
the
accusation
of
jesuit
intrigue
behind
secret
societies
has
emanated
principally
from
the
secret
societies
themselves
and
would
appear
to
have
been
a
device
adopted
by
them
to
cover
their
own
tracks
no
good
evidence
has
ever
been
brought
forward
in
support
of
their
contention
the
jesuits
unlike
the
templars
and
the
illuminati
were
simply
suppressed
in
without
the
formality
of
a
trial
and
were
therefore
never
given
the
opportunity
to
answer
the
charges
brought
against
them
nor
as
in
the
case
of
these
other
orders
were
their
secret
statutes
if
any
such
existed
brought
to
light
the
only
document
ever
produced
in
proof
of
these
accusations
was
the
monita
secreta
long
since
shown
to
be
a
forgery
at
any
rate
the
correspondence
of
the
illuminati
provides
their
best
exoneration
the
marquis
de
luchet
who
was
no
friend
of
the
jesuits
shows
the
absurdity
of
confounding
their
aims
with
those
of
either
the
freemasons
or
the
illuminati
and
describes
all
three
as
animated
by
wholly
different
purposes
in
all
these
questions
it
is
necessary
to
seek
a
motive
i
have
no
personal
interest
in
defending
the
jesuits
but
i
ask
what
motive
could
the
jesuits
have
in
forming
or
supporting
a
conspiracy
directed
against
all
thrones
and
altars
it
has
been
answered
me
that
the
jesuits
at
this
period
cared
nothing
for
thrones
and
altars
but
only
for
temporal
power
yet
even
accepting
this
unwarrantable
hypothesis
how
was
this
power
to
be
exercised
except
through
thrones
and
altars
was
it
not
through
princes
and
the
church
that
the
jesuits
had
been
able
to
bring
their
influence
to
bear
on
affairs
of
state
in
an
irreligious
republic
as
events
afterwards
proved
the
power
of
the
whole
clergy
was
bound
to
be
destroyed
the
truth
is
then
that
far
from
abetting
the
illuminati
the
jesuits
were
their
most
formidable
opponents
the
only
body
of
men
sufficiently
learned
astute
and
well
organized
to
outwit
the
schemes
of
weishaupt
in
suppressing
the
jesuits
it
is
possible
that
the
old
régime
removed
the
only
barrier
capable
of
resisting
the
tide
of
revolution
weishaupt
indeed
as
we
know
detested
the
jesuits
and
took
from
them
only
certain
methods
of
discipline
of
ensuring
obedience
or
of
acquiring
influence
over
the
minds
of
his
disciples
his
aims
were
entirely
different
where
then
did
weishaupt
find
his
immediate
inspiration
it
is
here
that
barruel
and
lecouteulx
de
canteleu
provide
a
clue
not
to
be
discovered
in
other
sources
in
they
relate
a
certain
jutland
merchant
named
kölmer
who
had
spent
many
years
in
egypt
returned
to
europe
in
search
of
converts
to
a
secret
doctrine
founded
on
manichæism
that
he
had
learnt
in
the
east
on
his
way
to
france
he
stopped
at
malta
where
he
met
cagliostro
and
nearly
brought
about
an
insurrection
amongst
the
people
kölmer
was
therefore
driven
out
of
the
island
by
the
knights
of
malta
and
betook
himself
to
avignon
and
lyons
here
he
made
a
few
disciples
amongst
the
illuminés
and
in
the
same
year
went
on
to
germany
where
he
encountered
weishaupt
and
initiated
him
into
all
the
mysteries
of
his
secret
doctrine
according
to
barruel
weishaupt
then
spent
five
years
thinking
out
his
system
which
he
founded
under
the
name
of
illuminati
on
may
and
assumed
the
illuminated
name
of
spartacus
kölmer
remains
the
most
mysterious
of
all
the
mystery
men
of
his
day
at
first
sight
one
is
inclined
to
wonder
whether
he
may
not
have
been
another
of
the
cabalistic
jews
acting
as
the
secret
inspirers
of
the
magicians
who
appeared
in
the
limelight
the
name
kölmer
might
easily
have
been
a
corruption
of
the
jewish
name
calmer
lecouteulx
de
canteleu
however
suggests
that
kölmer
was
identical
with
altolas
described
by
figuier
as
this
universal
genius
almost
divine
of
whom
cagliostro
has
spoken
to
us
with
so
much
respect
and
admiration
this
altotas
was
not
an
imaginary
personage
the
inquisition
of
rome
has
collected
many
proofs
of
his
existence
without
having
been
able
to
discover
when
it
began
or
ended
for
altotas
disappears
or
rather
vanishes
like
a
meteor
which
according
to
the
poetic
fancy
of
romancers
would
authorize
us
in
declaring
him
immortal
it
is
curious
to
notice
that
modern
occultists
whilst
attributing
so
much
importance
to
and
the
legend
of
his
immortality
make
no
mention
of
altotas
who
appears
to
have
been
a
great
deal
more
remarkable
but
again
we
must
remember
it
is
the
unvarying
rule
of
secret
societies
that
the
real
authors
never
show
themselves
if
then
kölmer
was
the
same
person
as
altotas
he
would
appear
not
to
have
been
a
jew
or
a
cabalist
but
an
initiate
of
some
near
eastern
secret
society
possibly
an
ismaili
lecouteulx
de
canteleu
describes
altotas
as
an
armenian
and
says
that
his
system
was
derived
from
those
of
egypt
syria
and
persia
this
would
accord
with
barruel
statement
that
kölmer
came
from
egypt
and
that
his
ideas
were
founded
on
manichæism
it
would
be
necessary
to
set
these
statements
aside
as
only
the
theories
of
barruel
or
lecouteulx
were
it
not
that
the
writings
of
the
illuminati
betray
the
influence
of
some
sect
akin
to
manichæism
thus
spartacus
writes
to
cato
that
he
is
thinking
of
warming
up
the
old
system
of
the
ghebers
and
parsees
and
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
ghebers
were
one
of
the
sects
in
which
dozy
relates
that
abdullah
ibn
maymūn
found
his
true
supporters
later
weishaupt
goes
on
to
explain
that
the
allegory
in
which
the
mysteries
and
higher
grades
must
be
clothed
is
fire
worship
and
the
whole
philosophy
of
zoroaster
or
of
the
old
parsees
who
nowadays
only
remain
in
india
therefore
in
the
further
degrees
the
order
is
called
fire
worship
the
fire
order
or
the
persian
order
that
is
something
magnificent
beyond
all
expectation
at
the
same
time
the
persian
calendar
was
adopted
by
the
illuminati
it
is
evident
that
this
pretence
of
zoroastrianism
was
as
pure
humbug
as
weishaupt
later
pretence
of
christianity
of
the
true
doctrines
of
zoroaster
he
shows
no
conception
nor
does
he
insist
further
on
the
point
but
the
above
passage
would
certainly
lend
colour
to
the
theory
that
his
system
was
partly
founded
on
manichæism
that
is
to
say
on
perverted
zoroastrianism
imparted
to
him
by
a
man
from
the
east
and
that
the
methods
of
the
batinis
and
fatimites
may
have
been
communicated
to
him
through
the
same
channel
hence
the
extraordinary
resemblance
between
his
plan
of
organization
and
that
of
abdullah
ibn
maymūn
which
consisted
in
political
intriguing
rather
than
in
esoteric
speculation
thus
in
weishaupt
system
the
phraseology
of
judaism
the
cabalistic
legends
of
freemasonry
the
mystical
imaginings
of
the
martinistes
play
at
first
no
part
at
all
for
all
forms
of
theosophy
occultism
spiritualism
and
magic
weishaupt
expresses
nothing
but
contempt
and
the
masons
are
bracketed
with
the
jesuits
by
the
illuminati
as
enemies
it
is
necessary
to
outwit
at
every
turn
consequently
no
degree
of
finds
a
place
in
system
as
in
all
the
other
masonic
orders
of
the
day
which
drew
their
influence
from
eastern
or
cabalistic
sources
it
is
true
that
mysteries
play
a
great
part
in
the
phraseology
of
the
order
greater
and
lesser
mysteries
borrowed
from
ancient
egypt
whilst
the
higher
initiates
are
decorated
with
such
titles
as
epopte
and
hierophant
taken
from
the
eleusinian
mysteries
yet
weishaupt
own
theories
appear
to
bear
no
relation
whatever
to
these
ancient
cults
on
the
contrary
the
more
we
penetrate
into
his
system
the
more
apparent
it
becomes
that
all
the
formulas
he
employs
which
derive
from
any
religious
source
whether
persian
egyptian
or
christian
merely
serve
to
disguise
a
purely
material
purpose
a
plan
for
destroying
the
existing
order
of
society
thus
all
that
was
really
ancient
in
illuminism
was
the
destructive
spirit
that
animated
it
and
also
the
method
of
organization
it
had
imported
from
the
east
illuminism
therefore
marks
an
entirely
new
departure
in
the
history
of
european
secret
societies
weishaupt
himself
indicates
this
as
one
of
the
great
secrets
of
the
order
above
all
he
writes
to
cato
alias
zwack
guard
the
origin
and
the
novelty
of
in
the
most
careful
way
the
greatest
mystery
he
says
again
must
be
that
the
thing
is
new
the
fewer
who
know
this
the
better
not
one
of
the
eichstadters
knows
this
but
would
live
or
die
for
it
that
the
thing
is
as
old
as
methuselah
this
pretence
of
having
discovered
some
fund
of
ancient
wisdom
is
the
invariable
ruse
of
secret
society
adepts
the
one
thing
never
admitted
is
the
identity
of
the
individuals
from
whom
one
is
receiving
direction
weishaupt
himself
declares
that
he
has
got
it
all
out
of
books
by
means
of
arduous
and
unremitting
labour
what
it
costs
me
to
read
study
think
write
cross
out
and
he
complains
to
marius
and
cato
thus
according
to
weishaupt
the
whole
system
is
the
work
of
his
own
unaided
genius
and
the
supreme
direction
remains
in
his
hands
alone
again
and
again
he
insists
on
this
point
in
his
correspondence
if
this
were
indeed
the
case
weishaupt
in
view
of
the
efficiency
achieved
by
the
order
must
have
been
a
genius
of
the
first
water
and
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
so
remarkable
a
man
should
not
have
distinguished
himself
on
other
lines
but
have
remained
almost
unknown
to
posterity
it
would
therefore
appear
possible
that
weishaupt
although
undoubtedly
a
man
of
immense
organizing
capacity
and
endowed
with
extraofdinary
subtlety
was
not
in
reality
the
sole
author
of
illuminism
but
one
of
a
group
which
recognizing
his
talents
and
the
value
of
his
untiring
activity
placed
the
direction
in
his
hands
let
us
examine
this
hypothesis
in
the
light
of
a
document
which
was
unknown
to
me
when
i
wrote
my
former
account
of
the
illuminati
barruel
has
pointed
out
that
the
great
error
of
robison
was
to
describe
illuminism
as
arising
out
of
freemasonry
since
weishaupt
did
not
become
a
freemason
until
after
he
had
founded
his
order
it
is
true
that
weishaupt
was
not
officially
received
into
freemasonry
until
when
he
was
initiated
into
the
first
degree
at
the
lodge
theodore
de
bon
conseil
at
munich
from
this
time
we
find
him
continually
occupied
in
trying
to
discover
more
about
the
secrets
of
freemasonry
whilst
himself
claiming
superior
knowledge
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
an
inner
circle
of
the
lodge
theodore
may
not
have
been
first
in
the
field
and
weishaupt
all
the
while
an
unconscious
agent
a
very
curious
light
is
thrown
on
this
question
by
the
of
mirabeau
now
in
french
and
again
in
i
quoted
the
generally
received
opinion
that
mirabeau
who
was
already
a
freemason
was
received
into
the
order
of
the
illuminati
during
his
visit
to
berlin
in
to
this
waite
replied
all
that
is
said
about
mirabeau
his
visit
to
berlin
and
his
plot
to
french
freemasonry
may
be
disposed
of
in
one
sentence
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
that
mirabeau
ever
became
a
mason
the
province
of
barruel
was
to
colour
everything
waite
statement
may
also
be
disposed
of
in
one
sentence
it
is
a
pure
invention
the
province
of
waite
is
to
deny
everything
inconvenient
to
him
the
evidence
that
mirabeau
was
a
freemason
does
not
rest
on
barruel
alone
barthou
in
his
life
of
mirabeau
refers
to
it
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
and
relates
that
a
paper
was
found
at
mirabeau
house
describing
a
new
order
to
be
grafted
on
freemasonry
this
document
will
be
found
in
its
entirety
in
the
of
mirabeau
where
it
is
stated
that
mirabeau
had
early
entered
an
association
of
freemasonry
this
affiliation
had
accredited
him
to
a
dutch
lodge
and
it
seems
that
either
spontaneously
or
in
response
to
a
request
he
thought
of
proposing
an
organization
of
which
we
possess
the
plan
written
not
by
his
hand
but
by
the
hand
of
a
copyist
whom
mirabeau
had
attached
to
himself
this
work
appears
to
have
been
that
of
mirabeau
all
his
opinions
his
principles
and
his
style
will
be
found
here
the
same
work
goes
on
to
print
the
document
in
full
which
is
headed
memoir
concerning
an
intimate
association
to
be
established
in
the
order
of
freemasonry
so
as
to
bring
it
back
to
its
true
principles
and
to
make
it
really
tend
to
the
good
of
humanity
drawn
up
by
the
mi
at
present
named
arcesilas
in
as
this
memoir
is
too
long
to
reproduce
in
full
here
will
serve
to
give
an
idea
of
its
contents
he
mirabeau
was
a
freemason
from
his
youth
there
was
found
amongst
his
papers
written
by
the
hand
of
a
copyist
an
international
organization
of
freemasonry
which
no
doubt
he
dictated
in
amsterdam
this
project
contains
on
the
solidarity
of
men
on
the
benefits
of
instruction
and
on
the
correction
of
the
system
of
governments
and
of
legislations
views
very
superior
to
those
of
the
essay
on
despotism
the
mind
of
mirabeau
had
ripened
the
duties
he
traces
out
for
the
brothers
of
the
higher
grade
constitute
even
a
whole
plan
of
reforms
which
resemble
very
much
in
certain
parts
the
work
accomplished
later
by
the
constituent
assembly
suppression
of
servitudes
on
the
land
and
the
rights
of
main
morte
abolition
of
the
corvées
of
working
guilds
and
of
maîtrises
freedom
of
companies
of
customs
and
excise
duties
the
diminution
of
taxation
liberty
of
religious
opinions
and
of
the
press
the
disappearance
of
special
jurisdiction
in
order
to
organize
to
develop
and
arrive
at
his
end
mirabeau
invokes
the
example
of
the
jesuits
we
have
quite
contrary
views
he
says
that
of
enlightening
men
of
making
them
free
and
happy
but
we
must
and
we
can
do
this
by
the
same
means
and
who
should
prevent
us
doing
for
good
what
the
jesuits
have
done
for
evil
now
in
this
memoir
mirabeau
makes
no
mention
of
weishaupt
but
in
his
de
la
monarchic
he
gives
a
eulogistic
account
of
the
bavarian
illuminati
referring
to
weishaupt
by
name
and
showing
the
order
to
have
arisen
out
of
freemasonry
it
will
be
seen
that
this
account
corresponds
point
by
point
with
the
memoir
he
had
himself
made
out
in
that
is
to
say
in
the
very
year
that
illuminism
was
founded
the
lodge
theodore
de
bon
conseil
at
munich
where
there
were
a
few
men
with
brains
and
hearts
was
tired
of
being
tossed
about
by
the
vain
promises
and
quarrels
of
masonry
the
heads
resolved
to
graft
on
to
their
branch
another
secret
association
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
the
order
of
the
illuminés
they
modelled
it
on
the
society
of
jesus
whilst
proposing
to
themselves
views
diametrically
opposed
mirabeau
then
goes
on
to
say
that
the
great
object
of
the
order
was
the
amelioration
of
the
present
system
of
government
and
legislation
that
one
of
its
fundamental
rules
was
to
admit
no
prince
whatever
his
virtues
that
it
proposed
to
abolish
the
slavery
of
the
peasants
the
servitude
of
men
to
the
soil
the
rights
of
main
morte
and
all
the
customs
and
privileges
which
abase
humanity
the
corvées
under
the
condition
of
an
equitable
equivalent
all
the
corporations
all
the
maîtrises
all
the
burdens
imposed
on
industry
and
commerce
by
customs
excise
duties
and
taxes
to
procure
a
universal
toleration
for
all
religious
opinions
to
take
away
all
the
arms
of
superstition
to
favour
the
liberty
of
the
press
etc
from
all
this
we
see
then
that
mirabeau
did
not
become
an
illuminatus
in
as
i
had
supposed
before
this
document
was
known
to
me
but
had
been
in
the
order
from
the
beginning
apparently
as
one
of
its
founders
first
under
the
illuminated
name
of
arcesilas
and
later
under
that
of
leonidas
the
memoir
found
at
his
house
was
thus
no
other
than
the
programme
of
the
illuminati
evolved
by
him
in
collaboration
with
an
inner
ring
of
freemasons
belonging
to
the
lodge
theodore
the
correspondence
of
the
illuminati
in
fact
contains
several
references
to
an
inner
ring
under
the
name
of
the
secret
chapter
of
the
lodge
of
theodore
which
after
his
initiation
into
masonry
weishaupt
indicates
the
necessity
of
bringing
entirely
under
the
control
of
illuminism
it
is
probable
that
weishaupt
was
in
touch
with
this
secret
chapter
before
his
formal
admission
to
the
lodge
whether
then
the
ideas
of
illuminism
arose
in
this
secret
chapter
of
the
lodge
theodore
independently
of
weishaupt
or
whether
they
were
imparted
by
weishaupt
to
the
lodge
theodore
after
the
directions
had
been
given
him
by
kölmer
it
is
impossible
to
know
but
in
either
case
there
would
be
some
justification
for
robison
assertion
that
illuminism
arose
out
of
freemasonry
or
rather
that
it
took
birth
amongst
a
group
of
freemasons
whose
aims
were
not
those
of
the
order
in
general
what
were
these
aims
a
plan
of
social
and
political
reform
which
as
barthou
points
out
much
resembled
the
work
accomplished
later
by
the
constituent
assembly
in
france
this
admission
is
of
great
importance
in
other
words
the
programme
carried
out
by
the
constituent
assembly
in
had
been
largely
formulated
in
a
lodge
of
german
freemasons
who
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
illuminati
in
and
yet
we
are
told
that
illuminism
had
no
influence
on
the
french
revolution
it
will
be
objected
that
the
reforms
here
indicated
were
wholly
admirable
true
the
abolition
of
the
of
and
of
servitudes
were
measures
that
met
with
the
approval
of
all
men
including
the
king
of
france
himself
but
what
of
the
abolition
of
the
working
guilds
and
all
the
corporations
that
is
to
say
the
trade
unions
of
the
period
which
was
carried
out
by
the
infamous
loi
chapelier
in
a
decree
that
is
now
generally
recognized
as
one
of
the
strangest
anomalies
of
the
revolution
again
to
whose
interest
was
it
to
do
away
with
the
customs
and
excise
duties
of
france
to
establish
the
absolute
and
unfettered
liberty
of
the
press
and
religious
opinions
the
benefits
these
measures
might
be
expected
to
confer
on
the
french
people
were
certainly
problematical
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
their
utility
to
men
who
like
frederick
the
great
wished
to
ruin
france
and
to
break
the
alliance
by
the
unrestricted
circulation
of
libels
against
marie
antoinette
who
like
mirabeau
hoped
to
bring
about
a
revolution
or
who
like
voltaire
wished
to
remove
all
obstacles
to
the
spread
of
an
propaganda
it
is
therefore
by
no
means
impossible
that
weishaupt
was
at
first
the
agent
of
more
experienced
conspirators
whose
purely
political
aims
were
disguised
under
a
plan
of
social
reform
and
who
saw
in
the
bavarian
professor
a
clever
organizer
to
be
employed
in
carrying
out
their
designs
whether
this
was
so
or
not
the
fact
remains
that
from
the
time
weishaupt
assumed
control
of
the
order
the
plan
of
social
reform
described
by
mirabeau
vanishes
entirely
for
not
a
word
do
we
find
in
the
writings
of
the
illuminati
about
any
pretended
scheme
for
ameliorating
the
lot
of
the
people
and
illuminism
becomes
simply
a
scheme
of
anarchic
philosophy
the
french
historian
henri
martin
has
thus
admirably
summed
up
the
system
elaborated
by
spartacus
weishaupt
had
made
into
an
absolute
theory
the
misanthropic
gibes
boutades
of
rousseau
at
the
invention
of
property
and
society
and
without
taking
into
account
the
statement
so
distinctly
formulated
by
rousseau
on
the
impossibility
of
suppressing
property
and
society
once
they
had
been
established
he
proposed
as
the
end
of
illuminism
the
abolition
of
property
social
authority
of
nationality
and
the
return
of
the
human
race
to
the
happy
state
in
which
it
formed
only
a
single
family
without
artificial
needs
without
useless
sciences
every
father
being
priest
and
magistrate
priest
of
we
know
not
what
religion
for
in
spite
of
their
frequent
invocations
of
the
god
of
nature
many
indications
lead
us
to
conclude
that
weishaupt
had
like
diderot
and
no
other
god
than
nature
herself
from
his
doctrine
would
naturally
follow
the
german
and
the
system
of
anarchy
recently
developed
in
france
of
which
the
physiognomy
suggests
a
foreign
origin
this
summary
of
the
aims
of
the
illuminati
which
absolutely
corroborates
the
view
of
barruel
and
robison
is
confirmed
in
detail
by
the
socialist
freethinker
of
the
nineteenth
century
louis
blanc
who
in
his
remarkable
chapter
on
the
révolutionnaires
mystiques
refers
to
weishaupt
as
one
of
the
profoundest
conspirators
who
have
ever
existed
george
sand
also
socialist
and
of
the
freemasons
wrote
of
the
european
conspiracy
of
illuminism
and
the
immense
influence
exercised
by
the
secret
societies
of
mystic
germany
to
say
then
that
barruel
and
robison
were
alone
in
proclaiming
the
danger
of
illuminism
is
simply
a
deliberate
perversion
of
the
truth
and
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
english
freemasons
should
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
misled
on
this
question
thus
the
observes
that
the
illuminati
were
as
a
rule
men
of
the
strictest
morality
and
humanity
and
the
ideas
they
sought
to
instil
were
those
which
have
found
universal
acceptance
in
our
own
times
preston
in
his
of
also
does
his
best
to
gloss
over
the
faults
of
the
order
and
even
the
historian
of
freemasonry
devotes
to
its
founder
this
astounding
apology
after
describing
weishaupt
as
the
victim
of
jesuit
intrigue
gould
goes
on
to
say
he
conceived
the
idea
of
combating
his
foes
with
their
own
weapons
and
forming
a
society
of
young
men
enthusiastic
in
the
cause
of
humanity
who
should
gradually
be
trained
to
work
as
one
man
to
one
end
the
destruction
of
evil
and
the
enhancement
of
good
in
this
world
unfortunately
he
had
unconsciously
imbibed
that
most
pernicious
doctrine
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
and
his
whole
plan
reveals
the
effects
of
his
youthful
teaching
the
man
himself
was
without
guile
ignorant
of
men
knowing
them
only
by
books
a
learned
professor
an
enthusiast
who
took
a
wrong
course
in
all
innocence
and
the
faults
of
his
head
have
been
heavily
visited
upon
his
memory
in
spite
of
the
rare
qualities
of
his
heart
one
can
only
conclude
that
these
extraordinary
exonerations
of
an
order
bitterly
hostile
to
the
true
aims
of
masonry
proceed
from
ignorance
of
the
real
nature
of
illuminism
in
order
to
judge
of
this
it
is
only
necessary
to
consult
the
writings
of
the
illuminati
themselves
which
are
contained
in
the
following
works
originalschriften
des
munich
von
weitern
originalschriften
munich
neuesten
arbeiten
des
spartacus
und
philo
in
dem
munich
all
these
consist
in
the
correspondence
and
papers
of
the
order
which
were
seized
by
the
bavarian
government
at
the
houses
of
two
of
the
members
zwack
and
bassus
and
published
by
order
of
the
elector
the
authenticity
of
these
documents
has
never
been
denied
even
by
the
illuminati
themselves
weishaupt
in
his
published
defence
endeavoured
only
to
explain
away
the
most
incriminating
passages
the
publishers
moreover
were
careful
to
state
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
volume
those
who
might
have
any
doubts
on
the
authenticity
of
this
collection
may
present
themselves
at
the
secret
archives
here
where
on
request
the
original
documents
will
be
laid
before
them
this
precaution
rendered
all
dispute
impossible
setting
barruel
and
robison
entirely
aside
we
shall
now
see
from
the
evidence
of
their
own
writings
how
far
the
illuminati
can
be
regarded
as
a
praiseworthy
and
cruelly
maligned
order
let
us
begin
with
their
attitude
towards
freemasonry
illuminism
and
freemasonry
from
the
moment
of
weishaupt
admission
into
freemasonry
his
whole
conduct
was
a
violation
of
the
masonic
code
instead
of
proceeding
after
the
recognized
manner
by
successive
stages
of
initiation
he
set
himself
to
find
out
further
secrets
by
underhand
methods
and
then
to
turn
them
to
the
advantage
of
his
own
system
thus
about
a
year
after
his
initiation
he
writes
to
cato
alias
zwack
i
have
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
profound
glimpse
into
the
secret
of
the
freemasons
i
know
their
whole
aim
and
shall
impart
it
all
at
the
right
time
in
one
of
the
higher
degrees
cato
is
then
deputed
to
make
further
discoveries
through
an
italian
freemason
the
abbé
marotti
which
he
records
triumphantly
in
his
diary
interview
with
the
abbé
marotti
on
the
question
of
masonry
when
he
explained
to
me
the
whole
secret
which
is
founded
on
old
religion
and
church
history
and
imparted
to
me
all
the
higher
degrees
up
to
the
scottish
informed
spartacus
of
this
spartacus
however
unimpressed
by
this
communication
replied
drily
whether
you
know
the
aim
of
masonry
i
doubt
i
have
myself
included
an
insight
into
this
structure
in
my
plan
but
reserved
it
for
later
degrees
weishaupt
then
decides
that
all
illuminated
areopagites
shall
take
the
first
three
degrees
of
freemasonry
but
further
that
we
shall
have
a
masonic
lodge
of
our
own
that
we
shall
regard
this
as
our
nursery
garden
that
to
some
of
these
masons
we
shall
not
at
once
reveal
that
we
have
something
more
than
the
masons
have
that
at
every
opportunity
we
shall
cover
ourselves
with
this
masonry
all
those
who
are
not
suited
to
the
work
shall
remain
in
the
masonic
lodge
and
advance
in
that
without
knowing
anything
of
the
further
system
we
shall
find
this
plan
of
an
inner
secret
circle
concealed
within
freemasonry
persisting
up
to
our
own
day
weishaupt
however
admits
himself
puzzled
with
regard
to
the
past
of
masonry
and
urges
porcius
to
find
out
more
on
this
question
from
the
abbé
marotti
see
whether
through
him
you
can
discover
the
real
history
origin
and
the
first
founders
of
masonry
for
on
this
alone
i
am
still
undecided
but
it
is
in
philo
the
baron
von
knigge
a
freemason
and
member
of
the
stride
observance
in
which
he
was
known
as
the
eques
a
cygno
that
weishaupt
finds
his
most
efficient
investigator
thus
philo
writes
to
spartacus
i
have
now
found
in
cassel
the
best
man
on
whom
i
can
not
congratulate
ourselves
enough
he
is
mauvillon
grand
master
of
one
of
the
royal
york
lodges
so
with
him
we
have
the
whole
lodge
in
our
hands
he
has
also
got
from
there
all
their
miserable
degrees
hat
auch
von
dort
aus
alle
ihre
elenden
no
wonder
that
weishaupt
thereupon
exclaims
joyfully
philo
does
more
than
we
all
expected
and
he
is
the
man
who
alone
will
carry
it
all
through
weishaupt
then
occupies
himself
in
trying
to
get
a
constitution
from
london
evidently
without
success
and
also
in
wresting
the
lodge
theodore
in
munich
from
the
control
of
berlin
in
order
to
substitute
his
own
domination
so
that
the
whole
secret
chapter
will
be
subjected
to
our
leave
everything
to
it
and
await
further
degrees
from
it
alone
in
all
this
weishaupt
shows
himself
not
only
an
intriguer
but
a
charlatan
inventing
mysteries
and
degrees
to
impose
on
the
credulity
of
his
followers
the
mysteries
or
secret
truths
are
the
finest
of
all
he
writes
to
philipo
strozzi
and
give
me
much
trouble
so
whilst
heartily
despising
freemasonry
theosophy
rosicrucianism
and
mysticism
of
every
kind
his
association
with
philo
leads
him
to
perceive
the
utility
of
all
these
as
a
bait
and
he
allows
philo
to
draw
up
plans
for
a
degree
of
scottish
knight
but
the
result
is
pitiable
philo
composition
a
discourse
and
explanation
of
hieroglyphics
is
characterized
by
weishaupt
as
gibberish
philo
he
says
again
is
full
of
such
follies
which
betray
his
small
mind
on
the
illuminatus
major
follows
the
miserable
degree
of
scottish
knight
entirely
of
his
composition
and
on
the
degree
of
priest
an
equally
miserable
degree
of
regent
but
i
have
already
composed
four
more
degrees
compared
to
the
worst
of
which
the
priest
degree
will
be
child
play
but
i
shall
tell
no
one
about
it
till
i
see
how
the
thing
goes
the
perfidy
of
the
illuminati
with
regard
to
the
freemasons
is
therefore
apparent
even
mounier
who
set
out
to
refute
barruel
on
the
strength
of
the
information
supplied
to
him
by
the
illuminatus
bode
admits
their
duplicity
in
this
respect
weishaupt
says
mounier
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
hanoverian
the
baron
von
knigge
a
famous
intriguer
long
practised
in
the
charlatanism
of
lodges
of
freemasons
on
his
advice
new
degrees
were
added
to
the
old
ones
and
it
was
resolved
to
profit
by
freemasonry
whilst
profoundly
despising
it
they
decided
that
the
degrees
of
entered
apprentice
fellow
craft
master
mason
and
scotch
knight
should
be
added
to
those
of
the
illuminati
and
that
they
would
boast
of
possessing
exclusively
the
real
secrets
of
the
freemasons
and
affirm
that
illuminism
was
the
real
primitive
freemasonry
the
papers
of
the
order
seized
in
bavaria
and
published
mounier
says
again
show
that
the
illuminati
employed
the
forms
of
freemasonry
but
that
they
considered
it
in
itself
apart
from
their
own
degrees
as
a
puerile
absurdity
and
that
they
detested
the
mounier
as
a
good
disciple
of
bode
takes
much
the
same
view
and
pities
the
of
the
freemasons
who
like
so
many
children
spend
a
great
part
of
the
time
in
their
lodges
playing
at
chapel
why
in
the
face
of
all
this
should
any
british
masons
take
up
the
cudgels
for
the
illuminati
and
vilify
robison
and
barruel
for
exposing
them
the
american
mackey
as
a
consistent
freemason
shows
scant
sympathy
for
this
traitor
in
the
masonic
camp
weishaupt
he
writes
was
a
radical
in
politics
and
an
infidel
in
religion
and
he
organized
this
association
not
more
for
the
purpose
of
aggrandizing
himself
than
of
overturning
christianity
and
the
institutions
of
society
and
in
a
footnote
he
adds
that
robison
of
a
contain
a
very
excellent
exposition
of
the
nature
of
this
institution
the
truth
is
that
weishaupt
was
one
of
the
greatest
enemies
of
british
freemasonry
who
ever
lived
and
genuine
freemasons
will
do
themselves
no
good
by
defending
him
or
his
abominable
system
let
us
now
see
how
far
apart
from
their
rôle
in
masonry
the
illuminati
can
be
regarded
as
noble
idealists
striving
for
the
welfare
of
the
human
race
idealism
of
the
illuminati
the
line
of
defence
adopted
by
the
apologists
of
the
illuminati
is
always
to
quote
the
admirable
principles
professed
by
the
order
the
beautiful
ideas
that
run
through
their
writings
and
to
show
what
excellent
people
were
to
be
found
amongst
them
of
course
on
their
face
value
the
illuminati
appear
wholly
admirable
of
course
there
is
nothing
easier
than
to
find
innumerable
passages
in
their
writings
breathing
a
spirit
of
the
loftiest
aspiration
and
of
course
many
excellent
men
figured
amongst
the
patrons
of
the
order
all
this
is
the
mere
of
the
secret
society
leader
as
of
the
fraudulent
company
promoter
to
whom
the
first
essentials
are
a
glowing
prospectus
and
a
long
list
of
highly
respectable
patrons
who
know
nothing
whatever
about
the
inner
workings
of
the
concern
these
methods
pursued
as
early
as
the
ninth
century
by
abdullah
ibn
maymūn
enter
largely
into
the
policy
of
frederick
the
great
voltaire
and
his
brothers
in
philosophy
or
in
freemasonry
the
resemblances
between
weishaupt
correspondence
and
that
of
voltaire
and
of
frederick
the
great
are
certainly
very
striking
all
at
moments
profess
respect
for
christianity
whilst
working
to
destroy
it
thus
just
as
voltaire
in
one
letter
to
expresses
his
horror
at
the
publication
of
an
pamphlet
testament
de
jean
meslier
and
in
another
urges
him
to
have
it
circulated
in
thousands
all
over
france
so
weishaupt
is
careful
in
general
to
exhibit
the
face
of
a
benign
philosopher
and
even
of
a
christian
evangelist
it
is
only
at
moments
that
he
drops
the
mask
and
reveals
the
grinning
satyr
behind
it
accordingly
in
the
published
statutes
of
the
illuminati
no
hint
of
subversive
intentions
will
be
found
indeed
the
obligation
expressly
states
that
nothing
against
the
state
religion
or
morals
is
undertaken
yet
what
is
weishaupt
real
political
theory
no
other
than
that
of
modern
anarchy
that
man
should
govern
himself
and
rulers
should
be
gradually
done
away
with
but
he
is
careful
to
deprecate
all
ideas
of
violent
revolution
the
process
is
to
be
accomplished
by
the
most
peaceful
methods
let
us
see
how
gently
he
leads
up
to
the
final
conclusion
the
first
stage
in
the
life
of
the
whole
human
race
is
savagery
rough
nature
in
which
the
family
is
the
only
society
and
hunger
and
thirst
are
easily
satisfied
in
which
man
enjoys
the
two
most
excellent
goods
equality
and
liberty
to
their
fullest
extent
in
these
circumstances
health
was
his
usual
condition
happy
men
who
were
not
yet
enough
enlightened
to
lose
their
peace
of
mind
and
to
be
conscious
of
the
unhappy
mainsprings
and
causes
of
our
misery
love
of
power
envy
illnesses
and
all
the
results
of
imagination
the
manner
in
which
man
fell
from
this
primitive
state
of
felicity
is
then
described
as
families
increased
means
of
subsistence
began
to
lack
the
nomadic
life
ceased
property
was
instituted
men
established
themselves
firmly
and
through
agriculture
families
drew
near
each
other
thereby
language
developed
and
through
living
together
men
began
to
measure
themselves
against
each
other
etc
but
here
was
the
cause
of
the
downfall
of
freedom
equality
vanished
man
felt
new
unknown
needs
thus
men
became
dependent
like
minors
under
the
guardianship
of
kings
the
human
must
attain
its
majority
and
become
why
should
it
be
impossible
that
the
human
race
should
attain
to
its
highest
perfection
the
capacity
to
guide
itself
why
should
anyone
be
eternally
led
who
understands
how
to
lead
himself
further
men
must
learn
not
only
to
be
independent
of
kings
but
of
each
other
who
has
need
of
another
depends
on
him
and
has
resigned
his
rights
so
to
need
little
is
the
first
step
to
freedom
therefore
savages
and
the
most
highly
enlightened
are
perhaps
the
only
free
men
the
art
of
more
and
more
limiting
one
needs
is
at
the
same
time
the
art
of
attaining
freedom
weishaupt
then
goes
on
to
show
how
the
further
evil
of
patriotism
arose
with
the
origin
of
nations
and
peoples
the
world
ceased
to
be
a
great
family
a
single
kingdom
the
great
tie
of
nature
was
torn
nationalism
took
the
place
of
human
love
now
it
became
a
virtue
to
magnify
one
fatherland
at
the
expense
of
whoever
was
not
enclosed
within
its
limits
now
as
a
means
to
this
narrow
end
it
was
allowed
to
despise
and
outwit
foreigners
or
indeed
even
to
insult
them
this
virtue
was
called
patriotism
and
so
by
narrowing
down
affection
to
one
the
members
of
one
family
and
even
to
oneself
there
arose
out
of
patriotism
localism
the
family
spirit
and
finally
egoism
diminish
patriotism
then
men
will
learn
to
know
each
other
again
as
such
their
dependence
on
each
other
will
be
lost
the
bond
of
union
will
widen
out
it
will
be
seen
that
the
whole
of
weishaupt
theory
was
in
reality
a
new
rendering
of
the
ancient
secret
tradition
relating
to
the
fall
of
man
and
the
loss
of
his
primitive
felicity
but
whilst
the
ancient
religions
taught
the
hope
of
a
redeemer
who
should
restore
man
to
his
former
state
weishaupt
looks
to
man
alone
for
his
restoration
men
he
observes
no
longer
loved
men
but
only
such
and
such
men
the
word
was
quite
lost
thus
in
weishaupt
masonic
system
the
lost
word
is
man
and
its
recovery
is
interpreted
by
the
idea
that
man
should
find
himself
again
further
on
weishaupt
goes
on
to
show
how
the
redemption
of
the
human
race
is
to
be
brought
about
these
means
are
secret
schools
of
wisdom
these
were
from
all
time
the
archives
of
nature
and
of
human
rights
through
them
will
man
be
saved
from
his
fall
princes
and
nations
will
disappear
without
violence
from
the
earth
the
human
race
will
become
one
family
and
the
world
the
abode
of
reasonable
men
morality
alone
will
bring
about
this
change
imperceptibly
every
father
of
a
family
will
be
as
formerly
abraham
and
the
patriarchs
the
priest
and
unfettered
lord
of
his
family
and
reason
will
be
the
only
code
of
man
this
is
one
of
our
greatest
secrets
but
whilst
completely
eliminating
any
idea
of
divine
power
outside
man
and
framing
his
system
on
purely
political
lines
weishaupt
is
careful
not
to
shock
the
susceptibilities
of
his
followers
by
any
open
repudiation
of
christian
doctrines
on
the
contrary
he
invokes
christ
at
every
turn
and
sometimes
even
in
language
so
apparently
earnest
and
even
beautiful
that
one
is
almost
tempted
to
believe
in
his
sincerity
thus
he
writes
this
our
great
and
unforgettable
master
jesus
of
nazareth
appeared
at
a
time
in
the
world
when
it
was
sunk
in
depravity
the
first
followers
of
his
teaching
are
not
wise
men
but
simple
chosen
from
the
lowest
class
of
the
people
so
as
to
show
that
his
teaching
should
be
possible
and
comprehensible
to
all
classes
and
conditions
of
men
he
carries
out
this
teaching
by
means
of
the
most
blameless
life
in
conformity
with
it
and
seals
and
confirms
this
with
his
blood
and
death
these
laws
which
he
shows
as
the
way
to
salvation
are
only
two
love
of
god
and
love
of
one
neighbour
more
he
asks
of
no
one
so
far
no
lutheran
pastor
could
have
expressed
himself
better
but
one
must
study
weishaupt
writings
as
a
whole
to
apprehend
the
true
measure
of
his
belief
in
christ
teaching
now
as
we
have
already
seen
his
first
idea
was
to
make
fire
worship
the
religion
of
illuminism
the
profession
of
christianity
therefore
appears
to
have
been
an
evidently
weishaupt
discovered
as
others
have
done
that
christianity
lends
itself
more
readily
to
subversive
ideas
than
any
other
religion
and
in
the
passages
which
follow
we
find
him
adopting
the
old
ruse
of
representing
christ
as
a
communist
and
as
a
adept
thus
he
goes
on
to
explain
that
if
jesus
preaches
contempt
of
riches
he
wishes
to
teach
us
the
reasonable
use
of
them
and
prepare
for
the
community
of
goods
introduced
by
him
and
in
which
weishaupt
adds
later
he
lived
with
his
disciples
but
this
secret
doctrine
is
only
to
be
apprehended
by
initiates
no
one
has
so
cleverly
concealed
the
high
meaning
of
his
teaching
and
no
one
finally
has
so
surely
and
easily
directed
men
on
to
the
path
of
freedom
as
our
great
master
jesus
of
nazareth
this
secret
meaning
and
natural
consequence
of
his
teaching
he
hid
completely
for
jesus
had
a
secret
doctrine
as
we
see
in
more
than
one
place
of
the
scriptures
weishaupt
thus
contrives
to
give
a
purely
political
interpretation
to
christ
teaching
the
secret
preserved
through
the
disciplinam
arcani
and
the
aim
appearing
through
all
his
words
and
deeds
is
to
give
back
to
men
their
original
liberty
and
equality
now
one
can
understand
how
far
jesus
was
the
redeemer
and
saviour
of
the
world
the
mission
of
christ
was
therefore
by
means
of
reason
to
make
men
capable
of
freedom
when
at
last
reason
becomes
the
religion
of
man
so
will
the
problem
be
solved
weishaupt
goes
on
to
show
that
freemasonry
can
be
interpreted
in
the
same
manner
the
secret
doctrine
concealed
in
the
teaching
of
christ
was
handed
down
by
initiates
who
hid
themselves
and
their
doctrine
under
the
cover
of
freemasonry
and
in
a
long
explanation
of
masonic
hieroglyphics
he
indicates
the
analogies
between
the
hiramic
legend
and
the
story
of
christ
i
say
then
hiram
is
christ
and
after
giving
one
of
his
reasons
for
this
assertion
adds
here
then
is
much
ground
gained
although
i
myself
can
not
help
laughing
at
this
explanation
ich
selbst
über
diese
explication
im
grund
lachen
weishaupt
then
proceeds
to
give
further
interpretations
of
his
own
devising
to
the
masonic
ritual
including
an
imaginary
translation
of
certain
words
supposed
to
be
derived
from
hebrew
and
ends
up
by
saying
one
will
be
able
to
show
several
more
resemblances
between
hiram
and
the
life
and
death
of
christ
or
drag
them
in
by
the
hair
so
much
for
weishaupt
respect
for
the
grand
legend
of
freemasonry
in
this
manner
weishaupt
demonstrates
that
freemasonry
is
hidden
christianity
at
least
my
explanations
of
the
hieroglyphics
fit
this
perfectly
and
in
the
way
in
which
i
explain
christianity
no
one
need
be
ashamed
to
be
a
christian
for
i
leave
the
name
and
substitute
for
it
reason
but
this
is
of
course
only
the
secret
of
what
weishaupt
calls
real
freemasonry
in
contradistinction
to
the
official
kind
which
he
regards
as
totally
unenlightened
had
not
the
noble
and
elect
remained
in
the
background
new
depravity
would
have
broken
out
in
the
human
race
and
through
regents
priests
and
freemasons
reason
would
have
been
banished
from
the
earth
in
weishaupt
masonic
system
therefore
the
designs
of
the
order
with
regard
to
religion
are
not
confided
to
the
mere
freemasons
but
only
to
the
illuminati
under
the
heading
of
higher
mysteries
weishaupt
writes
the
man
who
is
good
for
nothing
better
remains
a
scottish
knight
if
he
is
however
a
particularly
industrious
observer
worker
he
becomes
a
priest
if
there
are
amongst
these
priests
high
speculative
intellects
they
become
magi
these
collect
and
put
in
order
the
higher
philosophical
system
and
work
at
the
people
religion
which
the
order
will
next
give
to
the
world
should
these
high
geniuses
also
be
fit
to
rule
the
world
they
become
regents
this
is
the
last
degree
philo
the
baron
von
knigge
also
throws
an
interesting
light
on
the
religious
designs
of
the
illuminati
in
a
letter
to
cato
he
explains
the
necessity
of
devising
a
system
that
will
satisfy
fanatics
and
freethinkers
alike
so
as
to
work
on
both
these
classes
of
men
and
unite
them
we
must
find
an
explanation
to
the
christian
religion
make
this
the
secret
of
freemasonry
and
turn
it
to
our
purpose
philo
continues
we
say
then
jesus
wished
to
introduce
no
new
religion
but
only
to
restore
natural
religion
and
reason
to
their
old
rights
thereby
he
wished
to
unite
men
in
a
great
universal
association
and
through
the
spread
of
a
wiser
morality
enlightenment
and
the
combating
of
all
prejudices
to
make
them
capable
of
governing
themselves
so
the
secret
meaning
of
his
teaching
was
to
lead
men
without
revolution
to
universal
liberty
and
equality
there
are
many
passages
in
the
bible
which
can
be
made
use
of
and
explained
and
so
all
quarrelling
between
the
sects
ceases
if
one
can
find
a
reasonable
meaning
in
the
teaching
of
jesus
be
it
true
or
not
as
however
this
simple
religion
was
afterwards
distorted
so
were
these
teachings
imparted
to
us
through
disciplinam
arcani
and
finally
through
freemasonry
and
all
masonic
hieroglyphics
can
be
explained
with
this
object
spartacus
has
collected
very
good
data
for
this
and
i
have
myself
added
to
them
and
so
i
have
got
both
degrees
ready
now
therefore
that
people
see
that
we
are
the
only
real
and
true
christians
we
can
say
a
word
more
against
priests
and
princes
but
i
have
so
managed
that
after
previous
tests
i
can
receive
pontiffs
and
kings
in
this
degree
in
the
higher
mysteries
we
must
then
disclose
the
pious
fraud
and
reveal
from
all
writings
the
origin
of
all
religious
lies
and
their
connexion
so
admirably
did
this
ruse
succeed
that
we
find
spartacus
writing
triumphantly
you
can
not
imagine
what
consideration
and
sensation
our
degree
is
arousing
the
most
wonderful
thing
is
that
great
protestant
and
reformed
theologians
who
belong
to
illuminism
still
believe
that
the
religious
teaching
imparted
in
it
contains
the
true
and
genuine
spirit
of
the
christian
religion
oh
men
of
what
can
not
you
be
persuaded
i
never
thought
that
i
should
become
the
founder
of
a
new
religion
it
is
on
the
illuminized
clergy
and
professors
that
weishaupt
counts
principally
for
the
work
of
the
order
through
the
influence
of
the
brothers
he
writes
the
jesuits
have
been
removed
from
all
professorships
and
the
university
of
ingoldstadt
has
been
quite
cleansed
of
them
thus
the
way
is
cleared
for
weishaupt
adepts
the
institute
of
cadets
also
comes
under
the
control
of
the
order
all
the
professors
are
members
of
the
illuminati
so
will
all
the
pupils
become
disciples
of
illuminism
further
we
have
provided
our
clerical
members
with
good
benefices
parishes
posts
at
court
through
our
influence
arminius
and
cortez
have
been
made
professors
at
ephesus
the
german
schools
are
quite
under
the
influence
of
and
now
only
members
have
charge
of
them
the
charitable
association
is
also
directed
by
soon
we
shall
draw
over
to
us
the
whole
bartholomew
institute
for
young
clergymen
the
preparations
have
already
been
made
and
the
prospects
are
very
good
by
this
means
we
shall
be
able
to
provide
the
whole
of
bavaria
with
proper
priests
but
religion
and
freemasonry
are
not
the
only
means
by
which
illuminism
can
be
spread
we
must
consider
says
weishaupt
how
we
can
begin
to
work
under
another
form
if
only
the
aim
is
achieved
it
does
not
matter
under
what
cover
it
takes
place
and
a
cover
is
always
necessary
for
in
concealment
lies
a
great
part
of
our
strength
for
this
reason
we
must
always
cover
ourselves
with
the
name
of
another
society
the
lodges
that
are
under
freemasonry
are
in
the
meantime
the
most
suitable
cloak
for
our
high
purpose
because
the
world
is
already
accustomed
to
expect
nothing
great
from
them
which
merits
attention
as
in
the
spiritual
orders
of
the
roman
church
religion
was
alas
only
a
pretence
so
must
our
order
also
in
a
nobler
way
try
to
conceal
itself
behind
a
learned
society
or
something
of
the
kind
a
society
concealed
in
this
manner
can
not
be
worked
against
in
case
of
a
prosecution
or
of
treason
the
superiors
can
not
be
discovered
we
shall
be
shrouded
in
impenetrable
darkness
from
spies
and
emissaries
of
other
societies
in
order
to
give
a
good
appearance
to
the
order
weishaupt
particularly
indicates
the
necessity
for
enlisting
esteemed
and
respectable
persons
but
above
all
young
men
whom
he
regards
as
the
most
likely
subjects
i
can
not
use
men
as
they
are
he
observes
but
i
must
first
form
them
youth
naturally
lends
itself
best
to
this
process
seek
the
society
of
young
people
weishaupt
writes
to
ajax
watch
them
and
if
one
of
them
pleases
you
lay
your
hand
on
him
seek
out
young
and
already
skilful
people
our
people
must
be
engaging
enterprising
intriguing
and
adroit
above
all
the
first
if
possible
they
should
also
be
beautiful
people
such
people
have
generally
gentle
manners
a
tender
heart
and
are
when
well
practised
in
other
things
of
the
greatest
use
in
undertakings
for
their
first
glance
attracts
but
their
spirit
pas
la
profondeur
des
physiognomies
they
are
however
also
less
disposed
to
riots
and
disturbances
than
the
darker
physiognomies
that
is
why
one
must
know
how
to
use
people
above
all
the
high
soulful
eye
pleases
me
and
the
free
open
brow
with
these
novices
the
adept
of
illuminism
is
to
proceed
slowly
talking
backwards
and
forwards
one
must
speak
first
in
one
way
then
in
another
so
as
not
to
commit
oneself
and
to
make
one
real
way
of
thinking
impenetrable
to
one
inferiors
weishaupt
also
insists
on
the
importance
of
exciting
the
curiosity
and
then
drawing
back
again
after
the
manner
of
the
fatimite
i
have
no
fault
to
find
with
your
methods
of
reception
spartacus
writes
to
cato
except
that
they
are
too
quick
you
should
proceed
gradually
in
a
roundabout
way
by
means
of
suspense
and
expectations
so
as
first
to
arouse
indefinite
vague
curiosity
and
then
when
the
candidate
declares
himself
present
the
object
which
he
will
then
seize
with
both
hands
by
this
means
his
vanity
will
also
be
flattered
because
one
will
arouse
the
pleasure
of
knowing
something
which
everyone
does
not
know
and
about
which
the
greater
part
of
the
world
is
groping
in
darkness
for
the
same
reason
the
candidate
must
be
impressed
with
the
importance
of
secret
societies
and
the
part
they
have
played
in
the
destinies
of
the
world
one
illustrates
this
by
the
order
of
the
jesuits
of
the
freemasons
by
the
secret
associations
of
the
ancients
one
asserts
that
all
events
in
the
world
occur
from
a
hundred
secret
springs
and
causes
to
which
secret
associations
above
all
belong
one
arouses
the
pleasure
of
quiet
hidden
power
and
of
insight
into
hidden
secrets
at
this
point
one
is
to
begin
to
show
glimpses
and
to
let
fall
here
and
there
remarks
that
may
be
interpreted
in
two
ways
so
as
to
bring
the
candidate
to
the
point
of
saying
if
i
had
the
chance
to
enter
such
an
association
i
would
go
into
it
at
once
these
discourses
says
weishaupt
are
to
be
often
repeated
in
the
discourse
of
reception
to
the
illuminatus
dirigens
the
appeal
to
love
of
power
plays
the
most
important
part
do
you
realize
sufficiently
what
it
means
to
rule
to
rule
in
a
secret
society
not
only
over
the
lesser
or
more
important
of
the
populace
but
over
the
best
men
over
men
of
all
ranks
nations
and
religions
to
rule
without
external
force
to
unite
them
indissolubly
to
breathe
one
spirit
and
soul
into
them
men
distributed
over
all
parts
of
the
world
and
finally
do
you
know
what
secret
societies
are
what
a
place
they
occupy
in
the
great
kingdom
of
the
world
events
do
you
really
think
they
are
unimportant
transitory
appearances
etc
but
the
admission
of
political
aims
is
reserved
only
for
the
higher
grades
of
the
order
with
the
beginner
says
weishaupt
we
must
be
careful
about
books
on
religion
and
the
state
i
have
reserved
these
in
my
plan
for
the
higher
degrees
accordingly
the
discourse
to
the
minerval
is
expressly
designed
to
put
him
off
the
track
thus
the
initiator
is
to
say
to
him
after
two
years
reflection
experience
intercourse
reading
of
the
graduated
writings
and
information
you
will
necessarily
have
formed
the
idea
that
the
final
aim
of
our
society
is
nothing
less
than
to
win
power
and
riches
to
undermine
secular
or
religious
government
and
to
obtain
the
mastery
of
the
world
and
so
on
if
you
have
represented
our
society
to
yourself
from
this
point
of
view
or
have
entered
it
in
this
expectation
you
have
mightily
deceived
yourself
the
initiator
without
informing
the
minerval
of
the
real
aim
of
the
society
then
goes
on
to
say
that
he
is
now
free
to
leave
it
if
he
wishes
by
this
means
the
leaders
were
able
to
eliminate
ambitious
people
who
might
become
their
rivals
to
power
and
to
form
their
ranks
out
of
men
who
would
submit
to
be
led
blindly
onward
by
unseen
directors
my
circumstances
necessitate
spartacus
writes
to
cato
that
i
should
remain
hidden
from
most
of
the
members
as
long
as
i
live
i
am
obliged
to
do
everything
through
five
or
six
persons
so
carefully
was
this
secret
guarded
that
until
the
papers
of
the
illuminati
were
seized
in
no
one
outside
this
inner
circle
knew
that
weishaupt
was
the
head
of
the
order
yet
if
we
are
to
believe
his
own
assertions
he
had
been
throughout
in
supreme
control
again
and
again
he
impresses
on
his
the
necessity
for
unity
of
command
in
the
order
one
must
show
how
easy
it
would
be
for
one
clever
head
to
direct
hundreds
and
thousands
of
men
and
he
illustrates
this
system
by
the
table
reproduced
on
the
next
page
to
which
he
appends
the
following
explanation
i
have
two
immediately
below
me
into
whom
i
breathe
my
whole
spirit
and
each
of
these
two
has
again
two
others
and
so
on
in
this
way
i
can
set
a
thousand
men
in
motion
and
on
fire
in
the
simplest
manner
and
in
this
way
one
must
impart
orders
and
operate
on
politics
thus
as
in
the
case
of
abdullah
ibn
maymūn
society
the
extraordinary
result
was
brought
about
that
a
multitude
of
men
of
divers
beliefs
were
all
working
together
for
an
object
known
only
to
a
few
of
them
enough
has
now
been
quoted
from
the
correspondence
of
the
illuminati
to
show
their
aims
and
methods
according
to
their
own
admissions
we
shall
now
see
how
far
their
apologists
are
justified
in
describing
them
as
men
of
the
strictest
morality
and
humanity
doubtless
there
were
many
excellent
people
in
the
outer
ranks
of
the
order
but
this
is
not
the
contention
of
gould
who
expressly
states
that
all
the
prominent
members
of
this
association
were
estimable
men
both
in
public
and
in
private
life
these
further
extracts
from
their
correspondence
may
be
left
to
speak
for
themselves

the
illuminati

weishaupt
writes
to

follows
oh
in
politics
and

you
are

behind

gentlemen
judge
further
if
such
a

as

finds

how
wretched

what
a

of
immoral

liars
debtors
boasters
and
vain
fools
they
have
amongst
them
if
he
saw
all
that
what
do
you
suppose
the
man
would
think
would
he
not
be
ashamed
to
find
himself
in
such
an
association
in
which
the
leaders
arouse
the
greatest
expectations
and
carry
out
the
best
plan
in
such
a
miserable
manner
and
all
this
out
of
caprice

no

together
with

it
will
doubtless
be
suggested
at
this
point
that
all
these
letters
merely
portray
the
lofty
idealist
sorrowing
over
the
frailties
of
his
erring
disciples
but
let
us
hear
what
weishaupt
has
to
say
about
himself
in
a
letter
to
marius
hertel
he
writes
and
now
in
the
strictest
confidence
a
matter
near
my
heart
which
robs
me
of
all
rest
makes
me
incapable
of
anything
and
drives
me
to
despair
i
stand
in
danger
of
losing
my
honour
and
my
reputation
which
gave
me
so
much
power
over
our
people
think
my
is
expecting
a
child
i
have
for
this
purpose
sent
to
euriphon
in
athens
to
solicit
the
marriage
licence
and
promotorial
from
rome
you
see
how
much
depends
on
this
and
that
no
time
must
be
lost
every
minute
is
precious
but
if
the
dispensation
does
not
arrive
what
shall
i
do
how
shall
i
make
amends
to
the
person
since
i
alone
am
to
blame
we
have
already
tried
several
ways
to
get
rid
of
the
child
she
herself
was
resolved
for
anything
but
euriphon
is
too
timid
and
yet
i
see
no
other
expedient
if
i
could
ensure
the
silence
of
celsus
he
could
help
me
and
indeed
he
already
promised
me
this
three
years
ago
if
you
can
help
me
out
of
this
dilemma
you
will
give
me
back
life
honour
peace
and
power
to
work
i
do
not
know
what
devil
led
me
astray
i
who
always
in
these
circumstances
took
extreme
precautions
a
little
later
weishaupt
writes
again
all
fatalities
happen
to
me
at
the
same
time
now
there
is
my
mother
dead
corpse
wedding
christening
all
in
a
short
time
one
on
the
top
of
the
other
what
a
wonderful
so
much
for
what
gould
calls
the
rare
qualities
of
heart
let
us
now
listen
to
the
testimony
of
weishaupt
principal
coadjutor
philo
the
baron
von
knigge
to
whom
the
historian
of
freemasonry
refers
as
a
lovable
enthusiast
in
all
subversive
associations
whether
open
or
secret
directed
by
men
who
aim
at
power
a
moment
is
certain
to
arrive
when
the
ambitions
of
the
leaders
come
into
conflict
this
is
the
history
of
every
revolutionary
organization
during
the
last
years
it
was
when
the
inevitable
climax
had
been
reached
between
weishaupt
and
knigge
that
philo
wrote
to
the
most
loving
cato
in
the
following
terms
it
is
not
mahomed
and
who
are
so
much
to
blame
for
my
break
with
spartacus
as
the
jesuitical
conduct
of
this
man
which
has
so
often
turned
us
against
each
other
in
order
to
rule
despotically
over
men
who
if
they
have
not
perhaps
such
a
rich
imagination
as
himself
also
do
not
possess
so
much
cuteness
and
cunning
etc
in
a
further
letter
philo
goes
on
to
enumerate
the
services
he
has
rendered
to
weishaupt
in
the
past
at
the
bidding
of
spartacus
i
have
written
against
and
rosicrucians
persecuted
people
who
never
did
me
any
harm
thrown
the
into
confusion
drawn
the
best
amongst
them
to
us
told
them
of
the
worthiness
of
of
its
power
its
age
the
excellence
of
its
chiefs
the
blamelessness
of
its
higher
leaders
the
importance
of
its
knowledge
and
given
great
ideas
of
the
uprightness
of
its
views
those
amongst
us
who
are
now
working
so
actively
for
us
but
cling
much
to
religiousness
an
religiosität
and
who
feared
our
intention
was
to
spread
deism
i
have
sought
to
persuade
that
the
higher
superiors
had
nothing
less
than
this
intention
gradually
however
i
shall
work
it
as
i
please
und
nach
wirke
ich
dock
was
ich
if
i
now
were
to
give
a
hint
to
the
jesuits
and
rosicrucians
as
to
who
is
persecuting
them
if
i
were
to
make
known
to
a
few
people
the
jesuitical
character
of
the
man
who
leads
perhaps
all
of
us
by
the
nose
uses
us
for
his
ambitious
schemes
sacrifices
us
as
often
as
his
obstinacy
requires
if
i
were
to
make
known
to
them
what
they
have
to
fear
from
such
a
man
from
such
a
machine
behind
which
perhaps
jesuits
may
be
concealed
or
might
conceal
themselves
if
i
were
to
assure
those
who
seek
for
secrets
that
they
have
nothing
to
expect
if
i
were
to
confide
to
those
who
hold
religion
dear
the
principles
of
the
general
if
i
were
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
lodges
to
an
association
behind
which
the
illuminati
are
concealed
if
i
were
again
to
associate
myself
with
princes
and
freemasons
but
i
shrink
from
the
thought
vengeance
will
not
carry
me
so
far
we
have
now
seen
enough
of
the
aims
and
methods
of
the
illuminati
and
the
true
characters
of
their
leaders
from
their
own
admissions
to
make
the
case
complete
it
would
be
necessary
also
to
give
a
résumé
of
the
confessions
made
by
the
the
four
professors
cosandey
grünberger
utzschneider
and
renner
as
also
of
the
further
published
works
of
the
illuminati
but
space
and
time
forbid
what
is
needed
is
a
complete
book
on
the
subject
consisting
of
translations
of
the
most
important
passages
in
all
the
contemporary
german
publications
from
the
extracts
given
above
can
it
however
be
seriously
contended
that
barruel
or
robison
exaggerated
the
guilt
of
the
order
do
my
literal
translations
differ
materially
in
sense
from
the
translations
and
occasional
paraphrases
given
by
the
couple
even
those
contemporaries
mounier
and
the
member
of
the
illuminati
who
set
out
to
refute
barruel
and
lombard
de
langres
merely
provide
further
confirmation
of
their
views
thus
mounier
is
obliged
to
confess
that
the
real
design
of
illuminism
was
to
undermine
all
civil
order
and
ancien
illuminé
asserts
in
language
no
less
forcible
than
barruel
own
that
weishaupt
made
a
code
of
machiavellism
that
his
method
was
a
profound
perversity
flattering
everything
that
was
base
and
rancorous
in
human
nature
in
order
to
arrive
at
his
ends
that
he
was
not
inspired
by
a
wise
spirit
of
reform
but
by
a
fanatical
enmity
inimical
to
all
authority
on
earth
the
only
essential
points
on
which
the
opposing
parties
differ
is
that
whilst
mounier
and
ancien
illuminé
deny
the
influence
of
the
illuminati
on
the
french
revolution
and
maintain
that
they
ceased
to
exist
in
barruel
and
lombard
de
langres
present
them
as
the
inspirers
of
the
jacobins
and
declare
them
to
be
still
active
after
the
revolution
had
ended
that
on
this
point
at
any
rate
the
latter
were
right
we
shall
see
in
a
further
chapter
the
great
question
that
presents
itself
after
studying
the
writings
of
the
illuminati
is
what
was
the
motive
power
behind
the
order
if
we
admit
the
possibility
that
frederick
the
great
and
the
stricte
observance
working
through
an
inner
circle
of
freemasons
at
the
lodge
theodore
may
have
provided
the
first
impetus
and
that
kölmer
initiated
weishaupt
into
oriental
methods
of
organization
the
source
of
inspiration
from
which
weishaupt
subsequently
drew
his
anarchic
philosophy
still
remains
obscure
it
has
frequently
been
suggested
that
his
real
inspirers
were
jews
and
the
jewish
writer
bernard
lazare
definitely
states
that
there
were
jews
cabalistic
jews
around
weishaupt
a
writer
in
vieille
went
so
far
as
to
designate
these
jews
as
moses
mendelssohn
wessely
and
the
bankers
itzig
friedlander
and
meyer
but
no
documentary
evidence
has
ever
been
produced
in
support
of
these
statements
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
examine
them
in
the
light
of
probability
now
as
i
have
already
shown
the
theosophical
ideas
of
the
cabala
play
no
part
in
the
system
of
illuminism
the
only
trace
of
cabalism
to
be
found
amongst
the
papers
of
the
order
is
a
list
of
recipes
for
procuring
abortion
for
making
aphrodisiacs
aqua
toffana
pestilential
vapours
headed
cabala
major
it
is
possible
then
that
the
illuminati
may
have
learnt
something
of
venefic
magic
and
the
use
of
certain
natural
substances
from
jewish
cabalists
at
the
same
time
jews
appear
to
have
been
only
in
rare
cases
admitted
to
the
order
everything
indeed
tends
to
prove
that
weishaupt
and
his
first
coadjutors
zwack
and
massenhausen
were
pure
germans
nevertheless
there
is
between
the
ideas
of
weishaupt
and
of
lessing
falk
a
distinct
resemblance
both
in
the
writings
of
the
illuminati
and
in
lessing
we
find
the
same
vein
of
irony
with
regard
to
freemasonry
the
same
design
that
it
should
be
replaced
by
a
more
effectual
system
the
same
denunciations
of
the
existing
social
order
and
of
bourgeois
society
the
same
theory
that
men
should
be
the
same
plan
of
obliterating
all
distinctions
between
nations
even
the
same
simile
of
the
as
applied
to
human
life
which
as
i
have
shown
elsewhere
was
later
on
adopted
by
the
anarchist
proudhon
it
may
however
legitimately
be
urged
that
these
ideas
were
those
of
the
inner
masonic
circle
to
which
both
lessing
and
weishaupt
belonged
and
that
though
placed
in
the
mouth
of
falk
they
were
in
no
sense
judaic
but
lessing
was
also
the
friend
and
admirer
of
moses
mendelssohn
who
has
been
suggested
as
one
of
weishaupt
inspirers
now
at
first
sight
nothing
seems
more
improbable
than
that
an
orthodox
jew
such
as
mendelssohn
should
have
accorded
any
sympathy
to
the
anarchic
scheme
of
weishaupt
nevertheless
certain
of
weishaupt
doctrines
are
not
incompatible
with
the
principles
of
orthodox
judaism
thus
for
example
weishaupt
theory
so
strangely
at
variance
with
his
denunciations
of
the
family
system
that
as
a
result
of
illuminism
the
head
of
every
family
will
be
what
abraham
was
the
patriarch
the
priest
and
the
unfettered
lord
of
his
family
and
reason
will
be
the
only
code
of
man
is
essentially
a
jewish
conception
it
will
be
objected
that
the
patriarchal
system
as
conceived
by
orthodox
jews
could
by
no
means
include
the
religion
of
reason
as
advocated
by
weishaupt
it
must
not
however
be
forgotten
that
to
the
jewish
mind
the
human
race
presents
a
dual
aspect
being
divided
into
two
distinct
categories
the
privileged
race
to
whom
the
promises
of
god
were
made
and
the
great
mass
of
humanity
which
remains
outside
the
pale
whilst
strict
adherence
to
the
commands
of
the
talmud
and
the
laws
of
moses
is
expected
of
the
former
the
most
indefinite
of
religious
creeds
suffices
for
the
nations
excluded
from
the
privileges
that
jewish
birth
confers
it
was
thus
that
moses
mendelssohn
wrote
to
the
pastor
lavater
who
had
sought
to
win
him
over
to
christianity
pursuant
to
the
principles
of
my
religion
i
am
not
to
seek
to
convert
anyone
who
is
not
born
according
to
our
laws
this
proneness
to
conversion
the
origin
of
which
some
would
fain
tack
on
to
the
jewish
religion
is
nevertheless
diametrically
opposed
to
it
our
rabbis
unanimously
teach
that
the
written
and
oral
laws
which
form
conjointly
our
revealed
religion
are
obligatory
on
our
nation
only
moses
commanded
us
a
law
even
the
inheritance
of
the
congregation
of
jacob
we
believe
that
all
other
nations
of
the
earth
have
been
directed
by
god
to
adhere
to
the
laws
of
nature
and
to
the
religion
of
the
patriarchs
those
who
regulate
their
lives
according
to
the
precepts
of
this
of
nature
and
of
are
called
virtuous
men
of
other
nations
and
are
the
children
of
eternal
salvation
our
rabbis
are
so
remote
from
proselytomania
that
they
enjoin
us
to
dissuade
by
forcible
remonstrances
everyone
who
comes
forward
to
be
converted
the
talmud
says
proselytes
are
annoying
to
israel
like
a
scab
but
was
not
this
religion
of
nature
and
of
reason
the
precise
conception
of
weishaupt
whether
then
weishaupt
was
directly
inspired
by
mendelssohn
or
any
other
jew
must
remain
for
the
present
an
open
question
but
the
jewish
connexions
of
certain
other
illuminati
can
not
be
disputed
the
most
important
of
these
was
mirabeau
who
arrived
in
berlin
just
after
the
death
of
mendelssohn
and
was
welcomed
by
his
disciples
in
the
jewish
salon
of
henrietta
herz
it
was
these
jews
ardent
supporters
of
the
french
revolution
at
its
outset
who
prevailed
on
mirabeau
to
write
his
great
apology
for
their
race
under
the
form
of
a
panegyric
of
mendelssohn
to
sum
up
i
do
not
so
far
see
in
illuminism
a
jewish
conspiracy
to
destroy
christianity
but
rather
a
movement
finding
its
principal
dynamic
force
in
the
ancient
spirit
of
revolt
against
the
existing
social
and
moral
order
aided
and
abetted
perhaps
by
jews
who
saw
in
it
a
system
that
might
be
turned
to
their
own
advantage
meanwhile
illuminism
made
use
of
every
other
movement
that
could
serve
its
purpose
as
the
contemporary
de
luchet
has
expressed
it
the
system
of
the
illuminés
is
not
to
embrace
the
dogmas
of
a
sect
but
to
turn
all
errors
to
its
advantage
to
concentrate
in
itself
everything
that
men
have
invented
in
the
way
of
duplicity
and
imposture
more
than
this
illuminism
was
not
only
the
assemblage
of
all
errors
of
all
ruses
of
all
subtleties
of
a
theoretic
kind
it
was
also
an
assemblage
of
all
practical
methods
for
rousing
men
to
action
for
in
the
words
of
von
hammer
on
the
assassins
that
can
not
be
too
often
repeated
opinions
are
powerless
so
long
as
they
only
confuse
the
brain
without
arming
the
hand
scepticism
and
as
long
as
they
occupied
only
the
minds
of
the
indolent
and
philosophical
have
caused
the
ruin
of
no
throne
it
is
nothing
to
the
ambitious
man
what
people
believe
but
it
is
everything
to
know
how
he
may
turn
them
for
the
execution
of
his
projects
this
was
what
weishaupt
so
admirably
understood
he
knew
how
to
take
from
every
association
past
and
present
the
portions
he
required
and
to
weld
them
all
into
a
working
system
of
terrible
efficiency
the
disintegrating
doctrines
of
the
gnostics
and
manicheans
of
the
modern
philosophers
and
encyclopædists
the
methods
of
the
ismailis
and
the
assassins
the
discipline
of
the
jesuits
and
templars
the
organization
and
secrecy
of
the
freemasons
the
philosophy
of
machiavelli
the
mystery
of
the
rosicrucians
he
knew
moreover
how
to
enlist
the
right
elements
in
all
existing
associations
as
well
as
isolated
individuals
and
turn
them
to
his
purpose
so
in
the
army
of
the
illuminati
we
find
men
of
every
shade
of
thought
from
the
poet
goethe
to
the
meanest
intriguer
lofty
idealists
social
reformers
visionaries
and
at
the
same
time
the
ambitious
the
rancorous
and
the
disgruntled
men
swayed
by
lust
or
embittered
by
grievances
all
these
differing
in
their
aims
yet
by
weishaupt
admirable
system
of
watertight
compartments
precluded
from
a
knowledge
of
these
differences
and
all
marching
unconsciously
or
not
towards
the
same
goal
although
this
was
not
the
invention
of
weishaupt
but
had
been
foreshadowed
many
centuries
earlier
in
the
east
it
was
weishaupt
so
far
as
we
know
who
reduced
it
to
a
working
system
for
the
west
a
system
which
has
been
adhered
to
by
succeeding
groups
of
up
to
the
present
day
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
have
quoted
at
length
the
writings
of
the
illuminati
all
the
ruses
all
the
hypocrisy
all
the
subtle
methods
of
camouflage
which
characterized
the
order
will
be
found
again
in
the
insidious
propaganda
both
of
the
modern
secret
societies
and
the
open
revolutionary
organizations
whose
object
is
to
subvert
all
order
all
morality
and
all
religion
i
maintain
therefore
with
greater
conviction
than
ever
the
importance
of
illuminism
in
the
history
of
but
for
this
of
methods
the
philosophers
and
encyclopædists
might
have
gone
on
for
ever
inveighing
against
thrones
and
altars
the
martinistes
evoking
spirits
the
magicians
weaving
spells
the
freemasons
declaiming
on
universal
brotherhood
none
of
these
would
have
armed
the
hand
and
driven
the
infuriated
mobs
into
the
streets
of
paris
it
was
not
until
the
emissaries
of
weishaupt
formed
an
alliance
with
the
orléaniste
leaders
that
vague
subversive
theory
became
active
revolution
the
climax
the
first
masonic
body
with
which
the
illuminati
formed
an
alliance
was
the
stricte
observance
to
which
the
illuminati
knigge
and
bode
both
belonged
cagliostro
had
also
been
initiated
into
the
stricte
observance
near
frankfurt
and
was
now
employed
as
agent
of
the
combined
order
according
to
his
own
confession
his
mission
was
to
work
so
as
to
turn
freemasonry
in
the
direction
of
weishaupt
projects
and
the
funds
he
drew
upon
were
those
of
the
illuminati
cagliostro
also
formed
a
link
with
the
martinistes
whose
doctrines
though
derided
by
weishaupt
were
useful
to
his
plan
in
attracting
by
their
mystical
character
those
who
would
have
been
repelled
by
the
cynicism
of
the
illuminati
according
to
barruel
it
was
the
martinistes
who
following
in
the
footsteps
of
the
rosicrucians
had
suggested
to
weishaupt
the
device
of
presenting
christ
as
an
illuminatus
which
had
led
to
such
triumphant
results
amongst
the
protestant
clergy
but
if
weishaupt
made
use
of
the
various
masonic
associations
they
on
their
account
found
in
him
a
valuable
ally
the
fact
is
that
by
this
time
both
french
and
german
freemasons
were
very
much
at
sea
with
regard
to
the
whole
subject
of
masonry
and
needed
someone
to
give
a
point
to
their
deliberations
thus
at
the
congress
of
wilhelmsbad
convened
on
july
and
attended
by
representatives
of
masonic
bodies
from
all
over
the
world
the
first
question
propounded
by
the
grand
master
of
the
templars
the
stricte
observance
was
is
the
real
object
of
the
order
and
its
true
so
says
mirabeau
in
relating
this
incident
this
same
grand
master
and
all
his
assistants
had
worked
for
more
than
twenty
years
with
incredible
ardour
at
a
thing
of
which
they
knew
neither
the
real
object
nor
the
origin
two
years
later
the
freemasons
of
france
do
not
appear
to
have
been
any
less
in
the
dark
on
this
matter
for
we
find
them
writing
to
general
rainsford
one
of
the
english
masons
who
had
been
present
at
the
congress
of
wilhelmsbad
as
follows
since
you
say
that
masonry
has
never
experienced
any
variation
in
its
aim
do
you
then
know
with
certainty
what
this
unique
object
is
is
it
useful
for
the
happiness
of
mankind
tell
us
if
it
is
of
an
historical
political
hermetical
or
scientific
nature
moral
social
or
religious
are
the
traditions
oral
or
written
but
weishaupt
had
a
very
definite
object
in
view
which
was
to
gain
control
of
all
freemasonry
and
though
he
himself
was
not
present
at
the
congress
his
coadjutor
knigge
who
had
been
travelling
about
germany
proclaiming
himself
the
reformer
of
freemasonry
presented
himself
at
wilhelmsbad
armed
with
full
authority
from
weishaupt
and
succeeded
in
enrolling
a
number
of
magistrates
savants
ecclesiastics
and
ministers
of
state
as
illuminati
and
in
allying
himself
with
the
deputies
of
and
willermoz
vanquished
by
this
powerful
rival
the
stricte
observance
ceased
temporarily
to
exist
and
illuminism
was
left
in
possession
of
the
field
on
february
a
further
congress
took
place
in
paris
convened
this
time
by
the
philalèthes
at
which
the
illuminati
bode
alias
amelius
and
the
baron
de
busche
alias
bayard
were
present
also
it
has
been
stated
the
magician
cagliostro
the
magnetiser
mesmer
the
cabalist
duchanteau
and
of
course
the
leaders
of
the
philalèthes
savalette
de
langes
who
was
elected
president
the
marquis
de
chefdebien
and
a
number
of
german
members
of
the
same
order
this
congress
led
to
no
very
practical
results
and
a
further
and
more
secret
one
was
convened
in
the
following
year
at
frankfurt
where
a
grand
lodge
had
been
established
in
it
was
here
that
the
deaths
of
louis
xvi
and
gustavus
iii
of
sweden
are
said
to
have
been
decreed
but
already
in
this
same
year
of
the
first
act
of
the
revolutionary
drama
had
been
played
out
the
famous
affair
of
the
necklace
can
never
be
understood
in
the
pages
of
official
history
only
an
examination
of
the
mechanism
provided
by
the
secret
societies
can
explain
that
extraordinary
episode
which
in
the
opinion
of
napoleon
contributed
more
than
any
other
cause
to
the
explosion
of
in
its
double
attack
on
church
and
monarchy
the
affair
of
the
necklace
fulfilled
the
purpose
of
both
frederick
the
great
and
of
the
illuminati
cagliostro
we
know
received
both
money
and
instructions
from
the
order
for
carrying
out
the
plot
and
after
it
had
ended
in
his
own
and
the
cardinal
de
exoneration
and
exile
we
find
him
embarking
on
fresh
work
in
london
where
he
arrived
in
november
of
the
same
year
announcing
himself
as
the
count
sutkowski
member
of
a
society
at
avignon
he
visited
the
swedenborgians
at
their
theosophical
society
meeting
in
rooms
in
the
middle
temple
and
displayed
minute
acquaintance
with
their
doctrines
whilst
claiming
a
superior
knowledge
according
to
a
generally
received
opinion
cagliostro
was
the
author
of
a
mysterious
proclamation
which
appeared
at
this
moment
in
the
in
the
cypher
of
the
but
in
the
year
before
these
events
an
extraordinary
thing
had
happened
an
evangelist
preacher
and
illuminatus
named
lanze
had
been
sent
in
july
as
an
emissary
of
the
illuminati
to
silesia
but
on
his
journey
he
was
struck
down
by
lightning
the
instructions
of
the
order
were
found
on
him
and
as
a
result
its
intrigues
were
conclusively
revealed
to
the
government
of
bavaria
a
searching
enquiry
followed
the
houses
of
zwack
and
bassus
were
raided
and
it
was
then
that
the
documents
and
other
incriminating
evidence
referred
to
in
the
preceding
chapter
of
this
book
were
seized
and
made
public
under
the
name
of
original
writings
of
the
order
of
the
but
before
this
the
evidence
of
four
professors
of
munich
was
published
in
two
separate
volumes
the
diabolical
nature
of
illuminism
now
remained
no
longer
a
matter
of
doubt
and
the
order
was
officially
suppressed
the
opponents
of
barruel
and
robison
therefore
declare
that
illuminism
came
finally
to
an
end
we
shall
see
later
by
documentary
evidence
that
it
never
ceased
to
exist
and
that
years
later
not
only
the
illuminati
but
weishaupt
himself
were
still
as
active
as
ever
behind
the
scenes
in
freemasonry
but
for
the
present
we
must
follow
its
course
from
the
moment
of
its
apparent
extinction
in
this
course
can
be
traced
not
only
through
the
german
union
which
is
believed
to
have
been
a
reorganization
of
the
original
illuminati
but
through
the
secret
societies
of
france
illuminism
in
reality
is
less
an
order
than
a
principle
and
a
principle
which
can
work
better
under
cover
of
something
else
weishaupt
himself
had
laid
down
the
precept
that
the
work
of
illuminism
could
best
be
conducted
under
other
names
and
other
occupations
and
henceforth
we
shall
always
find
it
carried
on
by
this
skilful
system
of
camouflage
the
first
cover
adopted
was
the
lodge
of
the
amis
réunis
in
paris
with
which
as
we
have
already
seen
the
illuminati
had
established
relations
but
now
in
a
definite
alliance
was
effected
by
the
aforementioned
illuminati
bode
and
busche
who
in
response
to
an
invitation
from
the
secret
committee
of
the
lodge
arrived
in
paris
in
february
of
this
year
here
they
found
the
old
illuminatus
mirabeau
who
with
talleyrand
had
been
largely
instrumental
in
summoning
these
german
brothers
and
according
to
gustave
bord
two
important
members
of
the
stricte
observance
the
marquis
de
chefdebien
a
capite
and
an
austrian
the
comte
leopold
de
ab
aquila
who
also
belonged
to
weishaupt
order
of
illuminati
in
which
he
bore
the
pseudonym
of
numenius
it
is
important
here
to
recognize
the
peculiar
part
played
by
the
lodge
of
the
whilst
the
des
neuf
was
largely
composed
of
revolutionaries
such
as
brissot
danton
camille
desmoulins
and
champfort
and
the
de
la
of
aristocratic
revolutionaries
lafayette
as
well
as
the
orléanistes
the
marquis
de
sillery
the
duc
the
marquis
de
custine
and
the
lameths
loge
du
contrat
was
mainly
composed
of
honest
visionaries
who
entertained
no
revolutionary
projects
but
according
to
barruel
were
strongly
royalist
the
rôle
of
the
amis
réunis
was
to
collect
together
the
subversives
from
all
other
lodges
philalèthes
members
of
the
des
neuf
and
of
the
de
la
and
of
the
most
secret
committees
of
the
grand
orient
as
well
as
deputies
from
the
in
the
provinces
here
then
at
the
lodge
in
the
rue
de
la
sordière
under
the
direction
of
savalette
de
langes
were
to
be
found
the
disciples
of
weishaupt
of
swedenborg
and
of
as
well
as
the
practical
makers
of
revolution
the
agitators
and
demagogues
of
the
influence
of
german
illuminism
on
all
these
heterogeneous
elements
was
enormous
from
this
moment
says
a
further
bavarian
report
of
the
matter
a
complete
change
took
place
in
the
order
of
the
amis
réunis
hitherto
only
vaguely
subversive
the
chevaliers
bienfaisants
became
the
chevaliers
malfaisants
the
amis
réunis
became
the
ennemis
réunis
the
arrival
of
the
two
germans
bode
and
busche
gave
the
finishing
touch
to
the
conspiracy
the
avowed
object
of
their
journey
was
to
obtain
information
about
magnetism
which
was
just
then
making
a
great
stir
but
in
reality
taken
up
with
the
gigantic
plan
of
their
order
their
real
aim
was
to
make
proselytes
it
will
be
seen
that
the
following
passage
exactly
confirms
the
account
given
by
barruel
as
the
lodge
of
the
collected
together
everything
that
could
be
found
out
from
all
other
masonic
systems
in
the
world
so
the
way
was
soon
paved
there
for
illuminism
it
was
also
not
long
before
this
lodge
together
with
all
those
that
depended
on
it
was
impregnated
with
illuminism
the
former
system
of
all
these
was
as
if
wiped
out
so
that
from
this
time
onwards
the
framework
of
the
philalèthes
quite
disappeared
and
in
the
place
of
the
former
extravagance
came
in
the
it
was
therefore
not
martinism
cabalism
or
freemasonry
that
in
themselves
provided
the
real
revolutionary
force
many
freemasons
as
barruel
himself
declares
remained
loyal
to
the
throne
and
altar
and
as
soon
as
the
monarchy
was
seen
to
be
in
danger
the
royalist
brothers
of
the
boldly
summoned
the
lodges
to
coalesce
in
defence
of
king
and
constitution
even
some
of
the
upper
masons
who
in
the
degree
of
knight
kadosch
had
sworn
hatred
to
the
pope
and
bourbon
monarchy
rallied
likewise
to
the
royal
cause
the
french
spirit
triumphed
over
the
masonic
spirit
in
the
greater
number
of
the
brothers
opinions
as
well
as
hearts
were
still
for
the
king
it
needed
the
devastating
doctrines
of
weishaupt
to
undermine
this
spirit
and
to
turn
the
degrees
of
vengeance
from
vain
ceremonial
into
terrible
fact
if
then
it
is
said
that
the
revolution
was
prepared
in
the
lodges
of
freemasons
and
many
french
masons
have
boasted
of
the
fact
let
it
always
be
added
that
it
was
that
made
the
revolution
and
that
the
masons
who
acclaim
it
are
illuminized
masons
inheritors
of
the
same
tradition
introduced
into
the
lodges
of
france
in
by
the
disciples
of
weishaupt
patriarch
of
the
jacobins
many
of
the
freemasons
of
france
in
were
thus
not
conscious
allies
of
the
illuminati
according
to
cadet
de
gassicourt
there
were
in
all
the
lodges
only
real
initiates
the
rest
were
largely
dupes
who
knew
little
or
nothing
of
the
source
whence
the
fresh
influence
among
them
derived
the
amazing
feature
of
the
whole
situation
is
that
the
most
enthusiastic
supporters
of
the
movement
were
men
belonging
to
the
upper
classes
and
even
to
the
royal
families
of
europe
a
contemporary
relates
that
no
less
than
thirty
princes
reigning
and
had
taken
under
their
protection
a
confederation
from
which
they
stood
to
lose
everything
and
had
become
so
imbued
by
its
principles
that
they
were
inaccessible
to
reason
intoxicated
by
the
flattery
lavished
on
them
by
the
priests
of
illuminism
they
adopted
a
religion
of
which
they
understood
nothing
weishaupt
of
course
had
taken
care
that
none
of
these
royal
dupes
should
be
initiated
into
the
real
aims
of
the
order
and
at
first
adhered
to
the
original
plan
of
excluding
them
altogether
but
the
value
of
their
soon
became
apparent
and
by
a
supreme
irony
it
was
with
a
grand
duke
that
he
himself
took
refuge
but
if
the
great
majority
of
princes
and
nobles
were
stricken
with
blindness
at
this
crisis
a
few
spirits
recognized
the
danger
and
warned
the
world
of
the
impending
disaster
in
cardinal
caprara
apostolic
nuncio
at
vienna
addressed
a
confidential
memoir
to
the
pope
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
the
activities
carried
on
in
germany
by
the
different
sects
of
illuminés
of
perfectibilists
of
freemasons
were
increasing
the
danger
is
approaching
for
from
all
these
senseless
dreams
of
illuminism
of
swedenborgianism
or
of
freemasonry
a
frightful
reality
will
emerge
visionaries
have
their
time
the
revolution
they
forebode
will
have
its
time
also
a
more
amazing
prophecy
however
was
the
sur
la
secte
des
by
the
marquis
de
luchet
a
liberal
noble
who
played
some
part
in
the
revolutionary
movement
yet
who
nevertheless
realized
the
dangers
of
illuminism
thus
as
early
as
before
the
revolution
had
really
developed
de
luchet
uttered
these
words
of
warning
deluded
people
learn
that
there
exists
a
conspiracy
in
favour
of
despotism
against
liberty
of
incapacity
against
talent
of
vice
against
virtue
of
ignorance
against
enlightenment
this
society
aims
at
governing
the
world
its
object
is
universal
domination
this
plan
may
seem
extraordinary
incredible
yes
but
not
chimerical
no
such
calamity
has
ever
yet
afflicted
the
world
de
luchet
then
goes
on
to
foretell
precisely
the
events
that
were
to
take
place
three
and
four
years
later
he
describes
the
position
of
a
king
who
has
to
recognize
masters
above
himself
and
to
authorize
their
abominable
régime
to
become
the
plaything
of
an
ambitious
and
fanatical
horde
which
has
taken
possession
of
his
will
see
him
condemned
to
serve
the
passions
of
all
that
surround
him
to
raise
degraded
men
to
power
to
prostitute
his
judgement
by
choices
that
dishonour
his
prudence
all
this
was
exactly
fulfilled
during
the
reign
of
the
girondin
ministry
of
the
campaign
of
destruction
carried
out
in
the
summer
of
is
thus
foretold
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
country
where
the
illuminés
reign
will
cease
to
exist
but
it
will
fall
into
such
a
degree
of
humiliation
that
it
will
no
longer
count
in
politics
that
the
population
will
diminish
that
the
inhabitants
who
resist
the
inclination
to
pass
into
a
foreign
land
will
no
longer
enjoy
the
happiness
of
consideration
nor
the
charms
of
society
nor
the
gifts
of
commerce
and
de
luchet
ends
with
this
despairing
appeal
to
the
powers
of
europe
masters
of
the
world
cast
your
eyes
on
a
desolated
multitude
listen
to
their
cries
their
tears
their
hopes
a
mother
asks
you
to
restore
her
son
a
wife
her
husband
your
cities
for
the
fine
arts
that
have
fled
from
them
the
country
for
citizens
the
fields
for
cultivators
religion
for
forms
of
worship
and
nature
for
beings
of
which
she
is
worthy
five
years
after
these
words
were
written
the
countryside
of
france
was
desolate
art
and
commerce
were
destroyed
and
women
following
the
tumbril
that
carried
to
the
guillotine
cried
out
give
me
back
my
brother
my
son
my
husband
so
was
this
amazing
prophecy
fulfilled
yet
not
one
word
has
history
to
say
on
the
subject
the
warning
of
de
luchet
has
fallen
on
deaf
ears
amongst
posterity
as
amongst
the
men
of
his
own
day
de
luchet
himself
recognizes
the
obstacle
to
his
obtaining
a
hearing
there
are
too
many
passions
interested
in
supporting
the
system
of
the
illuminés
too
many
deluded
rulers
imagining
themselves
enlightened
ready
to
precipitate
their
people
into
the
abyss
whilst
the
heads
of
the
order
will
never
relinquish
the
authority
they
have
acquired
nor
the
treasure
at
their
disposal
in
vain
de
luchet
appeals
to
the
freemasons
to
save
their
order
from
the
invading
sect
would
it
not
be
possible
he
asks
to
direct
the
freemasons
themselves
against
the
illuminés
by
showing
them
that
whilst
they
are
working
to
maintain
harmony
in
society
those
others
are
everywhere
sowing
seeds
of
discord
and
preparing
the
ultimate
destruction
of
their
order
so
far
it
is
not
too
late
if
only
men
will
believe
in
the
danger
it
may
be
averted
from
the
moment
they
are
convinced
the
necessary
blow
is
dealt
to
the
sect
otherwise
de
luchet
prophesies
a
series
of
calamities
of
which
the
end
is
lost
in
the
darkness
of
time
a
subterranean
fire
smouldering
eternally
and
breaking
forth
periodically
in
violent
and
devastating
explosions
what
words
could
better
describe
the
history
of
the
last
years
the
sur
la
sects
des
is
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
documents
of
history
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
mysterious
why
it
should
have
been
written
by
the
marquis
de
luchet
who
is
said
to
have
collaborated
with
mirabeau
in
the
de
published
in
the
following
year
why
it
should
have
been
appended
to
secrète
de
la
cour
de
and
accordingly
attributed
to
mirabeau
himself
why
barruel
should
have
denounced
it
as
dust
thrown
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
although
it
entirely
corroborated
his
own
point
of
view
are
questions
to
which
i
can
find
no
reply
that
is
was
written
seriously
and
in
all
good
faith
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
whilst
the
fact
that
it
appeared
before
instead
of
after
the
events
described
renders
it
even
more
valuable
evidence
of
the
reality
of
the
conspiracy
than
barruel
own
admirable
work
what
barruel
saw
de
luchet
foresaw
with
equal
clearness
as
to
the
rôle
of
mirabeau
at
this
crisis
we
can
only
hazard
an
explanation
on
the
score
of
his
habitual
inconsistency
at
one
moment
he
was
seeking
interviews
with
the
king
ministers
in
order
to
warn
them
of
the
coming
danger
at
the
next
he
was
energetically
stirring
up
insurrection
it
is
therefore
not
impossible
that
he
may
have
encouraged
de
luchet
exposure
of
the
conspiracy
although
meanwhile
he
himself
had
entered
into
the
scheme
of
destruction
indeed
according
to
a
pamphlet
published
in
entitled
de
la
the
whole
plan
of
revolution
was
found
amongst
his
papers
the
editor
of
this
explains
that
the
document
here
made
public
called
ou
projet
de
révolution
de
monsieur
de
was
seized
at
the
house
of
madame
lejai
the
wife
of
mirabeau
publisher
on
october
beginning
with
a
diatribe
against
the
french
monarchy
the
document
goes
on
to
say
that
in
order
to
triumph
over
this
monster
these
are
my
ideas
we
must
overthrow
all
order
suppress
all
laws
annul
all
power
and
leave
the
people
in
anarchy
the
laws
we
establish
will
not
perhaps
be
in
force
at
once
but
at
any
rate
having
given
back
the
power
to
the
people
they
will
resist
for
the
sake
of
their
liberty
which
they
will
believe
they
are
preserving
we
must
caress
their
vanity
flatter
their
hopes
promise
them
happiness
after
our
work
has
been
in
operation
we
must
elude
their
caprices
and
their
systems
at
will
for
the
people
as
legislators
are
very
dangerous
they
only
establish
laws
which
coincide
with
their
passions
their
want
of
knowledge
would
besides
only
give
birth
to
abuses
but
as
the
people
are
a
lever
which
legislators
can
move
at
their
will
we
must
necessarily
use
them
as
a
support
and
render
hateful
to
them
everything
we
wish
to
destroy
and
sow
illusions
in
their
path
we
must
also
buy
all
the
mercenary
pens
which
propagate
our
methods
and
which
will
instruct
the
people
concerning
their
enemies
whom
we
attack
the
clergy
being
the
most
powerful
through
public
opinion
can
only
be
destroyed
by
ridiculing
religion
rendering
its
ministers
odious
and
only
representing
them
as
hypocritical
monsters
for
mahomet
in
order
to
establish
his
religion
first
defamed
the
paganism
which
the
arabs
the
sarmathes
and
the
scythians
professed
libels
must
at
every
moment
show
fresh
traces
of
hatred
against
the
clergy
to
exaggerate
their
riches
to
make
the
sins
of
an
individual
appear
to
be
common
to
all
to
attribute
to
them
all
vices
calumny
murder
irreligion
sacrilege
all
is
permitted
in
times
of
revolution
we
must
degrade
the
and
attribute
it
to
an
odious
origin
establish
a
germ
of
equality
which
can
never
exist
but
which
will
flatter
the
people
we
must
immolate
the
most
obstinate
burn
and
destroy
their
property
in
order
to
intimidate
the
rest
so
that
if
we
can
not
entirely
destroy
this
prejudice
we
can
weaken
it
and
the
people
will
avenge
their
vanity
and
their
jealousy
by
all
the
excesses
which
will
bring
them
to
submission
after
describing
how
the
soldiers
are
to
be
seduced
from
their
allegiance
and
the
magistrates
represented
to
the
people
as
despots
since
the
people
brutal
and
ignorant
only
see
the
evil
and
never
the
good
of
things
the
writer
explains
they
must
be
given
only
limited
power
in
the
municipalities
let
us
beware
above
all
of
giving
them
too
much
force
their
despotism
is
too
dangerous
we
must
flatter
the
people
by
gratuitous
justice
promise
them
a
great
diminution
in
taxes
and
a
more
equal
division
more
extension
in
fortunes
and
less
humiliation
these
phantasies
will
fanaticise
the
people
who
will
flatten
out
all
resistance
what
matter
the
victims
and
their
numbers
spoliations
destructions
burnings
and
all
the
necessary
effects
of
a
revolution
nothing
must
be
sacred
and
we
can
say
with
machiavelli
what
matter
the
means
as
long
as
one
arrives
at
the
end
were
all
these
the
ideas
of
mirabeau
or
were
they
like
the
other
document
of
the
illuminati
found
amongst
his
papers
the
programme
of
a
conspiracy
i
incline
to
the
latter
theory
the
plan
of
campaign
was
at
any
rate
the
one
followed
out
by
the
conspirators
as
chamfort
the
friend
and
confidant
of
mirabeau
admitted
in
his
conversation
with
marmontel
the
nation
is
a
great
herd
that
only
thinks
of
browsing
and
with
good
sheepdogs
the
shepherds
can
lead
it
as
they
please
money
and
the
hope
of
plunder
are
with
the
people
mirabeau
cheerfully
asserts
that
with
louis
one
can
make
quite
a
good
riot
another
contemporary
thus
describes
the
methods
of
the
leaders
mirabeau
in
the
exuberance
of
an
orgy
cried
one
day
that
well
deserves
to
have
us
for
legislators
these
professions
of
faith
as
we
see
are
not
at
all
democratic
the
sect
uses
the
populace
as
revolution
fodder
à
as
prime
material
for
brigandage
after
which
it
seizes
the
gold
and
abandons
generations
to
torture
it
is
veritably
the
code
of
hell
it
is
this
code
of
hell
set
forth
in
the
projet
de
révolution
that
we
shall
find
repeated
in
succeeding
documents
throughout
the
last
hundred
years
in
the
correspondence
of
the
alta
vendita
in
the
aux
enfers
entre
machiavel
et
by
maurice
joly
in
the
revolutionary
catechism
of
bakunin
in
the
protocols
of
the
elders
of
zion
and
in
the
writings
of
the
russian
bolsheviks
whatever
doubts
may
be
cast
on
the
authenticity
of
any
of
these
documents
the
indisputable
fact
thus
remains
that
as
early
as
this
machiavellian
plan
of
engineering
revolution
and
using
the
people
as
a
lever
for
raising
a
tyrannical
minority
to
power
had
been
formulated
further
that
the
methods
described
in
this
earliest
protocol
have
been
carried
out
according
to
plan
from
that
day
to
this
and
in
every
outbreak
of
the
social
revolution
the
authors
of
the
movement
have
been
known
to
be
connected
with
secret
societies
it
was
adrien
duport
author
of
the
great
fear
that
spread
over
france
on
july
duport
the
inner
initiate
of
the
secret
societies
holding
in
his
hands
all
the
threads
of
the
masonic
conspiracy
who
on
may
set
forth
before
the
committee
of
propaganda
the
vast
scheme
of
destruction
de
mirabeau
has
well
established
the
fact
that
the
fortunate
revolution
which
has
taken
place
in
france
must
and
will
be
for
all
the
peoples
of
europe
the
awakening
of
liberty
and
for
kings
the
sleep
of
death
but
duport
goes
on
to
explain
that
whilst
mirabeau
thinks
it
advisable
at
present
not
to
concern
themselves
with
anything
outside
france
he
himself
believes
that
the
triumph
of
the
french
revolution
must
lead
inevitably
to
the
ruin
of
all
thrones
therefore
we
must
hasten
among
our
neighbours
the
same
revolution
that
is
going
on
in
france
the
plan
of
illuminized
freemasonry
was
thus
nothing
less
than
it
is
necessary
here
to
reply
to
a
critic
who
suggested
that
in
emphasizing
the
rôle
of
the
secret
societies
in
i
had
abandoned
my
former
thesis
of
the
orléaniste
conspiracy
i
wish
therefore
to
state
that
i
do
not
retract
one
word
i
wrote
in
french
on
the
orléaniste
conspiracy
i
merely
supply
a
further
explanation
of
its
efficiency
by
enlarging
on
the
aid
it
received
from
the
party
i
referred
to
as
the
subversives
outcome
of
the
masonic
lodges
it
was
because
the
orléanistes
held
the
whole
masonic
organization
at
their
disposal
that
they
were
able
to
carry
out
their
plans
with
such
extraordinary
skill
and
thoroughness
and
because
they
had
at
their
back
men
bent
solely
on
destruction
that
they
could
enlist
a
following
which
would
not
have
rallied
to
a
mere
scheme
of
usurpation
even
montjoie
who
saw
in
the
revolution
principally
the
work
of
the
duc
indicates
in
a
very
curious
passage
of
a
later
work
the
existence
of
the
still
darker
intrigue
behind
the
conspiracy
he
had
spent
his
energies
in
unveiling
i
will
not
examine
whether
this
wicked
prince
thinking
he
was
acting
in
his
personal
interests
was
not
moved
by
that
invisible
hand
which
seems
to
have
created
all
the
events
of
our
revolution
in
order
to
lead
us
towards
a
goal
that
we
do
not
see
at
present
but
which
i
think
we
shall
see
before
long
unfortunately
after
this
mysterious
utterance
montjoie
never
again
returns
to
the
subject
at
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
orléanism
and
freemasonry
thus
formed
a
united
body
according
to
lombard
de
langres
france
in
counted
more
than
lodges
affiliated
to
the
grand
orient
the
number
of
adepts
was
more
than
the
first
events
of
were
only
masonry
in
action
all
the
revolutionaries
of
the
constituent
assembly
were
initiated
into
the
third
degree
we
place
in
this
class
the
duc
valence
syllery
laclos
sièyes
pétion
menou
biron
montesquieu
fauchet
condorcet
lafayette
mirabeau
garat
rabaud
thiébaud
larochefoucauld
and
others
amongst
these
others
were
not
only
the
brissotins
who
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
girondin
party
but
the
men
of
the
terror
marat
robespierre
danton
and
desmoulins
it
was
these
fiercer
elements
true
disciples
of
the
illuminati
who
were
to
sweep
away
the
visionary
masons
dreaming
of
equality
and
brotherhood
following
the
precedent
set
by
weishaupt
classical
pseudonyms
were
adopted
by
these
leaders
of
the
jacobins
thus
chaumette
was
known
as
anaxagoras
clootz
as
anacharsis
danton
as
horace
lacroix
as
publicola
and
ronsin
as
scaevola
again
after
the
manner
of
the
illuminati
the
names
of
towns
were
changed
and
a
revolutionary
calendar
was
adopted
the
red
cap
and
loose
hair
affected
by
the
jacobins
appear
also
to
have
been
foreshadowed
in
the
lodges
of
the
illuminati
yet
faithfully
as
the
terrorists
carried
out
the
plan
of
the
illuminati
it
would
seem
that
they
themselves
were
not
initiated
into
the
innermost
secrets
of
the
conspiracy
behind
the
convention
behind
the
clubs
behind
the
revolutionary
tribunal
there
existed
says
lombard
de
langres
that
most
secret
convention
which
directed
everything
after
may
an
occult
and
terrible
power
of
which
the
other
convention
became
the
slave
and
which
was
composed
of
the
prime
initiates
of
illuminism
this
power
was
above
robespierre
and
the
committees
of
the
government
it
was
this
occult
power
which
appropriated
to
itself
the
treasures
of
the
nation
and
distributed
them
to
the
brothers
and
friends
who
had
helped
on
the
great
work
what
was
the
aim
of
this
occult
power
was
it
merely
the
plan
of
destruction
that
had
originated
in
the
brain
of
a
bavarian
professor
twenty
years
earlier
or
was
it
something
far
older
a
live
and
terrible
force
that
had
lain
dormant
through
the
centuries
that
weishaupt
and
his
allies
had
not
created
but
only
loosed
upon
the
world
the
reign
of
terror
like
the
outbreak
of
satanism
in
the
middle
ages
can
be
explained
by
no
material
causes
the
orgy
of
hatred
lust
and
cruelty
directed
not
only
against
the
rich
but
still
more
against
the
poor
and
defenceless
the
destruction
of
science
art
and
beauty
the
desecration
of
the
churches
the
organized
campaign
against
all
that
was
noble
all
that
was
sacred
all
that
humanity
holds
dear
what
was
this
but
satanism
in
desecrating
the
churches
and
stamping
on
the
crucifixes
the
jacobins
had
in
fact
followed
the
precise
formula
of
black
magic
for
the
purpose
of
infernal
evocation
it
is
requisite
to
profane
the
ceremonies
of
the
religion
to
which
one
belongs
and
to
trample
its
holiest
symbols
under
foot
it
was
this
that
formed
the
prelude
to
the
great
terror
when
to
those
who
lived
through
it
it
seemed
that
france
lay
under
the
sway
of
the
powers
of
darkness
so
in
the
great
shipwreck
of
civilization
as
a
contemporary
has
described
it
the
projects
of
the
cabalists
the
gnostics
and
the
secret
societies
which
for
nearly
eighteen
centuries
had
sapped
the
foundations
of
christianity
found
their
fulfilment
do
we
not
detect
an
echo
of
the
toledot
yeshu
in
the
blasphemies
of
the
marquis
de
sade
concerning
the
jewish
slave
and
the
adulterous
woman
the
courtesan
of
galilee
and
in
the
imprecations
of
marat
worshippers
christ
was
a
false
prophet
a
repetition
of
the
secret
doctrine
attributed
to
the
templars
jesus
is
not
the
true
god
he
is
a
false
prophet
he
was
not
crucified
for
the
salvation
of
humanity
but
for
his
own
misdeeds
are
these
resemblances
accidental
or
are
they
the
outcome
of
a
continuous
plot
against
the
christian
faith
what
then
was
the
rôle
of
jews
in
the
revolution
in
this
connexion
it
is
necessary
to
understand
the
situation
of
the
jews
in
france
at
this
period
after
the
decree
of
banishment
issued
by
charles
vi
in
jewry
as
a
body
had
ceased
to
exist
but
towards
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
a
certain
number
of
jews
driven
out
of
spain
and
portugal
were
allowed
to
settle
in
bordeaux
these
spanish
and
portuguese
jews
known
as
appeared
to
acquiesce
in
the
christian
religion
and
were
not
officially
regarded
as
jews
but
enjoyed
considerable
privileges
conferred
on
them
by
henri
ii
it
was
not
until
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
during
the
regency
that
jews
began
to
reappear
in
paris
meanwhile
the
annexation
of
alsace
at
the
end
of
the
previous
century
had
added
to
the
population
of
france
the
german
jews
of
that
province
known
as
the
it
is
important
to
distinguish
between
these
two
races
of
jews
in
discussing
the
question
of
jewish
emancipation
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
for
whilst
the
sephardim
had
shown
themselves
good
citizens
and
were
therefore
subject
to
no
persecutions
the
ashkenazim
by
their
extortionate
usury
and
oppressions
had
made
themselves
detested
by
the
people
so
that
rigorous
laws
were
enforced
to
restrain
their
rapacity
the
discussions
that
raged
in
the
national
assembly
on
the
subject
of
the
jewish
question
related
therefore
mainly
to
the
jews
of
alsace
already
in
the
jews
of
bordeaux
had
been
accorded
further
concessions
by
louis
xvi
in
all
portuguese
jews
had
been
given
religious
liberty
and
the
permission
to
inhabit
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
the
decree
of
january
conferring
on
the
jews
of
bordeaux
the
rights
of
french
citizens
put
the
finishing
touch
to
this
scheme
of
liberation
but
the
proposal
to
extend
this
privilege
to
the
jews
of
alsace
evoked
a
storm
of
controversy
in
the
assembly
and
also
violent
insurrections
amongst
the
alsatian
peasants
it
was
thus
on
behalf
of
the
people
that
several
deputies
protested
against
the
decree
the
jews
said
the
abbé
maury
have
traversed
seventeen
centuries
without
mingling
with
other
nations
they
have
never
done
anything
but
trade
with
money
they
have
been
the
scourge
of
agricultural
provinces
not
one
of
them
has
known
how
to
ennoble
his
hands
by
guiding
the
plough
and
he
went
on
to
point
out
that
the
jews
must
not
be
persecuted
they
must
be
protected
as
individuals
and
not
as
frenchmen
since
they
can
not
be
citizens
whatever
you
do
they
will
always
remain
foreigners
in
our
midst
monseigneur
de
la
fare
bishop
of
nancy
adopted
the
same
line
of
argument
they
must
be
accorded
protection
safety
liberty
but
should
we
admit
into
the
family
a
tribe
that
is
foreign
to
it
that
turns
its
eyes
unceasingly
towards
a
common
country
that
aspires
to
abandon
the
land
that
bears
it
my
orders
me
to
protest
against
the
motion
that
has
been
made
to
you
the
interest
of
the
jews
themselves
necessitates
this
protest
the
people
have
a
horror
of
them
they
are
often
in
alsace
the
victims
of
popular
risings
in
all
this
as
will
be
seen
there
is
no
question
of
persecution
but
of
precautions
against
a
race
that
wilfully
isolates
itself
from
the
rest
of
the
community
in
order
to
pursue
its
own
interests
and
advantages
the
jews
of
bordeaux
indeed
recognized
the
odium
that
the
german
jews
were
calculated
to
bring
on
the
jewish
cause
and
in
an
address
to
the
assembly
on
january
dissociated
themselves
from
the
aggressive
claims
of
the
ashkenazim
we
dare
to
believe
that
our
condition
in
france
would
not
be
open
to
discussion
if
certain
demands
of
the
jews
of
alsace
lorraine
and
the
trois
evêchés
metz
toul
and
verdun
had
not
caused
a
confusion
of
ideas
which
appears
to
reflect
on
us
we
do
not
yet
know
exactly
what
these
demands
are
but
to
judge
by
the
public
papers
they
appear
to
be
rather
extraordinary
since
these
jews
aspire
to
live
in
france
under
a
special
régime
to
have
laws
peculiar
to
themselves
and
to
constitute
a
class
of
citizens
separated
from
all
the
others
as
for
us
our
condition
in
france
has
long
since
been
settled
we
have
been
naturalized
french
since
we
possess
all
kinds
of
properties
and
we
enjoy
the
unlimited
right
to
acquire
estates
we
have
neither
laws
tribunals
nor
officers
of
our
own
in
adopting
this
attitude
the
sephardim
created
a
precedent
which
if
it
had
been
followed
henceforth
consistently
by
their
might
have
gone
far
to
allay
prejudice
against
the
jewish
race
it
was
the
solidarity
generally
presented
by
the
jews
towards
the
rest
of
the
community
which
excited
alarm
in
the
minds
of
french
citizens
thirty
years
earlier
the
merchants
of
paris
in
a
petition
against
the
admission
of
the
jews
to
their
corporations
indicated
by
an
admirable
simile
the
danger
this
solidarity
offered
to
free
commerce
the
french
merchant
carries
on
his
commerce
alone
each
commercial
house
is
in
a
way
isolated
whilst
the
jews
are
particles
of
quicksilver
which
at
the
least
slant
run
together
into
a
block
but
in
spite
of
all
protests
the
decree
emancipating
the
jews
of
alsace
was
passed
in
september
and
hymns
of
praise
were
sung
in
the
synagogues
what
part
was
actually
played
by
the
jews
in
the
tumults
of
the
revolution
it
is
impossible
to
determine
for
the
reason
that
they
are
seldom
designated
as
such
in
the
writings
of
contemporaries
on
this
point
jewish
writers
appear
to
be
better
informed
than
the
rest
of
the
world
for
monsieur
léon
kahn
in
his
panegyric
on
the
part
played
by
his
in
the
revolution
finds
jews
where
even
drumont
failed
to
detect
them
thus
we
read
that
it
was
a
jew
rosenthal
who
headed
the
legion
known
by
his
name
which
was
sent
against
la
vendée
but
took
to
flight
and
which
was
the
subject
of
complaint
when
employed
to
guard
the
royal
family
at
the
temple
that
amongst
those
who
worked
most
energetically
to
deprive
the
clergy
of
their
goods
was
a
jewish
seller
zalkind
hourwitz
that
it
was
a
jew
named
lang
who
murdered
three
out
of
the
five
swiss
guards
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
in
the
tuileries
on
august
that
jews
were
implicated
in
the
theft
of
the
crown
jewels
on
september
and
one
named
lyre
was
executed
in
consequence
that
it
was
clootz
and
the
jew
pereyra
and
not
as
i
had
stated
hébert
chaumette
and
momoro
who
went
to
the
archbishop
gobel
in
november
and
induced
him
by
means
of
threats
to
abjure
the
christian
faith
all
these
facts
were
unknown
to
me
when
i
wrote
my
account
of
these
events
it
will
be
seen
then
that
far
from
exaggerating
the
rôle
of
the
jews
in
french
i
very
much
underrated
it
indeed
the
question
of
their
complicity
had
not
occurred
to
me
at
all
when
i
wrote
this
book
and
the
only
jew
to
whom
i
referred
was
ephraïm
sent
to
france
by
the
illuminati
frederick
william
ii
and
bischoffswerder
whom
kahn
indicates
as
playing
an
even
more
important
part
than
i
had
assigned
to
him
but
illuminating
as
these
incidents
may
be
it
is
yet
open
to
question
whether
they
prove
any
concerted
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
jews
to
bring
about
the
overthrow
of
the
french
monarchy
and
the
catholic
religion
it
is
true
nevertheless
that
they
themselves
boasted
of
their
revolutionary
ardour
in
an
address
presenting
their
claims
before
the
national
assembly
in
they
declare
regenerators
of
the
french
empire
you
would
not
wish
that
we
should
cease
to
be
citizens
since
for
already
six
months
we
have
assiduously
performed
all
duties
as
such
and
the
recompense
for
the
zeal
we
have
shown
in
accelerating
the
revolution
will
not
be
to
condemn
us
to
participate
in
none
of
its
advantages
now
that
it
has
been
consummated
nosseigneurs
we
are
all
very
good
citizens
and
in
this
memorable
revolution
we
dare
to
say
that
there
is
not
one
of
us
who
has
not
proved
himself
in
all
these
activities
however
religious
feeling
appears
to
have
played
an
entirely
subordinate
part
the
jews
as
has
been
said
were
free
before
the
revolution
to
carry
on
the
rites
of
their
faith
and
when
the
great
campaign
began
many
of
them
entered
into
the
attack
on
all
religious
faiths
their
own
included
thus
on
the
brumaire
whilst
the
feasts
of
reason
were
taking
place
in
the
churches
of
paris
we
find
a
deputation
of
israelites
presenting
themselves
at
the
national
assembly
and
depositing
on
the
bosom
of
the
mountain
the
ornaments
of
which
they
had
stripped
a
little
temple
they
had
in
the
faubourg
at
the
same
moment
a
revolutionary
committee
of
the
réunion
brings
to
the
general
council
crosses
suns
chalices
copes
and
quantities
of
other
ornaments
of
worship
and
a
member
of
this
committee
observes
that
several
of
these
effects
belong
to
individuals
of
the
jewish
race
a
minister
of
the
religion
of
moses
abraham
and
jacob
asks
in
the
name
of
his
that
the
said
effects
should
not
be
regarded
as
belonging
to
such
and
such
a
sect
this
citizen
is
named
benjamin
jacob
another
member
of
the
same
committee
pays
homage
to
the
patriotic
zeal
of
the
citizens
heretofore
jews
almost
all
have
forestalled
the
wish
of
the
revolutionary
committee
by
themselves
bringing
their
reliquaries
and
ornaments
amongst
others
the
famous
cope
said
to
have
belonged
to
moses
on
the
frimaire
at
the
temple
of
liberty
formerly
the
church
of
the
benedictines
the
citizen
alexandre
lambert
a
jew
brought
up
in
the
prejudices
of
the
jewish
religion
uttered
a
violent
harangue
against
all
religions
i
will
prove
to
you
citizens
that
all
forms
of
worship
are
impostures
equally
degrading
to
man
and
to
divinities
i
will
not
prove
it
by
philosophy
i
do
not
know
it
but
only
by
the
light
of
reason
after
denouncing
the
iniquities
of
both
the
catholic
and
protestant
faiths
lambert
demonstrates
the
absurdities
of
the
jewish
religion
of
this
domineering
religion
he
thunders
against
moses
governing
a
simple
and
agrarian
people
like
all
clever
impostors
against
the
servile
respect
of
the
jews
for
their
kings
the
ablutions
of
women
etc
finally
he
declares
the
bad
faith
citizens
of
which
the
jewish
nation
is
accused
does
not
come
from
themselves
but
from
their
priests
their
religion
which
would
allow
them
only
to
lend
to
those
of
their
nation
at
per
tells
them
to
take
all
they
can
from
catholics
it
is
even
hallowed
as
a
custom
in
our
morning
prayers
to
solicit
help
in
catching
out
a
christian
there
is
more
citizens
and
it
is
the
climax
of
abomination
if
any
mistake
is
made
in
commerce
between
jews
they
are
ordered
to
make
reparation
but
if
on
louis
a
christian
should
have
paid
too
much
one
is
not
bound
to
return
them
to
him
what
an
abomination
what
a
horror
and
where
does
that
all
come
from
but
from
the
rabbis
who
have
excited
proscriptions
against
us
our
priests
ah
citizens
more
than
anything
in
the
world
we
must
abjure
a
religion
which
by
subjecting
us
to
irksome
and
servile
practices
makes
it
impossible
for
us
to
be
good
citizens
the
encouragement
accorded
by
the
jews
to
the
french
revolution
appears
thus
to
have
been
prompted
not
by
religious
fanaticism
but
by
a
desire
for
national
advantage
that
they
gained
immensely
by
the
overthrow
of
the
old
order
is
undeniable
for
apart
from
the
legislation
passed
on
their
behalf
in
the
national
assembly
the
disorder
of
the
finances
in
was
such
that
as
leon
kahn
tells
us
a
contemporary
journal
enquired
has
the
revolution
then
been
only
a
financial
scheme
a
speculation
of
bankers
we
know
from
prudhomme
to
what
race
the
financiers
who
principally
profited
by
this
disorder
belonged
but
if
the
rôle
of
the
jews
in
the
revolution
remains
obscure
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
part
played
by
the
secret
societies
in
the
revolt
against
all
religion
all
moral
laws
and
social
order
which
had
been
reduced
to
a
system
in
the
councils
of
the
illuminati
it
was
this
conspiracy
that
reasserted
itself
in
the
babouviste
rising
of
which
was
directly
inspired
by
the
secret
societies
after
the
death
of
babeuf
his
friend
and
inspirer
buonarotti
with
the
aid
of
marat
brother
founded
a
masonic
lodge
the
which
was
affiliated
to
the
at
geneva
and
as
diacre
mobile
of
the
order
of
sublime
and
perfect
masons
created
three
new
secret
degrees
in
which
the
device
of
the
was
interpreted
as
signifying
justum
necare
reges
injustos
the
part
to
be
assigned
to
each
intrigue
in
preparing
the
of
which
the
french
revolution
was
the
first
expression
is
a
question
on
which
no
one
can
speak
with
certainty
but
as
at
the
present
moment
the
composite
nature
of
this
movement
must
never
be
lost
to
sight
largely
perhaps
the
work
of
frederick
the
great
it
is
probable
that
but
for
the
orléanistes
the
plot
against
the
french
monarchy
might
have
come
to
nought
whilst
again
but
for
his
position
at
the
head
of
illuminized
freemasonry
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
duc
could
have
commanded
the
forces
of
revolution
further
how
far
the
movement
which
like
the
modern
bolshevist
conspiracy
appears
to
have
had
unlimited
funds
at
its
disposal
was
financed
by
the
jews
yet
remains
to
be
discovered
hitherto
only
the
first
steps
have
been
taken
towards
elucidating
the
truth
about
the
french
revolution
in
the
opinion
of
an
early
writer
the
sect
which
engineered
the
french
revolution
was
absolutely
international
the
authors
of
the
revolution
are
not
more
french
than
german
italian
english
etc
they
form
a
particular
nation
which
took
birth
and
has
grown
in
the
darkness
in
the
midst
of
all
civilized
nations
with
the
object
of
subjecting
them
to
its
domination
it
is
curious
to
find
almost
precisely
the
same
idea
expressed
by
the
duke
of
brunswick
formerly
the
eques
a
victoria
of
the
stricte
observance
aaron
of
the
illuminati
and
grand
master
of
german
freemasonry
who
whether
because
the
revolution
had
done
its
work
in
destroying
the
french
monarchy
and
now
threatened
the
security
of
germany
or
whether
because
he
was
genuinely
disillusioned
in
the
orders
to
which
he
had
belonged
issued
a
manifesto
to
all
the
lodges
in
declaring
that
in
view
of
the
way
in
which
masonry
had
been
penetrated
by
this
great
sect
the
whole
order
must
be
temporarily
suppressed
it
is
essential
to
quote
a
part
of
this
important
document
verbatim
amidst
the
universal
storm
produced
by
the
present
revolutions
in
the
political
and
moral
world
at
this
period
of
supreme
illumination
and
of
profound
blindness
it
would
be
a
crime
against
truth
and
humanity
to
leave
any
longer
shrouded
in
a
veil
things
that
can
provide
the
only
key
to
past
and
future
events
things
that
should
show
to
thousands
of
men
whether
the
path
they
have
been
made
to
follow
is
the
path
of
folly
or
of
wisdom
it
has
to
do
with
you
vv
ff
of
all
degrees
and
of
all
secret
systems
the
curtain
must
at
last
be
drawn
aside
so
that
your
blinded
eyes
may
see
that
light
you
have
ever
sought
in
vain
but
of
which
you
have
only
caught
a
few
deceptive
rays
we
have
raised
our
building
under
the
wings
of
darkness
the
darkness
is
dispelled
and
a
light
more
terrifying
than
darkness
itself
strikes
suddenly
on
our
sight
we
see
our
edifice
crumbling
and
covering
the
ground
with
ruins
we
see
destruction
that
our
hands
can
no
longer
arrest
and
that
is
why
we
send
away
the
builders
from
their
workshops
with
a
last
blow
of
the
hammer
we
overthrow
the
columns
of
salaries
we
leave
the
temple
deserted
and
we
bequeath
it
as
a
great
work
to
posterity
which
shall
raise
it
again
on
its
ruins
and
bring
it
to
completion
brunswick
then
goes
on
to
explain
what
has
brought
about
the
ruin
of
the
order
namely
the
infiltration
of
freemasonry
by
secret
conspirators
a
great
sect
arose
which
taking
for
its
motto
the
good
and
the
happiness
of
man
worked
in
the
darkness
of
the
conspiracy
to
make
the
happiness
of
humanity
a
prey
for
itself
this
sect
is
known
to
everyone
its
brothers
are
known
no
less
than
its
name
it
is
they
who
have
undermined
the
foundations
of
the
order
to
the
point
of
complete
overthrow
it
is
by
them
that
all
humanity
has
been
poisoned
and
led
astray
for
several
generations
the
ferment
that
reigns
amongst
the
peoples
is
their
work
they
founded
the
plans
of
their
insatiable
ambition
on
the
political
pride
of
nations
their
founders
arranged
to
introduce
this
pride
into
the
heads
of
the
peoples
they
began
by
casting
odium
on
religion
they
invented
the
rights
of
man
which
it
is
impossible
to
discover
even
in
the
book
of
nature
and
they
urged
the
people
to
wrest
from
their
princes
the
recognition
of
these
supposed
rights
the
plan
they
had
formed
for
breaking
all
social
ties
and
of
destroying
all
order
was
revealed
in
all
their
speeches
and
acts
they
deluged
the
world
with
a
multitude
of
publications
they
recruited
apprentices
of
every
rank
and
in
every
position
they
deluded
the
most
perspicacious
men
by
falsely
alleging
different
intentions
they
sowed
in
the
hearts
of
youth
the
seed
of
covetousness
and
they
excited
it
with
the
bait
of
the
most
insatiable
passions
indomitable
pride
thirst
of
power
such
were
the
only
motives
of
this
sect
their
masters
had
nothing
less
in
view
than
the
thrones
of
the
earth
and
the
government
of
the
nations
was
to
be
directed
by
their
nocturnal
clubs
this
is
what
has
been
done
and
is
still
being
done
but
we
notice
that
princes
and
people
are
unaware
how
and
by
what
means
this
is
being
accomplished
that
is
why
we
say
to
them
in
all
frankness
the
misuse
of
our
order
the
misunderstanding
of
our
secret
has
produced
all
the
political
and
moral
troubles
with
which
the
world
is
filled
you
who
have
been
initiated
you
must
join
yourselves
with
us
in
raising
your
voices
so
as
to
teach
peoples
and
princes
that
the
sectarians
the
apostates
of
our
order
have
alone
been
and
will
be
the
authors
of
present
and
future
revolutions
we
must
assure
princes
and
peoples
on
our
honour
and
our
duty
that
our
association
is
in
no
way
guilty
of
these
evils
but
in
order
that
our
attestations
should
have
force
and
merit
belief
we
must
make
for
princes
and
people
a
complete
sacrifice
so
as
to
cut
out
to
the
roots
the
abuse
and
error
we
must
from
this
moment
dissolve
the
whole
order
this
is
why
we
destroy
and
annihilate
it
completely
for
the
time
we
will
preserve
the
foundations
for
posterity
which
will
clear
them
when
humanity
in
better
times
can
derive
some
benefit
from
our
holy
alliance
thus
in
the
opinion
of
the
grand
master
of
german
freemasonry
a
secret
sect
working
within
freemasonry
had
brought
about
the
french
revolution
and
would
be
the
cause
of
all
future
revolutions
we
shall
now
pursue
the
course
of
this
sect
after
the
first
upheaval
had
ended
three
years
after
the
duke
of
brunswick
issued
his
manifesto
to
the
lodges
the
books
of
barruel
robison
and
others
appeared
laying
bare
the
whole
conspiracy
it
has
been
said
that
all
these
books
fell
flat
this
is
directly
contrary
to
the
truth
barruel
book
went
into
no
less
than
eight
editions
and
i
have
described
elsewhere
the
alarm
that
his
work
and
robison
excited
in
america
in
england
they
led
to
the
very
tangible
result
that
a
law
was
passed
by
the
english
parliament
in
prohibiting
all
secret
societies
with
the
exception
of
freemasonry
it
is
evident
then
that
the
british
government
recognized
the
continued
existence
of
these
associations
and
the
danger
they
presented
to
the
world
this
fact
should
be
borne
in
mind
when
we
are
assured
that
barruel
and
robison
had
conjured
up
a
bogey
which
met
with
no
serious
attention
from
responsible
men
for
the
main
purpose
of
barruel
book
is
to
show
that
not
only
had
illuminism
and
grand
orient
masonry
contributed
largely
to
the
french
revolution
but
that
three
years
after
that
first
explosion
they
were
still
as
active
as
ever
this
is
the
great
point
which
the
champions
of
the
bogey
theory
are
most
anxious
to
refute
the
bavarian
order
of
the
illuminati
wrote
waite
was
founded
by
adam
weishaupt
in
and
it
was
suppressed
by
the
elector
of
bavaria
in
those
who
say
that
was
continued
in
more
secret
forms
have
never
produced
one
item
of
real
evidence
now
as
we
have
seen
the
illuminati
were
not
suppressed
by
the
elector
of
bavaria
in
but
in
first
error
of
waite
but
more
extraordinary
confusion
of
mind
is
displayed
in
his
of
where
in
a
masonic
chronology
he
gives
this
time
under
the
date
of
suppression
of
the
illuminati
but
under
bode
joined
the
illuminati
under
weishaupt
at
a
matter
of
fact
this
was
the
year
bode
died
these
examples
will
serve
to
show
the
reliance
that
can
be
placed
on
waite
statement
concerning
the
illuminati
we
shall
now
see
that
not
only
the
illuminati
but
weishaupt
himself
still
continued
to
intrigue
long
after
the
french
revolution
had
ended
directly
the
reign
of
terror
was
over
the
masonic
lodges
which
during
the
revolution
had
been
replaced
by
the
clubs
began
to
reopen
and
by
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
were
in
a
more
flourishing
condition
than
ever
before
it
was
the
most
brilliant
epoch
of
masonry
wrote
the
freemason
bazot
in
his
history
of
freemasonry
nearly
lodges
existed
in
france
under
the
empire
generals
magistrates
artists
savants
and
notabilities
in
every
line
were
initiated
into
the
order
the
most
eminent
of
these
was
prince
cambacérès
pro
grand
master
of
the
grand
orient
it
is
in
the
midst
of
this
period
that
we
find
weishaupt
once
more
at
work
behind
the
scenes
of
freemasonry
thus
in
the
remarkable
masonic
correspondence
published
by
benjamin
fabre
in
his
a
capite
of
which
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
the
authenticity
is
admitted
by
eminent
british
freemasons
a
letter
is
reproduced
from
pyron
representative
in
paris
of
the
grand
orient
of
italy
to
the
marquis
de
chefdebien
dated
september
in
which
it
is
stated
that
a
member
of
the
sect
of
bav
has
asked
for
information
on
a
certain
point
of
ritual
on
december

the
words

w
and
on
december
puts
the
matter
quite
plainly
the
other
word
remaining
at
the
end
of
my
pen
refers
enigmatically
to
so
as
fabre
points
out
there
is
no
longer
any
doubt
that
it
is
a
question
here
of
weishaupt
and
yet
one
observes
that
his
name
is
not
yet
written
in
all
its
letters
it
must
be
admitted
here
that
pyron
took
great
precautions
when
it
was
a
matter
of
weishaupt
and
one
is
led
to
ask
what
could
be
the
extraordinary
importance
of
the
rôle
played
at
this
moment
in
the
freemasonry
of
the
first
empire
by
this
weishaupt
who
was
supposed
to
have
been
outside
the
masonic
movement
since
illuminism
was
brought
to
trial
in
but
the
marquis
de
chefdebien
entertained
no
illusions
about
weishaupt
whose
intrigues
he
had
always
opposed
and
in
a
letter
dated
may
to
the
freemason
roettiers
who
had
referred
to
the
danger
of
isolated
masonic
lodges
he
asks
in
good
faith
very
reverend
brother
is
it
in
isolated
lodges
that
the
atrocious
conspiracy
of
philippe
the
duc
and
robespierre
was
formed
is
it
from
isolated
lodges
that
those
prominent
men
came
forth
who
assembled
at
the
hôtel
de
ville
stirred
up
revolt
devastation
assassination
and
is
it
not
in
the
lodges
bound
together
that
the
monster
weishaupt
established
his
tests
and
had
his
horrible
principles
prepared
if
then
as
gustave
bord
asserts
the
marquis
de
chefdebien
had
himself
belonged
to
the
illuminati
before
the
revolution
here
is
indeed
illuminist
evidence
in
support
of
barruel
yet
disillusioned
as
the
eques
a
capite
galeato
appears
to
have
been
with
regard
to
illuminism
he
still
retained
his
allegiance
to
freemasonry
this
would
tend
to
prove
that
however
subversive
the
doctrines
of
the
grand
orient
may
have
been
and
indeed
undoubtedly
were
it
was
not
freemasonry
itself
but
illuminism
which
organized
the
movement
of
which
the
french
revolution
was
the
first
manifestation
as
monsignor
dillon
has
expressed
it
had
weishaupt
not
lived
masonry
might
have
ceased
to
be
a
power
after
the
reaction
consequent
on
the
french
revolution
he
gave
it
a
form
and
character
which
caused
it
to
outlive
that
reaction
to
energize
to
the
present
day
and
which
will
cause
it
to
advance
until
its
final
conflict
with
christianity
must
determine
whether
christ
or
satan
shall
reign
on
this
earth
to
the
end
if
to
the
word
masonry
we
add
grand
orient
that
is
to
say
the
masonry
not
of
great
britain
but
of
the
continent
we
shall
be
still
nearer
to
the
truth
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
illuminism
was
thus
as
much
alive
as
ever
joseph
de
maistre
writing
at
this
period
constantly
refers
to
the
danger
it
presents
to
europe
is
it
not
also
to
illuminism
that
a
mysterious
passage
in
a
recent
work
of
lenôtre
refers
in
the
course
of
conversation
with
the
friends
of
the
false
dauphin
hervagault
monsignor
de
savine
is
said
to
have
made
allusions
in
prudent
and
almost
terrified
terms
to
some
international
sect
a
power
superior
to
all
others
which
has
arms
and
eyes
everywhere
and
which
governs
europe
when
in
i
asserted
that
during
the
period
that
napoleon
held
the
reins
of
power
the
devastating
fire
of
illuminism
was
temporarily
extinguished
i
wrote
without
knowledge
of
some
important
documents
which
prove
that
illuminism
continued
without
break
from
the
date
of
its
foundation
all
through
the
period
of
the
empire
so
far
then
from
overstating
the
case
by
saying
that
illuminism
did
not
cease
in
i
understated
it
by
suggesting
that
it
ceased
even
for
this
brief
interval
the
documents
in
which
this
evidence
is
to
be
found
are
referred
to
by
lombard
de
langres
who
writing
in
observes
that
the
jacobins
were
invisible
from
the
brumaire
until
and
goes
on
to
say
here
the
sect
disappears
we
find
to
guide
us
during
this
period
only
uncertain
notions
scattered
fragments
the
plots
of
illuminism
lie
buried
in
the
boxes
of
the
imperial
police
but
the
contents
of
these
boxes
no
longer
lie
buried
transported
to
the
archives
nationales
the
documents
in
which
the
intrigues
of
illuminism
are
laid
bare
have
at
last
been
given
to
the
public
here
there
can
be
no
question
of
imaginative
abbés
scotch
professors
or
american
divines
conjuring
up
a
bogey
to
alarm
the
world
these
dry
official
reports
prepared
for
the
vigilant
eye
of
the
emperor
never
intended
and
never
used
for
publication
relate
calmly
and
dispassionately
what
the
writers
have
themselves
heard
and
observed
concerning
the
danger
that
illuminism
presents
to
all
forms
of
settled
government
the
author
of
the
most
detailed
report
is
one
françois
charles
de
berckheim
special
commissioner
of
police
at
mayence
towards
the
end
of
the
empire
who
as
a
freemason
is
naturally
not
disposed
to
prejudice
against
secret
societies
in
october
he
writes
however
that
his
attention
has
been
drawn
to
the
illuminati
by
a
pamphlet
which
has
just
fallen
into
his
hands
namely
the
sur
la
secte
des
which
like
many
contemporaries
he
attributes
originally
to
mirabeau
he
then
goes
on
to
ask
whether
the
sect
still
exists
and
if
so
whether
it
is
indeed
an
association
of
frightful
scoundrels
who
aim
as
mirabeau
assures
us
at
the
overthrow
of
all
law
and
all
morality
at
replacing
virtue
by
crime
in
every
act
of
human
life
further
he
asks
whether
both
sects
of
have
now
combined
in
one
and
what
are
their
present
projects
conversations
with
other
freemasons
further
increase
berckheim
anxiety
on
the
subject
one
of
the
best
informed
observes
to
him
i
know
a
great
deal
enough
at
any
rate
to
be
convinced
that
the
have
vowed
the
overthrow
of
monarchic
governments
and
of
all
authority
on
the
same
basis
berckheim
thereupon
sets
out
to
make
enquiries
with
the
result
that
he
is
able
to
state
that
the
have
initiates
all
over
europe
that
they
have
spared
no
efforts
to
introduce
their
principles
into
the
lodges
and
to
spread
a
doctrine
subversive
of
all
settled
government
under
the
pretext
of
the
regeneration
of
social
morality
and
the
amelioration
of
the
lot
and
condition
of
men
by
means
of
laws
founded
on
principles
and
sentiments
unknown
hitherto
and
contained
only
in
the
heads
of
the
leaders
illuminism
he
declares
is
becoming
a
great
and
formidable
power
and
i
fear
in
my
conscience
that
kings
and
peoples
will
have
much
to
suffer
from
it
unless
foresight
and
prudence
break
its
frightful
mechanism
affreux
two
years
later
on
january
berckheim
writes
again
to
the
minister
of
police
monseigneur
they
write
to
me
from
heidelberg
that
a
great
number
of
initiates
into
the
mysteries
of
illuminism
are
to
be
found
there
these
gentlemen
wear
as
a
sign
of
recognition
a
gold
ring
on
the
third
finger
of
the
left
hand
on
the
back
of
this
ring
there
is
a
little
rose
in
the
middle
of
this
rose
is
an
almost
imperceptible
dint
by
pressing
this
with
the
point
of
a
pin
one
touches
a
spring
by
this
means
the
two
gold
circles
are
detached
on
the
inside
of
the
first
of
these
circles
is
the
device
be
german
as
you
ought
to
be
on
the
inside
of
the
second
of
these
circles
are
engraved
the
words
pro
patria
subversive
as
the
ideas
of
the
illuminati
might
be
they
were
therefore
not
subversive
of
german
patriotism
we
shall
find
this
apparent
paradox
running
all
through
the
illuminist
movement
to
the
present
day
in
berckheim
drew
up
his
great
report
on
the
secret
societies
of
germany
which
is
of
so
much
importance
in
throwing
a
light
on
the
workings
of
the
modern
revolutionary
movement
that
extracts
must
be
given
here
at
length
his
testimony
gains
greater
weight
from
the
vagueness
he
displays
on
the
origins
of
illuminism
and
the
role
it
had
played
before
the
french
revolution
it
is
evident
therefore
that
he
had
not
taken
his
ideas
from
robison
or
barruel
to
whom
he
never
once
refers
but
from
information
gleaned
on
the
spot
in
germany
the
opening
paragraphs
finally
refute
the
fallacy
concerning
the
extinction
of
the
sect
in
the
oldest
and
most
dangerous
association
is
that
which
is
generally
known
under
the
denomination
of
the
and
of
which
the
foundation
goes
back
towards
the
middle
of
the
last
century
bavaria
was
its
cradle
it
is
said
that
it
had
for
founders
several
chiefs
of
the
order
of
the
jesuits
but
this
opinion
advanced
perhaps
at
random
is
founded
only
on
uncertain
premises
in
any
case
in
a
short
time
it
made
rapid
progress
and
the
bavarian
government
recognized
the
necessity
of
employing
methods
of
repression
against
it
and
even
of
driving
away
several
of
the
principal
sectaries
but
it
could
not
eradicate
the
germ
of
the
evil
the
who
remained
in
bavaria
obliged
to
wrap
themselves
in
darkness
so
as
to
escape
the
eye
of
authority
became
only
the
more
formidable
the
rigorous
measures
of
which
they
were
the
object
adorned
by
the
title
of
persecution
gained
them
new
proselytes
whilst
the
banished
members
went
to
carry
the
principles
of
the
association
into
other
states
thus
in
a
few
years
illuminism
multiplied
its
hotbeds
all
through
the
south
of
germany
and
as
a
consequence
in
saxony
in
prussia
in
sweden
and
even
in
russia
the
reveries
of
the
pietists
have
long
been
confounded
with
those
of
the
illuminés
this
error
may
arise
from
the
denomination
of
the
sect
which
at
first
suggests
the
idea
of
a
purely
religious
fanaticism
and
of
mystic
forms
which
it
was
obliged
to
take
at
its
birth
in
order
to
conceal
its
principles
and
projects
but
the
association
always
had
a
political
tendency
if
it
still
retains
some
mystic
traits
it
is
in
order
to
support
itself
at
need
by
the
power
of
religious
fanaticism
and
we
shall
see
in
what
follows
how
well
it
knows
to
turn
this
to
account
the
doctrine
of
illuminism
is
subversive
of
every
kind
of
monarchy
unlimited
liberty
absolute
levelling
down
such
is
the
fundamental
dogma
of
the
sect
to
break
the
ties
that
bind
the
sovereign
to
the
citizen
of
a
state
that
is
the
object
of
all
its
efforts
no
doubt
some
of
the
principal
chiefs
amongst
whom
are
numbered
men
distinguished
for
their
fortune
their
birth
and
the
dignities
with
which
they
are
invested
are
not
the
dupes
of
these
demagogic
dreams
they
hope
to
find
in
the
popular
emotions
they
stir
up
the
means
of
seizing
the
reigns
of
power
or
at
any
rate
of
increasing
their
wealth
and
their
credit
but
the
crowd
of
adepts
believe
in
it
religiously
and
in
order
to
reach
the
goal
shown
to
them
they
maintain
incessantly
a
hostile
attitude
towards
sovereigns
thus
the
hailed
with
enthusiasm
the
ideas
that
prevailed
in
france
from
to
perhaps
they
were
not
foreign
to
the
intrigues
which
prepared
the
explosions
of
and
the
following
years
but
if
they
did
not
take
an
active
part
in
these
manoeuvres
it
is
at
least
beyond
doubt
that
they
openly
applauded
the
systems
which
resulted
from
them
that
the
republican
armies
when
they
penetrated
into
germany
found
in
these
sectarians
auxiliaries
the
more
dangerous
for
the
sovereigns
of
the
invaded
states
in
that
they
inspired
no
distrust
and
we
can
say
with
assurance
that
more
than
one
general
of
the
republic
owed
a
part
of
its
success
to
his
understanding
with
the
it
would
be
a
mistake
if
one
confounded
illuminism
with
freemasonry
these
two
associations
in
spite
of
the
points
of
resemblance
they
may
possess
in
the
mystery
with
which
they
surround
themselves
in
the
tests
that
precede
initiation
and
in
other
matters
of
form
are
absolutely
distinct
and
have
no
kind
of
connexion
with
each
other
the
lodges
of
the
scottish
rite
number
it
is
true
a
few
amongst
the
masons
of
the
higher
degrees
but
these
adepts
are
very
careful
not
to
be
known
as
such
to
their
brothers
in
masonry
or
to
manifest
ideas
that
would
betray
their
secret
berckheim
then
goes
on
to
describe
the
subtle
methods
by
which
the
illuminati
now
maintain
their
existence
learning
wisdom
from
the
events
of
their
organization
is
carried
on
invisibly
so
as
to
defy
the
eye
of
authority
it
was
thought
for
a
long
while
that
the
association
had
a
grand
mastership
that
is
to
say
a
centre
point
from
which
radiated
all
the
impulsions
given
to
this
great
body
and
this
primary
motive
power
was
sought
for
successively
in
all
the
capitals
of
the
north
in
paris
and
even
in
rome
this
error
gave
birth
to
another
opinion
no
less
fallacious
it
was
supposed
that
there
existed
in
the
principal
towns
lodges
where
initiations
were
made
and
which
received
directly
the
instructions
emanating
from
the
headquarters
of
the
society
if
such
had
been
the
organization
of
illuminism
it
would
not
so
long
have
escaped
the
investigations
of
which
it
was
the
object
these
meetings
necessarily
thronged
and
frequent
requiring
besides
like
masonic
lodges
appropriate
premises
would
have
aroused
the
attention
of
magistrates
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
to
introduce
false
brothers
who
directed
and
protected
by
authority
would
soon
have
penetrated
the
secrets
of
the
sect
this
is
what
i
have
gathered
most
definitely
on
the
association
of
the
first
i
would
point
out
that
by
the
word
hotbeds
foyers
i
did
not
mean
to
designate
points
of
meeting
for
the
adepts
places
where
they
hold
assemblies
but
only
localities
where
the
association
counts
a
great
number
of
partisans
who
whilst
living
isolated
in
appearance
exchange
ideas
have
an
understanding
with
each
other
and
advance
together
towards
the
same
goal
the
association
had
it
is
true
assemblies
at
its
birth
where
receptions
initiations
took
place
but
the
dangers
which
resulted
from
these
made
them
feel
the
necessity
of
abandoning
them
it
was
settled
that
each
initiated
adept
should
have
the
right
without
the
help
of
anyone
else
to
initiate
all
those
who
after
the
usual
tests
seemed
to
him
worthy
the
catechism
of
the
sect
is
composed
of
a
very
small
number
of
articles
which
might
even
be
reduced
to
this
single
principle
to
arm
the
opinion
of
the
peoples
against
sovereigns
and
to
work
by
every
method
for
the
fall
of
monarchic
governments
in
order
to
found
in
their
place
systems
of
absolute
independence
everything
that
can
tend
towards
this
object
is
in
the
spirit
of
the
association
initiations
are
not
accompanied
as
in
masonry
by
phantasmagoric
trials
but
they
are
preceded
by
long
moral
tests
which
guarantee
in
the
safest
way
the
fidelity
of
the
catechumen
oaths
a
mixture
of
all
that
is
most
sacred
in
religion
threats
and
imprecations
against
traitors
nothing
that
can
stagger
the
imagination
is
spared
but
the
only
engagement
into
which
the
recipient
enters
is
to
propagate
the
principles
with
which
he
has
been
imbued
to
maintain
inviolable
secrecy
on
all
that
pertains
to
the
association
and
to
work
with
all
his
might
to
increase
the
number
of
proselytes
it
will
no
doubt
seem
astonishing
that
there
can
be
the
least
accord
in
the
association
and
that
men
bound
together
by
no
physical
tie
and
who
live
at
great
distances
from
each
other
can
communicate
their
ideas
to
each
other
make
plans
of
conduct
and
give
grounds
of
fear
to
governments
but
there
exists
an
invisible
chain
which
binds
together
all
the
scattered
members
of
the
association
here
are
a
few
links
all
the
adepts
living
in
the
same
town
usually
know
each
other
unless
the
population
of
the
town
or
the
number
of
the
adepts
is
too
considerable
in
this
last
case
they
are
divided
into
several
groups
who
are
all
in
touch
with
each
other
by
means
of
members
of
the
association
whom
personal
relations
bind
to
two
or
several
groups
at
a
time
these
groups
are
again
subdivided
into
so
many
private
coteries
which
the
difference
of
rank
of
fortune
of
character
tastes
may
necessitate
they
are
always
small
sometimes
composed
of
five
or
six
individuals
who
meet
frequently
under
various
pretexts
sometimes
at
the
house
of
one
member
sometimes
at
that
of
another
literature
art
amusements
of
all
kinds
are
the
apparent
object
of
these
meetings
and
it
is
nevertheless
in
these
confabulations
that
the
adepts
communicate
their
private
views
to
each
other
agree
on
methods
receive
the
directions
that
the
intermediaries
bring
them
and
communicate
their
own
ideas
to
these
same
intermediaries
who
then
go
on
to
propagate
them
in
other
coteries
it
will
be
understood
that
there
may
be
uniformity
in
the
march
of
all
these
separated
groups
and
that
one
day
may
suffice
to
communicate
the
same
impulse
to
all
the
quarters
of
a
large
town
these
are
the
methods
by
which
the
without
any
apparent
organization
without
settled
leaders
agree
together
from
the
banks
of
the
rhine
to
those
of
the
neva
from
the
baltic
to
the
dardanelles
and
advance
continually
towards
the
same
goal
without
leaving
any
trace
that
might
compromise
the
interests
of
the
association
or
even
bring
suspicion
on
any
of
its
members
the
most
active
police
would
fail
before
such
a
combination
as
the
principal
force
of
the
lies
in
the
power
of
opinions
they
have
set
themselves
out
from
the
beginning
to
make
proselytes
amongst
the
men
who
through
their
profession
exercise
a
direct
influence
on
minds
such
as
savants
and
above
all
professors
the
latter
in
their
chairs
the
former
in
their
writings
propagate
the
principles
of
the
sect
by
disguising
the
poison
that
they
circulate
under
a
thousand
different
forms
these
germs
often
imperceptible
to
the
eyes
of
the
vulgar
are
afterwards
developed
by
the
adepts
of
the
societies
they
frequent
and
the
most
obscure
wording
is
thus
brought
to
the
understanding
of
the
least
discerning
it
is
above
all
in
the
universities
that
illuminism
has
always
found
and
always
will
find
numerous
recruits
those
professors
who
belong
to
the
association
set
out
from
the
first
to
study
the
character
of
their
pupils
if
a
student
gives
evidence
of
a
vigorous
mind
an
ardent
imagination
the
sectaries
at
once
get
hold
of
him
they
sound
in
his
ears
the
words
despotism
tyranny
rights
of
the
people
etc
before
he
can
even
attach
any
meaning
to
these
words
as
he
advances
in
age
reading
chosen
for
him
conversations
skilfully
arranged
develop
the
germs
deposited
in
his
youthful
brain
soon
his
imagination
ferments
history
traditions
of
fabulous
times
all
are
made
use
of
to
carry
his
exaltation
to
the
highest
point
and
before
even
he
has
been
told
of
a
secret
association
to
contribute
to
the
fall
of
a
sovereign
appears
to
his
eyes
the
noblest
and
most
meritorious
act
at
last
when
he
has
been
completely
captivated
when
several
years
of
testing
guarantee
to
the
society
inviolable
secrecy
and
absolute
devotion
it
is
made
known
to
him
that
millions
of
individuals
distributed
in
all
the
states
of
europe
share
his
sentiments
and
his
hopes
that
a
secret
link
binds
firmly
all
the
scattered
members
of
this
immense
family
and
that
the
reforms
he
desires
so
ardently
must
sooner
or
later
come
about
this
propaganda
is
rendered
the
easier
by
the
existing
associations
of
students
who
meet
together
for
the
study
of
literature
for
fencing
gaming
or
even
mere
debauchery
the
illuminés
insinuate
themselves
into
all
these
circles
and
turn
them
into
for
the
propagation
of
their
principles
such
then
is
the
association
continual
mode
of
progression
from
its
origins
until
the
present
moment
it
is
by
conveying
from
childhood
the
germ
of
poison
into
the
highest
classes
of
society
in
feeding
the
minds
of
students
on
ideas
diametrically
opposed
to
that
order
of
things
under
which
they
have
to
live
in
breaking
the
ties
that
bind
them
to
sovereigns
that
illuminism
has
recruited
the
largest
number
of
adepts
called
by
the
state
to
which
they
were
born
to
be
the
mainstays
of
the
throne
and
of
a
system
which
would
ensure
them
honours
and
privileges
amongst
the
proselytes
of
this
last
class
there
are
some
no
doubt
whom
political
events
the
favour
of
the
prince
or
other
circumstances
detach
from
the
association
but
the
number
of
these
deserters
is
necessarily
very
limited
and
even
then
they
dare
not
speak
openly
against
their
old
associates
whether
because
they
are
in
dread
of
private
vengeances
or
whether
because
knowing
the
real
power
of
the
sect
they
want
to
keep
paths
of
reconciliation
open
to
themselves
often
indeed
they
are
so
fettered
by
the
pledges
they
have
personally
given
that
they
find
it
necessary
not
only
to
consider
the
interests
of
the
sect
but
to
serve
it
indirectly
although
their
new
circumstances
demand
the
contrary
berckheim
then
proceeds
to
show
that
those
writers
on
illuminism
were
mistaken
who
declared
that
political
assassinations
were
definitely
commanded
by
the
order
there
is
more
than
exaggeration
in
this
accusation
those
who
put
it
forward
more
zealous
in
striking
an
effect
than
in
seeking
the
truth
may
have
concluded
not
without
probability
that
men
who
surrounded
themselves
with
profound
mystery
who
propagated
a
doctrine
absolutely
subversive
of
any
kind
of
monarchy
dreamt
only
of
the
assassination
of
sovereigns
but
experience
has
shown
and
all
the
documents
derived
from
the
least
suspect
sources
confirm
this
that
the
count
a
great
deal
more
on
the
power
of
opinion
than
on
assassination
the
regicide
committed
on
gustavus
iii
is
perhaps
the
only
crime
of
this
kind
that
illuminism
has
dared
to
attempt
if
indeed
it
is
really
proved
that
this
crime
was
its
work
moreover
if
assassination
had
been
as
it
is
said
the
fundamental
point
in
its
doctrine
might
we
not
suppose
that
other
regicides
would
have
been
attempted
in
germany
during
the
course
of
the
french
revolution
especially
when
the
republican
armies
occupied
the
country
the
sect
would
be
much
less
formidable
if
this
were
its
doctrine
on
the
one
hand
because
it
would
inspire
in
most
of
the
a
feeling
of
horror
which
would
triumph
even
over
the
fear
of
vengeance
on
the
other
hand
because
plots
and
conspiracies
always
leave
some
traces
which
guide
the
authorities
to
the
footsteps
of
the
prime
instigators
and
besides
it
is
the
nature
of
things
that
out
of
twenty
plots
directed
against
sovereigns
nineteen
come
to
light
before
they
have
reached
the
point
of
maturity
necessary
to
their
execution
the
line
of
march
is
more
prudent
more
skilful
and
consequently
more
dangerous
instead
of
revolting
the
imagination
by
ideas
of
regicide
they
affect
the
most
generous
sentiments
declamations
on
the
unhappy
state
of
the
people
on
the
selfishness
of
courtiers
on
measures
of
administration
on
all
acts
of
authority
that
may
offer
a
pretext
to
declamations
as
a
contrast
to
the
seductive
pictures
of
the
felicity
that
awaits
the
nations
under
the
systems
they
wish
to
establish
such
is
their
manner
of
procedure
particularly
in
private
more
circumspect
in
their
writings
they
usually
disguise
the
poison
they
dare
not
proffer
openly
under
obscure
metaphysics
or
more
or
less
ingenious
allegories
often
indeed
texts
from
holy
writ
serve
as
an
envelope
and
vehicle
for
these
baneful
insinuations
by
this
continuous
and
insidious
form
of
propaganda
the
imagination
of
the
adepts
is
so
worked
on
that
if
a
crisis
arises
they
are
ready
to
carry
out
the
most
daring
projects
another
association
closely
resembling
the
berckheim
reports
is
known
as
the
whose
system
is
founded
on
the
doctrine
of
perfectibility
these
kindred
sects
agree
in
seeing
in
the
words
of
holy
scripture
the
pledge
of
universal
regeneration
of
an
absolute
levelling
down
and
it
is
in
this
spirit
that
the
sectarians
interpret
the
sacred
books
berckheim
further
confirms
the
assertion
i
made
in
contested
as
usual
by
a
reviewer
without
a
shred
of
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
the
tugendbund
derived
from
the
illuminati
the
league
of
virtue
he
writes
was
directed
by
the
secondary
chiefs
of
the
in
the
friends
of
virtue
were
so
identified
with
the
in
the
north
of
germany
that
no
line
of
demarcation
was
seen
between
them
but
it
is
time
to
turn
to
the
testimony
of
another
witness
on
the
activities
of
the
secret
societies
which
is
likewise
to
be
found
at
the
archives
nationales
this
consists
of
a
document
transmitted
by
the
court
of
vienna
to
the
government
of
france
after
the
restoration
and
contains
the
interrogatory
of
a
certain
witt
doehring
a
nephew
of
the
baron
who
after
taking
part
in
secret
society
intrigues
was
summoned
before
the
judge
abel
at
bayreuth
in
february
amongst
secret
associations
recently
existing
in
germany
the
witness
asserted
were
the
independents
and
the
absolutes
the
latter
adored
in
robespierre
their
most
perfect
ideal
so
that
the
crimes
committed
during
the
french
revolution
by
this
monster
and
the
montagnards
of
the
convention
were
in
their
eyes
in
accordance
with
their
moral
system
heroic
actions
ennobled
and
sanctified
by
their
aim
the
same
document
goes
on
to
explain
why
so
many
combustible
elements
had
failed
to
produce
an
explosion
in
germany
the
thing
that
seemed
the
great
obstacle
to
the
plans
of
the
independents
was
what
they
called
the
servile
character
and
the
fidelity
of
the
german
people
that
is
to
say
that
attachment
innate
and
firmly
impressed
on
their
minds
without
even
the
aid
of
reason
which
that
excellent
people
everywhere
bears
towards
its
princes
a
traveller
in
germany
during
the
year
admirably
summed
up
the
matter
in
these
words
the
germans
are
in
this
respect
of
democracy
the
most
curious
people
in
the
world
the
cold
and
sober
temperament
of
the
germans
and
their
tranquil
imagination
enable
them
to
combine
the
most
daring
opinions
with
the
most
servile
conduct
that
will
explain
to
you
why
so
much
combustible
material
accumulating
for
so
many
years
beneath
the
political
edifice
of
germany
has
not
yet
damaged
it
most
of
the
princes
accustomed
to
see
their
men
of
letters
so
constantly
free
in
their
writings
and
so
constantly
slavish
in
their
hearts
have
not
thought
it
necessary
to
use
severity
against
this
sheeplike
herd
of
modern
gracchi
and
brutuses
some
of
them
the
princes
have
even
without
difficulty
adopted
part
of
their
opinions
and
illuminism
having
doubtless
been
presented
to
them
as
perfection
the
complement
of
philosophy
they
were
easily
persuaded
to
be
initiated
into
it
but
great
care
was
taken
not
to
let
them
know
more
than
the
interests
of
the
sect
demanded
it
was
thus
that
illuminism
unable
to
provoke
a
blaze
in
the
home
of
its
birth
spread
as
before
the
french
revolution
to
a
more
inflammable
latin
race
this
time
the
italians
six
years
after
his
interrogatory
at
beyreuth
witt
doehring
published
his
book
on
the
secret
societies
of
france
and
italy
in
which
he
now
realized
he
had
played
the
part
of
dupe
and
incidentally
confirms
the
statement
i
have
previously
quoted
that
the
alta
vendita
was
a
further
development
of
the
illuminati
this
infamous
association
with
which
i
have
dealt
at
length
elsewhere
constituted
the
supreme
directory
of
the
carbonari
and
was
led
by
a
group
of
italian
noblemen
amongst
whom
a
prince
the
profoundest
of
initiates
was
charged
as
of
the
order
to
propagate
its
principles
throughout
the
north
of
europe
he
had
received
from
the
hands
of
kingge
knigge
the
ally
of
weishaupt
the
cahiers
of
the
last
three
degrees
but
these
were
of
course
unknown
to
the
great
majority
of
carbonari
who
entered
the
association
in
all
good
faith
witt
doehring
then
shows
how
faithfully
the
system
of
weishaupt
was
carried
out
by
the
alta
vendita
in
the
three
first
degrees
he
explains
it
is
still
a
question
of
the
morality
of
christianity
and
even
of
the
church
for
which
those
who
wish
to
be
received
must
promise
to
sacrifice
themselves
the
initiates
imagine
according
to
this
formula
that
the
object
of
the
association
is
something
high
and
noble
that
it
is
the
order
of
those
who
desire
a
purer
morality
and
a
stronger
piety
the
independence
and
the
unity
of
their
country
one
can
not
therefore
judge
the
carbonari
there
are
excellent
men
amongst
them
but
everything
changes
after
one
has
taken
the
three
degrees
already
in
the
fourth
in
that
of
the
one
promises
to
overthrow
all
monarchies
and
especially
the
kings
of
the
race
of
the
bourbons
but
it
is
only
in
the
seventh
and
last
degree
reached
by
few
that
revelations
go
further
at
last
the
veil
is
torn
completely
for
the
principi
summo
patriarcho
then
one
learns
that
the
aim
of
the
carbonari
is
just
the
same
as
that
of
the
this
degree
in
which
a
man
is
at
the
same
time
prince
and
bishop
coincides
with
the
homo
rex
of
the
latter
the
initiate
vows
the
ruin
of
all
religion
and
of
all
positive
government
whether
despotic
or
democratic
murder
poison
perjury
are
all
at
their
disposal
who
does
not
remember
that
on
the
suppression
of
the
was
found
amongst
other
poisons
a
ad
abortum
the
laughs
at
the
zeal
of
the
mass
of
carbonari
who
have
sacrificed
themselves
for
the
liberty
and
independence
of
italy
neither
one
nor
the
other
being
for
him
a
goal
but
a
method
witt
doehring
who
had
himself
reached
the
degree
of
thereupon
declares
that
having
taken
his
vows
under
a
misapprehension
he
holds
himself
to
be
released
from
his
obligations
and
conceives
it
his
duty
to
warn
society
the
fears
that
assail
governments
are
only
too
well
founded
the
soil
of
europe
is
volcanic
it
is
unnecessary
to
go
over
the
ground
already
traversed
in
by
relating
the
history
of
the
successive
eruptions
which
proved
the
truth
of
witt
doehring
warning
the
point
to
emphasize
again
is
that
every
one
of
these
eruptions
can
be
traced
to
the
work
of
the
secret
societies
and
that
as
in
the
eighteenth
century
most
of
the
prominent
revolutionaries
were
known
to
be
connected
with
some
secret
association
according
to
the
plan
laid
down
by
weishaupt
freemasonry
was
habitually
adopted
as
a
cover
thus
louis
de
la
numbering
bazard
and
buchez
amongst
blanc
himself
a
freemason
speaks
of
a
lodge
named
the
its
founders
in
which
the
solemn
puerilities
of
the
grand
orient
only
served
to
mask
political
action
bakunin
companion
of
the
freemason
proudhon
the
father
of
anarchy
makes
use
of
precisely
the
same
expression
freemasonry
he
explains
is
not
to
be
taken
seriously
but
may
serve
as
a
mask
and
as
a
means
of
preparing
something
quite
different
i
have
quoted
elsewhere
the
statement
of
the
socialist
malon
that
bakunin
was
a
disciple
of
weishaupt
and
that
of
the
anarchist
kropotkine
that
between
bakunin
secret
society
the
sociale
and
the
secret
societies
of
there
was
a
direct
affiliation
i
have
quoted
the
assertion
of
malon
that
communism
was
handed
down
in
the
dark
through
the
secret
societies
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
have
quoted
also
the
congratulations
addressed
by
lamartine
and
the
freemason
crémieux
to
the
freemasons
of
france
in
on
their
share
in
this
revolution
as
in
that
of
i
have
shown
that
the
organization
of
this
later
outbreak
by
the
secret
societies
is
not
a
matter
of
surmise
but
a
fact
admitted
by
all
historians
and
by
the
members
of
the
secret
societies
themselves
so
too
in
the
events
of
the
commune
and
in
the
founding
of
the
first
internationale
the
role
of
freemasonry
and
the
secret
societies
is
no
less
apparent
the
freemasons
of
france
have
indeed
always
boasted
of
their
share
in
political
and
social
upheavals
thus
in
malapert
orator
of
the
supreme
council
of
the
ancient
and
accepted
scottish
rite
went
so
far
as
to
say
in
the
eighteenth
century
freemasonry
was
so
widespread
throughout
the
world
that
one
can
say
that
since
that
epoch
nothing
has
been
done
without
its
consent
the
secret
history
of
europe
during
the
last
two
hundred
years
yet
remains
to
be
written
until
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
des
many
events
that
have
taken
place
during
this
period
must
remain
for
ever
incomprehensible
but
it
is
time
to
leave
the
past
and
consider
the
secret
forces
at
work
in
the
world
part
ii
modern
freemasonry
in
the
foregoing
portion
of
this
book
we
have
followed
the
history
of
freemasonry
in
the
past
and
the
various
interpretations
that
have
been
placed
on
its
rites
and
ceremonies
the
question
now
arises
what
is
the
role
of
freemasonry
the
fundamental
error
of
most
writers
on
this
question
whether
masonic
or
is
to
represent
all
freemasons
as
holding
a
common
belief
and
animated
by
a
common
purpose
thus
on
one
hand
the
panegyrics
by
freemasons
on
their
order
as
a
whole
and
on
the
other
hand
the
sweeping
condemnations
of
the
order
by
the
catholic
church
are
equally
at
fault
the
truth
is
that
freemasonry
in
a
generic
sense
is
simply
a
system
of
binding
men
together
for
any
given
purpose
since
it
is
obvious
that
allegories
and
symbols
like
the
and
of
algebra
can
be
interpreted
in
a
hundred
different
manners
two
pillars
may
be
said
to
represent
strength
and
stability
or
man
and
woman
or
light
and
darkness
or
any
other
two
things
we
please
a
triangle
may
signify
the
trinity
or
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
or
any
other
triad
to
say
that
any
of
these
symbols
have
an
absolute
meaning
is
absurd
the
allegories
of
freemasonry
are
equally
capable
of
various
interpretations
the
building
of
the
temple
of
solomon
may
signify
the
progress
of
any
undertaking
and
hiram
the
victim
of
its
opponents
so
also
with
regard
to
the
secret
tradition
of
freemasonry
concerning
a
loss
which
has
befallen
humanity
and
its
ultimate
recovery
any
body
of
people
working
for
an
object
may
be
said
to
have
experienced
a
loss
and
to
aim
at
its
recovery
in
the
same
way
the
whole
organization
of
freemasonry
the
plan
of
admitting
candidates
to
successive
degrees
of
initiation
of
binding
them
to
secrecy
by
fearful
oaths
is
one
that
can
be
employed
for
any
purpose
social
political
philanthropic
or
religious
for
promoting
that
which
is
good
or
for
disseminating
that
which
is
evil
it
may
be
used
to
defend
a
throne
or
to
overthrow
it
to
protect
religion
or
to
destroy
it
to
maintain
law
and
order
or
to
create
anarchy
now
there
was
as
we
have
seen
from
the
beginning
besides
the
written
charges
an
in
masonry
after
the
manner
of
the
cabala
on
which
the
guidance
of
the
society
depended
the
true
character
of
any
form
of
freemasonry
is
thus
not
to
be
judged
only
by
its
printed
ritual
but
by
the
oral
instruction
of
the
initiates
and
the
interpretations
placed
on
the
symbols
and
ritual
naturally
these
interpretations
vary
in
different
countries
and
at
different
periods
freemasonry
is
described
in
its
ritual
as
a
peculiar
system
of
morality
veiled
in
allegory
and
illustrated
by
symbols
but
what
code
of
morality
in
studying
the
history
of
the
order
we
shall
find
that
the
same
code
was
by
no
means
common
to
all
masonic
bodies
nor
is
it
some
maintain
a
very
high
standard
of
morals
others
appear
to
possess
no
standard
at
all
waite
observes
that
the
two
doctrines
of
the
unity
of
god
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
constitute
philosophy
of
freemasonry
but
these
doctrines
are
by
no
means
essential
to
the
existence
of
freemasonry
the
grand
orient
has
renounced
both
but
it
still
ranks
as
freemasonry
paul
nourrisson
is
therefore
perfectly
right
in
saying
there
are
as
many
masonries
as
countries
there
is
no
such
thing
as
universal
masonry
broadly
however
modern
freemasonry
may
be
divided
into
two
kinds
the
variety
worked
in
the
british
empire
in
america
holland
sweden
denmark
and
grand
orient
masonry
which
prevails
in
catholic
countries
and
of
which
the
most
important
centre
is
the
grand
orient
of
paris
continental
masonry
the
fact
that
masonry
in
protestant
countries
is
neither
revolutionary
nor
is
frequently
used
by
catholic
writers
to
show
that
protestantism
identifies
itself
with
the
aims
of
masonry
and
by
freemasons
to
prove
that
the
tyranny
of
the
church
of
rome
has
driven
masonry
into
an
attitude
hostile
to
church
and
state
the
point
overlooked
in
both
these
contentions
is
the
essential
difference
in
the
character
of
the
two
kinds
of
masonry
if
the
grand
orient
had
adhered
to
the
fundamental
principle
of
british
masonry
not
to
concern
itself
with
religion
or
politics
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
have
come
into
conflict
with
the
church
but
its
duplicity
on
this
point
is
apparent
thus
in
one
of
its
earlier
manuals
it
declares
like
british
masonry
that
it
never
interferes
with
questions
of
government
or
of
civil
and
religious
legislation
and
that
whilst
making
its
members
participate
in
the
perfecting
of
all
sciences
it
positively
excepts
in
the
lodges
two
of
the
most
beautiful
and
because
these
two
sciences
divide
men
and
nations
which
masonry
constantly
tends
to
unite
but
on
a
further
page
of
the
same
manual
from
which
this
quotation
is
taken
we
find
it
stated
that
masonry
is
simply
the
political
application
of
christianity
indeed
during
the
last
fifty
years
the
grand
orient
has
thrown
off
the
mask
and
openly
declared
itself
to
be
political
in
its
aims
in
october
the
venerable
blanc
said
in
a
discourse
which
was
printed
for
the
lodges
you
recognise
with
me
my
brothers
the
necessity
for
freemasonry
to
become
a
vast
and
powerful
political
and
social
society
having
a
decisive
influence
on
the
resolutions
of
the
republican
government
and
in
the
freemason
fernand
maurice
declared
that
nothing
should
happen
in
france
without
the
hidden
action
of
freemasonry
and
if
the
masons
choose
to
organize
in
ten
years
time
no
one
in
france
will
be
able
to
move
outside
us
ne
bougera
plus
en
france
en
dehors
de
this
is
the
despotic
power
which
the
grand
orient
has
established
in
opposition
to
both
church
and
government
moreover
grand
orient
masonry
is
not
only
political
but
subversive
in
its
political
aims
instead
of
the
peaceful
trilogy
of
british
masonry
brotherly
love
relief
and
truth
it
has
throughout
adhered
to
the
formula
which
originated
in
the
masonic
lodges
of
france
and
became
the
of
the
revolution
liberty
equality
fraternity
it
is
the
law
of
equality
says
ragon
that
has
always
endeared
masonry
to
the
french
and
as
long
as
equality
really
exists
only
in
the
lodges
masonry
will
be
preserved
in
france
the
aim
of
grand
orient
masonry
is
thus
to
bring
about
universal
equality
as
formulated
by
robespierre
and
babeuf
in
the
matter
of
liberty
we
read
further
that
as
men
are
all
by
nature
free
the
old
fallacy
of
rousseau
and
of
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
therefore
no
one
is
necessarily
subjected
to
another
nor
has
the
right
to
rule
him
the
revolutionary
expresses
the
same
idea
in
the
phrase
that
no
man
should
have
a
master
finally
by
fraternity
grand
orient
masonry
denotes
the
abolition
of
all
national
feeling
it
is
to
masonry
ragon
says
again
that
we
owe
the
affiliation
of
all
classes
of
society
it
alone
could
bring
about
this
fusion
which
from
its
midst
has
passed
into
the
life
of
the
peoples
it
alone
could
promulgate
that
humanitarian
law
of
which
the
rising
activity
tending
to
a
great
social
uniformity
leads
to
the
fusion
of
races
of
different
classes
of
morals
codes
customs
languages
fashions
money
and
measures
its
virtuous
propaganda
will
become
the
humanitarian
law
of
all
consciences
the
policy
of
the
grand
orient
is
thus
avowedly
international
socialism
indeed
in
a
further
passage
ragon
plainly
indicates
this
fact
every
generous
reform
every
social
benefit
derives
from
it
and
if
these
survive
it
is
because
masonry
lends
them
its
support
this
phenomenon
is
due
only
to
the
power
of
its
organization
the
past
belongs
to
it
and
the
future
can
not
escape
from
it
by
its
immense
lever
of
association
it
alone
is
able
to
realize
by
a
productive
communion
that
great
and
beautiful
social
unity
conceived
by
jaurez
owen
fourier
if
masons
wish
it
the
generous
conceptions
of
these
philanthropic
thinkers
will
cease
to
be
vain
utopias
who
are
the
philanthropic
thinkers
enumerated
here
but
the
men
derisively
described
by
karl
marx
as
the
utopian
socialists
of
the
nineteenth
century
utopian
socialism
is
thus
simply
the
open
and
visible
expression
of
grand
orient
freemasonry
moreover
these
utopian
socialists
were
almost
without
exception
freemasons
or
members
of
other
secret
societies
the
freemason
clavel
confirms
the
foregoing
account
by
ragon
thus
like
ragon
he
quotes
the
principle
expressed
in
a
ritual
for
the
initiation
of
a
master
mason
it
is
expressly
forbidden
to
masons
to
discuss
amongst
themselves
either
in
the
lodge
or
outside
it
religious
and
political
matters
these
discussions
having
usually
the
effect
of
creating
discord
where
formerly
peace
union
and
fraternity
reigned
this
masonic
law
admits
of
no
exceptions
but
clavel
also
goes
on
to
say
to
efface
amongst
men
the
distinctions
of
colour
rank
creed
opinions
country
to
annihilate
fanaticism
and
the
scourge
of
war
in
a
word
to
make
of
the
whole
human
race
one
and
the
same
family
united
by
affection
by
devotion
by
work
and
knowledge
that
my
brother
is
the
great
work
which
freemasonry
has
undertaken
etc
up
to
a
point
many
a
british
freemason
reading
these
passages
will
declare
himself
completely
in
accord
with
the
sentiments
expressed
humanitarianism
the
obliteration
of
class
distinctions
fraternization
between
men
of
all
races
conditions
and
religious
creeds
enter
of
course
largely
into
the
spirit
of
british
masonry
but
form
simply
the
basis
on
which
masons
meet
together
in
the
lodges
and
not
a
political
system
to
be
imposed
on
the
world
in
general
british
masonry
thus
makes
no
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
existing
social
system
or
form
of
government
the
essence
of
its
teaching
is
that
each
member
of
the
fraternity
should
seek
to
reform
himself
and
not
society
in
a
word
individual
regeneration
takes
the
place
of
the
social
reorganization
advocated
by
the
grand
orient
under
the
influence
of
illuminism
the
formula
of
the
united
states
of
europe
and
of
the
universal
republic
first
proclaimed
by
the
illuminatus
anacharsis
clootz
has
long
been
the
slogan
of
the
french
lodges
in
the
matter
of
religion
grand
orient
masonry
has
entirely
departed
from
the
principle
laid
down
by
the
british
lodges
if
the
catholic
church
has
shown
itself
hostile
to
masonry
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
catholic
countries
masonry
has
shown
itself
militantly
freemasonry
one
of
its
modern
orators
declared
is
the
the
the
church
of
heresy
contre
eglise
le
contre
catholicisme
de
the
of
the
grand
orient
in
officially
declared
we
freemasons
must
pursue
the
definite
demolition
of
catholicism
but
the
grand
orient
goes
further
than
this
and
attacks
all
forms
of
religion
thus
as
has
been
said
those
ancient
landmarks
of
british
masonry
belief
in
the
great
architect
of
the
universe
and
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
had
never
formed
an
integral
part
of
its
system
and
it
was
only
in
that
for
the
first
time
it
was
distinctly
formulated
that
the
basis
of
freemasonry
is
a
belief
in
god
and
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
the
solidarity
of
humanity
but
in
september
the
first
part
of
this
formula
was
deleted
all
allusions
to
the
great
architect
were
omitted
and
the
statute
now
reads
its
basis
is
absolute
liberty
of
conscience
and
the
solidarity
of
humanity
british
freemasonry
which
does
not
admit
liberty
of
conscience
in
the
sense
of
atheism
but
demands
that
every
mason
should
profess
belief
in
some
form
of
religion
and
which
insists
that
the
volume
of
the
sacred
law
in
england
the
bible
in
mohammedan
countries
the
koran
and
so
on
should
be
placed
on
the
table
in
its
lodges
thereupon
broke
off
all
relations
with
the
grand
orient
in
march
the
following
resolution
was
passed
unanimously
that
the
grand
lodge
whilst
always
anxious
to
receive
in
the
most
fraternal
spirit
the
brethren
of
any
foreign
grand
lodge
whose
proceedings
are
conducted
according
to
the
ancient
landmarks
of
the
order
of
which
a
belief
in
is
the
first
and
most
important
can
not
recognize
as
true
and
genuine
brethren
any
who
have
been
initiated
in
lodges
which
either
deny
or
ignore
that
belief
the
grand
orient
says
copin
albancelli
not
content
with
renouncing
the
great
architect
whose
glory
it
had
celebrated
on
every
possible
occasion
and
whose
praises
had
been
incessantly
sung
in
its
lodges
demanded
of
its
initiates
that
they
should
declare
themselves
to
be
absolutely
convinced
that
the
great
architect
was
nothing
but
a
myth
more
than
this
violent
tirades
have
been
permitted
and
even
applauded
in
the
lodges
thus
in
the
freemason
delpech
in
his
discourse
at
a
masonic
banquet
uttered
these
words
the
triumph
of
the
galilean
has
lasted
twenty
centuries
he
is
dying
in
his
turn
the
mysterious
voice
which
once
on
the
mountains
of
epirus
announced
the
death
of
pan
announces
the
death
of
the
deceiver
god
who
had
promised
an
era
of
justice
and
peace
to
those
who
should
believe
in
him
the
illusion
has
lasted
very
long
the
lying
god
in
his
turn
disappears
he
goes
to
rejoin
in
the
dust
of
ages
the
other
divinities
of
india
egypt
greece
and
rome
who
saw
so
many
deluded
creatures
throw
themselves
at
the
food
of
their
altars
freemasons
we
are
pleased
to
state
that
we
are
not
unconcerned
with
this
ruin
of
false
prophets
the
roman
church
founded
on
the
galilean
myth
began
to
decline
rapidly
on
the
day
when
the
masonic
association
was
constituted
from
the
political
point
of
view
freemasons
have
often
varied
but
in
all
times
freemasonry
has
stood
firm
on
this
principle
war
on
all
superstitions
war
on
all
fanaticism
how
is
it
possible
to
reconcile
this
attitude
towards
religion
in
general
and
christianity
in
particular
with
the
fact
that
the
grand
orient
still
works
the
degree
this
degree
which
as
we
have
seen
was
first
devised
whether
in
scotland
or
in
france
to
give
a
christian
meaning
to
masonry
was
only
incorporated
into
british
freemasonry
in
and
in
our
country
has
retained
its
original
character
its
ritual
centring
around
a
lost
word
signifies
that
the
old
testament
dispensation
has
come
to
an
end
with
the
crucifixion
and
is
so
strongly
christian
that
no
jew
mohammedan
or
other
can
be
admitted
to
it
moreover
since
this
degree
known
as
the
eighteenth
degree
forms
in
reality
the
first
degree
of
the
ancient
and
accepted
rite
as
worked
in
this
country
are
excluded
from
the
whole
of
this
rite
and
can
only
take
the
degrees
of
royal
arch
mark
mason
royal
ark
mariner
and
finally
royal
select
and
master
consequently
the
masons
of
the
degree
who
compose
the
supreme
council
which
directs
the
ancient
and
accepted
rite
are
necessarily
professing
christians
exactly
the
opposite
is
the
case
in
france
the
worked
by
professing
atheists
and
jews
can
only
be
parody
of
christian
mysteries
now
it
is
essential
to
realize
that
in
france
the
camp
is
divided
into
two
parties
whilst
the
majority
of
catholic
writers
regard
freemasonry
itself
as
the
source
of
all
evil
the
synagogue
of
satan
more
impartial
investigators
have
pronounced
the
opinion
that
it
is
not
freemasonry
even
of
the
grand
orient
variety
but
something
concealed
behind
freemasonry
which
constitutes
the
principal
danger
this
view
is
expressed
by
copin
albancelli
whose
book
pouvoir
occulte
contre
la
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
an
understanding
of
the
masonic
danger
for
here
there
can
be
no
question
of
catholic
prejudice
or
of
imaginary
accusations
made
by
a
stranger
to
masonry
copin
albancelli
entered
the
grand
orient
as
an
agnostic
and
has
never
returned
to
the
bosom
of
the
church
yet
as
a
frenchman
a
patriot
and
a
believer
in
law
morality
and
christian
ethics
he
found
himself
obliged
after
six
years
experience
in
the
lodges
and
after
attaining
the
degree
of
to
leave
freemasonry
and
further
to
denounce
it
from
what
he
himself
heard
and
observed
copin
albancelli
declares
the
grand
orient
to
be
subversive
of
all
morality
and
religious
belief
and
an
immense
danger
to
france
but
further
than
this
copin
albancelli
declares
the
grand
orient
to
be
a
system
of
deception
by
which
members
are
enlisted
in
a
cause
unknown
to
themselves
even
the
initiates
of
the
upper
degrees
are
not
all
aware
of
the
real
aim
of
the
order
or
of
the
power
behind
it
copin
albancelli
thus
arrives
at
the
conclusion
that
there
are
three
freemasonries
one
above
the
other
i
blue
masonry
the
three
craft
degrees
in
which
none
of
the
real
secrets
are
revealed
to
the
members
and
which
serves
merely
as
a
for
selecting
likely
subjects
the
upper
degrees
in
which
most
of
the
members
whilst
imagining
themselves
to
have
been
initiated
into
the
whole
secret
of
the
order
and
bursting
with
importance
over
their
imaginary
rôle
of
leaders
are
only
admitted
to
a
partial
knowledge
of
the
goal
to
which
they
are
tending
and
the
inner
circle
the
true
masters
those
who
conceal
themselves
behind
masonry
admission
to
this
inner
circle
may
be
moreover
not
a
matter
of
degrees
whilst
in
the
lower
masonries
the
adepts
are
obliged
to
pass
through
all
the
degrees
of
the
established
hierarchy
the
upper
and
invisible
freemasonry
is
certainly
recruited
not
only
amongst
the
degrees
but
in
all
the
groups
of
masonry
and
perhaps
even
in
certain
exceptional
cases
outside
these
this
inner
and
invisible
freemasonry
is
to
a
large
extent
the
most
illuminating
passage
in
the
whole
of
copin
albancelli
book
is
where
he
describes
an
experience
that
befell
him
after
he
had
taken
the
degree
of
it
was
then
that
one
of
his
superiors
took
him
aside
and
addressed
him
in
the
following
terms
you
realize
the
power
which
freemasonry
has
at
its
disposal
we
can
say
that
we
hold
france
it
is
not
because
of
our
numbers
since
there
are
only
freemasons
in
this
country
this
was
in
nor
is
it
because
we
are
the
brains
for
you
have
been
able
to
judge
of
the
intellectual
mediocrity
of
the
greater
number
of
these
freemasons
we
hold
france
because
we
are
organized
and
the
only
people
who
are
organized
but
above
all
we
hold
france
because
we
have
an
aim
this
aim
is
unknown
as
it
is
unknown
no
obstacle
can
be
put
in
its
way
and
finally
as
no
obstacle
is
put
up
the
way
is
wide
open
before
us
this
is
logical
is
it
not
absolutely
good
but
what
would
you
say
of
an
association
which
instead
of
consisting
of
nonentities
as
in
freemasonry
were
composed
of
say
only
a
thousand
individuals
but
a
thousand
individuals
recruited
in
the
manner
that
i
will
tell
you
and
the
freemason
went
on
to
explain
the
way
in
which
such
individuals
were
selected
the
months
and
years
of
observation
of
supervision
to
which
they
were
subjected
so
as
to
form
a
body
of
picked
men
inside
freemasonry
capable
of
directing
its
operations
you
can
imagine
the
power
at
the
command
of
such
an
association
an
association
thus
selected
would
do
anything
it
chose
it
could
possess
the
world
if
it
pleased
thereupon
the
higher
adept
after
asking
for
a
further
promise
of
secrecy
declared
well
in
exchange
for
this
promise
brother
copin
i
am
authorized
to
let
you
know
that
this
association
exists
and
that
further
i
am
authorized
to
introduce
you
into
it
it
was
then
that
monsieur
copin
albancelli
understood
that
the
point
to
which
the
conversation
was
leading
up
was
not
as
he
had
at
first
supposed
an
invitation
to
take
the
next
step
in
freemasonry
the
thirtieth
degree
of
knight
kadosch
but
to
enter
through
a
into
an
association
concealed
within
freemasonry
and
for
which
the
visible
organization
of
the
latter
served
merely
as
a
cover
a
very
curious
resemblance
will
here
be
noticed
between
the
method
of
sounding
copin
albancelli
and
that
of
the
illuminatus
cato
in
the
matter
of
savioli
described
in
a
passage
already
quoted
now
that
he
is
a
mason
i
have
taken
up
the
general
plan
of
our
and
as
this
pleased
him
i
said
that
such
a
thing
really
existed
whereat
he
gave
me
his
word
that
he
would
enter
it
copin
albancelli
however
did
not
give
his
word
that
he
would
enter
it
but
on
the
contrary
checked
further
revelations
by
declaring
that
he
would
leave
freemasonry
this
experience
had
afforded
him
a
glimpse
of
a
world
existing
behind
the
masonic
world
more
secret
than
it
unsuspected
by
it
as
by
the
outside
world
freemasonry
then
can
only
be
the
antechamber
of
the
real
secret
society
that
is
the
truth
there
exists
then
necessarily
a
permanent
directing
power
we
can
not
see
that
power
therefore
it
is
occult
for
some
time
copin
albancelli
concluded
this
power
to
be
the
jewish
power
and
elaborated
the
idea
in
a
further
work
but
the
war
has
led
him
to
develop
his
theories
in
yet
another
book
which
will
shortly
appear
that
the
lodges
of
the
grand
orient
are
largely
controlled
by
jews
is
however
certain
and
that
they
are
centres
of
political
propaganda
is
equally
undeniable
we
have
only
to
glance
at
the
following
extracts
some
of
which
are
reproduced
on
the
opposite
page
from
the
programme
of
debates
in
the
of
the
grand
orient
for
june
to
recognize
that
the
ideas
they
propagate
are
simply
those

it
will
be
seen
by
the
last
of
these
extracts
that
grand
orient
masonry
is
the
enemy
of
fascismo
which
saved
italy
in
her
hour
of
peril
indeed
the
italian
masons
passed
a
resolution
which
was
directly
opposed
to
fascist
views
especially
with
regard
to
the
religious
policy
of
mussolini
who
has
restored
the
crucifix
to
the
schools
and
religious
teaching
to
the
curriculum
the
fascist
di
declared
that
the
principles
announced
by
the
masons
in
this
resolution
were
those
which
threatened
to
submerge
the
state
and
nation
consequently
mussolini
declared
that
fascisti
must
either
leave
their
lodges
or
leave
fascismo
in
belgium
freemasonry
has
taken
the
same
political
and
course
in
the
directing
committee
of
the
belgian
grand
orient
declared
not
only
is
it
the
right
but
the
duty
of
the
lodges
to
supervise
the
actions
in
public
life
of
those
amongst
its
members
whom
it
has
placed
in
political
posts
the
right
to
demand
explanations
when
in
at
a
funeral
ceremony
in
honour
of
the
deceased
king
leopold
i
the
grand
orient
of
belgium
displayed
the
maxim
the
soul
which
has
emanated
from
god
is
immortal
the
freemasons
of
louvain
entered
a
violent
protest
on
the
ground
that
had
been
admitted
by
the
belgian
lodges
in
as
its
fundamental
principle
and
that
the
grand
orient
had
therefore
violated
the
convictions
of
its
members
in
spain
and
portugal
freemasonry
has
played
not
merely
a
subversive
but
an
actively
revolutionary
and
sanguinary
rôle
the
anarchist
ferrer
intimately
concerned
with
a
plot
to
murder
the
king
of
spain
was
at
the
same
moment
entrusted
with
negotiations
between
the
grand
orient
of
france
and
the
grand
lodge
of
catalonia
these
murderous
schemes
frustrated
in
spain
met
however
in
portugal
with
complete
success
the
portuguese
revolutions
from
to
were
organized
under
the
direction
of
freemasonry
and
the
secret
society
of
carbonarios
the
assassination
of
king
carlos
and
his
elder
son
had
been
prepared
by
the
same
secret
organizations
in
a
pamphlet
modelled
on
the
libels
published
against
marie
antoinette
was
directed
against
queen
amélie
and
her
husband
a
month
later
the
assassination
took
place
amongst
the
leaders
of
the
new
republic
was
magalhaes
lima
grand
master
of
the
grand
orient
of
portugal
the
authorship
of
these
disorders
was
in
fact
so
clearly
recognized
that
honest
freemasons
forsook
the
lodges
an
english
mason
unaware
of
the
true
character
of
portuguese
freemasonry
when
in
lisbon
in
august
made
himself
known
to
several
moderate
portuguese
masons
who
while
glad
to
welcome
him
as
a
brother
refused
to
take
him
to
a
lodge
declaring
that
they
had
severed
all
connection
with
masonry
since
it
had
passed
under
the
control
of
assassins
they
also
added
that
the
assassination
of
señor
paes
the
president
in
december
was
the
work
of
certain
portuguese
lodges
a
special
meeting
had
previously
been
held
in
paris
in
conjunction
with
the
grand
orient
of
france
at
which
it
had
been
decided
that
paes
was
to
be
removed
this
decision
reached
the
earliest
opportunity
of
putting
it
into
force
was
sought
with
fatal
results
the
assassin
was
imprisoned
in
the
penitentiary
but
liberated
by
the
revolution
of
and
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
recapture
him
the
murder
of
antonio
granjo
in
october
was
traced
to
the
same
agency
in
the
pocket
of
the
murdered
man
was
found
a
document
from
the
lodge
of
liberty
and
justice
warning
him
of
the
decision
taken
against
him
for
having
ordered
the
police
to
protect
the
british
tramway
company
the
present
portuguese
government
indeed
makes
no
secret
of
its
masonic
character
and
prints
the
square
and
compass
on
its
but
whilst
in
spain
and
portugal
freemasonry
manifested
itself
in
anarchist
outrages
in
the
east
of
europe
the
lodges
largely
under
the
control
of
jews
followed
the
line
of
marxian
socialism
after
the
fall
of
the
bela
kun
régime
in
hungary
a
raid
on
the
lodges
brought
to
light
documents
clearly
revealing
the
fact
that
the
ideas
of
socialism
had
been
disseminated
by
the
freemasons
thus
in
the
minutes
of
meetings
it
was
recorded
that
on
november
kallos
had
addressed
the
gyor
lodge
on
socialist
ideals
the
ideal
world
which
we
call
the
masonic
world
he
declared
will
be
also
a
socialist
world
and
the
religion
of
freemasonry
is
that
of
socialism
as
well
kallos
then
proceeded
to
acquaint
the
members
with
the
theories
of
marx
and
engels
showing
that
no
help
was
to
be
found
in
utopias
as
the
interests
of
the
proletarians
were
in
absolute
conflict
with
those
of
other
classes
and
these
differences
could
only
be
settled
by
international
class
warfare
nevertheless
with
that
fear
of
the
proletariat
which
has
always
characterized
the
democrats
of
revolutionary
freemasonry
kallos
declared
later
that
the
social
revolution
must
take
place
without
bloodshed
the
karolyi
régime
was
the
direct
outcome
of
these
illusions
and
as
in
all
revolutions
paved
the
way
for
the
more
violent
elements
still
further
east
in
europe
the
lodges
though
revolutionary
instead
of
following
the
international
socialist
line
of
hungarian
freemasonry
exhibited
a
political
and
nationalist
character
the
young
turk
movement
originated
in
the
masonic
lodges
of
salonica
under
the
direction
of
the
grand
orient
of
italy
which
later
contributed
to
the
success
of
mustapha
kemal
moreover
as
we
approach
the
near
east
cradle
of
the
masonic
system
we
find
the
semitic
influence
not
only
of
the
jews
but
of
other
semite
races
directing
the
lodges
in
turkey
in
egypt
in
syria
now
as
a
thousand
years
ago
the
same
secret
societies
which
inspired
the
templars
have
never
ceased
to
exist
and
in
this
mingling
of
the
east
and
west
it
is
possible
that
the
grand
orient
may
draw
reinforcement
from
those
sources
whence
it
drew
its
system
and
its
name
amongst
the
strange
survivals
of
early
eastern
sects
are
the
druses
of
lebanon
who
might
indeed
be
described
as
the
freemasons
of
the
east
their
outer
organization
closely
resembles
that
of
the
craft
degrees
in
western
masonry
yet
such
is
their
power
of
secrecy
that
few
if
any
europeans
have
ever
succeeded
in
discovering
the
secret
doctrines
that
their
tendency
is
largely
political
admits
of
little
doubt
in
fact
men
intimately
acquainted
with
the
near
east
have
declared
that
the
influence
they
exercise
over
the
politics
of
that
region
is
as
as
that
of
the
grand
orient
over
the
affairs
of
europe
and
that
they
form
the
of
all
political
ideas
and
changes
though
small
in
numbers
this
mysterious
society
is
composed
of
past
masters
in
the
game
of
intrigue
who
whilst
playing
apparently
a
minor
part
at
political
meetings
secret
or
otherwise
or
even
remaining
completely
silent
contrive
to
influence
decisions
with
startling
results
british
masonry
we
shall
now
consider
the
further
ways
in
which
british
masonry
differs
from
the
grand
orient
in
the
first
place
whilst
working
the
same
degrees
its
rituals
formulas
and
ceremonies
as
also
the
interpretation
it
places
on
words
and
symbols
are
different
in
many
essential
points
secondly
british
masonry
is
essentially
an
honest
institution
whereas
in
the
grand
orient
the
initiate
is
led
through
a
maze
of
ceremonies
towards
a
goal
unknown
to
him
which
he
may
discover
too
late
to
be
other
than
he
supposed
the
british
initiate
although
admitted
by
gradual
stages
to
the
mysteries
of
the
craft
knows
nevertheless
from
the
beginning
the
general
aim
of
the
order
thirdly
british
masonry
is
primarily
philanthropic
and
the
sums
it
devotes
to
charitable
purposes
are
immense
since
the
war
the
three
principal
masonic
charities
have
collected
annually
over
but
the
point
to
be
emphasized
here
is
that
british
masonry
is
strictly
not
merely
in
theory
but
in
practice
and
that
it
enforces
this
principle
on
every
occasion
thus
before
the
recent
general
election
the
report
of
the
board
of
general
purposes
drawn
up
by
grand
lodge
on
december
recalled
to
the
notice
of
the
craft
that
subjects
of
a
political
nature
are
strictly
excluded
from
discussion
in
masonic
meetings
this
being
in
accordance
with
masonic
tradition
it
follows
from
this
that
masonry
must
not
be
used
for
any
personal
or
party
purpose
in
connexion
with
an
election
it
further
emphasized
the
distinct
caution
that
any
attempt
to
bring
the
craft
into
the
electioneering
arena
would
be
treated
as
a
serious
masonic
offence
at
the
same
time
a
fresh
injunction
was
made
with
regard
to
the
grand
orient
of
france
as
recognition
was
withdrawn
from
that
body
by
the
united
grand
lodge
of
england
in
it
is
considered
necessary
to
warn
all
members
of
our
lodges
that
they
can
not
visit
any
lodge
under
the
obedience
of
a
jurisdiction
unrecognized
by
the
united
grand
lodge
of
england
and
further
that
under
rule
of
the
book
of
constitutions
they
can
not
admit
visitors
therefrom
for
the
reasons
given
at
the
beginning
of
this
section
british
masonry
stands
rigidly
aloof
from
all
attempts
to
create
an
international
system
of
masonry
the
idea
was
first
suggested
at
the
masonic
congress
of
paris
in
convened
to
celebrate
the
centenary
of
the
first
french
revolution
but
led
to
nothing
very
definite
until
the
congress
of
geneva
in
september
at
which
the
delegates
of
lodges
grand
lodges
grand
orients
and
supreme
councils
were
present
and
a
proposal
was
unanimously
adopted
tending
towards
the
creation
of
an
international
bureau
for
masonic
affairs
to
which
twenty
powers
mostly
europeans
gave
their
adherence
brother
desmons
of
the
grand
orient
of
france
in
an
speech
declared
it
to
have
been
always
the
dream
of
his
life
that
all
democracies
should
meet
and
understand
one
another
in
such
a
way
as
one
day
to
form
the
universal
republic
according
to
the
official
report
of
the
proceedings
the
representatives
of
belgium
holland
france
germany
england
spain
italy
and
switzerland
greeted
with
much
feeling
the
dawn
of
this
new
era
the
same
report
goes
on
to
observe
that
it
is
altogether
a
mistake
to
believe
that
freemasonry
does
not
attack
the
defects
of
such
and
such
a
state
and
that
consequently
it
remains
a
stranger
to
and
the
tendencies
of
the
times
and
again
freemasonry
has
imposed
upon
itself
a
task
a
mission
it
is
a
question
of
nothing
less
than
the
rebuilding
of
society
on
an
entirely
new
basis
which
shall
be
more
in
accordance
with
the
present
conditions
of
the
means
of
communication
of
situation
and
production
as
well
as
of
a
reform
of
right
of
a
complete
renewal
of
the
principle
of
existence
especially
of
the
principle
of
community
and
of
the
relations
of
men
among
one
another
the
report
here
quoted
is
however
inaccurate
in
one
important
particular
no
english
delegates
were
present
at
the
geneva
congress
or
on
any
other
occasion
of
the
kind
there
was
a
delegate
from
adelaide
who
spoke
a
good
deal
but
the
chairman
specifically
mentioned
england
as
taking
no
part
in
the
movement
later
on
in
a
report
of
the
board
of
general
purposes
to
grand
lodge
on
march
a
letter
from
lord
ampthill
pro
grand
master
appears
declining
an
invitation
from
the
swiss
grand
lodge
alpina
to
british
freemasons
to
attend
an
international
masonic
congress
in
geneva
and
quoting
the
following
letter
from
the
grand
secretary
as
an
earlier
precedent
for
this
refusal
i
am
directed
to
state
in
reply
to
the
invitation
to
attend
an
international
masonic
conference
in
switzerland
during
the
coming
autumn
that
the
united
grand
lodge
of
england
will
be
unable
to
send
representatives
on
the
occasion
it
never
participates
in
a
masonic
gathering
in
which
are
treated
as
an
open
question
what
it
has
always
held
to
be
ancient
and
essential
landmarks
of
the
craft
these
being
an
express
belief
in
the
great
architect
of
the
universe
and
an
obligatory
recognition
of
the
volume
of
the
sacred
law
its
refusal
to
remain
in
fraternal
association
with
such
sovereign
jurisdictions
as
have
repudiated
or
made
light
of
these
landmarks
has
long
been
upon
record
and
its
resolve
in
this
regard
remains
unshaken
lord
ampthill
then
went
on
to
say
a
further
consequence
of
certain
happenings
of
the
war
is
to
make
more
firm
our
resolve
to
keep
as
far
as
in
us
lies
freemasonry
strictly
away
from
participation
in
politics
either
national
or
international
this
attitude
of
aloofness
from
necessarily
controversial
affairs
of
state
on
which
brethren
can
legitimately
and
most
properly
differ
has
ever
been
maintained
by
our
grand
lodge
since
it
was
first
convened
in
because
of
this
it
held
aloof
from
such
international
conferences
as
were
summoned
during
the
war
and
never
more
than
now
has
the
necessity
for
the
maintenance
of
this
attitude
been
felt
by
british
freemasons
for
these
reasons
the
invitation
to
participate
in
the
proposed
international
conference
of
freemasons
at
geneva
can
not
be
accepted
such
an
assembly
might
be
termed
informal
but
inevitably
it
would
be
regarded
as
opening
a
door
to
compromise
on
those
things
which
this
grand
lodge
has
always
held
to
be
essentials
such
a
compromise
english
freemasonry
will
never
contemplate
on
these
essentials
we
take
the
firm
stand
we
have
always
done
we
can
not
detract
from
full
recognition
of
the
great
architect
of
the
universe
and
we
shall
continue
to
forbid
the
introduction
of
political
discussion
into
our
lodges
british
masonry
has
thus
taken
a
firm
stand
against
the
grand
orient
but
it
is
regrettable
that
views
so
admirably
expressed
should
be
confined
to
masonic
correspondence
and
not
made
more
apparent
to
the
world
in
general
on
the
continent
outside
masonic
circles
the
difference
between
british
masonry
and
the
grand
orient
variety
is
sufficiently
known
and
the
reticence
of
leading
british
masons
on
this
subject
has
not
only
played
into
the
hands
of
the
intractable
who
declare
all
masonry
to
be
harmful
but
has
strengthened
the
position
of
the
revolutionaries
who
use
masonry
for
a
subversive
purpose
thus
in
the
portuguese
revolution
of
the
masons
of
that
country
who
were
directing
the
movement
sheltered
themselves
behind
the
good
name
of
england
how
can
you
accuse
the
lodges
of
being
murder
clubs
they
said
to
the
people
when
masonry
is
directed
by
england
and
had
king
edward
for
its
grand
master
however
ludicrous
all
this
may
seem
to
the
british
public
yet
for
the
honour
of
our
country
such
accusations
should
not
remain
unrefuted
a
witness
of
the
disorders
that
took
place
in
portugal
declared
to
the
present
writer
that
if
only
grand
lodge
of
england
would
have
published
a
notice
in
the
continental
press
disassociating
itself
from
the
grand
orient
in
general
and
from
portuguese
freemasonry
in
particular
the
power
of
the
revolutionaries
would
have
been
immensely
weakened
and
the
and
propaganda
then
circulating
in
the
country
defeated
but
british
freemasonry
preferred
to
maintain
an
attitude
of
aloofness
contenting
itself
with
issuing
periodical
warnings
against
the
grand
orient
privately
to
the
lodges
this
policy
has
done
much
to
damage
not
only
the
good
name
of
england
but
of
british
masonry
in
the
eyes
of
the
outside
world
and
particularly
in
those
of
roman
catholics
which
is
the
more
regrettable
since
freemasonry
and
the
roman
catholic
church
are
the
only
two
organized
bodies
in
this
country
which
really
exercise
discipline
over
their
members
and
forbid
them
to
belong
to
subversive
secret
societies
hence
they
provide
the
two
strongest
bulwarks
against
the
occult
forces
of
revolution
for
this
reason
as
we
shall
see
later
they
are
the
two
bodies
which
are
the
most
feared
by
the
recruiting
agents
of
these
societies
but
in
the
case
of
freemasonry
the
fact
is
unfortunately
too
little
known
to
the
world
in
general
as
a
singularly
jesuit
has
recently
expressed
it
the
and
revolutionary
activities
of
continental
freemasonry
did
not
begin
when
the
grand
orient
finally
abolished
god
during
a
century
and
more
these
evil
forces
had
been
at
work
nevertheless
english
masons
only
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
looked
another
way
though
the
true
character
of
foreign
masonry
was
brought
to
their
notice
in
such
books
as
that
of
john
robison
of
a
conspiracy
against
all
the
religions
and
governments
of
no
doubt
the
same
writer
says
again
there
has
been
at
times
a
deplorable
amount
of
exaggeration
among
continental
catholics
in
attributing
all
the
moral
and
social
evils
of
the
world
to
the
insidious
workings
of
freemasonry
but
so
long
as
english
freemasons
resolutely
avert
their
gaze
from
the
and
activities
of
their
continental
brethren
there
can
be
no
hope
of
any
better
understanding
it
is
impossible
to
deny
the
truth
of
these
strictures
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
in
the
course
of
this
book
british
freemasons
have
frequently
not
only
ignored
robison
warning
but
vilified
him
as
the
enemy
of
masonry
although
he
never
attacked
their
order
but
only
the
perverted
systems
of
the
continent
too
often
also
they
have
exonerated
the
most
dangerous
secret
societies
notably
the
illuminati
because
apparently
from
a
mistaken
sense
of
loyalty
they
conceive
it
their
duty
to
defend
any
association
of
a
masonic
character
this
is
simply
suicidal
british
masonry
has
no
bitterer
enemies
than
the
secret
societies
working
for
subversion
which
from
the
illuminati
onwards
have
always
regarded
honest
masonry
with
contempt
and
used
its
doctrines
for
an
ulterior
purpose
it
is
easy
to
see
how
these
doctrines
may
be
perverted
to
an
end
directly
opposed
to
that
which
british
masons
have
in
view
thus
for
example
the
idea
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
in
the
sense
of
love
for
all
humanity
is
the
essence
of
christianity
be
kindly
affectioned
one
to
another
with
brotherly
love
in
honour
preferring
one
another
in
adopting
brotherly
love
as
a
part
of
their
sacred
trilogy
british
masons
adopt
an
entirely
christian
standpoint
but
if
by
the
brotherhood
of
man
is
meant
that
men
of
every
race
are
equally
related
and
that
therefore
one
owes
the
same
duty
to
foreigners
as
to
it
is
obvious
that
all
national
feeling
must
vanish
the
british
freemason
does
not
of
course
interpret
the
theory
in
this
manner
he
can
not
seriously
regard
himself
as
the
brother
of
the
bambute
pygmy
or
the
polynesian
cannibal
thus
he
uses
the
term
merely
in
a
vague
and
theoretical
sense
what
indeed
does
the
word
brother
literally
mean
if
we
consult
the
dictionary
we
shall
see
it
defined
as
a
male
born
of
the
same
parents
anyone
closely
united
with
or
resembling
one
another
associated
in
common
interests
occupation
etc
it
is
therefore
obviously
absurd
to
say
that
men
of
such
different
races
as
those
referred
to
are
brothers
they
are
not
born
of
the
same
kind
of
parents
they
are
not
united
in
their
aims
they
do
not
remotely
resemble
one
another
and
they
are
not
associated
in
common
interests
and
occupations
though
these
happen
to
be
extreme
cases
there
are
nevertheless
essential
differences
between
men
of
the
same
zone
and
climate
the
englishman
and
the
frenchman
are
not
brothers
because
they
do
not
see
life
from
the
same
point
of
view
but
that
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
be
close
allies
the
brotherhood
of
man
if
taken
literally
is
therefore
a
misleading
term
nor
is
such
a
relationship
necessary
to
the
peace
of
the
world
cain
and
abel
were
not
better
friends
for
being
brothers
david
and
jonathan
on
the
other
hand
were
not
brothers
but
devoted
friends
in
striving
after
universal
brotherhood
in
a
literal
sense
freemasons
are
therefore
pursuing
a
chimera
the
most
dangerous
fallacy
to
which
democracy
under
the
influence
of
illuminized
freemasonry
has
succumbed
is
that
peace
between
nations
can
be
brought
about
by
means
of
internationalism
that
is
to
say
by
the
destruction
of
national
feeling
yet
a
man
is
not
more
likely
to
live
at
peace
with
his
neighbours
because
he
is
devoid
of
natural
affection
on
the
contrary
the
good
brother
the
devoted
father
is
most
likely
to
become
the
faithful
friend
permanent
peace
between
nations
will
probably
never
be
ensured
but
the
only
basis
on
which
such
a
situation
can
conceivably
be
established
is
the
basis
of
sane
nationalism
an
understanding
between
the
patriotic
and
virile
elements
in
every
country
which
because
they
value
their
own
liberties
and
revere
their
own
traditions
are
able
to
respect
those
of
other
nations
internationalism
is
an
understanding
between
the
decadent
elements
in
each
country
the
conscientious
objectors
the
socialists
the
visionaries
who
shirk
the
realities
of
life
and
as
the
socialist
karl
kautsky
in
a
description
of
idealists
has
admirably
expressed
it
see
only
differences
of
opinion
and
misapprehension
where
there
are
actually
irreconcilable
antagonisms
this
is
why
at
times
of
crisis
idealists
are
of
all
men
the
most
dangerous
and
pacifists
the
great
promoters
of
wars
understanding
between
nations
is
wholly
desirable
but
the
destruction
of
the
national
spirit
everywhere
can
only
lead
to
the
weakening
of
all
countries
where
this
process
takes
place
and
the
triumph
of
the
nations
who
refuse
to
accept
the
same
principle
it
will
perhaps
be
answered
that
freemasons
do
not
believe
in
the
doctrine
of
brotherhood
between
all
men
but
only
between
masons
of
all
races
but
this
may
lead
no
less
to
national
disintegration
if
it
creates
a
nation
within
each
nation
an
international
fraternity
independent
of
the
countries
to
which
its
members
belong
the
logical
outcome
of
this
may
be
that
a
man
will
refuse
to
fight
for
his
country
against
his
brother
masons
it
is
what
has
happened
in
france
the
grand
orient
was
before
the
recent
war
the
great
of
where
all
schemes
for
national
defence
were
discouraged
before
the
same
thing
took
place
and
it
was
in
the
masonic
lodges
that
germany
found
her
most
valuable
allies
in
the
same
way
the
doctrine
of
the
perfectibility
of
human
nature
lends
itself
to
perversion
nothing
could
be
more
desirable
than
that
man
should
strive
after
perfection
did
not
christ
enjoin
his
disciples
be
ye
therefore
perfect
even
as
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
is
perfect
man
is
therefore
acting
in
accordance
with
christian
principles
in
seeking
after
divine
perfection
but
when
he
comes
to
believe
that
he
has
already
attained
it
he
makes
of
himself
a
god
if
i
justify
myself
said
job
mine
own
mouth
shall
condemn
me
if
i
say
i
am
perfect
it
shall
also
prove
me
perverse
and
john
if
we
say
we
have
no
sin
we
deceive
ourselves
and
the
truth
is
not
in
us
more
than
this
if
we
seek
perfection
in
others
we
deceive
ourselves
equally
and
make
gods
of
men
this
is
precisely
the
conclusion
at
which
perverted
freemasonry
and
the
forms
of
socialism
deriving
from
it
arrive
human
nature
they
say
is
itself
divine
what
need
then
for
other
divinities
the
catholic
church
is
consequently
quite
right
in
declaring
that
the
doctrine
of
the
perfectibility
of
human
nature
leads
to
the
deification
of
humanity
in
that
it
puts
humanity
in
the
place
of
god
the
grand
orient
which
definitely
accepts
this
doctrine
has
therefore
logically
erased
the
name
of
the
great
architect
of
the
universe
from
its
ritual
and
has
become
an
association
of
freethinkers
and
atheists
is
it
necessary
to
point
out
the
folly
as
well
as
the
crime
of
this
delusion
the
ludicrous
inconsequence
of
men
who
divinize
humanity
yet
revile
what
they
call
society
all
the
evils
of
the
world
they
declare
are
not
to
be
found
in
nature
but
in
laws
in
the
institutions
of
society
yet
what
is
society
but
the
outcome
of
human
wills
of
human
aspirations
society
may
be
and
no
doubt
is
in
need
of
reformation
but
are
not
its
imperfections
the
creation
of
imperfect
beings
it
is
true
that
the
world
is
in
a
state
of
chaos
industrial
chaos
political
chaos
social
chaos
religious
chaos
everywhere
men
are
losing
faith
in
the
causes
they
are
supposed
to
represent
authority
questions
its
own
right
to
govern
democracy
is
rent
with
divisions
the
ruling
classes
are
abdicating
in
favour
of
unscrupulous
demagogues
the
ministers
of
religion
barter
their
faith
for
popularity
and
what
has
brought
the
world
to
this
pass
humanity
humanity
that
abstraction
that
needs
no
light
from
heaven
humanity
that
was
to
take
the
place
of
god
if
ever
there
was
a
moment
in
the
history
of
the
world
when
the
futility
of
this
pretension
should
be
apparent
it
is
the
present
moment
all
the
ills
all
the
confusion
what
are
they
but
the
outcome
of
human
error
and
of
human
passions
it
is
not
capitalism
that
has
failed
nor
yet
democracy
nor
yet
even
socialism
as
a
principle
it
is
not
monarchy
that
has
broken
down
nor
republicanism
nor
again
religion
is
humanity
that
has
broken
the
ills
of
capitalism
arise
from
the
egoism
of
individual
capitalists
socialism
has
failed
because
as
robert
owen
discovered
the
idle
the
quarrelsome
the
selfish
have
prevented
its
success
if
men
were
perfect
socialism
might
succeed
but
so
might
any
other
system
a
perfect
capitalist
would
love
his
employee
as
himself
just
as
a
perfect
socialist
would
be
willing
to
work
for
the
common
good
it
is
the
imperfections
of
human
nature
that
prevent
and
will
always
prevent
any
system
from
being
perfect
there
will
never
be
a
millennium
of
making
only
the
application
of
christian
principles
to
human
conduct
can
bring
about
a
better
order
of
things
grand
orient
masonry
in
deifying
human
nature
thus
not
only
builds
upon
the
sand
but
by
its
rejection
of
all
religion
takes
away
the
sole
hope
of
human
progress
meanwhile
by
the
support
it
lends
to
socialism
it
encourages
the
class
war
instead
of
the
brotherhood
between
men
of
all
ranks
and
conditions
which
it
professes
to
advocate
british
freemasonry
on
the
other
hand
whilst
not
interpreting
brotherhood
in
a
political
sense
nevertheless
contributes
to
social
peace
at
the
annual
conference
of
the
labour
party
in
a
proposal
was
made
by
the
extreme
section
that
any
person
who
is
a
free
mason
should
be
excluded
from
any
kind
of
office
it
being
suggested
that
in
cases
where
an
understanding
has
been
reached
between
trade
union
leaders
and
employers
thus
preventing
or
limiting
industrial
trouble
the
secret
has
been
the
bond
of
freemasonry
whether
this
was
the
case
or
not
british
masonry
by
taking
its
stand
on
patriotism
and
respect
for
religion
necessarily
tends
to
unite
men
of
all
classes
and
therefore
offers
a
formidable
bulwark
against
the
forces
of
revolution
any
attacks
on
british
masonry
as
at
present
constituted
and
directed
are
therefore
absolutely
opposed
to
the
interests
of
the
country
but
at
the
same
time
it
behoves
masons
to
beware
of
the
insidious
attempts
that
are
being
made
by
irregular
secret
societies
to
infiltrate
the
craft
and
pervert
its
true
principles
the
present
satisfactory
condition
of
freemasonry
in
england
is
owing
not
only
to
its
established
statutes
but
to
the
character
of
the
men
who
control
it
men
who
are
not
as
in
france
mere
figureheads
but
the
real
directors
of
the
order
should
the
control
ever
pass
into
the
wrong
hands
and
the
agents
of
secret
societies
succeed
in
capturing
a
number
of
the
lodges
this
great
stabilizing
force
might
become
a
gigantic
engine
of
destruction
how
insidiously
these
efforts
are
being
made
we
shall
see
in
the
next
chapter
secret
societies
in
england
we
have
seen
that
from
the
illuminati
onwards
subversive
societies
have
always
sought
recruits
amongst
orthodox
freemasons
the
reason
for
this
is
obvious
not
only
do
the
doctrines
of
freemasonry
lend
themselves
to
perversion
but
the
training
provided
in
the
lodges
makes
an
admirable
preparation
for
initiation
into
other
secret
systems
the
man
who
has
learnt
to
maintain
silence
even
on
what
may
appear
to
him
as
trivialities
who
is
willing
to
submit
to
mystification
to
ask
no
questions
and
to
recognize
the
authority
of
superiors
whom
he
is
in
no
way
legally
obliged
to
obey
who
has
moreover
become
imbued
with
the
de
which
binds
him
to
his
in
a
common
cause
is
naturally
a
better
subject
for
the
secret
society
adept
than
the
free
lance
who
is
liable
to
assert
his
independence
at
any
moment
perhaps
the
most
important
factor
however
is
the
nature
of
the
masonic
oaths
these
terrible
penalties
which
many
freemasons
themselves
regret
as
a
survival
of
barbarism
and
which
have
in
fact
been
abolished
in
the
higher
degrees
have
done
much
to
create
prejudice
against
freemasonry
whilst
at
the
same
time
they
provide
an
additional
incentive
to
outside
intriguers
in
the
opinion
of
copin
albancelli
the
abolition
of
the
oath
would
go
far
to
prevent
penetration
of
british
masonry
by
the
secret
societies
now
by
their
obligations
british
freemasons
are
forbidden
to
join
these
irregular
societies
not
only
because
their
principles
are
in
conflict
with
those
of
orthodox
masonry
but
because
in
most
cases
they
admit
women
according
to
the
ruling
of
grand
lodge
any
member
working
under
the
english
jurisdiction
violates
his
obligation
by
being
present
at
or
assisting
in
assemblies
professing
to
be
masonic
which
are
attended
by
women
warnings
to
this
effect
have
been
frequently
given
in
the
lodges
on
september
the
board
of
general
purposes
issued
the
following
report
the
board
attention
is
being
increasingly
drawn
to
sedulous
endeavours
which
are
being
made
by
certain
bodies
unrecognized
as
masonic
by
the
united
grand
lodge
of
england
to
induce
freemasons
to
join
in
their
assemblies
as
all
such
bodies
which
admit
women
to
membership
are
clandestine
and
irregular
it
is
necessary
to
caution
brethren
against
being
inadvertently
led
to
violate
their
obligation
by
becoming
members
of
them
or
attending
their
meetings
grand
lodge
nine
years
since
approved
the
action
of
the
board
in
suspending
from
all
masonic
rights
and
privileges
two
brethren
who
had
contumaciously
failed
to
explain
the
grave
masonic
irregularity
to
which
attention
is
now
again
called
and
it
is
earnestly
hoped
that
no
occasion
will
arise
for
having
again
to
institute
disciplinary
proceedings
of
a
like
kind
the
idea
of
women
masons
is
of
course
not
a
new
one
as
early
as
lodges
for
women
are
said
to
have
existed
in
france
and
towards
the
end
of
the
century
several
excellent
women
such
as
the
duchesse
de
bourbon
and
the
princesse
de
lamballe
played
a
leading
part
in
the
order
but
this
as
it
was
called
retained
a
purely
convivial
character
a
sham
ceremonial
with
symbols
pass
words
and
a
ritual
was
devised
as
a
consolation
to
the
members
for
their
exclusion
from
the
real
lodges
these
mummeries
were
as
ragon
observes
only
the
pretexts
for
assemblies
the
real
objects
were
the
banquet
and
the
ball
which
were
their
inevitable
accompaniments
but
this
precedent
inaugurated
as
a
society
pastime
and
accompanied
by
all
the
frivolity
of
the
age
paved
the
way
for
weishaupt
two
classes
of
women
members
who
although
never
initiated
into
the
secrets
of
the
order
were
to
act
as
useful
tools
directed
by
men
without
knowing
it
for
this
purpose
they
were
to
be
divided
into
two
classes
the
virtuous
to
play
the
part
of
figureheads
or
decoys
and
the
who
were
to
carry
out
the
real
designs
of
the
order
the
same
plan
was
adopted
nearly
a
hundred
years
later
by
disciple
bakunin
who
however
did
admit
women
as
actual
initiates
into
his
secret
society
the
alliance
sociale
démocratique
but
like
weishaupt
divided
them
into
classes
the
sixth
category
of
people
to
be
employed
in
the
work
of
social
revolution
is
thus
described
in
his
programme
the
sixth
category
is
very
important
they
are
the
women
who
must
be
divided
into
three
classes
the
first
frivolous
women
without
mind
or
heart
which
we
must
use
in
the
same
manner
as
the
third
and
fourth
categories
of
men
by
getting
hold
of
their
dirty
secrets
and
making
them
our
slaves
the
second
the
ardent
devoted
and
capable
women
but
who
are
not
ours
because
they
have
not
reached
a
practical
revolutionary
understanding
without
phrase
we
must
make
use
of
these
like
the
men
of
the
fifth
category
by
drawing
them
incessantly
into
practical
and
perilous
manifestations
which
will
result
in
making
the
majority
of
them
disappear
while
making
some
of
them
genuine
revolutionaries
finally
the
women
who
are
entirely
with
us
that
is
to
say
completely
initiated
and
having
accepted
our
programme
in
its
entirety
we
ought
to
consider
them
as
the
most
precious
of
our
treasures
without
whose
help
we
can
do
nothing
the
first
and
only
woman
to
be
admitted
into
real
masonry
if
such
a
term
can
be
applied
to
so
heterogeneous
a
system
was
maria
deraismes
an
ardent
french
feminist
celebrated
for
her
political
speeches
and
electioneering
campaigns
in
the
district
of
pontoise
and
for
years
the
acknowledged
leader
of
the
and
feminist
party
in
maria
deraismes
was
initiated
into
freemasonry
by
the
members
of
the
lodge
libres
deriving
from
the
grande
loge
symbolique
écossaise
and
situated
at
pecq
in
the
department
of
the
proceeding
being
however
entirely
unconstitutional
maria
deraismes
initiation
was
declared
by
the
grande
loge
to
be
null
and
void
and
the
lodge
libres
was
disgraced
but
some
years
afterwards
george
martin
an
enthusiastic
advocate
of
votes
for
women
collaborated
with
maria
deraismes
in
founding
the
at
the
first
lodge
of
the
order
named
le
droit
humain
the
conseil
universel
was
founded
in
the
maçonnerie
mixte
was
political
and
in
no
way
theosophical
or
occult
and
its
programme
like
that
of
the
grand
orient
was
utopian
socialism
whilst
by
its
insistence
on
the
supremacy
of
reason
it
definitely
proclaimed
its
antagonism
to
all
revealed
religion
thus
in
the
involved
language
of
george
martin
himself
the
ordre
maçonnique
mixte
internationale
is
the
first
mixed
philosophic
progressive
and
philanthropic
masonic
power
to
be
organized
and
constituted
in
the
world
placed
above
all
the
prooccupations
of
the
philosophical
or
religious
ideas
which
may
be
professed
by
those
who
ask
to
become
members
the
order
wishes
to
interest
itself
principally
in
the
vital
interests
of
the
human
being
on
earth
it
wishes
above
all
to
study
in
its
temples
the
means
for
realizing
peace
between
all
nations
and
social
justice
which
will
enable
all
human
beings
to
enjoy
during
their
lives
the
greatest
possible
sum
of
moral
felicity
and
of
material
claiming
no
divine
revelation
and
loudly
affirming
that
it
is
only
an
emanation
of
human
reason
this
fraternal
institution
is
not
dogmatic
it
is
rationalist
into
this
materialist
and
political
club
erected
under
the
guise
of
freemasonry
entered
annie
besant
with
all
the
strange
conglomeration
of
eastern
doctrines
now
known
as
theosophy
theosophy
before
entering
on
this
question
it
is
necessary
to
make
my
own
position
clear
although
i
should
much
prefer
not
to
introduce
a
personal
note
into
the
discussion
i
feel
that
nothing
i
say
will
carry
any
weight
if
it
appears
to
be
an
expression
of
opinion
by
one
who
has
never
considered
religious
doctrines
from
anything
but
the
orthodox
christian
point
of
view
i
should
explain
then
that
i
have
known
theosophists
from
my
early
youth
that
i
have
travelled
in
india
ceylon
burma
and
japan
and
seen
much
to
admire
in
the
great
religions
of
the
east
i
do
not
believe
that
god
has
revealed
himself
to
one
portion
of
mankind
alone
and
that
during
only
the
last
years
of
the
world
history
i
do
not
accept
the
doctrine
that
all
the
millions
of
human
beings
who
have
never
heard
of
christ
are
plunged
in
spiritual
darkness
i
believe
that
behind
all
religions
founded
on
a
law
of
righteousness
there
lies
a
divine
and
central
truth
that
ikhnaton
moses
and
isaiah
socrates
and
epictetus
marcus
aurelius
buddha
zoroaster
and
mohammed
were
all
teachers
who
interpreted
to
men
the
aspect
of
the
divine
as
it
had
been
vouchsafed
to
them
and
which
in
harmony
with
the
supreme
revelation
given
to
man
by
jesus
christ
this
conception
of
an
affinity
between
all
great
religious
faiths
was
beautifully
expressed
by
an
old
mohammedan
to
a
friend
of
the
present
writer
with
whom
he
stood
watching
a
hindu
procession
pass
through
an
indian
village
in
answer
to
the
englishman
enquiry
what
do
you
think
of
this
the
mohammedan
replied
ah
sahib
we
can
not
tell
we
know
of
three
roads
up
the
hill
of
endeavour
to
the
gates
of
paradise
the
way
of
mousa
moses
the
way
of
issa
jesus
and
the
way
of
mahmoud
and
there
may
be
other
roads
of
which
you
and
i
know
nothing
i
was
born
in
the
way
of
mahmoud
and
i
believe
it
to
be
the
best
and
the
easiest
to
follow
and
you
were
born
in
the
way
of
issa
and
of
this
i
am
very
sure
that
if
you
will
follow
your
guide
on
your
road
and
i
follow
my
guide
on
my
road
when
we
have
climbed
the
hill
of
endeavour
we
shall
salute
one
another
again
at
the
gates
of
paradise
if
then
in
the
following
pages
i
attempt
to
show
the
errors
of
theosophy
it
is
not
because
i
do
not
recognize
that
there
is
much
that
is
good
and
beautiful
in
the
ancient
religions
from
which
it
professes
to
derive
but
what
is
theosophy
the
word
as
we
have
already
seen
was
used
in
the
eighteenth
century
to
denote
the
theory
of
the
martinists
it
was
known
two
centuries
earlier
when
haselmeyer
in
wrote
of
the
laudable
fraternity
of
the
theosophists
of
the
rosy
cross
according
to
colonel
olcott
who
with
madame
blavatsky
founded
the
modern
theosophical
society
in
new
york
in
the
word
was
discovered
by
one
of
the
members
in
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
dictionary
and
forthwith
unanimously
adopted
madame
blavatsky
had
arrived
in
america
two
years
earlier
before
which
date
she
professed
to
have
been
initiated
into
certain
esoteric
doctrines
in
thibet
monsieur
guénon
who
writes
with
inside
knowledge
of
the
movement
indicates
however
the
existence
of
concealed
superiors
on
the
continent
of
europe
by
whom
she
was
in
reality
directed
what
is
very
significant
is
that
madame
blavatsky
in
wrote
this
i
have
been
sent
from
paris
to
america
in
order
to
verify
phenomena
and
their
reality
and
to
show
the
deception
of
the
spiritualist
theory
sent
by
whom
later
she
will
say
by
the
mahatmas
but
then
there
was
no
question
of
them
and
besides
it
was
in
paris
that
she
received
her
mission
and
not
in
india
or
in
thibet
elsewhere
monsieur
guénon
observes
that
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
madame
blavatsky
was
ever
in
thibet
at
all
these
obvious
attempts
at
concealment
lead
monsieur
guénon
therefore
to
the
conclusion
that
in
the
background
of
theosophy
there
existed
a
mysterious
centre
of
direction
that
madame
blavatsky
was
simply
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
individuals
or
occult
groups
sheltering
behind
her
personality
and
that
those
who
believe
she
invented
everything
that
she
did
everything
by
herself
and
on
her
own
initiative
are
as
much
mistaken
as
those
who
on
the
contrary
believe
her
affirmations
concerning
her
relations
with
the
pretended
mahatmas
there
is
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
people
under
whom
madame
blavatsky
was
working
at
this
date
in
paris
were
serapis
bey
and
tuiti
bey
who
belonged
to
the
egyptian
brothers
this
might
answer
guénon
question
by
whom
was
she
sent
to
america
but
another
passage
from
madame
blavatsky
writings
on
the
person
of
christ
that
guénon
quotes
later
indicates
a
further
source
of
inspiration
for
me
jesus
christ
that
is
to
say
the
of
the
christians
copy
of
the
avatars
of
all
countries
of
the
hindu
chrishna
as
of
the
egyptian
horus
was
never
a
personage
hence
the
story
of
his
life
was
merely
an
allegory
founded
on
the
existence
of
a
personage
named
jehoshua
born
at
lud
but
elsewhere
she
asserted
that
jesus
may
have
lived
during
the
christian
era
or
a
century
earlier
the
sepher
toldoth
jehoshua
my
italics
and
madame
blavatsky
went
on
to
say
of
the
savants
who
deny
the
historical
value
of
this
legend
that
they
either
lie
or
talk
nonsense
is
our
masters
who
affirm
my
italics
if
the
history
of
jehoshua
or
jesus
ben
pandera
is
false
then
the
whole
of
the
talmud
the
whole
of
the
jewish
canon
law
is
false
it
was
the
disciple
of
jehoshua
ben
parachia
the
fifth
president
of
the
sanhedrim
since
ezra
who
the
bible
this
story
is
much
truer
than
that
of
the
new
testament
of
which
history
does
not
say
a
word
who
were
the
masters
whose
authority
madame
blavatsky
here
invokes
clearly
not
the
brotherhood
to
whom
she
habitually
refers
by
this
term
and
who
can
certainly
not
be
suspected
of
affirming
the
authenticity
of
the
toldoth
yeshu
it
is
evident
then
that
there
were
other
masters
from
whom
madame
blavatsky
received
this
teaching
and
that
those
other
masters
were
cabalists
the
same
judaic
influence
appears
more
strongly
in
a
book
published
by
the
theosophical
society
in
where
the
talmud
and
the
toledot
yeshu
are
quoted
at
great
length
and
the
christians
are
derided
for
resenting
the
attacks
on
their
faith
contained
in
these
books
whilst
the
jews
are
represented
as
innocent
persecuted
victims
one
passage
will
suffice
to
give
an
idea
of
the
author
point
of
view
the
christ
said
the
mystics
was
born
of
a
virgin
the
unwitting
believer
in
jesus
as
historical
messiah
in
the
exclusive
jewish
sense
and
in
his
being
son
of
god
nay
god
himself
in
course
of
time
asserted
that
mary
was
that
virgin
whereupon
rabbinical
logic
which
in
this
case
was
simple
and
common
logic
met
this
extravagance
by
the
natural
retort
that
seeing
that
his
paternity
was
unacknowledged
jesus
was
therefore
illegitimate
a
bastard
it
is
obviously
then
less
from
thibetan
mahatmas
hindu
swamis
sikh
gurus
or
egyptian
brothers
than
from
jewish
cabalists
that
these
leaders
of
theosophy
have
borrowed
their
ideas
on
jesus
christ
as
the
jewish
writer
adolphe
franck
has
truly
observed
dès
est
question
de
théosophie
on
est
sûr
de
voir
apparaître
la
kabbale
and
he
goes
on
to
show
the
direct
influence
of
cabalism
on
the
modern
theosophical
society
besant
without
endorsing
the
worst
blasphemies
of
the
toledot
yeshu
nevertheless
reflected
this
and
other
judaic
traditions
in
her
book
where
she
related
that
jesus
was
brought
up
amongst
the
essenes
and
that
later
he
went
to
egypt
where
he
became
an
initiate
of
the
great
esoteric
lodge
that
is
to
say
the
great
white
lodge
from
which
all
great
religions
derive
it
will
be
seen
that
this
is
only
a
version
of
the
old
story
of
the
talmudists
and
cabalists
perpetuated
by
the
gnostics
the
rosicrucians
and
the
du
but
according
to
one
of
besant
theosophical
antagonists
her
doctrine
rests
on
a
perpetual
equivocation
and
whilst
allowing
the
english
public
to
believe
that
when
she
spoke
of
the
coming
christ
she
referred
to
the
christ
of
the
gospels
she
stated
to
her
intimates
what
leadbeater
taught
in
his
book
inner
namely
that
the
christ
of
the
gospels
never
existed
but
was
an
invention
of
the
monks
of
the
second
century
it
should
be
understood
however
that
in
the
language
of
the
theosophists
led
by
besant
and
leadbeater
jesus
and
the
christ
are
two
separate
and
distinct
individualities
and
that
when
they
now
speak
of
the
christ
they
refer
to
someone
living
in
a
bungalow
in
the
himalayas
with
whom
leadbeater
has
interviews
to
arrange
about
his
approaching
advent
portraits
of
this
person
have
been
distributed
amongst
the
members
of
the
star
in
the
east
an
order
founded
at
benares
in
by
leadbeater
and
krishnamurti
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
the
world
for
the
coming
of
the
great
teacher
but
it
is
time
to
return
to
the
alliance
between
theosophy
and
the
maçonnerie
mixte
whether
besant
who
had
begun
her
career
as
a
freethinker
retained
some
lingering
belief
in
her
earlier
creed
at
the
time
she
entered
into
relations
with
the
order
or
whether
she
saw
in
this
materialistic
society
a
valuable
concrete
organization
for
the
dissemination
of
her
new
esoteric
theories
it
is
impossible
to
know
at
any
rate
she
rose
rapidly
through
the
succeeding
degrees
and
became
before
long
vice
president
of
the
which
appointed
her
its
national
delegate
to
great
britain
it
was
in
this
capacity
that
she
founded
the
english
branch
of
the
order
under
the
name
of
that
is
admitting
both
sexes
at
the
lodge
human
duty
in
london
which
was
consecrated
on
september
and
later
founded
another
lodge
at
adyar
in
india
named
the
rising
sun
the
number
of
lodges
on
the
grand
roll
of
including
those
abroad
is
now
said
to
be
no
less
than
thus
receives
a
direction
for
whilst
remaining
in
constant
correspondence
with
the
conseil
universel
situated
at
rue
in
paris
and
presided
over
by
the
grand
master
piron
with
madame
amélie
gédalje
degree
as
grand
it
receives
further
instructions
from
the
annie
besant
at
adyar
in
order
not
to
shock
the
susceptibilities
of
english
adepts
who
might
be
repelled
by
the
rationalist
tendencies
of
the
maçonnerie
mixte
besant
has
however
borrowed
the
formulas
of
british
masonry
together
with
its
custom
of
placing
the
on
the
table
in
the
lodges
these
conflicting
doctrines
are
blended
in
an
amusing
manner
on
the
certificates
of
the
order
where
at
the
top
we
find
the
french
motto
and
initials
liberté
égalité
fraternité
à
la
gloire
de
and
below
for
the
benefit
of
english
members
the
initials
of
the
british
masonic
device
that
does
not
of
course
appear
on
the
diplomas
of
the
french
order
which
like
the
grand
orient
has
rejected
the
great
architect
to
the
glory
of
the
great
architect
of
the
universe
our
therefore
enjoy
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
choose
whether
they
shall
render
glory
to
god
or
to
humanity
that
the
two
devices
are
somewhat
incompatible
does
not
appear
to
strike
the
english
initiates
nor
do
they
probably
realize
the
imposture
practised
on
them
by
the
further
wording
of
the
certificate
which
after
announcing
in
imposing
capitals
to
all
masons
dispersed
over
both
hemispheres
greeting
goes
on
to
say
we
therefore
recommend
him
her
as
such
to
all
freemasons
of
the
globe
requesting
them
to
recognize
him
her
in
all
the
rights
and
privileges
attached
to
this
degree
as
we
will
do
to
all
presenting
themselves
under
similar
circumstances
now
any
british
mason
will
see
at
a
glance
that
all
this
is
a
false
pretension
no
order
of
masonry
can
recommend
its
members
for
rights
and
privileges
to
all
the
freemasons
of
the
world
for
the
simple
reason
that
as
has
been
said
there
is
no
such
thing
as
universal
masonry
so
that
even
grand
lodge
of
england
the
most
important
lodge
in
the
world
could
not
if
it
would
accord
the
right
of
entry
for
its
members
into
continental
lodges
as
an
english
mason
recently
expressed
it
the
impression
among
generally
appears
to
be
that
a
british
or
irish
member
of
the
craft
is
able
to
enter
a
masonic
lodge
in
any
part
of
the
world
and
take
part
in
its
deliberations
and
proceedings
to
this
belief
an
unqualified
denial
may
at
once
be
given
nor
may
a
member
of
a
lodge
under
any
jurisdiction
not
in
communion
with
the
grand
lodges
of
the
united
kingdom
be
received
as
a
visitor
or
as
a
joining
member
in
any
subsidiary
lodge
of
the
grand
lodges
of
england
ireland
or
scotland
but
for
to
make
this
claim
is
even
more
ridiculous
since
at
the
time
when
the
above
quoted
diploma
was
drawn
up
and
its
parent
the
maçonnerie
mixte
were
not
recognized
by
any
other
order
of
masonry
except
the
droit
humain
and
it
is
not
only
unrecognized
but
utterly
repudiated
by
grand
lodge
of
england
the
british
mason
in
fact
does
not
recognize
the
as
a
mason
at
all
and
would
violate
his
obligations
by
discussing
masonic
secrets
with
him
or
her
so
that
there
is
no
manner
in
which
the
could
be
accorded
masonic
rights
and
privileges
by
british
masons
in
order
further
to
keep
up
the
illusion
in
the
minds
of
its
members
that
they
are
genuine
masons
in
its
quarterly
organ
is
careful
to
include
masonic
news
relating
to
british
masonry
as
if
it
formed
one
and
the
same
order
with
regard
to
the
grand
orient
an
equally
tortuous
policy
was
pursued
as
we
have
already
seen
the
grande
loge
disgraced
the
lodge
that
had
admitted
maria
deraismes
and
did
not
officially
recognize
the
maçonnerie
mixte
the
ritual
adopted
by
the
latter
order
was
however
not
that
of
british
masonry
and
in
most
lodges
the
ritual
employed
contains
variations
derived
from
the
grand
orient
indeed
the
grand
orient
character
of
has
always
been
generally
recognized
in
masonic
circles
this
being
so
i
pointed
out
in
that
derives
from
the
grand
orient
but
i
received
the
following
protest
from
a
woman
are
you
aware
that
for
twenty
years
the
grand
orient
has
refused
to
recognize
it
as
a
legitimate
body
just
as
the
english
orthodox
masons
do
now
also
we
are
distinctly
told
before
joining
that
we
shall
not
be
recognized
by
that
body
also
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
illuminati
or
with
germany
as
the
grand
orient
have
eliminated
the
deity
it
is
rather
a
dreadful
thing
to
a
mason
to
be
connected
in
any
way
with
that
order
and
i
can
not
imagine
a
worse
thing
could
be
said
about
us
this
letter
was
dated
march
and
on
the
of
the
preceding
month
of
february
an
alliance
between
the
grand
orient
and
had
been
finally
celebrated
at
the
grand
temple
of
the
droit
humain
in
paris
we
find
a
report
of
this
ceremony
in
the
for
the
following
april
it
is
evident
therefore
that
members
who
were
likely
to
be
repelled
by
the
idea
of
connexion
with
the
grand
orient
were
assured
that
no
such
connexion
existed
but
when
this
covert
developed
into
official
recognition
although
this
did
not
include
the
right
of
entry
to
the
lodges
of
the
grand
orient
for
women
members
the
triumphant
manner
in
which
the
great
event
was
announced
in
the
suggests
that
the
majority
of
members
were
likely
to
feel
nothing
but
satisfaction
at
association
with
the
order
that
had
eliminated
the
deity
it
is
true
that
a
few
members
protested
and
by
this
time
was
too
completely
under
the
control
of
besant
for
any
faction
to
question
her
dictates
moreover
the
opposition
had
been
weakened
by
a
schism
which
took
place
in
the
order
in
when
a
number
of
members
who
objected
to
the
introduction
of
eastern
occultism
into
masonry
and
likewise
disapproved
of
the
grand
orient
formed
themselves
into
a
separate
body
under
halsey
and
geikie
cobb
working
only
the
craft
degrees
according
to
the
grand
lodge
of
england
it
has
been
shown
by
this
brief
résumé
that
is
a
hybrid
system
deriving
from
two
conflicting
sources
the
political
and
rationalist
doctrines
of
the
and
the
eastern
occultism
of
madame
blavatsky
and
besant
as
a
professing
buddhist
madame
blavatsky
consistently
dissociated
herself
from
any
schemes
of
material
welfare
thus
in
the
early
constitution
of
the
theosophical
society
it
is
stated
the
society
repudiates
all
interference
on
its
behalf
with
the
governmental
relations
of
any
nation
or
community
confining
its
attention
exclusively
to
the
matters
set
forth
in
the
present
document
these
matters
relate
to
the
study
of
occult
sciences
again
madame
blavatsky
herself
wrote
in
the
unconcerned
about
politics
hostile
to
the
insane
dreams
of
socialism
and
communism
which
it
abhors
as
both
are
but
disguised
conspiracies
of
brutal
force
and
selfishness
against
honest
labour
the
society
cares
but
little
about
the
outward
human
management
of
the
material
world
the
whole
of
its
aspirations
are
directed
towards
the
occult
truths
of
the
visible
and
invisible
worlds
it
will
be
seen
that
this
declaration
is
diametrically
opposed
to
that
of
the
maçonnerie
mixte
nevertheless
madame
blavatsky
so
far
departed
from
her
purely
occult
programme
after
her
arrival
in
india
in
as
to
reconstruct
the
society
on
the
basis
of
universal
brotherhood
this
idea
was
completely
absent
from
her
first
scheme
the
brotherhood
plank
in
the
society
future
platform
wrote
her
coadjutor
colonel
olcott
was
not
thought
of
it
was
over
this
plank
however
that
besant
was
able
to
walk
to
the
supreme
council
of
the
maçonnerie
mixte
and
adding
liberty
and
equality
to
the
principle
of
fraternity
to
establish
on
a
definitely
political
basis
as
a
preparation
for
the
socialist
doctrines
her
teacher
had
abhorred
in
the
matter
of
esoteric
doctrines
besant
again
departed
from
the
path
laid
down
by
madame
blavatsky
whose
aim
had
been
to
rehabilitate
buddhism
in
india
representing
the
teachings
of
gautama
buddha
as
an
advance
on
hinduism
besant
however
came
to
regard
the
doctrines
of
the
brahmins
as
the
purer
faith
yet
it
was
neither
buddhism
nor
hinduism
in
a
pure
form
that
she
introduced
to
the
of
the
west
but
an
occult
system
of
her
own
devising
wherein
mahatmas
swamis
and
gurus
were
incongruously
mingled
with
the
charlatans
of
france
thus
in
the
lodges
we
find
the
king
inscribed
over
the
grand
master
chair
in
the
east
in
the
north
the
empty
chair
of
the
master
to
which
until
recently
all
members
were
required
to
bow
in
passing
and
over
it
a
picture
veiled
in
some
lodges
of
the
same
mysterious
personage
should
the
neophyte
enquire
who
is
the
king
he
may
be
told
that
he
is
the
king
who
is
to
come
from
india
whether
he
is
identical
with
the
young
hindu
krishnamurti
adopted
by
besant
in
is
not
clear
whilst
the
question
who
is
the
master
will
probably
be
met
with
the
reply
that
he
is
the
master
of
all
true
freemasons
throughout
the
world
which
the
enquirer
takes
to
mean
the
head
of
the
religion
to
which
he
happens
to
belong
christ
mohammed
or
another
but
in
the
third
degree
the
astonishing
information
is
confided
with
an
appearance
of
great
secrecy
that
he
is
no
other
than
the
famous
comte
de
who
did
not
really
die
in
but
is
still
alive
in
hungary
under
the
name
of
ragocsky
in
yet
a
higher
degree
however
the
initiate
may
be
told
that
the
master
is
in
reality
prince
eugene
of
austria
it
would
be
superfluous
to
describe
in
detail
the
wild
nonsense
that
composes
the
creed
of
since
a
long
series
of
articles
was
recently
devoted
to
the
subject
in
and
can
be
consulted
by
anyone
who
desires
information
concerning
its
ceremonies
and
the
personnel
directing
it
suffice
it
to
say
here
that
its
course
like
that
of
most
secret
societies
has
been
marked
by
violent
dissensions
amongst
the
members
the
passionately
denouncing
the
besantites
and
the
besantites
proclaiming
the
divine
infallibility
of
their
leader
whilst
at
the
same
time
scandals
of
a
peculiarly
unsavoury
kind
have
been
brought
to
light
this
fact
has
indeed
created
a
serious
schism
in
the
ranks
of
the
theosophists
which
shows
that
a
number
of
perfectly
harmless
people
are
to
be
found
amongst
them
yet
the
peculiar
recurrence
of
such
scandals
in
the
history
of
secret
societies
leads
one
inevitably
to
wonder
how
far
these
are
to
be
regarded
as
merely
deplorable
accidents
or
as
the
results
of
methods
and
of
occult
teaching
that
the
men
against
whom
charges
of
sexual
perversion
were
brought
were
not
isolated
examples
of
these
tendencies
is
shown
by
a
curious
admission
on
the
part
of
one
of
madame
blavatsky
chelas
or
disciples
who
relates
i
was
a
pupil
of
before
besant
joined
the
and
saw
her
expel
one
of
her
most
gifted
and
valued
workers
from
the
esoteric
section
for
offences
against
the
occult
and
moral
law
similar
to
those
with
which
leadbeater
name
has
now
been
associated
for
nearly
twenty
years
was
always
extremely
strict
on
this
particular
point
and
my
itals
aspirants
for
chelaship
were
refused
on
this
one
ground
alone
while
others
who
had
been
accepted
on
probation
failed
almost
immediately
afterwards
it
would
appear
then
that
these
deplorable
proclivities
are
peculiarly
prevalent
amongst
aspirants
to
theosophical
knowledge
it
is
unnecessary
to
enlarge
at
length
on
besant
connexion
with
the
seditious
elements
in
this
country
and
in
india
since
these
have
frequently
been
referred
to
in
the
press
it
is
true
that
the
theosophical
society
like
the
grand
orient
disavows
all
political
intentions
and
professes
to
work
only
for
spiritual
development
but
the
leaders
appear
to
consider
that
a
radical
change
must
take
place
in
the
existing
social
system
before
true
spiritual
development
can
be
attained
that
this
change
would
lie
in
the
direction
of
socialism
is
suggested
by
the
fact
that
a
group
of
leading
theosophists
including
besant
were
discovered
in
to
be
holding
a
large
number
of
shares
in
the
victoria
house
printing
company
which
was
financing
the
at
that
date
indeed
besant
in
her
lectures
on
liberty
equality
fraternity
at
the
queen
hall
in
october
of
the
same
year
clearly
indicated
socialism
as
the
system
of
the
coming
new
era
since
then
the
action
lodge
has
been
founded
with
the
object
of
carrying
theosophical
ideals
and
conceptions
into
all
fields
of
human
activity
from
which
the
political
field
appears
not
to
be
excluded
since
this
lodge
has
been
known
to
with
the
promoters
of
a
political
meeting
on
the
indian
question
it
is
interesting
to
notice
that
a
leading
member
of
the
action
lodge
and
also
of
the
order
of
the
star
in
the
east
was
recently
reported
in
the
press
to
have
been
long
connected
with
the
labour
party
and
to
have
notified
her
intention
of
standing
for
it
in
parliament
this
is
of
course
not
to
say
that
all
theosophists
are
socialists
the
theosophical
society
of
america
in
an
admirable
series
of
articles
discussing
the
theory
of
set
forth
in
my
books
pointed
out
that
the
pupils
of
the
powers
of
evil
work
untiringly
to
thwart
every
real
advance
of
the
human
race
to
pull
down
whatever
civilization
painfully
builds
that
makes
for
light
and
true
development
and
spiritual
growth
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
suggest
reasons
why
these
pupils
and
of
the
powers
of
darkness
choose
the
chief
clauses
of
their
creed
internationalism
communism
the
destruction
of
the
higher
class
through
the
despotic
rule
of
the
lowest
class
the
corruption
of
family
life
the
attack
on
religion
hardly
needs
comment
it
will
be
seen
then
that
socialism
and
internationalism
are
not
an
essential
part
of
theosophical
teaching
and
that
the
more
enlightened
theosophists
recognize
the
danger
of
these
destructive
doctrines
at
a
special
convention
in
england
on
april
of
this
year
seven
lodges
entered
a
protest
against
recent
departures
from
the
original
policy
of
the
society
amongst
the
resolutions
put
forward
was
one
urging
the
president
besant
to
establish
a
tribunal
to
investigate
matters
affecting
the
good
name
of
the
society
and
the
conduct
of
certain
members
this
was
lost
by
an
overwhelming
majority
another
resolution
regretted
that
the
administration
the
magazine
and
the
influence
of
the
society
have
been
used
for
controversial
political
ends
and
sectarian
religious
propaganda
unhappily
these
resolutions
were
not
met
in
the
fraternal
spirit
that
might
be
expected
from
a
society
setting
out
to
establish
universal
brotherhood
and
were
stigmatized
in
a
proposed
amendment
as
destructive
motions
at
variance
with
the
objects
for
which
the
society
stands
this
clause
in
the
amendment
was
lost
by
a
small
majority
but
a
very
large
majority
supported
the
further
clauses
in
which
the
special
convention
affirmed
its
complete
confidence
in
the
administration
of
the
society
and
its
beloved
and
revered
president
annie
besant
the
chosen
leader
of
whom
it
is
justly
proud
and
sent
its
cordial
greetings
to
bishop
leadbeater
thanking
him
for
his
invaluable
work
and
his
unswerving
devotion
to
the
cause
of
theosophy
and
the
service
of
the
theosophical
society
there
are
then
a
certain
number
of
theosophists
in
this
country
who
have
the
courage
and
public
spirit
to
protest
against
the
use
of
the
society
for
political
ends
and
against
infractions
of
the
moral
code
which
they
believe
certain
members
to
have
committed
but
this
party
unfortunately
constitutes
only
a
small
minority
the
rest
are
prepared
to
render
blind
and
unquestioning
obedience
to
the
dictates
of
besant
and
leadbeater
in
this
respect
the
theosophical
society
follows
the
usual
plan
of
secret
societies
for
although
not
nominally
a
secret
society
it
is
one
in
effect
being
composed
of
outer
and
inner
circles
and
absolutely
controlled
by
supreme
directors
the
inner
circle
known
as
the
esoteric
section
or
rather
the
eastern
school
of
theosophy
usually
referred
to
as
the
is
in
reality
a
secret
society
consisting
in
its
turn
of
three
further
circles
the
innermost
composed
of
the
mahatmas
or
masters
of
the
white
lodge
the
second
of
the
accepted
pupils
or
initiates
and
the
third
of
the
learners
or
ordinary
members
the
and
thus
compose
two
secret
societies
within
the
open
order
controlled
by
people
who
are
frequently
members
of
both
whether
even
these
higher
initiates
are
really
in
the
secret
is
another
question
weller
van
hook
who
is
said
to
have
been
also
a
rosicrucian
and
an
important
member
of
the
grand
orient
once
cryptically
observed
that
theosophy
is
not
the
hierarchy
implying
that
it
was
only
part
of
a
and
darkly
hinting
that
if
it
did
not
carry
out
the
work
allotted
to
it
the
rosicrucians
would
take
control
that
this
is
more
than
probable
we
shall
see
later
the
outer
ranks
of
the
theosophical
society
seem
to
be
largely
composed
of
harmless
enthusiasts
who
imagine
that
they
are
receiving
genuine
instruction
in
the
religions
and
occult
doctrines
of
the
east
that
the
teaching
of
the
would
not
be
taken
seriously
by
any
real
orientalist
and
that
they
could
learn
far
more
by
studying
the
works
of
recognized
authorities
on
these
subjects
at
a
university
or
at
the
british
museum
does
not
occur
to
them
for
a
moment
nor
would
this
fulfil
the
purpose
of
the
leaders
for
the
theosophical
society
is
not
a
study
group
but
essentially
a
propagandist
society
which
aims
at
substituting
for
the
pure
and
simple
teaching
of
christianity
the
amazing
compound
of
eastern
superstition
cabalism
and
charlatanism
which
besant
and
her
coadjutors
have
devised
yet
even
were
the
doctrines
of
besant
those
of
true
buddhism
or
of
brahmanism
to
what
extent
are
they
likely
to
benefit
western
civilization
setting
the
question
of
christianity
aside
experience
shows
that
the
attempt
to
orientalize
occidentals
may
prove
no
less
disastrous
than
the
attempt
to
occidentalize
orientals
and
that
to
transport
eastern
mysticism
to
the
west
is
to
vulgarize
it
and
to
produce
a
debased
form
of
occultism
that
frequently
ends
in
moral
deterioration
or
mental
derangement
i
attribute
the
scandals
that
have
taken
place
amongst
theosophists
directly
to
this
cause
but
it
is
time
to
turn
to
another
society
in
which
this
debased
occultism
plays
a
still
more
important
part
rosicrucianism
at
the
present
time
as
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
term
rosicrucianism
is
used
to
cover
a
number
of
associations
differing
in
their
aims
and
doctrines
the
first
of
these
societies
to
be
founded
in
england
was
the
rosicruciana
in
founded
in
by
robert
wentworth
little
on
instructions
received
from
abroad
only
master
masons
are
admitted
a
procedure
not
condemned
by
grand
lodge
of
england
which
regards
the
as
a
perfectly
innocuous
body
although
neither
polical
nor
but
on
the
contrary
containing
distinctly
christian
elements
and
claiming
to
descend
from
christian
rosenkreutz
a
claim
which
must
be
dismissed
as
an
absurdity
the
is
nevertheless
largely
cabalistic
dealing
with
the
forces
of
nature
alchemy
etc
if
its
progenitors
are
really
to
be
traced
further
back
than
the
rosicrucians
of
the
nineteenth
century
ragon
eliphas
lévi
and
kenneth
mackenzie
they
must
be
sought
amongst
certain
esoteric
masons
in
hungary
and
also
amongst
the
french
martinistes
whose
rituals
doubtless
derived
from
a
kindred
source
it
will
be
remembered
that
marlines
pasqually
bequeathed
to
his
disciples
a
large
number
of
jewish
manuscripts
which
were
presumably
preserved
in
the
archives
of
the
martiniste
lodge
at
lyons
the
order
of
martinistes
has
never
ceased
to
exist
and
the
president
of
the
suprême
conseil
gérard
encausse
well
known
as
papus
an
avowed
cabalist
only
died
in
to
these
archives
another
famous
cabalist
the
renegade
abbé
alphonse
louis
constant
who
assumed
the
name
of
eliphas
lévi
may
well
have
had
access
it
is
said
that
one
of
eliphas
lévi
most
distinguished
disciples
the
occultist
baron
spedalieri
of
marseilles
was
a
member
of
the
grand
lodge
of
solitary
brethren
of
the
mountain
an
illumined
brother
of
the
ancient
restored
order
of
manicheans
a
high
member
of
the
grand
orient
and
also
a
high
illuminate
of
the
martinistes
before
his
death
in
eliphas
lévi
announced
that
in
a
new
political
and
religious
universal
kingdom
would
be
established
and
that
it
would
be
possessed
by
him
who
would
have
the
keys
of
the
east
the
manuscript
containing
this
prophecy
was
passed
on
by
baron
spedalieri
to
edward
maitland
who
in
his
turn
gave
it
to
a
leading
member
of
by
whom
it
was
published
in
english
but
as
we
have
already
seen
the
principal
centre
of
cabalism
was
in
eastern
europe
whilst
germany
was
the
principal
home
of
rosicrucianism
and
it
was
from
these
directions
that
a
few
years
later
a
new
rosicrucian
order
in
england
derived
its
inspiration
it
is
curious
to
notice
that
the
eighties
of
the
last
century
were
marked
by
a
simultaneous
recrudescence
of
secret
societies
and
of
socialist
organizations
in
leopold
engel
reorganized
weishaupt
order
of
illuminati
which
according
to
guénon
played
thenceforth
an
extremely
suspect
political
rôle
and
soon
after
this
in
it
is
said
that
a
strange
incident
took
place
in
london
the
rev
woodford
a
happened
to
be
turning
over
the
contents
of
a
bookstall
in
farringdon
street
when
he
came
upon
some
cypher
attached
to
which
was
a
letter
in
german
saying
that
if
the
finder
were
to
communicate
with
sapiens
dominabatur
astris
fraulein
anna
sprengel
in
germany
he
would
receive
further
interesting
information
this
at
any
rate
is
the
story
told
to
initiates
of
the
order
which
came
to
be
founded
according
to
the
instructions
given
in
the
cypher
but
when
we
remember
that
precisely
the
same
story
was
told
by
cagliostro
concerning
his
discovery
of
a
in
london
by
the
mysterious
george
cofton
on
which
he
had
founded
his
egyptian
rite
we
begin
to
wonder
whether
the
placing
of
a
in
a
spot
where
it
is
certain
to
be
discovered
by
precisely
the
people
qualified
to
decipher
it
forms
one
of
the
traditional
methods
of
adepts
for
extending
their
sphere
of
influence
without
betraying
their
identity
or
revealing
the
centre
of
direction
in
this
case
it
certainly
succeeded
admirably
for
by
a
fortunate
coincidence
the
clergyman
who
found
the
cypher
mss
was
acquainted
with
two
prominent
members
of
the
wynn
westcott
and
woodman
to
whom
he
took
the
documents
and
by
a
further
fortunate
coincidence
one
of
them
happened
to
be
the
very
person
to
whom
eliphas
lévi
prophecy
had
been
given
these
two
men
who
now
assumed
the
pseudonyms
of
sapere
aude
and
magnus
est
veritas
were
able
partially
to
decipher
the
manuscript
with
the
assistance
of
a
german
then
wrote
to
fraulein
anna
sprengel
saying
that
he
and
a
friend
had
finished
the
deciphering
and
that
they
desired
further
information
in
reply
they
were
told
to
elaborate
the
notes
and
that
if
diligent
they
would
be
allowed
to
form
an
elementary
branch
of
the
rosicrucian
order
in
england
finally
wrote
to
authorising
him
to
sign
her
or
his
name
to
any
warrant
or
document
necessary
for
the
constitution
of
an
order
and
promising
later
on
further
rituals
and
advanced
teachings
if
the
preliminary
order
proved
successful
and
now
called
in
the
aid
of
a
third
member
of
the
macgregor
mathers
henceforth
known
as
deo
duce
comite
ferro
who
having
more
time
at
his
disposal
was
able
by
means
of
long
and
arduous
labour
to
elaborate
the
rituals
in
masonic
style
on
march
a
warrant
was
then
drawn
up
according
to
the
design
given
in
the
cypher
mss
and
was
signed
by
for
by
and
all
three
having
received
the
honorary
grade
of
from
so
as
to
enable
them
to
act
as
chief
of
the
new
temple
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
whilst
the
instructions
in
the
cypher
mss
were
in
english
and
german
the
name
now
given
to
the
new
order
the
golden
dawn
was
accompanied
by
its
equivalent
in
hebrew
chebreth
zerech
aur
bokher
that
is
to
say
the
companions
of
the
rising
light
of
the
morning
amongst
the
instructions
we
find
avoid
roman
catholics
but
with
pity
also
these
directions
concerning
the
obligation
the
candidate
asking
for
light
is
taken
to
the
altar
and
forced
to
take
an
obligation
to
secrecy
under
penalty
of
expulsion
and
death
or
palsy
from
hostile
current
of
will
from
the
subsequent
correspondence
of
the
order
it
is
seen
that
this
punitive
current
was
actually
directed
by
the
chiefs
against
those
who
rebelled
although
the
members
of
the
golden
dawn
later
became
linked
up
with
the
esoteric
masons
in
germany
neither
the
organization
nor
the
ritual
of
the
order
are
masonic
but
rather
martiniste
and
cabalistic
for
amidst
all
the
confused
phraseology
of
the
order
the
phrases
and
symbols
borrowed
from
egyptian
greek
or
hindu
mythology
one
detects
the
real
basis
of
the
whole
system
the
jewish
cabala
in
which
all
the
three
chiefs
were
or
became
experts
mathers
in
fact
translated
the
famous
book
of
abraham
the
jew
from
french
into
english
with
explanatory
notes
and
wynn
westcott
translated
the
sepher
yetzirah
from
hebrew
lectures
were
given
to
the
society
on
such
subjects
as
the
tarot
cards
geomantic
talismans
and
the
schemhamphorasch
or
tetragrammaton
the
order
was
at
first
absolutely
governed
by
the
three
chiefs
but
after
a
time
owing
to
the
death
of
woodman
and
the
resignation
of
wynn
westcott
mathers
became
the
sole
chief
and
professed
to
have
obtained
further
instructions
from
the
hidden
chiefs
through
his
wife
a
sister
of
bergson
by
means
of
clairvoyance
and
clairaudience
but
the
real
directors
of
the
order
were
in
germany
and
known
as
the
hidden
and
secret
chiefs
of
the
third
order
a
curious
resemblance
will
here
be
noted
with
the
concealed
superiors
by
whom
members
of
the
in
the
eighteenth
century
declared
themselves
to
be
controlled
who
these
men
were
at
the
time
the
order
was
founded
remains
a
mystery
not
only
to
the
outside
world
but
even
to
the
english
initiates
themselves
the
identity
of
sapiens
dominabatur
astris
appears
never
to
have
been
established
nor
was
anything
more
heard
about
the
still
more
mysterious
anna
sprengel
until
her
death
in
an
obscure
german
village
was
reported
in
indeed
one
of
the
most
active
members
of
the
order
robert
felkin
known
as
finem
respice
later
declared
that
although
he
had
visited
five
temples
of
the
order
in
germany
and
austria
he
had
been
unable
to
get
into
touch
with
the
hidden
chiefs
or
to
discover
how
the
original
mss
came
into
the
hands
of
the
clergyman
who
handed
them
to
wynn
westcott
and
woodman
according
to
felkin
statement
all
that
he
had
been
able
to
find
out
was
that
the
mss
were
the
notes
of
ceremonies
made
by
a
man
who
had
been
initiated
into
a
lodge
in
germany
and
that
the
temple
from
which
they
originated
was
a
special
temple
working
on
the
cabala
tree
like
the
english
branch
of
the
order
further
he
was
told
that
none
of
the
big
three
who
founded
the
golden
dawn
in
england
were
real
rosicrucians
at
all
the
confusion
of
ideas
which
must
inevitably
result
when
as
in
secret
societies
or
revolutionary
organizations
a
number
of
people
are
being
blindly
led
by
hidden
directors
naturally
brought
about
dissensions
amongst
the
members
who
mutually
accused
each
other
of
ignorance
of
the
real
aims
of
the
order
thus
the
london
lodge
ended
by
breaking
with
mathers
who
was
in
paris
on
account
of
his
arrogance
in
claiming
supreme
power
through
the
mystery
of
the
hidden
chiefs
and
after
two
years
of
unsettled
government
in
elected
three
new
chiefs

respice
bullock
a
solicitor
levavi
oculos
who
resigned
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
brodie
innes
sub
spe
but
although
mathers
had
been
repudiated
his
teachings
were
retained
as
emanating
from
the
hidden
chiefs
two
years
earlier
a
dramatic
incident
had
occurred
in
a
very
sinister
personage
aleister
crowley
had
been
introduced
into
the
order
on
the
recommendation
of
waite
sacramentum
regis
the
mystical
writer
a
man
of
many
aliases
crowley
followed
the
precedent
of
the
comte
de
the
comte
de
cagliostro
and
the
baron
von
offenbach
by
ennobling
himself
and
masquerading
under
various
titles
in
turn
such
as
count
svareff
lord
boleskine
baron
rosenkreutz
but
usually
known
in
the
order
as
p
for
perdurabo
crowley
who
was
a
cabalist
had
written
a
book
on
goetic
magic
and
soon
after
becoming
a
member
of
the
golden
dawn
set
to
work
with
another
frater
on
magical
experiments
including
evocations
the
consecration
and
use
of
talismans
divination
alchemy
etc
in
crowley
had
joined
mathers
in
paris
where
the
latter
and
his
wife
were
living
under
the
assumed
names
of
the
comte
and
comtesse
of
glenstrae
and
engaged
in
reviving
the
mysteries
of
isis
at
the
bodinière
theatre
in
this
task
they
were
joined
by
an
extraordinary
lady
the
notorious
madame
horos
alias
the
swami
who
claimed
to
be
the
real
and
authentic
sapiens
dominabatur
astris
crowley
described
her
as
a
very
stout
woman
and
very
fair
and
a
vampire
of
remarkable
power
mathers
declared
her
to
be
probably
the
most
powerful
medium
living
but
later
in
a
letter
to
another
member
of
the
golden
dawn
observed
i
believe
her
and
her
accomplices
to
be
emissaries
of
a
very
powerful
occult
who
have
been
trying
for
years
to
break
up
other
orders
and
especially
my
work
incidentally
this
lady
who
proved
to
be
a
false
ended
by
starting
an
order
in
collaboration
with
her
husband
in
which
it
was
said
that
certain
rituals
of
the
golden
dawn
were
adapted
to
an
immoral
purpose
with
the
result
that
the
couple
were
brought
to
trial
and
finally
condemned
to
penal
servitude
whether
owing
to
this
disturbing
experience
or
because
as
crowley
declared
he
had
imprudently
attracted
to
himself
forces
of
evil
too
great
and
terrible
for
him
to
withstand
presumably
abramelin
demons
mathers
reason
began
to
totter
this
then
was
the
situation
at
the
time
of
his
rupture
with
the
order
and
the
dramatic
incident
referred
to
was
the
sudden
appearance
of
crowley
in
london
who
whether
acting
as
mathers
envoy
or
on
his
own
initiative
broke
into
the
premises
of
the
order
with
a
black
mask
over
his
face
a
plaid
shawl
thrown
over
his
shoulders
an
enormous
gold
or
gilt
cross
on
his
breast
and
a
dagger
at
his
side
for
the
purpose
of
taking
over
possession
this
attempt
was
baffled
with
the
prosaic
aid
of
the
police
and
crowley
was
expelled
from
the
order
eventually
however
he
succeeded
in
obtaining
possession
of
some
of
the
rituals
and
other
documents
of
the
golden
dawn
which
he
proceeded
to
publish
in
the
organ
of
a
new
order
of
his
own
this
magazine
containing
a
mixture
of
debased
cabalism
and
vulgar
blasphemies
interspersed
with
panegyrics
on
haschish
for
crowley
combined
with
sexual
perversion
an
addiction
to
drugs
which
might
appear
to
express
only
the
ravings
of
a
maniac
but
eccentricity
has
often
provided
the
best
cloak
for
dark
designs
and
the
outbreak
of
war
proved
that
there
was
a
method
in
the
madness
of
the
man
whom
the
authorities
persisted
in
regarding
merely
as
an
irresponsible
degenerate
of
a
kind
to
quote
the
press
report
of
his
exploits
after
this
date
in
november
crowley
went
to
the
united
states
where
he
entered
into
close
relations
with
the
propagandists
he
edited
the
new
york
a
german
propagandist
paper
run
by
the
notorious
george
silvester
viereck
and
published
among
other
things
an
obscene
attack
on
the
king
and
a
glorification
of
the
kaiser
crowley
ran
occultism
as
a
and
seems
to
have
been
known
as
the
purple
priest
later
on
he
publicly
destroyed
his
british
passport
before
the
statute
of
liberty
declared
in
favour
of
the
irish
republican
cause
and
made
a
theatrical
declaration
of
war
on
england
during
his
stay
in
america
crowley
was
associated
with
a
body
known
as
the
secret
revolutionary
committee
which
was
working
for
the
establishment
of
an
irish
republic
he
is
known
also
as
the
writer
of
a
defeatest
manifesto
circulated
in
france
in
but
to
return
to
the
golden
dawn
in
a
split
occurred
in
the
order
waite
an
early
member
of
it
seceded
from
it
with
a
number
of
other
members
and
carried
off
with
him
the
name
of
golden
dawn
also
the
vault
and
other
property
of
the
order
the
original
order
then
took
the
name
of
stella
matutina
with
felkin
as
chief
in
the
preceding
year
the
members
of
the
london
lodge
had
again
believed
that
they
were
in
touch
with
the
third
and
revived
their
efforts
to
communicate
with
the
secret
chiefs
in
germany
this
state
of
uncertainty
continued
till
about
when
felkin
and
meakin
set
forth
for
germany
where
they
succeeded
in
meeting
several
members
of
the
third
order
who
professed
to
be
true
and
genuine
rosicrucians
and
to
know
of
anna
sprengel
and
the
starting
of
the
order
in
england
they
were
not
it
was
believed
the
secret
and
hidden
chiefs
but
more
probably
esoteric
masons
of
the
grand
orient
these
fratres
however
told
them
that
in
order
to
form
a
definite
etheric
link
between
themselves
and
the
order
in
great
britain
it
would
be
necessary
for
a
british
frater
to
be
under
their
instruction
for
a
year
accordingly
meakin
remained
in
germany
for
special
training
so
that
he
might
act
as
the
etheric
link
between
the
two
countries
after
a
pilgrimage
to
the
near
east
closely
following
the
itinerary
of
christian
rosenkreutz
meakin
returned
to
germany
and
it
appears
to
have
been
now
that
he
was
able
to
get
into
touch
with
a
certain
high
adept
of
occult
science
this
remarkable
personage
rudolf
steiner
had
earlier
belonged
to
the
theosophical
society
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
at
some
period
he
may
have
been
connected
with
the
revived
illuminati
of
leopold
engel
there
is
certainly
some
reason
to
believe
that
at
one
point
in
his
career
he
came
into
touch
with
men
who
were
carrying
on
the
teachings
of
weishaupt
the
chief
of
whom
was
the
president
of
a
group
of
secret
societies
and
it
seems
not
improbable
that
the
mysterious
under
whose
directions
the
golden
dawn
was
founded
might
be
located
in
this
circle
a
few
years
before
the
war
steiner
whilst
still
a
theosophist
started
a
society
of
his
own
the
anthroposophical
society
a
name
borrowed
from
the
work
of
the
xviith
century
rosicrucian
thomas
vaughan
anthroposophica
magica
the
ostensible
leader
of
rosicrucianism
in
germany
was
franz
hartmann
founder
of
the
order
of
the
esoteric
rose
croix
although
in
some
way
connected
with
engel
illuminati
and
more
definitely
with
the
theosophical
society
hartmann
was
believed
to
be
a
genuine
christian
mystic
steiner
also
made
the
same
profession
and
it
seems
probable
that
he
formed
one
of
the
group
of
mysterious
personages
including
besides
grand
orient
masons
baron
von
knigge
great
grandson
of
weishaupt
coadjutor
philo
who
met
together
in
secret
conference
at
ingoldstadt
where
the
first
lodge
of
the
illuminati
had
been
founded
in
and
decided
to
revive
illuminism
on
christian
mystic
lines
used
in
a
very
elastic
sense
amongst
occultists
at
the
same
time
steiner
introduces
into
his
teaching
a
strong
vein
of
gnosticism
luciferianism
johannism
and
grand
orient
masonry
whilst
reserving
rosicrucianism
for
his
higher
initiates
on
this
last
point
he
is
extremely
reticent
preferring
to
call
his
teaching
occult
science
since
he
recognizes
that
real
rosicrucians
never
proclaim
themselves
as
such
it
is
therefore
only
in
the
inner
circle
of
his
society
on
which
no
information
is
given
to
the
public
and
into
which
members
are
admitted
by
much
the
same
forms
of
initiation
as
those
used
by
the
grand
orient
that
rosicrucianism
is
mentioned
some
of
steiner
imitators
in
the
rosicrucian
fellowship
at
oceanside
california
however
openly
profess
what
they
call
rosicrucianism
and
at
the
same
time
claim
superior
knowledge
on
the
subject
of
masonry
thus
in
a
book
by
the
leader
of
this
group
we
find
it
solemnly
stated
that
according
to
max
heindl
eve
cohabited
with
serpents
in
the
garden
of
eden
that
cain
was
the
offspring
of
her
union
with
the
lucifer
spirit
samael
and
that
from
this
divine
progenitor
the
most
virile
portion
of
the
human
race
descended
the
rest
being
merely
the
progeny
of
human
parents
readers
of
the
present
work
will
recognize
this
as
not
the
legend
of
masonry
but
of
the
jewish
cabala
which
has
been
already
quoted
in
this
context
whether
this
also
forms
part
of
steiner
teaching
it
is
impossible
to
say
since
his
real
doctrines
are
known
only
to
his
inner
circle
even
some
of
his
admirers
amongst
the
steiner
matutina
whilst
consulting
him
as
an
oracle
are
not
admitted
to
the
secrets
of
his
grades
of
initiation
and
have
been
unable
to
succeed
in
obtaining
from
him
a
charter
meanwhile
they
themselves
do
not
disclose
to
the
neophytes
whom
they
seek
to
win
over
that
they
are
members
of
any
secret
association
this
is
quite
in
accordance
with
the
methods
of
weishaupt
insinuating
brothers
the
result
of
what
steiner
calls
occult
science
is
thus
described
in
a
striking
passage
of
one
of
his
own
works
this
is
the
change
which
the
occult
student
observes
coming
over
himself
that
there
is
no
longer
a
connection
between
a
thought
and
a
feeling
or
a
feeling
and
a
volition
except
when
he
creates
the
connection
himself
no
impulse
drives
him
from
thought
to
action
if
he
does
not
voluntarily
harbour
it
he
can
now
stand
completely
without
feeling
before
an
object
which
before
his
training
would
have
filled
him
with
glowing
love
or
violent
hatred
he
can
likewise
remain
actionless
before
a
thought
which
heretofore
would
have
spurred
him
to
action
as
if
by
itself
etc
i
can
imagine
no
clearer
exposé
of
the
dangers
of
occultism
than
this
weishaupt
had
said
i
can
not
use
men
as
i
find
them
i
must
form
them
steiner
shows
how
this
transformation
can
be
accomplished
under
the
influence
of
occult
training
which
is
in
reality
simply
powerful
suggestion
all
a
man
native
impulses
and
inhibitive
springs
of
action
may
be
broken
the
pupil
of
the
occultist
will
no
longer
react
to
the
conceptions
of
beauty
or
ugliness
of
right
or
wrong
which
unknown
to
himself
formed
the
law
of
his
being
thus
not
only
his
conscious
deeds
but
his
processes
pass
under
the
control
of
another
if
this
is
indeed
the
method
employed
by
steiner
and
his
adepts
there
would
certainly
seem
to
be
some
justification
for
the
verdict
of
robert
kuentz
that
steiner
has
devised
occult
exercises
which
render
the
mind
incapable
rendent
anéanti
that
he
attacks
the
individual
by
deranging
his
faculties
il
détraque
les
facultés
what
is
the
real
motive
power
behind
such
societies
as
the
stella
matutina
and
again
behind
steiner
this
remains
a
mystery
not
only
to
the
outside
world
but
to
the
initiates
themselves
the
quest
of
the
hidden
chiefs
undertaken
by
one
intrepid
pilgrim
after
another
seems
to
have
ended
only
in
further
meetings
with
steiner
yet
hope
springs
eternal
in
the
breast
of
the
aspirant
after
occult
knowledge
and
astral
messages
spurred
the
fratres
to
further
efforts
one
of
these
contained
the
exhortation
go
on
with
steiner
which
is
not
the
ultimate
end
of
search
and
we
will
come
into
contact
with
many
serious
students
who
will
lead
us
to
the
real
master
of
the
order
who
will
be
so
overpoweringly
impressive
as
to
leave
no
room
for
doubt
a
curious
analogy
with
will
here
be
observed
for
whilst
the
veiled
picture
of
the
lodges
is
said
to
represent
the
master
in
the
person
of
ragocsky
or
some
other
personage
in
austria
or
hungary
so
it
is
likewise
in
austria
and
germany
that
the
members
of
stella
matutina
seek
their
hidden
chiefs
and
the
real
master
of
their
order
moreover
whilst
the
await
the
coming
of
the
great
world
teacher
king
or
messiah
in
it
is
also
in
that
the
stella
matutina
expect
christian
rosenkreutz
to
appear
again
there
are
many
other
points
of
resemblance
between
the
phraseology
of
the
two
orders
as
for
example
the
idea
of
the
astral
light
the
great
white
lodge
and
also
the
great
work
by
which
both
orders
denote
the
supreme
object
of
their
aspirations
the
union
of
the
east
and
the
west
it
is
therefore
impossible
not
to
suspect
that
although
the
members
of
and
of
the
stella
matutina
imagine
their
respective
orders
to
be
entirely
unconnected
and
indeed
appear
to
be
hardly
aware
of
each
other
existence
there
may
be
nevertheless
some
point
of
junction
in
the
background
and
even
a
common
centre
of
direction
in
this
connexion
it
is
interesting
to
notice
the
political
tendencies
of
the
societies
in
question
although
the
outcome
of
the
and
nominally
under
the
jurisdiction
of
headquarters
in
paris
does
not
appear
to
be
in
its
sympathies
on
the
contrary
the
lodges
in
this
country
as
also
the
head
lodge
in
the
rue
seem
to
have
adopted
that
form
of
universal
brotherhood
which
principally
redounds
to
the
benefit
of
germany
the
stella
matutina
whilst
professing
to
be
solely
concerned
in
occult
science
and
warning
its
members
against
on
account
of
the
political
tendencies
of
the
latter
is
nevertheless
still
more
imbued
with
german
influence
since
as
we
have
seen
it
has
ever
since
it
first
came
into
existence
been
secretly
under
germany
direction
indeed
during
the
war
this
influence
became
so
apparent
that
certain
patriotic
members
who
had
entered
the
society
in
all
good
faith
with
the
idea
of
studying
occult
science
raised
an
energetic
protest
and
a
schism
took
place
thus
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
more
recognized
the
imprudence
of
placing
themselves
under
foreign
control
that
this
was
no
imaginary
danger
is
shown
by
a
correspondence
which
had
taken
place
some
years
earlier
and
has
recently
been
brought
to
light
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
great
aim
of
weishaupt
and
the
illuminati
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
to
obtain
control
over
all
existing
masonic
and
occult
orders
this
also
became
the
dream
of
rudolf
steiner
and
his
allies
in
other
countries
whose
plan
was
to
form
what
they
called
an
international
bund
the
idea
of
an
international
bureau
for
masonic
affairs
had
already
as
we
have
seen
been
started
in
switzerland
this
was
the
same
idea
applied
to
occult
groups
so
that
all
such
societies
as
rosicrucianism
theosophy
with
its
various
ramifications
of
hermetic
orders
isolated
occultists
and
so
on
were
to
be
placed
under
german
control
the
audacity
of
the
proposal
seems
to
have
been
too
much
even
for
some
of
the
most
internationally
minded
members
of
the
stella
matutina
and
in
the
discussion
that
took
place
it
was
pointed
out
that
admirable
as
the
scheme
might
be
there
was
nevertheless
some
british
spirit
amongst
these
orders
to
be
reckoned
with
even
besant
followers
headed
by
the
described
as
a
group
which
attracts
a
large
number
of
idle
women
who
have
leisure
to
take
a
little
occultism
with
their
afternoon
tea
might
be
liable
to
ask
who
are
these
germans
to
interfere
but
the
real
obstacle
to
success
was
held
to
be
british
freemasonry
to
which
a
certain
number
of
students
of
occult
science
including
all
the
members
of
the
belonged
english
masonry
it
was
remarked
boasts
the
grand
lodge
of
the
mother
lodge
of
the
world
they
are
a
proud
jealous
autocratic
body
derives
from
the
grand
orient
of
france
an
illegitimate
body
according
to
english
ruling
no
english
mason
can
work
with
if
the
english
grand
lodge
hears
of
anything
called
masonry
derived
from
such
sources
under
chiefs
once
theosophical
society
members
under
a
head
in
berlin
it
will
not
enquire
who
steiner
is
or
what
is
the
nature
of
his
work
it
will
simply
say
english
masons
of
the
free
and
accepted
masons
may
join
any
society
working
rites
no
one
of
ordinary
accepted
freemasonry
can
attend
any
meetings
or
attend
any
grades
in
this
illegitimate
body
finis
if
a
lodge
of
the
continental
order
is
to
be
established
in
england
steiner
will
be
faced
with
the
masonic
difficulty
this
is
really
serious
here
then
is
one
of
the
finest
tributes
ever
paid
to
british
masonry
for
it
shows
that
as
at
present
constituted
and
controlled
it
provides
the
most
formidable
barrier
against
the
infiltration
of
this
country
by
alien
or
subversive
secret
societies
thus
the
freemasons
and
the
roman
catholics
are
recognized
as
the
principal
obstacles
to
success
the
freemasons
however
would
do
well
to
realize
the
attempts
that
are
made
to
break
down
this
resistance
by
traitors
in
the
masonic
camp
who
after
violating
their
obligations
by
belonging
to
an
irregular
secret
society
act
as
recruiting
agents
in
the
lodges
for
the
author
of
these
remarks
was
a
british
freemason
who
in
collusion
with
a
foreign
adept
proposed
to
penetrate
freemasonry
by
the
process
known
in
revolutionary
language
as
boring
from
within
to
quote
his
own
words
must
be
got
at
from
within
not
from
this
was
to
be
accomplished
in
various
ways
by
adepts
of
the
continental
order
getting
themselves
initiated
into
orthodox
masonry
and
then
spreading
their
own
doctrines
in
the
lodges
or
by
enlisting
recruits
amongst
orthodox
masons
and
using
them
as
propagandists
among
their
it
was
also
suggested
that
in
order
not
to
rouse
suspicion
it
would
be
better
to
avoid
the
name
esoteric
masonry
to
adopt
one
of
the
rituals
used
in
england
and
to
employ
as
officers
a
mixed
group
drawn
from
various
secret
societies
this
plan
has
been
carried
out
with
considerable
success
and
at
a
recent
conference
held
by
a
high
continental
adept
under
the
most
distinguished
patronage
it
was
interesting
to
notice
the
various
secret
societies
represented
by
certain
of
the
promoters
who
of
course
to
the
general
public
appeared
to
be
merely
isolated
individuals
interested
in
philosophical
speculation
but
it
is
time
to
pass
on
to
the
question
of
yet
another
secret
association
for
amongst
those
present
at
the
conference
referred
to
were
members
of
the
group
clarté
this
society
of
which
the
name
as
well
as
its
avowed
aims
are
singularly
reminiscent
of
illuminism
was
first
heard
of
in
france
and
was
led
by
men
who
carried
on
active
propaganda
throughout
the
war
amongst
these
was
henri
barbusse
author
of
a
defeatest
novel
which
was
received
with
acclamations
from
illuminated
reviewers
in
the
press
of
this
country
yet
although
outwardly
a
french
organization
the
real
inspiration
and
teaching
of
is
essentially
and
a
great
number
of
jews
are
to
be
found
amongst
its
members
particularly
in
central
europe
at
the
inaugural
meeting
of
the
austrian
group
it
was
stated
that
per
cent
of
those
present
were
of
the
jewish
race
the
keynote
of
is
internationalism
abolition
of
nationality
destruction
of
frontiers
and
pacifism
or
rather
the
substitution
of
class
warfare
for
war
between
nations
for
this
purpose
it
is
willing
to
make
use
of
all
subversive
doctrines
to
whatever
school
of
thought
they
may
belong
hence
although
the
creed
of
the
leaders
is
professedly
socialism
they
readily
with
syndicalists
anarchists
or
revolutionaries
of
any
brand
carrying
on
propaganda
in
trade
unions
and
various
organizations
some
are
secretly
in
the
ranks
of
the
communists
in
fact
members
of
have
succeeded
in
penetrating
into
almost
every
subversive
group
even
as
far
afield
as
new
zealand
where
the
society
has
an
agency
in
wellington
and
disseminates
the
most
violent
revolutionary
teaching
and
literature
but
whilst
thus
making
use
of
the
proletariat
to
further
its
ends
the
point
of
view
of
is
fundamentally
undemocratic
for
the
real
grievances
of
the
workers
it
has
no
use
at
all
the
plan
of
this
group
who
were
recently
described
in
the
french
press
as
the
finest
specimens
of
cannibals
smeared
with
humanitarianism
les
plus
beaux
spécimens
de
cannibales
barbouillés
is
to
constitute
a
sort
of
international
hierarchy
of
intellectual
socialists
whose
influence
is
to
make
itself
invisibly
felt
in
literary
educational
and
artistic
circles
all
over
the
world
for
the
members
of
are
as
careful
as
were
the
adepts
of
weishaupt
to
preserve
their
incognito
and
not
to
be
known
as
illuminati
thus
the
public
in
our
own
country
and
elsewhere
reading
the
diatribes
of
certain
authors
against
the
existing
order
of
society
may
vaguely
wonder
why
men
living
amidst
all
the
amenities
of
civilization
should
desire
its
destruction
but
do
not
dream
that
all
this
is
not
the
outcome
of
an
individual
brain
but
propaganda
put
out
by
a
company
which
having
largely
primed
such
writers
with
ideas
is
able
owing
to
the
high
position
of
many
of
its
leading
members
and
its
influence
with
the
literary
world
to
ensure
the
success
of
any
publication
that
will
further
its
ends
the
organization
of
thus
approximates
more
nearly
to
the
system
of
weishaupt
than
that
of
the
other
societies
described
in
this
chapter
although
in
the
strictest
sense
a
secret
society
it
is
in
no
sense
occult
and
therefore
possesses
no
ritual
of
its
own
but
like
the
earlier
illuminati
recognizes
the
utility
of
working
through
freemasonry
in
fact
forms
an
adjunct
of
the
grand
orient
and
owns
a
lodge
under
its
jurisdiction
in
paris
it
would
be
interesting
however
to
know
whether
the
idea
of
the
alliance
with
the
grand
orient
occurred
as
an
afterthought
to
the
group
or
whether
the
original
inspiration
of
emanated
from
an
inner
circle
of
the
grand
orient
we
shall
return
to
the
question
of
this
inner
circle
in
a
later
chapter
such
then
are
the
principal
secret
societies
at
work
in
great
britain
but
amongst
minor
secret
or
movements
may
be
mentioned
the
strange
sect
the
faithists
said
to
have
some
affinity
with
the
druses
inhabiting
a
singularly
unromantic
london
suburb
whose
ancient
founder
is
the
author
of
a
series
of
tracts
urging
man
not
to
be
misled
by
false
gods
but
to
worship
jehovih
the
creator
only
and
at
the
same
time
advocating
nationalization
as
a
cure
for
all
social
ills
or
again
the
institute
for
the
harmonious
development
of
man
at
fontainebleau
led
by
gurdjieff
and
uspenski
which
combines
esoteric
meditation
with
an
extremely
meagre
diet
and
strenuous
manual
labour
it
is
interesting
by
the
way
to
notice
that
the
art
of
movement
known
as
eurhythmy
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
system
of
dalcroze
which
is
known
in
england
only
as
eurhythmics
forms
an
important
part
of
the
curriculum
of
the
last
society
as
also
of
herr
steiner
order
of
the
stella
matutina
and
of
the
russian
bolsheviks
the
one
question
that
presents
itself
to
the
judicial
mind
after
examining
all
these
movements
is
inevitably
are
they
of
any
real
importance
can
a
few
hundreds
or
even
thousands
of
men
and
women
drawn
largely
by
curiosity
or
want
of
occupation
into
societies
of
which
the
very
names
are
hardly
known
to
the
general
public
exercise
any
influence
on
the
world
at
large
it
would
certainly
be
an
error
to
overestimate
the
power
that
each
of
these
societies
individually
can
wield
to
do
so
would
be
in
fact
to
play
into
the
hands
of
the
leaders
whose
plan
from
weishaupt
onwards
has
always
been
to
represent
themselves
as
directing
the
destinies
of
the
universe
this
claim
to
power
is
the
bait
laid
for
neophytes
who
are
made
to
believe
that
the
order
will
one
day
rule
the
world
but
whilst
recognizing
the
folly
of
this
pretension
we
should
be
mistaken
in
underrating
their
importance
for
the
reason
that
they
provide
evidence
of
a
larger
organization
in
the
background
the
stella
matutina
may
be
only
an
obscure
fraternity
even
the
theosophical
society
with
all
its
ramifications
may
not
be
of
great
importance
in
itself
but
will
anyone
with
a
knowledge
of
european
affairs
seriously
maintain
that
the
grand
orient
is
a
small
or
unimportant
organization
and
have
we
not
seen
that
investigations
into
the
smaller
secret
societies
frequently
lead
back
to
this
greater
masonic
power
secret
societies
are
of
importance
because
they
are
moreover
symptomatic
and
also
because
although
the
work
actually
carried
out
in
their
lodges
or
councils
may
be
of
a
trivial
character
they
are
able
by
the
power
of
association
and
the
collective
force
they
generate
to
influence
public
opinion
and
to
float
ideas
in
the
outside
world
which
may
have
consequences
at
any
rate
the
fact
that
they
exist
finally
disposes
of
the
contention
that
secret
societies
of
a
subversive
and
even
of
an
abominable
kind
are
things
of
the
past
these
amazing
cults
these
strange
perverted
rites
which
we
associate
with
the
dark
ages
are
going
on
around
us
illuminism
cabalism
and
even
satanism
are
still
realities
in
monsieur
copin
albancelli
stated
that
circumstances
had
afforded
him
the
proof
that
certain
masonic
societies
exist
which
are
satanic
not
in
the
sense
that
the
devil
comes
to
preside
at
their
meetings
as
that
romancer
of
a
leo
taxil
pretended
but
in
that
their
initiates
profess
the
cult
of
lucifer
they
adore
him
as
the
true
god
and
they
are
animated
by
an
implacable
hatred
against
the
christian
god
whom
they
declare
to
be
an
impostor
they
have
a
formula
which
sums
up
their
state
of
mind
it
is
no
longer
to
the
glory
of
the
great
architect
of
the
universe
as
in
the
two
lower
masonries
it
is
which
means
gloire
et
amour
à
lucifer
haine
haine
haine
an
dieu
maudit
maudit
maudit
glory
and
love
for
lucifer
hatred
hatred
hatred
to
god
accursed
accursed
accursed
it
is
professed
in
these
societies
that
all
that
the
christian
god
commands
is
disagreeable
to
lucifer
that
all
that
he
forbids
is
on
the
contrary
agreeable
to
lucifer
that
in
consequence
one
must
do
all
that
the
christian
god
forbids
and
that
one
must
shun
like
fire
all
that
he
commands
i
repeat
that
with
regard
to
all
that
i
have
the
proofs
under
my
hand
i
have
read
and
studied
hundreds
of
documents
relating
to
one
of
these
societies
documents
that
i
have
not
permission
to
publish
and
which
emanate
from
the
members
men
and
women
of
the
group
in
question
i
do
not
say
that
any
society
in
england
consciously
practices
this
cult
of
satan
but
i
too
have
seen
dozens
of
documents
relating
to
occult
groups
in
this
country
which
practise
rites
and
evocations
that
lead
to
illness
moral
perversion
mental
derangement
and
even
in
some
cases
to
death
i
have
heard
from
the
lips
of
initiates
themselves
accounts
of
the
terrible
experiences
through
which
they
have
passed
some
have
even
urged
me
to
bring
the
matter
before
the
attention
of
the
authorities
but
unfortunately
no
department
exists
for
the
investigation
of
subversive
movements
yet
since
all
these
movements
are
intimately
connected
with
revolutionary
agitation
they
are
well
worth
the
attention
of
governments
that
desire
to
protect
law
order
and
public
morality
the
fact
is
that
the
very
extravagance
of
their
doctrines
and
practices
seems
to
ensure
their
immunity
nevertheless
whether
the
power
at
work
behind
them
is
of
the
kind
we
are
accustomed
to
call
supernatural
or
whether
it
is
merely
the
outcome
of
the
human
mind
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
its
potency
for
evil
and
of
its
very
definite
effects
in
the
obliteration
of
all
sense
of
truth
and
in
sexual
perversion
in
the
opinion
of
an
initiate
who
belonged
for
years
to
the
stella
matutina
the
dynamic
force
employed
known
as
kundalini
is
simply
an
force
of
which
the
is
a
part
on
which
the
adepts
know
how
to
play
and
the
unseen
hand
behind
all
the
seeming
spiritism
of
these
orders
is
a
system
of
very
subtle
and
cunning
hypnotism
and
suggestion
further
the
aim
of
this
group
like
that
of
all
subversive
esoteric
orders
is
by
means
of
such
processes
as
eurhythmics
meditations
symbols
ceremonies
and
formulas
to
awaken
this
force
and
produce
false
illumination
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
spiritual
seership
which
is
at
most
clairvoyance
clairaudience
etc
the
ceremonies
of
the
order
are
hypnotic
and
by
suggestion
create
the
necessary
mental
and
astral
atmosphere
hypnotize
and
prepare
the
members
to
be
the
willing
tools
in
the
hands
of
the
controlling
adepts
the
same
initiate
has
communicated
to
me
the
following
conclusions
concerning
the
group
in
question
with
the
permission
to
quote
them
verbatim
i
have
been
convinced
that
we
as
an
order
have
come
under
the
power
of
some
very
evil
occult
order
profoundly
versed
in
science
both
occult
and
otherwise
though
not
infallible
their
methods
being
black
magic
that
is
to
say
power
hypnotism
and
powerful
suggestion
we
are
convinced
that
the
order
is
being
controlled
by
some
sun
order
after
the
nature
of
the
illuminati
if
not
by
that
order
itself
the
reason
why
they
the
leaders
of
all
such
orders
insisted
so
much
upon
the
church
and
sacrament
especially
before
the
initiation
is
i
think
for
the
same
reason
as
the
use
of
the
consecrated
host
in
black
magic
the
christian
consecration
and
the
use
of
the
sacraments
renders
the
building
or
person
more
powerful
as
a
material
basis
for
black
magic
even
as
in
white
magic
for
the
great
good
or
the
great
evil
when
the
initiation
is
accomplished
and
the
domination
of
the
person
complete
there
is
no
further
need
for
church
or
sacrament
we
are
told
at
the
initiation
there
is
nothing
incompatible
with
your
civil
moral
or
religious
duties
in
this
obligation
we
now
are
convinced
that
this
order
is
contrary
absolutely
to
our
civil
moral
and
religious
duties
which
being
so
our
obligations
are
null
and
void
we
are
told
that
all
that
has
taken
place
in
russia
and
elsewhere
is
due
to
these
international
occult
forces
set
in
motion
by
subversive
esoteric
lodges
yet
it
is
known
that
we
have
several
branches
of
these
same
esoteric
masonic
lodges
carrying
on
their
deadly
work
in
our
midst
england
as
well
as
europe
seems
to
be
drifting
along
in
a
hypnotic
sleep
and
even
our
soundest
politicians
seem
paralysed
and
all
that
they
attempt
is
turned
to
foolishness
is
there
no
one
in
authority
who
understands
these
things
and
realizes
the
danger
both
to
the
country
and
to
individuals
from
these
forces
working
for
disruption
and
world
revolution
how
in
the
face
of
these
declarations
coming
from
those
inside
the
movement
can
anyone
maintain
that
illuminism
is
dead
and
that
secret
societies
present
no
danger
to
christian
civilization
open
subversive
movements
although
the
sceptical
reader
who
has
reached
this
stage
of
the
present
work
will
perhaps
be
willing
to
admit
that
some
connexion
may
be
traced
between
hidden
forces
and
open
subversive
movements
the
objection
he
will
still
raise
against
the
general
thesis
here
set
forth
will
probably
be
expressed
somewhat
in
the
following
manner
it
is
quite
possible
that
secret
societies
and
other
unseen
agencies
may
have
played
a
part
in
revolutions
but
to
attribute
the
continued
revolt
against
the
existing
social
order
to
these
causes
is
absurd
poverty
unemployment
inadequate
housing
and
above
all
the
inequalities
of
human
life
are
quite
sufficient
to
produce
a
revolutionary
spirit
without
the
aid
of
secret
instigators
social
revolution
is
simply
a
rising
of
the
against
the
and
requires
no
further
cause
to
explain
it
let
it
be
at
once
admitted
that
the
injustices
here
enumerated
are
real
the
working
classes
throughout
the
nineteenth
century
had
very
genuine
reasons
for
complaints
wages
were
far
too
low
the
rich
sometimes
showed
themselves
indifferent
to
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
employers
of
labour
often
made
profits
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
remuneration
paid
to
the
workers
nor
in
spite
of
the
immense
reforms
introduced
during
the
last
hundred
years
have
all
these
grievances
been
redressed
the
slums
of
our
great
cities
still
constitute
a
blot
upon
our
civilization
profiteering
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
has
been
more
flagrant
than
ever
rings
and
combines
provide
fabulous
wealth
for
individuals
or
groups
at
the
expense
of
vast
numbers
of
consumers
and
in
all
classes
of
the
community
just
as
before
the
french
revolution
people
feast
and
dance
whilst
others
live
on
the
of
starvation
but
let
us
see
how
far
the
socialist
movement
can
be
regarded
as
the
spontaneous
revolt
of
the
people
against
this
condition
of
things
dividing
the
people
after
the
manner
of
marx
into
the
and
the
revolutionary
proletariat
we
shall
find
that
the
former
category
by
far
the
larger
combines
with
a
strong
respect
for
tradition
a
perfectly
reasonable
desire
for
social
reform
briefly
it
asks
for
adequate
wages
decent
housing
and
a
fair
share
of
the
good
things
of
life
for
state
interference
in
the
affairs
of
everyday
life
it
feels
nothing
but
abhorrence
the
ideal
of
communism
as
formulated
by
lenin
wherein
the
getting
of
food
and
clothing
shall
be
no
longer
a
private
affair
would
meet
with
stronger
opposition
from
working
men
and
still
more
from
working
women
to
whom
shopping
is
as
the
breath
of
life
than
from
any
other
section
of
the
population
even
such
apparently
benign
socialist
schemes
as
communal
or
communal
kitchens
appeal
less
to
the
mentality
than
to
the
mind
that
devises
them
turning
to
the
revolutionary
proletariat
we
shall
find
this
individualistic
instinct
quite
as
strongly
developed
it
is
not
the
socialist
idea
of
placing
all
wealth
and
property
in
the
hands
of
the
state
but
the
anarchist
plan
of
expropriation
of
plunder
on
a
gigantic
scale
for
the
benefit
of
the
revolutionary
masses
which
really
appeals
to
the
disgruntled
portion
of
the
proletariat
the
socialist
intellectual
may
write
of
the
beauties
of
nationalization
of
the
joy
of
working
for
the
common
good
without
hope
of
personal
gain
the
revolutinary
working
man
sees
nothing
to
attract
him
in
all
this
question
him
on
his
ideas
of
social
transformation
and
he
will
generally
express
himself
in
favour
of
some
method
by
which
he
will
acquire
something
he
has
not
got
he
does
not
want
to
see
the
rich
socialized
by
the
state
he
wants
to
drive
about
in
it
himself
the
revolutionary
working
man
is
thus
in
reality
not
a
socialist
but
an
anarchist
at
heart
nor
in
some
cases
is
this
unnatural
that
the
man
who
enjoys
none
of
the
good
things
of
life
should
wish
to
snatch
his
share
must
at
least
appear
comprehensible
what
is
not
comprehensible
is
that
he
should
wish
to
renounce
all
hope
of
ever
possessing
anything
modern
socialist
propagandists
are
very
well
aware
of
this
attitude
of
the
working
classes
towards
their
schemes
and
therefore
that
as
long
as
they
explain
the
real
programme
they
mean
to
put
into
operation
which
is
nothing
but
the
workhouse
system
on
a
gigantic
scale
they
can
meet
with
no
success
as
a
socialist
has
frequently
observed
to
me
socialism
has
never
been
a
movement
it
was
always
we
of
the
middle
or
upper
classes
who
sought
to
instil
the
principles
of
socialism
into
the
minds
of
working
men
hyndman
candid
confessions
of
the
failures
to
enlist
the
sympathies
even
of
in
his
schemes
of
social
regeneration
bear
out
this
testimony
less
honest
socialist
orators
as
the
result
of
long
experience
have
therefore
adopted
the
more
effectual
policy
of
appealing
to
the
predatory
instincts
of
the
crowd
from
babeuf
onwards
socialism
has
only
been
able
to
make
headway
by
borrowing
the
language
of
anarchy
in
order
to
blast
its
way
to
power
socialism
is
thus
essentially
a
system
of
deception
devised
by
theorists
and
in
no
sense
a
popular
creed
had
the
revolutionary
movement
of
the
past
years
really
proceeded
from
the
people
it
would
inevitably
have
followed
the
line
laid
down
by
one
of
the
two
sections
of
the
proletariat
indicated
above
that
is
to
say
it
would
either
have
taken
the
form
of
a
continuous
and
increasing
agitation
for
social
reforms
which
would
have
enlisted
the
sympathy
of
all
men
and
must
therefore
in
the
end
have
proved
irresistible
or
it
would
have
followed
the
line
of
anarchy
organizing
brigandage
on
a
larger
and
yet
larger
scale
until
all
owners
of
wealth
having
been
exterminated
and
their
expropriators
in
their
turn
exterminated
by
their
fellows
the
world
would
have
been
reduced
to
a
depopulated
desert
but
the
world
revolution
has
followed
neither
of
these
lines
always
the
opponent
of
sane
social
reforms
which
socialists
deride
as
melioration
or
as
futile
attempts
to
shore
up
an
obsolete
system
it
has
consistently
disassociated
itself
from
such
men
as
lord
shaftesbury
who
did
more
to
better
the
conditions
of
the
working
classes
than
anyone
who
has
ever
lived
anarchy
on
the
other
hand
has
been
used
by
them
merely
as
a
means
to
an
end
for
genuine
revolutionary
sentiment
they
have
no
use
at
all
in
russia
the
anarchists
became
the
first
objects
of
soviet
vengeance
the
cynical
attitude
of
socialists
towards
the
revolutionary
proletariat
was
illustrated
by
bernard
shaw
who
in
december
openly
boasted
that
he
had
helped
to
organize
the
railway
strike
and
two
years
later
wrote
about
the
miners
strike
in
the
following
terms
a
socialist
state
would
not
tolerate
such
an
attack
on
the
community
as
a
strike
for
a
moment
if
a
trade
union
attempted
such
a
thing
the
old
capitalist
law
against
trade
unions
as
conspiracies
would
be
within
hours
and
put
ruthlessly
into
execution
such
a
monstrosity
as
the
recent
coal
strike
during
which
the
spent
all
their
savings
in
damaging
their
neighbours
and
wrecking
the
national
industries
would
be
impossible
under
socialism
it
was
miserably
defeated
as
it
deserved
to
be
now
if
this
had
been
written
by
the
duke
of
northumberland
in
the
instead
of
by
bernard
shaw
in
the
one
can
imagine
the
outcry
there
would
have
been
in
the
socialist
press
but
the
leaders
of
what
is
called
democracy
may
always
use
what
language
they
please
in
speaking
of
the
people
our
peasants
maxim
gorky
openly
declared
are
brutal
and
debased
hardly
human
i
hate
them
it
will
be
noticed
that
in
descriptions
of
the
french
revolution
references
to
the
savageries
of
the
people
are
never
resented
by
the
liberal
or
socialist
press
the
persons
of
the
leaders
alone
are
sacred
it
is
clearly
not
the
cause
of
democracy
but
of
demagogy
that
these
champions
of
liberty
are
out
to
defend
the
is
therefore
not
a
popular
movement
but
a
conspiracy
to
impose
on
the
people
a
system
directly
opposed
to
their
real
demands
and
aspirations
a
system
which
moreover
has
proved
disastrous
every
time
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
put
it
into
practice
russia
has
provided
a
further
example
of
its
futility
the
fact
that
the
more
responsible
leaders
in
this
country
do
not
advocate
violence
does
not
affect
the
ultimate
issue
whilst
bolshevism
sets
out
to
destroy
capitalism
at
a
blow
socialism
prefers
a
more
gradual
process
it
is
the
difference
between
clubbing
a
man
on
the
head
and
bleeding
him
to
death
that
is
all
the
fact
is
that
all
socialism
leads
to
communism
in
the
long
run
and
therefore
to
disaster
the
bolshevist
régime
brought
ruin
and
misery
to
russia
not
because
of
the
brutality
of
its
methods
but
because
it
was
founded
on
the
gigantic
economic
fallacy
that
industry
can
be
carried
on
without
private
enterprise
and
personal
initiative
the
same
theory
applied
by
constitutional
methods
would
produce
precisely
the
same
results
if
the
socialists
are
ever
allowed
to
carry
out
their
full
programme
england
may
be
reduced
to
the
state
of
russia
without
the
shedding
of
a
drop
of
blood
but
how
are
we
to
explain
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
the
failure
of
socialism
in
the
past
in
spite
of
the
gigantic
fiasco
presented
by
russia
in
spite
moreover
of
the
declaration
by
the
bolsheviks
themselves
that
communism
had
failed
and
must
be
replaced
by
a
new
economic
policy
that
is
to
say
by
a
return
to
capitalism
there
should
still
be
a
large
and
increasing
body
of
people
to
proclaim
the
efficacy
of
socialism
as
the
remedy
for
all
social
ills
in
any
other
field
of
human
experiment
in
medicine
or
mechanical
invention
failure
spells
oblivion
the
prophylactic
that
does
not
cure
the
machine
that
can
not
be
made
to
work
is
speedily
relegated
to
the
what
indeed
should
we
say
of
the
bacteriologist
who
after
killing
innumerable
patients
with
a
particular
serum
were
to
advertise
it
as
an
unqualified
success
should
we
not
brand
such
a
man
as
an
unscrupulous
charlatan
or
at
best
as
a
dangerous
visionary
if
moreover
we
were
to
find
that
large
bands
of
agents
backed
by
unlimited
funds
were
engaged
in
pressing
his
remedy
upon
the
public
and
carefully
avoiding
all
reference
to
the
fatalities
it
had
caused
should
we
not
further
conclude
that
there
was
something
behind
all
this
some
powerful
company
running
the
concern
with
a
view
to
advancing
its
own
private
interests
why
should
not
the
same
reasoning
be
applied
to
socialism
for
not
only
has
socialism
never
been
known
to
succeed
but
all
its
past
failures
are
carefully
kept
dark
by
its
exponents
who
then
stands
to
gain
by
advocating
it
and
further
who
provides
the
vast
sums
spent
on
propaganda
if
in
reality
socialism
is
a
rising
of
the
against
the
haves
how
is
it
that
most
of
the
money
seems
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
for
whilst
organizations
working
for
law
and
order
are
hampered
at
every
turn
for
funds
no
financial
considerations
ever
seem
to
interfere
with
the
activities
of
the
labour
movement
socialism
in
fact
appears
to
be
a
thoroughly
paying
concern
into
which
a
young
man
enters
as
he
might
go
into
the
city
with
the
reasonable
expectation
of
doing
well
it
is
only
necessary
to
glance
at
the
history
of
the
past
hundred
years
to
realize
that
agitation
has
provided
a
pleasant
and
remunerative
career
for
hundreds
of
authors
journalists
speakers
organizers
and
dilettantes
of
all
kinds
who
would
otherwise
have
been
condemned
to
pass
their
lives
on
or
at
schoolmasters
desks
and
when
we
read
the
accounts
of
the
delightful
treats
provided
for
these
devoted
workers
in
the
cause
of
the
proletariat
as
given
in
the
records
of
the
first
internationale
or
the
pages
of
snowden
we
begin
to
understand
the
attractions
of
socialism
as
a
profession
but
again
i
repeat
provides
the
funds
for
this
vast
do
they
come
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
workers
or
from
some
other
mysterious
reservoir
of
wealth
we
shall
return
to
this
point
in
a
later
chapter
how
is
it
possible
at
any
rate
to
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
the
exponents
of
equality
who
themselves
adopt
a
style
of
living
so
different
from
that
of
the
proletariat
whose
cause
they
profess
to
represent
if
the
doctrinaires
of
socialism
formed
a
band
of
ascetics
who
had
voluntarily
renounced
luxury
and
amusement
in
order
to
lead
lives
of
poverty
and
as
countless
really
devoted
men
and
women
calling
themselves
socialists
have
done
we
should
still
doubt
the
soundness
of
their
economic
theories
as
applied
to
society
in
general
but
we
should
respect
their
disinterestedness
but
with
very
few
exceptions
socialist
intellectuals
dine
and
sup
feast
and
amuse
themselves
with
as
few
scruples
of
conscience
as
any
unregenerate
tories
with
people
such
as
these
it
is
obviously
as
futile
to
reason
as
it
would
be
to
attempt
to
convince
the
agent
of
a
quack
medicine
company
that
the
nostrums
he
presses
on
the
public
will
not
effect
a
cure
he
is
very
well
aware
of
that
already
hence
the
efforts
of
people
to
set
forth
in
long
arguments
the
fallacies
of
socialism
produce
little
or
no
result
all
these
fallacies
have
been
exposed
repeatedly
by
able
writers
and
disproved
by
all
experience
so
that
if
based
merely
on
ignorance
or
error
they
would
long
since
have
ceased
to
obtain
credence
the
truth
is
that
they
are
not
fallacies
but
lies
deliberately
devised
and
circulated
by
men
who
do
not
believe
in
them
for
a
moment
and
who
can
therefore
only
be
described
as
unscrupulous
charlatans
exploiting
the
credulity
of
the
public
but
if
this
description
may
be
legitimately
applied
to
the
brains
behind
socialism
and
to
certain
of
its
leading
doctrinaires
there
are
doubtless
thousands
of
honest
visionaries
to
be
found
in
the
movement
a
system
that
professes
to
cure
all
the
ills
of
life
inevitably
appeals
to
generous
minds
that
feel
but
do
not
reason
in
reality
many
of
these
people
did
they
but
know
it
are
simply
social
reformers
at
heart
and
not
socialists
at
all
and
their
ignorance
of
what
socialism
really
means
leads
them
to
range
themselves
under
the
banner
of
a
party
that
claims
a
monopoly
of
ideals
others
again
particularly
amongst
the
young
intelligentsia
take
up
socialism
in
the
same
spirit
as
they
would
adopt
a
fashion
in
ties
or
waistcoats
for
fear
of
being
regarded
as
reactionaries
that
in
reality
far
from
being
advanced
the
profession
of
socialism
is
as
retrogressive
as
would
be
a
return
to
the
and
plaid
trousers
of
the
last
century
does
not
occur
to
them
the
great
triumph
of
mussolini
was
to
make
the
youth
of
italy
realize
that
to
be
a
communist
was
to
be
a
back
number
and
that
progress
consisted
in
marching
forward
to
new
ideas
and
aspirations
the
young
men
of
cabet
settlement
discovered
this
sixty
years
ago
when
they
formed
themselves
into
a
band
of
progressives
in
opposition
to
the
old
men
who
still
clung
to
the
obsolete
doctrine
of
communism
socialism
at
the
present
moment
is
in
reality
less
a
creed
than
a
cult
founded
not
on
practical
experience
but
on
unreal
theory
it
is
here
we
find
a
connexion
with
secret
societies
augustin
cochin
in
his
brilliant
essays
on
the
french
revolution
has
described
that
world
of
the
clouds
of
which
the
grand
orient
was
the
capital
peopled
by
the
precursors
of
the
french
revolution
whilst
in
the
real
world
the
criterion
of
all
thought
lies
in
putting
it
to
the
test
there
in
the
world
of
the
clouds
the
criterion
is
opinion
they
are
there
to
talk
not
to
do
all
this
intellectual
agitation
this
immense
traffic
in
speeches
writings
correspondence
leads
not
to
the
slightest
beginning
of
work
of
real
effort
we
should
be
wrong
to
judge
them
harshly
their
theories
on
the
perfectibility
of
human
nature
on
the
advantages
of
savagery
which
appear
to
us
dangerous
chimeras
were
never
intended
to
apply
to
real
life
only
to
the
world
of
the
clouds
where
they
present
no
danger
but
become
on
the
contrary
the
most
fecund
truths
the
revolutionary
explosion
might
well
have
finally
shattered
these
illusions
but
for
the
grand
orient
we
have
already
seen
the
identity
of
theory
between
french
masonry
and
french
socialism
in
the
nineteenth
century
it
was
thus
that
although
in
france
one
experiment
after
another
demonstrated
the
unreality
of
socialist
utopias
the
lodges
were
always
there
to
reconstruct
the
mirage
and
lead
humanity
on
again
across
the
burning
desert
sands
towards
the
same
phantom
and
illusory
pools
of
water
whatever
the
manner
in
which
these
ideas
penetrated
to
this
country
whether
through
the
radicals
of
the
last
century
adorers
of
the
encyclopædist
masons
of
france
or
through
the
british
disciples
of
german
social
democrats
from
the
time
of
the
first
internationale
onwards
it
is
impossible
to
ignore
the
resemblance
between
the
theories
not
only
of
french
but
of
modern
british
socialism
and
the
doctrines
of
illuminized
freemasonry
thus
the
idea
running
through
freemasonry
of
a
golden
age
before
the
fall
when
man
was
free
and
happy
and
which
through
the
application
of
masonic
principles
is
to
return
once
more
finds
an
exact
counterpart
in
the
socialist
conception
of
a
past
halcyon
era
of
liberty
and
equality
which
is
to
return
not
merely
in
the
form
of
a
regenerated
social
order
but
as
a
complete
millennium
from
which
all
the
ills
of
human
life
have
been
eliminated
this
idea
has
always
haunted
the
imagination
of
socialist
writers
from
rousseau
to
william
morris
and
leads
directly
up
to
the
further
theory
the
necessity
for
destroying
civilization
i
can
not
find
in
lothrop
stoddart
conception
of
the
revolutionary
movement
as
the
revolt
of
the
under
man
against
civilization
the
origin
of
this
campaign
in
reality
the
leaders
of
have
not
been
under
men
victims
of
oppression
or
of
adverse
fate
nor
could
they
be
ranged
in
this
category
on
account
of
physical
or
mental
inferiority
it
is
true
that
most
revolutionary
agitators
have
been
in
some
way
abnormal
and
that
the
revolutionary
army
has
largely
been
recruited
from
the
unfit
but
the
real
inspirers
of
the
movement
have
frequently
been
men
in
prosperous
circumstances
and
of
brilliant
intellect
who
might
have
distinguished
themselves
on
other
lines
had
they
not
chosen
to
devote
their
talents
to
subversion
to
call
weishaupt
for
example
an
under
man
would
be
absurd
but
let
us
see
what
is
the
idea
on
which
the
plan
of
destroying
civilization
is
ostensibly
founded
it
will
be
remembered
that
rousseau
like
weishaupt
held
that
the
golden
age
of
felicity
did
not
end
in
the
garden
of
eden
as
is
popularly
supposed
but
was
prolonged
into
tribal
and
nomadic
life
up
to
this
moment
communism
was
the
happy
disposition
under
which
the
human
race
existed
and
which
vanished
with
the
introduction
of
civilization
civilization
is
therefore
the
et
origo
and
should
be
done
away
with
let
no
one
exclaim
that
this
theory
died
out
either
with
rousseau
or
with
weishaupt
the
idea
that
civilization
is
all
wrong
runs
all
through
the
writings
and
speeches
of
our
intellectual
socialists
i
have
referred
elsewhere
to
prediction
that
mankind
will
more
and
more
revert
to
the
nomadic
life
and
snowden
has
recently
referred
in
tones
of
evident
nostalgia
to
that
productive
era
when
man
lived
under
a
system
of
tribal
communism
the
children
who
attend
the
socialist
schools
are
also
taught
in
the
red
catechism
the
advantages
of
savagery
thus
question
do
savages
starve
in
the
midst
of
plenty
answer
no
when
there
is
plenty
of
food
they
all
rejoice
feast
and
make
merry
that
when
there
is
not
plenty
of
food
they
occasionally
eat
each
other
is
not
mentioned
here
then
is
the
theory
on
which
this
yearning
for
a
return
to
nature
is
based
for
it
is
quite
probable
that
if
a
golden
age
ever
existed
it
was
communistic
it
is
also
true
that
certain
primitive
tribes
have
found
it
possible
to
continue
the
same
system
for
the
simple
reason
that
when
and
where
the
earth
was
very
thinly
populated
it
brought
forth
without
the
artificial
aid
of
agriculture
more
than
enough
to
supply
each
man
needs
there
was
therefore
no
need
for
laws
to
protect
property
since
every
man
could
help
himself
freely
to
all
that
he
required
if
at
the
present
time
a
dozen
people
were
shipwrecked
on
a
fertile
island
some
miles
in
area
the
institution
of
property
would
be
equally
superfluous
if
however
several
hundred
were
to
share
the
same
fate
it
would
at
once
become
necessary
to
institute
some
system
of
cultivation
which
in
its
turn
would
necessitate
either
the
institution
of
property
by
which
each
man
would
depend
on
his
own
plot
of
land
for
his
existence
or
a
communal
system
by
which
all
would
be
obliged
to
work
for
the
common
good
and
force
applied
to
those
who
refused
to
do
their
allotted
share
peaceful
communism
is
thus
simply
a
matter
of
population
the
conditions
under
which
men
can
sit
in
the
sun
and
enjoy
the
fruits
of
the
earth
with
little
effort
must
be
transformed
with
the
multiplication
of
the
human
species
into
a
system
which
recognizes
private
property
or
a
communal
state
which
enforces
compulsory
labour
by
means
of
overseers
with
whips
it
was
perhaps
an
appreciation
of
this
truth
that
impelled
the
practical
exponents
of
rousseau
doctrines
the
terrorists
of
to
embark
on
their
plan
of
depopulation
by
way
of
establishing
communism
on
a
peaceful
basis
but
our
intellectual
socialists
deny
this
necessity
on
the
ground
that
under
the
benign
régime
of
socialism
all
men
would
be
good
and
happy
and
would
work
joyfully
for
the
welfare
of
the
community
the
fact
that
this
has
not
proved
the
case
even
in
voluntary
communist
settlements
does
not
daunt
them
because
as
has
been
said
their
creed
is
founded
not
on
practical
experiment
but
on
theory
and
it
is
here
that
we
again
find
the
inspiration
of
grand
orient
freemasonry
the
assumption
that
under
an
ideal
social
order
all
human
failings
would
vanish
derives
directly
from
the
two
masonic
doctrines
which
the
grand
orient
under
the
influence
of
illuminism
has
brought
to
a
ad
the
perfectibility
of
human
nature
and
universal
brotherhood
the
whole
philosophy
of
socialism
is
built
upon
these
false
premises
indeed
the
actual
phraseology
of
illuminized
freemasonry
has
now
passed
into
the
language
of
socialism
thus
the
old
formulæ
of
the
united
states
of
europe
and
the
universal
republic
have
been
adopted
not
only
by
besant
and
her
followers
as
the
last
word
in
modern
thought
but
have
also
reappeared
as
a
brilliant
inspiration
under
the
pen
of
wells
in
the
slightly
varied
form
of
the
world
state
it
would
be
amusing
for
anyone
who
had
the
time
to
discover
how
many
of
the
ideas
of
our
advanced
thinkers
might
be
found
almost
verbatim
in
the
writings
of
weishaupt
the
of
anacharsis
clootz
and
in
the
speeches
of
grand
orient
orators
during
the
last
century
moreover
the
is
not
only
founded
on
the
doctrines
of
illuminized
freemasonry
but
has
adopted
the
same
method
of
organization
thus
after
the
plan
of
the
secret
societies
from
the
batinis
onward
we
shall
find
the
forces
of
revolution
divided
into
successive
grades
the
lowest
consisting
of
the
revolutionary
proletariat
the
a
as
marx
expressed
it
knowing
nothing
of
the
theory
of
socialism
still
less
of
the
real
aims
of
the
leaders
above
this
the
the
doctrinaires
of
socialism
comprising
doubtless
many
sincere
enthusiasts
but
above
these
again
further
grades
leading
up
to
the
real
initiates
who
alone
know
whither
the
whole
movement
is
tending
for
the
final
goal
of
is
not
socialism
or
even
communism
it
is
not
a
change
in
the
existing
economic
system
it
is
not
the
destruction
of
civilization
in
a
material
sense
the
revolution
desired
by
the
leaders
is
a
moral
and
spiritual
revolution
an
anarchy
of
ideas
by
which
all
standards
set
up
throughout
nineteen
centuries
shall
be
reversed
all
honoured
traditions
trampled
under
foot
and
above
all
the
christian
ideal
finally
obliterated
it
is
true
that
a
certain
section
of
the
socialist
movement
proclaims
itself
christian
the
illuminati
made
the
same
profession
so
have
the
modern
theosophists
and
rosicrucians
but
as
in
the
case
of
these
secret
societies
we
should
ask
of
christian
socialists
what
do
they
means
by
christ
what
do
they
mean
by
christianity
on
examination
it
will
be
found
that
their
christ
is
a
being
of
their
own
inventing
that
their
christianity
is
a
perversion
of
christ
real
teaching
the
christ
of
socialism
invoked
in
the
interests
of
pacifism
as
the
opponent
of
force
and
in
the
interests
of
class
warfare
as
a
socialist
a
revolutionary
or
even
an
agitator
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
real
christ
christ
was
not
a
pacifist
when
he
told
his
disciples
to
arm
themselves
with
swords
when
he
made
a
scourge
of
cords
and
drove
the
from
the
temple
he
did
not
tell
men
to
forgive
the
enemies
of
their
country
or
of
their
religion
but
only
their
private
enemies
christ
was
not
a
socialist
when
he
declared
that
a
man
life
consisteth
not
in
the
abundance
of
the
things
that
he
possesseth
socialism
teaches
that
a
man
must
never
rest
content
as
long
as
another
man
possesses
that
which
he
has
not
christ
did
not
believe
in
equality
of
payment
when
he
told
the
parable
of
the
ten
talents
and
the
unprofitable
servant
socialism
would
reduce
all
labour
to
the
pace
of
the
slowest
above
all
christ
was
not
a
socialist
when
he
bade
the
young
man
who
had
great
possessions
sell
all
that
he
had
and
give
it
to
the
poor
school
of
socialism
has
ever
issued
such
a
command
on
the
contrary
socialists
are
enjoined
by
their
leaders
not
to
give
their
money
away
in
charity
lest
they
should
help
by
this
means
to
prolong
the
existence
of
the
present
social
system
the
truth
is
that
as
i
showed
in
connexion
with
the
fallacy
of
representing
christ
as
an
essene
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
that
he
or
his
disciples
practised
even
the
purest
form
of
communism
christ
did
not
advocate
any
economic
or
political
system
he
preached
a
spirit
which
if
applied
to
any
system
would
lead
to
peace
among
men
it
is
true
that
he
enjoined
his
disciples
to
despise
riches
and
that
he
denounced
many
of
the
rich
men
with
whom
he
came
into
contact
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
his
immediate
mission
was
to
a
race
that
had
always
glorified
riches
that
had
worshipped
the
golden
calf
and
by
which
wealth
was
regarded
as
the
natural
reward
of
godliness
christ
came
to
teach
men
not
to
look
for
present
reward
in
the
form
of
increased
material
welfare
but
to
do
good
out
of
love
to
god
and
one
neighbour
i
do
not
doubt
that
in
the
past
such
men
as
kingsley
and
maurice
sincerely
imagined
that
they
were
following
in
the
footsteps
of
the
master
by
describing
themselves
as
christian
socialists
but
that
the
present
leaders
of
socialism
in
england
are
christians
at
heart
is
impossible
to
believe
in
view
of
their
attitude
towards
the
campaign
against
christianity
in
russia
never
once
have
they
or
their
allies
the
quakers
officially
denounced
the
persecution
not
only
of
the
priests
but
of
all
who
profess
the
christian
faith
in
russia
listen
to
this
voice
from
the
abyss
of
russia
we
very
much
ask
for
prayer
for
the
church
of
russia
it
is
passing
through
great
tribulation
and
it
is
a
question
whether
spiritual
or
earthly
power
will
triumph
many
are
being
executed
for
not
denying
god
those
placed
by
god
at
the
helm
need
all
the
prayer
and
help
of
christians
all
over
the
earth
because
their
fate
is
partly
theirs
too
for
it
is
a
question
of
faith
triumphing
over
atheism
and
it
is
a
between
those
two
principles
and
again
i
look
upon
the
persecution
of
the
russian
church
as
an
effort
to
overthrow
christianity
in
general
for
we
are
governed
just
now
by
the
power
of
darkness
and
all
that
we
consider
sinful
seems
to
get
the
upper
hand
and
to
prosper
yet
it
is
for
this
power
that
the
socialist
party
of
great
britain
have
for
years
been
demanding
recognition
even
the
appeals
for
help
from
their
in
russia
have
left
them
cold
we
would
suggest
ran
one
such
appeal
that
the
british
labour
party
issue
an
official
protest
against
the
soviet
government
inhuman
treatment
of
its
political
opponents
in
general
and
the
political
prisoners
in
particular
that
meetings
of
protest
should
be
organized
in
the
industrial
towns
of
great
britain
that
the
british
labour
party
make
an
official
representation
to
the
soviet
government
directly
urging
the
latter
to
put
a
stop
to
the
persecutions
of
the
socialists
in
russia
and
it
was
of
this
régime
that
lansbury
wrote
whatever
their
faults
the
communist
leaders
of
russia
have
hitched
their
wagon
to
a
star
the
star
of
love
brotherhood
comradeship
the
callous
indifference
displayed
by
british
socialists
with
the
honourable
exception
of
the
social
democratic
federation
towards
the
crimes
of
the
bolsheviks
offers
indeed
a
painful
contrast
to
the
attitude
of
the
other
socialists
of
europe
at
the
conference
of
the
labour
and
socialist
international
at
hamburg
in
may
a
resolution
was
passed
condemning
the
persecution
by
the
soviet
government
when
the
resolution
was
put
to
the
congress
voted
for
against
it
and
including
the
british
delegates
abstained
i
ask
then
why
should
the
socialists
of
great
britain
be
differentiated
from
the
bolsheviks
of
russia
in
every
question
of
importance
they
have
always
lent
them
their
support
in
the
great
war
on
christianity
they
have
acted
as
the
advance
guard
by
the
institution
of
socialist
from
which
all
religious
teaching
is
excluded
socialists
are
very
anxious
to
disassociate
these
from
the
proletarian
which
teach
atheism
but
from
ignoring
the
existence
of
god
to
denying
it
is
but
a
step
moreover
it
will
be
noticed
that
the
socialists
have
never
issued
any
protests
against
the
blasphemies
of
the
proletarian
schools
the
real
attitude
of
the
socialist
party
towards
religion
may
perhaps
be
gauged
by
the
notice
reproduced
on
page
which
once
appeared
in
its
official
organ
the
of
which
lansbury
widely
advertised
as
a
fervent
christian
was
once
editor
and
is
now
managing
director
it
was
to
the
party
controlling
this
organ
that
clergymen
of
the
church
of
england
and
the
episcopal
church
of
scotland
saw
fit
to
offer
their
congratulations
by
means
of
a
memorial
presented
to
ramsay
macdonald
in
march
shall
we
yet
see
the
scene
of
brumaire
repeated
and
a
procession
of
prelates
presenting
themselves
at
westminster
to
lay
down
their
rings
and
crosses
and
declare
that
henceforth
there
shall
be
no
other
worship
than
that
of
liberty
and
holy
equality
already
the
desecration
of
the
churches
has
begun
the
red
flag
was
recently
carried
into
the
city
temple
by
a
band
of
unemployed
although
several
of
their
number
objected
to
its
presence
in
the
church
an
attempt
to
sing
the
red
flag
was
also
suppressed
by
a
section
of
the
unemployed
illustration
b
books
we
all
pretend
to
have
read
the
bible
is
a
real
book
although
during
the
whole
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
churches
turned
a
blind
eye
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
free
translation
by
jacobean
clergymen
of
a
greek
text
of
doubtful
authenticity
and
of
multiple
authorship
the
bible
is
as
divinely
inspired
as
shakespeare
or
milton
or
anatole
france
but
it
is
not
as
pure
as
the
texts
of
these
authors
for
it
is
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
folk
and
traditional
history
bound
to
and
described
as
the
old
testament
and
the
new
testament
a
collection
of
eastern
theological
doctrines
centralized
in
the
figure
of
a
great
syrian
mystic
religious
teacher
jesus
those
who
will
go
to
the
bible
with
an
unprejudiced
mind
will
discover
that
it
is
one
of
the
great
books
of
the
world
full
of
beauty
humour
and
aspiration
and
disfigured
as
great
books
often
are
by
occasional
brutalities
and
crudities
february

who
had
apparently
retained
some
sense
ot
decency
weishaupt
design
of
enlisting
the
clergy
in
the
work
of
has
been
carried
out
according
to
plan
those
catholic
priests
in
ireland
who
inflamed
popular
passions
acted
as
the
tools
of
the
international
atheist
conspiracy
and
found
at
last
the
movement
turning
against
themselves
the
protestant
clergymen
who
profess
christian
socialism
are
playing
the
same
part
doubtless
without
knowing
it
they
act
as
the
agents
of
the
continental
illuminati
and
pave
the
way
as
did
the
emissaries
of
weishaupt
for
the
open
attack
on
all
forms
of
religion
it
is
not
a
mere
accident
that
the
blasphemous
masquerades
of
the
french
revolution
have
recently
been
repeated
in
russia
the
horrible
incidents
described
in
the
press
were
simply
the
outward
manifestation
of
a
continuous
conspiracy
of
which
evidence
was
seen
some
years
ago
in
portugal
under
the
influence
of
the
carbonarios
led
by
alfonso
costa
whose
utterances
at
times
bore
a
striking
resemblance
to
those
of
anacharsis
clootz
the
late
duchess
of
bedford
thus
described
the
war
on
religion
which
inaugurated
the
new
republic
one
of
the
most
zealous
enterprises
of
this
great
society
the
carbonarios
is
in
their
own
words
to
exterminate
the
christian
myth
in
the
minds
of
the
nation
of
portugal
the
little
children
in
the
schools
have
badges
pinned
into
their
clothes
with
the
words
no
god
no
religion
and
a
british
tourist
who
made
a
journey
throughout
the
country
of
portugal
met
bands
of
innocent
babes
carrying
banners
on
which
the
inscription
was
we
have
no
need
of
god
is
it
only
a
coincidence
that
last
year
a
socialist
and
communist
meeting
in
trafalgar
square
displayed
a
red
banner
bearing
the
motto
no
king
no
god
no
law
i
repeat
it
is
not
an
economic
revolution
which
forms
the
plan
of
the
real
directors
of
the
movement
it
is
neither
the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
nor
the
reorganization
of
society
by
the
intelligentsia
of
labour
it
is
the
destruction
of
the
christian
idea
socialist
orators
may
inveigh
against
corrupt
aristocracy
or
bloated
capitalists
but
these
are
not
in
reality
the
people
who
will
suffer
most
if
the
aim
of
the
conspiracy
is
achieved
the
has
always
shown
itself
indulgent
towards
selfish
and
corrupt
aristocrats
from
the
marquis
de
sade
and
the
duc
onwards
it
is
the
gentle
the
upright
the
benevolent
who
have
fallen
victims
to
revolutionary
fury
socialism
with
its
hatred
of
all
superiority
of
noble
virtues
loyalty
and
patriotism
with
its
passion
for
dragging
down
instead
of
building
up
serves
the
purpose
of
the
deeper
conspiracy
if
the
christian
intelligentsia
can
be
destroyed
or
won
over
and
the
nation
deprived
of
all
its
natural
leaders
the
reckon
that
they
will
be
able
to
mould
the
proletariat
according
to
their
desires
this
being
so
the
thing
we
now
call
bolshevism
forms
only
one
phase
of
the
movement
which
is
carried
on
by
countless
different
methods
apparently
disconnected
but
all
tending
towards
the
same
end
we
have
only
to
look
around
us
in
the
world
to
see
everywhere
the
same
disintegrating
power
at
work
in
art
literature
the
drama
the
daily
press
in
every
sphere
that
can
influence
the
mind
of
the
public
just
as
in
the
french
revolution
a
play
on
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
was
staged
in
order
to
rouse
the
passions
of
the
people
against
the
monarchy
so
our
modern
cinemas
perpetually
endeavour
to
stir
up
class
hatred
by
scenes
and
phrases
showing
the
injustice
of
kings
the
sufferings
of
the
people
the
selfishness
of
aristocrats
regardles
of
whether
these
enter
into
the
theme
of
the
narrative
or
not
and
in
the
realms
of
literature
not
merely
in
works
of
fiction
but
in
manuals
for
schools
in
histories
and
books
professing
to
be
of
serious
educative
value
and
receiving
a
skilfully
organized
boom
throughout
the
press
everything
is
done
to
weaken
patriotism
to
shake
belief
in
all
existing
institutions
by
the
systematic
perversion
of
both
contemporary
and
historical
facts
whilst
novels
and
plays
calculated
to
undermine
all
ideas
of
morality
are
pressed
upon
the
public
as
works
of
genius
which
in
order
to
maintain
a
reputation
for
intellect
it
is
essential
to
admire
i
do
not
believe
that
all
this
is
accidental
i
do
not
believe
that
the
public
asks
for
the
or
demoralizing
books
and
plays
placed
before
it
on
the
contrary
it
invariably
responds
to
an
appeal
to
patriotism
and
simple
healthy
emotions
the
heart
of
the
people
is
still
sound
but
ceaseless
efforts
are
made
to
corrupt
it
this
conspiracy
has
long
been
apparent
to
continental
observers
some
years
before
the
war
monsieur
de
lannoy
a
member
of
an
association
in
france
at
a
conference
on
the
influence
of
sects
in
the
theatre
in
literature
in
the
fashions
showed
how
orders
of
things
which
appear
to
have
no
connexion
with
each
other
are
skilfully
bound
up
together
and
directed
by
a
single
methodical
movement
towards
a
common
end
this
common
end
is
the
paganization
of
the
universe
the
destruction
of
all
christianity
the
return
to
the
loosest
morals
of
antiquity
robison
saw
in
the
indecent
dress
of
the
period
of
the
directory
the
result
of
teaching
and
traces
to
the
same
cause
the
ceremony
which
took
place
in
notre
dame
when
a
woman
of
loose
morals
was
held
up
to
the
admiration
of
the
public
the
same
glorification
of
vice
has
found
exponents
amongst
the
modern
illuminati
in
this
country
in
equinox
the
journal
of
scientific
it
is
proposed
that
prostitutes
should
be
placed
on
the
same
level
as
soldiers
who
have
served
their
country
and
be
honoured
and
pensioned
by
the
state
the
community
of
women
was
not
an
idea
that
originated
with
the
russian
bolsheviks
but
one
that
has
run
through
all
the
revolutionary
movements
of
the
past
the
attempt
to
pervert
all
conceptions
of
beauty
in
the
sphere
of
art
serves
to
pave
the
way
for
moral
perversion
in
the
york
two
years
ago
there
appeared
a
circular
protesting
against
the
modernistic
cult
in
art
as
bolshevist
propaganda
the
circular
went
on
to
declare
this
aims
to
overthrow
and
destroy
all
existing
social
systems
including
that
of
the
arts
this
modernistic
degenerate
cult
is
simply
the
bolshevist
philosophy
applied
in
art
the
triumph
of
bolshevism
therefore
means
the
destruction
of
the
present
æsthetic
system
the
transportation
of
all
æsthetic
values
and
the
deification
of
ugliness
the
whole
propaganda
of
the
movement
was
said
to
be
organized
by
a
coterie
of
european
elsewhere
described
as
german
who
had
flooded
the
market
with
the
works
of
artists
who
began
as
a
small
group
of
neurotic
egomaniacs
in
paris
styling
themselves
worshippers
of
satan
the
god
of
ugliness
some
of
these
men
were
suffering
from
the
visual
derangement
of
the
insane
whilst
many
of
the
pictures
exhibited
another
form
of
mania
the
system
of
this
is
an
incontrollable
desire
to
mutilate
the
human
body
sadism
as
we
know
played
a
prominent
part
in
both
the
french
and
russian
revolutions
the
most
important
point
in
all
this
is
not
that
degenerates
should
be
found
to
perpetrate
these
abominations
but
what
the
circular
describes
as
the
machiavellian
campaign
organized
for
the
unloading
of
these
works
editions
de
luxe
were
published
and
sold
by
the
picture
dealers
every
crafty
device
known
to
the
picture
trade
was
resorted
to
in
order
to
discredit
and
destroy
the
heretofore
universally
accepted
standards
of
aesthetics
this
process
of
reversing
all
accepted
standards
may
also
be
brought
about
by
subtler
methods
we
have
already
seen
that
occult
practices
may
lead
to
the
obliteration
of
all
sense
of
truth
and
of
normal
sexual
instincts
under
the
influence
of
occult
science
which
is
in
reality
simply
powerful
suggestion
or
all
a
natural
impulses
and
inhibitive
springs
of
action
may
be
broken
he
will
no
longer
react
to
the
conceptions
of
beauty
or
ugliness
or
right
or
wrong
which
unknown
to
himself
formed
the
law
of
his
being
thus
not
only
his
conscious
deeds
but
his
subconscious
mental
processes
may
pass
under
the
control
of
another
or
become
entirely
deranged
much
the
same
consequences
may
result
from
the
freud
system
of
which
particularly
by
its
insistence
on
sex
tends
to
subordinate
the
will
to
impulses
of
a
harmful
kind
an
eminent
american
of
new
york
has
expressed
his
opinion
on
this
subject
in
the
following
words
the
freud
theory
is
and
subversive
of
organized
society
christianity
teaches
that
the
individual
can
resist
temptation
and
freudism
teaches
that
the
matter
of
yielding
to
or
resisting
temptation
is
one
for
which
the
individual
is
not
wilfully
responsible
freudism
makes
of
the
individual
a
machine
absolutely
controlled
by
subconscious
reflexes
it
would
of
course
be
difficult
to
prove
that
has
been
evolved
as
a
destructive
propaganda
measure
but
in
one
sense
the
point
is
immaterial
whether
conscious
or
unconscious
it
makes
for
destructive
effect
in
general
the
art
of
the
conspiracy
is
not
so
much
to
create
movements
as
to
capture
existing
movements
often
innocuous
and
even
admirable
in
themselves
and
turn
them
to
a
subversive
purpose
thus
birth
control
which
if
combined
with
the
restriction
of
alien
immigration
and
carried
out
under
proper
direction
would
provide
a
solution
to
the
frightful
problem
of
can
without
these
provisos
become
a
source
of
national
weakness
and
demoralization
it
is
easy
to
see
how
a
limitation
of
the
native
population
would
serve
the
cause
of
enemies
by
reducing
her
fighting
forces
and
by
making
room
for
undesirable
aliens
that
the
campaign
may
also
be
used
for
evil
purposes
is
suggested
by
the
fact
that
it
has
not
been
confined
to
our
own
overcrowded
island
but
has
been
carried
on
in
france
where
has
long
constituted
a
tragedy
in
and
the
ligue
de
la
régéneration
humaine
founded
by
monsieur
paul
robin
in
its
organ
issued
not
only
instructions
on
the
means
how
to
avoid
large
families
but
also
pamphlets
on
free
love
and
free
maternity
the
campaign
of
was
thus
combined
with
the
undermining
of
morality
legal
families
were
to
be
limited
and
illegal
births
encouraged
this
was
quite
in
accord
with
the
doctrines
of
the
grand
orient
in
whose
temples
monsieur
copin
albancelli
points
out
the
principle
of
la
libre
maternité
known
in
this
country
as
the
right
to
motherhood
was
advocated
it
is
curious
to
notice
that
the
apparently
innocent
invention
of
esperanto
receives
support
from
the
same
quarter
this
is
not
surprising
since
we
know
that
the
idea
of
a
universal
language
has
long
haunted
the
minds
of
freemasons
i
have
myself
seen
a
document
emanating
from
a
body
of
french
masons
stating
that
esperanto
is
directly
under
the
control
of
the
three
masonic
powers
of
france
the
grand
orient
the
grande
loge
nationale
and
the
droit
humain
that
it
is
largely
used
for
promoting
bolshevism
has
been
frequently
stated
in
july
bérard
minister
of
education
issued
a
circular
to
the
heads
of
all
french
universities
academies
and
colleges
calling
on
them
not
to
help
in
any
way
in
the
teaching
of
esperanto
on
the
ground
that
bolsheviks
use
it
as
one
of
their
dangerous
forms
of
propaganda
a
correspondent
points
out
to
me
that
another
universal
language
ido
is
used
for
propaganda
by
the
anarchists
and
that
several
journals
distributed
by
revolutionary
societies
written
in
ido
are
frankly
and
baldly
anarchical
the
writer
adds
last
week
i
received
a
copy
of
liberty
monthly
organ
of
the
anarchist
section
of
the
emancipating
star
cosmopolitan
union
of
idists
it
commands
carrying
out
anarchistic
principles
to
their
extreme
limits
commends
la
ruzo
ruse
is
sarcastic
regarding
socialism
and
democracy
it
contains
an
appeal
for
help
in
money
for
the
anarchists
imprisoned
in
russia
written
by
alexander
berkmann
and
signed
by
him
with
emma
goldmann
and
schapiro
here
then
we
have
a
revolutionary
movement
which
is
and
even
which
tends
to
prove
the
opinion
i
have
already
expressed
that
bolshevism
is
only
one
phase
of
the
but
if
we
explain
this
by
the
old
antagonism
between
the
opposing
revolutionary
camps
of
anarchy
and
socialism
how
are
we
to
account
for
the
fact
that
the
same
destructive
purpose
animates
people
who
are
neither
anarchist
nor
socialist
but
can
only
be
ranged
in
the
category
of
extreme
reaction
of
this
phase
of
the
movement
nietzsche
provides
the
supreme
example
in
his
imprecations
against
the
crucified
the
advocate
of
autocracy
and
militarism
rivals
the
most
infuriated
of
revolutionary
socialists
the
whole
spirit
of
perversion
is
contained
in
the
description
of
nietzsche
by
his
friend
georges
brandes
his
thoughts
stole
inquisitively
along
forbidden
paths
thing
passes
for
a
value
can
we
not
turn
it
this
is
regarded
as
good
is
it
not
rather
evil
what
is
this
but
satanism
the
case
of
nietzsche
is
not
to
be
explained
away
by
the
fact
that
he
died
raving
mad
since
a
number
of
apparently
sane
people
still
profess
for
him
unbounded
admiration
and
whilst
deriding
socialism
and
even
attacking
bolshevism
join
in
the
war
against
christian
civilization
the
conspiracy
therefore
exists
apart
from
democratic
circles
not
long
ago
i
picked
up
an
italian
novel
by
an
containing
precisely
the
same
diatribes
against
society
that
are
to
be
found
in
anarchist
and
bolshevist
literature
the
family
says
the
author
is
the
kernel
of
contemporary
society
and
its
base
whoever
would
really
reform
or
subvert
must
begin
by
reforming
and
subverting
the
family
the
family
is
the
principal
path
of
all
unhappiness
of
all
vice
of
all
hypocrisy
of
all
moral
ugliness
and
he
goes
on
to
show
that
the
two
countries
which
have
proved
themselves
the
sanest
and
the
strongest
are
germany
and
america
because
they
have
advanced
by
long
strides
towards
free
love
the
writer
of
these
words
may
be
of
no
importance
but
they
should
be
noted
because
they
are
symptomatic
and
help
us
to
locate
certain
centres
of
infection
it
is
impossible
to
observe
all
these
miscellaneous
movements
going
on
all
around
us
without
being
struck
by
the
similarity
of
aim
between
them
each
seems
to
form
part
of
a
common
plan
which
like
the
separate
pieces
of
a
puzzle
convey
no
meaning
but
when
fitted
together
make
up
a
perfectly
clear
design
that
there
is
somewhere
in
the
background
a
point
of
contact
is
suggested
by
the
fact
that
we
find
members
of
the
different
groups
playing
a
double
and
a
treble
rôle
the
same
name
occurring
in
the
list
of
patrons
in
a
birth
control
paper
and
in
a
revolutionary
secret
society
amongst
the
exponents
of
and
the
members
of
an
irish
republican
committee
with
the
open
as
with
the
secret
forces
the
great
method
of
warfare
is
the
capture
of
public
opinion
a
hidden
influence
behind
the
press
contributes
powerfully
to
this
end
some
of
the
subtlest
disintegrating
propaganda
during
the
last
seven
years
has
emanated
from
the
capitalist
press
the
is
only
the
brass
band
of
the
revolution
it
is
to
the
journals
inspired
and
patronized
by
the
intelligentsia
that
we
must
turn
to
find
the
doctrines
of
illuminism
set
forth
with
the
most
persuasive
eloquence
more
than
eighty
years
ago
a
frenchman
endowed
with
extraordinary
prophetic
instinct
foretold
not
only
the
danger
that
would
one
day
come
from
russia
but
that
the
press
would
facilitate
the
destruction
of
civilization
when
our
cosmopolitan
democracy
bearing
its
last
fruits
shall
have
made
of
war
a
thing
odious
to
whole
populations
when
the
nations
calling
themselves
the
most
civilized
on
earth
shall
have
finished
enervating
themselves
in
their
political
debaucheries
the
floodgates
of
the
north
will
open
on
us
once
again
then
we
shall
undergo
a
last
invasion
not
of
ignorant
barbarians
but
of
cunning
and
enlightened
masters
more
enlightened
than
ourselves
for
they
will
have
learnt
from
our
own
excesses
how
we
can
and
must
be
governed
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
providence
piles
up
so
many
inactive
forces
in
the
east
of
europe
one
day
the
sleeping
giant
will
arise
and
force
will
put
an
end
to
the
reign
of
words
in
vain
then
distracted
equality
will
call
the
old
aristocracy
to
the
help
of
liberty
the
weapon
grasped
again
too
late
and
wielded
by
hands
too
long
inactive
will
have
become
powerless
society
will
perish
for
having
trusted
to
words
void
of
sense
or
contradictory
then
the
deceitful
echoes
of
public
opinion
the
newspapers
wishing
at
all
costs
to
keep
their
readers
will
push
the
world
to
ruin
if
only
to
have
something
to
relate
for
a
month
longer
they
will
kill
society
to
live
upon
its
corpse
the
newspapers
no
longer
the
echoes
of
public
opinion
but
its
supreme
directors
throw
open
their
columns
to
every
form
of
disintegrating
doctrine
and
close
them
to
arguments
that
could
effectually
arrest
the
forces
of
destruction
what
is
the
hidden
influence
behind
the
press
behind
all
the
subversive
movements
going
on
around
us
are
there
several
powers
at
work
or
is
there
one
power
one
invisible
group
directing
all
the
rest
the
circle
of
the
we
have
seen
in
the
course
of
this
book
that
the
idea
of
a
secret
power
working
for
through
both
open
movements
and
secret
societies
is
not
a
new
one
but
dates
from
the
eighteenth
century
in
order
to
appreciate
the
continuity
of
this
idea
let
us
recapitulate
the
testimonies
of
contemporaries
some
of
which
have
been
already
quoted
in
their
context
but
which
when
collected
together
and
placed
in
chronological
order
make
up
a
very
remarkable
chain
of
evidence
in
the
marquis
de
luchet
warned
france
of
the
danger
of
the
illuminati
whose
object
was
in
consequence
of
this
gigantic
project
de
luchet
foresees
a
series
of
calamities
of
which
the
end
is
lost
in
the
darkness
of
time
like
unto
those
subterranean
fires
of
which
the
insatiable
activity
devours
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
which
escape
into
the
air
by
violent
and
devastating
explosions
in
the
duke
of
brunswick
in
his
manifesto
to
the
german
lodges
said
a
great
sect
arose
which
taking
for
its
motto
the
good
and
happiness
of
man
worked
in
the
darkness
of
the
conspiracy
to
make
the
happiness
of
humanity
a
prey
for
itself
this
sect
is
known
to
everyone
its
brothers
are
known
no
less
than
its
name
the
plan
they
had
formed
for
breaking
all
social
ties
and
of
destroying
all
order
was
revealed
in
their
speeches
and
acts
indomitable
pride
thirst
of
power
such
were
the
only
motives
of
this
sect
their
masters
had
nothing
less
in
view
than
the
thrones
of
the
earth
and
the
government
of
the
nations
was
to
be
directed
by
their
nocturnal
clubs
in
montjoie
writing
of
the
orléaniste
conspiracy
to
which
in
an
earlier
work
he
had
attributed
the
whole
organization
of
the
french
revolution
in
its
first
stages
observed
i
will
not
examine
whether
this
wicked
prince
thinking
he
was
acting
in
his
personal
interests
was
not
moved
by
that
which
seems
to
have
created
all
the
events
of
our
revolution
in
order
to
lead
us
towards
a
goal
that
we
do
not
see
at
present
but
which
i
think
we
shall
see
before
long
in
monsignor
de
savine
made
allusions
in
prudent
and
almost
terrified
terms
to
some
international
sect
a
power
superior
to
all
others
which
has
arms
and
eyes
everywhere
and
which
governs
europe
in
the
chevalier
de
malet
declared
that
the
authors
of
the
revolution
are
not
more
french
than
german
italian
english
etc
they
form
a
particular
nation
which
took
birth
and
has
increased
in
the
dark
amidst
all
civilized
nations
with
the
object
of
subjecting
them
all
to
its
domination
in
the
carbonaro
malegari
wrote
to
another
member
of
the
carbonari
we
form
an
association
of
brothers
in
all
points
of
the
globe
we
have
desires
and
interests
in
common
we
aim
at
the
emancipation
of
humanity
we
wish
to
break
every
kind
of
yoke
yet
there
is
one
that
is
unseen
that
can
hardly
be
felt
yet
that
weighs
on
us
whence
comes
it
where
is
it
no
one
knows
or
at
least
no
one
tells
the
association
is
secret
even
for
us
the
veterans
of
secret
societies
in
disraeli
wrote
it
was
neither
parliaments
nor
populations
nor
the
course
of
nature
nor
the
course
of
events
that
overthrew
the
throne
of
louis
philippe
the
throne
was
surprised
by
the
secret
societies
ever
prepared
to
ravage
europe
acting
in
unison
with
a
great
popular
movement
they
may
destroy
society
as
they
did
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
in
père
deschamps
after
his
exhaustive
study
of
secret
societies
thus
propounded
the
question
we
have
now
to
ask
ourselves
whether
there
is
anything
but
an
identity
of
doctrines
and
personal
communications
between
the
members
of
the
different
sects
whether
there
is
really
a
unity
of
direction
which
binds
together
all
the
secret
societies
including
free
masonry
here
we
touch
on
the
most
mysterious
point
of
the
action
of
secret
societies
on
that
which
these
national
grand
orients
who
declare
themselves
independent
of
each
other
and
sometimes
even
excommunicate
each
other
conceal
most
carefully
beneath
a
veil
finally
deschamps
is
led
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
secret
council
which
directs
all
masonic
societies
that
there
are
secret
lairs
where
the
chiefs
of
the
sects
agree
together
on
their
work
of
destruction
it
would
be
easy
to
multiply
quotations
of
this
kind
taken
from
many
different
sources
whether
the
men
who
expressed
these
opinions
were
as
we
are
frequently
told
suffering
from
delusions
or
not
the
fact
remains
that
the
idea
of
a
hidden
hand
behind
has
existed
for
at
least
years
and
when
we
compare
these
utterances
with
monsieur
copin
albancelli
description
of
an
inner
circle
secretly
directing
the
activities
of
the
grand
orient
and
with
the
conclusions
reached
by
members
of
other
secret
societies
that
such
a
circle
exists
behind
all
occult
and
masonic
societies
of
a
subversive
kind
we
are
necessarily
led
to
enquire
is
there
one
circle
or
rather
one
power
behind
both
open
and
secret
organizations
working
for
the
overthrow
of
the
existing
social
order
and
christian
civilization
if
so
what
is
this
power
now
to
leave
speculation
for
the
moment
and
come
to
known
facts
everyone
who
has
seriously
studied
these
matters
is
aware
that
there
are
at
the
present
moment
five
principal
organized
movements
at
work
in
the
world
with
which
ordered
government
has
to
contend
that
may
be
summarized
as
follows
grand
orient
freemasonry
theosophy
with
its
innumerable
ramifications
nationalism
of
an
aggressive
kind
now
represented
by
international
finance
social
revolution
it
will
be
seen
that
with
the
exception
of
the
fourth
these
movements
are
those
of
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
trace
the
course
throughout
the
earlier
part
of
this
book
it
is
a
highly
significant
fact
that
it
was
only
when
i
had
reached
this
stage
of
my
work
i
discovered
there
were
independent
investigators
who
had
arrived
at
precisely
the
same
conclusions
as
myself
the
problem
that
now
confronts
us
is
therefore
this
if
there
is
indeed
one
power
directing
all
subversive
movements
is
it
one
of
the
five
movements
here
enumerated
or
is
it
yet
another
power
more
potent
and
more
invisible
in
order
to
discover
this
it
is
necessary
to
consider
whether
these
movements
although
apparently
divergent
in
their
ultimate
purpose
have
nevertheless
any
ideas
or
any
aims
in
common
one
fundamental
point
of
similarity
will
certainly
be
found
between
them
all
desire
to
dominate
the
world
and
to
direct
it
along
lines
and
according
to
rules
of
their
own
devising
more
than
this
each
desires
to
direct
it
solely
for
the
benefit
of
one
class
of
people
social
intellectual
or
national
as
the
case
may
be
to
the
entire
exclusion
of
every
human
being
outside
that
class
thus
in
reality
each
aspires
to
the
dictatorship
of
the
world
besides
this
it
will
be
noticed
that
not
only
these
principal
movements
but
also
the
minor
subversive
movements
described
in
the
last
chapter
have
in
the
main
a
tendency
none
at
any
rate
are
nor
do
they
encourage
british
patriotism
all
contain
a
jewish
element
none
at
least
are
and
all
have
a
more
or
less
decided
antagonism
to
christianity
if
then
there
is
a
single
power
behind
them
is
it
the
power
is
it
the
jewish
power
or
is
it
the
power
let
us
examine
each
of
these
possibilities
in
turn
viewed
under
the
aspect
of
exaggerated
nationalism
the
spirit
of
is
nothing
new
the
dream
of
has
haunted
the
imagination
of
many
races
from
the
time
of
alexander
the
great
to
napoleon
i
but
nowhere
has
the
plan
been
carried
out
by
the
machiavellian
methods
which
have
characterized
prussian
foreign
policy
and
diplomacy
from
the
days
of
frederick
the
great
onwards
it
is
not
prussian
militarism
that
constitutes
the
crime
of
modern
germany
militarism
in
the
sense
of
courage
patriotism
discipline
and
devotion
to
duty
is
a
splendid
thing
but
the
spirit
of
differs
from
the
british
conception
of
patriotism
in
that
it
overrides
the
rights
of
all
other
peoples
and
seeks
to
establish
its
domination
over
the
whole
world
under
german
domination
every
german
would
be
free
and
every
other
human
being
a
slave
england
whilst
seeking
conquests
has
on
the
other
hand
always
allowed
the
inhabitants
of
conquered
territories
to
develop
along
their
own
lines
and
has
made
use
of
legislation
largely
to
protect
them
from
each
other
the
preference
of
the
native
of
india
for
an
english
judge
to
one
of
his
own
race
is
evidence
of
this
fact
but
it
is
further
the
abandonment
of
all
principle
the
acceptance
of
the
doctrine
that
everything
is
allowable
lying
treachery
calumny
and
bad
faith
in
order
to
achieve
its
end
that
has
placed
germany
outside
the
comity
of
nations
robison
describes
the
system
of
the
illuminati
as
leading
to
the
conclusion
that
nothing
would
be
scrupled
at
if
it
could
be
made
appear
that
the
order
would
derive
advantage
from
it
because
the
great
object
of
the
order
was
held
as
superior
to
every
consideration
change
the
word
order
to
state
and
one
has
the
whole
principle
of
modern
german
imperialism
now
it
is
interesting
to
notice
that
the
founders
of
german
illuminism
and
of
german
imperialism
drew
certain
of
their
ideas
from
the
same
source
both
weishaupt
and
frederick
the
great
were
earnest
students
of
machiavelli
and
both
their
master
this
form
of
machiavellism
carried
to
a
point
probably
never
dreamt
of
by
the
italian
philosopher
has
run
through
the
whole
struggle
of
prussia
for
supremacy
and
at
the
same
time
through
each
outbreak
of
world
revolution
in
which
prussian
influence
has
played
a
part
thus
the
ems
telegram
in
the
false
report
that
tricked
russia
into
mobilization
in
the
violation
of
treaties
and
of
all
the
laws
of
civilised
warfare
during
the
recent
war
were
the
direct
outcome
of
doctrines
that
may
be
found
in
embryo
in
so
also
the
most
striking
characteristic
of
the
french
revolution
under
the
inspiration
of
weishaupt
emissaries
and
the
agents
of
prussia
and
of
the
present
revolutionary
movement
inaugurated
by
karl
marx
and
friedrich
engels
is
not
so
much
its
violence
as
its
machiavellian
cunning
the
art
popularly
known
as
of
one
design
under
the
guise
of
something
quite
different
of
making
black
appear
white
by
glorifying
the
most
ignoble
actions
of
making
white
appear
black
by
holding
up
all
honourable
traditions
to
contempt
and
ridicule
in
a
word
has
been
reduced
to
a
system
by
the
secret
directors
of
world
revolution
it
is
here
that
we
can
detect
the
character
of
the
movement
the
of
all
countries
is
the
least
machiavellian
of
beings
his
weakness
lies
in
the
fact
that
he
is
too
inarticulate
that
he
does
not
know
how
to
put
his
case
even
when
he
has
a
good
one
still
less
to
make
a
bad
one
appear
plausible
it
was
not
until
world
revolution
was
taken
over
by
the
faction
described
by
bakunin
as
the
company
that
it
reassumed
its
machiavellian
character
and
gradually
became
the
formidable
organization
it
is
a
few
extracts
from
will
show
how
closely
both
the
prussians
and
the
terrorists
of
france
and
russia
have
followed
machiavelli
manual
for
despots
he
who
usurps
the
government
of
any
state
is
to
execute
and
put
in
practice
all
the
cruelties
which
he
thinks
material
at
once
that
he
may
have
no
occasion
to
renew
them
often
etc
vide
the
german
principle
of
frightfulness
to
be
exercised
against
the
inhabitants
of
invaded
territory
and
the
plan
of
the
french
and
russian
terrorists
in
suppressing
it
is
of
such
importance
to
a
prince
to
take
upon
him
the
nature
and
disposition
of
a
beast
of
all
the
whole
flock
he
ought
to
imitate
the
lion
and
the
fox
vide
frederick
the
great
and
the
demagogues
of
france
and
russia
a
prince
who
is
wise
and
prudent
can
not
or
ought
not
to
keep
his
parole
when
the
keeping
of
it
is
to
his
prejudice
and
the
causes
for
which
he
promised
removed
vide
germany
doctrine
of
the
scrap
of
paper
and
the
promises
of
the
bolshevist
trade
delegation
in
london
to
refrain
from
propaganda
because
the
whole
multitude
which
submits
to
your
government
is
not
capable
of
being
armed
if
you
be
beneficial
and
obliging
to
those
you
do

make

bolder
with
the
rest
for
the
difference
of
your
behaviour
to
the
soldier
binds
him
more
firmly
to
your
service
etc
vide
the
insolent
behaviour
permitted
to
officers
of
the
german
imperial
army
and
the
feeding
of
the
red
army
in
russia
at
the
expense
of
the
rest
of
the
population
the
prince
is
obliged
at
convenient
times
in
the
year
to
entertain
the
people
by
feastings
and
plays
and
spectacles
of
recreation
and
give
them
some
instance
of
his
humanity
and
magnificence
vide
the
important
part
played
by
spectacles
in
the
french
revolution
and
by
the
theatre
and
opera
in
soviet
russia
always
the
same
plan
of
ei
just
after
the
fall
of
napoleon
i
a
french
writer
published
a
book
describing
the
methodic
perversity
of
the
revolutionary
leaders
and
the
revolution
as
the
beginning
of
a
machiavellian
régime
how
did
this
system
come
to
be
established
in
france
unless
under
the
guidance
of
weishaupt
emissaries
and
the
agents
of
frederick
the
great
and
of
the
illuminatus
frederick
william
ii
germany
was
well
able
however
to
defend
herself
against
the
devastating
doctrines
of
illuminism
always
the
home
of
secret
societies
she
became
by
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
spiritual
home
of
socialism
yet
although
this
might
appear
to
present
a
danger
to
german
imperialism
no
country
has
remained
so
free
as
germany
from
serious
agitation
it
has
been
well
said
that
the
germans
are
theoretically
more
socialistic
than
other
nations
but
they
are
far
less
revolutionary
the
truth
is
that
the
rulers
of
germany
have
always
known
that
they
could
count
not
merely
on
the
servility
of
the
people
but
on
their
ardent
national
spirit
a
strong
vein
of
patriotism
ran
through
all
the
secret
societies
even
of
the
most
subversive
variety
and
it
was
the
german
student
orders
whence
the
illuminati
drew
their
disciples
that
became
also
the
for
the
german
imperialist
idea
instead
of
combating
subversive
forces
german
imperialism
adopted
the
far
more
skilful
expedient
of
enlisting
them
in
its
service
it
was
thus
that
in
germany
freemasonry
became
a
powerful
aid
to
prussian
aggrandizement
from
onwards
the
word
of
command
to
all
the
lodges
went
out
from
berlin
and
in
the
revolution
of
the
freemasons
of
germany
showed
themselves
the
most
ardent
supporters
of
german
unity
under
the
ægis
of
prussia
later
bismarck
with
superb
ingenuity
enlisted
not
only
freemasons
and
members
of
secret
societies
but
socialists
and
democrats
in
the
same
cause
lassalle
and
marx
contributed
powerfully
to
the
cause
of
dammer
who
succeeded
lassalle
as
head
of
the
socialist
party
instructed
his
successor
fritsche
that
in
the
meetings
which
took
place
in
saxony
whilst
putting
forward
socialist
claims
they
must
not
fail
to
demand
the
unity
of
germany
under
the
domination
of
prussia
fritsche
was
personally
to
render
an
account
to
bismarck
of
the
results
obtained
at
these
meetings
even
as
far
afield
as
italy
bismarck
succeeded
in
imposing
the
policy
of
german
autocracy
on
men
who
were
ostensibly
marching
in
the
vanguard
of
liberty
i
believe
in
the
unity
of
germany
mazzini
wrote
to
bismarck
in
and
i
desire
it
as
i
desire
that
of
my
own
country
i
abhor
the
empire
and
supremacy
that
france
arrogates
to
herself
over
europe
before
freemasonry
everywhere
on
the
continent
helped
the
cause
of
germany
the
occult
power
preached
pacifism
and
humanitarianism
in
france
by
means
of
french
freemasonry
whilst
it
preached
patriotism
in
germany
by
means
of
german
freemasonry
so
although
throughout
the
nineteenth
century
the
rulers
of
germany
permitted
the
dissemination
of
ideas
antagonistic
to
religion
until
by
the
dawn
of
the
following
century
the
very
idea
of
god
was
rooted
out
of
the
minds
of
many
german
children
the
imperial
government
was
careful
that
nothing
should
be
allowed
to
weaken
patriotism
indeed
the
obsession
into
which
german
patriotism
became
transformed
under
the
influence
of
such
men
as
treitschke
and
bernhardi
was
no
less
than
revolutionary
socialism
fortified
by
irreligion
because
founded
on
the
law
of
force
and
the
absence
of
all
moral
scruple
it
is
thus
not
militarism
in
the
accepted
sense
that
has
rendered
germany
a
menace
to
the
world
but
the
machiavellian
plan
of
using
for
export
doctrines
sternly
repressed
within
her
own
borders
i
shall
not
enlarge
here
on
the
crime
of
the
german
imperial
staff
in
sending
lenin
and
his
fellow
bolsheviks
to
russia
because
i
have
already
dealt
at
length
with
this
question
in
a
controversy
that
appeared
in
the
two
years
ago
but
whilst
acknowledging
the
fair
and
courteous
line
of
argument
adopted
by
my
german
opponent
with
which
on
certain
points
i
found
myself
completely
in
agreement
i
was
obliged
to
recognize
that
the
bar
to
any
real
understanding
between
us
lay
in
the
impossibility
of
persuading
him
to
recognize
the
principle
that
all
means
are
not
justifiable
in
order
to
obtain
one
ends
this
is
how
he
expresses
himself
on
the
subject
if
webster
reproaches
germany
for
having
employed
seditious
propaganda
in
the
countries
of
the
allies
it
may
simply
be
brought
to
mind
that
all
is
fair
in
love
and
war
in
a
war
in
a
fight
concerning
life
and
death
one
does
not
look
at
the
weapons
which
one
takes
nor
at
the
values
which
are
destroyed
by
using
the
arms
the
only
adviser
sic
is
first
of
all
the
success
of
the
fight
the
salvation
of
independence
until
germany
abandons
this
machiavellian
doctrine
it
will
be
impossible
to
treat
her
as
a
civilized
power
but
herr
kerlen
accuses
england
of
pursuing
the
same
machiavellian
policy
of
encouraging
sedition
abroad
undoubtedly
england
did
propagate
pacifism
in
germany
and
other
enemy
countries
and
hoped
to
bring
about
a
political
revolution
that
is
to
say
a
rising
of
the
german
people
against
the
rulers
who
had
led
them
into
war
it
should
be
remembered
that
all
the
friends
of
germany
in
this
country
always
declared
that
the
german
people
did
not
want
the
war
and
were
dragged
into
it
unwillingly
by
the
military
caste
but
is
there
any
evidence
to
show
that
england
ever
attempted
to
engineer
a
social
revolution
to
undermine
morality
and
all
belief
in
ordered
government
in
a
word
to
promote
bolshevism
in
germany
or
elsewhere
herr
kerlen
cites
the
sympathy
accorded
in
this
country
to
the
kerensky
revolution
but
england
largely
through
the
influence
of
the
liberals
had
always
entertained
an
exaggerated
idea
of
tzarist
tyranny
and
honestly
sympathized
with
all
efforts
however
misguided
to
liberate
the
russian
people
further
throughout
the
war
the
tzar
and
tzarina
had
been
ceaselessly
represented
as
faithless
to
the
allies
a
story
that
we
now
know
to
have
been
an
infamous
calumny
circulated
doubtless
by
enemy
agents
this
idea
even
obtained
credence
in
conservative
circles
misled
by
false
information
on
the
situation
in
russia
one
must
have
lived
through
the
spring
of
in
london
to
realize
how
completely
not
only
the
public
but
the
authorities
were
deluded
what
else
could
be
expected
when
the
opinion
of
socialists
was
accepted
on
the
matter
i
know
from
personal
experience
that
two
of
the
most
important
government
departments
were
completely
mistaken
even
on
the
subject
of
bolshevism
with
the
result
that
measures
were
not
taken
which
might
have
checked
its
spread
into
this
country
in
a
word
then
the
essential
difference
between
the
attitude
of
germany
and
england
to
russia
was
that
whilst
england
imagined
that
the
kerensky
revolution
would
be
for
the
good
of
russia
as
well
as
for
the
advantage
of
the
allies
germany
deliberately
introduced
into
russia
what
she
knew
to
be
a
poison
always
faithful
to
the
maxim
of
et
germany
after
bringing
russia
to
ruin
has
at
last
succeeded
in
causing
dissensions
between
the
allies
this
policy
she
pursued
unremittingly
throughout
the
war
thus
whilst
on
one
hand
she
was
assuring
the
french
that
the
english
would
fight
to
the
last
breath
of
the
last
frenchman
general
ludendorff
was
instructing
the
imperial
chancellor
that
we
must
again
and
again
rub
in
the
sentence
in
kuhlmann
speech
to
the
effect
that
the
question
of
is
the
only
one
which
stands
in
the
way
of
peace
and
we
must
lay
special
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
the
english
people
are
shedding
their
blood
for
an
imperialistic
so
skilfully
was
this
propaganda
carried
on
after
the
war
had
ended
that
whilst
english
officers
returning
to
england
from
the
occupied
areas
were
declaring
that
the
friendliness
of
the
germans
convinced
them
that
germany
was
really
our
friend
and
that
we
should
have
an
entente
with
her
rather
than
with
france
french
officers
returning
to
france
said
that
the
germans
had
assured
them
that
they
were
their
best
friends
that
england
was
the
real
enemy
and
that
it
would
be
better
to
break
the
entente
and
form
an
alliance
with
germany
at
the
same
time
no
less
than
three
lines
of
propaganda
concerning
the
causes
of
the
war
were
going
out
from
germany
one
laying
all
the
blame
on
the
english
one
on
the
french
and
one
on
the
jews
and
pamphlets
embodying
these
conflicting
theories
were
despatched
broadcast
to
likely
subjects
in
the
countries
of
the
allies
the
greatest
triumph
for
imperial
germany
lay
in
her
success
in
enlisting
the
very
elements
amongst
the
allies
which
might
most
be
expected
to
oppose
her
although
there
was
no
country
in
the
world
where
monarchy
was
so
adored
militarism
so
universally
admired
where
rank
and
birth
played
so
important
a
part
and
the
working
classes
though
cared
for
so
rigidly
kept
in
subjection
germany
from
the
time
of
bismarck
onwards
has
always
been
the
spiritual
home
of
british
socialists
democrats
and
pacifists
just
as
in
france
she
has
always
found
her
principal
allies
in
the
masonic
lodges
and
this
although
the
german
socialists
and
freemasons
have
never
attempted
to
use
their
influence
in
favour
of
the
masonic
and
socialist
ideal
of
universal
brotherhood
and
but
on
the
contrary
at
every
crisis
have
thrown
in
their
lot
with
the
military
party
thus
before
the
war
whilst
french
freemasons
of
the
loge
concordia
and
the
socialists
of
the
first
internationale
were
urging
their
brothers
to
rely
on
german
socialism
to
avert
a
conflict
the
prussian
lodges
were
shouting
hoch
to
the
national
colours
and
chanting
the
praises
of
king
william
and
the
prussian
sword
and
the
german
social
democrats
were
applauding
the
cause
of
german
unity
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
before
the
recent
war
when
jaurès
assured
his
that
at
the
first
sign
of
conflict
he
had
only
to
communicate
with
berlin
in
order
to
enlist
german
socialism
in
the
interests
of
peace
yet
on
the
declaration
of
war
the
german
socialists
voted
solidly
for
war
credits
whilst
the
british
socialists
opposed
participation
in
the
war
and
even
in
some
instances
expressed
sympathy
with
germany
and
let
it
never
be
forgotten
it
was
not
socialist
germany
but
imperial
germany
that
won
the
allegiance
of
our
democrats
in
spite
of
this
betrayal
by
the
socialists
of
germany
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
have
contributed
nothing
to
the
cause
of
international
socialism
or
of
the
british
labour
party
never
until
its
accession
to
office
wavered
in
its
policy
of
publicly
advocating
the
cause
of
germany
with
the
exception
of
the
social
democratic
federation
every
socialist
body
in
this
country
has
proclaimed
sentiments
and
alone
of
all
socialist
organs
has
expressed
its
sympathy
for
the
sufferings
of
france
in
fact
any
socialist
who
dared
to
champion
the
cause
of
france
immediately
lost
his
influence
and
position
in
socialist
circles
as
to
the
had
it
been
edited
in
berlin
it
could
not
more
faithfully
have
supported
german
interests
when
alsace
lorraine
was
restored
to
france
it
published
an
article
showing
how
deeply
the
inhabitants
of
this
province
resented
being
transferred
from
the
german
empire
to
the
french
republic
when
a
general
strike
threatened
this
country
it
seized
the
opportunity
to
come
out
with
an
appeal
in
enormous
capitals
to
revise
the
versailles
treaty
in
the
matter
of
reparations
its
efforts
to
let
germany
off
altogether
have
been
as
it
itself
observed
unceasing
the
plain
fact
is
it
declared
on
december
that
these
fantastic
reparation
demands
can
not
be
met
and
that
every
payment
by
which
germany
attempts
to
meet
them
will
only
work
further
havoc
to
our
own
commerce
and
our
own
industry
we
have
urged
that
ceaselessly
for
three
years
even
the
premier
begins
to
see
that
we
were
right
that
the
interests
of
this
country
demand
the
scrapping
of
whole
bad
business
of
germany
indeed
when
the
interests
of
germany
were
concerned
this
paper
which
lenin
has
described
as
our
own
organ
but
which
might
still
more
truly
be
claimed
by
ludendorff
and
stinnes
was
quite
ready
to
throw
socialism
to
the
winds
and
plead
the
cause
of
capital
at
the
very
moment
that
it
was
advocating
the
labour
policy
of
a
capital
levy
on
all
fortunes
exceeding
in
this
country
the
waxed
almost
tearful
over
the
iniquity
of
france
in
attempting
to
touch
the
pockets
of
german
whose
profits
it
went
on
to
explain
elaborately
were
not
nearly
as
huge
as
might
appear
in
view
of
the
decline
in
the
purchasing
power
of
the
mark
the
decline
in
the
purchasing
power
of
the
pound
had
however
never
been
taken
into
account
when
assessing
the
profits
of
british
employers
of
labour
we
have
only
to
follow
point
by
point
the
policy
of
the
british
labour
party
since
the
war
to
recognize
that
whilst
the
measures
it
advocated
might
be
of
doubtful
benefit
to
the
workers
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
of
the
benefit
they
would
confer
on
germany
with
a
million
and
a
quarter
unemployed
and
large
numbers
of
the
working
classes
unable
to
find
homes
the
professed
representatives
of
labour
have
persistently
clamoured
for
the
removal
of
restrictions
on
alien
immigration
and
alien
imports
so
although
through
the
trade
unions
the
british
worker
was
to
be
rigorously
protected
against
competition
from
his
no
obstacles
were
to
be
placed
in
the
way
of
competition
by
foreign
and
frequently
underpaid
labour
that
this
glaring
betrayal
of
their
interests
should
not
have
raised
a
storm
of
resentment
amongst
the
working
classes
is
surely
evidence
that
the
marxian
doctrine
the
emancipation
of
the
working
classes
must
be
brought
about
by
the
working
classes
themselves
has
so
far
led
to
no
great
results
emerson
truly
observed
so
far
as
a
man
thinks
he
is
free
the
working
classes
can
never
be
free
until
they
learn
to
think
for
themselves
instead
of
allowing
their
thinking
to
be
done
for
them
by
the
exploiters
of
labour
the
hand
of
germany
behind
socialism
must
be
apparent
to
all
those
who
do
not
deliberately
shut
their
eyes
to
the
fact
and
it
is
significant
to
notice
that
the
nearer
socialism
approaches
to
bolshevism
the
more
marked
this
influence
becomes
thus
although
certain
socialist
groups
such
as
the
social
democratic
federation
in
england
and
the
socialist
party
in
france
have
not
become
germanized
the
avowed
communists
in
all
the
allied
countries
are
strongly
this
is
the
case
even
in
france
where
the
bolsheviks
find
fervent
supporters
in
the
group
led
by
marcel
cachin
froissart
and
longuet
grandson
of
karl
marx
the
organization
of
the
bolshevist
movement
has
indeed
throughout
owed
a
great
deal
of
its
efficiency
to
german
provided
not
only
by
the
socialist
but
by
the
monarchist
elements
in
germany
it
is
necessary
in
this
connexion
to
understand
the
dual
character
of
the
german
monarchist
party
since
the
ending
of
the
war
the
great
majority
of
its
adherents
animated
by
nothing
more
reprehensible
than
the
spirit
of
militarism
and
an
aggressive
form
of
patriotism
that
clings
to
the
old
formula
of
über
are
probably
strangers
to
any
intrigues
but
behind
this
mass
of
honest
imperialists
and
doubtless
unknown
to
a
great
number
there
lurk
those
sinister
organizations
the
secret
societies
many
of
these
as
for
example
the
ostensibly
instituted
for
the
defence
of
german
interests
on
the
russian
frontier
existed
before
the
war
indeed
there
is
little
doubt
that
they
have
continued
without
a
break
since
the
days
of
the
tugendbund
and
have
always
preserved
their
masonic
and
illuminized
character
but
since
the
beginning
of
the
great
war
and
still
more
since
the
armistice
their
numbers
have
increased
until
in
they
were
estimated
to
run
into
three
figures
moreover
as
in
the
time
of
weishaupt
bavaria
is
still
a
centre
for
intrigue
and
it
was
here
that
escherich
founded
the
sometimes
known
as
the
or
organization
escherich
with
munich
as
its
headquarters
the
orgesch
was
followed
by
the
formidable
murder
club
known
to
all
the
world
as
the
organization
c
or
consul
named
after
its
founder
the
famous
captain
ehrhardt
whose
nickname
was
herr
during
the
year
no
less
than
political
assassinations
were
reported
in
germany
and
said
to
be
the
work
of
secret
societies
amongst
the
crimes
attributed
to
the
initiative
of
organization
c
were
the
murders
of
herr
erzberger
and
the
attempt
on
the
life
of
herr
scheidemann
eighty
persons
arrested
for
complicity
in
the
murder
of
herr
rathenau
were
also
said
to
be
members
of
the
same
society
but
as
in
the
case
of
all
secret
societies
the
visible
leaders
were
not
the
real
hierarchy
behind
this
active
body
there
existed
an
inner
circle
organised
on
masonic
lines
the
druidenorden
a
name
unknown
to
the
public
and
behind
this
again
another
and
still
more
secret
circle
which
appears
to
be
nameless
it
is
these
inner
rings
which
whilst
remaining
monarchist
in
germany
work
for
other
ends
abroad
and
are
connected
with
the
movement
this
alliance
between
the
two
extremes
of
ardent
monarchism
and
revolutionary
socialism
existed
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
or
even
earlier
and
as
is
now
well
known
it
was
the
jewish
social
democrat
israel
lazarewitch
alias
helphandt
alias
parvus
who
arranged
with
the
german
general
staff
for
the
passage
of
lenin
from
switzerland
to
russia
accompanied
by
karl
radek
the
austrian
jew
deserter
and
a
number
of
other
jews
now
switzerland
has
been
for
hundreds
of
years
a
centre
of
revolutionary
and
intrigue
as
early
as
the
sixteenth
century
the
pope
writing
to
the
kings
of
france
and
spain
warned
them
that
geneva
was
un
foyer
éternel
de
révolution
and
joseph
de
maistre
quoting
this
letter
in
declared
geneva
to
be
the
metropolis
of
the
revolutionaries
whose
art
of
deception
he
describes
as
the
great
european
secret
elsewhere
a
year
earlier
he
had
referred
to
illuminism
as
the
root
of
all
the
evil
at
work
it
is
now
known
that
at
the
moment
de
maistre
wrote
these
words
an
inner
ring
of
revolutionaries
claiming
direct
descent
from
weishaupt
and
even
from
an
earlier
sect
existing
at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
profited
by
the
fall
of
napoleon
i
to
reconstruct
its
organization
and
took
up
its
headquarters
in
switzerland
with
branch
offices
in
london
and
paris
the
same
secret
ring
of
illuminati
is
believed
to
have
been
intimately
connected
with
the
organization
of
the
bolshevist
revolution
although
none
of
the
leading
bolsheviks
are
said
to
have
been
members
of
the
innermost
circle
which
is
understood
to
consist
of
men
belonging
to
the
highest
intellectual
and
financial
classes
whose
names
remained
absolutely
unknown
outside
this
absolutely
secret
ring
there
existed
however
a
circle
of
high
initiates
of
subversive
societies
drawn
from
all
over
the
world
and
belonging
to
various
nationalities
german
jewish
french
russian
and
even
japanese
this
group
which
might
be
described
as
the
active
ring
of
the
inner
circle
appears
to
have
been
in
touch
with
if
not
in
control
of
a
committee
which
met
in
switzerland
to
carry
out
the
programme
of
the
third
internationale
it
was
thus
in
switzerland
that
at
the
same
time
high
initiates
of
secret
societies
foregathered
and
that
an
active
centre
of
and
even
bolshevist
propaganda
was
established
these
germans
although
monarchists
themselves
with
the
secret
revolutionary
forces
in
stirring
up
trouble
in
the
countries
of
the
allies
at
the
same
time
the
conferences
of
the
second
internationale
attended
by
members
of
the
british
took
place
in
switzerland
and
at
one
of
these
the
berne
conference
of
the
delegates
were
entertained
by
a
mysterious
american
millionaire
john
de
kay
living
himself
in
great
style
paying
for
press
service
at
the
rate
of
francs
a
day
lavishing
money
on
the
conference
and
at
the
same
time
subsidizing
a
pacifist
and
defeatest
paper
named
it
is
impossible
then
to
ignore
the
role
of
germany
in
the
present
outbreak
of
world
revolution
in
the
british
white
paper
on
bolshevism
in
russia
we
find
it
stated
by
an
englishman
who
had
been
through
the
whole
of
the
revolution
in
that
country
that
the
germans
initiated
disturbances
in
order
to
reduce
russia
to
chaos
they
printed
masses
of
paper
money
to
finance
their
schemes
the
notes
of
which
i
possess
specimens
can
be
easily
recognized
by
a
special
mark
what
has
germany
to
say
to
all
this
simply
that
the
promotion
of
bolshevism
was
a
military
necessity
in
order
to
bring
about
the
downfall
of
her
opponents
but
that
the
propaganda
utilized
by
her
was
in
reality
of
jewish
origin
and
that
jewry
not
germany
was
the
real
author
of
world
revolution
it
is
easy
to
see
how
such
a
theory
can
be
made
to
serve
the
cause
of
for
if
germany
can
persuade
us
that
the
jews
alone
were
responsible
for
the
war
and
were
also
the
sole
authors
of
bolshevism
we
shall
naturally
be
led
to
the
conclusion
that
germany
is
after
all
innocent
of
the
crimes
attributed
to
her
and
that
our
only
safety
lies
in
forgoing
reparations
restoring
her
to
her
former
power
and
coalescing
with
her
against
a
common
enemy
we
shall
therefore
do
well
to
accept
with
extreme
caution
advice
on
the
jewish
question
emanating
from
german
sources
and
to
test
the
sincerity
of
the
spirit
in
which
it
is
offered
by
considering
the
relations
which
have
hitherto
existed
between
the
germans
and
the
jews
now
germany
has
long
been
the
home
of
modern
although
in
every
country
and
at
every
period
but
more
particularly
in
the
east
of
europe
during
the
last
century
the
jews
have
suffered
from
unpopularity
it
was
germany
that
organized
this
aversion
into
a
definite
plan
of
campaign
if
in
russia
galicia
and
poland
the
jews
have
met
with
sporadic
violence
at
the
hands
of
the
peasants
in
germany
they
have
been
systematically
held
up
by
the
authorities
to
hatred
and
contempt
luther
kant
fichte
schopenhauer
treitschke
successively
inveighed
against
the
jewish
race
jews
were
denied
admission
to
masonic
lodges
and
to
the
rank
of
officers
in
the
army
whilst
society
excluded
them
up
to
the
outbreak
of
war
yet
the
extraordinary
fact
remains
that
of
all
nations
the
germans
have
always
been
the
favourites
of
the
jews
throughout
the
whole
movement
for
the
unification
of
germany
under
the
ægis
of
prussia
jews
played
a
leading
part
and
in
the
recent
war
germany
found
in
them
some
of
her
most
valuable
allies
as
maximilian
harden
recently
pointed
out
the
services
of
the
jews
to
germany
during
the
war
were
enormous
the
patriotism
of
the
jews
was
beyond
reproach
in
many
cases
even
ludicrous
and
offensive
in
its
intensity
and
in
spite
of
harden
declares
there
is
a
strong
affinity
between
the
german
and
the
jew
to
the
ashkenazim
germany
even
more
than
palestine
has
appeared
the
land
of
promise
thus
some
years
before
the
war
professor
ludwig
geiger
leader
of
the
liberal
jews
of
berlin
denounced
zionist
sophisms
in
the
words
the
german
jew
who
has
a
voice
in
german
literature
must
as
he
has
been
accustomed
to
for
the
last
century
and
a
half
look
upon
germany
alone
as
his
fatherland
upon
the
german
language
as
his
and
the
future
of
that
nation
must
remain
the
only
one
upon
which
he
bases
his
hopes
how
are
we
to
explain
this
unrequited
devotion
simply
by
the
german
policy
of
enlisting
every
dynamic
force
in
her
service
she
has
known
how
to
use
the
jews
just
as
she
has
known
how
to
use
the
freemasons
the
illuminati
and
the
socialists
for
the
purpose
of
from
frederick
the
great
who
employed
the
jew
ephraim
to
coin
false
money
to
william
ii
who
kept
in
touch
with
rathenau
by
means
of
a
private
telephone
wire
the
rulers
of
germany
have
always
allowed
them
to
in
their
schemes
of
as
the
allies
of
bismarck
who
used
them
freely
to
fill
his
the
jews
directed
the
power
of
the
secret
societies
in
the
interests
of
germany
in
the
jew
bloechreider
acted
as
adviser
to
the
new
german
empire
as
to
the
best
method
of
wresting
indemnities
from
france
and
germany
whilst
heaping
insults
on
the
jews
nevertheless
fulfils
certain
conditions
essential
to
jewish
enterprise
unlike
england
and
france
she
has
never
allowed
herself
to
be
seriously
weakened
by
democratic
ideas
and
therefore
to
the
jews
as
to
british
believers
in
autocracy
she
represents
the
principle
of
stability
moreover
germany
as
the
home
of
militarism
offers
a
wide
field
for
jewish
speculation
we
have
only
to
couple
together
an
aphorism
of
mirabeau
with
one
of
werner
sombart
to
perceive
the
bond
of
union
between
the
two
races
thus
war
is
the
national
industry
of
prussia
and
wars
are
the
jews
harvests
as
long
ago
as
anacharsis
clootz
the
apostle
of
universal
brotherhood
and
defender
of
the
jewish
race
declared
that
if
germany
were
to
be
prevented
from
going
to
war
the
jews
must
be
persuaded
to
withdraw
their
support
from
her
military
adventures
war
could
not
begin
or
last
in
germany
without
the
activity
the
intelligence
and
the
money
of
the
jews
magazines
and
munitions
of
all
kinds
are
provided
by
hebrew
capitalists
and
all
the
subaltern
agents
of
military
provisionment
are
of
the
same
nation
we
have
only
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
our
brothers
the
rabbis
to
produce
astonishing
miraculous
results
ford
the
american
manufacturer
appears
to
have
arrived
at
much
the
same
conclusion
expressed
in
the
words
recently
attributed
to
him
we
do
need
the
league
of
nations
to
end
war
put
under
control
the
fifty
most
wealthy
jewish
financiers
who
produce
wars
for
their
own
profit
and
wars
will
cease
on
another
occasion
ford
is
reported
to
have
said
that
the
jews
who
voyaged
with
him
in
the
peace
ship
in
went
out
of
their
way
to
convince
him
of
the
direct
relations
between
the
international
jew
and
the
war
they
went
into
details
to
tell
me
the
means
by
which
the
jews
controlled
the
war
how
they
had
the
money
how
they
had
cornered
all
the
basic
materials
needed
to
fight
the
war
etc
without
in
any
way
absolving
germany
from
the
crime
of
the
war
it
is
necessary
to
take
this
secondary
factor
into
consideration
if
peace
between
the
nations
is
to
be
established
for
as
long
as
the
lust
of
war
lingers
in
the
hearts
of
the
germans
and
the
lust
of
gain
at
the
price
of
human
suffering
lingers
in
the
hearts
of
the
jews
both
races
will
remain
necessary
to
each
other
and
the
hideous
nightmare
of
war
will
continue
to
brood
over
the
world
there
is
then
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
the
socialist
phrase
capitalists
wars
although
not
in
the
sense
they
attribute
to
it
for
it
will
be
noticed
that
the
capitalists
who
are
most
instrumental
in
making
wars
are
precisely
those
whom
the
socialists
are
always
careful
to
shield
from
blame
the
following
incident
will
illustrate
this
point
at
a
meeting
of
the
social
democratic
federation
adolphe
smith
moved
a
resolution
appealing
to
the
organized
workers
of
great
britain
not
to
permit
themselves
in
the
supposed
interests
of
their
in
other
countries
to
be
used
by
sinister
financial
and
militarist
influences
merely
to
weaken
the
entente
nations
in
the
present
critical
situation
and
urging
them
to
keep
careful
watch
against
such
manoeuvres
on
the
part
of
international
financiers
who
were
able
to
exercise
considerable
reactionary
influence
among
the
wealthy
and
official
classes
in
this
country
hyndman
added
that
the
most
serious
danger
by
which
we
were
threatened
was
from
the
most
powerful
group
of
capitalists
in
europe
headed
by
hugo
stinnes
and
backed
by
hindenburg
ludendorff
and
the
militarist
party
in
germany
this
resolution
was
opposed
by
a
member
of
the
parliamentary
labour
party
and
eventually
withdrawn
the
connexion
between
german
imperialism
international
finance
illuminism
bolshevism
and
certain
sections
of
british
socialism
is
thus
apparent
is
germany
then
the
secret
power
behind
the
thing
we
call
bolshevism
are
illuminism
and
one
and
the
same
thing
to
this
hypothesis
two
objections
present
themselves
firstly
that
the
spirit
of
illuminism
and
bolshevism
existed
as
we
have
seen
in
earlier
chapters
of
this
book
long
before
modern
germany
came
into
existence
and
secondly
that
germany
herself
is
not
entirely
free
from
the
contagion
for
although
the
danger
of
bolshevism
in
germany
has
been
doubtless
greatly
exaggerated
in
order
to
prevent
the
allies
from
pressing
their
demands
for
disarmament
and
reparations
nevertheless
bolshevism
under
its
illuminated
name
of
spartacism
can
not
be
regarded
as
a
movement
entirely
staged
for
the
deception
of
europe
moreover
just
as
in
the
countries
of
the
allies
it
has
shown
itself
under
the
guise
of
pacifism
savagely
and
so
in
germany
as
also
in
hungary
it
turned
pacifism
to
the
opposite
purpose
by
professing
sympathy
at
moments
with
the
allies
it
is
clear
then
that
besides
there
is
another
power
at
work
a
power
far
older
that
seeks
to
destroy
all
national
spirit
all
ordered
government
in
every
country
germany
included
what
is
this
power
a
large
body
of
opinion
replies
the
jewish
power
the
real
jewish
peril
in
considering
the
immense
problem
of
the
jewish
power
perhaps
the
most
important
problem
with
which
the
modern
world
is
confronted
it
is
necessary
to
divest
oneself
of
all
prejudices
and
to
enquire
in
a
spirit
of
scientific
detachment
whether
any
definite
proof
exists
that
a
concerted
attempt
is
being
made
by
jewry
to
achieve
and
to
obliterate
the
christian
faith
that
such
a
purpose
has
existed
amongst
the
jews
in
the
past
has
been
shown
throughout
the
earlier
chapters
of
this
book
the
conception
of
the
jews
as
the
chosen
people
who
must
eventually
rule
the
world
forms
indeed
the
basis
of
rabbinical
judaism
it
is
customary
in
this
country
to
say
that
we
should
respect
the
jewish
religion
and
this
would
certainly
be
our
duty
were
the
jewish
religion
founded
as
is
popularly
supposed
solely
on
the
old
testament
for
although
we
do
not
consider
ourselves
bound
to
observe
the
ritual
of
the
pentateuch
we
find
no
fault
with
the
jews
for
carrying
out
what
they
conceive
to
be
their
religious
duties
moreover
although
the
old
testament
depicts
the
jews
as
a
favoured
race
a
conception
which
we
believe
to
have
been
superseded
by
the
christian
dispensation
whereby
all
men
are
declared
equal
in
the
sight
of
god
nevertheless
it
does
contain
a
very
lofty
law
of
righteousness
applicable
to
all
mankind
it
is
because
of
their
universality
that
the
books
of
job
and
ecclesiastes
as
also
many
passages
in
the
psalms
in
isaiah
and
the
minor
prophets
have
made
an
undying
appeal
to
the
human
race
but
the
jewish
religion
now
takes
its
stand
on
the
talmud
rather
than
on
the
bible
the
modern
jew
one
of
its
latest
jewish
translators
observes
is
the
product
of
the
talmud
the
talmud
itself
accords
to
the
bible
only
a
secondary
place
thus
the
talmudic
treatise
soferim
says
the
bible
is
like
water
the
mischna
is
like
wine
and
the
gemara
is
like
spiced
wine
now
the
talmud
is
not
a
law
of
righteousness
for
all
mankind
but
a
meticulous
code
applying
to
the
jew
alone
no
human
being
outside
the
jewish
race
could
possibly
go
to
the
talmud
for
help
or
comfort
one
might
look
through
its
pages
in
vain
for
any
such
splendid
rule
of
life
as
that
given
by
the
prophet
micah
he
hath
shewed
thee
o
man
what
is
good
and
what
doth
the
lord
require
of
thee
but
to
do
justly
and
to
love
mercy
and
to
walk
humbly
with
thy
god
in
the
talmud
on
the
contrary
as
drach
points
out
the
precepts
of
justice
of
equity
of
charity
towards
one
neighbour
are
not
only
not
applicable
with
regard
to
the
christian
but
constitute
a
crime
in
anyone
who
would
act
differently
the
talmud
expressly
forbids
one
to
save
a
from
death
to
restore
lost
goods
to
him
to
have
pity
on
him
how
far
the
talmud
has
contributed
to
the
tendencies
of
modern
judaism
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
karaites
living
in
the
south
of
russia
the
only
body
of
jews
which
takes
its
stand
on
the
bible
and
not
on
the
talmud
of
which
it
only
accepts
such
portions
as
are
in
accordance
with
bible
teaching
have
always
shown
themselves
good
subjects
of
the
russian
empire
and
have
therefore
enjoyed
equal
rights
with
the
russian
people
around
them
catherine
the
great
particularly
favoured
the
karaites
thus
even
the
jews
are
not
unanimous
in
supporting
the
talmud
indeed
as
we
have
already
seen
many
jews
have
protested
against
it
as
a
barrier
between
themselves
and
the
rest
of
the
human
race
but
it
is
in
the
cabala
still
more
than
in
the
talmud
that
the
judaic
dream
of
recurs
with
the
greatest
persistence
the
zohar
indeed
refers
to
this
as
a
explaining
that
the
feast
of
tabernacles
is
the
period
when
israel
triumphs
over
the
other
people
of
the
world
that
is
why
during
this
feast
we
seize
the
loulab
branches
of
trees
tied
together
and
carry
it
as
a
trophy
to
show
that
we
have
conquered
all
the
other
peoples
known
as
and
that
we
dominate
them
god
is
however
asked
to
accord
these
other
peoples
a
certain
share
of
blessings
so
that
occupied
with
this
share
they
shall
not
participate
nor
mingle
with
the
joy
of
israel
when
he
calls
down
blessings
from
on
high
the
situation
may
thus
be
compared
with
that
of
a
king
who
wishing
to
give
a
feast
to
his
special
friends
finds
his
house
invaded
by
importunate
governors
demanding
admittance
what
then
does
the
king
do
he
orders
the
governors
to
be
served
with
beef
and
vegetables
which
are
common
food
and
then
sits
down
to
table
with
his
friends
and
has
the
most
delicious
dishes
served
but
this
is
nothing
to
the
feasting
that
is
to
take
place
when
the
messianic
era
arrives
after
the
return
of
the
jews
from
all
nations
and
parts
of
the
world
to
palestine
the
messiah
we
are
told
in
the
talmud
will
entertain
them
at
a
gorgeous
banquet
where
they
will
be
seated
at
golden
tables
and
regaled
with
wine
from
adam
the
first
course
is
to
consist
of
a
roasted
ox
named
behemoth
so
immense
that
every
day
it
eats
up
the
grass
upon
a
thousand
hills
the
second
of
a
monstrous
fish
leviathan
the
third
of
a
female
leviathan
boiled
and
pickled
the
fourth
of
a
gigantic
roast
fowl
known
as
barjuchne
of
which
the
egg
alone
was
so
enormous
that
when
it
fell
out
of
the
nest
it
crushed
three
hundred
tall
cedars
and
the
white
overflowed
threescore
villages
this
course
is
to
be
followed
up
by
the
most
splendid
and
pompous
dessert
that
can
be
procured
including
fruit
from
the
tree
of
life
and
the
pomegranates
of
eden
which
are
preserved
for
the
just
at
the
end
of
the
banquet
god
will
entertain
the
company
at
a
ball
he
himself
will
sit
in
the
midst
of
them
and
everyone
will
point
him
out
with
his
finger
saying
behold
this
is
our
god
we
have
waited
for
him
we
will
be
glad
and
rejoice
in
his
salvation
the
commentator
whose
summary
of
these
passages
we
quote
goes
on
to
observe
but
let
us
see
a
little
after
what
manner
the
jews
are
to
live
in
their
ancient
country
under
the
administration
of
the
messiah
in
the
first
place
the
strange
nations
which
they
shall
suffer
to
live
shall
build
them
houses
and
cities
till
them
ground
and
plant
them
vineyards
and
all
this
without
so
much
as
looking
for
any
reward
of
their
labour
these
surviving
nations
will
likewise
voluntarily
offer
them
all
their
wealth
and
furniture
and
princes
and
nobles
shall
attend
them
and
be
ready
at
their
nod
to
pay
them
all
manner
of
obedience
while
they
themselves
shall
be
surrounded
with
grandeur
and
pleasure
appearing
abroad
in
apparel
glittering
with
jewels
like
priests
of
the
unction
consecrated
to
god
in
a
word
the
felicity
of
this
holy
nation
in
the
times
of
the
messiah
will
be
such
that
the
exalted
condition
of
it
can
not
enter
into
the
conception
of
man
much
less
can
it
be
couched
in
human
expression
this
is
what
the
rabbis
say
of
it
but
the
intelligent
reader
will
doubtless
pronounce
it
the
paradise
of
fools
it
is
interesting
to
notice
that
this
conception
of
the
manner
in
which
the
return
to
palestine
is
to
be
carried
out
has
descended
to
certain
of
the
modern
colonists
sir
george
adam
smith
after
watching
zionism
at
work
in
wrote
on
visiting
a
recently
established
jewish
colony
in
the
of
the
land
round
which
a
high
wall
had
been
built
by
the
munificent
patron
i
found
the
colonists
sitting
in
its
shade
gambling
away
the
morning
while
groups
of
at
a
poor
wage
did
the
cultivation
for
them
i
said
that
this
was
surely
not
the
intention
of
their
patron
in
helping
them
to
settle
on
land
of
their
own
a
jew
replied
to
me
in
german
is
it
not
written
the
sons
of
the
alien
shall
be
your
ploughmen
and
vinedressers
i
know
that
such
delinquencies
have
become
the
exception
in
jewish
colonization
of
palestine
but
they
are
symptomatic
of
dangers
which
will
have
to
be
guarded
against
the
fellahin
may
however
consider
themselves
lucky
to
be
allowed
to
live
at
all
for
according
to
several
passages
in
the
cabala
all
the
are
to
be
swept
off
the
face
of
the
earth
when
israel
comes
into
its
own
thus
the
zohar
relates
that
the
messiah
will
declare
war
on
the
whole
world
and
all
the
kings
of
the
world
will
end
by
declaring
war
on
the
messiah
but
the
holy
one
blessed
be
he
will
display
his
force
and
exterminate
them
from
the
world
then
happy
will
be
the
lot
of
israel
whom
the
holy
one
blessed
be
he
has
chosen
from
amongst
the
of
whom
the
scriptures
say
their
work
is
but
vanity
it
is
an
illusion
at
which
we
must
laugh
they
will
all
perish
when
god
visits
them
in
his
wrath
at
the
moment
when
the
holy
one
blessed
be
he
will
exterminate
all
the
of
the
world
israel
alone
will
subsist
even
as
it
is
written
the
lord
alone
will
appear
great
on
that
day
the
hope
of
is
therefore
not
an
idea
attributed
to
the
jews
by
but
a
very
real
and
essential
part
of
their
traditions
what
then
of
their
attitude
to
christianity
in
the
past
we
have
already
seen
that
hatred
of
the
person
and
teaching
of
christ
did
not
end
at
golgotha
but
was
kept
alive
by
the
rabbis
and
perpetuated
in
the
talmud
and
the
toledot
yeshu
the
cabala
also
contains
passages
referring
both
to
christ
and
to
mohammed
so
unspeakably
foul
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
quote
them
here
but
it
will
be
urged
the
jews
of
western
europe
know
nothing
of
the
cabala
this
may
be
so
yet
imperceptibly
the
cabala
has
moulded
the
mind
of
the
jew
as
a
modern
jewish
writer
has
declared
kabbalism
has
contributed
to
the
formation
of
modern
judaism
for
without
the
influence
of
the
kabbala
judaism
might
have
been
lacking
in
warmth
and
imagination
indeed
so
deeply
has
it
penetrated
into
the
body
of
the
faith
that
many
ideas
and
prayers
are
now
immovably
rooted
in
the
general
body
of
orthodox
doctrine
and
practice
this
element
has
not
only
become
incorporated
but
it
has
fixed
its
hold
on
the
affections
of
the
jews
and
can
not
be
eradicated
it
is
thus
not
in
the
law
of
moses
thundered
from
sinai
not
in
the
dry
ritual
of
the
talmud
but
in
the
stupendous
imaginings
of
the
cabala
that
the
real
dreams
and
aspirations
of
jewry
have
been
transmitted
through
the
ages
belief
in
the
coming
messiah
may
burn
low
but
faith
in
the
final
triumph
of
israel
over
the
other
nations
of
the
world
still
glows
in
the
hearts
of
a
race
nurtured
on
this
hope
from
time
immemorial
even
the
jew
must
unconsciously
react
to
the
promptings
of
this
vast
and
ancient
ambition
as
a
modern
french
writer
has
expressed
it
assuredly
sectarian
freethinkers
swarm
who
flatter
themselves
on
having
borrowed
nothing
from
the
synagogue
and
on
hating
equally
jehovah
and
jesus
but
the
modern
jewish
world
is
itself
also
detached
from
any
supernatural
belief
and
the
messianic
tradition
of
which
it
preserves
the
cult
reduces
itself
to
considering
the
jewish
race
as
the
veritable
messiah
some
colour
is
lent
to
this
statement
by
an
article
which
recently
appeared
in
the
jewish
press
in
which
it
is
explained
that
according
to
the
teaching
of
the
liberal
jewish
synagogue
the
beautiful
passages
in
the
chapter
of
isaiah
concerning
the
man
of
sorrows
acquainted
with
grief
usually
supposed
by
christians
to
relate
to
the
promised
messiah
are
interpreted
to
modern
jewish
youth
as
relating
to
israel
and
signifying
that
israel
sufferings
were
caused
by
the
sins
of
other
nations
who
thus
escaped
the
suffering
they
deserved
consequently
israel
has
suffered
for
the
sake
of
the
whole
world
how
this
amazing
pretension
can
be
maintained
in
view
of
the
perpetual
denunciations
of
the
israelites
throughout
the
whole
of
the
old
testament
is
difficult
to
imagine
on
their
entry
into
canaan
they
were
distinctly
told
by
moses
that
the
lord
their
god
had
not
given
them
this
good
land
on
account
of
their
righteousness
or
the
uprightness
of
their
hearts
long
afterwards
daniel
declared
that
all
israel
had
transgressed
the
law
of
god
nehemiah
showed
that
on
account
of
their
rebellion
and
disobedience
they
had
been
delivered
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
isaiah
spoke
of
the
iniquities
of
judah
in
burning
words
ah
sinful
nation
a
people
laden
with
iniquity
a
seed
of
evildoers
children
that
are
corruptors
wash
your
make
you
clean
put
away
the
evil
of
your
doings
from
before
mine
eyes
cease
to
do
evil
learn
to
do
well
etc
thus
even
the
word
of
god
itself
is
powerless
to
mitigate
the
immense
megalomania
of
the
jewish
race
it
is
doubtful
indeed
whether
by
the
majority
of
jews
the
bible
is
now
regarded
as
divinely
inspired
the
ten
commandments
which
gave
to
mankind
is
a
phrase
typical
of
the
manner
in
which
israel
now
arrogates
to
itself
the
sole
authorship
of
the
scriptures
the
deification
of
humanity
by
the
freemasons
of
the
grand
orient
finds
its
counterpart
in
the
deification
of
israel
by
the
modern
jew
it
is
here
that
we
must
surely
see
the
cause
of
much
of
the
suffering
the
jews
have
endured
in
the
past
no
one
of
course
would
justify
the
cruelty
with
which
they
have
frequently
been
treated
nevertheless
to
maintain
there
was
no
provocation
on
the
part
of
the
jews
would
be
absurd
a
race
that
has
always
considered
itself
entitled
to
occupy
a
privileged
position
amongst
the
nations
of
the
world
must
inevitably
meet
with
resentment
and
in
a
primitive
age
or
population
resentment
is
apt
to
find
a
vent
in
violence
shocking
to
the
civilized
mind
moreover
to
represent
the
jews
as
a
gentle
people
always
the
victims
but
never
the
perpetrators
of
violence
is
absolutely
contrary
to
historic
fact
in
the
dark
ages
of
the
past
the
jews
showed
themselves
perfectly
capable
of
cruelties
not
only
towards
other
races
but
towards
each
other
one
of
the
first
pogroms
recorded
in
the
christian
era
was
carried
out
by
the
jews
themselves
the
jewish
historian
josephus
describes
the
reign
of
lawlessness
and
barbarity
that
was
inaugurated
about
the
middle
of
the
first
century
by
the
band
of
assassins
known
as
the
sicarii
who
infested
the
country
round
jerusalem
and
by
means
of
little
daggers
that
they
wore
concealed
beneath
their
garments
slew
men
in
the
daytime
and
in
the
midst
of
the
city
especially
at
the
festivals
when
they
mixed
with
the
multitude
during
one
night
raid
on
the
small
town
of
engaddi
they
massacred
more
than
seven
hundred
women
and
children
and
josephus
goes
on
to
say
somehow
indeed
that
was
a
time
most
fertile
in
all
manner
of
wicked
practices
among
the
jews
insomuch
that
no
kind
of
villainy
was
then
left
undone
nor
could
anyone
so
much
as
devise
any
bad
thing
that
was
new
if
he
wished
so
deeply
were
they
all
infected
both
privately
and
publicly
and
vied
with
one
another
who
should
run
the
greatest
lengths
in
impiety
towards
god
and
in
unjust
actions
towards
their
neighbours
men
in
power
oppressing
the
multitude
and
the
multitude
earnestly
endeavouring
to
destroy
men
in
power
it
is
futile
then
to
maintain
as
do
the
jews
and
their
friends
for
the
is
frequently
royaliste
que
le
that
all
the
faults
of
the
modern
jew
are
to
be
attributed
to
bitterness
engendered
by
persecution
judaism
has
always
contained
an
element
of
cruelty
which
finds
expression
in
the
talmud
it
is
from
the
talmud
not
from
the
mosaic
law
that
the
inhuman
methods
of
jewish
slaughtering
are
derived
the
talmud
likewise
gives
the
most
horrible
directions
for
carrying
out
capital
punishment
particularly
with
regard
to
women
by
the
methods
of
stoning
burning
choking
or
slaying
with
the
sword
the
victim
condemned
to
be
burnt
is
to
have
a
scarf
wound
round
his
neck
the
two
ends
pulled
tightly
by
the
executioners
whilst
his
mouth
is
forced
open
with
pincers
and
a
lighted
string
thrust
into
it
so
that
it
flows
down
through
his
inwards
and
shrinks
his
entrails
it
will
be
said
that
all
this
belongs
to
the
past
true
the
practice
here
described
may
be
considered
obsolete
but
the
spirit
of
cruelty
and
intolerance
that
dictated
it
is
still
alive
one
has
only
to
study
the
modern
jewish
press
to
realize
the
persecution
to
which
jews
are
subjected
from
members
of
their
own
race
should
they
infringe
one
fraction
of
the
jewish
code
if
then
the
modern
jew
is
the
product
of
the
talmud
it
is
here
that
we
must
see
the
principal
obstacle
to
jewish
progress
it
is
said
that
isaac
disraeli
the
father
of
lord
beaconsfield
gave
as
his
reason
for
withdrawing
from
the
synagogue
that
rabbinical
judaism
with
its
unyielding
laws
and
fettering
customs
cuts
off
the
jews
from
the
great
family
of
mankind
such
a
system
is
indeed
absolutely
incompatible
not
only
with
christian
teaching
but
with
the
secular
ideas
of
western
civilization
the
attitude
it
adopts
towards
women
would
be
in
itself
sufficient
to
justify
this
assertion
the
jewish
daily
prayer
blessed
be
thou
o
lord
our
god
king
of
the
universe
that
thou
has
not
made
me
a
woman
is
a
ludicrous
anachronism
in
the
present
age
according
to
the
talmud
a
service
can
take
place
in
the
synagogue
only
if
ten
persons
are
present
which
number
ensures
the
presence
of
god
in
the
assembly
drach
explains
however
that
these
persons
must
all
be
men
if
then
there
were
nine
men
and
a
million
women
there
could
be
no
assembly
for
the
reason
that
women
are
nothing
but
there
arrives
on
the
scene
only
one
small
boy
of
thirteen
years
and
a
day
at
once
there
can
be
a
holy
assembly
and
according
to
our
doctors
it
is
permitted
to
god
to
be
present
when
therefore
we
say
that
we
must
respect
the
jewish
religion
we
can
not
if
we
know
anything
about
it
mean
that
we
respect
that
portion
of
it
which
is
founded
on
the
rabbinical
traditions
of
the
talmud
and
the
cabala
but
only
that
ethical
law
set
forth
in
the
old
testament
to
which
jews
have
faithfully
adhered
and
which
is
largely
in
accord
with
christian
teaching
let
us
not
forget
that
rabbinical
judaism
is
the
declared
and
implacable
enemy
of
christianity
hatred
of
christianity
and
of
the
person
of
christ
is
not
a
matter
of
remote
history
nor
can
it
be
regarded
as
the
result
of
persecution
it
forms
an
integral
part
of
rabbinical
tradition
which
originated
before
any
persecution
of
the
jews
by
christians
had
taken
place
and
has
continued
in
our
country
long
after
all
such
persecution
has
ended
it
is
here
that
we
can
not
fail
to
detect
the
origin
of
much
of
that
virulent
teaching
that
is
being
disseminated
in
our
midst
this
teaching
will
be
observed
to
follow
three
lines
of
which
the
course
has
been
traced
throughout
this
book
these
consist
in
desecrating
the
christian
tradition
by
declaring
that
christ
was
either
a
myth
a
purely
human
teacher
endowed
with
superior
virtue
and
knowledge
of
natural
laws
a
crazy
fanatic
or
a
malefactor
the
first
two
theories
are
as
we
have
seen
those
held
by
secret
societies
the
last
is
essentially
jewish
it
is
true
that
there
is
now
a
movement
amongst
the
more
enlightened
jews
to
recognize
jesus
as
a
great
teacher
so
far
unfortunately
this
is
met
by
bitter
hostility
from
the
rest
and
in
the
current
jewish
press
contemptuous
and
even
blasphemous
references
to
christ
and
the
christian
faith
frequently
occur
the
fact
that
here
in
england
for
nearly
three
hundred
years
the
jews
have
been
allowed
to
dwell
in
peace
and
carry
out
their
religious
rites
unmolested
that
they
have
been
admitted
to
society
to
masonic
lodges
and
to
all
offices
of
state
and
have
met
with
increasing
tolerance
and
favour
has
done
nothing
to
moderate
that
hatred
of
christianity
inculcated
throughout
nineteen
centuries
of
rabbinical
teaching
thus
for
example
under
the
heading
of
what
christianity
has
meant
we
read
in
a
modern
jewish
periodical
we
are
thinking
of
what
christianity
as
an
institution
has
meant
to
us
jews
the
twenty
centuries
of
its
existence
have
been
coeval
with
the
tragedy
of
the
jew
dispersal
among
the
nations
what
kindliness
and
consideration
we
have
received
at
the
hands
of
christianity
has
for
the
most
part
been
tendered
with
the
lure
of
the
baptismal
font
to
the
extent
to
which
christianity
embodiment
the
church
has
been
puissant
has
the
jewish
tragedy
deepened
only
when
and
where
the
church
has
been
weak
has
life
been
tolerable
for
the
jew
hatred
of
the
jew
outbursts
and
campaigns
are
traceable
to
nothing
so
surely
as
to
antipathy
to
the
jew
which
has
been
inbred
by
christianity
there
is
thus
precious
little
about
which
the
jew
has
for
rejoicing
and
gladness
in
the
institution
of
christianity
etc
the
most
cursory
study
of
history
would
reveal
the
falseness
of
this
contention
antipathy
to
the
jew
began
long
before
the
christian
era
in
egypt
persia
and
rome
he
became
whether
just
or
not
the
object
of
suspicion
to
rulers
the
reason
given
by
pharaoh
for
oppressing
the
israelites
was
that
if
they
were
allowed
to
grow
too
powerful
they
might
join
themselves
to
the
enemy
in
time
of
war
the
emperors
of
rome
regarded
them
as
a
turbulent
element
mohammed
declared
their
aim
will
be
to
abet
disorder
on
the
earth
but
god
loveth
not
the
abettors
of
disorder
meanwhile
the
antipathy
shown
by
the
people
in
every
country
was
mainly
based
on
economic
grounds
it
was
not
simply
the
possession
of
wealth
which
according
to
the
socialist
creed
should
justify
any
amount
of
hatred
but
the
manner
in
which
it
was
acquired
and
the
arrogance
with
which
it
was
displayed
that
roused
popular
feeling
against
the
jews
an
arab
fakih
abu
ishak
of
elvira
thus
warned
his
master
of
the
growing
power
of
the
jews
in
spain
in
the
middle
of
the
eleventh
century
the
jews
contemptible
outcasts
have
become
great
lords
and
their
pride
and
arrogance
know
no
bounds
take
not
such
men
for
thy
ministers
but
abandon
them
to
curses
for
the
whole
earth
crieth
out
against
them
ere
long
it
will
quake
and
we
shall
all
perish
turn
thine
eyes
to
other
lands
and
behold
how
the
jews
are
treated
as
dogs
and
kept
apart
i
came
to
granada
and
there
i
beheld
the
jews
reigning
they
had
parcelled
out
the
provinces
and
the
capital
between
them
everywhere
one
of
these
accursed
ruled
they
collected
the
taxes
they
made
good
cheer
they
were
sumptuously
clad
while
your
garments
o
moslems
were
old
and
all
the
secrets
of
state
were
known
to
them
yet
is
it
folly
to
put
trust
in
traitors
while
believers
ate
the
bread
of
poverty
they
dined
delicately
in
the
palace
how
can
we
thrive
if
we
live
in
the
shade
and
the
jews
dazzle
us
with
the
glory
of
their
pride
in
mediæval
france
the
chief
cause
for
complaint
against
the
jews
is
that
of
not
working
with
their
hands
but
of
enriching
themselves
by
excessive
usury
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
strasbourg
preacher
geyler
asks
are
the
jews
above
the
christians
why
will
they
not
work
with
their
hands
practising
usury
is
not
working
it
is
exploiting
others
whilst
remaining
idle
such
quotations
as
these
might
be
multiplied
to
attribute
the
persecution
of
the
jews
to
christianity
is
therefore
ludicrous
that
in
a
less
enlightened
age
the
church
should
have
adopted
rigorous
measures
although
no
more
rigorous
than
their
own
laws
demanded
against
those
jews
who
practised
magic
and
witchcraft
must
appear
deplorable
to
the
modern
mind
but
so
must
many
other
phases
of
mediæval
life
why
then
hark
back
perpetually
to
the
past
if
the
jews
were
persecuted
in
a
less
enlightened
age
so
were
many
other
sections
of
the
community
catholics
were
persecuted
protestants
were
persecuted
men
were
placed
in
the
stocks
for
minor
offences
scolding
women
were
ducked
in
the
village
pond
but
if
all
these
cruelties
of
the
dark
ages
are
to
be
remembered
and
perpetuated
on
the
plan
of
a
tribal
what
peace
can
there
be
for
the
world
the
disastrous
results
of
this
tendency
were
seen
in
the
irish
intellectuals
nourished
from
infancy
on
the
story
of
ireland
wrongs
who
instead
of
sanely
facing
present
problems
unhinged
their
minds
by
brooding
on
historic
grievances
thereby
sealing
their
own
doom
and
plunging
their
country
into
ruin
so
too
the
enraged
feminists
harking
back
to
injustices
that
had
long
ceased
to
exist
embittered
their
lives
by
proclaiming
themselves
the
eternal
enemies
of
man
emerson
the
prophet
of
sanity
declared
the
only
ballast
i
know
is
a
respect
to
the
present
hour
it
is
for
lack
of
this
ballast
that
the
jews
have
become
victims
of
a
fanaticism
in
which
christians
from
a
mistaken
idea
of
kindness
have
frequently
encouraged
them
in
reality
nothing
is
more
cruel
than
to
encourage
in
the
minds
of
a
nervous
race
the
idea
of
persecution
true
kindness
to
the
jews
would
consist
in
urging
them
to
throw
off
memories
of
past
martyrdom
and
to
enter
healthfully
into
the
enjoyment
of
their
present
blessings
which
are
the
direct
outcome
of
christian
civilization
let
us
consider
what
christianity
has
in
reality
done
for
the
jews
if
so
much
is
to
be
said
about
the
persecutions
they
have
endured
what
of
the
extraordinary
indulgence
shown
them
as
the
result
of
christian
respect
for
the
bible
for
hundreds
of
years
christian
school
children
have
been
brought
up
on
old
testament
history
and
christian
congregations
have
listened
sympathetically
to
the
story
of
sufferings
and
hopes
of
final
restoration
all
the
support
lent
to
zionism
arose
from
this
tradition
christianity
then
so
reviled
by
the
jews
has
been
their
greatest
protection
if
christianity
goes
the
whole
theory
that
the
jews
were
once
the
chosen
people
goes
with
it
as
far
as
gentiles
are
concerned
and
the
jewish
race
divested
of
its
halo
of
divine
favour
will
have
to
be
judged
on
its
own
merits
in
our
own
country
the
chosen
people
theory
has
in
fact
been
carried
to
the
point
of
superstition
a
superstition
immensely
advantageous
to
the
jews
which
consists
in
interpreting
the
passage
of
scripture
containing
the
promise
made
to
abraham
i
will
bless
them
that
bless
thee
and
curse
them
that
curseth
thee
as
meaning
that
favour
shown
to
the
jews
who
form
merely
a
fraction
of
the
seed
of
abraham
brings
with
it
peculiar
blessings
in
reality
it
would
be
easier
to
show
by
history
that
countries
and
rulers
who
have
protected
the
jews
have
frequently
met
with
disaster
france
banished
the
jews
in
and
again
in
and
did
not
readmit
them
in
large
numbers
till
so
that
they
were
absent
throughout
the
most
glorious
period
in
french
history
the
of
louis
xiv
whilst
their
return
coincided
with
the
regency
from
which
moment
the
monarchy
of
france
may
be
said
to
have
declined
england
likewise
banished
the
jews
in
and
it
was
during
the
three
and
a
half
centuries
they
remained
in
exile
that
she
was
known
as
merrie
england
the
fact
that
their
return
in
force
in
was
followed
the
next
year
by
the
great
plague
and
the
year
after
by
the
great
fire
of
london
would
not
appear
to
indicate
that
the
jews
necessarily
bring
good
fortune
to
the
land
that
protects
them
the
truth
is
of
course
that
kindness
to
any
portion
of
the
human
race
brings
its
own
reward
in
the
form
of
moral
improvement
in
the
individual
or
nation
that
performs
it
but
no
more
benefit
attaches
to
philanthropy
when
exercised
towards
the
jew
than
towards
the
chinaman
i
would
urge
then
that
the
jewish
problem
should
be
approached
neither
in
the
spirit
of
superstitious
nor
in
the
bitter
spirit
of
but
with
a
sanity
worthy
of
an
enlightened
age
to
quote
again
the
words
of
bernard
lazare
let
us
enquire
what
part
the
jew
considering
his
spirit
his
character
the
nature
of
his
philosophy
and
his
religion
may
now
be
taking
in
revolutionary
processes
and
movements
is
there
then
any
evidence
that
there
exists
amongst
jewry
an
organized
conspiracy
having
for
its
objects
and
the
destruction
of
christianity
such
as
the
famous
of
the
elders
of
suggest
the
theory
of
a
jewish
does
not
of
course
rest
on
the
evidence
of
protocols
to
judge
by
the
pæans
of
joy
that
rang
through
the
press
after
the
publication
of
the
articles
one
would
imagine
that
with
the
refutation
of
this
one
document
the
whole
case
against
the
jews
had
collapsed
and
that
the
must
be
for
ever
silenced
but
the
arguments
of
the
jews
and
their
friends
go
further
than
this
not
only
do
they
claim
that
there
is
no
jewish
conspiracy
but
no
of
any
kind
this
contention
they
had
indeed
maintained
from
the
beginning
and
lucien
wolf
in
his
earliest
refutation
of
the
protocols
derided
the
exponents
of
the
danger
as
vehemently
as
he
derided
the
perfidious
author
of
the
jewish
peril
it
will
in
fact
always
be
noticed
that
references
to
the
illuminati
meet
with
almost
as
much
resentment
from
the
jewish
press
as
allusions
of
a
directly
character
barruel
who
refused
to
incriminate
the
jews
and
de
malet
who
never
referred
to
them
at
all
are
denounced
by
lucien
wolf
no
less
as
scaremongers
than
gougenot
des
mousseaux
or
chabauty
to
suggest
that
any
hidden
hand
has
ever
been
at
work
in
the
world
is
to
raise
immediately
a
storm
of
jewish
protest
yet
intelligent
jews
must
be
well
aware
that
whether
secret
societies
have
contributed
as
much
to
past
revolutions
as
these
writers
believed
their
existence
and
their
very
real
influence
is
not
a
matter
of
surmise
but
of
historical
fact
no
one
ever
warned
the
british
public
more
distinctly
of
the
danger
they
presented
or
of
the
role
the
jews
were
playing
in
them
than
disraeli
whose
famous
words
have
been
quoted
so
frequently
in
this
connexion
the
world
is
governed
by
very
different
personages
from
what
is
imagined
by
those
who
are
not
behind
the
scenes
what
is
this
but
a
clear
recognition
of
the
hidden
hand
why
then
is
disraeli
not
included
with
barruel
robison
de
malet
and
des
mousseaux
in
wolf
list
of
scaremongers
is
it
because
disraeli
pointed
the
moral
that
jews
being
so
dangerous
they
should
be
employed
if
then
leading
jews
persist
in
villifying
everyone
who
reiterates
the
warnings
uttered
by
so
eminent
a
member
of
their
race
it
is
inevitable
that
they
should
come
to
be
suspected
of
having
some
interest
in
suppressing
further
revelations
setting
all
such
evidence
as
the
protocols
completely
aside
let
us
examine
the
reasons
for
believing
in
the
exisence
of
a
jewish
now
we
know
for
certain
that
the
five
powers
before
referred
to
grand
orient
masonry
theosophy
international
finance
and
social
revolution
have
a
very
real
existence
and
exercise
a
very
definite
influence
on
the
affairs
of
the
world
here
we
are
not
dealing
with
hypothesis
but
with
facts
based
on
documentary
evidence
we
know
in
each
case
the
names
of
many
of
the
leaders
their
methods
of
organization
their
centres
of
direction
and
the
aims
they
are
pursuing
but
with
regard
to
the
jewish
power
we
can
not
proceed
with
the
same
certainty
we
can
not
cite
the
names
of
the
leaders
or
the
centres
of
direction
we
can
not
produce
documentary
evidence
as
to
their
methods
of
organization
or
their
final
aims
the
very
existence
of
such
a
power
in
the
sense
of
a
united
and
organized
body
of
jews
working
for
the
destruction
of
christianity
and
the
existing
social
system
is
still
a
matter
of
speculation
and
not
of
known
fact
investigations
into
the
activities
of
such
groups
as
the
poale
zion
the
jewish
bund
and
the
weltverband
or
jewish
international
union
of
socialists
might
however
throw
much
light
on
this
question
the
custom
of
printing
their
pidgin
german
known
as
yiddish
in
hebrew
characters
provides
the
jews
with
a
more
or
less
secret
code
by
means
of
which
their
ideas
and
aspirations
are
concealed
from
the
great
mass
of
the
gentiles
whether
then
the
jewish
power
is
unified
or
not
jews
are
to
be
found
with
if
not
directing
all
the
five
powers
of
which
the
existence
is
known
thus
jews
have
long
played
a
leading
part
in
grand
orient
masonry
and
predominate
in
the
upper
degrees
as
we
have
already
seen
freemasonry
is
always
said
to
be
subversive
in
roman
catholic
countries
it
will
also
be
noticed
that
in
countries
where
freemasonry
is
subversive
jews
are
usually
less
conspicuous
in
the
revolutionary
movement
than
in
countries
where
freemasonry
is
either
or
constitutional
thus
in
france
the
masonic
peril
is
much
more
generally
recognized
than
the
jewish
peril
in
italy
the
freemasons
have
been
banned
by
mussolini
but
the
jews
are
not
regarded
by
him
as
a
particular
danger
in
portugal
it
was
the
freemasons
rather
than
the
jews
who
made
the
recent
revolutions
in
hungary
however
the
revolutionaries
were
principally
both
jews
and
freemasons
on
the
other
hand
in
england
germany
and
america
where
freemasonry
is
not
subversive
the
jewish
question
is
more
apparent
all
this
would
suggest
that
either
freemasonry
is
the
cover
under
which
the
jews
like
the
illuminati
prefer
to
work
so
that
where
the
cover
is
not
available
they
are
obliged
to
come
out
more
into
the
open
or
that
grand
orient
masonry
is
the
directing
power
which
employs
jews
as
agents
in
those
countries
where
it
can
not
work
on
its
own
account
the
preponderance
of
jews
in
the
ranks
of
aurora
has
already
been
indicated
as
also
the
influence
of
the
jewish
cabala
in
the
teaching
of
theosophy
and
rosicrucianism
but
it
is
important
that
the
latter
point
should
be
further
emphasized
in
connexion
with
the
craze
for
occultism
that
is
spreading
through
society
ragon
has
said
the
cabala
is
the
key
of
all
occult
sciences
therefore
in
this
field
of
experiment
the
gentile
must
always
be
at
a
disadvantage
with
the
jew
indeed
waite
who
certainly
can
not
be
suspected
of
goes
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
the
gift
of
ceremonial
magic
was
the
answer
of
jewry
to
christendom
as
a
to
centuries
of
persecution
it
would
be
well
if
every
gentile
who
has
been
tempted
to
dabble
in
occultism
were
to
realize
this
source
of
inspiration
the
rôle
of
jews
in
social
revolution
and
particularly
in
bolshevism
hardly
needs
comment
yet
since
the
jewish
press
has
chosen
to
deny
this
last
and
very
obvious
fact
and
still
persists
in
setting
down
to
prejudice
or
a
mere
statement
of
facts
it
may
be
well
to
quote
here
a
few
official
statements
on
the
subject
which
admit
of
no
denial
first
of
all
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
founder
and
patron
saint
of
bolshevism
was
the
jew
karl
marx
and
that
it
was
the
anarchist
bakunin
not
the
duke
of
northumberland
who
described
him
and
his
following
in
the
internationale
as
the
company
and
the
red
bureaucracy
it
was
therefore
not
surprising
that
when
the
red
bureaucracy
avowedly
founded
on
the
doctrines
of
marx
came
to
be
set
up
in
russia
it
should
have
been
largely
led
by
jews
this
is
what
the
official
british
white
paper
has
to
say
on
the
matter
from
report
from
the
netherlands
minister
at
petrograd
on
the
of
by
sir
findlay
at
christiania
to
i
consider
that
the
immediate
suppression
of
bolshevism
is
the
greatest
issue
now
before
the
world
not
even
excluding
the
war
which
is
still
raging
and
unless
as
above
stated
bolshevism
is
nipped
in
the
bud
immediately
it
is
bound
to
spread
in
one
form
or
another
over
europe
and
the
whole
world
as
it
is
organized
and
worked
by
jews
who
have
no
nationality
and
whose
one
object
is
to
destroy
for
their
own
ends
the
existing
order
of
things
alston
to
lord
curzon
quoting
statement
from
british
consul
at
ekaterinburg
january
the
bolsheviks
can
no
longer
be
described
as
a
political
party
holding
extreme
communistic
views
they
form
a
relatively
small
privileged
class
which
is
able
to
terrorize
the
rest
of
the
population
because
it
has
a
monopoly
both
of
arms
and
of
food
supplies
this
class
consists
chiefly
of
workmen
and
soldiers
and
includes
a
large
element
such
as
letts
and
esthonians
and
jews
the
latter
are
specially
numerous
in
higher
posts
lord

quoting
information
given
by
frenchman
from
petrograd
february
the
bolsheviks
comprised
chiefly
jews
and
germans
who
were
exceedingly
active
and
enterprising
the
russians
were
largely
but
were
for
the
most
part
dreamers
incapable
of
any
sustained
action
who
now
more
than
ever
before
were
unable
to
throw
off

oppressors

opportunity
of
studying

methods
it
originated
in
german
propaganda
and
was

is
being
carried
out
by
international
jews
the
germans

to
reduce

they

schemes
the
notes

which
i
possess

can
be
easily
recognized
by
a
special
mark
as
one
of
the
results
the
writer
adds
all
business
became
paralysed
shops
were
closed
jews
became
possessors
of
most
of
the
business
houses
and
horrible
scenes
of
starvation
became
common
in
the
country
districts
in
hungary
where
as
has
been
said
socialism
had
been
propagated
by
jews
in
the
masonic
lodges
the
outbreak
of
bolshevism
was
conducted
under
the
auspices
of
the
same
race
to
quote
again
an
official
document
on
this
question
the
report
on
revolutionary
activities
issued
by
a
committee
of
the
new
york
legislature
headed
by
senator
lusk
there
was
no
organized
opposition
to
bela
kun
like
lenin
he
surrounded
himself
with
commissars
having
absolute
authority
of
the
principal
commissars
were
jews
which
was
about
the
same
proportion
as
in
russia
the
most
prominent
of
these
formed
a
directorate
of
five
bela

had
charge
of
the
red
terror
and
carried
out
the
torturing
and
executing
of
the
bourgeoisie
especially
the
groups
held
as
hostages
the
and
peasants
the
same
report
publishes
a
list
of
men
prosecuted
by
the
committee
on
the
charge
of
criminal
anarchy
in
america
at
the
beginning
of
of
which
the
overwhelming
majority
are
seen
by
their
names
to
be
jewish
these
names
speak
for
themselves
and
are
published
without
comment
on
the
obvious
nationality
of
the
majority
of
the
persons
concerned
so
far
indeed
does
the
lusk
committee
appear
to
have
been
removed
from
that
nowhere
in
its
vast
report
running
to
pages
is
attention
drawn
to
the
preponderance
of
jews
concerned
in
the
revolutionary
movement
except
in
the
one
passage
on
hungary
quoted
above
the
lusk
report
must
therefore
be
regarded
as
an
absolutely
impartial
statement
of
facts
in
view
of
these
official
data
how
is
it
possible
for
the
jewish
press
to
pretend
that
a
connexion
between
jews
and
bolshevism
is
a
malicious
invention
of
the
that
all
jews
are
not
bolsheviks
and
that
all
bolsheviks
are
not
jews
is
of
course
obvious
but
that
jews
are
playing
a
preponderating
part
in
bolshevism
it
is
absurd
to
deny
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
show
that
jews
have
suffered
as
much
as
the
rest
of
the
population
in
russia
under
bolshevism
and
that
the
jewish
religion
has
met
with
the
same
hostility
as
the
christian
faith
doubtless
many
jews
have
suffered
in
russia
since
human
violence
once
allowed
to
go
unchecked
is
liable
to
express
itself
in
various
unexpected
ways
and
the
resentment
of
the
russian
proletariat
towards
the
jews
was
bound
to
break
out
under
lenin
as
under
the
tzar
again
a
campaign
against
christianity
inevitably
led
in
russia
as
in
france
to
a
campaign
against
all
forms
of
religion
and
the
jewish
bolsheviks
being
atheists
themselves
were
doubtless
as
ready
as
lambert
of
the
french
revolution
to
turn
against
the
believers
in
the
faith
they
had
abandoned
yet
that
the
jewish
religion
suffered
to
the
same
extent
as
christianity
or
that
any
organized
campaign
was
conducted
against
it
by
the
government
is
effectually
disproved
by
the
lamentations
of
professing
jews
on
the
death
of
lenin
indeed
as
is
generally
recognized
the
fall
of
the
soviet
government
must
mean
the
downfall
of
the
jews
from
the
position
of
privilege
they
now
occupy
that
in
our
own
country
jews
are
playing
a
part
in
the
background
of
bolshevism
is
again
evident
the
recently
published
a
series
of
articles
giving
inside
information
on
the
organization
of
the
revolutionary
movement
in
great
britain
where
it
was
stated
the
whole
plot
was
directed
by
a
group
of
twelve
men
this
group
in
turn
was
controlled
by
three
of
its
members
these
three
men
as
the
key
revealed
were
all
jews
so
also
was
the
fiend
in
human
form
whose
psychological
perversion
produced
this
plot
and
who
was
one
of
a
group
in
america
consisting
of
four
jews
and
a
jewess
which
controlled
an
outer
revolutionary
group
of
eighteen
the
irish
republican
brotherhood
also
maintained
close
relations
with
a
ring
of
revolutionary
jews
in
america
incidentally
it
is
curious
to
notice
that
the
language
employed
in
some
of
the
correspondence
that
has
passed
between
members
of
an
inner
group
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
that
of
weishaupt
and
his
jewish
influence
in
the
less
extreme
forms
of
socialism
in
this
country
is
no
less
apparent
if
the
labour
party
is
solidly
it
is
also
solidly
whilst
loudly
proclaiming
pacifism
and
pressing
for
the
reduction
of
armaments
it
has
never
uttered
a
word
of
protest
against
the
employment
of
british
troops
to
defend
jewish
interests
against
the
arabs
in
palestine
the
blessed
word
mesopotamia
may
be
freely
mentioned
in
connexion
with
the
withdrawal
of
troops
from
military
adventures
but
never
the
word
palestine
again
the
free
admission
of
aliens
and
particularly
of
jews
into
this
country
has
always
been
one
of
the
principal
planks
in
the
labour
platform
even
the
jewish
capitalist
meets
with
indulgence
at
the
hands
of
our
socialist
intellectuals
who
whilst
inveighing
against
british
owners
of
property
never
include
jewish
millionaires
in
their
diatribes
this
may
perhaps
throw
some
light
on
the
question
frequently
propounded
how
can
one
believe
that
jews
advocate
socialism
since
they
stand
to
lose
everything
by
it
the
fact
remains
that
many
jews
do
advocate
it
after
the
recent
accession
of
the
labour
party
to
office
the
observed
the
result
of
the
general
election
in
england
is
regarded
as
very
gratifying
by
the
hebrew
and
yiddish
press
the
hebrew
journals
in
palestine
as
well
as
the
hebrew
and
yiddish
organs
in
europe
and
america
express
satisfaction
at
the
return
to
parliament
of
men
who
have
repeatedly
assured
the
public
of
their
intention
to
adhere
to
the
balfour
declaration
a
further
reason
is
advanced
by
the
for
rejoicing
at
the
downfall
of
the
conservative
government
namely
that
the
election
results
have
wiped
out
remnants
in
england
for
the
conservative
government
does
include
several
members
who
are
far
from
favourably
disposed
towards
jews
the
indulgence
shown
to
the
jews
and
the
honours
piled
on
them
by
conservative
statesmen
therefore
availed
nothing
to
the
conservative
cause
and
the
welfare
of
the
whole
country
was
subordinated
to
the
interests
of
the
jews
alone
it
is
difficult
at
first
to
understand
how
the
programme
of
the
labour
party
even
when
combined
with
ardent
could
however
be
in
accord
with
the
interests
of
the
jews
who
have
never
displayed
any
hostility
towards
the
capitalist
system
which
socialism
sets
out
to
destroy
indeed
we
find
the
same
jewish
paper
which
rejoiced
at
the
advent
of
the
present
government
to
office
offering
birthday
congratulations
to
the
richest
jew
in
this
country
whose
wealth
it
goes
on
to
observe
with
some
complacency
amounts
to
no
less
than
sterling
and
is
constantly
increasing
apart
from
the
interest
that
it
brings
by
the
huge
profits
of
the
concerns
in
which
he
is
interested
it
would
seem
then
that
in
the
eyes
of
jewry
all
capitalists
are
not
to
be
regarded
as
monsters
who
should
be
mercilessly
expropriated
but
in
considering
the
war
on
capitalism
it
is
essential
to
bear
in
mind
that
capitalists
are
of
two
kinds
national
industrial
capitalists
largely
gentiles
and
usually
men
of
brains
and
energy
who
have
built
up
flourishing
businesses
and
international
capitalists
principally
though
not
exclusively
jews
who
live
by
speculation
whilst
to
the
former
social
unrest
may
prove
fatal
to
the
latter
any
disturbances
may
provide
opportunities
for
profit
as
georges
batault
has
well
expressed
it
from
the
strictly
financial
point
of
view
the
most
disastrous
events
of
history
wars
or
revolutions
never
represent
catastrophes
the
manipulators
of
money
and
the
wary
business
men
can
make
profit
out
of
everything
provided
they
know
beforehand
and
are
it
is
certain
that
the
jews
dispersed
over
all
the
surface
of
the
earth
are
particularly
favourably
situated
in
this
respect
it
is
significant
to
notice
that
the
capitalists
most
attacked
by
the
socialists
and
pacifists
are
not
those
who
make
profit
out
of
wars
and
revolutions
but
those
who
contribute
to
the
prosperity
of
the
country
and
provide
work
for
millions
of
people
here
then
the
jews
and
the
socialists
seem
to
find
a
point
of
agreement
it
is
evident
at
any
rate
that
many
rich
jews
consider
that
they
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
threatened
capital
levy
and
other
features
of
expropriation
are
we
not
irresistibly
reminded
of
the
passage
in
the
protocols
where
incidentally
the
capital
levy
is
specifically
mentioned
ours
they
will
not
touch
because
the
moment
of
attack
will
be
known
to
us
and
we
shall
take
measures
to
protect
our
own
but
let
us
consider
further
how
the
socialist
plan
for
the
nationalization
of
all
the
means
of
production
distribution
and
exchange
might
be
reconciled
even
with
the
interests
of
jewish
industrial
capitalists
the
more
we
examine
this
magic
formula
which
is
to
transform
the
world
into
a
paradise
for
the
workers
the
more
we
shall
see
that
it
approximates
to
the
system
of
super
capitalism
of
which
as
werner
sombart
has
shown
the
jews
were
the
principal
inaugurators
socialists
are
fond
of
explaining
that
capitalism
began
with
the
introduction
of
steam
in
reality
of
course
capitalism
in
the
sense
of
wealth
accumulated
in
private
hands
has
always
existed
since
the
first
savage
made
his
store
of
winter
food
what
socialists
really
mean
by
capitalism
is
the
modern
system
of
industrialism
which
tends
to
concentrate
all
the
means
of
production
and
distribution
in
the
hands
of
individuals
or
groups
who
if
they
happen
to
be
unscrupulous
are
able
by
systematic
sweating
of
the
worker
and
bleeding
of
the
consumer
to
conduct
operations
on
so
large
a
scale
as
to
crush
all
competition
by
the
home
worker
or
the
small
tradesman
obviously
however
with
the
growing
demand
of
the
workers
for
better
conditions
of
life
and
the
increasing
support
lent
to
them
by
enlightened
public
opinion
this
possibility
can
not
continue
indefinitely
and
unless
a
violent
convulsion
takes
place
the
time
will
come
when
great
industrial
magnates
will
have
to
content
themselves
with
moderate
profits
on
their
outlay
thus
although
at
first
sight
it
might
appear
that
the
must
desire
to
maintain
the
existing
order
of
things
if
he
is
he
must
realize
that
profiteering
under
present
conditions
must
soon
cease
it
is
therefore
conceivable
that
even
the
jewish
industrial
capitalist
may
see
in
the
nationalization
of
industry
a
preferable
alternative
to
the
limitation
of
profits
under
private
enterprise
the
same
financial
acumen
and
skill
in
management
which
has
enabled
him
to
control
rings
and
trusts
in
the
past
would
ensure
him
a
place
at
the
head
of
nationalized
industries
which
in
effect
would
be
nothing
but
gigantic
trusts
nominally
under
state
control
but
really
like
all
state
enterprises
in
the
hands
of
a
few
men
under
socialism
the
position
of
these
trusts
would
be
rendered
impregnable
for
whilst
under
the
present
system
any
individual
or
group
may
set
out
to
break
a
trust
no
such
competition
would
be
possible
in
a
state
where
private
enterprise
had
been
made
illegal
the
men
in
control
of
nationalized
industries
would
therefore
be
able
to
exercise
absolute
authority
both
over
the
worker
and
the
consumer
further
if
the
worker
can
be
persuaded
to
accept
the
ultimate
scheme
of
communism
which
is
compulsory
labour
in
return
for
no
monetary
remuneration
but
merely
a
daily
ration
of
food
and
the
other
necessaries
of
life
whenever
state
officials
decide
that
he
requires
them
the
directors
of
labour
like
the
overseers
in
a
slave
plantation
will
be
able
as
in
russia
to
impose
any
conditions
they
please
the
jews
may
well
hope
to
occupy
these
posts
not
only
because
of
their
aptitude
for
organization
on
so
large
a
scale
but
because
their
international
relations
would
facilitate
the
sale
or
barter
of
goods
between
countries
the
cohesion
which
exists
amongst
them
would
speedily
lead
to
the
monopolization
of
all
the
higher
posts
by
members
of
their
race
it
is
idle
to
dismiss
such
a
possibility
as
a
chimera
this
is
what
happened
in
russia
and
is
happening
in
germany
here
then
we
may
find
perhaps
the
inner
meaning
of
a
remark
attributed
to
a
prominent
member
of
the
labour
party
that
under
socialism
a
certain
jewish
capitalist
might
well
be
worth
a
year
lenin
expressed
much
the
same
idea
when
he
said
that
the
russian
soviet
republic
might
require
a
thousand
specialists
to
direct
the
work
of
the
people
and
that
these
greatest
must
be
paid
roubles
each
or
even
four
times
that
sum
supposing
it
were
necessary
to
employ
foreign
specialists
for
the
purpose
but
the
jewish
capitalists
doubtless
see
further
that
in
england
as
in
russia
this
condition
of
things
would
be
merely
a
temporary
phase
and
that
the
institution
of
socialism
by
dispossessing
the
present
gentile
owners
of
wealth
and
property
would
pave
the
way
for
a
jewish
and
german
plutocracy
in
russia
wealth
has
not
been
altogether
destroyed
it
has
simply
changed
hands
and
a
class
of
new
rich
has
sprung
up
which
meets
with
no
hostility
from
the
professed
advocates
of
equality
those
jews
who
see
in
the
christian
intelligentsia
the
main
obstacle
to
their
dream
of
therefore
naturally
find
in
the
promoters
of
their
most
valuable
allies
for
the
christian
intelligentsia
is
the
sole
bare
to
the
enslavement
of
the
proletariat
most
of
the
movements
to
redress
the
wrongs
of
the
workers
from
lord
shaftesbury
onwards
have
arisen
not
amongst
the
workers
themselves
but
amongst
the
upper
or
middle
classes
once
these
were
swept
away
an
iron
bureaucracy
would
have
the
workers
at
their
mercy
i
do
not
say
this
is
the
plan
but
i
do
say
that
such
a
hypothesis
provides
a
reason
for
the
otherwise
unaccountable
indulgence
displayed
by
socialists
everywhere
towards
wealthy
jews
and
at
the
same
time
for
the
huge
funds
the
socialists
appear
to
have
at
their
disposal
if
big
financiers
are
not
at
their
back
i
repeat
where
does
all
the
money
come
from
it
seems
unlikely
that
it
can
be
derived
from
the
british
owners
of
wealth
and
property
whom
the
socialists
are
openly
out
to
dispossess
the
only
body
of
financiers
which
can
therefore
be
suspected
of
contributing
towards
this
end
is
the
body
known
as
international
finance
which
is
mainly
though
not
exclusively
jewish
the
influence
of
the
jews
in
all
the
five
great
powers
at
work
in
the
world
grand
orient
masonry
theosophy
international
finance
and
social
revolution
is
not
a
matter
of
surmise
but
of
fact
let
us
now
examine
what
part
they
are
playing
in
the
minor
subversive
movements
enumerated
in
an
earlier
chapter
freud
the
inventor
of
the
most
dangerous
form
of
is
a
jew
in
this
connexion
the
eminent
american
before
quoted
writes
not
only
the
freud
theory
of
but
a
considerable
quantity
of
propaganda
of
that
type
has
for
years
been
emanating
from
a
group
of
german
jews
who
live
and
have
their
headquarters
in
vienna
from
its
inception
has
been
in
jewish
hands
there
are
not
half
a
dozen
physicians
in
the
whole
world
recognized
as
authorities
in
this
field
whose
names
are
identified
with
this
movement
who
are
not
jews
this
may
have
been
an
accident
but
nevertheless
it
is
a
fact
i
have
already
referred
in
an
earlier
chapter
to
the
question
of
degenerate
art
defined
in
a
circular
to
the
york
as
the
deification
of
ugliness
the
originators
of
this
cult
are
here
described
as
a
group
of
satan
worshippers
in
paris
and
the
dealers
by
whom
the
movement
was
propagated
as
germans
but
we
note
amongst
the
lenders
to
the
exhibition
at
which
these
works
of
art
were
displayed
several
jewish
names
of
one
jewish
artist
a
critic
has
written
were
these
works
the
product
of
a
man
who
had
imperfect
control
over
his
material
who
in
stumbling
towards
the
light
dwelt
inevitably
upon
much
darkness
who
sought
for
beauty
and
found
ugliness
who
looked
for
purity
and
found
filth
even
then
one
might
be
silent
and
hope
for
better
things
to
come
but
here
apparently
unless
my
whole
reading
is
ludicrously
wrong
he
delights
in
deformity
and
glories
in
degradation
he
brings
to
the
world
of
art
a
new
gospel
a
black
gospel
a
gospel
in
which
everything
is
to
be
inverted
and
distorted
whatsoever
things
are
hideous
whatsoever
things
are
of
evil
report
whatsoever
things
are
sordid
if
there
be
any
unhealthiness
or
any
degradation
think
on
these
things
what
better
résumé
could
be
given
of
that
tendency
to
perversion
denounced
by
the
prophet
isaiah
in
the
words
woe
unto
them
that
call
evil
good
and
good
evil
that
put
darkness
for
light
and
light
for
darkness
an
organ
of
the
jewish
press
with
that
sense
of
solidarity
which
always
rallies
jews
to
the
defence
of
their
compatriots
however
culpable
immediately
detects
in
the
critic
expression
of
opinion
the
insidious
work
of
a
more
enlightened
jew
frank
emanuel
however
having
come
to
the
support
of
the
gentile
critic
the
jewish
journal
is
obliged
to
admit
the
justice
of
his
contention
that
it
is
lamentable
to
think
of
the
undue
proportion
of
young
jews
who
have
joined
the
revolutionary
or
sham
art
movement
in
this
country
the
same
influence
will
be
noticed
in
the
cinema
world
where
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
history
is
systematically
falsified
in
the
interests
of
class
hatred
and
everything
that
can
tend
whilst
keeping
within
the
present
law
to
undermine
patriotism
or
morality
is
pressed
upon
the
public
and
the
cinema
trade
is
almost
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
jews
in
the
drug
traffic
jews
are
playing
a
prominent
part
both
here
and
in
america
an
eminent
new
york
doctor
writes
to
me
as
follows
members
of
the
federal
narcotic
squad
attached
to
the
treasury
department
and
having
the
function
of
enforcing
the
provisions
of
the
harrison
act
have
long
been
convinced
that
there
is
a
direct
relationship
between
radicalism
and
narcotism
from
seven
to
ten
years
ago
this
was
thought
to
be
a
manifestation
of
propaganda
activity
was
and
still
is
greater
on
the
part
of
the
distributors
and
pedlars
than
is
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
large
profits
according
to
their
story
curiously
enough
the
traffic
largely
stopped
for
several
weeks
following
the
signing
of
the
armistice
in
one
instance
seven
regularly
licensed
physicians
of
the
east
side
all
jews
were
arrested
in
succession
during
the
summer
of
for
illegitimate
use
of
narcotic
prescriptions
and
every
office
raided
had
large
quantities
of
radical
literature
such
associations
are
not
uncommon
as
to
the
distribution
a
recent
investigation
by
definitely
revealed
the
fact
that
the
illegitimate
distributors
were
almost
invariably
of
the
jewish
race
and
that
the
pedlars
were
exclusively
jewish
and
italian
enough
then
has
been
said
to
show
that
whether
as
agents
or
as
principals
jews
are
playing
a
part
in
all
subversive
movements
a
christian
jew
no
renegade
to
his
race
but
deeply
concerned
for
their
future
development
said
recently
to
the
present
writer
the
growing
materialism
amongst
jews
has
made
them
the
most
destructive
force
in
the
world
the
only
hope
for
them
is
to
accept
christianity
at
present
they
are
the
greatest
danger
that
christian
civilization
has
to
face
the
recognition
of
all
these
facts
does
not
of
course
imply
the
belief
that
all
jews
are
destructive
undoubtedly
there
are
good
and
loyal
jews
particularly
in
france
where
the
sephardim
predominate
who
have
absolutely
identified
themselves
with
the
country
of
their
adoption
and
are
sincerely
opposed
to
bolshevism
but
these
isolated
individuals
carry
little
weight
compared
to
the
massed
forces
of
subversive
jewry
the
same
thing
was
observed
in
america
where
a
report
privately
communicated
to
the
present
writer
in
stated
it
appears
not
without
significance
that
radical
literature
is
never
but
on
the
contrary
manifestoes
issued
by
the
executive
committee
of
the
communist
party
are
often
emphatically
so
far
as
i
know
there
is
not
one
exclusively
jewish
organization
in
the
united
states
which
is
openly
and
consistently
fighting
radicalism
conservative
judaism
loyal
to
the
united
states
and
its
institutions
as
conceived
by
its
founders
is
unorganized
and
inarticulate
when
therefore
the
jewish
press
protests
at
the
injustice
of
associating
jews
with
bolshevism
it
may
be
legitimately
answered
what
has
jewry
done
collectively
to
disassociate
itself
from
bolshevism
what
official
protests
has
the
jewish
press
uttered
against
any
subversive
movement
except
when
jewish
interests
were
threatened
has
it
not
on
the
contrary
denounced
all
patriotic
efforts
to
oppose
the
forces
of
destruction
whenever
such
efforts
necessitated
the
exposure
of
the
corrupt
elements
in
jewry
but
these
tactics
have
not
been
confined
to
the
jewish
press
alone
the
general
press
of
this
country
over
which
the
jews
exercise
an
increasing
control
has
followed
the
same
policy
this
process
of
penetration
began
long
ago
on
the
continent
as
early
as
an
english
missionary
to
the
jews
in
berlin
wrote
independently
of
the
fifteen
exclusively
jewish
journals
of
germany
four
of
which
have
made
their
appearance
since
the
beginning
of
the
present
year
the
daily
political
press
of
europe
is
very
much
under
the
dominion
of
the
jews
as
literary
contributors
they
influence
almost
every
leading
continental
newspaper
and
as
controversy
seems
to
be
their
native
air
and
they
bring
into
the
field
mental
energies
of
no
ordinary
stamp
they
find
no
lack
of
employment
and
if
any
literary
opponent
ventures
to
endeavour
to
arrest
the
progress
of
judaism
to
political
power
he
finds
himself
held
up
to
public
notice
and
exposed
to
attack
after
attack
in
most
of
the
leading
journals
of
europe
such
was
the
lot
of
a
roman
catholic
priest
of
prague
who
lately
wrote
a
pamphlet
entitled
rath
für
zeit
der
directed
against
the
advancing
power
of
judaism
and
such
is
my
conviction
of
the
extent
of
the
participation
the
jews
take
in
the
everyday
literature
of
germany
that
i
never
pass
by
a
crowded
but
what
i
think
i
see
standing
behind
the
scenes
a
jew
causing
new
ideas
to
rise
and
stir
and
develop
themselves
in
the
unsuspecting
mind
of
the
gentile
do
we
not
see
the
same
methods
being
pursued
with
still
greater
vigour
it
would
not
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
there
is
hardly
a
periodical
in
this
country
with
the
exception
of
that
dares
to
speak
out
freely
on
questions
in
which
the
interests
of
jews
are
involved
the
fact
is
that
the
whole
educational
as
well
as
the
whole
political
and
social
world
is
permeated
with
jewish
influence
every
man
in
public
life
every
modern
politician
to
whatever
party
he
belongs
seems
to
find
it
to
have
his
confidential
jewish
adviser
at
his
elbow
just
as
in
the
middle
ages
a
prince
had
his
jewish
doctor
always
at
hand
to
mix
his
potions
and
ensure
him
long
life
this
appears
to
be
owing
not
only
to
the
utility
of
the
jew
in
financing
projects
but
to
the
almost
universal
belief
in
the
superior
intelligence
of
the
jewish
race
which
the
jew
has
succeeded
in
implanting
in
the
gentile
mind
but
the
time
has
come
to
ask
is
the
jew
really
the
we
have
been
taught
to
consider
him
on
examination
we
shall
find
that
in
the
present
as
in
the
past
his
talents
are
displayed
principally
along
two
lines
financial
and
occult
usurers
in
the
middle
ages
financiers
the
jews
have
always
excelled
in
the
making
and
manipulating
of
wealth
and
just
as
at
the
former
period
they
were
the
great
masters
of
magic
so
at
the
present
time
they
are
the
masters
of
the
almost
magical
art
of
gaining
control
over
the
mind
both
of
the
individual
and
of
the
public
yet
in
the
realms
of
literature
philosophy
painting
sculpture
politics
and
even
science
jews
will
be
found
frequently
occupying
the
second
or
third
ranks
and
only
very
seldom
the
first
heine
may
be
cited
as
a
poet
of
the
first
order
spinoza
as
a
philosopher
disraeli
as
a
statesman
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
prolong
the
list
on
the
stage
and
in
music
alone
can
the
jews
be
said
to
have
proved
absolutely
the
equals
of
their
gentile
competitors
the
fact
is
that
the
jew
is
not
usually
a
man
of
vast
conceptions
nor
is
he
endowed
with
great
originality
of
mind
his
skill
consists
rather
in
elaborating
or
in
adapting
other
men
ideas
and
rendering
them
more
effectual
thus
the
most
important
inventions
of
modern
times
have
not
been
made
by
jews
but
have
been
frequently
improved
by
them
neither
james
watt
stephenson
marconi
edison
pasteur
nor
madame
curie
were
of
the
jewish
race
and
the
same
might
be
said
of
nearly
all
the
greatest
men
who
have
lived
since
the
dawn
of
our
civilization
napoleon
was
not
a
jew
nor
was
shakespeare
nor
bacon
nor
sir
isaac
newton
nor
michael
angelo
nor
leonardo
da
vinci
nor
galileo
nor
dante
nor
descartes
nor
molière
nor
emerson
nor
abraham
lincoln
nor
goethe
nor
kant
nor
even
machiavelli
thrown
on
their
own
resources
what
civilization
were
the
jews
able
to
create
whilst
egypt
greece
and
rome
have
left
immortal
monuments
what
monuments
has
palestine
bequeathed
to
the
world
the
jews
then
provide
a
high
average
of
cleverness
but
have
they
ever
during
the
last
two
thousand
years
produced
one
mighty
genius
moreover
against
this
high
average
of
intelligence
must
be
set
an
equally
high
average
of
mental
derangement
on
this
point
we
have
the
evidence
of
the
the
jews
are
more
subject
to
diseases
of
the
nervous
system
than
the
other
races
and
peoples
among
which
they
dwell
hysteria
and
neurasthenia
appear
to
be
most
frequent
some
physicians
of
large
experience
among
jews
have
even
gone
so
far
as
to
state
that
most
of
them
are
neurasthenic
and
hysterical
tobler
claims
that
all
the
jewish
women
in
palestine
are
hysterical
and
raymond
says
that
in
warsaw
poland
hysteria
is
very
frequently
met
with
among
both
jewish
men
and
jewish
women
the
jewish
population
of
that
city
alone
is
almost
exclusively
the
inexhaustible
source
for
the
supply
of
hysterical
males
for
the
clinics
of
the
whole
continent
des
maladies
du
système
nerveux
en
as
regards
austria
and
germany
the
same
neurotic
taint
of
the
jews
has
been
emphasized
by
krafft
ebbing
etc
in
new
york
it
has
been
shown
by
collins
that
among
cases
of
neurasthenia
which
came
under
his
observation
more
than
per
cent
were
of
jewish
extraction
etc
the
same
american
already
quoted
attributes
the
predominance
of
jews
in
the
revolutionary
movement
in
america
largely
to
this
cause
anarchists
have
been
developed
largely
from
the
criminal
classes
and
a
belief
in
anarchy
is
a
psychopathic
manifestation
a
student
of
anarchy
therefore
would
not
only
be
obliged
to
cover
the
field
of
criminology
but
its
more
significant
and
important
background
some
anarchists
are
actually
insane
while
others
show
marked
psychological
deficiencies
under
our
laws
as
they
are
now
framed
they
can
not
be
restrained
unless
they
commit
acts
of
violence
as
it
is
our
asylums
are
filled
with
this
class
and
that
introduces
another
phase
of
the
matter
our
asylum
insane
are
largely
recruited
from
the
jewish
race
at
least
recruited
in
tremendous
disproportion
to
their
number
in
the
population
the
fact
that
the
revolutionary
movement
is
so
largely
made
up
of
jewish
elements
furnishes
an
interesting
confirmation
of
what
i
have
said
the
recently
commenting
on
the
generally
admitted
fact
that
the
percentage
of
mental
disorders
among
jews
is
much
greater
than
among
asks
is
the
cause
inherent
that
is
to
say
is
there
a
racial
disposition
towards
degeneracy
or
is
it
the
result
of
the
external
conditions
and
causes
the
writer
goes
on
to
refer
to
an
article
in
the
which
supports
the
view
that
the
terrible
experiences
of
the
jews
in
the
middle
ages
have
affected
their
nervous
system
and
therefore
that
the
cause
of
mental
derangement
amongst
them
is
not
due
to
racial
disposition
is
not
an
ethnic
principle
but
is
the
result
of
the
tragic
lot
of
the
jewish
people
it
might
perhaps
be
traced
more
surely
to
the
habit
of
brooding
on
that
tragic
lot
at
any
rate
it
is
curious
to
notice
that
the
two
symptoms
recognized
in
the
first
stages
of
general
paralysis
of
the
insane
the
mania
that
one
is
the
object
of
persecution
and
exalted
ideas
known
in
france
as
the
des
are
the
two
obsessions
that
the
talmud
and
the
cabala
with
their
dreams
of
under
an
avenging
messiah
have
inculcated
in
the
mind
of
the
jew
but
whatever
are
the
causes
of
this
neurosis
it
is
surely
undesirable
that
a
race
which
exhibits
it
should
be
allowed
to
control
the
destinies
of
the
british
empire
or
indeed
of
any
country
if
all
the
jewish
women
in
palestine
are
hysterical
presumably
many
of
their
menkind
suffer
from
the
same
disability
which
certainly
does
not
promise
well
for
the
luckless
arab
who
is
to
live
beneath
their
sway
how
much
of
the
trouble
that
has
occurred
already
in
palestine
may
be
attributed
to
this
cause
it
is
impossible
to
know
the
increasing
number
of
jews
in
positions
of
authority
in
england
presents
however
a
far
greater
subject
for
alarm
jews
and
arabs
are
at
any
rate
both
semites
and
may
be
expected
to
have
certain
ideas
in
common
but
to
place
a
highly
civilized
aryan
race
under
semitic
control
is
another
matter
the
time
has
come
for
every
briton
to
ask
himself
whether
he
seriously
desires
to
see
the
traditions
of
his
country
those
great
traditions
of
honour
integrity
and
justice
which
have
made
the
name
of
england
great
replaced
by
oriental
standards
i
do
not
say
that
there
are
no
honourable
and
upright
jews
but
i
do
maintain
that
the
spirit
of
fair
play
which
is
the
essence
of
the
british
character
is
not
the
characteristic
of
the
jewish
race
in
general
the
complete
absence
of
this
spirit
shown
in
the
attempts
of
agitators
to
suppress
free
speech
during
elections
can
not
be
attributed
to
english
whose
sporting
instinct
is
highly
developed
and
testifies
to
the
alien
character
of
the
labour
movement
if
england
loses
the
spirit
of
fair
play
she
will
have
lost
her
most
priceless
national
heritage
conservatism
which
has
always
stood
for
these
great
traditions
allows
itself
to
be
hypnotized
by
the
memory
of
disraeli
and
accepts
his
dictum
that
the
natural
tendency
of
the
jews
is
to
conservatism
hence
the
advisability
of
placing
jews
in
control
of
its
interests
the
late
hyndman
saw
further
when
he
warned
us
that
those
who
are
accustomed
to
look
upon
all
jews
as
essentially
practical
and
conservative
as
certain
too
to
enlist
on
the
side
of
the
prevailing
social
system
will
be
obliged
to
reconsider
their
conclusions
the
causes
of
the
recent
of
the
conservative
government
are
still
obscure
but
the
fact
remains
that
it
was
precisely
at
a
moment
when
conservative
organization
had
passed
largely
into
jewish
hands
that
conservatism
met
with
the
most
astounding
disaster
in
the
whole
of
its
history
if
the
manner
in
which
conservative
propaganda
was
conducted
at
this
moment
was
an
example
of
jewish
efficiency
it
might
be
well
to
consider
whether
on
a
future
occasion
the
task
should
not
be
confided
into
the
hands
of
simple
britons
only
effectual
way
of
combating
socialism
is
to
show
up
the
alien
influences
behind
as
long
as
the
working
man
believes
it
to
be
the
outcome
of
a
genuine
british
labour
movement
he
will
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
all
warnings
and
propaganda
will
merely
serve
to
drive
more
recruits
into
the
socialist
camp
but
let
him
once
suspect
that
he
is
being
made
the
tool
of
foreign
intrigue
and
all
his
national
feeling
will
assert
itself
we
have
only
to
ask
him
whether
he
wants
his
work
taken
from
him
by
the
import
of
alien
goods
his
housing
accommodation
appropriated
by
alien
immigrants
finally
to
make
him
understand
who
are
the
people
behind
the
scenes
advocating
a
policy
so
disastrous
to
his
true
interests
in
order
to
gain
his
support
the
secret
service
has
overwhelming
evidence
on
this
last
point
which
under
a
conservative
government
might
have
been
made
public
but
unseen
influences
in
high
places
have
ordained
its
suppression
the
slogan
britain
for
the
britons
that
would
form
the
strongest
counterblast
to
the
false
slogans
of
socialism
has
been
barred
from
conservative
platforms
and
the
very
word
alien
avoided
lest
it
should
offend
jewish
susceptibilities
thus
out
of
deference
to
the
jews
conservatism
allows
its
most
powerful
weapon
to
rust
in
its
armoury
in
reality
these
tactics
avail
nothing
to
the
conservative
cause
the
great
weight
of
jewry
will
never
be
thrown
into
the
scale
of
true
conservatism
only
in
so
far
as
conservatism
abandons
its
patriotic
traditions
and
compromises
with
the
forces
of
internationalism
will
it
win
any
considerable
jewish
support
we
have
but
to
follow
the
commitments
on
current
politics
in
the
jewish
press
in
order
to
realize
that
the
only
standard
by
which
the
jews
judge
of
any
political
party
is
the
measure
in
which
it
will
confer
exclusive
advantages
on
their
own
race
the
jewish
question
therefore
does
not
turn
on
whether
the
jews
shall
be
accorded
everywhere
equal
rights
with
the
rest
of
mankind
but
whether
they
shall
be
placed
above
the
law
whether
they
shall
be
allowed
to
occupy
everywhere
a
privileged
position
nothing
less
will
satisfy
them
and
any
attempt
to
oppose
this
claim
will
always
be
met
by
them
with
the
cry
of
persecution
further
this
position
of
privilege
represents
to
a
section
of
jewry
merely
a
stage
on
the
road
to
for
if
as
we
have
seen
by
documentary
evidence
this
plan
has
always
existed
in
the
past
is
it
likely
that
it
has
been
abandoned
at
the
very
moment
which
seems
most
propitious
for
its
realization
the
trend
of
present
events
and
the
tone
of
the
jewish
press
certainly
do
not
warrant
any
such
conclusion
to
sum
up
then
i
do
not
think
that
the
jews
can
be
proved
to
provide
the
sole
cause
of
in
order
to
establish
this
contention
we
should
be
obliged
to
show
the
jews
to
have
been
the
authors
of
every
past
social
convulsion
in
the
history
of
modern
civilization
to
discover
their
influence
behind
the
heretical
sects
of
islam
as
behind
the
bavarian
illuminati
and
the
anarchists
of
russia
in
the
absence
of
any
such
conclusive
evidence
we
must
therefore
recognize
the
existence
of
other
destructive
forces
at
work
in
the
world
but
this
is
not
to
underrate
the
importance
of
the
jewish
peril
although
the
existence
of
an
inner
circle
of
masonic
elders
remains
problematical
jewry
in
itself
constitutes
the
most
effectual
freemasonry
in
the
world
what
need
of
initiations
or
oaths
or
signs
or
passwords
amongst
people
who
perfectly
understand
each
other
and
are
everywhere
working
for
the
same
end
far
more
potent
than
the
sign
of
distress
that
summons
freemasons
to
each
other
aid
at
moments
of
peril
is
the
call
of
the
blood
that
rallies
the
most
divergent
elements
in
jewry
to
the
defence
of
the
jewish
cause
the
old
complaint
of
the
french
merchants
already
quoted
would
thus
appear
to
be
justified
that
the
jews
are
particles
of
quicksilver
which
at
the
least
slant
run
together
into
a
block
one
must
therefore
not
be
deceived
by
the
fact
that
they
often
appear
disunited
there
may
be
and
indeed
is
very
little
unity
amongst
jews
but
there
is
immense
solidarity
a
jew
named
morel
referring
to
the
persecution
of
the
converted
rabbi
drach
by
the
jews
observes
what
can
the
wisest
measures
of
the
authorities
of
all
countries
do
against
vast
and
permanent
conspiracy
of
a
which
like
a
network
as
vast
as
it
is
strong
stretched
over
the
whole
globe
brings
its
force
to
bear
wherever
an
event
occurs
that
interests
the
name
of
israelite
it
is
this
solidarity
that
constitutes
the
real
jewish
peril
and
at
the
same
time
provides
the
real
cause
of
if
in
a
world
where
all
patriotism
all
national
traditions
and
all
christian
virtues
are
being
systematically
destroyed
by
the
doctrines
of
international
socialism
one
race
alone
a
race
that
since
time
immemorial
has
cherished
the
dream
of
is
not
only
allowed
but
encouraged
to
consolidate
itself
to
maintain
all
its
national
traditions
and
to
fulfil
all
its
national
aspirations
at
the
expense
of
other
races
it
is
evident
that
christian
civilization
must
be
eventually
obliterated
the
wave
of
feeling
that
during
the
last
few
years
has
been
passing
over
this
country
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
racial
hatred
that
inspires
the
of
germany
it
is
simply
the
answer
to
a
pretension
that
britons
will
not
admit
those
of
us
who
sacrificing
popularity
and
monetary
gain
dare
to
speak
out
on
this
question
have
no
hatred
in
our
hearts
but
only
love
for
our
country
we
believe
that
not
only
our
national
security
but
our
great
national
traditions
are
at
stake
and
that
unless
england
awakens
in
time
she
will
pass
under
alien
domination
and
her
influence
as
the
stronghold
of
christian
civilization
will
be
lost
to
the
world
conclusion
we
have
now
followed
the
course
of
associations
working
throughout
nineteen
centuries
to
undermine
social
and
moral
order
and
above
all
christian
civilization
we
have
also
seen
that
although
on
the
one
hand
the
unholy
spirit
of
destruction
and
on
the
other
the
natural
spirit
of
revolt
against
oppression
have
always
existed
independently
of
any
organization
it
is
to
secret
societies
using
and
organizing
these
forces
that
the
revolutionary
movement
has
owed
its
success
further
we
have
considered
the
possibility
that
behind
both
open
and
secret
subversive
societies
there
may
exist
a
hidden
centre
of
direction
and
finally
we
have
observed
that
at
the
present
time
many
lines
of
investigation
reveal
a
connexion
between
these
groups
and
the
grand
orient
or
rather
with
an
invisible
circle
concealed
behind
that
great
masonic
power
at
the
same
time
this
circle
is
clearly
not
french
in
character
since
everywhere
the
activities
of
world
revolution
are
directed
against
france
and
england
but
seldom
against
germany
and
never
against
the
jews
it
would
not
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
no
subversive
movement
in
the
world
is
either
or
we
must
conclude
then
that
if
one
power
controls
the
rest
it
is
either
the
power
the
jewish
power
or
what
we
can
only
call
illuminism
this
last
hypothesis
is
one
that
deserves
serious
consideration
in
the
light
of
our
present
knowledge
it
does
not
appear
impossible
that
if
an
inner
circle
of
world
revolution
exists
it
consists
of
a
purely
international
group
of
men
whose
aim
is
that
of
weishaupt
the
destruction
of
the
present
system
of
society
that
such
an
aim
can
be
seriously
entertained
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
it
is
openly
proclaimed
by
a
whole
school
of
writers
and
thinkers
ranging
from
gentle
idealists
to
ferocious
anarchists
who
whilst
widely
differing
as
to
methods
and
the
ultimate
ends
to
be
attained
are
agreed
on
the
common
purpose
expressed
by
rabaud
de
in
the
words
everything
yes
everything
must
be
destroyed
since
everything
must
be
it
is
idle
to
say
that
so
insane
a
project
can
present
no
danger
to
the
world
the
fact
remains
that
an
increasing
number
of
people
regard
it
with
perfect
equanimity
the
phrase
all
civilizations
have
passed
away
ours
will
doubtless
pass
away
likewise
is
continually
to
be
heard
on
the
lips
of
apparently
sane
men
and
women
who
whether
they
advocate
such
an
eventuality
or
not
seem
prepared
to
accept
it
in
a
spirit
of
complete
fatalism
and
to
put
up
no
resistance
the
point
they
ignore
is
that
when
civilization
existed
only
in
isolated
spots
on
the
earth
surface
it
might
pass
away
in
one
spot
only
to
spring
to
life
in
another
but
now
that
civilization
is
the
dream
of
a
return
to
nature
and
the
joys
of
savagery
conjured
up
by
rousseau
and
weishaupt
can
never
be
realized
yet
if
civilization
in
a
material
sense
can
not
be
destroyed
it
is
none
the
less
possible
to
take
the
soul
out
of
it
to
reduce
it
to
a
dead
and
heartless
machine
without
human
feelings
or
divine
aspirations
the
bolsheviks
continue
to
exist
amidst
telephones
electric
light
and
other
amenities
of
modern
life
but
they
have
almost
killed
the
soul
of
russia
in
this
sense
then
civilization
may
pass
away
not
as
the
civilizations
of
the
ancient
world
passed
away
leaving
only
desert
sands
and
crumbling
ruins
behind
them
but
vanishing
imperceptibly
from
beneath
the
outward
structure
of
our
existing
institutions
here
is
the
final
goal
of
world
revolution
if
then
one
inner
circle
exists
composed
of
illuminati
animated
by
a
purely
destructive
purpose
it
is
conceivable
that
they
might
find
support
in
those
germans
who
desire
to
disintegrate
the
countries
of
the
allies
with
a
view
to
future
conquests
and
in
those
jews
who
hope
to
establish
their
empire
on
the
ruins
of
christian
civilization
hence
the
superb
organization
and
the
immense
financial
resources
at
the
disposal
of
the
world
revolutionaries
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
that
the
hidden
centre
of
direction
consists
in
a
circle
of
jews
located
in
the
background
of
the
grand
orient
or
perhaps
like
the
early
illuminati
located
nowhere
but
working
in
accord
and
using
both
and
gentile
illuminati
as
their
tools
on
this
point
i
think
it
would
be
dangerous
at
present
to
dogmatize
but
that
the
problem
is
capable
of
elucidation
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
if
the
secret
services
of
the
world
had
chosen
to
and
make
public
the
facts
in
their
possession
the
whole
plot
might
long
since
have
been
laid
bare
a
department
for
the
investigation
of
subversive
movements
should
have
had
a
place
in
every
ordered
government
this
might
have
been
created
by
the
recent
conservative
government
in
england
but
the
same
mysterious
influence
that
protected
the
enemy
during
the
great
war
has
throughout
prevented
disclosures
that
would
have
enlightened
the
country
on
the
real
nature
of
the
peril
confronting
it
in
the
present
state
of
european
politics
the
only
course
open
to
those
who
would
save
civilization
is
to
act
independently
of
governments
and
form
a
in
each
country
with
unofficial
bureaux
of
information
maintaining
relations
with
each
other
yet
each
retaining
its
national
character
as
far
as
this
country
is
concerned
i
am
convinced
that
only
a
great
national
movement
can
save
us
from
destruction
a
movement
in
which
men
of
all
classes
and
above
all
of
the

take
part
fascismo

italy
because
it
was
not
as
it
has
been
absurdly
represented
a
reactionary
movement
but
because
it
was
essentially
democratic
and
progressive
because
by
appealing
to
the
noblest
instincts
in
human
nature
to
patriotism
and
it
rallied
all
elements
in
a
disorganized
and
disunited
nation
around
the
standard
of

common
cause
one
can
not
bring
about
any
great
movement
without
first
kindling
a
sacred
fire
in
the
hearts
of

can
not
move

of
people
merely
by
appealing
to

must
have
a
cause
to
fight
for
a
cause
that
is
not
entirely

own

whilst
enlisting
a
large
proportion
of
its
following

appealing
to
their
baser
instincts
has
nevertheless
by
its
false
ideals
and
promises
been
able
to
kindle
a
fire
in
many
generous
hearts
and
to
persuade
deluded
enthusiasts
that
they
are
working
for
the
welfare
of

the
only
way
to
combat
socialism
is
to
create
counter

true
ideal

even
mussolini
found
that
a
purely
secular
ideal
was
not
enough
and
that

fervour
was
necessary
to
defeat

appendix
i
jewish
evidence
on
the
talmud
the
denunciation
of
the
talmud
by
the
jew
pfefferkorn
in
and
the
drach
in
have
been
quoted
in
the
course
of
this
book
graetz
however
in
his
of
the
quotes
an
earlier
incident
of
this
kind
in
the
thirteenth
century
a
converted
jew
and
former
talmudist
donin
who
on
his
baptism
assumed
the
name
of
nicholas
presented
himself
before
the
pope
gregory
ix
and
brought
charges
against
the
talmud
saying
that
it
distorted
the
words
of
holy
writ
and
in
the
agadic
portions
of
it
there
were
to
be
found
disgraceful
representations
of
god
that
it
contained
many
gross
errors
and
absurdities
further
that
it
was
filled
with
abuse
against
the
founder
of
the
christian
religion
and
the
virgin
donin
demonstrated
that
it
was
the
talmud
which
prevented
the
jews
from
accepting
christianity
and
that
without
it
they
would
certainly
have
abandoned
their
state
of
unbelief
again
he
stated
that
the
talmudical
writings
taught
it
was
a
meritorious
action
to
kill
the
best
man
among
the
christians
that
it
was
lawful
to
deceive
a
christian
without
any
scruple
that
it
was
permitted
to
jews
to
break
a
promise
made
on
oath
these
graetz
describes
as
lying
charges
the
jews
were
accordingly
ordered
by
the
pope
to
hand
over
all
their
copies
of
the
talmud
to
the
dominicans
and
franciscans
for
examination
and
if
their
judgment
should
corroborate
the
charges
of
nicholas
donin
they
were
to
burn
the
volumes
of
the
talmud
june
in
france
graetz
goes
on
to
relate
that
the
and
louis
ix
that
is
to
say
saint
louis
pursued
the
same
course
the
talmud
was
put
on
its
trial
four
distinguished
rabbis
of
north
france
were
commanded
by
the
king
to
hold
a
public
disputation
with
nicholas
either
to
refute
the
imputations
levelled
against
the
talmud
or
to
make
confession
of
the
abuse
against
christianity
and
the
blasphemies
against
god
that
it
contained
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
a
fairer
decision
and
the
blanche
de
castille
was
careful
to
assure
the
first
witness
summoned
that
if
the
lives
of
the
rabbis
were
in
danger
she
would
protect
them
and
that
he
was
only
required
to
answer
the
questions
that
would
be
asked
of
him
now
there
would
have
been
nothing
simpler
than
for
the
rabbis
to
admit
honestly
that
these
offensive
passages
existed
that
they
had
been
written
perhaps
in
moments
of
passion
in
a
less
enlightened
age
that
they
recognized
the
indelicacy
of
insulting
the
religion
of
the
country
in
which
they
lived
and
that
therefore
such
passages
should
henceforth
be
deleted
but
instead
of
adopting
this
straightforward
course
which
might
have
put
an
end
for
ever
to
attacks
on
the
book
they
held
sacred
the
rabbis
proceeded
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
alleged
blasphemous
and
immoral
expressions
and
to
declare
that
the
odious
facts
related
in
the
talmud
concerning
a
jesus
the
son
of
pantheras
had
no
reference
to
jesus
of
nazareth
but
to
one
of
a
similar
name
who
had
lived
long
before
him
graetz
who
admits
that
this
was
an
error
and
that
the
passages
in
question
did
relate
to
the
jesus
of
the
christians
represents
the
rabbis
as
being
merely
misled
on
the
question
but
the
king
who
was
not
misled
by
the
rabbis
ordered
all
copies
of
the
talmud
to
be
burnt
and
in
june
these
were
committed
to
the
flames
the
talmud
however
continued
to
exist
and
it
was
not
until
that
as
we
have
already
seen
the
offending
passages
against
christ
were
expunged
by
the
rabbis
as
a
measure
of
expediency
now
that
they
have
been
replaced
no
further
attempt
is
made
to
deny
that
they
refer
to
the
founder
of
christianity
as
far
as
i
am
aware
they
are
not
included
in
any
english
translation
of
the
talmud
but
may
be
found
in
an
english
version
of
gustav
dalman
book
christus
im
ii
the
protocols
of
the
elders
of
zion
contrary
to
the
assertions
of
certain
writers
i
have
never
affirmed
my
belief
in
the
authenticity
of
the
protocols
but
have
always
treated
it
as
an
entirely
open
question
the
only
opinion
to
which
i
have
committed
myself
is
that
whether
genuine
or
not
the
protocols
do
represent
the
programme
of
world
revolution
and
that
in
view
of
their
prophetic
nature
and
of
their
extraordinary
resemblance
to
the
protocols
of
certain
secret
societies
in
the
past
they
were
either
the
work
of
some
such
society
or
of
someone
profoundly
versed
in
the
lore
of
secret
societies
who
was
able
to
reproduce
their
ideas
and
phraseology
the
refutation
of
the
protocols
which
appeared
in
the
of
august
tends
to
confirm
this
opinion
according
to
these
articles
the
protocols
were
largely
copied
from
the
book
of
maurice
joly
aux
enfers
entre
machiavel
et
published
in
let
it
be
said
at
once
that
the
resemblance
between
the
two
works
could
not
be
accidental
not
only
are
whole
paragraphs
almost
identical
but
the
various
points
in
the
programme
follow
each
other
in
precisely
the
same
order
but
whether
nilus
copied
from
joly
or
the
same
source
whence
joly
derived
his
is
another
question
it
will
be
noticed
that
joly
in
his
preface
never
claimed
to
have
originated
the
scheme
described
in
his
book
on
the
contrary
he
distinctly
states
that
it
personifies
in
particular
a
political
system
which
has
not
varied
for
a
single
day
in
its
application
since
the
disastrous
and
alas
too
date
of
its
enthronement
could
this
refer
only
to
the
government
of
napoleon
iii
established
twelve
years
earlier
or
might
it
not
be
taken
to
signify
a
machiavellian
system
of
government
of
which
napoleon
iii
was
suspected
by
joly
at
this
moment
of
being
the
exponent
we
have
already
seen
that
this
system
is
said
by
de
mazères
in
his
book
machiavel
et
de
de
sa
doctrine
sur
les
opinions
les
moeurs
et
la
politique
de
la
france
pendant
la
published
in
to
have
been
inaugurated
by
the
french
revolution
and
to
have
been
carried
on
by
napoleon
i
against
whom
he
brings
precisely
the
same
accusations
of
machiavellism
that
joly
brings
against
napoleon
iii
the
author
of
he
writes
was
always
his
guide
and
he
goes
on
to
describe
the
parrot
cries
placed
in
the
mouths
of
the
people
the
hired
writers
salaried
newspapers
mercenary
poets
and
corrupt
ministers
employed
to
mislead
our
vanity
methodically
all
this
being
carried
on
by
the
scholars
of
machiavelli
under
the
orders
of
his
cleverest
disciple
we
have
already
traced
the
course
of
these
methods
from
the
illuminati
onwards
now
precisely
at
the
moment
when
joly
published
his
aux
the
secret
societies
were
particularly
active
and
since
by
this
date
a
number
of
jews
had
penetrated
into
their
ranks
a
whole
crop
of
literary
efforts
directed
against
jews
and
secret
societies
marked
the
decade
eckert
with
his
work
on
freemasonry
in
had
given
the
incentive
crétineau
joly
followed
in
with
romaine
en
face
de
la
reproducing
the
documents
of
the
haute
vente
romaine
in
came
the
book
of
the
german
goedsche
and
in
the
following
year
on
a
higher
plane
the
work
of
gougenot
des
mousseaux
juif
le
judaïsme
et
la
judaïsation
des
peuples
meanwhile
in
the
israëlite
had
arisen
having
for
its
ultimate
object
the
great
work
of
humanity
the
annihilation
of
error
and
fanaticism
the
union
of
human
society
in
a
faithful
and
solid
fraternity
a
formula
singularly
reminiscent
of
grand
orient
philosophy
in
karl
marx
obtained
control
of
the
international
working
men
association
by
which
a
number
of
secret
societies
became
absorbed
and
in
the
same
year
bakunin
founded
his
sociale
on
the
exact
lines
of
weishaupt
illuminism
and
in
wrote
his
contre
les
or
sur
les
juifs
mainly
directed
against
the
jews
of
the
the
sixties
of
the
last
century
therefore
mark
an
important
era
in
the
history
of
the
secret
societies
and
it
was
right
in
the
middle
of
this
period
that
maurice
joly
published
his
book
now
it
will
be
remembered
that
amongst
the
sets
of
parallels
to
the
protocols
quoted
by
me
in
two
were
taken
from
the
sources
above
quoted
the
documents
of
the
haute
vente
romaine
and
the
programme
of
bakunin
secret
society
the
sociale
meanwhile
lucien
wolf
had
found
another
parallel
to
the
protocols
in
goedsche
book
the
protocols
wolf
had
no
hesitation
in
asserting
are
in
short
an
amplified
imitation
of
goedsche
handiwork
and
he
went
on
to
show
that
nilus
followed
this
pamphlet
very
closely
the
protocols
were
then
declared
by
wolf
and
his
friends
to
have
been
completely
and
finally
refuted
but
alas
for
wolfe
discernment
the
articles
came
and
abolished
the
whole
of
his
carefully
constructed
theory
they
did
not
however
demolish
mine
on
the
contrary
they
supplied
another
and
a
very
curious
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
for
is
it
not
remarkable
that
one
of
the
sets
of
parallels
quoted
by
me
appeared
in
the
same
year
as
joly
book
and
that
within
the
space
of
nine
years
no
less
than
four
parallels
to
the
protocols
should
have
been
discovered
let
us
recapitulate
the
events
of
this
decade
in
the
form
of
a
table
and
the
proximity
of
dates
will
then
be
more
apparent

at

goedsche
parallels
quoted
by
lucien
wolf
gougenot
des

bakunin
contre

it
will
be
seen
then
that
at
the
moment
when
maurice
joly
wrote
his
the
ideas
they
embodied
were
current
in
many
different
circles
it
is
interesting
moreover
to
notice
that
the
authors
of
the
last
two
works
referred
to
above
the
catholic
and
royalist
des
mousseaux
and
the
anarchist
bakunin
between
whom
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
any
connexion
both
in
the
same
year
denounced
the
growing
power
of
the
jews
whom
bakunin
described
as
the
most
formidable
sect
in
europe
and
again
asserted
that
a
leakage
of
information
had
taken
place
in
the
secret
societies
thus
in
bakunin
explains
that
his
secret
society
has
been
broken
up
because
its
secrets
have
been
given
away
and
that
his
colleague
netchaïeff
has
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
in
order
to
found
a
serious
and
indestructible
society
one
must
take
for
a
basis
the
policy
of
machiavelli
meanwhile
gougenot
des
mousseaux
had
related
in
that
in
december
he
had
received
a
letter
from
a
german
statesman
saying
since
the
revolutionary
recrudescence
of
i
have
had
relations
with
a
jew
who
from
vanity
betrayed
the
secret
of
the
secret
societies
with
which
he
had
been
associated
and
who
warned
me
eight
or
ten
days
beforehand
of
all
the
revolutions
which
were
about
to
break
out
at
any
point
of
europe
i
owe
to
him
the
unshakeable
conviction
that
all
these
movements
of
oppressed
peoples
are
devised
by
half
a
dozen
individuals
who
give
their
orders
to
the
secret
societies
of
all
europe
the
ground
is
absolutely
mined
beneath
our
feet
and
the
jews
provide
a
large
contingent
of
these
miners
these
words
were
written
in
the
year
after
the
aux
were
published
it
is
further
important
to
notice
that
joly
work
is
dated
from
geneva
the
for
all
the
revolutionaries
of
europe
including
bakunin
who
was
there
in
the
same
year
and
where
the
first
congress
of
the
led
by
karl
marx
was
held
two
years
later
already
the
revolutionary
camp
was
divided
into
warring
factions
and
the
rivalry
between
marx
and
mazzini
had
been
superseded
by
the
struggle
between
marx
and
bakunin
and
all
these
men
were
members
of
secret
societies
it
is
by
no
means
improbable
then
that
joly
himself
a
revolutionary
should
during
his
stay
in
geneva
have
come
into
touch
with
the
members
of
some
secret
organization
who
may
have
betrayed
to
him
their
own
secret
or
those
of
a
rival
organization
they
had
reason
to
suspect
of
working
under
the
cover
of
revolutionary
doctrines
for
an
ulterior
end
thus
the
protocols
of
a
secret
society
modelled
on
the
lines
of
the
illuminati
or
the
haute
vente
romaine
may
have
passed
into
his
hands
and
been
utilized
by
him
as
an
attack
on
napoleon
who
owing
to
his
known
connexion
with
the
carbonari
might
have
appeared
to
joly
as
the
chief
exponent
of
the
machiavellian
art
of
duping
the
people
and
using
them
as
the
lever
to
power
which
the
secret
societies
had
reduced
to
a
system
this
would
explain
maurice
joly
mysterious
reference
to
the
political
system
which
has
not
varied
for
a
single
day
in
its
application
since
the
disastrous
and
alas
too
date
of
its
enthronement
moreover
it
would
explain
the
resemblance
between
all
the
parallels
to
the
protocols
from
the
writings
of
the
illuminati
and
mirabeau
de
of
onwards
for
if
the
system
had
never
varied
the
code
on
which
it
was
founded
must
have
remained
substantially
the
same
further
if
it
had
never
varied
up
to
the
time
when
joly
wrote
why
should
it
have
varied
since
that
date
the
rules
of
lawn
tennis
drawn
up
in
would
probably
bear
a
strong
resemblance
to
those
of
and
would
also
probably
follow
each
other
in
the
same
sequence
the
differences
would
occur
where
modern
improvements
had
been
added
might
not
the
same
process
of
evolution
have
taken
place
between
the
dates
at
which
the
works
of
joly
and
nilus
were
published
i
do
not
agree
with
the
opinion
of
the
that
the
author
of
the
protocols
must
have
had
the
of
joly
before
him
it
is
possible
but
not
proven
indeed
i
find
it
difficult
to
imagine
that
anyone
embarking
on
such
an
elaborate
imposture
should
not
have
possessed
the
wit
to
avoid
quoting
passages
verbatim
without
even
troubling
to
arrange
them
in
a
different
sequence
from
a
book
which
might
at
any
moment
be
produced
as
evidence
against
him
for
contrary
to
the
assertions
of
the
the
of
joly
is
by
no
means
a
rare
book
not
only
was
it
to
be
found
at
the
british
museum
but
at
the
london
library
and
recently
i
was
able
to
buy
a
copy
for
the
modest
sum
of
francs
there
was
therefore
every
possibility
of
nilus
being
suddenly
confronted
with
the
source
of
his
plagiarism
further
is
it
conceivable
that
a
plagiarist
so
unskilful
and
so
unimaginative
would
have
been
capable
of
improving
on
the
original
for
the
protocols
are
a
vast
improvement
on
the
of
joly
the
most
striking
passages
they
contain
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
earlier
work
nor
which
is
more
remarkable
are
several
of
the
amazing
prophecies
concerning
the
future
which
time
has
realized
it
is
this
latter
fact
which
presents
the
most
insuperable
obstacle
to
the
solution
of
the
problem
to
sum
up
then
the
protocols
are
either
a
mere
plagiarism
of
maurice
joly
work
in
which
case
the
prophetic
passages
added
by
nilus
or
another
remain
unexplained
or
they
are
a
revised
edition
of
the
plan
communicated
to
joly
in
brought
up
to
date
and
supplemented
so
as
to
suit
modern
conditions
by
the
continuers
of
the
plot
whether
in
this
case
the
authors
of
the
protocols
were
jews
or
whether
the
jewish
portions
have
been
interpolated
by
the
people
into
whose
hands
they
fell
is
another
question
here
we
must
admit
the
absence
of
any
direct
evidence
an
international
circle
of
world
revolutionaries
working
on
the
lines
of
the
illuminati
of
which
the
existence
has
already
been
indicated
offers
a
perfectly
possible
alternative
to
the
learned
elders
of
zion
it
would
be
easier
however
to
absolve
the
jews
from
all
suspicion
of
complicity
if
they
and
their
friends
had
adopted
a
more
straightforward
course
from
the
time
the
protocols
appeared
when
some
years
ago
a
work
of
the
same
kind
was
directed
against
the
jesuits
containing
what
purported
to
be
a
secret
plan
of
revolution
closely
resembling
the
protocols
the
jesuits
indulged
in
no
invectives
made
no
appeal
that
the
book
should
be
burnt
by
the
common
hangman
resorted
to
no
fantastic
explanations
but
quietly
pronounced
the
charge
to
be
a
fabrication
thus
the
matter
ended
but
from
the
moment
the
protocols
were
published
the
jews
and
their
friends
had
recourse
to
every
tortuous
method
of
defence
brought
pressure
to
bear
on
the
publishers
succeeded
in
fact
in
temporarily
stopping
the
sales
appealed
to
the
home
secretary
to
order
their
suppression
concocted
one
clinching
refutation
after
another
all
mutually
exclusive
of
each
other
so
that
by
the
time
the
solution
now
pronounced
to
be
the
correct
one
appeared
we
had
already
been
assured
half
a
dozen
times
that
the
protocols
had
been
completely
and
finally
refuted
and
when
at
last
a
really
plausible
explanation
had
been
discovered
why
was
it
not
presented
in
a
convincing
manner
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
state
that
the
origin
of
the
protocols
had
been
found
in
the
work
of
maurice
joly
giving
parallels
in
support
of
this
assertion
what
need
to
envelop
a
good
case
in
a
web
of
obvious
romance
why
all
this
parade
of
confidential
sources
of
information
the
pretence
that
joly
book
was
so
rare
as
to
be
almost
unfindable
when
a
search
in
the
libraries
would
have
proved
the
contrary
why
these
allusions
to
constantinople
as
the
place
to
find
the
key
to
dark
secrets
to
the
mysterious
who
does
not
wish
his
real
name
to
be
known
and
to
the
anonymous
of
the
okhrana
from
whom
by
mere
chance
he
bought
the
very
copy
of
the
used
for
the
fabrication
of
the
protocols
by
the
okhrana
itself
although
this
fact
was
unknown
to
the
officer
in
question
why
further
should
if
he
were
a
russian
landowner
orthodox
by
religion
and
a
constitutional
monarchist
be
so
anxious
to
discredit
his
fellow
monarchists
by
making
the
outrageous
assertion
that
the
only
occult
masonic
organization
such
as
the
protocols
speak
of
that
is
to
say
a
machiavellian
system
of
an
abominable
kind
which
he
had
been
able
to
discover
in
southern
russia
was
a
monarchist
one
it
is
evident
then
that
the
complete
story
of
the
protocols
has
not
yet
been
told
and
that
much
yet
remains
to
be
discovered

was

the

it
we
can
be
fairly
certain
that
its
roots
stretch
back
very
far
and
that
the
mediæval
and
geonic
kabbala
was
the
culmination
and
not
the
inception
of
jewish
esoteric
mysticism
from
the
time
of
graetz
it
has
been
the
fashion
to
decry
the
kabbala
and
to
regard
it
as
a
later
incrustation
as
something
of
which
judaism
had
reason
to
be
ashamed
the
writer
goes
on
to
express
the
opinion
that
the
recent
tendency
requires
adjustment
the
kabbala
though
later
in
form
than
is
claimed
by
its
adherents
is
far
older

it
is
not
generally
known
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
mohammedans
removed
their
kiblah
from
jerusalem
to
mecca
was
that
they
quarrelled
with
the
jews
over
jesus
christ
and
the
proof
of
this
may
still
be
seen
in
the
golden
gate
leading
into
the
sacred
area
of
the
temple
which
was
bricked
up
by
the
mohammedans
and
is
bricked
up
to
this
day
because
they
declared
that
nobody
should
enter
through
that
portal
until
jesus
christ
comes
to
judge
the
world
and
this
is
stated
in
the
koran
i
can
not
trace
this
passage
in

but
much
the

idea
is

believe
that

will
slay

taking
him
for

would

the

at

awaking

unbuttoned

suspended
round

took
to

disappeared

the
mystery
of
this

was
never
