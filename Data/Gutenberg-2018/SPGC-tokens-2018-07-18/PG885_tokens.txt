to
be
educated
lady
basildon
ah
i
hate
being
educated
marchmont
so
do
i
it
puts
one
almost
on
a
level
with
the
commercial
classes
doesn
t
it
but
dear
gertrude
chiltern
is
always
telling
me
that
i
should
have
some
serious
purpose
in
life
so
i
come
here
to
try
to
find
one
lady
basildon
round
through
her
i
don
t
see
anybody
here
whom
one
could
possibly
call
a
serious
purpose
the
man
who
took
me
in
to
dinner
talked
to
me
about
his
wife
the
whole
time
marchmont
how
very
trivial
of
him
lady
basildon
terribly
trivial
what
did
your
man
talk
about
marchmont
about
myself
lady
basildon
and
were
you
interested
marchmont
her
not
in
the
smallest
degree
lady
basildon
what
martyrs
we
are
dear
margaret
marchmont
and
how
well
it
becomes
us
olivia

good
evening
lady
chiltern
has
my
young
son
been
here
lady
chiltern
i
don
t
think
lord
goring
has
arrived
yet
mabel
chiltern
up
lord
caversham
why
do
you
call
lord
goring
mabel
chiltern
a
perfect
example
of
the
english
type
of
has
all
the
fragrance
and
freedom
of
a
is
ripple
after
ripple
of
sunlight
in
her
the
little
its
parted
the
mouth
of
a
has
the
fascinating
tyranny
of
the
astonishing
courage
of
sane
people
she
is
not
reminiscent
of
any
work
of
she
is
really
like
a
tanagra
would
be
rather
annoyed
if
she
were
told
lord
caversham
because
he
leads
such
an
idle
life
mabel
chiltern
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
why
he
rides
in
the
row
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
goes
to
the
opera
three
times
a
week
changes
his
clothes
at
least
five
times
a
day
and
dines
out
every
night
of
the
season
you
don
t
call
that
leading
an
idle
life
do
you
lord
caversham
at
her
with
a
kindly
twinkle
in
his
you
are
a
very
charming
young
lady
mabel
chiltern
how
sweet
of
you
to
say
that
lord
caversham
do
come
to
us
more
often
you
know
we
are
always
at
home
on
wednesdays
and
you
look
so
well
with
your
star
lord
caversham
never
go
anywhere
now
sick
of
london
society
shouldn
t
mind
being
introduced
to
my
own
tailor
he
always
votes
on
the
right
side
but
object
strongly
to
being
sent
down
to
dinner
with
my
wife
s
milliner
never
could
stand
lady
caversham
s
bonnets
mabel
chiltern
oh
i
love
london
society
i
think
it
has
immensely
improved
it
is
entirely
composed
now
of
beautiful
idiots
and
brilliant
lunatics
just
what
society
should
be
lord
caversham
hum
which
is
goring
beautiful
idiot
or
the
other
thing
mabel
chiltern
i
have
been
obliged
for
the
present
to
put
lord
goring
into
a
class
quite
by
himself
but
he
is
developing
charmingly
lord
caversham
into
what
mabel
chiltern
a
little
i
hope
to
let
you
know
very
soon
lord
caversham
mason
lady
markby
cheveley
lady
markby
cheveley
lady
markby
a
gray
hair
à
la
marquise
and
good
cheveley
accompanies
tall
and
rather
very
thin
and
line
of
scarlet
on
a
pallid
red
long
accentuates
the
natural
paleness
of
her
eyes
that
move
is
in
looks
rather
like
an
makes
great
demands
on
one
s
all
her
movements
she
is
extremely
work
of
the
showing
the
influence
of
too
many
lady
markby
good
evening
dear
gertrude
so
kind
of
you
to
let
me
bring
my
friend
cheveley
two
such
charming
women
should
know
each
other
lady
chiltern
cheveley
a
sweet
suddenly
bows
rather
i
think
cheveley
and
i
have
met
before
i
did
not
know
she
had
married
a
second
time
lady
markby
ah
nowadays
people
marry
as
often
as
they
can
don
t
they
it
is
most
fashionable
duchess
of
maryborough
dear
duchess
and
how
is
the
duke
brain
still
weak
i
suppose
well
that
is
only
to
be
expected
is
it
not
his
good
father
was
just
the
same
there
is
nothing
like
race
is
there
cheveley
with
her
but
have
we
really
met
before
lady
chiltern
i
can
t
remember
where
i
have
been
out
of
england
for
so
long
lady
chiltern
we
were
at
school
together
cheveley
cheveley
indeed
i
have
forgotten
all
about
my
schooldays
i
have
a
vague
impression
that
they
were
detestable
lady
chiltern
i
am
not
surprised
cheveley
her
sweetest
do
you
know
i
am
quite
looking
forward
to
meeting
your
clever
husband
lady
chiltern
since
he
has
been
at
the
foreign
office
he
has
been
so
much
talked
of
in
vienna
they
actually
succeed
in
spelling
his
name
right
in
the
newspapers
that
in
itself
is
fame
on
the
continent
lady
chiltern
i
hardly
think
there
will
be
much
in
common
between
you
and
my
husband
cheveley
vicomte
de
nanjac
ah
chère
madame
queue
surprise
i
have
not
seen
you
since
berlin
cheveley
not
since
berlin
vicomte
five
years
ago
vicomte
de
nanjac
and
you
are
younger
and
more
beautiful
than
ever
how
do
you
manage
it
cheveley
by
making
it
a
rule
only
to
talk
to
perfectly
charming
people
like
yourself
vicomte
de
nanjac
ah
you
flatter
me
you
butter
me
as
they
say
here
cheveley
do
they
say
that
here
how
dreadful
of
them
vicomte
de
nanjac
yes
they
have
a
wonderful
language
it
should
be
more
widely
known
sir
robert
chiltern
man
of
looking
somewhat
and
personality
of
personalities
intensely
admired
by
the
deeply
respected
by
the
note
of
his
manner
is
that
of
perfect
a
slight
touch
of
feels
that
he
is
conscious
of
the
success
he
has
made
in
nervous
a
tired
mouth
and
chin
contrast
strikingly
with
the
romantic
expression
in
the
variance
is
suggestive
of
an
almost
complete
separation
of
passion
and
though
thought
and
emotion
were
each
isolated
in
its
own
sphere
through
some
violence
of
is
nervousness
in
the
in
the
would
be
inaccurate
to
call
him
can
not
survive
the
house
of
vandyck
would
have
liked
to
have
painted
his
sir
robert
chiltern
good
evening
lady
markby
i
hope
you
have
brought
sir
john
with
you
lady
markby
oh
i
have
brought
a
much
more
charming
person
than
sir
john
sir
john
s
temper
since
he
has
taken
seriously
to
politics
has
become
quite
unbearable
really
now
that
the
house
of
commons
is
trying
to
become
useful
it
does
a
great
deal
of
harm
sir
robert
chiltern
i
hope
not
lady
markby
at
any
rate
we
do
our
best
to
waste
the
public
time
don
t
we
but
who
is
this
charming
person
you
have
been
kind
enough
to
bring
to
us
lady
markby
her
name
is
cheveley
one
of
the
dorsetshire
cheveleys
i
suppose
but
i
really
don
t
know
families
are
so
mixed
nowadays
indeed
as
a
rule
everybody
turns
out
to
be
somebody
else
sir
robert
chiltern
cheveley
i
seem
to
know
the
name
lady
markby
she
has
just
arrived
from
vienna
sir
robert
chiltern
ah
yes
i
think
i
know
whom
you
mean
lady
markby
oh
she
goes
everywhere
there
and
has
such
pleasant
scandals
about
all
her
friends
i
really
must
go
to
vienna
next
winter
i
hope
there
is
a
good
chef
at
the
embassy
sir
robert
chiltern
if
there
is
not
the
ambassador
will
certainly
have
to
be
recalled
pray
point
out
cheveley
to
me
i
should
like
to
see
her
lady
markby
let
me
introduce
you
mrs
cheveley
my
dear
sir
robert
chiltern
is
dying
to
know
you
sir
robert
chiltern
every
one
is
dying
to
know
the
brilliant
cheveley
our
attachés
at
vienna
write
to
us
about
nothing
else
cheveley
thank
you
sir
robert
an
acquaintance
that
begins
with
a
compliment
is
sure
to
develop
into
a
real
friendship
it
starts
in
the
right
manner
and
i
find
that
i
know
lady
chiltern
already
sir
robert
chiltern
really
cheveley
yes
she
has
just
reminded
me
that
we
were
at
school
together
i
remember
it
perfectly
now
she
always
got
the
good
conduct
prize
i
have
a
distinct
recollection
of
lady
chiltern
always
getting
the
good
conduct
prize
sir
robert
chiltern
and
what
prizes
did
you
get
cheveley
cheveley
my
prizes
came
a
little
later
on
in
life
i
don
t
think
any
of
them
were
for
good
conduct
i
forget
sir
robert
chiltern
i
am
sure
they
were
for
something
charming
cheveley
i
don
t
know
that
women
are
always
rewarded
for
being
charming
i
think
they
are
usually
punished
for
it
certainly
more
women
grow
old
nowadays
through
the
faithfulness
of
their
admirers
than
through
anything
else
at
least
that
is
the
only
way
i
can
account
for
the
terribly
haggard
look
of
most
of
your
pretty
women
in
london
sir
robert
chiltern
what
an
appalling
philosophy
that
sounds
to
attempt
to
classify
you
cheveley
would
be
an
impertinence
but
may
i
ask
at
heart
are
you
an
optimist
or
a
pessimist
those
seem
to
be
the
only
two
fashionable
religions
left
to
us
nowadays
cheveley
oh
i
m
neither
optimism
begins
in
a
broad
grin
and
pessimism
ends
with
blue
spectacles
besides
they
are
both
of
them
merely
poses
sir
robert
chiltern
you
prefer
to
be
natural
cheveley
sometimes
but
it
is
such
a
very
difficult
pose
to
keep
up
sir
robert
chiltern
what
would
those
modern
psychological
novelists
of
whom
we
hear
so
much
say
to
such
a
theory
as
that
cheveley
ah
the
strength
of
women
comes
from
the
fact
that
psychology
can
not
explain
us
men
can
be
analysed
women
merely
adored
sir
robert
chiltern
you
think
science
can
not
grapple
with
the
problem
of
women
cheveley
science
can
never
grapple
with
the
irrational
that
is
why
it
has
no
future
before
it
in
this
world
sir
robert
chiltern
and
women
represent
the
irrational
cheveley
women
do
sir
robert
chiltern
a
polite
i
fear
i
could
hardly
agree
with
you
there
but
do
sit
down
and
now
tell
me
what
makes
you
leave
your
brilliant
vienna
for
our
gloomy
perhaps
the
question
is
indiscreet
cheveley
questions
are
never
indiscreet
answers
sometimes
are
sir
robert
chiltern
well
at
any
rate
may
i
know
if
it
is
politics
or
pleasure
cheveley
politics
are
my
only
pleasure
you
see
nowadays
it
is
not
fashionable
to
flirt
till
one
is
forty
or
to
be
romantic
till
one
is
so
we
poor
women
who
are
under
thirty
or
say
we
are
have
nothing
open
to
us
but
politics
or
philanthropy
and
philanthropy
seems
to
me
to
have
become
simply
the
refuge
of
people
who
wish
to
annoy
their
i
prefer
politics
i
think
they
are
more
becoming
sir
robert
chiltern
a
political
life
is
a
noble
career
cheveley
sometimes
and
sometimes
it
is
a
clever
game
sir
robert
and
sometimes
it
is
a
great
nuisance
sir
robert
chiltern
which
do
you
find
it
cheveley
i
a
combination
of
all
three
her
sir
robert
chiltern
up
allow
me
cheveley
thanks
sir
robert
chiltern
but
you
have
not
told
me
yet
what
makes
you
honour
london
so
suddenly
our
season
is
almost
over
cheveley
oh
i
don
t
care
about
the
london
season
it
is
too
matrimonial
people
are
either
hunting
for
husbands
or
hiding
from
them
i
wanted
to
meet
you
it
is
quite
true
you
know
what
a
woman
s
curiosity
is
almost
as
great
as
a
man
s
i
wanted
immensely
to
meet
you
and
to
ask
you
to
do
something
for
me
sir
robert
chiltern
i
hope
it
is
not
a
little
thing
cheveley
i
find
that
little
things
are
so
very
difficult
to
do
cheveley
a
moment
s
no
i
don
t
think
it
is
quite
a
little
thing
sir
robert
chiltern
i
am
so
glad
do
tell
me
what
it
is
cheveley
later
on
and
now
may
i
walk
through
your
beautiful
house
i
hear
your
pictures
are
charming
poor
baron
remember
the
baron
to
tell
me
you
had
some
wonderful
corots
sir
robert
chiltern
an
almost
imperceptible
did
you
know
baron
arnheim
well
cheveley
intimately
did
you
sir
robert
chiltern
at
one
time
cheveley
wonderful
man
wasn
t
he
sir
robert
chiltern
a
he
was
very
remarkable
in
many
ways
cheveley
i
often
think
it
such
a
pity
he
never
wrote
his
memoirs
they
would
have
been
most
interesting
sir
robert
chiltern
yes
he
knew
men
and
cities
well
like
the
old
greek
cheveley
without
the
dreadful
disadvantage
of
having
a
penelope
waiting
at
home
for
him
mason
lord
goring
lord
goring
always
says
he
is
is
would
not
like
to
be
thought
flawless

be
annoyed
if
he
were
considered
plays
with

on
perfectly
good
terms
with
the
is
fond
of
being

bad

dreadful

once

bad
qualities

nice

a
question
miss
mabel

brought
cheveley
here
that
woman
in
heliotrope
who
has
just
gone
out
of
the
room
with
your
brother
mabel

think
lady

ask
lord
goring
i
haven
t
seen
her
for
years
that
is
all
mabel
chiltern
what
an
absurd
reason
lord
goring
all
reasons
are
absurd
mabel
chiltern
what
sort
of
a
woman
is
she
lord
goring
oh
a
genius
in
the
daytime
and
a
beauty
at
night
mabel
chiltern
i
dislike
her
already
lord
goring
that
shows
your
admirable
good
taste
vicomte
de
nanjac
ah
the
english
young
lady
is
the
dragon
of
good
taste

she

the
dragon
of
good
taste
lord
goring
so
the
newspapers
are
always
telling
us
vicomte
de
nanjac
i
read
all
your
english
newspapers
i
find
them
so
amusing
lord
goring
then
my
dear
nanjac
you
must
certainly
read
between
the
lines
vicomte
de
nanjac
i
should
like
to
but
my
professor
objects
mabel
chiltern
may
i
have
the
pleasure
of
escorting
you
to
the
mademoiselle
mabel
chiltern
very
delighted
vicomte
quite
delighted
lord
goring
aren
t
you
coming
to
the
lord
goring
not
if
there
is
any
music
going
on
miss
mabel
mabel
chiltern
the
music
is
in
german
you
would
not
understand
it
out
with
vicomte
de
nanjac
lord
caversham
up
to
his
lord
caversham
well
sir
what
are
you
doing
here
wasting
your
life
as
usual
you
should
be
in
bed
sir
you
keep
too
late
hours
i
heard
of
you
the
other
night
at
lady
rufford
s
dancing
till
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
lord
goring
only
a
quarter
to
four
father
lord
caversham
can
t
make
out
how
you
stand
london
society
the
thing
has
gone
to
the
dogs
a
lot
of
damned
nobodies
talking
about
nothing
lord
goring
i
love
talking
about
nothing
father
it
is
the
only
thing
i
know
anything
about
lord
caversham
you
seem
to
me
to
be
living
entirely
for
pleasure
lord
goring
what
else
is
there
to
live
for
father
nothing
ages
like
happiness
lord
caversham
you
are
heartless
sir
very
heartless
lord
goring
i
hope
not
father
good
evening
lady
basildon
lady
basildon
two
pretty
are
you
here
i
had
no
idea
you
ever
came
to
political
parties
lord
goring
i
adore
political
parties
they
are
the
only
place
left
to
us
where
people
don
t
talk
politics
lady
basildon
i
delight
in
talking
politics
i
talk
them
all
day
long
but
i
can
t
bear
listening
to
them
i
don
t
know
how
the
unfortunate
men
in
the
house
stand
these
long
debates
lord
goring
by
never
listening
lady
basildon
really
lord
goring
his
most
serious
of
course
you
see
it
is
a
very
dangerous
thing
to
listen
if
one
listens
one
may
be
convinced
and
a
man
who
allows
himself
to
be
convinced
by
an
argument
is
a
thoroughly
unreasonable
person
lady
basildon
ah
that
accounts
for
so
much
in
men
that
i
have
never
understood
and
so
much
in
women
that
their
husbands
never
appreciate
in
them
marchmont
a
our
husbands
never
appreciate
anything
in
us
we
have
to
go
to
others
for
that
lady
basildon
yes
always
to
others
have
we
not
lord
goring
and
those
are
the
views
of
the
two
ladies
who
are
known
to
have
the
most
admirable
husbands
in
london
marchmont
that
is
exactly
what
we
can
t
stand
my
reginald
is
quite
hopelessly
faultless
he
is
really
unendurably
so
at
times
there
is
not
the
smallest
element
of
excitement
in
knowing
him
lord
goring
how
terrible
really
the
thing
should
be
more
widely
known
lady
basildon
basildon
is
quite
as
bad
he
is
as
domestic
as
if
he
was
a
bachelor
marchmont
lady
basildon
s
my
poor
olivia
we
have
married
perfect
husbands
and
we
are
well
punished
for
it
lord
goring
i
should
have
thought
it
was
the
husbands
who
were
punished
marchmont
herself
oh
dear
no
they
are
as
happy
as
possible
and
as
for
trusting
us
it
is
tragic
how
much
they
trust
us
lady
basildon
perfectly
tragic
lord
goring
or
comic
lady
basildon
lady
basildon
certainly
not
comic
lord
goring
how
unkind
of
you
to
suggest
such
a
thing
marchmont
i
am
afraid
lord
goring
is
in
the
camp
of
the
enemy
as
usual
i
saw
him
talking
to
that
cheveley
when
he
came
in
lord
goring
handsome
woman
cheveley
lady
basildon
please
don
t
praise
other
women
in
our
presence
you
might
wait
for
us
to
do
that
lord
goring
i
did
wait
marchmont
well
we
are
not
going
to
praise
her
i
hear
she
went
to
the
opera
on
monday
night
and
told
tommy
rufford
at
supper
that
as
far
as
she
could
see
london
society
was
entirely
made
up
of
dowdies
and
dandies
lord
goring
she
is
quite
right
too
the
men
are
all
dowdies
and
the
women
are
all
dandies
aren
t
they
marchmont
a
oh
do
you
really
think
that
is
what
cheveley
meant
lord
goring
of
course
and
a
very
sensible
remark
for
cheveley
to
make
too
mabel
chiltern
joins
the
mabel
chiltern
why
are
you
talking
about
cheveley
everybody
is
talking
about
cheveley
lord
goring
did
you
say
lord
goring
about
cheveley
oh
i
remember
that
she
was
a
genius
in
the
daytime
and
a
beauty
at
night
lady
basildon
what
a
horrid
combination
so
very
unnatural
marchmont
her
most
dreamy
i
like
looking
at
geniuses
and
listening
to
beautiful
people
lord
goring
ah
that
is
morbid
of
you
marchmont
marchmont
to
a
look
of
real
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
marchmont
and
i
have
been
married
for
seven
years
and
he
has
never
once
told
me
that
i
was
morbid
men
are
so
painfully
unobservant
lady
basildon
to
i
have
always
said
dear
margaret
that
you
were
the
most
morbid
person
in
london
marchmont
ah
but
you
are
always
sympathetic
olivia
mabel
chiltern
is
it
morbid
to
have
a
desire
for
food
i
have
a
great
desire
for
food
lord
goring
will
you
give
me
some
supper

pleasure

horrid

been

never
talked
to
me
the
whole
evening

goring
how
could
i
you
went
away
with
the
mabel
chiltern
you
might
have
followed

been

polite

all
this
evening

a
more
marked
way

much

should
like
some
supper
lady
basildon

positively
dying

things

grossly
material

these
painful
scenes
of
jealousy
in
public
go
downstairs
with
the
other
sir
robert
chiltern
cheveley
now
sir
robert
chiltern
and
are
you
going
to
any
of
our
country
houses
before
you
leave
england
cheveley
cheveley
oh
no
i
can
t
stand
your
english
in
england
people
actually
try
to
be
brilliant
at
breakfast
that
is
so
dreadful
of
them
only
dull
people
are
brilliant
at
breakfast
and
then
the
family
skeleton
is
always
reading
family
prayers
my
stay
in
england
really
depends
on
you
sir
robert
down
on
the
sir
robert
chiltern
a
seat
beside
seriously
cheveley
quite
seriously
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
a
great
political
and
financial
scheme
about
this
argentine
canal
company
in
fact
sir
robert
chiltern
what
a
tedious
practical
subject
for
you
to
talk
about
cheveley
cheveley
oh
i
like
tedious
practical
subjects
what
i
don
t
like
are
tedious
practical
people
there
is
a
wide
difference
besides
you
are
interested
i
know
in
international
canal
schemes
you
were
lord
radley
s
secretary
weren
t
you
when
the
government
bought
the
suez
canal
shares
sir
robert
chiltern
yes
but
the
suez
canal
was
a
very
great
and
splendid
undertaking
it
gave
us
our
direct
route
to
india
it
had
imperial
value
it
was
necessary
that
we
should
have
control
this
argentine
scheme
is
a
commonplace
stock
exchange
swindle
cheveley
a
speculation
sir
robert
a
brilliant
daring
speculation
sir
robert
chiltern
believe
me
cheveley
it
is
a
swindle
let
us
call
things
by
their
proper
names
it
makes
matters
simpler
we
have
all
the
information
about
it
at
the
foreign
office
in
fact
i
sent
out
a
special
commission
to
inquire
into
the
matter
privately
and
they
report
that
the
works
are
hardly
begun
and
as
for
the
money
already
subscribed
no
one
seems
to
know
what
has
become
of
it
the
whole
thing
is
a
second
panama
and
with
not
a
quarter
of
the
chance
of
success
that
miserable
affair
ever
had
i
hope
you
have
not
invested
in
it
i
am
sure
you
are
far
too
clever
to
have
done
that
cheveley
i
have
invested
very
largely
in
it
sir
robert
chiltern
who
could
have
advised
you
to
do
such
a
foolish
thing
cheveley
your
old
mine
sir
robert
chiltern
who
cheveley
baron
arnheim
sir
robert
chiltern
ah
yes
i
remember
hearing
at
the
time
of
his
death
that
he
had
been
mixed
up
in
the
whole
affair
cheveley
it
was
his
last
romance
his
last
but
one
to
do
him
justice
sir
robert
chiltern
but
you
have
not
seen
my
corots
yet
they
are
in
the
corots
seem
to
go
with
music
don
t
they
may
i
show
them
to
you
cheveley
her
i
am
not
in
a
mood
for
silver
twilights
or
dawns
i
want
to
talk
business
to
him
with
her
fan
to
sit
down
again
beside
sir
robert
chiltern
i
fear
i
have
no
advice
to
give
you
cheveley
except
to
interest
yourself
in
something
less
dangerous
the
success
of
the
canal
depends
of
course
on
the
attitude
of
england
and
i
am
going
to
lay
the
report
of
the
commissioners
before
the
house
night
cheveley
that
you
must
not
do
in
your
own
interests
sir
robert
to
say
nothing
of
mine
you
must
not
do
that
sir
robert
chiltern
at
her
in
in
my
own
interests
my
dear
cheveley
what
do
you
mean
down
beside
cheveley
sir
robert
i
will
be
quite
frank
with
you
i
want
you
to
withdraw
the
report
that
you
had
intended
to
lay
before
the
house
on
the
ground
that
you
have
reasons
to
believe
that
the
commissioners
have
been
prejudiced
or
misinformed
or
something
then
i
want
you
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
effect
that
the
government
is
going
to
reconsider
the
question
and
that
you
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
canal
if
completed
will
be
of
great
international
value
you
know
the
sort
of
things
ministers
say
in
cases
of
this
kind
a
few
ordinary
platitudes
will
do
in
modern
life
nothing
produces
such
an
effect
as
a
good
platitude
it
makes
the
whole
world
kin
will
you
do
that
for
me
sir
robert
chiltern
cheveley
you
can
not
be
serious
in
making
me
such
a
proposition
cheveley
i
am
quite
serious
sir
robert
chiltern
pray
allow
me
to
believe
that
you
are
not
cheveley
with
great
deliberation
and
ah
but
i
am
and
if
you
do
what
i
ask
you
i
will
pay
you
very
handsomely
sir
robert
chiltern
pay
me
cheveley
yes
sir
robert
chiltern
i
am
afraid
i
don
t
quite
understand
what
you
mean
cheveley
back
on
the
sofa
and
looking
at
how
very
disappointing
and
i
have
come
all
the
way
from
vienna
in
order
that
you
should
thoroughly
understand
me
sir
robert
chiltern
i
fear
i
don
t
cheveley
her
most
nonchalant
my
dear
sir
robert
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
and
you
have
your
price
i
suppose
everybody
has
nowadays
the
drawback
is
that
most
people
are
so
dreadfully
expensive
i
know
i
am
i
hope
you
will
be
more
reasonable
in
your
terms
sir
robert
chiltern
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
call
your
carriage
for
you
you
have
lived
so
long
abroad
cheveley
that
you
seem
to
be
unable
to
realise
that
you
are
talking
to
an
english
gentleman
cheveley
him
by
touching
his
arm
with
her
keeping
it
there
while
she
is
i
realise
that
i
am
talking
to
a
man
who
laid
the
foundation
of
his
fortune
by
selling
to
a
stock
exchange
speculator
a
cabinet
secret
sir
robert
chiltern
his
what
do
you
mean
cheveley
and
facing
i
mean
that
i
know
the
real
origin
of
your
wealth
and
your
career
and
i
have
got
your
letter
too
sir
robert
chiltern
what
letter
cheveley
the
letter
you
wrote
to
baron
arnheim
when
you
were
lord
radley
s
secretary
telling
the
baron
to
buy
suez
canal
letter
written
three
days
before
the
government
announced
its
own
purchase
sir
robert
chiltern
it
is
not
true
cheveley
you
thought
that
letter
had
been
destroyed
how
foolish
of
you
it
is
in
my
possession
sir
robert
chiltern
the
affair
to
which
you
allude
was
no
more
than
a
speculation
the
house
of
commons
had
not
yet
passed
the
bill
it
might
have
been
rejected
cheveley
it
was
a
swindle
sir
robert
let
us
call
things
by
their
proper
names
it
makes
everything
simpler
and
now
i
am
going
to
sell
you
that
letter
and
the
price
i
ask
for
it
is
your
public
support
of
the
argentine
scheme
you
made
your
own
fortune
out
of
one
canal
you
must
help
me
and
my
friends
to
make
our
fortunes
out
of
another
sir
robert
chiltern
it
is
infamous
what
you
cheveley
oh
no
this
is
the
game
of
life
as
we
all
have
to
play
it
sir
robert
sooner
or
later
sir
robert
chiltern
i
can
not
do
what
you
ask
me
cheveley
you
mean
you
can
not
help
doing
it
you
know
you
are
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
and
it
is
not
for
you
to
make
terms
it
is
for
you
to
accept
them
supposing
you
sir
robert
chiltern
what
then
cheveley
my
dear
sir
robert
what
then
you
are
ruined
that
is
all
remember
to
what
a
point
your
puritanism
in
england
has
brought
you
in
old
days
nobody
pretended
to
be
a
bit
better
than
his
neighbours
in
fact
to
be
a
bit
better
than
one
s
neighbour
was
considered
excessively
vulgar
and
nowadays
with
our
modern
mania
for
morality
every
one
has
to
pose
as
a
paragon
of
purity
incorruptibility
and
all
the
other
seven
deadly
what
is
the
result
you
all
go
over
like
after
the
other
not
a
year
passes
in
england
without
somebody
disappearing
scandals
used
to
lend
charm
or
at
least
interest
to
a
they
crush
him
and
yours
is
a
very
nasty
scandal
you
couldn
t
survive
it
if
it
were
known
that
as
a
young
man
secretary
to
a
great
and
important
minister
you
sold
a
cabinet
secret
for
a
large
sum
of
money
and
that
that
was
the
origin
of
your
wealth
and
career
you
would
be
hounded
out
of
public
life
you
would
disappear
completely
and
after
all
sir
robert
why
should
you
sacrifice
your
entire
future
rather
than
deal
diplomatically
with
your
enemy
for
the
moment
i
am
your
enemy
i
admit
it
and
i
am
much
stronger
than
you
are
the
big
battalions
are
on
my
side
you
have
a
splendid
position
but
it
is
your
splendid
position
that
makes
you
so
vulnerable
you
can
t
defend
it
and
i
am
in
attack
of
course
i
have
not
talked
morality
to
you
you
must
admit
in
fairness
that
i
have
spared
you
that
years
ago
you
did
a
clever
unscrupulous
thing
it
turned
out
a
great
success
you
owe
to
it
your
fortune
and
position
and
now
you
have
got
to
pay
for
it
sooner
or
later
we
have
all
to
pay
for
what
we
do
you
have
to
pay
now
before
i
leave
you
you
have
got
to
promise
me
to
suppress
your
report
and
to
speak
in
the
house
in
favour
of
this
scheme
sir
robert
chiltern
what
you
ask
is
impossible
cheveley
you
must
make
it
possible
you
are
going
to
make
it
possible
sir
robert
you
know
what
your
english
newspapers
are
like
suppose
that
when
i
leave
this
house
i
drive
down
to
some
newspaper
office
and
give
them
this
scandal
and
the
proofs
of
it
think
of
their
loathsome
joy
of
the
delight
they
would
have
in
dragging
you
down
of
the
mud
and
mire
they
would
plunge
you
in
think
of
the
hypocrite
with
his
greasy
smile
penning
his
leading
article
and
arranging
the
foulness
of
the
public
placard
sir
robert
chiltern
stop
you
want
me
to
withdraw
the
report
and
to
make
a
short
speech
stating
that

believe
there
are
possibilities
in
the
scheme

on
the
those

terms

the
winning
cards

baron

other
things

chiltern

question

subject

come
to
an
amicable
agreement
i
understood
your
nature
from
the
first
i
analysed
you
though
you
did
not
adore
me
and
now
you
can
get
my
carriage
for
me
sir
robert
i
see
the
people
coming
up
from
supper
and
englishmen
always
get
romantic
after
a
meal
and
that
bores
me
dreadfully
sir
robert
chiltern
lady
chiltern
lady
markby
lord
caversham
lady
basildon
marchmont
vicomte
de
nanjac
mr
montford
lady
markby
well
dear
cheveley
i
hope
you
have
enjoyed
yourself
sir
robert
is
very
entertaining
is
he
not
cheveley
most
entertaining
i
have
enjoyed
my
talk
with
him
immensely
lady
markby
he
has
had
a
very
interesting
and
brilliant
career
and
he
has
married
a
most
admirable
wife
lady
chiltern
is
a
woman
of
the
very
highest
principles
i
am
glad
to
say
i
am
a
little
too
old
now
myself
to
trouble
about
setting
a
good
example
but
i
always
admire
people
who
do
and
lady
chiltern
has
a
very
ennobling
effect
on
life
though
her
are
rather
dull
sometimes
but
one
can
t
have
everything
can
one
and
now
i
must
go
dear
shall
i
call
for
you
cheveley
thanks
lady
markby
we
might
drive
in
the
park
at
five
everything
looks
so
fresh
in
the
park
now
cheveley
except
the
people
lady
markby
perhaps
the
people
are
a
little
jaded
i
have
often
observed
that
the
season
as
it
goes
on
produces
a
kind
of
softening
of
the
brain
however
i
think
anything
is
better
than
high
intellectual
pressure
that
is
the
most
unbecoming
thing
there
is
it
makes
the
noses
of
the
young
girls
so
particularly
large
and
there
is
nothing
so
difficult
to
marry
as
a
large
nose
men
don
t
like
them
dear
lady
chiltern
gertrude
out
lord
caversham
s
cheveley
what
a
charming
house
you
have
lady
chiltern
i
have
spent
a
delightful
evening
it
has
been
so
interesting
getting
to
know
your
husband
lady
chiltern
why
did
you
wish
to
meet
my
husband
cheveley
cheveley
oh
i
will
tell
you
i
wanted
to
interest
him
in
this
argentine
canal
scheme
of
which
i
dare
say
you
have
heard
and
i
found
him
most
susceptible
to
reason
i
mean
a
rare
thing
in
a
man
i
converted
him
in
ten
minutes
he
is
going
to
make
a
speech
in
the
house
night
in
favour
of
the
idea
we
must
go
to
the
ladies
gallery
and
hear
him
it
will
be
a
great
occasion
lady
chiltern
there
must
be
some
mistake
that
scheme
could
never
have
my
husband
s
support
cheveley
oh
i
assure
you
it
s
all
settled
i
don
t
regret
my
tedious
journey
from
vienna
now
it
has
been
a
great
success
but
of
course
for
the
next
hours
the
whole
thing
is
a
dead
secret
lady
chiltern
a
secret
between
whom
cheveley
a
flash
of
amusement
in
her
between
your
husband
and
myself
sir
robert
chiltern
your
carriage
is
here
cheveley
cheveley
thanks
good
evening
lady
chiltern
lord
goring
i
am
at
claridge
s
don
t
you
think
you
might
leave
a
card
lord
goring
if
you
wish
it
cheveley
cheveley
oh
don
t
be
so
solemn
about
it
or
i
shall
be
obliged
to
leave
a
card
on
you
in
england
i
suppose
that
would
hardly
be
considered
en
règle
abroad
we
are
more
civilised
will
you
see
me
down
sir
robert
now
that
we
have
both
the
same
interests
at
heart
we
shall
be
great
friends
i
hope
out
sir
robert
chiltern
s
lady
chiltern
to
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
looks
down
at
them
as
they
expression
is
a
little
time
she
is
joined
by
some
of
the
passes
with
them
into
another
mabel
chiltern
what
a
horrid
woman
lord
goring
you
should
go
to
bed
miss
mabel
mabel
chiltern
lord
goring
lord
goring
my
father
told
me
to
go
to
bed
an
hour
ago
i
don
t
see
why
i
shouldn
t
give
you
the
same
advice
i
always
pass
on
good
advice
it
is
the
only
thing
to
do
with
it
it
is
never
of
any
use
to
oneself
mabel
chiltern
lord
goring
you
are
always
ordering
me
out
of
the
room
i
think
it
most
courageous
of
you
especially
as
i
am
not
going
to
bed
for
hours
over
to
the
you
can
come
and
sit
down
if
you
like
and
talk
about
anything
in
the
world
except
the
royal
academy
cheveley
or
novels
in
scotch
dialect
they
are
not
improving
subjects
sight
of
something
that
is
lying
on
the
sofa
half
hidden
by
the
what
is
this
some
one
has
dropped
a
diamond
brooch
quite
beautiful
isn
t
it
it
to
i
wish
it
was
mine
but
gertrude
won
t
let
me
wear
anything
but
pearls
and
i
am
thoroughly
sick
of
pearls
they
make
one
look
so
plain
so
good
and
so
intellectual
i
wonder
whom
the
brooch
belongs
to
lord
goring
i
wonder
who
dropped
it
mabel
chiltern
it
is
a
beautiful
brooch
lord
goring
it
is
a
handsome
bracelet
mabel
chiltern
it
isn
t
a
bracelet
it
s
a
brooch
lord
goring
it
can
be
used
as
a
bracelet
it
from
out
a
green
the
ornament
carefully
in
replaces
the
whole
thing
in
his
with
the
most
perfect
sang
mabel
chiltern
what
are
you
doing
lord
goring
miss
mabel
i
am
going
to
make
a
rather
strange
request
to
you
mabel
chiltern
oh
pray
do
i
have
been
waiting
for
it
all
the
evening
lord
goring
a
little
taken
recovers
don
t
mention
to
anybody
that
i
have
taken
charge
of
this
brooch
should
any
one
write
and
claim
it
let
me
know
at
once
mabel
chiltern
that
is
a
strange
request
lord
goring
well
you
see
i
gave
this
brooch
to
somebody
once
years
ago
mabel
chiltern
you
did
lord
goring
yes
lady
chiltern
other
guests
have
mabel
chiltern
then
i
shall
certainly
bid
you
gertrude
lady
chiltern
dear
lord
goring
you
saw
whom
lady
markby
brought
here
lord
goring
yes
it
was
an
unpleasant
surprise
what
did
she
come
here
for
lady
chiltern
apparently
to
try
and
lure
robert
to
uphold
some
fraudulent
scheme
in
which
she
is
interested
the
argentine
canal
in
fact
lord
goring
she
has
mistaken
her
man
hasn
t
she
lady
chiltern
she
is
incapable
of
understanding
an
upright
nature
like
my
husband
s
lord
goring
yes
i
should
fancy
she
came
to
grief
if
she
tried
to
get
robert
into
her
toils
it
is
extraordinary
what
astounding
mistakes
clever
women
make
lady
chiltern
i
don
t
call
women
of
that
kind
clever
i
call
them
stupid
lord
goring
same
thing
often
lady
chiltern
lady
chiltern
sir
robert
chiltern
sir
robert
chiltern
my
dear
arthur
you
are
not
going
do
stop
a
little
lord
goring
afraid
i
can
t
thanks
i
have
promised
to
look
in
at
the
hartlocks
i
believe
they
have
got
a
mauve
hungarian
band
that
plays
mauve
hungarian
music
see
you
soon
sir
robert
chiltern
how
beautiful
you
look
gertrude
lady
chiltern
robert
it
is
not
true
is
it
you
are
not
going
to
lend
your
support
to
this
argentine
speculation
you
couldn
t
sir
robert
chiltern
who
told
you
i
intended
to
do
so
lady
chiltern
that
woman
who
has
just
gone
out
cheveley
as
she
calls
herself
now
she
seemed
to
taunt
me
with
it
robert
i
know
this
woman
you
don
t
we
were
at
school
together
she
was
untruthful
dishonest
an
evil
influence
on
every
one
whose
trust
or
friendship
she
could
win
i
hated
i
despised
her
she
stole
things
she
was
a
thief
she
was
sent
away
for
being
a
thief
why
do
you
let
her
influence
you
sir
robert
chiltern
gertrude
what
you
tell
me
may
be
true
but
it
happened
many
years
ago
it
is
best
forgotten
cheveley
may
have
changed
since
then
no
one
should
be
entirely
judged
by
their
past
lady
chiltern
one
s
past
is
what
one
is
it
is
the
only
way
by
which
people
should
be
judged
sir
robert
chiltern
that
is
a
hard
saying
gertrude
lady
chiltern
it
is
a
true
saying
robert
and
what
did
she
mean
by
boasting
that
she
had
got
you
to
lend
your
support
your
name
to
a
thing
i
have
heard
you
describe
as
the
most
dishonest
and
fraudulent
scheme
there
has
ever
been
in
political
life
sir
robert
chiltern
his
i
was
mistaken
in
the
view
i
took
we
all
may
make
mistakes
lady
chiltern
but
you
told
me
yesterday
that
you
had
received
the
report
from
the
commission
and
that
it
entirely
condemned
the
whole
thing
sir
robert
chiltern
up
and
i
have
reasons
now
to
believe
that
the
commission
was
prejudiced
or
at
any
rate
misinformed
besides
gertrude
public
and
private
life
are
different
things
they
have
different
laws
and
move
on
different
lines
lady
chiltern
they
should
both
represent
man
at
his
highest
i
see
no
difference
between
them
sir
robert
chiltern
in
the
present
case
on
a
matter
of
practical
politics
i
have
changed
my
mind
that
is
all
lady
chiltern
all
sir
robert
chiltern
yes
lady
chiltern
robert
oh
it
is
horrible
that
i
should
have
to
ask
you
such
a
are
you
telling
me
the
whole
truth
sir
robert
chiltern
why
do
you
ask
me
such
a
question
lady
chiltern
a
why
do
you
not
answer
it
sir
robert
chiltern
gertrude
truth
is
a
very
complex
thing
and
politics
is
a
very
complex
business
there
are
wheels
within
wheels
one
may
be
under
certain
obligations
to
people
that
one
must
pay
sooner
or
later
in
political
life
one
has
to
compromise
every
one
does
lady
chiltern
compromise
robert
why
do
you
talk
so
differently
from
the
way
i
have
always
heard
you
talk
why
are
you
changed
sir
robert
chiltern
i
am
not
changed
but
circumstances
alter
things
lady
chiltern
circumstances
should
never
alter
principles
sir
robert
chiltern
but
if
i
told
lady
chiltern
what
sir
robert
chiltern
that
it
was
necessary
vitally
necessary
lady
chiltern
it
can
never
be
necessary
to
do
what
is
not
honourable
or
if
it
be
necessary
then
what
is
it
that
i
have
loved
but
it
is
not
robert
tell
me
it
is
not
why
should
it
be
what
gain
would
you
get
money
we
have
no
need
of
that
and
money
that
comes
from
a
tainted
source
is
a
degradation
power
but
power
is
nothing
in
itself
it
is
power
to
do
good
that
is
and
that
only
what
is
it
then
robert
tell
me
why
you
are
going
to
do
this
dishonourable
thing
sir
robert
chiltern
gertrude
you
have
no
right
to
use
that
word
i
told
you
it
was
a
question
of
rational
compromise
it
is
no
more
than
that
lady
chiltern
robert
that
is
all
very
well
for
other
men
for
men
who
treat
life
simply
as
a
sordid
speculation
but
not
for
you
robert

past
life
that

not
know
lady
chiltern
i
was
sure
of

was
sure
of

dreadful
things

unlike
your
real
self

t
let

never
see
her
again
robert
she
is
not
a
woman
you
should
ever
speak
to
she
is
not
worthy
to
talk
to
a
man
like
you
no
you
must
write
to
her
at
once
now
this
moment
and
let
your
letter
show
her
that
your
decision
is
quite
irrevocable
sir
robert
chiltern
write
this
moment

sir
robert
chiltern
but
it
is
so
late
it
is
close
on
twelve
lady
chiltern
that
makes
no
matter
she
must
know
at
once
that
she
has
been
mistaken
in
that
you
are
not
a
man
to
do
anything
base
or
underhand
or
dishonourable
write
here
robert
write
that
you
decline

this
scheme
of
hers

to
be
a
dishonest
scheme
the
word
dishonest
she
knows
what
that
word
means
sir
robert
chiltern
down
and
writes
a
wife
takes
it
up
and
reads
yes

the
envelope
mason

puts
her
arms
around
robert
love
gives
one
an
instinct
to
things
i
feel
that
i
have
saved
you
from
something
that
might
have
been
a
danger
to
you
from
something
that
might
have
made
men
honour
you
less
than
they
do
i
don
t
think
you
realise
sufficiently
robert
that
you
have
brought
into
the
political
life
of
our
time
a
nobler
atmosphere
a
finer
attitude
towards
life
a
freer
air
of
purer
aims
and
higher
know
it
and
for
that
i
love
you
robert
sir
robert
chiltern
oh
love
me
always
gertrude
love
me
always
lady
chiltern
i
will
love
you
always
because
you
will
always
be
worthy
of
love
we
needs
must
love
the
highest
when
we
see
it
him
and
rises
and
goes
sir
robert
chiltern
up
and
down
for
a
sits
down
and
buries
his
face
in
his
servant
enters
and
begins
pulling
out

robert

sir
robert
chiltern
put
out
the
lights
mason
put
out

lights
servant
puts
out
the
room
becomes
almost
only
light
there
is
comes
from
the
great
chandelier
that
hangs
over
the
staircase
and
illumines
the
tapestry
of
the
triumph
of
act
drop
second
act
scene
at
sir
robert
chiltern
s
lord
goring
in
the
height
of
lounging
in
an
sir
robert
chiltern
standing
in
front
of
the
is
evidently
in
a
state
of
great
mental
excitement
and
the
scene
progresses
he
paces
nervously
up
and
down
the
lord
goring
my
dear
robert
it
s
a
very
awkward
business
very
awkward
indeed
you
should
have
told
your
wife
the
whole
thing
secrets
from
other
people
s
wives
are
a
necessary
luxury
in
modern
life
so
at
least
i
am
always
told
at
the
club
by
people
who
are
bald
enough
to
know
better
but
no
man
should
have
a
secret
from
his
own
wife
she
invariably
finds
it
out
women
have
a
wonderful
instinct
about
things
they
can
discover
everything
except
the
obvious
sir
robert
chiltern
arthur
i
couldn
t
tell
my
wife
when
could
i
have
told
her
not
last
night
it
would
have
made
a
separation
between
us
and
i
would
have
lost
the
love
of
the
one
woman
in
the
world
i
worship
of
the
only
woman
who
has
ever
stirred
love
within
me
last
night
it
would
have
been
quite
impossible
she
would
have
turned
from
me
in
horror
in
horror
and
in
contempt
lord
goring
is
lady
chiltern
as
perfect
as
all
that
sir
robert
chiltern
yes
my
wife
is
as
perfect
as
all
that
lord
goring
off
his
what
a
pity
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
fellow
i
didn
t
quite
mean
that
but
if
what
you
tell
me
is
true
i
should
like
to
have
a
serious
talk
about
life
with
lady
chiltern
sir
robert
chiltern
it
would
be
quite
useless
lord
goring
may
i
try
sir
robert
chiltern
yes
but
nothing
could
make
her
alter
her
views
lord
goring
well
at
the
worst
it
would
simply
be
a
psychological
experiment
sir
robert
chiltern
all
such
experiments
are
terribly
dangerous
lord
goring
everything
is
dangerous
my
dear
fellow
if
it
wasn
t
so
life
wouldn
t
be
worth
living
well
i
am
bound
to
say
that
i
think
you
should
have
told
her
years
ago
sir
robert
chiltern
when
when
we
were
engaged
do
you
think
she
would
have
married
me
if
she
had
known
that
the
origin
of
my
fortune
is
such
as
it
is
the
basis
of
my
career
such
as
it
is
and
that
i
had
done
a
thing
that
i
suppose
most
men
would
call
shameful
and
dishonourable
lord
goring
yes
most
men
would
call
it
ugly
names
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
sir
robert
chiltern
men
who
every
day
do
something
of
the
same
kind
themselves
men
who
each
one
of
them
have
worse
secrets
in
their
own
lives
lord
goring
that
is
the
reason
they
are
so
pleased
to
find
out
other
people
s
secrets
it
distracts
public
attention
from
their
own
sir
robert
chiltern
and
after
all
whom
did
i
wrong
by
what
i
did
no
one
lord
goring
at
him
except
yourself
robert
sir
robert
chiltern
a
of
course
i
had
private
information
about
a
certain
transaction
contemplated
by
the
government
of
the
day
and
i
acted
on
it
private
information
is
practically
the
source
of
every
large
modern
fortune
lord
goring
his
boot
with
his
and
public
scandal
invariably
the
result
sir
robert
chiltern
up
and
down
the
arthur
do
you
think
that
what
i
did
nearly
eighteen
years
ago
should
be
brought
up
against
me
now
do
you
think
it
fair
that
a
man
s
whole
career
should
be
ruined
for
a
fault
done
in
one
s
boyhood
almost
i
was
at
the
time
and
i
had
the
double
misfortune
of
being
and
poor
two
unforgiveable
things
nowadays
is
it
fair
that
the
folly
the
sin
of
one
s
youth
if
men
choose
to
call
it
a
sin
should
wreck
a
life
like
mine
should
place
me
in
the
pillory
should
shatter
all
that
i
have
worked
for
all
that
i
have
built
up
is
it
fair
arthur
lord
goring
life
is
never
fair
robert
and
perhaps
it
is
a
good
thing
for
most
of
us
that
it
is
not
sir
robert
chiltern
every
man
of
ambition
has
to
fight
his
century
with
its
own
weapons
what
this
century
worships
is
wealth
the
god
of
this
century
is
wealth
to
succeed
one
must
have
wealth
at
all
costs
one
must
have
wealth
lord
goring
you
underrate
yourself
robert
believe
me
without
wealth
you
could
have
succeeded
just
as
well
sir
robert
chiltern
when
i
was
old
perhaps
when
i
had
lost
my
passion
for
power
or
could
not
use
it
when
i
was
tired
worn
out
disappointed
i
wanted
my
success
when
i
was
young
youth
is
the
time
for
success
i
couldn
t
wait
lord
goring
well
you
certainly
have
had
your
success
while
you
are
still
young
no
one
in
our
day
has
had
such
a
brilliant
success
for
foreign
affairs
at
the
age
of
s
good
enough
for
any
one
i
should
think
sir
robert
chiltern
and
if
it
is
all
taken
away
from
me
now
if
i
lose
everything
over
a
horrible
scandal
if
i
am
hounded
from
public
life
lord
goring
robert
how
could
you
have
sold
yourself
for
money
sir
robert
chiltern
i
did
not
sell
myself
for
money
i
bought
success
at
a
great
price
that
is
all
lord
goring
yes
you
certainly
paid
a
great
price
for
it
but
what
first
made
you
think
of
doing
such
a
thing
sir
robert
chiltern
baron
arnheim
lord
goring
damned
scoundrel
sir
robert
chiltern
no
he
was
a
man
of
a
most
subtle
and
refined
intellect
a
man
of
culture
charm
and
distinction
one
of
the
most
intellectual
men
i
ever
met
lord
goring
ah
i
prefer
a
gentlemanly
fool
any
day
there
is
more
to
be
said
for
stupidity
than
people
imagine
personally
i
have
a
great
admiration
for
stupidity
it
is
a
sort
of
i
suppose
but
how
did
he
do
it
tell
me
the
whole
thing
sir
robert
chiltern
himself
into
an
armchair
by
the
one
night
after
dinner
at
lord
radley
s
the
baron
began
talking
about
success
in
modern
life
as
something
that
one
could
reduce
to
an
absolutely
definite
science
with
that
wonderfully
fascinating
quiet
voice
of
his
he
expounded
to
us
the
most
terrible
of
all
philosophies
the
philosophy
of
power
preached
to
us
the
most
marvellous
of
all
gospels
the
gospel
of
gold
i
think
he
saw
the
effect
he
had
produced
on
me
for
some
days
afterwards
he
wrote
and
asked
me
to
come
and
see
him
he
was
living
then
in
park
lane
in
the
house
lord
woolcomb
has
now
i
remember
so
well
how
with
a
strange
smile
on
his
pale
curved
lips
he
led
me
through
his
wonderful
picture
gallery
showed
me
his
tapestries
his
enamels
his
jewels
his
carved
ivories
made
me
wonder
at
the
strange
loveliness
of
the
luxury
in
which
he
lived
and
then
told
me
that
luxury
was
nothing
but
a
background
a
painted
scene
in
a
play
and
that
power
power
over
other
men
power
over
the
world
was
the
one
thing
worth
having
the
one
supreme
pleasure
worth
knowing
the
one
joy
one
never
tired
of
and
that
in
our
century
only
the
rich
possessed
it
lord
goring
great
a
thoroughly
shallow
creed
sir
robert
chiltern
i
didn
t
think
so
then
i
don
t
think
so
now
wealth
has
given
me
enormous
power
it
gave
me
at
the
very
outset
of
my
life
freedom
and
freedom
is
everything
you
have
never
been
poor
and
never
known
what
ambition
is
you
can
not
understand
what
a
wonderful
chance
the
baron
gave
me
such
a
chance
as
few
men
get
lord
goring
fortunately
for
them
if
one
is
to
judge
by
results
but
tell
me
definitely
how
did
the
baron
finally
persuade
you
to
do
what
you
did
sir
robert
chiltern
when
i
was
going
away
he
said
to
me
that
if
i
ever
could
give
him
any
private
information
of
real
value
he
would
make
me
a
very
rich
man
i
was
dazed
at
the
prospect
he
held
out
to
me
and
my
ambition
and
my
desire
for
power
were
at
that
time
boundless
six
weeks
later
certain
private
documents
passed
through
my
hands
lord
goring
his
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
the
state
documents
sir
robert
chiltern
yes
lord
goring
passes
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
looks
lord
goring
i
had
no
idea
that
you
of
all
men
in
the
world
could
have
been
so
weak
robert
as
to
yield
to
such
a
temptation
as
baron
arnheim
held
out
to
you
sir
robert
chiltern
weak
oh
i
am
sick
of
hearing
that
phrase
sick
of
using
it
about
others
weak
do
you
really
think
arthur
that
it
is
weakness
that
yields
to
temptation
i
tell
you
that
there
are
terrible
temptations
that
it
requires
strength
strength
and
courage
to
yield
to
to
stake
all
one
s
life
on
a
single
moment
to
risk
everything
on
one
throw
whether
the
stake
be
power
or
pleasure
i
care
is
no
weakness
in
that
there
is
a
horrible
a
terrible
courage
i
had
that
courage
i
sat
down
the
same
afternoon
and
wrote
baron
arnheim
the
letter
this
woman
now
holds
he
made
of
a
million
over
the
transaction
lord
goring
and
you
sir
robert
chiltern
i
received
from
the
baron
lord
goring
you
were
worth
more
robert
sir
robert
chiltern
no
that
money
gave
me
exactly
what
i
wanted
power
over
others
i
went
into
the
house
immediately
the
baron
advised
me
in
finance
from
time
to
time
before
five
years
i
had
almost
trebled
my
fortune
since
then
everything
that
i
have
touched
has
turned
out
a
success
in
all
things
connected
with
money
i
have
had
a
luck
so
extraordinary
that
sometimes
it
has
made
me
almost
afraid
i
remember
having
read
somewhere
in
some
strange
book
that
when
the
gods
wish
to
punish
us
they
answer
our
prayers
lord
goring
but
tell
me
robert
did
you
never
suffer
any
regret
for
what
you
had
done
sir
robert
chiltern
no
i
felt
that
i
had
fought
the
century
with
its
own
weapons
and
won
lord
goring
you
thought
you
had
won
sir
robert
chiltern
i
thought
so
a
long
arthur
do
you
despise
me
for
what
i
have
told
you
lord
goring
deep
feeling
in
his
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
robert
very
sorry
indeed
sir
robert
chiltern
i
don
t
say
that
i
suffered
any
remorse
i
didn
t
not
remorse
in
the
ordinary
rather
silly
sense
of
the
word
but
i
have
paid
conscience
money
many
times
i
had
a
wild
hope
that
i
might
disarm
destiny
the
sum
baron
arnheim
gave
me
i
have
distributed
twice
over
in
public
charities
since
then
lord
goring
in
public
charities
dear
me
what
a
lot
of
harm
you
must
have
done
robert
sir
robert
chiltern
oh
don
t
say
that
arthur
don
t
talk
like
that
lord
goring
never
mind
what
i
say
robert
i
am
always
saying
what
i
shouldn
t
say
in
fact
i
usually
say
what
i
really
think
a
great
mistake
nowadays
it
makes
one
so
liable
to
be
misunderstood
as
regards
this
dreadful
business
i
will
help
you
in
whatever
way
i
can
of
course
you
know
that
sir
robert
chiltern
thank
you
arthur
thank
you
but
what
is
to
be
done
what
can
be
done
lord
goring
back
with
his
hands
in
his
well
the
english
can
t
stand
a
man
who
is
always
saying
he
is
in
the
right
but
they
are
very
fond
of
a
man
who
admits
that
he
has
been
in
the
wrong
it
is
one
of
the
best
things
in
them
however
in
your
case
robert
a
confession
would
not
do
the
money
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
is
awkward
besides
if
you
did
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
affair
you
would
never
be
able
to
talk
morality
again
and
in
england
a
man
who
can
t
talk
morality
twice
a
week
to
a
large
popular
immoral
audience
is
quite
over
as
a
serious
politician
there
would
be
nothing
left
for
him
as
a
profession
except
botany
or
the
church
a
confession
would
be
of
no
use
it
would
ruin
you
sir
robert
chiltern
it
would
ruin
me
arthur
the
only
thing
for
me
to
do
now
is
to
fight
the
thing
out
lord
goring
from
his
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
say
that
robert
it
is
the
only
thing
to
do
now
and
you
must
begin
by
telling
your
wife
the
whole
story
sir
robert
chiltern
that
i
will
not
do
lord
goring
robert
believe
me
you
are
wrong
sir
robert
chiltern
i
couldn
t
do
it
it
would
kill
her
love
for
me
and
now
about
this
woman
this
cheveley
how
can
i
defend
myself
against
her
you
knew
her
before
arthur
apparently
lord
goring
yes
sir
robert
chiltern
did
you
know
her
well
lord
goring
his
so
little
that
i
got
engaged
to
be
married
to
her
once
when
i
was
staying
at
the
tenbys
the
affair
lasted
for
three
days
nearly
sir
robert
chiltern
why
was
it
broken
off
lord
goring
oh
i
forget
at
least
it
makes
no
matter
by
the
way
have
you
tried
her
with
money
she
used
to
be
confoundedly
fond
of
money
sir
robert
chiltern
i
offered
her
any
sum
she
wanted
she
refused
lord
goring
then
the
marvellous
gospel
of
gold
breaks
down
sometimes
the
rich
can
t
do
everything
after
all
sir
robert
chiltern
not
everything
i
suppose
you
are
right
arthur
i
feel
that
public
disgrace
is
in
store
for
me
i
feel
certain
of
it
i
never
knew
what
terror
was
before
i
know
it
now
it
is
as
if
a
hand
of
ice
were
laid
upon
one
s
heart
it
is
as
if
one
s
heart
were
beating
itself
to
death
in
some
empty
hollow
lord
goring
the
robert
you
must
fight
her
you
must
fight
her
sir
robert
chiltern
but
how
lord
goring
i
can
t
tell
you
how
at
present
i
have
not
the
smallest
idea
but
every
one
has
some
weak
point
there
is
some
flaw
in
each
one
of
us
to
the
fireplace
and
looks
at
himself
in
the
my
father
tells
me
that
even
i
have
faults
perhaps
i
have
i
don
t
know
sir
robert
chiltern
in
defending
myself
against
cheveley
i
have
a
right
to
use
any
weapon
i
can
find
have
i
not
lord
goring
looking
in
the
in
your
place
i
don
t
think
i
should
have
the
smallest
scruple
in
doing
so
she
is
thoroughly
well
able
to
take
care
of
herself
sir
robert
chiltern
down
at
the
table
and
takes
a
pen
in
his
well
i
shall
send
a
cipher
telegram
to
the
embassy
at
vienna
to
inquire
if
there
is
anything
known
against
her
there
may
be
some
secret
scandal
she
might
be
afraid
of
lord
goring
his
oh
i
should
fancy
cheveley
is
one
of
those
very
modern
women
of
our
time
who
find
a
new
scandal
as
becoming
as
a
new
bonnet
and
air
them
both
in
the
park
every
afternoon
at
i
am
sure
she
adores
scandals
and
that
the
sorrow
of
her
life
at
present
is
that
she
can
t
manage
to
have
enough
of
them
sir
robert
chiltern
why
do
you
say
that
lord
goring
well
she
wore
far
too
much
rouge
last
night
and
not
quite
enough
clothes
that
is
always
a
sign
of
despair
in
a
woman
sir
robert
chiltern
a
but
it
is
worth
while
my
wiring
to
vienna
is
it
not
lord
goring
it
is
always
worth
while
asking
a
question
though
it
is
not
always
worth
while
answering
one
mason
sir
robert
chiltern
is
trafford
in
his
room
mason
yes
sir
robert
sir
robert
chiltern
what
he
has
written
into
an
he
then
carefully
tell
him
to
have
this
sent
off
in
cipher
at
once
there
must
not
be
a
moment
s
delay
mason
yes
sir
robert
sir
robert
chiltern
oh
just
give
that
back
to
me
again
something
on
the
mason
goes
out
with
the
sir
robert
chiltern
she
must
have
had
some
curious
hold
over
baron
arnheim
i
wonder
what
it
was
lord
goring
i
wonder
sir
robert
chiltern
i
will
fight
her
to
the
death
as
long
as
my
wife
knows
nothing
lord
goring
oh
fight
in
any
any
case
sir
robert
chiltern
a
gesture
of
if
my
wife
found
out
there
would
be
little
left
to
fight
for
well
as
soon
as
i
hear
from
vienna
i
shall
let
you
know
the
result
it
is
a
chance
just
a
chance
but
i
believe
in
it
and
as
i
fought
the
age
with
its
own
weapons
i
will
fight
her
with
her
weapons
it
is
only
fair
and
she
looks
like
a
woman
with
a
past
doesn
t
she
lord
goring
most
pretty
women
do
but
there
is
a
fashion
in
pasts
just
as
there
is
a
fashion
in
frocks
perhaps
cheveley
s
past
is
merely
a
slightly
décolleté
one
and
they
are
excessively
popular
nowadays
besides
my
dear
robert
i
should
not
build
too
high
hopes
on
frightening
cheveley
i
should
not
fancy
cheveley
is
a
woman
who
would
be
easily
frightened
she
has
survived
all
her
creditors
and
she
shows
wonderful
presence
of
mind
sir
robert
chiltern
oh
i
live
on
hopes
now
i
clutch
at
every
chance
i
feel
like
a
man
on
a
ship
that
is
sinking
the
water
is
round
my
feet
and
the
very
air
is
bitter
with
storm
hush
i
hear
my
wife
s
voice
lady
chiltern
walking
lady
chiltern
good
afternoon
lord
goring
lord
goring
good
afternoon
lady
chiltern
have
you
been
in
the
park
lady
chiltern

i
have
just
come
from
the
woman
s
liberal
association
where
by
the
way
robert
your
name
was
received
with
loud
applause
and
now
i
have
come
in
to
have
my
tea
lord
goring

will
wait
and
have
some
tea
won
t
you

goring
i
ll
wait
for
a
short
time
thanks
lady
chiltern
i
will
be
back
in
a
moment
i
am
only
going
to
take
my
hat
off
lord
goring
his
most
earnest
oh
please
don
t
it
is
so
pretty
one
of
the
prettiest
hats
i
ever
saw
i
hope
the
woman
s
liberal
association
received
it
with
loud
applause
lady
chiltern
a
we
have
much
more
important
work
to
do
than
look
at
each
other
s
bonnets
lord
goring
lord
goring
really
what
sort
of
work
lady
chiltern
oh
dull
useful
delightful
things
factory
acts
female
inspectors
the
eight
hours
bill
the
parliamentary
franchise
everything
in
fact
that
you
would
find
thoroughly
uninteresting
lord
goring
and
never
bonnets
lady
chiltern
mock
never
bonnets
never
lady
chiltern
out
through
the
door
leading
to
her
sir
robert
chiltern
lord
goring
s
you
have
been
a
good
friend
to
me
arthur
a
thoroughly
good
friend
lord
goring
i
don
t
know
that
i
have
been
able
to
do
much
for
you
robert
as
yet
in
fact
i
have
not
been
able
to
do
anything
for
you
as
far
as
i
can
see
i
am
thoroughly
disappointed
with
myself
sir
robert
chiltern
you
have
enabled
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
that
is
something
the
truth
has
always
stifled
me
lord
goring
ah
the
truth
is
a
thing
i
get
rid
of
as
soon
as
possible
bad
habit
by
the
way
makes
one
very
unpopular
at
the
club
with
the
older
members
they
call
it
being
conceited
perhaps
it
is
sir
robert
chiltern
i
would
to
god
that
i
had
been
able
to
tell
the
truth
to
live
the
truth
ah
that
is
the
great
thing
in
life
to
live
the
truth
goes
towards
the
i
ll
see
you
soon
again
arthur
shan
t
i
lord
goring
certainly
whenever
you
like
i
m
going
to
look
in
at
the
bachelors
ball
unless
i
find
something
better
to
do
but
i
ll
come
round
morning
if
you
should
want
me
by
any
chance
send
round
a
note
to
curzon
street
sir
robert
chiltern
thank
you
he
reaches
the
lady
chiltern
from
her
lady
chiltern
you
are
not
going
robert
sir
robert
chiltern
i
have
some
letters
to
write
dear
lady
chiltern
to
you
work
too
hard
robert
you
seem
never
to
think
of
yourself
and
you
are
looking
so
tired
sir
robert
chiltern
it
is
nothing
dear
nothing
kisses
her
and
goes
lady
chiltern
lord
goring
do
sit
down
i
am
so
glad
you
have
called
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
well
not
about
bonnets
or
the
woman
s
liberal
association
you
take
far
too
much
interest
in
the
first
subject
and
not
nearly
enough
in
the
second
lord
goring
you
want
to
talk
to
me
about
cheveley
lady
chiltern
yes
you
have
guessed
it
after
you
left
last
night
i
found
out
that
what
she
had
said
was
really
true
of
course
i
made
robert
write
her
a
letter
at
once
withdrawing
his
promise
lord
goring
so
he
gave
me
to
understand
lady
chiltern
to
have
kept
it
would
have
been
the
first
stain
on
a
career
that
has
been
stainless
always
robert
must
be
above
reproach
he
is
not
like
other
men
he
can
not
afford
to
do
what
other
men
do
looks
lord
goring
remains
don
t
you
agree
with
me
you
are
robert
s
greatest
friend
you
are
our
greatest
friend
lord
goring
no
one
except
myself
knows
robert
better
than
you
do
he
has
no
secrets
from
me
and
i
don
t
think
he
has
any
from
you
lord
goring
he
certainly
has
no
secrets
from
me
at
least
i
don
t
think
so
lady
chiltern
then
am
i
not
right
in
my
estimate
of
him
i
know
i
am
right
but
speak
to
me
frankly
lord
goring
straight
at
quite
frankly
lady
chiltern
surely
you
have
nothing
to
conceal
have
you
lord
goring
nothing
but
my
dear
lady
chiltern
i
think
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
that
in
practical
lady
chiltern
of
which
you
know
so
little
lord
lord
goring
of
which
i
know
nothing
by
experience
though
i
know
something
by
observation
i
think
that
in
practical
life
there
is
something
about
success
actual
success
that
is
a
little
unscrupulous
something
about
ambition
that
is
unscrupulous
always
once
a
man
has
set
his
heart
and
soul
on
getting
to
a
certain
point
if
he
has
to
climb
the
crag
he
climbs
the
crag
if
he
has
to
walk
in
the
lady
chiltern
well
lord
goring
he
walks
in
the
mire
of
course
i
am
only
talking
generally
about
life
lady
chiltern
i
hope
so
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
strangely
lord
goring
lord
goring
lady
chiltern
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
perhaps
you
are
a
little
hard
in
some
of
your
views
on
life
i
think
that
often
you
don
t
make
sufficient
allowances
in
every
nature
there
are
elements
of
weakness
or
worse
than
weakness
supposing
for
instance
any
public
man
my
father
or
lord
merton
or
robert
say
had
years
ago
written
some
foolish
letter
to
some
one
lady
chiltern
what
do
you
mean
by
a
foolish
letter
lord
goring
a
letter
gravely
compromising
one
s
position
i
am
only
putting
an
imaginary
case
lady
chiltern
robert
is
as
incapable
of
doing
a
foolish
thing
as
he
is
of
doing
a
wrong
thing
lord
goring
a
long
nobody
is
incapable
of
doing
a
foolish
thing
nobody
is
incapable
of
doing
a
wrong
thing
lady
chiltern
are
you
a
pessimist
what
will
the
other
dandies
say
they
will
all
have
to
go
into
mourning
lord
goring
no
lady
chiltern
i
am
not
a
pessimist
indeed
i
am
not
sure
that
i
quite
know
what
pessimism
really
means
all
i
do
know
is
that
life
can
not
be
understood
without
much
charity
can
not
be
lived
without
much
charity
it
is
love
and
not
german
philosophy
that
is
the
true
explanation
of
this
world
whatever
may
be
the
explanation
of
the
next
and
if
you
are
ever
in
trouble
lady
chiltern
trust
me
absolutely
and
i
will
help
you
in
every
way
i
can
if
you
ever
want
me
come
to
me
for
my
assistance
and
you
shall
have
it
come
at
once
to
me
lady
chiltern
at
him
in
lord
goring
you
are
talking
quite
seriously
i
don
t
think
i
ever
heard
you
talk
seriously
before
lord
goring
you
must
excuse
me
lady
chiltern
it
won
t
occur
again
if
i
can
help
it
lady
chiltern
but
i
like
you
to
be
serious
mabel
chiltern
the
most
ravishing
mabel
chiltern
dear
gertrude
don
t
say
such
a
dreadful
thing
to
lord
goring
seriousness
would
be
very
unbecoming
to
him
good
afternoon
lord
goring
pray
be
as
trivial
as
you
can
lord
goring
i
should
like
to
miss
mabel
but
i
am
afraid
i
am
a
little
out
of
practice
this
morning
and
besides
i
have
to
be
going
now
mabel
chiltern
just
when
i
have
come
in
what
dreadful
manners
you
have
i
am
sure
you
were
very
badly
brought
up
lord
goring
i
was
mabel
chiltern
i
wish
i
had
brought
you
up
lord
goring
i
am
so
sorry
you
didn
t
mabel
chiltern
it
is
too
late
now
i
suppose
lord
goring
i
am
not
so
sure
mabel
chiltern
will
you
ride
morning
lord
goring
yes
at
ten
mabel
chiltern
don
t
forget
lord
goring
of
course
i
shan
t
by
the
way
lady
chiltern
there
is
no
list
of
your
guests
in
morning
of
it
has
apparently
been
crowded
out
by
the
county
council
or
the
lambeth
conference
or
something
equally
boring
could
you
let
me
have
a
list
i
have
a
particular
reason
for
asking
you
lady
chiltern
i
am
sure
trafford
will
be
able
to
give
you
one
lord
goring
thanks
so
much
mabel
chiltern
tommy
is
the
most
useful
person
in
london
lord
goring
to
and
who
is
the
most
ornamental
mabel
chiltern
i
am
lord
goring
how
clever
of
you
to
guess
it
up
his
hat
and
lady
chiltern
you
will
remember
what
i
said
to
you
won
t
you
lady
chiltern
yes
but
i
don
t
know
why
you
said
it
to
me
lord
goring
i
hardly
know
myself
miss
mabel
mabel
chiltern
a
little
moue
of
i
wish
you
were
not
going
i
have
had
four
wonderful
adventures
this
morning
four
and
a
half
in
fact
you
might
stop
and
listen
to
some
of
them
lord
goring
how
very
selfish
of
you
to
have
four
and
a
half
there
won
t
be
any
left
for
me
mabel
chiltern
i
don
t
want
you
to
have
any
they
would
not
be
good
for
you
lord
goring
that
is
the
first
unkind
thing
you
have
ever
said
to
me
how
charmingly
you
said
it
ten
mabel
chiltern
sharp
lord
goring
quite
sharp
but
don
t
bring
trafford
mabel
chiltern
a
little
toss
of
the
of
course
i
shan
t
bring
tommy
trafford
tommy
trafford
is
in
great
disgrace
lord
goring
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
and
goes
mabel
chiltern
gertrude
i
wish
you
would
speak
to
tommy
trafford
lady
chiltern
what
has
poor
trafford
done
this
time
robert
says
he
is
the
best
secretary
he
has
ever
had
mabel
chiltern
well
tommy
has
proposed
to
me
again
tommy
really
does
nothing
but
propose
to
me
he
proposed
to
me
last
night
in
the
when
i
was
quite
unprotected
as
there
was
an
elaborate
trio
going
on
i
didn
t
dare
to
make
the
smallest
repartee
i
need
hardly
tell
you
if
i
had
it
would
have
stopped
the
music
at
once
musical
people
are
so
absurdly
unreasonable
they
always
want
one
to
be
perfectly
dumb
at
the
very
moment
when
one
is
longing
to
be
absolutely
deaf
then
he
proposed
to
me
in
broad
daylight
this
morning
in
front
of
that
dreadful
statue
of
achilles
really
the
things
that
go
on
in
front
of
that
work
of
art
are
quite
appalling
the
police
should
interfere
at
luncheon
i
saw
by
the
glare
in
his
eye
that
he
was
going
to
propose
again
and
i
just
managed
to
check
him
in
time
by
assuring
him
that
i
was
a
bimetallist
fortunately
i
don
t
know
what
bimetallism
means
and
i
don
t
believe
anybody
else
does
either
but
the
observation
crushed
tommy
for
ten
minutes
he
looked
quite
shocked
and
then
tommy
is
so
annoying
in
the
way
he
proposes
if
he
proposed
at
the
top
of
his
voice
i
should
not
mind
so
much
that
might
produce
some
effect
on
the
public
but
he
does
it
in
a
horrid
confidential
way
when
tommy
wants
to
be
romantic
he
talks
to
one
just
like
a
doctor
i
am
very
fond
of
tommy
but
his
methods
of
proposing
are
quite
out
of
date
i
wish
gertrude
you
would
speak
to
him
and
tell
him
that
once
a
week
is
quite
often
enough
to
propose
to
any
one
and
that
it
should
always
be
done
in
a
manner
that
attracts
some
attention
lady
chiltern
dear
mabel
don
t
talk
like
that
besides
robert
thinks
very
highly
of
trafford
he
believes
he
has
a
brilliant
future
before
him
mabel
chiltern
oh
i
wouldn
t
marry
a
man
with
a
future
before
him
for
anything
under
the
sun
lady
chiltern
mabel
mabel
chiltern
i
know
dear
you
married
a
man
with
a
future
didn
t
you
but
then
robert
was
a
genius
and
you
have
a
noble
character
you
can
stand
geniuses
i
have
no
character
at
all
and
robert
is
the
only
genius
i
could
ever
bear
as
a
rule
i
think
they
are
quite
impossible
geniuses
talk
so
much
don
t
they
such
a
bad
habit
and
they
are
always
thinking
about
themselves
when
i
want
them
to
be
thinking
about
me
i
must
go
round
now
and
rehearse
at
lady
basildon
s
you
remember
we
are
having
tableaux
don
t
you
the
triumph
of
something
i
don
t
know
what
i
hope
it
will
be
triumph
of
me
only
triumph
i
am
really
interested
in
at
present
lady
chiltern
goes
comes
running

gertrude

you
know
who
is
coming
to
see
you
that
dreadful
cheveley
in
a
most
lovely
gown
did
you
ask
her
lady
chiltern
cheveley
coming
to
see
me
impossible
mabel
chiltern
i
assure
you
she
is
coming
upstairs
as
large
as
life
and
not
nearly
so
natural
lady
chiltern
you
need
not
wait
mabel
remember
lady
basildon
is
expecting
you
mabel
chiltern
oh
i
must
shake
hands
with
lady
markby

delightful

love
being
scolded
by
her
mason
mason
lady

lady
markby
mrs
cheveley
lady
chiltern
to
meet
dear
lady

nice

somewhat
distantly
mrs
cheveley
won
t
you
sit
down
cheveley
cheveley
thanks
isn
t
that
miss
chiltern

should
like
so
much
to
know
her
lady
chiltern
mabel
cheveley
wishes
to
know
you
mabel
chiltern
a
little
cheveley
i
thought
your
frock
so
charming
last
night
miss
chiltern
so
simple
and
suitable
mabel
chiltern
really
i
must
tell
my
dressmaker
it
will
be
such
a
surprise
to
her
lady
markby
lady
markby
going
already
mabel
chiltern
i
am
so
sorry
but
i
am
obliged
to
i
am
just
off
to
rehearsal
i
have
got
to
stand
on
my
head
in
some
tableaux
lady
markby
on
your
head
child
oh
i
hope
not
i
believe
it
is
most
unhealthy
a
seat
on
the
sofa
lady
chiltern
mabel
chiltern
but
it
is
for
an
excellent
charity
in
aid
of
the
undeserving
the
only
people
i
am
really
interested
in
i
am
the
secretary
and
tommy
trafford
is
treasurer
cheveley
and
what
is
lord
goring
mabel
chiltern
oh
lord
goring
is
president
cheveley
the
post
should
suit
him
admirably
unless
he
has
deteriorated
since
i
knew
him
first
lady
markby
you
are
remarkably
modern
mabel
a
little
too
modern
perhaps
nothing
is
so
dangerous
as
being
too
modern
one
is
apt
to
grow
quite
suddenly
i
have
known
many
instances
of
it
mabel
chiltern
what
a
dreadful
prospect
lady
markby
ah
my
dear
you
need
not
be
nervous
you
will
always
be
as
pretty
as
possible
that
is
the
best
fashion
there
is
and
the
only
fashion
that
england
succeeds
in
setting
mabel
chiltern
a
thank
you
so
much
lady
markby
for
england
and
myself
lady
markby
lady
chiltern
dear
gertrude
we
just
called
to
know
if
cheveley
s
diamond
brooch
has
been
found
lady
chiltern
here
cheveley
yes
i
missed
it
when
i
got
back
to
claridge
s
and
i
thought
i
might
possibly
have
dropped
it
here
lady
chiltern
i
have
heard
nothing
about
it
but
i
will
send
for
the
butler
and
ask
the
cheveley
oh
pray
don
t
trouble
lady
chiltern
i
dare
say
i
lost
it
at
the
opera
before
we
came
on
here
lady
markby
ah
yes
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
at
the
opera
the
fact
is
we
all
scramble
and
jostle
so
much
nowadays
that
i
wonder
we
have
anything
at
all
left
on
us
at
the
end
of
an
evening
i
know
myself
that
when
i
am
coming
back
from
the
drawing
room
i
always
feel
as
if
i
hadn
t
a
shred
on
me
except
a
small
shred
of
decent
reputation
just
enough
to
prevent
the
lower
classes
making
painful
observations
through
the
windows
of
the
carriage
the
fact
is
that
our
society
is
terribly
really
some
one
should
arrange
a
proper
scheme
of
assisted
emigration
it
would
do
a
great
deal
of
good
cheveley
i
quite
agree
with
you
lady
markby
it
is
nearly
six
years
since
i
have
been
in
london
for
the
season
and
i
must
say
society
has
become
dreadfully
mixed
one
sees
the
oddest
people
everywhere
lady
markby
that
is
quite
true
dear
but
one
needn
t
know
them
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
half
the
people
who
come
to
my
house
indeed
from
all
i
hear
i
shouldn
t
like
to
mason
lady
chiltern
what
sort
of
a
brooch
was
it
that
you
lost
cheveley
cheveley
a
diamond
with
a
ruby
a
rather
large
ruby
lady
markby
i
thought
you
said
there
was
a
sapphire
on
the
head
dear
cheveley
no
lady
ruby
lady
markby
her
and
very
becoming
i
am
quite
sure
lady
chiltern
has
a
ruby
and
diamond
brooch
been
found
in
any
of
the
rooms
this
morning
mason
mason
no
my
lady
cheveley
it
really
is
of
no
consequence
lady
chiltern
i
am
so
sorry
to
have
put
you
to
any
inconvenience
lady
chiltern
oh
it
has
been
no
inconvenience
that
will
do
mason
you
can
bring
tea
mason
lady
markby
well
i
must
say
it
is
most
annoying
to
lose
anything
i
remember
once
at
bath
years
ago
losing
in
the
pump
room
an
exceedingly
handsome
cameo
bracelet
that
sir
john
had
given
me
i
don
t
think
he
has
ever
given
me
anything
since
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
has
sadly
degenerated
really
this
horrid
house
of
commons
quite
ruins
our
husbands
for
us
i
think
the
lower
house
by
far
the
greatest
blow
to
a
happy
married
life
that
there
has
been
since
that
terrible
thing
called
the
higher
education
of
women
was
invented
lady
chiltern
ah
it
is
heresy
to
say
that
in
this
house
lady
markby
robert
is
a
great
champion
of
the
higher
education
of
women
and
so
i
am
afraid
am
cheveley
the
higher
education
of
men
is
what
i
should
like
to
see
men
need
it
so
sadly
lady
markby
they
do
dear
but
i
am
afraid
such
a
scheme
would
be
quite
unpractical
i
don
t
think
man
has
much
capacity
for
development
he
has
got
as
far
as
he
can
and
that
is
not
far
is
it
with
regard
to
women
well
dear
gertrude
you
belong
to
the
younger
generation
and
i
am
sure
it
is
all
right
if
you
approve
of
it
in
my
time
of
course
we
were
taught
not
to
understand
anything
that
was
the
old
system
and
wonderfully
interesting
it
was
i
assure
you
that
the
amount
of
things
i
and
my
poor
dear
sister
were
taught
not
to
understand
was
quite
extraordinary
but
modern
women
understand
everything
i
am
told
cheveley
except
their
husbands
that
is
the
one
thing
the
modern
woman
never
understands
lady
markby
and
a
very
good
thing
too
dear
i
dare
say
it
might
break
up
many
a
happy
home
if
they
did
not
yours
i
need
hardly
say
gertrude
you
have
married
a
pattern
husband
i
wish
i
could
say
as
much
for
myself
but
since
sir
john
has
taken
to
attending
the
debates
regularly
which
he
never
used
to
do
in
the
good
old
days
his
language
has
become
quite
impossible
he
always
seems
to
think
that
he
is
addressing
the
house
and
consequently
whenever
he
discusses
the
state
of
the
agricultural
labourer
or
the
welsh
church
or
something
quite
improper
of
that
kind
i
am
obliged
to
send
all
the
servants
out
of
the
room
it
is
not
pleasant
to
see
one
s
own
butler
who
has
been
with
one
for
years
actually
blushing
at
the
and
the
footmen
making
contortions
in
corners
like
persons
in
circuses
i
assure
you
my
life
will
be
quite
ruined
unless
they
send
john
at
once
to
the
upper
house
he
won
t
take
any
interest
in
politics
then
will
he
the
house
of
lords
is
so
sensible
an
assembly
of
gentlemen
but
in
his
present
state
sir
john
is
really
a
great
trial
why
this
morning
before
breakfast
was
half
over
he
stood
up
on
the
hearthrug
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
appealed
to
the
country
at
the
top
of
his
voice
i
left
the
table
as
soon
as
i
had
my
second
cup
of
tea
i
need
hardly
say
but
his
violent
language
could
be
heard
all
over
the
house
i
trust
gertrude
that
sir
robert
is
not
like
that
lady
chiltern
but
i
am
very
much
interested
in
politics
lady
markby
i
love
to
hear
robert
talk
about
them
lady
markby
well
i
hope
he
is
not
as
devoted
to
blue
books
as
sir
john
is
i
don
t
think
they
can
be
quite
improving
reading
for
any
one
cheveley
i
have
never
read
a
blue
book
i
prefer
books
in
yellow
covers
lady
markby
yellow
is
a
gayer
colour
is
it
not
i
used
to
wear
yellow
a
good
deal
in
my
early
days
and
would
do
so
now
if
sir
john
was
not
so
painfully
personal
in
his
observations
and
a
man
on
the
question
of
dress
is
always
ridiculous
is
he
not
cheveley
oh
no
i
think
men
are
the
only
authorities
on
dress
lady
markby
really
one
wouldn
t
say
so
from
the
sort
of
hats
they
wear
would
one
butler
by
the
is
set
on
a
small
table
close
lady
chiltern
lady
chiltern
may
i
give
you
some
tea
cheveley
cheveley
thanks
butler
cheveley
cup
of
tea
on
a
lady
chiltern
some
tea
lady
markby
lady
markby
no
thanks
dear
servants
go
the
fact
is
i
have
promised
to
go
round
for
ten
minutes
to
see
poor
lady
brancaster
who
is
in
very
great
trouble
her
daughter
quite
a
girl
too
has
actually
become
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
curate
in
shropshire
it
is
very
sad
very
sad
indeed
i
can
t
understand
this
modern
mania
for
curates
in
my
time
we
girls
saw
them
of
course
running
about
the
place
like
rabbits
but
we
never
took
any
notice
of
them
i
need
hardly
say
but
i
am
told
that
nowadays
country
society
is
quite
honeycombed
with
them
i
think
it
most
irreligious
and
then
the
eldest
son
has
quarrelled
with
his
father
and
it
is
said
that
when
they
meet
at
the
club
lord
brancaster
always
hides
himself
behind
the
money
article
in
however
i
believe
that
is
quite
a
common
occurrence
nowadays
and
that
they
have
to
take
in
extra
copies
of
at
all
the
clubs
in
james
s
street
there
are
so
many
sons
who
won
t
have
anything
to
do
with
their
fathers
and
so
many
fathers
who
won
t
speak
to
their
sons
i
think
myself
it
is
very
much
to
be
regretted
cheveley
so
do
fathers
have
so
much
to
learn
from
their
sons
nowadays
lady
markby
really
dear
what
cheveley
the
art
of
living
the
only
really
fine
art
we
have
produced
in
modern
times
lady
markby
her
ah
i
am
afraid
lord
brancaster
knew
a
good
deal
about
that
more
than
his
poor
wife
ever
did
lady
chiltern
you
know
lady
brancaster
don
t
you
dear
lady
chiltern
just
slightly
she
was
staying
at
langton
last
autumn
when
we
were
there
lady
markby
well
like
all
stout
women
she
looks
the
very
picture
of
happiness
as
no
doubt
you
noticed
but
there
are
many
tragedies
in
her
family
besides
this
affair
of
the
curate
her
own
sister
jekyll
had
a
most
unhappy
life
through
no
fault
of
her
own
i
am
sorry
to
say
she
ultimately
was
so
that
she
went
into
a
convent
or
on
to
the
operatic
stage
i
forget
which
no
i
think
it
was
decorative
she
took
up
i
know
she
had
lost
all
sense
of
pleasure
in
life
and
now
gertrude
if
you
will
allow
me
i
shall
leave
cheveley
in
your
charge
and
call
back
for
her
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
perhaps
dear
cheveley
you
wouldn
t
mind
waiting
in
the
carriage
while
i
am
with
lady
brancaster
as
i
intend
it
to
be
a
visit
of
condolence
i
shan
t
stay
long
cheveley
i
don
t
mind
waiting
in
the
carriage
at
all
provided
there
is
somebody
to
look
at
one
lady
markby
well
i
hear
the
curate
is
always
prowling
about
the
house
cheveley
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
fond
of
girl
friends
lady
chiltern
oh
i
hope
cheveley
will
stay
here
a
little
i
should
like
to
have
a
few
minutes
conversation
with
her
cheveley
how
very
kind
of
you
lady
chiltern
believe
me
nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
lady
markby
ah
no
doubt
you
both
have
many
pleasant
reminiscences
of
your
schooldays
to
talk
over
together
dear
gertrude
shall
i
see
you
at
lady
bonar
s
she
has
discovered
a
wonderful
new
genius
he
does
nothing
at
all
i
believe
that
is
a
great
comfort
is
it
not
lady
chiltern
robert
and
i
are
dining
at
home
by
ourselves
and
i
don
t
think
i
shall
go
anywhere
afterwards
robert
of
course
will
have
to
be
in
the
house
but
there
is
nothing
interesting
on
lady
markby
dining
at
home
by
yourselves
is
that
quite
prudent
ah
i
forgot
your
husband
is
an
exception
mine
is
the
general
rule
and
nothing
ages
a
woman
so
rapidly
as
having
married
the
general
rule
lady
markby
cheveley
wonderful
woman
lady
markby
isn
t
she
talks
more
and
says
less
than
anybody
i
ever
met
she
is
made
to
be
a
public
speaker
much
more
so
than
her
husband
though
he
is
a
typical
englishman
always
dull
and
usually
violent
lady
chiltern
no
remains
is
a
the
eyes
of
the
two
women
lady
chiltern
stern
and
cheveley
rather
cheveley
i
think
it
is
right
to
tell
you
quite
frankly
that
had
i
known
who
you
really
were
i
should
not
have
invited
you
to
my
house
last
night
cheveley
an
impertinent
really
lady
chiltern
i
could
not
have
done
so
cheveley
i
see
that
after
all
these
years
you
have
not
changed
a
bit
gertrude
lady
chiltern
i
never
change
cheveley
her
then
life
has
taught
you
nothing
lady
chiltern
it
has
taught
me
that
a
person
who
has
once
been
guilty
of
a
dishonest
and
dishonourable
action
may
be
guilty
of
it
a
second
time
and
should
be
shunned
cheveley
would
you
apply
that
rule
to
every
one
lady
chiltern
yes
to
every
one
without
exception
cheveley

i
am
sorry
for
you
gertrude
very
sorry
for

london
is
quite
impossible
cheveley
back
in
her
do
you
know
gertrude

t
mind
your

whom
we
personally
dislike

dislike
me

am
quite
aware
of
that
and
i

always
detested
you

yet
i
have
come
here

do
you
a
service

that
insolent
letter

you
who
made

what
this
woman

is
quite
true
but
gertrude
listen
to
me
you
don
t
realise
how
i
was
tempted
let
me
tell
you
the
whole
thing
towards
lady
chiltern
don
t
come
near
me
don
t
touch
me
i
feel
as
if
you
had
soiled
me
for
ever
oh
what
a
mask
you
have
been
wearing
all
these
years
a
horrible
painted
mask
you
sold
yourself
for
money
oh
a
common
thief
were
better
you
put
yourself
up
to
sale
to
the
highest
bidder
you
were
bought
in
the
market
you
lied
to
the
whole
world
and
yet
you
will
not

to
me
sir
robert
chiltern
towards
gertrude
gertrude
lady
chiltern
him
back
with
outstretched
no
don
t
speak
say
nothing
your
voice
wakes
terrible
of
things
that
made
me
love
of
words
that
made
me
love
that
now
are
horrible
to
me
and
how
i
worshipped
you
you
were
to
me
something
apart
from
common
life
a
thing
pure
noble
honest
without
stain
the
world
seemed
to
me
finer
because
you
were
in
it
and
goodness
more
real
because
you
lived
and
when
i
think
that
i
made
of
a
man
like
you
my
ideal
the
ideal
of
my
life
sir
robert
chiltern
there
was
your
mistake
there
was
your
error
the
error
all
women
commit
why
can
t
you
women
love
us
faults
and
all
why
do
you
place
us
on
monstrous
pedestals
we
have
all
feet
of
clay
women
as
well
as
men
but
when
we
men
love
women
we
love
them
knowing
their
weaknesses
their
follies
their
imperfections
love
them
all
the
more
it
may
be
for
that
reason
it
is
not
the
perfect
but
the
imperfect
who
have
need
of
love
it
is
when
we
are
wounded
by
our
own
hands
or
by
the
hands
of
others
that
love
should
come
to
cure
what
use
is
love
at
all
all
sins
except
a
sin
against
itself
love
should
forgive
all
lives
save
loveless
lives
true
love
should
pardon
a
man
s
love
is
like
that
it
is
wider
larger
more
human
than
a
woman
s
women
think
that
they
are
making
ideals
of
men
what
they
are
making
of
us
are
false
idols
merely
you
made
your
false
idol
of
me
and
i
had
not
the
courage
to
come
down
show
you
my
wounds
tell
you
my
weaknesses
i
was
afraid
that
i
might
lose
your
love
as
i
have
lost
it
now
and
so
last
night
you
ruined
my
life
for
ruined
it
what
this
woman
asked
of
me
was
nothing
compared
to
what
she
offered
to
me
she
offered
security
peace
stability
the
sin
of
my
youth
that
i
had
thought
was
buried
rose
up
in
front
of
me
hideous
horrible
with
its
hands
at
my
throat
i
could
have
killed
it
for
ever
sent
it
back
into
its
tomb
destroyed
its
record
burned
the
one
witness
against
me
you
prevented
me
no
one
but
you
you
know
it
and
now
what
is
there
before
me
but
public
disgrace
ruin
terrible
shame
the
mockery
of
the
world
a
lonely
dishonoured
life
a
lonely
dishonoured
death
it
may
be
some
day
let
women
make
no
more
ideals
of
men
let
them
not
put
them
on
alters
and
bow
before
them
or
they
may
ruin
other
lives
as
completely
as
whom
i
have
so
wildly
ruined

what
other

trivial

phipps
i
will
speak
to
the
florist
my
lord
she
has
had
a
loss
in
her
family

which
perhaps
accounts
for
the
lack
of
triviality
your
lordship
complains
of

the
buttonhole
lord
goring
extraordinary
thing
about
the
lower
classes
in

always
losing
their
relations

are
extremely
fortunate
in
that
respect
lord

and
looks
at
phipps
hum
any
letters
phipps
phipps
three
my
lord
letters
on
a
lord
goring

my
cab
round
in
twenty
minutes
phipps
yes
my
lord
towards
lord
goring
up
letter
in
pink
ahem
phipps
when
did
this
letter
arrive
phipps
it
was
brought
by
hand
just
after
your
lordship
went
to
the
club
lord
goring
that
will
do
phipps
lady
chiltern
s
handwriting
on
lady
chiltern
s
pink
notepaper
that
is
rather
curious
i
thought
robert
was
to
write
wonder
what
lady
chiltern
has
got
to
say
to
me
at
bureau
and
opens
reads
i
want
you
i
trust
you
i
am
coming
to
you
down
the
letter
with
a
puzzled
takes
it
reads
it
again
i
want
you
i
trust
you
i
am
coming
to
so
she
has
found
out
everything
poor
woman
poor
woman
out
watch
and
looks
at
but
what
an
hour
to
call
ten
o
clock
i
shall
have
to
give
up
going
to
the
berkshires
however
it
is
always
nice
to
be
expected
and
not
to
arrive
i
am
not
expected
at
the
bachelors
so
i
shall
certainly
go
there
well
i
will
make
her
stand
by
her
husband
that
is
the
only
thing
for
her
to
do
that
is
the
only
thing
for
any
woman
to
do
it
is
the
growth
of
the
moral
sense
in
women
that
makes
marriage
such
a
hopeless
institution
ten
o
clock
she
should
be
here
soon
i
must
tell
phipps
i
am
not
in
to
any
one
else
towards
phipps
phipps
lord
caversham
lord
goring
oh
why
will
parents
always
appear
at
the
wrong
time
some
extraordinary
mistake
in
nature

suppose
lord
caversham
delighted
to
see
you
my
dear
father
to
meet
lord
caversham
take
my
cloak
off
lord
goring
is
it
worth
while

course
it
is
worth
while
sir
which
is
the
most
comfortable
chair
lord
goring
this
one
father
it
is
the
chair
i
use
myself
when
i
have
visitors
lord
caversham

i
hope
in
this
room
lord
goring

to
hear
it
can
t
stand
draughts

draughts
at

hour

caversham

admirable
hour

fact
is
father

is
not
my
day
for

seriously

am
very
sorry

not
my
day
lord
caversham
what
do
you
mean
sir
lord
goring
during
the
season
father
i
only
talk
seriously
on
the
first
tuesday
in
every
month
from
four
to
seven
lord
caversham
well
make
it
tuesday
sir

it
tuesday
lord
goring
but
it
is
after

father
and
my
doctor
says

it
makes
me
talk
in
my
sleep

caversham

that
matter

to
you

an
inconsolable
widower
for
three
months
and
was
already
paying
my
addresses
to
your
admirable
mother
damme
sir
it
is
your
duty
to
get
married
you
can
t
be
always
living
for
pleasure
every
man
of
position
is
married
nowadays
bachelors
are
not
fashionable
any
more
they
are
a
damaged
lot
too
much
is
known
about
them
you
must
get
a
wife
sir
look
where
your
friend
robert
chiltern
has
got
to
by
probity
hard
work
and
a
sensible
marriage
with
a
good
woman
why
don
t
you
imitate
him
sir
why
don
t
you
take
him
for
your
model
lord
goring
i
think
i
shall
father
lord
caversham
i
wish
you
would
sir
then
i
should
be
happy
at
present
i
make
your
mother
s
life
miserable
on
your
account
you
are
heartless
sir
quite
heartless
lord
goring
i
hope
not
father
lord
caversham
and
it
is
high
time
for
you
to
get
married
you
are
years
of
age
sir
lord
goring
yes
father
but
i
only
admit
to
and
a
half
when
i
have
a
really
good
buttonhole
this
buttonhole
is
not
trivial
enough
lord
caversham
i
tell
you
you
are
sir
and
there
is
a
draught
in
your
room
besides
which
makes
your
conduct
worse
why
did
you
tell
me
there
was
no
draught
sir
i
feel
a
draught
sir
i
feel
it
distinctly
lord
goring
so

i
father
it
is
a
dreadful
draught
i
will
come
and
see
you
father
we
can
talk
over
anything
you
like
let
me
help
you
on
with
your
cloak
father
lord
caversham
no
sir
i
have
called
this
evening
for
a
definite
purpose
and
i
am
going
to
see
it
through
at
all
costs
to
my
health
or
yours
put
down
my
cloak
sir
lord
goring
certainly
father
but

us
go
into
another
room

a
dreadful
draught

there
a
good
fire
in
the
phipps
yes
my
lord
lord
goring
come
in
there
father
your
sneezes
are
quite
heartrending
lord
caversham
well
sir
i
suppose
i
have
a
right
to
sneeze
when
i
choose
lord
goring
quite
so
father
i
was
merely
expressing
sympathy
lord
caversham
oh
damn
sympathy
there
is
a
great
deal
too
much
of
that
sort
of
thing
going
on
nowadays
lord
goring
i
quite
agree
with
you
father
if
there
was
less
sympathy
in
the
world
there
would
be
less
trouble
in
the
world
lord
caversham
towards
the
that
is
a
paradox
sir
i
hate
paradoxes
lord
goring
so
do
i
father
everybody
one
meets
is
a
paradox
nowadays
it
is
a
great
bore
it
makes
society
so
obvious
lord
caversham
looking
at
his
son
beneath
his
bushy
do
you
always
really
understand
what
you
say
sir
lord
goring
some
yes
father

caversham
if

attentively
conceited
young
puppy

the
phipps

a
lady

her
into
the
when
she
arrives
you

phipps

my
lord
lord
goring
it
is
a
matter
of
the
gravest
importance
phipps
phipps
i
understand
my
lord
lord
goring
no
one
else
is
to
be
admitted
under
any
circumstances
phipps
i
understand
my
lord
lord
goring
ah
that
is
probably
the
lady
i
shall
see
her
myself
as
he
is
going
towards
the
lord
caversham
from
the
lord
caversham
well

i
to
wait

moment

my
instructions

room
phipps
yes
my
lord
lord
goring
into
the
harold
footman
cheveley
is
in
green
and
has
a
cloak
of
black
with
dead
harold
what
name
madam
cheveley
phipps
advances
towards
is
lord
goring
not
here
i
was
told
he
was
at
home
phipps
his
lordship
is
engaged
at
present
with
lord
caversham
madam
a
eye
harold
at
once
cheveley
how
very
filial
phipps
his
lordship
told
me
to
ask
you
madam
to
be
kind
enough
to
wait
in
the
for
him
his
lordship
will
come
to
you
there
cheveley
a
look
of
lord
goring
expects
me
phipps
yes
madam
cheveley
are
you
quite
sure
phipps
his
lordship
told
me
that
if
a
lady
called
i
was
to
ask
her
to
wait
in
the
to
the
door
of
the
and
opens
his
lordship
s
directions
on
the
subject
were
very
precise
cheveley
how
thoughtful
of
him
to
expect
the
unexpected
shows
a
thoroughly
modern
intellect
towards
the
and
looks
ugh
how
dreary
a
bachelor
s
always
looks
i
shall
have
to
alter
all
this
phipps
the
lamp
from
the
no
i
don
t
care
for
that
lamp
it
is
far
too
glaring
light
some
candles
phipps
certainly
madam
cheveley
i
hope
the
candles
have
very
becoming
shades
phipps
we
have
had
no
complaints
about
them
madam
as
yet
into
the
and
begins
to
light
the
cheveley
i
wonder
what
woman
he
is
waiting
for
it
will
be
delightful
to
catch
him
men
always
look
so
silly
when
they
are
caught
and
they
are
always
being
caught
about
room
and
approaches
the
what
a
very
interesting
room
what
a
very
interesting
picture
wonder
what
his
correspondence
is
like
up
oh
what
a
very
uninteresting
correspondence
bills
and
cards
debts
and
dowagers
who
on
earth
writes
to
him
on
pink
paper
how
silly
to
write
on
pink
paper
it
looks
like
the
beginning
of
a
romance
romance
should
never
begin
with
sentiment
it
should
begin
with
science
and
end
with
a
settlement
letter
takes
it
up
i
know
that
handwriting
that
is
gertrude
chiltern
s
i
remember
it
perfectly
the
ten
commandments
in
every
stroke
of
the
pen
and
the
moral
law
all
over
the
page
wonder
what
gertrude
is
writing
to
him
about
something
horrid
about
me
i
suppose
how
i
detest
that
woman
i
trust
you
i
want
you
i
am
coming
to
you
i
trust
you
i
want
you
i
am
coming
to
look
of
triumph
comes
over
her
is
just
about
to
steal
the
phipps
phipps
the
candles
in
the
are
lit
madam
as
you
directed
cheveley
thank
you
hastily
and
slips
the
letter
under
a
large
that
is
lying
on
the
phipps
i
trust
the
shades
will
be
to
your
liking
madam
they
are
the
most
becoming
we
have
they
are
the
same
as
his
lordship
uses
himself
when
he
is
dressing
for
dinner
cheveley
a
then
i
am
sure
they
will
be
perfectly
right
phipps
thank
you
madam
cheveley
into
the
phipps
the
door
and
door
is
then
slowly
cheveley
out
and
creeps
stealthily
towards
the
voices
are
heard
from
the
cheveley
voices
grow
she
goes
back
into
the
her
lord
goring
lord
caversham
lord
goring
my
dear
father
if
i
am
to
get
married
surely
you
will
allow
me
to
choose
the
time
place
and
person
particularly
the
person
lord
caversham
that
is
a
matter
for
me
sir
you
would
probably
make
a
very
poor
choice
it
is
i
who
should
be
consulted
not
you
there
is
property
at
stake
it
is
not
a
matter
for
affection
affection
comes
later
on
in
married
life
lord
goring
yes
in
married
life
affection
comes
when
people
thoroughly
dislike
each
other
father
doesn
t
it
lord
caversham
s
for
lord
caversham
certainly
sir
i
mean
certainly
not
air
you
are
talking
very
foolishly
what
i
say
is
that
marriage
is
a
matter
for
common
sense
lord
goring
but
women
who
have
common
sense
are
so
curiously
plain
father
aren
t
they
of
course
i
only
speak
from
hearsay
lord
caversham
no
woman
plain
or
pretty
has
any
common
sense
at
all
sir
common
sense
is
the
privilege
of
our
sex
lord
goring
quite
so
and
we
men
are
so
that
we
never
use
it
do
we
father
lord
caversham
i
use
it
sir
i
use
nothing
else
lord
goring
so
my
mother
tells
me
lord
caversham
it
is
the
secret
of
your
mother
s
happiness
you
are
very
heartless
sir
very
heartless
lord
goring
i
hope
not
father
out
for
a
rather
put
sir
robert
chiltern
sir
robert
chiltern
my
dear
arthur
what
a
piece
of
good
luck
meeting
you
on
the
doorstep
your
servant
had
just
told
me
you
were
not
at
home
how
extraordinary
lord
goring
the
fact
is
i
am
horribly
busy
robert
and
i
gave
orders
i
was
not
at
home
to
any
one
even
my
father
had
a
comparatively
cold
reception
he
complained
of
a
draught
the
whole
time
sir
robert
chiltern
ah
you
must
be
at
home
to
me
arthur
you
are
my
best
friend
perhaps
by
you
will
be
my
only
friend
my
wife
has
discovered
everything
lord
goring
ah
i
guessed
as
much
sir
robert
chiltern
at
really
how
lord
goring
some
oh
merely
by
something
in
the
expression
of
your
face
as
you
came
in
who
told
her
sir
robert
chiltern
cheveley
herself
and
the
woman
i
love
knows
that
i
began
my
career
with
an
act
of
low
dishonesty
that
i
built
up
my
life
upon
sands
of
i
sold
like
a
common
huckster
the
secret
that
had
been
intrusted
to
me
as
a
man
of
honour
i
thank
heaven
poor
lord
radley
died
without
knowing
that
i
betrayed
him
i
would
to
god
i
had
died
before
i
had
been
so
horribly
tempted
or
had
fallen
so
low
his
face

his
lord

heard
nothing
from

eight
o
clock

goring
well

robert
chiltern
nothing
is
absolutely
known
against
her
on
the
contrary
she
occupies
a
rather
high
position
in
society
it
is
a
sort
of
open
secret
that
baron
arnheim
left
her
the
greater
portion
of
his
immense
fortune
beyond
that
i
can
learn
nothing
lord
goring
she
doesn
t
turn
out
to
be
a
spy
then
sir
robert
chiltern
oh
spies
are
of
no
use
nowadays
their
profession
is
over
the
newspapers
do
their
work
instead
lord
goring
and
thunderingly
well
they
do
it
sir
robert
chiltern
arthur
i
am
parched
with
thirst

t

t

what
to

friend

will
you
excuse
me
for
a
moment
robert
i
want
to
give
some
directions
to
my
servant
sir
robert
chiltern
certainly
lord
goring
when
that
lady
calls
tell
her
that
i
am
not
expected
home
this
evening
tell
her
that
i
have
been
suddenly
called
out
of
town
you
understand
phipps
the
lady
is
in
that
room
my
lord
you
told
me
to
show
her
into
that
room
my
lord
lord
goring
you
did
perfectly
right
phipps
what
a
mess
i
am
in
no
i
think
i
shall
get
through
it
i
ll
give
her
a
lecture
through
the
door
awkward
thing
to
manage
though
sir
robert
chiltern
arthur
tell
me
what
i
should
do
my
life
seems
to
have
crumbled
about
me
i
am
a
ship
without
a
rudder
in
a
night
without
a
star
lord
goring
robert
you
love
your
wife
don
t
you
sir
robert
chiltern
i
love
her
more
than
anything
in
the
world
i
used
to
think
ambition
the
great
thing
it
is
not
love
is
the
great
thing
in
the
world
there
is
nothing
but
love
and
i
love
her
but
i
am
defamed
in
her
eyes
i
am
ignoble
in
her
eyes
there
is
a
wide
gulf
between
us
now
she
has
found
me
out
arthur
she
has
found
me
out
lord
goring
has
she
never
in
her
life
done
some
she
should
not
forgive
your
sin
sir
robert
chiltern
my
wife
never
she
does
not
know
what
weakness
or
temptation
is
i
am
of
clay
like
other
men
she
stands
apart
as
good
women
in
her
and
stern
and
without
mercy
but
i
love
her
arthur
we
are
childless
and
i
have
no
one
else
to
love
no
one
else
to
love
me
perhaps
if
god
had
sent
us
children
she
might
have
been
kinder
to
me
but
god
has
given
us
a
lonely
house
and
she
has
cut
my
heart
in
two
don
t
let
us
talk
of
it
i
was
brutal
to
her
this
evening
but
i
suppose
when
sinners
talk
to
saints
they
are
brutal
always
i
said
to
her
things
that
were
hideously
true
on
my
side
from
my
from
the
standpoint
of
men
but
don
t
let
us
talk
of
that
lord
goring
your
wife
will
forgive
you
perhaps
at
this
moment
she
is
forgiving
you
she
loves
you
robert
why
should
she
not
forgive
sir
robert
chiltern
god
grant
it
god
grant

his

the
english
think
that
a
can
solve
every
problem
in
life
why
my
dear
arthur
i
have
very
much
more
money
than
you
have
and
quite
as
much
as
robert
chiltern
has
got
hold
of
money
is
not
what
i
want
lord
goring
what
do
you
want
then
cheveley
cheveley
why
don
t
you
call
me
laura
lord
goring
i
don
t
like
the
name
cheveley
you
used
to
adore
it
lord
goring
yes
that
s
why
cheveley
to
him
to
sit
down
beside
does
cheveley
arthur
you
loved
me
once
lord
goring
yes
cheveley
and
you
asked
me
to
be
your
wife
lord
goring
that
was
the
natural
result
of
my
loving
you
cheveley
and
you
threw
me
over
because
you
saw
or
said
you
saw
poor
old
lord
mortlake
trying
to
have
a
violent
flirtation
with
me
in
the
conservatory
at
tenby
lord
goring
i
am
under
the
impression
that
my
lawyer
settled
that
matter
with
you
on
certain
terms
dictated
by
yourself
cheveley
at
that
time
i
was
poor
you
were
rich
lord
goring
quite
so
that
is
why
you
pretended
to
love
me
cheveley
her
poor
old
lord
mortlake
who
had
only
two
topics
of
conversation
his
gout
and
his
wife
i
never
could
quite
make
out
which
of
the
two
he
was
talking
about
he
used
the
most
horrible
language
about
them
both
well
you
were
silly
arthur
why
lord
mortlake
was
never
anything
more
to
me
than
an
amusement
one
of
those
utterly
tedious
amusements
one
only
finds
at
an
english
country
house
on
an
english
country
sunday
i
don
t
think
any
one
at
all
morally
responsible
for
what
he
or
she
does
at
an
english
country
house
lord
goring
yes
i
know
lots
of
people
think
that
cheveley
i
loved
you
arthur
lord
goring
my
dear
cheveley
you
have
always
been
far
too
clever
to
know
anything
about
love
cheveley
i
did
love
you
and
you
loved
me
you
know
you
loved
me
and
love
is
a
very
wonderful
thing
i
suppose
that
when
a
man
has
once
loved
a
woman
he
will
do
anything
for
her
except
continue
to
love
her
her
hand
on
lord
goring
his
hand
away
yes
except
that
cheveley
a
i
am
tired
of
living
abroad
i
want
to
come
back
to
london
i
want
to
have
a
charming
house
here
i
want
to
have
a
salon
if
one
could
only
teach
the
english
how
to
talk
and
the
irish
how
to
listen
society
here
would
be
quite
civilised
besides
i
have
arrived
at
the
romantic
stage
when
i
saw
you
last
night
at
the
chilterns
i
knew
you
were
the
only
person
i
had
ever
cared
for
if
i
ever
have
cared
for
anybody
arthur
and
so
on
the
morning
of
the
day
you
marry
me
i
will
give
you
robert
chiltern
s
letter
that
is
my
offer
i
will
give
it
to
you
now
if
you
promise
to
marry
me
lord
goring
now
cheveley
lord
goring
are
you
really
serious
cheveley
yes
quite
serious
lord
goring
i
should
make
you
a
very
bad
husband
cheveley
i
don
t
mind
bad
husbands
i
have
had
two
they
amused
me
immensely
lord
goring
you
mean
that
you
amused
yourself
immensely
don
t
you
cheveley
what
do
you
know
about
my
married
life
lord
goring
nothing
but
i
can
read
it
like
a
book
cheveley
what
book
lord
goring
the
book
of
numbers
cheveley
do
you
think
it
is
quite
charming
of
you
to
be
so
rude
to
a
woman
in
your
own
house
lord
goring
in
the
case
of
very
fascinating
women
sex
is
a
challenge
not
a
defence
cheveley
i
suppose
that
is
meant
for
a
compliment
my
dear
arthur
women
are
never
disarmed
by
compliments
men
always
are
that
is
the
difference
between
the
two
sexes
lord
goring
women
are
never
disarmed
by
anything
as
far
as
i
know
them
cheveley
a
then
you
are
going
to
allow
your
greatest
friend
robert
chiltern
to
be
ruined
rather
than
marry
some
one
who
really
has
considerable
attractions
left
i
thought
you
would
have
risen
to
some
great
height
of
arthur
i
think
you
should
and
the
rest
of
your
life
you
could
spend
in
contemplating
your
own
perfections
lord
goring
oh
i
do
that
as
it
is
and
is
a
thing
that
should
be
put
down
by
law
it
is
so
demoralising
to
the
people
for
whom
one
sacrifices
oneself
they
always
go
to
the
bad
cheveley
as
if
anything
could
demoralise
robert
chiltern
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
know
his
real
character
lord
goring
what
you
know
about
him
is
not
his
real
character
it
was
an
act
of
folly
done
in
his
youth
dishonourable
i
admit
shameful
i
admit
unworthy
of
him
i
admit
and
therefore
not
his
true
character
cheveley
how
you
men
stand
up
for
each
other
lord
goring
how
you
women
war
against
each
other
cheveley
i
only
war
against
one
woman
against
gertrude
chiltern
i
hate
her
i
hate
her
now
more
than
ever
lord
goring
because
you
have
brought
a
real
tragedy
into
her
life
i
suppose
cheveley
a
oh
there
is
only
one
real
tragedy
in
a
woman
s
life
the
fact
that
her
past
is
always
her
lover
and
her
future
invariably
her
husband
lord
goring
lady
chiltern
knows
nothing
of
the
kind
of
life
to
which
you
are
alluding
cheveley
a
woman
whose
size
in
gloves
is
seven
and
never
knows
much
about
anything
you
know
gertrude
has
always
worn
seven
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
there
was
never
any
moral
sympathy
between
us
well
arthur
i
suppose
this
romantic
interview
may
be
regarded
as
at
an
end
you
admit
it
was
romantic
don
t
you
for
the
privilege
of
being
your
wife
i
was
ready
to
surrender
a
great
prize
the
climax
of
my
diplomatic
career
you
decline
very
well
if
sir
robert
doesn
t
uphold
my
argentine
scheme
i
expose
him
voilà
tout
lord
goring
you
mustn
t
do
that
it
would
be
vile
horrible
infamous
cheveley
her
oh
don
t
use
big
words
they
mean
so
little
it
is
a
commercial
transaction
that
is
all
there
is
no
good
mixing
up
sentimentality
in
it
i
offered
to
sell
robert
chiltern
a
certain
thing
if
he
won
t
pay
me
my
price
he
will
have
to
pay
the
world
a
greater
price
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
i
must
go
won
t
you
shake
hands
lord
goring
with
you
no
your
transaction
with
robert
chiltern
may
pass
as
a
loathsome
commercial
transaction
of
a
loathsome
commercial
age
but
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
that
you
came
here
to
talk
of
love
you
whose
lips
desecrated
the
word
love
you
to
whom
the
thing
is
a
book
closely
sealed
went
this
afternoon
to
the
house
of
one
of
the
most
noble
and
gentle
women
in
the
world
to
degrade
her
husband
in
her
eyes
to
try
and
kill
her
love
for
him
to
put
poison
in
her
heart
and
bitterness
in
her
life
to
break
her
idol
and
it
may
be
spoil
her
soul
that
i
can
not
forgive
you
that
was
horrible
for
that
there
can
be
no
forgiveness
cheveley
arthur
you
are
unjust
to
me
believe
me
you
are
quite
unjust
to
me
i
didn
t
go
to
taunt
gertrude
at
all
i
had
no
idea
of
doing
anything
of
the
kind
when
i
entered
i
called
with
lady
markby
simply
to
ask
whether
an
ornament
a
jewel
that
i
lost
somewhere
last
night
had
been
found
at
the
chilterns
if
you
don
t
believe
me
you
can
ask
lady
markby
she
will
tell
you
it
is
true
the
scene
that
occurred
happened
after
lady
markby
had
left
and
was
really
forced
on
me
by
gertrude
s
rudeness
and
sneers
i
called
oh
little
out
of
malice
if
you
really
to
ask
if
a
diamond
brooch
of
mine
had
been
found
that
was
the
origin
of
the
whole
thing
lord
goring
a
diamond
with
a
ruby
cheveley
yes
how
do
you
know
lord
goring
because
it
is
found
in
point
of
fact
i
found
it
myself
and
stupidly
forgot
to
tell
the
butler
anything
about
it
as
i
was
leaving
over
to
the
and
pulls
out
the
it
is
in
this
drawer
no
that
one
this
is
the
brooch
isn
t
it
up
the
cheveley
yes
i
am
so
glad
to
get
it
back
it
was
a
present
lord
goring
won
t
you
wear
it
cheveley
certainly
if
you
pin
it
in
lord
goring
clasps
it
on
her
why
do
you
put
it
on
as
a
bracelet
i
never
knew
it
could
he
worn
as
a
bracelet
lord
goring
really
cheveley
out
her
handsome
no
but
it
looks
very
well
on
me
as
a
bracelet
doesn
t
it
lord
goring
yes
much
better
than
when
i
saw
it
last
cheveley
when
did
you
see
it
last
lord
goring
oh
ten
years
ago
on
lady
berkshire
from
whom
you
stole
it
cheveley
what
do
you
mean
lord
goring
i
mean
that
you
stole
that
ornament
from
my
cousin
mary
berkshire
to
whom
i
gave
it
when
she
was
married
suspicion
fell
on
a
wretched
servant
who
was
sent
away
in
disgrace
i
recognised
it
last
night
i
determined
to
say
nothing
about
it
till
i
had
found
the
thief
i
have
found
the
thief
now
and
i
have
heard
her
own
confession
cheveley
her
it
is
not
true
lord
goring
you
know
it
is
true
why
thief
is
written
across
your
face
at
this
moment
cheveley
i
will
deny
the
whole
affair
from
beginning
to
end
i
will
say
that
i
have
never
seen
this
wretched
thing
that
it
was
never
in
my
possession
cheveley
to
get
the
bracelet
off
her
lord
goring
on
thin
fingers
tear
at
the
jewel
to
no
curse
breaks
from
lord
goring
the
drawback
of
stealing
a
thing
cheveley
is
that
one
never
knows
how
wonderful
the
thing
that
one
steals
is
you
can
t
get
that
bracelet
off
unless
you
know
where
the
spring
is
and
i
see
you
don
t
know
where
the
spring
is
it
is
rather
difficult
to
find
cheveley
you
brute
you
coward
tries
again
to
unclasp
the
lord
goring
oh
don
t
use
big
words
they
mean
so
little
cheveley
tears
at
the
bracelet
in
a
paroxysm
of
inarticulate
looks
lord
goring
what
are
you
going
to
do
lord
goring
i
am
going
to
ring
for
my
servant
he
is
an
admirable
servant
always
comes
in
the
moment
one
rings
for
him
when
he
comes
i
will
tell
him
to
fetch
the
police
cheveley
the
police
what
for
lord
goring
the
berkshires
will
prosecute
you
that
is
what
the
police
are
for
cheveley
now
in
an
agony
of
physical
face
is
mouth
mask
has
fallen
from
the
to
look

t
do
that
i
will
do
anything

looking
rather
lord

out

rings
the
it
is
a
great
nuisance
i
can
t
find
any
one
in
this
house
to
talk
to
and
i
am
full
of
interesting
information
i
feel
like
the
latest
edition
of
something
or
other
james
sir
robert
is
still
at
the
foreign
office
my
lord
lord
goring
lady
chiltern
not

her
room
miss
chiltern

just
come
in
from
riding
lord
goring
ah

is
something
james
lord
caversham

been
waiting
some
time
in
the
library
for

t
want

meet
my
father
three
days

is
a
great
deal
too
much
excitement
for
any
son
i
hope
to
goodness

won
t
come
up
fathers

be
neither
seen
nor
heard
that
is
the
only
proper
basis
for

darlings
himself
down
into
a
up
a
paper
and
begins
to
read
lord
caversham
lord
caversham
well

are
you
doing
here
wasting
your
time
as

i
suppose
lord
goring
down
paper
and
my
dear
father
when
one
pays
a
visit
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
wasting
other
people
s
time
not
one
s
own
lord
caversham
have
you
been
thinking
over
what
i
spoke
to
you
about

goring
i
have
been
thinking
about
nothing
else
lord
caversham
engaged
to
be
married

goring
not
yet

hope
to

have
till
if
it
would
be
of
any
convenience
to
you
lord
goring

not
lord
goring

only
read
morning
all
that
one
should
know
about
modern

where
the
duchesses

quite
demoralising
lord
caversham
do
you
mean
to
say
you

into
parliament
lord
goring
my
dear
father
only
people
who
look
dull
ever
get
into
the
house
of
commons
and
only
people
who
are
dull
ever
succeed

lord
caversham
why
don
t
you
try
to
do
something
useful
in
life
lord
goring
i
am
far
too
young
lord
caversham
i
hate
this
affectation
of
youth
sir
it
is
a
great
deal
too
prevalent
nowadays
lord
goring
youth
isn
t
an
affectation
youth
is
an
art
lord
caversham
why
don
t
you
propose
to
that
pretty
miss
chiltern
lord
goring
i
am
of
a
very
nervous
disposition
especially
in
the
morning
lord
caversham
i
don
t
suppose
there
is
the
smallest
chance
of
her
accepting
you
lord
goring
i
don
t
know
how
the
betting
stands
lord
caversham
if
she
did
accept
you
she
would
be
the
prettiest
fool
in
england
lord
goring
that
is
just
what
i
should
like
to
marry
a
thoroughly
sensible
wife
would
reduce
me
to
a
condition
of
absolute
idiocy
in
less
than
six
months
lord
caversham
you
don
t
deserve
her
sir
lord
goring
my
dear
father
if
we
men
married
the
women
we
deserved
we
should
have
a
very
bad
time
of
it
mabel
chiltern
mabel
chiltern
oh
how
do
you
do
lord
caversham
i
hope
lady
caversham
is
quite
well
lord
caversham
lady
caversham
is
as
usual
as
usual
lord
goring
good
morning
miss
mabel
mabel
chiltern
no
notice
at
all
lord
goring
addressing
herself
exclusively
lord
caversham
and
lady
caversham
s
bonnets
are
they
at
all
better
lord
caversham
they
have
had
a
serious
relapse
i
am
sorry
to
say
lord
goring
good
morning
miss
mabel
mabel
chiltern
lord
caversham
i
hope
an
operation
will
not
be
necessary
lord
caversham
at
her
if
it
is
we
shall
have
to
give
lady
caversham
a
narcotic
otherwise
she
would
never
consent
to
have
a
feather
touched
lord
goring
increased
good
morning
miss
mabel
mabel
chiltern
round
with
feigned
oh
are
you
here
of
course
you
understand
that
after
your
breaking
your
appointment
i
am
never
going
to
speak
to
you
again
lord
goring
oh
please
don
t
say
such
a
thing
you
are
the
one
person
in
london
i
really
like
to
have
to
listen
to
me
mabel
chiltern
lord
goring
i
never
believe
a
single
word
that
either
you
or
i
say
to
each
other
lord
caversham
you
are
quite
right
my
dear
quite
right
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
i
mean
mabel
chiltern
do
you
think
you
could
possibly
make
your
son
behave
a
little
better
occasionally
just
as
a
change
lord
caversham
i
regret
to
say
miss
chiltern
that
i
have
no
influence
at
all
over
my
son
i
wish
i
had
if
i
had
i
know
what
i
would
make
him
do
mabel
chiltern
i
am
afraid
that
he
has
one
of
those
terribly
weak
natures
that
are
not
susceptible
to
influence
lord
caversham
he
is
very
heartless
very
heartless
lord
goring
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
a
little
in
the
way
here
mabel
chiltern
it
is
very
good
for
you
to
be
in
the
way
and
to
know
what
people
say
of
you
behind
your
back
lord
goring
i
don
t
at
all
like
knowing
what
people
say
of
me
behind
my
back
it
makes
me
far
too
conceited
lord
caversham
after
that
my
dear
i
really
must
bid
you
good
morning
mabel
chiltern
oh
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
leave
me
all
alone
with
lord
goring
especially
at
such
an
early
hour
in
the
day
lord
caversham
i
am
afraid
i
can
t
take
him
with
me
to
downing
street
it
is
not
the
prime
minster
s
day
for
seeing
the
unemployed
hands
mabel
chiltern
up
his
hat
and
goes
a
parting
glare
of
indignation
lord
goring
mabel
chiltern
up
roses
and
begins
to
arrange
them
in
a
bowl
on
the
people
who
don
t
keep
their
appointments
in
the
park
are
horrid
lord
goring
detestable
mabel
chiltern
i
am
glad
you
admit
it
but
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
look
so
pleased
about
it
lord
goring
i
can
t
help
it
i
always
look
pleased
when
i
am
with
you
mabel
chiltern
then
i
suppose
it
is
my
duty
to
remain
with
you
lord
goring
of
course
it
is
mabel
chiltern
well
my
duty
is
a
thing
i
never
do
on
principle
it
always
depresses
me
so
i
am
afraid
i
must
leave
you
lord
goring
please
don
t
miss
mabel
i
have
something
very
particular
to
say
to
you
mabel
chiltern
oh
is
it
a
proposal
lord
goring
taken
well
yes
it
am
bound
to
say
it
is
mabel
chiltern
a
sigh
of
i
am
so
glad
that
makes
the
second
lord
goring
the
second
what
conceited
ass
has
been
impertinent
enough
to
dare
to
propose
to
you
before
i
had
proposed
to
you
mabel
chiltern
tommy
trafford
of
course
it
is
one
of
tommy
s
days
for
proposing
he
always
proposes
on
tuesdays
and
thursdays
during
the
season
lord
goring
you
didn
t
accept
him
i
hope
mabel
chiltern
i
make
it
a
rule
never
to
accept
tommy
that
is
why
he
goes
on
proposing
of
course
as
you
didn
t
turn
up
this
morning
i
very
nearly
said
yes
it
would
have
been
an
excellent
lesson
both
for
him
and
for
you
if
i
had
it
would
have
taught
you
both
better
manners
lord
goring
oh
bother
tommy
trafford
tommy
is
a
silly
little
ass
i
love
you
mabel
chiltern
i
know
and
i
think
you
might
have
mentioned
it
before
i
am
sure
i
have
given
you
heaps
of
opportunities
lord
goring
mabel
do
be
serious
please
be
serious
mabel
chiltern
ah
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
a
man
always
says
to
a
girl
before
he
has
been
married
to
her
he
never
says
it
afterwards
lord
goring
hold
of
her
mabel
i
have
told
you
that
i
love
you

t
you
love
me
a
little
in
return

chiltern
you
silly
arthur

anything
about
anything
which
you
don
t
you
would
know
that
i
adore
you
every
one
in
london

it
except
you

is
a
public
scandal

way

you

have
been
going
about
for
the
last
six
months
telling
the
whole
of
society
that

adore
you

wonder
you
consent
to
have
anything
to
say
to
me
i
have
no
character
left
at
all
at
least
i
feel
so
happy
that
i
am
quite
sure
i
have
no
character
left
at
all
lord

his
arms
and

something
to
tell

distresses
me
yesterday
evening

wrote

a
very
beautiful
womanly
letter
asking
me
for
my
help
you
wrote
to
me
as
one
of
your
oldest
friends
one
of
your
husband
s
oldest
friends
cheveley
stole
that
letter
from
my
rooms

not
have
it
lord

certain
construction
on

but
what
construction
could
she
put
on
it
oh

not

wanting
your
help
trusting
you
propose
to
come
to
you
that
you
may
advise
me

women
so
horrible
as
that
and
she
proposes
to
send
it
to
my
husband
tell
me
what

tell
me
all
that
happened
lord
goring
cheveley
was
concealed
in
a
room
adjoining
my
library
without
my
knowledge
i
thought
that
the
person
who
was
waiting
in
that
room
to
see
me
was
yourself
robert
came
in
unexpectedly
a
chair
or
something
fell
in
the
room
he
forced
his
way
in
and
he
discovered
her
we
had
a
terrible
scene
i
still
thought
it
was
you
he
left
me
in
anger
at
the
end
of
everything
cheveley
got
possession
of
your
stole
it
when
or
how
i
don
t
know
lady
chiltern
at
what
hour
did
this
happen
lord
goring
at
ten
and
now
i
propose
that
we
tell
robert
the
whole
thing
at
once
lady
chiltern
at
him
with
amazement
that
is
almost
you
want
me
to
tell
robert
that
the
woman
you
expected
was
not
cheveley
but
myself
that
it
was
i
whom
you
thought
was
concealed
in
a
room
in
your
house
at
ten
o
clock
at
night
you
want
me
to
tell
him
that
lord
goring
i
think
it
is
better
that
he
should
know
the
exact
truth
lady
chiltern
oh
i
couldn
t
i
couldn
t
lord
goring
may
i
do
it
lady
chiltern
no
lord
goring
you
are
wrong
lady
chiltern
lady
chiltern
no
the
letter
must
be
intercepted
that
is
all
but
how
can
i
do
it
letters
arrive
for
him
every
moment
of
the
day
his
secretaries
open
them
and
hand
them
to
him
i
dare
not
ask
the
servants
to
bring
me
his
letters
it
would
be
impossible
oh
why
don
t
you
tell
me
what
to
do
lord
goring
pray
be
calm
lady
chiltern
and
answer
the
questions
i
am
going
to
put
to
you
you
said
his
secretaries
open
his
letters
lady
chiltern
yes
lord
goring
who
is
with
him
trafford
isn
t
it
lady
chiltern
no
montford
i
think
lord
goring
you
can
trust
him
lady
chiltern
a
gesture
of
oh
how
do
i
know
lord
goring
he
would
do
what
you
asked
him
wouldn
t
he
lady
chiltern
i
think
so
lord
goring
your
letter
was
on
pink
paper
he
could
recognise
it
without
reading
it
couldn
t
he
by
the
colour
lady
chiltern
i
suppose
so
lord
goring
is
he
in
the
house
now
lady
chiltern
yes
lord
goring
then
i
will
go
and
see
him
myself
and
tell
him
that
a
certain
letter
written
on
pink
paper
is
to
be
forwarded
to
robert
and
that
at
all
costs
it
must
not
reach
him
to
the
opens
oh
robert
is
coming
upstairs
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
it
has
reached
him
already
lady
chiltern
a
cry
of
oh

have
saved
his
life
what
have
you
done
with
mine

of

letter
of
yours

conservatory

talk
to

what
about
sir
lord
goring
about
me
father
lord
caversham
not
a
subject
on
which
much
eloquence
is
possible
lord
goring
no
father
but
the
lady
is
like
me
she
doesn
t
care
much
for
eloquence
in
others
she
thinks
it
a
little
loud
lord
caversham
out
into
the
lady
chiltern
lord
goring
lady
chiltern
why
are
you
playing
cheveley
s
cards
lady
chiltern
i
don
t
understand
you
lord
goring
cheveley
made
an
attempt
to
ruin
your
husband
either
to
drive
him
from
public
life
or
to
make
him
adopt
a
dishonourable
position
from
the
latter
tragedy
you
saved
him
the
former
you
are
now
thrusting
on
him
why
should
you
do
him
the
wrong
cheveley
tried
to
do
and
failed
lady
chiltern
lord
goring
lord
goring
himself
together
for
a
great
showing
the
philosopher
that
underlies
the
lady
chiltern
allow
me
you
wrote
me
a
letter
last
night
in
which
you
said
you
trusted
me
and
wanted
my
help
now
is
the
moment
when
you
really
want
my
help
now
is
the
time
when
you
have
got
to
trust
me
to
trust
in
my
counsel
and
judgment
you
love
robert
do
you
want
to
kill
his
love
for
you
what
sort
of
existence
will
he
have
if
you
rob
him
of
the
fruits
of
his
ambition
if
you
take
him
from
the
splendour
of
a
great
political
career
if
you
close
the
doors
of
public
life
against
him
if
you
condemn
him
to
sterile
failure
he
who
was
made
for
triumph
and
success
women
are
not
meant
to
judge
us
but
to
forgive
us
when
we
need
forgiveness
pardon
not
punishment
is
their
mission
why
should
you
scourge
him
with
rods
for
a
sin
done
in
his
youth
before
he
knew
you
before
he
knew
himself
a
man
s
life
is
of
more
value
than
a
woman
s
it
has
larger
issues
wider
scope
greater
ambitions
a
woman
s
life
revolves
in
curves
of
emotions
it
is
upon
lines
of
intellect
that
a
man
s
life
progresses
don
t
make
any
terrible
mistake
lady
chiltern
a
woman
who
can
keep
a
man
s
love
and
love
him
in
return
has
done
all
the
world
wants
of
women
or
should
want
of
them
lady
chiltern
and
but
it
is
my
husband
himself
who
wishes
to
retire
from
public
life
he
feels
it
is
his
duty
it
was
he
who
first
said
so
lord
goring
rather
than
lose
your
love
robert
would
do
anything
wreck
his
whole
career
as
he
is
on
the
brink
of
doing
now
he
is
making
for
you
a
terrible
sacrifice
take
my
advice
lady
chiltern
and
do
not
accept
a
sacrifice
so
great
if
you
do
you
will
live
to
repent
it
bitterly
we
men
and
women
are
not
made
to
accept
such
sacrifices
from
each
other
we
are
not
worthy
of
them
besides
robert
has
been
punished
enough
lady
chiltern
we
have
both
been
punished
i
set
him
up
too
high
lord
goring
deep
feeling
in
his
do
not
for
that
reason
set
him
down
now
too
low
if
he
has
fallen
from
his
altar
do
not
thrust
him
into
the
mire
failure
to
robert
would
be
the
very
mire
of
shame
power
is
his
passion
he
would
lose
everything
even
his
power
to
feel
love
your
husband
s
life
is
at
this
moment
in
your
hands
your
husband
s
love
is
in
your
hands
don
t
mar
both
for
him
sir
robert
chiltern
sir
robert
chiltern
gertrude
here
is
the
draft
of
my
letter
shall
i
read
it
to
you
lady
chiltern
let
me
see
it
sir
robert
her
the
reads
a
gesture
of
it
sir
robert
chiltern
what
are
you
doing
lady
chiltern
a
man
s
life
is
of
more
value
than
a
woman
s
it
has
larger
issues
wider
scope
greater
ambitions
our
lives
revolve
in
curves
of
emotions
it
is
upon
lines
of
intellect
that
a
man
s
life
progresses
i
have
just
learnt
this
and
much
else
with
it
from
lord
goring
and
i
will
not
spoil
your
life
for
you
nor
see
you
spoil
it
as
a
sacrifice
to
me
a
useless
sacrifice
sir
robert
chiltern
gertrude
gertrude
lady
chiltern
you
can
forget
men
easily
forget
and
i
forgive
that
is
how
women
help
the
world
i
see
that
now
sir
robert
chiltern
overcome
by
my
wife
my
wife
lord
goring
arthur
it
seems
that
i
am
always
to
be
in
your
debt
lord
goring
oh
dear
no
robert
your
debt
is
to
lady
chiltern
not
to
me
sir
robert
chiltern
i
owe
you
much
and
now
tell
me
what
you
were
going
to
ask
me
just
now
as
lord
caversham
came
in
lord
goring
robert
you
are
your
sister
s
guardian
and
i
want
your
consent
to
my
marriage
with
her
that
is
all
lady
chiltern
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
am
so
glad
hands
lord
goring
lord
goring
thank
you
lady
chiltern
sir
robert
chiltern
a
troubled
my
sister
to
be
your
wife
lord
goring
yes
sir
robert
chiltern
with
great
arthur
i
am
very
sorry
but
the
thing
is
quite
out
of
the
question
i
have
to
think
of
mabel
s
future
happiness
and
i
don
t
think
her
happiness
would
be
safe
in
your
hands
and
i
can
not
have
her
sacrificed
lord
goring
sacrificed
sir
robert
chiltern
yes
utterly
sacrificed
loveless
marriages
are
horrible
but
there
is
one
thing
worse
than
an
absolutely
loveless
marriage
a
marriage
in
which
there
is
love
but
on
one
side
only
faith
but
on
one
side
only
devotion
but
on
one
side
only
and
in
which
of
the
two
hearts
one
is
sure
to
be
broken
lord
goring
but
i
love
mabel
no
other
woman
has
any
place
in
my
life
lady
chiltern
robert
if
they
love
each
other
why
should
they
not
be
married
sir
robert
chiltern
arthur
can
not
bring
mabel
the
love
that
she
deserves
lord
goring
what
reason
have
you
for
saying
that
sir
robert
chiltern
a
do
you
really
require
me
to
tell
you
lord
goring
certainly
i
do
sir
robert
chiltern
as
you
choose
when
i
called
on
you
yesterday
evening
i
found
cheveley
concealed
in
your
rooms
it
was
between
ten
and
eleven
o
clock
at
night
i
do
not
wish
to
say
anything
more
your
relations
with
cheveley
have
as
i
said
to
you
last
night
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
me
i
know
you
were
engaged
to
be
married
to
her
once
the
fascination
she
exercised
over
you
then
seems
to
have
returned
you
spoke
to
me
last
night
of
her
as
of
a
woman
pure
and
stainless
a
woman
whom
you
respected
and
honoured
that
may
be
so
but
i
can
not
give
my
sister
s
life
into
your
hands
it
would
be
wrong
of
me
it
would
be
unjust
infamously
unjust
to
her
lord
goring
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
lady
chiltern
robert
it
was
not
cheveley
whom
lord
goring
expected
last
night
sir
robert
chiltern
not
cheveley
who
was
it
then
lord
goring
lady
chiltern
lady
chiltern
it
was
your
own
wife
robert
yesterday
afternoon
lord
goring
told
me
that
if
ever
i
was
in
trouble
i
could
come
to
him
for
help
as
he
was
our
oldest
and
best
friend
later
on
after
that
terrible
scene
in
this
room
i
wrote
to
him
telling
him
that
i
trusted
him
that
i
had
need
of
him
that
i
was
coming
to
him
for
help
and
advice
sir
robert
chiltern
the
letter
out
of
his
yes
that
letter
i
didn
t
go
to
lord
goring
s
after
all
i
felt
that
it
is
from
ourselves
alone
that
help
can
come
pride
made
me
think
that
cheveley
went
she
stole
my
letter
and
sent
it
anonymously
to
you
this
morning
that
you
should
think
oh
robert
i
can
not
tell
you
what
she
wished
you
to
think
sir
robert
chiltern
what
had
i
fallen
so
low
in
your
eyes
that
you
thought
that
even
for
a
moment
i
could
have
doubted
your
goodness
gertrude
gertrude
you
are
to
me
the
white
image
of
all
good
things
and
sin
can
never
touch
you
arthur
you
can
go
to
mabel
and
you
have
my
best
wishes
oh
stop
a
moment
there
is
no
name
at
the
beginning
of
this
letter
the
brilliant
cheveley
does
not
seem
to
have
noticed
that
there
should
be
a
name
lady
chiltern
let
me
write
yours
it
is
you
i
trust
and
need
you
and
none
else
lord
goring
well
really
lady
chiltern
i
think
i
should
have
back
my
own
letter
lady
chiltern
no
you
shall
have
mabel
the
letter
and
writes
her
husband
s
name
on
lord
goring
well
i
hope
she
hasn
t
changed
her
mind
it
s
nearly
twenty
minutes
since
i
saw
her
last
mabel
chiltern
lord
caversham
mabel
chiltern
lord
goring
i
think
your
father
s
conversation
much
more
improving
than
yours
i
am
only
going
to
talk
to
lord
caversham
in
the
future
and
always
under
the
usual
palm
tree
lord
goring
darling
lord
caversham
taken
what
does
this
mean
sir
you
don
t
mean
to
say
that
this
charming
clever
young
lady
has
been
so
foolish
as
to
accept
you
lord
goring
certainly
father
and
chiltern
s
been
wise
enough
to
accept
the
seat
in
the
cabinet
lord
caversham
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
that
chiltern
i
congratulate
you
sir

for

goring
but
your
career
will
have
to
be
entirely
domestic

don
t

shilling
