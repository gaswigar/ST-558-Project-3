the
pretentious
young
ladies
a
comedy
in
one
act
original
in
introductory
notice
molière
began
in
pretentious
young
to
paint
men
and
women
as
they
are
to
make
living
characters
and
existing
manners
the
of
his
plays
from
that
time
he
abandoned
all
imitation
of
italian
or
spanish
imbroglios
and
intrigues
there
is
no
doubt
that
aristocratic
society
attempted
about
the
latter
years
of
the
reign
of
louis
to
amend
the
coarse
and
licentious
expressions
which
during
the
civil
wars
had
been
introduced
into
literature
as
well
as
into
manners
it
was
praiseworthy
of
some
ladies
in
parisian
society
to
endeavour
to
refine
the
language
and
the
mind
but
there
was
a
very
great
difference
between
the
influence
these
ladies
exercised
from
until
and
what
took
place
in
the
year
when
molière
returned
to
paris
the
hôtel
de
rambouillet
and
the
aristocratic
had
then
done
their
work
and
done
it
well
but
they
were
succeeded
by
a
clique
which
cared
only
for
what
was
nicely
said
or
rather
what
was
out
of
the
common
instead
of
using
an
elegant
and
refined
diction
they
employed
only
a
pretentious
and
conceitedly
affected
style
which
became
highly
ridiculous
instead
of
improving
the
national
idiom
they
completely
spoilt
it
where
formerly
malherbe
racan
balzac
and
voiture
reigned
chapelain
scudéry
ménage
and
the
abbé
cotin
the
father
of
the
french
riddle
ruled
in
their
stead
moreover
every
lady
in
paris
as
well
as
in
the
provinces
no
matter
what
her
education
was
held
her
where
nothing
was
heard
but
a
ridiculous
exaggerated
and
what
was
worse
a
borrowed
phraseology
the
novels
of
mdlle
de
scudéry
became
the
of
the
and
the
for
such
was
the
name
given
to
these
gentlemen
and
ladies
who
set
up
for
wits
and
thought
they
displayed
exquisite
taste
refined
ideas
fastidious
judgment
and
consummate
and
critical
discrimination
whilst
they
only
uttered
vapid
and
blatant
nonsense
what
other
language
can
be
used
when
we
find
that
they
called
the
sun
éclairant
le
plus
beau
du
monde
de
la
and
that
when
speaking
of
an
old
gentleman
with
grey
hair
they
said
not
as
a
joke
but
seriously
a
des
quittances
a
few
of
their
expressions
however
are
employed
even
at
the
present
time
such
as
son
to
correct
style
une
to
spend
an
hour
ses
pensées
to
clothe
one
thoughts
in
noble
expressions
etc
though
the
and
had
been
several
times
attacked
before
it
remained
for
molière
to
give
them
their
death
blow
and
after
the
performance
of
his
comedy
the
name
became
a
term
of
ridicule
and
contumely
what
enhanced
the
bitterness
of
the
attack
was
the
difference
between
molière
natural
style
and
the
affected
tone
of
the
elegants
he
brought
upon
the
stage
this
comedy
in
prose
was
first
acted
at
paris
at
the
théâtre
du
petit
bourbon
on
the
of
november
and
met
with
great
success
through
the
influence
of
some
noble
and
it
was
forbidden
until
the
of
december
when
the
concourse
of
spectators
was
so
great
that
it
had
to
be
performed
twice
a
day
that
the
prices
of
nearly
all
the
places
were
raised
see
note
page
xxv
and
that
it
ran
for
four
months
together
we
have
referred
in
our
prefatory
memoir
of
molière
to
some
of
the
legendary
anecdotes
connected
with
this
play
it
has
also
been
said
that
our
author
owed
perhaps
the
first
idea
of
this
play
to
a
work
cercle
des
femmes
ou
le
secret
du
lit
nuptial
entretiens
written
by
a
author
samuel
chapuzeau
in
which
a
servant
dressed
in
his
clothes
is
well
received
by
a
certain
lady
who
had
rejected
the
master
but
as
the
witty
dialogue
is
the
principal
merit
in
molière
play
it
is
really
of
no
great
consequence
who
first
suggested
the
primary
idea
the
piece
though
played
in
was
only
printed
on
the
of
january
by
guillaume
de
luyne
a
bookseller
in
paris
with
a
preface
by
molière
which
we
give
here
below
a
strange
thing
it
is
that
people
should
be
put
in
print
against
their
will
i
know
nothing
so
unjust
and
should
pardon
any
other
violence
much
sooner
than
that
not
that
i
here
intend
to
personate
the
bashful
author
and
out
of
a
point
of
honour
undervalue
my
comedy
i
should
very
unseasonably
disoblige
all
the
people
of
paris
should
i
accuse
them
of
having
applauded
a
foolish
thing
as
the
public
is
absolute
judge
of
such
sort
of
works
it
would
be
impertinence
in
me
to
contradict
it
and
even
if
i
should
have
had
the
worst
opinion
in
the
world
of
my
young
before
they
appeared
upon
the
stage
i
must
now
believe
them
of
some
value
since
so
many
people
agree
to
speak
in
their
behalf
but
as
great
part
of
the
pleasure
it
gave
depends
upon
the
action
and
tone
of
the
voice
it
behooved
me
not
to
let
them
be
deprived
of
those
ornaments
and
that
success
they
had
in
the
representation
was
i
thought
sufficiently
favorable
for
me
to
stop
there
i
was
i
say
determined
to
let
them
only
be
seen
by
candlelight
that
i
might
give
no
room
for
any
one
to
use
the
proverb
footnote
in
molière
time
it
was
proverbially
said
of
a
woman
est
belle
a
la
chandelle
mais
le
grand
jour
gate
she
is
beautiful
by
but
spoils
everything
nor
was
i
willing
they
should
leap
from
the
theatre
de
bourbon
into
the
du
footnote
the
du
was
the
place
where
molière
publisher
lived
notwithstanding
i
have
been
unable
to
avoid
it
and
am
fallen
under
the
misfortune
of
seeing
a
surreptitious
copy
of
my
play
in
the
hands
of
the
booksellers
together
with
a
privilege
knavishly
obtained
for
printing
it
i
cried
out
in
vain
o
times
o
manners
they
showed
me
that
there
was
a
necessity
for
me
to
be
in
print
or
have
a
and
the
last
evil
is
even
worse
than
the
first
fate
therefore
must
be
submitted
to
and
i
must
consent
to
a
thing
which
they
would
not
fail
to
do
without
me
lord
the
strange
perplexity
of
sending
a
book
abroad
and
what
an
awkward
figure
an
author
makes
the
first
time
he
appears
in
print
had
they
allowed
me
time
i
should
have
thought
it
over
better
and
have
taken
all
those
precautions
which
the
gentlemen
authors
who
are
now
my
brethren
commonly
make
use
of
upon
the
like
occasions
besides
some
noble
lord
whom
i
should
have
chosen
in
spite
of
his
teeth
to
be
the
patron
of
my
work
and
whose
generosity
i
should
have
excited
by
an
epistle
dedicatory
very
elegantly
composed
i
should
have
endeavoured
to
make
a
fine
and
learned
preface
nor
do
i
want
books
which
would
have
supplied
me
with
all
that
can
be
said
in
a
scholarly
manner
upon
tragedy
and
comedy
the
etymology
of
them
both
their
origin
their
definition
and
so
forth
i
should
likewise
have
spoken
to
my
friends
who
to
recommend
my
performance
would
not
have
refused
me
verses
either
in
french
or
latin
i
have
even
some
that
would
have
praised
me
in
greek
and
nobody
is
ignorant
that
a
commendation
in
greek
is
of
a
marvellous
efficacy
at
the
beginning
of
a
book
but
i
am
sent
abroad
without
giving
me
time
to
look
about
me
and
i
ca
so
much
as
obtain
the
liberty
of
speaking
two
words
to
justify
my
intention
as
to
the
subject
of
this
comedy
i
would
willingly
have
shewn
that
it
is
confined
throughout
within
the
bounds
of
allowable
and
decent
satire
that
things
the
most
excellent
are
liable
to
be
mimicked
by
wretched
apes
who
deserve
to
be
ridiculed
that
these
absurd
imitations
of
what
is
most
perfect
have
been
at
all
times
the
subject
of
comedy
and
that
for
the
same
reason
that
the
truly
learned
and
truly
brave
never
yet
thought
fit
to
be
offended
at
the
doctor
or
the
captain
in
a
comedy
no
more
than
judges
princes
and
kings
at
seeing
trivelin
footnote
the
doctor
and
the
captain
were
traditional
personages
of
the
italian
stage
their
parts
need
no
further
explanation
trivelin
was
a
popular
italian
actor
who
in
a
humorous
and
exaggerated
way
played
the
parts
of
judges
princes
and
kings
or
any
other
upon
the
stage
ridiculously
act
the
judge
the
prince
or
king
so
the
true
would
be
in
the
wrong
to
be
angry
when
the
pretentious
ones
are
exposed
who
imitate
them
awkwardly

it

of

kind
to
bedeck
with
all
perfections
those
to
whom
they
present
their

that
dedications
are
by

people
at

interpreted
like

le
bas
is
exquisitely
charming
the
following
comedy
of
moliere
that
celebrated
dramatick
writer
was
by
him
intended
to
reprove
a
vain
fantastical
conceited
and
preposterous
humour
which
about
that
time
prevailed
very
much
in
it
had
the
desir
good
effect
and
conduced
a
great
deal
towards
rooting
out
a
taste
so
unreasonable
and
pride
conceit
vanity
and
affectation
are
foibles
so
often
found
amongst
the
fair
sex
at
present
i
have
attempted
this
translation
in
hopes
of
doing
service
to
my
pretty
and
certainly
it
must
have
a
double
efficacy
under
the
patronage
of
one
who
is
so
bright
an
example
of
the
contrary
fine
accomplishments
which
a
large
fortune
makes
her
not
the
less
careful
to
improve
i
am
not
so
presumptuous
to
imagine
that
my
can
do
sufficient
justice
to
the
sense
of
this
admir
author
and
therefore
have
caused
the
original

be
placed

that
both
together
may
prove
an
agreeable

there
breathes
in

is
something
plaintive
in

you
not
think
that
the

perfectly
well
expresses
the
sentiment
thief
stop
thief

then
as

cried
out
very
loud
stop
stop
stop
stop
stop
thief

all
at

this
is
to

the
perfection
of

the
grand
perfection
the
perfection
of
perfections
i
declare
it
is
altogether
a
wonderful
performance
i
am
quite
enchanted
with
the
air
and
the
words
cat
i
never
yet
met
with
anything
so
excellent
masc
all
that
i
do
comes
naturally

it
is
without

nature
has
treated
you

a
very
fond
mother
you

darling
child

how
do
you
pass
away
the
time
ladies
cat
with
nothing
at

until
now
we
have
lived
in
a
terrible
dearth
of
amusements
masc
i
am
at
your
service
to
attend
you
to
the
play
one
of
those
days
if
you
will
permit
me
indeed
a
new
comedy
is
to
be
acted
which
i
should
be
very
glad
we
might
see
together

there
is
no
refusing
you
anything

i
beg
of
you
to
applaud
it
well
when
we
shall
be
there

i
have
promised
to
give
a
helping
hand
to
the
piece
the
author
called
upon
me
this
very
morning
to
beg
me
so
to
do
it
is
the
custom
for
authors
to
come
and
read
their
new
plays
to
people
of
rank
that
they
may
induce
us
to
approve
of
them
and
give
them
a
reputation
i
leave
you
to
imagine
if
when
we
say
anything
the
pit
dares
contradict
us
as
for
me
i
am
very
punctual
in
these
things
and
when
i
have
made
a
promise
to
a
poet
i
always
cry
out
bravo
before
the
candles
are
lighted

not
say
another

however
clever

have
no
idea

consider

our
duty
to
cry
up
lustily
every
word
that
is
said

i
do
not
know
whether
i
am
deceived

you
look
as
if
you
had
written
some
play
yourself
mad
eh
there
may
be
something
in
what
you
say
masc
ah
upon
my
word
we
must
see
it
between
ourselves
i
have
written
one
which
i
intend

have
brought

you
mean

is
a

question

to
the

alone
can
bring

are
ignorant

recite
their

people
speak
in

they
do
not
understand
to
mouth
the
verses

to
pause
at
a
beautiful
passage
how
can
it
be
known
where
the
fine
lines
are
if
an

does
not
stop
at
them

thereby
tell
you
to
applaud
heartily
