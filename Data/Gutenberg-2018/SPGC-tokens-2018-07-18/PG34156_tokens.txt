the

i
the
sun
beat
fiercely
on
the
square
in
front
of
a
provincial
railway
station
the
old
white
mare
nodded
drowsily
between
the
shafts
of
the
yellow
mailcart
which
rattled
down
from
the
little
town
to
meet
every
train
two
or
three
hotel
omnibuses
painted
with
wheels
also
came
clattering
down
the
dusty
boulevard
at
the
other
end
of
which
rose
two
stucco
towers
with
their
vanes
piercing
the
deep
blue
of
the
july
sky
a
clanging
bell
had
already
signalled
the
train
departure
from
the
neighbouring
station
the
put
on
his
red
cap
the
barmaid
began
to
wipe
with
a
duster
the
glass
case
protecting
the
cheese
and
other
viands
and
a
couple
of
postmen
crunched
over
the
gravel
wheeling
trucks
containing
and
parcels
not
a
single
soul
inside
again
grumbled
the
through
the
window
as
he
watched
the
hotel
omnibus
drive
up
what
is
the
use
of
keeping
beer
cool
if
nobody
comes
to
drink
it
the
barmaid
nodded
meditatively
as
she
flicked
the
flies
from
a
pile
of
stale
rusks
then
there
came
in
sight
dashing
along
the
boulevard
an
open
landau
drawn
by
a
pair
of
spirited
bays
the
face
brightened
the
party
from
stolten
court
exclaimed
he
seizing
his
cap
the
young
gentlemen
leave
is
over
then
the
carriage
steered
clear
of
waiting
passengers
with
a
sweeping
curve
as
it
bowled
up
to
the
station
stairs
one
of
the
young
cuirassier
officers
who
occupied
the
back
seat
of
the
carriage
pulled
himself
slowly
erect
and
in
all
his
splendour
climbed
out
pushing
aside
with
a
brusque
movement
the
who
had
officiously
thought
it
necessary
to
tender
his
services
the
other
youth
equally
gigantic
and
and
perhaps
a
trifle
more
phlegmatic
followed
they
threw
open
on
either
side
the
carriage
doors
and
with
an
action
of
the
arm
that
seemed
borrowed
from
a
court
quadrille
assisted
the
stupendous
female
form
sitting
on
the
front
seat
of
the
carriage
to
alight
with
swelling
bosom
and
hips
her
fat
hands
imprisoned
in
new
light
kid
gloves
her
grey
gauze
veil
thrown
back
displaying
a
snub
nose
the
lady
calmly
descended
with
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
of
somewhat
sharp
disapproval
at
the
old
gentleman
who
followed
her
leave
me
alone
boys
he
snapped
when
his
sons
would
have
helped
him
too
your
old
father
is
still
able
to
help
himself
he
threw
off
his
on
the
seat
behind
him
and
with
an
elastic
bound
sprang
down
without
touching
the
carriage
steps
he
stood
there
a
dapper
figure
in
his
short
elegantly
cut
coat
his
little
eyes
twinkling
with
out
of
a
face
lined
from
fast
living
the
cheeks
of
which
hung
down
on
either
side
of
an
aggressively
grey
moustache
he
had
to
look
up
to
his
wife
and
sons
who
were
all
more
than
a
head
taller
than
himself
the
party
entered
the
small
reserved
for
passengers
which
besides
two
bare
polished
tables
and
portraits
in
lithograph
veiled
in
green
gauze
of
the
county
nobility
and
gentry
boasted
nothing
but
apparatuses
for
the
annihilation
of
flies
which
consisted
of
a
glass
bottle
full
of
soapy
water
two
plates
containing
poisoned
paper
and
a
few
glasses
covered
with
bread
bored
with
holes
within
and
around
these
traps
revolved
hundreds
of
and
poisoned
flies
in
their
last
the
host
of
the
restaurant
offered
his
refreshments
to
the
herr
baron
königsberg
beer
or
tea
also
an
incomparably
fine
brew
of
lemonade
were
to
be
had
herr
von
stolt
ordered
beer
and
sent
his
sons
out
to
look
after
their
luggage
they
closed
the
door
behind
them
as
they
took
their
leave
and
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
buffet
where
they
were
soon
heard
chaffing
the
barmaid
thank
god
that
they
are
going
away
said
the
lady
with
a
sigh
loosening
her
violet
from
which
a
broad
double
chin
billowed
forth
it
is
high
time
her
spouse
suppressed
a
smile
and
then
asked
why
have
you
seen
anything
of
either
of
them
between
during
the
last
fortnight
she
answered
with
another
question
now
now
it
is
not
so
bad
as
all
that
repeated
he
but
as
you
say
they
were
certainly
out
a
good
deal
and
where
did
they
go
that
is
the
point
well
where
should
they
go
to
the
prussian
crown
or
some
such
resort
to
drink
a
little
champagne
and
amuse
themselves
with
the
girls
i
did
the
same
when
i
was
their
age
and
you
are
much
better
now
really
i
must
protest
malwine
she
drew
herself
up
and
measured
him
from
head
to
foot
with
the
compassionate
glance
of
a
wife
to
whom
marital
forgiveness
has
perforce
become
a
habit
we
wo
drag
you
into
the
matter
my
dear
she
answered
you
know
no
good
can
come
of
it
neither
do
i
reproach
the
boys
on
that
score
they
are
welcome
to
run
after
all
the
girls
in
the
neighbourhood
whether
dairymaids
or
barmaids
to
their
hearts
content
you
are
very
malwine
certainly
i
am
but
what
does
please
me
is
that
my
sons
should
grow
too
fond
of
society
women
married
women
belonging
to
our
own
set
too
königsberg
for
two
cuirassiers
who
have
inherited
money
from
their
father
and
height
from
their
mother
that
i
am
shorter
than
you
are
dear
malwine
he
interrupted
is
a
fact
that
i
am
weary
of
hearing
you
insist
on
i
will
do
my
best
to
grow
i
was
going
to
say
she
continued
that
königsberg
is
not
exactly
a
paradise
of
all
the
virtues
quite
the
contrary
a
maternal
sigh
escaped
her
huge
billowy
bosom
all
the
more
important
therefore
that
home
should
remain
for
them
a
purer
world
tell
me
what
would
happen
when
they
begin
to
regard
the
circle
from
which
i
shall
one
day
choose
for
them
wives
with
critical
eyes
and
why
because
there
are
creatures
in
it
who
have
no
idea
of
maintaining
their
dignity
in
associating
with
young
men
upon
my
word
i
do
know
what
you
are
driving
at
herr
von
stolt
said
and
gazed
intently
at
the
toes
of
his
why
feign
to
be
ignorant
answered
his
wife
you
know
perfectly
well
the
person
i
mean
being
as
intimate
with
her
as
your
sons
i
have
long
since
given
up
meddling
in
local
scandals
my
dear
he
said
with
a
snigger
but
if
with
all
these
obscure
hints
it
is
felicitas
kletzingk
whom
you
mean
you
are
decidedly
on
the
wrong
scent
there
never
was
a
more
guileless
little
woman
we
know
what
ulrich
is
he
is
always
either
spending
the
day
in
berlin
or
sitting
lost
in
a
brown
study
and
his
little
wife
of
course
will
amuse
herself
frau
von
stolt
broke
into
a
harsh
laugh
of
course
now
let
us
hear
the
old
category
of
her
perfections
she
is
an
angel
on
that
point
all
the
men
within
a
circuit
of
ten
miles
are
agreed
she
is
so
ingenuous
and
so
melancholy
so
talented
and
so
good
so
gentle
and
in
short
a
paragon
but
we
women
see
deeper
my
friend
we
are
not
to
be
taken
in
by
any
wiles
tones
and
smiling
eyes
then
for
us
truly
there
lies
behind
it
all
no
temptation
to
appropriate
what
is
not
our
own
malwine
you
are
becoming
insulting
retorted
herr
von
stolt
twirling
the
ends
of
his
grey
moustache
with
an
injured
air
if
only
there
were
something
in
her
the
lady
exclaimed
undaunted
but
i
assure
you
she
is
commonplace
to
the
very
core
there
is
nothing
genuine
about
her
she
has
her
looks
and
nothing
else
i
conceive
what
can
have
attracted
ulrich
with
his
position
and
fortune
to
this
person
rhaden
widow
poor
with
a
child
and
compromised
to
boot
how
compromised
do
be
absurd
alfred
was
the
reply
you
men
have
always
been
of
opinion
that
rhaden
fell
in
the
duel
with
sellenthin
because
there
was
a
case
of
adultery
at
the
bottom
of
it
yes
certainly
before
her
second
marriage
so
much
i
will
admit
but
leo
sellenthin
and
ulrich
have
been
friends
from
childhood
and
what
friends
something
quite
extraordinary
like
david
and
jonathan
would
ulrich
have
married
this
woman
if
there
had
been
anything
between
her
and
his
friend
it
stands
to
reason
that
there
could
have
been
nothing
does
it
frau
von
stolt
relapsed
into
meditation
her
husband
argument
apparently
had
convinced
her
but
apart
from
that
altogether
she
began
again
after
a
pause
leo
is
abroad
and
not
coming
home
what
concerns
us
now
is
felicitas
kletzingk
present
conduct
and
i
must
say
that
it
almost
amounts
to
a
scandal
herr
von
stolt
shrugged
his
shoulders
here
is
an
example
continued
his
wife
just
one
example
the
other
morning
i
had
occasion
to
turn
out
our
sons
pockets
so
you
are
in
the
habit
of
turning
out
other
people
pockets
exclaimed
herr
stolt
perceptibly
disturbed
by
the
discovery
yes
why
not
it
is
advisable
to
keep
one
self
abreast
of
their
little
peccadilloes
in
love
as
well
as
professional
affairs
and
what
do
you
think
i
found
letters
from
madam
felicitas
small
missives
reeking
with
that
abominable
perfume
with
which
she
always
scents
herself
herr
von
stolt
involuntarily
sniffed
the
air
and
smiled
dreamily
as
he
did
so
it
was
my
privilege
to
read
through
a
real
what
do
you
call
it
æsthetic
correspondence
as
exaggerated
as
you
please
all
about
noble
humanity
moonshine
communion
with
nature
and
other
rubbish
not
that
there
is
any
question
of
our
good
sons
being
capable
of
living
up
to
such
a
silly
for
though
they
have
an
excellent
knowledge
of
horses
this
sort
of
is
quite
beyond
their
comprehension
thank
god
besides
i
talked
to
them
each
separately
and
put
my
emphatic
veto
upon
it
and
has
that
done
any
good
asked
herr
von
stolt
with
a
grin
to
a
certain
extent
it
has
but
of
course
i
could
not
prevent
their
actual
visits
to
felicitas
i
do
understand
how
ulrich
can
wink
at
his
wife
intercourse
with
these
young
men
not
only
our
two
but
otzen
and
neuhaus
and
the
second
sembritzky
and
a
lot
more
of
them
are
constantly
there
all
young
and
green
hum
there
are
older
visitors
too
i
thinking
interposed
herr
von
stolt
thoughtfully
yes
there
is
yourself
for
instance
really
malwine
he
ejaculated
reproachfully
dear
alfred
we
understand
each
other
when
i
do
happen
to
ride
over
to
uhlenfelde
it
is
to
see
ulrich
especially
when
ulrich
is
in
the
reichstag
the
matrimonial
recriminations
ended
abruptly
for
at
this
moment
a
tall
spare
masculine
figure
in
a
white
which
hung
without
a
fold
glided
past
the
window
it
rather
resembled
a
walking
towel
on
which
some
one
had
stuck
a
head
talk
of
the
devil
exclaimed
frau
malwine
and
jumped
up
to
see
whither
the
passing
form
had
betaken
itself
who
was
it
asked
herr
von
stolt
who
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
window
ulrich
von
kletzingk
the
door
of
the
vestibule
opened
and
he
who
had
gone
by
came
in
he
had
a
pale
sickly
face
of
a
reflective
cast
with
sharp
small
nose
and
hollow
cheeks
set
on
narrow
shoulders
and
a
long
freckled
neck
it
was
framed
in
a
light
beard
which
hung
about
it
like
a
ragged
fringe
the
high
rather
receding
forehead
was
furrowed
with
three
perpendicular
lines
denoting
mental
fatigue
and
it
ended
in
a
shock
of
bristly
hair
standing
erect
the
most
remarkable
feature
of
this
intellectual
head
were
the
dark
brilliant
eyes
which
shone
forth
from
their
blue
sockets
like
torches
of
energy
after
emitting
luminous
flashes
they
seemed
to
slumber
wearily
again
till
a
new
excitement
set
them
aflame
once
more
when
he
was
aware
who
occupied
the
room
a
shadow
of
nervous
uneasiness
descended
for
a
moment
on
the
face
but
passed
quickly
away
the
tone
in
which
he
greeted
the
husband
and
wife
was
moderately
friendly
if
not
cold
his
voice
was
not
pleasant
to
hear
it
was
shrill
and
high
pitched
and
however
rapidly
he
spoke
the
words
seemed
to
be
forced
with
pain
and
difficulty
from
his
narrow
chest
frau
malwine
beamed
she
was
no
longer
the
mother
of
the
gracchi
in
which
part
she
had
been
just
posing
to
her
husband
she
exhausted
herself
in
expressions
of
affection
for
frau
felicitas
and
added
the
tender
reproach
that
it
was
ages
since
she
had
seen
anything
of
her
twice
when
she
had
been
expected
an
extra
supply
of
meringues
had
been
baked
of
the
kind
which
was
the
pride
of
her
modest
ménage
but
frau
felicitas
had
not
come
ulrich
kletzingk
allowed
this
outpouring
of
gush
to
pass
over
him
quietly
only
the
nervous
playing
with
the
buttons
of
his
betrayed
that
he
was
not
quite
at
ease
you
put
us
to
shame
madame
he
answered
your
friendship
however
has
been
too
unobtrusive
for
i
think
that
it
is
some
months
since
we
saw
you
at
uhlenfelde
frau
malwine
a
little
disconcerted
at
the
reminder
that
she
owed
uhlenfelde
a
call
nevertheless
in
the
same
strain
of
affected
went
so
far
as
to
explain
that
she
was
sure
she
had
been
well
represented
by
her
sons
kletzingk
bowed
and
smiled
politely
at
any
rate
she
continued
with
animation
i
ought
to
express
my
thanks
to
you
herr
baron
for
the
happy
influence
the
atmosphere
of
your
house
has
exercised
on
my
young
scapegraces
my
only
fear
is
that
i
may
have
abused
your
hospitality
in
sending
them
over
to
you
nearly
every
day
i
trust
that
they
have
always
given
my
kind
regards
i
believe
so
probably
he
gazed
out
of
the
window
at
that
moment
he
longed
for
nothing
more
earnestly
than
to
be
delivered
from
this
woman
offensive
chatter
herr
von
stolt
who
hitherto
had
been
content
to
smile
in
his
sleeve
in
cynical
enjoyment
of
his
wife
sallies
now
joined
in
the
conversation
he
inquired
after
the
condition
of
the
crops
at
uhlenfelde
and
gave
a
good
report
of
his
own
the
harvest
had
been
got
in
satisfactorily
on
the
whole
only
the
wheat
was
middling
he
left
the
rest
to
providence
but
do
tell
me
kletzingk
he
said
suddenly
taking
another
tack
what
is
up
at
halewitz
the
rye
there
is
yellow
as
guineas
and
still
uncut
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
as
we
drove
by
there
baron
kletzingk
bit
his
lips
bent
his
head
and
stared
silently
at
the
ground
i
do
mean
to
reproach
you
for
it
of
course
stolt
added
hastily
we
all
know
that
you
are
not
responsible
for
this
estate
falling
into
a
neglected
hell
pardon
the
expression
malwine
but
our
friend
has
been
for
four
years
in
my
opinion
it
is
time
that
he
came
home
i
am
expecting
him
now
replied
kletzingk
the
effect
of
this
announcement
was
stupendous
herr
von
stolt
nearly
choked
in
suppressing
a
cry
of
amazement
and
his
wife
bounded
up
as
if
she
had
been
shot
from
a
cannon
leo
sellenthin
it
is
impossible
coming
now
by
this
train
yes
by
this
train
where
is
he
coming
from
that
i
do
know
dear
madame
my
last
letter
to
him
was
addressed
to
la
plata
and
you
tell
me
all
this
as
if
it
were
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
are
you
pleased
how
could
i
be
otherwise
than
delighted
kletzingk
responded
with
him
i
lost
half
myself
ah
to
be
sure
and
do
tell
me
leo
and
you
the
old
intimacy
exists
still
still
madame
and
i
hope
and
trust
that
it
will
continue
to
exist
in
defiance
of
anything
the
world
may
choose
to
say
his
eyes
rested
steadily
on
her
face
while
she
turned
to
study
a
with
interest
the
two
young
cuirassier
officers
rushed
in
to
announce
that
the
train
was
in
sight
when
they
saw
the
baron
they
appeared
suddenly
abashed
they
waited
awkwardly
till
he
offered
them
his
hand
and
then
seized
it
with
somewhat
excessive
warmth
but
kletzingk
was
far
from
paying
heed
to
their
manners
it
was
with
an
effort
that
he
roused
himself
sufficiently
to
bid
the
old
lady
and
gentleman
a
courteous
farewell
i
hope
sellenthin
will
speak
to
us
called
frau
von
stolt
after
him
he
did
not
hear
with
his
long
steps
he
hurried
on
to
the
platform
his
breast
heaved
and
the
veins
started
out
in
knots
on
his
wide
arched
temples
he
stood
there
with
his
clenched
fist
pressed
to
his
left
side
and
stared
with
frightened
eyes
at
the
incoming
train
uli
cried
a
resonant
voice
in
jubilation
echoing
along
the
platform
and
a
blond
head
was
thrust
out
of
one
of
the
carriage
windows
beneath
the
yellow
hair
were
cheeks
tanned
to
copper
hue
a
pair
of
merrily
twinkling
eyes
and
a
long
flowing
beard
which
the
draught
from
the
train
swept
backwards
like
a
besom
frau
von
stolt
caught
hold
of
her
husband
arm
he
has
not
improved
in
looks
said
she
grown
rather
wild
he
assented
four
were
directed
with
breathless
attention
to
the
two
friends
as
they
flew
into
each
other
embrace
it
was
wise
of
him
after
all
to
wait
till
the
grass
had
grown
over
that
affair
went
on
frau
malwine
but
herr
von
stolt
as
sceptical
reserved
his
opinion
he
let
his
fall
made
a
grimace
and
merely
muttered
unsavoury
story
unsavoury
story
then
apparently
radiant
with
joy
he
hurried
forward
to
shake
the
hand
of
the
neighbour
ii
cool
twilight
reigned
in
the
back
parlour
of
the
prussian
crown
the
outside
shutters
were
closed
and
only
one
small
chink
let
in
the
now
lessened
heat
of
the
sun
shining
through
the
green
boughs
of
the
limes
without
and
streaming
across
the
floor
in
a
bar
of
subdued
gold
in
this
room
for
generations
any
one
who
was
anybody
in
münsterberg
society
or
who
through
professional
service
had
any
claim
on
it
at
all
had
been
in
the
habit
of
meeting
besides
wealthy
landowners
and
the
officers
of
the
münsterberg
cavalry
the
justice
of
the
peace
a
couple
of
doctors
and
two
or
three
magistrates
assembled
there
nearly
every
evening
for
convivial
intercourse
it
also
served
as
a
convenient
rendezvous
for
the
wives
of
the
country
gentry
when
they
came
into
the
town
for
shopping
and
in
the
holidays
it
was
the
place
chosen
by
their
sons
wherein
to
celebrate
their
kneips
on
these
occasions
the
door
was
kept
locked
and
adorned
with
a
placard
bearing
the
words
closed
for
cleaning
a
precautionary
measure
to
ensure
the
rising
generation
against
parental
intrusion
it
was
here
on
familiar
ground
in
the
room
which
had
once
witnessed
the
feats
in
of
quartaner
sellenthin
that
the
reunited
friends
came
to
rest
and
refresh
themselves
while
ulrich
kletzingk
white
and
exhausted
from
heat
reclined
in
the
corner
of
a
sofa
his
long
legs
outstretched
the
returned
traveller
wildly
happy
paced
up
and
down
between
the
tables
breathing
in
greedily
the
old
scent
that
he
knew
so
well
of
mingled
tobacco
leather
and
beer
at
first
a
thoughtless
almost
animal
gladness
in
being
together
again
deprived
them
of
speech
their
hearts
were
so
full
of
each
other
that
they
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
say
then
at
last
ulrich
opened
the
conversation
with
a
casual
question
did
you
come
by
hamburg
leo
came
and
planted
his
six
feet
of
massive
height
in
front
of
his
friend
yes
the
day
before
yesterday
i
set
foot
on
german
soil
and
went
straightway
to
a
restaurant
to
breakfast
i
had
a
couple
of
congenial
souls
from
buenos
ayres
with
me
they
and
i
went
on
breakfasting
the
whole
day
and
night
through
till
it
was
time
for
breakfast
again
the
next
morning
at
this
he
laughed
showing
the
whole
of
his
magnificent
set
of
teeth
and
rolled
his
tongue
with
a
clicking
sound
over
his
gums
he
stood
there
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
in
the
flower
of
his
manly
strength
his
thick
beard
waved
back
in
two
semicircles
over
his
firm
rounded
cheeks
which
like
the
short
nose
might
have
been
moulded
in
bronze
and
then
it
mingled
with
the
curly
moustache
in
a
riot
of
waving
strands
shading
from
light
to
dark
the
hair
at
the
back
of
his
head
was
cropped
to
the
roots
and
displayed
the
shape
of
the
powerful
skull
which
was
posed
on
the
ruddy
full
neck
like
the
copula
of
a
dome
and
that
reminds
me
he
continued
that
i
have
had
nothing
to
eat
since
i
left
hamburg
what
does
it
mean
it
is
the
way
prodigal
sons
are
generally
treated
shall
i
still
have
to
go
hunting
for
my
meat
in
the
saddle
now
i
am
in
europe
and
then
he
roared
through
the
hollow
of
his
hand
landlord
waiter
scullion
till
the
walls
shook
from
the
echoes
of
his
voice
the
landlord
greasy
and
smiling
with
two
prussian
ringlets
over
his
ears
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
expressed
himself
respectfully
overjoyed
to
find
that
the
herr
baron
had
not
lost
his
healthy
voice
in
foreign
countries
that
was
a
sign
the
rest
was
in
good
condition
in
such
good
condition
my
friend
replied
leo
that
if
you
venture
again
to
criticise
my
voice
you
will
find
yourself
being
chucked
out
of
one
of
your
own
windows
the
landlord
in
alarm
begged
pardon
and
promising
to
send
up
the
best
contents
of
his
larder
retired
with
a
servile
bow
to
tell
you
the
truth
old
fellow
leo
said
turning
to
his
friend
i
do
like
your
looks
you
lay
there
like
one
crucified
ulrich
kletzingk
clenched
his
teeth
and
raised
himself
into
an
erect
position
thank
you
he
said
i
am
quite
revived
now
what
about
the
heart
how
are
the
attacks
now
who
i
should
like
to
know
has
been
rubbing
your
head
for
you
all
this
time
when
the
little
white
mice
swarm
ulrich
smiled
as
we
smile
at
children
talk
which
does
our
heart
good
to
hear
how
long
it
seems
since
i
heard
your
old
expressions
he
said
affectionate
tenderness
bringing
a
mist
before
his
dear
eyes
now
all
i
want
is
to
hear
you
call
me
girl
and
then
i
shall
feel
old
times
have
really
come
back
again
i
will
call
you
so
if
you
like
leo
replied
but
kindly
answer
my
question
yes
at
first
my
attacks
of
heart
exhaustion
were
much
less
frequent
and
then
when
they
were
bad
you
know
there
was
my
my
wife
although
he
stopped
short
leo
sellenthin
looked
at
the
floor
and
frowned
his
full
sensuous
lips
closed
tightly
he
nodded
two
or
three
times
and
muttered
yes
of
course
your
wife
your
wife
the
landlord
brought
in
the
wine
they
drank
to
each
other
and
clinked
glasses
and
at
the
sound
their
eyes
met
ulrich
stretched
his
lean
freckled
hand
across
the
table
to
his
friend
in
silence
and
leo
grasped
it
with
hearty
fervour
we
drink
to
each
other
old
boy
he
exclaimed
ulrich
looked
as
if
he
wished
to
add
something
but
suppressed
it
and
then
repeated
to
each
other
and
that
all
may
be
the
same
as
ever
between
us
and
that
all
may
be
the
same
as
ever
leo
threw
his
glass
behind
him
against
the
wall
and
it
smashed
ulrich
did
the
same
then
when
fresh
glasses
were
brought
leo
in
two
draughts
emptied
the
bottle
you
merely
sip
he
said
half
apologetically
but
in
his
case
it
would
seem
that
it
was
not
thirst
alone
which
drove
him
to
drink
he
jumped
up
restlessly
sat
down
and
jumped
up
again
to
pace
the
room
with
energetic
strides
he
acted
like
one
who
gathers
himself
together
courageously
to
meet
an
emergency
ulrich
eyes
followed
him
and
a
smile
of
comprehension
dawned
on
his
face
leo
he
began
giving
his
embarrassed
friend
a
lead
did
you
ever
congratulate
me
on
my
marriage
in
your
letters
i
remember
whether
you
did
or
not
no
i
did
leo
answered
gruffly
was
that
polite
no
but
there
is
no
necessity
for
me
to
be
polite
to
you
do
you
approve
of
my
marriage
approve
good
god
do
you
see
that
nothing
is
to
be
gained
by
asking
me
two
years
after
the
marriage
has
taken
place
whether
i
approve
of
it
my
approval
or
disapproval
does
matter
but
what
does
matter
he
came
nearer
and
laid
both
hands
on
his
friend
shoulder
staring
into
his
eyes
anxiously
and
searchingly
uli
are
you
happy
ulrich
laughed
it
was
a
laugh
of
great
irony
at
his
own
expense
that
escaped
the
narrow
chest
from
which
he
breathed
with
such
difficulty
and
a
less
sharp
ear
than
leo
would
not
have
detected
in
it
an
undertone
of
weariness
or
hesitation
why
this
sudden
seriousness
he
asked
you
know
that
so
long
as
i
sit
on
the
liberal
bench
thresh
my
own
straw
and
can
prove
that
man
was
first
created
a
baron
my
happiness
is
assured
you
are
evading
my
question
leo
responded
that
being
so
i
will
forthwith
devote
myself
exclusively
to
this
young
chicken
but
not
to
the
cucumber
which
accompanies
it
so
saying
he
began
to
eat
apparently
with
a
ravenous
appetite
ulrich
watched
him
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
then
he
said
you
are
right
after
all
it
is
not
worth
while
to
try
and
pass
off
as
a
joke
what
is
of
vital
gravity
that
is
an
outrage
on
one
inner
self
you
ask
me
if
i
am
happy
look
at
me
and
say
if
it
is
possible
for
me
to
be
happy
you
know
that
i
have
always
been
ænemic
and
weakly
only
by
the
most
vigilant
and
rigorous
training
of
my
have
i
been
able
to
develop
myself
into
an
even
partially
useful
human
being
and
by
the
expenditure
of
energy
in
contending
with
pitiful
hindrances
which
another
a
healthy
man
knows
nothing
about
or
if
he
does
thinks
nothing
of
i
have
had
to
sacrifice
so
much
sense
of
personal
enjoyment
at
the
same
time
that
any
real
happiness
where
i
am
concerned
is
not
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
yet
i
ventured
to
offer
my
hand
to
felicitas
i
an
invalid
a
student
and
a
hermit
with
nothing
to
recommend
me
except
my
estate
and
my
honourable
intentions
to
felicitas
a
creature
so
soft
and
made
for
pleasure
so
irresistibly
open
to
every
impression
of
the
imagination
and
every
sensuous
charm
who
repays
the
world
in
such
full
measure
for
what
she
receives
from
it
surely
it
were
a
crime
if
i
tried
to
interest
her
in
my
quiet
abstract
speculations
in
allowing
her
every
imaginable
freedom
i
purchase
the
right
to
live
near
her
as
her
husband
she
is
fond
of
men
society
very
well
i
acquiesce
calmly
in
all
the
youth
of
the
neighbourhood
flocking
to
pay
her
court
and
to
hear
her
confess
to
me
in
her
sweet
shamefaced
way
what
fools
men
make
of
themselves
for
her
sake
affords
me
a
sort
of
secret
satisfaction
i
give
her
whims
whether
she
builds
artistic
ruins
in
the
park
or
gallops
over
the
meadows
by
night
or
swims
in
the
river
in
the
moonlight
or
when
the
sun
is
shining
shuts
the
shutters
and
lies
in
bed
by
lamplight
till
evening
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
she
may
do
exactly
as
she
likes
and
the
breath
of
gossip
dare
not
touch
her
for
she
is
my
wife
i
regard
her
as
some
beautiful
exotic
which
has
been
committed
to
my
care
the
strange
loveliness
of
which
must
be
worshipped
unconditionally
even
if
its
nature
and
the
laws
of
its
growth
are
not
understood
but
how
absurd
to
chatter
on
about
her
thus
you
know
her
yes
i
know
her
leo
made
answer
grimly
something
in
his
tone
excited
ulrich
suspicion
do
you
mean
to
imply
that
you
do
agree
with
me
i
i
imply
nothing
please
i
would
much
rather
you
spoke
out
well
then
if
i
must
speak
out
i
would
say
that
in
spite
of
all
the
hard
discipline
with
which
you
have
schooled
yourself
you
remain
as
rank
and
romantic
a
sentimentalist
as
ever
for
proof
that
you
always
were
one
take
the
isle
of
friendship
ah
does
it
still
exist
our
isle
of
friendship
the
stream
has
not
swept
it
away
it
stands
firm
and
steadfast
like
us
two
ulrich
said
with
a
seraphic
smile
ah
that
is
capital
steadfast
as
we
are
but
now
if
you
please
just
recall
how
you
asked
of
your
old
godfather
as
a
present
for
your
confirmation
to
be
allowed
to
build
a
pagan
temple
on
the
island
with
we
two
as
castor
and
pollux
inside
and
think
of
all
the
mock
sacrifices
and
solemn
ceremonies
and
mummery
childish
follies
reminiscences
of
my
homeric
readings
ulrich
interposed
yes
but
why
did
these
sort
of
ideas
never
occur
to
me
simply
because
i
am
a
plain
country
squire
whose
imagination
has
never
of
necessity
been
stretched
to
conceive
of
anything
beyond
a
fiery
horse
women
and
wine
but
you
well
the
temple
speaks
volumes
you
have
a
knack
of
converting
those
you
care
for
into
ideal
beings
who
exist
absolutely
only
in
your
fancy
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
overrate
felicitas
when
will
you
have
done
with
your
inquisitorial
you
mean
to
say
remember
that
i
am
not
a
poacher
but
to
return
to
felicitas
you
know
that
i
knew
her
when
she
was
in
pinafores
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that
she
was
often
at
halewitz
being
a
distant
cousin
to
me
at
one
time
once
i
was
devilish
fond
of
her
but
i
never
regarded
her
in
the
light
of
what
you
call
a
rare
exotic
bloom
either
i
had
a
sufficiently
discerning
eye
or
blockhead
that
i
am
i
know
women
better
than
you
with
your
sevenfold
wisdom
ulrich
fixed
his
eyes
steadily
on
the
floor
leo
after
he
had
looked
at
him
with
a
shyly
inquiring
glance
took
heart
and
blurted
out
man
tell
me
this
why
on
earth
were
you
so
mad
as
to
make
her
your
wife
ulrich
shrank
and
cowered
under
the
direct
blow
i
fail
to
understand
you
leo
he
said
on
the
defensive
and
leo
saw
with
some
alarm
that
he
had
gone
too
far
i
mean
after
what
had
happened
he
explained
scarcely
audibly
and
what
had
happened
because
her
husband
fell
by
your
hand
in
honourable
combat
was
i
to
be
prevented
from
winning
her
true
friends
that
we
are
we
are
not
quite
identical
if
i
had
not
always
felt
sure
that
i
had
acted
according
to
your
principles
i
might
almost
say
in
your
interest
leo
laughed
loud
good
heavens
in
mine
he
exclaimed
interrupting
him
yes
certainly
and
i
will
tell
you
why
you
remember
that
memorable
evening
when
you
came
tearing
to
my
place
and
said
to
me
has
sought
a
dispute
with
me
at
cards
and
i
have
been
obliged
to
challenge
him
you
must
be
my
second
of
course
now
do
you
also
recollect
what
i
asked
you
at
the
same
time
leo
gazed
at
him
blankly
i
remember
he
murmured
i
said
wrangle
might
easily
be
only
a
blind
the
country
rings
with
all
sorts
of
scandal
you
know
that
i
would
not
lend
myself
to
perpetrate
a
wrong
and
so
i
ask
you
solemnly
as
our
friendship
is
sacred
does
any
tie
exist
between
you
and
felicitas
forbidden
by
laws
human
and
divine
you
answered
and
i
was
satisfied
because
the
idea
of
either
of
us
lying
to
each
other
would
be
too
absurd
is
it
not
so
yes
it
would
have
been
absurd
repeated
leo
and
pressed
his
lips
together
there
was
nothing
wonderful
in
the
fact
that
one
of
the
duellists
should
fall
at
the
hands
of
the
other
no
matter
how
paltry
the
cause
of
quarrel
we
all
knew
rhaden
vindictive
nature
i
do
deny
that
you
wished
to
spare
him
but
you
got
heated
and
as
luck
would
have
it
your
third
bullet
took
a
fatal
direction
the
thing
happened
and
we
had
to
take
the
consequences
it
was
quite
right
of
you
to
go
away
for
a
time
out
of
reach
of
the
women
cackle
and
whether
you
were
equally
wise
after
your
period
of
detention
in
a
fortress
was
over
to
go
so
far
abroad
and
let
nothing
be
heard
of
you
for
six
months
is
to
my
mind
doubtful
for
it
simply
opened
one
door
of
conjecture
after
the
other
to
the
gossips
and
slanderers
he
stopped
and
damped
his
projecting
lips
on
the
edge
of
his
his
cheeks
burned
and
the
thin
transparent
face
seemed
illumined
by
an
inward
fire
but
he
continued
in
the
same
strain
of
merciless
calm
you
will
probably
not
have
forgotten
anything
that
passed
at
our
last
meeting
you
had
just
received
sentence
two
years
a
round
sum
as
you
expressed
it
half
of
which
thank
god
you
were
let
off
you
wanted
to
give
yourself
up
that
same
evening
we
were
sitting
over
our
wine
celebrating
a
separation
as
we
celebrate
our
reunion
that
is
four
and
a
half
years
ago
and
meanwhile
many
things
have
changed
you
handed
over
to
me
the
necessary
papers
and
made
me
the
trustee
of
your
property
unfortunately
without
strictly
stipulating
that
i
should
have
complete
authority
in
your
absence
but
more
of
that
hereafter
next
you
said
distinctly
have
yet
another
favour
to
ask
of
you
you
know
that
through
me
felicitas
is
placed
in
an
unpleasant
position
naturally
it
would
not
be
possible
for
me
to
venture
in
her
neighbourhood
even
if
i
were
to
be
soon
set
at
liberty
and
as
the
question
what
will
become
of
her
is
much
on
my
mind
i
beg
you
with
all
my
heart
to
protect
her
stand
by
her
and
see
that
no
breath
of
the
hateful
calumny
crosses
her
threshold
is
that
correct
correct
yes
yes
leo
said
irritably
and
stabbed
at
the
remains
of
the
fowl
which
lay
in
cold
congealed
gravy
and
what
did
i
ask
you
then
do
know
it
does
matter
it
really
does
matter
only
make
haste
and
have
done
i
asked
you
ulrich
went
on
unperturbed
you
bear
any
old
love
towards
her
in
your
heart
and
you
replied
did
but
it
is
all
past
now
and
i
asked
you
further
is
she
free
and
you
said
far
as
i
am
concerned
she
is
but
man
how
could
i
suspect
that
you
yourself
does
that
alter
the
case
was
she
less
free
on
that
account
get
out
with
your
judicial
you
have
spoilt
my
appetite
said
leo
laying
down
his
fork
forgive
me
dear
old
boy
ulrich
responded
but
i
ca
spare
you
this
explanation
lest
you
should
end
by
reproaching
me
with
having
thrown
dust
in
your
eyes
and
having
made
a
breach
between
us
by
my
marriage
it
seems
to
me
that
is
what
it
will
amount
to
as
it
is
leo
growled
looking
gloomily
before
him
what
you
say
that
ulrich
stammered
as
if
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
ears
perhaps
you
will
give
me
your
views
as
to
how
our
relations
are
to
continue
my
view
is
that
if
at
heart
all
is
the
same
as
of
old
the
ways
and
means
of
continuing
our
intercourse
need
concern
us
least
that
is
excellent
quite
excellent
and
only
what
one
would
expect
from
a
man
of
ideal
sentiment
but
it
is
just
as
it
always
was
your
knowledge
of
life
deserts
you
wherever
love
and
friendship
and
fine
feeling
come
in
a
woman
old
fellow
stands
between
us
now
and
do
you
imagine
for
a
moment
that
this
woman
could
bring
herself
to
forget
what
has
happened
sufficiently
to
tolerate
calmly
my
coming
and
going
at
uhlenfelde
and
even
if
she
were
willing
how
could
i
consent
to
it
remember
there
a
boy
running
about
your
house
you
are
fond
of
him
eh
a
melancholy
gleam
of
acquired
parental
pride
fluttered
over
face
i
am
very
fond
of
him
he
said
softly
when
i
knew
him
he
was
quite
a
little
chap
four
years
old
at
most
he
often
sat
on
my
knee
he
was
lovable
that
much
i
know
about
him
but
what
is
the
good
of
recalling
it
the
boy
has
the
features
of
the
man
whom
i
once
saw
through
the
smoke
of
my
pistol
fall
to
the
ground
with
a
bullet
in
his
side
is
that
enough
ulrich
breathed
heavily
and
stared
at
him
and
now
i
tell
you
once
for
all
leo
continued
raising
his
voice
that
if
you
had
asked
the
advice
which
would
only
have
been
fitting
before
taking
so
grave
a
step
of
your
stupid
old
comrade
leo
sellenthin
at
the
time
you
resolved
to
plunge
into
this
marriage
prompted
either
by
mad
generosity
or
an
equally
mad
passion
he
would
have
answered
you
clear
and
straight
as
is
his
way
between
her
and
me
there
ulrich
grew
a
shade
paler
and
his
left
hand
clasped
the
convulsively
he
rose
slowly
saying
in
a
voice
which
anxiety
at
the
thought
of
his
friend
breaking
with
him
completely
altered
leo
you
know
that
i
cling
to
you
as
to
a
part
of
my
own
body
but
i
will
know
the
truth
are
you
trying
to
bring
about
a
rupture
if
so
say
so
a
peal
of
laughter
came
from
leo
ah
now
i
have
caught
it
as
usual
he
cried
all
our
life
long
we
have
had
these
scenes
when
we
were
boys
well
you
know
what
it
used
to
be
once
when
i
tore
myself
from
you
because
i
got
bored
with
philosophising
in
your
company
about
the
good
of
humanity
and
preferred
to
lie
under
the
garden
hedge
with
rupp
and
sydow
to
bombard
the
pretty
girls
as
they
went
by
with
paper
pellets
then
i
got
a
note
are
insincere
a
traitor
i
will
do
away
with
myself
ay
the
devil
take
your
confounded
heroics
he
stood
up
and
soothed
his
friend
who
sank
back
again
on
the
and
caressed
comically
his
bristly
hair
there
there
little
girlie
he
laughed
so
long
as
you
live
you
wo
get
rid
of
me
good
for
nothing
that
i
am
who
would
nurse
you
and
stroke
your
head
when
the
white
mice
bother
you
and
who
would
preach
morality
to
me
and
cram
wisdom
into
me
when
i
got
into
scrapes
if
he
stopped
suddenly
and
cast
a
glance
at
the
keyhole
then
seized
an
empty
bottle
and
hurled
it
with
a
kind
of
at
the
hinges
of
the
door
so
that
it
smashed
to
pieces
in
contact
with
the
iron
ulrich
sprang
up
in
horror
what
has
happened
he
asked
nothing
much
leo
explained
perfectly
calm
again
only
a
worm
of
a
head
waiter
was
sneaking
around
probably
to
listen
to
us
so
i
tried
to
give
him
his
ulrich
looked
at
him
in
bewilderment
you
think
i
have
roughened
somewhat
out
there
amongst
savages
eh
leo
asked
with
a
laugh
but
never
mind
i
have
come
back
to
you
sound
and
whole
a
fellow
who
has
sifted
and
proved
himself
so
that
at
this
moment
he
doubts
whether
in
the
whole
of
god
earthly
garden
there
grows
a
finer
specimen
than
his
lowly
self
sometimes
when
i
have
had
to
go
six
months
without
anything
to
eat
i
have
been
able
to
subsist
on
my
as
the
bear
sucks
its
paws
and
grown
fatter
i
have
a
magnificent
maxim
which
is
nothing
and
if
at
one
time
i
was
a
wild
customer
and
have
my
conscience
loaded
to
the
utmost
capacity
nevertheless
i
have
been
able
to
enjoy
myself
and
must
be
content
only
woe
to
him
who
reminds
me
of
it
i
will
pay
him
out
by
bringing
home
to
him
all
the
vexation
and
resentment
it
has
cost
me
then
what
has
a
man
got
faults
for
if
he
may
be
revenged
for
them
on
some
one
else
a
comfortable
philosophy
laughed
ulrich
i
make
everything
comfortable
for
myself
leo
replied
stroking
his
blond
beard
back
over
his
shoulders
sins
as
well
as
reformation
now
when
i
have
awakened
to
full
consciousness
of
my
youthful
folly
and
see
that
i
have
squandered
the
best
years
of
my
life
neglected
my
possessions
sinned
against
my
friends
do
interrupt
i
have
more
than
you
think
grieved
my
mother
heart
and
made
her
suffer
for
my
wickedness
if
i
burst
forth
in
lamentation
or
tormented
myself
with
or
sank
into
a
slough
of
despair
would
it
do
anybody
any
good
nobody
what
should
i
undo
that
has
happened
in
the
past
nothing
on
the
contrary
i
should
but
complicate
matters
and
now
shall
i
tell
you
how
i
happen
to
have
come
home
your
last
letter
was
forwarded
from
buenos
ayres
to
the
steppes
where
i
had
been
camping
for
a
few
months
i
had
come
in
from
a
sweating
and
tired
as
a
dog
when
it
was
put
into
my
hand
you
wrote
of
my
property
being
in
a
bad
way
of
the
master
eye
being
needed
in
all
directions
that
you
could
not
stave
off
ruin
much
longer
and
a
good
deal
more
i
knew
well
enough
that
it
must
be
on
the
decline
especially
once
i
played
away
such
monstrous
sums
in
that
cursed
den
of
thieves
monte
carlo
but
i
had
been
too
to
think
about
it
over
in
europe
was
a
world
full
of
cares
and
worries
but
here
was
freedom
and
sheer
living
for
the
joy
of
living
the
whole
fabric
crumble
said
i
to
myself
out
of
the
way
of
the
and
stay
here
why
should
i
mother
and
sisters
were
provided
for
i
owed
no
one
anything
so
i
left
the
camp
and
wandered
forth
into
the
dusky
steppe
to
reflect
further
on
the
matter
i
felt
that
i
might
hit
on
the
right
solution
there
for
i
do
believe
there
could
be
a
spot
more
adapted
for
than
that
grassy
desert
with
the
wide
grey
sky
overhead
that
is
why
the
people
of
those
parts
too
are
so
cursedly
cute
and
murder
each
other
without
prejudice
well
the
long
and
short
of
it
was
that
when
i
was
striding
along
a
ploughed
path
between
wheatears
as
tall
as
a
man
my
foot
struck
against
something
it
was
the
carcass
of
a
horse
which
had
fallen
there
one
comes
across
such
a
sight
on
the
roads
every
fifty
yards
and
often
it
is
not
one
dead
horse
only
but
heaps
of
them
what
struck
me
about
this
one
was
that
they
had
taken
off
its
harness
it
was
still
warm
and
could
have
been
dead
scarcely
hours
apparently
it
had
belonged
to
the
caravan
of
our
expedition
and
i
resolved
to
give
our
guides
a
reminder
for
their
negligence
then
as
i
contemplated
this
poor
beast
that
looked
at
me
with
eyes
as
if
it
were
yet
alive
there
came
into
my
head
the
saying
of
a
man
who
endowed
our
squirearchy
with
new
life
new
strength
and
new
words
that
he
once
spoke
in
the
reichstag
good
horse
dies
in
harness
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
saw
before
me
you
with
your
miserable
skeleton
body
who
with
colossal
energy
have
had
to
wrestle
for
every
inch
of
what
you
have
become
you
whom
every
stripling
could
knock
down
but
whom
the
lowest
drunkards
among
your
tenants
worship
with
as
much
reverence
and
awe
as
their
god
you
who
were
born
to
be
anything
but
a
country
squire
and
yet
have
so
trained
yourself
to
it
that
you
have
converted
the
old
heritage
of
your
ancestors
into
a
modern
model
estate
you
who
sit
up
at
night
poring
over
scientific
books
and
never
weary
of
drinking
in
new
knowledge
you
who
have
given
our
constituency
a
name
in
the
reichstag
do
protest
i
know
even
out
there
people
sometimes
read
german
newspapers
yes
i
saw
you
before
me
labouring
on
without
pause
or
rest
till
the
weak
remnant
of
flesh
that
still
hung
on
your
bones
was
demanded
as
tribute
good
horse
dies
in
harness
i
repeated
over
and
over
again
to
myself
and
began
to
be
just
a
little
bit
ashamed
and
you
see
for
me
to
feel
ashamed
when
otherwise
i
was
so
well
satisfied
with
myself
meant
that
there
was
something
rotten
somewhere
so
said
i
to
myself
with
your
thick
skull
against
all
obstacles
and
be
a
damned
steady
fellow
and
to
begin
your
reformation
at
once
you
shall
start
for
home
at
dawn
of
day
and
that
same
night
as
a
proof
of
my
strong
moral
heroism
i
drank
the
whole
company
for
the
most
part
scum
under
the
table
at
least
i
would
have
done
so
if
there
had
been
a
table
when
they
were
all
lying
in
artistic
attitudes
on
the
grass
i
had
my
horse
saddled
and
with
my
two
servants
and
the
necessary
provisions
i
began
my
gallop
into
space
the
beasts
sniffed
in
the
morning
air
almost
as
if
they
scented
the
halewitz
stables
in
three
weeks
i
was
at
buenos
ayres
in
five
at
hamburg
eighteen
hours
later
at
the
prussian
crown
where
i
am
sitting
now
come
drink
another
the
glasses
clinked
and
ulrich
eyes
radiant
with
pride
hung
on
his
friend
do
your
people
know
of
your
arrival
he
asked
they
have
any
idea
of
it
unknown
i
shall
slink
into
my
house
and
lands
like
my
prototype
the
noble
old
ulysses
i
am
afraid
i
shall
not
find
the
outlook
very
brilliant
i
will
not
prejudice
you
beforehand
ulrich
said
we
shall
have
time
to
talk
business
when
you
have
seen
things
with
your
own
eyes
your
steward
kutowski
will
scarcely
be
able
to
succeed
in
hoodwinking
you
however
much
he
may
try
they
are
all
well
your
people
your
hair
is
whiter
but
she
is
quite
as
jolly
and
quite
as
pious
as
ever
and
your
sister
elly
has
grown
into
a
sweetly
pretty
girl
and
already
is
much
admired
your
sister
johanna
he
paused
and
the
lines
of
care
on
his
forehead
deepened
well
what
about
her
asked
leo
in
surprise
you
will
see
for
yourself
was
the
response
her
long
widowhood
does
not
seem
to
have
been
good
for
her
she
is
lonely
and
embittered
she
has
given
up
coming
to
uhlenfelde
and
is
on
bad
terms
with
my
wife
why
no
one
knows
she
also
seems
to
bear
a
grudge
against
me
nonsense
i
ca
believe
that
exclaimed
leo
she
always
swore
by
you
and
does
still
i
am
sure
apropos
ulrich
interposed
do
you
know
there
is
a
new
member
in
your
household
indeed
who
may
that
be
hertha
prachwitz
johanna
stepdaughter
leo
recollected
he
had
never
seen
her
but
his
mother
had
raved
about
her
in
nearly
every
letter
i
suppose
you
know
ulrich
said
smiling
that
she
is
heiress
to
the
podlinsky
estates
it
is
said
that
your
mother
jealously
guards
this
treasure
with
the
express
purpose
of
offering
her
to
you
immediately
on
your
return
leo
laughed
that
is
just
like
her
dear
old
lady
since
i
was
in
jackets
she
has
coupled
me
with
every
female
possessor
of
a
respectable
fortune
i
shall
have
no
objection
to
seeing
the
little
heiress
but
what
is
more
important
than
that
or
anything
else
uli
well
what
are
you
and
i
to
do
yes
what
are
you
and
i
to
do
the
friends
looked
at
each
other
in
blank
silence
iii
the
river
flowed
on
its
way
in
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
its
smooth
surface
was
still
steeped
in
purple
and
a
network
of
silver
ribbons
at
one
place
melting
into
each
other
at
another
clearly
defined
and
intermingled
with
fantastic
shapes
reeds
flowers
and
sedges
spread
itself
over
the
darkly
glowing
water
but
the
willows
which
kept
watch
like
sentinels
on
the
bank
in
vague
shadowy
rows
were
already
casting
broad
bands
of
darkness
across
the
edge
of
the
shining
mirror
and
these
were
slowly
encroaching
on
its
centre
the
distance
lay
veiled
in
a
blue
haze
here
and
there
a
damp
mist
mounted
from
the
meadows
and
clung
in
silvery
wisps
about
the
tops
of
solitary
clumps
of
poplars
which
rose
above
the
level
fields
and
stood
outlined
sharply
against
the
rosy
glow
of
the
evening
sky
silence
reigned
far
and
wide
from
time
to
time
a
dog
in
some
invisible
farmyard
bayed
sleepily
a
broody
now
and
then
gave
an
anxious
twitter
as
if
in
fear
of
an
enemy
and
high
aloft
the
subdued
cry
of
a
kingfisher
returning
late
from
the
chase
to
its
nest
sounded
through
the
air
there
was
life
on
the
water
a
raft
on
its
way
into
the
valley
revolved
lazily
in
the
circle
of
light
which
grew
gradually
smaller
and
being
now
cut
in
two
threatened
to
vanish
soon
altogether
in
darkness
like
a
great
snake
with
fiery
jaws
it
drifted
there
the
flames
beneath
the
blazed
and
vapour
ascended
to
paint
a
long
strip
of
cloud
on
the
evening
sky
where
here
and
there
a
star
shyly
opened
its
eye
a
vehicle
came
rattling
along
the
which
led
from
münsterberg
to
the
ferry
in
the
village
of
wengern
and
drew
up
at
the
ferry
station
which
was
deserted
and
dark
and
man
having
retired
to
rest
on
the
other
side
the
powerful
outline
of
leo
athletic
figure
filled
the
back
seat
he
was
leaning
back
indolently
whistling
snatches
of
a
nameless
song
and
sending
forth
clouds
of
smoke
from
a
short
clay
pipe
pulling
himself
erect
he
cried
out
in
a
voice
of
thunder
to
the
opposite
bank
ferryman
some
time
elapsed
before
he
was
answered
by
a
sign
of
life
the
light
of
a
lantern
moving
hither
and
thither
at
last
settled
its
course
and
from
the
end
of
the
raft
cast
a
long
gold
line
across
the
stream
the
driver
who
was
a
young
strapping
peasant
lad
belonging
to
the
stables
of
the
prussian
crown
turned
round
on
the
box
and
begging
the
gnädiger
herr
pardon
suggested
that
it
was
not
the
proper
big
but
only
a
skiff
which
was
coming
across
leo
gave
vent
to
his
ire
in
a
salvo
of
spanish
oaths
and
the
driver
thought
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
send
the
ferryman
back
so
that
i
may
kick
my
heels
here
for
another
leo
said
no
my
lad
i
would
rather
use
my
own
strong
legs
and
enter
my
ancestral
home
on
foot
have
a
home
my
lad
why
of
course
sir
the
driver
replied
my
father
sent
me
out
to
service
that
i
might
learn
something
of
the
ways
of
the
world
leo
chuckled
and
went
on
smoking
in
silence
every
word
of
the
broad
homely
dialect
that
fell
on
his
ear
every
fair
sunburnt
honest
countenance
that
met
his
eye
renewed
his
affection
for
his
birthplace
and
i
fool
did
want
to
come
back
he
murmured
to
himself
the
boat
landed
the
ferryman
was
still
old
jürgens
with
the
plaid
woollen
comforter
round
his
neck
and
the
same
great
patches
of
sailcloth
on
the
knees
of
his
trousers
he
began
to
grumble
and
scold
why
had
they
shouted
across
and
carriage
did
not
every
baby
in
arms
know
by
this
time
that
was
the
right
way
of
summoning
the
big
ferry
barge
instead
of
the
small
boat
you
are
quite
right
jürgens
said
leo
tapping
him
majestically
on
the
shoulder
it
is
a
grave
scandal
that
your
system
of
governing
the
stream
is
not
more
respected
at
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
the
old
man
shook
with
fright
then
he
snatched
off
his
cap
and
stammered
in
confusion
the
master
the
master
the
post
of
ferryman
at
wengern
was
in
the
gift
of
halewitz
and
it
had
been
given
twenty
years
ago
to
old
jürgens
for
even
then
he
had
been
old
in
reward
for
his
long
and
faithful
services
to
the
family
it
was
no
sinecure
but
where
does
such
a
thing
as
a
sinecure
exist
in
the
country
of
prussia
the
aged
retainer
struggled
to
keep
back
his
tears
he
seized
the
leonine
paw
that
rested
on
his
shoulder
and
seemed
as
if
he
would
never
stop
stroking
it
with
his
horny
gnarled
hands
leo
who
was
every
moment
feeling
more
at
home
in
his
patriarchal
inheritance
ordered
his
luggage
to
be
left
in
the
little
and
lavishly
overpaying
the
young
driver
dismissed
him
the
boat
put
off
and
glided
with
a
slight
grinding
on
the
pebbles
of
the
shallow
water
into
leo
content
absently
let
his
hand
dip
into
the
water
and
delighted
in
the
little
sparkling
rivulets
that
ran
up
his
arm
meanwhile
the
old
man
gazed
at
him
from
the
end
of
the
boat
with
big
eyes
it
would
be
best
he
said
at
last
to
row
the
herr
as
far
as
the
isle
of
friendship
which
is
halfway
there
leo
nodded
the
isle
of
friendship
so
well
known
was
the
tie
which
bound
him
and
ulrich
together
that
their
friendship
had
become
a
romance
current
amongst
the
people
so
that
even
the
name
they
had
given
in
joke
to
the
place
where
as
boys
they
had
loved
best
to
meet
which
they
had
never
mentioned
except
to
a
few
near
relations
had
grown
into
a
geographical
landmark
for
the
public
ah
but
if
they
knew
if
they
could
see
the
ghost
which
had
arisen
between
them
repent
nothing
a
voice
cried
out
within
him
and
he
struck
the
water
with
his
clenched
fist
till
a
fountain
of
glistening
drops
started
up
around
him
old
jürgens
nearly
dropped
his
oars
in
alarm
and
stuttered
out
a
query
leo
laughed
at
him
i
did
mean
anything
old
man
he
said
i
was
simply
quarrelling
with
brother
within
no
good
to
be
got
out
of
him
maybe
he
a
devil
said
the
old
ferryman
philosophically
and
rowed
on
the
boat
had
turned
its
keel
down
the
river
which
shimmered
faintly
as
it
wound
along
between
the
dusky
blackness
of
the
now
widening
almost
into
a
lake
then
narrowing
where
a
headland
like
an
outstretched
knee
jutted
darkly
into
the
ripples
the
deep
ruddy
glow
on
the
horizon
now
covered
a
smaller
space
a
phosphorescent
green
slashed
with
small
clouds
slowly
struggled
higher
and
higher
till
it
was
lost
in
the
dark
blue
of
night
the
twilight
of
midnight
the
dreamy
magic
of
which
is
only
known
to
men
who
have
their
homes
in
northern
climes
was
descending
on
the
earth
just
in
front
of
the
boat
floated
the
raft
a
huge
mass
reflected
in
the
shining
water
with
the
smoke
from
smouldering
brushwood
curling
softly
upwards
and
hovering
in
the
air
above
it
in
a
few
minutes
they
overtook
it
figures
crouching
on
the
rafters
raised
their
heads
in
languid
curiosity
and
stared
at
the
boat
as
it
passed
red
flames
flickered
still
under
the
cauldron
and
from
within
the
cabin
rough
as
any
in
the
fields
came
the
sound
of
a
woman
voice
singing
a
plaintive
ditty
in
about
half
an
hour
the
black
shadowy
outline
of
an
island
reared
itself
from
the
middle
of
the
gleaming
mirror
of
water
it
resembled
a
massive
for
from
the
stony
edge
of
its
banks
the
ragged
branches
of
the
alders
drooped
far
over
into
the
stream
this
was
it
at
the
sight
of
it
a
host
of
pictures
and
memories
surged
up
from
his
heart
secret
depths
where
they
had
till
now
lain
dormant
sent
to
sleep
over
and
over
again
by
the
one
grim
overshadowing
thought
that
had
brooded
on
his
mind
like
a
vulture
the
deadening
flap
of
whose
wings
had
drowned
for
years
all
home
voices
and
sentiment
within
him
leo
started
up
and
sought
with
eager
eyes
to
penetrate
the
thick
boscage
but
he
could
not
descry
a
gleam
of
the
white
temple
it
lay
buried
in
the
dusk
of
the
trees
but
there
on
the
right
bank
were
to
be
seen
buildings
black
and
ragged
in
outline
that
was
uhlenfelde
the
ancient
noble
house
where
lanky
uli
ruled
as
lord
and
master
and
beside
him
as
mistress
be
calm
do
think
about
it
he
cried
inwardly
the
boat
took
a
sharp
curve
towards
the
left
bank
where
amidst
tall
reeds
shone
forth
the
white
sand
of
a
a
few
minutes
later
leo
was
striding
alone
over
the
dewy
meadows
from
which
there
rose
a
sweet
scent
so
thick
and
heavy
one
could
almost
grasp
it
with
the
hand
at
his
feet
to
right
and
left
a
thousand
grasshoppers
kept
up
a
lively
chorus
the
little
creatures
startled
by
his
footsteps
hopped
on
like
heralds
before
him
and
in
the
branches
of
the
elms
which
studded
the
meadow
path
he
fancied
that
he
heard
from
time
to
time
a
rustling
whisper
of
welcome
a
wilderness
of
blossom
rioted
in
the
uncut
hedges
the
honeysuckle
bells
swept
his
hands
and
a
thick
rank
growth
of
bindweed
and
runnet
twined
about
his
feet
a
fine
moisture
sprinkled
his
brow
refreshingly
he
stood
still
and
looked
round
him
all
was
his
property
as
far
as
his
eye
could
reach
in
the
summer
twilight
he
was
overcome
by
a
sense
of
shame
this
soft
warm
nest
designed
by
a
kind
providence
as
it
seemed
for
his
especial
comfort
had
he
not
more
thoughtlessly
it
is
true
than
heartlessly
been
ready
to
sacrifice
it
to
the
first
stranger
who
came
along
a
lofty
consciousness
of
inherited
possessions
the
beauty
of
the
summer
night
and
the
nearness
of
home
combined
to
inspire
and
soften
him
he
pulled
off
his
cap
folded
his
hands
over
the
warm
bowl
of
his
pipe
and
prayed
with
tears
pouring
down
his
cheeks
it
was
a
man
ripe
and
strong
moderately
gifted
but
full
of
common
sense
knowing
well
what
he
had
learnt
from
life
what
he
might
do
and
might
not
who
came
thus
boldly
into
the
presence
of
his
maker
and
spoke
frankly
to
him
when
he
had
done
he
puffed
vigorously
at
his
cooling
pipe
and
in
a
serene
mood
walked
towards
the
ancestral
seat
of
the
sellenthins
which
greeted
him
out
of
the
shadows
iv
he
came
to
a
standstill
at
the
as
he
was
about
to
pull
the
bell
a
din
of
singing
voices
fell
on
his
ear
interrupted
by
guttural
laughter
and
applause
which
elicited
a
new
and
more
confused
outburst
of
song
the
noise
seemed
to
proceed
from
the
bailiff
house
which
was
the
dwelling
of
uncle
kutowski
as
well
as
of
the
two
bailiffs
presumably
the
stream
of
light
which
till
now
had
been
concealed
from
his
eyes
by
the
came
from
the
same
quarter
they
manage
to
have
a
rollicking
good
time
of
it
without
me
at
halewitz
evidently
he
said
to
himself
frowning
and
was
going
to
climb
over
the
wall
near
the
wicket
gate
when
he
remembered
in
time
the
broken
stuck
in
the
cement
of
the
bastions
for
the
reception
of
thieves
and
tramps
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
slink
round
in
the
shadow
of
the
park
wall
to
the
little
secret
garden
door
which
once
had
been
contrived
for
him
by
uncle
kutowski
so
that
his
excursions
by
night
should
not
come
to
his
father
ears
of
course
it
was
an
understood
thing
that
in
so
zealously
rendering
this
service
uncle
kutowski
also
acted
in
his
own
interest
for
he
too
had
had
good
reasons
for
keeping
his
nocturnal
adventures
private
and
unbeknown
to
the
master
of
the
house
leo
paced
slowly
along
the
dry
moat
which
skirted
the
park
and
over
which
the
limes
of
halewitz
cast
the
shade
of
their
dark
masses
of
foliage
till
he
came
to
the
spot
which
he
supposed
was
only
known
to
himself
and
to
his
uncle
but
to
his
vexation
and
amazement
he
saw
that
the
little
door
was
standing
wide
open
and
worse
still
the
wilderness
of
brambles
and
gooseberry
bushes
which
on
the
inner
side
had
almost
buried
the
approach
to
the
exit
had
been
uprooted
and
levelled
and
replaced
by
a
convenient
gravel
path
that
seemed
to
invite
alluringly
any
person
to
the
privy
door
thus
do
our
old
vices
punish
us
thought
leo
and
he
recalled
with
a
stab
at
his
heart
the
period
of
his
life
when
at
this
door
night
after
night
there
stood
ready
for
him
a
saddled
horse
which
uncle
kutowski
had
procured
for
him
and
which
towards
morning
would
be
driven
out
to
grass
sweating
and
covered
with
foam
wait
a
bit
you
scoundrels
he
muttered
betwixt
his
teeth
i
show
you
which
is
the
right
path
there
were
still
lights
illuminating
the
windows
of
the
castle
that
faced
the
a
broad
stone
terrace
ran
nearly
the
whole
length
of
the
rambling
building
and
old
vines
which
never
bore
fruit
draped
the
balustrade
in
the
middle
of
the
terrace
a
flight
of
dilapidated
steps
flanked
by
two
nymphs
in
sandstone
led
down
to
the
garden
the
glass
doors
of
the
garden
salon
were
open
and
the
hanging
lamp
with
its
three
sconces
lighted
the
table
from
which
supper
had
been
cleared
away
and
sent
a
warm
red
glow
across
the
terrace
as
far
as
the
venerable
heads
of
the
nymphs
whose
fragile
profiles
it
touched
with
gold
leo
walked
as
softly
as
the
crunching
gravel
and
his
own
vigorous
footsteps
would
allow
towards
the
light
he
avoided
the
wooden
kiosque
the
white
plaster
pillars
of
which
seen
from
the
opposite
side
gave
a
finish
to
the
perspective
of
the
landscape
and
rounding
the
from
whose
slimy
depths
rose
a
soft
gurgling
he
banged
his
head
against
the
obelisk
it
was
a
stupid
erection
of
brickwork
and
mortar
with
a
bronze
tablet
let
into
the
middle
recording
for
posterity
the
heroic
deeds
of
fritz
von
sellenthin
at
the
battle
of
hohenfriedberg
a
pity
the
storms
have
not
demolished
this
thought
leo
as
he
rubbed
the
lump
on
his
forehead
with
a
pained
smile
at
this
moment
there
appeared
framed
in
the
brightly
illuminated
doorway
two
girlish
figures
with
their
arms
round
each
other
they
moved
forward
with
a
lazy
rocking
motion
and
the
gold
rays
of
the
lamp
flashed
on
their
heads
and
outlined
the
shadows
cast
by
the
two
slender
young
forms
with
a
narrow
line
of
light
they
had
flung
on
attire
with
the
ingenuous
freedom
of
a
pair
of
young
virgins
who
feel
secure
in
there
being
no
man
in
the
house
and
presented
themselves
in
and
with
flowing
tresses
one
was
nearly
a
head
taller
than
the
other
and
a
reddish
gleam
shot
from
the
loosened
plaits
which
floated
over
her
head
and
shoulders
by
daylight
she
would
probably
be
a
brunette
the
shorter
girl
displayed
unmistakably
the
famous
sellenthin
gold
in
her
blond
locks
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
going
to
descend
into
the
garden
and
leo
quickly
took
refuge
in
the
shadow
of
the
terrace
wall
where
he
would
be
hidden
from
view
by
the
vine
espalier
but
they
stayed
up
above
after
all
seating
themselves
on
the
balustrade
and
swinging
their
feet
so
that
when
they
touched
the
ground
a
shower
of
dust
sand
and
little
stones
fell
on
his
head
the
two
girls
gazed
down
into
the
garden
and
looking
up
he
could
see
the
dainty
shining
oval
of
their
faces
bent
towards
him
he
felt
a
little
nervous
at
his
post
of
observation
it
was
innocent
schoolgirl
chatter
that
he
overheard
intermingled
with
kisses
and
giggles
in
one
of
the
voices
which
sounded
low
and
muffled
there
was
a
caressing
note
like
the
cooing
of
a
dove
the
other
was
a
rich
full
alto
which
seemed
to
well
forth
from
the
depths
of
the
chest
this
fulness
of
tone
was
accentuated
by
the
hard
slightly
reminiscent
of
the
stable
with
some
difficulty
he
recalled
his
little
sister
in
the
first
voice
and
concluded
that
the
other
belonged
to
johanna
the
rich
little
heiress
whom
his
mother
had
kept
bewitched
in
the
ancient
castle
for
his
especial
benefit
they
talked
of
clothes
girl
friends
and
books
of
getting
up
early
of
milking
and
and
finally
they
began
to
talk
about
himself
the
letter
from
buenos
ayres
which
must
have
arrived
that
morning
was
evidently
in
their
minds
johanna
revealed
to
her
little
companion
energetic
plans
which
convinced
him
that
mamma
had
already
begun
her
angling
for
the
goldfish
do
you
know
what
i
shall
do
mouse
said
she
i
shall
write
to
my
guardian
the
old
judge
and
ask
him
for
the
money
necessary
to
fit
out
an
expedition
then
i
shall
go
with
it
to
south
america
and
look
for
him
and
paint
halewitz
in
such
glowing
colours
that
he
get
homesick
and
come
back
to
europe
and
directly
we
reach
halewitz
i
shall
say
my
mission
is
ended
in
your
place
suggested
elly
i
should
marry
him
i
shall
never
marry
replied
hertha
i
am
an
orphan
and
shall
go
into
a
convent
leo
closed
his
eyes
with
an
amused
smile
this
charming
nonsense
was
music
to
him
meanwhile
the
drunken
merriment
in
the
bailiff
house
grew
louder
at
the
sound
of
it
hertha
spoke
her
mind
with
a
will
it
is
a
shame
that
an
end
can
not
be
put
to
such
mismanagement
the
master
roams
about
the
world
and
his
estates
are
going
to
ruin
do
you
think
it
really
is
so
bad
as
that
asked
elly
anxiously
it
is
so
bad
that
it
could
be
worse
look
at
ulrich
face
when
he
rides
over
here
but
he
can
do
nothing
it
was
not
he
who
was
given
full
authority
but
beautiful
uncle
kutowski
if
i
could
i
would
hound
that
fellow
out
of
the
place
with
a
spoken
like
a
thorough
good
chap
thought
leo
i
have
her
for
my
wife
and
then
they
find
there
be
the
devil
to
pay
yet
at
the
same
moment
anxiety
on
account
of
his
neglected
property
weighed
heavily
upon
his
soul
the
chorus
of
a
struck
up
opposite
the
refrain
ending
in
a
cadence
of
hiccoughs
leo
fists
itched
but
he
controlled
himself
for
he
did
not
wish
to
spoil
the
humour
of
the
situation
i
am
afraid
that
is
there
too
elly
whispered
hesitatingly
leo
was
all
attention
of
course
he
is
there
hertha
laughed
with
a
ring
of
scorn
in
her
voice
he
is
certain
to
be
wherever
there
is
anything
low
going
on
do
always
wound
my
feelings
elly
complained
you
know
how
gone
i
am
on
him
hum
so
the
little
one
has
begun
already
thought
leo
and
resolved
to
speak
to
her
seriously
for
falling
in
love
was
a
sellenthin
family
weakness
you
may
be
gone
on
him
as
much
as
you
like
replied
hertha
but
he
should
be
open
and
above
board
and
not
sneak
over
here
behind
backs
when
he
comes
to
see
uncle
kutowski
that
is
scarcely
fitting
behaviour
on
the
part
of
one
we
honour
with
our
admiration
but
what
else
is
he
to
do
asked
elly
in
a
troubled
voice
if
mamma
saw
him
she
would
tell
ulrich
that
he
was
hanging
about
and
the
last
time
he
only
came
through
the
park
to
serenade
me
and
that
song
smiling
stars
he
composed
especially
for
me
he
told
me
so
and
what
he
said
about
the
serenade
was
was
a
little
elated
by
wine
gracious
fräulein
otherwise
i
should
certainly
not
have
had
the
courage
he
always
speaks
so
modestly
and
politely
he
is
quite
out
of
the
common
just
wait
you
young
man
leo
said
to
himself
you
sha
escape
at
this
point
a
dear
familiar
voice
sent
forth
an
affectionate
warning
to
the
children
come
in
or
you
catch
cold
it
was
the
voice
in
which
as
long
as
he
could
remember
his
vagabond
spirit
had
ever
found
rest
and
steadfastness
he
bounded
up
and
clasped
the
espalier
with
both
hands
a
sudden
impulse
seized
him
to
rush
out
of
his
and
hug
the
dear
old
mother
to
his
breast
but
again
he
controlled
himself
before
he
returned
to
his
own
he
must
first
surprise
the
curious
company
at
the
bailiff
house
and
take
them
in
their
crimes
the
shimmering
light
which
had
made
the
chipped
heads
of
the
nymphs
glow
vanished
the
terrace
steps
were
lost
in
darkness
and
the
wooden
outer
door
creaked
on
its
hinges
then
all
was
still
the
coast
was
clear
for
leo
he
opened
the
which
connected
the
park
with
the
courtyard
and
went
by
a
familiar
path
in
the
direction
from
which
the
noises
becoming
more
and
more
tipsy
and
indistinct
echoed
over
the
sleeping
square
of
yard
not
a
single
dog
barked
all
apparently
being
too
well
accustomed
to
the
manners
of
this
particular
household
the
windows
of
the
bailiff
room
were
open
in
the
lamplight
clouds
of
could
be
seen
issuing
through
the
chinks
of
the
venetian
blinds
leo
leaned
against
the
so
that
he
could
look
in
on
the
topers
at
his
ease
the
company
lounged
comfortably
at
the
long
green
table
which
was
usually
loaded
with
official
papers
concerning
rents
and
rates
master
kutowski
presided
with
his
bristly
head
cropped
nearly
bald
his
long
waving
beard
abundantly
powdered
with
snuff
and
shading
from
silvery
white
to
with
his
light
glassy
moist
little
eyes
his
and
nose
he
presented
a
perfect
picture
of
the
convivial
sturdy
boon
companion
yet
one
who
if
brought
to
book
might
pose
easily
as
a
sober
worthy
rather
than
a
consummate
rascal
he
had
pushed
his
hungarian
fez
at
a
rakish
angle
over
his
left
ear
and
held
a
meerschaum
between
his
black
teeth
leo
recognized
it
it
bore
the
inscription
in
thanks
for
faithful
friendship
from
leo
sellenthin
on
either
side
of
him
two
guests
had
taken
their
places
who
were
not
resident
on
the
halewitz
estates
on
the
left
an
old
who
for
years
had
hung
about
the
neighbourhood
in
summer
sponging
on
the
hospitality
of
the
bailiffs
he
was
on
the
right
was
a
youth
whom
leo
seemed
to
know
but
could
not
put
a
name
to
his
smooth
but
somewhat
sallow
face
cut
about
with
diagonal
scars
like
a
rink
with
the
marks
of
skaters
stood
out
with
a
cool
rather
assumed
air
of
distinction
from
the
row
of
flushed
sunburnt
rustic
countenances
from
which
type
even
the
painter
with
its
full
stubbly
beard
scarcely
differed
the
youth
was
apparently
at
the
moment
the
only
person
sober
at
the
table
and
undoubtedly
he
was
the
only
one
who
had
cultivated
the
art
of
seriously
and
artistically
as
if
it
had
been
his
calling
in
life
next
came
right
and
left
the
two
bailiffs
of
halewitz
a
couple
of
stewards
from
the
neighbouring
estates
of
wengern
and
kantzendorf
and
four
raw
lads
to
all
appearances
pupils
of
the
lastly
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
was
the
lanky
brewer
who
superintended
the
pouring
out
of
the
drink
thus
the
whole
of
the
official
staff
to
whom
leo
property
had
been
entrusted
for
the
last
four
years
were
assembled
here
in
a
jovial
carousal
he
propped
his
chin
in
his
hands
feeling
the
grim
humour
of
the
situation
and
awaited
events
as
the
cat
watches
at
a
the
young
gentleman
with
the
gashed
face
who
was
addressed
as
herr
kandidat
and
seemed
to
enjoy
in
a
high
degree
the
respect
of
the
party
was
loudly
called
upon
to
give
them
a
solo
he
affected
to
refuse
at
first
have
compassion
on
your
own
ears
gentlemen
he
said
mincingly
in
the
exaggerated
lisping
accent
cultivated
by
our
student
contingent
he
pronounced
like
like
and
his
like
gurgling
then
he
began
to
sing
oh
smile
down
ye
smiling
stars
and
let
it
be
night
around
me
could
he
have
guessed
that
some
one
stood
listening
at
the
window
who
hailed
the
first
line
of
his
song
with
a
whistle
of
recognition
he
would
have
chosen
another
nevertheless
he
did
not
sing
badly
in
the
deep
notes
his
voice
sounded
soft
and
flexible
in
the
high
it
had
the
brilliant
falsetto
note
which
girls
are
apt
to
rave
about
his
delivery
with
its
sentimental
diminuendoes
and
coquettish
staccatoes
was
reminiscent
of
the
style
on
which
it
was
doubtless
modelled
at
any
rate
it
found
an
appreciative
public
now
a
storm
of
enthusiastic
applause
broke
forth
when
he
had
finished
long
live
the
singer
vivat
hurrah
bawled
uncle
kutowski
but
the
hero
thus
honoured
thought
fit
to
cavil
one
generally
says
to
the
singer
in
such
cases
he
said
stiffening
into
frigid
dignity
the
old
man
suggested
that
it
did
matter
as
long
as
one
was
sociable
and
friendly
that
was
the
chief
thing
and
the
painter
who
for
some
while
had
been
gazing
into
his
glass
in
a
profound
reverie
suddenly
uttered
a
deep
groan
which
resounded
terrifically
down
the
table
this
ejaculation
of
misery
caused
a
fresh
outburst
of
merriment
the
revellers
began
to
exceed
all
bounds
only
the
student
with
the
slashed
face
smiled
with
meditative
deliberation
he
drank
a
special
toast
to
the
health
of
the
despairing
painter
and
made
him
a
bow
fit
for
a
prince
silence
gentlemen
commanded
uncle
knocking
on
the
side
of
his
plate
with
his
pipe
now
i
am
going
to
make
you
a
speech
all
at
once
forgetting
his
dignity
the
candidate
yelled
forth
long
live
all
jolly
good
fellows
in
the
midst
of
our
rejoicing
continued
uncle
kutowski
we
will
not
omit
to
think
with
gratitude
of
our
noble
host
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
this
and
other
enjoyable
evenings
hear
hear
chortled
the
candidate
he
hiccoughed
and
then
became
stonily
immovable
again
my
dear
nephew
leo
who
well
knows
what
a
treasure
he
possesses
in
his
grateful
old
uncle
honest
old
uncle
kutowski
who
would
rather
drink
nothing
but
water
and
never
go
out
with
a
girl
than
not
do
his
duty
to
the
death
now
then
you
may
howl
if
you
like
you
instead
of
the
painter
the
candidate
set
up
a
howl
in
which
the
whole
company
joined
this
leo
the
old
man
went
on
knowing
that
in
comparison
with
his
old
uncle
genius
for
management
his
would
be
nowhere
shook
the
dust
of
the
place
from
his
feet
and
has
now
been
wandering
about
the
world
for
years
in
order
it
would
appear
not
to
disturb
our
pleasant
little
gatherings
with
the
annoyance
of
his
presence
the
capital
young
man
can
not
be
praised
sufficiently
for
so
much
tender
consideration
let
us
therefore
drink
to
my
aristocratic
nephew
leo
von
sellenthin
long
may
he
live
and
good
evening
my
friends
leo
said
opening
the
door
and
thinking
that
he
could
not
possibly
have
had
a
better
cue
than
this
for
his
entry
on
to
the
stage
there
was
a
terrible
silence
the
brewer
who
was
a
tall
old
bavarian
crossed
himself
the
bailiffs
ducked
their
heads
as
if
they
expected
blows
the
candidate
stood
with
his
hand
glued
to
his
budding
moustache
and
uncle
kutowski
the
honest
old
uncle
stared
at
his
nephew
with
a
face
as
white
as
chalk
a
blue
tip
to
his
nose
and
the
tankard
of
beer
still
held
in
his
upraised
hand
in
an
attitude
of
involuntary
welcome
it
happened
that
a
diversion
was
made
at
this
moment
by
the
to
which
the
brewer
had
been
clinging
as
to
a
rock
of
refuge
tumbling
off
its
stand
and
rolling
with
a
violent
crashing
noise
under
leo
feet
he
kicked
it
aside
and
let
his
glance
pass
contemptuously
from
one
face
to
the
other
the
student
with
the
scarred
countenance
was
the
first
to
collect
himself
he
rose
deliberately
and
with
a
persuasive
eloquence
which
doubtless
he
had
had
opportunities
of
practising
as
university
orator
he
began
really
you
have
come
home
just
at
the
propitious
moment
herr
von
sellenthin
just
when
your
friends
and
confidential
servants
are
festively
met
together
to
do
honour
to
their
absent
squire
being
the
anniversary
of
of
he
hummed
and
hawed
trying
to
improvise
speedily
something
that
would
give
the
day
an
important
significance
which
he
probably
would
have
accomplished
had
not
leo
saved
him
the
trouble
with
whom
have
i
the
pleasure
of
speaking
he
asked
towering
to
his
full
height
over
the
wretched
youth
kurt
brenckenberg
guestphaliæ
normanneæque
he
answered
beginning
to
swell
visibly
leo
grinned
do
you
belong
to
the
house
what
i
i
am
here
as
herr
von
kutowski
guest
answered
the
youth
loftily
that
scarcely
gives
you
the
right
to
bid
me
welcome
on
my
on
domain
kindly
do
me
the
favour
to
put
a
bridle
on
your
joy
at
seeing
me
till
you
are
asked
the
sharp
forward
boy
collapsed
and
swore
fearfully
to
himself
well
hang
it
all
leo
exclaimed
flashing
a
glance
down
the
table
does
no
one
offer
me
a
chair
a
greeting
or
a
glass
of
beer
now
i
am
on
my
own
property
again
every
one
jumped
up
and
the
tankard
fell
clattering
from
uncle
kutowski
rigid
hand
on
to
the
board
which
it
flooded
from
one
end
to
the
other
with
brown
streams
leo
acted
as
if
this
mishap
made
him
aware
of
the
old
man
presence
for
the
first
time
what
uncle
you
here
too
he
cried
i
was
under
the
impression
that
i
had
strayed
into
a
party
of
juveniles
who
were
enjoying
a
little
harmless
lark
behind
your
back
and
i
was
about
to
have
a
drink
with
them
but
now
of
course
the
matter
takes
a
different
complexion
do
things
go
on
like
this
every
night
dear
uncle
he
was
answered
by
gloomy
silence
one
of
the
stewards
of
outlying
estates
had
in
the
meanwhile
made
an
attempt
to
get
out
at
the
door
unobserved
but
leo
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
in
the
nick
of
time
so
old
friend
said
he
you
want
to
be
off
without
shaking
hands
certainly
at
eleven
at
night
or
rather
looking
at
the
timepiece
at
there
is
precious
little
to
do
at
halewitz
it
would
have
been
better
perhaps
not
to
have
let
yourself
been
seen
here
at
all
so
off
with
you
and
make
haste
at
this
bidding
not
one
but
two
men
disappeared
through
the
door
leo
looked
after
them
laughing
and
then
turned
to
the
two
bailiffs
who
ashamed
and
anxious
stared
into
vacancy
with
watery
eyes
we
all
know
the
pretty
proverb
gentlemen
with
the
hare
and
hunt
with
the
hounds
you
have
all
been
hunting
good
sport
i
can
agree
with
you
but
who
the
hounds
are
is
what
i
am
now
elucidating
he
looked
keenly
at
the
old
man
who
seemed
to
have
composed
himself
somewhat
and
sat
frowning
moodily
the
reprimanded
couple
fetched
their
caps
and
departed
without
a
word
now
it
was
the
turn
of
the
four
striplings
he
measured
the
slight
overgrown
figures
that
stood
drawn
up
before
him
like
a
row
of
scarecrows
with
a
wondering
amused
glance
will
you
kindly
introduce
me
to
these
gentlemen
dear
uncle
introduce
you
eh
why
the
dickens
should
i
introduce
you
to
them
well
then
i
am
waiting
but
it
pleased
the
old
man
to
keep
silent
he
puffed
out
clouds
of
smoke
and
sulked
leo
let
him
be
some
time
elapsed
before
he
elicited
any
clear
information
with
regard
to
the
name
and
character
of
the
lads
since
when
has
halewitz
taken
pupils
since
i
have
been
agent
here
my
son
leo
eyes
flashed
but
he
checked
himself
i
advise
you
to
write
to
your
respective
fathers
young
men
and
tell
them
that
for
the
future
halewitz
can
get
on
very
well
without
you
now
then
off
to
bed
they
made
their
bow
and
sidled
out
the
green
table
had
emptied
fast
and
only
the
uncle
and
his
two
guests
still
sat
on
at
the
upper
end
the
brewer
pretended
to
busy
himself
with
his
cask
in
the
leo
signed
to
him
laughing
am
i
going
to
get
a
glass
of
beer
to
welcome
me
at
last
sigilhöfer
if
you
like
sir
the
bavarian
stammered
forth
in
awed
delight
and
held
a
tankard
under
the
tap
with
a
trembling
hand
leo
drank
and
wiped
his
moustache
not
bad
sigilhof
he
said
in
praise
offering
his
hand
that
the
first
real
greeting
i
have
had
since
i
set
foot
in
my
home
the
brewer
went
to
the
door
beaming
with
happiness
and
satisfaction
at
having
got
off
so
easily
uncle
kutowski
and
the
candidate
drew
closer
together
convulsed
by
every
gradation
of
fury
while
the
painter
stared
vacantly
on
the
ground
lost
in
lugubrious
thought
suddenly
the
candidate
started
up
took
three
steps
towards
leo
bowed
and
smiled
affectedly
and
drawled
through
his
nose
i
beg
pardon
but
i
must
ask
you
to
give
me
satisfaction
leo
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
from
his
six
feet
of
height
eyed
from
head
to
foot
the
anæmic
youth
who
was
endeavouring
in
vain
to
assume
an
air
of
dignified
disdain
then
he
laughed
and
said
so
you
are
the
son
of
dear
old
papa
brenckenberg
my
father
is
pastor
brenckenberg
of
wengern
snarled
the
pugnacious
young
man
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
how
is
the
dear
old
papa
i
have
asked
you
to
give
me
satisfaction
sir
remember
me
to
your
father
congratulate
him
from
me
on
having
reared
so
promising
and
sober
a
sprig
for
a
son
what
do
you
mean
remember
sir
that
i
am
a
corps
student
then
i
am
afraid
young
man
that
you
have
to
put
your
nose
to
the
grindstone
answered
leo
before
you
become
anything
better
the
candidate
gave
a
swaggering
bow
there
is
nothing
to
detain
me
here
longer
he
said
have
you
only
now
discovered
that
leo
asked
turning
his
back
on
him
but
wait
a
moment
one
thing
more
you
may
tell
your
good
old
papa
and
that
is
i
should
advise
him
to
put
a
stop
to
his
gentlemanly
son
loafing
about
in
halewitz
park
when
other
people
are
in
bed
with
the
object
of
singing
pretty
songs
there
otherwise
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
said
young
gentleman
may
be
brought
home
to
him
the
next
morning
suffering
from
young
brenckenberg
gave
him
a
look
of
supreme
contempt
and
fuming
like
a
strutted
to
the
door
one
after
the
other
thought
leo
and
turned
to
the
painter
when
it
dawned
on
him
that
it
was
now
his
turn
to
be
dealt
with
he
jumped
up
and
fell
on
the
bosom
of
the
returned
squire
weeping
hysterically
kick
me
out
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
lamentation
kick
me
out
like
the
rest
i
deserve
it
i
am
a
loafer
a
sluggard
i
waste
god
daylight
my
cows
all
have
too
long
legs
so
the
critics
say
but
i
swear
it
is
true
i
take
my
oath
to
you
an
honourable
man
that
cows
have
long
legs
of
course
dear
old
fellow
calm
yourself
now
i
have
given
up
painting
them
with
legs
at
all
i
make
them
legless
like
seals
serves
those
blackguard
critics
right
but
you
are
my
salvation
say
you
will
be
on
my
side
promise
leo
promised
everything
as
he
pushed
the
drunkard
firmly
back
in
his
chair
you
will
see
to
the
man
uncle
he
growled
out
an
insolent
answer
leo
felt
the
blood
mount
hotly
to
his
temples
but
a
voice
within
him
said
keep
quiet
do
embitter
this
hour
of
homecoming
so
he
forced
himself
to
calmness
as
he
said
i
beg
that
you
will
remember
your
position
my
dear
uncle
the
old
man
spat
copiously
around
then
with
a
defiant
grin
that
was
a
sort
of
challenge
he
said
it
seems
to
me
that
i
know
my
position
better
than
you
do
my
boy
at
any
rate
i
must
ask
you
not
to
take
me
to
task
again
before
other
people
else
i
shall
be
bound
to
jog
your
memory
a
little
a
shudder
ran
through
leo
frame
again
the
ghost
of
his
old
sin
rose
before
him
sleep
off
your
debauch
he
murmured
and
strode
hastily
to
the
door
it
was
quiet
and
dark
in
the
courtyard
the
cool
night
breezes
fanned
leo
burning
brow
but
he
was
not
conscious
of
it
foaming
at
the
mouth
with
clenched
fists
he
passed
the
stables
whence
now
and
again
the
snort
of
a
dreaming
animal
or
the
rattle
of
a
chain
fell
on
his
ear
the
wrath
which
hitherto
it
had
needed
the
exercise
of
all
his
to
suppress
now
that
he
was
alone
broke
forth
the
more
violently
he
had
leisure
to
rave
himself
out
no
one
disturbed
him
and
it
was
only
the
iron
head
of
a
which
he
nearly
ran
into
in
the
darkness
which
brought
him
to
his
senses
suddenly
he
laughed
out
loud
the
old
yankee
game
for
life
or
death
at
which
he
had
so
often
played
so
audaciously
and
won
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
should
serve
him
in
tame
old
europe
too
to
stop
the
mouth
of
his
refractory
conscience
so
folding
his
arms
as
content
as
a
schoolboy
who
has
bethought
him
of
some
new
trick
to
play
off
on
a
comrade
he
walked
up
the
incline
to
the
castle
which
stood
out
a
solid
black
mass
of
masonry
against
the
dark
blue
of
the
midnight
sky
behind
him
the
farm
buildings
and
offices
formed
a
huge
semicircle
grouped
round
the
pond
whose
surface
reflected
the
faint
uncertain
dawn
of
midnight
a
solitary
light
still
shone
from
one
of
the
castle
upstair
windows
he
was
seized
with
jubilant
longing
hurrah
now
for
mother
he
exclaimed
throwing
his
cap
up
in
the
air
it
flew
over
the
hedge
and
fell
into
the
garden
shall
i
present
myself
at
the
door
of
my
home
without
a
cap
in
true
vagabond
fashion
he
asked
himself
with
a
laugh
but
he
was
given
no
time
to
reflect
on
the
matter
for
his
shout
had
awakened
one
of
the
whose
bark
was
echoed
in
a
distant
chorus
from
one
or
two
other
directions
the
animals
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
an
innovation
on
the
part
of
uncle
kutowski
to
ensure
the
calves
of
his
nocturnal
going
uninjured
then
he
thought
of
his
friend
leo
once
in
a
mood
he
had
taken
into
his
head
to
have
his
favourite
hound
christened
by
his
own
name
so
that
the
fellows
should
know
he
had
explained
that
they
were
to
esteem
the
fine
beast
as
his
representative
leo
he
cried
with
all
the
strength
of
his
lungs
for
a
moment
there
was
a
dead
silence
leo
he
called
a
second
time
and
then
an
din
arose
the
animals
seemed
suddenly
to
have
gone
mad
with
their
howls
was
mingled
the
clang
of
shaken
chains
and
the
gnashing
of
their
teeth
as
they
bit
on
the
iron
links
joyous
delight
faithful
yearning
all
the
emotions
which
can
sway
the
breast
of
a
living
creature
found
moving
expression
in
the
wild
ecstasy
of
these
animals
leo
felt
his
eyes
grow
moist
it
is
time
i
came
indeed
thought
he
he
made
the
knocker
of
the
outer
portal
resound
threateningly
through
the
house
the
echo
came
back
on
his
ear
in
reverberating
waves
then
the
window
of
the
room
where
the
light
was
was
pushed
open
and
a
white
figure
leaned
out
who
is
there
called
a
woman
voice
which
he
knew
at
once
johanna
is
it
you
there
was
a
cry
but
it
seemed
to
leo
that
it
was
not
by
any
means
a
cry
of
pleasure
his
sister
figure
disappeared
two
long
anxious
moments
he
waited
at
the
door
the
dogs
went
on
howling
people
began
to
stir
in
the
stables
and
call
each
other
lanterns
flashed
hither
and
thither
at
last
hurrying
footsteps
were
heard
within
crossing
the
hall
amidst
sounds
half
of
laughing
half
of
weeping
the
key
turned
the
bolts
ground
back
and
there
she
was
dear
fat
bright
old
lady
her
nightcap
awry
on
her
curly
grey
hair
her
white
buttoned
up
long
odd
slippers
on
her
feet
there
she
stood
holding
the
candle
high
in
her
trembling
hand
while
glistening
tear
after
tear
rolled
down
her
cheeks
leo
my
dear
boy
my
dear
dear
boy
the
caressing
confused
murmur
was
half
shy
as
if
she
hardly
dared
all
at
once
to
take
the
son
as
son
to
her
bosom
then
she
gave
herself
a
little
shake
and
clung
round
his
neck
while
the
candle
she
still
held
trickled
grease
down
his
back
the
silence
of
this
embrace
was
broken
by
the
heartrending
howling
and
whining
of
the
dogs
who
yearned
for
their
master
with
all
their
lungs
his
mother
noticed
the
noise
do
they
know
already
she
asked
as
she
straightened
herself
and
reaching
up
took
his
head
between
her
hands
he
nodded
and
kissed
the
fingers
that
glided
over
his
cheeks
with
an
anxious
touch
then
a
new
wave
of
joy
overpowered
her
she
put
the
candle
on
the
stairs
and
cowering
beside
it
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
wept
bitterly
he
was
seized
with
a
sense
of
shame
all
this
love
and
longing
had
been
waiting
for
him
and
he
with
a
brutal
thirst
for
seeing
life
had
simply
turned
his
back
on
it
and
gone
his
way
he
bent
over
her
and
half
consciously
and
half
absently
stroked
the
crochet
edging
of
her
nightcap
from
which
the
grey
hair
escaped
in
scanty
little
curls
another
light
cast
its
radiance
from
the
back
of
the
hall
and
an
infirm
old
figure
came
forward
trembling
and
hesitating
his
mother
dropped
her
hands
and
laughing
through
her
tears
called
out
come
christian
come
do
be
frightened
you
stupid
fellow
it
really
is
he
look
at
him
and
see
for
yourself
that
it
is
the
old
butler
arrayed
in
leo
old
and
leo
old
slippers
in
his
joy
and
astonishment
let
candle
and
matches
fall
with
a
crash
on
the
floor
tender
and
servile
half
slave
and
half
father
he
bent
over
the
master
hand
wiping
away
nervously
his
tears
a
fresh
feeling
of
shame
took
possession
of
leo
what
a
wonderful
thing
was
the
faithful
soul
of
such
old
servants
he
thought
no
matter
how
you
might
have
bullied
and
abused
them
all
your
life
they
still
clung
to
you
and
worshipped
you
as
a
god
and
then
aloud
he
said
that
enough
now
christian
we
shall
have
other
opportunities
of
rejoicing
together
go
and
let
the
dogs
loose
or
the
brutes
will
go
mad
the
old
man
wrapped
his
over
his
poor
aged
ribs
which
had
been
exposed
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
and
withdrew
on
tottering
legs
without
saying
a
word
meanwhile
the
mother
had
begun
to
be
ashamed
of
her
outer
woman
and
after
she
had
kindled
a
light
in
the
she
hurried
away
to
put
on
a
dress
still
undecided
between
laughing
and
crying
leo
was
alone
the
hanging
lamp
which
he
had
seen
earlier
casting
a
glory
about
the
heads
of
the
two
young
girls
seemed
to
greet
him
with
its
light
half
his
life
his
dreams
his
happiness
and
his
sins
all
were
associated
with
this
flame
which
had
shone
upon
his
youth
like
some
dear
silent
confidential
friend
he
walked
round
the
table
with
striding
steps
in
the
middle
of
it
was
the
old
majolica
vase
with
open
dragons
jaws
where
a
bunch
of
de
roses
languished
exhausted
from
the
heat
of
the
day
knitting
and
an
album
lay
beside
it
and
on
top
the
lady
cook
which
she
was
in
the
habit
of
leaving
here
open
when
she
went
to
bed
so
it
had
been
thirty
years
ago
so
it
was
his
eye
wandered
to
the
walls
there
hung
the
same
old
pictures
nelson
at
the
battle
of
trafalgar
brave
nelson
with
his
compass
and
telescope
in
the
midst
of
clouds
of
gunpowder
and
fiery
zigzags
when
he
was
six
years
old
he
had
played
at
being
nelson
and
constructed
a
deck
and
bridge
of
chairs
while
ulrich
and
johanna
cried
hurrah
and
had
to
fire
guns
by
striking
matches
this
brought
johanna
to
his
mind
what
was
she
doing
why
did
she
come
and
throw
herself
into
his
arms
ah
she
is
making
herself
smart
he
thought
and
chuckled
the
famous
clock
which
his
grandfather
had
brought
from
paris
anno
still
stood
on
the
bureau
with
its
bulky
drawers
and
gilded
feet
the
dock
represented
a
victoria
the
wheel
of
the
gold
triumphal
chariot
formed
the
dial
and
every
time
it
struck
the
hour
the
flaming
sun
which
formed
its
axle
revolved
with
a
hum
like
a
over
the
bureau
was
the
portrait
framed
in
its
own
horns
of
the
stag
with
sixteen
antlers
which
king
frederick
william
in
the
year
had
shot
in
his
official
capacity
of
royal
ranger
the
daughter
and
the
two
coquettish
old
dresden
figures
standing
on
either
side
on
the
rickety
consols
still
cast
amorous
glances
at
each
other
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
they
became
every
year
older
and
so
more
valuable
all
the
dear
old
ornaments
stood
in
their
familiar
places
the
chalk
bust
of
frederick
william
iv
on
the
cigar
cabinet
whose
complexion
long
years
of
and
had
turned
a
deep
had
been
given
no
successor
at
halewitz
the
reigns
of
three
german
emperors
seemed
to
have
passed
without
making
any
impression
leo
wandered
from
one
article
to
another
examined
and
tested
everything
he
took
in
his
hand
never
weary
of
celebrating
anew
this
meeting
again
with
old
acquaintances
suddenly
there
arose
in
the
hall
a
noise
like
the
rush
of
a
whirlwind
a
concert
of
yapping
barking
and
growling
the
door
flew
open
and
the
whole
pack
rushed
in
quite
off
their
heads
for
joy
and
affection
with
tongues
lolling
out
and
jaws
biting
and
knocking
each
other
over
they
jumped
up
on
him
as
if
they
would
smother
him
with
their
embraces
leo
took
the
lead
his
namesake
then
came
two
fine
bulldogs
who
kept
guard
in
the
stable
the
scotch
greyhounds
whose
ancestors
his
father
had
got
for
coursing
the
chow
who
in
furious
jealousy
bit
the
others
legs
even
the
old
fat
pug
belonging
to
his
mother
that
he
had
never
given
anything
but
kicks
would
not
be
left
behind
in
choking
and
snorting
forth
a
joyous
welcome
but
as
is
always
the
case
the
least
worthy
claim
the
largest
share
of
love
and
the
wildest
demonstrations
were
made
by
a
young
hound
which
of
course
he
had
never
seen
before
he
managed
to
leap
clean
over
the
shaggy
back
of
the
leonberger
on
to
his
master
knee
and
began
licking
his
ears
with
zeal
leo
shook
himself
free
laughing
and
turned
his
canine
lovers
with
an
upset
chair
out
of
the
room
only
his
namesake
was
allowed
to
stay
he
stretched
himself
at
his
feet
with
dignified
composure
and
drank
in
draughts
of
the
master
scent
as
one
who
enjoys
an
unsurpassed
delicacy
then
his
mother
reappeared
she
had
taken
off
her
nightcap
and
put
on
a
morning
gown
the
grey
hair
had
been
hurriedly
smoothed
and
there
was
even
a
brooch
showing
under
her
chin
like
all
mothers
when
their
sons
come
back
to
them
from
distant
countries
she
asked
him
if
he
was
hungry
no
he
said
he
was
only
tired
a
pleasant
sensation
of
slackness
had
taken
possession
of
his
limbs
three
hours
sleep
and
then
the
work
of
managing
the
neglected
estate
should
begin
but
where
was
johanna
all
this
time
she
who
had
first
caught
sight
of
him
surely
she
could
not
have
gone
to
bed
without
giving
him
a
welcome
the
question
seemed
to
embarrass
his
mother
she
asked
you
to
excuse
her
she
answered
because
she
did
feel
quite
prepared
to
meet
you
at
least
now
upon
my
word
little
mother
how
long
is
it
since
preparations
have
been
necessary
between
johanna
and
me
for
answer
his
mother
made
a
wry
face
and
taking
his
hand
in
hers
stroked
it
gently
there
is
something
wrong
here
too
he
thought
and
resolved
to
investigate
the
matter
thoroughly
early
the
next
morning
but
the
mother
whose
memory
was
short
began
laughing
again
what
a
big
beard
you
grown
she
said
admiringly
and
how
your
hair
is
and
you
are
brown
oh
so
brown
you
look
exactly
as
if
you
had
come
from
the
man
oe
uvres
and
while
she
fondled
him
her
gaze
rested
on
him
in
a
shy
scrutiny
there
was
an
undertone
of
anxiety
in
her
manner
despite
her
proud
tenderness
he
had
come
home
as
a
kind
of
prodigal
son
his
soul
had
fed
on
husks
and
yet
he
had
thrived
on
them
withal
between
mother
and
son
there
was
much
that
was
difficult
to
speak
of
and
what
was
most
difficult
of
all
would
have
to
remain
unspoken
i
will
go
and
see
if
your
bed
is
ready
she
said
rising
and
combing
the
ends
of
his
beard
with
her
hand
in
passing
as
she
opened
the
door
into
the
next
room
which
was
in
darkness
she
started
back
with
a
cry
answered
by
a
simultaneous
only
more
alarmed
exclamation
from
the
other
side
at
the
same
instant
leo
saw
a
glimmer
of
something
white
and
then
another
disappear
into
the
darkness
mamma
turned
to
him
and
said
with
a
titter
it
was
the
girls
the
lovely
double
picture
that
he
had
seen
on
the
terrace
rose
before
his
eyes
come
in
he
called
out
and
stood
up
as
if
he
were
going
to
the
door
but
his
mother
stopped
him
laughing
for
goodness
sake
let
them
run
away
to
bed
she
said
they
were
in
their
nightgowns
v
the
first
grey
shafts
of
dawn
that
shone
through
the
curtains
of
the
girls
bedroom
were
beginning
to
take
a
rosy
hue
the
starlings
had
begun
to
chatter
outside
the
window
and
the
young
swallows
trilled
softly
in
the
eaves
a
mighty
volume
of
sound
coming
from
the
courtyard
seemed
for
a
moment
to
fill
the
whole
universe
with
noise
and
unrest
and
then
with
three
single
resounding
strokes
to
come
to
an
end
while
elly
slept
on
with
rounded
cheek
and
right
ear
resting
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
in
undisturbed
slumber
hertha
lay
with
eyes
holding
the
counterpane
between
her
teeth
and
let
the
clang
of
the
which
generally
used
to
hunt
her
out
of
bed
at
once
die
on
her
ear
she
had
not
been
able
to
go
to
sleep
again
after
the
night
great
event
elly
when
the
first
outbreak
of
joy
was
over
and
after
she
had
hazarded
a
few
guesses
as
to
what
presents
her
brother
had
brought
with
him
had
nestled
her
head
down
on
the
pillows
peacefully
but
hertha
had
stayed
in
a
sitting
position
thinking
and
thinking
without
ceasing
often
she
had
pictured
to
herself
what
this
ought
to
be
and
now
it
had
happened
quite
differently
from
what
she
had
expected
everything
always
did
happen
differently
from
what
you
expected
so
much
wisdom
her
young
life
had
taught
her
long
ago
it
dated
from
the
day
when
her
beautiful
mother
had
been
carried
away
from
her
in
her
shroud
papa
was
dead
too
and
hertha
thanked
god
for
that
often
there
was
a
hardness
in
her
nature
which
made
her
lips
snap
together
at
the
thought
of
him
now
she
was
living
amongst
strangers
and
felt
herself
at
home
her
stepmother
people
had
become
her
own
her
guardian
satisfied
that
she
was
being
well
brought
up
at
halewitz
contented
himself
with
the
management
of
her
fortune
and
trouble
himself
about
her
mamma
went
her
own
way
also
living
a
solitary
life
seeing
scarcely
anybody
but
the
poor
people
children
whom
she
gathered
about
her
every
day
then
there
was
grandmamma
dear
old
granny
she
scolded
a
good
bit
she
scolded
in
the
morning
and
scolded
in
the
evening
but
her
scolding
was
sheer
love
and
after
all
you
ended
by
doing
what
you
liked
and
of
course
that
was
nothing
wrong
on
the
contrary
you
had
an
object
in
life
for
which
you
planned
and
worked
and
fought
which
was
your
last
thought
at
night
before
going
to
sleep
and
seeing
for
the
sake
of
which
you
tumbled
half
blind
out
of
bed
when
the
morning
bell
sounded
its
first
hard
clanging
notes
the
dairy
the
and
the
vegetable
garden
these
were
her
little
kingdom
over
which
she
had
ruled
for
more
than
a
year
now
since
grandmamma
had
abdicated
and
given
over
the
management
of
them
to
her
she
had
had
to
beg
long
for
it
seemed
only
natural
that
the
tired
lax
fingers
of
the
old
lady
should
drop
the
reins
and
confide
them
to
her
strong
brown
paws
she
was
passionately
devoted
to
riding
yet
the
superb
lithuanian
mare
which
had
once
belonged
to
leo
was
now
left
at
peace
in
the
stable
she
could
drive
like
a
goddess
but
for
months
she
had
not
taken
the
ribbons
between
her
fingers
for
this
reason
more
than
anything
else
that
she
had
lost
her
pleasure
in
it
had
she
not
plunged
into
a
world
of
responsibility
and
cares
she
looked
back
on
her
work
with
genuine
pride
now
it
was
coming
to
an
end
for
had
come
home
she
had
laid
the
foundation
of
what
he
would
sit
in
judgment
upon
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
slipped
into
her
petticoats
as
she
pulled
back
one
of
the
curtains
she
saw
the
garden
stretched
out
before
her
in
the
rosy
glow
of
early
morning
night
still
brooded
in
the
heart
of
the
dark
limes
but
on
the
lawn
lay
the
reflection
of
early
sunlight
she
opened
a
softly
and
breathed
in
the
cool
dewy
morning
air
a
little
shiver
ran
down
her
naked
arms
she
then
placed
herself
before
the
which
stood
between
the
two
windows
and
was
hung
with
flowered
chintz
and
ornamented
with
a
gilded
and
as
she
combed
her
long
rather
coarse
hair
she
subjected
herself
to
a
searching
examination
never
before
had
she
been
so
unpleasantly
alive
to
the
thinness
of
her
shoulders
and
the
undeveloped
childish
curves
of
her
bosom
which
were
scarcely
perceptible
above
the
grey
calico
corset
neither
was
the
brown
slender
throat
on
which
her
small
head
was
posed
so
firmly
and
haughtily
at
all
to
her
taste
her
arms
were
plentifully
adorned
with
scars
and
scratches
they
were
without
roundness
and
the
keen
morning
air
had
given
them
a
appearance
simply
hideous
exclaimed
hertha
then
she
hastily
got
into
a
scarlet
blouse
which
in
honour
of
the
day
she
fastened
with
a
spray
of
sparkling
garnets
and
ended
by
thinking
that
she
looked
quite
passable
as
she
opened
the
door
into
the
corridor
her
heart
began
to
beat
fast
at
any
moment
she
might
meet
him
the
courtyard
was
busier
than
usual
at
this
time
of
the
morning
when
she
went
to
the
stable
for
the
milking
excited
little
groups
stood
at
the
doors
and
a
groom
or
two
were
running
up
and
down
anxiously
between
the
carriages
as
if
the
threatened
storm
were
already
bursting
over
their
heads
she
was
on
the
point
of
entering
the
where
the
were
already
rattling
when
a
suddenly
born
sense
of
shame
prevented
her
would
it
not
look
as
if
she
in
her
unbidden
zeal
were
pushing
herself
before
him
but
she
suppressed
the
feeling
as
weakness
people
must
do
their
duty
without
looking
to
right
or
left
the
milkmaids
work
was
in
full
swing
the
white
streaks
of
milk
shot
with
a
hissing
sound
into
the
tilted
pails
she
walked
down
the
line
and
found
that
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
do
no
one
turned
to
look
at
her
it
had
always
been
her
wish
that
no
one
should
interrupt
their
work
to
bid
her
good
morning
her
inactivity
made
her
feel
somehow
excessively
foolish
if
only
some
one
would
have
beaten
her
cow
so
that
she
might
thunder
a
rebuke
it
would
have
been
a
relief
but
all
went
on
greased
wheels
the
udders
were
sprinkled
with
tepid
water
the
milking
hands
shone
with
cleanliness
fortunately
a
red
brindle
would
not
stand
still
and
stamped
with
its
hind
hoof
at
the
pail
she
fetched
quickly
a
little
bag
of
sand
kept
for
the
purpose
and
laid
on
the
restless
back
as
she
did
so
she
looked
nervously
in
the
direction
of
the
stable
door
suppose
he
was
to
come
in
now
she
would
be
ready
to
sink
into
the
earth
who
are
you
he
might
ask
the
mamselle
no
i
am
so
and
so
and
what
brings
you
here
he
would
ask
further
is
this
fit
work
for
countess
prachwitz
in
short
it
would
be
altogether
dreadful
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
pretty
dutch
cow
with
a
clever
head
that
was
one
of
her
favourites
was
seriously
distended
she
thought
that
while
in
the
meadow
it
must
have
been
allowed
to
graze
on
a
patch
of
poisonous
clover
she
called
the
cowherd
reproved
him
and
charged
him
to
keep
his
eye
on
the
animal
for
the
rest
of
the
day
if
necessary
he
was
to
send
for
help
in
order
that
the
might
be
inserted
while
the
white
foamy
steaming
contents
of
the
first
pails
were
being
poured
into
the
a
voice
suddenly
was
heard
outside
the
resonant
tone
of
which
made
her
blood
freeze
in
her
veins
it
was
he
since
midnight
that
voice
had
rung
in
her
ears
but
the
laugh
which
had
given
it
a
cheery
sound
then
was
absent
from
it
now
it
was
he
in
another
moment
perhaps
he
would
be
standing
in
the
stable
doorway
she
waited
clinging
to
a
post
and
setting
her
teeth
but
he
did
not
come
he
ordered
a
horse
to
be
brought
out
and
his
words
of
and
command
darted
hither
and
thither
like
the
milkmaids
too
heard
the
master
voice
some
knew
it
and
those
who
did
could
not
be
in
a
moment
doubt
as
to
whom
it
belonged
they
nudged
each
other
with
their
elbows
and
their
faces
expressed
alarm
when
hertha
heard
the
sound
of
horse
feet
dying
away
beneath
the
courtyard
gateway
she
ventured
to
look
out
at
the
door
of
him
she
could
not
see
much
but
he
was
riding
on
her
white
mare
on
her
mare
what
joy
she
watched
the
measuring
of
the
milk
with
an
absent
eye
one
part
of
it
went
to
münsterberg
in
the
a
second
portion
came
up
to
the
house
a
third
was
for
the
farm
servants
the
midday
and
evening
milking
supplied
the
when
all
was
finished
she
stepped
again
into
the
morning
air
the
sun
which
had
risen
above
the
haystacks
cast
its
fiery
beams
on
the
yard
down
by
the
pond
where
the
velvet
bulrushes
glistened
with
silvery
dew
ducks
were
quacking
the
dogs
struggled
straining
on
their
chains
to
get
to
her
she
took
no
notice
of
them
she
passed
the
brewery
from
which
proceeded
a
stream
of
barm
which
filled
the
surrounding
air
with
a
odour
and
entered
the
open
fields
by
the
back
gate
here
a
few
patches
of
wheat
had
been
cut
because
they
came
handy
to
uncle
but
farther
away
the
corn
stood
with
rotting
ears
in
thought
she
followed
leo
ride
with
an
anxious
conscience
as
if
she
were
to
blame
for
all
the
mischief
he
must
have
come
by
this
spot
and
that
and
found
one
as
neglected
as
the
other
ground
had
been
left
from
last
winter
unploughed
oats
had
been
sown
too
late
the
clover
was
nearly
overgrown
by
grass
and
weeds
amongst
the
stubble
glittered
a
fine
spangle
of
cobwebs
spreading
a
prescience
of
autumn
over
the
flat
stretches
of
land
a
wild
cat
with
head
ducked
forward
was
slinking
along
the
furrows
hertha
was
vexed
that
she
had
a
gun
with
her
so
that
she
might
singe
the
fur
then
gradually
her
zeal
evaporated
and
a
gentle
dreaminess
stole
over
her
she
saw
him
again
us
she
had
always
seen
him
ever
since
grandmamma
had
begun
to
enchant
her
eyes
by
drawing
his
picture
pale
melancholy
rushing
in
a
frenzy
of
restlessness
about
foreign
countries
tormented
by
the
shade
of
the
slain
hunted
from
pillar
to
post
by
nostalgia
and
vain
longing
for
rest
and
peace
for
long
she
had
believed
herself
chosen
by
heaven
to
be
his
good
angel
she
was
not
exactly
clear
how
and
when
this
revelation
had
come
to
her
perhaps
it
was
when
elly
told
the
story
at
school
of
his
duel
of
his
detention
in
a
fortress
and
afterwards
of
his
flight
over
sea
this
duel
had
been
the
first
romance
she
had
heard
of
in
real
life
at
a
time
when
she
hardly
knew
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
romance
then
afterwards
grandmamma
had
taught
her
to
hold
her
virgin
heart
in
reserve
for
the
son
and
now
he
had
come
and
although
she
had
not
yet
seen
him
face
to
face
one
thing
she
was
sure
of
and
that
was
that
he
did
not
resemble
the
picture
of
him
she
cherished
in
her
heart
both
his
laughter
yesterday
and
his
severity
distressed
her
in
an
equal
degree
her
pale
wandering
hero
could
never
have
laughed
like
that
and
such
an
expletive
as
swinish
lot
would
certainly
not
have
come
from
his
lips
a
dull
sense
of
disappointment
slowly
i
overcame
her
and
heightened
her
fear
of
him
and
while
she
skirted
the
dewy
plantation
she
saw
him
in
the
far
distance
galloping
over
the
fields
on
her
mare
one
minute
he
flashed
in
view
like
a
brilliant
phantom
the
next
he
was
hidden
behind
the
sheaves
schumann
the
head
bailiff
followed
him
on
his
roan
at
a
respectful
distance
horse
and
rider
resembled
each
other
they
both
looked
discomfited
and
dejected
now
and
then
leo
beckoned
him
to
his
side
as
if
demanding
an
account
of
something
then
he
would
leave
him
contemptuously
behind
again
hertha
fancied
she
could
see
the
way
in
which
the
fellow
with
the
sandy
beard
let
the
wrath
of
the
returned
master
pour
down
on
him
she
stood
on
tiptoe
and
craned
her
neck
fury
overwhelmed
her
too
when
some
specially
disgraceful
piece
of
neglect
came
under
surveillance
she
whistled
between
her
closed
teeth
and
flourished
her
fist
in
the
air
as
if
she
held
a
as
she
did
not
wish
to
encounter
him
at
any
price
she
took
a
sharp
turn
to
the
left
towards
an
enclosed
where
some
young
cattle
were
grazing
there
she
could
hide
till
he
had
gone
by
she
had
her
favourites
amongst
this
humble
herd
too
and
they
used
to
come
and
thrust
their
muzzles
on
her
shoulder
to
be
caressed
she
rubbed
their
woolly
foreheads
now
thinking
of
but
one
thing
all
the
time
he
is
here
then
suddenly
she
heard
him
coming
she
started
and
then
crouched
down
behind
a
stumpy
bush
the
mare
champed
under
the
stinging
pressure
of
the
curb
it
walked
as
if
it
were
stepping
on
glass
my
poor
animal
you
are
having
a
bad
time
of
it
thought
hertha
and
then
she
looked
at
him
the
peaked
cap
pushed
back
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
his
brow
pouring
with
perspiration
the
veins
standing
out
in
knots
on
his
temples
his
glance
stern
thus
he
rode
up
to
the
fence
a
tyrant
every
inch
of
him
hertha
did
not
see
the
fair
glossy
beard
the
erect
figure
and
graceful
seat
or
any
of
the
things
which
maidens
are
accustomed
to
take
notice
of
in
their
cavaliers
she
was
too
overcome
by
a
paralyzing
fear
and
growing
defiance
of
one
who
was
to
be
a
greater
power
than
herself
he
drew
rein
and
the
tightly
curbed
horse
shied
at
the
wooden
fence
what
have
we
got
there
he
inquired
in
a
grim
voice
of
command
hertha
began
to
tremble
had
his
angry
eyes
discovered
her
behind
the
bushes
was
he
going
to
treat
her
as
a
common
trespasser
on
his
property
but
his
question
concerned
the
bailiff
who
came
riding
to
his
side
bullocks
head
he
reported
with
quite
military
precision
how
old
the
youngest
one
year
the
oldest
a
year
and
six
months
and
they
have
been
left
out
on
the
marsh
schumann
muttered
a
crushed
yes
confounded
mismanagement
and
he
rode
on
he
right
thought
hertha
but
she
could
no
longer
muster
up
a
feeling
of
complete
triumph
the
sounded
and
hesitatingly
she
turned
her
steps
towards
the
house
let
what
may
happen
she
said
to
herself
he
wo
eat
me
and
so
she
entered
the
bravely
and
full
of
good
intentions
a
silent
group
was
gathered
there
he
sat
in
the
master
place
with
his
head
bowed
in
his
hands
his
morning
paper
spread
out
on
the
table
he
was
not
reading
it
but
gazing
before
him
lost
in
thought
elly
in
white
nainsook
and
blue
ribbons
like
a
may
queen
thought
hertha
jealously
had
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
wore
an
indescribably
dashed
expression
grandmamma
with
sighs
was
brewing
the
coffee
mamma
was
not
there
grandmamma
came
to
meet
her
took
her
by
the
hand
and
said
here
is
hertha
leo
dear
there
was
a
slight
reproach
in
her
voice
as
she
said
this
which
please
hertha
at
all
he
gave
her
a
quick
glance
which
measured
her
from
head
to
toe
and
his
face
brightened
a
little
he
got
up
lazily
and
held
out
his
hand
i
hope
that
you
are
happy
here
my
dear
hertha
he
said
so
i
am
to
be
graciously
patronized
she
thought
with
increasing
bitterness
as
she
laid
her
hand
silently
in
his
she
had
seldom
felt
so
conscious
of
being
an
orphan
as
at
this
minute
you
have
a
good
firm
handshake
he
went
on
smiling
i
believe
we
shall
be
friends
she
felt
she
was
blushing
and
wished
earnestly
that
she
could
think
of
some
smart
retort
but
nothing
occurred
to
her
and
now
let
us
be
jolly
children
he
exclaimed
clapping
his
hands
it
no
use
wearing
one
self
out
with
worrying
here
you
whitewashed
one
give
me
some
coffee
elly
pouted
and
hertha
thought
ha
ha
she
caught
it
but
her
turn
came
next
well
little
girl
he
went
on
leaning
back
in
his
chair
mother
tells
me
wonderful
things
about
you
you
do
the
work
of
a
bailiff
of
a
housewife
you
mean
she
replied
and
then
blushed
deeply
for
she
felt
that
she
had
said
something
silly
oh
indeed
he
laughed
and
shook
his
finger
at
her
not
quite
so
far
as
that
yet
you
are
not
in
such
a
hurry
to
become
housewives
are
you
children
hertha
drew
herself
rigidly
erect
her
lips
trembled
with
anger
i
like
work
she
said
and
people
who
scoff
at
it
are
those
who
have
forgotten
the
way
to
work
he
put
down
his
which
had
been
halfway
to
his
mouth
in
sheer
amazement
and
stared
at
her
silently
for
a
moment
then
he
said
upon
my
soul
you
seem
to
be
a
snappish
little
lady
i
must
take
care
in
future
grandmamma
now
came
to
the
rescue
anxiously
she
took
the
girl
head
between
her
dear
old
hands
she
does
mean
it
she
said
and
smoothed
her
over
eyes
and
mouth
as
if
she
would
fain
have
wiped
out
the
naughty
speech
hertha
was
sorry
with
a
feeling
of
dull
regret
but
she
would
rather
have
bitten
her
tongue
out
than
let
a
word
of
apology
pass
her
lips
conversation
did
not
flow
easily
again
and
hertha
before
she
had
emptied
her
second
cup
of
coffee
ran
off
as
if
she
were
a
hunted
animal
when
she
reached
her
room
everything
seemed
to
swim
before
her
in
a
damp
mist
she
went
to
her
glass
and
said
to
herself
i
really
did
mean
to
be
rude
elly
came
after
her
she
scarcely
knew
at
first
what
to
say
as
she
stood
there
in
her
finery
looking
so
round
and
pretty
with
her
pink
cheeks
and
innocent
blue
eyes
at
last
she
said
you
were
simply
odious
i
could
never
have
been
so
odious
and
she
glanced
down
lovingly
at
her
ribbon
bows
vi
leo
stayed
alone
with
his
mother
the
morning
sunlight
danced
on
the
coffee
table
snowy
damask
the
silver
kettle
hummed
and
hissed
and
the
smoke
from
leo
cigar
rose
lightly
in
transparent
rings
to
the
ceiling
i
do
know
how
it
is
said
the
old
lady
sighing
and
stroking
back
the
wavy
grey
hair
from
her
forehead
it
may
be
wrong
of
me
but
i
ca
be
as
happy
this
morning
as
i
ought
to
be
first
it
is
one
thing
and
then
another
never
mind
little
mother
he
said
it
will
soon
be
all
right
my
goods
have
certainly
been
squandered
no
no
i
do
blame
you
for
it
if
any
one
to
blame
i
am
what
did
i
keep
away
so
long
for
ulrich
wrote
strongly
enough
but
i
was
an
ass
and
would
not
heed
there
time
yet
thank
god
i
have
not
unlearnt
the
way
to
work
as
that
shrewish
little
girl
hinted
just
now
you
are
unjust
to
her
the
mother
said
defending
hertha
hotly
one
should
not
take
everything
young
girls
say
too
literally
you
should
look
into
their
hearts
instead
and
this
young
heart
leo
i
know
for
a
fact
is
full
of
you
you
alone
and
no
other
how
do
i
come
to
be
so
honoured
he
asked
with
a
laugh
she
made
an
arch
grimace
and
laid
her
hand
caressingly
on
his
you
know
what
her
position
is
when
johanna
husband
died
i
want
to
say
anything
against
him
his
soul
may
rest
in
peace
but
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
leo
interrupted
but
i
must
say
that
i
should
like
to
get
a
glimpse
of
johanna
herself
his
mother
appeared
distressed
and
painfully
moved
wait
a
little
longer
she
said
hesitatingly
she
will
come
down
soon
now
then
out
with
it
he
commanded
directly
i
ask
after
her
you
evade
the
question
ulrich
too
threw
out
hints
and
she
herself
is
avoiding
me
the
matter
must
be
cleared
up
instantly
she
avoids
everybody
complained
his
mother
with
tears
in
her
eyes
johanna
is
quite
altered
you
would
scarcely
know
her
i
should
never
have
thought
it
possible
any
nature
could
have
become
so
gloomy
you
know
my
dear
boy
that
i
am
not
irreligious
myself
i
believe
in
god
and
the
lord
jesus
and
that
i
shall
meet
your
father
again
in
an
eternal
world
most
firmly
do
i
believe
it
yes
mother
dear
i
know
you
do
leo
answered
bending
his
lips
over
her
hand
a
joyousness
dwelt
in
her
simple
heart
which
kept
all
doubt
miles
away
but
you
see
she
went
on
johanna
goes
to
an
extreme
which
makes
one
almost
anxious
she
has
had
an
altar
put
up
by
her
bed
and
a
marble
crucifix
hangs
on
the
wall
as
if
she
were
a
catholic
i
have
found
her
before
it
often
fallen
asleep
in
her
clothes
when
i
have
gone
into
her
room
in
the
morning
she
has
given
up
all
society
she
does
come
down
when
there
are
guests
here
and
we
ourselves
often
do
see
her
all
day
long
then
she
has
started
a
school
for
infants
old
lange
is
getting
feeble
so
it
relieves
him
she
sings
and
prays
with
the
little
ones
and
in
winter
she
makes
soup
for
them
and
that
is
the
only
intercourse
she
has
with
any
one
how
long
has
this
been
going
on
he
asked
frowning
it
is
nearly
two
years
now
his
mother
answered
yes
it
was
when
the
girls
left
school
and
came
home
i
sent
elly
there
because
it
was
hertha
school
and
i
wanted
the
girls
to
become
friends
and
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
have
hertha
in
the
house
to
make
her
home
with
us
why
have
you
taken
up
this
hertha
he
asked
your
interest
in
the
girl
seems
to
me
rather
suspicious
the
old
lady
flushed
like
a
maiden
of
sixteen
and
as
she
looked
up
at
him
with
her
merry
eyes
full
of
truth
and
candour
she
said
almost
apologetically
leo
dear
you
know
no
really
i
do
he
answered
laughing
then
she
began
to
divulge
her
plans
to
him
in
detail
hertha
maternal
fortune
was
enormous
not
by
any
means
to
be
underrated
and
there
was
only
one
drawback
to
the
property
she
owned
and
that
was
its
being
in
poland
her
mother
before
her
marriage
had
fallen
out
with
the
family
and
had
to
go
to
law
with
her
own
brother
for
her
possessions
through
that
all
intercourse
between
hertha
and
her
polish
relations
had
been
cut
off
the
only
person
to
be
consulted
on
the
bestowal
of
her
hand
was
her
guardian
the
old
judge
wessel
i
have
never
met
the
old
gentleman
she
continued
but
we
write
to
each
other
twice
a
year
the
most
friendly
letters
so
there
is
nothing
to
fear
from
that
quarter
i
assure
you
leo
that
you
have
only
to
raise
your
little
finger
and
the
richest
heiress
in
the
country
will
be
your
wife
she
paused
triumphantly
but
instead
of
answering
he
whistled
his
favourite
mexican
air
paloma
and
smiled
into
vacancy
his
mother
was
hurt
i
have
taken
so
much
trouble
to
arrange
it
she
said
it
has
cost
me
thousands
of
sleepless
nights
and
you
do
even
repay
me
with
you
it
takes
two
people
to
make
a
marriage
my
mother
he
replied
i
am
an
elderly
i
have
been
a
vagabond
absentee
landlord
and
i
am
packed
full
of
sins
up
to
my
throat
and
she
she
is
a
child
next
spring
she
will
be
seventeen
was
the
answer
well
then
i
say
you
he
said
standing
up
and
when
i
am
out
of
the
hole
i
am
in
at
present
we
will
perhaps
return
to
the
subject
the
mother
strongly
objected
he
would
thus
give
her
time
to
lose
her
heart
to
some
foolish
youth
who
would
fill
her
head
with
nonsense
had
she
not
been
specially
designed
for
him
did
she
rave
about
him
and
dream
about
him
before
she
had
even
seen
him
was
she
now
that
he
had
come
back
to
be
repulsed
and
slighted
but
perhaps
she
does
attract
you
she
went
on
in
an
anxious
tone
or
there
is
some
one
else
some
one
you
have
fallen
in
love
with
away
or
even
secretly
married
are
you
going
to
bring
a
creole
here
as
your
wife
or
one
of
those
ladies
who
knock
about
the
world
in
search
of
adventures
i
tell
you
leo
that
if
you
do
i
shall
take
to
my
bed
and
die
he
did
his
best
to
reassure
her
he
had
come
home
as
free
as
when
he
went
away
and
had
done
once
for
all
with
affairs
of
the
heart
she
wiped
her
eyes
but
the
tears
would
well
forth
afresh
oh
my
boy
my
boy
she
sobbed
and
stroked
his
hand
with
trembling
fingers
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
gently
but
he
knew
well
enough
since
the
day
he
received
his
sentence
he
had
not
seen
her
face
to
face
and
in
this
moment
her
mother
heart
was
living
through
again
the
world
of
sorrow
which
her
son
wildness
had
once
created
for
her
stop
crying
mother
he
implored
ah
what
have
i
not
suffered
for
your
sake
she
wailed
why
did
you
go
and
shoot
rhaden
dead
rhaden
who
was
an
intimate
friends
of
ours
and
felicitas
husband
besides
so
a
kind
of
relation
he
reminded
her
that
it
was
rhaden
and
no
other
who
had
challenged
him
but
could
you
have
shot
in
the
air
she
inquired
it
is
so
often
done
you
do
understand
dear
he
answered
if
i
had
been
brought
home
dead
you
would
have
had
even
a
greater
trial
to
bear
on
my
account
rhaden
you
know
never
jested
she
knew
indeed
that
his
aim
was
unerring
and
realised
for
the
first
time
the
danger
which
had
hovered
over
her
son
she
patted
his
cheeks
full
of
anxiety
as
if
even
she
might
be
robbed
of
him
you
are
right
you
are
right
she
murmured
i
told
felicitas
so
when
she
accepted
him
he
was
always
a
cruel
revengeful
character
do
abuse
him
mother
he
said
seriously
he
is
dead
and
when
we
have
had
it
out
once
for
all
let
us
leave
this
ugly
story
alone
for
ever
it
has
cost
every
one
concerned
a
good
slice
of
their
happiness
it
is
time
that
we
buried
it
she
wiped
the
tears
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
and
looked
once
more
placid
content
i
may
talk
of
felicitas
i
suppose
she
asked
why
not
he
said
undecidedly
and
examined
his
what
do
you
think
of
that
marriage
she
broke
forth
fancy
uli
who
would
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
well
why
should
he
marry
but
it
was
so
extraordinary
he
your
best
friend
he
has
my
blessing
leo
spoke
abruptly
and
was
in
haste
to
get
on
to
another
topic
how
comes
it
he
asked
that
your
intercourse
with
felicitas
is
entirely
over
my
my
misfortune
with
rhaden
was
not
the
reason
oh
no
not
in
the
least
she
replied
when
you
were
gone
we
associated
the
same
as
before
for
we
said
to
ourselves
that
we
poor
women
ought
to
suffer
more
than
was
necessary
for
the
men
sake
it
told
upon
us
all
heavily
i
wo
speak
of
myself
johanna
appeared
in
deep
mourning
for
she
had
just
buried
her
husband
lizzie
was
so
desolate
and
in
need
of
help
and
so
we
comforted
each
other
it
was
not
till
lizzie
engagement
to
ulrich
began
to
be
talked
about
that
there
was
an
estrangement
i
do
know
exactly
why
for
we
all
congratulated
her
but
just
before
the
wedding
she
and
johanna
quarrelled
the
reason
has
never
come
out
for
you
know
how
johanna
can
be
as
silent
as
the
grave
the
day
it
happened
felicitas
drove
away
deadly
pale
without
saying
and
has
never
been
here
since
johanna
vowed
that
she
would
rather
die
than
go
to
the
wedding
and
prayed
me
not
to
go
and
when
any
one
begs
me
not
to
do
a
thing
well
you
know
yes
i
know
mummy
he
said
and
caressed
her
hair
compassionately
she
had
always
given
in
to
his
sister
there
was
silence
he
bit
at
the
ends
of
his
beard
and
meditated
oh
rubbish
he
exclaimed
on
a
sudden
and
jumped
to
his
feet
be
courageous
and
repent
nothing
that
is
the
whole
secret
of
life
what
do
you
mean
my
son
his
mother
asked
nervously
for
answer
he
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
seized
his
cap
but
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
figure
dressed
in
unrelieved
black
stood
on
the
threshold
he
glanced
at
her
quickly
then
recoiled
could
this
be
johanna
her
beauty
her
youth
what
had
become
of
them
motionless
and
without
showing
a
sign
of
pleasure
she
stood
before
him
and
did
not
even
stretch
out
her
hand
to
him
johanna
he
cried
and
was
going
to
embrace
her
but
she
only
offered
him
her
forehead
to
kiss
slowly
and
unwillingly
as
if
performing
a
great
sacrifice
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
shuddered
under
the
touch
of
his
lips
this
was
the
reception
his
pet
sister
his
childhood
companion
chose
to
give
him
after
a
separation
of
six
years
he
tried
with
his
ready
humour
to
master
the
situation
i
have
gone
through
a
lot
hannah
since
i
saw
you
last
he
said
laughing
i
have
been
received
in
various
odd
ways
in
different
parts
of
the
globe
with
bullets
with
poisoned
arrows
with
rotten
eggs
with
sour
mare
milk
and
i
do
know
what
else
but
such
a
welcome
as
this
is
altogether
novel
in
my
experience
her
melancholy
eyes
sunk
deeply
in
her
thin
haggard
face
gazed
at
him
gloomily
and
searchingly
you
have
been
away
a
long
time
she
said
and
sat
down
yes
that
is
true
and
you
have
kept
your
splendid
health
and
spirits
yes
i
have
kept
in
capital
health
thank
you
there
was
a
pause
he
regarded
her
more
and
more
as
a
stranger
a
grim
inscrutable
stoniness
seemed
to
have
frozen
her
nature
she
had
evidently
nursed
and
cultivated
an
old
grief
with
an
egoism
that
had
become
fanatical
and
then
as
he
recalled
all
the
vanished
splendour
of
her
beauty
and
looked
at
the
emaciated
throat
and
angular
shoulders
which
made
the
flatness
of
her
bust
the
more
apparent
pity
and
his
old
love
for
her
gained
the
upper
hand
what
must
she
have
suffered
to
have
so
changed
in
appearance
we
ca
go
on
like
this
hannah
he
said
if
i
have
done
anything
to
displease
you
speak
out
and
let
us
make
it
up
for
a
moment
a
kindlier
glance
shot
from
her
eyes
but
he
fancied
it
meant
that
she
pitied
him
and
so
he
was
not
reassured
however
he
did
not
wish
to
rely
on
conjecture
he
would
try
and
put
things
on
the
old
hearty
footing
between
them
look
here
he
said
it
is
plain
that
your
soul
is
cherishing
some
old
grudge
you
and
i
always
held
to
one
another
ca
you
feel
the
old
confidence
in
me
again
tell
me
what
your
trouble
is
and
see
if
i
ca
heal
the
wound
it
seems
to
me
that
you
stand
in
greater
need
of
healing
than
i
do
she
answered
without
taking
her
eyes
off
him
how
so
he
asked
and
plunged
his
hands
into
his
stretching
his
legs
wide
apart
as
he
planted
himself
in
front
of
her
i
have
often
asked
myself
leo
what
sort
of
man
you
would
come
back
i
hoped
you
might
appear
before
us
serious
and
subdued
a
little
burdened
by
the
consciousness
of
what
you
had
brought
upon
yourself
and
us
often
enough
i
have
prayed
god
that
it
might
be
so
but
instead
you
are
are
aye
what
you
are
any
one
can
see
with
half
an
eye
well
what
am
i
he
asked
hardening
into
an
attitude
of
scoffing
amusement
i
can
only
hope
for
your
own
sake
she
went
on
that
your
conduct
is
not
real
but
a
mask
that
behind
there
is
something
more
than
one
would
suppose
from
your
plump
happy
face
but
if
you
are
not
acting
and
deceiving
us
if
in
reality
you
are
so
thoroughly
satisfied
with
yourself
then
dear
leo
it
would
have
been
better
if
our
mother
had
never
borne
you
but
johanna
their
mother
exclaimed
running
between
them
in
horror
leave
her
alone
mummy
he
said
you
see
she
is
you
prepared
me
for
it
yourself
have
patience
with
her
the
mother
entreated
softly
i
have
have
i
he
laughed
if
i
had
learnt
by
this
time
to
put
up
with
a
few
feminine
vagaries
i
should
indeed
be
incorrigible
i
am
not
so
and
when
you
choose
my
dear
sister
to
adopt
a
more
reasonable
tone
towards
me
we
shall
be
friends
again
does
that
suit
you
eh
she
looked
at
him
and
did
not
speak
he
flung
out
of
the
room
and
the
door
banged
behind
him
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
outer
hall
and
drew
a
deep
breath
his
immovable
glance
had
oppressed
him
like
a
nightmare
a
vague
suspicion
began
to
dawn
within
him
but
he
struggled
against
it
now
for
work
he
exclaimed
and
he
shook
his
fists
in
the
air
vii
the
worst
of
it
all
was
that
the
crops
were
ripe
for
harvest
but
could
not
be
cut
because
there
were
not
enough
hands
for
the
labour
uncle
kutowski
whom
leo
wanted
to
call
to
account
for
this
was
nowhere
to
be
found
he
had
not
been
seen
since
early
morning
when
he
had
driven
off
in
his
chaise
leo
learnt
how
matters
stood
from
schumann
who
was
officiously
obliging
in
giving
information
the
old
man
it
would
seem
was
in
the
habit
of
levying
fines
which
added
not
a
little
to
his
salary
so
that
the
foreign
reapers
who
let
themselves
out
on
hire
in
gangs
long
before
the
beginning
of
the
harvest
had
been
so
exasperated
by
deductions
made
on
their
wages
that
last
they
had
packed
their
bundles
and
decamped
in
the
night
the
home
who
were
available
were
not
capable
of
the
work
and
so
it
had
been
at
a
standstill
for
eight
days
half
the
crops
were
likely
to
be
ruined
in
consequence
but
the
old
steward
felt
no
qualms
on
that
score
and
did
not
let
the
prospect
of
a
spoilt
harvest
weigh
on
his
mind
this
alone
was
enough
to
give
leo
an
insight
into
what
sort
of
hands
the
management
of
his
property
had
fallen
for
the
last
four
years
he
would
have
liked
to
his
uncle
and
send
him
packing
without
further
parley
but
unfortunately
those
who
have
been
accomplices
in
our
past
sins
have
to
be
gently
dealt
with
lest
they
betray
secrets
he
recognized
the
fact
in
wrath
and
shame
that
he
had
put
himself
to
a
great
extent
at
the
mercy
of
the
old
reprobate
nevertheless
bold
and
resolute
action
might
yet
set
him
free
he
gave
orders
at
the
gatehouse
that
herr
kutowski
was
to
be
sent
to
him
so
soon
as
he
should
show
his
face
in
the
yard
again
then
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
study
here
everything
was
the
same
as
of
old
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
there
stood
an
ancestral
bequest
in
the
shape
of
a
huge
escritoire
finely
carved
with
inlaid
drawers
where
many
secrets
lay
hid
the
walls
were
decorated
with
groups
of
pistols
sporting
weapons
and
surrounded
artistically
with
antlers
tusks
and
discs
trophies
of
boyish
sportsmanship
which
once
he
had
regarded
with
reverence
but
which
now
hardly
won
a
smile
from
him
many
an
idle
hour
had
he
lounged
away
at
one
time
of
his
life
on
the
old
couch
by
the
door
with
its
slippery
shabby
leather
covering
and
dreamed
of
forbidden
things
over
there
were
photographs
of
his
nearest
and
dearest
ones
mamma
with
a
lace
tippet
over
her
bodice
papa
with
epaulets
and
a
whiskers
pastor
brenckenberg
before
he
had
grown
puffy
and
bloated
when
he
had
lived
in
the
house
as
tutor
and
ruled
him
with
the
cane
then
there
was
johanna
before
she
did
up
her
hair
with
white
worsted
stockings
gleaming
beneath
her
short
skirts
ulrich
as
an
upper
boy
as
a
with
long
hair
and
by
him
strange
coincidence
felicitas
in
budding
maidenhood
with
masses
of
curly
hair
and
a
languishing
smile
the
picture
dated
from
the
days
when
as
distant
cousin
she
had
come
to
stay
at
halewitz
and
when
he
had
fallen
head
over
ears
in
love
with
her
ulrich
had
followed
his
example
and
johanna
had
been
annoyed
he
grasped
his
brow
was
it
all
a
dream
a
shudder
ran
through
him
he
who
had
once
believed
himself
to
be
master
of
his
fate
saw
himself
tossed
like
a
cork
on
the
waves
and
now
in
sport
cast
up
on
the
shore
breathing
hard
he
set
to
work
on
the
accounts
hours
went
by
he
sat
bowed
over
the
ledgers
adding
up
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
added
up
right
it
was
worse
than
he
feared
shock
followed
shock
but
none
was
pleasant
and
in
the
midst
of
his
reckoning
a
sudden
burning
blush
of
shame
flooded
his
face
he
read
sent
to
monte
carlo
marks
and
a
few
lines
further
on
to
monte
carlo
marks
how
could
he
reproach
others
when
he
himself
had
been
a
mere
common
gambler
was
it
not
natural
that
every
man
should
try
to
grab
his
share
out
of
the
universal
bankruptcy
but
he
felt
that
in
this
memorandum
it
was
not
so
much
his
wretched
property
as
his
honour
and
peace
of
mind
that
was
most
at
stake
it
was
for
this
he
was
determined
to
fight
the
old
scoundrel
for
a
moment
he
let
his
eye
linger
on
the
opposite
wall
where
the
arms
hung
and
then
he
started
on
the
figures
again
the
affair
seemed
to
grow
ever
more
and
more
complicated
it
was
almost
inconceivable
that
with
expenditure
always
on
the
increase
and
ever
shrinking
profits
a
balance
could
be
maintained
the
sequestrator
must
have
been
at
home
here
for
a
long
time
he
muttered
altogether
the
actual
accounts
were
in
order
who
could
wonder
everywhere
amongst
the
uncle
beautiful
clear
signature
proved
how
religiously
his
friend
had
performed
his
weekly
duties
as
auditor
only
on
the
margin
was
entered
here
and
there
a
certain
mysterious
sum
of
money
unendorsed
and
specified
among
the
receipts
as
interest
called
in
by
herr
baron
von
kletzingk
it
ran
each
time
to
several
thousand
marks
and
the
total
would
have
been
a
fortune
when
did
i
ever
lend
money
on
interest
cried
leo
striking
his
forehead
on
which
started
great
beads
of
anxious
sweat
and
the
further
he
proceeded
the
oftener
with
uncanny
regularity
did
the
sum
stare
him
in
the
face
it
invariably
occurred
at
a
convenient
juncture
to
cover
some
heavy
outlay
or
to
help
meet
a
bill
it
presided
over
the
columns
as
a
ex
a
blessing
and
friend
in
need
the
one
person
who
could
have
thrown
light
on
the
bewildering
problem
was
uncle
kutowski
who
still
made
himself
scarce
if
he
owns
up
leo
concluded
i
will
let
him
off
lightly
if
not
it
will
be
life
or
death
towards
five
the
old
gentleman
trap
drew
up
at
the
bailiff
house
he
was
lying
back
in
a
corner
tight
as
a
drum
sucking
the
end
of
his
cigar
old
christian
who
on
leo
behalf
had
been
on
the
for
him
helped
him
to
alight
and
informed
him
that
the
master
wished
to
speak
to
him
at
once
herr
kutowski
poured
out
a
volley
of
abuse
which
echoed
over
the
courtyard
what
has
the
youngster
taken
into
his
head
am
i
his
that
he
should
order
me
about
like
this
he
had
better
be
careful
teach
him
who
i
am
and
what
i
know
christian
greatly
scandalized
to
avert
a
further
outbreak
hurried
off
to
tell
his
master
of
the
steward
arrival
fortunately
no
one
had
been
near
to
overhear
his
disrespectful
words
uncle
kutowski
swaggered
with
jingling
spurs
into
his
apartments
to
indulge
in
a
siesta
he
surveyed
himself
in
the
cracked
shaving
mirror
which
satisfied
the
small
demands
of
his
vanity
and
had
a
long
conversation
with
himself
from
which
it
might
have
been
gathered
that
he
wished
to
be
regarded
as
the
lawful
possessor
of
halewitz
then
he
cleared
off
the
remains
of
a
which
lay
on
the
table
with
some
blacking
a
dirty
pack
of
french
cards
a
filled
with
tobacco
and
a
pig
bladder
he
kicked
a
couple
of
empty
off
the
sofa
which
creaked
at
every
touch
like
a
hungry
crow
and
was
just
going
to
fling
himself
on
the
horsehair
cushions
when
the
door
opened
and
leo
walked
into
the
room
it
the
custom
for
people
to
knock
before
they
come
in
here
my
boy
the
old
man
screamed
in
greeting
remember
that
in
future
leo
made
no
response
but
calmly
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
then
put
it
in
his
pocket
now
uncle
said
he
we
will
have
a
talk
there
was
a
certain
friendly
decision
in
his
manner
which
did
not
impress
the
old
man
pleasantly
still
he
was
going
to
show
that
he
had
not
drunk
himself
into
a
courageous
frame
of
mind
for
nothing
quite
right
my
dear
boy
he
said
leaning
back
with
a
lofty
air
you
have
come
to
apologise
to
your
old
uncle
which
is
only
what
i
should
have
expected
of
you
considering
how
we
are
related
to
one
another
i
wish
to
remind
you
my
dear
uncle
said
leo
that
at
the
present
moment
you
are
still
in
my
service
eh
what
service
sneered
the
old
man
i
spit
at
your
service
and
he
spat
i
am
not
asking
you
why
on
my
first
day
at
home
you
have
taken
the
first
opportunity
of
getting
drunk
because
i
think
i
pretty
well
understand
your
temperament
i
ask
you
only
whether
you
would
rather
sleep
it
off
first
or
whether
you
feel
in
a
position
to
answer
my
questions
straight
away
what
do
you
mean
by
in
a
position
the
old
fellow
snarled
i
am
in
a
position
to
answer
anything
that
is
to
say
if
i
choose
very
well
then
said
leo
in
that
case
i
am
here
as
your
master
and
i
must
request
you
to
stand
before
me
what
what
i
stand
get
up
said
leo
and
lifting
the
sofa
in
the
air
he
shook
the
old
man
off
it
as
if
he
were
shaking
a
cat
out
of
a
then
he
gave
the
piece
of
furniture
a
mighty
kick
and
with
a
grinding
sound
it
fell
to
pieces
the
old
man
reeled
against
the
table
and
gave
leo
the
crafty
savage
look
of
a
wild
boar
at
bay
i
remember
this
of
you
he
growled
i
quite
see
leo
went
on
that
it
is
useless
to
try
and
get
you
to
render
me
an
account
of
my
financial
affairs
and
that
is
not
what
i
have
come
about
it
is
true
that
you
have
succeeded
in
playing
the
deuce
with
a
large
amount
of
my
property
and
the
rest
i
shall
have
to
put
in
order
myself
to
the
best
of
my
ability
schumann
and
the
accountant
will
explain
the
details
to
me
this
much
i
have
already
ascertained
that
if
i
thought
it
necessary
i
should
have
abundance
of
material
with
which
to
put
schuster
on
your
track
better
and
better
the
old
man
said
with
a
laugh
of
scorn
and
began
to
toy
with
the
pig
bladder
but
do
think
for
a
moment
leo
continued
that
i
intend
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
not
that
the
relationship
between
us
counts
for
anything
you
could
not
very
well
bring
more
disgrace
on
my
house
than
you
have
done
during
the
last
four
years
neither
would
the
recollection
of
our
old
friendship
deter
me
i
have
had
to
pay
dearly
enough
for
it
no
i
have
another
reason
for
coming
here
so
it
seems
scoffed
his
uncle
look
here
old
man
since
we
met
last
night
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
been
trying
to
intimate
by
various
hints
that
you
hold
me
in
the
hollow
of
your
hand
that
you
have
only
to
open
your
mouth
to
bring
me
to
utter
ruin
and
i
do
know
what
besides
well
you
are
mistaken
dear
uncle
you
think
probably
that
you
have
still
the
foolish
dissolute
youth
to
deal
with
who
was
once
weak
enough
to
let
you
lead
him
into
all
sorts
of
disreputable
scrapes
you
have
the
slightest
idea
who
it
is
stands
before
you
now
do
you
know
uncle
what
a
desperado
is
it
is
a
man
who
has
learnt
the
greatest
wisdom
in
life
which
is
that
there
nothing
in
the
world
he
need
lose
so
long
as
he
does
use
feeble
means
to
get
it
but
instead
stakes
life
and
death
on
what
he
wants
even
if
the
thing
be
nothing
bigger
than
a
such
a
desperado
i
have
come
back
to
you
my
dear
uncle
and
if
you
do
stop
your
damned
grinning
at
once
i
strike
you
down
like
a
dog
he
raised
his
clenched
fist
which
for
a
few
seconds
waved
like
a
swinging
axe
over
the
old
man
stubby
head
his
last
sneer
choked
in
his
throat
and
he
took
a
step
backwards
and
crouched
in
terror
against
the
wall
then
with
a
laugh
leo
stuck
his
hand
in
his
pocket
that
a
sample
for
you
uncle
he
said
people
shall
do
what
i
will
have
them
do
or
go
to
the
devil
and
now
listen
again
when
i
decided
to
come
home
i
knew
perfectly
well
what
a
kettle
of
fish
i
should
find
and
then
i
looked
at
my
pistols
i
have
a
splendid
pair
of
pistols
uncle
dear
but
i
have
got
them
here
because
just
at
present
i
do
need
them
to
take
aim
at
you
and
i
said
to
myself
these
beggars
have
helped
me
out
of
many
a
tight
corner
where
life
and
death
were
the
stakes
why
should
i
let
them
rust
in
old
europe
when
the
same
will
be
for
the
most
part
nothing
but
a
you
are
a
uncle
nothing
more
or
less
do
be
offended
all
i
insist
on
is
that
you
hold
your
tongue
i
will
have
that
cursed
intrigue
you
know
which
buried
for
ever
and
ever
should
it
come
to
light
should
i
hear
the
slightest
indication
that
you
have
breathed
a
word
of
what
you
know
then
i
shall
take
out
one
of
my
beautiful
pistols
and
blow
you
into
the
skies
do
you
believe
me
do
joke
stuttered
the
old
man
and
squinted
towards
the
door
you
need
be
frightened
my
dear
little
uncle
leo
laughed
i
told
you
that
i
had
got
them
with
me
they
are
not
necessary
yet
this
is
only
a
preliminary
warning
when
i
want
you
i
shall
find
you
no
matter
where
you
may
be
i
should
take
a
heathenish
joy
in
hunting
you
down
we
learn
that
sort
of
sport
on
the
other
side
uncle
do
you
believe
me
the
old
steward
cringed
further
backwards
and
clinging
to
the
struggled
to
speak
how
can
you
treat
me
like
this
he
burst
forth
in
utterance
i
would
go
through
fire
and
water
for
you
i
would
have
cut
off
my
right
hand
for
you
and
you
shake
your
fist
at
me
and
threaten
me
with
and
all
the
rest
of
it
only
for
a
certain
emergency
you
know
leo
interposed
such
suspicion
went
on
the
old
man
such
want
of
confidence
i
have
kept
as
silent
as
the
grave
i
would
rather
have
bitten
my
tongue
out
than
said
anything
i
have
been
plagued
and
racked
by
conscience
all
these
years
and
this
is
my
reward
this
is
my
reward
in
utter
helplessness
he
began
to
cry
like
a
baby
leo
waited
till
his
grief
had
subsided
and
then
gave
his
commands
by
that
evening
he
was
to
have
left
the
castle
and
the
neighbourhood
by
the
next
morning
in
case
he
should
cherish
and
in
consideration
of
his
being
a
relation
a
month
salary
should
be
paid
him
at
some
place
over
the
frontier
it
was
not
certain
where
probably
either
at
warsaw
or
wilna
so
that
he
might
lead
a
decent
life
the
old
man
said
thank
you
humbly
and
grovelled
when
shall
the
carriage
be
ready
uncle
asked
leo
opening
the
door
uncle
kutowski
said
that
he
had
only
to
pack
and
to
bid
the
ladies
farewell
but
if
he
might
be
allowed
he
should
like
to
take
a
little
nap
before
his
departure
sleep
away
then
old
sinner
said
leo
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
and
as
his
uncle
seemed
unable
to
move
from
the
spot
either
from
emotion
or
fright
he
took
him
by
the
arm
and
led
him
with
gentle
care
to
his
bed
where
he
covered
him
up
with
his
cloak
which
hung
near
on
the
wall
then
he
went
his
way
whistling
paloma
before
he
sat
down
to
his
again
he
ordered
christian
to
bring
up
a
bottle
of
the
oldest
wine
in
honour
of
the
day
and
as
he
poured
out
the
first
glass
and
held
it
toward
the
youthful
likeness
of
his
friend
he
said
between
his
clenched
teeth
long
live
little
girl
it
has
saved
both
you
and
i
from
a
catastrophe
the
same
evening
the
arrival
of
the
carriage
from
uhlenfelde
was
announced
he
had
not
expected
a
visit
from
his
friend
so
soon
and
a
thrill
of
joy
and
at
the
same
time
of
alarm
ran
through
him
the
visitor
clasped
his
hand
with
the
old
genial
pressure
which
dispelled
at
once
the
anxious
presentiment
of
a
moment
before
but
the
pale
face
wore
an
excited
expression
and
the
sunset
glow
which
came
through
the
windows
was
reflected
in
the
feverish
glitter
of
his
tired
eyes
you
are
not
well
said
leo
who
read
on
the
familiar
features
the
story
of
recent
mental
excitement
that
felicitas
had
something
to
do
with
it
and
his
own
homecoming
it
was
not
difficult
to
guess
let
me
sit
down
quietly
for
a
few
minutes
ulrich
said
pressing
his
hand
against
his
left
side
i
shall
be
better
soon
he
refused
leo
offers
of
refreshment
and
with
short
hard
gasps
breathed
in
the
perfumed
evening
air
which
was
wafted
into
the
room
from
the
garden
when
leo
saw
him
leaning
back
in
his
old
accustomed
place
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
his
heart
bounded
how
often
they
had
sat
together
there
making
youthful
plans
while
the
grasshoppers
chirruped
outside
and
the
solemn
quavering
strains
of
a
concertina
sounded
from
the
stables
they
had
often
touched
on
the
subject
of
marriage
and
had
agreed
that
their
wives
must
be
two
bosom
friends
or
better
still
two
sisters
so
that
their
old
hearts
intimacy
should
not
be
sacrificed
nothing
seemed
changed
outwardly
the
grasshoppers
chirruped
the
concertina
began
timidly
as
if
uncertain
whether
it
might
dare
now
the
master
had
come
home
and
yet
everything
was
different
still
i
have
got
leo
soul
cried
aloud
and
i
will
not
let
him
slip
through
my
fingers
you
have
seen
how
things
are
now
with
your
own
eyes
ulrich
said
sitting
up
i
am
afraid
there
not
much
to
congratulate
you
upon
i
have
found
nothing
but
gross
negligence
leo
assented
if
i
may
venture
to
advise
you
i
should
get
rid
of
the
old
man
despite
considerations
of
kinship
and
friendship
at
all
events
he
is
much
use
to
you
i
have
kicked
him
out
already
said
leo
so
much
the
better
ulrich
remarked
one
of
his
worst
feats
was
last
saturday
when
his
chicanery
drove
away
the
lithuanian
reapers
i
am
quite
at
sea
in
that
matter
leo
declared
unless
a
miracle
happens
the
fine
harvest
will
go
to
the
dogs
not
quite
a
miracle
is
required
to
save
it
replied
ulrich
with
his
dear
old
smile
which
always
seemed
to
bring
comfort
and
help
a
few
days
ago
i
applied
to
captain
von
quetner
in
münsterberg
i
begged
aid
from
him
he
believed
he
could
meet
the
emergency
and
before
sunrise
men
uhlans
will
be
brought
over
here
on
my
waggons
a
wave
of
gladness
swept
over
leo
from
this
moment
things
would
look
up
he
seized
ulrich
hand
in
dumb
gratitude
but
the
latter
bit
his
lips
and
withdrew
from
him
gently
i
did
come
to
tell
you
this
he
said
i
could
have
written
about
that
but
there
are
things
to
be
discussed
that
can
not
be
committed
to
paper
i
am
sorry
to
say
your
prophecy
has
proved
true
it
must
be
all
over
between
you
and
me
a
woman
has
separated
us
my
marriage
has
demanded
the
sacrifice
of
our
friendship
leo
stared
at
him
unable
to
speak
do
misunderstand
me
ulrich
went
on
struggling
painfully
with
his
words
i
need
assure
you
that
i
love
you
as
much
as
i
ever
did
i
fear
that
this
separation
may
be
my
nevertheless
it
must
be
because
your
your
wife
desires
it
asked
leo
in
growing
bitterness
do
call
me
weak
and
abuse
me
for
being
a
slave
to
a
woman
ulrich
answered
i
have
never
in
all
my
life
been
tied
to
and
hope
i
never
shall
but
i
am
in
the
habit
of
listening
to
what
my
conscience
dictates
and
that
insists
on
my
doing
my
duty
by
the
woman
who
bears
my
name
and
whose
child
i
have
made
my
own
leo
was
eager
to
know
how
she
had
taken
the
news
but
was
ashamed
to
try
and
glean
the
information
from
his
friend
by
crooked
questionings
however
as
it
proved
there
was
no
need
for
ulrich
on
his
own
accord
told
him
all
he
wanted
to
know
i
did
not
think
he
said
that
felicitas
who
lives
and
forgets
so
rapidly
would
have
been
so
deeply
moved
at
your
return
i
must
say
that
without
taking
credit
to
myself
god
knows
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
i
believed
that
she
had
completely
got
over
her
grief
for
the
loss
of
rhaden
she
scarcely
ever
mentions
his
name
and
even
forgets
the
anniversary
of
his
death
and
for
two
years
i
have
as
tactfully
as
i
could
endeavoured
to
impress
on
her
your
innocence
in
that
unfortunate
accident
for
as
an
accident
pure
and
simple
i
have
always
regarded
the
fatal
duel
it
seems
that
it
has
all
been
in
vain
the
first
thing
that
happened
yesterday
was
that
she
went
into
hysterics
i
was
afraid
she
was
going
to
be
seriously
ill
the
whole
night
she
sat
on
the
boy
bed
murmuring
over
him
i
got
her
away
early
this
morning
almost
by
force
for
the
poor
boy
too
was
deprived
of
his
night
rest
you
will
believe
me
dear
leo
when
i
say
that
all
this
makes
me
bound
to
admit
that
she
has
right
on
her
side
leo
was
silent
if
he
had
spoken
it
would
have
been
hypocrisy
and
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
that
when
she
had
become
calmer
ulrich
went
on
i
told
her
of
our
conversation
and
of
the
fears
you
had
entertained
about
the
continuance
of
our
intercourse
i
wanted
to
prove
to
her
by
that
how
much
you
had
considered
the
condition
of
her
feelings
but
the
effect
was
quite
contrary
from
what
i
had
expected
especially
what
you
said
about
the
child
seemed
to
excite
her
to
the
last
degree
forgive
me
dear
old
boy
if
it
was
a
blunder
to
repeat
it
i
hoped
it
would
help
both
you
and
me
why
should
i
repeat
to
you
all
her
expressions
of
resentment
against
you
it
is
unnecessary
to
tear
open
old
wounds
you
may
believe
me
that
i
know
how
to
distinguish
between
the
hysterical
exaggerations
to
which
she
gave
vent
in
her
grief
and
the
grief
itself
but
that
is
genuine
enough
and
when
she
says
can
i
touch
your
hand
when
i
know
that
it
has
lain
in
the
hand
which
struck
down
my
child
father
when
she
says
that
she
is
right
a
thousand
times
right
i
ought
to
have
foreseen
it
all
before
i
linked
her
fate
with
mine
now
it
is
done
and
in
your
words
it
has
come
to
the
decision
must
choose
between
me
and
her
still
leo
was
silent
the
fatal
image
of
the
woman
glided
before
his
eyes
it
seemed
to
melt
into
the
gold
of
the
evening
clouds
and
with
the
damp
mist
to
fill
the
darkening
world
how
came
it
that
she
had
been
able
to
rob
him
of
what
was
dearest
to
him
on
earth
and
what
was
worse
than
anything
else
she
was
justified
it
was
only
strange
that
she
who
as
a
rule
was
given
to
and
avoided
anything
like
resolute
action
had
proved
herself
in
this
almost
firmer
than
he
was
but
then
of
course
she
had
no
friend
to
lose
i
thank
you
old
boy
ulrich
went
on
for
not
reproaching
or
laughing
at
me
not
that
any
contradiction
on
your
part
would
have
been
of
the
least
use
the
facts
are
inexorable
and
what
we
are
doing
is
the
only
natural
course
to
take
yes
leo
assented
staring
out
of
the
window
if
ulrich
had
only
guessed
what
truth
he
was
speaking
and
now
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
except
as
it
were
to
make
my
last
bequests
when
you
want
me
i
shall
come
to
you
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
in
good
or
evil
fortune
i
shall
expect
the
same
from
you
even
though
in
ordinary
circumstances
we
shall
have
no
alternative
but
to
pass
each
other
by
with
a
silent
pressure
of
the
hand
it
must
be
as
you
decide
said
leo
and
he
felt
a
dull
aching
at
his
heart
ulrich
sat
rigid
and
upright
every
muscle
brought
into
obedience
to
the
power
of
his
will
his
burning
eyes
rested
unwaveringly
on
his
friend
face
as
if
he
would
fain
absorb
him
with
his
gaze
not
once
did
his
voice
tremble
just
one
word
more
old
boy
he
said
before
we
part
i
have
to
make
an
open
confession
to
you
concerning
a
certain
matter
and
to
ask
your
pardon
you
will
find
in
your
books
the
constant
occurrence
of
a
sum
of
money
which
you
will
not
be
able
to
explain
interest
called
in
by
then
follows
my
name
leo
was
all
attention
the
sum
comes
altogether
to
thousand
and
a
few
hundred
marks
you
know
you
had
no
ready
money
it
fell
to
my
share
to
save
the
sinking
ship
so
i
gave
what
was
necessary
out
of
my
own
means
to
set
it
afloat
again
forgive
the
deception
and
do
thank
me
no
i
wo
be
thanked
he
repeated
as
leo
stood
up
and
seemed
as
if
he
were
going
to
rush
and
embrace
him
anything
i
have
is
always
at
your
service
that
of
course
is
an
understood
thing
and
now
good
luck
and
he
was
making
quickly
for
the
door
but
at
the
last
moment
he
was
seized
with
one
of
those
attacks
which
leo
with
dread
had
seen
coming
on
for
several
minutes
he
fell
across
the
sofa
growing
deadly
pale
his
eyes
were
fixed
his
pulse
stood
still
and
he
lost
consciousness
leo
had
known
these
symptoms
from
earliest
youth
and
also
knew
the
remedy
as
he
fell
he
had
caught
ulrich
head
in
his
arms
and
began
massaging
his
scalp
vigorously
with
his
after
a
few
seconds
the
eyes
recovered
their
ordinary
expression
a
gentle
flow
of
blood
mounted
to
his
temples
and
he
came
to
himself
again
thank
you
dear
old
boy
he
said
standing
up
with
a
sad
smile
once
more
i
have
lived
to
experience
your
skill
in
casting
out
the
little
white
mice
and
he
seized
his
hat
leo
begged
him
to
wait
till
he
had
quite
recovered
but
ulrich
refused
no
loitering
he
said
it
will
only
excite
us
again
and
prolong
the
agony
the
carriage
had
driven
round
to
the
door
for
a
moment
he
let
his
thin
delicate
hand
rest
tremblingly
in
leo
hard
palm
then
he
wrenched
himself
away
remember
me
to
your
people
he
said
covering
himself
with
the
the
horses
started
and
the
carriage
rolled
away
with
subdued
crunching
of
wheels
unto
the
purple
evening
dusk
leo
half
blinded
by
his
rising
tears
staggered
back
unto
his
study
be
sensible
no
whining
do
be
an
old
woman
he
cried
preaching
courage
to
himself
for
it
was
right
that
this
should
be
only
thus
could
all
be
made
straight
again
viii
the
feeling
which
events
had
left
behind
in
hertha
mind
was
one
of
dull
disappointment
it
seemed
almost
as
if
she
had
expended
all
her
trouble
on
an
unworthy
object
so
long
he
had
existed
for
her
as
an
exalted
sinner
one
of
those
melancholy
romantic
beings
whom
it
is
the
delight
of
a
true
woman
to
rescue
from
hell
and
now
he
stood
before
her
in
the
flesh
a
muscular
laughing
country
squire
with
broad
shoulders
and
a
vocabulary
that
could
only
be
described
as
vulgar
though
alas
it
certainly
had
the
knack
of
hitting
the
right
nail
on
the
head
even
his
method
of
dealing
with
his
staff
of
retainers
was
quite
different
from
what
she
had
pictured
with
the
righteous
wrath
of
an
outraged
deity
she
had
expected
him
to
scourge
the
unfaithful
servants
out
of
his
sight
to
mete
out
to
the
miscreants
their
deserts
but
to
reward
those
who
had
been
honest
and
vigilant
by
giving
them
an
honourable
post
at
his
right
hand
but
now
that
her
dreams
had
become
reality
all
was
as
prosaic
as
possible
he
swore
and
the
servants
slunk
about
like
whipped
hounds
and
she
had
not
been
once
consulted
the
hated
uncle
kutowski
too
for
whom
she
would
have
thought
the
gallows
too
good
seemed
to
be
taking
his
departure
in
far
too
easy
and
comfortable
a
fashion
on
the
second
day
he
appeared
just
after
breakfast
in
freshly
ironed
linen
and
buff
waistcoat
on
which
his
of
tusks
dangled
aggressively
and
explained
to
the
ladies
that
he
had
come
to
take
his
leave
of
them
in
order
to
enter
on
a
larger
sphere
of
work
in
poland
where
formerly
he
had
possessed
land
there
was
a
complication
of
affairs
which
to
be
put
straight
required
the
firm
hand
and
the
knowledge
of
modern
agricultural
improvements
of
a
confidential
such
as
himself
he
set
this
forth
with
the
utmost
and
stroked
his
wavy
beard
with
true
patriarchal
dignity
but
his
little
eyes
glanced
uneasily
at
the
door
from
time
to
time
as
if
he
were
afraid
that
leo
might
come
in
and
cut
off
his
brilliant
retreat
grandmamma
was
enough
to
accept
the
old
reprobate
explanation
without
question
elly
gravely
went
on
with
her
painting
and
hertha
herself
could
do
nothing
but
show
her
contempt
by
shrugging
her
shoulders
which
apparently
did
hurt
his
feelings
in
the
least
finally
he
had
the
effrontery
to
ask
the
young
ladies
to
give
him
their
photographs
and
to
wish
them
handsome
bridegrooms
this
was
a
little
too
much
for
hertha
i
only
give
my
photograph
to
people
whom
i
have
learnt
to
esteem
said
she
drawing
herself
up
and
if
i
ever
should
marry
which
i
am
uncertain
about
at
present
i
shall
take
care
to
choose
a
husband
who
has
no
associates
like
yourself
herr
kutowski
now
he
had
got
his
due
and
all
grandmamma
tact
could
not
alter
it
he
bowed
and
with
a
malicious
smile
remarked
that
he
always
knew
that
miss
hertha
could
not
endure
him
but
that
was
not
here
or
there
now
the
master
had
come
home
she
would
find
out
fast
enough
what
it
was
to
be
a
stranger
in
the
house
and
what
a
true
friend
she
had
had
in
him
hertha
hard
hit
cast
down
her
eyes
but
kind
old
grandmamma
put
her
arm
protectingly
round
her
neck
whereupon
the
old
gentleman
lighted
a
cigar
thrust
a
sandwich
of
buttered
rolls
into
his
pocket
squeezed
out
a
few
farewell
tears
and
after
elly
with
characteristic
meekness
had
submitted
to
having
her
forehead
kissed
by
his
atrocious
lips
he
retired
in
the
of
the
chivalrous
old
worthy
all
the
morning
hertha
carried
about
with
her
a
sense
of
intolerable
wrong
it
was
not
till
she
heard
leo
after
lunch
say
to
his
mother
the
old
uncle
by
jove
has
been
summarily
dismissed
did
she
feel
slightly
comforted
and
concluded
that
perhaps
after
all
the
world
had
not
been
made
so
comfortable
for
unpunished
rogues
as
she
had
supposed
her
relations
with
the
returned
master
of
the
house
somewhat
improved
he
had
addressed
a
few
playful
remarks
to
her
at
meals
and
had
taken
her
retorts
with
gay
good
humour
it
looked
as
if
he
had
quite
forgotten
that
she
had
offended
him
he
does
think
i
am
grown
up
she
reflected
bitterly
and
the
idea
she
had
entertained
the
whole
day
of
asking
him
formally
for
forgiveness
was
gradually
abandoned
it
was
after
tea
that
he
came
to
her
and
in
his
usual
lighthearted
and
lively
manner
said
now
then
little
one
if
you
like
we
will
do
some
accounts
she
glowed
under
a
swelling
wave
of
pride
at
last
he
had
asked
her
had
felt
himself
forced
to
regard
her
management
of
certain
departments
as
a
serious
matter
but
she
would
not
have
been
so
proud
if
she
had
suspected
that
grandmamma
had
hinted
to
him
that
it
would
give
her
pleasure
if
he
would
go
over
her
accounts
with
her
her
books
were
in
beautiful
order
since
yesterday
morning
she
had
longed
to
show
him
the
blue
octavo
but
had
not
had
the
courage
to
do
so
uninvited
now
sitting
opposite
him
she
produced
records
of
her
heroic
achievements
with
flaming
cheeks
she
had
reared
and
fattened
twelve
turkeys
and
sold
ten
in
königsberg
she
had
sent
eighty
chickens
to
the
münsterberg
market
and
got
an
average
price
of
pfennigs
apiece
for
them
the
sound
eggs
that
were
over
had
been
bought
at
home
by
a
dealer
so
that
no
deduction
had
to
be
made
for
waste
a
greater
bargain
still
was
in
course
of
completion
for
unfattened
geese
though
some
were
to
be
stuffed
for
the
sake
of
the
liver
but
the
season
had
not
come
yet
for
that
then
she
passed
on
to
the
vegetable
department
fresh
vegetables
were
sent
every
saturday
regularly
to
the
market
at
münsterberg
but
it
scarcely
paid
to
compete
with
the
peasant
folk
still
in
another
direction
a
great
success
had
been
scored
she
got
several
dozen
little
baskets
plaited
from
reeds
which
a
blind
man
made
her
for
twopence
each
these
little
baskets
were
daintily
arranged
with
leaves
and
filled
according
to
the
season
with
strawberries
cherries
and
other
fruit
the
offered
them
for
sale
in
münsterberg
and
they
had
enjoyed
quite
a
reputation
three
days
later
all
the
little
baskets
were
collected
empty
but
if
any
customers
wished
to
keep
basket
as
well
as
fruit
they
were
to
pay
threepence
more
and
this
extra
penny
helped
to
pay
the
old
blind
man
her
face
was
radiant
with
zeal
her
hair
wild
and
her
hands
trembled
as
she
sat
there
calculating
one
sum
of
money
after
the
other
she
would
have
liked
to
demonstrate
her
success
by
showing
him
the
figures
but
no
matter
how
she
turned
over
the
leaves
she
could
not
find
the
total
and
the
columns
swam
before
her
in
crazy
confusion
and
in
the
midst
of
her
narration
she
had
caught
him
looking
at
her
with
an
inquiring
astonished
gaze
and
she
felt
a
choking
sensation
of
sheer
joy
in
her
throat
but
she
collected
herself
and
proceeded
further
with
her
good
tidings
she
had
come
now
to
the
most
important
thing
of
all
the
milk
and
the
dairy
produce
here
of
course
she
had
not
been
able
to
do
as
much
as
she
wished
for
these
stupendous
affairs
came
under
uncle
management
however
she
had
got
round
schumann
and
worked
him
so
effectually
that
he
was
willing
to
help
her
the
experiment
of
sending
cream
in
bottles
to
königsberg
had
been
a
failure
but
for
slightly
salted
fresh
butter
a
trade
had
been
opened
with
friedrich
graz
in
berlin
which
was
doing
business
this
did
not
hinder
the
morning
milk
according
to
old
custom
being
despatched
by
waggon
to
münsterberg
and
she
felt
bound
to
confess
with
pride
that
the
popularity
of
the
halewitz
had
increased
considerably
the
daily
demand
for
milk
she
and
the
swineherd
were
at
war
as
to
how
the
ought
to
be
used
the
swiss
cook
at
stoltenhof
had
given
her
a
famous
receipt
for
making
cheese
of
the
mamselle
had
made
excellent
use
of
it
yet
all
the
leavings
were
demanded
for
the
pigs
although
they
could
very
well
be
fed
on
the
husks
and
refuse
from
the
brewery
hertha
thought
these
claims
preposterous
and
hoped
that
leo
would
see
that
the
lion
share
of
the
were
restored
to
its
proper
uses
and
now
she
had
finished
and
she
laid
the
blue
down
with
modest
satisfaction
and
went
back
to
grandmamma
who
had
been
listening
to
her
report
beaming
with
delight
he
followed
her
and
grasped
her
industrious
little
hand
with
a
smile
in
which
there
was
a
gleam
of
almost
paternal
emotion
you
are
a
plucky
little
girl
he
said
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
that
was
all
he
might
at
least
have
said
that
he
hoped
she
would
go
on
and
prosper
she
ran
out
to
cool
her
hot
cheeks
in
the
shade
of
the
limes
her
throat
felt
like
lead
from
her
strangled
tears
she
was
depressed
by
the
consciousness
that
her
soul
elated
triumph
had
been
followed
by
a
humiliation
she
had
expected
something
tremendous
unspeakable
what
she
hardly
knew
herself
at
any
rate
she
need
not
have
been
thanked
so
curtly
almost
grudgingly
near
the
obelisk
she
came
on
elly
exercising
grandmamma
pug
at
the
end
of
a
blue
ribbon
which
was
not
in
the
least
necessary
she
ran
to
meet
hertha
with
an
air
of
great
importance
saying
a
terrible
misfortune
had
happened
and
her
whole
future
happiness
was
at
stake
she
really
thought
she
should
have
to
put
an
end
to
herself
what
the
matter
asked
hertha
it
was
this
christian
had
reported
that
this
morning
a
sealed
letter
addressed
to
her
had
been
lying
on
uncle
kutowski
table
and
that
now
it
had
disappeared
well
what
harm
is
there
in
that
asked
hertha
you
should
never
have
had
any
secrets
with
that
dreadful
old
man
elly
blushed
and
stuttered
she
had
not
exactly
had
secrets
it
was
only
that
uncle
had
been
so
obliging
and
the
last
time
she
had
met
kurt
brenckenberg
he
had
promised
that
the
song
he
had
composed
for
her
should
be
sent
to
her
through
uncle
kutowski
if
you
will
do
such
stupid
things
mouse
said
hertha
turning
her
back
we
ca
go
on
being
friends
but
elly
threw
her
arms
around
her
from
behind
and
entreated
and
implored
her
to
help
her
just
this
once
she
would
never
do
it
again
and
when
she
had
sealed
this
vow
with
a
solemn
kiss
and
shake
of
the
hand
hertha
consented
to
do
what
she
could
in
advising
her
first
of
all
it
seemed
advisable
to
reconnoitre
the
spot
where
the
letter
had
been
seen
in
the
morning
hertha
made
a
short
cut
through
bushes
and
hedge
to
the
house
and
elly
who
despite
her
agitation
had
not
let
go
of
the
fat
pug
obediently
followed
the
bailiff
house
was
deserted
as
usual
at
this
hour
and
in
consequence
locked
up
the
only
way
to
get
in
was
through
an
open
window
at
the
back
hertha
who
could
climb
like
a
squirrel
took
the
lead
and
dragged
the
trembling
elly
after
her
the
pug
who
was
in
danger
of
being
strangled
by
the
blue
ribbon
was
left
behind
and
barked
as
if
he
were
mad
at
his
vanishing
mistresses
they
found
themselves
in
schumann
room
which
was
filled
with
an
odour
of
onions
and
for
the
was
a
bachelor
and
catered
for
himself
leaving
unspeakable
messes
simmering
for
hours
on
a
petroleum
elly
could
scarcely
stand
for
fright
and
even
hertha
heart
beat
perceptibly
quicker
till
this
moment
she
had
never
shrunk
timidly
from
the
boldest
adventures
but
now
that
the
master
of
halewitz
ruled
his
possessions
again
everything
wore
a
different
aspect
she
penetrated
further
without
looking
to
right
or
left
the
door
which
led
to
the
uncle
deserted
apartments
was
wide
open
within
a
repulsive
spectacle
was
revealed
in
one
corner
the
old
sofa
lay
in
ruins
the
bedstead
was
turned
up
against
the
wall
the
cupboard
doors
were
flung
back
on
their
hinges
and
in
all
the
places
which
had
been
mercifully
hidden
by
carpet
and
dirt
was
laid
bare
for
the
old
sloven
had
let
it
accumulate
for
years
hairy
spiders
sat
in
the
corners
and
disturbed
ran
out
of
the
cracks
in
the
floor
on
the
table
where
christian
had
caught
sight
of
the
fatal
letter
lay
the
cracked
with
the
pig
bladder
and
odds
and
ends
of
tobacco
and
all
sorts
of
papers
but
the
passionately
coveted
envelope
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
hertha
searched
the
room
with
the
thoroughness
of
a
detective
she
tore
open
the
table
drawer
threw
herself
on
the
floor
to
spy
under
bureau
and
wardrobe
she
even
shook
the
which
stood
ranged
in
a
row
against
the
wall
covered
with
baize
but
not
a
trace
could
she
discover
of
the
missing
letter
between
the
windows
propped
against
the
birchwood
chest
of
drawers
there
was
an
old
bookcase
much
scratched
and
ornamented
with
paintings
hertha
after
a
fleeting
glance
plucked
up
courage
to
examine
it
closer
two
rows
of
books
stood
or
lay
on
the
shelves
some
of
them
bound
others
in
covers
this
then
was
the
uncle
library
that
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
boasting
was
the
most
interesting
in
the
world
when
you
are
particularly
nice
to
me
he
would
say
i
will
invite
you
to
look
through
it
but
there
the
matter
had
dropped
for
hertha
had
never
felt
inclined
to
be
particularly
nice
to
him
and
nowhere
was
this
celebrated
library
without
lock
or
custodian
absolutely
at
her
disposal
and
hours
might
go
by
before
one
of
the
inmates
of
the
house
might
surprise
her
deep
in
its
treasures
she
was
so
delighted
that
even
the
fatal
letter
was
forgotten
hertha
with
trembling
fingers
touched
the
paper
covers
and
looking
into
the
first
that
lay
on
the
pile
read
the
adventures
of
queen
isabella
or
secrets
of
the
court
of
madrid
a
title
which
excited
her
curiosity
to
the
highest
pitch
as
time
was
precious
she
began
to
read
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence
on
which
she
had
chanced
to
open
elly
who
had
been
standing
about
rather
aimlessly
crouched
beside
her
and
tried
to
snatch
a
modest
share
of
the
forbidden
book
splendours
over
her
companion
shoulder
it
was
all
about
a
handsome
young
don
alvarez
who
returning
from
a
party
late
at
night
is
seized
by
masked
ruffians
gagged
and
blindfolded
and
dragged
into
a
luxurious
mysterious
brilliantly
lighted
apartment
where
from
behind
red
satin
curtains
proceeded
ravishing
strains
of
sweet
music
from
cymbals
and
flutes
and
when
he
at
last
dares
to
draw
aside
the
curtain
what
does
he
see
a
coffin
from
the
pall
of
which
a
skull
with
two
crossed
skeleton
legs
grins
at
him
in
scorn
flames
and
incense
rise
to
the
ceiling
and
a
sepulchral
voice
speaks
in
the
clouds
that
is
the
coffin
in
which
you
will
lie
in
the
same
hour
that
you
betray
by
one
word
or
look
what
your
eyes
have
seen
and
your
ears
heard
so
the
shuddering
young
soul
was
to
keep
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
a
secret
till
the
end
of
time
hertha
heard
a
bark
and
as
if
waking
out
of
a
dream
saw
leo
figure
standing
its
full
height
close
beside
her
the
pug
who
had
evidently
shown
him
the
way
was
at
his
heels
the
book
fell
from
her
hand
don
alvarez
sank
into
the
night
of
oblivion
from
which
he
had
sprung
what
are
you
doing
here
you
burglars
asked
leo
in
a
laughing
tone
he
was
answered
by
silence
and
how
did
you
get
in
come
confess
elly
the
door
was
locked
how
did
you
get
in
hertha
felt
an
internal
swooning
but
defiance
choked
in
her
throat
you
need
rate
elly
like
that
she
said
getting
up
as
the
door
was
locked
we
naturally
got
through
the
window
there
is
nothing
to
be
surprised
at
in
that
indeed
he
said
nothing
to
be
surprised
at
and
what
brings
you
here
that
we
do
intend
to
tell
hertha
answered
it
is
our
concern
alone
now
we
shall
see
about
that
he
said
i
am
not
going
to
argue
with
you
my
dear
hertha
you
are
beyond
discipline
but
you
elly
come
here
a
minute
and
elly
who
had
quite
lost
her
presence
of
mind
regardless
of
a
sign
that
hertha
made
to
her
divulged
in
stupid
fear
everything
she
should
have
kept
to
herself
a
letter
he
inquired
a
letter
from
uncle
kutowski
to
you
yes
she
answered
crying
he
simply
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
produced
the
letter
is
that
it
he
asked
elly
supposed
with
sobs
that
it
must
be
it
but
as
he
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
wrench
open
the
envelope
hertha
considered
it
her

surely

secrets
i
shall
certainly
be
so
unchivalrous
he
responded
and
tore
the
envelope
open
for
shame
said
hertha
and
turned
away
but
he
read
aloud
smiling
stars
serenade
composed
for
and
dedicated
to
fräulein
elly
von
sellenthin
as
a
token
of
his
esteem
and
regard
by
kurt
brenckenberg
whereupon
he
gave
a
little
whistle
and
slowly
ripped
the
beautiful
verses
into
tiny
fragments
which
he
scattered
at
his
weeping
feet
let
that
be
a
lesson
to
you
he
said
knitting
his
thick
brows
and
if
i
find
out
anything
of
the
sort
has
happened
again
it
will
be
a
bad
for
you
we
may
go
now

hope
asked
hertha
as
she
scanned
him
sideways
from
under
downcast
lids
yes
you
may
go
he
replied
there
only
one
thing
more
to
say
for
the
future
there
will
be
no
more
underhand
dealings
here
do
you
understand
hertha
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
turned
to
go
she
had
done
with
this
rude
man
for
ever
elly
who
was
again
leading
the
pug
by
the
blue
ribbon
followed
in
sobs
when
leo
was
alone
he
laughed
out
loud
what
depths
of
innocence
he
said
to
himself
and
thought
of
the
he
had
met
and
dropped
abroad
who
were
now
separated
from
him
by
the
ocean
and
then
he
thought
of
another
whose
life
was
not
divided
from
his
by
the
sea
but
who
must
be
considered
as
dropped
none
the

then
turned

ix
the
student
of
philosophy
kurt
brenckenberg
strolled
between
the
borders
of
the
parsonage
garden
at
wengern
and
enjoyed
the
early
freshness
of
the
sunny
sabbath
morning
he
had
slept
late
shaved
curled
his
moustache
and
felt
his
mind
full
of
sublime
idealism
and
his
heart
full
of
longing
for
a
fair
mistress
he
also
congratulated
himself
on
the
heroic
fortitude
with
which
he
had
thrown
off
the
effects
of
the
last
night
carousal
he
smoked
his
cigar
in
a
humour
waiting
till
his
sister
should
have
finished
ironing
his
which
she
seemed
to
have
taken
an
endless
time
over
i
shall
be
obliged
to
make
a
row
about
it
he
said
to
himself
service
in
the
parental
establishment
left
much
to
be
desired
when
the
things
came
from
the
wash
they
were
not
fit
to
be
seen
there
was
not
a
trace
in
them
of
the
stiffness
and
glaze
which
are
the
artistic
triumphs
of
the
professional
laundress
he
who
knew
what
was
due
to
himself
as
a
felt
it
his
duty
not
to
neglect
his
personal
appearance
but
to
keep
up
the
dignity
of
his
badges
daily
and
hourly
in
face
of
the
country
bumpkins
the
eldest
of
nine
olive
branches
which
had
sprung
from
the
nuptials
of
old
pastor
brenckenberg
he
had
gone
to
the
university
in
his
nineteenth
year
it
was
vaguely
reported
to
study
the
dead
and
oriental
tongues
nothing
more
definite
was
ever
gleaned
about
the
calling
he
had
chosen
for
he
did
not
consider
it
seemly
to
discuss
such
trivialities
he
left
that
sort
of
thing
to
the
swats
as
he
himself
put
it
it
was
quite
undeniably
certain
however
that
he
had
fought
fourteen
duels
and
had
been
gashed
nine
times
that
he
had
been
concerned
in
two
scandals
and
a
intrigue
and
that
he
had
cultivated
the
drinking
of
beer
to
a
fine
art
neither
could
it
be
disputed
that
he
had
been
captain
of
two
student
clubs
the
westphalians
and
the
normans
he
boasted
therefore
the
title
after
his
name
guestphaliæ
xx
normanneaque
x
and
thus
he
figured
on
the
bills
of
exchange
and
promissory
notes
which
his
father
received
periodically
accompanied
by
a
polite
request
for
payment
till
that
worthy
declared
it
must
now
stop
and
that
the
young
would
not
get
a
brass
farthing
more
out
of
him
he
had
remained
firm
and
his
mother
tears
and
intercession
for
her
darling
had
been
in
vain
one
fine
day
at
the
beginning
of
february
in
consequence
of
the
paternal
hardness
of
heart
the
son
and
heir
arrived
at
the
parsonage
and
announced
his
intention
of
staying
there
for
the
present
in
the
admiring
eyes
of
his
mother
he
blazed
out
as
the
possessor
of
a
light
braided
suit
the
coat
of
which
was
very
narrow
and
the
trousers
very
wide
of
ribbons
and
badges
denoting
the
colours
of
his
corps
an
ivory
scarf
pin
in
the
shape
of
the
corps
monogram
a
gold
bangle
with
a
sham
thaler
representing
george
and
the
dragon
also
bearing
the
corps
monogram
attached
to
it
a
swagger
on
the
knob
of
which
the
monogram
was
engraved
a
full
of
the
eternal
monogram
and
a
purse
which
contained
no
silver
except
the
monogram
on
the
clasp
for
the
rest
his
trunk
had
little
else
in
it
save
a
book
of
bound
in
calf
a
few
bills
of
exchange
a
broken
meerschaum
and
a
whole
pile
of
dirty
ragged
linen
marked
above
his
name
with
the
monogram
in
shot
floss
silk
his
mother
a
worthy
and
uneducated
woman
was
not
a
little
perplexed
at
the
constantly
recurring
hieroglyphic
but
she
was
far
too
infatuated
with
her
darling
to
think
anything
that
he
did
ridiculous
while
he
was
thus
displaying
his
splendours
to
the
brothers
and
sisters
his
father
came
in
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
it
is
impossible
to
go
on
studying
without
money
was
the
prompt
reply
come
to
my
study
the
doting
mother
foresaw
a
scene
she
hung
on
her
husband
arm
and
stroked
it
coaxingly
but
he
shook
her
off
with
a
rough
exclamation
a
few
minutes
later
two
resounding
boxes
on
the
ear
were
heard
coming
from
the
study
and
the
outraged
remonstrance
of
a
virtuous
youth
father
i
am
a
almost
at
the
same
moment
he
flew
back
into
the
family
and
declared
that
he
must
go
away
again
instantly
he
had
no
home
now
and
his
mother
must
pack
his
things
the
packing
was
quickly
accomplished
but
when
evening
came
kurt
brenckenberg
had
not
gone
the
next
morning
too
he
appeared
at
the
breakfast
table
he
did
not
vouchsafe
his
father
a
glance
and
once
more
announced
his
determination
to
leave
by
the
first
train
as
he
had
no
home
so
it
went
on
for
several
days
and
his
father
who
might
be
repenting
his
violence
let
him
alone
when
a
week
had
passed
he
caught
his
son
by
the
and
said
as
you
intend
to
go
away
we
will
have
a
farewell
drink
together
put
on
your
cap
and
come
along
kurt
acquiesced
and
two
hours
after
midnight
he
played
the
part
of
the
good
samaritan
by
bringing
home
his
father
whose
drunken
state
within
a
circuit
of
six
miles
no
creature
would
have
taken
pity
on
he
made
up
a
bed
for
him
on
the
sofa
so
that
his
spouse
should
not
be
disturbed
in
her
slumbers
after
this
no
more
was
said
about
his
going
away
the
relations
between
father
and
son
became
day
by
day
more
intimate
since
his
own
offspring
had
beaten
him
at
beer
drinking
he
had
made
no
further
attempt
to
assert
his
paternal
authority
and
allowed
his
son
to
come
and
go
about
the
house
at
any
hours
he
pleased
only
he
could
not
give
him
money
for
the
noble
youth
escapades
had
cleared
him
out
of
a
year
income
in
advance
as
he
himself
put
it
there
was
scarcely
a
halfpenny
left
for
the
communion
collection
through
the
winter
kurt
brenckenberg
had
lorded
it
partly
on
the
neighbouring
estates
partly
in
his
father
house
where
he
was
dissatisfied
with
everything
and
perpetually
bullied
and
grumbled
at
his
brothers
and
sisters
he
drank
composed
songs
made
himself
agreeable
or
arrogant
according
to
the
sex
of
his
associates
borrowed
where
it
was
possible
to
borrow
and
cut
as
elegant
an
appearance
as
was
permitted
by
the
increasing
shabbiness
of
the
last
check
suit
supplied
by
kessel
and
munchmann
of
on
credit
to
corps
students
he
got
up
private
theatricals
contrived
new
figures
for
the
cotillion
gave
fencing
lessons
and
had
understood
on
the
whole
how
to
make
himself
indispensable
ladies
gushed
about
him
but
men
rather
avoided
him
because
if
they
so
much
as
looked
at
him
sideways
they
were
apt
to
be
confronted
with
the
disconcerting
question
snapped
out
in
tone
of
intimidation
will
you
give
satisfaction
not
that
the
sturdy
young
squires
of
the
hinterwald
district
were
by
any
means
cowards
on
the
contrary
they
had
proved
often
enough
that
they
were
ready
where
their
honour
was
concerned
to
engage
in
any
daring
combat
it
was
only
in
the
case
of
this
little
bristling
whom
they
regarded
scarcely
as
their
equal
by
half
that
they
felt
stiff
and
embarrassed
often
as
he
boasted
of
his
little
adventures
with
pistols
he
never
gave
a
practical
demonstration
of
anything
of
the
sort
he
it
was
who
for
the
most
part
at
the
conclusion
of
the
challenge
formalities
proved
himself
a
model
of
wise
moderation
but
even
this
fact
resulted
in
the
increase
of
his
reputation
in
the
and
made
his
pose
as
an
irreconcilable
combatant
the
more
effective
for
his
part
he
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
continue
the
of
the
celebrated
oswald
stein
who
two
generations
earlier
had
turned
the
heads
of
all
the
rustic
young
pomeranian
rustics
and
he
made
no
secret
that
the
ideal
on
which
he
modelled
himself
was
the
hero
of
problematical
natures
accordingly
he
had
entered
on
a
sentimental
love
episode
with
the
pretty
daughter
of
halewitz
and
by
the
spring
hoped
at
last
to
have
found
his
melitta
for
it
was
at
about
this
time
that
ulrich
von
kletzingk
summoned
him
to
uhlenfelde
to
act
as
private
tutor
to
his
little
stepson
the
boy
was
delicate
and
not
to
be
overworked
so
he
had
all
the
more
leisure
at
his
disposal
in
which
to
pay
court
to
the
beautiful
mistress
of
the
castle
it
was
patent
that
she
was
a
flirt
how
otherwise
would
she
have
kept
dangling
about
her
all
the
cavaliers
young
and
old
of
the
neighbourhood
she
also
had
some
sense
for
she
did
what
she
pleased
quite
unconcerned
by
the
gossip
of
friendly
neighbours
and
the
famous
duel
had
proved
that
she
was
in
possession
of
an
interesting
past
nevertheless
she
had
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
his
addresses
he
had
hardly
dared
hope
for
anything
but
indifference
he
languished
at
her
feet
despairing
full
of
worship
and
a
desire
to
die
for
her
as
the
pages
of
olden
times
had
loved
their
queens
so
he
revelled
in
this
hopeless
passion
it
seemed
sometimes
almost
as
if
his
homage
rather
pleased
her
as
if
she
saw
the
necessity
as
he
did
for
a
little
harmless
romance
with
the
tutor
no
check
was
put
on
his
poetical
effusions
his
sighs
and
speeches
he
might
if
he
liked
break
his
neck
in
knightly
service
or
above
all
attempt
great
things
in
verse
he
scattered
his
leaflets
about
the
house
and
garden
sometimes
he
placed
them
under
her
knitting
or
in
an
uncut
book
yes
he
had
even
had
the
temerity
to
put
them
under
her
pillow
and
in
smiling
silence
she
had
ignored
everything
yet
his
unrequited
passion
had
not
in
the
least
altered
his
manner
of
life
he
ate
enough
for
three
and
drank
enough
for
a
dozen
he
consorted
with
the
bailiffs
in
the
hopes
that
they
might
lend
him
money
and
after
dark
he
flirted
with
the
dairymaids
and
in
the
stables
or
under
the
by
the
water
but
this
brilliant
career
so
rich
in
every
sort
of
experience
and
sentiment
was
doomed
and
drawing
to
its
close
his
first
hint
that
it
was
so
had
been
three
days
ago
when
baron
von
kletzingk
had
informed
him
that
for
the
present
his
services
must
be
dispensed
with
his
wife
having
emphatically
expressed
a
wish
to
teach
the
boy
herself
for
the
next
few
weeks
this
decision
alone
might
not
have
counted
for
much
for
frau
felicitas
changed
her
mind
as
often
as
a
new
idea
came
into
her
curly
head
but
what
upset
him
most
was
an
unpleasant
change
in
her
manner
towards
him
which
he
had
remarked
several
days
previously
she
had
become
cold
almost
severe
and
when
he
had
resorted
to
the
usual
method
of
letting
her
know
his
feelings
she
had
after
morning
coffee
put
a
question
to
him
with
a
languid
smile
and
yawn
how
did
these
atrocious
verses
get
into
my
basket
of
keys
herr
kandidat
this
was
rough
on
him
and
really
looked
as
if
he
were
out
of
favour
nevertheless
he
was
not
the
man
to
let
a
woman
foibles
break
his
heart
and
in
the
prussian
crown
at
münsterberg
only
the
night
before
he
had
again
thoroughly
enjoyed
a
booze
in
his
father
company
this
morning
the
sun
laughed
down
on
a
world
in
which
there
was
plenty
and
to
spare
of
women
love
if
only
he
could
have
had
his
clean
collar
his
satisfaction
would
have
been
complete
he
resolved
to
agitate
for
this
end
and
went
into
the
front
kitchen
where
lotty
his
eldest
sister
a
lean
unattractive
blonde
sulky
and
faithful
as
a
beast
of
burden
was
ironing
the
sunday
clean
linen
on
a
large
board
am
i
at
last
to
get
a
decent
rag
to
put
round
my
neck
he
shouted
at
her
dumbly
she
handed
him
a
collar
do
you
call
a
collar
he
cried
twirling
the
limp
strip
round
his
fingers
do
you
call
that
piece
of
a
collar
i
say
if
your
linen
is
starched
to
your
liking
get
it
up
yourself
the
sister
answered
snappishly
and
put
the
bellows
in
the
fire
under
the
till
smoke
and
cinders
flew
about
the
room
it
a
disgrace
kurt
said
that
a
man
should
be
compelled
to
interfere
in
such
sordid
household
matters
why
do
you
earn
money
enough
to
keep
a
laundress
of
your
own
asked
his
sister
instead
of
an
answer
he
threw
the
collar
at
her
head
and
she
screamed
out
for
help
to
her
mother
she
appeared
on
the
scene
in
a
white
and
her
grizzled
hair
caught
up
with
a
celluloid
comb
three
of
the
small
fry
trotted
after
her
she
was
already
worried
and
irritable
ca
you
be
quiet
she
stormed
father
is
busy
with
his
sermon
and
you
are
behaving
like
heathens
heathens
replied
kurt
are
at
least
in
the
happy
position
of
not
requiring
clean
linen
as
they
prefer
to
go
naked
yes

cried
his

for

trolled
forth
mimicking
her
a

the
harassed
mother
began
to
cry
for
vexation
and
the
little
ones
following
her
example
the
sunday
morning
concert
of
praise
was
in
full
swing
meanwhile
pastor
brenckenberg
suffering
from
severe
headache
sat
brooding
over
a
bulky
book
of
sermons
at
the
in
the
parlour
he
was
a
corpulent
man
of
over
sixty
tall
with
massive
shoulders
and
a
red
coarse
neck
he
wore
his
thin
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
combed
smoothly
behind
his
ears
so
that
it
framed
his
big
bloated
face
with
locks
like
those
with
which
christ
is
depicted
in
sacred
art
in
spite
of
the
hanging
cheeks
and
moist
protruding
sensual
lips
there
was
an
expression
of
power
and
strength
about
his
countenance
which
inspired
a
certain
reverence
and
respect
years
before
the
old
squire
sellenthin
had
appointed
him
tutor
and
to
his
wild
unmanageable
son
leo
though
he
might
be
thought
hardly
suitable
for
the
post
his
as
a
student
having
been
the
talk
of
the
but
the
keen
insight
into
character
of
the
old
man
of
the
world
had
not
been
at
fault
in
this
instance
the
new
private
tutor
ruled
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
at
the
same
time
made
himself
invaluable
as
a
perpetrator
of
dry
jokes
and
an
indefatigable
boon
companion
and
when
leo
was
ready
for
the
gymnasium
a
plucky
boy
in
his
teens
thoroughly
well
trained
and
prepared
herr
von
sellenthin
bestowed
on
the
convivial
clergyman
the
living
of
wengern
of
which
he
was
the
patron
on
the
strength
of
this
the
pastor
at
once
made
haste
to
renew
an
old
attachment
the
existence
of
which
no
one
had
had
any
suspicion
and
with
the
love
of
his
youth
as
his
bride
and
a
bonus
which
his
squire
had
given
him
began
to
populate
the
empty
old
parsonage
as
speedily
as
possible
hypocrisy
and
unctuous
piety
were
not
in
this
man
line
and
no
one
could
deny
that
he
was
possessed
of
a
certain
vein
of
cynical
good
humour
but
woe
to
the
erring
sheep
who
fell
a
victim
to
his
righteous
anger
one
of
the
stories
told
of
him
as
a
warning
to
others
was
that
of
the
overgrown
hobbledehoy
who
had
been
in
the
act
of
taking
himself
off
to
america
and
leaving
the
girl
he
had
brought
to
shame
behind
him
when
it
had
come
to
the
pastor
ears
he
had
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
had
so
nearly
throttled
him
that
the
seducer
black
in
the
face
had
sunk
on
to
his
knees
and
implored
him
to
let
him
go
promising
to
marry
the
girl
on
the
spot
and
to
stay
in
the
country
and
work
honestly
to
support
her
and
the
child
yet
in
spite
of
his
iron
rule
amongst
his
flock
he
himself
had
no
scruples
in
indulging
in
his
own
weaknesses
the
sunday
after
he
would
kneel
in
front
of
the
whole
congregation
wringing
his
hands
his
face
streaming
with
tears
and
send
up
fervent
supplications
for
divine
forgiveness
for
his
own
and
his
brother
sins
sometimes
when
it
chanced
that
an
town
clergyman
who
was
in
the
habit
of
entertaining
his
parishioners
at
home
with
sermons
of
a
liberal
tendency
interlarded
with
quotations
from
goethe
and
lessing
occupied
the
pulpit
at
wengern
in
his
stead
he
would
say
that
sort
of
thing
was
priestly
clowning
and
reminded
him
of
abraham
a
sancta
clara
the
natives
were
not
cultivated
enough
to
appreciate
it
the
old
man
had
long
been
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
of
the
several
times
at
church
council
meetings
the
subject
of
his
resignation
had
been
broached
but
owing
to
an
official
report
to
the
effect
that
the
standard
of
morality
was
higher
in
the
parish
of
wengern
than
anywhere
else
in
the
province
it
was
decided
to
leave
him
alone
the
flock
loved
their
shepherd
because
he
reflected
their
own
vices
and
weaknesses
and
their
own
rough
though
cute
mental
fibre
this
morning
pastor
brenckenberg
found
it
difficult
to
attune
his
thoughts
to
the
holy
scriptures
he
had
chosen
the
unexciting
theme
of
harvest
taking
for
his
text
the
verse
from
the
second
of
corinthians
he
that
had
gathered
much
had
nothing
over
and
he
that
had
gathered
little
had
no
lack
a
propos
he
had
tried
to
hang
together
a
few
consolatory
reflections
on
the
consequences
of
the
wet
summer
the
diseased
potato
crop
the
rotten
fruit
and
to
give
voice
to
joyous
thanksgiving
that
at
last
god
had
let
the
glorious
sun
shine
on
the
but
this
drivel
as
he
expressed
it
nauseated
him
he
was
in
a
mood
to
thunder
and
bruise
he
would
like
to
have
something
to
curse
shall
i
give
them
again
freshly
furbished
up
he
asked
himself
but
he
had
dealt
with
this
subject
only
a
fortnight
ago
i
must
let
their
burns
heal
first
and
then
i
can
go
for
them
once
more
also
the
last
judgment
the
story
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
in
its
modern
application
to
berlin
and
the
social
democrats
the
murder
case
the
diphtheria
outbreak
one
and
all
had
been
used
in
previous
sermons
he
meditated
and
meditated
but
the
more
he
did
so
the
worse
his
headache
became
and
the
more
irritably
wiry
his
hair
next
time
the
lad
shall
not
tempt
me
he
said
and
savagely
pushed
back
the
cup
of
coffee
and
milk
which
had
grown
cold
the
door
opened
and
kurt
who
had
won
his
point
and
got
a
starched
collar
came
into
the
parlour
smiling
amiably
have
you
slept
well
papa
he
asked
carelessly
the
old
man
threatened
him
with
his
open
hand
i
never
do
it
any
more
on
a
saturday
night
you
young
dog
he
roared
at
him
how
am
i
to
compose
my
sermon
on
sunday
with
a
splitting
head
kurt
perceived
that
his
father
was
not
in
a
humour
to
be
trifled
with
and
poured
himself
out
some
coffee
from
the
big
brown
family
jug
in
silence
the
old
man
shut
up
the
folio
before
him
with
a
furious
bang
at
that
same
moment
a
sombre
female
figure
passed
by
the
casement
a
cloud
of
black
gauze
flapping
behind
her
the
countess
prachwitz
low
muffled
alto
sounded
in
the
outer
hall
the
pastor
pricked
up
his
ears
get
out
with
you
he
commanded
his
son
and
stood
all
expectation
awaiting
the
entrance
of
the
visitor
with
his
brows
drawn
together
in
straight
lines
and
wearing
his
most
scowling
expression
kurt
subdued
with
his
in
one
hand
and
a
buttered
roll
in
the
other
slipped
out
by
a
side
door
he
would
have
given
something
to
catch
a
few
crumbs
of
the
conversation
for
since
his
flirtation
with
little
elly
his
conscience
with
regard
to
halewitz
was
anything
but
easy
the
pastor
and
countess
johanna
were
closeted
together
for
more
than
an
hour
the
organ
strains
began
to
come
from
the
church
and
already
the
stream
of
worshippers
was
thinning
but
the
two
still
continued
to
converse
in
low
eager
tones
the
pastor
wife
had
knocked
twice
warningly
and
had
twice
been
sent
away
at
last
when
the
clock
chimed
nine
they
came
out
into
the
hall
the
countess
with
compressed
lips
and
traces
of
tears
about
her
eyes
the
pastor
with
the
dark
frown
of
the
avenger
upon
his
brows
you
may
depend
on
me
my
lady
he
said
as
he
stood
looming
within
the
doorway
i
will
do
what
lies
in
my
poor
power
to
bring
him
to
penitence
she
gave
the
frau
pastorin
her
hand
and
patted
the
watered
curls
of
the
little
ones
who
stood
round
gaping
up
at
her
then
glided
out
without
bestowing
a
look
on
kurt
my
gown
my
bands
cried
the
old
man
in
a
voice
of
thunder
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
her
and
while
his
wife
who
had
been
eagerly
awaiting
this
command
rushed
to
invest
him
with
the
robes
of
his
spiritual
office
he
murmured
to
himself
with
grim
satisfaction
now
i
have
got
a
subject
aye
and
what
a
subject
old
boy
congratulate
yourself
x
at
the
same
hour
the
halewitz
drew
up
before
the
gateway
of
the
farm
at
wengern
the
party
from
the
castle
were
coming
to
church
to
return
thanks
for
the
master
happy
return
the
two
young
girls
in
their
white
muslins
grandmamma
believed
in
simplicity
of
attire
walked
in
front
their
arms
round
each
other
and
their
faces
grave
leo
followed
with
his
mother
leaning
on
his
arm
he
swung
along
and
glorying
in
the
full
consciousness
of
having
returned
to
a
noble
heritage
his
white
waistcoat
gleamed
like
freshly
fallen
snow
and
the
seals
which
hung
in
festive
array
against
the
slender
roundness
of
his
figure
made
as
he
walked
a
slight
jingle
which
was
pleasing
to
his
ear
and
heightened
his
with
himself
and
the
world
and
what
a
sunday
morning
it
was
the
fields
that
had
been
already
cleared
glittered
like
tapestry
and
the
meadows
where
the
grass
was
beginning
to
recover
from
the
stroke
of
the
scythe
were
spangled
with
a
thousand
dewdrops
the
village
wrapped
in
its
sabbath
calm
lay
in
the
shade
of
its
limes
still
tinged
with
the
lingering
rosiness
of
dawn
everywhere
crooked
sunbeams
danced
on
the
smooth
roadway
and
from
the
cottage
chimneys
curls
of
smoke
rose
gaily
into
the
blue
canopy
where
they
melted
in
shining
wraiths
like
the
vapour
from
sacrificial
altars
sunflowers
and
hollyhocks
bloomed
in
the
villagers
gardens
the
whole
picture
breathed
forth
a
faint
prescience
of
autumn
a
promise
of
harvest
and
enjoyment
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
the
people
who
stood
before
their
doors
bared
their
heads
and
the
children
overcome
with
shy
awe
crept
away
under
the
come
along
to
church
he
called
to
the
men
those
who
are
pious
in
the
morning
are
welcome
to
a
free
in
the
afternoon
he
wanted
every
one
to
rejoice
with
him
and
to
be
as
thankful
to
the
almighty
as
he
was
his
mother
felt
a
soft
pressure
on
her
arm
she
was
walking
beside
him
in
her
black
satin
dress
and
silver
embroidered
lace
shawl
full
of
a
pride
and
joy
too
great
for
words
now
she
looked
up
at
him
and
inquired
gently
what
is
it
my
son
he
bent
down
to
her
and
kissed
her
through
her
veil
on
both
cheeks
silently
she
choked
back
her
tears
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
two
young
girls
in
front
yielded
to
the
same
impulse
and
gave
each
other
a
kiss
looking
round
afterwards
as
if
it
were
a
crime
see
leo
whispered
in
his
mother
ear
they
imitate
their
elders
there
is
so
much
love
in
the
world
that
does
know
what
to
do
to
find
an
outlet
said
she
now
mummy
he
laughed
you
speak
as
if
you
wore
trousers
why
dear
boy
because
that
remark
is
almost
too
apt
to
come
from
any
one
in
petticoats
grandmamma
thought
this
an
abominable
insinuation
and
passing
on
to
speak
of
hertha
she
expressed
her
fear
that
the
way
in
which
he
treated
her
was
not
the
right
one
that
it
had
evidently
damped
her
and
might
alienate
her
from
him
altogether
he
was
going
to
make
some
reply
but
at
that
moment
they
came
within
the
sacred
boundary
which
surrounded
the
small
unpretending
village
churchyard
where
under
the
shadow
of
the
primeval
limes
the
sellenthins
for
centuries
had
found
their
last
a
row
of
mounds
each
enclosed
in
its
simple
iron
railings
ran
along
under
the
whitewashed
church
wall
only
divided
from
it
by
a
narrow
gravel
path
there
was
a
soft
rustling
in
the
boughs
of
the
limes
and
the
deep
tones
of
the
organ
subdued
and
indistinct
coming
through
the
high
round
window
fell
on
leo
ear
involuntarily
he
stood
still
and
folded
his
hands
his
mother
who
divined
his
feelings
withdrew
her
hand
quietly
from
his
arm
and
fell
back
a
few
steps
the
girls
who
had
hurried
on
were
now
out
of
sight
he
felt
his
heart
swell
like
a
flood
within
him
since
he
was
four
years
old
he
had
trodden
this
path
within
the
whitewashed
fence
at
the
gate
of
which
the
village
swains
gathered
and
where
as
of
old
the
with
her
basket
of
loaves
and
the
old
soldier
with
the
and
crouched
on
the
he
had
been
used
to
shake
off
the
dust
and
cobwebs
that
clogged
his
soul
the
high
spirits
and
troubles
of
the
schoolboy
the
youth
defiance
and
war
of
the
senses
the
grown
household
cares
and
imperiousness
aye
and
that
wild
sweet
mysterious
something
which
now
was
done
with
for
ever
all
these
had
been
left
behind
him
as
he
entered
the
churchyard
gates
the
graves
of
his
ancestors
had
ever
sent
a
pure
soothing
thrill
through
his
being
so
that
he
had
come
into
god
house
as
one
absolved
and
purified
and
yet
the
feeling
of
holy
reverence
which
awoke
in
him
now
was
not
comparable
with
anything
that
had
ever
before
appealed
to
his
careless
heart
with
exhortation
and
blessing
he
asked
himself
in
astonishment
how
he
could
all
these
years
have
borne
so
carelessly
the
terrible
dead
weight
on
his
mind
without
doing
violence
to
the
world
or
going
mad
only
now
when
the
burden
had
dropped
off
did
he
know
what
he
had
been
dragging
about
with
him
and
a
sense
of
unutterable
blissful
relief
took
possession
of
him
at
the
thought
that
he
might
in
future
hold
up
his
head
as
a
free
man
he
caught
his
mother
hand
in
his
she
had
been
busying
herself
with
removing
weeds
from
the
foot
of
the
railings
but
now
came
and
stood
beside
him
before
the
last
grave
in
the
row
the
grave
of
leo
father
leo
eberhard
von
sellenthin
woe
to
him
that
coveteth
an
evil
covetousness
to
his
house
that
he
may
set
his
nest
on
high
such
was
the
inscription
which
according
to
the
desire
of
the
deceased
was
carved
on
the
rugged
marble
tombstone
he
had
been
a
powerful
man
irresistible
when
amiable
terrible
in
wrath
he
had
maintained
a
whole
troop
of
mistresses
and
had
allowed
two
magnificent
estates
ellerthal
and
rothwitz
to
pass
into
a
stranger
hands
to
save
as
he
said
the
honour
of
his
house
old
kletzingk
father
and
count
prachwitz
johanna
husband
had
been
his
cronies
it
was
current
gossip
amongst
the
country
folk
that
in
an
hour
of
dissipation
he
had
gambled
away
his
young
and
blooming
eldest
daughter
to
the
count
a
daring
rider
and
a
man
given
up
to
betting
and
before
he
reached
his
seventieth
year
he
had
been
laid
in
his
grave
and
his
neglected
wife
to
whose
share
there
had
fallen
from
time
to
time
only
a
few
crumbs
of
love
from
the
table
of
others
sighed
and
mourned
for
him
still
and
held
his
memory
sacred
mother
and
son
breathed
a
quiet
prayer
and
took
stolen
glances
at
each
other
the
while
she
would
fain
gather
from
his
face
whether
he
had
forgiven
his
father
for
the
sale
of
the
land
he
from
hers
whether
she
still
cherished
love
and
regret
in
her
heart
for
the
dead
and
then
they
both
smiled
i
thank
you
so
much
she
said
softly
caressing
his
arm
i
should
still
have
loved
him
even
if
he
had
left
us
naked
to
beg
by
the
roadside
but
why
do
you
thank
me
he
asked
because
i
can
read
in
your
face
that
you
no
longer
reproach
him
would
it
be
fitting
for
me
to
reproach
him
he
answered
when
i
began
where
he
left
off
but
never
mind
mummy
all
is
going
to
look
up
now
i
have
got
such
a
nice
motto
of
my
own
it
will
help
me
a
lot
even
to
contend
with
the
devil
himself
but
i
would
rather
keep
it
to
myself
and
not
tell
you
what
it
is
for
if
you
knew
how
much
hangs
on
it
you
would
be
sure
to
cry
out
and
wring
your
hands

or
even
ten
years
hence
we
will
talk
of
this
again
and
then
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
if
it
has
answered
they
turned
and
walked
to
the
vestry
where
the
two
girls
were
waiting
for
them
the
squire
family
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
entering
the
church
by
the
vestry
door
the
first
two
rows
of
pews
which
were
cushioned
and
divided
from
the
rest
by
a
carved
oak
screen
were
reserved
for
their
use
the
pastor
must
already
have
gone
into
the
chancel
for
the
vestry
was
empty
leo
had
wanted
to
greet
him
before
service
and
he
was
a
little
put
out
now
that
he
had
not
first
paid
him
a
visit
in
his
own
house
is
johanna
there
he
asked
elly
who
was
peeping
at
the
congregation
through
a
crack
in
the
door
she
started
as
if
she
had
been
caught
committing
a
theft
for
she
had
just
at
that
moment
seen
the
herr
kandidat
who
was
by
this
time
seated
in
the
parsonage
pew
what
the
matter
asked
leo
whereupon
hertha
threw
her
arm
round
her
waist
protectingly
and
gave
him
a
hostile
look
allons
he
said
smiling
and
then
set
his
face
for
he
knew
that
as
he
came
into
the
church
the
gaze
of
all
his
tenants
would
be
fastened
upon
him
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
johanna
dark
eyes
with
a
peculiar
light
in
them
she
fixed
them
on
him
unflinchingly
he
gave
her
a
careless
indifferent
nod
but
took
care
that
the
girls
as
well
as
his
mother
should
fill
the
places
in
the
pew
between
him
and
his
eldest
sister
he
had
no
wish
to
be
disturbed
in
his
worship
by
the
near
proximity
of
the
gloomy
inscrutable
face
the
pastor
had
mounted
the
pulpit
and
thrown
himself
on
his
knees
with
his
head
resting
against
the
edge
of
the
pulpit
cushion
his
face
remained
buried
in
his
arms
and
only
the
dome
of
his
skull
flashed
down
on
the
congregation
leo
gave
him
a
scrutinizing
upward
glance
and
murmured
to
himself
with
a
sly
smile
he
feeling
sick
i
bet
just
above
the
worthy
man
crown
a
wisp
of
hair
stood
on
end
and
like
a
reed
in
the
wind
flopped
hither
and
thither
leo
father
used
to
gauge
the
sabbatical
alcoholic
condition
of
the
stout
minister
by
this
unmistakable
sign
the
knowledge
had
early
descended
from
father
to
son
and
when
his
old
tutor
was
in
a
good
humour
leo
had
many
a
time
teased
him
about
it
wonder
how
he
come
through
the
ordeal
thought
he
for
of
course
the
old
fellow
would
have
to
refer
to
the
of
his
patron
and
send
up
a
prayer
of
thanksgiving
to
heaven
he
leaned
back
comfortably
in
his
seat
twirled
his
thumbs
and
felt
prepared
to
sit
through
cheerfully
the
service
of
praise
which
seemed
especially
ordained
to
glorify
himself
the
sunbeams
danced
everywhere
casting
little
shafts
of
red
green
and
yellow
light
on
the
steps
of
the
altar
the
desks
of
the
choir
and
the
tiles
of
the
floor
illuminating
the
grey
faces
of
the
old
and
making
the
bright
colouring
of
the
young
more
radiant
they
climbed
up
the
leaden
and
sat
laughing
on
the
the
branches
of
the
limes
swayed
gently
against
the
windows
as
if
they
too
wished
to
greet
the
returned
squire
and
when
the
leaves
swept
the
there
was
a
rustling
and
murmuring
like
children
whispering
to
each
other
before
falling
asleep
a
peaceful
dreamy
atmosphere
of
home
reigned
in
the
quiet
little
church
pastor
brenckenberg
lifted
his
head
from
his
bloated
countenance
his
eyes
full
of
gloom
and
obstinacy
surveyed
the
congregation
they
passed
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
they
would
have
liked
to
devour
one
after
the
other
when
they
reached
leo
they
remained
riveted
what
have
you
taken
into
your
old
pate
the
latter
said
to
himself
and
acknowledged
the
tyrant
with
a
friendly
wink
but
it
was
not
returned
with
any
sign
of
recognition
the
prayers
came
to
an
end
the
epistle
followed
uneventfully
but
in
the
big
man
voice
there
was
a
growling
undertone
which
reminded
leo
of
his
worst
boyish
scrapes
in
the
days
when
that
great
red
puffy
hand
wielded
the
birch
over
him
beloved
in
the
lord
the
pastor
began
his
discourse
making
his
ten
meet
as
he
spoke
last
night
i
had
a
curious
and
terrifying
dream
yes
yes
i
dare
say
thought
leo
why
drink
so
much
beer
on
saturday
night
old
boy
i
dreamt
that
i
was
nathan
that
prophet
of
the
old
testament
who
walked
the
earth
in
the
days
of
the
godly
king
david
and
to
whom
it
was
granted
to
see
the
greatest
glory
of
the
people
of
israel
well
i
was
this
prophet
he
made
a
pause
and
blew
his
nose
when
he
had
straightened
himself
again
his
eyes
rolled
so
threateningly
in
their
red
sockets
that
elly
who
sat
next
to
leo
involuntarily
edged
nearer
him
there
appeared
to
me
the
lord
the
lord
of
sabaoth
at
the
mention
of
whose
very
name
we
all
shudder
he
it
was
and
no
other
his
beard
was
of
flames
his
eyes
were
burning
suns
a
mantle
of
fire
hung
from
his
shoulders
and
nearly
covered
the
whole
horizon
with
its
folds
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
trembled
have
any
of
you
ever
seen
me
tremble
not
one
of
you
but
beloved
brethren
at
the
sight
of
the
lord
i
trembled
for
that
was
no
small
thing
one
of
you
in
wengern
who
idle
all
day
under
the
and
play
the
fool
all
night
in
the
taverns
would
simply
be
blown
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
if
the
lord
deigned
to
reveal
himself
to
any
such
beggarly
hound
a
good
beginning
thought
leo
who
knew
this
little
joke
of
old
and
he
chuckled
to
himself
but
the
glances
which
the
old
man
again
cast
on
him
seemed
to
promise
him
nothing
pleasant
and
the
lord
spoke
to
me
his
voice
was
like
the
roar
of
the
sea
when
a
storm
is
raging
he
spake
get
thee
gone
to
david
thy
king
and
my
servant
he
has
done
evil
in
my
sight
and
his
deed
stinks
before
heaven
has
he
done
dear
god
i
asked
has
he
done
shame
on
you
you
priest
if
your
eyes
have
not
seen
he
has
seduced
uriah
wife
and
uriah
the
hittite
he
hath
suffered
to
be
put
to
death
at
the
hands
of
his
captain
joab
before
the
gates
of
thebez
so
that
she
should
tarry
with
him
and
live
as
his
wedded
wife
dear
god
said
i
is
an
ugly
story
but
thou
knowest
how
here
on
earth
every
deadly
sin
is
permitted
to
the
great
robbery
murder
adultery
bearing
false
witness
and
other
crimes
but
the
poor
and
humble
the
peasants
and
in
particular
the
peasants
sons
may
not
commit
the
smallest
sin
not
even
play
with
their
in
church
of
which
those
sitting
on
the
back
benches
may
make
a
note
a
solemn
silence
followed
only
from
the
bottom
of
the
church
came
a
rustling
sound
like
some
one
hurriedly
putting
things
away
leo
smile
died
he
let
his
folded
hands
drop
from
the
white
waistcoat
and
fidgeted
uneasily
the
old
man
went
on
what
is
more
dear
god
said
i
to
the
lord
easily
i
might
come
to
lose
my
office
of
prophet
and
have
to
go
begging
in
the
streets
for
the
kings
of
this
world
do
not
like
to
be
told
the
truth
but
the
lord
spake
not
what
thou
doest
is
done
in
my
name
therewith
he
disappeared
but
i
girded
up
my
loins
and
set
forth
to
journey
to
the
palace
of
the
king
there
i
expected
to
find
king
david
weeping
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
such
as
he
has
described
in
the
beautiful
psalm
of
repentance
which
of
course
you
all
would
know
if
you
did
not
prefer
spending
sunday
afternoon
shooting
at
the
instead
of
staying
at
home
piously
reading
your
bibles
but
what
do
you
think
met
my
eyes
the
king
was
seated
at
meat
in
splendid
raiment
laughing
and
jocund
a
bottle
of
sweet
wine
before
him
and
beside
him
on
the
right
hand
was
his
beloved
bathsheba
for
that
was
the
woman
name
he
had
grown
stout
and
he
raised
his
glass
to
drink
to
me
therewith
he
called
out
to
me
you
priestling
what
brought
you
to
me
once
more
for
like
all
the
great
ones
of
the
earthy
he
delighted
to
mock
at
the
servants
of
the
lord
although
they
ca
do
without
them
if
they
want
all
their
people
to
obey
them
even
such
scum
as
have
gone
to
sleep
again
in
this
church
but
i
knew
no
fear
for
the
spirit
of
the
lord
was
within
me
and
i
rent
my
garments
and
cried
woe
unto
thee
my
king
what
hast
thou
done
leo
could
not
be
in
doubt
while
the
pastor
almost
shrieked
forth
these
last
words
till
they
echoed
shrilly
through
the
church
his
small
rolling
eyes
were
fixed
piercingly
and
angrily
upon
him
what
did
it
mean
was
there
another
person
in
the
world
who
knew
could
the
secret
have
found
its
way
from
the
grave
where
it
lay
buried
to
pop
out
of
this
old
man
brain
but
i
threw
myself
on
the
ground
and
tore
my
hair
he
continued
with
fresh
zeal
and
caught
at
his
thin
locks
with
both
hands
woe
i
cried
hast
shamed
and
degraded
thy
kingly
office
thou
hast
rebelled
against
the
lord
commands
a
fire
from
heaven
shall
consume
thee
thy
memory
shall
be
wiped
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
which
thou
hast
polluted
with
thy
lusts
thus
i
cried
and
a
shudder
shook
the
sinful
body
of
the
king
at
the
same
instant
leo
felt
a
sensation
of
hot
and
cold
water
running
down
his
neck
too
absurd
he
thought
grasping
the
rough
ledge
of
the
pew
can
an
old
sot
like
this
give
me
qualms
of
conscience
art
thou
raving
about
stupid
priest
the
king
made
reply
you
think
my
conscience
will
suffer
qualms
through
you
leo
started
to
the
exact
words
the
preacher
seemed
to
have
divined
his
thoughts
and
he
took
hold
of
his
bottle
of
wine
to
throw
it
at
my
head
but
the
majesty
of
the
lord
fell
on
me
his
poor
servant
so
that
my
aspect
was
terrible
and
filled
him
with
fear
his
pride
fell
away
and
he
stuttered
forth
quite
downcast
shall
i
do
to
become
once
more
the
dear
child
of
my
dear
lord
god
shall
so
come
to
pass
said
i
thou
repentest
thou
shalt
moan
and
beat
thy
breast
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
because
of
thy
fault
for
it
stinks
before
heaven
so
speaketh
the
lord
thy
god
leo
looked
down
the
man
above
him
was
half
prophet
half
mountebank
but
he
was
right
the
deed
stank
before
heaven
no
jesting
could
alter
the
fact
and
the
king
grew
angry
and
called
bathsheba
to
him
who
stood
shaking
in
his
presence
thee
gone
thou
temptress
for
i
am
sick
of
thee
it
was
for
thy
sake
that
i
went
astray
into
the
path
of
sin
and
can
no
more
be
redeemed
therefrom
by
heavenly
grace
thou
canst
marry
another
man
and
no
more
come
in
my
sight
and
bathsheba
who
was
very
beautiful
and
from
crown
to
heel
a
courtesan
began
to
weep
and
wail
and
cover
her
face
but
i
came
between
them
and
i
said
her
not
out
for
she
is
the
companion
of
thy
sin
thou
shalt
repent
for
her
as
thou
repentest
for
thyself
thou
shalt
not
part
from
her
so
that
thy
sin
shall
never
be
forgotten
only
in
that
way
canst
thou
conciliate
the
lord
god
who
is
eternally
to
be
praised
amen
when
will
this
come
to
an
end
thought
leo
and
cast
a
defiant
glance
of
inquiry
up
at
the
pulpit
to
meet
the
pastor
eyes
which
flamed
like
swords
beneath
his
grizzled
brows
then
a
great
longing
came
over
the
heart
of
the
king
he
sank
on
his
knees
and
cried
lord
hearken
unto
me
in
my
wretchedness
but
the
lord
heard
him
not
and
his
wrath
was
written
on
the
heavens
in
letters
of
fire
and
in
a
voice
of
thunder
he
cried
down
on
the
earth
in
his
wrath
so
that
the
mountains
shook
and
the
dried
up
between
their
banks
and
the
king
besought
me
saying
nathan
help
me
pray
to
the
lord
god
of
sabaoth
so
that
he
turneth
his
wrath
away
from
me
and
no
more
visiteth
it
on
my
head
thereupon
i
sank
on
my
knees
and
prayed
also
lord
i
have
ever
loved
him
as
a
little
lad
he
crouched
between
my
knees
to
hear
thy
holy
word
for
the
first
time
from
my
lips
he
was
truthful
and
frank
and
his
laugh
was
like
a
peal
of
bells
thy
sunshine
lay
on
his
curls
so
that
he
was
the
heart
idol
of
all
who
looked
on
him
lord
lord
was
in
his
eyes
and
innocence
in
his
white
soul
he
promised
to
be
a
great
light
as
thy
appointed
ruler
of
the
people
when
thou
didst
anoint
him
as
thy
representative
on
earth
with
the
sacred
oil
of
the
kingdom
of
israel
leo
stared
down
at
the
ground
he
could
no
longer
endure
his
old
tutor
fiery
glance
the
red
tiles
of
the
floor
flashed
before
his
eyes
like
lakes
of
blood
not
a
sound
broke
the
stillness
in
the
crowded
little
church
the
grim
power
of
this
biblical
eloquence
stirred
and
affected
all
even
the
most
on
the
dull
faces
of
the
peasants
and
labourers
there
was
a
look
of
intense
and
painful
excitement
it
was
as
if
every
one
felt
that
god
through
the
mouth
of
his
minister
was
in
this
hour
passing
judgment
on
a
sinner
but
no
how
could
they
feel
this
why
even
in
the
souls
of
those
sitting
nearest
to
the
judged
man
no
suspicion
had
dawned
as
to
whom
the
thunderbolts
were
being
hurled
at
grandmamma
gazed
up
in
uncomprehending
calm
at
the
foaming
zealot
hertha
measured
him
her
head
uplifted
boldly
with
disapproving
eyes
elly
cast
a
gentle
timid
glance
from
time
to
time
at
the
parsonage
pew
whence
kurt
brenckenberg
ogled
her
as
much
as
the
sacred
place
and
the
presence
of
the
august
preacher
in
the
pulpit
would
permit
johanna
had
flung
herself
on
the
hassock
and
kept
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
she
continued
kneeling
or
rather
prostrating
herself
there
motionless
save
for
the
convulsive
tremour
which
now
and
again
shook
her
tall
frame
as
if
she
were
suppressing
a
secret
sob
the
old
pastor
also
had
thrown
himself
on
his
knees
in
fervid
wrestling
he
flung
up
his
hands
towards
heaven
and
tears
streamed
over
his
swollen
face
in
a
voice
half
strangled
by
weeping
he
continued
thou
not
seen
him
on
horseback
lord
lord
my
god
riding
in
magnificence
at
the
head
of
thy
troops
as
he
went
forth
to
fight
the
amalekites
the
helmet
on
his
head
flashing
with
gold
and
jewels
the
sword
that
he
wielded
for
the
greatness
of
thy
kingdom
like
lightning
in
his
hand
thou
hast
heard
him
playing
on
the
harp
sweetly
singing
to
thy
praise
and
glory
thou
hast
heard
how
he
sang
and
played
on
harp
and
psalter
to
bring
home
the
ark
of
the
covenant
to
build
thee
a
house
of
splendour
of
ivory
wrought
about
with
precious
stones
hast
thou
forgotten
the
good
he
hath
done
unto
his
tribe
and
the
people
he
hath
reigned
over
how
wisely
he
filled
the
offices
of
state
and
rejoiced
before
thee
o
lord
for
the
sake
of
the
love
thou
bore
for
him
for
the
sake
of
the
love
he
bears
towards
us
i
in
the
dust
beseech
thee
o
god
to
pardon
him
i
will
neither
eat
nor
drink
and
i
will
go
bareheaded
at
midday
and
will
walk
with
my
naked
soles
on
bricks
till
thou
hast
bowed
thine
ear
to
my
petition
and
renewed
thy
covenant
with
david
thy
servant
and
my
master
he
ceased
and
wiped
the
tears
which
were
rolling
into
his
mouth
here
and
there
from
the
benches
came
a
moan
one
old
woman
whimpered
as
if
she
were
being
pricked
by
spears
sobbing
was
general
throughout
the
congregation
kurt
brenckenberg
looked
round
on
the
display
of
emotion
smiling
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
then
made
eyes
at
elly
meanwhile
the
moment
had
come
for
grandmamma
to
produce
her
only
five
minutes
afterwards
she
was
fast
asleep
leo
sat
cowering
in
his
seat
he
felt
as
if
a
heavy
cold
stone
rested
on
his
head
so
that
his
neck
involuntarily
bent
under
the
burden
his
breast
seemed
to
contract
he
fumbled
nervously
with
the
white
waistcoat
which
still
gleamed
as
immaculately
fresh
as
in
the
early
morning
sunshine
but
to
his
distorted
vision
there
were
now
daubs
of
yellow
dirt
upon
it
he
felt
as
if
he
must
defend
himself
or
at
any
rate
speak
to
some
human
being
so
he
bent
down
to
elly
and
whispered
with
a
faint
smile
the
old
fellow
makes
it
warm
for
us
with
his
curses
elly
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
with
big
vacant
eyes
and
then
turned
to
her
again
the
pastor
resumed
his
petition
his
exhortations
became
more
and
more
fervid
his
voice
more
and
more
broken
with
tears
and
the
whole
time
his
eyes
never
left
leo
face
even
if
it
had
not
been
so
perfectly
natural
on
this
occasion
for
the
dependent
parson
to
refer
in
his
discourse
to
the
powerful
church
patron
and
landowner
there
could
have
been
no
manner
of
doubt
for
whom
his
sermon
of
vengeance
and
penitence
was
intended
but
outwardly
at
least
leo
was
on
his
guard
against
betraying
the
horrid
suspicion
which
long
since
had
become
a
certainty
in
his
heart
the
words
of
the
peasant
orator
like
waves
of
flame
rolled
over
him
rising
and
falling
with
deadening
regularity
till
at
last
they
filled
and
oppressed
his
brain
yet
he
still
fought
with
all
his
might
to
master
the
tormenting
thoughts
rising
within
him
to
trample
them
down
with
brutal
scorn
but
it
was
in
vain
the
pictures
of
his
vanished
youth
which
his
whilom
tutor
skilfully
interwove
with
his
scriptural
phantasies
were
too
forcibly
driven
home
for
his
relaxed
soul
to
resist
them
and
then
suddenly
he
started
as
if
a
whip
had
lashed
him
the
word
jonathan
descended
from
overhead
uttered
in
a
tone
that
was
alike
caressing
and
threatening
he
knew
why
the
old
pastor
leaned
his
bulky
form
far
over
the
edge
of
the
pulpit
as
if
he
would
have
delighted
to
fly
at
the
unrepentant
sinner
throat
knew
well
why
his
fat
fingers
pointed
at
him
why
the
plump
bull
throat
twisted
and
craned
in
demoniacal
contortions
the
zealot
had
now
played
his
last
trump
and
would
have
liked
to
strengthen
the
effect
with
the
power
of
his
fists
but
this
he
dared
not
do
jonathan
the
mere
mention
of
that
name
had
been
sufficient
to
conjure
up
before
leo
mental
eye
the
vision
of
his
friend
in
the
of
an
accusing
angel
he
gazed
at
him
with
his
luminous
eyes
he
the
betrayed
and
deceived
and
between
the
thunder
claps
of
the
brenckenberg
lungs
his
voice
sad
and
low
asked
perpetually
why
hast
thou
done
this
thing
then
was
heard
a
cry
from
a
woman
mouth
a
gurgle
of
fear
johanna
had
fainted
enveloped
in
her
heavy
black
veil
she
lay
a
motionless
heap
on
the
red
tiles
in
the
shadow
of
the
pew
xi
the
drive
home
was
silent
and
depressing
and
so
was
the
midday
meal
which
followed
leo
wrestled
in
his
mind
with
conjectures
and
resolves
it
seemed
certain
that
some
connection
existed
between
johanna
and
the
old
pastor
denunciatory
sermon
the
mystery
must
be
cleared
up
it
was
an
obligation
that
he
owed
his
house
as
usual
the
eldest
sister
did
not
appear
at
table
so
at
dessert
he
sent
hertha
to
ask
if
she
would
see
him
hertha
brought
back
word
that
mamma
did
not
feel
quite
equal
to
receiving
him
then
but
in
an
time
she
hoped
that
she
might
be
well
enough
without
waiting
till
grace
was
said
he
rose
and
strode
into
the
garden
which
lay
gasping
in
the
blazing
noonday
heat
the
roses
languished
on
their
stems
the
lazy
carps
sunned
themselves
on
the
surface
of
the
pond
a
draught
of
hot
air
came
from
the
fallen
pyramid
whose
cracked
gold
letters
commemorating
the
heroic
deeds
of
a
sellentine
ancestor
caught
the
sun
like
panes
of
glass
had
to
get
himself
out
of
many
a
tight
corner
leo
thought
and
resolved
that
he
would
let
no
furious
priest
bully
him
in
future
the
dull
oppressive
weight
in
his
head
dispersed
once
more
his
plucky
defiant
humour
bubbled
up
he
looked
at
the
clock
half
an
hour
just
time
in
which
to
smoke
a
cigar
he
threw
himself
on
a
bench
full
in
the
baking
sun
and
let
the
blue
clouds
curl
about
him
enjoying
the
warm
thrill
which
trickled
along
his
limbs
but
still
johanna
image
blurred
by
tears
would
not
vanish
he
had
of
old
regarded
her
with
a
kind
of
proud
respect
and
had
always
esteemed
it
as
a
happy
privilege
when
she
had
made
him
the
confidant
of
her
strange
introspective
thoughts
and
though
he
had
delighted
to
hold
up
to
ridicule
the
extravagant
enthusiasm
with
which
ulrich
in
his
gymnasium
days
had
raved
about
the
serious
playmate
in
his
heart
he
too
had
thought
her
the
most
sublime
of
female
creatures
and
the
day
after
the
ceremony
in
the
temple
of
friendship
when
he
and
ulrich
had
taken
their
vow
to
be
friends
for
life
they
had
secretly
rowed
johanna
over
to
the
island
that
she
as
a
kind
of
priestess
might
sanctify
what
to
them
was
more
sacred
than
anything
else
in
the
world
he
let
these
pictures
of
an
intimate
affection
pass
before
him
till
three
jangling
strokes
from
the
castle
tower
roused
him
into
a
sitting
position
johanna
apartments
were
on
the
first
floor
close
to
the
desolate
suite
no
one
answered
his
knocks
and
he
walked
in
a
big
bare
room
met
his
eye
it
was
in
owing
to
the
closed
shutters
and
polished
tables
and
stiff
chairs
were
apparently
arranged
at
regular
intervals
along
the
walls
on
which
hung
as
large
as
life
pictures
of
scriptural
subjects
and
alphabets
an
atmosphere
of
poverty
and
dirt
that
abominable
odour
so
offensive
to
aristocratic
nostrils
lingered
in
this
room
even
on
sundays
and
met
him
pungently
as
he
entered
it
this
then
was
the
widely
known
which
turned
halewitz
day
by
day
into
a
kindergarten
institution
for
the
poor
the
room
was
empty
but
through
an
opening
in
the
folds
of
the
partition
he
saw
his
sister
in
the
next
apartment
leaning
almost
lying
back
with
closed
eyes
in
an
armchair
quivering
bluish
shafts
of
light
zigzagged
across
the
dusky
floor
one
of
these
fell
on
her
sunken
face
and
brightly
illumined
the
hair
which
she
generally
wore
hidden
under
her
black
veil
he
stood
still
and
looked
at
her
contemplatively
he
studied
the
hollows
on
the
haggard
cheeks
the
at
the
relaxed
corners
of
the
mouth
and
that
hard
straight
line
running
from
chin
to
throat
the
autumnal
sign
which
no
art
can
eradicate
a
shiver
ran
through
him
what
must
her
life
have
been
since
as
the
young
bride
of
a
gay
cavalier
she
went
out
into
the
world
that
she
should
have
come
back
a
faded
wreck
at
little
more
than
thirty
years
of
age
to
bury
herself
alive
in
this
living
grave
a
mere
sister
of
charity
with
no
interest
outside
the
wretched
scrofulous
children
of
the
peasantry
he
pulled
the
aside
a
curious
scent
of
heliotrope
and
strong
hartshorn
was
wafted
towards
him
she
had
not
heard
his
footstep
till
now
and
slowly
opened
her
tired
eyes
which
directly
she
saw
who
it
was
took
on
that
fixed
clairvoyant
expression
that
had
made
them
so
terrible
to
him
some
of
his
old
youthful
respect
for
her
came
back
momentarily
so
that
he
needed
to
give
himself
a
slight
reminder
before
he
could
resume
his
manner
of
easy
defiance
i
have
come
to
talk
seriously
to
you
he
said
frowning
as
he
placed
a
chair
not
quite
opposite
her
so
that
the
corner
of
the
table
was
still
between
them
she
drew
herself
slowly
erect
and
pushed
the
leather
cushion
against
which
her
head
had
been
resting
lower
to
support
her
back
i
have
been
expecting
you
dear
leo
she
said
ever
since
that
day
we
met
again
you
must
have
been
saying
to
yourself
all
the
time
that
it
was
not
the
same
between
us
as
it
used
to
be
yet
you
have
not
come
for
an
explanation
it
is
your
own
fault
that
you
have
had
to
carry
about
with
you
the
consciousness
of
being
estranged
from
your
sister
but
all
the
same
you
have
managed
to
go
your
way
laughing
and
whistling
that
is
the
first
thing
i
have
to
reproach
you
with
he
felt
his
heart
harden
under
her
words
did
she
want
to
impress
upon
him
the
superiority
of
her
mind
over
his
own
and
as
a
sign
that
he
was
not
the
man
to
be
easily
intimidated
he
took
his
chair
twirled
it
three
times
on
its
castors
then
seated
himself
upon
it
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
back
you
will
permit
me
to
make
myself
comfortable
i
trust
he
said
one
persuasive
arguments
are
not
so
likely
to
be
effective
if
one
begins
too
ceremoniously
a
haughty
lowering
of
her
lids
showed
him
that
she
was
not
inclined
to
tolerate
his
roughness
without
protest
oh
please
she
said
do
put
any
restraint
on
yourself
because
of
me
why
should
you
you
have
accustomed
the
others
to
expect
the
manners
of
the
bar
at
halewitz
at
halewitz
the
manners
which
i
approve
shall
not
be
criticised
dear
hannah
he
replied
and
if
they
seem
too
coarse
for
you
i
advise
you
to
withdraw
to
our
aristocratic
where
you
will
not
be
in
the
least
troubled
by
them
does
that
mean
leo
that
you
will
drive
me
and
my
stepdaughter
from
under
your
roof
it
means
hannah
that
i
will
be
master
in
my
own
house
and
that
i
have
no
desire
to
let
my
temper
be
spoilt
by
the
whims
of
parsons
and
women
for
my
good
temper
is
very
necessary
to
me
more
so
than
you
are
she
folded
her
hands
what
has
come
to
you
leo
she
cried
staring
at
him
he
laughed
in
her
face
come
to
me
nothing
except
that
i
am
now
an
ordinary
fellow
who
intends
to
do
his
work
in
life
without
being
dictated
to
by
any
woman
sister
or
any
one
else
you
are
well
satisfied
with
yourself
she
asked
as
you
are
perfectly
so
long
as
i
am
left
unmolested
you
positively
are
aware
of
no
fault
nothing
that
you
would
like
to
obliterate
from
your
memory
ha
ha
he
exclaimed
now
i
know
what
you
are
driving
at
well
i
am
in
the
mood
to
let
you
preach
so
fire
away
she
cast
her
shadowed
eyes
in
a
heavenward
direction
oh
do
turn
up
the
whites
of
your
eyes
over
me
he
added
i
can
assure
you
i
and
the
almighty
are
on
excellent
terms
his
scoffing
tone
appeared
to
wound
her
deeply
she
put
her
hands
before
her
face
and
leaned
back
in
her
chair
trembling
his
mothers
advice
occurred
to
him
he
saw
now
that
he
ought
to
have
made
more
allowance
for
the
excitable
condition
of
her
nerves
and
was
vexed
with
himself
for
having
been
so
rude
hannah
he
entreated
in
a
voice
full
of
kindness
be
reasonable
let
us
talk
freely
and
openly
straight
from
the
heart
as
we
used
to
do
in
old
days
if
we
are
frank
with
each
other
things
must
be
cleared
up
a
quarrel
between
you
and
me
is
a
pure
caprice
come
hannah
tell
me
what
is
the
grudge
you
bear
against
me
she
let
her
hands
fall
from
her
face
every
drop
of
blood
receded
from
her
cheeks
and
brow
then
as
she
raised
both
arms
as
if
shielding
herself
from
him
she
cried
in
a
voice
from
which
all
the
torment
of
a
thousand
sleepless
nights
seemed
to
break
forth
leo
she
was
your
mistress
now
he
needed
his
utmost
strength
to
parry
the
attack
i
understand
you
my
dear
he
said
shrugging
his
shoulders
with
affected
coolness
are
you
going
to
deny
it
leo
she
asked
he
looked
hard
at
her
full
of
suspicion
yet
after
all
what
could
she
know
a
rumour
from
the
gossip
round
neighbouring
may
have
reached
her
ears
which
had
become
a
fixed
idea
in
her
pondering
brain
and
now
seemed
to
her
an
actual
fact
that
must
be
it
it
could
be
otherwise
yet
he
resolved
at
all
events
to
sound
her
cautiously
look
here
my
dear
child
he
said
nothing
is
further
from
my
thoughts
than
to
pose
to
you
as
a
saint
i
am
and
have
been
all
my
life
a
piece
of
goods
but
i
assure
you
i
the
slightest
notion
to
which
of
my
foolish
affairs
all
are
over
now
you
are
referring
i
am
not
speaking
of
affairs
but
of
adultery
she
answered
indeed
is
it
possible
he
inquired
still
schooling
himself
to
scorn
that
is
almost
worthy
of
the
holy
mouth
of
our
old
pastor
brenckenberg
and
that
leads
me
to
a
conclusion
at
which
i
have
slowly
arrived
that
you
have
had
a
hand
in
the
lamentations
he
poured
out
over
me
you
have
only
just
arrived
at
that
conclusion
she
exclaimed
you
know
i
am
a
little
dense
he
replied
with
a
laugh
but
a
cold
sweat
had
broken
out
on
his
forehead
she
gazed
at
him
seeking
to
find
a
passport
into
his
soul
you
want
to
spare
her
she
said
with
a
weary
smile
of
contempt
it
is
hardly
necessary
now
i
let
myself
be
deceived
by
her
long
enough
she
knew
well
how
to
play
the
innocent
with
those
eyes
through
her
consummate
acting
she
ruined
you
all
the
perfidious
woman
she
had
clasped
the
arm
of
the
chair
with
her
thin
hands
and
sat
erect
as
if
preparing
for
a
spring
leo
hung
greedily
on
her
lips
she
understands
the
art
of
hating
he
thought
and
his
heart
beat
loud
and
then
without
further
inquiry
on
his
part
she
told
him
how
she
had
discovered
the
secret
it
was
about
two
years
ago
when
felicitas
was
already
engaged
that
she
had
found
her
one
day
in
his
study
rummaging
in
his
the
key
of
which
was
generally
in
ulrich
keeping
and
when
she
saw
that
she
was
caught
she
went
down
on
her
knees
and
had
besought
johanna
not
to
betray
her
it
was
because
she
could
no
longer
endure
the
thought
of
her
fiancé
sitting
at
the
same
which
contained
her
letters
that
she
had
searched
for
them
her
letters
and
to
whom
so
it
had
come
to
light
the
fool
leo
burst
forth
she
might
have
known
that
her
letters
were
burnt
long
ago
his
sister
seemed
to
have
awaited
this
incautious
exclamation
you
confess
then
she
said
pleased
he
hesitated
confess
there
is
nothing
to
confess
a
few
scrawls
belonging
to
the
time
of
that
flirtation
which
went
on
under
your
eyes
beyond
that
i
never
had
a
line
from
her
she
looked
at
him
again
with
her
tired
smile
you
are
stubborn
dear
friend
she
said
your
whilom
mistress
capitulated
at
once
she
did
me
the
doubtful
honour
of
making
me
her
confidante
but
the
was
not
to
my
taste
the
very
next
moment
i
showed
her
the
door
leo
saw
at
last
that
his
secret
for
good
or
ill
was
in
his
possession
to
deny
any
more
would
be
sheer
madness
and
instead
of
using
your
knowledge
to
help
and
to
save
he
said
grinding
his
teeth
you
must
needs
rush
and
confide
it
to
the
bosom
of
our
old
private
chaplain
and
through
that
crooked
channel
try
to
ruin
your
brother
honourable
name
and
peace
of
mind
eh
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
he
knew
it
long
ago
she
responded
how
from
whom
from
rhaden
himself
the
hound
the
hound
he
and
i
were
sworn
to
secrecy
he
has
broken
his
vows
to
the
dead
do
you
deserve
anything
else
he
leapt
up
hannah
he
said
controlling
himself
with
difficulty
i
should
advise
you
to
adopt
another
tone
or
else
i
may
forget
that
we
are
the
same
flesh
and
blood
alas
that
we
are
she
replied
folding
her
hands
a
voice
cried
within
him
jeer
at
her
overwhelm
her
with
your
scorn
and
contempt
but
his
victorious
courage
had
forsaken
him
he
could
only
utter
a
hoarse
jarring
laugh
her
eye
rested
on
him
hard
and
pitiless
and
he
felt
a
narrowing
of
his
heart
as
if
iron
hoops
gradually
encircled
it
in
his
despair
he
bethought
him
of
the
covenant
of
friendship
in
which
johanna
had
played
the
part
of
priestess
is
he
not
your
friend
as
well
as
mine
he
asked
why
did
you
not
warn
him
it
was
in
your
power
to
avert
the
evil
why
did
you
do
it
a
smile
of
hovered
about
her
lips
that
is
my
concern
on
that
point
i
refuse
to
answer
you
she
said
it
dawned
upon
him
faintly
that
here
somewhere
was
the
key
that
might
solve
the
riddle
presented
by
her
distraught
mind
but
before
he
could
put
the
thought
into
words
it
had
eluded
him
and
what
of
our
covenant
he
stammered
our
old
covenant
that
was
broken
long
ago
she
answered
while
in
her
bitterness
a
dark
flush
mounted
to
her
cheek
it
was
broken
when
you
both
put
me
aside
to
play
with
that
white
kitten
neither
of
you
troubled
your
heads
about
me
then
and
when
i
became
engaged
no
one
asked
me
why
i
did
it
even
took
no
interest
and
what
i
have
suffered
as
wife
of
an
adventurer
who
knows
or
cares
or
how
he
bundled
me
about
from
racecourse
to
and
from
to
racecourse
ah
what
a
life
that
was
but
why
do
i
talk
of
myself
i
too
only
got
what
i
deserved
what
have
you
to
reproach
yourself
with
he
asked
she
bit
her
lips
and
brooded
every
one
of
us
has
something
to
repent
leo
she
said
after
a
pause
i
as
well
as
you
all
day
and
all
night
i
am
repenting
without
ceasing
it
is
my
right
no
one
can
deprive
me
of
it
it
is
the
only
way
in
which
i
can
repair
in
some
measure
my
ruined
life
and
yet
you
were
able
to
endure
that
man
he
inquired
was
i
forced
to
she
replied
if
i
had
left
him
we
should
all
have
been
disgraced
when
he
died
in
a
hospital
i
could
not
be
with
him
for
i
was
travelling
about
in
order
to
redeem
a
cheque
that
he
had
forged
johanne
wrath
at
the
conduct
of
the
scoundrel
who
had
wormed
himself
into
his
family
seized
him
so
hotly
that
for
a
moment
everything
swam
before
him
tearless
with
her
tired
smile
she
looked
up
at
him
till
now
no
human
soul
has
heard
of
it
she
continued
so
you
have
no
need
to
be
ashamed
of
your
sister
he
stretched
out
both
his
hands
towards
her
forgive
me
hannah
if
only
i
had
guessed
leave
me
alone
she
answered
pushing
his
hands
aside
we
are
not
talking
about
myself
it
is
only
better
that
you
should
know
with
whom
you
have
to
deal
and
in
case
you
should
feel
inclined
to
laugh
at
me
again
because
i
trust
in
jesus
my
saviour
a
faint
gleam
shot
from
her
eyes
towards
the
crucifix
i
may
as
well
tell
you
how
i
found
him
at
the
time
that
i
was
degraded
and
polluted
by
contact
with
that
man
when
i
could
think
eat
or
sleep
for
loathing
i
sought
a
place
where
i
could
cry
out
my
heart
in
peace
i
slunk
about
like
an
outcast
seeking
and
seeking
and
could
find
no
haven
till
one
day
i
saw
a
church
door
standing
open
and
went
in
there
no
one
persecuted
me
there
i
found
home
and
husband
the
spouse
who
did
not
strike
or
outrage
me
who
himself
had
suffered
as
i
suffered
who
smiled
down
at
me
from
the
cross
when
i
clung
to
his
poor
bleeding
feet
will
you
blame
me
for
having
gone
to
him
again
and
again
he
gave
her
a
softened
glance
certainly
he
could
never
again
mock
at
her
pious
exercises
but
i
was
not
then
quite
what
you
see
me
now
she
went
on
i
only
realised
to
the
full
how
utterly
alone
i
was
in
the
world
when
that
person
who
now
reigns
at
uhlenfelde
confessed
all
to
me
after
that
i
wrestled
on
my
knees
whole
nights
through
i
prayed
to
god
saying
take
me
as
a
sacrifice
let
me
expiate
the
shame
which
he
has
brought
on
our
heads
who
are
nearest
to
him
and
love
him
do
what
thou
wilt
with
me
in
thy
anger
only
take
the
reproach
from
him
and
let
him
live
honourably
again
but
my
prayer
was
not
heard
since
then
god
has
forsaken
me
as
he
has
you
she
let
the
hands
which
had
been
raised
imploringly
to
the
crucifix
drop
in
her
lap
and
she
sank
back
exhausted
no
cynical
smile
stole
over
leo
face
now
his
powerful
neck
bent
as
if
he
willingly
offered
it
to
the
scourge
which
was
being
wielded
over
it
there
was
a
silence
then
he
said
in
a
low
tone
hannah
she
did
not
answer
hannah
he
said
again
with
a
look
in
his
straight
honest
eyes
that
seemed
secretly
to
beg
mercy
from
her
you
speak
to
me
as
if
i
were
a
felon
still
she
was
silent
hannah
he
urged
her
what
am
i
to
do
this
unhappy
thing
can
not
be
undone
there
was
a
light
in
her
eyes
you
are
sorry
then
for
what
has
happened
she
asked
raising
herself
erect
again
my
god
am
i
such
a
monster
he
replied
scarcely
audibly
that
i
should
take
a
special
pleasure
in
the
thought
that
i
have
slain
a
man
for
no
other
crime
than
defending
the
honour
of
his
name
then
you
are
ready
to
repent
she
asked
bending
towards
him
with
a
sort
of
impetuous
greed
a
shudder
ran
through
his
frame
repent
nothing
came
the
old
cry
within
him
now
that
he
knew
what
she
was
demanding
of
him
his
manliness
returned
what
do
you
call
repenting
he
asked
and
thrust
his
hand
in
his
pockets
shall
i
whimper
and
whine
and
tear
my
hair
shall
i
crawl
on
my
knees
like
a
scurvy
hound
no
dear
hannah
i
must
stick
to
my
defiance
to
my
merry
heart
and
thick
skin
if
i
am
to
set
things
right
and
now
out
with
it
what
have
i
got
exactly
to
repent
what
more
did
i
do
than
is
done
every
day
in
the
world
out
there
i
am
not
a
paragon
i
could
only
act
as
i
have
seen
others
act
then
from
the
point
of
view
of
comfort
your
outlook
on
life
leaves
nothing
to
wish
for
why
should
i
rush
headlong
into
discomfort
he
retorted
more
intrepid
than
he
really
felt
but
to
continue
you
know
my
cousinship
with
her
i
trust
that
you
will
not
fling
that
up
at
me
and
with
regard
to
rhaden
i
was
never
on
intimate
terms
with
him
i
knew
him
as
a
grumbling
fellow
nothing
more
so
there
can
be
no
question
of
a
breach
of
friendship
later
when
the
affair
got
wind
and
a
challenge
to
fight
was
given
me
in
the
garden
everything
was
done
correctly
he
it
was
who
desired
that
the
seconds
should
not
be
initiated
into
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
his
wife
reputation
must
be
saved
at
any
cost
i
simply
had
to
say
and
this
is
how
it
is
ulrich
rushed
into
matrimony
in
ignorance
of
what
had
really
happened
and
now
i
see
the
folly
of
it
and
that
is
the
mistake
i
so
bitterly
rue
well
to
proceed
the
quarrel
at
cards
had
to
be
arranged
as
a
blind
and
just
as
little
as
he
was
to
be
blamed
for
not
firing
in
the
air
can
i
be
blamed
for
shooting
him
down
for
you
see
i
was
obliged
to
defend
myself
i
will
admit
that
it
all
sounds
very
barbaric
in
black
and
white
but
it
is
not
my
vocation
to
revolutionise
morals
i
leave
that
to
the
social
democrats
i
accepted
my
sentence
and
punishment
and
with
my
period
of
exile
in
america
i
have
done
with
the
whole
thing
so
he
raised
his
fists
as
if
relieved
of
some
heavy
weight
with
this
drastic
explanation
he
hoped
to
break
once
for
all
the
chain
with
which
his
sister
had
tried
to
bring
his
will
into
subjection
to
her
own
but
he
could
not
evade
that
searching
hungry
glance
he
had
learned
to
fear
her
and
felt
that
she
meant
him
harm
if
you
will
deliberately
revel
in
evil
thus
she
said
i
must
give
you
up
as
lost
but
are
you
become
so
uncivilised
and
lawless
that
even
the
disgrace
which
your
friend
has
suffered
through
you
does
not
weigh
on
your
conscience
be
silent
he
shouted
jumping
up
you
do
wish
to
be
reproached
on
that
score
neither
will
i
be
reproached
the
misfortune
has
happened
any
step
that
i
might
take
now
would
only
increase
it
i
have
given
up
intercourse
with
him
do
you
think
that
was
easy
do
you
think
i
can
ever
be
quit
of
the
fear
of
what
may
befall
him
and
still
you
say
that
all
is
over
as
if
it
had
never
been
i
say
it
is
bound
to
be
so
yet
the
consequences
of
your
deed
cry
to
heaven
dear
leo
on
every
side
how
cry
to
heaven
if
you
do
know
it
i
must
tell
you
your
former
mistress
is
again
causing
scandals
without
end
your
friend
repute
is
in
bad
hands
who
knows
if
all
the
world
is
not
jeering
and
laughing
at
him
johanna
he
cried
with
a
feeling
as
if
his
heart
were
being
sundered
in
pieces
within
his
breast
johanna
you
lie
but
she
went
on
calm
and
hard
as
nails
god
knows
i
live
a
very
retired
life
but
the
gossip
has
even
penetrated
over
my
threshold
and
if
you
do
believe
me
you
have
only
to
make
a
few
inquiries
in
the
of
your
friends
and
acquaintances
there
likely
enough
stories
are
told
or
go
into
münsterberg
and
see
how
our
gilded
youths
exchange
glances
when
ulrich
drives
through
the
town
in
his
yellow
basket
carriage
that
is
a
signal
for
paying
calls
on
the
fair
felicitas
and
she
receives
them
all
go
to
the
and
count
the
number
of
her
male
correspondents
you
see
she
has
room
in
her
heart
for
so
many
stop
your
hate
verges
on
insanity
he
said
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
if
only
you
knew
how
far
above
hating
i
am
i
do
even
say
that
she
deceives
him
i
know
her
she
is
such
a
coward
such
a
coward
she
promise
every
one
what
he
wants
but
she
has
the
courage
to
keep
her
word
and
does
it
all
this
go
on
without
his
knowledge
he
stammered
forth
i
wish
that
it
did
she
responded
then
at
least
people
would
from
fear
of
his
horsewhip
have
more
caution
but
she
knows
too
well
that
she
can
trade
on
the
loftiness
of
his
nature
and
so
she
plays
her
game
quite
openly
under
his
very
eyes
with
bent
neck
and
his
breathing
thick
and
laboured
he
leant
against
the
wall
muttering
inarticulate
sounds
he
could
not
grasp
it
that
he
should
be
a
dupe
an
object
of
contempt
the
noblest
the
most
refined
of
men
it
was
more
than
his
thick
honest
head
could
take
in
then
fury
flamed
up
in
him
i
wish
i
had
her
here
between
my
fingers
he
bellowed
i
would
wring
her
neck
i
would
wring
her
neck
with
his
hands
grappling
the
air
his
nostrils
dilating
and
his
eyes
red
he
raged
about
the
room
it
was
well
for
pretty
felicitas
that
at
that
moment
she
was
safely
hidden
from
his
sight
johanna
watched
him
with
a
sour
smile
it
would
serve
her
right
said
she
but
what
can
you
do
you
are
powerless
before
her
i
what
do
you
take
me
for
am
i
a
cur
a
slave
of
women
her
charm
is
for
me
completely
broken
years
ago
i
should
confront
her
only
as
a
judge
again
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
this
time
compassionately
you
poor
boy
she
would
only
have
to
ask
has
made
me
what
i
am
and
your
occupation
of
the
would
come
to
an
end
he
sank
into
a
chair
the
tears
falling
fast
over
his
sunburnt
cheeks
in
which
excitement
had
dug
deep
furrows
he
sat
motionless
crushed
and
annihilated
she
drew
nearer
to
him
and
wiped
his
forehead
from
which
the
perspiration
poured
poor
poor
boy
she
said
and
then
close
to
his
ear
i
think
i
understand
what
can
be
done
a
long
silence
ensued
he
glowered
at
the
ground
the
corners
of
his
mouth
working
then
a
desperate
resolve
fought
its
way
slowly
upwards
within
him
at
last
he
murmured
i
see
nothing
for
it
but
to
open
his
eyes
good
heavens
she
cried
do
you
think
he
would
believe
you
he
would
say
that
she
had
already
told
him
herself
he
recalled
the
tone
of
gentle
consideration
in
which
his
friend
had
spoken
of
his
wife
bizarre
moods
it
would
not
be
very
difficult
for
a
pure
mind
like
ulrich
to
put
the
worst
in
a
harmless
light
and
besides
how
was
he
to
summon
up
the
courage
to
tell
his
friend
what
all
the
was
gossiping
about
he
who
himself
in
the
past
had
afforded
the
gravest
material
for
such
gossip
his
sister
taking
hold
of
his
hands
went
on
no
leo
that
wo
do
there
is
only
one
course
to
pursue
we
two
must
keep
watch
on
her
only
thus
can
we
you
as
well
as
i
make
amends
for
the
wrong
we
have
done
him
for
you
are
at
present
the
only
person
of
whom
she
is
afraid
the
only
one
who
has
any
power
over
her
and
you
must
use
this
power
to
bring
her
back
into
the
right
path
you
understand
what
i
mean
he
understood
only
too
well
what
she
demanded
was
the
total
destruction
of
all
his
vigorous
plans
there
was
no
doubt
that
if
he
became
reconciled
with
his
former
mistress
she
would
be
willing
to
receive
him
but
then
the
guilt
which
lay
buried
in
silence
must
be
dragged
again
into
the
light
of
day
if
he
crossed
his
friend
sacred
threshold
the
unholy
secret
must
bear
him
company
significant
glances
would
be
exchanged
at
the
table
and
guilty
whispers
echo
from
the
listening
walls
would
that
be
anything
more
or
less
than
reviving
the
sin
how
could
he
dare
meet
the
questioning
look
of
his
friend
if
at
the
same
time
the
eyes
of
the
rested
tenderly
upon
him
and
then
there
was
the
child
how
could
he
ever
bear
to
listen
again
to
that
innocent
prattle
how
could
he
endure
to
feel
the
pressure
of
the
delicate
little
body
as
he
came
to
be
swung
on
to
his
knee
the
sound
of
the
dear
childish
voice
as
it
called
him
by
pet
names
no
a
thousand
times
no
he
sprang
to
his
feet
she
threw
herself
in
his
way
you
wo
she
cried
in
an
agony
of
anxiety
but
he
seeing
further
conversation
was
useless
turned
to
go
and
she
apparently
beside
herself
with
mortification
at
the
collapse
through
his
reawakened
defiance
of
her
scheme
at
the
moment
when
its
success
had
seemed
assured
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
tried
to
hold
him
back
by
force
like
a
spirit
of
vengeance
she
clung
to
him
as
he
looked
down
on
her
he
recoiled
in
horror
from
the
mad
glitter
in
her
eye
oh
you
coward
you
dishonourable
coward
she
hissed
i
despise
you
how
i
despise
you
he
shook
her
off
and
walked
out
of
the
room
in
silence
not
the
same
man
as
he
came
in
of
that
he
was
fully
aware
for
he
had
barely
succeeded
in
holding
on
to
his
highest
resolution
out
of
the
wreck
of
his
character
as
behind
him
he
heard
his
sister
give
a
sharp
cry
as
she
fell
swooning
to
the
floor
but
he
did
not
turn
round
the
next
morning
his
mother
begged
of
him
the
services
of
half
a
dozen
workmen
to
move
johanna
goods
and
chattels
to
the
she
had
decided
not
to
stay
another
night
under
their
roof
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
now
he
need
not
meet
her
any
more
xii
his
cares
as
a
landlord
multiplied
it
was
true
there
was
a
prospect
of
the
harvest
being
carried
in
good
time
and
the
grain
which
could
be
quickest
turned
into
money
had
succeeded
splendidly
but
after
all
what
were
the
few
groschens
that
would
come
into
the
exchequer
by
this
means
the
work
of
undoing
root
and
branch
the
mischief
of
previous
mismanagement
needed
several
thousands
in
hand
leo
worked
with
all
his
might
from
the
first
sound
of
the
in
the
morning
to
the
extinguishing
of
the
last
stable
lantern
at
night
he
was
on
his
legs
and
when
all
the
windows
of
the
house
showed
a
dark
front
he
sat
bowed
over
the
old
where
he
calculated
and
reckoned
till
the
papers
became
dim
and
the
figures
swam
before
his
eyes
but
what
good
did
it
all
do
capital
was
lacking
and
capital
could
not
be
manufactured
to
begin
with
ulrich
gifts
of
love
must
be
yielded
as
mortgages
as
a
man
of
honour
he
owed
this
step
to
himself
and
his
friend
and
after
that
any
one
who
would
make
further
loans
would
deserve
to
be
incarcerated
in
an
asylum
so
for
weal
or
woe
things
must
jog
along
in
the
old
way
till
the
first
economies
allowed
of
starting
improvements
or
galvanizing
dead
investments
into
life
and
at
this
time
when
he
went
to
bed
and
closed
his
eyes
in
sleep
he
did
not
dream
as
once
he
was
wont
to
do
of
the
fine
figure
of
a
girl
a
thoroughbred
or
some
bold
escapade
instead
there
would
hover
before
his
eyes
as
the
goal
of
his
yearning
desires
a
massive
vaulted
roof
for
the
piggery
six
new
covered
carts
a
after
the
latest
zimmermann
pattern
and
an
unending
procession
of
similar
objects
which
stretched
their
distorted
shadows
over
the
borders
of
dreamland
the
pungent
humour
which
it
was
a
peculiarity
in
his
temperament
to
exercise
at
his
own
expense
never
deserted
him
and
made
it
easy
to
put
away
from
him
the
memory
of
even
recent
occurrences
of
an
unpleasant
description
where
should
i
be
now
without
work
he
said
thinking
of
the
interview
with
his
sister
ulrich
fate
loomed
largely
in
his
soul
and
he
could
not
silence
the
impulse
to
help
and
save
him
he
surprised
himself
sometimes
as
he
rode
over
the
fields
with
his
pipe
gone
out
in
his
mouth
and
his
hand
slackening
on
the
reins
deaf
and
blind
to
all
around
while
his
imagination
painted
the
hour
which
would
give
him
back
again
the
companion
of
his
youth
in
new
and
unalterably
happy
circumstances
oh
how
he
hated
the
woman
and
hated
himself
when
he
was
riding
thus
on
his
grey
mare
over
fields
of
yellow
stubble
in
the
blue
distance
the
shining
stream
which
in
a
few
minutes
might
be
crossed
but
which
nevertheless
lay
wider
than
the
ocean
between
him
and
his
friend
although
he
had
vowed
to
himself
that
a
future
meeting
was
not
to
be
thought
of
he
now
and
then
hit
on
a
pretext
for
ferrying
across
the
river
at
wengern
and
by
riding
up
the
to
münsterberg
clutched
at
the
mere
chance
of
it
twice
he
had
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
distance
on
horseback
in
his
meadows
he
still
rode
the
roan
which
leo
had
broken
in
for
him
six
years
ago
which
when
the
rider
on
its
back
swayed
to
one
side
stood
firm
as
a
rock
he
drew
up
under
one
of
the
trees
by
the
roadside
and
watched
him
as
he
ambled
away
in
the
direction
of
uhlenfelde
once
too
he
thought
he
had
seen
her
a
lightly
clad
figure
in
an
open
landau
had
driven
along
the
road
the
servants
wore
the
uhlenfelde
livery
who
else
could
it
be
but
she
this
time
he
did
not
draw
rein
he
dug
his
spurs
into
his
mare
and
galloped
off
at
headlong
speed
he
thought
with
a
shudder
of
the
moment
which
must
inevitably
come
when
they
could
not
avoid
meeting
should
he
greet
her
silently
or
would
he
pass
her
with
averted
eyes
he
did
not
know
that
they
would
one
day
come
face
to
face
was
certain
but
he
prayed
that
the
day
might
be
far
off
the
most
likely
place
to
meet
in
would
have
been
münsterberg
where
he
hardly
ever
went
he
avoided
the
town
because
he
had
made
no
formal
calls
on
the
neighbours
since
his
return
and
he
was
afraid
of
their
cold
looks
yet
it
was
imperative
that
with
the
harvest
progressing
the
right
opportunity
for
selling
should
not
be
missed
so
in
the
middle
of
august
he
paid
the
jew
a
visit
the
jew
as
the
landowners
called
him
for
short
was
an
influential
merchant
jacobi
by
name
who
was
the
medium
by
which
the
produce
of
the
estates
round
münsterberg
was
brought
into
the
markets
of
the
world
he
gave
and
lent
wherever
credit
was
possible
and
many
a
proud
knight
inheritance
belonged
by
rights
to
his
pocket
he
never
misused
his
power
and
a
single
case
in
which
he
had
played
the
shark
was
unknown
to
give
is
the
best
policy
he
used
to
say
and
acting
on
this
precept
he
enjoyed
unbounded
confidence
and
became
richer
year
by
year
he
was
sitting
at
the
oak
desk
in
his
in
the
same
corner
and
looking
the
same
with
his
grey
whiskers
and
glasses
on
the
flattened
tip
of
his
nose
as
he
had
done
five
years
ago
when
leo
had
said
to
him
ah
so
it
is
you
herr
baron
he
said
getting
up
and
he
took
off
his
he
addressed
all
nobly
born
landed
proprietors
with
whom
he
did
business
as
herr
baron
and
all
the
bourgeoise
as
herr
lieutenant
an
almost
paternal
smile
flitted
over
his
yellow
haggard
hebrew
countenance
as
he
looked
up
at
leo
with
his
eyes
which
had
a
clever
and
penetrating
twinkle
in
them
have
you
had
an
enjoyable
tour
herr
baron
he
continued
and
opened
the
little
door
in
the
partition
which
was
an
invitation
to
leo
to
enter
his
inner
sanctum
now
please
be
seated
herr
baron
i
was
half
afraid
that
the
herr
baron
was
never
to
sit
on
this
chair
again
but
the
crops
are
good
herr
baron
good
crops
and
one
could
see
certain
signs
of
smartening
up
which
told
of
the
herr
baron
being
at
home
once
more
not
sold
the
grain
yet
next
week
prices
will
rise
and
the
herr
baron
should
let
it
wait
till
prices
rise
for
this
year
i
will
make
nothing
out
of
the
herr
baron
you
are
a
good
fellow
jacobi
said
leo
shaking
the
old
jew
hand
he
was
conscious
that
here
was
a
person
that
knew
better
than
himself
how
things
stood
with
him
and
then
taking
heart
he
asked
what
do
you
think
jacobi
shall
i
be
able
to
hold
on
if
you
do
mind
my
saying
it
herr
baron
replied
the
old
man
when
a
man
is
what
the
herr
baron
is
such
a
question
is
ridiculous
a
man
like
the
herr
baron
has
only
to
say
do
this
or
that
and
he
can
compass
what
he
likes
and
in
addition
when
he
has
a
friend
like
the
herr
baron
of
uhlenfelde
who
is
the
wealthiest
man
in
the
district
well
then
he
can
hold
on
to
the
day
of
judgment
leo
felt
the
blood
mount
to
his
temples
it
was
taken
for
granted
then
by
those
who
knew
the
circumstances
that
he
had
been
living
on
his
friend
and
the
old
jew
went
on
only
five
minutes
ago
as
the
herr
baron
von
kletzingk
drove
by
i
said
to
myself
leo
started
up
and
asked
hastily
in
which
direction
he
had
driven
towards
the
station
was
the
answer
was
he
alone
the
old
man
tried
to
look
politely
blank
as
if
he
had
not
understood
the
real
drift
of
the
question
and
replied
that
so
far
as
he
could
see
the
herr
baron
had
been
alone
leo
seized
his
cap
promised
to
come
back
and
rushed
out
the
desire
to
overtake
ulrich
to
hold
his
hand
for
a
second
in
his
gained
such
sudden
ascendency
over
him
that
everything
else
receded
into
the
background
the
station
was
ten
minutes
walk
from
the
already
he
could
see
ulrich
yellow
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
stone
steps
he
could
not
evade
him
the
herr
baron
had
gone
to
the
he
was
informed
by
wilhelm
who
reigned
on
the
box
as
worthy
and
dignified
a
coachman
as
thirty
years
ago
he
found
the
empty
except
for
the
presence
of
a
boy
in
the
leo
scarcely
noticed
him
for
he
recognised
amongst
the
packages
thrown
on
the
table
ulrich
old
travelling
gear
his
plaid
rug
tan
and
beside
them
were
articles
strange
to
him
so
he
was
going
away
for
a
long
time
perhaps
he
was
all
the
more
glad
to
think
that
he
had
caught
him
should
he
go
out
and
find
him
no
it
would
be
better
to
await
him
here
where
there
was
no
one
to
look
on
curiously
at
their
meeting
no
one
but
that
small
boy
who
gazed
up
at
him
with
the
great
brown
eyes
set
in
a
pale
delicate
little
face
the
eyes
struck
him
as
familiar
and
the
gaunt
thin
cheeks
too
seemed
to
remind
him
of
a
face
belonging
to
his
past
there
was
some
unpleasant
memory
associated
with
it
but
what
it
was
he
was
unable
to
guess
for
the
moment
he
would
have
liked
to
ask
the
little
fellow
his
name
then
he
recollected
what
had
brought
him
there
and
how
little
the
outer
world
concerned
him
he
flung
himself
in
a
and
meditated
his
eye
fixed
absently
on
the
yellow
bag
which
bore
ulrich
initials
then
he
heard
a
voice
a
low
hesitating
childish
voice
say
uncle
leo
he
started
the
voice
sounded
like
one
he
knew
but
already
it
had
all
dawned
on
him
a
stream
of
ice
seemed
to
flow
from
his
heart
and
paralyse
his
limbs
he
could
not
move
and
again
he
heard
uncle
leo
there
lay
in
the
timid
trembling
tone
a
gentle
questioning
reproach
which
children
only
use
to
their
particular
friends
when
they
consider
themselves
neglected
by
them
now
worse
luck
he
was
bound
to
look
up
the
boy
had
come
out
of
his
corner
with
his
right
arm
round
the
plaid
rug
he
stood
by
the
table
glancing
up
shyly
at
leo
with
a
smile
who
are
you
my
little
man
he
stammered
he
felt
as
if
he
had
seen
a
ghost
here
were
eyes
in
rhaden
peaky
face
why
i
am
paul
of
course
said
the
boy
do
you
really
know
me
any
more
uncle
leo
he
forced
himself
into
a
joyous
exclamation
of
surprise
there
had
always
been
a
tie
of
affection
between
him
and
the
poor
little
fellow
he
could
not
hurt
his
feelings
now
without
cause
his
hands
clasped
together
convulsively
warn
him
not
to
touch
them
something
cried
aloud
within
him
but
the
boy
had
caught
hold
of
them
already
and
leaning
against
him
he
began
to
chatter
freely
i
knew
you
at
once
uncle
leo
directly
you
came
in
but
what
a
long
beard
you
got
now
you
had
a
beard
before
but
it
was
much
shorter
oh
it
is
such
a
dreadful
long
time
since
you
went
away
and
i
thought
when
you
came
back
you
would
sure
to
bring
me
something
because
you
always
used
to
bring
me
presents
the
you
gave
me
once
i
have
got
still
but
it
is
too
little
for
me
now
and
i
have
got
a
bigger
one
yours
is
the
foal
you
should
just
see
how
pretty
they
look
together
leo
bit
his
lips
and
nodded
smiling
how
long
have
you
been
home
uncle
leo
the
boy
asked
about
a
month
paulchen
he
answered
and
why
have
you
been
to
see
us
he
asked
again
when
my
other
papa
was
alive
you
used
to
come
every
day
i
have
had
no
time
paulchen
but
you
will
come
soon
when
i
can
of
course
paulchen
a
proud
smile
now
beamed
on
the
boy
thin
face
the
short
crooked
brows
of
which
had
been
working
nervously
up
and
down
but
i
sha
be
at
home
when
you
come
he
said
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
i
am
going
to
school
leo
gasped
to
school
where
ever
so
far
away
answered
the
little
fellow
wiesbaden
is
the
name
of
the
town
it
is
a
very
beautiful
town
mamma
says
and
mamma
has
given
me
a
lot
of
lovely
new
toys
and
i
am
taking
them
all
with
me
and
do
you
feel
frightened
asked
leo
mamma
says
schoolboys

never
frightened
answered
paul
boys
must
be
brave
but
poor
mamma
is
dreadfully
frightened
herself
she
cries
and
cries
look
here
wo
you
go
to
mamma
and
tell
her
there
is
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
i
suppose
you
will
be
going
at
michaelmas
asked
leo
flabbergasted
paulchen
laughed
contemptuously
no
indeed
he
said
we
are
starting
now
papa
and
i
by
this
very
train
papa
is
gone
to
look
after
the
big
luggage
and
i
am
waiting
here
for
him
leo
sprang
up
then
she
must
be
at
the
station
too
any
minute
she
might
come
in
at
that
door
the
hideousness
of
the
situation
which
in
listening
to
the
boy
pretty
talk
he
had
almost
forgotten
broke
on
him
afresh
he
clutched
at
his
cap
like
a
thief
he
must
slink
away
by
the
side
door
are
you
going
so
soon
uncle
leo
the
child
asked
anxiously
i
must
paulchen
and
are
you
going
to
say
to
me
an
irresistible
impulse
seized
him
he
caught
up
the
boy
in
his
arms
with
warmth
murmuring
inarticulate
words
over
him
he
felt
the
childish
lips
pressing
against
his
cheeks
caressingly
he
trembled
and
then
the
door
opened
and
not
she
whom
he
expected
but
ulrich
came
in
he
let
go
of
the
boy
and
seemed
to
himself
as
if
he
were
a
criminal
discovered
in
an
act
of
desecration
yet
when
he
saw
ulrich
look
of
dismay
and
reproach
he
went
to
him
quickly
and
taking
his
hand
said
in
a
low
voice
do
be
angry
and
do
reproach
me
it
was
pure
chance
i
did
not
even
recognise
him
when
i
first
came
in
and
found
him
sitting
here
i
could
not
run
away
when
he
came
and
spoke
to
me
i
have
bid
him
and
in
secret
asked
him
to
forgive
me
there
is
nothing
wrong
in
that
no
nothing
wrong
agreed
ulrich
that
is
true
leo
now
noticed
that
he
looked
even
a
shade
more
wretched
and
worn
than
on
that
evening
when
he
had
paid
him
his
farewell
visit
his
breath
was
short
his
eyes
burned
in
their
blue
hollows
you
are
not
well
my
dear
old
fellow
leo
inquired
had
he
not
known
by
experience
the
tenacity
of
ulrich
constitution
he
would
have
had
the
gravest
fears
i
have
been
much
worried
then
looking
at
his
he
added
questioningly
you
know
leo
nodded
ulrich
stroked
the
small
smooth
head
of
the
boy
whose
closely
cropped
brown
hair
grew
in
two
low
on
his
thoughtful
forehead
have
you
said
to
wilhelm
he
asked
no
he
had
forgotten
to
do
that
ulrich
looked
at
the
clock
there
were
still
ten
minutes
before
the
train
was
due
run
along
then
he
said
and
when
it
time
i
will
fetch
you
the
boy
ran
out
slightly
dragging
one
leg
a
habit
of
delicate
children
ulrich
looked
after
him
with
a
smile
full
of
sad
anxious
tenderness
it
will
be
hard
for
me
to
part
with
him
he
said
he
was
about
all
i
had
must
it
be
asked
leo
to
whom
the
suddenly
made
plan
of
which
there
had
been
no
hint
a
month
ago
seemed
not
a
little
extraordinary
ulrich
nodded
wrinkling
his
forehead
yes
it
must
he
said
i
should
never
have
consented
to
it
of
course
perhaps
simply
from
selfish
reasons
if
i
had
had
the
right
to
decide
over
the
future
but
he
is
and
she
wishes
it
she
is
not
here
asked
leo
again
betraying
uneasiness
no
ulrich
answered
with
great
difficulty
i
persuaded
her
to
stay
at
home
just
before
we
started
she
had
an
hysterical
fit
and
if
she
had
had
another
on
the
platform
it
would
have
made
a
scene
but
if
she
feels
it
so
much
why
does
she
send
him
away
a
shadow
of
pained
which
leo
knew
from
childhood
passed
over
ulrich
face
i
believe
it
is
my
fault
said
he
of
course
everything
is
your
fault
replied
leo
if
a
stone
falls
on
some
one
head
in
borneo
it
is
your
fault
ulrich
smiled
look
at
the
boy
he
said
and
then
at
me
and
you
must
see
that
if
he
were
my
own
flesh
and
blood
he
could
not
be
more
like
me
sickly
he
has
been
from
birth
sensitive
anæmic
just
as
i
have
been
and
since
he
has
become
attached
to
me
he
moulds
himself
more
and
more
after
my
pattern
and
nothing
could
be
worse
for
him
who
knows
what
i
should
have
grown
to
be
without
your
pluck
and
muscularity
to
rely
upon
he
has
had
no
such
comrade
as
i
had
in
you
instead
he
has
only
had
me
to
pamper
and
pet
him
under
my
guidance
he
must
grow
up
a
weakling
and
a
milksop
and
no
man
in
order
that
he
should
have
a
stronger
hand
over
him
i
advised
felicitas
to
engage
your
pastor
son
as
his
tutor
and
when
that
young
gentleman
began
to
demoralise
my
household
i
winked
at
it
for
the
boy
sake
finally
felicitas
herself
got
sick
of
him
and
sent
him
packing
for
two
or
three
weeks
after
that
she
taught
the
little
chap
herself
but
felicitas
is
not
the
person
to
stick
long
to
that
sort
of
thing
and
she
was
certainly
right
when
she
decided
on
a
new
move
i
dare
not
take
on
my
shoulders
the
responsibility
of
being
the
ruin
of
her
son
it
all
sounded
rational
enough
yet
in
spite
of
that
it
was
monstrous
but
if
you
must
sacrifice
him
exclaimed
leo
why
send
him
to
the
other
end
of
the
country
he
might
be
ill
and
die
before
you
got
to
him
hold
me
answerable
for
as
much
as
you
like
answered
ulrich
and
his
eyes
glistened
with
anxiety
but
just
in
this
matter
you
must
leave
me
out
the
child
is
not
my
child
and
i
am
bound
to
acquiesce
all
i
can
do
is
to
see
that
the
thing
is
properly
done
felicitas
chose
the
school
the
energy
with
which
she
set
about
it
astonished
me
she
declares
that
such
a
thorough
change
of
air
may
prove
most
blessedly
beneficial
to
the
boy
both
mentally
and
physically
provided
that
the
influence
of
his
earlier
surroundings
are
entirely
eradicated
i
should
be
quite
ready
to
agree
with
her
in
theory
if
the
application
of
that
theory
did
not
tear
my
heartstrings
but
why
do
i
talk
of
myself
she
is
the
mother
by
blood
of
the
child
she
must
suffer
more
than
ah
and
what
will
she
not
yet
have
to
suffer
leo
was
silent
suspicion
dim
at
first
that
his
coming
home
had
something
to
do
with
what
had
happened
grew
clearer
and
stronger
in
his
mind
was
it
fear
that
now
he
was
in
the
neighbourhood
some
rumour
of
the
horrible
deed
might
poison
the
heart
of
the
child
which
had
prompted
the
mother
to
send
him
away
the
poor
little
peace
of
mind
and
innocence
might
be
blasted
for
ever
by
the
tactless
gossip
of
a
servant
or
an
overheard
tag
of
conversation
for
this
she
was
parting
with
him
sending
him
into
banishment
that
the
well
of
his
pure
childhood
days
should
remain
undefiled
he
had
never
suspected
her
of
such
powers
of
renunciation
it
seemed
almost
too
great
a
sacrifice
to
be
wrung
from
a
mother
heart
however
frivolous
she
might
be
this
atoned
for
much
the
wonder
was
that
ulrich
saw
or
suspected
nothing
of
all
this
despite
his
being
the
practical
philosopher
be
always
seemed
to
be
more
and
more
hopelessly
out
of
touch
with
the
practical
side
of
life
but
to
open
his
eyes
would
have
been
cruel
cruel
to
himself
more
than
to
any
one
else
why
impose
a
fresh
burden
on
their
friendship
already
bowed
to
the
earth
the
bell
announcing
the
incoming
train
sounded
outside
ulrich
sprang
up
go
out
that
way
he
said
pointing
to
the
door
that
led
into
the
so
that
you
do
see
him
again
yes
you
are
right
i
promise
that
it
shall
be
the
last
time
replied
leo
he
squeezed
his
friend
hand
and
went
and
behind
him
he
heard
a
voice
calling
uncle
leo
xiii
hertha
was
not
feeling
happy
she
had
built
such
high
hopes
on
return
that
it
was
only
natural
that
she
should
be
disappointed
how
she
had
thought
about
him
prayed
and
worked
for
him
and
now
she
had
to
retire
into
the
background
his
teasing
wounded
her
his
demand
that
she
should
obey
him
seemed
almost
an
insult
and
since
her
stepmother
had
migrated
to
the
hertha
thought
seriously
of
leaving
halewitz
altogether
she
had
written
three
letters
already
to
her
guardian
asking
to
be
taken
away
but
had
torn
them
up
then
it
would
not
be
easy
to
separate
herself
from
this
spot
of
green
earth
where
the
sun
seemed
to
shine
brighter
and
hearts
to
be
kindlier
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
nobody
not
even
grandmamma
suspected
anything
of
these
struggles
going
on
in
her
heart
they
came
and
then
were
over
as
if
they
had
never
been
they
were
a
luxury
reserved
for
lonely
musing
hours
at
rosy
sunset
or
by
pale
moonlight
in
the
glorious
drowsy
solitude
of
the
forest
and
on
meadow
paths
they
began
of
themselves
but
ceased
at
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
she
derived
from
them
a
painful
joy
a
defiance
that
longed
to
be
conquered
and
cling
to
some
one
a
thirst
for
battle
which
she
only
wished
to
end
in
a
slowly
bleeding
prostrate
martyrdom
the
reaction
was
a
wild
whirl
through
house
and
courtyard
as
before
she
would
romp
and
skip
about
to
her
heart
content
fraternizing
with
all
the
live
stock
and
as
she
no
longer
might
superintend
the
milking
she
slept
from
pique
till
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
elly
trotted
obediently
in
her
wake
as
she
had
always
done
only
sometimes
when
her
friend
pranks
were
a
little
too
much
for
her
did
she
strike
and
go
to
grandmamma
with
complaints
for
which
hertha
gave
her
a
scolding
and
she
became
her
abject
slave
once
more
for
the
rest
grandmamma
took
care
that
the
trees
did
not
grow
into
the
sky
now
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
in
the
gardening
or
the
housekeeping
line
there
was
time
for
reading
french
in
the
morning
doing
and
practising
pieces
on
the
piano
after
that
was
over
one
was
free
to
go
for
walks
to
bathe
or
to
loaf
as
much
as
one
pleased
it
was
a
sultry
steamy
evening
at
the
beginning
of
september
the
river
lay
softly
gleaming
like
a
mirror
of
molten
silver
clouds
rose
on
the
horizon
which
now
and
then
opened
with
a
faint
flash
unanswered
by
any
echo
of
thunder
on
the
wooded
rising
ground
above
the
river
the
glossy
fat
red
pony
half
harnessed
to
his
small
was
standing
flapping
with
tail
and
mane
at
the
midges
which
seemed
more
impertinent
in
their
onslaughts
than
usual
occasionally
he
sent
forth
a
pathetic
neigh
in
the
direction
of
the
bank
where
the
white
awning
of
a
glimmered
above
the
woolly
heads
of
the
bulrushes
from
inside
came
those
shrieks
half
frightened
half
joyous
in
which
young
indulge
when
disporting
themselves
in
the
water
it
was
some
time
before
the
door
opened
and
hertha
appeared
still
steaming
from
the
damp
warm
air
within
she
jumped
on
to
the
that
oscillated
violently
while
elly
always
rather
pale
but
still
whiter
after
bathing
poked
her
delicate
little
nose
out
guardedly
waiting
till
hertha
should
have
left
the
dangerous
plank
not
till
then
did
she
become
fully
visible
near
the
a
light
danced
on
the
dark
water
it
could
not
have
been
used
for
a
long
time
and
had
been
left
neglected
to
its
own
devices
the
seats
were
missing
the
rudder
had
been
torn
out
and
at
the
bottom
between
its
thin
ribs
a
muddy
whirlpool
gurgled
up
at
its
every
motion
what
a
pity
the
nice
boat
should
not
be
used
said
hertha
and
sprang
into
it
the
dirty
water
spurted
up
and
sprinkled
her
face
but
she
did
not
mind
that
laughing
she
tucked
her
skirts
up
above
her
knees
her
shoes
and
stockings
were
still
in
her
hand
and
her
legs
firm
round
and
softly
moulded
like
pilasters
of
parian
marble
stood
out
from
the
black
background
then
she
squatted
on
the
steerer
seat
the
only
one
there
was
put
her
footgear
in
safety
and
seemed
as
if
she
were
quite
prepared
to
stay
there
elly
looked
alarmed
oh
dear
i
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
cried
tripping
about
on
the
steps
of
the
do
come
back
and
be
good
the
exhortation
be
good
she
had
retained
from
her
childhood
hertha
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
head
and
stared
into
the
distance
dumbly
weaving
fancies
out
into
the
current
circling
with
the
eddies
swept
ever
onwards
away
to
the
wide
ocean
into
the
blue
immensity
that
was
what
she
longed
for
at
this
moment
then
drawing
herself
erect
she
asked
i
say
how
does
the
boat
come
here
leo
used
to
keep
it
years
ago
lying
on
the
sandbank
so
that
he
could
get
over
by
it
quickly
to
uhlenfelde
and
the
isle
of
friendship
elly
informed
her
the
isle
of
friendship
a
double
romance
cast
its
halo
about
the
little
island
with
its
bushes
and
coronet
of
alders
and
birches
above
which
like
the
curly
head
of
some
drowned
giant
reared
itself
from
the
water
and
looked
fiercely
across
to
the
other
side
a
tiny
morsel
of
white
masonry
gleamed
through
the
sombre
density
of
the
foliage
that
must
be
the
temple
of
which
the
with
superstitious
awe
whispered
mysterious
legends
into
each
other
ears
in
ancient
times
the
island
had
been
the
scene
of
heathen
sacrifices
it
was
said
that
the
terrible
stone
was
still
to
be
seen
from
which
the
druid
priest
had
spurted
the
blood
of
the
slain
victim
towards
heaven
and
when
on
dark
nights
you
passed
the
island
you
saw
even
now
figures
swathed
in
long
white
robes
crouching
in
the
branches
of
the
alders
in
more
modern
times
the
two
friends
had
invoked
the
old
spirit
and
brought
it
back
to
life
and
people
related
besides
that
on
either
side
of
the
mossy
sacrificial
stone
they
had
each
opened
a
vein
of
the
other
and
drank
the
warm
blood
that
they
had
composed
hymns
to
the
white
statue
and
burnt
incense
before
it
so
that
red
fire
was
seen
rising
nightly
into
the
sky
hertha
had
heard
all
this
from
elly
lips
at
school
and
it
had
fired
her
imagination
the
romances
of
her
the
heroes
of
which
had
long
ago
been
cast
away
as
rubbish
with
her
old
exercise
and
composition
books
lived
again
a
decade
later
in
her
soul
glowing
and
glorious
with
mystery
before
she
knew
halewitz
at
all
she
had
pined
to
see
the
isle
of
friendship
and
as
thanks
to
grandmamma
anxious
vigilance
she
had
not
been
allowed
to
set
foot
on
it
yet
the
very
thought
of
it
possessed
a
magic
which
filled
her
with
the
same
sweet
thrills
which
had
been
her
delight
in
twilight
hours
at
school
she
got
up
and
stretched
out
her
arms
longingly
if
only
she
might
get
across
at
that
instant
her
eye
caught
sight
of
an
oar
lying
horizontally
along
the
edge
of
the
boat
and
wedged
into
it
but
the
twin
oar
was
missing
an
audacious
plan
began
to
take
shape
in
her
mind
she
remembered
to
have
seen
an
old
key
hanging
up
inside
the
which
apparently
belonged
to
the
boat
she
would
make
elly
fetch
it
elly
was
horrified
what
you
going
to
do
hertha
banged
with
her
fist
on
the
side
of
the
boat
when
she
commanded
she
expected
blind
obedience
a
few
seconds
later
the
little
implement
covered
with
rust
was
thrown
into
her
lap
a
sudden
furious
ardour
came
over
her
with
the
unfastened
lock
still
in
her
hand
she
tore
the
oar
out
of
its
old
and
dug
it
with
all
her
strength
deep
in
the
morass
from
which
glittering
bubbles
came
gurgling
to
the
surface
poor
elly
lamentations
died
away
unheeded
the
boat
began
slowly
to
break
through
the
reeds
and
sedges
and
to
drift
up
the
stream
hertha
calculated
that
if
she
kept
to
the
calm
shallows
near
the
bank
and
worked
her
way
up
to
a
point
where
she
would
have
left
the
island
a
hundred
paces
behind
her
she
might
hope
by
skilful
steering
and
even
with
only
one
oar
to
master
the
current
and
reach
her
goal
by
a
circuitous
route
when
she
saw
that
she
was
really
making
progress
she
uttered
a
cry
of
triumph
and
worked
on
with
yet
hotter
zeal
meanwhile
elly
like
a
motherless
chicken
ran
wildly
up
and
down
amongst
the
reeds
and
rushes
on
the
bank
getting
her
shoes
stuck
in
the
slime
and
falling
over
she
wrung
her
hands
and
implored
hertha
to
come
back
but
for
answer
was
laughed
to
scorn
but
hertha
nemesis
soon
overtook
her
the
boat
that
unintentionally
she
had
launched
into
a
whirling
began
to
turn
round
of
itself
for
a
few
moments
it
stayed
motionless
as
if
not
sure
what
to
do
next
then
began
to
glide
at
first
slowly
and
afterwards
more
and
more
rapidly
towards
the
valley
it
passed
the
and
the
island
and
descended
gaily
in
elly
saw
how
hertha
lost
her
grasp
of
the
oar
and
threw
it
away
how
she
spread
out
her
arms
and
called
out
some
words
quite
unintelligible
so
that
she
did
not
know
whether
they
meant
triumph
or
despair
she
went
back
to
her
cart
sat
down
on
the
grass
beside
the
pony
to
await
coming
events
and
wept
thus
it
happened
that
when
supper
was
ready
at
halewitz
neither
of
the
girls
put
in
an
appearance
leo
tried
to
laugh
away
his
uneasiness
but
at
once
ordered
the
mare
to
be
resaddled
which
stood
sweating
in
the
stable
put
a
flask
of
brandy
in
his
pocket
whistled
for
his
namesake
and
started
off
two
minutes
later
over
the
dewy
meadows
to
the
river
the
thunderstorm
which
had
been
threatening
all
day
had
dispersed
a
crescent
moon
shone
serenely
in
the
blue
and
gold
expanse
of
cloud
he
could
not
deny
that
he
was
anxious
about
the
girls
two
such
giddy
young
creatures
it
was
true
might
certainly
lose
themselves
without
being
in
any
particular
danger
but
hertha
had
the
devil
in
her
and
her
escapades
were
generally
serious
the
dog
who
had
bounded
on
before
him
discovered
the
pony
cart
with
a
howl
of
joy
he
was
about
to
give
a
sigh
of
relief
when
he
saw
elly
was
crouching
on
the
ground
alone
bathed
in
tears
the
reins
slid
from
his
hand
and
the
mare
and
everything
else
seemed
to
spin
round
where
is
hertha
he
burst
forth
his
sister
with
a
sob
pointed
to
the
stream
he
saw
nothing
but
green
and
yellow
sparks
dancing
before
his
eyes
drowned
he
asked
hoarsely
she
shook
her
head
but
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
get
a
clear
account
of
what
had
happened
why
did
you
not
instantly
make
for
home
and
fetch
help
he
demanded
his
hand
tightening
on
the
bridle
you
really
must
shout
at
me
like
that
i
am
so
awfully
afraid
of
you
was
her
plaintive
reply
accompanied
by
one
of
her
practised
glances
from
eyes
which
would
have
melted
a
heart
of
stone
he
laughed
half
annoyed
half
mollified
and
gave
her
orders
to
drive
home
at
express
speed
and
tell
the
bailiff
to
send
a
conveyance
with
servants
and
lanterns
immediately
to
newferry
the
nearest
village
of
a
mile
away
in
the
valley
she
climbed
obediently
into
the
cart
and
he
lashed
his
horse
and
tore
over
stubble
marsh
and
sedge
into
the
dusk
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
stream
which
glowing
and
vapouring
as
if
covered
with
burning
petrol
ran
beside
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
every
sandbank
and
every
drifting
plank
stood
out
black
and
sharply
defined
from
the
fiery
gold
channel
beneath
yet
night
was
drawing
on
apace
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
even
it
would
be
impossible
to
discern
the
little
craft
driven
on
noiselessly
through
the
shadows
and
from
the
side
of
the
a
quarter
of
the
stream
breadth
was
hidden
from
view
already
he
drew
up
and
called
her
name
through
the
silence
there
was
no
answer
except
the
barking
of
his
hound
who
had
taken
advantage
of
the
pause
to
go
off
on
a
hunt
for
birds
nests
and
nocturnal
vermin
sneaking
amongst
the
wheat
and
stubble
he
rested
in
his
stirrups
and
surveyed
the
landscape
from
this
point
the
river
could
be
seen
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
but
there
was
not
a
sign
of
a
boat
upon
it
for
during
the
summer
droughts
shipping
was
at
a
standstill
and
what
lighter
craft
might
be
about
sought
a
haven
at
nightfall
in
the
little
of
the
inns
where
the
shrubs
and
woodwork
protected
them
from
the
current
he
rode
on
the
surface
of
the
water
became
darker
and
darker
and
his
uneasiness
increased
if
she
spent
the
night
on
the
stream
sitting
in
the
little
boat
with
water
she
would
probably
catch
her
death
the
bank
which
so
far
had
sloped
down
to
the
reeds
in
slight
declivities
became
lower
here
a
dyke
made
by
human
hands
replaced
the
natural
one
of
boscage
now
the
prospect
was
more
open
but
this
availed
nothing
for
the
face
of
the
stream
had
become
a
monotonous
dark
blue
the
moon
had
sunk
and
only
the
reflection
of
a
star
here
and
there
trembled
softly
gleaming
on
the
waters
once
more
his
call
rang
out
into
the
distance
croaking
frogs
held
their
tongues
and
that
was
the
only
result
here
the
outlying
houses
of
newferry
showed
in
black
outline
near
the
dyke
two
or
three
mongrels
rushed
out
of
the
yards
and
set
up
a
furious
yapping
which
leo
the
hound
received
in
lofty
silence
till
they
growing
more
impertinent
ventured
to
touch
him
then
he
seized
them
one
after
the
other
by
the
back
and
administered
a
sound
shaking
there
was
a
faint
whine
and
all
was
still
again
in
the
houses
every
one
seemed
to
have
gone
to
bed
the
inn
itself
lay
dark
and
deserted
nowhere
did
a
boat
cast
its
shadow
on
the
bank
nevertheless
he
stopped
and
called
her
name
across
to
the
house
he
listened
awhile
but
no
sound
came
except
the
renewed
barking
of
the
dogs
there
would
be
time
enough
on
his
way
back
to
wake
the
people
of
the
inn
if
he
had
not
found
her
before
that
he
resumed
his
gallop
over
the
loamy
ground
of
the
dyke
the
black
line
of
which
uncoiled
itself
like
a
serpent
before
him
and
was
lost
in
the
bluish
haze
he
passed
more
villages
two
three
altogether
and
met
with
the
same
luck
everywhere
a
cloud
of
steam
rose
from
his
horse
haunches
its
head
was
sticky
from
sweat
and
great
flecks
of
foam
flew
about
from
its
snorting
nostrils
the
dog
breath
came
in
short
panting
gasps
as
if
he
too
apparently
had
begun
to
come
to
the
end
of
his
powers
leo
calculated
that
he
had
ridden
about
two
miles
along
the
bank
of
the
river
further
than
this
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
have
reached
in
the
last
four
hours
somewhere
then
within
this
compass
she
must
yet
be
afloat
if
she
was
not
making
her
way
home
to
halewitz
he
sent
the
dog
into
the
reeds
and
began
to
ride
back
at
a
walking
pace
the
night
slowly
spread
its
white
damp
veil
over
the
landscape
the
crickets
chirruped
and
now
and
then
there
was
a
swish
in
the
water
as
a
shot
out
from
the
shore
into
the
surface
by
the
time
he
had
reached
newferry
again
he
had
given
up
the
search
and
resolved
to
raise
the
alarm
among
the
inhabitants
the
conveyance
from
halewitz
had
not
arrived
for
the
inn
still
lay
in
darkness
and
silence
he
got
off
his
horse
tied
the
bridle
to
the
sunk
fence
over
which
sunflowers
poked
their
round
faces
like
women
giving
a
sleepy
and
sulky
greeting
he
stretched
his
limbs
with
a
groan
for
they
had
become
damp
and
stiff
from
riding
through
the
mist
he
regarded
the
excitement
of
the
last
few
hours
almost
in
the
light
of
a
blessing
for
it
had
taken
his
mind
off
the
one
eternal
thought
that
had
tormented
it
for
weeks
now
of
a
sudden
it
came
back
and
then
was
gone
again
like
an
arrow
whizzing
past
the
ear
as
a
reminder
from
a
hidden
enemy
when
once
i
have
found
her
he
thought
i
do
mind
what
i
go
through
into
the
bargain
he
would
never
have
thought
it
possible
that
the
strange
young
creature
whose
stony
defiance
and
noisy
boisterous
tricks
had
alternately
annoyed
and
amused
him
could
have
become
so
dear
to
his
heart
he
walked
with
stiff
legs
in
high
along
the
dark
wooden
palings
to
the
front
door
on
the
stone
threshold
of
which
the
dog
stretched
on
all
fours
was
howling
and
scratching
as
if
he
wanted
to
bore
his
way
inside
like
a
mole
the
low
door
yielded
to
a
push
he
stumbled
down
into
a
dark
vestibule
but
through
the
door
beyond
a
fire
flickered
brightly
on
the
open
hearth
and
lifting
his
eyes
he
beheld
the
lost
girl
standing
before
him
illuminated
by
the
flames
she
wore
a
short
red
gathered
peasant
skirt
from
beneath
which
her
naked
feet
shone
forth
she
held
a
coarse
woollen
crossover
with
her
thin
brown
arms
tightly
round
her
bosom
the
short
sleeves
of
a
rough
yellowish
linen
chemise
of
the
kind
that
peasants
spin
themselves
showed
under
it
she
stared
aghast
at
the
intruder
her
face
deadly
pale
the
dog
sprang
up
on
her
with
a
yelp
of
pleasure
but
she
did
not
touch
him
my
dear
dear
child
cried
leo
stretching
his
hands
out
to
her
in
unfeigned
gladness
i
have
found
you
thank
god
found
you
the
blood
came
rushing
back
into
her
cheeks
and
she
cast
down
her
eyes
but
made
no
sign
of
taking
the
hands
held
out
to
her
then
she
said
in
a
low
voice
without
lifting
her
eyes
from
the
floor
will
you
be
so
kind
uncle
leo
as
to
tell
the
dog
to
be
quiet
the
woman
here
is
ill
and
her
husband
is
gone
to
münsterberg
for
the
doctor
a
motion
of
his
foot
sent
the
dog
into
a
corner
but
how
about
you
my
child
he
exclaimed
you
do
speak
of
yourself
she
had
been
quite
prepared
for
a
scolding
and
was
not
sure
in
what
tone
she
should
answer
this
overwhelming
friendliness
a
wavering
smile
alike
defiant
and
pained
played
about
the
corners
of
her
mouth
well
you
see
what
i
am
doing
she
said
evading
his
glance
i
am
here
brewing
elder
tea
for
the
sick
woman
a
kettle
stood
on
the
tripod
near
her
on
the
hearth
licked
by
the
ruddy
flames
and
what
have
you
got
on
he
asked
she
stepped
quickly
out
of
the
circuit
of
light
cast
by
the
fire
and
drew
the
shawl
with
her
left
hand
closer
round
her
throat
i
had
to
put
on
just
what
i
could
find
she
stammered
so
please
do
look
at
me
there
hung
drying
above
the
fire
on
a
clothes
line
a
wet
skirt
which
still
steamed
and
near
it
a
draggled
rag
which
was
the
light
cotton
blouse
she
had
been
wearing
that
day
you
were
upset
he
exclaimed
hardly
able
to
master
his
horror
she
tried
to
shrug
her
shoulders
indifferently
but
looked
rather
piteous
as
she
did
so
upset
she
said
well
what
of
that
i
simply
swam
ashore
in
those
clothes
he
asked
what
woman
could
ever
swim
in
clothes
good
gracious
she
exclaimed
with
her
eyes
still
on
the
floor
why
not
the
things
i
could
do
without
i
left
in
the
boat
they
will
turn
up
somewhere
now
child
tell
me
all
about
it
he
urged
what
am
i
to
tell
you
she
replied
you
will
only
scold
me
and
her
lips
curled
saucily
i
promise
i
wo
he
assured
her
then
here
goes
she
said
and
fetched
a
deep
breath
as
if
to
gain
courage
for
the
task
when
i
found
all
at
once
that
i
had
got
into
the
current
and
saw
that
with
one
wretched
oar
i
could
get
out
again
i
thought
to
myself
will
be
done
at
any
rate
you
will
enjoy
the
beautiful
evening
till
some
one
comes
to
pick
you
up
but
no
one
came
but
i
did
mind
that
either
it
was
really
so
wonderful
to
see
reeds
and
banks
rushing
by
it
was
like
being
in
the
middle
of
fairyland
she
paused
and
looked
up
at
him
with
great
scared
eyes
as
if
she
suddenly
recollected
to
whom
she
was
speaking
then
she
devoted
herself
to
the
kettle
raised
the
lid
and
blew
the
flames
why
do
you
go
on
he
insisted
on
knowing
i
ca
she
said
softly
you
look
at
me
all
the
time
i
look
the
other
way
he
said
then
she
resigned
herself
to
fate
and
continued
after
it
had
lasted
half
an
hour
and
more
it
began
to
bore
me
i
had
no
place
to
rest
my
feet
on
for
the
water
splashed
about
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
when
the
houses
of
newferry
came
in
sight
i
thought
to
myself
now
my
troubles
will
end
and
i
called
out
and
yelled
at
the
top
of
my
voice
but
all
in
vain
the
hole
is
called
newferry
but
not
a
sign
of
a
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
well
then
i
simplified
matters
by
jumping
into
the
water
girlie
you
must
have
been
possessed
by
a
demon
he
cried
half
angry
half
laughing
so
the
people
thought
in
the
village
she
replied
because
when
i
bobbed
up
at
the
dyke
they
all
ran
away
from
me
it
was
a
good
thing
that
i
happened
to
know
the
people
at
the
inn
they
used
to
rent
our
that
is
to
say
at
halewitz
he
mentioned
the
name
that
occurred
to
him
yes
buttkus
that
was
it
and
then
she
told
him
of
the
miserable
plight
she
had
found
the
house
in
the
woman
lay
in
bed
delirious
from
fever
the
landlord
in
desperation
had
resorted
to
the
brandy
bottle
i
sent
the
fellow
off
on
the
spot
to
münsterberg
to
fetch
the
doctor
she
concluded
and
i
shall
stay
here
till
he
comes
back
whether
you
think
that
i
ought
or
not
and
she
gave
him
a
challenging
look
as
if
she
saw
herself
being
carried
out
of
the
place
by
force
but
he
at
once
soothed
her
nothing
was
farther
from
his
thoughts
than
to
disturb
her
in
her
noble
work
of
charity
one
question
you
must
answer
however
he
said
well
an
hour
ago
you
were
here
certainly
i
was
did
you
hear
your
name
being
called
she
seemed
embarrassed
reflected
a
little
and
then
said
in
a
decisive
tone
yes
and
why
did
you
answer
there
was
silence
she
took
the
kettle
off
the
tripod
and
poured
the
water
which
was
boiling
into
a
stewpan
from
which
rose
the
fragrant
scent
of
elder
flowers
you
allow
me
at
least
to
take
the
woman
her
tea
she
said
the
poor
thing
has
such
shivering
fits
and
without
waiting
for
his
response
she
went
out
at
the
door
holding
the
handle
of
the
hot
stewpan
deftly
between
two
fingers
leo
devoured
with
his
eyes
the
slender
virginal
figure
in
its
rough
costume
as
it
disappeared
into
the
darkness
he
seated
himself
on
an
oak
stump
which
chopped
up
was
used
for
firewood
and
let
his
fingers
idly
run
along
the
teeth
of
the
hatchet
turned
into
an
instrument
of
gold
by
the
flickering
firelight
the
bernard
looked
up
at
him
with
intelligent
eyes
like
a
fairy
tale
she
had
said
and
this
was
like
being
in
a
fairy
tale
too
the
walls
were
covered
with
rough
household
utensils
the
huge
open
was
all
encrusted
with
glittering
flakes
of
soot
that
struggled
upwards
in
fantastic
zigzag
shapes
and
when
loosened
from
the
velvet
cloud
of
smoke
rained
down
on
to
the
hearth
in
a
shower
of
metallic
scales
above
the
fire
of
crackling
logs
along
which
the
blue
flames
greedily
felt
their
way
before
plunging
into
their
heart
the
steaming
blouse
belonging
to
the
careless
child
wreathed
the
hearth
with
a
garland
the
quivering
reflection
of
the
flames
shot
up
brilliantly
and
filled
the
room
one
moment
the
next
they
sank
giving
place
to
dark
shadows
his
own
shadow
most
conspicuous
magnified
to
gigantic
proportions
on
the
wall
and
rising
to
the
ceiling
with
a
black
hatchet
grasped
in
his
hand
a
grim
sentinel
like
this
shadow
he
thought
holding
the
hatchet
and
waiting
a
chance
to
bring
it
down
was
that
old
sin
there
was
no
path
along
which
it
did
not
follow
him
where
he
was
it
was
too
in
this
hour
it
would
not
tolerate
for
a
moment
that
he
should
forget
it
he
looked
at
the
clock
ten
minutes
past
eleven
and
still
there
was
no
sound
of
the
carriage
coming
he
rose
and
went
out
on
tiptoe
up
to
the
dyke
to
look
round
as
he
came
to
where
his
mare
was
standing
he
saw
with
alarm
that
its
smoking
body
was
convulsed
with
cold
shivers
well
to
be
born
a
landed
proprietor
he
reflected
if
i
was
my
groom
this
negligence
would
cost
me
my
situation
and
bread
hurriedly
he
went
back
and
found
in
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
a
patchwork
square
such
as
the
poor
people
use
instead
of
carpet
in
this
he
wrapped
the
shaking
animal
after
he
had
dried
its
legs
and
flanks
with
a
towel
far
and
wide
darkness
and
silence
reigned
only
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
a
torchlight
came
and
went
and
reappeared
in
another
place
probably
nocturnal
were
abroad
the
mist
had
thickened
and
appeared
to
be
heavy
on
the
river
tags
detached
themselves
now
and
then
and
melted
in
the
starry
sky
or
hung
about
the
bushes
and
shrubs
whose
blurred
blackness
rose
out
of
a
milky
surface
he
heard
a
soft
trickling
sound
coming
from
the
trees
near
the
dew
was
falling
he
shivered
in
his
damp
clothes
god
be
praised
that
i
have
got
her
safe
he
thought
and
turned
back
to
the
house
as
he
stepped
softly
over
the
threshold
he
fancied
he
heard
hertha
speaking
his
name
he
stood
still
in
astonishment
leo
my
dear
dear
leo
he
had
never
heard
any
words
in
his
life
so
fervid
so
full
of
awed
and
hesitating
tenderness
but
the
problem
was
soon
solved
she
was
sitting
on
the
oak
stump
bending
down
caressing
the
dog
whose
head
rested
between
her
feet
which
were
now
shod
in
stockings
and
wooden
shoes
he
was
inwardly
vexed
and
laughed
but
she
when
she
heard
him
coming
sprang
up
with
a
cry
as
if
she
had
been
doing
something
very
wrong
i
was
so
big
a
blockhead
for
a
minute
he
confessed
laughing
as
to
think
that
was
meant
for
me
a
fresh
wave
of
colour
swept
her
cheeks
then
shrugging
her
shoulders
she
said
you
are
mistaken
yes
i
always
am
being
mistaken
he
answered
and
turning
to
the
dog
he
added
you
are
lucky
old
boy
your
master
is
treated
but
you
who
are
itself
get
caresses
and
endearments
uncle
leo
she
began
with
flashing
eyes
i
hope
that
you
will
be
chivalrous
enough
at
least
not
to
take
advantage
of
my
helpless
position
to
scoff
at
me
but
my
dear
child
he
said
soothingly
do
call
me
your
dear
child
i
am
not
your
dear
child
i
am
a
stranger
to
you
as
much
as
any
one
else
i
am
a
lonely
forsaken
girl
whom
you
found
receiving
hospitality
under
your
roof
you
let
her
stay
because
you
can
not
very
well
tell
her
to
go
but
simply
because
i
am
still
your
guest
i
beg
that
you
will
not
speak
to
me
now
but
go
away
leave
me
to
my
fate
i
dare
say
that
i
can
find
my
way
home
though
after
that
i
am
not
quite
certain
what
i
shall
do
she
stood
leaning
against
the
inglenook
biting
her
lips
and
stared
at
the
fire
which
cast
a
golden
glow
over
her
flowing
hair
and
naked
brown
arms
he
was
quite
unmanned
by
the
loveliness
of
the
picture
he
came
close
to
her
and
smiling
into
her
amazed
eyes
stroked
her
on
the
forehead
and
cheeks
three
times
she
gazed
up
at
him
motionless
with
mouth
she
seemed
scarcely
to
comprehend
what
was
happening
for
it
was
the
first
time
any
man
had
ever
stroked
her
cheek
what
the
matter
sweet
one
dearest
what
have
i
done
to
you
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
leaning
over
her
tell
me
why
you
rage
so
furiously
against
me
she
tried
to
speak
but
her
lips
would
not
obey
she
wanted
to
guard
herself
but
her
arms
sank
to
her
sides
listen
he
continued
i
delight
in
you
every
hour
that
i
see
you
every
day
you
grow
dearer
to
me
you
are
the
sunshine
of
the
house
but
you
keep
up
your
feud
with
me
just
as
if
i
were
positively
your
or
god
knows
what
monster
she
shut
her
eyes
and
swayed
as
if
she
must
lie
down
and
fall
asleep
and
look
here
he
began
again
if
i
have
teased
you
a
little
now
and
then
you
must
take
it
in
good
part
while
i
have
been
away
all
of
you
have
just
got
into
the
habit
of
doing
what
you
like
but
i
want
to
inculcate
method
and
order
and
you
too
my
dear
child
i
would
have
fall
in
with
my
rules
and
that
wo
be
so
difficult
for
i
shall
require
nothing
very
dreadful
of
you
will
you
agree
say
yes
please
do
me
the
favour
whereupon
she
dropped
down
on
the
wooden
stump
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
began
to
cry
bitterly
what
a
quaint
young
thing
it
is
he
thought
instead
of
throwing
herself
into
my
arms
which
i
as
a
good
uncle
deserve
she
sits
down
and
howls
he
placed
himself
beside
her
and
looked
down
on
her
head
slowly
half
uncertain
he
raised
his
left
hand
may
i
he
wondered
and
let
it
glide
gently
over
her
damp
hair
which
shone
red
as
a
fox
in
the
firelight
then
she
clung
with
both
hands
to
his
arm
and
leaning
her
head
against
it
whispered
still
sobbing
why
why
are
you
so
horrid
to
me
when
have
i
been
horrid
i
have
always
meant
to
be
good
to
you
child
really
will
you
really
be
good
to
me
of
course
my
child
he
stooped
and
was
going
to
kiss
her
on
the
forehead
but
as
at
this
moment
she
moved
her
head
sideways
it
happened
that
their
lips
rested
on
each
other
how
innocently
she
lets
herself
be
kissed
he
thought
and
then
suddenly
she
jumped
up
and
tore
out
of
the
room
as
fast
as
her
clattering
pattens
would
permit
he
ran
both
hands
through
his
hair
and
strode
like
one
possessed
up
and
down
the
uneven
tiles
of
the
kitchen
a
childlike
foolish
blissfulness
filled
his
soul
he
felt
as
if
he
was
again
fifteen
years
old
in
jackets
and
with
curly
hair
coming
home
triumphant
from
his
first
rendezvous
when
felicitas
had
given
him
her
first
kiss
felicitas
like
the
stab
of
a
knife
the
thought
of
her
pursued
him
but
the
next
minute
he
laughed
out
loud
and
raised
his
hands
in
proud
confidence
to
the
ceiling
the
kiss
of
the
innocent
child
had
opened
founts
of
youthful
gladness
within
him
if
he
dared
hope
one
day
to
win
this
young
heart
for
his
own
then
all
would
be
made
right
again
then
the
burden
of
guilt
borne
for
years
would
fall
of
itself
then
what
filled
his
life
with
vague
uneasiness
and
made
him
sometimes
not
know
himself
would
yield
to
peace
and
a
happy
state
of
mind
it
would
die
away
die
like
that
flickering
greedy
leaping
flame
which
now
at
last
had
sunk
and
lay
at
rest
in
a
dull
glow
and
when
he
turned
round
he
saw
that
the
grand
spectre
which
had
cast
its
shadow
hatchet
in
hand
on
the
wall
had
gone
too
his
mood
became
pleasantly
dreamy
he
rested
his
head
in
his
hands
and
his
foot
on
the
body
of
the
dog
that
lay
stretched
full
length
on
the
hearth
luxuriating
in
the
warmth
as
he
stared
at
the
red
ashes
an
earnest
of
how
his
future
was
to
shape
itself
made
him
feel
as
if
a
cool
hand
were
laid
soothingly
on
his
brow
he
must
have
sat
musing
thus
for
quite
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
the
bernard
barked
sounded
without
and
voices
how
glad
i
am
they
did
come
before
he
thought
full
of
gratitude
for
the
blessings
the
last
hour
or
so
had
rained
upon
him
he
went
out
a
long
waggonette
full
of
men
and
lights
stood
on
the
dyke
and
close
behind
it
one
of
the
smaller
halewitz
carriages
from
which
his
mother
voice
greeted
him
half
choked
by
tears
found
he
cried
gleefully
there
was
great
rejoicings
at
the
news
his
mother
climbed
down
from
the
carriage
followed
by
the
stout
who
was
laden
with
a
supply
of
dry
clothes
elly
had
of
course
given
wrong
directions
for
two
hours
the
carriages
had
been
driving
about
from
village
to
village
his
mother
went
into
the
house
with
the
clothes
and
begged
him
to
wait
outside
do
scold
her
he
called
after
her
on
the
threshold
she
has
already
had
her
share
i
hope
that
you
were
not
too
hard
on
her
she
exclaimed
he
felt
that
he
was
growing
red
and
did
not
meet
her
glance
it
was
a
long
time
before
any
one
came
out
again
the
servants
stamped
on
the
dyke
to
keep
their
feet
warm
the
brandy
bottle
circulated
the
maids
let
themselves
be
tickled
and
gave
a
suppressed
squeal
when
the
lads
went
too
far
some
of
them
hummed
now
and
again
a
snatch
of
song
he
leaned
against
his
grey
mare
sounds
and
shadows
passed
before
his
consciousness
like
a
dream
at
last
after
about
half
an
hour
she
appeared
holding
his
mother
hand
in
the
doorway
her
head
wrapped
in
a
woollen
shawl
and
a
wide
flung
round
her
the
servants
wanted
to
cheer
but
he
forbade
any
demonstration
just
think
protested
grandmamma
while
her
eyes
beamed
with
delight
the
little
rogue
did
not
want
to
come
away
a
bit
only
when
i
had
promised
that
mamselle
should
stay
and
tend
the
sick
woman
would
she
graciously
condescend
to
follow
me
hertha
cast
down
her
eyes
and
was
smiling
coy
dreamy
smiles
when
she
came
into
the
light
of
the
lanterns
he
saw
that
her
whole
face
was
radiant
with
great
excitement
her
cheeks
seemed
rounder
her
mouth
like
a
flower
what
a
charming
metamorphosis
he
thought
a
woman
all
in
a
minute
before
she
has
become
a
woman
and
when
they
had
settled
her
comfortably
in
her
corner
they
began
the
homeward
journey
he
put
a
short
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
rode
in
the
wake
of
the
carriage
a
soft
breeze
had
risen
and
drove
the
mist
in
his
face
the
grasshoppers
were
silent
and
a
great
stillness
lay
on
the
world
slowly
he
recalled
one
sweet
picture
after
the
other
and
as
they
passed
before
his
mind
eye
one
in
particular
arrested
him
how
expectantly
her
lips
had
been
rounded
to
receive
his
threatened
kiss
and
to
return
it
with
emphasis
he
felt
the
impression
of
it
still
he
felt
too
the
thin
outline
of
the
slight
young
form
as
his
arm
had
encircled
it
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
something
spoke
within
him
hurt
the
child
do
carry
on
a
flirtation
xiv
when
leo
entered
his
bedroom
towards
two
in
the
morning
in
passing
the
little
table
by
the
bedside
a
penetrating
and
peculiar
perfume
met
him
a
perfume
that
years
before
had
often
clung
to
his
clothes
and
person
astonished
he
turned
the
marble
salver
upside
down
and
between
newspapers
and
books
found
a
small
note
with
the
device
in
silver
of
a
baron
coronet
and
a
carrier
pigeon
beneath
it
on
the
outside
the
handwriting
was
disguised
nevertheless
he
recognised
it
at
a
first
glance
and
turned
pale
he
tore
open
the
envelope
with
trembling
fingers
the
contents
were
as
follows
leo
i
trust
you
and
i
trust
myself
to
make
a
meeting
between
us
possible
it
would
be
simply
cowardice
to
avoid
it
any
longer
it
is
time
that
we
arrived
at
a
clear
understanding
with
regard
to
our
position
to
each
other
and
to
the
outside
world
i
will
wait
for
you
every
morning
when
the
fog
lies
on
the
stream
at
the
isle
of
friendship
for
the
sake
of
one
who
is
dear
to
us
both
i
conjure
you
to
come
our
unhappiness
makes
it
imperative
that
you
should
come
with
a
harsh
laugh
he
cast
the
note
from
him
it
flew
between
the
and
rested
on
the
pillow
this
was
too
good
he
had
struggled
with
himself
honestly
weary
days
and
nights
resisted
and
been
proof
against
the
excommunication
of
scripture
the
appeals
of
honour
and
friendship
the
exhorting
of
his
own
conscience
and
now
was
all
his
defiance
and
hardihood
to
be
swept
away
by
this
small
clandestine
billet
but
what
can
i
do
he
murmured
seeing
his
position
with
sudden
distinctness
i
am
in
for
it
still
there
should
be
no
question
of
repentance
let
all
the
priests
and
all
the
hysterical
women
of
the
earth
enter
into
a
conspiracy
of
vengeance
against
him
he
would
yet
remain
true
to
himself
and
his
principle
in
one
thing
however
johanna
had
been
right
if
felicitas
did
not
understand
what
was
due
to
the
honour
of
her
house
he
must
be
the
first
and
only
one
to
remind
her
of
her
duty
if
it
was
true
that
their
common
guilt
had
really
given
him
a
power
over
her
weak
and
vacillating
nature
he
must
use
that
power
for
ulrich
welfare
it
would
indeed
be
cowardice
not
to
do
so
besides
she
was
so
vain
that
she
might
easily
interpret
his
avoiding
her
as
a
sign
that
he
was
afraid
to
meet
her
because
he
had
preserved
the
old
passion
intact
in
his
heart
all
these
years
with
doglike
fidelity
nothing
could
be
more
absurd
than
such
an
idea
indeed
he
never
could
have
believed
that
love
for
a
woman
which
had
amounted
almost
to
madness
could
have
been
so
completely
lived
down
he
blew
over
the
point
of
his
not
so
much
as
that
even
remained
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
ulrich
might
rest
in
peace
and
then
he
recoiled
before
this
impure
train
of
thought
his
eye
wandered
to
the
wall
above
where
was
the
smooth
wooden
case
within
which
reposed
a
pair
of
unfailing
comforters
that
formerly
he
had
thought
a
thousand
times
of
resorting
to
in
a
distressful
situation
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
and
rehearsed
the
declamatory
speech
he
would
make
to
her
when
they
met
woman
he
would
say
have
you
not
a
spark
of
shame
in
your
composition
that
you
sacrifice
the
dignity
and
good
name
of
the
best
and
noblest
of
men
to
your
childish
folly
has
your
own
sense
of
guilt
taught
you
to
take
life
more
seriously
just
then
he
passed
the
mirror
a
fleeting
glance
at
it
showed
him
to
his
satisfaction
how
tall
and
powerful
and
full
of
he
would
appear
before
her
the
beautiful
smiling
sinner
our
unhappiness
makes
it
imperative
her
letter
had
closed
with
that
hollow
phrase
it
could
mean
nothing
the
child
banishment
the
only
event
that
could
cast
a
shadow
on
her
existence
had
been
her
own
deliberate
choice
anger
rose
within
him
she
shall
answer
for
it
he
cried
and
shook
his
fists
then
in
sudden
need
of
air
he
tore
open
a
window
and
leaned
out
drinking
in
the
cool
damp
night
over
there
in
the
corner
gable
was
the
girls
bedroom
the
hours
that
had
just
gone
by
occurred
to
him
how
entirely
they
had
vanished
and
all
that
had
happened
in
them
seemed
a
dream
he
shut
the
window
burnt
the
letter
and
undressed
for
he
wanted
to
sleep
for
the
two
hours
still
left
to
him
from
habit
he
was
going
to
place
beside
his
watch
and
purse
on
the
bedside
table
the
ring
he
had
been
wearing
when
he
hesitated
it
was
one
felicitas
had
given
him
in
return
for
a
diamond
one
of
his
he
contemplated
the
slender
hoop
with
the
line
of
sapphires
through
the
facets
of
which
broke
a
play
of
light
and
fire
then
he
examined
the
inside
where
close
to
their
initials
was
inscribed
the
date
of
a
memorable
and
fateful
day
the
custom
of
wearing
the
ring
had
become
so
mechanical
that
he
had
kept
it
on
his
finger
long
after
the
last
spark
of
his
passion
for
the
giver
had
been
utterly
extinguished
now
you
had
better
leave
it
off
he
said
to
himself
for
if
she
saw
it
on
his
finger
she
might
easily
draw
her
own
conclusions
he
determined
when
morning
came
to
lock
it
away
for
ever
as
he
threw
himself
on
the
bed
and
settled
his
head
in
the
pillows
he
started
up
again
horrified
for
some
demon
seemed
to
have
enveloped
him
in
the
scent
which
the
letter
of
his
former
mistress
had
brought
home
to
his
senses
and
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
hurled
the
sheet
of
paper
on
the
bed
and
it
had
evidently
left
its
traces
behind
and
though
he
turned
and
shook
the
pillow
and
finally
tossed
it
out
of
bed
that
powerful
odour
a
mixture
of
iris
and
opoponax
with
which
everything
around
her
was
saturated
a
sort
of
symbol
of
herself
the
cursed
odour
would
not
budge
it
tortured
him
with
hateful
dreams
one
minute
and
the
next
brought
him
back
to
a
grim
awakening
at
five
the
gate
watchman
long
pole
knocked
on
the
according
to
custom
he
jumped
up
with
his
head
on
fire
the
blood
racing
and
thumping
in
his
temples
the
morning
douche
did
not
brace
him
he
scarcely
felt
the
cold
water
as
it
ran
down
his
slackened
limbs
the
weather
was
favourable
for
the
mist
of
the
night
shrouded
the
garden
the
obelisk
was
a
mere
shadow
and
there
was
not
a
trace
of
the
trees
to
be
seen
there
was
not
the
slightest
fear
of
being
observed
from
uhlenfelde
if
he
approached
the
island
by
boat
why
then
should
he
put
it
off
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
was
galloping
along
the
high
road
under
the
dripping
branches
he
was
obliged
to
take
the
round
by
wengern
as
the
only
boat
the
nearer
boasted
had
sailed
away
with
hertha
the
day
before
he
left
his
horse
at
the
farm
and
walked
down
to
the
ferry
with
no
spring
in
his
step
he
was
scarcely
yet
awake
to
what
he
was
doing
that
in
the
next
hour
he
would
be
standing
face
to
face
with
the
woman
who
had
played
the
part
of
fate
in
his
life
seemed
incredible
and
at
the
same
time
a
matter
of
indifference
he
walked
on
like
a
somnambulist
only
a
pressure
about
his
skull
a
tormenting
contraction
of
his
breast
intimated
dully
that
the
path
he
was
taking
might
lead
to
significant
events
old
jürgens
could
not
contain
his
astonishment
at
sight
of
his
master
out
on
foot
at
such
an
ungodly
hour
of
the
morning
he
got
the
boat
ready
for
him
in
garrulous
haste
distributing
by
the
way
all
sorts
of
advice
and
warnings
and
let
the
frail
craft
sink
low
in
the
water
to
ensure
the
master
having
a
comfortable
push
off
but
he
had
not
dreamed
of
the
bright
which
dropped
into
his
hand
at
parting
now
he
knew
what
service
was
expected
of
him
it
was
the
same
as
of
old
keep
your
mouth
shut
as
leo
moved
through
the
mist
over
the
grey
eddying
water
he
felt
the
pressure
which
had
weighed
on
the
top
of
his
head
clasp
his
forehead
like
an
iron
ring
as
if
it
would
crush
in
his
very
brains
his
limp
arms
had
scarcely
strength
enough
to
keep
firm
hold
of
the
oars
he
let
himself
drift
almost
unconsciously
the
watery
vapours
welled
and
whirled
all
around
him
they
rose
and
rocked
like
masses
of
jelly
that
had
been
invisibly
shaken
and
then
sank
again
here
and
there
the
sun
made
its
way
in
shafts
through
the
milky
thickness
cut
circles
of
light
on
the
water
and
then
by
tremulous
waves
of
mist
was
forced
back
and
obscured
the
water
seemed
to
be
rising
hungrily
in
small
bubbles
that
swam
about
everywhere
and
were
driven
by
the
circling
ripples
into
the
centre
of
the
stream
the
banks
had
disappeared
alone
on
the
halewitz
side
a
fantastic
mass
of
sedge
and
reeds
from
time
to
time
loomed
out
through
the
grey
vapour
then
from
the
distance
came
a
short
shrill
sound
like
cracked
it
was
ringing
for
the
servants
breakfast
at
uhlenfelde
the
hour
was
six
what
curious
customs
she
must
have
introduced
he
thought
when
she
is
able
to
slip
out
at
this
hour
unnoticed
not
once
but
day
after
day
he
drew
himself
up
yawned
and
let
the
cold
water
spray
over
him
anticipation
of
the
coming
interview
paralysed
his
limbs
like
a
load
of
chains
then
gradually
he
began
to
feel
brisker
every
stroke
of
the
oars
drove
the
blood
quicker
through
his
veins
and
the
first
reflection
that
this
renewed
strength
produced
in
him
was
turn
back
but
that
would
be
insane
folly
rather
he
ought
to
congratulate
himself
that
this
inevitable
meeting
had
been
arranged
in
such
a
natural
manner
there
would
be
no
necessity
to
set
foot
on
uhlenfelde
ground
neither
would
he
have
to
put
ulrich
off
with
subterfuges
and
afterwards
he
would
be
free
as
he
was
now
he
brought
the
oars
out
of
the
water
with
all
his
might
so
that
behind
him
gurgling
whirlpools
of
foam
dug
the
stream
depths
ulrich
peace
ulrich
happiness
that
was
a
goal
for
which
he
need
not
be
ashamed
to
strive
a
few
minutes
later
when
he
looked
round
he
saw
that
the
wall
of
fog
behind
the
keel
was
split
in
two
by
a
dark
shadow
standing
up
like
a
tower
his
heart
began
to
beat
with
violent
thumps
against
his
breast
you
are
behaving
just
as
if
you
were
still
in
love
with
her
he
said
trying
to
laugh
at
himself
the
boat
crunched
on
to
the
sand
of
the
the
only
one
that
the
island
boasted
the
bank
of
which
half
washed
away
by
the
encroachments
of
the
stream
rose
steeply
from
the
water
with
nothing
to
protect
it
but
a
tangle
of
roots
here
a
brook
that
divided
the
island
into
two
halves
had
hollowed
out
a
sheltered
little
cove
whose
calm
waters
could
provide
accommodation
for
three
boats
at
least
a
small
gleaming
white
sandbank
shaded
by
a
huge
canopy
of
alder
branches
formed
a
charming
nook
above
which
the
brook
murmured
and
babbled
as
it
came
tumbling
down
to
join
the
water
of
the
bay
in
a
circle
of
foam
leo
first
glance
fell
on
the
boat
which
a
long
polished
chain
stretching
over
the
sand
fastened
to
an
so
she
was
waiting
for
him
the
clouds
of
mist
that
floated
about
between
the
dripping
boughs
of
the
trees
and
became
immovable
veils
around
their
trunks
wrapped
the
interior
of
the
island
in
impenetrable
grey
not
a
sign
of
the
temple
even
was
visible
he
walked
slowly
by
along
the
brookside
up
the
incline
the
undergrowth
was
quite
a
wilderness
of
shrubs
and
thickets
through
which
a
long
irregular
path
had
been
pierced
a
scarf
hung
on
one
of
the
branches
instinctively
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
it
became
lighter
and
the
mist
lifted
the
blackberry
bushes
that
hitherto
had
densely
covered
the
floor
of
the
wood
with
their
thorny
brambles
now
sent
forth
arms
like
heralds
in
the
direction
of
the
lawn
which
was
set
in
the
midst
of
the
shrubs
on
the
highest
point
of
the
island
the
ripening
berries
and
glistened
through
the
leaves
and
big
drops
hung
on
the
thorns
not
far
from
the
edge
of
the
clearing
lay
the
old
sacrificial
stone
he
paused
beside
it
and
drew
a
deep
breath
stroking
with
a
trembling
hand
the
shattered
surface
to
the
hollows
of
which
scarlet
creepers
clung
looking
like
streams
of
spilt
blood
his
eye
sought
the
temple
that
resembled
somewhat
a
beroofed
tombstone
with
its
two
pillars
and
the
between
rising
out
of
the
mist
the
shivering
figure
of
a
woman
cowered
on
the
steps
she
was
leaning
against
the
pedestal
and
at
his
approach
slowly
raised
her
head
which
after
a
quick
melancholy
shy
glance
sank
again
into
the
upturned
palms
of
her
hands
but
that
one
brief
glance
was
enough
she
is
the
same
as
ever
he
thought
from
under
the
waterproof
hood
which
she
had
drawn
so
closely
round
her
forehead
and
cheeks
that
only
here
and
there
a
stray
lock
of
her
fair
hair
escaped
there
had
shone
forth
the
same
sweet
pale
face
which
had
once
held
his
senses
in
blissful
ecstasy
with
the
same
mysteriously
veiled
blue
eyes
and
the
same
pathetic
droop
at
the
corners
of
the
mouth
she
pressed
herself
closer
against
the
pedestal
and
made
no
attempt
to
get
up
as
bareheaded
he
stood
before
her
felicitas
he
cried
his
voice
sounded
hard
and
threatening
a
little
harder
perhaps
than
he
intended
the
answer
he
got
was
a
tearless
sob
which
shook
the
supple
rounded
figure
on
the
steps
without
looking
up
she
withdrew
her
left
hand
from
her
face
and
stretched
it
slowly
towards
him
with
a
limp
helpless
action
the
hand
seemed
to
fumble
for
the
one
that
should
meet
and
grasp
it
but
the
intention
of
greeting
her
in
so
friendly
a
manner
was
far
from
him
and
so
her
hand
fell
without
having
found
any
support
into
her
lap
as
a
wounded
bird
falls
to
the
ground
you
wished
to
speak
to
me
felicitas
he
said
now
she
let
her
right
hand
too
slide
from
her
face
and
the
melting
and
reproachful
look
she
cast
up
at
him
seemed
to
ask
have
i
deserved
this
of
you
she
has
aged
a
little
he
thought
looking
at
her
more
nearly
she
had
a
slightly
worn
appearance
although
the
oval
outline
of
her
profile
curved
in
soft
unbroken
firmness
into
her
rounded
chin
and
the
forehead
over
which
the
hair
curled
wildly
was
of
girlish
purity
and
smoothness
but
from
the
corners
of
the
eyes
downwards
delicate
extended
to
the
cheeks
the
mouth
seemed
to
have
sunk
and
on
the
brows
faint
carefully
drawn
lines
of
paint
had
caught
the
moisture
which
glistened
there
in
a
chain
of
dewdrops
extraordinary
he
thought
to
himself
repeating
the
reflections
of
the
night
how
completely
one
can
be
cured
of
love
for
a
woman
and
then
he
said
again
you
wished
to
speak
to
me
felicitas
in
a
low
hesitating
voice
she
asked
and
you
leo
have
not
wished
to
speak
to
me
no
he
answered
bluntly
the
corners
of
her
lips
trembled
in
a
sad
little
smile
which
invulnerable
as
he
felt
himself
to
be
sent
a
stab
to
his
soul
he
must
be
severe
but
not
too
rough
with
her
you
must
not
misunderstand
me
felicitas
he
continued
in
a
softer
tone
we
have
met
here
to
make
sugary
speeches
or
to
burrow
in
the
old
ashes
we
must
be
open
and
frank
with
each
other
however
painful
it
may
be
i
intend
to
hurt
you
very
much
she
breathed
more
freely
this
unqualified
declaration
of
hostilities
seemed
to
soothe
her
then
she
drooped
her
beautiful
head
humbly
first
of
all
he
went
on
so
that
there
may
be
no
cross
purposes
between
us
i
ask
you
have
you
any
regrets
for
what
once
existed
between
us
i
do
know
what
you
mean
she
said
softly
have
you
have
you
in
short
an
atom
of
liking
left
for
me
she
closed
her
eyes
and
shook
her
head
wearily
and
slowly
like
a
sick
woman
you
may
make
your
mind
quite
easy
on
that
point
she
said
still
with
lids
there
is
no
man
in
the
world
i
detest
as
much
as
you
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
quite
so
far
he
answered
with
a
forced
laugh
what
happened
between
us
was
only
what
was
bound
to
happen
as
a
natural
course
after
we
had
once
he
stopped
short
feeling
dimly
that
he
was
giving
confused
expression
to
his
thoughts
and
then
pulling
himself
together
with
an
effort
he
went
on
the
question
now
is
not
what
has
been
but
what
and
whether
you
detest
me
or
not
is
of
no
consequence
as
i
am
here
i
feel
that
i
have
the
right
to
put
a
few
questions
to
you
you
certainly
must
answer
them
for
i
stand
before
you
as
your
husband
friend
she
smiled
up
at
him
resigned
to
her
fate
ask
what
you
like
she
whispered
is
it
true
what
the
gossip
of
the
neighbourhood
reports
that
you
that
you
are
deceiving
ulrich
simply
and
quietly
without
taking
her
veiled
eyes
from
his
face
she
replied
yes
it
seemed
to
him
almost
as
if
the
masonry
of
the
pedestal
against
which
she
leaned
was
going
to
fall
on
her
he
was
furious
and
disgusted
and
pointing
his
outstretched
fingers
at
her
he
called
her
name
in
a
choked
voice
with
her
perpetual
smile
she
folded
her
hands
and
said
i
deceive
him
every
day
and
every
hour
leo
my
life
is
a
disgraceful
sham
ulrich
at
my
side
is
in
hell
who
is
the
scoundrel
he
asked
grinding
his
teeth
tell
me
his
name
you
shall
not
go
away
from
here
alive
unless
you
tell
me
his
name
well
why
should
i
tell
you
she
answered
with
the
same
mysterious
smile
his
name
is
leo
sellenthin
he
fell
back
against
the
wall
of
the
temple
with
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
after
all
she
was
only
acting
thank
god
thank
god
listen
felicitas
he
said
then
i
am
not
here
to
be
humbugged
still
you
have
not
mentioned
my
name
for
nothing
therefore
you
shall
answer
a
second
question
why
how
could
you
dare
at
the
time
when
i
was
as
good
as
dead
keeping
dark
you
know
what
how
could
you
dare
to
become
ulrich
wife
her
smile
became
more
pronounced
it
would
seem
as
if
she
positively
gloried
in
his
anger
but
she
said
nothing
were
you
not
afraid
he
asked
that
i
should
ruin
you
for
this
deception
when
once
i
came
back
i
hoped
so
she
said
raising
her
folded
hands
a
little
off
her
lap
felicitas
he
answered
i
warn
you
let
this
masquerading
alone
you
can
gain
nothing
by
it
with
me
again
i
ask
you
how
could
you
then
she
raised
both
hands
quite
and
entreated
do
bully
me
bully
me
well
then
speak
i
will
tell
you
everything
everything
she
assured
him
only
you
will
have
patience
with
me
say
that
you
will
leo
of
course
yes
you
see
at
that
time
i
must
confess
it
to
you
at
that
time
my
love
for
you
was
not
yet
plucked
out
of
my
heart
and
as
you
see
it
was
impossible
that
we
should
come
together
after
rhaden
death
why
was
it
impossible
he
broke
in
did
i
not
on
the
night
of
the
duel
go
down
on
my
knees
and
conjure
you
to
fly
with
me
why
should
we
have
begun
a
new
life
together
over
in
america
or
some
other
part
of
the
world
if
our
love
was
serious
i
had
resolved
to
sacrifice
all
for
you
but
you
well
all
that
is
over
let
us
not
refer
to
it
again
as
it
was
impossible
that
we
could
come
together
you
were
saying
so
i
wanted
at
least
one
thing
she
confessed
do
look
at
me
please
i
wanted
at
least
to
be
near
you
he
could
scarcely
grasp
what
he
heard
it
was
so
horrible
as
ulrich
wife
he
stammered
felicitas
think
what
you
are
saying
she
shook
her
head
smiling
i
did
mean
that
she
whispered
do
think
so
badly
of
me
all
i
wanted
was
sometimes
to
see
you
to
hear
your
voice
to
refresh
my
ears
with
your
old
laugh
for
forget
i
still
loved
you
if
i
sinned
it
was
out
of
love
for
you
reproach
me
for
it
if
you
can
he
could
not
his
sister
had
been
right
it
was
not
easy
to
play
the
judge
when
one
was
a
at
the
bar
let
us
leave
that
time
out
of
the
question
he
said
after
a
silence
i
have
got
my
answer
and
that
is
enough
but
we
have
more
before
us
now
it
is
the
present
not
the
past
that
we
are
concerned
with
is
it
true
felicitas
that
you
have
a
train
of
admirers
hanging
after
you
and
that
you
encourage
them
to
make
love
to
you
in
ulrich
house
yes
she
replied
beginning
her
smile
anew
is
it
true
that
they
write
you
letters
full
of
gallantries
and
that
you
answer
them
in
the
same
strain
yes
and
in
spite
of
all
that
felicitas
in
spite
of
all
that
leo
he
felt
once
more
as
if
his
fury
would
overmaster
him
he
was
almost
suffocated
by
it
and
he
had
to
put
restraint
on
himself
not
to
fly
at
her
as
she
stood
there
in
her
defenceless
beauty
smiling
up
at
him
my
god
speak
he
thundered
you
have
questioned
me
and
i
have
answered
what
more
do
you
wish
me
to
do
to
justify
yourself
i
ca
justify
myself
if
you
would
like
to
kill
me
do
it
here
i
am
at
your
mercy
my
wretchedness
is
unspeakable
death
would
be
joy
in
comparison
and
still
she
smiled
if
it
was
all
hypocrisy
she
would
cry
not
smile
he
reasoned
but
i
tell
you
everything
she
continued
confess
to
you
as
one
criminal
confesses
to
another
who
is
bound
with
him
on
the
galleys
for
so
you
are
bound
to
me
leo
in
unexpiated
sin
in
guilt
and
in
tears
she
stood
before
him
with
raised
arms
like
a
perfect
statue
of
the
repenting
magdalene
a
thrill
alike
of
horror
and
admiration
ran
through
him
he
knew
that
it
was
the
language
of
the
novelette
in
which
she
spoke
nevertheless
her
phrases
so
moved
and
touched
him
that
his
brain
began
to
whirl
she
had
come
a
step
nearer
to
him
and
stood
confronting
him
with
a
face
as
white
as
a
sheet
her
breast
heaving
and
her
lips
trembling
when
i
became
his
wife
she
began
when
i
lay
in
his
arms
the
first
time
i
had
convulsions
of
fear
i
thought
i
saw
leo
standing
by
the
bed
with
cocked
pistol
pointed
at
my
forehead
and
this
vision
did
leave
me
till
i
was
alone
so
you
can
imagine
there
has
not
been
much
joy
in
our
union
he
is
as
unhappy
as
i
am
but
his
unhappiness
seems
to
me
bliss
compared
with
the
torments
that
i
have
had
to
endure
helpless
alone
like
a
fish
out
of
water
struggling
on
the
sand
and
slowly
expiring
till
then
leo
i
had
preserved
my
love
for
you
in
my
heart
as
something
sacred
but
after
that
it
began
to
yield
to
a
constant
gnawing
anxiety
fear
of
you
fear
of
him
fear
of
johanna
fear
of
the
whole
world
even
when
i
was
engaged
i
had
an
attack
of
it
i
thought
that
my
letters
to
you
i
know
he
interrupted
johanna
told
me
she
bowed
her
beautiful
head
with
a
gesture
of
pain
oh
now
i
see
who
it
is
has
hounded
you
on
to
me
she
whispered
but
she
is
right
i
am
every
bit
as
bad
every
bit
as
corrupt
as
her
hate
makes
me
out
he
on
his
side
interpreted
all
these
passionate
into
the
one
reproach
that
his
sister
had
prophesied
the
reproach
it
is
your
fault
do
exaggerate
he
said
trying
at
the
same
time
to
reassure
himself
it
not
so
bad
as
that
she
gave
a
deep
sigh
of
exhaustion
and
leaned
her
head
comfortably
against
the
foot
of
the
white
figure
of
the
youth
that
stood
nearest
her
on
the
pedestal
thank
you
for
that
little
word
of
consolation
she
said
speaking
low
as
if
in
a
dream
it
is
the
first
that
i
have
heard
for
years
for
whom
had
i
to
go
to
in
my
distress
fright
and
remorse
even
the
damned
in
hell
have
companions
i
had
none
and
now
you
want
to
know
how
i
could
in
the
midst
of
my
misery
have
the
heart
to
plunge
into
a
whirl
of
frivolous
gaieties
and
encourage
strange
men
i
answer
you
that
i
sought
to
deaden
my
trouble
by
distractions
the
panacea
seemed
so
handy
and
to
offer
such
a
convenient
mask
i
dare
lie
to
you
you
see
leo
that
when
the
last
spark
of
my
love
for
you
had
burnt
away
extinguished
by
fear
and
remorse
my
last
my
sole
restraint
was
gone
i
despaired
of
there
being
any
good
in
me
and
a
voice
cried
daily
and
hourly
in
my
ears
you
may
slide
downhill
you
escape
your
fate
and
so
when
people
talked
of
love
to
me
i
forced
myself
to
smile
though
a
shudder
ran
through
my
limbs
by
night
i
cried
by
day
i
laughed
the
only
thing
worth
living
for
was
to
gratify
my
whims
so
i
was
goaded
more
and
more
into
despising
myself
often
when
i
noticed
ulrich
eyes
resting
on
me
sorrowfully
i
longed
to
throw
myself
at
his
feet
and
implore
him
to
save
me
but
immediately
the
ghost
of
my
guilt
guilt
leo
stood
behind
me
like
a
gigantic
monster
and
hissed
in
my
ear
you
sacrifice
yourself
you
must
not
betray
your
associate
thus
i
have
dragged
on
weighed
down
by
the
burden
the
awful
burden
of
silence
it
is
a
wonder
that
my
body
has
been
faithful
to
my
marriage
vows
so
that
i
do
not
stand
before
you
an
abandoned
woman
so
easily
might
i
have
been
hurled
over
the
precipice
through
despair
in
myself
she
was
silent
and
pressed
her
forehead
against
the
edge
of
the
pedestal
while
her
upstretched
hands
held
on
to
the
youth
foot
as
if
she
had
been
the
guardian
angel
instead
of
the
evil
genius
of
the
friendship
to
whose
symbol
she
clung
the
sun
began
to
break
through
the
mist
its
rays
lay
like
a
shimmering
golden
shell
on
the
sacrificial
stone
which
rose
from
the
glittering
dew
like
a
gigantic
pearl
butterflies
flashed
by
the
pillars
and
now
and
again
the
song
of
a
bird
sounded
softly
from
the
bushes
the
brook
which
sprang
out
of
the
earth
only
a
few
paces
from
the
temple
made
a
low
clicking
noise
then
hurried
away
babbling
into
the
valley
a
scornfully
laughing
witness
of
this
melancholy
conversation
leo
eyes
continued
fastened
on
his
former
mistress
he
was
completely
bewildered
as
to
how
to
act
towards
her
there
could
be
no
further
question
of
rebuke
and
blame
when
help
and
counsel
were
needed
and
might
save
her
yet
what
could
he
what
dared
he
do
for
her
without
heaping
guilt
on
guilt
and
introducing
fresh
deceit
into
the
house
of
his
unsuspecting
friend
lizzie
he
said
in
a
gentler
voice
you
summoned
me
here
what
do
you
want
how
can
you
ask
leo
i
ask
because
i
do
know
why
have
you
avoided
me
why
have
you
made
the
poor
innocent
child
a
pretext
for
shunning
uhlenfelde
i
used
to
think
you
had
more
courage
leo
this
gave
affairs
an
unexpected
turn
i
did
not
think
further
intercourse
between
us
was
possible
lizzie
he
said
for
both
our
sakes
as
well
as
for
your
husband
and
the
world
for
what
would
the
world
say
if
it
saw
us
interchanging
courtesies
again
how
calmly
you
ask
the
question
she
answered
looking
in
front
of
her
with
her
sweet
smile
i
have
to
think
of
you
in
this
matter
as
well
as
of
myself
he
replied
and
certainly
i
gathered
from
what
ulrich
said
that
you
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
a
meeting
above
all
it
was
your
wish
that
my
harmless
meetings
with
him
should
cease
what
else
could
i
do
she
said
after
you
had
expressed
yourself
so
harshly
about
the
child
harshly
felicitas
take
care
what
you
say
i
have
considered
the
child
good
i
would
not
have
him
taught
to
love
me
and
then
learn
to
hate
me
and
you
too
and
yet
you
intended
to
take
him
with
us
to
america
she
answered
obstinately
that
would
have
been
quite
a
different
thing
lizzie
there
no
one
would
have
known
who
i
was
i
should
have
passed
as
his
father
but
here
where
every
but
my
god
why
do
i
waste
words
you
yourself
must
have
thought
of
it
long
ago
otherwise
you
would
have
sent
him
so
far
away
the
child
is
gone
she
said
in
a
low
tone
every
night
i
pray
and
weep
for
him
but
he
is
out
of
your
way
he
gave
a
start
of
horror
then
is
felicitas
he
stammered
that
is
why
you
sent
him
if
you
wish
to
rebuke
me
for
being
a
bad
mother
she
said
do
it
i
wo
defend
myself
she
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
looked
into
the
distance
with
appealing
helplessness
ah
it
cost
me
a
severe
struggle
she
continued
as
if
talking
to
herself
every
night
my
poor
boy
appeared
to
me
in
my
dreams
and
i
became
icy
cold
when
i
saw
how
pale
and
wretched
he
looked
but
i
told
myself
he
is
young
he
will
fight
it
through
live
and
be
happy
but
i
well
you
see
leo
that
this
is
my
last
battle
i
know
it
the
torture
of
having
to
keep
silence
ca
be
borne
much
longer
remorse
chokes
me
had
i
kept
the
child
i
must
have
given
up
you
the
only
person
who
can
help
and
advise
me
and
give
me
any
comfort
what
could
i
have
done
then
but
have
thrown
myself
in
the
river
for
they
say
in
death
it
is
easy
to
be
silent
emotion
and
suspicion
fought
within
him
for
the
mastery
if
she
was
capable
of
making
such
a
tremendous
sacrifice
for
him
it
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
saying
i
love
you
i
love
you
still
she
guessed
his
thoughts
do
misunderstand
me
she
began
again
and
think
that
i
am
trying
to
win
you
by
tricks
look
at
me
leo
i
am
a
mass
of
lies
and
deceit
my
very
face
seems
given
me
to
dazzle
and
mislead
but
hell
is
in
my
soul
and
as
sure
as
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
so
sure
as
ulrich
is
sacred
to
us
both
he
is
to
you
he
asked
eagerly
drawing
a
step
nearer
to
her
yes
she
raised
her
fingers
voluntarily
as
if
to
take
her
oath
upon
it
the
expression
of
her
eyes
was
pure
and
grave
give
me
your
hand
he
said
she
laid
her
fingers
quietly
in
his
right
hand
and
as
she
did
so
her
glance
fell
on
the
sapphire
hoop
leo
said
she
with
a
sad
little
laugh
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
still
wear
my
ring
he
recoiled
from
her
oh
fatal
cursed
forgetfulness
instead
of
locking
it
away
when
he
got
up
that
morning
he
had
stuck
it
on
his
finger
as
usual
do
look
so
alarmed
she
went
on
the
poor
ring
has
done
nothing
go
on
wearing
it
once
it
served
as
a
symbol
of
our
common
sin
for
the
future
it
shall
tell
us
that
we
are
as
one
in
being
truly
penitent
for
what
has
happened
and
if
we
ourselves
can
never
be
happy
again
we
will
at
least
unite
in
making
another
happy
who
must
be
dearer
to
us
than
each
other
that
is
an
excellent
sentiment
felicitas
he
said
and
if
you
keep
to
it
all
may
yet
be
well
if
you
help
me
i
certainly
will
he
knew
what
she
was
aiming
at
it
was
the
same
demand
as
the
and
johanna
he
felt
humbled
they
were
all
of
the
same
opinion
that
there
was
only
one
road
to
complete
expiation
therefore
he
supposed
they
must
be
right
repent
nothing
had
persistently
been
his
watchword
but
after
all
he
need
not
relinquish
it
when
sure
of
his
strength
he
entered
his
friend
house
to
bring
into
it
the
sunshine
it
lacked
and
while
he
was
meditating
thus
he
suddenly
beheld
the
woman
lying
at
his
feet
her
hood
had
slipped
back
on
her
neck
and
the
mass
of
fair
hair
loosely
tied
with
a
blue
ribbon
framed
the
lovely
melancholy
white
face
in
a
thousand
shining
waves
and
little
curls
he
bent
down
horrified
to
raise
her
but
she
resisted
let
me
clasp
your
knees
she
implored
i
will
not
stand
up
till
i
know
that
i
am
not
any
more
alone
and
forsaken
in
my
sin
that
you
will
support
me
when
penitence
tears
my
heart
so
that
i
need
no
longer
be
silent
and
despairing
i
will
help
you
felicitas
he
said
only
do
stand
up
her
hands
felt
for
his
when
will
you
come
she
asked
beseechingly
when
you
like
come
she
begged
he
pines
for
you
how
long
has
he
been
back
three
days
say
you
wanted
to
speak
to
me
that
is
enough
you
are
coming
yes
i
will
come
she
thrilled
with
pleasure
i
promise
you
she
said
that
i
will
no
longer
regard
you
as
my
bitterest
enemy
that
i
will
do
my
best
to
make
you
happy
it
is
not
i
you
have
to
think
of
he
replied
but
ulrich
will
you
make
ulrich
happy
she
shrank
from
him
slightly
yes
i
will
she
said
in
a
toneless
voice
ten
minutes
later
the
white
boat
put
off
from
the
leo
watched
it
from
behind
the
bushes
she
did
not
wave
her
hand
in
farewell
neither
did
she
look
round
and
he
felt
grateful
to
her
for
it
when
she
landed
on
the
opposite
bank
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
she
sank
on
the
ground
for
a
moment
because
she
was
either
exhausted
or
crying
he
turned
back
to
the
temple
deep
in
thought
the
mist
had
quite
dispersed
and
so
he
was
obliged
to
hang
about
the
island
in
hiding
for
another
hour
or
more
warm
noontide
sunlight
lay
on
the
lawn
wasps
with
wide
outspread
wings
floated
humming
about
the
blackberry
clusters
a
crawled
lazily
over
the
pebbles
now
and
then
there
came
from
the
halewitz
fields
a
jocund
cry
which
slowly
died
away
on
the
air
it
was
the
ploughman
working
not
far
from
the
river
yonder
lay
his
acres
his
work
his
happiness
plagued
by
restlessness
he
ran
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
temple
the
statues
looking
down
on
him
indifferently
with
their
frozen
smile
the
soft
sandstone
out
of
which
they
were
sculptured
had
begun
to
decay
the
faces
had
grown
wrinkled
and
were
full
of
scars
and
pits
as
if
the
leaves
had
rotted
them
the
arm
of
one
was
shattered
as
far
as
the
elbow
and
the
stump
projected
from
the
upper
part
of
the
body
like
a
post
nailed
into
the
flesh
we
must
get
you
restored
you
poor
fellow
he
said
and
drew
himself
erect
with
a
sigh
xv
hertha
awoke
the
flies
buzzed
about
in
the
purple
duskiness
broad
midday
sunshine
came
through
the
chinks
of
the
shutters
and
the
red
curtains
i
must
have
dreamed
it
she
thought
laying
her
arm
beneath
her
head
and
laughing
up
blissfully
at
the
ceiling
and
then
she
slowly
realised
that
this
time
it
could
be
no
dream
a
warm
glow
flooded
her
face
she
shut
her
eyes
and
did
think
it
seemed
as
if
her
body
were
drifting
and
as
if
she
must
die
of
happiness
what
had
her
existence
been
yesterday
and
what
was
it
a
wild
hoyden
had
been
carried
down
the
stream
and
then
he
had
found
her
and
made
her
a
woman
with
the
magic
of
his
love
she
jumped
out
of
bed
with
a
sharp
exclamation
and
began
to
dress
when
she
stood
before
the
glass
she
contemplated
herself
for
a
long
time
how
funny
she
said
i
look
the
same
as
usual
she
passed
elly
bed
on
tiptoe
the
girl
was
sleeping
away
her
tears
and
fright
of
the
day
before
in
rosy
peaceful
slumbers
a
fly
had
alighted
on
the
corner
of
one
of
her
eyelids
hertha
flicked
it
off
and
talks
about
love
she
thought
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
as
was
always
the
case
when
she
tried
to
put
herself
in
the
place
of
her
companion
with
her
childish
objectless
mind
a
deadening
flat
feeling
came
over
her
which
robbed
her
of
the
courage
to
believe
in
the
happy
result
of
what
had
happened
yesterday
perhaps
on
further
consideration
he
would
find
her
wanting
in
seriousness
and
would
take
back
his
declaration
the
next
minute
she
was
ashamed
of
her
it
was
inconceivable
that
he
had
not
perfectly
understood
how
boundless
her
love
for
him
was
and
how
in
spite
of
her
extreme
youth
her
early
experience
of
the
sorrows
and
trials
of
life
had
ripened
and
strengthened
her
character
ten
sounded
from
the
clock
tower
she
was
alarmed
at
its
being
so
late
she
would
share
every
joy
and
sorrow
and
pursuit
with
the
beloved
in
future
even
early
rising
and
she
resolved
to
get
up
with
the
as
of
old
when
she
used
to
go
to
the
milking
creeping
about
on
naked
feet
she
went
on
with
her
toilette
it
was
a
mercy
that
elly
did
wake
what
torture
it
would
have
been
if
these
first
holy
hours
had
had
to
be
frittered
away
in
idle
chatter
at
first
she
thought
of
putting
on
her
light
batiste
frock
the
one
with
the
pattern
that
suited
her
best
and
looked
so
fresh
and
festive
surely
was
a
festival
the
behest
of
her
life
and
in
half
joy
her
trembling
soul
scarcely
dared
look
forward
to
the
glory
it
was
to
bring
forth
then
she
gave
up
the
idea
she
would
make
herself
gay
and
smart
rather
would
she
meet
him
modestly
and
neatly
arrayed
so
she
chose
a
dress
of
dark
tweed
and
only
relieved
it
with
a
jabot
of
pale
blue
and
lace
at
the
neck
this
she
thought
gave
her
a
sufficiently
languishing
look
and
suited
her
complexion
the
bernard
bark
called
her
beneath
the
window
he
was
roaming
about
the
garden
masterless
sniffing
along
the
gravel
paths
she
stretched
her
arms
out
to
him
joyously
her
tenderness
for
him
knew
no
bounds
a
pity
he
is
not
a
man
she
thought
i
would
love
him
as
my
brother
then
she
left
the
room
with
her
high
boots
in
her
hand
for
she
did
not
dare
put
them
on
till
she
was
in
the
corridor
the
dog
sprang
up
at
her
boisterously
from
behind
the
garden
door
where
he
had
been
waiting
for
her
she
buried
her
face
in
his
leonine
coat
to
hide
her
burning
blushes
if
she
blushed
at
sight
of
the
dog
simply
because
he
had
been
a
witness
of
yesterday
events
how
should
she
be
able
to
conceal
the
treacherous
glow
when
she
met
his
master
the
with
its
snowy
cloth
still
stood
on
the
terrace
three
unused
cups
shone
in
the
sun
it
looked
as
if
he
too
been
there
her
heart
beat
louder
did
fate
ordain
that
she
should
be
absolutely
with
him
what
would
he
have
to
say
to
her
what
she
to
him
the
thought
so
frightened
her
that
her
knees
trembled
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
she
thought
perhaps
i
shall
be
engaged
it
seemed
quite
terrible
almost
incredible
and
how
should
she
conduct
herself
in
this
trying
ordeal
i
must
not
just
fall
into
his
arms
thought
she
so
that
he
will
think
me
crude
in
everything
and
misunderstand
me
again
she
decided
to
cut
a
handful
of
roses
instead
of
the
usual
good
morning
she
would
greet
him
with
these
and
a
look
that
should
say
take
them
beloved
all
is
yours
all
she
selected
blooms
full
grown
with
a
wealth
of
curving
petals
each
one
would
speak
of
love
to
him
of
that
wild
entrancing
love
of
which
poets
sang
so
beautifully
from
whose
kisses
one
drank
either
eternal
bliss
or
damnation
nothing
pale
or
faded
should
have
a
place
in
her
bouquet
but
she
did
not
adorn
herself
with
a
rose
was
he
not
to
be
for
always
the
one
and
only
ornament
of
her
life
leo
the
dog
trotted
meanwhile
behind
her
well
satisfied
now
and
then
rubbing
his
nose
lovingly
against
her
sleeve
where
is
your
master
she
asked
him
with
a
sigh
the
beast
looked
up
in
her
face
with
comprehending
melancholy
eyes
for
hours
since
daybreak
he
had
been
looking
for
him
everywhere
but
he
had
ridden
off
on
a
secret
mission
without
asking
his
faithful
friend
to
bear
him
company
as
she
ascended
the
steps
of
the
terrace
grandmamma
came
to
meet
her
she
caught
hold
of
the
balustrade
trembling
what
if
he
had
already
confided
the
news
to
his
mother
was
she
coming
before
her
with
a
heart
whose
secret
had
been
laid
bare
she
ran
to
her
quickly
and
hid
her
head
on
her
breast
so
that
she
should
be
looked
at
the
old
lady
patted
her
full
of
solicitude
no
cold
i
hope
no
fever
she
asked
hertha
breathed
more
freely
ah
she
did
know
let
me
feel
your
pulse
grandmamma
commanded
hertha
wriggled
away
i
like
that
she
thought
of
all
days
to
have
my
pulse
felt
next
i
shall
be
asked
to
put
out
my
tongue
and
she
barricaded
herself
behind
the
table
grandmamma
made
the
best
of
a
bad
matter
but
she
was
not
going
to
let
her
off
without
a
lecture
hertha
with
quivering
lips
and
wandering
eyes
let
the
mild
outburst
pass
over
her
head
her
gaze
was
directed
to
leo
empty
her
ear
towards
the
courtyard
and
then
suddenly
the
hound
gave
a
howl
of
delight
ringing
clattering
footsteps
came
echoing
along
the
corridor
hertha
felt
her
blood
ebb
from
her
veins
and
as
if
she
must
at
his
glance
fall
dead
from
shame
she
dashed
the
roses
down
on
the
table
and
tore
at
hot
speed
into
the
garden
and
grandmamma
whose
lecture
was
in
full
swing
looked
after
her
in
consternation
there
was
a
nook
in
the
yew
hedge
which
ran
out
from
the
castle
into
the
garden
where
unseen
it
was
possible
to
hear
and
see
all
that
passed
on
the
terrace
there
she
quickly
concealed
herself
he
stood
framed
in
the
glass
door
heated
and
dusty
with
a
deep
frown
on
his
brow
which
terrified
hertha
grandmamma
gently
reproached
him
how
was
it
that
it
was
nearly
noon
and
nothing
had
been
seen
of
him
before
i
had
business
to
attend
to
was
his
curt
gruff
answer
then
he
sat
down
and
played
carelessly
with
the
scattered
roses
hertha
was
grieved
thus
her
pretty
little
plan
came
to
nothing
of
course
he
did
suspect
how
significant
those
roses
were
for
him
what
are
the
kids
doing
he
asked
hertha
started
she
did
deserve
to
be
called
by
such
a
name
as
that
but
she
comforted
herself
with
the
thought
that
he
was
trying
to
hide
his
secret
grandmamma
gave
him
the
desired
information
hertha
had
put
in
an
appearance
but
elly
was
still
asleep
she
might
have
grace
and
sleep
to
twelve
if
she
liked
the
longer
the
better
he
was
hungry
and
crumbled
the
toasted
rolls
impatiently
what
incapable
dog
of
a
cook
have
we
got
now
he
grumbled
grandmamma
stood
up
to
go
and
see
what
had
happened
in
the
kitchen
hertha
is
waiting
too
she
said
where
is
the
little
one
he
asked
she
has
scampered
away
from
you
once
more
like
a
frightened
hare
responded
grandmamma
i
will
send
her
out
if
i
see
her
with
which
she
went
into
the
house
hertha
saw
how
he
smiled
to
himself
for
a
moment
then
wrinkled
his
brows
again
in
heavy
thought
with
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
he
sat
brooding
there
infinite
compassion
awoke
in
hertha
he
has
been
bothered
by
some
new
trouble
she
thought
and
his
cares
make
his
head
ache
from
now
on
it
would
be
her
duty
to
stand
by
him
in
time
of
trial
whatever
her
mood
might
be
and
with
resolute
steps
digging
her
heels
into
the
ground
she
emerged
from
the
yew
hedge
but
when
she
reached
the
foot
of
the
terrace
she
reeled
and
was
obliged
to
pause
for
breath
she
had
never
imagined
that
one
could
feel
such
unspeakable
fear
of
the
man
one
loved
better
than
life
itself
now
she
was
at
the
top
of
the
steps
but
still
lost
in
meditation
he
did
not
look
up
he
held
one
of
the
roses
between
his
lips
and
chewed
the
stalk
she
was
trembling
so
much
that
she
had
to
steady
herself
by
holding
on
to
the
corner
of
the
table
how
should
she
greet
him
a
mere
good
morning
sounded
too
commonplace
and
everyday
she
sighed
then
at
last
he
looked
up
a
friendly
quiet
smile
beamed
on
his
face
good
morning
good
morning
he
said
quite
naturally
why
that
deep
sigh
have
we
caught
cold
a
touch
of
fever
eh
she
gazed
silently
at
him
with
great
wounded
eyes
these
were
almost
exactly
the
same
words
as
good
old
grandmamma
had
used
perhaps
he
too
was
going
to
ask
to
feel
her
pulse
her
hand
fluttered
in
his
then
she
sank
into
an
armchair
still
not
speaking
again
the
dread
overcame
her
that
after
thinking
it
over
he
had
decided
she
was
too
immature
and
would
treat
yesterday
as
if
it
had
never
been
and
she
would
have
no
means
of
combating
his
decision
and
making
him
act
otherwise
yes
yes
that
was
a
quaint
adventure
he
went
on
as
he
stretched
himself
and
put
his
hand
before
his
mouth
to
suppress
a
yawn
of
fatigue
but
we
caught
you
neatly
you
runaway
her
fears
increased
if
only
she
had
not
been
such
a
coward
such
an
unutterable
coward
she
would
have
drawn
herself
to
her
full
height
and
exclaimed
indignantly
why
do
you
despise
me
do
you
know
what
you
have
done
but
she
did
dare
move
an
eyelash
much
less
look
up
and
as
she
still
remained
he
bent
over
her
and
stroking
her
forehead
asked
her
grinning
have
we
made
peace
at
last
dear
child
this
was
a
ray
of
light
she
thanked
god
for
it
nodded
and
tried
to
smile
well
well
he
ejaculated
in
doubt
as
she
had
not
spoken
but
instead
of
an
answer
she
gathered
the
roses
together
and
offered
them
to
him
do
they
belong
to
me
he
asked
yes
to
you
she
whispered
with
a
shy
tender
light
in
her
eyes
dir
he
marked
the
expression
and
a
bitter
sense
of
a
marred
happiness
stabbed
his
soul
he
seized
the
little
brown
hand
in
gratitude
at
this
moment
steps
were
heard
in
the
the
glass
door
of
which
stood
open
grandmamma
is
coming
exclaimed
hertha
shocked
snatching
away
her
hand
well
let
her
come
he
said
in
some
surprise
then
as
grandmamma
appeared
followed
by
christian
he
relapsed
again
into
reverie
he
ate
and
drank
but
it
was
like
an
automaton
eating
and
drinking
her
eyes
did
not
move
from
his
face
she
dreaded
to
try
and
win
a
look
from
him
full
of
understanding
and
warm
feeling
yet
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
ceased
to
exist
for
him
she
might
be
stupid
and
of
course
she
was
but
this
much
she
knew
that
a
man
did
not
usually
treat
the
woman
of
his
choice
in
such
a
manner
meta
podewyl
for
instance
and
hans
sembritzky
were
in
love
with
each
other
for
a
long
time
before
he
declared
himself
they
called
each
other
herr
baron
and
gnädiges
fräulein
quite
stiffly
and
were
outwardly
like
strangers
but
their
eyes
could
not
deceive
them
they
spoke
a
glowing
language
which
made
all
formality
a
pretence
and
then
how
dreamily
and
blissfully
they
had
smiled
away
into
vacancy
when
their
eyes
might
no
longer
meet
but
he
oh
he
with
a
low
murmur
he
stood
up
shot
his
whistled
to
his
dog
and
strode
away
without
vouchsafing
her
another
look
without
another
look
later
the
same
thing
repeated
itself
hertha
sat
through
lunch
in
dull
misery
two
tears
fell
on
the
hands
that
nervously
crumbled
her
bread
grandmamma
had
been
sharply
observing
her
and
it
had
not
escaped
her
that
hertha
whose
healthy
appetite
was
proverbial
in
the
house
had
scarcely
swallowed
a
morsel
of
meat
she
slipped
noiselessly
out
of
her
seat
pushed
elly
aside
and
caught
hold
of
hertha
left
hand
she
jumped
up
as
if
she
had
been
pricked
by
a
needle
sit
down
and
give
me
your
wrist
commanded
grandmamma
further
resistance
was
useless
and
the
pulse
was
indeed
galloping
feverishly
then
she
was
asked
to
show
her
tongue
this
she
do
grandmamma
please
do
torment
me
she
begged
and
flung
her
arms
round
her
neck
bursting
into
tears
but
grandmamma
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
trifled
with
in
such
important
matters
show
me
your
tongue
she
insisted
but
the
tongue
was
still
not
forthcoming
then
ensued
a
sharp
tussle
in
which
hertha
was
defeated
and
this
was
how
she
was
treated
and
her
heartache
misunderstood
she
was
ordered
to
bed
and
told
she
must
perspire
xvi
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
leo
sellenthin
reined
in
his
mare
at
the
gateway
of
uhlenfelde
the
heraldic
sword
amidst
the
three
fish
pointed
warningly
down
on
him
from
the
escutcheon
of
the
kletzingks
above
the
entrance
as
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
brow
a
last
faint
turn
back
breathed
by
the
rustling
leaves
fell
on
his
ear
but
he
clenched
his
teeth
and
rode
on
to
the
left
on
the
same
side
as
the
stream
lay
the
house
a
white
bijou
structure
resembling
the
country
seat
of
a
parvenu
more
than
the
ancestral
castle
of
a
doughty
old
feudal
race
it
had
been
built
at
her
desire
for
the
former
gray
castellated
pile
had
not
found
favour
with
the
fair
new
mistress
two
female
figures
in
marble
representing
peace
and
hospitality
stretched
out
their
shining
arms
in
welcome
to
the
stranger
from
the
parapet
of
the
ramparts
which
were
approached
by
a
terraced
drive
groups
of
widespreading
palms
overarched
by
the
ragged
plumes
of
a
banana
filled
the
space
made
by
the
curve
of
the
drive
the
jagged
foliage
stretched
up
to
the
marble
figures
which
in
their
seemed
like
rare
exotic
blooms
in
this
wilderness
of
green
leo
turned
away
from
the
house
for
according
to
the
programme
he
was
not
to
meet

until
he
had
seen

the
spacious
courtyard
stretched
its
huge
length
before
his
eyes
ulrich
it
would
appear
had
been
building
without
a
pause
during
the
last
few
years
for
more
than
half
the
offices
and
had
been
rebuilt
where
once
the
long
white
clay
wall
covered
with
stubbly
thatch
had
stood
there
was
now
a
row
of
brick
palaces
with
iron
bolts
and
locks
stone
porches
and
a
system
of
covered
drainage
round
about
in
the
yard
drawn
up
in
columns
were
the
long
waggons
with
their
big
strong
axles
and
their
wood
agleam
there
were
the
ploughs
a
distinguished
regiment
beginning
with
a
bulky
ruchadlo
and
ending
with
the
slender
furrow
hedgehog
a
beautiful
fowler
steam
plough
with
double
shafts
and
an
engine
at
the
head
the
more
delicate
machines
lay
under
the
shelter
of
a
shed
the
drainers
and
the
and
the
newest
inventions
just
arrived
from
england
there
was
also
a
zimmermann
of
the
kind
leo
himself
so
earnestly
coveted
and
a
apparatus
for
setting
seed
a
feeling
of
admiration
untainted
by
envy
awoke
in
him
a
good
deal
that
he
had
only
seen
before
at
agricultural
exhibitions
where
he
had
been
apt
to
regard
it
all
scarcely
sympathetically
as
so
much
machinery
was
there
in
everyday
use
its
working
capabilities
tested
and
proved
in
another
place
on
wooden
blocks
boxes
out
of
the
potato
carts
lay
huddled
together
like
unslain
dragons
weltering
in
the
sun
near
the
stable
stood
a
company
of
kettles
in
which
during
the
winter
the
fodder
was
soaked
and
made
easy
for
the
mouths
of
the
cattle
to
masticate
to
crown
all
there
was
a
perfect
reservoir
designed
by
wolf
such
as
only
model
farms
could
afford
black
clouds
of
smoke
issued
from
the
tall
chimney
which
flanked
the
distillery
buildings
for
although
the
distillery
itself
was
not
this
moment
at
work
the
was
setting
in
motion
the
dairy
machinery
which
was
in
full
activity
long
rows
of
milkpails
were
ranged
near
it
facing
the
sun
snowy
white
with
hoops
the
tin
strainers
shining
as
bright
as
silver
the
and
and
all
sorts
of
implements
which
leo
even
know
by
sight
at
every
step
some
new
wonder
was
revealed
to
him
and
what
is
old
lumber
in
comparison
with
this
he
thought
then
a
solemn
mood
overtook
him
a
feeling
of
reverend
exultation
which
banished
all
his
fears
and
for
a
moment
let
him
forget
what
had
brought
him
there
if
it
was
within
human
possibility
to
accomplish
all
this
by
dint
of
energy
and
strength
of
purpose
why
should
not
he
succeed
in
a
like
achievement
he
had
only
to
push
on
steadily
from
the
point
at
which
he
had
begun
to
throw
himself
heart
and
soul
in
his
work
and
to
abandon
frivolity
and
philandering
for
evermore
the
elevating
example
of
his
friend
before
his
eyes
the
feeling
of
deliverance
which
it
would
give
him
to
procure
secretly
his
happiness
this
alone
would
prevent
his
making
shipwreck
again
of
his
career
as
he
drew
near
the
stable
a
groom
whom
he
did
not
know
met
him
and
smiled
up
in
his
face
with
familiar
impertinence
the
mistress
is
not
at
home
he
remarked
two
lots
have
had
to
ride
away
without
seeing
her
speak
when
you
are
spoken
to
fellow
leo
thundered
at
him
so
that
with
an
anxious
exclamation
he
nearly
jumped
out
of
his
skin
what
a
delightful
understanding
must
exist
between
servants
and
guests
when
a
complete
stranger
was
received
with
this
gratuitous
officiousness
and
how
it
was
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
that
his
visit
was
intended
for
the
fair
lady
of
the
house
he
sprang
out
of
the
saddle
and
was
told
that
the
master
was
with
the
horses
in
the
paddock
exercising
the
he
walked
in
that
direction
and
the
groom
who
was
probably
in
the
habit
of
being
tipped
by
his
mistress
admirers
glared
after
him
dumbfounded
on
the
miniature
racecourse
which
sloped
towards
the
stream
lanky
figure
was
to
be
seen
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
thoroughbred
colts
which
were
pressing
against
him
to
be
caressed
by
his
hand
leo
heart
smote
him
at
the
thought
of
the
comedy
of
deception
he
had
given
his
word
to
enact
and
the
victim
of
which
was
to
be
the
man
who
was
dearest
to
him
in
the
world
but
what
was
to
happen
was
to
be
for
his
happiness
and
his
peace
of
mind
therefore
he
must
go
forward
with
it
the
colts
at
his
approach
bounded
away
half
shyly
half
roguishly
ulrich
turned
round
pure
joy
succeeded
the
next
moment
by
horror
lit
up
his
emaciated
features
you
at
uhlenfelde
he
gasped
how
do
you
do
little
girl
cried
leo
forcing
himself
into
an
assumption
of
his
old
genial
manner
do
let
your
eyes
quite
start
out
of
your
head
you
can
set
the
dogs
on
me
to
chase
me
out
of
the
yard
if
i
am
not
welcome
and
then
he
repeated
his
lesson
how
he
felt
things
could
not
go
on
as
they
were
and
he
wanted
to
try
if
by
means
of
an
interview
with
felicitas
he
could
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
aversion
she
had
expressed
for
him
and
through
an
explanation
put
the
relations
between
them
on
a
more
tolerable
footing
therefore
he
besought
his
friend
to
go
indoors
and
beg
felicitas
to
see
him
a
smile
of
hopelessness
flitted
over
ulrich
face
it
is
altogether
useless
he
replied
i
am
sure
that
she
wo
receive
you
you
know
in
what
strong
terms
she
speaks
of
you
that
may
be
said
leo
without
daring
to
raise
his
eyes
from
the
ground
but
at
least
make
the
attempt
say
i
have
come
to
ask
her
pardon
anything
you
like
ulrich
reflected
and
then
said
very
well
come
it
shall
not
be
said
that
i
did
not
try
however
little
good
it
may
be
they
left
the
enclosure
surrounded
by
the
colts
who
had
begun
to
make
friendly
overtures
to
the
stranger
but
he
took
no
notice
of
them
mutely
he
walked
at
his
friend
side
now
and
then
giving
himself
a
shake
as
if
he
would
shake
off
from
his
soul
some
insupportable
horror
ulrich
stood
still
when
they
came
to
the
ramparts
in
case
she
does
consent
do
you
think
it
best
to
see
her
alone
he
asked
certainly
leo
replied
feeling
that
he
was
not
used
yet
to
the
distasteful
game
he
was
pledged
to
play
in
the
eyes
of
his
unsuspecting
friend
then
let
me
go
in
to
her
and
you
wait
out
here
forgive
me
he
added
but
unless
it
is
her
desire
i
can
not
permit
you
to
enter
the
house
consecrated
to
her
honour
leo
nearly
crushed
his
hand
in
his
own
but
he
had
the
courage
to
meet
the
eyes
that
rested
on
him
with
their
fiery
brilliance
melting
into
tenderness
he
watched
him
disappear
behind
the
statue
of
peace
he
fixed
his
gaze
absently
on
the
marble
woman
who
seemed
to
hold
out
her
towards
him
with
a
friendly
gesture
then
he
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
forecourt
with
long
strides
he
dared
not
think
of
what
was
going
on
indoors
at
that
moment
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
when
ulrich
glowing
from
excitement
his
long
neck
eagerly
thrust
forward
came
out
leo
well
old
fellow
it
was
difficult
leo
but
she
gives
her
consent
thank
you
a
hundred
times
uli
he
stammered
and
blushed
like
a
lying
schoolboy
so
far
she
has
only
one
end
in
view
ulrich
continued
that
is
to
send
you
home
humiliated
and
wretched
but
you
must
see
what
you
can
do
with
her
my
boy
and
think
of
the
fever
i
am
in
meanwhile
yes
he
really
was
feverish
his
hands
trembled
and
the
blood
throbbed
in
his
temples
he
led
the
way
and
leo
pushed
quickly
past
him
secure
already
of
victory
but
as
full
of
dread
and
shame
as
if
he
had
been
defeated
he
found
her
stretched
on
a
lounge
her
face
buried
in
the
cushions
she
appeared
to
have
sunk
down
there
after
the
mental
excitement
of
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
a
of
silk
hung
about
her
limbs
in
folds
his
diamond
flashed
on
the
hand
which
she
held
out
to
him
without
changing
her
position
shut
the
door
she
whispered
he
obeyed
then
she
lifted
her
face
for
the
first
time
her
eyes
were
red
from
crying
how
had
she
been
able
to
manufacture
tears
for
this
farce
he
asked
himself
oh
i
was
so
ashamed
of
myself
she
murmured
ah
she
had
been
ashamed
that
would
account
for
it
and
he
began
to
console
her
he
told
her
this
horrible
hour
must
be
got
over
later
of
course
there
would
be
no
more
double
dealing
every
action
of
theirs
must
pass
before
ulrich
eyes
that
was
understood
before
she
exclaimed
offended
that
he
had
thought
it
necessary
to
remind
her
and
in
the
midst
of
her
distress
she
smiled
at
him
a
coy
happy
smile
now
he
thinks
that
we
she
began
her
sentence
did
not
end
but
there
was
something
in
her
broken
words
that
made
the
blood
mount
hotly
to
his
brow
that
bad
enough
he
growled
and
turned
his
back
there
was
a
silence
he
drew
out
his
watch
and
studied
the
hands
i
thank
you
leo
for
coming
she
began
again
shyly
after
a
little
while
did
you
expect
me
then
he
asked
oh
you
know
you
might
not
have
come
she
responded
with
a
sigh
such
a
woman
as
i
am
such
a
woman
as
you
are
what
do
you
mean
well
i
mean
that
it
would
be
surprising
if
people
did
keep
their
word
to
me
he
felt
a
bitter
resentment
against
this
sort
of
i
must
beg
you
lizzie
he
said
to
drop
this
false
humility
you
are
the
wife
of
ulrich
von
kletzingk
as
such
you
have
the
right
to
claim
respect
the
highest
respect
from
me
and
every
one
else
and
who
does
he
broke
off
and
raised
his
fists
so
that
she
withdrew
frightened
into
a
corner
of
the
lounge
pray
for
goodness
sake
do
get
so
angry
again
she
whispered
i
am
miserable
enough
that
is
to
be
all
over
now
he
said
what
my
misery
she
asked
with
a
disconsolate
smile
then
he
began
with
vehement
zeal
to
describe
to
her
what
he
proposed
the
future
should
be
he
had
a
double
mission
in
her
house
first
ulrich
happiness
secondly
her
rehabilitation
with
his
assistance
she
was
to
free
herself
from
the
oppressive
consciousness
of
the
old
guilt
she
was
to
learn
to
hold
up
her
head
again
and
to
get
used
to
a
sense
of
reconquered
dignity
so
that
it
was
not
to
be
conceived
for
a
moment
that
the
most
impertinent
dared
approach
her
with
anything
less
than
what
was
due
to
her
position
you
paint
heaven
to
me
she
murmured
and
a
tremulous
radiance
began
to
gleam
in
her
eyes
i
only
paint
what
it
is
possible
to
realise
he
answered
when
we
open
this
door
lizzie
all
the
old
rottenness
must
be
sloughed
off
we
shall
begin
a
new
life
from
that
moment
she
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
exhaled
over
him
a
cloud
of
the
perfume
she
habitually
used
the
discreet
delicacy
of
the
iris
was
overpowered
by
the
sharp
sweetness
of
the
opoponax
so
that
by
the
pungent
odour
of
the
atmosphere
around
her
he
made
for
the
window
his
glance
wandered
round
the
apartment
which
had
once
been
his
own
quarters
it
was
now
transformed
regardless
of
cost
into
the
luxurious
nest
of
a
fashionable
woman
of
the
world
the
walls
were
hung
with
blue
brocade
small
gilded
chairs
with
for
backs
tabourets
and
stools
of
every
description
were
dotted
about
crouching
on
the
indian
carpet
like
fabulous
beasts
a
gigantic
fan
of
marabou
feathers
served
as
a
screen
for
the
stove
bronzes
and
antique
figures
dainty
and
alluring
populated
the
cabinets
a
marqueterie
bookcase
contained
the
mistress
favourite
volumes
bound
in
vellum
and
an
old
venetian
was
draped
in
coquettish
folds
over
it
as
a
curtain
above
the
there
shone
in
carrara
marble
the
dreamy
head
of
the
vatican
eros
outlined
with
a
bluish
tinge
for
the
light
penetrated
to
it
through
a
blue
and
gold
embroidered
gauze
background
flooding
the
room
one
moment
with
a
subdued
duskiness
the
next
with
vivid
flashes
of
sunshine
the
whole
was
an
interior
commonly
enough
seen
in
european
capitals
but
something
quite
unheard
of
here
in
the
remote
hinterwald
he
spoils
you
far
too
much
he
said
with
a
kind
of
paternal
smile
shaking
his
finger
at
her
his
kindness
weighs
me
to
the
earth
she
replied
pressing
her
face
against
the
cushions
again
he
looked
at
his
watch
time
is
up
he
said
we
must
keep
him
waiting
for
nothing
she
lifted
her
hands
in
entreaty
five
minutes
more
she
begged
why
i
am
so
afraid
of
she
was
silent
do
be
a
coward
lizzie
he
exhorted
her
and
it
is
so
peaceful
here
so
harmonious
it
like
being
in
a
great
wide
forest
one
dares
at
last
breathe
freely
breathe
away
then
and
have
done
with
it
one
two
and
three
he
counted
with
the
handle
of
the
door
in
his
hand
then
he
tore
open
the
the
clear
hot
light
of
the
garden
salon
cut
into
the
blue
heavy
gloaming
for
god
sake
wait
she
cried
what
are
we
going
to
say
to
him
what
our
hearts
dictate
he
answered
holding
himself
erect
as
one
delivered
from
bondage
she
peeped
shyly
through
the
crack
of
the
door
but
at
the
same
moment
the
door
opposite
opened
behind
which
ulrich
had
been
waiting
the
result
of
their
interview
unhesitatingly
she
rushed
with
an
exclamation
of
affection
into
her
husband
arms
two
hours
later
the
three
sat
together
in
the
lamplight
at
the
happy
in
a
feeling
of
possessing
each
other
again
before
supper
leo
had
been
shown
round
the
stables
had
learned
much
and
wondered
more
but
now
agriculture
was
forgotten
and
friendship
enjoyed
its
own
ulrich
was
talkative
and
fluent
his
joy
buoyed
him
up
he
could
not
value
and
appreciate
the
wife
enough
who
that
day
had
laid
at
his
feet
an
almost
superhuman
testimony
of
her
love
every
caressing
look
he
cast
at
her
every
lapse
into
thought
was
a
secret
apology
for
having
ever
dared
to
think
himself
unhappy
at
her
side
she
for
her
part
treated
him
with
such
humble
gentleness
was
so
attentive
to
his
wishes
and
looked
up
to
him
so
full
of
admiration
that
leo
was
charmed
with
her
conduct
as
he
watched
her
and
could
scarcely
refrain
from
rubbing
his
hands
under
the
table
repeating
to
himself
over
and
over
again
this
is
my
doing
he
owes
his
happiness
to
towards
himself
too
lizzie
behaviour
was
perfect
she
was
reserved
without
being
stiff
she
conversed
in
an
easy
friendly
strain
without
letting
him
forget
that
worlds
lay
between
them
there
lingered
in
her
voice
a
tearful
tone
as
of
one
who
has
forgiven
a
bitter
wrong
without
having
had
time
to
forget
it
and
who
pleads
for
consideration
on
account
of
this
shortcoming
her
manner
seemed
as
perfectly
adapted
to
the
real
circumstances
as
to
the
feigned
so
leo
was
able
to
lose
the
painful
feeling
of
playing
the
hypocrite
in
his
satisfaction
he
blew
down
clouds
from
his
meerschaum
so
that
the
silver
supports
of
his
rattled
on
either
side
now
he
had
completely
won
him
again
for
the
first
time
who
sat
opposite
this
domestic
problem
lay
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
the
oil
in
the
two
branching
lamps
gurgled
and
boiled
from
the
depths
of
the
samovar
sounded
a
low
mysterious
humming
the
chirrup
of
the
grasshoppers
came
through
the
glass
doors
with
the
rustle
of
the
evening
breeze
in
the
orange
blossoms
it
was
a
rare
symphony
of
broken
veiled
tones
a
fitting
accompaniment
to
shrouding
the
past
and
to
meeting
the
future
with
its
longing
dreams
of
happiness
but
still
leo
discovered
something
that
did
not
please
him
in
ulrich
eyes
which
were
riveted
on
space
all
of
a
sudden
you
have
grown
mum
in
your
joy
old
man
said
he
i
rather
hear
you
harangue
us
ulrich
laughed
shrilly
and
rang
the
bell
wine
he
commanded
the
servant
virgin
milk
you
know
the
oldest
felicitas
who
was
bending
over
her
white
embroidery
glanced
roguishly
across
at
leo
who
knew
as
well
as
she
did
how
jealously
ulrich
guarded
this
priceless
treasure
of
his
cellar
then
she
stood
up
and
went
herself
to
superintend
the
order
the
friends
were
left
alone
ulrich
confessed
that
even
yet
he
could
hardly
believe
in
what
had
happened
the
reconciliation
which
once
he
would
have
thought
natural
and
easy
enough
seemed
now
it
had
been
accomplished
something
fabulous
and
incredible
yes
yes
you
are
just
like
children
who
have
kissed
and
made
friends
he
said
looking
at
leo
full
of
affectionate
admiration
how
did
you
do
it
you
have
only
to
appear
it
seems
and
behold
the
thorny
hedge
opens
and
the
heart
supposed
to
be
full
of
hate
flies
out
to
you
leo
laughed
nervously
and
said
something
about
its
not
having
been
so
bad
as
hating
felicitas
brought
in
the
wine
and
poured
the
fluid
into
the
tall
green
rummers
leo
felt
the
gaiety
which
always
awoke
in
him
at
the
sight
of
a
noble
drink
bubble
up
and
master
him
like
a
presage
of
ecstasy
it
rushed
over
him
sweeping
away
the
last
shred
of
all
that
had
hitherto
constrained
him
long
live
friendship
he
cried
raising
his
glass
and
may
nothing
separate
us
three
again
added
ulrich
thereupon
leo
eyes
met
lizzie
for
a
moment
in
a
rapid
consciously
guilty
glance
if
he
knew
the
glasses
clinked
a
pure
echoing
arpeggio
rang
from
the
superb
crystal
i
could
wish
that
our
lives
might
harmonise
in
such
musical
accord
as
that
said
ulrich
then
suddenly
he
broke
off
and
the
glass
sank
from
his
lips
he
cast
a
searching
look
along
the
wall
then
pulled
himself
together
and
emptied
the
glass
with
one
draught
leo
had
followed
his
eyes
there
on
the
wall
hung
the
child
portrait
felicitas
too
betrayed
uneasiness
and
after
a
moment
consideration
she
poured
a
few
drops
out
of
her
own
glass
into
that
of
her
husband
and
leaning
against
him
tenderly
whispered
in
his
ear
to
the
absent
one
whom
we
both
love
leo
pretended
to
have
noticed
nothing
then
to
clear
the
threatening
atmosphere
he
began
hastily
it
ca
be
helped
children
we
must
settle
a
thorny
matter
once
for
all
however
difficult
it
may
seem
to
discuss
it
just
now
husband
and
wife
listened
aghast
lizzie
cowered
and
gave
him
a
warning
look
as
much
as
to
say
for
god
sake
be
quiet
then
her
glance
glided
to
the
picture
it
seemed
as
if
she
feared
that
he
would
be
tactless
enough
to
begin
talking
of
the
boy
well
then
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
he
continued
how
are
we
to
break
to
our
beloved
neighbours
what
has
happened
and
what
all
its
consequences
will
be
for
i
do
mind
betting
that
they
are
only
waiting
in
their
christian
patience
for
a
chance
of
putting
a
scandalous
interpretation
on
it
felicitas
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
threw
him
a
grateful
glance
what
is
your
opinion
dearest
she
asked
leaning
her
chin
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
and
looking
up
at
her
husband
with
a
childlike
expression
he
ran
his
clenched
fingers
through
his
scanty
beard
do
ask
me
he
said
what
are
we
aristocrats
for
if
we
are
not
above
that
sort
of
thing
we
ought
to
exercise
our
own
personal
discretion
as
we
please
in
such
matters
and
not
trouble
ourselves
about
the
good
or
evil
tongues
of
a
mere
coffee
party
bravo
cried
leo
laughing
a
such
as
we
have
hung
out
there
more
than
once
could
not
express
himself
with
more
admirable
effect
on
the
gallows
stop
your
buffoonery
said
ulrich
why
do
we
pride
ourselves
on
being
made
of
superior
stuff
to
a
grocer
trembling
for
his
credit
in
our
own
domains
we
are
little
kings
owing
allegiance
to
our
feudal
lord
and
to
no
one
else
in
the
world
and
do
we
deem
our
country
squirarchies
something
higher
even
than
the
high
nobility
who
are
at
the
beck
and
call
of
the
court
and
bound
to
drag
french
and
russian
satellites
after
them
leo
nodded
beaming
with
pride
and
besides
that
are
not
our
lives
full
of
work
and
the
fulfilment
of
arduous
duties
continued
ulrich
so
i
should
think
we
might
be
allowed
to
be
the
best
judges
of
how
to
enjoy
our
leisure
what
can
the
opinion
of
the
world
matter
to
us
if
we
know
that
our
own
method
of
procedure
regardless
of
whether
men
abuse
it
or
not
is
actuated
by
pure
motives
ah
now
you
have
got
on
your
horse
mocked
leo
who
was
in
such
a
happy
frame
of
mind
that
he
felt
he
was
licensed
as
of
old
to
look
at
everything
from
the
ludicrous
side
it
is
incomprehensible
that
a
man
who
has
written
a
book
on
the
of
live
stock
can
pretend
that
he
is
in
a
position
to
grow
fat
on
the
motives
of
his
pure
heart
leaving
out
of
the
question
that
every
one
is
the
lucky
possessor
of
such
an
institution
he
added
hardly
audibly
but
every
one
may
snap
his
finger
at
public
opinion
ulrich
maintained
there
i
am
at
one
with
you
shouted
leo
showing
his
even
teeth
and
bringing
his
fist
down
on
the
table
and
while
felicitas
rose
and
appeared
to
have
something
to
do
in
the
dimly
lighted
he
bent
over
to
ulrich
and
said
in
a
low
voice
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
old
man
this
lecture
of
yours
is
quite
superfluous
my
shoulders
are
broad
enough
and
i
know
how
to
make
my
way
with
my
elbows
but
there
is
a
woman
in
the
business
my
wife
right
you
are
your
wife
we
must
be
considerate
for
her
women
have
their
own
codes
of
honour
we
must
tolerate
her
being
placed
in
an
anomalous
position
ulrich
was
silent
he
was
always
open
to
conviction
and
he
did
not
hesitate
for
an
instant
to
recognise
the
full
importance
of
suggestion
felicitas
came
back
lovely
and
deprecating
as
if
the
conversation
had
been
on
some
theme
of
farming
or
agriculture
which
women
are
not
supposed
to
understand
but
as
the
two
men
continued
to
stare
before
them
in
a
brown
study
she
put
in
her
word
with
a
pretty
hesitation
and
helplessness
like
one
who
is
certain
that
she
is
going
to
say
something
stupid
if
you
do
mind
she
said
i
think
that
we
ought
to
make
the
world
take
the
responsibility
for
what
neither
of
them
understood
her
for
your
coming
together
how
can
we
asked
leo
i
do
know
yet
but
i
think
it
over
and
when
i
have
hit
on
something
i
let
you
know
dear
leo
at
once
she
spoke
with
such
a
comic
important
little
air
that
ulrich
broke
into
relieved
laughter
and
said
with
jocose
pity
poor
child
she
going
to
think
it
over
she
pouted
and
while
he
caressed
her
small
curly
head
awkwardly
she
closed
her
eyes
and
threw
herself
back
against
his
arm
he
gazed
down
on
his
wife
for
a
moment
shyly
and
passionately
then
rose
quickly
and
went
into
the
next
room
in
case
his
happiness
should
unman
him
soon
after
the
rich
low
notes
of
an
organ
sounded
on
leo
ear
in
astonishment
he
listened
attentively
to
the
sweet
full
volume
of
melody
there
used
to
be
only
an
old
quavering
harmonium
in
the
on
which
ulrich
had
been
wont
to
practise
his
chorales
what
does
this
mean
he
asked
felicitas
who
was
putting
away
her
crewels
she
laid
her
finger
on
her
mouth
it
is
a
new
sort
of
organ
that
he
has
got
from
america
she
whispered
across
the
table
stay
here
and
do
disturb
him
i
must
go
and
see
if
he
wants
to
use
the
when
he
does
he
likes
me
to
blow
for
him
she
went
out
noiselessly
leaving
the
wide
open
behind
her
a
few
moments
later
candles
illumined
the
darkness
whence
the
mysterious
flood
of
sound
proceeded
ulrich
lost
in
the
music
was
seated
before
a
curious
instrument
resembling
a
cottage
piano
except
that
it
was
built
upwards
in
several
stages
like
a
staircase
his
head
was
thrown
back
and
he
was
staring
at
the
ceiling
felicitas
in
her
diaphanous
dress
floating
about
the
room
like
a
cloud
laid
softly
a
score
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
he
nodded
his
thanks
without
taking
his
hands
from
the
keys
then
transposing
the
key
he
began
to
play
the
piece
she
had
chosen
leo
knew
it
well
it
was
a
mass
by
scarlatti
which
in
old
days
ulrich
had
loved
better
than
anything
he
himself
had
never
been
tired
of
girding
at
the
antiquated
fugues
which
he
had
called
pictures
of
the
saints
set
to
music
but
now
when
he
heard
again
after
years
of
wild
wanderings
the
old
familiar
homely
notes
his
heart
was
stirred
to
warm
emotion
fighting
down
his
tears
he
threw
himself
into
an
armchair
which
stood
in
a
dark
corner
nearest
the
door
enveloped
himself
in
clouds
of
tobacco
and
meditated
dissolving
thoughts
half
formed
passing
through
his
mind
it
was
all
over
now
of
course
with
the
plans
he
had
made
at
his
johanna
might
triumph
and
the
old
chaplain
with
her
but
what
did
that
matter
after
all
ulrich
happiness
was
the
main
thing
and
is
he
happy
he
asked
the
question
with
a
momentary
horrid
doubt
of
himself
of
her
and
everything
good
then
he
bent
forward
and
looked
through
the
door
he
devoured
with
his
eyes
the
picture
if
that
was
not
happiness
no
one
was
happy
on
this
earth
she
stood
by
ulrich
in
all
her
loveliness
encircling
his
long
lean
neck
tenderly
with
her
arm
following
the
music
with
vigilant
eagerness
so
that
she
might
be
ready
to
help
at
the
right
moment
the
vox
humana
ulrich
begged
glancing
up
at
her
she
seized
one
of
the
stops
which
sprang
out
with
a
slight
click
and
as
leo
listened
there
rose
the
trembling
plaintive
sound
of
a
human
voice
struggling
with
fervent
imploring
notes
towards
heaven
was
it
not
human
what
i
did
the
voice
seemed
to
be
asking
was
not
the
sin
sweet
for
which
i
am
now
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
then
there
came
into
his
head
the
old
maxim
repent
nothing
roared
from
the
depths
of
his
being
he
pulled
himself
together
defiantly
no
in
truth
he
repented
nothing
he
was
not
penitent
now
there
would
be
no
more
secrecy
ulrich
was
happy
lizzie
freed
of
her
old
fears
was
turning
to
her
husband
the
past
was
as
if
it
had
never
leo
are
you
satisfied
with
me
murmured
a
melancholy
wistful
voice
at
this
moment
in
his
ear
and
a
strong
perfume
enveloped
him
he
started
he
was
almost
choked
by
anger
and
was
obliged
to
put
the
utmost
restraint
on
himself
not
to
hurl
some
coarse
epithet
at
the
head
of
her
who
bent
over
him
with
a
resigned
smile
as
if
she
were
a
lamb
going
to
the
slaughter
if
you
want
to
be
praised
go
to
your
husband
he
said
roughly
and
then
he
stood
up
to
take
his
leave
xvii
a
few
days
after
leo
first
visit
to
uhlenfelde
which
had
been
kept
a
secret
frau
von
stolt
of
stoltenhof
had
invited
some
of
her
particularly
intimate
friends
and
acquaintances
to
an
afternoon
coffee
the
kletzingks
had
accepted
and
as
it
happened
that
both
the
young
cuirassier
officers
had
come
home
on
eight
days
leave
after
the
autumn
man
oe
uvres
several
county
families
with
daughters
and
nieces
had
been
added
to
the
party
at
the
last
minute
this
was
done
at
the
request
of
the
master
of
the
house
the
wily
old
fox
having
been
for
more
than
a
year
on
the
trail
of
felicitas
wished
thus
conveniently
to
rid
himself
of
the
rivalry
of
his
sons
the
ladies
had
seated
themselves
in
the
small
salon
with
the
paper
on
which
a
collection
of
racehorses
framed
in
polished
light
oak
formed
a
kind
of
dado
the
large
the
pride
of
the
house
with
its
wooden
galleries
and
mighty
chandeliers
of
stag
antlers
was
reserved
for
the
gentlemen
felicitas
von
kletzingk
attired
in
a
black
silk
dress
which
transformed
her
usually
charms
into
a
sedate
matronliness
sat
on
the
right
of
the
worthy
frau
von
sembritzky
reclining
in
the
depths
of
the
capacious
sofa
of
honour
covered
with
green
plush
which
formerly
she
had
flown
from
as
if
it
had
been
a
veritable
trap
now
she
was
following
with
sincere
sympathy
the
complaints
which
the
ladies
all
heads
of
large
households
were
pouring
out
to
each
other
her
mass
of
fair
curly
hair
that
she
was
wont
to
frizz
out
in
the
wildest
fashion
was
smoothly
brushed
back
from
her
brow
and
a
modest
gold
chain
surrounded
the
high
plain
collar
of
her
dress
the
conversation
suitably
to
the
season
turned
on
preserving
frau
von
neuhaus
of
zubowen
a
rotund
sexagenarian
with
a
greenish
over
her
tousled
hair
had
tried
the
new
steam
apparatus
and
had
found
it
in
spite
of
its
apparent
advantages
thoroughly
unpractical
the
baroness
von
krassow
opposed
this
view
in
an
exaggerated
fatigued
voice
and
old
frau
von
sembritzky
who
since
the
marriage
of
her
son
with
little
meta
podewyl
was
doing
her
very
best
to
revive
the
tradition
with
regard
to
wicked
glared
about
her
wrathfully
like
a
teased
vulture
through
the
bars
of
its
cage
as
if
she
suspected
that
some
one
cherished
the
design
of
ousting
her
from
the
seat
of
honour
meta
sat
next
her
the
poor
young
thing
pressed
the
old
termagant
hand
in
hers
in
nervous
awe
while
with
a
longing
smile
that
threatened
every
minute
to
become
tearful
she
glanced
across
at
the
table
for
young
girls
from
which
she
was
banished
for
ever
the
hostess
herself
had
taken
a
place
to
the
left
of
felicitas
bolt
upright
and
stiff
as
a
grenadier
she
sat
there
and
though
smiling
down
amiably
on
her
neighbour
she
kept
watch
that
no
stolen
glances
were
exchanged
between
her
and
the
gentlemen
in
the
next
room
but
even
frau
von
stolt
had
not
the
smallest
fault
to
find
with
the
young
woman
she
appeared
charmed
with
the
conversation
and
like
a
pupil
thirsting
for
knowledge
she
put
in
shy
little
questions
in
the
pauses
only
now
and
then
did
she
cast
a
wandering
look
along
the
collection
of
famous
racehorses
no
one
noticed
how
her
arms
stiffened
as
if
with
cramp
and
her
fingers
clasped
and
unclasped
convulsively
she
had
dared
much
and
the
next
few
minutes
would
be
pregnant
with
events
the
ladies
from
halewitz
as
an
understood
thing
had
not
been
invited
for
the
last
two
years
every
hostess
in
the
neighbourhood
had
known
that
a
meeting
between
felicitas
and
any
member
of
the
sellenthin
family
was
something
to
be
avoided
otherwise
the
table
consecrated
to
the
young
would
have
been
less
quiet
and
enlivened
by
hertha
sharp
repartees
amidst
the
young
men
too
there
prevailed
a
subdued
almost
depressed
tone
the
admirers
of
felicitas
hung
about
the
doorposts
and
ogled
her
through
the
folds
of
the
in
vain
for
none
had
she
the
old
intense
look
and
soft
understanding
smile
and
as
none
of
them
could
summon
up
the
courage
to
penetrate
to
the
corner
sacred
to
chaperons
much
that
pressed
for
a
solution
had
to
remain
unexplained
they
wanted
to
know
why
for
six
weeks
they
had
been
ignored
as
if
they
did
exist
by
the
fair
chatelaine
of
uhlenfelde
they
put
their
heads
together
and
exchanged
observations
with
the
naïve
unchaste
laugh
in
which
immature
men
of
the
world
are
accustomed
to
find
vent
for
the
illegal
desires
of
their
hearts
besides
the
sons
of
the
house
there
were
in
the
forefront
hans
von
krassow
and
frank
von
otzen
the
two
swells
of
the
neighbourhood
the
first
a
brown
and
brawny
youth
of
with
a
long
jockey
neck
and
retreating
forehead
had
been
for
half
a
term
a
bonn
undergraduate
but
on
receipt
of
the
first
bundle
of
bills
his
father
had
sent
for
him
home
again
since
then
he
had
comported
himself
as
a
kind
of
uncrowned
king
who
for
the
rest
of
his
days
expects
the
whole
world
to
be
at
his
feet
and
in
the
eyes
of
others
too
the
reflected
glory
of
those
kneips
with
the
prussians
at
bonn
cast
a
nimbus
round
him
for
the
rest
he
was
good
company
sportive
and
full
of
lively
tricks
and
whimsicalities
the
heart
delight
of
all
the
barmaids
for
six
miles
round
the
other
frank
von
otzen
liked
to
be
taken
more
seriously
his
high
ambition
had
been
to
go
on
a
foreign
embassy
but
he
had
been
ploughed
in
his
exam
for
the
diplomatic
service
and
since
was
obliged
to
be
content
with
helping
his
father
to
exploit
the
local
but
he
retained
the
cryptic
monosyllabic
phraseology
of
diplomacy
used
french
soap
and
went
to
english
tailors
he
was
laughed
at
for
his
wide
trousers
but
nevertheless
envied
for
his
air
of
intimacy
with
the
world
of
fashion
then
there
was
the
young
heir
of
neuhaus
an
extremely
fair
plump
stripling
whose
clothes
according
to
hinterwald
modes
were
too
narrow
and
too
tight
he
had
a
pair
of
big
blue
eyes
in
his
smooth
handsome
face
and
was
so
stupid
that
he
was
thought
to
suffer
from
melancholia
so
that
felicitas
had
chosen
him
for
the
confidant
of
her
elegiac
moods
benno
von
zesslingen
who
had
once
drunk
three
gallons
unassisted
and
hans
von
kleist
of
whom
there
was
literally
nothing
whatever
to
record
made
up
the
party
these
young
gentlemen
were
the
cream
of
felicitas
train
of
admirers
lizzie
untamed
team
as
she
herself
dubbed
them
after
they
had
lounged
about
the
door
for
some
time
still
longingly
expectant
that
their
lovely
friend
would
come
to
their
rescue
lothair
stolt
said
it
was
no
use
waiting
any
longer
and
contemptuously
ignoring
the
young
girls
asked
the
others
to
go
with
him
into
the
garden
and
start
a
with
papa
new
pistols
old
stolt
who
as
host
had
been
daring
enough
to
approach
the
dangerous
corner
now
and
again
with
a
joke
also
abandoned
the
siege
and
remembered
that
ulrich
von
kletzingk
had
asked
his
advice
as
friend
and
neighbour
about
a
valuable
that
was
showing
signs
of
going
blind
after
castration
he
hastily
tasted
the
bowl
of
that
already
stood
on
the
ice
and
then
set
out
for
the
stables
where
ulrich
with
several
of
the
elder
gentlemen
was
waiting
for
him
thus
the
hall
completely
emptied
itself
then
suddenly
there
came
a
thunderclap
in
the
midst
of
the
pompous
now
languishing
conversation
of
the
ladies
on
the
sofa
a
servant
had
entered
the
salon
and
was
announcing
in
a
loud
unmistakable
voice
herr
von
sellenthin
wishes
to
know
if
the
gnädige
frau
can
receive
him
the
last
murmur
died
away
every
eye
turned
to
felicitas
who
as
if
turned
to
stone
from
terror
stared
her
hostess
in
the
face
the
latter
had
quite
lost
her
presence
of
mind
how
could
she
let
him
come
in
with
the
full
of
visitors
equipages
and
the
full
of
their
coats
and
hats
it
would
be
an
insult
pressing
the
hand
of
the
trembling
felicitas
soothingly
she
declared
that
she
must
go
out
to
him
and
explain
but
before
she
could
carry
out
this
intention
the
door
was
opened
wide
and
leo
massive
figure
entered
with
elastic
step
and
much
it
was
true
that
his
sunburnt
face
had
lost
a
little
of
its
colour
true
that
his
eye
searched
the
salon
quickly
and
nervously
yet
no
one
suspected
what
a
struggle
it
had
cost
him
to
find
the
way
here
and
what
a
drama
was
to
be
enacted
i
always
was
a
lucky
dog
he
exclaimed
as
he
stooped
to
kiss
frau
von
stolt
large
red
hand
she
was
still
dumb
but
had
advanced
a
few
steps
to
meet
him
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
i
should
have
to
beg
each
of
these
ladies
pardon
separately
for
having
been
so
remiss
about
calling
since
my
return
but
now
i
can
make
one
solemn
ceremony
do
for
all
this
was
rattled
off
fluently
as
if
it
had
been
learnt
by
heart
frau
von
stolt
whose
broad
shoulders
entirely
hid
felicitas
muttered
a
subdued
welcome
and
shook
his
hand
as
if
she
never
meant
to
let
it
go
but
it
was
no
good
laughing
he
passed
on
and
stretched
out
his
hand
saying
that
they
were
all
equally
good
friends
and
neighbours
to
the
first
who
sat
next
on
the
sofa
to
the
hostess
a
long
terrified
silence
ensued
his
right
hand
remained
suspended
in
then
name
rang
haltingly
from
his
lips
felicitas
deadly
pale
slowly
lifted
her
big
blue
eyes
and
gave
the
clumsy
hostess
a
look
of
pitiful
reproach
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
responsibility
for
the
monstrous
thing
that
was
going
to
happen
if
it
caused
a
scandal
in
the
house
would
be
on
her
own
shoulders
and
then
she
laid
two
trembling
fingers
in
the
waiting
hand
a
deep
breath
passed
through
the
salon
leo
had
bent
down
to
impress
a
light
kiss
of
gratitude
on
the
hand
which
had
been
extended
to
him
in
forgiveness
and
now
he
turned
hurriedly
away
from
her
to
frau
von
sembritzky
whom
he
greeted
with
the
noisiest
effusion
thus
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
remark
that
felicitas
who
was
half
fainting
was
led
from
the
room
by
frau
von
stolt
the
ladies
delighted
from
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
that
the
painful
situation
had
been
so
well
got
over
also
seemed
as
if
they
saw
and
heard
nothing
while
leo
broke
into
exclamations
of
amazement
at
the
sight
of
little
meta
podewyl
had
he
not
carried
her
pickaback
promoted
to
the
dignity
of
a
married
woman
the
gentle
little
person
who
in
her
lilac
silk
gown
was
enthroned
so
prettily
among
the
older
ladies
smiled
feeling
shy
and
flattered
together
with
the
others
sitting
at
the
young
girls
table
she
had
gushed
and
dreamed
about
the
fugitive
it
was
said
that
it
was
she
who
had
composed
the
verses
of
the
chorale
which
every
sunday
during
the
confirmation
time
had
been
passed
round
amongst
them
and
in
which
foreign
lands
rhymed
with
sacred
bands
and
home
love
with
pure
dove
but
then
hans
von
sembritzky
had
shown
he
was
in
earnest
and
she
had
suddenly
forgot
her
prayers
for
the
absent
hero
frau
von
neuhaus
who
had
designs
on
elly
for
her
son
and
so
considered
herself
almost
as
one
of
the
family
caught
leo
by
the
arm
and
led
him
over
to
the
young
people
table
where
some
who
had
proved
less
faithless
were
gathered
the
young
creatures
six
of
them
altogether
stood
up
and
ranged
themselves
in
a
they
were
all
blushing
and
all
cast
their
eyes
on
their
plates
there
was
not
one
in
this
bevy
of
girls
who
had
not
languished
for
him
since
she
was
twelve
years
old
who
had
not
felt
a
romantic
thrill
at
the
story
of
the
fatal
duel
and
the
flight
from
his
fatherland
of
the
murderer
there
were
two
younger
sisters
podewyl
then
trude
krassow
susi
neuhaus
and
two
bourgeois
maidens
with
whom
they
were
compassionately
intimate
leo
eye
rested
with
pleasure
on
the
and
heads
of
the
little
crew
who
stood
with
beating
hearts
smiling
at
him
he
was
elated
that
the
game
he
played
was
turning
out
so
well
an
ecstasy
of
success
rushed
over
him
giving
his
spirits
wings
and
doubling
his
capabilities
of
enjoyment
he
squeezed
each
of
the
soft
rosy
hands
and
gazed
with
the
rapture
of
a
privileged
flame
into
each
pair
of
shining
eyes
he
had
quite
forgotten
felicitas
and
then
he
took
his
leave
of
them
in
order
to
join
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
as
he
followed
the
servant
across
the
gravel
path
of
the
garden
and
drew
near
the
group
of
young
cavaliers
he
became
aware
that
amidst
loud
laughter
they
were
shooting
at
small
yellowish
quoits
which
at
every
shot
flew
into
the
air
and
mostly
fell
to
pieces
before
the
bullet
had
even
touched
them
these
quoits
were
thin
slices
of
gruyere
cheese
somewhat
crumbly
from
the
dry
air
which
with
other
good
things
had
been
supplied
for
the
young
gentlemen
light
refreshment
but
as
the
appetite
necessary
for
their
enjoyment
was
lacking
they
had
been
turned
to
another
purpose
bets
were
concluded
books
made
forfeits
paid
false
starts
announced
just
as
if
they
were
on
the
racecourse
leo
stepped
into
the
circle
which
respectfully
opened
to
admit
him
he
belonged
to
an
older
generation
than
these
the
oldest
of
whom
had
not
passed
the
first
third
of
his
twenties
in
consequence
he
did
not
know
any
of
them
and
had
indeed
scarcely
set
eyes
on
them
since
they
had
left
school
after
they
had
greeted
him
with
astonished
respect
a
laughing
babel
of
voices
began
to
explain
to
him
the
newly
invented
sport
he
took
them
in
one
by
one
when
they
were
not
looking
so
it
was
in
the
society
of
these
that
she
had
sought
and
found
enjoyment
how
infamous
and
what
was
more
how
ridiculous
lothair
stolt
as
son
of
the
house
invited
him
to
take
part
in
the
game
he
himself
offered
to
give
up
one
of
the
favourites
which
had
already
been
heavily
backed
because
it
was
certain
not
to
fall
to
pieces
before
it
was
shot
at
leo
expressed
his
thanks
and
said
that
he
was
a
novice
in
this
art
but
you
can
shoot
asked
the
young
master
of
zesslingen
a
little
dear
benno
they
scouted
his
modesty
every
one
knew
that
he
used
to
be
the
first
shot
in
the
country
and
who
could
say
what
fresh
skill
he
might
have
acquired
on
the
other
side
of
the
ocean
we
wo
hear
any
excuse
some
one
cried
from
the
little
crowd
leo
felt
in
the
humour
for
the
prank
it
was
an
opportunity
too
of
reading
a
timely
lesson
to
some
who
might
later
perhaps
be
disposed
to
make
themselves
objectionable
the
revolver
was
our
speciality
over
there
he
said
looking
round
we
have
one
we
have
one
they
shouted
in
chorus
lothair
handed
him
a
magnificent
pistol
with
long
blue
gleaming
barrels
but
he
must
shoot
at
the
cheese
called
out
herr
von
zesslingen
who
since
he
had
drunk
the
three
gallons
was
looked
upon
as
an
authority
amongst
them
just
as
you
please
replied
leo
the
favourite
a
fine
slice
of
porous
cheese
about
the
size
of
a
plate
with
firm
rind
was
solemnly
handed
to
him
he
carried
it
between
two
fingers
to
the
mark
which
was
about
fifteen
paces
from
the
and
placed
it
on
two
of
the
pegs
by
which
the
circular
target
was
fastened
to
the
table
it
must
fall
directly
it
is
hit
he
said
the
youths
exchanged
glances
one
did
need
to
go
to
south
america
to
learn
to
hit
an
object
the
size
of
a
man
hand
at
a
distance
of
fifteen
paces
the
first
shot
was
fired
the
slice
did
not
stir
and
surprise
increased
at
intervals
of
several
seconds
two
other
shots
followed
the
slice
stood
fast
as
if
it
had
taken
root
on
the
mark
will
the
gentlemen
satisfy
themselves
that
the
target
has
not
been
struck
said
leo
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
it
has
replied
lothair
feeling
that
he
might
now
safely
venture
on
a
little
impertinence
all
the
same
i
invite
inspection
shaking
their
heads
the
little
group
trotted
over
to
the
target
it
seemed
almost
as
if
he
had
been
pulling
their
legs
but
not
a
trace
of
the
last
shots
was
to
be
found
on
the
broad
surface
of
the
the
bullets
must
have
stuck
in
the
air
only
when
leo
knocked
over
the
slice
of
cheese
with
the
nail
of
his
little
finger
was
the
mystery
solved
the
slice
had
three
pores
larger
than
the
rest
a
bullet
had
penetrated
through
each
of
these
almost
without
grazing
the
side
they
gave
vent
to
an
exclamation
of
awed
amazement
for
here
was
a
man
capable
of
choosing
the
very
pore
in
his
enemy
skin
that
he
might
fancy
in
which
to
lodge
a
bullet
soon
afterwards
the
older
gentlemen
came
over
from
the
ulrich
amongst
them
when
he
beheld
his
friend
laughing
and
joking
with
the
youngsters
he
stiffened
and
withdrew
a
few
steps
looking
almost
shocked
before
he
could
open
his
mouth
leo
was
at
his
side
silence
he
exhorted
then
he
shook
heartily
the
hands
stretched
out
to
him
on
all
sides
so
soon
as
it
was
over
he
led
ulrich
aside
we
must
keep
up
the
deception
he
said
to
him
and
seem
as
if
we
had
not
met
since
the
day
at
the
station
why
these
resources
he
asked
mystified
because
felicitas
is
cleverer
than
we
two
put
together
he
answered
with
cynical
exuberance
she
planned
this
yes
of
course
and
wrote
to
you
equally
of
course
and
then
leo
saw
that
he
could
not
rise
to
the
task
of
convincing
his
friend
let
her
explain
to
you
herself
he
said
getting
red
and
turning
away
on
the
way
home
ulrich
learnt
what
he
wanted
to
know
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
like
a
child
who
fears
a
scolding
and
hopes
to
turn
it
off
by
being
funny
felicitas
told
him
of
the
stroke
of
genius
which
had
resulted
in
frau
von
stolt
interceding
to
bring
about
the
reconciliation
for
her
own
and
her
guests
sake
which
otherwise
she
would
never
have
countenanced
or
forgiven
a
dispensation
of
providence
had
drawn
the
good
woman
into
the
fray
to
convince
her
even
while
she
resisted
of
the
holiness
of
such
a
work
of
love
ulrich
listened
still
vexed
why
did
you
not
tell
me
what
you
intended
to
do
he
asked
because
i
would
have
my
dear
good
noble
husband
mixed
up
in
it
she
replied
he
shook
his
head
he
could
not
understand
even
yet
how
the
two
could
have
lent
themselves
to
such
scheming
it
was
all
done
for
your
sake
she
whispered
leaning
against
him
tenderly
that
night
ulrich
spent
many
hours
walking
up
and
down
his
room
they
lie
for
me
they
deceive
for
me
for
me
they
reverse
all
the
laws
of
the
human
heart
can
such
love
as
that
lead
to
any
good
and
when
he
had
put
out
the
light
and
stared
into
the
darkness
with
searching
eyes
the
thought
flashed
suddenly
across
him
this
reconciliation
ought
not
to
be
it
is
not
moral
xviii
it
was
too
late
now
to
turn
back
and
however
much
ulrich
kletzingk
might
feel
himself
master
of
his
will
he
recognised
the
fact
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
bear
turning
back
he
clung
to
the
repossession
of
leo
with
the
whole
strength
of
his
passionate
heart
which
could
never
do
enough
to
show
its
love
the
greater
the
sacrifice
which
had
been
made
for
him
the
more
jealously
he
prized
the
value
of
what
had
been
regained
for
the
most
part
things
went
on
in
their
old
routine
leo
was
seldom
able
to
come
over
and
then
for
only
a
few
hours
at
a
time
for
at
halewitz
the
oats
were
not
yet
disposed
of
when
he
did
come
he
was
in
gay
spirits
but
in
his
solicitude
for
ulrich
there
mingled
a
nervousness
that
was
altogether
alien
to
his
nature
the
first
time
that
he
had
made
his
way
over
and
looked
his
friend
in
the
eyes
his
rose
to
his
throat
for
he
felt
as
if
some
misfortune
had
happened
and
as
if
either
anger
or
pain
blazed
at
him
from
ulrich
face
then
he
seized
the
thin
transparent
hands
which
the
summer
sun
had
powdered
with
a
heap
of
freckles
and
as
he
pressed
them
felt
thankful
that
his
alarm
had
been
uncalled
for
but
still
it
could
not
be
disguised
that
something
in
their
friendship
had
been
severed
something
which
could
not
be
cemented
or
grow
together
again
their
mutual
love
had
not
lessened
their
confidence
in
each
other
was
the
same
but
a
shadow
crouched
between
them
and
rose
its
full
height
when
neither
was
on
his
guard
ulrich
too
was
conscious
of
this
the
more
fervidly
he
clung
to
the
refound
friend
the
clearer
he
saw
that
the
manner
of
their
intercourse
had
altered
hardly
perceptible
of
course
no
third
person
would
have
noticed
it
but
it
could
not
escape
ulrich
whose
sensitive
organism
longed
for
the
sunshine
of
harmless
gaiety
leo
jokes
were
rarer
he
weighed
his
words
and
sometimes
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
as
if
considering
whether
what
he
was
going
to
say
would
hurt
his
friend
feelings
do
treat
me
as
if
i
were
a
brittle
article
he
besought
him
once
you
know
i
can
stand
a
puff
of
wind
and
you
used
not
to
spoil
me
perhaps
not
replied
leo
wrinkling
his
forehead
the
devil
knows
how
it
is
that
i
have
suddenly
got
into
this
mincing
way
after
the
manner
of
sturdy
country
squires
leo
in
old
days
had
delighted
to
crack
broad
jests
which
though
in
themselves
distasteful
to
ulrich
he
had
let
pass
with
a
smile
feeling
that
no
side
of
human
nature
ought
to
be
ignored
it
occurred
to
him
now
that
leo
avoided
all
reference
to
sexual
subjects
and
had
ceased
to
retail
gallant
adventures
have
you
secretly
gone
over
to
the
monks
ulrich
asked
once
why
because
women
do
seem
to
exist
for
you
now
a
time
comes
when
one
gets
sick
of
that
sort
of
thing
leo
answered
and
quickly
turned
the
conversation
into
another
channel
a
vague
feeling
of
shyness
kept
him
at
a
distance
from
the
castle
he
much
preferred
to
get
his
friend
out
into
the
fields
and
plantations
where
they
would
ride
silently
side
by
side
but
while
they
were
trying
out
of
doors
to
enjoy
once
more
the
old
communion
of
interests
which
had
so
long
been
sacrificed
felicitas
hidden
behind
the
curtains
of
one
of
the
balcony
windows
cast
wistful
eyes
after
them
she
had
no
just
cause
for
complaining
of
leo
he
scarcely
ever
omitted
at
the
end
of
his
visits
to
seek
a
short
interview
with
her
and
when
time
would
not
allow
of
this
courtesy
she
received
through
ulrich
his
greetings
and
apologies
his
manner
towards
her
was
uniformly
natural
and
kind
there
was
something
in
it
of
brotherly
camaraderie
half
respectful
half
facetious
and
the
pressure
of
his
hand
and
the
expression
in
his
eyes
betokened
sincere
and
warm
friendship
in
short
she
ought
to
have
been
content
nevertheless
it
dispirited
and
hurt
her
that
no
look
or
syllable
of
his
ever
recalled
what
she
had
once
been
to
him
it
would
seem
as
if
not
the
slightest
trace
had
been
left
in
his
memory
of
that
mad
blissful
time
vivid
pictures
of
which
lived
on
in
hers
for
despite
all
pain
she
could
not
banish
them
what
she
had
done
for
him
was
in
vain
if
he
had
thus
erased
everything
from
his
mind
and
made
it
blank
to
the
past
she
cried
a
good
deal
in
these
days
declared
that
her
life
had
been
a
failure
and
revelled
in
old
memories
which
whether
painful
or
sweet
filled
her
soul
with
bitterness
she
looked
back
and
saw
herself
from
earliest
childhood
a
burden
to
unknown
relations
parentless
and
homeless
an
adventuress
through
circumstance
on
the
for
lucky
chances
she
had
never
known
her
mother
her
father
an
impecunious
officer
had
been
embittered
by
an
unsuccessful
career
and
out
of
disappointment
at
his
discharge
had
taken
his
own
life
from
his
she
had
been
taken
by
an
aunt
to
her
institution
where
for
three
years
she
had
gazed
with
yearning
through
a
barred
window
on
the
forbidden
street
then
other
relations
sent
her
to
a
fashionable
belgian
school
where
the
pious
sisters
instructed
her
in
the
art
of
dancing
and
embroidery
and
inculcated
coquetry
and
next
by
one
of
those
turns
of
fate
which
characterised
the
years
of
her
early
girlhood
she
found
herself
transported
to
the
solitude
of
a
polish
magnate
estate
from
there
after
various
stages
of
transition
and
misery
she
passed
into
the
circle
of
halewitz
which
in
spite
of
several
efforts
to
get
away
from
it
for
she
dearly
loved
change
she
was
destined
to
take
root
in
after
all
it
was
the
only
place
where
she
was
not
forcibly
reminded
of
her
helplessness
and
homelessness
and
what
was
more
where
her
bewitching
personality
was
allowed
to
unfold
itself
according
to
her
sovereign
will
at
that
time
there
had
been
a
little
flirtation
between
her
and
leo
the
innocent
prelude
to
their
later
guilty
liaison
it
had
passed
without
leaving
any
serious
consequences
behind
the
first
to
approach
her
in
earnest
with
a
proposal
was
herr
von
rhaden
the
proprietor
of
fichtkampen
a
former
and
at
one
time
a
crony
of
old
baron
sellenthin
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
forties
sallow
grizzled
and
gallant
felicitas
admired
as
she
knew
herself
to
be
said
yes
without
much
reflection
for
since
her
thirteenth
year
she
had
determined
to
take
the
first
husband
she
could
get
to
throw
herself
into
his
arms
whether
he
was
the
best
or
worst
of
men
so
that
she
might
be
released
from
her
forlorn
situation
by
an
early
marriage
thus
at
nineteen
she
migrated
to
fichtkampen
became
mother
of
a
son
danced
rode
made
point
lace
played
patience
and
waited
for
the
advent
of
the
hero
whom
the
cards
promised
her
she
would
gladly
have
flirted
only
the
cantankerous
disposition
of
her
elderly
husband
would
not
have
permitted
it
first
de
and
then
really
to
satisfy
her
heart
hunger
she
attracted
leo
to
her
again
as
a
friend
of
her
youth
and
a
second
cousin
he
was
placed
beyond
her
jealous
suspicion
and
so
things
happened
as
they
were
bound
to
happen
the
famous
duel
which
made
her
a
widow
was
the
climax
it
would
have
been
sheer
insanity
to
remain
a
widow
and
no
one
blamed
her
when
after
nearly
two
years
mourning
she
accepted
the
hand
of
the
grave
and
uhich
von
kletzingk
although
he
was
the
of
the
man
who
had
killed
her
first
husband
now
for
the
first
time
she
was
free
and
enjoyed
the
liberty
she
had
so
long
yearned
for
ulrich
patience
was
admirable
he
guessed
that
a
secret
repugnance
alienated
her
from
him
the
sickly
man
as
his
innate
refinement
of
feeling
would
not
allow
him
to
take
by
force
what
was
not
readily
acceded
he
put
a
bridle
on
his
own
wishes
his
did
not
make
him
reproach
her
she
found
in
her
husband
her
ready
and
sincerest
friend
while
she
engaged
in
flirtations
with
the
gentlemen
of
the
country
round
scoring
triumphs
which
fed
her
vanity
but
happy
she
was
not
it
was
part
of
her
nature
to
luxuriate
in
feeling
unhappy
it
raised
her
in
her
own
esteem
to
a
higher
sphere
and
increased
the
charms
of
her
personality
she
posed
to
the
world
defenceless
and
lovely
with
a
veil
of
melancholy
draping
transparently
the
mystery
of
a
soul
devoured
by
a
secret
desire
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
with
leo
return
a
new
epoch
in
her
life
had
opened
folly
was
at
an
end
her
existence
had
become
serious
once
more
it
seemed
to
her
clear
that
she
did
perhaps
never
had
loved
him
and
daily
and
hourly
she
repeated
this
assertion
to
herself
as
his
image
rose
before
her
again
laughing
as
of
old
and
would
not
be
obliterated
from
her
mind
any
more
he
roused
her
animosity
at
times
she
almost
hated
him
yet
a
gnawing
anxious
curiosity
drew
her
to
him
irresistibly
during
the
first
eight
days
of
his
return
she
had
given
her
train
of
admirers
their
then
she
went
further
and
sacrificed
her
child
she
had
found
a
thousand
ways
of
deceiving
herself
into
justification
of
the
act
she
scarcely
knew
and
she
did
want
to
know
what
she
was
doing
even
the
goal
that
she
thought
to
attain
by
it
was
misty
and
vague
now
the
child
had
been
gone
nearly
a
second
month
and
a
dull
anxiety
filled
the
place
in
her
heart
left
empty
by
her
motherly
care
for
him
one
afternoon
when
ulrich
was
out
she
took
the
letters
from
the
postman
and
a
note
from
paulchen
fell
into
her
hands
which
increased
her
anxiety
it
ran
dear
papa
and
dear
mamma
it
is
nice
here
and
i
should
like
to
come
home
at
once
and
i
am
very
frightened
and
we
have
to
get
up
at
six
in
the
morning
and
then
i
get
the
morning
banging
from
the
boys
because
i
am
the
youngest
if
i
was
not
the
youngest
some
one
else
would
get
the
banging
but
as
i
am
the
youngest
i
get
it
after
dinner
there
is
the
afternoon
banging
and
after
supper
the
evening
blessing
and
that
hurts
worst
of
all
lotzen
is
the
strongest
boy
he
can
spin
a
top
splendidly
but
he
does
everything
else
badly
but
he
says
it
matter
because
he
is
going
to
be
a
general
his
uncle
is
a
general
and
that
is
why
he
will
be
a
general
too
i
should
like
to
be
a
landowner
i
wish
i
was
not
so
frightened
how
is
fido
and
now
i
must
say
your
paul
it
is
days
to
christmas
one
of
the
boys
has
counted
it
up
a
sharp
struggle
went
on
that
day
within
her
she
stood
before
paulchen
photograph
stared
at
it
wrung
her
hands
and
pressed
them
against
her
brow
in
sheer
fear
her
face
lengthened
what
will
be
the
end
of
it
she
stammered
what
can
be
the
end
of
it
then
she
threw
herself
on
the
sofa
cried
prayed
and
finally
resolved
to
keep
the
letter
a
secret
from
her
husband
for
she
knew
what
he
was
she
knew
that
he
would
never
consent
to
the
child
staying
another
moment
in
a
place
where
his
life
threatened
to
become
a
torment
to
him
but
his
being
brought
back
must
be
prevented
at
any
cost
or
her
ends
could
never
be
achieved
she
felt
driven
to
resort
to
means
of
watching
over
the
fate
of
her
child
as
a
loving
mother
without
making
ulrich
a
participator
in
her
anxiety
there
was
an
old
in
the
house
minna
by
name
who
in
other
days
had
been
her
confidante
and
factotum
she
had
taken
letters
to
leo
and
had
mounted
guard
for
them
at
the
garden
gate
more
lately
she
had
rendered
assistance
in
the
more
harmless
goings
on
with
the
boys
of
the
neighbourhood
she
was
always
on
the
spot
when
wanted
and
when
it
was
necessary
to
cloak
and
mask
things
that
same
evening
felicitas
shut
herself
in
her
sanctum
and
with
a
fluent
pen
wrote
the
following
answer
my
dearest
paulchen
you
must
never
write
such
letters
to
papa
again
then
poor
papa
as
you
know
is
often
ill
and
if
you
cause
him
anxiety
he
will
distress
himself
and
get
worse
you
would
not
like
to
make
him
worse
would
you
happily
i
have
managed
to
keep
your
last
letter
from
him
for
the
future
you
must
only
write
to
papa
that
you
are
feeling
happy
and
getting
on
well
but
if
you
would
like
to
pour
out
your
heart
to
your
mamma
put
your
little
letter
in
one
of
the
enclosed
envelopes
then
it
will
reach
me
safely
through
old
minna
who
sends
her
love
to
you
as
to
the
treatment
you
have
to
put
up
with
from
your
schoolfellows
i
shall
probably
write
and
complain
of
it
to
the
for
such
roughness
certainly
ought
not
to
be
allowed
in
a
meant
only
for
boys
of
good
family
but
do
you
think
you
have
exaggerated
a
little
my
darling
boy
what
they
do
to
you
is
done
in
fun
you
know
and
then
you
want
to
grow
up
a
brave
man
and
so
you
must
try
and
bear
teasing
and
laugh
at
pain
have
you
thought
of
that
a
thousand
kisses
my
own
sweet
paulchen
from
your
very
loving
mamma
she
addressed
half
a
dozen
envelopes
with
the
address
under
which
she
had
received
other
clandestine
letters
it
was
fräulein
minna
huth
münsterberg
poste
restante
then
she
put
all
together
into
a
big
envelope
and
rang
for
old
minna
to
whose
secret
care
she
entrusted
the
missive
the
a
withered
hag
with
a
large
face
in
which
her
toothless
jaws
incessantly
champed
rejoiced
in
the
new
intrigue
she
clung
to
her
beautiful
young
mistress
with
the
faithfulness
of
a
pampered
dog
and
her
only
ambition
was
to
be
useful
to
her
paulchen
scrawls
would
be
as
safe
in
her
hand
as
formerly
the
outpourings
of
amorous
souls
the
danger
of
the
little
boy
return
was
thus
averted
but
felicitas
was
no
happier
she
longed
so
intensely
to
see
leo
for
once
alone
she
had
proved
that
she
understood
how
to
sound
the
depths
of
his
soul
but
it
was
clear
as
daylight
that
he
avoided
being
with
her
he
always
chose
with
punctilious
exactitude
the
hours
for
his
visits
when
ulrich
was
to
be
found
in
the
yard
and
turned
invariably
towards
the
stables
instead
of
dismounting
before
the
portico
is
this
the
reward
for
the
sacrifice
i
have
made
in
becoming
reconciled
with
him
she
asked
herself
but
she
did
not
take
into
consideration
that
the
only
existed
in
imagination
in
her
heart
estrangement
she
almost
thought
of
resorting
again
to
the
old
flirtations
for
distraction
enjoy
yourself
deaden
yourself
with
the
old
pleasures
she
said
to
herself
so
that
he
will
see
how
things
are
with
you
and
approach
you
again
but
she
hurled
the
temptation
from
her
looking
into
her
mind
and
probing
it
to
the
sad
depths
she
saw
clearly
that
she
must
spurn
low
standards
and
dishonest
means
if
she
was
to
preserve
the
power
of
conjuring
up
the
beautiful
and
pathetic
picture
which
she
delighted
to
dwell
on
as
the
reflection
of
her
soul
be
noble
let
your
motives
be
exalted
a
voice
said
within
her
perish
like
a
vestal
who
offers
up
body
and
soul
as
a
sacrifice
renunciation
is
beautiful
how
wonderful
without
desires
or
inclination
to
fade
slowly
away
a
shiver
ran
through
her
as
the
word
fade
echoed
within
her
she
repeated
it
with
trembling
lips
then
she
went
to
the
mirror
folded
her
hands
and
contemplated
herself
for
a
long
time
so
fair
so
young
yet
fated
to
wither
and
die
a
picture
of
queen
marie
antoinette
came
into
her
mind
representing
her
in
prison
with
folded
hands
behind
a
glancing
heavenwards
chaste
and
resigned
she
fetched
a
lace
fichu
which
she
knotted
loosely
on
her
bosom
the
resemblance
seemed
to
her
most
striking
though
in
reality
her
pretty
face
had
nothing
at
all
in
common
with
the
haughty
features
of
the
daughter
of
the
hapsburgs
so
fair
and
so
young
to
perish
thus
she
repeated
she
almost
fancied
that
she
felt
the
cold
steel
of
the
guillotine
fall
upon
her
neck
poor
poor
queen
she
whispered
and
tears
of
belated
compassion
filled
her
eyes
the
uneasiness
which
leo
distance
caused
her
gave
her
no
more
peace
of
mind
indeed
every
day
it
grew
worse
so
that
at
last
after
thinking
and
thinking
it
over
she
conceived
an
enterprise
the
boldness
of
which
nearly
took
her
breath
away
the
only
road
to
halewitz
for
her
she
knew
lay
over
threshold
and
she
resolved
to
take
it
do
you
find
she
said
at
lunch
to
ulrich
in
a
low
voice
that
your
intercourse
with
leo
leaves
much
to
be
wished
for
as
regards
freedom
ulrich
gave
her
a
hurried
alarmed
look
was
it
then
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
that
which
he
had
hardly
dared
own
to
himself
she
confided
to
him
her
observations
his
visits
were
too
rare
and
too
fleeting
and
above
all
he
seemed
to
think
he
must
hold
aloof
from
her
it
has
never
occurred
to
me
he
said
much
relieved
but
my
dearest
she
replied
we
women
have
quicker
insight
into
such
things
i
rejoice
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
over
his
scruples
but
they
are
really
no
longer
necessary
and
that
there
may
be
no
further
doubt
about
the
sincerity
of
my
forgiveness
and
that
you
too
may
not
doubt
it
mistrustful
man
i
propose
that
we
order
round
the
new
landau
this
afternoon
and
drive
over
to
halewitz
he
was
so
astounded
that
he
nearly
dropped
his
but
your
rupture
with
johanna
he
asked
i
thought
you
were
deadly
enemies
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
laughing
lightly
women
squabbles
she
explained
i
can
easily
put
that
right
i
never
asked
you
the
reason
of
that
feud
said
he
but
perhaps
now
the
time
has
come
when
i
may
do
be
curious
beloved
she
whispered
and
at
this
moment
noticing
that
the
bailiffs
had
done
rolling
up
their
serviettes
she
threw
them
a
friendly
gesegneter
mahlzeit
accompanied
by
a
fascinating
smile
which
filled
the
poor
devils
who
were
a
long
way
off
being
society
men
with
extreme
delight
does
it
seem
uli
as
if
the
whole
of
your
staff
were
in
love
with
your
little
wife
she
asked
when
they
were
alone
together
nestling
within
his
arm
to
receive
the
customary
kiss
after
meals
he
was
going
to
administer
an
affectionate
rebuke
for
this
kind
of
pleasantry
was
abhorrent
to
him
when
he
remarked
that
her
whole
body
trembled
with
excitement
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
in
alarm
she
drew
away
from
him
quickly
with
me
she
laughed
what
should
be
the
matter
the
carriage
will
be
round
at
four
yes
xix
on
the
outskirts
of
halewitz
park
half
hidden
in
the
shrubs
there
stood
a
lonely
grey
house
the
five
windows
of
which
were
surrounded
by
stucco
spirals
and
flourishes
which
gave
it
an
air
of
incongruous
frivolity
the
front
looked
out
on
a
field
path
while
the
gable
and
back
walls
were
buried
in
the
greenery
of
the
park
no
sound
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
courtyard
of
the
great
house
penetrated
here
only
from
time
to
time
a
plough
or
a
harvest
waggon
passed
on
its
way
home
and
the
melodious
shout
of
a
woman
voice
the
joyous
barking
of
a
playful
dog
echoing
it
came
through
the
thicket
every
morning
at
an
early
hour
a
troop
of
poorly
though
neatly
clad
children
and
barefooted
aged
from
three
to
seven
assembled
at
the
gate
the
little
ones
holding
the
hands
of
their
elders
or
in
some
cases
led
by
their
mothers
wretched
prematurely
faded
creatures
bowed
to
the
earth
with
the
double
burden
of
work
in
the
fields
and
at
seven
the
iron
gate
opened
and
the
children
streamed
into
the
pleasance
climbed
the
steps
and
disappeared
into
the
house
almost
directly
afterwards
the
shrill
chorus
of
children
voices
was
to
be
heard
by
on
the
road
led
by
a
deep
slightly
cracked
woman
alto
when
the
sounded
from
the
other
side
of
the
park
the
door
opened
again
and
the
little
troop
came
out
and
trotted
towards
the
village
then
all
was
quiet
again
around
the
lonely
house
only
an
anæmic
servant
girl
moved
now
and
then
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
cellar
stairs
and
the
front
door
not
till
after
the
vesper
hour
did
footsteps
light
yet
energetic
sound
from
the
direction
of
the
park
breaking
through
the
undergrowth
to
cut
off
the
curves
of
the
pathway
it
was
hertha
come
to
pay
her
daily
visit
to
her
stepmother
the
relations
between
mother
and
daughter
had
never
been
very
intimate
the
gloom
that
had
overshadowed
johanna
temperament
her
sybilline
air
the
atmosphere
of
incense
and
carbolic
with
which
she
was
surrounded
all
combined
to
repel
the
child
with
her
craving
for
light
and
joy
and
to
make
a
close
affection
between
her
and
her
stepmother
impossible
yet
in
her
innermost
heart
she
cherished
a
sentiment
of
gratitude
towards
her
as
the
benefactress
who
had
opened
a
new
world
of
love
to
her
the
homeless
one
by
introducing
her
into
her
parental
house
hertha
would
have
considered
it
her
duty
to
accompany
the
countess
prachwitz
when
after
the
explanation
with
her
brother
she
had
retired
to
the
but
her
stepmother
had
herself
opposed
the
plan
saying
she
would
rather
be
alone
with
her
god
since
which
it
had
been
the
rule
for
hertha
to
spend
an
hour
with
her
every
day
an
hour
in
which
according
to
her
lights
johanna
made
a
point
of
ministering
to
the
madcap
child
soul
hertha
had
to
read
bulky
devotional
books
into
whose
dreary
waste
of
prayers
a
fervid
hymn
flamed
up
here
and
there
like
a
bonfire
on
a
rainy
day
in
the
middle
of
such
an
improving
hour
was
it
that
mother
and
daughter
were
sitting
together
at
the
open
window
the
outside
blinds
of
which
were
let
down
so
that
a
dim
green
dusk
was
all
that
was
reflected
within
of
the
brilliant
sunlight
without
hertha
read
in
a
monotonous
voice
which
was
a
little
husky
from
a
too
prolonged
swim
the
day
before
the
good
old
formulas
by
which
for
centuries
men
in
their
direst
need
have
found
their
spiritual
daily
bread
in
the
happy
irresponsibility
of
her
sixteen
years
she
did
not
let
them
disturb
her
indeed
the
god
to
whom
she
prayed
for
the
man
she
loved
earnestly
every
night
who
spoke
to
her
comfortingly
out
of
the
rustling
leaves
and
wrathfully
in
the
rush
of
the
storm
was
on
the
whole
a
stranger
to
her
while
the
reading
was
going
on
there
was
a
knock
it
was
some
one
who
knocked
softly
and
timidly
once
and
then
after
a
pause
as
if
gathering
the
necessary
strength
a
second
time
the
countess
was
greatly
put
out
at
the
interruption
so
strictly
forbidden
at
this
hour
of
the
afternoon
go
and
see
who
it
is
and
send
them
away
she
said
hertha
went
and
opened
the
door
and
found
herself
standing
opposite
the
daintily
clad
figure
of
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
deadly
pale
who
looked
at
her
with
great
imploring
eyes
with
difficulty
she
collected
herself
sufficiently
to
ask
what
she
wanted
but
scarcely
had
the
unknown
trembling
lips
mentioned
her
name
than
there
was
a
cry
behind
her
the
countess
had
torn
the
handle
of
the
door
out
of
her
grasp
and
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
felicitas
the
strange
woman
covered
her
pale
sweet
face
dumbly
with
both
hands
and
at
the
same
moment
hertha
felt
herself
pushed
violently
out
into
the
passage
the
key
turned
twice
in
the
lock
the
lady
had
gone
in
with
her
mother
and
she
was
alone
in
the
dusk
and
then
she
ran
driven
by
a
secret
dismay
down
the
shaky
steps
through
shrubs
and
bushes
by
woodland
path
and
lawn
past
the
and
pond
to
where
joyous
laughter
rang
down
from
the
terrace
with
a
reassuring
sound
the
two
whilom
confronted
each
other
the
one
humble
and
supplicating
leaned
against
the
door
as
if
she
hardly
dared
set
one
foot
before
the
other
a
cowering
crushed
penitent
yet
triumphant
in
personal
charm
radiantly
beautiful
in
her
slender
youthfulness
of
figure
and
the
grace
of
her
movements
the
other
stood
erect
triumphantly
sure
of
victory
filled
with
a
sense
of
her
high
principle
and
stainless
morality
supreme
in
the
realm
of
virtue
invulnerable
in
suffering
and
proof
against
temptation
but
at
the
same
time
faded
and
withered
with
the
hard
lines
of
perpetual
renunciation
round
her
mouth
with
lean
throat
and
hollow
cheek
and
the
smouldering
fire
of
unattained
wishes
in
her
sunken
eyes
a
conqueror
but
also
a
defeated
woman
johanna
was
the
first
to
break
silence
have
you
considered
what
will
be
the
consequences
of
taking
this
step
she
asked
felicitas
bowed
her
head
still
lower
johanna
did
not
accept
this
gesture
as
an
answer
you
seem
to
have
a
short
memory
she
burst
forth
contemptuously
i
have
thought
it
all
over
and
remember
everything
felicitas
breathed
then
you
are
prepared
for
your
husband
eyes
being
opened
to
what
you
are
for
the
first
time
felicitas
gave
her
a
direct
look
touching
hopeless
yet
withal
collected
why
wait
till
she
said
in
the
same
low
tone
he
is
here
a
faint
colour
spread
over
johanna
face
here
do
you
mean
in
this
house
no
over
at
the
castle
what
for
it
is
a
long
time
since
he
was
there
i
asked
him
to
come
johanna
the
two
women
looked
at
each
other
for
a
while
in
silence
one
full
of
suspicion
the
other
of
seraphic
resignation
then
johanna
drew
a
step
nearer
felicitas
you
are
playing
a
dangerous
game
she
said
i
want
to
end
it
johanna
and
that
is
why
you
have
brought
him
i
thought
i
would
make
it
simple
for
you
johanna
again
silence
reigned
then
johanna
said
with
averted
eyes
why
do
you
stand
at
the
door
you
may
come
nearer
if
you
like
thank
you
whispered
felicitas
she
approached
an
armchair
with
quaking
knees
and
clung
to
the
back
for
support
speak
out
said
johanna
what
has
brought
you
here
necessity
murmured
felicitas
the
necessity
of
my
soul
johanna
laughed
out
loud
really
your
phrases
are
as
good
as
ever
and
what
can
i
do
for
your
soul
necessity
despise
and
scout
me
said
felicitas
you
have
the
right
but
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
am
no
longer
what
i
was
i
am
not
the
same
as
i
was
when
you
cast
me
off
then
i
was
cowardly
and
bad
i
come
back
to
you
purified
and
courageous
and
the
reason
that
i
stand
before
you
thus
johanna
is
her
face
lighted
with
enthusiasm
is
because
he
in
the
two
years
of
our
married
life
has
made
me
what
i
am
i
owe
it
to
him
johanna
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
thought
of
the
gossip
in
everybody
mouth
about
the
flirtations
of
the
fair
chatelaine
of
uhlenfelde
your
reputation
is
not
above
reproach
felicitas
said
she
is
that
also
his
doing
what
johanna
i
mean
what
people
say
about
you
i
must
ask
you
then
first
what
it
is
people
say
about
me
no
but
i
am
too
proud
to
defend
myself
that
i
can
make
such
a
boast
is
his
doing
likewise
and
she
spread
out
her
arms
while
in
her
mind
she
replaced
name
with
leo
johanna
passed
her
hand
over
her
brow
as
if
she
would
clear
away
some
confusing
impression
there
was
something
in
the
bearing
of
this
creature
indeed
which
formerly
she
had
not
been
acquainted
with
and
it
wrung
from
her
an
unwilling
sympathy
again
i
ask
what
is
it
you
want
with
me
felicitas
smiled
faintly
wo
you
let
me
sit
down
it
has
cost
me
something
to
come
here
and
it
was
true
enough
that
she
was
ready
to
drop
but
she
waited
for
johanna
gesture
of
consent
before
she
sank
into
the
chair
against
which
she
had
been
leaning
for
so
long
her
eyes
closed
and
she
drew
a
deep
breath
then
she
began
to
talk
in
a
subdued
tone
it
is
like
being
in
a
dream
johanna
i
can
hardly
believe
that
i
shall
attain
that
peace
of
mind
after
which
i
have
been
groping
for
years
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
have
once
had
any
real
joy
in
what
is
mine
your
image
has
stood
between
us
it
has
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
had
got
everything
by
stealth
and
so
you
have
johanna
broke
in
harshly
yes
as
if
i
had
robbed
some
one
worthier
of
the
position
you
see
that
so
long
as
i
live
at
his
side
i
carry
about
with
me
the
thought
that
my
fate
is
in
your
hands
and
now
i
feel
that
what
you
resolved
to
do
would
be
my
salvation
but
what
have
i
not
had
to
endure
before
i
reached
this
point
and
as
if
shuddering
at
the
thought
of
the
past
she
cowered
back
in
the
chair
johanna
had
regained
her
how
well
she
knew
these
languishing
glances
these
veiled
tones
her
eyes
sharpened
by
hate
saw
through
all
the
pretty
wiles
and
artifices
as
through
a
glass
case
her
gaze
rested
unmercifully
on
the
cowering
one
and
only
waited
for
her
to
reveal
her
hand
then
woe
to
her
felicitas
suspected
all
this
the
lean
sister
of
charity
with
the
lofty
bosom
felicitas
thought
it
must
be
padded
with
virtue
was
more
difficult
to
deal
with
than
her
brother
the
dear
overgrown
schoolboy
but
even
she
had
her
weak
spot
even
she
and
with
folded
hands
and
softly
breathed
words
felicitas
went
on
with
the
history
of
her
suffering
and
struggles
it
was
very
much
the
same
as
what
she
had
confided
to
leo
on
the
isle
of
friendship
only
a
little
altered
to
suit
the
special
case
a
blend
of
and
of
declarations
of
ardent
attachment
to
her
husband
and
outbreaks
of
torturing
fear
of
him
a
tossing
between
consciousness
of
unworthiness
and
the
impulse
to
lose
this
consciousness
in
new
unworthy
acts
all
this
poured
out
in
a
stream
of
humility
and
penitence
radiated
by
the
magic
reflection
of
a
soul
hungry
for
beauty
and
love
how
much
she
believed
of
it
herself
she
scarcely
knew
in
her
easily
impressionable
mind
which
she
could
play
with
as
one
plays
with
a
spoilt
child
truth
changed
into
lies
and
lies
into
truth
as
the
emergency
required
now
she
had
reached
in
her
story
the
first
meeting
with
leo
she
halted
for
she
had
not
had
time
to
consider
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
which
of
the
three
motives
she
should
make
use
of
that
suggested
by
the
world
that
which
made
out
it
had
been
done
for
ulrich
sake
or
that
which
was
really
the
true
one
be
be
noble
and
not
petty
a
voice
said
within
her
and
she
told
the
truth
of
course
it
was
not
the
truth
by
a
long
way
but
only
what
she
took
for
the
truth
at
the
mention
of
the
first
letter
to
leo
johanna
gave
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
then
she
froze
again
into
her
stony
aspect
but
watched
her
enemy
with
ravenous
eyes
felicitas
had
nearly
finished
it
seems
as
if
it
would
all
be
in
vain
she
concluded
what
i
have
tried
to
do
for
ulrich
happiness
if
i
do
succeed
in
bringing
about
a
reconciliation
between
our
families
that
is
to
say
between
you
and
me
johanna
laughed
shrilly
ulrich
must
come
in
and
out
here
felicitas
said
eagerly
as
he
used
to
in
old
times
without
any
fears
about
injuring
the
honour
of
his
wife
now
johanna
you
know
why
i
came
this
is
the
game
i
am
playing
i
feel
and
see
that
i
have
lost
it
for
you
only
answer
me
with
scoffing
laughter
if
you
laugh
again
i
shall
know
there
is
no
further
hope
and
then
suddenly
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
seizing
johanna
skirts
cried
sobbing
no
do
laugh
do
laugh
forgive
me
do
let
me
be
ruined
be
my
refuge
and
rock
of
strength
i
am
devoured
by
a
longing
for
absolution
you
are
pure
a
saint
will
you
show
me
the
right
way
guide
and
help
me
to
repent
pray
for
me
and
teach
me
to
pray
let
me
come
to
you
when
my
guilt
is
driving
me
to
distraction
and
despair
let
me
kneel
and
weep
like
this
at
your
feet
she
made
an
attempt
to
embrace
johanna
knees
but
she
who
had
been
looking
down
on
her
with
hard
compressed
lips
quickly
drew
herself
away
and
picking
up
the
train
of
her
dress
stepped
by
her
listen
to
my
answer
she
said
you
have
laid
your
scheme
very
skilfully
that
must
be
admitted
but
you
are
in
error
if
you
imagine
i
do
see
through
you
you
and
i
understand
each
other
felicitas
there
can
be
no
fencing
between
us
i
take
very
little
interest
in
you
now
i
say
of
you
what
the
apostle
paul
said
of
the
heathen
are
they
to
me
that
i
should
judge
them
what
are
you
to
me
that
i
should
condemn
or
forgive
you
you
must
make
your
own
reckoning
with
what
you
call
life
but
if
you
think
that
i
shall
quietly
stand
by
and
look
on
while
you
draw
my
brother
into
your
toils
for
a
second
time
and
ruin
him
body
and
soul
oh
jesus
cried
felicitas
however
much
she
might
have
planned
and
rehearsed
this
interview
that
bitter
cry
from
the
depths
of
her
tormented
soul
had
not
been
in
the
programme
even
johanna
seemed
for
a
moment
impressed
by
it
then
she
quickly
took
up
again
the
thread
she
had
dropped
naturally
you
deny
it
you
are
an
adept
at
playing
the
innocent
to
be
quite
open
with
you
i
myself
have
been
instrumental
in
my
approaching
you
as
a
means
of
putting
an
end
to
your
insane
conduct
for
your
husband
house
must
be
cleansed
at
any
price
but
it
was
not
your
place
to
make
the
first
advance
for
you
to
do
it
was
shameless
if
not
something
worse
the
foundation
of
your
soul
is
overgrown
by
rubbish
and
weeds
but
they
shall
be
dug
up
a
gleam
of
secret
terror
flitted
over
the
unhappy
countenance
she
rose
slowly
and
threw
herself
into
the
armchair
this
is
the
reward
one
gets
for
speaking
the
truth
she
thought
i
might
just
as
well
have
used
the
ulrich
pretext
and
the
rest
would
have
been
simple
was
she
now
to
throw
up
the
game
as
lost
no
not
yet
she
felt
that
the
highest
trump
of
all
was
up
her
sleeve
but
she
was
quite
sure
how
to
play
it
so
like
one
who
was
at
the
last
gasp
and
resigned
she
said
very
well
send
for
him
i
am
ready
johanna
fixed
her
eyes
on
her
piercingly
as
if
she
expected
a
new
trick
then
she
caught
hold
of
the
but
let
it
fall
again
you
still
think
that
i
am
in
joke
she
asked
while
felicitas
apparently
calm
followed
every
movement
of
her
hands
with
a
pained
smile
i
think
that
you
are
bent
on
ruining
me
she
replied
and
that
is
enough
why
should
i
wish
to
do
that
because
you
hate
me
johanna
johanna
came
nearer
to
her
and
in
a
voice
which
seemed
nearly
to
choke
her
she
hissed
in
her
ear
i
will
be
honest
yes
i
hate
you
i
never
hated
my
husband
as
much
as
i
hate
you
but
that
is
not
here
or
there
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
in
hand
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
you
might
lead
as
and
sinful
a
life
as
you
pleased
i
should
care
but
you
have
laid
hands
on
those
who
are
dear
to
me
i
could
tear
my
own
eyes
out
over
it
why
should
i
spare
you
this
is
the
right
moment
thought
felicitas
and
pressing
her
hand
to
her
beating
heart
she
said
with
the
same
air
if
that
is
the
reason
johanna
you
and
i
are
quits
after
all
what
do
you
mean
do
you
see
that
you
yourself
are
laying
hands
on
some
one
dear
to
you
johanna
shrank
back
a
little
her
eyes
opened
wide
with
a
fixed
expression
as
if
she
beheld
in
front
of
her
this
approaching
evil
and
felicitas
continued
do
you
see
that
it
will
hurt
are
you
afraid
that
it
may
kill
him
but
you
are
strong
and
you
are
so
great
johanna
that
you
would
rather
he
died
than
remained
the
possession
of
one
unworthy
of
him
all
i
say
is
that
you
ought
to
have
done
sooner
what
you
intend
to
do
it
should
have
been
done
before
habit
had
made
him
used
to
the
new
conditions
i
speak
of
because
i
dare
mention
love
in
your
presence
johanna
spread
her
trembling
hands
on
the
table
and
felicitas
continued
in
a
still
humbler
and
more
resigned
tone
perhaps
my
imagination
paints
things
too
black
perhaps
he
may
recover
from
the
blow
which
is
to
be
dealt
him
for
it
lies
with
you
johanna
to
repair
this
day
work
and
to
help
him
to
forget
it
johanna
started
up
her
eyes
pierced
the
face
of
her
opponent
anxiously
what
are
you
trying
to
convey
to
me
she
stammered
felicitas
went
on
with
her
plaintive
smile
i
only
know
this
johanna
that
i
i
shall
not
recover
from
it
whether
he
shoots
me
whether
i
throw
myself
into
the
river
i
do
care
perhaps
neither
will
happen
he
is
so
kind
and
noble
and
i
i
am
so
afraid
of
death
maybe
i
shall
perish
in
shame
and
misery
somewhere
for
i
am
rudderless
johanna
i
count
for
nothing
in
any
case
i
shall
be
cleared
out
of
the
way
from
henceforth
i
shall
be
as
good
as
dead
as
you
said
johanna
there
can
be
no
fencing
between
us
least
of
all
why
then
conceal
anything
she
opened
her
arms
we
love
him
both
of
us
i
as
much
as
you
this
is
the
ground
of
our
hate
johanna
cried
aloud
she
made
a
motion
with
her
fingers
as
if
she
would
spring
on
the
defenceless
woman
then
collapsed
on
to
the
sofa
and
buried
her
face
in
the
cushions
felicitas
licked
her
lips
with
the
point
of
her
little
red
tongue
which
was
a
habit
she
had
she
was
quite
sure
now
that
the
would
be
left
untouched
she
came
closer
to
the
prostrate
form
and
was
going
to
lay
her
hand
on
her
shoulder
when
she
recollected
herself
and
cautiously
withdrew
a
few
steps
the
only
thing
we
have
to
consider
she
began
anew
is
his
happiness
if
you
are
certain
johanna
that
you
can
secure
it
better
than
i
can
i
will
yield
to
you
willingly
and
even
if
i
did
not
wish
i
am
bound
to
do
so
because
i
am
in
your
power
but
i
am
weary
of
all
this
anxiety
and
unrest
and
i
do
it
of
my
own
free
will
and
now
you
see
there
is
really
no
reason
why
we
should
hate
each
other
any
more
it
might
be
possible
that
together
we
may
hit
on
a
way
which
will
spare
him
the
worst
pain
for
do
forget
that
when
he
loses
me
he
loses
his
friend
at
the
same
time
whom
he
values
more
highly
than
anything
on
earth
johanna
raised
herself
and
cast
her
wildly
rolling
eyes
up
at
the
crucifix
which
with
its
white
arms
shone
out
of
the
twilight
oh
my
saviour
she
moaned
how
could
i
want
to
do
it
how
couldst
thou
permit
that
i
should
want
to
do
it
do
distress
yourself
felicitas
went
on
and
now
she
really
did
lay
her
hand
on
the
heaving
shoulder
nothing
has
actually
happened
yet
and
therefore
i
will
make
another
proposal
to
you
i
will
leave
his
house
and
write
to
him
from
münsterberg
me
i
see
that
i
ca
make
you
happy
you
have
made
a
mistake
i
set
you
free
choose
the
woman
who
is
worthy
of
you
at
this
johanna
turned
round
abruptly
clung
to
her
and
seemed
as
if
she
would
have
drawn
her
head
down
to
hers
and
kissed
her
but
the
moment
she
felt
the
cool
soft
arms
of
the
woman
she
had
so
long
hated
touch
her
throat
she
tore
herself
away
shuddering
and
rushed
to
the
window
to
put
as
much
distance
as
possible
between
her
and
the
fair
smiling
sinner
from
this
coign
of
vantage
she
began
speaking
i
have
allowed
myself
to
be
cajoled
by
you
felicitas
i
am
now
as
defenceless
as
yourself
you
say
that
i
love
aye
i
love
him
triumph
over
me
then
for
you
have
him
and
i
can
do
nothing
but
pray
for
him
but
what
do
you
know
of
how
i
love
him
i
might
as
well
say
to
you
i
do
love
him
and
in
your
sense
it
would
be
a
lie
my
love
is
spiritual
and
partakes
of
worship
i
want
nothing
further
from
him
to
worship
him
is
the
same
to
me
as
belonging
to
him
i
love
him
as
i
love
the
risen
lord
the
saint
who
will
one
day
kneel
with
me
before
throne
but
what
do
you
understand
of
love
like
this
you
all
jeer
at
me
no
but
you
do
despise
me
you
have
a
slight
inkling
into
what
i
feel
and
you
envy
me
but
nevertheless
you
have
no
idea
of
what
it
is
of
what
it
is
at
night
to
see
the
gates
of
heaven
open
and
the
glory
of
god
flame
down
and
the
white
wounds
of
the
saviour
begin
to
bleed
such
a
miracle
has
happened
here
more
than
once
and
she
contemplated
the
crucifix
hanging
over
the
with
great
hungry
eyes
felicitas
cringed
she
had
begun
to
be
afraid
it
seemed
to
be
true
what
people
said
that
johanna
fanaticism
had
driven
her
out
of
her
mind
when
the
latter
saw
her
shiver
she
broke
into
a
laugh
you
are
frightened
she
said
i
can
well
believe
it
no
lies
no
mask
have
any
avail
with
the
naked
bleeding
one
come
give
me
your
hand
the
imperious
command
met
with
no
resistance
felicitas
drew
nearer
and
felt
her
hand
seized
by
one
as
if
in
fever
why
do
you
tremble
asked
johanna
you
ought
to
be
glad
for
now
i
am
in
your
power
as
much
as
you
are
in
mine
you
are
afraid
to
meet
the
eyes
of
the
crucified
but
look
well
do
you
know
who
has
eyes
like
those
no
said
felicitas
and
you
pretend
to
love
him
oh
you
dissembler
now
listen
either
your
mind
is
pure
and
clear
as
gold
like
the
blood
that
flows
from
those
wounds
and
i
have
been
deceived
in
you
or
it
is
an
abysmal
sink
of
iniquity
beyond
my
capacity
to
measure
in
this
life
the
truth
is
about
halfway
between
the
two
thought
felicitas
but
we
will
leave
that
if
you
desire
that
our
enmity
shall
be
over
from
this
hour
you
will
not
refuse
to
take
the
oath
i
require
of
you
it
wo
be
so
awful
thought
felicitas
and
with
downcast
eyes
she
replied
i
am
not
afraid
of
any
oath
then
kneel
down
why
where
asked
felicitas
nervously
here
on
my
stool
very
well
even
that
i
will
do
said
felicitas
and
knelt
as
she
was
bidden
carefully
drawing
aside
her
festive
skirts
as
she
did
so
place
your
hands
on
the
saviour
feet
felicitas
dared
not
refuse
when
the
tips
of
her
fingers
came
in
contact
with
the
cold
marble
she
cowered
and
shivered
she
felt
as
if
an
icy
stream
ran
over
her
from
those
white
feet
which
threatened
to
freeze
the
blood
in
her
veins
but
she
held
out
bravely
and
then
in
a
low
slightly
tremulous
voice
she
repeated
the
words
johanna
dictated
to
her
like
a
confirmation
candidate
kneeling
in
white
muslin
at
the
altar
stammering
forth
her
confession
of
faith
i
swear
to
thee
merciful
lord
i
confess
and
protest
in
thy
name
that
i
am
filled
with
penitence
for
my
sin
and
shall
be
penitent
till
my
life
end
if
nothing
further
occurs
she
thought
meanwhile
i
will
cherish
no
other
thought
no
other
wish
than
to
repent
what
has
happened
ulrich
happiness
and
honour
shall
be
my
expiation
and
my
only
object
in
life
till
he
dies
amen
added
felicitas
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
was
going
to
get
up
hastily
but
johanna
held
her
down
on
the
stool
we
have
done
yet
she
said
and
laughed
between
her
clenched
teeth
felicitas
thought
i
do
care
and
prepared
herself
to
repeat
further
what
was
poured
into
her
ear
in
broken
whispers
mingled
with
hot
gasping
waves
of
breath
if
my
heart
is
not
pure
if
i
take
this
oath
as
a
blind
felicitas
hesitated
a
little
to
test
herself
no
it
was
no
blind
she
really
meant
what
she
was
promising
if
in
future
i
set
my
desires
on
vain
pleasure
or
nourish
sinful
wishes
so
shalt
thou
punish
me
through
the
dearest
i
possess
thou
shalt
shame
me
in
the
sight
of
all
men
thou
shalt
shame
me
in
the
sight
of
all
men
repeated
felicitas
and
looked
timidly
round
her
the
child
thou
hast
given
me
shall
die
was
whispered
in
her
ear
a
cold
shiver
ran
along
her
spine
and
then
she
repeated
even
this
and
i
shall
be
his
murderess
felicitas
was
silent
and
trembled
well
why
do
you
hesitate
johanna
it
is
so
awful
what
you
want
me
to
say
it
is
but
only
thus
can
i
be
sure
of
you
say
it
or
not
you
have
your
choice
and
i
shall
be
his
murderess
right
now
say
amen
amen
then
she
sank
with
her
forehead
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
she
glanced
at
her
fingers
which
had
relaxed
their
grasp
on
the
feet
of
the
crucified
as
if
she
expected
there
must
be
traces
on
them
of
the
blood
which
johanna
saw
streaming
from
the
wounds
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
had
sworn
away
her
life
as
if
with
those
last
words
the
sun
had
gone
down
never
to
rise
again
then
she
slowly
raised
herself
the
next
moment
she
felt
arms
round
her
and
the
feverish
lips
struggling
against
repulsion
pressed
to
her
own
she
returned
the
pressure
mechanically
thinking
with
a
shudder
and
this
too
is
a
kiss
johanna
seized
her
hand
now
you
can
return
to
your
place
which
you
have
occupied
as
undisputed
mistress
till
said
she
you
also
shall
have
your
way
and
may
count
me
your
friend
from
henceforth
and
now
let
us
go
over
to
them
ulrich
must
know
that
we
are
reconciled
and
leo
too
thought
felicitas
smoothing
out
the
folds
of
her
dress
which
were
crumpled
from
kneeling
as
she
walked
into
the
open
air
by
johanna
side
and
saw
the
sun
shining
in
spite
of
all
that
had
happened
through
the
leaves
she
took
comfort
for
the
first
time
the
new
position
of
affairs
seemed
already
more
familiar
the
oath
may
do
good
she
said
to
herself
it
will
at
least
keep
me
from
doing
silly
things
frau
von
sellenthin
and
ulrich
kletzingk
sat
together
on
the
terrace
keeping
up
a
somewhat
constrained
conversation
because
both
were
awaiting
full
of
impatience
lizzie
return
a
mounted
messenger
had
been
sent
out
to
the
fields
to
summon
leo
home
elly
irradiating
placid
rosy
innocence
stitched
at
her
embroidery
which
was
spread
out
on
her
knees
while
hertha
with
idle
fingers
was
on
the
for
coming
events
even
the
presence
of
ulrich
to
whom
she
had
felt
drawn
long
ago
in
the
bonds
of
a
glowing
friendship
could
not
dissipate
the
panic
which
the
mysterious
meeting
between
the
two
women
had
awakened
in
her
she
was
the
first
to
become
aware
of
their
approach
walking
close
to
each
other
they
loomed
against
the
background
of
the
park
the
one
in
her
black
flapping
weeds
resembling
a
gliding
shadow
and
the
other
like
a
white
summer
cloudlet
now
grandmamma
saw
them
coming
thank
god
she
murmured
rolling
up
her
crochet
and
giving
ulrich
a
sign
to
look
round
thank
god
he
repeated
as
he
kissed
the
old
lady
hand
now
at
last
we
are
at
peace
every
one
had
got
up
and
looked
towards
the
two
women
as
they
ascended
the
steps
of
the
terrace
well
i
do
think
it
seems
altogether
like
peace
thought
hertha
observing
the
expression
of
bitter
chagrin
which
made
her
features
appear
more
severe
and
sour
than
ever
before
her
eyes
were
searching
ulrich
face
she
looks
at
him
as
if
she
would
like
to
swallow
him
thought
hertha
and
then
she
came
under
the
spell
of
felicitas
charms
which
held
her
close
captive
oh
how
very
beautiful
she
is
she
said
to
herself
with
a
sigh
how
i
should
love
to
be
like
her
greetings
were
exchanged
and
significant
words
spoken
but
hertha
heard
nothing
being
completely
fascinated
by
the
fair
stranger
whose
smile
was
so
melancholy
and
who
knew
how
to
bow
her
head
with
such
gentle
grace
she
had
a
dim
sensation
as
if
hearing
music
low
dreamy
strange
music
which
grew
stronger
directly
the
beautiful
woman
made
a
movement
and
died
softly
when
she
sat
motionless
and
silent
when
she
kissed
her
husband
hertha
envied
him
and
when
she
greeted
elly
in
a
friendly
manner
hertha
felt
herself
alone
and
deserted
but
then
the
fair
creature
turned
to
her
and
gave
her
an
astonished
yet
exquisite
smile
hertha
glowed
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
this
is
then
countess
hertha
of
whom
i
have
often
heard
asked
frau
felicitas
whom
has
she
heard
of
me
from
wondered
hertha
without
daring
to
lift
her
eyes
and
now
she
beheld
a
rounded
hand
stretched
invitingly
out
to
her
she
would
like
to
have
rushed
at
it
to
have
kissed
it
but
in
her
awkwardness
she
could
only
lay
three
fingers
in
it
uncertainly
and
then
quickly
withdraw
them
you
are
like
a
fairy
princess
countess
hertha
she
heard
the
stranger
sweet
soft
voice
breathe
close
to
her
so
tall
and
so
proud
we
must
be
friends
oh
exclaimed
hertha
glowing
with
gratitude
for
so
much
kindness
and
what
was
more
the
beautiful
woman
threw
her
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
then
something
happened
which
she
could
not
have
explained
at
the
moment
the
stranger
lips
touched
hers
she
was
seized
anew
with
the
same
uncanny
feeling
which
her
exclamation
had
awakened
in
her
a
few
hours
earlier
as
if
turned
to
stone
she
allowed
herself
to
be
kissed
and
gasped
for
the
deadening
perfume
which
this
embrace
exhaled
streamed
over
her
and
almost
took
her
breath
away
then
she
heard
grandmamma
say
she
is
still
shy
she
has
seen
much
society
yet
dear
dear
grandmamma
and
she
nearly
crushed
the
old
protecting
hand
that
so
kindly
guided
her
stumbling
destiny
now
every
one
sat
down
on
the
terrace
and
tea
was
served
it
was
long
past
the
vesper
hour
hertha
sat
in
a
dream
and
eat
and
drank
absently
as
if
she
had
broken
her
fast
for
days
her
attention
was
first
caught
again
by
overhearing
bits
of
the
conversation
which
passed
between
her
stepmother
and
the
baron
kletzingk
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
the
conversation
itself
for
it
turned
on
the
pedagogic
principles
which
governed
ulrich
education
of
the
village
children
only
the
tone
in
which
it
was
conducted
was
extraordinary
there
was
something
like
suppressed
scorn
in
her
indifferent
words
one
moment
she
seemed
as
if
she
would
like
to
cry
the
next
she
would
collapse
into
brooding
reflection
and
her
eyes
would
be
fixed
on
his
face
full
of
stony
pain
he
on
his
side
talked
to
her
as
if
she
were
an
invalid
who
was
to
be
humoured
he
did
not
contradict
her
but
modified
at
once
anything
that
seemed
to
displease
her
and
when
she
threw
in
a
derogatory
or
incredulous
remark
with
her
nervously
trembling
lips
he
pretended
that
he
heartily
shared
her
opinion
saying
that
her
reasons
were
important
enough
to
make
him
change
his
mind
but
after
such
a
concession
he
got
hardly
more
than
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
for
answer
what
can
he
have
done
to
her
that
she
hates
him
so
thought
hertha
and
then
her
attention
wandered
again
to
felicitas
at
whom
she
stared
admiringly
in
the
middle
of
the
flagging
conversation
a
firm
footstep
was
heard
in
the
accompanied
by
the
pattering
of
the
feet
whoever
was
speaking
broke
off
before
finishing
his
or
her
sentence
every
one
sat
upright
and
glanced
expectantly
at
the
door
hertha
felt
her
heart
beating
quickly
for
an
instant
her
eyes
met
those
of
the
beautiful
woman
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
pale
face
had
grown
a
shade
paler
the
door
was
flung
back
and
leo
burst
on
to
the
terrace
suddenly
he
paused
and
drew
back
his
hand
fidgeted
with
the
ends
of
his
beard
his
eyes
fastened
on
felicitas
with
a
searching
threatening
gaze
he
does
like
her
was
hertha
inward
comment
ulrich
went
up
to
him
quickly
and
seized
his
hand
what
you
see
here
old
man
means
reconciliation
now
we
are
all
going
to
enjoy
ourselves
together
at
last
you
two
asked
leo
indicating
with
his
finger
the
two
women
yes
certainly
we
are
reconciled
responded
johanna
with
her
bitterest
smile
he
was
going
to
say
more
when
ulrich
admonished
him
think
of
the
children
he
said
it
is
to
be
hoped
now
that
you
will
not
disdain
to
shake
hands
with
me
sister
leo
said
i
have
come
here
expressly
with
that
purpose
answered
johanna
rising
their
hands
touched
and
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
to
him
her
hand
said
i
hold
you
in
its
hollow
and
her
glance
be
careful
then
he
turned
to
greet
felicitas
with
a
fleeting
smile
i
wonder
why
he
does
like
her
hertha
asked
herself
rather
puzzled
at
everything
xx
it
was
late
in
the
evening
of
the
following
day
hertha
already
half
undressed
stood
at
the
bedroom
window
and
looked
at
the
moon
her
breast
heaved
under
its
burden
of
woe
she
had
just
written
to
her
best
friend
ada
ada
von
wehrheimb
with
whom
since
they
were
at
school
together
she
had
been
supposed
to
share
every
joy
and
sorrow
the
letter
with
two
postscripts
lay
on
the
table
at
last
she
had
had
the
courage
to
tell
her
friend
of
the
utter
wreck
of
all
her
hopes
and
having
once
written
her
woes
she
realized
as
she
had
not
done
before
their
full
extent
for
till
now
a
vague
mistrust
of
herself
had
prevented
her
taking
her
own
suffering
altogether
seriously
and
when
one
wanted
to
feel
thoroughly
unhappy
there
were
so
many
little
things
to
interrupt
one
the
cocks
and
hens
the
foals
the
the
swing
elly
silly
chatter
archery
and
last
but
not
least
grandmamma
and
her
on
the
other
hand
friends
and
nourishers
of
the
unhappy
mood
were
poetic
greetings
by
elise
polkos
leo
the
dog
embroidery
and
above
all
the
moon
slowly
it
sailed
now
above
the
rustling
treetops
the
true
september
moon
big
white
and
cold
with
sharply
defined
shadows
visible
in
its
brilliant
orb
it
swept
the
grey
clouds
which
seemed
to
disperse
like
silver
dust
so
soon
as
it
touched
them
leaving
only
a
faint
mist
behind
on
the
smooth
floor
of
the
sky
the
lay
brightly
illumined
in
the
moonbeams
a
swarm
of
silvery
sparks
chased
each
other
over
the
carp
pond
directly
the
breeze
ruffled
its
waters
it
was
like
a
shower
of
skimming
a
white
body
in
the
middle
of
the
flashing
circle
of
light
rose
the
obelisk
a
clumsy
pile
of
blackness
with
corners
on
one
side
it
seemed
to
project
a
little
as
if
a
round
piece
had
been
added
on
to
it
there
and
within
this
arch
something
was
glowing
like
a
fiery
eye
hertha
looked
at
it
again
she
thought
she
must
be
mistaken
but
the
fiery
eye
did
not
disappear
it
winked
at
her
roguishly
and
pryingly
as
much
as
to
say
i
know
you
you
and
your
stupid
heart
this
heart
began
to
beat
louder
what
could
it
be
at
this
time
of
night
making
fireworks
in
the
deserted
sleeping
garden
if
you
had
an
atom
of
pluck
you
would
go
at
once
and
find
out
when
hertha
will
called
her
courage
in
question
she
was
sure
to
act
so
she
flung
a
grey
waterproof
over
her
shoulders
threw
an
inquiring
glance
at
elly
who
with
slightly
pouting
rosy
lips
slept
the
most
profound
sleep
and
in
her
slippered
feet
slid
out
into
the
corridor
where
the
moonlit
cast
a
galaxy
of
bright
shapes
on
the
long
wall
now
she
began
to
be
afraid
in
earnest
but
it
was
not
far
to
the
wicket
the
latch
clicked
and
breathing
quickly
she
entered
the
garden
the
damp
grass
of
which
struck
icy
cold
through
her
thin
stockings
all
the
time
the
fiery
eye
still
gleamed
across
at
her
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
a
lid
had
dropped
over
it
but
then
it
appeared
again
in
a
somewhat
darker
corner
one
instant
she
almost
decided
to
turn
round
but
the
next
she
was
ashamed
of
her
cowardice
and
began
to
hurry
straight
towards
the
suspicious
object
at
the
top
of
her
speed
then
suddenly
a
dog
barked
and
a
voice
that
made
her
heart
stand
still
cried
who
is
there
she
was
so
terrified
that
she
could
neither
speak
nor
move
a
step
backwards
or
forwards
as
if
glued
to
the
spot
she
stood
there
till
leo
the
dog
with
a
friendly
whine
pressed
his
damp
nose
into
the
palm
of
her
hand
who
the
devil
is
there
the
voice
called
out
once
more
and
then
figure
rose
up
like
that
of
a
huge
hun
and
began
to
stride
towards
the
tree
that
she
crouched
behind
it
only
me
she
gasped
chokingly
child
you
why
are
you
in
bed
i
could
sleep
and
so
are
running
about
late
at
night
grandmamma
ought
to
know
this
he
had
caught
hold
of
her
hand
which
in
vain
struggled
to
get
free
the
short
pipe
in
his
mouth
emitted
clouds
of
white
smoke
around
her
its
glowing
bowl
had
been
the
fiery
eye
which
had
blinked
at
her
so
suspiciously
you
are
out
yourself
she
answered
biting
her
lips
till
her
teeth
ground
together
that
is
a
different
thing
i
am
a
robust
fellow
who
can
stand
all
weathers
so
can
i
now
now
and
if
i
ca
what
does
it
matter
nothing
could
be
worse
than
my
life
is
at
present
he
made
a
sound
of
pity
with
his
tongue
child
child
he
said
are
we
beating
our
wings
again
oh
go
away
leave
me
alone
and
she
warded
him
off
with
her
elbows
she
was
not
far
from
sobbing
do
begin
the
old
game
hertha
i
have
done
anything
to
you
for
a
long
time
no
that
true
she
replied
you
have
done
anything
to
me
nothing
at
all
either
bad
or
good
he
stroked
his
beard
meditatively
as
we
are
here
child
and
it
seems
that
we
both
ca
sleep
come
and
sit
down
sit
down
beside
me
we
may
find
lots
to
talk
about
she
felt
dimly
now
i
must
defend
myself
but
how
could
she
resist
already
he
had
seized
her
by
the
shoulder
and
drawn
her
to
the
steps
of
the
obelisk
where
he
had
been
sitting
before
what
am
i
to
do
here
she
asked
cowering
down
be
sincere
out
with
it
you
are
not
happy
my
child
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
twice
not
even
she
said
he
suppressed
a
smile
come
confess
what
ails
you
we
have
all
remarked
on
the
change
in
you
grandmamma
is
beginning
to
worry
about
it
if
you
are
fond
of
her
you
will
be
sorry
for
that
eh
she
shook
her
head
struggling
with
her
tears
i
want
to
be
fond
of
everybody
everybody
yes
and
do
you
see
we
are
all
anxious
that
you
should
be
happy
do
you
understand
you
obstinate
one
do
you
only
try
to
hurt
me
and
she
thrust
her
elbows
at
him
i
he
asked
good
heavens
how
you
will
speak
to
me
always
as
if
i
were
a
child
and
that
hurts
you
she
was
silent
now
was
the
time
to
tell
him
all
that
was
in
her
heart
the
hour
of
reckoning
had
come
but
she
felt
as
if
her
lips
had
been
sealed
there
was
a
whirling
and
rushing
in
her
head
she
felt
a
sensation
as
of
a
douche
of
water
falling
from
her
crown
over
her
limbs
and
with
a
soft
sigh
she
sank
against
the
stone
he
was
afraid
that
faintness
had
attacked
her
and
supporting
her
with
his
left
arm
he
bent
his
head
down
to
hers
the
moon
lit
up
one
half
of
her
face
while
of
the
other
only
the
contour
of
the
oval
cheek
showed
faintly
against
the
darkness
be
reasonable
sweet
child
he
begged
she
did
not
move
and
he
could
contemplate
her
at
his
leisure
here
and
there
in
the
dusky
masses
of
her
loose
hair
shone
a
high
light
like
a
glowworm
and
a
few
dark
strands
waved
in
spiral
form
over
the
high
smooth
forehead
a
line
of
care
which
he
had
not
noticed
before
hovered
at
the
corners
of
her
softly
curved
mouth
taken
altogether
it
was
no
longer
the
face
of
a
child
that
lay
there
shining
white
in
the
moonlight
and
clearer
than
weeks
before
after
the
meeting
at
the
inn
there
awoke
in
his
heart
the
here
is
the
happiness
which
you
will
pass
lightly
by
the
dreamy
sunny
premonition
it
will
be
dared
no
more
arise
out
of
his
soul
depths
what
held
him
in
fetters
the
past
of
which
he
had
delusively
believed
himself
to
be
master
long
ago
ever
stretched
its
form
in
front
of
him
with
more
threatening
mien
it
filled
him
at
every
pore
with
a
dull
repellant
anguish
not
for
nothing
had
he
come
at
midnight
to
set
out
here
and
brood
over
emotions
which
would
not
exist
if
one
tried
to
define
them
with
names
but
which
suddenly
overwhelm
a
man
when
he
thinks
that
he
is
safest
from
them
not
for
nothing
had
he
foregone
sleep
he
who
at
daybreak
must
be
up
and
at
his
work
his
heart
went
out
in
a
tenderness
that
was
half
pain
to
this
naïve
immature
being
leaning
against
his
arm
full
of
the
unconscious
cravings
of
youth
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
helping
her
he
must
help
himself
he
stroked
her
cheek
with
an
unsteady
hand
come
now
be
good
sweet
child
he
said
in
a
comforting
tone
speak
unburden
your
heart
she
sighed
heavily
and
turned
her
little
head
slightly
towards
his
shoulder
as
if
she
would
like
to
nestle
there
just
the
same
as
she
was
then
he
thought
shy
and
defiant
but
completely
melted
by
kindness
she
was
still
silent
look
here
he
said
i
live
under
the
same
roof
with
you
but
of
your
life
of
your
past
i
know
absolutely
nothing
you
have
never
asked
me
about
it
she
replied
would
you
have
told
me
if
i
had
of
course
i
would
i
will
tell
you
now
this
minute
if
you
like
she
disengaged
herself
from
his
arm
an
eager
blissful
smile
lit
up
her
face
of
course
i
should
like
it
so
fire
away
the
expression
fire
away
did
not
please
her
it
seemed
scarcely
suitable
to
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
but
his
interest
so
delighted
her
that
she
quickly
forgot
the
jarring
note
god
knows
she
said
there
is
much
to
tell
after
all
so
far
i
have
had
many
experiences
and
what
i
have
had
are
mostly
stupid
do
you
remember
your
mother
he
interposed
to
give
her
an
opening
she
cast
her
eyes
up
at
the
stars
yes
thank
god
she
said
i
was
nearly
seven
years
old
when
she
died
ah
how
i
cried
we
lived
in
a
big
castle
amidst
pure
poles
the
castle
was
on
a
hill
and
it
had
a
colonnade
leading
down
to
the
weichsel
which
was
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
she
used
to
sit
in
the
colonnade
when
it
was
warm
and
the
maids
with
red
handkerchiefs
on
their
heads
carried
shawls
for
her
and
every
minute
she
would
say
jest
which
means
am
cold
and
then
they
used
to
put
another
shawl
over
her
the
long
rafts
glided
by
on
the
river
below
and
on
wednesdays
and
saturdays
the
steamboat
came
she
always
watched
the
steamboat
till
it
was
out
of
sight
and
not
a
puff
of
its
smoke
to
be
seen
and
when
it
had
quite
disappeared
she
used
to
say
and
that
meant
me
up
she
wanted
to
see
if
she
could
catch
another
glimpse
of
it
standing
up
she
had
brown
hair
and
a
face
like
wax
with
very
big
dark
eyes
there
were
always
drops
of
perspiration
on
her
cheeks
she
was
not
tall
but
rather
small
and
she
had
thin
arms
but
that
came
from
illness
and
from
grief
and
perhaps
from
ennui
for
she
said
constantly
am
very
unhappy
and
dreadfully
dull
and
your
father
where
was
he
leo
asked
her
face
hardened
into
an
expression
of
hate
i
would
rather
not
speak
of
my
father
she
answered
he
was
bad
yes
he
was
bad
and
i
shall
be
bad
too
for
i
am
like
him
good
gracious
he
remonstrated
who
put
that
nonsense
into
your
head
it
is
nonsense
she
replied
full
of
conviction
have
you
never
heard
of
darwin
yes
the
man
who
says
we
are
descended
from
monkeys
and
rot
he
was
going
to
add
but
checked
himself
in
time
and
then
there
is
heredity
you
know
about
our
all
inheriting
the
qualities
of
our
parents
our
explained
that
to
us
if
your
father
is
given
to
drink
then
you
will
drink
too
did
your
father
drink
yes
he
drank
and
so
you
are
afraid
that
you
will
become
a
drunkard
eh
no
not
that
a
girl
could
very
well
but
i
am
afraid
about
temper
what
temper
his
was
so
violent
when
he
was
in
one
of
his
rages
he
did
know
what
he
was
doing
once
he
flew
at
me
with
a
knife
horrors
how
old
were
you
then
not
quite
eight
it
was
after
mother
death
he
came
from
i
know
where
we
had
seen
him
for
two
years
and
when
he
found
out
that
nothing
had
been
left
to
him
and
that
it
was
all
mine
and
had
already
been
put
in
the
hands
of
trustees
he
was
frantic
and
it
was
then
that
he
did
it
snatched
up
the
knife
afterwards
he
took
me
with
him
when
he
travelled
about
i
was
always
to
be
with
him
because
then
he
could
get
the
money
for
my
education
and
you
understood
everything
even
then
he
exclaimed
amazed
and
deeply
moved
a
melancholy
little
smile
flitted
across
her
face
which
made
her
look
years
older
you
see
i
am
not
so
foolish
as
you
thought
she
said
i
have
cried
a
good
deal
in
my
life
oh
yes
we
were
speaking
of
the
violent
temper
well
i
have
got
it
too
if
i
am
angry
i
am
blind
and
know
what
i
do
and
my
blood
rushes
into
my
head
i
shall
come
to
a
bad
end
one
day
mamma
says
i
ought
to
pray
and
beseech
the
lord
jesus
every
day
to
change
my
bad
blood
but
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
be
right
for
if
i
have
my
bad
times
i
have
my
good
too
no
one
dreams
what
they
are
elly
for
example
you
know
what
she
is
like
always
placid
always
soft
i
believe
the
sun
shines
brighter
for
me
than
for
her
that
to
my
eyes
green
is
greener
and
the
moon
how
it
sails
up
there
she
does
see
it
she
is
always
too
sleepy
so
i
say
to
myself
often
every
unhappiness
may
be
happiness
if
one
knows
just
how
to
enjoy
things
like
that
he
laid
his
hands
on
his
forehead
and
stared
at
her
great
god
he
thought
what
magic
there
is
in
a
young
creature
like
this
she
had
talked
herself
into
a
high
pitch
of
excitement
and
without
heeding
him
went
on
yes
and
then
he
left
me
at
geneva
and
went
to
get
married
and
that
is
how
you
and
i
come
to
be
related
you
see
and
when
i
heard
that
i
had
a
new
mother
i
wept
for
joy
but
the
others
the
girls
you
know
frightened
me
and
said
will
become
of
you
now
you
have
got
for
there
we
all
talked
french
but
i
thought
to
myself
till
she
sees
you
she
will
sure
to
be
kind
out
of
pity
and
because
madame
guignaud
wished
me
to
pay
my
respects
to
her
beforehand
i
wrote
her
a
letter
but
there
was
not
much
respect
in
it
and
it
began
like
this
mère
voici
une
malheureuse
enfant
qui
vous
implore
and
so
on
however
it
did
very
well
and
when
she
came
she
was
good
and
loving
to
me
and
my
heart
leapt
out
to
her
ah
in
those
days
she
often
smiled
she
seemed
to
love
my
father
very
much
and
i
hoped
better
days
were
now
in
store
for
me
and
i
should
stay
at
home
but
properly
speaking
there
was
no
home
he
refused
to
stay
on
the
estate
my
dead
mamma
had
left
to
him
for
he
said
that
he
was
ashamed
to
be
guest
he
meant
me
by
his
own
estate
malkischken
as
you
know
was
so
dilapidated
that
we
had
to
get
the
furniture
for
three
rooms
on
hire
from
a
carpenter
in
münsterberg
that
why
we
did
stay
long
there
but
started
travelling
about
we
went
to
spa
nice
and
everywhere
it
was
the
same
the
same
waiters
and
every
morning
two
eggs
with
coffee
and
at
dinner
twelve
courses
but
if
one
was
hungry
in
between
one
had
to
starve
because
we
were
charged
mamma
was
always
sad
and
papa
always
angry
with
me
and
in
want
of
money
oh
it
was
terrible
one
day
he
flew
at
me
with
his
and
was
going
to
beat
me
when
mamma
sprang
between
us
and
said
child
shall
go
away
or
what
the
meant
i
did
understand
but
he
grew
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
the
next
morning
i
went
away
first
back
to
geneva
where
i
stayed
till
i
was
thirteen
that
is
where
ada
was
she
stopped
thinking
with
a
start
of
the
letter
she
had
left
unblotted
on
the
which
ada
ada
von
wehrheimb
my
greatest
friend
she
replied
and
turning
her
head
aside
she
added
with
a
slight
blush
she
is
engaged
already
ha
ha
he
laughed
quickly
fixed
up
well
and
then
then
then
she
lost
the
thread
of
her
narrative
for
a
moment
his
laugh
had
put
her
out
oh
then
i
went
to
hamburg
to
frau
lüttgen
whom
we
knew
in
wiesbaden
frau
lüttgen
is
the
most
noted
in
all
hamburg
oh
what
happy
times
i
had
there
frau
lüttgen
was
as
tall
and
straight
as
a
beanstalk
and
was
very
particular
about
the
pronunciation
of
she
auf
der
wenn
man
vor
dem
oder
mit
einer
oder
eine
oh
it
was
too
lovely
and
there
i
was
confirmed
for
i
was
to
be
a
protestant
although
dear
dead
mamma
was
a
catholic
and
i
was
quite
willing
to
change
for
we
all
reverenced
the
pastor
bergmann
and
when
i
was
kneeling
at
the
altar
i
prayed
to
god
with
all
my
heart
to
take
me
so
that
i
might
go
to
heaven
at
once
for
at
that
time
i
was
quite
pious
and
good
and
did
not
know
how
bad
people
could
be
and
how
bad
i
was
to
be
myself
and
you
learnt
all
that
afterwards
he
asked
smirking
rather
and
she
gave
a
little
snort
which
was
always
a
sign
that
she
was
thinking
of
her
faithless
friends
käthi
greiffenstein
and
daisy
bellepool
go
on
my
chick
he
begged
let
have
the
whole
awful
history
no
but
i
simply
tell
you
why
not
oh
dear
dear
if
i
do
your
are
sure
to
despise
me
that
i
certainly
shall
not
do
child
well
one
day
you
must
know
so
here
goes
once
once
i
was
in
love
indeed
now
you
despise
me
do
you
say
say
quite
calmly
it
does
matter
who
was
it
i
tell
you
we
ought
to
have
the
courage
of
our
sins
even
if
it
costs
us
our
head
ought
we
he
was
a
commissionaire
in
a
great
scot
dreadful
was
it
he
had
long
fair
curly
hair
very
long
and
when
we
went
for
walks
of
an
afternoon
frau
lüttgen
in
front
he
used
to
stand
at
the
door
and
make
eyes
at
me
and
i
always
got
red
like
the
donkey
i
was
now
listen
child
and
i
give
you
some
good
counsel
he
said
laughing
not
only
must
we
have
the
courage
of
our
sins
as
you
so
wisely
remarked
just
now
but
we
must
do
penance
for
them
you
mean
because
i
said
but
first
hear
how
he
behaved
i
had
two
friends
called
käthi
greiffenstein
and
daisy
bellepool
both
americans
and
that
is
why
i
hate
america
the
whole
country
from
top
to
bottom
yes
and
my
heart
felt
lighter
when
you
had
cleared
out
of
it
well
i
made
those
two
girls
the
confidantes
of
my
secrets
and
one
day
what
do
you
think
happened
novels
were
found
under
käthi
mattress
broken
heart
marble
bride
and
love
and
i
do
know
what
else
there
was
an
awful
row
frau
lüttgen
held
a
käthi
denied
everything
she
knew
nothing
about
the
books
some
one
else
must
have
put
them
in
her
bed
another
search
was
made
and
behold
in
daisy
bellepool
bed
the
same
discovery
but
besides
the
books
there
was
a
packet
of
letters
too
to
whom
why
to
me
signed
bruno
steifel
of
course
i
did
know
any
one
called
bruno
steifel
but
who
believed
me
when
i
said
so
not
a
soul
the
letters
were
answers
to
those
i
was
supposed
to
have
written
to
him
in
which
i
had
asked
him
to
get
me
novels
from
the
lending
library
as
a
knightly
service
and
testimony
of
his
love
was
it
awful
terrible
leo
said
biting
his
lips
i
was
locked
up
and
got
nothing
for
two
days
but
bread
and
water
and
slimy
lentil
soup
i
was
prayed
for
every
morning
and
evening
and
laura
below
bad
a
dream
in
which
she
saw
me
burning
in
hell
the
dream
was
made
public
at
a
committee
meeting
and
i
was
held
up
as
a
warning
example
who
knows
how
long
it
might
have
gone
on
if
i
had
thought
of
a
means
of
saving
myself
if
you
want
to
know
who
herr
bruno
steifel
is
i
said
not
go
to
the
library
the
label
of
which
is
stamped
on
the
outside
cover
of
the
books
they
will
be
certain
to
know
him
there
and
they
did
sure
enough
and
who
do
you
think
it
was
he
of
the
fair
locks
of
course
of
course
and
frau
lüttgen
goes
at
once
to
his
chief
and
tells
him
the
whole
story
herr
bruno
steifel
is
called
and
you
got
novels
out
from
the
library
he
says
and
gets
horribly
red
you
in
possession
of
letters
he
wo
answer
but
the
chief
threatens
him
with
dismissal
and
he
produces
them
the
signature
is
ever
loving
hertha
von
prachwitz
but
the
handwriting
is
now
guess
daisy
bellepool
no
käthi
greiffenstein
daisy
bellepool
mamma
wished
her
daughter
to
have
more
freedom
like
other
american
girls
so
she
was
allowed
to
go
out
alone
and
in
consequence
she
arranged
the
whole
business
was
it
disgusting
yes
disgusting
what
do
you
think
i
did
i
threw
a
jug
of
water
at
daisy
head
and
gave
käthi
such
a
black
eye
that
she
was
obliged
to
wear
bandages
for
three
days
so
bad
can
you
be
when
people
behave
badly
to
you
and
what
became
of
the
pair
he
asked
käthi
was
expelled
soon
after
but
daisy
was
allowed
to
stay
on
because
her
mamma
had
subscribed
to
the
new
school
buildings
but
it
did
her
no
good
not
any
decent
girl
would
speak
to
her
again
what
i
have
lived
through
think
of
it
then
i
came
here
to
halewitz
ah
and
how
i
love
it
though
i
have
my
troubles
even
here
she
paused
and
gave
him
a
shy
entreating
glance
as
if
she
would
say
i
know
who
has
only
to
speak
one
word
to
free
me
from
them
he
laughed
and
stretched
himself
and
then
thought
with
embarrassment
of
the
other
woman
who
had
come
into
his
house
to
disturb
its
peace
we
all
have
our
troubles
my
dear
he
said
you
too
she
asked
lifting
her
eyes
to
him
in
alarm
more
than
enough
my
child
yes
yes
i
know
she
sighed
grandmamma
is
always
talking
about
it
about
what
about
your
having
more
debts
than
you
have
hairs
on
your
head
and
that
you
often
do
know
on
saturdays
where
to
get
money
to
pay
the
wages
our
dear
respected
grandmamma
is
an
old
chatterbox
but
if
s
true
is
it
yes
the
devil
ca
deny
it
she
was
silent
and
seemed
to
be
considering
deeply
then
she
inquired
crinkling
her
forehead
for
about
how
much
longer
can
you
hold
on
hold
on
what
do
you
mean
how
long
i
mean
before
you
come
a
cropper
as
the
saying
is
ah
now
it
is
evident
you
were
educated
at
hamburg
he
said
trying
to
joke
but
she
would
not
be
evaded
could
you
hold
on
do
you
think
another
four
years
and
four
months
why
do
you
insist
on
the
fours
he
laughed
she
drew
down
the
corners
of
her
mouth
now
you
are
making
fun
of
me
she
said
and
it
is
really
rather
sad
i
am
rich
and
have
so
far
too
much
money
ah
i
you
would
like
to
lend
me
some
i
that
the
worst
of
it
she
answered
all
through
the
stupid
trusteeship
it
is
too
provoking
and
she
scuffled
her
feet
impatiently
how
much
would
you
be
prepared
to
give
me
he
asked
for
the
subject
amused
him
all
a
stab
of
melancholy
happiness
shot
through
him
that
feeling
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
recapture
before
now
he
was
obliged
to
suppress
it
and
goad
himself
into
keeping
to
the
comic
side
of
the
question
with
a
hurried
laugh
he
cried
hullo
little
one
no
one
can
call
you
stingy
an
anxious
look
was
cast
at
him
which
asked
plainly
do
you
understand
me
then
she
crouched
down
and
drew
herself
shivering
away
from
him
while
the
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
over
her
parted
lips
and
clenched
teeth
if
this
is
love
he
thought
my
name
is
not
sellenthin
a
wild
jocund
impulse
within
him
bid
him
snatch
her
in
his
arms
shout
the
house
awake
shout
to
the
whole
world
here
see
this
child
this
is
my
wife
he
knew
that
it
would
have
been
his
salvation
but
he
did
not
do
it
he
did
not
do
it
because
the
fist
of
his
giant
care
was
on
his
throat
almost
throttling
him
so
that
the
breath
was
dammed
up
in
his
broad
chest
and
his
mighty
limbs
shackled
under
the
oppressive
weight
thank
you
dear
child
thank
you
he
said
hoarsely
you
meant
it
well
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
of
you
he
bent
down
and
kissed
the
gleaming
forehead
held
up
to
him
so
candidly
there
is
still
time
cried
the
wild
voice
again
and
now
go
to
bed
he
said
it
is
getting
very
late
she
rose
silently
and
without
wishing
him
good
night
walked
away
over
the
glistening
gravel
path
and
the
darkling
lawn
to
the
garden
gate
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
reeled
he
would
have
rushed
after
her
but
he
was
as
one
paralysed
because
he
was
no
longer
certain
of
his
honour
he
feared
to
lose
his
sense
of
shame
xxi
september
was
drawing
to
its
close
despite
the
disquieting
turn
that
events
had
taken
leo
sellenthin
continued
to
live
a
fresh
healthy
and
active
life
without
its
ever
occurring
to
him
to
doubt
the
indestructibility
of
his
high
spirit
or
the
intrepidity
of
his
adherence
to
his
own
doctrine
of
right
not
once
had
he
felt
the
tragic
touch
only
a
certain
feeling
of
discomfort
had
taken
up
its
abode
within
him
he
was
like
a
man
who
wears
an
coat
and
does
know
whether
it
is
too
wide
or
too
narrow
the
naïve
which
had
sat
like
an
ornament
on
him
hitherto
was
gone
he
studied
and
examined
himself
found
flaws
in
his
nature
and
rejoiced
in
his
good
points
lively
whimsical
sallies
which
once
had
rippled
forth
from
him
carelessly
seemed
to
him
now
something
wonderful
and
striking
he
enjoyed
them
while
he
gave
them
utterance
and
was
pleased
when
they
caused
laughter
in
sharp
contrast
to
this
mood
were
his
surly
taciturn
fits
when
those
around
did
well
to
keep
out
of
his
way
but
sooner
or
later
his
original
nature
broke
through
the
clouds
again
if
it
was
only
to
scoff
cynically
at
the
past
he
wanted
to
be
healthy
and
jolly
and
he
succeeded
one
afternoon
when
leo
was
in
the
act
of
starting
to
ride
over
to
uhlenfelde
there
arrived
in
the
courtyard
puffing
and
blowing
the
hanging
cheeks
of
his
face
covered
with
sweat
the
worthy
old
pastor
brenckenberg
he
and
his
son
had
walked
over
together
but
the
latter
had
considered
it
advisable
to
disappear
in
the
direction
of
the
bailiff
quarters
not
being
sure
of
his
reception
at
the
castle
a
spirit
of
devilry
awoke
in
leo
at
the
sight
of
the
old
bigot
to
whose
philippics
he
had
as
yet
had
no
opportunity
of
retaliating
being
thus
delivered
into
his
hand
the
pastor
visits
to
his
patron
and
quondam
pupil
had
never
been
frequent
they
had
been
limited
for
the
most
part
to
pastoral
calls
when
deputations
had
to
be
received
or
clerical
matters
discussed
but
had
generally
ended
by
taking
the
form
of
solemn
drinking
bouts
for
leo
whose
cellars
were
stocked
with
fine
wines
delighted
to
pour
his
best
into
the
old
man
glass
whose
connoisseurship
failed
only
from
want
of
practice
that
was
an
accepted
and
invariable
custom
dating
from
his
father
hilarious
times
and
even
the
oldest
amongst
the
retainers
could
not
remember
a
day
when
their
pastor
had
left
the
precincts
of
halewitz
sober
hullo
old
fellow
called
leo
stretching
out
his
hand
to
him
how
is
it
we
have
met
all
this
time
uneasy
conscience
eh
a
man
of
god
has
never
an
uneasy
conscience
replied
the
pastor
with
a
grin
unless
he
has
been
drinking
water
and
he
mopped
his
shiny
face
and
bacon
neck
with
a
wait
thought
leo
you
shall
not
get
off
and
he
motioned
to
the
groom
to
unsaddle
the
mare
again
as
they
walked
up
side
by
side
to
the
portico
the
parson
whose
corpulent
figure
swayed
from
side
to
side
appeared
of
more
massive
and
powerful
build
than
his
old
pupil
although
the
latter
towered
half
a
head
over
him
leo
led
him
into
the
study
asked
him
to
sit
down
and
rang
for
christian
bring
us
a
bottle
of
sour
cooking
moselle
he
commanded
the
old
servant
gave
him
an
astonished
look
it
is
not
fit
to
drink
even
in
the
kitchen
he
took
the
liberty
of
murmuring
do
what
i
tell
you
christian
departed
shaking
his
head
and
leo
settled
himself
comfortably
opposite
the
pastor
now
let
us
hear
all
the
scandal
he
said
what
chimney
smokes
where
has
a
hair
been
found
in
the
soup
fritzchen
fritzchen
brenckenberg
rebuked
him
with
his
broadest
smile
you
should
hold
up
to
ridicule
the
shepherd
of
your
soul
he
had
always
called
him
fritzchen
why
no
one
knew
not
even
he
himself
the
pet
name
had
survived
the
decade
during
which
their
relations
to
each
other
had
so
altered
the
you
which
was
held
to
be
officially
correct
yielded
to
the
familiar
thou
when
they
sat
together
over
their
wine
sometimes
leo
gave
the
signal
but
oftenest
it
was
the
old
man
whose
heart
overflowed
in
his
cups
who
adopted
the
more
endearing
form
of
address
at
his
own
peril
christian
brought
the
wine
with
the
conscience
of
a
poisoner
and
hobbled
out
again
the
small
black
eyes
of
the
shepherd
of
souls
sparkled
with
satisfaction
under
their
fierce
bushy
brows
he
smacked
his
full
lips
the
lord
wrestler
had
doffed
his
armour
and
wanted
to
be
simply
a
man
a
weak
lusty
human
being
who
next
sunday
would
have
something
to
repent
the
bottles
looked
respectable
enough
the
wine
somewhat
pale
it
was
true
as
it
trickled
into
the
dignified
rummers
in
a
watery
stream
but
that
might
be
deceptive
he
breathed
hard
through
his
distended
nostrils
and
thrust
out
his
upper
lip
your
health
old
fellow
your
health
fritzchen
he
tasted
started
and
coughed
violently
then
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
unutterable
human
grief
and
disappointment
he
put
down
his
glass
nice
wine
remarked
leo
raising
his
forefinger
to
command
assent
the
pastor
purple
from
coughing
would
have
liked
to
spit
it
out
but
dare
fritzchen
he
said
plaintively
what
tricks
are
you
up
to
now
is
my
wine
to
your
taste
herr
pastor
i
ca
say
it
is
no
by
jove
fritzchen
i
do
understand
you
dear
pastor
you
see
that
i
drink
it
indeed
since
i
began
to
repent
my
past
sins
i
have
drunk
nothing
else
it
is
what
we
call
the
wine
of
repentance
and
crucifixion
year
an
unusually
cold
and
damp
year
as
you
will
remember
ah
exclaimed
the
pastor
suddenly
enlightened
yes
yes
old
friend
do
you
grasp
it
now
since
we
condemned
our
fritz
to
there
has
been
howling
and
gnashing
of
teeth
at
halewitz
we
do
wallow
in
luxury
here
as
david
did
with
his
bathshebas
sour
moselle
is
our
only
drink
your
health
old
boy
look
here
fritzchen
said
the
pastor
relapsing
after
his
shock
into
the
affectionate
thou
if
the
condition
of
your
conscience
compels
you
to
drink
it
that
is
your
own
affair
i
do
wish
to
hinder
any
one
in
carrying
out
their
principles
but
you
must
allow
me
if
you
please
to
be
only
an
onlooker
leo
laughed
triumphantly
in
his
face
for
this
was
what
he
expected
if
i
am
not
mistaken
my
dear
friend
you
once
expressed
yourself
in
the
following
beautiful
and
touching
words
will
i
go
and
walk
with
my
naked
soles
on
bricks
yes
you
said
you
would
do
that
for
your
david
your
fritzchen
but
now
when
it
comes
to
the
point
it
seems
that
you
ca
even
share
in
his
penitence
to
the
extent
of
drinking
a
glass
of
year
with
him
the
old
man
stroked
his
cheeks
you
take
me
for
a
fool
fritz
he
said
but
you
are
right
and
with
a
desperate
effort
he
emptied
the
glass
in
one
draught
leo
in
the
name
of
all
his
sins
did
the
same
and
refilled
the
glasses
now
fritzchen
the
old
man
began
letting
his
bulldog
glance
half
severe
half
servile
rest
on
his
squire
we
are
not
catholics
and
i
am
not
your
father
confessor
i
simply
came
here
to
talk
over
with
you
the
autumn
conference
and
with
the
lord
permission
to
drink
a
glass
of
good
wine
in
your
company
instead
you
choose
to
set
before
me
this
trash
and
to
begin
talking
of
that
cursed
business
which
has
already
caused
me
enough
headaches
began
it
old
man
yes
in
the
pulpit
that
is
my
damned
duty
and
if
you
rascals
will
carry
on
such
games
then
you
must
rail
and
swear
you
had
many
a
clout
from
me
fritzchen
and
i
have
kissed
the
hand
that
held
the
rod
he
interposed
laughing
i
thought
i
had
done
enough
but
if
i
had
known
of
you
ah
ah
you
would
like
to
make
it
good
mocked
leo
if
possible
with
pleasure
leo
seized
his
glass
health
master
pastor
fritzchen
have
mercy
i
say
drink
and
again
the
superb
glasses
made
reproachful
music
as
they
met
at
being
turned
to
such
abominable
uses
leo
uncorked
the
second
bottle
and
offered
the
pastor
a
cigar
i
beg
pardon
fritzchen
but
are
these
also
so
to
say
penitence
cigars
what
a
pity
thought
leo
i
did
think
of
that
and
he
shook
his
head
smiling
the
pastor
kindled
the
excellent
weed
forthwith
and
revelled
in
the
fragrant
clouds
there
you
sit
stretching
your
legs
in
your
splendour
said
he
and
split
with
laughter
at
the
old
fat
fellow
you
love
to
make
a
fool
of
but
do
you
imagine
that
it
makes
what
you
have
done
one
hair
breadth
better
humph
said
leo
curling
his
moustache
you
may
deluge
it
with
but
it
still
stinks
humph
came
a
second
time
from
leo
that
day
in
the
church
i
gave
you
a
scorcher
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
now
you
resent
it
that
not
pretty
of
you
fritzchen
what
i
resent
replied
leo
is
that
instead
of
coming
to
me
and
having
it
out
fair
and
straight
you
preferred
to
let
a
woman
lead
you
by
the
nose
in
the
matter
and
tried
according
to
her
receipt
to
scourge
me
into
creeping
to
the
foot
of
the
cross
howling
and
whining
my
penitence
that
not
a
manly
course
to
take
and
i
believe
that
the
old
god
of
our
fathers
himself
would
be
pleased
at
it
do
you
mean
by
this
woman
your
sister
yes
i
mean
my
sister
very
well
you
must
know
fritzchen
that
your
sister
came
to
me
a
couple
of
years
or
so
before
that
and
said
it
does
matter
what
she
said
except
that
i
tell
you
it
is
no
subject
for
joking
and
you
should
lay
it
to
heart
that
the
unhappy
story
threatened
to
prove
fatal
to
your
sister
peace
what
do
you
know
about
my
sister
peace
simply
this
she
knew
her
bit
and
i
knew
mine
so
there
was
no
beating
about
the
bush
between
us
and
when
i
saw
that
the
story
preyed
on
her
mind
i
administered
consolation
as
was
my
duty
and
as
i
could
not
procure
her
exactly
the
solatium
that
she
required
you
would
say
the
she
requires
quite
right
that
is
what
i
do
mean
failing
that
i
directed
her
to
heaven
do
laugh
in
such
a
godless
fashion
fritzchen
it
is
my
vocation
and
what
is
heaven
there
for
unless
it
is
to
help
us
on
our
way
through
this
vale
of
tears
but
it
is
not
there
to
turn
our
brains
the
old
man
frowned
in
deep
thought
and
muttered
for
that
purpose
it
is
not
there
i
agree
there
was
a
silence
leo
who
was
no
longer
in
the
mood
for
jesting
called
christian
and
ordered
a
wine
that
was
drinkable
god
reward
you
fritzchen
said
the
pastor
now
perhaps
a
few
sensible
ideas
will
dawn
in
my
addled
brain
christian
eager
to
repair
his
master
sins
against
the
clergy
brought
up
a
fiery
ranenthaler
brand
that
had
seen
the
sun
for
many
a
long
year
brenckenberg
slowly
damped
his
lips
his
little
swollen
eyes
became
mere
slits
while
with
a
shudder
of
delight
he
emptied
the
glass
then
once
more
he
was
gloomy
and
silent
are
you
satisfied
yet
leo
asked
it
a
sin
and
a
shame
he
answered
that
one
should
enjoy
self
while
talking
of
such
terrible
things
but
it
is
the
old
adam
in
us
fritzchen
the
old
adam
you
are
in
a
hurry
to
repent
said
leo
let
your
lips
dry
first
before
you
curse
with
them
the
old
man
pressed
his
fists
to
his
forehead
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
fritzchen
i
am
no
priest
after
heart
he
said
as
the
wine
began
to
bedew
his
inside
quite
the
contrary
my
body
is
a
perfect
receptacle
for
the
seven
deadly
sins
chambering
and
wantoning
to
use
biblical
language
i
have
outgrown
of
course
but
gorging
and
carousing
fritzchen
and
naughty
words
perhaps
you
would
like
a
salmon
sandwich
with
your
wine
broke
in
leo
later
fritzchen
later
our
dear
lord
and
saviour
will
have
to
be
patient
with
me
for
these
things
till
the
end
of
my
days
it
a
waste
of
labour
to
struggle
against
nature
when
i
watch
the
elders
as
they
slink
into
the
conference
lisping
and
mincing
with
a
brother
in
christ
here
and
an
god
infinite
mercy
there
how
they
cast
up
their
eyes
and
fold
their
hands
on
their
stomachs
for
sheer
and
humility
fritzchen
it
turns
my
bile
and
yet
i
envy
them
to
give
the
lean
their
due
they
live
at
least
according
to
scripture
the
fat
on
the
contrary
are
mostly
sinners
and
do
deserve
the
grace
of
amen
what
do
you
want
to
prove
by
that
argument
that
our
flesh
is
the
that
from
time
immemorial
the
flesh
has
seduced
us
into
sinful
acts
and
that
it
is
our
flesh
that
must
be
crucified
if
the
thin
are
the
saints
and
the
fat
the
sinners
interposed
leo
laughing
then
a
course
of
baths
at
schweringen
must
be
the
best
moral
cleanser
do
be
flippant
remonstrated
the
pastor
i
am
one
of
the
fat
i
am
a
sinner
many
a
time
i
feel
my
flesh
begin
to
ferment
for
pure
sinfulness
on
warm
summer
evenings
or
in
winter
by
the
fire
with
a
glass
of
grog
thousands
of
little
devils
prick
you
under
the
skin
like
pins
and
from
every
a
desire
or
an
indulgence
winks
at
you
yes
yes
fritzchen
i
know
what
bulk
is
there
is
no
mist
before
my
eyes
we
have
too
good
a
time
of
it
and
then
we
go
the
pace
and
break
our
legs
leo
smilingly
asked
to
have
the
parable
expounded
what
do
i
mean
by
it
i
mean
this
do
presume
to
come
to
me
with
such
excuses
as
passion
fate
destiny
and
all
that
nonsense
you
have
had
too
good
a
time
and
now
the
devil
has
got
hold
of
you
by
the
lappet
i
am
sorry
fritzchen
but
it
ca
be
helped
what
do
you
mean
by
the
devil
who
is
the
devil
the
devil
fritzchen
goeth
about
like
a
roaring
lion
yes
yes
you
taught
me
that
in
my
infancy
very
well
and
you
want
to
know
more
would
you
like
to
see
see
with
your
own
eyes
what
the
devil
is
like
i
should
esteem
it
an
honour
and
pleasure
you
shall
have
your
wish
he
seized
the
under
pocket
of
his
long
voluminous
coat
and
produced
with
puffs
and
groans
first
an
apple
then
another
apple
then
three
ears
of
corn
then
an
end
of
altar
candle
he
explained
a
charm
against
confiscated
it
yesterday
from
a
lout
who
stole
it
from
the
vestry
then
a
reserve
sticky
with
then
a
taper
and
last
of
all
a
leather
case
about
the
size
of
a
man
fist
of
shape
the
case
he
left
on
the
table
while
he
slowly
stuffed
the
other
miscellaneous
articles
back
into
his
pocket
he
is
in
there
the
devil
yes
undoubtedly
dear
me
take
care
i
am
going
to
open
it
the
cover
snapped
back
something
that
resembled
a
and
the
greater
part
of
which
was
wrapped
in
red
wool
came
to
light
here
he
is
said
the
pastor
exactly
as
i
have
always
supposed
him
to
be
scoffed
leo
should
have
credited
you
with
so
much
acumen
replied
the
old
man
with
imperturbable
calmness
as
he
untied
the
strings
which
fastened
the
covering
for
of
the
many
thousand
shapes
he
likes
to
appear
in
this
is
his
favourite
the
woollen
wrapper
fell
off
and
what
actually
revealed
itself
was
a
cleanly
carved
meerschaum
point
in
the
form
of
a
woman
leg
above
the
amber
shoe
which
served
as
the
mouthpiece
the
part
which
extended
to
the
knee
had
been
smoked
as
black
as
ebony
but
the
rest
through
the
protection
of
the
wrapper
had
preserved
its
natural
yellowish
white
tint
leo
laughed
heartily
but
the
old
man
maintained
his
gravity
this
is
the
method
that
i
have
discovered
of
hanging
the
devil
up
in
the
chimney
he
said
and
i
assure
you
it
affords
me
holy
joy
when
i
do
it
he
stuck
the
cigar
in
the
holder
and
smoked
with
all
the
strength
of
his
lungs
there
one
thing
that
i
do
understand
said
leo
who
now
tried
to
enter
into
the
joke
in
earnest
if
you
have
got
the
devil
so
entirely
in
your
power
why
have
you
made
him
black
all
over
the
old
man
laid
his
finger
on
his
nose
with
a
air
you
speak
like
an
ignorant
sinner
think
what
a
poor
creature
the
devil
would
be
if
he
could
get
some
concessions
from
me
and
you
just
as
i
am
hard
at
it
robbing
him
of
all
his
power
he
understands
how
to
awaken
my
pity
this
is
the
devil
peculiarity
he
attacks
us
through
our
soft
places
this
you
see
was
so
smooth
and
fair
and
white
well
i
simply
felt
as
if
i
could
so
you
see
i
entered
into
a
compact
with
him
which
was
just
to
smoke
a
stocking
on
to
him
and
to
leave
the
rest
as
it
was
by
wrapping
it
up
in
wool
and
now
do
you
see
fritzchen
that
is
our
whole
art
we
ca
render
him
powerless
but
we
can
put
socks
on
him
and
hide
the
rest
and
as
carefully
as
he
had
taken
off
the
wrappings
he
began
to
adjust
them
again
on
the
part
that
was
not
discoloured
good
gracious
ejaculated
leo
this
is
symbolism
with
a
vengeance
it
reminds
me
of
the
second
part
of
do
talk
of
to
me
fritzchen
goethe
lived
like
an
old
heathen
and
wrote
like
an
old
heathen
when
he
scanned
his
verse
he
played
with
his
five
fingers
on
the
piano
and
was
a
bit
inspired
francke
and
pusckin
composed
some
fine
and
stirring
verse
but
they
did
do
it
in
that
fashion
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
the
time
is
long
passed
when
schleiermacher
and
the
whole
lot
of
liberal
divines
were
allowed
to
quote
goethe
in
the
pulpit
as
if
he
were
one
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
besides
he
was
generally
wrong
the
eternal
feminine
draws
us
upwards
he
says
somewhere
a
very
fine
noble
sentiment
but
there
is
another
kind
of
feminine
equally
eternal
that
drags
us
down
fritzchen
till
we
do
know
at
last
whether
there
can
be
another
slough
for
us
to
sink
into
many
have
the
genius
that
helps
them
to
get
out
of
it
but
many
a
one
sticks
fast
and
the
bog
closes
over
him
leo
felt
his
blood
rise
hotly
to
his
cheeks
for
the
eyes
opposite
were
hurling
at
him
their
most
ominous
darts
he
refilled
the
glasses
the
old
man
gulped
down
his
wine
hastily
and
the
bushy
brows
began
to
twitch
it
was
a
sign
that
he
had
reached
the
stage
when
his
original
tirades
were
at
their
height
the
late
baron
round
table
at
which
he
had
sat
as
jester
had
always
greeted
this
signal
with
roars
of
laughter
leo
expected
to
find
out
now
his
old
friend
most
private
and
true
opinion
of
his
own
position
forget
the
priest
for
once
said
he
and
speak
to
your
fritz
as
one
man
and
sinner
speaks
to
another
what
do
you
think
about
my
guilt
and
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
the
pastor
shot
another
shower
of
lightning
darts
from
beneath
his
shaggy
brows
the
billows
of
his
chin
champed
up
and
down
as
if
he
would
crack
the
difficult
nut
between
his
ivory
grinders
look
here
fritzchen
he
began
on
bright
days
that
is
to
say
on
days
when
this
old
brain
is
bright
i
imagine
myself
to
be
god
or
i
put
myself
in
his
place
i
try
to
understand
what
passes
in
his
head
when
he
looks
down
out
of
heaven
on
us
miserable
scum
he
made
us
what
we
are
i
say
to
myself
should
he
punish
us
for
sins
which
are
his
work
also
if
you
write
all
this
to
my
consistory
fritzchen
in
spite
of
your
patronage
i
shall
have
to
go
begging
for
bread
and
office
so
keep
it
to
yourself
please
and
just
to
demonstrate
the
matter
i
go
into
the
fir
wood
near
wengern
and
find
an
i
station
myself
above
it
an
exalted
attitude
fritzchen
and
i
imagine
that
i
am
god
of
this
why
should
it
not
be
so
when
besides
the
german
emperor
there
is
a
prince
of
there
under
me
they
crawl
and
work
quarrel
and
bite
each
other
dead
i
look
on
and
grin
underneath
they
are
certainly
sinning
but
i
the
lord
god
look
on
and
grin
is
all
right
i
say
to
myself
they
sin
according
to
method
otherwise
my
beautiful
would
go
to
pieces
and
i
say
to
myself
further
the
lord
god
is
amused
at
the
sins
of
men
because
they
are
nothing
more
than
the
evidence
of
his
laws
he
wants
sin
as
well
as
virtue
otherwise
he
would
not
have
created
it
leo
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
he
had
not
hoped
for
such
conciliatory
views
from
this
hard
old
fanatic
but
the
latter
immediately
proceeded
to
add
a
damping
rider
make
merry
too
soon
said
he
we
have
come
to
the
end
yet
this
is
so
we
can
not
know
our
poor
understanding
is
too
feeble
but
that
good
may
come
of
sin
as
good
comes
of
virtue
that
the
sinner
as
well
as
the
just
man
shall
be
answerable
to
the
same
laws
he
has
established
his
system
of
salvation
according
to
it
every
man
is
apportioned
a
certain
measure
of
sin
he
may
not
transgress
the
limits
or
the
whole
structure
would
fall
in
ruins
therefore
god
has
ordained
for
him
the
following
circular
route
penance
absolution
and
afterwards
with
renewed
zest
start
afresh
as
a
pure
man
sinning
again
because
every
one
else
does
so
all
is
done
in
order
and
each
is
allowed
the
amount
of
sin
that
he
needs
to
bring
his
old
adam
into
harmony
with
the
christian
commandments
in
short
sin
means
life
but
sin
without
repentance
is
death
leo
sprang
up
and
began
to
pace
the
room
with
long
strides
and
because
of
this
bogey
you
are
stoking
the
fires
of
hell
for
me
he
cried
the
salvation
ordinance
is
no
bogey
replied
the
old
man
that
morning
your
sister
came
and
said
to
me
is
back
lighthearted
and
gay
while
i
am
crushed
to
the
earth
under
the
weight
of
his
sin
is
that
right
i
made
answer
not
the
fellow
must
be
got
hold
of
somehow
repentance
must
be
you
lie
said
leo
and
banged
his
fist
on
the
table
till
the
glasses
danced
it
must
be
at
least
not
in
my
case
the
strong
have
their
own
code
of
morals
as
well
as
the
weak
yours
is
repent
sin
again
mine
do
repent
as
if
that
could
ever
work
it
would
have
worked
i
had
planned
it
all
and
after
long
thought
i
was
quite
clear
about
its
being
practical
would
it
do
you
think
have
been
no
penance
to
live
near
my
dearest
friend
as
if
he
did
not
exist
for
that
is
what
i
had
decided
to
do
but
then
you
meddled
you
and
the
women
and
have
hunted
me
along
a
crooked
path
to
which
i
see
no
end
and
from
which
there
is
no
turning
back
every
step
forward
is
a
lie
every
prospect
ahead
fills
me
with
new
dismay
when
i
did
repent
i
was
glad
and
strong
and
full
of
courage
but
now
there
is
some
alien
germ
in
my
blood
that
spreads
and
spreads
and
is
slowly
poisoning
my
whole
being
i
see
it
and
yet
ca
do
anything
i
shudder
to
think
what
may
be
coming
and
this
is
what
you
have
done
with
your
cursed
preaching
of
penitence
must
repent
fritzchen
drawled
the
old
man
and
emptied
his
glass
then
if
it
must
be
he
came
behind
the
old
pastor
and
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
why
have
you
let
me
bear
the
brunt
of
my
sin
alone
why
did
you
throw
me
with
that
woman
again
i
have
sinned
more
against
her
than
she
against
me
so
i
do
reproach
her
why
have
you
kneaded
me
into
such
a
pulpy
condition
that
when
she
came
and
prayed
for
my
society
i
had
no
weapon
of
resistance
left
she
had
no
further
part
to
play
in
my
life
nor
i
in
hers
and
yet
here
i
am
coupled
as
it
were
with
her
again
does
that
belong
to
the
course
of
repentance
that
you
have
prescribed
for
me
that
is
the
first
step
called
or
prostration
said
the
old
man
sagely
stop
your
drivel
roared
leo
again
i
ask
you
why
you
have
hounded
me
and
that
woman
into
each
other
arms
the
old
man
wiped
his
forehead
his
head
was
beginning
to
grow
heavy
collect
your
thoughts
demanded
leo
was
it
my
sister
idea
sister
which
sister
was
the
dreamy
answer
then
suddenly
waking
up
he
exclaimed
yes
you
are
right
quite
right
she
was
the
first
to
think
of
it
a
brilliant
idea
a
blessed
idea
then
the
souls
of
two
people
have
to
be
saved
fritzchen
and
that
is
no
trifle
save
them
then
by
all
means
but
separately
and
each
on
its
own
account
ah
you
do
understand
fritzchen
is
an
old
doctrine
jesus
christ
became
man
in
order
that
he
might
save
men
the
sinner
can
only
be
saved
through
the
sinner
you
cast
that
soul
into
the
abyss
you
alone
can
lift
it
out
and
yourself
with
her
then
it
is
written
in
romans
or
is
it
corinthians
fritzchen
he
emptied
his
glass
and
forgot
the
passage
he
was
going
to
quote
the
more
difficult
he
found
it
to
think
rationally
the
easier
seemed
the
solution
of
the
problem
under
discussion
the
matter
is
quite
simple
he
said
as
simple
as
a
b
either
you
do
repent
and
the
devil
gets
you
or
you
repent
and
the
devil
leaves
you
alone
if
you
ca
remember
it
i
write
it
out
for
you
give
me
some
more
to
drink
fritzchen
this
wine
is
and
perhaps
now
if
there
a
salmon
sandwich
going
leo
rang
and
ordered
provisions
christian
who
grasped
the
situation
respectfully
made
the
announcement
that
the
herr
kandidat
wanted
to
know
when
the
herr
pastor
would
be
likely
to
think
of
going
he
considered
that
this
little
ruse
was
permissible
is
your
son
here
too
asked
leo
in
quickly
rising
displeasure
for
he
remembered
the
song
of
the
smiling
stars
yes
he
is
there
the
spark
laughed
the
old
man
radiant
with
paternal
pride
tell
him
he
may
trundle
home
alone
i
do
want
him
christian
made
his
obeisance
and
retired
casting
reproachful
eyes
up
to
heaven
that
even
the
clergy
should
drink
too
much
seemed
to
him
a
flaw
in
the
divine
dispensation
of
the
world
that
boy
is
a
exclaimed
the
pastor
enthusiastically
you
can
have
no
conception
fritzchen
what
a
the
boy
is
why
do
you
whip
him
and
send
him
back
to
school
asked
leo
you
are
always
ready
with
your
tongue
fritzchen
but
i
tell
you
this
he
leaned
over
to
leo
lowering
his
voice
into
a
mysterious
whisper
you
can
have
no
notion
what
a
he
is
then
running
his
fingers
through
his
scant
grey
locks
he
went
on
with
renewed
enthusiasm
he
can
drink
he
has
whiskers
and
can
write
verses
ah
fritzchen
when
he
sings
his
oh
the
grand
old
days
of
youth
where
are
they
hush
admonished
leo
for
christian
was
bringing
in
the
loaded
with
cold
viands
which
had
been
ready
waiting
in
the
kitchen
for
some
time
he
vanished
directly
and
the
duels
fritzchen
fire
ready
and
there
he
stands
on
the
measure
as
i
used
to
do
when
i
belonged
to
the
westphalian
yes
fritzchen
this
old
world
is
a
fair
place
and
it
is
worth
enjoying
yourself
in
it
that
is
to
say
when
you
are
a
chap
in
the
end
of
course
the
devil
fetches
us
all
look
fritzchen
this
is
the
wing
of
a
partridge
in
jelly
now
that
reminds
me
of
a
story
i
took
my
scoundrel
of
a
son
once
on
a
visit
to
berlin
pretty
town
fritzchen
only
a
little
too
cultivated
as
for
the
preachers
and
their
sermons
no
force
there
every
sentence
a
piece
of
cooked
veal
in
raisin
sauce
where
i
should
like
to
know
does
the
christian
scourging
come
in
in
such
discourses
fritzchen
well
i
said
to
my
boy
fritz
i
mean
kurt
i
said
let
us
go
and
swell
it
for
once
i
vegetate
amidst
the
bullocks
of
wengern
but
before
i
die
i
should
just
like
to
see
and
taste
the
proper
thing
very
good
so
we
went
to
a
restaurant
all
gold
and
mirrors
and
chandeliers
and
waiters
in
one
as
we
came
in
looked
so
curiously
at
us
that
i
said
to
myself
he
staring
at
but
he
wanted
us
to
order
and
kurt
was
not
behindhand
he
order
fritzchen
there
came
first
oysters
and
truffles
in
pastry
and
sherry
then
hare
soup
bayonne
ham
with
in
champagne
fritzchen
mere
common
homely
but
in
ha
ha
ha
and
and
artichokes
and
so
on
the
fellow
with
the
white
cravat
and
the
cursed
grin
hovered
in
the
background
the
whole
blessed
time
so
i
said
to
my
boy
out
that
the
devil
and
right
enough
it
was
yes
it
was
for
when
we
got
up
to
go
what
do
you
think
the
fellow
did
he
brought
a
piece
of
paper
with
a
long
list
of
items
on
it
and
at
the
foot
a
total
of
marks
do
you
see
fritzchen
thus
it
is
with
human
life
we
may
be
as
bad
as
we
like
always
convivial
but
the
devil
stands
at
the
door
of
our
grave
and
presents
the
bill
that
why
we
we
huzzah
the
voice
of
thunder
reverberated
through
the
house
for
god
sake
stop
singing
cried
leo
or
you
completely
ruin
your
reputation
with
the
i
do
care
i
do
care
oh
the
women
ah
if
i
was
you
fritzchen
in
your
place
i
would
be
unrepentant
i
just
whistle
through
life
in
junketing
and
for
to
you
it
is
all
the
same
you
have
gambled
away
your
chances
of
eternal
bliss
the
devil
will
fetch
you
for
certain
children
fools
and
drunkards
are
supposed
to
speak
the
truth
thought
leo
and
here
is
all
three
rolled
into
one
then
he
inquired
you
do
think
there
is
any
deliverance
for
me
pshaw
deliverance
cried
the
old
man
growing
furious
deliverance
belongs
to
the
dictionary
of
those
philosopher
dogs
schleiermacher
the
rascal
would
have
talked
of
but
amongst
honest
christians
we
say
and
of
sins
yes
fritzchen
but
they
are
not
for
you
it
is
all
up
truly
one
can
never
tell
the
infinite
depth
of
christ
compassion
but
if
hell
really
does
exist
you
belong
there
do
you
know
how
i
came
to
this
knowledge
nearly
five
years
ago
fritzchen
i
tell
you
how
it
was
fritzchen
but
it
is
a
terrible
secret
you
must
close
the
door
leo
who
was
listening
with
keen
attention
reassured
him
only
speak
low
said
he
that
is
the
only
precaution
necessary
very
well
then
began
the
old
man
spitting
and
spluttering
as
he
lowered
his
voice
and
thrusting
out
his
lips
like
the
spout
of
a
one
evening
i
sat
with
my
brats
reading
the
bible
my
wife
however
was
out
in
the
kitchen
baking
apple
turnovers
i
remember
that
quite
well
some
one
came
to
the
door
whom
i
did
know
and
i
asked
him
with
apostolic
gentleness
what
do
you
want
with
me
are
to
come
at
once
and
administer
the
sacrament
said
he
cussedness
thought
i
has
a
man
arranged
to
die
on
this
day
of
all
others
just
because
i
was
going
to
sit
down
to
something
good
for
supper
the
ties
of
our
profession
fritzchen
but
when
he
let
fall
the
words
fichtkampen
and
rhaden
leo
sprang
up
he
felt
that
he
paled
i
see
my
son
triumphed
the
old
man
that
such
names
fill
us
with
disgust
but
i
ca
help
it
now
the
affair
took
another
aspect
i
forgot
my
apple
turnover
i
tore
my
gown
and
bands
from
the
pegs
packed
the
church
plate
jumped
into
the
carriage
and
was
off
like
the
wind
tell
me
exactly
what
has
happened
i
asked
he
know
all
he
knew
was
that
the
master
had
been
carried
into
the
house
covered
with
blood
at
six
that
morning
and
now
it
had
come
to
the
last
rites
did
the
doctor
arrive
fellow
doctor
was
there
said
he
at
six
in
the
morning
your
reverence
fritzchen
that
seemed
to
me
suspicious
i
get
there
house
and
yard
as
still
as
the
grave
no
one
even
to
open
the
door
to
me
at
last
a
came
corridor
parlour
salon
all
quiet
and
empty
he
still
live
happened
fought
a
duel
indeed
i
enter
the
bedroom
you
know
that
room
fritzchen
a
lamp
hangs
there
from
the
ceiling
with
a
blue
shade
fritzchen
a
blue
shade
was
it
blue
fritzchen
emptiness
here
too
is
he
in
god
name
some
one
says
and
i
hear
coming
from
the
canopied
bed
is
the
doctor
have
fetched
him
away
to
a
confinement
he
soon
be
back
where
is
the
lady
of
the
house
has
shut
herself
upstairs
in
the
spare
room
says
my
informant
i
draw
the
curtains
aside
there
he
lies
swimming
in
blood
the
stream
flows
from
his
nose
and
mouth
and
he
looks
at
me
with
eyes
glazing
and
makes
a
sign
to
me
to
wipe
it
away
so
that
he
may
speak
stop
groaned
leo
yes
i
do
doubt
it
would
suit
your
ticket
if
i
stopped
health
fritzchen
i
implore
you
not
to
go
on
i
dare
say
you
are
right
fritzchen
it
hardly
the
subject
for
a
convivial
entertainment
eh
how
did
i
hap
on
it
through
the
devil
of
course
you
see
fritzchen
that
evening
when
told
me
the
story
of
you
and
her
i
could
hear
her
running
about
overhead
i
cried
tears
of
blood
for
your
soul
fritzchen
for
you
were
dearer
to
me
than
my
own
flesh
and
blood
but
i
ca
cry
fritzchen
because
i
have
drunk
too
much
wine
you
must
forgive
me
fritzchen
he
tried
to
raise
his
fat
fingers
deprecatingly
to
leo
but
the
great
bulldog
jowl
dropped
on
his
breast
with
a
dull
wheezing
sound
in
his
throat
he
had
fallen
asleep
leo
bowed
his
head
in
his
hands
and
stared
across
at
him
with
burning
starting
eyes
thus
grimly
does
the
joke
end
thought
he
that
i
permitted
myself
to
play
off
on
my
conscience
he
shuddered
he
fancied
he
too
saw
the
glazing
eyes
of
the
dying
man
fixed
on
him
and
heard
the
rattles
in
his
throat
the
man
whose
last
curse
had
been
for
him
and
the
woman
who
had
raved
and
ramped
about
in
the
locked
above
who
left
her
husband
to
die
alone
and
forsaken
like
a
dog
because
she
dared
not
approach
him
with
her
body
he
could
almost
hear
her
sobs
and
whimperings
coming
through
the
ceiling
and
all
that
all
was
his
doing
it
will
drive
me
mad
he
cried
jumping
to
his
feet
he
longed
for
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
but
only
the
snores
of
the
drunken
old
man
fell
on
his
ear
he
would
have
given
anything
to
have
some
one
to
whom
he
could
go
to
shriek
out
the
torments
in
his
breast
but
he
had
no
one
no
one
but
that
woman
who
had
sinned
with
him
now
i
understand
why
she
clings
to
me
he
thought
and
perhaps
soon
she
will
be
as
necessary
to
me
as
i
to
her
he
remembered
the
leo
sellenthin
of
scarcely
four
weeks
earlier
and
he
came
before
him
as
a
complete
stranger
what
had
happened
in
the
meanwhile
he
did
know
restlessly
with
his
folded
hands
pressed
against
his
brow
he
ran
up
and
down
the
room
while
the
old
pastor
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
xxii
after
the
formal
reconciliation
between
the
two
neighbouring
families
leo
had
the
uhlenfelde
ferry
station
which
had
of
late
fallen
into
disuse
quickly
repaired
the
old
boat
which
seemed
to
be
now
hardly
watertight
was
replaced
by
a
new
one
and
the
drawn
up
almost
on
to
the
dyke
as
a
precaution
against
the
coming
floods
was
converted
into
a
shelter
so
that
the
waiting
groom
and
horses
could
bait
there
when
he
should
perchance
deep
in
conversation
with
his
friend
have
overstayed
the
hour
of
his
return
and
also
if
he
suddenly
took
it
into
his
head
to
slip
over
to
uhlenfelde
there
would
be
no
necessity
to
make
his
movements
known
at
the
house
he
would
only
have
to
put
up
his
horse
in
the
shelter
and
take
the
key
till
the
boat
brought
him
back
to
the
solitary
spot
where
there
was
no
fear
of
incursions
from
spies
and
eavesdroppers
this
occurred
to
him
the
day
after
the
pastor
visit
as
he
took
his
way
over
the
to
uhlenfelde
it
was
not
so
much
longing
for
his
friend
society
that
drew
him
constantly
thither
as
a
torturing
uneasiness
and
a
hungry
desire
to
know
that
all
was
going
well
there
when
he
entered
the
courtyard
he
saw
felicitas
standing
at
one
of
the
castle
windows
nodding
and
smiling
at
him
i
must
try
by
hook
or
by
crook
to
get
a
private
word
with
her
he
thought
and
returned
her
greeting
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
the
master
has
driven
in
to
münsterberg
said
the
groom
who
appeared
from
the
it
is
the
sessions
he
muttered
an
oath
the
confounded
old
priest
had
put
out
his
calculations
and
he
had
forgotten
the
day
of
the
month
and
over
there
felicitas
was
still
standing
at
the
window
smiling
to
sneak
away
now
would
be
the
action
of
a
coward
his
heart
beat
quicker
as
he
ascended
the
steps
to
the
house
since
that
day
of
the
meeting
on
the
island
he
had
never
been
alone
with
her
she
received
him
in
the
garden
salon
the
glass
doors
of
which
were
partially
closed
to
keep
out
the
autumnal
chilliness
she
sat
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
did
not
cease
smiling
this
smile
in
which
melancholy
irony
and
forgiveness
were
mingled
seemed
to
have
been
learnt
by
heart
it
almost
looks
as
if
you
were
afraid
of
me
my
friend
she
said
as
she
hesitatingly
offered
him
her
hand
in
all
my
life
i
have
never
feared
death
or
devil
he
said
forcing
himself
into
a
swaggering
tone
and
certainly
i
have
never
been
afraid
of
you
but
you
run
away
from
me
and
avoid
me
whenever
you
can
i
mind
betting
that
your
coming
is
a
mistake
had
you
remembered
that
ulrich
would
not
be
at
home
ah
he
interposed
with
a
click
of
his
tongue
but
you
can
be
quite
easy
in
your
mind
i
wo
bite
you
no
i
bite
and
she
showed
the
whole
of
her
white
set
of
teeth
as
she
laughed
he
thought
thank
god
she
is
fretting
and
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
came
back
you
stay
a
few
minutes
i
hope
she
said
lightly
i
try
and
make
up
for
ulrich
that
sounded
modest
and
ingenuous
enough
he
bowed
assent
then
let
us
go
to
my
room
she
said
there
we
sha
be
disturbed
a
slight
aversion
came
over
him
at
the
thought
of
the
boudoir
with
its
feminine
ornaments
and
luxury
and
its
heavily
perfumed
air
which
half
stifled
him
or
perhaps
you
would
rather
stay
here
she
asked
divining
with
quick
instinct
the
ground
of
his
hesitation
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
i
would
rather
she
spread
out
her
hands
a
little
gesture
which
was
meant
to
convey
that
her
only
wish
was
to
do
what
he
wished
there
was
a
short
silence
the
late
september
sunshine
filled
the
spacious
room
with
hues
autumnally
lazy
flies
buzzed
and
fell
about
on
the
window
panes
no
other
sound
disturbed
the
afternoon
peacefulness
which
seemed
almost
too
sabbatical
too
slumbrous
for
this
guilty
pair
felicitas
leaned
back
in
a
corner
of
the
lounge
and
with
a
sigh
of
deep
content
said
thank
god
why
do
you
thank
god
he
asked
that
at
last
i
have
got
you
for
once
all
to
myself
you
have
got
something
to
be
proud
of
he
said
ironically
now
now
leo
she
remonstrated
smiling
you
do
believe
half
you
say
sitting
opposite
each
other
like
this
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
draw
the
filmiest
veil
over
our
souls
or
to
hide
a
corner
of
them
from
one
another
and
that
does
one
good
especially
when
one
has
had
to
go
through
life
telling
so
many
lies
ah
i
have
so
longed
for
truth
it
is
a
kind
of
platonic
affair
you
see
that
may
be
calmly
permitted
because
it
is
quite
safe
to
lead
to
no
harm
and
this
makes
me
quite
happy
at
least
i
need
not
try
to
appear
better
than
i
am
to
as
for
you
you
sacrifice
yourself
for
my
sake
i
know
by
sitting
like
this
with
me
and
you
have
struggled
against
it
but
you
hate
me
hate
me
i
hate
you
nonsense
you
ca
deny
it
my
friend
still
i
can
put
up
with
it
your
great
grand
hate
for
i
know
that
there
is
a
little
drop
of
friendship
mixed
with
it
we
two
ah
my
god
we
two
really
ought
to
be
able
to
have
splendid
times
together
we
have
outlived
our
love
and
that
is
a
delightful
state
of
things
when
one
cares
for
a
man
and
yet
want
to
love
him
she
nestled
herself
in
the
cushions
as
if
she
were
stretching
limbs
tired
from
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
day
work
in
the
repose
of
a
cool
bed
i
might
even
go
so
far
my
friend
as
to
say
she
continued
moistening
the
corners
of
her
mouth
with
her
tongue
that
the
present
relations
between
you
and
me
are
the
most
desirable
that
can
exist
between
a
man
and
a
woman
he
laughed
almost
against
his
will
how
comical
she
was
in
her
irresponsible
perhaps
it
was
right
to
take
her
too
seriously
after
all
one
must
listen
to
her
patiently
as
one
listened
to
the
chatter
of
a
child
and
smiled
i
am
in
earnest
she
went
on
thousands
who
have
studied
human
nature
have
said
that
love
is
nothing
but
a
sort
of
war
the
woman
dislikes
the
man
desire
yet
would
dislike
still
more
to
forego
it
the
man
is
enraged
at
the
woman
resistance
yet
ca
endure
her
not
to
resist
and
give
herself
to
him
without
a
struggle
how
stupid
it
all
is
and
how
vulgar
not
till
it
is
all
over
not
till
nothing
remains
but
the
memory
of
a
few
dreamy
hours
of
bliss
and
repentance
he
interrupted
gloomily
she
gave
him
a
horrified
look
you
are
cruel
she
whispered
twirling
a
bow
of
her
dress
round
her
forefinger
i
only
wish
to
remind
you
he
replied
that
all
is
not
as
it
ought
to
be
between
us
as
if
i
did
know
it
she
sighed
you
talk
he
went
on
just
as
if
we
were
heathens
artists
or
bohemians
that
does
do
we
are
made
of
different
material
our
blood
may
be
hot
too
it
is
true
opportunity
may
turn
us
into
thieves
before
we
know
it
but
we
have
always
a
skeleton
in
the
cupboard
in
the
shape
of
our
infernal
protestant
conscience
do
talk
of
conscience
i
entreat
you
and
a
certain
residuum
of
what
is
called
sense
of
duty
ah
why
embitter
the
first
confidential
hour
we
are
passing
together
she
murmured
faintly
we
have
no
confidential
hours
to
pass
together
he
answered
roughly
she
folded
her
hands
my
god
i
know
it
i
know
all
what
i
said
just
now
was
said
to
force
my
own
conscience
into
trying
to
cheer
you
what
good
can
come
of
filling
each
other
ears
with
lamentations
he
was
silent
how
everything
was
reversed
since
that
morning
on
the
island
she
now
defended
the
standpoint
that
he
had
then
taken
up
while
he
let
himself
be
swayed
by
consciousness
of
sin
as
she
had
done
then
a
few
minutes
before
he
had
feared
nothing
so
much
as
to
hear
her
lament
now
he
himself
was
driving
her
to
it
you
are
right
lizzie
he
said
we
must
quietly
contain
ourselves
and
spare
each
other
reproaches
for
old
sins
ca
be
undone
but
the
devil
take
us
if
we
forget
the
object
for
which
we
have
entered
into
this
new
alliance
how
in
god
name
could
we
forget
it
she
cried
putting
her
hands
before
her
face
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
now
that
their
mutual
purity
of
motive
had
been
solemnly
attested
on
both
sides
afresh
he
need
no
longer
be
so
much
on
his
guard
and
might
without
suspicion
and
give
himself
up
to
the
charm
of
this
dreaded
and
indeed
it
was
not
without
its
charm
here
was
a
sympathetic
echo
to
those
thoughts
which
for
months
had
tormented
him
growing
harder
and
more
frequent
day
by
day
bound
up
as
it
were
with
every
experience
meeting
and
memory
and
yet
remaining
unspoken
so
that
their
weight
on
his
overburdened
heart
had
been
unbearable
out
of
this
pair
of
blue
swimming
eyes
his
own
guilt
looked
at
him
confidingly
softened
and
cleared
by
the
woman
grace
no
harsh
judgments
blared
from
those
soft
lips
and
when
they
whisperingly
alluded
to
a
sin
which
had
better
have
remained
unmentioned
they
did
so
with
a
mild
that
in
itself
was
for
him
forgiveness
that
was
comforting
ay
it
was
comforting
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
murmur
of
satisfaction
and
asked
if
he
might
light
a
cigar
you
know
you
may
do
anything
you
like
she
replied
and
rose
to
fetch
him
a
tray
and
matches
are
you
going
to
wait
on
me
he
exclaimed
springing
up
yes
let
me
i
like
it
and
you
know
it
not
the
first
time
she
said
with
her
melancholy
smile
he
watched
her
as
she
glided
gracefully
across
the
room
in
her
the
loose
lace
sleeves
swept
out
from
the
upper
part
of
the
rounded
arms
and
fell
in
transparent
little
folds
against
the
corset
the
stiff
whalebone
lines
of
which
were
visible
through
the
thin
dress
shooting
upwards
like
rays
into
the
full
contour
of
her
breast
where
a
satin
bow
gently
vibrated
the
figure
in
its
ripeness
and
soft
outlines
seemed
expressive
of
an
exquisite
repose
gained
after
passion
had
burnt
low
and
peace
had
been
prayed
and
fought
for
there
was
nothing
of
the
magdalene
in
it
only
her
sad
always
veiled
eyes
knew
how
to
sing
with
the
best
effect
the
song
of
sweet
sin
and
bitter
repentance
she
sank
into
her
seat
again
and
gazed
out
on
the
park
lost
in
dreams
the
rapidly
sinking
sun
flooded
the
room
with
a
purple
glow
and
painted
arabesques
of
gold
upon
the
walls
leo
occupied
with
his
cigar
let
his
eyes
follow
the
rings
of
smoke
as
they
encroached
on
the
sunlight
domain
and
were
transformed
into
clear
blue
you
are
a
great
deal
alone
now
i
suppose
he
asked
by
way
of
setting
the
conversation
going
again
nearly
always
she
answered
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
all
day
long
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
are
you
active
in
the
housekeeping
line
she
pouted
yes
but
it
bores
me
and
and
visitors
leave
you
in
peace
she
flushed
to
her
neck
what
visitors
you
know
the
youths
she
smiled
apparently
deeply
ashamed
why
do
you
remind
me
of
that
she
rebuked
him
i
shudder
when
i
think
of
the
way
in
which
only
a
short
time
ago
i
sought
my
pleasures
oh
leo
how
different
i
feel
how
much
better
and
purer
since
you
came
into
my
life
again
i
ca
say
the
same
for
myself
he
thought
remembering
what
he
had
gone
through
but
he
felt
flattered
nevertheless
at
being
recognised
as
a
good
angel
i
cling
to
you
felicitas
went
on
with
all
the
best
instincts
of
my
nature
for
i
know
that
you
are
the
one
person
who
can
help
me
and
when
i
wrestle
with
my
torture
now
she
going
to
be
tragic
he
thought
but
her
tragedy
was
no
longer
so
fatal
as
it
had
once
seemed
if
he
could
not
echo
her
way
of
expressing
things
he
understood
only
too
well
the
mood
which
prompted
her
so
to
express
herself
and
now
i
say
felicitas
continued
all
the
evil
spirits
and
goblins
of
hell
may
attack
me
i
have
got
him
he
is
there
he
will
stand
by
me
and
not
desert
me
and
so
hope
and
peace
have
dawned
in
my
soul
once
more
she
sighed
and
digging
both
her
fists
into
the
cushions
she
sat
there
and
gazed
at
him
with
parted
lips
craving
for
succour
while
her
mass
of
fair
curls
fell
about
her
ears
like
a
confusion
of
writhing
serpents
of
course
she
continued
i
relied
much
on
you
but
when
i
wanted
you
most
you
did
not
come
you
went
away
oh
leo
how
cruel
you
have
been
to
me
no
no
i
wo
hurt
you
you
are
good
good
as
an
angel
you
have
even
forgiven
me
for
forcing
my
way
into
halewitz
a
second
time
it
true
is
it
you
have
forgiven
me
and
i
have
dared
too
to
beard
johanna
to
ameliorate
her
hate
for
you
and
me
why
then
do
you
shun
me
why
may
i
not
call
on
you
when
it
is
all
darkness
and
night
within
me
and
the
ghost
of
the
slain
he
trembled
the
ghastly
picture
that
the
old
pastor
drunken
phantasy
had
invoked
rose
before
his
mental
vision
does
he
haunt
you
too
he
murmured
between
his
clenched
teeth
do
ask
i
must
be
silent
it
is
better
for
you
and
for
me
not
to
speak
of
it
then
how
could
you
have
borne
to
stay
away
from
me
if
you
had
known
known
what
another
time
i
tell
you
she
said
imploringly
another
time
when
i
feel
miserable
not
now
when
i
happy
and
breathe
freely
because
i
am
so
safe
with
you
beside
me
let
me
enjoy
this
hour
to
the
full
look
at
the
sun
melting
into
those
red
clouds
does
it
look
as
if
it
were
weeping
over
us
tears
of
blood
he
grunted
for
the
simile
seemed
to
him
extravagantly
poetic
oh
why
did
we
ever
meet
she
murmured
turning
her
face
up
to
the
setting
sun
so
that
it
became
suffused
with
a
rosy
glow
she
sighed
but
the
sigh
lost
itself
in
a
smile
as
we
are
on
the
subject
he
said
feeling
that
the
conversation
had
taken
a
dangerous
turn
but
at
a
loss
how
to
change
it
into
another
channel
meeting
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
for
a
year
or
more
we
had
associated
without
any
harm
coming
of
it
despite
the
old
flirtation
behind
us
we
should
have
been
more
careful
to
keep
our
inclinations
in
hand
that
all
rhaden
left
us
too
much
alone
we
had
too
many
opportunities
of
strolling
in
the
park
after
dark
and
sitting
in
shady
nooks
that
what
did
it
that
what
did
it
half
lying
on
the
cushions
she
propped
her
chin
in
her
hands
i
wonder
how
the
idea
first
came
into
our
heads
she
asked
dreamily
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
can
one
say
afterwards
how
such
things
happen
he
said
it
like
fever
no
one
knows
how
he
gets
it
i
remember
though
how
it
began
she
whispered
still
gazing
at
the
sun
it
was
a
july
evening
rhaden
had
something
to
do
in
the
town
we
were
in
the
arbour
under
the
cut
cypresses
you
have
got
one
like
it
at
halewitz
do
you
remember
the
arbour
why
did
she
ask
till
their
dying
hour
they
were
both
bound
to
remember
the
place
that
had
been
the
temple
of
their
happiness
and
the
origin
of
their
damnation
it
was
dark
all
round
us
we
could
scarcely
see
each
other
your
cigar
had
gone
out
you
wanted
a
light
i
said
me
help
you
and
as
i
held
the
burning
match
to
the
end
of
your
cigar
and
you
drew
in
the
flame
with
a
deep
breath
you
raised
your
hand
and
stroked
my
hand
which
held
the
match
three
times
and
just
as
it
flickered
up
for
the
last
time
our
eyes
met
and
then
i
knew
knew
that
it
would
happen
you
knew
it
already
she
nodded
and
as
if
it
were
the
fading
radiance
of
their
past
and
vanished
joy
the
reflection
of
the
sun
which
had
now
sunk
beneath
the
horizon
lay
purple
and
mysterious
on
her
face
we
women
are
quick
to
discern
that
sort
of
thing
said
she
before
you
men
know
exactly
what
it
is
you
want
we
feel
it
drawing
near
it
is
like
a
warm
draught
of
air
blowing
against
us
many
of
us
do
know
what
it
is
to
feel
well
except
in
such
an
air
if
you
noticed
so
much
why
were
you
on
your
guard
he
asked
sternly
what
is
the
use
of
guarding
against
the
decree
of
fate
she
said
piously
clasping
her
hands
why
did
you
drive
me
away
why
did
you
allow
me
to
come
back
because
i
was
so
glad
that
you
came
back
yes
yes
forgive
me
you
are
right
it
is
i
who
ought
to
have
known
and
to
have
fled
away
miles
away
it
was
not
your
fault
it
was
mine
do
be
so
hard
on
yourself
leo
she
begged
things
came
as
they
were
bound
to
come
we
were
both
defenceless
then
do
you
still
remember
how
after
the
match
was
gone
out
it
was
all
dark
in
the
arbour
and
we
were
both
quite
quite
silent
for
a
long
time
i
heard
nothing
but
your
breathing
short
and
hard
you
must
tell
me
leo
what
were
you
thinking
about
during
those
minutes
he
would
have
cried
out
leave
me
in
peace
with
your
questions
but
only
too
vividly
did
the
picture
rise
before
his
eyes
of
that
sultry
purple
july
night
which
was
the
beginning
of
all
the
mischief
what
was
i
thinking
about
he
murmured
i
do
know
that
i
thought
at
all
at
least
i
ca
recall
anything
that
i
thought
but
when
we
stood
up
and
walked
to
the
house
i
remember
that
i
asked
myself
was
it
her
shoulder
felt
so
warm
against
my
arm
i
put
it
down
to
the
hot
summer
air
but
when
i
was
in
bed
i
still
felt
your
shoulder
against
my
arm
that
i
recollect
perfectly
felicitas
looked
at
him
smiling
but
in
the
midst
of
her
smile
she
broke
into
convulsive
weeping
she
threw
back
her
head
stretched
herself
out
full
length
on
the
cushions
her
whole
body
shaken
by
her
violent
sobs
one
of
her
shoes
slipped
off
and
fell
clattering
on
the
floor
leo
shocked
and
deeply
moved
got
up
and
came
to
her
side
why
why
she
sobbed
why
must
it
have
been
so
now
i
am
wretched
and
abandoned
and
you
are
wretched
too
and
the
others
oh
jesus
have
pity
do
do
be
reasonable
he
urged
trying
to
conceal
his
fear
by
harshness
yes
yes
tell
me
what
to
do
i
will
obey
and
do
all
you
command
you
must
calm
yourself
first
suppose
some
one
came
in
his
glance
wandered
uneasily
to
the
door
oh
i
will
be
calm
directly
oh
lord
lord
felicitas
he
would
have
liked
to
shake
her
but
was
afraid
to
touch
her
with
his
hands
at
the
severity
of
his
tone
she
raised
herself
and
wiped
her
face
with
limp
hands
i
am
weak
she
stammered
please
get
me
my
flask
from
the
next
room
he
hurried
away
to
do
her
bidding
for
he
was
still
consumed
with
anxiety
that
they
might
be
surprised
in
their
present
situation
when
he
came
back
she
was
lying
motionless
face
downwards
on
the
cushions
he
called
her
name
instead
of
answering
she
pointed
to
the
back
of
her
head
he
sprinkled
a
few
drops
of
the
strongly
scented
liquid
on
her
hair
and
then
wiped
his
damp
hands
quickly
on
his
she
turned
round
now
my
forehead
she
whispered
with
closed
eyes
he
moistened
her
temples
how
kind
you
are
she
whispered
and
then
went
on
one
has
to
become
as
miserable
as
this
to
learn
what
true
compassion
is
sit
up
now
he
commanded
you
are
right
she
replied
lifting
wide
eyes
to
his
our
time
is
up
ulrich
may
be
back
at
any
minute
ulrich
the
blood
flamed
into
his
face
his
friend
name
fell
painfully
upon
him
like
a
whip
i
must
go
at
once
he
exclaimed
wo
you
wait
and
see
him
she
asked
innocently
he
shook
his
head
and
set
his
teeth
but
you
come
will
you
not
he
could
do
nothing
but
dumbly
assent
she
bent
over
the
edge
of
the
sofa
to
look
for
the
lost
slipper
which
was
hidden
somewhere
in
the
wainscotting
when
she
sat
upright
she
was
smiling
again
the
blue
eyes
had
regained
their
wonted
lustre
only
on
the
round
cheeks
flashed
in
rosy
drops
the
last
traces
of
her
tears
are
you
angry
with
me
she
asked
why
angry
because
i
have
made
this
foolish
scene
but
the
burden
of
unshed
tears
was
oppressing
my
soul
and
now
that
i
have
cried
it
away
i
feel
more
and
happier
than
i
have
done
for
months
oh
leo
let
me
thank
you
for
the
comfort
you
have
given
me
and
in
her
overflowing
gratitude
she
caught
his
two
giant
hands
in
her
soft
little
palms
and
tried
to
press
them
he
hurriedly
took
his
leave
it
seemed
as
if
something
were
hunting
him
from
the
spot
but
ashamed
of
his
haste
he
turned
once
more
at
the
door
remember
me
to
him
he
said
looking
steadily
into
her
eyes
she
nodded
and
then
bent
her
eyes
on
the
floor
when
he
had
left
the
entrance
hall
she
climbed
with
languid
steps
to
the
top
story
where
from
the
corner
balcony
there
was
a
view
of
the
stream
she
watched
him
hurrying
thither
with
her
hands
pressed
against
her
forehead
and
saw
him
unmoor
the
boat
from
the
sandy
bank
and
launch
it
with
a
mighty
shove
while
he
jumped
in
and
seized
the
oars
before
the
fragile
craft
had
time
to
drift
an
inch
with
the
current
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
in
order
to
wave
him
farewell
but
he
did
not
look
up
and
the
white
wisp
of
cambric
fluttered
unseen
in
the
twilight
the
boat
became
a
shadow
and
disappeared
she
shivered
and
thought
of
the
boy
far
away
at
the
cost
of
whose
banishment
she
had
purchased
this
hour
then
listening
cautiously
at
the
door
she
drew
a
letter
from
her
pocket
and
gazed
with
emotion
at
the
laboriously
penned
characters
and
read
once
more
the
incoherent
words
which
had
been
distressing
her
since
yesterday
my
dearest
mamma
i
am
homesick
and
how
long
must
i
stay
here
and
please
tell
me
if
i
may
come
home
for
christmas
holydays
all
the
other
boys
are
going
home
for
the
holydays
but
i
am
not
a
coward
no
i
am
not
a
bit
a
coward
and
when
they
beat
me
i
bite
my
teeth
together
and
the
banging
hurt
but
if
you
think
i
cry
i
do
no
i
only
cry
when
i
am
alone
in
the
evening
after
prayers
that
matter
does
it
and
i
pray
for
dear
mamma
and
dear
papa
that
he
be
ill
any
longer
and
i
want
fido
so
dreadfully
and
how
is
the
little
mare
i
used
to
ride
you
know
dear
mamma
i
do
hate
being
here
and
want
to
come
home
it
is
days
to
christmas
and
i
want
a
and
companion
and
a
pistol
that
you
shoot
not
with
caps
but
there
a
feather
in
it
like
an
arrow
and
the
cherry
cakes
that
old
jetta
bakes
always
and
i
long
to
see
old
jetta
too
with
kisses
from
your
loving
son
paulchen
felicitas
crumpled
the
sheet
in
her
hand
in
nervous
irritation
my
god
my
god
how
will
it
end
she
murmured
then
as
if
to
escape
from
herself
she
ran
in
from
the
balcony
and
paced
up
and
down
in
the
great
empty
attic
i
ca
i
may
i
wo
think
about
it
she
cried
thousands
of
children
have
gone
through
the
same
and
outlived
it
he
will
get
over
it
too
she
shut
the
glass
door
and
pressing
her
forehead
against
the
panes
stared
at
the
spot
where
a
few
minutes
ago
the
boat
had
disappeared
and
gradually
her
face
cleared
and
took
on
an
expression
of
dreamy
tenderness
xxiii
hertha
had
a
sharp
little
nose
and
she
had
made
therewith
a
discovery
a
discovery
which
in
happier
circumstances
would
not
have
signified
much
but
which
in
the
troubled
condition
of
affairs
carried
great
weight
as
she
sat
at
supper
which
meal
was
unusually
honoured
that
day
by
presence
she
became
aware
of
a
peculiar
perfume
the
same
which
was
indissolubly
associated
in
her
mind
with
the
memory
of
a
pale
sweetly
smiling
countenance
and
a
pair
of
big
blue
imploringly
uplifted
eyes
this
perfume
had
seemed
to
her
the
crowning
distinction
of
graceful
elegance
she
had
often
tried
to
recall
it
and
as
the
finest
scented
soap
gave
no
idea
of
it
she
resolved
that
she
would
instantly
procure
it
in
four
years
and
four
months
time
when
she
came
into
possession
of
her
fortune
and
now
as
if
wafted
by
magic
from
uhlenfelde
this
perfume
suddenly
pervaded
the
she
sniffed
it
in
inquiringly
and
measured
with
her
eyes
one
after
the
other
mamma
elly
grandmamma
but
missed
out
leo
johanna
who
sat
stiffly
at
the
table
immovable
as
a
statue
making
everybody
else
feel
uncomfortable
gave
her
stepdaughter
an
astonished
look
hertha
saved
herself
by
asking
leave
to
hand
round
the
dish
of
which
christian
had
left
in
the
lurch
to
attend
to
the
cutlets
while
she
passed
from
one
chair
to
another
she
sampled
critically
the
immediate
atmosphere
round
each
and
sure
enough
when
she
came
with
the
dish
behind
leo
place
the
insidious
fragrance
rose
to
her
nostrils
with
threefold
power
but
leo
did
not
like
scents
on
the
contrary
only
a
short
time
ago
when
christian
had
thought
it
necessary
in
honour
of
the
sabbath
to
plaster
his
grey
straggly
locks
with
he
had
been
told
with
a
to
go
and
put
his
head
under
the
pump
leo
helped
himself
to
potatoes
without
bestowing
a
glance
on
the
waitress
who
handed
them
he
seemed
distrait
and
surly
and
instead
of
eating
toyed
with
his
mamma
presence
truly
might
be
responsible
for
his
temper
but
hertha
suspected
other
causes
the
conversation
was
confined
to
monosyllabic
questions
and
answers
grandmamma
inquired
how
many
geese
were
to
be
stuffed
for
liver
and
how
many
fattened
do
as
you
like
said
leo
were
you
at
uhlenfelde
johanna
asked
suddenly
hertha
sat
erect
on
the
ah
what
would
he
say
no
was
the
short
sharp
rejoinder
he
did
not
like
to
be
least
of
all
by
johanna
who
showed
no
disinclination
to
play
the
spy
on
him
he
was
still
wondering
himself
how
the
falsehood
had
escaped
his
lips
when
he
glanced
down
the
table
and
met
hertha
large
shining
eyes
which
were
fixed
on
him
shocked
and
reproachful
the
little
one
is
getting
uneasy
he
thought
and
as
he
was
anxious
to
be
alone
he
rose
and
left
the
table
with
a
gesegneter
mahlzeit
every
one
looked
after
him
what
can
ail
him
asked
grandmamma
referring
to
the
food
he
had
scarcely
touched
he
has
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
the
foaling
put
in
hertha
acting
on
an
impulse
dimly
felt
that
it
was
her
place
to
stand
up
for
him
she
was
quite
sure
that
she
hated
him
but
all
the
same
whatever
he
did
was
no
business
of
anybody
else
after
supper
she
rushed
into
the
dusky
garden
she
felt
as
if
something
had
happened
within
her
and
without
the
existence
of
which
up
till
now
she
had
not
dreamed
she
did
know
what
it
was
or
what
to
call
it
but
that
it
was
nothing
good
was
proved
by
the
anger
which
stormed
in
her
breast
at
the
thought
of
it
what
did
it
mean
if
the
beautiful
woman
had
really
poured
some
of
her
perfume
on
to
his
coat
but
no
that
was
the
question
why
had
he
degraded
himself
by
telling
a
lie
he
the
haughty
leo
who
had
so
loftily
disdained
her
humble
love
why
had
he
made
a
secret
of
this
visit
to
uhlenfelde
when
as
a
rule
he
came
from
there
openly
bringing
messages
of
greeting
from
his
friend
of
course
this
beauty
was
a
thousand
times
more
beautiful
than
she
was
and
much
cleverer
no
doubt
it
did
not
need
much
to
accord
her
the
superiority
but
the
great
insoluble
problem
the
to
all
her
conjectures
was
that
she
was
a
married
woman
if
only
she
had
not
been
then
he
could
have
been
in
love
with
her
but
as
it
was
how
could
he
women
were
loved
by
their
husbands
that
was
what
they
married
for
but
by
no
one
else
in
the
world
otherwise
you
might
as
well
fall
in
love
with
uncle
kutowski
or
the
dog
leo
who
at
this
moment
was
rubbing
his
damp
nose
against
her
sleeve
full
of
consolatory
affection
shivering
in
the
chill
autumn
wind
and
yet
with
burning
cheeks
she
ran
up
and
down
the
paths
where
rustling
dry
leaves
whirled
before
her
like
startled
animals
she
heard
leo
voice
coming
from
the
yard
raised
to
a
scolding
pitch
as
he
inspected
the
ploughs
by
leo
the
dog
answered
with
a
joyous
bay
and
bounded
off
twice
but
returned
to
her
in
the
end
you
are
better
than
your
master
she
whispered
burying
her
face
in
his
mane
and
she
decided
that
if
possible
she
would
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
question
about
married
people
being
beloved
by
some
one
to
whom
they
were
married
first
of
all
she
sought
information
in
her
library
the
lamplighter
to
begin
with
then
goldelse
and
barefeet
these
were
the
maturist
novels
that
she
possessed
the
writings
of
clara
cron
and
otilie
wildemuth
were
as
yet
not
even
to
be
thought
of
she
could
find
any
reference
to
the
problem
that
bothered
her
not
even
a
hint
that
it
existed
so
she
turned
from
fiction
to
the
classics
schiller
amalia
was
a
young
girl
luise
now
she
was
coming
to
it
perhaps
a
married
woman
queen
of
spain
of
course
but
in
this
case
it
was
clear
as
daylight
that
you
could
believe
the
poet
for
to
be
in
love
with
your
stepmother
was
a
thing
which
could
only
happen
in
the
world
of
imagination
that
world
in
which
genius
detached
from
earth
and
intoxicated
with
inspiration
roams
at
large
she
had
written
for
nothing
a
german
composition
two
years
ago
on
genius
and
reality
in
which
this
question
had
been
exhaustively
dealt
with
those
beautiful
phrases
genius
detached
from
earth
and
intoxicated
with
inspiration
were
quotations
from
it
why
are
you
rummaging
so
amongst
the
books
asked
elly
who
was
already
in
bed
and
before
falling
asleep
enjoying
herself
by
stretching
the
counterpane
tight
between
her
teeth
and
feet
and
pretending
to
play
the
banjo
on
it
as
she
alternately
tightened
and
slackened
her
hold
on
the
linen
it
produced
sounds
high
and
low
which
distantly
resembled
those
of
a
stringed
instrument
hertha
considered
whether
she
should
demean
herself
so
far
as
to
ask
advice
from
this
child
but
in
her
dire
necessity
she
did
not
long
demur
look
here
mouse
she
said
sitting
down
by
the
head
of
the
bed
i
want
to
ask
you
something
you
are
in
love
with
a
man
are
you
oh
yes
replied
elly
playing
with
her
fingers
and
you
are
quite
sure
that
this
man
loves
you
too
why
do
you
say
asked
elly
kurt
is
my
ideal
before
it
was
benno
and
before
that
alfred
but
now
it
is
kurt
but
all
the
same
i
do
think
of
him
as
a
man
what
is
he
then
why
a
man
well
young
man
if
you
like
certainly
he
is
not
my
idea
of
a
man
and
her
eyes
gleamed
with
enthusiasm
did
she
not
know
what
a
proper
man
to
be
like
do
you
think
mouse
that
any
man
or
young
man
it
does
matter
which
could
love
a
married
woman
of
course
quite
easily
answered
elly
in
her
superb
serenity
hertha
smiled
surreptitiously
at
such
denseness
no
mouse
you
understand
she
said
i
do
mean
the
woman
who
is
his
wife
but
the
woman
who
is
married
to
some
one
else
that
what
i
mean
too
and
it
seems
to
you
quite
natural
really
i
should
not
have
thought
you
so
inexperienced
said
the
little
lady
one
bound
to
know
such
things
in
old
days
it
was
much
worse
the
man
who
was
a
brave
knight
loved
the
wife
of
some
one
else
to
love
his
own
would
have
been
thought
ridiculous
it
is
all
in
könig
history
of
literature
hertha
had
become
very
thoughtful
ah
the
olden
times
she
said
with
a
faint
smile
it
no
good
talking
of
them
they
tilted
at
tournaments
then
and
killed
each
other
with
their
lances
for
fun
and
said
elly
in
a
whisper
raising
herself
in
bed
with
the
wide
eyes
of
a
child
reading
a
fairy
tale
they
shoot
each
other
dead
with
pistols
for
a
joke
instead
hertha
felt
a
stab
at
her
hearty
and
the
little
rosy
daughter
of
eve
went
on
i
should
think
it
lovely
to
have
such
an
unhappy
affair
when
married
for
you
know
most
of
the
romantic
love
stories
are
of
this
kind
who
told
you
so
do
you
remember
what
käthi
graffenstein
said
about
her
aunt
pah
cried
hertha
whatever
said
about
it
would
sure
to
be
a
lie
the
conversation
ceased
at
this
point
for
after
elly
letting
fall
the
name
hertha
refused
to
talk
any
more
but
long
after
the
light
had
been
put
out
she
lay
awake
pondering
and
tried
by
various
experimental
thoughts
to
penetrate
the
veil
which
hung
between
her
childlike
outlook
and
life
the
next
afternoon
she
approached
with
faltering
step
kind
grandmamma
whose
wooden
were
busily
employed
on
one
of
her
favourite
shetland
wool
shawls
have
you
an
uneasy
conscience
asked
grandmamma
who
thought
she
knew
what
she
wanted
god
forbid
i
only
wish
to
know
am
i
properly
grown
up
or
am
i
not
well
half
and
half
suggested
grandmamma
giving
her
a
smiling
scrutiny
over
her
spectacles
hertha
drew
a
deep
breath
she
had
entered
on
a
daring
enterprise
she
knew
but
at
all
costs
she
must
clear
up
this
matter
i
mean
that
i
shall
probably
soon
be
married
and
i
you
exclaimed
grandmamma
in
deadly
terror
the
unhappy
child
had
evidently
come
to
break
to
her
the
proposal
of
some
saucy
youth
in
the
neighbourhood
of
course
continued
hertha
mouthing
her
words
of
course
with
all
my
money
i
am
not
likely
to
be
an
old
maid
grandmamma
caught
hold
of
her
hands
child
whom
have
you
got
in
your
mind
she
cried
beginning
to
perspire
with
anxiety
hertha
blushed
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
i
nobody
she
stuttered
struggling
to
maintain
a
nonchalant
tone
you
are
talking
indefinitely
yes
of
course
indefinitely
grandmamma
ventured
to
breathe
more
freely
again
and
determined
forthwith
that
she
would
talk
seriously
to
leo
that
very
day
and
warn
him
that
the
gold
fish
might
be
snapped
up
by
some
one
else
under
his
very
eyes
if
he
did
not
look
out
and
now
let
me
hear
what
you
want
to
know
i
want
to
know
about
love
after
marriage
grandmamma
who
was
used
to
these
sort
of
questions
though
lately
they
had
been
less
frequent
than
of
old
replied
lightly
it
the
same
after
as
before
yes
i
know
but
if
there
another
to
whom
one
is
not
married
gracious
grandmamma
let
her
glasses
fall
off
her
nose
in
sheer
horrified
amazement
what
other
hertha
felt
a
sudden
collapse
of
her
she
had
to
make
energetic
demands
on
her
courage
to
be
able
to
proceed
ca
it
happen
dear
grandmamma
that
some
one
who
is
married
to
us
can
get
into
his
head
hertha
interrupted
the
old
lady
look
me
straight
in
the
eyes
and
tell
me
if
you
have
been
reading
a
forbidden
book
how
could
i
grandmamma
what
are
you
reading
now
oh
a
yarn
that
meta
podewyl
lent
me
we
say
story
not
yarn
who
wrote
it
felix
dahn
and
what
is
it
about
i
hardly
know
some
one
is
always
being
stabbed
dead
by
some
one
else
some
of
them
come
to
life
again
and
some
of
them
are
buried
no
harm
in
that
no
certainly
there
is
no
harm
in
that
thought
grandmamma
and
then
she
said
do
come
to
me
with
such
stupid
questions
again
child
you
are
too
young
by
far
to
understand
such
things
and
now
give
me
a
kiss
and
take
your
crochet
so
another
plan
had
failed
yet
hertha
went
on
wondering
how
she
was
to
solve
the
dark
mystery
with
which
her
jealous
heart
was
so
blindly
grappling
the
same
day
at
dinner
leo
made
the
unexpected
proposal
of
rowing
her
and
elly
over
to
the
isle
of
friendship
he
knew
how
long
hertha
had
cherished
the
wish
to
see
with
her
own
eyes
the
romantic
spot
and
thought
that
by
giving
her
her
desire
he
would
improve
the
relations
between
them
which
he
did
know
why
seemed
to
grow
more
strained
from
day
to
day
but
hertha
slightly
curled
her
lips
and
remarked
many
thanks
when
i
care
to
visit
the
island
i
will
row
myself
over
you
try
again
he
laughed
yes
why
not
there
are
two
boats
there
now
and
you
ca
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
when
you
happen
to
be
visiting
uhlenfelde
there
was
something
in
her
pronunciation
of
the
last
few
words
which
vexed
and
irritated
him
nevertheless
my
dear
child
he
replied
i
must
ask
you
kindly
to
refrain
from
any
more
mad
escapades
there
really
is
no
necessity
for
you
periodically
to
rouse
the
neighbourhood
i
promise
you
that
i
shall
give
you
no
further
ground
for
complaint
on
that
score
she
made
answer
with
quivering
lips
he
nodded
immediately
pacified
and
grandmamma
changed
the
topic
to
household
matters
towards
sunset
when
leo
mounted
his
mare
hertha
watching
him
from
the
garden
felt
all
the
annoyance
and
antagonism
of
the
evening
before
awake
in
her
again
she
would
have
liked
to
throw
herself
on
the
grass
and
tear
up
the
sod
with
her
fingers
it
was
true
that
he
rode
out
in
the
direction
of
wengern
but
hertha
had
little
doubt
that
he
intended
to
make
a
the
quicker
to
reach
the
stream
oh
if
only
i
knew
whether
that
could
be
so
she
thought
and
gnashed
her
teeth
then
she
was
seized
with
a
brilliant
idea
meta
podewyl
who
had
been
transformed
these
four
months
into
a
sedate
frau
von
sembritzky
used
to
be
her
confidential
friend
before
her
engagement
they
had
exchanged
all
sorts
of
promises
and
sealed
their
vow
of
friendship
with
endless
kisses
the
first
who
should
be
the
first
to
etc
but
as
things
had
turned
out
there
had
been
no
talk
on
either
side
of
these
promises
being
fulfilled
for
the
intimate
relations
between
her
and
meta
had
ceased
as
most
girls
friendships
do
in
the
early
days
of
betrothal
and
although
she
had
followed
the
fortunate
girl
to
the
altar
as
her
bridesmaid
she
had
long
ago
seemed
to
have
vanished
into
an
unknown
world
to
which
she
lacked
a
passport
but
now
her
happiness
and
peace
of
mind
were
at
stake
and
only
meta
could
help
her
in
the
evening
at
she
said
to
elly
if
i
ask
you
to
drive
over
with
me
to
see
meta
you
must
say
you
understand
the
mouse
did
not
understand
in
the
least
but
submitted
as
usual
with
an
inclination
of
her
little
fair
head
and
fell
asleep
the
next
day
it
rained
and
as
hertha
had
no
closed
carriage
at
her
command
she
stayed
at
home
two
more
wet
days
followed
in
which
hertha
devouring
curiosity
had
to
rest
unsatisfied
but
when
a
fourth
dawned
hopelessly
grey
with
rain
pattering
on
the
windows
she
resolved
to
pocket
her
pride
and
petition
leo
through
the
medium
of
grandmamma
for
horse
and
carriage
why
these
roundabout
dealings
hertha
he
said
as
they
met
at
table
i
should
have
thought
you
knew
that
the
conveyances
are
as
much
at
your
disposal
as
any
one
else
at
two
that
afternoon
the
carriage
stood
at
the
door
and
she
drove
off
in
pouring
rain
she
was
lucky
in
the
hour
she
had
chosen
meta
husband
had
gone
into
münsterberg
and
who
made
the
young
couple
happy
by
her
presence
in
the
house
was
suffering
from
a
bilious
attack
so
she
found
meta
alone
in
her
bedroom
with
its
heavy
satin
curtains
its
dainty
muslin
covers
its
comfortable
low
sofa
and
lamp
with
shade
and
all
the
thousand
and
one
pretty
knickknacks
and
mysterious
articles
which
betoken
a
recently
accomplished
matrimonial
union
and
seem
to
invite
a
cosy
confidential
chat
still
the
reception
accorded
hertha
by
her
old
chum
was
not
altogether
encouraging
she
rose
languidly
from
the
in
which
she
had
been
reclining
looking
very
delicate
and
fragile
and
with
a
faint
smile
extended
a
cold
thin
hand
on
which
the
wide
hoop
of
her
seemed
conspicuously
to
inspire
respect
a
book
bound
in
brown
and
gold
slid
from
her
lap
on
to
the
floor
hertha
took
in
at
a
first
glance
how
much
meta
young
little
face
had
changed
during
the
months
since
her
marriage
her
nose
had
sharpened
and
her
full
lips
were
pale
and
the
different
way
in
which
her
hair
was
dressed
made
her
quite
a
stranger
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
she
said
just
as
one
dowager
receives
another
when
she
pays
her
a
formal
visit
in
fact
hertha
felt
intimidated
what
were
you
reading
she
asked
picking
up
the
book
from
the
floor
the
little
wife
blushed
hotly
and
hurriedly
took
the
book
out
of
her
hand
but
not
before
hertha
had
deciphered
the
gold
letters
on
the
back
ammon
duties
of
mothers
i
never
said
hertha
may
you
read
that
i
must
read
it
replied
the
young
wife
with
a
slightly
ironical
twist
of
her
mouth
hertha
burned
on
the
spot
to
gallop
through
the
remarkable
volume
she
would
have
liked
above
all
things
to
have
laid
it
on
her
lap
and
asked
her
friend
to
leave
her
in
peace
for
an
hour
or
two
but
she
was
too
embarrassed
to
give
any
hint
of
her
wishes
what
shall
we
have
with
our
coffee
asked
meta
momentarily
anxious
to
display
her
authority
as
mistress
of
the
house
meringues
jam
pancakes
or
can
you
really
order
anything
you
like
asked
hertha
full
of
admiring
envy
at
this
moment
she
could
almost
have
made
up
her
mind
to
accept
a
husband
who
was
not
leo
naturally
i
can
order
what
i
like
replied
her
friend
with
a
melancholy
little
shake
of
the
head
bui
she
might
have
truthfully
added
that
is
when
hans
mamma
has
a
bilious
attack
well
then
i
should
like
best
exclaimed
hertha
with
a
sigh
of
relief
for
now
they
seemed
to
be
getting
a
more
human
footing
as
she
threw
her
hat
and
cloak
in
a
corner
she
caught
sight
of
a
pair
of
pouter
pigeons
fluttering
from
the
ceiling
holding
a
corner
of
the
in
their
bills
oh
how
perfectly
heavenly
she
cried
if
i
were
married
and
might
have
everything
i
wanted
i
would
hang
a
gold
cage
up
there
with
a
nightingale
in
it
to
sing
me
to
sleep
every
night
her
friend
made
no
answer
but
she
smiled
and
this
smile
indulgent
and
sad
in
which
there
lay
worlds
of
profound
knowledge
told
hertha
that
she
had
said
something
extraordinarily
stupid
she
rubbed
her
nose
in
her
confusion
then
drew
herself
erect
again
for
it
seemed
to
her
necessary
to
recapture
her
dignity
a
further
survey
of
the
room
revealed
new
wonders
at
every
turn
on
the
toilette
table
which
like
the
bed
had
a
canopy
of
silken
gauze
draped
above
it
was
an
array
of
brushes
bottles
round
and
square
boxes
all
made
of
the
same
lapis
lazuli
glass
she
took
out
stoppers
and
lifted
covers
enviously
in
one
of
the
boxes
she
found
a
it
was
the
first
time
in
all
her
young
life
that
she
had
held
a
in
her
hand
may
you
powder
too
she
asked
meta
shook
her
head
laughing
i
might
if
i
liked
she
said
but
i
do
hertha
felt
a
burning
desire
to
guide
the
white
soft
ball
of
down
over
her
face
but
forebore
from
exposing
her
vanity
before
her
friend
i
suppose
that
you
are
very
very
happy
she
asked
thank
god
yes
replied
her
friend
in
a
tone
of
solemn
seriousness
which
hertha
could
understand
because
she
had
always
thought
happiness
was
a
laughing
matter
and
only
unhappiness
a
subject
that
required
to
be
treated
seriously
her
eyes
began
to
wander
round
the
room
again
for
she
was
keenly
anxious
to
discover
all
the
curiosities
it
contained
suddenly
she
gave
a
start
for
there
in
a
corner
she
alighted
on
a
row
of
high
of
dimensions
so
enormous
that
no
woman
feet
could
have
filled
them
how
do
they
come
there
she
asked
timidly
they
are
hans
wellingtons
replied
meta
in
a
tone
which
crushed
her
afresh
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
wellingtons
grew
visibly
to
a
still
more
gigantic
size
and
formed
an
insurmountable
barrier
between
her
and
her
friend
she
began
at
the
same
time
to
resent
the
reserve
with
which
meta
continued
to
behave
towards
her
the
days
when
they
had
sat
in
corners
together
and
giggled
and
tittered
while
they
crunched
peppermint
out
of
a
bag
that
lay
across
their
laps
and
now
and
then
flipped
each
other
behind
the
ear
seemed
gone
for
ever
she
too
is
going
to
prove
faithless
thought
hertha
and
her
heart
flamed
up
within
her
as
it
always
did
at
anything
which
recalled
the
fleeting
vision
of
treacherous
käthi
greiffenstein
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
mission
most
undoubtedly
any
one
who
was
on
such
familiar
and
intimate
terms
with
a
man
wellingtons
must
be
able
to
enlighten
her
with
regard
to
the
mystery
she
was
so
eager
to
have
explained
but
she
did
dare
yet
throw
out
any
hints
of
her
thirst
for
knowledge
they
talked
of
one
thing
and
another
meta
maintaining
her
gentle
smile
and
reticent
manner
after
about
half
an
hour
she
rose
and
explained
with
a
sigh
that
she
must
go
and
inquire
how
mamma
was
if
her
visitor
would
excuse
her
and
hertha
was
left
alone
how
could
she
make
use
of
the
time
for
she
had
settled
in
her
mind
that
she
would
make
use
of
it
only
she
was
undecided
between
duties
of
mothers
and
the
at
last
after
a
short
but
sharp
struggle
the
gained
the
day
her
eyes
guiltily
fixed
on
the
door
she
snatched
the
little
implement
and
with
a
trembling
hasty
movement
dabbed
it
over
her
forehead
and
cheeks
then
she
ventured
to
take
a
nervous
glance
at
herself
in
the
mirror
and
what
she
saw
frightened
her
it
was
the
face
of
a
corpse
now
she
knew
how
she
would
look
when
she
lay
in
her
coffin
with
a
wreath
of
myrtle
on
her
hair
and
with
roses
in
her
marble
hands
so
pale
so
beautiful
she
let
her
head
fall
as
far
back
as
possible
on
her
neck
and
dropped
her
lids
so
low
that
only
a
misty
slit
between
her
lashes
was
left
for
her
to
see
through
both
her
neck
and
the
back
of
her
head
began
to
ache
but
she
did
not
stir
had
i
been
one
quarter
so
fair
in
my
lifetime
she
thought
as
i
am
in
death
he
would
not
have
disdained
my
love
a
sweet
longing
to
shed
tears
came
over
her
but
she
did
not
give
way
to
it
for
fear
of
disfiguring
her
cheeks
with
brown
channels
if
he
saw
me
like
this
she
went
on
talking
to
herself
he
would
be
bound
to
repent
his
coldness
while
every
one
else
was
asleep
he
would
come
on
tiptoe
to
stand
by
my
bier
he
would
throw
himself
on
his
knees
and
cover
my
rigid
face
with
passionate
kisses
she
shuddered
the
from
the
inn
hearth
on
that
summer
evening
flickered
before
her
and
suppose
i
only
appeared
to
be
dead
and
was
really
she
went
on
or
that
his
newly
awakened
love
had
the
power
of
bringing
me
to
life
again
if
i
opened
my
eyes
and
stretched
out
my
arms
and
drew
him
to
me
in
full
forgiveness
and
as
she
instinctively
spread
out
those
forgiving
arms
she
felt
so
much
life
and
movement
in
her
that
the
illusion
of
being
dead
vanished
what
a
pity
she
thought
all
that
is
beautiful
passes
like
a
dream
she
set
to
work
at
once
to
remove
the
powder
from
her
face
with
a
handkerchief
rolled
into
a
ball
she
rubbed
and
scrubbed
cheeks
forehead
and
nose
and
the
harder
she
rubbed
the
greater
became
her
fear
that
she
might
not
be
able
to
wipe
off
all
traces
of
her
misdoing
her
heart
beat
loudly
she
seemed
to
herself
like
a
criminal
on
the
verge
of
being
discovered
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
corridor
she
let
the
handkerchief
fall
and
retired
to
the
most
shadowy
corner
of
the
room
behind
the
where
she
pretended
to
be
engrossed
in
the
study
of
a
picture
mamma
is
asleep
said
meta
coming
in
and
coffee
is
ready
oh
is
it
replied
hertha
in
confusion
she
would
have
given
worlds
to
be
able
to
stay
in
that
dark
corner
but
of
course
it
was
not
possible
on
the
way
to
the
she
gave
her
cheeks
a
few
more
vigorous
rubs
and
then
gallantly
faced
the
light
she
fancied
that
the
old
mamselle
who
greeted
her
with
a
smile
as
she
brought
in
the
coffee
was
mocking
at
her
secretly
and
when
meta
glance
rested
on
her
for
more
than
a
second
she
could
hold
out
no
longer
and
burying
her
hotly
blushing
face
on
her
shoulder
she
confessed
her
crime
meta
smiled
and
kissed
her
saying
never
mind
we
all
do
that
some
time
in
our
lives
you
too
asked
hertha
daring
to
breathe
freely
again
meta
nodded
and
as
mamma
going
off
to
sleep
had
put
her
in
a
more
cheerful
humour
she
added
the
confession
that
on
the
second
morning
of
her
wedded
life
she
had
hardly
had
the
patience
to
wait
for
hans
to
go
out
of
the
room
before
flouring
her
face
so
eager
had
she
been
to
operate
with
the
new
but
one
soon
gets
over
that
sort
of
thing
she
went
on
with
a
thoughtful
hard
look
in
her
eyes
now
the
ice
was
really
broken
and
when
the
apple
fritters
arrived
frizzling
crisply
in
their
juice
hertha
thought
the
atmosphere
was
favourable
for
her
great
question
still
she
struggled
twice
with
herself
before
she
was
sure
that
she
could
combine
the
right
moment
with
the
right
words
for
she
felt
that
her
friend
new
smile
did
not
mean
joking
there
one
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
she
began
in
a
careless
casual
sort
of
tone
though
there
was
a
choking
sensation
in
her
throat
wives
love
their
husbands
that
taken
for
granted
but
do
you
think
it
possible
that
wives
can
be
loved
by
men
men
who
are
not
their
husbands
her
friend
did
smile
this
time
but
laughed
outright
and
hertha
felt
a
stone
fall
from
her
heart
here
was
some
one
who
was
not
going
to
be
shocked
she
thought
how
funny
you
are
meta
said
no
one
can
prevent
people
loving
whom
they
choose
i
know
but
a
man
do
you
see
ought
not
no
he
not
but
often
does
does
any
one
else
love
then
meta
coloured
she
looked
into
space
perhaps
she
was
thinking
of
the
man
who
had
first
captured
her
maiden
fancy
i
do
ask
she
said
it
is
more
than
enough
that
i
please
hans
and
of
course
i
should
allow
anything
of
the
kind
then
it
is
allowed
of
course
not
when
they
tell
you
so
straight
out
what
do
they
ever
tell
it
often
it
happens
if
the
man
is
a
very
bold
lover
good
gracious
exclaimed
hertha
in
horror
if
such
a
thing
happened
to
me
i
should
show
him
the
door
pretty
quick
then
she
became
suddenly
silent
she
was
asking
herself
the
question
what
might
have
said
to
her
what
might
she
have
answered
would
it
be
possible
she
inquired
again
eagerly
for
there
to
be
women
who
who
would
mind
oh
yes
replied
meta
who
in
the
end
might
return
such
a
bold
man
love
yes
even
that
the
world
seemed
to
spin
round
in
hertha
brain
and
with
all
the
energy
of
innocence
she
cried
meta
i
wo
believe
it
there
is
a
good
deal
that
you
would
not
believe
that
i
now
know
to
be
facts
tell
me
tell
me
what
please
no
most
of
it
ca
be
told
said
her
friend
guardedly
not
to
any
one
at
least
who
is
not
married
hertha
thought
of
the
vow
they
had
once
exchanged
but
an
undefinable
feeling
of
shyness
stopped
her
from
reminding
the
forgetful
meta
of
it
all
i
can
tell
you
she
continued
is
that
things
are
very
different
from
what
we
girls
think
they
are
do
you
remember
for
instance
how
all
our
heads
were
turned
once
about
your
uncle
which
uncle
asked
hertha
leo
sellenthin
replied
meta
glancing
sideways
hertha
sighed
she
was
only
too
willing
to
forget
the
relationship
which
gave
him
authority
over
her
and
then
all
at
once
her
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
for
she
understood
that
the
next
minute
would
be
pregnant
for
her
with
revelation
she
was
to
hear
something
terrible
do
you
know
what
people
said
after
that
duel
when
he
shot
herr
von
rhaden
dead
no
she
murmured
they
said
that
he
and
felicitas
were
in
love
with
each
other
and
that
rhaden
found
it
out
good
heavens
what
is
the
matter
hertha
with
parted
lips
and
dilated
eyes
had
raised
her
hands
as
if
to
ward
off
the
blow
that
was
about
to
fall
on
her
for
goodness
sake
calm
yourself
cried
meta
stroking
her
face
with
both
hands
it
was
only
gossip
of
course
it
not
true
and
no
one
believes
it
now
why
is
it
not
true
because
if
it
were
ulrich
kletzingk
who
is
his
bosom
friend
and
knows
all
about
him
would
not
have
married
her
but
if
he
had
known
then
leo
would
have
confessed
it
to
him
before
the
marriage
but
suppose
he
had
not
confessed
he
would
have
been
absolutely
obliged
to
do
it
if
he
had
leo
would
have
behaved
shabbily
to
his
friend
hertha
scarcely
comprehended
but
one
thing
was
clear
and
flamed
like
a
torch
of
certainty
through
all
this
night
of
riddles
they
had
been
in
love
they
loved
each
other
still
they
would
always
love
each
other
after
this
she
was
indifferent
to
what
she
and
meta
talked
about
a
yellow
mist
lay
before
her
eyes
and
meta
voice
sounded
as
if
it
came
from
a
long
way
off
and
fell
on
her
ear
without
meaning
she
answered
not
knowing
what
she
answered
how
shall
i
get
away
she
kept
asking
herself
and
thought
with
horror
of
the
time
that
for
decency
sake
she
must
still
stay
but
her
deliverance
was
nearer
than
she
expected
although
the
manner
in
which
it
was
effected
filled
her
with
new
terror
meta
in
the
middle
of
her
chatter
turned
suddenly
pale
gasped
for
breath
and
then
tumbled
off
her
chair
in
a
dead
faint
hertha
rushed
to
her
with
a
cry
of
alarm
seized
the
and
poured
a
stream
of
water
on
her
face
meta
made
a
low
gurgling
sound
breathed
heavily
through
her
nose
and
then
came
to
herself
again
lord
have
mercy
cried
hertha
kissing
the
wet
forehead
of
the
reviving
girl
i
will
go
and
tell
them
to
send
for
the
doctor
at
once
but
her
friend
stopped
her
no
do
go
she
said
calmly
raising
herself
you
ca
understand
but
it
must
happen
to
be
married
is
like
being
in
another
world
thought
hertha
startled
where
fainting
dead
away
is
quite
an
everyday
event
then
she
reflected
how
gladly
she
would
have
fainted
a
hundred
times
a
day
for
the
sake
of
one
who
despised
and
spurned
her
i
will
go
home
at
once
you
ought
to
rest
she
murmured
controlling
her
excitement
with
difficulty
and
her
friend
did
not
press
her
to
stay
an
hour
later
when
she
appeared
in
the
at
halewitz
grandmamma
exclaimed
horrified
what
is
the
matter
with
you
child
you
are
as
pale
as
death
oh
it
nothing
grandmamma
she
replied
and
tried
to
laugh
i
have
been
such
a
goose
as
to
powder
myself
xxiv
evening
came
and
hertha
roamed
about
as
if
she
were
walking
in
her
sleep
when
the
bell
sounded
for
supper
she
felt
she
would
rather
creep
away
and
hide
somewhere
in
the
wainscot
than
face
him
but
in
her
perplexed
and
limp
condition
she
made
no
resistance
when
elly
came
to
drag
her
to
the
table
he
was
in
his
place
and
gave
her
a
friendly
nod
as
usual
but
his
smile
seemed
to
her
expressionless
and
stony
how
different
he
looked
to
her
eyes
from
what
he
had
ever
looked
before
if
fire
had
shot
out
of
his
mouth
she
would
have
hardly
been
surprised
he
seemed
now
to
be
really
the
demoniac
person
that
she
had
once
pictured
in
her
foolish
fancies
though
what
had
then
filled
her
with
longing
dreams
now
inspired
her
with
dread
and
horror
from
time
to
time
she
gave
him
a
shy
glance
how
can
any
one
sit
there
quietly
thought
she
concealing
such
awful
secrets
in
his
breast
he
had
become
very
silent
lately
grandmamma
gave
out
that
he
was
working
himself
to
death
the
grim
line
between
his
brows
seemed
to
grow
deeper
day
by
day
hertha
believed
now
that
she
knew
the
cause
of
that
line
she
almost
wished
it
might
kill
him
for
she
hated
him
and
the
sin
that
made
him
suffer
was
abhorrent
to
her
she
abhorred
herself
too
for
the
condition
of
hate
and
jealousy
into
which
she
had
worked
herself
up
seemed
to
her
undignified
and
vulgar
if
only
i
knew
what
i
ought
to
do
she
thought
so
that
i
need
be
ashamed
i
must
pray
she
concluded
finally
and
then
perhaps
i
shall
find
out
the
right
path
to
take
willingly
would
she
have
run
out
there
and
then
into
the
dark
garden
to
be
alone
with
god
but
the
rain
still
poured
down
in
torrents
at
elly
vexed
her
with
absurd
questions
about
what
one
should
do
if
a
lover
came
at
midnight
to
run
away
with
one
the
childish
chatter
of
her
bosom
friend
filled
her
with
mistrust
of
herself
perhaps
i
am
as
silly
as
she
is
she
mused
and
because
she
want
to
think
of
foolish
things
she
preferred
not
to
think
at
all
and
turned
on
her
side
and
fell
asleep
in
the
middle
of
the
night
she
woke
up
the
rain
seemed
to
have
left
off
but
a
gale
had
risen
which
rattled
the
shutters
and
whistled
and
moaned
through
the
keyholes
did
i
intend
to
pray
and
meditate
hertha
asked
as
she
settled
herself
snugly
amongst
the
pillows
she
felt
joyously
excited
at
having
cheated
sleep
for
even
her
troubles
could
not
do
more
than
increase
and
deepen
in
her
the
feeling
of
infinite
zest
in
mere
existence
she
folded
her
hands
but
could
not
compose
herself
to
pray
for
her
soul
was
whirled
and
tossed
on
the
wings
of
sublime
ideas
and
lofty
resolves
gradually
the
chaos
cleared
and
out
of
it
rose
in
triumphant
purity
one
solitary
resolution
she
would
renounce
renounce
all
dreams
of
happiness
all
hopes
renounce
all
the
empty
little
pleasures
with
which
thoughtlessly
she
had
been
wont
to
deck
her
youth
renounce
all
the
glittering
tinsel
of
worldliness
calm
and
noble
she
would
sacrifice
herself
to
her
neighbours
needs
death
at
her
heart
and
a
smile
on
her
lips
yes
so
it
should
be
and
shedding
tears
of
sweet
satisfaction
she
floated
into
the
realms
of
sleep
once
more
in
the
morning
when
she
opened
her
eyes
sunshine
greeted
them
what
had
passed
in
the
night
seemed
to
her
now
as
a
dream
a
miracle
worked
by
heaven
to
save
her
soul
from
despair
she
kissed
elly
with
redoubled
vigour
and
exhausted
herself
in
performing
little
services
for
others
for
this
harmonised
best
with
her
present
angelic
mood
only
during
breakfast
as
she
met
leo
eyes
was
she
conscious
of
the
bitterness
which
she
thought
she
had
conquered
for
ever
waking
in
her
again
this
recurrence
made
her
anxious
and
uneasy
my
resolution
is
too
weak
she
thought
to
be
able
to
withstand
the
temptations
of
the
world
i
must
strengthen
and
sanctify
it
by
a
solemn
vow
so
that
it
will
be
a
positive
sin
if
i
fail
again
nevertheless
though
she
racked
her
brains
she
could
devise
no
method
holy
and
awful
enough
to
endow
her
with
sufficient
power
of
resistance
at
last
in
a
flash
what
she
was
seeking
came
to
her
she
would
row
over
to
the
isle
of
friendship
the
home
of
all
gloomy
mysteries
there
before
the
sacrificial
stone
she
would
kneel
in
prayer
and
at
the
same
time
open
a
vein
of
her
arm
and
utter
a
vow
over
the
flowing
bloody
so
that
her
yearning
and
hate
might
be
silenced
for
ever
the
hours
went
by
in
sacred
expectation
soon
after
the
vesper
coffee
she
slipped
out
with
the
key
of
the
in
her
pocket
the
wind
swept
across
the
wide
meadow
flats
and
above
her
the
sun
was
half
hidden
by
a
ragged
fringe
of
stormy
clouds
the
grassy
path
had
been
saturated
by
the
rain
and
more
than
once
her
feet
stuck
fast
in
the
boggy
ground
which
oozed
and
gurgled
as
she
set
them
free
but
without
looking
back
she
hurried
on
like
a
phantasmagoria
the
rich
pastures
melted
behind
her
the
tall
sheaves
bent
before
the
wind
all
the
flowers
which
in
the
past
summer
days
had
made
so
fair
a
border
to
the
meadow
path
lay
on
the
ground
broken
and
smirched
in
a
liquid
as
she
came
in
sight
of
the
shining
surface
of
the
stream
stretching
into
the
distance
she
started
for
it
was
swollen
to
twice
its
usual
breadth
and
the
current
much
swifter
the
heavy
rains
of
the
last
few
days
were
responsible
the
boats
had
been
drawn
up
almost
on
to
the
top
of
the
dyke
and
water
was
hissing
from
the
foot
of
the
reeds
along
which
one
could
generally
walk
with
tolerably
dry
feet
it
was
uncanny
to
hear
the
dry
dark
heads
of
the
bulrushes
whipped
by
wind
and
wet
sighing
and
rattling
as
they
struck
against
each
other
for
a
moment
she
had
almost
a
mind
to
retire
from
the
foolhardy
enterprise
but
the
next
her
old
daring
defiance
took
possession
of
her
anew
if
i
am
in
earnest
about
my
vow
she
said
to
herself
no
bodily
danger
should
stand
in
my
way
she
loosened
the
chain
of
the
boat
which
slid
down
the
declivity
of
the
dyke
nearly
of
its
own
accord
in
the
she
found
the
right
oars
and
put
off
into
the
stream
now
a
desperate
struggle
began
even
before
she
had
got
clear
of
the
reeds
the
current
caught
the
little
craft
and
drove
it
into
the
thickest
part
of
the
sedge
so
that
the
keel
was
set
as
fast
on
unbroken
rushes
as
on
a
sandbank
here
it
was
impossible
to
strike
out
with
the
oars
and
only
by
pushing
herself
off
with
her
hands
from
one
clump
of
bulrushes
to
another
did
she
at
length
get
into
open
water
the
boat
was
instantly
caught
by
a
couple
of
eddies
and
spun
round
in
a
circle
clenching
her
teeth
hertha
steered
herself
with
the
handle
of
the
oar
her
chest
expanded
the
blood
hammered
in
her
veins
a
feverish
vapour
swam
before
her
eyes
with
every
stroke
of
the
oars
she
felt
a
portion
of
her
life
strength
flow
out
but
what
did
it
matter
the
boat
was
being
mastered
it
was
making
progress
and
by
degrees
the
tumult
in
her
blood
subsided
the
muscles
instead
of
slackening
became
hard
as
steel
she
dared
look
round
and
measure
the
distance
she
had
come
the
isle
of
friendship
greeted
her
with
its
masses
of
foliage
from
which
whirled
swarms
of
falling
leaves
a
cry
of
hopeful
longing
escaped
her
breast
but
she
must
look
out
or
another
eddy
would
catch
the
boat
ten
minutes
might
have
passed
when
two
withered
leaves
fluttered
over
her
head
and
sank
like
tired
birds
of
passage
swimming
on
to
the
water
she
gave
a
deep
sigh
of
satisfaction
for
she
knew
that
these
leaves
were
envoys
that
the
isle
of
friendship
had
sent
to
meet
her
and
now
when
she
looked
round
she
found
that
she
was
within
the
shadow
of
its
willows
one
more
bitter
fight
with
the
current
and
with
a
last
stroke
of
the
oars
she
shot
into
the
little
bay
whose
sandy
was
quite
under
water
so
that
the
boat
was
able
to
drift
right
in
amongst
the
alder
roots
with
a
rapid
movement
she
slung
the
chain
round
the
strongest
of
the
stumps
fastened
it
firmly
and
swung
herself
by
clinging
to
an
overhanging
branch
on
to
the
steep
slippery
bank
for
a
moment
she
crouched
down
on
the
drenched
grass
to
recover
breath
and
looked
at
her
blistered
palms
which
were
bleeding
she
wiped
the
blood
away
with
her
tongue
and
laughed
then
she
threw
a
frightened
glance
into
the
thicket
where
ruddy
sunlight
lay
on
the
yellow
leaves
the
brook
which
ran
down
to
the
river
tossed
dirty
grey
rainwater
over
the
slimy
stones
between
which
were
heaped
stacks
of
dead
damp
leaves
the
tongues
of
fern
growing
along
the
edge
of
the
water
were
nipped
and
shrivelled
up
and
they
looked
as
they
stood
there
like
little
wrinkled
old
women
in
their
blurred
brown
rags
not
far
off
were
a
greasy
company
of
toadstools
spreading
their
smooth
heads
delicately
fluted
underneath
they
shone
as
if
they
had
been
rolling
in
butter
in
disgust
at
these
rotting
excrescences
of
damp
weather
hertha
strode
over
them
and
struck
into
the
thick
of
the
thorny
shrubs
which
sorely
thwarted
her
progress
everywhere
brambles
hung
with
raindrops
like
chains
of
pearls
switched
her
in
the
face
and
her
footmarks
on
the
swampy
moss
into
which
she
sank
became
glittering
pools
as
she
walked
on
it
was
a
path
along
which
the
enchanted
princesses
of
fairy
tale
might
have
wandered
but
she
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
and
when
she
saw
a
cluster
of
sloeberries
glistening
at
her
feet
she
stooped
and
gathered
them
carefully
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
at
last
the
clearing
lay
before
her
bathed
in
the
purple
rays
of
the
sinking
sun
she
paused
filled
with
reverent
awe
and
looked
round
her
the
evening
shadows
had
gathered
over
the
little
temple
and
the
branches
scattered
upon
it
their
burden
of
fading
leaves
there
was
a
sighing
and
moaning
in
the
air
as
if
the
whole
army
of
spirits
with
whom
the
legends
of
the
neighbourhood
populated
the
wood
were
assembled
on
this
very
spot
and
there
on
the
edge
of
the
boscage
was
the
old
sacrificial
stone
standing
like
an
altar
ready
for
a
new
offering
of
blood
a
cold
shiver
began
to
creep
over
her
but
she
suppressed
it
quickly
let
those
who
were
cowards
or
who
had
guilty
consciences
be
afraid
she
stood
still
in
front
of
the
temple
of
friendship
and
gazed
up
in
astonishment
at
the
sandstone
figures
which
of
the
two
is
meant
for
leo
she
wondered
and
for
the
first
time
she
fully
realised
the
great
wrong
which
was
being
done
the
man
called
ulrich
the
thought
made
her
uneasy
and
the
longer
she
dwelt
on
it
the
blacker
were
the
depths
of
depravity
that
it
seemed
to
reach
she
turned
her
back
for
she
could
no
longer
bear
the
sight
of
the
two
friends
with
their
arms
twined
round
each
other
one
is
a
liar
she
murmured
to
herself
and
she
felt
just
then
as
if
all
truth
and
good
faith
had
vanished
from
the
world
as
if
even
yonder
sun
was
a
monstrous
lie
no
no
she
thought
further
it
is
impossible
he
must
have
told
him
and
have
said
love
your
wife
but
it
is
of
no
consequence
i
only
want
to
see
her
now
and
then
and
listen
to
her
voice
nothing
more
of
course
that
was
how
it
was
it
could
simply
could
be
otherwise
and
she
herself
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
see
sometimes
and
to
win
a
friendly
word
from
him
truly
she
had
wanted
more
once
she
had
wanted
to
marry
him
at
least
a
short
time
ago
she
had
but
now
of
course
that
was
all
over
and
done
with
she
had
renounced
him
her
heart
swelled
she
ran
round
the
old
stone
several
times
then
sat
down
on
top
of
it
and
cried
bitterly
as
she
folded
her
hands
to
pray
she
saw
the
blood
gushing
forth
how
stupid
i
was
this
morning
she
thought
when
i
thought
that
i
should
have
to
open
one
of
my
veins
on
this
stone
as
if
i
could
pour
out
my
heart
blood
for
him
without
doing
that
and
tucking
her
feet
beneath
her
body
she
began
to
pray
out
loud
while
the
tears
rolled
into
her
mouth
dear
god
it
is
all
over
now
my
hopes
and
my
happiness
are
wrecked
therefore
i
beseech
thee
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
to
give
me
strength
at
least
to
make
others
happy
and
if
i
renounce
let
me
do
so
without
envy
anger
or
bitterness
endow
me
with
that
true
christian
humility
and
gentleness
that
elly
has
in
such
a
high
degree
so
that
i
may
curb
my
dreadfully
hot
temper
and
not
say
horrid
things
to
those
i
love
and
above
all
i
pray
thee
for
one
thing
if
he
loves
her
spare
him
the
endless
suffering
that
i
endure
because
of
him
let
him
be
as
happy
as
it
is
possible
for
him
to
be
in
his
unhappy
love
and
especially
guard
him
from
playing
the
liar
to
ulrich
so
that
i
need
not
be
ashamed
unto
death
for
him
take
frau
felicitas
too
under
your
protection
and
let
all
men
whether
they
be
good
or
bad
enjoy
thy
grace
so
that
at
last
they
shall
all
come
to
eternal
bliss
amen
she
repeated
the
amen
three
times
and
asked
herself
if
there
was
any
enemy
or
for
whom
she
had
forgotten
to
pray
but
none
occurred
to
her
her
heart
was
now
so
overflowing
with
love
and
forgiveness
that
she
did
know
how
she
could
be
thankful
enough
the
sun
had
gone
down
a
last
red
glow
of
light
touched
the
corners
of
the
temple
and
gilded
the
autumn
clouds
that
gathered
in
threatening
masses
on
the
horizon
hertha
climbed
down
from
the
stone
ate
the
blackberries
which
she
had
put
down
beside
her
and
thought
of
her
journey
home
with
some
anxiety
a
bird
of
prey
flew
across
the
river
with
a
thundering
flap
of
its
wings
and
then
soared
as
straight
as
a
dart
towards
the
clouds
its
plumage
seemed
to
flash
the
wind
shook
the
grasses
all
at
once
it
grew
dark
farewell
said
hertha
looking
back
at
the
pair
of
friends
come
again
in
the
spring
suddenly
she
started
in
terror
she
heard
a
crackling
and
snapping
of
twigs
among
the
bushes
which
drew
nearer
and
nearer
a
robber
thought
hertha
and
laid
her
hand
on
her
beating
heart
erect
she
stood
there
turning
a
courageous
face
to
the
approaching
danger
the
figure
of
a
man
came
in
view
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
hertha
felt
her
blood
run
cold
it
was
leo
he
hurried
towards
her
with
his
firm
stride
the
veins
stood
out
on
his
forehead
his
eyes
flashed
fire
what
are
you
doing
here
he
demanded
she
was
silent
and
bit
her
lips
feeling
all
her
meekness
depart
at
one
blow
have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses
did
i
forbid
you
to
row
here
alone
and
the
stream
swollen
too
hertha
began
to
boil
inwardly
was
this
the
reward
of
her
renunciation
but
have
patience
be
silent
a
voice
cried
within
her
it
a
marvel
that
you
have
been
carried
away
he
scolded
on
all
his
anxiety
for
her
turning
into
wrath
when
i
forbid
a
thing
i
have
my
reasons
for
doing
so
but
the
devil
himself
seems
to
drive
you
into
disobedience
girl
i
am
not
at
all
inclined
to
go
on
a
chase
after
you
again
i
can
tell
you
ah
that
was
hard
he
scorned
that
hour
which
lived
in
her
memory
as
the
most
sacred
she
had
known
it
was
more
than
hard
it
was
brutal
at
this
moment
she
hated
him
so
that
she
felt
as
if
she
was
almost
swooning
from
the
intensity
of
her
emotions
all
all
that
she
had
just
sworn
was
forgotten
and
with
a
smile
of
icy
contempt
hardly
knowing
what
she
said
she
answered
you
can
order
and
forbid
as
much
as
you
like
but
he
who
is
not
honest
and
does
not
keep
his
word
himself
can
scarcely
expect
that
others
will
respect
and
obey
him
the
words
were
spoken
they
could
not
be
recalled
reeling
a
step
forwards
he
stared
at
her
dully
what
what
does
that
mean
every
drop
of
blood
had
forsaken
his
face
you
must
know
perfectly
well
what
it
means
and
she
turned
to
go
he
would
have
liked
to
shake
her
to
question
her
and
force
her
to
speak
but
he
had
not
the
courage
it
seemed
to
him
that
from
the
lips
of
this
child
he
had
been
condemned
in
silence
they
walked
to
the
in
silence
he
rowed
her
over
the
stream
in
silence
they
parted
two
who
because
they
belonged
to
each
other
determined
to
go
through
life
as
enemies
xxv
the
reconciliation
of
the
two
women
removed
the
last
obstacle
that
stood
in
the
way
of
leo
resuming
his
old
relations
with
his
friend
nevertheless
things
remained
as
they
were
leo
did
his
utmost
to
deceive
himself
and
yet
every
fresh
meeting
afforded
him
little
else
but
anxiety
and
nervous
oppression
of
spirit
when
he
searched
his
heart
honestly
he
could
not
wonder
that
it
was
so
formerly
when
he
had
reviewed
his
position
with
an
untroubled
glance
he
had
taken
for
granted
that
the
ghost
of
the
past
should
stand
between
him
and
his
friend
unless
the
whole
naked
shameless
truth
should
be
brought
to
the
light
of
day
and
confessed
but
that
such
a
confession
would
be
an
impossible
villainy
seemed
equally
to
be
taken
for
granted
so
there
thus
remained
no
other
choice
but
to
perpetrate
a
not
less
grave
though
less
ruinous
villainy
to
act
a
lie
the
same
crooked
cringing
smiling
lie
day
after
day
in
the
house
of
the
unsuspecting
man
and
to
betray
the
master
and
at
every
afresh
to
keep
away
now
was
out
of
the
question
he
could
in
no
way
have
justified
such
a
course
in
these
short
and
rainy
autumn
days
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
avoid
felicitas
and
he
was
obliged
to
own
to
himself
that
he
no
longer
wished
to
avoid
her
those
understanding
looks
which
one
hour
he
abhorred
consoled
him
the
next
for
they
were
eloquent
of
sympathy
and
gratitude
he
would
even
have
liked
to
be
oftener
alone
with
her
for
although
such
interviews
meant
an
amalgam
of
shame
remorse
slackness
and
cynicism
they
necessitated
no
lying
one
spoke
the
truth
without
restraint
however
abominable
the
subject
one
talked
on
might
be
but
what
was
worst
of
all
was
the
uncertainty
about
ulrich
attitude
towards
him
for
a
long
time
he
had
not
been
sure
how
to
interpret
it
he
kept
vigilant
watch
on
his
friend
expression
as
if
to
ascertain
whether
he
had
guessed
anything
since
they
last
met
and
so
the
flow
of
easy
and
natural
converse
dried
up
in
his
throat
whatever
he
did
he
was
tormented
by
the
probability
of
ulrich
having
gathered
from
his
intercourse
with
felicitas
some
hint
that
roused
his
suspicions
he
might
by
the
process
of
putting
two
and
two
together
and
by
recalling
and
comparing
incidents
be
drawing
conclusions
and
nearing
the
discovery
of
the
hideous
truth
so
absorbed
was
he
by
the
idea
that
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
almost
inconceivable
that
ulrich
should
not
have
drawn
such
conclusions
and
there
were
certain
hours
when
he
firmly
believed
that
his
friend
geniality
was
a
mere
mask
which
he
assumed
to
draw
him
into
a
trap
he
measured
anxiously
the
warmth
of
each
with
which
ulrich
welcomed
him
and
if
he
noticed
that
his
eyes
were
resting
on
him
thoughtfully
his
blood
would
mount
hotly
to
his
brow
and
the
figure
of
his
friend
swim
before
him
in
a
mist
one
evening
in
the
middle
of
october
ulrich
received
him
at
the
portico
with
the
words
come
into
my
study
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
the
tone
in
which
he
said
this
was
one
of
suspicious
solemnity
and
leo
felt
his
heart
sink
he
was
almost
convinced
now
that
the
hour
of
explanation
had
sounded
i
put
a
bullet
through
my
brain
before
i
confess
he
thought
while
ulrich
closed
the
door
behind
them
his
furtive
gaze
wandered
searchingly
along
the
massive
black
shelves
and
cupboards
which
lined
the
small
room
and
from
which
the
gold
of
the
bookbindings
cast
a
soft
shimmer
here
amidst
periodicals
and
political
pamphlets
microscopes
and
specimens
his
friend
spent
his
leisure
here
he
robbed
his
nights
of
sleep
in
ceaseless
and
indefatigable
study
leo
felt
as
if
he
must
make
sure
of
a
weapon
but
in
this
peaceful
little
kingdom
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
in
evidence
silently
he
sat
down
and
confronted
his
friend
with
mute
hostility
ulrich
long
figure
dropped
into
the
black
chair
at
the
and
he
pushed
the
lamp
with
green
shade
out
of
the
circuit
of
his
elbow
now
listen
he
began
the
question
that
i
am
going
to
ask
has
become
unavoidable
for
we
ca
go
on
like
this
something
is
wrong
with
you
no
do
contradict
me
we
have
known
each
other
as
long
as
we
can
remember
but
i
have
never
seen
you
like
this
before
leo
choked
back
his
answer
with
a
hoarse
laugh
shall
i
enumerate
all
the
changes
in
you
on
my
fingers
continued
ulrich
i
think
it
is
hardly
necessary
at
all
events
you
are
concealing
something
from
me
and
i
have
been
wondering
for
a
long
time
what
it
can
be
i
have
made
a
note
of
every
possibility
and
weighed
each
according
to
a
strictly
logical
system
i
have
weeded
out
the
most
nonsensical
and
now
two
eventualities
have
remained
the
first
is
need
of
money
leo
would
have
hastily
agreed
so
as
to
leave
no
room
for
the
second
supposition
but
he
foresaw
what
the
consequences
would
be
and
was
silent
ulrich
eyes
rested
on
him
in
burning
solicitude
he
tugged
at
his
thin
beard
awaiting
an
answer
shook
his
head
and
then
continued
but
i
say
to
myself
that
my
comrade
of
old
would
never
let
himself
be
depressed
by
such
cares
and
besides
it
would
be
a
breach
of
faith
of
the
worst
sort
if
he
was
uneasy
for
a
minute
about
money
so
long
as
my
contains
in
it
an
unwritten
page
true
i
hope
that
you
would
never
do
me
such
a
wrong
no
no
exclaimed
leo
and
looked
as
if
he
were
about
to
seize
his
friend
hand
but
his
courage
failed
him
you
swear
it
yes
of
course
i
swear
it
he
replied
one
falsehood
more
or
less
signified
little
now
he
knew
that
he
would
rather
cut
off
his
right
hand
than
take
a
single
farthing
from
the
hand
that
now
lay
cold
and
gentle
in
his
and
then
i
say
to
myself
went
on
ulrich
a
man
who
was
born
to
laugh
and
be
merry
does
become
moody
and
despondent
for
nothing
if
it
not
debts
that
prey
on
him
it
is
guilt
leo
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
and
withdrew
it
damp
and
what
may
the
guilt
be
he
asked
trying
to
laugh
yes
i
have
asked
myself
that
question
too
what
can
it
be
when
he
is
afraid
to
speak
of
it
to
me
and
i
have
argued
further
it
must
be
something
that
he
fears
to
pain
me
by
confessing
otherwise
his
silence
would
have
no
motive
it
must
be
therefore
something
in
which
i
am
myself
concerned
leo
half
risen
clung
to
the
arms
of
his
chair
he
was
extremely
upset
i
am
as
transparent
as
glass
to
him
he
thought
only
friendly
almost
mournful
calmness
still
remained
a
riddle
to
him
and
this
calmness
restrained
him
else
would
he
have
sought
before
to
save
himself
from
what
was
coming
i
set
myself
the
task
of
inquiring
into
the
past
ulrich
continued
i
ransacked
your
life
back
to
its
earliest
youth
i
found
scrapes
and
even
intrigues
in
plenty
but
of
actual
nothing
till
up
to
what
your
duel
with
rhaden
leo
felt
a
sensation
of
something
to
which
he
had
been
clinging
giving
way
within
him
with
a
tired
sigh
he
sank
against
the
back
of
the
chair
ulrich
leaned
over
and
put
his
hand
on
his
knee
do
try
to
hide
it
from
me
any
more
he
said
i
see
too
plainly
that
i
have
hit
the
mark
you
would
be
made
of
stone
and
iron
if
the
sight
of
her
who
was
once
his
wife
did
not
perpetually
remind
you
of
the
fact
that
it
is
no
light
or
ordinary
matter
to
shoot
down
like
a
wild
beast
some
one
who
has
injured
our
or
to
let
ourselves
be
so
shot
down
what
could
i
do
stammered
leo
again
without
a
conception
of
what
his
friend
was
driving
at
a
reconciliation
ought
to
have
been
patched
up
that
is
to
say
misunderstand
me
i
am
not
blaming
you
it
would
not
become
me
to
do
so
as
i
myself
was
more
to
blame
than
you
to
blame
undoubtedly
i
was
the
mediator
i
should
also
have
been
the
peacemaker
and
to
this
day
it
a
mystery
to
me
that
i
could
manage
to
avert
the
consequences
of
that
foolish
dispute
i
made
bad
use
of
my
official
opportunity
rhaden
should
have
been
compelled
to
recall
the
expression
for
it
clear
that
he
only
let
it
escape
him
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
i
have
judged
myself
severely
enough
i
will
confess
to
you
that
i
ask
myself
sometimes
you
justified
in
marrying
the
wife
of
a
man
in
whose
death
you
had
a
hand
scruples
perhaps
of
a
somewhat
pedantic
conscience
and
only
you
have
the
right
to
reproach
me
for
it
reproach
i
exclaimed
leo
who
at
last
slowly
grasped
that
this
abstruse
dreamer
with
his
punctilious
sense
of
justice
was
trying
to
fasten
on
himself
a
guilty
responsibility
out
of
his
altogether
version
of
the
facts
ah
if
he
only
knew
yes
my
dear
boy
uhich
went
on
do
conceal
from
me
what
you
think
of
my
conduct
from
false
sentiments
i
am
guilty
and
i
alone
this
house
should
be
as
much
your
home
as
halewitz
and
i
ought
not
to
have
allowed
even
the
most
insane
love
to
prevail
upon
me
to
bring
a
wife
here
who
would
so
constantly
remind
you
of
that
untoward
event
not
that
she
knows
or
wishes
it
for
she
has
so
thoroughly
forgiven
you
that
sometimes
i
wonder
how
such
a
power
of
forgiving
and
forgetting
can
exist
on
earth
it
appears
to
me
like
unfaithfulness
to
the
father
of
her
child
and
above
all
a
faint
flush
passed
over
his
face
and
he
turned
away
to
master
his
emotion
above
all
it
seems
a
wrong
to
the
child
himself
you
see
that
all
this
brooding
reflection
has
made
me
both
bitter
and
unjust
for
after
all
i
am
only
reproaching
her
with
her
devotion
to
me
and
her
desire
to
promote
my
happiness
alone
through
the
completeness
of
her
pardon
has
it
been
possible
for
me
to
stand
before
you
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
traitor
to
our
friendship
although
god
knows
i
have
enough
for
which
to
claim
your
forbearance
ulrich
i
ca
stand
this
cried
leo
jumping
to
his
feet
what
ca
you
stand
replied
the
other
in
the
tolerant
considerate
tone
in
which
people
speak
to
impetuous
headstrong
children
my
willingness
to
take
half
the
burden
of
your
trouble
on
my
own
shoulders
i
tell
you
it
belongs
to
me
old
boy
it
is
my
privilege
and
i
demand
it
and
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
rendering
accounts
in
friendship
i
would
say
that
i
stand
so
deep
in
your
debt
that
i
see
how
a
tolerable
balance
can
ever
be
restored
do
snort
and
stride
about
the
room
at
that
mad
pace
you
know
i
hate
it
there
now
drop
all
superfluous
considerations
out
of
regard
for
me
and
be
open
with
me
in
future
we
two
get
on
best
when
we
tell
each
other
everything
even
when
it
hurts
anything
better
than
sparing
each
other
feelings
by
setting
up
a
barrier
of
shy
reserve
leo
made
an
inarticulate
exclamation
and
stood
in
front
of
his
friend
with
his
shoulders
squared
at
that
moment
he
resolved
to
tell
all
a
hunger
for
truth
worked
so
powerfully
in
his
soul
that
he
would
have
thought
it
cheaply
purchased
at
the
price
of
death
itself
but
almost
immediately
after
a
voice
cried
within
him
it
would
be
madness
and
it
may
lead
to
murder
so
he
fell
back
silently
into
his
armchair
the
twilight
which
reigned
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
prevented
his
agitation
from
being
visible
otherwise
it
must
have
betrayed
him
and
one
thing
more
my
boy
ulrich
went
on
again
for
a
long
time
i
have
had
something
to
thank
you
for
which
has
been
weighing
heavily
on
my
mind
still
thanking
me
thought
leo
with
an
outbreak
of
unholy
humour
which
was
next
door
to
despair
you
ought
to
know
it
because
i
am
sure
that
it
will
give
you
pleasure
you
have
been
the
good
angel
of
my
house
no
do
deny
it
it
a
fact
it
looks
as
if
you
know
devilish
well
how
to
manage
women
then
it
is
almost
incredible
how
felicitas
has
changed
for
the
better
since
you
have
been
coming
here
frequently
you
would
not
look
at
me
in
such
astonishment
if
you
knew
what
she
had
been
before
all
that
folly
with
the
boys
of
the
neighbourhood
is
past
and
over
not
long
ago
i
referred
to
it
in
joke
and
she
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
implored
me
with
tears
in
her
eyes
never
to
speak
of
it
she
lives
a
domestic
life
and
tries
to
interest
and
busy
herself
in
the
house
her
fantastic
vagaries
have
entirely
vanished
she
has
given
up
crying
for
no
cause
she
is
much
more
composed
and
dignified
in
her
views
and
does
live
now
on
nothing
but
marmalade
and
madeira
and
what
is
my
chief
solace
of
all
i
wo
keep
it
from
you
for
you
will
rejoice
in
her
happiness
knowing
how
unhappy
i
was
she
no
longer
locks
my
door
a
spasm
of
repulsion
shot
through
leo
breast
which
he
attributed
to
shame
at
this
undeserved
confidence
and
tried
to
combat
then
something
like
a
genuine
feeling
of
happiness
dawned
in
his
soul
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
pressed
his
friend
hand
after
all
there
had
been
no
foundation
for
his
anxiety
while
he
had
been
suffering
and
wrestling
with
himself
his
object
unknown
to
himself
had
been
fulfilled
perhaps
things
were
not
so
bad
as
they
had
seemed
perhaps
there
was
still
hope
even
for
him
too
xxvi
the
soothing
effect
of
this
conversation
lasted
several
days
and
then
went
off
completely
his
friend
blind
trust
became
torture
to
him
much
as
he
had
feared
his
suspicion
now
an
atom
of
uncertainty
would
have
seemed
a
positive
consolation
and
have
placed
his
crime
within
the
range
of
human
possibilities
amongst
the
premises
which
ulrich
according
to
his
own
words
had
rejected
as
untenable
leo
love
for
felicitas
had
in
all
probability
found
a
place
his
friend
could
not
easily
have
overlooked
it
in
his
logical
inquiry
but
the
pure
nobility
of
his
unsuspicious
heart
had
at
once
annihilated
the
evidence
which
his
acutely
reasoning
mind
had
built
up
there
were
moments
when
he
could
almost
have
hated
him
for
this
had
ulrich
been
more
mistrustful
before
his
marriage
the
whole
business
might
have
turned
out
differently
the
more
he
thought
over
the
change
in
lizzie
and
the
new
relations
with
her
which
at
first
had
promised
so
happily
the
more
disquieted
he
became
inwardly
if
it
was
true
that
she
no
longer
cared
for
him
how
was
the
powerful
influence
that
he
exercised
over
her
to
be
accounted
for
he
dared
not
follow
the
line
of
argument
further
but
his
thoughts
hovered
about
the
dangerous
ground
as
wild
beasts
prowl
round
a
his
only
comfort
in
these
troubles
was
the
management
of
the
estate
he
felt
that
if
there
was
any
salvation
for
him
he
must
find
it
in
work
he
would
work
till
all
his
muscles
relaxed
and
he
came
near
door
and
of
work
to
be
done
there
was
enough
in
all
conscience
october
is
a
heavy
month
in
the
districts
where
is
cultivated
the
process
of
harvest
demands
the
severest
vigilance
for
the
labourers
in
order
to
make
more
rapid
progress
are
fond
of
tearing
the
roots
out
of
the
ground
and
freeing
them
of
the
clinging
earth
by
beating
them
violently
together
two
cardinal
errors
because
the
slightest
flaw
in
the
root
lowers
its
value
the
next
stage
of
moving
the
crop
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
nearest
export
station
is
attended
with
even
more
labour
and
trouble
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
long
before
the
first
gleam
of
dawn
had
crept
across
the
level
landscape
what
had
been
dug
out
of
the
earth
the
day
before
was
smartened
up
and
piled
on
to
the
waggons
which
in
slow
procession
journeyed
to
münsterberg
where
the
were
packed
for
the
railway
transit
it
was
a
long
and
difficult
route
especially
the
crossing
of
the
river
was
apt
to
involve
a
thousand
delays
and
mishaps
whereby
much
precious
time
was
lost
and
leo
did
not
shirk
the
arduous
task
of
superintending
the
transit
in
person
a
task
which
the
most
conscientious
of
bailiffs
would
willingly
have
shunted
on
to
the
shoulders
of
others
so
there
was
much
jeering
astonishment
in
the
district
at
the
spectacle
of
a
landed
proprietor
appearing
on
the
scene
before
six
in
the
morning
those
were
fine
strenuous
days
with
a
satisfying
record
of
countless
duties
achieved
at
five
minutes
to
three
the
watchman
pole
tapped
on
his
a
dreadful
moment
but
how
could
it
be
helped
on
the
stroke
of
three
the
shutters
must
be
opened
as
a
sign
to
the
watchman
that
he
was
up
otherwise
that
official
had
orders
to
hunt
his
master
out
of
bed
with
a
douche
of
cold
water
twenty
minutes
later
he
was
in
the
saddle
night
and
silence
still
reigned
in
the
castle
only
christian
who
despite
the
burden
of
years
would
not
relinquish
the
service
of
himself
mixing
the
gnädiger
herr
warm
cognac
stood
with
lamp
and
taper
in
the
doorway
and
greeted
him
with
a
tremulous
good
morning
then
followed
a
smart
gallop
to
the
fields
where
the
already
nervously
awaited
him
their
lanterns
flashing
out
of
the
darkness
showed
him
the
way
a
sonorous
morning
greeting
returned
by
a
chorus
of
voices
a
rapid
survey
of
the
waggons
a
few
in
addition
for
in
german
country
places
no
workman
feels
at
home
unless
he
is
sworn
at
and
then
amidst
a
tremendous
din
the
procession
of
waggons
heavily
but
withal
adroitly
got
under
way
half
an
hour
later
they
drew
up
at
the
wengern
ferry
the
black
river
lay
there
in
the
darkness
yawning
and
gurgling
like
a
huge
monster
gifted
with
invisible
and
destructive
life
over
it
the
wind
whistled
and
sighed
although
not
a
twig
stirred
on
the
plains
the
oscillated
the
horses
neighed
anxiously
confused
cries
and
words
of
command
rang
out
through
the
air
the
heavily
loaded
waggons
rumbled
amidst
the
cracking
of
whips
and
rattling
harness
down
the
precipitous
decline
of
the
dyke
as
if
they
were
bound
to
roll
headlong
into
the
abyss
they
got
on
to
the
shaking
where
the
bar
brought
the
horses
to
a
halt
and
these
swerved
to
one
side
in
their
nervousness
and
tried
to
bite
each
other
flanks
the
ferry
could
take
ten
at
a
time
the
rest
had
to
wait
for
the
second
journey
a
curious
feeling
of
panic
seized
leo
every
time
the
rope
slackened
and
the
pulleys
began
to
work
he
rode
up
and
down
the
bank
and
watched
the
fleet
embark
it
seemed
to
glide
into
space
and
was
swallowed
up
in
darkness
only
the
reflection
of
the
lanterns
made
trembling
threads
of
light
across
the
black
water
on
the
other
side
of
the
ferry
the
train
divided
for
it
would
have
been
a
waste
of
time
for
the
first
relay
to
await
the
second
when
the
last
waggon
had
crossed
leo
enjoyment
began
he
loosened
the
curb
in
order
to
gallop
the
quicker
after
the
receding
carts
his
limbs
numb
from
cold
or
wet
thawed
a
tingling
sensation
of
welcome
warmth
pervaded
his
body
and
winged
his
thoughts
so
long
as
the
race
lasted
all
trouble
was
forgotten
the
early
morning
cramp
of
worry
a
symptom
which
once
had
been
unknown
to
his
robust
physique
grew
less
and
finally
disappeared
the
first
suggestion
of
light
that
lay
on
the
earth
dreamy
and
full
of
promise
found
for
a
few
moments
a
reflection
in
his
soul
with
the
rosy
dawn
the
first
waggon
made
its
entry
into
münsterberg
and
drew
up
at
the
station
shed
near
which
was
the
great
pair
of
scales
a
tedious
hour
of
wrangling
and
counting
followed
then
he
turned
his
face
towards
home
and
in
the
castle
when
grandmamma
called
the
children
to
coffee
leo
made
his
appearance
too
sometimes
he
was
covered
with
dust
sometimes
drenched
with
rain
with
clattering
of
spurs
and
amidst
barking
of
dogs
he
would
come
into
the
room
and
with
a
weary
good
morning
hurl
his
cap
into
a
corner
his
day
work
only
began
now
in
earnest
and
when
he
entered
his
bedroom
at
night
he
dropped
into
a
chair
as
if
felled
by
a
sudden
blow
often
he
could
scarcely
find
the
strength
to
undress
and
two
or
three
times
the
pitiless
pole
had
tapped
and
surprised
him
still
sitting
at
his
table
with
flushed
face
and
smoking
lamp
there
was
little
time
left
for
visits
to
uhlenfelde
and
leo
felt
happy
at
having
a
valid
pretext
for
excusing
himself
yet
it
seemed
to
him
scarcely
right
to
avoid
meeting
felicitas
alone
she
might
ask
why
he
had
been
untrue
to
his
word
she
had
a
certain
claim
to
his
society
and
he
began
too
to
be
devoured
with
a
longing
to
see
and
converse
with
her
without
ulrich
being
present
he
hoped
for
a
favourable
opportunity
such
as
the
last
had
been
but
it
did
not
occur
so
he
counted
with
a
beating
heart
the
hours
till
he
should
be
certain
of
ulrich
absence
and
meanwhile
he
stayed
at
home
then
came
an
evening
when
the
representatives
of
the
agricultural
association
were
holding
their
monthly
meeting
in
münsterberg
and
he
no
longer
able
to
restrain
himself
started
with
a
kind
of
sad
defiance
for
uhlenfelde
it
was
dark
when
he
landed
on
the
opposite
bank
the
wind
was
boisterous
and
cold
and
he
felt
half
frozen
old
minna
met
him
in
the
vestibule
the
factotum
of
the
old
love
intrigue
whose
mediating
offices
he
recalled
with
a
shudder
she
explained
to
him
blinking
and
nodding
that
the
gracious
little
mistress
was
well
that
the
gracious
little
mistress
was
suffering
from
cramp
of
the
heart
but
nevertheless
the
gracious
one
would
receive
him
the
familiarity
with
which
the
toothless
clapping
mouth
smirked
up
at
him
was
revolting
and
still
more
revolting
was
it
that
he
found
himself
smiling
back
at
her
but
it
was
necessary
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
her
was
she
not
an
accomplice
shuddering
he
hardly
knew
whether
from
cold
or
excitement
he
paced
up
and
down
between
the
pillars
it
was
some
time
before
the
old
hag
returned
the
gracious
little
mistress
had
been
lying
down
but
begged
him
to
wait
a
few
minutes
she
would
make
her
toilette
as
quickly
as
possible
that
was
to
say
not
completely
because
such
old
friends
need
stand
on
ceremony
with
each
other
leo
compressed
his
lips
had
she
chosen
to
be
more
explicit
still
he
must
have
endured
it
in
lizzie
sanctum
two
lamps
with
shades
were
burning
cushions
and
rugs
were
scattered
about
in
confusion
on
the
couch
as
if
some
one
had
a
moment
before
disturbed
them
by
hastily
jumping
up
an
open
book
lay
face
downwards
on
the
carpet
he
picked
it
up
the
title
was
the
golden
road
to
virtue
experiences
of
a
sinner
he
began
to
turn
over
the
leaves
haphazard
in
the
highly
coloured
style
of
a
tract
a
newly
converted
sinner
related
her
marvellous
rescue
from
vice
with
a
sort
of
coquettish
fervour
which
made
him
fancy
he
saw
the
play
of
uplifted
eyes
with
which
this
magdalene
sought
to
lure
the
saviour
like
another
lover
into
her
net
but
from
leo
the
goth
who
since
his
had
read
the
very
worst
literature
even
such
trash
as
this
wrung
a
certain
unwilling
respect
she
is
doing
her
best
according
to
her
lights
he
thought
and
laid
the
book
down
with
care
yes
she
was
in
earnest
when
she
entered
the
room
he
noticed
at
once
the
dark
rims
which
pain
had
left
round
her
eyes
and
the
paleness
of
her
lips
and
yet
she
had
never
seemed
to
him
more
beautiful
she
wore
a
careless
artistic
of
blue
cashmere
bordered
with
creamy
lace
which
accumulated
on
her
breast
into
a
filmy
cloud
her
hair
only
simply
dressed
curled
in
countless
small
rings
over
brow
and
cheeks
and
was
massed
on
the
crown
of
her
head
into
a
knot
of
curls
which
was
surrounded
by
a
double
circlet
of
gold
leo
remembered
to
have
seen
such
heads
in
bathed
in
golden
tints
and
standing
out
in
relief
against
a
purple
as
if
emerging
from
some
background
of
mystery
you
have
been
suffering
he
exclaimed
extending
both
hands
towards
her
i
who
told
you
so
she
replied
with
a
tired
smile
as
she
sank
into
an
minna
told
me
instead
of
answering
she
lifted
her
eyebrows
languidly
and
stretched
out
a
limp
hand
for
a
cushion
to
support
her
neck
she
must
have
just
been
scenting
herself
for
her
person
exhaled
the
opoponax
perfume
more
overpoweringly
than
ever
leo
felt
signs
already
of
the
enervating
stupefaction
which
always
took
possession
of
his
brain
in
this
atmosphere
it
began
like
a
slight
pressure
on
the
temples
spreading
to
his
forehead
and
finally
encompassing
his
whole
head
with
iron
spans
felicitas
buried
her
face
in
the
hollow
of
her
supporting
arm
and
remained
motionless
good
god
what
ails
you
he
demanded
she
raised
her
head
slightly
and
smiled
at
him
hopelessly
what
ails
me
leo
i
wish
that
i
had
never
been
born
that
all
a
pious
wish
at
least
he
answered
with
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
sneer
now
tell
me
frankly
lizzie
he
exhorted
why
do
you
rave
against
yourself
like
this
there
is
no
sense
in
it
tell
me
why
because
i
am
learning
to
repent
a
spasm
shot
through
him
as
if
he
were
about
to
make
an
effort
to
protest
against
the
word
but
he
no
longer
had
the
power
the
life
that
he
had
been
leading
for
the
last
two
months
had
been
nothing
but
a
vain
struggle
against
and
repentance
hence
the
wrecking
of
his
whole
character
he
got
up
and
in
silence
paced
with
unsteady
steps
the
rosy
dimly
lighted
boudoir
then
he
came
close
to
her
and
leant
against
the
edge
of
her
chair
she
looked
up
at
him
with
plaintive
eyes
then
sighing
deeply
pressed
her
face
against
his
arm
he
would
have
drawn
back
but
he
did
not
wish
her
to
see
that
he
thought
this
contact
less
harmless
than
she
did
leo
i
suffer
unspeakable
agony
she
whispered
he
drew
his
arm
away
from
her
abruptly
and
sat
down
opposite
her
so
all
the
happiness
you
are
giving
ulrich
he
asked
is
nothing
but
a
delusion
and
a
sham
do
you
expect
me
to
make
it
a
reality
i
expect
nothing
i
only
wish
i
he
could
not
go
on
his
thoughts
moved
tardily
clumsily
he
only
knew
that
her
astonished
resentful
question
had
not
displeased
him
so
much
as
it
ought
to
have
done
the
promise
i
made
you
she
continued
i
have
honestly
kept
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
have
tried
to
be
a
good
housewife
worthy
of
him
a
wife
of
whom
he
need
not
be
ashamed
but
the
penance
i
have
imposed
on
myself
is
terrible
i
suffer
tortures
that
no
man
can
have
any
idea
of
and
do
you
imagine
that
i
am
lying
on
a
bed
of
roses
he
responded
you
what
do
you
want
then
he
burst
forth
i
ah
woman
little
do
you
know
what
i
endure
i
am
in
torment
i
appear
to
myself
polluted
from
head
to
foot
i
scarcely
know
how
to
look
honest
people
in
the
face
i
think
every
one
is
pointing
the
finger
of
scorn
at
me
if
it
goes
on
like
this
i
must
go
out
of
my
mind
is
that
bad
enough
she
let
her
eyes
rest
on
him
full
of
curiosity
something
like
stealthy
joy
shone
in
them
for
since
the
long
long
ago
he
had
never
poured
out
to
her
such
confidences
from
the
depths
of
his
being
can
i
help
you
she
murmured
he
laughed
stridently
oh
please
leo
do
talk
of
your
helping
he
answered
help
from
your
side
would
be
only
a
fresh
crime
besides
how
could
you
only
one
person
can
help
me
and
that
is
ulrich
for
god
sake
she
cried
out
you
are
not
thinking
of
calm
yourself
he
made
answer
i
know
what
i
owe
you
we
two
are
yoked
together
we
are
both
bound
to
hold
our
tongues
that
is
an
understood
thing
there
was
a
pause
then
felicitas
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
can
you
pray
leo
he
gazed
at
her
in
shocked
amazement
pray
indeed
it
well
for
those
who
can
but
i
have
sneaked
out
of
the
almighty
way
like
my
dog
leo
sneaks
out
of
my
way
when
he
has
torn
a
fowl
to
pieces
you
ought
to
try
she
said
with
her
most
pious
expression
it
has
done
wonders
for
me
lately
i
confide
all
my
yearning
to
the
merciful
ear
of
the
saviour
and
yearning
yearning
for
what
he
asked
she
smiled
in
confusion
really
you
ought
to
pray
she
repeated
indeed
perhaps
our
lord
is
only
inflicting
this
trial
on
us
as
a
test
of
our
faith
and
we
shall
come
through
it
glorified
it
may
be
that
it
is
part
of
his
system
of
salvation
to
tell
me
he
broke
in
aghast
have
you
been
calling
on
brenckenberg
god
forbid
she
cried
i
am
horribly
afraid
of
him
or
perhaps
on
johanna
no
she
answered
colouring
johanna
has
been
to
see
me
ah
indeed
do
be
so
hard
i
bless
the
day
that
led
me
to
her
arms
for
she
has
shown
me
the
way
to
the
cross
how
often
has
she
been
here
three
times
and
you
have
made
yourself
over
to
her
body
and
soul
she
shook
her
head
with
a
smile
i
have
only
done
that
for
one
person
in
the
world
she
said
there
is
much
that
i
can
not
speak
of
to
her
but
her
influence
has
been
of
infinite
benefit
to
me
he
gazed
before
him
meditatively
she
rose
and
came
close
to
his
chair
do
you
know
leo
she
said
with
a
dreamy
smile
it
would
be
so
nice
if
we
prayed
together
what
do
you
mean
she
was
embarrassed
i
mean
if
we
took
our
common
trouble
to
the
father
heavens
you
think
that
would
improve
matters
she
sighed
it
would
be
so
beautiful
she
whispered
how
do
you
propose
to
do
it
he
asked
shall
we
kneel
down
side
by
side
on
the
carpet
she
half
laughed
and
flushed
deeper
you
are
a
heathen
she
pouted
sitting
down
again
and
scoff
at
the
most
sacred
things
make
your
mind
easy
dear
child
he
said
seriously
i
have
long
ago
lost
the
humour
for
scoffing
well
then
you
can
at
least
pray
for
me
as
i
pray
for
you
do
you
really
do
that
he
asked
while
a
feeling
of
gratitude
stirred
gently
within
him
she
nodded
shamefacedly
and
cast
her
eyes
on
her
lap
it
is
the
utmost
i
can
do
she
murmured
again
there
was
silence
their
eyes
met
and
rested
in
each
depths
a
sweet
silent
sympathy
seemed
to
hover
between
them
like
a
mysterious
vapour
at
this
moment
leo
did
not
feel
the
chafing
of
his
chains
the
thoughts
of
both
went
back
to
their
past
we
were
too
happy
breathed
felicitas
that
is
why
we
must
suffer
so
much
now
he
did
not
answer
after
the
manner
of
man
he
retained
less
grateful
remembrances
than
she
did
of
the
bliss
that
had
been
theirs
she
became
doubtful
or
perhaps
you
were
not
happy
she
asked
he
nodded
for
against
his
will
he
was
falling
a
victim
to
old
memories
she
gazed
at
him
with
fixed
eyes
her
hands
pressed
hard
against
her
forehead
why
did
things
turn
out
so
she
whispered
why
could
we
not
be
strong
and
resist
the
temptation
why
there
is
no
in
the
matter
we
were
young
and
and
foolish
and
we
thought
of
nothing
i
for
my
part
wonder
now
how
i
could
have
seemed
so
sagacious
to
myself
and
not
cried
out
to
the
whole
world
what
a
dog
i
am
i
have
an
affair
with
a
woman
a
married
woman
but
at
first
in
the
beginning
how
did
you
feel
she
asked
what
in
the
beginning
when
you
first
guessed
my
love
when
ah
you
mean
that
night
do
you
still
remember
it
she
asked
leaning
over
to
him
a
pink
flame
leapt
up
in
her
cheeks
her
glance
swam
in
dreamy
reminiscence
how
can
such
things
be
forgotten
he
replied
frowning
and
smiling
at
the
same
time
one
must
carry
them
to
the
grave
and
as
you
rode
home
that
night
what
did
you
think
about
you
are
always
asking
what
i
thought
he
answered
while
visions
of
that
hour
mounted
to
his
brain
and
made
him
hot
i
rode
on
and
on
as
if
i
were
drunk
every
moment
i
expected
to
fall
out
of
the
saddle
and
when
i
came
to
my
own
meadows
i
drew
in
the
roan
you
remember
it
was
the
old
roan
then
with
the
white
feet
i
tethered
him
to
a
and
flung
myself
on
the
grass
it
must
have
been
nearly
two
but
it
was
a
very
close
sultry
night
just
a
streak
of
red
dawn
was
already
in
the
sky
there
i
lay
asking
myself
it
possible
can
you
really
have
experienced
it
are
there
such
hours
to
be
lived
on
earth
and
the
roan
grazed
all
the
time
and
round
about
was
the
hay
that
got
into
one
senses
ay
it
was
enough
to
drive
one
mad
a
soft
cry
escaped
her
lips
she
had
thrown
her
head
back
over
the
side
of
the
chair
the
blue
veins
stood
out
on
her
throat
her
breast
heaved
tumultuously
and
with
both
hands
pressed
to
her
heart
she
lay
gasping
for
breath
what
is
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
in
much
concern
for
he
feared
a
repetition
of
that
scene
nothing
nothing
it
is
only
my
stupid
heart
nothing
else
ca
i
get
you
anything
thank
you
it
will
soon
be
better
it
is
better
now
she
sat
up
and
as
if
to
allay
his
fears
smiled
mechanically
into
vacancy
then
she
began
to
talk
to
herself
as
if
in
a
dream
and
i
i
see
it
all
before
me
still
when
you
were
gone
i
went
to
the
window
and
listened
to
your
footsteps
in
the
garden
the
horse
neighed
from
the
hedge
it
saw
you
coming
and
then
there
was
a
sound
of
hoofs
echoing
softly
and
then
all
was
quiet
and
you
had
no
qualms
of
conscience
she
shook
her
head
with
a
blissful
smile
setting
the
waves
and
curls
of
her
hair
in
motion
so
that
they
whipped
her
over
cheek
and
throat
then
recollecting
how
serious
this
question
was
she
knitted
her
brows
and
grasped
her
temples
with
both
hands
in
those
days
she
said
dully
i
had
no
notion
of
what
conscience
meant
in
those
days
i
let
my
sinful
happiness
carry
me
along
joyously
to
the
edge
of
an
abyss
without
reflecting
that
night
in
my
ecstasy
i
tore
my
clothes
from
my
body
suddenly
she
paused
shocked
at
herself
her
fingers
which
had
been
fumbling
at
her
throat
had
caught
in
the
cloud
of
lace
with
a
thin
tearing
sound
some
thread
of
the
delicate
fabric
collapsed
she
smiled
at
him
in
dismay
then
she
quickly
turned
the
situation
off
with
a
jest
that
is
a
pity
she
said
it
is
real
old
flemish
daintily
she
knotted
the
ends
together
again
is
that
all
right
she
asked
he
did
not
answer
a
fresh
silence
took
paralysing
possession
of
the
pair
their
glance
wandered
away
as
if
they
no
longer
dared
meet
one
another
eyes
she
with
flushed
cheeks
gazed
at
the
toe
of
her
embroidered
turkish
slipper
which
with
its
gold
arabesques
shone
forth
from
the
hem
of
her
blue
cashmere
gown
he
gnawed
his
moustache
and
stared
up
at
the
ceiling
the
oil
in
the
two
lamps
hissed
and
hummed
with
a
subdued
murmur
the
wind
caressed
the
windowpanes
in
passing
the
clock
ticked
melodiously
it
was
a
sound
like
a
falling
at
regular
intervals
on
the
strings
of
a
harp
leo
felt
a
speechless
fury
boiling
within
him
he
wanted
to
move
but
could
not
stir
at
last
he
made
a
violent
effort
to
regain
his
manliness
why
do
we
grope
about
in
the
past
he
asked
jumping
to
his
feet
it
can
lead
to
no
good
it
helps
us
to
forget
the
misery
of
the
present
is
that
some
good
she
replied
he
did
not
contradict
her
and
turned
to
go
but
in
parting
he
caught
hold
of
her
in
a
sudden
spasm
of
rage
shook
her
hither
and
thither
and
burying
his
fingers
in
the
elastic
flesh
of
her
upper
arm
he
bent
down
and
muttered
in
her
ear
you
are
right
we
pray
xxvii
the
beginning
of
winter
found
everything
the
same
as
usual
at
the
parsonage
the
candidate
had
not
succeeded
in
raising
the
money
for
the
continuation
of
his
studies
he
therefore
was
preparing
calmly
to
spend
the
winter
term
under
the
paternal
roof
he
decided
to
employ
the
many
hours
of
leisure
which
stretched
before
him
in
settling
on
authorship
as
his
calling
in
life
and
to
write
an
work
which
would
raise
him
with
one
bound
to
the
highest
pinnacle
of
fame
the
work
was
to
be
of
a
scientific
character
and
to
give
shape
and
method
to
the
floating
chaotic
ideas
of
modernity
a
public
career
lay
open
to
him
also
all
you
had
to
do
to
be
elected
to
the
reichstag
was
to
sit
down
and
write
a
few
social
pamphlets
on
prostitution
or
the
duel
question
and
if
the
ministry
did
not
see
its
way
after
that
to
give
you
an
appointment
you
must
become
active
in
opposition
not
that
miserable
opposition
of
abortive
liberalism
but
the
firebrand
kind
of
lassalles
which
bore
upon
it
the
imprint
of
genius
and
left
plenty
of
time
over
for
love
adventures
altogether
it
had
been
easier
for
an
oswald
stein
in
those
days
as
an
adherent
of
the
sturm
and
drang
party
one
knew
what
to
be
at
to
cut
a
path
for
freedom
from
the
barricades
and
then
get
hewn
down
by
the
truncheons
of
tyranny
but
since
the
seventies
there
had
been
no
tyrants
and
people
no
longer
stirred
up
revolutions
it
was
considered
neither
gentlemanly
nor
modern
the
only
consolation
that
he
found
in
this
whirling
chaos
of
emotions
was
love
for
kurt
loved
and
was
beloved
the
blessed
knowledge
had
been
conveyed
to
him
in
a
note
sealed
by
a
rosebud
the
sort
of
stationery
affected
by
very
young
ladies
one
day
at
the
end
of
september
it
had
been
delivered
to
him
by
the
at
the
farm
and
had
run
as
follows
dear
herr
kandidat
the
song
stars
which
you
dedicated
to
me
is
quite
charming
unfortunately
my
brother
took
it
away
from
me
before
i
got
hold
of
it
i
must
warn
you
against
my
brother
for
he
is
very
angry
with
you
and
i
am
rather
afraid
he
may
challenge
you
that
would
be
so
awful
i
think
it
would
kill
me
i
beg
of
you
therefore
not
to
send
me
any
more
poems
or
if
you
do
please
do
address
them
to
halewitz
on
the
road
between
halewitz
and
wengern
there
are
some
milestones
with
figures
on
them
the
stone
that
i
mean
has
the
figures
on
it
will
you
please
bury
your
poems
in
the
earth
behind
the
stone
and
as
a
sign
that
you
have
buried
them
make
a
little
cross
out
of
twigs
and
stick
it
up
in
front
of
the
stone
then
i
should
know
directly
when
i
come
by
and
i
entreat
you
to
keep
this
a
secret
till
your
dying
day
for
i
am
strictly
watched
even
hertha
keeps
a
on
me
ah
it
is
dreadful
with
kind
regards
yours
sincerely
s
please
do
it
soon
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
lively
correspondence
between
elly
and
the
candidate
which
was
conducted
partly
in
verse
and
partly
in
prose
and
left
nothing
to
be
desired
in
fire
and
ardour
kurt
opinion
of
himself
rose
tremendously
under
its
influence
oswald
stein
now
had
the
advantage
of
him
in
nothing
in
case
melitta
that
was
to
say
felicitas
persisted
in
scorning
him
at
least
the
little
fair
girl
who
was
so
madly
in
love
with
him
still
remained
he
had
forgotten
her
name
in
the
book
but
he
would
call
her
elly
for
the
nonce
elly
sentimental
scrawls
provided
him
with
enough
amusement
to
kill
time
they
alternated
between
poetic
gush
such
as
one
finds
in
novels
and
comical
outbursts
of
alarm
myrtle
wreaths
the
song
of
the
nightingale
and
starlit
spheres
were
phrases
as
numerous
as
stabs
of
conscience
suicide
and
desperation
twice
already
she
had
implored
him
to
end
the
correspondence
and
to
set
her
free
but
there
was
always
a
fresh
communication
behind
the
milestone
kurt
was
amply
employed
in
consoling
and
encouraging
her
and
forecasting
the
golden
time
when
they
would
be
united
for
ever
seriously
he
had
no
hopes
of
anything
of
the
kind
happening
it
was
not
likely
the
proud
clod
of
a
squire
would
be
so
and
accommodating
as
to
lay
his
still
youngest
sister
in
arms
and
it
would
be
derogatory
for
a
man
of
his
talent
and
prospects
to
take
her
without
leave
and
hamper
himself
with
an
unprofitable
bride
he
had
difficulties
enough
to
contend
with
without
that
his
old
father
set
up
to
it
probably
was
beginning
to
cast
a
disapproving
eye
on
his
son
manner
of
life
and
veiled
allusions
concerning
the
lilies
of
the
field
and
loaves
and
fishes
made
him
feel
very
uncomfortable
one
day
in
the
middle
of
october
the
bomb
burst
kurt
who
had
reposed
till
eleven
in
bed
feeling
the
necessity
of
a
little
light
refreshment
before
the
midday
meal
went
on
a
foraging
expedition
to
the
cupboard
the
place
where
one
would
naturally
expect
to
find
a
miscellaneous
assortment
of
ham
pickled
eels
cold
roast
veal
cold
fried
potatoes
and
mashed
turnips
he
was
interrupted
in
the
business
of
choosing
between
these
dainties
by
the
old
pastor
who
laid
a
heavy
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
asked
whether
he
intended
to
make
it
his
vocation
for
the
rest
of
his
life
to
eat
up
all
the
remains
of
the
family
meals
kurt
assumed
the
air
of
an
offended
prince
a
man
must
live
he
replied
loftily
or
do
you
wish
to
imply
come
to
my
study
broke
in
the
old
man
very
well
said
kurt
wiping
his
mouth
you
are
my
father
so
i
must
obey
you
and
he
made
a
sign
to
show
that
he
bowed
to
the
paternal
authority
come
now
we
will
speak
in
plain
language
my
boy
the
old
fellow
began
sinking
into
his
shabby
cushioned
chair
in
all
my
days
i
have
never
come
across
such
a
cursed
jackanapes
as
you
are
you
drink
like
a
fish
swagger
and
bully
like
a
all
very
well
and
most
pleasing
to
me
but
do
you
think
that
you
can
go
on
loafing
kurt
controlled
his
resentment
with
difficulty
i
do
understand
father
he
said
how
you
can
call
it
loafing
periods
of
inactive
development
are
as
necessary
to
the
mind
as
the
of
hibernating
is
to
nature
while
i
am
to
all
appearances
idle
i
work
incessantly
at
my
individuality
i
cultivate
my
manhood
my
personality
is
maturing
that
is
worth
more
than
any
book
learning
very
well
my
son
the
old
man
replied
do
be
discouraged
keep
up
your
calm
impudence
and
the
rest
will
take
care
of
itself
but
i
tell
you
for
all
that
the
world
is
a
big
place
go
and
mature
your
personality
somewhere
else
and
find
another
for
your
fads
certainly
i
would
with
pleasure
papa
kurt
replied
if
i
had
the
necessary
funds
the
two
months
salary
the
baron
von
kletzingk
gave
you
would
have
been
enough
to
live
on
for
a
whole
term
if
you
had
not
squandered
it
you
know
that
you
need
expect
a
farthing
from
me
get
the
money
as
best
you
can
but
remember
in
eight
days
you
clear
out
of
this
all
right
kurt
replied
with
dignity
getting
up
i
will
go
to
ruin
on
the
king
highway
but
it
seems
a
pity
just
as
my
nature
has
taken
a
start
and
i
begin
to
be
conscious
of
unsuspected
springs
of
energy
within
me
but
we
wo
speak
about
it
further
the
door
of
my
house
is
to
be
shut
on
me
and
with
justice
your
has
been
boundless
father
i
thank
you
and
i
will
at
once
try
and
raise
a
little
money
farewell
and
he
left
the
room
the
old
man
looked
after
him
shaking
his
head
what
a
young
scamp
it
is
he
said
full
of
admiration
i
was
just
such
another
kurt
filled
with
bitter
feelings
climbed
up
to
the
attic
he
threw
himself
on
his
bed
to
reflect
on
his
position
and
also
to
await
the
dinner
hour
there
was
baked
ham
with
dumplings
for
dinner
a
dish
which
could
be
cooked
in
no
university
town
so
excellently
as
in
the
parental
house
it
was
sad
that
the
ham
came
to
an
end
so
soon
and
that
his
father
announced
there
would
before
long
be
one
less
to
feed
at
the
table
when
kurt
had
composed
himself
a
little
he
went
the
round
of
neighbouring
estates
to
see
what
was
to
be
done
in
the
money
line
how
brutal
it
is
he
thought
that
a
man
fine
ambitions
should
be
chased
away
by
sordid
cares
and
while
he
plodded
along
the
country
roads
it
became
clearer
than
ever
that
pessimism
was
the
only
philosophy
of
life
worthy
of
consideration
he
resolved
to
air
his
views
in
some
great
work
which
should
take
the
form
either
of
childe
harold
or
the
philosophy
of
the
unknown
grey
clouds
raced
over
the
sky
the
wind
whistled
across
the
furrows
and
ravens
circled
weirdly
above
the
everything
was
vast
and
dreary
like
his
mood
the
proceeds
of
his
first
day
crusade
was
a
piece
lent
by
the
newly
appointed
bailiff
at
ellernthal
a
novel
of
zola
also
lent
and
a
fit
of
the
blues
the
second
day
he
fared
no
better
and
on
the
third
there
seemed
to
be
little
doubt
that
his
credit
for
ten
miles
round
had
been
exhausted
now
he
became
so
utterly
disconsolate
that
he
thought
of
taking
his
life
but
the
same
day
he
received
a
note
which
bore
a
certain
family
resemblance
to
elly
missives
only
there
was
no
rosebud
the
signature
was
hertha
von
prachwitz
she
too
he
thought
and
an
indescribable
feeling
of
satisfaction
ran
through
his
veins
hertha
urgently
requested
an
interview
of
ten
minutes
with
him
and
named
as
a
place
of
meeting
the
churchyard
at
wengern
and
the
hour
six
in
the
evening
one
knows
pretty
well
what
those
urgent
interviews
mean
he
thought
twisting
his
moustache
with
a
smile
after
all
any
one
who
was
invited
to
a
rendezvous
with
countesses
need
not
despair
to
dodge
those
who
might
spy
on
his
movements
he
took
a
longish
walk
towards
evening
from
which
he
tried
to
return
unobserved
for
the
churchyard
was
only
a
few
steps
distant
from
the
parsonage
on
the
stroke
of
six
he
emerged
from
the
shadow
of
the
church
porch
and
saw
hertha
figure
darkly
silhouetted
in
the
late
twilight
as
she
sat
waiting
on
a
tombstone
his
heart
beat
riotously
in
delighted
anticipation
he
approached
her
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
what
a
fascination
and
charm
there
must
be
about
my
person
he
reflected
if
even
this
haughty
highflyer
succumbs
to
it
hertha
shot
up
at
sight
of
him
she
wore
her
old
grey
cloak
and
had
drawn
the
hood
over
her
head
and
tied
it
under
the
chin
she
was
painfully
excited
her
hands
clasped
the
grave
railings
convulsively
her
eyes
flashed
in
the
darkness
you
will
think
that
this
is
a
strange
proceeding
herr
kandidat
she
said
in
a
trembling
voice
oh
no
not
at
all
he
assured
her
with
a
gallant
bow
ordinarily
she
went
on
girls
like
me
are
not
in
the
habit
of
appointing
to
meet
people
she
halted
there
was
something
in
her
tone
which
made
him
feel
a
trifle
less
triumphant
it
was
almost
as
if
she
would
have
said
people
of
your
position
wait
a
bit
he
thought
i
soon
bring
her
down
but
your
stupid
conduct
to
my
cousin
she
continued
compels
me
to
speak
very
seriously
to
you
kurt
felt
very
much
as
if
a
bucket
of
cold
water
had
been
hurled
at
him
it
was
evident
what
had
happened
elly
had
told
tales
and
hertha
whether
jealous
or
not
had
made
up
her
mind
to
put
obstacles
in
his
way
i
beg
pardon
countess
he
said
raising
his
hand
in
dignified
protest
this
is
a
matter
of
a
very
private
nature
i
do
know
how
far
and
by
what
means
you
have
gained
the
confidence
of
your
cousin
fräulein
elly
and
i
for
my
part
can
not
flatter
myself
that
i
have
your
confidence
therefore
if
you
will
allow
me
he
raised
his
hat
as
a
sign
that
he
desired
to
end
the
conversation
listen
to
me
if
you
please
herr
kandidat
said
hertha
and
her
eyes
flashed
wrathfully
if
you
adopt
this
tone
towards
me
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
you
talk
in
riddles
he
replied
with
a
smirk
i
am
ready
to
express
myself
as
plainly
as
you
like
said
hertha
i
have
run
over
here
secretly
and
at
great
risk
and
you
thought
of
going
away
and
leaving
me
in
the
lurch
like
a
naughty
schoolboy
in
his
most
cavalier
style
he
begged
her
pardon
and
submitted
to
hear
what
was
coming
why
do
you
leave
my
cousin
alone
asked
hertha
measuring
him
with
a
scornful
eye
from
head
to
toe
i
love
fräulein
elly
he
replied
and
i
will
annihilate
all
who
thwart
my
love
do
be
so
impertinent
herr
kandidat
no
one
will
believe
you
they
shall
be
made
to
believe
he
said
when
two
young
hearts
love
who
shall
come
between
them
hertha
shrugged
her
shoulders
elly
does
not
love
you
herr
kandidat
she
said
i
happen
to
possess
proofs
to
the
contrary
he
replied
with
another
polite
bow
ah
you
mean
the
silly
letters
asked
hertha
if
she
had
begun
to
write
them
behind
my
back
i
should
long
ago
have
put
a
stop
to
it
yesterday
she
came
to
me
and
implored
me
to
save
her
and
i
mean
to
save
her
herr
kandidat
even
if
it
should
cost
me
my
life
save
her
from
what
if
i
may
venture
to
ask
countess
from
you
herr
kandidat
she
has
begged
you
more
than
once
to
leave
her
in
peace
and
told
you
that
you
frightened
her
but
you
have
continued
in
spite
of
that
to
bombard
her
with
your
crazy
letters
verses
and
stuff
the
verses
are
even
original
and
the
rest
is
all
lies
so
now
you
know
what
i
think
herr
kandidat
kurt
gnawed
his
moustache
it
seemed
as
if
the
prospect
of
a
double
defeat
lay
before
him
but
he
would
not
lose
the
battle
without
a
last
struggle
my
good
breeding
prevents
my
answering
a
lady
in
the
tone
which
you
have
chosen
to
adopt
towards
me
but
i
should
be
glad
to
know
why
if
your
cousin
fräulein
elly
holds
me
in
such
detestation
and
finds
my
letters
so
senseless
has
she
demeaned
herself
to
invite
me
to
enter
into
a
correspondence
with
her
and
why
up
to
the
present
has
she
not
disdained
to
answer
my
letters
hertha
bit
her
lips
it
was
no
easy
task
to
defend
elly
folly
a
silence
ensued
the
autumn
wind
moaned
in
the
larches
and
brought
down
with
every
gust
a
shower
of
fine
prickly
rain
hertha
appeared
to
herself
unspeakably
stupid
and
silly
if
she
had
had
her
she
would
have
loved
to
bring
it
about
the
ears
of
the
youth
who
maintained
his
dandified
air
and
was
straining
every
muscle
to
impress
her
as
a
model
of
gentlemanly
forbearance
but
it
would
not
have
helped
matters
you
do
answer
me
exclaimed
kurt
brenckenberg
at
last
triumphantly
then
naturally
i
draw
my
own
conclusions
good
gracious
herr
kandidat
said
hertha
elevating
her
shoulders
contemptuously
do
you
imagine
i
am
going
to
dispute
with
you
elly
has
not
had
my
experience
of
life
she
is
still
a
silly
young
thing
and
it
was
very
wrong
of
you
to
take
advantage
of
her
silliness
she
thought
that
she
was
bound
to
answer
your
letters
that
is
the
long
and
short
of
it
and
now
i
will
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
do
dare
come
near
her
again
or
write
notes
or
sing
songs
in
the
park
or
carry
on
any
more
of
that
nonsense
for
if
you
do
i
will
tell
my
brother
the
whole
story
and
he
will
point
out
to
you
clearly
your
duty
in
the
matter
good
evening
herr
kandidat
she
drew
her
skirts
together
and
passed
by
him
with
the
dead
leaves
fluttering
around
her
for
a
long
time
kurt
stared
blankly
after
her
the
slender
upright
girlish
figure
was
silhouetted
in
picturesque
outline
against
the
sky
and
then
vanished
behind
the
churchyard
wall
what
a
dog
life
it
is
he
murmured
one
begins
to
think
one
has
a
heart
and
then
it
all
comes
to
nothing
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
grave
and
brooded
the
wind
howled
and
the
dry
leaves
came
whirling
down
like
autumnal
spirits
he
reflected
on
fame
heroism
the
madness
of
love
and
the
perishableness
of
all
earthly
things
when
a
man
has
no
money
he
is
nearly
as
good
as
dead
he
quoted
sadly
and
then
stood
up
for
was
drawing
near
xxviii
one
afternoon
ulrich
rode
over
to
halewitz
with
the
news
that
a
meeting
of
the
reichstag
had
been
called
for
the
third
week
in
november
leo
was
alarmed
for
it
meant
nothing
less
than
being
left
ten
days
alone
with
felicitas
in
every
limb
he
felt
the
shock
which
seemed
to
be
propelling
him
several
steps
nearer
the
unknown
fate
that
loomed
in
front
of
him
he
could
have
caught
ulrich
hands
and
cried
in
his
ears
if
you
value
both
our
lives
stay
here
and
he
was
still
in
this
frame
of
mind
when
his
friend
approached
him
with
an
extraordinary
proposal
felicitas
has
begged
me
he
said
with
his
quiet
friendly
smile
in
which
pure
goodness
of
heart
put
to
flight
all
gravity
to
be
spokesman
for
her
in
giving
expression
to
a
desire
which
she
has
long
had
very
much
at
heart
a
desire
shared
by
your
sister
johanna
both
wish
that
our
respective
families
should
partake
together
of
the
holy
sacrament
on
the
day
before
my
departure
leo
was
filled
with
joy
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
a
sustaining
hand
had
been
stretched
out
to
him
from
the
clouds
to
afford
him
anchor
and
refuge
in
the
whirlwind
by
which
he
had
been
threatened
this
ceremony
would
be
a
protection
in
the
hours
to
be
passed
alone
with
her
it
would
be
the
highest
consecration
of
his
purer
will
and
what
do
you
think
about
it
uli
he
asked
looking
inquiringly
at
his
friend
i
for
my
part
seek
and
value
every
opportunity
he
replied
smiling
back
at
leo
which
lifts
me
above
the
barren
level
of
thoughts
were
my
breathing
apparatus
like
other
people
i
should
love
to
climb
to
high
places
and
get
a
wider
outlook
such
an
outlook
over
what
has
been
and
is
to
be
is
found
in
preparing
for
the
sacrament
i
have
heavy
work
in
prospect
this
winter
and
shall
be
obliged
in
my
section
to
offer
opposition
to
the
tactics
of
my
friends
it
will
do
me
good
to
travel
to
golgotha
beforehand
to
prove
whether
i
am
fit
for
it
what
worlds
he
is
above
me
thought
leo
he
lives
in
the
heart
of
his
ideals
and
suspects
nothing
of
the
pack
of
impure
thoughts
some
people
have
to
drag
about
with
them
it
now
only
remained
to
be
decided
which
church
should
be
chosen
leo
was
certain
that
felicitas
would
sooner
die
than
stand
with
him
before
the
revengeful
countenance
of
pastor
brenckenberg
and
he
too
could
not
have
endured
the
ordeal
anxiety
at
the
threats
and
antics
of
this
man
who
knew
would
have
dispelled
all
devotional
feeling
also
the
neighbouring
parish
in
which
uhlenfelde
was
included
must
be
avoided
or
brenckenberg
jealous
fury
would
be
aroused
there
remained
as
neutral
ground
münsterberg
and
it
seemed
advisable
to
drive
over
to
the
church
of
superintendent
fürbringer
who
was
much
beloved
in
the
district
for
his
mild
christian
spirit
and
charitable
disposition
the
rest
was
easily
arranged
grandmamma
who
consented
joyfully
undertook
to
inform
johanna
of
the
plan
and
the
chicks
were
not
even
consulted
when
leo
entered
the
castle
of
uhlenfelde
the
next
day
his
hand
was
seized
in
a
woman
warm
trembling
clasp
and
he
heard
a
fervid
whisper
at
his
ear
thank
you
oh
thank
you
he
drew
back
astonished
a
shadow
glided
away
a
glass
door
rattled
in
the
distance
perplexed
stunned
as
if
he
had
encountered
a
vision
he
groped
his
way
on
to
ulrich
study
those
hotly
whispered
words
of
thanks
continued
to
ring
in
his
ears
the
week
passed
in
nervous
impatience
on
saturday
morning
they
were
to
drive
over
to
confession
and
johanna
came
to
the
castle
to
join
the
others
in
the
searching
glance
she
directed
to
him
leo
recognised
with
horror
her
suspicions
he
felt
that
it
would
be
beyond
his
powers
of
endurance
to
take
an
hour
drive
with
the
gaze
fixed
on
him
so
he
ordered
round
the
small
for
his
own
use
hertha
who
sat
by
the
window
in
hat
and
cloak
heard
him
and
looked
surprised
as
her
eyes
wandered
out
into
the
pouring
rain
and
johanna
who
seemed
to
understand
his
reasons
smiled
sourly
to
herself
the
family
coach
started
with
its
freight
of
ladies
and
leo
followed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
wrapped
in
his
mackintosh
with
his
scotch
cap
pressed
far
back
on
his
neck
chewing
his
extinguished
cigar
he
drove
along
the
spongy
roads
he
had
left
his
man
behind
for
he
wished
to
be
alone
he
was
approaching
the
religious
business
as
an
adventure
an
adventure
on
the
result
of
which
the
weal
or
woe
of
his
whole
future
depended
the
strength
that
he
no
longer
found
in
himself
should
descend
on
him
from
heaven
in
this
mystery
of
incarnation
either
the
grace
of
god
would
endue
him
with
peace
now
and
henceforth
or
it
would
be
lost
to
him
for
ever
he
drove
by
the
wengern
parsonage
with
averted
face
as
if
he
were
a
thief
slinking
by
and
in
reality
it
was
rather
like
it
stealthily
and
by
a
back
way
he
was
going
to
creep
into
the
circle
of
the
divine
forgiveness
and
try
and
obtain
by
a
miracle
what
others
struggled
for
with
clean
hands
and
hearts
and
by
dint
of
strong
effort
the
wheels
rattled
down
into
the
ferry
ruts
old
jürgens
informed
him
respectfully
that
the
ladies
had
just
been
taken
across
ah
the
one
who
will
be
the
gnädiger
herr
young
bride
is
an
angel
he
added
beaming
while
he
let
the
dripping
rope
glide
through
his
horny
fingers
bride
which
do
you
mean
why
gnädiger
herr
the
young
gracious
countess
of
course
replied
jürgens
and
winked
slyly
as
people
are
wont
to
do
when
talking
of
a
pair
is
the
fellow
mad
he
thought
but
fear
disarmed
his
anger
what
would
happen
to
hertha
if
this
gossip
was
already
afloat
since
that
last
encounter
they
had
been
as
strangers
to
each
other
and
had
scarcely
exchanged
a
morning
or
evening
salutation
and
now
there
could
be
no
further
question
between
them
of
two
souls
seeking
a
common
ground
of
agreement
that
which
their
silence
concealed
meant
an
eternal
estrangement
but
what
did
it
all
matter
compared
with
that
great
need
of
his
which
swallowed
all
minor
cares
losses
and
trials
as
if
they
had
never
existed
peace
peace
at
any
price
the
halewitz
and
uhlenfelde
carriages
were
drawn
up
tractably
side
by
side
at
the
münsterberg
church
door
and
a
few
peasant
equipages
modestly
brought
up
the
rear
he
stepped
into
the
grey
bare
church
the
first
thing
his
eye
lighted
on
were
the
words
in
gigantic
gold
letters
peace
be
with
you
which
shone
above
the
altar
in
a
they
seemed
the
solitary
decorations
which
this
bare
house
stuffed
with
benches
contained
but
what
more
did
it
want
what
they
promised
to
the
pious
worshipper
as
a
matter
of
course
was
the
one
essential
for
which
he
was
striving
the
words
affected
him
so
powerfully
that
he
felt
his
tears
rising
he
hid
himself
quickly
behind
a
pillar
and
laid
his
open
hand
across
his
eyes
he
cursed
his
and
conjured
up
some
of
his
wildest
memories
in
order
to
regain
the
mastery
of
himself
at
last
he
dared
to
venture
forth
and
look
around
him
on
the
middle
benches
sat
several
groups
of
working
people
women
who
had
cried
their
noses
red
and
men
who
stared
with
vacant
curiosity
at
the
organ
and
choir
his
own
people
had
not
yet
entered
the
church
apparently
they
were
still
lingering
in
the
vestry
which
was
always
open
to
the
high
nobility
thither
he
betook
himself
his
footsteps
echoed
through
the
aisles
the
praying
women
raised
their
noses
a
little
the
men
watched
him
idly
felicitas
was
the
first
to
meet
him
in
the
vestry
he
recoiled
with
an
involuntary
shudder
then
quickly
recovered
himself
and
gravely
gave
her
his
hand
feeling
conscious
that
johanna
was
keenly
observing
every
of
their
meeting
and
as
he
looked
up
he
was
aware
that
from
the
dark
background
a
second
pair
of
eyes
rested
on
them
with
questioning
anxiety
then
ulrich
came
to
shake
him
by
the
hand
and
to
introduce
him
to
the
superintendent
a
lean
man
with
glasses
and
greyish
whiskers
who
welcomed
him
in
a
clear
high
tenor
his
voice
sounded
in
his
ears
like
a
orison
compared
with
thunderous
growl
they
now
moved
into
the
church
and
took
their
places
on
the
benches
ulrich
sat
on
leo
right
elly
on
his
left
so
everything
was
arranged
as
it
should
be
the
service
began
a
chorale
was
sung
and
the
usual
penitential
prayer
followed
leo
strove
to
attend
but
he
could
not
succeed
he
still
stared
as
if
fascinated
at
the
golden
words
which
shone
down
on
him
from
the
wall
like
a
magic
formula
he
tried
to
tear
his
eyes
away
from
them
but
they
seemed
almost
to
hypnotise
him
peace
peace
at
any
price
and
then
suddenly
words
from
the
altar
penetrated
to
his
ear
in
virtue
of
my
spiritual
office
i
announce
to
thee
thy
sins
are
forgiven
he
started
up
in
surprise
could
it
be
so
rapidly
so
simply
done
that
for
which
he
had
struggled
with
the
tension
of
despair
with
the
offering
up
of
his
whole
nature
was
here
after
a
few
moments
of
uncomfortable
meditation
tossed
into
his
lap
like
a
casual
gift
with
a
stereotyped
speech
by
a
strange
man
how
could
it
how
dared
it
happen
thus
close
by
him
sat
the
man
against
whom
he
had
sinned
not
to
mention
that
other
who
rotted
in
the
earth
a
little
father
away
was
the
woman
with
whom
he
had
sinned
flooding
him
with
the
horror
of
her
presence
and
behind
her
she
who
knew
all
everything
was
just
as
it
had
been
five
minutes
ago
yet
in
spite
of
that
his
guilt
was
to
be
instantly
wiped
out
because
the
quiet
man
up
there
in
virtue
of
his
office
chose
to
say
so
forsooth
how
was
one
to
believe
it
the
organ
passed
into
the
arabesques
of
a
florid
voluntary
the
confession
was
at
an
end
as
leo
gave
the
superintendent
his
hand
at
parting
he
met
a
friendly
glance
from
behind
the
which
seemed
to
say
taken
altogether
you
must
be
a
fine
fellow
i
was
once
thought
leo
responding
mutely
to
the
mute
speech
and
he
resolved
on
the
spot
to
seek
counsel
and
rest
for
his
soul
from
this
man
of
peace
pleading
business
in
the
town
he
left
his
party
to
drive
home
without
him
he
promised
ulrich
to
look
in
at
night
and
avoiding
a
last
significant
look
of
lizzie
he
went
to
lounge
away
two
unprofitable
hours
on
the
horsehair
cushions
of
the
prussian
crown
pawing
without
appetite
the
food
which
the
officious
landlord
set
before
him
then
he
found
his
way
to
the
superintendent
house
while
the
rain
still
poured
from
the
heavens
the
deal
floor
of
the
as
he
came
into
it
gleamed
silver
in
its
polished
cleanliness
as
if
it
had
just
come
from
the
carpenter
the
same
aggressive
polish
radiated
from
the
steps
of
the
wooden
staircase
which
led
to
the
first
floor
every
rib
and
vein
in
the
boards
was
visible
though
they
might
have
lain
there
for
many
years
biblical
pictures
in
mahogany
frames
crowned
with
wreaths
of
immortelles
hung
on
the
chalk
of
the
walls
a
distinct
odour
of
freshly
roasted
coffee
permeated
the
atmosphere
an
odour
which
has
a
habit
of
clinging
to
dwellings
in
which
painful
neatness
is
combined
with
modest
cheer
and
thus
counts
as
a
guarantee
of
bourgeois
domestic
bliss
the
door
was
opened
noiselessly
by
a
girl
of
twelve
who
appeared
on
the
threshold
in
a
stiffly
starched
apron
with
lappets
which
spread
over
her
shoulders
like
the
collar
of
a
mandarin
she
giggled
artlessly
and
then
waited
silently
to
hear
what
he
wanted
her
flaxen
hair
differed
so
little
from
the
colour
of
her
skin
and
was
strained
back
so
smoothly
and
flat
over
her
head
that
without
the
plaits
which
formed
a
nest
on
her
neck
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
see
that
she
was
not
bald
when
leo
had
expressed
his
wishes
she
rubbed
her
nose
a
moment
and
then
vanished
through
another
door
not
a
sound
was
now
audible
so
this
is
what
peace
looks
like
thought
leo
glancing
round
him
he
felt
as
if
he
were
standing
at
the
entrance
of
the
promised
land
papa
says
will
you
come
in
please
said
the
little
girl
with
another
spasmodic
giggle
he
walked
in
the
superintendent
in
his
long
alpaca
with
the
pattern
of
the
cushion
against
which
he
had
been
reclining
imprinted
in
red
lines
on
his
right
cheek
stood
at
the
door
he
was
wiping
his
glasses
and
blinked
sleepily
with
his
shortsighted
eyes
pardon
he
said
in
a
friendly
tone
i
have
just
been
taking
my
midday
and
have
been
lying
on
my
glasses
without
them
i
am
not
quite
sure
with
whom
i
have
the
pleasure
when
leo
gave
his
name
the
expression
of
the
thin
mild
face
became
a
shade
friendlier
without
losing
its
composure
this
is
a
real
honour
for
me
herr
von
sellenthin
he
said
and
invited
him
to
sit
down
on
the
sofa
covered
with
red
flowery
cretonne
which
as
leo
dropped
on
to
it
uttered
a
squeaking
sound
and
the
springs
of
which
made
themselves
disagreeably
felt
there
are
many
roads
which
lead
men
to
men
continued
the
shepherd
of
souls
may
i
hope
that
the
one
you
have
come
by
is
blessed
he
stretched
out
both
his
hands
to
leo
who
seized
them
with
grateful
warmth
it
may
surprise
you
herr
superintendent
he
began
pardon
dear
herr
von
sellenthin
on
the
contrary
i
might
almost
say
with
truth
that
i
expected
you
how
expected
me
echoed
leo
astonished
could
there
be
anything
more
natural
than
that
the
penitent
who
is
confiding
his
conscience
to
an
unknown
man
who
promises
him
something
so
infinitely
great
should
wish
to
enter
into
closer
human
relations
with
him
although
we
as
protestants
do
not
recognise
the
institution
of
a
father
confessor
we
do
desire
to
administer
our
healing
in
the
lump
each
of
us
has
his
peculiarity
his
prejudices
and
to
come
to
the
worst
his
doubts
and
it
is
to
discuss
one
or
other
of
these
points
if
i
am
not
mistaken
that
you
have
honoured
me
by
coming
here
you
are
right
herr
superintendent
leo
replied
his
confidence
growing
and
there
is
one
more
thing
that
i
would
say
my
worthy
friend
i
do
not
intrude
into
the
secrets
of
my
brother
penitents
and
have
no
wish
that
they
shall
specify
categorically
the
causes
of
their
heaviness
of
heart
for
that
is
difficult
and
awkward
for
both
sides
it
was
not
my
intention
to
do
so
said
leo
capital
all
the
easier
will
it
be
to
gain
our
object
and
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
he
invited
leo
to
explain
how
his
affairs
stood
you
may
have
heard
herr
superintendent
that
i
for
a
long
time
shunned
my
birthplace
leo
began
involuntarily
adopting
somewhat
in
spite
of
his
natural
bluntness
the
form
of
speech
of
the
pulpit
orator
i
have
certainly
heard
something
to
that
effect
replied
the
latter
cautiously
for
years
i
was
knocking
about
in
foreign
countries
and
gave
very
little
thought
to
the
salvation
of
my
soul
i
lived
according
to
the
morals
and
customs
of
my
surroundings
and
saw
nothing
wrong
in
so
doing
that
can
be
taken
for
granted
the
superintendent
put
in
but
now
that
i
find
myself
back
and
in
normal
circumstances
i
see
with
horror
the
nature
of
the
crime
i
am
guilty
of
the
superintendent
made
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
and
stroked
his
shaven
chin
that
too
is
easily
understood
put
yourself
in
my
place
what
once
had
seemed
perfectly
legitimate
and
in
accordance
with
my
sense
of
honour
began
to
disturb
my
conscience
to
torment
me
at
night
to
hunt
me
about
by
day
to
render
me
slack
in
body
and
intellect
in
fact
it
has
so
transformed
my
character
that
i
am
but
the
shadow
of
my
former
self
the
parson
nodded
contentedly
like
a
doctor
does
when
the
patient
enumerates
one
after
the
other
symptoms
of
the
disease
which
he
has
diagnosed
beforehand
and
for
this
evil
you
seek
a
remedy
he
asked
yes
my
dear
friend
even
in
the
very
evil
itself
lies
the
remedy
leo
felt
the
blind
anger
rise
within
him
which
now
so
frequently
overwhelmed
him
this
after
all
came
to
very
much
the
same
as
brenckenberg
doctrine
do
frown
my
dear
friend
nor
argue
with
god
but
fold
your
hands
and
praise
his
holy
name
for
the
grace
which
has
brought
you
even
to
this
condition
of
mind
and
laid
this
leaven
in
your
heart
to
prepare
it
for
the
blessings
he
will
rain
on
you
what
blessings
the
blessings
of
his
infinite
mercy
how
can
you
even
ask
when
you
already
stand
on
the
threshold
of
salvation
like
the
blind
man
led
by
god
angel
you
have
been
wandering
you
knew
not
whither
and
while
you
have
been
thinking
yourself
lost
you
suddenly
find
yourself
even
at
the
door
of
heaven
a
hidden
voice
has
been
bidding
you
to
the
table
and
this
voice
was
even
the
voice
of
divine
grace
defiance
and
suspicion
fought
for
the
mastery
in
leo
soul
the
little
word
even
which
the
man
interpolated
so
repeatedly
into
his
sentences
irritated
him
after
using
it
he
had
a
habit
of
pausing
while
he
smacked
his
lips
so
that
however
dulcet
and
consoling
his
words
might
be
it
gave
his
delivery
an
air
of
dryness
but
never
for
a
moment
did
he
abandon
the
quiet
modest
warmhearted
tone
with
which
he
had
wooed
leo
confidence
from
the
first
and
therefore
my
dear
friend
i
may
even
promise
you
that
you
will
experience
a
divine
miracle
the
moment
that
the
sacred
chalice
touches
your
lips
the
trouble
you
suffer
from
will
be
charmed
away
and
at
the
same
time
the
sin
which
you
so
earnestly
repent
will
cease
to
distress
you
if
you
had
not
intimated
this
penitence
to
me
i
could
not
speak
with
such
assurance
but
now
i
may
bid
you
welcome
as
a
worthy
guest
whose
soul
is
clad
in
white
garments
to
god
table
leo
suppressed
a
scoffing
smile
how
unsuspecting
and
innocent
it
all
sounded
this
worthy
man
with
his
feet
on
the
spotless
scrubbed
boards
of
his
house
breathing
in
the
soothing
fumes
of
roasted
tattooing
his
cheek
every
afternoon
with
the
impress
of
the
cushion
what
did
he
know
of
the
depths
and
tortures
of
the
hell
in
which
he
wrestled
and
notwithstanding
how
full
of
promises
and
evangelical
consolation
were
his
pronouncements
to
hear
him
was
like
listening
to
a
lullaby
one
sings
to
a
crying
infant
a
miracle
was
to
happen
in
truth
a
miracle
must
come
to
pass
for
in
it
his
only
chance
of
redemption
lay
he
had
been
on
the
watch
for
a
miracle
and
now
one
was
prophesied
what
more
could
he
desire
meanwhile
the
little
daughter
had
come
in
from
the
next
room
and
now
leaning
against
her
father
knee
she
whispered
something
in
his
ear
he
looked
at
the
clock
smacked
his
dry
lips
as
if
he
were
on
the
point
of
saying
even
and
shook
his
head
smiling
then
a
bright
idea
seemed
to
strike
him
he
turned
to
leo
it
would
be
doing
us
a
great
honour
if
you
would
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
with
us
quietly
it
might
have
been
interpreted
as
a
slight
if
he
had
declined
the
invitation
and
two
minutes
later
the
small
daughter
biting
her
lips
in
anxiety
lest
she
should
spill
anything
carried
in
a
china
from
which
the
fragrance
of
coffee
which
had
hitherto
faintly
filled
the
air
streamed
in
full
strength
a
woman
hand
with
a
polished
on
it
was
visible
for
a
moment
at
the
latch
of
the
door
but
having
done
its
duty
was
about
to
be
withdrawn
when
the
superintendent
said
come
in
dear
wife
and
let
me
present
you
to
our
distinguished
guest
a
female
figure
clad
in
black
appeared
on
the
threshold
spare
yet
dignified
serious
yet
friendly
severe
and
yet
kindhearted
this
lady
seemed
admirably
adapted
to
preside
unostentatiously
at
unions
and
mother
meetings
and
to
take
the
place
of
honour
with
quiet
beside
the
wives
of
the
landed
gentry
on
her
head
she
wore
a
black
cap
scarcely
larger
than
half
a
crown
two
wide
ribbons
floated
over
her
ears
to
her
shoulders
heightening
the
impression
her
personality
made
of
unassuming
solemnity
the
superintendent
introduced
her
to
leo
the
hand
she
offered
him
was
grey
and
bony
as
a
labouring
woman
and
the
fingers
ploughed
with
it
was
reported
that
this
hand
had
scattered
blessings
for
miles
round
you
are
welcome
herr
von
sellenthin
she
said
with
a
stiff
bow
and
then
turning
to
her
husband
she
added
in
a
low
voice
shall
i
send
in
the
yes
by
all
means
send
them
in
he
replied
after
a
reflection
with
the
same
air
of
friendly
composure
with
which
he
had
been
dealing
with
the
salvation
of
leo
soul
the
two
men
were
again
alone
the
clergyman
offered
leo
cigars
pale
yellow
cigars
which
smouldered
slightly
and
he
himself
lit
a
long
pipe
they
discussed
the
affairs
of
the
neighbourhood
and
topics
of
the
hour
in
a
calm
way
the
harvest
the
increase
of
pauperism
and
the
strike
in
saxony
which
threatened
even
here
to
become
a
social
evil
and
thus
they
came
to
speak
of
the
parish
of
wengern
the
superintendent
smiled
your
deceased
father
he
said
filled
the
cure
there
with
a
queer
sort
of
fellow
it
would
be
possible
for
the
law
of
sanction
is
exercised
much
more
rigidly
than
it
used
to
be
i
will
confess
to
you
that
more
than
once
i
have
prevented
a
storm
bursting
over
his
head
for
the
consistory
would
be
glad
to
have
done
with
him
he
is
only
saved
by
his
orthodoxy
and
the
strict
morality
he
preaches
if
half
of
his
were
known
he
would
long
ago
have
got
his
dismissal
and
you
as
his
superior
tolerate
him
asked
leo
yes
dear
herr
von
sellenthin
how
shall
i
express
it
it
lies
in
the
weakness
of
the
human
heart
that
a
man
sometimes
ca
do
what
he
ought
i
believe
that
the
pastor
has
eight
children
i
have
only
five
peter
is
the
rock
on
which
the
church
stands
but
it
also
has
its
john
why
should
one
not
take
john
for
a
model
so
long
as
one
is
a
member
of
the
consistory
leo
pressed
the
simple
man
hand
in
gratitude
and
then
you
know
herr
von
sellenthin
that
in
conference
pastor
brenckenberg
is
the
only
man
who
has
what
at
the
university
we
called
it
a
funny
thing
what
becomes
of
those
ideas
when
we
were
young
we
all
had
them
in
abundance
but
they
diminished
as
we
grew
older
and
now
one
hardly
knows
what
they
are
like
when
one
comes
across
them
in
another
they
are
apt
to
irritate
at
first
but
finally
one
feels
that
they
do
good
therefore
i
suffer
brenckenberg
gladly
in
our
midst
and
besides
that
herr
von
sellenthin
there
is
a
homely
saying
which
i
have
often
found
true
and
which
may
apply
even
to
your
case
it
is
that
the
majority
of
things
are
not
so
bad
as
they
seem
you
will
ask
what
about
the
deadly
sins
god
knows
they
exist
in
plenty
seven
of
them
the
scripture
says
but
the
main
point
is
this
why
did
the
saviour
die
on
the
cross
if
we
were
to
despair
in
our
sins
either
that
death
seems
to
us
an
act
of
folly
which
god
forbid
or
we
believe
in
it
even
as
a
miracle
which
every
day
of
our
lives
is
worked
anew
and
which
will
be
worked
especially
for
you
my
dear
friend
filled
with
his
harmonious
views
of
life
he
waved
his
cup
to
and
fro
complacently
to
stir
up
the
sugar
in
the
dregs
of
his
leo
rose
to
take
his
leave
this
man
so
inoffensive
that
one
help
liking
him
was
not
the
priest
that
his
soul
needed
so
he
hurried
away
as
much
without
comfort
as
he
had
come
he
felt
as
if
he
could
have
shaken
the
dust
of
that
home
of
peace
from
his
feet
only
there
was
no
dust
there
to
shake
he
drove
through
the
rainy
twilight
towards
uhlenfelde
night
had
fallen
before
he
drew
up
at
its
closed
gates
his
horse
splashed
in
a
pool
of
water
and
a
of
raindrops
trickled
on
him
from
the
leafless
branches
which
flanked
the
road
he
would
have
got
down
to
pull
the
bell
but
a
numbness
which
had
overtaken
him
made
him
set
still
instead
and
stare
in
front
of
him
the
stood
there
like
a
pair
of
black
hounds
on
their
hind
legs
glowering
at
each
other
to
right
and
left
a
piece
of
the
wall
crept
out
into
the
night
the
rest
was
hidden
by
the
darkness
only
from
the
castle
came
one
pale
path
of
light
it
was
the
lamp
burning
in
the
bay
where
ulrich
stood
it
shimmered
towards
him
along
the
damp
undergrowth
of
the
park
which
stood
out
of
the
darkness
here
and
there
in
mirrorlike
patches
as
if
it
wished
to
guide
him
to
the
place
which
he
hesitated
to
approach
but
the
further
it
penetrated
the
fainter
became
the
light
till
at
last
it
was
powerless
to
withstand
the
which
swallowed
it
leo
felt
an
icy
shiver
pass
through
his
drenched
body
there
is
the
priest
i
want
he
thought
the
only
one
on
earth
who
can
save
me
but
of
what
avail
were
these
weak
longings
he
would
only
stand
before
him
as
always
biting
his
lips
his
frightened
glance
wandering
along
the
walls
a
martyr
to
nervous
fears
and
yearning
his
ears
strained
to
hear
if
a
gliding
step
was
coming
along
the
corridor
the
step
of
one
who
would
sweeten
his
distress
and
destroy
his
hope
what
object
would
there
be
in
coming
here
if
he
did
not
confess
and
repent
his
whip
cracked
the
horse
stamped
as
he
turned
round
in
the
spluttering
water
through
which
the
wheels
ploughed
with
a
creaking
sound
he
gave
a
last
look
full
of
impotent
rage
and
dull
painful
longing
at
the
peaceable
stream
of
light
which
like
everything
else
in
the
world
served
only
to
reproach
him
and
then
he
drove
furiously
back
by
the
way
he
had
come
still
faintly
hoping
for
what
now
was
hopeless
the
next
morning
the
rain
had
ceased
a
pale
sunlight
broken
up
by
the
drifting
masses
of
cloud
for
several
minutes
and
then
gliding
down
on
to
the
yellow
plain
illumined
the
larches
and
threw
a
sort
of
lantern
reflection
on
the
variegated
walls
of
the
outlying
forest
leo
drove
as
he
had
done
on
the
previous
day
alone
to
church
this
time
he
preceded
instead
of
following
his
party
for
he
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
at
the
outset
by
johanna
grim
scrutiny
his
soul
was
now
busy
with
a
host
of
happy
plans
and
pious
resolves
an
old
glimmer
of
his
joyous
childhood
faith
had
awakened
in
him
again
he
would
humbly
lay
down
the
burden
of
his
sins
at
the
foot
of
god
throne
and
receive
the
pardon
which
the
lord
held
in
readiness
for
him
with
quiet
thankfulness
it
pained
him
to
think
of
the
ferocity
of
his
mood
he
had
stretched
out
the
greedy
hand
of
a
thief
to
snatch
redemption
to
obtain
heaven
greatest
blessing
in
an
embittered
and
obstinate
spirit
but
it
was
coming
to
him
unbidden
the
november
wind
was
like
a
divine
breath
against
his
heated
brow
the
faint
sunlight
poured
a
wealth
of
gold
on
his
head
the
miracle
is
beginning
to
work
he
thought
but
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
crouched
still
the
demon
of
fear
and
would
not
budge
the
fear
of
meeting
her
if
only
he
could
have
gone
alone
to
the
altar
but
wherever
he
went
she
was
there
also
from
her
there
was
no
escape
in
the
same
way
as
she
stood
between
him
and
his
friend
she
stood
between
him
and
his
god
the
uhlenfelde
barouche
was
close
in
front
of
his
as
he
turned
into
the
church
square
there
she
was
that
graceful
creature
descending
the
steps
of
the
carriage
with
a
dainty
swing
of
her
rustling
skirts
was
the
woman
he
would
have
liked
at
that
moment
to
take
in
his
giant
arms
and
crush
crush
like
a
ball
of
putty
he
pressed
his
nails
deep
into
his
flesh
at
the
thought
of
how
easy
it
would
be
to
do
it
ulrich
slightly
yellower
than
usual
and
with
more
brilliant
eyes
than
usual
came
up
to
him
on
his
legs
you
left
me
in
the
lurch
yesterday
he
said
in
mild
reproach
it
was
too
late
to
come
in
apologised
leo
i
was
afraid
i
should
not
get
the
trap
over
the
ferry
pity
replied
ulrich
i
wanted
you
dreadfully
for
anything
special
i
wanted
a
father
confessor
ulrich
said
smiling
and
i
was
to
be
thought
leo
grinding
his
teeth
meanwhile
he
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
felicitas
who
was
arranging
her
veil
and
hair
and
ribbons
behind
the
carriage
and
seemed
in
desperate
need
of
a
mirror
she
is
going
to
god
almighty
he
reflected
and
anger
possessed
him
in
every
limb
as
he
thought
how
he
loathed
her
then
he
went
to
offer
her
his
hand
her
eyes
swimming
in
tears
looked
up
at
him
in
sweet
entreaty
through
the
thick
veil
she
wore
she
pressed
his
hand
twice
in
hers
a
signal
of
freemasonry
between
them
hatefully
reminiscent
to
him
of
their
mutual
sin
a
few
minutes
later
his
own
people
drove
up
they
were
all
in
black
mamma
lips
were
rounded
from
sheer
pious
ecstasy
and
elly
who
seemed
strikingly
to
resemble
her
wore
the
expression
we
have
all
fasted
leo
mother
whispered
to
him
full
of
pride
hertha
was
very
pale
and
studiously
avoided
locking
at
him
johanna
who
appeared
terribly
aged
and
haggard
suddenly
came
and
asked
him
to
let
her
take
his
arm
he
acquiesced
in
amazement
for
such
a
thing
had
not
happened
since
he
came
home
this
coming
to
the
holy
sacrament
is
my
doing
she
said
in
a
low
tone
so
i
thought
he
replied
and
do
you
guess
what
my
object
is
in
doing
it
i
think
that
i
can
it
is
designed
above
all
things
to
perfect
the
reconciliation
between
us
two
and
what
more
ca
yourself
tell
you
their
eyes
met
in
bitter
hostility
leo
well
is
it
not
well
that
it
should
be
so
oh
yes
it
an
excellent
idea
really
beautiful
ha
ha
ha
the
others
who
had
walked
on
looked
round
this
outburst
of
hilarity
was
not
in
keeping
with
the
sacramental
mood
at
due
door
of
the
vestry
he
dropped
his
aster
arm
and
avoided
speaking
to
her
again
the
superintendent
was
sitting
at
his
official
table
peaceably
conning
his
sermon
leo
went
to
him
and
spoke
a
few
words
of
greeting
with
a
furtive
smile
of
understanding
the
good
man
grasped
both
his
hands
as
much
as
to
say
you
and
i
we
know
all
about
it
ah
if
only
you
know
thought
leo
in
bitter
irony
and
then
once
more
he
found
himself
searching
for
an
excuse
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
sweet
accursed
woman
who
man
oe
uvred
without
ceasing
to
take
her
place
at
his
side
how
was
it
possible
to
collect
one
thoughts
for
reverence
and
devotion
as
long
as
that
white
throat
with
its
double
dimple
was
craning
itself
amorously
in
his
direction
in
the
church
they
sat
in
the
same
order
as
they
had
done
on
the
previous
day
leo
with
his
mother
and
elly
in
the
first
row
behind
ulrich
and
felicitas
while
johanna
and
hertha
withdrew
to
the
third
bench
every
seat
in
the
church
was
full
on
the
plain
altar
covered
with
a
red
cloth
two
wax
candles
burned
in
the
sconces
according
to
the
custom
on
communion
days
the
building
with
its
grey
choir
and
galleries
its
painted
pillars
and
bare
whitewashed
ceiling
enclosed
in
its
bald
dreary
spaciousness
countless
black
rows
of
melancholy
human
worshippers
only
the
reflection
from
the
window
made
a
feeble
effort
to
cast
a
little
colour
and
character
into
the
drab
monotony
and
over
the
altar
niche
shone
brighter
it
seemed
than
before
the
words
which
promised
such
volumes
peace
be
with
you
peace
peace
at
any
price
yet
was
it
not
further
off
than
ever
the
sense
of
the
fatal
woman
nearness
was
making
all
his
pulses
sting
and
throb
and
while
the
sermon
proceeded
like
a
tinkling
brass
on
a
tinkling
cymbal
he
sat
hunched
up
leaning
forward
against
the
trying
to
follow
an
idea
and
looking
out
for
allusions
which
he
could
not
grasp
for
all
his
suspicion
suddenly
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
and
proud
memories
began
to
flash
through
his
brain
he
saw
himself
galloping
across
the
prairie
on
his
wild
arab
he
heard
the
sounds
of
mad
revelry
round
the
camp
fires
at
night
his
own
laugh
that
of
his
drunken
comrades
and
he
scented
the
mud
vapour
rising
from
the
rushing
leviathan
rivers
which
he
had
forded
many
a
time
on
his
horse
back
a
very
different
motto
had
ruled
that
merry
life
then
repent
nothing
had
been
written
in
sunbeams
on
his
heart
repent
nothing
had
cried
the
voice
of
the
tempest
and
the
laughter
of
his
mistresses
and
everything
that
had
language
but
now
the
autumn
wind
moaned
against
the
leaden
casements
of
the
church
windows
it
made
a
sort
of
plaintive
whimpering
melody
almost
like
the
whimper
of
a
penitent
soul
and
when
a
faint
ray
of
sunshine
found
its
way
into
the
gloomy
edifice
it
pointed
at
once
a
didactic
finger
at
the
words
which
held
out
hopes
of
a
churchyard
solace
peace
be
with
you
he
stretched
his
limbs
and
leaned
back
and
as
he
did
so
he
heard
behind
him
scarcely
a
foot
from
his
ear
a
low
soft
bitter
weeping
such
weeping
as
comes
only
from
the
heart
of
little
children
or
women
he
shuddered
a
wave
of
stupid
pity
which
made
him
vexed
with
himself
passed
over
him
and
seemed
to
soften
him
towards
her
in
another
moment
he
would
have
turned
round
to
whisper
a
word
of
comfort
but
then
ulrich
voice
was
heard
saying
in
affectionate
remonstrance
pull
yourself
together
dear
child
and
at
the
sound
leo
became
frozen
again
but
the
sobbing
continued
tender
and
ingratiating
like
an
question
it
got
on
his
nerves
and
penetrated
to
his
soul
oh
that
i
might
be
left
in
peace
a
voice
within
him
cried
alone
with
my
god
but
the
woman
was
there
and
there
she
would
stay
sucking
from
his
heart
with
her
sobs
all
his
calmness
and
strength
of
purpose
leo
his
mother
whispered
warningly
in
his
ear
what
is
it
stand
up
it
the
bidding
prayer
he
dragged
himself
on
to
his
feet
the
voice
of
the
superintendent
came
from
the
chancel
in
a
subdued
jesus
bread
of
life
grant
that
we
come
to
this
thy
table
not
in
vain
or
to
the
injury
of
our
soul
let
us
hope
so
thought
leo
and
a
desperate
doubt
as
to
his
own
worthiness
shot
sharply
through
him
the
first
service
was
over
and
the
stream
of
worshippers
moved
towards
the
doors
only
the
communicants
stayed
in
their
places
felicitas
kept
her
head
buried
in
her
but
the
rebellious
little
rings
of
gold
hair
on
her
forehead
could
be
seen
glittering
through
her
crape
veil
ulrich
seemed
to
be
lost
in
deepest
meditation
then
as
he
met
leo
glance
his
face
cleared
he
blinked
twice
with
his
short
tired
lids
and
infinite
affection
and
confidence
radiated
from
beneath
them
the
church
had
emptied
itself
the
minister
in
front
of
the
altar
and
read
the
prayer
of
invitation
from
a
large
flat
book
which
he
moved
to
and
fro
in
his
hands
then
he
lifted
the
folded
serviette
from
the
sacred
vessels
which
were
set
out
on
the
corner
of
the
altar
every
one
rose
to
draw
near
the
lord
table
the
altar
was
surrounded
by
a
balustrade
covered
with
red
baize
and
at
the
foot
there
was
a
praying
stool
leo
without
lifting
his
eyes
offered
his
arm
to
his
mother
and
walked
with
her
leading
elly
on
the
other
side
up
the
steps
of
the
choir
ulrich
and
his
wife
followed
close
behind
johanna
and
her
hung
back
a
few
paces
hertha
bit
her
veil
and
clung
to
her
mother
arm
at
the
bottom
step
she
reeled
and
nearly
fell
they
knelt
down
on
the
circular
stool
to
leo
left
were
two
vacant
places
and
ulrich
was
on
the
point
of
taking
the
one
next
him
when
at
the
last
moment
felicitas
letting
go
her
husband
arm
pushed
herself
between
the
two
men
leo
perspired
with
horror
he
felt
as
if
he
must
spring
up
and
flee
but
that
would
never
have
done
he
dare
move
an
inch
and
was
forced
to
submit
quietly
to
her
skirts
overlapping
him
and
the
upper
part
of
her
arm
resting
warmly
against
his
the
administering
of
the
sacrament
began
take
and
eat
this
is
my
body
two
lean
apparently
interminable
fingers
on
one
of
which
flashed
a
came
in
contact
with
leo
mouth
he
took
the
sacred
morsel
and
thought
at
least
i
shall
not
share
that
with
her
the
minister
went
on
murmuring
as
he
gave
the
bread
to
each
the
portion
of
a
sentence
which
was
given
for
you
do
this
in
memory
of
me
and
as
there
were
fifteen
people
gathered
round
the
altar
at
the
same
time
he
began
again
take
and
eat
this
is
my
body
leo
gazed
fixedly
at
the
silver
embroidered
cross
in
the
middle
of
the
he
could
almost
have
counted
the
threads
it
seemed
so
near
on
the
bottom
part
of
it
there
was
a
spot
of
grease
which
dimmed
its
lustre
perhaps
it
too
is
blood
leo
thought
the
arm
that
pressed
against
him
began
to
tremble
as
if
it
wanted
the
pressure
returned
at
that
moment
the
minister
took
hold
of
the
chalice
and
lifted
it
high
above
his
head
a
ray
of
sun
shining
through
the
painted
window
was
reflected
in
the
golden
body
of
the
cup
and
it
flashed
forth
a
bluish
flame
take
this
and
drink
the
cup
was
being
held
to
ulrich
lips
this
is
my
blood
and
now
it
was
felicitas
who
was
drinking
from
it
she
is
drinking
my
blood
too
thought
leo
with
a
slight
swing
the
cup
was
withdrawn
from
her
and
it
approached
his
own
mouth
a
dark
mist
blinded
him
the
sharp
edge
as
it
knocked
against
his
teeth
was
still
warm
from
lips
which
had
just
rested
on
it
the
pungent
wine
was
flowing
into
his
mouth
and
with
a
shudder
he
swallowed
it
then
in
a
lightning
flash
he
saw
what
he
had
done
he
had
eaten
and
drunk
damnation
and
he
deserved
to
be
cast
out
for
ever
from
the
community
of
christians
for
in
drinking
the
sacred
blood
he
had
drunk
her
kisses
xxix
winter
came
suddenly
in
the
first
days
of
december
the
world
lay
hidden
in
snow
and
the
ruts
of
the
roads
wound
over
the
great
white
plain
like
black
ribbons
a
sky
resembling
a
smoky
ceiling
hung
low
over
the
earth
and
the
twilight
of
night
seemed
to
fall
before
the
day
had
properly
begun
the
months
from
december
to
march
are
as
a
rule
a
period
of
rest
and
recreation
for
the
country
squire
he
is
now
at
liberty
to
enjoy
social
pleasures
take
trips
to
the
capital
or
travel
in
italy
he
may
drink
and
gamble
or
if
his
tastes
are
cultured
he
can
order
from
his
bookseller
the
latest
novels
and
the
newest
sensation
in
current
literature
but
none
of
these
things
had
any
attraction
for
leo
he
did
care
to
associate
with
the
neighbouring
families
for
he
knew
that
matchmaking
mammas
regard
him
as
a
catch
he
was
sick
of
travelling
it
would
have
been
a
herculean
task
to
get
drunk
as
he
required
so
much
to
bring
about
that
happy
condition
and
at
monte
carlo
he
had
played
so
high
that
his
empty
coffers
as
a
memorial
of
his
losses
warned
him
against
further
gaming
as
for
reading
he
had
neither
the
taste
nor
the
powers
of
concentration
necessary
for
enjoying
it
even
the
consolation
of
sport
was
denied
him
for
the
big
game
of
the
prairies
had
spoilt
him
for
partridge
shooting
nothing
remained
but
to
do
what
turned
up
next
and
to
amuse
himself
according
to
the
whim
of
the
moment
and
all
the
time
longing
devoured
him
yes
he
could
no
more
hide
it
from
himself
he
longed
for
her
he
had
not
met
her
since
the
ceremony
of
taking
the
sacrament
afterwards
he
had
torn
away
as
if
hunted
by
demons
without
shaking
ulrich
hand
without
heeding
his
people
looks
of
hurt
surprise
he
had
wanted
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
perfume
that
she
exhaled
away
from
the
questioning
eye
of
his
friend
away
from
the
house
of
god
whose
gift
of
grace
had
been
transformed
for
him
into
a
curse
for
whoso
eateth
and
drinketh
unworthily
eateth
and
drinketh
his
own
damnation
so
ran
the
text
in
the
bible
which
he
had
once
learnt
at
school
and
which
now
was
brought
home
to
him
with
such
terrifying
force
gradually
however
he
had
come
to
a
calmer
state
of
mind
religious
brooding
was
so
foreign
to
his
nature
that
he
succeeded
in
throwing
off
the
consciousness
of
being
damned
eternally
and
yet
on
that
day
he
had
lost
his
last
hold
on
his
old
will
henceforth
he
lay
more
or
less
under
the
ban
of
a
dull
depression
which
threatened
to
build
a
barrier
between
him
and
his
ulrich
had
been
in
berlin
a
month
and
during
that
month
leo
had
not
set
foot
in
uhlenfelde
do
go
near
her
was
now
as
it
had
been
five
months
ago
the
upshot
of
his
wisest
reflections
but
the
resolve
which
then
had
had
its
foundation
in
a
courageous
and
vigorous
character
was
now
prompted
by
weakness
and
fear
he
avoided
too
associating
with
any
of
the
inmates
of
his
house
except
at
meals
he
saw
plainly
how
much
they
were
estranged
from
him
johanna
scarcely
noticed
him
elly
was
frightened
of
him
and
hertha
defiant
even
his
beloved
old
mother
had
no
longer
the
heart
to
force
him
into
conversation
never
indeed
had
there
been
a
sadder
advent
time
at
halewitz
the
sixteenth
of
december
had
always
been
a
high
in
the
annals
of
the
county
gentry
for
it
was
frau
von
stolt
birthday
she
did
not
send
out
invitations
but
took
it
as
a
personal
insult
if
people
did
not
come
on
that
day
without
leo
felt
that
he
would
be
bound
to
put
in
an
appearance
at
stoltenhof
or
risk
a
feud
with
his
neighbours
he
did
not
expect
that
would
be
there
as
ulrich
was
still
away
but
at
the
bare
possibility
his
heart
seemed
to
jump
into
his
throat
there
was
a
scurrying
up
and
down
the
corridors
banging
of
doors
without
end
for
the
two
chicks
were
going
to
their
first
dance
so
the
whole
household
was
in
a
fever
of
excitement
at
dusk
grandmamma
came
into
leo
study
her
bosom
bristling
with
pins
wo
you
for
once
drive
with
us
dear
son
she
asked
no
johanna
is
not
going
still
i
say
no
leo
with
her
hands
folded
and
gulping
back
her
tears
she
came
and
stood
close
to
him
what
is
it
mother
leo
are
you
ill
no
he
fixed
on
her
a
morose
and
vacant
gaze
have
we
offended
you
leo
no
have
you
the
least
bit
of
love
left
for
me
he
saw
her
pleading
eyes
her
quivering
lips
and
for
a
moment
he
was
moved
to
sorrow
but
the
rising
emotion
was
extinguished
instantly
like
a
lighted
match
in
a
leave
me
alone
he
said
i
want
nothing
but
to
live
in
my
own
way
and
not
to
be
too
intimate
with
any
one
and
he
turned
his
back
she
stroked
his
sleeve
twice
thrice
and
with
this
timid
endearment
slipped
quietly
away
the
next
moment
he
heard
her
scolding
the
lady
maid
because
she
had
not
ironed
a
strip
of
tulle
properly
fortunately
things
do
go
very
deeply
with
her
he
thought
and
then
he
was
filled
with
disgust
at
his
own
conduct
was
he
going
to
sacrifice
his
mother
too
to
that
nameless
ghost
of
the
past
the
big
covered
sleigh
came
round
at
seven
and
half
an
hour
later
he
followed
it
in
a
small
sleigh
with
one
horse
as
usual
driving
himself
a
pale
moonlight
illumined
the
white
expanse
of
snow
from
which
the
peasants
huts
and
rose
in
shapeless
masses
of
shadow
the
distance
was
enshrouded
in
a
milky
haze
setting
the
groups
of
trees
in
silver
the
road
lay
on
this
side
of
the
river
but
passed
through
wengern
and
close
by
the
ferry
two
sleighs
belonging
to
distinguished
company
had
just
been
deposited
here
as
he
came
up
and
he
heard
the
music
of
their
bells
as
they
rattled
on
ahead
of
him
he
would
have
known
the
tone
of
the
uhlenfelde
amongst
a
thousand
and
he
was
satisfied
that
they
were
not
amongst
these
would
she
be
there
would
she
be
there
and
he
stretched
himself
for
he
was
stiff
and
cramped
with
suspense
but
when
he
reached
the
stables
certainty
awaited
him
there
stood
the
kletzingks
old
wilhelm
touching
his
cap
to
him
with
the
familiar
grin
which
is
permissible
from
the
servants
of
a
friendly
house
it
occurred
to
him
that
after
all
ulrich
might
have
come
too
and
the
thought
filled
him
with
alarm
he
would
have
liked
to
ask
but
an
undefinable
feeling
of
shame
stifled
the
words
in
his
throat
then
he
slowly
walked
to
the
house
the
castle
of
stoltenhof
resembled
a
camp
the
hall
was
arranged
with
booths
and
like
a
fair
and
civil
and
military
uniforms
moved
about
in
the
gay
throng
the
officers
of
both
the
münsterberg
and
regiments
were
everywhere
very
active
rendering
the
assistance
which
seemed
too
much
for
the
legs
of
the
more
deliberate
country
junkers
leo
was
met
by
his
host
whose
countenance
with
its
record
of
past
pleasures
was
beaming
with
and
ha
so
you
have
ventured
out
of
your
shell
was
his
shrill
greeting
come
along
come
along
they
are
breaking
their
hearts
for
you
in
the
salon
are
your
boys
there
leo
asked
longing
but
not
daring
to
inquire
for
ulrich
of
course
of
course
the
young
dogs
are
all
there
the
whole
boiling
lot
laying
siege
to
your
fair
cousin
cousin
what
cousin
why
your
cousin
felicitas
naturally
you
lucky
beggar
leo
was
only
too
glad
to
forget
the
relationship
the
reminder
of
it
now
stabbed
him
like
a
knife
and
i
can
assure
you
she
is
in
her
old
form
for
a
long
time
she
seemed
so
altered
and
made
no
disguise
of
being
bored
probably
she
was
grieving
but
since
the
reconciliation
between
your
two
families
she
has
been
herself
again
leo
bit
his
lips
so
they
were
talking
about
that
already
passing
a
number
of
hands
outstretched
to
shake
his
he
made
his
way
to
the
door
of
the
salon
despite
its
ugly
furniture
and
low
smoky
ceiling
with
a
six
branched
zinc
chandelier
it
wore
a
festive
aspect
and
blossomed
like
the
rose
with
youth
and
beauty
a
garland
of
fir
boughs
decorated
with
lights
hid
the
palisade
of
famous
racers
from
view
and
lent
an
unwonted
grace
to
the
usually
severely
utilitarian
apartment
the
fragrance
of
firs
and
the
shimmer
of
gave
a
flavour
of
the
coming
christmas
feast
to
the
whole
picture
the
young
people
were
dancing
with
zeal
to
the
strains
of
a
modest
fiddle
and
piano
his
little
sister
flushed
and
radiant
in
the
arms
of
her
partner
floated
by
and
while
his
eyes
searched
in
burning
eagerness
for
felicitas
they
fell
on
hertha
who
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
in
cool
disdain
and
then
turned
her
back
abruptly
her
dainty
haughtily
poised
little
head
was
unbecomingly
coiffured
and
her
thin
neck
rose
stiffly
from
her
childishly
undeveloped
bosom
she
was
not
looking
her
best
he
would
have
gone
and
spoken
to
her
in
case
the
coldness
between
them
should
be
remarked
when
he
saw
steering
towards
him
the
mountainous
form
of
the
lady
of
the
house
whose
hand
he
had
come
to
kiss
you
should
really
take
a
little
more
care
of
our
fair
felicitas
dear
von
sellethin
she
said
accepting
his
respectful
salute
with
gracious
condescension
leo
wondered
what
she
meant
for
there
was
an
undertone
of
distinct
displeasure
in
her
voice
your
friend
is
away
she
continued
and
i
believe
that
next
to
him
you
are
responsible
excuse
my
speaking
so
openly
but
since
i
had
the
happiness
to
bring
about
the
reconciliation
between
you
i
feel
that
i
may
without
offence
claim
the
rights
of
friendship
too
please
be
a
little
more
explicit
my
dear
madame
oh
there
is
nothing
to
explain
i
only
would
hint
that
she
needs
an
eye
over
her
we
all
know
she
is
a
bit
of
a
flirt
in
a
harmless
way
of
course
but
she
may
be
guilty
of
indiscretions
which
might
be
exaggerated
by
mischievous
tongues
and
i
have
no
desire
that
a
fresh
scandal
shall
take
its
rise
under
my
roof
his
feelings
were
of
mingled
alarm
and
relief
no
one
suspected
what
had
once
excited
suspicion
had
been
forgiven
and
forgotten
madame
put
my
mind
at
rest
in
heaven
name
and
tell
me
going
on
nothing
very
bad
but
come
and
see
for
yourself
she
led
him
through
the
crowd
of
dancing
couples
to
a
small
dimly
lighted
by
pink
chinese
lanterns
where
the
windows
were
thrown
open
it
being
the
first
cooling
retreat
from
the
ballroom
felicitas
was
sitting
directly
in
the
icy
draught
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
admirers
who
filled
with
noise
and
laughter
the
retiring
place
in
which
they
had
no
business
to
be
as
they
ought
to
have
been
dancing
leo
saw
and
his
wrath
rose
so
fiercely
that
at
first
he
could
scarcely
breathe
here
is
another
friend
of
yours
my
dearest
said
frau
von
stolt
before
she
went
away
now
your
will
be
completely
consoled
leo
felt
that
this
was
a
thrust
at
himself
as
well
as
her
and
he
grew
still
more
furious
friend
brother
and
cousin
rolled
into
one
cried
felicitas
holding
out
her
ungloved
left
hand
to
him
why
has
your
majesty
not
been
seen
for
such
ages
you
will
catch
cold
felicitas
was
his
answer
do
fuss
my
friend
but
give
your
lion
paw
to
these
young
men
and
be
a
lizzie
wild
team
as
they
entitled
themselves
with
pride
were
all
there
otzen
krassow
zesslingen
and
neuheim
and
the
two
soldier
sons
of
the
house
of
course
it
had
all
been
in
vain
then
the
sacrifice
of
his
manliness
the
plunge
into
a
maze
of
lies
and
deceit
she
had
reopened
the
undignified
flirtation
with
these
silly
boys
without
troubling
herself
about
his
opinion
he
might
have
spared
himself
everything
all
the
long
anguish
beginning
on
the
isle
of
friendship
that
september
morning
and
culminating
on
the
altar
steps
the
other
day
a
red
haze
dimmed
his
sight
the
invariable
signal
of
one
of
his
most
furious
outbursts
pull
yourself
together
an
inward
voice
commanded
he
realised
that
in
any
passage
of
arms
with
these
youths
he
must
be
worsted
as
she
apparently
was
oblivious
of
any
harm
being
done
so
he
shook
hands
with
them
and
then
said
very
firmly
you
know
felicitas
how
careful
ulrich
is
of
your
health
i
can
not
stand
by
and
see
you
catch
your
death
take
my
arm
she
dared
not
refuse
for
she
dreaded
a
serious
remonstrance
on
his
part
she
got
up
and
laying
her
hand
on
the
arm
of
the
younger
stolt
she
said
he
who
is
my
cavalier
must
try
to
be
my
master
too
dear
leo
come
fritz
and
let
us
dance
she
curtsied
and
with
her
feet
already
beating
time
to
the
music
of
the
waltz
she
rustled
past
him
never
mind
sellenthin
said
young
zesslingen
naïvely
she
treats
us
worse
than
that
even
to
the
rage
of
mothers
and
the
chagrin
of
sisters
the
troop
of
youths
now
took
up
their
post
at
the
door
of
the
salon
awaiting
the
moment
when
their
charmer
should
stop
to
rest
and
they
be
able
to
rush
to
her
again
as
leo
was
making
his
way
back
to
the
hall
he
encountered
kurt
brenckenberg
mincing
and
smug
with
fresh
on
the
silk
lappets
of
his
he
whistled
indifferently
to
conceal
an
uneasy
conscience
and
made
a
sharp
detour
to
avoid
leo
the
latter
remembered
the
song
of
the
smiling
stars
and
he
beckoned
elly
to
come
and
speak
to
him
for
a
moment
she
flew
from
her
partner
arms
to
his
half
wild
with
triumph
in
her
conquests
look
here
he
said
it
is
my
wish
that
you
do
have
anything
more
to
do
with
the
candidate
brenckenberg
she
looked
blank
at
first
as
if
the
name
had
entirely
escaped
her
memory
candidate
candidate
oh
you
mean
i
have
cut
him
long
ago
dear
leo
you
may
make
your
mind
quite
easy
on
that
score
i
assure
you
and
with
one
of
those
expressions
of
boundless
and
unutterable
contempt
which
very
young
and
ingenuous
ladies
always
know
how
to
command
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
at
the
object
of
her
first
love
who
in
his
mortification
was
biting
the
fingers
of
his
cleaned
white
kid
gloves
having
thus
discharged
a
brotherly
duty
leo
began
to
be
depressed
with
a
sense
of
his
own
superfluity
and
complete
aloofness
from
everybody
around
him
he
felt
and
paralysed
a
dull
fury
smouldered
in
his
heart
which
changed
its
aspect
every
minute
now
it
was
ready
to
break
out
and
commit
murder
then
it
sank
into
an
impotent
passive
gnawing
grief
suddenly
a
light
was
thrown
on
what
ailed
him
and
he
knew
that
this
poison
in
his
veins
meant
jealousy
at
the
discovery
he
laughed
loud
and
bitterly
as
it
happened
the
sound
fell
on
a
silence
and
he
looked
round
horrified
at
what
he
had
done
to
see
a
row
of
astounded
faces
staring
at
him
he
now
became
conscious
for
the
first
time
where
he
was
he
was
sitting
at
the
in
the
hall
in
the
midst
of
friends
and
good
neighbours
with
whom
he
had
scarcely
exchanged
three
words
since
his
they
now
all
fell
upon
him
he
must
not
continue
to
withdraw
himself
from
their
society
they
urged
and
live
the
life
of
a
recluse
and
hermit
what
cares
he
had
brought
with
him
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
they
would
help
to
dispel
while
they
talked
to
him
thus
he
let
his
glance
wander
anxiously
from
one
face
to
the
other
how
many
men
there
were
troubling
themselves
about
his
welfare
men
who
had
the
right
to
give
him
their
tactless
advice
and
yet
how
they
had
all
become
strangers
to
him
and
how
easy
it
was
to
forget
that
they
had
sat
on
the
same
form
with
him
in
school
and
taken
part
in
his
early
escapades
fate
had
laid
a
gulf
between
him
and
them
from
the
other
side
of
which
he
saw
their
features
looming
indistinctly
as
if
from
behind
a
mist
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
asked
them
when
they
had
all
done
speaking
at
once
he
ought
to
come
out
of
his
misanthropic
shell
they
declared
send
his
megrims
to
the
devil
take
his
right
place
in
the
society
of
the
neighbourhood
and
perhaps
look
out
for
a
wife
do
talk
to
me
of
women
he
said
roughly
then
hans
von
sembritzky
sturdy
stout
old
hans
who
of
all
the
boon
companions
of
his
youth
remained
most
congenial
to
him
came
out
with
a
suggestion
he
described
in
glowing
terms
the
social
evenings
which
took
place
two
or
three
times
a
week
at
the
prussian
crown
when
landed
proprietors
officers
and
civilians
foregathered
to
smoke
drink
retail
gossip
and
tell
good
stories
he
would
be
in
his
element
amongst
them
if
only
he
would
come
he
promised
to
make
a
note
of
the
invitation
and
then
to
obliterate
the
impression
of
that
mad
unguarded
laugh
he
made
a
supreme
effort
to
talk
and
monopolized
the
conversation
he
related
some
of
his
adventures
on
the
other
side
and
pictures
of
his
life
there
passed
in
procession
before
his
excited
brain
like
a
recent
dream
a
large
circle
of
admiring
listeners
among
whom
were
ladies
collected
round
him
and
hung
on
his
lips
he
was
charmed
at
his
own
success
and
his
imagination
became
more
and
more
inflamed
he
bubbled
over
with
humorous
anecdote
and
pointed
allusion
and
while
his
voice
echoed
continuously
in
his
ears
his
amazement
at
what
he
was
doing
grew
faces
became
mere
white
specks
he
saw
nothing
distinctly
but
the
carpet
the
copper
and
decanters
of
red
wine
and
all
the
time
beneath
his
triumph
a
voice
kept
crying
useless
useless
for
had
cheated
him
played
with
him
he
who
had
sacrificed
honour
friendship
his
life
happiness
and
hope
everything
for
her
the
man
who
sat
there
telling
tales
of
encounters
with
indians
and
wild
beasts
half
true
half
invented
was
nothing
but
an
automaton
his
memory
flashed
forth
brilliant
pictures
while
his
soul
was
in
torment
in
the
back
row
of
his
listeners
almost
hidden
behind
the
others
he
became
aware
of
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
fixed
on
him
in
mingled
fascination
and
defiance
one
moment
radiant
with
pride
the
next
lowering
with
fear
those
eyes
belonged
to
a
girl
whose
young
heart
was
his
own
in
every
fibre
who
was
capable
of
rejoicing
in
his
joys
more
than
he
did
himself
and
bleeding
for
his
sufferings
and
in
return
he
had
pulverised
her
in
his
rude
grasp
and
spurned
her
the
sad
pity
of
it
all
unnerved
and
unmanned
him
he
lost
the
thread
of
his
reminiscences
his
words
became
confused
i
ca
go
on
he
said
getting
up
i
finish
another
time
the
little
crowd
much
disappointed
scattered
and
he
relapsed
again
into
his
dreary
ruminations
towards
midnight
supper
was
served
on
small
tables
stalls
and
were
now
converted
into
buffets
from
which
each
gentleman
had
to
procure
provisions
for
himself
and
partner
leo
selected
little
meta
sembritzky
as
his
her
small
face
appealed
to
his
sympathy
she
wore
a
very
wide
grey
silk
teagown
which
only
half
hid
her
interesting
condition
their
conversation
flagged
but
they
felt
that
they
were
old
enough
friends
to
understand
each
other
without
mentioning
what
was
uppermost
in
their
minds
nevertheless
leo
was
not
left
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
hans
came
home
very
late
at
night
and
that
was
stricter
than
ever
from
a
table
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
laughter
was
rippling
and
salvoes
of
witticisms
which
drowned
other
people
remarks
and
attracted
universal
attention
there
felicitas
sat
amidst
her
adorers
some
of
these
considered
that
they
had
done
their
duty
by
taking
in
to
supper
raw
young
girls
whom
they
now
entirely
neglected
to
devote
themselves
to
the
fair
mistress
of
uhlenfelde
the
poor
damsels
sat
in
awkward
silence
casting
despairing
glances
at
their
renegade
cavaliers
whose
jokes
with
felicitas
they
could
not
follow
or
appreciate
the
latter
had
defied
the
custom
which
would
have
apportioned
her
to
a
married
man
and
had
come
in
to
supper
on
the
arm
of
young
zesslinger
but
the
young
cuirassiers
had
both
been
sent
to
distant
tables
by
their
indignant
mother
frau
von
sellenthin
looking
regal
in
satin
and
lace
yet
lovable
as
always
towards
the
end
of
supper
crossed
the
hall
with
dignified
step
and
motioned
leo
into
a
corner
for
mercy
sake
she
murmured
do
you
know
what
has
come
over
lizzie
she
is
behaving
scandalously
with
those
stupid
boys
every
one
is
talking
about
it
why
do
you
ask
mother
i
thought
perhaps
you
could
i
can
do
nothing
felicitas
is
mistress
of
her
own
actions
if
she
chooses
to
make
herself
ridiculous
it
is
her
own
and
he
led
her
back
to
her
seat
after
supper
felicitas
came
up
to
him
with
sparkling
eyes
and
cheeks
flushed
from
champagne
and
merriment
gesegnete
mahlzeit
you
she
cried
putting
her
small
soft
hand
into
his
and
shaking
it
with
comical
heartiness
not
by
the
quiver
of
an
eyelash
or
the
trembling
of
a
lip
did
she
betray
that
there
was
any
secret
between
them
every
trace
of
what
had
been
and
was
seemed
erased
from
her
memory
he
replied
to
her
gesegnete
mahlzeit
stiffly
leo
she
went
on
are
you
in
the
humour
for
a
spree
it
depends
on
what
the
spree
is
oh
you
cautious
old
listen
and
i
tell
you
only
you
must
tell
we
are
getting
up
a
midnight
we
who
why
these
boys
and
two
or
three
others
it
to
be
a
after
the
fashion
of
the
king
of
bavaria
you
know
torches
and
outriders
in
mediæval
costume
and
all
the
rest
of
it
unfortunately
there
are
no
mountains
to
risk
breaking
our
necks
over
all
the
same
it
will
be
a
very
affair
as
i
am
to
be
the
only
lady
of
the
party
so
i
thought
if
i
found
a
steady
reliable
person
a
relation
like
yourself
to
come
and
act
as
chaperon
it
would
be
all
right
i
am
honoured
by
the
confidence
you
place
in
me
my
dear
lizzie
he
replied
drawing
himself
erect
but
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
not
nearly
enough
related
to
you
to
undertake
the
you
suggest
without
injury
to
your
reputation
on
the
other
hand
i
am
sufficiently
intimate
with
ulrich
to
call
to
account
those
who
by
taking
part
in
such
a
mad
excursion
would
put
you
so
wantonly
in
a
false
position
three
faces
lengthened
in
dismay
at
his
words
even
felicitas
grew
perceptibly
paler
her
eyes
which
a
moment
before
had
flashed
a
mocking
challenge
at
him
drooped
in
veiled
supplication
he
turned
his
back
on
the
group
and
the
hall
trembling
with
suppressed
emotion
there
he
spent
another
miserable
two
hours
resolving
every
moment
to
go
home
and
yet
incapable
of
tearing
himself
from
the
magic
spell
of
her
environment
he
sat
moping
in
silence
behind
the
broad
back
of
a
apparently
engrossed
in
watching
the
game
and
only
glad
that
no
one
disturbed
him
when
it
was
almost
three
he
heard
one
of
the
young
officers
telling
a
servant
to
order
round
the
uhlenfelde
sleigh
a
swift
decision
made
him
spring
up
take
his
leave
and
rush
to
the
stables
to
see
that
his
own
horse
was
put
in
as
speedily
as
possible
a
clear
cold
moonlight
lay
on
the
white
world
there
was
a
filagree
of
snow
crystals
shimmering
over
the
surface
of
the
fields
as
if
a
crop
of
diamonds
were
sprouting
from
the
sleeping
soil
here
and
there
the
shadows
of
the
trees
dug
dark
patches
in
the
whiteness
no
lights
shone
from
the
farmsteads
and
the
white
slanting
gables
and
long
lines
of
walls
rose
indistinctly
against
the
silvery
distance
his
roan
had
fared
well
as
guest
in
the
stoltenhof
stable
and
would
have
started
at
a
brisk
trot
only
leo
used
force
to
hold
him
in
the
tinkled
lazily
through
the
silence
a
consciousness
of
repose
seemed
to
have
descended
on
the
earth
the
vast
repose
of
deaths
so
dreaded
by
the
living
yet
exercising
so
infinite
a
charm
what
are
you
about
he
questioned
himself
why
do
you
give
the
horse
a
touch
of
the
whip
instead
of
pulling
him
in
tear
home
look
round
do
listen
but
his
eager
ear
continued
on
the
stretch
for
sounds
piercing
the
stillness
of
the
night
behind
him
and
from
time
to
time
he
paused
to
be
certain
that
his
own
bells
were
not
swallowing
the
faint
echo
of
others
he
persuaded
himself
that
it
was
to
sit
in
judgment
on
her
and
to
take
her
to
task
for
her
conduct
that
he
would
see
her
again
that
night
yet
all
the
while
the
miserable
conviction
was
being
borne
in
on
him
that
what
he
thought
was
anger
was
nothing
but
a
longing
passionate
desire
as
he
passed
the
parsonage
at
wengern
dull
resentment
took
possession
of
him
there
the
old
rascal
and
prophet
sleeps
the
sleep
of
the
just
thought
he
while
poor
king
david
is
wandering
alone
through
the
night
he
turned
down
the
slope
to
the
ferry
here
he
could
wait
for
felicitas
without
exciting
notice
for
it
was
only
natural
the
ferry
station
being
on
his
estate
that
he
should
linger
to
see
all
was
in
order
there
the
black
surface
of
the
river
was
shot
with
silver
and
the
ripples
broke
with
a
crunching
grinding
sound
on
the
frozen
banks
his
brought
old
jürgens
out
of
his
bunk
half
asleep
holding
a
lantern
in
a
tremulous
hand
who
the
devil
is
it
he
inquired
not
recognising
leo
in
his
modest
turn
out
do
swear
jürgens
leo
answered
feeling
compassion
for
the
old
man
on
account
of
his
disturbed
slumbers
lord
it
never
the
gnädiger
master
and
he
came
and
kissed
his
and
would
have
taken
hold
of
the
horse
bridle
to
lead
it
down
to
the
when
leo
stopped
him
he
had
only
come
he
explained
to
ascertain
the
condition
of
the
ice
the
music
of
a
faint
and
distant
fell
on
his
ear
leo
heart
bounded
she
was
coming
coming
alone
he
wrenched
off
his
fur
coverings
and
jumping
out
tied
the
horse
reins
to
the
palings
that
surrounded
the
jürgens
chattered
on
with
toothless
garrulity
as
is
the
way
of
old
servitors
the
thickness
of
the
ice
on
the
river
was
nothing
to
speak
of
but
it
would
be
another
inch
or
so
and
by
christmas
it
would
bear
cannons
passing
over
it
this
was
the
best
day
of
all
the
year
for
him
he
had
sometimes
taken
as
much
as
seven
marks
in
tips
so
generous
were
the
friends
of
herr
von
stolt
now
she
must
be
driving
through
the
village
the
sound
was
deadened
by
the
walls
of
the
houses
suddenly
it
broke
forth
clearly
again
and
a
shadow
was
cast
on
the
churchyard
wall
the
sleigh
curved
down
towards
the
stream
hers
was
the
muffled
figure
leaning
back
wearily
in
a
corner
he
approached
the
side
of
the
sleigh
as
the
driver
brought
the
horses
to
a
standstill
she
had
been
asleep
and
did
not
stir
till
the
jerk
of
the
sleigh
halting
roused
her
good
morning
felicitas
she
gave
a
low
cry
and
stretched
out
her
hands
to
him
half
in
fear
half
in
joy
like
a
child
who
is
not
sure
whether
it
is
going
to
be
scolded
or
caressed
do
be
alarmed
he
said
giving
a
significant
glance
at
the
coachman
i
got
out
here
to
see
if
the
ferry
was
all
right
the
river
is
full
of
and
i
am
responsible
for
the
stoltenhof
guests
she
smiled
her
thanks
for
she
understood
his
meaning
i
will
accompany
you
to
the
other
side
he
said
if
you
get
out
we
shall
be
able
to
talk
better
obediently
she
let
him
help
her
out
of
the
sleigh
for
a
moment
he
felt
his
soft
burden
cling
to
him
and
light
as
she
was
she
seemed
to
weigh
him
to
the
earth
the
sleigh
pounded
down
to
the
ferry
and
the
pair
followed
it
in
silence
leo
she
whispered
entreatingly
hush
and
keep
close
to
me
he
replied
forcing
himself
to
speak
severely
and
he
lifted
the
bar
they
stepped
together
on
to
the
shaky
companion
ladder
jutting
narrow
and
slippery
into
the
water
they
were
hardly
separated
from
its
black
depths
by
a
foot
the
rope
covered
with
icicles
shone
like
metal
and
its
frozen
crust
crunched
against
the
wheels
of
the
pulley
leo
she
whispered
again
and
pressed
her
head
against
his
sleeve
now
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
you
an
ugly
word
which
was
suppressed
with
difficulty
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
leo
i
am
desperate
without
you
she
complained
in
a
subdued
tone
why
have
you
forsaken
me
how
can
you
talk
of
forsaking
he
muttered
while
ulrich
is
away
i
ca
come
that
is
all
why
not
how
can
you
ask
but
i
do
ask
we
have
repented
and
confessed
we
have
expiated
our
sin
before
god
and
man
we
know
that
we
are
on
the
right
footing
now
indeed
that
is
how
you
feel
about
it
yes
and
do
you
feel
the
same
she
asked
looking
up
at
him
innocently
his
answer
stuck
in
his
throat
was
it
he
alone
then
who
was
damned
had
god
accepted
her
oblation
and
rejected
his
we
went
to
the
sacrament
together
she
continued
and
thereby
gained
our
souls
salvation
we
ought
now
to
be
quite
sure
of
ourselves
we
ought
to
be
certainly
we
ought
to
be
he
sneered
leo
please
do
be
so
mistrustful
how
can
any
evil
befall
us
if
we
are
sincere
in
following
the
path
of
penitence
we
must
hold
together
if
you
leave
me
to
fight
alone
i
am
powerless
day
after
day
i
have
been
expecting
and
waiting
for
you
every
morning
i
have
got
up
with
the
question
on
my
lips
he
come
and
then
i
have
hoped
for
the
morrow
and
again
for
the
morrow
and
so
i
have
gone
on
oh
how
long
the
time
has
seemed
my
life
has
been
sad
and
monotonous
and
finally
i
was
driven
to
despair
and
said
to
myself
he
gives
you
up
you
must
give
yourself
up
and
so
i
began
the
old
nonsense
again
with
those
boys
i
have
turned
their
heads
and
let
them
pay
me
attentions
and
a
devil
possessed
me
and
i
thought
just
show
him
that
i
can
do
without
him
but
all
the
time
my
heart
was
heavy
and
i
was
crying
out
to
you
in
my
soul
but
you
were
so
hard
and
cruel
that
i
was
forced
to
go
on
playing
my
part
a
strange
sensation
of
content
suffused
his
limbs
he
felt
as
if
a
dead
weight
had
fallen
from
them
he
felt
wholesomely
tired
and
could
have
stretched
himself
out
on
the
spot
and
fallen
asleep
and
now
you
send
those
youths
to
the
right
about
he
asked
leo
yes
or
no
with
the
greatest
pleasure
in
the
world
if
you
will
come
and
see
me
again
but
if
i
do
come
she
hung
her
head
in
utter
discouragement
then
i
ca
say
what
i
shall
do
she
stammered
when
do
you
expect
ulrich
home
he
asked
to
divert
her
ah
ulrich
she
exclaimed
quickly
in
every
one
of
his
letters
he
has
inquired
after
you
and
sent
messages
some
he
has
addressed
to
us
both
but
i
have
dared
write
to
him
because
i
have
seen
you
and
what
would
he
think
if
he
knew
you
had
been
once
that
true
enough
he
said
and
thought
to
himself
that
even
the
most
trustful
person
would
be
struck
by
such
extraordinary
conduct
then
he
repeated
his
question
as
to
when
ulrich
was
coming
back
the
reichstag
separates
for
the
recess
either
or
the
day
after
she
answered
but
it
is
very
uncertain
whether
he
will
be
here
by
christmas
he
has
been
chosen
president
of
a
committee
for
some
agricultural
exhibition
i
believe
and
he
will
be
obliged
to
give
up
part
of
the
parliamentary
recess
to
arrange
matters
he
told
me
to
ask
you
if
he
should
reserve
a
place
for
you
on
the
committee
and
thinks
for
the
sake
of
your
reputation
you
should
accept
shame
kept
him
silent
whether
from
far
or
near
ulrich
hand
was
ever
held
out
to
him
in
loving
helpful
friendship
he
was
a
fool
so
to
underrate
his
own
strength
of
mind
surely
leo
sellenthin
could
never
be
capable
of
the
infamy
of
which
he
had
been
standing
in
such
nameless
dread
you
will
come
wo
you
she
implored
yes
he
answered
with
prompt
decision
soon
yes
soon
he
hesitated
that
would
look
too
much
like
passionate
haste
i
am
engaged
at
knutzendorf
he
replied
beg
off
no
leo
she
urged
reproachfully
would
you
have
me
neglect
my
duties
god
forbid
but
remember
till
you
set
foot
across
my
threshold
not
a
minute
will
go
by
without
my
expecting
you
the
companion
ladder
was
let
down
they
struck
the
opposite
bank
and
the
bar
crunched
on
its
frozen
hinges
their
hands
met
in
a
clinging
grasp
which
it
seemed
as
though
only
force
could
separate
then
they
let
go
of
each
other
with
a
start
he
settled
her
in
her
seat
and
wrapped
the
furs
about
her
the
horse
moved
on
the
bells
began
to
tinkle
and
the
sleigh
melted
into
the
grey
distance
like
a
silver
phantom
the
ferry
raft
gurgled
back
into
the
water
and
old
jürgens
breathed
heavily
as
he
pulled
his
steering
strings
swished
in
the
air
like
a
leo
leaning
against
the
side
listened
to
the
dying
echo
of
the
the
moon
was
waning
the
split
against
the
wide
keel
of
the
boat
xxx
my
dear
mamma
nearly
all
the
boys
are
going
home
for
christmas
erich
froben
will
stay
here
because
he
has
no
mamma
and
fritz
lawsky
because
he
has
only
a
guardian
and
who
comes
from
india
and
is
as
yellow
as
a
gruyére
cheese
all
the
other
boys
are
going
home
why
may
i
come
home
some
of
them
have
a
longer
journey
to
their
homes
than
i
have
oh
i
do
want
to
come
home
so
badly
i
cry
every
morning
and
every
night
because
i
may
not
come
home
there
are
six
days
to
christmas
now
there
is
going
to
be
a
party
and
the
boys
who
stay
here
for
christmas
will
get
their
parcels
of
presents
when
the
tree
is
lit
up
and
a
bell
is
rung
the
school
bell
if
will
get
something
too
for
the
head
wrote
to
his
papa
who
said
he
would
send
his
presents
over
in
a
ship
have
you
got
my
list
of
the
things
i
want
perhaps
it
has
got
lost
that
would
be
awful
but
i
write
another
list
to
make
sure
list
of
presents
a
big
box
of
lead
soldiers
real
thick
ones
with
proper
bodies
not
the
smooth
kind
they
are
no
good
a
fortress
a
proper
fortress
with
a
bridge
that
draws
up
and
trenches
that
hold
water
and
the
men
who
are
shot
fall
into
it
a
cannon
another
cannon
which
makes
two
cannons
and
two
cannons
for
the
enemy
too
because
without
you
could
have
a
battle
lots
of
little
cannons
an
army
must
have
artillery
and
the
side
that
has
the
best
artillery
beats
a
menagerie
if
has
got
a
menagerie
a
one
in
the
shape
of
an
owl
is
the
prettiest
would
have
been
a

says
any
fellow
who
gets
a
will
have
it
confiscated
a
pocket
kleist
has
one
you
press
a
nob
and
it
springs
open
it
a
jolly
thing
and
does
ink
your
trousers
ca
think
of
anything
more
except
sweets
lots
of
them
of
course
because
without
sweets
it
would
be
christmas
ah
but
i
would
like
best
of
all
to
come
home
dear
dear
mamma
why
may
i
but
if
i
really
must
i
try
and
be
good
but
it
makes
me
cry
when
i
think
about
it
the
boys
do
tease
me
now
and
i
have
to
thank
if
for
that
once
they
bullied
me
so
they
made
me
bleed
but
who
is
quite
small
too
went
for
the
big
boys
with
his
penknife
and
it
was
confiscated
but
they
were
awfully
frightened
please
send
lots
and
lots
of
lead
soldiers
i
want
to
give

postscript
i
shall
be
awfully
pleased
when
my
parcel
comes
this
epistle
arrived
at
münsterberg
addressed
to
minna
huth
on
the
sunday
before
christmas
felicitas
read
it
over
and
over
again
and
each
time
it
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
but
she
refrained
from
despatching
it
to
ulrich
for
as
likely
as
not
he
would
have
started
off
at
once
to
fetch
the
child
home
from
wiesbaden
to
make
up
for
sinning
against
the
boy
she
collected
an
unreasonable
number
of
expensive
presents
from
the
best
which
were
destined
to
ornament
paul
christmas
table
two
great
packets
had
come
from
berlin
from
which
she
was
making
a
selection
for
in
her
motherly
pride
she
wished
to
send
the
presents
direct
to
her
son
and
not
to
let
them
pass
through
other
hands
her
was
strewn
with
cardboard
boxes
and
brown
paper
and
was
full
of
the
fragrance
of
marzipan
and
which
she
had
baked
herself
felicitas
was
busy
packing
the
boxes
which
to
make
sure
of
their
arriving
in
time
from
münsterberg
were
to
be
sent
off
by
the
night
train
her
sleeves
were
turned
up
above
her
rosy
elbows
and
she
had
put
on
a
large
blue
cotton
apron
she
was
radiant
with
excitement
and
delighting
in
her
task
she
knelt
on
the
carpet
amongst
the
boxes
arranged
the
soldiers
in
order
of
battle
gave
a
punchinello
a
kiss
on
the
beard
for
the
dear
child
who
was
to
possess
him
and
watched
with
laughing
amusement
a
balloon
rise
in
the
air
with
a
tiny
trapeze
attached
to
it
on
which
a
toy
acrobat
performed
his
antics
apparently
she
was
absorbed
in
what
she
was
doing
but
from
time
to
time
minna
who
was
helping
her
observed
that
she
would
let
her
active
hands
fall
suddenly
in
her
lap
and
turn
her
eyes
to
the
window
with
wistful
longing
you
are
expecting
some
one
gracious
little
madame
she
inquired
at
length
the
wizened
yellow
face
bristled
with
curiosity
felicitas
sighed
and
shook
her
head
three
days
had
gone
by
since
that
night
on
the
ferry
and
leo
had
not
yet
put
in
an
appearance
that
is
the
way
of
gentlemen
the
old
philosophised
they
promise
to
come
and
do
felicitas
had
told
her
nothing
of
her
meeting
with
leo
but
since
the
old
woman
had
seen
her
return
that
night
with
suspiciously
sparkling
eyes
she
had
put
two
and
two
together
towards
four
the
house
bell
clanged
felicitas
made
a
bound
towards
the
door
now
stay
where
you
are
gracious
madame
said
the
old
hag
it
will
be
much
better
not
to
jump
down
his
throat
directly
he
does
come
and
she
hobbled
off
coughing
to
receive
the
visitor
but
felicitas
ran
into
the
and
laid
her
ear
on
the
as
she
recognised
the
man
voice
speaking
in
the
hall
she
put
her
hand
on
her
heart
and
threw
herself
into
an
armchair
with
a
deep
sigh
the
old
woman
came
back
leaving
the
door
half
open
behind
her
and
said
with
the
same
assumed
expression
of
vacancy
with
which
she
had
probably
received
leo
the
herr
von
sellenthin
is
there
but
i
have
said
that
madame
is
engaged
she
broke
off
for
there
he
stood
he
had
pushed
the
old
creature
aside
and
rushed
in
at
last
at
last
she
said
as
she
calmly
offered
him
her
hand
with
a
melancholy
smile
yes
at
last
he
repeated
with
a
hard
brusque
laugh
the
sound
of
which
from
him
was
strange
to
her
at
a
first
glance
she
saw
a
change
in
him
his
eyes
rolled
restlessly
and
his
forehead
was
deeply
marked
with
lines
of
anger
her
conscience
was
never
quite
serene
even
when
she
was
not
aware
of
having
erred
afresh
so
she
asked
stammering
have
i
done
anything
to
offend
you
again
so
soon
oh
no
certainly
not
he
retorted
and
leaned
back
for
a
moment
against
the
wall
screwing
up
his
eyes
then
he
asked
when
ulrich
was
coming
and
watched
greedily
for
her
answer
not
before
christmas
eve
and
it
may
be
even
later
for
here
we
distribute
our
presents
till
the
christmas
day
he
drew
a
deep
breath
what
ails
you
now
she
asked
feigning
uneasiness
he
laughed
that
hard
short
laugh
once
more
what
can
ail
me
dear
heart
a
with
the
most
charming
of
cousins
her
husband
safely
out
of
the
way
all
scruples
of
conscience
overcome
god
almighty
himself
an
accomplice
could
i
wish
for
anything
better
leo
do
you
frighten
me
she
said
and
crouched
back
in
her
armchair
why
should
you
be
frightened
my
dear
child
he
answered
taking
her
hand
i
have
become
a
little
wilder
these
last
few
days
that
is
all
that
is
i
have
been
trying
not
to
come
like
the
honourable
man
i
was
once
there
that
promise
at
the
ferry
dear
heart
i
always
called
you
dear
heart
in
old
days
so
now
we
are
so
intimate
i
may
again
eh
that
promise
was
rubbish
you
wormed
it
out
of
me
because
you
are
such
a
sly
card
and
leo
please
you
hurt
me
she
protested
covering
two
tearful
eyes
with
her
hand
he
caught
her
roughly
by
the
arm
and
wrenched
her
hand
from
her
face
you
sha
cry
he
growled
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
cry
although
i
know
your
crying
like
your
laughter
is
a
farce
i
ca
stand
your
tears
why
not
laugh
instead
it
all
amounts
to
the
same
thing
oh
if
you
should
be
heard
talking
like
this
what
would
it
matter
but
nevertheless
his
eye
wandered
in
some
anxiety
to
the
doors
i
ca
take
you
into
the
boudoir
she
said
thinking
of
the
litter
of
parcels
for
a
moment
a
picture
rose
before
her
of
the
child
all
expectation
and
excitement
about
his
christmas
presents
but
it
quickly
faded
giving
place
to
the
more
vital
interest
of
the
moment
he
stretched
his
hands
out
towards
the
door
in
fear
and
abhorrence
you
never
get
me
in
there
again
alive
he
cried
your
cursed
scent
gets
into
my
brain
and
drives
me
half
mad
and
it
would
be
ten
times
worse
but
i
tell
you
what
his
eye
sought
the
window
where
the
afternoon
sun
had
made
small
clearings
in
the
frost
pattern
on
the
panes
out
there
in
the
snow
it
is
clear
and
bracing
and
so
quiet
and
lonely
that
one
could
talk
in
peace
shout
defiance
at
the
world
too
if
one
has
the
mind
put
on
a
wrap
and
come
she
acquiesced
joyously
and
quickly
wound
a
lace
scarf
round
her
head
threw
over
her
diaphanous
house
dress
a
heavy
and
hurried
before
him
out
at
the
door
unseen
by
any
one
in
the
house
she
could
not
refrain
from
congratulating
herself
on
this
point
aloud
and
he
did
so
silently
their
flushed
faces
met
the
tingling
cold
of
the
winter
evening
the
sun
was
going
down
a
brilliant
crescent
moon
hung
in
the
steel
blue
eastern
sky
above
the
stables
the
copulas
of
which
cut
sharply
into
the
air
the
drone
of
the
was
heard
coming
from
the
barn
otherwise
the
yard
was
still
and
deserted
they
took
the
path
skirting
the
gable
wing
of
the
castle
opened
the
postern
gate
the
latch
of
which
was
frozen
and
entered
the
garden
it
lay
shimmering
before
them
in
its
garment
of
snow
with
an
opal
haze
hanging
over
it
the
urns
at
the
corners
of
the
terrace
were
capped
with
white
and
the
vines
on
the
wall
cowered
under
their
straw
covers
like
freezing
children
as
they
crossed
the
lawn
felicitas
tried
to
take
leo
arm
but
her
heavy
furs
impeded
her
movements
and
she
fell
behind
the
path
became
lost
in
the
snow
on
the
outskirts
of
the
plantation
but
still
they
were
not
disposed
to
turn
back
they
walked
on
silently
in
single
file
she
trying
to
step
in
his
footprints
once
he
glanced
round
and
asked
where
they
were
going
i
do
know
she
said
only
let
us
go
on
aimlessly
they
wandered
round
the
plantation
they
both
had
a
feeling
as
if
they
would
like
to
creep
away
beyond
the
ken
of
human
eyes
then
he
heard
her
teeth
chattering
you
are
cold
he
said
we
will
go
back
no
i
am
not
cold
she
declared
shivering
in
every
limb
i
have
only
got
on
rather
thin
shoes
and
she
pointed
with
a
faint
smile
to
her
slippers
which
in
her
impatience
to
come
out
she
had
forgotten
to
change
turn
back
at
once
he
commanded
she
pouted
a
little
and
he
to
put
an
end
to
her
resistance
added
or
i
shall
carry
you
she
spread
out
her
arms
beseechingly
and
said
smiling
then
carry
me
but
his
courage
failed
him
and
he
took
back
his
offer
you
had
better
walk
he
said
we
might
be
seen
from
the
windows
and
then
there
would
be
gossip
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
turned
round
it
was
nearly
dark
now
a
bar
of
sunset
pink
glowed
between
the
bare
boughs
and
there
was
a
rosy
gleam
on
the
wastes
of
snow
ere
they
became
bathed
in
night
nothing
stirred
only
now
and
then
little
heaps
of
snow
fell
from
the
twigs
and
plumped
on
the
ground
as
they
came
by
the
greenhouse
felicitas
pointed
to
the
reflection
of
a
fire
dancing
on
the
panes
of
the
glass
we
could
warm
ourselves
in
there
she
whispered
had
we
better
go
on
to
the
castle
he
asked
hesitatingly
as
he
cast
a
dark
sidelong
look
at
the
fire
no
come
along
she
exclaimed
with
a
light
laugh
and
led
the
way
into
the
he
followed
passively
faggots
of
wood
were
stacked
in
the
little
room
and
the
firelight
played
on
them
mysteriously
they
looked
like
wreckage
gradually
being
devoured
by
a
hidden
conflagration
the
door
of
the
furnace
was
below
the
level
of
the
floor
it
was
let
into
a
recess
in
the
wall
to
which
three
steps
led
down
flames
escaped
from
the
plaques
and
the
pungent
odour
of
damp
burning
felicitas
jumped
the
steps
into
the
recess
and
was
going
to
hold
her
frozen
feet
to
the
furnace
when
she
recollected
herself
and
coming
back
to
the
which
led
into
the
greenhouse
itself
she
called
the
gardener
name
through
the
darkness
there
was
no
response
only
the
sound
of
water
dropping
from
leaf
to
leaf
in
the
hot
moist
atmosphere
now
we
are
quite
safe
she
laughed
and
skipped
down
the
steps
again
sighing
with
contentment
at
the
warm
glow
the
cloak
slipped
from
her
shoulders
and
as
she
reclined
against
the
steps
her
figure
in
the
blue
morning
gown
was
revealed
in
soft
lines
against
the
white
fur
the
firelight
flickered
on
her
fair
hair
and
cast
a
shimmer
like
a
purple
veil
over
the
rounded
face
which
wore
the
childlike
pathetic
expression
habitual
to
it
when
in
repose
and
when
she
was
feeling
particularly
comfortable
why
do
you
stand
there
looking
like
an
old
owl
she
said
with
a
laugh
throwing
her
head
back
in
order
to
see
him
better
leo
who
was
leaning
against
a
pile
of
faggots
lost
in
thought
replied
it
a
pity
that
that
fur
does
grow
on
your
body
then
you
would
be
the
image
of
elly
white
persian
cat
do
you
think
that
you
have
said
enough
disagreeable
things
to
me
my
friend
i
show
you
affection
and
nothing
but
affection
but
you
insist
on
behaving
like
a
surly
dog
cat
and
dog
in
fact
leave
off
making
stupid
jokes
and
come
and
sit
down
he
did
as
he
was
bidden
and
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
furnace
so
that
he
could
look
down
on
her
outstretched
form
are
we
like
hansel
and
grethel
she
asked
struck
by
the
poetry
of
their
situation
now
tell
me
a
pretty
story
of
knights
and
princesses
and
we
shall
be
fifteen
years
old
you
can
feel
so
innocent
yes
she
answered
and
so
in
love
not
with
you
you
vain
person
but
with
that
chivalrous
knight
whom
you
are
to
have
the
honour
of
presenting
me
to
in
old
days
it
was
the
same
and
do
you
remember
how
furious
it
made
johanna
how
furious
the
grim
picture
of
his
sister
rose
before
him
he
sank
into
a
gloomy
reverie
while
she
continued
chattering
to
speak
honestly
i
was
gone
on
you
then
you
were
such
a
thorough
boy
but
what
shall
i
say
rather
green
it
seemed
as
if
you
would
or
could
see
every
evening
i
threw
beautiful
kisses
out
of
the
window
down
to
your
room
but
you
never
noticed
them
yet
all
the
same
you
were
madly
in
love
and
that
annoyed
johanna
terribly
and
no
wonder
as
ulrich
was
another
bad
case
ulrich
name
that
she
thus
let
slip
playfully
over
her
lips
made
her
pause
she
gave
leo
an
anxious
glance
and
then
gazed
thoughtfully
into
the
flames
ah
she
sighed
after
a
while
who
would
have
thought
things
would
turn
out
as
they
did
and
are
going
to
turn
out
he
muttered
shaken
by
impotent
rage
what
do
you
mean
she
said
naïvely
woman
have
you
no
suspicion
of
the
abyss
towards
which
we
are
drifting
he
exclaimed
holding
out
his
clenched
fingers
please
do
tease
me
she
begged
and
turning
away
from
him
she
half
hid
her
face
in
the
furs
speak
out
i
will
at
least
know
whether
you
have
any
idea
of
the
dangerous
game
you
are
playing
with
yourself
and
me
ah
leo
she
murmured
i
do
want
to
think
i
wo
think
it
is
so
sweet
to
be
together
that
is
all
i
know
and
all
i
care
about
at
first
we
were
to
repent
he
scolded
further
and
to
do
nothing
else
we
were
to
go
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
and
scourge
our
bodies
and
souls
and
god
knows
i
have
carried
out
my
part
of
the
programme
my
remorse
has
so
lacerated
and
bruised
me
that
i
feel
as
if
there
an
honest
fibre
left
in
me
i
seem
to
myself
so
corrupt
and
rotten
that
when
any
one
offers
me
his
hand
i
almost
cry
out
defile
yourself
by
touching
me
if
that
was
the
object
of
it
all
then
it
has
been
attained
but
is
what
we
are
doing
now
remorse
tell
me
that
woman
is
it
rather
fresh
infamy
i
do
know
she
repeated
sighing
i
only
know
that
it
is
sweet
and
you
are
satisfied
she
nodded
three
times
in
blissful
silence
then
she
said
you
are
here
and
that
is
enough
but
you
do
ask
what
i
have
had
to
endure
before
i
came
can
you
conceive
what
it
is
for
a
man
to
cling
wildly
to
the
last
straw
of
that
he
has
left
i
have
spent
whole
nights
tramping
the
woods
i
have
run
till
the
soles
of
my
feet
bled
i
have
tried
to
tire
myself
to
death
so
as
not
to
come
here
but
i
have
come
like
a
hungry
helpless
child
he
put
out
his
hands
to
her
in
beseeching
appeal
and
she
drank
in
his
words
with
burning
eyes
my
poor
poor
boy
she
said
in
a
low
tone
and
reaching
up
to
him
she
caressed
his
feet
and
then
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
wept
bitterly
she
stared
at
him
in
terror
and
alarm
in
all
the
sixteen
years
that
she
had
known
him
she
had
never
seen
a
tear
in
his
eyes
before
she
jumped
up
and
taking
his
head
between
both
her
hands
whispered
leo
dear
dearest
leo
she
tried
to
loosen
his
fingers
and
as
she
could
not
succeed
pressed
her
lips
to
them
he
did
not
stir
her
anxiety
grew
ever
greater
and
she
sprang
upon
the
steps
to
kneel
beside
him
so
that
she
could
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
a
dim
inkling
of
her
guiltiness
towards
him
dawned
on
her
as
she
saw
this
giant
so
crushed
in
body
and
soul
to
make
good
the
harm
that
she
had
done
and
to
drown
her
own
compassion
she
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
kiss
him
and
she
kissed
every
bit
of
his
face
which
she
could
reach
she
kissed
his
hair
his
hands
his
throat
then
she
drew
his
head
down
on
her
lap
and
unlocked
his
hands
with
caressing
fingers
he
lay
like
a
man
asleep
with
closed
eyes
and
relaxed
muscles
his
breath
came
in
short
heavy
gasps
and
she
kissed
him
long
and
passionately
on
the
lips
he
opened
his
eyes
shivering
and
gave
her
a
look
then
closed
them
again
we
must
go
now
she
whispered
gently
raising
his
head
the
gardener
might
come
and
surprise
us
and
then
it
would
be
all
up
indeed
he
rubbed
his
forehead
rose
slowly
and
shook
himself
and
then
reeled
against
the
wall
come
come
she
implored
drawing
her
furs
over
her
shoulders
yes
i
am
coming
he
said
and
stumbled
obediently
behind
her
out
into
the
snow
he
paused
at
the
hall
door
you
are
not
going
home
she
asked
shocked
at
the
idea
yes
i
shall
go
home
he
responded
there
was
something
monotonous
almost
mechanical
in
his
way
of
speaking
which
prevented
her
pressing
him
to
come
in
ah
how
sweet
it
was
she
murmured
seizing
his
hand
and
pressing
it
to
her
heart
he
made
no
reply
but
turned
from
her
and
walked
away
into
the
darkness
with
uncertain
steps
she
heard
his
voice
once
more
coming
from
the
stables
then
the
tinkle
of
a
and
all
was
silent
as
old
minna
opened
the
door
to
her
mistress
she
beheld
a
pair
of
eyes
radiant
with
delight
and
parted
lips
smiling
blissfully
now
god
be
praised
said
she
all
is
right
again
felicitas
glided
past
her
in
silence
and
locked
herself
in
her
bedroom
it
was
too
late
to
think
any
more
of
paul
christmas
parcel
that
night
xxxi
christmas
eve
was
drawing
very
near
but
hertha
prachwitz
was
still
not
quite
ready
with
her
presents
for
her
stepmother
she
had
painted
a
hymnbook
cover
of
punched
leather
with
mottoes
and
emblems
she
had
embroidered
a
for
grandmamma
and
crocheted
an
irish
lace
collar
for
elly
now
she
was
at
work
till
late
at
night
on
a
which
was
to
be
sent
anonymously
to
leo
and
which
besides
places
for
letters
contained
a
memorandum
table
and
a
frame
for
photographs
this
frame
was
designed
specially
to
hold
a
picture
of
felicitas
von
kletzingk
hertha
had
not
come
any
nearer
solving
the
problem
as
to
whether
she
was
wicked
or
not
but
one
thing
she
knew
for
certain
that
he
loved
her
and
so
she
hoped
his
love
might
not
be
in
vain
she
herself
had
quietly
renounced
all
thought
of
him
perhaps
she
would
become
a
catholic
again
and
go
into
a
convent
or
perhaps
as
succumb
to
the
first
epidemic
there
were
indeed
numbers
of
opportunities
of
seeking
the
death
of
the
superfluous
her
intention
of
becoming
a
hertha
had
not
been
able
to
keep
to
herself
her
stepmother
unfortunately
encouraged
the
idea
at
this
time
she
wore
black
dresses
with
white
collars
and
cuffs
after
the
style
of
english
nurses
and
in
secret
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
herself
and
elly
this
phase
in
hertha
caused
grandmamma
much
uneasiness
and
as
she
found
that
she
could
no
longer
win
the
child
confidence
she
consulted
pastor
brenckenberg
about
her
one
sunday
in
the
vestry
the
old
man
gave
wise
advice
he
stroked
his
fat
double
chin
and
said
grinning
do
fret
frau
von
sellenthin
it
is
really
nothing
serious
between
the
ages
of
fifteen
and
eighteen
sometimes
sooner
sometimes
later
most
young
girls
get
a
strong
religious
craze
it
will
pass
off
like
measles
crossing
herself
too
a
habit
she
must
have
acquired
when
a
catholic
she
will
grow
out
of
mark
my
words
and
have
patience
the
old
lady
smiled
and
was
satisfied
but
hertha
strenuous
mood
continued
she
had
blue
rings
round
her
eyes
and
gazed
at
the
moon
one
might
have
thought
she
was
ill
had
not
her
figure
in
these
weeks
began
to
develop
into
beauty
the
flatness
of
her
breast
yielded
to
rounded
curves
her
brown
throat
became
fuller
her
shoulders
lost
their
angularity
and
took
on
graceful
sloping
lines
her
face
alone
remained
small
and
sharp
and
kept
its
restless
expression
all
the
rebellious
discontent
and
pain
caused
by
the
betrayal
of
her
love
which
inwardly
devoured
her
could
not
resist
the
influence
of
the
approaching
festival
of
peace
and
goodwill
while
she
was
industriously
working
at
her
presents
love
gushed
forth
from
every
pore
of
her
being
an
impulse
towards
goodness
and
forgiveness
mastered
her
and
even
stifled
that
burning
indescribable
bitterness
which
as
a
rule
took
possession
of
her
whenever
the
beautiful
woman
image
rose
before
her
eyes
the
day
before
christmas
eve
the
painting
of
the
pocketbook
was
finished
if
not
altogether
to
her
satisfaction
and
the
photograph
of
frau
von
kletzingk
which
she
had
abstracted
from
the
family
album
graced
the
frame
now
the
only
difficulty
remaining
was
how
to
get
her
present
to
the
nearest
in
dead
secrecy
fortunately
an
opportunity
occurred
just
in
the
nick
of
time
grandmamma
who
was
preparing
the
servants
christmas
tables
found
her
supply
of
nuts
and
gingerbreads
had
run
short
and
that
she
had
also
miscalculated
the
number
of
aprons
and
woollen
mittens
required
one
ca
turn
a
dog
out
in
weather
like
this
she
said
but
if
only
i
knew
of
some
one
who
was
going
to
hoffmann
in
münsterberg
i
would
ask
him
to
act
the
part
of
a
real
santa
claus
hertha
with
a
beating
heart
offered
to
undertake
the
journey
my
lamb
is
always
to
the
fore
when
there
is
any
kindness
to
be
done
said
grandmamma
in
the
closed
sleigh
perhaps
you
wo
find
it
too
cold
half
an
hour
later
she
was
on
the
way
a
whirled
through
the
air
so
thick
that
it
seemed
as
if
white
towels
were
flapping
over
the
sleigh
windows
the
fine
frozen
flakes
as
hard
as
bullets
pelted
against
the
glass
as
if
huge
shovelfuls
of
white
sand
were
being
hurled
against
it
the
voice
of
the
storm
whistled
uncannily
through
the
chinks
yet
it
was
cosy
and
warm
underneath
the
fur
rugs
and
the
twilight
of
the
confined
space
was
conducive
to
dreaming
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
a
web
as
soft
as
velvet
was
being
spun
closer
and
closer
around
her
shutting
her
off
from
all
the
vexations
of
life
she
released
her
cramped
hold
on
the
precious
and
burying
her
head
in
the
farthest
corner
thought
only
good
and
noble
things
about
him
the
sleigh
flew
through
the
air
like
a
bird
only
as
it
inclined
towards
the
stream
did
it
begin
to
bump
a
little
she
looked
up
in
some
alarm
at
the
miniature
icebergs
with
clouds
of
snow
dancing
above
them
on
either
side
of
the
track
which
had
now
been
made
across
the
solid
ice
when
she
arrived
in
münsterberg
and
the
chance
of
sending
off
the
was
deliciously
within
reach
she
became
undecisive
again
all
she
had
to
do
was
to
say
to
the
young
man
at
hoffmann
pack
this
for
me
and
address
it
to
herr
von
sellenthin
and
the
thing
would
be
done
as
she
was
reflecting
this
she
beheld
with
a
start
sleigh
a
few
yards
in
front
of
her
she
recognised
him
instantly
without
his
turning
round
he
wore
a
and
high
oilskin
boots
the
winter
cap
which
grandmamma
had
knitted
him
out
of
grey
fleecy
wool
was
drawn
over
his
ears
a
hill
of
driven
snow
rested
between
his
shoulders
hertha
was
not
in
the
least
prepared
to
meet
him
in
münsterberg
it
was
true
she
had
not
seen
him
at
home
before
she
came
out
but
that
was
nothing
extraordinary
because
he
was
hardly
ever
to
be
seen
there
except
at
dinner
when
he
still
joined
the
family
party
to
eat
in
silence
what
was
handed
him
and
then
to
hurry
away
now
he
spotted
his
own
horses
hulloa
who
that
he
cried
to
the
coachman
who
stopped
while
he
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
oh
you
child
is
it
he
said
smiling
wearily
and
sadly
but
filling
her
with
delight
his
beard
was
encrusted
with
snow
and
thawing
drops
ran
over
his
forehead
and
cheeks
have
you
still
got
purchases
to
make
for
this
evening
yes
ah
that
all
right
i
would
drive
with
you
only
i
got
my
own
turn
out
i
have
business
at
the
prussian
crown
take
care
of
yourself
child
and
do
get
cold
he
gave
her
his
hand
and
shut
the
sleigh
door
the
horses
moved
on
and
he
vanished
hertha
leaned
back
in
her
corner
and
shut
her
eyes
tight
she
was
quite
decided
now
not
to
send
the
he
had
only
to
smile
and
all
her
sulks
were
gone
ah
she
must
think
of
something
very
nice
to
do
for
him
now
something
extra
nice
she
accomplished
her
shopping
at
hoffmann
which
was
in
a
tumultuous
bustle
she
bought
aprons
with
flowery
patterns
and
all
the
woollen
mittens
had
coloured
borders
and
she
defrayed
the
extra
cost
out
of
her
own
purse
while
she
was
seeing
her
parcels
packed
into
the
sleigh
at
the
door
of
the
prussian
crown
she
became
aware
that
leo
was
sitting
at
a
little
table
in
the
window
of
the
there
was
a
bottle
of
wine
before
him
and
his
head
was
buried
dejectedly
in
his
hands
her
heart
beat
faster
she
would
have
liked
to
ask
if
there
was
anything
she
could
do
for
him
on
the
way
home
but
she
had
the
courage
to
approach
him
the
drive
back
was
again
like
a
dream
she
could
not
forget
how
he
had
smiled
and
how
kindly
and
simply
he
had
greeted
her
it
is
christmas
she
thought
that
drives
all
enmity
out
of
people
hearts
and
now
she
knew
what
she
would
do
to
please
him
the
should
lie
on
his
plate
as
a
token
of
reconciliation
and
instead
of
likeness
grandmamma
dear
honest
face
should
smile
out
at
him
from
the
frame
that
would
alter
the
character
of
the
present
altogether
hertha
arrived
home
at
two
she
was
tired
but
happy
and
still
held
the
in
her
fingers
there
was
not
much
for
her
to
do
grandmamma
and
the
old
mamselle
were
arranging
the
presents
and
the
salon
doors
were
locked
elly
who
had
been
fearfully
lazy
and
had
scarcely
finished
in
time
her
two
yards
of
tatting
for
grandmamma
was
stretched
out
on
the
sofa
and
began
forthwith
to
talk
nonsense
if
bruno
only
knew
what
frank
had
whispered
in
her
ear
it
must
come
to
a
duel
between
them
and
if
frank
knew
what
bruno
had
said
to
kattie
about
her
a
duel
would
also
be
the
inevitable
consequence
first
she
said
she
would
cry
herself
sick
over
bruno
death
and
five
minutes
later
over
frank
so
her
chatter
went
on
aimlessly
interlarded
with
all
sorts
of
expressions
which
filled
hertha
with
contemptuous
disgust
during
the
autumn
elly
had
acquired
a
whole
dictionary
of
english
slang
and
talked
of
hot
flirtations
jolly
fellows
and
of
things
being
smart
and
swagger
till
hertha
was
almost
mad
from
irritation
the
latter
stood
at
the
window
from
which
one
could
see
into
the
courtyard
she
watched
the
drifting
snow
flying
clouds
of
which
waltzed
above
the
stables
and
whipped
from
the
slates
of
the
roof
the
white
masses
clung
to
the
fanes
like
linen
flags
the
wind
howled
and
sighed
in
the
trees
and
on
the
side
that
faced
the
wind
their
trunks
were
encrusted
with
great
icicles
here
and
there
on
the
lawn
patches
of
the
turf
were
visible
and
within
them
the
withered
trembling
blades
of
grass
looked
like
corpses
brought
out
of
their
grave
by
magic
and
made
to
dance
a
weird
measure
a
pale
light
escaping
from
the
clouds
illumined
the
dusk
uncannily
the
smallest
strip
of
sulphurous
yellow
showed
the
place
where
the
sun
had
gone
down
hertha
in
her
happy
childish
years
had
believed
that
the
christchild
came
down
to
earth
on
a
sunbeam
but
there
was
none
to
be
seen
now
ah
how
long
ago
it
seemed
since
those
days
she
felt
old
and
weary
of
life
eternities
of
gnawing
pain
and
suffering
seemed
to
lie
behind
her
yet
before
her
she
looked
out
expectantly
for
a
sweet
vague
dreadful
something
the
prospect
of
which
filled
her
young
soul
with
blissful
melancholy
and
brought
tears
of
holy
thankfulness
into
her
eyes
it
was
like
a
low
and
mysterious
whispering
an
elegy
and
a
song
of
spring
in
one
she
thought
of
things
that
promise
to
blossom
into
vigorous
life
a
covered
with
dewy
buds
a
bird
nest
filled
with
yellow
speckled
eggs
such
as
these
were
the
sacred
hopes
and
secrets
that
lie
buried
and
cherished
in
the
depths
of
the
soul
and
christmas
after
all
was
said
and
done
meant
love
and
peace
goodwill
and
forgiveness
the
clock
struck
five
greyer
became
the
masses
of
snow
outside
and
more
and
more
did
the
roof
of
the
stables
become
one
with
the
sky
and
still
he
did
come
already
the
hum
of
many
voices
proceeded
from
the
servants
hall
impatience
had
brought
the
guests
to
the
house
long
before
the
bell
was
to
sound
but
grandmamma
had
been
prepared
for
this
emergency
and
had
ordered
an
enormous
supply
of
hot
coffee
and
buns
to
be
in
readiness
hertha
wanted
to
make
herself
useful
and
went
down
to
them
there
they
stood
in
long
files
exhaling
the
odour
of
fustian
and
warming
their
benumbed
fingers
on
their
johanna
ragged
school
was
represented
in
full
force
at
first
she
had
intended
to
entertain
her
pupils
under
her
own
roof
not
wishing
to
crave
hospitality
for
them
from
her
sullen
brother
but
at
hertha
earnest
request
and
grandmamma
assurances
that
leo
would
not
object
she
had
determined
to
bring
her
little
people
over
to
the
castle
for
the
festive
evening
old
and
young
greeted
beaming
the
universally
popular
gracious
little
countess
she
took
her
favourites
in
turn
on
her
lap
listened
to
detailed
complaints
of
winter
hardships
from
the
mothers
and
regarded
herself
altogether
as
a
good
angel
but
time
went
on
and
he
did
come
when
it
struck
six
the
company
began
to
stream
out
into
the
corridors
and
press
towards
the
door
of
the
salon
there
they
grew
eager
and
noisy
though
each
knew
perfectly
well
that
his
plate
would
be
standing
ready
for
him
in
its
proper
place
they
fought
with
knees
and
elbows
to
get
in
front
of
each
other
hertha
went
back
to
the
because
she
was
no
longer
needed
by
any
one
grandmamma
was
pacing
up
and
down
excitedly
johanna
was
staring
at
the
lamp
and
elly
yawned
and
fidgeted
with
the
fringe
of
the
such
want
of
consideration
lamented
grandmamma
he
must
know
that
the
people
will
go
nearly
mad
at
being
kept
waiting
he
must
know
how
they
will
want
to
see
him
and
yet
he
ca
come
home
for
once
even
on
christmas
eve
but
must
needs
go
knocking
about
goodness
knows
where
hertha
was
horrified
at
grandmamma
who
always
took
his
part
being
so
irate
with
him
and
that
he
should
have
at
least
one
person
to
defend
him
she
said
i
met
him
in
münsterberg
this
morning
he
had
some
business
to
do
at
the
prussian
crown
but
grandmamma
growing
still
more
wroth
exclaimed
business
indeed
who
transacts
business
on
christmas
eve
hertha
pictured
him
hurrying
through
the
snowy
stormy
night
towards
the
domestic
hearth
and
saw
him
stuck
fast
in
a
snowdrift
her
heart
was
nearly
bursting
with
anxiety
and
pity
how
her
sentiments
had
changed
since
early
this
morning
all
because
of
a
friendly
word
and
a
christmassy
smile
she
glided
with
the
under
her
apron
to
a
drawer
tossed
lizzie
photograph
contemptuously
into
a
corner
and
put
grandmamma
in
its
place
the
clock
struck
seven
they
were
getting
so
excited
now
outside
that
they
were
nearly
forcing
the
doors
open
and
still
there
was
no
sound
of
approaching
it
ca
be
helped
said
grandmamma
wiping
away
her
tears
we
must
celebrate
christmas
without
the
master
of
the
house
we
ought
to
be
used
to
it
remarked
johanna
in
her
bitter
way
hertha
almost
hated
her
for
saying
it
but
do
you
see
replied
poor
grandmamma
beginning
to
cry
again
how
doubly
painful
and
trying
it
is
for
me
four
christmases
he
has
been
away
in
america
and
god
knows
where
else
and
now
when
he
has
come
home
he
treats
me
like
this
just
wait
another
quarter
of
an
hour
implored
hertha
it
the
bad
weather
i
am
sure
that
is
keeping
him
away
and
they
waited
not
a
quarter
but
half
an
hour
and
then
the
mamselle
came
in
i
ca
manage
the
people
any
longer
she
announced
the
children
are
crying
and
the
men
say
they
go
home
come
said
grandmamma
resolutely
we
must
begin
without
him
the
three
who
had
decked
the
trees
went
to
light
them
up
leaving
the
cousins
alone
a
breathless
stillness
reigned
in
the
house
do
you
think
elly
asked
still
playing
with
the
fringe
of
the
that
i
shall
have
any
anonymous
presents
hertha
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
disdained
to
reply
and
then
the
bell
rang
hertha
felt
the
same
eager
anxiety
as
in
childhood
as
with
trembling
hands
she
gathered
her
presents
together
and
took
them
to
the
salon
the
folding
doors
were
flung
wide
and
she
was
met
by
a
flood
of
soft
light
from
hundreds
of
lighted
tapers
the
spacious
room
was
filled
with
the
brilliance
and
fragrance
of
three
giant
one
for
the
family
one
for
the
servants
and
tenants
and
a
third
for
the
ragged
school
on
long
tables
with
spotless
white
cloths
plate
after
plate
was
ranged
and
beside
them
were
parcels
of
warm
petticoats
shoes
caps
comforters
and
stockings
the
knitting
of
which
had
occupied
grandmamma
busy
hands
all
through
the
spring
and
hot
summer
days
for
the
children
besides
the
useful
garments
and
the
sweets
were
piles
of
cheap
tops
for
as
grandmamma
said
we
all
must
be
young
once
in
they
poured
by
the
opposite
door
with
happy
faces
and
those
of
them
who
had
threatened
to
storm
the
entrance
a
few
minutes
ago
were
the
very
ones
who
now
sidled
along
the
wall
too
shy
to
approach
the
tables
they
let
themselves
at
last
be
brought
forward
one
by
one
and
then
eyed
their
property
with
sidelong
glances
as
if
they
would
have
to
steal
it
before
it
could
be
really
their
own
hertha
had
so
much
to
do
in
encouraging
explaining
and
leading
people
to
their
plates
that
she
had
no
time
to
think
of
her
own
presents
meanwhile
the
inmates
of
the
steward
house
the
two
bailiffs
the
brewer
and
the
accountant
had
made
their
appearance
and
drawn
near
the
family
table
a
merry
christmas
my
dear
sirs
said
grandmamma
struggling
bravely
with
her
tears
my
son
is
late
when
he
comes
he
will
say
more
than
i
can
the
brewer
was
full
of
apologies
what
for
no
one
knew
and
schumann
seemed
ill
at
ease
hertha
drew
him
aside
honestly
herr
schumann
she
asked
him
do
you
think
it
possible
that
he
has
met
with
an
accident
he
may
have
answered
the
good
fellow
he
may
have
missed
his
way
in
the
storm
and
driven
into
a
ditch
or
something
of
the
kind
but
say
nought
about
it
little
countess
or
it
will
spoil
the
fun
then
wo
you
take
any
steps
she
inquired
choking
back
her
nervousness
yes
certainly
after
the
distribution
he
would
send
out
a
search
party
and
with
that
she
was
obliged
to
be
content
for
the
present
grandmamma
had
a
word
of
love
and
kindness
for
every
one
in
spite
of
her
private
distress
with
quiet
tenderness
she
stroked
hertha
cheek
and
led
her
to
her
table
hertha
saw
a
stack
of
books
and
the
flash
of
something
gold
but
her
eyes
were
too
blind
with
unshed
tears
to
see
more
johanna
with
chastened
smiles
did
the
honours
to
her
charges
she
drew
them
up
in
a
line
and
bade
them
sing
the
christmas
hymn
the
practising
of
which
for
the
last
two
months
had
resounded
daily
through
the
glades
of
the
park
all
the
little
ones
stood
still
and
silently
folded
their
hands
down
from
heaven
i
came
to
earth
roared
the
sharp
screeching
small
voices
through
the
salon
happiness
encouraging
them
to
a
mighty
effort
then
of
a
sudden
the
door
was
flung
open
and
violently
banged
back
in
its
lock
every
one
looked
round
and
the
laboriously
practised
chorale
began
to
waver
silence
there
cried
a
threatening
hoarse
voice
which
instantly
cut
short
the
singing
hertha
knees
were
quaking
she
saw
what
happened
while
scarcely
daring
to
look
with
eyes
and
face
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
melting
snow
he
came
across
the
floor
his
heels
ringing
sharply
upon
it
and
every
one
withdrew
into
corners
in
awe
and
terror
at
his
approach
what
mismanagement
is
this
he
thundered
how
comes
it
that
christmas
is
being
kept
in
my
house
and
i
not
present
i
have
had
to
climb
over
the
wall
like
a
burglar
to
get
in
at
all
out
with
you
you
hounds
get
to
your
sleighs
and
begone
heaven
help
us
he
is
drunk
murmured
grandmamma
and
wrung
her
hands
hertha
threw
her
arms
round
her
as
if
she
would
protect
the
old
lady
from
his
fury
johanna
now
asserted
herself
no
one
has
any
right
to
disturb
the
festival
of
christmas
she
said
measuring
him
with
a
scornful
eye
not
even
the
master
of
the
house
aye
the
devil
take
your
fine
speeches
he
shouted
staring
piercingly
in
her
face
with
eyes
full
of
hate
if
i
tolerate
your
over
there
all
the
more
strongly
do
i
forbid
it
in
my
own
house
now
i
wish
to
have
quiet
do
you
understand
only
too
well
she
replied
smiling
to
herself
significantly
then
she
gathered
up
her
train
and
moved
away
he
strode
up
to
his
mother
who
has
sunk
helplessly
into
an
armchair
and
whose
head
seemed
palsied
with
distress
leave
grandmamma
alone
hertha
cried
half
out
of
her
senses
from
horror
and
she
covered
the
dear
face
protectingly
with
her
hands
now
now
he
muttered
stupidly
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
half
absently
on
the
little
group
slowly
he
seemed
to
become
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
go
away
exclaimed
hertha
trembling
with
anger
you
are
behaving
like
a
wild
beast
he
growled
and
grumbled
to
himself
then
threw
himself
heavily
on
to
a
chair
on
the
back
of
which
a
for
hertha
had
been
artistically
arranged
the
room
had
gradually
emptied
some
had
stealthily
seized
their
plates
others
had
left
their
gifts
in
the
lurch
hoping
for
a
happier
opportunity
of
taking
possession
of
them
come
grandmamma
hertha
said
you
will
at
least
be
safe
in
your
own
room
he
started
up
and
then
relapsed
again
into
sullen
brooding
grandmamma
rose
with
hertha
help
my
son
my
son
she
sighed
softly
folding
her
hands
over
him
he
nodded
and
continued
growling
and
muttering
the
old
lady
left
the
room
on
hertha
arm
and
elly
who
had
been
hiding
behind
her
table
trotted
after
them
at
the
door
hertha
looked
round
there
he
still
sat
utterly
alone
in
the
vast
empty
salon
with
its
illuminated
and
the
long
white
tables
and
he
was
staring
after
them
with
an
expression
of
such
heartrending
and
inconsolable
wretchedness
that
hertha
at
the
sight
of
it
felt
a
cold
shiver
run
through
her
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
looking
into
an
abyss
of
human
misery
that
would
swallow
her
too
xxxii
on
the
afternoon
of
the
second
christmas
festival
the
two
friends
met
again
after
a
separation
of
nearly
six
weeks
ulrich
who
had
arrived
home
on
christmas
eve
waited
a
day
to
see
if
leo
would
turn
up
but
when
he
neither
came
nor
sent
word
he
started
off
to
call
on
him
he
found
him
in
his
study
still
arrayed
in
nightshirt
and
reclining
on
the
sofa
enveloped
in
clouds
of
smoke
what
a
sluggard
you
become
cried
ulrich
with
a
laugh
but
his
heart
sank
at
the
sight
of
the
waste
of
so
much
splendid
vigour
the
entrance
of
his
friend
gave
leo
a
slight
shock
of
alarm
but
he
suppressed
it
immediately
and
rising
hurried
to
greet
him
ulrich
was
aghast
at
the
red
bloated
appearance
of
leo
face
and
the
puffiness
of
his
eyes
what
is
the
matter
with
you
are
you
ill
he
inquired
leo
answered
laughing
it
simply
laziness
an
attack
of
laziness
that
all
and
he
gave
his
friend
hands
a
pressure
that
was
nerveless
and
limp
ulrich
said
nothing
but
continued
to
gaze
searchingly
at
features
in
solicitous
anxiety
sit
down
and
make
yourself
at
home
wo
you
have
a
hot
drink
coffee
tea
grog
negus
eh
damned
cold
out
of
doors
i
preferred
the
storm
have
you
had
a
comfortable
journey
it
a
long
way
from
berlin
here
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
hard
you
know
me
soon
i
beg
your
pardon
i
will
look
at
something
else
if
you
wish
it
devil
take
it
do
be
so
touchy
man
one
has
to
be
so
beastly
careful
in
talking
to
you
now
have
a
cognac
to
please
me
i
have
got
it
here
old
hennessy
it
would
pick
up
a
corpse
you
know
that
i
never
drink
spirits
or
liqueurs
very
unwise
in
the
highest
degree
unwise
dear
ulrich
one
ought
to
provide
for
one
bodily
needs
it
a
duty
we
all
owe
ourselves
excuse
me
if
i
attend
to
mine
he
fetched
a
flask
of
cognac
from
the
cupboard
of
his
and
tossed
off
hastily
three
or
four
glasses
which
seemed
to
have
a
soothing
effect
upon
him
you
think
he
said
laughingly
that
i
am
becoming
a
secret
bibber
but
i
ask
you
what
else
is
a
lonely
beggar
to
do
when
his
heart
it
is
your
own
fault
that
you
are
lonely
interrupted
ulrich
how
my
fault
you
hold
yourself
aloof
from
all
your
neighbours
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
even
the
way
to
uhlenfelde
ho
ho
it
used
to
be
the
custom
for
you
to
come
over
to
uhlenfelde
on
christmas
day
you
might
have
come
here
as
easily
ulrich
looked
at
him
in
stupefaction
for
the
first
time
it
struck
him
that
like
more
ordinary
friendships
theirs
might
be
subject
to
friction
so
in
a
gentler
and
almost
caressing
tone
he
went
on
as
you
did
come
to
me
i
was
compelled
to
come
to
you
but
i
regarded
it
as
my
duty
not
to
leave
felicitas
yesterday
after
being
away
so
long
putting
yesterday
out
of
the
question
felicitas
tells
me
that
you
have
been
only
once
to
uhlenfelde
during
my
absence
and
that
quite
recently
the
hypocritical
creature
he
said
to
himself
and
he
felt
a
kind
of
melancholy
admiration
for
her
powers
of
dissimulation
your
wife
is
not
you
he
said
with
a
feeble
attempt
at
emulating
her
but
she
is
part
of
me
responded
ulrich
and
it
would
have
given
me
pleasure
now
that
things
are
straight
between
you
if
oh
yes
perfectly
so
he
scoffed
inwardly
and
a
short
bitter
laugh
which
he
could
not
check
in
time
made
ulrich
halt
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
to
give
his
friend
another
amazed
scrutiny
for
god
sake
stop
staring
at
me
like
that
he
cried
interpreting
every
glance
of
ulrich
as
a
want
of
confidence
you
must
put
up
with
me
as
i
am
whether
i
please
you
or
not
and
let
me
repeat
what
i
have
often
said
before
old
boy
you
with
your
narrow
chest
and
anæmic
temperament
can
have
no
conception
of
the
evil
passions
which
rampage
about
in
this
powerful
roomy
carcase
he
struck
his
bare
breast
with
his
clenched
hand
and
thought
to
himself
what
a
brute
i
am
ulrich
made
no
response
but
looked
at
him
blankly
more
and
more
unable
to
comprehend
him
leo
was
conscious
how
step
by
step
he
was
losing
ground
with
his
friend
he
saw
as
clearly
what
was
passing
within
him
as
if
his
heart
lay
exposed
under
the
to
himself
he
appeared
in
the
light
of
a
clumsy
actor
disgusted
with
his
yet
making
renewed
efforts
to
play
it
out
to
the
bitter
end
so
he
went
on
think
what
a
life
this
is
for
a
fellow
like
me
in
america
i
was
in
the
saddle
sometimes
for
eight
days
together
and
only
happy
when
i
was
going
for
man
or
beast
but
here
i
am
at
a
loss
and
what
interest
can
i
have
in
this
hole
how
amuse
myself
it
will
end
either
in
going
to
pieces
or
putting
a
bullet
through
my
brain
look
at
me
as
i
lie
here
now
i
have
lain
since
yesterday
morning
they
bring
my
meals
to
my
room
and
at
night
i
creep
into
bed
i
shall
be
glad
when
these
cursed
holidays
are
over
for
then
i
shall
at
least
be
able
to
work
again
if
you
can
call
it
work
the
futile
rushing
about
on
the
estate
with
scowling
face
and
air
of
undue
importance
when
in
reality
all
there
is
to
be
done
is
done
by
god
almighty
but
one
must
needs
interfere
must
be
doing
something
to
deaden
reflection
to
hunt
the
wretched
thoughts
that
torment
one
out
of
one
head
yet
every
day
they
recur
whether
one
runs
away
from
them
or
lies
in
wait
for
them
like
a
panther
in
a
cage
and
the
burden
of
them
is
intolerable
what
are
these
thoughts
to
which
you
are
always
alluding
for
sake
explain
cried
ulrich
scarcely
able
to
master
his
anxiety
leo
gave
a
discordant
laugh
it
would
not
interest
you
he
said
and
he
gave
ulrich
face
a
piercing
sidelong
glance
ulrich
sprang
to
his
feet
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
his
breathing
came
in
gasps
and
his
haggard
cheeks
were
flushed
then
he
stood
still
in
front
of
leo
and
said
with
resolve
burning
in
his
brilliant
eyes
look
here
i
speak
seriously
to
you
old
boy
i
too
have
my
burden
to
bear
i
have
never
felt
more
keenly
the
desolation
of
my
home
than
this
christmas
when
the
little
chap
who
should
have
been
dancing
round
the
has
not
been
there
he
ought
to
have
come
home
but
my
wife
did
wish
it
there
something
strained
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
now
a
feeling
somehow
as
if
misfortune
were
pending
i
feel
a
stranger
at
my
own
fireside
leo
cowered
under
the
touch
of
his
thin
hand
which
he
had
laid
on
his
shoulders
and
ulrich
continued
my
single
joy
now
rests
in
my
activity
as
a
politician
of
course
it
means
incessant
and
untiring
labour
you
know
what
commissions
are
but
the
seed
is
sown
and
by
easter
we
may
expect
results
probably
our
object
will
have
been
gained
but
there
is
an
enormous
amount
to
be
done
and
i
shall
be
of
more
use
in
berlin
than
anywhere
else
now
listen
when
i
left
home
six
weeks
ago
you
seemed
to
me
to
be
all
right
you
might
have
been
a
little
grave
for
you
but
you
talked
reasonably
and
your
eye
was
clear
and
now
i
am
back
and
find
you
in
such
a
state
that
i
can
not
forbear
saying
to
myself
looks
as
if
he
were
going
to
the
devil
well
i
am
at
liberty
to
do
so
if
i
please
laughed
leo
i
do
envy
you
that
liberty
my
boy
ulrich
replied
yet
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
even
if
i
have
lost
your
confidence
and
you
treat
me
as
an
intruder
things
would
not
have
come
to
such
a
pass
with
you
if
i
had
been
at
home
what
fault
have
you
to
find
with
me
am
i
not
to
be
trusted
out
of
your
sight
soon
after
the
new
year
i
am
going
away
again
goodness
knows
how
i
shall
find
you
when
i
come
back
stony
broke
laughed
leo
feeling
his
irritation
grow
ulrich
closed
his
eyes
moved
to
emotion
by
this
insane
burst
of
on
leo
part
then
after
a
moment
he
asked
would
you
like
to
travel
again
no
was
the
short
rejoinder
very
good
shall
i
not
go
away
then
would
it
be
any
help
to
you
to
feel
that
i
was
near
at
hand
leo
gave
him
a
quick
look
in
which
eager
hope
and
anguish
were
mingled
but
then
he
answered
turning
his
head
aside
impatiently
thank
you
i
am
not
in
need
of
a
keeper
ulrich
blanched
i
hope
he
said
pronouncing
his
words
with
difficulty
that
you
do
mean
what
you
say
i
offer
to
sacrifice
for
you
my
goal
my
ambition
all
that
i
strive
and
live
for
and
you
give
me
an
answer
which
is
an
insult
to
me
and
our
friendship
i
am
not
sure
now
whether
to
treat
you
as
a
sick
man
or
a
stranger
there
was
a
silence
leo
had
risen
and
stood
motionless
with
his
fists
resting
on
the
table
the
feeling
of
impotence
and
vacillation
which
so
often
overcame
him
was
at
this
moment
a
positive
physical
martyrdom
softer
sentiments
welled
up
within
him
but
all
expression
of
tenderness
was
repressed
by
the
stern
necessity
of
deceiving
his
friend
a
course
to
which
he
was
eternally
committed
to
yield
a
jot
would
be
half
a
confession
you
take
everything
too
tragically
he
said
in
a
jocular
tone
idleness
does
suit
me
that
is
all
i
who
am
used
to
all
sorts
of
escapades
and
a
life
of
adventure
and
movement
am
simply
bored
now
and
ca
help
it
inactivity
makes
my
blood
sluggish
and
gives
me
horrid
thoughts
wait
till
the
spring
and
i
shall
be
myself
again
he
grasped
ulrich
hand
timidly
and
received
in
return
a
long
and
searching
pressure
it
was
as
if
ulrich
felt
to
his
the
unaccountable
change
in
his
friend
they
began
to
speak
of
general
topics
of
agriculture
and
political
affairs
but
leo
could
not
recover
his
equilibrium
his
conversation
was
a
mixture
one
moment
it
lacked
confidence
the
next
it
showed
an
excess
of
zeal
cynical
jokes
alternated
with
dull
platitudes
and
ulrich
was
more
and
more
perplexed
they
parted
leo
with
a
sensation
of
relief
that
the
interview
had
come
to
an
end
ulrich
sad
and
depressed
he
recognised
with
sorrow
that
this
friendship
which
as
long
as
he
could
remember
had
been
part
of
his
being
which
had
survived
triumphantly
leo
four
years
of
absence
and
his
own
marriage
with
rhaden
beautiful
widow
was
now
in
danger
of
being
dissolved
the
future
filled
him
with
fears
but
he
did
not
dream
that
on
the
threshold
of
his
home
there
awaited
him
a
blow
so
unexpected
and
so
terrible
that
it
would
drive
all
the
gloomy
impressions
of
from
his
mind
when
he
arrived
at
uhlenfelde
he
found
felicitas
lying
on
the
floor
in
hysterics
with
old
minna
tending
her
amidst
wailing
and
lamentations
half
an
hour
before
a
telegram
had
come
for
him
from
wiesbaden
and
had
been
opened
by
his
wife
it
ran
your
son
paul
is
seriously
ill
owing
to
an
unfortunate
accident
for
which
the
school
authorities
are
in
no
wise
to
blame
he
ran
away
on
christmas
eve
probably
homesick
was
found
in
a
neighbouring
village
where
he
was
being
cared
for
high
fever
and
doctor
earnestly
requests
you
will
come
immediately
xxxiii
the
sad
news
reached
leo
in
a
note
which
ulrich
despatched
the
same
night
from
the
station
at
münsterberg
felicitas
it
said
suffers
so
intensely
that
it
was
impossible
to
take
her
with
me
her
uncontrolled
grief
might
also
be
bad
for
the
child
so
if
you
feel
that
you
can
and
still
care
to
do
anything
please
help
her
that
was
a
hard
thrust
if
you
still
care
leo
was
terribly
upset
and
a
dull
gnawing
made
him
feel
as
if
he
were
to
blame
for
the
turn
events
had
taken
he
steeled
himself
to
write
a
long
letter
to
felicitas
in
which
under
the
pretext
of
ordinary
sympathy
he
put
his
time
and
his
person
at
her
disposal
and
offered
to
share
her
sorrow
as
brother
and
friend
he
awaited
her
answer
fearful
that
she
might
accept
but
he
need
not
have
been
afraid
her
note
contained
only
a
few
words
of
entreaty
to
him
to
stay
away
for
god
sake
do
come
she
wrote
i
can
only
pray
and
weep
night
and
day
you
are
the
last
person
i
wish
to
see
whereupon
he
asked
his
mother
to
take
compassion
on
the
heartbroken
mistress
of
uhlenfelde
the
good
old
lady
deeply
pitiful
set
out
at
once
on
her
mission
but
felicitas
refused
to
see
her
four
days
full
of
awful
suspense
went
by
leo
sent
a
messenger
twice
daily
to
uhlenfelde
to
inquire
and
he
brought
back
tidings
gleaned
from
old
minna
that
the
telegrams
from
wiesbaden
still
gave
hope
but
the
case
was
a
grave
one
the
gracious
mistress
was
confined
to
her
bed
and
prayed
the
doctor
from
münsterberg
visited
her
every
day
the
hours
between
one
piece
of
news
and
the
next
seemed
an
eternity
leo
did
know
what
else
to
do
but
shoulder
his
gun
and
stride
aimlessly
over
the
snowy
fields
he
passed
the
time
by
oracular
questionings
as
to
whether
the
child
would
live
or
die
he
counted
the
poplars
by
the
the
hares
running
across
the
furrows
and
the
buttons
on
his
he
counted
the
number
of
breaths
he
must
draw
before
he
reached
a
certain
spot
the
sunbeams
that
pierced
the
dusky
undergrowth
of
the
fir
woods
and
the
cries
of
the
ravens
that
echoed
through
the
silent
forest
a
monotonous
game
with
varied
results
he
made
vows
too
that
were
the
next
moment
forgotten
now
and
then
he
was
demoniacally
jubilant
and
sent
a
whoop
over
the
meadows
and
was
startled
at
the
echo
of
his
own
voice
in
the
evenings
he
turned
into
the
prussian
crown
for
distraction
and
drank
in
the
company
of
its
frequenters
enormous
quantities
of
grog
and
red
wine
with
two
cognacs
in
between
the
two
cognacs
went
by
the
name
of
a
pair
of
flannel
trousers
there
he
found
his
old
friends
hans
von
sembritzky
who
had
drunk
heavily
since
his
marriage
the
elder
otzen
a
melancholic
shy
personage
by
day
but
at
night
after
the
second
bottle
a
wild
singer
of
comic
songs
herr
von
stolt
always
on
the
scent
of
women
and
hoping
through
associating
with
leo
to
approach
felicitas
once
more
nothing
had
leaked
out
here
of
the
misfortune
which
had
befallen
uhlenfelde
even
ulrich
sudden
departure
had
called
for
no
remark
because
as
one
of
the
social
magnates
of
the
district
his
absences
were
frequent
the
only
person
who
knew
was
senftleben
who
attended
felicitas
this
taciturn
old
bachelor
who
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
a
cynic
and
was
much
feared
in
consequence
was
in
the
habit
of
devouring
his
supper
in
a
corner
of
the
prussian
crown
and
going
away
without
saying
good
night
to
any
one
leo
however
ventured
to
speak
to
him
one
night
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
with
felicitas
nothing
answered
the
doctor
and
seized
his
hat
but
she
is
in
bed
and
you
see
her
every
day
she
has
what
you
call
fever
herr
von
sellenthin
she
is
taking
morphine
in
raspberry
syrup
plenty
of
raspberry
but
no
bromide
that
is
too
depressing
good
evening
herr
von
sellenthin
on
the
morning
of
the
fifth
day
when
leo
was
dressing
lizzie
old
factotum
rushed
in
upon
him
sobbing
and
wringing
her
hands
what
has
happened
minna
misfortune
upon
misfortune
paulchen
is
dead
the
gnädige
frau
has
taken
poison
in
her
despair
and
though
still
alive
is
unconscious
the
doctor
has
been
sent
for
but
for
god
sake
come
gnädiger
herr
for
everything
is
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
leo
felt
as
if
cold
water
were
running
down
his
back
and
he
reeled
against
the
wall
it
ca
be
true
it
ca
be
true
was
his
first
thought
then
he
said
to
himself
you
must
put
on
your
boots
and
he
went
about
the
simple
task
with
a
feeling
as
if
in
another
minute
he
would
lack
the
strength
to
accomplish
it
suddenly
he
burst
into
a
loud
derisive
laugh
and
the
old
woman
crept
into
a
corner
frightened
at
the
sound
after
all
it
was
only
what
was
to
be
expected
it
was
fate
the
child
dead
felicitas
dying
ulrich
with
his
weak
heart
unable
to
bear
the
blow
and
then
it
would
be
his
own
turn
he
glanced
at
the
spot
where
his
weapons
hung
the
bullet
that
would
do
the
work
was
waiting
for
him
he
stretched
himself
and
a
murderous
lust
overcame
him
for
a
moment
then
he
finished
his
dressing
and
leaving
the
old
woman
panting
behind
he
tore
across
the
fields
and
over
the
frozen
river
to
uhlenfelde
and
as
he
ran
he
asked
himself
do
i
love
her
and
the
answer
was
no
love
is
like
this
i
am
not
even
sorry
for
her
my
guilt
if
she
dies
seems
far
worse
than
her
death
itself
but
the
child
and
ulrich
in
thinking
of
them
too
the
hideous
spectre
of
his
own
guilt
reared
itself
grimacing
before
him
everything
in
the
courtyard
at
uhlenfelde
was
the
same
as
usual
which
surprised
him
he
expected
at
least
that
the
barns
would
be
on
fire
a
sleigh
was
waiting
at
the
door
who
is
there
he
inquired
of
old
wilhelm
who
red
and
half
frozen
touched
his
fur
cap
with
his
customary
imperturbable
air
of
deference
the
doctor
gnädiger
herr
leo
met
him
in
the
hall
hurrying
after
the
manner
of
busy
doctors
to
his
conveyance
how
is
she
doctor
he
asked
detaining
him
as
well
as
can
be
expected
was
the
curt
reply
what
does
that
mean
that
all
danger
is
past
it
means
that
the
baroness
is
simply
suffering
from
an
attack
of
bile
which
i
do
envy
her
has
she
taken
poison
poison
humph
my
dear
sir
it
depends
on
what
you
call
poison
the
baroness
may
have
had
the
intention
of
taking
her
life
i
dare
say
but
she
went
the
wrong
way
about
it
she
drank
her
toothache
drops
herr
von
sellenthin
a
mixture
of
ether
alcohol
and
oil
not
exactly
unpleasant
to
the
taste
but
one
that
few
would
be
of
sufficiently
tough
constitution
not
to
feel
some
disagreeable
effects
from
imbibing
now
she
seems
to
have
slept
herself
out
but
will
probably
suffer
a
day
or
two
yet
from
a
disordered
stomach
good
day
to
you
herr
von
sellenthin
he
got
into
the
sleigh
bowed
and
drove
off
leo
felt
disgusted
and
half
disappointed
the
most
sacred
spot
in
his
heart
seemed
to
have
been
rudely
tampered
with
the
tragedy
had
become
something
very
like
a
farce
still
the
child
the
dear
child
was
dead
there
was
no
getting
over
that
the
wrath
which
always
flamed
up
within
him
against
this
woman
at
moments
when
his
will
was
weakest
and
most
impotent
to
meet
her
hardened
into
cold
aversion
he
could
have
strangled
her
on
account
of
those
toothache
drops
everything
even
the
desire
to
die
became
in
her
hands
a
miserable
petty
fraud
but
the
child
was
dead
and
could
not
be
brought
back
to
life
he
asked
a
who
was
apparently
affected
by
the
general
alarm
in
the
household
whether
her
mistress
was
visible
she
answered
shyly
that
she
would
go
and
see
and
ran
upstairs
meanwhile
old
minna
coughing
and
sobbing
came
in
at
the
front
door
and
asked
wringing
her
hands
if
the
gracious
one
was
still
alive
leo
turned
his
back
on
her
without
deigning
to
answer
and
she
hobbled
on
up
the
stairs
as
fast
as
she
could
he
was
alone
and
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
any
one
came
he
paced
up
and
down
between
the
pillars
where
he
and
ulrich
as
boys
had
played
and
he
thought
what
shame
have
she
and
i
brought
on
your
house
it
would
have
come
almost
as
a
consolation
if
some
one
had
hounded
him
with
a
out
at
the
door
the
threshold
of
which
his
feet
had
desecrated
instead
old
minna
returned
with
beaming
eyes
and
champing
jaws
and
declared
joyously
that
the
gracious
little
mistress
was
better
again
and
the
gracious
little
mistress
wished
to
see
him
he
clenched
his
teeth
and
followed
the
old
woman
upstairs
what
he
wanted
to
say
to
her
he
did
not
know
he
was
only
aware
of
a
dull
desire
to
lay
his
fingers
about
her
throat
and
choke
her
so
bitterly
at
that
moment
did
he
hate
her
minna
led
him
into
her
bedroom
he
had
not
entered
it
since
the
days
at
fichtkampen
a
wave
of
the
opoponax
perfume
met
him
as
the
door
opened
and
he
found
himself
in
a
rosy
gloaming
penetrated
here
and
there
by
a
ray
of
hard
cold
daylight
he
felt
as
if
he
were
plunged
into
a
warm
scented
bath
and
a
cover
shut
down
upon
him
he
remained
stationary
by
the
door
and
breathed
quickly
the
old
hag
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
and
pulled
him
forward
towards
the
bed
where
she
lay
her
face
was
illumined
by
the
light
from
the
window
and
her
pillow
gleamed
round
her
like
an
aureole
while
the
rest
of
the
bed
was
bathed
in
purple
semidarkness
she
has
arranged
this
en
he
thought
her
face
had
a
waxen
hue
there
were
dark
rims
round
her
eyes
which
from
beneath
their
heavy
lids
looked
at
him
without
recognition
or
intelligence
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
effects
of
her
had
not
entirely
passed
off
he
approached
her
bedside
on
the
thawing
snow
fell
from
his
boots
and
left
little
discoloured
streams
on
the
carpet
felicitas
she
raised
her
left
hand
and
motioned
to
him
to
come
nearer
and
he
dragged
a
chair
close
to
the
bed
there
was
a
standing
beside
it
with
bottles
and
phials
of
every
description
one
was
empty
and
labelled
cure
for
toothache
to
be
this
admonition
must
have
induced
her
to
drink
it
felicitas
he
repeated
then
she
slowly
raised
her
large
dim
eyes
and
stared
at
him
while
a
bitter
smile
played
about
her
mouth
felicitas
pull
yourself
together
he
exhorted
feeling
uneasy
she
stammered
paulchen
name
and
looked
into
vacancy
again
a
reflection
of
death
seemed
to
lie
on
this
white
face
rigid
from
anguish
leo
would
have
sunk
on
his
knees
beside
her
deeply
moved
and
anxious
had
not
the
doctor
words
hardened
and
steeled
him
against
her
leo
she
whispered
without
looking
at
him
what
can
i
do
for
you
are
you
my
friend
of
course
you
know
that
i
am
leo
i
ca
go
on
living
leo
you
must
get
me
poison
he
took
comfort
from
her
words
after
all
then
she
had
seriously
wished
to
take
her
life
for
that
he
thanked
her
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
a
quiver
of
pain
passed
over
her
drawn
features
which
the
grief
of
the
last
few
days
had
lengthened
and
pinched
her
face
was
now
marked
by
lines
which
made
it
look
older
but
gave
it
more
character
this
was
not
the
laughing
face
of
the
syren
who
lured
him
on
to
the
edge
of
a
precipice
but
the
face
of
a
madonna
who
had
endured
and
come
through
much
tribulation
and
it
was
fitting
that
the
partner
of
his
guilt
should
be
thus
he
felt
for
the
first
time
how
thoroughly
she
belonged
to
him
and
his
hate
gradually
evaporated
do
sin
against
yourself
felicitas
he
said
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
sin
against
myself
she
repeated
speaking
in
a
low
hopeless
monotone
oh
my
god
as
if
there
was
anything
worse
for
me
to
do
could
i
sin
more
than
i
have
done
my
little
paul
is
dead
and
i
am
still
alive
i
sentenced
my
child
to
death
and
am
allowed
to
live
matricide
is
that
the
most
horrible
of
crimes
how
can
i
go
through
life
with
such
a
burden
of
guilt
weighing
upon
me
how
can
any
one
who
cares
for
me
wish
me
to
do
it
matricide
he
exclaimed
in
bewilderment
what
do
you
mean
i
know
what
i
mean
she
said
and
smiled
a
cold
shudder
ran
through
him
this
woman
brain
must
be
unbalanced
by
grief
she
was
going
out
of
her
mind
her
fingers
groped
on
the
counterpane
where
is
your
hand
she
whispered
give
me
your
hand
i
implore
you
to
give
me
your
hand
he
stretched
it
towards
her
mechanically
and
she
grasped
it
in
her
hot
moist
palm
lean
down
to
me
she
whispered
on
and
i
will
tell
you
in
your
ear
how
it
happened
he
inclined
his
head
as
she
commanded
till
it
was
close
to
her
mouth
you
remember
that
evening
you
came
before
christmas
she
continued
that
was
the
hour
when
i
sacrificed
my
boy
life
to
you
when
we
were
warming
ourselves
at
the
furnace
in
the
greenhouse
it
was
then
that
he
died
you
are
talking
deliriously
felicitas
he
exclaimed
drawing
himself
erect
hush
she
said
pulling
him
down
to
her
again
they
may
be
listening
at
the
door
and
no
one
must
know
this
but
you
and
i
it
was
three
days
before
christmas
i
was
doing
up
his
presents
and
there
was
much
time
for
i
had
sent
him
far
far
away
for
your
sake
and
kept
from
ulrich
how
unhappy
he
was
at
school
for
your
sake
i
did
that
too
but
i
wanted
him
to
have
his
christmas
presents
but
in
the
middle
you
came
in
and
then
i
forgot
everything
else
i
thought
no
more
about
christmas
or
my
child
my
whole
soul
was
filled
with
you
i
wanted
nothing
else
but
to
go
away
with
you
into
some
corner
where
no
one
could
see
us
or
hear
us
and
when
you
were
gone
i
was
in
a
sort
of
mad
ecstasy
i
ran
up
and
down
stairs
i
stood
by
the
window
looking
towards
halewitz
half
the
night
through
and
then
i
sat
by
the
stove
and
stared
into
the
fire
and
thought
is
how
he
and
i
sat
beside
the
furnace
and
at
last
when
i
came
to
my
senses
it
was
too
late
too
late
why
too
late
he
asked
hoarsely
yesterday
morning
she
answered
ulrich
telegram
came
and
last
night
the
letter
everything
is
in
the
letter
it
is
somewhere
in
the
room
look
for
it
he
rose
with
faltering
steps
and
with
unsteady
fingers
fumbled
about
in
search
of
the
fatal
letter
but
he
could
not
find
it
he
ransacked
the
whole
apartment
that
lay
before
him
in
a
mysterious
twilight
with
its
luxurious
appointments
its
silken
cushions
and
covers
its
veiled
mirrors
and
countless
silver
and
ivory
toilette
articles
he
wandered
from
one
piece
of
furniture
to
another
and
while
he
gazed
in
stupefied
astonishment
at
all
the
glittering
knickknacks
he
asked
himself
what
it
was
he
was
looking
for
but
a
voice
from
the
bed
reminded
him
look
in
the
it
may
be
there
ah
the
letter
of
course
the
letter
he
opened
the
door
to
which
she
pointed
and
found
himself
in
a
small
room
so
brilliant
and
light
that
it
hurt
his
eyes
the
floor
was
of
porcelain
tiles
and
he
saw
on
the
left
a
bath
with
steps
leading
down
to
it
on
the
right
a
marble
table
surrounded
by
a
threefold
mirror
before
which
were
strewn
yet
more
articles
of
the
toilette
of
crystal
and
tortoiseshell
in
every
conceivable
design
how
must
hate
all
this
show
and
luxury
he
thought
and
then
his
glance
wandered
through
a
door
standing
wide
open
opposite
him
he
saw
a
plain
covered
by
a
white
crochet
counterpane
with
a
rug
on
the
bare
boards
beside
it
photographs
in
dark
frames
were
on
the
wall
and
amongst
them
staring
at
him
with
laughing
eyes
and
plump
cheeks
his
own
he
groaned
aloud
and
putting
his
hands
before
his
face
flew
back
into
the
perfumed
purple
prison
have
you
got
the
letter
she
asked
no
did
you
look
everywhere
i
do
know
i
think
so
leo
what
the
matter
with
you
her
voice
trembled
with
anxiety
the
matter
with
me
he
cried
only
this
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
ashamed
ashamed
he
drew
himself
up
and
then
flung
himself
down
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed
she
raised
herself
on
the
pillows
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
head
while
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
my
poor
poor
boy
she
said
you
are
already
and
yet
you
do
know
nearly
all
what
more
is
there
he
asked
shaken
with
emotion
the
letter
says
she
continued
that
all
the
others
got
their
presents
from
parents
and
friends
in
time
for
the
distribution
only
his
table
was
empty
and
he
could
believe
it
could
believe
that
his
mother
had
forgotten
him
and
when
the
rest
were
playing
round
the
he
slipped
out
unseen
without
hat
or
overcoat
he
must
go
to
the
he
said
to
inquire
whether
mamma
had
sent
nothing
not
the
soldiers
and
the
cannons
and
the
pocket
inkstand
and
all
the
things
that
he
had
wanted
so
badly
and
which
mamma
had
promised
him
but
he
could
find
the
and
ran
on
and
on
over
the
open
fields
in
a
snowstorm
cap
and
and
because
he
could
not
believe
that
his
mother
had
forsaken
him
for
your
sake
leo
he
died
died
she
pressed
her
forehead
against
the
bowed
head
of
the
kneeling
man
sobbing
bitterly
and
clung
to
his
shoulders
and
so
they
cried
together
and
would
not
be
comforted
when
at
last
they
lifted
their
heads
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
astonished
and
questioning
was
he
this
man
was
she
this
woman
it
seemed
as
if
their
common
sorrow
had
made
them
new
creatures
and
linked
them
as
one
for
all
time
in
guilt
and
the
wretched
consequence
of
their
sin
she
smiled
at
him
inconsolably
but
at
the
same
time
she
was
almost
happy
lizzie
we
are
lost
he
murmured
yes
we
are
lost
she
said
still
smiling
and
then
he
left
her
xxxiv
on
the
first
sunday
of
the
new
year
ulrich
alighted
at
the
station
at
münsterberg
after
seeing
the
grave
close
over
his
he
had
decided
after
long
consideration
to
have
the
boy
buried
in
the
place
where
he
died
and
if
his
wife
felt
herself
equal
to
the
strain
to
have
the
body
removed
later
to
be
interred
in
the
family
vault
of
the
rhadens
at
fichtkampen
felicitas
had
not
spared
him
any
of
the
details
of
her
despair
illness
and
attempted
suicide
and
had
painted
all
in
the
darkest
colours
she
had
too
much
to
conceal
to
be
able
to
express
her
grief
simply
and
sincerely
the
task
lay
before
her
of
excusing
herself
as
far
as
was
possible
of
any
blame
in
her
child
death
and
of
presenting
the
whole
unhappy
affair
to
ulrich
and
the
world
and
to
herself
tricked
out
in
the
guise
of
romance
above
all
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
to
spare
her
husband
the
letters
she
had
written
him
from
her
bed
with
a
feverish
hand
were
full
of
endless
laments
that
they
had
ever
sent
the
boy
so
far
away
to
school
which
strengthened
the
pangs
of
remorse
that
already
tortured
his
sensitive
soul
with
the
instinct
of
she
had
tried
to
shunt
the
responsibility
for
what
had
happened
on
ulrich
shoulders
in
the
same
way
as
she
had
blamed
leo
as
an
accomplice
so
that
ulrich
easily
disturbed
conscience
began
to
accuse
him
of
being
the
cause
of
all
the
misery
she
was
only
like
an
irresponsible
child
he
said
to
himself
following
the
whim
of
the
moment
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
and
have
remained
firm
in
opposing
her
even
when
it
was
the
fate
of
her
own
flesh
and
blood
that
she
was
deciding
upon
and
then
what
was
worst
of
all
was
that
she
had
done
it
for
him
and
him
alone
so
that
he
might
continue
to
enjoy
the
friendship
of
the
man
who
bore
on
him
the
stain
of
having
killed
the
child
father
that
child
had
been
sent
into
banishment
to
meet
his
death
a
sacrifice
so
cruel
and
unnatural
had
as
it
was
bound
to
be
been
avenged
and
as
things
had
shaped
themselves
it
had
all
been
of
no
avail
the
object
for
which
the
stupendous
sacrifice
had
been
made
was
not
attained
for
he
could
no
longer
shut
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
he
was
losing
his
friend
his
boyhood
comrade
and
who
ever
since
he
could
remember
had
been
first
in
his
thoughts
who
had
been
his
pride
and
glory
and
rock
of
strength
who
seemed
to
embody
all
the
health
and
physical
power
that
fate
had
denied
to
himself
he
no
longer
understood
him
the
laws
that
governed
his
emotions
were
strange
to
him
and
what
once
had
seemed
to
him
like
a
perfect
rushing
harmony
of
mother
nature
now
was
like
a
shrieking
confusion
of
discordant
notes
whether
it
was
himself
who
had
changed
so
much
or
the
other
he
could
say
he
was
only
clear
on
one
point
that
every
fresh
utterance
of
leo
estranged
and
hurt
him
no
one
knew
better
than
his
friend
how
dear
the
small
had
been
to
his
heart
but
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
he
had
got
a
letter
from
leo
so
stiffly
and
frigidly
expressed
that
it
might
have
been
the
conventional
condolences
of
an
absolute
stranger
it
was
indeed
a
melancholy
for
ulrich
no
one
met
him
at
the
station
but
the
who
recognised
the
baron
as
he
flashed
his
lantern
upon
him
helped
him
out
of
the
and
spoke
a
few
words
of
respectful
sympathy
the
old
coachman
wilhelm
seated
on
the
box
wiped
away
his
tears
at
his
master
approach
and
when
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
ah
wilhelm
we
shall
not
see
our
boy
again
he
nearly
let
the
reins
slip
out
of
his
hands
from
emotion
ulrich
had
brought
back
with
him
paulchen
trunks
and
play
boxes
and
these
were
piled
high
on
the
back
seat
of
the
sleigh
among
them
were
the
two
big
christmas
parcels
of
toys
which
the
little
fellow
had
looked
out
for
so
expectantly
on
christmas
eve
and
gone
in
search
of
they
had
been
delivered
the
next
day
by
the
pleased
postman
the
sleigh
glided
on
through
the
moonless
night
on
the
plain
the
whiteness
of
the
snow
made
a
faint
glimmer
the
poplars
bordering
the
road
emerged
in
blurred
outline
one
after
the
other
out
of
the
dark
ulrich
fancied
that
from
behind
each
tree
paulchen
must
appear
and
call
to
him
take
me
home
i
am
afraid
so
afraid
take
me
home
please
then
came
the
long
bridge
which
had
been
paulchen
delight
it
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
paces
in
length
and
had
balustrades
of
black
and
white
palings
on
which
he
had
always
said
that
he
wanted
to
climb
when
he
was
big
enough
underneath
the
bridge
where
it
was
often
dry
enough
to
walk
there
was
an
echo
and
when
a
carriage
passed
overhead
it
was
like
the
rolling
of
thunder
and
a
little
further
on
was
the
chief
wonder
of
the
road
a
windmill
that
stood
on
a
roof
think
of
it
a
windmill
high
up
on
a
roof
forlornly
it
spread
its
snowy
wings
now
like
the
ghost
of
a
giant
stretching
its
arms
into
the
grey
night
sky
so
the
drive
continued
till
the
demesne
of
uhlenfelde
came
in
sight
here
there
seemed
scarcely
an
inch
of
land
that
was
not
sanctified
by
some
association
with
the
dead
boy
how
gloomy
and
desolate
were
the
wide
fields
they
looked
as
if
a
bright
day
could
never
dawn
again
to
bathe
them
in
sunshine
as
if
eternal
winter
had
settled
on
the
world
he
looked
forward
to
the
prospect
that
awaited
him
with
shuddering
he
dreaded
alike
his
work
and
his
leisure
then
he
thought
of
felicitas
and
was
ashamed
of
thinking
so
much
of
his
own
feelings
the
task
before
him
was
to
coax
with
gentle
patience
and
tactful
caution
a
despairing
woman
slowly
back
to
the
ordinary
walks
of
life
a
burst
of
compassionate
love
for
her
gushed
forth
from
his
soul
he
felt
as
if
she
and
leo
were
a
legacy
left
to
him
by
the
poor
little
fellow
who
had
died
so
tragically
yes
with
leo
too
he
must
try
and
set
things
right
he
would
go
to
him
look
him
straight
in
the
eyes
clasp
his
hand
and
say
man
speak
out
and
over
the
dead
tell
me
honestly
what
is
the
barrier
that
has
grown
up
between
you
and
me
the
sleigh
turned
through
the
courtyard
gateway
the
servants
and
labourers
lined
the
drive
in
black
groups
and
in
silent
sympathy
bared
their
heads
all
had
foregone
their
beer
and
none
had
spent
the
sabbath
hours
of
repose
at
home
with
wife
and
child
because
they
all
wished
by
their
presence
there
to
show
him
how
they
felt
for
him
in
his
bereavement
the
sleigh
drew
up
his
heart
beat
faster
for
he
feared
felicitas
would
come
out
to
meet
him
but
she
did
not
come
she
was
waiting
for
him
in
her
standing
erect
by
the
her
deep
made
her
look
taller
she
appeared
to
him
almost
majestic
or
was
it
her
sorrow
which
invested
her
in
his
eyes
with
majesty
yet
the
expression
of
the
haggard
eyes
which
looked
bigger
than
ever
because
her
face
had
grown
so
thin
was
not
one
of
sorrow
rather
did
it
appear
to
be
anxiety
and
horror
that
gazed
out
of
them
as
if
she
feared
being
surprised
in
a
defenceless
position
lizzie
he
stammered
holding
out
his
arms
to
her
she
dropped
her
lids
and
leant
against
the
wall
for
support
he
drew
her
head
to
his
breast
and
led
her
to
an
murmuring
over
her
softly
words
of
comfort
all
the
love
with
which
his
heart
was
overflowing
he
lavished
upon
her
he
spoke
of
their
belonging
to
each
other
more
completely
than
ever
before
of
the
sacred
hallowing
influence
the
death
of
the
innocent
child
would
have
upon
both
their
lives
he
promised
to
give
her
for
the
future
boundless
confidence
most
fervent
trusty
and
tenderest
consideration
all
indeed
that
he
had
given
her
for
years
which
for
years
she
had
accepted
with
smiling
indifference
and
without
heeding
the
giver
so
soon
as
it
dawned
on
her
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
disposed
to
make
her
responsible
and
call
her
to
account
her
nervous
rigidity
relaxed
she
slid
on
to
the
carpet
and
burying
her
head
on
his
knees
sobbed
bitterly
he
went
on
speaking
to
her
in
the
same
soothing
gentle
tone
she
wrung
her
hands
and
beat
her
forehead
for
an
instant
her
maternal
grief
which
in
spite
of
everything
was
strong
within
her
had
full
sway
without
any
interrupting
it
but
her
expressions
were
so
wildly
exaggerated
that
soon
even
her
grief
became
artificial
and
the
last
remnant
of
pure
and
noble
sentiment
she
had
possessed
was
destroyed
gradually
she
grew
calmer
and
she
let
her
arms
fall
to
her
sides
a
lassitude
that
was
almost
pleasant
overcame
her
she
let
him
raise
her
and
lay
her
on
the
couch
she
felt
the
burning
desire
that
children
feel
after
a
whipping
to
be
pitied
and
consoled
oh
ulrich
she
murmured
what
i
have
suffered
he
started
a
sense
of
disappointment
suddenly
damped
his
sympathy
surely
at
this
hour
her
first
words
should
not
have
been
words
of
pity
for
herself
he
said
nothing
but
his
eyes
wandered
about
the
room
as
if
he
were
pondering
on
some
new
experience
supper
was
announced
the
officials
who
generally
sat
at
table
with
them
had
tactfully
begged
to
be
excused
husband
and
wife
were
alone
the
hummed
and
the
bronze
shed
a
soft
lustre
on
the
snowy
damask
and
gleaming
silver
felicitas
busied
herself
about
his
acting
on
an
impulse
to
pay
off
the
gigantic
debt
she
owed
him
with
the
small
coin
of
little
kindnesses
and
attentions
she
prepared
his
sardines
in
his
favourite
way
cut
him
the
thinnest
and
poured
two
spoonfuls
of
rum
in
his
tea
a
he
was
obliged
sometimes
to
resort
to
she
put
a
cushion
at
his
back
and
drew
the
shade
low
over
the
lamp
so
that
his
poor
tired
eyes
should
not
be
dazzled
he
watched
her
in
painful
amazement
he
would
have
preferred
satisfying
his
hunger
silently
and
unobserved
like
a
dog
and
not
to
have
been
reminded
that
there
were
such
things
as
dainty
living
and
in
the
world
how
can
she
think
of
these
trifling
matters
when
a
few
moments
ago
she
was
idling
on
the
floor
in
despair
he
asked
himself
with
a
fine
instinct
she
divined
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
and
changing
her
tack
began
again
to
give
a
harrowing
account
of
her
own
sufferings
no
ulrich
she
said
you
ca
conceive
what
torture
it
was
to
me
to
think
of
you
alone
at
his
grave
not
to
be
there
to
help
you
and
stand
by
you
but
it
could
not
be
helped
the
doctor
gave
strict
orders
that
i
was
not
to
attempt
the
journey
besides
i
was
very
ill
a
little
more
and
you
would
not
have
found
me
alive
she
paused
expecting
him
to
question
her
about
the
attempted
suicide
but
as
he
was
silent
she
led
the
conversation
round
to
it
herself
are
you
still
angry
with
me
dearest
she
asked
why
should
i
be
angry
because
i
acted
so
wickedly
and
in
the
first
shock
of
my
grief
doubted
god
and
his
mercy
so
that
i
believed
it
was
impossible
to
go
on
living
ah
ulrich
if
you
knew
the
state
i
was
in
then
you
would
i
am
sure
forgive
me
i
have
nothing
to
forgive
felicitas
but
you
say
it
so
severely
ulrich
i
know
of
course
that
i
have
committed
a
great
sin
that
one
ought
to
endure
patiently
any
misery
god
inflicts
on
us
but
i
was
so
alone
so
utterly
alone
you
away
no
one
to
turn
to
first
i
thought
of
throwing
myself
in
the
river
that
would
have
been
the
quickest
but
the
river
was
frozen
next
i
thought
i
would
roam
about
the
fields
and
freeze
to
death
and
i
did
stay
out
half
one
night
and
it
did
kill
me
and
so
i
came
home
and
snatched
up
some
poison
the
first
that
came
to
hand
and
drank
drank
it
was
like
liquid
fire
in
my
throat
and
i
saw
dancing
suns
before
my
eyes
and
then
i
fell
and
i
do
know
what
happened
afterwards
do
you
see
uli
what
a
terrible
time
your
poor
little
wife
has
gone
through
in
her
longing
to
hear
him
console
her
she
began
to
cry
once
more
but
the
desired
consolation
was
not
forthcoming
ah
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
she
lamented
further
if
i
had
never
awoke
what
is
life
nothing
but
sorrow
wretchedness
and
misunderstanding
when
one
heart
is
torn
one
is
always
most
alone
ah
uli
for
you
too
it
would
have
been
best
would
you
have
mourned
for
me
a
little
he
did
not
answer
he
looked
at
her
and
looked
again
and
she
turned
him
to
stone
he
had
been
waiting
for
the
bitter
cry
of
maternal
anguish
but
she
talked
of
herself
and
only
of
herself
his
eyes
beheld
her
in
her
fair
loveliness
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
on
her
chair
the
rounded
curves
of
her
slender
figure
were
set
off
by
the
her
masses
of
curly
golden
hair
shone
like
a
halo
above
her
forehead
and
small
rosy
ears
the
perpetual
smile
on
the
small
face
seemed
to
say
that
she
would
like
to
smile
all
death
and
pain
out
of
existence
he
was
conscious
of
a
slight
repulsion
as
he
examined
her
and
was
ashamed
of
it
the
next
moment
why
was
he
suddenly
become
so
embittered
had
he
not
always
known
that
patience
was
very
necessary
in
dealing
with
this
fair
light
creature
and
in
a
voice
more
of
reproach
than
blame
he
said
have
you
no
questions
to
ask
about
the
boy
felicitas
she
held
out
her
hands
in
horrified
entreaty
not
dearest
she
implored
not
it
would
excite
us
both
too
much
i
have
pictured
it
all
a
thousand
times
over
all
the
dreadful
scenes
have
floated
before
my
eyes
by
night
and
day
and
i
am
tired
oh
so
tired
i
crave
for
sleep
for
one
real
good
long
sleep
and
never
to
wake
again
how
beautiful
that
would
be
shutting
her
eyes
she
laid
herself
across
the
arm
of
the
chair
so
that
her
full
creamy
throat
dimpled
over
the
tight
folds
of
black
chiffon
that
encircled
it
again
he
had
to
struggle
with
a
feeling
of
disgust
but
with
a
quiet
determination
characteristic
of
his
methodical
nature
he
adhered
to
his
purpose
of
giving
her
an
account
of
paul
last
hours
our
feelings
ought
not
to
make
cowards
of
us
lizzie
he
said
i
know
you
must
have
suffered
much
i
should
have
known
it
even
if
you
had
not
told
me
but
it
is
in
vain
to
try
and
spare
yourself
this
our
thoughts
will
always
be
returning
to
it
and
not
till
you
have
drunk
your
cup
of
sorrow
to
the
dregs
can
you
hope
to
get
any
truly
refreshing
rest
very
well
speak
then
she
said
cowering
together
as
if
resigning
herself
to
her
fate
tell
me
what
you
like
but
when
he
saw
the
terror
with
which
she
contemplated
hearing
his
story
the
words
froze
on
his
lips
and
he
felt
as
if
he
could
never
impart
to
her
the
painful
and
sacred
impressions
that
were
so
fresh
in
his
memory
he
had
expected
that
she
would
have
drunk
in
all
with
passionate
eagerness
and
would
have
questioned
him
about
every
minute
that
he
had
passed
by
paul
deathbed
till
she
was
in
complete
possession
of
the
whole
scene
instead
she
shrank
from
it
in
a
vulgar
fear
of
her
nerves
being
upset
unmotherly
almost
inhuman
did
her
conduct
appear
now
he
felt
that
to
speak
of
the
child
quiet
pathetic
death
to
the
mother
would
be
profanation
though
there
had
been
no
tie
of
blood
between
them
he
had
belonged
to
him
in
life
and
in
death
this
woman
from
whose
womb
he
had
sprung
this
smiling
frightened
woman
who
only
thought
of
her
own
discomfort
and
wished
to
be
pitied
for
herself
had
become
a
stranger
a
stranger
to
her
child
and
a
stranger
to
him
he
saw
with
horror
the
gulf
that
she
set
between
him
and
her
which
no
seductive
charm
no
flattering
little
speeches
could
ever
bridge
again
perhaps
you
are
right
felicitas
he
said
coldly
we
will
leave
it
for
the
present
it
may
be
too
sad
a
subject
and
too
exciting
for
you
ah
how
good
you
are
she
whispered
gratefully
you
can
feel
for
your
poor
wife
and
as
she
had
often
done
when
she
wanted
to
bewitch
him
with
a
cheap
endearment
she
stretched
over
to
him
and
pillowed
her
head
against
his
arm
looking
into
his
face
with
ecstatically
uplifted
eyes
he
submitted
passively
and
glanced
down
in
cold
astonishment
on
the
pale
pretty
features
on
which
an
almost
coquettish
smile
was
now
playing
in
a
flash
he
seemed
to
see
through
the
thousand
machinations
with
which
for
years
she
had
chained
him
to
her
the
allurements
with
which
she
had
awakened
desires
within
him
without
any
intention
of
satisfying
them
and
the
extravagant
caprices
obeying
which
had
weakened
his
will
and
degraded
his
intellect
the
whole
tissue
woven
of
laughing
selfishness
and
affability
and
mock
now
fell
away
showing
the
being
he
had
humbly
worshipped
in
her
naked
unreality
and
insincerity
he
could
not
guess
that
all
she
said
and
did
at
the
moment
was
a
kind
of
veiled
apology
for
in
her
mania
to
excuse
her
past
faults
she
had
revealed
herself
to
him
in
her
true
colours
he
saw
all
that
was
hollow
and
vain
and
false
in
her
without
understanding
why
she
prevaricated
and
lied
they
sat
on
together
for
another
hour
the
table
was
cleared
but
the
still
hummed
the
antique
dutch
clock
in
the
corner
kept
up
its
solemn
and
deliberate
tick
now
and
then
a
shower
of
whirled
against
the
window
and
the
sashes
rattled
gently
a
profound
dreamful
peace
seemed
to
have
descended
on
the
apartment
a
peace
well
ordained
to
bring
healing
to
two
wounded
hearts
felicitas
all
unsuspecting
yet
inwardly
anxious
continued
to
make
herself
charming
and
amiable
she
spoke
of
the
sympathy
shown
her
by
friends
and
neighbours
the
countless
letters
of
condolence
which
she
had
received
the
many
callers
she
had
refused
to
see
she
even
made
plans
for
the
future
and
promised
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
to
comfort
and
distract
him
he
listened
with
grave
courteous
attention
and
in
every
word
he
found
confirmation
of
his
new
reading
of
her
character
his
eyes
wandered
round
the
room
he
saw
the
lights
and
shadows
dancing
on
the
walls
the
dear
old
objects
amidst
which
he
had
been
brought
up
which
he
would
have
bequeathed
to
his
so
soon
as
he
could
have
legally
adopted
him
he
listened
to
the
ticking
of
the
clock
and
all
the
familiar
sounds
which
in
peaceful
evening
hours
are
the
music
of
happy
homes
but
now
everything
seemed
different
everything
was
strange
unreal
almost
disquieting
away
a
voice
cried
within
him
flee
from
this
house
which
is
no
longer
yours
and
when
the
watchmen
whistled
outside
the
hour
of
ten
he
rose
his
torture
had
lasted
long
enough
she
offered
her
forehead
to
be
kissed
with
a
weary
sigh
but
he
bowed
low
and
kissed
her
hand
instead
and
you
really
are
angry
with
me
she
asked
in
a
whisper
her
conscience
stirring
again
he
shook
his
head
smiling
the
scorn
which
had
taken
possession
of
his
soul
made
him
composed
and
frigid
he
left
her
and
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
she
threw
up
her
hands
and
exclaimed
thank
god
the
next
morning
ulrich
explained
to
his
wife
that
urgent
business
called
him
to
königsberg
where
the
committee
for
the
agricultural
exhibition
was
holding
its
meetings
and
it
was
uncertain
whether
he
would
return
to
uhlenfelde
before
the
opening
of
the
reichstag
felicitas
was
at
first
a
little
taken
aback
then
readily
acquiesced
the
parting
of
husband
and
wife
was
friendly
but
undemonstrative
felicitas
indeed
regarded
the
separation
so
much
in
the
light
of
a
deliverance
that
she
forgot
to
act
a
part
when
the
sleigh
reached
the
top
of
the
dyke
ulrich
halted
and
took
a
long
look
across
at
halewitz
whose
hoary
old
castle
seemed
to
nod
a
greeting
at
him
amidst
its
barns
and
though
his
heart
cried
out
for
his
friend
he
was
afraid
to
meet
him
afraid
that
if
he
did
the
last
precious
thing
left
to
him
on
earth
might
slip
through
his
fingers
xxxv
in
these
days
leo
became
an
of
the
prussian
crown
he
was
received
there
with
open
arms
by
a
jovial
company
according
to
whose
standard
he
was
a
thoroughly
decent
chap
being
capable
of
drinking
as
hard
as
most
the
handful
of
uhlan
officers
could
talk
big
but
when
it
came
to
putting
their
prowess
to
the
test
by
a
genuine
prolonged
carousal
they
could
not
be
depended
on
and
dropped
out
of
the
ranks
before
the
struggle
had
really
half
begun
the
truth
was
that
the
colonel
in
command
had
strict
orders
to
guard
against
any
excesses
lest
the
demoralising
civilian
influence
should
bring
the
mixed
garrison
into
disrepute
the
citizens
were
on
the
whole
a
famous
crew
and
as
often
in
debt
and
in
drink
as
befitted
old
corps
students
one
it
was
true
held
himself
aloof
because
he
was
a
jew
and
feared
baiting
but
his
place
was
filled
by
a
newspaper
reporter
likewise
a
jew
who
adopted
opposite
tactics
and
with
the
plasticity
of
his
race
had
become
the
most
convivial
of
the
party
and
the
wildest
of
a
wild
lot
the
circle
was
sometimes
joined
by
a
couple
of
landed
proprietors
unable
to
put
in
a
regular
appearance
owing
to
their
wives
and
the
distance
of
their
homes
and
whose
presence
when
they
did
come
to
drink
away
dull
hours
added
to
the
gaiety
of
the
topers
as
beer
and
red
wine
were
considered
little
stronger
than
innocent
a
particularly
piquant
kind
of
punch
was
the
beverage
chosen
by
means
of
which
the
object
desired
was
most
quickly
accomplished
this
was
an
appalling
mixture
of
cognac
and
with
sugar
added
and
it
was
carried
to
the
table
piping
hot
the
man
had
never
been
met
with
yet
who
could
hold
out
against
the
peculiar
effects
of
this
devilish
concoction
and
every
time
that
the
punch
was
brewing
on
the
kitchen
fire
the
waiters
and
ostlers
received
orders
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
to
act
the
part
of
good
samaritan
to
the
guests
nevertheless
the
milieu
of
the
prussian
crown
was
a
little
too
steady
and
staid
for
some
tastes
certain
respectable
worthies
came
there
to
read
the
newspapers
have
a
game
of
cribbage
or
chess
and
their
request
for
quiet
had
perforce
to
be
regarded
another
drawback
was
the
lack
of
female
society
at
other
resorts
in
münsterberg
where
the
more
plebeian
revellers
sought
their
distractions
with
indifferent
beer
and
good
grog
were
to
be
found
ladies
with
whom
one
could
chat
behind
the
bar
at
engelmann
for
instance
was
the
barmaid
known
as
the
fair
ida
and
gretchen
nicknamed
the
toad
ogled
through
the
window
of
gambrinus
which
was
generally
empty
while
if
one
wanted
variety
there
was
the
restaurant
königgrätz
where
the
young
ladies
came
and
went
in
rapid
succession
johann
the
halewitz
coachman
had
waited
many
an
hour
of
late
freezing
on
his
box
before
the
curtained
windows
of
these
hostels
and
he
and
christian
had
entered
into
a
conspiracy
together
to
screen
their
master
and
hide
his
ruin
from
the
world
they
invented
a
hundred
excuses
for
his
late
and
lied
to
every
one
who
questioned
them
on
the
subject
yet
in
spite
of
that
all
the
servants
and
tenants
knew
their
master
had
become
a
drunkard
and
spent
his
nights
in
debauchery
and
there
was
no
surprise
after
the
scene
of
christmas
eve
which
had
impressed
itself
so
deeply
on
their
memory
in
the
castle
itself
the
evil
was
felt
without
the
cause
of
it
being
clearly
understood
its
inmates
were
in
terror
of
leo
sudden
outbursts
of
temper
his
growling
and
grumbling
when
his
behaviour
was
tolerable
the
poor
women
would
venture
hopefully
on
drawing
a
smile
or
a
kind
word
from
him
but
were
generally
roughly
repulsed
and
would
retire
from
the
attempt
with
tears
of
shame
and
indignation
in
their
eyes
dear
grandmamma
suffered
no
less
than
hertha
and
elly
and
her
fat
pug
between
them
got
well
bullied
but
there
was
no
one
who
suffered
as
much
as
himself
despite
his
efforts
to
be
a
fiend
he
remained
nothing
but
a
poor
wretch
bleeding
from
the
scourgings
of
a
martyr
to
feverish
longing
and
the
craving
of
the
senses
seeking
mental
and
physical
exhaustion
by
plunging
into
one
dissipation
after
the
other
the
idea
of
making
an
end
of
himself
grew
stronger
day
by
day
he
played
with
his
despairing
resolves
as
a
child
does
with
its
toys
sometimes
he
felt
as
if
he
must
commit
murder
and
a
favourite
occupation
of
his
distorted
mind
was
to
picture
himself
laying
hands
on
innocent
people
who
had
done
and
never
would
do
him
any
harm
but
whom
in
his
suspicious
irritability
he
chose
to
regard
as
enemies
and
slanderers
yes
murder
some
one
and
afterwards
go
to
gaol
and
the
gallows
that
would
be
peace
and
salvation
at
last
he
had
seen
no
more
of
felicitas
since
that
memorable
morning
she
had
twice
written
to
him
but
he
had
evaded
answering
her
the
last
remnants
of
his
strength
of
will
were
used
to
keep
up
this
cowardly
attitude
he
had
heard
from
ulrich
too
begging
him
to
forgive
him
for
not
having
looked
him
up
the
last
time
he
was
at
home
this
made
him
laugh
his
harshest
laugh
if
they
had
met
what
a
delightful
meeting
it
would
have
been
it
was
at
this
time
that
something
happened
to
rouse
him
from
the
contemplation
of
his
own
degradation
his
old
friend
fat
and
honest
hans
von
sembritzky
drew
him
cautiously
one
day
at
the
prussian
crown
into
a
corner
and
said
puffing
and
short
of
breath
a
word
with
you
old
man
although
it
is
not
a
very
serious
matter
in
itself
and
may
not
mean
much
you
ought
to
look
after
your
little
sister
elly
a
bit
she
is
just
at
the
age
you
know
when
girls
do
silly
things
at
any
rate
it
would
be
wise
to
keep
out
of
her
way
ink
is
rather
a
dangerous
medium
for
flirtation
leo
half
alarmed
and
half
annoyed
demanded
an
explanation
you
know
pastor
brenckenberg
cub
who
has
been
loafing
about
at
home
for
more
than
a
year
doing
no
good
swaggering
corps
student
boasts
of
his
colours
and
his
clubs
but
to
what
purpose
the
fellow
gets
more
and
more
dissipated
and
dissolute
and
he
dare
not
show
his
nose
now
in
any
decent
house
even
the
bailiffs
are
sick
of
him
and
no
wonder
as
leo
interrupted
with
a
brusque
suggestion
that
he
should
come
to
the
point
well
my
bailiff
lawrence
a
thoroughly
honest
and
reliable
person
told
me
yesterday
that
the
kandidate
brenckenberg
had
been
passing
round
his
from
little
elly
sellenthin
in
a
beer
cellar
at
münsterberg
and
had
also
read
passages
from
them
aloud
some
of
the
company
had
been
amused
others
indignant
in
short
the
affair
has
caused
a
scandal
leo
felt
a
sense
of
cruel
triumph
mingle
with
his
rage
he
had
wanted
some
object
that
he
could
crush
pulverize
and
annihilate
and
here
he
had
one
to
his
hand
hans
was
astonished
at
the
loud
laughter
with
which
he
greeted
his
information
and
a
little
hurt
you
do
seem
to
take
the
matter
seriously
he
remarked
wait
a
bit
old
fellow
only
wait
said
he
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
then
he
sat
down
and
drank
deeply
while
his
friend
shook
his
head
and
privately
deplored
his
rapid
degeneration
at
first
leo
intended
to
give
his
sister
a
scolding
but
when
on
the
following
day
he
was
face
to
face
with
her
he
had
lost
the
desire
to
humiliate
her
why
draw
forth
tears
and
wailings
from
this
child
when
the
youth
was
in
his
power
better
reserve
himself
for
that
encounter
he
confined
himself
therefore
to
taking
hold
of
her
by
the
arm
and
teazing
her
by
a
hundred
taunts
and
gibes
he
felt
a
kind
of
malicious
sympathy
with
her
had
she
after
all
done
anything
very
bad
he
who
was
on
the
to
ruin
and
fully
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
could
not
be
hard
on
this
little
fool
for
stumbling
in
the
blindness
of
her
youthful
pursuit
of
enjoyment
so
when
he
had
tormented
her
sufficiently
he
kissed
her
and
let
her
go
this
had
happened
shortly
after
the
was
over
a
little
later
hertha
pale
from
suppressed
excitement
came
to
him
with
a
letter
from
johanna
his
eldest
sister
wrote
that
she
had
things
of
urgent
importance
to
speak
to
him
about
and
prayed
that
on
the
receipt
of
her
note
he
would
come
to
her
immediately
she
may
congratulate
herself
that
i
can
obey
her
summons
he
thought
but
in
spite
of
his
feigned
scorn
and
indifference
he
knew
that
he
was
afraid
of
johanna
or
if
not
of
her
of
the
discomfort
with
which
she
always
threatened
him
for
a
reminder
from
johanna
that
she
existed
meant
nothing
pleasant
a
sudden
current
of
vigorous
life
shot
through
his
limbs
and
told
him
how
much
he
could
still
hate
he
hated
her
and
felicitas
and
every
one
but
her
most
of
all
he
put
on
his
fur
coat
and
strode
over
the
park
it
was
nearly
four
the
pale
winter
sun
was
sinking
and
scarcely
able
to
illumine
the
monotonous
greyness
of
the
fields
with
its
feeble
parting
rays
though
here
and
there
there
trembled
over
the
landscape
a
reflection
the
shrubberies
seemed
like
black
crouching
figures
on
the
ground
and
between
the
highest
straggling
branches
the
light
peeped
like
a
thousand
round
eyes
the
girls
had
made
a
slide
on
the
snowy
surface
of
the
carp
pond
and
it
spanned
it
like
a
narrow
dark
ribbon
from
bank
to
bank
absently
leo
slid
along
the
slide
and
considered
himself
lucky
that
he
got
to
the
other
side
without
a
fall
he
recalled
the
sultry
afternoon
on
which
he
had
smoked
his
cigar
here
stretched
out
on
the
seat
and
had
awaited
with
perfect
calm
the
interview
with
his
sister
the
seat
was
now
cushioned
with
snow
on
which
the
footmarks
of
birds
had
made
a
pattern
he
felt
inclined
to
throw
himself
down
there
again
in
spite
of
the
snow
and
try
to
recover
the
equable
frame
of
mind
that
he
had
been
in
then
ah
but
she
wo
get
off
so
well
this
time
he
thought
and
he
made
his
way
along
the
overgrown
path
that
led
to
the
dower
house
she
stood
at
the
window
waiting
for
him
as
he
entered
the
room
she
turned
round
and
biting
her
lips
gave
him
a
cold
glassy
stare
she
had
aged
still
more
since
he
had
last
seen
her
and
seemed
more
gaunt
and
wasted
the
flesh
on
her
throat
hung
in
folds
and
the
sharp
line
of
pain
from
mouth
to
chin
completely
marred
the
oval
of
her
face
the
greyish
side
light
which
fell
upon
her
gave
a
hue
to
her
complexion
peculiar
to
people
who
are
fitting
themselves
for
the
next
world
by
ascetic
exercises
and
to
those
who
have
imposed
on
themselves
some
great
mental
strain
so
this
is
where
you
prefer
to
dwell
he
said
and
looked
round
him
he
saw
the
white
crucifix
in
its
corner
with
the
in
front
of
it
and
heavy
pieces
of
furniture
on
which
the
fading
daylight
lay
unbecomingly
the
odour
of
poor
children
which
the
scholars
had
left
behind
them
almost
suffocated
him
and
with
it
was
mingled
the
smell
of
dried
grasses
and
mouldy
please
sit
down
johanna
said
without
offering
him
her
hand
there
was
a
weary
sad
almost
tearful
sound
in
her
voice
which
was
new
to
him
also
the
manner
in
which
she
went
to
the
sofa
and
slowly
sank
amongst
the
cushions
seemed
the
action
of
one
physically
weak
and
broken
in
spirit
i
have
asked
you
to
come
here
she
began
so
that
you
shall
know
god
decision
with
regard
to
us
for
what
is
about
to
happen
is
the
judgment
of
god
i
have
no
will
in
the
matter
except
to
do
his
bequest
but
you
shall
not
be
able
to
reproach
me
with
having
dealt
this
blow
from
behind
in
an
underhand
way
of
course
she
was
threatening
him
he
had
expected
nothing
else
well
what
is
it
now
he
inquired
suppressing
his
rising
antagonism
what
do
you
want
of
me
and
will
it
cost
me
much
you
pious
folks
have
your
own
prices
i
know
his
scoffing
raillery
had
no
effect
upon
her
look
here
leo
she
said
in
a
still
more
tired
and
subdued
voice
i
am
sorry
for
you
i
would
have
given
much
to
be
able
to
save
you
and
all
of
us
for
you
have
involved
us
all
in
your
ruin
but
there
is
no
contending
against
god
law
and
he
has
spoken
the
child
is
dead
do
you
know
why
the
child
died
leave
the
child
out
of
it
he
murmured
what
has
the
child
to
do
with
you
that
i
will
tell
you
leo
she
replied
stretching
her
languid
arm
towards
the
crucifix
on
that
spot
she
sentenced
the
child
to
death
and
she
did
it
for
your
sake
he
felt
as
if
some
one
had
struck
him
with
open
hand
on
the
forehead
he
tried
to
speak
but
his
thoughts
were
in
a
whirl
only
a
strangled
laugh
rose
from
his
throat
was
this
embittered
sister
of
charity
in
league
with
the
devil
that
she
could
divine
human
secrets
and
see
into
the
future
for
a
moment
a
deathlike
stillness
reigned
in
the
oppressive
room
which
was
filled
now
with
the
shadows
of
falling
dusk
johanna
kept
her
eyes
fixed
stonily
on
the
dark
corner
where
the
crucifix
stood
out
in
luminous
relief
like
a
witness
of
the
crime
on
that
spot
johanna
went
on
she
knelt
and
took
her
oath
and
i
believed
her
for
one
does
swear
falsely
on
the
head
of
one
own
child
and
you
were
both
warned
i
let
you
take
the
sacrament
together
so
that
you
both
should
be
quite
honest
in
your
good
resolutions
then
i
saw
how
wild
you
became
and
i
felt
anxious
and
the
child
was
still
alive
nothing
had
happened
god
will
speak
in
his
own
good
time
i
thought
and
day
after
day
i
sat
and
waited
for
the
child
to
die
then
it
did
die
and
i
knew
what
i
wanted
to
know
it
is
useless
for
you
to
defend
yourself
or
deny
anything
leo
god
has
spoken
and
i
believe
god
before
he
boiled
with
inarticulate
wrath
scarcely
knowing
what
words
he
could
use
to
lash
her
with
what
noble
conduct
what
sublimely
noble
conduct
he
snarled
to
sit
and
wait
like
a
cat
watching
for
a
mouse
all
eager
expectancy
to
hear
of
the
death
of
an
innocent
child
there
is
nothing
left
for
me
to
live
for
she
said
with
a
moan
no
one
wants
me
i
am
quite
superfluous
quite
it
does
seem
like
it
he
scoffed
why
have
you
summoned
me
to
come
to
you
speak
out
what
is
the
blow
you
are
holding
up
your
sleeve
blow
replied
his
sister
do
call
it
that
say
rather
benefit
benefit
for
us
all
i
have
kept
silent
from
one
year
end
to
another
and
have
staked
everything
upon
it
youth
happiness
peace
of
mind
but
now
i
must
speak
god
wills
it
so
god
directs
that
i
shall
tell
ulrich
all
so
that
his
house
may
be
purified
again
and
his
eyes
opened
to
what
sort
of
woman
his
wife
is
and
what
sort
of
man
his
friend
he
had
sprung
to
his
feet
and
his
hands
groped
towards
her
for
an
instant
his
insensate
fury
blinded
him
put
an
end
to
her
so
that
she
can
do
no
more
mischief
something
said
within
him
kill
her
rather
than
let
her
betray
you
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
walls
he
saw
a
bouquet
of
dusty
pampas
grass
in
a
blue
china
jar
on
a
bracket
a
good
shepherd
smiling
sweetly
down
on
the
lamb
in
his
arms
and
other
religious
lithograph
prints
slowly
he
collected
himself
when
do
you
propose
to
carry
out
your
intentions
he
inquired
hoarsely
so
soon
as
it
is
necessary
she
answered
when
will
it
be
necessary
he
eagerly
questioned
her
again
ulrich
is
away
from
königsberg
he
will
be
going
to
berlin
he
ca
be
back
before
march
so
till
then
you
will
have
to
be
patient
i
can
urge
him
to
come
home
she
replied
in
a
low
tone
with
a
tearful
smile
that
you
shall
not
do
he
cried
seizing
hold
of
her
roughly
the
room
spun
round
again
he
saw
nothing
but
the
vapour
of
his
fury
and
through
it
a
pair
of
widely
opened
eyes
staring
up
at
him
in
agonised
terror
he
felt
a
lean
throat
yielding
to
the
pressure
of
his
fingers
at
that
moment
his
sister
was
nothing
more
to
him
than
an
insect
a
moth
shying
at
the
light
that
could
be
crushed
to
powder
in
his
grasp
you
will
hold
your
tongue
he
hissed
or
i
throttle
you
he
tried
to
pull
her
up
but
with
a
sharp
hollow
bang
her
head
struck
against
the
corner
of
the
sofa
an
expression
of
acute
pain
passed
over
her
face
and
she
sank
in
a
kneeling
attitude
on
to
the
floor
then
he
half
regained
his
senses
he
let
go
of
her
throat
and
propped
her
head
against
the
cushion
and
then
he
tore
about
the
room
his
eyes
searching
in
desperation
every
corner
as
if
there
must
be
some
solution
concealed
there
as
to
how
he
was
to
save
himself
and
ulrich
the
crucifix
floated
weirdly
white
in
the
gathering
shadows
he
saw
the
good
shepherd
smile
and
the
dusty
grasses
seemed
to
tremble
how
can
i
save
myself
how
can
i
save
myself
he
cried
inwardly
and
he
felt
as
if
the
hatchet
which
the
shadow
of
evil
had
held
over
his
head
for
so
many
months
was
about
to
fall
but
at
the
sight
of
his
sister
lying
motionless
on
the
ground
with
her
head
resting
against
the
sofa
he
began
to
feel
ashamed
get
up
johanna
he
begged
it
is
true
that
i
would
like
to
kill
you
but
i
do
want
to
you
he
held
out
a
hand
to
help
her
rise
she
rejected
his
offer
and
with
difficulty
seated
herself
again
in
her
former
position
poor
leo
she
said
and
there
was
a
note
of
compassion
in
her
tired
voice
yes
indeed
poor
leo
poor
leo
he
exclaimed
planting
himself
before
her
in
his
consternation
you
can
pity
me
but
you
wo
hesitate
nevertheless
to
ruin
me
you
are
ruined
already
she
muttered
and
if
i
am
whose
fault
is
it
but
yours
and
that
cur
of
a
priest
i
be
even
with
him
too
you
want
to
speak
now
when
neither
god
nor
devil
can
do
anything
but
why
did
you
not
speak
out
at
the
time
that
ulrich
was
going
to
take
the
insane
step
of
marrying
you
were
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
might
have
prevented
the
blunder
why
did
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
then
eh
she
glanced
at
him
from
under
her
lids
in
furtive
distress
then
a
shudder
swept
the
angular
shoulders
on
which
her
dress
hung
in
folds
i
have
repented
oh
how
i
have
repented
everything
everything
she
murmured
repented
or
no
that
is
not
the
question
when
i
asked
you
in
the
summer
it
was
the
same
you
answered
by
evasion
i
say
that
if
you
have
a
clear
conscience
you
would
have
answered
me
then
and
would
answer
me
now
oh
do
torment
me
she
implored
in
growing
anxiety
and
leant
far
back
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
and
on
leo
repeating
his
demand
even
more
emphatically
she
burst
into
hysterical
weeping
motionless
she
sat
there
with
the
tears
streaming
in
rivulets
over
her
hollow
cheeks
he
had
never
seen
her
look
so
yielding
and
so
defenceless
and
in
the
midst
of
his
wrath
and
misery
a
gleam
of
chivalrous
pity
stirred
within
him
and
he
began
involuntarily
to
speak
to
her
in
gentler
tones
listen
johanna
i
came
here
hating
you
very
sorely
god
knows
a
little
more
and
i
might
have
but
you
are
not
what
you
were
for
all
your
threats
you
and
i
are
both
poor
bruised
and
broken
creatures
so
we
may
as
well
be
frank
with
each
other
come
tell
me
what
i
wish
to
know
before
it
is
too
late
her
tears
were
quenched
and
she
looked
at
him
in
utter
mystification
at
the
unexpected
softness
in
his
manner
so
accustomed
was
she
to
regard
him
in
the
light
of
some
wild
beast
that
she
could
hardly
grasp
that
he
meant
to
be
kind
gradually
her
eyes
recovered
their
fixed
and
glassy
expression
and
she
nodded
her
bead
mysteriously
towards
the
crucifix
in
the
corner
look
at
him
she
said
near
quite
near
at
whom
the
saviour
he
approached
the
and
gazed
into
the
white
face
of
the
crucified
so
calm
in
its
supreme
repose
as
if
weary
of
all
earthly
contentions
and
excitement
of
the
emotions
do
you
see
the
resemblance
asked
his
sister
with
an
almost
prudish
smile
no
to
whom
oh
leo
ca
you
see
she
replied
with
a
melancholy
little
attempt
at
playfulness
any
child
could
tell
you
whom
it
is
like
it
is
ulrich
exactly
like
ulrich
ah
really
exclaimed
leo
and
as
he
saw
the
look
of
possession
in
her
face
the
martyrdom
of
a
lifetime
was
revealed
to
him
in
a
flash
hannah
he
said
why
if
you
loved
him
so
much
did
you
take
up
with
that
villain
prachwitz
she
started
love
she
stammered
who
spoke
of
love
how
can
i
love
any
one
what
is
the
use
of
dissimulating
have
you
as
good
as
confessed
he
answered
whereupon
she
threw
herself
back
on
the
and
began
to
weep
again
silently
as
if
she
feared
the
intense
sorrow
of
her
soul
being
brought
to
light
she
tried
to
speak
but
could
only
articulate
a
confused
murmur
it
was
not
only
that
she
had
suffered
but
worst
of
all
she
was
ashamed
of
her
suffering
and
then
at
last
she
found
words
sufficiently
humble
in
which
to
begin
her
tale
it
would
sound
ridiculous
to
say
so
leo
and
you
may
scoff
at
me
as
much
as
you
like
but
you
are
right
i
love
him
and
i
have
always
loved
him
that
has
been
my
fate
and
god
meant
me
for
him
and
me
alone
for
i
understood
his
character
as
no
one
else
in
the
world
could
do
not
even
you
leo
with
all
your
great
friendship
if
i
had
become
his
wife
i
would
have
kissed
his
feet
and
hands
i
would
have
watched
over
his
poor
weakly
body
with
the
tenderest
care
which
now
languishes
because
no
one
troubles
about
it
but
she
came
i
wo
abuse
her
she
has
had
her
punishment
and
for
her
sake
he
forgot
me
he
ran
after
her
in
the
same
way
as
you
did
and
out
of
defiance
i
took
the
first
man
who
asked
me
when
i
came
back
here
as
a
widow
i
wondered
if
he
would
care
for
me
then
but
she
had
become
a
widow
too
thanks
to
you
and
i
was
embittered
and
wretched
and
dare
hope
for
happiness
any
more
she
on
the
contrary
had
added
attractiveness
and
fascinations
in
her
mourning
and
seemed
to
say
take
me
and
comfort
me
here
i
am
i
saw
how
he
was
drawn
to
her
more
and
more
on
the
pretext
of
compassionating
her
loneliness
and
i
looked
on
paralysed
with
agony
that
i
might
lose
him
a
second
time
but
instead
of
making
a
fight
for
him
i
kept
out
of
his
way
and
so
i
lost
him
lost
him
she
stopped
smiling
faintly
before
her
he
writhed
in
his
anger
against
the
fate
which
seemed
to
be
crushing
them
both
beneath
its
relentless
heel
and
felt
as
if
he
must
resist
it
with
his
last
strength
his
sister
went
on
then
came
the
day
when
i
learnt
your
secret
and
had
her
in
my
power
but
so
ungovernable
had
my
hate
and
jealousy
become
that
i
said
to
myself
if
he
thought
so
lowly
of
me
that
he
could
prefer
that
degraded
creature
i
would
let
him
marry
her
and
rue
the
day
as
you
and
i
should
rue
it
there
now
you
know
all
i
have
confessed
the
horrible
sin
i
committed
which
i
repent
bitterly
to
this
hour
and
shall
repent
so
long
as
my
poor
head
holds
out
but
it
is
oh
so
tired
my
head
and
my
knees
are
tired
too
it
ca
last
much
longer
dear
leo
she
laid
her
open
palms
upon
her
temples
and
sank
back
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
what
plans
have
you
for
the
future
johanna
he
asked
i
none
i
shall
go
into
a
lunatic
asylum
hannah
he
cried
yes
do
you
see
that
i
am
going
mad
she
asked
if
you
only
knew
the
visions
and
hallucinations
i
have
i
doubt
whether
you
would
let
me
go
about
without
restraint
i
have
seen
fiery
swords
and
the
burning
of
jerusalem
and
i
have
seen
the
great
moloch
when
threw
him
little
paul
as
a
sacrifice
uriah
wife
have
i
seen
in
shape
and
every
night
do
you
know
her
eyes
grew
bigger
as
she
poured
out
on
him
the
horror
of
her
sleepless
nights
every
night
the
saviour
comes
to
me
and
i
may
sit
at
his
feet
and
put
my
fingers
in
his
wounds
and
then
the
whole
room
is
full
of
his
radiance
and
hundreds
and
thousands
of
angels
flap
their
red
and
blue
wings
like
birds
of
paradise
that
is
a
marvellous
sight
i
can
assure
you
but
if
i
go
on
telling
you
more
two
strange
men
will
come
and
lay
hold
of
me
and
drag
me
to
a
madhouse
but
you
wo
let
them
do
it
dear
leo
will
you
she
sat
upright
and
stroked
his
arm
beseechingly
with
her
outstretched
hand
he
almost
forgot
his
own
position
in
pity
for
this
poor
wretched
existence
it
was
true
that
just
for
a
moment
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
that
if
he
had
her
put
under
restraint
he
would
be
saved
but
the
next
he
flung
the
idea
from
him
in
disgust
no
he
too
was
sick
and
tired
of
life
poor
woman
he
said
coming
nearer
to
her
poor
woman
and
he
laid
his
right
hand
gently
on
her
puritanically
smooth
head
she
looked
up
at
him
with
the
glance
of
a
whipped
hound
sighed
deeply
and
made
an
effort
to
lean
her
head
against
him
seeing
the
movement
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
put
his
arm
round
her
neck
they
sat
thus
for
a
long
time
clasping
each
other
closely
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
now
when
he
realised
how
much
the
woman
in
his
arms
was
his
deadly
enemy
every
vestige
of
his
hatred
for
her
ebbed
from
his
heart
was
she
not
made
of
the
same
clay
as
himself
she
half
a
lunatic
he
half
a
criminal
and
both
the
victims
of
a
tragic
fate
the
sellenthin
blood
which
had
boiled
so
hotly
in
their
veins
had
driven
them
along
different
paths
to
the
same
end
he
took
johanna
head
caressingly
between
his
hands
and
they
gazed
at
one
another
as
if
they
could
never
look
away
brother
and
sister
had
found
each
other
again
in
this
encounter
of
savage
fury
and
in
the
depths
of
profoundest
misery
at
last
he
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
rose
to
go
and
you
still
feel
that
you
must
tell
him
he
asked
it
is
your
firm
resolve
her
features
became
strained
and
her
eyes
again
started
and
burned
feverishly
do
ask
me
she
said
in
a
tone
of
tearful
obstinacy
it
is
decree
god
himself
has
demanded
it
of
me
can
i
disobey
god
and
it
must
be
soon
or
my
statement
may
not
be
credited
as
rational
well
then
god
will
be
done
he
said
taking
up
his
cap
hannah
leo
outside
he
began
to
whistle
his
favourite
paloma
air
he
felt
that
he
had
received
his
xxxvi
die
old
boy
die
die
a
voice
seemed
to
call
to
him
as
he
walked
along
and
his
spectral
giant
with
the
hatchet
nodded
assent
as
much
as
to
say
so
far
so
good
there
was
only
one
alternative
and
that
was
flight
in
hours
he
might
be
at
hamburg
thence
take
ship
over
the
ocean
never
to
return
there
was
a
sum
of
three
thousand
marks
to
draw
upon
the
rest
he
must
trust
the
lord
to
provide
or
more
strictly
speaking
ulrich
who
would
come
and
go
through
the
accounts
appease
the
creditors
call
in
interest
and
work
heaven
and
earth
to
save
the
reputation
of
the
disgraced
fugitive
ulrich
again
ulrich
and
no
one
else
the
reflection
was
so
intolerable
that
it
robbed
him
of
the
power
of
making
any
decision
a
written
confession
was
out
of
the
question
for
what
would
become
of
felicitas
exposed
and
betrayed
left
behind
in
ulrich
house
how
could
he
leave
her
in
the
lurch
she
who
clung
to
him
with
the
deadly
terror
of
a
guilty
woman
besides
he
was
full
of
longing
for
her
there
was
not
a
fibre
of
his
being
that
did
not
crave
to
possess
her
he
was
incapable
of
picturing
an
existence
without
this
horrible
agonising
desire
which
must
remain
for
all
eternity
unfulfilled
the
next
afternoon
he
set
out
for
uhlenfelde
he
was
drawn
there
by
the
effects
of
a
sleepless
night
a
wretched
day
of
dull
despair
and
not
least
by
a
malicious
curiosity
to
know
how
she
would
take
the
threatened
blow
if
she
set
him
free
he
would
start
the
same
evening
for
the
new
world
a
groom
informed
him
that
the
baroness
had
gone
forth
alone
on
foot
more
than
an
hour
ago
where
had
she
gone
the
man
could
not
say
yesterday
and
the
day
before
she
had
done
the
same
and
not
returned
home
till
long
after
dark
his
first
emotion
was
one
of
unworthy
miserable
jealousy
but
he
shook
it
off
to
münsterberg
was
his
command
to
the
coachman
as
he
got
into
the
sleigh
it
drove
out
of
the
courtyard
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
surrounded
by
the
fields
it
was
just
at
this
hour
yesterday
that
he
had
gone
to
see
johanna
the
sky
hung
heavily
over
the
landscape
like
a
canopy
another
fall
of
snow
was
coming
but
the
clouds
were
not
yet
low
enough
to
open
evening
shadows
were
beginning
to
colour
the
vast
expanse
of
monotone
whiteness
and
a
soft
wind
stirred
the
bare
brambles
that
flanked
the
ditches
and
it
made
the
remains
of
their
dried
withered
berries
shiver
as
if
they
felt
the
cold
through
the
silence
rang
out
in
stately
measure
the
music
of
the
moving
sleigh
no
other
sound
broke
the
stillness
from
the
which
skirted
the
road
for
some
distance
a
covey
of
crows
had
slowly
risen
and
now
hung
noiselessly
floating
in
the
clouds
the
pointed
poplars
by
the
roadside
seemed
every
second
to
grow
more
black
and
massive
here
he
hoped
to
meet
her
and
he
was
not
disappointed
he
had
scarcely
turned
into
the
wide
when
he
saw
a
dark
figure
in
flowing
draperies
of
crape
walking
towards
münsterberg
he
quickly
overtook
her
she
turned
round
the
wind
had
brought
colour
to
her
cheeks
and
beneath
the
brim
of
her
mourning
hat
which
cut
a
dark
tricom
on
the
fairness
of
her
forehead
her
face
looked
girlishly
fresh
and
sweet
the
tired
eyes
alone
showed
that
she
had
suffered
they
shone
when
she
saw
him
and
she
held
out
her
hands
as
of
old
charmed
and
radiant
his
soul
responded
to
her
in
jubilation
he
sprang
out
of
the
sleigh
and
bidding
the
man
walk
the
horses
slowly
up
and
down
he
offered
her
his
arm
what
are
you
doing
here
felicitas
he
asked
i
have
been
on
the
prowl
for
you
she
whispered
are
you
angry
with
me
for
doing
it
why
should
i
be
angry
he
answered
i
have
just
been
to
see
you
at
last
she
sighed
and
leaned
closely
against
him
my
whole
life
is
nothing
but
one
long
waiting
for
you
leo
i
am
sick
with
longing
for
you
and
i
for
you
he
muttered
her
arm
trembled
violently
in
his
they
were
both
silent
for
a
moment
for
they
now
knew
what
they
had
wanted
to
know
bars
of
rosy
twilight
from
the
west
fell
on
the
snowy
plain
the
as
they
walked
towards
it
deepened
in
colour
from
brown
to
violet
and
the
crows
were
on
the
ground
again
sitting
in
black
clumps
amidst
the
scanty
undergrowth
their
beaks
uplifted
to
the
sky
now
and
then
there
sounded
from
the
road
the
sharp
sudden
jingle
of
a
bell
when
the
waiting
horses
stamped
a
hoof
or
moved
a
head
leo
heart
beat
he
felt
that
in
the
next
few
minutes
their
fate
must
be
decided
listen
felicitas
he
began
things
are
in
a
bad
way
with
us
what
has
happened
she
stammered
standing
still
full
of
dismay
in
the
sleigh
ruts
nothing
has
happened
yet
but
we
must
part
before
something
does
she
began
to
lament
i
knew
you
would
desert
me
i
felt
sure
of
it
but
i
wo
let
you
i
will
stay
with
you
i
ca
live
without
you
and
she
clung
passionately
to
his
arm
as
if
she
feared
he
might
that
minute
be
snatched
from
her
as
he
saw
her
face
blanch
and
her
eyes
raised
to
his
in
beseeching
fear
he
abandoned
all
thoughts
of
flight
he
felt
that
responsibility
for
this
trembling
was
yet
another
burden
added
to
his
already
sorely
weighted
soul
she
buried
both
hands
in
his
fur
and
held
him
fast
as
if
she
would
never
let
him
go
had
he
walked
on
he
would
have
had
to
drag
her
after
him
along
the
ground
then
all
i
can
do
is
to
put
a
bullet
through
my
brain
he
murmured
looking
beyond
her
she
gave
a
sharp
cry
have
mercy
on
me
she
implored
do
frighten
me
so
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
frighten
me
so
you
have
done
nothing
felicitas
he
answered
but
johanna
is
going
to
speak
there
was
silence
the
gentle
breeze
stole
over
the
snow
plains
and
whispered
in
the
hedgerows
the
crows
had
changed
their
squatting
attitude
and
were
circling
above
the
pair
with
lazily
flapping
wings
while
the
more
distant
ones
were
preparing
to
fly
felicitas
slowly
loosened
her
grasp
and
passed
her
hand
three
times
dreamily
over
her
forehead
she
glanced
searchingly
to
right
and
left
as
though
she
suspected
the
avenger
might
be
crouching
in
the
ditch
come
into
the
wood
she
said
no
one
will
see
us
there
and
without
waiting
for
his
consent
she
plunged
sideways
over
the
deep
snow
furrowed
here
and
there
by
the
footprints
of
wild
creatures
she
did
not
dare
to
stop
till
she
had
reached
the
protection
of
the
thin
branches
of
the
underwood
he
followed
her
with
deliberate
steps
and
he
too
felt
relieved
when
the
shrubs
hid
them
from
view
she
not
speak
exclaimed
felicitas
clasping
her
hands
i
pray
you
dearest
to
prevent
it
you
must
put
a
seal
on
her
lips
promise
that
you
will
he
laughed
gloomily
there
is
one
means
by
which
i
might
prevent
her
he
said
and
if
she
insists
i
could
resort
to
it
but
again
he
felt
disgust
at
the
idea
which
he
had
before
entertained
for
a
moment
and
then
rejected
as
monstrous
leave
me
alone
he
cried
out
to
her
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
it
all
i
must
end
it
only
do
run
away
she
whimpered
clinging
to
him
once
more
do
run
away
anything
rather
than
that
i
agree
with
you
he
replied
there
is
one
other
course
for
me
to
take
better
than
flight
he
shuddered
and
was
silent
you
mean
die
she
asked
half
inquisitive
half
terrified
pressing
herself
against
him
like
a
child
in
the
dark
he
nodded
you
must
see
there
is
no
third
course
yes
i
see
then
die
she
whispered
throwing
back
her
head
with
an
inviting
smile
much
better
die
he
grew
hot
you
seem
to
be
in
a
tremendous
hurry
to
get
rid
of
me
he
said
with
half
fretful
jocularity
to
get
rid
of
you
she
asked
offended
do
you
think
i
would
let
you
die
without
me
felicitas
he
exclaimed
seizing
both
her
hands
could
there
be
a
more
blissful
fate
for
me
beloved
she
went
on
in
a
whisper
than
to
die
in
your
arms
he
held
her
close
to
him
a
feeling
of
intoxication
which
he
interpreted
as
a
longing
for
death
took
shuddering
possession
of
his
soul
it
was
succeeded
by
a
damping
mistrust
mistrust
of
himself
and
much
more
of
her
are
you
serious
he
asked
for
i
tell
you
plainly
this
time
it
will
be
no
joke
we
shall
not
drink
toothache
drops
how
can
you
she
pouted
and
then
with
a
smile
of
rapture
she
added
i
will
be
yours
yours
if
not
in
life
at
least
in
death
reflect
on
it
well
felicitas
he
warned
her
again
remember
that
it
is
not
only
the
bald
fact
that
we
die
it
may
cost
us
no
great
pain
to
leave
this
scurvy
world
but
we
shall
forfeit
in
doing
it
all
that
man
holds
precious
we
shall
be
cast
like
a
dog
into
a
nameless
grave
they
will
spit
at
our
memory
what
will
that
matter
to
us
she
asked
smiling
we
shall
know
nothing
about
it
then
you
wish
to
die
yes
in
your
arms
i
wish
to
die
she
breathed
and
laid
her
head
back
with
eyes
blissfully
closed
so
that
the
evening
light
illuminated
the
fairness
of
her
face
that
how
she
will
look
thought
he
she
lifted
her
lids
yes
yes
but
i
am
still
alive
she
said
guessing
his
thoughts
then
with
half
playful
melancholy
she
sought
his
mouth
thirstingly
with
her
lips
and
they
proceeded
to
discuss
how
things
should
be
arranged
the
next
day
was
to
be
consecrated
to
their
last
business
affairs
at
the
hour
of
midnight
they
were
to
meet
on
the
river
bank
to
select
the
place
where
the
light
of
another
day
should
dawn
on
them
united
in
death
felicitas
shivered
you
are
already
drawing
back
he
asked
seized
by
fierce
suspicion
she
hid
her
head
on
his
breast
and
before
she
whispered
up
to
him
his
glance
wandered
into
the
distance
he
seemed
to
see
the
lamp
at
fichtkampen
in
whose
rays
he
had
lost
for
ever
his
pureness
of
heart
shining
at
him
alluringly
again
what
do
you
mean
by
he
stammered
i
am
a
weak
woman
at
the
very
last
moment
i
might
lose
my
nerve
and
not
be
able
to
go
down
to
the
water
alone
knowing
that
death
would
be
waiting
for
me
there
so
please
make
it
easier
by
coming
up
to
fetch
me
then
we
could
start
together
on
our
last
walk
for
a
moment
a
wild
hope
leapt
up
within
him
only
to
be
quickly
smothered
he
looked
down
on
her
silently
and
breathed
in
the
fragrance
of
her
body
that
white
delicately
moulded
body
in
which
his
young
senses
had
once
found
rest
and
riches
if
you
are
afraid
he
said
i
will
come
she
caught
at
the
promise
and
eagerly
and
anxiously
began
to
explain
how
his
visit
was
to
be
managed
minna
should
go
down
to
the
stream
and
wait
for
him
by
the
sandbank
and
when
he
came
unlock
the
park
gate
and
lead
him
up
to
her
room
by
the
new
turret
staircase
he
listened
to
her
instructions
half
in
a
dream
he
was
shaken
body
and
soul
more
strongly
than
before
by
that
mysterious
sense
of
intoxication
which
was
nothing
could
be
nothing
else
but
the
omnipotent
desire
for
death
and
then
they
separated
she
took
the
path
to
uhlenfelde
and
he
went
back
to
the
sleigh
when
he
reached
the
road
he
stopped
leaned
against
a
poplar
and
looked
after
her
her
figure
was
a
mere
black
strip
in
the
midst
of
the
vast
white
duskiness
of
the
snow
fields
it
grew
smaller
and
rounder
and
finally
shrank
to
a
vanishing
point
all
at
once
a
wave
of
cruel
devouring
scorn
swept
over
him
scorn
of
himself
scorn
of
her
scorn
of
the
whole
world
this
was
the
end
this
was
the
end
he
laughed
aloud
so
fierce
and
mirthless
a
laugh
that
johann
who
was
sitting
on
his
box
twenty
paces
away
started
and
looked
round
the
horses
moved
forward
the
bells
rippled
through
the
air
what
now
leo
asked
himself
and
stared
absently
in
the
old
coachman
face
he
had
intended
to
drive
to
münsterberg
what
did
he
want
in
münsterberg
ah
to
be
sure
he
had
been
going
to
see
the
old
jew
jacobi
in
order
to
raise
cash
for
his
voyage
to
america
but
that
would
not
be
necessary
now
nevertheless
he
must
kill
time
somehow
till
the
fatal
hour
drew
near
to
münsterberg
then
sleighing
was
good
sport
he
said
to
himself
as
he
flew
through
the
twilight
and
the
wind
met
his
face
he
tried
to
recollect
what
other
business
he
had
in
münsterberg
the
wanted
repairing
hang
the
then
there
were
debts
to
pay
paltry
little
debts
the
big
ones
would
have
to
remain
unsettled
he
owed
a
clerk
called
danziger
fifteen
marks
a
betting
loss
fritz
the
head
waiter
at
the
prussian
crown
had
not
been
paid
for
the
last
drinking
bout
and
then
he
remembered
that
the
ida
had
drunk
his
health
in
three
brandy
bitters
and
was
so
far
the
loser
by
the
transaction
fair
ida
is
a
bad
sort
he
thought
she
must
suffer
through
my
death
on
the
road
to
the
right
he
passed
the
seat
of
the
neuhaus
family
who
their
tenants
to
stave
off
bankruptcy
a
little
further
on
was
althof
where
fat
hans
sembritzky
was
gradually
developing
into
the
worst
of
husbands
through
having
too
easy
a
time
all
was
vain
and
rotten
life
was
a
hollow
mockery
and
he
whistled
contemptuously
as
he
adopted
the
embittered
attitude
of
the
abandoned
outcast
towards
the
world
he
was
leaving
aye
to
quit
it
was
the
only
wisdom
for
everything
else
was
folly
even
ulrich
hush
he
must
not
think
of
ulrich
the
blow
would
kill
him
that
was
certain
not
the
strongest
could
survive
such
a
betrayal
all
he
could
do
to
soften
it
would
be
to
leave
behind
a
few
hasty
lines
alluding
to
the
old
sin
but
not
to
the
renewal
of
the
old
love
ah
why
had
ulrich
committed
the
insane
folly
of
marrying
a
woman
who
belonged
by
nature
to
a
scamp
like
himself
no
he
must
not
could
not
think
of
ulrich
how
charming
she
had
looked
in
her
mourning
weeds
like
a
nun
in
a
novel
with
what
tactful
care
she
had
avoided
mentioning
ulrich
name
as
if
no
such
person
as
ulrich
existed
and
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
either
to
waste
a
word
or
a
tear
on
the
poor
little
fellow
in
his
distant
grave
he
was
dead
and
forgotten
before
the
grass
had
grown
over
him
dead
and
forgotten
as
he
leo
sellenthin
would
soon
be
dead
and
forgotten
well
the
only
thing
that
mattered
now
was
that
ida
should
be
paid
for
the
absinth
first
he
went
to
pay
his
debts
at
the
prussian
crown
and
found
two
or
three
of
his
recent
associates
there
fat
hans
of
course
among
them
they
were
busily
engaged
playing
games
of
dice
of
their
own
invention
over
their
glasses
of
flat
beer
they
played
the
naked
sparrow
and
the
highest
at
points
leo
was
greeted
with
a
roar
of
welcome
and
asked
to
join
he
answered
with
sudden
reckless
indiscretion
my
boys
i
am
going
to
shoot
myself
so
i
do
know
whether
i
ought
they
considered
the
question
seriously
then
the
majority
agreed
that
it
would
be
permissible
for
him
to
play
if
the
games
chosen
bore
on
the
gravity
of
the
situation
so
they
forthwith
proposed
the
wet
funeral
the
corpse
in
the
forest
and
because
they
could
not
think
of
anything
else
particularly
sad
the
hole
in
the
ceiling
leo
made
his
throws
and
cracked
his
jokes
but
all
the
time
a
voice
cried
triumphantly
in
his
ear
die
old
boy
die
die
when
he
had
lost
the
game
and
paid
up
he
explained
that
he
had
business
to
settle
with
the
fair
ida
and
as
it
was
dark
the
others
offered
to
accompany
him
leo
took
the
lead
he
pushed
open
the
of
engelmann
and
found
in
the
hot
little
room
reeking
with
smoke
a
table
full
of
toping
bailiffs
and
farmers
fair
ida
flew
to
him
and
hung
round
his
neck
but
he
shook
her
off
roughly
for
there
at
the
head
of
the
drinkers
he
beheld
the
candidate
kurt
brenckenberg
smug
and
smiling
as
ever
and
a
cruel
satisfaction
thrilled
through
him
the
fellow
is
now
in
my
clutches
he
said
to
himself
and
so
i
shall
not
go
to
another
world
without
having
avenged
the
insult
my
family
has
suffered
from
this
impudent
cur
the
halewitz
bailiffs
at
the
entrance
of
the
had
risen
respectfully
to
give
up
their
seats
but
the
candidate
though
visibly
paler
pretended
not
to
have
noticed
or
seen
any
one
come
in
leo
went
up
to
him
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
herr
kurt
brenckenberg
you
know
where
to
find
me
herr
leo
von
sellenthin
replied
the
candidate
without
stirring
from
his
place
thank
god
i
have
found
you
leo
replied
the
boy
struggled
to
put
on
his
most
arrogant
air
excuse
me
herr
von
sellenthin
he
said
toying
nervously
with
the
badge
in
his
buttonhole
i
must
remind
you
that
i
am
and
know
what
is
etiquette
in
these
matters
once
before
you
have
treated
me
in
this
extraordinary
fashion
please
leave
me
alone
i
have
no
time
to
give
you
at
present
something
like
pity
awoke
in
leo
as
he
smiled
down
on
this
wretched
little
upstart
bristling
with
pugnacity
at
another
time
he
might
have
challenged
him
to
face
his
pistol
and
might
have
shot
him
down
but
now
that
his
own
had
sounded
such
a
course
seemed
hardly
worth
while
and
to
belong
too
much
to
the
things
that
did
not
matter
to
the
petty
despicable
affairs
of
the
world
on
which
his
hold
was
loosening
nevertheless
he
determined
to
give
the
young
man
a
lesson
so
that
his
foolish
little
sister
should
be
safe
from
his
impertinent
attentions
for
the
future
get
up
he
roared
seizing
him
by
the
arm
and
putting
him
on
his
feet
the
candidate
raised
his
fist
to
strike
him
in
the
face
but
before
he
could
carry
out
his
intention
leo
left
hand
gripped
both
his
wrists
as
in
a
vice
the
ida
screamed
loudly
and
ran
out
the
bailiffs
drew
aside
perturbed
and
hans
sembritzky
initiated
the
rest
of
his
party
in
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
for
a
few
minutes
dead
silence
reigned
in
the
stuffy
crowded
room
which
was
insufficiently
lighted
by
one
smoking
lamp
the
candidate
in
his
frantic
efforts
to
free
his
hands
bounded
up
and
down
like
a
dancing
doll
you
young
blackguard
said
leo
instead
of
sitting
on
your
form
at
school
you
swagger
about
the
countryside
and
play
the
devil
if
your
old
father
wo
spank
you
i
must
he
looked
round
for
an
instrument
that
would
serve
his
purpose
and
saw
hanging
against
the
wall
a
stout
ruler
which
the
landlord
used
when
making
up
his
accounts
he
tore
it
from
its
nail
then
supporting
himself
in
a
posture
against
the
nearest
chair
he
stretched
the
youth
full
length
across
his
left
knee
and
while
with
his
right
he
controlled
the
candidate
desperately
kicking
feet
he
did
execution
on
his
tightened
trousers
with
a
vigour
that
would
have
astounded
the
normans
and
westphalians
had
they
been
spectators
of
the
scene
there
my
son
said
leo
when
he
had
done
now
you
have
got
what
you
deserved
go
home
and
give
your
father
my
compliments
with
a
face
white
as
chalk
and
starting
eyes
the
candidate
reeled
to
a
seat
leo
calmly
hung
up
the
ruler
again
on
its
nail
and
made
a
deep
bow
to
the
onlookers
who
stood
round
in
a
breathless
and
amazed
circle
then
giving
hans
sembritzky
his
hand
he
strode
to
the
door
laughing
heartily
not
till
he
was
seated
in
the
sleigh
did
he
remember
that
he
had
not
paid
fair
ida
for
her
three
absinths
xxxvii
supper
was
going
on
when
leo
reached
halewitz
he
entered
the
house
unobserved
the
corridor
was
in
darkness
but
christian
who
had
just
gone
to
the
kitchen
with
a
pile
of
plates
had
left
the
door
ajar
and
a
thin
stream
of
light
that
came
through
it
penetrated
the
shadows
but
no
laughter
no
cheerful
talk
fell
on
his
ear
meals
at
halewitz
were
now
sad
affairs
shall
i
go
in
and
sit
down
with
them
he
asked
himself
then
he
felt
that
he
could
not
trust
himself
that
his
farewell
emotions
might
be
too
much
for
him
he
would
take
a
last
peep
at
them
and
then
go
quietly
to
his
rooms
on
tiptoe
he
drew
nearer
there
the
three
sat
at
table
under
the
golden
radiance
of
the
hanging
lamp
grandmamma
on
the
left
ah
god
how
she
had
aged
he
thought
and
his
heart
smote
him
beside
her
elly
was
looking
fresh
and
innocent
with
the
lamplight
illumining
her
fair
hair
and
on
the
right
sat
hertha
she
was
the
same
but
different
the
dignified
repose
of
her
bearing
the
troubled
glance
of
her
eye
the
lines
of
pain
on
the
brown
oval
cheeks
the
firmly
closed
lips
were
all
new
to
him
he
felt
that
she
had
ripened
and
developed
under
the
same
sorrow
which
had
rotted
and
withered
him
how
blind
he
had
been
to
her
fine
qualities
only
the
nearness
of
death
opened
his
eyes
to
them
and
to
everything
that
surrounded
him
he
saw
every
detail
of
the
rooms
that
he
had
so
long
avoided
as
if
he
had
been
given
an
extra
sense
with
which
to
impress
things
on
his
mind
before
leaving
life
his
ear
listened
eagerly
for
each
word
that
fell
from
the
dear
ones
lips
his
hand
caressed
with
unconscious
affection
the
with
their
oak
carvings
christian
coming
back
ended
his
reverie
and
before
he
had
been
seen
he
retired
softly
to
his
room
he
wanted
to
work
to
go
through
the
books
and
put
things
straight
so
far
as
it
was
possible
he
did
not
wish
to
sneak
out
of
the
world
like
a
beggarly
bankrupt
he
lit
his
lamp
and
began
to
cast
up
figures
the
year
had
not
been
a
bad
one
old
arrears
had
been
patched
up
hopeful
prospects
peeped
out
everywhere
between
the
columns
amazing
success
had
attended
the
beetroot
culture
and
in
following
years
the
ground
would
be
even
more
richly
productive
in
that
line
he
was
on
the
point
of
drawing
up
a
new
scheme
of
planting
when
he
remembered
that
the
day
after
he
would
not
be
alive
he
shut
the
book
with
a
bang
and
jumped
up
how
farcical
it
all
was
how
insane
both
life
and
death
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
rang
the
bell
violently
for
he
was
hungry
since
the
morning
he
had
scarcely
touched
food
christian
appeared
on
the
threshold
and
reeled
back
in
delighted
astonishment
at
beholding
his
master
in
the
house
at
this
unaccustomed
hour
now
then
old
friend
said
leo
filled
with
a
strange
tenderness
wo
those
old
pins
of
yours
carry
you
any
longer
and
as
christian
in
his
confusion
stammer
forth
inarticulate
sentences
leo
put
a
piece
into
his
hand
you
have
had
to
keep
bad
hours
lately
on
my
account
but
in
future
old
man
you
shall
have
your
proper
rest
christian
wept
tears
of
joy
over
his
master
consideration
and
shuffled
away
to
superintend
his
supper
the
news
he
took
to
the
kitchen
soon
ascended
to
the
parlour
and
the
stir
it
caused
in
the
house
smacked
somewhat
of
the
prodigal
return
doors
were
cautiously
opened
and
shut
whispered
conversations
were
held
in
the
corridors
and
now
and
then
hesitating
hushed
footsteps
halted
outside
his
room
all
this
he
heard
and
ground
his
teeth
die
die
old
boy
cried
a
voice
in
his
ears
die
die
christian
brought
a
tray
groaning
with
good
things
in
the
selection
of
which
he
could
see
that
his
mother
had
had
a
hand
he
fell
to
greedily
there
was
the
favourite
dish
of
his
schoolboy
days
of
fried
potatoes
with
jugged
hare
and
baked
slices
of
ham
dear
old
girl
he
thought
this
is
her
way
of
saying
with
us
he
laughed
but
tears
came
into
his
eyes
christian
wanted
to
know
what
he
would
have
to
drink
do
ask
me
old
chap
he
said
but
bring
the
very
best
that
my
deceased
father
left
behind
bring
three
bottles
astonished
christian
begged
for
the
key
of
the
cellar
for
its
treasures
were
now
kept
zealously
locked
up
the
wine
came
the
wine
that
had
been
his
father
pride
and
joy
why
should
he
leave
the
glorious
stuff
to
be
drunk
by
strangers
and
in
long
draughts
he
emptied
the
first
bottle
but
for
him
the
wine
had
no
flavour
he
felt
his
cheeks
grow
hot
and
his
mood
become
more
sombre
he
would
have
liked
to
make
his
exit
from
the
world
with
gay
nonchalance
but
instead
the
old
agony
began
to
gnaw
at
his
vitals
again
like
an
ulcer
that
was
incurable
he
started
pacing
wildly
up
and
down
the
room
and
wrenched
open
the
windows
one
after
the
other
he
longed
for
a
companion
he
was
in
sore
need
of
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
the
touch
of
a
human
hand
and
this
desire
which
he
supposed
would
be
his
last
on
earth
was
strangely
enough
fulfilled
it
was
nearly
ten
when
the
front
door
bell
clanged
violently
through
the
house
leo
hand
went
out
involuntarily
towards
the
wall
where
his
weapons
hung
they
have
come
to
fetch
me
he
thought
with
a
sudden
horrid
fear
of
arrest
he
drew
himself
to
his
full
height
and
awaited
his
visitor
christian
announced
that
pastor
brenckenberg
had
called
and
urgently
requested
an
interview
hurrah
cried
leo
the
very
person
i
want
let
him
come
in
all
the
grim
resentment
he
had
so
long
cherished
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
for
this
old
man
rose
to
the
surface
he
felt
that
he
had
been
delivered
into
his
hand
at
an
auspicious
moment
in
this
hour
he
would
make
him
rue
it
in
his
company
he
would
celebrate
his
farewell
to
life
in
a
voice
of
thunder
he
welcomed
the
belated
guest
who
kicking
the
snow
off
his
boots
with
his
heels
entered
the
room
in
breathless
haste
he
was
attired
in
a
shabby
fur
coat
like
an
esquimaux
and
had
twisted
a
thick
brown
woollen
scarf
two
or
three
times
round
his
throat
his
fleshy
face
was
purple
either
from
the
winter
winds
or
from
excitement
sweat
ran
down
his
hanging
cheeks
and
in
his
fierce
bulldog
eyes
which
in
vain
endeavoured
to
look
round
him
with
serenity
there
was
an
expression
of
eager
impatience
well
old
fellow
leo
exclaimed
the
almighty
has
done
well
to
lead
you
here
see
this
is
something
extra
special
a
farewell
drink
and
turning
to
christian
he
gave
him
orders
to
bring
in
another
armful
of
bottles
and
ice
with
them
the
pastor
had
remained
standing
at
the
door
tugging
violently
at
the
woollen
scarf
which
in
the
heat
of
the
room
nearly
suffocated
him
take
it
off
take
it
off
old
man
said
leo
he
did
as
he
was
commanded
stroked
back
the
oiled
strands
of
hair
on
his
neck
and
with
his
mouth
open
breathed
heavily
like
an
animal
wanting
to
sneeze
i
am
glad
to
see
you
so
well
satisfied
with
yourself
my
son
he
said
at
last
just
as
if
you
had
performed
some
heroic
action
of
course
leo
answered
to
me
heroic
actions
come
naturally
and
he
poured
him
out
a
glass
your
health
old
man
the
pastor
stole
a
timid
glance
at
the
sparkling
wine
do
you
know
why
i
have
come
here
at
this
hour
when
most
people
are
in
their
beds
he
asked
sourly
leaning
against
the
door
to
your
health
did
you
hear
me
cried
leo
whereat
the
pastor
staggered
towards
the
table
and
raised
the
glass
with
two
trembling
hands
but
he
put
it
down
again
i
ca
he
groaned
and
protruded
his
lower
jaw
half
sobbing
with
disgust
what
shouted
leo
you
despise
my
best
wine
what
fad
is
this
nothing
nothing
muttered
the
old
clergyman
and
pushed
the
glass
nervously
away
from
him
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
in
my
present
condition
i
should
outrage
my
body
and
outrage
the
wine
if
i
drank
it
condition
jeered
leo
and
what
sort
of
condition
do
you
suppose
that
i
am
in
have
you
ever
seen
a
wild
boar
run
to
earth
in
a
swamp
quenching
its
thirst
with
foul
water
when
the
hounds
have
almost
begun
to
tear
it
to
pieces
well
that
is
the
condition
in
which
i
am
drinking
here
but
i
am
going
to
drink
another
for
all
that
to
your
health
old
man
the
pastor
regarded
him
with
a
disconcerted
expression
then
silently
raised
the
glass
emptied
it
and
gave
himself
a
shake
is
it
nice
laughed
leo
you
and
i
sitting
and
drinking
here
amiably
together
cheek
by
jowl
we
ought
to
be
happy
and
sing
that
good
old
song
and
sacred
brothers
is
the
hour
which
unites
us
here
again
and
he
sang
the
couplet
or
perhaps
you
would
prefer
some
more
obscene
chorus
i
am
ready
for
any
he
tossed
down
two
more
glasses
of
the
iced
wine
feeling
as
he
did
so
how
his
imagination
began
to
go
mad
all
sorts
of
pictures
shot
up
before
his
eyes
and
disappeared
again
directly
he
tried
to
retain
them
the
old
man
who
had
been
brooding
gloomily
with
his
chin
on
his
breast
and
a
fixed
glare
in
his
eyes
raised
himself
slowly
with
his
hands
grasping
the
edge
of
the
table
and
struggled
with
the
unpronounced
words
which
half
strangled
him
do
you
know
why
i
have
come
he
asked
a
second
time
i
think
that
i
may
safely
hazard
a
guess
laughed
leo
it
was
my
unpleasant
duty
this
evening
to
give
your
young
hopeful
a
drubbing
which
he
wo
forget
in
a
hurry
come
here
to
his
health
long
may
your
son
and
heir
flourish
look
here
fritzchen
said
the
pastor
this
is
mocking
and
jeering
at
a
poor
parent
whom
anxiety
has
driven
out
into
the
night
i
call
it
low
of
you
fritzchen
i
could
have
believed
you
capable
of
it
knowing
what
your
character
used
to
be
but
i
describe
to
you
the
state
of
things
at
home
and
then
perhaps
you
will
be
stirred
to
a
little
human
pity
we
were
sitting
at
supper
my
wife
and
the
children
and
i
when
the
boy
rushed
in
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
his
lips
running
with
blood
he
fell
on
the
ground
and
clutched
at
my
knees
sake
tell
me
what
has
happened
my
son
said
i
and
he
cried
out
father
kill
me
kill
me
i
am
disgraced
dishonoured
all
decent
men
will
kick
and
spurn
me
like
a
mangy
cur
in
future
then
i
dragged
him
into
my
study
and
said
me
all
lad
and
so
i
learnt
what
had
passed
fritzchen
why
have
you
disgraced
my
own
flesh
and
blood
how
have
i
sinned
against
you
that
you
should
have
done
this
thing
you
have
sinned
against
me
enough
old
man
replied
leo
but
of
that
more
hereafter
as
for
your
precious
son
he
has
behaved
himself
like
a
cad
to
my
sister
and
insulted
my
family
and
me
so
i
was
forced
to
punish
him
punishment
is
just
you
know
that
is
your
own
principle
why
did
you
challenge
him
asked
the
pastor
according
to
the
custom
of
our
country
leo
laughed
at
him
derisively
challenge
as
if
i
had
the
time
to
waste
bullets
on
every
silly
youth
living
on
his
father
bounty
whoever
does
earn
his
bread
does
deserve
that
a
man
should
take
the
trouble
to
load
a
pistol
on
his
account
a
cane
serves
the
purpose
best
or
a
ruler
if
it
comes
handy
the
pastor
nodded
his
head
in
dumb
distress
and
leo
continued
to
fix
a
hard
revengeful
gaze
upon
him
now
then
cheer
up
cheer
up
he
bantered
you
have
come
here
to
sit
with
a
dry
whistle
and
your
mouth
shut
fritzchen
began
the
old
man
again
you
may
be
right
in
everything
and
i
admit
that
the
boy
is
a
rascal
but
he
is
the
best
i
have
got
at
present
my
second
boy
wo
be
a
man
for
another
ten
years
and
you
whom
i
have
always
loved
must
needs
come
and
ruin
him
for
life
fritzchen
it
wo
do
it
wo
do
nonsense
pished
leo
no
fritzchen
he
has
generally
been
able
to
pull
himself
together
again
after
a
scrape
but
now
he
is
completely
done
for
he
must
slink
about
for
the
rest
of
his
days
like
a
criminal
and
when
he
appears
amongst
his
equals
they
will
give
him
the
cold
shoulder
because
of
the
stain
that
rests
on
him
you
see
fritzchen
that
i
am
an
old
myself
and
know
what
it
means
to
be
thrashed
without
the
chance
of
defending
yourself
if
it
had
been
a
burglar
or
an
escaped
lunatic
who
had
done
it
he
might
get
over
it
but
you
are
the
baron
von
sellenthin
whom
all
the
world
knows
and
if
you
decline
to
give
satisfaction
the
world
will
conclude
that
you
have
very
good
reasons
for
doing
so
and
be
on
your
side
leo
groaned
and
thought
of
the
shame
that
he
was
about
to
bring
the
next
night
on
his
own
good
name
and
memory
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
asked
am
i
to
go
and
humbly
beg
his
pardon
and
promise
not
to
do
it
again
no
fritzchen
but
when
he
sends
a
second
bearing
his
challenge
to
you
you
ought
to
accept
it
and
arrange
the
usual
formalities
and
then
the
rest
fritzchen
will
be
your
affair
look
out
cried
leo
in
a
threatening
tone
you
know
i
never
jest
my
bullet
never
misses
the
mark
at
which
i
choose
to
aim
i
have
sent
one
man
into
eternity
already
remember
that
then
the
pastor
slowly
rose
to
his
feet
and
with
a
solemn
movement
of
his
arms
he
said
i
am
an
old
man
and
i
have
not
got
much
to
look
forward
to
he
is
my
my
heart
delight
my
hope
but
i
would
a
thousand
times
rather
hand
him
over
to
you
to
do
with
him
what
you
did
with
that
other
than
that
he
should
continue
to
live
despised
and
disgraced
leo
was
shocked
for
a
moment
but
the
next
he
felt
a
wild
satisfaction
that
buoyed
him
up
here
was
an
old
man
coming
to
him
a
murderer
and
suicide
to
beg
him
take
his
son
life
and
he
asked
the
favour
over
two
foaming
glasses
of
wine
truly
they
were
a
couple
the
devil
himself
could
not
have
matched
them
better
your
health
old
he
would
have
shouted
again
but
the
words
stuck
in
his
throat
and
the
old
man
who
could
scarcely
stand
on
his
legs
dragged
his
corpulent
body
ponderously
round
the
table
and
laid
both
hands
on
leo
shoulders
speaking
down
into
his
ear
from
over
the
back
of
his
chair
he
said
think
my
son
for
how
many
years
your
training
was
in
my
hands
i
taught
you
to
fight
for
honour
and
right
till
the
last
drop
of
blood
you
were
a
wild
lad
and
tyranny
would
have
been
dearer
to
you
than
justice
but
my
rod
hung
over
you
and
you
were
obliged
to
obey
however
much
you
kicked
against
the
pricks
and
for
that
i
claim
your
gratitude
you
have
my
thanks
sneered
leo
and
if
you
want
a
testimonial
here
it
is
you
were
a
severe
taskmaster
no
fritzchen
that
i
was
not
for
i
was
fond
of
you
and
you
were
fond
of
me
do
you
remember
that
september
evening
when
we
went
out
into
the
meadows
and
climbed
on
to
a
haystack
and
lay
looking
up
at
the
clouds
nothing
happened
but
all
of
a
sudden
you
crept
close
to
me
and
laying
your
head
quietly
against
my
arm
began
to
sob
i
think
that
you
must
remember
it
for
on
that
evening
i
became
your
friend
then
there
was
the
day
we
went
into
the
town
to
see
tell
in
the
night
you
came
to
me
and
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
took
your
solemn
oath
that
you
too
would
die
for
your
fatherland
for
liberty
oh
my
god
groaned
leo
and
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
you
see
fritzchen
went
on
the
old
man
i
may
have
been
at
that
time
a
and
as
fond
of
a
glass
as
i
am
but
your
young
soul
i
guided
aright
you
must
allow
and
have
you
forgotten
how
i
encouraged
your
friendship
with
ulrich
how
my
only
wish
was
to
play
third
in
the
covenant
when
johanna
could
not
officiate
and
then
again
my
son
there
was
the
time
when
your
heart
first
beat
in
response
to
another
have
you
forgotten
that
too
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
forester
at
knutzendorf
who
used
to
bring
the
weekly
paper
every
saturday
to
the
castle
she
was
eleven
and
you
were
thirteen
i
believe
she
did
know
that
two
and
two
make
four
but
she
grew
into
a
devilish
clever
girl
later
but
never
mind
that
do
you
remember
confiding
in
me
the
secret
that
you
had
run
after
her
in
the
road
and
kissed
her
and
that
she
had
let
herself
be
kissed
quite
calmly
and
it
made
you
so
happy
fritzchen
so
confoundedly
happy
with
an
exclamation
of
anguish
leo
raised
his
elbows
and
shook
off
the
old
man
heavy
touch
that
had
been
the
beginning
of
it
his
introduction
to
love
and
now
it
had
come
to
an
end
he
sprang
to
his
feet
what
do
you
want
with
me
man
he
cried
that
you
torture
me
thus
the
pastor
bowed
his
massive
head
almost
humbly
i
only
want
to
remind
you
that
you
owe
me
a
debt
of
gratitude
he
said
and
i
wish
you
to
make
it
good
to
my
son
here
i
stand
may
god
pardon
me
here
i
stand
and
entreat
you
to
fight
with
him
and
if
you
ca
help
yourself
shoot
him
dead
there
was
a
silence
the
old
clock
in
the
corner
chimed
eleven
this
time
thought
leo
i
shall
be
walking
to
my
death
and
with
this
reflection
he
thrust
from
him
the
old
memories
which
had
begun
to
weave
a
coil
of
softening
sentiment
about
his
soul
he
would
have
liked
to
pour
out
the
whole
gamut
of
emotions
surging
within
him
in
curses
on
the
head
of
this
old
man
who
had
come
to
fight
a
desperate
battle
on
behalf
of
his
despicable
little
son
honour
he
placed
himself
in
front
of
him
with
his
legs
apart
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
laughed
look
at
me
he
shouted
i
looking
at
you
replied
the
pastor
how
jolly
mild
you
are
old
fellow
you
bleat
like
a
lamb
instead
of
roaring
like
a
lion
now
tell
me
what
do
you
see
in
my
face
mockery
and
scorn
was
the
answer
scorn
of
me
and
the
lord
above
us
that
is
all
i
see
well
then
you
do
see
half
if
you
had
the
faintest
conception
of
who
it
is
stands
before
you
here
you
would
hurry
off
as
fast
as
your
fat
legs
would
permit
you
come
and
talk
to
me
about
affairs
of
honour
to
me
and
i
am
little
more
already
than
a
living
corpse
you
want
me
to
singe
a
hole
in
your
son
body
so
that
in
a
time
he
be
all
right
again
and
able
to
swagger
with
renewed
cocksureness
for
that
is
what
you
are
driving
at
with
all
these
sugary
entreaties
but
no
my
old
friend
i
am
not
to
be
got
over
with
any
such
artifice
murder
is
in
my
heart
a
cloud
of
blood
hangs
before
my
eyes
you
too
seem
to
be
swimming
in
it
and
the
lamp
and
everything
is
red
and
dull
from
undiluted
blood
now
you
know
what
i
am
and
i
will
tell
you
what
more
i
am
going
to
be
a
perjurer
a
cowardly
hound
sneaking
out
of
the
world
in
his
thwarted
lust
and
desperation
i
have
desecrated
the
hearth
of
my
dearest
friend
with
my
unlawful
passions
and
i
am
going
now
to
sprinkle
it
with
blood
rather
than
play
the
basest
part
of
all
towards
him
yes
i
shall
heap
scandal
on
scandal
so
that
you
will
be
ashamed
old
man
that
you
ever
knew
me
and
the
fine
wines
that
you
have
drunk
under
my
roof
will
taste
as
bitter
as
gall
in
your
remembrance
so
tipple
some
more
of
it

health
to
your
health
old
priest
and
he
drank
drank
the
whole
bottle
empty
and
dashed
it
into
a
corner
the
pastor
stood
like
a
man
turned
to
stone
he
tried
to
speak
but
speech
forsook
him
you
think
me
a
fool
i
dare
say
to
blurt
out
all
this
leo
continued
but
i
tell
you
why
i
do
it
simply
because
i
resist
the
tempting
opportunity
of
holding
a
reckoning
with
you
for
who
is
to
blame
for
the
whole
business
why
you
you
first
of
all
and
then
johanna
between
you
you
have
hounded
me
into
this
slough
where
i
must
sink
you
began
it
in
the
autumn
i
spoke
my
mind
to
you
but
then
i
was
an
angel
of
god
compared
with
what
i
am
and
did
not
foresee
the
end
repent
i
was
to
repent
repent
repent
did
i
raise
my
hands
in
and
implore
you
to
leave
me
alone
leave
me
to
live
my
life
in
my
own
way
but
you
had
no
mercy
neither
you
nor
johanna
nor
who
now
is
driven
to
the
same
extremity
as
i
am

to
send
us
to
the
devil
but
now
it
is
your
turn

had
no
mercy
on
me

so

will
show
you

your
charming

heal
his
injured
skin
as
best
he
can
let
him
lay
dock

on
the
wounds
or
ammonia
which
he
likes
and
let
him
heal
his
outraged
honour
with

out

christian
he
opened
the
door
christian
help
the
herr
pastor
on
with
his
coat
good
night
so
saying
he
threw
himself
full
length
on
the
sofa
and
drummed
on
the
leather
with
his
heels
taking
no
further
notice
of
the
pastor
proceedings
the
latter
staggered
out
hardly
knowing
what
he
did
the
cold
night
air
brought
him
to
his
senses
he
paused
under
the
courtyard
gateway
and
considered
then
instead
of
taking
the
road
home
to
wengern
he
skirted
the
park
palings
in
the
deep
snow
and
went
to
the
there
he
thundered
with
the
knocker
till
he
brought
a
half
asleep
to
the
door
and
asked
to
speak
to
old
frau
gräfin
instantly
the
next
morning
at
eight
a
telegram
was
despatched
from
the
at
münsterberg
by
pastor

deutches

in
xxxviii
felicitas
returned
from
her
last
interview
with
leo
glowing
and
intoxicated
with
the
idea
of
death
what
a
harmonious
ending
it
would
be
to
die
in
the
arms
of
her
lover
breathing
her
last
breath
on
his
lips
she
recalled
a
picture
that
she
had
once
seen
in
königsberg
afterwards
famous
all
over
the
continent
it
was
called
tired
of
life
and
represented
a
man
and
a
woman
who
had
bound
themselves
together
with
ropes
and
were
about
to
hurl
themselves
from
some
steps
in
the
foreground
into
the
sea
she
had
felt
an
envious
tremour
then
and
now
all
at
once
the
old
foolish
dream
was
to
be
fulfilled
at
leo
side
she
had
nothing
to
bind
her
to
life
in
every
way
it
would
be
best
to
quit
it
ulrich
became
more
and
more
of
an
invalid
and
less
and
less
disposed
to
make
things
bearable
for
her
the
society
of
the
neighbourhood
afforded
her
no
consolation
the
women
hated
her
the
men
persecuted
her
with
their
love
and
one
was
as
unsatisfying
and
dull
as
the
other
the
future
promised
her
nothing
she
saw
herself
slowly
fading
away
bored
to
extinction
by
discussion
about
the
crops
and
new
scientific
theories
of
drainage
of
farm
and
dairy
management
to
die
now
would
be
a
thousand
times
preferable
if
only
i
had
my
little
paul
she
thought
there
would
at
least
be
something
to
live
for
and
the
momentary
of
the
maternal
instinct
within
her
filled
her
eyes
with
hot
tears
but
in
the
midst
of
her
tender
compassion
for
herself
and
her
dead
child
the
thought
seized
her
like
an
icy
hand
that
in
a
few
days
she
like
him
would
be
lying
in
the
dark
damp
earth
was
it
possible
could
it
be
in
a
year
or
better
still
in
ten
years
time
after
this
love
had
burned
itself
out
it
would
be
all
very
well
but
now
when
a
new
happiness
lay
before
them
and
would
have
to
be
left
untasted
unenjoyed
would
it
not
be
folly
once
more
she
thought
of
the
picture
tired
of
life
and
derived
a
little
solace
from
it
the
man
had
not
been
in
the
least
like
leo
as
far
as
she
could
remember
he
had
worn
a
velvet
coat
like
an
artist
or
something
of
the
kind
oh
yes
artists
with
their
wide
views
and
great
minds
were
the
men
who
understood
the
hearts
of
women
and
how
to
drag
them
into
eternity
she
was
sure
about
the
velvet
coat
after
all
but
the
woman
white
satin
dress
she
remembered
distinctly
it
had
fitted
like
gleaming
armour
over
the
bust
that
was
the
fashion
now
but
what
did
fashions
matter
when
one
was
going
to
die
the
only
thing
that
mattered
was
to
look
beautiful
in
death
and
she
began
to
consider
what
she
should
put
on
among
her
peignoirs
and
de
she
possessed
one
of
softest
de
which
fell
in
straight
greek
folds
and
was
drawn
in
above
the
waist
by
a
golden
girdle
she
had
ordered
it
from
paris
before
her
second
marriage
and
had
been
keeping
it
for
some
special
occasion
this
occasion
would
certainly
have
arrived
now
if
leo
had
not
got
hold
of
the
stupid
idea
that
they
must
creep
out
into
the
to
put
an
end
to
themselves
in
any
case
she
would
not
forego
the
pleasure
of
trying
on
the
artistic
garment
she
locked
the
doors
put
shades
of
pink
gauze
on
the
candles
and
undressed
as
she
stood
before
the
glass
her
figure
in
the
graceful
greek
draperies
illumined
seductively
by
the
subdued
purple
light
she
was
ravished
by
the
sight
of
her
own
beauty
he
must
see
her
like
this
just
for
one
second
and
all
thought
of
dying
would
be
abandoned
how
glad
she
was
that
she
had
extracted
that
promise
from
him
at
the
last
to
come
and
fetch
her
when
she
met
him
thus
attired
what
else
could
he
do
but
snatch
her
in
his
arms
and
instead
of
dying
with
her
in
the
gruesome
manner
that
he
had
proposed
he
would
tread
again
at
her
side
the
primrose
path
of
passion
which
rhaden
jealousy
had
so
hatefully
interrupted
yes
so
she
would
win
him
back
to
her
altogether
her
big
adoring
boy
but
the
night
that
she
passed
before
this
contemplated
enjoyment
was
anything
but
peaceful
she
recalled
his
face
when
he
had
said
this
time
it
will
be
no
joke
we
shall
not
drink
toothache
drops
and
even
granted
that
she
could
bring
him
to
reason
there
was
always
the
vision
of
johanna
hovering
in
the
background
eager
to
shatter
their
bliss
was
there
no
way
out
of
it
she
pondered
and
pondered
till
her
head
ached
staring
into
the
darkness
with
wide
anxious
eyes
the
plan
that
she
hit
on
at
last
did
not
differ
eventually
by
a
hair
breadth
from
the
one
which
leo
had
rejected
as
unworthy
she
would
write
to
ulrich
and
impress
on
him
how
johanna
brain
was
becoming
more
unhinged
every
day
she
would
give
striking
examples
of
it
pity
and
defend
the
unfortunate
creature
hint
at
a
pending
catastrophe
and
so
prepare
his
mind
for
having
to
deal
with
the
delusions
of
a
mad
woman
if
she
should
really
make
a
betrayal
of
her
secret
that
would
do
beautifully
and
content
at
last
she
quietly
fell
asleep
the
whole
of
the
next
day
she
was
in
a
more
or
less
happy
mood
a
kind
of
bridal
excitement
quickened
the
blood
in
her
veins
it
was
true
that
every
now
and
then
a
sickening
memory
of
leo
overcame
her
but
she
was
too
confident
of
the
victorious
power
of
her
beauty
which
of
old
had
held
his
senses
captive
to
entertain
any
serious
fears
she
leaned
back
dreamily
in
a
chair
by
the
window
and
stared
across
the
stream
in
the
direction
of
halewitz
counting
the
hours
old
minna
who
the
day
before
had
been
told
of
leo
coming
midnight
visit
and
had
received
her
instructions
ventured
as
she
hobbled
through
the
room
to
assist
her
mistress
in
this
employment
now
it
is
only
eight
hours
gracious
little
lady
and
then
only
seven
and
a
half
now
and
so
the
time
grew
shorter
at
dusk
a
powdering
of
snow
began
to
fall
renewing
the
purity
of
the
grey
plains
and
quickly
obliterating
the
roads
laughing
blissfully
she
began
to
beat
with
her
fingers
on
the
and
to
sing
a
song
of
the
knight
who
came
through
floods
and
tempests
and
by
dangerous
paths
to
greet
his
lady
love
then
she
thought
of
her
dead
boy
and
shed
a
few
tears
ah
my
little
son
she
murmured
clasping
her
hands
you
may
be
glad
that
you
have
found
eternal
peace
so
early
and
this
made
her
joyous
again
and
so
she
passed
a
highly
agreeable
afternoon
giving
herself
up
to
pleasant
dreams
and
she
was
no
further
troubled
by
suspense
at
five
the
lamps
were
brought
in
and
towards
eight
supper
was
served
half
an
hour
later
a
housemaid
rushed
in
greatly
excited
and
announced
that
the
gnädiger
herr
had
driven
into
the
courtyard
which
gnädiger
herr
felicitas
asked
so
calm
and
was
her
mood
that
she
did
in
the
least
grasp
what
had
happened
the
maid
repeated
her
information
and
her
first
emotion
was
one
of
resentment
at
her
husband
coming
home
she
would
have
liked
to
beg
him
to
turn
round
and
go
away
again
only
gradually
did
she
become
alive
to
the
danger
which
hung
over
her
she
remained
sitting
at
the
supper
tablet
and
rolled
up
her
serviette
johanna
has
played
me
this
trick
she
thought
for
she
hated
her
old
friend
so
intensely
that
she
attributed
to
her
any
evil
that
befell
her
as
a
matter
of
course
but
the
next
moment
she
was
convinced
of
the
groundlessness
of
her
suspicion
in
was
quite
impossible
that
johanna
could
know
anything
of
what
she
had
planned
for
her
meeting
with
ulrich
seemed
to
confirm
this
although
for
a
moment
the
first
searching
look
that
he
fixed
on
her
was
full
of
uneasiness
he
soon
became
reassured
at
finding
her
sitting
over
the
remains
of
her
supper
in
solitude
the
alarming
telegram
had
so
far
had
effect
that
it
had
brought
him
back
to
uhlenfelde
unannounced
post
haste
in
a
hired
sleigh
but
if
he
did
not
in
answer
to
lizzie
questions
give
the
reason
of
his
sudden
return
it
was
simply
to
spare
his
wife
unnecessary
anxiety
rather
than
because
he
mistrusted
her
he
knew
johanna
of
old
she
had
always
looked
on
the
blackest
side
of
things
and
her
warning
might
concern
some
question
of
estate
management
he
resolved
to
drive
over
to
halewitz
early
the
next
morning
and
to
be
content
only
to
subject
house
yard
and
staff
to
a
more
stringent
examination
than
was
usual
on
the
day
of
his
coming
home
he
felt
limp
and
and
his
wife
persistent
chatter
pained
him
as
soon
as
he
could
he
rose
from
the
table
to
start
on
his
round
with
the
bailiffs
scarcely
had
he
vanished
through
the
door
than
old
minna
ran
in
wringing
her
hands
ah
gracious
little
mistress
gracious
one
she
whispered
we
must
send
word
to
halewitz
at
once
otherwise
something
dreadful
may
happen
felicitas
reflected
if
leo
heard
of
ulrich
return
it
was
not
improbable
that
he
might
change
his
tactics
and
to
avoid
a
meeting
with
him
go
back
to
his
original
intention
of
flight
then
she
would
be
left
behind
to
mourn
for
him
to
the
end
of
her
days
on
the
other
hand
if
he
were
allowed
to
come
and
all
due
precaution
taken
there
would
not
be
a
shadow
of
risk
at
fichtkampen
minna
had
often
brought
him
to
her
in
ten
times
more
difficult
circumstances
and
besides
when
she
considered
the
matter
more
closely
she
saw
an
unspeakable
advantage
in
ulrich
presence
should
dear
old
leo
refuse
to
be
weaned
altogether
from
his
suicidal
resolve
she
would
only
have
to
tell
him
who
had
come
home
that
day
and
was
sleeping
in
the
room
through
the
to
bring
him
to
a
tractable
and
peaceable
frame
of
mind
this
decided
her
stay
where
you
are
minna
she
said
you
know
all
the
secrets
of
the
house
and
if
you
manage
to
smuggle
him
in
all
right
i
will
give
you
another
silk
dress
towards
ten
ulrich
came
back
from
his
walk
he
reported
himself
dead
tired
and
said
that
he
would
retire
to
his
room
and
mind
you
go
to
bed
at
once
felicitas
said
he
nodded
assent
and
kissed
her
on
forehead
and
hand
according
to
his
habit
when
saying
good
night
how
hot
your
cheeks
are
he
remarked
i
am
so
glad
that
you
are
here
she
answered
and
she
did
not
lie
this
time
it
will
be
no
joke
we
shall
not
drink
toothache
drops
again
those
words
of
leo
occurred
to
her
unpleasantly
she
lighted
her
husband
upstairs
closed
the
shutters
in
his
room
and
looked
at
the
thermometer
to
see
that
he
was
neither
too
warm
nor
too
cold
for
the
night
then
saying
good
night
once
more
she
left
him
and
went
down
again
to
give
minna
some
last
hints
when
she
entered
her
bedroom
half
an
hour
later
she
heard
ulrich
still
pacing
up
and
down
that
was
fatal
she
dared
not
put
on
the
de
peignoir
yet
lest
he
should
surprise
her
in
it
for
though
their
present
relations
were
such
that
he
would
not
come
to
her
for
conjugal
reasons
he
might
hearing
her
move
at
any
moment
open
the
door
and
ask
some
question
so
she
contented
herself
with
arranging
her
hair
la
and
giving
her
face
a
soft
film
of
powder
the
peignoir
lay
spread
out
ready
in
the
the
clock
struck
eleven
still
another
hour
what
should
she
do
to
kill
time
she
sat
down
at
the
and
began
to
turn
over
old
papers
with
a
tremulous
hand
a
happy
idea
came
into
her
head
she
would
begin
a
new
existence
from
this
hour
an
existence
full
of
glorious
joy
and
imperishable
youth
a
masque
of
spring
a
midsummer
night
dream
a
revel
of
sweetest
lightest
laughter
for
this
end
all
that
had
any
connection
with
years
of
shame
and
tormenting
anguish
must
be
destroyed
and
burnt
nothing
should
be
left
nothing
but
him
whom
after
what
sacrifices
god
only
knew
she
had
at
last
reconquered
she
tore
letter
after
letter
into
little
pieces
they
contained
declarations
of
love
of
every
description
ranging
from
the
sentimental
balderdash
of
young
neuhaus
to
the
cynical
quips
of
old
stolt
as
she
read
them
she
laughed
if
he
had
not
come
home
she
thought
i
should
have
had
to
give
myself
to
one
or
the
other
then
her
hand
fell
on
her
dead
boy
little
packet
of
letters
a
cold
shiver
ran
through
her
but
she
would
be
sad
she
would
not
he
was
happily
at
rest
for
ever
her
dear
paulchen
still
it
was
not
easy
to
destroy
his
letters
but
it
must
be
done
for
it
was
more
necessary
than
anything
else
she
kissed
the
poor
little
packet
then
slowly
tore
the
first
sheet
across
and
the
second
the
clock
chimed
eleven
and
she
started
up
and
listened
breathing
hard
into
the
darkness
of
the
ulrich
tired
footsteps
still
echoed
from
the
room
beyond
up
and
down
up
and
down
the
minutes
flew
and
there
lay
the
greek
costume
waiting
to
be
donned
might
she
dare
she
array
herself
in
it
now
with
bent
ear
she
listened
and
listened
it
was
too
late
to
turn
back
punctually
at
midnight
leo
von
sellenthin
entered
the
bedroom
of
ulrich
kletzingk
wife
to
take
her
with
him
to
meet
death
as
they
had
agreed
to
meet
it
when
she
heard
the
door
behind
her
creak
on
its
hinges
she
sprang
back
from
her
post
and
softly
drew
the
bolt
only
then
had
she
the
courage
to
look
round
her
first
emotion
as
she
beheld
him
standing
at
the
door
was
one
of
intense
chagrin
that
at
this
tryst
she
should
appear
before
him
as
black
as
a
crow
and
this
wound
to
her
vanity
put
even
the
threat
of
death
out
of
her
head
he
wore
a
long
which
completely
hid
his
arms
and
he
was
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
snow
is
it
still
snowing
she
asked
and
wiped
his
moustache
from
which
icicles
hung
with
her
my
poor
darling
how
wet
you
are
he
did
not
stir
or
even
take
the
fur
cap
from
his
head
you
stand
there
like
a
post
she
said
why
do
you
take
off
your
things
and
as
he
continued
motionless
she
unbuttoned
his
collar
for
him
and
the
heavy
cloak
slipped
off
his
shoulders
on
to
the
floor
she
fancied
she
heard
something
hard
in
its
folds
strike
against
the
panelling
of
the
wall
what
was
that
she
inquired
terrified
nothing
he
growled
and
blew
through
his
teeth
in
an
attempt
to
laugh
a
cold
shudder
ran
through
her
what
a
good
thing
ulrich
is
there
she
thought
had
she
been
alone
with
leo
in
the
house
she
would
have
been
horribly
frightened
then
she
threw
both
arms
round
his
neck
and
pillowed
her
head
against
his
breast
thus
she
stood
for
a
few
minutes
murmuring
now
i
have
got
you
all
to
myself
but
you
must
be
very
quiet
she
added
quickly
in
a
warning
tone
for
some
one
is
sleeping
not
far
off
he
nodded
and
do
you
love
me
she
saw
his
face
change
and
felt
how
he
trembled
she
pressed
her
hands
against
her
breast
breathing
rapidly
i
must
do
it
now
she
said
to
herself
it
was
no
matter
whether
he
was
asleep
over
there
or
not
she
took
a
box
of
matches
from
the
bedside
table
and
said
smiling
wait
a
minute
dearest
i
have
something
to
attend
to
she
disappeared
softly
bolting
the
door
as
she
went
leo
still
stood
on
the
same
spot
here
i
am
at
my
goal
he
thought
then
he
let
his
eyes
wander
round
the
room
in
dull
curiosity
he
looked
at
the
lamp
hanging
from
the
ceiling
and
noticed
that
the
silken
befringed
shade
was
at
fichtkampen
it
had
been
blue
the
difference
impressed
itself
on
his
mind
which
seemed
incapable
of
taking
in
anything
else
he
wished
that
she
would
come
back
so
that
he
need
stand
there
feeling
so
stupid
and
wretched
then
he
remembered
the
smiling
promises
with
which
she
had
parted
from
him
the
other
day
a
pang
of
anxiety
mingled
with
a
weak
hope
to
which
he
could
not
give
a
name
overwhelmed
him
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
she
had
the
power
of
paralysing
his
limbs
and
draining
the
marrow
from
his
bones
what
am
i
doing
here
he
stammered
looking
round
with
a
wild
glance
why
have
i
come
five
ten
minutes
passed
and
she
did
not
reappear
he
stared
at
the
door
through
which
she
had
vanished
it
was
certain
that
she
had
another
scheme
on
hand
whatever
it
might
be
she
would
find
him
pliable
as
putty
how
tired
he
was
he
dragged
himself
to
the
chair
on
which
she
had
been
sitting
before
he
came
in
he
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
and
brooded
absently
over
the
papers
and
letters
which
were
strewn
about
the
my
dear
mamma
nearly
all
the
boys
are
going
home
for
christmas
eric
froben
will
stay
here
because
he
has
no
mamma
and
fritz
lawsky
because
he
has
only
a
guardian
and
who
comes
from
india
and
is
as
yellow
as
a
gruyére
cheese
all
the
other
boys
are
going
home
why
may
i
come
home
some
have
a
longer
journey
to
their
homes
than
i
have
oh
i
do
want
to
come
home
so
badly
i
cry
every
morning
and
every
night
because
i
may
come
home
he
had
read
so
far
mechanically
hardly
conscious
that
he
was
not
reading
the
advertisement
column
of
a
newspaper
when
suddenly
he
awoke
to
the
reality
he
took
the
sheet
in
both
hands
and
turned
it
over
and
over
while
a
sound
like
a
faint
whine
came
from
his
throat
with
fixed
fierce
eyes
he
read
on
he
read
of
the
distribution
of
presents
beneath
the
christmas
tree
of
the
bell
which
would
be
rung
when
the
happy
hour
came
what
the
boy
from
india
was
to
get
he
did
not
skip
one
of
the
childish
wishes
from
the
lead
soldiers
to
the
pocket
inkstand
and
the
sweets
he
half
rejoiced
that
each
item
stabbed
his
breast
like
a
sharp
sword
he
seemed
to
hear
a
child
voice
crying
out
of
the
distance
and
the
night
uncle
leo
uncle
leo
he
sprang
to
his
feet
his
mind
was
made
up
lifting
his
cloak
from
the
floor
he
threw
it
over
his
shoulder
and
tapped
and
tested
the
double
trigger
of
the
weapon
that
was
ready
for
coming
events
in
the
and
so
he
waited
armed
and
prepared
then
noiselessly
the
door
opened
a
figure
stood
on
the
threshold
with
the
rosy
light
of
the
lamp
cast
full
upon
it
the
softly
rounded
arms
were
lifted
longingly
in
an
arch
above
her
head
displaying
her
full
breasts
the
white
drapery
fell
from
her
plump
shoulders
in
straight
unbroken
folds
to
her
pink
bare
feet
she
stood
there
like
the
very
goddess
of
love
although
there
was
nothing
divine
truly
about
the
small
round
face
with
its
nose
and
sensuous
lips
he
looked
at
her
and
she
seemed
the
incarnation
of
the
sin
to
which
he
had
been
an
easy
victim
from
the
first
the
smiling
flattering
sin
that
meant
no
harm
yet
stalked
on
its
complacent
way
over
all
hindrances
even
over
the
body
of
the
dead
wrath
and
disgust
convulsed
him
it
was
for
this
then
that
he
had
come
for
this
she
on
her
side
expected
that
he
would
rush
at
her
with
an
exclamation
of
delight
and
as
ulrich
was
not
yet
asleep
she
gave
a
warning
hush
then
she
let
the
door
fall
back
in
the
lock
with
experienced
caution
still
he
did
not
move
and
misinterpreting
his
stupefaction
she
determined
to
give
him
courage
she
glided
across
the
room
and
nestling
against
him
she
whispered
half
roguishly
half
humbly
there
now
you
have
come
into
your
property
her
bare
arms
encircled
his
neck
but
he
pushed
her
away
from
him
with
swift
decision
listen
felicitas
he
said
fighting
for
breath
i
have
just
read
a
letter
from
your
boy
after
that
i
have
no
inclination
to
make
love
to
you
neither
can
i
take
you
with
me
now
it
would
seem
like
murder
die
where
and
how
you
like
but
excuse
me
i
must
be
going
at
the
mention
of
the
letter
she
had
started
back
but
now
she
smiled
once
more
and
pressed
herself
against
him
with
renewed
ardour
but
dearest
she
whispered
do
think
any
more
about
that
stupid
plan
what
stupid
plan
why
about
death
and
dying
what
do
you
see
she
whispered
stroking
his
cheeks
radiantly
confident
of
conquest
it
would
be
utterly
ridiculous
to
die
now
why
should
we
just
when
we
have
got
each
other
again
it
seems
to
me
that
we
shall
begin
to
live
now
for
the
first
time
in
blank
astonishment
he
gazed
at
her
he
had
been
so
accustomed
during
the
last
hours
to
regard
himself
and
her
as
destined
that
night
for
death
that
he
could
hardly
grasp
the
ignoble
course
her
lips
proposed
when
he
had
grasped
it
he
was
threatened
by
one
of
his
old
furious
rages
the
mist
floated
before
his
eyes
and
a
voice
cried
within
him
end
it
wretched
woman
he
said
and
caught
at
his
she
noticed
his
action
and
saw
the
blue
gleam
of
steel
flash
towards
her
in
deadly
terror
she
shrieked
for
help
before
he
had
time
to
cock
the
pistol
she
had
fled
into
the
crying
in
a
shrill
piercing
voice
help
murder
help
beast
he
muttered
and
put
the
weapon
down
on
the
for
a
moment
he
stood
irresolute
not
sure
whether
to
attempt
escape
or
let
himself
be
found
where
he
was
then
he
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
standing
on
the
dark
threshold
a
tall
form
it
was
ulrich
and
the
woman
was
grovelling
at
his
feet
leo
felt
no
shock
of
surprise
now
he
knows
was
his
first
thought
knows
and
he
wondered
coolly
how
he
would
take
it
speak
said
ulrich
in
a
voice
that
was
strange
to
leo
what
are
you
doing
here
it
seemed
as
if
he
grew
taller
and
taller
speak
said
the
strange
voice
a
second
time
he
was
going
to
murder
me
sobbed
felicitas
kneeling
before
him
in
her
nakedness
because
i
would
do
what
he
wanted
he
was
going
to
murder
me
leo
came
a
step
nearer
his
hands
itched
to
strangle
her
before
she
could
lie
further
but
ulrich
eyes
petrified
him
do
listen
to
her
he
stammered
but
shoot
me
down
here
i
am
the
figure
in
the
door
began
to
reel
and
a
long
bony
hand
was
stretched
out
to
the
wall
for
support
can
he
survive
it
thought
leo
in
readiness
to
catch
him
if
he
fell
but
ulrich
with
an
effort
pulled
himself
together
not
here
he
said
we
will
meet
at
daylight
where
on
the
isle
of
friendship
leo
very
well
on
the
isle
of
friendship
and
he
turned
to
the
door
outside
old
minna
was
waiting
in
the
darkness
make
haste
sir
he
heard
her
say
there
are
people
moving
about
already
down
below
xxxix
a
pale
snowy
twilight
came
through
the
window
leo
sprang
up
in
bed
where
he
had
slept
for
four
hours
in
his
clothes
like
a
dead
man
he
extinguished
the
lamp
which
smoked
still
burning
near
him
on
the
table
now
it
seemed
to
be
almost
night
again
it
was
a
seven
by
his
watch
at
eight
it
will
be
daylight
he
thought
if
i
start
then
i
shall
be
early
enough
then
slowly
as
one
recalls
a
wild
dream
he
went
over
again
the
events
of
the
past
night
why
had
she
not
turned
him
back
at
the
garden
gate
when
she
knew
ulrich
was
in
the
house
for
a
moment
he
entertained
the
mad
suspicion
that
she
had
laid
a
trap
for
him
but
the
next
he
rejected
it
as
unlikely
he
had
not
quite
regained
clear
consciousness
his
forehead
ached
his
eyes
burned
a
confused
medley
of
thoughts
and
images
passed
through
his
brain
and
then
there
leapt
up
within
him
an
illuminating
flame
of
certainty
now
he
knows
now
he
knows
he
knows
it
was
all
over
with
hypocrisy
lying
and
evasion
nervous
anxiety
and
enervating
desire
the
long
corrupting
process
to
which
his
inner
man
had
been
subjected
had
reached
its
finality
once
more
he
might
draw
a
deep
free
breath
from
his
sorely
weighted
lungs
he
thrust
open
the
window
and
breathed
in
long
draughts
of
the
air
which
braced
and
refreshed
him
his
mood
was
now
so
clear
and
calm
that
he
felt
as
if
body
and
soul
had
been
purified
and
hallowed
in
that
white
mantle
of
snow
the
flakes
descended
in
whirling
columns
they
seemed
to
push
and
struggle
with
each
other
as
to
which
should
first
reach
the
earth
they
hid
the
yard
in
impenetrable
clouds
only
here
and
there
a
gable
or
a
stable
window
peeped
out
on
the
of
snowflakes
he
had
taken
farewell
already
of
his
belongings
had
consigned
to
ruin
with
rage
and
scorn
the
heritage
that
had
come
down
to
him
from
his
forefathers
but
it
was
with
calm
resignation
that
he
relinquished
everything
that
his
heart
had
so
long
held
dear
a
supreme
indifference
to
all
that
had
happened
and
was
yet
to
happen
overcame
him
even
the
wrong
that
he
had
done
ulrich
no
longer
deeply
affected
him
he
would
let
him
shoot
him
dead
and
then
but
suppose
he
should
miss
what
if
his
hand
trembled
it
could
not
it
must
not
to
outlive
this
day
was
unthinkable
he
would
receive
the
sanctifying
bullet
in
silence
in
grateful
silence
that
he
had
been
allowed
to
die
an
honourable
death
he
drew
down
his
case
of
pistols
oiled
and
tested
the
triggers
and
put
his
eye
to
their
mouths
on
the
butt
end
of
one
he
found
the
little
cross
scratched
with
a
knife
the
mark
which
he
had
made
years
ago
to
distinguish
the
pistol
which
had
killed
rhaden
from
the
others
then
he
loaded
it
and
before
doing
so
he
held
the
bullets
in
his
palm
and
passed
his
other
hand
almost
affectionately
over
the
leaden
pellets
slowly
the
day
advanced
one
thing
he
had
to
do
which
would
be
more
difficult
than
it
had
been
yesterday
and
that
was
to
take
a
mute
farewell
of
his
loved
ones
the
day
before
he
had
slunk
into
the
house
like
a
thief
in
the
night
he
could
scarcely
resist
the
longing
to
press
openly
a
parting
kiss
on
his
mother
brow
but
she
was
still
asleep
and
as
he
went
by
her
door
he
stroked
the
latch
with
his
hand
that
was
his
the
only
person
he
met
face
to
face
was
hertha
he
found
her
in
the
as
he
came
into
it
to
get
a
drink
of
something
warming
she
wore
a
white
smock
over
her
dark
and
the
lamplight
which
struggled
with
the
dawn
shone
on
her
smooth
hair
she
started
at
the
sound
of
his
morning
greeting
for
it
was
a
long
time
since
such
a
thing
had
happened
as
his
appearing
at
breakfast
up
already
hertha
yes
of
course
she
gasped
i
have
been
going
to
the
milking
again
lately
and
then
she
pressed
her
elbows
nervously
against
her
sides
as
if
she
was
afraid
that
she
had
said
too
much
and
cast
her
eyes
shyly
along
the
table
that
is
capital
he
said
will
you
pour
me
out
a
cup
of
coffee
when
the
water
boils
she
answered
and
busied
herself
with
the
flame
of
the
he
sat
down
opposite
her
and
as
he
looked
at
her
he
thought
there
sits
one
who
should
have
been
my
housewife
and
he
held
a
silent
burial
all
the
hopes
of
his
youth
his
dreams
of
happiness
his
unspoken
wish
for
wife
and
children
and
the
small
dear
comforts
of
a
home
all
that
was
best
and
purest
within
him
that
he
had
imagined
dead
long
ago
at
this
moment
when
he
was
conscious
it
still
lived
he
laid
in
a
solemn
grave
she
brewed
the
coffee
and
the
porcelain
filter
trembled
in
her
hand
then
she
handed
him
a
steaming
cup
he
drank
it
and
she
began
to
move
towards
the
door
do
go
my
child
he
said
eager
to
enjoy
to
the
full
these
few
minutes
stay
with
me
she
paused
irresolute
her
eyes
wide
with
wonder
then
she
slowly
went
back
to
her
place
he
did
not
speak
to
her
again
and
for
something
to
do
she
cut
bread
and
butter
the
clock
struck
eight
and
he
sprang
up
now
for
it
old
boy
now
for
it
at
the
door
he
stopped
and
looked
back
she
was
sitting
turned
away
from
him
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
her
industrious
hands
fallen
idly
in
her
lap
and
now
the
anguish
of
parting
unmanned
him
he
came
behind
her
and
bending
her
head
backwards
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
forehead
with
a
gentle
caress
he
saw
the
colour
deepen
in
her
cheeks
and
her
two
rows
of
regular
white
teeth
shining
between
her
anxiously
parted
lips
and
he
looked
into
her
large
frightened
eyes
my
dear
child
he
said
my
dear
dear
child
their
eyes
melted
into
each
other
and
from
the
depths
of
her
breast
came
a
short
gurgling
sob
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
child
he
went
on
and
you
would
have
done
still
more
for
me
if
i
had
let
you
and
in
return
i
have
been
bearish
and
rough
to
you
forgive
me
i
would
like
to
make
up
for
it
but
it
may
not
be
may
not
be
stay
with
my
mother
dear
you
are
the
only
one
who
can
keep
a
cool
head
he
kissed
her
rigid
lips
softly
and
hurried
away
outside
the
falling
snow
hung
like
a
thick
veil
over
the
fields
not
a
breath
of
wind
not
a
sound
came
out
of
the
distance
the
trees
became
blurred
in
the
dense
silent
dance
of
the
flakes
they
looked
almost
as
if
they
were
tied
up
in
bags
so
entirely
were
they
wrapped
in
the
snowy
foam
beneath
his
feet
the
fine
new
snow
rose
over
his
boots
at
every
step
and
flew
before
him
in
little
powdery
clouds
road
and
path
were
quite
lost
to
view
and
one
had
to
grope
one
way
over
the
ground
step
by
step
leo
felt
warm
under
his
heavy
cloak
and
the
weight
of
his
case
of
pistols
oppressed
him
too
he
opened
his
mouth
and
swallowed
as
many
of
the
flying
crystals
as
he
could
catch
for
his
throat
burned
then
he
took
off
his
cap
and
let
the
cooling
flakes
fall
refreshingly
on
his
bare
head
would
he
be
there
he
asked
himself
and
the
thought
of
a
personal
meeting
alarmed
him
more
than
the
prospect
of
death
my
god
what
sort
of
a
meeting
will
it
be
he
stammered
and
grew
hot
all
over
they
would
have
to
speak
to
each
other
they
could
not
glare
from
their
respective
posts
and
then
fall
on
one
another
without
a
word
like
two
red
indians
and
suddenly
in
a
flash
the
thought
came
to
him
suppose
you
are
so
bad
that
he
declines
to
waste
powder
and
shot
on
you
he
held
his
breath
for
a
moment
almost
petrified
with
shame
then
he
roused
himself
and
ran
with
all
his
might
through
the
reeds
and
over
the
groaning
ice
to
the
spot
where
finis
was
to
be
written
on
everything
on
the
frozen
little
bay
whereby
it
was
alone
possible
to
reach
the
island
he
found
footprints
which
must
have
been
quite
freshly
made
though
the
snow
had
half
covered
them
up
already
this
first
sign
of
his
friend
waiting
presence
made
his
heart
rise
to
his
throat
he
tore
on
following
the
up
the
steep
incline
to
the
clearing
which
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
snowstorm
for
a
moment
anxiety
at
what
was
to
come
made
him
giddy
death
was
mere
child
play
compared
with
the
inevitable
conversation
that
must
precede
it
he
leaned
against
a
tree
to
get
his
breath
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
instead
of
the
white
flakes
a
shower
of
red
and
blue
flames
were
falling
around
him
and
then
he
made
a
last
great
effort
to
shake
off
all
cowardice
and
stepped
on
to
the
open
space
to
offer
his
heart
as
a
target
to
his
friend
but
he
could
see
no
sign
of
him
on
all
sides
the
white
noiseless
tumult
the
dark
interior
of
the
temple
making
the
one
shadow
in
the
milky
lightness
but
nowhere
any
trace
of
a
human
figure
he
walked
the
length
of
the
clearing
took
a
rapid
glance
in
passing
at
the
two
statues
spied
into
the
thicket
hunted
at
the
back
of
the
temple
and
at
last
he
found
him
first
of
all
his
foot
struck
against
a
case
of
pistols
like
his
own
and
then
he
saw
lying
stretched
out
at
the
foot
of
the
sacrificial
stone
the
outline
of
a
man
figure
already
half
covered
with
snow
with
a
cry
he
darted
to
his
side
raised
him
into
an
upright
position
in
his
arms
and
wiped
the
snow
off
his
face
it
was
like
the
face
of
a
corpse
the
eyes
were
shut
the
lips
colourless
and
his
skin
as
leo
touched
it
felt
deathly
cold
against
his
caressing
hands
half
out
of
his
mind
with
a
dread
fear
he
pressed
his
ear
listening
against
the
motionless
chest
a
slight
irregular
tremour
told
him
that
there
was
still
life
in
the
body
and
as
his
fear
was
conquered
a
great
passion
of
tenderness
came
over
him
with
the
force
of
an
avalanche
which
swept
away
sin
and
pain
and
and
desire
for
death
by
the
roots
as
if
they
had
never
been
triumphantly
the
joy
of
the
old
full
and
undivided
possession
of
his
friend
broke
forth
again
at
this
moment
he
would
live
for
him
his
only
care
should
be
to
love
and
serve
him
he
would
laugh
so
that
he
should
learn
to
laugh
again
lie
at
his
feet
like
a
faithful
dog
yes
all
this
he
vowed
to
do
as
he
felt
a
new
strength
brace
his
limbs
and
a
new
hope
expand
his
soul
now
at
any
rate
so
long
as
he
hung
lifeless
in
his
arms
he
belonged
to
him
and
no
one
else
he
alone
was
there
to
warm
and
cherish
him
and
to
rub
his
brow
as
of
old
he
carried
him
to
the
temple
of
friendship
spread
his
cloak
for
him
to
lie
upon
and
wrapped
the
corners
over
his
breast
and
when
he
saw
that
the
cloak
was
not
sufficient
to
cover
the
long
limbs
altogether
be
wrenched
off
his
coat
and
wrapped
it
round
his
feet
then
he
seated
himself
upon
the
temple
steps
and
pillowing
the
head
gently
in
his
lap
he
began
massaging
with
his
forehead
and
skull
in
the
manner
which
he
had
practised
from
childhood
which
only
he
in
the
world
understood
but
the
swoon
continued
now
and
then
a
slight
convulsion
ran
through
ulrich
frame
like
a
shiver
from
cold
if
i
could
get
him
warm
he
would
recover
consciousness
thought
leo
and
drew
the
folds
of
the
cloak
closer
round
his
limbs
the
flakes
descended
with
monotonous
speed
without
a
hiatus
or
a
pause
not
the
tiniest
spot
did
they
spare
and
the
narrow
roof
of
the
temple
was
no
shelter
from
them
they
no
longer
cooled
and
refreshed
but
stung
and
burned
as
they
fell
on
his
skin
they
settled
in
scores
on
his
thin
and
made
little
dark
rivulets
there
as
their
shapes
melted
he
began
to
freeze
but
he
did
not
mind
his
whole
soul
was
centred
on
the
of
which
ulrich
face
now
held
out
one
signal
after
another
and
at
length
his
eyes
opened
first
his
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
distance
then
it
wandered
along
the
white
sleeves
which
bellied
above
him
and
finally
remained
riveted
on
the
face
bending
over
him
with
such
keen
solicitude
an
expression
of
intense
horror
slowly
dawned
on
his
features
a
shudder
ran
through
his
limbs
and
he
made
a
spasmodic
attempt
to
stand
on
his
legs
but
sank
back
again
exhausted
his
breast
heaved
and
his
hands
fumbled
for
a
support
leo
felt
his
own
breath
come
faster
now
was
his
great
opportunity
spare
yourself
he
stammered
i
implore
you
i
will
do
nothing
to
you
lie
still
and
let
me
explain
everything
only
lie
still
afterwards
when
you
have
regained
strength
you
shall
shoot
me
down
but
so
long
as
you
are
feeling
poorly
spare
yourself
and
lie
still
for
pity
sake
ulrich
gestures
became
more
composed
and
there
was
a
silence
leo
greedily
leo
heard
his
name
fall
from
the
beloved
lips
what
old
man
what
leo
why
have
you
not
got
on
your
coat
oh
never
mind
my
coat
leo
if
you
leo
why
do
ask
any
questions
child
not
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
all
but
not
now
now
you
must
lie
quietly
here
while
i
go
for
help
no
no
it
is
best
that
you
should
say
now
once
for
all
what
you
want
to
say
but
are
you
quite
sure
that
you
are
well
enough
to
bear
it
yes
i
think
so
and
you
will
be
able
to
understand
yes
i
shall
understand
i
have
spoken
ulrich
because
i
thought
it
no
good
because
i
thought
you
would
believe
her
and
not
me
and
because
i
wanted
to
spare
her
too
but
whether
you
will
believe
me
or
not
whether
or
not
it
is
her
ruin
i
will
speak
now
and
i
shall
not
whitewash
myself
you
may
be
sure
of
that
and
then
he
confessed
all
beginning
with
the
first
great
lie
which
had
been
the
root
of
all
the
evil
he
kept
back
nothing
and
softened
nothing
in
the
rapid
brief
words
which
the
stress
of
the
moment
necessitated
his
using
it
was
as
if
his
heart
opened
and
his
soul
poured
out
through
his
veins
in
streams
of
blood
silent
and
motionless
with
his
eyes
raised
to
the
ceiling
of
the
temple
ulrich
listened
then
he
seemed
to
be
losing
consciousness
again
for
he
became
wandering
and
unintelligible
in
his
speech
and
his
eyelids
dropped
but
he
had
clearly
comprehended
as
far
as
the
intended
double
suicide
and
he
had
grasped
its
deepest
motive
for
with
a
mild
melancholy
smile
he
murmured
poor
boy
after
that
he
was
silent
and
lay
there
with
feverish
cheeks
and
dry
lips
gazing
into
vacancy
from
beneath
his
drooping
lids
ulrich
only
sign
of
forgiveness
was
in
those
two
words
poor
boy
and
to
these
leo
had
to
cling
desperately
now
and
later
in
many
an
hour
of
suspense
till
he
could
be
certain
what
fate
had
in
store
for
him
with
merciless
calm
the
flakes
whirled
down
there
was
a
cruel
and
restful
peace
in
their
endless
descent
a
sort
of
eternal
repose
like
a
silent
burying
of
countless
races
leo
shivered
his
shirt
was
wet
through
and
a
feeling
of
numbness
crept
over
his
stiff
arms
where
should
he
take
the
sick
man
uhlenfelde
was
nearest
but
he
recoiled
with
horror
from
the
idea
of
delivering
him
into
the
woman
hands
again
he
had
him
and
he
would
keep
him
in
defiance
of
her
and
the
whole
world
a
warm
glow
of
energy
suffused
his
limbs
he
laid
the
head
of
his
unconscious
friend
against
the
pedestal
and
sprang
to
his
feet
and
as
he
looked
round
him
into
the
white
dripping
duskiness
in
which
everything
seemed
indistinct
and
shapeless
the
knowledge
grew
on
him
you
live
and
you
may
live
he
put
both
hands
to
his
brow
and
staggered
above
the
prostrate
form
it
was
a
happiness
that
pained
and
then
he
ran
off
straight
to
halewitz
to
fetch
help
xl
a
time
of
heavy
trial
followed
ulrich
must
have
carried
the
germs
of
typhoid
about
with
him
since
he
left
his
stepson
and
the
excitement
of
that
memorable
night
had
developed
them
into
activity
he
lay
in
leo
study
hovering
between
life
and
death
in
the
first
hours
after
conveying
him
there
leo
half
feared
that
felicitas
might
dispute
his
right
to
nursing
the
patient
but
his
anxiety
on
this
account
proved
quite
superfluous
the
messenger
whom
he
had
despatched
to
uhlenfelde
brought
back
word
that
the
gnädiger
frau
had
driven
to
the
station
early
that
morning
with
luggage
and
had
left
no
address
behind
her
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
release
that
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
by
the
and
swore
over
his
friend
thin
burning
hand
a
thousand
oaths
to
which
he
could
not
give
words
but
which
all
meant
the
same
thing
see
i
am
my
old
self
again
and
so
i
shall
always
be
his
one
plan
for
the
future
now
was
to
live
with
him
if
he
lived
and
to
die
with
him
if
he
died
he
never
left
ulrich
bed
his
rest
was
taken
on
the
floor
at
its
foot
and
with
cognac
and
champagne
he
kept
at
bay
the
sleep
that
was
so
necessary
to
his
powerful
physique
which
he
would
not
allow
to
feel
the
strain
of
watching
he
had
been
morally
so
cast
down
and
broken
by
the
events
of
the
last
few
weeks
that
even
now
he
could
hardly
believe
in
reawakened
expectations
of
happiness
or
hopes
for
ulrich
recovery
except
by
a
miracle
an
extra
anxiety
was
added
to
his
burden
when
johanna
appeared
one
evening
at
the
door
of
the
and
declared
that
the
time
had
come
for
her
to
see
ulrich
god
had
directed
that
she
should
speak
with
him
before
he
died
leo
assurances
that
the
patient
would
not
be
able
to
recognise
or
understand
her
were
in
vain
and
as
in
desperation
he
tried
to
remove
her
from
the
corridor
by
force
she
began
to
rave
the
next
morning
at
her
own
express
wish
she
was
taken
to
an
asylum
in
these
days
of
trouble
and
sorrow
when
even
grandmamma
had
lost
her
old
nerve
and
presence
of
mind
and
ran
hither
and
thither
crying
and
wringing
her
hands
hertha
was
a
prop
to
lean
upon
and
an
indefatigable
helper
she
kept
the
household
going
in
its
customary
routine
and
carried
the
master
orders
to
the
steward
and
bailiffs
even
to
desolate
uhlenfelde
she
stretched
out
a
helping
hand
a
silent
understanding
had
come
about
between
her
and
leo
which
was
regarded
by
every
one
as
perfectly
natural
for
it
was
an
accepted
thing
that
they
belonged
to
each
other
when
he
met
the
glance
of
her
bright
eyes
hanging
questioningly
on
his
lips
he
thought
she
has
suffered
so
she
will
be
able
to
forgive
but
first
ulrich
recovery
and
the
rest
would
come
right
of
itself
the
recovery
came
in
the
middle
of
february
ulrich
awoke
to
new
consciousness
though
for
weeks
afterwards
he
was
too
weak
to
follow
any
consecutive
train
of
thought
he
seemed
to
have
lost
in
a
great
measure
his
grasp
on
the
past
and
he
was
as
grateful
as
a
child
when
he
was
helped
out
in
remembering
things
with
the
return
of
his
mental
powers
a
certain
restlessness
was
apparent
in
him
of
a
purely
physical
character
but
which
evidently
led
his
mind
back
to
the
contemplation
of
the
gaps
in
a
psychic
puzzle
he
appeared
anxious
to
ask
questions
to
probe
and
search
into
matters
but
not
having
the
courage
lapsed
into
prolonged
and
silent
brooding
leo
watched
the
process
with
growing
uneasiness
an
explanation
was
out
of
the
question
yet
every
day
it
became
more
and
more
imperative
early
in
march
the
doctor
after
a
private
talk
with
the
convalescent
urged
the
necessity
of
a
change
of
six
or
eight
weeks
to
a
southern
climate
he
also
insisted
that
it
was
most
important
that
this
change
should
precede
the
return
to
uhlenfelde
who
should
accompany
him
certainly
not
herr
von
sellenthin
such
a
thing
was
not
to
be
thought
of
the
poor
overtaxed
brain
must
rest
and
that
was
only
possible
with
strangers
friends
in
such
cases
were
poison
leo
said
no
more
the
next
day
a
young
doctor
without
a
practice
arrived
from
königsberg
who
was
delighted
to
undertake
the
case
and
travel
with
ulrich
which
as
he
freely
confessed
would
be
a
lift
to
him
financially
the
parting
between
the
friends
was
gentle
and
affectionate
and
on
the
surface
without
significance
in
it
there
was
on
one
side
the
dumb
appeal
forgive
me
and
on
the
other
the
unspoken
assurance
i
have
forgiven
you
week
after
week
went
by
leo
worked
with
almost
superhuman
zeal
for
now
the
supervision
of
the
uhlenfelde
estate
as
well
as
his
own
was
on
his
shoulders
he
thought
of
his
former
mistress
without
bitterness
or
though
he
was
sometimes
exercised
to
know
what
had
become
of
her
one
day
scanty
news
of
her
reached
him
in
an
unexpected
and
indirect
way
he
called
on
pastor
brenckenberg
with
the
object
of
asking
his
pardon
for
his
roughness
to
him
at
their
last
interview
and
then
the
old
man
who
had
gradually
got
over
his
rancour
told
him
that
his
son
the
rascal
had
met
the
baroness
von
kletzingk
in
berlin
she
had
looked
the
same
as
usual
had
not
been
in
the
least
embarrassed
and
had
overwhelmed
him
with
questions
and
there
something
else
to
tell
you
continued
the
pastor
you
really
did
my
boy
a
good
turn
after
all
it
is
true
that
he
has
been
expelled
from
his
corps
but
that
wo
do
him
much
harm
he
has
been
a
different
creature
since
that
correction
you
administered
to
him
he
has
given
up
loafing
and
getting
into
debt
and
he
is
now
earning
his
bread
and
working
steadily
for
his
exam
so
pardon
me
fritzchen
and
let
me
thank
you
i
behaved
like
an
old
ass
leo
shook
his
hand
laughingly
then
he
pondered
on
what
he
had
heard
about
felicitas
and
hoped
that
she
was
not
playing
the
adventuress
in
berlin
a
report
of
ulrich
came
every
week
at
first
the
young
doctor
wrote
and
then
he
wrote
himself
a
few
faint
hurried
lines
and
on
these
his
friend
was
obliged
to
build
his
hopes
slowly
leo
soul
was
purged
of
its
gnawing
suspicions
and
its
anxious
presentiments
of
evil
which
had
been
so
habitual
to
it
of
late
he
regained
his
and
at
the
same
time
spurts
of
the
quaint
cynicism
and
noisy
gaiety
which
so
well
become
those
doughty
giants
on
the
east
of
the
elbe
this
showed
that
his
wounds
were
healing
and
his
temperament
recovering
its
normal
healthiness
it
was
on
a
grey
still
morning
in
the
second
week
of
may
that
leo
came
in
ravenous
from
his
early
ride
to
join
the
others
at
breakfast
the
glass
doors
stood
wide
open
letting
in
draughts
of
the
soft
rainy
air
he
fancied
that
he
detected
in
the
three
pairs
of
eyes
raised
to
his
an
unwonted
flash
of
excitement
why
are
you
all
making
such
mysterious
faces
he
asked
his
mother
looked
away
and
smiled
elly
glanced
down
at
her
lap
and
smiled
too
hertha
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
has
face
with
complete
frankness
then
he
caught
sight
of
an
envelope
lying
beside
his
it
was
addressed
in
ulrich
handwriting
but
bore
no
postmark
his
heart
leapt
as
he
read
dear
old
boy
i
came
home
last
night
and
i
am
expecting
you
love
to
all
your
people
ulrich
because
he
did
not
wish
to
betray
his
emotion
he
stood
silently
behind
his
chair
and
crumpled
the
paper
in
his
hand
each
one
in
turn
came
up
to
him
quietly
and
congratulated
him
children
he
said
his
house
is
empty
and
desolate
now
he
has
no
one
but
us
help
me
to
make
him
welcome
here
so
that
he
may
look
on
it
as
his
home
will
you
help
me
all
three
of
you
of
course
we
will
my
son
said
his
mother
and
stroked
his
arm
and
do
you
agree
hertha
she
looked
at
him
with
wide
calm
eyes
and
nodded
he
took
her
hand
and
mutely
thanked
her
then
he
ate
and
drank
and
counted
the
minutes
soon
he
was
making
his
way
streamwards
over
paths
all
round
him
in
hedge
and
field
buds
and
shoots
were
bursting
forth
into
their
spring
glory
and
within
him
as
he
went
along
a
voice
kept
up
the
jubilant
cry
now
he
belongs
to
me
entirely
and
no
one
else
but
when
he
stood
aloft
on
the
dyke
and
saw
below
him
the
bijou
turrets
of
uhlenfelde
rising
in
their
coquettish
smartness
against
the
sky
a
fear
began
to
creep
into
his
heart
they
had
been
built
for
her
and
where
was
she
perhaps
knocking
about
the
world
abandoned
and
degraded
while
he
unpunished
might
dare
to
set
his
foot
in
the
house
which
he
had
helped
to
desecrate
but
what
of
that
he
laughed
and
stretched
his
strong
limbs
primed
like
steel
health
and
happiness
must
be
snatched
when
they
come
your
way
at
any
cost
what
good
to
cry
over
spilt
milk
and
he
struck
out
vigorously
with
the
oars
the
isle
of
friendship
in
its
may
raiment
of
pale
green
and
gold
seemed
to
peep
admiringly
at
its
own
reflection
in
the
water
that
saved
us
he
thought
and
in
passing
looked
out
for
a
glimpse
of
the
temple
which
the
foliage
was
not
yet
umbrageous
enough
to
hide
as
the
boat
crunched
on
the
uhlenfelde
strand
panic
seized
him
again
and
he
entered
the
courtyard
breathing
in
short
gasps
like
an
asthmatic
but
with
an
effort
he
set
his
teeth
and
collected
himself
ulrich
had
seen
him
coming
and
was
in
the
hall
to
receive
him
the
subdued
light
of
a
cloudy
day
fell
on
his
serious
rigid
face
which
the
spring
sunshine
of
the
south
had
toned
to
a
yellowish
brown
leo
was
conscious
that
he
trembled
he
would
have
liked
to
fly
into
his
arms
only
he
did
not
dare
the
immovable
face
held
him
back
instead
he
stretched
out
both
his
hands
and
murmured
a
conventional
how
are
you
a
gleam
of
melancholy
tenderness
passed
over
ulrich
features
my
boy
he
said
biting
his
lips
my
dear
old
boy
and
then
he
led
him
into
the
garden
salon
where
a
solitary
stood
on
a
side
table
leo
cast
a
shy
glance
to
the
left
in
the
direction
of
lizzie
sanctum
the
door
into
the
boudoir
was
closed
and
the
key
gone
the
whole
house
seemed
void
and
deadly
quiet
as
if
it
contained
no
living
creature
except
the
master
in
a
corner
of
the
window
was
the
couch
with
an
armchair
drawn
up
close
to
it
and
a
little
table
with
and
that
was
where
felicitas
had
thrown
herself
down
that
autumn
afternoon
when
she
had
first
begun
to
stir
up
old
memories
leo
thought
of
this
and
felt
a
slight
repugnance
when
ulrich
asked
him
to
sit
down
there
the
room
from
floor
to
ceiling
seemed
haunted
with
shameful
pictures
of
what
had
been
the
winter
crops
are
thriving
began
ulrich
leo
hesitated
before
answering
in
this
very
natural
remark
of
a
landowner
who
has
returned
home
after
a
long
absence
he
traced
an
evasion
yes
they
are
all
right
he
said
constrained
and
you
have
looked
after
uhlenfelde
interests
accept
my
warmest
thanks
old
boy
do
mention
it
replied
leo
refusing
the
hand
held
out
to
him
your
are
used
to
managing
for
themselves
certainly
that
true
said
ulrich
but
nevertheless
it
is
well
that
they
should
feel
the
hand
of
a
master
over
them
i
wonder
what
he
means
thought
leo
still
at
a
loss
and
perplexed
by
the
immovable
solemn
face
opposite
him
their
friendship
their
old
exuberant
grand
friendship
what
had
become
of
it
a
dim
desire
awoke
in
leo
to
play
the
fool
to
put
an
end
to
this
constraint
he
felt
as
if
he
could
stand
on
his
head
dance
and
whoop
or
throw
himself
at
his
feet
kiss
his
hands
and
cry
forgive
forgive
yet
all
forgiven
in
this
man
calm
composed
glance
there
was
not
a
shadow
of
reproach
nothing
but
an
affectionate
compassion
tell
me
about
yourself
uhich
he
asked
stuttering
are
you
satisfied
with
your
progress
do
you
feel
quite
well
now
yes
said
ulrich
i
am
very
well
there
was
a
pause
outside
the
rain
fell
in
warm
soft
torrents
and
the
soil
greedily
absorbed
the
moisture
strings
of
grey
pearls
hung
on
the
young
green
of
the
twigs
and
the
leaves
expanded
and
glistened
in
the
invigorating
everywhere
young
life
and
the
promise
of
a
fertile
spring
but
the
two
men
who
loved
each
other
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
felt
as
if
a
breath
of
autumn
and
dying
things
hovered
about
them
you
know
ulrich
began
we
have
much
to
talk
over
old
boy
we
must
come
to
a
clear
understanding
about
our
position
with
regard
to
each
other
i
mean
our
old
friendship
a
quiet
iron
resolve
made
his
face
like
an
inscrutable
mask
it
was
as
if
this
sickly
soul
had
fought
its
last
struggles
and
come
off
victor
something
of
ulrich
calm
was
at
this
minute
communicated
to
leo
he
felt
that
happen
what
might
it
would
be
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
their
two
inmost
natures
it
is
well
that
we
have
allowed
so
much
time
to
elapse
since
that
night
ulrich
went
on
i
have
been
able
to
think
over
things
and
i
believe
that
i
have
chosen
the
right
path
for
us
to
pursue
the
sad
story
you
related
to
me
on
the
isle
of
friendship
has
since
been
corroborated
in
every
particular
by
felicitas
herself
leo
started
up
you
have
seen
her
he
stammered
ulrich
nodded
gravely
she
wrote
to
me
about
about
the
divorce
as
you
may
suppose
and
so
i
went
to
look
her
up
i
did
not
like
the
idea
of
leaving
the
poor
thing
to
her
own
devices
in
case
she
should
go
altogether
to
the
bad
leo
could
not
help
feeling
a
jealous
pang
ulrich
spoke
of
the
woman
so
gently
would
he
deal
as
tenderly
with
him
but
when
i
found
her
looking
fresh
and
gay
as
if
relieved
of
a
burden
you
really
found
her
like
leo
asked
eagerly
ulrich
bowed
his
head
and
an
ironical
smile
played
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
then
i
saw
plainly
how
much
i
had
been
to
blame
i
ought
never
to
have
offered
my
hand
to
a
healthy
young
creature
made
in
every
fibre
for
love
and
pleasure
i
a
fragile
unsound
subject
hardly
capable
of
dragging
through
life
alone
i
hope
that
she
will
be
happy
now
i
do
not
love
her
i
ceased
to
care
for
her
the
day
i
knew
but
we
speak
of
the
boy
still
no
one
shall
cast
a
stone
at
her
leo
breathed
more
freely
ulrich
evidently
did
not
regret
her
and
this
shadow
no
longer
lay
between
them
to
pass
on
to
ourselves
said
ulrich
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
a
gesture
denoting
mental
fatigue
his
features
lost
their
expression
of
strained
severity
and
as
his
mouth
opened
two
lines
of
pain
shot
up
into
his
sunken
cheeks
another
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
leo
thought
whose
hopes
of
a
happy
issue
were
now
high
again
and
then
we
shall
be
on
quite
the
old
footing
do
you
remember
my
dear
boy
ulrich
went
on
with
his
eyes
fixed
distressfully
on
vacancy
the
day
of
your
return
when
we
sat
and
drank
together
at
the
prussian
crown
you
said
to
me
then
that
my
marriage
would
cost
us
our
friendship
i
would
believe
you
at
the
time
but
now
i
see
that
you
were
a
thousand
times
right
how
do
you
mean
right
stammered
leo
feeling
a
cold
shiver
of
anxiety
run
through
him
you
must
reproach
me
dear
boy
i
am
punishing
myself
more
than
i
punish
you
i
love
you
as
much
as
ever
i
did
i
would
pour
out
my
heart
blood
for
you
but
i
ca
associate
with
you
any
more
ulrich
cried
leo
then
you
have
forgiven
me
after
all
ulrich
looked
pained
what
do
you
call
forgiving
he
said
the
one
woman
in
the
world
whom
i
as
your
friend
had
no
right
to
touch
i
made
my
wife
so
i
think
we
are
quits
if
it
had
come
to
shooting
between
us
that
day
and
you
had
sent
me
the
same
way
as
her
first
husband
i
would
have
died
stroking
and
blessing
your
hand
dear
boy
and
then
you
talk
of
forgiving
leo
had
staggered
to
his
feet
he
stretched
out
his
hand
as
if
he
would
seize
and
hold
his
friend
fast
before
his
soul
slipped
out
of
his
grasp
for
ever
what
you
propose
is
madness
he
exclaimed
no
dear
boy
i
should
like
to
explain
it
all
thoroughly
to
you
i
have
rehearsed
a
long
speech
but
i
can
not
somehow
exactly
recall
it
now
god
knows
it
was
my
firm
intention
to
let
the
past
lie
buried
but
i
ca
alter
my
nature
and
you
know
how
i
take
things
to
heart
and
when
i
do
must
speak
of
them
but
leaving
me
out
of
the
question
you
take
life
differently
less
seriously
yet
how
could
you
endure
to
come
in
and
out
here
when
the
very
walls
speak
to
you
of
the
past
i
noticed
just
now
how
you
glanced
at
that
door
it
seemed
to
you
that
she
must
be
coming
through
it
i
have
done
with
her
and
so
it
is
to
be
hoped
have
you
but
all
the
same
her
ghost
fills
this
place
and
you
feel
it
as
much
as
i
do
with
time
that
would
wear
off
leo
murmured
becoming
more
and
more
dispirited
i
doubt
it
replied
ulrich
it
could
never
wear
off
with
us
we
should
have
had
to
be
brought
up
differently
born
of
different
parents
and
with
other
blood
pumped
into
our
veins
as
we
are
our
sense
of
honour
our
manliness
would
constantly
be
in
revolt
day
by
day
we
should
become
more
discomfited
till
at
last
we
should
end
by
laying
at
each
other
door
our
loss
of
no
that
shall
not
be
it
would
be
too
great
a
strain
on
our
old
friendship
think
of
our
two
fathers
they
were
fond
of
each
other
god
knows
but
if
what
has
happened
to
us
had
happened
to
them
they
would
have
both
cut
their
throats
without
asking
who
was
to
blame
and
who
was
say
am
i
not
right
leo
was
silent
and
thought
to
himself
thus
he
casts
me
off
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
the
new
purpose
and
strength
that
he
had
built
up
within
him
all
the
tenderness
and
truth
were
falling
in
ruins
nothingness
stretched
before
him
the
best
thing
i
can
do
then
he
said
sadly
is
to
pack
my
bundle
as
quickly
as
may
be
and
go
back
to
america
ulrich
came
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
no
you
wo
do
that
dear
boy
he
said
look
over
there
across
the
stream
there
lie
your
acres
your
fields
full
of
flourishing
rye
the
turnips
waiting
to
be
transplanted
even
the
wheat
springing
above
the
soil
and
now
blessed
gift
of
rain
has
come
to
make
all
green
and
fruitful
you
are
responsible
for
every
tiny
growth
so
do
talk
of
running
away
to
waste
and
rot
where
you
can
do
no
good
and
reap
no
harvest
if
you
give
me
up
said
leo
bitterly
nothing
is
any
good
but
i
am
not
going
to
give
you
up
i
shall
watch
over
you
and
yours
from
afar
and
rejoice
in
all
that
gives
you
joy
i
shall
count
the
ears
of
corn
in
your
fields
and
your
children
i
will
cherish
in
my
heart
as
if
they
were
my
own
my
children
muttered
leo
ulrich
smiled
do
you
imagine
i
have
kept
my
eyes
open
he
asked
i
do
know
whether
you
feel
yet
that
you
have
come
through
the
furnace
of
what
has
been
sufficiently
cleansed
but
take
my
advice
and
do
keep
the
dear
girl
waiting
too
long
be
happy
you
have
good
cause
for
it
is
spring
inside
and
out
leo
felt
tears
start
to
his
eyes
he
turned
away
and
put
his
hands
over
his
face
and
what
about
you
ulrich
he
asked
controlling
his
emotion
a
gleam
of
patient
hopelessness
shot
over
the
tired
sallow
face
like
the
presage
of
a
tranquil
death
oh
i
he
said
i
have
not
much
more
to
live
for
you
must
worry
about
me
i
have
done
what
i
could
and
i
accept
as
a
special
grace
what
is
left
to
me
now
give
me
your
hand
my
most
earnest
heartfelt
thanks
are
yours
for
a
moment
they
lay
in
each
arms
be
brave
old
fellow
urged
ulrich
after
all
we
have
only
reached
the
point
at
which
we
stood
the
day
you
came
home
once
more
forgive
me
leo
half
whispered
as
if
ashamed
of
the
request
and
then
he
rushed
to
the
door
the
soft
rain
was
still
falling
a
warm
wind
swept
it
over
the
landscape
in
silvery
showers
and
from
between
the
banks
of
cloud
a
faint
golden
light
shone
down
on
the
fragrant
earth
wild
ducks
quacked
as
they
wallowed
in
the
slime
of
the
pond
in
the
branches
of
the
blossoming
hawthorns
finches
and
tomtits
chased
each
other
singing
and
chirruping
the
whole
of
nature
seemed
in
the
humour
for
jesting
as
if
coming
from
an
open
grave
leo
faced
life
again
in
its
changed
aspect
and
his
heart
was
very
sore
there
dawned
on
his
mind
a
sense
of
the
utter
uselessness
of
struggling
against
the
fate
which
governed
so
inexorably
the
human
race
his
brain
was
too
tired
to
reason
it
out
clearly
but
the
bare
idea
overawed
him
then
something
began
to
rise
up
in
revolt
within
him
against
the
destiny
to
which
he
had
submitted
without
even
a
show
of
resistance
and
against
the
prolonging
of
the
paralysing
influence
of
his
old
sin
the
sacrifice
to
which
he
had
consented
with
such
weak
humility
would
hang
that
sin
round
his
neck
like
a
millstone
for
evermore
there
was
his
boat
receiving
for
the
last
time
the
hospitality
of
the
white
sands
of
uhlenfelde
for
the
last
time
his
strong
arms
pushed
it
out
into
the
stream
the
last
time
the
pebbles
crunched
under
the
grinding
keel
and
its
nose
ploughed
gaily
into
the
sparkling
ripples
was
it
really
the
last
time
that
his
foot
would
touch
uhlenfelde
soil
half
hesitating
he
jumped
into
the
boat
and
fixed
the
oars
with
an
exclamation
of
anger
what
he
had
agreed
to
was
absurd
nay
worse
it
was
a
positive
crime
a
crime
against
himself
and
against
his
friend
and
then
when
in
he
turned
to
take
a
farewell
look
at
uhlenfelde
he
saw
at
one
of
the
turret
windows
ulrich
face
it
was
unmistakable
framed
in
its
light
scanty
goat
beard
and
with
its
great
hollow
eyes
his
heart
leapt
it
would
seem
as
if
ulrich
had
mounted
to
the
tower
with
the
purpose
of
beaconing
him
back
i
coming
i
coming
he
cried
jubilantly
and
with
a
frantic
pull
began
to
turn
the
boat
round
but
no
ulrich
made
no
sign
on
the
contrary
he
drew
back
quickly
as
if
he
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
disappointed
leo
rowed
on
yet
he
felt
distinctly
happier
at
the
sight
of
his
friend
in
his
great
shy
compassionate
love
watching
him
half
hidden
by
the
curtains
there
came
back
to
leo
in
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
all
his
strength
and
energy
which
he
had
felt
recently
thrilling
through
body
and
soul
the
old
glorious
mighty
unquenchable
confidence
in
conquest
which
had
been
his
inheritance
and
had
ruled
his
life
from
the
beginning
till
a
woman
had
shamefully
filched
it
from
him
he
jerked
the
oars
out
of
his
hands
drew
himself
erect
and
stretching
his
clenched
fists
towards
ulrich
he
called
out
laughingly
across
the
water
i
win
you
back
yet
see
if
i
do
the
glimmer
of
a
face
vanished
from
the
window
opposite
but
leo
sat
down
in
the
boat
again
and
guided
it
swiftly
to
the
halewitz
shore

festival

his
heart

regina
or
the
sins
of
the
fathers
by
hermann
sudermann
translated
by
beatrice
marshall
crown
price
sudermann
is
one
of
the
most
masterly
of
contemporary
novelists
and
it
was
high
time
that
he
should
be
presented
to
the
english
public
katzensteg
though
far
from
the
latest
is
perhaps
the
most
powerful
of
his
novels
and
the
publisher
has
been
well
advised
in
selecting
it
as
for
the
translation
it
is
so
admirably
done
that
as
we
read
we
forget
we
are
reading
a
translation
to
beatrice
marshall
we
owe
a
skilful
and
spirited
translation
of
hermann
sudermann
great
novel
the
story
palpitates
with
the
passion
of
patriotism
of
revenge
of
love
and
hate
the
book
is
a
strong
book
and
not
written
for
babes
it
gives
us
an
insight
into
the
patriotic
passion
that
drives
men
to
commit
actions
as
savage
and
ignoble
as
it
inspires
them
to
the
highest
heroism
the
appeal
of
the
book
lies
in
the
development
of
that
wonderful
between
the
two
unhappy
outcasts
weighted
with
the
sins
of
the
father
to
those
who
can
not
read
the
story
in
german
we
recommend
this
translation
of
a
masterpiece
belongs
to
that
category
in
which
great
novels
rank
a
powerful
and
very
deliberate
tragedy
miss
beatrice
marshall
is
the
translator
and
on
the
whole
herr
sudermann
may
consider
himself
fortunate
after
a
perusal
of
we
are
constrained
to
wonder
why
in
the
name
of
fortune
a
book
so
powerful
has
had
to
wait
such
a
long
time
for
a
translator
is
not
a
book
belonging
to
any
school
it
is
the
product
of
a
mind
strong
enough
to
reject
all
neighbourly
props
and
it
could
only
have
been
written
by
a
realist
who
has
not
been
unwise
enough
to
depart
altogether
from
the
poetry
of
romance
the
author
has
handled
his
terrible
theme
with
wonderful
force
and
simplicity
and
a
complete
avoidance
of
offence
regina
is
a
strangely
pathetic
and
even
heroic
figure
while
there
is
an
elemental
force
in
the
passions
hate
love
avarice
and
cruelty
of
the
various
which
lend
them
an
impressiveness
rarely
encountered
in
a
novel
of
english
life
it
is
little
to
the
credit
of
our
publishers
that
this
masterpiece
which
in
germany
has
reached
a
edition
should
have
waited
nine
years
for
an
english
translator
this
translation
will
reveal
what
artistic
realism
may
become
miss
marshall
is
particularly
happy
in
the
rural
and
domestic
scenes
james
a
striking
bit
of
work
full
of
excitements
and
strongly
drawn
characters
miss
beatrice
marshall
the
translator
is
to
be
congratulated
on
an
excellent
piece
of
work
the
story
is
told
with
remarkable
skill
the
interest
being
sustained
throughout
the
novel
is
a
striking
one
and
deserves
careful
and
critical
attention
mall
a
great
german
novel
the
tale
is
at
a
tense
pitch
of
excitement
and
agitation
and
it
abounds
with
wonderful
strongly
drawn
characters
there
is
nothing
gladdening
at
all
but
power
beats
in
every
stroke
and
the
æschylean
gloom
and
force
of
the
story
is
nothing
short
of
grand
to
miss
marshall
they
the
readers
owe
gratitude
for
introduction
to
a
book
of
exceptional
force
through
a
very
creditable
translation
it
is
quite
impossible
to
do
justice
to
the
literary
and
artistic
merits
of
this
great
and
original
achievement
in

a
