preface
the
following
work
is
a
narration
of
facts
my
only
desire
is
to
give
a
clear
and
connected
record
of
what
will
ever
be
regarded
as
a
most
remarkable
episode
in
the
history
of
the
great
rebellion
the
style
of
the
book
demands
an
apology
it
was
begun
in
sickness
induced
by
the
privations
of
rebel
prisons
and
completed
amidst
the
fatigue
and
excitement
of
the
most
glorious
campaign
which
has
yet
crowned
our
arms
under
these
circumstances
there
must
be
many
faults
of
expression
which
a
generous
reader
will
readily
pardon
to
the
many
kind
friends
who
sympathized
with
me
during
the
weary
interval
when
my
fate
was
considered
hopeless
as
well
as
those
who
rejoiced
with
me
on
my
return
i
can
only
tender
my
most
sincere
thanks
myself
and
comrades
are
greatly
indebted
to
the
president
and
secretary
stanton
for
their
generous
recognition
of
our
services
and
the
munificent
rewards
bestowed
upon
us
to
them
and
to
judge
holt
hitchcock
and
james
wetmore
ohio
state
military
agent
we
take
this
opportunity
of
expressing
our
heartfelt
obligations
another
to
whom
i
am
indebted
is
trall
of
new
york
at
his
beautiful

the
mountain
side
near
wernersville
berks
county
pennsylvania
i
regained
my
lost
health
for
his
kindness
and
that
of
his
skillful
assistants
drs
glass
and
fairchild
i
will
ever
be
deeply
grateful
it
was
with
regret
woven
with
many
pleasant
memories
that
i
left
their
hospitable
home
when
recovered
health
and
duty
called
me
again
to
the
field
to
my
early
friend
rev
alexander
clark
editor
of
the
i
am
still
more
deeply
indebted
his
literary
experience
was
freely
placed
at
my
service
and
when
discouraged
in
the
preparation
of
my
story
which
was
to
me
an
arduous
undertaking
his
words
of
hope
and
cheer
stimulated
me
to
renewed
efforts
but
for
aid
derived
from
his
sympathy
and
advice
i
would
have
probably
abandoned
my
task
may
he
be
fully
rewarded
there
are
a
host
of
others
whose
good
offices
will
always
be
kindly
remembered
among
them
are

as

personal
adventures
recorded
on
the
page
of
history
william
pittenger
the
oldest
of
a
numerous
family
was
born
in
jefferson
county
ohio
january
his
father
thomas
pittenger
is
a
farmer
and
trains
his
children
in
the
solid
experiences
of
manual
labor
his
mother
is
from
a
thinking
familyhood
of
people
many
of
whom
are
well
known
in
eastern
ohio
as
pioneers
in
social
and
moral
progress
the
mills
william
learned
to
love
his
country
about
as
early
as
he
learned
to
love
his
own
mother
for
his
first
lessons
were
loyalty
and
liberty
syllabled
by
a
mother
lips
even
before
the
boy
could
read
he
knew
in
outline
the
history
of
our
nation
trials
and
triumphs
from
the
days
of
bunker
hill
forward
to
the
passing
events
of
the
latest
newspaper
chronicling
all
of
which
facts
were
nightly
canvassed
around
the
although
he
was
an
adept
in
all
branches
of
learning
yet
in
school
days
as
now
young
pittenger
had
two
favorite
studies
and
they
happened
to
be
the
very
ones
in
the
prosecution
of
which
his
teachers
could
aid
him
scarcely
at
all
history
and
astronomy
but
in
the
face
of
discouragement
with
the
aid
only
of
accidental
helps
and
by
the
and
the
after
the
sunny
hours
had
been
toiled
away
he
pressed
patiently
and
perseveringly
forward
in
his
own
chosen
methods
until
he
became
an
accurate
historian
and
a
practical
astronomer
at
the
age
of
seventeen
he
manufactured
for
the
most
part
with
his
own
hands
a
reflecting
telescope
which
his
friends
came
from
near
and
far
to
see
and
gaze
through
at
the
wonderful
worlds
before
the
ambitions
of
were
not
sufficient
to
occupy
the
head
and
hands
of
this
searcher
for
knowledge
to
explore
the
fields
of
the
firmament
with
his
telescope
gave
him
intenser
pleasure
than
the
most
faithful
farmer
ever
realized
from
furrowing
his
fields
in
the
dewiest
spring
mornings
to
follow
the
footsteps
of
heroes
through
the
annals
as
they
struggled
up
through
conflicts
to
glorious
liberty
thrilled
him
with
a
livelier
enthusiasm
than
ever
sprang
from
the
music
of
marching
harvesters
while
other
young
men
of
his
age
and
neighborhood
idled
their
rainy
days
and
winter
nights
in
trifling
diversions
there
was
one
who
preferred
the
higher
joy
of
communion
with
humboldt
in
his
cosmos
macaulay
in
his
england
irving
in
his
columbus
or
burritt
in
his
geography
of
the
heavens
owing
to
this
decided
preference
for
science
and
literature
the
father
found
it
advisable
to
indulge
his
son
in
the
desire
to
enter
a
field
more
consonant
with
his
wishes
he
accordingly
qualified
himself
by
close
study
at
home
and
without
a
tutor
for
the
profession
of
teaching
in
this
honorable
avocation
he
labored
with
industry
and
promise
until
he
felt
constrained
by
love
of
country
to
quit
the
desk
and
the
children
for
the
tent
and
the
hosts
of
armëd
men
during
his
career
as
teacher
he
was
for
awhile
associated
with
the
writer
in
the
publication
of
the
then
issued
at
cleveland
ohio
the
enterprise
was
at
that
time
to
the
great
outer
world
an
unnoticed
and
insignificant
one
yet
to
those
whose
little
all
was
enlisted
in
the
mission
of
a
day
school
paper
it
was
indeed
something
that
lay
close
upon
their
hearts
that
was
a
cheerless
friendless
time
in
the
history
of
the
little
to
at
least
two
inexperienced
adventurers
in
the
literary
world
but
these
were
hidden
trials
and
shall
be
unwritten
still
the
teachings
of
his
mother
together
with
the
unconscious
tuition
resulting
from
observation
and
experience
made
pittenger
an
early
and
constant
friend
of
freedom
any
mind
imbued
with
an
admiration
of
god
marches
in
the
heavens
as
an
omnipotent
creator
and
inspired
by
a
contemplation
of
god
finger
in
history
as
a
merciful
deliverer
will
rise
to
the
high
level
of
universal
love
to
man
and
will
comprehend
the
broad
equality
of
gospel
liberty
and
republican
brotherhood
let
a
man
be
educated
head
and
heart
and
he
will
love
freedom
and
demand
freedom
and
dare
and
suffer
for
freedom
not
for
himself
only
but
for
all
the
oppressed
of
the
whole
earth
reader
you
may
draw
lines
you
may
profess
a
conservative
christianity
that
would
theologize
the
very
grace
out
of
the
command
thy
neighbor
as
you
may
ignore
this
precept
and
adopt
something
more
fashionable
and
aristocratic
but
if
you
do
you
entertain
in
your
heart
treason
both
to
your
father
in
heaven
and
to
your
brother
on
earth
this
law
of
love
is
revealed
to
lowly
men
it
cuts
down
through
crowns
and
creeds
and
chains
and
rests
as
a
blessed
benediction
on
sufferers
and
slaves
this
is
the
inspiration
that
brings
victory
to
our
arms
and
deals
death
to
destroyers
this
was
the
spirit
that
prompted
our
young
hero
to
stand
forth
one
of
the
very
first
from
his
native
county
a
soldier
for
right
and
righteousness
the
moment
the
sumter
cry
rang
up
the
valley
of
his
ohio
home
when
pittinger
became
a
volunteer
it
was
for
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
with
all
its
belongings
and
if
its
overthrow
should
tumble
slavery
with
its
clanking
fetters
and
howling
hounds
to
the
uttermost
destruction
he
would
grasp
his
gun
the
firmer
for
the
hope
and
thank
god
for
the
prospect
the
test
and
the
toil
he
enlisted
as
a
soldier
for
his
country
ready
to
march
anywhere
strike
with
any
weapon
endure
any
fatigue
or
share
any
sorrow
he
went
out
not
merely
an
armored
warrior
to
ward
off
attacks
not
to
strike
off
obnoxious
but
to
lay
the
ax
at
the
root
of
the
tree
and
to
pierce
the
very
heart
of
the
monster
iniquity
in
three
days
after
the
receipt
of
the
startling
intelligence
that
the
stars
and
stripes
had
been
fired
upon
by
rebels
in
arms
pittenger
was
on
his
way
to
the
capital
as
a
private
soldier
in
the
second
ohio
regiment
of
volunteers
he
fought
bravely
on
the
disastrous
of
july
in
the
battle
of
bull
run
while
many
of
his
comrades
fell
bleeding
at
his
side
for
his
calm
heroic
conduct
throughout
that
memorable
day
of
peril
and
panic
he
received
the
highest
praise
from
every
officer
of
his
regiment
although
thus
a
sharer
of
sternest
conflicts
during
the
three
months
campaign
he
was
ready
to
immediately
when
his
country
called
for
a
longer
service
and
after
a
few
days
rest
beneath
the
old
homestead
roof
he
was
again
on
his
way
with
the
same
regiment
to
the
seat
of
war
in
the
southwest
during
the
fall
and
winter
he
saw
severe
service
on
the
dark
and
bloody
ground
no
soldiers
ever
endured
so
many
midnight
marches
more
patiently
or
manifested
more
devotion
to
country
through
rains
and
storms
and
wintry
desolations
than
the
noble
ohio
second
under
the
command
of
colonel
harris
through
the
campaign
in
the
mountains
of
eastern
kentucky
in
december
the
regiment
was
transferred
to
the
division
commanded
by
the
lamented
general
mitchel
then
encamped
at
louisville
from
this
point
the
army
pressed
forward
victoriously
through
elizabethtown
bowling
green
nashville
and
murfreesboro
until
the
old
banner
floated
in
the
tennessee
breezes
at
shelbyville
while
here
the
daring
expedition
to
penetrate
the
heart
of
the
confederacy
was
organized
of
which
party
pittenger
was
one
of
the
most
enthusiastic
and
determined
from
the
day
the
brave
fellows
departed
over
the
southern
hills
on
their
adventurous
journey
a
veil
was
dropped
which
hid
them
from
sight
of
friends
for
many
weary
months
and
some
of
them
for
ever
no
tidings
came
in
answer
to
all
the
beseeching
that
followed
their
mysterious
pathway
beyond
the
lines
vague
rumors
were
current
around
the
and
that
the
whole
party
had
been
executed
friends
began
to
despair
strangers
began
to
inquire
as
if
for
missing
friends
a
universal
sympathy
prevailed
in
their
behalf
and
whole
communities
were
excited
to
the
wildest
fervor
on
account
of
the
lost
adventurers
the
letters
from
the
steubenville
army
correspondent
were
missed
for
pittenger
wrote
no
more
the
family
were
in
an
agony
of
suspense
for
the
silent
absent
son
and
brother
his
ever
faithful
friend
chaplain
gaddis
of
the
ohio
second
made
an
effort
to
go
under
a
flag
of
truce
in
search
of
the
party
but
was
dissuaded
by
the
commanding
officers
from
so
hopeless
an
undertaking
the
summer
passed
and
yet
no
tidings
came
the
autumn
came
with
its
melancholy
and
uncertain
rumors
like
withered
fallen
leaves
were
again
afloat
about
the
camps
and
the
firesides
the
dreary
winter
came
and
still
the
hearts
of
the
most
hopeful
were
chilled
with
disappointment
the
father
began
to
think
of
william
as
dead
the
mother
to
talk
of
her
darling
as
one
who
had
lived
the
children
to
speak
of
their
elder
brother
as
one
they
should
never
see
any
more
until
all
the
lost
loved
ones
meet
in
the
better
land
the
writer
was
even
solicited
by
a
mutual
friend
to
preach
the
funeral
sermon
of
one
whose
memory
was
still
dear
but
whom
none
of
us
ever
hoped
to
see
again
on
earth
but
our
father
in
heaven
was
kinder
than
we
thought
our
prayers
had
been
heard
as
our
fervent
petitions
winged
up
from
family
altars
to
the
ear
of
the
infinite
lover
the
guardian
angels
winged
afar
downward
through
battle
alarms
and
ministered
to
him
for
whom
we
besought
protection
when
the
bright
spring
days
came
smiling
over
the
earth
a
message
came
from
the
hand
of
the
missing
one
brighter
and
sunnier
to
our
hearts
than
the
april
sunlight
on
the
hills
soon
the
story
was
told
and
we
all
thanked
god
for
the
merciful
deliverance
of
him
for
whom
we
prayed
and
who
had
found
even
in
a
dismal
the
pearl
of
great
price
the
one
we
loved
returned
home
a
witness
of
the
spirit
that
came
to
him
as
a
comforter
in
his
dreariest
loneliness
and
is
already
a
minister
of
the
precious
gospel
that
gladdened
him
in
the
time
of
his
tribulation
and
now
the
reader
shall
know
all
about
the
tedious
delay
and
the
long
silence
from
the
pen
of
him
who
survives
to
tell
the
story
we
commend
to
all
who
peruse
this
narrative

interesting

perplexities
the
writer
it
is
painful
for
me
to
write
the
adventures
of
the
last
year
as
i
compose
my
mind
to
the
task
there
arises
before
me
the
memory
of
days
of
suffering
and
nights
of
sleepless
apprehension
days
and
nights
that
in
their
black
monotony
seemed
well
nigh
eternal
and
the
sorrow
too
which
i
felt
on
that
terrible
day
when
my
companions
whom
common
dangers
and
common
sufferings
had
made
as
brothers
to
me
were
dragged
away
to
an
ignominious
death
that
i
expected
soon
to
share
all
comes
before
me
in
the
vividness
of
present
reality
and
i
almost
shrink
back
and
lay
down
the
pen
but
i
believe
it
to
be
a
duty
to
give
to
the
public
the
details
of
the
great
railroad
adventure
which
created
such
an
excitement
in
the
south
and
which
judge
holt
pronounced
to
be
the
most
romantic
episode
of
the
war
both
on
account
of
the
intrinsic
interest
involved
and
still
more
because
of
the
light
it
throws
on
the
manners
and
feelings
of
the
southern
people
and
their
conduct
during
the
rebellion
with
this
view
i
have
decided
to
give
a
detailed
history
of
the
expedition
its
failure
and
the
subsequent
imprisonment
and
fate
of
all
of
the
members
of
the
party
in
doing
this
i
will
have
the
aid
of
the
survivors
of
the
expedition
fourteen
in
all
and
hope
to
give
a
narrative
that
will
combine
the
strictest
truth
with
all
the
interest
of
a
romance
in
order
to
understand
why
the
destruction
of
the
georgia
state
railroad
was
of
so
much
consequence
i
will
refer
to
the
situation
of
affairs
in
the
southwest
in
the
opening
of
the
spring
of
the
year
commenced
very
auspiciously
for
our
arms
fort
donelson
had
fallen
after
a
desperate
contest
and
nearly
all
its
garrison
were
taken
prisoners
the
scattered
remains
of
the
rebel
army
under
johnston
had
retreated
precipitately
from
kentucky
which
had
indeed
been
to
them
the
dark
and
bloody
ground
columbus
and
nashville
were
evacuated
and
fell
into
our
hands
island
no
was
invested
and
the
tennessee
river
groaned
beneath
a
mighty
army
afloat
the
same
that
had
conquered
donelson
under
its
popular
leader
general
grant
and
which
it
was
fondly
hoped
would
strike
far
away
into
the
center
of
the
rebel
states
throughout
the
north
men
talked
of
the
war
as
done
and
speculated
as
to
the
terms
of
a
peace
that
was
soon
to
come
but
the
end
was
not
yet
the
rebel
leaders
who
had
embarked
their
all
in
this
cause
and
had
pictured
to
themselves
a
magnificent
slaveholding
empire
stretching
away
from
the
potomac
to
the
sierra
madre
in
mexico
and
swallowing
up
all
tropical
america
in
one
mighty
nation
devoted
to
the
interests
of
cotton
and
slavery
alone
over
which
they
should
reign
were
not
yet
satisfied
to
relinquish
their
cause
as
desperate
and
abandon
their
glorious
dreams
with
a
wonderful
energy
that
must
command
our
admiration
though
it
be
only
of
the
kind
that
is
accorded
to
satan
as
pictured
in
paradise
lost
they
passed
the
conscription
law
abandoned
the
posts
they
still
held
on
the
frontier
and
concentrated
their
forces
on
a
shorter
line
of
defence
the
eastern
part
of
this
line
extended
from
richmond
through
lynchburg
to
east
tennessee
in
the
west
it
was
represented
by
the
memphis
and
charleston
railroad
extending
from
memphis
through
corinth
huntsville
chattanooga
and
atlanta
to
charleston
here
they
poured
forward
their
new
levies
and
began
to
prepare
for
another
desperate
contest
the
unaccountable
inertness
of
the
eastern
army
of
the
union
under
mcclellan
gave
them
time
to
strengthen
their
defences
and
reinforce
their
army
which
had
dwindled
to
a
very
low
ebb
during
the
winter
but
while
the
commander
of
the
east
was
planning
strategy
that
by
the
slowness
of
its
development
if
by
nothing
was
destined
to
dim
the
lustre
of
the
union
triumphs
and
lose
the
results
of
a
year
of
war
the
west
was
in
motion
down
the
mississippi
swept
our
invincible
fleet
with
an
army
on
shore
to
second
its
operations
up
the
tennessee
steamed
grant
victorious
army
and
buell
with
forty
thousand
men
was
marching
across
the
state
of
tennessee
to
reach
the
same
point
my
own
division
under
the
lamented
general
mitchel
was
also
marching
across
the
state
but
in
a
different
direction
having
chattanooga
as
its
ultimate
aim
while
morgan
with
another
strong
force
many
of
whom
were
refugees
from
east
tennessee
lay
before
cumberland
gap
ready
to
strike
through
that
fastness
to
knoxville
and
thus
reach
the
very
heart
of
rebellion
to
meet
these
powerful
forces
whose
destination
he
could
not
altogether
foresee
beauregard
who
commanded
in
the
west
concentrated
his
main
army
at
corinth
with
smaller
detachments
scattered
along
the
railroad
to
chattanooga
the
railroads
on
which
he
relied
for
supplies
and
reinforcements
as
well
as
for
communication
with
the
eastern
portion
of
rebeldom
formed
an
irregular
parallelogram
of
which
the
northern
side
extended
from
memphis
to
chattanooga
the
eastern
from
chattanooga
to
atlanta
the
southern
from
atlanta
to
jackson
mississippi
and
the
western
by
a
network
of
roads
from
jackson
to
memphis
the
great
east
tennessee
and
virginia
railroad
which
has
not
inaptly
been
called
the
backbone
of
the
rebellion
intersected
this
parallelogram
at
chattanooga
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
to
destroy
the
northern
and
eastern
sides
of
this
parallelogram
isolated
beauregard
and
left
east
tennessee
which
was
then
almost
stripped
of
troops
to
fall
easily
before
general
morgan
so
important
was
this
destruction
of
communication
deemed
by
those
in
power
that
it
was
at
first
intended
to
reach
both
sides
and
destroy
them
by
armies
but
the
distance
was
so
great
that
the
design
of
destroying
it
in
this
manner
was
abandoned
however
just
at
this
time
andrews
who
was
a
secret
agent
of
the
united
states
and
had
repeatedly
visited
every
part
of
the
south
proposed
another
method
of
accomplishing
the
same
object
by
means
of
a
military
expedition
to
burn
the
bridges
on
the
road
and
thus
interrupt
communication
long
enough
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
schemes
which
were
expected
to
give
rebellion
in
the
southwest
its
he
first
made
the
proposition
to
general
buell
who
did
not
for
some
reason
approve
of
it
afterwards
he
repeated
it
to
general
mitchel
who
received
it
with
more
favor
our
division
was
at
this
time
lying
at
murfreesboro
repairing
some
bridges
that
had
been
destroyed
preparatory
to
an
onward
march
further
into
the
interior
all
at
once
eight
men
were
detailed
from
our
regiment
four
of
them
from
my
own
company
no
one
knew
anything
of
their
object
or
destination
and
numberless
were
the
conjectures
that
were
afloat
concerning
them
some
supposed
they
had
gone
home
to
arrest
deserters
others
that
they
were
deserters
themselves
but
this
last
idea
was
contradicted
by
the
fact
that
they
were
seen
in
close
and
apparently
confidential
communication
with
the
officers
just
before
their
departure
as
well
as
by
the
character
of
the
men
themselves
who
were
among
the
boldest
and
bravest
of
the
regiment
many
supposed
that
they
were
sent
into
the
enemy
country
as
spies
but
the
idea
of
sending
such
a
number
of
spies
from
the
privates
in
the
ranks
was
so
obviously
absurd
that
i
did
not
seriously
consider
it
however
i
was
not
long
to
remain
in
uncertainty
for
an
officer
who
was
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
revealed
the
secret
to
me
the
enterprise
was
so
grand
and
so
audacious
that
it
instantly
charmed
my
imagination
and
i
at
once
went
to
colonel
harris
of
the
second
ohio
and
asked
as
a
favor
from
him
that
if
any
detail
was
made
for
another
expedition
of
the
same
kind
i
should
be
placed
on
it
soon
after
one
of
the
party
from
company
c
returned
and
reported
that
he
had
ventured
as
far
as
chattanooga
and
there
had
met
a
confederate
soldier
who
recognized
him
as
belonging
to
the
union
army
and
while
for
the
sake
of
old
friendship
he
hesitated
to
denounce
him
to
the
authorities
yet
advised
him
to
return
which
he
immediately
did
and
arrived
safely
in
camp
in
a
few
days
he
would
give
no
details
that
might
embarrass
his
companions
who
were
still
pressing
their
way
onward
into
the
confederacy
a
short
time
after
this
all
the
party
came
back
and
i
received
full
details
of
their
trip
to
the
center
of
rebeldom
they
had
proceeded
in
citizens
dress
on
foot
and
unsuspected
to
chattanooga
there
had
taken
the
cars
for
atlanta
where
they
arrived
in
safety
here
they
expected
to
meet
a
georgia
engineer
who
had
been
running
on
the
state
road
for
some
time
and
with
his
assistance
intended
to
seize
the
passenger
train
at
breakfast
and
run
through
to
our
lines
burning
all
the
bridges
in
their
rear
for
several
days
they
waited
for
him
but
he
came
not
they
afterwards
learned
that
he
had
been
pressed
to
run
troops
to
beauregard
who
was
then
concentrating
every
available
man
at
corinth
in
anticipation
of
the
great
battle
which
afterwards
took
place
thus
foiled
and
having
no
man
among
them
capable
of
running
an
engine
they
abandoned
the
enterprise
for
that
time
and
quietly
stole
back
to
our
lines
had
an
engineer
then
been
along
they
would
in
all
probability
have
been
successful
as
the
obstacles
which
afterward
defeated
us
did
not
then
exist
our
camp
had
been
moved
onward
from
murfreesboro
to
shelbyville
which
is
a
beautiful
little
city
situated
on
duck
river
we
camped
above
the
town
in
a
delightful
meadow
it
was
sabbath
the
of
april
and
the
earliness
of
the
clime
made
the
birds
sing
and
the
fields
bloom
with
more
than
the
brilliancy
of
may
in
our
own
northern
land
deeply
is
the
quiet
of
that
sabbath
with
the
green
beauty
of
the
warm
spring
landscape
pictured
on
my
mind
an
impression
i
know
not
what
made
me
devote
the
day
to
writing
letters
to
my
friends
it
was
well
i
did
so
for
long
and
weary
months
passed
ere
i
was
permitted
to
write
to
them
again
but
while
the
day
was
passing
in
such
sweet
repose
with
us
it
was
far
different
in
another
army
that
was
the
day
on
which
grant
was
surprised
by
beauregard
and
only
saved
from
destruction
by
the
assistance
of
the
gunboats
this
however
we
did
not
learn
for
several
days
after
on
monday
andrews
returned
to
our
camp
he
had
spent
some
time
along
the
line
of
the
georgia
state
road
and
on
his
return
reported
to
general
mitchel
that
the
scheme
was
still
feasible
and
would
be
of
more
advantage
than
ever
he
however
asked
for
a
larger
detail
of
men
and
were
given
from
the
three
ohio
regiments
then
in
sill
brigade
one
man
was
detailed
from
a
company
though
all
the
companies
were
not
represented
and
i
believe
in
two
instances
two
men
were
detailed
from
one
company
they
were
probably
intimate
friends
who
wished
to
go
together
one
of
these
i
noticed
only
very
lately
during
the
day
i
saw
andrews
in
the
camp
i
had
seen
him
frequently
before
away
up
in
the
mountains
of
eastern
kentucky
but
did
not
then
observe
him
particularly
now
i
paid
more
attention
he
was
nearly
six
feet
in
hight
of
powerful
frame
black
hair
and
long
black
silken
beard
roman
features
a
high
and
expansive
forehead
and
a
voice
fine
and
soft
as
a
woman
he
gave
me
the
impression
of
a
man
who
combined
intellect
and
refinement
with
the
most
cool
and
dauntless
courage
yet
his
manner
and
speech
which
was
slow
and
pensive
indicated
what
i
afterwards
found
to
be
almost
his
only
fault
a
slowness
to
decide
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
back
his
decision
by
prompt
vigorous
action
this
did
not
detract
from
his
value
as
a
secret
agent
when
alone
for
then
all
his
actions
were
premeditated
and
carried
out
with
surpassing
coolness
and
bravery
but
it
did
unfit
him
for
the
command
of
men
in
startling
emergencies
where
instant
action
afforded
the
only
chance
of
safety
this
trait
of
character
will
be
more
fully
developed
in
the
course
of
my
story
i
conversed
with
him
on
the
object
of
the
expedition
not
of
course
expecting
a
full
detail
but
receiving
a
general
idea
i
put
particular
stress
on
his
promise
that
whatever
happened
he
would
keep
us
all
together
and
if
necessary
we
would
cut
our
way
through
in
a
body
this
was
because
being
and
therefore
a
bad
hand
to
travel
in
a
strange
country
with
no
guide
i
had
a
particular
horror
of
being
left
alone
i
returned
to
my
company
and
procured
a
suit
of
citizen
clothes
from
our
boys
who
had
been
out
before
all
the
members
of
the
company
seeing
me
so
arrayed
came
around
to
try
to
dissuade
me
from
the
enterprise
which
to
them
appeared
full
of
unknown
perils
it
was
gratifying
to
be
the
object
of
so
much
solicitude
but
having
decided
to
go
i
could
not
yield
my
captain
sarratt
of
company
g
second
ohio
as
brave
and
a
soldier
as
ever
lived
earnestly
entreated
me
not
to
go
but
finding
my
determination
was
fixed
he
bade
me
an
affectionate
farewell
seldom
have
i
parted
with
more
emotion
from
any
one
than
these
veterans
it
was
about
four
in
the
afternoon
when
we
left
camp
and
started
for
the
place
of
rendezvous
at
shelbyville
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
and
the
bracing
evening
air
sent
the
blood
coursing
cheerily
through
our
veins
and
inspired
us
with
the
brightest
hopes
of
the
future
soon
we
reached
shelbyville
and
lingered
there
for
an
hour
or
two
when
ross
and
i
acting
under
the
previous
direction
of
andrews
started
out
of
town
our
orders
were
for
us
all
to
proceed
along
the
road
in
small
squads
for
two
or
three
miles
and
then
halt
and
wait
for
him
we
walked
quietly
along
until
about
dark
when
seeing
none
of
the
others
we
began
to
grow
uneasy
fearing
we
had
gone
on
the
wrong
road
we
met
several
persons
but
they
could
give
no
account
of
any
one
before
then
we
saw
a
house
just
by
the
road
and
crossing
the
fence
went
up
to
it
to
get
a
drink
of
water
before
we
reached
the
door
a
dog
came
up
behind
my
companion
and
bit
him
then
ran
away
before
punishment
could
be
inflicted
the
bite
was
not
severe
and
i
laughed
at
his
mishap
but
before
we
again
reached
the
fence
the
same
dog
came
once
more
ross
saw
him
and
sprang
over
the
fence
but
i
had
only
time
to
reach
the
top
of
it
where
i
sat
in
fancied
security
but
the
merciless
whelp
in
his
ire
sprang
at
me
seized
my
coat
and
tore
a
large
piece
out
of
it
that
coat
thus
i
wore
all
through
dixie
i
mention
this
incident
because
it
was
what
some
would
call
a
bad
omen

grew
every

more

darkness
was
falling
rapidly
and
not
one
of
our
comrades
was
visible
we
were
almost
certain
we
had
taken
the
wrong
road
finally
we
resolved
to
retrace
our
steps
and
endeavor
to
obtain
some
clue
to
our
journey
or
if
we
could
not
to
return
to
camp
for
without
instruction
we
knew
not
how
or
where
to
go
we
therefore
retraced
our
steps
till
in
sight
of
shelbyville
and
then
sure
that
none
could
pass
without
our
knowledge
we
waited
nearly
an
hour
longer
our
patience
was
rewarded
a
few
whom
we
recognized
as
belonging
to
our
party
came
along
the
road
we
fell
in
with
them
and
were
soon
overtaken
by
others
among
whom
was
andrews
now
all
was
right
soon
we
were
as
far
from
shelbyville
as
ross
and
i
had
been
when
alone
and
a
few
hundred
yards
further
on
we
found
the
remainder
of
our
comrades
in
a
little
thicket
of
dead
and
withered
trees
sufficiently
open
to
assure
us
that
no
listening
ear
was
near
we
halted
and
andrews
revealed
to
us
his
plans
there
were
gathered
around
him
had
been
detailed
but
from
some
cause
one
had
failed
to
report
in
low
tones
amid
the
darkness
he
gave
us
the
details
of
the
romantic
expedition
we
were
to
break
up
in
small
squads
of
three
or
four
and
travel
as
far
south
as
chattanooga
if
questioned
we
were
to
answer
so
as
to
avoid
exciting
suspicion
and
tell
any
plausible
tale
that
might
answer
our
purpose
we
were
to
travel
rapidly
and
if
possible
reach
chattanooga
on
thursday
evening
at
five
this
was
monday
and
the
distance
was
one
hundred
and
three
miles
a
heavy
travel
on
foot
but
then
we
were
allowed
to
hire
conveyances
if
we
could
andrews
then
gave
us
some
confederate
money
to
bear
our
expenses
and
we
parted
there
were

at

noble
and
generous
william
campbell
a
citizen
of
kentucky
who
had
received
permission
to
come
with
us
in
a
soldier
place
he
was
a
man
of
two
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
weight
handsome
as
apollo
and
of
immense
physical
strength
which
he
was
not
slow
to
use
when
roused
though
and
clever
in
the
main
the
third
was
the
most
remarkable
man
of
the
whole
party
he
was
not
educated
highly
though
he
had
read
a
great
deal
but
in
natural
shrewdness
i
rarely
if
ever
saw
his
equal
he
had
traveled
extensively
over
the
united
states
had
observed
everything
and
remembered
all
he
observed
had
he
lived
the
composition
of
this
book
would
have
been
in
abler
hands
than
mine
in
addition
to
this
he
excelled
perhaps
even
parson
brownlow
in
the
fiery
and
scorching
denunciation
he
could
hurl
on
the
head
of
an
opponent
in
action
he
was
brave
and
cool
no
danger
could
frighten
him
no
emergency
find
him
unprepared
these
were
my
companions
the
rain
had
begun
to
fall
slightly
as
we
walked
out
the
railroad
on
our
route
and
soon
it
increased
to
torrents
the
night
was
pitchy
dark
and
we
stumbled
along
falling
into
gutters
here
and
nearly
sticking
in
the
mud
there
until
midnight
when
we
resolved
to
seek
shelter
from
the
storm
for
a
long
time
we
could
find
no
indication
of
a
house
until
at
last
the
barking
of
a
dog
gave
us
a
clue
after
some
dispute
as
to
which
side
of
the
road
it
was
on
we
struck
off
over
a
field
our
only
guide
were
the
random
flashes
of
lightning
that
gave
us
a
momentary
view
of
the
country
around
the
better
to
prosecute
our
search
we
formed
a
line
within
hearing
distance
of
each
other
and
thus
swept
around
in
all
directions
at
last
we
found
a
barn
but
were
so
wet
and
chilly
that
we
resolved
to
hunt
on
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
fire
and
a
bed
after
a
still
more
tedious
search
we
found
the
goal
of
our
wishes
it
was
a
rude
double
here
we
roused
up
the
inmates
and
demanded
a
shelter
for
the
night
the
man
of
the
house
was
evidently
alarmed
but
let
us
in
and
then
commenced
questioning
us
as
to
who
we
were
we
told
him
we
were
kentuckians
who
were
disgusted
with
the
tyranny
of
the
lincoln
government
and
were
seeking
an
asylum
in
the
free
and
independent
south
oh
said
he
you
come
on
a
bootless
errand
and
had
better
go
back
home
for
i
have
no
doubt
the
whole
of
the
south
will
soon
be
as
much
under
lincoln
as
kentucky
is
never
we
answered
we
will
fight
till
we
die
first
at
this
the
old
man
chuckled
quietly
and
only
said
well
we
see
we
see
which
closed
the
discussion
we
were
truly
glad
to
find
a
union
man
under
such
circumstances
but
did
not
dare
to
reveal
our
true
character
to
him
and
he
probably
believes
to
this
day
that
he
harbored
some
chivalric
southerners
however
he
provided
us
with
a
good
supper
and
a
comfortable
bed
promising
also
not
to
inform
the
federal
pickets
on
us
the
next
morning
the
sky
for
a
time
was
clear
but
it
soon
became
overcast
and
we
were
again
compelled
to
suffer
the
inevitable
drenching
that
befel
us
every
day
of
this
dreary
journey
we
reached
wartrace
in
the
midst
of
a
pelting
storm
at
first
we
intended
to
go
around
the
town
as
it
was
the
last
station
on
our
picket
line
it
was
raining
so
hard
that
we
thought
we
would
not
be
interrupted
in
passing
through
it
but
our
guards
were
too
vigilant
for
us
they
stopped
us
and
after
being
for
some
time
detained
and
trying
to
play
off
the
innocent
southern
citizen
as
hundreds
do
we
were
obliged
to
reveal
our
true
character
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
post
which
of
course
secured
our
release
then
again
we
traveled
onward
for
a
time
wading
the
swollen
creeks
and
plodding
through
the
mud
as
fast
as
we
could
we
were
now
outside
of
our
lines
with
nothing
to
trust
to
but
the
tender
mercies
of
the
rebels
soon
after
we
found
what
a
slender
ground
of
trust
that
was
but
we
were
safe
in
the
completeness
of
our
disguise
we
met
many
others
of
our
party
and
trudged
along
sometimes
in
company
with
them
but
oftener
alone
toward
evening
we
reached
manchester
crossed
duck
river
which
was
at
flood
hight
and
entered
the
town
here
we
found
the
population
in
a
wild
ferment
and
on
inquiring
the
cause
learned
that
some
of
the
citizens
had
reported
an
approaching
band
of
yankee
cavalry
and
that
they
were
even
now
visible
from
the
public
square
we
repaired
thither
with
all
speed
to
witness
the
novel
spectacle
of
the
entrance
of
national
troops
into
a
hostile
town
from
a
southern
point
of
view
mingled
were
the
emotions
expressed
fear
was
most
prominent
but
i
thought
i
could
detect
on
some
countenances
a
smile
of
exultation
soon
the
terrible
band
loomed
up
over
the
hill
which
bounded
the
view
when
lo
the
dreaded
enemies
were
seen
to
be
only
a
party
of
negroes
who
had
been
working
in
the
coal
mines
in
the
mountains
somewhere
some
of
mitchel
men
had
destroyed
the
works
and
the
contrabands
were
brought
here
for
safe
keeping
the
feelings
of
the
chivalry
may
be
better
imagined
than
described
as
they
dispersed
with
curses
on
the
whole
african
race
we
here
obtained
from
some
of
the
citizens
the
names
of
the
most
prominent
secessionists
along
the
route
we
were
to
travel
who
would
be
most
likely
to
help
us
on
to
that
blissful
land
where
we
might
enjoy
our
rights
in
peace
undisturbed
by
even
dreams
of
abolitionists
these
names
were
a
great
advantage
to
us
because
always
having
some
one
to
inquire
for
and
being
recommended
from
one
influential
man
to
another
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
we
were
trustworthy
characters
and
few
questions
asked
that
night
we
were
within
a
few
miles
of
hillsboro
but
so
much
were
we
delayed
by
the
rain
that
we
began
to
fear
we
could
not
reach
our
destination
in
time
my
feet
too
were
sore
from
the
gravel
and
dirt
that
filled
my
shoes
in
crossing
the
creeks
and
wading
through
the
mud
and
already
we
were
weary
and
stiff
from
traveling
in
the
wet
but
we
resolved
to
press
on
and
if
necessary
to
travel
in
the
night
too
rather
than
miss
our
appointment
where
we
stayed
that
night
i
first
heard
from
the
lips
of
a
himself
of
hunting
negroes
with
bloodhounds
our
host
said
he
had
seen
some
one
dodging
around
the
back
of
his
plantation
by
the
edge
of
the
woods
just
as
it
was
getting
dark
and
in
the
morning
he
would
take
his
bloodhounds
and
go
to
hunt
him
up
and
if
it
proved
to
be
a
negro
he
would
get
the
reward
he
said
he
had
caught
great
numbers
of
them
and
seemed
to
regard
it
as
a
highly
profitable
business
we
of
course
had
to
agree
with
him
but
i
well
remember
that
the
idea
of
hunting
human
beings
with
bloodhounds
for
money
sent
a
thrill
of
horror
and
detestation
through
my
veins
not
long
after
we
found
that
bloodhounds
were
not
for
negroes
alone
the
next
morning
we
continued
our
journey
and
after
walking
three
miles
found
a
man
who
agreed
for
an
exorbitant
price
and
for
the
good
of
the
confederacy
to
give
us
conveyance
in
a
wagon
for
a
few
miles
this
was
a
great
help
to
us
and
as
we
trotted
briskly
along
we
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
cumberland
mountains
never
did
i
behold
more
beautiful
scenery
the
rain
had
for
a
short
time
ceased
to
fall
and
the
air
was
clear
the
mountains
shone
in
the
freshest
green
and
around
their
tops
just
high
enough
to
veil
their
loftiest
summits
clung
a
soft
shadowy
mist
gradually
descending
lower
shrouding
one
after
another
of
the
spurs
and
high
mountain
valleys
from
view
but
the
beautiful
scene
did
not
long
continue
soon
the
mist
deepened
into
cloud
and
again
the
interminable
rain
began
to
fall
to
add
to
our
discomforts
our
wagon
would
go
no
further
and
once
more
we
trudged
along
afoot
at
noon
we
stopped
for
dinner
at
a
house
belonging
to

name

to
the
poor
class

no
property
of
their
own
and
live
in
small
hovels
on
the
worst
portions
of
the
lands
of
the
rich
here
they
lead
an
ignorant
lazy
life
devoting
most
of
their
time
to
hunting
and
fishing
only
raising
a
little
patch
of
corn
to
furnish
their
bread
they
are
almost
as
completely
owned
by
their
landlords
as
the
slaves
and
are
compelled
to
vote
as
their
masters
choose
in
the
social
scale
they
are
no
higher
than
any
slave
nor
do
they
deserve
to
be
for
their
intelligence
is
less
the
term
or
is
a
terrible
one
of
reproach
and
is
applied
unsparingly
by
the
aristocrats
of
course
our
entertainment
here
was
composed
of
rather
rude
fare
but
we
ate
the
and
corn
bread
with
the
strong
pork
and
went

described
very
minutely
to
me
little
did
he
think
that
i
too
had
been
there
as
we
laughed
together
at
the
wild
panic
of
the
yankees
he
was
greatly
delighted
to
see
so
many
kentuckians
coming
out
on
the
right
side
and
contrasted
our
noble
conduct
with
that
of
some
persons
of
his
own
neighborhood
who
still
sympathized
with
the
abolitionists
when
we
parted
he
grasped
my
hand
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
said
he
hoped
the
time
would
soon
come
when
we
would
be
comrades
fighting
side
by
side
in
one
glorious
cause
my
heart
revolted
from
the
hypocrisy
i
was
compelled
to
use
but
having
commenced
there
was
no
possibility
of
turning
back
on
we
clambered
up
the
mountain
till
the
top
was
reached
then
across
the
summit
which
was
a
tolerably
level
road
for
six
miles
then
down
again
over
steep
rocks
yawning
chasms
and
great
gullies
a
road
that
none
but
east
tennesseeans
or
soldier
yankees
could
have
traveled
at
all
this
rough
jaunt
led
us
down
into
battle
creek
which
is
a
delightful
picturesque
valley
hemmed
in
by
projecting
ridges
of
lofty
mountains
while
here
they
told
me
how
this
valley
obtained
its
name
which
is
certainly
a
very
romantic
legend
and
no
doubt
true
in
early
times
there
was
war
among
the
indians
one
tribe
made
a
plundering
expedition
into
the
camp
of
another
and
after
securing
their
booty
retreated
of
course
they
were
pursued
and
in
their
flight
were
traced
to
this
valley
there
the
pursuers
believed
them
to
be
concealed
and
to
make
their
capture
sure
divided
their
force
into
two
bands
each
one
taking
an
opposite
side
of
the
valley
it
was
early
in
the
morning
and
as
they
wended
their
way
cautiously
onward
the
mountain
mist
came
down
just
as
i
had
seen
it
descend
that
morning
and
enveloped
each
of
the
parties
in
its
folds
determined
not
to
be
foiled
they
marched
on
and
meeting
at
the
head
of
the
valley
each
supposed
the
other
to
be
the
enemy
they
poured
in
their
fire
and
a
deadly
conflict
ensued
not
till
nearly
all
their
number
had
fallen
did
the
survivors
discover
their
mistake
and
they
slowly
and
sorrowfully
returned
to
their
wigwams
the
plunderers
who
had
listened
to
their
conflict
in
safety
being
further
up
the
mountains
were
thus
left
to
carry
home
their
booty
in
triumph
but
we
had
no
leisure
for
legendary
tales
the
sun
had
set
and
we
stopped
for
the
night
with
a
rabid
secessionist
whom
our
on
the
mountain
had
recommended
to
us
he
received
us
with
open
arms
shared
with
us
the
best
his
house
afforded
giving
us
his
bedroom
and
sleeping
with
his
family
in
the
kitchen
we
spent
the
evening
in
denouncing
the
abolitionists
which
term
was
used
indiscriminately
to
designate
all
federals
who
did
not
advocate
the
acknowledgment
of
the
confederacy
this
did
not
go
quite
so
hard
as
it
did
at
first
for
practice
had
rendered
it
nearly
as
easy
for
us
to
falsify
our
sentiments
as
to
express
them
plainly
among
other
things
we
instanced
to
show
the
tyranny
of
the
lincolnites
in
kentucky
was
the
expatriation
law
this
law
provides
that
all
persons
aiding
or
abetting
the
rebels
or
leaving
the
state
and
going
south
with
their
army
shall
be
and
lose
all
their
right
of
citizenship
in
the
state
the
old
man
thought
this
was
an
act
of
unparalleled
oppression
and
in
the
morning
before
i
was
out
of
bed
came
in
the
room
and
desired
that
some
one
of
us
would
write
that
law
down
that
he
might
show
his
union
neighbors
what
the
yankees
would
do
when
they
had
the
sway
i
wrote
it
and
we
all
afterward
signed
our
names
to
it
no
doubt
that
document
has
been
the
theme
of
many
angry
discussions
so
thoroughly
did
we
deceive
the
old
man
that
when
three
days
after
the
railroad
adventure
fell
on
the
astonished
confederates
like
a
clap
of
thunder
out
of
a
clear
sky
he
would
not
believe
that
we
were
part
of
the
men
engaged
in
it
one
of
his
neighbors
who
was
a
union
man
and
was
arrested
and
confined
in
the
same
prison
with
us
told
us
that
to
the
last
our
host
maintained
that
his
guests
at
least
were
true
and
loyal
southerners
should
i
ever
again
be
in
that
part
of
the
country
i
would
delight
to
call
on
him
in
my
true
character
and
talk
over
the
national
troubles
from
another
point
of
view
we
stayed
with
him
wednesday
night
and
were
still
a
long
way
from
chattanooga
we
had
designed
notwithstanding
our
weariness
to
travel
all
that
night
but
accidentally
met
some
of
our
comrades
who
had
seen
andrews
who
informed
them
that
he
had
postponed
the
enterprise
one
day
longer
this
was
a
great
relief
as
it
saved
us
a
most
wearisome
and
dreaded
night
tramp
but
better
to
have
taken
it
for
the
delay
of
that
day
was
fatal
on
friday
there
would
have
been
no
extra
trains
to
meet
and
our
success
would
have
been
sure
but
this
we
did
not
know
at
the
time
the
next
day
which
was
thursday
we
came
to
jasper
stopped
in
the
town
and
around
the
groceries
awhile
talking
of
the
state
of
the
country
we
told
them
kentucky
was
just
ready
to
rise
and
shake
off
her
chains
and
they
were
just
foolish
enough
to
believe
it
here
we
heard
the
first
indistinct
rumor
of
the
battle
of
shiloh
of
course
a
wonderful
victory
to
the
rebels
killing
thousands
of
yankees
and
capturing
innumerable
cannon
it
was
the
impression
that
our
army
was
totally
destroyed
one
countryman
gravely
assured
me
that
five
hundred
gunboats
had
been
sunk
i
told
him
i
did
not
think
the
yankees
had
so
many
as
that
but
was
unable
to
shake
his
faith
that
night
we
stayed
at
widow
hall
and
there
met
andrews
and
some
of
our
other
comrades
this
was
on
the
banks
of
the
tennessee
river
and
andrews
advised
us
to
cross
there
and
to
take
passage
on
the
cars
at
shell
mound
station
as
there
had
been
a
stringent
order
issued
to
let
no
one
cross
above
who
could
not
present
perfectly
satisfactory
credentials
andrews
had
these
but
we
had
not
it
was
therefore
advisable
for
us
to
be
challenged
as
few
times
as
possible
we
passed
a
pleasant
evening
during
which
the
wit
of
my
friend
shadrack
kept
us
in
a
continual
roar
of
laughter
at
last
morning
came
and
we
went
down
to
the
bank
of
the
river
to
cross
the
ferryman
had
just
swung
the
boat
into
the
stream
and
we
were
getting
into
it
when
a
man
arrived
with
positive
orders
from
the
military
authorities
to
let
no
one
across
for
three
days
affairs
now
looked
dark
we
could
not
cross
except
at
the
upper
ferries
and
not
there
unless
our
credentials
were
good
however
we
resolved
to
persevere
and
thinking
in
this
case
as
in
many
others
the
boldest
plan
would
be
the
safest
we
again
struck
over
the
wild
spurs
of
the
cumberland
which
here
sweep
directly
down
to
the
river
on
in
the
direction
of
chattanooga
with
the
intention
of
trying
to
cross
there
at
headquarters
our
journey
was
far
from
a
pleasant
one
and
several
times
we
lost
our
road
in
the
entanglements
of
the
mountains
but
at
last
we
reached
a
valley
that
ran
directly
down
to
the
river
opposite
chattanooga
here
the
road
was
more
frequented
and
from
the
travelers
we
met
we
learned
further
particulars
of
the
battle
of
shiloh
still
the
accounts
were
for
the
confederates
though
they
now
admitted
a
considerable
loss
one
man
gave
me
an
interesting
item
of
news
from
the
east
it
was
that
the
merrimac
had
steamed
out
and
after
engaging
the
monitor
for
some
time
with
no
decisive
results
had
ran
alongside
and
throwing
on
her
towed
her
ashore
where
of
course
she
fell
an
easy
prey
he
said
that
now
they
had
the
two
best
gunboats
in
the
world
and
they
would
be
able
to
raise
the
blockade
without
difficulty
and
even
to
burn
the
northern
cities
but
i
have
not
space
to
tell
of
all
the
wild
chimeras
and
absurd
stories
that
we
heard
on
our
entrance
into
a
land
where
truth
always
has
been
contraband
from
that
time
forward
we
heard
of
continuous
confederate
victories
and
not
one
union
triumph
till
in
september
when
they
admitted
that
they
were
repulsed
by
rosecrans
at
corinth
on
reaching
the
river
we
found
a
great
number
of
persons
on
the
bank
waiting
to
go
over
the
ferryman
was
there
with
a
but
the
wind
was
so
high
that
he
feared
to
attempt
the
crossing
we
waited
as
patiently
as
we
could
though
the
time
for
the
cars
to
start
on
the
other
side
had
nearly
arrived
and
we
could
not
well
afford
to
miss
them
at
length
the
ferryman
agreed
to
attempt
the
passage
he
found
it
very
difficult
we
were
about
an
hour
in
crossing
though
the
river
was
only
a
few
hundred
yards
in
width
several
times
we
were
beaten
back
to
our
own
side
but
at
last
perseverance
conquered
and
we
landed
at
chattanooga
the
passage
was
an
anxious
one
for
we
expected
to
find
the
guard
waiting
for
us
on
the
other
side
and
then
if
we
failed
to
satisfy
them
that
we
were
loyal
subjects
of
king
jefferson
we
would
at
once
land
in
a
southern
prison
judge
then
of
our
delight
when
we
saw
no
guard
there
and
were
permitted
to
pass
unmolested
and
unquestioned
on
our
route
i
do
not
yet
know
the
reason
of
this
sudden
relaxation
of
vigilance
perhaps
it
was
because
all
their
attention
was
directed
to
huntsville
which
was
now
occupied
in
force
by
general
mitchel
the
panic
produced
by
this
occupation
was
immense
as
the
only
communication
it
left
them
with
beauregard
was
by
the
circuitous
route
through
atlanta
and
when
the
next
day
this
too
was
endangered
their
excitement
knew
no
bounds
chattanooga
is
a
small
town
not
much
more
than
a
village
it
is
pleasantly
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
tennessee
and
is
bowered
in
amidst
lofty
mountain
peaks
one
of
these
hangs
right
over
the
town
and
is
more
than
seven
hundred
feet
in
perpendicular
hight
from
its
summit
parts
of
four
states
are
visible
tennessee
georgia
alabama
and
north
carolina
it
is
capable
of
being
very
strongly
fortified
and
though
there
were
no
works
erected
when
i
was
there
many
may
have
been
built
since
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
strategic
points
in
the
whole
south
and
should
have
been
in
the
possession
of
our
forces
long
ago
from
the
river
we
went
directly
to
the
depot
some
of
our
party
had
arrived
earlier
and
gone
down
to
marietta
on
a
former
train
we
found
the
cars
nearly
ready
to
start
and
after
loitering
around
a
few
minutes
in
the
depot
which
was
crowded
full
of
travelers
mostly
soldiers
we
purchased
our
tickets
and
got
aboard
the
cars
were
jammed
full
there
was
scarcely
room
to
stand
many
of
the
passengers
were
soldiers
who
had
been
at
home
on
furlough
and
were
returning
to
join
beauregard
the
conversation
was
mostly
on
the
great
battle
which
had
just
been
fought
and
the
accounts
were
by
no
means
so
glowing
as
they
had
been
at
first
still
they
announced
a
great
victory
we
took
part
in
the
conversation
and
expressing
as
much
interest
as
any
one
our
true
character
was
not
suspected
there
was
at
this
time
no
system
of
passports
in
use
on
that
line
and
travel
was
entirely
unrestricted
the
sun
was
about
an
hour
high
as
we
glided
out
of
the
depot
and
soon
sunk
to
rest
behind
the
hills
of
georgia
there
were
many
bridges
on
the
road
and
as
we
passed
over
them
we
could
not
help
picturing
to
ourselves
our
proposed
return
on
the
morrow
and
the
probabilities
of
the
destruction
we
intended
to
wreck
on
them
darkness
gradually
closed
in
and
on
we
went
amid
the
laughter
and
oaths
of
the
confederates
many
of
whom
were
very
much
intoxicated
i
procured
a
seat
on
the
and
for
awhile
gave
myself
up
to
the
reflections
naturally
suggested
by
the
near
culmination
of
the
enterprise
in
which
i
was
engaged
visions
of
former
days
and
friends
dear
friends
both
around
the
and
by
the
hearth
of
home
whom
i
might
never
see
again
floated
before
me
but
gradually
as
the
night
wore
on
these
faded
and
i
slept
at
midnight
we
were
wakened
by
the
conductor
calling
marietta
the
goal
was
reached
we
were
in
the
center
of
the
confederacy
with
our
deadly
enemies
all
around
before
we
left
we
were
to
strike
a
blow
that
would
either
make
all
rebeldom
vibrate
to
the
center
or
be
ourselves
at
the
mercy
of
the
merciless
it
was
a
time
for
solemn
thought
but
we
were
too
weary
to
indulge
in
speculations
of
the
future
we
retired
to
bed
in
the
tremont
house
and
were
soon
folded
in
sweet
slumbers
the
last
time
we
slept
on
a
bed
for
many
weary
months

us
at

in

as
we
told
him
we
wished
to
take
the
train
at
that
hour
back
to
camp
mcdonald
which
is
located
at
a
place
called
big
shanty
eight
miles
north
of
marietta
and
is
also
a
breakfast
station
andrews
had
gone
to
another
hotel
and
warned
the
members
of
the
party
there
to
be
in
readiness
to
take
passage
two
of
them
hawkins
and
porter
who
had
arrived
earlier
were
not
warned
and
were
therefore
left
behind
it
was
not
their
fault
as
they
had
no
certain
knowledge
of
the
time
we
were
to
start
but
rather
thought
it
would
be
the
next
day
there
were
just
twenty
of
us
on
the
train
andrews
and
nineteen
others
of
whom
several
were
engineers
we
went
along
very
quietly
and
inoffensively
just
as
any
other
passengers
would
do
until
we
reached
big
shanty
i
knew
that
we
were
to
take
possession
of
the
train
at
this
place
but
did
not
just
know
how
it
was
to
be
done
i
thought
we
would
probably
have
to
fight
and
compel
the
conductor
and
passengers
to
get
off
we
might
have
done
this
but
it
would
have
required
very
quick
work
for
there
were
then
some
ten
thousand
troops
mostly
conscripts
camped
there
and
a
guard
was
placed
watching
the
train
but
a
far
better
plan
was
adopted
as
soon
as
we
arrived
the
engineer
conductor
and
many
of
the
passengers
went
over
to
the
now
was
our
opportunity
andrews
and
one
or
two
others
went
forward
and
examined
the
track
to
see
if
everything
was
in
readiness
for
a
rapid
start
oh
what
a
thrilling
moment
was
that
our
hearts
throbbed
thick
and
fast
with
emotions
we
dared
not
manifest
to
those
who
were
loafing
indifferently
around
in
a
minute
which
seemed
an
hour
andrews
came
back
opened
the
door
and
said
very
quietly
and
carelessly
let
us
go
now
boys
just
as
quietly
and
carelessly
we
arose
and
followed
him
the
passengers
who
were
lazily
waiting
for
the
train
to
move
on
and
carry
them
to
their
destination
saw
nothing
in
the
transaction
to
excite
their
suspicions
leisurely
we
moved
forward
reached
the
head
of
the
train
then
andrews
brown
our
engineer
and
knight
who
also
could
run
an
engine
leaped
on
the
locomotive
alfred
wilson
took
the
top
of
the
cars
as
brakesman
and
the
remainder
of
us
clambered
into
the

page
there
are
times
in
the
life
of
man
when
whole
years
of
intensest
enjoyment
seem
condensed
into
a
single
moment
it
was
so
with
me
then
i
could
comprehend
the
emotion
of
columbus
when
he
first
beheld
through
the
dim
dawn
of
morning
the
new
found
but
long
shores
of
america
or
the
less
innocent
but
no
less
vivid
joy
of
cortez
when
he
first
planted
the
cross
of
spain
over
the
golden
halls
of
montezuma
my
breast
throbbed
full
with
emotions
of
delight
and
gladness
that
words
labor
in
vain
to
express
a
sense
of
ethereal
lightness
ran
through
all
my
veins
and
i
seemed
to
be
ascending
higher
higher
into
realms
of
inexpressible
bliss
with
each
pulsation
of
the
engine
it
was
a
moment
of
triumphant
joy
that
will
never
return
again
not
a
dream
of
failure
now
shadowed
my
rapture
all
had
told
us
that
the
greatest
difficulty
was
to
reach
and
take
possession
of
the
engine
and
after
that
success
was
certain
would
have
but
for
unforeseen
contingencies
away
we
scoured
passing
field
and
village
and
woodland
at
each
leap
of
the
engine
our
hearts
rose
higher
and
we
talked
merrily
of
the
welcome
that
would
greet
us
when
we
dashed
into
huntsville
a
few
hours
later
our
enterprise
done
and
the
brightest
laurels
of
the
guerilla
morgan
far
eclipsed
but
the
telegraph
ran
by
our
side
and
was
able
by
the
flashing
of
a
single
lightning
message
ahead
to
arrest
our
progress
and
dissipate
all
our
fondest
hopes
there
was
no
telegraphic
station
where
we
took
the
train
but
we
knew
not
how
soon
our
enemies
might
reach
one
or
whether
they
might
not
have
a
portable
battery
at
command
to
obviate
all
danger
on
this
point
we
stopped
after
running
some
four
miles
to
cut
the
wire
john
scott
an
active
young
man
climbed
the
pole
and
with
his
hand
knocked
off
the
insulated
box
at
the
top
and
swung
down
on
the
wire
fortunately
there
was
a
small
saw
on
the
engine
with
which
the
wire
was
soon
severed
while
this
was
being
done
another
party
took
up
a
rail
and
put
it
into
the
car
to
carry
off
with
us
this
did
not
long
check
our
pursuers
but
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
learning
that
it
threw
them
down
an
embankment
as
will
be
narrated
more
fully
in
a
confederate
account
inserted
hereafter
when
the
engine
first
stopped
andrews
jumped
off
clasped
our
hands
in
ecstasy
congratulating
us
that
our
difficulties
were
now
all
over
that
we
had
the
enemy
at
such
a
disadvantage
that
he
could
not
harm
us
and
exhibited
every
sign
of
joy
said
he
only
one
more
train
to
pass
and
then
we
will
put
our
engine
to
full
speed
burn
the
bridges
after
us
dash
through
chattanooga
and
on
to
mitchel
at
huntsville
the
programme
would
have
been
filled
if
we
had
met
train
we
were
ahead
of
time
and
in
order
to
meet
the
down
train
just
time
we
were
obliged
to
stop
on
the
track
awhile
these
were
tedious
moments
while
we
waited
but
soon
we
moved
on
very
slowly
again
at
the
next
station
andrews
borrowed
a
schedule
from
the
telling
him
that
he
was
running
an
express
through
to
beauregard
he
gave
the
schedule
saying
that
he
would
send
his
shirt
to
beauregard
if
he
wanted
it
when
asked
afterwards
if
he
did
not
suspect
anything
he
said
he
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
suspecting
jeff
davis
as
one
who
talked
with
so
much
assurance
as
andrews
did
on
we
went
till
we
reached
the
station
where
we
were
to
pass
what
we
believed
to
be
the
last
train
here
the
switch
was
not
properly
adjusted
and
andrews
entered
the
without
asking
leave
of
anybody
took
down
the
keys
and
adjusted
the
switch
this
raised
some
disturbance
on
the
part
of
those
around
the
station
but
it
was
quieted
by
telling
them
the
same
powder
story
after
waiting
a
short
time
the
down
train
arrived
and
we
passed
it
without
difficulty
but
we
observed
on
it
what
we
did
not
like
a
indicating
that
another
train
was
behind
this
was
most
discouraging
for
we
had
now
hoped
to
have
the
road
exclusively
to
ourselves
but
still
we
did
not
despair
however
we
had
yet
to
run
on
regular
time
which
was
unfortunately
very
time
not
more
than
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
an
hour
thus
unavoidably
consuming
our
precious
moments
we
glided
on
till
we
reached
the
station
where
we
expected
to
meet
what
we
were
now
sure
would
be
our
last
hindrance
we
stopped
on
a
to
wait
for
it
and
there
had
to
remain
minutes
just
as
we
had
concluded
to
go
on
and
risk
the
chances
of
a
collision
the
expected
train
hove
in
sight
it
was
safely
passed
as
the
other
had
been
before
but
judge
of
our
dismay
when
we
beheld
a
on
this
train
also
matters
now
began
to
look
dark
much
of
our
precious
time
which
we
had
reserved
as
a
margin
for
burning
bridges
was
now
gone
and
we
were
still
tied
down
to
the
slow
regular
rate
of
running
yet
we
could
not
retreat
and
had
no
resource
but
to
press
firmly
on
this
we
did
and
obstructed
the
track
as
well
as
we
could
by
laying
on
at
different
places
we
also
cut
the
telegraph
wire
between
every
station
finally
when
we
were
nearly
to
the
station
where
we
expected
to
meet
the
last
train
we
stopped
to
take
up
a
rail
we
had
no
instruments
for
doing
this
except
a
crowbar
and
instead
of
pulling
out
the
spikes
as
we
could
have
done
with
the
pinch
burrs
used
for
that
purpose
by
railroad
men
we
had
to
them
out
this
was
slow
work
we
had
loosened
this
rail
at
one
end
and
eight
of
us
took
hold
of
it
to
try
to
pull
the
other
end
loose
just
as
we
were
going
to
relinquish
the
effort
in
despair
the
of
an
engine
in
pursuit
sounded
in
our
the
effect
was
magical
with
one
convulsive
effort
we
broke
the
rail
in
two
and
tumbled
over
the
embankment
no
one
was
hurt
and
we
took
up
our
precious
half
rail
which
insured
us
time
to
pass
the
train
ahead
before
our
pursuers
could
be
upon
us
we
were
not
a
moment
too
soon
for
we
were
scarcely
out
of
sight
of
where
we
had
taken
up
the
last
rail
before
the
other
train
met
us
this
was
safely
passed
and
when
our
pursuers
came
to
the
place
where
we
had
broken
the
rail
they
abandoned
their
own
train
and
ran
on
foot
till
they
met
the
one
we
had
just
passed
and
turned
it
back
after
us
running
with
great
speed
we
were
now
aware
of
our
danger
and
adopted
every
expedient
we
could
think
of
to
delay
pursuit
but
as
we
were
cutting
the
wire
near
calhoun
they
came
in
sight
of
us
then
ensued
the
most
terrible
and
thrilling
chase
ever
known
on
the
american
continent
we
instantly
put
our
engine
to
full
speed
and
in
a
moment
its
wheels
were
striking
fire
from
the
rails
in
their
rapid
revolutions
the
car
in
which
we
were
rocked
furiously
and
threw
us
from
one
side
to
the
other
like
peas
rattled
in
a
gourd
still
on
after
us
relentlessly
came
the
pursuers
the
smoke
of
their
engine
could
be
distinguished
in
every
long
reach
and
the
scream
of
their
whistle
sounded
in
our
ears
around
every
curve
it
was
still
necessary
for
us
to
cut
the
wire
and
in
order
to
gain
time
for
that
we
dropped
a
car
on
the
track
and
soon
after
another
this
left
us
with
only
the
locomotive
tender
and
one
each
time
when
we
stopped
to
cut
the
wire
we
would
try
to
take
up
another
rail
but
before
we
could
loosen
its
fastenings
with
our
imperfect
tools
the
approach
of
our
enemies
would
compel
us
to
hasten
on
the
thought
of
a
new
expedient
crossed
my
mind
which
saved
us
for
some
time
longer
it
was
to
knock
out
the
end
of
our
car
and
drop
the
rails
on
the
track
as
we
ran
soon
after
in
one
of
our
necessary
stoppages
to
take
care
of
the
telegraph
we
loaded
on
some
cross
ties
which
we
threw
out
in
the
same
manner
one
rail
i
reserved
for
a
particular
purpose
when
we
stopped
again
i
took
it
placed
one
end
under
the
track
and
let
the
other
project
upward
jointing
toward
the
advancing
train
it
was
very
nearly
effectual
the
engineer
of
the
train
in
pursuit
who
afterward
visited
us
in
prison
said
that
if
it
had
been
only
one
inch
higher
nothing
could
have
saved
their
train
from
wreck
because
being
so
dark
and
small
it
was
not
noticed
till
too
late
to
stop
however
it
was
a
little
too
low
to
hook
in
the
bars
of
the
as
i
intended
our
enemies
pursued
us
with
great
determination
one
man
rode
on
the
and
springing
off
would
throw
the
obstructions
from
the
track
and
jump
on
again
while
they
had
merely
checked
the
engine
so
great
was
our
velocity
that
most
of
the
ties
we
threw
out
bounced
off
the
track
but
the
few
that
remained
enabled
us
several
times
to
get
out
of
sight
of
them
when
this
was
the
case
we
would
stop
and
again
try
to
take
up
a
rail
which
would
have
given
us
leisure
for
the
greater
operation
of
burning
a
bridge
by
this
time
we
had
a
few
more
instruments
which
andrews
and
wilson
had
simultaneously
procured
from
a
switch
tender
we
worked
faithfully
but
each
time
before
we
had
loosened
a
rail
the
inexorable
pursuers
were
again
visible
i
then
proposed
to
andrews
a
plan
that
afforded
a
hope
of
final
escape
it
was
to
let
our
engineer
take
our
engine
on
out
of
sight
while
we
hid
on
a
curve
after
putting
a
tie
on
the
track
and
waited
for
the
pursuing
train
to
come
up
then
when
they
checked
to
remove
the
obstruction
we
could
rush
on
them
shoot
every
person
on
the
engine
reverse
it
and
let
it
drive
at
will
back
as
it
came
it
would
have
chased
all
the
trains
following
of
which
there
were
now
two
or
three
back
before
it
and
thus
have
stopped
the
whole
pursuit
for
a
time
this
would
have
required
quick
work
and
have
been
somewhat
dangerous
as
the
trains
were
now
loaded
with
soldiers
but
it
afforded
a
of
success
andrews
said
it
was
a
good
plan
looked
all
around
and
then
hurried
to
the
engine
and
i
had
no
further
opportunity
of
discussing
the
subject
after
we
were
in
prison
he
said
he
was
very
sorry
that
we
had
not
made
the
effort
chapter

a
capital
error
in

woods
a
thrilling
account
of
the
chase
from
the
atlanta
all
this
time
we
were
rushing
through
towns
and
villages
at
terrific
speed
some
passengers
came
down
when
they
heard
our
whistle
to
go
aboard
but
they
all
shrank
back
amazed
when
they
saw
us
pass
with
the
noise
of
thunder
and
the
speed
of
lightning
still
more
were
they
astonished
when
they
saw
three
other
trains
dashing
by
in
close
pursuit
and
loaded
with
excited
soldiers
thus
the
chase
continued
through
dalton
ringgold
and
the
other
small
towns
on
the
route
but
it
soon
became
evident
that
it
could
not
continue
much
longer
we
had
taken
on
wood
and
water
before
we
were
so
closely
pressed
but
now
our
supply
was
nearly
exhausted
and
our
pursuers
were
too
close
behind
to
permit
us
to
replenish
it
but
before
yielding
we
resolved
to
try
one
more
expedient
for
this
purpose
we
broke
open
the
forward
end
of
the
only
we
had
left
and
with
the
fragments
endeavored
to
kindle
a
fire
in
it
had
we
succeeded
we
would
have
detached
it
left
it
burning
on
a
bridge
and
run
on
with
the
locomotive
alone
but
the
fuel
on
the
latter
was
too
nearly
gone
to
afford
us
kindling
wood
and
the
draught
through
the
car
caused
by
our
rapid
motion
blew
our
matches
out
at
length
we
succeeded
in
kindling
a
small
fire
but
the
drizzling
rain
which
had
been
falling
all
morning
blew
in
on
it
and
prevented
it
from
burning
rapidly
enough
to
be
of
any
service
thus
our
last
hope
expired
and
our
magnificent
scheme
on
which
we
had
so
long
thought
and
toiled
was
a
failure
but
one
thing
more
now
remained
to
save
ourselves
if
possible
we
were
within
perhaps
fifteen
miles
of
chattanooga
when
we
resolved
to
abandon
the
engine
having
made
this
resolve
we
did
not
cut
the
telegraph
wire
and
then
for
the
first
time
they
succeeded
in
sending
a
message
ahead
of
us
this
was
no
serious
detriment
to
us
but
it
raised
the
wildest
excitement
in
chattanooga
the
women
and
children
instantly
fled
from
the
town
and
sought
safety
in
the
woods
and
mountains
the
whole
military
force
which
was
encamped
near
the
place
came
out
and
selected
an
advantageous
position
to
meet
us
there
they
planted
cannon
felled
trees
across
the
track
tore
up
the
rails
for
some
distance
and
waited
for
our
approach
their
orders
were
for
them
to
make
a
general
massacre
not
to
spare
a
single
man
but
we
came
not
and
therefore
they
had
no
opportunity
to
display
their
latent
cruelty
it
was
at
this
point
when
he
saw
every
scheme
we
attempted
to
execute
completely
foiled
that
andrews
presence
of
mind
for
a
time
seemed
to
desert
him
it
was
only
fifteen
miles
across
the
country
to
the
tennessee
river
and
we
could
have
reached
it
ahead
of
any
opposition
had
we
all
stuck
together
one
man
had
a
compass
and
with
that
and
andrews
knowledge
of
the
country
we
could
have
gained
and
crossed
the
tennessee
and
struck
into
the
mountains
beyond
before
the
country
could
have
been
aroused
around
us
once
there
in
those
interminable
forests
it
would
have
been
almost
impossible
for
them
to
capture
us
well
armed
as
we
were
before
we
could
have
reached
the
shelter
of
our
army
but
this
was
not
done
and
this
last
chance
of
escape
was
lost
the
locomotive
was
run
on
till
the
wood
and
water
were
completely
exhausted
and
the
pursuers
plainly
in
view
then
andrews
gave
the
order
for
us
to
leave
the
train
disperse
and
for
every
man
to
save
himself
if
he
could
we
obeyed
jumping
off
the
train
while
still
in
motion
and
were
soon
making
the
best
of
our
way
through
the
tangled
pines
of
georgia
before
giving
an
account
of
our
adventures
in
the
woods
i
will
insert
the
following
article
from
the
of
april
a
paper
published
in
atlanta
georgia
only
three
days
after
our
adventure
this
i
purloined
from
the
officer
in
charge
of
us
and
carried
concealed
about
my
clothes
all
the
time
i
remained
in
the
south
it
contains
a
good
many
errors
of
statement
particularly
where
it
refers
to
our
numbers
and
plans
but
is
valuable
as
showing
the
estimate
the
rebels
placed
on
our
enterprise
and
as
giving
their
ideas
of
the
chase
it
also
represents
us
as
tearing
up
the
railroad
many
more
times
than
we
did
in
did
they
take
up
rails
behind
and
lay
them
down
before
their
train
this
assertion
was
made
to
give
fuller
and
murphy
more
credit
at
our
expense
so
highly
were
the
services
of
these
gentlemen
appreciated
that
the
georgia
state
legislature
in
the
fall
of
gave
them

the

most
extraordinary

of

some
reflections
full
particulars
since
our
last
issue
we
have
obtained
full
particulars
of
the
most
thrilling
railroad
adventure
that
ever
occurred
on
the
american
continent
as
well
as
the
mightiest
and
most
important
in
its
results
if
successful
that
has
been
conceived
by
the
lincoln
government
since
the
commencement
of
this
war
nothing
on
so
grand
a
scale
has
been
attempted
and
nothing
within
the
range
of
possibility
could
be
conceived
that
would
fall
with
such
a
tremendous
crushing
force
upon
us
as
the
accomplishment
of
the
plans
which
were
concocted
and
dependent
on
the
execution
of
the
one
whose
history
we
now
proceed
to
narrate
its
was
actually
excels
all
the
extravagant
of
the
hoax
which
fiction
created
such
a
profound
sensation
in
europe
to
make
the
matter
more
complete
and
intelligible
we
will
take
our
readers
over
the
same
history
of
the
case
which
we
related
in
our
last
the
main
features
of
which
are
correct
but
are
lacking
in
details
which
have
since
come
to
hand
we
will
begin
at
the
of
the
big
shanty
hotel
at
camp
mcdonald
on
the
western
and
atlantic
railroad
where
several
regiments
of
soldiers
are
now
encamped
the
morning
mail
and
passenger
train
had
left
here
at
four
on
last
saturday
morning
as
usual
and
had
stopped
there
for
breakfast
the
conductor
william
fuller
the
engineer
cain
both
of
this
city
and
the
passengers
were
at
the
table
when
some
eight
men
having
uncoupled
the
engine
and
three
empty
next
to
it
from
the
passenger
and
mounted
the
engine
pulled
open
the
valve
put
on
all
steam
and
left
conductor
engineer
passengers
spectators
and
the
soldiers
in
the
camp
hard
by
all
lost
in
amazement
and
dumbfounded
at
the
strange
startling
and
daring
act
this
act
was
doubtless
undertaken
at
that
place
and
time
upon
the
presumption
that
pursuit
could
not
be
made
by
an
engine
short
of
kingston
some
thirty
miles
above
or
from
this
place
and
that
by
cutting
down
the
telegraph
wires
as
they
proceeded
the
adventurers
could
calculate
on
at
least
three
or
four
hours
start
of
any
pursuit
it
was
reasonable
to
expect
this
was
a
legitimate
conclusion
and
but
for
the
will
energy
and
quick
good
judgment
of
fuller
and
cain
and
anthony
murphy
the
intelligent
and
practical
foreman
of
the
wood
department
of
the
state
road
shop
who
accidentally
went
on
the
train
from
this
place
that
morning
their
calculations
would
have
worked
out
as
originally
contemplated
and
the
results
would
have
been
obtained
long
ere
this
reaches
the
eye
of
our
readers
the
most
terrible
to
us
of
any
that
we
can
conceive
as
possible
and
unequaled
by
any
attempted
or
conceived
since
this
war
commenced
now
for
the
chase
these
three
determined
men
without
a
moment
delay
put
out
after
the
flying
train
amidst
shouts
of
laughter
by
the
crowd
who
though
lost
in
amazement
at
the
unexpected
and
daring
act
could
not
repress
their
risibility
at
seeing
three
men
start
after
a
train
on
foot
which
they
had
just
witnessed
depart
at
lightning
speed
they
put
on
all
their
speed
and
ran
along
the
track
for
three
miles
when
they
came
across
some
who
had
a
small
which
is
shoved
along
by
men
so
employed
on
railroads
on
which
to
carry
their
tools
this
truck
and
men
were
at
once
impressed
they
took
it
by
turns
of
two
at
a
time
to
run
behind
this
truck
and
push
it
along
all
up
grades
and
level
portions
of
the
road
and
let
it
drive
at
will
on
all
the
down
grades
a
little
way
further
up
the
fugitive
adventurers
had
stopped
cut
the
telegraph
wires
and
torn
up
the
track
here
the
pursuers
were
thrown
off
pell
mell
truck
and
men
upon
the
side
of
the
road
fortunately
nobody
was
hurt
on
our
side
the
truck
was
soon
placed
on
the
road
again
enough
hands
were
left
to
repair
the
track
and
with
all
the
power
of
determined
will
and
muscle
they
pushed
on
to
etowah
station
some
twenty
miles
above
here
most
fortunately
major
cooper
old
coal
engine
the
yonah
one
of
the
first
engines
on
the
state
road
was
standing
out
fired
up
this
venerable
locomotive
was
immediately
turned
upon
her
own
track
and
like
an
old
racer
at
the
tap
of
the
drum
pricked
up
her
ears
and
made
fine
time
to
kingston
the
fugitives
not
expecting
such
early
pursuit
quietly
took
in
wood
and
water
at
cass
station
and
borrowed
a
schedule
from
the
upon
the
plausible
plea
that
they
were
running
a
pressed
train
loaded
with
powder
for
beauregard
the
attentive
and
patriotic
william
russell
said
he
gave
them
his
schedule
and
would
have
sent
the
shirt
off
his
back
to
beauregard
if
it
had
been
asked
for
here
the
adventurous
fugitives
inquired
which
end
of
the
switch
they
should
go
in
on
at
kingston
when
they
arrived
at
kingston
they
stopped
went
to
the
agent
there
told
the
powder
story
readily
got
the
went
on
the
upper
and
waited
for
the
down
freight
train
to
to
all
inquiries
they
replied
with
the
same
powder
story
when
the
freight
train
had
passed
they
immediately
proceeded
on
to
the
next
station
adairsville
where
they
were
to
meet
the
down
freight
at
some
point
on
the
way
they
had
taken
on
some
fifty
and
before
reaching
adairsville
they
stopped
on
a
curve
tore
up
the
rails
and
put
seven
on
the
track
no
doubt
intending
to
wreck
this
down
freight
train
which
would
be
along
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
out
upon
the
engine
a
red
handkerchief
as
a
kind
of
flag
or
signal
which
in
railroading
means
another
train
is
behind
thereby
indicating
to
all
that
the
regular
passenger
train
would
be
along
presently
they
stopped
a
moment
at
adairsville
and
said
fuller
with
the
regular
passenger
train
was
behind
and
would
wait
at
kingston
for
the
freight
train
and
told
the
conductor
thereon
to
push
ahead
and
meet
him
at
that
point
they
passed
on
to
calhoun
where
they
met
the
down
passenger
train
due
here
at
and
without
making
any
stop
they
proceeded
on
on
and
on
but
we
must
return
to
fuller
and
his
party
whom
we
have
unconsciously
left
on
the
old
yonah
making
their
way
to
kingston
arriving
there
and
learning
the
adventurers
were
but
twenty
minutes
ahead
they
left
the
yonah
to
blow
off
while
they
mounted
the
engine
of
the
rome
branch
road
which
was
ready
fired
up
and
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
passenger
train
nearly
due
when
it
would
have
proceeded
to
rome
a
large
party
of
gentlemen
volunteered
for
the
chase
some
at
acworth
altoona
kingston
and
other
points
taking
such
arms
as
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
at
the
moment
and
with
this
fresh
engine
they
set
out
with
all
speed
but
with
great
care
and
caution
as
they
had
scarcely
time
to
make
adairsville
before
the
down
freight
train
would
leave
that
point
sure
enough
they
discovered
this
side
of
adairsville
three
rails
torn
up
and
other
impediments
in
the
way
they
took
up
in
time
to
prevent
an
accident
but
could
proceed
with
the
train
no
further
this
was
most
vexatious
and
it
may
have
been
in
some
degree
disheartening
but
it
did
not
cause
the
slightest
relaxation
of
efforts
and
as
the
result
proved
was
but
little
in
the
way
of
the
pluck
and
resolutions
of
fuller
and
murphy
who
left
the
engine
and
again
out
on
foot
after
running
two
miles
they
met
the
down
freight
train
one
mile
out
from
adairsville
they
immediately
reversed
the
train
and
ran
backwards
to
adairsville
put
the
cars
on
the
siding
and
pressed
forward
making
fine
time
to
calhoun
where
they
met
the
regular
down
passenger
train
here
they
halted
a
moment
took
on
board
a
telegraph
operator
and
a
number
of
men
who
again
volunteered
taking
their
guns
along
and
continued
the
chase
fuller
also
took
on
here
a
company
of
to
repair
the
track
as
they
went
along
a
short
distance
above
calhoun
they
their
on
a
curve
where
they
doubtless
supposed
themselves
out
of
danger
and
were
quietly
oiling
the
engine
taking
up
the
track
discovering
that
they
were
pursued
they
mounted
and
sped
away
throwing
out
upon
the
track
as
they
went
along
the
heavy
they
had
prepared
themselves
with
this
was
done
by
breaking
out
the
end
of
the
hindmost
and
pitching
them
out
thus
nip
and
tuck
they
passed
with
fearful
speed
resaca
tilton
and
on
through
dalton
the
rails
which
they
had
taken
up
last
they
took
off
with
them
besides
throwing
out
upon
the
track
occasionally
hoping
thereby
the
more
surely
to
impede
the
pursuit
but
all
this
was
like
tow
to
the
touch
of
fire
to
the
now
excited
and
eager
pursuers
these
men
though
so
much
excited
and
influenced
by
so
much
determination
still
retained
their
caution
were
looking
out
for
this
danger
and
discovered
it
and
though
it
was
seemingly
an
insuperable
obstacle
to
their
making
any
headway
in
pursuit
was
quickly
overcome
by
the
genius
of
fuller
and
murphy
coming
to
where
the
rails
were
torn
up
they
stopped
tore
up
rails
behind
them
and
laid
them
down
before
till
they
had
passed
over
that
obstacle
when
the
were
reached
they
hauled
to
and
threw
them
off
and
thus
proceeded
and
under
these
difficulties
gained
on
the
frightened
fugitives
at
dalton
they
halted
a
moment
fuller
put
off
the
telegraph
operator
with
instructions
to
telegraph
to
chattanooga
to
have
them
stopped
in
case
he
should
fail
to
overhaul
them
fuller
pressed
on
in
hot
chase
sometimes
in
sight
as
much
to
prevent
their
cutting
the
wires
before
the
message
could
be
sent
as
to
catch
them
the
daring
adventurers
stopped
just
opposite
and
very
near
to
where
colonel
regiment
is
encamped
and
cut
the
wires
but
the
operator
at
dalton
put
the
message
through
about
two
minutes
they
also
again
tore
up
the
track
cut
down
a
telegraph
pole
and
placed
the
two
ends
of
it
under
the
and
the
middle
over
the
rail
on
the
track
the
pursuers
stopped
again
and
got
over
this
impediment
in
the
same
manner
they
did
before
taking
up
the
rails
behind
and
laying
them
down
before
once
over
this
they
shot
on
and
passed
through
the
great
tunnel
at
tunnel
hill
being
there
only
five
minutes
behind
the
fugitives
thus
finding
themselves
closely
pursued
uncoupled
two
of
the
from
the
engine
to
impede
the
progress
of
the
pursuers
fuller
hastily
coupled
them
to
the
front
of
his
engine
and
pushed
them
ahead
of
him
to
the
first
or
siding
where
they
were
left
thus
preventing
the
collision
the
adventurers
intended
thus
the
passed
ringgold
where
they
began
to
fag
they
were
out
of
wood
water
and
oil
their
rapid
running
and
inattention
to
the
engine
had
melted
all
the
brass
from
the
journals
they
had
no
time
to
repair
or
refit
for
an
of
more
bottom
was
close
behind
fuller
and
murphy
and
their
men
soon
came
within
four
hundred
yards
of
them
when
the
fugitives
jumped
from
the
engine
and
left
it
three
on
the
north
side
and
five
on
the
south
side
all
fleeing
precipitately
and
scattering
through
the
thicket
fuller
and
his
party
also
took
to
the
woods
after
them
some
gentleman
also
well
armed
took
the
engine
and
some
cars
of
the
down
passenger
train
at
calhoun
and
followed
up
fuller
and
murphy
and
their
party
in
the
chase
but
a
short
distance
behind
and
reached
the
place
of
the
stampede
but
a
very
few
moments
after
the
first
pursuers
did
a
large
number
of
men
were
soon
mounted
armed
and
scouring
the
country
in
search
of
them
fortunately
there
was
a
militia
muster
at
ringgold
a
great
many
countrymen
were
in
town
hearing
of
the
chase
they
put
out
on
foot
and
on
horseback
in
every
direction
in
search
of
the
daring
but
now
thoroughly
frightened
and
fugitive
men
we
learn
that
fuller
soon
after
leaving
his
engine
in
passing
a
cabin
in
the
country
found
a
mule
having
on
a
bridle
but
no
saddle
and
tied
to
a
fence
your
he
shouted
as
he
leaped
upon
his
back
and
put
out
as
fast
as
a
good
switch
well
applied
could
impart
vigor
to
the
muscles
and
accelerate
the
speed
of
the
patient
donkey
the
cry
of
here
your
mule
and
where
my
mule
have
become
national
and
are
generally
heard
when
on
the
one
hand
no
mule
is
about
and
on
the
other
when
no
one
is
hunting
a
mule
it
seems
not
to
be
understood
by
any
one
though
it
is
a
peculiar
confederate
phrase
and
is
as
popular
as
dixie
from
the
potomac
to
the
rio
grande
it
remained
for
fuller
in
the
midst
of
this
exciting
chase
to
solve
the
mysterious
meaning
of
this
national
or
phrase
and
give
it
a
practical
application
all
of
the
eight
men
were
captured
and
are
now
safely
lodged
in
jail
the
particulars
of
their
capture
we
have
not
received
this
we
hope
to
obtain
in
time
for
a
postscript
to
this
or
for
our
second
edition
they
confessed
that
they
belonged
to
lincoln
army
and
had
been
sent
down
from
shelbyville
to
burn
the
bridges
between
here
and
chattanooga
and
that
the
whole
party
consisted
of
nineteen
men
eleven
of
whom
were
dropped
at
several
points
on
the
road
as
they
came
down
to
assist
in
the
burning
of
the
bridges
as
they
went
back
when
the
morning
freight
train
which
left
this
city
reached
big
shanty
maddox
and
phillips
took
the
engine
and
a
few
cars
with
fifty
picked
men
well
armed
and
followed
on
as
rapidly
as
possible
they
passed
over
all
difficulties
and
got
as
far
as
calhoun
where
they
learned
the
fugitives
had
taken
the
woods
and
were
pursued
by
plenty
of
men
with
the
means
to
catch
them
if
it
were
possible
one
gentleman
who
went
upon
the
train
from
calhoun
who
has
furnished
us
with
many
of
these
particulars
and
who
by
the
way
is
one
of
the
most
experienced
railroad
men
in
georgia
says
too
much
praise
can
not
be
bestowed
on
fuller
and
murphy
who
showed
a
cool
judgment
and
forethought
in
this
extraordinary
affair
unsurpassed
by
anything
he
ever
knew
in
a
railroad
emergency
this
gentleman
we
learn
from
another
offered
on
his
own
account
one
hundred
dollars
reward
on
each
man
for
the
apprehension
of
the
villains
we
do
not
know
what
governor
brown
will
do
in
this
case
or
what
is
his
custom
in
such
matters
but
if
such
a
thing
is
admissible
we
insist
upon
fuller
and
murphy
being
promoted
to
the
highest
honors
on
the
road
if
not
by
actually
giving
them
the
highest
position
at
least
let
them
be
promoted
by
certainly
their
indomitable
energy
and
quick
correct
judgment
and
decision
in
the
many
difficult
contingencies
connected
with
this
emergency
has
saved
all
the
railroad
bridges
above
ringgold
from
being
burned
the
most
daring
scheme
that
this
revolution
has
developed
has
been
thwarted
and
the
tremendous
results
which
if
successful
can
scarcely
be
imagined
much
less
described
have
been
averted
had
they
succeeded
in
burning
the
bridges
the
enemy
at
huntsville
would
have
occupied
chattanooga
before
sunday
night
yesterday
they
would
have
been
in
knoxville
and
thus
had
possession
of
all
east
tennessee
our
forces
at
knoxville
greenville
and
cumberland
gap
would
ere
this
have
been
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
lynchburg
virginia
would
have
been
moved
upon
at
once
this
would
have
given
them
possession
of
the
valley
of
virginia
and
stonewall
jackson
could
have
been
attacked
in
the
rear
they
would
have
possession
of
the
railroad
leading
to
charlottesville
and
orange
court
house
as
well
as
the
south
side
railroad
leading
to
petersburg
and
richmond
they
might
have
been
able
to
unite
with
mcclellan
forces
and
attack
jo
johnston
army
front
and
flank
it
is
not
by
any
means
improbable
that
our
army
in
virginia
would
have
been
defeated
captured
or
driven
out
of
the
state
this
week
then
reinforcements
from
all
the
eastern
and
southeast
portion
of
the
country
would
have
been
cut
off
from
beauregard
the
enemy
have
huntsville
now
and
with
all
these
designs
accomplished
his
army
would
have
been
effectually
flanked
the
mind
and
heart
shrink
appalled
at
the
awful
consequences
that
would
have
followed
the
success
of
this
one
act
when
fuller
murphy
and
cain
started
from
big
shanty
foot
to
capture
that
fugitive
they
were
involuntarily
laughed
at
by
the
crowd
serious
as
the
matter
was
and
to
most
observers
it
was
indeed
most
ludicrous
but
footrace
saved
and
prevented
the
consummation
of
these
tremendous
consequences
one
fact
we
must
not
omit
to
mention
is
the
valuable
assistance
rendered
by
peter
bracken
the
engineer
on
the
down
freight
train
which
fuller
and
murphy
turned
back
he
ran
his
engine
fifty
and
a
half
miles
two
of
them
backing
the
whole
freight
train
up
to
adairsville
made
twelve
stops
coupled
to
the
two
cars
which
the
fugitives
had
dropped
and
switched
them
off
on
sidings
all
this
one
hour
and
five
we
doubt
if
the
victory
of
manasses
or
corinth
were
worth
as
much
to
us
as
the
frustration
of
this
grand
d
it
is
not
by
any
means
certain
that
the
annihilation
of
beauregard
whole
army
at
corinth
would
be
so
fatal
a
blow
to
us
as
would
have
been
the
burning
of
the
bridges
at
that
time
and
by
these
men
when
we
learned
by
a
private
telegraph
dispatch
a
few
days
ago
that
the
yankees
had
taken
huntsville
we
attached
no
great
importance
to
it
we
regarded
it
merely
as
a
dashing
foray
of
a
small
party
to
destroy
property
tear
up
the
road
morgan
when
an
additional
telegram
announced
the
federal
force
there
to
be
from
to
we
were
inclined
to
doubt
though
coming
from
a
perfectly
honorable
and
upright
gentleman
who
would
not
be
apt
to
seize
upon
a
wild
report
to
send
here
to
his
friends
the
coming
to
that
point
with
a
large
force
where
they
would
be
flanked
on
either
side
by
our
army
we
regarded
as
a
most
stupid
and
unmilitary
act
we
now
understand
it
all
they
were
to
move
upon
chattanooga
and
knoxville
as
soon
as
the
bridges
were
burnt
and
press
on
into
virginia
as
far
as
possible
and
take
all
our
forces
in
that
state
in
the
rear
it
was
all
the
deepest
laid
scheme
and
on
the
grandest
scale
that
ever
emanated
from
the
brains
of
any
number
of
yankees
combined
it
was
one
that
was
also
entirely
practicable
on
almost
any
day
for
the
last
year
there
were
but
two
miscalculations
in
the
whole
programme
they
did
not
expect
men
to
start
out
afoot
to
pursue
them
and
they
did
not
expect
these
pursuers
on
foot
to
find
major
cooper
old
yonah
standing
there
all
ready
fired
up
their
calculations
on
every
other
point
were
dead
certainties
and
would
have
succeeded
perfectly
this
would
have
eclipsed
anything
captain
morgan
ever
attempted
to
think
of
a
parcel
of
federal
soldiers
officers
and
privates
coming
down
into
the
heart
of
the
confederate
states
for
they
were
here
in
atlanta
and
at
marietta
some
of
them
got
on
the
train
at
marietta
that
morning
and
others
were
at
big
shanty
of
playing
such
a
serious
game
on
the
state
road
which
is
under
the
control
of
our
prompt
energetic
and
sagacious
governor
known
as
such
all
over
america
to
seize
the
passenger
train
on
his
road
right
at
camp
mcdonald
where
he
has
a
number
of
georgia
regiments
encamped
and
run
off
with
it
to
burn
the
bridges
on
the
same
road
and
to
go
safely
through
to
the
federal
lines
all
this
would
have
been
a
feather
in
the
cap
of
the
man
or
men
who
executed
it
let
this
be
a
warning
to
the
railroad
men
and
everybody
else
in
the
confederate
states
let
an
engine
never
be
left
alone
a
moment
let
additional
guards
be
placed
at
our
bridges
this
is
a
matter
we
specially
urged
in
the
confederacy
long
ago
we
hope
it
will
now
be
heeded
further
let
a
sufficient
guard
be
placed
to
watch
the
government
stores
in
this
city
and
let
increased
vigilance
and
watchfulness
be
put
forth
by
the
watchmen
we
know
one
solitary
man
who
is
guarding
a
house
in
this
city
which
contains
a
lot
of
bacon
two
or
three
men
could
throttle
and
gag
him
and
set
fire
to
the
house
at
any
time
and
worse
he
conceives
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
a
guard
as
he
is
sometimes
seen
off
duty
for
a
few
moments
fully
long
enough
for
an
incendiary
to
burn
the
house
he
watches
let
shakelford
whom
we
know
to
be
watchful
and
attentive
to
his
duties
take
the
responsibility
at
once
of
placing
a
guard
of
sufficient
force
around
every
house
containing
government
stores
let
this
be
done
without
waiting
for
instructions
from
richmond
one
other
thought
the
press
is
requested
by
the
government
to
keep
silent
about
the
movements
of
the
army
and
a
great
many
things
of
the
greatest
interest
to
our
people
it
has
in
the
main
patriotically
complied
we
have
complied
in
most
cases
but
our
judgment
was
against
it
all
the
while
the
plea
is
that
the
enemy
will
get
the
news
if
it
is
published
in
our
papers
now
we
again
ask
what
the
use
the
enemy
get
what
information
they
want
they
are
with
us
and
pass
among
us
almost
daily
they
find
out
from
us
what
they
want
to
know
by
passing
through
our
country
unimpeded
it
is
nonsense
it
is
folly
to
deprive
our
own
people
of
knowledge
they
are
entitled
to
and
ought
to
know
for
fear
the
enemy
will
find
it
out
we
ought
to
have
a
regular
system
of
passports
over
all
our
roads
and
refuse
to
let
any
man
pass
who
could
not
give
a
good
account
of
himself
come
well
vouched
for
and
make
it
fully
appear
that
he
is
not
an
enemy
and
that
he
is
on
legitimate
business
this
would
keep
information
from
the
enemy
far
more
effectually
than
any
reticence
of
the
press
which
ought
to
lay
before
our
people
the
full
facts
in
everything

for
a
moment
my
heart
sunk
within
me
i
was
alone
for
no
one
happened
to
strike
off
in
the
same
direction
i
did
i
knew
not
where
i
was
whether
fifteen
or
fifty
miles
from
chattanooga
neither
had
i
the
most
indefinite
idea
of
the
lay
of
the
country
i
only
knew
that
north
or
northwest
would
bring
me
to
our
forces
but
the
sun
did
not
shine
to
give
me
even
the
points
of
the
compass
the
description
of
places
and
distances
given
in
the
preceding
chapter
was
mostly
obtained
from
confederates
who
afterward
visited
and
talked
with
us
i
supposed
that
the
country
would
be
aroused
and
a
vigorous
pursuit
made
but
my
worst
anticipations
proved
far
short
of
the
reality
it
was
saturday
the
of
april
and
was
a
general
for
the
conscripts
over
the
whole
country
but
as
soon
as
the
news
of
our
raid
was
received
drill
was
suspended
and
every
one
turned
out
in
search
of
us
then
was
organized
the
most
stupendous
that
ever
took
place
in
the
south
horsemen
hurried
at
full
speed
along
every
road
and
proclaimed
the
news
as
they
went
each
planter
with
his
dependents
for
at
least
fifty
miles
in
every
direction
took
his
bloodhounds
and
scoured
the
woods
every
every
river
ford
or
ferry
was
at
once
picketed
by
bodies
of
cavalry
large
rewards
were
offered
and
thousands
of
soldiers
pursued
us
in
addition
to
the
universal
uprising
of
the
citizens
the
only
partially
known
object
of
the
expedition
imparted
a
tone
of
romantic
exaggeration
to
it
and
made
the
people
doubly
anxious
to
solve
the
mystery
the
feeling
in
northern
georgia
may
be
best
conceived
by
imagining
what
would
be
the
excitement
in
the
immediate
vicinity
if
a
party
of
confederates
would
seize
a
train
near
philadelphia
and
attempt
to
run
it
through
baltimore
especially
if
the
movements
of
their
armies
should
be
such
as
would
lead
to
the
belief
that
this
was
only
of
a
grand
scheme
i
will
now
give
a
personal
sketch
of
my
own
adventures
after
leaving
the
train
it
was
still
moving
when
i
jumped
off
fast
enough
to
make
me
perform
several
inconvenient
gyrations
on
reaching
the
ground
most
of
the
party
were
ahead
of
me
three
had
taken
the
eastern
side
of
the
road
and
the
remainder
the
opposite
side
i
followed
the
example
of
the
latter
and
soon
reached
the
cover
of
the
stunted
pines
that
grew
near
the
road
feeling
the
necessity
of
getting
away
as
far
as
possible
before
the
enemy
could
pursue
us
on
foot
i
struck
off
at
a
rapid
rate
soon
i
passed
the
little
brook
that
ran
along
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
pressed
on
up
its
steep
side
there
were
three
of
my
comrades
not
far
from
me
on
the
left
but
i
could
not
overtake
them
and
still
proceeded
alone
i
knew
that
pursuit
would
be
rapid
and
instantaneous
i
seemed
to
hear
the
tread
of
cavalry
in
every
breeze
that
sighed
through
the
branches
of
the
naked
forest
the
country
was
rough
and
uneven
on
the
bottoms
and
by
the
streams
were
a
few
pines
but
on
the
mountain
spurs
which
here
are
a
low
continuation
of
the
cumberland
range
the
timber
is
mostly
oak
and
other
varieties
which
were
not
then
in
foliage
this
was
a
great
disadvantage
because
it
left
no
hiding
place
and
exposed
us
to
the
view
of
the
watchful
eyes
of
our
enemies
soon
i
found
myself
in
the
bend
of
a
little
river
that
empties
into
the
tennessee
at
chattanooga
it
was
swollen
by
continuous
rains
and
for
some
time
i
searched
along
its
bank
for
a
place
to
cross
the
turbulent
stream
but
seeing
none
and
believing
that
death
was
behind
i
committed
myself
to
its
angry
current
and
after
being
thoroughly
soaked
and
almost
washed
away
i
succeeded
in
reaching
the
opposite
side
here
the
bank
rose
in
an
almost
perpendicular
precipice
of
more
than
a
hundred
feet
in
hight
i
dared
not
recross
the
stream
for
i
knew
the
enemy
could
not
be
far
behind
and
therefore
i
clambered
up
the
precipice
several
times
when
near
the
top
did
i
feel
my
grasp
giving
way
but
as
often
did
some
bush
or
projecting
rock
afford
me
the
means
of
saving
myself
at
last
after
the
most
imminent
danger
i
reached
the
top
utterly
exhausted
pulled
myself
out
of
sight
and
breathed
for
a
while
i
had
had
no
breakfast
or
dinner
and
had
spent
not
only
that
day
but
many
preceding
ones
in
the
most
fatiguing
exertion
i
was
very
faint
and
sick
and
almost
out
of
hope
i
had
no
guide
even
in
the
direction
of
home
for
the
sun
still
lingered
behind
an
impenetrable
veil
while
i
thus
lay
and
mused
on
the
unenviable
situation
in
which
i
found
myself
placed
a
sound
reached
my
ears
that
again
sent
the
blood
leaping
wildly
through
my
veins
it
was
the
distant
baying
of
a
bloodhound
never
again
will
i
read
the
story
of
human
beings
of
any
color
pursued
by
these
revolting
instruments
of
man
most
savage
inhumanity
to
man
with
indifference
i
started
to
my
feet
and
a
few
moments
listening
confirmed
my
first
impression
it
was
true
they
were
after
us
with
their
bloodhounds
not
one
pack
alone
but
all
in
the
country
as
the
widening
circle
from
which
echoed
their
dismal
baying
revealed
but
too
plainly
there
was
no
longer
safety
in
idleness
and
i
at
once
started
up
and
hurried
off
as
nearly
at
right
angles
to
the
railroad
as
i
could
ascertain
by
the
whistling
of
the
trains
which
seemed
to
be
moving
in
great
numbers
and
much
excited
the
fearful
barking
of
the
dogs
also
gave
me
a
clue
to
avoid
them
faint
and
weak
as
i
was
excitement
supplied
the
place
of
strength
and
i
rapidly
placed
a
considerable
distance
between
myself
and
pursuers
away
across
the
hills
and
streams
i
sped
i
knew
not
how
far
i
only
knew
that
the
noise
of
the
dogs
grew
fainter
and
fainter
as
the
evening
wore
on
i
had
distanced
them
and
began
to
breathe
freer
i
even
indulged
the
hope
of
being
able
ultimately
to
work
my
way
to
the
lines
and
still
think
i
might
have
done
so
had
the
weather
been
clear
enough
to
permit
my
traveling
by
the
sun
or
stars
as
i
descended
the
long
slope
of
a
wooded
hill
into
a
wild
solitary
valley
i
saw
a
rude
hut
and
a
man
in
the
garden
beside
it
i
approached
him
to
inquire
the
road
to
chattanooga
though
that
was
the
last
place
i
wished
to
go
the
answer
was
that
it
was
only
eight
miles
this
was
nearer
than
i
liked
to
be
as
i
rightly
judged
the
pursuit
would
be
most
vigorous
in
that
vicinity
however
i
continued
my
journey
in
that
direction
until
out
of
sight
and
then
climbed
up
the
hill
at
right
angles
to
my
former
course
i
traveled
this
way
for
some
time
when
an
incident
occurred
that
would
have
been
amusing
had
it
been
less
vexatious
i
had
often
heard
that
persons
who
were
lost
would
naturally
travel
in
a
circle
but
did
not
attach
a
great
deal
of
credit
to
the
assertion
now
i
had
the
proof
i
had
crossed
a
road
and
left
it
for
something
like
an
hour
during
which
time
i
walked
very
fast
when
to
my
surprise
i
came
to
the
same
place
again
i
was
considerably
annoyed
to
thus
lose
my
labor
but
struck
over
the
hill
in
what
i
supposed
to
be
the
right
direction
judge
of
my
astonishment
when
after
an
hour
or
more
of
hard
walking
i
found
myself
at
precisely
the
same
spot
again
so
much
time
had
been
lost
that
i
now
could
hear
the
bloodhounds
once
more
i
was
perplexed
beyond
measure
a
few
steps
further
brought
me
to
the
i
had
crossed
hours
before
in
sheer
desperation
i
took
the
first
road
i
came
to
and
followed
it
a
long
time
almost
regardless
of
where
it
should
lead
or
whom
i
should
meet
thus
i
pressed
forward
till
twilight
was
deepening
into
darkness
when
i
met
a
negro
driving
a
team
from
him
i
learned
that
i
was
within
four
miles
of
chattanooga
words
can
not
describe
the
tide
of
vexation
disappointment
and
anger
that
swept
over
my
breast
when
i
found
that
in
spite
of
my
most
determined
efforts
i
was
steadily
approaching
the
lion
mouth
but
it
was
no
use
to
give
way
to
despair
learning
from
the
negro
the
direction
of
both
ringgold
and
chattanooga
i
resolved
to
make
an
effort
to
reach
the
tennessee
river
some
eight
or
ten
miles
below
chattanooga
for
this
purpose
i
struck
across
the
fields
in
the
proper
course
for
some
time
now
i
did
well
enough
but
before
long
i
came
to
a
large
field
of
deadened
timber
when
i
had
crossed
this
i
was
again
completely
lost
soon
however
i
reached
a
road
which
seemed
to
lead
right
which
i
followed
with
renewed
vigor
for
several
miles
at
last
i
met
three
men
on
horseback
it
was
too
dark
to
tell
whether
they
were
negroes
or
white
men
but
i
ventured
to
ask
them
how
far
is
it
to
chattanooga
miles
is
this
the
road
yes
sah
i
had
afterwards
reason
to
believe
that
these
were
men
sent
out
to
arrest
us
and
that
they
did
not
stop
me
just
because
i
was
going
right
to
chattanooga
but
it
was
evident
that
i
was
again
on
the
wrong
road
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
i
was
so
hopelessly
bewildered
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
travel
any
the
wrong
road
as
soon
as
the
horsemen
got
out
of
sight
i
turned
and
followed
them
three
or
four
miles
when
i
came
to
a
large
road
running
at
right
angles
with
my
own
which
terminated
where
it
joined
the
other
i
deliberated
for
some
time
as
to
which
end
of
this
new
road
i
should
take
i
had
no
guide
to
direct
me
for
my
old
road
was
too
crooked
even
to
give
me
the
direction
of
the
dreaded
chattanooga
many
a
time
have
i
wished
for
a
sight
of
the
moon
and
stars
long
before
the
clash
of
arms
was
heard
in
our
land
before
the
thunder
and
the
wailing
of
battle
had
filled
a
nation
with
weeping
have
i
waited
and
wished
for
the
parting
away
of
the
tedious
clouds
that
with
my
telescope
i
might
gaze
on
the
wonders
and
beauties
of
the
worlds
above
but
never
did
i
bend
a
more
anxious
eye
to
the
darkened
firmament
than
in
my
solitary
wanderings
over
the
georgia
hills
that
memorable
night
but
all
in
vain
no
north
star
appeared
to
point
with
beam
of
hope
to
the
land
of
the
free
at
length
i
started
off
on
the
road
that
i
thought
most
likely
to
lead
me
in
the
right
direction
but
as
usual
i
had
the
misfortune
of
being
wrong
for
after
i
had
gone
a
long
distance
the
moon
broke
through
a
rift
in
the
clouds
and
for
a
moment
poured
her
light
down
on
the
dark
forest
through
which
i
was
passing
that
one
glance
was
enough
to
show
me
that
i
was
heading
back
toward
the
railroad
i
had
left
in
the
morning
wearily
i
turned
and
retraced
my
tedious
steps
one
of
my
feet
had
been
injured
by
an
accident
three
mouths
before
and
now
pained
me
excessively
still
i
dragged
myself
along
my
nerves
had
become
completely
exhausted
by
the
tension
they
had
sustained
and
now
played
me
many
fantastic
tricks
which
became
more
vivid
as
the
night
waned
away
i
passed
the
place
where
i
had
made
the
wrong
choice
of
roads
and
still
toiled
on
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
now
i
was
thinly
clad
and
as
the
wind
which
was
blowing
quite
hard
drove
the
falling
showers
against
me
my
teeth
chattered
and
i
shivered
to
the
bone
i
passed
many
houses
and
feared
the
barking
of
the
dogs
might
betray
me
to
watchers
within
but
my
fears
were
groundless
the
storm
which
was
then
howling
fearfully
through
the
trees
served
to
keep
most
of
those
who
sought
our
lives
within
doors
even
the
barking
of
the
bloodhounds
was
heard
but
seldom
and
then
far
in
the
distance
i
seemed
to
have
the
lonely
fearful
stormy
night
to
myself
at
last
all
thoughts
gave
way
to
the
imperative
necessity
of
repose
i
reeled
to
a
large
log
that
lay
by
the
side
of
the
road
on
the
edge
of
a
small
patch
of
woodland
and
crawling
close
under
the
side
of
it
not
for
shelter
from
the
driving
rain
but
for
concealment
from
my
human
foes
i
slept
in
peace
up
to
this
time
the
image
of
that
terrible
night
is
graven
on
my
memory
with
a
scorching
pen
of
fire
after
this
it
changes
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
real
incidents
that
aroused
me
from
my
trance
it
floats
before
me
in
more
than
the
voluptuous
splendor
of
an
the
cause
of
this
change
is
a
curious
chapter
in
mental
philosophy
it
was
no
doubt
purely
physical
resulting
from
want
of
sleep
fatigue
dampness
lack
of
food
and
intense
mental
exertion
but
let
me
narrate
facts
when
i
awoke
it
was
with
a
full
realization
of
my
position
but
in
addition
to
this
i
seemed
to
hear
some
one
whisper
as
plainly
as
ever
i
heard
human
voice
shoot
him
shoot
him
let
us
shoot
him
before
he
wakes
my
first
impression
was
that
a
party
of
rebels
had
discovered
my
and
were
about
to
murder
me
in
my
sleep
to
save
themselves
further
trouble
but
the
next
thought
brought
a
new
suspicion
and
i
cautiously
opened
my
eyes
to
test
it
and
see
if
my
senses
were
really
playing
false
directly
before
me
stood
a
small
tree
the
first
glance
showed
a
tree
and
nothing
more
the
next
showed
a
score
of
angels
all
clad
in
softest
outlines
their
heads
nodding
with
feathery
plumes
above
all
beauty
and
their
wings
slowly
waving
with
borders
of
violet
and
pearl
the
whole
forest
was
suddenly
transformed
into
a
paradise
of
radiant
glory
in
which
moved
celestial
beings
of
every
order
all
instinct
with
life
blushing
with
love
and
bending
their
kindest
regards
on
me
ladies
too
were
there
fairer
than
ever
walked
the
fields
of
earth
embowered
in
roses
little
cherubs
with
laughing
faces
on
cloudlets
of
amber
and
gold
floated
around
indeed
all
that
the
imagination
could
conceive
of
beauty
was
comprised
in
that
one
gorgeous
glorious
vision
the
most
singular
fact
of
all
was
that
although
the
brain
and
eye
were
thus
impressed
with
that
which
had
no
real
existence
i
was
perfectly
calm
and
knowing
the
whole
thing
to
be
but
a
pleasing
illusion
i
did
not
in
the
least
fear
these
figures
of
the
brain
but
on
the
contrary
found
them
pleasant
company
not
always
however
did
they
personate
the
same
characters
occasionally
they
would
change
to
the
old
feudal
knights
sometimes
on
horseback
sometimes
on
foot
but
always
clad
in
glittering
armor
the
finest
landscapes
would
start
up
from
the
cold
dull
hills
around
like
mirages
in
the
desert
panoramas
of
the
most
vivid
action
passed
before
me
even
language
was
not
denied
to
my
visitants
whose
voices
were
inexpressibly
melodious
every
thought
that
passed
through
my
mind
seemed
sounded
audibly
at
my
side
thus
through
the
visions
of
night
and
darkness
i
passed
rapidly
on
for
now
i
felt
refreshed
and
endowed
with
new
strength
even
the
merciless
pelting
of
the
cold
rain
seemed
pleasant
and
luxurious
as
a
cool
bath
in
the
parching
heats
of
harvest
but
beyond
these
illusions
another
faculty
seemed
to
penetrate
and
show
me
though
but
dimly
the
true
face
of
the
country
once
the
two
became
mingled
and
very
nearly
involved
me
in
a
serious
difficulty
at
a
a
considerable
distance
ahead
i
saw
what
i
at
first
supposed
to
be
some
more
of
my
spectral
friends
standing
around
a
fire
the
ruddy
blaze
of
which
served
to
render
them
clearly
visible
they
were
not
quite
so
beautiful
as
those
i
had
seen
before
but
still
i
advanced
carelessly
toward
them
and
would
probably
have
continued
to
do
so
until
too
late
for
retreat
had
not
my
progress
been
arrested
by
a
sound
of
all
others
the
least
romantic
it
was
the
squealing
of
a
pig
they
had
caught
and
were
killing
preparatory
to
roasting
in
the
fire
this
at
once
drove
away
the
seraphs
and
the
angels
and
left
me
in
full
possession
of
my
faculties
i
listened
and
soon
became
convinced
that
they
were
a
picket
sent
out
there
to
watch
for
just
such
persons
as
myself
they
had
some
dogs
with
them
which
fortunately
were
too
much
absorbed
in
the
dying
agonies
of
the
poor
pig
to
give
attention
to
me
i
crawled
cautiously
away
and
made
a
long
circuit
through
the
fields
a
dog
made
himself
exceedingly
annoying
by
following
and
barking
after
me
i
did
not
apprehend
danger
from
him
for
i
yet
had
my
trusty
revolver
and
had
managed
to
keep
it
dry
all
the
time
but
i
feared
he
would
attract
the
attention
of
the
picket
who
might
easily
have
captured
me
for
i
was
too
weary
to
elude
them
at
last
he
left
me
and
i
again
returned
to
the
road
i
had
not
gone
far
till
i
came
to
three
horses
hobbled
down
which
no
doubt
belonged
to
the
picket
behind
and
had
to
make
another
circuit
to
avoid
driving
them
away
before
me
on
again
reaching
the
road
i
pressed
on
as
fast
as
possible
hoping
before
the
morning
light
to
be
beyond
the
circle
of
guarded
roads
and
the
line
of
planters
who
were
scouring
the
woods
with
their
dogs
it
was
a
vain
hope
but
i
knew
not
then
the
gigantic
plan
of
search
which
had
been
organized
the
visions
which
had
made
the
lonely
forest
almost
a
paradise
now
grew
dimmer
and
dimmer
the
roses
faded
and
all
the
forms
of
beauty
vanished
into
thin
air
the
chill
horror
of
my
situation
froze
deeper
into
my
veins
i
would
find
myself
walking
along
almost
asleep
then
would
wander
a
short
distance
from
the
road
to
a
secluded
spot
throw
myself
down
on
the
flooded
ground
and
sleep
a
few
minutes
then
would
awaken
almost
drowned
by
the
pitiless
rain
and
so
sore
and
benumbed
that
i
could
scarcely
stagger
to
my
feet
and
plod
onward
thus
that
dreary
night
wore
on
it
seemed
an
age
of
horror
and
placed
a
shuddering
gulf
between
my
present
life
and
the
past
but
at
last
the
cold
gray
of
a
clouded
morning
broke
through
the
weeping
sky
day
brought
no
relief
every
one
i
saw
seemed
to
be
a
foe
still
i
did
not
avoid
them
i
carefully
washed
all
traces
of
that
terrible
night
from
my
clothes
the
wet
did
not
matter
for
the
rain
was
still
falling
fast
enough
to
account
for
that
chapter

it
was

but
it
came
not
to
me
with
the
blessed
calmness
and
peace
that
accompany
it
in
my
own
sweet
ohio
i
saw
the
people
going
to
church
and
longed
to
go
with
them
but
dared
not
encounter
the
prying
eyes
that
would
have
greeted
a
stranger
even
if
i
had
wished
thus
to
loiter
on
my
journey
but
why
should
i
dwell
longer
on
this
dreary
morning
why
linger
over
its
miseries
deepened
by
the
faintness
of
the
hope
that
they
would
ever
cease
and
give
me
again
to
the
comfort
and
love
of
home
i
wandered
on
till
about
noon
when
i
was
observed
by
some
one
on
the
watch
for
strangers
this
was
just
beyond
lafayette
georgia
a
party
of
pursuit
was
at
once
organized
numbering
twenty
or
more
i
knew
nothing
of
my
danger
till
they
were
within
about
fifty
yards
of
me
when
they
ordered
me
to
stop
i
put
my
hand
on
my
pistol
and
looked
round
the
country
was
level
and
open
for
some
distance
and
i
was
too
weary
to
run
even
if
some
of
the
party
had
not
been
mounted
therefore
i
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
stopped
asking
what
they
wanted
they
replied
that
they
wanted
to
talk
with
me
awhile
soon
they
came
up
and
a
little
conceited
man
who
had
the
epaulets
of
a
lieutenant
but
whom
they
called
major
undertook
to
question
me
he
was
very
bland
about
it
and
apologized
hugely
for
interrupting
me
but
said
if
i
was
a
patriotic
man
as
he
had
no
doubt
i
was
i
would
willingly
undergo
a
slight
inconvenience
for
the
good
of
the
confederacy
i
endeavored
to
imitate
his
politeness
and
begged
him
to
proceed
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
assuring
him
that
he
would
find
nothing
wrong
he
then
searched
me
very
closely
for
papers
looking
over
my
money
and
pistol
but
found
nothing
suspicious
he
next
asked
me
who
i
was
where
i
came
from
and
where
i
was
going
i
told
him
that
i
was
a
citizen
of
kentucky
who
had
been
disgusted
with
the
tyranny
of
lincoln
and
was
ready
to
fight
against
it
that
i
came
to
chattanooga
but
would
not
enlist
at
that
place
because
most
of
the
troops
there
were
conscripts
and
the
few
volunteers
were
very
poorly
armed
i
told
him
all
about
where
i
had
been
in
chattanooga
and
the
troops
there
for
i
had
heard
a
good
deal
said
about
them
as
i
went
down
on
the
cars
to
marietta
on
the
previous
friday
evening
i
had
also
heard
them
praising
the
first
georgia
which
was
with
beauregard
and
now
told
the
major
that
i
wanted
to
join
it
he
then
asked
why
i
did
not
proceed
at
once
to
corinth
without
going
so
far
around
the
country
i
alleged
that
general
mitchel
was
in
the
way
at
huntsville
and
that
i
was
merely
making
a
circuit
far
enough
around
to
be
out
of
the
danger
of
capture
this
seemed
to
be
perfectly
satisfactory
to
the
little
man
and
turning
to
the
crowd
he
said
we
may
as
well
let
this
fellow
go
on
for
he
seems
to
be
all
right
these
words
rejoiced
me
but
my
joy
was
premature
a
man
who
sat
on
his
horse
with
his
hat
drawn
down
over
his
brows
raised
his
eyes
slowly
and
drawled
out
well
perhaps
we
as
well
take
him
back
to
town
and
if
right
maybe
we
can
help
him
on
to
corinth
this
was
rather
more
help
than
i
wanted
but
it
was
useless
to
demur
they
conducted
me
to
the
largest
hotel
in
the
place
where
i
was
received
very
kindly
soon
a
number
of
lawyers
came
in
and
commenced
asking
me
all
kinds
of
hard
questions
i
answered
as
well
as
i
could
when
i
told
them
i
was
from
kentucky
they
wished
to
know
the
county
i
told
them
fleming
then
they
asked
the
county
seat
this
also
i
was
able
to
give
but
when
they
required
me
to
give
the
counties
which
bounded
it
i
was
nonplussed
i
mentioned
a
few
at
random
but
suspect
most
of
them
were
wrong
they
said
it
looked
suspicious
to
find
a
man
who
could
not
bound
his
own
county
but
proceeded
in
their
examination
they
requested
a
narrative
of
my
journey
all
the
way
through
from
kentucky
this
i
gave
very
easily
as
long
as
it
was
on
ground
that
was
not
accessible
to
them
but
it
sorely
puzzled
me
to
account
for
the
time
i
had
been
on
the
railroad
and
for
the
last
night
which
i
spent
in
the
woods
i
had
to
families
with
whom
i
stayed
tell
the
number
of
children
and
servants
at
each
and
all
the
particulars
this
was
rather
perilous
as
many
of
my
auditors
knew
all
the
country
around
which
i
was
thus
fancifully
populating
but
i
had
no
alternative
i
might
have
refused
to
answer
at
all
but
this
would
have
been
construed
into
positive
proof
of
guilt
at
least
as
good
as
a
would
have
required
besides
i
still
had
a
faint
hope
that
they
might
be
induced
to
release
me
and
allow
me
to
continue
my
journey
as
it
was
my
assurance
puzzled
them
somewhat
and
they
held
numerous
private
consultations
but
while
they
were
thus
deliberating
over
my
case
and
could
only
agree
that
it
needed
further
investigation
a

with
foam
dashed
up
to
the
door
he
came
from
ringgold
and
brought
the
news
that
part
of
the
had
been
captured
and
that
they
had
at
first
pretended
to
be
of
kentucky
from
fleming
but
on
finding
that
this
did
not
procure
their
release
they
confessed
that
they
were
ohio
soldiers
sent
out
to
burn
the
bridges
on
the
georgia
state
road
the
remarkable
coincidence
of
their
first
story
with
the
one
i
had
been
trying
so
hard
to
make
the
rebels
believe
produced
a
marked
change
in
their
conduct
toward
me
they
at
once
adjourned
to
another
room
and
after
a
brief
consultation
agreed
to
commit
me
to
jail
to
await
further
developments
the
little
major
was
my
escort
he
first
purloined
my
money
then
took
me
to
the
county
jail
and
handed
me
over
to
the
jailor
this
personage
took
my
penknife
and
other
little
articles
then
led
me
up
stairs
unfastened
the
door
of
a
cage
of
crossing
iron
bars
in
which
was
one
poor
fellow
a
union
man
as
i
afterward
found
and
bade
me
enter
my
reflections
could
not
have
been
more
gloomy
if
the
celebrated
inscription
placed
over
the
gates
of
hell
had
been
written
above
the
massive
iron
door
all
hope
abandon
ye
who
enter
here
my
feelings
were
terrible
when
the
jailor
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
secured
the
heavy
iron
bar
that
crossed
the
door
and
left
me
never
before
had
i
been
locked
up
as
a
prisoner
and
now
it
was
no
trivial
matter
a
few
days
or
weeks
there
was
absolutely
no
hope
ahead
i
was
there
as
a
criminal
and
too
well
did
i
realize
the
character
of
the
southern
people
to
believe
that
they
would
be
fastidious
about
proof
life
is
held
too
cheap
in
that
country
to
cause
them
a
long
delay
in
its
disposal
in
that
hour
my
most
distressing
thought
was
of
my
friends
at
home
and
particularly
of
my
mother
thinking
what
would
be
their
sorrow
when
they
heard
of
my
ignominious
fate
if
indeed
they
ever
heard
for
i
had
given
an
assumed
name
that
all
my
young
hopes
and
ambitions
my
fond
dreams
of
being
useful
should
perish
as
i
then
had
no
doubt
they
would
on
a
southern
scaffold
seemed
unbearable
in
the
extreme
but
only
one
moment
did
these
thoughts
sweep
over
me
the
next
they
were
rejected
as
not
calculated
to
profit
in
the
least
my
first
action
was
to
borrow
from
my
union
companion
his
blankets
of
which
he
had
a
plentiful
supply
and
wrap
myself
in
them
the
warmth
they
produced
soon
threw
me
into
a
deep
sleep
profound
and
dreamless
such
as
only
extreme
fatigue
can
afford
i
awoke
hours
after
feeling
much
refreshed
but
did
not
at
first
realize
where
i
was
yet
a
glance
at
the
woven
bars
which
everywhere
bounded
me
in
brought
back
the
knowledge
that
i
was
a
prisoner
but
i
did
not
give
way
to
useless
despair
i
was
almost
amused
at
the
quaint
yet
truthful
remark
my
made
to
me
said
he
if
you
are
innocent
of
the
charge
they
have
against
you
there
is
no
hope
for
you
but
if
it
is
true
you
may
save
yourself
by
telling
what
regiment
and
company
you
belong
to
and
claiming
protection
as
a
united
states
prisoner
of
war
i
thought
a
good
deal
over
this
opinion
and
became
more
and
more
impressed
with
its
wisdom
it
contained
a
truth
that
i
could
not
gainsay
to
hang
a
poor
stranger
in
the
south
would
be
a
affair
only
what
was
often
done
by
the
southerners
before
the
war
began
in
fact
they
did
kill
a
man
at
dalton
under
circumstances
of
the
greatest
cruelty
because
he
cheered
as
we
dashed
through
the
town
afterward
they
found
out
that
the
man
was
as
good
a
rebel
as
any
of
them
and
had
merely
cheered
because
he
thought
we
too
were
rebels
then
they
set
the
matter
right
by
apologizing
to
his
friends
it
was
quite
different
in
the
case
of
our
soldiers
if
they
were
murdered
there
was
an
unpleasant
probability
that
some
of
the
chivalry
themselves
would
have
to
suffer
in
retaliation
besides
i
reflected
with
a
glow
of
hope
the
first
i
experienced
since
i
fell
into
their
hands
that
our
government
held
a
number
of
rebels
who
had
been
taken
in
missouri
on
a
similar
expedition
all
day
and
night
i
mused
on
these
things
and
endeavored
to
come
to
such
a
decision
as
would
be
for
the
best
when
i
heard
of
the
capture
of
many
of
our
party
and
the
announcement
of
the
regiments
to
which
they
belonged
showing
that
they
had
been
influenced
by
the
same
considerations
i
had
been
revolving
i
at
once
determined
to
rest
my
fate
on
my
claim
as
a
united
states
soldier
i
believe
that
this
decision
ultimately
saved
my
life
all
this
time
i
was
not
in
loneliness
throngs
of
georgians
came
in
to
see
the
caged
yankee
both
ladies
and
gentlemen
many
were
the
odd
remarks
they
made
criticising
every
feature
and
not
a
few
adding
every
possible
word
of
insult
the
whole
day
they
crowded
in
and
i
was
glad
when
the
approach
of
night
put
an
end
to
the
annoyance
the
coarse
food
the
jailor
brought
was
eaten
with
such
a
relish
as
hunger
only
can
impart
i
was
fortunate
in
respect
to
quantity
for
my
companion
was
not
well
and
could
not
eat
much
but
i
atoned
for
his
shortcoming
by
eating
both
of
our
allowances
without
difficulty
in
the
morning
they
took
me
before
a
committee
of
vigilance
these
committees
were
very
common
in
the
south
and
still
more
summary
in
their
modes
of
administering
justice
or
rather
vengeance
than
were
the
celebrated
vigilance
committees
of
san
francisco
in
the
early
history
of
the
gold
mines
they
were
prepared
with
a
board
of
the
most
eminent
lawyers
in
the
vicinity
and
no
doubt
hoped
to
entangle
me
still
more
deeply
in
the
meshes
of
contradiction
than
they
did
the
day
before
but
i
cut
the
whole
matter
short
by
saying
gentlemen
the
statements
i
gave
you
yesterday
were
intended
to
deceive
you
i
will
now
tell
you
the
truth
the
clerk
got
his
pen
ready
to
take
down
the
information
go
on
sir
go
on
said
the
president
i
am
ready
said
i
to
give
you
my
true
name
and
regiment
and
to
tell
you
why
i
came
into
your
country
just
what
we
want
sir
go
on
said
they
but
i
returned
i
will
make
no
statement
whatever
until
taken
before
the
regular
military
authority
of
this
department
this
took
them
by
surprise
and
they
used
every
threat
and
argument
in
their
power
to
induce
me
to
change
my
purpose
but
in
vain
my
reason
for
this
was
to
avoid
the
violence
of
mob
law
while
in
the
hands
of
the
populace
there
was
danger
of
the
summary
infliction
of
punishment
that
the
military
authorities
could
disavow
if
our
government
threatened
retaliation
but
if
i
was
once
under
the
regular
military
jurisdiction
they
would
be
responsible
both
to
the
united
states
and
to
the
civilized
world
when
they
found
that
i
would
tell
them
nothing
further
they
made
arrangements
to
take
me
to
chattanooga
which
was
distant
twenty
miles
it
was
the
same
to
ringgold
near
which
we
abandoned
the
train
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
in
that
long
and
terrible
night
i
had
traveled
twenty
miles
in
a
straight
line
and
with
my
meanderings
must
have
walked
fifty
i
was
remanded
to
the
jail
to
wait
for
the
preparation
of
a
suitable
escort
here
i
remained
till
after
dinner
when
i
was
guarded
by
about
a
dozen
men
to
the
public
square
a
carriage
was
in
waiting
in
which
i
was
placed
and
then
commenced
the
process
of
tying
and
chaining
a
great
mob
gathered
around
completely
filling
the
whole
square
and
was
exceedingly
angry
and
excited
they
questioned
me
in
loud
and
imperious
tones
demanding
why
i
came
down
there
to
fight
them
and
adding
every
possible
word
of
insult
i
heard
many
significant
hints
about
getting
ropes
and
the
folly
of
taking
me
down
to
chattanooga
when
i
could
be
hanged
just
as
well
there
however
as
the
mob
grew
more
violent
in
their
denunciations
i
selected
some
of
the
more
intelligent
ones
and
addressed
them
they
answered
with
curses
but
in
the
very
act
of
cursing
they
grew
milder
and
more
willing
to
converse
i
was
not
very
much
in
the
humor
for
talking
but
following
the
dictates
of
policy
rather
than
inclination
i
answered
their
innuendoes
merrily
and
soon
had
some
of
the
laughers
on
my
side
before
long
i
heard
some
of
them
say
pity
he
is
a
yankee
for
he
seems
to
be
a
good
fellow
this
was
gratifying
and
we
were
soon
ready
to
start
i
had
been
secured
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
a
heavy
chain
was
put
around
my
neck
and
fastened
by
a
padlock
the
other
end
was
hitched
to
one
foot
and
secured
in
the
same
manner
the
chain
being
extended
to
its
full
length
while
i
was
in
a
sitting
position
making
it
impossible
for
me
to
my
hands
were
tied
together
my
elbows
were
pinioned
to
my
side
by
ropes
and
to
crown
all
i
was
firmly
bound
to
the
carriage
seat
my
evil
genius
the
little
major
took
the
seat
beside
me
as
driver
he
was
armed
to
the
teeth
two
other
officers
on
horseback
likewise
fully
armed
constituted
the
rest
of
the
guard
that
was
thought
necessary
to
attend
one
chained
and
helpless
yankee
oh
spirit
of
chivalry
how
art
thou
fallen
no
longer
one
brave
southern
knight
a
match
for
eight
or
ten
northern
mudsills
but
three
officers
to
guard
one
chained
union
soldier
the
same
exaggerated
caution
i
frequently
noticed
afterward
there
seemed
to
be
a
perpetual
fear
on
the
minds
of
the
miscreants
that
we
were
about
to
do
something
desperate
as
we
journeyed
along
the
sky
which
for
days
had
been
overcast
and
during
that
time
had
hardly
afforded
us
a
glimpse
of
its
celestial
blue
became
suddenly
clear
the
sun
shone
out
in
beauty
and
smiled
on
the
first
faint
dawnings
of
spring
that
lay
in
tender
green
on
the
surrounding
hills
i
am
ever
very
sensitive
to
the
influences
of
nature
in
all
its
phases
and
now
felt
my
spirit
grow
more
light
as
i
breathed
the
fresh
air
and
listened
to
the
singing
of
the
birds
my
companions
were
quite
talkative
and
though
i
hated
them
for
the
indignity
they
had
thus
put
upon
me
in
chaining
me
as
a
criminal
yet
i
knew
it
would
be
unavailing
to
indulge
a
surly
and
vindictive
disposition
and
therefore
talked
as
fast
and
as
lively
as
they
could
my
guards
themselves
did
not
subject
me
to
any
insults
and
even
endeavored
to
prove
that
the
extraordinary
manner
in
which
i
was
bound
was
a
compliment
to
me
i
could
not
see
it
in
that
light
and
would
have
willingly
excused
the
tying
and
the
compliment
together
the
worst
was
that
when
they
passed
any
house
they
would
call
out
got
a
live
yankee
here
then
men
women
and
children
would
rush
to
the
door
and
stare
as
though
they
saw
some
great
monster
asking
whar
did
you
ketch
him
goin
to
hang
him
when
you
get
him
to
chattanooga
and
similar
expressions
without
end
this
was
only
amusing
at
first
but
its
perpetual
recurrence
soon
grew
terribly
wearisome
and
was
not
without
its
effect
in
making
me
believe
they
really
would
hang
me
in
fact
my
expectation
of
escaping
was
never
very
bright
yet
i
considered
it
my
duty
to
keep
up
my
spirits
as
well
as
i
could
and
not
despair
till
it
really
was
certain
that
there
remained
no
ground
for
hope
the
afternoon
wore
slowly
away
as
we
traveled
along
passing
some
very
grand
and
romantic
scenery
that
in
any
other
frame
of
mind
would
have
been
enthusiastically
enjoyed
but
now
my
thoughts
were
otherwise
engaged
it
was
not
the
thought
of
death
i
so
much
dreaded
as
the
manner
of
death
death
amid
the
smoke
and
excitement
and
glory
of
battle
was
not
half
so
terrible
as
in
the
awful
calmness
and
chill
horror
of
the
scaffold
and
sadder
yet
to
think
of
my
friends
who
would
count
the
weary
months
that
had
gone
by
and
wish
and
long
for
my
return
till
hope
became
torturing
suspense
and
suspense
deepened
into
despair
these
thoughts
were
almost
too
much
for
stoicism
yet
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
patiently
endure
the
sun
went
down
and
night
came
on
deep
calm
and
clear
one
by
one
the
stars
twinkled
into
light
i
gazed
upon
their
beauty
with
new
feelings
as
i
wondered
whether
the
short
revolving
course
of
a
few
more
suns
might
not
bring
me
a
dweller
above
the
stars
and
as
i
thought
of
the
blessed
rest
for
the
weary
beyond
the
shores
of
time
my
thoughts
took
a
new
direction
i
was
not
then
a
professor
of
christianity
but
had
often
and
believingly
thought
of
the
great
interests
of
the
future
and
had
resolved
to
make
them
my
particular
study
but
had
never
hitherto
addressed
myself
in
earnest
to
the
task
and
latterly
the
confusion
and
bustle
of
a
had
almost
driven
the
subject
out
of
my
mind
but
now
whether
it
came
from
the
clustering
stars
above
or
from
the
quiet
and
stillness
so
congenial
to
exhausted
nature
after
the
weariness
and
excitement
of
the
last
few
days
or
from
a
still
deeper
source
i
know
not
i
only
know
that
the
memory
of
that
night
when
i
was
thus
being
carried
chained
to
an
unknown
fate
is
one
of
the
sweetest
of
my
life
my
babbling
guards
had
subsided
into
silence
and
as
we
wended
along
through
the
gathering
darkness
high
and
noble
thoughts
of
the
destiny
of
man
filled
my
breast
and
death
seemed
only
the
shining
gate
to
eternal
and
blissful
life
i
was
nerved
for
any
fate
we
arrived
at
chattanooga
while
a
feeble
glow
of
the
soft
spring
twilight
still
lingered
on
the
earth
we
immediately
drove
to
the
headquarters
of
general
leadbetter
then
commanding
that
place
and
while
our
guards
ascended
to
inform
him
of
our
arrival
i
was
left
in
the
carriage
as
soon
as
we
entered
the
town
the
word
was
given
we
got
a
live
yankee
one
that
took
the
train
the
other
day
i
was
not
the
first
one
of
the
party
captured
but
was
the
first
brought
to
chattanooga
the
curiosity
to
see
one
of
the
men
who
had
frightened
women
and
children
into
the
woods
was
of
course
most
extreme
and
an
immense
crowd
soon
gathered
around
they
behaved
just
as
southern
mobs
usually
do
jeering
and
hooting
calling
me
by
every
epithet
of
reproach
the
language
afforded
and
wanting
to
know
why
i
came
down
there
to
burn
their
property
and
murder
them
and
their
children
to
these
multitudinous
questions
and
assertions
i
made
no
answer
i
was
greatly
amused
afterward
by
their
criticisms
on
my
appearance
one
would
say
that
it
was
a
pity
that
so
young
and
a
man
should
be
caught
in
such
a
scrape
another
of
more
penetrating
cast
could
tell
that
he
was
a
rogue
by
his
appearance
probably
came
out
of
prison
in
his
own
country
another
was
surprised
that
i
could
hold
up
my
head
and
look
around
on
honest
men
arguing
that
such
brazen
effrontery
was
a
proof
of
enormous
depravity
of
heart
i
did
not
give
my
opinion
on
the
subject
indeed
it
was
not
asked
there
was
one
man
i
noticed
in
particular
he
was
tall
and
had
gray
hair
gray
beard
a
magnificent
forehead
and
an
altogether
commanding
and
intellectual
expression
of
countenance
he
was
treated
with
great
deference
and
appeared
to
me
most
like
a
doctor
of
divinity
as
he
parted
his
way
through
the
crowd
toward
me
i
thought
surely
i
will
receive
some
sympathy
from
that
man
his
first
question
was
calculated
to
confirm
my
impression
said
he
how
old
are
you
i
answered
sir
gradually
his
lip
wreathed
itself
into
a
curl
of
unutterable
scorn
as
he
slowly
continued
poor
young
fool
and
i
suppose
you
was
a
or
something
of
that
kind
in
your
own
land
and
you
thought
you
would
come
down
here
and
rob
us
and
burn
our
houses
and
murder
us
did
you
now
let
me
give
you
a
little
advice
if
you
ever
get
home
again
but
you
never
will
do
try
for
god
sake
and
have
a
little
better
sense
and
stay
there
then
he
turned
contemptuously
on
his
heel
and
strode
away
while
the
rabble
around
rewarded
him
with
a
cheer
i
never
could
find
out
who
he
was
after
that
i
looked
no
more
for
sympathy
in
that
crowd
my
conductors
now
returned
and
escorted
me
into
the
presence
of
general
leadbetter
they
said
he
was
a
northern
man
but
if
so
it
is
very
little
credit
to
my
section
for
he
was
one
of
the
most
contemptible
individuals
i
ever
knew
he
was
a
perfect
sot
and
had
just
two
states
of
body
as
a
confederate
captain
afterwards
explained
to
us
these
were
dead
drunk
and
gentlemanly
drunk
he
oscillated
constantly
between
these
two
he
was
a
coward
as
well
and
though
only
a
managed
to
stay
as
far
away
from
the
field
when
the
fight
was
going
on
as
one
of
our
own
most
conspicuous
did
he
had
been
promoted
to
his
present
position
for
his
in
hanging
some
defenceless
east
tennessee
citizens
which
he
did
without
a
trial
all
these
facts
i
learned
afterward
except
one
which
was
apparent
when
i
entered
the
room
he
was
gentlemanly
drunk
he
commenced
questioning
me
and
i
told
him
partly
the
truth
and
partly
not
going
on
the
principle
that
truth
is
a
pearl
and
pearls
are
not
to
be
thrown
before
swine
i
told
him
that
i
was
a
united
states
soldier
giving
him
my
company
and
regiment
but
saying
that
i
was
detailed
without
my
consent
that
i
was
ignorant
of
where
i
was
going
and
what
i
was
to
perform
which
i
only
learned
as
fast
as
i
was
to
execute
it
he
wanted
to
know
our
intention
in
thus
seizing
the
engine
but
i
plead
ignorance
he
next
inquired
who
was
our
engineer
but
i
refused
to
tell
he
then
said
sir
i
want
you
to
tell
me
just
how
many
men
you
had
on
that
train
and
to
describe
them
so
i
may
know
when
i
get
them
i
answered
general
i
have
freely
told
you
whatever
concerns
only
myself
because
i
thought
it
better
that
you
should
know
that
i
am
a
soldier
under
the
protection
of
the
united
states
but
i
have
not
yet
become
base
enough
to
describe
my
comrades
o
sneered
he
i
do
know
that
i
ought
to
have
asked
you
that
i
think
not
sir
i
replied
well
said
he
i
know
all
about
it
your
leader
name
is
andrews
what
kind
of
a
man
is
he
i
was
perfectly
astonished
that
he
should
have
andrews
name
and
know
him
to
be
our
leader
but
i
never
imagined
what
i
afterward
found
to
be
the
true
cause
that
andrews
had
been
captured
and
had
given
his
name
with
the
fact
that
he
was
the
leader
of
the
expedition
i
had
every
confidence
that
would
get
away
and
try
some
measures
for
our
relief
so
i
answered
boldly
i
can
tell
you
only
one
thing
about
him
and
that
is
he
is
a
man
whom
you
will
never
catch
i
i
noticed
a
peculiar
smile
on
the
general
face
as
i
said
this
but
he
only
replied
that
will
do
for
you
and
turning
to
a
captain
who
stood
by
he
continued
take
him
to
the
hole
you
know
where
that
is
with
a
nod
in
reply
the
captain
took
me
out
of
the
room
as
i
passed
through
the
door
i
saw
an
explanation
of
the
general
smile
there
stood
andrews
ironed
waiting
an
audience
and
marion
ross
and
john
williams
with
him
i
did
not
choose
to
recognize
them
for
such
recognition
might
have
compromised
them
as
i
knew
not
what
course
they
would
pursue

the
captain
now
called
a
guard
of
eight
men
and
conducted
me
through
the
streets
for
some
time
at
last
we
came
to
a
little
brick
building
surrounded
by
a
high
board
fence
those
who
have
ever
been
in
chattanooga
and
visited
the
negro
prison
will
recognize
my
description
a
portion
of
the
building
was
occupied
by
the
jailor
but
the
prison
part
consisted
of
two
rooms
one
under
the
other
and
also
partly
underground
this
under
room
had
no
entrance
from
the
outside
but
was
accessible
only
through
a
from
the
room
directly
overhead
chattanooga
is
not
a
and
therefore
this
prison
was
built
only
for
the
accommodation
of
negroes
by
their
humane
owners
the
jailor
swims
was
a
character
and
merits
a
particular
description
he
was
an
old
man
perhaps
sixty
his
hair
which
was
very
abundant
was
white
as
snow
and
his
face
had
a
dry
and
withered
expression
his
voice
was
always
keyed
on
a
whining
tone
except
when
some
great
cause
such
as
the
demand
of
prisoners
for
an
extra
bucket
of
water
excited
him
and
then
it
rose
to
a
hoarse
scream
avarice
was
his
predominant
almost
his
only
characteristic
he
seemed
to
think
his
accommodations
were
vastly
too
good
for
negroes
and
yankees
and
that
when
they
were
admitted
within
his
precincts
they
should
be
thankful
and
give
as
little
trouble
as
possible
with
such
notions
it
was
not
wonderful
that
he
managed
to
make
the
lot
of
the
prisoner
an
uncomfortable
one
in
addition
to
this
he
was
very
fond
of
a
dram
and
frequently
became
sufficiently
intoxicated
to
reveal
many
important
matters
that
we
would
not
otherwise
have
learned
he
bustled
to
the
gate
growling
all
the
time
about
being
troubled
so
much
unlocked
it
and
admitting
us
led
us
up
the
outside
stairway
and
then
into
the
upper
room
i
now
saw
why
the
general
called
the
place
a
hole
and
truly
i
thought
the
name
was
appropriate
it
was
only
thirteen
feet
square
destitute
of
every
convenience
without
chairs
beds
or
anything
of
the
kind
there
were
in
it
five
or
six
old
men
who
had
not
been
washed
for
months
the
place
looked
hard
to
me
and
i
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
taking
up
my
abode
in
such
a
den
but
i
soon
found
that
i
was
not
to
enjoy
that
luxury
said
the
jailor
to
the
captain
where
shall
i
put
him
below
of
course
was
the
reply
the
jailor
then
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
taking
a
large
key
from
his
pocket
knelt
down
and
unlocked
two
rusty
locks
then
with
a
great
effort
raised
a
ponderous
just
at
my
feet
the
hot
air
and
the
stifling
stench
smote
me
back
but
the
bayonets
of
the
guards
were
just
behind
and
i
was
compelled
to
move
forward
again
a
long
ladder
was
next
thrust
down
through
the
and
the
inmates
warned
to
stand
from
under
a
mingled
volley
of
cries
oaths
and
questions
ascended
and
the
ladder
was
secured
the
captain
then
ordered
me
to
descend
into
what
seemed
more
like
pandemonium
than
any
place
on
earth
down
i
went
into
the
cimmerian
gloom
clambering
step
by
step
to
a
depth
of
fully
thirteen
feet
for
the
place
as
i
afterwards
learned
when
i
had
more
leisure
for
observation
was
a
cube
just
thirteen
feet
each
way
i
stepped
off
the
ladder
treading
on
human
beings
i
could
not
discern
and
crowding
in
as
best
i
might
illustration
down
i
went
into
the
cimmerian
gloom
clambering
step
by
step
to
a
depth
of
fully
thirteen
feet
page
the
heat
was
so
great
that
the
perspiration
broke
from
me
in
streams
the
foeted
air
made
me
for
a
time
deadly
sick
and
i
wondered
whether
it
could
be
possible
they
would
leave
human
beings
in
this
horrible
place
to
perish
the
thought
of
the
black
hole
at
calcutta
where
so
many
englishmen
died
rushed
over
me
true
this
was
done
by
the
cruel
and
savage
east
indians
while
we
were
in
the
hands
of
our
southern
brethern
the
chivalry
but
i
could
not
perceive
that
this
difference
of
captors
made
any
difference
of
treatment
my
breath
came
thick
and
heavy
and
i
thought
of
suffocation
the
ladder
was
drawn
up
and
with
a
dull
and
heavy
sound
that
seemed
crushing
down
on
my
heart
the
fell
i
wedged
and
jammed
my
way
through
the
living
throng
to
the
window
the
one
i
reached
was
just
under
the
wooden
stairs
and
of
course
gave
no
light
the
other
was
below
the
surface
of
the
ground
they
were
at
opposite
sides
of
the
room
and
were
only
about
a
foot
square
being
filled
with
a
triple
row
of
thick
set
iron
bars
that
almost
excluded
every
current
of
air
i
pressed
my
face
close
to
the
bars
and
breathed
the
purest
air
i
could
get
until
i
became
partly
reconciled
to
the
oppression
and
then
turned
to
ascertain
the
condition
of
my
companions
it
was
wretched
beyond
description
they
were
ragged
dirty
and
crawling
with
vermin
most
of
them
were
nearly
naked
but
this
was
no
inconvenience
there
for
it
was
so
warm
that
those
who
had
clothes
were
obliged
to
take
them
off
and
nearly
all
were
in
a
state
of
nudity
i
soon
found
it
necessary
myself
to
disrobe
and
even
then
the
perspiration
poured
off
me
most
profusely
it
was
an
atmosphere
of
death
yet
among
the
prisoners
were
old
men
just
trembling
on
the
verge
of
the
grave
who
were
arrested
merely
because
they
had
ventured
to
express
a
preference
for
the
old
government
over
the
new
confederacy
the
cruelty
practiced
on
the
tennessee
union
men
will
never
half
be
told
it
forms
the
darkest
page
in
the
history
of
the
war
in
every
prison
of
which
i
was
an
inmate
in
georgia
and
virginia
as
well
as
in
tennessee
i
found
these
miserable
but
patriotic
men
thus
heartlessly
immured
but
i
will
speak
more
of
them
hereafter
at
that
time
the
thought
of
my
own
danger
banished
every
other
consideration
there
were
fourteen
white
men
in
the
room
beside
myself
and
one
negro
i
wonder
what
those
tender
soldiers
who
consider
it
derogatory
to
their
dignity
to
fight
in
the
same
army
that
blacks
do
would
think
if
they
were
confined
with
them
so
closely
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
getting
away
but
we
endured
too
many
real
evils
to
fret
at
imaginary
ones
and
besides
aleck
was
so
kind
and
accommodating
so
anxious
to
do
everything
in
his
power
for
us
that
he
soon
became
a
general
favorite
and
when
he
was
taken
out
to
be
whipped
as
he
was
several
times
to
ascertain
whether
he
was
telling
a
true
story
or
not
we
could
not
help
feeling
the
sincerest
sympathy
for
him
the
southern
method
of
catching
stray
negroes
is
about
this
when
one
is
found
traveling
without
a
pass
he
is
arrested
taken
to
the
jail
and
severely
flogged
this
usually
brings
some
kind
of
a
confession
from
him
and
he
is
advertised
in
accordance
with
that
confession
if
no
answer
is
received
in
a
limited
time
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
he
lied
and
he
is
whipped
again
in
order
to
bring
a
new
confession
thus
they
continue
alternately
whipping
and
advertising
till
the
close
of
the
year
if
a
master
is
found
before
this
he
can
pay
the
costs
and
take
his
property
if
not
the
negro
is
sold
to
pay
the
jail
and
whipping
fees
no
trial
is
ever
allowed
at
which
the
negro
might
prove
himself
free
when
once
arrested
his
doom
is
sealed
and
in
this
way
many
free
negroes
are
enslaved
aleck
had
been
in
this
prison
seven
months
and
was
to
remain
five
more
with
no
other
prospect
than
that
of
being
sold
into
perpetual
bondage
every
society
has
its
aristocrats
and
here
i
soon
found
that
the
eminence
was
given
to
those
who
were
charged
with
the
most
daring
deeds
the
spy
there
was
but
one
so
accused
and
he
was
blind
was
considered
much
above
the
ordinary
union
men
i
was
charged
with
the
greatest
adventure
of
any
confined
there
and
of
course
was
treated
with
becoming
deference
the
rebels
thought
he
was
counterfeiting
blindness
but
i
believe
it
was
real
i
was
not
long
the
only
one
of
the
by
which
name
we
were
known
during
our
stay
in
the
confederacy
who
was
confined
in
this
dungeon
soon
the
again
opened
causing
a
stream
of
comparatively
cool
air
from
the
room
above
to
rush
down
it
was
an
inconceivable
relief
a
that
none
could
appreciate
who
had
not
as
we
had
been
deprived
of
that
greatest
blessing
god
has
given
to
man
pure
air
we
wondered
who
was
coming
next
as
the
feeble
glimmering
of
a
candle
above
revealed
several
forms
descending
the
tennesseeans
cried
out
do
put
any
more
down
here
we
full
we
die
if
more
are
put
down
which
did
not
seem
improbable
but
these
remonstrances
produced
no
effect
down
they
came
and
i
stationing
myself
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
spoke
something
indifferently
to
them
and
heard
my
name
called
in
return
it
was
andrews
wollam
and
ross
who
gave
me
their
hands
in
silent
condolence
of
our
common
misery
still
others
were
brought
i
do
not
now
remember
whether
that
evening
or
in
the
morning
again
the
door
was
closed
and
the
free
air
which
had
seemed
to
flow
to
us
in
sympathy
was
once
more
shut
out
we
tried
to
arrange
ourselves
to
secure
the
repose
we
so
much
needed
but
the
room
was
too
small
think
of
this
ye
who
sleep
on
your
downy
beds
at
home
here
were
your
brothers
of
ohio
not
only
compelled
to
sleep
on
the
bare
floor
but
not
even
enough
of
that
in
this
vilest
of
dens
on
which
to
lie
down
at
all
and
yet
some
of
you
sympathize
with
those
who
were
the
authors
of
this
cruelty
and
think
it
so
hard
that
their
property
should
be
confiscated
for
such
trifles
as
these
and
worst
of
all
that
their
negroes
should
be
taken
from
them
what
shall
we
think
of
we
did
the
best
we
could
some
found
room
to
lie
down
others
sat
against
the
wall
and
still
others
leaned
on
the
breasts
of
those
who
were
thus
supported
it
is
no
wonder
if
while
in
such
a
situation
we
should
be
afflicted
with
the
nightmare
and
have
innumerable
bad
dreams
if
any
one
wanted
to
move
his
position
or
go
for
a
drink
and
the
stifling
heat
rendered
us
all
very
thirsty
he
was
sure
to
tread
on
his
neighbors
and
tempers
being
naturally
very
short
here
some
warm
altercations
took
place
which
contributed
still
more
to
disturb
our
slumbers
the
next
morning
we
slept
late
indeed
as
long
as
we
remained
in
this
prison
we
were
inclined
to
sleep
much
the
great
quantity
of
carbonic
acid
gas
our
breathing
produced
seemed
to
act
as
an
opiate
and
thus
served
in
some
measure
to
deaden
the
sense
of
pain
we
were
aroused
the
next
morning
early
as
we
supposed
by
the
opening
of
the
door
above
and
the
delicious
shower
of
cool
air
that
fell
on
us
as
we
looked
up
we
saw
the
white
head
of
our
old
jailor
bending
over
and
saying
in
drawling
tones
boys
here
your
breakfast
and
down
he
lowered
a
bucket
by
a
rope
containing
a
very
small
piece
of
bread
and
the
same
of
meat
for
each
of
us
this
was
seized
and
devoured
almost
instantly
i
had
received
nothing
to
eat
since
breakfast
the
day
before
and
the
little
morsel
i
got
only
served
to
whet
my
appetite
but
there
was
no
more
we
asked
what
time
it
was
and
were
told
nine
we
were
also
informed
that
we
would
get
our
meals
only
twice
a
day
this
was
rather
discouraging
information
for
persons
as
hungry
as
ourselves
but
we
had
no
remedy
during
the
day
a
few
more
of
our
party
came
in
and
among
them
was
wilson
i
found
that
they
had
all
done
as
i
had
in
acknowledging
themselves
united
states
soldiers
influenced
by
the
same
reasons
and
most
of
them
sooner
than
myself
we
consulted
about
the
matter
and
concluded
that
the
only
hope
we
had
was
in
adhering
to
the
same
story
and
trying
to
make
them
believe
that
we
were
actually
detailed
without
our
consent
and
without
a
knowledge
of
what
we
had
to
do
this
was
true
for
part
but
not
for
all
or
even
for
the
most
of
us
we
agreed
to
conceal
the
name
of
the
engineer
at
all
hazards
the
fact
of
a
previous
expedition
being
sent
down
into
georgia
and
that
campbell
was
not
a
soldier
also
our
previous
acquaintance
with
andrews
thus
leaving
him
free
to
make
his
own
defense
with
the
exception
of
these
reserved
facts
which
were
not
even
to
be
whispered
among
ourselves
we
were
to
talk
freely
to
answer
all
questions
and
convey
the
impression
that
we
had
nothing
to
conceal
we
carried
out
this
idea
and
as
more
of
our
men
came
in
they
agreed
to
it
and
gave
without
reserve
their
true
names
companies
and
regiments
this
course
gained
us
sympathy
from
those
whose
bosoms
were
not
steeled
against
every
kindly
feeling
and
to
this
more
than
anything
else
i
attribute
the
fact
of
some
of
the
party
being
alive
we
afterward
communicated
our
plan
to
andrews
who
cordially
approved
it
saying
that
if
we
adhered
to
it
there
would
be
some
chance
for
our
lives
we
did
adhere
to
it
and
no
amount
of
persuasion
threatening
or
promises
could
induce
any
of
the
party
to
betray
one
of
our
reserved
secrets
the
rebels
were
particularly
anxious
to
discover
who
was
the
engineer
and
would
first
ask
the
question
in
the
most
careless
manner
then
afterward
would
sternly
demand
to
know
they
even
employed
a
man
who
was
a
freemason
to
visit
the
party
and
try
to
gain
the
confidence
of
one
of
our
number
who
belonged
to
that
order
and
subsequently
urge
him
to
tell
the
desired
name
under
the
sanction
of
the
masonic
oath
but
all
in
vain
as
others
of
our
party
joined
us
in
bands
of
two
or
three
they
told
the
story
of
their
capture
this
was
in
some
cases
most
thrilling
and
still
further
illustrates
the
fiendish
barbarities
of
the
rebels
two
of
them
parrott
and
robinson
who
were
captured
the
same
day
they
left
the
train
were
taken
to
ringgold
here
they
endeavored
to
compel
parrott
who
was
the
youngest
looking
of
the
party
to
betray
his
companions
and
particularly
the
engineer
but
he
refused
to
do
it
then
these
villains
in
confederate
uniform
stripped
him
naked
and
stretched
him
down
on
a
rock
four
men
holding
him
by
each
hand
and
foot
while
two
others
stood
by
with
loaded
revolvers
threatening
him
with
instant
death
if
he
offered
the
least
resistance
then
a
rebel
lieutenant
commenced
whipping
him
with
a
raw
hide
three
different
times
he
ceased
and
raised
parrott
up
asking
him
if
he
was
ready
to
confess
but
the
heroic
boy
refused
and
at
last
the
whipping
was
discontinued
after
more
than
a
hundred
lashes
had
been
inflicted
his
back
remained
sore
a
long
time
and
he
suffered
very
much
from
being
obliged
to
lie
on
the
hard
floor
they
did
not
apply
anything
to
his
wounds
to
heal
them
and
the
scars
still
remain
all
the
party
came
in
chained
but
of
course
expected
when
they
were
put
down
into
the
dungeon
and
a
dungeon
that
they
would
at
least
have
the
use
of
their
hands
but
this
was
too
great
an
indulgence
to
be
allowed
we
were
handcuffed
and
then
chained
together
by
the
neck
in
twos
and
threes
my
partner
was
william
reddick
to
whom
i
was
for
some
time
thus
chained
together
packed
into
a
little
cramped
dungeon
deprived
even
of
light
and
almost
of
air
crawled
over
by
all
kinds
of
vermin
for
there
were
innumerable
rats
mice
and
bugs
as
well
as
a
smaller
and
still
more
pestiferous
insect
we
presented
a
picture
of
nearly
perfect
misery
in
this
state
we
remained
almost
three
weeks
during
this
time
andrews
had
received
a
trial
the
evidence
was
strong
against
him
a
whiteman
whom
andrews
himself
had
directed
to
be
summoned
and
who
was
a
former
business
partner
of
his
testified
that
andrews
had
been
repeatedly
in
the
south
that
he
had
professed
allegiance
to
the
southern
confederacy
and
in
all
things
represented
himself
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
same
in
fact
he
had
passes
in
his
possession
when
he
was
captured
that
could
hardly
have
been
obtained
without
his
taking
the
oath
of
allegiance
this
did
much
to
sustain
the
charge
of
treason
against
him
as
he
admitted
being
the
leader
of
the
expedition
the
other
indictment
which
was
that
of
being
a
spy
was
not
supported
by
any
evidence
so
far
as
i
could
learn
but
this
was
of
no
importance
as
the
punishment
of
the
first
charge
was
death
however
the
sentence
was
not
then
given
and
andrews
lawyers
gave
him
some
reason
to
hope
that
there
was
an
informality
in
the
proceedings
which
would
render
the
whole
trial
void
all
this
time
we
were
most
intensely
anxious
to
know
how
military
affairs
were
progressing
in
the
world
without
i
had
appropriated
from
an
officer
in
charge
of
us
a
paper
containing
the
confederate
account
of
our
chase
which
has
been
given
before
and
also
an
admission
that
the
battle
of
shiloh
was
not
so
much
of
a
victory
as
they
had
at
first
supposed
we
managed
likewise
to
get
one
or
two
other
papers
which
gave
the
welcome
news
that
our
armies
were
still
pressing
onward
and
earnestly
did
we
wish
and
hope
that
chattanooga
would
be
reached
in
time
to
effect
our
deliverance
but
the
best
item
of
news
we
received
was
from
our
old
jailor
who
on
one
occasion
became
too
drunk
to
remember
the
orders
he
had
received
against
telling
us
anything
and
let
out
the
very
interesting
fact
that
general
mitchel
had
advanced
to
bridgeport
only
miles
below
us
on
the
tennessee
river
and
there
had
sorely
defeated
the
rebels
capturing
some
of
the
very
same
men
who
had
been
guarding
us
a
few
days
before
this
was
very
cheering
and
we
began
to
hope
that
we
too
would
soon
be
captured
the
officer
of
the
guard
was
obviously
uneasy
all
the
time
we
were
in
the
dungeon
we
had
been
guarded
by
men
with
a
captain
over
them
this
was
certainly
enough
to
keep
confined
and
chained
as
we
were
in
our
place
but
we
thought
it
would
be
a
capital
joke
should
they
be
captured
with
us
but
it
was
not
their
intention
to
let
us
fall
into
mitchel
hands
an
order
was
sent
to
the
captain
in
charge
to
prepare
us
for
moving
he
did
so
and
soon
after
we
were
in
the
cars
carried
down
the
same
road
we
came
up
so
rapidly
three
weeks
before
how
beautiful
all
nature
appeared
it
was
may
and
the
time
we
had
spent
without
one
glance
at
the
expansive
sky
or
green
earth
had
not
been
lost
in
the
material
world
the
landscape
had
been
robed
in
a
richer
verdure
the
budding
trees
had
swelled
into
leafy
screens
the
sky
was
of
a
softer
blue
the
birds
warbled
with
new
melody
and
everything
seemed
to
wear
its
holiday
dress
o
the
joy
the
gladness
of
being
once
more
under
the
canopy
of
heaven
and
of
looking
up
to
its
unfathomable
depths
with
no
envious
bars
to
obstruct
our
view
many
a
time
have
i
passed
the
month
of
may
amidst
the
most
romantic
scenery
but
never
yet
did
i
so
deeply
feel
that
this
is
indeed
a
pleasant
world
full
of
beauty
and
goodness
as
on
that
balmy
evening
when
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
glowing
from
the
west
streamed
over
the
grass
and
wheatfields
on
their
path
and
poured
in
mellowed
yellow
radiance
through
our
but
even
then
the
glories
of
earth
and
sky
could
not
make
me
forget
that
i
was
still
chained
to
my
companion
and
surrounded
by
guards
with
gleaming
bayonets
the
wild
excitement
caused
by
our
raid
had
not
subsided
in
the
least
and
as
it
became
known
that
we
were
passing
along
the
road
a
mob
greeted
us
at
every
station
it
is
not
necessary
to
again
describe
these
mobs
for
all
are
alike
and
one
description
answers
for
many
they
were
as
usual
rude
loquacious
and
insulting
when
we
arrived
in
atlanta
which
was
in
the
morning
there
was
no
for
us
but
before
going
further
we
were
obliged
to
wait
for
the
evening
train
when
it
became
known
in
the
city
that
we
were
there
a
mob
instantly
collected
and
prepared
to
hang
us
they
were
prevented
by
our
guard
probably
on
the
principle
that
a
mouse
is
protected
by
a
kitten
that
it
may
have
the
pleasure
of
first
playing
with
it
and
afterwards
killing
it
itself
during
the
progress
of
the
strife
between
those
who
wanted
to
hang
us
and
those
who
wanted
the
law
to
take
its
course
several
persons
were
severely
injured
but
while
the
disturbance
was
in
progress
one
man
succeeded
in
reaching
the
car
window
unnoticed
and
handed
us
a
paper
using
only
the
single
but
magical
word
a
friend
and
then
was
lost
in
the
throng
we
read
the
paper
by
snatches
as
the
attention
of
the
guard
was
directed
to
other
objects
and
found
it
to
contain
glorious
news
nothing
less
than
capture
of
new
orleans
by
our
need
i
say
that
for
the
time
all
thought
of
private
misfortune
was
lost
in
the
exhilaration
of
national
triumph
the
cause
of
secession
then
looked
gloomy
i
took
particular
pains
to
talk
with
the
officer
in
charge
of
us
and
other
intelligent
rebels
about
their
prospects
and
found
them
discouraged
our
captain
would
not
let
us
have
any
newspapers
or
give
us
any
information
yet
he
thought
it
no
harm
to
talk
with
us
on
the
great
subject
of
the
war
after
we
had
learned
the
facts
from
other
sources
frequently
by
pretending
to
know
we
could
get
from
him
a
full
idea
of
things
concerning
which
we
were
ignorant
before
of
this
character
was
mcclellan
advance
on
richmond
the
captain
admitted
that
he
was
moving
with
an
overwhelming
force
and
that
they
had
then
but
a
comparatively
small
army
to
resist
him
indeed
everything
looked
bright
for
the
union
cause
and
the
only
uneasiness
that
disturbed
us
was
the
apprehension
that
we
might
not
live
to
witness
that
happy
triumph
which
now
seemed
so
near
in
the
evening
we
glided
on
again
and
at
length
arrived
at
madison
this
is
a
flourishing
village
and
looked
well
as
we
entered
it
there
were
then
some
six
hundred
of
our
prisoners
confined
there
and
we
indulged
the
hope
that
we
might
be
put
with
them
but
we
soon
learned
that
the
brand
of
criminality
for
our
daring
adventure
still
rested
on
us
for
we
were
marched
past
the
dilapidated
cotton
factory
where
our
friends
were
confined
to
the
old
county
jail
which
was
then
entirely
unoccupied
it
was
a
gloomy
stone
building
and
had
two
rooms
but
both
had
doors
and
were
above
ground
of
the
upper
story
i
can
not
speak
as
our
party
was
divided
and
i
was
one
that
was
assigned
to
the
lower
apartment
the
room
was
very
dark
and
its
heavy
stone
walls
rendered
it
quite
damp
it
would
have
seemed
like
a
wretched
place
had
it
not
been
for
our
previous
experience
in
chattanooga
besides
we
were
now
further
from
the
influence
of
general
leadbetter
and
only
under
the
control
of
our
captain
who
showed
us
some
kindness
though
we
were
still
in
irons
the
citizens
of
the
place
were
freely
admitted
to
see
us
and
ranged
themselves
always
in
the
presence
of
the
guard
along
one
side
of
the
cell
and
talked
about
all
the
exciting
topics
of
the
day
they
pretended
to
admire
us
very
much
and
contrasted
our
daring
expedition
with
what
they
were
pleased
to
call
the
cowardice
of
the
yankees
generally
and
asked
if
there
were
any
more
like
us
in
the
army
wilson
of
cincinnati
assured
them
that
we
were
the
poorest
men
in
mitchel
division
and
only
sent
away
because
he
had
no
use
for
us
this
rather
astonished
them
but
from
the
way
in
which
mitchel
with
his
small
and
divided
force
was
controlling
northern
alabama
and
much
of
eastern
tennessee
as
well
as
defeating
them
at
all
points
they
were
rather
inclined
to
believe
it
but
among
these
visitors
was
one
who
came
not
for
mere
curiosity
he
was
dressed
in
rebel
uniform
but
was
instantly
recognized
by
andrews
as
a
in
the
service
of
the
united
they
had
no
opportunity
for
private
communication
but
our
situation
was
revealed
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
excite
suspicion
his
character
was
made
known
to
us
by
andrews
after
his
departure
and
while
we
were
wondering
at
his
audacity
and
rather
inclined
to
disbelieve
the
story
the
captain
of
the
guard
who
had
come
to
bring
supper
told
us
that
a
most
remarkable
occurrence
had
taken
place
that
afternoon
he
said
that
the
had
learned
from
some
source
that
a
spy
of
lincoln
had
been
among
our
visitors
and
had
at
once
sent
a
guard
to
arrest
him
the
guard
found
him
at
the
depot
just
as
the
cars
were
coming
in
the
stranger
was
very
indignant
at
his
arrest
and
told
them
scornfully
that
he
had
papers
in
his
pocket
that
would
prove
his
character
anywhere
they
were
somewhat
abashed
at
this
and
released
their
hold
on
him
but
asked
him
to
produce
the
papers
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
as
though
searching
for
them
and
fumbled
about
until
he
noticed
that
the
train
which
was
starting
had
attained
a
good
rate
of
speed
and
then
just
as
the
last
car
swung
by
he
dashed
from
them
and
jumped
aboard
there
was
no
telegraph
station
at
madison
and
he
escaped
at
this
the
confederates
were
very
much
enraged
and
would
permit
no
more
visiting
but
we
felt
ample
consolation
in
the
certainty
that
our
condition
would
be
at
once
reported
to
our
officers
and
every
effort
made
for
our
release

that

not

going

ordered

we
were

to
run

and
jeering
mobs
that
had
annoyed

we
traveled

by

our

who
had
never
been
a
very
warm
secessionist
and
therefore
had
no
very
hard
feelings
towards
us
had
become
quite
friendly
he
now
proved
this
by
interceding
in
our
behalf
and
procuring
us
permission
to
remain
in
the
upper
room
this
was
the
same
size
as
the
lower
one
but
it
had
three
windows
instead
of
two
and
these
were
larger
and
obscured
by
only
one
row
of
bars
but
the
poor
tennessee
union
men
had
to
go
below
it
was
amusing
to
see
the
exaggerated
caution
with
which
they
guarded
us
even
when
we
were
below
where
scarcely
any
man
could
have
got
out
without
assistance
they
never
raised
the
unprotected
by
a
strong
guard
now
when
we
were
in
the
upper
room
their
vigilance
was
still
further
increased
they
would
bring
a
guard
into
the
room
through
which
ours
was
entered
and
there
array
them
with
leveled
bayonets
into
two
lines
across
the
door
at
the
same
time
the
stairway
was
guarded
and
another
guard
always
surrounded
the
jail
outside
of
the
wall
and
even
the
old
jailor
would
fret
and
predict
that
evil
would
result
from
showing
the
yankees
so
much
indulgence
all
this
time
we
were
chained
and
as
the
authorities
were
thus
slow
in
relieving
us
of
what
we
believed
to
be
an
unnecessary
incumbrance
we
set
our
wits
to
work
to
free
ourselves
one
of
the
party
had
managed
to
secrete
a
small
knife
while
they
were
searching
him
and
with
this
made
rude
keys
from
the
bones
of
the
meat
given
us
and
in
a
short
time
opened
every
lock
we
could
not
of
course
appear
in
public
in
our
new
liberty
or
more
effectual
means
of
fastening
would
probably
have
been
devised
to
avoid
detection
we
kept
some
one
always
on
the
watch
then
when
any
person
was
heard
approaching
our
room
a
signal
was
given
and
a
quick
rattling
of
chains
accompanied
the
adjustment
and
of
our
bands
when
the
door
opened
we
would
be
chained
all
right
and
as
soon
as
it
closed
we
would
be
free
again
we
continued
this
deception
during
our
stay
in
this
prison
and
were
never
detected
while
here
we
relieved
the
tedious
time
that
hung
heavily
on
our
hands
by
mock
trials
we
would
charge
one
of
the
company
with
some
offence
generally
a
trifling
breach
of
our
prison
rules
and
proceed
to
trial
campbell
whose
immense
personal
strength
better
enabled
him
to
inflict
the
punishment
that
would
be
awarded
usually
officiated
as
judge
until
at
last
he
got
the
name
of
judge
firmly
fixed
on
him
these
trials
produced
much
sport
we
had
ample
time
for
it
and
the
opposing
counsel
would
make
very
long
and
learned
speeches
so
interesting
were
these
arguments
and
so
eloquent
our
appeals
that
no
one
of
the
auditors
was
ever
known
to
leave
the
house
while
they
were
in
progress
the
witnesses
too
were
very
slippery
and
it
was
sometimes
quite
difficult
to
reconcile
their
testimony
there
were
always
some
nullifiers
present
who
would
attempt
to
resist
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
and
the
infliction
of
the
penalties
adjudged
but
in
these
cases
the
of
the
judge
decided
the
matter
this
resistance
would
give
rise
to
new
arrests
and
trials
and
thus
the
work
became
interminable
another
and
more
refined
enjoyment
was
singing
there
were
several
good
singers
in
the
party
and
by
practicing
together
they
soon
acquired
great
proficiency
most
of
the
songs
were
of
a
tender
and
melancholy
cast
such
as
the
carrier
dove
do
they
miss
me
at
home
nettie
more
twenty
years
ago
our
time
for
singing
was
when
twilight
began
to
fall
then
in
the
gathering
darkness
the
voice
of
song
would
ring
out
as
glad
and
free
as
if
it
was
not
strained
through
prison
bars
the
guards
liked
very
much
to
hear
us
sing
and
frequently
citizens
of
the
town
would
gather
round
outside
to
listen
to
the
caged
yankees
there
is
one
man
in
the
confederacy
whom
i
must
praise
amid
the
worthless
and
boastful
aristocrats
who
have
monopolized
for
themselves
the
name
of
chivalry
i
found
gentleman
this
was
colonel
claiborne
at
that
time
of
chattanooga
when
he
first
visited
us
he
said
boldly
that
it
was
a
shame
to
keep
men
in
such
a
condition
and
tried
in
vain
to
get
permission
from
general
leadbetter
to
remove
our
irons
he
then
ordered
us
to
be
brought
into
the
yard
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
every
afternoon
this
was
an
inexpressible
relief
for
it
was
now
intensely
hot
in
our
room
and
simply
to
be
in
the
open
air
a
short
time
was
a
luxury
above
all
price
this
he
did
on
his
own
responsibility
and
some
weeks
afterward
was
dismissed
from
his
post
on
account
of
his
humanity
to
us
while
here
the
idea
of
escape
frequently
presented
itself
it
is
true
that
our
guards
outnumbered
us
and
always
used
the
cautions
i
have
described
above
but
the
very
fear
this
argued
would
have
been
our
best
help
we
often
discussed
the
subject
among
ourselves
all
were
anxious
to
go
but
ross
and
wilson
who
thought
the
proposition
premature
as
they
relying
on
what
the
officers
in
charge
of
us
said
believed
that
there
was
some
hope
of
our
exchange
but
others
of
us
were
impatient
to
make
one
bold
effort
for
our
own
deliverance
two
plans
were
proposed
the
first
which
i
suggested
was
to
have
all
our
irons
off
when
the
guards
came
up
to
feed
us
and
then
as
the
door
opened
to
make
a
simultaneous
rush
on
the
leveled
bayonets
outside
wrest
the
arms
from
their
owners
and
pour
down
stairs
on
the
guard
below
as
soon
as
we
had
secured
the
arms
of
the
remainder
we
could
leave
the
in
a
solid
body
and
pass
on
to
the
which
lay
on
our
side
of
the
river
not
far
distant
once
over
the
river
and
thus
armed
we
would
have
been
comparatively
safe
the
other
plan
which
we
finally
agreed
to
adopt
was
proposed
by
andrews
it
was
that
some
one
should
secrete
himself
under
the
bed
in
the
jailor
room
when
we
were
coming
up
from
our
breathing
in
the
yard
and
remain
there
till
all
was
quiet
at
night
then
come
out
and
noiselessly
unlock
the
door
after
this
we
could
rush
down
seize
the
guard
and
proceed
as
in
the
first
plan
there
were
two
of
our
party
who
failed
to
reach
the
place
of
rendezvous
in
time
to
be
with
us
on
the
train
one
was
from
the
the
other
from
the
second
ohio
regiment
they
were
suspected
and
to
save
themselves
were
compelled
to
join
a
rebel
battery
which
they
did
representing
themselves
as
brothers
from
kentucky
in
the
battle
at
bridgeport
in
which
the
secessionists
were
so
badly
the
one
from
the
found
an
opportunity
to
escape
to
general
mitchel
this
caused
suspicion
to
rest
on
his
supposed
brother
who
was
arrested
brought
to
chattanooga
and
confined
in
the
dungeon
while
we
were
there
we
recognized
him
and
talked
though
very
cautiously
about
his
adventures
he
asked
us
not
to
divulge
the
fact
that
he
was
one
of
us
an
unnecessary
request
he
remained
there
for
some
time
and
was
finally
released
and
put
into
the
battery
again
from
which
by
a
wonderful
series
of
adventures
he
succeeded
in
making
good
his
escape
to
our
lines
at
this
time
there
was
a
great
talk
of
exchange
a
son
of
general
mitchel
had
been
captured
but
he
also
held
a
considerable
number
of
prisoners
and
it
was
believed
that
an
exchange
would
be
effected
a
lieutenant
whom
mitchel
had
released
on
parole
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
kirby
smith
at
that
time
commanding
the
department
of
east
tennessee
and
obtaining
his
consent
to
an
exchange
visited
us
his
story
raised
the
most
sanguine
hopes
the
confederate
officers
however
said
that
it
would
be
first
necessary
to
have
a
trial
and
prove
that
we
were
really
united
states
soldiers
and
then
we
too
would
be
embraced
in
the
exchange
andrews
some
time
before
wanted
to
send
a
flag
of
truce
through
the
lines
to
get
from
our
officers
a
statement
of
our
true
character
but
they
refused
permission
saying
that
they
could
believe
our
own
story
on
the
subject
without
going
to
so
much
trouble
the
prospect
of
an
exchange
served
to
defer
our
attempted
escape
but
at
last
we
resolved
to
wait
no
longer
the
very
day
we
came
to
this
conclusion
an
order
was
given
to
send
twelve
to
knoxville
for
trial
a
mere
formal
one
as
the
commander
of
the
guard
and
the
marshal
told
us
to
clearly
prove
that
we
were
an
authorized
military
expedition
and
not
mere
citizen
adventurers
george
wilson
was
in
the
yard
when
the
order
came
he
was
permitted
to
be
down
there
because
he
was
very
sick
the
officer
of
the
guard
handed
him
the
order
asking
him
to
select
twelve
to
go
as
no
names
were
mentioned
he
did
so
selecting
all
his
own
regiment
second
ohio
first
and
afterward
his
special
friends
from
the
other
regiments
because
he
thought
it
would
be
a
favor
to
them
that
they
would
probably
be
first
exchanged
this
unexpected
order
induced
us
to
abandon
our
cherished
scheme
of
escape
which
in
all
probability
judging
from
the
result
of
a
subsequent
attempt
under
far
more
unfavorable
circumstances
would
have
been
completely
successful
as
we
twelve
who
were
to
go
to
knoxville
prepared
for
our
departure
we
felt
a
shade
of
gloom
fall
over
our
spirits
our
little
band
who
had
for
nearly
two
months
been
companions
in
dangers
and
privations
such
as
few
men
ever
experienced
was
now
to
be
divided
and
we
knew
not
where
we
should
unite
again
for
in
spite
of
their
fair
words
the
remained
that
we
were
in
the
power
of
that
enemy
who
has
deluged
our
land
in
blood
with
andrews
the
parting
was
peculiarly
affecting
we
had
been
accustomed
to
look
up
to
him
in
all
emergencies
he
was
our
leader
and
was
the
particular
mark
for
the
vengeance
of
the
foe
officers
in
bidding
us
hope
spoke
no
words
of
comfort
to
him
he
bore
this
like
a
hero
as
he
was
and
continued
to
hope
against
hope
but
after
we
had
sung
our
songs
together
for
the
last
time
and
come
to
bid
him
farewell
we
were
moved
even
to
tears
i
will
never
forget
his
last
words
as
he
silently
pressed
our
hands
and
with
a
tear
in
his
blue
eye
and
a
low
sweet
voice
that
thrilled
through
my
inmost
being
said
boys
if
i
never
see
you
here
again
try
to
meet
me
on
the
other
side
of
jordan
it
our
last
earthly
meeting
colonel
claiborne
accompanied
us
to
the
cars
where
we
found
we
were
to
be
escorted
by
a
detachment
of
morgan
celebrated
guerillas
claiborne
gave
orders
for
our
humane
treatment
saying
they
are
men
like
other
men
and
gentlemen
too
and
i
want
them
treated
as
such
when
he
left
i
felt
we
had
parted
from
a
friend
rebel
as
he
was
claiborne
parting
charge
procured
us
courtesy
from
our
guard
indeed
they
were
a
much
better
class
of
men
than
the
great
mass
of
the
southern
army
several
of
them
told
us
that
they
had
enlisted
with
morgan
only
to
make
money
and
were
getting
it
fast
all
were
well
dressed
in
citizens
clothes
and
had
the
language
and
manners
of
gentlemen
they
had
another
motive
in
treating
us
kindly
a
large
number
of
their
own
band
were
now
in
the
hands
of
the
government
and
were
equally
liable
with
ourselves
under
every
rule
of
right
to
be
treated
as
criminals
for
they
had
not
only
dressed
in
clothes
but
had
even
assumed
our
uniform
wherever
it
was
their
interest
to
do
so
they
were
indignant
to
see
us
in
irons
and
said
they
would
not
be
afraid
to
guard
us
with
our
limbs
free
but
did
not
of
course
dare
to
remove
our
fastenings
we
had
been
started
as
usual
without
any
rations
on
the
calculation
that
we
should
fast
till
we
reached
our
destination
which
would
be
in
about
hours
but
our
guerilla
friends
would
not
permit
this
they
bought
pies
and
literally
feasted
us
saying
that
their
money
was
plenty
and
when
it
was
gone
they
could
easily
get
more
from
our
men
we
hoped
that
we
might
have
morgan
men
for
our
escort
in
all
future
migrations
we
arrived
in
knoxville
shortly
after
noon
and
marched
through
the
hot
dusty
streets
directly
to
the
old
jail
this
is
now
a
historical
edifice
it
will
forever
remain
associated
with
the
extreme
sufferings
of
the
loyal
east
tennesseeans
during
the
progress
of
the
great
rebellion
the
building
itself
is
a
noble
one
and
resembles
some
old
baronial
hall
it
is
of
a
peculiar
style
of
architecture
solid
square
and
massive
with
lofty
projecting
towers
and
sharp
angles
altogether
presenting
an
imposing
appearance
it
was
used
as
a
military
prison
and
was
filled
from
top
to
bottom
with
ragged
prisoners
some
were
union
men
and
others
were
deserters
from
their
own
rebel
ranks
these
constituted
the
class
of
prisoners
and
were
permitted
to
range
over
most
of
the
building
which
was
completely
encircled
outside
by
a
strong
guard
the
higher
class
or
those
who
were
charged
with
more
desperate
offences
were
shut
up
in
cages
there
were
five
of
these
two
of
them
were
at
once
cleared
for
our
reception
the
smaller
one
was
about
seven
feet
by
nine
and
four
of
us
were
put
into
it
the
larger
in
which
the
remainder
of
the
party
were
placed
was
perhaps
ten
by
twelve
the
latter
was
the
cage
in
which
parson
brownlow
had
been
confined
and
we
felt
honored
by
being
in
the
same
cell
that
this
noble
champion
of
the
union
had
once
occupied
while
in
this
cage
we
read
an
article
in
a
copy
of
the
stating
that
brownlow
was
in
the
north
humbugging
the
yankees
by
telling
them
that
he
had
been
kept
in
an
iron
cage
and
fired
at
by
his
guards
when
everybody
in
that
vicinity
knew
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
falsity
even
while
we
read
this
we
looked
at
the
which
were
still
visible
on
the
cage
and
which
the
guards
and
prisoners
assured
us
had
been
made
in
the
way
brownlow
stated
this
may
serve
as
a
specimen
of
the
manner
in
which
southern
papers
are
accustomed
to
deal
with
facts
it
was
in
the
latter
part
of
may
when
we
arrived
in
knoxville
and
the
weather
was
intensely
warm
but
from
the
enormous
masses
of
stone
and
iron
around
it
was
quite
cool
indeed
the
nights
which
are
always
cool
even
in
midsummer
in
the
warmest
parts
of
the
south
were
here
very
cold
and
as
we
had
no
beds
or
blankets
but
had
to
lie
on
the
partly
iron
floor
we
suffered
greatly
here
we
formed
the
acquaintance
of
a
few
tennesseeans
who
continued
with
us
during
the
remainder
of
our
sojourn
in
dixie
one
of
the
most
remarkable
of
their
number
was
named
pierce
he
was
some
sixty
years
old
and
had
received
a
stroke
with
a
right
down
his
forehead
which
even
after
healing
had
left
a
gash
more
than
an
inch
deep
from
this
he
was
denominated
forked
head
he
was
at
the
same
time
very
religious
and
very
profane
his
voice
would
first
be
heard
singing
hymns
and
next
cursing
the
confederacy
in
no
measured
terms
he
was
however
a
very
clever
man
and
almost
adored
the
name
of
a
union
soldier
here
it
was
that
we
first
became
acquainted
with
captain
fry
he
was
confined
in
a
cage
in
another
room
we
could
not
get
to
see
him
but
could
entrust
little
notes
written
on
the
margin
of
newspapers
to
the
more
faithful
of
the
outside
prisoners
and
were
always
sure
of
a
reply
there
was
one
man
in
the
same
room
with
me
but
in
another
cage
in
whom
i
became
especially
interested
he
was
between
seventy
and
eighty
years
old
and
was
awaiting
sentence
of
death
before
his
arrest
he
had
been
a
union
man
and
of
course
a
marked
object
of
suspicion
to
his
secession
neighbors
a
band
of
these
came
one
night
for
the
purpose
of
robbing
him
he
endeavored
to
prevent
them
when
they
attacked
him
drawing
revolvers
and
they
fired
several
shots
and
pursued
him
he
dodged
around
old
barrels
and
other
pieces
of
furniture
in
the
outhouse
where
the
assault
was
made
for
some
time
until
finally
he
managed
to
seize
a
and
plunge
it
into
the
foremost
of
his
foes
then
breaking
away
he
escaped
for
the
time
the
robber
whom
he
wounded
afterwards
died
and
the
confederate
government
arrested
the
old
man
and
confined
him
in
the
cage
on
a
charge
of
murder
i
never
heard
the
result
of
it
but
have
no
doubt
that
he
has
long
since
been
hung
we
obtained
quite
a
number
of
papers
while
here
and
were
much
pleased
to
learn
of
the
continued
progress
of
our
arms
particularly
in
the
west
the
taking
of
fort
pillow
the
evacuation
of
memphis
and
corinth
with
the
destruction
of
the
rebel
flotilla
on
the
mississippi
all
came
out
in
one
paper
and
the
editor
complained
that
he
had
been
restrained
from
publishing
this
by
the
government
for
more
than
two
weeks
after
the
intelligence
arrived
one
day
we
received
news
that
sent
the
blood
coursing
through
our
veins
in
swifter
flow
it
was
that
andrews
and
one
other
of
our
party
escaped
from
here
to
preserve
the
unity
of
the
story
i
will
give
a
history
of
the
events
that
took
place
at
chattanooga
subsequent
to
our
departure
no
unusual
event
occurred
until
a
week
after
we
had
left
then
one
day
an
officer
entered
the
yard
where
our
boys
were
enjoying
the
shade
of
the
prison
in
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
and
carelessly
handed
to
andrews
his
it
was
a
terrible
shock
but
was
borne
bravely
he
communicated
the
startling
intelligence
to
our
comrades
as
soon
as
they
again
assembled
in
their
room
at
once
they
resolved
to
carry
into
immediate
execution
the
plan
of
escape
on
which
now
depended
their
leader
only
chance
of
life
he
was
separated
from
them
and
put
down
into
the
dungeon
but
this
did
not
interfere
with
their
plans
for
with
the
same
knife
which
was
so
serviceable
in
making
keys
a
hole
was
cut
above
the
bolts
of
the
allowing
it
to
be
raised
this
done
which
was
late
at
night
they
drew
andrews
up
by
blankets
and
then
went
to
work
cutting
another
hole
through
the
ceiling
while
they
were
performing
the
most
noisy
part
of
this
operation
they
deadened
the
sound
by
singing
the
jailor
afterward
remarked
that
he
might
have
known
there
was
something
the
matter
by
their
singing
so
mournfully
when
all
their
preparations
were
completed
the
gray
tint
of
dawn
was
just
beginning
to
rise
in
the
east
there
was
no
time
to
lose
andrews
quickly
mounted
aloft
a
rope
was
formed
of
some
twisted
blankets
and
the
next
moment
he
was
swinging
outside
of
the
wall
but
in
passing
through
the
hole
he
loosened
some
bricks
which
fell
to
the
ground
and
thus
gave
the
alarm
the
accident
caused
him
to
drop
his
boots
which
he
afterward
sorely
needed
the
guard
was
instantly
aroused
but
andrews
dropped
to
the
ground
darted
to
the
fence
and
was
over
before
he
could
be
prevented
john
wollam
followed
and
even
while
suspended
in
the
air
by
the
blankets
was
fired
upon
fortunately
the
hands
of
the
guards
were
too
unsteady
to
inflict
any
injury
and
he
too
succeeded
in
getting
out
of
the
yard
in
safety
now
the
excitement
became
intense
all
chattanooga
was
roused
and
the
whole
force
started
in
pursuit
of
the
flying
fugitives
the
officers
hurried
to
the
prison
and
roundly
berated
our
boys
because
they
did
not
give
the
alarm
when
their
comrades
were
escaping
colonel
claiborne
the
marshal
who
had
shown
us
some
humanity
was
summarily
dismissed
from
his
office
for
that
cause
alone
and
the
press
came
out
in
the
most
violent
language
denouncing
the
officers
in
charge
and
particularly
general
leadbetter
for
their
false
philanthropy
in
not
having
us
chained
to
the
floor
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
escape
impossible
our
flying
comrades
had
separated
as
soon
as
they
left
the
prison
it
was
now
daylight
and
they
could
not
continue
their
flight
without
the
most
imminent
danger
of
discovery
andrews
went
only
a
few
hundred
yards
from
town
and
there
secreted
himself
in
a
tree
in
plain
view
of
the
railroad
he
remained
all
day
in
this
uncomfortable
position
and
saw
the
trains
running
under
his
feet
and
heard
his
pursuers
speculating
as
to
what
course
he
could
have
taken
the
search
was
most
thorough
but
fortunately
his
umbrageous
shelter
was
secure
at
night
he
came
down
and
swam
the
river
but
lost
most
of
his
clothing
in
the
passage
he
then
journeyed
on
nearly
naked
in
the
morning
just
at
the
break
of
day
he
crossed
a
small
open
field
on
his
way
to
a
tree
in
which
he
intended
to
take
shelter
as
he
had
done
the
day
before
but
unfortunately
he
was
observed
immediately
pursuit
was
made
but
he
dashed
through
the
woods
and
regained
the
river
much
lower
down
than
he
had
crossed
the
evening
before
here
he
swam
a
narrow
channel
and
reached
a
small
island
where
for
a
time
he
secreted
himself
among
some
driftwood
at
the
upper
end
of
the
island
a
party
with
bloodhounds
now
came
over
from
the
mainland
in
search
of
him
he
was
soon
observed
but
broke
away
from
them
and
ran
around
the
lower
end
of
the
island
wading
in
the
shallow
water
and
in
this
way
threw
the
hounds
off
his
track
then
he
plunged
into
a
dense
thicket
with
which
the
island
was
covered
and
again
ascended
a
tree
there
for
a
long
time
he
remained
securely
concealed
while
his
pursuers
searched
the
whole
island
being
frequently
under
the
very
tree
whose
high
foliage
effectually
screened
him
from
the
sight
of
dogs
and
men
at
last
they
abandoned
the
search
in
despair
concluding
that
he
had
by
some
means
left
the
island
and
slowly
took
their
departure
to
the
shore
to
concert
new
plans
of
search
two
little
boys
who
came
along
merely
for
curiosity
were
all
that
still
lingered
behind
at
length
in
their
childish
prattle
one
of
them
said
he
saw
a
great
bunch
on
a
tree
the
other
looked
shifted
his
position
looked
again
and
exclaimed
that
it
was
this
alarmed
them
both
and
they
called
aloud
announcing
the
discovery
to
their
friends
on
shore
the
latter
instantly
returned
and
andrews
seeing
himself
observed
dropped
from
the
tree
ran
to
the
lower
end
of
the
island
took
a
small
log
with
a
limb
for
a
paddle
and
shoved
into
the
stream
hoping
to
reach
the
opposite
shore
before
he
could
be
overtaken
but
there
was
another
party
with
a
skiff
lower
down
the
river
who
saw
him
and
rowed
out
to
meet
him
thus
enclosed
there
was
no
hope
and
he
surrendered
he
was
in
a
most
wretched
condition
having
eaten
nothing
since
he
left
the
jail
his
feet
were
all
cut
and
bleeding
from
running
over
the
sharp
stones
and
his
back
and
shoulders
were
parched
and
blistered
from
exposure
unprotected
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
he
said
he
felt
so
miserable
that
the
thought
of
the
certain
death
to
which
he
then
resigned
himself
had
no
further
terror
for
him
he
was
brought
back
to
chattanooga
where
a
blacksmith
welded
a
pair
of
heavy
clevises
on
his
ankles
and
connected
them
with
a
chain
only
about
eighteen
inches
in
length
he
had
then
but
few
more
days
to
live
and
his
confinement
was
most
rigid
they
prepared
a
scaffold
for
him
at
chattanooga
but
the
indications
of
an
advance
by
mitchel
induced
them
to
change
the
death
scene
to
atlanta
all
the
way
down
to
that
place
he
was
taunted
with
his
approaching
doom
by
the
mobs
who
surrounded
every
station
our
eight
comrades
accompanied
him
to
atlanta
but
parted
as
soon
as
they
arrived
they
going
to
prison
and
he
to
the
place
of
execution
he
was
compelled
to
walk
all
ironed
as
he
was
and
the
clanking
of
his
chains
no
doubt
made
sweet
music
in
the
ears
of
these
human
bloodhounds
he
displayed
great
firmness
when
led
to
the
place
of
execution
and
mounted
the
scaffold
without
a
tremor
when
swung
off
the
rope
by
which
he
was
suspended
stretched
so
that
his
feet
came
to
the
ground
but
nothing
disconcerted
these
wretches
dug
the
earth
away
from
under
him
and
completed
the
murder
thus
died
a
good
and
brave
man
at
the
early
age
of
by
the
hands
of
rebels
for
the
crime
of
loving
and
trying
to
serve
his
country
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
young
lady
of
his
own
adopted
state
the
same
month
in
which
he
suffered
death
on
the
scaffold
it
is
now
time
to
return
to
wollam
whom
we
left
outside
of
the
trying
to
get
away
from
chattanooga
he
ran
down
to
the
river
side
and
seeing
no
way
of
crossing
himself
hit
on
the
brilliant
ruse
of
making
them
believe
that
he
was
across
to
this
end
he
threw
off
his
coat
and
vest
dropping
them
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
then
after
walking
a
few
rods
in
the
water
to
elude
the
hounds
quietly
slipped
back
and
hid
in
a
dense
thicket
of
canes
and
rushes
he
heard
his
pursuers
on
the
bank
above
him
and
all
around
talking
of
their
various
plans
at
last
they
found
the
clothes
and
at
once
concluded
that
he
had
taken
to
the
river
then
they
took
the
bloodhounds
over
to
the
other
side
and
searched
for
the
place
of
his
exit
from
the
water
the
dogs
could
not
find
that
as
might
be
expected
and
then
after
a
due
time
spent
in
consultation
they
concluded
that
he
was
drowned
and
departing
much
comforted
searched
no
more
for
him
after
spending
a
day
of
most
anxious
suspense
the
approach
of
night
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
leaving
his
he
now
cautiously
made
his
way
down
the
river
on
the
chattanooga
side
at
length
he
found
a
canoe
in
which
he
rowed
at
night
and
when
morning
came
he
would
sink
it
and
hide
in
the
bushes
then
in
the
evening
raise
it
and
again
pursue
his
way
twice
he
passed
the
extempore
mitchel
had
made
but
feared
it
was
some
secession
craft
and
therefore
crept
cautiously
by
in
the
shadow
of
the
shore
without
being
discovered
at
last
he
thought
he
was
beyond
the
danger
of
probable
capture
and
went
boldly
forward
in
the
day
time
this
was
a
fatal
mistake
a
band
of
cavalry
who
were
camped
almost
within
our
lines
saw
him
and
procuring
a
boat
came
out
to
meet
him
he
was
unable
to
escape
and
thus
the
poor
fellow
was
captured
on
the
very
brink
of
safety
he
at
first
tried
to
persuade
them
that
he
was
a
confederate
but
unfortunately
a
lieutenant
edwards
who
had
assisted
in
capturing
him
the
first
time
happened
to
be
present
and
at
once
recognized
him
he
was
soon
after
taken

atlanta

we

read
of
the
recapture
of
andrews
with
the
most
poignant
regret
though
we
knew
not
yet
that
he
had
received
the
sentence
of
death
of
wollam
we
heard
nothing
we
were
well
supplied
with
papers
here
as
there
were
plenty
of
union
people
who
ministered
to
our
wants
one
day
we
received
a
paper
containing
an
account
of
the
of
it
was
awful
news
to
us
we
had
been
engaged
just
before
in
all
kinds
of
games
and
for
we
were
always
merry
and
never
suffered
ourselves
to
indulge
in
gloomy
forebodings
but
when
this
news
came
all
noise
and
merriment
were
hushed
and
we
passed
a
whole
day
in
the
most
heartfelt
mourning
we
all
loved
our
leader
and
would
willingly
have
engaged
in
the
most
desperate
enterprise
to
save
his
life
but
alas
he
was
gone
and
there
was
no
chance
even
for
that
vengeance
for
which
our
souls
thirsted
before
we
had
been
long
at
knoxville
we
were
notified
to
prepare
for
trial
we
requested
that
we
should
all
be
tried
at
once
as
our
cases
were
precisely
alike
when
this
was
not
granted
we
next
asked
that
one
might
be
tried
and
his
sentence
be
the
sentence
of
the
whole
party
but
this
too
was
refused
with
the
reply
that
they
knew
their
own
business
best
we
were
forced
to
accept
this
decision
though
we
could
not
imagine
why
it
was
that
they
should
thus
insist
on
trying
but
one
at
a
time
the
only
reason
that
i
can
yet
conjecture
for
this
proceeding
is
that
it
would
have
looked
too
absurd
to
arraign
or
even
twelve
men
all
in
a
body
and
from
one
brigade
as
spies
they
allowed
us
the
privilege
of
counsel
and
we
employed
two
good
union
men
colonels
baxter
and
temple
who
volunteered
their
services
we
were
each
to
pay
them
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
and
as
fast
as
we
were
tried
to
give
our
notes
for
that
amount
the
charges
and
specifications
of
william
campbell
were
first
handed
in
he
was
a
citizen
but
claimed
to
be
a
soldier
and
we
endorsed
his
position
the
charge
against
all
who
were
brought
to
trial
was
for
lurking
in
and
around
confederate
camps
as
spies
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
information
not
a
word
was
said
of
taking
the
cars
or
of
anything
we
really
did
do
our
plan
of
defence
has
been
partly
indicated
before
it
was
to
tell
just
who
we
were
and
what
we
had
done
with
the
exceptions
of
the
pranks
we
had
played
on
the
rebel
citizens
coming
down
and
to
claim
that
we
were
united
states
soldiers
detailed
on
a
military
expedition
without
our
consent
and
therefore
entitled
to
the
protection
accorded
to
regular
prisoners
of
war
this
was
put
into
words
and
read
on
the
trial
as
the
acknowledgement
of
the
party
while
pleading
not
guilty
to
the
charge
the
only
evidence
they
had
was
of
the
men
who
pursued
us
on
the
train
and
also
of
those
who
afterward
arrested
us
but
of
course
none
of
these
knew
anything
of
our
lurking
around
the
camps
george
wilson
related
a
ludicrous
incident
that
occurred
when
he
was
on
trial
and
which
fitly
illustrates
the
desire
they
had
to
convict
us
it
was
of
a
young
lieutenant
belonging
to
the
who
requested
to
be
sworn
saying
that
he
could
tell
of
at
least
one
place
we
had
passed
the
confederate
guards
on
his
request
being
complied
with
he
testified
that
we
crossed
their
at
the
ferry
on
the
evening
of
our
first
arrival
at
chattanooga
immediately
the
president
of
the
court
arose
and
said
that
he
commanded
the
guard
that
day
and
guard
was
placed
at
the
the
whole
court
was
instantly
in
a
roar
of
laughter
and
the
confusion
of
our
convictor
may
be
better
imagined
than
described
our
lawyers
were
delighted
with
the
course
we
took
and
said
that
it
had
deranged
all
the
plans
of
the
prosecution
and
that
they
had
not
a
particle
of
evidence
against
us
that
if
we
were
convicted
now
it
would
be
through
mere
prejudice
and
perjury
on
the
part
of
the
court
as
the
trial
of
different
ones
proceeded
we
had
still
greater
encouragement
from
the
court
itself
members
called
on
us
and
told
us
to
keep
in
good
heart
as
there
was
no
evidence
before
them
to
convict
any
one
this
cheered
us
somewhat
but
there
was
still
one
thing
which
i
did
not
like
and
which
looked
as
if
something
was
wrong
the
court
would
not
let
our
boys
be
present
to
hear
the
pleading
of
counsel
on
either
side
though
they
urgently
requested
it
they
could
neither
hear
what
our
lawyers
had
to
say
for
them
nor
what
the
judge
advocate
urged
against
them
this
seemed
still
stranger
because
andrews
had
not
been
debarred
this
privilege
but
they
used
our
soldiers
with
even
less
show
of
justice
than
had
been
accorded
to
him
after
three
or
four
had
been
tried
one
of
our
lawyers
visited
the
prison
and
read
to
us
the
plea
which
he
said
he
had
read
to
the
court
it
was
an
able
paper
i
still
remember
its
principal
features
he
contended
that
our
being
dressed
in
citizens
clothes
was
nothing
more
than
what
the
confederate
government
had
expressly
authorized
and
that
it
was
done
by
all
the
guerillas
in
the
service
of
the
confederacy
whenever
it
was
for
their
interest
and
he
cited
the
instance
of
general
morgan
having
dressed
his
men
in
federal
uniform
and
passed
them
off
as
belonging
to
the
eighth
pennsylvania
cavalry
by
which
means
he
succeeded
in
reaching
a
railroad
and
damaging
it
also
that
our
government
had
captured
some
of
these
very
men
and
treated
them
as
prisoners
of
war
this
instance
was
mentioned
to
show
that
our
being
dressed
in
citizens
clothes
did
not
take
from
us
the
right
to
be
treated
as
united
states
soldiers
the
plea
went
on
further
to
state
that
we
had
told
the
object
of
our
expedition
that
it
was
a
purely
military
one
for
the
destruction
of
communications
and
as
such
entirely
lawful
according
to
the
rules
of
war
what
reply
the
judge
advocate
made
to
this
we
never
had
the
means
of
ascertaining
the
trials
proceeded
rapidly
one
man
was
taken
out
each
day
and
in
about
an
hour
returned
the
table
in
the
court
room
was
covered
with
bottles
newspapers
and
novels
and
the
court
passed
its
time
during
trial
in
discussing
these
this
was
very
well
if
the
trial
was
as
they
said
a
mere
matter
of
formality
but
if
it
was
a
trial
in
earnest
on
which
depended
issues
of
life
or
death
it
was
most
heartless
conduct
at
last
the
number
of
seven
was
reached
and
they
would
probably
have
proceeded
in
trying
others
had
not
general
mitchel
who
was
continually
troubling
them
now
advanced
and
shelled
chattanooga
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
tennessee
river
this
at
once
broke
up
the
and
sent
the
officers
in
hot
haste
to
their
regiments
to
resist
his
progress
soon
after
general
morgan
advanced
through
cumberland
gap
and
threatened
knoxville
which
also
rendered
it
necessary
to
remove
us
they
came
in
with
ropes
and
began
to
tie
us
we
did
not
at
first
understand
this
and
some
supposed
we
were
to
be
taken
out
for
execution
but
we
soon
became
convinced
that
it
was
only
a
change
of
place
they
arranged
us
for
transportation
by
first
binding
our
hands
together
then
fixing
our
arms
securely
in
the
loops
of
long
ropes
tied
them
firmly
to
our
sides
after
which
we
were
coupled
two
and
two
ropes
were
used
in
fastening
us
instead
of
irons
as
before
because
they
had
borrowed
the
latter
for
some
union
prisoners
who
had
just
been
sent
to
richmond
therefore
we
had
to
be
content
with
a
most
liberal
allowance
of
cotton
rope
while
they
were
thus
arranging
our
manacles
i
had
a
most
amusing
with
the
adjutant
who
was
superintending
the
operation
i
said
to
him
as
politely
as
i
could
i
suppose
sir
our
destination
is
not
known
it
is
not
known
to
you
at
any
rate
sir
was
the
gruff
rejoinder
this
was
noticed
by
the
whole
party
and
i
felt
rather
beaten
but
a
moment
later
came
my
chance
for
revenge
he
turned
again
to
me
and
said
in
a
dictatorial
manner
who
was
it
that
run
your
engine
through
i
bowed
and
returned
in
the
blandest
tone
is
not
known
to
you
at
any
rate
all
around
roared
with
laughter
and
the
adjutant
reddening
to
the
eyes
turned
away
muttering
that
he
believed
i
was
the
engineer
myself
when
everything
was
in
readiness
we
bade
an
adieu
to
the
capital
of
east
tennessee
oh
what
bitter
memories
cluster
around
that
old
gloomy
building
it
has
been
one
of
the
principal
instruments
in
crushing
the
life
and
loyalty
out
of
the
hearts
of
a
brave
but
unfortunate
people
may
the
day
soon
come
when
the
suffering
of
east
tennessee
will
be
richly
repaid
on
the
heads
of
its
guilty
authors
while
we
remained
here
our
fare
was
of
the
most
scanty
character
we
received
it
only
twice
a
day
and
then
in
homeopathic
doses
we
continually
suffered
with
hunger
while
we
were
well
i
myself
became
quite
sick
during
our
imprisonment
here
and
continued
so
for
most
of
the
summer
several
others
were
in
the
same
condition
this
was
rather
an
advantage
for
when
sick
we
did
not
so
much
mind
the
scantiness
of
our
diet
a
number
of
tennesseeans
were
removed
with
us
among
them
was
captain
fry
and
pierce
in
conversation
with
the
former
i
learned
the
full
particulars
of
his
history
some
incidents
of
which
i
had
heard
before
leaving
our
camp
he
had
raised
a
company
of
his
neighbors
and
running
the
gauntlet
of
guarded
roads
succeeded
in
reaching
our
army
in
kentucky
here
he
was
elected
captain
and
remained
for
some
time
after
a
while
the
general
in
command
wished
him
to
go
into
tennessee
and
there
destroy
the
bridges
on
the
virginia
and
tennessee
railroad
then
to
raise
the
loyal
citizens
of
that
vicinity
and
hold
the
country
till
our
forces
could
arrive
he
refused
to
go
until
assured
of
support
from
mcclellan
himself
who
was
at
that
time
the
fall
of
in
command
of
the
whole
united
states
army
and
who
promised
that
a
column
should
advance
as
soon
as
fry
succeeded
with
this
assurance
he
departed
on
his
perilous
mission
he
aroused
the
union
men
in
both
virginia
and
tennessee
burned
the
bridges
and
thus
for
a
time
destroyed
the
most
important
rebel
line
of
communication
and
with
a
force
of
fifteen
hundred
men
held
the
entire
country
embraced
in
his
operations
and
even
seriously
threatened
knoxville
itself
now
was
the
time
for
our
forces
to
have
struck
the
decisive
blow
and
not
only
have
redeemed
east
tennessee
from
its
chains
but
also
severed
the
rebellion
in
halves
it
was
perfectly
practicable
a
large
body
lay
near
camp
dick
robinson
with
only
a
trifling
force
in
front
to
impede
its
progress
but
in
the
meantime
mcclellan
changed
his
and
without
warning
fry
left
him
and
his
brave
companions
to
their
fate
the
struggle
was
a
brief
one
the
secessionists
thus
left
to
themselves
concentrated
an
overwhelming
force
against
him
several
skirmishes
were
fought
and
finally
the
union
force
was
compelled
to
disperse
some
of
them
succeeded
in
reaching
our
lines
in
kentucky
others
were
caught
and
several
of
these
were
hung
without
a
trial
such
were
some
of
the
murders
that
first
rendered
general
leadbetter
notorious
one
of
these
cases
is
almost
too
horrible
for
belief
i
would
hesitate
to
record
it
were
i
not
assured
of
its
truth
by
the
testimony
of
eyewitnesses
separated
by
hundreds
of
miles
it
was
of
a
man
named
named
whan
who
on
being
arrested
acknowledged
that
he
helped
to
burn
the
bridges
but
refused
to
describe
his
companions
for
this
he
was
put
into
a
barrel
driven
full
of
small
nails
and
rolled
down
a
steep
hill
then
taken
out
all
bleeding
and
hung
this
was
on
saturday
and
he
with
his
companions
was
allowed
to
hang
till
monday
night
when
some
of
his
friends
at
the
risk
of
their
own
lives
came
and
took
them
down
should
we
compromise
with
such
fiends
in
human
shape
and
purchase
their
fellowship
again
or
give
them
the
puishment
that
injured
humanity
demands
fry
passed
the
whole
winter
in
the
wild
mountains
with
which
tennessee
abounds
and
in
the
spring
he
again
gathered
his
neighbors
together
a
regiment
strong
and
tried
to
reach
the
union
lines
near
the
border
he
was
attacked
by
a
superior
rebel
force
and
after
a
severe
contest
his
band
was
dispersed
himself
wounded
and
taken
prisoner
this
was
on
the
of
march
and
he
remained
in
solitary
confinement
until
he
joined
us
on
the
of
june
he
was
an
uneducated
man
but
possessed
of
great
natural
ability
and
the
most
undaunted
courage
with
a
heart
as
tender
and
sympathetic
as
a
child
we
took
no
rations
along
and
were
obliged
to
as
we
now
had
no
guerillas
along
to
buy
us
pies
on
the
way
the
populace
taunted
us
with
andrews
death
and
charitably
hoped
that
we
might
soon
meet
the
same
fate
but
some
of
the
officers
talked
with
us
in
a
friendly
spirit
assuring
us
that
we
would
not
be
hurt
this
produced
some
impression
and
taken
in
connection
with
what
had
been
told
us
by
members
of
the
and
others
at
knoxville
made
us
quite
hopeful
when
we
neared
the
atlanta
city
jail
which
was
to
be
our
abode
for
many
weary
months
a
crowd
gathered
as
usual
and
a
man
who
called
himself
mayor
of
the
city
began
to
insult
captain
fry
telling
him
that
he
knew
him
to
be
a
rascal
in
his
own
country
and
that
he
hoped
soon
to
have
the
pleasure
of
hanging
him
then
turning
to
us
he
boasted
that
he
had
put
the
rope
around
andrews
neck
and
was
waiting
and
anxious
to
do
the
same
for
us
this
prison
was
smaller
than
that
at
knoxville
but
was
still
a
large
edifice
the
lower
story
was
occupied
by
the
jailor
and
his
family
the
upper
contained
four
rooms
of
which
we
with
captain
fry
occupied
one
the
tennesseeans
were
put
into
another
just
across
the
entry
from
us
our
comrades
who
had
been
left
at
chattanooga
were
in
another
and
the
last
one
which
was
on
the
same
side
as
ours
was
frequently
occupied
by
negroes
who
had
been
in
search
of
the
north
star
for
some
time
here
our
rations
were
comparatively
good
and
abundant
but
after
awhile
the
task
of
feeding
us
was
taken
from
the
jailor
who
had
at
first
assumed
it
and
then
our
fare
became
worse
than
it
ever
had
been
before
the
jailor
himself
was
a
kind
man
and
rather
of
union
sentiments
he
showed
us
all
the
favor
in
his
power
and
indeed
became
so
much
suspected
that
an
odious
old
man
named
thoer
was
hired
to
watch
him
the
constant
vigilance
of
this
antiquated
scoundrel
with
the
superintendence
of
the
officers
of
the
guard
who
were
always
at
hand
prevented
the
jailor
from
befriending
us
as
much
as
his
heart
dictated
here
we
remained
for
a
week
in
quietness
and
hope
thinking
the
worst
of
our
trials
were
past
little
did
we
foresee
how
fearful
a
storm
was
soon
to
burst
over
us

prayer
one
day
while
we
were
very
merry
amusing
ourselves
with
games
and
stories
we
saw
a
squadron
of
cavalry
approaching
this
did
not
at
first
excite
any
attention
for
it
was
a
common
thing
to
see
bodies
of
horsemen
in
the
streets
but
soon
we
observed
them
halt
at
our
gate
and
surround
the
prison
what
could
this
mean
a
moment
after
the
clink
of
the
officers
swords
was
heard
as
they
ascended
the
stairway
and
we
knew
that
something
unusual
was
about
to
take
place
they
paused
at
our
door
threw
it
open
called
the
names
of
our
seven
companions
and
took
them
out
to
the
room
opposite
putting
the
tennesseeans
in
with
us
one
of
our
boys
named
robinson
was
sick
of
a
fever
and
had
to
be
raised
to
his
feet
and
supported
out
of
the
room
with
throbbing
hearts
we
asked
one
another
the
meaning
of
these
strange
proceedings
some
supposed
they
were
to
receive
their
acquittal
others
still
more
sanguine
believed
they
were
taken
out
of
the
room
to
be
paroled
preparatory
to
an
exchange
i
was
sick
too
but
rose
to
my
feet
oppressed
with
a
nameless
fear
a
half
crazy
kentuckian
who
was
with
the
tennesseeans
came
to
me
and
wanted
to
play
a
game
of
cards
i
struck
the
greasy
pack
out
of
his
hands
and
bade
him
leave
me
a
moment
after
the
door
opened
and
george
wilson
entered
his
step
firm
and
his
form
erect
but
his
countenance
pale
as
death
some
one
asked
a
solution
of
the
dreadful
mystery
in
a
whisper
for
his
face
silenced
every
one
are
to
be
executed
was
the
awful
reply
whispered
with
thrilling
distinctness
the
others
came
in
all
tied
ready
for
the
scaffold
then
came
the
farewells
farewells
with
no
hope
of
meeting
again
in
this
world
it
was
a
moment
that
seemed
an
age
of
measureless
sorrow
our
comrades
were
brave
they
were
soldiers
and
had
often
looked
death
in
the
face
on
the
they
were
ready
if
need
be
to
die
for
their
country
but
to
die
on
the
to
die
as
murderers
die
seemed
almost
too
hard
for
human
nature
to
bear
then
too
the
prospect
of
a
future
world
into
which
they
were
thus
to
be
hurled
without
a
moment
preparation
was
black
and
appalling
most
of
them
had
been
careless
and
had
no
hope
beyond
the
grave
wilson
was
a
professed
infidel
and
many
a
time
had
argued
the
truth
of
the
christian
religion
with
me
for
a
half
day
at
a
time
but
in
this
awful
hour
he
said
to
me
pittenger
i
believe
you
are
right
now
oh
try
to
be
better
prepared
when
you
come
to
die
than
i
am
then
laying
his
hand
on
my
head
with
a
muttered
god
bless
you
we
parted
shadrack
was
profane
and
reckless
but
and
merry
now
turning
to
us
with
a
voice
the
forced
calmness
of
which
was
more
affecting
than
a
wail
of
agony
he
said
boys
i
am
not
prepared
to
meet
jesus
when
asked
by
some
of
us
in
tears
to
think
of
heaven
he
answered
still
in
tones
of
thrilling
calmness
i
try
i
try
but
i
i
am
prepared

was
a
man
of
immense
strength
and
iron
resolution
turned
to
his
friend
buffum
and
could
only
articulate
wife
children
tell
when
utterance
failed
scott
was
married
only
three
days
before
he
came
to
the
army
and
the
thought
of
his
young
and
sorrowing
wife
nearly
drove
him
to
despair
he
could
only
clasp
his
hands
in
silent
agony
ross
was
the
firmest
of
all
his
eyes
beamed
with
unnatural
light
and
there
was
not
a
tremor
in
his
voice
as
he
said
tell
them
at
home
if
any
of
you
escape
that
i
died
for
my
country
and
did
not
regret
it
all
this
transpired
in
a
moment
and
even
then
the
marshal
and
other
officers
standing
by
him
in
the
door
exclaimed
hurry
up
there
come
on
we
ca
wait
in
this
manner
my
poor
comrades
were
hurried
off
robinson
who
was
too
sick
to
walk
was
dragged
away
with
them
they
asked
leave
to
bid
farewell
to
our
other
boys
who
were
confined
in
the
adjoining
room
but
it
was
sternly
refused
thus
we
parted
we
saw
the
death
cart
containing
our
comrades
drive
off
surrounded
by
cavalry
in
about
an
hour
it
came
back
the
tragedy
was
complete
later
in
the
evening
the
came
to
the
prison
and
in
reply
to
our
questions
informed
us
that
our
friends
had
met
their
fate
as
brave
men
should
die
everywhere
the
next
day
we
obtained
from
the
guards
who
were
always
willing
to
talk
with
us
in
the
absence
of
the
officers
full
particulars
of
the
murder
when
our
companions
were
mounted
on
the
scaffold
wilson
asked
permission
to
say
a
few
words
which
was
granted
probably
in
the
hope
of
hearing
some
confession
which
would
justify
them
in
the
murder
they
were
about
to
commit
but
this
was
not
his
intention
it
was
a
strange
stand
a
dying
speech
to
a
desperate
audience
and
under
the
most
terrible
circumstances
but
he
was
equal
to
the
occasion
unterrified
by
the
near
approach
of
death
he
spoke
his
mind
freely
he
told
them
that
they
were
all
in
the
wrong
that
he
had
no
hard
feelings
toward
the
southern
people
for
what
they
were
about
to
do
because
they
had
been
duped
by
their
leaders
and
induced
by
them
to
engage
in
the
work
of
rebellion
he
also
said
that
though
he
was
condemned
as
a
spy
yet
he
was
none
and
they
well
knew
it
he
was
only
a
soldier
in
the
performance
of
the
duty
he
had
been
detailed
to
do
that
he
did
not
regret
to
die
for
his
country
but
only
regretted
the
manner
of
his
death
he
concluded
by
saying
that
they
would
yet
live
to
regret
the
part
they
had
taken
in
this
rebellion
and
would
see
the
time
when
the
old
union
would
be
restored
and
the
flag
of
our
country
wave
over
the
very
ground
occupied
by
his
scaffold
this
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
minds
of
those
who
listened
and
i
often
afterward
heard
it
spoken
of
in
terms
of
the
highest
admiration
when
he
ceased
the
signal
was
given
and
the
traps
fell
a
refugee
from
the
state
of
georgia
now
in
this
city
who
witnessed
the
execution
but
from
peculiar
circumstances
does
not
make
his
name
public
corroborates
this
statement
and
adds
that
these
brave
men
were
surrounded
by
three
or
four
hundred
guerillas
and
partisan
rangers
as
they
called
themselves
who
disputed
for
the
honor
of
being
the
executioners
the
matter
was
settled
by
the
party
taking
a
vote
when
twelve
were
selected
as
the
favored
ones
the
rebel
soldiers
who
perpetrated
this
outrageous
murder
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
spreeing
and
jollification
many
of
them
writing
to
their
friends
at
home
an
account
of
the
pleasure
they
felt
in
assisting
in
the
hanging
of
seven
as
they
termed
the
union
from
a
pamphlet
entitled
ohio
boys
in
dixie
published
in
new
york
in
april
five
only
remained
dangling
in
the
air
for
two
of
the
seven
campbell
and
slavens
being
very
heavy
men
broke
the
ropes
and
fell
to
the
ground
insensible
in
a
short
time
they
recovered
and
asked
for
a
drink
of
water
which
was
given
them
then
they
requested
an
hour
to
pray
before
entering
the
future
world
which
lay
so
near
and
dark
before
them
this
last
petition
was
indignantly
refused
and
as
soon
as
the
ropes
could
be
adjusted
they
were
compelled
to
the
scaffold
and
were
again
turned
off
the
whole
proceeding
from
beginning
to
end
was
marked
by
the
most
revolting
haste
they
seemed
to
wish
by
thus
affording
no
time
to
prepare
for
death
to
murder
soul
and
body
both
even
the
worst
criminals
in
our
country
are
allowed
some
weeks
to
ask
for
mercy
before
they
are
thrust
into
his
presence
but
our
poor
boys
whose
only
crime
was
loving
and
trying
to
serve
their
country
were
not
allowed
one
moment
could
the
barbarity
of
fiends
go
further
that
afternoon
was
one
of
deepest
gloom
for
those
who
remained
we
knew
not
how
soon
we
might
be
compelled
to
follow
in
the
same
path
and
drink
the
same
bitter
cup
our
comrades
drank
once
during
the
trial
we
had
offered
to
accept
the
award
of
the
court
in
one
of
the
cases
as
the
sentence
of
all
since
we
could
not
see
the
slightest
reason
for
leaving
some
and
taking
others
at
that
time
however
we
believed
that
all
would
be
acquitted
now
every
hope
had
vanished
but
even
without
the
addition
of
fear
for
ourselves
the
parting
from
our
loved
friends
whose
voices
were
still
ringing
in
our
ears
while
they
themselves
had
passed
beyond
the
gates
of
death
into
the
unknown
land
of
shadows
was
enough
to
rend
the
stoutest
heart
there
were
tears
then
from
eyes
that
shrank
before
no
danger
but
i
could
not
shed
a
tear
a
cloud
of
burning
heat
rushed
to
my
head
that
seemed
to
scorch
through
every
vein
for
hours
i
scarcely
knew
where
i
was
or
the
loss
i
had
sustained
every
glance
around
the
room
which
revealed
the
vacant
places
of
our
friends
would
bring
our
sorrow
freshly
on
us
again
thus
the
afternoon
passed
away
in
grief
too
deep
for
words
slowly
and
silently
the
moments
wore
on
and
no
one
ventured
to
whisper
of
hope
at
last
some
voice
suggested
that
we
should
seek
relief
in
prayer
the
very
idea
seemed
to
convey
consolation
and
was
eagerly
accepted
soon
we
knelt
around
the
bare
walls
of
our
strange
sanctuary
and
with
bleeding
hearts
drew
near
the
throne
of
god
captain
fry
first
led
us
and
mingled
sobs
with
strong
supplications
then
each
followed
in
his
turn
with
but
one
or
two
exceptions
and
even
these
were
kneeling
with
the
rest
as
the
twilight
deepened
our
devotional
exercises
grew
more
solemn
in
the
lonely
shadow
of
coming
night
with
eternity
thus
open
tangibly
before
us
and
standing
on
its
very
brink
we
prayed
with
a
fervor
that
those
who
dwell
in
safety
can
scarcely
conceive
we
besought
our
father
only
that
we
might
be
prepared
for
the
fate
that
was
inevitable
and
that
as
he
had
led
us
through
great
trials
he
would
be
our
comforter
and
sustain
us
still
who
will
say
that
such
prayer
was
not
effectual
it
was
heard
in
heaven
even
there
in
that
prison
surrounded
by
an
armed
guard
amid
the
gloom
of
coming
danger
the
peace
of
god
like
a
dove
bearing
the
olive
branch
descended
into
every
broken
and
believing
heart
it
was
a
holy
hour
and
if
the
angels
above
ever
bend
from
their
bright
mansions
to
comfort
human
sorrow
i
do
believe
that
they
were
then
hovering
near
from
that
hour
i
date
the
birth
of
an
immortal
hope
and
i
believe
that
many
of
my
companions
also
on
looking
back
will
realize
that
they
passed
from
death
to
life
in
that
dreary

difficulties
of
precious

from
this
time
forward
we
had
religious
exercises
each
morning
and
evening
and
they
were
a
blessed
consolation
to
us
sustaining
our
hearts
when
every
earthly
avenue
of
hope
had
closed
frequently
we
startled
the
guards
who
were
around
us
by
the
hymns
we
sang
for
now
the
character
of
our
songs
was
changed
and
our
thoughts
and
aspirations
began
to
point
upward
it
is
a
delicate
matter
to
speak
of
one
own
religious
experience
but
in
the
hope
of
doing
good
i
will
venture
at
first
my
hopes
were
not
bright
for
days
and
weeks
an
impenetrable
cloud
seemed
to
rest
over
me
and
to
vail
heaven
from
my
view
sometimes
for
a
moment
it
would
give
way
and
show
light
and
peace
beyond
then
close
up
thick
and
dark
and
lowering
as
ever
but
at
last
the
day
gradually
arose
and
i
was
enabled
to
rejoice
in
hopes
the
world
can
neither
give
nor
take
away
but
these
were
long
and
weary
days
our
room
was
of
greater
size
than
that
in
chattanooga
and
had
larger
windows
yet
the
heat
was
fearfully
oppressive
our
other
boys
were
put
in
the
room
with
us
which
made
fifteen
in
all
one
of
them
named
wood
was
very
sick
he
had
been
prostrated
with
the
fever
for
nearly
a
month
and
at
this
time
his
life
was
despaired
of
this
was
not
thought
to
be
any
great
misfortune
to
him
by
the
others
who
administered
consolation
in
a
style
worthy
of
the
best
of
job
friends
they
reasoned
now
if
you
get
well
you
will
only
be
hung
you
had
better
try
to
die
yourself
and
thus
you
will
outwit
them
wood
however
did
not
relish
the
counsel
and
getting
contrary
he
recovered
just
for
spite
as
he
often
declared
he
yet
lives
to
laugh
over
the
advice
that
his
despairing
associates
gave
him
we
had
friends
in
the
waiters
of
the
prison
though
their
faces
were
black
they
assisted
us
by
every
means
in
their
power
it
was
not
long
till
they
found
that
there
was
nothing
we
desired
so
much
as
to
read
the
news
and
they
taxed
their
ingenuity
to
gratify
us
they
would
wait
till
the
jailor
or
some
of
the
guard
had
finished
reading
a
paper
and
laid
it
down
and
then
slyly
purloin
it
when
meal
time
came
it
would
be
put
into
the
bottom
of
the
pan
in
which
our
food
was
brought
and
thus
handed
in
to
us
the
paper
had
to
be
returned
in
the
same
way
to
avoid
suspicion
the
guards
and
officers
would
talk
with
us
and
always
finding
us
possessed
of
a
knowledge
of
the
events
of
the
war
at
least
as
far
as
the
southern
papers
gave
it
came
at
last
to
think
we
had
an
instinctive
idea
of
news
something
like
what
the
bee
has
of
geometrical
forms
they
never
suspected
the
negroes
though
for
several
months
it
was
only
through
their
instrumentality
that
we
could
obtain
any
definite
information
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
without
in
one
of
these
papers
i
noticed
a
description
of
two
federal
officers
who
had
escaped
from
macon
georgia
it
was
captain
geer
with
whom
i
have
lectured
in
several
places
since
my
return
and
his
comrade
lieutenant
collins
their
adventures
are
recorded
in
a
book
called
the
having
found
the
negroes
thus
intelligent
and
useful
far
beyond
what
i
had
supposed
possible
i
questioned
them
about
other
matters
they
were
better
informed
than
i
had
given
them
credit
for
and
knew
enough
to
disbelieve
all
the
stories
rebels
told
when
the
whites
were
not
present
they
laughed
at
the
grand
victories
the
papers
were
publishing
every
day
but
rather
leaned
to
the
opposite
extreme
and
gave
them
less
credit
than
was
their
due
for
they
would
believe
that
the
federal
troops
were
always
victorious
even
after
repulse
before
richmond
they
continued
for
weeks
to
assure
us
that
he
had
the
town
and
had
beaten
the
rebels
in
every
engagement
they
imagined
that
all
the
northern
troops
were
chivalrous
soldiers
fighting
for
the
universal
rights
of
man
and
of
course
they
esteemed
it
a
high
privilege
to
contribute
to
the
comfort
of
such
noble
men
some
of
them
had
imbibed
the
idea
which
is
common
with
the
poor
whites
of
the
south
that
lincoln
is
a
negro
or
a
mulatto
but
most
of
them
placed
so
little
credit
in
the
assertions
of
their
masters
that
they
disbelieved
this
story
also
but
they
never
wavered
in
their
belief
that
the
union
troops
would
conquer
and
that
the
result
of
the
victory
would
be
their
freedom
i
had
extensive
opportunities
for
observing
them
as
the
room
next
to
us
was
appropriated
to
the
of
negroes
and
i
never
yet
saw
one
who
did
not
cherish
an
ardent
desire
for
freedom
and
wish
and
long
for
the
time
when
the
triumph
of
the
national
forces
would
place
the
coveted
boon
within
his
grasp
one
morning
our
jailor
came
to
our
room
and
asked
us
if
we
knew
john
wollam
we
hesitated
to
answer
as
we
could
not
fathom
the
motives
of
the
inquiry
but
even
while
we
deliberated
among
ourselves
john
came
up
and
ended
our
doubts
by
greeting
us
heartily
he
had
been
parted
from
us
some
three
weeks
and
in
that
time
had
suffered
most
incredible
hardships
in
the
manner
i
have
narrated
before
he
joined
us
in
our
with
much
good
will
now
all
the
survivors
of
our
party
were
together
again
there
is
one
georgia
minister
i
will
always
remember
with
gratitude
not
that
he
was
a
union
man
for
i
have
no
evidence
that
he
was
but
because
of
his
generosity
to
us
he
was
a
methodist
clergyman
in
atlanta
by
the
name
of
mcdonnell
he
came
to
visit
us
at
the
suggestion
of
our
old
jailor
who
seeing
us
engaged
in
religious
exercises
naturally
supposed
we
would
like
to
talk
with
a
preacher
we
received
him
kindly
and
an
interesting
conversation
took
place
some
of
the
boys
were
slightly
offended
by
his
first
prayer
in
which
he
petitioned
that
our
lives
might
be
spared
if
consistent
with
the
of
the
we
did
not
very
well
like
the
condition
but
said
nothing
and
were
afterward
rewarded
for
our
complacency
at
my
request
he
loaned
us
a
few
books
and
when
these
were
read
through
gave
us
still
others
until
we
had
read
nearly
his
entire
library
those
only
who
know
what
a
terrible
weariness
it
is
to
pass
time
without
any
definite
employment
and
with
no
means
of
relieving
the
hours
that
hang
so
heavily
on
their
hands
or
of
diverting
their
thoughts
from
the
one
round
can
form
any
idea
of
the
great
boon
that
a
few
good
books
bestowed
on
us
our
provision
here
became
worse
and
less
until
it
very
nearly
reached
the
starvation
point
for
some
months
the
only
food
we
received
was
a
very
short
allowance
of
baked
with
all
the
bran
in
it
and
without
salt
with
a
little
pork
mostly
spoiled
frequently
the
pork
would
be
completely
covered
with
maggots
and
disgusting
as
it
was
hunger
compelled
us
to
eat
it
even
then
there
was
not
enough
of
this
miserable
fare
to
satisfy
our
appetites
what
would
those
who
spend
their
time
in
denouncing
our
government
as
the
only
enemy
and
sympathize
with
our
mistaken
southern
brethren
who
have
been
alienated
by
the
misconduct
of
the
loyal
states
say
if
these
brethren
had
subjected
them
to
the
same
treatment
their
sympathies
would
hardly
have
survived
the
trial
dreary
as
the
days
were
here
yet
we
did
not
surrender
ourselves
to
gloomy
forebodings
and
vain
lamentings
over
our
misfortunes
although
the
fate
of
our
companions
seemed
suspended
over
our
heads
by
a
single
hair
yet
we
shunned
despondency
and
labored
to
provide
such
amusements
as
would
relieve
us
of
the
heavy
tedium
of
our
on
that
terrible
day
of
execution
we
threw
away
our
cards
which
before
had
been
played
almost
day
and
night
and
resolved
to
engage
no
more
in
that
game
but
the
necessity
of
doing
something
prompted
us
to
search
for
new
pastimes
we
carved
a
on
the
floor
and
it
was
occupied
from
morning
till
evening
by
eager
players
we
all
became
very
expert
in
checkers
to
provide
a
more
intellectual
amusement
we
also
formed
a
debating
society
and
spent
hour
after
hour
in
discussing
quaint
questions
of
every
kind
many
were
the
speeches
that
were
made
for
time
was
no
object
and
if
no
one
was
convinced
of
a
new
position
we
still
had
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
there
was
no
lost
labor
where
the
labor
itself
was
a
pleasure
in
order
to
enjoy
to
the
fullest
extent
the
books
we
had
so
fortunately
procured
we
appointed
regular
reading
hours
two
in
the
forenoon
and
the
same
in
the
afternoon
during
this
time
no
one
was
allowed
even
to
whisper
some
of
our
boys
were
a
little
wild
and
restless
at
times
and
would
break
the
rules
but
generally
our
order
was
excellent
we
gained
much
useful
knowledge
during
these
hours
of
intellectual
employment
in
our
novel
school
but
all
our
efforts
to
pleasantly
while
away
those
terribly
long
summer
days
were
in
vain
the
tediousness
and
oppressiveness
and
vain
longing
for
action
would
press
down
on
us
closer
and
closer
brown
who
was
one
of
the
most
restless
of
mortals
would
amuse
himself
as
long
as
he
could
endure
it
at
the
pastimes
we
had
devised
then
suddenly
cease
playing
and
commence
pacing
the
floor
like
a
caged
bear
when
this
too
grew
unendurable
he
would
stop
at
the
door
and
say
in
the
most
piteous
tones
of
course
meant
only
for
us
to
hear
o
kind
sir
please
let
me
out
the
feeling
he
expressed
was
shared
by
all
never
before
could
i
realize
the
full
value
of
liberty
and
the
horror
of
confinement
even
in
the
prisons
where
we
had
hitherto
been
the
novelty
of
our
situation
the
frequency
of
our
removals
and
the
bustle
and
excitement
of
the
trial
prevented
the
blank
monotony
of
imprisonment
from
settling
down
on
us
as
it
did
here
when
the
first
few
weeks
had
rolled
by
and
no
intimations
of
our
fate
reached
us
it
was
like
the
stillness
and
the
death
that
brood
over
the
dead
sea
we
would
sit
at
the
windows
in
the
sultry
noon
and
look
out
through
the
bars
at
the
free
birds
as
they
flew
past
seemingly
so
merry
and
full
of
joyous
life
and
foolishly
wish
that
we
too
were
birds
that
we
might
fly
away
and
be
at
peace
at
long
intervals
two
of
us
would
be
permitted
to
go
down
into
the
yard
to
do
our
washing
one
day
it
came
my
turn
it
was
then
three
months
since
i
had
stepped
out
of
my
room
and
the
unobscured
vision
of
open
air
and
sky
made
it
seem
like
another
world
i
remember
looking
up
at
the
snowy
clouds
my
eyes
almost
dazzled
by
the
unusual
light
and
wondering
as
i
gazed
on
their
beautiful
and
changing
forms
whether
beyond
them
lay
a
world
of
rest
in
which
were
neither
wars
nor
prisons
and
with
the
thought
came
the
fear
that
if
i
was
once
more
permitted
to
mingle
as
a
free
man
away
from
the
immediate
pressure
of
danger
with
the
busy
throng
of
life
i
would
forget
my
vows
and
thus
lose
my
claim
to
a
world
of
light
such
a
sense
of
weakness
and
helplessness
came
over
me
that
it
was
with
a
feeling
almost
of
relief
that
i
returned
once
more
to
my
dark
and
narrow
room
where
the
contrast
between
freedom
and
bondage
was
less
palpably
forced
on
my
view
all
this
time
we
hardly
permitted
ourselves
to
indulge
a
hope
of
ever
getting
home
again
the
friends
we
once
knew
in
happier
days
seemed
separated
from
us
by
an
impassable
gulf
and
when
our
minds
would
call
up
before
us
the
scenes
and
loved
ones
of
home
it
was
like
treading
on
forbidden
ground
but
when
the
miseries
of
the
day
were
passed
and
we
were
wrapped
in
that
sweet
slumber
that
ever
visits
the
weary
alike
in
prison
and
palace
there
was
no
longer
any
restraint
and
we
were
once
more
at
home
once
more
in
the
enjoyment
of
love
and
freedom
often
have
i
seen
in
dreams
the
streets
and
buildings
of
my
own
town
rise
before
me
and
have
felt
a
thrilling
pleasure
in
contemplating
them
as
i
wended
my
way
towards
the
sacred
precincts
for
ever
hallowed
by
affection
but
the
waking
from
these
incursions
into
the
realms
of
paradise
was
sad
beyond
measure
and
the
cold
bare
walls
of
prison
never
looked
half
so
dreary
as
when
seen
in
contrast
with
the
visions
which
had
just
been
dispersed
by
the
morning
light
an
anecdote
here
will
fitly
illustrate
the
affection
and
exaggerated
reverence
we
felt
for
what
we
to
the
great
annoyance
of
the
guards
and
citizens
insisted
on
calling
god
country
i
had
been
reading
one
of
bascom
sermons
from
a
book
which
the
minister
had
loaned
us
on
the
joys
of
heaven
all
listened
to
his
magnificent
description
with
the
greatest
of
interest
and
when
it
was
finished
some
one
started
the
query
as
to
whether
they
would
rather
be
in
heaven
safe
from
all
harm
or
in
cincinnati
after
a
debate
which
was
conducted
with
great
animation
on
both
sides
the
majority
concluded
no
doubt
honestly
that
they
would
rather
be
in
cincinnati
for
a
while
at
least
in
order
to
keep
thoroughly
posted
we
opened
communications
to
every
room
in
the
prison
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
entry
we
reached
by
means
of
a
small
stick
attached
to
a
string
and
thrown
under
the
door
there
was
a
chimney
came
up
between
our
room
and
the
other
on
the
same
side
of
the
entry
each
of
our
led
into
this
chimney
at
points
directly
opposite
and
by
taking
off
the
pipes
we
could
talk
through
but
there
was
danger
of
being
overheard
to
obviate
this
we
split
a
long
lath
off
the
side
of
our
room
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
able
to
take
it
down
and
put
it
up
at
pleasure
this
we
used
for
passing
notes
backward
and
forward
through
this
concealed
passage
and
it
became
very
useful
when
we
afterward
contemplated
an
escape
one
morning
the
guard
brought
up
some
prisoners
and
as
soon
as
they
had
retired
we
resorted
to
our
usual
method
of
telegraphing
to
ascertain
their
character
to
our
great
surprise
and
pleasure
we
found
that
two
of
them
were
from
the
tenth
wisconsin
a
regiment
in
our
own
brigade
they
told
us
that
we
had
long
since
been
given
up
for
dead
and
that
our
comrades
were
vowing
vengeance
for
our
murder
they
were
quite
surprised
to
find
so
many
of
us
still
alive
the
other
two
were
regulars
who
had
been
captured
on
the
coast
of
florida
these
soldiers
remained
with
us
till
we
were
taken
to
richmond
from
them
we
gained
a
complete
detail
of
the
movements
of
our
army
since
we
had
left
it
all
our
friends
at
home
believed
we
were
executed
my
obituary
notice
was
published
in
our
county
paper
and
the
rev
alexander
clark
was
invited
to
preach
my
funeral
sermon
which
providential
circumstances
alone
prevented
one
of
the
hardest
things
we
had
to
endure
was
the
rejoicing
that
accompanied
mcclellan
flight
from
richmond
before
this
occurrence
the
secessionists
were
and
despairing
but
afterward
they
were
jubilant
about
the
last
of
may
a
prominent
officer
said
to
me
any
other
officer
of
yours
but
mcclellan
would
now
take
richmond
for
we
have
not
men
enough
at
present
to
offer
successful
resistance
but
will
fortify
each
step
of
his
way
and
lay
grand
plans
and
thus
delay
until
we
can
raise
men
enough
by
the
conscript
law
to
defeat
him
i
did
not
then
think
that
his
prediction
would
be
verified
and
hoped
that
mcclellan
would
show
that
he
was
not
delaying
for
nothing
but
when
i
heard
of
the
precipitate
retreat
to
landing
i
was
ready
to
confess
that
the
confederate
officer
had
been
more
penetrating
in
his
views
than
myself
from
this
moment
the
tide
of
victory
seemed
to
set
to
the
southward
side
with
a
still
deeper
and
stronger
flow
till
the
next
spring
when
it
returned
again
i
can
preserve
no
order
of
time
in
relating
the
events
of
these
tedious
mouths
which
slowly
rolled
away
their
ponderous
length
it
was
almost
a
perfect
isolation
from
the
world
with
little
hope
of
ever
again
mingling
in
its
busy
throng
as
each
month
closed
we
were
startled
by
the
thought
we
were
still
alive
that
the
bolt
had
not
yet
descended
and
we
surmised
and
wondered
how
much
longer
it
could
be
delayed
at
last
a
small
ray
of
hope
began
to
arise
very
feeble
at
first
based
on
the
long
and
incomprehensible
reprieve
we
were
enjoying
as
week
after
week
glided
tediously
away
marked
only
by
the
monotony
which
is
more
wearying
to
heart
and
frame
than
the
most
severe
anguish
this
hope
grew
stronger
yet
still
so
little
assured
that
the
most
trifling
circumstance
such
as
strengthening
the
guard
or
a
visit
from
the
officers
was
sufficient
to
blast
the
hopes
we
were
beginning
so
fondly
to
cherish
i
saw
many
instances
of
the
iron
rule
with
which
the
southern
union
men
are
kept
in
subjection
the
strictest
espionage
was
maintained
through
every
order
of
society
the
spies
of
the
government
would
pretend
to
be
union
men
and
thus
worm
themselves
into
loyal
societies
and
when
they
had
learned
the
names
of
the
members
would
denounce
them
to
the
government
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
particular
about
truth
as
the
suspicion
of
guilt
in
their
mode
of
procedure
was
just
as
good
as
its
positive
evidence
one
day
seventy
men
and
twelve
women
were
arrested
and
sent
in
irons
to
richmond
many
other
instances
of
this
remorseless
tyranny
will
be
given
hereafter
most
of
our
boys
were
and
were
driven
to
numberless
expedients
to
obtain
that
which
some
of
them
declared
they
valued
more
than
their
daily
food
there
were
several
articles
of
which
the
rebels
had
not
seen
fit
to
rob
us
such
as
handkerchiefs
and
a
few
vests
these
were
now
sold
to
the
surrounding
guards
andrews
had
given
hawkins
a
very
large
fine
coat
and
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
prospect
of
taking
it
home
he
sold
it
to
the
jailor
and
invested
the
proceeds
in
tobacco
apples
which
he
generously
divided
among
his
comrades
i
wanted
books
more
than
anything
else
and
sold
my
vest
and
a
the
rebels
had
left
when
they
took
what
was
in
it
and
bought
three
books
all
gems
paradise
lost
pilgrim
progress
and
pollock
course
of
time
these
i
nearly
committed
to
memory
it
was
a
profitable
employment
while
i
am
sure
it
very
much
lightened
and
shortened
these
interminable
days

we
frequently

about
making

all
agreed
that
if
they
should
proceed
to
try
us
we
should
make
one
desperate
effort
for
life
for
we
had
learned
by
sad
experience
that
they
did
not
take
the
trouble
of
going
to
the
formality
of
a
trial
unless
they
were
fully
resolved
to
hang
the
accused
but
as
time
rolled
on
and
the
dreaded
preparations
for
trial
were
not
made
the
imprisonment
became
daily
more
unendurable
the
food
was
of
a
poorer
quality
and
more
scanty
at
that
it
was
therefore
proposed
that
we
should
make
a
bold
strike
for
freedom
the
question
was
a
serious
one
on
the
one
hand
was
the
bright
prize
of
liberty
of
which
none
ever
knew
the
value
better
than
we
shining
ahead
as
the
sure
reward
of
success
but
on
the
other
hand
was
the
danger
of
failure
we
were
in
the
very
center
of
the
confederacy
and
the
nearest
point
where
we
could
reach
our
lines
was
two
hundred
miles
distant
this
journey
had
to
be
made
through
the
enemy
country
and
by
traveling
at
night
with
no
guide
but
the
stars
which
the
envious
clouds
might
conceal
from
us
for
many
successive
nights
as
they
had
done
before
then
there
was
the
probability
that
those
who
were
retaken
would
be
mercilessly
dealt
with
if
not
instantly
put
to
death
it
was
a
grave
question
and
then
the
great
heat
of
the
days
added
to
our
enfeebled
condition
caused
by
the
close
confinement
and
the
meagre
character
of
our
diet
as
well
as
the
actual
sickness
of
some
of
our
party
including
myself
induced
me
to
believe
that
the
attempt
should
at
least
be
postponed
still
day
by
day
we
discussed
the
subject
it
afforded
us
an
inexhaustible
theme
for
conversation
and
had
this
further
advantage
that
all
the
knowledge
possessed
by
the
party
collectively
was
communicated
to
each
one
besides
the
plans
were
laid
by
which
to
avoid
pursuit
and
all
possible
information
respecting
the
country
obtained
from
the
guards
and
negroes
and
then
we
felt
quite
prepared
for
the
issue
when
it
should
come
at
last
we
received
a
piece
of
intelligence
which
made
us
resolve
to
hesitate
no
longer
colonel
lee
came
to
our
room
one
morning
and
after
talking
some
time
told
us
that
he
had
just
received
a
letter
from
the
secretary
of
war
asking
why
the
party
had
not
been
executed
he
had
answered
that
he
did
not
know
but
referred
him
to
the
which
had
tried
our
comrades
at
knoxville
this
court
had
dispersed
long
before
and
i
feel
hopeful
that
many
of
the
perjured
villains
have
fallen
beneath
the
avenging
bullets
of
union
soldiers
so
the
secretary
could
not
have
obtained
much
information
from
them
a
few
days
after
we
received
still
further
and
more
alarming
information
one
of
the
regular
soldiers
in
the
adjoining
room
overheard
the
officer
of
the
guard
telling
the
jailor
that
colonel
lee
had
received
another
letter
from
the
secretary
ordering
our
immediate
execution
this
was
duly
telegraphed
to
us
through
the
and
at
once
put
an
end
to
all
our
deliberations
the
time
had
come
for
us
to
save
ourselves
or
perish
quietly
we
sat
down
and
arranged
our
plans
we
were
in
an
upper
story
and
several
locked
doors
had
to
be
opened
before
we
could
reach
the
ground
there
were
seven
guards
keeping
watch
over
us
and
a
large
force
near
by
ready
to
rush
to
their
assistance
at
the
slightest
notice
it
was
evident
that
our
only
chance
of
success
lay
in
moving
very
quickly
and
silently
we
could
not
leave
at
night
for
then
all
the
doors
were
closed
and
we
had
no
means
of
opening
them
the
best
time
was
at
supper
which
was
brought
a
little
before
sundown
and
by
starting
then
we
would
soon
have
the
cover
of
darkness
to
conceal
our
flight
the
soldiers
in
the
next
room
and
a
deserter
who
was
confined
with
them
agreed
to
go
with
us
if
we
would
open
their
door
only
one
of
the
tennesseeans
named
barlow
would
risk
the
trial
although
they
were
anxious
for
the
movement
before
it
was
seriously
contemplated
the
plan
on
which
we
finally
settled
was
to
seize
the
jailor
when
he
came
to
take
out
the
buckets
in
which
our
supper
was
brought
holding
him
so
that
he
could
make
no
noise
take
the
keys
from
him
and
let
buffum
unlock
the
doors
and
release
the
remaining
prisoners
while
this
was
being
done
our
other
boys
would
divide
into
two
squads
and
cautiously
descending
the
stairway
pounce
upon
the
guards
and
take
their
guns
from
them
then
at
a
signal
we
would
all
come
down
and
march
thus
armed
on
our
homeward
journey
we
very
nearly
succeeded
in
our
programme
the
second
day
after
receiving
the
news
all
our
plans
were
completed
we
had
patched
our
clothes
as
best
we
could
and
made
cloth
moccasins
to
protect
our
feet
for
many
of
our
shoes
were
altogether
worn
out
now
we
only
awaited
the
approach
of
the
appointed
hour
slowly
the
sun
rolled
down
the
west
slowly
the
shadows
lengthened
in
the
east
till
the
gloomy
shade
of
the
jail
had
nearly
reached
the
crest
of
the
hill
which
usually
marked
our
supper
time
the
eventful
hour
drew
nigh
we
bade
one
another
a
solemn
farewell
for
we
knew
not
when
we
should
meet
again
on
earth
or
how
many
of
us
might
be
cold
and
lifeless
before
the
stars
shone
out
captain
fry
who
was
as
a
child
wept
at
the
parting
he
had
two
coats
and
as
he
could
not
take
both
with
him
he
gave
one
to
me
i
needed
it
extremely
for
i
was
very
nearly
destitute
of
clothing
everything
was
now
in
readiness
i
had
piled
up
the
books
of
the
minister
some
of
which
we
still
retained
in
the
corner
and
had
written
him
a
note
thanking
him
for
the
use
of
them
we
had
on
our
coats
and
had
a
few
canes
and
bottles
and
pieces
of
lath
taken
out
of
the
wall
which
were
to
be
used
in
the
fight
down
stairs
if
necessary
then
came
the
supper
it
was
brought
in
by
negroes
the
jailor
standing
at
the
door
our
preparations
for
leaving
were
not
noticed
we
ate
in
silence
stowing
part
of
the
bread
in
our
pockets
for
future
emergencies
it
so
happened
that
the
old
watchman
whom
everybody
hated
was
away
it
was
well
for
him
as
he
would
have
received
little
mercy
after
the
jailor
had
given
their
food
to
the
inmates
of
the
other
rooms
he
came
back
to
ours
we
asked
him
to
let
barlow
come
over
and
stay
with
us
that
night
he
consented
and
soon
barlow
was
with
us
now
was
the
time
for
action
it
was
a
thrilling
moment
on
the
action
of
the
next
few
minutes
hung
the
issues
probably
of
life
or
death
i
confess
that
for
one
moment
the
blood
flowed
to
my
heart
with
a
sharp
throb
of
pain
the
others
were
pale
but
determined
as
for
captain
fry
who
was
to
initiate
the
movement
and
whom
i
had
seen
weeping
a
few
minutes
before
he
was
perfectly
calm
and
his
face
wore
a
pleasant
smile
he
stepped
out
of
the
door
as
if
it
was
the
most
natural
action
in
the
world
and
said
very
quietly
a
pleasant
evening
mr
turner
yes
rather
pleasant
responded
the
latter
looking
as
if
he
could
not
understand
what
fry
was
out
there
for
we
feel
like
taking
a
little
walk
this
evening
continued
the
captain
the
astonishment
of
the
jailor
now
knew
no
bounds
how
where
he
exclaimed
in
broken
ejaculations
fry
countenance
grew
darker
as
he
clasped
the
old
man
in
his
arms
and
said
we
have
stayed
as
long
as
we
can
stand
it
and
we
now
are
going
to
leave
and
let
out
the
other
prisoners
so
give
up
the
keys
and
make
no
noise
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
turner
tightened
his
grasp
on
the
keys
desperately
and
exclaimed
you
ca
do
that
then
commenced
in
a
loud
tone
guar
when
my
hand
closed
across
his
mouth
and
stifled
the
incipient
call
for
help
it
was
not
our
intention
to
hurt
the
old
man
for
he
had
been
kind
to
us
but
it
was
necessary
to
keep
him
quiet
he
possessed
great
strength
and
struggled
very
hard
managing
to
bite
my
finger
but
we
held
him
fast
and
easily
wrestled
the
keys
from
him
buffum
was
soon
at
work
on
the
locks
of
the
doors
meantime
our
companions
had
quietly
descended
the
stairway
and
burst
out
on
the
guards
there
were
seven
of
them
but
they
were
so
much
taken
by
surprise
as
to
be
incapable
of
resistance
our
boys
divided
into
two
parties
one
for
the
front
and
the
other
for
the
back
door
the
latter
was
completely
successful
capturing
the
guard
and
taking
their
guns
from
them
without
the
least
alarm
being
given
the
attack
at
the
front
door
was
made
with
equal
skill
and
bravery
and
the
guards
who
stood
near
were
at
once
secured
unfortunately
there
were
two
in
the
yard
gate
which
happened
to
be
open
as
soon
as
these
saw
the
charge
made
they
without
waiting
to
attempt
resistance
ran
through
the
gate
shrieking
help
murder
in
tones
that
aroused
the
whole
neighborhood
there
were
troops
near
at
hand
who
instantly
rushed
to
the
rescue
our
boys
saw
their
peril
and
knew
that
the
part
of
our
scheme
which
provided
for
a
regular
and
quiet
departure
was
defeated
and
they
endeavored
to
save
themselves
they
threw
away
the
guns
which
now
would
only
hinder
their
flight
and
scaled
the
wall
some
ten
feet
in
hight
and
made
for
the
woods
nearly
a
mile
distant
it
was
a
close
chase
several
times
they
were
fired
on
by
the
pursuing
rebels
but
fortunately
not
hit
we
who
were
above
heard
the
noise
and
were
admonished
by
it
to
take
our
leave
as
soon
as
possible
buffum
had
just
succeeded
in
unlocking
the
door
that
kept
in
our
other
soldiers
who
at
once
came
out
the
deserter
confined
with
them
who
was
the
most
powerful
and
active
of
the
whole
party
also
broke
out
and
passed
by
where
fry
and
myself
still
held
the
jailor
like
a
tiger
on
the
leap
when
he
reached
the
yard
he
found
two
soldiers
before
him
with
their
bayonets
at
a
charge
without
a
moment
hesitation
he
seized
them
cutting
his
hands
severely
but
dashing
them
aside
with
such
violence
as
nearly
to
throw
the
rebels
from
their
feet
and
bounded
on
his
way
his
almost
incredible
swiftness
soon
placed
him
in
advance
of
all
the
fugitives
captain
fry
and
i
started
down
stairs
together
he
was
a
little
in
advance
and
at
once
saw
there
was
no
chance
in
the
front
yard
which
was
now
filled
with
armed
rebels
and
darted
to
the
back
door
here
he
scaled
the
wall
just
in
time
to
get
away
after
a
most
desperate
chase
being
repeatedly
fired
upon
by
the
guards
who
were
only
a
few
feet
from
him
but
fortunately
was
unharmed
i
did
not
so
soon
comprehend
the
state
of
affairs
probably
because
i
am
and
rushed
to
the
front
yard
here
i
saw
two
rebels
who
seemed
perfectly
distracted
and
were
throwing
their
guns
wildly
about
and
exclaiming
what
shall
we
do
o
what
shall
we
do
not
thinking
them
very
dangerous
i
darted
past
them
but
was
checked
by
a
stream
of
less
frightened
guards
pouring
through
the
gate
seeing
then
that
there
was
no
chance
of
escape
in
that
direction
i
turned
and
regained
the
jail
one
man
snapped
his
gun
at
me
but
fortunately
it
did
not
go
off
i
instantly
tried
the
back
yard
and
succeeded
in
getting
to
the
top
of
the
wall
but
here
i
found
that
the
rebels
had
again
been
too
fast
for
me
and
were
around
under
the
wall
outside
under
these
circumstances
i
could
do
no
better
than
surrender
i
was
taken
back
to
prison
and
instead
of
going
to
my
own
room
went
to
that
occupied
by
the
prisoners
of
war
who
had
all
been
recaptured
and
put
in
again
buffum
too
who
had
managed
to
get
over
the
wall
was
retaken
and
brought
back
parrott
and
reddick
were
captured
inside
of
the
wall
and
mason
and
bensinger
the
next
day
making
six
of
our
party
who
were
retaken
from
the
window
where
i
was
i
had
a
good
view
of
all
the
proceedings
below
in
a
very
short
time
the
whole
force
of
the
place
including
a
regiment
of
cavalry
was
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
jail
i
heard
colonel
lee
the
give
his
orders
he
said
take
one
of
the
villains
alive
shoot
them
down
and
let
them
lie
in
the
woods
for
the
birds
and
hogs
to
eat
he
also
ordered
pickets
to
be
placed
at
the
ferries
of
the
chattahoochie
along
the
railroad
and
at
all
this
arrangement
pleased
me
for
these
were
the
very
places
we
had
agreed
to
avoid
and
i
was
sure
none
of
the
boys
would
be
caught
there
our
intention
had
been
to
travel
in
the
night
time
through
the
woods
and
cross
the
rivers
on
logs
as
far
from
the
ferries
as
possible
eight
escaped
wood
and
wilson
traveled
southward
and
after
passing
through
a
series
of
the
most
startling
adventures
that
recall
the
old
indian
tales
we
have
all
listened
to
in
the
winter
evenings
they
succeeded
in
reaching
the
gulf
where
they
were
taken
on
board
a
united
states
ship
and
brought
around
to
washington
porter
and
wollam
started
westward
their
journey
was
a
most
perilous
one
i
will
insert
a
short
account
which
porter
has
since
furnished
me
we
started
on
the
of
october
and
reached
the
federal
lines
on
the
of
november
during
this
time
we
endured
all
the
hardships
imaginable
we
traveled
night
and
day
sleeping
mostly
in
the
woods
and
subsisting
on
wild
grapes
chestnuts
walnuts
and
some
few
sweet
potatoes
occasionally
we
got
a
little
from
the
poor
class
of
whites
and
the
negroes
it
was
miserable
stuff
several
times
we
slipped
into
the
fields
where
the
negroes
were
at
work
and
stole
the
provisions
they
had
brought
out
for
their
dinner
once
we
were
seven
days
without
a
bite
of
bread
and
often
went
without
for
two
or
three
days
we
suffered
much
with
cold
for
our
clothes
were
very
poor
we
slept
but
twice
in
houses
during
the
whole
journey
one
night
we
traveled
till
we
became
chilled
and
weary
it
was
very
late
and
we
were
nearly
frozen
when
we
fortunately
discovered
nest
of
immediately
we
routed
them
up
and
lying
down
in
the
warm
retreat
they
had
left
slept
till
morning
many
streams
were
in
our
way
which
we
were
obliged
to
wade
or
float
across
on
logs
after
days
of
such
privations
we
reached
the
tennessee
river
miles
below
bridgeport
here
we
pressed
a
canoe
into
the
service
and
started
down
the
river
we
would
run
the
canoe
at
night
and
hide
it
and
ourselves
in
the
day
time
when
we
arrived
at
the
head
of
the
muscle
shoals
we
were
compelled
to
abandon
our
canoe
on
account
of
low
water
and
make
a
circuit
of
forty
miles
around
when
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
shoals
we
procured
a
skiff
and
continued
our
voyage
until
within
twelve
miles
of
pittsburg
landing
here
we
left
the
river
and
striking
across
the
country
to
corinth
reached
there
in
safety
thus
after
six
months
of
suffering
we
were
once
more
under
the
glorious
flag
of
the
free
these
will
serve
as
specimens
of
what
the
brave
boys
endured
in
the
truly
herculean
task
of
penetrating
for
hundreds
of
miles
in
fact
from
the
very
center
of
the
confederacy
to
its
circumference
in
different
directions
it
is
an
achievement
i
can
not
look
upon
without
wonder
and
in
dangers
to
be
encountered
and
difficulties
to
be
overcome
is
at
least
equal
to
the
proudest
exploits
of
park
or
livingstone
hawkins
and
myself
associated
and
made
good
our
escape
we
think
all
our
party
escaped
to
the
woods
whether
any
were
afterward
caught
by
the
rebels
we
know
not
we
traveled
by
starlight
for
more
than
three
weeks
after
days
of
fatigue
and
hunger
living
most
of
the
time
on
corn
or
persimmons
occasionally
a
few
raw
sweet
potatoes
or
a
head
of
cabbage
dodging
the
rebel
pickets
and
cavalry
climbing
mountains
dragging
through
brush
and
wading
streams
we
finally
were
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
some
union
men
in
the
cumberland
mountains
we
met
them
three
in
number
in
the
woods
and
asked
them
to
give
us
some
supper
stating
that
we
had
no
money
but
we
belonged
to
the
rebel
army
had
been
sick
and
left
behind
and
were
now
on
our
way
to
rejoin
our
regiments
they
refused
to
supply
our
wants
and
finally
openly
declared
themselves
to
be
union
men
when
we
became
satisfied
that
they
were
all
right
we
made
known
our
true
character
and
warmer
friends
were
never
met
they
lodged
and
fed
us
then
piloted
us
to
another
union
man
who
did
the
same
and
he
to
another
thus
we
were
passed
from
one
to
another
till
we
arrived
at
somerset
kentucky
where
we
procured
transportation
to
our
from
an
account
published
by
all
night
long
the
guards
talked
over
their
adventures
generally
they
praised
their
own
bravery
to
the
skies
but
occasionally
one
who
had
arrived
since
the
affray
would
suggest
that
it
was
not
very
much
to
their
credit
to
let
unarmed
men
snatch
their
guns
from
them
but
these
hinted
slanders
were
always
received
with
the
contempt
they
deserved
and
the
work
of
went
on
one
wondered
at
the
speed
of
the
yankees
who
had
been
kept
in
prison
so
long
another
accounted
for
it
by
saying
that
they
had
received
so
much
practice
in
that
line
in
all
the
battles
they
had
fought
that
it
was
no
wonder
if
they
were
fleet
of
foot
this
sally
was
received
with
prodigious
applause
i
heard
some
confused
sounds
of
distress
from
the
room
of
the
tennesseeans
and
on
inquiring
what
was
the
matter
learned
that
barlow
had
broken
his
ankle
he
had
gone
down
into
the
yard
with
our
party
but
in
jumping
from
the
wall
had
received
this
very
serious
injury
here
he
was
found
by
a
guard
who
at
first
threatened
to
shoot
him
but
on
being
persuaded
not
to
do
that
ordered
him
to
get
up
and
lead
the
way
into
the
jail
barlow
tried
to
do
so
but
fell
down
again
then
this
inhuman
guard
punched
him
with
the
bayonet
and
made
him
crawl
in
all
the
agony
that
pain
could
produce
back
to
his
cell
and
as
he
went
kept
hurrying
him
along
by
the
sharp
admonition
of
the
bayonet
when
here
his
companions
asked
for
surgical
aid
for
him
but
the
confederate
authorities
refused
it
saying
that
he
had
caused
the
injury
himself
and
that
they
rather
preferred
that
it
should
kill
him
their
wishes
were
gratified
for
months
he
lingered
on
in
the
greatest
pain
until
finally
the
leg
mortified
and
terminated
his
life
he
was
quite
a
young
man
only
eighteen
and
had
just
been
married
when
he
was
arrested

regulars
had
swung
by
the

and
listened
to
the
boasting
below
sadly
i
thought
of
the
morrow
i
had
little
doubt
now
that
the
full
weight
of
their
vengeance
would
fall
on
every
one
who
had
been
recaptured
and
then
too
was
the
news
we
had
received
and
which
had
induced
us
to
make
our
desperate
effort
to
escape
we
could
scarcely
hope
that
the
death
which
had
so
long
stared
us
in
the
face
would
now
be
longer
delayed
and
a
death
no
vision

dazzle
the
sight
and

grim
monster
from
view

no

struggle
and
sure
if
you
acted
well
your
part
to
tell
it
to
those
whose
love
and
praise
were
more
than
life
nothing
but
ignominy
and
an
impenetrable
darkness
beyond
which
no
loving
eye
might
ever
pierce
but
even
as
the
cold
horror
of
the
scaffold
and
the
vision
of
the
heartless
jeering
crowd
rose
once
more
freshly
before
me
i
looked
out
in
the
clear
night
and
up
to
the
shining
stars
and
felt
that
i
had
one
friend
that
he
who
dwelt
above
the
stars
and
to
whom
i
had
plighted
my
faith
would
not
forsake
me
even
if
i
had
to
pass
through
the
very
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
with
the
thought
came
a
still
and
heavenly
peace
once
more
a
peace
that
visits
only
those
who
feel
in
the
midst
of
sorrow
and
fear
that
there
is
a
blissful
rest
beyond
the
night
bounding
life
fleeting
day
the
next
morning
the
jailor
put
me
in
the
room
i
had
formerly
occupied
with
the
remainder
of
my
companions
he
told
us
that
a
man
had
put
his
hand
over
his
mouth
and
nearly
smothered
him
but
added
with
great
satisfaction
i
bit
his
finger
terribly
and
gave
the
rascal
a
mark
he
will
carry
to
the
grave
with
him
however
his
teeth
were
not
so
sharp
as
he
thought
and
he
only
managed
to
inflict
a
slight
scratch
he
had
no
suspicion
that
i
was
the
person
to
whom
he
referred
as
his
fright
had
prevented
him
from
observing
anything
for
a
while
he
was
rather
cross
and
brought
up
the
guards
when
he
came
to
feed
us
but
this
soon
wore
off
about
the
middle
of
the
day
some
officers
came
and
with
many
threats
asked
us
which
way
our
boys
intended
to
travel
i
answered
i
heard
them
say
that
they
were
going
to
try
to
get
to
our
lines
and
that
traveling
in
direction
would
bring
them
there
for
our
men
had
you
surrounded
they
asked
no
more
questions
but
retired
satisfied
that
there
was
no
information
to
be
gained
our
anticipations
of
worse
treatment
in
consequence
of
our
attempted
escape
were
not
realized
colonel
lee
thought
the
jail
was
no
longer
a
safe
place
and
ordered
us
to
be
taken
to
the
city
barracks
our
apartment
here
was
far
more
pleasant
than
our
quarters
in
the
jail
had
been
it
was
large
well
lighted
and
provided
with
a
which
the
chilliness
of
the
days
it
was
now
in
october
made
a
great
acquisition
it
also
commanded
a
view
of
one
of
the
busiest
public
squares
of
atlanta
and
we
would
sit
in
the
windows
which
had
no
bars
across
them
and
watch
the
tide
of
human
life
that
flowed
before
us
for
hours
at
a
time
with
an
interest
that
only
our
long
seclusion
from
the
world
could
have
given
jack
wells
the
commander
of
the
barracks
had
been
an
old
united
states
soldier
being
thus
brought
up
under
a
more
honorable
system
than
obtains
in
the
south
at
present
he
did
not
consider
it
derogatory
to
his
dignity
to
treat
prisoners
kindly
he
would
come
around
to
our
room
and
talk
with
us
by
the
hour
telling
us
great
stories
of
his
adventures
and
receiving
as
great
in
return
most
of
the
time
he
was
half
drunk
and
very
frequently
did
not
stop
at
the
half
way
point
in
these
cases
and
when
he
was
in
a
communicative
mood
he
would
tell
us
that
he
did
not
care
a
cent
which
side
whipped
that
he
only
held
his
present
position
to
avoid
being
conscripted
but
his
masters
knew
him
to
be
such
a
faithful
vigilant
officer
and
he
could
so
readily
control
the
rude
mass
who
occupied
the
rebel
portion
of
the
barracks
that
they
readily
forgave
these
little
slips
of
the
tongue
we
passed
our
time
while
here
more
pleasantly
than
at
any
other
place
in
the
confederacy
yet
even
here
our
path
was
not
one
of
roses
the
following
incidents
will
prove
this
the
tennesseeans
were
confined
with
us
making
twenty
in
all
our
provisions
which
were
still
very
scanty
were
handed
around
in
a
tray
pierce
who
is
mentioned
before
one
time
conceived
his
allowance
to
be
too
small
and
threw
it
back
into
the
tray
again
not
a
word
was
spoken
on
either
side
but
in
a
few
minutes
the
guards
came
up
and
seizing
pierce
took
him
out
of
the
room
into
the
cold
hall
and
tying
his
hands
before
his
knees
with
a
stick
inserted
across
under
his
knees
and
over
his
arms
in
the
way
that
soldiers
call
bucking
they
left
him
there
all
night
this
indignity
was
perpetrated
on
an
old
man
over
sixty
one
of
the
guards
was
a
malicious
fellow
who
delighted
in
teasing
our
men
by
asking
them
how
they
liked
being
shut
up
in
a
prison
playing
checkers
with
their
noses
on
the
windows
one
day
when
he
was
talking
as
usual
a
tennesseean
named
barker
replied
that
need
not
be
so
proud
of
it
for
he
would
some
time
have
to
work
like
a
slave
in
the
to
help
pay
the
expenses
of
the
war
the
guard
reported
this
remark
to
the
commander
poor
barker
was
seized
and
taken
to
the
up
stairs
and
there
suspended
by
the
heels
till
he
fainted
then
let
down
until
he
revived
then
hung
up
again
this
was
continued
till
they
were
satisfied
when
he
was
taken
down
and
put
into
a
little
dark
dungeon
only
about
four
feet
square
and
there
kept
hours
with
nothing
to
eat
while
in
this
prison
i
had
the
heartfelt
pleasure
of
helping
one
man
to
escape
the
guards
and
indeed
all
the
poorer
class
of
southerners
were
very
illiterate
out
of
who
guarded
us
only
two
or
three
could
write
at
all
and
these
not
enough
to
be
of
any
service
wells
wrote
a
hand
that
nobody
but
himself
could
read
and
even
he
not
always
therefore
he
often
came
for
the
prisoners
to
write
short
articles
for
him
on
one
of
these
occasions
i
was
in
the
office
which
was
just
by
our
room
and
equally
guarded
writing
a
requisition
for
provisions
while
thus
engaged
a
man
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
a
rebel
officer
was
brought
in
for
confinement
in
the
barracks
he
appeared
to
be
very
drunk
but
remonstrated
so
hard
against
being
put
into
the
room
where
the
remainder
of
the
prisoners
were
kept
that
wells
consented
to
let
him
stay
for
a
while
in
his
office
his
money
was
not
taken
from
him
for
wells
not
knowing
the
charge
against
him
believed
he
was
arrested
only
for
being
drunk
an
offence
with
which
he
had
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
wells
had
some
business
to
attend
to
and
went
out
a
sergeant
was
with
us
but
he
too
soon
took
his
departure
leaving
us
alone
i
was
busy
writing
but
looking
up
i
saw
the
stranger
approaching
me
there
was
no
trace
of
drunkenness
about
him
i
watched
his
movements
attentively
soon
he
was
standing
by
me
you
are
a
prisoner
he
queried
yes
sir
one
they
call
he
continued
i
again
answered
in
the
affirmative
i
know
you
said
he
i
know
all
about
you
i
was
here
when
your
comrades
were
hung
brave
men
they
were
and
the
cruel
deed
will
yet
be
avenged
i
am
not
afraid
to
trust
you
they
do
yet
know
who
i
am
but
they
will
learn
and
then
if
i
am
still
in
their
hands
i
will
for
i
am
spy
from
the
federal
ca
you
help
me
to
escape
i
was
astonished
at
this
revelation
and
for
a
moment
doubted
his
character
thinking
that
his
aim
might
be
to
betray
me
for
a
selfish
advantage
i
put
a
few
hasty
questions
to
him
to
test
his
knowledge
of
the
federal
army
the
answers
were
satisfactory
and
seeing
nothing
but
truth
in
his
clear
eye
i
hesitated
no
longer
but
asked
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
answered
ca
you
write
me
a
pass
and
sign
the
commander
name
to
it
that
i
returned
would
probably
be
detected
but
i
think
i
can
put
you
on
a
better
plan
take
that
overcoat
pointing
to
one
belonging
to
wells
and
lying
on
the
foot
of
a
bed
put
it
around
you
and
just
walk
past
the
guards
as
independently
as
though
you
owned
the
entire
establishment
it
is
now
nearly
dark
and
the
chances
are
that
you
will
not
be
halted
by
the
guard
at
all
a
good
idea
said
he
i
try
it
at
once
folding
himself
in
the
coat
he
bade
me
an
affectionate
adieu
eagerly
i
sat
with
beating
heart
in
the
deepening
twilight
listening
for
any
sound
that
might
betray
the
success
or
failure
of
the
scheme
but
all
was
silence
i
have
since
learned
that
the
guard
seeing
the
familiar
coat
supposed
that
of
course
its
owner
was
in
it
and
allowed
it
to
pass
unchallenged
a
moment
after
the
sergeant
came
in
and
i
instantly
engaged
him
in
conversation
inducing
him
to
tell
some
good
stories
to
keep
him
from
missing
my
companion
and
to
allow
as
much
time
for
a
start
as
possible
before
the
inevitable
alarm
was
given
i
succeeded
perfectly
for
some
five
minutes
when
wells
came
in
threw
an
uneasy
glance
around
the
room
and
at
once
exclaimed
sergeant
where
is
that
officer
the
sergeant
protested
that
he
knew
nothing
about
him
that
he
was
not
in
the
room
when
he
entered
wells
then
turned
to
me
and
demanded
pittenger
where
that
officer
what
officer
that
officer
i
put
in
here
oh
that
drunken
fellow
yes
where
is
he
the
last
i
saw
of
him
he
picked
up
his
coat
and
said
he
was
going
to
supper
i
do
not
pretend
to
justify
the
falsehoods
recorded
in
this
book
but
it
is
better
to
give
a
narrative
and
bear
the
censure
awarded
by
the
reader
than
to
increase
the
guilt
by
omitting
or
misrepresenting
facts
going
to
supper
was
he
ho
i
see
it
sergeant
run
to
the
guards
and
tell
them
if
they
let
him
out
i
will
have
every
one
of
them
hung
up
by
the
heels
this
was
rather
a
useless
punishment
considering
that
the
prisoner
was
already
far
away
but
the
sergeant
departed
to
muster
the
guards
shortly
after
wells
who
had
resumed
his
seat
said
in
a
meditative
tone
had
he
a
coat
i
suppose
so
sir
i
returned
or
he
would
not
have
taken
it
where
did
he
get
it
off
the
foot
of
that
bed
wells
sprang
to
his
feet
as
quickly
as
though
he
had
been
galvanized
kicking
over
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
and
exclaimed
coat
sure
as
worth
eighty
dollars
the
villain
then
pressing
his
head
between
his
hands
sat
down
again
but
as
if
thinking
better
of
it
ejaculated
well
if
that
ai
a
cool
joke
and
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
which
ended
the
scene
there
are
some
facts
connected
with
the
union
sentiment
in
the
south
which
i
would
like
to
publish
if
i
dared
but
i
can
not
do
it
in
full
for
it
might
be
the
means
of
exposing
persons
who
befriended
us
to
the
vengeance
of
the
tyrant
rebels
i
will
only
say
that
there
exists
in
atlanta
a
society
of
over
four
hundred
members
who
are
still
devoted
to
the
cause
of
union
and
liberty
who
endure
in
patient
faith
all
the
cruel
persecutions
heaped
on
them
by
the
aristocrats
who
now
rule
their
beautiful
land
from
members
of
this
society
many
prisoners
as
well
as
myself
received
money
and
other
needed
articles
which
were
of
the
greatest
value
to
us
these
were
given
at
great
risk
to
the
donors
for
to
give
a
union
soldier
money
is
a
serious
criminal
offence
one
man
i
know
was
confined
for
four
months
on
the
mere
suspicion
of
having
aided
the
shiloh
prisoners
in
this
manner
my
impression
of
southern
feeling
is
very
different
from
vallandigham
but
the
union
men
were
my
friends
were
they
his
sweet
potatoes
were
very
abundant
in
atlanta
and
with
the
money
union
friends
supplied
us
we
bought
a
great
many
roasting
them
in
the
ashes
of
the
large
that
made
our
room
so
comfortable
they
added
materially
to
our
rations
and
rendered
our
living
here
more
tolerable
in
fact
had
it
not
been
for
that
universal
confederate
pest
with
which
all
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
seemed
supplied
sometimes
termed
the
rebel
body
guard
and
from
which
for
the
want
of
clean
clothes
no
exertions
of
ours
could
free
ourselves
we
might
have
passed
our
time
not
unpleasantly
we
still
continued
our
devotions
in
the
morning
and
evening
and
trust
that
god
blessed
them
to
us
we
met
with
occasional
hindrances
some
of
our
own
party
seemed
to
consider
that
our
release
from
the
dark
cells
of
a
criminal
prison
did
away
with
the
necessity
of
continued
prayer
the
confederates
also
annoyed
us
very
much
by
interruptions
while
thus
engaged
in
seeking
help
from
above
on
these
occasions
wells
was
our
friend
he
declared
that
he
could
not
stand
praying
himself
and
so
invariably
stayed
away
but
that
if
it
did
us
any
good
we
were
welcome
to
it
and
ought
not
to
be
disturbed
the
opposition
we
met
with
was
of
short
continuance
as
soon
as
they
found
us
firmly
resolved
on
our
own
course
they
did
as
all
cavilers
do
in
similar
circumstances
let
us
alone
thus
even
there
we
enjoyed
many
pleasant
moments
which
will
ever
be
remembered
as
a
green
oasis
in
the
parched
desert
of
while
here
the
confederates
wanted
some
of
us
to
enlist
in
their
army
they
tried
particularly
hard
to
get
the
regulars
wells
declaring
that
he
would
rather
have
the
two
than
any
half
dozen
of
his
own
men
they
pretended
not
to
be
unfavorable
to
the
scheme
but
delayed
complying
with
it
for
a
time
to
see
what
the
ultimate
prospects
of
an
exchange
might
be
the
cartel
of
exchange
had
been
agreed
upon
long
before
yet
these
men
who
had
no
charge
against
them
were
still
held
they
believed
that
it
was
because
they
were
with
us
and
that
the
rebels
feared
to
let
them
go
as
they
would
most
certainly
convey
to
our
government
intelligence
as
to
our
whereabouts
condition
and
treatment
this
view
appeared
still
more
probable
when
i
learned
since
returning
to
washington
that
the
confederate
government
had
denied
hanging
any
of
the
party
they
have
never
yet
acknowledged
it
the
time
wore
wearily
away
here
as
it
had
done
before
the
delay
since
the
death
of
our
friends
had
now
been
so
long
extended
that
we
began
to
believe
that
our
lives
might
be
spared
this
conviction
was
strengthened
as
the
months
rolled
on
at
last
a
was
convened
the
first
since
the
one
at
knoxville
and
we
awaited
its
action
with
the
utmost
anxiety
a
week
of
sickening
suspense
passed
by
and
no
summons
came
for
us
then
the
court
adjourned
and
we
breathed
freer
it
now
seemed
probable
that
they
did
not
intend
to
prosecute
the
feeble
remnant
of
our
party
any
further
and
passing
from
the
extreme
of
despair
to
that
of
hope
we
began
to
indulge
once
more
the
blissful
expectation
of
being
permitted
to
revisit
the
scenes
of
our
loved
north
and
stand
beneath
the
old
flag
which
we
honored
and
reverenced
as
the
embodiment
of
liberty
with
law
the
emblem
of
the
highest
national
life
but
our
time
for
freedom
had
not
yet
come
the
weeks
rolled
on
few
things
occurred
worthy
of
note
that
same
monotony
which
makes
so
dreary
robs
it
of
interest
when
recorded
we
would
rise
in
the
morning
from
our
hard
bed
and
wash
ourselves
pouring
the
water
upon
each
others
hands
and
eat
our
scanty
breakfast
then
loll
listlessly
around
seeking
in
vain
for
anything
which
might
relieve
the
almost
unendurable
tedium
when
dinner
came
which
was
of
the
same
quality
as
the
breakfast
we
would
eat
it
and
then
try
desperately
to
kill
time
until
dark
when
the
gas
was
lit
not
from
any
favor
to
us
but
that
the
guard
could
watch
us
from
the
door
and
see
that
we
were
working
no
plots
to
get
out
this
was
the
most
cheerful
hour
of
the
day
for
under
the
soft
inspiration
of
the
gaslight
conversation
flowed
more
freely
and
all
the
incidents
of
our
past
lives
were
rehearsed
to
attentive
listeners
to
vary
the
subject
an
argument
would
be
started
on
science
politics
or
religion
and
warmly
discussed
when
the
talk
would
flag
which
was
frequently
not
till
the
midnight
bells
were
striking
in
the
town
we
would
offer
up
our
devotions
and
lie
down
to
sleep
and
often
to
indulge
in
the
most
delightful
dreams
of
freedom
friends
and
home
in
the
morning
we
waked
again
and
the
same
round
was
recommenced
thus
days
glided
into
weeks
and
weeks
passed
into
months
the
light
golden
hues
of
autumn
deepened
into
the
dead
and
sombre
colors
of
early
winter
and
still
we
were
in
atlanta
our
weak
faith
judging
what
would
be
from
what
had
been
could
scarcely
conceive
that
we
would
ever
be
anywhere
else
a
heavy
dead
indifference
like
the
lack
of
sensibility
which
the
repeated
infliction
of
pain
produces
in
our
physical
natures
took
possession
of
us
we
almost
ceased
even
to
hope
but
at
last
there
came
a
day
of
rejoicing
a
number
of
officers
visited
the
barracks
and
inquired
which
was
the
room
occupied
by
the
federal
prisoners
on
being
shown
around
to
our
apartment
they
told
us
to
fall
into
line
and
then
said
they
had
glad
news
for
us
you
have
all
been
exchanged
and
all
that
now
remains
is
for
us
to
send
you
out
of
our
territory
they
then
came
along
the
lines
and
shook
hands
with
us
offering
congratulations
on
the
happy
termination
of
our
trials
and
wishing
us
much
joy
on
our
arrival
at
home
our
feelings
may
be
better
imagined
than
described
there
was
an
overwhelming
rush
of
emotions
which
forbade
utterance
happy
joy
exhilarating
and
yet
mingled
with
a
deep
touch
of
sorrow
that
our
seven
dead
murdered
comrades
were
not
with
us
to
share
the
joy
of
this
unexpected
release
and
the
eight
also
who
had
managed
to
get
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
rebels
by
their
own
daring
we
were
uneasy
about
them
only
a
day
or
two
before
we
had
seen
in
an
atlanta
paper
obtained
as
usual
through
a
source
an
article
clipped
from
the
giving
notice
of
the
arrival
of
porter
and
wollam
at
corinth
in
a
very
wretched
and
famished
condition
this
was
most
gratifying
to
us
but
of
the
others
we
had
as
yet
received
no
reliable
information
the
told
us
that
three
of
them
had
been
shot
and
left
in
the
woods
but
judging
by
the
source
we
considered
the
account
very
doubtful
and
still
cherished
the
hope
that
the
whole
story
was
a
fabrication
thus
we
were
in
suspense
as
to
their
fate
but
still
beyond
all
this
the
prospect
of
speedily
gaining
our
liberty
was
enough
to
make
our
hearts
overflow
with
gratitude
to
that
being
who
had
so
wonderfully
preserved
us
through
all
our
trials
i
was
so
agitated
that
when
wells
asked
me
to
write
a
requisition
for
provisions
for
our
journey
i
could
not
do
it
and
had
to
transfer
the
task
to
more
steady
hands
it
was
six
in
the
morning
when
we
received
the
news
and
we
were
to
start
for
home
richmond
at
seven
in
the
evening
we
spent
the
intervening
time
in
arranging
what
clothes
we
had
and
preparing
for
the
journey
and
as
the
time
for
departure
drew
near
we
again
lit
the
gas
and
built
a
fire
the
ruddy
blaze
of
which
was
itself
an
emblem
of
cheerfulness
to
take
a
farewell
view
of
the
room
in
which
we
had
spent
so
many
not
altogether
unhappy
hours
often
afterward
did
we
think
of
that
bright
hour
of
expectation
during
the
dreary
lapse
of
succeeding
months
which
we
were
still
doomed
to
pass
in
the
south
it
was
a
malicious
falsehood
all
were
safe
we
had
obtained
quite
a
number
of
pieces
of
carpet
which
served
as
blankets
but
were
forbidden
to
take
these
with
us
being
told
that
we
would
be
run
directly
through
and
would
soon
be
where
blankets
were
plenty
we
however
managed
to
secrete
two
very
small
pieces
which
were
afterwards
of
great
advantage
to
us
they
did
not
tie
us
now
for
the
first
time
in
all
our
travels
this
was
truly
remarkable
and
afforded
strong
confirmation
to
our
hopes
all
was
now
in
readiness
for
our
departure
and
we
took
a
long
and
i
trust
a
last
look
at
atlanta
at
least
while
it
remains
in
rebel
possession
the
guards
fell
in
on
each
side
of
us
and
we
wended
our
silent
way
along
the
dark
streets
wells
even
drunker
than
usual
accompanied
us
to
the
cars
where
he
hiccoughed
an
affectionate
farewell
white
the
sergeant
who
was
with
me
when
our
spy
escaped
commanded
our
escort
he
was
one
of
the
rebels
i
ever
saw
and
like
his
superior
did
not
care
which
side
came
out
best
so
long
as
he
was
not
hurt
the
guard
was
only
ten
in
number
while
we
including
the
tennesseeans
were
twenty
a
great
falling
off
in
precaution
from
their
former
custom
we
were
crowded
into
rude
and
soon
began
to
suffer
severely
with
the
cold
for
the
night
air
was
most
piercing
it
was
the
of
december
and
we
had
only
summer
clothing
which
was
in
addition
very
ragged
at
about
three
in
the
morning
we
arrived
at
dalton
we
were
not
to
go
through
chattanooga
the
stars
were
sparkling
in
light
and
frosty
brilliancy
when
we
stopped
the
other
train
on
which
we
were
to
continue
our
journey
had
not
yet
arrived
and
the
keen
and
icy
wind
cut
almost
through
us
we
stood
shivering
here
and
suffering
extremely
from
the
cold
for
something
like
an
hour
when
to
our
great
relief
the
expected
train
arrived
we
were
more
comfortably
fixed
in
it
and
managed
to
doze
away
the
time
till
daybreak
in
the
morning
we
found
that
our
three
days
rations
which
were
to
last
us
to
richmond
were
scarcely
enough
for
a
breakfast
however
we
ate
what
we
had
and
trusted
to
buying
a
few
necessaries
with
the
remaining
money
which
our
union
friends
had
given
us
when
that
failed
we
had
still
a
sure
resource
that
never
failed
endurance
of
hunger
during
the
day
we
discussed
the
question
whether
it
would
not
be
best
at
nightfall
to
try
making
our
escape
as
we
were
within
forty
miles
of
our
own
lines
it
would
be
an
easy
task
the
guards
were
perfectly
careless
and
at
any
time
we
could
have
had
as
many
guns
as
they
had
they
sat
on
the
same
seats
with
us
and
slept
frequently
those
guarding
the
doors
would
fall
asleep
and
we
would
wake
them
as
the
corporal
came
around
thus
saving
them
from
punishment
the
most
complete
security
seemed
to
pervade
them
utterly
forbidding
the
idea
that
thought
they
were
taking
us
onward
for
any
other
purpose
than
that
of
exchange
once
the
sergeant
laughingly
told
us
that
we
could
escape
if
we
wished
for
we
had
the
matter
in
our
own
hands
but
that
he
thought
it
would
be
more
pleasant
to
ride
on
around
than
to
walk
across
on
our
own
responsibility
this
very
security
lulled
our
suspicions
and
combined
with
what
the
marshal
and
other
officers
had
told
us
in
atlanta
induced
us
to
shrink
from
undertaking
a
journey
almost
naked
and
barefoot
as
some
of
us
were
over
the
mountains
and
in
the
snow
which
now
began
to
appear
in
the
afternoon
we
passed
the
town
of
knoxville
now
a
place
of
loathing
and
hatred
to
us
then
the
town
of
greenville
which
we
noticed
as
being
the
residence
of
our
heroic
companion
captain
fry
then
on
into
the
lower
part
of
western
virginia
it
was
nightfall
when
we
entered
this
state
and
a
beautiful
night
it
was
the
moon
shone
over
the
pale
cold
hills
with
a
mellow
silver
radiance
which
made
the
whole
landscape
enchanting
on
on
we
glided
over
hill
and
plain
at
the
dead
of
night
and
saw
in
the
shifting
scenery
of
the
panorama
without
a
representation
of
the
fleeting
visions
of
life
like
us
now
lost
in
some
dark
gloomy
wood
or
walled
in
by
the
encroaching
mountain
side
and
now
catching
a
magnificent
view
of
undulating
landscapes
far
away
in
the
shadowy
distance
thus
through
the
silent
night
we
journeyed
on
and
morning
dawned
on
us
still
steaming
through
the
romantic
valleys
of
virginia
the
next
day
was
a
wet
dreary
one
our
car
leaked
our
fire
went
out
and
we
were
most
thoroughly
uncomfortable
the
evening
found
us
at
the
mountain
city
of
lynchburg
which
is
literally
set
on
a
hill
here
we
discovered
that
we
had
missed
the
connection
and
would
have
to
wait
for
hours
we
were
very
sorry
for
this
as
we
were
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
to
our
own
lines
and
had
been
talking
all
the
way
about
what
we
should
do
when
we
arrived
at
washington
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
we
marched
up
to
the
barracks
with
as
good
grace
as
possible
we
here
found
a
large
room
with
some
of
the
refuse
of
the
confederate
army
in
it
there
was
an
immense
stove
in
the
center
of
the
room
but
being
without
fire
it
was
of
no
particular
benefit
we
resigned
ourselves
to
another
night
of
freezing
with
the
consoling
thought
that
we
would
not
have
many
more
of
such
to
endure
i
paced
the
floor
till
nearly
morning
and
witnessed
a
good
many
amusing
incidents
many
of
the
confederates
were
quite
drunk
and
disposed
to
be
mischievous
one
of
them
diverted
himself
by
walking
about
on
the
forms
of
those
who
were
trying
to
sleep
soon
he
came
around
to
bensinger
he
endured
the
infliction
patiently
the
first
time
but
as
the
sot
came
again
bensinger
was
on
the
and
springing
to
his
feet
gave
him
a
blow
that
laid
him
out
on
the
floor
some
of
his
companions
rushed
forward
to
resent
the
infliction
but
finding
that
nobody
was
frightened
they
gave
over
here
in
virginia
i
met
the
most
spiteful
and
venomous
secessionists
i
had
yet
seen
one
of
them
a
prisoner
said
that
he
had
advocated
raising
the
black
flag
asserting
that
if
it
had
been
done
at
first
the
war
would
have
been
over
long
since
no
doubt
of
it
i
replied
the
whole
southern
race
would
have
been
exterminated
long
before
this
this
way
of
ending
the
war
had
not
entered
his
mind
and
he
became
very
indignant
at
the
suggestion
all
the
next
day
was
cold
and
gloomy
after
noon
we
succeeded
in
obtaining
some
wood
for
the
big
stove
with
permission
to
make
a
fire
in
it
which
was
soon
done
and
a
genial
glow
diffused
over
the
whole
room
in
time
to
warm
us
before
taking
our
departure
for
richmond
we
started
a
while
before
dark
seated
in
good
comfortable
cars
the
best
we
enjoyed
on
the
route
but
we
only
ran
a
short
distance
to
a
junction
where
we
were
again
to
change
cars
the
next
train
had
not
yet
arrived
and
we
built
a
large
fire
as
it
still
continued
bitterly
cold
we
could
easily
have
escaped
for
the
passengers
mingled
with
us
around
the
fire
and
we
even
went
to
a
considerable
distance
away
to
procure
fuel
but
so
confident
were
we
of
a
speedy
exchange
that
we
did
not
make
the
effort
and
the
golden
opportunity
passed
unimproved
oh
how
greatly
we
afterward
regretted
that
we
had
not
at
least
made
the
attempt
soon
the
other
train
arrived
and
a
few
hours
placed
us
in
richmond
the
goal
to
which
every
union
soldier
is
turning
his
eyes
though
he
would
not
wish
to
reach
it

the

and
the

intense
and
piercing
cold
that
marked
our
journey
the
preceding
night
when
we
left
the
cars
and
entered
the
rebel
capital
everything
looked
grim
and
silent
through
the
frosty
air
and
our
teeth
chattered
fast
and
loud
as
we
walked
through
a
few
squares
of
this
now
historic
city
but
suddenly
the
sergeant
recollected
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
us
and
we
were
obliged
to
remain
where
we
were
till
he
could
find
the
office
and
get
instructions
we
endeavored
to
shelter
ourselves
as
best
we
could
from
the
unbearable
cold
which
really
threatened
to
prove
fatal
we
had
two
blankets
or
rather
pieces
of
carpet
and
we
spread
them
over
the
heads
of
us
all
as
we
huddled
together
in
a
solid
mass
in
the
angle
of
a
brick
wall
it
was
astonishing
how
much
more
comfortable
this
made
us
especially
in
the
inside
of
the
where
i
happened
to
be
here
we
remained
shivering
till
the
sergeant
returned
he
had
found
the
office
and
proceeded
to
conduct
us
thither
we
marched
through
several
of
the
principal
streets
which
but
for
the
moonlight
would
have
been
entirely
dark
at
last
we
arrived
at
the
office
which
to
add
to
our
discomfort
was
destitute
of
fire
we
stood
in
the
empty
room
looking
at
the
grim
portraits
of
the
rebel
generals
that
stared
at
us
from
the
walls
until
the
marshal
himself
entered
he
did
not
deign
to
speak
to
us
but
opened
a
sealed
letter
which
the
sergeant
handed
him
and
read
that
ten
disloyal
tennesseeans
four
prisoners
of
war
and
were
hereby
forwarded
to
richmond
by
order
of
general
beauregard
we
had
hoped
that
the
title
of
thieves
of
which
we
had
become
heartily
tired
would
now
be
left
behind
but
it
seemed
still
to
cling
to
us
and
afforded
an
unpleasant
premonition
of
the
confederacy
not
yet
being
done
with
us
the
marshal
then
gave
his
orders
and
we
were
again
marched
off
by
this
time
it
was
daylight
december
richmond
looked
still
more
cheerless
by
the
cold
beams
of
morning
than
it
did
before
we
now
threaded
several
tedious
streets
and
at
last
came
to
the
james
river
where
we
halted
in
front
of
a
most
but
very
large
brick
building
situated
on
the
bank
and
surrounded
by
a
formidable
circle
of
guards
this
building
we
very
naturally
took
to
be
a
prison
and
soon
learned
that
we
were
right
it
was
the
famous
libby
we
entered
its
precincts
and
were
conducted
up
a
flight
of
stairs
and
then
on
reaching
the
upper
room
which
was
a
vast
open
one
we
saw
almost
for
the
first
time
since
our
capture
the
old
familiar
united
states
uniform
we
were
soon
in
the
midst
of
over
a
hundred
union
soldiers
at
first
our
greeting
was
not
very
warm
as
we
still
wore
the
rebel
rags
that
had
served
us
all
summer
but
as
soon
as
our
true
character
and
history
were
made
known
we
were
most
cordially
welcomed
there
was
a
small
stove
only
one
in
the
cold
empty
room
and
part
of
the
inmates
were
huddled
around
it
but
with
the
characteristic
courtesy
and
charity
of
the
american
soldier
they
soon
cleared
a
place
beside
it
for
us
then
i
had
leisure
to
look
around
the
room
was
very
large
and
bare
the
floor
above
was
taken
out
leaving
it
open
to
the
roof
beside
this
the
window
sashes
were
all
removed
and
the
cold
wind
whistled
in
from
the
river
far
more
sharply
than
was
consistent
with
comfort
the
inmates
informed
me
that
they
had
only
a
limited
amount
of
fuel
allowed
them
per
day
and
when
that
was
exhausted
they
had
to
endure
the
freezing
as
best
they
could
even
when
the
fire
was
burning
only
about
a
dozen
could
get
around
it
and
the
room
was
too
large
and
open
to
be
warmed
more
than
a
few
feet
from
the
stove
yet
with
all
these
discomforts
we
rejoiced
to
be
here
it
was
the
sure
pledge
that
our
foes
had
not
been
deceiving
us
in
their
promises
of
an
exchange
for
these
men
with
whom
we
found
ourselves
were
actually
going
northward
in
the
next
which
was
daily
expected
our
hearts
beat
high
as
we
thought
that
after
drinking
the
bitter
draught
of
bondage
and
persecution
for
eight
long
months
we
were
at
last
to
taste
the
sweets
of
liberty
what
wonder
if
our
joy
was
too
deep
for
words
and
we
could
only
turn
it
over
in
our
minds
and
tremble
lest
it
should
prove
too
delightful
to
be
realized
what
cared
we
for
the
cold
that
made
our
teeth
chatter
and
sent
the
icy
chill
to
our
very
bones
it
was
only
for
the
moment
and
beyond
that
we
painted
the
bright
vision
of
freedom
with
such
vividness
and
warmth
that
cold
and
privations
were
forgotten
together
but
our
dream
was
short
we
talked
with
our
companions
and
learned
from
them
many
interesting
items
of
news
the
worst
we
heard
and
which
at
first
we
could
hardly
credit
was
the
existence
of
a
large
party
in
the
north
who
were
opposed
to
the
war
because
as
my
informant
said
they
were
afraid
if
the
thing
went
on
they
would
be
drafted
and
would
have
to
fight
themselves
oh
how
bitterly
some
of
the
prisoners
who
were
profanely
inclined
cursed
those
who
could
oppose
their
government
in
such
a
time
as
this
not
many
of
the
soldiers
sympathized
with
these
traitors
they
were
still
hopeful
of
success
and
confident
that
the
time
would
soon
come
when
they
would
crush
rebellion
but
in
the
midst
of
our
conversation
an
officer
entered
and
called
for
the
men
who
had
just
been
admitted
expecting
to
be
paroled
as
all
the
other
prisoners
in
the
room
were
we
at
once
responded
they
conducted
us
down
to
the
entrance
hall
and
called
over
our
names
the
four
prisoners
of
war
and
one
of
the
tennesseeans
were
put
on
one
side
and
we
on
the
other
the
first
party
were
then
taken
up
stairs
again
while
we
were
put
into
an
immense
but
dark
and
low
room
on
the
left
of
the
stairway
this
was
an
awful
moment
we
now
felt
that
we
had
been
deceived
and
our
hopes
at
once
fell
from
the
highest
heaven
to
which
they
had
soared
down
to
perfect
nothingness
and
a
cold
sense
of
misery
and
despair
came
over
us
to
be
thus
separated
from
our
friends
also
seemed
like
parting
the
sheep
from
the
goats
and
could
only
be
for
the
purpose
of
punishment
no
wonder
that
we
looked
at
each
other
with
pale
troubled
countenances
and
asked
questions
which
none
were
prepared
to
solve
but
only
one
moment
were
we
thus
crushed
beneath
this
unexpected
blow
the
next
we
again
sought
an
avenue
for
hope
perhaps
they
did
not
recognize
us
as
soldiers
and
only
wanted
to
exchange
us
as
citizens
a
matter
of
indifference
to
us
provided
we
were
exchanged
at
all
we
looked
around
to
see
what
foundation
there
might
be
for
this
pleasing
conjecture
our
present
apartment
contained
even
more
prisoners
than
the
one
they
were
men
from
all
parts
of
the
south
some
of
them
had
been
in
prison
ever
since
the
war
broke
out
and
a
few
had
been
arrested
for
supposed
principles
even
before
that
event
and
had
lived
in
loathsome
dungeons
ever
since
this
would
be
called
barbarous
tyranny
if
it
occurred
in
italy
but
i
have
seen
men
even
in
my
own
ohio
who
could
see
no
wrong
in
it
when
practiced
in
the
south
on
supposed
there
were
also
some
of
our
own
soldiers
here
who
had
been
put
in
for
attempting
to
escape
this
survey
was
not
calculated
to
increase
our
feeble
hopes
of
a
speedy
exchange
or
even
to
weaken
our
fears
of
further
punishment
in
the
meantime
breakfast
was
brought
in
it
consisted
of
a
small
quantity
of
thin
soup
and
a
very
scanty
allowance
of
bread
to
our
delight
the
latter
was
made
of
flour
instead
of
corn
meal
and
all
the
time
we
remained
in
richmond
we
received
good
bread
though
often
very
deficient
in
quantity
while
we
were
talking
with
our
new
an
officer
again
entered
and
inquired
for
the
fifteen
men
who
had
last
come
in
we
answered
quickly
for
hope
was
again
busy
whispering
in
our
hearts
and
suggesting
that
there
had
been
some
mistake
which
would
now
be
rectified
and
we
taken
up
stairs
again
but
there
was
no
such
good
fortune
in
store
for
us
we
were
taken
out
of
doors
and
there
found
a
guard
waiting
to
remove
us
to
another
prison
again
our
hearts
sank
within
us
we
crossed
the
street
and
halted
at
a
building
which
we
afterward
learned
was
castle
thunder
the
bastile
of
the
south
we
were
conducted
through
a
guarded
door
into
the
where
we
had
to
wait
for
some
time
while
here
a
man
who
i
afterwards
learned
was
chillis
the
commissary
of
the
prison
came
in
and
said
bridge
burners
are
they
they
ought
to
be
hung
every
man
of
them
and
so
ought
every
man
that
does
anything
against
the
confederacy
had
he
said
i
would
have
agreed
with
him
heartily
soon
the
guide
returned
and
ordered
us
to
be
conducted
up
stairs
up
we
went
passing
by
a
room
filled
with
a
howling
and
yelling
multitude
who
made
such
an
outrageous
racket
that
i
was
compelled
to
put
my
hands
to
my
ears
as
we
came
in
view
a
score
of
voices
screamed
with
all
the
energy
their
lungs
could
give
fresh
fish
fresh
fish
the
same
exclamation
greeted
every
new
arrival
we
were
taken
into
the
office
and
searched
to
see
if
we
possessed
anything
contraband
or
in
plainer
terms
anything
they
could
make
useful
to
themselves
they
took
some
nice
pocket
knives
from
the
tennesseeans
which
they
had
contrived
to
keep
secreted
till
now
when
it
came
my
turn
i
managed
to
slip
a
large
knife
that
i
had
obtained
at
atlanta
up
my
sleeve
and
by
carefully
turning
my
arm
when
they
felt
for
concealed
weapons
succeeded
in
keeping
it
out
of
the
way
the
examination
over
i
thought
they
were
going
to
put
us
into
the
miniature
we
had
just
passed
and
they
did
not
do
much
better
for
they
put
us
into
a
stall
beside
it
i
call
it
a
stall
for
the
word
describes
it
most
fully
it
was
one
of
a
range
partitioned
off
from
the
large
room
in
which
were
the
noisy
miscreants
and
from
each
other
by
loose
plank
with
cracks
wide
enough
to
let
the
wind
circulate
freely
through
them
most
of
the
windows
of
the
large
room
were
out
which
greatly
increased
the
cold
our
stall
was
only
eight
or
nine
feet
wide
and
perhaps
sixteen
in
length
it
was
bare
of
any
furniture
not
even
having
a
chair
or
any
means
of
making
a
fire
in
this
cheerless
place
our
party
six
in
number
and
nine
tennesseeans
were
confined
during
the
months
of
december
and
january
the
first
day
of
our
imprisonment
here
our
spirits
sank
lower
than
they
had
ever
done
before
all
our
bright
hopes
were
dashed
to
the
ground
and
there
seemed
every
reason
to
believe
that
we
were
doomed
to
this
dreary
abode
for
the
remaining
term
of
the
war
even
if
we
escaped
sharing
with
our
murdered
friends
the
horrors
of
a
southern
scaffold
it
was
too
disheartening
for
philosophy
and
that
day
was
one
of
the
blackest
gloom
we
seldom
spoke
and
when
we
did
it
was
to
denounce
our
folly
in
suffering
ourselves
to
be
deluded
to
richmond
by
the
lies
they
had
told
and
not
seizing
some
of
the
many
opportunities
our
journey
afforded
for
making
our
escape
but
it
was
no
use
lamenting
and
all
we
could
do
was
to
register
a
solemn
vow
never
to
be
deceived
by
them
again
when
night
came
we
knelt
in
prayer
to
god
and
if
i
ever
prayed
with
fervor
it
was
in
this
hour
of
disappointment
and
dread
i
tried
to
roll
all
my
cares
upon
the
lord
and
partly
succeeded
rising
from
my
knees
comforted
and
assured
that
whatever
might
be
the
issue
we
had
one
friend
who
was
nigh
to
save
and
had
often
made
his
children
rejoice
in
worse
situations
than
ours
the
next
morning
i
awoke
again
cheerful
and
felt
nerved
for
any
fate
that
might
befall
me
here
the
routine
of
prison
life
did
not
differ
materially
from
that
at
atlanta
we
had
to
go
down
to
the
court
the
building
was
square
and
built
with
an
open
court
in
the
center
to
wash
in
the
morning
and
were
immediately
taken
back
to
our
stall
and
locked
up
but
the
principal
difference
was
our
want
of
fire
this
made
it
our
greatest
difficulty
to
keep
warm
and
effectually
destroyed
all
those
pleasant
fireside
chats
that
had
done
so
much
to
make
our
condition
endurable
in
the
atlanta
barracks
as
the
darkness
and
coldness
of
night
drew
on
we
were
compelled
to
pace
the
floor
trying
to
keep
warm
and
when
sleep
became
a
necessity
we
would
all
pile
down
in
a
huddle
as
pigs
sometimes
do
and
spread
over
us
the
thin
protection
of
our
two
bits
of
carpet
thus
we
would
lie
until
too
cold
to
remain
longer
and
then
arise
and
resume
our
walk
we
had
always
plenty
of
light
except
when
the
awkwardness
of
the
gas
managers
left
the
whole
city
in
darkness
which
was
frequently
the
case
we
never
omitted
our
devotions
for
awhile
the
deserters
outside
who
were
composed
of
the
very
scum
of
southern
society
many
of
them
being
the
rowdies
gamblers
and
cutthroats
of
the
large
cities
tried
to
interrupt
us
by
every
means
in
their
power
but
finding
that
their
efforts
produced
no
effect
they
finally
gave
over
and
left
us
to
pursue
our
own
way
in
peace
we
found
afterward
when
for
a
short
time
we
were
put
among
them
that
they
respected
us
the
more
for
it
thus
it
will
always
be
when
perseverance
is
exercised
in
a
good
cause
a
few
days
after
our
arrival
we
noticed
a
great
stir
among
the
prisoners
at
the
libby
which
was
plainly
in
view
across
the
road
and
but
a
short
distance
from
us
we
learned
that
a
had
arrived
soon
a
body
of
united
states
soldiers
came
up
the
street
by
us
and
our
five
friends
with
them
as
they
passed
our
window
they
waved
their
hands
in
farewell
and
continued
their
journey
no
doubt
they
were
soon
with
their
friends
at
home
the
parting
was
a
hard
one
for
us
it
seemed
so
much
like
fulfilling
the
passage
of
scripture
one
shall
be
taken
and
the
other
left
that
we
turned
away
from
the
window
feeling
again
the
gloom
which
darkened
the
first
day
of
our
arrival
we
felt
utterly
deserted
and
alone
yet
we
were
glad
that
some
had
been
able
to
escape
from
the
power
of
this
accursed
rebellion
every
throb
of
whose
life
is
a
crime
against
the
very
race
to
which
we
belong
a
letter
was
received
from
one
of
them
by
my
father
a
short
time
ago
he
had
not
heard
of
our
release
but
described
our
parting
and
gave
a
rumor
which
he
had
heard
of
our
subsequent
execution
in
the
dead
sameness
which
now
settled
down
again
over
our
we
had
a
delightful
daily
oasis
in
reading
the
newspapers
in
richmond
we
were
not
as
elsewhere
debarred
their
perusal
and
there
was
always
some
one
who
had
money
enough
to
buy
them
and
then
charity
enough
to
lend
them
all
over
the
prison
in
this
way
we
were
enabled
to
see
most
of
the
dailies
published
as
soon
as
we
received
one
all
the
party
would
gather
around
while
i
read
the
news
and
editorials
aloud
the
time
of
our
arrival
was
an
exciting
one
burnside
had
just
made
his
celebrated
advance
and
as
we
read
of
his
crossing
the
river
we
breathed
a
prayer
that
he
would
be
successful
and
continue
onward
to
richmond
had
he
done
so
we
would
either
have
fallen
into
his
hands
or
been
removed
in
the
latter
case
we
would
have
made
a
desperate
effort
to
escape
for
we
had
firmly
resolved
never
to
be
moved
again
without
making
a
strike
for
freedom
but
soon
came
the
sad
news
of
his
repulse
sad
to
us
but
causing
the
greatest
rejoicings
among
the
rebels
who
felt
that
they
had
escaped
a
great
danger
and
renewed
the
life
of
their
tottering
treason
we
missed
the
books
we
were
no
longer
able
to
borrow
and
planned
all
kinds
of
means
to
obtain
them
among
other
expedients
i
managed
to
sell
my
hat
it
was
a
fine
one
and
had
formerly
belonged
to
jack
wells
but
one
day
when
he
was
drunk
enough
to
be
in
a
clever
humor
he
took
mine
which
was
a
very
poor
one
from
me
and
put
his
own
on
my
head
saying
that
i
looked
better
in
that
no
doubt
he
intended
to
trade
back
but
forgot
it
when
we
started
away
and
so
left
me
in
possession
i
sold
this
hat
for
three
dollars
and
a
half
and
bought
another
extremely
poor
one
for
half
a
dollar
leaving
me
three
dollars
of
available
funds
which
added
to
five
more
afterward
obtained
from
a
union
man
made
quite
a
fortune
with
this
i
tried
to
procure
a
book
i
wanted
i
gave
the
money
to
the
corporal
who
attended
the
prison
but
he
kept
it
several
days
and
then
returned
it
to
me
i
next
tried
one
of
the
officers
of
the
prison
but
met
with
no
better
success
determined
not
to
be
baffled
i
dropped
the
money
through
a
crack
in
the
floor
to
a
lady
prisoner
below
who
was
allowed
to
go
out
in
town
but
in
a
few
days
she
too
sent
it
back
saying
that
the
book
was
not
in
richmond
still
persevering
i
wrote
the
names
of
several
books
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
gave
it
to
chillis
the
commissary
who
wanted
us
hung
when
we
first
came
but
who
was
nevertheless
the
kindest
official
of
the
prison
he
likewise
returned
it
saying
that
of
the
books
named
were
to
be
found
i
then
yielded
and
reserved
my
money
for
the
next
best
purpose
to
which
it
could
be
applied
to
buy
bread
which
i
often
needed
we
could
at
first
get
small
cakes
for
ten
cents
apiece
but
they
afterward
rose
to
fifteen
we
had
to
take
postage
stamps
in
change
and
having
no
to
carry
them
in
they
would
often
become
torn
and
cracked
which
rendered
them
worthless
thus
we
lost
a
considerable
portion
of
our
precious
money
we
soon
became
very
restless
and
discontented
here
and
revolved
desperate
plans
of
escape
it
seemed
like
a
hopeless
prospect
for
we
were
in
the
third
story
and
could
only
escape
by
passing
at
each
door
through
successive
relays
of
guards
all
of
which
had
a
reserve
ready
to
coöperate
with
them
in
case
of
alarm
our
room
was
next
to
the
jailor
office
and
on
the
opposite
side
was
a
row
of
rooms
containing
all
kinds
of
prisoners
the
one
next
to
us
was
occupied
by
a
number
of
federal
soldiers
some
charged
with
being
spies
and
others
with
murder
one
of
the
latter
was
captain
webster
he
was
a
young
and
most
handsome
man
not
over
years
of
age
he
had
on
one
occasion
been
sent
to
take
a
notorious
guerilla
captain
named
simpson
who
was
then
hiding
within
our
lines
when
he
was
found
webster
summoned
him
to
surrender
instead
of
doing
so
he
fired
his
pistol
and
started
to
run
but
webster
also
fired
and
mortally
wounded
him
when
webster
was
subsequently
taken
prisoner
he
was
held
for
the
of
simpson
and
confined
in
the
room
next
to
us
the
charge
i
have
repeatedly
heard
not
only
from
himself
and
fellow
prisoners
but
from
the
officers
of
the
prison
judge
of
my
surprise
then
on
reading
since
my
return
home
of
the
hanging
of
webster
for
his
this
being
a
charge
that
the
law
of
war
would
visit
with
death
the
confederates
in
substituting
the
one
charge
for
the
other
in
order
to
justify
themselves
and
prevent
retaliation
webster
too
was
tired
of
confinement
and
ready
to
risk
all
in
a
bold
strike
for
freedom
the
decision
was
soon
made
and
christmas
evening
was
the
time
fixed
for
the
attempt
there
were
a
number
of
citizens
in
the
room
below
who
were
in
a
more
favorable
situation
for
initiating
the
movement
than
we
were
we
had
opened
telegraphic
communication
as
we
had
done
before
at
atlanta
and
after
full
consultation
it
was
agreed
to
let
these
citizens
give
the
signal
this
was
to
be
the
cry
of
fire
and
when
it
was
heard
we
were
all
to
rush
upon
the
guards
and
overpower
them
there
were
only
about
thirty
guards
in
the
building
and
we
had
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
men
concerned
in
the
plot
we
were
therefore
sure
of
success
if
every
one
performed
his
part
at
least
in
getting
out
of
the
building
which
was
a
less
difficult
task
than
leaving
the
city
on
christmas
eve
everything
was
in
readiness
with
us
and
most
anxiously
did
we
wait
for
the
signal
the
hours
rolled
slowly
on
and
midnight
passed
but
no
signal
was
given
we
afterward
learned
that
the
citizens
below
failed
in
courage
when
the
decisive
moment
came
and
thus
defeated
a
plan
which
would
in
all
probability
have
been
successful
and
would
have
startled
rebeldom
no
little
in
thus
bursting
open
their
strongest
prison
the
next
night
we
resolved
to
try
once
more
and
that
no
might
now
interfere
we
appointed
webster
our
leader
knowing
that
he
would
not
falter
again
we
prepared
the
locks
of
all
the
rooms
were
drawn
except
our
own
which
was
so
close
to
the
guard
that
it
could
not
be
taken
off
without
great
danger
of
discovery
some
did
not
want
to
go
but
were
very
kind
to
those
of
us
who
did
supplying
us
with
serviceable
shoes
and
taking
our
ones
in
return
at
last
everything
being
in
readiness
we
again
waited
for
the
signal
those
in
our
room
were
to
remain
quiet
till
it
was
given
and
then
burst
off
the
door
which
was
a
light
one
and
rush
on
the
guard
we
took
a
board
that
supported
the
and
four
of
us
holding
it
as
a
did
not
doubt
our
ability
to
dash
the
door
into
the
middle
of
the
large
room
and
seize
the
guard
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
as
to
the
nature
of
the
assault
the
other
small
rooms
were
soon
vacated
the
movement
being
concealed
from
the
observation
of
the
guard
by
the
inmates
of
the
large
room
into
which
all
the
others
opened
standing
up
around
the
doors
for
an
instant
all
was
silence
we
lifted
up
our
hearts
in
prayer
to
god
that
he
would
be
with
us
and
preserve
us
through
the
coming
strife
and
if
consistent
with
his
high
will
permit
us
to
regain
our
liberty
what
can
cause
the
delay
minute
after
minute
passes
and
the
dead
silence
is
only
broken
by
the
throbbing
of
our
own
hearts
we
stand
with
the
board
ready
and
our
spirits
eager
for
the
coming
contest
which
shall
lead
us
to
grapple
with
naked
arms
the
shining
bayonets
of
the
guards
we
do
not
doubt
the
issue
for
the
hope
of
liberty
inspires
us
but
now
we
see
our
friends
creeping
to
their
we
grind
our
teeth
with
rage
and
chagrin
but
soon
hear
the
explanation
which
makes
us
think
that
the
lord
is
indeed
watching
over
us
just
as
our
leader
was
ready
to
give
the
signal
a
friend
pressed
to
his
side
and
informed
him
that
we
were
betrayed
and
that
an
extra
guard
of
over
eighty
men
was
drawn
up
in
line
before
the
door
with
orders
to
shoot
down
every
one
that
issued
from
it
while
still
another
detachment
was
ready
to
close
in
behind
and
make
an
indiscriminate
massacre
had
we
attempted
to
carry
out
our
plan
the
guard
would
have
yielded
before
us
until
we
were
drawn
into
the
trap
and
then
they
hoped
to
make
such
a
slaughter
as
would
be
a
perpetual
warning
to
when
i
first
heard
this
story
i
thought
it
the
invention
of
some
individual
who
feared
the
trial
and
the
danger
of
our
scheme
but
it
was
true
the
next
day
the
richmond
papers
contained
a
full
of
the
whole
affair
and
captain
alexander
the
tyrant
who
commanded
the
prison
threatened
to
have
every
one
engaged
in
it
tied
up
and
whipped
but
he
finally
concluded
not
to
do
so
and
the
excitement
passed

to

that
we
were
still
alive
but
hitherto
had
failed
now
we
had
a
providential
opportunity
some
of
the
prisoners
who
were
captured
at
the
battle
of
murfreesboro
were
brought
to
richmond
and
confined
in
the
basement
of
our
building
while
they
remained
i
wrote
a
note
with
a
pencil
on
the
of
a
book
and
when
taken
down
to
wash
in
the
morning
slipped
around
to
the
door
of
the
western
prisoners
and
gave
it
to
an
irishman
he
concealed
it
until
he
was
exchanged
and
then
mailed
it
to
my
father
it
produced
a
great
sensation
among
my
friends
most
of
whom
had
long
since
given
me
up
for
dead
it
was
the
first
that
had
been
heard
of
our
party
since
the
atlanta
escape
and
was
at
once
published
in
my
county
paper
and
copied
in
many
others
the
following
is
the
note
richmond
january
dear
father
i
take
the
opportunity
of
writing
by
a
paroled
prisoner
to
let
you
know
that
i
am
well
and
doing
as
well
as
could
be
expected
under
the
circumstances
i
have
seen
some
rather
hard
times
but
the
worst
is
past
our
lives
are
now
safe
but
we
will
be
kept
during
the
war
unless
something
lucky
turns
up
for
us
there
are
six
of
our
original
railroad
party
here
yet
seven
were
executed
in
june
and
eight
escaped
in
october
i
stand
the
imprisonment
pretty
well
the
worst
of
it
is
to
hear
of
our
men
getting
whipped
so
often
i
hear
all
the
news
here
read
three
or
four
papers
a
day
i
even
know
that
bingham
was
beat
in
the
last
election
for
which
i
am
very
sorry
the
price
of
everything
here
is
awful
it
costs
thirty
cents
to
send
a
letter
this
will
account
for
my
not
writing
to
all
my
friends
give
my
sincere
love
to
them
and
tell
them
to
write
to
me
you
may
write
by
leaving
the
letter
unsealed
putting
in
nothing
that
will
offend
the
secesh
and
directing
to
castle
thunder
richmond
virginia
i
want
to
know
the
private
news
how
many
of
my
friends
have
fallen
also
tell
who
has
been
drafted
in
our
neighborhood
who
married
and
who
like
to
be
also
if
you
have
a
gold
dollar
at
hand
slip
it
into
the
letter
not
more
as
it
might
tempt
the
secesh
to
it
i
have
tried
to
send
word
through
to
you
several
times
before
but
there
is
now
a
better
chance
of
communicating
since
we
came
from
atlanta
to
richmond
mother
here
referring
to
religious
experience
no
doubt
you
all
would
like
to
see
me
again
but
let
us
have
patience
many
a
better
man
than
i
am
has
suffered
more
and
many
parents
are
mourning
for
their
children
without
the
hope
of
seeing
them
again
so
keep
your
courage
up
and
do
not
be
uneasy
about
me
write
as
soon
as
you
can
and
tell
all
my
friends
to
do
the
same
ever
yours

new
somerset
jefferson
county
ohio
we
remained
in
this
prison
reading
of
the
victories
of
southern
rebels
and
the
doings
of
northern
traitors
until
the
first
of
february
at
that
time
they
wanted
our
range
of
rooms
for
a
hospital
this
range
was
not
adapted
to
the
purpose
but
was
at
least
as
good
as
the
garret
above
where
all
who
went
were
sure
of
death
disease
was
now
making
fearful
havoc
the
prevailed
to
a
frightful
extent
and
the
whole
town
was
alarmed
men
were
dying
around
us
every
day
none
of
our
party
was
infected
but
many
of
the
tennesseeans
were
it
was
no
wonder
that
they
found
it
necessary
to
extend
their
hospitals
for
the
treatment
we
received
was
well
calculated
to
make
the
hardiest
men
sink
beneath
their
trials
but
these
fearful
ravages
of
pestilence
did
at
least
the
good
of
securing
our
removal
from
the
pen
in
which
we
had
been
confined
at
first
we
were
taken
to
the
bedlam
i
have
described
before
and
even
this
was
better
than
the
loneliness
and
of
our
strict
confinement
it
seemed
like
freedom
by
contrast
we
now
had
a
fire
also
a
luxury
which
one
who
has
been
for
two
months
knows
well
how
to
appreciate
it
is
true
it
did
not
warm
half
the
people
around
it
and
these
had
not
the
courtesy
of
our
brethern
in
the
libby
yet
it
was
a
great
thing
to
be
occasionally
warm
the
amusements
of
our
new
friends
were
striking
if
not
elegant
when
a
dense
crowd
would
gather
round
the
fire
some
mischievous
irishman
would
cry
out
me
boys
and
with
his
confederates
rush
against
the
mass
knocking
men
in
all
directions
upsetting
pots
skinning
elbows
and
spoiling
tempers
generally
fights
were
of
frequent
occurrence
and
it
only
needed
the
addition
of
intoxicating
liquor
to
constitute
a
perfect
pandemonium
the
evenings
were
a
compensation
after
the
turmoil
of
the
day
was
over
and
most
of
those
who
had
blankets
had
retired
to
rest
a
party
of
the
worst
rowdies
who
had
been
annoying
us
all
day
would
gather
around
the
stove
and
appear
in
a
new
character
that
of
i
have
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
night
in
listening
to
them
and
have
heard
some
of
the
finest
fairy
tales
and
most
romantic
legends
but
the
approach
of
day
put
an
end
to
all
the
romantic
disposition
of
my
companions
and
left
them
ill
ruffians
as
before
we
soon
wearied
of
this
perpetual
ferment
and
petitioned
to
be
put
below
in
the
room
with
the
union
men
after
some
delay
it
was
granted
and
then
came
a
more
pleasant
part
of
my
prison
life
the
room
was
large
but
dark
and
the
windows
not
only
secured
by
crossing
bars
but
woven
over
with
wires
the
refuse
of
the
manufactory
had
been
thrown
in
this
room
till
they
covered
the
floor
to
a
depth
of
several
inches
but
to
compensate
for
these
disagreeable
accompaniments
of
our
new
apartment
it
had
a
stove
and
was
warm
so
that
the
terrible
suffering
with
the
cold
which
none
can
appreciate
but
those
who
have
endured
was
now
at
an
end
there
was
also
good
society
here
nearly
a
hundred
union
men
from
different
parts
of
the
south
all
intensely
patriotic
and
many
of
them
possessing
great
intelligence
in
talking
with
these
men
and
hearing
their
adventures
and
opinions
i
passed
many
a
pleasant
hour
and
gained
a
great
insight
into
the
views
of
southern
unionists
one
of
these
who
became
an
intimate
friend
was
a
scotchman
named
miller
when
the
war
commenced
he
was
residing
in
texas
and
witnessed
the
manner
in
which
that
state
was
precipitated
into
secession
the
first
part
of
the
plan
was
to
excite
rumors
of
a
contemplated
slave
insurrection
then
the
conspirators
would
place
poison
and
weapons
in
certain
localities
and
find
them
as
if
by
accident
this
was
continued
till
the
public
mind
was
in
a
perfect
ferment
the
next
step
was
to
take
some
slaves
and
whip
them
until
the
torture
made
them
confess
their
own
guilt
and
also
implicate
the
leading
opponents
of
secession
this
was
enough
the
slaves
and
unionists
were
hung
together
on
the
nearest
tree
and
all
opposition
to
the
nefarious
schemes
brutally
crushed
thus
has
slavery
furnished
the
means
of
paving
the
way
to
treason
miller
himself
was
taken
and
after
narrowly
escaping
the
fate
of
his
friends
was
sent
eastward
to
be
tried
as
a
traitor
he
twice
made
his
escape
once
traveling
over
two
hundred
miles
and
each
time
when
captured
telling
a
different
story
finally
he
represented
himself
as
a
citizen
from
new
york
when
brought
before
judge
baxter
the
magistrate
of
castle
thunder
for
examination
he
merely
said
i
told
you
all
about
my
case
before
the
judge
who
was
considerably
intoxicated
thought
that
he
had
actually
been
examined
before
and
dismissed
him
without
further
questioning
he
was
brought
up
several
times
after
that
but
always
gave
them
the
same
answer
thus
keeping
them
completely
deceived
and
was
at
length
exchanged
i
here
became
acquainted
with
a
young
man
of
the
potomac
army
whom
i
shall
call
charlie
he
was
employed
to
go
near
richmond
to
fire
a
bridge
and
collect
important
information
while
executing
his
perilous
mission
he
was
captured
with
papers
in
his
possession
fully
proving
his
character
as
a
spy
and
was
despatched
with
a
sergeant
as
escort
toward
richmond
while
on
the
way
the
sergeant
who
was
fond
of
liquor
got
a
chance
to
indulge
and
became
very
careless
charlie
watching
his
opportunity
slipped
from
the
breast
pocket
of
his
guard
the
packet
of
papers
containing
his
charges
with
the
directions
for
his
disposal
and
threw
them
into
a
pond
by
the
wayside
when
he
arrived
at
richmond
the
authorities
did
not
know
his
character
and
put
him
into
the
large
room
with
the
other
prisoners
instead
of
confining
him
separately
when
the
evidence
against
him
arrived
the
commanding
officer
entered
with
a
guard
and
inquired
for
him
now
was
his
last
chance
for
life
and
well
was
it
improved
it
so
happened
that
a
man
had
died
in
the
prison
the
night
before
and
charlie
at
once
responded
o
that
fellow
died
last
night
and
pointed
to
the
corpse
died
has
he
the
rascal
we
hung
him
this
week
and
saved
him
the
trouble
if
he
only
held
on
growled
the
officer
and
departed
charlie
was
shortly
after
exchanged
under
the
man
just
when
the
discouragement
of
all
lovers
of
their
country
was
the
greatest
resulting
from
the
news
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
peace
party
in
the
north
a
tennessee
congressman
visited
our
prison
he
gathered
the
tennesseeans
around
him
and
urged
them
to
return
to
their
allegiance
stating
that
the
union
cause
was
now
hopeless
as
it
was
abandoned
even
by
the
northern
states
which
were
in
the
hands
of
the
democrats
who
would
make
peace
on
any
terms
closing
by
asking
them
now
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
confederacy
and
go
into
its
army
promising
that
all
their
previous
obstinacy
should
be
forgiven
the
effect
was
wonderful
listen
ye
who
cavil
at
the
government
and
while
opposing
its
policy
still
think
you
do
no
harm
these
were
loyal
men
and
had
proved
it
by
abandoning
all
for
the
cherished
cause
many
of
them
spending
weary
months
in
loathsome
dungeons
yet
on
hearing
of
the
triumph
of
this
faction
which
promises
to
restore
the
union
by
conciliating
and
wooing
back
the
rebels
over
of
them
yielded
and
gave
that
consent
which
neither
danger
nor
suffering
had
been
able
to
force
from
them
thus
were
over
twenty
recruits
from
one
room
of
one
prison
obtained
for
the
rebel
army
by
the
triumphs
of
northern
democracy
a
part
remained
faithful
and
this
excited
the
ire
of
the
secessionists
to
punish
them
captain
alexander
issued
an
order
that
all
the
menial
service
of
the
prison
should
be
performed
by
union
men
some
obeyed
the
order
while
others
would
not
but
those
who
did
the
work
complained
that
unwilling
ones
were
not
made
to
help
them
to
remedy
this
a
list
was
prepared
and
the
names
taken
in
order
one
of
the
first
called
was
a
tennesseean
named
mccoy
he
answered
boldly
i
not
going
what
the
matter
now
demanded
the
sergeant
i
did
come
here
to
work
and
if
you
ca
board
me
without
you
may
send
me
home
replied
the
fearless
man
well
well
you
be
attended
to
growled
the
sergeant
and
proceeded
with
the
roll
four
others
likewise
refused
and
were
reported
to
captain
alexander
who
at
once
ordered
them
to
be
put
into
the
cell
this
was
a
dark
place
beside
the
open
court
and
only
about
four
feet
wide
by
six
or
seven
in
length
it
had
no
floor
but
the
damp
earth
and
was
destitute
of
light
here
they
were
informed
that
they
should
remain
until
they
agreed
to
work
we
found
another
alternative
for
there
was
a
piece
of
file
and
a
scrap
of
in
our
room
which
we
took
and
buying
a
candle
from
the
commissary
watched
our
opportunity
when
taken
out
to
wash
to
slip
them
into
the
cell
as
soon
as
these
necessaries
were
received
the
boys
begun
faithfully
to
dig
their
way
out
under
the
wall
all
day
and
night
they
worked
but
did
not
get
through
the
next
day
we
supplied
them
with
another
candle
and
they
labored
on
toward
morning
they
broke
upward
through
the
crust
of
the
ground
outside
the
foremost
one
wormed
his
way
out
and
glided
off
he
was
never
heard
from
and
no
doubt
reached
the
union
lines
the
next
man
was
just
under
the
wall
when
the
barking
of
a
dog
that
happened
to
be
prowling
around
drew
the
attention
of
the
guard
that
way
and
prevented
his
escape
but
though
the
stampede
was
thus
arrested
it
was
a
lesson
that
prevented
the
confinement
of
any
more
in
the
cell
yet
they
were
not
content
to
give
up
the
idea
of
making
us
their
servants
i
happened
to
be
on
the
next
list
prepared
this
time
the
task
was
to
dig
in
captain
alexander
garden
which
we
would
have
been
obliged
to
perform
with
an
armed
guard
standing
over
us
of
course
we
refused
to
go
as
a
punishment
we
were
ordered
into
the
yard
which
was
only
a
vacant
corner
of
the
building
enclosed
by
high
brick
walls
on
the
top
of
which
guards
walked
it
was
a
cold
day
in
february
and
was
raining
we
were
nearly
naked
having
only
the
remnant
of
the
rags
that
had
already
served
for
more
than
their
time
the
bottoms
were
out
of
my
shoes
and
the
water
stood
in
the
yard
several
inches
deep
the
cold
wet
wind
swept
down
with
biting
sharpness
and
almost
robbed
us
of
sensation
we
paced
the
narrow
bounds
through
the
mud
and
water
until
too
weary
to
walk
any
more
and
then
resigned
ourselves
to
our
misery
here
we
remained
from
early
in
the
morning
till
in
the
evening
they
told
us
we
would
have
to
stay
there
till
we
agreed
to
work
or
froze
to
death
the
first
we
resolved
never
to
do
the
latter
was
prevented
by
relief
from
an
unexpected
source
the
old
commissary
who
had
been
so
harsh
to
us
when
we
first
arrived
now
went
to
captain
alexander
and
remonstrated
with
him
for
his
cruelty
said
he
if
you
want
to
kill
the
men
and
i
know
the
rascals
deserve
it
do
it
at
once
hanging
is
the
best
way
but
do
keep
them
there
to
die
by
inches
for
it
will
disgrace
us
all
over
the
world
this
logic
produced
a
good
effect
and
the
order
was
given
to
send
us
back
to
our
room
which
with
its
warm
fire
never
seemed
more
pleasant
it
was
well
they
did
not
keep
us
out
during
the
night
for
we
had
determined
to
scale
the
wall
if
we
lost
half
of
our
number
in
the
attempt
the
effects
of
that
terrible
day
of
freezing
were
soon
visible
on
entering
the
room
the
grateful
warmth
produced
a
stupor
from
which
most
of
us
awoke
sick
some
died
i
myself
contracted
a
disease
of
the
lungs
which
rendered
me
an
invalid
for
months
after
regaining
my
freedom
one
day
we
were
ordered
into
line
and
the
names
of
all
our
railroad
party
with
a
few
of
the
others
called
over
one
whose
name
was
omitted
asked
the
reason
of
the
omission
the
officer
answered
we
ca
tell
for
this
list
came
from
yankee
land
the
mention
of
yankee
land
started
conjectures
afloat
thick
and
fast
why
should
a
list
be
sent
from
the
north
could
it
be
for
the
purpose
of
exchange
the
whole
prison
was
in
a
ferment
they
soon
discovered
that
a
general
exchange
of
political
prisoners
was
in
contemplation
this
added
fuel
to
the
flames
but
as
the
went
off
one
after
another
and
week
after
week
passed
by
leaving
us
still
in
our
dark
and
wearisome
prison
hope
again
died
away
every
person
who
ventured
to
speak
of
exchange
was
laughed
into
silence
one
day
an
officer
came
into
the
room
and
ordered
a
sergeant
to
take
the
name
of
every
man
who
claimed
united
states
protection
in
order
to
obtain
clothes
for
him
soon
the
clothing
came
it
did
not
comprise
a
complete
suit
but
was
extremely
welcome
never
did
i
see
a
peacock
strut
with
more
ostentation
than
did
some
of
the
prisoners
on
donning
the
uniform
and
it
was
worthy
of
pride
it
was
a
token
that
we
were
not
forsaken
but
that
a
great
nation
was
extending
its
protection
over
us
the
ragged
guards
around
clad
in
their
miserable
butternut
suits
growled
many
uncomplimentary
allusions
to
the
penuriousness
of
their
own
government
in
contrast
with
the
munificence
of
ours
there
were
only
about
one
hundred
of
suits
distributed
though
the
papers
the
next
day
stated
the
number
at
hundred
and
this
i
afterward
found
was
actually
the
number
sent
from
washington
the
entire
four
hundred
and
part
of
the
last
hundred
was
kept
by
the
officers
as
a
compensation
for
their
trouble
in
distributing
them
but
they
certainly
acted
with
more
than
their
ordinary
honesty
in
giving
us
any
at
all
on
the
evening
of
the
of
march
when
we
were
sitting
around
the
fire
lazily
but
not
indifferently
discussing
the
siege
of
vicksburg
and
laying
many
infallible
plans
by
which
it
might
be
at
once
reduced
an
officer
entered
and
gave
the
strange
order
for
all
who
wanted
to
go
to
the
to
come
to
the
office
when
i
obeyed
it
was
with
very
little
hope
that
there
was
really
a
chance
once
more
to
stand
beneath
the
folds
of
our
loved
banner
even
when
part
of
our
had
gone
in
and
signed
the
oath
of
parole
i
feared
that
the
good
news
was
for
them
to
test
the
matter
i
went
forward
and
as
i
gave
my
name
fully
expected
to
hear
the
ca
go
but
no
objection
was
made
for
a
moment
a
delicious
hope
thrilled
through
my
veins
a
vision
of
happiness
and
home
dazzling
as
a
flash
of
summer
lightning
shone
before
my
eyes
but
it
instantly
faded
before
the
remembrance
of
our
atlanta
deception
it
was
announced
that
we
were
to
start
at
four
the
next
morning
the
evening
as
might
be
expected
was
one
of
wild
excitement
nearly
all
acted
like
men
bereft
of
reason
their
joyousness
found
vent
in
vociferous
cheers
in
dancing
and
bounding
over
the
floor
in
embracing
each
other
and
pledging
kind
remembrances
but
there
were
a
few
who
were
not
permitted
to
go
and
i
pitied
them
i
remembered
when
we
had
been
left
by
our
comrades
on
our
first
arrival
in
richmond
and
my
heart
bled
for
these
forsaken
ones
as
they
sat
cheerless
and
alone
seeming
to
feel
even
more
wretched
than
ever
amid
the
general
joy
it
was
near
midnight
before
we
became
calm
enough
to
offer
up
our
usual
evening
devotions
but
when
all
were
at
length
still
wearied
out
by
the
very
excess
of
joy
and
when
the
quietness
that
ever
follows
overwhelming
emotions
had
settled
down
upon
us
we
knelt
in
prayer
a
prayer
of
deep
strong
fervent
thankfulness
and
we
implored
that
we
might
not
be
deceived
in
our
bright
and
vivid
hopes
and
dashed
back
from
our
anticipated
paradise
yet
if
such
should
be
his
high
and
mysterious
will
and
we
should
see
these
hopes
fade
as
others
faded
before
them
we
asked
for
strength
to
bear
the
trial
thus
composed
we
laid
down
to
sleep
and
await
the
event
few
eyes
closed
during
the
entire
night
fancy
was
too
busy
peopling
her
fairy
landscapes
picturing
the
groups
that
awaited
us
beyond
that
boundary
which
for
nearly
a
year
frowned
before
us
gloomy
and
impassable
as
the
silent
river
of
death
but
even
as
we
muse
what
unbidden
fears
spring
up
to
darken
the
prospect
and
stain
the
brightness
of
our
joy
how
many
of
those
friends
whose
love
was
as
our
life
may
be
no
more
for
a
year
not
a
whisper
had
been
heard
and
we
trembled
as
we
thought
of
the
ravages
of
time
and
of
battle
these
and
other
thoughts
whirled
through
our
throbbing
brains
during
that
night
and
were
only
broken
by
the
summons
of
the
commanding
officer
who
long
ere
morning
light
gave
the
thrilling
order
to
for
our
hurriedly
we
thronged
to
our
feet
it
was
true
freedom
once
more
our
terrible
captivity
was
passed
o
joy
joy
almost
too
wild
and
delirious
for
earth
there
was
a
hurrying
around
in
the
darkness
illumined
by
the
flashing
of
a
discordant
calling
of
names
a
careful
inspection
to
see
that
none
went
but
those
allowed
then
forming
two
lines
in
the
courtyard
and
with
bounding
hearts
we
passed
through
the
dreaded
portals
of
castle
thunder
the
same
portals
we
had
passed
more
than
three
months
before
passed
out
into
the
cool
but
night
air
we
next
marched
through
the
muddy
unlighted
streets
for
many
squares
there
were
with
us
a
number
of
sick
who
were
not
willing
to
be
left
behind
and
as
the
rebels
refused
to
provide
conveyances
we
helped
them
encircling
them
in
our
arms
and
supporting
their
tottering
steps
during
the
weary
distance
some
had
to
be
carried
altogether
but
the
burden
was
light
upborne
as
we
were
on
the
wings
of
hope
and
exultation
after
we
were
seated
in
the
cars
we
found
in
some
richmond
papers
the
intelligence
that
a
large
number
of
murderers
robbers
and
traitors
will
leave
this
morning
for
the
united
states
also
congratulating
themselves
on
the
riddance
our
congratulations
were
not
less
fervid
we
glided
slowly
along
passing
fortifications
and
till
we
arrived
at
petersburg
then
onward
to
city
point
the
place
of
general
exchange
here
for
the
first
time
in
eleven
months
we
saw
the
flag
of
the
free
floating
in
proud
beauty
from
the
state
of
maine
it
was
a
glad
sight
her
undulating
stars
were
fairer
to
us
than
the
brightest
constellations
that
ever
sparkled
in
the
azure
fields
above
the
grossest
frauds
are
often
practised
by
the
unscrupulous
secessionists
in
these
exchanges
i
will
give
a
case
that
occurred
at
this
time
a
rebel
soldier
was
wounded
in
the
head
at
the
first
battle
of
manassas
it
affected
his
brain
and
disordered
his
intellect
so
that
even
after
he
had
recovered
physically
he
was
mentally
unable
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
soldier
he
was
confined
a
short
time
in
castle
thunder
and
then
sent
to
camp
lee
to
try
him
again
but
he
was
no
better
than
before
and
they
gave
up
the
attempt
in
despair
then
they
exchanged
him
to
us
and
got
a
in
his
place
when
the
boat
rounded
out
from
the
shore
on
its
homeward
way
our
joy
knew
no
bounds
it
seemed
as
if
we
had
awakened
from
a
hideous
nightmare
dream
to
find
that
all
its
shapes
of
horror
and
grinning
fiends
had
passed
away
and
left
us
standing
in
the
free
sunlight
once
more
our
hearts
beat
glad
music
to
the
thresh
of
the
wheels
on
the
water
knowing
that
each
ponderous
stroke
was
placing
a
greater
distance
between
us
and
our
hated
enemies
then
too
the
happy
welcome
with
which
we
were
greeted
and
the
good
cheer
so
different
from
our
miserable
prison
fare
and
the
kind
faces
smiling
all
around
showed
in
living
colors
that
we
were
freemen
again
down
the
river
we
went
passing
the
historic
ground
of
the
james
as
in
a
delirious
dream
of
rapture
we
were
scarcely
conscious
of
passing
events
no
emotion
on
earth
has
the
same
sweep
and
intensity
as
the
wild
throbbing
sensations
that
rush
thick
and
fast
through
the
bosom
of
the
liberated
captive
on
we
went
reached
the
gunboats
that
ply
up
and
down
the
river
like
giant
sentinels
guarding
the
avenue
to
rebellion
reached
the
mouth
passed
onward
up
the
bay
to
washington
as
we
came
in
sight
we
thronged
tumultuously
to
the
vessel
side
and
bent
eager
loving
eyes
on
the
snowy
marble
front
and
white
towering
steeple
of
our
nation
capitol
on
our
arrival
we
were
requested
by
the
secretary
of
war
to
give
our
depositions
before
hon
joseph
holt
judge
advocate
general
that
the
world
at
large
might
know
on
the
surest
foundation
the
truth
of
our
narrative
we
were
received
by
the
judge
himself
and
hitchcock
who
was
present
with
the
most
marked
cordiality
this
interview
was
merely
a
friendly
one
and
was
passed
in
familiar
conversation
on
our
second
visit
we
found
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
waiting
to
administer
the
necessary
oath
and
also
a
phonographer
to
write
our
testimony
we
were
examined
separately
and
the
result
published
officially
in
the
and
naval
and
also
in
most
of
the
newspapers
of
the
day
we
then
called
on
the
secretary
of
war
accompanied
by
our
kind
friends
hitchcock
and
wetmore
ohio
state
agent
generals
sigel
and
stahl
with
many
other
distinguished
personages
were
in
waiting
but
we
were
given
the
preference
and
at
once
admitted
the
secretary
conversed
with
us
most
affably
for
some
time
then
going
into
another
room
he
brought
out
see
engraving
all
are
similar
and
presented
them
to
us
saying
that
they
were
the
first
ever
given
to
private
soldiers
jacob
parrott
the
boy
who
endured
the
terrible
beating
received
as
he
well
deserved
the
first
one
illustration
the
medal
illustration
reverse
of
medal
he
next
presented
us
with
one
hundred
dollars
each
and
ordered
all
arrearages
to
be
paid
and
the
money
and
the
value
of
the
arms
taken
from
us
to
be
refunded
this
was
not
all
he
requested
governor
todd
to
promote
each
of
us
to
first
lieutenants
in
the
ohio
troops
and
if
he
failed
to
do
so
promised
to
give
us
that
grade
in
the
regular
army
we
then
received
furloughs
to
visit
our
homes
and
left
his
presence
profoundly
convinced
that
republics
are
not
always
ungrateful
we
were
then
escorted
by
our
friends
to
the
executive
mansion
and
had
a
most
pleasing
interview
with
our
noble
president
his
kindness
was
equal
to
that
of
the
secretary
after
relating
to
him
some
incidents
of
prison
experience
and
receiving
his
sympathizing
comments
we
took
our
leave
and
now
safe
in
a
land
of
freedom
with
the
consciousness
of
having
performed
our
duty
surrounded
by
fathers
and
mothers
brothers
and
sisters
wives
and
children
who
had
long
mourned
us
as
dead
our
dangers
past
and
our
sufferings
rewarded
i
drop
the
vail
the
end
