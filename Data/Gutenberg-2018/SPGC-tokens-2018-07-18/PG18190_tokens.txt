the
same
raggedy
ann
with
which
my
mother
played
when
a
child
there
she
sits
a
trifle
loppy
and
looking
me
squarely
in
the
face
in
a
straightforward
honest
manner
a
twinkle
where
her
eyes
reflect
the
electric
light
evidently
raggedy
has
been
to
a
tea
party
today
for
her
face
is
covered
with
chocolate
she
smiles
happily
and
continuously
true
she
has
been
nibbled
by
mice
who
have
made
nests
out
of
the
soft
cotton
with
which
she
has
been
stuffed
but
raggedy
smiled
just
as
broadly
when
the
mice
nibbled
at
her
for
her
smile
is
painted
on
what
adventures
you
must
have
had
raggedy
what
joy
and
happiness
you
have
brought
into
this
world
and
no
matter
what
treatment
you
have
received
how
patient

with
old
lovable
rag
dolls
soft
loppy
rag
dolls
who

through
all
the
wonders
of
fairyland
in
the
crook
of
dimpled
arms
snuggling
close
to
childish
breasts
within
which
beat
hearts
filled
with
eternal
sunshine

introduction
marcella
liked
to
play
up
in
the
attic
at
grandma
quaint
old
house
out
in
the
country
for
there
were
so
many
old
forgotten
things
to
find
up
there
one
day
when
marcella
was
up
in
the
attic
and
had
played
with
the
old
spinning
wheel
until
she
had
grown
tired
of
it
she
curled
up
on
an
old
sofa
to
rest
i
wonder
what
is
in
that
barrel
back
in
the
corner
she
thought
as
she
jumped
from
the
sofa
and
climbed
over
two
dusty
trunks
to
the
barrel
standing
back
under
the
eaves
it
was
quite
dark
back
there
so
when
marcella
had
pulled
a
large
bundle
of
things
from
the
barrel
she
took
them
over
to
the
dormer
window
where
she
could
see
better
there
was
a
funny
little
bonnet
with
long
white
ribbons
marcella
put
it
on
in
an
old
leather
bag
she
found
a
number
of
of
queer
looking
men
and
women
in
clothes
and
there
was
one
picture
of
a
very
pretty
little
girl
with
long
curls
tied
tightly
back
from
her
forehead
and
wearing
a
long
dress
and
queer
pantaloons
which
reached
to
her
and
then
out
of
the
heap
she
pulled
an
old
rag
doll
with
only
one
eye
and
a
painted
nose
and
a
smiling
mouth
her
dress
was
of
soft
material
blue
with
pretty
little
flowers
and
dots
all
over
it
forgetting
everything
else
in
the
happiness
of
her
find
marcella
caught
up
the
rag
doll
and
ran
downstairs
to
show
it
to
grandma
well
well
where
did
you
find
it
grandma
cried
it
old
raggedy
ann
she
went
on
as
she
hugged
the
doll
to
her
breast
i
had
forgotten
her
she
has
been
in
the
attic
for
fifty
years
i
guess
well
well
dear
old
raggedy
ann
i
will
sew
another
button
on
her
right
away
and
grandma
went
to
the
machine
drawer
and
got
her
needle
and
thread
marcella
watched
the
sewing
while
grandma
told
how
she
had
played
with
raggedy
ann
when
she
was
a
little
girl
now
grandma
laughed
raggedy
ann
you
have
two
fine
eyes
and
with
them
you
can
see
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
the
world
while
you
have
been
shut
up
so
long
in
the
attic
for
raggedy
ann
you
have
a
new
playmate
and
mistress
now
and
i
hope
you
both
will
have
as
much
happiness
together
as
you
and
i
used
to
have
then
grandma
gave
raggedy
ann
to
marcella
saying
very
seriously
marcella
let
me
introduce
my
very
dear
friend
raggedy
ann
raggedy
this
is
my
marcella
and
grandma
gave
the
doll
a
twitch
with
her
fingers
in
such
a
way
that
the
rag
doll
nodded
her
head
to
marcella
oh
grandma
thank
you
ever
and
ever
so
much
marcella
cried
as
she
gave
grandma
a
hug
and
kiss
raggedy
ann
and
i
will
have
just
loads
of
fun
and
this
is
how
raggedy
ann
joined
the
doll
family
at
marcella
house
where
she
began
the
adventures
of
raggedy
ann
told
in
the
following
stories
illustration
illustration
raggedy
ann
learns
a
lesson
one
day
the
dolls
were
left
all
to
themselves
their
little
mistress
had
placed
them
all
around
the
room
and
told
them
to
be
nice
children
while
she
was
away
and
there
they
sat
and
never
even
so
much
as
wiggled
a
finger
until
their
mistress
had
left
the
room
then
the
soldier
dolly
turned
his
head
and
solemnly
winked
at
raggedy
ann
and
when
the
front
gate
clicked
and
the
dollies
knew
they
were
alone
in
the
house
they
all
scrambled
to
their
feet
now
let
have
a
good
time
cried
the
tin
soldier
let
all
go
in
search
of
something
to
eat
yes
let
all
go
in
search
of
something
to
eat
cried
all
the
other
dollies
when
mistress
had
me
out
playing
with
her
this
morning
said
raggedy
ann
she
carried
me
by
a
door
near
the
back
of
the
house
and
i
smelled
something
which
smelled
as
if
it
would
taste
delicious
then
you
lead
the
way
raggedy
ann
cried
the
french
dolly
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
elect
raggedy
ann
as
our
leader
on
this
expedition
said
the
indian
doll
at
this
all
the
other
dolls
clapped
their
hands
together
and
shouted
hurrah
raggedy
ann
will
be
our
leader
so
raggedy
ann
very
proud
indeed
to
have
the
confidence
and
love
of
all
the
other
dollies
said
that
she
would
be
very
glad
to
be
their
leader
follow
me
she
cried
as
her
wobbly
legs
carried
her
across
the
floor
at
a
lively
pace
the
other
dollies
followed
racing
about
the
house
until
they
came
to
the
pantry
door
this
is
the
place
cried
raggedy
ann
and
sure
enough
all
the
dollies
smelled
something
which
they
knew
must
be
very
good
to
eat
but
none
of
the
dollies
was
tall
enough
to
open
the
door
and
although
they
pushed
and
pulled
with
all
their
might
the
door
remained
tightly
closed
the
dollies
were
talking
and
pulling
and
pushing
and
every
once
in
a
while
one
would
fall
over
and
the
others
would
step
on
her
in
their
efforts
to
open
the
door
finally
raggedy
ann
drew
away
from
the
others
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
when
the
other
dollies
discovered
raggedy
ann
sitting
there
running
her
rag
hands
through
her
yarn
hair
they
knew
she
was
thinking
sh
sh
they
said
to
each
other
and
quietly
went
over
near
raggedy
ann
and
sat
down
in
front
of
her
there
must
be
a
way
to
get
inside
said
raggedy
ann
raggedy
says
there
must
be
a
way
to
get
inside
cried
all
the
dolls
i
ca
seem
to
think
clearly
said
raggedy
ann
it
feels
as
if
my
head
were
ripped
at
this
the
french
doll
ran
to
raggedy
ann
and
took
off
her
bonnet
yes
there
is
a
rip
in
your
head
raggedy
she
said
and
pulled
a
pin
from
her
skirt
and
pinned
up
raggedy
head
it
not
a
very
neat
job
for
i
got
some
puckers
in
it
she
said
oh
that
is
ever
so
much
better
cried
raggedy
ann
now
i
can
think
quite
clearly
now
raggedy
can
think
quite
clearly
cried
all
the
dolls
my
thoughts
must
have
leaked
out
the
rip
before
said
raggedy
ann
illustration
illustration
they
must
have
leaked
out
before
dear
raggedy
cried
all
the
other
dolls
now
that
i
can
think
so
clearly
said
raggedy
ann
i
think
the
door
must
be
locked
and
to
get
in
we
must
unlock
it
that
will
be
easy
said
the
dutch
doll
who
says
mamma
when
he
is
tipped
backward
and
forward
for
we
will
have
the
brave
tin
soldier
shoot
the
key
out
of
the
lock
i
can
easily
do
that
cried
the
tin
soldier
as
he
raised
his
gun
oh
raggedy
ann
cried
the
french
dolly
please
do
not
let
him
shoot
no
said
raggedy
ann
we
must
think
of
a
quieter
way
after
thinking
quite
hard
for
a
moment
raggedy
ann
jumped
up
and
said
i
have
it
and
she
caught
up
the
jumping
jack
and
held
him
up
to
the
door
then
jack
slid
up
his
stick
and
unlocked
the
door
then
the
dollies
all
pushed
and
the
door
swung
open
my
such
a
scramble
the
dolls
piled
over
one
another
in
their
desire
to
be
the
first
at
the
goodies
they
swarmed
upon
the
pantry
shelves
and
in
their
eagerness
spilled
a
pitcher
of
cream
which
ran
all
over
the
french
dolly
dress
the
indian
doll
found
some
corn
bread
and
dipping
it
in
the
molasses
he
sat
down
for
a
good
feast
a
jar
of
raspberry
jam
was
overturned
and
the
dollies
ate
of
this
until
their
faces
were
all
purple
the
tin
soldier
fell
from
the
shelf
three
times
and
bent
one
of
his
tin
legs
but
he
scrambled
right
back
up
again
never
had
the
dolls
had
so
much
fun
and
excitement
and
they
had
all
eaten
their
fill
when
they
heard
the
click
of
the
front
gate
illustration
they
did
not
take
time
to
climb
from
the
shelves
but
all
rolled
or
jumped
off
to
the
floor
and
scrambled
back
to
their
room
as
fast
as
they
could
run
leaving
a
trail
of
bread
crumbs
and
jam
along
the
way
just
as
their
mistress
came
into
the
room
the
dolls
dropped
in
whatever
positions
they
happened
to
be
in
this
is
funny
cried
mistress
they
were
all
left
sitting
in
their
places
around
the
room
i
wonder
if
fido
has
been
shaking
them
up
then
she
saw
raggedy
ann
face
and
picked
her
up
why
raggedy
ann
you
are
all
sticky
i
do
believe
you
are
covered
with
jam
and
mistress
tasted
raggedy
ann
hand
yes
it
jam
shame
on
you
raggedy
ann
been
in
the
pantry
and
all
the
others
too
and
with
this
the
mistress
dropped
raggedy
ann
on
the
floor
and
left
the
room
when
she
came
back
she
had
on
an
apron
and
her
sleeves
were
rolled
up
she
picked
up
all
the
sticky
dolls
and
putting
them
in
a
basket
she
carried
them
out
under
the
apple
tree
in
the
garden
there
she
had
placed
her
little
tub
and
wringer
and
she
took
the
dolls
one
at
a
time
and
scrubbed
them
with
a
scrubbing
brush
and
soused
them
up
and
down
and
this
way
and
that
in
the
soap
suds
until
they
were
clean
then
she
hung
them
all
out
on
the
in
the
sunshine
to
dry
there
the
dolls
hung
all
day
swinging
and
twisting
about
as
the
breeze
swayed
the
i
do
believe
she
scrubbed
my
face
so
hard
she
wore
off
my
smile
said
raggedy
ann
after
an
hour
of
silence
illustration
illustration
no
it
is
still
there
said
the
tin
solder
as
the
wind
twisted
him
around
so
he
could
see
raggedy
but
i
do
believe
my
arms
will
never
work
without
squeaking
they
feel
so
rusted
he
added
just
then
the
wind
twisted
the
little
dutch
doll
and
loosened
his
so
that
he
fell
to
the
grass
below
with
a
sawdusty
bump
and
as
he
rolled
over
he
said
mamma
in
a
squeaky
voice
late
in
the
afternoon
the
back
door
opened
and
the
little
mistress
came
out
with
a
table
and
chairs
after
setting
the
table
she
took
all
the
dolls
from
the
line
and
placed
them
about
the
table
they
had
lemonade
with
grape
jelly
in
it
which
made
it
a
beautiful
lavender
color
and
little
with
powdered
sugar
on
them
after
this
lovely
dinner
the
dollies
were
taken
in
the
house
where
they
had
their
hair
brushed
and
nice
clean
nighties
put
on
then
they
were
placed
in
their
beds
and
mistress
kissed
each
one
good
night
and
tiptoed
from
the
room
all
the
dolls
lay
as
still
as
mice
for
a
few
minutes
then
raggedy
ann
raised
up
on
her
elbows
and
said
i
have
been
thinking
sh
said
all
the
other
dollies
raggedy
has
been
thinking
yes
said
raggedy
ann
i
have
been
thinking
our
mistress
gave
us
the
nice
dinner
out
under
the
trees
to
teach
us
a
lesson
she
wished
us
to
know
that
we
could
have
had
all
the
goodies
we
wished
whenever
we
wished
if
we
had
behaved
ourselves
and
our
lesson
was
that
we
must
never
take
without
asking
what
we
could
always
have
for
the
asking
so
let
us
all
remember
and
try
never
again
to
do
anything
which
might
cause
those
who
love
us
any
unhappiness
let
us
all
remember
chimed
all
the
other
dollies
illustration
and
raggedy
ann
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
her
eyes
lay
back
in
her
little
bed
her
cotton
head
filled
with
thoughts
of
love
and
happiness
illustration
illustration
raggedy
ann
and
the
washing
why
dinah
how
could
you
mamma
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
marcella
run
up
to
dinah
and
take
something
out
of
her
hand
and
then
put
her
head
in
her
arm
and
commence
crying
what
is
the
trouble
dear
mamma
asked
as
she
came
out
the
door
and
knelt
beside
the
little
figure
shaking
with
sobs
marcella
held
out
raggedy
ann
but
such
a
comical
looking
raggedy
ann
mamma
had
to
smile
in
spite
of
her
sympathy
for
raggedy
ann
looked
ridiculous
dinah
big
eyes
rolled
out
in
a
troubled
manner
for
marcella
had
snatched
raggedy
ann
from
dinah
hand
as
she
cried
why
dinah
how
could
you
dinah
could
not
quite
understand
and
as
she
dearly
loved
marcella
she
was
troubled
raggedy
ann
was
not
in
the
least
downhearted
and
while
she
felt
she
must
look
very
funny
she
continued
to
smile
but
with
a
more
expansive
smile
than
ever
before
raggedy
ann
knew
just
how
it
all
happened
and
her
remaining
eye
twinkled
she
remembered
that
morning
when
marcella
came
to
the
nursery
to
take
the
nighties
from
the
dolls
and
dress
them
she
had
been
cross
raggedy
ann
thought
at
the
time
perhaps
she
had
climbed
out
of
bed
backwards
for
marcella
complained
to
each
doll
as
she
dressed
them
and
when
it
came
raggedy
time
to
be
dressed
marcella
was
very
cross
for
she
had
scratched
her
finger
on
a
pin
when
dressing
the
french
doll
so
when
marcella
heard
the
little
girl
next
door
calling
to
her
she
ran
out
of
the
nursery
and
gave
raggedy
ann
a
toss
from
her
as
she
ran
now
it
happened
raggedy
lit
in
the
clothes
hamper
and
there
she
lay
all
doubled
up
in
a
knot
a
few
minutes
afterwards
dinah
came
through
the
hall
with
an
armful
of
clothes
and
piled
them
in
the
hamper
on
top
of
raggedy
ann
then
dinah
carried
the
hamper
out
in
back
of
the
house
where
she
did
the
washing
dinah
dumped
all
the
clothes
into
the
boiler
and
poured
water
on
them
the
boiler
was
then
placed
upon
the
stove
when
the
water
began
to
get
warm
raggedy
ann
wiggled
around
and
climbed
up
amongst
the
clothes
to
the
top
of
the
boiler
to
peek
out
there
was
too
much
steam
and
she
could
see
nothing
for
that
matter
dinah
could
not
see
raggedy
ann
either
on
account
of
the
steam
so
dinah
using
an
old
broom
handle
stirred
the
clothes
in
the
boiler
and
the
clothes
and
raggedy
ann
were
stirred
and
whirled
around
until
all
were
thoroughly
boiled
when
dinah
took
the
clothes
a
piece
at
a
time
from
the
boiler
and
scrubbed
them
she
finally
came
upon
raggedy
ann
now
dinah
did
not
know
but
that
marcella
had
placed
raggedy
in
the
clothes
hamper
to
be
washed
so
she
soaped
raggedy
well
and
scrubbed
her
up
and
down
over
the
rough
illustration
two
buttons
from
the
back
of
raggedy
dress
came
off
and
one
of
raggedy
ann
eyes
was
loosened
as
dinah
gave
her
face
a
final
scrub
illustration
then
dinah
put
raggedy
ann
feet
in
the
wringer
and
turned
the
crank
it
was
hard
work
getting
raggedy
through
the
wringer
but
dinah
was
very
strong
and
of
course
it
happened
raggedy
ann
came
through
as
flat
as
a
pancake
it
was
just
then
that
marcella
returned
and
saw
raggedy
why
dinah
how
could
you
marcella
had
sobbed
as
she
snatched
the
flattened
raggedy
ann
from
the
bewildered
dinah
hand
mamma
patted
marcella
hand
and
soon
coaxed
her
to
quit
sobbing
when
dinah
explained
that
the
first
she
knew
of
raggedy
being
in
the
wash
was
when
she
took
her
from
the
boiler
marcella
began
crying
again
it
was
all
my
fault
mamma
she
cried
i
remember
now
that
i
threw
dear
old
raggedy
ann
from
me
as
i
ran
out
the
door
and
she
must
have
fallen
in
the
clothes
hamper
oh
dear
oh
dear
and
she
hugged
raggedy
ann
tight
mamma
did
not
tell
marcella
that
she
had
been
cross
and
naughty
for
she
knew
marcella
felt
very
sorry
instead
mamma
put
her
arms
around
her
and
said
just
see
how
raggedy
ann
takes
it
she
does
seem
to
be
unhappy
and
when
marcella
brushed
her
tears
away
and
looked
at
raggedy
ann
flat
as
a
pancake
and
with
a
cheery
smile
upon
her
painted
face
she
had
to
laugh
and
mamma
and
dinah
had
to
laugh
too
for
raggedy
ann
smile
was
almost
twice
as
broad
as
it
had
been
before
just
let
me
hang
miss
raggedy
on
the
line
in
the
bright
sunshine
for
half
an
hour
said
dinah
and
you
wo
know
her
when
she
comes
off
so
raggedy
ann
was
pinned
to
the
out
in
the
bright
sunshine
where
she
swayed
and
twisted
in
the
breeze
and
listened
to
the
chatter
of
the
robins
in
a
nearby
tree
illustration
every
once
in
a
while
dinah
went
out
and
rolled
and
patted
raggedy
until
her
cotton
stuffing
was
soft
and
dry
and
fluffy
and
her
head
and
arms
and
legs
were
nice
and
round
again
then
she
took
raggedy
ann
into
the
house
and
showed
marcella
and
mamma
how
clean
and
sweet
she
was
marcella
took
raggedy
ann
right
up
to
the
nursery
and
told
all
the
dolls
just
what
had
happened
and
how
sorry
she
was
that
she
had
been
so
cross
and
peevish
when
she
dressed
them
and
while
the
dolls
said
never
a
word
they
looked
at
their
little
mistress
with
love
in
their
eyes
as
she
sat
in
the
little
red
rocking
chair
and
held
raggedy
ann
tightly
in
her
arms
and
raggedy
ann
remaining
eye
looked
up
at
her
little
mistress
in
rather
a
saucy
manner
but
upon
her
face
was
the
same
old
smile
of
happiness
good
humor
and
love
illustration

raggedy
ann
and
the
kite
raggedy
ann
watched
with
interest
the
preparations
a
number
of
sticks
were
being
fastened
together
with
strings
and
covered
with
light
cloth
raggedy
ann
heard
some
of
the
boys
talk
of
the
kite
so
raggedy
ann
knew
this
must
be
a
kite
when
a
tail
had
been
fastened
to
the
kite
and
a
large
ball
of
heavy
twine
tied
to
the
front
one
of
the
boys
held
the
kite
up
in
the
air
and
another
boy
walked
off
unwinding
the
ball
of
twine
there
was
a
nice
breeze
blowing
so
the
boy
with
the
twine
called
let
go
and
started
running
marcella
held
raggedy
up
so
that
she
could
watch
the
kite
sail
through
the
air
how
nicely
it
climbed
but
suddenly
the
kite
acted
strangely
and
as
all
the
children
shouted
advice
to
the
boy
with
the
ball
of
twine
the
kite
began
darting
this
way
and
that
and
finally
making
four
or
five
it
crashed
to
the
ground
it
needs
more
tail
on
it
one
boy
shouted
then
the
children
asked
each
other
where
they
might
get
more
rags
to
fasten
to
the
tail
of
the
kite
let
tie
raggedy
ann
to
the
tail
suggested
marcella
i
know
she
would
enjoy
a
trip
up
in
the
sky
the
boys
all
shouted
with
delight
at
this
new
suggestion
so
raggedy
ann
was
tied
to
the
tail
of
the
kite
this
time
the
kite
rose
straight
in
the
air
and
remained
steady
the
boy
with
the
ball
of
twine
unwound
it
until
the
kite
and
raggedy
ann
were
up
and
far
away
how
raggedy
ann
enjoyed
being
up
there
she
could
see
for
miles
and
miles
and
how
tiny
the
children
looked
suddenly
a
great
puff
of
wind
came
and
carried
raggedy
ann
streaming
out
behind
the
kite
she
could
hear
the
wind
singing
on
the
twine
as
the
strain
increased
suddenly
raggedy
ann
felt
something
rip
it
was
the
rag
to
which
she
was
tied
as
each
puff
of
wind
caught
her
the
rip
widened
when
marcella
watched
raggedy
ann
rise
high
above
the
field
she
wondered
how
much
raggedy
ann
enjoyed
it
and
wished
that
she
too
might
have
gone
along
but
after
the
kite
had
been
up
in
the
air
for
five
or
ten
minutes
marcella
grew
restless
kites
were
rather
tiresome
there
was
more
fun
in
tea
parties
out
under
the
apple
tree
will
you
please
pull
down
the
kite
now
she
asked
the
boy
with
the
twine
i
want
raggedy
ann
let
her
ride
up
there
the
boy
replied
we
bring
her
home
when
we
pull
down
the
kite
we
going
to
get
another
ball
of
twine
and
let
her
go
higher
marcella
did
not
like
to
leave
raggedy
ann
with
the
boys
so
she
sat
down
upon
the
ground
to
wait
until
they
pulled
down
the
kite
but
while
marcella
watched
raggedy
ann
a
dot
in
the
sky
she
could
not
see
the
wind
ripping
the
rag
to
which
raggedy
was
tied
suddenly
the
rag
parted
and
raggedy
ann
went
sailing
away
as
the
wind
caught
in
her
skirts
marcella
jumped
from
the
ground
too
surprised
to
say
anything
the
kite
released
from
the
weight
of
raggedy
ann
began
darting
and
swooping
to
the
ground
illustration
illustration
we
get
her
for
you
some
of
the
boys
said
when
they
saw
troubled
face
and
they
started
running
in
the
direction
raggedy
ann
had
fallen
marcella
and
the
other
girls
ran
with
them
they
ran
and
they
ran
and
they
ran
and
at
last
they
found
the
kite
upon
the
ground
with
one
of
the
sticks
broken
but
they
could
not
find
raggedy
ann
anywhere
she
must
have
fallen
almost
in
your
yard
a
boy
said
to
marcella
for
the
kite
was
directly
over
here
when
the
doll
fell
marcella
was
heartbroken
she
went
in
the
house
and
lay
on
the
bed
mamma
went
out
with
the
children
and
tried
to
find
raggedy
ann
but
raggedy
ann
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
when
daddy
came
home
in
the
evening
he
tried
to
find
raggedy
but
met
with
no
success
marcella
had
eaten
hardly
any
dinner
nor
could
she
be
comforted
by
mamma
or
daddy
the
other
dolls
in
the
nursery
lay
forgotten
and
were
not
put
to
bed
that
night
for
marcella
lay
and
sobbed
and
tossed
about
her
bed
finally
she
said
a
little
prayer
for
raggedy
ann
and
went
to
sleep
and
as
she
slept
marcella
dreamed
that
the
fairies
came
and
took
raggedy
ann
with
them
to
fairyland
for
a
visit
and
then
sent
raggedy
ann
home
to
her
she
awakened
with
a
cry
of
course
mamma
came
to
her
bed
right
away
and
said
that
daddy
would
offer
a
reward
in
the
morning
for
the
return
of
raggedy
it
was
all
my
fault
mamma
marcella
said
i
should
not
have
offered
the
boys
dear
old
raggedy
ann
to
tie
on
the
tail
of
the
kite
but
i
just
know
the
fairies
will
send
her
back
mamma
took
her
in
her
arms
and
soothed
her
with
cheering
words
although
she
felt
indeed
that
raggedy
ann
was
truly
lost
and
would
never
be
found
again
now
where
do
you
suppose
raggedy
ann
was
all
this
time
illustration
when
raggedy
ann
dropped
from
the
kite
the
wind
caught
in
her
skirts
and
carried
her
along
until
she
fell
in
the
fork
of
the
large
elm
tree
directly
over
marcella
house
when
raggedy
ann
fell
with
a
thud
face
up
in
the
fork
of
the
tree
two
robins
who
had
a
nest
near
by
flew
chattering
away
presently
the
robins
returned
and
quarreled
at
raggedy
ann
for
laying
so
close
to
their
nest
but
raggedy
ann
only
smiled
at
them
and
did
not
move
when
the
robins
quieted
down
and
quit
their
quarreling
one
of
them
hopped
up
closer
to
raggedy
ann
in
order
to
investigate
it
was
mamma
robin
she
called
to
daddy
robin
and
told
him
to
come
see
the
nice
yarn
we
could
use
it
to
line
the
nest
with
she
said
so
the
robins
hopped
closer
to
raggedy
ann
and
asked
if
they
might
have
some
of
her
yarn
hair
to
line
their
nest
raggedy
ann
smiled
at
them
so
the
two
robins
pulled
and
tugged
at
raggedy
ann
yarn
hair
until
they
had
enough
to
line
their
nest
nice
and
soft
evening
came
and
the
robins
sang
their
good
night
songs
and
raggedy
ann
watched
the
stars
come
out
twinkle
all
night
and
disappear
in
the
morning
light
in
the
morning
the
robins
again
pulled
yarn
from
raggedy
ann
head
and
loosened
her
so
she
could
peep
over
the
side
of
the
limb
and
when
the
sun
came
up
raggedy
ann
saw
she
was
in
the
trees
in
her
own
yard
now
before
she
could
eat
any
breakfast
marcella
started
out
to
find
raggedy
ann
and
it
was
marcella
herself
who
found
her
and
this
is
how
she
did
it
mamma
robin
had
seen
marcella
with
raggedy
ann
out
in
the
yard
many
times
so
she
began
calling
cheery
cheery
and
daddy
robin
started
calling
cheery
cheery
cheer
up
cheer
up
cheerily
cheerily
cheery
cheery
and
marcella
looking
up
into
the
tree
above
the
house
to
see
the
robins
discovered
raggedy
ann
peeping
over
the
limb
at
her
illustration
oh
how
her
heart
beat
with
happiness
here
is
raggedy
ann
she
shouted
and
mamma
and
daddy
came
out
and
saw
raggedy
smiling
at
them
and
daddy
got
the
clothes
prop
and
climbed
out
of
the
attic
window
and
poked
raggedy
ann
out
of
the
tree
and
she
fell
right
into
marcella
arms
where
she
was
hugged
in
a
tight
embrace
you
never
go
up
on
a
kite
again
raggedy
ann
said
marcella
for
i
felt
so
lost
without
you
i
will
never
let
you
leave
me
again
so
raggedy
ann
went
into
the
house
and
had
breakfast
with
her
little
mistress
and
mamma
and
daddy
smiled
at
each
other
when
they
peeped
through
the
door
into
the
breakfast
room
for
raggedy
ann
smile
was
wide
and
very
yellow
marcella
her
heart
full
of
happiness
was
feeding

it
was
almost
midnight
and
the
dolls
were
asleep
in
their
beds
all
except
raggedy

raggedy
lay
there
her
eyes
staring
straight
up
at
the
ceiling
every
once
in
a
while
raggedy
ann
ran
her
rag
hand
up
through
her
yarn
hair
she
was
thinking
when
she
had
thought
for
a
long
long
time
raggedy
ann
raised
herself
on
her
wabbly
elbows
and
said
i
thought
it
all
out
at
this
the
other
dolls
shook
each
other
and
raised
up
saying
listen
raggedy
has
thought
it
all
out
tell

raggedy
said
the
tin

we
hope
they
were
pleasant

very
pleasant

said
raggedy
as
she
brushed
a
tear
from
her
eyes
you
have
seen
fido
all
day
have
you
not
since
early
this
morning
the
french
dolly
said
it
has
troubled
me
said
raggedy
and
if
my
head
was
not
stuffed
with
lovely
new
white
cotton
i
am
sure
it
would
have
ached
with
the
worry
when
mistress
took
me
into
the
this
afternoon
she
was
crying
and
i
heard
her
mamma
say
will
find
him
he
is
sure
to
come
home
soon
and
i
knew
they
were
talking
of
fido
he
must
be
lost
the
tin

jumped
out
of
bed
and
ran
over
to
fido

his
tin

clicking
on
the
floor
as

went
he
is

said
when
i
was
sitting
in

window
about
said
the
indian
doll
i
saw
fido
and
a
yellow
scraggly
dog
playing
out
on
the
lawn
and
they
ran
out
through
a
hole
in
the
fence
that
was
priscilla

peterkins
said
the
french
doll
i
know
poor
mistress
is
very
sad
on
account
of
fido
said
the
dutch
doll
because
i
was
in
the
at
and
i
heard
her
daddy
tell
her
to
eat
her
supper
and
he
would
go
out
and
find
fido
but
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
until
now
that
is
the
trouble
with
all
of
us
except
raggedy
ann
cried
the
little
penny
doll
in
a
squeaky
voice
she
has
to
think
for
all
of
us
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
plan
for
us
to
show
our
love
for
mistress
and
try
and
find
fido
exclaimed
raggedy
it
is
a
good
plan
raggedy
ann
cried
all
the
dolls
tell
us
how
to
start
about
it
well
first
let
us
go
out
upon
the
lawn
and
see
if
we
can
track
the
dogs
said
raggedy
i
can
track
them
easily
the
indian
doll
said
for
indians
are
good
at
trailing
things
then
let
us
waste
no
more
time
in
talking
said
raggedy
ann
as
she
jumped
from
bed
followed
by
the
rest
the
nursery
window
was
open
so
the
dolls
helped
each
other
up
on
the
sill
and
then
jumped
to
the
soft
grass
below
they
fell
in
all
sorts
of
queer
attitudes
but
of
course
the
fall
did
not
hurt
them
at
the
hole
in
the
fence
the
indian
doll
picked
up
the
trail
of
the
two
dogs
and
the
dolls
stringing
out
behind
followed
him
until
they
came
to
peterkins
house
peterkins
was
surprised
to
see
the
strange
little
figures
in
white
nighties
come
stringing
up
the
path
to
the
dog
house
illustration

peterkins
was
too
large
to
sleep
in

so
he
had
a
nice
cozy
under
the
grape
arbor
come
in
peterkins
said
when
he
saw
and
recognized
the
dolls
so
all
the
dollies
went
into
peterkins
house
and
sat
about
while
raggedy
told
him
why
they
had
come
it
has
worried
me
too
said
peterkins
but
i
had
no
way
of
telling
your
mistress
where
fido
was
for
she
can
not
understand
dog
language
for
you
see
peterkins
continued
fido
and
i
were
having
the
grandest
romp
over
in
the
park
when
a
great
big
man
with
a
funny
thing
on
the
end
of
a
stick
came
running
towards
us
we
barked
at
him
and
fido
thought
he
was
trying
to
play
with
us
and
went
up
too
close
and
do
you
know
that
wicked
man
caught
fido
in
the
thing
at
the
end
of
the
stick
and
carried
him
to
a
wagon
and
dumped
him
in
with

lot
of
other
dogs

he
wiped
his
eyes
with
his
paws
it
was
the
dog
catcher
for
i
followed
the
wagon
at
a
distance
and
i
saw
him
put
all
the
dogs
into
a
big
wire
pen
so
that
none
could
get
out
then
you
know
the
way
there
peterkins
asked
raggedy
ann
yes
i
can
find
it
easily
peterkins
said
then
show
us
the
way
raggedy
ann
cried
for
we
must
try
to
rescue
fido
so
peterkins
led
the
way
up
alleys
and
across
streets
the
dolls
all
pattering
along
behind
him
it
was
a
strange
procession
once
a
strange
dog
ran
out
at
them
but
peterkins
told
him
to
mind
his
own
business
and
the
strange
dog
returned
to
his
own
yard
at
last
they
came
to
the
dog
catcher
place
some
of
the
dogs
in
the
pen
were
barking
at
the
moon
and
others
were
whining
and
crying
illustration
there
was
fido
all
covered
with
mud
and
his
pretty
red
ribbon
dragging
on
the
ground
my
but
he
was
glad
to
see
the
dolls
and
peterkins
all
the
dogs
came
to
the
side
of
the
pen
and
twisted
their
heads
from
side
to
side
gazing
in
wonder
at
the
queer
figures
of
the
dolls
we
will
try
and
let
you
out
said
raggedy
ann
at
this
all
the
dogs
barked
joyfully
then
raggedy
ann
the
other
dolls
and
peterkins
went
to
the
gate
the
catch
was
too
high
for
raggedy
ann
to
reach
but
peterkins
held
raggedy
ann
in
his
mouth
and
stood
up
on
his
hind
legs
so
that
she
could
raise
the
catch
when
the
catch
was
raised
the
dogs
were
so
anxious
to
get
out
they
pushed
and
jumped
against
the
gate
so
hard
it
flew
open
knocking
peterkins
and
raggedy
ann
into
the
mud
such
a
yapping
and
barking
was
never
heard
in
the
neighborhood
as
when
the
dogs
swarmed
out
of
the
enclosure
jumping
over
one
another
and
scrambling
about
in
the
mad
rush
out
the
gate
fido
picked
himself
up
from
where
he
had
been
rolled
by
the
large
dogs
and
helped
raggedy
ann
to
her
feet
he
peterkins
and
all
the
dolls
ran
after
the
pack
of
dogs
turning
the
corner
just
as
the
dog
catcher
came
running
out
of
the
house
in
his
nightgown
to
see
what
was
causing
the
trouble
he
stopped
in
astonishment
when
he
saw
the
string
of
dolls
in
white
nighties
pattering
down
the
alley
for
he
could
not
imagine
what
they
were
well
you
may
be
sure
the
dolls
thanked
peterkins
for
his
kind
assistance
and
they
and
fido
ran
on
home
for
a
faint
light
was
beginning
to
show
in
the
east
where
the
sun
was
getting
ready
to
come
up
when
they
got
to
their
own
home
they
found
an
old
chair
out
in
the
yard
and
after
a
great
deal
of
work
they
finally
dragged
it
to
the
window
and
thus
managed
to
get
into
the
nursery
again
fido
was
very
grateful
to
raggedy
ann
and
the
other
dolls
and
before
he
went
to
his
basket
he
gave
them
each
a
lick
on
the
cheek
illustration
the
dolls
lost
no
time
in
scrambling
into
bed
and
pulling
up
the
covers
for
they
were
very
sleepy
but
just
as
they
were
dozing
off
raggedy
ann
raised
herself
and
said
if
my
legs
and
arms
were
not
stuffed
with
nice
clean
cotton
i
feel
sure
they
would
ache
but
being
stuffed
with
nice
clean
white
cotton
they
do
not
ache
and
i
could
not
feel
happier
if
my
body
were
stuffed
with
sunshine
for
i
know
how
pleased
and
happy
mistress
will
be
in
the
morning
when
she
discovers
fido
asleep
in
his
own
little
basket
safe
and
sound
at
home
and
as
the
dollies
by
this
time
were
all
asleep
raggedy
ann
pulled
the
sheet
up
to
her
chin
and
smiled
so
hard
she
ripped
two
stitches
out
of
the
back
of
her
rag
head
illustration
illustration
raggedy
ann
and
the
painter
when
housecleaning
time
came
around
mistress
mamma
decided
that
she
would
have
the
nursery
repainted
and
new
paper
put
upon
the
walls
that
was
why
all
the
dolls
happened
to
be
laid
upon
one
of
the
high
shelves
mistress
had
been
in
to
look
at
them
and
wished
to
put
them
to
bed
but
as
the
painters
were
coming
again
in
the
early
morning
mamma
thought
it
best
that
their
beds
be
piled
in
the
closet
so
the
dolls
beds
were
piled
into
the
closet
one
on
top
of
another
and
the
dolls
were
placed
upon
the
high
shelf
when
all
was
quiet
that
night
raggedy
ann
who
was
on
the
bottom
of
the
pile
of
dolls
spoke
softly
and
asked
the
others
if
they
would
mind
moving
along
the
shelf
the
cotton
in
my
body
is
getting
mashed
as
flat
as
a
pancake
said
raggedy
ann
and
although
the
tin
soldier
was
piled
so
that
his
foot
was
pressed
into
raggedy
face
she
still
wore
her
customary
smile
so
the
dolls
began
moving
off
to
one
side
until
raggedy
ann
was
free
to
sit
up
ah
that
a
great
deal
better
she
said
stretching
her
arms
and
legs
to
get
the
kinks
out
of
them
and
patting
her
dress
into
shape
well
i
be
glad
when
morning
comes
she
said
finally
for
i
know
mistress
will
take
us
out
in
the
yard
and
play
with
us
under
the
trees
so
the
dolls
sat
and
talked
until
daylight
when
the
painters
came
to
work
one
of
the
painters
a
young
fellow
seeing
the
dolls
reached
up
and
took
raggedy
ann
down
from
the
shelf
look
at
this
rag
doll
jim
he
said
to
one
of
the
other
painters
she
a
daisy
and
he
took
raggedy
ann
by
the
hands
and
danced
with
her
while
he
whistled
a
lively
tune
raggedy
ann
heels
hit
the
floor
and
she
enjoyed
it
immensely
the
other
dolls
sat
upon
the
shelf
and
looked
straight
before
them
for
it
would
never
do
to
let
men
know
that
dolls
were
really
alive
better
put
her
back
upon
the
shelf
said
one
of
the
other
men
have
the
little
girl
after
you
the
chances
are
that
she
likes
that
old
rag
doll
better
than
any
of
the
others
but
the
young
painter
twisted
raggedy
ann
into
funny
attitudes
and
laughed
and
laughed
as
she
looped
about
finally
he
got
to
tossing
her
up
in
the
air
and
catching
her
this
was
great
fun
for
raggedy
and
as
she
sailed
up
by
the
shelf
the
dolls
all
smiled
at
her
for
it
pleased
them
whenever
raggedy
ann
was
happy
but
the
young
fellow
threw
raggedy
ann
up
into
the
air
once
too
often
and
when
she
came
down
he
failed
to
catch
her
and
she
came
down
head
first
into
a
bucket
of
oily
paint
i
told
you
said
the
older
painter
and
now
you
are
in
for
it
my
goodness
i
did
mean
to
do
it
said
the
young
fellow
what
had
i
better
do
with
her
better
put
her
back
on
the
shelf
replied
the
other
so
raggedy
was
placed
back
upon
the
shelf
and
the
paint
ran
from
her
head
and
trickled
down
upon
her
dress
illustration
illustration
after
breakfast
mistress
came
into
the
nursery
and
saw
raggedy
all
covered
with
paint
and
she
began
crying
the
young
painter
felt
sorry
and
told
her
how
it
had
happened
if
you
will
let
me
he
said
i
will
take
her
home
with
me
and
will
clean
her
up
tonight
and
will
bring
her
back
day
after
tomorrow
so
raggedy
was
wrapped
in
a
newspaper
that
evening
and
carried
away
all
the
dolls
felt
sad
that
night
without
raggedy
ann
near
them
poor
raggedy
i
could
have
cried
when
i
saw
her
all
covered
with
paint
said
the
french
doll
she
did
look
like
our
dear
old
raggedy
ann
at
all
said
the
tin
soldier
who
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
so
that
they
would
not
run
down
on
his
arms
and
rust
them
the
paint
covered
her
lovely
smile
and
nose
and
you
could
not
see
the
laughter
in
her
eyes
said
the
indian
doll
and
so
the
dolls
talked
that
night
and
the
next
but
in
the
daytime
when
the
painters
were
there
they
kept
very
quiet
the
second
day
raggedy
was
brought
home
and
the
dolls
were
all
anxious
for
night
to
come
so
that
they
could
see
and
talk
with
raggedy
ann
at
last
the
painters
left
and
the
house
was
quiet
for
mistress
had
been
in
and
placed
raggedy
on
the
shelf
with
the
other
dolls
tell
us
all
about
it
raggedy
dear
the
dolls
cried
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
fell
in
the
paint
cried
raggedy
after
she
had
hugged
all
the
dolls
for
i
have
had
the
happiest
time
the
painter
took
me
home
and
told
his
mamma
how
i
happened
to
be
covered
with
paint
and
she
was
very
sorry
she
took
a
rag
and
wiped
off
my
eyes
and
then
i
saw
that
she
was
a
very
pretty
lady
and
she
got
some
cleaner
and
wiped
off
most
of
the
paint
on
my
face
illustration
but
you
know
raggedy
continued
the
paint
had
soaked
through
my
rag
head
and
had
made
the
cotton
inside
all
sticky
and
soggy
and
i
could
not
think
clearly
and
my
yarn
hair
was
all
matted
with
paint
so
the
kind
lady
took
off
my
yarn
hair
and
cut
the
stitches
out
of
my
head
and
took
out
all
the
painty
cotton
it
was
a
great
relief
although
it
felt
queer
at
first
and
my
thoughts
seemed
scattered
she
left
me
in
her
that
night
and
hung
me
out
upon
the
the
next
morning
when
she
had
washed
the
last
of
the
paint
off
and
while
i
hung
out
on
the
what
do
you
think
we
could
never
guess
all
the
dolls
cried
why
a
dear
little
jenny
wren
came
and
picked
enough
cotton
out
of
me
to
make
a
cute
little
cuddly
nest
in
the
grape
arbor
was
that
sweet
cried
all
the
dolls
yes
indeed
it
was
replied
raggedy
ann
it
made
me
very
happy
then
when
the
lady
took
me
in
the
house
again
she
stuffed
me
with
lovely
nice
new
cotton
all
the
way
from
my
knees
up
and
sewed
me
up
and
put
new
yarn
on
my
head
for
hair
and
and
and
it
a
secret
said
raggedy
ann
oh
tell
us
the
secret
cried
all
the
dolls
as
they
pressed
closer
to
raggedy
well
i
know
you
will
not
tell
anyone
who
would
not
be
glad
to
know
about
it
so
i
will
tell
you
the
secret
and
why
i
am
wearing
my
smile
a
trifle
broader
said
raggedy
ann
the
dolls
all
said
that
raggedy
ann
smile
was
indeed
a
quarter
of
an
inch
wider
on
each
side
illustration
when
the
dear
lady
put
the
new
white
cotton
in
my
body
said
raggedy
ann
she
went
to
the
cupboard
and
came
back
with
a
paper
bag
and
she
took
from
the
bag
ten
or
fifteen
little
candy
hearts
with
mottos
on
them
and
she
hunted
through
the
candy
hearts
until
she
found
a
beautiful
red
one
which
she
sewed
up
in
me
with
the
cotton
so
that
is
the
secret
and
that
is
why
i
am
so
happy
feel
here
said
raggedy
ann
all
the
dolls
could
feel
raggedy
ann
beautiful
new
candy
heart
and
they
were
very
happy
for
her
after
all
had
hugged
each
other
good
night
and
had
cuddled
up
for
the
night
the
tin
soldier
asked
did
you
have
a
chance
to
see
what
the
motto
on
your
new
candy
heart
was
raggedy
ann
oh
yes
replied
raggedy
ann
i
was
so
happy
i
forgot
to
tell
you
it
had
printed
upon
it
in
nice
blue
letters
love
you

trip
on
the
river
when
marcella
had
a
tea
party
out
in
the
orchard
of
course
all
of
the
dolls
were
invited
raggedy
ann
the
tin
soldier
the
indian
doll
and
all
the
others
even
the
four
little
penny
dolls
in
the
spool
box
after
a
lovely
tea
party
with
ginger
cookies
and
milk
of
course
the
dolls
were
very
sleepy
at
least
marcella
thought
so
so
she
took
all
except
raggedy
ann
into
the
house
and
put
them
to
bed
for
the
afternoon
nap
then
marcella
told
raggedy
ann
to
stay
there
and
watch
the
things
as
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
raggedy
ann
waited
for
marcella
to
return
and
as
she
watched
the
little
ants
eating
cookie
crumbs
marcella
had
thrown
to
them
she
heard
all
of
a
sudden
the
patter
of
puppy
feet
behind
her
it
was
fido
the
puppy
dog
ran
up
to
raggedy
ann
and
twisted
his
head
about
as
he
looked
at
her
then
he
put
his
front
feet
out
and
barked
in
raggedy
ann
face
raggedy
ann
tried
to
look
very
stern
but
she
could
not
hide
the
broad
smile
painted
on
her
face
oh
you
want
to
play
do
you
the
puppy
dog
barked
as
he
jumped
at
raggedy
ann
and
then
jumped
back
again
the
more
raggedy
ann
smiled
the
livelier
fido
antics
became
until
finally
he
caught
the
end
of
her
dress
and
dragged
her
about
this
was
great
fun
for
the
puppy
dog
but
raggedy
ann
did
not
enjoy
it
she
kicked
and
twisted
as
much
as
she
could
but
the
puppy
dog
thought
raggedy
was
playing
he
ran
out
the
garden
gate
and
down
the
path
across
the
meadow
every
once
in
a
while
stopping
and
pretending
he
was
very
angry
when
he
pretended
this
fido
would
give
raggedy
ann
a
great
shaking
making
her
yarn
head
hit
the
ground
then
he
would
give
his
head
a
toss
and
send
raggedy
ann
high
in
the
air
where
she
would
turn
over
two
or
three
times
before
she
reached
the
ground
by
this
time
she
had
lost
her
apron
and
now
some
of
her
yarn
hair
was
coming
loose
as
fido
neared
the
brook
another
puppy
dog
came
running
across
the
to
meet
him
what
have
you
there
fido
said
the
new
puppy
dog
as
he
bounced
up
to
raggedy
ann
this
is
raggedy
ann
answered
fido
she
and
i
are
having
a
lovely
time
playing
you
see
fido
really
thought
raggedy
enjoyed
being
tossed
around
and
whirled
high
up
in
the
air
but
of
course
she
did
however
the
game
did
last
much
longer
as
raggedy
ann
hit
the
ground
the
new
puppy
dog
caught
her
dress
and
ran
with
her
across
the
bridge
fido
barking
close
behind
him
in
the
center
of
the
bridge
fido
caught
up
with
the
new
puppy
dog
and
they
had
a
lively
with
raggedy
ann
stretched
between
then
as
they
pulled
and
tugged
and
flopped
raggedy
ann
about
somehow
she
fell
over
the
side
of
the
bridge
into
the
water
the
puppy
dogs
were
surprised
and
fido
was
very
sorry
indeed
for
he
remembered
how
good
raggedy
ann
had
been
to
him
and
how
she
had
rescued
him
from
the
but
the
current
carried
raggedy
ann
right
along
and
all
fido
could
do
was
to
run
along
the
bank
and
bark
illustration
illustration
now
you
would
have
thought
raggedy
ann
would
sink
but
no
she
floated
nicely
for
she
was
stuffed
with
clean
white
cotton
and
the
water
soak
through
very
quickly
after
a
while
the
strange
puppy
and
fido
grew
tired
of
running
along
the
bank
and
the
strange
puppy
scampered
home
over
the
meadow
with
his
tail
carried
gaily
over
his
back
as
if
he
had
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
but
fido
walked
home
very
sorry
indeed
his
little
heart
was
broken
to
think
that
he
had
caused
raggedy
ann
to
be
drowned
but
raggedy
ann
did
drown
not
a
bit
of
it
in
fact
she
even
went
to
sleep
on
the
brook
for
the
motion
of
the
current
was
very
soothing
as
it
carried
her
along
just
like
being
rocked
by
marcella
so
sleeping
peacefully
raggedy
ann
drifted
along
with
the
current
until
she
came
to
a
pool
where
she
lodged
against
a
large
stone
raggedy
ann
tried
to
climb
upon
the
stone
but
by
this
time
the
water
had
thoroughly
soaked
through
raggedy
ann
nice
clean
white
cotton
stuffing
and
she
was
so
heavy
she
could
not
climb
so
there
she
had
to
stay
until
marcella
and
daddy
came
along
and
found
her
you
see
they
had
been
looking
for
her
they
had
found
pieces
of
her
apron
all
along
the
path
and
across
the
meadow
where
fido
and
the
strange
puppy
dog
had
shaken
them
from
raggedy
ann
so
they
followed
the
brook
until
they
found
her
when
daddy
fished
raggedy
ann
from
the
water
marcella
hugged
her
so
tightly
to
her
breast
the
water
ran
from
raggedy
ann
and
dripped
all
over
marcella
apron
but
marcella
was
so
glad
to
find
raggedy
ann
again
she
did
mind
it
a
bit
she
just
hurried
home
and
took
off
all
of
raggedy
ann
wet
clothes
and
placed
her
on
a
little
red
chair
in
front
of
the
oven
door
and
then
brought
all
of
the
other
dolls
in
and
read
a
fairy
tale
to
them
while
raggedy
ann
steamed
and
dried
illustration
when
raggedy
ann
was
thoroughly
dry
mamma
said
she
thought
the
cake
must
be
finished
and
she
took
from
the
oven
a
lovely
chocolate
cake
and
gave
marcella
a
large
piece
to
have
another
tea
party
with
that
night
when
all
the
house
was
asleep
raggedy
ann
raised
up
in
bed
and
said
to
the
dolls
who
were
still
awake
i
am
so
happy
i
do
not
feel
a
bit
sleepy
do
you
know
i
believe
the
water
soaked
me
so
thoroughly
my
candy
heart
must
have
melted
and
filled
my
whole
body
and
i
do
not
feel
the
least
bit
angry
with
fido
for
playing
with
me
so
roughly
so
all
the
other
dolls
were
happy
too
for
happiness
is
very
easy
to
catch
when
we
love
one
another
and
are
sweet
all
through
illustration
illustration
raggedy
ann
and
the
strange
dolls
raggedy
ann
lay
just
as
marcella
had
dropped
her
all
sprawled
out
with
her
rag
arms
and
legs
twisted
in
ungraceful
attitudes
her
yarn
hair
was
twisted
and
lay
partly
over
her
face
hiding
one
of
her
eyes
raggedy
gave
no
sign
that
she
had
heard
but
lay
there
smiling
at
the
ceiling
perhaps
raggedy
ann
knew
that
what
the
new
dolls
said
was
true
but
sometimes
the
truth
may
hurt
and
this
may
have
been
the
reason
raggedy
ann
lay
there
so
still
did
you
ever
see
such
an
ungainly
creature
i
do
believe
it
has
shoe
buttons
for
eyes
and
yarn
hair
mercy
did
you
ever
see
such
feet
the
dutch
doll
rolled
off
the
doll
sofa
and
said
mamma
in
his
quavery
voice
he
was
so
surprised
at
hearing
anyone
speak
so
of
beloved
raggedy
ann
dear
raggedy
ann
she
of
the
candy
heart
whom
all
the
dolls
loved
uncle
clem
was
also
very
much
surprised
and
offended
he
walked
up
in
front
of
the
two
new
dolls
and
looked
them
sternly
in
the
eyes
but
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
so
he
pulled
at
his
yarn
mustache
marcella
had
only
received
the
two
new
dolls
that
morning
they
had
come
in
the
morning
mail
and
were
presents
from
an
aunt
marcella
had
named
the
two
new
dolls
and
thomas
after
her
aunt
and
uncle
and
thomas
were
beautiful
dolls
and
must
have
cost
heaps
and
heaps
of
shiny
pennies
for
both
were
handsomely
dressed
and
had
hair
annabel
hair
was
of
a
lovely
shade
of
auburn
and
thomas
was
golden
yellow
annabel
was
dressed
in
soft
silk
and
upon
her
head
she
wore
a
beautiful
hat
with
long
silk
ribbons
tied
in
a
neat
beneath
her
dimpled
chin
thomas
was
dressed
in
an
oliver
twist
suit
of
dark
velvet
with
a
lace
collar
both
he
and
annabel
wore
lovely
black
slippers
and
short
stockings
they
were
sitting
upon
two
of
the
little
red
doll
chairs
where
marcella
had
placed
them
and
where
they
could
see
the
other
dolls
when
uncle
clem
walked
in
front
of
them
and
pulled
his
mustache
they
laughed
outright
they
snickered
he
has
holes
in
his
knees
quite
true
uncle
clem
was
made
of
worsted
and
the
moths
had
eaten
his
knees
and
part
of
his
kiltie
he
had
a
kiltie
you
see
for
uncle
clem
was
a
scotch
doll
uncle
clem
shook
but
he
felt
so
hurt
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
he
walked
over
and
sat
down
beside
raggedy
ann
and
brushed
her
yarn
hair
away
from
her
eye
the
tin
soldier
went
over
and
sat
beside
them
do
you
mind
what
they
say
raggedy
he
said
they
do
not
know
you
as
we
do
we
do
care
to
know
her
said
as
she
primped
her
dress
she
looks
like
a
scarecrow
and
the
soldier
must
have
been
made
with
a
can
opener
laughed
thomas
illustration
illustration
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
said
the
french
dolly
as
she
stood
before
annabel
and
thomas
you
will
make
all
of
us
sorry
that
you
have
joined
our
family
if
you
continue
to
poke
fun
at
us
and
look
down
upon
us
we
are
all
happy
here
together
and
share
in
each
adventures
and
happiness
now
that
night
marcella
did
not
undress
the
two
new
dolls
for
she
had
no
nighties
for
them
so
she
let
them
sit
up
in
the
two
little
red
doll
chairs
so
they
would
not
muss
their
clothes
i
will
make
nighties
for
you
tomorrow
she
said
as
she
kissed
them
good
night
then
she
went
over
and
gave
raggedy
ann
a
good
night
hug
take
good
care
of
all
my
children
raggedy
she
said
as
she
went
out
annabel
and
thomas
whispered
together
perhaps
we
have
been
too
hasty
in
our
judgment
said
this
raggedy
ann
seems
to
be
a
favorite
with
the
mistress
and
with
all
the
dolls
there
must
be
a
reason
replied
thomas
i
am
beginning
to
feel
sorry
that
we
spoke
of
her
looks
one
really
can
not
help
one
looks
after
all
now
and
thomas
were
very
tired
after
their
long
journey
and
soon
they
fell
asleep
and
forgot
all
about
the
other
dolls
when
they
were
sound
asleep
raggedy
ann
slipped
quietly
from
her
bed
and
awakened
the
tin
soldier
and
uncle
clem
and
the
three
tiptoed
to
the
two
beautiful
new
dolls
they
lifted
them
gently
so
as
not
to
awaken
them
and
carried
them
to
raggedy
ann
bed
raggedy
ann
tucked
them
in
snugly
and
lay
down
upon
the
hard
floor
the
tin
soldier
and
uncle
clem
both
tried
to
coax
raggedy
ann
into
accepting
their
bed
they
slept
together
but
raggedy
ann
would
not
hear
of
it
i
am
stuffed
with
nice
soft
cotton
and
the
hard
floor
does
not
bother
me
at
all
said
raggedy
illustration
at
daybreak
the
next
morning
annabel
and
thomas
awakened
to
find
themselves
in
raggedy
ann
bed
and
as
they
raised
up
and
looked
at
each
other
each
knew
how
ashamed
the
other
felt
for
they
knew
raggedy
ann
had
generously
given
them
her
bed
there
raggedy
ann
lay
all
sprawled
out
upon
the
hard
floor
her
rag
arms
and
legs
twisted
in
ungraceful
attitudes
how
good
and
honest
she
looks
said
annabel
it
must
be
her
eyes
how
nicely
her
yarn
hair
falls
in
loops
over
her
face
exclaimed
thomas
i
did
not
notice
how
pleasant
her
face
looked
last
night
the
others
seem
to
love
her
ever
and
ever
so
much
mused
annabel
it
must
be
because
she
is
so
kind
both
new
dolls
were
silent
for
a
while
thinking
deeply
how
do
you
feel
thomas
finally
asked
very
much
ashamed
of
myself
answered
annabel
and
you
thomas
as
soon
as
raggedy
ann
awakens
i
shall
tell
her
just
how
much
ashamed
i
am
of
myself
and
if
she
can
i
want
her
to
forgive
me
thomas
said
the
more
i
look
at
her
the
better
i
like
her
said
annabel
i
am
going
to
kiss
her
said
thomas
you
awaken
her
if
you
do
said
annabel
but
thomas
climbed
out
of
bed
and
kissed
raggedy
ann
on
her
painted
cheek
and
smoothed
her
yarn
hair
from
her
rag
forehead
and
climbed
out
of
bed
too
and
kissed
raggedy
ann
then
thomas
and
gently
carried
raggedy
ann
and
put
her
in
her
own
bed
and
tenderly
tucked
her
in
and
then
took
their
seats
in
the
two
little
red
chairs
after
a
while
annabel
said
softly
to
thomas
i
feel
ever
and
ever
so
much
better
and
happier
illustration
so
do
i
thomas
replied
it
like
a
whole
lot
of
sunshine
coming
into
a
dark
room
and
i
shall
always
try
to
keep
it
there
fido
had
one
fuzzy
white
ear
sticking
up
over
the
edge
of
his
basket
and
he
gave
his
tail
a
few
thumps
against
his
pillow
raggedy
ann
lay
quietly
in
bed
where
thomas
and
annabel
had
tucked
her
and
as
she
smiled
at
the
ceiling
her
candy
heart
with
i
love
you
written
on
it
thrilled
with
contentment
for
as
you
have
probably
guessed
raggedy
ann
had
not
been
asleep
at
all
illustration
illustration
raggedy
ann
and
the
kittens
raggedy
ann
had
been
away
all
day
marcella
had
come
early
in
the
morning
and
dressed
all
the
dolls
and
placed
them
about
the
nursery
some
of
the
dolls
had
been
put
in
the
little
red
chairs
around
the
little
doll
table
there
was
nothing
to
eat
upon
the
table
except
a
turkey
a
fried
egg
and
an
apple
all
made
of
plaster
of
paris
and
painted
in
natural
colors
the
little
teapot
and
other
doll
dishes
were
empty
but
marcella
had
told
them
to
enjoy
their
dinner
while
she
was
away
the
french
dolly
had
been
given
a
seat
upon
the
doll
sofa
and
uncle
clem
had
been
placed
at
the
piano
marcella
picked
up
raggedy
ann
and
carried
her
out
of
the
nursery
when
she
left
telling
the
dolls
to
be
real
good
children
while
mamma
is
away
when
the
door
closed
the
tin
soldier
winked
at
the
doll
and
handed
the
imitation
turkey
to
the
penny
dolls
have
some
nice
turkey
he
asked
no
thank
you
the
penny
dolls
said
in
little
squeaky
voices
we
have
had
all
we
can
eat
shall
i
play
you
a
tune
asked
uncle
clem
of
the
french
doll
at
this
all
the
dolls
laughed
for
uncle
clem
could
not
begin
to
play
any
tune
raggedy
ann
was
the
only
doll
who
had
ever
taken
lessons
and
she
could
play
with
one
hand
in
fact
marcella
had
almost
worn
out
raggedy
ann
right
hand
teaching
it
to
her
play
something
lively
said
the
french
doll
as
she
giggled
behind
her
hand
so
uncle
clem
began
hammering
the
eight
keys
on
the
toy
piano
with
all
his
might
until
a
noise
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
quick
as
a
wink
all
the
dolls
took
the
same
positions
in
which
they
had
been
placed
by
marcella
for
they
did
not
wish
really
truly
people
to
know
that
they
could
move
about
but
it
was
only
fido
he
put
his
nose
in
the
door
and
looked
around
all
the
dolls
at
the
table
looked
steadily
at
the
painted
food
and
uncle
clem
leaned
upon
the
piano
keys
looking
just
as
unconcerned
as
when
he
had
been
placed
there
then
fido
pushed
the
door
open
and
came
into
the
nursery
wagging
his
tail
he
walked
over
to
the
table
and
sniffed
in
hopes
marcella
had
given
the
dolls
real
food
and
that
some
would
still
be
left
where
raggedy
ann
fido
asked
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
no
food
mistress
took
raggedy
ann
and
went
somewhere
all
the
dolls
answered
in
chorus
i
found
something
i
must
tell
raggedy
ann
about
said
fido
as
he
scratched
his
ear
is
it
a
secret
asked
the
penny
dolls
secret
nothing
replied
fido
it
kittens
how
lovely
cried
all
the
dolls
really
live
kittens
really
live
kittens
replied
fido
three
little
tiny
ones
out
in
the
barn
oh
i
wish
raggedy
ann
was
here
cried
the
french
doll
she
would
know
what
to
do
about
it
illustration
that
why
i
wanted
to
see
her
said
fido
as
he
thumped
his
tail
on
the
floor
i
did
not
know
there
were
any
kittens
and
i
went
into
the
barn
to
hunt
for
mice
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
mamma
cat
came
bouncing
right
at
me
with
her
eyes
looking
green
i
tell
you
i
hurried
out
of
there
illustration
how
did
you
know
there
were
any
kittens
then
asked
uncle
clem
i
waited
around
the
barn
until
mamma
cat
went
up
to
the
house
and
then
i
slipped
into
the
barn
again
for
i
knew
there
must
be
something
inside
or
she
would
not
have
jumped
at
me
that
way
we
are
always
very
friendly
you
know
fido
continued
and
what
was
my
surprise
to
find
three
tiny
little
kittens
in
an
old
basket
back
in
a
dark
corner
go
get
them
fido
and
bring
them
up
so
we
can
see
them
said
the
tin
soldier
not
me
said
fido
if
i
had
a
suit
of
tin
clothes
on
like
you
have
i
might
do
it
but
you
know
cats
can
scratch
very
hard
if
they
want
to
we
will
tell
raggedy
when
she
comes
in
said
the
french
doll
and
then
fido
went
out
to
play
with
a
neighbor
dog
so
when
raggedy
ann
had
been
returned
to
the
nursery
the
dolls
could
hardly
wait
until
marcella
had
put
on
their
nighties
and
left
them
for
the
night
then
they
told
raggedy
ann
all
about
the
kittens
raggedy
ann
jumped
from
her
bed
and
ran
over
to
fido
basket
he
there
then
raggedy
suggested
that
all
the
dolls
go
out
to
the
barn
and
see
the
kittens
this
they
did
easily
for
the
window
was
open
and
it
was
but
a
short
jump
to
the
ground
they
found
fido
out
near
the
barn
watching
a
hole
i
was
afraid
something
might
disturb
them
he
said
for
mamma
cat
went
away
about
an
hour
ago
all
the
dolls
with
raggedy
ann
in
the
lead
crawled
through
the
hole
and
ran
to
the
basket
illustration
just
as
raggedy
ann
started
to
pick
up
one
of
the
kittens
there
was
a
lot
of
howling
and
yelping
and
fido
came
bounding
through
the
hole
with
mamma
cat
behind
him
when
mamma
cat
caught
up
with
fido
he
would
yelp
when
fido
and
mamma
cat
had
circled
the
barn
two
or
three
times
fido
managed
to
find
the
hole
and
escape
to
the
yard
then
mamma
cat
came
over
to
the
basket
and
saw
all
the
dolls
i
at
you
mamma
cat
said
raggedy
ann
fido
has
been
watching
your
kittens
for
an
hour
while
you
were
away
he
would
hurt
them
for
anything
i
sorry
then
said
mamma
cat
you
must
trust
fido
mamma
cat
said
raggedy
ann
because
he
loves
you
and
anyone
who
loves
you
can
be
trusted
that
so
replied
mamma
cat
cats
love
mice
too
and
i
wish
the
mice
trusted
us
more
the
dolls
all
laughed
at
this
joke
have
you
told
the
folks
up
at
the
house
about
your
dear
little
kittens
raggedy
ann
asked
oh
my
no
exclaimed
mamma
cat
at
the
last
place
i
lived
the
people
found
out
about
my
kittens
and
do
you
know
all
the
kittens
disappeared
i
intend
keeping
this
a
secret
but
all
the
folks
at
this
house
are
very
kindly
people
and
would
dearly
love
your
kittens
cried
all
the
dolls
let
take
them
right
up
to
the
nursery
said
raggedy
ann
and
mistress
can
find
them
there
in
the
morning
how
lovely
said
all
the
dolls
in
chorus
do
mamma
cat
raggedy
ann
knows
for
she
is
stuffed
with
nice
clean
white
cotton
and
is
very
wise
so
after
a
great
deal
of
persuasion
mamma
cat
finally
consented
raggedy
ann
took
two
of
the
kittens
and
carried
them
to
the
house
while
mamma
cat
carried
the
other
raggedy
ann
wanted
to
give
the
kittens
her
bed
but
fido
who
was
anxious
to
prove
his
affection
insisted
that
mamma
cat
and
the
kittens
should
have
his
nice
soft
basket
illustration
the
dolls
could
hardly
sleep
that
night
they
were
so
anxious
to
see
what
mistress
would
say
when
she
found
the
dear
little
kittens
in
the
morning
raggedy
ann
did
not
sleep
a
wink
for
she
shared
her
bed
with
fido
and
he
kept
her
awake
whispering
to
her
in
the
morning
when
marcella
came
to
the
nursery
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
the
three
little
kittens
she
cried
out
in
delight
and
carried
them
all
down
to
show
to
mamma
and
daddy
mamma
cat
went
trailing
along
arching
her
back
and
purring
with
pride
as
she
rubbed
against
all
the
chairs
and
doors
mamma
and
daddy
said
the
kittens
could
stay
in
the
nursery
and
belong
to
marcella
so
marcella
took
them
back
to
fido
basket
while
she
hunted
names
for
them
out
of
a
fairy
tale
book
marcella
finally
decided
upon
three
names
prince
charming
for
the
white
kitty
cinderella
for
the
maltese
and
princess
golden
for
the
kitty
with
the
yellow
stripes
so
that
is
how
the
three
little
kittens
came
to
live
in
the
nursery
and
it
all
turned
out
just
as
raggedy
ann
had
said
for
her
head
was
stuffed
with
clean
white
cotton
and
she
could
think
exceedingly
wise
thoughts
and
mamma
cat
found
out
that
fido
was
a
very
good
friend
too
she
grew
to
trust
him
so
much
she
would
even
let
him
help
wash
the
kittens
faces

raggedy
ann
and
the
fairies
gift
all
the
dolls
were
tucked
snugly
in
their
little
for
the
night
and
the
large
house
was
very
still
every
once
in
a
while
fido
would
raise
one
ear
and
partly
open
one
eye
for
his
keen
dog
sense
seemed
to
tell
him
that
something
was
about
to
happen
finally
he
opened
both
eyes
sniffed
into
the
air
and
getting
out
of
his
basket
and
shaking
himself
he
trotted
across
the
nursery
to
raggedy
ann
bed
fido
put
his
cold
nose
in
raggedy
ann
neck
she
raised
her
head
from
the
little
pillow
oh
it
you
fido
said
raggedy
ann
i
dreamed
the
tin
soldier
put
an
icicle
down
my
neck
i
ca
sleep
fido
told
raggedy
ann
i
feel
that
something
is
about
to
happen
you
have
been
eating
too
many
bones
lately
fido
and
they
keep
you
awake
raggedy
replied
no
it
is
that
i
have
had
any
bones
since
the
folks
had
beef
last
sunday
it
is
that
listen
raggedy
raggedy
ann
listened
there
was
a
murmur
as
if
someone
were
singing
far
away
what
is
it
asked
fido
sh
cautioned
raggedy
ann
it
music
it
was
indeed
music
the
most
beautiful
music
raggedy
ann
had
ever
heard
it
grew
louder
but
still
seemed
to
be
away
raggedy
ann
and
fido
could
hear
it
distinctly
and
it
sounded
as
if
hundreds
of
voices
were
singing
in
unison
please
do
howl
fido
raggedy
ann
said
as
she
put
her
two
rag
arms
around
the
dog
nose
fido
usually
sang
when
he
heard
music
but
fido
did
not
sing
this
time
he
was
filled
with
wonder
it
seemed
as
if
something
very
nice
was
going
to
happen
raggedy
ann
sat
upright
in
bed
the
room
was
flooded
with
a
strange
beautiful
light
and
the
music
came
floating
in
through
the
nursery
window
raggedy
ann
hopped
from
her
bed
and
ran
across
the
floor
trailing
the
bed
clothes
behind
her
fido
followed
close
behind
and
together
they
looked
out
the
window
across
the
flower
garden
there
among
the
flowers
were
hundreds
of
tiny
beings
some
playing
on
tiny
reed
instruments
and
flower
horns
while
others
sang
this
was
the
strange
wonderful
music
raggedy
and
fido
had
heard
it
the
fairies
said
raggedy
ann
to
your
basket
quick
fido
they
are
coming
this
way
and
raggedy
ann
ran
back
to
her
bed
with
the
bed
clothes
trailing
behind
her
fido
gave
three
jumps
and
he
was
in
his
basket
pretending
he
was
sound
asleep
but
one
little
black
eye
was
peeping
through
a
chink
in
the
side
raggedy
jumped
into
her
bed
and
pulled
the
covers
to
her
chin
but
lay
so
that
her
eyes
could
see
towards
the
window
illustration
little
fairy
forms
radiant
as
silver
came
flitting
into
the
nursery
singing
in
far
away
voices
they
carried
a
little
bundle
a
beautiful
light
came
from
this
bundle
and
to
raggedy
ann
and
fido
it
seemed
like
sunshine
and
moonshine
mixed
it
was
a
soft
mellow
light
just
the
sort
of
light
you
would
expect
to
accompany
fairy
folk
illustration
as
raggedy
watched
her
candy
heart
went
against
her
cotton
stuffing
for
she
saw
a
tiny
pink
foot
sticking
out
of
the
bundle
of
light
the
fairy
troop
sailed
across
the
nursery
and
through
the
door
with
their
bundle
and
raggedy
ann
and
fido
listened
to
their
far
away
music
as
they
went
down
the
hall
presently
the
fairies
returned
without
the
bundle
and
disappeared
through
the
nursery
window
raggedy
ann
and
fido
again
ran
to
the
window
and
saw
the
fairy
troop
dancing
among
the
flowers
the
light
from
the
bundle
still
hung
about
the
nursery
and
a
strange
lovely
perfume
floated
about
when
the
fairies
music
ceased
and
they
had
flown
away
raggedy
ann
and
fido
returned
to
raggedy
bed
to
think
it
all
out
when
old
mister
sun
peeped
over
the
garden
wall
and
into
the
nursery
and
the
other
dolls
awakened
raggedy
ann
and
fido
were
still
puzzled
what
is
it
raggedy
ann
asked
the
tin
soldier
and
uncle
clem
in
one
voice
before
raggedy
ann
could
answer
marcella
came
running
into
the
nursery
gathered
up
all
the
dolls
in
her
arms
and
ran
down
the
hall
fido
jumping
beside
her
and
barking
shrilly
be
quiet
marcella
said
to
fido
it
asleep
and
you
might
awaken
it
mamma
helped
marcella
arrange
all
the
dolls
in
a
circle
around
the
bed
so
that
they
could
all
see
what
was
in
the
bundle
mamma
gently
pulled
back
the
soft
covering
and
the
dolls
saw
a
tiny
little
fist
as
pink
as
coral
a
soft
little
face
with
a
cunning
tiny
pink
nose
and
a
little
head
as
bald
as
the
french
dolly
when
her
hair
came
off
my
how
the
dollies
all
chattered
when
they
were
once
again
left
alone
in
the
nursery

love
and
fairy
sunshine
for
everybody
in

house

raggedy

as
she
went
to
the
toy
piano
and
joyously
played
with
one
rag
hand
illustration
illustration
raggedy
ann
and
the
chickens
when
marcella
was
called
into
the
house
she
left
raggedy
sitting
on
the
chicken
yard
fence
now
you
sit
quietly
and
do
not
stir
marcella
told
raggedy
ann
if
you
move
you
may
fall
and
hurt
yourself
so
raggedy
ann
sat
quietly
just
as
marcella
told
her
but
she
smiled
at
the
chickens
for
she
had
fallen
time
and
again
and
it
had
never
hurt
her
in
the
least
she
was
stuffed
with
nice
soft
cotton
you
see
so
there
she
sat
until
a
tiny
little
in
search
of
flower
honey
hummed
close
to
raggedy
ann
head
and
hovered
near
the
tall
hollyhocks
raggedy
ann
turned
her
rag
head
to
see
the
and
lost
her
balance
she
went
down
amongst
the
chickens
the
chickens
scattered
in
all
directions
all
except
old
ironsides
the
rooster
he
ruffled
his
neck
feathers
and
put
his
head
down
close
to
the
ground
making
a
queer
whistling
noise
as
he
looked
fiercely
at
raggedy
ann
but
raggedy
ann
only
smiled
at
old
ironsides
the
rooster
and
ran
her
rag
hand
through
her
yarn
hair
for
she
did
not
fear
him
and
then
something
strange
happened
for
when
she
made
this
motion
the
old
rooster
jumped
up
in
the
air
and
kicked
his
feet
out
in
front
knocking
raggedy
ann
over
and
over
when
raggedy
ann
stopped
rolling
she
waved
her
apron
at
the
rooster
and
cried
shoo
but
instead
of
shooing
old
ironsides
upset
her
again
now
two
old
hens
who
had
been
watching
the
rooster
jump
at
raggedy
ran
up
and
as
one
old
hen
placed
herself
before
the
rooster
the
other
old
hen
caught
hold
of
raggedy
apron
and
dragged
her
into
the
it
was
dark
inside
and
raggedy
could
not
tell
what
was
going
on
as
she
felt
herself
being
pulled
up
over
the
nests
but
finally
raggedy
could
sit
up
for
the
old
hen
had
quit
pulling
her
and
as
her
eyes
were
very
good
she
soon
made
out
the
shape
of
the
old
hen
in
front
of
her
my
that
the
hardest
work
i
have
done
in
a
long
time
said
the
old
hen
when
she
could
catch
her
breath
i
was
afraid
rooster
would
tear
your
dress
and
apron
that
was
a
queer
game
he
was
playing
hen
said
raggedy
ann
the
old
hen
chuckled
down
in
her
throat
gracious
me
he
playing
a
game
he
was
fighting
you
fighting
cried
raggedy
ann
in
surprise
oh
yes
indeed
the
old
hen
answered
old
ironsides
the
rooster
thought
you
intended
to
harm
some
of
the
children
chickens
and
he
was
fighting
you
i
am
sorry
that
i
fell
inside
the
pen
i
would
harm
anything
raggedy
ann
said
if
we
tell
you
a
secret
you
must
promise
not
to
tell
your
mistress
said
the
old
hens
i
promise
cross
my
candy
heart
said
raggedy
ann
then
the
two
old
hens
took
raggedy
ann
back
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
chicken
coop
there
in
back
of
a
box
they
had
built
two
nests
and
each
old
hen
had
ten
eggs
in
her
nest
if
your
folks
hear
of
it
they
will
take
the
eggs
said
the
hens
and
then
we
could
not
raise
our
families
illustration
illustration
raggedy
ann
felt
the
eggs
and
they
were
nice
and
warm
we
just
left
the
nests
when
you
fell
into
the
pen
explained
the
old
hens
but
how
can
the
eggs
grow
if
you
sit
upon
them
said
raggedy
if
fido
sits
on
any
of
the
garden
the
plants
will
not
grow
mistress
says
eggs
are
different
one
old
hen
explained
in
order
to
make
the
eggs
hatch
properly
we
must
sit
on
them
three
weeks
and
not
let
them
get
cold
at
any
time
and
at
the
end
of
the
three
weeks
do
the
eggs
sprout
asked
raggedy
ann
you
must
be
thinking
of
eggplant
cried
one
old
hen
these
eggs
hatch
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
they
do
sprout
and
then
we
have
a
lovely
family
of
soft
downy
chickies
little
puff
balls
that
we
can
cuddle
under
our
wings
and
love
dearly
have
you
been
sitting
upon
the
eggs
very
long
raggedy
asked
neither
one
of
us
has
kept
track
of
the
time
said
one
hen
so
we
do
not
know
you
see
we
never
leave
the
nests
only
just
once
in
a
while
to
get
a
drink
and
to
eat
a
little
so
we
can
hardly
tell
when
it
is
day
and
when
it
is
night
we
were
going
out
to
get
a
drink
when
you
fell
in
the
pen
said
one
old
hen
now
we
will
have
to
sit
upon
the
eggs
and
warm
them
up
again
the
two
old
hens
spread
their
feathers
and
nestled
down
upon
the
nests
when
you
get
them
good
and
warm
i
would
be
glad
to
sit
upon
the
eggs
to
keep
them
warm
until
you
get
something
to
eat
and
drink
said
raggedy
so
the
two
old
hens
walked
out
of
the
coop
to
finish
their
meal
which
had
been
interrupted
by
raggedy
fall
and
while
they
were
gone
raggedy
ann
sat
quietly
upon
the
warm
eggs
suddenly
down
beneath
her
she
heard
something
go
pick
pick
i
hope
it
is
a
mouse
raggedy
ann
said
to
herself
when
she
felt
something
move
i
wish
the
old
hens
would
come
back
but
when
they
came
back
and
saw
the
puzzled
expression
on
her
face
they
cried
what
is
it
illustration
raggedy
ann
got
to
her
feet
and
looked
down
and
there
were
several
little
fluffy
cuddly
baby
chickies
round
as
little
cheep
cheep
cheep
they
cried
when
raggedy
stepped
out
of
the
nest
baby
chicks
raggedy
cried
as
she
stooped
and
picked
up
one
of
the
little
they
want
to
be
cuddled
the
two
old
hens
their
eyes
shining
with
happiness
got
upon
the
nests
and
spread
out
their
soft
warm
feathers
the
other
eggs
will
hatch
soon
said
they
so
for
several
days
raggedy
helped
the
two
hens
hatch
out
the
rest
of
the
chickies
and
just
as
they
finished
marcella
came
inside
looking
around
how
in
the
world
did
you
get
in
here
raggedy
ann
she
cried
i
have
been
looking
all
about
for
you
did
the
chickens
drag
you
in
here
both
old
hens
down
behind
the
box
clucked
softly
to
the
chickies
beneath
them
and
marcella
overheard
them
she
lifted
the
box
away
and
gave
a
little
squeal
of
surprise
and
happiness
oh
you
dear
old
hennypennies
she
cried
lifting
both
old
hens
from
their
nests
you
have
hidden
your
nests
away
back
here
and
now
you
have
one
two
three
four
twenty
chickies
and
as
she
counted
them
marcella
placed
them
in
her
apron
then
catching
up
raggedy
ann
she
placed
her
over
the
new
little
chickies
come
on
old
hennypennies
she
said
and
went
out
of
the
coop
with
the
two
old
hens
clucking
at
her
heels
marcella
called
daddy
and
daddy
rolled
two
barrels
out
under
one
of
the
trees
and
made
a
nice
bed
in
each
then
he
nailed
slats
across
the
front
leaving
a
place
for
a
door
each
hennypennie
was
then
given
ten
little
chickies
and
shut
up
in
the
barrel
and
all
the
dolls
were
happy
when
they
heard
of
raggedy
adventure
and
they
did
not
have
to
wait
long
before
they
were
all
taken
out
to
see
the
new
chickies
illustration
raggedy
ann
and
the
mouse
jeanette
was
a
new
wax
doll
and
like
henny
the
dutch
doll
she
could
say
mamma
when
anyone
tipped
her
backward
or
forward
she
had
lovely
golden
brown
curls
of
real
hair
it
could
be
combed
and
braided
or
curled
or
fluffed
without
tangling
and
raggedy
ann
was
very
proud
when
jeanette
came
to
live
with
the
dolls
but
now
raggedy
ann
was
very
angry
in
fact
raggedy
ann
had
just
ripped
two
stitches
out
of
the
top
of
her
head
when
she
took
her
rag
hands
and
pulled
her
rag
face
down
into
a
frown
but
when
she
let
go
of
the
frown
her
face
stretched
right
back
into
her
usual
cheery
smile
and
would
have
been
angry
too
for
something
had
happened
to
jeanette
something
or
someone
had
stolen
into
the
nursery
that
night
when
the
dolls
were
asleep
and
nibbled
all
the
wax
from
jeanette
beautiful
face
and
now
all
her
beauty
was
gone
it
really
is
a
shame
said
raggedy
ann
as
she
put
her
arms
about
jeanette
something
must
be
done
about
it
said
the
french
doll
as
she
stamped
her
little
foot
if
i
catch
the
culprit
i
will
well
i
do
know
what
i
will
do
with
him
said
the
tin
soldier
who
could
be
very
fierce
at
times
although
he
was
seldom
cross
here
is
the
hole
he
came
from
cried
uncle
clem
from
the
other
end
of
the
nursery
come
see
all
the
dolls
ran
to
where
uncle
clem
was
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
this
must
be
the
place
said
raggedy
ann
we
will
plug
up
the
hole
with
something
so
he
will
not
come
out
again
the
dolls
hunted
around
and
brought
rags
and
pieces
of
paper
and
pushed
them
into
the
mouse
doorway
i
thought
i
heard
nibbling
last
night
one
of
the
penny
dolls
said
you
know
i
begged
for
an
extra
piece
of
pie
last
evening
when
mistress
had
me
at
the
table
and
it
kept
me
awake
while
the
dolls
were
talking
marcella
ran
with
jeanette
and
told
daddy
and
mamma
who
came
with
marcella
and
hunted
around
until
they
discovered
the
mouse
doorway
oh
why
could
it
have
chewed
on
me
raggedy
ann
asked
herself
when
she
saw
marcella
sorrowful
face
for
raggedy
ann
was
never
selfish
daddy
will
take
jeanette
with
him
and
have
her
fixed
up
as
good
as
new
said
mamma
so
jeanette
was
wrapped
in
soft
tissue
paper
and
taken
away
later
in
the
day
marcella
came
bouncing
into
the
nursery
with
a
surprise
for
the
dolls
it
was
a
dear
fuzzy
little
kitten
marcella
introduced
the
kitten
to
all
the
dolls
her
name
is
boots
because
she
has
four
little
white
feet
said
marcella
so
boots
the
happy
little
creature
played
with
the
penny
dolls
scraping
them
over
the
floor
and
peeping
out
from
behind
chairs
and
pouncing
upon
them
as
if
they
were
mice
and
the
penny
dolls
enjoyed
it
hugely
when
marcella
was
not
in
the
nursery
raggedy
ann
wrestled
with
boots
and
they
would
roll
over
and
over
upon
the
floor
boots
with
her
front
feet
around
raggedy
ann
neck
and
kicking
with
her
hind
feet
illustration
then
boots
would
arch
her
back
and
pretend
she
was
very
angry
and
walk
sideways
until
she
was
close
to
raggedy
then
she
would
jump
at
her
and
over
and
over
they
would
roll
their
heads
hitting
the
floor
boots
slept
in
the
nursery
that
night
and
was
lonely
for
her
mamma
for
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
away
from
home
even
though
her
bed
was
right
on
top
of
raggedy
ann
she
could
not
sleep
but
raggedy
ann
was
very
glad
to
have
boots
sleep
with
her
even
if
she
was
heavy
and
when
boots
began
crying
for
her
mamma
raggedy
ann
comforted
her
and
soon
boots
went
to
sleep
one
day
jeanette
came
home
she
had
a
new
coating
of
wax
on
her
face
and
she
was
as
beautiful
as
ever
now
by
this
time
boots
was
one
of
the
family
and
did
not
cry
at
night
besides
boots
was
told
of
the
mouse
in
the
corner
and
how
he
had
eaten
jeanette
wax
so
she
promised
to
sleep
with
one
eye
open
late
that
night
when
boots
was
the
only
one
awake
out
popped
a
tiny
mouse
from
the
hole
boots
jumped
after
the
mouse
and
hit
against
the
toy
piano
and
made
the
keys
tinkle
so
loudly
it
awakened
the
dolls
they
ran
over
to
where
boots
sat
growling
with
the
tiny
mouse
in
her
mouth
my
how
the
mouse
was
squeaking
raggedy
ann
did
not
like
to
hear
it
squeak
but
she
did
not
wish
jeanette
to
have
her
wax
face
chewed
again
either
so
raggedy
ann
said
to
the
tiny
little
mouse
you
should
have
known
better
than
to
come
here
when
boots
is
with
us
why
do
you
go
out
in
the
barn
and
live
where
you
will
not
destroy
anything
of
value
i
did
not
know
squeaked
the
little
mouse
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
been
here
are
you
the
little
mouse
who
nibbled
jeanette
wax
face
raggedy
ann
asked
no
the
little
mouse
answered
i
was
visiting
the
mice
inside
the
walls
and
wandered
out
here
to
pick
up
cake
crumbs
i
have
three
little
baby
mice
at
home
down
in
the
barn
i
have
never
nibbled
at
anyone
wax
face
are
you
a
mamma
mouse
uncle
clem
asked
yes
the
little
mouse
squeaked
and
if
the
kitten
will
let
me
go
i
will
run
right
home
to
my
children
and
never
return
again
let
her
go
boots
the
dolls
all
cried
she
has
three
little
baby
mice
at
home
please
let
her
go
no
sir
boots
growled
this
is
the
first
mouse
i
have
ever
caught
and
i
will
eat
her
at
this
the
little
mamma
mouse
began
squeaking
louder
than
ever
if
you
do
not
let
the
mamma
mouse
go
boots
i
shall
not
play
with
you
again
said
raggedy
ann
raggedy
will
not
play
with
boots
again
said
all
of
the
dolls
in
an
awed
tone
not
to
have
raggedy
play
with
them
would
have
been
sad
indeed
but
boots
only
growled
the
dolls
drew
to
one
side
where
raggedy
ann
and
uncle
clem
whispered
together
and
while
they
whispered
boots
would
let
the
little
mamma
mouse
run
a
piece
then
she
would
catch
it
again
and
box
it
about
between
her
paws
this
she
did
until
the
poor
little
mamma
mouse
grew
so
tired
it
could
scarcely
run
away
from
boots
boots
would
let
it
get
almost
to
the
hole
in
the
wall
before
she
would
catch
it
for
she
knew
it
would
not
escape
her
as
she
watched
the
little
mouse
crawling
towards
the
hole
scarcely
able
to
move
raggedy
ann
could
not
keep
the
tears
from
her
eyes
finally
as
boots
started
to
spring
after
the
little
mouse
again
raggedy
ann
threw
her
rag
arms
around
the
kitten
neck
run
mamma
mouse
raggedy
ann
cried
as
boots
whirled
her
over
and
over
uncle
clem
ran
and
pushed
the
mamma
mouse
into
the
hole
and
then
she
was
gone
when
raggedy
ann
took
her
arms
from
around
boots
the
kitten
was
very
angry
she
laid
her
ears
back
and
scratched
raggedy
ann
with
her
claws
but
raggedy
ann
only
smiled
it
did
not
hurt
her
a
bit
for
raggedy
was
sewed
together
with
a
needle
and
thread
and
if
that
did
not
hurt
how
could
the
scratch
of
a
kitten
finally
boots
felt
ashamed
of
herself
and
went
over
and
lay
down
by
the
hole
in
the
wall
in
hopes
the
mouse
would
return
but
the
mouse
never
returned
even
then
mamma
mouse
was
out
in
the
barn
with
her
children
warning
them
to
beware
of
kittens
and
cats
raggedy
ann
and
all
the
dolls
then
went
to
bed
and
raggedy
had
just
dozed
off
to
sleep
when
she
felt
something
jump
upon
her
bed
it
was
boots
she
felt
a
warm
little
pink
tongue
caress
her
rag
cheek
raggedy
ann
smiled
happily
to
herself
for
boots
had
curled
up
on
top
of
raggedy
ann
and
was
purring
herself
to
sleep
then
raggedy
ann
knew
she
had
been
forgiven
for
rescuing
the
mamma
mouse
and
she
smiled
herself
to
sleep
and
dreamed
happily
of
tomorrow

raggedy
ann
new
sisters
marcella
was
having
a
tea
party
up
in
the
nursery
when
daddy
called
to
her
so
she
left
the
dollies
sitting
around
the
tiny
table
and
ran
down
stairs
carrying
raggedy
ann
with
her
mama
daddy
and
a
strange
man
were
talking
in
the
living
room
and
daddy
introduced
marcella
to
the
stranger
the
stranger
was
a
large
man
with
kindly
eyes
and
a
cheery
smile
as
pleasant
as
raggedy
ann
he
took
marcella
upon
his
knee
and
ran
his
fingers
through
her
curls
as
he
talked
to
daddy
and
mamma
so
of
course
raggedy
ann
liked
him
from
the
beginning
i
have
two
little
girls
he
told
marcella
their
names
are
virginia
and
doris
and
one
time
when
we
were
at
the
they
were
playing
in
the
sand
and
they
covered
up
freddy
doris
in
the
sand
they
were
playing
that
freddy
was
in
bathing
and
that
he
wanted
to
be
covered
with
the
clean
white
sand
just
as
the
other
bathers
did
and
when
they
had
covered
freddy
they
took
their
little
pails
and
shovels
and
went
farther
down
the
beach
to
play
and
forgot
all
about
freddy
now
when
it
came
time
for
us
to
go
home
virginia
and
doris
remembered
freddy
and
ran
down
to
get
him
but
the
tide
had
come
in
and
freddy
was
out
under
the
water
and
they
could
not
find
him
virginia
and
doris
were
very
sad
and
they
talked
of
freddy
all
the
way
home
it
was
too
bad
they
forgot
freddy
said
marcella
yes
indeed
it
was
the
new
friend
replied
as
he
took
raggedy
ann
up
and
made
her
dance
on
marcella
knee
but
it
turned
out
all
right
after
all
for
do
you
know
what
happened
to
freddy
no
what
did
happen
to
him
marcella
asked
well
first
of
all
when
freddy
was
covered
with
the
sand
he
enjoyed
it
immensely
and
he
did
not
mind
it
so
much
when
the
tide
came
up
over
him
for
he
felt
virginia
and
doris
would
return
and
get
him
but
presently
freddy
felt
the
sand
above
him
move
as
if
someone
was
digging
him
out
soon
his
head
was
uncovered
and
he
could
look
right
up
through
the
pretty
green
water
and
what
do
you
think
was
happening
the
tide
fairies
were
uncovering
freddy
when
he
was
completely
uncovered
the
tide
fairies
swam
with
freddy
out
to
the
undertow
fairies
the
undertow
fairies
took
freddy
and
swam
with
him
out
to
the
roller
fairies
the
roller
fairies
carried
freddy
up
to
the
surface
and
tossed
him
up
to
the
spray
fairies
who
carried
him
to
the
wind
fairies
and
the
wind
fairies
marcella
asked
breathlessly
the
wind
fairies
carried
freddy
right
to
our
garden
and
there
virginia
and
doris
found
him
none
the
worse
for
his
wonderful
adventure
freddy
must
have
enjoyed
it
and
your
little
girls
must
have
been
very
glad
to
get
freddy
back
again
said
marcella
raggedy
ann
went
up
in
the
air
on
the
tail
of
a
kite
one
day
and
fell
and
was
lost
so
now
i
am
very
careful
with
her
would
you
let
me
take
raggedy
ann
for
a
few
days
asked
the
new
friend
marcella
was
silent
she
liked
the
stranger
friend
but
she
did
not
wish
to
lose
raggedy
ann
illustration
i
will
promise
to
take
very
good
care
of
her
and
return
her
to
you
in
a
week
will
you
let
her
go
with
me
marcella
marcella
finally
agreed
and
when
the
stranger
friend
left
he
placed
raggedy
ann
in
his
grip
it
is
lonely
without
raggedy
ann
said
the
dollies
each
night
we
miss
her
happy
painted
smile
and
her
cheery
ways
they
said
and
so
the
week
dragged
by
but
my
what
a
chatter
there
was
in
the
nursery
the
first
night
after
raggedy
ann
returned
all
the
dolls
were
so
anxious
to
hug
raggedy
ann
they
could
scarcely
wait
until
marcella
had
left
them
alone
when
they
had
squeezed
raggedy
ann
almost
out
of
shape
and
she
had
smoothed
out
her
yarn
hair
patted
her
apron
out
and
felt
her
eyes
to
see
if
they
were
still
there
she
said
well
what
have
you
been
doing
tell
me
all
the
news
oh
we
have
just
had
the
usual
tea
parties
and
games
said
the
tin
soldier
tell
us
about
yourself
raggedy
dear
we
have
missed
you
so
much
yes
tell
us
where
you
have
been
and
what
you
have
done
raggedy
all
the
dolls
cried
but
raggedy
ann
just
then
noticed
that
one
of
the
penny
dolls
had
a
hand
missing
how
did
this
happen
she
asked
as
she
picked
up
the
doll
i
fell
off
the
table
and
lit
upon
the
tin
soldier
last
night
when
we
were
playing
but
do
mind
a
little
thing
like
that
raggedy
ann
replied
the
penny
doll
tell
us
of
yourself
have
you
had
a
nice
time
i
shall
not
tell
a
thing
until
your
hand
is
mended
raggedy
ann
said
so
the
indian
ran
and
brought
a
bottle
of
glue
where
the
hand
raggedy
asked
in
my
pocket
the
penny
doll
answered
illustration
when
raggedy
ann
had
glued
the
penny
doll
hand
in
place
and
wrapped
a
rag
around
it
to
hold
it
until
the
glue
dried
she
said
when
i
tell
you
of
this
wonderful
adventure
i
know
you
will
all
feel
very
happy
it
has
made
me
almost
burst
my
stitches
with
joy
the
dolls
all
sat
upon
the
floor
around
raggedy
ann
the
tin
soldier
with
his
arm
over
her
shoulder
well
first
when
i
left
said
raggedy
ann
i
was
placed
in
the
stranger
friend
grip
it
was
rather
stuffy
in
there
but
i
did
not
mind
it
in
fact
i
believe
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
for
when
i
awakened
i
saw
the
stranger
friend
hand
reaching
into
the
grip
then
he
lifted
me
from
the
grip
and
danced
me
upon
his
knee
do
you
think
of
her
he
asked
to
three
other
men
sitting
nearby
i
was
so
interested
in
looking
out
of
the
window
i
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
what
they
said
for
we
were
on
a
train
and
the
scenery
was
just
flying
by
then
i
was
put
back
in
the
grip
when
next
i
was
taken
from
the
grip
i
was
in
a
large
clean
light
room
and
there
were
many
many
girls
all
dressed
in
white
aprons
the
stranger
friend
showed
me
to
another
man
and
to
the
girls
who
took
off
my
clothes
cut
my
seams
and
took
out
my
cotton
and
what
do
you
think
they
found
my
lovely
candy
heart
had
not
melted
at
all
as
i
thought
then
they
laid
me
on
a
table
and
marked
all
around
my
outside
edges
with
a
pencil
on
clean
white
cloth
and
then
the
girls
me
and
dressed
me
i
stayed
in
the
clean
big
light
room
for
two
or
three
days
and
nights
and
watched
my
sisters
grow
from
pieces
of
cloth
into
rag
dolls
just
like
myself
your
sisters
the
dolls
all
exclaimed
in
astonishment
what
do
you
mean
raggedy
i
mean
said
raggedy
ann
that
the
stranger
friend
had
borrowed
me
from
marcella
so
that
he
could
have
patterns
made
from
me
and
before
i
left
the
big
clean
white
room
there
where
hundreds
of
rag
dolls
so
like
me
you
would
not
have
been
able
to
tell
us
apart
we
could
have
told
by
your
happy
smile
cried
the
french
dolly
but
all
of
my
sister
dolls
have
smiles
just
like
mine
replied
raggedy
ann
and
eyes
the
dolls
all
asked
yes
eyes
raggedy
ann
replied
i
would
tell
you
from
the
others
by
your
dress
raggedy
ann
said
the
french
doll
your
dress
is
fifty
years
old
i
could
tell
you
by
that
but
my
new
sister
rag
dolls
have
dresses
just
like
mine
for
the
stranger
friend
had
cloth
made
especially
for
them
exactly
like
mine
i
know
how
we
could
tell
you
from
the
other
rag
dolls
even
if
you
all
look
exactly
alike
said
the
indian
doll
who
had
been
thinking
for
a
long
time
how
asked
raggedy
ann
with
a
laugh
by
feeling
your
candy
heart
if
the
doll
has
a
candy
heart
then
it
is
you
raggedy
ann
raggedy
ann
laughed
i
am
so
glad
you
all
love
me
as
you
do
but
i
am
sure
you
would
not
be
able
to
tell
me
from
my
new
sisters
except
that
i
am
more
worn
for
each
new
rag
doll
has
a
candy
heart
and
on
it
is
written
love
just
as
is
written
on
my
own
candy
heart
and
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
the
new
rag
dolls
asked
the
little
penny
dolls
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
all
named
raggedy
ann
replied
raggedy
then
said
the
penny
dolls
we
are
indeed
happy
and
proud
for
you
for
wherever
one
of
the
new
raggedy
ann
dolls
goes
there
will
go
with
it
the
love
and
happiness
that
give
to
others
