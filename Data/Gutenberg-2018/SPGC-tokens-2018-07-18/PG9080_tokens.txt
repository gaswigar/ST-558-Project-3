laugh
laughed

blew

gale
from

the

fell
hissing
in
the

and
the
billows
frothed
like

down

answered

lashed
to

all
stiff
and
stark
with
his
face
turned
to
the
skies
the
lantern
gleamed
through
the
gleaming
snow
on
his
fixed
and
glassy
eyes
then
the
maiden
clasped
her
hands
and
prayed
that
saved
she
might
be
and
she
thought
of
christ
who
stilled
the
wave
on
the
lake
of
galilee

fast
through
the
midnight
dark

drear

swept
the

ever
the
fitful

sound
came
from

was
the
sound
of
the
trampling
surf
on

rocks

the
hard
the
breakers
were
right
beneath
her
bows
she
drifted
a
dreary
wreck

a
whooping
billow
swept
the
crew
like
icicles
from
her
deck
she
struck
where
the
white
and
fleecy
waves
looked
soft
as
carded
wool

the
cruel
rocks
they
gored
her
side
like
the
horns

angry
bull

rattling

that
grows
on

thorn
by

wayside

softly
they
gleamed
beneath

feed
in

sprinkled

as

with

hyssop
sprinkles
the
congregation

scatters
blessings
upon

passed
with

brought

a
celestial
brightness

ethereal
beauty

on

face

encircled
her
form

after

homeward

she

slope
of

with
iron

near
it

trough

horses

for

there
in

seraglio

the

turkey

when

completed

hurried
away

forge

the

at
the
door

stood
with
wondering
eyes
to
behold
him

in

lap

of
the
horse
as
a
plaything
nailing
the

in

place

seemed

warm
by

forge
within
they
watched
the
laboring
bellows
and
as
its
panting
ceased
and
the
sparks
expired
in
the
ashes
merrily
laughed
and
said
they
were
nuns
going
into
the
chapel
oft
on
sledges
in
winter
as
swift
as
the
swoop
of
the
eagle
down
the
hillside
bounding
they
glided
away
the
meadow
oft
in
the
barns
they
climbed
to
the
populous
nests
on
the
rafters
seeking
with
eager
eyes
that
wondrous
stone
which
the
swallow
brings
from
the
shore
of
the
sea
to
restore
the
sight
of
its
fledglings
lucky
was
he
who
found
that
stone
in
the
nest
of
the
swallow
thus
passed
a
few
swift
years
and
they
no
longer
were
children
he
was
a
valiant
youth
and
his
face
like
the
face
of
the
morning
gladdened
the
earth
with
its
light
and
ripened
thought
into
action
she
was
a
woman
now
with
the
heart
and
hopes
of
a
woman
sunshine
of
saint
eulalie
was
she
called
for
that
was
the
sunshine
which
as
the
farmers
believed
would
load
their
orchards
with
apples
she
too
would
bring
to
her
husband
house
delight
and
abundance
filling
it
with
love
and
the
ruddy
faces
of
children
ii
now
had
the
season
returned
when
the
nights
grow
colder
and
longer
and
the
retreating
sun
the
sign
of
the
scorpion
enters
birds
of
passage
sailed
through
the
leaden
air
from
the
desolate
northern
bays
to
the
shores
of
tropical
islands
harvests
were
gathered
in
and
wild
with
the
winds
of
september
wrestled
the
trees
of
the
forest
as
jacob
of
old
with
the
angel
all
the
signs
foretold
a
winter
long
and
inclement
bees
with
prophetic
instinct
of
want
had
hoarded
their
honey
till
the
hives
overflowed
and
the
indian
hunters
asserted
cold
would
the
winter
be
for
thick
was
the
fur
of
the
foxes
such
was
the
advent
of
autumn
then
followed
that
beautiful
season
called
by
the
pious
acadian
peasants
the
summer
of
filled
was
the
air
with
a
dreamy
and
magical
light
and
the
landscape
lay
as
if
in
all
the
freshness
of
childhood
peace
seemed
to
reign
upon
earth
and
the
restless
heart
of
the
ocean
was
for
a
moment
consoled
all
sounds
were
in
harmony
blended
voices
of
children
at
play
the
crowing
of
cocks
in
the
whir
of
wings
in
the
drowsy
air
and
the
cooing
of
pigeons
all
were
subdued
and
low
as
the
murmurs
of
love
and
the
great
sun
looked
with
the
eye
of
love
through
the
golden
vapors
around
him
while
arrayed
in
its
robes
of
russet
and
scarlet
and
yellow
bright
with
the
sheen
of
the
dew
each
glittering
tree
of
the
forest
flashed
like
the
the
persian
adorned
with
mantles
and
jewels
now
recommenced
the
reign
of
rest
and
affection
and
stillness
day
with
its
burden
and
heat
had
departed
and
twilight
descending
brought
back
the
evening
star
to
the
sky
and
the
herds
to
the
homestead
pawing
the
ground
they
came
and
resting
their
necks
on
each
other
and
with
their
nostrils
distended
inhaling
the
freshness
of
evening
foremost
bearing
the
bell
evangeline
beautiful
heifer
proud
of
her
hide
and
the
ribbon
that
waved
from
her
collar
quietly
paced
and
slow
as
if
conscious
of
human
affection
then
came
the
shepherd
back
with
his
bleating
flocks
from
the
seaside
where
was
their
favorite
pasture
behind
them
followed
the
patient
full
of
importance
and
grand
in
the
pride
of
his
instinct
walking
from
side
to
side
with
a
lordly
air
and
superbly
waving
his
bushy
tail
and
urging
forward
the
stragglers
regent
of
flocks
was
he
when
the
shepherd
slept
their
protector
when
from
the
forest
at
night
through
the
starry
silence
the
wolves
howled
late
with
the
rising
moon
returned
the
wains
from
the
marshes
laden
with
briny
hay
that
filled
the
air
with
its
odor
cheerily
neighed
the
steeds
with
dew
on
their
manes
and
their
fetlocks
while
aloft
on
their
shoulders
the
wooden
and
ponderous
saddles
painted
with
brilliant
dyes
and
adorned
with
tassels
of
crimson
nodded
in
bright
array
like
hollyhocks
heavy
with
blossoms
patiently
stood
the
cows
meanwhile
and
yielded
their
udders
unto
the
milkmaid
hand
whilst
loud
and
in
regular
cadence
into
the
sounding
pails
the
foaming
streamlets
descended
lowing
of
cattle
and
peals
of
laughter
were
heard
in
the
echoed
back
by
the
barns
anon
they
sank
into
stillness
heavily
closed
with
a
jarring
sound
the
valves
of
the
rattled
the
wooden
bars
and
all
for
a
season
was
silent
warm
by
the
fireplace
idly
the
farmer
sat
in
his
and
watched
how
the
flames
and
the
struggled
together
like
foes
in
a
burning
city
behind
him
nodding
and
mocking
along
the
wall
with
gestures
fantastic
darted
his
own
huge
shadow
and
vanished
away
into
darkness
faces
clumsily
carved
in
oak
on
the
back
of
his
laughed
in
the
flickering
light
and
the
pewter
plates
on
the
dresser
caught
and
reflected
the
flame
as
shields
of
armies
the
sunshine
fragments
of
song
the
old
man
sang
and
carols
of
christmas
such
as
at
home
in
the
olden
time
his
fathers
before
him
sang
in
their
norman
orchards
and
bright
burgundian
vineyards
close
at
her
father
side
was
the
gentle
evangeline
seated
spinning
flax
for
the
loom
that
stood
in
the
corner
behind
her
silent
awhile
were
its
treadles
at
rest
was
its
diligent
shuttle
while
the
monotonous
drone
of
the
wheel
like
the
drone
of
a
bagpipe
followed
the
old
man
song
and
united
the
fragments
together
as
in
a
church
when
the
chant
of
the
choir
at
intervals
ceases
footfalls
are
heard
in
the
aisles
or
words
of
the
priest
at
the
altar
so
in
each
pause
of
the
song
with
measured
motion
the
clock
clicked
thus
as
they
sat
there
were
footsteps
heard
and
suddenly
lifted
sounded
the
wooden
latch
and
the
door
swung
back
on
its
hinges
benedict
knew
by
the
shoes
it
was
basil
the
blacksmith
and
by
her
beating
heart
evangeline
knew
who
was
with
him
welcome
the
farmer
exclaimed
as
their
footsteps
paused
on
the
threshold
welcome
basil
my
friend
come
take
thy
place
on
the
settle
close
by
the
which
is
always
empty
without
thee
take
from
the
shelf
overhead
thy
pipe
and
the
box
of
tobacco
never
so
much
thyself
art
thou
as
when
through
the
curling
smoke
of
the
pipe
or
the
forge
thy
friendly
and
jovial
face
gleams
round
and
red
as
the
harvest
moon
through
the
mist
of
the
marshes
then
with
a
smile
of
content
thus
answered
basil
the
blacksmith
taking
with
easy
air
the
accustomed
seat
by
the
fireside
benedict
bellefontaine
thou
hast
ever
thy
jest
and
thy
ballad
ever
in
cheerfullest
mood
art
thou
when
others
are
filled
with
gloomy
forebodings
of
ill
and
see
only
ruin
before
them
happy
art
thou
as
if
every
day
thou
hadst
picked
up
a
horseshoe
pausing
a
moment
to
take
the
pipe
that
evangeline
brought
him
and
with
a
coal
from
the
embers
had
lighted
he
slowly
continued
four
days
now
are
passed
since
the
english
ships
at
their
anchors
ride
in
the
gaspereau
mouth
with
their
cannon
pointed
against
us
what
their
design
may
be
is
unknown
but
all
are
commanded
on
the
morrow
to
meet
in
the
church
where
his
majesty
mandate
will
be
proclaimed
as
law
in
the
land
alas
in
the
mean
time
many
surmises
of
evil
alarm
the
hearts
of
the
people
then
made
answer
the
farmer
perhaps
some
friendlier
purpose
brings
these
ships
to
our
shores
perhaps
the
harvests
in
england
by
untimely
rains
or
untimelier
heat
have
been
blighted
and
from
our
bursting
barns
they
would
feed
their
cattle
and
children
not
so
thinketh
the
folk
in
the
village
said
warmly
the
blacksmith
shaking
his
head
as
in
doubt
then
heaving
a
sigh
he
continued
louisburg
is
not
forgotten
nor
beau
sejour
nor
port
royal
many
already
have
fled
to
the
forest
and
lurk
on
its
outskirts
waiting
with
anxious
hearts
the
dubious
fate
of
tomorrow
arms
have
been
taken
from
us
and
warlike
weapons
of
all
kinds
nothing
is
left
but
the
blacksmith
sledge
and
the
scythe
of
the
mower
then
with
a
pleasant
smile
made
answer
the
jovial
farmer
safer
are
we
unarmed
in
the
midst
of
our
flocks
and
our
cornfields
safer
within
these
peaceful
dikes
besieged
by
the
ocean
than
our
fathers
in
forts
besieged
by
the
enemy
cannon
fear
no
evil
my
friend
and
may
no
shadow
of
sorrow
fall
on
this
house
and
hearth
for
this
is
the
night
of
the
contract
built
are
the
house
and
the
barn
the
merry
lads
of
the
village
strongly
have
built
them
and
well
and
breaking
the
glebe
round
about
them
filled
the
barn
with
hay
and
the
house
with
food
for
a
twelvemonth
rene
leblanc
will
be
here
anon
with
his
papers
and
inkhorn
shall
we
not
then
be
glad
and
rejoice
in
the
joy
of
our
children
as
apart
by
the
window
she
stood
with
her
hand
in
her
lover
blushing
evangeline
heard
the
words
that
her
father
had
spoken
and
as
they
died
on
his
lips
the
worthy
notary
entered
iii
bent
like
a
laboring
oar
that
toils
in
the
surf
of
the
ocean
bent
but
not
broken
by
age
was
the
form
of
the
notary
public
shocks
of
yellow
hair
like
the
silken
floss
of
the
maize
hung
over
his
shoulders
his
forehead
was
high
and
glasses
with
horn
bows
sat
astride
on
his
nose
with
a
look
of
wisdom
supernal
father
of
twenty
children
was
he
and
more
than
a
hundred
children
children
rode
on
his
knee
and
heard
his
great
watch
tick
four
long
years
in
the
times
of
the
war
had
he
languished
a
captive
suffering
much
in
an
old
french
fort
as
the
friend
of
the
english
now
though
warier
grown
without
all
guile
or
suspicion
ripe
in
wisdom
was
he
but
patient
and
simple
and
childlike
he
was
beloved
by
all
and
most
of
all
by
the
children
for
he
told
them
tales
of
the
in
the
forest
and
of
the
goblin
that
came
in
the
night
to
water
the
horses
and
of
the
white
letiche
the
ghost
of
a
child
who
unchristened
died
and
was
doomed
to
haunt
unseen
the
chambers
of
children
and
how
on
christmas
eve
the
oxen
talked
in
the
stable
and
how
the
fever
was
cured
by
a
spider
shut
up
in
a
nutshell
and
of
the
marvellous
powers
of
clover
and
horseshoes
with
whatsoever
else
was
writ
in
the
lore
of
the
village
then
up
rose
from
his
seat
by
the
fireside
basil
the
blacksmith
knocked
from
his
pipe
the
ashes
and
slowly
extending
his
right
hand
father
leblanc
he
exclaimed
thou
hast
heard
the
talk
in
the
village
and
perchance
canst
tell
us
some
news
of
these
ships
and
their
errand
then
with
modest
demeanor
made
answer
the
notary
public
gossip
enough
have
i
heard
in
sooth
yet
am
never
the
wiser
and
what
their
errand
may
be
i
know
not
better
than
others
yet
am
i
not
of
those
who
imagine
some
evil
intention
brings
them
here
for
we
are
at
peace
and
why
then
molest
us
god
name
shouted
the
hasty
and
somewhat
irascible
blacksmith
must
we
in
all
things
look
for
the
how
and
the
why
and
the
wherefore
daily
injustice
is
done
and
might
is
the
right
of
the
strongest
but
without
heeding
his
warmth
continued
the
notary
public
man
is
unjust
but
god
is
just
and
finally
justice
triumphs
and
well
i
remember
a
story
that
often
consoled
me
when
as
a
captive
i
lay
in
the
old
french
fort
at
port
royal
this
was
the
old
man
favorite
tale
and
he
loved
to
repeat
it
when
his
neighbors
complained
that
any
injustice
was
done
them
once
in
an
ancient
city
whose
name
i
no
longer
remember
raised
aloft
on
a
column
a
brazen
statue
of
justice
stood
in
the
public
square
upholding
the
scales
in
its
left
hand
and
in
its
right
a
sword
as
an
emblem
that
justice
presided
over
the
laws
of
the
land
and
the
hearts
and
homes
of
the
people
even
the
birds
had
built
their
nests
in
the
scales
of
the
balance
having
no
fear
of
the
sword
that
flashed
in
the
sunshine
above
them
but
in
the
course
of
time
the
laws
of
the
land
were
corrupted
might
took
the
place
of
right
and
the
weak
were
oppressed
and
the
mighty
ruled
with
an
iron
rod
then
it
chanced
in
a
nobleman
palace
that
a
necklace
of
pearls
was
lost
and
erelong
a
suspicion
fell
on
an
orphan
girl
who
lived
as
a
maid
in
the
household
she
after
form
of
trial
condemned
to
die
on
the
scaffold
patiently
met
her
doom
at
the
foot
of
the
statue
of
justice
as
to
her
father
in
heaven
her
innocent
spirit
ascended
lo
the
city
a
tempest
rose
and
the
bolts
of
the
thunder
smote
the
statue
of
bronze
and
hurled
in
wrath
from
its
left
hand
down
on
the
pavement
below
the
clattering
scales
of
the
balance
and
in
the
hollow
thereof
was
found
the
nest
of
a
magpie
into
whose
walls
the
necklace
of
pearls
was
inwoven
silenced
but
not
convinced
when
the
story
was
ended
the
blacksmith
stood
like
a
man
who
fain
would
speak
but
findeth
no
language
all
his
thoughts
were
congealed
into
lines
on
his
face
as
the
vapors
freeze
in
fantastic
shapes
on
the
in
the
winter
then
evangeline
lighted
the
brazen
lamp
on
the
table
filled
till
it
overflowed
the
pewter
tankard
with
ale
that
was
famed
for
its
strength
in
the
village
of
while
from
his
pocket
the
notary
drew
his
papers
and
inkhorn
wrote
with
a
steady
hand
the
date
and
the
age
of
the
parties
naming
the
dower
of
the
bride
in
flocks
of
sheep
and
in
cattle
orderly
all
things
proceeded
and
duly
and
well
were
completed
and
the
great
seal
of
the
law
was
set
like
a
sun
on
the
margin
then
from
his
leathern
pouch
the
farmer
threw
on
the
table
three
times
the
old
man
fee
in
solid
pieces
of
silver
and
the
notary
rising
and
blessing
the
bride
and
the
bridegroom
lifted
aloft
the
tankard
of
ale
and
drank
to
their
welfare
wiping
the
foam
from
his
lip
he
solemnly
bowed
and
departed
while
in
silence
the
others
sat
and
mused
by
the
fireside
till
evangeline
brought
the
out
of
its
corner
soon
was
the
game
begun
in
friendly
contention
the
old
men
laughed
at
each
lucky
hit
or
unsuccessful
manoeuvre
laughed
when
a
man
was
crowned
or
a
breach
was
made
in
the
meanwhile
apart
in
the
twilight
gloom
of
a
window
embrasure
sat
the
lovers
and
whispered
together
beholding
the
moon
rise
over
the
pallid
sea
and
the
silvery
mists
of
the
meadows
silently
one
by
one
in
the
infinite
meadows
of
heaven
blossomed
the
lovely
stars
the
of
the
angels
thus
was
the
evening
passed
anon
the
bell
from
the
belfry
rang
out
the
hour
of
nine
the
village
curfew
and
straightway
rose
the
guests
and
departed
and
silence
reigned
in
the
household
many
a
farewell
word
and
sweet
on
the
lingered
long
in
evangeline
heart
and
filled
it
with
gladness
carefully
then
were
covered
the
embers
that
glowed
on
the
and
on
the
oaken
stairs
resounded
the
tread
of
the
farmer
soon
with
a
soundless
step
the
foot
of
evangeline
followed
up
the
staircase
moved
a
luminous
space
in
the
darkness
lighted
less
by
the
lamp
than
the
shining
face
of
the
maiden
silent
she
passed
the
hall
and
entered
the
door
of
her
chamber
simple
that
chamber
was
with
its
curtains
of
white
and
its
ample
and
high
on
whose
spacious
shelves
were
carefully
folded
linen
and
woollen
stuffs
by
the
hand
of
evangeline
woven
this
was
the
precious
dower
she
would
bring
to
her
husband
in
marriage
better
than
flocks
and
herds
being
proofs
of
her
skill
as
a
housewife
soon
she
extinguished
her
lamp
for
the
mellow
and
radiant
moonlight
streamed
through
the
windows
and
lighted
the
room
till
the
heart
of
the
maiden
swelled
and
obeyed
its
power
like
the
tremulous
tides
of
the
ocean
ah
she
was
fair
exceeding
fair
to
behold
as
she
stood
with
naked
feet
on
the
gleaming
floor
of
her
chamber
little
she
dreamed
that
below
among
the
trees
of
the
orchard
waited
her
lover
and
watched
for
the
gleam
of
her
lamp
and
her
shadow
yet
were
her
thoughts
of
him
and
at
times
a
feeling
of
sadness
passed
her
soul
as
the
sailing
shade
of
clouds
in
the
moonlight
flitted
across
the
floor
and
darkened
the
room
for
a
moment
and
as
she
gazed
from
the
window
she
saw
serenely
the
moon
pass
forth
from
the
folds
of
a
cloud
and
one
star
follow
her
footsteps
as
out
of
abraham
tent
young
ishmael
wandered
with
hagar
iv
pleasantly
rose
next
morn
the
sun
on
the
village
of
pleasantly
gleamed
in
the
soft
sweet
air
the
basin
of
minas
where
the
ships
with
their
wavering
shadows
were
riding
at
anchor
life
had
long
been
astir
in
the
village
and
clamorous
labor
knocked
with
its
hundred
hands
at
the
golden
gates
of
the
morning
now
from
the
country
around
from
the
farms
and
neighboring
hamlets
came
in
their
holiday
dresses
the
blithe
acadian
peasants
many
a
glad
and
jocund
laugh
from
the
young
folk
made
the
bright
air
brighter
as
up
from
the
numerous
meadows
where
no
path
could
be
seen
but
the
track
of
wheels
in
the
greensward
group
after
group
appeared
and
joined
or
passed
on
the
highway
long
ere
noon
in
the
village
all
sounds
of
labor
were
silenced
thronged
were
the
streets
with
people
and
noisy
groups
at
the
sat
in
the
cheerful
sun
and
rejoiced
and
gossiped
together
every
house
was
an
inn
where
all
were
welcomed
and
feasted
for
with
this
simple
people
who
lived
like
brothers
together
all
things
were
held
in
common
and
what
one
had
was
another
yet
under
benedict
roof
hospitality
seemed
more
abundant
for
evangeline
stood
among
the
guests
of
her
father
bright
was
her
face
with
smiles
and
words
of
welcome
and
gladness
fell
from
her
beautiful
lips
and
blessed
the
cup
as
she
gave
it
under
the
open
sky
in
the
odorous
air
of
the
orchard
stript
of
its
golden
fruit
was
spread
the
feast
of
betrothal
there
in
the
shade
of
the
porch
were
the
priest
and
the
notary
seated
there
good
benedict
sat
and
sturdy
basil
the
blacksmith
not
far
withdrawn
from
these
by
the
and
the
beehives
michael
the
fiddler
was
placed
with
the
gayest
of
hearts
and
of
waistcoats
shadow
and
light
from
the
leaves
alternately
played
on
his
hair
as
it
waved
in
the
wind
and
the
jolly
face
of
the
fiddler
glowed
like
a
living
coal
when
the
ashes
are
blown
from
the
embers
gayly
the
old
man
sang
to
the
vibrant
sound
of
his
fiddle
les
bourgeois
de
and
carillon
de
and
anon
with
his
wooden
shoes
beat
time
to
the
music
merrily
merrily
whirled
the
wheels
of
the
dizzying
dances
under
the
and
down
the
path
to
the
meadows
old
folk
and
young
together
and
children
mingled
among
them
fairest
of
all
the
maids
was
evangeline
benedict
daughter
noblest
of
all
the
youths
was
gabriel
son
of
the
blacksmith
so
passed
the
morning
away
and
lo
with
a
summons
sonorous
sounded
the
bell
from
its
tower
and
over
the
meadows
a
drum
beat
thronged
erelong
was
the
church
with
men
without
in
the
churchyard
waited
the
women
they
stood
by
the
graves
and
hung
on
the
headstones
garlands
of
and
evergreens
fresh
from
the
forest
then
came
the
guard
from
the
ships
and
marching
proudly
among
them
entered
the
sacred
portal
with
loud
and
dissonant
clangor
echoed
the
sound
of
their
brazen
drums
from
ceiling
and
casement
echoed
a
moment
only
and
slowly
the
ponderous
portal
closed
and
in
silence
the
crowd
awaited
the
will
of
the
soldiers
then
uprose
their
commander
and
spake
from
the
steps
of
the
altar
holding
aloft
in
his
hands
with
its
seals
the
royal
commission
you
are
convened
this
day
he
said
by
his
majesty
orders
clement
and
kind
has
he
been
but
how
you
have
answered
his
kindness
let
your
own
hearts
reply
to
my
natural
make
and
my
temper
painful
the
task
is
i
do
which
to
you
i
know
must
be
grievous
yet
must
i
bow
and
obey
and
deliver
the
will
of
our
monarch
namely
that
all
your
lands
and
dwellings
and
cattle
of
all
kinds
forfeited
be
to
the
crown
and
that
you
yourselves
from
this
province
be
transported
to
other
lands
god
grant
you
may
dwell
there
ever
as
faithful
subjects
a
happy
and
peaceable
people
prisoners
now
i
declare
you
for
such
is
his
majesty
pleasure
as
when
the
air
is
serene
in
sultry
solstice
of
summer
suddenly
gathers
a
storm
and
the
deadly
sling
of
the
hailstones
beats
down
the
farmer
corn
in
the
field
and
shatters
his
windows
hiding
the
sun
and
strewing
the
ground
with
thatch
from
the
bellowing
fly
the
herds
and
seek
to
break
their
enclosures
so
on
the
hearts
of
the
people
descended
the
words
of
the
speaker
silent
a
moment
they
stood
in
speechless
wonder
and
then
rose
louder
and
ever
louder
a
wail
of
sorrow
and
anger
and
by
one
impulse
moved
they
madly
rushed
to
the
vain
was
the
hope
of
escape
and
cries
and
fierce
imprecations
rang
through
the
house
of
prayer
and
high
the
heads
of
the
others
rose
with
his
arms
uplifted
the
figure
of
basil
the
blacksmith
as
on
a
stormy
sea
a
spar
is
tossed
by
the
billows
flushed
was
his
face
and
distorted
with
passion
and
wildly
he
shouted
down
with
the
tyrants
of
england
we
never
have
sworn
them
allegiance
death
to
these
foreign
soldiers
who
seize
on
our
homes
and
our
harvests
more
he
fain
would
have
said
but
the
merciless
hand
of
a
soldier
smote
him
upon
the
mouth
and
dragged
him
down
to
the
pavement
in
the
midst
of
the
strife
and
tumult
of
angry
contention
lo
the
door
of
the
chancel
opened
and
father
felician
entered
with
serious
mien
and
ascended
the
steps
of
the
altar
raising
his
reverend
hand
with
a
gesture
he
awed
into
silence
all
that
clamorous
throng
and
thus
he
spake
to
his
people
deep
were
his
tones
and
solemn
in
accents
measured
and
mournful
spake
he
as
after
the
tocsin
alarum
distinctly
the
clock
strikes
what
is
this
that
ye
do
my
children
what
madness
has
seized
you
forty
years
of
my
life
have
i
labored
among
you
and
taught
you
not
in
word
alone
but
in
deed
to
love
one
another
is
this
the
fruit
of
my
toils
of
my
vigils
and
prayers
and
privations
have
you
so
soon
forgotten
all
lessons
of
love
and
forgiveness
this
is
the
house
of
the
prince
of
peace
and
would
you
profane
it
thus
with
violent
deeds
and
hearts
overflowing
with
hatred
lo
where
the
crucified
christ
from
his
cross
is
gazing
upon
you
see
in
those
sorrowful
eyes
what
meekness
and
holy
compassion
hark
how
those
lips
still
repeat
the
prayer
father
forgive
them
let
us
repeat
that
prayer
in
the
hour
when
the
wicked
assail
us
let
us
repeat
it
now
and
say
father
forgive
them
few
were
his
words
of
rebuke
but
deep
in
the
hearts
of
his
people
sank
they
and
sobs
of
contrition
succeeded
the
passionate
outbreak
while
they
repeated
his
prayer
and
said
o
father
forgive
them
then
came
the
evening
service
the
tapers
gleamed
from
the
altar
fervent
and
deep
was
the
voice
of
the
priest
and
the
people
responded
not
with
their
lips
alone
but
their
hearts
and
the
ave
maria
sang
they
and
fell
on
their
knees
and
their
souls
with
devotion
translated
rose
on
the
ardor
of
prayer
like
elijah
ascending
to
heaven
meanwhile
had
spread
in
the
village
the
tidings
of
ill
and
on
all
sides
wandered
wailing
from
house
to
house
the
women
and
children
long
at
her
father
door
evangeline
stood
with
her
right
hand
shielding
her
eyes
from
the
level
rays
of
the
sun
that
descending
lighted
the
village
street
with
mysterious
splendor
and
roofed
each
peasant
cottage
with
golden
thatch
and
emblazoned
its
windows
long
within
had
been
spread
the
cloth
on
the
table
there
stood
the
wheaten
loaf
and
the
honey
fragrant
with
there
stood
the
tankard
of
ale
and
the
cheese
fresh
brought
from
the
dairy
and
at
the
head
of
the
board
the
great
of
the
farmer
thus
did
evangeline
wait
at
her
father
door
as
the
sunset
threw
the
long
shadows
of
trees
the
broad
ambrosial
meadows
ah
on
her
spirit
within
a
deeper
shadow
had
fallen
and
from
the
fields
of
her
soul
a
fragrance
celestial
ascended
charity
meekness
love
and
hope
and
forgiveness
and
patience
then
of
self
she
wandered
into
the
village
cheering
with
looks
and
words
the
mournful
hearts
of
the
women
as
the
darkening
fields
with
lingering
steps
they
departed
urged
by
their
household
cares
and
the
weary
feet
of
their
children
down
sank
the
great
red
sun
and
in
golden
glimmering
vapors
veiled
the
light
of
his
face
like
the
prophet
descending
from
sinai
sweetly
over
the
village
the
bell
of
the
angelus
sounded
meanwhile
amid
the
gloom
by
the
church
evangeline
lingered
all
was
silent
within
and
in
vain
at
the
door
and
the
windows
stood
she
and
listened
and
looked
till
overcome
by
emotion
gabriel
cried
she
aloud
with
tremulous
voice
but
no
answer
came
from
the
graves
of
the
dead
nor
the
gloomier
grave
of
the
living
slowly
at
length
she
returned
to
the
tenantless
house
of
her
father
smouldered
the
fire
on
the
hearth
on
the
board
was
the
supper
untasted
empty
and
drear
was
each
room
and
haunted
with
phantoms
of
terror
sadly
echoed
her
step
on
the
stair
and
the
floor
of
her
chamber
in
the
dead
of
the
night
she
heard
the
disconsolate
rain
fall
loud
on
the
withered
leaves
of
the
by
the
window
keenly
the
lightning
flashed
and
the
voice
of
the
echoing
thunder
told
her
that
god
was
in
heaven
and
governed
the
world
he
created
then
she
remembered
the
tale
she
had
heard
of
the
justice
of
heaven
soothed
was
her
troubled
soul
and
she
peacefully
slumbered
till
morning
v
four
times
the
sun
had
risen
and
set
and
now
on
the
fifth
day
cheerily
called
the
cock
to
the
sleeping
maids
of
the
soon
the
yellow
fields
in
silent
and
mournful
procession
came
from
the
neighboring
hamlets
and
farms
the
acadian
women
driving
in
ponderous
wains
their
household
goods
to
the
pausing
and
looking
back
to
gaze
once
more
on
their
dwellings
ere
they
were
shut
from
sight
by
the
winding
road
and
the
woodland
close
at
their
sides
their
children
ran
and
urged
on
the
oxen
while
in
their
little
hands
they
clasped
some
fragments
of
playthings
thus
to
the
gaspereau
mouth
they
hurried
and
there
on
the
piled
in
confusion
lay
the
household
goods
of
the
peasants
all
day
long
between
the
shore
and
the
ships
did
the
boats
ply
all
day
long
the
wains
came
laboring
down
from
the
village
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
sun
was
near
to
his
setting
echoed
far
the
fields
came
the
roll
of
drums
from
the
churchyard
thither
the
women
and
children
thronged
on
a
sudden
the
opened
and
forth
came
the
guard
and
marching
in
gloomy
procession
followed
the
but
patient
acadian
farmers
even
as
pilgrims
who
journey
afar
from
their
homes
and
their
country
sing
as
they
go
and
in
singing
forget
they
are
weary
and
wayworn
so
with
songs
on
their
lips
the
acadian
peasants
descended
down
from
the
church
to
the
shore
amid
their
wives
and
their
daughters
foremost
the
young
men
came
and
raising
together
their
voices
sang
with
tremulous
lips
a
chant
of
the
catholic
missions
sacred
heart
of
the
saviour
o
inexhaustible
fountain
fill
our
hearts
this
day
with
strength
and
submission
and
patience
then
the
old
men
as
they
marched
and
the
women
that
stood
by
the
wayside
joined
in
the
sacred
psalm
and
the
birds
in
the
sunshine
above
them
mingled
their
notes
therewith
like
voices
of
spirits
departed
down
to
the
shore
evangeline
waited
in
silence
not
overcome
with
grief
but
strong
in
the
hour
of
affliction
calmly
and
sadly
she
waited
until
the
procession
approached
her
and
she
beheld
the
face
of
gabriel
pale
with
emotion
tears
then
filled
her
eyes
and
eagerly
running
to
meet
him
clasped
she
his
hands
and
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
whispered
gabriel
be
of
good
cheer
for
if
we
love
one
another
nothing
in
truth
can
harm
us
whatever
mischances
may
happen
smiling
she
spake
these
words
then
suddenly
paused
for
her
father
saw
she
slowly
advancing
alas
how
changed
was
his
aspect
gone
was
the
glow
from
his
cheek
and
the
fire
from
his
eye
and
his
footstep
heavier
seemed
with
the
weight
of
the
heavy
heart
in
his
bosom
but
with
a
smile
and
a
sigh
she
clasped
his
neck
and
embraced
him
speaking
words
of
endearment
where
words
of
comfort
availed
not
thus
to
the
gaspereau
mouth
moved
on
that
mournful
procession
there
disorder
prevailed
and
the
tumult
and
stir
of
embarking
busily
plied
the
freighted
boats
and
in
the
confusion
wives
were
torn
from
their
husbands
and
mothers
too
late
saw
their
children
left
on
the
land
extending
their
arms
with
wildest
entreaties
so
unto
separate
ships
were
basil
and
gabriel
carried
while
in
despair
on
the
shore
evangeline
stood
with
her
father
half
the
task
was
not
done
when
the
sun
went
down
and
the
twilight
deepened
and
darkened
around
and
in
haste
the
refluent
ocean
fled
away
from
the
shore
and
left
the
line
of
the
covered
with
waifs
of
the
tide
with
kelp
and
the
slippery
farther
back
in
the
midst
of
the
household
goods
and
the
wagons
like
to
a
gypsy
camp
or
a
leaguer
after
a
battle
all
escape
cut
off
by
the
sea
and
the
sentinels
near
them
lay
encamped
for
the
night
the
houseless
acadian
farmers
back
to
its
nethermost
caves
retreated
the
bellowing
ocean
dragging
adown
the
beach
the
rattling
pebbles
and
leaving
inland
and
far
up
the
shore
the
stranded
boats
of
the
sailors
then
as
the
night
descended
the
herds
returned
from
their
pastures
sweet
was
the
moist
still
air
with
the
odor
of
milk
from
their
udders
lowing
they
waited
and
long
at
the
bars
of
the
waited
and
looked
in
vain
for
the
voice
and
the
hand
of
the
silence
reigned
in
the
streets
from
the
church
no
angelus
sounded
rose
no
smoke
from
the
roofs
and
gleamed
no
lights
from
the
windows
but
on
the
shores
meanwhile
the
evening
fires
had
been
kindled
built
of
the
thrown
on
the
sands
from
wrecks
in
the
tempest
round
them
shapes
of
gloom
and
sorrowful
faces
were
gathered
voices
of
women
were
heard
and
of
men
and
the
crying
of
children
onward
from
fire
to
fire
as
from
hearth
to
hearth
in
his
parish
wandered
the
faithful
priest
consoling
and
blessing
and
cheering
like
unto
shipwrecked
paul
on
melita
desolate
thus
he
approached
the
place
where
evangeline
sat
with
her
father
and
in
the
flickering
light
beheld
the
face
of
the
old
man
haggard
and
hollow
and
wan
and
without
either
thought
or
emotion
as
the
face
of
a
clock
from
which
the
hands
have
been
taken
vainly
evangeline
strove
with
words
and
caresses
to
cheer
him
vainly
offered
him
food
yet
he
moved
not
he
looked
not
he
spake
not
but
with
a
vacant
stare
ever
gazed
at
the
flickering
murmured
the
priest
in
tones
of
compassion
more
he
fain
would
have
said
but
his
heart
was
full
and
his
accents
faltered
and
paused
on
his
lips
as
the
feet
of
a
child
on
a
threshold
hushed
by
the
scene
he
beholds
and
the
awful
presence
of
sorrow
silently
therefore
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
head
of
the
maiden
raising
his
tearful
eyes
to
the
silent
stars
that
above
them
moved
on
their
way
unperturbed
by
the
wrongs
and
sorrows
of
mortals
then
sat
he
down
at
her
side
and
they
wept
together
in
silence
suddenly
rose
from
the
south
a
light
as
in
autumn
the
moon
climbs
the
crystal
walls
of
heaven
and
the
horizon
stretches
its
hundred
hands
upon
mountain
and
meadow
seizing
the
rocks
and
the
rivers
and
piling
huge
shadows
together
broader
and
ever
broader
it
gleamed
on
the
roofs
of
the
village
gleamed
on
the
sky
and
sea
and
the
ships
that
lay
in
the
roadstead
columns
of
shining
smoke
uprose
and
flashes
of
flame
were
thrust
through
their
folds
and
withdrawn
like
the
quivering
hands
of
a
martyr
then
as
the
wind
seized
the
gleeds
and
the
burning
thatch
and
uplifting
whirled
them
aloft
through
the
air
at
once
from
a
hundred
started
the
sheeted
smoke
with
flashes
of
flame
intermingled
these
things
beheld
in
dismay
the
crowd
on
the
shore
and
on
shipboard
speechless
at
first
they
stood
then
cried
aloud
in
their
anguish
we
shall
behold
no
more
our
homes
in
the
village
of
loud
on
a
sudden
the
cocks
began
to
crow
in
the
thinking
the
day
had
dawned
and
anon
the
lowing
of
cattle
came
on
the
evening
breeze
by
the
barking
of
dogs
interrupted
then
rose
a
sound
of
dread
such
as
startles
the
sleeping
encampments
far
in
the
western
prairies
or
forests
that
skirt
the
nebraska
when
the
wild
horses
affrighted
sweep
by
with
the
speed
of
the
whirlwind
or
the
loud
bellowing
herds
of
buffaloes
rush
to
the
river
such
was
the
sound
that
arose
on
the
night
as
the
herds
and
the
horses
broke
through
their
folds
and
fences
and
madly
rushed
the
meadows
overwhelmed
with
the
sight
yet
speechless
the
priest
and
the
maiden
gazed
on
the
scene
of
terror
that
reddened
and
widened
before
them
and
as
they
turned
at
length
to
speak
to
their
silent
companion
lo
from
his
seat
he
had
fallen
and
stretched
abroad
on
the
motionless
lay
his
form
from
which
the
soul
had
departed
slowly
the
priest
uplifted
the
lifeless
head
and
the
maiden
knelt
at
her
father
side
and
wailed
aloud
in
her
terror
then
in
a
swoon
she
sank
and
lay
with
her
head
on
his
bosom
through
the
long
night
she
lay
in
deep
oblivious
slumber
and
when
she
awoke
from
the
trance
she
beheld
a
multitude
near
her
faces
of
friends
she
beheld
that
were
mournfully
gazing
upon
her
pallid
with
tearful
eyes
and
looks
of
saddest
compassion
still
the
blaze
of
the
burning
village
illumined
the
landscape
reddened
the
sky
overhead
and
gleamed
on
the
faces
around
her
and
like
the
day
of
doom
it
seemed
to
her
wavering
senses
then
a
familiar
voice
she
heard
as
it
said
to
the
people
let
us
bury
him
here
by
the
sea
when
a
happier
season
brings
us
again
to
our
homes
from
the
unknown
land
of
our
exile
then
shall
his
sacred
dust
be
piously
laid
in
the
churchyard
such
were
the
words
of
the
priest
and
there
in
haste
by
the
having
the
glare
of
the
burning
village
for
funeral
torches
but
without
bell
or
book
they
buried
the
farmer
of
and
as
the
voice
of
the
priest
repeated
the
service
of
sorrow
lo
with
a
mournful
sound
like
the
voice
of
a
vast
congregation
solemnly
answered
the
sea
and
mingled
its
roar
with
the
dirges
was
the
returning
tide
that
afar
from
the
waste
of
the
ocean
with
the
first
dawn
of
the
day
came
heaving
and
hurrying
landward
then
recommenced
once
more
the
stir
and
noise
of
embarking
and
with
the
ebb
of
the
tide
the
ships
sailed
out
of
the
harbor
leaving
behind
them
the
dead
on
the
shore
and
the
village
in
ruins
illustration
hiawatha
fishing
and
he
dropped
his
line
of
cedar
through
the
clear
transparent
water
the
song
of
hiawatha
hiawatha
sailing
give
me
of
your
bark
o
of
your
yellow
bark
o
growing
by
the
rushing
river
tall
and
stately
in
the
valley
i
a
light
canoe
will
build
me
build
a
swift
cheemaun
for
sailing
that
shall
float
upon
the
river
like
a
yellow
leaf
in
autumn
like
a
yellow
lay
aside
your
cloak
o
lay
aside
your
wrapper
for
the
is
coming
and
the
sun
is
warm
in
heaven
and
you
need
no
wrapper
thus
aloud
cried
hiawatha
in
the
solitary
forest
by
the
rushing
taquamenaw
when
the
birds
were
singing
gayly
in
the
moon
of
leaves
were
singing
and
the
sun
from
sleep
awaking
started
up
and
said
behold
me
geezis
the
great
sun
behold
me
and
the
tree
with
all
its
branches
rustled
in
the
breeze
of
morning
saying
with
a
sigh
of
patience
take
my
cloak
o
hiawatha
with
his
knife
the
tree
he
girdled
just
beneath
its
lowest
branches
just
above
the
roots
he
cut
it
till
the
sap
came
oozing
outward
down
the
trunk
from
top
to
bottom
sheer
he
cleft
the
bark
asunder
with
a
wooden
wedge
he
raised
it
stripped
it
from
the
trunk
unbroken
give
me
of
your
boughs
o
cedar
of
your
strong
and
pliant
branches
my
canoe
to
make
more
steady
make
more
strong
and
firm
beneath
me
through
the
summit
of
the
cedar
went
a
sound
a
cry
of
horror
went
a
murmur
of
resistance
but
it
whispered
bending
downward
take
my
boughs
o
hiawatha
down
he
hewed
the
boughs
of
cedar
shaped
them
straightway
to
a
like
two
bows
he
formed
and
shaped
them
like
two
bended
bows
together
give
me
of
your
roots
o
tamarack
of
your
fibrous
roots
o
my
canoe
to
bind
together
so
to
bind
the
ends
together
that
the
water
may
not
enter
that
the
river
may
not
wet
me
and
the
larch
with
all
its
fibres
shivered
in
the
air
of
morning
touched
his
forehead
with
its
tassels
said
with
one
long
sigh
of
sorrow
take
them
all
o
hiawatha
from
the
earth
he
tore
the
fibres
tore
the
tough
roots
of
the
closely
sewed
the
bark
together
bound
it
closely
to
the
give
me
of
your
balm
o
of
your
balsam
and
your
resin
so
to
close
the
seams
together
that
the
water
may
not
enter
that
the
river
may
not
wet
me
and
the
tall
and
sombre
sobbed
through
all
its
robes
of
darkness
rattled
like
a
shore
with
pebbles
answered
wailing
answered
weeping
take
my
balm
o
hiawatha
and
he
took
the
tears
of
balsam
took
the
resin
of
the
smeared
therewith
each
seam
and
fissure
made
each
crevice
safe
from
water
give
me
of
your
quills
o
hedgehog
all
your
quills
o
kagh
the
hedgehog
i
will
make
a
necklace
of
them
make
a
girdle
for
my
beauty
and
two
stars
to
deck
her
bosom
from
a
hollow
tree
the
hedgehog
with
his
sleepy
eyes
looked
at
him
shot
his
shining
quills
like
arrows
saying
with
a
drowsy
murmur
through
the
tangle
of
his
whiskers
take
my
quills
o
hiawatha
from
the
ground
the
quills
he
gathered
all
the
little
shining
arrows
stained
them
red
and
blue
and
yellow
with
the
juice
of
roots
and
berries
into
his
canoe
he
wrought
them
round
its
waist
a
shining
girdle
round
its
bows
a
gleaming
necklace
on
its
breast
two
stars
resplendent
thus
the
birch
canoe
was
builded
in
the
valley
by
the
river
in
the
bosom
of
the
forest
and
the
forest
life
was
in
it
all
its
mystery
and
its
magic
all
the
lightness
of
the
all
the
toughness
of
the
cedar
all
the
larch
supple
sinews
and
it
floated
on
the
river
like
a
yellow
leaf
in
autumn
like
a
yellow
paddles
none
had
hiawatha
paddles
none
he
had
or
needed
for
his
thoughts
as
paddles
served
him
and
his
wishes
served
to
guide
him
swift
or
slow
at
will
he
glided
veered
to
right
or
left
at
pleasure
then
he
called
aloud
to
kwasind
to
his
friend
the
strong
man
kwasind
saying
help
me
clear
this
river
of
its
sunken
logs
and
straight
into
the
river
kwasind
plunged
as
if
he
were
an
otter
dived
as
if
he
were
a
beaver
stood
up
to
his
waist
in
water
to
his
in
the
river
swam
and
shouted
in
the
river
tugged
at
sunken
logs
and
branches
with
his
hands
he
scooped
the
with
his
feet
the
ooze
and
tangle
and
thus
sailed
my
hiawatha
down
the
rushing
taquamenaw
sailed
through
all
its
bends
and
windings
sailed
through
all
its
deeps
and
shallows
while
his
friend
the
strong
man
kwasind
swam
the
deeps
the
shallows
waded
up
and
down
the
river
went
they
in
and
out
among
its
islands
cleared
its
bed
of
root
and
dragged
the
dead
trees
from
its
channel
made
its
passage
safe
and
certain
made
a
pathway
for
the
people
from
its
springs
among
the
mountains
to
the
waters
of
pauwating
to
the
bay
of
taquamenau
hiawatha
fishing
forth
upon
the
gitchie
gumee
on
the
shining
with
his
of
cedar
of
the
twisted
bark
of
cedar
forth
to
catch
the
sturgeon
nahma
king
of
fishes
in
his
birch
canoe
exulting
all
alone
went
hiawatha
through
the
clear
transparent
water
he
could
see
the
fishes
swimming
far
down
in
the
depths
below
him
see
the
yellow
perch
the
sahwa
like
a
sunbeam
in
the
water
see
the
shawgashee
the
like
a
spider
on
the
bottom
on
the
white
and
sandy
bottom
at
the
stern
sat
hiawatha
with
his
of
cedar
in
his
plumes
the
breeze
of
morning
played
as
in
the
hemlock
branches
on
the
bows
with
tail
erected
sat
the
squirrel
adjidaumo
in
his
fur
the
breeze
of
morning
played
as
in
the
prairie
grasses
on
the
white
sand
of
the
bottom
lay
the
monster
lay
the
sturgeon
king
of
fishes
through
his
gills
he
breathed
the
water
with
his
fins
he
fanned
and
winnowed
with
his
tail
he
swept
the
there
he
lay
in
all
his
armor
on
each
side
a
shield
to
guard
him
plates
of
bone
upon
his
forehead
down
his
sides
and
back
and
shoulders
plates
of
bone
with
spines
projecting
painted
was
he
with
his
stripes
of
yellow
red
and
azure
spots
of
brown
and
spots
of
sable
and
he
lay
there
on
the
bottom
fanning
with
his
fins
of
purple
as
above
him
hiawatha
in
his
birch
canoe
came
sailing
with
his
of
cedar
take
my
bait
cried
hiawatha
down
into
the
depths
beneath
him
take
my
bait
o
sturgeon
nahma
come
up
from
below
the
water
let
us
see
which
is
the
stronger
and
he
dropped
his
line
of
cedar
through
the
clear
transparent
water
waited
vainly
for
an
answer
long
sat
waiting
for
an
answer
and
repeating
loud
and
louder
take
my
bait
o
king
of
fishes
quiet
lay
the
sturgeon
nahma
fanning
slowly
in
the
water
looking
up
at
hiawatha
listening
to
his
call
and
clamor
his
unnecessary
tumult
till
he
wearied
of
the
shouting
and
he
said
to
the
kenozha
to
the
pike
the
maskenozha
take
the
bait
of
this
rude
fellow
break
the
line
of
hiawatha
in
his
fingers
hiawatha
felt
the
loose
line
jerk
and
tighten
as
he
drew
it
in
it
tugged
so
that
the
birch
canoe
stood
endwise
like
a
birch
log
in
the
water
with
the
squirrel
adjidaumo
perched
and
frisking
on
the
summit
full
of
scorn
was
hiawatha
when
he
saw
the
fish
rise
upward
saw
the
pike
the
maskenozha
coming
nearer
nearer
to
him
and
he
shouted
through
the
water
esa
esa
shame
upon
you
you
are
but
the
pike
kenozha
you
are
not
the
fish
i
wanted
you
are
not
the
king
of
fishes
reeling
downward
to
the
bottom
sank
the
pike
in
great
confusion
and
the
mighty
sturgeon
nahma
said
to
ugudwash
the
to
the
bream
with
scales
of
crimson
take
the
bait
of
this
great
boaster
break
the
line
of
hiawatha
slowly
upward
wavering
gleaming
rose
the
ugudwash
the
seized
the
line
of
hiawatha
swung
with
all
his
weight
upon
it
made
a
whirlpool
in
the
water
whirled
the
birch
canoe
in
circles
round
and
round
in
gurgling
eddies
till
the
circles
in
the
water
reached
the
sandy
beaches
till
the
and
rushes
nodded
on
the
distant
margins
but
when
hiawatha
saw
him
slowly
rising
through
the
water
lifting
up
his
disk
refulgent
loud
he
shouted
in
derision
esa
esa
shame
upon
you
you
are
ugudwash
the
you
are
not
the
fish
i
wanted
you
are
not
the
king
of
fishes
slowly
downward
wavering
gleaming
sank
the
ugudwash
the
and
again
the
sturgeon
nahma
heard
the
shout
of
hiawatha
heard
his
challenge
of
defiance
the
unnecessary
tumult
ringing
far
across
the
water
from
the
white
sand
of
the
bottom
up
he
rose
with
angry
gesture
quivering
in
each
nerve
and
fibre
clashing
all
his
plates
of
armor
gleaming
bright
with
all
his
in
his
wrath
he
darted
upward
flashing
leaped
into
the
sunshine
opened
his
great
jaws
and
swallowed
both
canoe
and
hiawatha
down
into
that
darksome
cavern
plunged
the
headlong
hiawatha
as
a
log
on
some
black
river
shoots
and
plunges
down
the
rapids
found
himself
in
utter
darkness
groped
about
in
helpless
wonder
till
he
felt
a
great
heart
beating
throbbing
in
that
utter
darkness
and
he
smote
it
in
his
anger
with
his
fist
the
heart
of
nahma
felt
the
mighty
king
of
fishes
shudder
through
each
nerve
and
fibre
heard
the
water
gurgle
round
him
as
he
leaped
and
staggered
through
it
sick
at
heart
and
faint
and
weary
crosswise
then
did
hiawatha
drag
his
for
safety
lest
from
out
the
jaws
of
nahma
in
the
turmoil
and
confusion
forth
he
might
be
hurled
and
perish
and
the
squirrel
adjidaumo
frisked
and
chattered
very
gayly
toiled
and
tugged
with
hiawatha
till
the
labor
was
completed
then
said
hiawatha
to
him
o
my
little
friend
the
squirrel
bravely
have
you
toiled
to
help
me
take
the
thanks
of
hiawatha
and
the
name
which
now
he
gives
you
for
hereafter
and
forever
boys
shall
call
you
adjidaumo
the
boys
shall
call
you
and
again
the
sturgeon
nahma
gasped
and
quivered
in
the
water
then
was
still
and
drifted
landward
till
he
grated
on
the
pebbles
till
the
listening
hiawatha
heard
him
grate
upon
the
margin
felt
him
strand
upon
the
pebbles
knew
that
nahma
king
of
fishes
lay
there
dead
upon
the
margin
then
he
heard
a
clang
and
flapping
as
of
many
wings
assembling
heard
a
screaming
and
confusion
as
of
birds
of
prey
contending
saw
a
gleam
of
light
above
him
shining
through
the
ribs
of
nahma
saw
the
glittering
eyes
of
of
kayoshk
the
peering
gazing
at
him
through
the
opening
heard
them
saying
to
each
other
is
our
brother
hiawatha
and
he
shouted
from
below
them
cried
exulting
from
the
caverns
o
ye
o
my
brothers
i
have
slain
the
sturgeon
nahma
make
the
rifts
a
little
larger
with
your
claws

openings
widen
set
me
free
from
this
dark
prison
and
henceforward
and
forever
men
shall
speak
of
your
achievements
calling
you
kayoshk
the
yes
kayoshk
the
noble
scratchers
and
the
wild
and
clamorous
toiled
with
beak
and
claws
together
made
the
rifts
and
openings
wider
in
the
mighty
ribs
of
nahma
and
from
peril
and
from
prison
from
the
body
of
the
sturgeon
from
the
peril
of
the
water
they
released
my
hiawatha
he
was
standing
near
his
wigwam
on
the
margin
of
the
water
and
he
called
to
old
nokomis
called
and
beckoned
to
nokomis
pointed
to
the
sturgeon
nahma
lying
lifeless
on
the
pebbles
with
the
feeding
on
him
i
have

king
of
fishes
said
he

upon

nothing
but
the
skeleton
of
nahma
illustration
the
building
of
the
ship
the
sun
shone
on
her
golden
hair
and
her
cheek
was
glowing
fresh
and
fair
the
building
of
the
ship
build
me
straight
o
worthy
master
stanch
and
strong
a
goodly
vessel
that
shall
laugh
at
all
disaster
and
with
wave
and
whirlwind
wrestle
the
merchant
word
delighted
the
master
heard
for
his
heart
was
in
his
work
and
the
heart
giveth
grace
unto
every
art
a
quiet
smile
played
round
his
lips
as
the
eddies
and
dimples
of
the
tide
play
round
the
bows
of
ships
that
steadily
at
anchor
ride
and
with
a
voice
that
was
full
of
glee
he
answered
erelong
we
will
launch
a
vessel
as
goodly
and
strong
and
stanch
as
ever
weathered
a
wintry
sea
and
first
with
nicest
skill
and
art
perfect
and
finished
in
every
part
a
little
model
the
master
wrought
which
should
be
to
the
larger
plan
what
the
child
is
to
the
man
its
counterpart
in
miniature
that
with
a
hand
more
swift
and
sure
the
greater
labor
might
be
brought
to
answer
to
his
inward
thought
and
as
he
labored
his
mind
ran
the
various
ships
that
were
built
of
yore
and
above
them
all
and
strangest
of
all
towered
the
great
harry
crank
and
tall
whose
picture
was
hanging
on
the
wall
with
bows
and
stern
raised
high
in
air
and
balconies
hanging
here
and
there
and
signal
lanterns
and
flags
afloat
and
eight
round
towers
like
those
that
frown
from
some
old
castle
looking
down
upon
the
drawbridge
and
the
moat
and
he
said
with
a
smile
our
ship
i
wis
shall
be
of
another
form
than
this
it
was
of
another
form
indeed
built
for
freight
and
yet
for
speed
a
beautiful
and
gallant
craft
broad
in
the
beam
that
the
stress
of
the
blast
pressing
down
upon
sail
and
mast
might
not
the
sharp
bows
overwhelm
broad
in
the
beam
but
sloping
aft
with
graceful
curve
and
slow
degrees
that
she
might
be
docile
to
the
helm
and
that
the
currents
of
parted
seas
closing
behind
with
mighty
force
might
aid
and
not
impede
her
course
in
the
stood
the
master
with
the
model
of
the
vessel
that
should
laugh
at
all
disaster
and
with
wave
and
whirlwind
wrestle
covering
many
a
rood
of
ground
lay
the
timber
piled
around
timber
of
chestnut
and
elm
and
oak
and
scattered
here
and
there
with
these
the
knarred
and
crooked
cedar
knees
brought
from
regions
far
away
from
pascagoula
sunny
bay
and
the
banks
of
the
roaring
roanoke
ah
what
a
wondrous
thing
it
is
to
note
how
many
wheels
of
toil
one
thought
one
word
can
set
in
motion
there
not
a
ship
that
sails
the
ocean
but
every
climate
every
soil
must
bring
its
tribute
great
or
small
and
help
to
build
the
wooden
wall
the
sun
was
rising
the
sea
and
long
the
level
shadows
lay
as
if
they
too
the
beams
would
be
of
some
great
airy
argosy
framed
and
launched
in
a
single
day
that
silent
architect
the
sun
had
hewn
and
laid
them
every
one
ere
the
work
of
man
was
yet
begun
beside
the
master
when
he
spoke
a
youth
against
an
anchor
leaning
listened
to
catch
his
slightest
meaning
only
the
long
waves
as
they
broke
in
ripples
on
the
pebbly
beach
interrupted
the
old
man
speech
beautiful
they
were
in
sooth
the
old
man
and
the
fiery
youth
the
old
man
in
whose
busy
brain
many
a
ship
that
sailed
the
main
was
modelled
and
again
the
fiery
youth
who
was
to
be
the
heir
of
his
dexterity
the
heir
of
his
house
and
his
daughter
hand
when
he
had
built
and
launched
from
land
what
the
elder
head
had
planned
thus
said
he
will
we
build
this
ship
lay
square
the
blocks
upon
the
slip
and
follow
well
this
plan
of
mine
choose
the
timbers
with
greatest
care
of
all
that
is
unsound
beware
for
only
what
is
sound
and
strong
to
this
vessel
shall
belong
cedar
of
maine
and
georgia
pine
here
together
shall
combine
a
goodly
frame
and
a
goodly
fame
and
the
union
be
her
name
for
the
day
that
gives
her
to
the
sea
shall
give
my
daughter
unto
thee
the
master
word
enraptured
the
young
man
heard
and
as
he
turned
his
face
aside
with
a
look
of
joy
and
a
thrill
of
pride
standing
before
her
father
door
he
saw
the
form
of
his
promised
bride
the
sun
shone
on
her
golden
hair
and
her
cheek
was
glowing
fresh
and
fair
with
the
breath
of
morn
and
the
soft
sea
air
like
a
beauteous
barge
was
she
still
at
rest
on
the
sandy
beach
just
beyond
the
billow
reach
but
he
was
the
restless
seething
stormy
sea
ah
how
skilful
grows
the
hand
that
obeyeth
love
command
it
is
the
heart
and
not
the
brain
that
to
the
highest
doth
attain
and
he
who
followeth
love
behest
far
excelleth
all
the
rest
thus
with
the
rising
of
the
sun
was
the
noble
task
begun
and
soon
throughout
the
bounds
were
heard
the
intermingled
sounds
of
axes
and
of
mallets
plied
with
vigorous
arms
on
every
side
plied
so
deftly
and
so
well
that
ere
the
shadows
of
evening
fell
the
keel
of
oak
for
a
noble
ship
scarfed
and
bolted
straight
and
strong
was
lying
ready
and
stretched
along
the
blocks
well
placed
upon
the
slip
happy
thrice
happy
every
one
who
sees
his
labor
well
begun
and
not
perplexed
and
multiplied
by
idly
waiting
for
time
and
tide
and
when
the
hot
long
day
was
the
young
man
at
the
master
door
sat
with
the
maiden
calm
and
still
and
within
the
porch
a
little
more
removed
beyond
the
evening
chill
the
father
sat
and
told
them
tales
of
wrecks
in
the
great
september
gales
of
pirates
coasting
the
spanish
main
and
ships
that
never
came
back
again
the
chance
and
change
of
a
sailor
life
want
and
plenty
rest
and
strife
his
roving
fancy
like
the
wind
that
nothing
can
stay
and
nothing
can
bind
and
the
magic
charm
of
foreign
lands
with
shadows
of
palms
and
shining
sands
where
the
tumbling
surf
the
coral
reefs
of
madagascar
washes
the
feet
of
the
swarthy
lascar
as
he
lies
alone
and
asleep
on
the
turf
and
the
trembling
maiden
held
her
breath
at
the
tales
of
that
awful
pitiless
sea
with
all
its
terror
and
mystery
the
dim
dark
sea
so
like
unto
death
that
divides
and
yet
unites
mankind
and
whenever
the
old
man
paused
a
gleam
from
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
would
awhile
illume
the
silent
group
in
the
twilight
gloom
and
thoughtful
faces
as
in
a
dream
and
for
a
moment
one
might
mark
what
had
been
hidden
by
the
dark
that
the
head
of
the
maiden
lay
at
rest
tenderly
on
the
young
man
breast
day
by
day
the
vessel
grew
with
timbers
fashioned
strong
and
true
stemson
and
keelson
and
till
framed
with
perfect
symmetry
a
skeleton
ship
rose
up
to
view
and
around
the
bows
and
along
the
side
the
heavy
hammers
and
mallets
plied
till
after
many
a
week
at
length
wonderful
for
form
and
strength
sublime
in
its
enormous
bulk
loomed
aloft
the
shadowy
hulk
and
around
it
columns
of
smoke
upwreathing
rose
from
the
boiling
bubbling
seething
caldron
that
glowed
and
overflowed
with
the
black
tar
heated
for
the
sheathing
and
amid
the
clamors
of
clattering
hammers
he
who
listened
heard
now
and
then
the
song
of
the
master
and
his
men
build
me
straight
o
worthy
master
stanch
and
strong
a
goodly
vessel
that
shall
laugh
at
all
disaster
and
with
wave
and
whirlwind
wrestle
with
oaken
brace
and
copper
band
lay
the
rudder
on
the
sand
that
like
a
thought
should
have
control
over
the
movement
of
the
whole
and
near
it
the
anchor
whose
giant
hand
would
reach
down
and
grapple
with
the
land
and
immovable
and
fast
hold
the
great
ship
against
the
bellowing
blast
and
at
the
bows
an
image
stood
by
a
cunning
artist
carved
in
wood
with
robes
of
white
that
far
behind
seemed
to
be
fluttering
in
the
wind
it
was
not
shaped
in
a
classic
mould
not
like
a
nymph
or
goddess
of
old
or
naiad
rising
from
the
water
but
modelled
from
the
master
daughter
on
many
a
dreary
and
misty
night
will
be
seen
by
the
rays
of
the
signal
light
speeding
along
through
the
rain
and
the
dark
like
a
ghost
in
its
sark
the
pilot
of
some
phantom
bark
guiding
the
vessel
in
its
flight
by
a
path
none
other
knows
aright
behold
at
last
each
tall
and
tapering
mast
is
swung
into
its
place
shrouds
and
stays
holding
it
firm
and
fast
long
ago
in
the
forests
of
maine
when
upon
mountain
and
plain
lay
the
snow
they
fell
those
lordly
pines
those
grand
majestic
pines
shouts
and
cheers
the
jaded
steers
panting
beneath
the
goad
dragged
down
the
weary
winding
road
those
captive
kings
so
straight
and
tall
to
be
shorn
of
their
streaming
hair
and
naked
and
bare
to
feel
the
stress
and
the
strain
of
the
wind
and
the
reeling
main
whose
roar
would
remind
them
forevermore
of
their
native
forests
they
should
not
see
again
and
everywhere
the
slender
graceful
spars
poise
aloft
in
the
air
and
at
the
white
blue
and
red
a
flag
unrolls
the
stripes
and
stars
ah
when
the
wanderer
lonely
friendless
in
foreign
harbors
shall
behold
that
flag
unrolled
will
be
as
a
friendly
hand
stretched
out
from
his
native
land
filling
his
heart
with
memories
sweet
and
endless
all
is
finished
and
at
length
has
come
the
bridal
day
of
beauty
and
of
strength
the
vessel
shall
be
launched
with
fleecy
clouds
the
sky
is
blanched
and
the
bay
slowly
in
all
its
splendors
dight
the
great
sun
rises
to
behold
the
sight
the
ocean
old
centuries
old
strong
as
youth
and
as
uncontrolled
paces
restless
to
and
fro
up
and
down
the
sands
of
gold
his
beating
heart
is
not
at
rest
and
far
and
wide
with
ceaseless
flow
his
beard
of
snow
heaves
with
the
heaving
of
his
breast
he
waits
impatient
for
his
bride
there
she
stands
with
her
foot
upon
the
sands
decked
with
flags
and
streamers
gay
in
honor
of
her
marriage
day
her
signals
fluttering
blending
round
her
like
a
veil
descending
ready
to
be
the
bride
of
the
gray
old
sea
on
the
deck
another
bride
is
standing
by
her
lover
side
shadows
from
the
flags
and
shrouds
like
the
shadows
cast
by
clouds
broken
by
many
a
sudden
fleck
fall
around
them
on
the
deck
the
prayer
is
said
the
service
read
the
joyous
bridegroom
bows
his
head
and
in
tears
the
good
old
master
shakes
the
brown
hand
of
his
son
kisses
his
daughter
glowing
cheek
in
silence
for
he
can
not
speak
and
ever
faster
down
his
own
the
tears
begin
to
run
the
worthy
pastor
the
shepherd
of
that
wandering
flock
that
has
the
ocean
for
its
wold
that
has
the
vessel
for
its
fold
leaping
ever
from
rock
to
rock
spake
with
accents
mild
and
clear
words
of
warning
words
of
cheer
but
tedious
to
the
bridegroom
ear
he
knew
the
chart
of
the
sailor
heart
all
its
pleasures
and
its
griefs
all
its
shallows
and
rocky
reefs
all
those
secret
currents
that
flow
with
such
resistless
undertow
and
lift
and
drift
with
terrible
force
the
will
from
its
moorings
and
its
course
therefore
he
spake
and
thus
said
he
like
unto
ships
far
off
at
sea
outward
or
homeward
bound
are
we
before
behind
and
all
around
floats
and
swings
the
horizon
bound
seems
at
its
distant
rim
to
rise
and
climb
the
crystal
wall
of
the
skies
and
then
again
to
turn
and
sink
as
if
we
could
slide
from
its
outer
brink
ah
it
is
not
the
sea
it
is
not
the
sea
that
sinks
and
shelves
but
ourselves
that
rock
and
rise
with
endless
and
uneasy
motion
now
touching
the
very
skies
now
sinking
into
the
depths
of
ocean
ah
if
our
souls
but
poise
and
swing
like
the
compass
in
its
brazen
ring
ever
level
and
ever
true
to
the
toil
and
the
task
we
have
to
do
we
shall
sail
securely
and
safely
reach
the
fortunate
isles
on
whose
shining
beach
the
sights
we
see
and
the
sounds
we
hear
will
be
those
of
joy
and
not
of
fear
then
the
master
with
a
gesture
of
command
waved
his
hand
and
at
the
word
loud
and
sudden
there
was
heard
all
around
them
and
below
the
sound
of
hammers
blow
on
blow
knocking
away
the
shores
and
spurs
and
see
she
stirs
she
starts
she
moves
she
seems
to
feel
the
thrill
of
life
along
her
keel
and
spurning
with
her
foot
the
ground
with
one
exulting
joyous
bound
she
leaps
into
the
ocean
arms
and
lo
from
the
assembled
crowd
there
rose
a
shout
prolonged
and
loud
that
to
the
ocean
seemed
to
say
take
her
o
bridegroom
old
and
gray
take
her
to
thy
protecting
arms
with
all
her
youth
and
all
her
charms
how
beautiful
she
is
how
fair
she
lies
within
those
arms
that
press
her
form
with
many
a
soft
caress
of
tenderness
and
watchful
care

paul
revere
ride
a
voice
in
the
darkness
a
knock
at
the
door
paul
revere
ride
listen
my
children
and
you
shall
hear
of
the
midnight
ride
of
paul
revere
on
the
eighteenth
of
april
in
hardly
a
man
is
now
alive
who
remembers
that
famous
day
and
year
he
said
to
his
friend
if
the
british
march
by
land
or
sea
from
the
town
hang
a
lantern
aloft
in
the
of
the
north
church
tower
as
a
signal
light
one
if
by
land
and
two
if
by
sea
and
i
on
the
opposite
shore
will
be
ready
to
ride
and
spread
the
alarm
through
every
middlesex
village
and
farm
for
the
country
folk
to
be
up
and
to
arm
then
he
said
good
night
and
with
muffled
oar
silently
rowed
to
the
charlestown
shore
just
as
the
moon
rose
over
the
bay
where
swinging
wide
at
her
moorings
lay
the
somerset
british
a
phantom
ship
with
each
mast
and
spar
across
the
moon
like
a
prison
bar
and
a
huge
black
hulk
that
was
magnified
by
its
own
reflection
in
the
tide
meanwhile
his
friend
through
alley
and
street
wanders
and
watches
with
eager
ears
till
in
the
silence
around
him
he
hears
the
muster
of
men
at
the
barrack
door
the
sound
of
arms
and
the
tramp
of
feet
and
the
measured
tread
of
the
grenadiers
marching
down
to
their
boats
on
the
shore
then
he
climbed
the
tower
of
the
old
north
church
by
the
wooden
stairs
with
stealthy
tread
to
the
overhead
and
startled
the
pigeons
from
their
perch
on
the
sombre
rafters
that
round
him
made
masses
and
moving
shapes
of
shade
by
the
trembling
ladder
steep
and
tall
to
the
highest
window
in
the
wall
where
he
paused
to
listen
and
look
down
a
moment
on
the
roofs
of
the
town
and
the
moonlight
flowing
over
all
beneath
in
the
churchyard
lay
the
dead
in
their
on
the
hill
wrapped
in
silence
so
deep
and
still
that
he
could
hear
like
a
sentinel
tread
the
watchful
as
it
went
creeping
along
from
tent
to
tent
and
seeming
to
whisper
all
is
well
a
moment
only
he
feels
the
spell
of
the
place
and
the
hour
and
the
secret
dread
of
the
lonely
belfry
and
the
dead
for
suddenly
all
his
thoughts
are
bent
on
a
shadowy
something
far
away
where
the
river
widens
to
meet
the
bay
a
line
of
black
that
bends
and
floats
on
the
rising
tide
like
a
bridge
of
boats
meanwhile
impatient
to
mount
and
ride
booted
and
spurred
with
a
heavy
stride
on
the
opposite
shore
walked
paul
revere
now
he
patted
his
horse
side
now
gazed
at
the
landscape
far
and
near
then
impetuous
stamped
the
earth
and
turned
and
tightened
his
but
mostly
he
watched
with
eager
search
the
of
the
old
north
church
as
it
rose
above
the
graves
on
the
hill
lonely
and
spectral
and
sombre
and
still
and
lo
as
he
looks
on
the
belfry
height
a
glimmer
and
then
a
gleam
of
light
he
springs
to
the
saddle
the
bridle
he
turns
but
lingers
and
gazes
till
full
on
his
sight
a
second
lamp
in
the
belfry
burns
a
hurry
of
hoofs
in
a
village
street
a
shape
in
the
moonlight
a
bulk
in
the
dark
and
beneath
from
the
pebbles
in
passing
a
spark
struck
out
by
a
steed
flying
fearless
and
fleet
that
was
all
and
yet
through
the
gloom
and
the
light
the
fate
of
a
nation
was
riding
that
night
and
the
spark
struck
out
by
that
steed
in
his
flight
kindled
the
land
into
flame
with
its
heat
he
has
left
the
village
and
mounted
the
steep
and
beneath
him
tranquil
and
broad
and
deep
is
the
mystic
meeting
the
ocean
tides
and
under
the
alders
that
skirt
its
edge
now
soft
on
the
sand
now
loud
on
the
ledge
is
heard
the
tramp
of
his
steed
as
he
rides
it
was
twelve
by
the
village
clock
when
he
crossed
the
bridge
into
medford
town
he
heard
the
crowing
of
the
cock
and
the
barking
of
the
farmer
dog
and
felt
the
damp
of
the
river
fog
that
rises
after
the
sun
goes
down
it
was
one
by
the
village
clock
when
he
galloped
into
lexington
he
saw
the
gilded
weathercock
swim
in
the
moonlight
as
he
passed
and
the
windows
blank
and
bare
gaze
at
him
with
a
spectral
glare
as
if
they
already
stood
aghast
at
the
bloody
work
they
would
look
upon
it
was
two
by
the
village
clock
when
he
came
to
the
bridge
in
concord
town
he
heard
the
bleating
of
the
flock
and
the
twitter
of
birds
among
the
trees
and
felt
the
breath
of
the
morning
breeze
blowing
over
the
meadows
brown
and
one
was
safe
and
asleep
in
his
bed
who
at
the
bridge
would
be
first
to
fall
who
that
day
would
be
lying
dead
pierced
by
a
british
you
know
the
rest
in
the
books
you
have
read
how
the
british
regulars
fired
and
fled
how
the
farmers
gave
them
ball
for
ball
from
behind
each
fence
and
wall
chasing
the
down
the
lane
then
crossing
the
fields
to
emerge
again
under
the
trees
at
the
turn
of
the
road
and
only
pausing
to
fire
and
load
so
through
the
night
rode
paul
revere
and
so
through
the
night
went
his
cry
of
alarm
to
every
middlesex
village
and
farm
a
cry
of
defiance
and
not
of
fear
a
voice
in
the
darkness
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
word
that
shall
echo
forevermore
for
borne
on
the
of
the
past
through
all
our
history
to
the
last
in
the
hour
of
darkness
and
peril
and
need
the
people
will
waken
and
listen
to
hear
the
hurrying
of
that
steed
and
the
midnight
message
of

the
building
of

his
by

said
it
would
bewilder
any
man

any
man
but
me
near

lay
the

stranded
built

old
by
raud
the
strong
and
king
olaf
had
commanded
he
should
build
another
dragon
twice
as
large
and
long
therefore
whistled
thorberg
skafting
as
he
sat
with
eyes
and
his
head
turned
sideways
drafting
that
new
vessel
for
king
olaf
twice

round
him
busily
hewed
and
hammered

sang
and
clamored
whirred
the
wheels
that
into
rigging
spun
the
shining
flax
all
this
tumult
heard
the
master

midnight
orgies
smoked

any
curse
could
you
not
be

a
minute
but
some
mischief
must
be
doing
turning
bad
to
worse
was
an
ill
wind
that
came
wafting
from
his
homestead
words
of
woe
to
his
farm
went
thorberg
skafting
oft
repeating
to
his
workmen
build
ye
thus
and
so
after
long
delays
returning
came
the
master
back
by
night
to
his
longing
yearning
hurried
he
and
did
not
leave
it
till
the
morning
light
come
and
see

the
king
finished

never
yet
was
seen
in

such
a
wondrous
thing

idly

rewards
to
his

with
wrath
his

grew
redder
than

scarlet
cloak
straight
the
smiling
answered
thus
the
angry
king
cease
blaspheming
and
reviling
olaf
it
was
thorberg
skafting
who
has
done
this
thing
then
he
chipped
and
smoothed
the
planking
till
the
king
delighted
swore
with
much
lauding
and
much
thanking
handsomer
