are

to

let
us
look
at
the
other
we
often
hear
spoken
of
no
such
persons
exist
there
are
girls
who
work
in
shops
they
make
their
living
that
way
but
why
turn
their
occupation
into
an
adjective
let
us
be
fair
we
do
not
refer
to
the
girls
who
live
on
fifth
avenue
as
lou
and
nancy
were
chums
they
came
to
the
big
city
to
find
work
because
there
was
not
enough
to
eat
at
their
homes
to
go
around
nancy
was
nineteen
lou
was
twenty
both
were
pretty
active
country
girls
who
had
no
ambition
to
go
on
the
stage
the
little
cherub
that
sits
up
aloft
guided
them
to
a
cheap
and
respectable
both
found
positions
and
became
they
remained
chums
it
is
at
the
end
of
six
months
that
i
would
beg
you
to
step
forward
and
be
introduced
to
them
meddlesome
reader
my
lady
friends
miss
nancy
and
miss
lou
while
you
are
shaking
hands
please
take
notice
cautiously
of
their
attire
yes
cautiously
for
they
are
as
quick
to
resent
a
stare
as
a
lady
in
a
box
at
the
horse
show
is
lou
is
a
ironer
in
a
hand
laundry
she
is
clothed
in
a
purple
dress
and
her
hat
plume
is
four
inches
too
long
but
her
ermine
muff
and
scarf
cost
and
its
fellow
beasts
will
be
ticketed
in
the
windows
at
before
the
season
is
over
her
cheeks
are
pink
and
her
light
blue
eyes
bright
contentment
radiates
from
her
nancy
you
would
call
a
because
you
have
the
habit
there
is
no
type
but
a
perverse
generation
is
always
seeking
a
type
so
this
is
what
the
type
should
be
she
has
the
pompadour
and
the
exaggerated
her
skirt
is
shoddy
but
has
the
correct
flare
no
furs
protect
her
against
the
bitter
spring
air
but
she
wears
her
short
broadcloth
jacket
as
jauntily
as
though
it
were
persian
lamb
on
her
face
and
in
her
eyes
remorseless
is
the
typical
expression
it
is
a
look
of
silent
but
contemptuous
revolt
against
cheated
womanhood
of
sad
prophecy
of
the
vengeance
to
come
when
she
laughs
her
loudest
the
look
is
still
there
the
same
look
can
be
seen
in
the
eyes
of
russian
peasants
and
those
of
us
left
will
see
it
some
day
on
face
when
he
comes
to
blow
us
up
it
is
a
look
that
should
wither
and
abash
man
but
he
has
been
known
to
smirk
at
it
and
offer
flowers
with
a
string
tied
to
them
now
lift
your
hat
and
come
away
while
you
receive
lou
cheery
see
you
again
and
the
sardonic
sweet
smile
of
nancy
that
seems
somehow
to
miss
you
and
go
fluttering
like
a
white
moth
up
over
the
housetops
to
the
stars
the
two
waited
on
the
corner
for
dan
dan
was
lou
steady
company
faithful
well
he
was
on
hand
when
mary
would
have
had
to
hire
a
dozen
subpoena
servers
to
find
her
lamb
ai
you
cold
nance
said
lou
say
what
a
chump
you
are
for
working
in
that
old
store
for
a
week
i
made
last
week
of
course
ironing
ai
as
swell
work
as
selling
lace
behind
a
counter
but
it
pays
none
of
us
ironers
make
less
than
and
i
do
know
that
it
any
less
respectful
work
either
you
can
have
it
said
nancy
with
uplifted
nose
i
take
my
eight
a
week
and
hall
bedroom
i
like
to
be
among
nice
things
and
swell
people
and
look
what
a
chance
i
got
why
one
of
our
glove
girls
married
a
pittsburg
steel
maker
or
blacksmith
or
something
the
other
day
worth
a
million
dollars
i
catch
a
swell
myself
some
time
i
ai
bragging
on
my
looks
or
anything
but
i
take
my
chances
where
there
big
prizes
offered
what
show
would
a
girl
have
in
a
laundry
why
that
where
i
met
dan
said
lou
triumphantly
he
came
in
for
his
sunday
shirt
and
collars
and
saw
me
at
the
first
board
ironing
we
all
try
to
get
to
work
at
the
first
board
ella
maginnis
was
sick
that
day
and
i
had
her
place
he
said
he
noticed
my
arms
first
how
round
and
white
they
was
i
had
my
sleeves
rolled
up
some
nice
fellows
come
into
laundries
you
can
tell
by
their
bringing
their
clothes
in
suit
cases
and
turning
in
the
door
sharp
and
sudden
how
can
you
wear
a
waist
like
that
lou
said
nancy
gazing
down
at
the
offending
article
with
sweet
scorn
in
her
eyes
it
shows
fierce
taste
this
waist
cried
lou
with
indignation
why
i
paid
for
this
waist
it
worth
a
woman
left
it
to
be
laundered
and
never
called
for
it
the
boss
sold
it
to
me
it
got
yards
and
yards
of
hand
embroidery
on
it
better
talk
about
that
ugly
plain
thing
you
got
on
this
ugly
plain
thing
said
nancy
calmly
was
copied
from
one
that
van
alstyne
fisher
was
wearing
the
girls
say
her
bill
in
the
store
last
year
was
i
made
mine
myself
it
cost
me
ten
feet
away
you
could
tell
it
from
hers
oh
well
said
lou
if
you
want
to
starve
and
put
on
airs
go
ahead
but
i
take
my
job
and
good
wages
and
after
hours
give
me
something
as
fancy
and
attractive
to
wear
as
i
am
able
to
buy
but
just
then
dan
came
a
serious
young
man
with
a
necktie
who
had
escaped
the
city
brand
of
frivolity
an
electrician
earning
dollars
per
week
who
looked
upon
lou
with
the
sad
eyes
of
romeo
and
thought
her
embroidered
waist
a
web
in
which
any
fly
should
delight
to
be
caught
my
friend
owens
shake
hands
with
miss
danforth
said
lou
i
mighty
glad
to
know
you
miss
danforth
said
dan
with
outstretched
hand
i
heard
lou
speak
of
you
so
often
thanks
said
nancy
touching
his
fingers
with
the
tips
of
her
cool
ones
i
heard
her
mention
you
a
few
times
lou
giggled
did
you
get
that
handshake
from
van
alstyne
fisher
nance
she
asked
if
i
did
you
can
feel
safe
in
copying
it
said
nancy
oh
i
could
use
it
at
all
it
too
stylish
for
me
intended
to
set
off
diamond
rings
that
high
shake
is
wait
till
i
get
a
few
and
then
i
try
it
learn
it
first
said
nancy
wisely
and
you
be
more
likely
to
get
the
rings
now
to
settle
this
argument
said
dan
with
his
ready
cheerful
smile
let
me
make
a
proposition
as
i
ca
take
both
of
you
up
to
tiffany
and
do
the
right
thing
what
do
you
say
to
a
little
vaudeville
i
got
the
tickets
how
about
looking
at
stage
diamonds
since
we
ca
shake
hands
with
the
real
sparklers
the
faithful
squire
took
his
place
close
to
the
curb
lou
next
a
little
peacocky
in
her
bright
and
pretty
clothes
nancy
on
the
inside
slender
and
soberly
clothed
as
the
sparrow
but
with
the
true
van
alstyne
fisher
walk
thus
they
set
out
for
their
moderate
diversion
i
do
not
suppose
that
many
look
upon
a
great
department
store
as
an
educational
institution
but
the
one
in
which
nancy
worked
was
something
like
that
to
her
she
was
surrounded
by
beautiful
things
that
breathed
of
taste
and
refinement
if
you
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
luxury
luxury
is
yours
whether
your
money
pays
for
it
or
another
the
people
she
served
were
mostly
women
whose
dress
manners
and
position
in
the
social
world
were
quoted
as
criterions
from
them
nancy
began
to
take
toll
the
best
from
each
according
to
her
view
from
one
she
would
copy
and
practice
a
gesture
from
another
an
eloquent
lifting
of
an
eyebrow
from
others
a
manner
of
walking
of
carrying
a
purse
of
smiling
of
greeting
a
friend
of
addressing
inferiors
in
station
from
her
best
beloved
model
van
alstyne
fisher
she
made
requisition
for
that
excellent
thing
a
soft
low
voice
as
clear
as
silver
and
as
perfect
in
articulation
as
the
notes
of
a
thrush
suffused
in
the
aura
of
this
high
social
refinement
and
good
breeding
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
escape
a
deeper
effect
of
it
as
good
habits
are
said
to
be
better
than
good
principles
so
perhaps
good
manners
are
better
than
good
habits
the
teachings
of
your
parents
may
not
keep
alive
your
new
england
conscience
but
if
you
sit
on
a
chair
and
repeat
the
words
prisms
and
pilgrims
forty
times
the
devil
will
flee
from
you
and
when
nancy
spoke
in
the
van
alstyne
fisher
tones
she
felt
the
thrill
of
to
her
very
bones
there
was
another
source
of
learning
in
the
great
departmental
school
whenever
you
see
three
or
four
gather
in
a
bunch
and
jingle
their
wire
bracelets
as
an
accompaniment
to
apparently
frivolous
conversation
do
not
think
that
they
are
there
for
the
purpose
of
criticizing
the
way
ethel
does
her
back
hair
the
meeting
may
lack
the
dignity
of
the
deliberative
bodies
of
man
but
it
has
all
the
importance
of
the
occasion
on
which
eve
and
her
first
daughter
first
put
their
heads
together
to
make
adam
understand
his
proper
place
in
the
household
it
is
woman
conference
for
common
defense
and
exchange
of
strategical
theories
of
attack
and
repulse
upon
and
against
the
world
which
is
a
stage
and
man
its
audience
who
persists
in
throwing
bouquets
thereupon
woman
the
most
helpless
of
the
young
of
any
animal
with
the
fawn
grace
but
without
its
fleetness
with
the
bird
beauty
but
without
its
power
of
flight
with
the
burden
of
sweetness
but
without
its
oh
let
drop
that
simile
some
of
us
may
have
been
stung
during
this
council
of
war
they
pass
weapons
one
to
another
and
exchange
stratagems
that
each
has
devised
and
formulated
out
of
the
tactics
of
life
i
says
to
says
sadie
ai
you
the
fresh
thing
who
do
you
suppose
i
am
to
be
addressing
such
a
remark
to
me
and
what
do
you
think
he
says
back
to
me
the
heads
brown
black
flaxen
red
and
yellow
bob
together
the
answer
is
given
and
the
parry
to
the
thrust
is
decided
upon
to
be
used
by
each
thereafter
in
with
the
common
enemy
man
thus
nancy
learned
the
art
of
defense
and
to
women
successful
defense
means
victory
the
curriculum
of
a
department
store
is
a
wide
one
perhaps
no
other
college
could
have
fitted
her
as
well
for
her
life
ambition
the
drawing
of
a
matrimonial
prize
her
station
in
the
store
was
a
favored
one
the
music
room
was
near
enough
for
her
to
hear
and
become
familiar
with
the
works
of
the
best
composers
at
least
to
acquire
the
familiarity
that
passed
for
appreciation
in
the
social
world
in
which
she
was
vaguely
trying
to
set
a
tentative
and
aspiring
foot
she
absorbed
the
educating
influence
of
art
wares
of
costly
and
dainty
fabrics
of
adornments
that
are
almost
culture
to
women
the
other
girls
soon
became
aware
of
nancy
ambition
here
comes
your
millionaire
nancy
they
would
call
to
her
whenever
any
man
who
looked
the
rôle
approached
her
counter
it
got
to
be
a
habit
of
men
who
were
hanging
about
while
their
women
folk
were
shopping
to
stroll
over
to
the
handkerchief
counter
and
dawdle
over
the
cambric
squares
nancy
imitation
air
and
genuine
dainty
beauty
was
what
attracted
many
men
thus
came
to
display
their
graces
before
her
some
of
them
may
have
been
millionaires
others
were
certainly
no
more
than
their
sedulous
apes
nancy
learned
to
discriminate
there
was
a
window
at
the
end
of
the
handkerchief
counter
and
she
could
see
the
rows
of
vehicles
waiting
for
the
shoppers
in
the
street
below
she
looked
and
perceived
that
automobiles
differ
as
well
as
do
their
owners
once
a
fascinating
gentleman
bought
four
dozen
handkerchiefs
and
wooed
her
across
the
counter
with
a
king
cophetua
air
when
he
had
gone
one
of
the
girls
said
what
wrong
nance
that
you
did
warm
up
to
that
fellow
he
looks
the
swell
article
all
right
to
me
him
said
nancy
with
her
coolest
sweetest
most
impersonal
van
alstyne
fisher
smile
not
for
mine
i
saw
him
drive
up
outside
a
machine
and
an
irish
chauffeur
and
you
saw
what
kind
of
handkerchiefs
he
bought
silk
and
he
got
dactylis
on
him
give
me
the
real
thing
or
nothing
if
you
please
two
of
the
most
refined
women
in
the
store
a
forelady
and
a
cashier
had
a
few
swell
gentlemen
friends
with
whom
they
now
and
then
dined
once
they
included
nancy
in
an
invitation
the
dinner
took
place
in
a
spectacular
café
whose
tables
are
engaged
for
new
year
eve
a
year
in
advance
there
were
two
gentlemen
friends
one
without
any
hair
on
his
head
high
living
ungrew
it
and
we
can
prove
it
the
other
a
young
man
whose
worth
and
sophistication
he
impressed
upon
you
in
two
convincing
ways
he
swore
that
all
the
wine
was
corked
and
he
wore
diamond
cuff
buttons
this
young
man
perceived
irresistible
excellencies
in
nancy
his
taste
ran
to
and
here
was
one
that
added
the
voice
and
manners
of
his
high
social
world
to
the
franker
charms
of
her
own
caste
so
on
the
following
day
he
appeared
in
the
store
and
made
her
a
serious
proposal
of
marriage
over
a
box
of
irish
linens
nancy
declined
a
brown
pompadour
ten
feet
away
had
been
using
her
eyes
and
ears
when
the
rejected
suitor
had
gone
she
heaped
carboys
of
upbraidings
and
horror
upon
nancy
head
what
a
terrible
little
fool
you
are
that
fellow
a
millionaire
a
nephew
of
old
van
skittles
himself
and
he
was
talking
on
the
level
too
have
you
gone
crazy
nance
have
i
said
nancy
i
did
take
him
did
i
he
is
a
millionaire
so
hard
that
you
could
notice
it
anyhow
his
family
only
allows
him
a
year
to
spend
the
fellow
was
guying
him
about
it
the
other
night
at
supper
the
brown
pompadour
came
nearer
and
narrowed
her
eyes
say
what
do
you
want
she
inquired
in
a
voice
hoarse
for
lack
of
ai
that
enough
for
you
do
you
want
to
be
a
mormon
and
marry
rockefeller
and
gladstone
dowie
and
the
king
of
spain
and
the
whole
bunch
ai
a
year
good
enough
for
you
nancy
flushed
a
little
under
the
level
gaze
of
the
black
shallow
eyes
it
was
altogether
the
money
carrie
she
explained
his
friend
caught
him
in
a
rank
lie
the
other
night
at
dinner
it
was
about
some
girl
he
said
he
had
been
to
the
theater
with
well
i
stand
a
liar
put
everything
together
i
do
like
him
and
that
settles
it
when
i
sell
out
it
not
going
to
be
on
any
bargain
day
i
got
to
have
something
that
sits
up
in
a
chair
like
a
man
anyhow
yes
i
looking
out
for
a
catch
but
it
got
to
be
able
to
do
something
more
than
make
a
noise
like
a
toy
bank
the
physiopathic
ward
for
yours
said
the
brown
pompadour
walking
away
these
high
ideas
if
not
ideals
nancy
continued
to
cultivate
on
per
week
she
bivouacked
on
the
trail
of
the
great
unknown
catch
eating
her
dry
bread
and
tightening
her
belt
day
by
day
on
her
face
was
the
faint
soldierly
sweet
grim
smile
of
the
preordained
the
store
was
her
forest
and
many
times
she
raised
her
rifle
at
game
that
seemed
and
big
but
always
some
deep
unerring
instinct
perhaps
of
the
huntress
perhaps
of
the
woman
made
her
hold
her
fire
and
take
up
the
trail
again
lou
flourished
in
the
laundry
out
of
her
per
week
she
paid
for
her
room
and
board
the
rest
went
mainly
for
clothes
her
opportunities
for
bettering
her
taste
and
manners
were
few
compared
with
nancy
in
the
steaming
laundry
there
was
nothing
but
work
work
and
her
thoughts
of
the
evening
pleasures
to
come
many
costly
and
showy
fabrics
passed
under
her
iron
and
it
may
be
that
her
growing
fondness
for
dress
was
thus
transmitted
to
her
through
the
conducting
metal
when
the
day
work
was
over
dan
awaited
her
outside
her
faithful
shadow
in
whatever
light
she
stood
sometimes
he
cast
an
honest
and
troubled
glance
at
lou
clothes
that
increased
in
conspicuity
rather
than
in
style
but
this
was
no
disloyalty
he
deprecated
the
attention
they
called
to
her
in
the
streets
and
lou
was
no
less
faithful
to
her
chum
there
was
a
law
that
nancy
should
go
with
them
on
whatsoever
outings
they
might
take
dan
bore
the
extra
burden
heartily
and
in
good
cheer
it
might
be
said
that
lou
furnished
the
color
nancy
the
tone
and
dan
the
weight
of
the
trio
the
escort
in
his
neat
but
obviously
suit
his
tie
and
unfailing
genial
wit
never
startled
or
clashed
he
was
of
that
good
kind
that
you
are
likely
to
forget
while
they
are
present
but
remember
distinctly
after
they
are
gone
to
nancy
superior
taste
the
flavor
of
these
pleasures
was
sometimes
a
little
bitter
but
she
was
young
and
youth
is
a
gourmand
when
it
can
not
be
a
gourmet
dan
is
always
wanting
me
to
marry
him
right
away
lou
told
her
once
but
why
should
i
i
independent
i
can
do
as
i
please
with
the
money
i
earn
and
he
never
would
agree
for
me
to
keep
on
working
afterward
and
say
nance
what
do
you
want
to
stick
to
that
old
store
for
and
half
starve
and
half
dress
yourself
i
could
get
you
a
place
in
the
laundry
right
now
if
you
come
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
afford
to
be
a
little
less
if
you
could
make
a
good
deal
more
money
i
do
think
i
lou
said
nancy
but
i
rather
live
on
half
rations
and
stay
where
i
am
i
suppose
i
got
the
habit
it
the
chance
that
i
want
i
do
expect
to
be
always
behind
a
counter
i
learning
something
new
every
day
i
right
up
against
refined
and
rich
people
all
the
time
even
if
i
do
only
wait
on
them
and
i
not
missing
any
pointers
that
i
see
passing
around
caught
your
millionaire
yet
asked
lou
with
her
teasing
laugh
i
have
selected
one
yet
answered
nancy
i
been
looking
them
over
goodness
the
idea
of
picking
over
do
you
ever
let
one
get
by
you
nance
even
if
he
a
few
dollars
shy
but
of
course
joking
millionaires
do
think
about
working
girls
like
us
it
might
be
better
for
them
if
they
did
said
nancy
with
cool
wisdom
some
of
us
could
teach
them
how
to
take
care
of
their
money
if
one
was
to
speak
to
me
laughed
lou
i
know
i
have
a
that
because
you
do
know
any
the
only
difference
between
swells
and
other
people
is
you
have
to
watch
closer
do
you
think
that
red
silk
lining
is
just
a
little
bit
too
bright
for
that
coat
lou
lou
looked
at
the
plain
dull
olive
jacket
of
her
friend
well
no
i
do
but
it
may
seem
so
beside
that
thing
you
got
on
this
jacket
said
nancy
complacently
has
exactly
the
cut
and
fit
of
one
that
van
alstyne
fisher
was
wearing
the
other
day
the
material
cost
me
i
suppose
hers
cost
about
more
oh
well
said
lou
lightly
it
do
strike
me
as
millionaire
bait
should
wonder
if
i
catch
one
before
you
do
anyway
truly
it
would
have
taken
a
philosopher
to
decide
upon
the
values
of
the
theories
held
by
the
two
friends
lou
lacking
that
certain
pride
and
fastidiousness
that
keeps
stores
and
desks
filled
with
girls
working
for
the
barest
living
thumped
away
gaily
with
her
iron
in
the
noisy
and
stifling
laundry
her
wages
supported
her
even
beyond
the
point
of
comfort
so
that
her
dress
profited
until
sometimes
she
cast
a
sidelong
glance
of
impatience
at
the
neat
but
inelegant
apparel
of
dan
dan
the
constant
the
immutable
the
undeviating
as
for
nancy
her
case
was
one
of
tens
of
thousands
silk
and
jewels
and
laces
and
ornaments
and
the
perfume
and
music
of
the
fine
world
of
and
taste
these
were
made
for
woman
they
are
her
equitable
portion
let
her
keep
near
them
if
they
are
a
part
of
life
to
her
and
if
she
will
she
is
no
traitor
to
herself
as
esau
was
for
she
keeps
her
birthright
and
the
pottage
she
earns
is
often
very
scant
in
this
atmosphere
nancy
belonged
and
she
throve
in
it
and
ate
her
frugal
meals
and
schemed
over
her
cheap
dresses
with
a
determined
and
contented
mind
she
already
knew
woman
and
she
was
studying
man
the
animal
both
as
to
his
habits
and
eligibility
some
day
she
would
bring
down
the
game
that
she
wanted
but
she
promised
herself
it
would
be
what
seemed
to
her
the
biggest
and
the
best
and
nothing
smaller
thus
she
kept
her
lamp
trimmed
and
burning
to
receive
the
bridegroom
when
he
should
come
but
another
lesson
she
learned
perhaps
unconsciously
her
standard
of
values
began
to
shift
and
change
sometimes
the
grew
blurred
in
her
mind
eye
and
shaped
itself
into
letters
that
spelled
such
words
as
truth
and
honor
and
now
and
then
just
kindness
let
us
make
a
likeness
of
one
who
hunts
the
moose
or
elk
in
some
mighty
wood
he
sees
a
little
dell
mossy
and
embowered
where
a
rill
trickles
babbling
to
him
of
rest
and
comfort
at
these
times
the
spear
of
nimrod
himself
grows
blunt
so
nancy
wondered
sometimes
if
persian
lamb
was
always
quoted
at
its
market
value
by
the
hearts
that
it
covered
one
thursday
evening
nancy
left
the
store
and
turned
across
sixth
avenue
westward
to
the
laundry
she
was
expected
to
go
with
lou
and
dan
to
a
musical
comedy
dan
was
just
coming
out
of
the
laundry
when
she
arrived
there
was
a
queer
strained
look
on
his
face
i
thought
i
would
drop
around
to
see
if
they
had
heard
from
her
he
said
heard
from
who
asked
nancy
is
lou
there
i
thought
you
knew
said
dan
she
has
been
here
or
at
the
house
where
she
lived
since
monday
she
moved
all
her
things
from
there
she
told
one
of
the
girls
in
the
laundry
she
might
be
going
to
europe
has
anybody
seen
her
anywhere
asked
nancy
dan
looked
at
her
with
his
jaws
set
grimly
and
a
steely
gleam
in
his
steady
gray
eyes
they
told
me
in
the
laundry
he
said
harshly
that
they
saw
her
pass
yesterday
in
an
automobile
with
one
of
the
millionaires
i
suppose
that
you
and
lou
were
forever
busying
your
brains
about
for
the
first
time
nancy
quailed
before
a
man
she
laid
her
hand
that
trembled
slightly
on
dan
sleeve
you
no
right
to
say
such
a
thing
to
me
dan
as
if
i
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
did
mean
it
that
way
said
dan
softening
he
fumbled
in
his
vest
pocket
i
got
the
tickets
for
the
show
he
said
with
a
gallant
show
of
lightness
if
you
nancy
admired
pluck
whenever
she
saw
it
i
go
with
you
dan
she
said
three
months
went
by
before
nancy
saw
lou
again
at
twilight
one
evening
the
was
hurrying
home
along
the
border
of
a
little
quiet
park
she
heard
her
name
called
and
wheeled
about
in
time
to
catch
lou
rushing
into
her
arms
after
the
first
embrace
they
drew
their
heads
back
as
serpents
do
ready
to
attack
or
to
charm
with
a
thousand
questions
trembling
on
their
swift
tongues
and
then
nancy
noticed
that
prosperity
had
descended
upon
lou
manifesting
itself
in
costly
furs
flashing
gems
and
creations
of
the
tailors
art
you
little
fool
cried
lou
loudly
and
affectionately
i
see
you
are
still
working
in
that
store
and
as
shabby
as
ever
and
how
about
that
big
catch
you
were
going
to
make
nothing
doing
yet
i
suppose
and
then
lou
looked
and
saw
that
something
better
than
prosperity
had
descended
upon
nancy
something
that
shone
brighter
than
gems
in
her
eyes
and
redder
than
a
rose
in
her
cheeks
and
that
danced
like
electricity
anxious
to
be
loosed
from
the
tip
of
her
tongue
yes
i
still
in
the
store
said
nancy
but
i
going
to
leave
it
next
week
i
made
my
catch
the
biggest
catch
in
the
world
you
wo
mind
now
lou
will
you
i
going
to
be
married
to
dan
to
dan
he
my
dan
now
why
lou
around
the
corner
of
the
park
strolled
one
of
those
young
policemen
that
are
making
the
force
more
endurable
at
least
to
the
eye
he
saw
a
woman
with
an
expensive
fur
coat
and
hands
crouching
down
against
the
iron
fence
of
the
park
sobbing
turbulently
while
a
slender
working
girl
leaned
close
trying
to
console
her
but
the
gibsonian
cop
being
of
the
new
order
passed
on
pretending
not
to
notice
for
he
was
wise
enough
to
know
that
these
matters
are
beyond
help
so
far
as
the
power
he
represents
is
concerned
though
he
rap
the
pavement
with
his
nightstick
till
the
sound
goes
up
to
the
furthermost
stars
a
madison
square
arabian
night
to
carson
chalmers
in
his
apartment
near
the
square
phillips
brought
the
evening
mail
beside
the
routine
correspondence
there
were
two
items
bearing
the
same
foreign
postmark
one
of
the
incoming
parcels
contained
a
photograph
of
a
woman
the
other
contained
an
interminable
letter
over
which
chalmers
hung
absorbed
for
a
long
time
the
letter
was
from
another
woman
and
it
contained
poisoned
barbs
sweetly
dipped
in
honey
and
feathered
with
innuendoes
concerning
the
photographed
woman
chalmers
tore
this
letter
into
a
thousand
bits
and
began
to
wear
out
his
expensive
rug
by
striding
back
and
forth
upon
it
thus
an
animal
from
the
jungle
acts
when
it
is
caged
and
thus
a
caged
man
acts
when
he
is
housed
in
a
jungle
of
doubt
by
and
by
the
restless
mood
was
overcome
the
rug
was
not
an
enchanted
one
for
sixteen
feet
he
could
travel
along
it
three
thousand
miles
was
beyond
its
power
to
aid
phillips
appeared
he
never
entered
he
invariably
appeared
like
a
genie
will
you
dine
here
sir
or
out
he
asked
here
said
chalmers
and
in
half
an
hour
he
listened
glumly
to
the
january
blasts
making
an
aeolian
trombone
of
the
empty
street
wait
he
said
to
the
disappearing
genie
as
i
came
home
across
the
end
of
the
square
i
saw
many
men
standing
there
in
rows
there
was
one
mounted
upon
something
talking
why
do
those
men
stand
in
rows
and
why
are
they
there
they
are
homeless
men
sir
said
phillips
the
man
standing
on
the
box
tries
to
get
lodging
for
them
for
the
night
people
come
around
to
listen
and
give
him
money
then
he
sends
as
many
as
the
money
will
pay
for
to
some
that
is
why
they
stand
in
rows
they
get
sent
to
bed
in
order
as
they
come
by
the
time
dinner
is
served
said
chalmers
have
one
of
those
men
here
he
will
dine
with
me
began
phillips
stammering
for
the
first
time
during
his
service
choose
one
at
random
said
chalmers
you
might
see
that
he
is
reasonably
sober
and
a
certain
amount
of
cleanliness
will
not
be
held
against
him
that
is
all
it
was
an
unusual
thing
for
carson
chalmers
to
play
the
caliph
but
on
that
night
he
felt
the
inefficacy
of
conventional
antidotes
to
melancholy
something
wanton
and
egregious
something
and
arabian
he
must
have
to
lighten
his
mood
on
the
half
hour
phillips
had
finished
his
duties
as
slave
of
the
lamp
the
waiters
from
the
restaurant
below
had
whisked
aloft
the
delectable
dinner
the
dining
table
laid
for
two
glowed
cheerily
in
the
glow
of
the
candles
and
now
phillips
as
though
he
ushered
a
cardinal
or
held
in
charge
a
burglar
wafted
in
the
shivering
guest
who
had
been
haled
from
the
line
of
mendicant
lodgers
it
is
a
common
thing
to
call
such
men
wrecks
if
the
comparison
be
used
here
it
is
the
specific
one
of
a
derelict
come
to
grief
through
fire
even
yet
some
flickering
combustion
illuminated
the
drifting
hulk
his
face
and
hands
had
been
recently
washed
a
rite
insisted
upon
by
phillips
as
a
memorial
to
the
slaughtered
conventions
in
the
he
stood
a
flaw
in
the
decorous
fittings
of
the
apartment
his
face
was
a
sickly
white
covered
almost
to
the
eyes
with
a
stubble
the
shade
of
a
red
irish
setter
coat
comb
had
failed
to
control
the
pale
brown
hair
long
matted
and
conformed
to
the
contour
of
a
constantly
worn
hat
his
eyes
were
full
of
a
hopeless
tricky
defiance
like
that
seen
in
a
cur
that
is
cornered
by
his
tormentors
his
shabby
coat
was
buttoned
high
but
a
quarter
inch
of
redeeming
collar
showed
above
it
his
manner
was
singularly
free
from
embarrassment
when
chalmers
rose
from
his
chair
across
the
round
dining
table
if
you
will
oblige
me
said
the
host
i
will
be
glad
to
have
your
company
at
dinner
my
name
is
plumer
said
the
highway
guest
in
harsh
and
aggressive
tones
if
you
like
me
you
like
to
know
the
name
of
the
party
you
dining
with
i
was
going
on
to
say
continued
chalmers
somewhat
hastily
that
mine
is
chalmers
will
you
sit
opposite
plumer
of
the
ruffled
plumes
bent
his
knee
for
phillips
to
slide
the
chair
beneath
him
he
had
an
air
of
having
sat
at
attended
boards
before
phillips
set
out
the
anchovies
and
olives
good
barked
plumer
going
to
be
in
courses
is
it
all
right
my
jovial
ruler
of
bagdad
i
your
scheherezade
all
the
way
to
the
toothpicks
you
the
first
caliph
with
a
genuine
oriental
flavor
i
struck
since
frost
what
luck
and
i
was
in
line
i
finished
counting
just
as
your
welcome
emissary
arrived
to
bid
me
to
the
feast
i
had
about
as
much
chance
of
getting
a
bed
as
i
have
of
being
the
next
president
how
will
you
have
the
sad
story
of
my
life
al
raschid
a
chapter
with
each
course
or
the
whole
edition
with
the
cigars
and
coffee
the
situation
does
not
seem
a
novel

to
you
said
chalmers
with
a
smile
by
the
chin
whiskers
of
the
prophet
no

the
guest

full
of

held
up
for

with
a
loaded
meal
pointed
at
my
head
twenty
times

set

lots
of

stake
you

stand
over
you
till
they
screw
your
autobiography
out
of
you
with
foot
notes
appendix
and
unpublished
fragments
oh
i
know
what
to
do
when
i
see
victuals
coming
toward
me
in
little
old
i
strike
the
asphalt
three
times
with
my
forehead
and
get
ready
to
spiel
yarns
for
my
supper
i
claim
descent
from
the
late
tommy
tucker
who
was
forced
to
hand
out
vocal
harmony
for
his
wheaterina
and
spoopju
i
do
not
ask
your
story
said
chalmers
i
tell
you
frankly
that
it
was
a
sudden
whim
that
prompted
me
to
send
for
some
stranger
to
dine
with
me
i
assure
you
you
will
not
suffer
through
any
curiosity
of
mine
oh
fudge
exclaimed
the
guest
enthusiastically
tackling
his
soup
i
do
mind
it
a
bit
i
a
regular
oriental
magazine
with
a
red
cover
and
the
leaves
cut
when
the
caliph
walks
abroad
in
fact
we
fellows
in
the
bed
line
have
a
sort
of
union
rate
for
things
of
this
sort
somebody
always
stopping
and
wanting
to
know
what
brought
us
down
so
low
in
the
world
for
a
sandwich
and
a
glass
of
beer
i
tell
that
drink
did
it
for
corned
beef
and
cabbage
and
a
cup
of
coffee
i
give
the
story
a
sirloin
steak
and
a
quarter
for
a
bed
gets
the
wall
street
tragedy
of
the
fortune
and
the
gradual
descent
this
is
the
first
spread
of
this
kind
i
stumbled
against
i
got
a
story
to
fit
it
i
tell
you
what
chalmers
going
to
tell
you
the
truth
for
this
if
you
listen
to
it
it
be
harder
for
you
to
believe
than
the
ones
an
hour
later
the
arabian
guest
lay
back
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
while
phillips
brought
the
coffee
and
cigars
and
cleared
the
table
did
you
ever
hear
of
sherrard
plumer
he
asked
with
a
strange
smile
i
remember
the
name
said
chalmers
he
was
a
painter
i
think
of
a
good
deal
of
prominence
a
few
years
ago
five
years
said
the
guest
then
i
went
down
like
a
chunk
of
lead
i
sherrard
plumer
i
sold
the
last
portrait
i
painted
for
after
that
i
could
have
found
a
sitter
for
a
gratis
picture
what
was
the
trouble
chalmers
could
not
resist
asking
funny
thing
answered
plumer
grimly
never
quite
understood
it
myself
for
a
while
i
swam
like
a
cork
i
broke
into
the
swell
crowd
and
got
commissions
right
and
left
the
newspapers
called
me
a
fashionable
painter
then
the
funny
things
began
to
happen
whenever
i
finished
a
picture
people
would
come
to
see
it
and
whisper
and
look
queerly
at
one
another
i
soon
found
out
what
the
trouble
was
i
had
a
knack
of
bringing
out
in
the
face
of
a
portrait
the
hidden
character
of
the
original
i
do
know
how
i
did
it
i
painted
what
i
saw
but
i
know
it
did
me
some
of
my
sitters
were
fearfully
enraged
and
refused
their
pictures
i
painted
the
portrait
of
a
very
beautiful
and
popular
society
dame
when
it
was
finished
her
husband
looked
at
it
with
a
peculiar
expression
on
his
face
and
the
next
week
he
sued
for
divorce
i
remember
one
case
of
a
prominent
banker
who
sat
to
me
while
i
had
his
portrait
on
exhibition
in
my
studio
an
acquaintance
of
his
came
in
to
look
at
it
me
says
he
he
really
look
like
that
i
told
him
it
was
considered
a
faithful
likeness
never
noticed
that
expression
about
his
eyes
before
said
he
think
i
drop
downtown
and
change
my
bank
account
he
did
drop
down
but
the
bank
account
was
gone
and
so
was
banker
it
was
long
till
they
put
me
out
of
business
people
want
their
secret
meannesses
shown
up
in
a
picture
they
can
smile
and
twist
their
own
faces
and
deceive
you
but
the
picture
ca
i
could
get
an
order
for
another
picture
and
i
had
to
give
up
i
worked
as
a
newspaper
artist
for
a
while
and
then
for
a
lithographer
but
my
work
with
them
got
me
into
the
same
trouble
if
i
drew
from
a
photograph
my
drawing
showed
up
characteristics
and
expressions
that
you
could
find
in
the
photo
but
i
guess
they
were
in
the
original
all
right
the
customers
raised
lively
rows
especially
the
women
and
i
never
could
hold
a
job
long
so
i
began
to
rest
my
weary
head
upon
the
breast
of
old
booze
for
comfort
and
pretty
soon
i
was
in
the
line
and
doing
oral
fiction
for
among
the
food
bazaars
does
the
truthful
statement
weary
thee
o
caliph
i
can
turn
on
the
wall
street
disaster
stop
if
you
prefer
but
that
requires
a
tear
and
i
afraid
i
ca
hustle
one
up
after
that
good
dinner
no
no
said
chalmers
earnestly
you
interest
me
very
much
did
all
of
your
portraits
reveal
some
unpleasant
trait
or
were
there
some
that
did
not
suffer
from
the
ordeal
of
your
peculiar
brush
some
yes
said
plumer
children
generally
a
good
many
women
and
a
sufficient
number
of
men
all
people
are
bad
you
know
when
they
were
all
right
the
pictures
were
all
right
as
i
said
i
explain
it
but
i
telling
you
facts
on
chalmers
lay
the
photograph
that
he
had
received
that
day
in
the
foreign
mail
ten
minutes
later
he
had
plumer
at
work
making
a
sketch
from
it
in
pastels
at
the
end
of
an
hour
the
artist
rose
and
stretched
wearily
it
done
he
yawned
you
excuse
me
for
being
so
long
i
got
interested
in
the
job
lordy
but
i
tired
no
bed
last
night
you
know
guess
it
have
to
be
good
night
now
o
commander
of
the
faithful
chalmers
went
as
far
as
the
door
with
him
and
slipped
some
bills
into
his
hand
oh
i
take
said
plumer
all
that
included
in
the
fall
thanks
and
for
the
very
good
dinner
i
shall
sleep
on
feathers
and
dream
of
bagdad
i
hope
it
wo
turn
out
to
be
a
dream
in
the
morning
farewell
most
excellent
caliph
again
chalmers
paced
restlessly
upon
his
rug
but
his
beat
lay
as
far
from
the
table
whereon
lay
the
pastel
sketch
as
the
room
would
permit
twice
thrice
he
tried
to
approach
it
but
failed
he
could
see
the
dun
and
gold
and
brown
of
the
colors
but
there
was
a
wall
about
it
built
by
his
fears
that
kept
him
at
a
distance
he
sat
down
and
tried
to
calm
himself
he
sprang
up
and
rang
for
phillips
there
is
a
young
artist
in
this
building
he
a
reineman
do
you
know
which
is
his
apartment
top
floor
front
sir
said
phillips
go
up
and
ask
him
to
favor
me
with
his
presence
here
for
a
few
minutes
reineman
came
at
once
chalmers
introduced
himself
reineman
said
he
there
is
a
little
pastel
sketch
on
yonder
table
i
would
be
glad
if
you
will
give
me
your
opinion
of
it
as
to
its
artistic
merits
and
as
a
picture
the
young
artist
advanced
to
the
table
and
took
up
the
sketch
chalmers
half
turned
away
leaning
upon
the
back
of
a
chair
how
do
you
find
it
he
asked
slowly
as
a
drawing
said
the
artist
i
ca
praise
it
enough
it
the
work
of
a
master
bold
and
fine
and
true
it
puzzles
me
a
little
i
have
seen
any
pastel
work
near
as
good
in
years
the
face
man
the
subject
the
original
what
would
you
say
of
that
the
face
said
reineman
is
the
face
of
one
of
god
own
angels
may
i
ask
who
my
wife
shouted
chalmers
wheeling
and
pouncing
upon
the
astonished
artist
gripping
his
hand
and
pounding
his
back
she
is
traveling
in
europe
take
that
sketch
boy
and
paint
the
picture
of
your
life
from
it
and
leave
the
price
to
me
the
rubaiyat
of
a
scotch
highball
this
document
is
intended
to
strike
somewhere
between
a
temperance
lecture
and
the
bartender
guide
relative
to
the
latter
drink
shall
swell
the
theme
and
be
set
forth
in
abundance
agreeably
to
the
former
not
an
elbow
shall
be
crooked
bob
babbitt
was
off
the
stuff
which
means
as
you
will
discover
by
referring
to
the
unabridged
dictionary
of
bohemia
that
he
had
cut
out
the
booze
that
he
was
on
the
water
wagon
the
reason
for
bob
sudden
attitude
of
hostility
toward
the
demon
rum
as
the
white
ribboners
miscall
whiskey
see
the
bartender
guide
should
be
of
interest
to
reformers
and
there
is
always
hope
for
a
man
who
when
sober
will
not
concede
or
acknowledge
that
he
was
ever
drunk
but
when
a
man
will
say
in
the
apt
words
of
the
i
had
a
beautiful
skate
on
last
night
you
will
have
to
put
stuff
in
his
coffee
as
well
as
pray
for
him
one
evening
on
his
way
home
babbitt
dropped
in
at
the
broadway
bar
that
he
liked
best
always
there
were
three
or
four
fellows
there
from
the
downtown
offices
whom
he
knew
and
then
there
would
be
and
stories
and
he
would
hurry
home
to
dinner
a
little
late
but
feeling
good
and
a
little
sorry
for
the
poor
standard
oil
company
on
this
evening
as
he
entered
he
heard
some
one
say
babbitt
was
in
last
night
as
full
as
a
boiled
owl
babbitt
walked
to
the
bar
and
saw
in
the
mirror
that
his
face
was
as
white
as
chalk
for
the
first
time
he
had
looked
truth
in
the
eyes
others
had
lied
to
him
he
had
dissembled
with
himself
he
was
a
drunkard
and
had
not
known
it
what
he
had
fondly
imagined
was
a
pleasant
exhilaration
had
been
maudlin
intoxication
his
fancied
wit
had
been
drivel
his
gay
humors
nothing
but
the
noisy
vagaries
of
a
sot
but
never
again
a
glass
of
seltzer
he
said
to
the
bartender
a
little
silence
fell
upon
the
group
of
his
cronies
who
had
been
expecting
him
to
join
them
going
off
the
stuff
bob
one
of
them
asked
politely
and
with
more
formality
than
the
highballs
ever
called
forth
yes
said
babbitt
some
one
of
the
group
took
up
the
unwashed
thread
of
a
story
he
had
been
telling
the
bartender
shoved
over
a
dime
and
a
nickel
change
from
the
quarter
ungarnished
with
his
customary
smile
and
babbitt
walked
out
now
babbitt
had
a
home
and
a
wife
but
that
is
another
story
and
i
will
tell
you
that
story
which
will
show
you
a
better
habit
and
a
worse
story
than
you
could
find
in
the
man
who
invented
the
phrase
it
began
away
up
in
sullivan
county
where
so
many
rivers
and
so
much
trouble
begins
or
begin
how
would
you
say
that
it
was
july
and
jessie
was
a
summer
boarder
at
the
mountain
squint
hotel
and
bob
who
was
just
out
of
college
saw
her
one
day
and
they
were
married
in
september
that
the
tabloid
novel
one
swallow
of
water
and
it
gone
but
those
july
days
let
the
exclamation
point
expound
it
for
i
shall
not
for
particulars
you
might
read
up
on
romeo
and
juliet
and
abraham
lincoln
thrilling
sonnet
about
you
can
fool
some
of
the
people
and
darwin
works
but
one
thing
i
must
tell
you
about
both
of
them
were
mad
over
omar
rubaiyat
they
knew
every
verse
of
the
old
bluffer
by
heart
not
consecutively
but
picking
out
here
and
there
as
you
fork
the
mushrooms
in
a
steak
à
la
bordelaise
sullivan
county
is
full
of
rocks
and
trees
and
jessie
used
to
sit
on
them
and
please
be
good
used
to
sit
on
the
rocks
and
bob
had
a
way
of
standing
behind
her
with
his
hands
over
her
shoulders
holding
her
hands
and
his
face
close
to
hers
and
they
would
repeat
over
and
over
their
favorite
verses
of
the
old
they
saw
only
the
poetry
and
philosophy
of
the
lines
then
indeed
they
agreed
that
the
wine
was
only
an
image
and
that
what
was
meant
to
be
celebrated
was
some
divinity
or
maybe
love
or
life
however
at
that
time
neither
of
them
had
tasted
the
stuff
that
goes
with
a
where
was
i
oh
they
married
and
came
to
new
york
bob
showed
his
college
diploma
and
accepted
a
position
filling
inkstands
in
a
lawyer
office
at
a
week
at
the
end
of
two
years
he
had
worked
up
to
and
gotten
his
first
taste
of
bohemia
the
kind
that
wo
stand
the
borax
and
formaldehyde
tests
they
had
two
furnished
rooms
and
a
little
kitchen
to
jess
accustomed
to
the
mild
but
beautiful
savor
of
a
country
town
the
dreggy
bohemia
was
sugar
and
spice
she
hung
fish
seines
on
the
walls
of
her
rooms
and
bought
a
sideboard
and
learned
to
play
the
banjo
twice
or
thrice
a
week
they
dined
at
french
or
italian
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
brag
and
unshorn
hair
jess
learned
to
drink
a
cocktail
in
order
to
get
the
cherry
at
home
she
smoked
a
cigarette
after
dinner
she
learned
to
pronounce
chianti
and
leave
her
olive
stones
for
the
waiter
to
pick
up
once
she
essayed
to
say
la
la
la
in
a
crowd
but
got
only
as
far
as
the
second
one
they
met
one
or
two
couples
while
dining
out
and
became
friendly
with
them
the
sideboard
was
stocked
with
scotch
and
rye
and
a
liqueur
they
had
their
new
friends
in
to
dinner
and
all
were
laughing
at
nothing
by
some
plastering
fell
in
the
room
below
them
for
which
bob
had
to
pay
thus
they
footed
it
merrily
on
the
ragged
frontiers
of
the
country
that
has
no
boundary
lines
or
government
and
soon
bob
fell
in
with
his
cronies
and
learned
to
keep
his
foot
on
the
little
rail
six
inches
above
the
floor
for
an
hour
or
so
every
afternoon
before
he
went
home
drink
always
rubbed
him
the
right
way
and
he
would
reach
his
rooms
as
jolly
as
a
sandboy
jessie
would
meet
him
at
the
door
and
generally
they
would
dance
some
insane
kind
of
a
rigadoon
about
the
floor
by
way
of
greeting
once
when
bob
feet
became
confused
and
he
tumbled
headlong
over
a
jessie
laughed
so
heartily
and
long
that
he
had
to
throw
all
the
couch
pillows
at
her
to
make
her
hush
in
such
wise
life
was
speeding
for
them
on
the
day
when
bob
babbitt
first
felt
the
power
that
the
giftie
him
but
let
us
get
back
to
our
lamb
and
mint
sauce
when
bob
got
home
that
evening
he
found
jessie
in
a
long
apron
cutting
up
a
lobster
for
the
newburg
usually
when
bob
came
in
mellow
from
his
hour
at
the
bar
his
welcome
was
hilarious
though
somewhat
tinctured
with
scotch
smoke
by
screams
and
snatches
of
song
and
certain
audible
testimonials
of
domestic
felicity
was
his
advent
proclaimed
when
she
heard
his
foot
on
the
stairs
the
old
maid
in
the
hall
room
always
stuffed
cotton
into
her
ears
at
first
jessie
had
shrunk
from
the
rudeness
and
favor
of
these
spiritual
greetings
but
as
the
fog
of
the
false
bohemia
gradually
encompassed
her
she
came
to
accept
them
as
true
and
proper
greeting
bob
came
in
without
a
word
smiled
kissed
her
neatly
but
noiselessly
took
up
a
paper
and
sat
down
in
the
hall
room
the
old
maid
held
her
two
plugs
of
cotton
poised
filled
with
anxiety
jessie
dropped
lobster
and
knife
and
ran
to
him
with
frightened
eyes
what
the
matter
bob
are
you
ill
not
at
all
dear
then
what
the
matter
with
you
nothing
hearken
brethren
when
interrogates
you
concerning
a
change
she
finds
in
your
mood
answer
her
thus
tell
her
that
you
in
a
sudden
rage
have
murdered
your
grandmother
tell
her
that
you
have
robbed
orphans
and
that
remorse
has
stricken
you
tell
her
your
fortune
is
swept
away
that
you
are
beset
by
enemies
by
bunions
by
any
kind
of
malevolent
fate
but
do
not
if
peace
and
happiness
are
worth
as
much
as
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
to
you
do
not
answer
her
nothing
jessie
went
back
to
the
lobster
in
silence
she
cast
looks
of
darkest
suspicion
at
bob
he
had
never
acted
that
way
before
when
dinner
was
on
the
table
she
set
out
the
bottle
of
scotch
and
the
glasses
bob
declined
tell
you
the
truth
jess
he
said
i
cut
out
the
drink
help
yourself
of
course
if
you
do
mind
i
try
some
of
the
seltzer
straight
you
stopped
drinking
she
said
looking
at
him
steadily
and
unsmilingly
what
for
it
was
doing
me
any
good
said
bob
do
you
approve
of
the
idea
jessie
raised
her
eyebrows
and
one
shoulder
slightly
entirely
she
said
with
a
sculptured
smile
i
could
not
conscientiously
advise
any
one
to
drink
or
smoke
or
whistle
on
sunday
the
meal
was
finished
almost
in
silence
bob
tried
to
make
talk
but
his
efforts
lacked
the
stimulus
of
previous
evenings
he
felt
miserable
and
once
or
twice
his
eye
wandered
toward
the
bottle
but
each
time
the
scathing
words
of
his
bibulous
friend
sounded
in
his
ear
and
his
mouth
set
with
determination
jessie
felt
the
change
deeply
the
essence
of
their
lives
seemed
to
have
departed
suddenly
the
restless
fever
the
false
gayety
the
unnatural
excitement
of
the
shoddy
bohemia
in
which
they
had
lived
had
dropped
away
in
the
space
of
the
popping
of
a
cork
she
stole
curious
and
forlorn
glances
at
the
dejected
bob
who
bore
the
guilty
look
of
at
least
a
or
a
family
tyrant
after
dinner
the
colored
maid
who
came
in
daily
to
perform
such
chores
cleared
away
the
things
jessie
with
an
unreadable
countenance
brought
back
the
bottle
of
scotch
and
the
glasses
and
a
bowl
of
cracked
ice
and
set
them
on
the
table
may
i
ask
she
said
with
some
of
the
ice
in
her
tones
whether
i
am
to
be
included
in
your
sudden
spasm
of
goodness
if
not
make
one
for
myself
it
rather
chilly
this
evening
for
some
reason
oh
come
now
jess
said
bob
do
be
too
rough
on
me
help
yourself
by
all
means
there
no
danger
of
your
overdoing
it
but
i
thought
there
was
with
me
and
that
why
i
quit
have
yours
and
then
let
get
out
the
banjo
and
try
over
that
new
quickstep
i
heard
said
jessie
in
the
tones
of
the
oracle
that
drinking
alone
is
a
pernicious
habit
no
i
do
think
i
feel
like
playing
this
evening
if
we
are
going
to
reform
we
may
as
well
abandon
the
evil
habit
of
too
she
took
up
a
book
and
sat
in
her
little
willow
rocker
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
neither
of
them
spoke
for
half
an
hour
and
then
bob
laid
down
his
paper
and
got
up
with
a
strange
absent
look
on
his
face
and
went
behind
her
chair
and
reached
over
her
shoulders
taking
her
hands
in
his
and
laid
his
face
close
to
hers
in
a
moment
to
jessie
the
walls
of
the
room
vanished
and
she
saw
the
sullivan
county
hills
and
rills
bob
felt
her
hands
quiver
in
his
as
he
began
the
verse
from
old
omar
come
fill
the
cup
and
in
the
fire
of
spring
the
winter
garment
of
repentance
fling
the
bird
of
time
has
but
a
little
way
to
fly
and
lo
the
bird
is
on
the
wing
and
then
he
walked
to
the
table
and
poured
a
stiff
drink
of
scotch
into
a
glass
but
in
that
moment
a
mountain
breeze
had
somehow
found
its
way
in
and
blown
away
the
mist
of
the
false
bohemia
jessie
leaped
and
with
one
fierce
sweep
of
her
hand
sent
the
bottle
and
glasses
crashing
to
the
floor
the
same
motion
of
her
arm
carried
it
around
bob
neck
where
it
met
its
mate
and
fastened
tight
oh
my
god
bobbie
not
that
verse
i
see
now
i
was
always
such
a
fool
was
i
the
other
one
boy
the
one
that
says
it
to
the
heart
desire
say
that
one
the
heart
desire
i
know
that
one
said
bob
it
goes
love
could
you
and
i
with
him
conspire
to
grasp
this
sorry
scheme
of
things
entire
would
not
we
let
me
finish
it
said
jessie
not
we
shatter
it
to
bits
and
then
remould
it
nearer
to
the
heart
desire
it
shattered
all
right
said
bob
crunching
some
glass
under
his
heel
in
some
dungeon
below
the
accurate
ear
of
pickens
the
landlady
located
the
smash
it
that
wild
babbitt
coming
home
soused
again
she
said
and
he
got
such
a
nice
little
wife
too
the
pendulum
street
let
out
please
yelled
the
shepherd
in
blue
a
flock
of
citizen
sheep
scrambled
out
and
another
flock
scrambled
aboard
the
cattle
cars
of
the
manhattan
elevated
rattled
away
and
john
perkins
drifted
down
the
stairway
of
the
station
with
the
released
flock
john
walked
slowly
toward
his
flat
slowly
because
in
the
lexicon
of
his
daily
life
there
was
no
such
word
as
perhaps
there
are
no
surprises
awaiting
a
man
who
has
been
married
two
years
and
lives
in
a
flat
as
he
walked
john
perkins
prophesied
to
himself
with
gloomy
and
downtrodden
cynicism
the
foregone
conclusions
of
the
monotonous
day
katy
would
meet
him
at
the
door
with
a
kiss
flavored
with
cold
cream
and
he
would
remove
his
coat
sit
upon
a
macadamized
lounge
and
read
in
the
evening
paper
of
russians
and
japs
slaughtered
by
the
deadly
linotype
for
dinner
there
would
be
pot
roast
a
salad
flavored
with
a
dressing
warranted
not
to
crack
or
injure
the
leather
stewed
rhubarb
and
the
bottle
of
strawberry
marmalade
blushing
at
the
certificate
of
chemical
purity
on
its
label
after
dinner
katy
would
show
him
the
new
patch
in
her
crazy
quilt
that
the
iceman
had
cut
for
her
off
the
end
of
his
at
seven
they
would
spread
newspapers
over
the
furniture
to
catch
the
pieces
of
plastering
that
fell
when
the
fat
man
in
the
flat
overhead
began
to
take
his
physical
culture
exercises
exactly
at
eight
hickey
mooney
of
the
vaudeville
team
unbooked
in
the
flat
across
the
hall
would
yield
to
the
gentle
influence
of
delirium
tremens
and
begin
to
overturn
chairs
under
the
delusion
that
hammerstein
was
pursuing
them
with
a
contract
then
the
gent
at
the
window
across
the
would
get
out
his
flute
the
nightly
gas
leak
would
steal
forth
to
frolic
in
the
highways
the
dumbwaiter
would
slip
off
its
trolley
the
janitor
would
drive
zanowitski
five
children
once
more
across
the
yalu
the
lady
with
the
champagne
shoes
and
the
skye
terrier
would
trip
downstairs
and
paste
her
thursday
name
over
her
bell
and
and
the
evening
routine
of
the
frogmore
flats
would
be
under
way
john
perkins
knew
these
things
would
happen
and
he
knew
that
at
a
quarter
past
eight
he
would
summon
his
nerve
and
reach
for
his
hat
and
that
his
wife
would
deliver
this
speech
in
a
querulous
tone
now
where
are
you
going
i
like
to
know
john
perkins
thought
i
drop
up
to
mccloskey
he
would
answer
and
play
a
game
or
two
of
pool
with
the
fellows
of
late
such
had
been
john
perkins
habit
at
ten
or
eleven
he
would
return
sometimes
katy
would
be
asleep
sometimes
waiting
up
ready
to
melt
in
the
crucible
of
her
ire
a
little
more
gold
plating
from
the
wrought
steel
chains
of
matrimony
for
these
things
cupid
will
have
to
answer
when
he
stands
at
the
bar
of
justice
with
his
victims
from
the
frogmore
flats
john
perkins
encountered
a
tremendous
upheaval
of
the
commonplace
when
he
reached
his
door
no
katy
was
there
with
her
affectionate
confectionate
kiss
the
three
rooms
seemed
in
portentous
disorder
all
about
lay
her
things
in
confusion
shoes
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
curling
tongs
hair
bows
kimonos
powder
box
jumbled
together
on
dresser
and
chairs
this
was
not
way
with
a
sinking
heart
john
saw
the
comb
with
a
curling
cloud
of
her
brown
hair
among
its
teeth
some
unusual
hurry
and
perturbation
must
have
possessed
her
for
she
always
carefully
placed
these
combings
in
the
little
blue
vase
on
the
mantel
to
be
some
day
formed
into
the
coveted
feminine
rat
hanging
conspicuously
to
the
gas
jet
by
a
string
was
a
folded
paper
john
seized
it
it
was
a
note
from
his
wife
running
thus
dear
john
i
just
had
a
telegram
saying
mother
is
very
sick
i
am
going
to
take
the
train
brother
sam
is
going
to
meet
me
at
the
depot
there
there
is
cold
mutton
in
the
ice
box
i
hope
it
is
her
quinzy
again
pay
the
milkman
cents
she
had
it
bad
last
spring
do
forget
to
write
to
the
company
about
the
gas
meter
and
your
good
socks
are
in
the
top
drawer
i
will
write
hastily
katy
never
during
their
two
years
of
matrimony
had
he
and
katy
been
separated
for
a
night
john
read
the
note
over
and
over
in
a
dumbfounded
way
here
was
a
break
in
a
routine
that
had
never
varied
and
it
left
him
dazed
there
on
the
back
of
a
chair
hung
pathetically
empty
and
formless
the
red
wrapper
with
black
dots
that
she
always
wore
while
getting
the
meals
her
clothes
had
been
tossed
here
and
there
in
her
haste
a
little
paper
bag
of
her
favorite
lay
with
its
string
yet
unwound
a
daily
paper
sprawled
on
the
floor
gaping
rectangularly
where
a
railroad
had
been
clipped
from
it
everything
in
the
room
spoke
of
a
loss
of
an
essence
gone
of
its
soul
and
life
departed
john
perkins
stood
among
the
dead
remains
with
a
queer
feeling
of
desolation
in
his
heart
he
began
to
set
the
rooms
tidy
as
well
as
he
could
when
he
touched
her
clothes
a
thrill
of
something
like
terror
went
through
him
he
had
never
thought
what
existence
would
be
without
katy
she
had
become
so
thoroughly
annealed
into
his
life
that
she
was
like
the
air
he
breathed
necessary
but
scarcely
noticed
now
without
warning
she
was
gone
vanished
as
completely
absent
as
if
she
had
never
existed
of
course
it
would
be
only
for
a
few
days
or
at
most
a
week
or
two
but
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
very
hand
of
death
had
pointed
a
finger
at
his
secure
and
uneventful
home
john
dragged
the
cold
mutton
from
the
made
coffee
and
sat
down
to
a
lonely
meal
face
to
face
with
the
strawberry
shameless
certificate
of
purity
bright
among
withdrawn
blessings
now
appeared
to
him
the
ghosts
of
pot
roasts
and
the
salad
with
tan
polish
dressing
his
home
was
dismantled
a
quinzied
had
knocked
his
lares
and
penates
after
his
solitary
meal
john
sat
at
a
front
window
he
did
not
care
to
smoke
outside
the
city
roared
to
him
to
come
join
in
its
dance
of
folly
and
pleasure
the
night
was
his
he
might
go
forth
unquestioned
and
thrum
the
strings
of
jollity
as
free
as
any
gay
bachelor
there
he
might
carouse
and
wander
and
have
his
fling
until
dawn
if
he
liked
and
there
would
be
no
wrathful
katy
waiting
for
him
bearing
the
chalice
that
held
the
dregs
of
his
joy
he
might
play
pool
at
mccloskey
with
his
roistering
friends
until
aurora
dimmed
the
electric
bulbs
if
he
chose
the
hymeneal
strings
that
had
curbed
him
always
when
the
frogmore
flats
had
palled
upon
him
were
loosened
katy
was
gone
john
perkins
was
not
accustomed
to
analyzing
his
emotions
but
as
he
sat
in
his
parlor
he
hit
unerringly
upon
the
keynote
of
his
discomfort
he
knew
now
that
katy
was
necessary
to
his
happiness
his
feeling
for
her
lulled
into
unconsciousness
by
the
dull
round
of
domesticity
had
been
sharply
stirred
by
the
loss
of
her
presence
has
it
not
been
dinned
into
us
by
proverb
and
sermon
and
fable
that
we
never
prize
the
music
till
the
bird
has
flown
or
in
other
no
less
florid
and
true
utterances
i
a
dub
mused
john
perkins
the
way
i
been
treating
katy
off
every
night
playing
pool
and
bumming
with
the
boys
instead
of
staying
home
with
her
the
poor
girl
here
all
alone
with
nothing
to
amuse
her
and
me
acting
that
way
john
perkins
you
the
worst
kind
of
a
shine
i
going
to
make
it
up
for
the
little
girl
i
take
her
out
and
let
her
see
some
amusement
and
i
cut
out
the
mccloskey
gang
right
from
this
minute
yes
there
was
the
city
roaring
outside
for
john
perkins
to
come
dance
in
the
train
of
momus
and
at
mccloskey
the
boys
were
knocking
the
balls
idly
into
the
pockets
against
the
hour
for
the
nightly
game
but
no
primrose
way
nor
clicking
cue
could
woo
the
remorseful
soul
of
perkins
the
bereft
the
thing
that
was
his
lightly
held
and
half
scorned
had
been
taken
away
from
him
and
he
wanted
it
backward
to
a
certain
man
named
adam
whom
the
cherubim
bounced
from
the
orchard
could
perkins
the
remorseful
trace
his
descent
near
the
right
hand
of
john
perkins
stood
a
chair
on
the
back
of
it
stood
katy
blue
shirtwaist
it
still
retained
something
of
her
contour
midway
of
the
sleeves
were
fine
individual
wrinkles
made
by
the
movements
of
her
arms
in
working
for
his
comfort
and
pleasure
a
delicate
but
impelling
odor
of
bluebells
came
from
it
john
took
it
and
looked
long
and
soberly
at
the
unresponsive
grenadine
katy
had
never
been
unresponsive
tears
yes
tears
came
into
john
perkins
eyes
when
she
came
back
things
would
be
different
he
would
make
up
for
all
his
neglect
what
was
life
without
her
the
door
opened
katy
walked
in
carrying
a
little
hand
satchel
john
stared
at
her
stupidly
my
i
glad
to
get
back
said
katy
ma
was
sick
to
amount
to
anything
sam
was
at
the
depot
and
said
she
just
had
a
little
spell
and
got
all
right
soon
after
they
telegraphed
so
i
took
the
next
train
back
i
just
dying
for
a
cup
of
coffee
nobody
heard
the
click
and
rattle
of
the
as
the
front
of
the
frogmore
flats
buzzed
its
machinery
back
into
the
order
of
things
a
band
slipped
a
spring
was
touched
the
gear
was
adjusted
and
the
wheels
revolve
in
their
old
orbit
john
perkins
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
he
reached
for
his
hat
and
walked
to
the
door
now
where
are
you
going
i
like
to
know
john
perkins
asked
katy
in
a
querulous
tone
thought
i
drop
up
to
mccloskey
said
john
and
play
a
game
or
two
of
pool
with
the
fellows
two
thanksgiving
day
gentlemen
there
is
one
day
that
is
ours
there
is
one
day
when
all
we
americans
who
are
not
go
back
to
the
old
home
to
eat
saleratus
biscuits
and
marvel
how
much
nearer
to
the
porch
the
old
pump
looks
than
it
used
to
bless
the
day
president
roosevelt
gives
it
to
us
we
hear
some
talk
of
the
puritans
but
do
just
remember
who
they
were
bet
we
can
lick
anyhow
if
they
try
to
land
again
plymouth
rocks
well
that
sounds
more
familiar
lots
of
us
have
had
to
come
down
to
hens
since
the
turkey
trust
got
its
work
in
but
somebody
in
washington
is
leaking
out
advance
information
to
about
these
thanksgiving
proclamations
the
big
city
east
of
the
cranberry
bogs
has
made
thanksgiving
day

institution
the
last
thursday
in
november

the
only
day
in
the
year
on
which
it
recognizes
the
part
of
america
lying
across
the
ferries
it
is
the
one
day
that
is
purely
american

a
day
of
celebration
exclusively
american
and
now
for
the
story
which
is
to
prove
to
you
that
we
have
traditions
on
this
side
of
the
ocean
that
are
becoming
older
at
a
much
rapider
rate
than
those
of
england
are
thanks
to
our
and
enterprise
stuffy
pete
took
his
seat
on
the
third
bench
to
the
right
as
you
enter
union
square
from
the
east
at
the
walk
opposite
the
fountain
every
thanksgiving
day
for
nine
years
he
had
taken
his
seat
there
promptly
at
for
every
time
he
had
done
so
things
had
happened
to
him
charles
dickensy
things
that
swelled
his
waistcoat
above
his
heart
and
equally
on
the
other
side
but
stuffy
pete
appearance
at
the
annual
trysting
place
seemed
to
have
been
rather
the
result
of
habit
than
of
the
yearly
hunger
which
as
the
philanthropists
seem
to
think
afflicts
the
poor
at
such
extended
intervals
certainly
pete
was
not
hungry
he
had
just
come
from
a
feast
that
had
left
him
of
his
powers
barely
those
of
respiration
and
locomotion
his
eyes
were
like
two
pale
gooseberries
firmly
imbedded
in
a
swollen
and
mask
of
putty
his
breath
came
in
short
wheezes
a
senatorial
roll
of
adipose
tissue
denied
a
fashionable
set
to
his
upturned
coat
collar
buttons
that
had
been
sewed
upon
his
clothes
by
kind
salvation
fingers
a
week
before
flew
like
popcorn
strewing
the
earth
around
him
ragged
he
was
with
a
split
shirt
front
open
to
the
wishbone
but
the
november
breeze
carrying
fine
snowflakes
brought
him
only
a
grateful
coolness
for
stuffy
pete
was
overcharged
with
the
caloric
produced
by
a
dinner
beginning
with
oysters
and
ending
with
plum
pudding
and
including
it
seemed
to
him
all
the
roast
turkey
and
baked
potatoes
and
chicken
salad
and
squash
pie
and
ice
cream
in
the
world
wherefore
he
sat
gorged
and
gazed
upon
the
world
with
contempt
the
meal
had
been
an
unexpected
one
he
was
passing
a
red
brick
mansion
near
the
beginning
of
fifth
avenue
in
which
lived
two
old
ladies
of
ancient
family
and
a
reverence
for
traditions
they
even
denied
the
existence
of
new
york
and
believed
that
thanksgiving
day
was
declared
solely
for
washington
square
one
of
their
traditional
habits
was
to
station
a
servant
at
the
postern
gate
with
orders
to
admit
the
first
hungry
wayfarer
that
came
along
after
the
hour
of
noon
had
struck
and
banquet
him
to
a
finish
stuffy
pete
happened
to
pass
by
on
his
way
to
the
park
and
the
seneschals
gathered
him
in
and
upheld
the
custom
of
the
castle
after
stuffy
pete
had
gazed
straight
before
him
for
ten
minutes
he
was
conscious
of
a
desire
for
a
more
varied
field
of
vision
with
a
tremendous
effort
he
moved
his
head
slowly
to
the
left
and
then
his
eyes
bulged
out
fearfully
and
his
breath
ceased
and
the
ends
of
his
short
legs
wriggled
and
rustled
on
the
gravel
for
the
old
gentleman
was
coming
across
fourth
avenue
toward
his
bench
every
thanksgiving
day
for
nine
years
the
old
gentleman
had
come
there
and
found
stuffy
pete
on
his
bench
that
was
a
thing
that
the
old
gentleman
was
trying
to
make
a
tradition
of
every
thanksgiving
day
for
nine
years
he
had
found
stuffy
there
and
had
led
him
to
a
restaurant
and
watched
him
eat
a
big
dinner
they
do
those
things
in
england
unconsciously
but
this
is
a
young
country
and
nine
years
is
not
so
bad
the
old
gentleman
was
a
staunch
american
patriot
and
considered
himself
a
pioneer
in
american
tradition
in
order
to
become
picturesque
we
must
keep
on
doing
one
thing
for
a
long
time
without
ever
letting
it
get
away
from
us
something
like
collecting
the
weekly
dimes
in
industrial
insurance
or
cleaning
the
streets
the
old
gentleman
moved
straight
and
stately
toward
the
institution
that
he
was
rearing
truly
the
annual
feeding
of
stuffy
pete
was
nothing
national
in
its
character
such
as
the
magna
charta
or
jam
for
breakfast
was
in
england
but
it
was
a
step
it
was
almost
feudal
it
showed
at
least
that
a
custom
was
not
impossible
to
new
y
ahem
america
the
old
gentleman
was
thin
and
tall
and
sixty
he
was
dressed
all
in
black
and
wore
the
kind
of
glasses
that
wo
stay
on
your
nose
his
hair
was
whiter
and
thinner
than
it
had
been
last
year
and
he
seemed
to
make
more
use
of
his
big
knobby
cane
with
the
crooked
handle
as
his
established
benefactor
came
up
stuffy
wheezed
and
shuddered
like
some
woman
pug
when
a
street
dog
bristles
up
at
him
he
would
have
flown
but
all
the
skill
of
could
not
have
separated
him
from
his
bench
well
had
the
myrmidons
of
the
two
old
ladies
done
their
work
good
morning
said
the
old
gentleman
i
am
glad
to
perceive
that
the
vicissitudes
of
another
year
have
spared
you
to
move
in
health
about
the
beautiful
world
for
that
blessing
alone
this
day
of
thanksgiving
is
well
proclaimed
to
each
of
us
if
you
will
come
with
me
my
man
i
will
provide
you
with
a
dinner
that
should
make
your
physical
being
accord
with
the
mental
that
is
what
the
old
gentleman
said
every
time
every
thanksgiving
day
for
nine
years
the
words
themselves
almost
formed
an
institution
nothing
could
be
compared
with
them
except
the
declaration
of
independence
always
before
they
had
been
music
in
stuffy
ears
but
now
he
looked
up
at
the
old
gentleman
face
with
tearful
agony
in
his
own
the
fine
snow
almost
sizzled
when
it
fell
upon
his
perspiring
brow
but
the
old
gentleman
shivered
a
little
and
turned
his
back
to
the
wind
stuffy
had
always
wondered
why
the
old
gentleman
spoke
his
speech
rather
sadly
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
because
he
was
wishing
every
time
that
he
had
a
son
to
succeed
him
a
son
who
would
come
there
after
he
was
gone
a
son
who
would
stand
proud
and
strong
before
some
subsequent
stuffy
and
say
in
memory
of
my
father
then
it
would
be
an
institution
but
the
old
gentleman
had
no
relatives
he
lived
in
rented
rooms
in
one
of
the
decayed
old
family
brownstone
mansions
in
one
of
the
quiet
streets
east
of
the
park
in
the
winter
he
raised
fuchsias
in
a
little
conservatory
the
size
of
a
steamer
trunk
in
the
spring
he
walked
in
the
easter
parade
in
the
summer
he
lived
at
a
farmhouse
in
the
new
jersey
hills
and
sat
in
a
wicker
armchair
speaking
of
a
butterfly
the
ornithoptera
amphrisius
that
he
hoped
to
find
some
day
in
the
autumn
he
fed
stuffy
a
dinner
these
were
the
old
gentleman
occupations
stuffy
pete
looked
up
at
him
for
a
half
minute
stewing
and
helpless
in
his
own
the
old
gentleman
eyes
were
bright
with
the
his
face
was
getting
more
lined
each
year
but
his
little
black
necktie
was
in
as
jaunty
a
bow
as
ever
and
the
linen
was
beautiful
and
white
and
his
gray
mustache
was
curled
carefully
at
the
ends
and
then
stuffy
made
a
noise
that
sounded
like
peas
bubbling
in
a
pot
speech
was
intended
and
as
the
old
gentleman
had
heard
the
sounds
nine
times
before
he
rightly
construed
them
into
stuffy
old
formula
of
acceptance
thankee
sir
i
go
with
ye
and
much
obliged
i
very
hungry
sir
the
coma
of
repletion
had
not
prevented
from
entering
mind
the
conviction
that
he
was
the
basis
of
an
institution
his
thanksgiving
appetite
was
not
his
own
it
belonged
by
all
the
sacred
rights
of
established
custom
if
not
by
the
actual
statute
of
limitations
to
this
kind
old
gentleman
who
bad
preempted
it
true
america
is
free
but
in
order
to
establish
tradition
some
one
must
be
a
repetend
a
repeating
decimal
the
heroes
are
not
all
heroes
of
steel
and
gold
see
one
here
that
wielded
only
weapons
of
iron
badly
silvered
and
tin
the
old
gentleman
led
his
annual
protege
southward
to
the
restaurant
and
to
the
table
where
the
feast
had
always
occurred
they
were
recognized
here
comes
de
old
guy
said
a
waiter
dat
blows
dat
same
bum
to
a
meal
every
thanksgiving
the
old
gentleman
sat
across
the
table
glowing
like
a
smoked
pearl
at
his
of
future
ancient
tradition
the
waiters
heaped
the
table
with
holiday
food
and
stuffy
with
a
sigh
that
was
mistaken
for
hunger
expression
raised
knife
and
fork
and
carved
for
himself
a
crown
of
imperishable
bay
no
more
valiant
hero
ever
fought
his
way
through
the
ranks
of
an
enemy
turkey
chops
soups
vegetables
pies
disappeared
before
him
as
fast
as
they
could
be
served
gorged
nearly
to
the
uttermost
when
he
entered
the
restaurant
the
smell
of
food
had
almost
caused
him
to
lose
his
honor
as
a
gentleman
but
he
rallied
like
a
true
knight
he
saw
the
look
of
beneficent
happiness
on
the
old
gentleman
face
a
happier
look
than
even
the
fuchsias
and
the
ornithoptera
amphrisius
had
ever
brought
to
it
and
he
had
not
the
heart
to
see
it
wane
in
an
hour
stuffy
leaned
back
with
a
battle
won
thankee
kindly
sir
he
puffed
like
a
leaky
steam
pipe
thankee
kindly
for
a
hearty
meal
then
he
arose
heavily
with
glazed
eyes
and
started
toward
the
kitchen
a
waiter
turned
him
about
like
a
top
and
pointed
him
toward
the
door
the
old
gentleman
carefully
counted
out
in
silver
change
leaving
three
nickels
for
the
waiter
they
parted
as
they
did
each
year
at
the
door
the
old
gentleman
going
south
stuffy
north
around
the
first
corner
stuffy
turned
and
stood
for
one
minute
then
he
seemed
to
puff
out
his
rags
as
an
owl
puffs
out
his
feathers
and
fell
to
the
sidewalk
like
a
sunstricken
horse
when
the
ambulance
came
the
young
surgeon
and
the
driver
cursed
softly
at
his
weight
there
was
no
smell
of
whiskey
to
justify
a
transfer
to
the
patrol
wagon
so
stuffy
and
his
two
dinners
went
to
the
hospital
there
they
stretched
him
on
a
bed
and
began
to
test
him
for
strange
diseases
with
the
hope
of
getting
a
chance
at
some
problem
with
the
bare
steel
and
lo
an
hour
later
another
ambulance
brought
the
old
gentleman
and
they
laid
him
on
another
bed
and
spoke
of
appendicitis
for
he
looked
good
for
the
bill
but
pretty
soon
one
of
the
young
doctors
met
one
of
the
young
nurses
whose
eyes
he
liked
and
stopped
to
chat
with
her
about
the
cases
that
nice
old
gentleman
over
there
now
he
said
you
think
that
was
a
case
of
almost
starvation
proud
old
family
i
guess
he
told
me
he
had
eaten
a
thing
for
three
days
the
assessor
of
success
hastings
beauchamp
morley
sauntered
across
union
square
with
a
pitying
look
at
the
hundreds
that
lolled
upon
the
park
benches
they
were
a
motley
lot
he
thought
the
men
with
stolid
animal
unshaven
faces
the
women
wriggling
and
twining
and
untwining
their
feet
that
hung
four
inches
above
the
gravelled
walks
were
i
carnegie
or
rockefeller
i
would
put
a
few
millions
in
my
inside
pocket
and
make
an
appointment
with
all
the
park
commissioners
around
the
corner
if
necessary
and
arrange
for
benches
in
all
the
parks
of
the
world
low
enough
for
women
to
sit
upon
and
rest
their
feet
upon
the
ground
after
that
i
might
furnish
libraries
to
towns
that
would
pay
for

and
call

wanted
to

societies
have
been
laboring
for
many
years
after
equality
with

with
what
result
when
they
sit
on
a
bench
they
must
twist
their
ankles
together
and
uncomfortably
swing
their
highest
french
heels
clear
of
earthly
support

at
the
bottom

then

to

of

equality
hastings
beauchamp
morley
was
carefully
and
neatly
dressed
that
was
the
result
of
an
instinct
due
to
his
birth
and
breeding
it
is
denied
us
to
look
further
into
a
man
bosom
than
the
starch
on
his
shirt
front
so
it
is
left
to
us
only
to
recount
his
walks
and
conversation
morley
had
not
a
cent
in
his
pockets
but
he
smiled
pityingly
at
a
hundred
grimy
unfortunate
ones
who
had
no
more
and
who
would
have
no
more
when
the
sun
first
rays
yellowed
the
tall
building
on
the
west
side
of
the
square
but
morley
would
have
enough
by
then
sundown
had
seen
his
pockets
empty
before
but
sunrise
had
always
seen
them
lined
first
he
went
to
the
house
of
a
clergyman
off
madison
avenue
and
presented
a
forged
letter
of
introduction
that
holily
purported
to
issue
from
a
pastorate
in
indiana
this
netted
him
when
backed
up
by
a
realistic
romance
of
a
delayed
remittance
on
the
sidewalk
twenty
steps
from
the
clergyman
door
a
fat
man
huskily
enveloped
him
with
a
raised
red
fist
and
the
voice
of
a
bell
buoy
demanding
payment
of
an
old
score
why

dulcetly

four
drinks
placated
the
emotional
bergman
there
was
an
air
about
morley
when
he
was
backed
by
money
in
hand
that
would
have
stayed
off
a
call
loan
at
rothschilds
when
he
was
penniless
his
bluff
was
pitched

a

morley
walked
away
with
a
crooked
smile
on
his
pale
smooth
face
the
credulous
german
amused
him
he
would
have
to
avoid
street
in
the
future
he
had
not
been
aware
that
bergman
ever
went
home
by
that
route
at
the
door
of
a
darkened
house
two
squares
to
the
north
morley
knocked
with
a
peculiar
sequence
of
raps
the
door
opened
to
the
length
of
a
chain
and
the
pompous
important
black
face
of
an
african
guardian
imposed
itself
in
the
opening
morley
was
admitted
in
a
room
in
an
atmosphere
opaque
with
smoke
he
hung
for
ten
minutes
above
a
roulette
wheel
then
downstairs
he
crept
and
was
by
the
important
negro
jingling
in
his
pocket

cents
in
silver
that
remained
to
him
of
his
capital
at
the
corner

lingered
undecided
across
the
street
was
a
drug
store
well
lighted
sending
forth
gleams
from
the
german
silver
and
crystal
of
its
soda
fountain
and
glasses
along
came
a
youngster
of
five
headed
for
the
dispensary
stepping
high
with
the
consequence
of
a
big
errand
possibly
one
to
which
his
advancing
age
had
earned
him
promotion
in
his
hand
he
clutched
something
tightly
publicly
proudly
conspicuously
morley
stopped
him
with
his
winning
smile
and
soft
speech

druggist
with
a
wink
after
he
had
compounded
the
order
i
see
you
understand
pharmacy
a
dollar
is
the
regular
price
to
gulls
said
morley
smilingly
he
settled
the
wrapped
bottle
carefully
in
the
child
arms
and
escorted
him
to
the
corner
in
his
own
pocket
he
dropped
the
cents
accruing
to
him
by
virtue
of
his
chemical
knowledge
look
out
for
the
cars
sonny
he
said
cheerfully
to
his
small
victim
two
street
cars
suddenly
swooped
in
opposite
directions
upon
the
youngster
morley
dashed
between
them
and
pinned
the
infantile
messenger
by
the
neck
holding
him
in
safety
then
from
the
corner
of
his
street
he
sent
him
on
his
way
swindled
happy
and
sticky
with
vile
cheap
candy
from
the
italian
fruit
stand
morley
went
to
a
restaurant
and
ordered
a
sirloin
and
a
pint
of
inexpensive
chateau
breuille
he
laughed
noiselessly
but
so
genuinely
that
the
waiter
ventured
to
premise
that
good
news
had
come
his
way
why
no
said
morley
who
seldom
held
conversation
with
any
one
it
is
not
that
it
is
something
else
that
amuses
me
do
you
know
what
three
divisions
of
people
are
easiest
to
in
transactions
of
all
kinds
sure
said
the
waiter
calculating
the
size
of
the
tip
promised
by
the
careful
knot
of
morley
tie
there
the
buyers
from
the
dry
goods
stores
in
the
south
during
august
and
honeymooners
from
staten
island
and
wrong
said
morley
chuckling
happily
the
answer
is
just
men
women
and
children
the
world
well
say
new
york
and
as
far
as
summer
boarders
can
swim
out
from
long
island
is
full
of
greenhorns
two
minutes
longer
on
the
broiler
would
have
made
this
steak
fit
to
be
eaten
by
a
gentleman
francois
if
yez
it
on
de
bum
said
the
waiter
oi
morley
lifted
his
hand
in
protest
slightly
martyred
protest
it
will
do
he
said
magnanimously
and
now
green
chartreuse
frappe
and
a
morley
went
out
leisurely
and
stood
on
a
corner
where
two
tradeful
arteries
of
the
city
cross
with
a
solitary
dime
in
his
pocket
he
stood
on
the
curb
watching
with
confident
cynical
smiling
eyes
the
tides
of
people
that
flowed
past
him
into
that
stream
he
must
cast
his
net
and
draw
fish
for
his
further
sustenance
and
need
good
izaak
walton
had
not
the
half
of
his
and
a
joyful
party
of
four
two
women
and
two
men
fell
upon
him
with
cries
of
delight
there
was
a
dinner
party
on
where
had
he
been
for
a
fortnight
past
what
luck
to
thus
run
upon
him
they
surrounded
and
engulfed
him
he
must
join
them
tra
la
la
and
the
rest
one
with
a
white
hat
plume
curving
to
the
shoulder
touched
his
sleeve
and
cast
at
the
others
a
triumphant
look
that
said
see
what
i
can
do
with
him
and
added
her
queen
command
to
the
invitations
i
leave
you
to
imagine
said
morley
pathetically
how
it
desolates
me
to
forego
the
pleasure
but
my
friend
carruthers
of
the
new
york
yacht
club
is
to
pick
me
up
here
in
his
motor
car
at
the
white
plume
tossed
and
the
quartet
danced
like
midges
around
an
arc
light
down
the
frolicsome
way
morley
stood
turning
over
and
over
the
dime
in
his
pocket
and
laughing
gleefully
to
himself
he
chanted
under
his
breath
does
it
it
is
trumps
in
the
game
how
they
take
it
in
men
women
and
children
forgeries
lies
how
they
all
take
it
in
an
old
man
with
an
suit
a
straggling
gray
beard
and
a
corpulent
umbrella
hopped
from
the
conglomeration
of
cabs
and
street
cars
to
the
sidewalk
at
morley
side
stranger
said
he

morley
half
closing
his
eyes
to
veil
the
joy
in
them
you

the
old
man

interrupted
the
old
man
hopefully
a
man
sandy
complected
about
two
front
teeth
out
about
five
foot
oh
exclaimed
morley
sol
smothers
why
he
lives
in
the
next
house
to

i
thought

morley
looked
at
his
watch
you
must
have
a
watch
you
can
do
it
for
a
dollar
better
go
hungry
than
forego
a
gunmetal
or
the
one
that
the
railroads
according
to
these
watchmakers
are
run
by
the
bishop
of
long
island
said
morley
was
to
meet
me
here
at
to
dine
with
me
at
the
kingfishers
club
but
i
ca
leave
the
father
of
my
friend
sol
smothers
alone
on
the
street
by
swithin
smothers
we
wall
street
men
have
to
work
tired
is
no
name
for
it
i
was
about
to
step
across
to
the
other
corner
and
have
a
glass
of
ginger
ale
with
a
dash
of
sherry
when
you
approached
me
you
must
let
me
take
you
to
sol
house
smothers
but
before
we
take
the
car
i
hope
you
will
join
me
in
an
hour
later
morley
seated
himself
on
the
end
of
a
quiet
bench
in
madison
square
with
a
cigar
between
his
lips
and
in
deeply
creased
bills
in
his
inside
pocket
content
ironical
keenly
philosophic
he
watched
the
moon
drifting
in
and
out
amidst
a
maze
of
flying
clouds
an
old
ragged
man
with
a
head
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
bench
presently
the
old
man
stirred
and
looked
at
his
bench
companion
in
morley
appearance
he
seemed
to
recognize
something
superior
to
the
usual
nightly
occupants
of
the
benches
kind
sir
he
whined
if
you
could
spare
a
dime
or
even
a
few
pennies
to
one
who
morley
cut
short
his
stereotyped
appeal
by
throwing
him
a
dollar
god
bless
you
said
the
old
man
i
been
trying
to
find
work
for
work
echoed
morley
with
his
ringing
laugh
you
are
a
fool
my
friend
the
world
is
a
rock
to
you
no
doubt
but
you
must
be
an
aaron
and
smite
it
with
your
rod
then
things
better
than
water
will
gush
out
of
it
for
you
that
is
what
the
world
is
for
it
gives
to
me
whatever
i
want
from
it
god
has
blessed
you
said
the
old
man
it
is
only
work
that
i
have
known
and
now
i
can
get
no
more
i
must
go
home
said
morley
rising
and
buttoning
his
coat
i
stopped
here
only
for
a
smoke
i
hope
you
may
find
work
may
your
kindness
be
rewarded
this
night
said
the
old
man
oh
said
morley
you
have
your
wish
already
i
am
satisfied
i
think
good
luck
follows
me
like
a
dog
i
am
for
yonder
bright
hotel
across
the
square
for
the
night
and
what
a
moon
that
is
lighting
up
the
city
i
think
no
one
enjoys
the
moonlight
and
such
little
things
as
i
do
well
a
to
you
morley
walked
to
the
corner
where
he
would
cross
to
his
hotel
he
blew
slow
streams
of
smoke
from
his
cigar
heavenward
a
policeman
passing
saluted
to
his
benign
nod
what
a
fine
moon
it
was
the
clock
struck
nine
as
a
girl
just
entering
womanhood
stopped
on
the
corner
waiting
for
the
approaching
car
she
was
hurrying
as
if
homeward
from
employment
or
delay
her
eyes
were
clear
and
pure
she
was
dressed
in
simple
white
she
looked
eagerly
for
the
car
and
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
morley
knew
her
eight
years
before
he
had
sat
on
the
same
bench
with
her
at
school
there
had
been
no
sentiment
between
them
nothing
but
the
friendship
of
innocent
days
but
he
turned
down
the
side
street
to
a
quiet
spot
and
laid
his
suddenly
burning
face
against
the
cool
iron
of
a
and
said
dully
god
i
wish
i
could
die
the
buyer
from
cactus

it
is
well
that
hay

thousand

navarro
platt
first
introduced
pennies
west
of
the
colorado
river
they
had
been
ranchmen
with
business
heads
who
saw
that
the
world
did
not
necessarily
have
to
cease
its
revolutions
after
free
grass
went
out
every
spring
navarro
senior
partner
half
spanish
cosmopolitan
able
polished
had
gone
on
to
new
york
to
buy
goods
this
year
he
shied
at
taking
up
the
long
trail
he
was
undoubtedly
growing
older
and
he
looked
at
his
watch
several
times
a
day
before
the
hour
came
for
his
siesta
john
he
said
to
his
junior
partner
you
shall
go
on
this
year
to
buy
the
goods
platt
looked
tired
i
told
said
he
that
new
york
is
a
plumb
dead
town
but
go
i
can
take
a
whirl
in
san
antone
for
a
few
days
on
my
way
and
have
some
fun
two
weeks
later
a

in
a
texas
full
dress

black
frock
coat
soft
white
hat
and
collar
inch
high
with
black
wrought
iron
necktie
entered
the
wholesale
cloak
and
suit
establishment
of
zizzbaum
son
on
lower
broadway
old
zizzbaum
had
the
eye
of
an
osprey
the
memory
of
an
elephant
and
a
mind
that
unfolded
from
him
in
three
movements
like
the
puzzle
of
the
carpenter
rule
he
rolled
to
the
front
like
a
brunette
polar
bear
and
shook
platt
hand
and
how
is
the
good
navarro
in
texas
he
said
the
trip
was
too
long
for
him
this
year
so
we
welcome
platt
instead
a
bull
eye
said
platt
and
i
give
forty
acres
of
unirrigated
pecos
county
land
to
know
how
you
did
it
i
knew
grinned
zizzbaum
just
as
i
know
that
the
rainfall
in
el
paso
for
the
year
was
inches
or
an
increase
of
inches
and
that
therefore
navarro
platt
will
buy
a
stock
of
suits
this
spring
instead
of
as
in
a
dry
year
but
that
will
be
there
is
first
a
cigar
in
my
private
office
that
will
remove
from
your
mouth
the
taste
of
the
ones
you
smuggle
across
the
rio
grande
and
like
because
they
are
smuggled
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
business
for
the
day
had
ended
zizzbaum
left
platt
with
a
cigar
and
came
out
of
the
private
office
to
son
who
was
arranging
his
diamond
scarfpin
before
a
mirror
ready
to
leave
abey
he
said
you
will
have
to
take
platt
around
and
show
him
things
they
are
customers
for
ten
years
navarro
and
i
we
played
chess
every
moment
of
spare
time
when
he
came
that
is
good
but
platt
is
a
young
man
and
this
is
his
first
visit
to
new

tightly
on
his
pin
take
him
on
after
he
seen
the
flatiron
and
the
head
waiter
at

into
the
store
ready
to
do
business
he
had
a
bunch
of
hyacinths
pinned
on
his
lapel
zizzbaum
himself
waited
on
him
navarro
platt
were
good
customers
and
never
failed
to
take
their
discount
for
cash
and
what
did
you
think
of
our
little
town
asked
zizzbaum
with
the
fatuous
smile
of
the
manhattanite
i
should
care
to
live
in
it
said
the
texan
your
son
and
i
knocked
around
quite
a
little
last

good
water
but
cactus
city

better
lit
up
we

platt
and
a
good
many
shadows

platt
i
think

like
your
horses
best
i
have
seen
a
since
i
been
in
town
zizzbaum
led
him
up
stairs
to
show
the
samples
of
suits
ask
miss
asher
to
come
he
said
to
a
clerk
miss
asher
came
and
platt
of
navarro
platt
felt
for
the
first
time
the
wonderful
bright
light
of
romance
and
glory
descend
upon
him
he
stood
still
as
a
granite
cliff
above
the
cañon
of
the
colorado
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
she
noticed
his
look
and
flushed
a
little
which
was
contrary
to
her
custom
miss
asher
was
the
crack
model
of
zizzbaum
son
she
was
of
the
blond
type
known
as
medium
and
her
measurements
even
went
the
required
standard
a
little
better
she
had
been
at
zizzbaum
two
years
and
knew
her
business
her
eye
was
bright
but
cool
and
had
she
chosen
to
match
her
gaze
against
the
optic
of
the
famed
basilisk
that
fabulous
monster
gaze
would
have
wavered
and
softened
first
incidentally
she
knew
buyers
now
platt
said
zizzbaum
i
want
you
to
see
these
princess
gowns
in
the
light
shades
they
will
be
the
thing
in
your
climate
this
first
if
you
please
miss
asher
swiftly
in
and
out
of
the
the
prize
model
flew
each
time
wearing
a
new
costume
and
looking
more
stunning
with
every
change
she
posed
with
absolute
before
the
stricken
buyer
who
stood
and
motionless
while
zizzbaum
orated
oilily
of
the
styles
on
the
model
face
was
her
faint
impersonal
professional
smile
that
seemed
to
cover
something
like
weariness
or
contempt
when
the
display
was
over
platt
seemed
to
hesitate
zizzbaum
was
a
little
anxious
thinking
that
his
customer
might
be
inclined
to
try
elsewhere
but
platt
was
only
looking
over
in
his
mind
the
best
building
sites
in
cactus
city
trying
to
select
one
on
which
to
build
a
house
for
his

she
was
dressed
in
a
plain
filmy
black
platt
know
that
it
was
all
a
part
of
her
day
work
with
the
unobtrusive
aid
of
a
good
waiter
he
managed
to
order
a
respectable
dinner
minus
the
usual
broadway
preliminaries
miss
asher
flashed
upon
him
a
dazzling
smile
may
i
have
something
to
drink
she
asked
why
certainly
said
platt
anything

want
a
dry
martini
she
said
to
the
waiter
when
it
was
brought
and
set
before
her
platt
reached
over
and
took
it
away
what
is
this
he
asked

cocktail

thought

was
some
kind
of
tea

ordered

is
liquor

your
first
name

miss
asher
freezingly

is
listen
helen
said
platt
leaning
over
the
table
for
many
years
every
time
the
spring
flowers
blossomed
out
on
the
prairies
i
got
to
thinking
of
somebody
that
i
never
seen
or
heard
of
i
knew
it
was
you
the
minute
i
saw
you
yesterday
i
going
back
home
and
you
going
with
me
i
know
it
for
i
saw
it
in
your
eyes
when
you
first
looked
at
me
you
need
kick
for
you
got
to
fall
into
line
here
a
little
trick
i
picked
out
for
you
on
my
way
over
he
flicked
a
diamond
solitaire
ring
across
the
table
miss
asher
flipped
it
back
to
him
with
her
fork
do
get
fresh
she
said
severely
i
worth
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
said
platt
i
build
you
the
finest
house
in
west
texas
you
ca
buy
me
mr
buyer
said
miss
asher
if
you
had
a
hundred
million
i
did
think
i
have
to
call
you
down
you
did
look
like
the
others
to
me
at
first
but
i
see
you
all
alike
all
who
asked
platt
all
you
buyers
you
think
because
we
girls
have
to
go
out
to
dinner
with
you
or
lose
our
jobs
that
you
privileged
to
say
what
you
please
well
forget
it
i
thought
you
were
different
from
the
others
but
i
see
i
was
mistaken
platt
struck
his
fingers
on
the
table
with
a
gesture
of
sudden
illuminating
satisfaction
i
got
it
he
exclaimed
almost
hilariously
the
nicholson
place
over
on
the
north
side
there
a
big
grove
of
live
oaks
and
a
natural
lake
the
old
house
can
be
pulled
down
and
the
new
one
set
further
back
put
out
your
pipe
said
miss
asher
i
sorry
to
wake
you
up
but
you
fellows
might
as
well
get
wise
once
for
all
to
where
you
stand
i
supposed
to
go
to
dinner
with
you
and
help
jolly
you
along
so
you
trade
with
old
zizzy
but
do
expect
to
find
me
in
any
of
the
suits
you
buy
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
said
platt
that
you
go
out
this
way
with
customers
and
they
all
they
all
talk
to
you
like
i
have
they
all
make
plays
said
miss
asher
but
i
must
say
that
got
beat
in
one
respect
they
generally
talk
diamonds
while
you
actually
dug
one
up
how
long
have
you
been
working
helen
got
my
name
pat
have
you
i
been
supporting
myself
for
eight
years
i
was
a
cash
girl
and
a
wrapper
and
then
a
shop
girl
until
i
was
grown
and
then
i
got
to
be
a
suit
model
texas
man
you
think
a
little
wine
would
make
this
dinner
a
little
less
dry
you
not
going
to
drink
wine
any
more
dear
it
awful
to
think
how
i
come
to
the
store
and
get
you
i
want
you
to
pick
out
an
automobile
before
we
leave
that
all
we
need
to
buy
here
oh
cut
that
out
if
you
knew
how
sick
i
am
of
hearing
such
talk
after
the
dinner
they
walked
down
broadway
and
came
upon
little
wooded
park
the
trees
caught
platt
eye
at
once
and
he
must
turn
along
under
the
winding
walk
beneath
them
the
lights
shone
upon
two
bright
tears
in
the
model
eyes
i
do
like
that
said
platt
what
the
matter
do
you
mind
said
miss
asher
well
it
because
well
i
did
think
you
were
that
kind
when
i
first
saw
you
but
you
are
all
like
and
now
will
you
take
me
home
or
will
i
have
to
call
a
cop
platt
took
her
to
the
door
of
her
they
stood
for
a
minute
in
the
vestibule
she
looked
at
him
with
such
scorn
in
her
eyes
that
even
his
heart
of
oak
began
to
waver
his
arm
was
half
way
around
her
waist
when
she
struck
him
a
stinging
blow
on
the
face
with
her
open
hand
as
he
stepped
back
a
ring
fell
from
somewhere
and
bounded
on
the
tiled
floor
platt
groped
for
it
and
found
it
now
take
your
useless
diamond
and
go
mr
buyer
she
said
this
was
the
other
one
the
wedding
ring
said
the
texan
holding
the
smooth
gold
band
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
miss
asher
eyes
blazed
upon
him
in
the
half
darkness
was
that
what
you
meant
did
you
somebody
opened
the
door
from
inside
the
house
said
platt
i
see
you
at
the
store
miss
asher
ran
up
to
her
room
and
shook
the
school
teacher
until
she
sat
up
in
bed
ready
to
scream
fire
where
is
it
she
cried
that
what
i
want
to
know
said
the
model
you
studied
geography
emma
and
you
ought
to
know
where
is
a
town
called
cac
cac
carac
caracas
city
i
think
they
called
it
how
dare
you
wake
me
up
for
that
said
the
school
teacher
caracas
is
in
venezuela
of
course
what
it
like
why
it
principally
earthquakes
and
negroes
and
monkeys
and
malarial
fever
and
volcanoes
i
do
care
said
miss
asher
blithely
i
going
there
the
badge
of
policeman
it
can
not
be
denied
that
men
and
women
have
looked
upon
one
another
for
the
first
time
and
become
instantly
enamored
it
is
a
risky
process
this
love
at
first
sight
before
she
has
seen
him
in
bradstreet
or
he
has
seen
her
in
curl
papers
but
these
things
do
happen
and
one
instance
must
form
a
theme
for
this
story
though
not
thank
heaven
to
the
overshadowing
of
more
vital
and
important
subjects
such
as
drink
policemen
horses
and
earldoms
during
a
certain
war
a
troop
calling
itself
the
gentle
riders
rode
into
history
and
one
or
two
ambuscades
the
gentle
riders
were
recruited
from
the
aristocracy
of
the
wild
men
of
the
west
and
the
wild
men
of
the
aristocracy
of
the
east
in
khaki
there
is
little
telling
them
one
from
another
so
they
became
good
friends
and
comrades
all
around
ellsworth
remsen
whose
old
knickerbocker
descent
atoned
for
his
modest
rating
at
only
ten
millions
ate
his
canned
beef
gayly
by
the
campfires
of
the
gentle
riders
the
war
was
a
great
lark
to
him
so
that
he
scarcely
regretted
polo
and
planked
shad
one
of
the
troopers
was
a
well
set
up
affable
cool
young
man
who
called
himself
to
this
young
man
remsen
took
an
especial
liking
the
two
rode
side
by
side
during
the
famous
mooted
charge
that
was
disputed
so
hotly
at
the
time
by
the
spaniards
and
afterward
by
the
democrats
after
the
war
remsen
came
back
to
his
polo
and
shad
one
day
a
well
set
up
affable
cool
young
man
disturbed
him
at
his
club
and
he
and
were
soon
pounding
each
other
and
exchanging
opprobrious
epithets
after
the
manner
of
friends
looked
seedy
and
out
of
luck
and
perfectly
contented
but
it
seemed
that
his
content
was
only
apparent
get
me
a
job
remsen
he
said
i
just
handed
a
barber
my
last
shilling
no
trouble
at
all
said
remsen
i
know
a
lot
of
men
who
have
banks
and
stores
and
things
downtown
any
particular
line
you
fancy
yes
said
with
a
look
of
interest
i
took
a
walk
in
your
central
park
this
morning
i
like
to
be
one
of
those
bobbies
on
horseback
that
would
be
about
the
ticket
besides
it
the
only
thing
i
could
do
i
can
ride
a
little
and
the
fresh
air
suits
me
think
you
could
land
that
for
me
remsen
was
sure
that
he
could
and
in
a
very
short
time
he
did
and
they
who
were
not
above
looking
at
mounted
policemen
might
have
seen
a
well
set
up
affable
cool
young
man
on
a
prancing
chestnut
steed
attending
to
his
duties
along
the
driveways
of
the
park
and
now
at
the
extreme
risk
of
wearying
old
gentlemen
who
carry
leather
fob
chains
and
elderly
ladies
who
but
no
grandmother
herself
yet
thrills
at
foolish
immortal
romeo
there
must
be
a
hint
of
love
at
first
sight
it
came
just
as
remsen
was
strolling
into
fifth
avenue
from
his
club
a
few
doors
away
a
motor
car
was
creeping
along
foot
by
foot
impeded
by
a
freshet
of
vehicles
that
filled
the
street
in
the
car
was
a
chauffeur
and
an
old
gentleman
with
snowy
side
whiskers
and
a
scotch
plaid
cap
which
could
not
be
worn
while
automobiling
except
by
a
personage
not
even
a
wine
agent
would
dare
do
it
but
these
two
were
of
no
consequence
except
perhaps
for
the
guiding
of
the
machine
and
the
paying
for
it
at
the
old
gentleman
side
sat
a
young
lady
more
beautiful
than
pomegranate
blossoms
more
exquisite
than
the
first
quarter
moon
viewed
at
twilight
through
the
tops
of
oleanders
remsen
saw
her
and
knew
his
fate
he
could
have
flung
himself
under
the
very
wheels
that
conveyed
her
but
he
knew
that
would
be
the
last
means
of
attracting
the
attention
of
those
who
ride
in
motor
cars
slowly
the
auto
passed
and
if
we
place
the
poets
above
the
autoists
carried
the
heart
of
remsen
with
it
here
was
a
large
city
of
millions
and
many
women
who
at
a
certain
distance
appear
to
resemble
pomegranate
blossoms
yet
he
hoped
to
see
her
again
for
each
one
fancies
that
his
romance
has
its
own
tutelary
guardian
and
divinity
luckily
for
remsen
peace
of
mind
there
came
a
diversion
in
the
guise
of
a
reunion
of
the
gentle
riders
of
the
city
there
were
not
many
of
them
perhaps
a
score
and
there
was
wassail
and
things
to
eat
and
speeches
and
the
spaniard
was
bearded
again
in
recapitulation
and
when
daylight
threatened
them
the
survivors
prepared
to
depart
but
some
remained
upon
the
battlefield
one
of
these
was
trooper
who
was
not
seasoned
to
potent
liquids
his
legs
declined
to
fulfil
the
obligations
they
had
sworn
to
the
police
department
i
stewed
remsen
said
to
his
friend
why
do
they
build
hotels
that
go
round
and
round
like
catherine
wheels
they
take
away
my
shield
and
break
me
i
can
think
and
talk
but
i
with
my
feet
got
to
go
on
duty
in
three
hours
the
jig
is
up
remsen
the
jig
is
up
i
tell
you
look
at
me
said
remsen
who
was
his
smiling
self
pointing
to
his
own
face
whom
do
you
see
here
goo
fellow
said
dizzily
goo
old
remsen
not
so
said
remsen
you
see
mounted
policeman
look
at
your
face
no
you
ca
do
that
without
a
glass
but
look
at
mine
and
think
of
yours
how
much
alike
are
we
as
two
french
dinners
with
your
badge
on
your
horse
in
your
uniform
will
i
charm
and
prevent
the
grass
from
growing
under
people
feet
in
the
park
this
day
i
will
have
your
badge
and
your
honor
besides
having
the
jolliest
lark
i
been
blessed
with
since
we
licked
spain
promptly
on
time
the
counterfeit
presentment
of
mounted
policeman
into
the
park
on
his
chestnut
steed
in
a
uniform
two
men
who
are
unlike
will
look
alike
two
who
somewhat
resemble
each
other
in
feature
and
figure
will
appear
as
twin
brothers
so
remsen
trotted
down
the
bridle
paths
enjoying
himself
hugely
so
few
real
pleasures
do
have
along
the
driveway
in
the
early
morning
spun
a
victoria
drawn
by
a
pair
of
fiery
bays
there
was
something
foreign
about
the
affair
for
the
park
is
rarely
used
in
the
morning
except
by
unimportant
people
who
love
to
be
healthy
poor
and
wise
in
the
vehicle
sat
an
old
gentleman
with
snowy
and
a
scotch
plaid
cap
which
could
not
be
worn
while
driving
except
by
a
personage
at
his
side
sat
the
lady
of
remsen
heart
the
lady
who
looked
like
pomegranate
blossoms
and
the
gibbous
moon
remsen
met
them
coming
at
the
instant
of
their
passing
her
eyes
looked
into
his
and
but
for
the
ever
coward
heart
of
a
true
lover
he
could
have
sworn
that
she
flushed
a
faint
pink
he
trotted
on
for
twenty
yards
and
then
wheeled
his
horse
at
the
sound
of
runaway
hoofs
the
bays
had
bolted
remsen
sent
his
chestnut
after
the
victoria
like
a
shot
there
was
work
cut
out
for
the
impersonator
of
policeman
the
chestnut
ranged
alongside
the
off
bay
thirty
seconds
after
the
chase
began
rolled
his
eye
back
at
remsen
and
said
in
the
only
manner
open
to
policemen
horses
well
you
duffer
are
you
going
to
do
your
share
you
not
but
it
seems
to
me
if
you
lean
to
the
right
you
could
reach
the
reins
of
that
foolish
bay
ah
you
all
right
could
have
done
it
more
neatly
the
runaway
team
was
tugged
to
an
inglorious
halt
by
tough
muscles
the
driver
released
his
hands
from
the
wrapped
reins
jumped
from
his
seat
and
stood
at
the
heads
of
the
team
the
chestnut
approving
his
new
rider
danced
and
pranced
reviling
equinely
the
subdued
bays
remsen
lingering
was
dimly
conscious
of
a
vague
impossible
unnecessary
old
gentleman
in
a
scotch
cap
who
talked
incessantly
about
something
and
he
was
acutely
conscious
of
a
pair
of
violet
eyes
that
would
have
drawn
saint
pyrites
from
his
iron
pillar
or
whatever
the
allusion
is
and
of
the
lady
smile
and
look
a
little
frightened
but
a
look
that
with
the
ever
coward
heart
of
a
true
lover
he
could
not
yet
construe
they
were
asking
his
name
and
bestowing
upon
him
wellbred
thanks
for
his
heroic
deed
and
the
scotch
cap
was
especially
babbling
and
insistent
but
the
eloquent
appeal
was
in
the
eyes
of
the
lady
a
little
thrill
of
satisfaction
ran
through
remsen
because
he
had
a
name
to
give
which
without
undue
pride
was
worthy
of
being
spoken
in
high
places
and
a
small
fortune
which
with
due
pride
he
could
leave
at
his
end
without
disgrace
he
opened
his
lips
to
speak
and
closed
them
again
who
was
he
mounted
policeman
the
badge
and
the
honor
of
his
comrade
were
in
his
hands
if
ellsworth
remsen
and
knickerbocker
had
just
rescued
pomegranate
blossoms
and
scotch
cap
from
possible
death
where
was
policeman
off
his
beat
exposed
disgraced
discharged
love
had
come
but
before
that
there
had
been
something
that
demanded
precedence
the
fellowship
of
men
on
battlefields
fighting
an
alien
foe
remsen
touched
his
cap
looked
between
the
chestnut
ears
and
took
refuge
in
vernacularity
do
mention
it
he
said
stolidly
we
policemen
are
paid
to
do
these
things
it
our
duty
and
he
rode
away
rode
away
cursing
but
knowing
he
could
never
have
done
anything
else
at
the
end
of
the
day
remsen
sent
the
chestnut
to
his
stable
and
went
to
room
the
policeman
was
again
a
well
set
up
affable
cool
young
man
who
sat
by
the
window
smoking
cigars
i
wish
you
and
the
rest
of
the
police
force
and
all
badges
horses
brass
buttons
and
men
who
ca
drink
two
glasses
of
without
getting
upset
were
at
the
devil
said
remsen
feelingly
smiled
with
evident
satisfaction
good
old
remsen
he
said
affably
i
know
all
about
it
they
trailed
me
down
and
cornered
me
here
two
hours
ago
there
was
a
little
row
at
home
you
know
and
i
cut
sticks
just
to
show
them
i
do
believe
i
told
you
that
my
governor
was
the
earl
of
ardsley
funny
you
should
bob
against
them
in
the
park
if
you
damaged
that
horse
of
mine
i
never
forgive
you
i
going
to
buy
him
and
take
him
back
with
me
oh
yes
and
i
think
my
sister
lady
angela
you
know
wants
particularly
for
you
to
come
up
to
the
hotel
with
me
this
evening
did
lose
my
badge
did
you
remsen
i
got
to
turn
that
in
at
headquarters
when
i
resign
brickdust
row
blinker
was
displeased
a
man
of
less
culture
and
poise
and
wealth
would
have
sworn
but
blinker
always
remembered
that
he
was
a
gentleman
a
thing
that
no
gentleman
should
do
so
he
merely
looked
bored
and
sardonic
while
he
rode
in
a
hansom
to
the
center
of
disturbance
which
was
the
broadway
office
of
lawyer
oldport
who
was
agent
for
the
blinker
estate
i
do
see
said
blinker
why
i
should
be
always
signing
confounded
papers
i
am
packed
and
was
to
have
left
for
the
north
woods
this
morning
now
i
must
wait
until
morning
i
hate
night
trains
my
best
razors
are
of
course
at
the
bottom
of
some
unidentifiable
trunk
it
is
a
plot
to
drive
me
to
bay
rum
and
a
monologueing
barber
give
me
a
pen
that
scratch
i
hate
pens
that
scratch
sit
down
said
gray
lawyer
oldport
the
worst
has
not
been
told
you
oh
the
hardships
of
the
rich
the
papers
are
not
yet
ready
to
sign
they
will
be
laid
before
you
at
eleven
you
will
miss
another
day
twice
shall
the
barber
tweak
the
helpless
nose
of
a
blinker
be
thankful
that
your
sorrows
do
not
embrace
a
haircut
if
said
blinker
rising
the
act
did
not
involve
more
signing
of
papers
i
would
take
my
business
out
of
your
hands
at
once
give
me
a
cigar
please
if
said
lawyer
oldport
i
had
cared
to
see
an
old
friend
son
gulped
down
at
one
mouthful
by
sharks
i
would
have
ordered
you
to
take
it
away
long
ago
now
let
quit
fooling
alexander
besides
the
grinding
task
of
signing
your
name
some
thirty
times
i
must
impose
upon
you
the
consideration
of
a
matter
of
business
of
business
and
i
may
say
humanity
or
right
i
spoke
to
you
about
this
five
years
ago
but
you
would
not
listen
you
were
in
a
hurry
for
a
coaching
trip
i
think
the
subject
has
come
up
again
the
property
oh
property
interrupted
blinker
dear
oldport
i
think
you
mentioned
let
have
it
all
at
one
dose
signatures
and
property
and
snappy
rubber
bands
and
that
smelly
and
all
have
luncheon
with
me
well
i
try
to
remember
to
drop
in
at
eleven
morning
the
blinker
wealth
was
in
lands
tenements
and
hereditaments
as
the
legal
phrase
goes
lawyer
oldport
had
once
taken
alexander
in
his
little
pulmonary
gasoline
runabout
to
see
the
many
buildings
and
rows
of
buildings
that
he
owned
in
the
city
for
alexander
was
sole
heir
they
had
amused
blinker
very
much
the
houses
looked
so
incapable
of
producing
the
big
sums
of
money
that
lawyer
oldport
kept
piling
up
in
banks
for
him
to
spend
in
the
evening
blinker
went
to
one
of
his
clubs
intending
to
dine
nobody
was
there
except
some
old
fogies
playing
whist
who
spoke
to
him
with
grave
politeness
and
glared
at
him
with
savage
contempt
everybody
was
out
of
town
but
here
he
was
kept
in
like
a
schoolboy
to
write
his
name
over
and
over
on
pieces
of
paper
his
wounds
were
deep
blinker
turned
his
back
on
the
fogies
and
said
to
the
club
steward
who
had
come
forward
with
some
nonsense
about
cold
fresh
salmon
roe
symons
i
going
to
coney
island
he
said
it
as
one
might
say
all
off
i
going
to
jump
into
the
river
the
joke
pleased
symons
he
laughed
within
a
sixteenth
of
a
note
of
the
audibility
permitted
by
the
laws
governing
employees
certainly
sir
he
tittered
of
course
sir
i
think
i
can
see
you
at
coney
mr
blinker
blinker
got
a
pager
and
looked
up
the
movements
of
sunday
steamboats
then
he
found
a
cab
at
the
first
corner
and
drove
to
a
north
river
pier
he
stood
in
line
as
democratic
as
you
or
i
and
bought
a
ticket
and
was
trampled
upon
and
shoved
forward
until
at
last
he
found
himself
on
the
upper
deck
of
the
boat
staring
brazenly
at
a
girl
who
sat
alone
upon
a
camp
stool
but
blinker
did
not
intend
to
be
brazen
the
girl
was
so
wonderfully
good
looking
that
he
forgot
for
one
minute
that
he
was
the
prince
incog
and
behaved
just
as
he
did
in
society
she
was
looking
at
him
too
and
not
severely
a
puff
of
wind
threatened
blinker
straw
hat
he
caught
it
warily
and
settled
it
again
the
movement
gave
the
effect
of
a
bow
the
girl
nodded
and
smiled
and
in
another
instant
he
was
seated
at
her
side
she
was
dressed
all
in
white
she
was
paler
than
blinker
imagined
milkmaids
and
girls
of
humble
stations
to
be
but
she
was
as
tidy
as
a
cherry
blossom
and
her
steady
supremely
frank
gray
eyes
looked
out
from
the
intrepid
depths
of
an
unshadowed
and
untroubled
soul
how
dare
you
raise
your
hat
to
me
she
asked
with
a
severity
i
did
blinker
said
but
he
quickly
covered
the
mistake
by
extending
it
to
i
did
know
how
to
keep
from
it
after
i
saw
you
i
do
not
allow
gentlemen
to
sit
by
me
to
whom
i
have
not
been
introduced
she
said
with
a
sudden
haughtiness
that
deceived
him
he
rose
reluctantly
but
her
clear
teasing
laugh
brought
him
down
to
his
chair
again
i
guess
you
were
going
far
she
declared
with
magnificent
are
you
going
to
coney
island
asked
blinker
me
she
turned
upon
him
eyes
full
of
bantering
surprise
why
what
a
question
ca
you
see
that
i
riding
a
bicycle
in
the
park
her
drollery
took
the
form
of
impertinence
and
i
am
laying
brick
on
a
tall
factory
chimney
said
blinker
may
we
see
coney
together
i
all
alone
and
i
never
been
there
before
it
depends
said
the
girl
on
how
nicely
you
behave
i
consider
your
application
until
we
get
there
blinker
took
pains
to
provide
against
the
rejection
of
his
application
he
strove
to
please
to
adopt
the
metaphor
of
his
nonsensical
phrase
he
laid
brick
upon
brick
on
the
tall
chimney
of
his
devoirs
until
at
length
the
structure
was
stable
and
complete
the
manners
of
the
best
society
come
around
finally
to
simplicity
and
as
the
girl
way
was
that
naturally
they
were
on
a
mutual
plane
of
communication
from
the
beginning
he
learned
that
she
was
twenty
and
her
name
was
florence
that
she
trimmed
hats
in
a
millinery
shop
that
she
lived
in
a
furnished
room
with
her
best
chum
ella
who
was
cashier
in
a
shoe
store
and
that
a
glass
of
milk
from
the
bottle
on
the
and
an
egg
that
boils
itself
while
you
twist
up
your
hair
makes
a
breakfast
good
enough
for
any
one
florence
laughed
when
she
heard
blinker
well
she
said
it
certainly
shows
that
you
have
imagination
it
gives
the
a
chance
for
a
little
rest
anyhow
they
landed
at
coney
and
were
dashed
on
the
crest
of
a
great
human
wave
of
mad
into
the
walks
and
avenues
of
fairyland
gone
into
vaudeville
with
a
curious
eye
a
critical
mind
and
a
fairly
withheld
judgment
blinker
considered
the
temples
pagodas
and
kiosks
of
popularized
delights
hoi
polloi
trampled
hustled
and
crowded
him
basket
parties
bumped
him
sticky
children
tumbled
howling
under
his
feet
candying
his
clothes
insolent
youths
strolling
among
the
booths
with
canes
under
one
arm
and
easily
won
girls
on
the
other
blew
defiant
smoke
from
cheap
cigars
into
his
face
the
publicity
gentlemen
with
megaphones
each
before
his
own
stupendous
attraction
roared
like
niagara
in
his
ears
music
of
all
kinds
that
could
be
tortured
from
brass
reed
hide
or
string
fought
in
the
air
to
gain
space
for
its
vibrations
against
its
competitors
but
what
held
blinker
in
awful
fascination
was
the
mob
the
multitude
the
proletariat
shrieking
struggling
hurrying
panting
hurling
itself
in
incontinent
frenzy
with
unabashed
abandon
into
the
ridiculous
sham
palaces
of
trumpery
and
tinsel
pleasures
the
vulgarity
of
it
its
brutal
overriding
of
all
the
tenets
of
repression
and
taste
that
were
held
by
his
caste
repelled
him
strongly
in
the
midst
of
his
disgust
he
turned
and
looked
down
at
florence
by
his
side
she
was
ready
with
her
quick
smile
and
upturned
happy
eyes
as
bright
and
clear
as
the
water
in
trout
pools
the
eyes
were
saying
that
they
had
the
right
to
be
shining
and
happy
for
was
their
owner
not
with
her
for
the
present
man
her
gentleman
friend
and
holder
of
the
keys
to
the
enchanted
city
of
fun
blinker
did
not
read
her
look
accurately
but
by
some
miracle
he
suddenly
saw
coney
aright
he
no
longer
saw
a
mass
of
vulgarians
seeking
gross
joys
he
now
looked
clearly
upon
a
hundred
thousand
true
idealists
their
offenses
were
wiped
out
counterfeit
and
false
though
the
garish
joys
of
these
spangled
temples
were
he
perceived
that
deep
under
the
gilt
surface
they
offered
saving
and
apposite
balm
and
satisfaction
to
the
restless
human
heart
here
at
least
was
the
husk
of
romance
the
empty
but
shining
casque
of
chivalry
the
though
dip
and
flight
of
adventure
the
magic
carpet
that
transports
you
to
the
realms
of
fairyland
though
its
journey
be
through
but
a
few
poor
yards
of
space
he
no
longer
saw
a
rabble
but
his
brothers
seeking
the
ideal
there
was
no
magic
of
poesy
here
or
of
art
but
the
glamour
of
their
imagination
turned
yellow
calico
into
cloth
of
gold
and
the
megaphones
into
the
silver
trumpets
of
joy
heralds
almost
humbled
blinker
rolled
up
the
shirt
sleeves
of
his
mind
and
joined
the
idealists
you
are
the
lady
doctor
he
said
to
florence
how
shall
we
go
about
doing
this
jolly
conglomeration
of
fairy
tales
incorporated
we
will
begin
there
said
the
princess
pointing
to
a
fun
pagoda
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
we
will
take
them
all
in
one
by
one
they
caught
the
eight
returning
boat
and
sat
filled
with
pleasant
fatigue
against
the
rail
in
the
bow
listening
to
the
italians
fiddle
and
harp
blinker
had
thrown
off
all
care
the
north
woods
seemed
to
him
an
uninhabitable
wilderness
what
a
fuss
he
had
made
over
signing
his
name
pooh
he
could
sign
it
a
hundred
times
and
her
name
was
as
pretty
as
she
was
florence
he
said
it
to
himself
a
great
many
times
as
the
boat
was
nearing
its
pier
in
the
north
river
a
drab
steamer
was
dropping
down
toward
the
bay
the
boat
turned
its
nose
in
toward
its
slip
the
steamer
veered
as
if
to
seek
midstream
and
then
yawed
seemed
to
increase
its
speed
and
struck
the
coney
boat
on
the
side
near
the
stern
cutting
into
it
with
a
terrifying
shock
and
crash
while
the
six
hundred
passengers
on
the
boat
were
mostly
tumbling
about
the
decks
in
a
shrieking
panic
the
captain
was
shouting
at
the
steamer
that
it
should
not
back
off
and
leave
the
rent
exposed
for
the
water
to
enter
but
the
steamer
tore
its
way
out
like
a
savage
sawfish
and
cleaved
its
heartless
way
full
speed
ahead
the
boat
began
to
sink
at
its
stern
but
moved
slowly
toward
the
slip
the
passengers
were
a
frantic
mob
unpleasant
to
behold
blinker
held
florence
tightly
until
the
boat
had
righted
itself
she
made
no
sound
or
sign
of
fear
he
stood
on
a
camp
stool
ripped
off
the
slats
above
his
head
and
pulled
down
a
number
of
the
life
preservers
he
began
to
buckle
one
around
florence
the
rotten
canvas
split
and
the
fraudulent
granulated
cork
came
pouring
out
in
a
stream
florence
caught
a
handful
of
it
and
laughed
gleefully
it
looks
like
breakfast
food
she
said
take
it
off
they
no
good
she
unbuckled
it
and
threw
it
on
the
deck
she
made
blinker
sit
down
and
sat
by
his
side
and
put
her
hand
in
his
what
you
bet
we
do
reach
the
pier
all
right
she
said
and
began
to
hum
a
song
and
now
the
captain
moved
among
the
passengers
and
compelled
order
the
boat
would
undoubtedly
make
her
slip
he
said
and
ordered
the
women
and
children
to
the
bow
where
they
could
land
first
the
boat
very
low
in
the
water
at
the
stern
tried
gallantly
to
make
his
promise
good
florence
said
blinker
as
she
held
him
close
by
an
arm
and
hand
i
love
you
that
what
they
all
say
she
replied
lightly
i
am
not
one
of
all
he
persisted
i
never
knew
any
one
i
could
love
before
i
could
pass
my
life
with
you
and
be
happy
every
day
i
am
rich
i
can
make
things
all
right
for
you
that
what
they
all
say
said
the
girl
again
weaving
the
words
into
her
little
reckless
song
do
say
that
again
said
blinker
in
a
tone
that
made
her
look
at
him
in
frank
surprise
why
should
i
say
it
she
asked
calmly
they
all
do
who
are
he
asked
jealous
for
the
first
time
in
his
existence
why
the
fellows
i
know
do
you
know
so
many
oh
well
i
not
a
wall
flower
she
answered
with
modest
complacency
where
do
you
see
these
these
men
at
your
home
of
course
not
i
meet
them
just
as
i
did
you
sometimes
on
the
boat
sometimes
in
the
park
sometimes
on
the
street
i
a
pretty
good
judge
of
a
man
i
can
tell
in
a
minute
if
a
fellow
is
one
who
is
likely
to
get
fresh
what
do
you
mean
by
why
try
to
kiss
you
me
i
mean
do
any
of
them
try
that
asked
blinker
clenching
his
teeth
sure
all
men
do
you
know
that
do
you
allow
them
some
not
many
they
wo
take
you
out
anywhere
unless
you
do
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
searchingly
at
blinker
her
eyes
were
as
innocent
as
a
child
there
was
a
puzzled
look
in
them
as
though
she
did
not
understand
him
what
wrong
about
my
meeting
fellows
she
asked
wonderingly
everything
he
answered
almost
savagely
why
do
you
entertain
your
company
in
the
house
where
you
live
is
it
necessary
to
pick
up
tom
dick
and
harry
on
the
streets
she
kept
her
absolutely
ingenuous
eyes
upon
his
if
you
could
see
the
place
where
i
live
you
would
ask
that
i
live
in
brickdust
row
they
call
it
that
because
there
red
dust
from
the
bricks
crumbling
over
everything
i
lived
there
for
more
than
four
years
there
no
place
to
receive
company
you
ca
have
anybody
come
to
your
room
what
else
is
there
to
do
a
girl
has
got
to
meet
the
men
has
she
yes
he
said
hoarsely
a
girl
has
got
to
meet
a
has
got
to
meet
the
men
the
first
time
one
spoke
to
me
on
the
street
she
continued
i
ran
home
and
cried
all
night
but
you
get
used
to
it
i
meet
a
good
many
nice
fellows
at
church
i
go
on
rainy
days
and
stand
in
the
vestibule
until
one
comes
up
with
an
umbrella
i
wish
there
was
a
parlor
so
i
could
ask
you
to
call
blinker
are
you
really
sure
it
is
now
the
boat
landed
safely
blinker
had
a
confused
impression
of
walking
with
the
girl
through
quiet
crosstown
streets
until
she
stopped
at
a
corner
and
held
out
her
hand
i
live
just
one
more
block
over
she
said
thank
you
for
a
very
pleasant
afternoon
blinker
muttered
something
and
plunged
northward
till
he
found
a
cab
a
big
gray
church
loomed
slowly
at
his
right
blinker
shook
his
fist
at
it
through
the
window
i
gave
you
a
thousand
dollars
last
week
he
cried
under
his
breath
and
she
meets
them
in
your
very
doors
there
is
something
wrong
there
is
something
wrong
at
eleven
the
next
day
blinker
signed
his
name
thirty
times
with
a
new
pen
provided
by
lawyer
oldport
now
let
me
go
to
the
woods
he
said
surlily
you
are
not
looking
well
said
lawyer
oldport
the
trip
will
do
you
good
but
listen
if
you
will
to
that
little
matter
of
business
of
which
i
spoke
to
you
yesterday
and
also
five
years
ago
there
are
some
buildings
fifteen
in
number
of
which
there
are
new
leases
to
be
signed
your
father
contemplated
a
change
in
the
lease
provisions
but
never
made
it
he
intended
that
the
parlors
of
these
houses
should
not
be
but
that
the
tenants
should
be
allowed
to
use
them
for
reception
rooms
these
houses
are
in
the
shopping
district
and
are
mainly
tenanted
by
young
working
girls
as
it
is
they
are
forced
to
seek
companionship
outside
this
row
of
red
brick
blinker
interrupted
him
with
a
loud
discordant
laugh
brickdust
row
for
an
even
hundred
he
cried
and
i
own
it
have
i
guessed
right
the
tenants
have
some
such
name
for
it
said
lawyer
oldport
blinker
arose
and
jammed
his
hat
down
to
his
eyes
do
what
you
please
with
it
he
said
harshly
remodel
it
burn
it
raze
it
to
the
ground
but
man
it
too
late
i
tell
you
it
too
late
it
too
late
it
too
late
the
making
of
a
new
yorker
besides
many
other
things
raggles
was
a
poet
he
was
called
a
tramp
but
that
was
only
an
elliptical
way
of
saying
that
he
was
a
philosopher
an
artist
a
traveller
a
naturalist
and
a
discoverer
but
most
of
all
he
was
a
poet
in
all
his
life
he
never
wrote
a
line
of
verse
he
lived
his
poetry
his
odyssey
would
have
been
a
limerick
had
it
been
written
but
to
linger
with
the
primary
proposition
raggles
was
a
poet
raggles
specialty
had
he
been
driven
to
ink
and
paper
would
have
been
sonnets
to
the
cities
he
studied
cities
as
women
study
their
reflections
in
mirrors
as
children
study
the
glue
and
sawdust
of
a
dislocated
doll
as
the
men
who
write
about
wild
animals
study
the
cages
in
the
zoo
a
city
to
raggles
was
not
merely
a
pile
of
bricks
and
mortar
peopled
by
a
certain
number
of
inhabitants
it
was
a
thing
with
a
soul
characteristic
and
distinct
an
individual
conglomeration
of
life
with
its
own
peculiar
essence
flavor
and
feeling
two
thousand
miles
to
the
north
and
south
east
and
west
raggles
wandered
in
poetic
fervor
taking
the
cities
to
his
breast
he
footed
it
on
dusty
roads
or
sped
magnificently
in
freight
cars
counting
time
as
of
no
account
and
when
he
had
found
the
heart
of
a
city
and
listened
to
its
secret
confession
he
strayed
on
restless
to
another
fickle
raggles
but
perhaps
he
had
not
met
the
civic
corporation
that
could
engage
and
hold
his
critical
fancy
through
the
ancient
poets
we
have
learned
that
the
cities
are
feminine
so
they
were
to
poet
raggles
and
his
mind
carried
a
concrete
and
clear
conception
of
the
figure
that
symbolized
and
typified
each
one
that
he
had
wooed
chicago
seemed
to
swoop
down
upon
him
with
a
breezy
suggestion
of
partington
plumes
and
patchouli
and
to
disturb
his
rest
with
a
soaring
and
beautiful
song
of
future
promise
but
raggles
would
awake
to
a
sense
of
shivering
cold
and
a
haunting
impression
of
ideals
lost
in
a
depressing
aura
of
potato
salad
and
fish
thus
chicago
affected
him
perhaps
there
is
a
vagueness
and
inaccuracy
in
the
description
but
that
is
raggles
fault
he
should
have
recorded
his
sensations
in
magazine
poems
pittsburg
impressed
him
as
the
play
of
othello
performed
in
the
russian
language
in
a
railroad
station
by
dockstader
minstrels
a
royal
and
generous
lady
this
pittsburg
though
homely
hearty
with
flushed
face
washing
the
dishes
in
a
silk
dress
and
white
kid
slippers
and
bidding
raggles
sit
before
the
roaring
fireplace
and
drink
champagne
with
his
pigs
feet
and
fried
potatoes
new
orleans
had
simply
gazed
down
upon
him
from
a
balcony
he
could
see
her
pensive
starry
eyes
and
catch
the
flutter
of
her
fan
and
that
was
all
only
once
he
came
face
to
face
with
her
it
was
at
dawn
when
she
was
flushing
the
red
bricks
of
the
banquette
with
a
pail
of
water
she
laughed
and
hummed
a
chansonette
and
filled
raggles
shoes
with
water
allons
boston
construed
herself
to
the
poetic
raggles
in
an
erratic
and
singular
way
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
drunk
cold
tea
and
that
the
city
was
a
white
cold
cloth
that
had
been
bound
tightly
around
his
brow
to
spur
him
to
some
unknown
but
tremendous
mental
effort
and
after
all
he
came
to
shovel
snow
for
a
livelihood
and
the
cloth
becoming
wet
tightened
its
knots
and
could
not
be
removed
indefinite
and
unintelligible
ideas
you
will
say
but
your
disapprobation
should
be
tempered
with
gratitude
for
these
are
poets
fancies
and
suppose
you
had
come
upon
them
in
verse
one
day
raggles
came
and
laid
siege
to
the
heart
of
the
great
city
of
manhattan
she
was
the
greatest
of
all
and
he
wanted
to
learn
her
note
in
the
scale
to
taste
and
appraise
and
classify
and
solve
and
label
her
and
arrange
her
with
the
other
cities
that
had
given
him
up
the
secret
of
their
individuality
and
here
we
cease
to
be
raggles
translator
and
become
his
chronicler
raggles
landed
from
a
one
morning
and
walked
into
the
core
of
the
town
with
the
blasé
air
of
a
cosmopolite
he
was
dressed
with
care
to
play
the
rôle
of
an
unidentified
man
no
country
race
class
clique
union
party
clan
or
bowling
association
could
have
claimed
him
his
clothing
which
had
been
donated
to
him
by
citizens
of
different
height
but
same
number
of
inches
around
the
heart
was
not
yet
as
uncomfortable
to
his
figure
as
those
speciments
of
raiment
that
are
railroaded
to
you
by
transcontinental
tailors
with
a
suit
case
suspenders
silk
handkerchief
and
pearl
studs
as
a
bonus
without
money
as
a
poet
should
be
but
with
the
ardor
of
an
astronomer
discovering
a
new
star
in
the
chorus
of
the
milky
way
or
a
man
who
has
seen
ink
suddenly
flow
from
his
fountain
pen
raggles
wandered
into
the
great
city
late
in
the
afternoon
he
drew
out
of
the
roar
and
commotion
with
a
look
of
dumb
terror
on
his
countenance
he
was
defeated
puzzled
discomfited
frightened
other
cities
had
been
to
him
as
long
primer
to
read
as
country
maidens
quickly
to
fathom
as
rebuses
to
solve
as
oyster
cocktails
to
swallow
but
here
was
one
as
cold
glittering
serene
impossible
as
a
diamond
in
a
window
to
a
lover
outside
fingering
damply
in
his
pocket
his
salary
the
greetings
of
the
other
cities
he
had
known
their
homespun
kindliness
their
human
gamut
of
rough
charity
friendly
curses
garrulous
curiosity
and
easily
estimated
credulity
or
indifference
this
city
of
manhattan
gave
him
no
clue
it
was
walled
against
him
like
a
river
of
adamant
it
flowed
past
him
in
the
streets
never
an
eye
was
turned
upon
him
no
voice
spoke
to
him
his
heart
yearned
for
the
clap
of
pittsburg
sooty
hand
on
his
shoulder
for
chicago
menacing
but
social
yawp
in
his
ear
for
the
pale
and
eleemosynary
stare
through
the
bostonian
eyeglass
even
for
the
precipitate
but
unmalicious
of
louisville
or
louis
on
broadway
raggles
successful
suitor
of
many
cities
stood
bashful
like
any
country
swain
for
the
first
time
he
experienced
the
poignant
humiliation
of
being
ignored
and
when
he
tried
to
reduce
this
brilliant
swiftly
changing
city
to
a
formula
he
failed
utterly
poet
though
he
was
it
offered
him
no
color
similes
no
points
of
comparison
no
flaw
in
its
polished
facets
no
handle
by
which
he
could
hold
it
up
and
view
its
shape
and
structure
as
he
familiarly
and
often
contemptuously
had
done
with
other
towns
the
houses
were
interminable
ramparts
loopholed
for
defense
the
people
were
bright
but
bloodless
spectres
passing
in
sinister
and
selfish
array
the
thing
that
weighed
heaviest
on
raggles
soul
and
clogged
his
poet
fancy
was
the
spirit
of
absolute
egotism
that
seemed
to
saturate
the
people
as
toys
are
saturated
with
paint
each
one
that
he
considered
appeared
a
monster
of
abominable
and
insolent
conceit
humanity
was
gone
from
them
they
were
toddling
idols
of
stone
and
varnish
worshipping
themselves
and
greedy
for
though
oblivious
of
worship
from
their
fellow
graven
images
frozen
cruel
implacable
impervious
cut
to
an
identical
pattern
they
hurried
on
their
ways
like
statues
brought
by
some
miracles
to
motion
while
soul
and
feeling
lay
unaroused
in
the
reluctant
marble
gradually
raggles
became
conscious
of
certain
types
one
was
an
elderly
gentleman
with
a
short
beard
pink
unwrinkled
face
and
stony
sharp
blue
eyes
attired
in
the
fashion
of
a
gilded
youth
who
seemed
to
personify
the
city
wealth
ripeness
and
frigid
unconcern
another
type
was
a
woman
tall
beautiful
clear
as
a
steel
engraving
calm
clothed
like
the
princesses
of
old
with
eyes
as
coldly
blue
as
the
reflection
of
sunlight
on
a
glacier
and
another
was
a
of
this
town
of
marionettes
a
broad
swaggering
grim
threateningly
sedate
fellow
with
a
jowl
as
large
as
a
harvested
wheat
field
the
complexion
of
a
baptized
infant
and
the
knuckles
of
a
this
type
leaned
against
cigar
signs
and
viewed
the
world
with
frappéd
contumely
a
poet
is
a
sensitive
creature
and
raggles
soon
shrivelled
in
the
bleak
embrace
of
the
undecipherable
the
chill
ironical
illegible
unnatural
ruthless
expression
of
the
city
left
him
downcast
and
bewildered
had
it
no
heart
better
the
woodpile
the
scolding
of
housewives
at
back
doors
the
kindly
spleen
of
bartenders
behind
provincial
counters
the
amiable
truculence
of
rural
constables
the
kicks
arrests
and
chances
of
the
other
vulgar
loud
crude
cities
than
this
freezing
heartlessness
raggles
summoned
his
courage
and
sought
alms
from
the
populace
unheeding
regardless
they
passed
on
without
the
wink
of
an
eyelash
to
testify
that
they
were
conscious
of
his
existence
and
then
he
said
to
himself
that
this
fair
but
pitiless
city
of
manhattan
was
without
a
soul
that
its
inhabitants
were
manikins
moved
by
wires
and
springs
and
that
he
was
alone
in
a
great
wilderness
raggles
started
to
cross
the
street
there
was
a
blast
a
roar
a
hissing
and
a
crash
as
something
struck
him
and
hurled
him
over
and
over
six
yards
from
where
he
had
been
as
he
was
coming
down
like
the
stick
of
a
rocket
the
earth
and
all
the
cities
thereof
turned
to
a
fractured
dream
raggles
opened
his
eyes
first
an
odor
made
itself
known
to
him
an
odor
of
the
earliest
spring
flowers
of
paradise
and
then
a
hand
soft
as
a
falling
petal
touched
his
brow
bending
over
him
was
the
woman
clothed
like
the
princess
of
old
with
blue
eyes
now
soft
and
humid
with
human
sympathy
under
his
head
on
the
pavement
were
silks
and
furs
with
raggles
hat
in
his
hand
and
with
his
face
pinker
than
ever
from
a
vehement
burst
of
oratory
against
reckless
driving
stood
the
elderly
gentleman
who
personified
the
city
wealth
and
ripeness
from
a
nearby
café
hurried
the
with
the
vast
jowl
and
baby
complexion
bearing
a
glass
full
of
a
crimson
fluid
that
suggested
delightful
possibilities
drink
dis
sport
said
the
holding
the
glass
to
raggles
lips
hundreds
of
people
huddled
around
in
a
moment
their
faces
wearing
the
deepest
concern
two
flattering
and
gorgeous
policemen
got
into
the
circle
and
pressed
back
the
overplus
of
samaritans
an
old
lady
in
a
black
shawl
spoke
loudly
of
camphor
a
newsboy
slipped
one
of
his
papers
beneath
raggles
elbow
where
it
lay
on
the
muddy
pavement
a
brisk
young
man
with
a
notebook
was
asking
for
names
a
bell
clanged
importantly
and
the
ambulance
cleaned
a
lane
through
the
crowd
a
cool
surgeon
slipped
into
the
midst
of
affairs
how
do
you
feel
old
man
asked
the
surgeon
stooping
easily
to
his
task
the
princess
of
silks
and
satins
wiped
a
red
drop
or
two
from
raggles
brow
with
a
fragrant
cobweb
me
said
raggles
with
a
seraphic
smile
i
feel
fine
he
had
found
the
heart
of
his
new
city
in
three
days
they
let
him
leave
his
cot
for
the
convalescent
ward
in
the
hospital
he
had
been
in
there
an
hour
when
the
attendants
heard
sounds
of
conflict
upon
investigation
they
found
that
raggles
had
assaulted
and
damaged
a
brother
convalescent
a
glowering
transient
whom
a
freight
train
collision
had
sent
in
to
be
patched
up
what
all
this
about
inquired
the
head
nurse
he
was
runnin
down

said
raggles

was
sent
to

withdrew
from

with

and
your

the
stovepipe
gang
borrowed
its
name
from
a
of
the
city
called
the
stovepipe
which
is
a
narrow
and
natural
extension
of
the
familiar
district
known
as
hell
kitchen
the
stovepipe
strip
of
town
runs
along
eleventh
and
twelfth
avenues
on
the
river
and
bends
a
hard
and
sooty
elbow
around
little
lost
homeless
dewitt
clinton
park
consider
that
a
stovepipe
is
an
important
factor
in
any
kitchen
and
the
situation
is
analyzed
the
chefs
in
kitchen
are
many
and
the
stovepipe
gang
wears
the
cordon
blue
the
members
of
this
unchartered
but
widely
known
brotherhood
appeared
to
pass
their
time
on
street
corners
arrayed
like
the
lilies
of
the
conservatory
and
busy
with
nail
files
and
penknives
thus
displayed
as
a
guarantee
of
good
faith
they
carried
on
an
innocuous
conversation
in
a
vocabulary
to
the
casual
observer
as
innocent
and
immaterial
as
that
heard
in
clubs
seven
blocks
to
the
east
but
off
exhibition
the
stovepipes
were
not
mere
street
corner
ornaments
addicted
to
posing
and
manicuring
their
serious
occupation
was
the
separating
of
citizens
from
their
coin
and
valuables
preferably
this
was
done
by
weird
and
singular
tricks
without
noise
or
bloodshed
but
whenever
the
citizen
honored
by
their
attentions
refused
to
impoverish
himself
gracefully
his
objections
came
to
be
spread
finally
upon
some
police
station
blotter
or
hospital
register
the
police
held
the
stovepipe
gang
in
perpetual
suspicion
and
respect
as
the
nightingale
liquid
note
is
heard
in
the
deepest
shadows
so
along
the
stovepipe
dark
and
narrow
confines
the
whistle
for
reserves
punctures
the
dull
ear
of
night
whenever
there
was
smoke
in
the
stovepipe
the
tasselled
men
in
blue
knew
there
was
fire
in
hell
kitchen
kid
brady
promised
molly
to
be
good
kid
was
the
vainest
the
strongest
the
wariest
and
the
most
successful
plotter
in
the
gang
therefore
the
boys
were
sorry
to
give
him
up
but
they
witnessed
his
fall
to
a
virtuous
life
without
protest
for
in
the
kitchen
it
is
considered
neither
unmanly
nor
improper
for
a
guy
to
do
as
his
girl
advises
black
her
eye
for
love
sake
if
you
will
but
it
is
business
to
do
a
thing
when
she
wants
you
to
do
it
turn
off
the
hydrant
said
the
kid
one
night
when
molly
tearful
besought
him
to
amend
his
ways
i
going
to
cut
out
the
gang
you
for
mine
and
the
simple
life
on
the
side
i
tell
you
moll

work
and
in
a
year
we
get
married
i
do
it
for
you

a
flat
and
a
flute
and
a
sewing
machine
and
a
rubber
plant
and
live
as
honest
as
we
can
oh
kid
sighed
molly
wiping
the
powder
off
his
shoulder
with
her
handkerchief
i
rather
hear
you
say
that
than
to
own
all
of
new
york
and
we
can
be
happy
on
so
little
the
kid
looked
down
at
his
speckless
cuffs
and
shining
patent
leathers
with
a
suspicion
of
melancholy
it
hurt
hardest
in
the
rags
department
said
he
i
kind
of
always
liked
to
rig
out
swell
when
i
could
you
know
how
i
hate
cheap
things
moll
this
suit
set
me
back
anything
in
the
wearing
apparel
line
has
got
to
be
just
so
or
it
to
the
misfit
parlors
for
it
for
mine
if
i
work
i
wo
have
so
much
coin
to
hand
over
to
the
little
man
with
the
big
shears
never
mind
kid
i
like
you
just
as
much
in
a
blue
jumper
as
i
would
in
a
red
automobile
before
the
kid
had
grown
large
enough
to
knock
out
his
father
he
had
been
compelled
to
learn
the
plumber
art
so
now
back
to
this
honorable
and
useful
profession
he
returned
but
it
was
as
an
assistant
that
he
engaged
himself
and
it
is
the
master
plumber
and
not
the
assistant
who
wears
diamonds
as
large
as
hailstones
and
looks
contemptuously
upon
the
marble
colonnades
of
senator
mansion
eight
months
went
by
as
smoothly
and
surely
as
though
they
had
elapsed
on
a
theater
program
the
kid
worked
away
at
his
pipes
and
solder
with
no
symptoms
of
backsliding
the
stovepipe
gang
continued
its
piracy
on
the
high
avenues
cracked
policemen
heads
held
up
late
travelers
invented
new
methods
of
peaceful
plundering
copied
fifth
avenue
cut
of
clothes
and
neckwear
fancies
and
comported
itself
according
to
its
lawless
bylaws
but
the
kid
stood
firm
and
faithful
to
his
molly
even
though
the
polish
was
gone
from
his
fingernails
and
it
took
him
minutes
to
tie
his
purple
silk
ascot
so
that
the
worn
places
would
not
show
one
evening
he
brought
a
mysterious
bundle
with
him
to
house
open
that
moll
he
said
in
his
large
quiet
way
it
for
you
molly
eager
fingers
tore
off
the
wrappings
she
shrieked
aloud
and
in
rushed
a
sprinkling
of
little
mckeevers
and
ma
mckeever
dishwashy
but
an
undeniable
relative
of
the
late
eve
again
molly
shrieked
and
something
dark
and
long
and
sinuous
flew
and
enveloped
her
neck
like
an
anaconda
russian
sables
said
the
kid
pridefully
enjoying
the
sight
of
molly
round
cheek
against
the
clinging
fur
the
real
thing
they
do
grow
anything
in
russia
too
good
for
you
moll
molly
plunged
her
hands
into
the
muff
overturned
a
row
of
the
family
infants
and
flew
to
the
mirror

for
the

to
make
bright
eyes
rosy
checks
and
a
bewitching
smile
recipe
one
set
russian
sables
apply
when
they
were
alone
molly
became
aware
of
a
small
cake
of
the
ice
of
common
sense
floating
down
the
full
tide
of
her
happiness
you
a
bird
all
right
kid
she
admitted
gratefully
i
never
had
any
furs
on

in
my
life
but

expensive
seems
to
me
i
heard

i
ever
chucked

asked
the
kid
with
calm
dignity
did
you
ever
notice

leaning
on
the
remnant
counter
or
peering
in
the
window
of
the
call
that
scarf
and
the
muff
and
you

make
any
mistake
about
the
price
of
russian
sables
the
swell
goods
for
me
say
they
look
fine
on
you
moll
molly
hugged
the
sables
to
her
bosom
in
rapture
and
then
her
smile
went
away
little
by
little
and
she
looked
the
kid
straight
in
the
eye
sadly
and
steadily
he
knew
what
every
look
of
hers
meant
and
he
laughed
with
a
faint
flush
upon
his
face
cut
it
out
he
said
with
affectionate
roughness
i
told
you
i
was
done
with
that
i
bought
and
paid
for
all
right

my
own
money

i
told

molly
calmed
her
doubts
sables
are
soothing
proud
as
a
queen
she
went
forth
in
the
streets
at
the
kid
side
in
all
that
region
of
streets
russian
sables
had
never
been
seen
before
the
word
sped
and
doors
and
windows
blossomed
with
heads
eager
to
see
the
swell
furs
kid
brady
had
given
his
girl
all
down
the
street
there
were
oh
and
ah
and
the
reported
fabulous
sum
paid
for
the
sables
was
passed
from
lip
to
lip
increasing
as
it
went
at
her
right
elbow
sauntered
the
kid
with
the
air
of
princes
work
had
not
diminished
his
love
of
pomp
and
show
and
his
passion
for
the
costly
and
genuine
on
a
corner
they
saw
a
group
of
the
stovepipe
gang
loafing
immaculate
they
raised
their
hats
to
the
kid
girl
and
went
on
with
their
calm
unaccented
palaver
three
blocks
behind
the
admired
couple

was
fair

and
unafraid
and
went
there
with
the
hypothesis
that
the
inhabitants
were
human
many
liked
him
and
now
and
then
one
would
tip
off
to
him
something
that

apprentices
nowadays
at

ikey
toiled
and
snipped
and
basted
and
pressed
and
patched
and
sponged
all
day
in
the
steamy
fetor
of
a
but
when
work
was
done
ikey
hitched
his
wagon
to
such
stars
as
his
firmament
let
shine
it
was
saturday
night
and
the
boss
laid
twelve
begrimed
and
begrudged
dollars
in
his
hand
ikey
dabbled
discreetly
in
water
donned
coat
hat
and
collar
with
its
frazzled
tie
and
chalcedony
pin
and
set
forth
in
pursuit
of
his
ideals
for
each
of
us
when
our
day
work
is
done
must
seek
our
ideal
whether
it
be
love
or
pinochle
or
lobster
à
la
newburg
or
the
sweet
silence
of
the
musty
bookshelves
behold
ikey
as
he
ambles
up
the
street
beneath
the
roaring
el
between
the
rows
of
reeking
pallid
stooping
insignificant
squalid
doomed
to
exist
forever
in
penury
of
body
and
mind
yet
as
he
swings
his
cheap
cane
and
projects
the
noisome
inhalations
from
his
cigarette
you
perceive
that
he
nurtures
in
his
narrow
bosom
the
bacillus
of
society
ikey
legs
carried
him
to
and
into
that
famous
place
of
entertainment
known
as
the
café
maginnis
famous
because
it
was
the
rendezvous
of
billy
mcmahan
the
greatest
man
the
most
wonderful
man
ikey
thought
that
the
world
had
ever
produced
billy
mcmahan
was
the
district
leader
upon
him
the
tiger
purred
and
his
hand
held
manna
to
scatter
now
as
ikey
entered
mcmahan
stood
flushed
and
triumphant
and
mighty
the
centre
of
a
huzzaing
concourse
of
his
lieutenants
and
constituents
it
seems
there
had
been
an
election
a
signal
victory
had
been
won
the
city
had
been
swept
back
into
line
by
a
resistless
besom
of
ballots
ikey
slunk
along
the
bar
and
gazed
at
his
idol
how
magnificent
was
billy
mcmahan
with
his
great
smooth
laughing
face
his
gray
eye
shrewd
as
a
chicken
hawk
his
diamond
ring
his
voice
like
a
bugle
call
his
prince
air
his
plump
and
active
roll
of
money
his
clarion
call
to
friend
and
comrade
oh
what
a
king
of
men
he
was
how
he
obscured
his
lieutenants
though
they
themselves
loomed
large
and
serious
blue
of
chin
and
important
of
mien
with
hands
buried
deep
in
the
pockets
of
their
short
overcoats
but
billy
oh
what
small
avail
are
words
to
paint
for
you
his
glory
as
seen
by
ikey
snigglefritz
the
café
maginnis
rang
to
the
note
of
victory
the
bartenders
threw
themselves
featfully
upon
bottle
cork
and
glass
from
a
score
of
clear
havanas
the
air
received
its
paradox
of
clouds
the
leal
and
the
hopeful
shook
billy
mcmahan
hand
and
there
was
born
suddenly
in
the
worshipful
soul
of
ikey
snigglefritz
an
audacious
thrilling
impulse
he
stepped
forward
into
the
little
cleared
space
in
which
majesty
moved
and
held
out
his
hand
billy
mcmahan
grasped
it
unhesitatingly
shook
it
and
smiled
made
mad
now
by
the
gods
who
were
about
to
destroy
him
ikey
threw
away
his
scabbard
and
charged
upon
olympus
have
a
drink
with
me
billy
he
said
familiarly
you
and
your
friends
do
mind
if
i
do
old
man
said
the
great
leader
just
to
keep
the
ball
rolling
the
last
spark
of
ikey
reason
fled
wine
he
called
to
the
bartender
waving
a
trembling
hand
the
corks
of
three
bottles
were
drawn
the
champagne
bubbled
in
the
long
row
of
glasses
set
upon
the
bar
billy
mcmahan
took
his
and
nodded
with
his
beaming
smile
at
ikey
the
lieutenants
and
satellites
took
theirs
and
growled
here
to
you
ikey
took
his
nectar
in
delirium
all
drank
ikey
threw
his
week
wages
in
a
crumpled
roll
upon
the
bar
said
the
bartender
smoothing
the
twelve
notes
the
crowd
surged
around
billy
mcmahan
again
some
one
was
telling
how
brannigan
fixed
over
in
the
eleventh
ikey
leaned
against
the
bar
a
while
and
then
went
out
he
went
down
hester
street
and
up
chrystie
and
down
delancey
to
where
he
lived
and
there
his
women
folk
a
bibulous
mother
and
three
dingy
sisters
pounced
upon
him
for
his
wages
and
at
his
confession
they
shrieked
and
objurgated
him
in
the
pithy
rhetoric
of
the
locality
but
even
as
they
plucked
at
him
and
struck
him
ikey
remained
in
his
ecstatic
trance
of
joy
his
head
was
in
the
clouds
the
star
was
drawing
his
wagon
compared
with
what
he
had
achieved
the
loss
of
wages
and
the
bray
of
women
tongues
were
slight
affairs
he
had
shaken
the
hand
of
billy
mcmahan
billy
mcmahan
had
a
wife
and
upon
her
visiting
cards
was
engraved
the
name
william
darragh
mcmahan
and
there
was
a
certain
vexation
attendant
upon
these
cards
for
small
as
they
were
there
were
houses
in
which
they
could
not
be
inserted
billy
mcmahan
was
a
dictator
in
politics
a
tower
in
business
a
mogul
dreaded
loved
and
obeyed
among
his
own
people
he
was
growing
rich
the
daily
papers
had
a
dozen
men
on
his
trail
to
chronicle
his
every
word
of
wisdom
he
had
been
honored
in
caricature
holding
the
tiger
cringing
in
leash
but
the
heart
of
billy
was
sometimes
sore
within
him
there
was
a
race
of
men
from
which
he
stood
apart
but
that
he
viewed
with
the
eye
of
moses
looking
over
into
the
promised
land
he
too
had
ideals
even
as
had
ikey
snigglefritz
and
sometimes
hopeless
of
attaining
them
his
own
solid
success
was
as
dust
and
ashes
in
his
mouth
and
william
darragh
mcmahan
wore
a
look
of
discontent
upon
her
plump
but
pretty
face
and
the
very
rustle
of
her
silks
seemed
a
sigh
there
was
a
brave
and
conspicuous
assemblage
in
the
dining
saloon
of
a
noted
hostelry
where
fashion
loves
to
display
her
charms
at
one
table
sat
billy
mcmahan
and
his
wife
mostly
silent
they
were
but
the
accessories
they
enjoyed
little
needed
the
indorsement
of
speech
mcmahan
diamonds
were
outshone
by
few
in
the
room
the
waiter
bore
the
costliest
brands
of
wine
to
their
table
in
evening
dress
with
an
expression
of
gloom
upon
his
smooth
and
massive
countenance
you
would
look
in
vain
for
a
more
striking
figure
than
billy
four
tables
away
sat
alone
a
tall
slender
man
about
thirty
with
thoughtful
melancholy
eyes
a
van
dyke
beard
and
peculiarly
white
thin
hands
he
was
dining
on
filet
mignon
dry
toast
and
apollinaris
that
man
was
cortlandt
van
duyckink
a
man
worth
eighty
millions
who
inherited
and
held
a
sacred
seat
in
the
exclusive
inner
circle
of
society
billy
mcmahan
spoke
to
no
one
around
him
because
he
knew
no
one
van
duyckink
kept
his
eyes
on
his
plate
because
he
knew
that
every
one
present
was
hungry
to
catch
his
he
could
bestow
knighthood
and
prestige
by
a
nod
and
he
was
chary
of
creating
a
too
extensive
nobility
and
then
billy
mcmahan
conceived
and
accomplished
the
most
startling
and
audacious
act
of
his
life
he
rose
deliberately
and
walked
over
to
cortlandt
van
duyckink
table
and
held
out
his
hand
say
van
duyckink
he
said
i
heard
you
was
talking
about
starting
some
reforms
among
the
poor
people
down
in
my
district
mcmahan
you
know
say
now
if
that
straight
i
do
all
i
can
to
help
you
and
what
i
says
goes
in
that
neck
of
the
woods
do
it
oh
say
i
rather
guess
it
does
van
duyckink
rather
sombre
eyes
lighted
up
he
rose
to
his
lank
height
and
grasped
billy
mcmahan
hand
thank
you
mcmahan
he
said
in
his
deep
serious
tones
i
have
been
thinking
of
doing
some
work
of
that
sort
i
shall
be
glad
of
your
assistance
it
pleases
me
to
have
become
acquainted
with
you
billy
walked
back
to
his
seat
his
shoulder
was
tingling
from
the
accolade
bestowed
by
royalty
a
hundred
eyes
were
now
turned
upon
him
in
envy
and
new
admiration
william
darragh
mcmahan
trembled
with
ecstasy
so
that
her
diamonds
smote
the
eye
almost
with
pain
and
now
it
was
apparent
that
at
many
tables
there
were
those
who
suddenly
remembered
that
they
enjoyed
acquaintance
he
saw
smiles
and
bows
about
him
he
became
enveloped
in
the
aura
of
dizzy
greatness
his
campaign
coolness
deserted
him
wine
for
that
gang
he
commanded
the
waiter
pointing
with
his
finger
wine
over
there
wine
to
those
three
gents
by
that
green
bush
tell
it
on
me
d
n
it
wine
for
everybody
the
waiter
ventured
to
whisper
that
it
was
perhaps
inexpedient
to
carry
out
the
order
in
consideration
of
the
dignity
of
the
house
and
its
custom
all
right
said
billy
if
it
against
the
rules
i
wonder
if
do
to
send
my
friend
van
duyckink
a
bottle
no
well
flow
all
right
at
the
caffy
just
the
same
it
be
rubber
boots
for
anybody
who
comes
in
there
any
time
up
to
billy
mcmahan
was
happy
he
had
shaken
the
hand
of
cortlandt
van
duyckink
the
big
auto
with
its
shining
metal
work
looked
out
of
place
moving
slowly
among
the
push
carts
and
on
the
lower
east
side
so
did
cortlandt
van
duyckink
with
his
aristocratic
face
and
white
thin
hands
as
he
steered
carefully
between
the
groups
of
ragged
scurrying
youngsters
in
the
streets
and
so
did
miss
constance
schuyler
with
her
dim
ascetic
beauty
seated
at
his
side
oh
cortlandt
she
breathed
is
it
sad
that
human
beings
have
to
live
in
such
wretchedness
and
poverty
and
you
how
noble
it
is
of
you
to
think
of
them
to
give
your
time
and
money
to
improve
their
condition
van
duyckink
turned
his
solemn
eyes
upon
her
it
is
little
he
said
sadly
that
i
can
do
the
question
is
a
large
one
and
belongs
to
society
but
even
individual
effort
is
not
thrown
away
look
constance
on
this
street
i
have
arranged
to
build
soup
kitchens
where
no
one
who
is
hungry
will
be
turned
away
and
down
this
other
street
are
the
old
buildings
that
i
shall
cause
to
be
torn
down
and
there
erect
others
in
place
of
those
of
fire
and
disease
down
delancey
slowly
crept
the
auto
away
from
it
toddled
coveys
of
wondering
barefooted
unwashed
children
it
stopped
before
a
crazy
brick
structure
foul
and
awry
van
duyckink
alighted
to
examine
at
a
better
perspective
one
of
the
leaning
walls
down
the
steps
of
the
building
came
a
young
man
who
seemed
to
epitomize
its
degradation
squalor
and
infelicity
a
pale
unsavory
young
man
puffing
at
a
cigarette
obeying
a
sudden
impulse
van
duyckink
stepped
out
and
warmly
grasped
the
hand
of
what
seemed
to
him
a
living
rebuke
i
want
to
know
you
people
he
said
sincerely
i
am
going
to
help
you
as
much
as
i
can
we
shall
be
friends
as
the
auto
crept
carefully
away
cortlandt
van
duyckink
felt
an
unaccustomed
glow
about
his
heart
he
was
near
to
being
a
happy
man
he
had
shaken
the
hand
of
ikey
snigglefritz
the
purple
dress
we
are
to
consider
the
shade
known
as
purple
it
is
a
color
justly
in
repute
among
the
sons
and
daughters
of
man
emperors
claim
it
for
their
especial
dye
good
fellows
everywhere
seek
to
bring
their
noses
to
the
genial
hue
that
follows
the
commingling
of
the
red
and
blue
we
say
of
princes
that
they
are
born
to
the
purple
and
no
doubt
they
are
for
the
colic
tinges
their
faces
with
the
royal
tint
equally
with
the
countenance
of
a
woodchopper
brat
all
women
love
it
when
it
is
the
fashion
and
now
purple
is
being
worn
you
notice
it
on
the
streets
of
course
other
colors
are
quite
stylish
as
well
in
fact
i
saw
a
lovely
thing
the
other
day
in
olive
green
albatross
with
a
flounce
skirt
trimmed
with
insert
squares
of
silk
and
a
draped
fichu
of
lace
opening
over
a
shirred
vest
and
double
puff
sleeves
with
a
lace
band
holding
two
gathered
frills
but
you
see
lots
of
purple
too
oh
yes
you
do
just
take
a
walk
down
street
any
afternoon
therefore
maida
the
girl
with
the
big
brown
eyes
and
hair
in
the
store
said
to
grace
the
girl
with
the
rhinestone
brooch
and
flavor
to
her
speech
going
to
have
a
purple
dress
a
purple
dress
for
thanksgiving
oh
are
you
said
grace
putting
away
some
gloves
into
the
box
well
it
me
for
red
you
see
more
red
on
fifth
avenue
and
the
men
all
seem
to
like
it
i
like
purple
best
said
maida
and
old
schlegel
has
promised
to
make
it
for
it
going
to
be
lovely
i
going
to
have
a
plaited
skirt
and
a
blouse
coat
trimmed
with
a
band
of
galloon
under
a
white
cloth
collar
with
two
rows
of
sly
boots
said
grace
with
an
educated
soutache
braid
over
a
surpliced
white
vest
and
a
plaited
basque
and
sly
boots
sly
boots
repeated
plaited
gigot
sleeves
with
a
drawn
velvet
ribbon
over
an
inside
cuff
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
that
you
think
ramsay
likes
purple
i
heard
him
say
yesterday
he
thought
some
of
the
dark
shades
of
red
were
stunning
i
do
care
said
maida
i
prefer
purple
and
them
that
like
it
can
just
take
the
other
side
of
the
street
which
suggests
the
thought
that
after
all
the
followers
of
purple
may
be
subject
to
slight
delusions
danger
is
near
when
a
maiden
thinks
she
can
wear
purple
regardless
of
complexions
and
opinions
and
when
emperors
think
their
purple
robes
will
wear
forever
maida
had
saved
after
eight
months
of
economy
and
this
had
bought
the
goods
for
the
purple
dress
and
paid
schlegel
on
the
making
of
it
on
the
day
before
thanksgiving
she
would
have
just
enough
to
pay
the
remaining
and
then
for
a
holiday
in
a
new
dress
can
earth
offer
anything
more
enchanting
old
bachman
the
proprietor
of
the
store
always
gave
a
thanksgiving
dinner
to
his
employees
on
every
one
of
the
subsequent
days
excusing
sundays
he
would
remind
them
of
the
joys
of
the
past
banquet
and
the
hopes
of
the
coming
ones
thus
inciting
them
to
increased
enthusiasm
in
work
the
dinner
was
given
in
the
store
on
one
of
the
long
tables
in
the
middle
of
the
room
they
tacked
wrapping
paper
over
the
front
windows
and
the
turkeys
and
other
good
things
were
brought
in
the
back
way
from
the
restaurant
on
the
corner
you
will
perceive
that
the
was
not
a
fashionable
department
store
with
escalators
and
pompadours
it
was
almost
small
enough
to
be
called
an
emporium
and
you
could
actually
go
in
there
and
get
waited
on
and
walk
out
again
and
always
at
the
thanksgiving
dinners
ramsay
oh
bother
i
should
have
mentioned
ramsay
first
of
all
he
is
more
important
than
purple
or
green
or
even
the
red
cranberry
sauce
ramsay
was
the
head
clerk
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
am
for
him
he
never
pinched
the
girls
arms
when
he
passed
them
in
dark
corners
of
the
store
and
when
he
told
them
stories
when
business
was
dull
and
the
girls
giggled
and
said
oh
pshaw
it
was
bernard
they
meant
at
all
besides
being
a
gentleman
ramsay
was
queer
and
original
in
other
ways
he
was
a
health
crank
and
believed
that
people
should
never
eat
anything
that
was
good
for
them
he
was
violently
opposed
to
anybody
being
comfortable
and
coming
in
out
of
snow
storms
or
wearing
overshoes
or
taking
medicine
or
coddling
themselves
in
any
way
every
one
of
the
ten
girls
in
the
store
had
little
dreams
every
night
of
becoming
ramsay
for
next
year
old
bachman
was
going
to
take
him
in
for
a
partner
and
each
one
of
them
knew
that
if
she
should
catch
him
she
would
knock
those
cranky
health
notions
of
his
sky
high
before
the
wedding
cake
indigestion
was
over
ramsay
was
master
of
ceremonies
at
the
dinners
always
they
had
two
italians
in
to
play
a
violin
and
harp
and
had
a
little
dance
in
the
store
and
here
were
two
dresses
being
conceived
to
charm
ramsay
one
purple
and
the
other
red
of
course
the
other
eight
girls
were
going
to
have
dresses
too
but
they
did
count
very
likely
they
wear
some
nothing
as
resplendent
as
purple
or
red
grace
had
saved
her
money
too
she
was
going
to
buy
her
dress
oh
what
the
use
of
bothering
with
a
tailor
when
you
got
a
figger
it
easy
to
get
a
fit
the
are
intended
for
a
perfect
figger
except
i
have
to
have
all
taken
in
at
the
waist
the
average
figger
is
so
large
waisted
the
night
before
thanksgiving
came
maida
hurried
home
keen
and
bright
with
the
thoughts
of
the
blessed
morrow
her
thoughts
were
of
purple
but
they
were
white
themselves
the
joyous
enthusiasm
of
the
young
for
the
pleasures
that
youth
must
have
or
wither
she
knew
purple
would
become
her
and
for
the
thousandth
time
she
tried
to
assure
herself
that
it
was
purple
ramsay
said
he
liked
and
not
red
she
was
going
home
first
to
get
the
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
tissue
paper
in
the
bottom
drawer
of
her
dresser
and
then
she
was
going
to
pay
schlegel
and
take
the
dress
home
herself
grace
lived
in
the
same
house
she
occupied
the
hall
room
above
maida
at
home
maida
found
clamor
and
confusion
the
landlady
tongue
clattering
sourly
in
the
halls
like
a
churn
dasher
dabbing
in
buttermilk
and
then
grace
come
down
to
her
room
crying
with
eyes
as
red
as
any
dress
she
says

get

maida
sat
through
the
long
morning
and
past
the
time
of
the
dinner
at
the
store
in
her
mind
she
could
hear
the
girls
shrieking
over
a
could
hear
old
bachman
roar
over
his
own
jokes
could
see
the
diamonds
of
fat
bachman
who
came
to
the
store
only
on
thanksgiving
days
could
see
ramsay
moving
about
alert
kindly
looking
to
the
comfort
of
all
at
four
in
the
afternoon
with
an
expressionless
face
and
a
lifeless
air
she
slowly
made
her
way
to
schlegel
shop
and
told
him
she
could
not
pay

due

breathed
a
millionth
part
of
the
thanks
in
her
heart
and
hurried
away
with
her
dress
as
she
left
the
shop
a
smart
dash
of
rain
struck
upon
her
face
she
smiled
and
did
not
feel
it
ladies
who
shop
in
carriages
you
do
not
understand
girls
whose
wardrobes
are
charged
to
the
old
man
account
you
can
not
begin
to
comprehend
you
could
not
understand
why
maida
did
not
feel
the
cold
dash
of
the
thanksgiving
rain
at
five
she
went
out
upon
the
street
wearing
her
purple
dress
the
rain
had
increased
and
it
beat
down
upon
her
in
a
steady
pour
people
were
scurrying
home
and
to
cars
with
umbrellas
and
tight
buttoned
raincoats
many
of
them
turned
their
heads
to
marvel
at
this
beautiful
serene
girl
in
the
purple
dress
walking
through
the
storm
as
though
she
were
strolling
in
a
garden
under
summer
skies
i
say
you
do
not
understand
it
ladies
of
the
full
purse
and
varied
wardrobe
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
live
with
a
perpetual
longing
for
pretty
things
to
starve
eight
months
in
order
to
bring
a
purple
dress
and
a
holiday
together
what
difference
if
it
rained
hailed
blew
snowed
cycloned
maida
had
no
umbrella
nor
overshoes
she
had
her
purple
dress
and
she
walked
abroad
let
the
elements
do
their
worst
a
starved
heart
must
have
one
crumb
during
a
year
the
rain
ran
down
and
dripped
from
her
fingers
some
one
turned
a
corner
and
blocked
her
way
she
looked
up
into
ramsay
eyes
sparkling
with
admiration
and
interest
why
miss
maida
said
he
you
look
simply
magnificent
in
your
new
dress
i
was
greatly
disappointed
not
to
see
you
at
our
dinner
and
of
all
the
girls
i
ever
knew
you
show
the
greatest
sense
and
intelligence
there
is
nothing
more
healthful
and
invigorating
than
braving
the
weather
as
you
are
doing
may
i
walk
with
you
and
maida
blushed
and
sneezed
the
foreign
policy
of
company
john
byrnes
driver
of
engine
company
no
was
afflicted
with
what
his
comrades
called
japanitis
byrnes
had
a
war
map
spread
permanently
upon
a
table
in
the
second
story
of
the
and
he
could
explain
to
you
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
the
exact
positions
conditions
and
intentions
of
both
the
russian
and
japanese
armies
he
had
little
clusters
of
pins
stuck
in
the
map
which
represented
the
opposing
forces
and
these
he
moved
about
from
day
to
day
in
conformity
with
the
war
news
in
the
daily
papers
wherever
the
japs
won
a
victory
john
byrnes
would
shift
his
pins
and
then
he
would
execute
a
war
dance
of
delight
and
the
other
firemen
would
hear
him
yell
go
it
you
blamed
little
hot
tamales
eat
up
you
little
bull
terriers
give
another
of
them
yalu
looloos
and
you
eat
rice
in
petersburg
talk
about
your
russians
say
would
they
give
you
a
painsky
when
it
comes
to
a
scrapovitch
not
even
on
the
fair
island
of
nippon
was
there
a
more
enthusiastic
champion
of
the
mikado
men
supporters
of
the
russian
cause
did
well
to
keep
clear
of
no
sometimes
all
thoughts
of
the
japs
left
john
byrnes
head
that
was
when
the
alarm
of
fire
had
sounded
and
he
was
strapped
in
his
driver
seat
on
the
swaying
cart
guiding
erebus
and
joe
the
finest
team
in
the
whole
department
according
to
the
crew
of
of
all
the
codes
adopted
by
man
for
regulating
his
actions
toward
his
the
greatest
are
these
the
code
of
king
arthur
knights
of
the
round
table
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
unwritten
rules
of
the
new
york
fire
department
the
round
table
methods
are
no
longer
practicable
since
the
invention
of
street
cars
and
suits
and
our
constitution
is
being
found
more
and
more
unconstitutional
every
day
so
the
code
of
our
firemen
must
be
considered
in
the
lead
with
the
golden
rule
and
jeffries
new
punch
trying
for
place
and
show
the
constitution
says
that
one
man
is
as
good
as
another
but
the
fire
department
says
he
is
better
this
is
a
too
generous
theory
but
the
law
will
not
allow
itself
to
be
construed
otherwise
all
of
which
comes
perilously
near
to
being
a
paradox
and
commends
itself
to
the
attention
of
the
a
one
of
the
transatlantic
liners
dumped
out
at
ellis
island
a
lump
of
protozoa
which
was
expected
to
evolve
into
an
american
citizen
a
steward
kicked
him
down
the
gangway
a
doctor
pounced
upon
his
eyes
like
a
raven
seeking
for
trachoma
or
ophthalmia
he
was
hustled
ashore
and
ejected
into
the
city
in
the
name
of
liberty
perhaps
theoretically
thus
inoculating
against
kingocracy
with
a
drop
of
its
own
virus
this
hypodermic
injection
of
europeanism
wandered
happily
into
the
veins
of
the
city
with
the
broad
grin
of
a
pleased
child
it
was
not
burdened
with
baggage
cares
or
ambitions
its
body
was
lithely
built
and
clothed
in
a
sort
of
foreign
fustian
its
face
was
brightly
vacant
with
a
small
flat
nose
and
was
mostly
covered
by
a
thick
ragged
curling
beard
like
the
coat
of
a
spaniel
in
the
pocket
of
the
imported
thing
were
a
few
coins
denarii
scudi
kopecks
pfennigs
pilasters
whatever
the
financial
nomenclature
of
his
unknown
country
may
have
been
prattling
to
himself
always
broadly
grinning
pleased
by
the
roar
and
movement
of
the
barbarous
city
into
which
the
steamship
had
shunted
him
the
alien
strayed
away
from
the
sea
which
he
hated
as
far
as
the
district
covered
by
engine
company
no
light
as
a
cork
he
was
kept
bobbing
along
by
the
human
tide
the
crudest
atom
in
all
the
silt
of
the
stream
that
emptied
into
the
reservoir
of
liberty
while
crossing
third
avenue
he
slowed
his
steps
enchanted
by
the
thunder
of
the
elevated
trains
above
him
and
the
soothing
crash
of
the
wheels
on
the
cobbles
and
then
there
was
a
new
delightful
chord
in
the
uproar
the
musical
clanging
of
a
gong
and
a
great
shining
juggernaut
belching
fire
and
smoke
that
people
were
hurrying
to
see
this
beautiful
thing
entrancing
to
the
eye
dashed
past
and
the
protoplasmic
immigrant
stepped
into
the
wake
of
it
with
his
broad
enraptured
uncomprehending
grin
and
so
stepping
stepped
into
the
path
of
no
flying
with
john
byrnes
gripping
with
arms
of
steel
the
reins
over
the
plunging
backs
of
erebus
and
joe
the
unwritten
constitutional
code
of
the
fireman
has
no
exceptions
or
amendments
it
is
a
simple
thing
as
simple
as
the
rule
of
three
there
was
the
heedless
unit
in
the
right
of
way
there
was
the
and
the
iron
pillar
of
the
elevated
railroad
john
byrnes
swung
all
his
weight
and
muscle
on
the
left
rein
the
team
and
cart
swerved
that
way
and
crashed
like
a
torpedo
into
the
pillar
the
men
on
the
cart
went
flying
like
skittles
the
strap
burst
the
pillar
rang
with
the
shock
and
john
byrnes
fell
on
the
car
track
with
a
broken
shoulder
twenty
feet
away
while
erebus
beautiful
erebus
lay
whickering
in
his
harness
with
a
broken
leg
in
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
engine
company
no
the
details
will
be
lightly
touched
the
company
does
not
like
to
be
reminded
of
that
day
there
was
a
great
crowd
and
hurry
calls
were
sent
in
and
while
the
ambulance
gong
was
clearing
the
way
the
men
of
no
heard
the
crack
of
the
agent
pistol
and
turned
their
heads
away
not
daring
to
look
toward
erebus
again
when
the
firemen
got
back
to
the
they
found
that
one
of
them
was
dragging
by
the
collar
the
cause
of
their
desolation
and
grief
they
set
it
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
gathered
grimly
about
it
through
its
whiskers
the
calamitous
object
chattered
effervescently
and
waved
its
hands
sounds
like
a
seidlitz
powder
said
mike
dowling
disgustedly
and
it
makes
me
sicker
than
one
call
that
a
man
that
hoss
was
worth
a
steamer
full
of
such
animals
it
a
immigrant
that
what
it
is
look
at
the
doctor
chalk
mark
on
its
coat
said
reilly
the
desk
man
it
just
landed
it
must
be
a
kind
of
a
dago
or
a
hun
or
one
of
them
finns
i
guess
that
the
kind
of
truck
that
europe
unloads
onto
us
think
of
a
thing
like
that
getting
in
the
way
and
laying
john
up
in
hospital
and
spoiling
the
best
fire
team
in
the
city
groaned
another
fireman
it
ought
to
be
taken
down
to
the
dock
and
drowned
somebody
go
around
and
get
sloviski
suggested
the
engine
driver
and
let
see
what
nation
is
responsible
for
this
conglomeration
of
hair
and
head
noises
sloviski
kept
a
delicatessen
store
around
the
corner
on
third
avenue
and
was
reputed
to
be
a
linguist
one
of
the
men
fetched
him
a
fat
cringing
man
with
a
discursive
eye
and
the
odors
of
many
kinds
of
meats
upon
him
take
a
whirl
at
this
importation
with
your
sloviski
requested
mike
dowling
we
ca
quite
figure
out
whether
he
from
the
hackensack
bottoms
or
sloviski
addressed
the
stranger
in
several
dialects
that
ranged
in
rhythm
and
cadence
from
the
sounds
produced
by
a
tonsilitis
gargle
to
the
opening
of
a
can
of
tomatoes
with
a
pair
of
scissors
the
immigrant
replied
in
accents
resembling
the
uncorking
of
a
bottle
of
ginger
ale
i
have
you
his
name
reported
sloviski
you
shall
not
pronounce
it
writing
of
it
in
paper
is
better
they
gave
him
paper
and
he
wrote
demetre
svangvsk
looks
like
short
hand
said
the
desk
man
he
speaks
some
language
continued
the
interpreter
wiping
his
forehead
of
austria
and
mixed
with
a
little
turkish
and
den
he
have
some
magyar
words
and
a
polish
or
two
and
many
like
the
roumanian
but
not
without
talk
of
one
tribe
in
bessarabia
i
do
not
him
quite
understand
would
you
call
him
a
dago
or
a
polocker
or
what
asked
mike
frowning
at
the
polyglot
description
he
is
a
answered
sloviski
he
is
a
i
dink
he
come
from
i
dink
he
is
a
fool
he
concluded
impatient
at
his
linguistic
failure
and
if
you
pleases
i
will
go
back
at
mine
delicatessen
whatever
he
is
he
a
bird
said
mike
dowling
and
you
want
to
watch
him
fly
taking
by
the
wing
the
alien
fowl
that
had
fluttered
into
the
nest
of
liberty
mike
led
him
to
the
door
of
the
and
bestowed
upon
him
a
kick
hearty
enough
to
convey
the
entire
animus
of
company
demetre
svangvsk
hustled
away
down
the
sidewalk
turning
once
to
show
his
ineradicable
grin
to
the
aggrieved
firemen
in
three
weeks
john
byrnes
was
back
at
his
post
from
the
hospital
with
great
gusto
he
proceeded
to
bring
his
war
map
up
to
date
my
money
on
the
japs
every
time
he
declared
why
look
at
them
russians
they
nothing
but
wolves
wipe
out
i
say
and
the
little
old
jiu
jitsu
gang
are
just
the
cherry
blossoms
to
do
the
trick
and
do
you
forget
it
the
second
day
after
byrnes
reappearance
came
demetre
svangvsk
the
unidentified
to
the
with
a
broader
grin
than
ever
he
managed
to
convey
the
idea
that
he
wished
to
congratulate
the
driver
on
his
recovery
and
to
apologize
for
having
caused
the
accident
this
he
accomplished
by
so
many
extravagant
gestures
and
explosive
noises
that
the
company
was
diverted
for
half
an
hour
then
they
kicked
him
out
again
and
on
the
next
day
he
came
back
grinning
how
or
where
he
lived
no
one
knew
and
then
john
byrnes
son
chris
who
brought
him
convalescent
delicacies
from
home
to
eat
took
a
fancy
to
svangvsk
and
they
allowed
him
to
loaf
about
the
door
of
the
occasionally
one
afternoon
the
big
drab
automobile
of
the
deputy
fire
commissioner
buzzed
up
to
the
door
of
no
and
the
deputy
stepped
inside
for
an
informal
inspection
the
men
kicked
svangvsk
out
a
little
harder
than
usual
and
proudly
escorted
the
deputy
around
in
which
everything
shone
like
my
lady
mirror
the
deputy
respected
the
sorrow
of
the
company
concerning
the
loss
of
erebus
and
he
had
come
to
promise
it
another
mate
for
joe
that
would
do
him
credit
so
they
let
joe
out
of
his
stall
and
showed
the
deputy
how
deserving
he
was
of
the
finest
mate
that
could
be
in
horsedom
while
they
were
circling
around
joe
confabbing
chris
climbed
into
the
deputy
auto
and
threw
the
power
full
on
the
men
heard
a
monster
puffing
and
a
shriek
from
the
lad
and
sprang
out
too
late
the
big
auto
shot
away
luckily
taking
a
straight
course
down
the
street
the
boy
knew
nothing
of
its
machinery
he
sat
clutching
the
cushions
and
howling
with
the
power
on
nothing
could
have
stopped
that
auto
except
a
brick
house
and
there
was
nothing
for
chris
to
gain
by
such
a
stoppage
demetre
svangvsk
was
just
coming
in
again
with
a
grin
for
another
kick
when
chris
played
his
merry
little
prank
while
the
others
sprang
for
the
door
demetre
sprang
for
joe
he
glided
upon
the
horse
bare
back
like
a
snake
and
shouted
something
at
him
like
the
crack
of
a
dozen
whips
one
of
the
firemen
afterward
swore
that
joe
answered
him
back
in
the
same
language
ten
seconds
after
the
auto
started
the
big
horse
was
eating
up
the
asphalt
behind
it
like
a
strip
of
macaroni
some
people
two
blocks
and
a
half
away
saw
the
rescue
they
said
that
the
auto
was
nothing
but
a
drab
noise
with
a
black
speck
in
the
middle
of
it
for
chris
when
a
big
bay
horse
with
a
lizard
lying
on
its
back
cantered
up
alongside
of
it
and
the
lizard
reached
over
and
picked
the
black
speck
out
of
the
noise
only
fifteen
minutes
after
svangvsk
last
kicking
at
the
hands
or
rather
the
feet
of
engine
company
no
he
rode
joe
back
through
the
door
with
the
boy
safe
but
acutely
conscious
of
the
licking
he
was
going
to
receive
svangvsk
slipped
to
the
floor
leaned
his
head
against
joe
and
made
a
noise
like
a
clucking
hen
joe
nodded
and
whistled
loudly
through
his
nostrils
putting
to
shame
the
knowledge
of
sloviski
of
the
delicatessen
john
byrnes
walked
up
to
svangvsk
who
grinned
expecting
to
be
kicked
byrnes
gripped
the
outlander
so
strongly
by
the
hand
that
demetre
grinned
anyhow
conceiving
it
to
be
a
new
form
of
punishment
the
heathen
rides
like
a
cossack
remarked
a
fireman
who
had
seen
a
wild
west
show
they
the
greatest
riders
in
the
world
the
word
seemed
to
electrify
svangvsk
he
grinned
wider
than
ever
yas
yas
me
cossack
he
spluttered
striking
his
chest
cossack
repeated
john
byrnes
thoughtfully
ai
that
a
kind
of
a
russian
they
one
of
the
russian
tribes
sure
said
the
desk
man
who
read
books
between
fire
alarms
just
then
alderman
foley
who
was
on
his
way
home
and
did
not
know
of
the
runaway
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
and
called
to
byrnes
hello
there
jimmy
me
boy
how
the
war
coming
along
japs
still
got
the
bear
on
the
trot

said
john
byrnes
argumentatively
them
japs

got
any
walkover
you
wait
till
kuropatkin
gets
a
good
whack
at
and
they
wo
be

of

and
when
she
called
softly
at
the
foot
of

stairs
for
the
pitcher

for

his
heart
went
up
and
down
like
a
milk
punch
in
the
shaker
orderly
and
fit
are
the
rules
of
romance
and
if
you
hurl
the
last
shilling
of
your
fortune
upon
the
bar
for
whiskey
the
bartender
shall
take
it
and
marry
his
boss
daughter
and
good
will
grow
out
of
it
but
not
so
con
for
in
the
presence
of
woman
he
was
and
scarlet
he
who
would
quell
with
his
eye
the
sonorous
youth
whom
the
claret
punch
made
loquacious
or
smash
with
lemon
squeezer
the
obstreperous
or
hurl
gutterward
the
cantankerous
without
a
wrinkle
coming
to
his
white
lawn
tie
when
he
stood
before
woman
he
was
voiceless
incoherent
stuttering
buried
beneath
a
hot
avalanche
of
bashfulness
and
misery
what
then
was
he
before
katherine
a
trembler
with
no
word
to
say
for
himself
a
stone
without
blarney
the
dumbest
lover
that
ever
babbled
of
the
weather
in
the
presence
of
his
divinity
there
came
to
kenealy
two
sunburned
men
riley
and
mcquirk
they
had
conference
with
kenealy
and
then
they
took
possession
of
a
back
room
which
they
filled
with
bottles
and
siphons
and
jugs
and
druggist
measuring
glasses
all
the
appurtenances
and
liquids
of
a
saloon
were
there
but
they
dispensed
no
drinks
all
day
long
the
two
sweltered
in
there
pouring
and
mixing
unknown
brews
and
decoctions
from
the
liquors
in
their
store
riley
had
the
education
and
he
figured
on
reams
of
paper
reducing
gallons
to
ounces
and
quarts
to
fluid
drams
mcquirk
a
morose
man
with
a
red
eye
dashed
each
unsuccessful
completed
mixture
into
the
waste
pipes
with
curses
gentle
husky
and
deep
they
labored
heavily
and
untiringly
to
achieve
some
mysterious
solution
like
two
alchemists
striving
to
resolve
gold
from
the
elements
into
this
back
room
one
evening
when
his
watch
was
done
sauntered
con
his
professional
curiosity
had
been
stirred
by
these
occult
bartenders
at
whose
bar
none
drank
and
who
daily
drew
upon
kenealy
store
of
liquors
to
follow
their
consuming
and
fruitless
experiments
down
the
back
stairs
came
katherine
with
her
smile
like
sunrise
on
gweebarra
bay
good
evening
lantry
says
she
and
what
is
the
news
if
you
please
it
looks
like
stammered
the
shy
one
backing
to
the
wall
it
could
do
better
said
katherine
i
thinking
nothing
the
worse
off
for
a
little
water
in
the
back
room
riley
and
mcquirk
toiled
like
bearded
witches
over
their
strange
compounds
from
fifty
bottles
they
drew
liquids
carefully
measured
after
riley
figures
and
shook
the
whole
together
in
a
great
glass
vessel
then
mcquirk
would
dash
it
out
with
gloomy
profanity
and
they
would
begin
again
sit
down
said
riley
to
con
and
i
tell
you
last
summer
me
and
tim
concludes
that
an
american
bar
in
this
nation
of
nicaragua
would
pay
there
was
a
town
on
the
coast
where
there
nothing
to
eat
but
quinine
and
nothing
to
drink
but
rum
the
natives
and
foreigners
lay
down
with
chills
and
get
up
with
fevers
and
a
good
mixed
drink
is
nature
remedy
for
all
such
tropical
inconveniences
so
we
lays
in
a
fine
stock
of
wet
goods
in
new
york
and
bar
fixtures
and
glassware
and
we
sails
for
that
santa
palma
town
on
a
lime
steamer
on
the
way
me
and
tim
sees
flying
fish
and
plays
with
the
captain
and
steward
and
already
begins
to
feel
like
the
kings
of
the
tropics
of
capricorn
when
we
gets
in
five
hours
of
the
country
that
we
was
going
to
introduce
to
long
drinks
and
short
change
the
captain
calls
us
over
to
the
starboard
binnacle
and
recollects
a
few
things
forgot
to
tell
you
boys
says
he
nicaragua
slapped
an
import
duty
of
per
cent
ad
valorem
on
all
bottled
goods
last
month
the
president
took
a
bottle
of
cincinnati
hair
tonic
by
mistake
for
tobasco
sauce
and
he
getting
even
barrelled
goods
is
free
you
did
mention
it
sooner
says
we
and
we
bought
two
gallon
casks
from
the
captain
and
opened
every
bottle
we
had
and
dumped
the
stuff
all
together
in
the
casks
that
per
cent
would
have
ruined
us
so
we
took
the
chances
on
making
that
cocktail
rather
than
throw
the
stuff
away
well
when
we
landed
we
tapped
one
of
the
barrels
the
mixture
was
something
heartrending
it
was
the
color
of
a
plate
of
bowery
pea
soup
and
it
tasted
like
one
of
those
coffee
substitutes
your
aunt
makes
you
take
for
the
heart
trouble
you
get
by
picking
losers
we
gave
a
nigger
four
fingers
of
it
to
try
it
and
he
lay
under
a
cocoanut
tree
three
days
beating
the
sand
with
his
heels
and
refused
to
sign
a
testimonial
but
the
other
barrel
say
bartender
did
you
ever
put
on
a
straw
hat
with
a
yellow
band
around
it
and
go
up
in
a
balloon
with
a
pretty
girl
with
in
your
pocket
all
at
the
same
time
that
what
thirty
drops
of
it
would
make
you
feel
like
with
two
fingers
of
it
inside
you
you
would
bury
your
face
in
your
hands
and
cry
because
there
was
anything
more
worth
while
around
for
you
to
lick
than
little
jim
jeffries
yes
sir
the
stuff
in
that
second
barrel
was
distilled
elixir
of
battle
money
and
high
life
it
was
the
color
of
gold
and
as
clear
as
glass
and
it
shone
after
dark
like
the
sunshine
was
still
in
it
a
thousand
years
from
now
get
a
drink
like
that
across
the
bar
well
we
started
up
business
with
that
one
line
of
drinks
and
it
was
enough
the
piebald
gentry
of
that
country
stuck
to
it
like
a
hive
of
bees
if
that
barrel
had
lasted
that
country
would
have
become
the
greatest
on
earth
when
we
opened
up
of
mornings
we
had
a
line
of
generals
and
colonels
and
and
revolutionists
a
block
long
waiting
to
be
served
we
started
in
at
cents
silver
a
drink
the
last
ten
gallons
went
easy
at
a
gulp
it
was
wonderful
stuff
it
gave
a
man
courage
and
ambition
and
nerve
to
do
anything
at
the
same
time
he
did
care
whether
his
money
was
tainted
or
fresh
from
the
ice
trust
when
that
barrel
was
half
gone
nicaragua
had
repudiated
the
national
debt
removed
the
duty
on
cigarettes
and
was
about
to
declare
war
on
the
united
states
and
england
was
by
accident
we
discovered
this
king
of
drinks
and
be
by
good
luck
if
we
strike
it
again
for
ten
months
we
been
trying
small
lots
at
a
time
we
mixed
barrels
of
all
the
harmful
ingredients
known
to
the
profession
of
drinking
ye
could
have
stocked
ten
bars
with
the
whiskies
brandies
cordials
bitters
gins
and
wines
me
and
tim
have
wasted
a
glorious
drink
like
that
to
be
denied
to
the
world
is
a
sorrow
and
a
loss
of
money
the
united
states
as
a
nation
would
welcome
a
drink
of
that
sort
and
pay
for
it
all
the
while
mcquirk
had
been
carefully
measuring
and
pouring
together
small
quantities
of
various
spirits
as
riley
called
them
from
his
latest
pencilled
prescription
the
completed
mixture
was
of
a
vile
mottled
chocolate
color
mcquirk
tasted
it
and
hurled
it
with
appropriate
epithets
into
the
waste
sink
is
a
strange
story
even
if
true
said
con
i
be
going
now
along
to
my
supper
take
a
drink
said
riley
we
all
kinds
except
the
lost
blend
i
never
drink
said
con
anything
stronger
than
water
i
am
just
after
meeting
miss
katherine
by
the
stairs
she
said
a
true
word
not
anything
says
she
is
better
off
for
a
little
water
when
con
had
left
them
riley
almost
felled
mcquirk
by
a
blow
on
the
back
did
ye
hear
that
he
shouted
two
fools
are
we
the
six
dozen
bottles
of
we
had
on
the
ship
ye
opened
them
yourself
which
barrel
did
ye
pour
them
in
which
barrel
ye
mudhead
i
mind
said
mcquirk
slowly
was
in
the
second
barrel
we
opened
i
mind
the
blue
piece
of
paper
pasted
on
the
side
of
it
we
got
it
now
cried
riley
was
that
we
lacked
is
the
water
that
does
the
trick
everything
else
we
had
right
hurry
man
and
get
two
bottles
of
from
the
bar
while
i
figure
out
the
proportionments
with
me
pencil
an
hour
later
con
strolled
down
the
sidewalk
toward
kenealy
café
thus
faithful
employees
haunt
during
their
recreation
hours
the
vicinity
where
they
labor
drawn
by
some
mysterious
attraction
a
police
patrol
wagon
stood
at
the
side
door
three
able
cops
were
half
carrying
half
hustling
riley
and
mcquirk
up
its
rear
steps
the
eyes
and
faces
of
each
bore
the
bruises
and
cuts
of
sanguinary
and
assiduous
conflict
yet
they
whooped
with
strange
joy
and
directed
upon
the
police
the
feeble
remnants
of
their
pugnacious
madness
began
fighting
each
other
in
the
back
room
explained
kenealy
to
con
and
singing
that
was
worse
smashed
everything
pretty
much
up
but
they
good
men
they
pay
for
everything
trying
to
invent
some
new
kind
of
cocktail
they
was
i
see
they
come
out
all
right
in
the
morning
con
sauntered
into
the
back
room
to
view
the
battlefield
as
he
went
through
the
hall
katherine
was
just
coming
down
the
stairs
good
evening
again
lantry
said
she
and
is
there
no
news
from
the
weather
yet
still
threatens
said
con
slipping
past
with
red
in
his
smooth
pale
cheek
riley
and
mcquirk
had
indeed
waged
a
great
and
friendly
battle
broken
bottles
and
glasses
were
everywhere
the
room
was
full
of
alcohol
fumes
the
floor
was
variegated
with
spirituous
puddles
on
the
table
stood
a
glass
graduated
measure
in
the
bottom
of
it
were
two
tablespoonfuls
of
liquid
a
bright
golden
liquid
that
seemed
to
hold
the
sunshine
a
prisoner
in
its
auriferous
depths
con
smelled
it
he
tasted
it
he
drank
it
as
he
returned
through
the
hall
katherine
was
just
going
up
the
stairs
no
news
yet
mr
lantry
she
asked
with
her
teasing
laugh
con
lifted
her
clear
from
the
floor
and
held
her
there
the
news
is
he
said
that
we
to
be
married
put
me
down
sir
she
cried
indignantly
or
i
will
oh
con
where
oh
wherever
did
you
get
the
nerve
to
say
it
a
harlem
tragedy
harlem
fink
had
dropped
into
cassidy
flat
one
flight
below
ai
it
a
beaut
said
cassidy
she
turned
her
face
proudly
for
her
friend
fink
to
see
one
eye
was
nearly
closed
with
a
great
bruise
around
it
her
lip
was
cut
and
bleeding
a
little
and
there
were
red
on
each
side
of
her
neck
my
husband
would
ever
think
of
doing
that
to
me
said
fink
concealing
her
envy
i
would
have
a
man
declared
cassidy
that
did
beat
me
up
at
least
once
a
week
shows
he
thinks
something
of
you
say
but
that
last
dose
jack
gave
me
was
no
homeopathic
one
i
can
see
stars
yet
but
he
be
the
sweetest
man
in
town
for
the
rest
of
the
week
to
make
up
for
it
this
eye
is
good
for
theater
tickets
and
a
silk
shirt
waist
at
the
very
least
i
should
hope
said
fink
assuming
complacency
that
fink
is
too
much
of
a
gentleman
ever
to
raise
his
hand
against
me
oh
go
on
maggie
said
cassidy
laughing
and
applying
witch
hazel
you
only
jealous
your
old
man
is
too
frappéd
and
slow
to
ever
give
you
a
punch
he
just
sits
down
and
practises
physical
culture
with
a
newspaper
when
he
comes
home
now
ai
that
the
truth
fink
certainly
peruses
of
the
papers
when
he
comes
home
acknowledged
fink
with
a
toss
of
her
head
but
he
certainly
do
ever
make
no
steve
out
of
me
just
to
amuse
himself
that
a
sure
thing
cassidy
laughed
the
contented
laugh
of
the
guarded
and
happy
matron
with
the
air
of
cornelia
exhibiting
her
jewels
she
drew
down
the
collar
of
her
kimono
and
revealed
another
treasured
bruise
edged
with
olive
and
orange
a
bruise
now
nearly
well
but
still
to
memory
dear
fink
capitulated
the
formal
light
in
her
eye
softened
to
envious
admiration
she
and
cassidy
had
been
chums
in
the
downtown
factory
before
they
had
married
one
year
before
now
she
and
her
man
occupied
the
flat
above
mame
and
her
man
therefore
she
could
not
put
on
airs
with
mame
do
it
hurt
when
he
soaks
you
asked
fink
curiously
hurt
mrs
cassidy
gave
a
soprano
scream
of
delight
well
say
did
you
ever
have
a
brick
house
fall
on
you
well
that
just
the
way
it
feels
just
like
when
they
digging
you
out
of
the
ruins
jack
got
a
left
that
spells
two
matinees
and
a
new
pair
of
oxfords
and
his
right
well
it
takes
a
trip
to
coney
and
six
pairs
of
openwork
silk
lisle
threads
to
make
that
good
but
what
does
he
beat
you
for
inquired
fink
with
eyes
silly
said
cassidy
indulgently
why
because
he
full
it
generally
on
saturday
nights
but
what
cause
do
you
give
him
persisted
the
seeker
after
knowledge
why
did
i
marry
him
jack
comes
in
tanked
up
and
i
here
ai
i
who
else
has
he

catch
him
once

because
it
is
jack
ai

about

just
lushes
till

then
he
makes
for

me
up
saturday
nights
i
just
move
the
furniture
with
sharp
corners
out
of
the
way
so
i
wo
cut
my
head
when
he
gets
his
work
in
he
got
a
left
swing
that
jars
you
sometimes
i
take
the
count
in
the
first
round
but
when
i
feel
like
having
a
good
time
during
the
week
or
want
some
new
rags
i
come
up
again
for
more
punishment
that
what
i
done
last
night
jack
knows
i

wanting
a
black
silk
waist

a
month
and
i

black
eye

bring

you
what
mag
i
bet
you
the
ice
cream
he
brings
it
fink

thinking
deeply
my
mart
she

me
a
lick
in
his
life
it
just
like
you
said
mame
he
comes
in
grouchy
and
ai
got
a
word
to
say
he
never
takes
me
out
anywhere
he
a
at
home
for
fair
he
buys
me
things
but
he
looks
so
glum
about
it
that
i
never
appreciate
cassidy
slipped
an
arm
around
her
chum
you
poor
thing
she
said
but
everybody
ca
have
a
husband
like
jack
marriage
would
be
no
failure
if
they
was
all
like
him
these
discontented
wives
you
hear
about
what
they
need
is
a
man
to
come
home
and
kick
their
slats
in
once
a
week
and
then
make
it
up
in
kisses
and
chocolate
creams
that
give
some
interest
in
life
what
i
want
is
a
masterful
man
that
slugs
you
when
he
jagged
and
hugs
you
when
he
ai
jagged
preserve
me
from
the
man
that
ai
got
the
sand
to
do

sighed
the
hallways
were
suddenly
filled
with
sound
the
door
flew
open
at
the
kick
of
cassidy
his
arms
were
occupied
with
bundles
mame
flew
and
hung
about
his
neck
her
sound
eye
sparkled
with
the
love
light
that
shines
in
the
eye
of
the
maori
maid
when
she
recovers
consciousness
in
the
hut
of
the
wooer
who
has
stunned
and
dragged
her
there
hello
old
girl
shouted
cassidy
he
shed
his
bundles
and
lifted
her
off
her
feet
in
a
mighty
hug

fink
i
must
be
going
along
up
now
mart
be
home
for
supper
soon
i
bring
you
down
that
pattern
you
wanted
mame
fink
went
up
to
her
flat
and
had
a
little
cry
it
was
a
meaningless
cry
the
kind
of
cry
that
only
a
woman
knows
about
a
cry
from
no
particular
cause
altogether
an
absurd
cry
the
most
transient
and
the
most
hopeless
cry
in
the
repertory
of
grief
why
had
martin
never
thrashed
her
he
was
as
big
and
strong
as
jack
cassidy
did
he
not
care
for
her
at
all
he
never
quarrelled
he
came
home
and
lounged
about
silent
glum
idle
he
was
a
fairly
good
provider
but
he
ignored
the
spices
of
life
fink
ship
of
dreams
was
becalmed
her
captain
ranged
between
plum
duff
and
his
hammock
if
only
he
would
shiver
his
timbers
or
stamp
his
foot
on
the
now
and
then
and
she
had
thought
to
sail
so
merrily
touching
at
ports
in
the
delectable
isles
but
now
to
vary
the
figure
she
was
ready
to
throw
up
the
sponge
tired
out
without
a
scratch
to
show
for
all
those
tame
rounds
with
her
sparring
partner
for
one
moment
she
almost
hated
mame
mame
with
her
cuts
and
bruises
her
salve
of
presents
and
kisses
her
stormy
voyage
with
her
fighting
brutal
loving
mate
fink
came
home
at
he
was
permeated
with
the
curse
of
domesticity
beyond
the
portals
of
his
cozy
home
he
cared
not
to
roam
to
roam
he
was
the
man
who
had
caught
the
street
car
the
anaconda
that
had
swallowed
its
prey
the
tree
that
lay
as
it
had
fallen
like
the
supper
mart
asked
fink
who
had
striven
over
it
grunted
fink
after
supper
he
gathered
his
newspapers
to
read
he
sat
in
his
stocking
feet
arise
some
new
dante
and
sing
me
the
befitting
corner
of
perdition
for
the
man
who
sitteth
in
the
house
in
his
stockinged
feet
sisters
of
patience
who
by
reason
of
ties
or
duty
have
endured
it
in
silk
yarn
cotton
lisle
thread
or
woollen
does
not
the
new
canto
belong
the
next
day
was
labor
day
the
occupations
of
cassidy
and
fink
ceased
for
one
passage
of
the
sun
labor
triumphant
would
parade
and
otherwise
disport
itself
fink
took
cassidy
pattern
down
early
mame
had
on
her
new
silk
waist
even
her
damaged
eye
managed
to
emit
a
holiday
gleam
jack
was
fruitfully
penitent
and
there
was
a
hilarious
scheme
for
the
day
afoot
with
parks
and
picnics
and
pilsener
in
it
a
rising
indignant
jealousy
seized
fink
as
she
returned
to
her
flat
above
oh
happy
mame
with
her
bruises
and
her
balm
but
was
mame
to
have
a
monopoly
of
happiness
surely
martin
fink
was
as
good
a
man
as
jack
cassidy
was
his
wife
to
go
always
unbelabored
and
uncaressed
a
sudden
brilliant
breathless
idea
came
to
fink
she
would
show
mame
that
there
were
husbands
as
able
to
use
their
fists
and
perhaps
to
be
as
tender
afterward
as
any
jack
the
holiday
promised
to
be
a
nominal
one
with
the
finks
fink
had
the
stationary
washtubs
in
the
kitchen
filled
with
a
two
wash
that
had
been
soaking
overnight
fink
sat
in
his
stockinged
feet
reading
a
newspaper
thus
labor
day
presaged
to
speed
jealousy
surged
high
in
fink
heart
and
higher
still
surged
an
audacious
resolve
if
her
man
would
not
strike
her
if
he
would
not
so
far
prove
his
manhood
his
prerogative
and
his
interest
in
conjugal
affairs
he
must
be
prompted
to
his
duty
fink
lit
his
pipe
and
peacefully
rubbed
an
ankle
with
a
stockinged
toe
he
reposed
in
the
state
of
matrimony
like
a
lump
of
unblended
suet
in
a
pudding
this
was
his
level
elysium
to
sit
at
ease
vicariously
girdling
the
world
in
print
amid
the
wifely
splashing
of
suds
and
the
agreeable
smells
of
breakfast
dishes
departed
and
dinner
ones
to
come
many
ideas
were
far
from
his
mind
but
the
furthest
one
was
the
thought
of
beating
his
wife
fink
turned
on
the
hot
water
and
set
the
washboards
in
the
suds
up
from
the
flat
below
came
the
gay
laugh
of
cassidy
it
sounded
like
a
taunt
a
flaunting
of
her
own
happiness
in
the
face
of
the
unslugged
bride
above
now
was
fink
time
suddenly
she
turned
like
a
fury
upon
the
man
reading
you
lazy
loafer
she
cried
must
i
work
my
arms
off
washing
and
toiling
for
the
ugly
likes
of
you
are
you
a
man
or
are
you
a
kitchen
hound
fink
dropped
his
paper
motionless
from
surprise
she
feared
that
he
would
not
strike
that
the
provocation
had
been
insufficient
she
leaped
at
him
and
struck
him
fiercely
in
the
face
with
her
clenched
hand
in
that
instant
she
felt
a
thrill
of
love
for
him
such
as
she
had
not
felt
for
many
a
day
rise
up
martin
fink
and
come
into
your
kingdom
oh
she
must
feel
the
weight
of
his
hand
now
just
to
show
that
he
cared
just
to
show
that
he
cared
fink
sprang
to
his
feet
maggie
caught
him
again
on
the
jaw
with
a
wide
swing
of
her
other
hand
she
closed
her
eyes
in
that
fearful
blissful
moment
before
his
blow
should
come
she
whispered
his
name
to
herself
she
leaned
to
the
expected
shock
hungry
for
it
in
the
flat
below
cassidy
with
a
shamed
and
contrite
face
was
powdering
mame
eye
in
preparation
for
their
junket
from
the
flat
above
came
the
sound
of
a
woman
voice
a
bumping
a
stumbling
and
a
shuffling
a
chair
overturned
unmistakable
sounds
of
domestic
conflict
mart
and
mag
scrapping
postulated
cassidy
did
know
they
ever
indulged
shall
i
trot
up
and
see
if
they
need
a
sponge
holder
one
of
cassidy
eyes
sparkled
like
a
diamond
the
other
twinkled
at
least
like
paste
oh
oh
she
said
softly
and
without
apparent
meaning
in
the
feminine
ejaculatory
manner
i
wonder
if
wonder
if
wait
jack
till
i
go
up
and
see
up
the
stairs
she
sped
as
her
foot
struck
the
hallway
above
out
from
the
kitchen
door
of
her
flat
wildly
flounced
fink
oh
maggie
cried
cassidy
in
a
delighted
whisper
did
he
oh
did
he
fink
ran
and
laid
her
face
upon
her
chum
shoulder
and
sobbed
hopelessly
cassidy
took
maggie
face
between
her
hands
and
lifted
it
gently
it
was
flushing
and
paling
but
its
velvety
becomingly
freckled
surface
was
unscratched
unbruised
unmarred
by
the
recreant
fist
of
fink
tell
me
maggie
pleaded
mame
or
i
go
in
there
and
find
out
what
was
it
did
he
hurt
you
what
did
he
do
fink
face
went
down
again
despairingly
on
the
bosom
of
her
friend
for
god
sake
do
open
that
door
mame
she
sobbed
and
ever
tell
nobody
keep
it
under
your
hat
he
he
never
touched
me
and
he
oh
gawd
he
washin
the
clothes
he
washin
the
clothes
the
guilty
party
a
unshaven
untidy
man
sat
in
a
rocking
chair
by
a
window
he
had
just
lighted
a
pipe
and
was
puffing
blue
clouds
with
great
satisfaction
he
had
removed
his
shoes
and
donned
a
pair
of
blue
faded
with
the
morbid
thirst
of
the
confirmed
daily
news
drinker
he
awkwardly
folded
back
the
pages
of
an
evening
paper
eagerly
gulping
down
the
strong
black
headlines
to
be
followed
as
a
chaser
by
the
milder
details
of
the
smaller
type
in
an
adjoining
room
a
woman
was
cooking
supper
odors
from
strong
bacon
and
boiling
coffee
contended
against
the
fumes
from
the
vespertine
pipe
outside
was
one
of
those
crowded
streets
of
the
east
side
in
which
as
twilight
falls
satan
sets
up
his
recruiting
office
a
mighty
host
of
children
danced
and
ran
and
played
in
the
street
some
in
rags
some
in
clean
white
and
beribboned
some
wild
and
restless
as
young
hawks
some
and
shrinking
some
shrieking
rude
and
sinful
words
some
listening
awed
but
soon
grown
familiar
to
embrace
here
were
the
children
playing
in
the
corridors
of
the
house
of
sin
above
the
playground
forever
hovered
a
great
bird
the
bird
was
known
to
humorists
as
the
stork
but
the
people
of
chrystie
street
were
better
ornithologists
they
called
it
a
vulture
a
little
girl
of
twelve
came
up
timidly
to
the
man
reading
and
resting
by
the
window
and
said
papa
wo

a
game
of
checkers
with
me

the
unshaven
untidy

window

a
frown

of

when

home

go
out

snapping
with
the

of
the
baited
and
challenged
he
drew
out
his
roll
and
slapped
five
tens
upon
the
bar
the
three
or
four
young
fellows
who
were
thus
taken
more
slowly
produced
their
stake
the
bartender
stakeholder
took
the
money
laboriously
wrapped
it
recorded
the
bet
with
an
pencil
and
stuffed
the
whole
into
a
corner
of
the
cash
register
and

said
a
bettor
with
anticipatory
glee
that

the
kid
sternly

up
all
around
mike
after
the
round
burke
the
kid
sponge
pal
mentor
and
grand
vizier
drew
him
out
to
the
bootblack
stand
at
the
saloon
corner
where
all
the
official
and
important
matters
of
the
small
hours
social
club
were
settled
as

the
light
tan
shoes
of
the
club
president
and

for

and
wiping

off
on

corner
of

was
a
quiet
sort
of
a
kid

and

speak
without
blushing
she
a
little
spitfire
sometimes
now

the
kid

with
an
annie
i
want
a
suit
of
chain
armor
on
under
my
gladsome
rags
all
right
through
the
land
of
the
wandered
liz
her
black
eyes
searched
the
passing
crowds
fierily
but
vaguely
now
and
then
she
hummed
bars
of
foolish
little
songs
between
times
she
set
her
small
white
teeth
together
and
spake
crisp
words
that
the
east
side
has
added
to
language
liz
skirt
was
green
silk
her
waist
was
a
large
plaid
and
not
without
style
she
wore
a
cluster
ring
of
huge
imitation
rubies
and
a
locket
that
banged
her
knees
at
the
bottom
of
a
silver
chain
her
shoes
were
run
down
over
twisted
high
heels
and
were
strangers
to
polish
her
hat
would
scarcely
have
passed
into
a
flour
barrel
the
family
entrance
of
the
blue
jay
café
received
her
at
a
table
she
sat
and
punched
the
button
with
the
air
of
milady
ringing
for
her
carriage
the
waiter
came
with
his
manner
of
respectful
familiarity
liz
smoothed
her
silken
skirt
with
a
satisfied
wriggle
she
made
the
most
of
it
here
she
could
order
and
be
waited
upon
it
was
all
that
her
world
offered
her
of
the
prerogative
of

the
waiter
smoothly
from
the
narrow
opening
above
his
chin
kid
mullaly
not
the
guy
to
throw
a
lady
like
you
down
seltzer
on
the
side
two
years
repeated
liz
softening
a
little
to
sentiment
under
the
magic
of
the
distiller
art
i
always
used
to
play
out
on
the
street
of
evenin
there
was
nothin
doin
for
me
at
home
for
a
long
time
i
just
sat
on
doorsteps
and
looked
at
the
lights
and
the
people
goin
by
and
then
the
kid
came
along
one
and
sized
me
up
and
i
was
mashed
on
the
spot
for
fair
the
first
drink

i
cut
his
heart
out

it
to
me
another
whiskey
tommy
a
little
unsteadily
but
with
watchful
and
brilliant
eyes
liz
walked
up
the
avenue
on
the
doorstep
of
a
brick
tenement
a
child
sat
puzzling
over
the
convolutions
of
a
tangled
string
liz
flopped
down
beside
her
with
a
crooked
shifting
smile
on
her
flushed
face
but
her
eyes
had
grown
clear
and
artless
of
a
sudden
let
me
show
you
how
to
make
a
kid
she
said
tucking
her
green
silk
skirt
under
her
rusty
shoes
and
while
they
sat
there
the
lights
were
being
turned
on
for
the
dance
in
the
hall
of
the
small
hours
social
club
it
was
the
dance
a
dress
affair
in
which
the
members
took
great
pride
and
bestirred
themselves
huskily
to
further
and
adorn
at
the
president
kid
mullaly
paced
upon
the
floor
with
a
lady
on
his
arm
as
the
loreley
was
her
hair
golden
her
yes
was
softened
to
a
yah
but
its
quality
of
assent
was
patent
to
the
most
milesian
ears
she
stepped
upon
her
own
train
and
blushed
and
she
smiled
into
the
eyes
of
kid
mullaly
and
then
as
the
two
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
waxed
floor
the
thing
happened
to
prevent
which
many
lamps
are
burning
nightly
in
many
studies
and
libraries
out
from
the
circle
of
spectators
in
the
hall
leaped
fate
in
a
green
silk
skirt
under
the
de
of
liz
her
eyes
were
hard
and
blacker
than
jet
she
did
not
scream
or
waver
most
unwomanly
she
cried
out
one
oath
the
kid
own
favorite
oath
and
in
his
own
deep
voice
and
then
while
the
small
hours
social
club
went
frantically
to
pieces
she
made
good
her
boast
to
tommy
the
waiter
made
good
as
far
as
the
length
of
her
knife
blade
and
the
strength
of
her
arm
permitted
and
next
came
the
primal
instinct
of
or
was
it
the
instinct
that
society
has
grafted
on
the
natural
branch
liz
ran
out
and
down
the
street
swift
and
true
as
a
woodcock
flying
through
a
grove
of
saplings
at
dusk
and
then
followed
the
big
city
biggest
shame
its
most
ancient
and
rotten
surviving
canker
its
pollution
and
disgrace
its
blight
and
perversion
its
forever
infamy
and
guilt
fostered
unreproved
and
cherished
handed
down
from
a
century
of
the
basest
barbarity
the
hue
and
cry
nowhere
but
in
the
big
cities
does
it
survive
and
here
most
of
all
where
the
ultimate
perfection
of
culture
citizenship
and
alleged
superiority
joins
bawling
in
the
chase
they
pursued
a
shrieking
mob
of
fathers
mothers
lovers
and
maidens
howling
yelling
calling
whistling
crying
for
blood
well
may
the
wolf
in
the
big
city
stand
outside
the
door
well
may
his
heart
the
gentler
falter
at
the
siege
knowing
her
way
and
hungry
for
her
surcease
she
darted
down
the
familiar
ways
until
at
last
her
feet
struck
the
dull
solidity
of
the
rotting
pier
and
then
it
was
but
a
few
more
panting
steps
and
good
mother
east
river
took
liz
to
her
bosom
soothed
her
muddily
but
quickly
and
settled
in
five
minutes
the
problem
that
keeps
lights
burning
o
nights
in
thousands
of
pastorates
and
colleges
it
mighty
funny
what
kind
of
dreams
one
has
sometimes
poets
call
them
visions
but
a
vision
is
only
a
dream
in
blank
verse
i
dreamed
the
rest
of
this
story
i
thought
i
was
in
the
next
world
i
do
know
how
i
got
there
i
suppose
i
had
been
riding
on
the
ninth
avenue
elevated
or
taking
patent
medicine
or
trying
to
pull
jim
jeffries
nose
or
doing
some
such
little
injudicious
stunt
but
anyhow
there
i
was
and
there
was
a
great
crowd
of
us
outside
the
courtroom
where
the
judgments
were
going
on
and
every
now
and
then
a
very
beautiful
and
imposing
angel
would
come
outside
the
door
and
call
another
case
while
i
was
considering
my
own
worldly
sins
and
wondering
whether
there
would
be
any
use
of
my
trying
to
prove
an
alibi
by
claiming
that
i
lived
in
new
jersey
the
bailiff
angel
came
to
the
door
and
sang
out
case
no
up
stepped
a
man
there
were
lots
of
there
dressed
exactly
like
preachers
and
hustling
us
spirits
around
just
like
cops
do
on
earth
and
by
the
arm
he
dragged
whom
do
you
think
why
liz
the
court
officer
took
her
inside
and
closed
the
door
i
went
up
to
and
inquired
about
the
case
a
very
sad
one
says
he
laying
the
points
of
his
manicured
fingers
together
an
utterly
incorrigible
girl
i
am
special
terrestrial
officer
the
reverend
jones
the
case
was
assigned
to
me
the
girl
murdered
her
fiance
and
committed
suicide
she
had
no
defense
my
report
to
the
court
relates
the
facts
in
detail
all
of
which
are
substantiated
by
reliable
witnesses
the
wages
of
sin
is
death
praise
the
lord
the
court
officer
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
poor
girl
said
special
terrestrial
officer
the
reverend
jones
with
a
tear
in
his
eye
it
was
one
of
the
saddest
cases
that
i
ever
met
with
of
course
she
was
discharged
said
the
court
officer
come
here
jonesy
first
thing
you
know
you
be
switched
to
the
squad
how
would
you
like
to
be
on
the
missionary
force
in
the
south
sea
islands
hey
now
you
quit
making
these
false
arrests
or
be
transferred
see
the
guilty
party
you
not
to
look
for
in
this
case
is
a
unshaven
untidy
man
sitting
by
the
window
reading
in
his
stocking
feet
while
his
children
play
in
the
streets
get
a
move
on
you
now
was
that
a
silly
dream
according
to
their
lights
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
the
big
city
where
the
unquiet
dregs
are
forever
being
shaken
together
young
murray
and
the
captain
had
met
and
become
friends
both
were
at
the
lowest
ebb
possible
to
their
fortunes
both
had
fallen
from
at
least
an
intermediate
heaven
of
respectability
and
importance
and
both
were
typical
products
of
the
monstrous
and
peculiar
social
curriculum
of
their
overweening
and
bumptious
civic
alma
mater
the
captain
was
no
longer
a
captain
one
of
those
sudden
moral
cataclysms
that
sometimes
sweep
the
city
had
hurled
him
from
a
high
and
profitable
position
in
the
police
department
ripping
off
his
badge
and
buttons
and
washing
into
the
hands
of
his
lawyers
the
solid
pieces
of
real
estate
that
his
frugality
had
enabled
him
to
accumulate
the
passing
of
the
flood
left
him
low
and
dry
one
month
after
his
dishabilitation
a
plucked
him
by
the
neck
from
his
counter
as
a
tabby
plucks
a
strange
kitten
from
her
nest
and
cast
him
asphaltward
this
seems
low
enough
but
after
that
he
acquired
a
pair
of
cloth
top
button
congress
gaiters
and
wrote
complaining
letters
to
the
newspapers
and
then
he
fought
the
attendant
at
the
municipal
lodging
house
who
tried
to
give
him
a
bath
when
murray
first
saw
him
he
was
holding
the
hand
of
an
italian
woman
who
sold
apples
and
garlic
on
essex
street
and
quoting
the
words
of
a
song
book
ballad
murray
fall
had
been
more
luciferian
if
less
spectacular
all
the
pretty
tiny
little
kickshaws
of
gotham
had
once
been
his
the
megaphone
man
roars
out
at
you
to
observe
the
house
of
his
uncle
on
a
grand
and
revered
avenue
but
there
had
been
an
awful
row
about
something
and
the
prince
had
been
escorted
to
the
door
by
the
butler
which
in
said
avenue
is
equivalent
to
the
impact
of
the
avuncular
shoe
a
weak
prince
hal
without
inheritance
or
sword
he
drifted
downward
to
meet
his
humorless
falstaff
and
to
pick
the
crusts
of
the
streets
with
him
one
evening
they
sat
on
a
bench
in
a
little
downtown
park
the
great
bulk
of
the
captain
which
starvation
seemed
to
increase
drawing
irony
instead
of
pity
to
his
petitions
for
aid
was
heaped
against
the
arm
of
the
bench
in
a
shapeless
mass
his
red
face
spotted
by
tufts
of
vermilion
whiskers
and
topped
by
a
sagging
white
straw
hat
looked
in
the
gloom
like
one
of
those
structures
that
you
may
observe
in
a
dark
third
avenue
window
challenging
your
imagination
to
say
whether
it
be
something
recent
in
the
way
of
ladies
hats
or
a
strawberry
shortcake
a
belt
last
relic
of
his
official
spruceness
made
a
deep
furrow
in
his
circumference
the
captain
shoes
were
buttonless
in
a
smothered
bass
he
cursed
his
star
of
murray
at
his
side
was
shrunk
into
his
dingy
and
ragged
suit
of
blue
serge
his
hat
was
pulled
low
he
sat
quiet
and
a
little
indistinct
like
some
ghost
that
had
been
dispossessed
i
hungry
growled
the
captain
by
the
top
sirloin
of
the
bull
of
bashan
i
starving
to
death
right
now
i
could
eat
a
bowery
restaurant
clear
through
to
the
stovepipe
in
the
alley
you
think
of
nothing
murray
you
sit
there
with
your
shoulders
scrunched
up
giving
an
imitation
of
reginald
vanderbilt
driving
his
coach
what
good
are
them
airs
doing
you
now
think
of
some
place
we
can
get
something
to
chew
you
forget
my
dear
captain
said
murray
without
moving
that
our
last
attempt
at
dining
was
at
my
suggestion
you
bet
it
was
groaned
the
captain
you
bet
your
life
it
was
have
you
got
any
more
like
that
to
make
hey
i
admit
we
failed
sighed
murray
i
was
sure
malone
would
be
good
for
one
more
free
lunch
after
the
way
he
talked
baseball
with
me
the
last
time
i
spent
a
nickel
in
his
establishment
i
had
this
hand
said
the
captain
extending
the
unfortunate
member
i
had
this
hand
on
the
drumstick
of
a
turkey
and
two
sardine
sandwiches
when
them
waiters
grabbed
us
i
was
within
two
inches
of
the
olives
said
murray
stuffed
olives
i
have
tasted
one
in
a
year
what
we
do
grumbled
the
captain
we
ca
starve
ca
we
said
murray
quietly
i
glad
to
hear
that
i
was
afraid
we
could
you
wait
here
said
the
captain
rising
heavily
and
puffily
to
his
feet
i
going
to
try
to
make
one
more
turn
you
stay
here
till
i
come
back
murray
i
wo
be
over
half
an
hour
if
i
turn
the
trick
i
come
back
flush
he
made
some
elephantine
attempts
at
smartening
his
appearance
he
gave
his
fiery
mustache
a
heavenward
twist
he
dragged
into
sight
a
pair
of
cuffs
deepened
the
crease
in
his
middle
by
tightening
his
belt
another
hole
and
set
off
jaunty
as
a
zoo
rhinoceros
across
the
south
end
of
the
park
when
he
was
out
of
sight
murray
also
left
the
park
hurrying
swiftly
eastward
he
stopped
at
a
building
whose
steps
were
flanked
by
two
green
lights
a
police
captain
named
maroney
he
said
to
the
desk
sergeant
was
dismissed
from
the
force
after
being
tried
under
charges
three
years
ago
i
believe
sentence
was
suspended
is
this
man
wanted
now
by
the
police
why
are
ye
asking
inquired
the
sergeant
with
a
frown
i
thought
there
might
be
a
reward
standing
explained
murray
easily
i
know
the
man
well
he
seems
to
be
keeping
himself
pretty
shady
at
present
i
could
lay
my
hands
on
him
at
any
time
if
there
should
be
a
reward
there
no
reward
interrupted
the
sergeant
shortly
the
not
wanted
and
neither
are
ye
so
get
out
ye
are
frindly
with
um
and
ye
would
be
selling
um
out
with
ye
quick
or
i
give
ye
a
start
murray
gazed
at
the
officer
with
serene
and
virtuous
dignity
i
would
be
simply
doing
my
duty
as
a
citizen
and
gentleman
he
said
severely
if
i
could
assist
the
law
in
laying
hold
of
one
of
its
offenders
murray
hurried
back
to
the
bench
in
the
park
he
folded
his
arms
and
shrank
within
his
clothes
to
his
presentment
ten
minutes
afterward
the
captain
arrived
at
the
rendezvous
windy
and
thunderous
as
a
in
kansas
his
collar
had
been
torn
away
his
straw
hat
had
been
twisted
and
battered
his
shirt
with
stripes
split
to
the
waist
and
from
head
to
knee
he
was
drenched
with
some
vile
and
ignoble
greasy
fluid
that
loudly
proclaimed
to
the
nose
its
component
leaven
of
garlic
and
kitchen
stuff
for
heaven
sake
captain
sniffed
murray
i
doubt
that
i
would
have
waited
for
you
if
i
had
suspected
you
were
so
desperate
as
to
resort
to
swill
barrels
i
cheese
it
said
the
captain
harshly
i
not
hogging
it
yet
it
all
on
the
outside
i
went
around
on
essex
and
proposed
marriage
to
that
catrina
that
got
the
fruit
shop
there
now
that
business
could
be
built
up
she
a
peach
as
far
as
a
dago
could
be
i
thought
i
had
that
senoreena
mashed
sure
last
week
but
look
what
she
done
to
me
i
guess
i
got
too
fresh
well
there
another
scheme
queered
you
do
mean
to
say
said
murray
with
infinite
contempt
that
you
would
have
married
that
woman
to
help
yourself
out
of
your
disgraceful
troubles
me
said
the
captain
i
marry
the
empress
of
china
for
one
bowl
of
chop

a
plate
of
beef

i
steal
a
wafer
from
a
waif
i
be
a
mormon
for
a
bowl
of
chowder

said
murray
resting
his
head
on
his
hands
that
i
would
play
judas
for
the
price
of
one
drink
of
whiskey
for
thirty
pieces
of
silver
i
would
oh

exclaimed
the
captain
in
dismay
you
would
do
that
murray
i
always
thought
that
kike
squeal
on
his
boss
was
about
the
play
that
ever
happened
a
man
that
gives
his
friend
away
is
worse
than
a
pirate
through
the
park
stepped
a
large
man
scanning
the
benches
where
the
electric
light
fell
is
that

said
halting
before

a
few
minutes
mac
the
captain
lifted
himself
with
a
grunt
of
alacrity
if
charlie
finnegan
had
come
down
in
the
bottomless
pit
to
seek
him
there
must
be
something
doing
charlie
guided
him
by
an
arm
into
a
patch
of
shadow

stand
and

began
the
captain
wait
a
minute
said
finnegan
a
bundle
of
yellowish
stuff
came
out
of
his
inside
pocket
five
hundred
dollars
in
it
for
you
on
the
spot
and
the
rest
he
was
my
friend
i

the
captain
i
see
you

the
gang

the
flames
of

before

pickering
i
down
and
out
but
no
traitor
to
a
man
that

friend

captain
voice
rose
and
boomed
like
a
split
trombone

out
of
this
park
charlie
finnegan
where
us
thieves
and
tramps
and
boozers
are
your
betters
and
take
your
dirty
money
with
you
finnegan
drifted
out
by
another
walk
the
captain
returned
to
his
seat
i
could
avoid
hearing
said
murray
drearily
i
think
you
are
the
biggest
fool
i
ever
saw
what
would
you
have
done
asked
the
captain
nailed
pickering
to
the
cross
said
murray
sonny
said
the
captain
huskily
and
without
heat
you
and
me
are
different
new
york
is
divided
into
two
parts
above
street
and
below
fourteenth
you
come
from
the
other
part
we
both
act
according
to
our
lights
an
illuminated
clock
above
the
trees
retailed
the
information
that
it
lacked
the
half
hour
of
twelve
both
men
rose
from
the
bench
and
moved
away
together
as
if
seized
by
the
same
idea
they
left
the
park
struck
through
a
narrow
cross
street
and
came
into
broadway
at
this
hour
as
dark
echoing
and
as
a
byway
in
pompeii
northward
they
turned
and
a
policeman
who
glanced
at
their
unkempt
and
slinking
figures
withheld
the
attention
and
suspicion
that
he
would
have
granted
them
at
any
other
hour
and
place
for
on
every
street
in
that
part
of
the
city
other
unkempt
and
slinking
figures
were
shuffling
and
hurrying
toward
a
converging
point
a
point
that
is
marked
by
no
monument
save
that
groove
on
the
pavement
worn
by
tens
of
thousands
of
waiting
feet
at
ninth
street
a
tall
man
wearing
an
opera
hat
alighted
from
a
broadway
car
and
turned
his
face
westward
but
he
saw
murray
pounced
upon
him
and
dragged
him
under
a
street
light
the
captain
lumbered
slowly
to
the
corner
like
a
wounded
bear
and
waited
growling
jerry
cried
the
hatted
one
how
fortunate
i
was
to
begin
a
search

said
murray
my
friend
is
waiting
for
me
i
am
quoting
him
when
i
authorize
you
to
report
that
there
is
doing
good
night
a
wriggling
line
of
waiting
men
extended
from
a
door
in
tenth
street
far
up
broadway
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
pavement
the
captain
and
murray
fell
in
at
the
tail
of
the
quivering
millipede
twenty
feet
longer
than
it
was
last
night
said
murray
looking
up
at
his
measuring
angle
of
grace
church
half
an
hour
growled
the
captain
before
we
get
our
punk
the
city
clocks
began
to
strike
the
bread
line
moved
forward
slowly
its
leathern
feet
sliding
on
the
stones
with
the
sound
of
a
hissing
serpent
as
they
who
had
lived
according
to
their
lights
closed
up
in
the
rear
a
midsummer
knight
dream
the
knights
are
dead
their
swords
are
rust
except
a
few
who
have
to
le
all
the
time
to
raise
the
dust
dear
reader
it
was
summertime
the
sun
glared
down
upon
the
city
with
pitiless
ferocity
it
is
difficult
for
the
sun
to
be
ferocious
and
exhibit
compunction
simultaneously
the
heat
was
oh
bother
thermometers
who
cares
for
standard
measures
anyhow
it
was
so
hot
that
the
roof
gardens
put
on
so
many
extra
waiters
that
you
could
hope
to
get
your
gin
fizz
now
as
soon
as
all
the
other
people
got
theirs
the
hospitals
were
putting
in
extra
cots
for
bystanders
for
when
little
woolly
dogs
loll
their
tongues
out
and
say
woof
woof
at
the
fleas
that
bite
and
nervous
old
black
bombazine
ladies
screech
mad
dog
and
policemen
begin
to
shoot
somebody
is
going
to
get
hurt
the
man
from
pompton
who
always
wears
an
overcoat
in
july
had
turned
up
in
a
broadway
hotel
drinking
hot
scotches
and
enjoying
his
annual
ray
from
the
calcium
philanthropists
were
petitioning
the
legislature
to
pass
a
bill
requiring
builders
to
make
tenement
more
commodious
so
that
families
might
die
all
together
of
the
heat
instead
of
one
or
two
at
a
time
so
many
men
were
telling
you
about
the
number
of
baths
they
took
each
day
that
you
wondered
how
they
got
along
after
the
real
lessee
of
the
apartment
came
back
to
town
and
thanked
for
taking
such
good
care
of
it
the
young
man
who
called
loudly
for
cold
beef
and
beer
in
the
restaurant
protesting
that
roast
pullet
and
burgundy
was
really
too
heavy
for
such
weather
blushed
when
he
met
your
eye
for
you
had
heard
him
all
winter
calling
in
modest
tones
for
the
same
ascetic
viands
soup
pocketbooks
shirt
waists
actors
and
baseball
excuses
grew
thinner
yes
it
was
summertime
a
man
stood
at
street
waiting
for
a
downtown
car
a
man
of
forty
keen
nervous
plainly
dressed
with
a
harassed
look
around
the
eyes
he
wiped
his
forehead
and
laughed
loudly
when
a
fat
man
with
an
outing
look
stopped
and
spoke
with
him
no
siree
he
shouted
with
defiance
and
scorn
none
of
your
old
swamps
and
skyscraper
mountains
without
elevators
for
me
when
i
want
to
get
away
from
hot
weather
i
know
how
to
do
it
new
york
sir
is
the
finest
summer
resort
in
the
country
keep
in
the
shade
and
watch
your
diet
and
do
get
too
far
away
from
an
electric
fan
talk
about
your
adirondacks
and
your
catskills
there
more
solid
comfort
in
the
borough
of
manhattan
than
in
all
the
rest
of
the
country
together
no
siree
no
tramping
up
perpendicular
cliffs
and
being
waked
up
at
in
the
morning
by
a
million
flies
and
eating
canned
goods
straight
from
the
city
for
me
little
old
new
york
will
take
a
few
select
summer
boarders
comforts
and
conveniences
of
homes
that
the
ad
that
i
answer
every
time
you
need
a
vacation
said
the
fat
man
looking
closely
at
the
other
you
have
been
away
from
town
in
years
better
come
with
me
for
two
weeks
anyhow
the
trout
in
the
beaverkill
are
jumping
at
anything
now
that
looks
like
a
fly
harding
writes
me
that
he
landed
a
brown
last
week
nonsense
cried
the
other
man
go
ahead
if
you
like
and
boggle
around
in
rubber
boots
wearing
yourself
out
trying
to
catch
fish
when
i
want
one
i
go
to
a
cool
restaurant
and
order
it
i
laugh
at
you
fellows
whenever
i
think
of
you
hustling
around
in
the
heat
in
the
country
thinking
you
are
having
a
good
time
for
me
father
knickerbocker
little
improved
farm
with
the
big
shady
lane
running
through
the
middle
of
it
the
fat
man
sighed
over
his
friend
and
went
his
way
the
man
who
thought
new
york
was
the
greatest
summer
resort
in
the
country
boarded
a
car
and
went
buzzing
down
to
his
office
on
the
way
he
threw
away
his
newspaper
and
looked
up
at
a
ragged
patch
of
sky
above
the
housetops
three
pounds
he
muttered
absently
and
harding
is
a
liar
i
believe
if
i
could
but
it
impossible
they
got
to
have
another
month
another
month
at
least
in
his
office
the
upholder
of
urban
midsummer
joys
dived
headforemost
into
the
swimming
pool
of
business
adkins
his
clerk
came
and
added
a
spray
of
letters
memoranda
and
telegrams
at
in
the
afternoon
the
busy
man
leaned
back
in
his
office
chair
put
his
feet
on
the
desk
and
mused
aloud
i
wonder
what
kind
of
bait
harding
used
she
was
all
in
white
that
day
and
thereby
compton
lost
a
bet
to
gaines
compton
had
wagered
she
would
wear
light
blue
for
she
knew
that
was
his
favorite
color
and
compton
was
a
millionaire
son
and
that
almost
laid
him
open
to
the
charge
of
betting
on
a
sure
thing
but
white
was
her
choice
and
gaines
held
up
his
head
with
lordly
air
the
little
summer
hotel
in
the
mountains
had
a
lively
crowd
that
year
there
were
two
or
three
young
college
men
and
a
couple
of
artists
and
a
young
naval
officer
on
one
side
on
the
other
there
were
enough
beauties
among
the
young
ladies
for
the
correspondent
of
a
society
paper
to
refer
to
them
as
a
bevy
but
the
moon
among
the
stars
was
mary
sewell
each
one
of
the
young
men
greatly
desired
to
arrange
matters
so
that
he
could
pay
her
millinery
bills
and
fix
the
furnace
and
have
her
do
away
with
the
sewell
part
of
her
name
forever
those
who
could
stay
only
a
week
or
two
went
away
hinting
at
pistols
and
blighted
hearts
but
compton
stayed
like
the
mountains
themselves
for
he
could
afford
it
and
gaines
stayed
because
he
was
a
fighter
and
was
afraid
of
millionaire
sons
and
well
he
adored
the
country
what
do
you
think
miss
mary
he
said
once
i
knew
a
duffer
in
new
york
who
claimed
to
like
it
in
the
summer
time
said
you
could
keep
cooler
there
than
you
could
in
the
woods
was
he
an
awful
silly
i
do
think
i
could
breathe
on
broadway
after
the
of
june
mamma
was
thinking
of
going
back
week
after
next
said
miss
mary
with
a
lovely
frown
but
when
you
think
of
it
said
gaines
there
are
lots
of
jolly
places
in
town
in
the
summer
the
roof
gardens
you
know
and
the
er
the
roof
gardens
deepest
blue
was
the
lake
that
day
the
day
when
they
had
the
mock
tournament
and
the
men
rode
clumsy
farm
horses
around
in
a
glade
in
the
woods
and
caught
curtain
rings
on
the
end
of
a
lance
such
fun
cool
and
dry
as
the
finest
wine
came
the
breath
of
the
shadowed
forest
the
valley
below
was
a
vision
seen
through
an
opal
haze
a
white
mist
from
hidden
falls
blurred
the
green
of
a
hand
breadth
of
tree
tops
down
the
gorge
youth
made
merry
with
young
summer
nothing
on
broadway
like
that
the
villagers
gathered
to
see
the
city
folks
pursue
their
mad
drollery
the
woods
rang
with
the
laughter
of
pixies
and
naiads
and
sprites
gaines
caught
most
of
the
rings
his
was
the
privilege
to
crown
the
queen
of
the
tournament
he
was
the
conquering
knight
as
far
as
the
rings
went
on
his
arm
he
wore
a
white
scarf
compton
wore
light
blue
she
had
declared
her
preference
for
blue
but
she
wore
white
that
day
gaines
looked
about
for
the
queen
to
crown
her
he
heard
her
merry
laugh
as
if
from
the
clouds
she
had
slipped
away
and
climbed
chimney
rock
a
little
granite
bluff
and
stood
there
a
white
fairy
among
the
laurels
fifty
feet
above
their
heads
instantly
he
and
compton
accepted
the
implied
challenge
the
bluff
was
easily
mounted
at
the
rear
but
the
front
offered
small
hold
to
hand
or
foot
each
man
quickly
selected
his
route
and
began
to
climb
a
crevice
a
bush
a
slight
projection
a
vine
or
tree
branch
all
of
these
were
aids
that
counted
in
the
race
it
was
all
foolery
there
was
no
stake
but
there
was
youth
in
it
cross
reader
and
light
hearts
and
something
else
that
miss
clay
writes
so
charmingly
about
gaines
gave
a
great
tug
at
the
root
of
a
laurel
and
pulled
himself
to
miss
mary
feet
on
his
arm
he
carried
the
wreath
of
roses
and
while
the
villagers
and
summer
boarders
screamed
and
applauded
below
he
placed
it
on
the
queen
brow
you
are
a
gallant
knight
said
miss
mary
if
i
could
be
your
true
knight
always
began
gaines
but
miss
mary
laughed
him
dumb
for
compton
scrambled
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
one
minute
behind
time
what
a
twilight
that
was
when
they
drove
back
to
the
hotel
the
opal
of
the
valley
turned
slowly
to
purple
the
dark
woods
framed
the
lake
as
a
mirror
the
tonic
air
stirred
the
very
soul
in
one
the
first
pale
stars
came
out
over
the
mountain
tops
where
yet
a
faint
glow
of
i
beg
your
pardon
gaines
said
adkins
the
man
who
believed
new
york
to
be
the
finest
summer
resort
in
the
world
opened
his
eyes
and
kicked
over
the
mucilage
bottle
on
his
desk
i
i
believe
i
was
asleep
he
said
it
the
heat
said
adkins
it
something
awful
in
the
city
these
nonsense
said
the
other
the
city
beats
the
country
ten
to
one
in
summer
fools
go
out
tramping
in
muddy
brooks
and
wear
themselves
out
trying
to
catch
little
fish
as
long
as
your
finger
stay
in
town
and
keep
comfortable
that
my
idea
some
letters
just
came
said
adkins
i
thought
you
might
like
to
glance
at
them
before
you
go
let
us
look
over
his
shoulder
and
read
just
a
few
lines
of
one
of
them
my
dear
dear
husband
just
received
your
letter
ordering
us
to
stay
another
month
rita
cough
is
almost
gone
johnny
has
simply
gone
wild
like
a
little
indian
will
be
the
making
of
both
children
work
so
hard
and
i
know
that
your
business
can
hardly
afford
to
keep
us
here
so
long
best
man
that
ever
you
always
pretend
that
you
like
the
city
in
summer
trout
fishing
that
you
used
to
be
so
fond
of
and
all
to
keep
us
well
and
happy
come
to
you
if
it
were
not
doing
the
babies
so
much
good
i
stood
last
evening
on
chimney
rock
in
exactly
the
same
spot
where
i
was
when
you
put
the
wreath
of
roses
on
my
head
through
all
the
world
when
you
said
you
would
be
my
true
knight
fifteen
years
ago
dear
just
think
have
always
been
that
to
me
ever
and
ever
mary
the
man
who
said
he
thought
new
york
the
finest
summer
resort
in
the
country
dropped
into
a
café
on
his
way
home
and
had
a
glass
of
beer
under
an
electric
fan
wonder
what
kind
of
a
fly
old
harding
used
he
said
to
himself
the
last
leaf
in
a
little
district
west
of
washington
square
the
streets
have
run
crazy
and
broken
themselves
into
small
strips
called
places
these
places
make
strange
angles
and
curves
one
street
crosses
itself
a
time
or
two
an
artist
once
discovered
a
valuable
possibility
in
this
street
suppose
a
collector
with
a
bill
for
paints
paper
and
canvas
should
in
traversing
this
route
suddenly
meet
himself
coming
back
without
a
cent
having
been
paid
on
account
so
to
quaint
old
greenwich
village
the
art
people
soon
came
prowling
hunting
for
north
windows
and
gables
and
dutch
attics
and
low
rents
then
they
imported
some
pewter
mugs
and
a
chafing
dish
or
two
from
sixth
avenue
and
became
a
colony
at
the
top
of
a
squatty
brick
sue
and
johnsy
had
their
studio
johnsy
was
familiar
for
joanna
one
was
from
maine
the
other
from
california
they
had
met
at
the
of
an
eighth
street
delmonico
and
found
their
tastes
in
art
chicory
salad
and
bishop
sleeves
so
congenial
that
the
joint
studio
resulted
that
was
in
may
in
november
a
cold
unseen
stranger
whom
the
doctors
called
pneumonia
stalked
about
the
colony
touching
one
here
and
there
with
his
icy
fingers
over
on
the
east
side
this
ravager
strode
boldly
smiting
his
victims
by
scores
but
his
feet
trod
slowly
through
the
maze
of
the
narrow
and
places
mr
pneumonia
was
not
what
you
would
call
a
chivalric
old
gentleman
a
mite
of
a
little
woman
with
blood
thinned
by
california
zephyrs
was
hardly
fair
game
for
the
old
duffer
but
johnsy
he
smote
and
she
lay
scarcely
moving
on
her
painted
iron
bedstead
looking
through
the
small
dutch
at
the
blank
side
of
the
next
brick
house
one
morning
the
busy
doctor
invited
sue
into
the
hallway
with
a
shaggy
gray
eyebrow
she
has
one
chance
in
let
us
say
ten
he
said
as
he
shook
down
the
mercury
in
his
clinical
thermometer
and
that
chance
is
for
her
to
want
to
live
this
way
people
have
of
on
the
side
of
the
undertaker
makes
the
entire
pharmacopeia
look
silly
your
little
lady
has
made
up
her
mind
that
she
not
going
to
get
well
has
she
anything
on
her
mind
she
she
wanted
to
paint
the
bay
of
naples
some
day
said
sue
paint
bosh
has
she
anything
on
her
mind
worth
thinking
about
twice
a
man
for
instance
a
man
said
sue
with
a
twang
in
her
voice
is
a
man
worth
but
no
doctor
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
well
it
is
the
weakness
then
said
the
doctor
i
will
do
all
that
science
so
far
as
it
may
filter
through
my
efforts
can
accomplish
but
whenever
my
patient
begins
to
count
the
carriages
in
her
funeral
procession
i
subtract
per
cent
from
the
curative
power
of
medicines
if
you
will
get
her
to
ask
one
question
about
the
new
winter
styles
in
cloak
sleeves
i
will
promise
you
a
chance
for
her
instead
of
one
in
ten
after
the
doctor
had
gone
sue
went
into
the
workroom
and
cried
a
japanese
napkin
to
a
pulp
then
she
swaggered
into
johnsy
room
with
her
drawing
board
whistling
ragtime
johnsy
lay
scarcely
making
a
ripple
under
the
bedclothes
with
her
face
toward
the
window
sue
stopped
whistling
thinking
she
was
asleep
she
arranged
her
board
and
began
a
drawing
to
illustrate
a
magazine
story
young
artists
must
pave
their
way
to
art
by
drawing
pictures
for
magazine
stories
that
young
authors
write
to
pave
their
way
to
literature
as
sue
was
sketching
a
pair
of
elegant
horseshow
riding
trousers
and
a
monocle
on
the
figure
of
the
hero
an
idaho
cowboy
she
heard
a
low
sound
several
times
repeated
she
went
quickly
to
the
bedside
johnsy
eyes
were
open
wide
she
was
looking
out
the
window
and
counting
counting
backward
twelve
she
said
and
a
little
later
eleven
and
then
ten
and
nine
and
then
eight
and
seven
almost
together
sue
looked
solicitously
out
the
window
what
was
there
to
count
there
was
only
a
bare
dreary
yard
to
be
seen
and
the
blank
side
of
the
brick
house
twenty
feet
away
an
old
old
ivy
vine
gnarled
and
decayed
at
the
roots
climbed
half
way
up
the
brick
wall
the
cold
breath
of
autumn
had
stricken
its
leaves
from
the
vine
until
its
skeleton
branches
clung
almost
bare
to
the
crumbling
bricks
what
is
it
dear
asked
sue
six
said
johnsy
in
almost
a
whisper
they
falling
faster
now
three
days
ago
there
were
almost
a
hundred
it
made
my
head
ache
to
count
them
but
now
it
easy
there
goes
another
one
there
are
only
five
left
now
five
what
dear
tell
your
sudie
leaves
on
the
ivy
vine
when
the
last
one
falls
i
must
go
too
i
known
that
for
three
days
did
the
doctor
tell
you
oh
i
never
heard
of
such
nonsense
complained
sue
with
magnificent
scorn
what
have
old
ivy
leaves
to
do
with
your
getting
well
and
you
used
to
love
that
vine
so
you
naughty
girl
do
be
a
goosey
why
the
doctor
told
me
this
morning
that
your
chances
for
getting
well
real
soon
were
let
see
exactly
what
he
said
he
said
the
chances
were
ten
to
one
why
that
almost
as
good
a
chance
as
we
have
in
new
york
when
we
ride
on
the
street
cars
or
walk
past
a
new
building
try
to
take
some
broth
now
and
let
sudie
go
back
to
her
drawing
so
she
can
sell
the
editor
man
with
it
and
buy
port
wine
for
her
sick
child
and
pork
chops
for
her
greedy
self
you
need
get
any
more
wine
said
johnsy
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
out
the
window
there
goes
another
no
i
do
want
any
broth
that
leaves
just
four
i
want
to
see
the
last
one
fall
before
it
gets
dark
then
i
go
too
johnsy
dear
said
sue
bending
over
her
will
you
promise
me
to
keep
your
eyes
closed
and
not
look
out
the
window
until
i
am
done
working
i
must
hand
those
drawings
in
by
i
need
the
light
or
i
would
draw
the
shade
down
could
you
draw
in
the
other
room
asked
johnsy
coldly
i
rather
be
here
by
you
said
sue
besides
i
do
want
you
to
keep
looking
at
those
silly
ivy
leaves
tell
me
as
soon
as
you
have
finished
said
johnsy
closing
her
eyes
and
lying
white
and
still
as
a
fallen
statue
because
i
want
to
see
the
last
one
fall
i
tired
of
waiting
i
tired
of
thinking
i
want
to
turn
loose
my
hold
on
everything
and
go
sailing
down
down
just
like
one
of
those
poor
tired
leaves
try
to
sleep
said
sue
i
must
call
behrman
up
to
be
my
model
for
the
old
hermit
miner
i
not
be
gone
a
minute
do
try
to
move
i
come
back
old
behrman
was
a
painter
who
lived
on
the
ground
floor
beneath
them
he
was
past
sixty
and
had
a
michael
angelo
moses
beard
curling
down
from
the
head
of
a
satyr
along
the
body
of
an
imp
behrman
was
a
failure
in
art
forty
years
he
had
wielded
the
brush
without
getting
near
enough
to
touch
the
hem
of
his
mistress
robe
he
had
been
always
about
to
paint
a
masterpiece
but
had
never
yet
begun
it
for
several
years
he
had
painted
nothing
except
now
and
then
a
daub
in
the
line
of
commerce
or
advertising
he
earned
a
little
by
serving
as
a
model
to
those
young
artists
in
the
colony
who
could
not
pay
the
price
of
a
professional
he
drank
gin
to
excess
and
still
talked
of
his
coming
masterpiece
for
the
rest
he
was
a
fierce
little
old
man
who
scoffed
terribly
at
softness
in
any
one
and
who
regarded
himself
as
especial
to
protect
the
two
young
artists
in
the
studio
above
sue
found
behrman
smelling
strongly
of
juniper
berries
in
his
dimly
lighted
den
below
in
one
corner
was
a
blank
canvas
on
an
easel
that
had
been
waiting
there
for
years
to
receive
the
first
line
of
the
masterpiece
she
told
him
of
johnsy
fancy
and
how
she
feared
she
would
indeed
light
and
fragile
as
a
leaf
herself
float
away
when
her
slight
hold
upon
the
world
grew
weaker
old
behrman
with
his
red
eyes
plainly
streaming
shouted
his
contempt
and
derision
for
such
idiotic
imaginings
vass
he
cried
is
dere
people
in
de
world

foolishness

gott
yes
johnsy
was
sleeping
when
they
went
upstairs
sue
pulled
the
shade
down
to
the
and
motioned
behrman
into
the
other
room
in
there
they
peered
out
the
window
fearfully
at
the
ivy
vine
then
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
without
speaking
a
persistent
cold
rain
was
falling
mingled
with
snow
behrman
in
his
old
blue
shirt
took
his
seat
as
the
on
an
upturned
kettle
for
a
rock
when
sue
awoke
from
an
hour
sleep
the
next
morning
she
found
johnsy
with
dull
eyes
staring
at
the
drawn
green
shade
pull
it
up
i
want
to
see
she
ordered
in
a
whisper
wearily
sue
obeyed
but
lo
after
the
beating
rain
and
fierce
gusts
of
wind
that
had
endured
through
the
livelong
night
there
yet
stood
out
against
the
brick
wall
one
ivy
leaf
it
was
the
last
on
the
vine
still
dark
green
near
its
stem
but
with
its
serrated
edges
tinted
with
the
yellow
of
dissolution
and
decay
it
hung
bravely
from
a
branch
some
twenty
feet
above
the
ground
it
is
the
last
one
said
johnsy
i
thought
it
would
surely
fall
during
the
night
i
heard
the
wind
it
will
fall
and
i
shall
die
at
the
same
time
dear
dear
said
sue
leaning
her
worn
face
down
to
the
pillow
think
of
me
if
you
wo
think
of
yourself
what
would
i
do
but
johnsy
did
not
answer
the
lonesomest
thing
in
all
the
world
is
a
soul
when
it
is
making
ready
to
go
on
its
mysterious
far
journey
the
fancy
seemed
to
possess
her
more
strongly
as
one
by
one
the
ties
that
bound
her
to
friendship
and
to
earth
were
loosed
the
day
wore
away
and
even
through
the
twilight
they
could
see
the
lone
ivy
leaf
clinging
to
its
stem
against
the
wall
and
then
with
the
coming
of
the
night
the
north
wind
was
again
loosed
while
the
rain
still
beat
against
the
windows
and
pattered
down
from
the
low
dutch
eaves
when
it
was
light
enough
johnsy
the
merciless
commanded
that
the
shade
be
raised
the
ivy
leaf
was
still
there
johnsy
lay
for
a
long
time
looking
at
it
and
then
she
called
to
sue
who
was
stirring
her
chicken
broth
over
the
gas
stove
i
been
a
bad
girl
sudie
said
johnsy
something
has
made
that
last
leaf
stay
there
to
show
me
how
wicked
i
was
it
is
a
sin
to
want
to
die
you
may
bring
me
a
little
broth
now
and
some
milk
with
a
little
port
in
it
and
no
bring
me
a
first
and
then
pack
some
pillows
about
me
and
i
will
sit
up
and
watch
you
cook
an
hour
later
she
said
sudie
some
day
i
hope
to
paint
the
bay
of
naples
the
doctor
came
in
the
afternoon
and
sue
had
an
excuse
to
go
into
the
hallway
as
he
left
even
chances
said
the
doctor
taking
sue
thin
shaking
hand
in
his
with
good
nursing
you
win
and
now
i
must
see
another
case
i
have
downstairs
behrman
his
name
is
some
kind
of
an
artist
i
believe
pneumonia
too
he
is
an
old
weak
man
and
the
attack
is
acute
there
is
no
hope
for
him
but
he
goes
to
the
hospital
to
be
made
more
comfortable
the
next
day
the
doctor
said
to
sue
she
out
of
danger
won
nutrition
and
care
now
that
all
and
that
afternoon
sue
came
to
the
bed
where
johnsy
lay
contentedly
knitting
a
very
blue
and
very
useless
woolen
shoulder
scarf
and
put
one
arm
around
her
pillows
and
all
i
have
something
to
tell
you
white
mouse
she
said
behrman
died
of
pneumonia
in
the
hospital
he
was
ill
only
two
days
the
janitor
found
him
on
the
morning
of
the
first
day
in
his
room
downstairs
helpless
with
pain
his
shoes
and
clothing
were
wet
through
and
icy
cold
they
could
imagine
where
he
had
been
on
such
a
dreadful
night
and
then
they
found
a
lantern
still
lighted
and
a
ladder
that
had
been
dragged
from
its
place
and
some
scattered
brushes
and
a
palette
with
green
and
yellow
colors
mixed
on
it
and
look
out
the
window
dear
at
the
last
ivy
leaf
on
the
wall
did
you
wonder
why
it
never
fluttered
or
moved
when
the
wind
blew
ah
darling
it
behrman
masterpiece
he
painted
it
there
the
night
that
the
last
leaf
fell
the
count
and
the
wedding
guest
one
evening
when
andy
donovan
went
to
dinner
at
his
second
avenue
scott
introduced
him
to
a
new
boarder
a
young
lady
miss
conway
miss
conway
was
small
and
unobtrusive
she
wore
a
plain
dress
and
bestowed
her
interest
which
seemed
languid
upon
her
plate
she
lifted
her
diffident
eyelids
and
shot
one
perspicuous
judicial
glance
at
donovan
politely
murmured
his
name
and
returned
to
her
mutton
donovan
bowed
with
the
grace
and
beaming
smile
that
were
rapidly
winning
for
him
social
business
and
political
advancement
and
erased
the
one
from
the
tablets
of
his
consideration
two
weeks
later
andy
was
sitting
on
the
front
steps
enjoying
his
cigar
there
was
a
soft
rustle
behind
and
above
him
and
andy
turned
his
head
and
had
his
head
turned
just
coming
out
the
door
was
miss
conway
she
wore
a
dress
of
oh
this
thin
black
goods
her
hat
was
black
and
from
it
drooped
and
fluttered
an
ebon
veil
filmy
as
a
spider
web
she
stood
on
the
top
step
and
drew
on
black
silk
gloves
not
a
speck
of
white
or
a
spot
of
color
about
her
dress
anywhere
her
rich
golden
hair
was
drawn
with
scarcely
a
ripple
into
a
shining
smooth
knot
low
on
her
neck
her
face
was
plain
rather
than
pretty
but
it
was
now
illuminated
and
made
almost
beautiful
by
her
large
gray
eyes
that
gazed
above
the
houses
across
the
street
into
the
sky
with
an
expression
of
the
most
appealing
sadness
and
melancholy
gather
the
idea
girls
all
black
you
know
with
the
preference
for
oh
de
that
it
all
black
and
that
sad
faraway
look
and
the
hair
shining
under
the
black
veil
you
have
to
be
a
blonde
of
course
and
try
to
look
as
if
although
your
young
life
had
been
blighted
just
as
it
was
about
to
give
a
over
the
threshold
of
life
a
walk
in
the
park
might
do
you
good
and
be
sure
to
happen
out
the
door
at
the
right
moment
and
oh
it
fetch
every
time
but
it
fierce
now
how
cynical
i
am
ai
it
to
talk
about
mourning
costumes
this
way
donovan
suddenly
reinscribed
miss
conway
upon
the
tablets
of
his
consideration
he
threw
away
the
remaining
of
his
cigar
that
would
have
been
good
for
eight
minutes
yet
and
quickly
shifted
his
center
of
gravity
to
his
low
cut
patent
leathers
it
a
fine
clear
evening
miss
conway
he
said
and
if
the
weather
bureau
could
have
heard
the
confident
emphasis
of
his
tones
it
would
have
hoisted
the
square
white
signal
and
nailed
it
to
the
mast
to
them
that
has
the
heart
to
enjoy
it
it
is
donovan
said
miss
conway
with
a
sigh
donovan
in
his
heart
cursed
fair
weather
heartless
weather
it
should
hail
and
blow
and
snow
to
be
consonant
with
the
mood
of
miss
conway
i
hope
none
of
your
relatives
i
hope
you
have
sustained
a
loss
ventured
donovan
death
has
claimed
said
miss
conway
hesitating
not
a
relative
but
one
who
but
i
will
not
intrude
my
grief
upon
you
mr
donovan
intrude
protested
donovan
why
say
miss
conway
i
be
delighted
that
is
i
be
sorry
i
mean
i
sure
nobody
could
sympathize
with
you
truer
than
i
would
miss
conway
smiled
a
little
smile
and
oh
it
was
sadder
than
her
expression
in
repose
and
the
world
laughs
with
you
weep
and
they
give
you
the
laugh
she
quoted
i
have
learned
that
donovan
i
have
no
friends
or
acquaintances
in
this
city
but
you
have
been
kind
to
me
i
appreciate
it
highly
he
had
passed
her
the
pepper
twice
at
the
table
it
tough
to
be
alone
in
new
york
that
a
cinch
said
donovan
but
say
whenever
this
little
old
town
does
loosen
up
and
get
friendly
it
goes
the
limit
say
you
took
a
little
stroll
in
the
park
miss
conway
do
you
think
it
might
chase
away
some
of
your
mullygrubs
and
if
you
allow
me
thanks
donovan
i
be
pleased
to
accept
of
your
escort
if
you
think
the
company
of
one
whose
heart
is
filled
with
gloom
could
be
anyways
agreeable
to
you
through
the
open
gates
of
the
old
downtown
park
where
the
elect
once
took
the
air
they
strolled
and
found
a
quiet
bench
there
is
this
difference
between
the
grief
of
youth
and
that
of
old
age
youth
burden
is
lightened
by
as
much
of
it
as
another
shares
old
age
may
give
and
give
but
the
sorrow
remains
the
same
he
was
my
fiance
confided
miss
conway
at
the
end
of
an
hour
we
were
going
to
be
married
next
spring
i
do
want
you
to
think
that
i
am
stringing
you
donovan
but
he
was
a
real
count
he
had
an
estate
and
a
castle
in
italy
count
fernando
mazzini
was
his
name
i
never
saw
the
beat
of
him
for
elegance
papa
objected
of
course
and
once
we
eloped
but
papa
overtook
us
and
took
us
back
i
thought
sure
papa
and
fernando
would
fight
a
duel
papa
has
a
livery
business
in
you
know
finally
papa
came
all
right
and
said
we
might
be
married
next
spring
fernando
showed
him
proofs
of
his
title
and
wealth
and
then
went
over
to
italy
to
get
the
castle
fixed
up
for
us
very
proud
and
when
fernando
wanted
to
give
me
several
thousand
dollars
for
my
trousseau
he
called
him
down
something
awful
he
would
even
let
me
take
a
ring
or
any
presents
from
him
and
when
fernando
sailed
i
came
to
the
city
and
got
a
position
as
cashier
in
a
candy
store
three
days
ago
i
got
a
letter
from
italy
forwarded
from
saying
that
fernando
had
been
killed
in
a
gondola
accident
that
is
why
i
am
in
mourning
my
heart
donovan
will
remain
forever
in
his
grave
i
guess
i
am
poor
company
donovan
but
i
can
not
take
any
interest
in
no
one
i
should
not
care
to
keep
you
from
gayety
and
your
friends
who
can
smile
and
entertain
you
perhaps
you
would
prefer
to
walk
back
to
the
house
now
girls
if
you
want
to
observe
a
young
man
hustle
out
after
a
pick
and
shovel
just
tell
him
that
your
heart
is
in
some
other
fellow
grave
young
men
are
by
nature
ask
any
widow
something
must
be
done
to
restore
that
missing
organ
to
weeping
angels
in
de
dead
men
certainly
get
the
worst
of
it
from
all
sides
i
awfully
sorry
said
donovan
gently
no
we
wo
walk
back
to
the
house
just
yet
and
do
say
you
have
no
friends
in
this
city
miss
conway
i
awful
sorry
and
i
want
you
to
believe
i
your
friend
and
that
i
awful
sorry
i
got
his
picture
here
in
my
locket
said
miss
conway
after
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
i
never
showed
it
to
anybody
but
i
will
to
you
donovan
because
i
believe
you
to
be
a
true
friend
donovan
gazed
long
and
with
much
interest
at
the
photograph
in
the
locket
that
miss
conway
opened
for
him
the
face
of
count
mazzini
was
one
to
command
interest
it
was
a
smooth
intelligent
bright
almost
a
handsome
face
the
face
of
a
strong
cheerful
man
who
might
well
be
a
leader
among
his
fellows
i
have
a
larger
one
framed
in
my
room
said
miss
conway
when
we
return
i
will
show
you
that
they
are
all
i
have
to
remind
me
of
fernando
but
he
ever
will
be
present
in
my
heart
that
a
sure
thing
a
subtle
task
confronted
donovan
that
of
supplanting
the
unfortunate
count
in
the
heart
of
miss
conway
this
his
admiration
for
her
determined
him
to
do
but
the
magnitude
of
the
undertaking
did
not
seem
to
weigh
upon
his
spirits
the
sympathetic
but
cheerful
friend
was
the
rôle
he
essayed
and
he
played
it
so
successfully
that
the
next
found
them
conversing
pensively
across
two
plates
of
though
yet
there
was
no
diminution
of
the
sadness
in
miss
conway
large
gray
eyes
before
they
parted
in
the
hall
that
evening
she
ran
upstairs
and
brought
down
the
framed
photograph
wrapped
lovingly
in
a
white
silk
scarf
donovan
surveyed
it
with
inscrutable
eyes
he
gave
me
this
the
night
he
left
for
italy
said
miss
conway
i
had
the
one
for
the
locket
made
from
this
a
man
said
donovan
heartily
how
would
it
suit
you
miss
conway
to
give
me
the
pleasure
of
your
company
to
coney
next
sunday
afternoon
a
month
later
they
announced
their
engagement
to
scott
and
the
other
boarders
miss
conway
continued
to
wear
black
a
week
after
the
announcement
the
two
sat
on
the
same
bench
in
the
downtown
park
while
the
fluttering
leaves
of
the
trees
made
a
dim
kinetoscopic
picture
of
them
in
the
moonlight
but
donovan
had
worn
a
look
of
abstracted
gloom
all
day
he
was
so
silent
that
love
lips
could
not
keep
back
any
longer
the
questions
that
heart
propounded
what
the
matter
andy
you
are
so
solemn
and
grouchy
nothing
maggie
i
know
better
ca
i
tell
you
never
acted
this
way
before
what
is
it
it
nothing
much
maggie
yes
it
is
and
i
want
to
know
i
bet
it
some
other
girl
you
are
thinking
about
all
right
why
do
you
go
get
her
if
you
want
her
take
your
arm
away
if
you
please
i
tell
you
then
said
andy
wisely
but
i
guess
you
understand
it
exactly
you
heard
of
mike
sullivan
have
you
mike
sullivan
everybody
calls
him
no
i
have
said
maggie
and
i
do
want
to
if
he
makes
you
act
like
this
who
is
he
he
the
biggest
man
in
new
york
said
andy
almost
reverently
he
can
about
do
anything
he
wants
to
with
tammany
or
any
other
old
thing
in
the
political
line
he
a
mile
high
and
as
broad
as
east
river
you
say
anything
against
big
mike
and
you
have
a
million
men
on
your
collarbone
in
about
two
seconds
why
he
made
a
visit
over
to
the
old
country
awhile
back
and
the
kings
took
to
their
holes
like
rabbits
well
big
mike
a
friend
of
mine
i
ai
more
than
in
the
district
as
far
as
influence
goes
but
mike
as
good
a
friend
to
a
little
man
or
a
poor
man
as
he
is
to
a
big
one
i
met
him
on
the
bowery
and
what
do
you
think
he
does
comes
up
and
shakes
hands
says
he
been
keeping
cases
on
you
you
been
putting
in
some
good
licks
over
on
your
side
of
the
street
and
i
proud
of
you
what
you
take
to
drink
he
takes
a
cigar
and
i
take
a
highball
i
told
him
i
was
going
to
get
married
in
two
weeks
says
he
me
an
invitation
so
i
keep
in
mind
of
it
and
i
come
to
the
wedding
that
what
big
mike
says
to
me
and
he
always
does
what
he
says
you
do
understand
it
maggie
but
i
have
one
of
my
hands
cut
off
to
have
big
mike
sullivan
at
our
wedding
it
would
be
the
proudest
day
of
my
life
when
he
goes
to
a
man
wedding
there
a
guy
being
married
that
made
for
life
now
that
why
i
maybe
looking
sore
why
do
you
invite
him
then
if
he
so
much
to
the
mustard
said
maggie
lightly
there
a
reason
why
i
ca
said
andy
sadly
there
a
reason
why
he
must
be
there
do
ask
me
what
it
is
for
i
ca
tell
you
oh
i
do
care
said
maggie
it
something
about
politics
of
course
but
it
no
reason
why
you
ca
smile
at
me
maggie
said
andy
presently
do
you
think
as
much
of
me
as
you
did
of
your
as
you
did
of
the
count
mazzini
he
waited
a
long
time
but
maggie
did
not
reply
and
then
suddenly
she
leaned
against
his
shoulder
and
began
to
cry
to
cry
and
shake
with
sobs
holding
his
arm
tightly
and
wetting
the
de
with
tears
there
there
there
soothed
andy
putting
aside
his
own
trouble
and
what
is
it
now
andy
sobbed
maggie
i
lied
to
you
and
you
never
marry
me
or
love
me
any
more
but
i
feel
that
i
got
to
tell
andy
there
never
was
so
much
as
the
little
finger
of
a
count
i
never
had
a
beau
in
my
life
but
all
the
other
girls
had
and
they
talked
about
and
that
seemed
to
make
the
fellows
like
more
and
andy
i
look
swell
in
black
you
know
i
do
so
i
went
out
to
a
photograph
store
and
bought
that
picture
and
had
a
little
one
made
for
my
locket
and
made
up
all
that
story
about
the
count
and
about
his
being
killed
so
i
could
wear
black
and
nobody
can
love
a
liar
and
you
shake
me
andy
and
i
die
for
shame
oh
there
never
was
anybody
i
liked
but
you
and
that
all
but
instead
of
being
pushed
away
she
found
andy
arm
folding
her
closer
she
looked
up
and
saw
his
face
cleared
and
smiling
could
you
could
you
forgive
me
andy
sure
said
andy
it
all
right
about
that
back
to
the
cemetery
for
the
count
you
straightened
everything
out
maggie
i
was
in
hopes
you
would
before
the
bully
girl
andy
said
maggie
with
a
somewhat
shy
smile
after
she
had
been
thoroughly
assured
of
forgiveness
did
you
believe
all
that
story
about
the
count
well
not
to
any
large
extent
said
andy
reaching
for
his
cigar
case
because
it
big
mike
sullivan
picture
you
got
in
that
locket
of
yours
the
country
of
elusion
the
cunning
writer
will
choose
an
indefinable
subject
for
he
can
then
set
down
his
theory
of
what
it
is
and
next
at
length
his
conception
of
what
it
is
not
and
lo
his
paper
is
covered
therefore
let
us
follow
the
prolix
and
unmapable
trail
into
that
mooted
country
bohemia
grainger
of
closed
his
desk
put
on
his
hat
walked
into
the
hall
punched
the
down
button
and
waited
for
the
elevator
grainger
day
had
been
trying
the
chief
had
tried
to
ruin
the
magazine
a
dozen
times
by
going
against
grainger
ideas
for
running
it
a
lady
whose
grandfather
had
fought
with
mcclellan
had
brought
a
portfolio
of
poems
in
person
grainger
was
curator
of
the
lion
house
of
the
magazine
that
day
he
had
lunched
an
arctic
explorer
a
writer
and
the
famous
conductor
of
a
expose
consequently
his
mind
was
in
a
whirl
of
icebergs
maupassant
and
trichinosis
but
there
was
a
surcease
and
a
recourse
there
was
bohemia
he
would
seek
distraction
there
and
let
see
he
would
call
by
for
mary
adrian
half
an
hour
later
he
threaded
his
way
like
a
brazilian
through
the
palm
forest
in
the
tiled
entrance
hall
of
the
idealia
one
day
the
christeners
of
and
the
cognominators
of
will
meet
and
there
will
be
some
jealous
and
sanguinary
knifing
the
clerk
breathed
grainger
name
so
languidly
into
the
house
telephone
that
it
seemed
it
must
surely
drop
from
sheer
inertia
down
to
the
janitor
regions
but
at
length
it
soared
dilatorily
up
to
miss
adrian
ear
certainly
grainger
was
to
come
up
immediately
a
colored
maid
with
an
expression
opened
the
door
of
the
apartment
for
him
grainger
walked
sideways
down
the
narrow
hall
a
bunch
of
burnt
umber
hair
and
a
eye
appeared
in
the
crack
of
a
door
a
long
white
undraped
arm
came
out
barring
the
way
so
glad
you
came
ricky
instead
of
any
of
the
others
said
the
eye
light
a
cigarette
and
give
it
to
me
going
to
take
me
to
dinner
fine
go
into
the
front
room
till
i
finish
dressing
but
do
sit
in
your
usual
chair
there
pie
in
it
meringue
kappelman
threw
it
at
reeves
last
evening
while
he
was
reciting
sophy
has
just
come
to
straighten
up
is
it
lit
thanks
scotch
on
the
mantel
oh
no
it
is
that
chartreuse
ask
sophy
to
find
you
some
i
wo
be
long
grainger
escaped
the
meringue
as
he
waited
his
spirits
sank
still
lower
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
as
vapid
as
a
zephyr
wandering
over
a
vesuvian
relics
of
some
feast
lay
about
the
room
scattered
in
places
where
even
a
prowling
cat
would
have
been
surprised
to
find
them
a
straggling
cluster
of
deep
red
roses
in
a
marmalade
jar
bowed
their
heads
over
tobacco
ashes
and
unwashed
goblets
a
stood
on
the
piano
a
leaf
of
sheet
music
supported
a
stack
of
sandwiches
in
a
chair
mary
came
in
dressed
and
radiant
her
gown
was
of
that
thin
black
fabric
whose
name
through
the
change
of
a
single
vowel
seems
to
summon
visions
ranging
between
the
extremes
of
man
experience
spelled
with
an
ê
it
belongs
to
gallic
witchery
and
diaphanous
dreams
with
an
a
it
drapes
lamentation
and
woe
that
evening
they
went
to
the
café
andré
and
as
people
would
confide
to
you
in
a
whisper
that
andré
was
the
only
truly
bohemian
restaurant
in
town
it
may
be
well
to
follow
them
andré
began
his
professional
career
as
a
waiter
in
a
bowery
had
you
seen
him
there
you
would
have
called
him
tough
to
yourself
not
aloud
for
he
would
have
soaked
you
as
quickly
as
he
would
have
soaked
his
thumb
in
your
coffee
he
saved
money
and
started
a
basement
in
eighth
or
ninth
street
one
afternoon
andré
drank
too
much
absinthe
he
announced
to
his
startled
family
that
he
was
the
grand
llama
of
thibet
therefore
requiring
an
empty
audience
hall
in
which
to
be
worshiped
he
moved
all
the
tables
and
chairs
from
the
restaurant
into
the
back
yard
wrapped
a
red
around
himself
and
sat
on
a
for
a
throne
when
the
diners
began
to
arrive
madame
in
a
flurry
of
despair
laid
cloths
and
ushered
them
trembling
outside
between
the
tables
were
stretched
bearing
the
family
a
party
of
bohemia
hunters
greeted
the
artistic
innovation
with
shrieks
and
acclamations
of
delight
that
week
washing
was
not
taken
in
for
two
years
when
andré
came
to
his
senses
he
had
the
menu
printed
on
stiffly
starched
cuffs
and
served
the
ices
in
little
wooden
tubs
next
he
took
down
his
sign
and
darkened
the
front
of
the
house
when
you
went
there
to
dine
you
fumbled
for
an
electric
button
and
pressed
it
a
lookout
slid
open
a
panel
in
the
door
looked
at
you
suspiciously
and
asked
if
you
were
acquainted
with
senator
herodotus
mcmilligan
of
the
chickasaw
nation
if
you
were
you
were
admitted
and
allowed
to
dine
if
you
were
not
you
were
admitted
and
allowed
to
dine
there
you
have
one
of
the
abiding
principles
of
bohemia
when
andré
had
accumulated
he
moved
near
broadway
in
the
fierce
light
that
beats
upon
the
there
we
find
him
and
leave
him
with
customers
in
pearls
and
automobile
veils
striving
to
catch
his
excellently
graduated
nod
of
recognition
there
is
a
large
round
table
in
the
northeast
corner
of
andré
at
which
six
can
sit
to
this
table
grainger
and
mary
adrian
made
their
way
kappelman
and
reeves
were
already
there
and
miss
tooker
who
designed
the
may
cover
for
the
notathome
and
pothunter
who
never
drank
anything
but
black
and
white
highballs
being
in
mourning
for
her
husband
who
oh
i
forgotten
what
he
did
died
like
as
not
reader
wouldst
take
one
peep
into
the
fair
land
of
bohemia
then
look
and
when
you
think
you
have
seen
it
you
have
not
and
it
is
neither
thimbleriggery
nor
astigmatism
the
walls
of
the
café
andré
were
covered
with
original
sketches
by
the
artists
who
furnished
much
of
the
color
and
sound
of
the
place
fair
woman
furnished
the
theme
for
the
bulk
of
the
drawings
when
you
say
sirens
and
siphons
you
come
near
to
estimating
the
alliterative
atmosphere
of
andré
first
i
want
you
to
meet
my
friend
miss
adrian
miss
tooker
and
pothunter

already
know
while
she
tucks
in
the
fingers
of
her
elbow
gloves
you
shall
have
her
daguerreotype
so
faint
and
uncertain
shall
the
portrait
be
age
somewhere
between
and
highneck

large
bunches

the
fearful
word
may
mean

she
let
reeves
squeeze
her
hand
after
he
recited
one
of
his
poems
but
she
counted
the
change
after
sending
him
out
with
a
dollar
to
buy
some
pickled
pig
feet
deportment
out
of
a
possible
morals
mary
was
one
of
the
princesses
of
bohemia
in
the
first
place
it
was
a
royal
and
a
daring
thing
to
have
been
named
mary
there
are
twenty
fifines
and
heloises
to
one
mary

country
of

times
felt
his

to
make
sure
that
his
latest
poem
is
in
the
pocket
it
had
been
neatly
typewritten
but
he
has
copied
it
on
the
backs
of
letters
with
a
pencil

you

you

how
the

keeps
up

kipling
with

with

the
slapsticks
with

between

was
the
pucker
that

intense

it

from
her

to
her
mouth
to
hold
her
own
not
a
chance
must
be

a
sentence
addressed
to

be
as
a

each

of

a

which

miss

with
an
elbow
to

leaned
across
the
table
toward
grainger
upsetting
her
glass
of
wine
now
while
you
are
fed
and
in
good
humor
she
said
i
want
to
make
a
suggestion
to
you
about
a
new
cover
a
good
idea
said
grainger
mopping
the
tablecloth
with
his
napkin
i
speak
to
the
waiter
about
it
kappelman
the
painter
was
the
as
a
piece
of
delicate
athenian
wit
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
waltzed
down
the
room
with
a
waiter
that
dependent
no
doubt
an
honest
pachydermatous
worthy
biped
released
himself
from
the
unequal
encounter
carried
his
professional
smile
back
to
the
and
dropped
it
down
the
shaft
to
eternal
oblivion
reeves
began
to
make
keats
turn
in
his
grave
pothunter
told
the
story
of
the
man
who
met
the
widow
on
the
train
miss
adrian
hummed
what
is
still
called
a
in
the
cafés
of
bridgeport
grainger
edited
each
individual
effort
with
his
assistant
smile
which
meant
great
but
you
have
to
send
them
in
through
the
regular
channels
if
i
were
the
chief
now
but
you
know
how
it
is
and
soon
the
head
waiter
bowed
before
them
desolated
to
relate
that
the
closing
hour
had
already
become
chronologically
historical
so
out
all
trooped
into
the
starry
midnight
filling
the
street
with
gay
laughter
to
be
barked
at
by
hopeful
cabmen
and
enviously
eyed
by
the
dull
inhabitants
of
an
uninspired
world
grainger
left
mary
at
the
elevator
in
the
trackless
palm
forest
of
the
idealia
after
he
had
gone
she
came
down
again
carrying
a
small
for
a
cab
drove
to
the
grand
central
station
boarded
a
commuter
train
rode
four
hours
with
her
head
bobbing
against
the
back
of
the
seat
and
landed
during
a
fresh
stinging
glorious
sunrise
at
a
deserted
station
the
size
of
a
peach
crate
called
crocusville
she
walked
a
mile
and
clicked
the
latch
of
a
gate
a
bare
brown
cottage
stood
twenty
yards
back
an
old
man
with
a
calvinistic
face
and
clothes
dyed
blacker
than
a
raven
in
a
was
washing
his
hands
in
a
tin
basin
on
the
front
porch
how
are
you
father
said
mary
timidly
i
am
as
well
as
providence
permits
mary
ann
you
will
find
your
mother
in
the
kitchen
in
the
kitchen
a
cryptic
gray
woman
kissed
her
glacially
on
the
forehead
and
pointed
out
the
potatoes
which
were
not
yet
peeled
for
breakfast
mary
sat
in
a
wooden
chair
and
decorticated
spuds
with
a
thrill
in
her
heart
for
breakfast
there
were
grace
cold
bread
potatoes
bacon
and
tea
you
are
pursuing
the
same
avocation
in
the
city
concerning
which
you
have
advised
us
from
time
to
time
by
letter
i
trust
said
her
father
yes
said
mary
i
am
still
reviewing
books
for
the
same
publication
after
breakfast
she
helped
wash
the
dishes
and
then
all
three
sat
in
chairs
in
the
parlor
it
is
my
custom
said
the
old
man
on
the
sabbath
day
to
read
aloud
from
the
great
work
entitled
the
for
authorized
and
set
forms
of
liturgy
by
the
ecclesiastical
philosopher
and
revered
theologian
jeremy
taylor
i
know
it
said
mary
blissfully
folding
her
hands
for
two
hours
the
numbers
of
the
great
jeremy
rolled
forth
like
the
notes
of
an
oratorio
played
on
the
violoncello
mary
sat
gloating
in
the
new
sensation
of
racking
physical
discomfort
that
the
wooden
chair
brought
her
perhaps
there
is
no
happiness
in
life
so
perfect
as
the
martyr
jeremy
minor
chords
soothed
her
like
the
music
of
a
why
oh
why
she
said
to
herself
does
some
one
not
write
words
to
it
at
eleven
they
went
to
church
in
crocusville
the
back
of
the
pine
bench
on
which
she
sat
had
a
penitential
forward
tilt
that
would
have
brought
simeon
down
in
jealousy
from
his
pillar
the
preacher
singled
her
out
and
thundered
upon
her
vicarious
head
the
damnation
of
the
world
at
each
side
of
her
an
adamant
parent
held
her
rigidly
to
the
bar
of
judgment
an
ant
crawled
upon
her
neck
but
she
dared
not
move
she
lowered
her
eyes
before
the
congregation
a
cerberus
that
watched
the
gates
through
which
her
sins
were
fast
thrusting
her
her
soul
was
filled
with
a
delirious
almost
a
fanatic
joy
for
she
was
out
of
the
clutch
of
the
tyrant
freedom
dogma
and
creed
pinioned
her
with
beneficent
cruelty
as
steel
braces
bind
the
feet
of
a
crippled
child
she
was
hedged
adjured
shackled
shored
up
silenced
ordered
when
they
came
out
the
minister
stopped
to
greet
them
mary
could
only
hang
her
head
and
answer
yes
sir
and
no
sir
to
his
questions
when
she
saw
that
the
other
women
carried
their
at
their
waists
with
their
left
hands
she
blushed
and
moved
hers
there
too
from
her
right
she
took
the
train
back
to
the
city
at
nine
she
sat
at
the
round
table
for
dinner
in
the
café
andré
nearly
the
same
crowd
was
there
where
have
you
been
asked
pothunter
i
to
you
at
twelve
i
have
been
away
in
bohemia
answered
mary
with
a
mystic
smile
there
mary
has
given
it
away
she
has
spoiled
my
climax
for
i
was
to
have
told
you
that
bohemia
is
nothing
more
than
the
little
country
in
which
you
do
not
live
if
you
try
to
obtain
citizenship
in
it
at
once
the
court
and
retinue
pack
the
royal
archives
and
treasure
and
move
away
beyond
the
hills
it
is
a
hillside
that
you
turn
your
head
to
peer
at
from
the
windows
of
the
through
express
at
exactly
half
past
eleven
kappelman
deceived
by
a
new
softness
and
slowness
of
riposte
and
parry
in
mary
adrian
tried
to
kiss
her
instantly
she
slapped
his
face
with
such
strength
and
cold
fury
that
he
shrank
down
sobered
with
the
flaming
red
print
of
a
hand
across
his
leering
features
and
all
sounds
ceased
as
when
the
shadows
of
great
wings
come
upon
a
flock
of
chattering
sparrows
one
had
broken
the
paramount
law
of
the
law
of
the
shock
came
not
from
the
blow
delivered
but
from
the
blow
received
with
the
effect
of
a
schoolmaster
entering
the
of
his
pupils
was
that
blow
administered
women
pulled
down
their
sleeves
and
laid
prim
hands
against
their
ruffled
side
locks
men
looked
at
their
watches
there
was
nothing
of
the
effect
of
a
brawl
about
it
it
was
purely
the
still
panic
produced
by
the
sound
of
the
ax
of
the
fly
cop
conscience
hammering
at
the
doors
of
the
heart
with
their
punctilious
putting
on
of
cloaks
with
their
exaggerated
pretense
of
not
having
seen
or
heard
with
their
stammering
exchange
of
unaccustomed
formalities
with
their
false
show
of
a
exit
i
must
take
leave
of
my
bohemian
party
mary
has
robbed
me
of
my
climax
and
she
may
go
but
i
am
not
defeated
somewhere
there
exists
a
great
vault
miles
broad
and
miles
long
more
capacious
than
the
champagne
caves
of
france
in
that
vault
are
stored
the
anticlimaxes
that
should
have
been
tagged
to
all
the
stories
that
have
been
told
in
the
world
i
shall
cheat
that
vault
of
one
deposit
minnie
brown
with
her
aunt
came
from
crocusville
down
to
the
city
to
see
the
sights
and
because
she
had
escorted
me
to
fishless
trout
streams
and
exhibited
to
me
waterfalls
and
broken
my
camera
while
i
julyed
in
her
village
i
must
escort
her
to
the
hives
containing
the
synthetic
clover
honey
of
town
especially
did
the
bohemia
charm
her
the
spaghetti
wound
its
tendrils
about
her
heart
the
free
red
wine
drowned
her
belief
in
the
existence
of
commercialism
in
the
world
she
was
dared
and
enchanted
by
the
rugose
wit
that
can
be
churned
out
of
california
claret
but
one
evening
i
got
her
away
from
the
smell
of
halibut
and
linoleum
long
enough
to
read
to
her
the
manuscript
of
this
story
which
then
ended
before
her
entrance
into
it
i
read
it
to
her
because
i
knew
that
all
the
in
the
world
were
running
to
try
to
please
her
and
some
others
and
i
asked
her
about
it
i
did
quite
catch
the
trains
said
she
how
long
was
mary
in
crocusville
ten
hours
and
five
minutes
i
replied
well
then
the
story
may
do
said
minnie
but
if
she
had
stayed
there
a
week
kappelman
would
have
got
his
kiss
the
ferry
of
unfulfilment
at
the
street
corner
as
solid
as
granite
in
the
tide
of
humanity
stood
the
man
from
nome
the
arctic
winds
and
sun
had
stained
him
his
eye
still
held
the
azure
glint
of
the
glaciers
he
was
as
alert
as
a
fox
as
tough
as
a
caribou
cutlet
and
as
as
the
aurora
borealis
he
stood
sprayed
by
a
niagara
of
sound
the
crash
of
the
elevated
trains
clanging
cars
pounding
of
rubberless
tires
and
the
antiphony
of
the
cab
and
indulging
in
scarifying
repartee
and
so
with
his
gold
dust
cashed
in
to
the
merry
air
of
a
hundred
thousand
and
with
the
cakes
and
ale
of
one
week
in
gotham
turning
bitter
on
his
tongue
the
man
from
nome
sighed
to
set
foot
again
in
chilkoot
the
exit
from
the
land
of
street
noises
and
dead
sea
apple
pies
up
sixth
avenue
with
the
tripping
scurrying
chattering
homing
tide
came
the
girl
from
the
man
from
nome
looked
and
saw
first
that
she
was
supremely
beautiful
after
his
own
conception
of
beauty
and
next
that
she
moved
with
exactly
the
steady
grace
of
a
dog
sled
on
a
level
crust
of
snow
his
third
sensation
was
an
instantaneous
conviction
that
he
desired
her
greatly
for
his
own
this
quickly
do
men
from
nome
make
up
their
minds
besides
he
was
going
back
to
the
north
in
a
short
time
and
to
act
quickly
was
no
less
necessary
a
thousand
girls
from
the
great
department
store
of
flowed
along
the
sidewalk
making
navigation
dangerous
to
men
whose
feminine
field
of
vision
for
three
years
has
been
chiefly
limited
to
siwash
and
chilkat
squaws
but
the
man
from
nome
loyal
to
her
who
had
resurrected
his
long
cached
heart
plunged
into
the
stream
of
pulchritude
and
followed
her
down
street
she
glided
swiftly
looking
to
neither
side
no
more
flirtatious
than
the
bronze
diana
above
the
garden
her
fine
brown
hair
was
neatly
braided
her
neat
waist
and
unwrinkled
black
skirt
were
eloquent
of
the
double
virtues
taste
and
economy
ten
yards
behind
followed
the
smitten
man
from
nome
miss
claribel
colby
the
girl
from
belonged
to
that
sad
company
of
mariners
known
as
jersey
commuters
she
walked
into
the
of
the
ferry
and
up
the
stairs
and
by
a
marvellous
swift
little
run
caught
the
that
was
just
going
out
the
man
from
nome
closed
up
his
ten
yards
in
three
jumps
and
gained
the
deck
close
beside
her
miss
colby
chose
a
rather
lonely
seat
on
the
outside
of
the
the
night
was
not
cold
and
she
desired
to
be
away
from
the
curious
eyes
and
tedious
voices
of
the
passengers
besides
she
was
extremely
weary
and
drooping
from
lack
of
sleep
on
the
previous
night
she
had
graced
the
annual
ball
and
oyster
fry
of
the
west
side
wholesale
fish
dealers
assistants
social
club
no
thus
reducing
her
usual
time
of
sleep
to
only
three
hours
and
the
day
had
been
uncommonly
troublous
customers
had
been
inordinately
trying
the
buyer
in
her
department
had
scolded
her
roundly
for
letting
her
stock
run
down
her
best
friend
mamie
tuthill
had
snubbed
her
by
going
to
lunch
with
that
dockery
girl
the
girl
from
was
in
that
relaxed
softened
mood
that
often
comes
to
the
independent
feminine
it
is
a
mood
most
propitious
for
the
man
who
would
woo
her
then
she
has
yearnings
to
be
set
in
some
home
and
heart
to
be
comforted
and
to
hide
behind
some
strong
arm
and
rest
rest
but
miss
claribel
colby
was
also
very
sleepy
there
came
to
her
side
a
strong
man
browned
and
dressed
carelessly
in
the
best
of
clothes
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
lady
said
the
man
from
nome
respectfully
excuse
me
for
speaking
to
you
but
i
i
i
saw
you
on
the
street
and
and
oh
gee
remarked
the
girl
from
glancing
up
with
the
most
capable
coolness
ai
there
any
way
to
ever
get
rid
of
you
mashers
i
tried
everything
from
eating
onions
to
using
hatpins
be
on
your
way
freddie
i
not
one
of
that
kind
lady
said
the
man
from
nome
honest
i
not
as
i
say
i
saw
you
on
the
street
and
i
wanted
to
know
you
so
bad
i
could
help
followin
after
you
i
was
afraid
i
ever
see
you
again
in
this
big
town
unless
i
spoke
and
that
why
i
done
so
miss
colby
looked
once
shrewdly
at
him
in
the
dim
light
on
the
no
he
did
not
have
the
perfidious
smirk
or
the
brazen
swagger
of
the
sincerity
and
modesty
shone
through
his
boreal
tan
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
might
be
good
to
hear
a
little
of
what
he
had
to
say
you
may
sit
down
she
said
laying
her
hand
over
a
yawn
with
ostentatious
politness
and
mind
do
get
fresh
or
i
call
the
steward
the
man
from
nome
sat
by
her
side
he
admired
her
greatly
he
more
than
admired
her
she
had
exactly
the
looks
he
had
tried
so
long
in
vain
to
find
in
a
woman
could
she
ever
come
to
like
him
well
that
was
to
be
seen
he
must
do
all
in
his
power
to
stake
his
claim
anyhow
my
name
blayden
said
he
henry
blayden
are
you
real
sure
it
ai
jones
asked
the
girl
leaning
toward
him
with
delicious
knowing
raillery
i
down
from
nome
he
went
on
with
anxious
seriousness
i
scraped
together
a
pretty
good
lot
of
dust
up
there
and
brought
it
down
with
me
oh
say
she
rippled
pursuing
persiflage
with
engaging
lightness
then
you
must
be
on
the
white
wings
force
i
thought
i
seen
you
somewhere
you
did
see
me
on
the
street
when
i
saw
you
i
never
look
at
fellows
on
the
street
well
i
looked
at
you
and
i
never
looked
at
anything
before
that
i
thought
was
half
as
pretty
shall
i
keep
the
change
yes
i
reckon
so
i
reckon
you
could
keep
anything
i
got
i
reckon
i
what
you
would
call
a
rough
man
but
i
could
be
awful
good
to
anybody
i
liked
i
had
a
rough
time
of
it
up
yonder
but
i
beat
the
game
nearly
ounces
of
dust
was
what
i
cleaned
up
while
i
was
there
goodness
exclaimed
miss
colby
obligingly
sympathetic
it
must
be
an
awful
dirty
place
wherever
it
is
and
then
her
eyes
closed
the
voice
of
the
man
from
nome
had
a
monotony
in
its
very
earnestness
besides
what
dull
talk
was
this
of
brooms
and
sweeping
and
dust
she
leaned
her
head
back
against
the
wall
miss
said
the
man
from
nome
with
deeper
earnestness
and
monotony
i
never
saw
anybody
i
liked
as
well
as
i
do
you
i
know
you
ca
think
that
way
of
me
right
yet
but
ca
you
give
me
a
chance
wo
you
let
me
know
you
and
see
if
i
ca
make
you
like
me
the
head
of
the
girl
from
slid
over
gently
and
rested
upon
his
shoulder
sweet
sleep
had
won
her
and
she
was
dreaming
rapturously
of
the
wholesale
fish
dealers
assistants
ball
the
gentleman
from
nome
kept
his
arms
to
himself
he
did
not
suspect
sleep
and
yet
he
was
too
wise
to
attribute
the
movement
to
surrender
he
was
greatly
and
blissfully
thrilled
but
he
ended
by
regarding
the
head
upon
his
shoulder
as
an
encouraging
preliminary
merely
advanced
as
a
harbinger
of
his
success
and
not
to
be
taken
advantage
of
one
small
speck
of
alloy
discounted
the
gold
of
his
satisfaction
had
he
spoken
too
freely
of
his
wealth
he
wanted
to
be
liked
for
himself
i
want
to
say
miss
he
said
that
you
can
count
on
me
they
know
me
in
the
klondike
from
juneau
to
circle
city
and
down
the
whole
length
of
the
yukon
many
a
night
i
laid
in
the
snow
up
there
where
i
worked
like
a
slave
for
three
years
and
wondered
if
ever
have
anybody
to
like
me
i
did
want
all
that
dust
just
myself
i
thought
i
meet
just
the
right
one
some
time
and
i
done
it
money
a
mighty
good
thing
to
have
but
to
have
the
love
of
the
one
you
like
best
is
better
still
if
you
was
ever
to
marry
a
man
miss
which
would
you
rather
he
have
cash
the
word
came
sharply
and
loudly
from
miss
colby
lips
giving
evidence
that
in
her
dreams
she
was
now
behind
her
counter
in
the
great
department
store
of
her
head
suddenly
bobbed
over
sideways
she
awoke
sat
straight
and
rubbed
her
eyes
the
man
from
nome
was
gone
gee
i
believe
i
been
asleep
said
miss
colby
wonder
what
became
of
the
white
wings
the
tale
of
a
tainted
tenner
money
talks
but
you
may
think
that
the
conversation
of
a
little
old
bill
in
new
york
would
be
nothing
more
than
a
whisper
oh
very
well
pass
up
this
autobiography
of
an
x
if
you
like
if
you
are
one
of
the
kind
that
prefers
to
listen
to
john
d
checkbook
roar
at
you
through
a
megaphone
as
it
passes
by
all
right
but
do
forget
that
small
change
can
say
a
word
to
the
point
now
and
then
the
next
time
you
tip
your
grocer
clerk
a
silver
quarter
to
give
you
extra
weight
of
his
boss
goods
read
the
four
words
above
the
lady
head
how
are
they
for
repartee
i
am
a
treasury
note
series
of
you
may
have
seen
one
in
a

a
picture
of
the
bison

miscalled
a
buffalo

fifty
or
sixty
millions
of
americans
the
heads
of
capt

and

the

on
my
back

the
graceful

uncle
sam
will
hand
you
over
his
counter
if
you
want
to
cash
me
in
i
beg
you
will
excuse
any
conversational
breaks
that
i
make
thanks
i
knew
you
would
got
that
sneaking
little
respect
and
agreeable
feeling
toward
even
an
x
have
you
you
see
a
tainted
bill
does
have
much
chance
to
acquire
a
correct
form
of
expression
i
never
knew
a
really
cultured
and
educated
person
that
could
afford
to
hold
a
any
longer
than
it
would
take
to
do
an
arthur
duffy
to
the
nearest
that
all
sign
or
delicatessen
store
for
a
i
had
a
lively
and
gorgeous
circulation
i
guess
i
paid
as
many
debts
as
the
man
who
dies
i
been
owned
by
a
good
many
kinds
of
people
but
a
little
old
ragged
damp
dingy
silver
certificate
gave
me
a
jar
one
day
i
was
next
to
it
in
the
fat
and
purse
of
a
butcher
hey
you
sitting
bull
says
i
do
scrouge
so
anyhow
you
think
it
about
time
you
went
in
on
a
customs
payment
and
got
reissued
for
a
series
of
you
a
sight
oh
do
get
crackly
just
because
you
a
buffalo
bill
says
the
fiver
you
be
limp
too
if
you
been
stuffed
down
in
a
thick
under
an
elastic
all
day
and
the
thermometer
not
a
degree
under
in
the
store
i
never
heard
of
a
pocketbook
like
that
says
i
who
carried
you
a
shopgirl
says
the
what
that
i
had
to
ask
you
never
know
till
their
millennium
comes
says
the
fiver
just
then
a
bill
behind
me
with
a
george
washington
head
spoke
up
to
the
fiver
aw
cut
out
yer
kicks
ai
lisle
thread
good
enough
for
yer
if
you
was
under
all
cotton
like
i
been
and
choked
up
with
factory
dust
till
the
lady
with
the
cornucopia
on
me
sneezed
half
a
dozen
times
you
have
some
reason
to
complain
that
was
the
next
day
after
i
arrived
in
new
york
i
came
in
a
package
of
tens
to
a
brooklyn
bank
from
one
of
its
pennsylvania
correspondents
and
i
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
any
of
the
five
and
two
spot
friends
pocketbooks
yet
silk
for
mine
every
time
i
was
lucky
money
i
kept
on
the
move
sometimes
i
changed
hands
twenty
times
a
day
i
saw
the
inside
of
every
business
i
fought
for
my
owner
every
pleasure
it
seemed
that
on
saturday
nights
i
never
missed
being
slapped
down
on
a
bar
tens
were
always
slapped
down
while
ones
and
twos
were
slid
over
to
the
bartenders
folded
i
got
in
the
habit
of
looking
for
mine
and
i
managed
to
soak
in
a
little
straight
or
some
spilled
martini
or
manhattan
whenever
i
could
once
i
got
tied
up
in
a
great
greasy
roll
of
bills
in
a
pushcart
peddler
jeans
i
thought
i
never
would
get
in
circulation
again
for
the
future
department
store
owner
lived
on
eight
cents
worth
of
dog
meat
and
onions
a
day
but
this
peddler
got
into
trouble
one
day
on
account
of
having
his
cart
too
near
a
crossing
and
i
was
rescued
i
always
will
feel
grateful
to
the
cop
that
got
me
he
changed
me
at
a
cigar
store
near
the
bowery
that
was
running
a
crap
game
in
the
back
room
so
it
was
the
captain
of
the
precinct
after
all
that
did
me
the
best
turn
when
he
got
his
he
blew
me
for
wine
the
next
evening
in
a
broadway
restaurant
and
i
really
felt
as
glad
to
get
back
again
as
an
astor
does
when
he
sees
the
lights
of
charing
cross
a
tainted
ten
certainly
does
get
action
on
broadway
i
was
alimony
once
and
got
folded
in
a
little
dogskin
purse
among
a
lot
of
dimes
they
were
bragging
about
the
busy
times
there
were
in
ossining
whenever
three
girls
got
hold
of
one
of
them
during
the
ice
cream
season
but
it
slow
moving
vehicles
keep
to
the
right
for
the
little
bok
tips
when
you
think
of
the
way
we
bison
plasters
refuse
to
stick
to
anything
during
the
rush
lobster
hour
the
first
i
ever
heard
of
tainted
money
was
one
night
when
a
good
thing
with
a
van
to
his
name
threw
me
over
with
some
other
bills
to
buy
a
stack
of
blues
about
midnight
a
big
man
with
a
fat
face
like
a
and
the
eye
of
a
janitor
with
his
wages
raised
took
me
and
a
lot
of
other
notes
and
rolled
us
into
what
is
termed
a
wad
among
the
money
tainters
ticket
me
for
five
hundred
said
he
to
the
banker
and
look
out
for
everything
charlie
i
going
out
for
a
stroll
in
the
glen
before
the
moonlight
fades
from
the
brow
of
the
cliff
if
anybody
finds
the
roof
in
their
way
there
wrapped
in
a
comic
supplement
in
the
upper
corner
of
the
safe
be
bold
everywhere
be
bold
but
be
not
bowled
over
i
found
myself
between
two
gold
certificates
one
of
says
to
me
well
old
shorthorn
you
in
luck
you
see
something
of
life
old
jack
going
to
make
the
tenderloin
look
like
a
hamburg
steak
explain
says
i
i
used
to
joints
but
i
do
care
for
filet
mignon
with
the
kind
of
sauce
you
serve
me
said
the
twenty
old
jack
is
the
proprietor
of
this
gambling
house
he
going
on
a
whiz
because
he
offered
to
a
church
and
it
refused
to
accept
it
because
they
said
his
money
was
tainted
what
is
a
church
i
asked
oh
i
forgot
says
the
twenty
that
i
was
talking
to
a
tenner
of
course
you
do
know
you
too
much
to
put
into
the
contribution
basket
and
not
enough
to
buy
anything
at
a
bazaar
a
church
is
a
large
building
in
which
penwipers
and
tidies
are
sold
at
each
i
do
care
much
about
chinning
with
gold
certificates
there
a
streak
of
yellow
in
all
is
not
gold
that
quitters
old
jack
certainly
was
a
sport
when
it
came
his
time
to
loosen
up
he
never
referred
the
waiter
to
an
actuary
by
and
by
it
got
around
that
he
was
smiting
the
rock
in
the
wilderness
and
all
along
broadway
things
with
cold
noses
and
hot
gullets
fell
in
on
our
trail
the
third
jungle
book
was
there
waiting
for
somebody
to
put
covers
on
it
old
jack
money
may
have
had
a
taint
to
it
but
all
the
same
he
had
orders
for
his
camembert
piling
up
on
him
every
minute
first
his
friends
rallied
round
him
and
then
the
fellows
that
his
friends
knew
by
sight
and
then
a
few
of
his
enemies
buried
the
hatchet
and
finally
he
was
buying
souvenirs
for
so
many
neapolitan
fisher
maidens
and
butterfly
octettes
that
the
head
waiters
were
all
over
town
for
julian
mitchell
to
please
come
around
and
get
them
into
some
kind
of
order
at
last
we
floated
into
an
uptown
café
that
i
knew
by
heart
when
the
union
in
jackets
and
aprons
saw
us
coming
the
chief
goal
kicker
called
out
six
eleven
nineteen
twelve
to
his
men
and
they
put
on
nose
guards
till
it
was
clear
whether
we
meant
port
arthur
or
portsmouth
but
old
jack
was
working
for
the
furniture
and
glass
factories
that
night
he
sat
down
quiet
and
sang
ramble
in
a
way
his
feelings
had
been
hurt
so
the
twenty
told
me
because
his
offer
to
the
church
had
been
refused
but
the
wassail
went
on
and
brady
himself
could
have
hammered
the
thirst
mob
into
a
better
imitation
of
the
real
penchant
for
the
stuff
that
you
screw
out
of
a
bottle
with
a
napkin
old
jack
paid
the
twenty
above
me
for
a
round
leaving
me
on
the
outside
of
his
roll
he
laid
the
roll
on
the
table
and
sent
for
the
proprietor
mike
says
he
here
money
that
the
good
people
have
refused
will
it
buy
of
your
wares
in
the
name
of
the
devil
they
say
tainted
i
will
says
mike
and
i
put
it
in
the
drawer
next
to
the
bills
that
was
paid
to
the
parson
daughter
for
kisses
at
the
church
fair
to
build
a
new
parsonage
for
the
parson
daughter
to
live
in
at
when
the
were
making
ready
to
close
up
the
front
and
keep
the
inside
open
a
woman
slips
in
the
door
of
the
restaurant
and
comes
up
to
old
jack
table
you
seen
the
kind
black
shawl
creepy
hair
ragged
skirt
white
face
eyes
a
cross
between
gabriel
and
a
sick
kitten
the
kind
of
woman
that
always
on
the
lookout
for
an
automobile
or
the
mendicancy
squad
and
she
stands
there
without
a
word
and
looks
at
the
money
old
jack
gets
up
peels
me
off
the
roll
and
hands
me
to
her
with
a
bow
madam
says
he
just
like
actors
i
heard
here
is
a
tainted
bill
i
am
a
gambler
this
bill
came
to
me
from
a
gentleman
son
where
he
got
it
i
do
not
know
if
you
will
do
me
the
favor
to
accept
it
it
is
yours
the
woman
took
me
with
a
trembling
hand
sir
said
she
i
counted
thousands
of
this
issue
of
bills
into
packages
when
they
were
virgin
from
the
presses
i
was
a
clerk
in
the
treasury
department
there
was
an
official
to
whom
i
owed
my
position
you
say
they
are
tainted
now
if
you
only
knew
but
i
wo
say
any
more
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
sir
thank
you
thank
you
where
do
you
suppose
that
woman
carried
me
almost
at
a
run
to
a
bakery
away
from
old
jack
and
a
sizzling
good
time
to
a
bakery
and
i
get
changed
and
she
does
a
with
a
dozen
rolls
and
a
section
of
jelly
cake
as
big
as
a
turbine
of
course
i
lost
sight
of
her
then
for
i
was
snowed
up
in
the
bakery
wondering
whether
i
get
changed
at
the
drug
store
the
next
day
in
an
alum
deal
or
paid
over
to
the
cement
works
a
week
afterward
i
butted
up
against
one
of
the
bills
the
baker
had
given
the
woman
for
change
hallo
says
i
were
you
in
the
change
for
me
in
a
bakery
last
saturday
night
yep
says
the
solitaire
in
his
free
and
easy
style
how
did
the
deal
turn
out
i
asked
she
blew
for
mills
and
round
steak
says
the
she
kept
me
till
the
rent
man
came
it
was
a
bum
room
with
a
sick
kid
in
it
but
you
ought
to
have
seen
him
go
for
the
bread
and
tincture
of
formaldehyde
i
guess
then
she
prayed
some
do
get
stuck
up
tenner
we
hear
ten
prayers
where
you
hear
one
she
said
something
about
giveth
to
the
poor
oh
let
cut
out
the
slum
talk
i
certainly
tired
of
the
company
that
keeps
me
i
wish
i
was
big
enough
to
move
in
society
with
you
tainted
bills
shut
up
says
i
there
no
such
thing
i
know
the
rest
of
it
there
a
to
the
lord
somewhere
in
it
now
look
on
my
back
and
read
what
you
see
there
this
note
is
a
legal
tender
at
its
face
value
for
all
debts
public
and
private
this
talk
about
tainted
money
makes
me
tired
says
elsie
in
new
york
no
bumptious
reader
this
story
is
not
a
continuation
of
the
elsie
series
but
if
your
elsie
had
lived
over
here
in
our
big
city
there
might
have
been
a
chapter
in
her
books
not
very
different
from
this
especially
for
the
vagrant
feet
of
youth
are
the
roads
of
manhattan
beset
with
pitfall
and
with
gin
but
the
civic
guardians
of
the
young
have
made
themselves
acquainted
with
the
snares
of
the
wicked
and
most
of
the
dangerous
paths
are
patrolled
by
their
agents
who
seek
to
turn
straying
ones
away
from
the
peril
that
menaces
them
and
this
will
tell
you
how
they
guided
my
elsie
safely
through
all
peril
to
the
goal
that
she
was
seeking
elsie
father
had
been
a
cutter
for
fox
otter
cloaks
and
furs
on
lower
broadway
he
was
an
old
man
with
a
slow
and
limping
gait
so
a
of
a
newly
licensed
chauffeur
ran
him
down
one
day
when
livelier
game
was
scarce
they
took
the
old
man
home
where
he
lay
on
his
bed
for
a
year
and
then
died
leaving
in
cash
and
a
letter
from
mr
otter
offering
to
do
anything
he
could
to
help
his
faithful
old
employee
the
old
cutter
regarded
this
letter
as
a
valuable
legacy
to
his
daughter
and
he
put
it
into
her
hands
with
pride
as
the
shears
of
the
dread
cleaner
and
repairer
snipped
off
his
thread
of
life
that
was
the
landlord
cue
and
forth
he
came
and
did
his
part
in
the
great
eviction
scene
there
was
no
snowstorm
ready
for
elsie
to
steal
out
into
drawing
her
little
red
woollen
shawl
about
her
shoulders
but
she
went
out
regardless
of
the
unities
and
as
for
the
red
shawl
back
to
blaney
with
it
elsie
fall
tan
coat
was
cheap
but
it
had
the
style
and
fit
of
the
best
at
fox
otter
and
her
lucky
stars
had
given
her
good
looks
and
eyes
as
blue
and
innocent
as
the
new
shade
of
note
paper
and
she
had
left
of
the
and
the
letter
from
mr
otter
keep
your
eye
on
the
letter
from
mr
otter
that
is
the
clue
i
desire
that
everything
be
made
plain
as
we
go
detective
stories
are
so
plentiful
now
that
they
do
not
sell
and
so
we
find
elsie
thus
equipped
starting
out
in
the
world
to
seek
her
fortune
one
trouble
about
the
letter
from
mr
otter
was
that
it
did
not
bear
the
new
address
of
the
firm
which
had
moved
about
a
month
before
but
elsie
thought
she
could
find
it
she
had
heard
that
policemen
when
politely
addressed
or
thumbscrewed
by
an
investigation
committee
will
give
up
information
and
addresses
so
she
boarded
a
downtown
car
at
one
hundred
and
street
and
rode
south
to
which
she
thought
must
surely
be
the
end
of
the
island
there
she
stood
against
the
wall
undecided
for
the
city
roar
and
dash
was
new
to
her
up
where
she
had
lived
was
rural
new
york
so
far
out
that
the
milkmen
awaken
you
in
the
morning
by
the
squeaking
of
pumps
instead
of
the
rattling
of
cans
a
sunburned
young
man
in
a
hat
went
past
elsie
into
the
grand
central
depot
that
was
hank
ross
of
the
sunflower
ranch
in
idaho
on
his
way
home
from
a
visit
to
the
east
hank
heart
was
heavy
for
the
sunflower
ranch
was
a
lonesome
place
lacking
the
presence
of
a
woman
he
had
hoped
to
find
one
during
his
visit
who
would
congenially
share
his
prosperity
and
home
but
the
girls
of
gotham
had
not
pleased
his
fancy
but
as
he
passed
in
he
noted
with
a
jumping
of
his
pulses
the
sweet
ingenuous
face
of
elsie
and
her
pose
of
doubt
and
loneliness
with
true
and
honest
western
impulse
he
said
to
himself
that
here
was
his
mate
he
could
love
her
he
knew
and
he
would
surround
her
with
so
much
comfort
and
cherish
her
so
carefully
that
she
would
be
happy
and
make
two
sunflowers
grow
on
the
ranch
where
there
grew
but
one
before
hank
turned
and
went
back
to
her
backed
by
his
never
before
questioned
honesty
of
purpose
he
approached
the
girl
and
removed
his
hat
elsie
had
but
time
to
sum
up
his
handsome
frank
face
with
one
shy
look
of
modest
admiration
when
a
burly
cop
hurled
himself
upon
the
ranchman
seized
him
by
the
collar
and
backed
him
against
the
wall
two
blocks
away
a
burglar
was
coming
out
of
an
with
a
bag
of
silverware
on
his
shoulder
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
carry
on
yez
mashin
tricks
right
before
me
eyes
will
yez
shouted
the
cop
i
teach
yez
to
speak
to
ladies
on
me
beat
that
ye
not
acquainted
with
come
along
elsie
turned
away
with
a
sigh
as
the
ranchman
was
dragged
away
she
had
liked
the
effect
of
his
light
blue
eyes
against
his
tanned
complexion
she
walked
southward
thinking
herself
already
in
the
district
where
her
father
used
to
work
and
hoping
to
find
some
one
who
could
direct
her
to
the
firm
of
fox
otter
but
did
she
want
to
find
mr
otter
she
had
inherited
much
of
the
old
cutter
independence
how
much
better
it
would
be
if
she
could
find
work
and
support
herself
without
calling
on
him
for
aid
elsie
saw
a
sign
employment
agency
and
went
in
many
girls
were
sitting
against
the
wall
in
chairs
several
ladies
were
looking
them
over
one
old
lady
in
rustling
black
silk
hurried
up
to
elsie

young
woman
with

on
her
bony
nose
and
her
hands
in

there

in
our

the
third
sunday
of
every

elsie
hurried
away
after
thanking
miss
ticklebaum
for
her
timely
warning
and
advice
after
all
it
seemed
that
she
must
try
to
find
mr
otter
but
after
walking
a
few
blocks
she
saw
a
sign
cashier
wanted
in
the
window
of
a
confectionery
store
in
she
went
and
applied
for
the
place
after
casting
a
quick
glance
over
her
shoulder
to
assure
herself
that
the
was
not
on
her
trail
the
proprietor
of
the
confectionery
was
a
benevolent
old
man
with
a
peppermint
flavor
who
decided
after
questioning
elsie
pretty
closely
that
she
was
the
very
girl
he
wanted
her
services
were
needed
at
once
so
elsie
with
a
thankful
heart
drew
off
her
tan
coat
and
prepared
to
mount
the
cashier
stool
but
before
she
could
do
so
a
gaunt
lady
wearing
steel
spectacles
and
black
mittens
stood
before
her
with
a
long
finger
pointing
and
exclaimed
young
woman
hesitate
elsie
hesitated
do
you
know
said
the
lady
that
in
accepting
this
position
you
may
this
day
cause
the
loss
of
a
hundred
lives
in
agonizing
physical
torture
and
the
sending
as
many
souls
to
perdition
why
no
said
elsie
in
frightened
tones
how
could
i
do
that
rum
said
the
lady
the
demon
rum
do
you
know
why
so
many
lives
are
lost
when
a
theatre
catches
fire
brandy
balls
the
demon
rum
lurking
in
brandy
balls
our
society
women
while
in
theatres
sit
grossly
intoxicated
from
eating
these
candies
filled
with
brandy
when
the
fire
fiend
sweeps
down
upon
them
they
are
unable
to
escape
the
candy
stores
are
the
devil
distilleries
if
you
assist
in
the
distribution
of
these
insidious
confections
you
assist
in
the
destruction
of
the
bodies
and
souls
of
your
and
in
the
filling
of
our
jails
asylums
and
almshouses
think
girl
ere
you
touch
the
money
for
which
brandy
balls
are
sold
dear
me
said
elsie
bewildered
i
did
know
there
was
rum
in
brandy
balls
but
i
must
live
by
some
means
what
shall
i
do
decline
the
position
said
the
lady
and
come
with
me
i
will
tell
you
what
to
do
after
elsie
had
told
the
confectioner
that
she
had
changed
her
mind
about
the
cashiership
she
put
on
her
coat
and
followed
the
lady
to
the
sidewalk
where
awaited
an
elegant
victoria
seek
some
other
work
said
the
lady
and
assist
in
crushing

demon
rum

she
got
into
the
victoria
and
drove
away

mr
otter

elsie
ruefully
turning
down
the
street
and
i
sorry

much
rather
make
my
way
without

near
fourteenth
street
elsie

tacked
on
the

of
a
doorway
that
read
fifty
girls
neat
sewers
wanted
immediately
on
theatrical
costumes

was
about

a
solemn
man
dressed

hand
on
her
arm
my
dear
girl
he
said
i

exclaimed
elsie
with
some
impatience

a
cinch
on
all
the
business
in
new
york
what

about
the
place

here
said
the
solemn
man
that

satan
in
other
words
the
costumes
worn
on
the
stage
are
manufactured
the
stage
is
the
road
to
ruin
and
destruction

you
imperil
your
soul
by
lending
the
work
of
your
hands
to
its
support
do
you
know
my
dear
girl

on
her
way

was
soon
in
the
downtown
district
where
factories
abound
on
a
large
brick
building
was
a
gilt
sign
posey
trimmer
artificial
flowers
below

twenty
or
thirty
girls

said
elsie
she
walked
aimlessly
eastward
on
broadway
and
there
her
heart
leaped
to
see
the
sign
fox
otter
stretching
entirely
across
the
front
of
a
tall
building
it
was
as
though
an
unseen
guide
had
led
her
to
it
through
the
of
her
fruitless
search
for
work
she
hurried
into
the
store
and
sent
in
to
mr
otter
by
a
clerk
her
name
and
the
letter
he
had
written
her
father
she
was
shown
directly
into
his
private
office
mr
otter
arose
from
his
desk
as
elsie
entered
and
took
both
hands
with
a
hearty
smile
of
welcome
he
was
a
slightly
corpulent
man
of
nearly
middle
age
a
little
bald
gold
spectacled
polite
well
dressed
radiating
well
well
and
so
this
is
beatty
little
daughter
your
father
was
one
of
our
most
efficient
and
valued
employees

left
nothing
well
well

not
forgotten
his
faithful
services

a
vacancy
now
among
our
models
oh

is
easy
work

struck
a
bell
a

before
the
mirror
with
pink
cheeks
and
quick
breath
her
eyes
shone
like
faint
stars
she
was
beautiful
alas

was
beautiful
i
wish
i

stop
this
story
here
confound
it
i
will
no

to
run
it
out
i
did
make
it
up
i
just
repeating
it
i
like
to
throw
bouquets
at
the
wise
cop
and
the
lady
who
rescues
girls
from
jobs
and
the
prohibitionist
who
is
trying
to
crush
brandy
balls
and
the
sky
pilot
who
objects
to
costumes
for
stage
people
there
are
others
and
all
the
thousands
of
good
people
who
are
at
work
protecting
young
people
from
the
pitfalls
of
a
great
city
and
then
wind
up
by
pointing
out
how
they
were
the
means
of
elsie
reaching
her
father
benefactor
and
her
kind
friend
and
rescuer
from
poverty
this
would
make
a
fine
elsie
story
of
the
old
sort
i
like
to
do
this
but
there
just
a
word
or
two
to
follow
while
elsie
was
admiring
herself
in
the
mirror
mr
otter

to
the
telephone
booth
and
called
